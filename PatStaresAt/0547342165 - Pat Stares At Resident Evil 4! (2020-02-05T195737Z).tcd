[0:32:13] <%domokun124> after working in a warehiuse in the summer with no air conditioning I know that ball sweat feel
[0:32:13] <%Ganerumo> Only thing that kills my appetite is seeing sex for some reason
[0:32:13] <%BallerSwagBro9k> I cant handle surgery. It makes me sick
[0:32:16] <Bailey__gaming> he Scream
[0:32:17] <%SoFarFetched> I ate ice cream while watching 2girls1cup many years ago, I was dead inside at that time.
[0:32:18] <cureneckbeard> But you won't eat on stream
[0:32:18] <%bigdumbidiotguy> people are different???
[0:32:18] <%vG_Chance> i agree with that statement

[0:32:31] <+Remery_> Surgery is so cool.
[0:32:33] <%Bane_Kaikyo> <3
[0:32:33] <%ElenaManetta> The only time I lost my appetite was during an actual survivor story where they re-enacted the moment the survivors resorted to cannibalism and my chicken sandwich looked a lot like shredded human meat in the re-enactment
[0:32:33] <%Teintstein> What about goo on your controller though?
[0:32:34] <%barkon345> My dad used to watch surgery shows while we ate dinner when I was a kid
[0:32:34] <Valentinius_Anodyne> I don't like the body talk because it reminds me of the weakness of my own fleshy corpus
[0:32:34] <%cowardman93> feeling sweaty feels super fucking gross so I get that feeling
[0:32:35] <%Squirtydirtturd> We don’t care pat! We’re the heroes of our story so youre WRONG

[0:35:02] <%ittla> the nice thing is that samurai is fairly simple so it wont be trouble to set it up

[0:35:21] <+Pendragwn> @Dingalow because it got dick in it

[0:35:36] <%Verd_254> psaElmo
[0:35:36] <%SpcOpsBear> @Dingalow the same reason why armpit sweat smells different than regular sweat - certain parts of the anatomy produce sweat that is more pungent
[0:35:38] <daisyyyy> Pat was still stoned then

[0:35:54] <Deadman_Reborn> i like dogs better than cats
[0:36:01] <%segonian> does Pat neet more reinforcement? he's basically ready to destroy the world, he just needs more POWER

The only things I know about those game's stories is that 1 girl is a android, and also the last thing the P3 protagonist does. Also Im at 20 months, but Twitch hasnt been letting me share it.

[0:49:48] <%ThirdWelles> @jillvxlentine He mentioned it on the podcast the week before last. He's said it makes it look better, but it does its job of making the game look dirty and grungy
[0:49:48] <MrWummzy> Welcum to the casting couch
[0:49:48] <TheMirai> Originally there was a plate of bacon and a sign that said "Free Bacon For President Daughters"

[0:51:43] <%ElenaManetta> UHHHH
[0:51:43] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @PatStaresAt Fun fact: That audio of the Novistador running just now was once part of a removed cutscene. In the GC version, you could glitch out of the map and be able trigger this scene. The scene is reminiscent of the Hunter First Person scene in REmake. They simply never took out the audio and kept in in for all versions

[0:51:56] <%jillvxlentine> but the striker can get 100 shells with its exclusive upgrade
[0:51:59] <King_thunder365> @JJCheeker A Palazar (Pat as Salazar) emote, maybe?

[1:08:31] <TomFrank> i wish leon could wear the mask
[1:08:32] <SoaringLettuce> why not use your pocket nuke?
[1:08:33] <%ElenaManetta> These HD items are great looking
[1:08:34] <%majima666> he snorted one weed and he feels no need to be angry anymore
[1:08:36] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Alas, it seems that Monsieur Claw has gotten the brain worms
[1:08:37] <%Aydarkzero> nah can't shoot it
[1:08:47] <%Aydarkzero> Xur!
[1:08:47] <%SirGO0SE> use da weed to cure da angry
[1:08:50] <xxHungryxx> Best thing about RE4 is merchant
[1:08:53] <dukenux> @TomFrank man, if Leon could put all the gold crap he finds on himself
[1:08:55] <KaiserMario> Remeber when Nero brought down that chandelier?
[1:08:58] <cosmeleon> WWWWELCOME
[1:09:03] <+necrocannibal2> how come they never brought the merchant back?
[1:09:03] <CookieCutter007> eheheheh thank you
[1:09:05] <HealingMind> Pat did you know, if you shoot the merchant you get the super flamethrower? Cheat Code Central told me so.
[1:09:05] <%Ipsenscastle> One time he's gonna say welcome and there'll be no clothes under that coat
[1:09:06] <dukenux> HEHEHE Thank You
[1:09:06] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @commanderclaw To be fair its a very common game mechanic
[1:09:07] <cureneckbeard> heh heh heh
[1:09:10] <%rumtumtugnutz> that guy wants to sell you drugs. Or dick.
[1:09:12] <%Aydarkzero> no red eye? rip
[1:09:14] <+ConLin_Arts_> do you ever get any explanation on who the merchant is??
[1:09:15] <AllTheZibas> Ahhhhh
[1:09:17] <TomFrank> @dukenux with the gangster costume too
[1:09:17] <cosmeleon> AHHH ILL BUY IT AT A HIGH PRICE
[1:09:20] <+necrocannibal2> AAAAAA I'LL BUY IT AT A HIGH PRICE
[1:09:22] <%doc_ock_rokc> Man the merchant needs to come back
[1:09:29] <+professormorrigan> Is the merchant infected with Plagas?
[1:09:29] <professorno> Hehe thank you
[1:09:30] <%AdamTheJaggi> how do leon's ankles and/or knees not just explode from the jumps he makes?
[1:09:32] <tonfirean> That's right, I heard the story, over and over and over and over and over and over
[1:09:32] <chhdez> El Buhonero
[1:09:39] <%Ipsenscastle> Merchant is Barry
[1:09:39] <%ElenaManetta> Why can't there be a dating element in this game where giving Ashly the surplus of jewelry boosts her stats. psaJpeg psaJpeg psaJpeg psaJpeg
[1:09:41] <%SirGO0SE> he needs the most lore
[1:09:43] <%ExpressNode> He wheels and he deals
[1:09:43] <trianglehat> he's a merchant he has ALL the deals
[1:09:44] <%Pesuto> He's just there
[1:09:45] <%peachy996> I hope the Merchant comes back and gets NO EXPLANATION
[1:09:46] <majindusto> Hes clearly infected
[1:09:46] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Ive always wondered too
[1:09:47] <%Pesuto> He wants money
[1:09:50] <+Pendragwn> what a deep lore
[1:09:50] <%zamzoph> deepest lore PogChamp
[1:09:52] <CamiHeart> He has GREAT deals!
[1:09:52] <Ultimatefool> Wait, Pat didn't reload till he got all Blue eyes from the Novistadors????
[1:09:53] <%Aydarkzero> he's just a dude who wants to see some cool shit
[1:09:53] <%rumtumtugnutz> the merchant is Leon from the past.
[1:09:55] <misterspotswood> don worry bout it
[1:09:55] <dukenux> He's so greedy, the Plagas has no effect on him
[1:09:56] <DeltaPangaea> Mysterious Merchant is a classic thing.
[1:09:56] <+dandybrains> he's crazy about those prices
[1:09:56] <%theKingRamses> seems legit
[1:09:58] <%ironohki> "Because shut up."
[1:09:59] <Shwepie> But he's got the plagas eyes!
[1:10:00] <xxHungryxx> isnt merchant a secret boss
[1:10:00] <%rytisone> some mystery is good in horror fiction
[1:10:01] <%KENTASHIRO> he wants you to know you can come back anytime, that's all that really mattress
[1:10:01] <%ittla> funny gameplay mechanic man
[1:10:01] <%MajorCrasher> LUL
[1:10:03] <chhdez> The answer is el buhonero
[1:10:03] <+StrawberryPantsu> I wish he was in 5 and 6
[1:10:04] <BananaF4p> he is a zombie from res2
[1:10:04] <DeltaPangaea> Him not having a 'thing' makes him more interesting.
[1:10:04] <$Hommando> It's Steve
[1:10:04] <Valentinius_Anodyne> What about the time where there's two of them tho
[1:10:05] <YaiGameworks> The answer is Mikami doesn't give a fuck
[1:10:06] <+EleazarTheSkeleton> and the floor is floor
[1:10:07] <%XeroSigmaPrime> ROCKET TIME BABY
[1:10:07] <DarkItchay> he is leon.s hallucination
[1:10:08] <OkamiDude15> so the deal is that sparda woke up to justice and stopped the demons. and then he had kids named dante and vergil
[1:10:08] <TomFrank> hes an allegory for weapons dealers that sell weapons to both sides of conflict
[1:10:09] <%BallerSwagBro9k> BUT THE LORE. I MUST KNOW
[1:10:10] <%Ipsenscastle> Merchant is Barry in deep cover
[1:10:11] <SuperHoppedUp> Maybe the merchant is a tyrant
[1:10:12] <+StrawberryPantsu> OH FUCK THIS PART
[1:10:13] <+RadDude6969> maybe he's Billy Coenn
[1:10:14] <dukenux> Is there a Cronos one?
[1:10:15] <+DinnerCalzone> SourPls
[1:10:17] <%WackyXmand> he doesn't need a story, it's like most of the DMC lore, who cares it's cool and funny
[1:10:20] <%majima666> there was going to be a merchant in re5 but they cut it
[1:10:22] <%Sir_stride> oh boy this gauntlet
[1:10:23] <+Remery_> I thought the merchant was a secret company you could unlock
[1:10:23] <%EuropanLamprey> The answer is he's a guy who saw a zombie apocolypse happen and went "I bet I could set up a racket here"
[1:10:25] <Shishi1205> nuns
[1:10:25] <CamiHeart> He's got a GREAT deal on some new guns!
[1:10:26] <%Pesuto> No seriously, he just wants to sell you stuff and wants the valuables

[1:10:34] <%Aydarkzero> @OkamiDude15 hey wait a second...
[1:10:34] <%BioApple> the merchant is wesker, that's how he teleports everywhere psaLiz
[1:10:36] <%tiaramaki> Oh yeah, they looked like crap in the original, didn't they?
[1:10:38] <%jillvxlentine> i wish he was in re5
[1:10:39] <%SMuffinMan> I hate this song
[1:10:40] <+Pendragwn> @OkamiDude15 he realized that justice was kickass
[1:10:41] <BananaF4p> hes a zombie from res2 that survived the the nuke ... some how
[1:10:42] <%peachy996> tldr: Saddler corrupted Salazar
[1:10:44] <%Mister_McDerp> the illuminati
[1:10:46] <%rytisone> I like to think that there is no merchant and Leon is crazy

[1:10:47] <majindusto> CASTLE???
[1:10:47] <+Dingalow> "Art's stupid" - Pat Stares At
[1:11:01] <professorno> He’s like the happy Mask salesman, minor character that seems like he’s actually really important or something but it doesn’t matter
[1:11:12] <%AdamTheJaggi> i want the merchant to come back.
[1:11:19] <%doc_ock_rokc> so Colonialism was keeping the parasites back?
[1:11:23] <jinking79> He's Wesker

[1:36:10] <%Ranryu692> @tiaramaki no problem!
[1:36:16] <%doc_ock_rokc> That isn't untrue that is why they have those notifications at the end of the credits where it says "No animals were harmed
[1:36:17] <Edible_Enthusiasm> What about the new Dr Dolittle
[1:36:20] <@Moobot> I don't know if I can trust that. (@jillvxlentine) (warning)
[1:36:22] <Edible_Enthusiasm> aren't they all CGI animals
[1:36:23] <sweetbeanamin> do you think Hollywood dogs get picky with their puppachinos?
[1:36:26] <+professormorrigan> got em
[1:36:31] <%ElenaManetta> It's also sometimes for the human safety because they don't want a bear actor to attack the real humans because it was over stressed

[1:37:58] <+Doggyperro> Its pretty much the best game ever
[1:38:00] <%Jekado> they should make a RE4 - 2
[1:38:01] <+StrawberryPantsu> THEY DONT NEED TO
[1:38:03] <%Emperor_Machinus> @MSN04_Sazabi They been trying for a while. the process is slow. Must children don't survive the process
[1:38:04] <%ElenaManetta> On one hand, CG animals make a lot of work way easier and less stressful on both human and animal parties, on the other hand, I don't know if I like it.
[1:38:11] <+Drfunkenstein7> they will do it

[1:38:23] <%rumtumtugnutz> They should demake RE4
[1:38:23] <%SirGO0SE> I remember the day it came out just how revolutionary it was. It felt YEARS ahead of anything and was the best looking game in existence while being on the gamecube
[1:38:24] <%tiaramaki> It's fine the way it is, why ruin near-perfection?
[1:38:24] <+ConfusedEX> All 4 need is a graphical update
[1:38:25] <+StrawberryPantsu> RE4 has aged better than Dead Space 2...
[1:38:27] <+RenoDeGeneric> I wish the 2 remake was more arcade-y like 4. I want my ammo and treasure drops
[1:38:31] <%Jane_Lo> they won't? they'll just re-release on ps5
[1:38:31] <lloyddboy> but shiny new engine tho
[1:38:32] <%trekkie11041> maybe update controls
[1:38:35] <%rumtumtugnutz> Make evcerything crunchier
[1:38:36] <%Dragon_Batman> Yea, I agree

[2:49:15] <YaiGameworks> "Yes Lord Saddler, we'll make treasure chests pop up for those who sink our very expensive fire-breathing ships."
[2:49:16] <%doc_ock_rokc> This is why I like to think RE4 is a movie based on a story rather then a real re thing
[2:49:16] <%Laecerelius> YEAH!
[2:49:18] <%Floorislava> Hey that's me!
[2:49:18] <%PrinceSpacezero> This area sucks on the hardest difficulty

[2:49:29] <professorFess> did salazar have this lava imported?
[2:49:31] <%GarbageNirvana> lerd serdler
[2:49:33] <%NekoUrabe> Leon broke his neck there
[2:49:35] <+DrifterDMo> that was a sweet suplex holy shit
[2:49:38] <Spironito> where else are you gonna store your lava
[2:49:38] <mitochondriahousepower> At least they get sleeveless robes
[2:49:39] <Asuxley> I wonder why is there a chamber only with lava and there's no volcano in sight
[2:49:41] <CureMode666> give them a hug instead of a bullet
[2:49:41] <%StaceMcGate> But why?
[2:49:41] <DuoScratch> a item
[2:49:43] <+Juriasu> a noble purpose
[2:49:48] <+Double_Tap_That> Sounds about right
[2:49:50] <+Exyoh> In a world where corporate evil brought us Umbrella, aristocratic evil just doesn't stop
[2:49:50] <arkv01> would YOU fuck daddy Leon and risk retribution from the redfield dynasty
[2:49:51] <j0ustar> Supplexing a robed cultist in a lava room filled with treasure. Big B-movie right here

[2:49:57] <%Floorislava> psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead psaCrazyhand_HF
[2:49:59] <%Dragovus> Are you telling me you wouldn't have a lava room in your castle?
[2:50:00] <sniffy77> how do they prevent the lava from cooling? because this is a shitload of lava
[2:50:05] <%thackattack00> the function of the room is to protect the treasure at the end
[2:50:08] <%luftraumm1> iirc knocking the dragon turrets down stops them from spawning possibly reducing the ammount of loot
[2:50:10] <+envy_780> hey pat can you jump in the lava
[2:50:10] <kanesoban> Almost as dumb as the giant moving Salazar-robot
[2:50:12] <%linSP> this american shot me, im so sad lord saddler :( :( :(
[2:50:13] <%GeneralSCPatton> @patstaresat What contractor installed all this lava?
[2:50:14] <%ElenaManetta> It powers the mansion
[2:50:14] <kvassimoto> We out here making a run for the smelter demon
[2:50:15] <Owlrah_v2> This the fancy HD version or just the normal HD version
[2:50:18] <CureMode666> suplex them in the lava
[2:50:19] <+DrifterDMo> yeah jump in lava
[2:50:23] <%Flambage> Boss, Maybe you should install a bathroom for the soldiers instead of a "Lava Room"
[2:50:28] <+necrocannibal2> MATALO
[2:50:28] <%doc_ock_rokc> It probably was a last ditch effort to kill the plagas with the lava
[2:50:29] <%Laecerelius> Maybe fire grenade?
[2:50:29] <%Zerodyne90> hd mod
[2:50:30] <%SoFarFetched> should throw a gernade
[2:50:30] <%Ranryu692> use a grenade
[2:50:32] <%StaceMcGate> "Welcome to the cult, here is your medieval weapon"
[2:50:33] <%Jekado> fire nade?
[2:50:36] <shabop> Is this Iron Keep?
[2:50:38] <CureMode666> grenade time
[2:50:39] <%Zerodyne90> for the textures that is
[2:50:39] <+SlappyMeats> matalo means kill him :)
[2:50:40] <%KingKZ> Grenade
[2:50:40] <%vaporousTippler> He might need those grenades later.
[2:50:42] <%fruit_pie_the_magician> GRENADE
[2:50:43] <HealingMind> Every cult needs a 1-4 from super Mario Bros.
[2:50:45] <%Grayhammatter> throw one of those many fire nades
[2:50:48] <%Jekado> that guy go rekt
[2:50:48] <%natebud> He should buy the Mine Thrower
[2:50:50] <%SWFanatic> They're fire type, grenade wouldn't work
[2:50:50] <42nfl19> I thought you said you had to many fire nades @PatStaresAt
[2:50:51] <%Estuko> @StaceMcGate basically Metalocalypse
[2:50:53] <Owlrah_v2> Nice
[2:50:57] <+arcadiafan26> why is pat saving grenades?
[2:51:05] <bananrrr> those stairs would be so hot
[2:51:05] <%SWFanatic> because he might need them later
[2:51:06] <%ElenaManetta> to be fair you busted into THEIR lava room
[2:51:07] <Ahk_90> HOW ARE THOSE STAIRS NOT MELTED
[2:51:09] <NeroInfinite> YOu have like a million fire grenades @PatStaresAt
[2:51:11] <WaxWitch> what madman built this place?
[2:51:11] <+Juriasu> dragon fall down, stairs go up
[2:51:13] <professorFess> when I was a kid I wanted to be a singer, but that wasnt a realistic dream. that's how I got into selling convoluted castle traps to video game villains
[2:51:14] <%Flambage> @arcadiafan26 He might need them later
[2:51:14] <%peachy996> Don't even bother with Mine thrower until it's time to fuck around on the Island
[2:51:16] <%PanicSwytch> But the geographical location of village was nowhere near a volcano
[2:51:20] <krabsan> !uptime
[2:51:20] <+Ell1ot> it must take forever to reset the room
[2:51:20] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 51m.
[2:51:21] <%doc_ock_rokc> @arcadiafan26 Old habits die hard
[2:51:21] <%Ranryu692> Leon got the lion lol
[2:51:21] <%natebud> Good thing leon is so cool
[2:51:23] <+arcadiafan26> got it
[2:51:23] <+DrifterDMo> this whole room would be unbearable
[2:51:25] <+Saintsinhell24> Pat is a grenade hoarder
[2:51:25] <CursedNobleman> the room would bake you alive
[2:51:26] <Shishi1205> this is very unrealistic if this was Spain no one would speak english @PatStaresAt
[2:51:26] <%doc_ock_rokc> Them hot
[2:51:27] <bananrrr> melt leons feet hot
[2:51:27] <%rytisone> but Leon is cool so it's ok
[2:51:28] <j0ustar> and by hot they mean melted
[2:51:28] <%tiaramaki> How is Leon NOT sweating puddles? LUL
[2:51:28] <+Buttsong> its not lava its molten metal
[2:51:29] <+OwlLightningMage> Hot like a pocket
[2:51:29] <%hntronium> @arcadiafan26 So he can sell them when he needs space later
[2:51:29] <bananrrr> spicy
[2:51:30] <mobiusnightshade> Ah, the domain of the Old Iron King.
[2:51:32] <%Floorislava> psaCanada_RA
[2:51:32] <%Laecerelius> That's not lava! That's just really warm kool-aid!
[2:51:32] <+necrocannibal2> yeah, how did they bring this lava here
[2:51:33] <Spironito> pretty sure this room is at least 100c
[2:51:33] <%peachy996> Where does Salazar get the lava?
[2:51:35] <shabop> Where does Leon store that?
[2:51:36] <StromkoPenguin> Not to mention the air temperature and air quality in this room. It would be lethal.
[2:51:38] <%StaceMcGate> @Estuko they are least mixed it up with modern weaponry, these guys are a science based cult bent on world domination
[2:51:39] <+SlappyMeats> but Leon is hotter so he's ok pattyO
[2:51:42] <Oxybe> The knee slash is a man's greatest weak point
[2:51:43] <+Buttsong> its his molten iron pool room
[2:51:49] <%SWFanatic> good job patron
[2:51:49] <%Ipsenscastle> this room sucked
[2:51:51] <%Grayhammatter> as leon clips through the banister
[2:51:51] <%luftraumm1> cryP
[2:51:52] <%fruit_pie_the_magician> The air in this room would be hundreds of degrees and poisonous
[2:51:53] <CureMode666> JUMP JUMP JUMP SLIDE SLIDE SLIDE
[2:51:55] <Zaphire_Saucypants> it's built into a volcano somehow, shut up.
[2:51:57] <+OwlLightningMage> @peachy996 He gets it from Amazon
[2:51:57] <%ElenaManetta> have you ever lewded a staircase
[2:51:58] <RazHarvey> 130 c at least
[2:52:00] <+Double_Tap_That> How does that activate.
[2:52:04] <%TheSphereHunter> this game is stupid
[2:52:06] <%linSP> the reason leon stayed so cool in the lava room js because hes already hot psaDab
[2:52:07] <+OwlLightningMage> Amazon Lava
[2:52:12] <%Ranryu692> yeah, but he's Leon S. Kennedy
[2:52:13] <misterspotswood> leon is too cool tho
[2:52:14] <%Dr_Mooose> Leon tough tho
[2:52:16] <%natebud> Somehow the smartest RE game though
[2:52:16] <%tigerfang86> it's PRETTY COOL
[2:52:17] <bananrrr> it is pretty awesome
[2:52:17] <Valentinius_Anodyne> I dunno, seems pretty hot to me
[2:52:17] <%Grayhammatter> it looks like shit
[2:52:18] <%GeneralSCPatton> Not even environmental damage. Leon must have a +40 Fort Save.
[2:52:18] <%Estuko> @StaceMcGate I feel like a well placed drive-by via jets would just totally wipe this whole operation in 2 minutes.
[2:52:19] <+Ryaotz> heats the castle?
[2:52:21] <YaiGameworks> Plagas don't need to worry about poison, maybe
[2:52:22] <%tiaramaki> They just got all the pumps from Terraria and just pumped the lava from somewhere, it's fine
[2:52:25] <Spironito> it'd be toxic not poisonous
[2:52:29] <+Yellowrobe> The fact that this game doesn't give a fuck is why it is so good

[2:52:40] <KaliasTV> Ashley couldn't go with him because it was entirely hallucinated
[2:52:43] <YaiGameworks> Leon's hair sucks up the toxicity from the room, allowing him to purify the air around his face.
[2:52:44] <%Helmed> what sound does the chimera make ashley? LEEEEEEEEEOOOOOON
[2:52:45] <%Ipsenscastle> how do they have a weird lava room in a spanish castle?

[2:53:47] <%peachy996> @SWFanatic Salazar loves to have fun
[2:53:51] <%K2YP70C0CK> needs RE amusment park
[2:53:52] <MSN04_Sazabi> In fact, most evil people like having fun way too much
[2:53:53] <+OwlLightningMage> Evil people love theme parks
[2:53:53] <+OhioNitsud> you'd think they'd boobytrp the tram
[2:53:54] <%thackattack00> It's so Salazar's little baby legs dont get tired
[2:53:57] <mobiusnightshade> It's like Yzma's rollercoaster.

[3:26:26] <stabbityrabbit> Checkers makes a man smart. This just in from Patrick Boivin.
[3:26:26] <HealingMind> Pat, "goo goo ga ga" is an offensive stereotype to babies....
[3:26:27] <GameOver_Here> Then they Baby Nut all over the place, its soo salty.
[3:26:29] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Pat wants wood
[3:26:30] <Valentinius_Anodyne> If babies weren't such cowards they would just learn to talk
[3:26:32] <+Vantesla> The Chosen One baby would kick all our asses cryBaby
[3:26:33] <%ha2ken> Oh baby...you're the babiest baby that ever babied
[3:26:37] <OverzealousEuthanasiast> Babies are so selfish
[3:26:37] <$mooselooseinthehoose> Babies are terrible conversationalists
[3:26:40] <%toolofparanoia> THE OLLLLLE BABY NUT

[3:26:58] <+UrielCobalt> Pat is a big baby so he would know
[3:26:58] <%StaceMcGate> Babies are selfish, Pat is selfish. Therefore, Pat is a baby
[3:26:59] <+Remery_> Babies are always suckling the tits

[3:44:03] <%Zebroneath> Pat won
[3:44:04] <%thackattack00> You can do the same thing to Salazar
[3:44:04] <%toolofparanoia> I wish i would have known that
[3:44:05] <%Aydarkzero> @Sora20030c rocket kills every boss in one hit
[3:44:05] <%Sir_stride> Also theres a cheap way to kill Salazar as well
[3:44:05] <+OrphixPride> since they give you money for another RPG
[3:44:07] <%bigdumbidiotguy> fuck it hes a spookmaster
[3:44:08] <Oxybe> how long did he drag tht launcher for?
[3:44:08] <concretenj> @PatStaresAt what does he usually do if you don't have the rocket?
[3:44:11] <+tweedler92> Thats how I do Saddler every time LUL
[3:44:14] <HealingMind> Obviously you should have only used suplexes to kill the boss. psaDab
[3:44:14] <Doomstar16> Good work.

[3:44:35] <FrankysDream> @PatStaresAt i only just now realized that there are no item boxes in re4
[3:44:35] <%BallerSwagBro9k> He only takes big damage while chilled

[3:44:58] <%MoulesFritz> You can do the same trick with Salazar if you buy another RPG, Pat
[3:44:59] <+professormorrigan> krauser is fun

[3:45:32] <%StaceMcGate> I was about to yell at you LUL
[3:45:32] <%SolidusRex> Fun fact: Krauser has the same voice acter as Captain Qwark from the Ratchet & Clank games
[3:45:35] <%Aydarkzero> @Punisher7771 most likely at the podcast
[3:45:37] <%Sir_stride> and we dont know who he is because Darkside chronicles wasnt out then....I think
