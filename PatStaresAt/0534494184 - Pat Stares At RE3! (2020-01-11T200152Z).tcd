[0:18:44] <%deviljhojho_> gottem
[0:18:48] <%rumtumtugnutz> I thought the plot of Resident Evil was "Oh hey, Zombies! Fuck!"
[0:18:51] <%Garthunox> no pat that's the biohazard plot
[0:18:55] <%derekwst3> apatBlep apatWink apatElmo apatPorgmo apatGib
[0:18:56] <@SSaryn> Oh yeah that
[0:18:56] <%scaryboisupreme> Because terror doesn't have to end in "erist"
[0:19:06] <%Jekado> i backed up my saves right before starting
[0:19:07] <%salty_syd913> yeah thats what i though
[0:19:09] <%BallerSwagBro9k> ALso backup your saves manually
[0:19:12] <derap41> !uptime
[0:19:12] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Oof
[0:19:14] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 19m 15s.
[0:19:16] <%SoFarFetched> oh no
[0:19:16] <%deviljhojho_> tomatoDread
[0:19:17] <primaryfire> am I safe if I have already played a bit without it happening?

[0:19:33] <%Garthunox> gunlance
[0:19:34] <%Psyramics> whew, I just started today. glad I didn't get that
[0:19:35] <TheBlankAce> See guys the cloud is totally the future
[0:19:37] <shiny_prinny> i feel like this happens in more games than it should
[0:19:43] <%AncelDeLambert> and once again, Denuvo might just be FUCKING with you
[0:19:46] <@SSaryn> At least they found out the reason
[0:19:47] <tiaramaki> Yikes, I would just give up right then and there if I was in that situation
[0:19:47] <%HyperBomb21> Get fucked PC secondaries atpCap
[0:19:49] <artoflec> ill uh, wait til they iron out some shit before i pick up MHW on PC
[0:19:56] <%AncelDeLambert> because the industry still uses Denuvo for some reason
[0:20:00] <%rumtumtugnutz> The cloud is the future. People just have to implement it better.
[0:20:10] <%cvp5127> you and everyone else
[0:20:12] <%LtSurge> well that's one way to reward every day players
[0:20:16] <primaryfire> mhw was ironed out a long time ago, iceborne is just a bit unoptimised
[0:20:17] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Good luck preventing your Switch getting stolen at work
[0:20:26] <DestroPrime83> didnt lose my character but imma wait for this to blow over just in case
[0:20:27] <NaturalGear> Creative Assembly seem to be the only ones to have figured out how to use cloud saves correctly
[0:20:31] <muniea3> but we'll all be dead by the time cyberpunk comes out
[0:20:33] <Daxalog> Whats your backup plan game incase Cyberpunk is bad or boring?
[0:20:36] <jrglz90> es ist so schön wieder hier zu sein

[0:24:05] <%scaryboisupreme> but here's some shade
[0:24:07] <%ElenaManetta> Sometimes I spend hours organizing stuff in video games and I could never be a streamer.
[0:24:07] <BettyMwwaahh> Pat likes to be in control
[0:24:07] <cochramd1992> @ImaPlayThis why not? I'll bet the reasons for changing your appearance will be the same in both.
[0:24:11] <%jillvxlentine> i feel like i need to impress the other person otherwise lol
[0:24:12] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> same way. Unless it's coop. I do enjoy coop.

[0:25:06] <chainedwolfstress> That's his poop screm.
[0:25:08] <%ElenaManetta> I'm 100% convinced Sword and Shield made BAD AI players for the Raid battles to encourage you to buy online services.
[0:25:08] <ImaPlayThis> @cochramd1992 no, the two aren't comparable at all, like in any capacity, if the characters in the game reacted to you like irl then maybe there can be argument but as it stands no
[0:25:09] <cureneckbeard> he scared the ghost cat away. well done elmo
[0:25:09] <theKingRamses> paw is haunted

[0:26:43] <%ElenaManetta> There's a scene in Louie where he walks into a deli and sees a cat and just spends a minute meowing and it makes me laugh everytime.
[0:26:44] <CrimsonGargoyle> i do that constantly LUL
[0:26:45] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> I often get a meow back
[0:26:47] <%Desertfishing> do that to kids who are crying
[0:26:49] <tiaramaki> Yeah, that sounds about right LUL
[0:26:51] <%Schrodingers_Box> Stop copying me, It works on children too
[0:26:52] <UncleOliver> I do the exact same shit to my dog to rile him up more
[0:26:56] <Das_Beergut> Also; right after your cat licks you, lick them back to confuse them.
[0:26:57] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> with more intensity
[0:27:03] <muniea3> it's like when Paige repeats what you say right back
[0:27:08] <%jimmypurple> @angriestpat i harmonize with my cats yells
[0:27:09] <%BallerSwagBro9k> FUCK YOU ITS FOREVER
[0:27:13] <PeteyMcPickle> You will not stream all of these things it is impossible

[0:27:26] <cochramd1992> @ImaPlayThis nah, even San Andreas had your outfit affect gameplay and how NPCs react to you, so we can expect something as advanced as 2077 to do so
[0:27:26] <%Zerodyne90> thanks @MoonObscure for the gift sub apatDab
[0:27:37] <cureneckbeard> links in the dooblydoo

[0:28:06] <ELJOVENBATALI> i feel like pat is a cacodemon in a human form
[0:28:09] <%jillvxlentine> so was last year in my opinion
[0:28:10] <+MellowYellowFellow> beards looking fresh mate
[0:28:12] <ImaPlayThis> @cochramd1992 but gta san andreas was third person, you could see the differences, whereas in 2077 you can't... I just find it really funny that the devs focuse on something you'll never see so much
[0:28:20] <%LtSurge> What was the worst year for games?
[0:28:25] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Like....literally?
[0:28:29] <%Puhff> You wait on people to shit on you?

[0:30:28] <%EliGrumble> I think its 'frowned upon' but everyone does it
[0:30:30] <laserbeaming> It's technically legal, so no one will do anything I think
[0:30:32] <%Truniron> How far into the game is Pat?
[0:30:33] <%Caped_Eggy> You gotta listen to it everytime tho
[0:30:34] <+TheOneCalledRock> hey pat, hey chat. how is everyone doing today

[0:31:36] <spongeofmystery> Shoutout to the guy who streamed an MMA fight reflected in his glasses
[0:31:38] <%LtSurge> Artifact is the best way to watch wrestlemania
[0:31:38] <%FacetiousAF> stinky nerd chat and pat

[0:31:45] <MoonObscure> HLL YEA
[0:31:50] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> thinking of jumping ship over to Porn Hub?
[0:31:50] <CrimsonGargoyle> BEST TIMELINE
[0:31:51] <%Jekado> watch it be more civil
[0:31:51] <%AnthroMetal> AnthroMetal subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months, currently on a 5 month streak! 
[0:31:51] <$Afterman_> pat would slut it up for pornhub
[0:31:53] <oyyzzo> that was the best
[0:31:54] <%JJCheeker> Eventually it will all turn into one website
[0:31:54] <%BallerSwagBro9k> SO?
[0:31:55] <ImaPlayThis> So when's the RE speedruns using your feet
[0:31:56] <CrimsonGargoyle> you can show bepis
[0:31:57] <cureneckbeard> You could show feet
[0:31:57] <muniea3> when youtube bans videos or something stupid
[0:31:58] <%antshadow14> so pornhub will play guys game
[0:31:58] <rytisone> Pornhub will own everything in the future
[0:31:59] <Prevot> that would be awesome
[0:31:59] <%BallerSwagBro9k> ITS A WIN WIN
[0:31:59] <%terminallyCapriciousz> big porns all around pat
[0:32:03] <%Jekado> how is that different from now
[0:32:04] <%jillvxlentine> watching a stream with bouncing titties up the top

[0:32:11] <%cvp5127> its a bonus
[0:32:11] <theKingRamses> you'd need an extra cam for the energy drink that rests on your dick
[0:32:11] <%goose_attack_almanac> Pornhub and Paypal don't work together aymore
[0:32:12] <%legendscar01> Faith

[0:32:19] <%TomDanksEGOT> pop your shirt off
[0:32:20] <%EliGrumble> it would be the same except you could definitely get your dick out
[0:32:20] <+ElarusTheMage> Pat, or porn... "Hard" Choice.

[0:32:23] <+Mottyrob> just fuck Paige live
[0:32:24] <Dragovus> @AngriestPat that's what multi monitors are for
[0:32:25] <Fujiwara_92> what's the downside? we just watch both at the same time
[0:32:26] <%AnthroMetal> Time to get an onlyfans Pat
[0:32:26] <$Afterman_> insert people crying about "titty streamer"
[0:32:26] <%spoonbruh> Jill hentai
[0:32:26] <%Tracazoid> You'll be the perfect thing to watch AFTER their five minutes on the rest of the site.
[0:32:27] <%NovaKnightmare> that feels facetious
[0:32:29] <Angry_Ev1L> barely a difference
[0:32:32] <CrimsonGargoyle> you know the wholesome guy on pornhub pat? works the exact same way! people CHOOSE to watch him
[0:32:33] <%Jekado> you don't know what twitch ads are coming up right now

[0:32:36] <artoflec> just have porn on the side all the time anyway
[0:32:37] <UncleOliver> short redhead gets donkey punched by nemesis
[0:32:38] <cureneckbeard> We'd watch Pat in between pornography
[0:32:40] <lindy94> ANGRIESTFAP
[0:32:44] <Karakuioshi> Ginger and dwarf girls
[0:32:45] <cochramd1992> and you have to open your incognito tab too
[0:32:47] <cvp5127> f that

[0:32:51] <+PanicSwytch> What if I have porn and your stream at the same time
[0:32:52] <ThDark> That's not new with Paypal
[0:32:52] <%Schrodingers_Box> They tried, There are tons of alternatives to Paypal.
[0:32:52] <FalseEyeD> PAYPAL IS NOT A BANK
[0:32:54] <jetboots> one monitor for porn and one for pat
[0:32:54] <ELJOVENBATALI> what if im already jerking off watching this stream
[0:32:55] <+greyfox747> what did I just walk into
[0:32:56] <CrimsonGargoyle> paypal is where it is BECAUSE of sex workers LUL
[0:32:58] <%StoicMoogle> you gotta show a bit of that butthole
[0:32:59] <%doc_ock_rokc> DID I MISS IT?!
[0:32:59] <%Desertfishing> no more titty streams from pat
[0:33:00] <%Schrodingers_Box> So people just move to a diffrent service
[0:33:01] <%SoFarFetched> ITS DIRTY
[0:33:03] <Daxalog> Also Patreon as well.
[0:33:03] <Das_Beergut> @lindy94 Whatever's your stress reliever
[0:33:06] <laserbeaming> clicks on Pat, but is disappointed no Pornography was shown
[0:33:08] <theKingRamses> the banks were afraid of losing their business to porn banks
[0:33:08] <MartiusGW> maybe its taxes?
[0:33:09] <%hntronium> no fun allowed
[0:33:10] <%Jekado> dirty cyber money
[0:33:11] <%tyler274> because if they fund child porn its a giant headache
[0:33:13] <muniea3> palpal was also responsible for the patreon crackdown
[0:33:14] <shiny_prinny> is that a real thing
[0:33:14] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Porn and Anime will save the world
[0:33:15] <%Jekado> gotta wash your computer afterwards
[0:33:16] <%jillvxlentine> exactly, its really bad for sex workers
[0:33:19] <Prevot> paypal have been a bunch of assholes for a long time
[0:33:20] <%thegreatbambe> pp is big Christians
[0:33:20] <%skeletor42069> people have said that for years. porn artists are going to be fine
[0:33:20] <+theotherkristian> banks NEED to know you're buying porn
[0:33:21] <StingtheKing> The Children (TM)
[0:33:21] <cochramd1992> as long as it's legal, why complain?
[0:33:22] <ELJOVENBATALI> what a bunch of cowards
[0:33:22] <+BoboDaHobo> private companies have too much control over money
[0:33:23] <brows_> Ah yes, the pornhub equivalent of twitch, twatch.
[0:33:24] <MartiusGW> i am not sure if porn can be taxed
[0:33:24] <laserbeaming> @shiny_prinny it is!
[0:33:25] <%SoFarFetched> Think it's cause they just don't want to be known as a platform for pornography foor whatever reason LUL
[0:33:26] <%antshadow14> pron and vore
[0:33:28] <%legendscar01> sweaty money

[0:33:42] <FalseEyeD> This is clearly a tentacle stream
[0:33:42] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat It was because churches for a long time banked with them and would pull out their money if you went against their ideals
[0:33:42] <+chase959> if ppl planted trees the way the bust nuts the world would be saved in a week
[0:33:42] <Cubblesv2> Imagine going on Pornhub and finding Pat sat squarely between the titties and the hentai

[0:37:06] <detritus25> Run pat run. Like The Goblin Champ you ar.
[0:37:13] <DestroPrime83> is this the game with aweful voice acting or was that RE 1
[0:37:18] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Pretyy much
[0:37:21] <Prevot> even if you do
[0:37:23] <+chaumiester> So Wesker is still alive?
[0:37:24] <%doc_ock_rokc> Except Marv
[0:37:25] <%NovaKnightmare> that applies to most media tbf
[0:37:25] <%FacetiousAF> how many more nemesis kills do you need?
[0:37:26] <AfroKing24> wesker is fine :)
[0:37:28] <%Schrodingers_Box> @AngriestPat What about Wesker? He got skewered on screen?
[0:37:28] <thetruenicster> Basically, it goes by Yakuza Rules
[0:37:28] <%jillvxlentine> all 3 main re games had bad voice acting
[0:37:29] <primaryfire> in some cases even if they graphically die on screen
[0:37:30] <%BioHunter> except ada
[0:37:30] <Press_X_ToJASON> only the harshest of cutscene deaths count
[0:37:35] <FalseEyeD> doodWesker Wesker Even Dies Onscreen
[0:37:35] <djazo> IT.S THE RULE OF EVERYTHING PAT
[0:37:36] <kazadog> @DestroPrime83 its kinda all of the early ones but mostly 1
[0:37:37] <cureneckbeard> apatHoldon_HF
[0:37:37] <%BioHunter> she's always fine
[0:37:37] <majima666> mekyle!!!
[0:37:37] <%Truniron> Isn't that the common media rule? Unless you see them die, they are not dead
[0:37:39] <%FirearmsInstructor> !uptime
[0:37:40] <+kikanshat0masu> Even then pat
[0:37:40] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 37m 42s.
[0:37:44] <%Zerodyne90> there is one death here that you dont see, but the body does look pretty dead
[0:37:44] <%happyface699> Like richard
[0:37:49] <%FacetiousAF> PogChamp
[0:37:51] <laserbeaming> I now wonder what's Carlos' voice is gonna be like in the Remake

[0:37:54] <+kikanshat0masu> Weaker is probably still alive
[0:37:54] <%takokasa> close one
[0:37:56] <%Darren716> LUL
[0:37:56] <Riddlesmith> What is the ranking of this game among the resident evil series?
[0:37:57] <cochramd1992> @chaumiester I think "trapped in magma" counts as "killed graphically on screen"
[0:37:59] <Press_X_ToJASON> PogChamp
[0:38:00] <Das_Beergut> Pat, just remember, to 900 people, you're more entertaining than AGDQ.

[0:39:54] <axivate_> Legit thought I had forgot to close my porn tab LUL
[0:39:54] <detritus25> CARLOS DIDN'T DIE ONSCREEN.
[0:39:54] <%Jane_Lo> @Riddlesmith it's a few weeks after re1 -> re3 stats -> during re3 whole re2 happens -> re3 ends with a distruction of raccoon city

[0:40:15] <Rayorin> lol

[0:40:27] <Riddlesmith> @Jane_Lo Thank you VoHiYo
[0:40:30] <%jillvxlentine> i think it makes the game a little harder
[0:40:32] <%rufus2k2> YOINKS AND AWAY
[0:40:34] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat If Jill jumps out of the window, she will enter the clock tower through the back door, Carlos will give to Jill some freeze rounds for the Grenade Launcher in the main hall, and the fight with Nemesis after the clock tower bell is rung sees him fully armed with his Rocket Launcher.
[0:40:39] <Dragovus> @AngriestPat change your weapon
[0:40:41] <%ElenaManetta> RE music is so overwhelming
[0:40:48] <%takiyami> Wait, so the benefit is that Carlos becomes less Dere Dere and more Tsun Tsun?
[0:40:49] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat If Jill uses the emergency brake she will enter the tower from the front courtyard. Carlos will not give Jill ammo, but will appear at the start of the Nemesis fight and destroy his rocket launcher before being knocked out, making Nemesis unable to use it.
[0:40:59] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> man RE sure does have an obsession with Chess, don't it?
[0:41:03] <%Jane_Lo> @Riddlesmith bawkLove
[0:41:04] <detritus25> RE3: The Backdowning
[0:41:04] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat If either decision isn't chosen, the cable car will crash and Jill will be flung into the clock tower front courtyard, suffering damage from the crash. The story will play out as if Jill used the emergency brake.
[0:41:05] <%jillvxlentine> oh nice, thanks for explaining
[0:41:07] <Das_Beergut> Pat's Game Done Quick
[0:41:12] <%spoonbruh> Shoulda breaked
[0:41:16] <%spoonbruh> Sadness
[0:41:26] <SocialMisfitGamer> so freeze rounds or no rockets for nemesis

[0:41:33] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 41m 34s.
[0:41:35] <%Jane_Lo> Wow, I didn't knew there was option for not doing anything???
[0:41:36] <kazadog> let nemesis have his rockets
[0:41:39] <Rayorin> Carlos will no longer let jill sniff his spicy Latin butthole
[0:41:42] <kazadog> he gets bodied hard enough as is
[0:41:42] <%Truniron> Really cool to see that the options acctually changes the gameplay in different ways
[0:41:49] <cureneckbeard> nemesis can have a little rockets as a treat
[0:41:50] <%CommanderSqueaks> @rayorin Why
[0:41:51] <%jillvxlentine> if you leave the decision too long it chooses for you
[0:41:57] <FalseEyeD> E l m o
[0:42:04] <Rayorin> because she abandoned him
[0:42:12] <Rayorin> i thought that was clear

[0:43:07] <%jillvxlentine> IVE NEVER SEEN THIS
[0:43:09] <%dukenux> That's relatable
[0:43:10] <%FacetiousAF> and carlos... WON'T betray you??
[0:43:11] <%rufus2k2> money don't grow on trees~
[0:43:11] <theKingRamses> don't buy it, he's a zombie, shoot carlos
[0:43:15] <%dukenux> PogChamp
[0:43:16] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> you're so wicked Carlos
[0:43:18] <+amiroodude> No rest for the wicked
[0:43:24] <+kikanshat0masu> Carlos Mensia
[0:43:25] <%Movemeister> Take a look at THIS
[0:43:28] <$crown_clown22> Wassup Pat
[0:43:30] <Prevot> wonder if carlos and jill will give each other fuck eyes in the remake, like claire and leon
[0:43:31] <Ace_Flibble> Do freeze rounds ever come back? I don't remember them in any other game.
[0:43:38] <%doc_ock_rokc> There aint no rest for the wicked
[0:43:40] <the_millenial_falcon> i h8 that puzzle so much
[0:43:43] <%FacetiousAF> carlos: i heard you want to kill nemesis, let me help
[0:43:47] <%dukenux> That looks like enough freeze rounds to last you for the rest of the game
[0:43:50] <%bluebiscuit94> !uptime
[0:43:51] <%jillvxlentine> carlos looks hot as fuck in the remake
[0:43:52] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 43m 53s.
[0:43:52] <%doc_ock_rokc> Chronos
[0:43:53] <Mishal21S> Too bad this music plays once

[0:43:57] <Rayorin> @angriestpat you lost access to Carlos' sweet Latin heat
[0:43:59] <%legendscar01> Kratos

[0:44:21] <detritus25> WHEN'S DMC2 PAT?
[0:44:24] <Das_Beergut> If you pull the emergency brake Carlos will borrow Jill's Walkman and later swear the he returned it already. Until Jill's birthday, where he "buys" her a Walkman with no box and the same Rush tape already in it.
[0:44:24] <%jillvxlentine> apparently, ive never used it
[0:44:26] <%Jekado> is a mine thrower a real gun i don't believe that
[0:44:36] <%FirearmsInstructor> OOF

[0:45:46] <tiaramaki> Wait, I saw a tub of Blue Herbs. Are there -any- poison enemies at this point?
[0:45:47] <%happyface699> So those are pointless
[0:45:47] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat It's not a difficult puzzle LUL "Does it sound shit? Flip switch"
[0:45:51] <%dukenux> Pat masters another RE game by accident
[0:45:52] <Mishal21S> There is another one by the stairs
[0:45:54] <Ranger747> !uptime
[0:45:55] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 45m 56s.
[0:46:00] <%ajgilmore1> After this are you playing RE4 or CV?
[0:46:02] <%FacetiousAF> !sluttime
[0:46:02] <%JJCheeker> I only found it because the first time I have played I read a guide
[0:46:04] <FalseEyeD> Nearly all the puzzles can be brute forced in this game
[0:46:09] <%SoFarFetched> he's doing CV after
[0:46:09] <clown_shoes> wait, did he forgot to change the overlay?
[0:46:10] <%dukenux> CV iirc
[0:46:10] <%mistersups> mistersups subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months! Grad School semester 2. Getting started on what you could call my thesis. Pray for me.`
[0:46:10] <%jillvxlentine> i would say maybe its for deaf people but this game doesnt even have subtitles

[0:46:26] <%Rngiddion> videogames
[0:46:30] <theKingRamses> @ajgilmore1 he's playing whatever was released first
[0:46:31] <FalseEyeD> @clown_shoes Is it supposed to be something else?
[0:46:34] <%Birdigalore> Birdigalore subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months! Quick question my dood. Can I start the Witcher series at 2 or am I hurting myself by not playing the eurojank Witcher 1?
[0:46:36] <%happyface699> He’s. Sneaky
[0:46:39] <%godzookylives> He's just a little shy is all
[0:46:40] <KaliasTV> time has come for ghost zombie
[0:46:45] <ospreyworks> @ajgilmore1 both, he’s playing all of them minus the gun survivor games and the chronicles games
[0:46:45] <%EliGrumble> is the order CV, remake then zero?
[0:46:47] <cochramd1992> gee it's almost as if the camera is the real obstacle to overcome in this game Kappa
[0:46:52] <lindy94> It's only smells
[0:46:56] <%happyface699> @godzookylives Hes a little insecure
[0:46:57] <FalseEyeD> smellz
[0:46:58] <%doc_ock_rokc> @KaliasTV ZOMBIE GHOST LEAVE THIS PLACE!
[0:46:58] <%jillvxlentine> i started the witcher 3 and had really no trouble
[0:47:04] <Renuarb> I can't wait for REmake to get another Remake
[0:47:06] <lindy94> It's nothing
[0:47:09] <%FirearmsInstructor> foy-YAY
[0:47:10] <%rufus2k2> the FOIVIN
[0:47:10] <ospreyworks> CVX most likely
[0:47:11] <NaturalGear> he's playing everything in release order I believe
[0:47:14] <%FacetiousAF> 4yay
[0:47:17] <majima666> gun survivor remake
[0:47:19] <%terminallyCapriciousz> @ospreyworks he's changed it so completion of the marathon is only 1, 2, 3, CVX, and 4, doing others if there's extra time
[0:47:20] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Coward
[0:47:20] <TheDiddlerz> I'd recommend playing all three of them, but start at 2 at the very least
[0:47:20] <%rufus2k2> doggos
[0:47:20] <lindy94> Only Smellz
[0:47:25] <clown_shoes> @FalseEyeD the dimensions aren't right, he did previous streams with more squarer one
[0:47:27] <+creamandsugar> ah man no gun survivor games? We gonna miss "the solution to dying from t virus is to inject yourself with g virus and become a woman?"
[0:47:28] <majima666> expanded ark thompson lore
[0:47:32] <%dukenux> I started with 1, but so many people started with 3 and loved it, i can't see it being an obstacle
[0:47:32] <Fujiwara_92> coward
[0:47:33] <%EliGrumble> man Survivor is so fucking bad
[0:47:36] <link118> How much have i missed?
[0:47:43] <majima666> "Im ViNcEnT!?"
[0:47:46] <%Jane_Lo> @Birdigalore witcher 2 is good, but like, witcher 3 is there all the juice starts
[0:47:46] <daisyyyy> Nah whens RE4 remake? Kappa
[0:47:55] <%jillvxlentine> just got to the clock tower, like 50 minutes

[0:48:24] <%doc_ock_rokc> So are you bummed that the RE3make might not have decisions and only one ending?
[0:48:24] <FalseEyeD> @clown_shoes Oh yeah, this is a different Overlay

[0:48:31] <+albedo455> pat doing vince
[0:48:32] <tiaramaki> At least you got the chance to go back
[0:48:33] <CybertronPrime> When's Resident Evil: Dead Aim Remake?
[0:48:36] <rytisone> RE4 does not need a remake. what would you even improve?

[0:50:12] <%Jekado> spoders
[0:50:12] <Fujiwara_92> STAIRS
[0:50:13] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Probably just the wind. Don't worry about it.
[0:50:15] <tiaramaki> Oh, I guess that answered my question about poison enemies
[0:50:17] <%rufus2k2> fuck outta here spiders
[0:50:18] <kazadog> these fucking spiders are so dumb
[0:50:18] <+ZephynM> I hope there are spoders in the RE3 Remake.
[0:50:19] <%dukenux> sure is arachnophobic in here
[0:50:20] <AEUG_Ace_Kamille> HOLY FUCK THOSE SPIDERS
[0:50:27] <%happyface699> @jillvxlentine It took about 2 hrs for me
[0:50:28] <%doc_ock_rokc> @dukenux It could be a reference to marathon where spinning the shotgun reloads it
[0:50:31] <%0oki> 0oki subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 1 month streak! 
[0:50:31] <Ace_Flibble> I hope one of the remakes finally makes spiders worth a damn
[0:50:32] <%Jane_Lo> @jillvxlentine oh god, i fucked up my cvx game by the same thing gldfjlkgjdfgdf
[0:50:32] <%BallerSwagBro9k> We know
[0:50:33] <majima666> yeah, kinda bummed they had no spiders in the re2 remake
[0:50:34] <%spoonbruh> Resident evil is probably the reason I have arachnophobia

[0:54:58] <TheDiddlerz> If Nemesis attacks, I'll eat my food
[0:54:59] <rytisone> You would have to fry his ass or something
[0:55:01] <Rayorin> it's like we're playing chrono trigger
[0:55:03] <FalseEyeD> But that would never happen, because of the implication
[0:55:04] <%SoFarFetched> Do you get anything from this nemesis or its just a you have to fight him?

[0:59:35] <%dukenux> THis is how it is in this bitch of a city
[0:59:36] <Ace_Flibble> Resident Evil is a world where everyone is the Riddler. And never bones.
[0:59:36] <Prevot> of course a place named after racoons would be full of nutjobs
[0:59:37] <BradVickers> The water puzzle is the best puzzle in the game.
[0:59:37] <xanderfist> it's a puzzle city
[0:59:38] <laserbeaming> I'm sure there was an Architectural Fad for puzzles
[0:59:38] <Fujiwara_92> racoon city is the hometown of professor Layton, didn't you know Kappa

[0:59:42] <Mr_Strut> Raccoon City was an Umbrella experiment in a society that solves all conflict through puzzles.

[0:59:58] <%arcaderabbit48> @commanderclaw I would drive to the next city over and go to their DMV, than deal with that. The DMV is already a puzzle infested, tedious mess!
[0:59:59] <Dragovus> There where blue herbs on the other side of the main hall
[1:00:00] <Das_Beergut> Is she bunny-hopping up the stairs? Cuz that'd be adorable.
[1:00:01] <%Cozy90> The best puzzle in the game is whatever one Pat fails the most at.
[1:00:06] <BurdRightsActivist> @cochramd1992 Water temple wasn't so bad tho
[1:00:07] <%doc_ock_rokc> @ospreyworks ...wow that would rock
[1:00:13] <+elbishop> Plot twist, all of resident evil plot is an excuse for a mad man to test his twisted puzzles.

[1:00:30] <+ConLin_Arts_> in RE7 was it implied that Lucas made all the puzzles or something?

[1:05:35] <+chaumiester> But... he's got all those pockets on his pants and vest... why can't he carry more stuff?
[1:05:37] <They_Call_Me_The_Fizz> How nice of the zombies to avoid munching on Jill while Carlos is away...
[1:05:39] <$insaneintentionsyo> bawkAy
[1:05:39] <UncleOliver> less than a day before the army dabs on raccoon city

[1:05:41] <%JJCheeker> Chris is not in 3
[1:05:43] <+pectusumbra> This is supposed to be a safe place Carlos?!
[1:05:45] <%arcaderabbit48> @AngriestPat So are you going to do a Carlo A/Jill B playthrough after this?
[1:05:46] <%dukenux> Then he jerked more vigorously
[1:05:49] <%SolidusRex> Choke jerking it
[1:05:50] <+ConLin_Arts_> has Carlos been in any ohter game?
[1:05:50] <laserbeaming> Carlos was pulling a Shinji?
[1:05:52] <$insaneintentionsyo> yolo Carlos bawkGlad
[1:05:55] <Rayorin> he was spicing up his butthole
[1:05:56] <majima666> smokin dat green erb like "awww sheet, deez cabrons threw me in the deep end this time"
[1:05:57] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Do you know about the different endings with the helicopter?
[1:05:58] <+Pecker_Wizard> PAT TIME!
[1:05:59] <FalseEyeD> Bad Luck
[1:05:59] <coracor> upgraded spiders
[1:06:02] <%doc_ock_rokc> @chaumiester maybe he used the rest of his ammo while jill was KOed?
[1:06:02] <%godzookylives> He was Choke Jerking
[1:06:07] <rytisone> big strong man
[1:06:10] <NaturalGear> of course he doesn't get any more ammo, he already has 100% of them
[1:06:10] <FalseEyeD> That is best as a spider hallway
[1:06:10] <%Jekado> big stronk

[1:06:23] <Das_Beergut> @Jekado Eh, medium stronc
[1:06:27] <%rufus2k2> i bet in r3make jill will move it no probs
[1:06:35] <%ledgefiendd> what if every RE game had the Zapping System
[1:06:36] <+trekkie11041> @Cozy90 if pat had hit the ebrake carlos would have shown up at the beginning of the nemesis fight and destroyed he rocket launcher
[1:06:37] <%ledgefiendd> ?
[1:06:37] <%JJCheeker> I like that it's raining
[1:06:38] <They_Call_Me_The_Fizz> Mmmm... That's good ludonarrative sexism...

[1:07:09] <%Schrodingers_Box> @AngriestPat Will RE3 Remake be longer given they won't extend gameplay with two characters A/B routes?. Also what do you think about the What If Stories from RE2 being added into RE3?
[1:07:11] <%Cozy90> @trekkie11041 oh!
[1:07:11] <%VashyronM> Now Carlos has liver disease

[1:07:27] <FalseEyeD> *old man sounds*
[1:07:29] <%dukenux> Carlos' like "eh"
[1:07:29] <AfricanizedBees> Don't forget to set your rifle to burst fire to squeeze more damage out of it.
[1:07:30] <%rufus2k2> OH FUCK
[1:07:30] <coracor> D:
[1:07:31] <%thevillainus> oh shit!
[1:07:33] <+ConLin_Arts_> WutFace WutFace

[1:07:42] <+ConLin_Arts_> A hontah most hont
[1:07:43] <tiaramaki> "We gotta get you to a hospital," Leon said. "Someone's gotta help you," he said.
[1:07:48] <Dragovus> It's the Hunter from Hunter X Hunter
[1:07:49] <%arcaderabbit48> MMMM, those Hunters seem a touch overdone
[1:07:49] <%Jekado> @Das_Beergut no chris is biggest stronk
[1:07:53] <xanderfist> the worst monster
[1:07:56] <%FirearmsInstructor> #NailedIt
[1:07:57] <%ClaudeMcGarren> his butthole is too spicy
[1:07:58] <FalseEyeD> @Birdigalore *drums table*
[1:07:59] <%SolidusRex> Hunter x Tekken
[1:08:01] <the_millenial_falcon> carlos is stronk but he can't punch boulder
[1:08:03] <neutral_guy> You know a hospital has to be one of the WORST place to go to in a zombie outbreak
[1:08:08] <%ledgefiendd> is Resident Evil the Dark Souls of horror games? Kappa
[1:08:11] <%Chocolatevgz> The sound of Carlos' ass cheeks clapping, etc.
[1:08:12] <%thevillainus> ait i'mma go watch the first part on yt
[1:08:15] <majima666> hospital seems like one of the WORST places to go in a zombie outbreak lol
[1:08:17] <+ConLin_Arts_> Chris PUNCHES a boulder
[1:08:22] <NaturalGear> a hunter is a hunter, even in a sequel
[1:08:26] <%spoonbruh> @neutral_guy well yeah ever seen dawn of the dead
[1:08:34] <FalseEyeD> A hunter must hunt
[1:08:36] <CrimsonGargoyle> BUT WHAT IF THO
[1:08:38] <majima666> because umbrella
[1:08:39] <%Chocolatevgz> but its an umbrella hospital maybe
[1:08:40] <$insaneintentionsyo> Japan
[1:08:41] <%JJCheeker> Maybe they were owned by umbrella
[1:08:43] <%dukenux> As we know, drugs are invented at hospitals
[1:08:44] <rickyjones47> Maybe though
[1:08:45] <rytisone> and University as well
[1:08:46] <%Chocolatevgz> also I guess umbrella has hospitals now
[1:08:47] <Lunarmight> ResidentSleeper
[1:08:48] <+ConLin_Arts_> and that a cure would be found like 1h after the outbreak
[1:08:54] <Ipsenscastle> drinking monsters
[1:08:55] <%xeros720> getting spicy in here
[1:08:55] <%happyface699> A cure ooh
[1:08:55] <+pectusumbra> I mean at least in this case we have a whole conspiracy thing going on with Umbrella
[1:08:56] <castlerock42> Maybe the T Virus really isn't that complicated to cure.
[1:08:59] <%ElenaManetta> Funny, that diary entry was written BEFORE the virus
[1:09:03] <FalseEyeD> Hospital in Raccoon City = Umbrella
[1:09:05] <%Jekado> why does a hospital locker have bullets?
[1:09:07] <%jillvxlentine> yeah but they had the t virus long before the outbreak right?
[1:09:10] <AfricanizedBees> Note that zombies have been a thing in town for WEEKS according to that file.
[1:09:12] <djazo> @angriestpat can you explain why zombie biting you.r neck doesn't turn you into one
[1:09:16] <Das_Beergut> @Chocolatevgz Carlos "dummy thicc" Oliveira
[1:09:18] <neutral_guy> Imagine telling everyone in the city "BTW the cure is in this hospital come get it" shit would go crazy fast
[1:09:19] <%happyface699> Eat my monsters zombies
[1:09:19] <%spoonbruh> If this happened today you just know trump would hit thar red button
[1:09:20] <%jillvxlentine> so it makes sense for there to be a cure
[1:09:22] <%Schrodingers_Box> Personally, Id go to the local package sorting warehouse. Barely anyone there, tons of veichles, chance of random items, and the entire place is surrounded by a fence/security gate.
[1:09:30] <UncleOliver> @AngriestPat counterpoint, umbrella would 100% do heinous shit in a hospital
[1:09:32] <FalseEyeD> Midwest keeps bullets everywhere
[1:09:33] <%VashyronM> Cause their big heroes
[1:09:34] <%thevillainus> that's so dumb i love it
[1:09:34] <rytisone> it's a ameplay feature
[1:09:35] <tiaramaki> Outbreak 1 and 2 remakes when
[1:09:37] <CrazyMedicine> and Leon
[1:09:39] <Ace_Flibble> Don't forget Steve!
[1:09:40] <%BioHunter> and sherry
[1:09:40] <%ledgefiendd> when you get bit, you're breaking canon
[1:09:40] <+ConLin_Arts_> git gud pat and do canon way
[1:09:42] <%FacetiousAF> and then jill gets a big beefy arm
[1:09:46] <%Jekado> ORC remake when?
[1:09:47] <oniwahoo> Sherry also
[1:09:48] <cochramd1992> Canon is a perfect no-damage 100% playthrough
[1:09:49] <Ipsenscastle> seems weird that they made the zambos default attck animation them chewing on your jugular
[1:09:49] <tiaramaki> Like that virus/infection mechanic was pretty neato
[1:09:49] <Ace_Flibble> Actually, always forget Steve.
[1:09:50] <Daxalog> Canonically Snake never got caught and played on European Extreme I guess
[1:09:51] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat ALSO majority of the RE cast is T resistant
[1:09:51] <detritus25> You'd want at least 1 failsafe wouldn't you pat? Umbrella's incompetent but that's just basic reasoning.
[1:09:53] <coracor> so is it assassin's creed desyncing?
[1:09:54] <$insaneintentionsyo> orchW
[1:09:55] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Sherry gets it PRETTY BAD, too
[1:09:56] <thetruenicster> Sherry got the G Embryo in her
[1:09:57] <+Wizbiz_McBrix> Wizbiz_McBrix subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[1:09:57] <TurbulencEDrive> Only cutscene bites count
[1:09:58] <%VashyronM> God, this makes me want a Parasite Eve remake.
[1:09:58] <FalseEyeD> Jill, Leon, Sherry, Steve
[1:10:00] <%spoonbruh> Yh if you get bit in a cut scene it’s game over
[1:10:01] <%happyface699> @schrodingers_box That has literally been my plan but at a canned food supply warehouse
[1:10:02] <thedank> Sherry got tentacled tho
[1:10:02] <%0oki> Don’t forget about sherry, she got infected with G
[1:10:03] <%Cozy90> who the fuck said that??
[1:10:04] <%jillvxlentine> THE ELBOUW
[1:10:05] <%ledgefiendd> Do you wanna see more of Ethan from RE7? I'm interested to see his story evolve
[1:10:06] <%michingmallecho> What about leon?
[1:10:07] <+ConLin_Arts_> however WHAT??
[1:10:08] <thetruenicster> Leon got injected with Las Plagas egg
[1:10:09] <+ZephynM> I can't wait to see this game in the remake. It looks awesome.
[1:10:09] <+Initial_R> The cast is not resistant to the T virus
[1:10:09] <%silverira> don't forget Leon
[1:10:11] <%thevillainus> how does it change?
[1:10:13] <%xeros720> also you may die from the bite wound first before infection
[1:10:16] <%SolidusRex> Well done, HOWEVER
[1:10:17] <%crazy_laughter> ELLBOUW
[1:10:22] <%RPG_CHICAGO> no damage runs are CANON
[1:10:22] <Das_Beergut> OW, a zombie bit my neck, better clutch my liver for a while
[1:10:23] <%michingmallecho> Leon, save the bloodline
[1:10:27] <+Initial_R> Only Jill and Sherry have been infected with something
[1:10:34] <FalseEyeD> I hope they keep this for the Remake
[1:10:35] <thetruenicster> Claire got infected with T Phobos in Revelations 2
[1:10:37] <+ConLin_Arts_> :0
[1:10:50] <%michingmallecho> They said that Carlos is playable in R3make
[1:10:51] <%Jekado> well that does explain the bullets in the hospital then
[1:10:59] <%ClaudeMcGarren> @ledgefiendd i dont, he was insanely boring he had no background no kool skills to be known of he was just some boyfriend joe baker was way kooler
[1:11:00] <cochramd1992> If Leon and Claire hook up, what will Chrisposting become?
[1:11:01] <FalseEyeD> @Initial_R RE4 Leon?
[1:11:12] <$insaneintentionsyo> bawkGun
[1:11:15] <+Initial_R> Las plagas isn't a virus technically
[1:11:17] <%Birdigalore> I forgot about black mercenary
[1:11:17] <+ConLin_Arts_> yeah don't think they would change the playable characters to only one

[1:11:53] <NaturalGear> appropriate
[1:11:54] <%walternatorz> Patrick isn't looking too hot.
[1:11:57] <studleydoorite> I wonder if he's in Teppen
[1:11:57] <coracor> is that where VTM:B stole the camarilla ending from
[1:11:58] <%VashyronM> @AngriestPat Correction: His name WAS Patrick

[1:12:00] <UncleOliver> the R3make version of that's gonna be super gnarly
[1:12:02] <%ledgefiendd> tru @ClaudeMcGarren , but I think that leaves lots of room to add cool backstory to him/Mia
[1:12:02] <+Initial_R> Oh yeah for got about the fear virus in Rev 2 but yeah claire and miora then
[1:12:02] <%dukenux> that cutscene was so silly
[1:12:03] <%0oki> Some people on YouTube calling Tyrell or something like that
[1:12:03] <%pan_nochal> wonder if they'll make it gorier in RE3make
[1:12:03] <%happyface699> Damn traitor why’d he shoot me
[1:12:04] <+ConLin_Arts_> how didn't his face melt off??
[1:12:07] <KaliasTV> Shouldn't have tried to steal that bomb
[1:12:08] <%thevillainus> Why is the voice acting in the remake's trailer so garbage though
[1:12:09] <%crazy_laughter> Melanin is flammable. guys
[1:12:13] <%jillvxlentine> lol thats kinda dumb
[1:12:15] <djazo> thanks plot dev man
[1:12:19] <+elbishop> remind me why the Battletoads are in the hospital again ? Kappa
[1:12:21] <TurbulencEDrive> God I hope he gets melted in remake
[1:12:23] <%michingmallecho> R2make was pretty gory
[1:12:23] <+Initial_R> Claire Miora Jill and Sherry are the only people infected with a virus .
[1:12:24] <%godzookylives> oh god the frogs
[1:12:26] <Captain_Joe1911> atpSpiner
[1:12:26] <FalseEyeD> Re-Animator Style
[1:12:28] <%derekwst3> we need a spin off game where we can play as Patrick
[1:12:28] <coracor> look, umbrella can't help themselves
[1:12:28] <majima666> building this bio weapons next to the herpes clinic
[1:12:30] <BradVickers> Where anyone could just walk in.
[1:12:33] <%doc_ock_rokc> @thevillainus Because its true to the nature of RE
[1:12:35] <%ledgefiendd> RE7's strength lies so much in the Baker family, I also don't mind if they leave that story where it is
[1:12:36] <%Cozy90> Why does Suzy call herself the sphere hunter? I still don't know why.
[1:12:38] <majima666> these*
[1:12:38] <%walternatorz> shorter distance for doing human experiments
[1:12:40] <AfricanizedBees> An outbreak was inevitable, Umbrella had T-virus crap laying around all over town.
[1:12:40] <skinmansgds> Hey it's dat boi
[1:12:41] <+trekkie11041> @AngriestPat he kills himself with a granade upstairs trying to kill nikolai
[1:12:47] <Daxalog> RE always seemed like the most fucked world to live in. No where is safe.
[1:12:50] <cochramd1992> @majima666 what could possibly go wrong?
[1:12:50] <%crazy_laughter> @AngriestPat Hey gotta get those organ transplant somewhere
[1:12:52] <ospreyworks> I mean, it’s Umbrella
[1:12:53] <AfricanizedBees> If the rats hadn't spread it from the sewers, something else would have.
[1:12:54] <FalseEyeD> Umbrella Hospital confirmed
[1:12:56] <GMKGoat> Is this vaccine going to give Jill autism?
[1:12:57] <Das_Beergut> Yeah, but his last name is Rick and his middle name is Trick. So he's Pat Trick Rick or Patrick Trick Rick to his parents.
[1:12:58] <%doc_ock_rokc> Vaccines are only preventitive not a cure
[1:13:01] <%derekwst3> @Cozy90 she hunts sphears
[1:13:04] <%MaddyCaddy> Hate this puzzle
[1:13:05] <%Tracazoid> It kind of makes the first live action Resident Evil movie plausible within canon, if they didn't throw Nemesis in there at the end. And well, all the sequels.
[1:13:05] <%0oki> @initial_r when did Claire get infected, can’t remember

[1:17:02] <%michingmallecho> Carlito’s way
[1:17:10] <castlerock42> No wonder the UBCS got wiped out so quickly if this is how poorly those rifles work.
[1:17:11] <%doc_ock_rokc> but machine gun fire is worthless on zombies
[1:17:15] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Yeah so whys the city burning ? LUL
[1:17:16] <skinmansgds> Beta's have a tougher exterior

[1:17:33] <%TrollKing96> Pat the rifle has an alternate fire mode.
[1:17:35] <rytisone> right up the butt
[1:17:36] <+dirtyh4rr1> that was a nasty BJ
[1:17:39] <%FacetiousAF> @Reckless_Rob yeah, i think it has to do with the gamecube port
[1:17:41] <ospreyworks> This bit in the old LP is so fucking funnt
[1:17:41] <+Initial_R> zombie gave you the SUCCC
[1:17:42] <SMuffinMan> Gammas swallow you whole

[1:18:04] <+trekkie11041> thats outbreak pat
[1:18:05] <Reckless_Rob> @FacetiousAF what do you mean?
[1:18:07] <%mistersups> The Zombie groans. More like morning yawns.

[1:18:12] <spongeofmystery> @ospreyworks OHHHHHHHH WHYY?
[1:18:12] <djazo> remember how the machinegun was useless in the cutscene
[1:18:17] <+ConLin_Arts_> Data Woom
[1:18:17] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat Machinegun fire is worthless on zombies because only critical damage to the nervous system can stop them
[1:18:18] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat How much RE Outbreak File 1/2 did you play?
[1:18:20] <%ClaudeMcGarren> @doc_ock_rokc no it isnt if anything a high caliber rifle is great but this is video game we dont aim for the head for one shots lol
[1:18:31] <+ConLin_Arts_> WutFace

[1:18:41] <Reckless_Rob> Hunters
[1:18:41] <%FacetiousAF> @Reckless_Rob the game looks nice because its a mod and i'm pretty sure its a mod for the gamecube rom

[1:18:52] <%Jekado> are those red things bombs?
[1:18:54] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Sick

[1:19:06] <+theotherkristian> I have to make sure, is 4 next?
[1:19:07] <djazo> RE outbreak 2 was so much better then 1
[1:19:09] <cochramd1992> safe?
[1:19:09] <%spoonbruh> Outbreak is interesting because of the infection pool if you get bit
[1:19:12] <%Cozy90> Outbreak could be such an AMAZING GAME is capcom would just look into it.
[1:19:13] <%jillvxlentine> CVX is next
[1:19:13] <spongeofmystery> Hey, is their textured the same as Nemesis's?
[1:19:16] <FalseEyeD> Outbreak 2 was off the hook
[1:19:18] <+Initial_R> Decisions Decisions is such a difficult scenario
[1:19:18] <clown_shoes> how many viruses are here
[1:19:21] <spongeofmystery> arms
[1:19:22] <%Jekado> i wonder if there is gonna be a self destruct sequence at the end of the game....
[1:19:23] <Das_Beergut> If you lock a sickroom, it think it becomes a quarantine
[1:19:26] <+ConLin_Arts_> @AngriestPat favorite RE protagonist?
[1:19:27] <%ledgefiendd> those hunters(?) twitching on the ground like they're alive makes me uncomfortable
[1:19:28] <rytisone> Outbreak is still playable online on emulator
[1:19:35] <cochramd1992> Pat, the safe
[1:19:41] <%doc_ock_rokc> Due to the fact that their nerves still work it would be best to taze them to cause muscel lock up then headshot them while they are stunned
[1:19:43] <%mistersups> I don't know. But I can't wait to see the P - Virus.
[1:19:47] <majima666> if capcom released these modded versions on pc and console id buy them
[1:19:52] <link118> Do you prefer the over the shoulder in the later games?

[1:22:17] <%jillvxlentine> boomers are born during a specific time so no
[1:22:23] <%Jekado> aren't vaccines something you have to have before you get the disease?
[1:22:23] <%Puhff> Nice
[1:22:24] <%godzookylives> @Ascethetic they aren't STARS
[1:22:25] <%FirearmsInstructor> apatBig LUCK
[1:22:26] <%michingmallecho> Capcom told their investors that they’re looking to focus on reinvigorating old series and remakes of old games. I feel after R3Make releases the RE8 gets announced
[1:22:27] <Dragovus> fun times
[1:22:32] <%spoonbruh> Maybe that’s why the doctor in that room didn’t turn maybe he was bit but used vaccine then died from injuries
[1:22:32] <spongeofmystery> Fairly certain you don't just pour vaccine into a medium and shake it like a martini
[1:22:33] <%FacetiousAF> stAAARRRRRSSssss
[1:22:33] <Das_Beergut> @Jekado Shhhh
[1:22:34] <FalseEyeD> Phat Lucker
[1:22:36] <%ledgefiendd> oh I have emotes apatBig
[1:22:38] <Fujiwara_92> LUL
[1:22:42] <cochramd1992> @Jekado exactly, bad science in video games strikes again
[1:22:43] <AfricanizedBees> I blame the rabies vaccine, it's one of the few thata ctually works post-infection due to the weird way rabies works, so people started treating "vaccine" like "cure".
[1:22:44] <Ranger747> @Ascethetic Maybe hes too stuck on S.T.A.R.S
[1:22:44] <+elbishop> those Battletoads are fast
[1:22:45] <devanmuse> there are a LOT of bullets in that rifle
[1:22:46] <+Initial_R> @Ascethetic Nemesis gets pretty beat up by Jill the day before RE2
[1:22:47] <%Darren716> I wonder how theyll handle Carlos' rifle in the remake, will they give it actual ammo?
[1:22:48] <%derekwst3> @Cozy90 im 31 myself, will be 32 this month
[1:22:51] <%jillvxlentine> ikr that sucks

[1:22:54] <%Movemeister> @michingmallecho Powerstone when?
[1:23:00] <%Jekado> could you imaging anti zombie vaxxers?
[1:23:00] <FalseEyeD> Git Gud
[1:23:01] <neutral_guy> So you can basically get soft locked?
[1:23:02] <Fujiwara_92> knife him
[1:23:07] <the_millenial_falcon> Does this nemesis fight have an item drop?
[1:23:08] <ShinTeach> killing him is cool but you can just run
[1:23:09] <+blacksoap65> Are hunters people?
[1:23:12] <%crazy_laughter> @Jekado Yes, but Resident Evil logic
[1:23:14] <%Ascethetic> @godzookylives its weird that they never even see him in passing tho, but im sure it was just hardwware limitations
[1:23:14] <+ConLin_Arts_> Vaccines makes your body resistant by giving you a version of the disease so that the body builds up a resistance against it!
[1:23:15] <+Initial_R> But in the Remake 2 you can hear Nemesis's roar outside the RPD
[1:23:15] <Das_Beergut> @AfricanizedBees Well, zambies have always been compared to rabies.
[1:23:20] <%mield916> When's RE8?

[1:24:47] <Dragovus> I bet it was Jill who blew up the hospital

[1:30:23] <%Taisuru> So you just combine it with the grenade launcher then
[1:30:24] <majima666> do you need a decent pc to play this mod, i know its only re3 but it is the gamecube version after all
[1:30:24] <%FirearmsInstructor> Oh shit

[1:30:30] <+elbishop> infinite knife
[1:30:30] <@commanderclaw> I like the RE7 infinite ammo, it's just a box that sits in your inventory and gives everything infinite ammo
[1:30:32] <+p1llus> Is this a modded RE3?
[1:30:34] <%FacetiousAF> infinite shotgun makes me Kreygasm
[1:30:35] <majima666> this hunk of junk pc cant run gamecube games
[1:30:38] <uncledoodsauce> very certain nemesis won't drop items when you defeat him each encounter in remake. mr.x didn't drop anything.
[1:30:42] <skinmansgds> Assault Rifle measures it's ammo in %, and can't be refilled once it hits 0
[1:30:43] <%YaBoiShamoi> coolio
[1:30:49] <%Schrodingers_Box> That corridor always reminded me of RE2
[1:30:49] <%Wurmspawn> @clown_shoes Yeah you just run through the next door and leave him behind to go help Jill.
[1:30:50] <%Guardiansaiyan> @p1llus the mod makes RE3 look better

[1:31:11] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Can you use the MT a few times for funsies?
[1:31:12] <%Guardiansaiyan> yup
[1:31:15] <Dragovus> @AngriestPat but what type of grenade rounds does the infinite ammo box give you?
[1:31:20] <%Jekado> @FacetiousAF that sounds dangerious
[1:31:23] <SocialMisfitGamer> apatOrange
[1:31:24] <sonofthedeepsouth> Nice
[1:31:24] <skinmansgds> I dunno, but it's a lot
[1:31:26] <%terminallyCapriciousz> 7 Nemesis Kills for 7 RE games
[1:31:30] <skinmansgds> maybe an entire minute
[1:31:40] <%FirearmsInstructor> More ammo on the table
[1:31:42] <%Aydarkzero> it's bad? Kappa
[1:31:46] <skinmansgds> Each hit is as strong as a handgun
[1:31:52] <%FacetiousAF> @Jekado no more dangerous than leaving the mindflayer bodies around
[1:31:53] <%arcaderabbit48> @FacetiousAF That sounds like an item you'd get in Enter the Gungeon, and I want it
[1:31:58] <FalseEyeD> 6 Heals

[1:32:21] <%Aydarkzero> Kappa
[1:32:25] <%Jekado> its an explosion on them
[1:32:28] <the_millenial_falcon> Minethrower is the bowgun or RE3.
[1:32:32] <the_millenial_falcon> of*
[1:32:33] <%InugamiTheHound> @AngriestPat the Mine Thrower and TMP are both dog shit and Pat hates them
[1:32:36] <%Aydarkzero> does it at least have a aoe?
[1:32:37] <Das_Beergut> @Jekado So you can pretend to be Crash Man from MM2
[1:32:37] <neutral_guy> Just as bad as the one in RE4
[1:32:42] <$WackyXmand> better get the TMP pat
[1:32:44] <%Jekado> put infinite ammo on the minelayer
[1:32:53] <FalseEyeD> Whack
[1:32:56] <%FacetiousAF> that's fuckin cumb
[1:32:56] <%Typhaeon> I don't understand the point of that weapon
[1:32:58] <%FacetiousAF> DUMB
[1:32:58] <SnaKemuho> it's ammo to save other ammo that won't be used
[1:32:59] <%Typhaeon> Never did
[1:32:59] <%dukenux> that's so stupid
[1:33:01] <%godzookylives> wat
[1:33:09] <Das_Beergut> If you have an infinite ammo weapon, do you still reload?
[1:33:10] <%rufus2k2> TMP let me beat 2 gigantes apologize
[1:33:11] <%Cozy90> Pat you ever watch big trouble in little china?
[1:33:11] <+elbishop> best weapon Kappa
[1:33:12] <Daxalog> @FacetiousAF no no you said it right. Cumb
[1:33:14] <%FacetiousAF> its free ammo
[1:33:20] <castlerock42> God, it seems even the developers hate the mine thrower.

[1:33:27] <Das_Beergut> @Cozy90 I love you, just so you know.
[1:33:28] <%dukenux> i guess it's only useable against tigth rgroups of zombies
[1:33:28] <djazo> did someone say TMP IS BAD

[1:33:45] <%Cozy90> @Das_Beergut :D my favorite movie
[1:33:45] <%Jekado> forbidden pool noodles
[1:33:50] <skinmansgds> It's just random
[1:33:50] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat When the Mine Thrower is combined with the Infinite Bullets case, it gains infinite ammunition. The mine darts gain a homing ability that will automatically seek enemies and guide the darts towards their heads. Upon impact with an enemy, the dart will explode instantly, then exit target, and seek the next nearest enemy. It will detonate on every single hit, often resulting in a single dart killing everything in range
[1:33:51] <%XeroSigmaPrime> WTF TMP is the highest consistent DPS normal gun

[1:34:13] <skinmansgds> OH NO
[1:34:13] <%FacetiousAF> just seems like shit that a whole mine sticks in a zombie and can't kill the damn thing outright
[1:34:16] <%dukenux> yeah but Pat hates TMP for some reason

[1:40:18] <+prooffrock> Vergil and Dante fighting naked in a graveyard.
[1:40:19] <Fujiwara_92> gotta get the key
[1:40:20] <spyder_casual> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis SeemsGood
[1:40:22] <tiaramaki> Suddenly, spoiders
[1:40:23] <AfricanizedBees> No one knows good font design anymore.
[1:40:23] <%THATGUY_789> THATGUY_789 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 32 months! Fuck You It's January!!!!
[1:40:24] <+SharkyKrunk> wanna see if PATRICK was buried naked
[1:40:25] <%dukenux> There had to be atleast one nudist funeral, right?
[1:40:27] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> insta spiders
[1:40:27] <%derekwst3> leaches gone spiders come
[1:40:28] <Infantry762> So I'm watching "Witcher" without ever playing the game. I own Witcher 3 on steam, should I hold off on playing it or what?
[1:40:30] <@commanderclaw> I wonder if RE3 will have spoders
[1:40:33] <%SoFarFetched> "WE NEED MORE SPIDERS"
[1:40:36] <+chronopaladin> they're multiplying every sequel
[1:40:37] <+chaumiester> I don't remember spiders in RE2
[1:40:39] <Dragovus> Spiders for Summer Slam
[1:40:43] <Das_Beergut> Patrick "You're born naked and you're buried naked" Boivin.
[1:40:46] <%SoFarFetched> there werent alot
[1:40:46] <FalseEyeD> This is great atmosphere
[1:40:49] <natebud> Either spiders or baby gravediggers
[1:40:50] <majima666> there was a couple of spiders in the sewers in re2
[1:40:54] <TurtlesAndTentacles> when does this take place? I'm very confused
[1:40:55] <Lib3rator> @Lib3rator is new here. Say hello! VoHiYo
[1:40:55] <majima666> none in the remake though
[1:40:57] <%Jane_Lo> Because it's RANDOM, you can get a few different enemies here
[1:40:58] <spongeofmystery> @Infantry762 game and tv show have no crossover
[1:40:58] <+GeneralVicinity> SPODER
[1:40:58] <%Aydarkzero> so at this point of re3 re2 is happening right?
[1:41:00] <@commanderclaw> @Infantry762 You can do either, they can both stand alone cause they catch you up, and watching the show won't spoil anything
[1:41:07] <+chronopaladin> @TurtlesAndTentacles same time as re2
[1:41:09] <%Jane_Lo> not just the spiders
[1:41:10] <majima666> this is after re2
[1:41:12] <bear_breaker20> Cheesy on my peeny and sauca on my balls
[1:41:13] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> @Infantry762 It's say before the events of the games. You'd only know some of the characters that pop up.
[1:41:14] <%crazy_laughter> "i'm gonna bury you naked!" is a top tier threat
[1:41:15] <rickyjones47> Was there spiders in re2 remake?
[1:41:18] <majima666> up until gets infected its before re2
[1:41:20] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> @Infantry762 set
[1:41:22] <%Teintstein> one guy
[1:41:24] <majima666> jill gets infected*

[1:41:48] <Ipsenscastle> @Infantry762 do whatever - people keep asking this question but the thing is it was mainly short stories to begin with, and every adaptation has that same quality. Everything is a good starting point

[1:42:07] <%dukenux> I mean, being buried naked makes a poetic sense, but no one want to look at grandpa's shriveled, purple balls when they fare him well.
[1:42:07] <Das_Beergut> Jill bunny hopping down the stairs again

[1:43:18] <FalseEyeD> Y-yes
[1:43:19] <AllTheZibas> Yes :)
[1:43:20] <%MayorRev> its ok
[1:43:20] <cochramd1992> is that carlos?
[1:43:24] <%happyface699> He comin
[1:43:24] <%terminallyCapriciousz> yes, i love the mine thrower
[1:43:25] <TheManofManyQuestions> yep
[1:43:26] <AfricanizedBees> Every old RE needs a pointless, ineffective weapon.
[1:43:26] <UncleOliver> i love throwing mimes
[1:43:26] <%Cozy90> A dead guy witha key? Why wasn't he naked?
[1:43:27] <+blacksoap65> Pog
[1:43:29] <rytisone> who said they love mine thrower?
[1:43:29] <Ipsenscastle> how did they not kill you, that was like 10 hits
[1:43:30] <natebud> Mine thrower is great vs nemesis
[1:43:31] <+whackashack> I guess not.
[1:43:35] <FalseEyeD> D a t a
[1:43:35] <Stillchr> @AngriestPat Infinite ammo minethrower acts differently
[1:43:36] <+chronopaladin> DATA
[1:43:38] <FalseEyeD> Fat Data
[1:43:39] <Dragovus> @AngriestPat More like Mind Throwing this in the garbage?
[1:43:41] <+Initial_R> Minethrowing it in the trash
[1:43:48] <Ipsenscastle> Combat Brent Spiner
[1:43:49] <AfricanizedBees> Yes, it is a homing rocket.
[1:43:49] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat When the Mine Thrower is combined with the Infinite Bullets case, it gains infinite ammunition. The mine darts gain a homing ability that will automatically seek enemies and guide the darts towards their heads. Upon impact with an enemy, the dart will explode instantly, then exit target, and seek the next nearest enemy. It will detonate on every single hit, often resulting in a single dart killing everything in range
[1:43:50] <%Cozy90> Why wasn't he naked?
[1:43:51] <danpc5> Data Wait!
[1:43:52] <RepairsInProgress> Yes
[1:43:53] <AfricanizedBees> With no timer.
[1:43:53] <%Aydarkzero> that's stupid
[1:44:03] <Cosairen> should have been the mind thrower tbh like an alluring skull
[1:44:07] <TurtlesAndTentacles> @initial_r damn so they stayed in Racoon city even though they knew the risks? did the police not believe them cause the chief was dirty?
[1:44:11] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat It becomes a smart cluster bomb
[1:44:11] <%crazy_laughter> @Cozy90 He wasn't buried yet, of course.
[1:44:11] <%dukenux> whoa
[1:44:18] <lethallylactic> PogChamp
[1:44:18] <%dukenux> So it's a secret OP joke weapon
[1:44:19] <phatballlz54> yep it's pretty cook
[1:44:20] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LIKE IN TUROK?
[1:44:22] <FalseEyeD> OP
[1:44:22] <mr_hunter> Wowzers
[1:44:23] <tiaramaki> I'm sorry, wat
[1:44:24] <natebud> The infinite minethrower acts like Micheal Rookers arrow from Guardians
[1:44:27] <phatballlz54> *cool
[1:44:31] <@commanderclaw> That's a fucking quake weapon there
[1:44:32] <Ahk_90> Jesus that's strong

[1:44:49] <%happyface699> Yondu
[1:44:53] <+Initial_R> @TurtlesAndTentacles and it was because Umbrella had the city under control

[1:46:33] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Steve is a duck
[1:46:33] <natebud> If you thought the feel of 1 to 2 was bad, wait until you go from 3 to CVX
[1:46:38] <Dragovus> "Steve is suffering" - GOOD!
[1:46:38] <neutral_guy> @AngriestPat Whats the general opinion on Resident Evil CVX? I've always heard mixed things about it
[1:46:39] <%Kegeto> claire is better anyway
[1:46:39] <%pan_nochal> CHECK OUT CLAIRE'S ASS AND GET TURNED INTO HULK, YEAAH
[1:46:42] <+Initial_R> The entire prison was going to hell and he wanted to trade guns
[1:46:45] <%happyface699> FUCK RUNNING FROM STEVE

[1:46:50] <+iamwood99> steve more like dweeve
[1:46:53] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> The Hunk run in RE2 remake is low key my favourite thing about the game
[1:46:53] <jicabou> STEVE IS GREAT HOW DARE YOU, JUST LOOK AT HIS STUPID HAIR
[1:47:02] <%comfyman12> But Patrick, what about the Nokia RE games?!?
[1:47:04] <Ipsenscastle> I really want to watch you play an obscure terrible RE game for the novelty factor
[1:47:05] <cochramd1992> Pat, the lighter, you just mentioned it
[1:47:06] <+trekkie11041> @neutral_guy its very meh compared to the rest
[1:47:06] <MSN04_Sazabi> The biggest problem of RE4 on PC is that having mouse aim makes it a tad too easy
[1:47:08] <%Cozy90> steve has an amazing chocker
[1:47:09] <BradVickers> @RAAAAAINMAKER Same.
[1:47:11] <FalseEyeD> nGage when?
[1:47:12] <rytisone> I just think of Steve checking out Claire's butt in Darkside Chronicles
[1:47:13] <TigerClaws12> LUL
[1:47:16] <%dukenux> LUL
[1:47:16] <%JJCheeker> Code Veronica has a lot of back tracking

[1:47:20] <majima666> re2 on the gamecom
[1:47:22] <%Aydarkzero> oof
[1:47:28] <+trekkie11041> like re4 on the wii
[1:47:29] <@commanderclaw> RE4 Wii was so fucking easy
[1:47:29] <Das_Beergut> @AngriestPat slip in a Silent Hill game for goofs.
[1:47:29] <cochramd1992> Paaaaat, the lighter
[1:47:31] <the_millenial_falcon> should have started with series with sweet home
[1:47:31] <%Jekado> IT FREE HEADSHOTS
[1:47:32] <%comfyman12> Surprisingly, not as bad as the Wii version
[1:47:32] <spongeofmystery> Wii release levels of cheating
[1:47:33] <%happyface699> Steve actively fucks up the situation
[1:47:35] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @comfyman12 Wii version actually uses alot of the PS2 low poly models still, while replacing some with the better GC models. Its wierdly incosistent
[1:47:37] <bluefooddye1> What about RE Gaiden tho?
[1:47:39] <Ipsenscastle> GDQ says mouse aim is crazy good
[1:47:43] <%InugamiTheHound> use the chainsaw controller for the gamecube to play RE4
[1:47:44] <%Aydarkzero> re4 wii is the easiest thing dude
[1:47:45] <TigerClaws12> like dirty cheatbox players Kappa
[1:47:45] <FalseEyeD> My mind thinks nGage = Gamescom
[1:47:48] <Prevot> re4 wii best re4 version
[1:47:49] <%Cozy90> YE RE GAIDEN DO THAT ONE!
[1:48:00] <@commanderclaw> Imagine RE4 VR
[1:48:02] <FalseEyeD> Sexy
[1:48:04] <natebud> You can't even defend Steve ironically, he's obectively the worst.
[1:48:04] <Das_Beergut> @bluefooddye1 So we can see that authentic Gameboy Color mouse cursor.
[1:48:08] <Fujiwara_92> BIG AMMO
[1:48:08] <%Aydarkzero> it was fun though
[1:48:14] <%MelBrooksKA> Were they still teaching you how to type with old typewritters when you were in grade/middle school, Pat?
[1:48:16] <%Tracazoid> What about RE1 on the Game Boy Colour? Prior to Gaiden of course.

[1:59:06] <%spoonbruh> So the next stream for any sort of resi will be next week yeah?
[1:59:13] <%Jekado> its weird because the dick twisting thing also reminds me of a japanese wrestling thing where someone grabs a wrestler in the dick and the guy counters by "Flexing" his dick and throwing the guy.
[1:59:24] <natebud> Only if theres no zombies
[1:59:26] <%happyface699> @jekado Damn

[2:00:19] <AfricanizedBees> Imagine connecting the entrance to secret Umbrella Lab #1175 directly to a public park via an old suspicious bridge.

[2:00:48] <FeralFozzie> is it someone with an untwistable dick?
[2:00:53] <Das_Beergut> @oniwahoo There's no one to hold his cell phone and he doesn't want it to get wet
[2:00:56] <phatballlz54> this choice is basically: do you want Nikolai to be faced fucked by Nemmy or do you want to blow him up yourself
[2:01:01] <RepairsInProgress> I don't see it
[2:01:07] <%valriot> I want a Resi game that just has one normal guy in the game as an enemy

[2:15:49] <%MaddyCaddy> The solution is random out of a set of 3 too iirc
[2:15:51] <akaSiggy> @AngriestPat If you forget about the little ones and focus on the long flat ones' positioning it should fall into place. All you have to do is find where the long ones go

[2:16:15] <%takiyami> Isn't this the game where the early copies had entirely different puzzles, and so all of the guides were based on the wrong puzzles?

[2:38:07] <natebud> Is this the first time someone actually intentionally activated the self desruct in an RE game?
[2:38:08] <+konekoryugamine> Watch it be Umbrella CEO's wife or some shit
[2:38:13] <%SoFarFetched> Hey Umbrella knows they gotta do anything to destroy any evidence,Of course they thought of missles ahead of time.

[2:38:27] <%doc_ock_rokc> Because Umbrella are paranoid
[2:38:31] <oniwahoo> @katalist_ Can you imagine if he came back for one final showdown while we are trying to escape from the missile?
[2:38:32] <%LaughingCatt> Umbrella is evil & was expecting missile retaliation?
[2:38:34] <KaliasTV> Demon invasion in progress
[2:38:34] <Ner234> Umbrella KNEW they were gonna nuked for their bullshit eventually LUL
[2:38:37] <$RealThiele> just need to carry a few anti-personnel mines

[2:38:54] <KasiCrafter> They'd have a dedicated "O SHI THE POPO'S HERE" alarm, but a missle-specific warning is really weird.
[2:38:55] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> Umbrella and their contengencies
[2:39:02] <%Katalist_> @oniwahoo I can't actually. That'd be too crazy
[2:39:06] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat OH SHIT, GET THE FUCK OUTTA HERE! WHAT ARE YOU DOING? GO, GET THE FUCK OUTTA HERE YOU STUPID IDIOT! FUCK, WE'RE ALL DEAD, GET THE FUCK OUT! My God, did that smell good.

[2:40:08] <%Jekado> does that G stand for gangster
[2:40:09] <$RealThiele> weapon to rival metal gear
[2:40:11] <Ace_Flibble> Jill is now very literally equipped with... ballistics.
[2:40:13] <FrankysDream> @AngriestPat can you infinite ammo the rocket launcher too?
[2:40:16] <+konekoryugamine> If you can still move and get items and talk to people YOU ARE NOT DONE YET
[2:40:16] <+ChaosAethr> So Quick Question What is nemesis exactly
[2:40:17] <%Jekado> gangster launcher
[2:40:30] <%Taisuru> Rlauncher and Glauncher
[2:40:34] <Das_Beergut> RAW-KET LAWN-CHAIR!
[2:40:36] <natebud> magnum though
[2:40:37] <%SoFarFetched> he is the ULITMATE....BIO-WEAPON
[2:40:39] <+SlumberMan> @ChaosAethr A Mr. X with a crazy parasite.
[2:40:41] <+GenesisKnight> That Rlauncher is half the size of her body
[2:40:41] <AfricanizedBees> A souped-up custom Tyrant with a monster bug in its head.
[2:40:43] <sonofthedeepsouth> Nemesis is a gamer infected with the g virus
[2:40:44] <%valriot> Mugnum
[2:40:45] <%Jekado> she looks goofy walking aroud with that
[2:40:45] <%derekwst3> why does he need a rocket launcher, nemisis is dead
[2:40:45] <UncleOliver> Nemesis is a big boy
[2:40:53] <+Fynale> i just now realized that launching nukes at umbrella would be back cuz wouldn't that potentially just mutate the t-virus into something worse?
[2:40:56] <skinmansgds> Nemesis is just a skinsuit
[2:40:56] <Das_Beergut> But then you have TWO and you can DUAL_WEILD them
[2:41:06] <%doc_ock_rokc> @ChaosAethr A MR X clone with a Nemisis Parasite that gives him inhanced cognitive ablities and strenght at the cost of looking like shit
[2:41:07] <%Cykron> Is the grenade launcher Jill’s bloodline technique?
[2:41:08] <BradVickers> Nemesis is Mr. X having a bad day.
[2:41:14] <sonofthedeepsouth> Nemesis is just chemicals
[2:41:15] <$RealThiele> looking forward to nemesis model swapped with mister clean
[2:41:17] <SociallyAwkwardToaster> why does that sound like the goldeneye sniper rifle

[2:41:31] <+konekoryugamine> Wouldn't it be awesome if Jill had feet like Isaac Clarke?
[2:41:32] <rytisone> you gonna kill him?
[2:41:37] <thatWaulfyguy> sum raison...
[2:41:37] <skinmansgds> Nemesis HATES getting sprayed by acid

[2:45:34] <$Afterman_> yea yea american military power
[2:45:35] <%asgard147> I HOPE WE GET TO SEE THAT BATTLE IN THE REMAKE limesPoggers
[2:45:35] <%olaksi> Woah, they are almost as good as Parasite Eve military
[2:45:36] <+konekoryugamine> They took them on but died in a blaze of glory.
[2:45:37] <%JJCheeker> we're not tools of umbrella or anyone else
[2:45:38] <%Jmann1892> Marines are badasses
[2:45:40] <Saltmeisterr> wait wtf theres more Mr Xs?
[2:45:40] <%BallerSwagBro9k> "SALUTE" BibleThump
[2:45:40] <+pectusumbra> Greatest Soldiers in the world~

[2:45:42] <%Cykron> God bless our boys in uniform
[2:45:42] <%0oki> Hope we get to see that fight in the remake
[2:45:43] <Das_Beergut> That's just MISTER-X-TION!
[2:45:44] <%Psych_man13_13> A Mr.X killed by the REORC guys?
[2:45:44] <$Ziegsy> Theres one in the spotlight, losing his religion
[2:45:44] <%derekwst3> dont mess with the marines
[2:45:45] <Renuarb> @AngriestPat As lame as the game was, Operation Raccoon City does attempt to recrate THIS unseen battle with the US Army
[2:45:45] <clown_shoes> they probably all were firing rocket launchers, a properly balanced team
[2:45:46] <zettig> Is Nemesis like a Super-Mr.X?
[2:45:46] <%ospreyworks> That would be sick
[2:45:46] <rytisone> they probably used some sort of railgun
[2:45:46] <+blacksoap65> Merica
[2:45:47] <sonofthedeepsouth> Kappa 7
[2:45:49] <$RealThiele> why do BIO when GUN will do?
[2:45:51] <+MajorCrasher> they used several rocket launchers LUL
[2:45:53] <sonofthedeepsouth> MURICA
[2:45:54] <NaturalGear> I mean, if a rookie cop managed to kill one all by himslef...
[2:45:54] <%doc_ock_rokc> @cochramd1992 They unleashed 6 mr xs and a Nemisis into racoon city
[2:45:54] <skinmansgds> Man Tyrants are garbage
[2:45:55] <vonmaultke> KKona
[2:45:55] <%Taisuru> Or maybe Mr. X is just a BITCH
[2:45:56] <$Afterman_> even tho they died, they did a good job
[2:45:56] <$LocDogX86X> USA !!!!!
[2:45:57] <Ner234> More bullets were shot inn this room than most wars LUL
[2:45:59] <Rayorin> OORAH
[2:46:00] <$Chimeraelite> Well now we know what the sidestories are gonna be
[2:46:00] <$Ziegsy> 'Chicken, battery'
[2:46:00] <UncleOliver> they're ridicolous but also fuckin dead
[2:46:01] <+konekoryugamine> The FUCK is that thing?!
[2:46:01] <+SlumberMan> Well they're dead now.
[2:46:03] <Saltmeisterr> @AngriestPat there was more than one Mr X?
[2:46:03] <natebud> Can't wait for that extra chapter in remake
[2:46:03] <+SharkyKrunk> Chicken.. battered...
[2:46:06] <+Zereaux> @AngriestPat why hasnt hunk had a game?
[2:46:06] <NaderShahDidNothingWrong> Maybe the bioweapons aren't all they're hacked to be
[2:46:06] <+amiroodude> That is genuinely great

[2:46:08] <%arcaderabbit48> Mr. eXecuted!
[2:46:09] <BurdRightsActivist> thank god there's this random RAILGUN here
[2:46:09] <%BallerSwagBro9k> I want to see that fight in a R3make DLC LUL
[2:46:11] <AfricanizedBees> THE PARACELSUS SWORD
[2:46:12] <devanmuse> i mean... one guy was enough to kill the other tyrants
[2:46:12] <%Cykron> Tyrants job so hard
[2:46:15] <%derekwst3> we need a spin off based on these MOFOS
[2:46:19] <%InugamiTheHound> what about RE orc guys they killed a bunch of tyrants and they brought the Nemesis alive
[2:46:21] <cochramd1992> @doc_ock_rokc so....Mr X in RE2 was actually 6 different guys?
[2:46:21] <JetpackMcQuack> Hoo raw
[2:46:26] <%valriot> Chris can literally punch a boulder, a team should be able to kill a Mr.X
[2:46:34] <$RealThiele> all the Mr. X here need hats
[2:46:35] <clown_shoes> is this thing in the upper right just a glorified timer?
[2:46:36] <AfricanizedBees> *splet*
[2:46:37] <%happyface699> Re 2 mr x is papa x
[2:46:38] <%asgard147> limesS
[2:46:38] <Ner234> You have to admit, they did a good job making Nemesis. Thing is durable beyond belief.
[2:46:39] <Gustave_XIII> Blarf
[2:46:39] <+konekoryugamine> Figured.
[2:46:41] <Das_Beergut> So, it looks like 2.3 marines per Mr. X
[2:46:45] <%doc_ock_rokc> @cochramd1992 No We were hunted by ONE of the Six Mr Xs
[2:46:46] <skinmansgds> nom the super x
[2:46:48] <spongeofmystery> @konekoryugamine it's called Paracelsus' Sword, which is the most bomb-ass name for a weapon
[2:46:48] <NaturalGear> succ
[2:46:49] <%LaughingCatt> oh no he goopin
[2:46:49] <$Chimeraelite> bruh
[2:46:49] <Das_Beergut> Not a bad ratio
[2:46:49] <%derekwst3> x gonna give it to yah
[2:46:52] <%jcflyguy> Fitting, the new season of Railgun just started.
[2:46:53] <FutaSnek> well fuck
[2:46:54] <%arcaderabbit48> Ew. Its like he pours in to the room like a puddle
[2:46:58] <%FirearmsInstructor> @clown_shoes Yes, but it uses weird distance scale instead of seconds
[2:46:58] <AfricanizedBees> BIG BRAIN
[2:46:58] <+pectusumbra> Did that headless corpse eat another corpse? HOW
[2:47:01] <+Zereaux> @chat Like isnt hunk like the big boss of this universe?
[2:47:03] <%Sartastic> exponential growth!
[2:47:04] <%dukenux> Growing extra eyes also
[2:47:04] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Takes a licking....AND KEEPS ON KICKING
[2:47:04] <thatWaulfyguy> GIVE HIM THE OL DICK TWIST
[2:47:05] <%derekwst3> Jill doesnt know that yet
[2:47:05] <sonofthedeepsouth> WHY WOULD U DESIGN IT LIKE THIS
[2:47:05] <Das_Beergut> Where's the giant eye?!?
[2:47:08] <%Schrodingers_Box> I only just noticed, He gets like that after eating a Super Mr X
[2:47:08] <%arcaderabbit48> That's a brain on his back
[2:47:11] <+konekoryugamine> This dude does not give up.
[2:47:12] <%Cykron> Oh it’s that time of the RE game isn’t it?
[2:47:12] <zettig> !uptime
[2:47:13] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 47m.

[2:47:27] <%JJCheeker> Too many
[2:47:27] <+SharkyKrunk> I wonder if it spits acid cause it absorbed it in the las tfight?
[2:47:31] <%doc_ock_rokc> @cochramd1992 Maybe TWO Mr.Xs
[2:47:31] <%FirearmsInstructor> @clown_shoes Every 10k "distance" is a second, so it's like a 6 minute fight
[2:47:32] <%ElkRiverDog> Ah, good Ol cougar snarl
[2:47:33] <Rayorin> @das_beergut plot armor is powerful. the Marines didn't have it, that's why some of them died unfortunately
[2:47:34] <Alzero83> Ready the MOONSTONE CANNON!
[2:47:37] <oniwahoo> @katalist_ Oh no, the unthinkable has happened!
[2:47:39] <%asgard147> limesPoggers
[2:47:41] <DuoScratch> he needs to be chased in the corner though, and the rocket's okay at that.
[2:47:43] <Deadbulky> IMA FIRIN MUH LAZOR
[2:47:43] <+SlumberMan> Do any other final bosses tank rocket launcher shots like Nemesis?
[2:47:45] <sonofthedeepsouth> OH BOY HE COMIN
[2:47:45] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> shooting STARS break da moooooold
[2:47:47] <Ace_Flibble> I tried to buy all the RE3 toys, which each came with apiece of this mutant Nemesis to build when you had the full set. Never could find Carlos though.
[2:47:47] <%Cykron> I feed my Nemesis STARS. He is growing stronger
[2:47:51] <%dukenux> Then why is Tyrant also growing eyes? IS this just a "feature" sewn into all virus strains?
[2:47:52] <SociallyAwkwardToaster> ok but why is the rail cannon here of all places
[2:47:53] <%happyface699> OH LAWD
[2:47:54] <+razielhex> the ol razzle dazzle
[2:47:56] <LunarKeidran> I love the charging sound
[2:47:57] <$RealThiele> microwave that hot pocket
[2:47:58] <%M4T1A5> I see you have to do the in order so nemesis path finds in front of the railgun
[2:47:59] <%cowardman93> holy shit did Patt just book it all the way from gravedigger to here?
[2:48:01] <natebud> The marines fought Scary X, Sporty X, Baby X, Ginger X and Posh X
[2:48:02] <%Darren716> Wait why was the rail gun even in raccoon city?
[2:48:02] <BradVickers> Avenge me!
[2:48:05] <spongeofmystery> Jill fucking SHADOWSTEPPED
[2:48:05] <+konekoryugamine> Anyone here play throgh Project X Zone and see Nemesis' battle with Jill?

[2:51:58] <UncleOliver> racoon city status: dabbed on
[2:51:58] <TurbulencEDrive> Baerie

[2:52:18] <$RealThiele> and then their skin melts off
[2:52:18] <%luckysteak> Ironically, a nuke might be a totally appropriate response
[2:52:19] <sonofthedeepsouth> HOLD ON
[2:52:19] <Press_X_ToJASON> barry and jill are a radiation sandwich
[2:52:20] <spongeofmystery> EMP as well
[2:52:20] <%LaughingCatt> good thing nukes dont have radiation
[2:52:21] <rytisone> that heatwave hits the chopper
[2:52:21] <powerprotoman> and thats why shes blonde in the future nuclear radiation
[2:52:22] <%VashyronM> Okay, if that Helicopter was hit by the EMP, it would go down

[2:52:25] <$joylent_blue> no shut up tho
[2:52:26] <sonofthedeepsouth> SHOCKWAVE VS HELI
[2:52:26] <TurbulencEDrive> EMP, did the covenent set off a nuke?
[2:52:26] <%valriot> @angriestpat Wouldnt the nuke cause an EMP and turn off the Helicopters power????

[2:52:42] <%AncelDeLambert> I don't even know if the nuke would have properly sanitized the city given those sewers
[2:52:43] <majima666> rather unfortunate....a fucking city got NUKED OFF THE MAP
[2:52:43] <%ChaosAethr> the clean slate
[2:52:43] <AfricanizedBees> Canonically absolutely nothing survived the nuke IIRC. Not a thing, human escapees aside.
[2:52:43] <Amasepyt> Remember the truck driver from remake 2 that went straight into the city just as it's about to fucking blow up
[2:52:43] <Ner234> Only "unfortunate" LUL

[2:53:03] <AfricanizedBees> 100k is REALLY small for a city as built up as RC.

[2:53:18] <+Tonku_the_Red> Racoon City LITERALLY just died.
[2:53:19] <Deadbulky> Nah do it twice to make sure, gotta double tap
[2:53:20] <FutaSnek> So are zombies LUL
[2:53:21] <%cowardman93> RE6 literally happened

[2:53:27] <%derekwst3> it wasnt a nuke, it was just a weather ballon
[2:53:27] <spongeofmystery> But it was Solidus's plan all along
[2:53:30] <rytisone> oh this theme rules

[2:53:33] <%SlashHabit> Right, I would turn Racoon into a theme park ride

[2:53:46] <+amiroodude> Yeah that does put things in perspective
[2:53:47] <%fruit_pie_the_magician> There are bombs that are as strong as nukes, or at least small nukes, that arent thermonuclear
[2:53:49] <Kirby_Sauce> 100000 seems like a low kill count for a nuke, but maybe that's cause im from NYC
[2:53:50] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> listen to dat music
[2:53:51] <DuoScratch> yes, Code Veronica DIDN'T happen.

[2:54:09] <%Jekado> i love how making zombies and causing a town getting nuked won't bring you down but not making your stock investors happy will
[2:54:11] <+kikanshat0masu> I think it’s a good call
[2:54:11] <red_blaster> Umbrella Chronicles deals with Umbrella shutting down
[2:54:11] <%patriotrenegade> The US has dropped a lot of nukes on the US itself, mostly on accident. But they almost blew up West Virginia. @angriestpat
[2:54:12] <%dukenux> chill post nuclear explosion beats
[2:54:12] <%Jmann1892> isn't Code Veronica like weeks after RE2?
[2:54:13] <Amasepyt> SourPls

[2:56:21] <%Katalist_> Better get started on the other 7 then
[2:56:23] <+razielhex> Gary, Indiana is what happens if Fallout really occurred. it's off Lake Michigan. It used to be a huge mill industry but global capital and urban decay/white flight hit it super hard. It borders East Chicago, and since it's across the state lines, it's easy to obtain firearms there. It used to be in rank 10 of the highest unsolved homocide rate.

[2:57:05] <Das_Beergut> RE4 on Wii, right?!?
[2:57:06] <Zebylth> why?
[2:57:07] <DracaenaLeaf> I thought people liked CVX on ps3 more than PS4?
[2:57:07] <%Sartastic> CVX is prime Resident Evil

[2:57:21] <%patriotrenegade> Play CVX now. Do it. Do it. Do it. Do it. Do it.
[2:57:23] <sonofthedeepsouth> HUNK Kreygasm
[2:57:23] <+tierst> You could just play Dino Crisis instead
[2:57:26] <%bluebiscuit94> Honestly Curious about CVX, I've never seen anything about it
[2:57:27] <+chaumiester> RE4 PC with HD Mod pack!
[2:57:28] <SociallyAwkwardToaster> cool thanks capcom!
[2:57:28] <phatballlz54> the PS4 version for CVX is so dark though..
[2:57:28] <+Tonku_the_Red> Games for Windows was such a mistake. . .
[2:57:29] <%ospreyworks> There isn’t a seamless version for the GameCube CVX?
[2:57:30] <+burkey0307> i lost all my RE5 save data when they removed GFWL
[2:57:31] <Mishal21S> CVX’s best version is PS3
[2:57:32] <%Sartastic> full of tasty cheese
[2:57:33] <majima666> ps3/360 version of cvx is a new port. iirc the ps4 version is the ps2 version being emulated
[2:57:34] <+kikanshat0masu> Bold claim
[2:57:35] <Heartless_01> good ol' pos4 <3
[2:57:36] <natebud> How do you feel about playing the worst mainline RE game next?
[2:57:37] <%cowardman93> I can't wait to finally see CVX it's the only game I've never touched
[2:57:37] <+REDtheBEAST> BibleThump bukFeels
[2:57:38] <+trekkie11041> @AngriestPat theres a fan patch that fixes re5
[2:57:39] <Das_Beergut> RE4 Wii, right!
[2:57:40] <+DiabloDeAzul> I never noticed anything wrong with my RE5
[2:57:41] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @razielhex Youre super right. Used to live like 2 hours east and woul drive by it whenever I went to Chicago. Actual post apocalyptic
[2:57:41] <Mr_Strut> gfwl claims another victim
[2:57:41] <+StooEsq> GFWL was the scariest thing about RE5 on PC
[2:57:44] <%Taisuru> Games for windows DEAD amirite?
[2:57:45] <rickyjones47> Thanks for the stream Pat. Good night everyone!
[2:57:45] <%olaksi> Dino crisis would be goodl yeah
[2:57:50] <%valriot> No CVX on PC but DMC2 on Switch LUL LUL
[2:57:50] <%MayorRev> goodnight
[2:57:53] <FalseEyeD> That's true
[2:57:58] <+TekkieX> The CVX ports have new lighting, it's bad
[2:57:58] <FalseEyeD> They look VERY DIFFERENT
[2:58:01] <sonofthedeepsouth> DINO CRSIS PAT
[2:58:03] <%cowardman93> DMC2 will infect everything
[2:58:06] <%misha_kastrilevich> misha_kastrilevich subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 1 month streak! Damn, is the stream ending
[2:58:06] <%mckraven> mckraven subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 14 months! 
[2:58:09] <Deadbulky> Dinosaaaaurs
[2:58:10] <%Taisuru> It is but it's the PS4 emulation which does a ton of extra stuff
[2:58:10] <%Sartastic> just torrent it, we won't look
[2:58:11] <FalseEyeD> PS3 and PS4 versions look different
[2:58:11] <%BallerSwagBro9k> -
[2:58:12] <%Psych_man13_13> PLAY REORC
[2:58:13] <TurbulencEDrive> dmc2 is the bets

[2:58:38] <+trekkie11041> theres a patch by maluc for re5 thats fixes alot of shit and removes the gfwl check that breaks things
[2:58:39] <natebud> I can wait for the Albanoid boss fight. Everyone start hyping the Albanoid.
[2:58:39] <%ospreyworks> Brad Vickers is in Hell
[2:58:40] <BradVickers> @Cykron Thanks buddy.
[2:58:41] <Das_Beergut> When's RE:Gaiden?
[2:58:44] <oniwahoo> DMC2 and Skyrim will be the first games available on the next generation of consoles

[2:59:02] <%Darren716> Welp time to dig out the ps triple bllin
[2:59:03] <%Cykron> @bradvickers Brad “Nuke Em All” Vickers
[2:59:04] <%derekwst3> whats stupid?
[2:59:06] <%XeroSigmaPrime> PS3 and XBOX 360 are best versions
[2:59:08] <FalseEyeD> Mindbroken
[2:59:09] <%XeroSigmaPrime> lol
[2:59:10] <SocialMisfitGamer> @AngriestPat so on a 1-10 scale, what do you rate this game?
[2:59:13] <%valriot> @angriestpat The PS4s ps2 ports are a fucking JOKE. The Jak Trilogy, despite being FUCKING REMASTERED on PS3, is a shitty emulated version on PS4
[2:59:19] <+trekkie11041> theres a patch by maluc for re5 thats fixes alot of shit and removes the gfwl check that breaks things
[2:59:22] <Snektor> I better get my Dino Crisis remake or I swear to god
[2:59:24] <%dukenux> apatDab_HF apatDab apatDab_HF apatDab apatDab_HF apatDab
[2:59:26] <%cowardman93> play the worst version of CVX
[2:59:27] <sonofthedeepsouth> CHICKEN HEART VICKERS DLC
[2:59:30] <rytisone> -1 for that water puzzle?
[2:59:30] <%cowardman93> it's what it deserves
[2:59:32] <%0oki> Are you going to start cvx now?
[2:59:33] <%dukenux> that's high
[2:59:36] <%pan_nochal> @AngriestPat how much would you rate CVX? Kappa
[2:59:37] <%Cykron> That’s generous
[2:59:40] <%SolidusRex> Wouldn't emulating CVX on Dolphin be better?
[2:59:40] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> night
[2:59:41] <natebud> CVX looks worse because it deserves it.
[2:59:42] <%dukenux> was expecting an 8
[2:59:42] <+machshop> :(
[2:59:52] <+razielhex> CVX for Ouya
[2:59:58] <jaketify> have you heard about style switching on dmc3 for switch?
[3:00:00] <%bluebiscuit94> bathroom break
[3:00:01] <oniwahoo> 9 is a high rating
[3:00:02] <%Cykron> Thank me for my service
[3:00:09] <$joylent_blue> jaketify yeah they talked about it on the podcast
[3:00:18] <Mishal21S> RE3 is the best in the series anyway
[3:00:18] <%Darren716> Wait whys the podcast on Wed?
[3:00:19] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @AngriestPat Xbox One has the HD release version thats on PS3 and 360
[3:00:21] <%MaddyCaddy> Don't play one
[3:00:26] <%bluebiscuit94> Good night Pat
[3:00:27] <jaketify> @joylent_blue oh ok, thanks
[3:00:29] <%MaddyCaddy> It's the best worst game you'll play
[3:00:30] <%Faustgesicht> I startled a t witcher 3
[3:00:30] <Das_Beergut> Watch a playthrough?
[3:00:32] <%pan_nochal> Play 1, it's better than Witcher 2 imo
[3:00:36] <Kirby_Sauce> Skip one and 2
[3:00:38] <derap41> Witcher 2 is really jank and not worth it
[3:00:43] <%MaddyCaddy> 2 just sucks
[3:00:44] <%dukenux> Z A P
[3:00:47] <Thakan_dar> Witcher 1 is best witcher
[3:00:48] <%MaddyCaddy> Read the books or play 3
[3:00:51] <$RealThiele> witcher 1 & 2 a re super eurojank
[3:00:51] <%Cykron> Yeah you don’t need to feel obligated to play Witcher 1
[3:00:53] <clown_shoes> read the books noob
[3:01:01] <+TekkieX> First Witcher game aged badly, it was never great in the first place sadly.
[3:01:26] <%Theycallmenerf> I don’t know that much about CVX so I’m excited to experience it for the first time.
[3:01:27] <Das_Beergut> They need Henry Cavill to do an audiobook!
[3:01:30] <$RealThiele> we see you and are inspired to do different
[3:01:35] <%jcflyguy> They're vore monsters
[3:01:39] <%Cykron> Lol
[3:01:40] <rytisone> they can eat you whole
[3:01:41] <natebud> RE3 is pretty good.
[3:01:52] <%derekwst3> OSFrog they look just like us
[3:01:53] <%Cykron> Frogs are cool by definition
[3:02:10] <%cowardman93> frogs are bad and should feel bad
[3:02:11] <%dukenux> ENDLESS TRASH
[3:02:13] <%Cykron> I would agree
[3:02:18] <+REDtheBEAST> They best make the Hunter betas even better in REmake3
[3:02:25] <+SharkyKrunk> You see those Hunter-Lickers in that RE2 mod?
[3:02:29] <djazo> hunter in RE outbreak and in RE remake 1 are the best
[3:02:47] <%Cykron> Pay your mortgage and hookers
[3:03:16] <%cowardman93> clearly Machinima was being held up by you
[3:03:18] <%SoFarFetched> huh interesting

[3:03:27] <$joylent_blue> well its something

[3:03:55] <%Cykron> Good one
[3:04:01] <oniwahoo> That's good to know, I still have a lot of old LPs to get through
[3:04:02] <natebud> There's neat things you can do in RE:0 if you split up. Like draw enemies with one character and run past enemies with the other.
[3:04:03] <%Garthunox> well I just watched KOTOR again so I feel good you two got some money out of it
[3:04:05] <%Cykron> Everyone loves rich guy
[3:04:26] <natebud> Eileen is invincible @AngriestPat
[3:04:34] <Kirby_Sauce> cheer500 Pat is my favorite Ojama. now i have to go work till 1 am, then go home and get back in time for my shift starting at noon aftrer that

[3:04:51] <Press_X_ToJASON> pat hates it when people shoot him
[3:04:53] <+Rolandknight> yeah dude she can't die
[3:04:53] <natebud> Health only effects ending
[3:04:59] <indig0bird> She is invincible but if she takes too much damage you get the bad ending
[3:05:01] <%Cykron> It is what it is
[3:05:02] <%cowardman93> I'm watching the old DS2 now, gotta remind woolie to drop his shield
[3:05:04] <spongeofmystery> Eileen not invincible, damage she takes affects how quickly she walks into the Event Horizon machine
[3:05:13] <%Cykron> She totally isn’t
[3:05:16] <rytisone> Konami should also start making Silent Hill remakes
[3:05:18] <%rumtumtugnutz> Just becauuse she can't die that doesn't mean she's immortal
