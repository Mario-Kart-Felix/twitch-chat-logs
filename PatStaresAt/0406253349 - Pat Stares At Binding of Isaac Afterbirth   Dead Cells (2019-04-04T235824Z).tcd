[0:07:21] <%dukenux> It's not about too much sanitizer, but using it too frequently

[0:08:36] <Koopardon> I'm always really super worried that I'm still asleep and late from something while I'm actually awake and at said thing
[0:08:36] <%AncelDeLambert> wow, imagine if they had LAUNCHED with that
[0:08:36] <%sshen> It doesnt even have a cart
[0:08:36] <Jugg4n4ut> truly the future
[0:08:39] <sir_nack> @zedravan it's literally spyware in the exact same ways steam is
[0:08:40] <%quitecross> ten cent aren't to be trusted
[0:08:43] <Intolerable> @oAznoUta fuckin christ
[0:08:44] <$valriot> What a shock, new software improves, what a NOVEL CONCEPT
[0:08:46] <VRNK> ???
[0:08:48] <%Gatzarlok> Great... Another shitty steam.
[0:08:49] <MichaelOGCleaver> wow what a bad store
[0:08:51] <scrumbotime> Make You Internet Surf
[0:08:51] <+SimplyPandaz> Even if its not spyware its still anti consumer
[0:08:51] <%joylent_blue> i just died on floor 101 of BP as V for the SECOND TIME IN A ROW..... FUCK
[0:08:53] <%Gatzarlok> Just what we needed
[0:08:53] <sir_nack> if you wanna call steam spyware, that is
[0:08:55] <%cvp5127> refunds TBD LUL
[0:09:02] <%Halowood> It does still scan your local steam profile data without permission, it just won't send it (they claim) until you import friends
[0:09:02] <%spiritofmojave> Ten Cent tho
[0:09:03] <00ichi00> Ok I’m switching to my tv for this stream
[0:09:03] <%konekoryugamine> At least it's not doing anything insane.
[0:09:09] <%crimsonharvest> it passed the first expert sniff test
[0:09:11] <%GrayMatterMiner> reviews are still allowable by the dev
[0:09:13] <%sshen> This store is on par with 2004 steam and that was a mess
[0:09:16] <DXLelouch24> security still sucks tho, and no steam wallet equivalent, do that then we'll talk
[0:09:19] <%StatistX> I wouldn't mind the epic game store as much, if it didn't want me to re-authorize, cause i have a new PC and took HOURS to send the authentification e-mail
[0:09:19] <CptBritches> Now I will buy everything on it because it is meeting bare minimums!
[0:09:20] <%dukenux> I'm still iffy about tencent but eh
[0:09:21] <+logoth_> Opt in reviews are bullshit.
[0:09:21] <Nina96> @AngriestPat is it better than origin?
[0:09:25] <Jugg4n4ut> the refund test?
[0:09:27] <%terminallyCapriciousz> the only bad thing about EGS is that they're paying devs to make a storefront.
[0:09:28] <%dukenux> Im so far just use it for freebies
[0:09:30] <%konekoryugamine> Oh wow Steam was a thing in 2004?
[0:09:33] <%AppleBasket> AppleBasket subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! pat you are cool, don't let the liquid win
[0:09:39] <Dio_TR> don't be xenophobic guys

[0:09:49] <Thalchampz> GOG

[0:09:51] <Solidus_113> GoG Galaxy?
[0:09:51] <%dukenux> ***
[0:09:53] <%konekoryugamine> @terminallyCapriciousz Dude I fucking love your username and you and I should both know what it's from and that makes me so happy.
[0:09:59] <%Typhaeon> 🤔
[0:10:00] <%spiritofmojave> GOG should be the true competitor for Steam
[0:10:01] <dsauce999> *smacks lips*
[0:10:04] <Jugg4n4ut> GoG Galaxy is ok
[0:10:07] <%sshen> Steam launched in 2003 yeah
[0:10:09] <%konekoryugamine> @GohanEgret Wow that is a bit of a good and bad move.
[0:10:21] <$valriot> Yeah people forget Steam is fucking 15 years old and EGS is what like...barely a year?
[0:10:23] <%terminallyCapriciousz> @konekoryugamine One of the few who gets my name and doesn't hate me. Welcome to the dark carnival bro ;)

[0:10:40] <gustavozxd> i bought assassins creed 2 on steam and i can't even start the game
[0:10:44] <%spiritofmojave> Uplay for Assassain's Creed stuff was o o f
[0:10:45] <Jugg4n4ut> the windows store failed ALOT of tests
[0:10:48] <%VanaSkiller> LUL
[0:10:48] <%ElenaManetta> This doesn't like a Pat test, this sounds like a basic requirement for a program...

[0:11:08] <alrobot2014> hows it feeeeel to be a bitch
[0:11:10] <%konekoryugamine> UPlay kind of sucks.
[0:11:13] <DatAsuna> Uplay stole my splinter cell copy!
[0:11:16] <%sshen> That was just arkham knight PC version
[0:11:16] <%dukenux> And yeah, Ubishop aint the best either
[0:11:16] <%Typhaeon> What are you, TierZoo now?
[0:11:17] <%ElenaManetta> Steam #1
[0:11:17] <CptBritches> Bill Gates personally calls you a bitch and insults your mother sometimes when you try to launch a game
[0:11:19] <%ElenaManetta> YEAH
[0:11:20] <%dukenux> Origin is a big meh
[0:11:21] <+Codeblue666> origin lasty
[0:11:22] <%konekoryugamine> See? UPlay sicks.
[0:11:24] <DatAsuna> Uplay literally took away a game I alredy bought
[0:11:24] <%konekoryugamine> SUCKS.
[0:11:26] <%ElenaManetta> WHOO
[0:11:27] <%riantDeliration> DRM free is niceee
[0:11:31] <DatAsuna> Out of my library
[0:11:34] <%AncelDeLambert> man, it was a trip to find out that the Assassins Creed games were all crashing to desktop for me because Uplay was throwing a shitfit about my internet dying
[0:11:37] <%crimsonharvest> 3's probably like itch?
[0:11:39] <%ElenaManetta> Windows Live
[0:11:40] <%dukenux> As a pure technical launcher. Blizzard's a good one
[0:11:41] <DatAsuna> Don't say uplay
[0:11:41] <%sshen> Discord store
[0:11:41] <%mercado94> torrents Kappa
[0:11:41] <%GrayMatterMiner> gog actually isnt that bad
[0:11:42] <AdjathaTheDrinker> @StatistX Get more friends! It's sweet and they've got an expansion coming out like next year?
[0:11:45] <%laserbeaming> DRM Free makes GoG #1 to me
[0:11:46] <%konekoryugamine> Mean, PSN isn't that great, either
[0:11:46] <weontheultralightbeam> D:
[0:11:50] <%spiritofmojave> BOOO
[0:11:53] <Jugg4n4ut> The discord store
[0:11:56] <%GohanEgret> @konekoryugamine whoops my mistake, steam launched in 2003 and not with HL2
[0:11:57] <MichaelOGCleaver> PogChamp
[0:11:58] <%dukenux> what about Blizzard's
[0:11:59] <$Valdorick> Counter point - Discord's Store #3
[0:12:01] <%GrayMatterMiner> yeah, what about the discord store
[0:12:02] <+Mvrdok_> LUL
[0:12:03] <DatAsuna> fuck uplay
[0:12:03] <%MaximumDaximum> There's a power gap between all these rankings though
[0:12:03] <Nina96> @AngriestPat steam has some regulation issues for what appears on the store
[0:12:03] <%BonewheelVanguard> apatBig depression time
[0:12:03] <%joylent_blue> shopping cart is a longterm goal you guys :)
[0:12:05] <Jugg4n4ut> totally forgot that exists
[0:12:05] <VRNK> LUL
[0:12:08] <SchlongKongEduardo> Jebaited Jebaited Jebaited
[0:12:09] <NickHatesSnow> Blizzard is above Uplay
[0:12:09] <%AncelDeLambert> they have ADS?!
[0:12:09] <%sshen> It has 5 features hard to make them not work
[0:12:10] <starotter70> YEAH
[0:12:10] <Darren716> Yeah where does battle net rank?
[0:12:12] <%GrayMatterMiner> wait WHAT
[0:12:12] <%Ascethetic> what about battle net?
[0:12:12] <%ElenaManetta> Just like good ol' Telltale.
[0:12:12] <alrobot2014> IM SORRY WHAT
[0:12:12] <%StatistX> @AdjathaTheDrinker I have already issues with finding people to play boardgames and such and it would be even harder to find some that have no issue with english, living in a german speaking country ^^
[0:12:13] <%Gatzarlok> Uplay allows you to go through steam for R6 so...
[0:12:13] <DatAsuna> @AngriestPat Uplay stole my game retroactively
[0:12:13] <%AncelDeLambert> fuck you, Uplay, my god
[0:12:14] <%Skrypto> Skrypto subscribed at Tier 2. They've subscribed for 4 months, currently on a 4 month streak! 4 months. Sup.
[0:12:15] <energywarning> steam used to do that
[0:12:15] <Jugg4n4ut> wooooow
[0:12:17] <$Sayie> Wait Uplay does that? The fuck?
[0:12:17] <%konekoryugamine> @GohanEgret Either way, that is not a good idea, but I can see what they were trying to do
[0:12:19] <%dukenux> AAAAAADS
[0:12:20] <%spiritofmojave> Fucking brilliant
[0:12:26] <%konekoryugamine> Ads or AIDS?
[0:12:27] <%laserbeaming> That never happened to me D:
[0:12:30] <MichaelOGCleaver> fantastic
[0:12:31] <+DannyBucko231> How gross LUL
[0:12:33] <DatAsuna> @AngriestPat Have you seen how bad the Ads are on the bethesda launcher?
[0:12:33] <SchlongKongEduardo> PogChamp marketing geniuses
[0:12:35] <%AncelDeLambert> at least Steam only does that when you launch the BROWSER
[0:12:37] <VRNK> ｆｕｔｕｕｕｕｕｒｅ
[0:12:37] <%FoulNightingale> This is why I pirate shit.
[0:12:37] <%HuskyGreene> waow
[0:12:40] <gustavozxd> far cry: trying to make a good villain since far cry 3
[0:12:41] <%joylent_blue> yeah uplay gave me AIDS
[0:12:41] <%dukenux> @konekoryugamine yes
[0:12:42] <+scotty_jd> Then it calls you a bitch
[0:12:43] <OneShotZombie> steam sort of does that they just call it news. (and you can opt out)
[0:12:44] <%konekoryugamine> Legit, I can't tell if he said "ads" or "AIDS"
[0:12:46] <%cvp5127> aarrgh
[0:12:48] <Storm_Samurai> @FoulNightingale hallelujah
[0:12:51] <VRNK> FUCK EA
[0:12:51] <%GrayMatterMiner> how do you even really get worse than that
[0:12:51] <%konekoryugamine> I think I'm going deaf from my allergies.
[0:12:52] <%StatistX> I'd rather get AIDS than ADS, cause with the first I enjoyed the fucking beforehand Kappa
[0:12:54] <gustavozxd> @konekoryugamine same thing tbh
[0:12:54] <SilverFaustX> trash
[0:12:55] <%ElenaManetta> @AngriestPat Is that much different than when Steam has pop-ups when you start up the program saying HEY!! THIS GAME IS OUT or SOME RANDOM GAME IS ON SALE ?
[0:12:57] <NickHatesSnow> No Blizzard?
[0:12:57] <DatAsuna> The bethesda launcher puts the ads IN YOUR GAME LIBRARY
[0:13:03] <%dukenux> i honestly place ubistore below origin
[0:13:07] <%MaximumDaximum> Origin is the only reason I haven't tried Apex Legends
[0:13:08] <%Supertoaster02> I think the shit thing about Epic is steam oh so needed a kick in the ass but the Epic launcher is oh so clearly just tossed out the door incomplete with fuck you money
[0:13:09] <%dukenux> though i haven't used it lately
[0:13:09] <bobbenxd> Steam > Battlenet > GOG
[0:13:15] <DatAsuna> Bethesda just says FUCK YOU, PREORDER RAGE 2 in the middle of your games list
[0:13:16] <helpmeimafruit> Would you call it the apex of bad clients? Kappa
[0:13:19] <%Laecerelius> Origin is super trash
[0:13:20] <alrobot2014> i've had to reinstall origin multiple times to play me3
[0:13:24] <%sshen> EGS lied about how much metro sold. They compared it to last light which sold 20k on steam instead of the one that sold 1.5mil
[0:13:29] <+boriss96> Battlenet is ok
[0:13:34] <%konekoryugamine> What if I DON'T want to preorder Rage 2 because I'm broke?
[0:13:35] <%sshen> 1 and a half mil even
[0:13:36] <Finaldragoon> Don't forget when the Anthem stress test LITERALLY BROKE ORIGIN
[0:13:37] <%dukenux> GoG > Steam > Bnet
[0:13:37] <energywarning> oh yeah, the windows store
[0:13:41] <starotter70> That's a thing?
[0:13:42] <DatAsuna> @AngriestPat Bethesda launcher is worse than windows
[0:13:42] <%spiritofmojave> the what store?
[0:13:45] <%dukenux> Is windows store even alive?
[0:13:45] <SchlongKongEduardo> Killer Instinct LUL :(
[0:13:47] <+BigBruthaThunda> dude fuck the windows store
[0:13:48] <dsauce999> I only use the bethesda store for the creation kit, helps with cleaning mods
[0:13:50] <%StatistX> God, that windows store...bought a game and then had to fiddle around with deep windows settings to even be able to download without an error. then after an update, I had to do that again
[0:13:51] <gustavozxd> the ps4 version of the ps store is kinda awful at least in brazil
[0:13:51] <%mercado94> windows has a store???
[0:13:53] <StaticSunrise> remember when the windows store had like 20 people playing CoD at once?
[0:13:54] <%konekoryugamine> Windows has a store?
[0:13:54] <$Sayie> The Windows store is just.... no. I tried playing Ark through it and it just doesn't even launch the game half the time
[0:13:58] <Nina96> @AngriestPat theres a windows store?
[0:14:02] <SilverFaustX> epic has 4 games
[0:14:03] <%Gatzarlok> I'm just sick of having my games all over the place. Just fucking put it on steam you fucks.
[0:14:06] <%dukenux> Hey now, Pat, Bnet has like 6 games! maybe 7...
[0:14:10] <%cvp5127> neat
[0:14:12] <%Docblargle> inb4 discord only has 4 games
[0:14:12] <%Ascethetic> @AngriestPat rank the launchers
[0:14:14] <DatAsuna> Bethesda launcher is the grossest
[0:14:15] <%joylent_blue> i completely forgot Bethesda even HAD launcher
[0:14:16] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> Yeah, probably not
[0:14:20] <DatAsuna> I already own dishonored
[0:14:22] <+scotty_jd> Bunti Box > Steam
[0:14:25] <DatAsuna> stop trying to make me buy dishonored
[0:14:28] <Dzikka> it just WORKS
[0:14:28] <%StatistX> I also don't give a shit about discord store
[0:14:29] <%trillmagical> Bethesd OMEGALUL
[0:14:31] <HopelesSoul7> Bethesda seal of approval LUL
[0:14:32] <%ElenaManetta> It's like "Have all TV shows on one network"
[0:14:37] <%GohanEgret> you should want direct downloads not just steam
[0:14:38] <%konekoryugamine> Yep, and American laws ban monopolies of any kind.
[0:14:39] <Mr_Strut> YAR
[0:14:40] <starotter70> Yar

[0:14:49] <%GrayMatterMiner> yes
[0:14:49] <Nina96> @AngriestPat u gonna try stadia?
[0:14:50] <Storm_Samurai> yarrrrrrrrrrrr
[0:14:50] <%ElenaManetta> It doesn't take much effort to open a program.
[0:14:51] <Malziel> But also: monopolies are BAD
[0:14:51] <%some_random_variable> argh
[0:14:51] <%El_Desperad0> thieves?
[0:14:53] <Psyramics> it is like 12 years too old for a real steam competitor to emerge
[0:14:55] <suikudo> Guess what fuckers
[0:14:56] <%riantDeliration> man i cant believe piratebay was years ago
[0:14:56] <eagerdigger> Let's sail the digital seas, laddies
[0:14:57] <%konekoryugamine> The actual fuck is Stadia?
[0:14:58] <%spiritofmojave> Yeyeye thievery
[0:15:01] <+mahler2> What’s the deal with anthem and BioWare this week, I’ve seen rumblings on Reddit
[0:15:01] <Jugg4n4ut> yaarrrree me mateys
[0:15:02] <+shadezzzz> are you ready for pirate game launchers where you double click to torrent?
[0:15:03] <$MajorCrasher> guys guys, did you know you can just take the fucking exe files and put them on Steam?
[0:15:04] <+dudecool61> No way, it takes way more effort to pirate something
[0:15:05] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Yo ho ho. AND? a bottle of rum
[0:15:06] <alphapneumatic> logic and facts
[0:15:07] <sir_nack> same lol
[0:15:08] <%konekoryugamine> Got some fucking PIrates in chat today
[0:15:09] <%skizzuto> what about twitch's launcher?
[0:15:11] <%templar010> nope
[0:15:12] <suikudo> If it comes out on the epic games store you bet your ass im puting my pirate hat on
[0:15:21] <%sshen> Steam workshop will keep steam #1 forever
[0:15:21] <alphapneumatic> do it
[0:15:22] <%GrayMatterMiner> fair enough
[0:15:22] <+Kavtech> That's fair.
[0:15:22] <gustavozxd> damn LUL
[0:15:23] <+Shotgundam009> shrugs
[0:15:23] <%Niney_Who> I'm not dealing with the shitty security
[0:15:23] <Croetec> or you can wait and have standards?
[0:15:24] <%El_Desperad0> really
[0:15:25] <DXLelouch24> but Pat the security sucks
[0:15:26] <%Shadowthedigger> Sorry Pat, I won't be watching you stream them then.
[0:15:26] <gruff_gridof> yovgLUL
[0:15:27] <%konekoryugamine> Ah who am I kidding, I did it with P2
[0:15:28] <$valriot> EGS is at least aiming to be proactive, and give more money to indie devs and publishers
[0:15:28] <%dukenux> Steam allowed me to play "Minerva's Den" with a non steam copy of Bioshock 2, so that's neat i guess
[0:15:30] <%arancet> no, between security issues and shitty business practices, i'm NOT dealing with epic
[0:15:30] <gustavozxd> i usually buy the console version anyway
[0:15:31] <%mercado94> yo ho yo ho a pirate's life!~
[0:15:32] <%ElenaManetta> It's a very minor hassle in comparison to missing out for a game entirely for it.
[0:15:32] <%cvp5127> LUL
[0:15:33] <suikudo> Im gonna fucking do it
[0:15:34] <%meltdown547> Don't give Epic a cent.
[0:15:34] <alphapneumatic> do it so we dont have to
[0:15:35] <TwinBat> we all knew you'd give in because big pc numbers
[0:15:35] <%konekoryugamine> But we all do it.
[0:15:37] <%GohanEgret> BIG ELMO WINK apatWink
[0:15:37] <Malziel> LUL
[0:15:37] <%Shadowthedigger> I refuse to even think about those games now.
[0:15:37] <kingra> FUCK YEAH PIRACY
[0:15:37] <%Gatzarlok> Don't give in! I feels it's putting a bad precedent for future companies making deals like that
[0:15:38] <Mr_Strut> ~wink~
[0:15:38] <AdjathaTheDrinker> Yar
[0:15:39] <%FoulNightingale> HOWEVER
[0:15:39] <ssmotzer> Just stream the games on the Google Stadia
[0:15:40] <Intolerable> PIRACY#1
[0:15:40] <helpmeimafruit> Epic Games more like Epically Lames haha I'm the best
[0:15:41] <Nina96> *wink*
[0:15:41] <%spiritofmojave> it's still gonna happen
[0:15:41] <DXLelouch24> i don't want you to lose your ibfo
[0:15:41] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> R-) R-) R-)
[0:15:42] <DomunDomunDomun> Don't buy it either way.
[0:15:42] <Ion_Laser> Kappa

[0:27:50] <AMajorTom> I was prepared for it to be way worse than it was, so your milage may vary.
[0:27:51] <%badchoice5> @AngriestPat There was this seaweed crap they stuffed my sockets with when the painkillers didn't work, and that helped A LOT

[0:30:02] <jubejube56> that is an rpg analogy if I ever heard it

[0:31:41] <%spiritofmojave> cOnSuMaBlE
[0:31:42] <%salty_syd913> ki points are just ammo
[0:31:42] <+thebonebard> oh no consumeable magic
[0:31:43] <%BigNerdSam> Brain Goblins Activate!
[0:31:43] <$Mendin> FF1 and FF2 also had Vancian Spellcasting, I think
[0:31:43] <%BobaFetish2124> What's this nerd sh*t
[0:31:44] <%skizzuto> but what if you need them later
[0:31:44] <%TenderBabyBacon> and pat loves consumable items
[0:31:45] <%dukenux> C-CONSUMABLE
[0:31:45] <aceofspades627> make pat cry~
[0:31:46] <%Trinity5> so is this the consumable items arc
[0:31:46] <$MajorCrasher> LUL
[0:31:47] <%brickwall35> Pat's right though
[0:31:47] <+BigBruthaThunda> Pat the wizard, who never casted a single spell
[0:31:47] <%Gatzarlok> What... do you just forget it until you sleep? Does casting magic make you stupid?
[0:31:48] <+decisivelynameless> I'm glad they basically turned it into MP in 5e
[0:31:48] <Thirtine> consumable spells are awful if thyre the only alternative
[0:31:49] <+Th3SmartAlec> Pat, did you know Red Bulls are consumable?
[0:31:52] <a_mad_dragon> this is why sorcerers are better than wizards
[0:31:55] <%dukenux> yEYEYE
[0:31:56] <@JustinianKnight> many games have that system
[0:31:56] <%Laecerelius> only real change is you can burn higher spells slots on lower level spells
[0:31:57] <%konekoryugamine> Damn right.
[0:31:58] <%GohanEgret> w o o
[0:31:58] <$HentaiSenpai9K> I'm going to see it Tomorrow

[0:32:02] <%laserbeaming> How did you play Pillars then? Did you just avoid wizards? @AngriestPat
[0:32:03] <AdjathaTheDrinker> Anybody read the "Coldfire Trilogy"? That had a neat Magic system. Basically microshopic alien lifeforms in the air that respond to mental impulses, allowing skilled people to create 'magic-like' effects
[0:32:04] <+matrixManipulator> It's fine on tabletop with a DM but it doesn't translate well to vidya games
[0:32:05] <SilverFaustX> Alien

[1:02:04] <%mercado94> did you beat satan?

[1:02:10] <prophetdisharmonious> which version of mom
[1:02:14] <%lewdskeletor13> Pat is literally just repeating Paige’s catchphrases at this point

[1:08:49] <%Ascethetic> wait till you get to the boss
[1:08:50] <$jobbedbone> no gay for pay
[1:08:51] <aimlesshealer> the endless knockback makes it hard to do reliable damage
[1:08:51] <prophetdisharmonious> Just wait till he switches his toon against the boss
[1:08:51] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@Intolerable) (warning)
[1:08:54] <rosemon5001> @AngriestPat you usually take it only if you have atleast 4 or 5 damage ups
[1:08:54] <soraabora> this is what all isaac players must go through
[1:08:57] <%mercado94> BLUE ROCK TIME
[1:08:58] <acedeone> your tears also put our your fires lol
[1:09:03] <soraabora> this seperates the men from the babies
[1:09:04] <kakdela7> secret to the right

[1:09:18] <AdjathaTheDrinker> Pray. For. Mojo.
[1:09:20] <%shiplord13> right
[1:09:20] <Koopardon> Now let's hope for Libra
[1:09:21] <acedeone> chance more bombs in chests
[1:09:22] <$spardanwarrior> The splitting tears from Cricket's Body helps make up for the loss of damage
[1:09:23] <+MonsieurHedge> there's an x rock on right
[1:09:24] <straight_up_garbage> do it if you get another bomb
[1:09:24] <%Laecerelius> near chest

[1:09:26] <reonome> your tears put out your fire LUL

[1:31:09] <00ichi00> I can't believe i never got into this game
[1:31:09] <ssmotzer> The unkillable Pat
[1:31:11] <mar_krow> U need red hearts now
[1:31:11] <%shiplord13> One of the most useful items
[1:31:12] <%mercado94> @AngriestPat you're playing Nier now
[1:31:14] <Finakala> Mom's Heart/It Lives is now the easiest boss in the game
[1:31:19] <%dukenux> oh my god, this upgrades' SO good
[1:31:20] <$Mendin> Black hearts are soul hearts that proc the Necronomicon when depleted
[1:31:21] <%brickwall35> I love how Pat installs a mod to tell him what items do and he still doesn't read LUL
[1:31:21] <%GeneralSCPatton> cheer500 The pills are a key part of many infinite combos to break the game. 48 Hour energy recharges item and spawns 2 batteries. Placebo is a rechargable item that duplicates your held pill. Combine infinite batteries with any stat up pill.
[1:31:21] <+MonsieurHedge> becomes as gods
[1:31:21] <%Ilpala> broken as hell
[1:31:23] <lloyddboy> OVERCONFlDENCE IS A SLOW AND INSIDIOUS KILLER
[1:31:26] <+TDotGoat> you could always just shoot
[1:31:27] <%edwardskacz> Soy Milk + Lost Contact. Two awful tastes that taste great together
[1:31:28] <%ECRead> Pat has become FUCKING INVINCIBLE
[1:31:28] <%shiplord13> Well mom can still wreck u
[1:31:30] <turf_wind_and_fire> He's gonna get killed in a second from just shooting, isn't he?
[1:31:31] <%furiousfurioso> I can't believe Pat got a good soy build goin
[1:31:33] <ssmotzer> Soy ftw
[1:31:33] <00ichi00> Ie the switch
[1:31:35] <reonome> nearly crazy talked lol
[1:31:35] <CuttleCrow> its all fun and games until the lasers come out
[1:31:37] <Finakala> Lost Contact is always good though
[1:31:38] <+thebonebard> crazy talk gave a tease there
[1:31:38] <$CarlosEoM> invinciblessed
[1:31:40] <%dukenux> Legendary Poop Knight, Isaac
[1:31:50] <acedeone> this is the most unlikely of timelines
[1:31:52] <%konekoryugamine> How is Pat this good?!
[1:31:55] <+King_floppy> another bomb wall
[1:31:57] <$Mendin> The only thing that can kill Pat now is Pat
[1:31:57] <%konekoryugamine> Does Soy is Power?!
[1:31:57] <Curtis_EB> for some reason im really noticing pat exhaling into the mic
[1:31:59] <aimlesshealer> @Finakala Not always, if you have a low fire rate it makes it difficult to hit enemies with a lot of projectiles
[1:32:02] <+CanonHusbando> Watch this muscle memory ruin the next run he has though
[1:32:05] <%shiplord13> Item room
[1:32:06] <%kujofire990> you have to hit it
[1:32:08] <00ichi00> Is the switch Ver the best to get
[1:32:08] <%Laecerelius> no bombs, though
[1:32:10] <$Mendin> Each floor has 2 secret rooms
[1:32:11] <%brickwall35> there's two every floor
[1:32:13] <%furiousfurioso> 2 a floor
[1:32:18] <%serpenttucker> You always have two secret rooms per floor
[1:32:20] <SixthSun2> Gotta bomb that wall @AngriestPat
[1:32:21] <%shiplord13> Two secret rooms on every fkore
[1:32:22] <AdjathaTheDrinker> Pat is playing some kind of Kharmic Chicken, taking soy and being rewarded for his hubris
[1:32:23] <%Laecerelius> there's a secret room and a super secret room
[1:32:24] <+King_floppy> play the slots for a bomb
[1:32:25] <CuttleCrow> you found the secret room, the other one is the super secret room
[1:32:28] <+ABadIdea> if pat dies, does the cat bring him back with all his items?
[1:32:33] <Chester_goes_Berserk> There's a 2nd secret room only connected to one wall
[1:32:33] <GFPPM> There's the normal secret room and then the SUPER secret room
[1:32:38] <SailingSaturn> cirBlind
[1:32:39] <Finakala> He'll come back but with only 1 red heart
[1:32:41] <AdjathaTheDrinker> Yes but only 1 heart, AbadIdea
[1:32:43] <%serpenttucker> @ABadIdea yes
[1:32:44] <CuttleCrow> (the super secret room usually sucks)
[1:32:45] <+LeroyOctopus> pat needs glasses

[1:55:05] <@StridentSong> @AngriestPat Take the Worm Trinket
[1:55:07] <Shortnamer> you literally ran into a bullet
[1:55:08] <ssmotzer> Why is being covered in bullet blocking enemy bouncing tears bad?
[1:55:08] <axelcezar> FOR FU.
[1:55:08] <%Laecerelius> Pat you ran into his tears
[1:55:10] <%konekoryugamine> Take down the sin!
[1:55:15] <aimlesshealer> This is one of the only builds where I WOULD pick up Tiny Planet
[1:55:16] <sayaman012341> Worm can go away, take the planet
[1:55:16] <$Mendin> He has SPLASH, SHIELD, and SUPER RAPID tears, this is lterally the only build that Planet would work with
[1:55:17] <ExemplarKyle> Tiny Planet + Shielded Tears = RIP ALL ENEMY BULLETS
[1:55:17] <+Tokanova> mmm coins
[1:55:19] <$HelghastTroop> so how much of this has pat played?
[1:55:20] <+LeroyOctopus> does pat need glasses? serious question
[1:55:21] <%konekoryugamine> HOW is he this good
[1:55:22] <+YabbaTroll> this is the 1% time where planet is great
[1:55:22] <%afronooch> @ssmotzer hard to actually hit enemies
[1:55:24] <Finakala> Planet and Worm would make you 100% immune to almost anything
[1:55:35] <derap41> Pats been nullifying tears for so long he no longer remembers them
[1:55:38] <%Niney_Who> PAt the creep on the floor
[1:55:40] <%ThePuddingDead> What up Nerds!
[1:55:43] <%Niney_Who> Don't stop in glowing blood
[1:55:43] <AdjathaTheDrinker> You got red on you
[1:55:46] <%spiritofmojave> @LeroyOctopus After last stream I think he needs a metronome, I feel bad jermaPluto
[1:55:47] <%Tucker0603> but his range would be abysmal
[1:55:47] <%galaxyswirl> okay maybe take the planet
[1:55:48] <%GeneralSCPatton> The flashing blood hurts you
[1:55:48] <taggeru> nioo
[1:55:48] <%badchoice5> WHY
[1:55:49] <derap41> but get tiny planet tho
[1:55:49] <acedeone> bomb corpses for coins/items/possibly items @AngriestPat
[1:55:49] <aimlesshealer> Planet will give you a 360 tear shield
[1:55:50] <Zyczenn> No
[1:55:51] <taggeru> WHY
[1:55:54] <reonome> WHY
[1:55:54] <ssmotzer> @afronooch Doesn't matter when you are untouchable
[1:55:55] <%GeneralSCPatton> Planet
[1:55:55] <$Mendin> We were ironically boosting Soy originally but but Unironically Take The Planet

[1:56:09] <Dreigun> you're becoming a bullet hell boss
[1:56:09] <%konekoryugamine> THEN WHY
[1:56:10] <@Moobot> I don't know if I can trust that. (@panic_rabbit) (warning)
[1:56:12] <OneShotZombie> I don't think the planet would really help pat since most his damage comes from walking into things anyway
[1:56:12] <staroftherogue777> dude i love nier automata 4Head
[1:56:13] <%brickwall35> It's much better with shielded tears

[1:56:19] <%Niney_Who> YES
[1:56:19] <%shiplord13> bomb yes
[1:56:21] <@StridentSong> @AngriestPat The Lazy Worm makes it a denser wall of tears, which makes it easier to block incoming projectiles
[1:56:22] <prophetdisharmonious> For everyones information, Tiny Planet changes your orbitals so that you can't fire straight. Instead, they curve around isaac.
[1:56:22] <%brickwall35> pass
[1:56:24] <+LeroyOctopus> yes
[1:56:27] <%Niney_Who> Eeehh nvm
[1:56:27] <Zyczenn> pass
[1:56:27] <mar_krow> Yes
[1:56:28] <derap41> that's also good
[1:56:28] <ssmotzer> Planet
[1:56:28] <%Kataguro> Better?
[1:56:29] <%konekoryugamine> Okay
[1:56:29] <%Niney_Who> Thought it was Tiny Horn

[2:02:20] <%konekoryugamine> So, was anyone else expecting him to be THAT good?
[2:02:20] <KangarooCyborg> Showers are a temporary buff
[2:02:24] <%Xooler67> dab for twitch God pat
[2:02:30] <%konekoryugamine> Nah, he's Soy God now
[2:02:34] <Saltmeisterr> just got here in time for dead cells
[2:02:34] <%konekoryugamine> Pat is now SOY GOD
[2:02:38] <LegendaryDorkKnight> he wasnt that good tbh
[2:02:39] <%nameless_majin> Good thing he’s gonna get started on Dead Cells. Lots of my friends talk about that game so I wanna see what all the fuss is about
[2:02:40] <StaticSunrise> what did I just miss
[2:02:40] <%Cthulos> apatDab apatDab apatDab apatDab apatDab sipsipDab sipsipDab sipsipDab sipsipDab sipsipDab sipsipDab
[2:02:41] <starotter70> He's not watching, now's the time to revolt
[2:02:42] <%spiritofmojave> apatDab apatDab apatDab
[2:02:46] <aimlesshealer> He didn't become soy god. He never got the planet.
[2:02:48] <StaticSunrise> did he win?
[2:02:50] <%schlager087> Did he ever end up figuring out Risk of Rain?
[2:02:53] <%konekoryugamine> No
[2:02:55] <%Solidnick18> SourPls
[2:02:56] <%Cthulos> apatDab sipsipDab apatDab sipsipDab apatDab sipsipDab
[2:02:56] <BaronVonDickButt> dead cell sis ok i guess
[2:02:56] <%ClutchRoadagain> he won, against all odds
[2:02:58] <Saltmeisterr> is pat playing on pc?
[2:03:00] <%ClutchRoadagain> but then he didn't because mods
[2:03:03] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> apatDab apatDab apatDab
[2:03:04] <%Cthulos> sipsipDab apatDab sipsipDab apatDab sipsipDab apatDab
[2:03:04] <flubber3d> He did well on drizzle
[2:03:05] <Saltmeisterr> for dead cells
[2:03:08] <%Solidnick18> apatDab
[2:03:15] <WinstonFromUndertale> Is he comin back on?
[2:03:15] <%konekoryugamine> Which means the Mod God beat the Soy God into the ground
[2:03:17] <hussdogrob> @konekoryugamine mods really trivialize it and he has definitely played a bit before today of isaac
[2:03:18] <+Kang_Artur> SourPls
[2:03:24] <aimlesshealer> @ClutchRoadagain Truly a victory worthy of Pat
[2:03:27] <%schlager087> Word word, can't blame him, that game is weird when you first start out
[2:03:27] <Saltmeisterr> bum bum bum
[2:03:39] <%GeneralSCPatton> cheer500 Isaac is very feast or famine. You gotta take chances and invest in things that might get you a sweet synergy or an infinite combo. I've had runs where I was able to spend hours spawning infinite chests on 1 floor and got basically EVERYTHING.
[2:03:42] <%Xooler67> twitch daddy paddy will always prevail
[2:03:44] <%konekoryugamine> Dude I fucking love this track
[2:03:49] <+ForteBlade> wubwubwub
[2:03:49] <BaronVonDickButt> PSA: Remember kids cheaters never get cool shit
[2:03:52] <%ClutchRoadagain> This feels like something out of a fucking sitcom tbh
[2:03:55] <+Twistedknerv> !uptime
[2:03:55] <%Solidnick18> what track is this?
[2:03:55] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 3m.
[2:04:08] <%Xooler67> dab for atonement
[2:04:10] <%joylent_blue> Bootloop by Fingers
[2:04:10] <%Hammerknife> as soon as gungeon came out i dropped isaac for it pretty hard. i think gungeon does everything isaac does better
[2:04:15] <%Xooler67> apatDab apatDab apatDab
[2:04:19] <CuttleCrow> isaac is best played without mods or the wiki at first, but yeah, its ok to use it later on once you're gotten past the gimmicks
[2:04:34] <Saltmeisterr> bootloop sounds like a cereal
[2:04:40] <%lewdskeletor13> Is he done with Isaac?
[2:04:41] <%joylent_blue> or F1NG3RS i guess
[2:04:41] <%ClutchRoadagain> I actually enjoy Dead Cells much, much more than Isaac & Gungeon
[2:04:45] <hussdogrob> @hammerknife agreed gungeon definitely does it better
[2:04:54] <BaronVonDickButt> Like the Lucio-Ohs i saw at target today
[2:04:56] <%ClutchRoadagain> Also, didn't like Risk of Rain.
[2:04:59] <Finakala> Gungeon is super good
[2:05:04] <Saltmeisterr> i hate gungeon's item system
[2:05:07] <+RainShott> Pat said a couple of minutes
[2:05:08] <+RainShott> Pat lied
[2:05:08] <%Hammerknife> dead cells is a different type of roguelike than gungeon or isaac
[2:05:18] <mattmanj17> !uptime
[2:05:18] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 5m.
[2:05:30] <%ClutchRoadagain> Maybe i just need to dedicate more time to it, but Gungeon didn't click in my brain.
[2:05:31] <CuttleCrow> isaac is one of my favorite roguelikes of all time
[2:05:31] <%deviljhojho94> !uptime
[2:05:33] <Seitine> I mean if the person likes it more with mods, then it's not played best without them for that particular person.
[2:05:33] <Saltmeisterr> i don't like being force to play trash gimmick weapons
[2:05:34] <Ir_ramble> shooty shooty Thursday?

[2:06:02] <SubjectX07x> The vast majority of guns are not gimmick weapons tho.
[2:06:05] <%nameless_majin> Sorry for panicking NotLikeThis
[2:06:05] <%Hammerknife> dead cells has a lot more combat finesse. gungeon and isaac are both still twin stick shooters
[2:06:10] <randallboone1> Vampire Masquerade???
[2:06:20] <Ion_Laser> @randallboone1 that's tomorrow
[2:06:20] <+RainShott> Is it just me or is Pat muted? I can only hear the music
[2:06:23] <%lewdskeletor13> @randallboone1 Read the title
[2:06:25] <hussdogrob> @clutchroadagain I've bounced off gungeon once or twice myself but I recently went back and have since killed a couple pasts it's just practice
[2:06:33] <Smaenus> Wait did Pat just start or is this a break, I just woke up lol

[2:06:48] <randallboone1> @ion_laser Rad!
[2:06:52] <%Hammerknife> @hussdogrob a lot of people were turned off by the launch difficulty. gungeon had a patch about a year ago that nerfed the difficulty super hard
[2:06:56] <Finakala> Yeah I've beaten all pasts and it's generally real fun

[2:15:55] <%Typhaeon> As in Dark Souls messages
[2:15:55] <%Hammerknife> the comments swell as a result of botulism @AngriestPat
[2:15:56] <%joylent_blue> the non-chicken comments are premade

[2:15:57] <%afronooch> BOOOOO

[2:17:55] <Teenerb> pickme
[2:17:55] <~AngriestPat> ---- @TheSpiritof2277 has become Captain Chicken! They can type "heal", "potion", "life" to heal the hero, "noheal" to reject a healing request or "resign" to chicken... out... of being Captain Chicken. Last but not least, they can write "@angriestpat" before their messages in chat to make Captain Chicken speak in-game!

[2:32:42] <ballz0steel_> gitgud
[2:32:42] <~AngriestPat> ---- @Finchit has become Captain Chicken! They can type "heal", "potion", "life" to heal the hero, "noheal" to reject a healing request or "resign" to chicken... out... of being Captain Chicken. Last but not least, they can write "@angriestpat" before their messages in chat to make Captain Chicken speak in-game!

[3:35:53] <%Kirby_Sauce> cheer500 whenever I see people support makoto from p5 on Twitter, I would link an animatic of Pat and Woolie's legendary debate on how makoto sucks because Sae exists. Unfortunately the video can no longer be found on YouTube, and I'm not even sure who made it or why it went away. I've been forced to link to copies of the video on some weird Chinese video site. Also, did Pat do any of the JoJo mods for Isaac? If not why? And also when will you correct this mistake

[4:25:58] <%goose_attack_almanac> @AngriestPat It's a new feature apparently with a recentish update. Added new zones and enemies and items. Rebalanced weapons, noticed that the Nutcracker stuns in general instead of just above 50% health enemies. Gotta soul-fund outfits and equip them. No stat differences I think.
