[0:01:21] <%SovPho> D8w8jiv
[0:01:24] <1matheuw> i think he tried but got a stronk from looking at the skill tree
[0:01:44] <%JoshManVGH> So how much bagging on ActiBlizzSoft is permitted in this stream for reasons?
[0:01:47] <%Ixiah> so hes weak psaGoblin
[0:01:52] <Diablo169> I mean, I'm happy Pat's getting paid. But what a weird sponsor? Does he play the game at all? :D

[0:02:37] <%holydeviant1> holydeviant1 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 21 months! I love Path of Exile, but haven't played in years. I hope melee gets more focus, they never manage to make it comparable to "lol nuke the whole screen" tech

[0:02:55] <1matheuw> ill keep both the tabs open for the hell of it

[0:03:29] <%holydeviant1> @Ixiah The real endgame is who can lose the most frames
[0:03:39] <%JoshManVGH> @ixiah I thought that was the whole endgame for all Diablo bases games.
[0:03:43] <+Fefe41> Ok what's with the threesome that I did not ask for
[0:03:46] <Diablo169> Paige has a small silly surprise. Get hyped

[0:11:06] <%KineticZen> Next stream sponsored by Greggs, funny enough
[0:11:38] <Etymorphic> I genuinely think Pat would enjoy PoE if he put the kind of time in that he did learning Kingmaker
[0:11:46] <%NitronStreams> NitronStreams subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 18 months! Watching this while mashing f5 on amazon trying to get an rtx 3050 with out getting massively ripped off. Wish me luck!
[0:12:10] <%KineticZen> Just put yourself on the EVGA waitlist for a better card my man
[0:12:30] <%holydeviant1> @Etymorphic PoE has this weird arc where you go from confused, to feeling OP, to realizing you are useless unless you use a netbuild
[0:12:43] <%KineticZen> It's not on our end
[0:12:45] <+Woronov> JESUS

[0:14:14] <BooitsDock> we can hear your through page stream
[0:14:30] <%Ne1son> Watching both of these at the same time is amazing
[0:14:33] <%KeiganOfAstora> This is hilarous
[0:14:34] <1matheuw> is gregg finally back
[0:14:35] <+zevitunez> Show us the burgers
[0:14:39] <%KeiganOfAstora> I hear you on yours and her on hers. The timing is perfect
[0:14:42] <cartakus> Peach is doing alright?
[0:14:44] <%holydeviant1> I have two monitors and Pat happens to be on the bottom and Pauge on the top one
[0:14:45] <moonmintparadise> oh god they are not in sync for me and paige just started screaming like 10 seconds before you did lmao
[0:14:50] <%Broand> Man I'm watching both and it's well timed
[0:14:52] <%holydeviant1> that whole bit worked really wekk just for me
[0:14:53] <%KineticZen> D:
[0:15:03] <%chance_h> Greg Iâ€™m from the future, youâ€™re going to transform into a goblin named PastaRat
[0:15:08] <redgraverr> path of exile is a pretty good game, I recommend anyone to try it out.
[0:15:15] <%baka_sugoi> Zangif didn't get the sponsor   csbeastSetIn

[0:15:43] <KenzBurp> i need a multitwitch for maximum entertainment oh shit
[0:15:47] <xXVeggiePLusXx> PoE is on Ps4 right?
[0:15:55] <%Broand> I have a lemongrass/lemonbalm tea so I'm lemony
[0:16:05] <redgraverr> @xxveggieplusxx I think it is
[0:16:12] <+Woronov> BEX does amzing work
[0:16:13] <1matheuw> yea is nice
[0:16:25] <cartakus> I forget that PoE 2 is being made and every time it shows up I'm like "hey that is pretty good"
[0:16:28] <Necnill> There it is
[0:16:29] <%Broand> PoE social media management is about as good as warframes
[0:16:38] <%Bailey__Gaming> gunna be switchin between you and Paige :) Ive never really caught up with POE will this update be a good place to jump in?
[0:16:43] <+Birthright_Redux> Do you play PoE? I was surprised to see you were covering the event. Maybe I'm just out of touch
[0:16:55] <%Broand> Announced years ago*
[0:16:56] <%Ixiah> Pat will love POE , so many OP builds, start with the streamer build, necromancer with skellies will kill everything while you chat
[0:17:02] <jeppeww> @Bailey__Gaming any new league is a good place to start
[0:17:05] <jeppeww> so yes
[0:17:09] <%Broand> PoE2 is a whole new campaign
[0:17:09] <+Woronov> na poe has 10 acts right now
[0:17:11] <1matheuw> seven i think
[0:17:13] <RoboticRexkek> phrasing
[0:17:14] <cartakus> Just a better game
[0:17:18] <Tomschiii> idk, the thought of an addon is kinda eh if you know that a part 2 is coming
[0:17:20] <+Birthright_Redux> This game would consume you Pat
[0:17:22] <@PrefectusCorgi> PrefectusCorgi subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 24 months! Man Greg is really messing up his stream setup seems normal
[0:17:23] <+transporterthesequel> Oh hey its a hashtag sponsored
[0:17:27] <%baka_sugoi> 2024 SPICY
[0:17:29] <+Birthright_Redux> it has like 1 million things to do
[0:17:29] <+Woronov> they wanted it to compete with Diablo 4
[0:17:31] <cartakus> F
[0:17:34] <%Bailey__Gaming> Loud Babys
[0:17:36] <jeppeww> PoE 2 is not really a sequel though
[0:17:40] <1matheuw> it was anounced at 2019 i think
[0:17:45] <%cvp5127> why does pat get the kids?
[0:17:48] <+RandyFistburgers> #throwdown
[0:17:51] <KenzBurp> it is #content
[0:17:53] <%Ixiah> path of exile mobile will come out sooner psaDogchamp
[0:17:53] <%Movemeister> It needs to be
[0:17:56] <%baka_sugoi> psaGiefstare woolieVS psaPorgmo
[0:17:58] <AntlerNoodle> It was announced before covid, like december 2019
[0:18:11] <%horsesaredumb> I need to know if Zangeif outweighs Pat
[0:18:14] <%fanciful_fright> I struggle to get into PoE, I feel like I need a sherpa to onboard me.
[0:18:15] <1matheuw> lmao said the cat
[0:18:17] <%Broand> Are you ready to see a bunch of spheregrids and atlas's
[0:18:19] <%Ixiah> make sure to update your path of building fork programm to use new builds
[0:18:20] <Tomschiii> arent they all
[0:18:23] <PirateMike_> since when you and Paige stream at the same time?
[0:18:23] <%baka_sugoi> Woke up from nap
[0:18:26] <+RandyFistburgers> They are a different kind of dumb
[0:18:29] <%Broand> The atlas is like a spheregrid of maps
[0:18:29] <ghostpopelive> Your not being very #sponsored right now
[0:18:32] <+Woronov> its one of the best service games
[0:18:36] <%ChrisPlaysThing> not even an hour
[0:18:36] <+bigslinglelino> I've played PoE for 300+ hours and I still have no fucking idea what I'm doing half the time lol
[0:18:41] <ergulor> Having class in 10 minutes, so i'll have to skip watching the reveal
[0:18:45] <+RobertWayneLewis98> I've never even seen this game played :)
[0:18:45] <+doe3879> Path of Exile might be the ultimate mind goblin
[0:18:46] <%holydeviant1> I just want to be a big guy with a big stick goddamnit
[0:18:53] <+igniz13> Just go Molten Strike Pat
[0:18:57] <+derrigible> i feel like the seconds countdown should be shifted to the right just a tad
[0:18:58] <ergulor> use a guide
[0:18:59] <%barrakuta371> I have both your streams up so I can hear you yelling at each other in real time
[0:18:59] <jeppeww> i've played 10k hours since the beta, and there's a bunch of stuff i don't know
[0:19:00] <cartakus> And speedrun most likely
[0:19:01] <%Nekros4442> thats about right
[0:19:03] <ergulor> you'll be happy
[0:19:03] <+doe3879> I have 3000 hours and I have no idea what 'm doing most of the time
[0:19:05] <+Woronov> 1,4k hours here still feel like a noob
[0:19:07] <ergulor> happier
[0:19:07] <%Ixiah> just get necro build, 0 gear, max damage, 0 deaths

[0:19:18] <+transporterthesequel> To be fair I just spend money in POE.
[0:19:19] <temzzii> Pat go eq jugg which is the biggest and strongest
[0:19:19] <%holydeviant1> PoE might be a good Goblin fight game
[0:19:23] <viciousgrim> 1300hr in and still bad at it LUL LUL NotLikeThis BibleThump
[0:19:24] <fatsausagedoggo> Played a while back. Saw the stream and said ah shit there we go again.
[0:19:28] <ergulor> 1500 hours here, just use a guide
[0:19:32] <%Nekros4442> @jeppeww also have around 8k hours. I still havent touched everything in the game
[0:19:39] <%holydeviant1> Just pump life kappa
[0:19:46] <Zourath> I have 6800 hours, I can make minion builds, but that's about it.
[0:19:57] <%holydeviant1> ... No seriously, babby build is just life
[0:19:58] <%Broand> I play like a week at the start of a league and then I burn out super quick
[0:19:59] <cartakus> Or if you're lazy just grab a build from the internet
[0:20:07] <+ShutUpAceyP> what is this event for?
[0:20:13] <%Ixiah> i spend money in POE for all the stashes and thats it, ggg makes most their money with fancy cosmetics
[0:20:13] <ergulor> that0s now being lazy
[0:20:14] <%OverzealousEuthanasiast> psaWink psaWink psaWink psaBlep
[0:20:19] <jeppeww> it's LITERALLY impossible to make a good build by yourself on the first try
[0:20:22] <ergulor> is knowing you suck at buulding guides
[0:20:22] <moondog_> moondog_ subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 27 months! YAASSS 27 MONTHS WITH ORB MAN AND WRESTLER DOG
[0:20:23] <Dova573> you do that for card games
[0:20:26] <+Woronov> @ShutUpAceyP ne path of erxile expansion release
[0:20:37] <%Broand> But you also want to do a cool build from the get go
[0:20:38] <%holydeviant1> PoE's unique design ethos is cool, honestly (ONLY make uniques to enable weirdass corner builds)
[0:20:42] <+zevitunez> Theres no shame in copying a build in the internet, go for it
[0:20:45] <+igniz13> Your first character is a discovery mission to find what you like. Then you just use a guide to actually do that right
[0:20:46] <%Broand> ye it's a balancing act
[0:20:48] <%Nekros4442> Pat, absolutely follow a build guide for Path of Exile until yoy even have an inkling of what is good or bad
[0:20:49] <+Woronov> @PatStaresAt look at it like kingmaker and build variety
[0:20:49] <%Joshbored> good poe builds are really hard to make
[0:20:54] <Etymorphic> First time through you can just BS your way through and enjoy the story. First time through only happens once
[0:20:54] <Man_in_the_Red> the search bar in the passive tree immesly helps with the builds for acts
[0:20:56] <cartakus> Nah
[0:20:57] <%Ixiah> you can engage while you follow the build and you see the changes in damage point by point
[0:21:00] <1matheuw> yeah i feel the same way about deckbuilding in LoR
[0:21:07] <AnnoyedApricot> you can make some WHACKY builds in PoE
[0:21:07] <%Dakuu75> Iâ€™ve played PoE onâ€™n off for like 10 years and i ALWAYS go Witch and summon a bunch of zombies and skeletons
[0:21:10] <%VictorVonLouche> They need to be less harsh on the perminance of the point allocation
[0:21:11] <ergulor> learn to make a build by starting and studying with popular builds
[0:21:14] <vicar_anat> Then you could try the Path of Building program where you can experiment with making as many builds as much as you want
[0:21:14] <+Birthright_Redux> PathOfBuilding is a godsend
[0:21:22] <temzzii> In this game everything is super respeccable, even though youre probably have to gonna look up on the wiki how
[0:21:27] <%OverzealousEuthanasiast> I use wikis for Dark Souls NPC quests
[0:21:28] <Man_in_the_Red> but for maps, yeah its gets tough
[0:21:29] <%Ascethetic> the best way i found is pick a skill and pick a route
[0:21:30] <%baka_sugoi> OLD GAME
[0:21:37] <%Broand> Some skills are easier to build than others, some skills are literally just bad
[0:21:40] <cartakus> Yeah def played baldur's gate....
[0:21:41] <topiodonk> i was 3!
[0:21:41] <%sandrews> I was six feel old
[0:21:41] <+RobertWayneLewis98> I was born that year!
[0:21:42] <RoboticRexkek> it's the perfect game to play a new build each season and stop playing because the build you did suck ass late game LUL
[0:21:43] <Parapattern> Experimenting is half the fun
[0:21:46] <%zacyzacyz> I always lookup builds I think the moulding of the character comes in the end game
[0:21:47] <+RobertWayneLewis98> hence the 98 in my name
[0:21:53] <Tomschiii> my mind is telling me that it feels cheap and that you are just one of many
[0:21:53] <%emperordread> So of them weren't even an URGE when Baldur's Gate came out
[0:21:58] <jeppeww> @PatStaresAt one option would be to have someone you could ask questions to i guess, but building something yourself blind and not ending up with trash is impossible
[0:21:59] <AnnoyedApricot> definitely the D2 spirit
[0:22:00] <ghostpopelive> I was 3
[0:22:16] <%Valison> @patstaresat I find stealing builds is a good way to learn how to make your own build later
[0:22:18] <+Laycas49> As a 31 year old who has never played a Diablo older than 3 I am excited to play the remaster on gamepass
[0:22:19] <+igniz13> My first character from 8+ years ago still sucks. Next league though, that'll be the one
[0:22:37] <%Joshbored> I think Sseth had the best method of just go till you hit a wall, then netdeck a new character to actually finish the game
[0:22:37] <%Broand> Respec is expensive though
[0:22:42] <draca23> Pat talking about builds in Baldurs Gate is hilarious to me because all I did in my playthrough of the series is just have my paladin walk in, tank hits, and spam AoEs attacks to kill everything.
[0:22:42] <1matheuw> you can respec in poe i think
[0:22:48] <%zacyzacyz> it's hard at first though it costs a lot of orbs
[0:22:48] <Etymorphic> You need items to respec fyi orbs of regret
[0:22:48] <RoboticRexkek> I would argue you are better off starting a new char
[0:22:51] <xXVeggiePLusXx> Yeah that's BONKERS
[0:22:52] <chowndawg> it does cost to respec
[0:22:55] <%dasmause> @PatStaresAt the thing about POE skill tree is that theres much less tree nodes that actually give major stats or change your playstyle a lot, vast majority are +5 attack and stuff
[0:22:59] <+igniz13> You get a respec at league start, every 3 months
[0:23:00] <+Woronov> if its there u can get to it
[0:23:04] <+igniz13> or so
[0:23:06] <jeppeww> respec is only the passive tree, doesn't help with gear, gems, ascendancy options
[0:23:07] <+bigslinglelino> past a certain level its more optimal to just make a new character than to respec
[0:23:10] <%fanciful_fright> My issue with PoE is "The hell am I doing with gems and what do I to have the right skills"
[0:23:11] <%Ixiah> pat you can respec, 80 points cost you 50 chaos, thats not much
[0:23:14] <chowndawg> not super, but for a new player it is
[0:23:15] <%Birthright_Redux> Birthright_Redux subscribed with Prime. 
[0:23:15] <+trackles_64> No respec i n DS1
[0:23:21] <Zero_Jacks> The option exists, thats all you need
[0:23:27] <Man_in_the_Red> Orbs of Regret are both too rare and too common
[0:23:35] <temzzii> It gets cheaper the longer the league goes on
[0:23:36] <%OverzealousEuthanasiast> I remember failing to use the talk to animals skill on first in D2 so had to restart to get those extra juicy side quests' experience
[0:23:47] <+trackles_64> all the money please
[0:23:50] <%Birthright_Redux> @PatStaresAt They've made some major changes to the skill tree lately, its quite nice
[0:23:51] <urkleturtle> you get like 20 respec points just doing quests and a lot of build guides do respec from leveling builds to endgame ones
[0:23:52] <%Ixiah> monie psaBougie
[0:23:52] <%zacyzacyz> how do you feel about the whole stash system?
[0:24:02] <cartakus> Yes mony please
[0:24:02] <Etymorphic> @Man_in_the_Red not enough when you need too many when you don't
[0:24:05] <Necnill> LUL
[0:24:05] <%zacyzacyz> LUL
[0:24:12] <+Woronov> this mfers taking my MTX money -.-

[0:24:18] <chowndawg> money money money
[0:24:18] <+takotoots> LUL
[0:24:20] <+igniz13> Pat and Paige going to run links and get each other killed
[0:24:21] <topiodonk> the fact the every character uses the same tree just starting at different places makes it less scary
[0:24:24] <cartakus> Amazing
[0:24:25] <%MugenSandan> WAIT YOU LIVE IN THE SAME HOUSE
[0:24:29] <viciousgrim> yes
[0:24:31] <Necnill> Get your coin, son
[0:24:31] <1matheuw> yea it would be cool
[0:24:33] <%Birthright_Redux> The game is free but you basically have to buy in to a bunch of tabs to not live like an animal
[0:24:41] <%zacyzacyz> yeah co op is great for leveling
[0:24:45] <Goergorion> Scam Artist Pat
[0:24:49] <%MugenSandan> psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin
[0:24:52] <+igniz13> Link skills mean if you die the linked person dies. Perfect for you two

[0:24:53] <%KineticZen> In This House, We Believe in Costreaming
[0:24:54] <+Woronov> as expected
[0:24:55] <%OverzealousEuthanasiast> official "influencer living dorm"
[0:25:01] <%barrakuta371> I love both of you yelling at each other on  each stream in real time
[0:25:02] <+trackles_64> Elden Ring tho
[0:25:07] <chowndawg> that makes sense
[0:25:12] <Etymorphic> That effectiveness of added damage tho
[0:25:12] <CapCasual> Nope.
[0:25:13] <%Daxalog> Why is Peach streaming this?
[0:25:13] <1matheuw> fking doubt that
[0:25:14] <+Woronov> they expanded it last legue XD
[0:25:14] <Gorgs7> HA
[0:25:15] <%Nekros4442> no
[0:25:17] <RoboticRexkek> they will make it even bigger
[0:25:21] <urkleturtle> this is gonna be tough for paige. poe is like mind poison for people with adhd. the game is all about slowly working towards long-term goals
[0:25:23] <AntlerNoodle> They added MORE stuff to the skill tree
[0:25:25] <%Ixiah> they added gems to make the tree bigger psaSmug
[0:25:27] <%Broand> Skill tree  was reshuffled last league
[0:25:29] <%dasmause> @PatStaresAt also skill tree literally has a search bar in game
[0:25:39] <%Broand> You can get items which make the skill tree bigger
[0:25:42] <Zourath> Nope, more scary. Now we have Cluster Jewels, who knows what else we'll get.
[0:25:42] <+igniz13> @Daxalog money
[0:25:45] <@PrefectusCorgi> Make it more smaller icon
[0:25:47] <chowndawg> it is specifically meant to be scary complex
[0:25:52] <temzzii> I want the skill tree to be even scarier
[0:25:52] <%Valison> @patstaresat they did a big skill tree revision about 3 months ago
[0:25:54] <%Broand> And most of those items are TRAPS
[0:25:58] <Man_in_the_Red> they did when Masteries were added
[0:26:01] <+trackles_64> causw ere twtich chat
[0:26:02] <%skrewarrior> skrewarrior subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! bumbo
[0:26:03] <ghostpopelive> @patstaresat there is a search bar so if you were doing a necromacer style build you could search skeleton and see all the nodes related
[0:26:03] <%MugenSandan> I approached the skill tree like learning league: look up the best build first and just do that
[0:26:04] <+igniz13> Ream starting soon
[0:26:04] <Gorgs7> Nope, add biohazard sharp edges to that shit
[0:26:05] <AntlerNoodle> Make all the nodes into smiley faces c:
[0:26:06] <1matheuw> because minimalism or some shit
[0:26:15] <%holydeviant1> Is that the one where the nodes matter more?
[0:26:15] <Man_in_the_Red> so you see icons for all the minor passive for lifesteal for instance
[0:26:22] <%Ixiah> respec only cost 50 chaos, its not that much later in the game, realy
[0:26:24] <jeppeww> just make the crab, a classic tree
[0:26:25] <Zourath> Crab build best build
[0:26:28] <+trackles_64> is thisa mobile game?
[0:26:39] <chowndawg> they did a little bit of that last patch lol
[0:26:40] <+igniz13> No it's not
[0:26:42] <+Woronov> nah but console :D
[0:26:43] <%Ixiah> path of exile mobil is announed
[0:26:44] <AnnoyedApricot> they were trying to make a mobile one
[0:26:45] <anime_dude> not yet*
[0:26:45] <%MugenSandan> no it's PC/Console
[0:26:49] <kublego24> not yet i believe they are planning something for mobile
[0:26:49] <%baka_sugoi> DON'T YOU GUYS HAVE PHONES?
[0:26:51] <+Grayhammatter> PC and console
[0:26:52] <%dasmause> @PatStaresAt ALSO a lot of nodes are grouped up, like there is a large meta-node that has all the nodes giving you HP buffs for example, and its visible from further away
[0:26:53] <%TheHateFish> Even simpler: Add an option to make it show you your options and nothing else. So if you can pick +5% attack speed or +3% movement speed and nothing else, it'll show a list with just those two.
[0:26:53] <%Broand> Nope but there was talk of a mobile version
[0:26:54] <chowndawg> eventually
[0:26:54] <+bigslinglelino> Iirc they are developing a mobile version
[0:26:55] <Zourath> Nope, they announced a mobile game version, but no news on it yet.
[0:26:56] <vicar_anat> Its Battle Royale only
[0:26:59] <%Ixiah> there will be
[0:27:01] <ergulor> iirc it was an april fools joke
[0:27:03] <%zacyzacyz> i wish I could fill the tree so I don't have to think everytime you level up LUL
[0:27:07] <abowlofbeets> I played a bit. But then it started to kill my Potato PC. I did managed to make a sorta fun build on my own, but it didn't do well in late game.
[0:27:15] <chowndawg> they plan on a mobile version
[0:27:16] <+Woronov> they revealed it with poe 2 and it was hilarious XD
[0:27:17] <moonmintparadise> oh no there is a 5 second delay between you and paige for me
[0:27:17] <+trackles_64> Do you not have phones?
[0:27:17] <RoboticRexkek> will the mobile app be crossplay with PC?
[0:27:18] <jeppeww> this game doesn't even run good on PC lol, GLHF with mobile
[0:27:22] <@PrefectusCorgi> You and Paige are opposite corners
[0:27:25] <+igniz13> @TheHateFish A huge part of the tree is planning where you'll end up, so that doesn't work
[0:27:26] <%TheHateFish> One more thing: Don't you guys have phones?
[0:27:28] <+Grayhammatter> don't you guys have phones?
[0:27:29] <Leolenardo> I'd kill for a moble version
[0:27:36] <%NitronStreams> "you guys have phones dont you?
[0:27:39] <Etymorphic> There is a battle royale mode every now and then that they open up
[0:27:40] <chowndawg> yes
[0:27:46] <+igniz13> steamdeck is the mobile version

[0:27:47] <Tomschiii> noone would want a mobile version anyway
[0:27:49] <+RobertWayneLewis98> what's happening here? is this a dlc for the game or something?
[0:27:50] <zerointelligence000> abuse!
[0:27:51] <+bigslinglelino> I'd kill for controller support on pc
[0:27:53] <RoboticRexkek> fuck-a-you
[0:27:54] <@PrefectusCorgi> She is muted and cant fix
[0:27:56] <%TheHateFish> @TheHateFish Yeah, I know, but it'd be useful for newbies doing their first run.
[0:27:56] <Kyoshikei> Oh no Paige is muted
[0:27:56] <+Fefe41> paaaatuh
[0:27:58] <+crazyspartan214> Paige is muted

[0:30:08] <ergulor> not the leagues
[0:30:09] <%Broand> They disappear, or they augment onto the top of everything else
[0:30:09] <Zourath> They exist, but they're shunted to side content.

[0:31:57] <chowndawg> its great for us
[0:31:58] <abowlofbeets> I wish DE would do that.
[0:31:59] <%Birthright_Redux> patch notes are always great for this game
[0:32:00] <Zourath> Ooh, they're doing the patchnote thing again
[0:32:02] <%holydeviant1> @Sotetsu Instead of Gold, you get items that you can use to craft and change other items
[0:32:03] <+zevitunez> oh man, time to no life on 4 fab
[0:32:05] <%Broand> The "league" is the gimmick they run for 3 months for reference
[0:32:05] <tanarath> @man_in_the_red I stopped played right before they tanked the optimization, that sucks. Did they ever fix the optimization btw?
[0:32:06] <cartakus> How nice
[0:32:07] <anime_dude> im going to be reading those patch notes till i go to bed tonight
[0:32:07] <AntlerNoodle> Who?

[0:32:23] <%Broand> No more zana huh
[0:32:24] <Man_in_the_Red> @tanarath its a bit better
[0:32:33] <+igniz13> we beat the old end bosses
[0:32:45] <%DamnFineCupofStreaming> DamnFineCupofStreaming subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 26 months! hype
[0:32:46] <tanarath> That's better than nothing. Still sucks, though.
[0:32:51] <@TheYellowcouch> wtf this looks sick
[0:32:52] <worldbrand> DE does do that, they're not always as accurate or perfect as ggg's tho
[0:32:53] <%Sotetsu> @holydeviant1 Huh, sounds complicated!
[0:32:55] <+igniz13> we didn't expect more endbosses
[0:33:04] <@PrefectusCorgi> oh yeah
[0:33:05] <FrostedZaibatsu> Looks fine
[0:33:09] <%alphonseisbest> VoteYea VoteYea PogChamp VoteYea

[0:34:55] <anime_dude> please tell me i dont have to kill sirus unless i want to anymore
[0:34:57] <%dasmause> the chat has spent your pre-stream trying to tell you the skill tree isnt so bad only for devs to just show you a SECOND skill tree
[0:34:59] <+KBGuilty> Vegeta and Nappa lol
[0:35:01] <+igniz13> whoops cthulu
[0:35:03] <+bigslinglelino> honestly after all my playtime I still don't know anything about the story
[0:35:06] <MattHellmann3D> I'm waiting for the RPG that gives us a "Skill Dartboard"

[0:35:22] <cartakus> I see.....
[0:35:37] <anime_dude> man if this is good i may have to drop that 400 for those cool portals
[0:35:41] <Man_in_the_Red> @zerointelligence000 league mechanics are isolated encounters with rewards that appear mid campaign and afterward, these expansions are all postgame
[0:35:47] <%zacyzacyz> neat
[0:35:52] <Not_Paladin> wow look at those 40k chaos gods
[0:36:22] <cartakus> Infinite hunger huh
[0:36:27] <%zacyzacyz> prefixes too LUL
[0:36:33] <jeppeww> Absence of Symmetry and Harmony is a SICK zone name

[0:36:55] <+Grayhammatter> ah yes, eldritch horrors
[0:36:57] <1matheuw> my computer is catching fire already
[0:36:57] <+zevitunez> pat, remember when you atarted league u used a lot of 3rd party apps? this also happens on POE
[0:36:58] <%solracc25> So much text
[0:36:58] <zerointelligence000> @Man_in_the_Red ok I kinda get it... come from ffxiv so I just assumed the expansions work the same way but that sounds cool
[0:37:00] <%horsesaredumb> is that a stand?
[0:37:16] <%UvBenServed> SPEEN
[0:37:18] <+igniz13> game has stands
[0:37:22] <@TheYellowcouch> Is this what we sound like when we talk about 14
[0:37:24] <kublego24> you can roll these bosses? what?
[0:37:27] <cartakus> The bullshit bullet hell the builds become is so funny
[0:37:41] <%horsesaredumb> @TheYellowcouch yes
[0:37:41] <%alphonseisbest> IS THAT  A GUN MAGE?!!!
[0:37:41] <%Daxalog> Hades players be like:
[0:37:44] <cartakus> Yeah 14 nerds
[0:37:44] <%BlackMage66652> @TheYellowcouch Yes
[0:37:51] <%AnthroMetal> I should really play more Path of Exile
[0:37:58] <hardin360> Do you have twitch drops enabled Pat?
[0:38:16] <1matheuw> looks similar
[0:38:18] <%Sotetsu> Eye-core
[0:38:20] <+bigslinglelino> oh god more currencies
[0:38:24] <chowndawg> it's pretty great if you are into it
[0:38:26] <anime_dude> man going to be great running into that after you kill the map boss....
[0:38:26] <zerointelligence000> tomestones!?
[0:38:31] <%Ixiah> no more Scourge ? :(
[0:38:37] <+Grayhammatter> good GOD
[0:38:37] <+Volkrotia> Path of Exile is a lot like WF progression wise. WIth an equally confusing progression system to boot
[0:38:46] <%zacyzacyz> yoooo no more watch stones let's go
[0:38:46] <runewalker01> das a LOT
[0:38:46] <%Ixiah> get ready for endgame content

[0:38:49] <jeppeww> that's the atlas, the endgame progression
[0:38:50] <%MrBorisMakarov> atpRtsd
[0:38:50] <%Broand> That's the atlas
[0:38:51] <+igniz13> that's the atlas
[0:38:52] <jbrachob> Pat broke
[0:38:53] <tanarath> @kublego24 So, items that move you to a boss instance have prefixes & suffixes too. This translates to: more loot but also more enemy buffs. So scaling endgame content.
[0:38:54] <kublego24> that's the atlas
[0:38:54] <AnnoyedApricot> shows all the maps
[0:38:55] <@TheYellowcouch> I thought that was a map
[0:38:55] <churropoppa> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[0:38:56] <%zacyzacyz> that's the atlas
[0:39:00] <@TheYellowcouch> wait is it a map?
[0:39:02] <blaflegume> it's a tree of maps
[0:39:03] <%skrewarrior> that's crazy i kinda want to play poe now
[0:39:04] <+igniz13> make maps hared by adding watchstones
[0:39:05] <+bigslinglelino> each of those nodes is a tileset for a map lol
[0:39:05] <+Grayhammatter> that's the atlas
[0:39:07] <%UvBenServed> Skill Yggdrasil
[0:39:10] <chowndawg> think of it as the multiverse

[0:39:22] <KahnWick> Oh no, ANOTHER TREE!?
[0:39:26] <1matheuw> there it is

[0:39:39] <jeppeww> Path of TREEEEEEEEEEEEEEES
[0:39:43] <%Daxalog> 117 passives to choose from
[0:39:43] <%zacyzacyz> no more zones that's awesome
[0:39:44] <cartakus> GOOD OLD POE
[0:39:45] <1matheuw> whole ass world tree
[0:39:45] <ghostpopelive> Brain goblins are dead. Brain giants.
[0:39:46] <%MrBorisMakarov> YOOOOO
[0:39:46] <%Ixiah> they added one tree just for pat ^^
[0:39:50] <+Grayhammatter> goddamn atlas tree
[0:39:50] <Man_in_the_Red> Dyson Sphere Grid
[0:39:54] <%angryoptimist> but what about the turbo encabulator and the magnetoreluctance.
[0:39:57] <urkleturtle> this is so much better
[0:39:59] <+PwnyB> THAT was a skill biome.
[0:40:01] <+zevitunez> yooo this is big
[0:40:03] <1matheuw> brain monstrosities
[0:40:08] <anime_dude> i mean i like it more than the old maven way of doing it
[0:40:10] <Gorgs7> literally CANNOT see the whole thing, can't zoom out enough
[0:40:10] <+igniz13> This is mostly reward boosts
[0:40:18] <+bigslinglelino> brain hurts
[0:40:20] <%Daxalog> Avoid the GAZE
[0:40:23] <+igniz13> Get more rewards of the type you want
[0:40:32] <%Broand> none of these things means anything to pat
[0:40:32] <%BlackMage66652> Pat looks like a school bus predator right now
[0:40:36] <$ItsRatman> I understand these words funny man.
[0:40:38] <anime_dude> wait i hope they let us use normal regrets to undo it
[0:40:38] <+Local16> Good to see that Pat knows whats going on
[0:40:38] <+PwnyB> Mind Goblins have evolved into Brain Aberrations.
[0:40:39] <%fanciful_fright> So, its a skill tree that changes your rewards?
[0:40:41] <Man_in_the_Red> so, all of the stuff mentioned were previous league mechanics
[0:40:41] <+igniz13> It's the side content
[0:40:43] <+Woronov> its cool
[0:40:43] <cartakus> Gaslight devotion
[0:40:44] <chowndawg> make more money
[0:40:44] <%Amadeusguy> wow it's literally just a tree full of reward boosts
[0:40:44] <urkleturtle> i am very happy yes
[0:40:45] <%Broand> This is better than before
[0:40:47] <%DamnFineCupofStreaming> this tree is eldritch
[0:40:48] <anAngryHamster> NUMBERS
[0:40:56] <librettodude> Speccing into content
[0:40:59] <%korean_random> JOOCE
[0:41:02] <zerointelligence000> MAPS
[0:41:06] <chowndawg> maps are zones that you run btw
[0:41:28] <1matheuw> sidegrades nice
[0:41:34] <tanarath> Nice!
[0:41:52] <Gorgs7> because you fucking need to plan goddammit
[0:42:01] <%korean_random> yeah, that sucked butt
[0:42:24] <blaflegume> finally!
[0:42:25] <%zacyzacyz> "post endgame" LUL
[0:42:26] <Man_in_the_Red> Whew
[0:42:29] <+igniz13> That's nice
[0:42:30] <%Birthright_Redux> Influence system gone then?
[0:42:32] <tanarath> Destiny could learn from this!
[0:42:39] <cartakus> Squid1 Squid3 Squid4
[0:42:46] <1matheuw> yeah slot machine makes the brain chemicals happy
[0:42:47] <%Ixiah> well have all the crafting in the world then, poe crafting is big
[0:42:48] <jeppeww> LISTED RADIUS
[0:42:50] <anime_dude> woot for power creep
[0:42:50] <jeppeww> BEST CHANGE
[0:42:50] <Etymorphic> radius number!
[0:42:56] <abowlofbeets> New season, New Tabula Rasa farm.
[0:42:59] <zerointelligence000> I zoned out for 2 seconds and now I'm totally lost XD
[0:43:02] <%zacyzacyz> crazy
[0:43:15] <worldbrand> Depends on whether the crafting requires several other slot machines imo
[0:43:22] <+Woronov> coool
[0:43:23] <%zacyzacyz> oh fr
[0:43:28] <%angryoptimist> Cthulhu loves money
[0:43:33] <%zacyzacyz> this sounds so awesome
[0:43:43] <Tomschiii> man, so many menus, texts and trees kinda worsens the experience, but thats just me
[0:43:45] <Man_in_the_Red> niiice, debuff mods
[0:44:11] <%Sotetsu> The longer this trailer goes on, the less I want to start playing. I'm guessing this isn't designed for new players.
[0:44:20] <%zacyzacyz> I hope they stack nicely with curses
[0:44:20] <%alphonseisbest> This is a UNI lecture LUL
[0:44:21] <tanarath> The fact that they explain all of this is nice.
[0:44:25] <%Ixiah> maven is bossrush mode
[0:44:26] <%angryoptimist> Having so much stuff to focus on is nice if you're the sorta person who likes that.  Some people want to figurative drown in systems.
[0:44:27] <%KineticZen> This is less an expansion patch announcement stream, and more of a game loot design primer
[0:44:29] <%baka_sugoi> psaOrb
[0:44:34] <Man_in_the_Red> @sotetsu the endgame isnt, the campaign is good fun, however
[0:44:36] <%Nobrev> pat is an orb of conflict
[0:44:41] <1matheuw> cool
[0:44:42] <%alphonseisbest> @Sotetsu nope, this is the endgame stuffs
[0:44:58] <%Sotetsu> @Man_in_the_Red That's good. I've never liked endgame stuff.
[0:45:07] <librettodude> maybe the real path of exile was the mechanics delirium we suffered along the way
[0:45:16] <+Ondartyr> Man, I tried to get into PoE several times and bounced off hard every time. I personally much prefer Last Epoch, but that's still in EA and has MUCH less content.
[0:45:28] <+Ondartyr> This looks really cool, though.
[0:45:38] <1matheuw> ayo is that a brain floating?
[0:45:46] <@TheYellowcouch> Love dominating the exarch
[0:45:51] <worldbrand> path of exile is a game i would love to play if i had infinite time
[0:45:54] <%KineticZen> PoE is what people in accounting do for fun when their job fails to sate their burning lust for math
[0:45:59] <AntlerNoodle> Ponder the orb
[0:45:59] <jeppeww> path of ORB
[0:46:01] <%vivaldiva> psaOrb
[0:46:03] <Zeif00> shouldn't this be in PoE and not special events?
[0:46:04] <+Woronov> jesus
[0:46:09] <%angryoptimist> This is, like, a dissertation on loot genetics.
[0:46:12] <%Broand> Yeep
[0:46:12] <%zacyzacyz> LUL
[0:46:13] <%Nobrev> psaOrb psaOrb psaOrb
[0:46:15] <kublego24> how many exalt variants are there at this point, eight?
[0:46:17] <%Ixiah> poe is the EVE online of diablo games
[0:46:19] <chowndawg> don't worry this is for experts
[0:46:19] <%spitelite> this sounds like something they would put in a bad sitcom to make fun of the nerdy kid for playing video games
[0:46:19] <jeppeww> this happens every patch pretty much lol
[0:46:21] <%Sotetsu> @Ondartyr It's also $35 compared to free. :(
[0:46:21] <@TheYellowcouch> At least it's in english and not translated from japanese
[0:46:21] <%skrewarrior> words are in fact being said
[0:46:22] <%korean_random> the current influence system is really obtuse too
[0:46:25] <anime_dude> if they cost more than 2ex they are worthless
[0:46:33] <KahnWick> Currency: The Game
[0:46:36] <%Broand> Wait until the league mechanics show up
[0:46:37] <runewalker01> I comprehend nothing
[0:46:37] <Man_in_the_Red> @kublego24 the old ones MIGHT be gone because of the influence changes
[0:46:49] <+Grayhammatter> wow
[0:46:50] <+Woronov> WTF
[0:46:50] <chowndawg> wow
[0:46:54] <%MrBorisMakarov> Holy fuck

[0:47:23] <temzzii> Thats nuts
[0:47:38] <%kyh9> Grey health
[0:47:59] <+Ondartyr> @Sotetsu I much prefer spending money up front rather than trying to figure out which of those bloody stashes I should buy (for what's probably going to end up being a similar price)
[0:48:03] <Man_in_the_Red> Song of Fire n Ice build i made back in betrayel, finall
[0:48:04] <+igniz13> They're endgame
[0:48:04] <Tomschiii> this is like math class where you pretend to understand what the teacher is saying
[0:48:19] <%TheHateFish> They're the endest of endgame
[0:48:27] <urkleturtle> they always show the most nuts uniques on these reveals

[0:50:06] <@PrefectusCorgi> numbers
[0:50:06] <%BlackMage66652> Sex Kappa
[0:50:14] <+sirjonston> I hope pat goes upstairs to explain this to paige in explicit details
[0:50:21] <abowlofbeets> Wow, a game with proper endgame? Take notes Blizzard
[0:50:22] <%CalderGaming> @Guardiansaiyan independently sponsored
[0:50:24] <%chance_h> This is like watching a technical analyst review of a fictional field of science
[0:50:26] <Weberkraut> @Guardiansaiyan both sponsored separately probably
[0:50:27] <+trackles_64> OP
[0:50:27] <+igniz13> Sex tents have been in PoE for ages
[0:50:33] <%Sotetsu> Sex tents?

[0:51:08] <%TheHateFish> I mean, at least they know
[0:51:10] <%BlackMage66652> This is like listening to someone read stereo instructions
[0:51:12] <urkleturtle> i remember when sextant blocking was a thing you had to do. that was awful
[0:51:13] <Man_in_the_Red> mids for the entire endgame
[0:51:33] <+Grayhammatter> sex tents
[0:51:53] <%zacyzacyz> yo?
[0:51:53] <worldbrand> strategic sex tents
[0:52:02] <%zacyzacyz> that's neat
[0:52:03] <mickrickler> facefuck of info
[0:52:09] <+Grayhammatter> zana FeelsBadMan
[0:52:12] <chowndawg> boat league
[0:52:14] <urkleturtle> i'm gonna miss zana
[0:52:20] <%zacyzacyz> just buy the mod you want from someone
[0:52:26] <%BlackMage66652> I'm a smoothbrain with fucking calculus, is PoE still fun?
[0:52:41] <chowndawg> yes
[0:52:43] <librettodude> it's wacky
[0:52:47] <+igniz13> Yeah
[0:52:49] <chowndawg> just don't worry about endgame
[0:52:52] <+igniz13> This is all endgame stuff
[0:52:53] <anime_dude> nice
[0:52:58] <Man_in_the_Red> yesnt, depends on if your making 10 characters a league or not
[0:53:06] <Necnill> is it tho
[0:53:14] <chowndawg> PoE is good for that
[0:53:14] <tanarath> Man, Destiny is so great.
[0:53:15] <CouldBeAKitten> I need my friend to make my builds, cause I'm kinda dumb, but yeah it's still fun.
[0:53:17] <@TheYellowcouch> the shade of it all
[0:53:21] <%zacyzacyz> LUL
[0:53:22] <1matheuw> imagine playing destiny
[0:53:26] <1matheuw> couldnt be me
[0:53:28] <+bigslinglelino> we removed half the game now give money
[0:53:28] <cybz99> Anything is better than Destiny lmao
[0:53:34] <blaflegume> yeah, they have always been good about informing us
[0:53:41] <Weberkraut> I wish I wasn't so burnt out on this game
[0:53:41] <JdotSweapA> dont forget to fill out our survey again
[0:53:44] <+Woronov> he is still going XD
[0:53:47] <kublego24> breachstone mission???
[0:53:48] <LoneFonte> "teehee, we can't tell you all the secrets..."
[0:53:52] <%zacyzacyz> neat
[0:53:57] <+coinduck11> I'm still so salty about it
[0:54:06] <+igniz13> reroll maps to get the stuff you want
[0:54:13] <%korean_random> oh, non-completed maps is sick
[0:54:15] <%TheHateFish> Pat looks so fucking done
[0:54:19] <%Birthright_Redux> @PatStaresAt These changes are actually insane
[0:54:20] <+trackles_64> Sounds complicated
[0:54:22] <%korean_random> you can go through the atlas faster
[0:54:37] <%Broand> But how about krangling?
[0:54:44] <+igniz13> This is 30 minutes of endgame nonsense if you don't know endgame
[0:54:45] <%zacyzacyz> good ol' kurig
[0:54:48] <librettodude> I can see the gears grinding
[0:54:49] <chowndawg> yes
[0:54:49] <+Grayhammatter> krangling is out
[0:54:53] <Man_in_the_Red> oh so theyre now like the Elder and Shaper guardians
[0:54:58] <%korean_random> thank god
[0:54:59] <$bnuuy0> PoE still have performance issues? Last I played everyone was mad about poor optimization or whatever
[0:55:05] <Pookiedaexzile> Why is Peach Streaming this
[0:55:08] <%korean_random> current atlas is so annoying to go through
[0:55:12] <chowndawg> sick
[0:55:16] <+Woronov> HOLY SHIT XD
[0:55:17] <Weberkraut> the conqueror atlas sucked I'm glad its gone
[0:55:18] <librettodude> oh PoE is still unstable as shit
[0:55:20] <LoneFonte> @Pookiedaexzile also sponsored
[0:55:20] <+Grayhammatter> SICK
[0:55:21] <Weberkraut> Shaper/Elder was so much better
[0:55:23] <kublego24> oh nice
[0:55:24] <%Ixiah> i never had problems with vulcan
[0:55:24] <%zacyzacyz> oh my
[0:55:31] <%Broand> Old content is still in the game, it's just harder to get them
[0:55:34] <urkleturtle> oh nice
[0:55:42] <%korean_random> nice, there is now a point in doing maven
[0:55:43] <tanarath> @pookiedaexzile Sponsor & cooping with Pat.
[0:55:46] <+igniz13> This is the more regular stuff
[0:56:03] <+Grayhammatter> oh cool
[0:56:11] <chowndawg> nice they learning
[0:56:18] <Weberkraut> oh its just Metamorph again
[0:56:23] <blaflegume> you mean I don't have to buy a new kind of tab?
[0:56:27] <%korean_random> you have to click it? quinStop
[0:56:54] <+igniz13> What is this glacial cascade build?
[0:57:13] <%Ixiah> ritual 2.0
[0:57:15] <Man_in_the_Red> time to fish out the boss killer builds
[0:57:22] <+zevitunez> numbahs
[0:57:37] <%korean_random> more like metamorph 2.0 I guess
[0:57:38] <+crazyspartan214> Will I have enough time to reach  current content if I were to start fresh?
[0:57:41] <%zacyzacyz> ritual + metamorphosis
[0:57:41] <abowlofbeets> @Man_in_the_Red Just wait a 2 weeks to be safe.
[0:57:42] <+Grayhammatter> oh god, more recipes
[0:57:46] <$realm_forge> Mmmmmmm numbers....
[0:57:54] <Pookiedaexzile> paiges face taking in this info is priceless
[0:57:57] <heychaney> poe doesnt have dopamine huh good lord
[0:58:01] <1matheuw> brain hurty
[0:58:08] <+igniz13> This is all new content
[0:58:25] <anime_dude> yo two new stash tabs now i have to spend money
[0:58:27] <Goergorion> they did, then they removed it
[0:58:29] <zerointelligence000> being able to influence your rewards sounds rad
[0:58:30] <Man_in_the_Red> Stonks
[0:58:36] <%korean_random> @crazyspartan214 I would suggest waiting for the new league
[0:58:38] <Weberkraut> PoE makes you cross between content a lot
[0:58:39] <$realm_forge> I feel like Iâ€™m listening to jordi laforge explain how a warp core works
[0:58:43] <Weberkraut> You can't just sustain one thing usually
[0:58:45] <derekpwns> tabard rep farming
[0:58:47] <%fanciful_fright> Oh well, I'm just gonna watch Zizaran's PoE university series to figure out what the hell is going on.
[0:58:53] <Weberkraut> unless you wanna trade a lot for the items to access that content
[0:58:58] <chowndawg> simple to use difficult to maximize
[0:59:04] <%Dakuu75> Omg the order matter?
[0:59:06] <+Grayhammatter> simple LUL
[0:59:11] <$ItsRatman> "relatively simple"
[0:59:11] <%Broand> This is a simple one
[0:59:14] <+ontoue> @crazyspartan214 everyone starts fresh when new content comes out in PoE, you have to start new characters for it
[0:59:19] <%AnthroMetal> @fanciful_fright As someone who has never really clicked with PoE, is that a good starting point?
[0:59:26] <+igniz13> You just boost monster to get the loot you want
[0:59:29] <%korean_random> simple by PoE standards LUL
[0:59:34] <Weberkraut> minions are always op anyway
[0:59:34] <%Ixiah> Bow league ?
[0:59:36] <+Woronov> minions are alwys OP
[0:59:38] <%dasmause> @PatStaresAt minions are already good
[0:59:40] <%zacyzacyz> it's complicated but once you get how currency systems work then every thing makes sense
[0:59:41] <+Kinoskae> While I appreciate the dump of info, this has "Fitness Gram Pacer Test" vibes, lol
[0:59:43] <urkleturtle> minions have always been high tier
[0:59:45] <Pookiedaexzile> Balance "Manifesto"
[0:59:46] <chowndawg> minions are already good
[0:59:47] <+Grayhammatter> bow and self cast league
[0:59:50] <Pookiedaexzile> That's fucked
[0:59:53] <tanarath> Balance Manifesto
[1:00:00] <+Fatmanjoggin> at one point they nerfed skeleton damage by 40% and it was still the best build
[1:00:04] <+igniz13> miinions are one of the easiest to start with
[1:00:07] <%fanciful_fright> @AnthroMetal No idea, but I know that Zizaran is recommended by the people I know that are deep into PoE.
[1:00:10] <urkleturtle> you can shit up the screen with so many minions in this
[1:00:15] <+bigslinglelino> minion builds are always hilariously broken its great
[1:00:15] <blaflegume> my zombois fuck everything up
[1:00:16] <+Kinoskae> I love minions ever since Necro in D2
[1:00:16] <Man_in_the_Red> moneymoneymoney
[1:00:16] <+igniz13> Thank fuck for gem stash tabs
[1:00:24] <Zourath> Minions are in the worst state they've ever been. They're merely great now.
[1:00:25] <%Ixiah> always buy stashes when they are on sale, they are on sale each 4 weeks
[1:00:27] <temzzii> Theres a skill that lets you summon like 40 skeletons
[1:00:28] <Man_in_the_Red> .... lemme get that gem stash tho...
[1:00:30] <%korean_random> you have to pay for those
[1:00:32] <temzzii> Dont tell paige
[1:00:33] <%Dakuu75> I love summoning a hoard of skeletons and zombies
[1:00:33] <%AnthroMetal> @fanciful_fright welp, might as well dive into the deep end lol.
[1:00:44] <+igniz13> Now I can store all my horded gems and flasks
[1:00:45] <%zacyzacyz> 500?!
[1:00:51] <+Local16> Skeleton bomb build is always something fun
[1:00:58] <%Ixiah> for jokes
[1:00:59] <AnnoyedApricot> because they know
[1:01:00] <Enn19> You can name them
[1:01:01] <chowndawg> because regret
[1:01:02] <%Broand> You can rename tabs
[1:01:04] <%zacyzacyz> LUL
[1:01:04] <tanarath> LUL
[1:01:08] <%JoshManVGH> Buyback? or SellBack?
[1:01:10] <urkleturtle> welp, more must buy tabs
[1:01:11] <%JoshManVGH> Oh
[1:01:16] <Enn19> Only the ones you bought though
[1:01:21] <CouldBeAKitten> Sometimes you regret purchasing something stupid like punch gloves
[1:01:23] <+Fefe41> Destiny must be in that tab
[1:01:31] <$realm_forge> Those are for nfts
[1:01:36] <%VictorVonLouche> They're having fun with mostly dull information
[1:01:43] <%Dakuu75> Wow i dont have to spend a million hours in my attache case now
[1:01:43] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[1:01:44] <%fanciful_fright> @AnthroMetal Think of it more as Ziz being a swimming instructor trying to get you ready for when you are dropped into the ocean
[1:01:54] <abowlofbeets> Ember Keep? HELLO.
[1:01:55] <Enn19> Yep
[1:01:55] <+Grayhammatter> yep
[1:01:56] <Weberkraut> yes

[1:01:57] <urkleturtle> yep
[1:01:57] <%korean_random> yep
[1:01:58] <%zacyzacyz> I don't know about these ones tbh
[1:01:59] <Weberkraut> quite expensive usually
[1:01:59] <%Broand> yes
[1:02:00] <%Ixiah> just cosmetics
[1:02:01] <+igniz13> Fancy paid skins and mtx
[1:02:01] <tanarath> They are!
[1:02:03] <TigerClaws12> the drip
[1:02:04] <%sandrews> those are really sick looking
[1:02:07] <%BlackMage66652> FORUM BADGES Kreygasm
[1:02:10] <chowndawg> it's expensive lol
[1:02:11] <Weberkraut> you can pick your portal effect
[1:02:11] <%Ixiah> you paid a lot for it
[1:02:12] <Weberkraut> they're all shiny
[1:02:16] <+Grayhammatter> it's the drip
[1:02:21] <Dogledor> and they are VERY expensive
[1:02:22] <%dasmause> @PatStaresAt thats your atlas portal, not your character
[1:02:23] <tanarath> Cosmetics are super shiny and also expensive.
[1:02:26] <+igniz13> They cost like $200 for the biggest packs
[1:02:28] <Man_in_the_Red> Drip is eternal
[1:02:31] <+bigslinglelino> spread da word
[1:02:34] <urkleturtle> the cosmetics in this game are A LOT
[1:02:34] <+Local16> pat going back to scumbag streaming for mtx boxes
[1:02:36] <Weberkraut> the most expensive supporter pack is usually 200â‚¬
[1:02:37] <+transporterthesequel> Yes you can spend SO MUCH MONEY
[1:02:39] <Enn19> So you playing this on release,Pat? LUL
[1:02:44] <temzzii> You can drip yourself the fuck out
[1:02:49] <%korean_random> costs like 500$ LUL
[1:02:49] <anime_dude> @igniz13 lol 200 no its 480
[1:02:51] <+transporterthesequel> Pfft the top core pack is FIVE HUNDO
[1:02:51] <tanarath> But it's giving the devs money, so hey? Buy free game, give dev money.
[1:02:54] <%Ixiah> run to paige !
[1:02:55] <%Dakuu75> One of the few games where i never bought any cosmetics and im happy with it
[1:03:00] <+bigslinglelino> I feel like I aged 10 years
