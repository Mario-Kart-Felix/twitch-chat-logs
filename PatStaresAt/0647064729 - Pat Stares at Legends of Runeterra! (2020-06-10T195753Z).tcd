[0:34:30] <cureneckbeard> centipat
[0:34:34] <Thewoodentree> Praying for a reaction like when Cr1tikal found a cockroach
[0:34:37] <%Starotter70> PAT, IT'S GOT THE KNIFE
[0:34:43] <%Ixiah> Is pat seriously praising a card game thats a close copy of Magic ? Oo
[0:34:45] <auspiciousdgg> I had a game where a Teemo put 38 mushrooms with 28 cards in my deck. I had 3 hp left, drew 5 cards in a row with no mushroom and kicked that gremlin's ass.
[0:34:49] <MyNameIsRasus> Animal Crossing go brrrr
[0:34:58] <Louie_Salmon> I would describe that value as obscene
[0:34:59] <iosephe> It upgraded
[0:34:59] <@SoFarFetched> no it updated
[0:35:00] <%Chichen> no it updates
[0:35:02] <%arancet> nah you get them as theyre added
[0:35:02] <leinadtonu> Should we tell pat if we see the centipede on the wall?

[0:35:07] <@SoFarFetched> they'll add more
[0:35:08] <%Agami23> no they updated and you got more
[0:35:12] <pennykettle_> 10,000 games!

[0:35:23] <%Ixiah> is paiges butt ready for ps5 ?
[0:35:24] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> tfw no sub message for cherry poppers
[0:35:25] <cureneckbeard> 50% of Pat's brain is currently focused on the centipede
[0:35:25] <%Mr_Pylon> they out more in. lol ripped off???
[0:35:27] <%DappercatEsquire> Centipede tilted
[0:35:31] <Estel013> shook about the bug

[0:35:38] <butthurtdave> Hey Pat thanks for streaming this last week, I downloaded it that night and I've been having a blast after having never heard of it. I like how friendly the game is to F2P people with giving out big money cards
[0:35:42] <%Coystick> Paaaaaat video games called me faaaat!!
[0:35:54] <%Starotter70> But what will you find?
[0:35:55] <%CrookedSpiral> Can Elmo protect you from the Centipede?
[0:35:58] <%Owkono> is there a centipede deck in runeterra?
[0:35:58] <Thewoodentree> yeah.......after
[0:36:00] <%king_wragles> Unless you see splitting, it should be fine
[0:36:00] <fabo_joyful> It updated and I think it counts the ttrpgs
[0:36:01] <SilverFaustX> so in 2 years
[0:36:01] <Lee_The_Limey> Pat's insight went up when he saw the Centipede Kappa
[0:36:01] <@SoFarFetched> That centipede will grow and become stronger in that time period.
[0:36:02] <%Chichen> woolieREMEMBERS
[0:36:03] <pennykettle_> oh for a minute I thought another AC fucker was coming down into your space
[0:36:04] <%Mister_McDerp> have elmo eat the centipede
[0:36:05] <%Valdorick> Pat's looking around like I do when a spider is in my house... or like when those FUCKING HORNETS kept getting into the house.
[0:36:10] <fl0wersnvrbl00m> I’m on the fence about trying this, I’ve sunk way too much money into hearthstone:/
[0:36:13] <%toastybites> The Centipede of Amontillado
[0:36:17] <%DappercatEsquire> You just gave that centipede time to plot
[0:36:20] <%flechet> just get a heavy flamer

[0:36:27] <butthurtdave> I've got a similar problem only it's mediterranean geckos
[0:36:27] <Darkmega97> Imagine if you found centipedes in your teratoma
[0:36:33] <thetransagenda> sting*
[0:36:35] <%maenos2> when i first moved to this house, there were so many holes, so many bugs came in. One afternoon over a 30 minute period, I caught over 50 stinkbugs coming in.
[0:36:36] <SilverFaustX> if theres 1 bug, there 1000 more
[0:36:39] <$TheSmerdis> there are cosmetics tho\

[0:36:47] <%Mendin> Hornets can be poisoned. Spray the hornet poison over the outside windows and cracks and stuff
[0:36:48] <Dragovus> ALL INSECT MUST SUFFER EXTERMINATUS!
[0:36:48] <GameOver_Here> I've spent more than $100 on Gwent, not sure how to feel about it.
[0:36:49] <fl0wersnvrbl00m> I like that idea
[0:36:53] <auspiciousdgg> I'm so happy I no longer live in a country with wasps and fucking hornets.
[0:37:00] <ShadeTheNovice> technically you dont have to spend anything on hearthstone either

[0:38:02] <SilentEric> Do you have a Teemo deck yet?
[0:38:03] <%Mendin> Pat have you tried Poros yet
[0:38:11] <%Mendin> Only epic you really need is Aurora Porealis
[0:38:12] <pennykettle_> you can filter at the top for just champs

[0:38:26] <SilentEric> No Teemo yet? Nooooo! mogwaiTeemo
[0:38:27] <Frostydough1> is that the centipede on steve buscelmo painting
[0:38:35] <Venchair> Champions have dupe protection thankfully
[0:38:36] <reonome> i have one (1) yasuo :(
[0:38:36] <butthurtdave> Make sure not to read/follow Chat's coaching during matches, it's more fun seeing you choose your own plays <3

[0:39:22] <eccentricprinceofroses> oh that sounds cool
[0:39:26] <RollCritFail> Pat Confirmed Hates Karma
[0:39:32] <eccentricprinceofroses> Karma is just Hearthstone in a single card
[0:39:33] <%Valdorick> Control decks
[0:39:33] <AllenDeadman> Iona decks are control decks?
[0:39:33] <Lutre> just don't get counterspelled 4Head
[0:39:33] <butthurtdave> Playing against Karma/Lux is like playing MTG/YGO where you wait 20 minutes for the other dude to take their turn
[0:39:35] <cherrycottontail> but deny doesn't exist in league
[0:39:36] <+R_BChe> ionian decks are the blues of mtg
[0:39:40] <nechronia> Don't worry, everyone hates Ionia
[0:39:43] <reonome> deny has saved my ass multiple times LUL
[0:39:44] <iosephe> just play around it
[0:39:48] <SilentEric> Just play Deny to Deny their Deny
[0:39:52] <MyNameIsRasus> Echo in the audio
[0:39:53] <%goose_attack_almanac> Always trust your Spirit
[0:39:57] <+gralho> bait it
[0:40:00] <%LokiDeathcry> What deck are you playing ?
[0:40:02] <Venchair> don't play big cards when they have 4 mana open
[0:40:05] <zamzoph> misplay
[0:40:08] <Darkmega97> Welcome to counter magic. No one likes you if you use counter magic and you will die alone
[0:40:09] <%Roasted_Pheasant> @LokiDeathcry Thresh Darius
[0:40:09] <Lutre> E LUL SIVES
[0:40:11] <RollCritFail> So it's Mono Blue in MTG basically
[0:40:13] <reonome> bait it or keep track of their mana
[0:40:14] <%arancet> he's playing thresh/darius
[0:40:16] <NiktenKing> play garbage spells to bait
[0:40:19] <iosephe> Play small spells first, see if they can respond
[0:40:25] <MyNameIsRasus> Never play any spell when they have more than 4 mana
[0:40:28] <%goose_attack_almanac> Just remember, Deny costs 4
[0:40:30] <%LokiDeathcry> What's Thresh/Darius theme?
[0:40:34] <@SoFarFetched> LUL
[0:40:35] <butthurtdave> Make them burn their Deny on your poopy spells
[0:40:35] <AllenDeadman> did pat learn how to make decks good yet?
[0:40:37] <eccentricprinceofroses> oh against Ionia it's better to save Glimpse until they target one of your dudes
[0:40:39] <eccentricprinceofroses> cuz they always will
[0:40:42] <auspiciousdgg> When will you enable the Mobalytics extension for Twitch?
[0:40:45] <Venchair> Uggggh I forgot elusive freljordians came back
[0:40:48] <SilentEric> Either bait out Deny with a spell you care less about, or have enough card draw to get redundancies over them.
[0:40:56] <reonome> shows your deck
[0:40:58] <Lutre> deck tracker
[0:41:00] <itsnooya> When you run out of mana first, it gives the opponent more room to play minions or counter you @PatStaresAt
[0:41:02] <SilentEric> Shows deck list
[0:41:04] <%Rumbutt> Lets people see your deck and mouseover the cards
[0:41:08] <Dracozombie5792> To beat dent throw spells you don’t care about first or wait for them to use up their mana then play your big spells
[0:41:13] <Frostydough1> live deck track for twitch i believe
[0:41:15] <auspiciousdgg> It shows us your deck and what cards do.
[0:41:15] <%LokiDeathcry> That seems like a way to get stream sniped, tbh
[0:41:16] <%Ninestempest> doesn't it show your cards and your % of drawing anything in yoru deck
[0:41:20] <%goose_attack_almanac> Seems like its a bit much given this is a second stream
[0:41:20] <%DrShellshock> Does it take a little time after being subbed to get invited to the discord channel?
[0:41:24] <%Ninestempest> unless that's a different app im thinking of
[0:41:27] <Enyoyable> Bait Zed
[0:41:27] <Frostydough1> there is also a seperate deck tracker for overwolf but ya know... overwolf
[0:41:32] <reonome> he has ONE mana
[0:41:33] <Enyoyable> Called it
[0:41:34] <Lutre> ew overwolf
[0:41:34] <zamzoph> Jebaited
[0:41:36] <butthurtdave> ELIXER
[0:41:37] <%Valdorick> Real Pat fans would just learn his deck then card count psaSmug
[0:41:37] <Venchair> he wasted an iron
[0:41:38] <MyNameIsRasus> For one mana
[0:41:38] <%Ninestempest> ONE MANA
[0:41:42] <butthurtdave> THE BIGGEST BRAIN PLAY
[0:41:48] <%Ninestempest> oh no
[0:41:50] <auspiciousdgg> You can download the Mobalytics app that gives you the overlay along with a graveyard.
[0:41:55] <Darkmega97> Big Depression

[0:42:04] <pennykettle_> Do you use the decktracker program at all? I use it to rate Expedition picks

[0:42:45] <SilentEric> That opens up a withering wail later though
[0:42:51] <mike2hands> those cards are the worst cockblockers
[0:42:53] <eccentricprinceofroses> or Guillotine
[0:42:55] <Louie_Salmon> He is burning through his hand, so you could totally shut him out of this game
[0:42:57] <%scrublord009> whats this deck?
[0:42:57] <mike2hands> and grasp
[0:43:02] <butthurtdave> @PatStaresAt are there any other decks you wanna build or need decklists for?
[0:43:10] <AllenDeadman> but the challenger can kill them if their HP is low enough right?
[0:43:12] <reonome> he's not gonna

[0:45:41] <zamzoph> Jebaited
[0:45:42] <iosephe> Yeah but that's all he needs
[0:45:45] <Venchair> yeah that's why he shouldn't have wailed first
[0:45:46] <restingbones> dang
[0:45:46] <WhitePantherZ> @restingbones did deny get nerfed?
[0:45:47] <butthurtdave> Man he refuses to let that Zed die
[0:45:47] <%Ninestempest> tfw people just spew deny every turn cause they don't know what words are
[0:45:50] <pennykettle_> still gets the level up sadly
[0:45:51] <sperium3000> I've been making a poro deck
[0:45:51] <reonome> should've still blocked
[0:45:51] <%Valdorick> BIG VALUE
[0:45:53] <%scrublord009> That's not bad
[0:45:56] <Venchair> if he wailed in response all the zeds would have lived
[0:45:59] <nechronia> See, if he wailed first all the Zeds would have survived
[0:46:02] <zamzoph> wouldn't have mattered
[0:46:10] <Louie_Salmon> Nah this was better, he would have copied the buff
[0:46:11] <%Ninestempest> no after is actually samrt cause now they're all dead as opposed to alive
[0:46:11] <MyNameIsRasus> Should've saved mana for Noxian Guilhotine
[0:46:12] <itsnooya> No, he would've cast the spell regardless
[0:46:14] <eccentricprinceofroses> chat is dorks Pat your play was good
[0:46:15] <Lutre> before he would have buffed zed and you'd have to deal with them all
[0:46:18] <iosephe> You have the 3 mana kill damaged units
[0:46:22] <restingbones> @WhitePantherZ yeah like 2 months ago? or more? before the game "officialy" came out of beta.
[0:46:23] <%scrublord009> I bet you he is sitting on protection for zed
[0:46:29] <auspiciousdgg> Summon the shark to feed Thresh
[0:46:30] <sp2729> you could have use the 3 mana
[0:46:31] <butthurtdave> CMON ELIXER
[0:46:36] <butthurtdave> oh balls
[0:46:36] <%Ninestempest> inb4 last elixer
[0:46:38] <sperium3000> Look at all this backseating.
[0:46:39] <eccentricprinceofroses> saving Guillotine is worth taking 3 damage
[0:46:40] <%Ninestempest> ahahaha
[0:46:40] <itsnooya> God he really wants Zed
[0:46:43] <%Ninestempest> holy fuck
[0:46:45] <%scrublord009> Yeah to be expected

[0:47:14] <reonome> inb4 2nd zed
[0:47:14] <%Mendin> Barrier wont do shit
[0:47:14] <dakkster> barrier does nothing against instant kill
[0:47:17] <itsnooya> Remember when Deny was 3 mana?
[0:47:18] <%scrublord009> ANOTHER ZED LUL
[0:47:20] <AllenDeadman> good trade
[0:47:26] <%scrublord009> FUCK THAT
[0:47:31] <%Ninestempest> LUL
[0:47:31] <Louie_Salmon> Barrier stops damage, not death
[0:47:31] <MyNameIsRasus> OOF
[0:47:32] <%GrumblePlays> Pat, did you get to RE7 when you were going back over the Resident Evil games earlier this year?

[0:47:46] <%scrublord009> ILUSIVE FUCK
[0:47:47] <%Mendin> Barrier stops one instance of DAMAGE
[0:47:51] <@SoFarFetched> @GrumblePlays No he's still currently on Rev2 which will be back once Paige is fully better.
[0:47:53] <%Ninestempest> is that just a 6/5 elusive and that's it
[0:47:55] <restingbones> Im glad to know that Pat and i feel exactly the same, when big elusives hit the board.
[0:48:00] <butthurtdave> Attack first, summon later
[0:48:01] <MyNameIsRasus> Get those neverglades in
[0:48:03] <Louie_Salmon> Alright, hope he find an answer in two cards
[0:48:10] <%GrumblePlays> ah, thanks @sofarfetched
[0:48:21] <%ChestMimik> Hope you got a challenger card
[0:48:22] <%Ninestempest> wow

[0:48:30] <butthurtdave> God Karma decks are so cancer
[0:48:36] <SilentEric> That is fine
[0:48:37] <khalcatto> sacrifice darius for direct damage
[0:48:38] <zamzoph> this is fine
[0:48:38] <MyNameIsRasus> He still has deny backuo
[0:48:39] <%Ninestempest> your only answer is atrocity and that could be denied
[0:48:41] <%scrublord009> If you atrocity and he has deny LUL
[0:48:43] <%EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries> @PatStaresAt patorc bivalve, are you playing online?
[0:48:43] <%Mendin> This is fine
[0:48:48] <%Mendin> Just throw the shark at him
[0:48:57] <+UltraViolet371> I don't understand

[0:49:07] <Louie_Salmon> I mean, you get 4/4s
[0:49:09] <Lutre> can still attack with shark, it'll die and darius flips
[0:49:09] <%Ninestempest> agree with shark play
[0:49:09] <dakkster> wit fuck
[0:49:13] <Lutre> attack shark and darius
[0:49:13] <MyNameIsRasus> He still probably has deny
[0:49:18] <dakkster> I thought that was the one that did two to all
[0:49:19] <$TheSmerdis> Might ahve been worth to atrocity the elusive unit with Darius
[0:49:24] <Bustahhwulf> is the shark good now or still win more kkenHMM
[0:49:25] <%Ninestempest> ... that is a bad time to play rimefang lmao

[0:49:42] <restingbones> @TheSmerdis Assuming he doesn't have a deny then yes, it would have.
[0:49:42] <critiquequartz> Who stole my deck
[0:49:43] <%Ninestempest> ATROCITY RAAAAANGE
[0:49:44] <Darkmega97> big shark energy

[0:49:58] <%Ninestempest> I KNEW IT

[0:50:01] <reonome> wow
[0:50:01] <iosephe> It's fine
[0:50:03] <eccentricprinceofroses> should've sent in Darius along with the shark @PatStaresAt

[0:51:01] <%reinbachthe3rd> Persona 4 Golden on Steam!
[0:51:02] <%Binary_Fireball> Binary_Fireball subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months, currently on a 7 month streak! I have nothing to say but I thought I'd say something anyways. There ya go. I said it.
[0:51:04] <zamzoph> silver LUL
[0:51:04] <MyNameIsRasus> Good shit
[0:51:05] <auspiciousdgg> RIP
[0:51:10] <eccentricprinceofroses> small thing but you should've attacked with Darius along with the shark since it would've leveled up mid-combat @PatStaresAt
[0:51:10] <SilentEric> mogwaiThink mogwaiThink mogwaiThink
[0:51:23] <xennyvs> Oh shit card games!
[0:51:24] <%Mendin> Not if shark was blocked
[0:51:24] <restingbones> For real though, Atrocity need some kind of Nerf.
[0:51:26] <%scrublord009> @PatStaresAt What decks are you enjoying the most?
[0:51:28] <+pectusumbra> but that would have made darius vulnerable to being blocked and killed
[0:51:32] <auspiciousdgg> You won by the skin of your teeth Pat
[0:51:38] <+wellshuckit> honorable Opponite.
[0:51:38] <%Starotter70> psaWink psaWink psaWink
[0:51:39] <Enyoyable> DEEP
[0:51:40] <Venchair> Deep is fun
[0:51:41] <Lutre> D E E P
[0:51:42] <eccentricprinceofroses> well yeah but it would've forced him to block it in that case at least
[0:51:51] <%ChestMimik> Deepdope
[0:51:52] <pennykettle_> That card that obliterates your deck is bullshit
[0:51:53] <MyNameIsRasus> D E E P
[0:51:53] <SilentEric> I hope to see Pat vs Peach or Woolie in this game someday.
[0:51:54] <%Valdorick> Time for D E E P decking
[0:51:55] <zamzoph> the deepst deck PogChamp
[0:51:55] <%Binary_Fireball> so deep so deep put her ass to sleep
[0:51:58] <%BubbaRands> D E E P DECK
[0:52:00] <restingbones> Dig down
[0:52:02] <pennykettle_> {GO DEEP}
[0:52:03] <Venchair> Yeah deep ditched one of Maokai for a thresh
[0:52:04] <xennyvs> I've been playing both a Deep Freiljord and a Deep Maokai deck
[0:52:06] <FirearmsInstructor> What the shit is this? D:
[0:52:07] <butthurtdave> I've got such bad OCD with this where if I don't have a 1 cost monster in my hand i start to hyperventilate
[0:52:11] <urkleturtle> are you saying that deck hits deep?
[0:52:14] <Venchair> it's to pull out an easy naut
[0:52:15] <zamzoph> thresh is part of the meta deep deck
[0:52:20] <+DraggoonLord> Chat + Pat, is this game as money heavy as something like hearthstone?
[0:52:22] <%MonsieurHedge> what is this curve lmao
[0:52:24] <%Valdorick> Deep deck them until they cry
[0:52:26] <%ChestMimik> splooshdeck
[0:52:26] <xennyvs> No
[0:52:27] <Venchair> It's super cheap
[0:52:32] <itsnooya> @DraggoonLord Nope
[0:52:32] <%Mendin> I mean Cursed Keeper into Draw 2 next turn is solid
[0:52:32] <Lutre> this is the most F2P game on the market
[0:52:33] <eccentricprinceofroses> it is not nearly as expensive
[0:52:40] <iosephe> Should have done the draw
[0:52:43] <nechronia> Its probably the cheapest online ccg
[0:52:44] <%holydeviant1> Thresh and Nautilus, then?
[0:52:45] <xennyvs> You get a lot of good cards pretty much instantly as well
[0:52:50] <butthurtdave> @DraggoonLord it's pretty F2P friendly, I got a completely viable ranked deck and I havent spent a dime and started playing last sunday
[0:52:53] <eccentricprinceofroses> the devs have stated explictly they want you to be able to get a full collection just completing dailies by the end of an expac cycle
[0:52:55] <%ChestMimik> @draggoonlord not right now, no
[0:52:57] <Louie_Salmon> Could have waited on the draw in case he tried something
[0:52:58] <%holydeviant1> Toss as much as you can, harrow with thresh out, cash money?
[0:53:00] <Louie_Salmon> Yep
[0:53:01] <restingbones> whomp whomp
[0:53:02] <xennyvs> my only complaint is how stingy they are with champions
[0:53:05] <iosephe> eh, oh well
[0:53:06] <restingbones> easy counter
[0:53:07] <auspiciousdgg> @DraggoonLord You gain 2 types of currency through play and can get a Tier 1 deck after 1 week of play for free.
[0:53:14] <%scrublord009> Neverglade is super good
[0:53:15] <MyNameIsRasus> That's sfine
[0:53:16] <SilentEric> @DraggoonLord Not even close. It is very easy to get a full collection relatively quickly with no money spent.
[0:53:17] <zamzoph> @PatStaresAt expect 2 mao, 1 thresh, 3 naut
[0:53:25] <%scrublord009> He going for your board which is smart
[0:53:26] <Lutre> @xennyvs if you play enough you can get like 3 champs a week lmao
[0:53:27] <Venchair> Champions are a gate but you don't really need many for good decks
[0:53:36] <+DraggoonLord> LuvSign Thanks y’all
[0:53:38] <FirearmsInstructor> Orange power, red toughness?
[0:53:41] <xennyvs> @Lutre how
[0:53:42] <RemnanTaka> TAP THE PORO!
[0:53:44] <reonome> probably
[0:53:46] <Lutre> Impetuous Panda's
[0:53:47] <butthurtdave> I think the direct damage deck doesnt even use champions does it?
[0:53:47] <zamzoph> probably
[0:53:49] <%EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries> chat who is mogwai?
[0:53:54] <FirearmsInstructor> Is this like MTG where things heal each turn? Or hearthstone where damage stays?
[0:53:54] <%Ninestempest> this is the generic deep deck
[0:53:59] <+superkeaton> This sounds fun and cheap. I got priced out of MtG Arena
[0:54:08] <%scrublord009> "Magowai's deep deck" is actually "someone else's". they have a podcast together
[0:54:09] <%Ninestempest> at most he'll have 3-6 cards diffeernt
[0:54:11] <Lutre> @xennyvs free one from lvl 10 vault, the scraps from vault, and good expedition rolls along with region rewards
[0:54:14] <zamzoph> @EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries pro player who people pay atention to for meta decks
[0:54:18] <%ChestMimik> @firearmsinstructor persistent damage except on Regenerate cards
[0:54:23] <xennyvs> @FirearmsInstructor they keep their damage unless they have regenerate
[0:54:27] <SilentEric> @EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries Mogwai does Twitch and Youtube of this game. He makes fun decks. mogwaiGasm
[0:54:28] <%EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries> @zamzoph got it, ty
[0:54:39] <FirearmsInstructor> @ChestMimik @xennyvs thank yo both :)
[0:54:39] <%EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries> ohnPrettygood
[0:54:41] <iosephe> Yep
[0:54:44] <%scrublord009> Fuck his vine deck LUL
[0:54:53] <%scrublord009> Swimstrim fans unite KappaRoss
[0:55:07] <FirearmsInstructor> Any reason he's not steamrolling his opponent?
[0:55:13] <SilentEric> mogwaiSap
[0:55:18] <nechronia> Ruination incoming?
[0:55:21] <%holydeviant1> I'm not sure I'm brave enough for toss decks
[0:55:23] <%scrublord009> he has mana to respond
[0:55:27] <Venchair> It's probably best to hold onto your guilotine for when the big sea boys come out
[0:55:29] <butthurtdave> bank the mana
[0:55:29] <%Starotter70> When are you going to play a round against the centipede?
[0:55:36] <Louie_Salmon> @firearmsinstructor It's like MTG with declared attackers and blockers
[0:55:39] <xennyvs> bilgewater and Shadow Isles deck....
[0:55:41] <%Mendin> Next turn sac the caretaker for a sapling and big drain kills
[0:55:42] <zamzoph> the mind games
[0:55:48] <%scrublord009> @holydeviant1 Deep actually lets you recover some of the tossed cards with nautilus
[0:55:52] <SilentEric> RIP Maokai
[0:55:55] <iosephe> Might as well
[0:55:56] <%Mendin> [pat no
[0:56:01] <%Mendin> aw
[0:56:01] <xennyvs> yeah pat would probably run head first into some drains if he tried to attack right away
[0:56:02] <zamzoph> -1 damage
[0:56:12] <awildgooseappears> this is some big ass bait if i ever saw one
[0:56:12] <%DappercatEsquire> Pat I know you're really focused on this card game and shit, but what about that CENTIPEDE
[0:56:13] <%scrublord009> Box is such a hard card to get value never know when to use it
[0:56:14] <Venchair> dead units are dead units
[0:56:16] <%Mendin> Shoulda played the 3cost creature to sac your 1/1 and make a sapling
[0:56:19] <%DappercatEsquire> bait
[0:56:21] <reonome> he's baiting you
[0:56:24] <butthurtdave> Probably a buncha Slows
[0:56:25] <%scrublord009> Jebaited
[0:56:28] <%Mendin> more kills, a bigger creature, and a sapling challenger
[0:56:29] <%DappercatEsquire> Or not?
[0:56:30] <Venchair> So deep decks end up with really full hands because their shit is expensive to play
[0:56:31] <Louie_Salmon> Huh
[0:56:31] <Lutre> a lot of them are units probably, sea monsters
[0:56:31] <+SouthPawKarl13> this is so scary
[0:56:31] <+gralho> big brain
[0:56:31] <dakkster> most are probaly sea monsters
[0:56:32] <%scrublord009> HE LET IT ROCK????
[0:56:33] <SilentEric> @PatStaresAt They might all be expensive sea monsters he can't afford.
[0:56:34] <iosephe> you're not nearly aggressive enough
[0:56:36] <FirearmsInstructor> Toss = ? (Discard?)
[0:56:37] <reonome> ?????
[0:56:38] <dakkster> too expensice right now
[0:56:39] <%Ninestempest> if it's deep deck he might have all sea monsters
[0:56:40] <%scrublord009> Ruination?
[0:56:44] <%scrublord009> AHHHHHHHH
[0:56:44] <reonome> LUL
[0:56:45] <Lutre> big ol timmy hand
[0:56:47] <Louie_Salmon> Ah
[0:56:47] <@Velyndra> REKT
[0:56:47] <iosephe> Ah
[0:56:49] <+Ilpala> toss is self-mill
[0:56:49] <+Vorpaled> deep deck is control. they only make good trades and pound you when they are deep
[0:56:50] <Venchair> Toss is discard from the bottom of your deck
[0:56:52] <%holydeviant1> Toss is throw out the bottom of your deck
[0:56:54] <%DappercatEsquire> Or he's got something planned
[0:56:56] <MyNameIsRasus> BOX THAT FUCKER
[0:56:58] <%scrublord009> Box not enough
[0:56:59] <FirearmsInstructor> @Venchair ty
[0:56:59] <+pectusumbra> could kill one of his to make it random
[0:57:00] <+Ilpala> oh, or from the bottom
[0:57:00] <sp2729> BOX
[0:57:01] <auspiciousdgg> @Mendin The nightmare the 1/1 cards would spawn won't be able to go on the field so it's a sub par play
[0:57:02] <Darkmega97> @firearmsinstructor Tos is self mill
[0:57:04] <xennyvs> Deep deck gets fucked by frostbite man
[0:57:07] <xennyvs> I hate it so much
[0:57:07] <jdanov> is this game multiplayer only or is there some sort of AI campaign like the older MTG pc games?
[0:57:08] <%Ninestempest> @FirearmsInstructor Deep is achieved when you hit 15 cards in your own deck, powering up your Deep keyword cards. Tossing means taking cards from the BOTTOM of your deck and you discard them.
[0:57:09] <Louie_Salmon> Box doesn't kill it though
[0:57:12] <sp2729> BOOXXX
[0:57:18] <MyNameIsRasus> Box plus chop kills it
[0:57:20] <AllenDeadman> don't box
[0:57:26] <%Mendin> @auspiciousdgg The nightmare would replace the 1/1, and the 3drop and sapling would be creatures 5 and 6
[0:57:26] <SilentEric> THE BOX value could come clutch.
[0:57:26] <MyNameIsRasus> Now don't box
[0:57:29] <butthurtdave> Even if he goes Deep and drops Nautilus, you've got him on the ropes pretty bad
[0:57:29] <SilentEric> He he goes all out.
[0:57:30] <restingbones> Box only deals 3 guys, its not worth unless he gets more units of the field
[0:57:32] <%holydeviant1> Nautilus I like, the idea of just dumping your strong shit for free is great
[0:57:33] <FirearmsInstructor> @Darkmega97 @Ninestempest ty <3
[0:57:34] <+mnrcarnage> @jdanov you can play vs AI
[0:57:35] <%scrublord009> Box and guillotine would kill but maybe not worth it since Nautilus exists
[0:57:38] <SilentEric> Nope, biding his time. Perfect for you.
[0:57:42] <Venchair> yeah sea boys are expensive as fuck
[0:57:43] <%holydeviant1> But toss =~=
[0:57:43] <SilentEric> Aggro him down.
[0:57:43] <sp2729> BOX
[0:57:44] <Lutre> 7 mana and two cards to deal with a champ he runs two of anyway, not worth
[0:57:45] <FirearmsInstructor> Deck size = ?
[0:57:45] <restingbones> Yeah, Thats how Deep decks do
[0:57:47] <AllenDeadman> it's giving me anxiety
[0:57:47] <sp2729> AND CHP
[0:57:52] <awildgooseappears> ok ?
[0:57:53] <MyNameIsRasus> SHIT
[0:57:55] <%DappercatEsquire> @FirearmsInstructor 40 I think
[0:57:55] <sp2729> BOX AND CHOP
[0:57:56] <butthurtdave> you can kill Nautilus right now with spells cant you?
[0:57:58] <AllenDeadman> well fuck
[0:57:58] <FirearmsInstructor> I should just look up a rulebook / guide lol
[0:58:00] <SilentEric> Noxian Guilotine is your answer here.
[0:58:02] <MyNameIsRasus> BOX AND CHOP
[0:58:03] <zamzoph> 6 away monkaS
[0:58:04] <restingbones> Box?
[0:58:04] <%scrublord009> you got answers for this
[0:58:05] <Louie_Salmon> I guess he's just waiting until he's deep to do anything
[0:58:13] <+Scevda> How is Pat feeling about the card game today?
[0:58:13] <SilentEric> Box into Guillotine when he attacks.
[0:58:13] <%scrublord009> I bet you his hand is all sea monsters
[0:58:20] <%Mendin> Box and Chop to keep Nautilus from recurring all his sea monsters on deep level
[0:58:25] <restingbones> Box right?
[0:58:26] <auspiciousdgg> @Mendin He had 4 creatures, replaces one and +3 spawn. One would have been discarded
[0:58:27] <Darkmega97> just play Raigeki
[0:58:30] <butthurtdave> YEE
[0:58:30] <+chippracoon> is this a easy care game to get into?
[0:58:35] <Venchair> yeah
[0:58:36] <+Mythicalbrit> no dont hit naut
[0:58:36] <Enyoyable> Naut gonna get gillioutined LUL
[0:58:36] <butthurtdave> and then kill a damaged creature
[0:58:38] <xennyvs> pretty easy yeah
[0:58:39] <SilentEric> Yes @chippracoon
[0:58:39] <awildgooseappears> many big bonk fish i assume
[0:58:46] <zamzoph> should probably do face damage
[0:58:47] <AllenDeadman> damage and kill
[0:58:52] <%holydeviant1> It took me a bit to get used to one action a turn only and the way rounds work
[0:58:53] <xennyvs> its not hard to find syngeries bc of reigons and keyworks
[0:58:53] <%scrublord009> This is a good try, I don't know what he has that could kill it
[0:58:54] <eccentricprinceofroses> hit nexus
[0:58:56] <+Thongalodian> Thongalodian subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[0:58:57] <%WhereIsWill> send em to the shadow realm pat!
[0:59:01] <%scrublord009> LET'S GO
[0:59:02] <+Scevda> Hey at least the AC is fixed.
[0:59:02] <butthurtdave> GG
[0:59:04] <%Ninestempest> lol
[0:59:06] <%Ninestempest> this is enjoyable
[0:59:15] <%scrublord009> This is super fine
[0:59:15] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah honestly doing face damage is probably the way to win here
[0:59:17] <%Mendin> @auspiciousdgg He had 4. He'd play #5, #5 would kill the 1/1, bringing his creature count back down to 4, at which point the 4/4 and sapling woudld bring it to 6
[0:59:17] <+chippracoon> thinking of playing it just never liked the idea of auto mana in card games
[0:59:22] <%scrublord009> THE YOMI
[0:59:25] <SilentEric> How close is Thresh to level up?
[0:59:30] <butthurtdave> Pretty sure you got him DTR
[0:59:31] <restingbones> Kill the life-stealer though right?
[0:59:36] <FirearmsInstructor> "mana" goes up each turn by 1 automatically?
[0:59:41] <eccentricprinceofroses> yes
[0:59:42] <%Treuan> psaBig SMOrc
[0:59:44] <%arancet> @FirearmsInstructor yes
[0:59:44] <%Jekado> yup
[0:59:45] <xennyvs> yeah
[0:59:46] <zamzoph> @SilentEric Thresh sees six of anything die
[0:59:47] <MyNameIsRasus> @FirearmsInstructor yes
[0:59:48] <%scrublord009> Can he level up Thresh now?????
[0:59:50] <%Jekado> everyone draws each turn too
[0:59:54] <%holydeviant1> Mana goes up one each turn and you build up a side bank just for spells
[0:59:54] <Dracozombie5792> Box saves him and hurts naut
[0:59:56] <eccentricprinceofroses> unspent mana gets banked up 3, but can only be used for spells later
[0:59:58] <butthurtdave> Even if he drops another Naut next turn, that'll burn all his mana so looks over to me
[1:00:00] <FirearmsInstructor> ty for all the answers btw guys, trying to follow along and learn.
[1:00:00] <SilentEric> @zamzoph I'm asking how many he has seen so far.
[1:00:01] <zamzoph> block with the 4/4
[1:00:02] <Lutre> in the emote meta heimer is top tier
[1:00:03] <auspiciousdgg> @Mendin You spawn 2 saplings the way it resolves it would leave the 4/4 until last, I believe
[1:00:04] <%scrublord009> NOT WORTH IT
[1:00:05] <%Ninestempest> @FirearmsInstructor yup. Every turn both players alternating playing cards, but whoever has the attack token moves first, and the token switches every turn
[1:00:07] <Louie_Salmon> Heartstone mana, MTG(ish) combat
[1:00:11] <xennyvs> each round, not each turn
[1:00:20] <butthurtdave> Thresh bonus
[1:00:24] <%Mendin> @auspiciousdgg Oh fuck I thought that only made 1 sapling ok I'm dumb sorr
[1:00:25] <%Ninestempest> @FirearmsInstructor it's basicaly twice as fast as hearthstone and there's actually shit to react to and it isnt' garbage
[1:00:29] <zamzoph> yep, that's why you bock with the 4/4
[1:00:30] <reonome> NICE
[1:00:32] <Venchair> the flip
[1:00:32] <butthurtdave> Guy fucked himself lol
[1:00:33] <SilentEric> YEAH!
[1:00:34] <%Ninestempest> nice
[1:00:39] <butthurtdave> KILL NAUT
[1:00:39] <eccentricprinceofroses> prolly shouldve used the 4/4
[1:00:40] <sp2729> CHOP
[1:00:40] <AllenDeadman> it works out
[1:00:41] <%ChestMimik> SKELETON TIME
[1:00:45] <MyNameIsRasus> CHOP CHOP
[1:00:45] <SilentEric> Save the Guilotine
[1:00:48] <FirearmsInstructor> @Ninestempest lol
[1:00:52] <Darkmega97> Spook him!
[1:00:52] <%scrublord009> KILL NAUTILUS THEN WE WORRY
[1:00:52] <reonome> kill nautilus lol
[1:00:53] <+Scevda> We soul fighting.
[1:00:53] <awildgooseappears> what champs does he have chat?
[1:00:55] <sp2729> CHOP CHOP
[1:00:56] <Lutre> guillotine naut?
[1:01:00] <SilentEric> Save it for when he tries to block darius!
[1:01:00] <%miguelrod777> kill
[1:01:05] <AllenDeadman> RATTLE HIM BOI
[1:01:09] <MyNameIsRasus> He has 2 mana
[1:01:10] <%EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries> CHOP CHOP
[1:01:12] <%scrublord009> GUILLOTINE NAUT
[1:01:14] <butthurtdave> Kill Naut, if he has a double, he'll have to burn all his mana next turn
[1:01:15] <AllenDeadman> kill nauti?
[1:01:17] <%ChestMimik> @awildgooseappears Thresh and I think Darius
[1:01:17] <Misfit_Tempo> burn them all
[1:01:18] <reonome> NAUTILUS
[1:01:19] <zamzoph> guillotine later
[1:01:20] <MyNameIsRasus> KILL NAUT
[1:01:21] <+Dre_> how many cards does he have in his deck
[1:01:22] <+EndgameContent> Save guillotine
[1:01:25] <FirearmsInstructor> Why'd he hit the 12 wall? Some strategy? (Now @ 10 health)
[1:01:26] <%Ninestempest> @FirearmsInstructor i have a very bad history with hearthstone and its shitty rng and monetization, but this game is SO much better in literally every regard
[1:01:29] <Dr_Suddenboner> play gwent
[1:01:32] <%SirGO0SE> save guill
[1:01:33] <SilentEric> No! Save it for when he blocks darius.
[1:01:34] <+EndgameContent> nooooooo
[1:01:37] <+Eamit> no reason to kill naut here
[1:01:38] <butthurtdave> Now attack without summoning and GG
[1:01:38] <%scrublord009> Now, does pat open attack?
[1:01:41] <Lutre> gwent players in 2020 WeirdChamp
[1:01:42] <Louie_Salmon> He can't even resummon it with that one card, good time for it
[1:01:42] <FirearmsInstructor> @Ninestempest do you need to buy shit? packs / cards etc?
[1:01:46] <+Eamit> you don't need to spend mana here
[1:01:48] <%Mendin> Pat cant attack this turn
[1:01:52] <Darkmega97> @firearmsinstructor to do what he did just now
[1:01:57] <eccentricprinceofroses> you earn cards kind of like on a battlepass
[1:02:00] <SilentEric> Swing out!
[1:02:01] <HologramInteractive> such a grindy op
[1:02:03] <+Brostress> hakashu
[1:02:04] <xennyvs> nice aristrocrat mugennPOG mugennPOG
[1:02:05] <FirearmsInstructor> @Darkmega97 I didn't follow with what he did because I was reading chat ;-; lol
[1:02:07] <nechronia> Neverglade last
[1:02:13] <%scrublord009> NEVERGLADE LAST
[1:02:15] <%Chichen> neverglade last
[1:02:17] <FirearmsInstructor> @Darkmega97 shit FeelsBadMan
[1:02:22] <%Mendin> Legends of Runeterra is remarkably accessible without having to spend any money, you gget a lot of wildcards and dust
[1:02:24] <+EndgameContent> sequencing
[1:02:25] <eccentricprinceofroses> neverglade attacks last!
[1:02:25] <xennyvs> inb4 double drain
[1:02:25] <restingbones> nice
[1:02:29] <eccentricprinceofroses> in case he gets killed
[1:02:29] <%scrublord009> LET'S GOOOOO
[1:02:30] <butthurtdave> GG bby
[1:02:31] <%Ninestempest> @FirearmsInstructor so in this game you get tons of dailies and weeklies that pile cards on you, including "wild cards" which can be exchanged for something of the same rarity. You can also just buy real-money currency and just literally BUY all the cards you want. You cannot buy booster packs.
[1:02:36] <AllenDeadman> that's a GG
[1:02:40] <Darkmega97> @firearmsinstructor killed Nautilus with a card that destroys a damaged creature
[1:02:41] <eccentricprinceofroses> perfect
[1:02:43] <%ChestMimik> You can shuffle the order without taking them off
[1:02:43] <Louie_Salmon> You didn't need the whole 3-card monty there but okay
[1:02:46] <zamzoph> yeyeye
[1:02:46] <SilentEric> Atrocity face with Box boy to win after blockers are declared. Maybe.
[1:02:46] <MyNameIsRasus> That's gg
[1:02:48] <%Mendin> And due to the themed b attlepasses you can switch between, you can semi-farm for the cards you want by just farming its faction
[1:02:51] <FirearmsInstructor> @Darkmega97 ok cool ty
[1:02:51] <%Ninestempest> So every week nearly you'll get 1 champion wild card and you straight up can get any champion you want @FirearmsInstructor
[1:02:55] <%DappercatEsquire> who needs board control anyway
[1:02:56] <SilentEric> Atrocity box to face!
[1:02:56] <Louie_Salmon> Well why wouldn't he block?
[1:03:02] <itsnooya> If he didn't block he wouldve died
[1:03:03] <+EndgameContent> Atrocity 4/4
[1:03:06] <%scrublord009> Atrocity will kill him
[1:03:07] <%Mendin> Atrocity the 4/4 and gg?
[1:03:08] <MyNameIsRasus> Aytocity to level up Darius
[1:03:11] <restingbones> Thats Slow
[1:03:12] <sp2729> RUINATION IS SLOW
[1:03:12] <awildgooseappears> thats slow
[1:03:14] <zamzoph> deep doesn't use ruination
[1:03:16] <Venchair> this deck doesn't run ruination
[1:03:17] <%Ninestempest> Ruination is slow
[1:03:17] <SilentEric> No fast answers.
[1:03:17] <Louie_Salmon> He's probably deciding what to play
[1:03:25] <$TheSmerdis> This guys hand might be all card steal going for the 1 turn ko
[1:03:28] <eccentricprinceofroses> some of them run 1 ruination actually
[1:03:29] <Dracozombie5792> Sac thresh at life for leathal
[1:03:29] <badknight007> not worth it I think
[1:03:31] <eccentricprinceofroses> instead of the boat
[1:03:32] <xennyvs> He might have an Atrocity too shouldnt he??
[1:03:34] <butthurtdave> Even if he's deep, he's dead
[1:03:34] <%scrublord009> HE IS GOING FOR IT
[1:03:43] <restingbones> *whale
[1:03:43] <zamzoph> D E E P
[1:03:44] <Darkmega97> that's so deep bruh
[1:03:45] <%holydeviant1> I really like Expedition, it's a fun game mode that fixes most of the problems that Hearthstone's draft mode had
[1:03:47] <%EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries> what does deep do?
[1:03:48] <awildgooseappears> and thats game
[1:03:49] <Venchair> big plays

[1:04:09] <+azure22900> Still lost
[1:04:10] <Venchair> +3/+3
[1:04:10] <%Ninestempest> it's fine
[1:04:11] <restingbones> but close
[1:04:15] <+Eamit> you should have waited and atrocity'd darius
[1:04:18] <restingbones> Neverglade might win this
[1:04:20] <%EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries> @Mendin thx ohnPrettyGood
[1:04:25] <%EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries> ohnPrettygood
[1:04:26] <Louie_Salmon> Probably still gonna win this
[1:04:35] <reonome> you still have 20 health goddamn
[1:04:39] <$TheSmerdis> box aint gunna do shit v sea monsters
[1:04:39] <restingbones> Seamonsters too big for box now but ok
[1:04:45] <FirearmsInstructor> How many "cards" / spells etc exist now?
[1:04:45] <Venchair> pat's won
[1:04:46] <xennyvs> This man is fighting for his life lmao
[1:04:47] <%Ninestempest> seamonsters still all cost 4-7 until he plays nautilus- nevermind
[1:04:47] <dakkster> seamonsters are 6/6 t lowest
[1:04:51] <%scrublord009> use the tree guy to suck the life out
[1:04:52] <+Mythicalbrit> he wins if he has atrocity
[1:04:52] <eccentricprinceofroses> rekindler in case darius goes down...looks locked up
[1:04:53] <MyNameIsRasus> OOF
[1:04:55] <+Eamit> if you waited and let darius hit then atrocidy darius you had it
[1:04:57] <dakkster> and now cost 4 at highest
[1:05:00] <SilentEric> Kill your own Thresh. with Sapling girl.
[1:05:00] <%damienlunas> damienlunas subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months, currently on a 7 month streak! Hey, Pat! Been working through a backlog of Castle Superbeast while I cook and exercise to help me lose weight. Down 4 pounds already! Thanks for helping me get swole.

[1:05:24] <Lutre> killing your own thresh will let it be rekindled, summoning another darius from deck lmao

[1:05:43] <reonome> bye thresh
[1:05:44] <Venchair> if you block with the regular 2/1 you win
[1:05:44] <@SoFarFetched> Oh I can hear that knocking

[1:08:01] <%ChestMimik> @firearmsinstructor drawing with 0 cards in deck loses the game
[1:08:04] <Darkmega97> Pat is meta now
[1:08:09] <%EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries> ohnYes ohnYes ohnYes ohnYes
[1:08:13] <%Dustwalker44> I really need to get on to playing this game
[1:08:18] <butthurtdave> One thing I'm not a fan of is the diminishing XP for playing lots of matches a day
[1:08:20] <TheFakeBob> the reward system is just satisfying
[1:08:28] <%Dustwalker44> psaBig psaBig psaBig
[1:08:29] <Venchair> You forgot to active the reigon
[1:08:32] <restingbones> don't forget to activate
[1:08:36] <MyNameIsRasus> Did not select Ionia
[1:08:36] <awildgooseappears> annnnd its gone
[1:08:37] <reonome> he didn't activate the region LUL
[1:08:39] <FirearmsInstructor> Who made this?

[1:08:59] <+Scevda> China
[1:08:59] <FirearmsInstructor> oh what is that.... the MOBA game
[1:09:00] <AllenDeadman> same thing
[1:09:01] <%Mendin> @butthurtdave I think they changed that, actually
[1:09:03] <FirearmsInstructor> LOL?
[1:09:03] <restingbones> Blixxard already has a card game
[1:09:04] <FirearmsInstructor> or Dota?
[1:09:05] <%SuckerPunchSyd> SuckerPunchSyd subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 18 months! 18 months! That’s 2 stream babies! Hope you’re doing well and having fun with the cards
[1:09:06] <cureneckbeard> hatsune miku
[1:09:12] <MyNameIsRasus> LOL yes
[1:09:15] <Diablo169> Holy fuck the chat on the IGN stream is painful
[1:09:20] <Winner_92> wait how did pat already max out all the regions except one
[1:09:27] <Winner_92> thats so much playtime
[1:09:35] <restingbones> @FirearmsInstructor LOL dude. chat just told it its made by Riot, not Valve.
[1:09:42] <%ChestMimik> @winner_92 you mean how did "grinding off screen" Pat grind?
[1:09:51] <Lutre> they're not maxed, they're at like 8-12
[1:09:57] <%Mendin> Pat's only grinding the first 10 levels of each region since that's boosted exp for newbies
[1:10:01] <eccentricprinceofroses> I think he means maxed to that chest reward? we're they actually all at 100%
[1:10:02] <Winner_92> ohhhhh ok
[1:10:05] <%Mendin> That's what he means by complete
[1:10:11] <Venchair> it's first 12 levels are boosted
[1:10:13] <Venchair> Iirc
[1:10:15] <%Mendin> ok 12
[1:10:17] <Winner_92> if he actually got all the regions to 100% i would say he has a problem
[1:10:30] <Lutre> been playing since beta, only one I have at 25 is bilgewater lmao
[1:10:34] <eccentricprinceofroses> I don't think you can even do that in 2 weeks tbh
[1:10:43] <%SirGO0SE> psaRaffle_TK
[1:10:45] <FirearmsInstructor> When'd this come out?
[1:10:51] <%ChrisPlaysThing> He has used up the Bonus exp for nearly every region, he hasn't maxed any out
[1:11:06] <Lutre> worth getting them all to 18-19 for the champ wildcard
[1:11:11] <FirearmsInstructor> @ChrisPlaysThing lol nice name :P
[1:11:14] <EuropanLamprey> Just got here, where's Pat?
[1:11:24] <Darkmega97> did the centipede finally get rid of PatM
[1:11:25] <zamzoph> battling centiepedes
[1:11:25] <Lutre> centipede got him
[1:11:26] <FirearmsInstructor> @EuropanLamprey taken by canadian FBI
[1:11:27] <xennyvs> turning himself into a playing card
[1:11:27] <%Mendin> Came out a bit under a month ago officially, but the open beta which carried over was since like november?
[1:11:38] <%ChrisPlaysThing> @FirearmsInstructor Thanks :D
[1:11:50] <Lutre> open beta was march? iirc
[1:11:58] <Venchair> I've been playing since open beta and have a mostly full playset
[1:12:03] <%SirGO0SE> psaRaffle_TK psaRaffle psaRaffle_TK
[1:12:03] <Venchair> you get cards very fast
[1:12:17] <Lutre> Nov and Jan were just 1-week stress tests
[1:12:21] <FirearmsInstructor> .... also wait why'd he go afk twice? First time he didn't answer door? Does he have an intercom or something?
[1:12:27] <butthurtdave> Math?
[1:12:27] <TheEvilOmega> pat is messing with his package.
[1:12:31] <%SirGO0SE> women?
[1:12:32] <+gralho> no :)
[1:12:50] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah they don't listen
[1:12:57] <%Mendin> Been playing in open beta, siting on 24k shards, and 94/30/15/7 wildcards so if I want new thing I can get new thing
[1:12:58] <%Gimmpy2143> Gimmpy2143 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 14 months, currently on a 14 month streak! More money for the baby psaGib
[1:12:59] <cureneckbeard> social distancing!
[1:12:59] <%ChrisPlaysThing> depends on what tho
[1:13:09] <parkslady> lol
[1:13:12] <%Jekado> They need to lick your face to complete the transaction
[1:13:12] <butthurtdave> I have the opposite where they'll just chuck the shit onto my porch and drive away
[1:13:13] <%SirGO0SE> give them a kiss :)
[1:13:16] <%Binary_Fireball> I just tell them to leave it at the door
[1:13:22] <%ChestMimik> The centipede doesn't fear our human plagues
[1:13:24] <%Binary_Fireball> it's annoying
[1:13:24] <Darkmega97> they also rubbed their dick on the package
[1:13:24] <+uselessbathhouse> did you yell at them
[1:13:25] <EuropanLamprey> "Here's your Covid-19 you ordered sir"
[1:13:26] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt Some bullshit about good customer service from a marketer who never leaves their house without being on crack
[1:13:34] <%dekkitout> I can't use "leave it at the door", triffling ass bitches steal shit in my apartment...
[1:13:35] <eccentricprinceofroses> that's not how we do in this house
[1:13:36] <cureneckbeard> put up like a sign saying like, don't do that man
[1:13:36] <Jetsfantasy> Spray it with disinfectant in front of his face
[1:13:37] <Venchair> people stopped giving a shit about covid it's kind of sad
[1:13:47] <%kknutson4> They're showing Yakuza gameplay in the IGN stream
[1:13:49] <@SoFarFetched> ELMO SCREM
[1:13:52] <%NopeBadguy> ELMO SCREAM
[1:13:57] <%ChrisPlaysThing> They just mark N/A on the south shore

[1:15:16] <Drusain> Wow Goodwill's out for you
[1:15:18] <butthurtdave> Has anyone got the Game Win with that "get x kills and win the game" lady? Everytime I go up against it, it just never works for them

[1:15:29] <%ChrisPlaysThing> rich people don't like that their stocks keep dropping, gotta reopen and produce something before they have to decide whether they can afford a new yacht
[1:15:34] <+azure22900> Bird's effect
[1:15:39] <NickCaesar7> @patstaresat Is there a code or something that you have that others can use? considering trying Runeterra and was wondering if there was a referal program or something
[1:15:41] <Jetsfantasy> Goodwill using that "nonprofit" money for cosmetics LUL
[1:15:43] <%ChrisPlaysThing> phooey
[1:15:46] <%DappercatEsquire> @butthurtdave Yes, in expeditions
[1:15:49] <AllenDeadman> I love the Cithria cards, I legit want her to be a champion on league
[1:15:51] <%arancet> no referrals
[1:15:56] <FirearmsInstructor> @BigCoffee yeah, I do too. My neighbor called me and said she WATCHED the guy walk over my lawn, go to the door, *READ THE SIGN* and then DROP the package upside down on my front yard. WTH is wrong with people?
[1:16:00] <%ChestMimik> @nickcaesar7 Runeterra is a free download
[1:16:02] <%Owkono> I do deliveries for staples and we gotta wear masks and gloves, all my wonderful calluses have rubbed off from being inside latex gloves
[1:16:10] <NickCaesar7> Free?!
[1:16:18] <%DappercatEsquire> @butthurtdave Wasn't the main strat of the deck, but it put pressure on them
[1:16:19] <butthurtdave> This is the same as the last guy!
[1:16:21] <runewalker01> Anyone else experiencing this game freeze mid-battle?
[1:16:27] <NickCaesar7> how do they make money? i heard they throw cards like candy
[1:16:29] <%scrublord009> I would get more cards but whatever
[1:16:29] <AllenDeadman> why are they like this LUL
[1:16:30] <Jetsfantasy> @NickCaesar7 Yes, only IRL money is spent on cosmetics
[1:16:32] <eccentricprinceofroses> did this guy DC wtf
[1:16:35] <FirearmsInstructor> @BigCoffee it's like, literally less than 20 steps to the garage at the side of the house instead of the front door.
[1:16:37] <Tucker0603> afk?
[1:16:37] <TurtlesAndTentacles> wanna know how stupid AT&T is? They send us a new modem cause our phone, cable, and internet keep going out, told us to put it in ourselves. I do it and the shit still doesn't work, so now they're are sending someone out tomorrow when they should have done that 4 days ago. why are these companies so bad?
[1:16:39] <Jageroux> @NickCaesar7 just on cosmetic stuff
[1:16:41] <sp2729> US Fiora?
[1:16:43] <NickCaesar7> PogChamp
[1:16:53] <%arancet> @NickCaesar7 cosmetics and you can buy specific cards if youre impatient
[1:17:00] <butthurtdave> confusing choice
[1:17:05] <NickCaesar7> shit. and I know nothing about League, so I don't care about cosmetics!
[1:17:05] <reonome> werid play but ok
[1:17:06] <%scrublord009> this is fine????
[1:17:07] <%Ynkubus18> @Owkono means you can get prestige calluses now
[1:17:11] <FirearmsInstructor> @TurtlesAndTentacles It's the minimum effort / expense required to retain the cashflow... I mean "customer".
[1:17:16] <reonome> WHY?
[1:17:21] <auspiciousdgg> @TurtlesAndTentacles Profits good, customer service bad
[1:17:23] <eccentricprinceofroses> this lad ain't reading your cards
[1:17:26] <%scrublord009> weird plays
[1:17:26] <+xpakeo> Umm
[1:17:29] <+Snorlax321> wierd play
[1:17:32] <%dekkitout> @TurtlesAndTentacles I hear ya on that for Att, spectrum's been better, but their routers don't have client end gui so if you wanna port forward they have to do it
[1:17:33] <+mental_mashup> This dude logged in once during the beta. Probably his second game
[1:17:35] <zamzoph> not gimplse?
[1:17:36] <restingbones> Guess he thinks hes preventing you from getting big value?
[1:17:40] <%ChestMimik> this man's brain so big he's playing another opponent

[1:18:08] <CruxAustralis> lmao the throws
[1:18:13] <zamzoph> didn't even activate it FailFish
[1:18:13] <%Rumbutt> yeet
[1:18:14] <SilentEric> @NickCaesar7 You don't have to care about cosmetics to want a different card back or guardian in the corner. Getting a different board actually changes the music too.
[1:18:19] <%scrublord009> OPPONENT CAN'T READ
[1:18:19] <AllenDeadman> nice beta player doodLUL
[1:18:21] <@Velyndra> @PatStaresAt it looks like the guy is playing a netdeck but isn't sure how to play it
[1:18:31] <butthurtdave> Is this ranked?
[1:18:32] <NickCaesar7> Oh neat. Seems like Riot did a good game.
[1:18:33] <FirearmsInstructor> What's the deal with the little fuzzy white / blue horned creature things? (Bottom left / top right?) Just cute random stuff?

[1:19:36] <auspiciousdgg> @TurtlesAndTentacles I've been working at customer service for 4 years now. Some of the places I worked at would rather lose low -profit contracts than send an engineer out because it would cost more that what they make from them in a year.
[1:19:37] <Venchair> wow a unkillable vanilla 5/5
[1:19:38] <restingbones> well... it could be worse

Just wondering if you'll finish P5R in your own time off stream, and also if you'll be interested in Valorant as the Anti-Cheat bullshit is easier to manage now. Pet the boy for me!

[1:23:43] <%scrublord009> NICE PLAYED
[1:23:50] <restingbones> @butthurtdave Yeah its a stupid card named unyielding Spirit. makes it so a creature can't take damage or die.
[1:23:59] <Venchair> atrocity range

[1:29:55] <%scrublord009> How far from deep is he????
[1:29:58] <Jontman42> just draw the correct card and win
[1:30:00] <@SoFarFetched> @Bailey__gaming you kinda have to play the long game in that one. I remember pretty much being in that area for a lot while where I pretty much kept killing things until they stopped spawning.
[1:30:07] <%BubbaRands> Pat trusts in the heart of the cards
[1:30:12] <butthurtdave> well make him learn from his mistakes lol
[1:30:14] <%scrublord009> THIS IS A PREMPTIVE BLOCK??????????

[1:31:13] <GarbageQueenEllie> "Heart of the Cards" = rigged shuffle machine
[1:31:14] <+CelioHogane> Twitch Extension?
[1:31:16] <+pectusumbra> it's just a side effect of the layout
[1:31:20] <Lutre> deck tracker has mouse-over for cards in hand
[1:31:21] <+Jttg> Ah nvm - just wanted to know what you were holding when you weren't clicking on them
[1:31:23] <Venchair> nice play

[1:31:27] <%Jekado> there is a twitch thing but yeah this game has no options mostly

[1:31:49] <@SoFarFetched> @Bailey__gaming I did heavy bolts and I believe my crossbow had Raw on it.
[1:31:49] <butthurtdave> yeah he cant Deep this turn during combat
[1:31:50] <%aishman> @PatStaresAt Put Thresh at last
[1:31:51] <fabo_joyful> NAW, Learn the cards nerds.
[1:31:51] <%LokiDeathcry> @alcett Mana points on the right side
[1:31:53] <eccentricprinceofroses> Thresh last
[1:31:58] <%dekkitout> Is the yank card the Thresh guy?
[1:31:59] <FirearmsInstructor> @fabo_joyful no u D:<
[1:32:03] <pennykettle_> so he lives
[1:32:05] <+xpakeo> Big brin play
[1:32:06] <alcett> oh mana around the turn counter? kk thanks
[1:32:09] <%ChestMimik> @alcett the blue doys on the right are Mana. Cards cost an amount, and your total per turn goes up each turn
[1:32:09] <+CelioHogane> So he levels up
[1:32:09] <reonome> is he close to level up?
[1:32:10] <TheFakeBob> the mana is next to Attack/End Turn button, the tics of blue
[1:32:11] <+pectusumbra> so he can see more deaths?
[1:32:11] <Saturdaythe14th> Usually better t put him last in case he levels but it won't matter this turn
[1:32:13] <GarbageQueenEllie> use exodia
[1:32:13] <+Jttg> Because he levels up from ally death
[1:32:14] <MyNameIsRasus> So he can level uo just in case
[1:32:15] <pennykettle_> @alcett no not really
[1:32:17] <%aishman> So he can see more deaths and hopefully level
[1:32:18] <eccentricprinceofroses> in case stuff dies so it levels up mid combat
[1:32:19] <Cymen90> @PatStaresAt Can you enable the plugin which let's us read cards?
[1:32:21] <%Bailey__gaming> @sofarfetched where can I get heavy bolts manuka dudes don't have

[1:35:08] <restingbones> YES YOU DO
[1:35:08] <auspiciousdgg> Thank the 7 and block naut with darius
[1:35:09] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah taking the 13 or tossing tresh is a tough choice
[1:35:10] <iosephe> You don't need to block
[1:35:11] <+pectusumbra> can you leathal next turn?
[1:35:13] <MyNameIsRasus> Darius, Thresh will bring him back
[1:35:14] <Kalcom> can't use spider
[1:35:16] <eccentricprinceofroses> feed Darius to him thresh will get you a fresh one

[1:35:21] <CruxAustralis> chat let him fuck up
[1:35:22] <%Treuan> The spider can't block a fearsome card
[1:35:23] <%ChestMimik> Eat it like the strongman you are
[1:35:28] <butthurtdave> Thresh will pull Darius back when he levels
[1:35:28] <restingbones> The second you dont block an Atrocious will finish the job
[1:35:29] <itsnooya> This is not a fuck up
[1:35:35] <+pectusumbra> Orb-sorb the blow
[1:35:37] <+the_krypto_knight> What doesn’t kill you makes you stronger

[1:37:52] <mike2hands> nice try
[1:37:54] <%Das_Bass> gg
[1:37:55] <restingbones> Come on, at least let him get the killing blow.
[1:38:00] <Winner_92> there's a super sick deck that plays maokai thresh and nautilus with deep
[1:38:04] <eccentricprinceofroses> aggro p much can't win against Deep tbf
[1:38:05] <%scrublord009> ENDURE Kreygasm
[1:38:06] <FirearmsInstructor> Resigning before checkmate? T_T
[1:38:11] <Venchair> Endure is great
[1:38:16] <%cha0tic_klutch> Lul
[1:38:18] <auspiciousdgg> Time for cheese
[1:38:21] <madogod> pat playing magic?

[1:38:31] <+xpakeo> Late game deep is big good
[1:38:33] <madogod> wait this isnt magic or hearthstone
[1:38:41] <itsnooya> Seeing the constant threat of deny seems so stressful
[1:38:41] <auspiciousdgg> EXCUSE ME WHAT IS BROOD AWAKENING DOING IN YOUR DECK?
[1:38:41] <+azure22900> Oh screw yasuo what a annoying deck
[1:38:45] <%scrublord009> Hecarim good now
[1:38:50] <eccentricprinceofroses> it feels like its got a game plan against every deck type
[1:38:52] <Winner_92> hecarim wouldnt fit in this deck theres not enough ephemeral stuff
[1:39:05] <Venchair> Hecarim is all right
[1:39:11] <SpookySpaghooti> Hey Patlords what deck is Pat playing?
[1:39:15] <Venchair> but yeah they don't need the reach he'd give
[1:39:30] <eccentricprinceofroses> it's Ionia they don't play cards until 4
[1:39:35] <%SirGO0SE> wut a hunk
[1:39:36] <reonome> wow already?
[1:39:38] <SpookySpaghooti> Is this just a generic Shadow Isles/Freljord strat
[1:39:38] <Winner_92> hes playing they will endure with elise and kalista
[1:39:42] <$Afterman_> oh hey its liam o brian
[1:39:42] <butthurtdave> swing for the fences
[1:39:42] <iosephe> attack out
[1:39:50] <eccentricprinceofroses> send them all in
[1:39:50] <zamzoph> all out attack
[1:39:57] <iosephe> coward
[1:40:03] <zamzoph> -5 damage
[1:40:10] <Venchair> there's the removal
[1:40:13] <%ChestMimik> No U the spell
[1:40:15] <SpookySpaghooti> @Afterman_ Liam OOOoOOOOOOOOoOOOOOOOObrian
[1:40:20] <iosephe> -3 really, but still 3 damage
[1:40:43] <nechronia> This is probably a bad matchup
[1:40:52] <butthurtdave> Get used to it, I hate it too
[1:41:02] <reonome> fuuuck yasuo
[1:41:03] <Venchair> As long as they who endure doesn't get recalled
[1:41:05] <Venchair> it's okay?
[1:41:07] <CruxAustralis> ah yes welcome to the "you don't get to play" deck
[1:41:14] <Winner_92> if you can kill the yasuo somehow this matchup aint too bad
[1:41:16] <rothgarbloodfire> sword man mean
[1:41:22] <MyNameIsRasus> anotha one
[1:41:23] <+xpakeo> Yasuo is one of the most annoying champions to me
[1:41:25] <%ChestMimik> Blue decks are still evil, all is right with the world
[1:41:25] <CruxAustralis> wait that was a missplay no?
[1:41:26] <+azure22900> Yasuo decks are such cancer
[1:41:29] <zamzoph> I know what's coming next round Kappa
[1:41:39] <auspiciousdgg> He's playing for early advantage, if Pat can make it late he's got a fighting chance
[1:41:41] <CruxAustralis> doesn't the blade twirler get stronger when you Stun things?
[1:41:42] <%Townspoon> oh snap you're the #2 legends of runeterra streamer in the world
[1:41:54] <Saturdaythe14th> Yasuo does a great job representing his league counterpart by being a flashy idiot everyone hates.
[1:42:00] <CruxAustralis> @auspiciousdgg no he doesn't because he'll drop the minotaur and Yorna and that'll be it
[1:42:01] <Venchair> yeah blade can get overwhelming
[1:42:04] <Winner_92> eventually they who endure will be like a 20/20 and they wont have enough stuns/recalls to deal
[1:42:12] <CruxAustralis> Pat needs to deal with Blade asap
[1:42:12] <Saturdaythe14th> Fizz is doing a great job with that too
[1:42:13] <butthurtdave> god i hate yasuo decks
[1:42:19] <auspiciousdgg> @CruxAustralis haha atro go brrrr
[1:42:28] <CruxAustralis> does Pat have Atro?
[1:42:29] <%saint_ham> this isnt qwent
[1:42:35] <mike2hands> oh GAAAAAWD
[1:42:36] <%ChrisPlaysThing> yasuo recall/stun decks are so boring to play agains't
[1:42:37] <Winner_92> this is good hes using his stuns on scrubs
[1:42:37] <sp2729> bring spiders
[1:42:40] <Venchair> Yasuo isn't an amazing deck it's just annoying
[1:42:41] <iosephe> You can concede now to save yourself the tilt
[1:42:42] <+azure22900> DOn't you just wish bad things to happen to yasuo players in both games?
[1:42:45] <%delilah4you> thats a good deck idea
[1:42:47] <eccentricprinceofroses> kinda overkill tho
[1:42:48] <CruxAustralis> if he is trusting Endure, then Minotaur will wreck him
[1:42:49] <MayorRev> Pat i appreciate all the sex noises you're making
[1:42:54] <NekoZen> wasting all the stuns on trash
[1:42:58] <CruxAustralis> it'll always stun Endure
[1:43:01] <Winner_92> and you can kill the yasuo here
[1:43:06] <FirearmsInstructor> No double block? Can't dogpile? Just 1v1?
[1:43:07] <Winner_92> oh wait im dumb lmao
[1:43:09] <%Mr_Pylon> this is a really funny stream to listen to because from another room in just hearing "Wow." "Hmmmmm." "Awww." "What?!" and insert swear.
[1:43:18] <butthurtdave> at least he's out of mana
[1:43:25] <%ChestMimik> @firearmsinstructor that's correct, blocking is 1:1
[1:43:33] <FirearmsInstructor> @ChestMimik ty
[1:43:40] <Saturdaythe14th> This guy is blowing all his mana on killing weak trash, he's probably going to lose
[1:43:55] <Winner_92> they who endure gonna be a beeg boi
[1:44:05] <nechronia> ?
[1:44:09] <nechronia> Weird recall
[1:44:10] <koolaid_kevster> Hey are youn gonna stream the playstation thingy tomorrow?!

[1:44:47] <FirearmsInstructor> Which card is that? The second one in pat's hand?
[1:44:51] <Venchair> So pat is letting all his small cards die so he gets a very very big card that he can throw into his face
[1:44:52] <iosephe> He probably has protection for yasuo
[1:44:52] <MyNameIsRasus> Save mana
[1:44:54] <auspiciousdgg> Fest Yasuo and Wail next turn
[1:44:54] <Venchair> it's the big ice dragon

[2:05:37] <Kalcom> not in expedition
[2:05:42] <%aishman> You need a construction deck all around her to win
[2:05:46] <Venchair> fiora's power is in consistency and she doesn't have that in draft
[2:05:47] <Kalcom> depends on what you get
[2:05:54] <Lutre> fiora is strong because people tend not to have answers to her
[2:05:54] <Venchair> fuck nice
[2:06:01] <Lophostrix_> hate that little shit
[2:06:04] <Winner_92> vimerdinger in draft fuck yea
[2:06:07] <%aishman> AAAW YEYE
[2:06:15] <93lobo> is stream in delay to prevent snipers?
[2:06:15] <Venchair> Fizz would have also been a legit choice
[2:06:19] <Lutre> beam
[2:06:21] <MyNameIsRasus> Holy shit Heimer Vi in expeditions? Nice
[2:06:54] <Venchair> far right is your best bet
[2:06:58] <%Nekros4442> 3
[2:07:01] <lordzaskez> yeah
[2:07:02] <WhitePantherZ> anyone else hear a buzzing?
[2:07:04] <TurtlesAndTentacles> like the song?
[2:07:05] <%maenos2> cataclysm was a shit expansion though
[2:07:09] <Kalcom> pure bois
[2:07:22] <%aishman> @PatStaresAt Also look for some mana 1 stuff to round out your deck.
[2:07:23] <+xpakeo> You ever get all 7 wins in expeditions? I always get either 1 win or all 7
[2:07:27] <BackwardCap> Are you winning, Pat?
[2:07:27] <Twoiis> Is this the equivalent of draft?
[2:07:28] <%holydeviant1> More shrooms!
[2:07:32] <Kalcom> grab spells bor you champions
[2:07:32] <%holydeviant1> More pain on draw
[2:07:35] <Venchair> racoon is pretty much just free vi damage
[2:07:46] <Twoiis> Cool cool.
[2:08:05] <Kalcom> gotcha is cool
[2:08:07] <Venchair> flash is super good for both
[2:08:20] <Venchair> flash is a free elusive unit for heimer
[2:08:23] <critfumble_> how easy is it to get new arena tokens?
[2:08:24] <%aishman> I actively don't like pool shark. But that's cause I have shit luck with him
[2:08:27] <%aishman> More Clump!
[2:08:38] <Lophostrix_> Cata again
[2:08:47] <%aishman> Go for the Trash Panda
[2:08:55] <93lobo> you can buy tokens with in-game currency 2k or get it weekly
[2:08:57] <iosephe> Clump is medium
[2:09:01] <%aishman> OH THAT CAT THOUGH
[2:09:01] <Venchair> trail is really good for vi
[2:09:02] <Venchair> and heimer
[2:09:04] <%aishman> 0 COST?!
[2:09:05] <%DappercatEsquire> does he have any removal?
[2:09:27] <%aishman> @DappercatEsquire 0 Removal has come up
[2:09:29] <%Nekros4442> 3
[2:09:31] <%aishman> Except Mystic Shot
[2:09:35] <%aishman> Oh yeah he does a few
[2:09:35] <SilentEric> mogwaiMushroom mogwaiMushroom mogwaiMushroom mogwaiMushroom mogwaiMushroom
[2:09:47] <%aishman> Get some Mana 1 stuff dude
[2:09:54] <+Alopekis> I thought there was no audio for a second
[2:10:12] <%qazwsxedc168> is he drafting?
[2:10:34] <Kalcom> GOLEM
[2:10:36] <extradopeness> Why aren’t you building an aggrocontrol spider swarm deck
[2:10:41] <Kalcom> guardian*
[2:11:02] <%SirGO0SE> ive only played draft for 3 weeks now
[2:11:07] <%holydeviant1> This is better than Hearthstone, where you pick ONE AT A TIME
[2:11:18] <@commanderclaw> Drafting and Deckbuilding are different if it makes you feel better
[2:11:18] <%GarbageNirvana> I feel like draft is one of the best ways to learn cards myself
[2:11:25] <@SoFarFetched> yeah I have so many cards on MTGA yet I havent built a deck LUL I just use the ones they give me
[2:11:25] <%DappercatEsquire> Always had best luck with early aggro
[2:11:29] <Venchair> toss the shady
[2:11:31] <Cactuskris> be glad you don't have to color like in magic
[2:11:39] <Kalcom> replace something
[2:11:45] <nechronia> He wont play anything worth copying early
[2:11:51] <%Gogogolem> What if i told you there was a draft tier list to help you
[2:11:57] <CruxAustralis> hm
[2:11:57] <TheFakeBob> Does Shady Character activate the Play: abilities of what it transforms into?
[2:11:57] <iosephe> It's fine~
[2:11:58] <CruxAustralis> awkward
[2:12:00] <%Nekros4442> I fucking hate Omen Hawk
[2:12:04] <%Nekros4442> So god damn much
[2:12:12] <%chiazamformerlymankeyfigh> I always replace all my cards if I don't have a 1 cost follower
[2:12:12] <TurtlesAndTentacles> is pat losing?
[2:12:13] <+xpakeo> I was about to say that @gogogolem
[2:12:16] <%SirGO0SE> draft tier lists are only good for first few picks if youre going to use them
[2:12:20] <nechronia> Save those for Heimer
[2:12:32] <Kalcom> kinda bad play
[2:12:32] <Venchair> just contraption next turn
[2:12:34] <extradopeness> These draws oof
[2:12:41] <%GarbageNirvana> How many flashes did he end up with?
[2:12:41] <$ZerephTheFirst> Are they still giving away the free rainbow poro?
[2:12:43] <crimsonsaens> @TheFakeBob no
[2:12:48] <TheFakeBob> ty
[2:13:04] <therealtacopancakes> have you unlocked the free poro and emote for pride month?
[2:13:07] <crimsonsaens> what an answer
[2:13:19] <CruxAustralis> ... why didn't he attack with baby yeti?
[2:13:24] <transporterthesequel> I feel like this is Pat’s truest form
[2:13:26] <+curiour> curiour subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[2:13:26] <extradopeness> Dude the yeti builds go crazy
[2:13:30] <lordzaskez> wait
[2:13:31] <jimmytwofeet> WHAT IS THIS NEW TWITCH FORMAT
[2:13:34] <Venchair> just save for heimer
[2:13:38] <reonome> lmao
[2:13:39] <%holydeviant1> Yeti is bonzers
[2:13:44] <Venchair> you want spell mana
[2:13:47] <Venchair> for when heimer drops
[2:13:51] <%holydeviant1> "Haha, 5/5 go for 1"
[2:14:03] <CruxAustralis> if pat pulls this back I'll sub
[2:14:05] <Kalcom> shoulda saved
[2:14:23] <%WhereIsWill> oof
[2:14:23] <%chiazamformerlymankeyfigh> why
[2:14:26] <KUYAmoPESh> Any plans on hopping on that Bungo Density2 season @PatStaresAt ?
[2:14:34] <extradopeness> Don’t chump your heifer
[2:14:40] <extradopeness> Heimer
[2:14:41] <iosephe> No
[2:14:41] <crimsonsaens> Heimer requires doodBigBrain , except it doesn't
[2:14:41] <nechronia> You get a ton of value next turn though
[2:14:45] <%nikoloas_> NO
[2:14:46] <%TrebassTV> ???????
[2:14:47] <reonome> WHY???
[2:14:48] <%TrebassTV> WHAT
[2:15:05] <extradopeness> Bro
[2:15:09] <%spitelite> but why tho?
[2:15:10] <Venchair> get that free flash
[2:15:13] <%chiazamformerlymankeyfigh> ummmm
[2:15:17] <extradopeness> Wtf for?
[2:15:20] <reonome> don't waste your beam like that pat
[2:15:22] <Venchair> turn something into a 0/1
[2:15:25] <%GarbageNirvana> Listen, if he doesn't horribly misplay how will he learn
[2:15:30] <Venchair> you can morph his cards
[2:15:42] <%Nekros4442> Hextech his right most card into a 0-1 pat
[2:15:43] <%chiazamformerlymankeyfigh> Oh I love that card
[2:15:46] <SilentEric> Transform your 0/1 into his neverglade
[2:15:48] <%scrublord009> what deck is this?
[2:16:05] <crimsonsaens> ???
[2:16:05] <%Nekros4442> Either make your own neverglade or get rid of his with hextech
[2:16:08] <Venchair> swing heimer too
[2:16:08] <extradopeness> What a shitty card that transmog is
[2:16:10] <Venchair> he's elusive
[2:16:10] <%arancet> heaimer/vi draft deck
[2:16:14] <restingbones> heimer
[2:16:16] <SilentEric> Just ephemeral swing. So Heimer
[2:16:27] <%scrublord009> oh we in expeditions?
[2:16:33] <%Valdorick> Is pat dead?
[2:16:34] <%arancet> yea
[2:16:35] <SilentEric> 2/1 just dies here. Play defensive.
[2:16:35] <%chiazamformerlymankeyfigh> buh why
[2:16:50] <zamzoph> ????
[2:16:55] <extradopeness> Bruh those cards just got ate
[2:16:55] <MyNameIsRasus> Pat why you posting cringe
[2:17:07] <zamzoph> ?????
[2:17:08] <restingbones> noooo
[2:17:08] <iosephe> wat
[2:17:10] <restingbones> why
[2:17:11] <CruxAustralis> why is he keeping his baby yet alive?
[2:17:14] <Amedamaneku> make the viking extra large
[2:17:15] <SilentEric> Ah, I see your plan
[2:17:16] <restingbones> I mean I get it,
[2:17:20] <restingbones> but why NOW
[2:17:26] <zamzoph> even the opponent is baffled
[2:17:27] <+DangerSmoog> Hey thats no fair. that guy poros blue and has lighning yours doesnt
[2:17:30] <+DangerSmoog> he's hacking
[2:17:32] <restingbones> nooo
[2:17:34] <reonome> rip
[2:17:35] <+AWanderingKenku> This is like the card game version of Feeding huehue
[2:17:36] <iosephe> F
[2:17:37] <Snookasaurus> thought my stream was muted for a minute there
[2:17:38] <Venchair> yeah should have played safe
[2:17:39] <%Nekros4442> Hextech something man
[2:17:43] <restingbones> Heimer Down
[2:17:51] <SilentEric> Save spell mana for your card draw man.
[2:17:52] <%Nekros4442> Take his Neverglade
[2:18:03] <%thelonechris> I've had the stream on in the background, and I've just been hearing "Goddamnit!" every so often LUL
[2:18:07] <%Nekros4442> nooooo
[2:18:07] <extradopeness> Yeah neverglade collector OP
[2:18:08] <crimsonsaens> NO
[2:18:10] <zamzoph> FailFish
[2:18:12] <iosephe> Why
[2:18:13] <SilentEric> NO!
[2:18:14] <%Nekros4442> You needed Neverglade
[2:18:17] <Venchair> nevergalde is murdering you
[2:18:18] <SilentEric> Aw jeeze
[2:18:26] <%Nekros4442> oh k it didnt matter
[2:18:33] <+AWanderingKenku> I'd do the 4/4
[2:18:51] <extradopeness> Oof and ouch
[2:18:58] <zamzoph> F
[2:19:01] <Venchair> I don't see much pat can do here
[2:19:10] <%TrebassTV> should've blocked the 4
[2:19:21] <%R3Roundabout> Losing mostly
[2:19:22] <%GarbageNirvana> So let's review
[2:19:24] <Winner_92> expedition can be a shitfest sometimes
[2:19:25] <%Nekros4442> A control deck needs play defensive until you can definitively have board control
[2:19:26] <93lobo> just to let you know I wasn't watching stream
[2:19:28] <%Nekros4442> Do not swing for no reason
[2:19:30] <+manny2510> neverglade and prankster anre awesome
[2:19:30] <93lobo> gj pat
[2:19:32] <crimsonsaens> You remember how you said your problem was always wanting to play cards when you have mana? DON'T DO THAT
[2:19:36] <TurtlesAndTentacles> draft is fun you Poob. which is a combo of Pat Noob
[2:19:38] <%nikoloas_> lmao
[2:19:38] <+MillerLowlife> just punch the other guy irl
[2:19:40] <pennykettle_> sick
[2:19:45] <%AncelDeLambert> jfc Riot
[2:19:46] <SilentEric> @PatStaresAt So my one piece of advice for Heimer here in this draft, plan the next turn ahead. You want spell mana to play spells earlier than you normally could.
[2:19:51] <%scrublord009> Update now???
[2:19:53] <pennykettle_> PogChamp

[2:20:44] <transporterthesequel> INFLLUUEEENNCCEERR
[2:20:47] <Venchair> shame no early vi
[2:21:05] <iosephe> questionable
[2:21:16] <%chiazamformerlymankeyfigh> I was so confused by the deck composition until I saw it was expedition, shits weird
[2:21:23] <Venchair> did they change her voice?
[2:21:27] <kscars> hi pat
[2:21:47] <%SirGO0SE> they added new expedition archtypes it looks like, and you & i just finished drafts neat
[2:22:03] <iosephe> take it

[2:22:07] <%DappercatEsquire> eat that hit
[2:22:10] <reonome> take it
[2:22:12] <%AncelDeLambert> come and play
[2:22:17] <MyNameIsRasus> eat it like it's groceries
[2:22:27] <Venchair> don't spend
[2:22:30] <Venchair> you can heimer next turn
[2:22:34] <crimsonsaens> I still need to climb two ranks
[2:22:34] <reonome> mushroom time
[2:22:51] <crimsonsaens> Yeah, he can do that
[2:22:51] <%DappercatEsquire> idk lol
[2:22:52] <%scrublord009> he is going for blockers
[2:22:57] <iosephe> Does this guy have a good lategame?
[2:23:02] <Kalcom> can't kill quick
[2:23:03] <+CelioHogane> So he wins
[2:23:11] <%arancet> he spent the mana to ensure you dont attack
[2:23:14] <+CelioHogane> DEFENSE SUCCESFULL
[2:23:22] <%wjones0415> yep
[2:23:26] <restingbones> Should have copied Neverglad, then beamed it
[2:23:26] <%scrublord009> All my dingers in the chat Kappa
[2:23:42] <@Moobot> I don't know if I can trust that. (@Amedamaneku) (warning)
[2:23:42] <crimsonsaens> @restingbones not enough mana
[2:23:50] <%scrublord009> Next turn copy his collector
[2:24:01] <%chiazamformerlymankeyfigh> why is neverglade so good, I love it
[2:24:02] <MyNameIsRasus> You'll get initiative after?
[2:24:05] <%Valdorick> Teemo Time, motherfucker.
[2:24:11] <Venchair> Neverglade is just a better prankster
[2:24:35] <crimsonsaens> Neverglade is so much better than prankster, it's not even funny
[2:24:45] <Kalcom> block quick with 1/1
[2:24:47] <Venchair> wow a real body and it's drain instead of burn
[2:24:49] <%scrublord009> Use the shit bot
[2:25:03] <+TestAnon> oh shit, I didn't know that's what that eye thing does
[2:25:27] <restingbones> @crimsonsaens What do you mean? When I wrtoe that he had 8
[2:25:41] <%scrublord009> Copy his neverglade
[2:25:42] <%GarbageNirvana> oops all wrenchbots
[2:25:46] <FelixQuinnNoir> take the neverglad
[2:25:47] <Cymen90> You PUT weak ass shit in your deck
[2:25:47] <crimsonsaens> It costs 6 to copy, 4 to beam
[2:25:56] <+manny2510> I'd attack immediately
[2:26:01] <nechronia> The turret is dependent on the cost of the spell
[2:26:03] <reonome> kill the collector
[2:26:04] <%scrublord009> Yeah attack immediatly
[2:26:07] <%goose_attack_almanac> Shady charater into never glade
[2:26:09] <restingbones> @crimsonsaens No i MEan use his guy who turns into a copy of another card
[2:26:14] <FelixQuinnNoir> wait
[2:26:15] <+pectusumbra> gotcha the 3/1 then beam the guy no?
[2:26:17] <%scrublord009> but still need to copy
[2:26:21] <Venchair> shady is better first
[2:26:22] <FelixQuinnNoir> use the copy and save one
[2:26:26] <FelixQuinnNoir> so you have neverglad
[2:26:27] <Cymen90> THEN? Why not now
[2:26:33] <restingbones> Why not do that now?
[2:26:34] <crimsonsaens> @restingbones okay, yeah that would work, my bad
[2:26:38] <%goose_attack_almanac> You can do it after
[2:26:49] <%scrublord009> And you have gotcha to react
[2:26:57] <Venchair> wompwomp
[2:27:06] <restingbones> @crimsonsaens No worries. I can see how that could be misunderstood
[2:27:08] <Venchair> resolve before you cast
[2:27:10] <%arancet> no, use spell first, then attack
[2:27:11] <iosephe> whoa, hold on
[2:27:12] <Venchair> err swing
[2:27:14] <awildgooseappears> wait
[2:27:14] <crimsonsaens> Attack after resolution, Pat
[2:27:17] <Venchair> yeah he gets a free block now
[2:27:22] <%scrublord009> Welp
[2:27:24] <%goose_attack_almanac> its fine
[2:27:25] <Venchair> if he's smart
[2:27:26] <%arancet> or hes dumb
[2:27:31] <SilentEric> LUL
[2:27:34] <restingbones> Good thing he is dumb huh?
[2:27:34] <Amedamaneku> he was too dumb to take it though so okay
[2:27:34] <%scrublord009> He just ate it.....
[2:27:47] <SilentEric> I'm glad Pat is playing against other new players.
[2:27:52] <%arancet> yay pats dumb beats that guys dumb
[2:27:54] <%scrublord009> VAULT BREAAAAAKKKKAAAA
[2:28:05] <crimsonsaens> Double Neverglade?
[2:28:05] <%scrublord009> That's fine
[2:28:09] <restingbones> Sadly (or rather luckily) replacing a card does not count as that card dying.
[2:28:16] <nechronia> Kill Neverglade asap
[2:28:19] <Cymen90> TCG players are so damn toxic lol
[2:28:21] <Venchair> that'll do
[2:28:30] <%scrublord009> We do it
[2:28:38] <FelixQuinnNoir> you dit it in reverse
[2:28:39] <iosephe> Yeah
[2:28:40] <Venchair> it's fine
[2:28:41] <+pectusumbra> WHOOPS. That works!
[2:28:41] <%scrublord009> we good tho
[2:28:42] <SilentEric> Wrong order
[2:28:42] <restingbones> Its fine
[2:28:43] <Venchair> you removed a threat
[2:28:44] <+manny2510> This game is so freaking good. This is way better than MTG
[2:28:45] <iosephe> It's better this way
[2:28:45] <crimsonsaens> That's fine
[2:28:46] <awildgooseappears> no u did good
[2:28:47] <SilentEric> That works too
[2:28:47] <MyNameIsRasus> This also works
[2:28:48] <nechronia> That's good though
[2:28:49] <reonome> it works
[2:28:53] <%goose_attack_almanac> Its fine its probably better this way
[2:28:56] <%JumboCrunchies> Oh cool big card games for nerds.
[2:28:56] <+demon1103> well, least he cant drain now
[2:28:58] <restingbones> Probably better to remove his while keeping yours honestly
[2:29:00] <iosephe> Perfect
[2:29:04] <nechronia> His Neverglade was going to be a problem
[2:29:09] <%GarbageNirvana> Between that and the shady you basically did a Captain Ginyu
[2:29:17] <restingbones> dang
[2:29:30] <%scrublord009> Use trash to block trash
[2:29:43] <Venchair> BIG BOY
[2:29:48] <SoushinSen> level up
[2:29:54] <%dekkitout> Brain Blast
[2:29:55] <%scrublord009> PAT YOU CAN KILL NEXT TURN. USING VAULT BREAKER AND OVERWHEL
[2:30:02] <+CelioHogane> He looks so fucking epic on that card
[2:30:05] <nechronia> Vault Breaker the fuck out of that stormlobber
[2:30:05] <Venchair> now you can keep dumping vault breaker on storm lobber
[2:30:06] <+manny2510> He's topdecking, YOU ARE WINNING
[2:30:08] <therealtacopancakes> God, Yordle are the best
[2:30:08] <Venchair> for free elusives
[2:30:11] <crimsonsaens> Vault Breaker about to go ham
[2:30:12] <restingbones> ALL OUT
[2:30:12] <+TestAnon> heimerbringer of death
[2:30:19] <Venchair> because lobber is an overwhelm
[2:30:20] <restingbones> ALL IN
[2:30:24] <Kalcom> kill this turn
[2:30:26] <restingbones> aww
[2:30:40] <Venchair> spread that damage
[2:30:41] <%GarbageNirvana> Coulda had lethal
[2:30:42] <Venchair> actually
[2:30:47] <%scrublord009> THERE WE GO
[2:30:50] <zamzoph> misplay, he was already 0
[2:31:00] <Venchair> yeah too many eggs
[2:31:03] <Cymen90> Why did you try to flex?!?!
[2:31:04] <restingbones> you deserve that
[2:31:07] <%scrublord009> 2 ilusives tho
[2:31:07] <crimsonsaens> The choke

[3:00:18] <+razielhex> @PatStaresAt When I transferred out of the military, my Household Goods were held in a Government Warehouse. When the movers dropped off my mattress at my new civilian apartment, the mattress had become a nest of bedbugs that suckled upon my wife and I for months. We ended up fumigating the place and dipping our cats in a sulfure water mix to ensure they didn't have eggs, then burnt the mattress.
[3:00:22] <%SvenHolgersson> Poro decks get fucked by so much stuff
[3:00:27] <Venchair> Vladmir is a pretty bad card

[3:11:09] <%Rakenshin> Rakenshin subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 11 months, currently on a 1 month streak! Hi Pat, good to see you play some other games. Do you like Runeterra more than Hearthstone?
[3:11:10] <restingbones> Why would you bother with the nexus with all those big threats on the board?
[3:11:10] <crimsonsaens> 3 to TF, 2 to Assassin and 1 to Challenger is the best option
[3:11:12] <%Nekros4442> He has no mana for Deny
[3:11:20] <%Nekros4442> That's fine
[3:11:24] <garbageheaphound> eat shit pat
[3:11:26] <%Nekros4442> Heimer lives
[3:11:31] <%SvenHolgersson> Somebodys getting fuckkkkkkked

[3:11:45] <%Nekros4442> Just play it
[3:11:47] <%Nekros4442> You dont have a choice
[3:11:47] <%AncelDeLambert> was that an Ez ult?
[3:11:50] <crimsonsaens> Play it
[3:11:53] <Venchair> yep
[3:11:53] <%scrublord009> YOU HAVE TO IT'S FLEETING
[3:11:55] <Venchair> that was trueshot
[3:11:58] <Venchair> ez ult
[3:12:00] <restingbones> Fate is gonna level up next turn isnt he?
[3:12:06] <%EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries> @AncelDeLambert yep
[3:12:08] <restingbones> He must be able to
[3:12:09] <%AncelDeLambert> fuck you Ezreal, you suck
[3:12:14] <%Fooguwu> Personally I like the name 'Pedmo. I like it so much I'm basically a Pedmo-phile! Wait...
[3:12:19] <%Nekros4442> I've legit never seen Twisted Fate level up
[3:12:20] <%scrublord009> JESUS HOW MUCH PROTECTION???
[3:12:21] <%Nekros4442> lol
[3:12:24] <%DappercatEsquire> I keep trying to mouse over the cards like a fuckin idiot
[3:12:29] <Venchair> his level up is annoying
[3:12:35] <restingbones> @Nekros4442 its really hard, but he becomes SO good
[3:12:40] <%AncelDeLambert> why, what's his condition?
[3:12:45] <Venchair> draw 8
[3:12:49] <%Rumbutt> draw 8 while he's out
[3:12:54] <%goose_attack_almanac> You gotta kill him asap
[3:12:55] <%scrublord009> Pat doesn't know tf level up...... this is gonna be a ride
[3:12:56] <%Nekros4442> Draw 8 while he is on the board
[3:12:57] <Venchair> his level is playing blue card red card yellow card
[3:12:59] <%Nekros4442> That takes a really long time
[3:13:01] <olaksi> @DappercatEsquire Don't feel bad, I've tried mouse dragging a stream to look around
[3:13:05] <%AncelDeLambert> that sounds... fucking awful
[3:13:21] <nechronia> gotta threaten him
[3:13:23] <Venchair> it's not the best level up
[3:13:24] <restingbones> @AncelDeLambert just gotta have a few tricks up your sleeve
[3:13:25] <Venchair> but it's not the worst
[3:13:27] <%goose_attack_almanac> TF will kill it next turn
[3:13:34] <nechronia> The 7/1 will get wiped if TF levels
[3:13:36] <%AncelDeLambert> thtas' some huge attack power on that popsicle stick you got there, Pat
[3:13:39] <%Nekros4442> You shoulda swung in with the 7/1 too
[3:13:41] <%Nekros4442> He's gonna level up
[3:13:49] <%DappercatEsquire> It's reflex from playing
[3:13:51] <%AncelDeLambert> play the popsicle stick with the plasma cannon, coward!
[3:13:52] <restingbones> pat, dont keep a 7/1 for defence
[3:13:55] <Venchair> it's a good animation though
[3:13:57] <therealtacopancakes> it is a good idea for a twitch extension by riot to be able to see the cards
[3:13:58] <Kalcom> TF is so strong when leveled
[3:14:01] <restingbones> hes it comes
[3:14:05] <restingbones> TF shenanigans
[3:14:10] <reonome> god i hate TF

[3:19:48] <nechronia> Replace suit up
[3:19:56] <+Tomfom25> whats happen to the persona 5 royal streams
[3:19:56] <Kalcom> drop suit up
[3:19:59] <Venchair> mystic only is fine
[3:19:59] <NekoZen> you have nothing to protect heimer
[3:19:59] <Decarcassor> keep Heimer
[3:20:00] <Destructor_Delta> keep the donger
[3:20:07] <Venchair> heimer is dead in hand
[3:20:07] <+Dre_> keep donger
[3:20:10] <Monkeyweed21> you want your starting hand to be shit you can play
[3:20:12] <%DappercatEsquire> unless you get lucky on the draw
[3:20:12] <%SirGO0SE> 98% of the time if something doesnt cost 1 or 2 i dont keep it
[3:20:13] <restingbones> You got 3 heimers right?
[3:20:16] <%SvenHolgersson> Suit up is horrible for starting hand
[3:20:16] <%scrublord009> suit up is cheaper when drawn
[3:20:17] <%Nekros4442> Yep
[3:20:19] <+pectusumbra> P5R got benched due to other stuff, it being a pain, and general JRPG fatigue
[3:20:21] <+theaceclaw> LUL
[3:20:21] <HibikiYamada> @Tomfom25 you're looking at the reason why lmao
[3:20:22] <Destructor_Delta> soz
[3:20:23] <%UvBenServed> LUL
[3:20:24] <%emperordread> Double your Dinger
[3:20:25] <restingbones> TOLD YA

[3:20:45] <%SvenHolgersson> He'd be correct
[3:20:46] <+akikyou> Maybe
[3:20:47] <restingbones> incoming value
[3:20:51] <%DappercatEsquire> that's the bet
[3:20:51] <Monkeyweed21> Well.....
[3:20:55] <+Tomfom25> yeah that makes sense i guess i bought it recently cuz of pats streams
[3:20:58] <%Valdorick> Those aren't exclusive psaSmug
[3:21:12] <@SoFarFetched> Well main reason for P5R being benched was because all the new content was pretty much at the end and it would be a bunch of hours to get to it.
[3:21:12] <%scrublord009> swing first
[3:21:29] <Venchair> Trail is just a cheap flash
[3:21:30] <@SoFarFetched> also not much viewers on those streams.
[3:21:33] <%scrublord009> good pass
[3:21:44] <+Tomfom25> thats a fair reason
[3:21:46] <%SvenHolgersson> Keep that boner in your pants young man
[3:21:49] <@SoFarFetched> the last P5R stream ended on a high note anyway LUL
[3:21:58] <%scrublord009> YOU CAN KILL MS FORTUNE NOW BUT BE CAREFUL
[3:22:00] <%Nekros4442> Shoot Nexus/Fortune with 4cost imo
[3:22:07] <+marlborored5> @PatStaresAt you have 3 damage to kill miss fortune
[3:22:16] <Venchair> killing mf now leaves him empty for heimer

[3:51:02] <MyNameIsRasus> That's a big hit
[3:51:05] <Kalcom> he has no mana
[3:51:05] <+pectusumbra> he has not options
[3:51:12] <Venchair> quick attack is only on attack not on block

[3:51:24] <%Ninestempest> wow he ate that
[3:51:37] <+pectusumbra> in a card game, a person having NO mana is like full stagger.
[3:51:38] <Kalcom> he's playing risky
[3:51:38] <%holydeviant1> No shroom draws yet
[3:51:40] <@Velyndra> big brain play use the 6 mana spell to turn the 1/1 into the 6/6
[3:51:41] <%DappercatEsquire> least you didn't drop 6 mana instead of 4 for it to die
[3:51:44] <%scrublord009> Copy again?
[3:51:50] <+pectusumbra> that's not bad yeah
[3:52:01] <Venchair> good it went through
[3:52:04] <zamzoph> that was super risky
[3:52:07] <MyNameIsRasus> Risky but worked out
[3:52:09] <Kalcom> he's gonna shoot it
[3:52:13] <LazyLudens> a copy of a copy, damn
[3:52:13] <Kalcom> or not
[3:52:14] <%weissguard> That's something to think about.
[3:52:16] <Venchair> ehh?
[3:52:21] <%scrublord009> Vault breaker only when you are sure it will kill
[3:52:21] <nechronia> Eventually Pat will mess up and turn his 6/6 into a 1/1
[3:52:25] <%holydeviant1> Vulnerable is a pain
[3:52:26] <COMB711> That seems awful for him
[3:52:26] <SGrim> Also fine. Annoying, but fine
