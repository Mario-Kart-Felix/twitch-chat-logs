[0:09:02] <%SunnyVarietyPack> Cheer500 Pat the original FF7 came out 2 months after I was born, I know am pursuing a masters degree at grad school
[0:09:03] <+im_just_shiny> I've literally waited years of this to actually be a reality. Seriously excited for the remake
[0:09:03] <%CursedNobleman> The snitch materia is yellow. overrated

[0:09:22] <%Typhaeon> Whatever I forget how FF8 worked
[0:09:22] <WarchiefGoldva> The best part about the remake aside from itself is that it created a resurgence of Tifa hentai and that makes me the happiest.
[0:09:25] <%collind99> Also the voice cast for this game is pretty hot as well. Cloud and Seph’s voice actors are himbos
[0:09:27] <%Fenrirlives> I just want Hell House to still be in the game
[0:09:38] <%CursedNobleman> FF9 Item crafting and AP was the best system

[0:36:31] <jorniev> they did not get to shoot
[0:36:32] <Guyshane> This game just begs to be screencapped at every single moment
[0:36:32] <$lotharrio> Text them to Woolie and make him annoyed.
[0:36:32] <%Owkono> good old clumbo
[0:36:33] <@StridentSong> Pat is going into this completely blind. Keep that in mind when talking about it
[0:36:38] <+CelioHogane> @Too_Much_Nukie shh, spoilers!
[0:36:40] <ShoMibu> Well I mean is it like the exsact same story as the orginal ff7? Or are there twists?

[0:36:53] <%pipboy344> @shomibu Twists
[0:36:54] <WarchiefGoldva> I love how they say different things HERE, specifically, depending if you used Magic, Focused Thrust or Braver. It's awesome.

[0:37:20] <Shishi1205> You keep that mf sword on you stride
[0:37:20] <%coreyyotto> At least slow mode for a little, might be a good idea

[0:37:37] <%moogleboy1984> @muniea3 Biggs is the Charley Sheen guy. Wedge is the chonker
[0:37:38] <%Buzzard42> I LOVE his trash talk
[0:37:38] <HyperBomb21> Biggs is "anime fat". Meaning his obesity is purely aesthetical
[0:37:39] <%stemlo_> Wait. Biggs? Wedge? Are they named after X-Wing pilots?
[0:37:39] <%Hellarussian> number go up
[0:37:40] <Zer0beats> he killed them

[0:37:58] <+BubbaRands> THOUGHT
[0:38:00] <$FluffiTamamo> Cloud has a great sword and clothes still on. Shouldn’t he have fat roll?
[0:38:00] <darkmind95> When are Donald and Goofy gonna face this guy at the coloseum?
[0:38:00] <Theonlypegsus> Mmmmm delicious textures
[0:38:02] <%suikudo> @PatStaresAt How loud is your ps4 screaming right now?
[0:38:04] <Tha_Mik> Cloud thinks he's so cool

[0:38:19] <FrankysDream> wait just one second this is just the demo again they tricked us
[0:38:19] <+schlager087> Waiting for some dlc to give classic skins
[0:38:19] <+RayDaug> Clouds pants are like MC hammer baggy
[0:38:21] <DesertPenguin> If game is louder enough you don't have to hear it
[0:38:23] <%debugdrawray_> are you on ps4 pro or normal

[0:38:27] <+schlager087> i need that low poly goodness
[0:38:32] <jorniev> man they really should think about remaking 6 a few years after this remake is done
[0:38:32] <%cowardman93> the Pro seems to handle the game fine
[0:38:32] <+jetjagger222> BGM is p gud
[0:38:34] <%Hellarussian> no chance
[0:38:37] <majima666> man, my ps4 sounds like a jet engine with games like doom and rdr2
[0:38:37] <%Ultimatefool> Turn up the TV to drown out the PS4 suffering
[0:38:38] <Wafflez1909> It's real neat that cloud got his own spin off from kingdom hearts, i wonder when sora will show up
[0:38:41] <piratekingboros> I'm MOST excited for the new Zack cutscenes we're obviously gonna get!!!!
[0:38:42] <+CelioHogane> @schlager087 low poly Cloud should be a skin
[0:38:44] <WarchiefGoldva> Can't fire out of battle!
[0:38:46] <jorniev> BGM SLAPS
[0:38:47] <%bluetocho13> if your ps4 is screaming that means you need to clean it
[0:38:48] <$lotharrio> I could go for a solid FF6 remake.
[0:38:49] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt I am a little diappointed that you can't name party members in this. Clumbo will be missed
[0:38:50] <hot4dukat> ya crazytalk!
[0:38:51] <ghostspartan80> apparently its 100 gigs
[0:38:52] <de1ete_forever> mine has a custom heat sink and fan
[0:38:53] <%pipboy344> !CONSOLE OVERHEATING!
[0:38:53] <Shishi1205> you can put it in shortcut like in the demo @PatStaresAt
[0:38:53] <+schlager087> I would buy immediately
[0:38:55] <+BubbaRands> Not screaming loudly, but definitely voicing its complaints
[0:38:56] <%Dragon_Batman> Nice PAt LUL
[0:38:56] <%TalisKanju> A 6 remake will NEVER HAPPEN (unless it's like a mobile game or something)
[0:38:59] <%Taisuru> I think so, agree
[0:38:59] <HeadsHeldHigh> english
[0:39:00] <%BoomerUnchained> Think so agree
[0:39:01] <Ipsenscastle> @jorniev I'd be double hype for a 6 remake

[0:40:43] <ItsZelus> Take a shot everytime someone mentions that Wedge sounds like Badger
[0:40:43] <%SpcOpsBear> Wedge is literally how I'll be if I ended up in a citizen's militia if the world went to shit - fat and not able to stomach it

[0:41:08] <+Bear_Mane> dude looks like a gears of war character
[0:41:08] <+FrostMass22> @vritrareirei The issue is that this is not an original story. If this was FF16 it might be one thing. The gameplay might be good but story to a game is important. Why would I care about a game that has a story when I could just play a good game with close to no story like Doom 2016?
[0:41:10] <assfordayz> The whole 500

[0:45:40] <Shishi1205> @PatStaresAt before the room with the elevator where the dog pops up its the chest
[0:45:41] <DesertPenguin> So is this just an action rpg now?
[0:45:41] <+evilpaul13> did he pick up the Neo-Bahumat materia?

[0:45:55] <+chaumiester> Ah, shit I'm late to the stream
[0:45:58] <%mighty_max_t> Just woke up. Have I missed anything not in the demo?
[0:45:58] <+CelioHogane> @Too_Much_Nukie nah it's just a non copyright breaking displacer beast.
[0:45:59] <%Taisuru> Can you show off the turn based mode?
[0:46:00] <%dashmatt> It's ok guys, someone will adopt that dog as a rescue dog
[0:46:01] <sjcodan> GIT GUD
[0:46:02] <%dukenux> psaBad
[0:46:02] <Shishi1205> Its in a hallwayy

[0:46:05] <TheFranss> heal go UP
[0:46:07] <%Dragon_Batman> @mighty_max_t Not yet
[0:46:09] <%Ultimatefool> le guard botton
[0:46:09] <+akira_chong> This is just the FFXV combat system with button presses
[0:46:10] <DesertPenguin> @Taisuru It's an option?!
[0:46:11] <saiyan24675> psaUp
[0:46:12] <WhoLovesOrangeSoda> oddoneDuel
[0:46:13] <%gespenst25> No way Barette fit through that hole.
[0:46:13] <muniea3> Cloud shaped hole in the fence
[0:46:13] <ShoMibu> But pat, its a action rpg, how can this be right, FF suppose to be a menu driven rpg Kappa
[0:46:15] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @ianrazz Ill beat my sack if I want. U cant stop me
[0:46:17] <otakon17> yeah it seems like you constantly take damage in this one
[0:46:18] <%griffball13> what if he needs them elixers later
[0:46:23] <42nfl19> Are there any skins to unlock/buy? @PatStaresAt
[0:46:24] <Wafflez1909> god, 15 combat was awful
[0:46:25] <%Dragon_Batman> The one guy who told him the start was at fault
[0:46:25] <+chaumiester> I keep forgetting Pat is a hour ahead of me
[0:46:26] <%mighty_max_t> Cool. Thanks @Dragon_Batman
[0:46:28] <Ianrazz> @BallerSwagBro9k d69Fight
[0:46:31] <robo_badger> That feeling when the company gives dogs better equipement than humans
[0:46:32] <%Taisuru> @DesertPenguin It's apparently not ACTUALLY turn based but yeah
[0:46:34] <jorniev> ok the coolest thing about guys with giant great swords is that they swing them like they were made of paper
[0:46:37] <%BoomerUnchained> Drive forklift
[0:46:41] <%rytyoung> @desertpenguin Its called classic mode
[0:46:42] <%VritraReiRei> @FrostMass22 yeah but you are basing your opinion on the game from some possible leaks before enjoying the game. it's akin to reading the entire synopsis of a movie before going to see it and thinking, "yeah this movie sucks," before even seeing a minute of it. If you liked the original FFVII you cant be telling me you dont like the music right now? or the modern backgrounds? You should enjoy a game as it is, and not what you expect it to be
[0:46:45] <sjcodan> PAT, YOU MISSED THAT CHEST YOU JUST OPENED
[0:46:47] <ShoMibu> Now you know what i want to be remade like this. <.< legend of lagaia.
[0:46:49] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @gespenst25 Help me Merc! I'm trying to infiltrate the mako reactor but my ass is too dummy thicc and I can't get through the fence!
[0:46:50] <%griffball13> hey pat you missed that chest you just got
[0:46:54] <Hepathos87> @DesertPenguin kinda, but you have stances, and can star a time focus where you can select magic attacks and items during fight
[0:46:57] <%gespenst25> I hope you can play the whole game as dress cloud

[0:49:31] <%Too_Much_Nukie> I like how this remake is already making Cloud feel like the badass everyone says he is. In the original you feel pretty weak at the start.
[0:49:32] <draugrix> "we can take him" cloud kills them all in the same combo
[0:49:34] <WarchiefGoldva> Command sucks.

[1:00:36] <+BubbaRands> ooo-ooh....
[1:00:36] <+schlager087> Pls don't bully me Mr. Barret
[1:00:37] <Sokumotanaka> Barret WOULD listen to live and learn
[1:00:39] <AEUG_Ace_Kamille> Him hitting those red barrels fucking spooked me.
[1:00:39] <%Flambage> @PatStaresAt What is the schedule going to be with this game and the other games?
[1:00:40] <%VashyronM> I guess being aloof has it's disadvantages, eh Cloud?
[1:00:41] <%Hellarussian> use Cura for that burn
[1:00:41] <%happyface699> Oh cloud
[1:00:42] <+sunriser101> man, imagine a ff6 remake on this engine
[1:00:42] <YakumoYomi> @Guardiansaiyan Most of the journalists seemed to have already played it. There were around 80 reviews on Metacritic when I checked yesterday.
[1:00:43] <%moogleboy1984> Quick, Aeris, Esuna me
[1:00:44] <jorniev> AND HE IS STILL MOPING ABOUT IT
[1:00:46] <Diablo169> those red barrels didnt blow up. thats not right
[1:00:50] <AEUG_Ace_Kamille> Thought they were gonna blow up.
[1:00:51] <%SoFarFetched> @Flambage It's on his twitter.
[1:00:52] <+miakhalifaisoverrated> This makes me wanna play the original. Never played it
[1:00:54] <ShoMibu> Secretly cloud might be into the whole bully me thing.
[1:00:55] <HeadsHeldHigh> Here we go boiz
[1:00:57] <ItsZelus> @sunriser101 Don't give me hope :(
[1:00:58] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt It's hilarious how hard Cloud tries to be cool but he just comes off as a massive edgy dork
[1:01:01] <RichochetForce> @miakhalifaisoverrated Go ahead, it's fun.
[1:01:03] <%Guardiansaiyan> @YakumoYomi hopefully they weren't all complaining about swinging swords

[1:13:07] <corpsegoo> I have fucking magical hopes for Cid in this
[1:13:08] <+rottingpastry> I always had to remind myself the block button exists

[1:13:28] <%GalacticLatte> Damage numbers make my damage number go up
[1:13:29] <iggeh> why would you not wanna see numbers
[1:13:29] <WarchiefGoldva> Numbers are good. They tell you if you're doing well.
[1:13:31] <RichochetForce> It clearly means run right into the laser.
[1:13:31] <%Taisuru> AOE
[1:13:33] <robo_badger> Remember, attack when the tail is up
[1:13:35] <SomeOtherNeb> you should attack it now!

[1:14:38] <otakon17> or start blocking
[1:14:38] <Shishi1205> You can press R2 to command Barret faster @PatStaresAt
[1:14:39] <%Dragon_Batman> Not using an ether huh?
[1:14:40] <RichochetForce> I'm absolutely loving the per-object motion blur. Seeing the Guard Scorpion's guns fire and seeing its blurry action is cool as hell
[1:14:49] <@Fuggins4U> thank you for continuing to be good to Pat and Paige! <3
[1:14:54] <+rottingpastry> he might need those ethers for the final boss
[1:14:55] <%Guardiansaiyan> Barrett is FUCKING UP

[1:15:12] <WarchiefGoldva> BIG LIMIT
[1:15:13] <%CrypticMochi> Block seems like the better reflex button than dodge

[1:15:19] <muniea3> ETHER
[1:15:25] <Shishi1205> I actually got to see BArrets limit in the beta
[1:15:27] <otakon17> yeah Dodge has no invincibility frames
[1:15:28] <%taku_toots> right to the face
[1:15:46] <Edible_Enthusiasm> is there something up with the audio
[1:15:51] <%Razputin217> Tank the laser
[1:15:52] <%Taisuru> Not yet at least
[1:15:59] <%sund0wner> WHOOP
[1:16:01] <otakon17> HIT HIM WITH EVERYTHING YOU GOT!
[1:16:08] <%joylent_blue> Edible_Enthusiasm might be a twitch bug, try refresh
[1:16:08] <HeadsHeldHigh> Staggered makes them take more damage from specials, right?
[1:16:09] <%GarbageNirvana> @edible_enthusiasm Not on my end
[1:16:19] <+amiroodude> Man limit break builds sloooww
[1:16:21] <Shishi1205> More dmg in general
[1:16:24] <%sund0wner> SHMACK IT
[1:16:26] <RichochetForce> Man, certain bosses are going to be cool as shit in this engine. Imagine Materia Keeper or the Gold Saucer exclusive monsters.
[1:16:32] <OToole42> that shock has a janky hurt box
[1:16:33] <otakon17> Staggered works like it did in 13, so you do bonus damage
[1:16:36] <otakon17> Go for the legs!
[1:16:37] <+Reaverund> So is the story stuff objectively bad, or just people being babies?
[1:16:39] <Theonlypegsus> Twist his diiiick
[1:16:39] <%Dragon_Batman> @Edible_Enthusiasm Twitch is probably trying to catch up refresh or pause and start again
[1:16:41] <jyeowa> BARRET WHAT? I CANT HEAR YOU OVER THE SOUND OF BATTLE
[1:16:45] <%sund0wner> People being babies
[1:16:48] <Wafflez1909> @Edible_Enthusiasm twitch speeding up to catch up fucks the music a little bit, is that what you're getting
[1:16:50] <+thackattack00> its bad
[1:16:50] <%thegreenbenis> Magic, pat
[1:16:54] <otakon17> Don't forget Lightning!
[1:16:57] <%thegreenbenis> Oh...
[1:17:01] <RichochetForce> It's Kingdom Hearts 3 level nonsense.
[1:17:02] <%troxvon_the_lesser> TWIST THE DICK
[1:17:05] <Shishi1205> Use abilities you have full atb
[1:17:05] <%majindusto> People are being Babies, yes
[1:17:08] <RichochetForce> Whether it's bad depends on you.
[1:17:12] <HeadsHeldHigh> @RichochetForce Bruuuuh chill
[1:17:12] <+FrostMass22> Honestly, the people defending it are just trying to cope
[1:17:16] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> @Edible_Enthusiasm If Twitch is trying to catch up on your end, it'll speed the video up a little bit which is noticeable on the music's pitch
[1:17:17] <%happyface699> The ol dick twist
[1:17:18] <IntrepidEye> some of it isn't great but a lot of it is people just being babies
[1:17:18] <Ianrazz> @thegreenbenis No sackbeating pls d69Yoda
[1:17:24] <%solzan2000> cloud getting bodied
[1:17:24] <RichochetForce> @IntrepidEye Exactly
[1:17:26] <corpsegoo> There's one thing I 100% understand people being upset about, but at the same time it's just not worth the effort
[1:17:31] <cureneckbeard> You're visually incredible
[1:17:31] <+FrostMass22> Yeah, well, wait on part 2
[1:17:33] <laguerrilha> You can see the attack its going t do by the red text over the name
[1:17:34] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> psaUp
[1:17:34] <Ipsenscastle> Why is Pat trying to do this without using any moves
[1:17:38] <mostundesired> no iframes DansGame
[1:17:39] <otakon17> yeah even Dark Souls gave you frames
[1:17:40] <%SoFarFetched> YOUUUU
[1:17:41] <%suikudo> Put your shield up wo... wait
[1:17:41] <Chester_goes_Berserk> I think peeps are going to be split right down the middle on the story
[1:17:43] <%sund0wner> SOULJA BOI?!
[1:17:43] <Nupinoop296> what's the point of a dodge with no invincibility
[1:17:43] <%GalacticLatte> SOLDIER BOY TELL EM
[1:17:45] <TomFrank> kingdom hearts combat really works in this setting, the video game remake era is killing it
[1:17:46] <%Ultimatefool> TELL EM
[1:17:47] <otakon17> he's not used to the combat system yet
[1:17:48] <Edible_Enthusiasm> @Valentinius_Anodyne just seems crackley when it gets loud.
[1:17:48] <%asgard147> limesYay
[1:17:49] <%Dragon_Batman> Yea it seemed like the dodge is more for a quick distance setter

[1:18:11] <mostundesired> Then it's not a dodge, is it?
[1:18:13] <+rottingpastry> you can dodge em field if you do it the second you see em field pop up above the boss
[1:18:13] <otakon17> you get a Materia that gives Dodge an auto attack later on

[1:18:22] <Shishi1205> Dodge is to get out of assault mode @PatStaresAt Basically LUL
[1:18:24] <julrave> why would you give the bomb a voice timer/???
[1:18:24] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> @Edible_Enthusiasm Ah, not sure what would be causing it then
[1:18:25] <Wafflez1909> dodge is for unblockable shit and positioning

[1:21:09] <Shishi1205> the materia on the sword looks sick
[1:21:09] <$shadow1man9> If I remember correctly you do different combos if you mash attack as opposed to holding it. I think for Punisher mashing gives you a stab that gives a buff
[1:21:10] <%PanicSwytch> LUL
[1:21:10] <abuse_of_juice> D:
[1:21:11] <%Movemeister> Getting up in there LUL

[1:23:37] <Shishi1205> Did he miss that one down there too?
[1:23:46] <otakon17> I love that you don't have to pick up items physically
[1:23:47] <WackyModder84> So how far in the story does "Episode 1" cover before they cut it off?
[1:23:48] <WarchiefGoldva> The Stagger system from 13 is the only good thing it ever did. Building strategy for huge blowouts like that is 100% amazing.
[1:23:51] <$Mothman742> @Indeimaus love ur latest vid btw <3
[1:23:51] <+SaltyGhostRock> They are noisier than DD's pawns

[1:24:06] <otakon17> AGREED, STagger was the only good thing
[1:24:09] <otakon17> THESE GUYS
[1:24:11] <%GalacticLatte> The fact that Cloud's sword never dulls is amazing
[1:24:11] <Wafflez1909> @WackyModder84 all of midgar, so pretty much disk 1
[1:24:12] <%j0ustar> well that and its music
[1:24:12] <otakon17> dodge EVERYTHING!
[1:24:14] <+Dayube> music was good tho
[1:24:14] <%StaceMcGate> the music in 13 was good
[1:24:15] <%joylent_blue> WackyModder84 ends as you leave midgar as far as i know
[1:24:16] <TioXyco> @WackyModder84 the bombing mission
[1:24:18] <%Stratiotai2> Stratiotai2 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 12 months! 
[1:24:18] <TheFranss> Welp. Guess we gotta mplay 13 now
[1:24:21] <%Dragon_Batman> Eh 13 was passable
[1:24:21] <otakon17> Use BLock and Punisher Mode!
[1:24:23] <Shishi1205> Yeyeye
[1:24:25] <%Yummy_Nukes> it's like he's some sort of ex-soldier or something
[1:24:26] <%dukenux> PogChamp

[1:24:29] <%CursedNobleman> i like the design of these guys, but they dont really make sense LUL
[1:24:33] <NiktenKing> Music and art design was good.... gameplay was snorefest
[1:24:33] <%BoomerUnchained> psaWhat
[1:24:33] <%solzan2000> FF13 music was amazing, FF13 series was ok
[1:24:38] <Shishi1205> there you go
[1:24:40] <CapCasual> Actual pieces of shit are crying upon being insulted like that.
[1:24:41] <%Ultimatefool> SLOPPEH
[1:24:41] <Indeimaus> so happy they just redesigned all the old ff7 enemies
[1:24:43] <Hepathos87> FF13 is good after the first 47 hours of gameplay
[1:24:43] <RichochetForce> @CursedNobleman Turn brain off, enjoy goofy FFVII enemies
[1:24:43] <SomeOtherNeb> EUUUGH
[1:24:43] <otakon17> God this music is amazing
[1:24:45] <WarchiefGoldva> BOOM
[1:24:46] <%NovaKnightmare> Are those human??
[1:24:47] <+CelioHogane> @Hellarussian "I heard you like Persona 5 Royale"
[1:24:51] <otakon17> they were humans
[1:24:55] <+CelioHogane> @NovaKnightmare yes, it's just a suit
[1:24:55] <Shishi1205> Hey @Indeimaus
[1:24:57] <RichochetForce> @CursedNobleman Remember the ghost rider biker enemies just outside Midgar.
[1:24:59] <%CursedNobleman> @RichochetForce LESS TALK. MORE HELLHOUSE LUL
[1:25:04] <Shishi1205> How is it going
[1:25:06] <+LordSDB> Okay 13 did have some sick ass music
[1:25:07] <RichochetForce> @CursedNobleman Yes!
[1:25:08] <$RealThiele> the earth cries out for you to wreck shit
[1:25:12] <+LandOfTheWay> 13-2 gave us a good 3D model of Omega, so there's that
[1:25:17] <otakon17> WALLOP!
[1:25:25] <snekUrgentPls> LUL this room
[1:25:27] <WarchiefGoldva> 50% of his stagger meter goes up on a single counter!
[1:25:27] <+CelioHogane> @LandOfTheWay and of certain octopus
[1:25:31] <Shishi1205> They are about hte same
[1:25:31] <Wafflez1909> Ultros and Typhon, too
[1:25:36] <%solzan2000> FF13 series was ok, peeps hate on it wayyy too much
[1:25:38] <+amiroodude> Shock troopers mean buisness
[1:25:45] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt It makes no sense that those ninja dudes can dodge gunfire from a goddamn Gatling Gun but are totally unable to dodge a sword swing
[1:25:48] <calboku> they're weak against fire dude
[1:25:50] <theloniousgunk> the shock troopers look like puttys from power rangers
[1:25:55] <%GalacticLatte> How are these people even going to hit the weapons? I just thought of that LOL
[1:25:56] <%StaceMcGate> 13 was average at best and got two unnecessary sequels
[1:25:56] <+CelioHogane> @solzan2000 i disagree, it failed at everything it shouldn't fail as a Final Fantasy
[1:25:59] <Indeimaus> screamlord you work at cinemasins or what
[1:26:01] <%GalacticLatte> They're gonna be hitting their toes
[1:26:07] <RichochetForce> @theloniousgunk That's what I thought they were as a kid.
[1:26:07] <%solzan2000> your opinion
[1:26:08] <+LordSpectreX> except they are dodging the sword swings.
[1:26:11] <Shishi1205> LUL cinemasins
[1:26:12] <Ianrazz> @ScreamLord Who cares ???
[1:26:15] <%CavemanInCave> SUCK IT
[1:26:22] <otakon17> They'll dodge until hit with a Punisher Block Cunter
[1:26:26] <Shishi1205> Use cure
[1:26:26] <+amiroodude> ALMOST TO NEW STUFF
[1:26:29] <MilletDumplings> 13-3 was bad
[1:26:29] <ScreamLord> @Indeimaus No but I'd probably do good in it
[1:26:29] <otakon17> oh shit that was a typo I meant COUNTER
[1:26:30] <Shishi1205> More efficient
[1:26:31] <$hzealot> still not using at for heals
[1:26:32] <$shadow1man9> @PatStaresAt Mashing attack as opposed to holding it does give you a different combo if I remember correctly

[1:47:16] <KawaiiJetty> Rip kid
[1:47:17] <%troxvon_the_lesser> How big of a murder before it turns from terrorist attack to like a war crime/genocide
[1:47:18] <laguerrilha> give the kid some change
[1:47:19] <Elsewize> That makes it even more sympathetic, I think.
[1:47:20] <%dukenux> Yeah, but they're STILL OK WITH IT

[1:47:27] <%suikudo> Barret is gonna be pissed when he finds out shinra did this and not him
[1:47:27] <mothdude> Elmo give the glasses back
[1:47:28] <%SoFarFetched> What if glasses are in her bed
[1:47:29] <clintonificent> oh i like that they still do fixed camera in some spots

[1:47:31] <MrMysteryMask> psaBlind psaBlind
[1:47:32] <%MasterTonberry23> I mean the first game barely touched on that at all and was borderline "terrorism is great! all the cool kids are doing it!"
[1:47:33] <LozsCat> Are you sure about that
[1:47:35] <otakon17> Elmo knows where the glasses are
[1:47:36] <%asgard147> "FATHER! I DEMAND VIOLENCE!" psaPorgmo
[1:47:36] <%optimasmaximas> psaBlep
[1:47:38] <%BoomerUnchained> Maybe they should'nt have shown that Shinra was behind it immediately
[1:47:39] <%Guardiansaiyan> @jaygee303 its a good movie for the ending of the original VII
[1:47:39] <%optimasmaximas> psaBlind
[1:47:42] <Torgue_1> Elmo, WHERE ARE THE GLASSES?
[1:47:42] <%SummonerMagno> when Elmo Screams at
[1:47:42] <BioApple> can't wait to fight nemesis on this rooftop
[1:47:45] <clintonificent> reminds me of Nier Automaters with the dynamic camera
[1:47:46] <%Valdorick> Geostigma.
[1:47:46] <%Ultimatefool> It's crazy, parts of this game LOOK like pre-rendered
[1:47:46] <%UvBenServed> That's one way to put it
[1:47:47] <%dukenux> WHAT A SHAME

[1:48:05] <Flarepulse> Beaufort, the next 2fort
[1:48:06] <%troxvon_the_lesser> Honestly if they didn't show that shinra did this then I would be routing for avalanche to die
[1:48:07] <OToole42> If cloud was still employed as a member of soldier, it would be a warcrime, as part of a grassroots eco-terrorist group it's still domestic terrorism
[1:48:07] <+SaltyGhostRock> Advent Children is terrible
[1:48:08] <hat_under_bread> OH sweet, a chest!
[1:48:09] <%valriot> MONEY
[1:48:11] <jorniev> LOOK AT THAT HSIT ON FIRE
[1:48:12] <illTemperedSeaBass> @troxvon_the_lesser Pretty sure it needs to be an action from a foreign state to be a war crime. Crimes against humanity, perhaps.
[1:48:12] <+yoshkosh20> look at all these homeless kids
[1:48:14] <%GalacticLatte> Imagine it on PC with 4K textures
[1:48:17] <Mayachacha> tehy better be practicing social distancing
[1:48:19] <%sund0wner> Didn't ask a question got an answer
[1:48:20] <de1ete_forever> cloud is such a huge dork, omg
[1:48:21] <%sund0wner> Aiiiiight
[1:48:21] <Indeimaus> advent children full cut is not terrible
[1:48:22] <%rytyoung> Fixed CAMERA ANGLES
[1:48:22] <%stemlo_> They shouldn't have been so quick to show the player their innocence, it neuters the poignancy in a way
[1:48:24] <WackyModder84> @SaltyGhostRock, Advent Children's canon status is honestly in question at this point. lol
[1:48:24] <%solzan2000> PV version gonna look lush
[1:48:25] <jorniev> REACTOR LOOKS A LOT ON FIRE
[1:48:26] <clintonificent> i'm gonna watch today's stream then play the rest of the game for myself so make it good, Patrick Strife
[1:48:28] <hassanico2> If you rub it to that family the woman wants to take the kids and leave the guy
[1:48:28] <hyphenated_q> Gotta add some looting into the destruction
[1:48:28] <%solzan2000> PC*
[1:48:31] <KawaiiJetty> He sounded very calm
[1:48:32] <%Madbearv> paige broken
[1:48:33] <DesertPenguin> Fuck, people say this is 30-50 hours and Pat's not gonna rush through. Oh boy this is gonna be good
[1:48:34] <%Sirsquizz> sitting is hard
[1:48:34] <hassanico2> Then the kids start talking about wanting to go back for their toys

[1:48:50] <+SaltySombrero> hey talk to that guy with the hat
[1:48:50] <%optimasmaximas> paige is velma
[1:48:52] <%SGrim> @troxvon_the_lesser terrorism is a form of war crime, and genocide has to have a government sponsor and specific ethnic or religious target. SO technically, you could kill an extreme amount of random people, like this, and it's still an act of terrorism.
[1:48:52] <%doc_ock_rokc> What if Paige is the only Player controled person alive and we are all NPCs
[1:48:53] <clintonificent> this is the Crisis Core street!

[1:56:41] <@StridentSong> It's already on Follower mode
[1:56:41] <bakkatohri> Can you really spoil this if all you played was the original game? Like it seems as if there's branching paths in this game with the multiple choices. Y'know, unless it's like Persona and they don't matter.
[1:56:42] <CHVMPLOO> gameplay looks great
[1:56:42] <RichochetForce> @BlueMoonBlues Digital Foundry said it's 30fps
[1:56:42] <%MakotoPB> this sound track is nostalgic but upgraded nostalgia
[1:56:43] <$Dakuu75> So, I can see Materia changed on the on the sword. Does any other gear change on the model?

[1:56:53] <%realm_forge> The Patented Pat Butt Stomp Ban
[1:56:54] <corpsegoo> no matter what happened in the original, there are ways to spoil the remake and people need to be mindful of that shit
[1:56:55] <Indeimaus> the combat is honestly so good to play
[1:56:55] <%StaceMcGate> Talking about original game is fine, don't talk about new elements of the remake
[1:56:55] <hassanico2> @bakkatohri just so you know, the answer is yes

[1:57:06] <godila2> @bakkatohri there is new big stuff which are huge spoilers
[1:57:09] <mostundesired> @Hommando The fact that you can control other characters is already a major plus, and then they give you a lot more options compared to XV

[2:06:18] <mostundesired> How the hell do you know that, Pat?

[2:06:20] <+b9k9com> I've never had a butterfinger :p
[2:06:20] <bestwaifuritsu> butterfingers are concentrated chocolate shrapnel designed to ruin the roof of your mouth
[2:06:20] <clintonificent> dick feel coat
[2:06:20] <Theonlypegsus> I DON'T LIKE THAT
[2:06:20] <+chattychocobo> i want every candybard i eat to have the mouthfeel of dicks
[2:06:20] <%PettyFunk> Is your dick crumbly and flaky???
[2:06:21] <+thatotherblackkid> Butterfingers are D Tier Candy Bars
[2:06:21] <%Sirsquizz> its shitty peanut brittle
[2:06:21] <%rumtumtugnutz> Why would dicks be flaky and unpleasant?
[2:06:22] <%Valdorick> Butterfingers use to be good, but the new recipe sucks.
[2:06:23] <cheesedburgers> pat what dixks have you been chewing on
[2:06:24] <xxshadowxx416> butterfingers are not top tier but they are middle teir
[2:06:24] <SomeOtherNeb> does Stamp stand up FOR THE PLANET?
[2:06:25] <%j0ustar> Butterfinger is baddddd
[2:06:25] <Gregorhasjoined> psaBig STAMP
[2:06:26] <%CrypticMochi> I hate how it sticks to my teeth
[2:06:26] <GarbageQueenEllie> If your dick feels like a butterfinger, SEE A DOCTOR
[2:06:26] <$Dakuu75> Is that why Barret calls you "stamp" in the demo? it's that dog-movie-poster?
[2:06:27] <sjcodan> REMEMBER THAT STAMP, ITS UNIRONICALLY IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT DOG
[2:06:27] <+TheFabledAble> what about a snickers? big and round and you can slide 5 inches in your mouth at once, has a penutty taste and gooey caramel
[2:06:28] <toyforus235> made out of PB
[2:06:29] <heartlesshealer> dicks taste better than Butterfingers. And I would know
[2:06:30] <reinbachthe3rd> It's got, like, peanut butter brittle that gets all up in your molars.
[2:06:30] <Jrocy247> I hate ButterFingers or ANY chocolate bar that has Nuts in it
[2:06:31] <%MasterTonberry23> "We just wanted to question this guy and he started murdering everybody!"
[2:06:31] <%maenos2> Love butterfingers but they adhere to my teeth something fierce
[2:06:32] <%floralkami> Butterfingers suck
[2:06:32] <gekizenbu> when's Stamp going to snitch his friends out for the company
[2:06:33] <xanderfist> Damnet I really wanna butterfingers now
[2:06:33] <+Kurogane_Dread> Does Cloud have sick air combos yet
[2:06:35] <b_fran> We love our butterdick candy
[2:06:35] <%GarbageNirvana> If I want a crunchy peanut butter thing I go for the PB Twix now
[2:06:36] <BoneofMalkav> So what Pat is saying is "No body better lay a finger on my DICK!" LUL
[2:06:38] <NiktenKing> OOF
[2:06:39] <BioApple> pat if your dick flakes off and gets stuck in paige's teeth you should see a doctor

[2:06:52] <YakumoYomi> "Coats your teeth with dick feel"? I guess that's why I don't like Butterfingers.
[2:06:55] <hassanico2> @PlainSimpleTailor Good news you can get the DLC from Baby Ruths too!

[2:16:03] <RichochetForce> @Wafflez1909 He slays the Biocurse
[2:16:07] <+RayDaug> You think anyone who's called someone "Dead meat" has called someone "alive meat?"
[2:16:09] <SomeOtherNeb> @Hommando I know! I want to see the cutscene so I can go pee AFTER
[2:16:15] <%joylent_blue> iaraCatunda he hasnt even made it back to 7th heaven yet

[2:16:20] <lionsignal> the potion has that weird green bubble effect that the original had coool
[2:16:21] <%MonsterEnvy> Using magic seems to stun them
[2:16:21] <%Dementedpenguin> @Valentinius_Anodyne imagine the people looking out their homes right now

[2:16:40] <+Remery_> fuck your parry
[2:16:41] <GarbageQueenEllie> I'd feel inclined to tell Sephiroth that I feel like the biggest hero out of spite. Like even if the world imploded, I'd be like "Yeah, bitch, I'm the HERO!"
[2:16:41] <SomeOtherNeb> @Hommando my bladder is its own biocurse
[2:16:44] <$iaraCatunda> @joylent_blue @dakuu75 I'm getting ahead of myself looool

[2:16:45] <+CelioHogane> Ouchy ouch
[2:16:51] <bakkatohri> What is "dead" meat anyway? Like, meat's already dead... seems kinda redundant to me.

[2:16:55] <%Movemeister> He has grown large and poweful

[2:16:57] <%MasterTonberry23> You murdered a lot of people so they had to bring out the big guns
[2:17:00] <NiktenKing> He has a red shield... so probably resists fire?
[2:17:01] <+Dio_Goodguy> drop your shield man

[3:20:24] <zeif00> Hamauzu worked on a lot of the tracks in this game
[3:20:26] <RichochetForce> I bet this and its sequels are basically FF16-19
[3:20:29] <%taku_toots> Hahaha
[3:20:30] <+tuchpi> and people are still complaining LUL
[3:20:31] <%Andrizzleton> XV could have been so good...but
[3:20:32] <%j0ustar> oof
[3:20:38] <brad0war> wait, when did ff15 come out?
[3:20:39] <xxmagonx> LUL
[3:20:39] <+michingmallecho> Pat you said it like a year ago. This is final fantasy 16
[3:20:39] <%Taisuru> Aww XII is decent
[3:20:40] <Nupinoop296> FF12 was good
[3:20:41] <%VritraReiRei> "only"
[3:20:41] <%StaceMcGate> not high standards
[3:20:41] <dan_g_v> oof
[3:20:41] <FlamingoJazz> @jyeowa should've just kept the camera zoomed out during dialogue
[3:20:42] <devil_may_cum_> @zeif00 Good he’s fantastic
[3:20:43] <fluffy_sauce> 14 isn't single player
[3:20:43] <%happyface699> Pats happy
[3:20:43] <WackyModder84> @Andrizzleton, It's still pretty good. But it's unfinished. That's the problem.
[3:20:43] <+Remery_> But FFXV with the boys
[3:20:45] <%StaceMcGate> 2015 for FF15
[3:20:46] <%keyworthe> FF15 sucks dick
[3:20:48] <boomstickery> thats a hell of a tail off
[3:20:48] <%j0ustar> 12 was a mess
[3:20:48] <Timurine> "only"
[3:20:51] <%Dragon_Batman> 15 is still pretty decent
[3:20:51] <%optimasmaximas> @brad0war like 2016/2017
[3:20:51] <%Tucker0603> 14 rules
[3:20:52] <%TheSphereHunter> But like... Woff was great!
[3:20:53] <%doc_ock_rokc> 12 was good but bland
[3:20:55] <$Hommando> FFXV wasn't that bad, fight me
[3:20:57] <+schlager087> man if they had made tifa playable in the demo I probably would have gotten this instead of re3
[3:21:00] <GarbageQueenEllie> And also this game doesn't have Vaughn
[3:21:03] <%optimasmaximas> LUL
[3:21:03] <mrjplays2k9> 12 was star wars
[3:21:04] <%doc_ock_rokc> LIke I played it and I forgot most of it
[3:21:04] <+Remery_> FFXV had fishing tho
[3:21:06] <%gespenst25> So far final fantasy XIV 5 is the best final fantasy game <_<
[3:21:07] <laguerrilha> XV wasnt bad

[3:26:33] <iambqb> @jorniev Fair point, but have you considered: TRIPLE TRIAD
[3:26:34] <corpsegoo> it's got a nifty ability so it's not necessarily a bad thing to equip it long enough to learn the skill then ditch it
[3:26:37] <%indig0bird> Punisher!
[3:26:41] <%Fenrirlives> @patstaresat all Weapons are equally balanced with different specialties!
[3:26:43] <Finaldragoon> oh hey it's the Crystarium from 13
[3:26:44] <arcanemacrocosm> it will allow you to get a new skill if i read that right
[3:26:46] <%TalisKanju> Oh god, is this the Sphere Grid all over again? AUGH!!
[3:26:48] <bigstupidjellyfish1337> The Busta Sword

[3:28:10] <%RyanTheRecluse> @patstaresat remember to manual save consistently, the autosave is kind of unreliable.

[3:28:30] <clintonificent> look at this Civilopedia shit
[3:28:30] <%Tucker0603> i think just lvling up
[3:28:35] <%RyanTheRecluse> just leveling up gives sp for all weapons
[3:28:37] <+LordSpectreX> SP goes up for every weapon you have, even if they're unequipped
[3:28:37] <zecht89> nooo they have special requirements
[3:28:41] <bestwaifuritsu> SP is gained after each battle, not just leveling up
[3:28:41] <heartlesshealer> ...
[3:28:46] <+michingmallecho> kupo
[3:28:47] <graemecrackers2> tifa is a fit bird
[3:28:48] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Good
[3:28:49] <GarbageQueenEllie> You have to equip your Persona to level it up
[3:28:52] <reinbachthe3rd> Rotate the saves.
[3:28:52] <laguerrilha> oh good

[3:29:08] <JaerHQ> shrimp5Bean
[3:29:13] <Deekman> what if ya mum ran on batrries?
[3:29:14] <robo_badger> Sp is basically weapon exp then?

[3:29:16] <goontaker> No thats AP
[3:29:17] <%asgard147> When FF7 unlocked
[3:29:17] <brad0war> THERE ARE ONLY 10 SAVE SLOTS
[3:29:28] <clintonificent> good game! issa good Final Fantasy game! doesn't it feel GREAT
[3:29:31] <OToole42> Tifa is tankier than cloud
[3:29:31] <GarbageQueenEllie> 10 is more than enough for good rotation
[3:29:33] <mortificent> psaUp psaUp psaUp
[3:29:41] <%RyanTheRecluse> AP is gained after every battle, SP is only for levels.

[4:05:16] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt Thats how games in big studios WORK
[4:05:16] <%narusao> we call those guy interns

[4:05:17] <gekizenbu> PUSSY SLAYER
[4:05:18] <heartlesshealer> Yeah
[4:05:19] <%RyanTheRecluse> Textures are not great for like 30% of the models
[4:05:19] <mrjplays2k9> @PatStaresAt THERES SUPPOSED TO BE A DAY 1 PATCH TO FIX THE TEXTURES
[4:05:19] <+Chronobot> 100gbs of unique textures
[4:05:21] <Ipsenscastle> Like every Final Fantasy?
[4:05:21] <graemecrackers2> Omg they were roommates
[4:05:22] <%bigboy3d> they often outsource asset creation

[4:05:26] <Angry_Ev1L> LAZY DEVS
[4:05:26] <bestwaifuritsu> @PatStaresAt Im sorry to tell you this but texture problems are very apparent and plentiful throughout the entire game.
[4:05:26] <%SABiscotti> Paige is right
[4:05:26] <%j0ustar> probably a limitation tho
[4:05:28] <%floralkami> ITS ALREADY 100 GIGS
[4:05:29] <%keyworthe> well its fucking ps4 what do you expect
[4:05:30] <Monkeyweed21> Cloud is 50% of the texture work
[4:05:31] <+forgetme000> game no like you running
[4:05:33] <ChiefSombrero> 1 tb of textures

[4:05:42] <%mostundesired> All the texture work went into Tifa's tiddies.
[4:05:42] <+Wight_Trash> this shit is over 100 gigs? FUCK
[4:05:43] <Tha_Mik> It's been 5 years pat
[4:05:44] <darkdagon769> nah its pretty bad even on dialogue
[4:05:46] <%wsintai> Thats a good thing for a day 1 patch honestly
[4:05:48] <muniea3> oh like a 100gb patch
[4:05:48] <RichochetForce> Yeah, I imagine there might be a texture streaming issue. I know Monster Hunter on PS4/XB1 has abysmal texture quality.
[4:05:51] <%UvBenServed> We need more textures on Tifa's ABS
[4:05:51] <Ipsenscastle> NPCs in X were the ugliest
[4:05:52] <%kraajkase> my copy unlock in 3 minutes
[4:05:52] <%RyanTheRecluse> The 100gigs is probably just uncompressed audio
[4:05:56] <Angry_Ev1L> @mrjplays2k9 u sure about that?
[4:05:59] <ScreamLord> 50GB Patch for textures alone
[4:06:02] <de1ete_forever> psaJpeg psaJpeg_SQ psaJpeg_SQ
[4:06:02] <%keyworthe> this is running on hardware from 2013

[4:06:13] <Flarepulse> you fucking cut in line
[4:06:14] <+LordSDB> Well with all the data they got from FF15, from lighting, wind, and textures, they may not have had to do too much work.
[4:06:15] <MrHydecrow> outch this radio post
[4:06:15] <darkdagon769> they do seem pretty expressionless when doing generic dialogue like for quests
[4:06:17] <%asgard147> limesMusic quiettMusic
[4:06:19] <jorniev> SONG
[4:06:29] <RichochetForce> @RyanTheRecluse Yeah, a lot of data on disc is uncompressed audio and redundant data for faster loading on HDDs.
[4:06:29] <%Nope80808> BLOOOZZZ
[4:06:29] <%Guardiansaiyan> @PatStaresAt different one
[4:06:32] <Shwepie> @PatStaresAt Kind of. This is pretty normal for SE when it comes to FF. The further you get from the face the greater the effort/quality drop.

[4:07:44] <%THATGUY_789> what game is that guy from
[4:07:47] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Some kind soul warned me about what happens halfway through Bravely Default and I'm so relieved I never touched it.
[4:07:55] <%IntrepidEye> Hopefully the PC version will come out next years once the one year timed exclusivity deal runs out
[4:08:00] <SomeOtherNeb> what is this Nier Automata location
[4:08:02] <%CursedNobleman> @PlainSimpleTailor TIME PARADOX
[4:08:04] <Jrocy247> i JUST like how every Male character so far is like, "OH....TIFA....SURE YOU CAN DO WHATEVER YOU WANT. HEHE"
[4:08:06] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> psaGoblin
[4:08:07] <RichochetForce> @PlainSimpleTailor That pissed me off so bad. One of the nastiest twists in gaming.

[4:08:08] <%MrBorisMakarov> god you're right @SomeOtherNeb
[4:08:08] <+Wight_Trash> The civilians are wearing reasonable clothes, did Nomura get kicked out of the office for this part?
[4:08:12] <$Hommando> @PlainSimpleTailor That was the worst shit
[4:08:13] <%XeroSigmaPrime> I like how even tho they have GUN, They are in AWE over Tifa's fisticuffs. Shit must be legendary

[4:18:45] <bestwaifuritsu> If potions are actually energy drinks NAMED potion and they only cost 100 gil that means Cloud was willing to commit terrorism for not even a 24 pack of soda. Damn.

[4:55:33] <%UvBenServed> LUL
[4:55:34] <theloniousgunk> too much positivity in Max's stream. I prefer hanging with the goblin-folk
[4:55:38] <%optimasmaximas> LUL
[4:55:43] <framewindowcleaner> @RyanTheRecluse Farm for a gift sub, they're an insane number of chances
[4:55:49] <Malisin_Murder> LUL

[4:56:01] <%dukenux> Nomuraaaaaa
[4:56:02] <hcsarg1986> Why would Max stream at the same time as Pat? That seems inconsiderate.
[4:56:04] <%valriot> CLOUD CALM DOWN

[4:56:27] <%SaphronBlackbourne> Eh I mean Pat and Woolie stream at the same time a lot
[4:56:27] <%sexdrugsvideogames> shoryuken
[4:56:29] <%StaceMcGate> Max can stream FF whenever he wants after the amount of shilling and hype build the man has done. He deserves it

[4:56:40] <%king_wragles> Hey, if you can just fly why even bother having guns for far away enemies?
[4:56:40] <%dukenux> AFAIK Max is a huge FFVII mark, so he's gonna stream the first moment he has a chance?
[4:56:41] <SomersaultJustice> FF vs Capcom

[4:58:39] <+OneGorillionDollars> Lesson 1: HOW TO SIMP
[4:58:41] <%Typhaeon> So many spheres to hunt
[4:58:42] <vinceshamwowslap> why the music keep doing that
[4:58:43] <thesaverofhumens> Can't wait till PC mods remove the black stuff from tifas top
[4:58:45] <+SaltyGhostRock> Am I Johnny?
[4:58:46] <%StaceMcGate> Max already has 5.3k viewers
[4:58:47] <+river_city98> metal gear?!
[4:58:48] <framewindowcleaner> FFXIII BULLSHIT
[4:58:49] <+Monkeydude07> Johnny's getting slapped
[4:58:49] <televisedrevolting> Johnny has left to find the One Piece.
[4:58:49] <+Ryandesu> Aerith has a lovely voice in this game, enjoy meeting her
[4:58:50] <%ShichiNoBushi> That guy that always poops himself in MGS?
[4:58:50] <+demon_shadowplays> Why does tifa have clown shoes on?
[4:58:51] <%코코꾸라> R2
[4:58:54] <greendragon111> good Tifa Cloud moments, I still ship him with arith though
[4:58:56] <+Atomic_ColliderSG> did you have to do all those side quests to move the plot/
[4:58:57] <%TalisKanju> This is some Sphere Grid stuff right there
[4:58:58] <Ghostduck01> oh god they put a sphere system in

[4:59:04] <SomeOtherNeb> chat, we're ALL Johnny
[4:59:06] <%PanicSwytch> @patstaresat Seeing Tifa's combat, Do u think a Ehrgeiz sequel could happen?
[4:59:07] <bestwaifuritsu> @PatStaresAt you dont need to complete one to use the other, pick what you want where you want
[4:59:10] <+Parlux> Im starting to think Tifa and cloud are just fuck buddies just clixmaxing when the rest
[4:59:10] <%LouieRouie> "Who's Johnny?", she said
[4:59:12] <%furiousfurioso> ???
[4:59:13] <%keyworthe> cant wait for the hot coffee mod for this game
[4:59:14] <%TenderBabyBacon> finish one before starting the new.
[4:59:15] <Sanyle> Why does square bother lipsyncing outside of cutscenes? 15 had this problem as well
[4:59:17] <Shishi1205> you need to unlock it?
[4:59:20] <%RyanTheRecluse> @patstaresat Hate to do this to you but there's an npc near the weapon shop that has been counting how many monsters you kill for rewards
[4:59:21] <graemecrackers2> Cloud loves his butterfinger
[4:59:22] <kd0g_> Let the mind goblins commence
[4:59:29] <+Ryandesu> Tifa is my favourite character to play as
[4:59:29] <Ghostduck01> they really cant help themselves can they?
[4:59:31] <%TenderBabyBacon> Must appease the gobolins
[4:59:34] <thesaverofhumens> lip sync is probably automatic
[4:59:34] <%Yummy_Nukes> @patstaresat would it be worth it to upgrade the buster sword too?
[4:59:35] <%cvp5127> you can respec
[4:59:35] <%TheMattman1313> I would say finish the first core
[4:59:39] <+SaltyGhostRock> The real Johnny was the friends we left along the way :)

[5:00:10] <+keatiestofthegribbles> cant wait 4 pc release for all the nude mods
[5:00:12] <%Dragon_Batman> I think at the very least maybe finish off a core
[5:00:16] <NiktenKing> Finish a core to keep stats and unique abilities
[5:00:19] <%Bonkasaurusrex> Use the ability
[5:00:19] <+loukemia83> Profiecency
[5:00:19] <%RyanTheRecluse> weapons stay relevant the entire game
[5:00:20] <+dmtjinni> ?/10
[5:00:20] <%AllenDeadman> maxout the weapon skill to use it whenever, like in IX
[5:00:22] <$lotharrio> Master
[5:00:22] <Finaldragoon> max proficiency
[5:00:23] <%TenderBabyBacon> Proficiency
[5:00:26] <+Ryandesu> By getting it to 100%
[5:00:26] <%Tucker0603> max out profeciency
[5:00:28] <WarchiefGoldva> Proficiency, it's not based on SP.
[5:00:33] <Arek_1> What's with the sudden push for Johnny? In the OG FFVII, he was invisible to me for my first time. And upon my quick little replay, you only see him near the bar and Honey Bee Inn.
[5:00:36] <xxmagonx> 100%
[5:00:36] <%Owkono> like spiritbinding
[5:00:39] <corpsegoo> use the ability a bunch to get the proficiency
[5:00:43] <taquito_blade> I FUCKING LOVE THESE SWORD DESIGNS

[5:36:28] <Mr_Strut> Thirsty Boi
[5:36:30] <+CelioHogane> But they were monsters!
[5:36:33] <Meekest> TIME FOR GRINDING
[5:36:34] <scottishwolf> This looks pretty as fuck
[5:36:35] <%GabeSweetMan> That had different health values and that's it.
[5:36:35] <+Remery_> humans aren't monsters?
[5:36:36] <de1ete_forever> time to chew ass and kick bubblegum
[5:36:36] <$lotharrio> They need to put in a well in this slum. Literally everyone you meet is thirsty.
[5:36:40] <%ImmaCanuck> Just use guns 4Head
[5:36:42] <+exiled_blood> I mean, they had guns
[5:36:42] <Huntercd> Do they work for Don Corneo?

[5:36:52] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> yaaay
[5:36:52] <%j0ustar> I mean, they had guns.
[5:36:53] <julrave> usually a guy with any gun beats a guy with a sword
[5:36:53] <CuttleCrow> its not even the sword, its the main character hair
[5:37:00] <%StaceMcGate> holy shit, max has 22k viewers

[5:37:07] <%KaiserMario> Don Cornholio
[5:37:07] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> Overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer, and all that jazz
[5:37:16] <Darren716> I just realized, thats the Minh grind spot
[5:37:16] <%RyanTheRecluse> not even the hair, they should have noticed his polycount
[5:37:16] <KishinGrek> Gyns sdont work in rpgs
[5:37:18] <%floralkami> technically, it's only a 5ft sword, since Cloud is 5'8
[5:37:19] <RichochetForce> Katie! Woo!
[5:37:21] <%ImmaCanuck> NUMBER GO UP
[5:37:23] <%MonsterEnvy> Like them kicking you out of Avalanche

[5:37:23] <%optimasmaximas> katie Kreygasm
[5:37:23] <hassanico2> When will we run into Marie again?
[5:37:24] <stabbityrabbit> Clearly they thought Cloud's sword was for measuring proper social distancing.
[5:37:27] <%a_lucky_soul> ain't that nifty cloud just killed fifty
[5:37:31] <olaksi> As long as it isn't diverging into more of this filler
[5:37:31] <%sniffy77> BIGGEST NUMBER

[6:19:30] <%mechslayer71> I saw some of the spoilers for the changes, and I was wondering if it’d be worth it as a game aside from its job as a remake since I never played ff7. Is side content really that bad @olaksi

[6:20:10] <$lotharrio> But are energy drinks potions?

[6:20:44] <%rytyoung> So might as well stock up
[6:20:44] <RichochetForce> It's fascinating that Wedge straight up has nothing more than FAT and HUNGRY.
[6:20:45] <Brigins> we have a fat guy in our game. what should be his main drive as a character?...... he likes food.... and... eating

[6:57:04] <%JD_Lars> !uptime
[6:57:05] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 6h 57m.
[6:57:05] <%OneGorillionDollars> Jessie is the biggest coomer

[6:57:06] <DaniReDux> Amazing stream!

[6:57:15] <%ospreyworks> Well, thanks for the stream today Pat!
[6:57:17] <%espanishcanamurciana> @clintonificent I beat it on nightmare today! No infinite weapons
[6:57:20] <%ospreyworks> It was fun
[6:57:20] <%Guardiansaiyan> MAX just started
[6:57:22] <Axle13j> Loved the stream Pat, see ya guys, time for dinner and then rotating streams
[6:57:26] <%Darkfire346> HOW MUCH YOU WANT O BET JESSIE WAS HIRED BY CHRIS REDFIELD TO GET SPERM?
[6:57:44] <%Guardiansaiyan> @Darkfire346 I guess thats the reason she looks so much like Claire
[6:58:06] <clintonificent> @espanishcanamurciana good job! still enjoying playing the game over and over on Hardcore, that game is short but super fun to play over and over again (just like OG RE3)
[6:58:36] <+thatthiefoverthere> ahhhhhhh that was such a great stream
[6:58:41] <%mostundesired> Every time I think Jessie could not possibly come on any stronger, she does.
[6:58:43] <xxshadowxx416> re resistant is fun
[6:58:47] <%espanishcanamurciana> I started on inferno w the rocket launcher as a victory lap, 1/10 difficulty but got caught in a hallway with nemmy and he one shot right hooked me
[6:58:51] <%Guardiansaiyan> Going to Max...I am not subbed BUT it will be fun
[6:58:53] <+AnthraxJohnson> Did I miss the stream?
[6:58:54] <%floralkami> fuck, that last part made me laugh so much i LITERALLY almost passed out
[6:58:59] <%Guardiansaiyan> @AnthraxJohnson yes
[6:59:01] <%Guardiansaiyan> !uptime
[6:59:01] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 6h 59m.
[6:59:03] <%Darkfire346> jessie literally humped cloud on the back of a motorcycle.....
[6:59:07] <Jrocy247> They REALLY did justice for Jessie in this Remake
[6:59:11] <clintonificent> Pat must but goof juice in Jessie baby factory
[6:59:22] <%Afterman_> how is pat liking this
[6:59:23] <+thatthiefoverthere> Wedge appearing from off screen to enforce the Bro Code
[6:59:24] <%mostundesired> At this point, it's really just a test of how much T H I R S T Jessie can produce.
[6:59:36] <%floralkami> @darkfire346 wow, you really don't know what a hump looks like, huh
[6:59:42] <%j0ustar> Man, bummed I have to wait a year for the PC release. Either that or wait and see if the PS5 will be any good ( I never trust first hardware versions so )
[7:00:04] <+hod_fareview> @j0ustar patience is a virtue, my friend
[7:00:06] <%코코꾸라> @PatStaresAt Did you love this chapter as much as I did?
[7:00:08] <Jrocy247> Thoughts so far pat
[7:00:14] <clintonificent> where's the real Pat Boivin? what did you do with him?
[7:00:15] <+Pyroclase> I'm legit worried that Pat is gonna get spoiled by people being salty.
[7:00:16] <Final_Cosplay_Corps> good thing it brought floaties
[7:00:19] <Jontman42> at this rate Jessie will present herself to Cloud on all fours
[7:00:22] <YakumoYomi> I hunger
[7:00:24] <+thatthiefoverthere> FIRED UP FOR PIZZA
[7:00:26] <asurite_warrior> Pat Being an Australian tonight? and is the steam over?
[7:00:26] <%TalisKanju> Pat's going to play a TON of this game offscreen
[7:00:34] <%cvp5127> @PatStaresAt when do you think woolie will get to this?
[7:00:34] <%mostundesired> @Jontman42 Like a reverse crab
[7:00:36] <%j0ustar> @hod_fareview yes, yes it is
[7:00:37] <+Parlux> yeah.
[7:00:38] <+chaumiester> There was so much Sexual Tension in that game.....
[7:00:39] <%rytyoung> I'm playing FF 7 right now I'm gooooood
[7:00:47] <%rytyoung> Hopefully sooner
[7:00:47] <%ironhoundgaming> so good
[7:00:48] <%Diana869> @PatStaresAt hey pat i finished leveling my gathers which craftier should i start on first?
[7:00:49] <clintonificent> LOL
[7:00:50] <%j0ustar> never
[7:00:52] <CrazyMedicine> 2 years
[7:00:52] <%weissguard> Not even Leviathan can quench that girl's thirst.
[7:00:53] <%StaceMcGate> 2023
[7:00:53] <%Diana869> a year
[7:00:53] <MSN04_Sazabi> Too late LUL
[7:00:54] <%floralkami> Jessie is too fucking cute, omfg.
[7:00:55] <%optimasmaximas> when the next one comes out
[7:00:55] <SomersaultJustice> when no one cares anymore
[7:00:56] <%WhereIsWill> psaUp psaUp psaUp psaUp
[7:00:56] <$lotharrio> Pat, with Wedge's last warning, how much of Jesse is genuine and how much is her trying to manipulate Cloud?
[7:00:57] <Riccto> Are you going to go for the wedge romance route
[7:00:57] <%trueherobappo> Did pat finish the game already???
[7:00:58] <%ElkRiverDog> ElkRiverDog subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months! Shinra may be a bunch of evil corporate scumbags, but they installed one hell of a drainage system in Midgar if it can keep up with Jessie’s output!
[7:01:00] <%cvp5127> when part 2 comes out
[7:01:01] <+Hutchy9001> Loving watching you Stream, usually just ge the VODs , hope you are doing well!
[7:01:02] <%Maids4lyfe> LUL
[7:01:03] <%Nope80808> Show him punch girl and hill start tomorow
[7:01:10] <%coreyyotto> Like with Death STranding
[7:01:11] <%StaceMcGate> @PatStaresAt so no grinding off screen?
[7:01:11] <%Andrizzleton> May 2021
[7:01:12] <%Daniel_Is_I> @PatStaresAt You gonna talk spoilers with Clemps once you beat the game? Or wait for Woolie to spoilercast?
[7:01:15] <%Maids4lyfe> so long enough for everyone in his chat to spoil him
[7:01:19] <%Dragon_Batman> I'm behind, if he finished an lp he might push it out
[7:01:20] <clintonificent> and then he'll complain about spoilers LUL
[7:01:20] <%eanscrale> Well after the Dokapon death pool he can use the boost
[7:01:22] <xxshadowxx416> when part 2 and part 3 come out
[7:01:29] <+flexin_apex> woolie pave his own path
[7:01:30] <%rytyoung> It seems pretty hard to grind in this game
[7:01:30] <%floralkami> @lotharrio i think it's more about her being depressed as shit and holding it all in.
[7:01:32] <%TalisKanju> "In here" meaning Peach, Elmo, as well as Pat
[7:01:34] <+CelioHogane> That sounds like how he always does it, yes
[7:01:35] <%코코꾸라> You don't need to grind
[7:01:37] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> Grinding is probably not important
[7:01:38] <dan_g_v> grind everything
[7:01:39] <%코코꾸라> It's really well balanced
[7:01:40] <%Darkfire346> i love how they didnt tone down Tifas beefers.
[7:01:41] <%UvBenServed> No grinding Jessie off screen
[7:01:42] <%foreverN2dust> he's probably gonna go back to the Dad's room offscreen
[7:01:42] <42nfl19> @PatStaresAt So how much longer till "tutorial island" is over you think? What else is there to learn?
[7:01:50] <AvoidingTheCoronaVirus> i feel like the combat could be better, the ai party members aren't very smart
[7:01:58] <%optimasmaximas> oof
[7:02:01] <%rytyoung> Like since there's not random encounters enemies will only show up in certain areas
[7:02:01] <%Dragon_Batman> I would be careful about grinding, you might miss dialogue stuff
[7:02:05] <+CelioHogane> Only Jessie
[7:02:12] <arkv01> same, amazon won't send me mine until next wednesday :(
