[0:29:07] <AMajorTom> Use a microphone idiot
[0:29:07] <saltyblakey> Who the fuck is defending dragon age 2
[0:29:09] <retro_redux> Is this progress I see?

[0:29:17] <%Mateus84723> EAT THE MIC
[0:29:18] <+TheDude8D> go to da bed
[0:29:20] <alrobot2014> DAI DID NOT IMPROVE THE TACTICS CAMERA OR THE MAGIC SYSTEMs
[0:29:22] <TheEnablerr> explore elsewhere to climb
[0:29:23] <Mr_Strut> Paige eat mic instead of mudonald
[0:29:24] <%rumtumtugnutz> jojo is kinda stupid. that's why it's fun.
[0:29:25] <Whyverns> DA2 shills are the worst
[0:29:25] <Worldbrand> Oh shit I'm glad I made it for Below
[0:29:26] <%pimpinahz> DA:O is the best one
[0:29:28] <saltyblakey> press x to awesome
[0:29:29] <%mostundesired> I LIKE DA2, stop defending it when it makes no sense.
[0:29:29] <%KhonsuII> who said that?!
[0:29:32] <cacophanes> Paige hold on
[0:29:33] <Reanimator83> I hope Cthulhu comes out and power bombs this character through a table
[0:29:34] <+BarkerStreams> SHE RISES
[0:29:35] <%captainthunderwolf> @Sphincter_Spelunker In all fairness to Paige, I was bad at those puzzles the first time I played, and there's a reason they didn't come back. To be fair to me, though, I was in middle school when I tried those puzzles.
[0:29:37] <janitor_tulkas> DAI is a decent game, but in my opinion doesn't hold a candle to Pillars 1+2 or Tyranny
[0:29:37] <%lizard0tm> Pat, "Hold On" has now reached meme status in the discord
[0:29:38] <%Garthunox> DAI sucks hardstyle buddy
[0:29:38] <DSD24> Dragon Age 1 was the best one
[0:29:40] <leinadtonu> paige is a saint, that's what I think.
[0:29:47] <%deviljhojho94> Yo what the fuck werent we playing DAI
[0:29:47] <%0dokuro> is the couch talking?
[0:29:48] <roflwaffleauthoritah> this might as well not be a game

[0:30:03] <einSynd> Pat's Discord is Batman Forever now?
[0:30:04] <Djinnazz> hang on though.
[0:30:05] <sodium_station> DA2 is a trashfire game for trash people
[0:30:06] <SailingSaturn> wtf was that? cirWut
[0:30:06] <+Big_Hudson> Do we have an ETA for Dragon Age?
[0:30:07] <dakuman13> hold on is your requiem stand ability

[0:30:13] <%Garthunox> mèmè
[0:30:13] <%captainthunderwolf> @Gorgen Game's kinda buggy, and there's a lot of sidequest bloat.
[0:30:14] <%ToxInjection> apatBig MEMS
[0:30:16] <HentaiSenpai9K> @sodium_station WRONG
[0:30:17] <fiercefiresoul> Paige is still on that couch tolerating Pat right now. That already makes her Not-Wife of the Year.
[0:30:18] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> You chose settings
[0:30:22] <%doktorzee> oh shit wheres the discord?
[0:30:22] <%goodguydrew> jesus this game is boring

[0:30:31] <Gorgen> @captainthunderwolf hows the story?
[0:30:35] <$spacehouse> DA2 Is a trashfire
[0:30:37] <deity_majora> but Peach is blind...
[0:30:41] <+DZiffer> Dragon Age 2 suffered from the same EA garbage changes as ME3, it was barely a RPG, how is that a improvement?
[0:30:42] <thegerudokin> !discord
[0:30:46] <Worldbrand> I like this game, but you gotta be in a certain mood for it I think
[0:30:47] <BaslerJones> did Pat do a save transfer for dai ?

[0:31:08] <SwiftFission> Hold on is what happened.
[0:31:09] <DSD24> Also Dragon Age 2 had like no dev time cause they wanted it out fast
[0:31:10] <BlackEncephalonGIO> lol
[0:31:11] <%0dokuro> DA 2 tried streamlining combat, but did it in the worse ways
[0:31:12] <roflwaffleauthoritah> make pepis
[0:31:15] <Gorgen> Good thing i played through DAO like 10 times then
[0:31:18] <rockworm> Dragon Age looks different than I remember

[0:31:47] <+Pyr0_Fr0st> Someone in @AngriestPat 's discord play Hold on by the Goo Goo Dolls
[0:31:51] <TheEnablerr> he's right

[0:32:56] <%mostundesired> Jack Black deserves it god damn it.
[0:32:59] <%AncelDeLambert> also, people will leave once he starts actually streaming

[0:33:04] <Warbot40> Eh it makes sense
[0:33:04] <Tisaric> The way he did it was funny enough to get that millino
[0:33:05] <%snow_bush> The Templar were right.
[0:33:05] <TheEnablerr> Jack Black is a cool guy
[0:33:05] <janitor_tulkas> Screw Jack Black
[0:33:05] <%GohanEgret> Jack Black was on Korean variety shows, he's cool in my book
[0:33:05] <+PrimordialDonut> Now lets see how consistent he is at uploading
[0:33:05] <Thomas100273> Only Jem is truly outrageous.
[0:33:06] <+Sp3ctre48> Mage Tower is good until the Fade part
[0:33:06] <yourliteraldog> Who rembers brutal legend
[0:33:06] <%goodguydrew> is something happening now?
[0:33:07] <HuskyGreene> truly
[0:33:08] <%akaAxi0m> JEM rather

[0:33:12] <%PipIV> you can get a new tenacious d tattoo
[0:33:13] <+JoeyJoestarJuniorShabadoo> are you concerned celebrities will come take all the good streaming jobs
[0:33:14] <sodium_station> Deeps roads are the worst part of DA:O. Still better than the best parts of DA2
[0:33:14] <%LewisBell302> well im going to bed
[0:33:14] <SailingSaturn> SBFP worked their way up from the bottom cirSlain

[0:33:18] <HanPaul> Jem is pertty outyrageous
[0:33:18] <%NWR_James> HOLD ON
[0:33:19] <roflwaffleauthoritah> I want jack black to mount me in my sleep
[0:33:19] <ckkc1> Megalovania
[0:33:20] <%Garthunox> he was a video game
[0:33:20] <%violetheart> Jack Black is popular for a million reasons. Of course he'd get a million subs right away.
[0:33:23] <+ChaosVulpes> I honestly thought that guy was dead...
[0:33:23] <Worldbrand> That lantern runs on soul fuel
[0:33:24] <SwiftFission> He better play brutal legend
[0:33:25] <stigna1> I mean, he used a meglovania remix of the fortnite theme so its gotta be good, right?
[0:33:26] <mr_slaide> WE DEMAND ELMO!
[0:33:26] <Novillion> I love lamp
[0:33:27] <dekkitout> he's funny till we hear about whatever he tweeted 10 years ago...
[0:33:27] <DSD24> Remember when Jack Black was in Biodome?
[0:33:29] <RichAnvils> When's the Red and Black podcast? @AngriestPat
[0:33:29] <%KhonsuII> his first playthrough should be of Brutal Legend
[0:33:31] <%PipIV> nachooooooooooooooooo
[0:33:32] <%captainthunderwolf> @DSD24 That's not how you spell Deep Roads, friend. The Fade quest, as PART of the Mage Tower specifically, though, is the worst quest in that game.
[0:33:34] <BlackEncephalonGIO> Get a new PC
[0:33:34] <%rosemon5001> @MrBorisMakarov reee i wanted to be a blind cave slime hate yall thanks for the eye
[0:33:35] <+StrawberryPantsu> New Computer
[0:33:36] <+Sp3ctre48> I really like the Deep Roads segment in Origins
[0:33:37] <Sunstalker> I hope it ends up getting made fun of during one of his movies
[0:33:37] <+redanimator> how about pewds rewind is now more likes then youtube rewind
[0:33:39] <zaptar13> @mrborismakarov you can't. Cease.
[0:33:39] <Thomas100273> So will Jack Black's first LP be Brutal Legend?
[0:33:40] <%BlackJack607> Jack Black is like pat but better
[0:33:45] <%PipIV> tenacious d was in biodome
[0:33:48] <+Shady_Zaku> WOOO
[0:33:50] <+StrawberryPantsu> Wait
[0:33:51] <BlackEncephalonGIO> Make a new PC
[0:33:52] <+StrawberryPantsu> PS4
[0:33:54] <Tisaric> All I hope is that he never actually uploads a single video with video games in it
[0:33:54] <%0dokuro> Honestly a new PS might be announced this year...
[0:33:55] <%RichardRasmus> @SailingSaturn i mean they got boosted by machinima, not really working from the bottom
[0:34:04] <+Tonku_the_Red> I mean, PS4 has some pretty great games coming up hat aren't on PC.
[0:34:06] <$vectorcannonready> Hold on
[0:34:06] <BlackEncephalonGIO> You can always upgrade the GPU later on
[0:34:07] <janitor_tulkas> Jack Black is like Matt and equally as annoying.
[0:34:09] <+Shady_Zaku> Hey everyone
[0:34:13] <Valentinius_Anodyne> You can make a fine PC for less than a thousand
[0:34:13] <IShadowStrykerI> wait i walked away for a few minutes, what happened to dragon age?
[0:34:19] <SailingSaturn> @RichardRasmus still nobodies beforehand cirTan
[0:34:21] <black_ice_mai> Fuck PS4, the PS5 is a year out
[0:34:21] <%0dokuro> We switched to the mobile edition
[0:34:22] <Lewisisphat> PS4 has bloodborne so
[0:34:23] <SkewerSTARSTREAM> All this DA talk's reminding me that i still need fo finish DA:O... BUT THE DEEP ROADS ARE SUCH A DRAG!!
[0:34:23] <RamenRiderZ> Jack Black is rocking that exploded beard though
[0:34:26] <HanPaul> how much is Pat paying the donation bot?
[0:34:28] <BlackEncephalonGIO> PS4 eventually they'll stop making new games for it
[0:34:31] <%0dokuro> (Has streaming issues)
[0:34:33] <%NWR_James> HOLD ON
[0:34:33] <whatatkins> PILLARS

[0:35:44] <%captainthunderwolf> @DSD24 My big gripe is that the Deep Roads is a big maze with repetitive environments, whereas that's a flaw that only some of the Mage Tower has and ALL of the Deep Roads has. But that's just personal preference.

[0:36:24] <DSD24> @captainthunderwolf True I won't deny that the Deep Roads did get repetitive, whereas the Fade was just a huge drag

[0:36:45] <%bread_assassin> Pat, ME is on the baby difficulty, you don't need to restart just so you can min-max it.
[0:36:45] <+vG_Chance> so far this game is lacking payoff, i really hope something cool happens to get dem vidya game hooks in
[0:36:47] <Tonyzx15> Zero means Zero pat

[0:37:13] <%captainthunderwolf> @DSD24 I'm with you. And the insulting free "+1 Attribute" interactables mostly annoyed me because there's literally no stat in that game where a single point of improvement, even for free, matters.
[0:37:16] <Gorgen> give paige a TPS to play so she can learn to to play them
[0:37:17] <%0dokuro> stream go up, character go down

[0:41:55] <T_Sasquatch> hella
[0:41:56] <$vectorcannonready> Tali is best waifu
[0:41:59] <DSD24> What about Cora in Andromeda?
[0:42:00] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> You don't romance Miranda, you fuck her
[0:42:01] <%captainthunderwolf> Wait, ASHLEY is the worst, I'm fucking DUMB
[0:42:01] <%ToxInjection> @captainthunderwolf I raise Jacob
[0:42:02] <DSD24> She's cool
[0:42:03] <+hoenhime344> pat obliviousz to cute romance

[0:42:04] <foreverN2dust> This inventory is filling pretty quick
[0:42:05] <dakuman13> all we need is some lo-fi hiphop and we're set
[0:42:05] <%Shady_Zaku> Patella, Pat flavour Neutella? apatSmug
[0:42:08] <janitor_tulkas> Yeah but Miranda has that rocking backside
[0:42:08] <%BenicioDelPollo> Tali belongs with Garrus
[0:42:09] <%Mantorok06> Pat is Paige's favorite bone, y'all heard it live
[0:42:09] <+SuichiTanaka> LUL
[0:42:13] <+TheDude8D> confused fun
[0:42:17] <miguelrod777> TALI IS MINE
[0:42:18] <BlackEncephalonGIO> You're tearing me apaaaaht Leeeesaa!
[0:42:22] <%captainthunderwolf> If you romanced Ashley, you fucking deserved her heel-turn in ME3.
[0:42:22] <%0dokuro> Tali and Garrus, best choices
[0:42:25] <ArtThouBored> No Romance is worse than Jacobs
[0:42:29] <BlackEncephalonGIO> Oh hai Mahrk.
[0:42:34] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@Rellim80)
[0:42:35] <ArtThouBored> Fact
[0:42:36] <DSD24> @ArtThouBored Oof
[0:42:38] <stigna1> tha's where he started...
[0:42:38] <+redthebaron> is there like anything to this game or you only walk and look at things from far away

[0:42:47] <$SGrim> @miguelrod777 bitch, I WILL fight you rooREE
[0:42:51] <+Tonku_the_Red> Tali is the ONLY Acceptable romance in ME.
[0:42:51] <+JenovasPuppet> No no no. DA2 is underated, DAI is a bad game
[0:42:53] <Zdawg39> lol
[0:42:56] <%softcatmemoirs> @captainthunderwolf you don't have to choose. ashley AND miranda are the goddamn worst apatDab
[0:42:56] <%0dokuro> its fine
[0:42:56] <DSD24> Inquisition is a better game than DA2
[0:42:57] <%snow_bush> This is true. 2 is a downgrade
[0:42:58] <$Yakobro> HOLD ON
[0:43:01] <stigna1> yo da 2 sucks but Da; I is pretty alright. Its just different.
[0:43:02] <%pilgrimsayswhat> IT WAS FINE

[0:43:07] <dakuman13> this game is probably somehow better than shadow of tomb raider
[0:43:07] <crimsonops99> Tali yay Ashley nay
[0:43:08] <%Shady_Zaku> Hello!
[0:43:09] <%captainthunderwolf> Wait I'm still wrong fucking LIEUTENANT CHAMBERS is the worst option. SHE becomes a BLOND in ME3 and GOES CRAZY.

[1:08:26] <Valdorick> "I'll make my master the slave in my dungeon, if you get my drift"
[1:08:28] <AVelvetOwl> Although Lohse is great as the main character, since you can curb her edgelord tendencies

[1:12:29] <blackbeaking> Paige would love fane

[1:12:31] <+Typhaeon> FIST mage
[1:12:32] <Coystick> Bonu Zonu
[1:12:34] <shlaggori> dont start skeleton on first playthrough
[1:12:35] <+Noxybaru> Your starting class isn't AS important as you think because you can pretty much do whatever
[1:12:39] <%PalmtopNami> some tupe of mage
[1:12:41] <CapCasual> CONJURER!

[1:12:48] <crimsonops99> Skeleton can wear peoples faces lol
[1:12:49] <TalisKanju> Paige loves Fane's bones
[1:12:49] <%KaironFortressKnight> Why is the Skeleton doing all kinds of sassy poses?
[1:12:50] <%templar010> hes a good wizard
[1:12:50] <AVelvetOwl> I don't think Fane has the best story, but if you don't take him along, you miss out on like 25% of the plot
[1:12:51] <geekjacob> skeleton warrior
[1:12:51] <%hawk_rush> THAT DUAL STAFF IS SICK
[1:12:52] <Jontman42> Boneman dressed in more bones
[1:12:53] <%captainthunderwolf> @AngriestPat Every preset is decent, but Battlemage is very very good.
[1:12:56] <%sylveonIRL> MORE bones
[1:12:56] <DudeLjustDudeL> Boney man wearing bones.
[1:12:57] <%mostundesired> Wait... Playing THIS GAME with a controller? DansGame
[1:12:59] <Dio_TR> Magic is OP in this game @AngriestPat
[1:12:59] <dekkitout> da da da da da da dadadada skeleto warrior
[1:13:00] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> wait that caps wasn't an automod
[1:13:01] <+Joemomma360> rogue is best for him as he has skeleton key
[1:13:01] <Novillion> there is free reroll so it doesn't matter
[1:13:03] <CelioHogane> Make a custom character!
[1:13:03] <%sparrrow_> were these characters in the first game?
[1:13:03] <+dylin456> big magic
[1:13:04] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> we banning caps now?
[1:13:04] <BlackEncephalonGIO> How does he lick his lips?
[1:13:05] <%lizard0tm> Ainz Ooal Gown playthrough!
[1:13:06] <+Noxybaru> Making your own character is the way to go imo. I mean it is an RPG
[1:13:07] <BlackEncephalonGIO> lol
[1:13:08] <subjectivelyclaire> hmmm, probably aughta go through all those origin stories again just to be sure you're picking the right toon
[1:13:08] <CelioHogane> MAKE A LIZARD SKELETON!
[1:13:08] <+DZiffer> You don't even need a respec mod
[1:13:08] <%BlackJack607> If you're gunna play Fane or any skeleton I suggest going two handed necromancy cause the more damage you do the more healing you do to yourself
[1:13:10] <viciousgrim> go for a death knight build
[1:13:12] <rockworm> I hope Pat knows that Undead makes the game harder as healing spells hurts you
[1:13:12] <%0dokuro> Barrels are OP in this game
[1:13:14] <HerrDemsus> there is respeccs already in the game,,, (after sevral hours)
[1:13:14] <knifeymcstab> skeleton wearing skeletons... thats fucked
[1:13:14] <HyraFukit> @AngriestPat you can respecc at any time when past the first island..
[1:13:14] <%moogleboy1984> Did you install the Animal Friend for free mod?
[1:13:15] <+JenovasPuppet> Hope you've got poison pots available
[1:13:15] <%BlackJack607> Fextralife is love
[1:13:17] <+kylejefferies> But the game lets you respec for free
[1:13:18] <+dantegus> canonically wizard

[1:13:20] <Mr_Strut> COWARD
[1:13:20] <AVelvetOwl> Aww yeah checking out builds already
[1:13:21] <Coystick> Wikidot>Fextralife
[1:13:22] <%KaironFortressKnight> Time for minmaxing I guess
[1:13:22] <verelme> respecc is included in the game...
[1:13:24] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> not wikia
[1:13:24] <SwiftFission> Yes
[1:13:24] <strangelee> Summoner's are probably the best class to play
[1:13:26] <Bouldus> its really bad
[1:13:26] <Jontman42> That's like me wearing a meat suit
[1:13:29] <ShadowZiggy> Hi Pat. Hope you're well
[1:13:29] <%deviljhojho94> Fuc k off moobot
[1:13:30] <TalisKanju> He could have said NOTHING and Paige would have liked him.
[1:13:31] <SwindlerOfProgress> @the_lady_alustriel It's now timed out, yeah.
[1:13:33] <vexicbayn> the chad Fextralife
[1:13:35] <%texaporte> fapstralife?
[1:13:35] <Bouldus> they dont really check anything they say
[1:13:36] <AVelvetOwl> Summoners are the easiest but also pretty bording
[1:13:37] <%captainthunderwolf> Fextralife is the jank cousin of Wikipedia with all the hot numbers you need
[1:13:39] <%Xanderbats> Warfare + Polymorph
[1:13:41] <+DZiffer> There is a mirror after chapter one with which you can change everything as many times as you want
[1:13:42] <Implosivestar> Death Knight Warrior skeleton man with master key Kappa
[1:13:46] <+StrikeV3> get this fucking goomba to make his own
[1:13:46] <+Noxybaru> Fucking fextralife taking over all the game wikis
[1:13:47] <batter_sempai> @jontman42 it's like a human wearing leather i guess
[1:13:48] <knifeymcstab> @jontman42 thats what I'm saying lol
[1:13:48] <danknugglit> Moobot is bloodthirsty
[1:13:50] <%RichardRasmus> @verelme yea but you have to get pretty bit in before you get respec
[1:13:51] <+Noxybaru> makes me nervous
[1:13:52] <Oqzar> you dont really need to
[1:13:56] <%hawk_rush> fextrallife is so good
[1:13:57] <Lukas_Ipsum> sounds like a furry site
[1:13:58] <Oqzar> game isnt that hard
[1:13:58] <TalisKanju> Fane's voice could be fartgas and Paige would still choose him
[1:13:58] <%sparrrow_> Pat is a min max GOD
[1:14:03] <+G_Thunders> You can redo everything after chapter 1
[1:14:12] <Luesagna00> @angriestpat can u even grow up to be wargreymon?
[1:14:13] <Bouldus> fextralife is not great, its ok/passable
[1:14:13] <Shinigami0215> I can agree with you Pat, I'm not very good at char creation myself
[1:14:14] <%MegboyManuel> Pat is the skeleton, what a surprise
[1:14:14] <strangelee> Never put a point into anything other than your core stats, and never spread out over more than 3
[1:14:14] <+brycart97> just go polymorph + warfare and dump it all into strength
[1:14:17] <InsomniacPersona> Should download some class mods to add some new classes and abilities
[1:14:17] <+WhyIDie> why learn about a game on your own when you can CHEAT?
[1:14:17] <+MrComics> what site is he using?
[1:14:18] <+brycart97> win the game
[1:14:20] <Sunstalker> fextralife is big nerds, wikidot is the true savior
[1:14:24] <%sparrrow_> @AngriestPat hey pat you ever check out Path of Exile?
[1:14:25] <dekkitout> are these words?
[1:14:25] <Hiruzen93> BLOOD BOW
[1:14:27] <arcaderabbit48> Its kinda weird starting out with the intros of like a magic popstar, and an ancient lich wizard, only for their actual class to be totally random
[1:14:28] <BlackEncephalonGIO> The Plutonic Friendship
[1:14:30] <%LogothX> health drain probably
[1:14:30] <%captainthunderwolf> The early Rogue skills are fucking strong, by the way.
[1:14:32] <strangelee> bleed bow
[1:14:33] <+CezrDaPleazr> Hi Pat
[1:14:33] <wookie5358> One day, I'll beat this game. Love it to death, but always get distracted before finishing
[1:14:33] <+CarlosEoM> big cheat

[1:14:40] <booglesnurf> Be a bard with low Int
[1:14:40] <Wafflesisdog> DO LONE WOLF SUMMONER
[1:14:40] <HyraFukit> Whats the point of looking up builds when you can get away with doing anything and everything on normal
[1:14:41] <Etherealizer> Sanguine Bowman is good
[1:14:43] <BlackEncephalonGIO> The Boner of Doom
[1:14:43] <+EerieOoze> @AngriestPat warning about that FortJoyRespec mod, if that's what you're using. There is a floating glitch in a dungeon; not game breaking and it may have been patched since.
[1:14:44] <+Noxybaru> I forget how shit got rebalanced with the definitive edition or whatever it is
[1:14:45] <dekkitout> iz blud

[1:16:27] <AVelvetOwl> Oh wow this looks weird with a controller
[1:16:28] <InsomniacPersona> You should just play by ear Pat, I found divinity way more fun to just do that
[1:16:32] <%bigwow> what website is he using for builds?
[1:16:32] <+brycart97> looks just like pat
[1:16:35] <%mostundesired> Fuck off, a bearded skeleton is amazing. Don't insult Brook this way.

[1:16:58] <Novillion> free reroll
[1:17:00] <%rdark_ksu> not by ear, you will go deaf
[1:17:01] <DudeLjustDudeL> Having high strength when you literally have no muscles.
[1:17:01] <%OwlLightningMage> Playing by ear in a game like this is for crazy people
[1:17:01] <+boratebuffer> You can respec at any time
[1:17:02] <%Fadedblank247> must min/max or the head goblins go up

[1:17:07] <%AncelDeLambert> @AngriestPat you can respec as much as you want once you're past the island
[1:17:08] <AVelvetOwl> This game can be really hard if you don't know what you're doing, but is generally fairly forgiving with stats
[1:17:08] <%tuesti> is paige next to pat?
[1:17:09] <booglesnurf> Play by tongue
[1:17:09] <Virokwet> whats with the music
[1:17:11] <Valdorick> Pat is too Min/HUGE to every play an RPG blind
[1:17:12] <RCtiger0> This game is already looking complex and complicated to me.
[1:17:12] <%0dokuro> Probably should follow some guide since later on you will get wrecked
[1:17:12] <+Noxybaru> TALIMANCER AHOY
[1:17:14] <+DZiffer> You don't even need mod for it
[1:17:14] <Chipshandon12> just play by ear, and you can always cheat to fix it

[1:19:39] <+ChaosVulpes> Tonight's stream: "Oops, All Character Creation!"

[1:19:41] <Luesagna00> Is the game audio going in and out for anyone else?.?
[1:19:42] <knifeymcstab> i feel like this character should have a shit eating grin.

[1:19:57] <Bouldus> yes but it works with 2 people
[1:19:58] <BlackEncephalonGIO> Coming to a theatre near you
[1:19:58] <+adavis72> Keep opportunist if you are tanking
[1:19:58] <%didyouthinkofthis> its still super good
[1:19:59] <%softcatmemoirs> lone wolf is WAY weaker but somehow still better than a 4 man party
[1:20:01] <shlaggori> get oppurtunist
[1:20:02] <%mostundesired> No, it scales fine, they changed how you get skills
[1:20:03] <@StridentSong> Lone Wolf is still good if you're running two people that both have it

[1:20:17] <Bouldus> lone wolf works with a single companion
[1:20:17] <%Xanderbats> Living Armor is amazing too

[1:24:23] <Virokwet> hey guys is the ps4 version of this worth getting
[1:24:25] <+Fenlig> I just put 100hrs into this with a friend, its so fantastic
[1:24:26] <T_Sasquatch> im confused, cant you create a character ?
[1:24:30] <+brycart97> one of the best games in the last 10 years imo
[1:24:31] <%captainthunderwolf> @ChaosVulpes Yeah, the name's kind of meta because there are people there who get transformed into mindless zombies who are stuck in a permanent state of self-aware misery.
[1:24:31] <%hawk_rush> Is there an online aspect to this?
[1:24:31] <%NumbusPlays> how do you sedate a skeleton
[1:24:31] <MKUltima> How do you sedate a skeleton
[1:24:37] <BlackEncephalonGIO> How dare they enslave me for summoning demons and killing people lol
[1:24:39] <+brycart97> yes @T_Sasquatch
[1:24:41] <$ThePaleSage> how do you sedate a skeleton?
[1:24:41] <Methados> You can. Pat just picked a character instead
[1:24:42] <danknugglit> Its a warcraft
[1:24:42] <Tomschiii> its so much better alone than with a group of friends
[1:24:44] <AVelvetOwl> With bone hurting juice
[1:24:45] <%mostundesired> Hey dude, you can pretend to be an elf
[1:24:48] <CrypticMochi> Welcome to the Abyss of Happiness

[1:24:51] <Valdorick> They inject it straight into the Marrow
[1:24:57] <mayorrev> ANOTHER SKULL
[1:25:05] <Mr_Strut> I am skeleton jelly.
[1:25:07] <T_Sasquatch> @brycart97 but pat decided just to play as an existing character right ?
[1:25:08] <deardiarya> pat listen to me
[1:25:12] <%rumtumtugnutz> how do you roofie a skeleton? you have to digest tranquilizers for them to work.
[1:25:12] <%captainthunderwolf> Undead-only dialogue right now, BTW
[1:25:12] <AlexanderTheConquerer> is that paige talking?
[1:25:13] <Daxalog> Is it ALL/Mostly voice acted? Cause if soo thats an instant buy then
[1:25:14] <deardiarya> pat
[1:25:16] <RCtiger0> Should have called him Ainz Ooal Gown
[1:25:20] <geekjacob> hieratic for your transgrason before the holy god emperor of mankind you shall die
[1:25:21] <dekkitout> i want to take his face-offffff
[1:25:23] <%Remery_> HOT
[1:25:28] <%captainthunderwolf> @Daxalog Virtually all characters are voiced, yes.
[1:25:30] <danknugglit> Naked skull Kreygasm
[1:25:35] <Daxalog> Oh yeah!
[1:25:39] <Meekest> That's a great line
[1:25:40] <+WhyIDie> no lungs, no tongue, no lips
[1:25:43] <%hawk_rush> that's a good line
[1:25:43] <AMajorTom> None of his meat can swell
[1:25:43] <+brycart97> you get a ton of unique dialogue and character specific sidestory so theres really no reason not to @T_Sasquatch considering you can change appearance anyways
[1:25:44] <%AbnormalVoid> he's Skelepathic
[1:25:49] <JinjaBredMan> its ALL voice acted except the og pc
[1:25:51] <%0dokuro> puns
[1:25:53] <MKUltima> Turn into a skeleton
[1:25:54] <+Dovakhin573> Dont you disrepect Ainz Sama
[1:25:55] <danknugglit> LUL
[1:25:55] <Methados> Time for the Bone Zone
[1:25:56] <%sparrrow_> He isn't a human skeleton, that skull was human
[1:25:58] <Bouldus> different ship?
[1:25:58] <Admiral_PopnFresh> That's racist to assume, Paige
[1:25:59] <BlackEncephalonGIO> He's a telepathic skeleton
[1:26:01] <%AbnormalVoid> Kappa
[1:26:03] <+ChaosVulpes> That's the most fucking rad character ever, telepath skeleton who wears the fleshy masks of his fallen enemies
[1:26:04] <Sr901> Oh man I finally made one of these live
[1:26:04] <+combomaniadeluxe> is the ps4 version of this game good chat?
[1:26:06] <InsomniacPersona> Fane is an oldblood Skelly, that head was a newblood
[1:26:06] <AVelvetOwl> Boy howdy this looks annoying to fix with a controller
[1:26:09] <missingangle> Skelepathic
[1:26:12] <BlackEncephalonGIO> HE uses the brain that he doesn't have to do telepathy lol
[1:26:13] <%rdark_ksu> skeletons have no lips they couldnt articulate shit
[1:26:16] <%pectusumbra> people can just feel what he's putting out. Feel it IN THEIR BONES
[1:26:22] <%BlackJack607> This has to be one of my favorite RPGs.
[1:26:22] <Bouldus> why is the boat different
[1:26:23] <danknugglit> Ocd go down
[1:26:26] <Fetidmongrel> Looks like we're headin into the bone zone fellas
[1:26:32] <%Iplatypusprime> wait this isnt dragon age
[1:26:37] <pillowwasp> Skeletons are ghosts possessing their own bodies
[1:26:39] <+Fenlig> So this game kinda plays like Xcom in combat and we all know how Pat plays Xcom :D
[1:26:39] <+brycart97> its basically dragon age
[1:26:41] <%captainthunderwolf> @ChaosVulpes He's also a borderline sociopath who canonically has eaten people out of curiosity. Fane's neat.
[1:26:44] <Torivore> Vibrates the small bones in your ear
[1:26:44] <%0dokuro> its better
[1:26:45] <AVelvetOwl> Play dead is one of the best skills in the game
[1:26:46] <knifeymcstab> @danknugglit min/max go up
[1:26:46] <T_Sasquatch> @brycart97 rpgs NotLikeThis sigh all these prerequistes to know before starting

[1:26:55] <AVelvetOwl> Yes it is
[1:26:58] <%captainthunderwolf> Time Warp is FUCKING BUSTED
[1:26:59] <strangelee> Unless you want to be a Female Dwarf, Male Elf, Female Undead or Female Lizard. They have no preexisting character
[1:26:59] <AVelvetOwl> But he can't use that for a while
[1:27:03] <danknugglit> Hold on go up?
[1:27:05] <+ChaosVulpes> @captainthunderwolf Down right Neato! :3

[1:27:07] <RCtiger0> How can you play dead when you are already dead
[1:27:08] <+brycart97> @T_Sasquatch this game is amazing but if you dont like rpgs it'll definitely be too RPG for you LUL
[1:27:09] <ArtThouBored> So Inquisition was abust I take it?
[1:27:09] <%captainthunderwolf> And Source Shield is ALSO FUCKING BUSTED
[1:27:13] <foreverN2dust> uhnf Kreygasm
[1:27:13] <+Shini6arcane> is it really playing dead if hes a skelebro
[1:27:14] <%hawk_rush> I can't wait to get this game when it goes on sale
[1:27:17] <%captainthunderwolf> Source Shield is really fucking good, guys.

[1:42:38] <%Everpresent_Overseer> I am back, I see Pat is finally playing a game
[1:42:39] <KaldorDraig0> @tegas_ DAI
[1:42:39] <Zdawg39> they changed the tutorial
[1:42:39] <+buttdirt> "ah geez, gotta lie down to get over that hot searing pain"
[1:42:43] <freddyf> SLEEP TO QUENCH THE FIYAH
[1:42:44] <%hawk_rush> so many people having their messages deleted, wtf are you guys saying??
[1:42:46] <dukenux> Just sleep it off 4Head
[1:42:46] <%Shady_Zaku> YEEEA PENANCE STAAARE
[1:42:51] <+Shadowstay> Beds put out flames ? Lol
[1:42:59] <%0dokuro> cause we already went Below
[1:43:01] <Bouldus> actually should probably jsut take all the movement attack right? take the dashs and the lelemental teleports and stuff
[1:43:03] <+brycart97> i think they went out just before he lied down
[1:43:04] <HellsCherry> I tune in just in time to see Him on fire
[1:43:07] <jake1094> oooohhhh now i see lol
[1:43:09] <+tegas_> I liked DAI alot, but it had quiet a few parts that made it feel like an mmo, which is no bueno.
[1:43:09] <%laserbeaming> So, that's the new Tutorial eh?
[1:43:12] <%Sirculbs> @angriestpat Well... If ya had kept the ooze barrel you'd of had the option to make unlimited poison pots as a healing source... But whatevs lol
[1:43:13] <strangelee> The Journal was such ass
[1:43:17] <+tegas_> quite* even.
[1:43:19] <%velemi> it was not good
[1:43:21] <JinjaBredMan> could've skipped it if u wanted
[1:43:23] <Zdawg39> it was the worst
[1:43:26] <+OptimusNog> Why is there a portrait of steve buschemi in the back?>
[1:43:26] <QuaiRolDor> where is pat streaming, thats not his house?
[1:43:27] <knifeymcstab> first Face Off. now Ghost Rider. wow
[1:43:30] <%sparrrow_> does he mean original sin 1?
[1:43:37] <Zdawg39> no he means this game
[1:43:39] <%0dokuro> his home planet
[1:43:43] <SweepTheLegoMyEggo> that was a fast crazy talk
[1:43:44] <strangelee> no, the original edition of 2
[1:43:47] <lewdskeletor13> That’s Steve Buschelmo
[1:43:49] <%hawk_rush> @QuaiRolDor he and paige moved to their new house
[1:43:52] <%captainthunderwolf> @Bouldus Phoenix Jump is also Warfare I think; Poly gets the Wings ability which is actually a slightly better leap because it has further range and a shorter cooldown. There's about four of those jump skills, actually, and they're all really good.
[1:43:55] <QuaiRolDor> oh
[1:43:57] <+brycart97> this is a pretty good video game
[1:43:58] <QuaiRolDor> thats cool
[1:44:00] <%MagickBurritoh> @QuaiRolDor his secret sex dungeon
[1:44:01] <%Remery_> Doggy
[1:44:03] <Brackleforth> HOT
[1:44:04] <%reaped_psyche> @OptimusNog That's Steve Bushelmo, thank you very much.
[1:44:07] <Valdorick> Kinky
[1:44:08] <+OptimusNog> @lewdskeletor13 who's that?
[1:44:12] <Torivore> They patch the log like Morrowind?
[1:44:13] <heresfranky> this games fun with friends
[1:44:17] <+Shini6arcane> does a skeleton need to worry about a tight collar?
[1:44:18] <QuaiRolDor> thanks for the info @hawk_rush
[1:44:20] <%Prism_Wing> The other side of his dick?
[1:44:21] <Bloodninja15> I liked the old journal
[1:44:21] <heresfranky> who kill eachother with explosions.
[1:44:23] <vingadivo> this game sold like 5 times more than pillars 2
[1:44:27] <lewdskeletor13> @optimusnog Just a dumb gimmick character
[1:44:28] <%hawk_rush> @QuaiRolDor No worries!
[1:44:28] <Brackleforth> treat me like the dog I am
[1:44:33] <Bouldus> @captainthunderwolf theres also that areothurgy one, theres so many, kinda want to make a character with jsut the movement attacks :P
[1:44:33] <strangelee> @captainthunderwolf I would say Wings is worse since it has an arch that terrain interferes with
[1:44:34] <%0dokuro> Mystic
[1:44:41] <%captainthunderwolf> They added a really great fluff-only interaction in the Definitive Edition, actually, where you can try to save her life if you want to.
[1:44:45] <Punchweasel> She should take her own advice.
[1:44:45] <+tegas_> Wine for the Skeleton?
[1:44:48] <+JFKRobot> I'm just about to finish this game. Enjoying it so far
[1:44:49] <knifeymcstab> Is that Pat's way of saying he shit himself?
[1:44:57] <dukenux> Bitch i m a skellington
[1:45:00] <$Yakobro> Jebaited
[1:45:01] <%NovaKnightmare> Im glad I got back in time to watch Pat play Divinity
[1:45:06] <dukenux> wine just flows through me
[1:45:13] <strangelee> The Huntsman one and the Scoundral ones are much better for pure movement possibilties
[1:45:13] <%sparrrow_> no more jizz
[1:45:14] <%captainthunderwolf> @strangelee They made it a lot better in Definitive, and I've had the mod to fix that for a while. But you're not wrong, in Vanilla the arc can completely fuck it.
[1:45:14] <$codussalpha> wow, she's a bitch
[1:45:17] <%AbnormalVoid> or cum
[1:45:18] <+Skeletorexplains> Turn her into a mask

[1:46:55] <%deviljhojho94> Different things
[1:46:59] <%captainthunderwolf> @sparrrow_ All the MCs are "Sourcerors", which is sort of just a term for magic-users who can use the REALLY GOOD magic.
[1:46:59] <JinjaBredMan> all the cheats
[1:47:00] <%Mateus84723> big cheats
[1:47:01] <dukenux> because i thik i saw it on the sub, and was like "oh god"
[1:47:04] <$codussalpha> @deviljhojho94 their word for magic, allowing them to use Sourcerer as a "clever" play on sorcerer
[1:47:07] <%deviljhojho94> MURDER D:

[1:47:29] <%gespenst25> don't sneak they'll think you did it.
[1:47:30] <Hanbei1708> wha happeh
[1:47:31] <%captainthunderwolf> I actually hate "Sourceror" as a term, by the way. I just don't like that pun.
[1:47:34] <StubYourToe> Don't mind me, just a barrel
[1:47:36] <Valdorick> Just like your Japanese vidja games!

[1:47:49] <dukenux> @hawk_rush that's alright, i preffer DoS anyway
[1:47:53] <%captainthunderwolf> @brycart97 Hey man, the Scoundrel one that lets you stab a motherfucker like six times is pretty solid.
[1:47:55] <strangelee> This series is filled to bursting with puns
[1:48:09] <Gorgen> This man has been stabbed 28 times in the chest.
[1:48:14] <%laserbeaming> Do you have Fane's fancy mask? You could turn into and elf and eat the body
[1:48:18] <%Taisuru> Wait, is this the start of the game?
[1:48:19] <%deviljhojho94> This campaign was crafted by a Pungeon Master
[1:48:21] <+brycart97> all the ones that cost 3 source are bad though FeelsBadMan @captainthunderwolf best one is overpower by far

[1:49:37] <+brycart97> utility is all that matters in this game @captainthunderwolf anything that gives mobility or things like chicken claw and chloroform are the best by far @captainthunderwolf
[1:49:41] <lewdskeletor13> Woolie is Punch Dad, Pat is Coward Dad

[1:50:47] <Etherealizer> THE BABY
[1:50:48] <%captainthunderwolf> @brycart97 I agree, yeah, Chloroform's mad busted and they front-load the early game skills way too much. Summoner does get MAD GOOD with enough investment, though.
[1:50:50] <Hiruzen93> HA HA
[1:50:53] <lloyddboy> the mask that lets you say the fantasy n-word

[1:51:23] <Zdawg39> you dont
[1:51:24] <HerrDemsus> wait
[1:51:24] <+brycart97> if i had to pick the best skill in the game its probably adrenaline @captainthunderwolf put that on every character LUL
[1:51:25] <+Shini6arcane> kitteh
[1:51:26] <%AncelDeLambert> THEN DON'T BE A SKELLY
[1:51:28] <+JenovasPuppet> You can have any helmet

[1:51:47] <studleydoorite> Squid1 jermaSlug meoww
[1:51:47] <+Flambage> @AngriestPat There are mods where you don't need the helmet
[1:51:50] <%laserbeaming> You can toggle visibility, but the helmet stays on

[1:53:18] <try_it_sis_> hold on
[1:53:18] <+brycart97> people think rogues are terrible in this game for some reason. but when you get 10 ap a turn you can backstab basically anything to death or at least CC range in 1 turn @captainthunderwolf
[1:53:21] <StubYourToe> we hold on better than pat
[1:53:22] <thedepreshun> Just tuning in
[1:53:22] <ZaWarudoHando> PREGNANT PROSTATE?!?!
[1:53:24] <+JoeStillLife> Pat has a plan
[1:53:25] <%captainthunderwolf> His urethra is so wide that the vacuum actually draws urine out of him, thus the constant pissing.
[1:53:26] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@Coystick)
[1:53:30] <thedepreshun> This is what I expected
[1:53:33] <vexicbayn> oh so ***
[1:53:37] <+JoeStillLife> Pat just needs you all to have some goddamn faith
[1:53:41] <%CJett92> Guys, just hold on
[1:53:45] <lewdskeletor13> We just need to have faith chat
[1:53:45] <%mostundesired> This screen should really say HOLD ON

[1:54:13] <+Xalgar> did the stream just start?
[1:54:14] <%mostundesired> @ssjklyco Hold on
[1:54:15] <%Dingus_Tickler> What is this new break song?
[1:54:16] <RCtiger0> I miss beneath the mask
[1:54:21] <%EvilWillYT> Sounds like Bit Trip Runner 2 music DansGame
[1:54:28] <+VanaSkiller> !uptime
[1:54:29] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 54m.
[1:54:30] <lewdskeletor13> @ssjklyco Oh boy, you missed A LOT
[1:54:33] <%captainthunderwolf> @brycart97 My main gripe is how fucking necessary the dual-wielded Daggers are. I really, really hate having skills bound to Daggers, which is why I get the mod to remove that requirement. Rogues are actually a lot of fun with Spears if you get that mod, which is good because Spears are fucking WORTHLESS otherwise.
[1:54:37] <tonytwotriez> i hate you all
[1:54:39] <Bailey__gaming> I can't sleep Insomnia is😐😨
[1:54:41] <+WhyIDie> baby bladder and humungurethra aren't a good combo
[1:54:45] <%0dokuro> apatMenace HoLD oN apatMenace
[1:54:54] <strangelee> I do find it odd that Ifan gets a Source Skill based on Summoning. I don't think I've ever built him to use it
[1:54:55] <+Xalgar> SourPls
[1:54:58] <%Dingus_Tickler> What is this new music?
[1:54:58] <+TheDude8D> tonight is just one big hold on
[1:55:02] <+TheDude8D> love it
[1:55:13] <%ssjklyco> @lewdskeletor13 yea, was at work. Saw something about a dead pixel and now im confused
[1:55:14] <lewdskeletor13> I love this dumb shitshow
[1:55:16] <%mostundesired> Crazy Talk Act 3: Hold On is too strong
[1:55:23] <thedepreshun> It's my birthday and this is the only way I can trick myself into feeling like I have friends
[1:55:28] <%Dingus_Tickler> @tonytwotriez Need a gift sub? atpLaw apatBlep
[1:55:28] <InsomniacPersona> @Dingus_Tickler new twitch rules to not use copyrighted music
[1:55:29] <Bailey__gaming> @umbypokochan you ok sir?
[1:55:33] <vexicbayn> we're 6 hours into stream and about 20 minutes into vidya
[1:55:37] <%mostundesired> Happy birthday
[1:55:37] <%captainthunderwolf> @strangelee Yeah, it's character fluff intruding too into character design IMO. It's a cool idea, but... just feels weird.
[1:55:37] <StubYourToe> Pat Stares At Toilet
[1:55:40] <vexicbayn> peak pat
[1:55:46] <+brycart97> its also dumb that dumping your points into warfare after 3 points in scoundrel is the optimum rogue build LUL @captainthunderwolf but that's just the case for anything that does physical damage. doesnt seem to make much sense
[1:55:46] <lewdskeletor13> @ssjklyco Pat had a neurotic breakdown and has switched games like 3 times
[1:55:50] <verelme> Is tonight the worst it has ever been?
[1:55:50] <+TheDude8D> depreshun me too but not my birthday
[1:55:50] <%Dingus_Tickler> @insomniacpersona DYAMMMNNNN
[1:55:53] <InsomniacPersona> basically to avoid problems
[1:55:54] <satyr_king> pat held that peepee now he have to peepee
[1:55:57] <+TheDude8D> it's the worst its ever been
[1:56:12] <%0dokuro> nerdrotic
[1:56:13] <%Dingus_Tickler> Time to play that fucking song everyone and their mom used in 2007
[1:56:20] <Huitzil37> dump your points into warframe?
[1:56:25] <%ssjklyco> @lewdskeletor13 that sounds like an entertaining VOD
[1:56:25] <vickee9192> I hate this song
[1:56:28] <TURBOSUPLEX3000> interesting timing to change break music away from Beneath The Mask
[1:56:30] <Bailey__gaming> pc gaming has these days where nothing wants to work
[1:56:30] <%Dingus_Tickler> brb gonna go google it real quick
[1:56:33] <+TheDude8D> today's sortie was awful
[1:56:33] <vexicbayn> how can anybody say that shit after shadow puzzles actually happrned for real in front of our human eyes
[1:56:35] <%0dokuro> noice
[1:56:37] <NeroInfinite> It's my birthday and pat had multiple panic attacks.
[1:56:37] <thedepreshun> Eyyyy
[1:56:38] <%mostundesired> It's just more piss
[1:56:40] <%RaikenTB> turn into Pat
[1:56:41] <+TheDude8D> that's just redbull in a glass!
[1:56:41] <%velemi> gross
[1:56:47] <%0dokuro> ahh...sure
[1:56:49] <NeroInfinite> It's the ebst birthday wish I could've asked for.
[1:56:51] <%lizard0tm> @AngriestPat you can toggle the helmet in the equip menu
[1:56:53] <%Faustgesicht> what the fuck happened now? i went to get chicken and steams back up good
[1:56:53] <foreverN2dust> You can toggle visibility.
[1:56:57] <+TheDude8D> you don't!
[1:56:57] <%crimsonharvest> helmet toggle in interface
[1:56:58] <%Xanderbats> Just hide the helmet
[1:57:00] <%velemi> Just turn off helmet visibility
[1:57:01] <%rdark_ksu> you can make it invisible
[1:57:01] <+Shini6arcane> dwnld a mod for it
[1:57:03] <+Bloodxb> just hide it
[1:57:07] <lewdskeletor13> Hold on chat
[1:57:07] <%captainthunderwolf> @brycart97 Yeah, Scoundrel mostly being a movement skill is completely backwards in a game with so many traversal options. And I also agree, the physical damage in this game feels weirdly balanced - either worthless, or OP. DOS2 is fun, but could really use a better gameplay designer.
[1:57:11] <%rdark_ksu> slot
[1:57:12] <%Xanderbats> You lose nothing
[1:57:12] <%velemi> equipment slot
[1:57:13] <+JenovasPuppet> @AngriestPat Normal helmets disguise you as well
[1:57:14] <+cgmerryo> you can wear a different helmet.
[1:57:16] <%crimsonharvest> you have other disguise methods too
[1:57:16] <LiquidMathew> Defense slot
[1:57:18] <strangelee> @captainthunderwolf any reccomended mods? I've always run with Free Pet Pal, Expanded Party, and that's about it
[1:57:19] <+TheDude8D> oh thats weird
[1:57:20] <MementoExtasis> i d k
[1:57:26] <+Bloodxb> you can wear normal helmets
[1:57:32] <verelme> All helms will conceal you
[1:57:43] <sirrice77> you can just wear normal helmets, even if they show your skelly face
[1:57:47] <%Rngiddion> there is no point
[1:57:48] <+Xanax44> The mask is good for species based skill checks
[1:57:48] <verelme> To change your race
[1:57:48] <+JenovasPuppet> Oh yeah, that's true. Just gets you different dialogue options.
[1:57:50] <+cgmerryo> if you wanna look like other people
[1:57:53] <Novillion> racial powers
[1:57:53] <TURBOSUPLEX3000> so you want fane to just be better than any other character?
[1:57:54] <%Dingus_Tickler> So if Pat can’t use Copyrighted Music anymore, he should use the “Dreamscape - 009 Sound System” song atpRtsd
[1:57:54] <%rdark_ksu> racial shit
[1:57:54] <pat_likes_to_sukadez_toes> @AngriestPat YEET YEET PAT LIKES FEET, BROS, HOES? HE SUCKA DEY TOES
[1:57:55] <Zdawg39> so you can have different dialogue
[1:57:57] <%AncelDeLambert> It gives you species skills
[1:57:58] <%Xanderbats> Dialog options
[1:57:58] <Nekros4442> The point of the face ripper is because there's some conversations locked by sex or race
[1:57:59] <+StrikeV3> racial dialog options?
[1:58:01] <TranquilTurnip> assume different personalites
[1:58:01] <+MisterCrimson> It rips faces and sounds metal as fuck
[1:58:02] <Zdawg39> cause some npc are racist
[1:58:02] <verelme> Different races have different abilities
[1:58:08] <%AbnormalVoid> yummerrs
[1:58:11] <couch_potato_Ed_Boy> Is P.P. a nick name for Pat and Paige?
[1:58:12] <A_mere_shrubb> I love this game dave50Good
[1:58:12] <Kaneis> The elves are racist against anyone but their own kind so it helps there
[1:58:12] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Tasty
[1:58:15] <verelme> You can be an elf and eat people to gain their powers and stuff
[1:58:15] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@danknugglit)
[1:58:16] <%moogleboy1984> You use the Mask of the Elf to eat corpses
[1:58:16] <Laycas49> That is 100% what it is for pat
[1:58:18] <+JenovasPuppet> Like some Elves won't even talk to you unless you're an elf.
[1:58:19] <%RantingRavager> nom nom nom
[1:58:20] <TURBOSUPLEX3000> species based race checks and combat abilities
[1:58:21] <%yoshkosh20> you also get species based perks
[1:58:21] <chancho4tierra> you can get skills by eating people
[1:58:22] <%AncelDeLambert> see, you now have the elf flesh eating skill
[1:58:25] <+brycart97> they should increase your crit multiplier by 6% so it'll be better than warfare as long as you're backstabbing but idk how much that would scale. maybe 5.5% or something. @captainthunderwolf
[1:58:25] <%laserbeaming> The mask gives you abilities from other races @AngriestPat like the ability of elves to know memories by eating flesh
[1:58:27] <%abadbadman> monkaS
[1:58:27] <+Flambage> @AngriestPat You gain the race abilities and persuasion checks
[1:58:31] <Novillion> you get the racial powers on top of fane shit
[1:58:31] <+Bloodxb> see
[1:58:35] <Bailey__gaming> He Enters you? lewd
[1:58:36] <sirrice77> @angriestpat as an elf you can eat people like they can
[1:58:37] <%abadbadman> apatLiz
[1:58:41] <%InsaneJackLondon> MMMMMMmM MEEEEEE
[1:58:46] <Bustahhwulf> Gachi has happened
[1:58:49] <chancho4tierra> eat people to get their skills
[1:58:50] <%SaltyDongs> Stab her
[1:58:52] <TranquilTurnip> I just got back, what Character did pat choose?
[1:58:55] <machshop> she done killed that man
[1:58:57] <$Yakobro> YO
[1:58:58] <pat_likes_to_sukadez_toes> @AngriestPat YEET YEET PAT LIKES FEET, BROS, HOES? HE SUCKA DEY TOES
[1:59:00] <%hawk_rush> Uh is this Omikron?
[1:59:07] <Your_Lost_Eraser> What did I miss?
[1:59:10] <%Will_The_Soulless> Is Paige okay?
[1:59:11] <%captainthunderwolf> @strangelee There's a mod that removes the Dagger requirement from Scoundrel skills, one that allows Revival scrolls to revive pets (Borderline needed for Sir Lora), and one that places respec mirrors in more locations throughout the game. I recommend all of those in addition to the ones you already have, just for quality-of-life improvements that sort of feel commonsense.
[1:59:12] <%Xanderbats> Gotta invest a point in scoundral to use it
[1:59:13] <%WheatlyXT> I'm having trouble getting the Pet Pal addon to work which one did you use pat?
[1:59:14] <%velemi> elves are cannibals
[1:59:17] <+brycart97> flesh sacrifice is op
[1:59:20] <Superblooms> you both aren't playing together?
[1:59:22] <DraxTD> OM NUM NUM
[1:59:23] <%mostundesired> Going down on girls must be awkward
[1:59:28] <+JacktheMan18> I wish i could learn bodily functions to use on command
[1:59:29] <%Shady_Zaku> ELVES?!
[1:59:32] <TURBOSUPLEX3000> the mask just gives you so many more options than other characters, especially since this game is loaded with racists
[1:59:34] <%0dokuro> super fun
[1:59:38] <sarg1010> You can't
[1:59:40] <Your_Lost_Eraser> LOOKS EPIC
[1:59:40] <+brycart97> you cant
[1:59:40] <lewdskeletor13> I forgot Paige was here, she scared me
[1:59:40] <pat_likes_to_sukadez_toes> @AngriestPat YEET YEET PAT LIKES FEET, BROS, HOES? HE SUCKA DEY TOES
[1:59:41] <%Xanderbats> You can't
[1:59:42] <%mostundesired> You can't
[1:59:42] <+Flambage> Cannibal Pat
[1:59:47] <strangelee> @AngriestPat you need a free slot but it will always go away
[1:59:48] <verelme> In the options, you can
[1:59:48] <%Big_Dream> cheats
[1:59:48] <sarg1010> you need to recast bull horns each time
[1:59:52] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 2 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 8oz (240mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[1:59:52] <TranquilTurnip> I just started this game for the first time today
[1:59:54] <%velemi> you can't, its like the biggest downside of polymorph
[1:59:54] <%hawk_rush> time for big cheats
[1:59:55] <+Ablestron> go to settings
[1:59:57] <verelme> set it to not remove stuff, at the bottom
[1:59:59] <DraxTD> you MOD it @AngriestPat
[2:00:01] <%0dokuro> Recast bull horns
[2:00:01] <%faegbeard> @AngriestPat You need to change something in the options, untick "remove unlearned skills" in the UI
[2:00:08] <%captainthunderwolf> @mostundesired An Elf literally licks your arm in this scene and knows what you were thinking last night. Elf sex is probably weird and makes it very hard to hide cheating.
[2:00:12] <+Ablestron> you can make it perminent in settings
[2:00:13] <+Flambage> @AngriestPat there is a polymoph mod to make them permanent
[2:00:14] <+Nomicro4u> hold on
[2:00:20] <%mostundesired> @captainthunderwolf I played this game but thanks
[2:00:23] <+PolarBearPat> you cant, but theres a mod to toggle polymorph things
[2:00:27] <%lizard0tm> automated hot bar is THE WORST
[2:00:27] <%ssjklyco> Hold On
[2:00:30] <TranquilTurnip> @AngriestPat have you ever played this before?
[2:00:32] <$Yakobro> HOLD ON
[2:00:34] <+Nomicro4u> Give Elmo some camera time
[2:00:36] <+Xalgar> Only point to Polymorph are Wings and Chicken Claw imo
[2:00:36] <%walternatorz> hold on
[2:00:38] <sarg1010> Are you playing on console?
[2:00:45] <CptBritches> We have now seen
[2:00:45] <+brycart97> chicken claw op
[2:00:47] <%velemi> oh shit! they actually made it not horrible!
[2:00:48] <emerald_poison> omfgafter all that I come back to divinity? alright whatever
[2:00:51] <%BlackJack607> I'm all in for the weird cannibal elf sex.
[2:00:53] <sarg1010> Ah fair enough. neat.
[2:00:55] <%captainthunderwolf> @mostundesired Alright? It's a missable dialogue interaction. You having played the game doesn't even guarantee that you saw it, my dawg.
[2:01:07] <Tomschiii> fcking christ, yakuzas combat is the fcking worst
[2:01:08] <jake1094> the ending was so underwhelming
[2:01:10] <pat_likes_to_sukadez_toes> @captainthunderwolf unless they polyamorous or practice free love
[2:01:13] <emerald_poison> Make sure to save scum the hell out of this
[2:01:13] <%mostundesired> @captainthunderwolf Now you're just being argumentative
[2:01:34] <%Xanderbats> Oh this is potentially the first time you're going to complete the game? Oh man Fane and Lohse are both a REALLY weird experience for someone completing the game for the first time.
[2:01:44] <Your_Lost_Eraser> PartyTime PartyTime PartyTime PartyTime PartyTime PartyTime
[2:01:52] <Rightyie> Lohse is my favorite MC
[2:02:00] <Gorgen> isnt the game like 100 hours long
[2:02:01] <%BlackJack607> Fane is my favorite MC
[2:02:04] <TranquilTurnip> @Xanderbats I just started my first run as Fane, was that a bad idea?
[2:02:06] <emerald_poison> why the hell are you not co-oping this with Paige!?
[2:02:09] <strangelee> I love Lohse, she's got such a good story
[2:02:10] <%BlackJack607> @Gorgen Try about 200 if you do everything
[2:02:10] <pat_likes_to_sukadez_toes> @AngriestPat YEET YEET PAT LIKES FEET, BROS, HOES? HE SUCKA DEY TOES
[2:02:13] <%velemi> allergical
[2:02:14] <emerald_poison> <message deleted>
[2:02:25] <%AbnormalVoid> de peeb
[2:02:27] <%mostundesired> God damn it I love Lohse so fucking much
[2:02:28] <%hawk_rush> @emerald_poison jesus, what did you say?
[2:02:28] <%NumbusPlays> oh boy, this is fun
[2:02:33] <%DONGWAVE> PoCKET SAND
[2:02:34] <%SaltyDongs> She's a gribble
[2:02:34] <%violetheart> @TranquilTurnip Nah, Fane's a neat way to start. An unusual one but not bad. Anyone's a fine start, premade, custom, or otherwise.
[2:02:38] <%Xanderbats> @TranquilTurnip there are just some story elements that change if you play as Fane or Lohse that change your perspective on story elements with other characters
[2:02:40] <%narusao> go on and git
[2:02:42] <%NumbusPlays> wait, are those *children* evil magicians?
[2:02:44] <emerald_poison> <3 just showing my passion
[2:02:46] <CptBritches> :)
[2:02:54] <Bouldus> low sa
[2:02:56] <%0dokuro> Fane is a little bit more lore central

[2:03:32] <CptBritches> I wish I was cool enough to be in a cool ship gang
[2:03:34] <CosmicKweeblo> Has Pat played this before?
[2:03:36] <DracaenaLeaf> That narrator makes me want to fall asleep
[2:03:37] <cordhine> I'm sure that won't be an important story element at all.
[2:03:39] <%Remery_> Challenge them to Basketball game :)

[2:12:03] <+Superkbrown95> how does one fuck a skeleton? does Paige have any input?
[2:12:04] <%DatLatinoGuy> dunno, Pat said it was the beginning of the second act
[2:12:04] <%mugwugsampoo> Yes Bloodborne is one of the best zouls
[2:12:11] <%DatLatinoGuy> so I imagine, yes?
[2:12:13] <grawlixman> yo, I got here from that tweet about the line, did he ever fix it?
[2:12:13] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> 2nd act may as well be half the game

[2:22:22] <xMorikunx> @ThatGuyfromMars pillars 2 isnt on switch, though?
[2:22:24] <%EvilWillYT> normal stealing is fine, stealing from the dead is a no no clearly

[2:50:10] <%LogothX> Mango
[2:50:15] <Miikaaeeel> Hell yeah mango
[2:50:16] <CaptainKarite> manga for sure
[2:50:18] <coldparty> Cats should be banned from streams.
[2:50:19] <%hawk_rush> mango for sure
[2:50:22] <%WIzardsOFTHEDEW> yellmo
[2:50:22] <%maskedriderhero> Always the manga, for any story ever
[2:50:25] <%hatesdps> phantom bloods just not a lot of fun save the start and end
[2:50:27] <%SulfurousAcid> watch 1 and 2, read the rest
[2:50:27] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> I liked it..
[2:50:31] <%mostundesired> To get into, anime is better. But I think manga is a better whole product.
[2:50:32] <%cherubsanonymous> Either is fine, honestly
[2:50:32] <Worldbrand> The adaptations are fine, so start with anime and then swap when you feel like it
[2:50:38] <zafooru> anime for sure
[2:50:38] <%0dokuro> 1, then read the manga
[2:50:42] <JSebz> part 2 anime is amazing tho
[2:50:43] <zafooru> SO NO CHI NO SADAME!
[2:50:43] <%JJCheeker> apatWink apatWink apatWink
[2:50:43] <dsauce999> ANEEM
[2:50:43] <%vVAstrAVv> best way to get into jojos is to SKIP phantom blood
[2:50:48] <%goodguydrew> jojo is garbo
[2:50:48] <silrhai> Anime is far superior
[2:50:49] <lewdskeletor13> Stream ending?
[2:50:52] <%maskedriderhero> Being an anime only is a sin against GOD
[2:50:52] <silrhai> You all know it's true
[2:50:56] <%hatesdps> watch the movies for part 1 my opinion matters
[2:50:56] <pillowwasp> The end of phantom blood is your first taste of real jojo
[2:50:57] <%cherubsanonymous> @vVAstrAVv D i e
[2:50:58] <lloyddboy> I'm trying to get my sis into jojo but Part 1 is a sloooooooooooooog
[2:51:04] <%galaxyswirl> I WOULD
[2:51:04] <%WIzardsOFTHEDEW> part 1 and 2 are really hard to read
[2:51:06] <DonatelloJose> Jojo part 3
[2:51:08] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> No one watched Pillars, people watched FF4
[2:51:09] <%DarkSodaMcFaceHead> Read the show
[2:51:16] <DonatelloJose> 4 is amazing
[2:51:18] <Worldbrand> skipping parts? eugh
[2:51:19] <lloyddboy> ME1 dlc
[2:51:19] <%Dr_DangerPhD> Steel Ball Run is the best tho just read that cuz its going to be years before that's even a possibility
[2:51:25] <%Shady_Zaku> YEA
[2:51:25] <%WIzardsOFTHEDEW> I would watch all the parts avaiable then if you really enjoy it read it over plus the rest
[2:51:26] <%vVAstrAVv> just look up the dio memes and start battle tendancy
[2:51:33] <$ooblagis> Pinnacle Station is the Mass Effect 1 DLC
[2:51:34] <%0dokuro> Pat is super right though, the anime adaption is superior
[2:51:34] <dsauce999> FREE MONES
[2:51:36] <%maskedriderhero> Never skip parts
