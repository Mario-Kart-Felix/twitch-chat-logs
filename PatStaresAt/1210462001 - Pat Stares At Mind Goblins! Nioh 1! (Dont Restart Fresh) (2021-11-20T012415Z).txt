[0:07:34] <+rafaelba93> after playimg 2 this looks tame

[0:07:41] <circular7> "how do I jump?"
[0:07:44] <%Psych_man13_13> you lock the good stuff
[0:07:52] <primaryfire> lock the ones you wanna keep, mark everything else to sell/disassemble/offer at shrine
[0:07:56] <%Bt_Robot> Is game sound weird for anyone else?
[0:07:58] <soggy_mess> Oh we're back?!

[0:08:16] <cartakus> Oh lord is he using heavy armour?
[0:08:24] <SunsetJack> @patstaresat If you want to se for Soul, go shrine. Blacksmith for money.
[0:08:25] <%studleydoorite> is this important or should pat just play?
[0:08:25] <Admiral_PopnFresh> welcome to Chugoku
[0:08:27] <Sonny_Firestorm> @PatStaresAt The armor you see in the bio (the canonical armor) is the Youngblood Set.
[0:08:28] <%BinaryFireball> what ... what is he trying to do?
[0:08:30] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Sell?????
[0:08:30] <theshillman> DISSASSEMBLE
[0:08:32] <%valriot> Dont sell, no point, just make it into EXP
[0:08:33] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Yess?
[0:08:37] <%BinaryFireball> were like 2min in and im already lost af
[0:08:38] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> press select
[0:08:40] <%RayReborne> you can select a bunch of items at once to sell/dismantle but theres no junk button
[0:08:40] <theshillman> DISASSEMBLE
[0:08:41] <oda_flobunaga> R2 Check all
[0:08:42] <$IzazaOzihaha> Mata doooozo
[0:08:42] <amiavamp> Frankly the most important thing is just making sure inventory is not full
[0:08:45] <primaryfire> at the shrine
[0:08:46] <Sonny_Firestorm> SHRINE
[0:08:47] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> give it to the shrine
[0:08:48] <Sonny_Firestorm> OFFER
[0:08:51] <%valriot> Donate to the Shrine
[0:08:51] <Bonebagmel> offer it at shrine to turn it into souls
[0:08:52] <EynoStiles> @patstaresat I feel like his goblin is totally valid
[0:08:53] <Profmcstevie> I do love when he says the word Sell 6 times
[0:08:54] <Admiral_PopnFresh> offer at shrine
[0:08:54] <SunsetJack> @patstaresat Go to Shrine instead of Blacksmith.
[0:08:55] <+DatAsuna> don't worry about it yet
[0:08:56] <%A_Mighty_Walrus> Yeah you offer them to the kodamas
[0:08:57] <%zeroarturia> uh oh
[0:08:57] <primaryfire> you can make an offering at the shrine to get souls instead
[0:08:58] <Cosairen> THIS IS GOING GREAT
[0:08:58] <+zanz_san> offer at the shrine
[0:08:58] <%Psych_man13_13> oh no
[0:08:59] <%Axellogic> Nah money and diassembling is more valuable then turning them in at the shrine
[0:08:59] <Admiral_PopnFresh> gives you Amrita
[0:09:01] <youngking_kush> At the Shrine
[0:09:01] <theshillman> oooof
[0:09:02] <+SiameseDuck> Disassemble mats are always needed and good
[0:09:06] <@Spydurman> pre show voer? time to go Kappa
[0:09:07] <%RayReborne> Offer to shrine yeah, but its so little Amrita/exp
[0:09:07] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> make offering
[0:09:09] <@Spydurman> over*
[0:09:10] <Albedo28> gotta offer stuff at the shrine like a good japanese white man
[0:09:11] <%Anthrozzz> i love this game
[0:09:13] <cartakus> This is going to be a great night
[0:09:17] <Admiral_PopnFresh> this is a Mind Goblin game, right?
[0:09:17] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt different places do different things, its confusing
[0:09:17] <SunsetJack> @patstaresat It would be offering to sell for exp.
[0:09:18] <+ElReaping> break things apart for mega crafting later to get big numbos
[0:09:23] <%shadowace2400> !uptime
[0:09:23] <@Moobot> @shadowace2400 I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 9m 38s.

[0:09:42] <youngking_kush> Make Offering
[0:09:44] <Treasure_Vault> Realign the scrimblo foreshortening
[0:09:45] <%SWFanatic> !raffle
[0:09:49] <Admiral_PopnFresh> many many many many many numbers
[0:09:52] <+theomnisoup> This is nioh, so all the numbers
[0:09:54] <Admiral_PopnFresh> !raffle
[0:09:56] <+DatAsuna> Honestly the only debuff worth a shit is slow
[0:10:02] <KaironFortressKnight> Oh lordy lord
[0:10:06] <primaryfire> I never sold or disassembled tbh, made plenty of money just running around but levels are always good and you get an elixir bonus from the shrine
[0:10:06] <NateyBeak> is the audio warblier than usual or am i nuts
[0:10:07] <Profmcstevie> scrimblio your bimblio from puerto rico
[0:10:11] <RubeTheRogue> What even IS the mind goblin that's being fought tonight?
[0:10:13] <SunsetJack> Save your points for now.
[0:10:13] <amiavamp> Omnyo is magic spells
[0:10:14] <Treasure_Vault> My favorite part about the dark souls games is the part where you swing your weapon at the monster.
[0:10:14] <+DatAsuna> Just buy a fire spell
[0:10:15] <Admiral_PopnFresh> This is amazing
[0:10:17] <%Axellogic> God the skill trees in nioh 1 are so shitty
[0:10:18] <%justcallmebobplease> YOU CAN DO IT PAT
[0:10:18] <youngking_kush> Shrine --> Make Offering
[0:10:21] <peanutdot007> You can trade them for poorly drawn monkeys.
[0:10:21] <radregice> LOL dont even worry about those right now
[0:10:22] <Sonny_Firestorm> Running Waters and Flux are the priority
[0:10:28] <%RealThiele> 5 samcoin buys like at least 2 jpegs
[0:10:29] <%SWFanatic> Download the genshin impact free to play currency in your Nioh Browser for extra Nimbambo
[0:10:31] <%Psych_man13_13> the only magic worth it is sloth and weak
[0:10:33] <%Broand> Did you invest in the green pagoda for the Hojo tribe?
[0:10:33] <+DatAsuna> the resistance talismans are junk
[0:10:34] <%Bluwizard21> Go for Sloth talismans
[0:10:38] <%valriot> Oh yeah this menu is ass compared to Nioh 2 lmao
[0:10:38] <+BedHome> why dont you just ignore this and play the game
[0:10:39] <+HuoShengdi> yeah nioh 2's skill trees are so much better
[0:10:39] <%A_Mighty_Walrus> man nioh 2 laid this out much better
[0:10:40] <%spitelite> remember guys its not that confusing
[0:10:40] <SunsetJack> You don't need anything for now.
[0:10:42] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> theres alot of good passive skills towards the bottom
[0:10:42] <+DatAsuna> sahdowround sucks
[0:10:45] <Admiral_PopnFresh> BREATH
[0:10:45] <radregice> LUL
[0:10:46] <amiavamp> go stick the pointy thing in the horny thing
[0:10:50] <%justcallmebobplease> YOU CAN DO IT
[0:10:55] <Zeif00> it begins
[0:10:57] <oda_flobunaga> Ignore
[0:10:57] <%CappuccinoGuil> Take it easy, breeeeath
[0:11:04] <Treasure_Vault> Double by twice half your 50% none extras
[0:11:07] <%BinaryFireball> ok whoever said this game wasnt complex is a fucking asshole
[0:11:07] <+DatAsuna> @valriot big disagree tbh, the sphere grid makes it so every level of every skill and every passive would overwhelm him at once lol
[0:11:08] <kikoeru_san> yeah that live action Bebop is not good
[0:11:11] <KaironFortressKnight> @amiavamp Now that's a Friday night
[0:11:12] <+DatAsuna> Instead of just a linear tree
[0:11:12] <%MooseIsGoose> Use your naruto jutsu knowledge
[0:11:13] <%valriot> Grab the Ki regen one
[0:11:16] <%RayReborne> its just stuff yeah
[0:11:16] <%Psych_man13_13> MAGIC SUCKS PAT
[0:11:16] <shiny_prinny> Talisman: Fire just throws fire on you weapon
[0:11:17] <%Bluwizard21> most of them are
[0:11:17] <stormhawk9891> @PatStaresAt Sloth talisman is the best one by far
[0:11:21] <Admiral_PopnFresh> yeah, Magic is not my thing
[0:11:21] <+DatAsuna> Most of them are garbage, that's true
[0:11:22] <$Futurecity10> @PatStaresAt From my limited knowledge the only good one is slow
[0:11:22] <Sonny_Firestorm> ***.A.TIME.
[0:11:22] <Treasure_Vault> @BinaryFireball This looks like a joke.
[0:11:23] <SunsetJack> Cause almost half are meh.
[0:11:25] <%justcallmebobplease> KI REGEN is great
[0:11:27] <+theomnisoup> Sloth is the best one
[0:11:28] <+DatAsuna> Just buy the attack ones
[0:11:28] <Albedo28> there's one that like increases your max ammo, but yeah, I ignored most
[0:11:30] <oda_flobunaga> Sloth
[0:11:31] <didgereedoodah> most of them are bad
[0:11:32] <Reveresao> I played this game a few years ago, dropped it due to boring areas and story.  Also, did not like the button tap Ki mechanic. I felt it was too much. I did like switching between the three stances, magic, and ninja weapons.
[0:11:32] <%Axellogic> Most magic in nioh 1 is about attack buff and enemy debuffs
[0:11:32] <+tetraes> isnt the slow talisman super busted?
[0:11:34] <@GeneralSCPatton> There are some general purpose ones that are great
[0:11:34] <SaltyAzteca> Sloth is the best one
[0:11:34] <%Bluwizard21> Sloth is insane
[0:11:35] <%MooseIsGoose> Magic does kinda stink in this one
[0:11:35] <%AlteisenReiseZ> PAT THERE'S ONE THERE'S AN AUTO REVIVE
[0:11:36] <amiavamp> Nioh really likes those 1% passives
[0:11:38] <+DatAsuna> Sloth is the only debuff worth a damn yeah
[0:11:40] <+SiameseDuck> They're all good but for SUPER specific builds. Otherwise they're mostly all garbage
[0:11:41] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> most of em are, sloth talisman is for cowards, right up your alley
[0:11:43] <$IzazaOzihaha> Sloth is broken
[0:11:44] <Sonny_Firestorm> Sloth = Training Wheels, take it.
[0:11:45] <kikoeru_san> Just get a elemental buff for your sword and move on
[0:11:46] <youngking_kush> @patstaresat Just find the Sloth Talisman
[0:11:47] <theshillman> the ones that give your weapons elemental damage are super good to have
[0:11:47] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt second that advice
[0:11:48] <%Piemono> I just used ninjitsu to throw things at guys until they died
[0:11:51] <+DatAsuna> Other than that, you just buy "fire ball" and "water projectile"
[0:11:54] <%BinaryFireball> @Treasure_Vault I walked away for 10 seconds and came back to menu hell
[0:11:55] <primaryfire> there's a couple good passives hidden in onmyo and ninjutsu
[0:12:01] <shiny_prinny> lifeSEAL
[0:12:02] <%Axellogic> @AlteisenReiseZ thats a ninja
[0:12:02] <MicrotonalMatt> All I did was use the bombs or sticky white stuff one and that’s it I think
[0:12:03] <Hamborgini> lifeSEAL
[0:12:03] <+zanz_san> seal
[0:12:04] <LVL1_Scumbag> Because it's life SEAL
[0:12:04] <+DatAsuna> it says seal not steal
[0:12:04] <%Cozy90> Pat just enable the scrimblo particle factor
[0:12:05] <%RayReborne> life SEAL not steal
[0:12:05] <Albedo28> throwing stars
[0:12:06] <%valriot> Thats because it says LifeSEAL
[0:12:07] <%Psych_man13_13> NINJA ALSO SUCKS
[0:12:09] <oda_flobunaga> seal not steal
[0:12:10] <kikoeru_san> ninja is bomb
[0:12:13] <OverzealousEuthanasiast> life-takesies
[0:12:14] <+zanz_san> resurrection
[0:12:14] <%SWFanatic> Goose Attack
[0:12:16] <$grotto_kein> Orcle give enemy and item radar
[0:12:19] <cartakus> Should you not be learning the combat first?
[0:12:23] <%Piemono> Ninja is great
[0:12:25] <+DatAsuna> Ninja sucks until it gets OP< but that's onyl at endgame lol
[0:12:25] <Admiral_PopnFresh> A lot of Ninja stuff is infinite Items
[0:12:25] <amiavamp> Ninja is suck unless you spec specifically into consumables
[0:12:26] <theshillman> Please Pat get the onmyo that make your weapons do elemental damage
[0:12:28] <%AlteisenReiseZ> PAT, NINJA IS FOR REVIVE
[0:12:31] <%MooseIsGoose> isn't this fun
[0:12:32] <amiavamp> Ninja is ultimate goblins
[0:12:33] <Admiral_PopnFresh> like caltrops and shuriken
[0:12:33] <%Axellogic> Honestly the ninja and omyo is a lot to take in id just hit enemies with odachi and axe
[0:12:35] <soflicar> its only confusing if you can't read
[0:12:40] <didgereedoodah> don't worry about it yet
[0:12:41] <%SWFanatic> Menu Navigation: THE GAME
[0:12:42] <%SwipperSwapper> is this game just menus
[0:12:47] <+Asi9> man, I forgot how front loaded and complicated Nioh is
[0:12:49] <+SiameseDuck> Yeah! We're in it now!
[0:12:49] <SaltyAzteca> Keep Kodama on elixer, thats all you need
[0:12:49] <+DatAsuna> If you're like lvl 100 ninjutsu is strong if you're lvl 20 it sucks
[0:12:55] <%BinaryFireball> so what build is he doing?
[0:12:55] <BigFingerRo> Jutsus? It's pronounced JATZ pat
[0:12:56] <%BinaryFireball> I guess
[0:12:58] <+tempestzephyr> You too can be in Fortnite
[0:13:04] <%Axellogic> Once ready you can equip to your hotbar
[0:13:08] <+Local16> Originally I thought pat was starting over and then trying not to quit
[0:13:08] <Albedo28> now its like an estus, regens uses at shrines
[0:13:10] <Admiral_PopnFresh> he's so lost and I love
[0:13:11] <$IzazaOzihaha> I find the menus relaxing after the gameplay.
[0:13:11] <Sonny_Firestorm> It's anxiety inducing not to be able to comunicate with Pat directly.
[0:13:13] <Admiral_PopnFresh> it
[0:13:15] <%valriot> Same as DS, you have "atunemeent space"
[0:13:15] <theshillman> It is now an Item that you get back every time you bonfire
[0:13:15] <%MooseIsGoose> it adds it as an item in your inventory that restocks if you rest at a shrine
[0:13:17] <%Psych_man13_13> Magic is like estus
[0:13:26] <primaryfire> there's a ninjutsu skill that lets you carry more estus btw
[0:13:36] <cartakus> Oh god...I wonder if it went like this for me 2 to 3 years ago
[0:13:37] <+DatAsuna> The mine sucks yeah
[0:13:39] <%MooseIsGoose> the mine stinks
[0:13:41] <%SWFanatic> I remember Hate
[0:13:42] <%valriot> OH MAN THIS MAIN MISSION SUCKS TO START BACK ON LUL
[0:13:43] <+EthorXL> EthorXL subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 9 months! Pat, you going to do a nuzlocke for the next Mind Goblins?
[0:13:43] <Sonny_Firestorm> @PatStaresAt Maybe you should go warm-up in the Dojo? you sound like you need it
[0:13:44] <Admiral_PopnFresh> mine isn't great, Centipede sucks
[0:13:45] <SaltyAzteca> That was the giant caterpillar I think?
[0:13:46] <%Psych_man13_13> that mission does suck
[0:13:49] <+DatAsuna> You're about to go into another lowpoint of the game too
[0:13:50] <knight_verse> This games are like Monster Hunter where you need to learn menu hunting first.
[0:13:51] <oda_flobunaga> It sucks yeah
[0:13:53] <%cvp5127> the fart mines
[0:13:53] <shiny_prinny> this Region specifically is painful
[0:13:54] <amiavamp> Is the silver mine the one with the centipede boss? That thing bugged out on me and turned invisible
[0:13:57] <%AlteisenReiseZ> That sub-mission gets you 2 new spirits
[0:14:02] <didgereedoodah> Centipede is the worst boss in the whole series
[0:14:03] <Hamborgini> the centipede is the worst boss in the game, but now you don't have to worry about it
[0:14:05] <SunsetJack> Oh god, ocean road is bleh.
[0:14:11] <+DatAsuna> Most spirits suck
[0:14:12] <Admiral_PopnFresh> different buffs
[0:14:13] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Playstyle
[0:14:15] <%Axellogic> Spirits have different passive stats
[0:14:20] <@Lion_kun> It's amazing how even though Nioh 2 reuses a lot of things from Nioh 1, a few small changes made a massive difference and made me love the game so much more.
[0:14:21] <cartakus> MOEE NUMBERS
[0:14:21] <%Psych_man13_13> you can have multiple later
[0:14:22] <+DatAsuna> Only like 4-5 spirits are good
[0:14:25] <SaltyAzteca> YEYEYEYE ODACHI BOYS
[0:14:26] <Albedo28> there's a bull that gives you life on kill or something
[0:14:27] <%Nordguy> I liked this level
[0:14:27] <+DatAsuna> and they're very good
[0:14:29] <%RayReborne> Buffs man. plus special invinsible mode
[0:14:30] <%SWFanatic> Shine Sparkuh
[0:14:31] <%BinaryFireball> big sword big
[0:14:31] <$IzazaOzihaha> Centipede is the worst? Y'all are nuts.
[0:14:34] <amiavamp> In Nioh 2 the spirits are even dumber because your parry is tied to them, so your choices are more limited based on what parry you like
[0:14:36] <primaryfire> some of the new spirits have crazy shit like health regen when you absorb souls or saving you from a lethal hit
[0:14:36] <%BinaryFireball> i like big sword
[0:14:37] <Cosairen> different passives and actives
[0:14:38] <%Axellogic> Honestly Id just stick with the fire dog for the general use it offers
[0:14:38] <+SiameseDuck> The default dog spirit is a really good spirit for a long time you won't need to change
[0:14:39] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Odachi objectively best weapon
[0:14:42] <+zanz_san> they are play style specifically
[0:14:43] <MicrotonalMatt> There’s so many number things all of the numbers are like no number
[0:14:47] <srv4254> fire pupper is good for stamina i think
[0:14:47] <Sonny_Firestorm> No bad spirits, only bad users.
[0:14:48] <amiavamp> Why is the sound super compressed and loud?
[0:14:49] <cartakus> Hey big ass sword nice
[0:14:50] <oda_flobunaga> Maria of the Tiny Fuck Room is the worst
[0:14:51] <SunsetJack> Dog is fine if you just want to play.
[0:14:53] <+DatAsuna> centipede isn't the worst but the mines are generally a boring stage
[0:15:02] <Sonny_Firestorm> @Admiral_PopnFresh Oh yeah, where's your stamina. LUL
[0:15:08] <+DatAsuna> Maria sucks because she has like 3 moves
[0:15:09] <+theomnisoup> @Admiral_PopnFresh but FISTS tho
[0:15:10] <@Lion_kun> In Nioh 2, you dump guardian spirits and get specific yokai forms with clear distinct strengths and weaknesses. Also you get yokai abilities you can slot in like it's Aria of Sorrow.
[0:15:22] <%SWFanatic> psaHoldon
[0:15:28] <SunsetJack> Hold LB
[0:15:31] <%valriot> R1 dpad
[0:15:32] <%RayReborne> hold R1 dpad
[0:15:39] <+DatAsuna> Except you also have guardian spirits in nioh 2 still
[0:15:39] <primaryfire> hold R1 + up or down
[0:15:40] <SunsetJack> L1
[0:15:41] <%A_Mighty_Walrus> hold stance and use d pad
[0:15:44] <Admiral_PopnFresh> @Sonny_Firestorm who needs stamina when big hit, also Ki pulse, Ki pulse, Ki pulse
[0:15:44] <amiavamp> Hold R1 for stances and item changes
[0:15:47] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt R1 and down
[0:15:47] <primaryfire> sorry, left or right
[0:15:47] <%Broand> Spirits are basically big equipment, some will benefit certain builds more than others. Like the bat spirit which gives ninja tools a chance to not be used
[0:15:51] <SunsetJack> Sorry
[0:16:02] <cartakus> You know I'm happy for the tutorial area in nioh 2
[0:16:04] <@Lion_kun> I made an immortal build in Nioh 2 where I regained health from hits and used Tonfa, I was a beast. Steamrolled the main game and most of the dlcs.
[0:16:08] <%Axellogic> High Stance strong attack on Axe can solve most problems
[0:16:08] <%Djinnazz> D pad
[0:16:08] <%chiazam> Wow this game looks good
[0:16:08] <+DatAsuna> And the yokai abilities add an extra level of loot management to filter through with a ton of junk cores lmao
[0:16:11] <MyNameIsRasus> is that a mochi hammer
[0:16:13] <Sonny_Firestorm> @Admiral_PopnFresh Play the game on Demon or higher than tell me that. LUL
[0:16:30] <%Psych_man13_13> Pro tip, only use Odachi
[0:16:31] <%SWFanatic> Jack Skellington
[0:16:45] <+alaric728> Oh boy does twitch's compression hate Nioh
[0:16:54] <+TopTieramisu> don't forget ki recovery
[0:16:55] <+theomnisoup> Man trying to remember how to play Nioh after going on hiatus is the TRUE nioh experience
[0:16:59] <%RayReborne> Glory!
[0:17:01] <SaltyAzteca> Dont forget to switch stances
[0:17:02] <+DatAsuna> yes
[0:17:03] <amiavamp> With Odachi you can afford to play aggressive, you can beat on their guard and drain their stamina
[0:17:04] <cartakus> yay you did it!
[0:17:07] <SunsetJack> Sub mission
[0:17:07] <%valriot> Low stance best for evasion btw, since it uses less stamina
[0:17:08] <+DatAsuna> Sidequests reuse old areas
[0:17:08] <pixelkenj> Missions reuse maps
[0:17:08] <$IzazaOzihaha> You seem to be ki pulsing too soon.
[0:17:14] <MyNameIsRasus> you are the old area
[0:17:18] <%Broand> This is a side mission in an area you cleared already
[0:17:18] <%MooseIsGoose> sub missions take place in past areas normally
[0:17:20] <@Lion_kun> Elixirs stock will go down unless you find all the kodama in the region.
[0:17:21] <%Axellogic> The shrines not representative of your kodama
[0:17:23] <+TopTieramisu> low stance is for cowards
[0:17:24] <%SWFanatic> Push the X X X and the Y Y Y to Pray
[0:17:26] <+zanz_san> side mission reuse maps
[0:17:26] <%RayReborne> They count for the REGION pat, they carry over through levels
[0:17:27] <didgereedoodah> it's per region not mission
[0:17:30] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt side Missions reuse old areas
[0:17:34] <%MooseIsGoose> it is
[0:17:35] <MicrotonalMatt> Kodama carry between maps in the same reguon
[0:17:36] <+PMAvers> The little dudes are region specific I think.
[0:17:38] <%Bluwizard21> I hate this map area, they use it so fucking much even in the second one
[0:17:38] <amiavamp> Nioh 2 has spells with a mana bar
[0:17:39] <$Futurecity10> demon parry and form
[0:17:41] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Because it looks nicer Kappa
[0:17:43] <shiny_prinny> New layer to combat with Yokai Abilities
[0:17:43] <+zanz_san> Assist attacks
[0:17:44] <+TopTieramisu> nioh 2 has that counter move
[0:17:44] <@Lion_kun> Nioh 2 gives you yokai abiltiies like it;s aria of sorrow.
[0:17:45] <+SilverDevilfish> Better everything
[0:17:45] <%Saadi90> every way
[0:17:46] <+theomnisoup> Many QOL changes
[0:17:46] <%Axellogic> The UI and descriptions is alot easier to understand in 2
[0:17:46] <%Piemono> Kodama sitck with you through regions
[0:17:47] <%GhoulishCripple> it makes the skills a lot more readable and adds some cool shit
[0:17:48] <Bonebagmel> Nioh 2 is vastly simplified, but still has everything from 1
[0:17:49] <%Speed1ines> Nioh 2 has an active parry system
[0:17:50] <shiny_prinny> QOL updates
[0:17:50] <%RayReborne> Quality of life improvement plus new gameplay mechanics and weapon types
[0:17:50] <pixelkenj> Devil Trigger?
[0:17:51] <%slrls_> You have more tools to handle the bullshit. No more relying on living weapon.
[0:17:52] <+zanz_san> Demon parry
[0:17:53] <Sonny_Firestorm> @PatStaresAt Crapton of updates and optimization. (also more weapons)
[0:17:53] <+DatAsuna> Not every way
[0:17:54] <%valriot> Skill trees, stat system, skill point based on USE, rather than stat
[0:17:56] <%Tarage> Eyyy it's a Paaaaaaaaat
[0:17:56] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Sub missions are tiny in comparison and to mains, and reuse the same maps
[0:17:57] <fimbulvetr27> That's a pretty exhaustive list, to be honest
[0:17:57] <$IzazaOzihaha> Better optimized interface, burst counter
[0:17:58] <+DatAsuna> It adds more weapons and mechanics
[0:18:00] <+ElReaping> because there's more menus ;)
[0:18:00] <stormhawk9891> General QoL changes
[0:18:00] <gnarly_memes_bro> @patstaresat you get enemy abilities
[0:18:00] <@Lion_kun> Also instead of guardian spirits, you get yokai forms with specific counters which is much more fun.
[0:18:01] <@GeneralSCPatton> YOKAI TRIGGER
[0:18:04] <%MooseIsGoose> A lot of the sprit and magic stuff is better and better things in it
[0:18:05] <%valriot> More weapon, the yokai moves ect
[0:18:05] <+DatAsuna> And it lets you fight a lot of Nioh 1 bosses
[0:18:05] <amiavamp> Also new weapons are good
[0:18:07] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> secrect techiniques
[0:18:07] <+McSoliace> its just a straight upgrade pretty much
[0:18:08] <cartakus> People had the experience of nioh 1 going into 2 so...
[0:18:09] <SainEdge> i didnt think it would be true, but nioh 2 has so many small changes and additions, it really is a better game
[0:18:11] <%A_Mighty_Walrus> you get the aria of sorrow enemy powers, a DT, the switch glaive and the skills menu is much better
[0:18:14] <%AHomeschoolDropout> Basically improves and greatly simplifies unnecessarily complex aspects of the game as well as new abilities
[0:18:16] <+Local16> @PatStaresAt All the skills have vids to show you what they're for. The menu is also way easier to navigate.
[0:18:21] <@Lion_kun> The yokai burst mechanic alone is a huge improvement.
[0:18:23] <amiavamp> The stone samurai are the worst kind of soulslike enemy
[0:18:24] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt Looks nices, Skill progression menues make sense, more mechanical deapth, more enemy variety, no shitty bosses, better level design, etc.
[0:18:28] <Admiral_PopnFresh> !
[0:18:31] <+DatAsuna> @SainEdge A better game, but not a pure replacement game imho
[0:18:32] <%Tarage> GOBLINS
[0:18:32] <T_Sasquatch> I was able to beat the first boss of Nioh 2 so its better Kappa
[0:18:32] <%MooseIsGoose> lol
[0:18:32] <%ConLin_Arts_> NotLikeThis
[0:18:32] <%Djinnazz> It’s all this stuff. Plus MORe stuff
[0:18:33] <didgereedoodah> more enemy variety, yokai abilities, better menues
[0:18:33] <+TopTieramisu> mind goblins
[0:18:37] <Cosairen> were odachi in base game or added in dlc i dont remember them
[0:18:39] <shiny_prinny> this is one of those mini goblins
[0:18:41] <NateyBeak> LEAVE IT UP
[0:18:42] <%Broand> Goblinos
[0:18:44] <%MechArch> you gonna learn today
[0:18:45] <%greasypete00> what's the mind gobliny aspect of nioh that's he's going against?
[0:18:46] <%Saadi90> parry, pokemon, character creator, devil trigger, cool new weapons
[0:18:47] <amiavamp> Odachi was DLC
[0:18:48] <Admiral_PopnFresh> remove ALL exclamation points
[0:18:48] <+rafaelba93> KILL THE GOBLIN
[0:18:49] <Sonny_Firestorm> YOU CAN RESPEC THIS ISN"T SOULS
[0:18:53] <%RayReborne> need to progress through story
[0:18:53] <MicrotonalMatt> The goblin horde
[0:18:54] <%valriot> Pat its just a skill point
[0:18:55] <%Axellogic> YOu are locked from learning some skills til you do Dojo Missions
[0:18:55] <+DatAsuna> Some skills cost more than 1 point and it's better to wait for those than buy junk just cause it's cheap
[0:18:55] <stormhawk9891> @Cosairen DLC
[0:18:56] <KaironFortressKnight> Guys, he's playing Nioh. MIND ONI
[0:18:57] <$IzazaOzihaha> Also when you die to a boss in Nioh 2 and you return to the boss arena, your amrita automatically returns to you.
[0:18:59] <%Bt_Robot> LEAVE IT PAT
[0:19:02] <%Tarage> JAPANESE GOBLINS
[0:19:02] <SunsetJack> Save your points. You have to progress to learn get more.
[0:19:02] <%GhoulishCripple> level 1 leave the point. you need multiple points for higher levels @patstaresat
[0:19:06] <+TopTieramisu> enemy variety is a big thing. nioh 1 reuses enemies too much
[0:19:08] <primaryfire> nioh 2 has more weapons, more moveset variance, more enemy variety, more music,a slightly better story, unique ki pulse buffs from each stance, yokai abilities etc
[0:19:22] <amiavamp> Nioh 2 has a story?
[0:19:22] <MicrotonalMatt> Mind yokai
[0:19:24] <%Broand> Brain bakemono
[0:19:25] <SaltyAzteca> There are traps here, be careful
[0:19:28] <%RayReborne> Water
[0:19:29] <+TopTieramisu> nioh 2 has character creator and not generic man
[0:19:33] <+DatAsuna> Id disagree that nioh 2's story is better lmao
[0:19:35] <+SiameseDuck> It's on water!
[0:19:35] <@GeneralSCPatton> It's on water
[0:19:37] <amiavamp> I thought it was excerpts from an embellished textbook
[0:19:39] <Sonny_Firestorm> your sword is on water actually LUL
[0:19:40] <%Axellogic> Blue is water, water is a defense debuff on enemies
[0:19:42] <SaltyAzteca> @amiavamp forgettable story, but still fun
[0:19:43] <+tempestzephyr> on anti fire
[0:19:46] <%JoshManVGH> Isn't your sword on water?
[0:19:46] <Cosairen> welcome to sens fortress of nioh
[0:19:48] <SaltyAzteca> Just like Nioh 1
[0:19:49] <+DatAsuna> Nioh 2's story is even worse than the low bar of 1, partly because of the silent protag
[0:19:51] <%SWFanatic> You gotta know when to hold em and you gotta know when to yokaii
[0:19:51] <gnarly_memes_bro> yeah its cool I'm going through the dlcs for 2 now and they're great so far
[0:19:52] <%Tarage> Become as Goblins
[0:19:53] <Albedo28> killing those floating heads give you element effect basically
[0:19:54] <primaryfire> I like the nioh 1 story but I think the beats are more engaging in 2
[0:19:59] <Ris_Eltrut> MOIST sword
[0:20:00] <didgereedoodah> Nioh 2 story is worse
[0:20:06] <+Asi9> Did they get rid of ki pulse in 2? I never liked that mechanic.
[0:20:07] <SunsetJack> @patstaresat Map shows objective. This mission has 3 spots to go.
[0:20:08] <Profmcstevie> Murder is in the muscles, not the mind
[0:20:09] <+DatAsuna> But also because it lacks anything on the level of the nobunaga twist or yasuke
[0:20:09] <%GhoulishCripple> @amiavamp it's kinda that. you play as an embellished Japanese history man
[0:20:11] <+ashunite> Nioh 1 sometimes just looks like those fake games they play in TV shows.
[0:20:13] <pixelkenj> odachi is so good in nioh 1
[0:20:19] <+TopTieramisu> nioh's story has always been ResidentSleeper
[0:20:25] <%octavian_wolf> Ki pulse stays
[0:20:26] <%JoshManVGH> You're doing it pat!
[0:20:27] <amiavamp> Odachi is good in both
[0:20:31] <%RayReborne> its good just other stuff is better
[0:20:32] <shiny_prinny> it's still fine in Nioh 2
[0:20:32] <SaltyAzteca> Its just as good in nioh 2
[0:20:32] <%valriot> Odachi is good in Nioh 1
[0:20:32] <%JoshManVGH> Got some nerfs
[0:20:33] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> whoever said that is wrong
[0:20:34] <Hamborgini> it is also good in nioh 2
[0:20:34] <%Axellogic> Its still good in 2
[0:20:34] <@Lion_kun> It's good in both.
[0:20:35] <@GeneralSCPatton> It's still great
[0:20:37] <+theomnisoup> @Asi9 lmao no its a core mechanic
[0:20:40] <oda_flobunaga> Both games have good stories but neither tell them well
[0:20:40] <+TopTieramisu> another oda nobunaga jerkfest
[0:20:41] <%MooseIsGoose> I think the spear is the best due to its reach and speed
[0:20:42] <%valriot> All the weapons are just better in 2
[0:20:44] <+McSoliace> there are just cooler weapons in 2
[0:20:44] <SunsetJack> @patstaresat Living weapon (DT) is X+O.
[0:20:46] <oda_flobunaga> Its still great
[0:20:47] <+DatAsuna> Nioh 1 is a meh story with 2-3 popoffs that are hype. Nioh 2 is just a meh story with no pop offs
[0:20:47] <didgereedoodah> I thought it was better in 2
[0:20:49] <cartakus> The story of the dlc in 2 is way worse than the dlc's in 1
[0:20:55] <gnarly_memes_bro> everything else got better so the gap isn't as big
[0:20:59] <%Dapper_Cactuar> weapon balance is a lot better in Nioh 2
[0:21:01] <%Saadi90> Nioh 2 has a lot more cooler weapons
[0:21:02] <%valriot> BTW, this is the ONLY enemy that didnt come back to Nioh 2 LUL LUL
[0:21:04] <@Lion_kun> Tonfas are really great.
[0:21:10] <$IzazaOzihaha> Are we allowed to backseat about the statues?
[0:21:13] <@Lion_kun> They have such good dps.
[0:21:13] <amiavamp> Get used to keeping your health full because most enemies are going to drop you in 2-3 hits
[0:21:15] <+DatAsuna> @cartakus And honestly the DLC in 1 ends on a wet fart too
[0:21:15] <pixelkenj> GOBLIN DETECTED?
[0:21:32] <%RayReborne> NO PURPLE GOOD
[0:21:35] <%MooseIsGoose> the sword may be better
[0:21:39] <SaltyAzteca> Destroy garbage get souls
[0:21:42] <SunsetJack> Garbage is exp technically.
[0:21:43] <Albedo28> big goblin
[0:21:44] <@GeneralSCPatton> Living Weapon is just a big buff with INVULN. I used it to cheese the no-damage boss challenges.
[0:21:44] <cartakus> Yup the tengu one just ends
[0:21:45] <%SWFanatic> You didn't win, I don't even care!
[0:21:46] <theshillman> why not use living weapon? it's free buffs
[0:21:47] <%RayReborne> Purple weapon i meant
[0:21:48] <T_Sasquatch> Has pat lost a mind Goblin stream yet
[0:21:53] <+tempestzephyr> But you Love Garbage :)
[0:21:53] <SaltyAzteca> You need to level it up
[0:21:53] <Sonny_Firestorm> PURPLE = Highest Rarity available for you
[0:21:54] <%RayReborne> oh yeah ok
[0:21:54] <%MooseIsGoose> but if you use it then it get better
[0:21:58] <%valriot> Its good, your Familiarity is low
[0:22:02] <%Axellogic> Your weapon has more familiarity, that increases its damage
[0:22:02] <Albedo28> itll do more once you get familiar with it
[0:22:03] <@Lion_kun> But it is rarer.
[0:22:03] <Hamborgini> familiarity go up, number go up
[0:22:04] <theshillman> because familiarity low
[0:22:04] <%SmiteKnight> Familiarity
[0:22:04] <%Tarage> NUMBER GO DOWN
[0:22:04] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> good for deconstructing then
[0:22:05] <%octavian_wolf> he's gonna lose this one lmao
[0:22:06] <SaltyAzteca> Level up the familiarity
[0:22:07] <Albedo28> that bar increases stats
[0:22:08] <%Dapper_Cactuar> familiarity increases damage the more you use it
[0:22:09] <KaironFortressKnight> But damage goes higher with familiarity
[0:22:09] <%SmiteKnight> The more you use it, the better it gets.
[0:22:11] <@Lion_kun> If you use it, it gets better.
[0:22:11] <%SmiteKnight> Number go up
[0:22:12] <stormhawk9891> @PatStaresAt Familiarty boosts stats
[0:22:12] <KaironFortressKnight> more use basically
[0:22:13] <%A_Mighty_Walrus> use sword and number go up
[0:22:14] <robert_orri> it gains attack with familiarity
[0:22:14] <+DatAsuna> familiarity buffs weapon damage
[0:22:15] <%CappuccinoGuil> familiarity increases damage
[0:22:15] <%SmiteKnight> WETSTONE
[0:22:15] <+SiameseDuck> Increase familiarity and the damage will go up
[0:22:15] <fimbulvetr27> Familiarity boosts damage
[0:22:15] <%MooseIsGoose> The more you use a weapon the better it gets
[0:22:15] <theshillman> familiarity go up, number go up
[0:22:16] <radregice> lol
[0:22:16] <Hamborgini> use weapon, number go up
[0:22:17] <%Axellogic> ONce the purple gets used itll be stronger
[0:22:17] <gnarly_memes_bro> it will get better as you use it
[0:22:19] <%RayReborne> oh yeah familiarlity (just use it a bunch) will beef the power
[0:22:19] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> weapons get stronger the more you use them, thats familiarity
[0:22:19] <+McSoliace> pat brain oh no
[0:22:20] <%GhoulishCripple> using a weapon makes it stronger
[0:22:20] <$IzazaOzihaha> The DLC in Nioh 1 ends on the best boss in the game, but okay.
[0:22:20] <@Lion_kun> Also it has better special effects.
[0:22:21] <didgereedoodah> ignore rarity it doesn't matter
[0:22:21] <cartakus> The blue bar will increase the damage
[0:22:24] <%Piemono> The more you use a weapon the better it gets
[0:22:25] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt It will do more damage if you use it and level its familiarity
[0:22:25] <@Lion_kun> No way to tell.
[0:22:25] <Profmcstevie> It's SLIGHTLY weaker with less "weapon exp" Pat
[0:22:27] <SaltyAzteca> More than what youre using
[0:22:27] <+SiameseDuck> Probably over 300
[0:22:27] <Sonny_Firestorm> a bit over 300
[0:22:28] <%valriot> Its like a solid 5-10% increase
[0:22:29] <+JustToWatch> more
[0:22:30] <%RayReborne> more than your current one for sure
[0:22:30] <stormhawk9891> bigger
[0:22:31] <pixelkenj> Find out
[0:22:32] <+theomnisoup> Higher than yellow
[0:22:33] <@Lion_kun> But it will be better.
[0:22:34] <amiavamp> Weapon level
[0:22:35] <%Axellogic> Prolly around 10-20 higher
[0:22:39] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Check Item Level
[0:22:39] <%Tarage> BIG NUMBER
[0:22:39] <gnarly_memes_bro> you don't
[0:22:39] <pixelkenj> Purple has better scaling
[0:22:39] <T_Sasquatch> Oh boy heree we go
[0:22:40] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt above 300
[0:22:40] <%MooseIsGoose> because of how close it is to it
[0:22:40] <@Lion_kun> Because at abse, it's almsot as good.
[0:22:40] <cartakus> It will just be better
[0:22:41] <Admiral_PopnFresh> you don't experiment
[0:22:42] <%SmiteKnight> It's pretty close to what you have now.
[0:22:42] <Hamborgini> higher rarity
[0:22:43] <+DatAsuna> You look at the base level
[0:22:43] <%AHomeschoolDropout> More Familiarity will ALWAYS be better
[0:22:43] <@Lion_kun> base*
[0:22:46] <KaironFortressKnight> level and rarity
[0:22:47] <%valriot> Cos i played it more than you
[0:22:48] <%slrls_> the base familiarity is at your current weapon at peak familiarity
[0:22:49] <%SmiteKnight> It goes up by at least 20 points.
[0:22:49] <+theomnisoup> bigger bar
[0:22:49] <Albedo28> 4 steps, might be like 12 per step or better depending on bonus. That one is a C bonus so its not huge
[0:22:51] <SunsetJack> It will get better when you max it out.
[0:22:52] <%Axellogic> Each Familiarity pip increases the damage
[0:22:53] <Albedo28> still will add up
[0:22:55] <amiavamp> Top right
[0:22:58] <%GhoulishCripple> bigger the bar the more the damage increases
[0:22:58] <+metalicblackcherry> upper left
[0:22:58] <+ReallyBigRocks> above the picture
[0:22:58] <%Speed1ines> Top right of the item card
[0:22:59] <%Tarage> Top left corner
[0:22:59] <@Lion_kun> The colour of the bars
[0:23:00] <%RayReborne> cuz higher level weapons get stronger with familiarity
[0:23:01] <slipdog> wow youre really good at this game i never got this far
[0:23:01] <%SWFanatic> drop the bass level
[0:23:02] <pixelkenj> Blue Bar
[0:23:03] <amiavamp> Top left
[0:23:03] <topiodonk> blue bar size
[0:23:04] <MyNameIsRasus> you look away from the cring level
[0:23:04] <amiavamp> whoops lmao
[0:23:05] <Admiral_PopnFresh> the 187
[0:23:07] <%Tarage> "Level 29"
[0:23:08] <%doubleslapmeharderwhitney> Purple has more of those blue bars, it can "level up" more than a yellow
[0:23:08] <%CappuccinoGuil> Top LEFT
[0:23:12] <%RayReborne> level 29 next to name
[0:23:13] <%Speed1ines> Top left
[0:23:14] <$IzazaOzihaha> Top left
[0:23:14] <+SiameseDuck> Yellow has 550 max familiarity and purple has 900, more familiarity will increase the stats more
[0:23:14] <Arqartur0> Nioh: Ram Ranch Edition
[0:23:15] <KAL5000> The familiarity level bigger bar
[0:23:15] <%AlteisenReiseZ> TOP LEFT
[0:23:16] <KaironFortressKnight> Level 29 both of them, but higher rarity, so its familiarity will end up being higher
[0:23:17] <%Piemono> Pat if your max familiarity dmg with your current weapon is 292, the new one is 284 with no familiarity
[0:23:18] <%SmiteKnight> Base level is top left
[0:23:20] <@Lion_kun> zero blue bar is 282, 2 blue bar is 294
[0:23:20] <%Agami23> right above the image of the weapon is "level"
[0:23:21] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt top left, they are both level 29
[0:23:25] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> one bar is 550 the other is max 900
[0:23:28] <+DatAsuna> attack multiplier is your baseline before familiarity is applied basically
[0:23:30] <@Lion_kun> so if the zero blue abr becomes two blue bar it will be better
[0:23:33] <theshillman> ABOVE THE WEAPON PORTRAIT
[0:23:34] <fimbulvetr27> Check item level and rarity. More rare means more of a damage boost from familiarity, and higher item level is just, well, higher item level
[0:23:34] <%Axellogic> Nioh 1 doesnt have the base damage stat
[0:23:36] <%Tarage> One is better because rarer.
[0:23:38] <%captain_thickthighs> weapon level is top left
[0:23:39] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt the higher rarity waepon has a higher damage cap
[0:23:39] <%MooseIsGoose> No way of knowing
[0:23:40] <Bonebagmel> Doesn't matter
[0:23:41] <MyNameIsRasus> it's the same weapon, wouldn't both of them have the same?
[0:23:43] <%valriot> Pat, number will go up if you use it
[0:23:45] <slipdog> Yes
[0:23:45] <Sonny_Firestorm> can't see it directly
[0:23:46] <%MooseIsGoose> because
[0:23:46] <KaironFortressKnight> 180, due to being the same weapon
[0:23:47] <+ReallyBigRocks> find out
[0:23:48] <+clevernamewhere> can't
[0:23:50] <PunishedVenomWolf> why would you need to know what it used to be?
[0:23:51] <%afronooch> LUL
[0:23:51] <%Tarage> TRY IT
[0:23:52] <%RayReborne> probably like 260-270??
[0:23:54] <radregice> :)
[0:23:54] <+ashunite> God this system is ass.
[0:23:55] <pixelkenj> Just equip good weapons as you go along dont worry about it
[0:23:56] <NateyBeak> isnt this also goblins
[0:23:56] <%Piemono> It doesn't matter, the new weapon will do more dmg with familiarity
[0:23:57] <+LokimenD> oh christ
[0:23:57] <%A_Mighty_Walrus> I think the weapon level dictates the base damage in a sense
[0:23:57] <%CappuccinoGuil> DON'T LET THE GOBLINS WIN
[0:23:57] <%BinaryFireball> game is anti numbers
[0:23:58] <+zanz_san> 187 and 180
[0:23:59] <@Lion_kun> Zero blue bar is 286
[0:23:59] <stormhawk9891> You just do
[0:23:59] <cartakus> You just ignore it
[0:24:00] <Bonebagmel> IF NUMBER BIGGER KNIFE BETTER
[0:24:02] <%AHomeschoolDropout> Your current one is maxed out, however the other one has slightly lower damage at 0 fam, but once you max it out it'll do much more damage
[0:24:02] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> BECAUSE WEVE ALL DONE THIS BEFORE PAT
[0:24:02] <moonmintparadise> this is fantastic LUL
[0:24:02] <+DatAsuna> the same weapon has the same base stats
[0:24:03] <Reborn2killu> special effects are what matter more@ pat
[0:24:04] <Albedo28> you can't go back and look, but the level is similar meaning their base damage would be the same if they didn't have different perks
[0:24:05] <@Lion_kun> 2 blue bar is 292
[0:24:06] <@GeneralSCPatton> Maybe they can feel it because of experience
[0:24:07] <Profmcstevie> Chat you can't say "you know" with no ACTUAL way of knowing
[0:24:07] <%A_Mighty_Walrus> so since it is the same level with a higher bar it will have a higher damage eventually
[0:24:07] <%Cozy90> BELIEVE
[0:24:08] <%RayReborne> we'd have to have seen it pre familiarity to know for sure
[0:24:08] <%MisterRockett> I hate the familiarity system because of THIS EXACT REASON
[0:24:09] <moonmintparadise> people are just saying shit at this point
[0:24:10] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt experience with the game, you can trust chat for some things
[0:24:10] <SunsetJack> High rarity means it can get more stats as you train the familiarity.
[0:24:12] <Cosairen> pat the damage is capped on this theres the potential for more damage with the new sword
[0:24:12] <%Tarage> GET OUT OF YOUR COMFORT ZONE AND TRY IT
[0:24:13] <Sonny_Firestorm> @PatStaresAt We have already estabilished your brain doesn't compute this game, so stop thinking and just go with it!
[0:24:14] <Admiral_PopnFresh> you don't, you grind to find out, it's not that big a deal
[0:24:14] <MicrotonalMatt> Number go up
[0:24:15] <SaltyAzteca> If you have whetstones you can instantly level it up
[0:24:15] <MyNameIsRasus> Fuck off whoever said these menus were good
[0:24:15] <+HuoShengdi> don't worry about it tbh
[0:24:17] <gnarly_memes_bro> @patstaresat the effect on the other one is why it will be better with more familiarity. this weapinndoesnt have that effect
[0:24:18] <T_Sasquatch> LUL
[0:24:19] <pixelkenj> do not minmax in Nioh
[0:24:20] <%Axellogic> If you hit stuff familiarity go up make number go up, its minor but purple gets more familiarity and has higher base damage
[0:24:21] <@Lion_kun> So 2 blue bar of the rarer weapon will have bigger number
[0:24:21] <+HuoShengdi> ignore chat on this
[0:24:22] <%Tarage> T R Y   I T
[0:24:22] <%Piemono> It always goes up
[0:24:24] <scrambledxeggz> This game sucks
[0:24:24] <robert_orri> TRUST THE PLAN
[0:24:25] <+rafaelba93> just use it
[0:24:26] <+clevernamewhere> purple weapon can be leveled up more
[0:24:27] <%GhoulishCripple> it won't pat
[0:24:27] <+zanz_san> Famiarity bonus C
[0:24:27] <+DatAsuna> Basically is it level 29, are you holding level 29?
[0:24:28] <KaironFortressKnight> Same weapon, same level.  Better rarity
[0:24:28] <%SWFanatic> psaGoblin psaMenace psaMenace psaMenace
[0:24:29] <Admiral_PopnFresh> it won't but ok
[0:24:29] <@Lion_kun> 900 familiarity gives much more damage
[0:24:29] <%MisterRockett> HOW DO I KNOW WHEN SWORD BETTER?
[0:24:29] <oda_flobunaga> Its Purple
[0:24:30] <cartakus> It won't
[0:24:30] <+KiwiRedgrave> BECAUSE THERE IS MORE BLUE BAR
[0:24:31] <%AlteisenReiseZ> It  increases base damage as well as all the attributes on the weapon, not just elemental effects.
[0:24:31] <%captain_thickthighs> because it already close to your current without you being familar too it so it has to be stronger
[0:24:32] <%RayReborne> no 900 gives you a lot more damage
[0:24:32] <+ReallyBigRocks> then switch back
[0:24:33] <yukichocomilk> literally doesn't matter
[0:24:33] <+JustToWatch> it will give you more than 8
[0:24:35] <KaironFortressKnight> It will be stronger
[0:24:35] <%AHomeschoolDropout> psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin
[0:24:36] <+theomnisoup> its way more than 4 damage
[0:24:38] <%valriot> Its generally around 10-20%
[0:24:39] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt Nioh is not BS like that
[0:24:41] <%Cozy90> REMEMBER THE SCRIMBLO FACTOR
[0:24:41] <+ProfessorMorrigan> awaken my goblins
[0:24:42] <Profmcstevie> It's a C rank familiar, it will grow fine
[0:24:42] <theshillman> 900 > 550
[0:24:45] <%MooseIsGoose> it normally gives like 8 or 10
[0:24:46] <Albedo28> thanks to it having the familiarity bonus perk, it'll get better than normal weapons without that perk
[0:24:47] <SunsetJack> Do it regardless cause you get skill points when you gain familiarity.
[0:24:47] <%octavian_wolf> Goblins are currently winning lmao
[0:24:50] <gnarly_memes_bro> it should give around 20
[0:24:50] <+SilverDevilfish> Level is higher, bar is bigger, Purple wepon
[0:24:51] <%isolex_> is it goblin time?
[0:24:53] <slipdog> 187
[0:24:54] <+HuoShengdi> you can just wait until you find an unambiguous upgrade
[0:24:55] <@Lion_kun> 550
[0:24:56] <+KiwiRedgrave> at 284
[0:24:57] <pixelkenj> too bad
[0:24:57] <%Tarage> 0
[0:24:57] <primaryfire> sometimes you just gotta do it and get a feel for it
[0:24:58] <@Lion_kun> 550/550
[0:24:58] <+JustToWatch> LESS
[0:24:59] <Bonebagmel> You get weapons so often that you might get something better before you max the fami
[0:24:59] <Cosairen> its the same sword pat
[0:24:59] <%GhoulishCripple> it's almost always 10+ more damage
[0:24:59] <Sonny_Firestorm> Same wep, same lv but higher rarity = more damage
[0:25:00] <%Tarage> It started at 0
[0:25:00] <primaryfire> it's a long game
[0:25:01] <%RayReborne> more blue bar= more power increase over time
[0:25:03] <cartakus> It started lower
[0:25:04] <+clevernamewhere> 0
[0:25:05] <%vivaldiva> psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin
[0:25:08] <amiavamp> The difference is so miniscule it really doesn't matter
[0:25:11] <%doomunderthestairs> I can see this one has been a bit rough
[0:25:12] <Admiral_PopnFresh> the goblins are strong
[0:25:12] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt like 265
[0:25:14] <MyNameIsRasus> Same weapon at same level, so same base dmg?
[0:25:15] <%CappuccinoGuil> Pat, familiarity goes up fast, just use this one for like, 30 minutes
[0:25:15] <%MooseIsGoose> it will be bigger
[0:25:16] <OverzealousEuthanasiast> numbers are a guessing game now, like the lottery!
[0:25:16] <yukichocomilk> this literally won't make a difference
[0:25:16] <+fattkennedy> it doesnt matter what it started at
[0:25:17] <@Lion_kun> You use it and number goes up.
[0:25:17] <%Tarage> They both start as the same probably
[0:25:18] <pixelkenj> time to scrub the footage
[0:25:20] <%MooseIsGoose> yup
[0:25:21] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt 265
[0:25:21] <Reborn2killu> yes
[0:25:22] <%captain_thickthighs> it doesn't matter what it started at
[0:25:22] <%Speed1ines> They started the same since it's the same weapon and the same level
[0:25:22] <%SharkMissile> A little
[0:25:23] <+JustToWatch> @PatStaresAt Pat, the weapon type and level are the same, it literally can't be worse
[0:25:23] <Admiral_PopnFresh> what @amiavamp said
[0:25:24] <theshillman> pat your stats make number go up
[0:25:24] <%Bt_Robot> Familiarity maxes out around a 20% bonus to damage, the other weapon is almost maxed out on familiarity and is barely better
[0:25:24] <pixelkenj> :)
[0:25:25] <%CappuccinoGuil> YUP, IT SURE DOES
[0:25:26] <cartakus> the fuck kinda sense is that?
[0:25:27] <%MooseIsGoose> you will get a fell for it
[0:25:27] <+SiameseDuck> Pretty much yeah
[0:25:28] <@Lion_kun> Yeah kinda.
[0:25:28] <shiny_prinny> A little bit yeah
[0:25:28] <%codedoomboy> It will over take it
[0:25:28] <%octavian_wolf> yeah boi
[0:25:28] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> it does suck yeah
[0:25:29] <Hamborgini> it's the same weapon with the same level, it probably had the same damage as your new one
[0:25:29] <%Axellogic> IN nioh 1 you do kinda have to learn it over time
[0:25:29] <Albedo28> its mostly about the perks and level of the weapon
[0:25:30] <soggy_mess> wtf is wrong with him
[0:25:31] <%SWFanatic> big succ
[0:25:31] <%BinaryFireball> I think so
[0:25:33] <+HuoShengdi> Pat you're being attacked by chat's minmax goblinw
[0:25:33] <%Tarage> Rarer thing = better
[0:25:33] <+rafaelba93> the new one has almost that, so it will get bigger by the end
[0:25:34] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt yse
[0:25:35] <primaryfire> doesn't make that much of a difference in the end
[0:25:35] <%CappuccinoGuil> IT'S STUPID, BUT YOU'RE RIGHT, IT'S FEEL
[0:25:37] <%RayReborne> Notlikethis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[0:25:37] <%Piemono> It wont
[0:25:37] <Profmcstevie> Yep, just FEEL the numbers
[0:25:38] <+fattkennedy> the more you use a weapon the more dmg
[0:25:38] <%SmiteKnight> Can't you use whetstones to automatically gain familiarity?
[0:25:40] <yukichocomilk> BUT IT'S NOT
[0:25:41] <KaironFortressKnight> NO IT CAN'T
[0:25:41] <%Tarage> LITERALLY CAN'T
[0:25:42] <Sonny_Firestorm> NO IT CANNOT
[0:25:43] <+JustToWatch> NO IT CAN'T
[0:25:43] <%CappuccinoGuil> PAT, RARITY COLORS
[0:25:44] <+tempestzephyr> i'm guessing if it's already close to what you have before familiarity, it'll prob grow bigger than what you have
[0:25:44] <%Speed1ines> It's the same weapon and same level
[0:25:44] <%BinaryFireball> bad design
[0:25:45] <@Lion_kun> RARER ITEMS WILL ALWAYS BE STRONGER
[0:25:49] <%Axellogic> All of the same weapon type has the same base stats
[0:25:49] <Cosairen> no it literally cant be its the same sword but better quality
[0:25:49] <fimbulvetr27> The weapons are the same item level, so they're both starting at 284
[0:25:49] <theshillman> @soggy_mess brain replaced by goblins
[0:25:49] <@Lion_kun> Purple better than yellow
[0:25:51] <%Tarage> THAT IS NOT HOW GAME WORK
[0:25:52] <+metalicblackcherry> 284?
[0:25:53] <%doomunderthestairs> ohh boy the goblins are rampant tonight
[0:25:55] <%MisterRockett> TIME TO RESTART
[0:25:56] <+DatAsuna> familiarity takes time to grind up anyway so don't bother replacing your weapon until the new weapon is stronger at 0 familarity now than what you're holding
[0:26:00] <%Axellogic> both are Sukesada Odachi
[0:26:02] <+ultimafullmetal> Is there a tutorial in the options somewhere
[0:26:04] <topiodonk> pat doing the big pout
[0:26:04] <cartakus> Just levrl it up a little to see
[0:26:05] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt Pat Nioh is not BS like that it will be better
[0:26:05] <slipdog> crazy talk
[0:26:08] <Albedo28> if there isn't a perk that says (damage) then an weapon with a perk that says damage will be better
[0:26:08] <+KiwiRedgrave> oohhhh its the goblins, theyre goblining!
[0:26:10] <%captain_thickthighs> no the other is close to your current weapon but has no familarity so its number has to be bigger
[0:26:13] <+NahmenJayden> welcome in Nioh
[0:26:14] <Admiral_PopnFresh> @PatStaresAt any weapon of the exact same type and level will have the same base number
[0:26:14] <@Lion_kun> Pat Green>Purple>Blue>Yellow
[0:26:17] <%JoshManVGH> Does anyone know how how much attack familiarity translates into?
[0:26:17] <%RayReborne> Rarer weapons are ALWAYS stronger Pat
[0:26:18] <Sonny_Firestorm> 40 hours is nothing
[0:26:19] <cartakus> This is hell
[0:26:20] <@Lion_kun> Just go by the colour.
[0:26:28] <%Tarage> Big angry
[0:26:29] <amiavamp> There are items to make familiarity increase but I think I never used them among the 100 other items the game throws at you lol
[0:26:30] <radregice> it will probably continue
[0:26:30] <%MooseIsGoose> your fine it is obtuse as fuck
[0:26:30] <Sonny_Firestorm> THIS ISN'T SOULS
[0:26:30] <SaltyAzteca> There a trap here
[0:26:35] <OverzealousEuthanasiast> the menu numbers are a fresh hell
[0:26:36] <yukichocomilk> the thing is you literally don't have to minmax until ng+, it's pointless
[0:26:38] <%RayReborne> @cartakus man yeah kinda
[0:26:39] <Sonny_Firestorm> Get your brain out of souls
[0:26:39] <+HuoShengdi> green won't drop until end of game
[0:26:40] <@GeneralSCPatton> Do you have whetstones? They give instant familiarity.
[0:26:41] <topiodonk> this is diablo
[0:26:41] <@Lion_kun> Rarerer weapons will have more damage.
[0:26:47] <+rafaelba93> relax and dont think too much
[0:26:48] <%Axellogic> Purple best you can get and they're the same level and name
[0:26:49] <+fattkennedy> you go by dmg and familiarity
[0:26:49] <@Lion_kun> Rarer*
[0:26:49] <%CappuccinoGuil> Same weapon, same level, similar damage, but higher rarity. This one is better
[0:26:51] <KaironFortressKnight> Go by level and rarity
[0:26:53] <primaryfire> you'll come to see that it's not that important
[0:26:56] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt you are seriously overthinking it and killing yourself for nothing
[0:26:56] <+DatAsuna> My advice is to just not bother replacing your sword until the new sword is just higher level enough that it does more damage, or has a really good substat
[0:26:56] <+ashunite> That's still ass tbh even if you go by colour cos it feels counter intuitive to drop to a lower number
[0:26:58] <pixelkenj> Sell junk by color, then go by damage
[0:26:59] <+McSoliace> damage + color
[0:27:00] <%Speed1ines> Just ignore it, you'll get a clearly better one in 10 mintues anyway
[0:27:01] <slipdog> have you done the BOFA tutorial yet? it makes more sense after that
[0:27:01] <RyuuAoi> This looks like Souls
[0:27:02] <%CappuccinoGuil> Rarer weapons will be better IF they are same type and level.
[0:27:10] <%Saadi90> It doesn't even matter this early in the game. Stop confusing him.
[0:27:11] <gnarly_memes_bro> it's gonna take a little while
[0:27:13] <DXLelouch24> Just go bigger number i did and it was fine
[0:27:15] <@Lion_kun> In new game purple is the best and in new game+ green is the best
[0:27:15] <Albedo28> its a confusing arse system that makes it hard to check what's worth investing in. Basically, Level is most important, then rarity. Familiarity raises quickly
[0:27:15] <MicrotonalMatt> Feels like playing an IF Nep game with its number nonsense
[0:27:20] <%JoshManVGH> Once you fill a bar, you will see a stat gain
[0:27:20] <%Axellogic> Familiarity will take a second to fill
[0:27:22] <SaltyAzteca> Careful where you walk, theres a trap here
[0:27:22] <%CappuccinoGuil> Familiarity damage increases in segments, right?
[0:27:24] <%SWFanatic> Next Bit
[0:27:26] <+DatAsuna> You were correct to call it trash, don't worry about it
[0:27:26] <@Lion_kun> And in new game ++ orange is the brst
[0:27:26] <KaironFortressKnight> Mind Onis in full swing tonight
[0:27:26] <oda_flobunaga> I know
[0:27:27] <%Tarage> We are here to help you not kill yourself
[0:27:28] <%tank7013> The notches in the familiarity bar are thresholds for the damage increase
[0:27:29] <%GhoulishCripple> @patstaresat there is an item to boost familiarity i dunno if you have any
[0:27:30] <Bonebagmel> no don't do it doe
[0:27:31] <+Doomtastic> welcome to mind goblins
[0:27:31] <%rkbinder> keep going
[0:27:34] <+fattkennedy> it may have lower dmg but has more room to grow
[0:27:34] <radregice> this is THE goblin stream
[0:27:36] <%RayReborne> true but holy shit Pat Kappa
[0:27:36] <pixelkenj> :)
[0:27:37] <fimbulvetr27> Do you have any whetstones? Those give your equipped weapons a chunk of familiarity
[0:27:38] <RyuuAoi> This is his Goblins
[0:27:40] <cartakus> I though the point was to stop overthinking
[0:27:41] <pokefan9956> let the man do his therapy in peace
[0:27:42] <topiodonk> lol lmao
[0:27:42] <%MooseIsGoose> You have to make it to one of those pips in order for the damage to go up
[0:27:42] <SaltyAzteca> HE LIVED
[0:27:44] <+ashunite> aaw jeez
[0:27:45] <Profmcstevie> Thank you chat member for pointing out the thing he is doing
[0:27:46] <$Jaxnos> so is the familiarity of the weapon at 187 maxed out at 550?
[0:27:47] <@GeneralSCPatton> Use whetstones to max the familiarity now?
[0:27:47] <+HuoShengdi> don't let chat's minmax goblins trigger your goblins
[0:27:47] <pixelkenj> sens fortress
[0:27:47] <Cosairen> SENS FORTRESS
[0:27:48] <Albedo28> perks make or break a weapon where there are some perks that are just always better than a weapon with the same or slightly better stats without an S tier perk
[0:27:49] <%JoshManVGH> Is there a flat rate to familiarity bars?
[0:27:52] <theshillman> LUL LUL LUL LUL LUL LUL
[0:27:54] <%transporterthesequel> To be fair, it's EVERYONE's goblins
[0:27:55] <%captain_thickthighs> just trust in the hive brain:chat
[0:27:56] <huskarl_zap> Not enough YOOOOOOOOO
[0:27:56] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> not bad, usually peeps get one shot
[0:27:59] <Sonny_Firestorm> pop a whestone
[0:27:59] <shiny_prinny> as a light armor player, that would absolutely have killed me
[0:28:02] <+jt427> isnt there an item that raises familiarity bonus? you could use that and see exactly how much it goes up to understand
[0:28:07] <pixelkenj> Dont forget to use your ninjutsu or spells to get incremental skill XP
[0:28:11] <$IzazaOzihaha> Max Dood realized too late about "crushed to death"
[0:28:12] <theshillman> @Albedo28 yeah but he wont see those for a good long while
[0:28:13] <%Axellogic> You accidently went backwards
[0:28:13] <@Lion_kun> This is the most goblins it's ever been.
[0:28:17] <oda_flobunaga> Familiarity boost rate is totally flat
[0:28:19] <Sonny_Firestorm> use a whetstone
[0:28:25] <Cosairen> how did pat get anywhere in destiny when the gun loot is very similar in complexity
[0:28:26] <amiavamp> Frankly Nioh is stressful, even when you're breezing through it
[0:28:28] <%MooseIsGoose> your fine even as a fan of this game I know it can suck with all of its numbers
[0:28:29] <DXLelouch24> Big number and purple color you first run and your golden
[0:28:32] <%RayReborne> @lion_kun agreed by a LANDSLIDE LUL
[0:28:40] <cartakus> The traps in nioh are mean
[0:28:51] <+DeadlyPeaks> Goblin: Restart to relearn mechanics
[0:28:53] <pixelkenj> true
[0:28:56] <Sonny_Firestorm> You're not wrong.
[0:28:57] <%SWFanatic> Warframe loot is also stupidly complicated
[0:28:57] <@Lion_kun> It simplifies it in Nioh 2
[0:28:57] <+TopTieramisu> nioh has so many traps it's ridiculous
[0:28:58] <slipdog> revolving door loot SUCKS
[0:28:59] <+DatAsuna> When you have a good sword, the next sword probably won't come along for several levels
[0:28:59] <ToneBacas> yep.
[0:29:03] <%octavian_wolf> these DnD traps, FOR REAL
[0:29:03] <Sonny_Firestorm> But ignore them and you'll be just fine.
[0:29:04] <amiavamp> More numbers than a Compile Heart game
[0:29:04] <topiodonk> yeah, it seems like min max hell
[0:29:05] <%SmiteKnight> I think if you use a whetstone, you can gain familiarity automatically. I think 4 whetstones will max it out.
[0:29:07] <+TopTieramisu> every area in nioh is sens fortress
[0:29:08] <Profmcstevie> I wonder how much it's bumpy development contributes
[0:29:09] <@Lion_kun> Numbers are easier to understand in Nioh 2
[0:29:09] <T_Sasquatch> Sometimes you don't need to understand everything in a game, just do it 4Head
[0:29:12] <%studleydoorite> I thought you loved numbers? I guess too much of a good thing etc.
[0:29:12] <%Axellogic> The numbers add up but you cant tell til late game when you can mess around more freely
[0:29:12] <%GabeSweetMan> Just got home. FUCK. I have the exact same goblins for this game. I never got past the start of the 2nd major area.
[0:29:15] <$Jaxnos> cuz if the familiarity of the yellow weapon is maxed and its strength is only 7 higher than the one with a higher familiarity cap, then that one will surpass it. i refuse to believe each level of familiarity would give you less than 2 additional points of attack.
[0:29:17] <+DatAsuna> Nioh 2 actively adds more numbers and more item types though, you're lying
[0:29:18] <+fattkennedy> people like that shit... pointless numbers
[0:29:20] <+clevernamewhere> YEah, the systems overly compicated
[0:29:21] <+NahmenJayden> "pointless numbers"
[0:29:21] <ToneBacas> the procedurally generated gear is really unnecessary
[0:29:22] <+HuoShengdi> once you hit like NG+2 the numbers start mattering
[0:29:22] <radregice> i would like more numbers actually
[0:29:23] <soggy_mess> true zhe numbers are mmo tier garbo at times
[0:29:29] <Albedo28> it saw that dark souls has a bizarre damage system and decided putting MORE modifiers on everything would make it better
[0:29:29] <+DatAsuna> He's not even trying to comprehend yokai cores here
[0:29:31] <%valriot> Nioh 2 is way more easier game to get into
[0:29:33] <pixelkenj> minmaxing doesnt matter till NG+++++ :)
[0:29:33] <%RayReborne> theres MORE numbers in 2 arguably
[0:29:35] <Hamborgini> I forget, does Nioh 1 have the status screen that shows -all- of your buffs in a big-ass list?
[0:29:37] <amiavamp> I stopped paying attention to anything but number go up on the main stat. And elemental damage.
[0:29:37] <cartakus> Honestly the numbers seems to be for crazy people that can do the +++game
[0:29:37] <SunsetJack> If I recall, the game wants you to change weapons often when you max out familiarity to get more skill points.
[0:29:38] <+ashunite> GUN
[0:29:40] <%valriot> This is why people say play Nioh 2 LUL
[0:29:41] <slipdog> i wish they copied dark souls just a liiiittle more. open world and no diablo loot sytem
[0:29:43] <$IzazaOzihaha> I don't even pay attention to a lot of the numbers. I get bigger damage number and more advantageous boosts. All I need.
[0:29:43] <RyuuAoi> Wow look at these jobbers
[0:29:45] <%GabeSweetMan> GUN
[0:29:45] <@GeneralSCPatton> Use whetstones for 150 free familiarity
[0:29:47] <%Djinnazz> Pointless for now
[0:29:48] <oda_flobunaga> Hand cannon, ooooooh
[0:29:50] <@Lion_kun> Just focus on the numbers good for your build, ignore everything else.
[0:29:51] <%Saadi90> I am an accountant. i like numbers
[0:29:52] <+itsmonktastic> so the mind goblin is picking up a game they left partway through years ago?
[0:29:52] <Albedo28> Gun is best ranged weapon
[0:29:52] <+Local16> @PatStaresAt Nioh 2 still has the numbers but feels more friendly with it's presentation of them
[0:29:55] <+HuoShengdi> yeah nioh 2 has more numbers but presents them better
[0:29:56] <+ElReaping> how else are you supposed to blow up bosses on Dream of the Nioh without number knowledge
[0:30:04] <shiny_prinny> oh shit onyudo time
[0:30:07] <pixelkenj> good time to pop your devil trigger
[0:30:09] <Sonny_Firestorm> @slipdog THIS ISN'T DARK SOULS. This is Ninja Gaiden but more down to earth.
[0:30:09] <oda_flobunaga> Onyudo
[0:30:11] <%BinaryFireball> tongueeee
[0:30:12] <cartakus> Tongue boi is sexy boi
[0:30:15] <%Axellogic> Nioh 2 makes more sense but theres MORE so it wouldnt help with the goblins as much as people would like, Skill trees are waaaay better though
[0:30:18] <+NahmenJayden> rip
[0:30:20] <+fattkennedy> I put in about 60 hrs for nioh before i dropped it
[0:30:21] <+KiwiRedgrave> hes also strong againt your damage type
[0:30:23] <Sonny_Firestorm> DT
[0:30:25] <pixelkenj> these monks are hardcore
[0:30:27] <%SWFanatic> this seems like a chalice dungeon
[0:30:31] <MicrotonalMatt> Licky boy
[0:30:31] <huskarl_zap> Is that the Akuma?
[0:30:32] <oda_flobunaga> Living Weapon that shit
[0:30:34] <+DatAsuna> I disagree about better presentation, the skill trees here being linear is more intuitive sense than seeing every passive and every upgrade at once
[0:30:36] <amiavamp> Sorry, it's still souls, most of the bosses still consist of poking the thing in the 5 second window you get
[0:30:44] <slipdog> we get it dude you ate a blue raspberry sucker
[0:30:45] <+KiwiRedgrave> use living weapon
[0:30:45] <@Lion_kun> I didn't say Nioh 2 had less numbers, only that they are easier to understand.
[0:30:49] <Cosairen> pat use your cooldowns
[0:30:50] <primaryfire> you can get through it fine by just equipping the higher number gear
[0:30:54] <+NahmenJayden> slow is OP
[0:30:59] <Albedo28> become invincible with living weapon. easy boss
[0:31:00] <theshillman> punish HARD when they're out of ki
[0:31:02] <@Lion_kun> use spirit
[0:31:04] <T_Sasquatch> @amiavamp if you're bad sure
[0:31:05] <%Axellogic> When enemies are out of Ki their bar is red and they can be staggerlocked
[0:31:08] <Admiral_PopnFresh> these guys are tricky for new players
[0:31:11] <%Speed1ines> @PatStaresAt When yokai are outta stamina, they always flinch
[0:31:11] <+HuoShengdi> gj
[0:31:12] <huskarl_zap> is this thee shenlong?
[0:31:13] <cartakus> I don't know how someone could play this game with a slow dodge
[0:31:14] <%octavian_wolf> 2 more
[0:31:14] <%MooseIsGoose> chest
[0:31:15] <+fattkennedy> lol I forgot how CO-OP makes this game a helluva alot easier
[0:31:15] <pixelkenj> One down
[0:31:22] <+TopTieramisu> when they're out of ki, they have no poise
[0:31:22] <SunsetJack> 1/3 objective done.
[0:31:24] <%studleydoorite> that's it Pog
[0:31:26] <TurtlesAndTentacles> why is pat playing a good game?
[0:31:26] <pixelkenj> Catacombs are done
[0:31:27] <%BinaryFireball> was that venom's dad?
[0:31:27] <+polothegreatest> perverted monk
[0:31:28] <RyuuAoi> Easy mode?
[0:31:31] <Sonny_Firestorm> One Down, Two to Go
[0:31:40] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Pat, you can also set up your inventory to not pick up anything below yellow or blue
[0:31:41] <KaironFortressKnight> Oh god
[0:31:45] <%GabeSweetMan> Oh god I forgot Familiarity....
[0:31:46] <@Lion_kun> no
[0:31:49] <%Axellogic> blue is better than white
[0:31:50] <@Lion_kun> It is not better
[0:31:51] <+DatAsuna> @Lion_kun And I said that it adds more kinds of numbers with mechanics he'd overwhelm himself even more with like core salvaging lol
[0:31:59] <@Lion_kun> Blue is better than white.
[0:32:03] <azure_dunes> I played the demo for nioh 2 and it was goddamn fantastic, shame I wasn't able to get it on release
[0:32:08] <+McSoliace> that one was better enough
[0:32:09] <%SmiteKnight> It makes me feel bad for Pat that he sounds so stressed out playing a video game.
[0:32:10] <%Axellogic> White-yellow-blue-purple
[0:32:10] <+DatAsuna> Imagine him trying to minmax yokai abilities
[0:32:11] <+HuoShengdi> his blue is lower level
[0:32:13] <%studleydoorite> sweet recorder solo
[0:32:18] <$IzazaOzihaha> It is better leveled for bigger damage, but blue has inherently better boosts.
[0:32:19] <theshillman> oh boy
[0:32:19] <+HuoShengdi> the white is better enough
[0:32:22] <%RayReborne> losing NOTHING
[0:32:27] <%MooseIsGoose> no
[0:32:27] <%captain_thickthighs> if these numbers are bad i cant imagine pat doing armored core
[0:32:28] <HoboFlea> Nioh would have been impossible with 9 hundred people giving me advice. I believe in you Pat
[0:32:29] <amiavamp> @T_Sasquatch sorry I forgot buffing yourself with 10 spells and mashing attack button
[0:32:31] <huskarl_zap> btw being a slow omniyo is the big dick move
[0:32:35] <%Saadi90> nope
[0:32:35] <+DatAsuna> It's lighter and stronger
[0:32:37] <stormhawk9891> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[0:32:39] <@Lion_kun> @Lion_kun All I can say is I played both games and I had a lot of an easier time understanding the numbers in Nioh 2 and making my build.
[0:32:40] <cartakus> Only worry about big number next to the item
[0:32:42] <%GabeSweetMan> I don't blame Pat, this was my exact experience.
[0:32:42] <moonmintparadise> no
[0:32:42] <soggy_mess> THE GOBLINS... THEY SING TO ME.
[0:32:45] <%Broand> yeesh I've not seen pat brain like this for a while
[0:32:47] <%Axellogic> Damage reduction is static by weight class of armor
[0:32:48] <slipdog> you defeat the mind goblins by just ignoring everything but Attack and fashion and just enjoy fun weeb gam
[0:32:49] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> the weight is even better
[0:32:52] <didgereedoodah> substats don't really matter on NG
[0:32:54] <T_Sasquatch> @amiavamp 👍😋
[0:32:59] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> dont become addicted to set bonuses, keep pushing defense multiplyer
[0:33:01] <%JoshManVGH> Jesus it doesn't say how much familiarity boost weapons anywhere
[0:33:02] <+DatAsuna> For now the only armor stats you should care about are defense and weight
[0:33:04] <soggy_mess> ENOUGH TO MAKE A MAN SICK
[0:33:05] <Albedo28> I agree with slipdog
[0:33:09] <+Savarro> yokai abilities were the easiest shit in the world. "I like that one, I use that one"
[0:33:09] <Louie_Salmon> @cartakus But then why are there small numbers
[0:33:13] <%captain_thickthighs> Stop and breath dude
[0:33:13] <%rkbinder> Do it at the end of level
[0:33:18] <+DatAsuna> Set bonuses in nioh aren't worth chasing yeah
[0:33:22] <+TopTieramisu> the diablo loot system is one of my least favorite aspects of nioh
[0:33:22] <slipdog> let it go, let it goo
[0:33:26] <cartakus> Because fuck you
[0:33:31] <T_Sasquatch> Breatheeeeeee
[0:33:34] <%SWFanatic> Do the la la la
[0:33:36] <%RayReborne> equipment accessories
[0:33:37] <+DatAsuna> They're just not good enough for how the RNG can constrict you
[0:33:37] <T_Sasquatch> Pat BREATHE
[0:33:37] <%tanarath> I feel like for most, looking up guides would help, but for Pat it'd possibly make this worse.
[0:33:38] <%GabeSweetMan> I really REALLY wish drops weren't randomized.
[0:33:38] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt breathe, center yourself
[0:33:44] <+HuoShengdi> nioh set bonuses only matter at like NG+4
[0:33:45] <%MooseIsGoose> it is a charm think like a ring from dark souls
[0:33:46] <@Lion_kun> Equip the medicine, it's big health
[0:33:47] <%Djinnazz> Ignore it till you get to the blacksmith.
[0:33:49] <%Axellogic> I mostly ignore the consumables
[0:33:54] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> @patstaresat Just look at the big number. Other stats only matter in NG+.
[0:33:55] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Yeah, deep breath. I don't wanna see you kill yourself over this, dude.
[0:33:58] <+HuoShengdi> aka the final NG cycle
[0:34:08] <+DatAsuna> also yeah, doing all your inventory between quests is ideal
[0:34:08] <%SWFanatic> Resident Evillllll
[0:34:19] <pixelkenj> because chat is so smart about mechanics
[0:34:20] <+DatAsuna> because they're stupid
[0:34:20] <crimsonsaens> There's another item in the coffin
[0:34:20] <%SWFanatic> That Yokaii's a maniac!
[0:34:22] <@Lion_kun> Purple will always have bigger number.
[0:34:22] <%MooseIsGoose> because
[0:34:23] <+TopTieramisu> purple doesn't have familiarity yet
[0:34:23] <%Speed1ines> ignore small number forever, just do big number until you get higher
[0:34:24] <%tank7013> Because purple will get higher
[0:34:25] <akitanito> to trigger your goblins
[0:34:25] <$IzazaOzihaha> Because people are stupid.
[0:34:27] <%Speed1ines> Fuck rarity
[0:34:27] <Reborn2killu> you asked>
[0:34:27] <Dopamien> 🤷
[0:34:28] <%SWFanatic> Whyd he bite me!
[0:34:28] <+DatAsuna> they only look at tier
[0:34:28] <+HuoShengdi> Because chat's goblins are talking
[0:34:29] <primaryfire> they're correct but it doesn't matter
[0:34:30] <cartakus> For now it has higher
[0:34:31] <SunsetJack> Number will go high eventually...
[0:34:32] <RyuuAoi> They don't know, Pat
[0:34:32] <%Axellogic> Pueple will go higher but it doesnt matter much
[0:34:34] <Profmcstevie> Because it will BECOME big number
[0:34:36] <knight_verse> Pat, if blue arrow go up then it's better than what you have, if red arrow go down then it's worse.
[0:34:37] <%JoshManVGH> blue bar will make other one higher
[0:34:38] <SaltyAzteca> Purple number become higher than blue number
[0:34:41] <+TopTieramisu> familiarity
[0:34:41] <@Lion_kun> Big number at max familiarity.
[0:34:42] <+theomnisoup> purple will be bigger number
[0:34:42] <+ReallyBigRocks> it doesn't really matter as long as you hit guy
[0:34:44] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt check your inventory, do you have a whetstone?
[0:34:45] <+MrSuplexArt> the real mind goblin is listening to chat
[0:34:45] <+HuoShengdi> Pat chat has mind goblins too
[0:34:47] <@GeneralSCPatton> DO YOU HAVE WHETSTONES? INSTANT FAMILIARITY
[0:34:48] <%octavian_wolf> weapons GET better, armor does not
[0:34:49] <crimsonsaens> Purple weapon will get bigger number with familiarity
[0:34:50] <%IronOhki> Ignore chat, Play video game. This is the goblins.
[0:34:50] <%captain_thickthighs> the number will get bigger later
[0:34:51] <%Axellogic> higher level gear matters more
[0:34:51] <@Lion_kun> Big familiarity for biggest number
[0:34:52] <Admiral_PopnFresh> because purple WILL be higher, it is the same name and level of weapon, the color does number
[0:34:54] <RyuuAoi> Pat they just wanna feel special!
[0:34:54] <%Cozy90> ignore it but also dont ignore it!
[0:34:56] <+Local16> @PatStaresAt Number on purple will go higher eventually. But on NG you can totally ignore than and got big from start.
[0:34:57] <+DatAsuna> Purple would become higher if you grinded it, but you will drop another sword before you max it anyway, so they're dumb
[0:34:58] <%Nordguy> they are right but very small number different in the end
[0:34:58] <Cosairen> number BECOME BIGGER
[0:35:01] <Profmcstevie> Big number is not a simpletons pursuit
[0:35:01] <%SWFanatic> Wet Stussy
[0:35:03] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> because that one's familiarity is already maxed , and the other one has the same base damage but higher familiarity, so the other's end number might be bigger
[0:35:04] <%RayReborne> The higher number for the weapon you're currently using is TEMPORARILY stronger, use the newer weapon for enough time it gets stronger than old, yellow class weapon
[0:35:04] <amiavamp> It's just Diablo 3 braindead loot but with a dozen red herrings thrown in
[0:35:05] <%Djinnazz> Purple will BE higher
[0:35:05] <%GabeSweetMan> BUT WHAT IF YOU NEED IT LATER?!
[0:35:07] <T_Sasquatch> Big number
[0:35:08] <cartakus> USE IT
[0:35:13] <oda_flobunaga> Use a few of them
[0:35:14] <%JoshManVGH> Use another
[0:35:14] <Zaphire_Saucypants> The point of this exercise is to do what you want and enjoy the game, damn where you are in the game's content, right?
[0:35:15] <%CappuccinoGuil> increases familiarity
[0:35:15] <+theomnisoup> use more
[0:35:15] <+McSoliace> one more
[0:35:16] <klx5> now the purple is stronger
[0:35:17] <+DatAsuna> No weapon is worth maxing familiarity on before postgame
[0:35:20] <SaltyAzteca> Whetstone =  number go up
[0:35:21] <$Jaxnos> pump number, make good
[0:35:22] <oda_flobunaga> Use 2 more of them
[0:35:26] <$IzazaOzihaha> Increase familiarity, leads to bigger numbers.
[0:35:30] <%captain_thickthighs> use more
[0:35:31] <cheapdoc> How is Pat doing?
[0:35:36] <knight_verse> Just look it up in google then.
[0:35:37] <+ReallyBigRocks> number go up
[0:35:39] <cartakus> See?
[0:35:40] <@Lion_kun> Very badly.
[0:35:46] <SaltyAzteca> One more whetstone
[0:35:47] <+McSoliace> one more
[0:35:49] <%Speed1ines> Fuck rarity, you'll replace it in 10 minutes anyway with bigger number
[0:35:50] <%JoshManVGH> It's increasing your familiarity with the weapon It's not done
[0:35:52] <@Lion_kun> But it's not max.
[0:35:53] <SunsetJack> It isn't maxed out yet.
[0:35:53] <+TopTieramisu> it was gonna get there eventually
[0:35:55] <+DatAsuna> I said, don't worry about familiarity
[0:35:59] <slipdog> nobodys ever gonna know Pat
[0:36:00] <+theomnisoup> whetstones drop like candy
[0:36:00] <cartakus> Well if you just kept playing
[0:36:01] <%octavian_wolf> HMM
[0:36:01] <%SWFanatic> lubricate
[0:36:02] <%AlteisenReiseZ> HA
[0:36:03] <Cosairen> LUL
[0:36:05] <$Jaxnos> uh huh
[0:36:05] <%captain_thickthighs> see
[0:36:06] <@Lion_kun> Crazy talk.
[0:36:09] <%GabeSweetMan> I hate this game's inventory.
[0:36:10] <+LokimenD> Happy?
[0:36:11] <+upandadam> hit those breakpoints
[0:36:11] <%Saadi90> Chat win!
[0:36:13] <SaltyAzteca> Purple strong. Big number
[0:36:13] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> you'll get there
[0:36:14] <+jt427> LUL
[0:36:15] <%Axellogic> They arent lying but its not as big a deal as it seems
[0:36:17] <KaironFortressKnight> Can we be smug
[0:36:17] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> Familarity ALSO increases the secondary stats on the weapons as well
[0:36:17] <+DatAsuna> Familiarity is to be ignored until you have your endgame "forever sword"
[0:36:19] <+JustToWatch> also it had more bonus stats
[0:36:19] <%Monkeyweed21> Did Pat see that Nurgle has a pants shit spell?
[0:36:23] <SunsetJack> Go back outside.
[0:36:24] <%captain_thickthighs> trust in the legion for we are many
[0:36:29] <RyuuAoi> Never understood why Pat and Woolie always listened to chat "corrections" What if chat is wrong about the correction?
[0:36:29] <%JoshManVGH> Now it's maxed, so Familiarity is like Soul Bound. but on weapons you get a perk.
[0:36:30] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt everything about the loot grind suscks ass
[0:36:35] <T_Sasquatch> This area of the game looks awful aesthetically
[0:36:40] <+JustToWatch> dig up stupid
[0:36:42] <Profmcstevie> How much does each increase of damage numbers matter in Nioh? Does a 5 damage increase fucking own or no?
[0:36:47] <$IzazaOzihaha> Half the audience is pulling at him from different directions, the other half is insisting it's all garbage.
[0:36:50] <%Psych_man13_13> Pat freaking out is making me freak out
[0:36:53] <Explodincatz> why is the map so bad?
[0:37:00] <kikoeru_san> oh Pat's doing 2 heavy weapons? Bold move
[0:37:03] <+DatAsuna> @Profmcstevie Really minor tbh, 5 damage is nothing
[0:37:03] <%Axellogic> They do that so you cant fight by the shrine
[0:37:05] <+KiwiRedgrave> they got scared cause you stabbed them
[0:37:05] <KaironFortressKnight> You scared them by STABBING the save point
[0:37:06] <+HuoShengdi> you scared your shrine buddies by attacking them
[0:37:07] <+polothegreatest> So it uses the wet system
[0:37:08] <kikoeru_san> Power move
[0:37:11] <%AncelDeLambert> it's almost like RNG weapon stats suck and have always sucked and the industry shouldn't do it anymore
[0:37:12] <SaltyAzteca> You can get more
[0:37:12] <amiavamp> Enemies drop them
[0:37:13] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> yeah that sucks
[0:37:14] <@Lion_kun> This is the worst the goblins have ever been.
[0:37:14] <$Futurecity10> damn almost like this game sucks
[0:37:18] <%RayReborne> @izazaozihaha its just that its not that important for a regular playthrough
[0:37:18] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> donate at the shrine
[0:37:20] <%SWFanatic> Yokaii needs food badly!
[0:37:21] <SaltyAzteca> Offer item to kodama
[0:37:21] <%MugenSandan> Not if you find the little guys
[0:37:23] <%Saadi90> you get so many
[0:37:23] <Admiral_PopnFresh> like bloodborned
[0:37:23] <%Monkeyweed21> FARM BLOOD VIALS SERF
[0:37:23] <%barrakuta371> gobolins
[0:37:24] <+theomnisoup> offer equipment to the shrine for more
[0:37:25] <%JoshManVGH> You refull like estus though
[0:37:25] <didgereedoodah> you can never fully run out
[0:37:27] <%Axellogic> Goblin city
[0:37:27] <%IronOhki> Estus was the best design idea ever.
[0:37:28] <+TopTieramisu> if pat freaking out makes you freak out, you should find a different outlet LUL
[0:37:29] <+KiwiRedgrave> just dont get hit
[0:37:30] <Profmcstevie> Oh the blood vials....oh they sing to me
[0:37:30] <stormhawk9891> Yeah that one sucks
[0:37:33] <%tank7013> I think you always get 3
[0:37:33] <@Lion_kun> If you find all the kodama, you will always have at least 8 elixir.
[0:37:33] <%Psych_man13_13> you default to a few if you run out
[0:37:33] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt no you can't, it restocks up to 3 or 4
[0:37:36] <Cosairen> @AncelDeLambert i like them :)
[0:37:37] <%G_Thunders> Can’t you buy them?
[0:37:38] <%greasypete00> that's my least favourite part of the game
[0:37:38] <primaryfire> offering junk at shrines gives you a few bonus elixirs but not much
[0:37:38] <%Broand> There's a baseline too
[0:37:42] <RyuuAoi> Blood borne sucked for that
[0:37:43] <T_Sasquatch> I don't recall running out
[0:37:44] <BettyMwwaahh> get the healing magic. I always had 100 plus medicine
[0:37:47] <SwindlerOfProgress> @Explodincatz Because they made skills to make it good. It's weird, but almost useless without them
[0:37:48] <Samuy_JP> Yeah Bloodborne  sucks
[0:37:49] <%valriot> Pat thats the same as Bloodborne, but you get more using the donate in the Shrine
[0:37:51] <+HuoShengdi> yeah you have a baseline of like 3
[0:37:53] <%Djinnazz> No you cant
[0:37:55] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> pat you can move while aiming
[0:37:58] <%Bt_Robot> YOU MEAN LIKE YOUR FAVORITE GAME EVER, BLOODBORNE?
[0:38:05] <%GabeSweetMan> You.... did it.
[0:38:06] <+TopTieramisu> who the hell is shitting on bloodborne
[0:38:08] <Admiral_PopnFresh> this is a train wreck and I can't look away
[0:38:08] <SainEdge> yeah you always get 3 medicine or so
[0:38:08] <%Axellogic> You will always have a minimum of 3 healing items no matter what when you pray
[0:38:10] <+MosesUnspoken> lol
[0:38:10] <didgereedoodah> you can move while aiming
[0:38:11] <kikoeru_san> yeah, you gotta get the drop buff for elixir from the kodama
[0:38:13] <%JoshManVGH> as you find more of the little dudes, the amount of elixer you get at the srine goes up.
[0:38:20] <shiny_prinny> round 2
[0:38:21] <What_Up_Duck> I play on controller on pc for Nioh 2, but I always grab the mouse when I pull out the bow. Shit's awful.
[0:38:25] <SaltyAzteca> Thats Max, not Pat LUL
[0:38:25] <+Savarro> Like I LOVE Nioh, but goddamn if it isn't the final boss form for Pat's goblins
[0:38:27] <$Jaxnos> whoever said that thinks they're in a max stream
[0:38:31] <T_Sasquatch> Guys blood vials suck but after you actually get better you stop having issues with bloodvials
[0:38:32] <+DatAsuna> bloodborne didn't give you freebies like kodama do weither
[0:38:33] <Treasure_Vault> Blood vials is a step down from estus.
[0:38:33] <%AncelDeLambert> the gems in Bloodborne were shit and should it ever come to pc that is the first thing that will be modded out
[0:38:33] <%GabeSweetMan> Whelp
[0:38:34] <%studleydoorite> it's pretty constant in this game huh
[0:38:35] <%SWFanatic> wappy dog
[0:38:38] <stormhawk9891> 1
[0:38:38] <Admiral_PopnFresh> mmmmmmyep
[0:38:41] <+KiwiRedgrave> FREED
[0:38:44] <%Agami23> imagine if you could get bloodborne on pc and just give yourself unlimited blood vials
[0:38:45] <SunsetJack> @patstaresat Offering items at the shrine also gives some elixirs back so sell your junk there often.
[0:38:45] <Treasure_Vault> Which Dark Souls had the best estus system?
[0:38:45] <%doctordinkus> what is your favorite game, patm
[0:38:46] <+polothegreatest> M O R T I S
[0:38:46] <theshillman> god FUCK THOSE HEADS
[0:38:49] <cartakus> God I hope Pat gets to 2 I want to NG with him
[0:38:50] <%G_Thunders> It’s only a problem in Bloodborne if you refuse to spend echoes on them
[0:38:50] <%doctordinkus> pat?*
[0:38:56] <Admiral_PopnFresh> DOG
[0:38:58] <topiodonk> will this be the first win for the goblins?
[0:38:59] <%GabeSweetMan> PAT?!
[0:39:03] <T_Sasquatch> Once i got past gascoigne, vials became a nonissue
[0:39:04] <shiny_prinny> contact damage from the heads is the worst
[0:39:04] <+JustToWatch> pick up your souls
[0:39:05] <%GabeSweetMan> GET DOG
[0:39:05] <Profmcstevie> "See we saw Demon Souls grass and thought it was cool as hell"
[0:39:08] <RyuuAoi> @doctordinkus Sonic Heros
[0:39:11] <$IzazaOzihaha> Grab your amrita
[0:39:15] <Admiral_PopnFresh> DOG GET
[0:39:16] <+TopTieramisu> LUL
[0:39:20] <+JustToWatch> Pat...
[0:39:20] <Admiral_PopnFresh> oh well
[0:39:21] <%GabeSweetMan> Pat why didn't you get your stuff?
[0:39:23] <%JoshManVGH> don't get me wrong, elixers being consumables does suck, but I'm glad they did at least a hybrid of Estus/BloodVials
[0:39:24] <%Axellogic> tongued
[0:39:28] <$IzazaOzihaha> Damn
[0:39:29] <%SWFanatic> Japan!
[0:39:29] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[0:39:29] <%GabeSweetMan> .....
[0:39:32] <+TopTieramisu> your dropped souls
[0:39:32] <Cosairen> monkaS
[0:39:35] <@Lion_kun> Lost the souls now
[0:39:35] <oda_flobunaga> he's nervous
[0:39:35] <cartakus> The skulls are BS
[0:39:35] <+KiwiRedgrave> you lost it
[0:39:36] <%RayReborne> the grave and souls dude
[0:39:36] <%Axellogic> you didnt pick up your souls
[0:39:37] <%GabeSweetMan> You dropped your amrita.
[0:39:38] <primaryfire> corpse run
[0:39:39] <$IzazaOzihaha> Too late
[0:39:39] <Admiral_PopnFresh> I am having too much fun
[0:39:39] <mr_saturday93> I remeber the camera being the wrost in this game
[0:39:39] <%SWFanatic> Dayyytooonnaaaaa Lets Go Away!
[0:39:40] <%tank7013> @PatStaresAt IIRC you can't run out of elixers. You always get at least 3
[0:39:45] <shiny_prinny> it's fine
[0:39:45] <didgereedoodah> the heads are the worst
[0:39:46] <%Monkeyweed21> you lost it all cuz you didnt pick up dog
[0:39:47] <oda_flobunaga> It was right in front of you, your souls
[0:39:48] <%MooseIsGoose> you never picked up your souls and dog so lost the power up state you had stored
[0:39:50] <topiodonk> dont let it set in pat
[0:39:50] <+theomnisoup> @Agami23 you can just do that from killing the infinitely respawning and defenseless npc that drops 6 vials in the dlc
[0:39:51] <%GabeSweetMan> Pat how much sleep did you get?
[0:39:52] <theshillman> pat you leave a bloodstain when you die, dark souls rules
[0:39:53] <%RayReborne> idk
[0:39:55] <%Axellogic> youll be fine
[0:39:55] <MicrotonalMatt> tdogSad
[0:39:55] <RyuuAoi> Pat is dying
[0:39:55] <shiny_prinny> nah
[0:39:55] <%octavian_wolf> eh
[0:39:56] <@Lion_kun> Uhhhhhh
[0:39:56] <Admiral_PopnFresh> I don't remember
[0:39:57] <+polothegreatest> bards spirits
[0:39:58] <soggy_mess> ahh eh nothing
[0:40:01] <oda_flobunaga> 12K
[0:40:02] <+Mrbaconator> eh
[0:40:03] <+McSoliace> dont worry about it
[0:40:05] <KaironFortressKnight> Pat maybe you should play something... else tonight.
[0:40:06] <Cosairen> living weapon
[0:40:06] <%GabeSweetMan> Eh... it wasn't that much.
[0:40:07] <%tank7013> You get a devil trigger
[0:40:08] <Treasure_Vault> shrine minions laughing at him isn't helping
[0:40:13] <%RayReborne> another mechanic
[0:40:14] <+JustToWatch> not enough to matter
[0:40:14] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> the spirit mode
[0:40:16] <pixelkenj> you can charge a devil trigger over time
[0:40:19] <+Mrbaconator> the animal on your grave lets you fill a meter to power up
[0:40:21] <T_Sasquatch> LUL
[0:40:23] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> it's gone now
[0:40:24] <+KiwiRedgrave> the gauge is empty now
[0:40:25] <%Agami23> @theomnisoup yeah but thats a grind that shouldent exist
[0:40:27] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt your DT meter is tied to your souls like soft humanity
[0:40:28] <amiavamp> You died twice so it gave your spirit back to you
[0:40:28] <Profmcstevie> No sleep, goblins loud, monster energy in my veins.....oh yeah pattyMods
[0:40:29] <%RayReborne> red dog symbol glows after getitng enough souls
[0:40:31] <theshillman> well you died twice so its gone now
[0:40:31] <@Lion_kun> It automatically went back to you since you died again.
[0:40:34] <topiodonk> you lose meter
[0:40:35] <Cosairen> use it to KILL
[0:40:35] <oda_flobunaga> B+Y, when charged
[0:40:36] <@Lion_kun> But you lost the money.
[0:40:36] <+TopTieramisu> your bloodstain is gone now
[0:40:39] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> Man, chat is dumping way too much info.
[0:40:40] <cartakus> Nevermind you lost it
[0:40:42] <pixelkenj> just that meter down to 0
[0:40:42] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> you drop that along with souls
[0:40:43] <mr_saturday93> does he have a water element magic or weapon?
[0:40:53] <topiodonk> or maybe not? i dont remember
[0:40:59] <@Lion_kun> Should someone tell Pat, the odachi has more moves than just slashing?
[0:41:00] <%sleepystardewfarmer> you're doing great! the goblins in this game are fierce
[0:41:10] <mr_saturday93> if he had a water weapon or element he could stun the enemy a lot faster IIRC
[0:41:11] <%Psych_man13_13> Maybe it would help to redo the dojo tutorials
[0:41:15] <%MooseIsGoose> by power state I meant spirit mode sorry did not mean to confuse
[0:41:15] <%SirGO0SE> this sound track so good
[0:41:20] <%SWFanatic> Nightmare Slain
[0:41:25] <rosemon5001> got lickitonned
[0:41:26] <+DatAsuna> Big yokai are why it helps to get your head around onmyo magic first because it can stunlokc them if you understand the elemental system
[0:41:28] <primaryfire> your spirit will give you +20% damage resistance, but chills at the grave when you die, so you also take a lil more damage until you claim your souls
[0:41:28] <%GabeSweetMan> I wish this game had like... 1/3 of the mechanics.
[0:41:31] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt you cant run out of Elixers use them
[0:41:34] <+Mrbaconator> i feel like "oh no" encapsulates these kinds of games
[0:41:36] <Cosairen> get dog
[0:41:36] <shiny_prinny> yeah mini boss theme is great
[0:41:37] <%Axellogic> High stance odachi can be a bit slow for groups
[0:41:38] <+DatAsuna> but the middle of a mission is not the time for that
[0:41:40] <What_Up_Duck> I think he's good for a bit. Let him take it in for a while.
[0:41:41] <amiavamp> Roll to get rid of fire
[0:41:44] <Captain_Doomsday> Quality game for the quality name
[0:41:44] <oda_flobunaga> @SWFanatic more like Nightmare Gain
[0:41:55] <+polothegreatest> spirits are mocking him doodWat
[0:41:55] <+theomnisoup> most annoying enemy in the game btw
[0:41:57] <%tank7013> @Lion_kun I don't know if he could handle that right now, genuinely
[0:42:02] <cartakus> You know nioh is not the type of game you stop half-way
[0:42:14] <StrangeCoincidence> YOU FOOL
[0:42:20] <KaironFortressKnight> Pat, you can also block
[0:42:21] <%transporterthesequel> Yeah these dudes are real
[0:42:23] <%SharkMissile> This game made me for real mad a few times
[0:42:24] <KaironFortressKnight> You're only dodging
[0:42:25] <primaryfire> remember that the block RULES in this game
[0:42:26] <%GabeSweetMan> I hate that so many enemies have big sweep aoe attacks.
[0:42:28] <EynoStiles> Pat deep breaths
[0:42:33] <%studleydoorite> jermaOneguy I believe in you
[0:42:33] <amiavamp> TBF it's not like this is any easier or harder than the start of the game, the difficulty is just one big wall lol
[0:42:34] <+theomnisoup> Why not block with heavy armor?
[0:42:38] <didgereedoodah> Blocking is really good
[0:42:39] <%Puhff> this game sucks lul
[0:42:39] <Cosairen> definitely not a game you drop for 9 months and dont restart for sure
[0:42:39] <%valriot> ... What?
[0:42:40] <%SWFanatic> Hey you can't spell Slaughter without Laughter
[0:42:42] <saddest_man> block is 100%
[0:42:42] <knight_verse> Use mid stance to guard and low stance to dodge.
[0:42:44] <stormhawk9891> @PatStaresAt Try blocking, you can block a surprising amount of stuff in Nioh
[0:42:45] <%JoshManVGH> Weapon is block
[0:42:46] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> all weapons block 100% physical pat
[0:42:47] <%GabeSweetMan> Weapon blocking is legit WAY stronger in this game.
[0:42:47] <KaironFortressKnight> ...It's not Dark Souls, Pat.
[0:42:48] <%RayReborne> blocking reduces stamina first, then health generally
[0:42:50] <+HuoShengdi> blocks are still 100% phys block
[0:42:51] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt L1 blocks 100 % of Damage !00 %
[0:42:56] <saddest_man> block is good try it ojt
[0:42:58] <theshillman> this isnt dark souls weapon block, it actually works in nioh
[0:42:59] <@Lion_kun> Gonna be real, I never switched stances. When I played tonfa in nioh 2, I always stuck to high stance. I know I missed out on some good mid and low stance moves, but i could not handle all that combo.
[0:43:00] <Jaysky> Right now chat feels like, "why didn't you use the thingamajig with the thingy so you can do whatchamacallit?"
[0:43:01] <+Savarro> to be fair I remember fucking hating that enemy in 1
[0:43:04] <%SWFanatic> Licky Licky
[0:43:18] <+TopTieramisu> whoops
[0:43:19] <+theomnisoup> It does elemental damage which goes through block
[0:43:23] <%SirGO0SE> omg he had him
[0:43:24] <kulmoth> you had him
[0:43:24] <%Djinnazz> You don’t block with shields brother
[0:43:26] <%SWFanatic> closer that time
[0:43:28] <@Lion_kun> Almost had him.
[0:43:31] <SunsetJack> @oda_flobunaga It doesn't block elemental.
[0:43:35] <RyuuAoi> GreediestPatStaresAt
[0:43:35] <T_Sasquatch> HAHAHA
[0:43:44] <+HuoShengdi> the damage isn't 100% elemental
[0:43:47] <+PMAvers> But what if we used space jump?
[0:43:48] <primaryfire> an unfortunate example lmao
[0:43:49] <%SirGO0SE> LUL
[0:43:51] <%GabeSweetMan> Pat just don't get hit.
[0:43:52] <%rekinom> Does anyone know of a guide for this game that they wouldn't mind sending me? The stats scare me
[0:43:54] <%RayReborne> Pat i KNOW man, i get it.
[0:43:55] <Albedo28> that's the real nioh experience right there
[0:43:55] <%studleydoorite> not an idiot, just an ignoramus
[0:43:59] <%Monkeyweed21> !TILTED!
[0:43:59] <%RayReborne> i feel you
[0:43:59] <T_Sasquatch> Just do it 4Head
[0:44:01] <slipdog> You're doing great my dude
[0:44:03] <%valriot> This is why i saw play Nioh 2 LUL
[0:44:04] <%Axellogic> I dont think the 1000 pulls in chat is helping
[0:44:07] <EynoStiles> i feel sorry for pat
[0:44:08] <%SWFanatic> you miss 100% of the blocks you don't take
[0:44:09] <moonbearbacon> LUL
[0:44:11] <Profmcstevie> Don't remind him of block against the enemy that pierces block StinkyGlitch
[0:44:13] <+DatAsuna> I'll wait until he's back at the map to try explaining onmyo attacks
[0:44:15] <+HuoShengdi> attacks are almost never 100% elemental
[0:44:15] <Zaphire_Saucypants> you can do it.
[0:44:16] <%GabeSweetMan> I do feel my own tilt memories flooding back.
[0:44:16] <%blankwaffle> chat is poison lol
[0:44:23] <%GabeSweetMan> This is like 1:1 my experience with the game.
[0:44:24] <%Speed1ines> Yokai outta stamina always flinch, blocking non elemental attacks have no damage perforation. Try using high stance for strong single attacks.
[0:44:24] <tengel66> this is rough
[0:44:26] <slipdog> ok he just beat your ass like a fucking silverback gorilla
[0:44:27] <Cosairen> haHAA
[0:44:29] <%transporterthesequel> I can't remember, can you break his tounge?
[0:44:33] <+Savarro> This enemy got so much easier with the burst counter in 2
[0:44:34] <+DatAsuna> @valriot Nothing happening here is unique to nioh 1
[0:44:36] <+upandadam> some of these bosses are cringe af
[0:44:42] <%SWFanatic> This isn't Animal Crossing!
[0:44:46] <+JustToWatch> Just play good and not bad
[0:44:49] <%G_Thunders> @rekinom I honestly don’t remember stats being a big deal? There’s so many PVE summon fights on the ground that can gear you out whenever
[0:44:49] <SwindlerOfProgress> @transporterthesequel Nah. Not as far as I know, anyway
[0:44:51] <%MugenSandan> Maybe try sticking to low stance for a bit for better dodges?  That's what I stuck with when I was knew
[0:44:54] <RyuuAoi> Reminds me of fighting Lothric Prince last night
[0:44:54] <SunsetJack> You need to kill the tongue guy sadly.
[0:44:55] <%GabeSweetMan> Is this the pc version?
[0:44:56] <EynoStiles> Pat be patience learn his moves. like monster hunter
[0:44:56] <Profmcstevie> Reminder that teaching is a skill and many are bad at it pattyHelping
[0:45:01] <%captain_thickthighs> dodge, now with 10% cash back - Sun Tzu
[0:45:03] <soggy_mess> dude you see? that one block was perfect. you can do it
[0:45:09] <Albedo28> William can dance apparently XD
[0:45:09] <$IzazaOzihaha> @gabesweetman PS5
[0:45:14] <+theomnisoup> omg I forgot the burst counters which is why this thing is alot harder here
[0:45:14] <Treasure_Vault> Can you use the drop attack to get back on the ledge, like hammer in MHW?
[0:45:15] <%Axellogic> unforunately hes one o the mission targets
[0:45:15] <+DatAsuna> You people are forgetting what pat did in the tutorial of nioh 2 in the same situation
[0:45:25] <T_Sasquatch> @mugensandan yea but shit damage tho
[0:45:50] <kinkade_77> do heals auto replenish like souls
[0:45:51] <%GabeSweetMan> That tongue is so awful.
[0:45:58] <%MugenSandan> okay but... learning tho
[0:45:59] <%SWFanatic> yay
[0:45:59] <Zaphire_Saucypants> yaaaay
[0:46:00] <+DatAsuna> good job
[0:46:02] <knight_verse> If you keep face fucking him like that, of course you are going to die.
[0:46:04] <%studleydoorite> jermaVenus
[0:46:05] <@Lion_kun> elixirs restock
[0:46:05] <shiny_prinny> 2 down nice
[0:46:05] <%transporterthesequel> Worth it, door demons don't come back
[0:46:06] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> there ya go
[0:46:06] <+HuoShengdi> to a certain extent yes
[0:46:06] <primaryfire> you can block that slap :)
[0:46:07] <oda_flobunaga> WOOOOOOOOOOO
[0:46:08] <%octavian_wolf> 1 more to go
[0:46:09] <+DatAsuna> and yeah the lick attack is scummy
[0:46:09] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> oh also, remember, you can hold dodge to do a dodge roll
[0:46:09] <%SWFanatic> Gascoigne Gaskwanged
[0:46:09] <%SirGO0SE> we bussin
[0:46:12] <%RayReborne> no u picked it up with circle
[0:46:15] <CatRidder> you earn some boots
[0:46:17] <SaltyAzteca> No you just picked it back up
[0:46:17] <+KiwiRedgrave> no you died twice already
[0:46:19] <+theomnisoup> you pick it up
[0:46:19] <%GabeSweetMan> No you just picked him up.
[0:46:20] <$IzazaOzihaha> It won't respawn if you return to the shrine now.
[0:46:21] <@Lion_kun> your dog comes back to you automatically when you die twice
[0:46:22] <+UKOrigin> I love nioh so much,  can't wait for stranger of paradise
[0:46:25] <%Monkeyweed21> oh man Pat is blind today
[0:46:25] <mr_saturday93> dismemberment is so fun in this game
[0:46:31] <RyuuAoi> I heard borking
[0:46:37] <$IzazaOzihaha> Already picked up doggo
[0:46:37] <JetpackMcQuack> ye
[0:46:38] <+DatAsuna> you're fine
[0:46:39] <%A_Mighty_Walrus> yeah just go big number
[0:46:40] <SaltyAzteca> That is good
[0:46:40] <%Axellogic> Your dodges are faster in mid and low stance so it makes it easier to avoid faster enemy swings
[0:46:40] <%Speed1ines> Odachi and Axe scale mostly with Strength
[0:46:41] <%transporterthesequel> Yes that is fine
[0:46:41] <%MugenSandan> pretty good actually!
[0:46:42] <@Lion_kun> strength, health and stamina are good
[0:46:44] <JetpackMcQuack> SeemsGood
[0:46:46] <+Drega707> never understood why you take so much damage in Nioh 1 and 2, dose armor even matter?
[0:46:46] <shiny_prinny> Stamina and Strength give Axe/Odachii damage
[0:46:48] <%Broand> Strength mean more damage, good strength build you're good
[0:46:51] <wolfen091> don't worry about stat, let me worry about stat
[0:46:52] <+DatAsuna> this allocation is fine
[0:46:52] <%Psych_man13_13> Weapons like 3 different stats
[0:46:53] <+UKOrigin> this is random guys but what do you think of dark souls 2 taking place in a painted world?
[0:46:55] <saddest_man> health need go up
[0:46:56] <+HuoShengdi> wrt stats pump your damage stats yes
[0:46:59] <%tank7013> Unless you feel like you need more health or ki that's pretty much what you wanna do
[0:47:00] <+apacotaco> Oi!  Hope you are well.  Friendly reminder, you're cute af, drink plenty of water, and know I appreciate you 110%. Gottem.
[0:47:00] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> thats all you need for a normal playthough, strength, stam, HP, youre good
[0:47:03] <JetpackMcQuack> good go up
[0:47:05] <oda_flobunaga> Just pump strenght
[0:47:06] <%Axellogic> Stats arent as important as your gear's attack for damage
[0:47:15] <pixelkenj> there's a ninjitsu skill you're gonna want to unlock at some point
[0:47:19] <kulmoth> just pump some health and you are going to be mostly fine
[0:47:21] <taro_m> How many hours he spent stating at this screen?
[0:47:23] <%Axellogic> just get a higher level gear and level your main damage stat and call it a day
[0:47:24] <IntrepidEye> @Drega707 Yes. Can be the difference from getting one shot and taking two or three hits
[0:47:39] <SainEdge> i got like 15 points in every stat besides my two main ones and it worked out LUL
[0:47:39] <%Speed1ines> Body is also health
[0:47:39] <%MooseIsGoose> it is also health
[0:47:40] <Cosairen> its hp
[0:47:40] <@Lion_kun> Body is health.
[0:47:42] <+darethsbane> stats do multiple thngs
[0:47:43] <@Lion_kun> You need body.
[0:47:43] <%RayReborne> Body is HEALTH so raise it a bit man
[0:47:44] <%Speed1ines> Heart is also Ki
[0:47:47] <+KiwiRedgrave> you need big health
[0:47:48] <T_Sasquatch> @ukorigin what does that imply
[0:47:49] <+JustToWatch> you should still level it
[0:47:51] <%MooseIsGoose> yup
[0:47:51] <+DatAsuna> more than 10 would be good
[0:47:52] <shiny_prinny> It is still useful for the health, it does multiple things
[0:47:54] <%tank7013> Pretty much
[0:47:54] <primaryfire> yes
[0:47:54] <+JustToWatch> yes
[0:47:54] <amiavamp> Yes
[0:47:55] <%GabeSweetMan> Yup
[0:47:56] <Cosairen> yes :)
[0:47:57] <%RealThiele> someone get this man an excel spreadsheet
[0:47:57] <@Lion_kun> yes
[0:47:57] <SwindlerOfProgress> Yeah
[0:47:57] <JetpackMcQuack> PrideShrug compromise
[0:47:57] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> yess
[0:47:59] <%Axellogic> Body does give you more life but you dont need to focus is you still get life increases on level. yes spear users will have more  life
[0:47:59] <shiny_prinny> Yeah if they stack
[0:47:59] <+theomnisoup> body has the highest health scaling
[0:48:01] <primaryfire> and anybody using a sword will have tons of stamina
[0:48:01] <SunsetJack> I left body around 20.
[0:48:01] <oda_flobunaga> Stats do multiple things
[0:48:02] <%MooseIsGoose> that is why it is the best and the most cheap
[0:48:03] <%transporterthesequel> That is exactly what it means yes
[0:48:04] <didgereedoodah> it is health and also spear damage
[0:48:04] <@Lion_kun> Spears are best bois
[0:48:05] <+UKOrigin> don't worry too much about it, full odachi stats, ninja and magic to points you want
[0:48:05] <amiavamp> Spear isn't just a coward weapon for cowards, it gives more health too
[0:48:06] <topiodonk> sure is
[0:48:09] <+tempestzephyr> that's very weird
[0:48:09] <neekocheeko> spear chads keep on winning
[0:48:12] <Cosairen> spears are the tank builds
[0:48:12] <saddest_man> constitution and stamina upgrade health
[0:48:14] <%SharkMissile> Yes, it really is.
[0:48:15] <%tank7013> I guess it was a way to impose pseudo classes?
[0:48:16] <+DatAsuna> it has a softcap where ti stops upping weapon damage fairly early
[0:48:19] <shiny_prinny> I think Tonfas scale Body, so Tonfa users get big health too
[0:48:21] <%transporterthesequel> Think of it as a bonus to DS stats, everything contributes to a weapon.
[0:48:24] <+monfo_the_great> Think of the weapon affects as a bonus to the stat instead of it as the main reason to level the stat
[0:48:29] <dmtjinni> Is Pat confused by Nioh?
[0:48:32] <JetpackMcQuack> i found myself rotating a lot and generalizing actually
[0:48:35] <Cosairen> paired raiken Kreygasm
[0:48:36] <soggy_mess> nah they got tons of PUSSY
[0:48:40] <%Axellogic> Id just use Kato he makes your stamina recover faster
[0:48:41] <Treasure_Vault> @dmtjinni Are you not?
[0:48:42] <%transporterthesequel> Focus on the element.
[0:48:46] <+DatAsuna> Honestly, just ignore guardian spirits until you get phoenix
[0:48:48] <%A_Mighty_Walrus> I know what you mean
[0:48:50] <Cosairen> read :)
[0:48:52] <%SWFanatic> a boar is a pig
[0:48:53] <SunsetJack> @PatStaresAt Depends on the build you want. Dog is perfect to just beat the game.
[0:48:54] <JetpackMcQuack> git gud
[0:48:54] <+HuoShengdi> my stats in nioh 2 are spread out a lot
[0:48:55] <%Psych_man13_13> you look up which ones suck
[0:48:55] <@Lion_kun> Depends on what build you want.
[0:48:58] <@GeneralSCPatton> By... reading the effects?
[0:48:58] <primaryfire> oh yeah phoenix rules
[0:49:00] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt you need a build in mind first
[0:49:01] <+Savarro> I've never changed my spirit from dog once
[0:49:04] <slipdog> you want to switch to the boar if you're a skill build or you're having stamina issues
[0:49:04] <+theomnisoup> depends on what you value more
[0:49:09] <saddest_man> health go up ki usage goes down
[0:49:09] <cartakus> That's a bull
[0:49:15] <+UKOrigin> here's the thing pat, it doesn't really matter just choose the one you think is cool
[0:49:16] <%transporterthesequel> Yeah, you don't need to worry about em.
[0:49:16] <Albedo28> hit spirit 11 and the ox heals you when you get souls
[0:49:16] <soggy_mess> Try it out!
[0:49:17] <amiavamp> A lot of them are just a bunch of random shit for the effects tbh
[0:49:17] <%captain_thickthighs> I know goblins and all but does it really matter if you dont have the best build?
[0:49:21] <Albedo28> including soul consumables
[0:49:23] <saddest_man> use what helps with what you need
[0:49:23] <dmtjinni> @Treasure_Vault maybe i got used 2 it i guess
[0:49:23] <%RayReborne> just depends on what buffs you want, doesnt have to be tied to a build
[0:49:23] <@Lion_kun> It's much simpler in nioh 2
[0:49:24] <zzNamttamzz> I like the shark
[0:49:24] <+DatAsuna> Most of them are tiny, just pick on element until you get phoenix
[0:49:25] <Treasure_Vault> Pat needs a Nioh pro in a discord call with him.
[0:49:26] <%G_Thunders> I just stuck with pupper the whole time
[0:49:27] <%transporterthesequel> Literally just what weapon enchant you want.
[0:49:27] <%Djinnazz> Weapon type
[0:49:27] <+HuoShengdi> guard ki reductions is good, it's less ki damage when blocking
[0:49:29] <%Axellogic> The problem with nioh's stats is they dont make sense to think about until you have an endgame in mind
[0:49:29] <JetpackMcQuack> you are the plinko ball in the machine of options
[0:49:29] <pixelkenj> I kept the sonar spirit for a good while
[0:49:31] <+TheyTookMyBeard> Crank damage and kill shit
[0:49:33] <%greasypete00> just stick with the dog tbh I always went with whatever gave me big damage
[0:49:35] <primaryfire> I usually base my choice off 1 or 2 effects I really want, like the +200 life on the boar
[0:49:35] <asagi_ryuu> press the start button for help
[0:49:37] <didgereedoodah> you learn which ones matter more to you and just go with that
[0:49:37] <%captain_thickthighs> just wing it
[0:49:38] <oda_flobunaga> Fextralife
[0:49:39] <slipdog> Pick the one that looks cool, the leveling system is still Choose-A-Difficulty
[0:49:40] <Cosairen> press help and read them
[0:49:40] <+monfo_the_great> Choose something you want to do, like avoid poison, then look for gear that helps reach your goal
[0:49:43] <shiny_prinny> If something sounds good, I try it out and switch back if I don't like it
[0:49:43] <%MugenSandan> The game has super cheap respeccing
[0:49:45] <Cosairen> pick the one you like
[0:49:46] <%YakumoYomi> Honestly? It was literally "don't worry about it right now" for me
[0:49:48] <What_Up_Duck> It's like, they put so much effort into making it this way, so there has to be a reason for it... right?
[0:49:55] <+PMAvers> Snake  feels like you use  if you're farming currency.
[0:49:57] <%Axellogic> Its why just go with simple stats like ki recovery speed which is GREAT
[0:49:58] <+Local16> @PatStaresAt I just go I want this stat from this guardian and take that one. Unless I'm doing a build that specifically calls for a certain one.
[0:50:03] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt By end game there are literally 100s of 1000s of combinations or spirits, armor, weapons,  items and skills
[0:50:06] <+JustToWatch> it's a combination of number go up  and which kind you like more
[0:50:06] <+UKOrigin> just stick with Kato until you find one you think is cool
[0:50:08] <%Piemono> I just picked whatever boosted my ninja build
[0:50:09] <+DatAsuna> Just pick an element and then also get the "shot" spell for that element
[0:50:11] <neekocheeko> nioh seems needlessly complex lol
[0:50:11] <slipdog> either you're a nerd that busts out the notebook and that shit is for you, or you can safely ignore it until like NG+3
[0:50:13] <+HuoShengdi> yeah tbh on NG I just tried out a spirit if it looked cool
[0:50:19] <%GabeSweetMan> All 14 of them.
[0:50:21] <amiavamp> Usually it's like 1 or 2 things that are worthwhile
[0:50:22] <%RayReborne> can we get someone to speak in a call eith Pat? i feel like it would GENUINELY help his Goblins better than chat screaming at him
[0:50:23] <andimustmask> this looks an awful lot like a fresh restart
[0:50:23] <pixelkenj> too early to fuss about, but spirits will have better passives later on
[0:50:25] <%A_Mighty_Walrus> yeah I have never changed my guardian spirit because I can't stand this part of it
[0:50:26] <+DatAsuna> In your case it would be good just to take any fire spirit and buy fire shot
[0:50:30] <%SirGO0SE> this here is a goblin fight for sure
[0:50:33] <%transporterthesequel> Just focus on the element.
[0:50:34] <%RayReborne> genuine help not being mean
[0:50:34] <heartlesshealer> I always pick the fish because enemy radar
[0:50:39] <%Speed1ines> @PatStaresAt Just focus on Ki for stamina
[0:50:42] <%Psych_man13_13> Pat, like 90% of this shit only matters in end game/ NG+
[0:50:45] <+UKOrigin> @neekocheeko it just puts things in a menu, non of this really matters till ng+ and beyond but pat has da goblins
[0:50:47] <+Shadic790> None of this really matters till after end game
[0:50:48] <slipdog> Fire Hot
[0:50:49] <andimustmask> kato is a great catch-all, and gives a ton of ki regen for free
[0:50:50] <+DatAsuna> fire damage, electric damage etc
[0:50:52] <%captain_thickthighs> Is it better to ignore the stats for goblins or does learning help. I would just go screw it an deal with it later
[0:50:53] <Treasure_Vault> Pat's hypothetical Monster Hunter: Woolie with no item/equipment gathering actually sounding pretty good rn.
[0:50:56] <%transporterthesequel> You have lighting Enchant, Fire Enchant, Earth Enchant, Water Enchant.
[0:50:59] <+DatAsuna> Elements each give unique debuffs if you stack it enough
[0:51:02] <%Agami23> different enemies are weak to different things
[0:51:05] <%RayReborne> for livng weapon
[0:51:07] <KaironFortressKnight> Effects the element of your devil trigger
[0:51:08] <heartlesshealer> Element does type damage for your super power attacks
[0:51:11] <amiavamp> Element affects living weapon
[0:51:13] <slipdog> Living Weapon is your Ultimate basically,
[0:51:15] <%Speed1ines> @PatStaresAt those elements are only during living weapon
[0:51:15] <+Savarro> Affects what element your dt is
[0:51:17] <%transporterthesequel> You're in a strong Fire area, so, Water, ideally, does more damage to them, for living weapon.
[0:51:17] <JetpackMcQuack> try it mshHappy
[0:51:19] <heartlesshealer> pokemon typing
[0:51:20] <%IronOhki> I still don't know what this game is like.
[0:51:21] <%MooseIsGoose> by the element type
[0:51:21] <@Lion_kun> There is an icon
[0:51:22] <+zanz_san> It does extra damage like in Monhun
[0:51:22] <+DatAsuna> The important thing is, any TWO debuffs makes yokai lose their super armour
[0:51:22] <%JoshManVGH> Depends on what you're fighting, but it determines what element your supermode becomes
[0:51:23] <amiavamp> Each element has 1 specific debuff
[0:51:23] <%Psych_man13_13> some studd is weak to other stuff
[0:51:23] <%Axellogic> Fire is recurrent damage, water lowers enemy defense, thunder slows enemies, wind is attack debuff, earth is more ki damage
[0:51:24] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt Fire does DOT, Lightning slows, Water debuffs Speed
[0:51:25] <%SWFanatic> a boar is a pig
[0:51:25] <+DatAsuna> so you can stunlock them
[0:51:27] <slipdog> thats the damage type you'll do when you Pop Ulti
[0:51:29] <@Lion_kun> Water, lightning, fire etc
[0:51:32] <@Lion_kun> on the weapon
[0:51:32] <%tank7013> Also different enemies have different elemental resistances and weaknesses
[0:51:33] <saddest_man> but they only apply when you use living weapon
[0:51:35] <+zanz_san> Fire is burn damage
[0:51:36] <oda_flobunaga> Water Debuffs Defense
[0:51:39] <Explodincatz> trial and error
[0:51:41] <slipdog> Oh you piece
[0:51:45] <+zanz_san> lighting is slowed mobility
[0:51:46] <+theomnisoup> fire is a dot, water makes enemies take more damage, lightning slows enemies, idk about earth
[0:51:59] <%Psych_man13_13> JUST LOOK IT UP ON THE WIKI
[0:52:00] <+UKOrigin> @patstaresat I did a full odachi run recently, Kato can carry you the whole way unless there's a creature you want to use because it's cool
[0:52:00] <Albedo28> tutorial
[0:52:02] <+DatAsuna> The debuffs are in the tutorial secion of the shrine iirc
[0:52:02] <%transporterthesequel> Lion, don't, that's another layer man.
[0:52:03] <%tank7013> Does the game actually ever tell you what the debuff is chat? I could never find that
[0:52:03] <andimustmask> @PatStaresAt different bosses have different weaknesses, some summons can shut down yokai (kato's talisman can stun a particular batty boss) or humans (mizuchi can instant-crumple humans)
[0:52:05] <Profmcstevie> Chat where does the GAME tell you what an element does
[0:52:06] <oda_flobunaga> Tutorial mesages
[0:52:09] <%Cozy90> scrimblo factor
[0:52:10] <JetpackMcQuack> wikipedia probably
[0:52:14] <heartlesshealer> the icon pops up when it happens. Other than that maybe tutorial or looking at magic scrolls???
[0:52:16] <%transporterthesequel> We talkin just about Living Weapon here.
[0:52:16] <%RayReborne> yeah the amrita screen, living weapon i think
[0:52:16] <%Speed1ines> In that list you scrolled through
[0:52:16] <shiny_prinny> Does it even tell you? maybe have to wiki
[0:52:18] <%zeroarturia> like electric attacks debuff an enemy to make them slow
[0:52:19] <%MooseIsGoose> I think you just have to have gotten an elemental weapon
[0:52:19] <JetpackMcQuack> or chat
[0:52:21] <@Lion_kun> Ok you are right, I should not explain that.
[0:52:21] <%RayReborne> it SHOULD at least
[0:52:23] <%Broand> But did you max out the oomfes?
[0:52:25] <cartakus> If you're surviving that means something is right
[0:52:25] <%captain_thickthighs> Pat can't you just experiment ?
[0:52:27] <%blastyoboots> does it tell you what bleed does in Dark Souls? huh pat?
[0:52:28] <+grimzanarky> grimzanarky subscribed with Prime. 
[0:52:29] <amiavamp> In Nioh 2 there's defnitely tutorials for this, but Nioh 1? doesn't look like it
[0:52:30] <%transporterthesequel> All he needs to know is what element he wants his Devil trigger to be.
[0:52:33] <slipdog> holy shit this is the guy they made the owl for
[0:52:35] <%IronOhki> Is this the Smurfs game?
[0:52:44] <%IronOhki> I see Smurfs.
[0:52:44] <%studleydoorite> did someone say thick thighs
[0:52:50] <%Saadi90> oh man. this is frustrating to watch. I'm out of here. Have a good night everyone.
[0:52:51] <heartlesshealer> Look at your upgrade tree for scroll magic and see what pops up next to what element sections
[0:52:53] <SunsetJack> It doesn't explain that. I can never find that.
[0:52:55] <%tank7013> They are definitely unclear
[0:52:56] <+DatAsuna> it shows you an icon and you fill a meter over their head
[0:52:56] <JetpackMcQuack> that would suck
[0:52:57] <pixelkenj> I think they have status icons
[0:52:58] <%Nordguy> enemy look different
[0:53:00] <Profmcstevie> He asked for where the game provides info
[0:53:04] <fimbulvetr27> Check the Status screen. I know it does in Nioh 2, but I haven't checked Nioh 1 in a loooong time.
[0:53:05] <heartlesshealer> Ooooh
[0:53:05] <slipdog> Tutorials
[0:53:05] <+zanz_san> there's an icon on the enemy lifebar
[0:53:08] <+UKOrigin> they have debuff icons
[0:53:09] <Cosairen> dojo goes over this im pretty sure
[0:53:09] <%RealThiele> insight gained
[0:53:10] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt When the effect procs on the enemy, an icon shows up on the enemy
[0:53:10] <pixelkenj> :)
[0:53:11] <%transporterthesequel> This is top tier
[0:53:11] <%tank7013> The icons don't tell you waht it DOES chat
[0:53:13] <%Psych_man13_13> its a little symbol on the enemy
[0:53:13] <+HuoShengdi> enemies get status icons on their lifebar
[0:53:13] <%Wallabri> oh i thought gief was squeaking a toy but i guess it's these lil dudes on screen
[0:53:15] <dmtjinni> chill
[0:53:15] <%ElkRiverDog> Ok, semi-joking question: did German Spy write a guide for this game?
[0:53:15] <%Broand> Chat He's looking for the element tutorial
[0:53:16] <EynoStiles> can you pull up the menu again
[0:53:16] <$Futurecity10> CANT WAKE UP
[0:53:16] <+DatAsuna> Defense down is the water debuff
[0:53:17] <%SWFanatic> if you promote chubby thighs they might become a captain
[0:53:17] <slipdog> Text Tutorials
[0:53:17] <%IronOhki> THIS IS THE REAL MIND GOBLINS
[0:53:17] <@Lion_kun> Poor Pat is getting so frustrated.
[0:53:18] <JetpackMcQuack> they need some kinda repository
[0:53:18] <SunsetJack> They don't explain icons in screen.
[0:53:19] <stormhawk9891> What do those icons MEAN chat
[0:53:20] <Explodincatz> u read the wiki
[0:53:20] <+Stormzcales_Lair> On the enemy he means
[0:53:21] <%MugenSandan> GOBLIN
[0:53:21] <%MrBorisMakarov> chat where does this information on the status icons appear
[0:53:22] <%captain_thickthighs> Crap i think i made it worse
[0:53:22] <What_Up_Duck> So wait, it overexplains every little stat EXCEPT for the debuffs?
[0:53:22] <%blastyoboots> oh the dojo
[0:53:27] <+JustToWatch> a lot of this is explained in the tutorial
[0:53:31] <pixelkenj> chat brain is powerful
[0:53:34] <slipdog> go to Status Effects in Tutorials you COWARD
[0:53:34] <%IronOhki> @Lion_kun Pat at risk.
[0:53:35] <mr_saturday93> angriestpat is resurfacing
[0:53:35] <%G_Thunders> Fextralife
[0:53:35] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> I think the status icon shows up on the enemy
[0:53:36] <+theomnisoup> Status menu in memories ?
[0:53:37] <%Cozy90> open combobulator menu
[0:53:38] <%SaiyanShoto> The dojo I think is where you learn that
[0:53:41] <Treasure_Vault> WA WOO WA WOO
[0:53:41] <primaryfire> strong
[0:53:43] <%MooseIsGoose> In tutorials look at status menu see if it is there
[0:53:43] <%transporterthesequel> Chat you're making this fuckin hard.
[0:53:46] <%transporterthesequel> Why do you do this.
[0:53:47] <theshillman> he found the tutorial and then ignored the tutorial
[0:53:47] <funwashere> goblins strike again LUL
[0:53:52] <oda_flobunaga> There should be something in the tutorial menuon statuses
[0:53:52] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Man, today is fucking gruesome, huh?
[0:53:52] <%Bt_Robot> Can I just say this game's soundtrack is the worst?  I'm fighting off a migraine with these atonal squeaks.
[0:53:52] <+Mrbaconator> @PatStaresAt are you trying to find where in game it tells you what each status symbol means?
[0:53:53] <moonmintparadise> i love that noone can really answer it rn
[0:53:55] <Shwepie> I think Chat's goblins are worse than Pat's this time around.
[0:53:57] <+Local16> Does it not show it next to their health bar in 1? I know it does in 2
[0:53:58] <slipdog> Stop cutting out our tongues because you fear what we have to say you damn dirty cowarc
[0:53:58] <stormhawk9891> Is this the gobliniest stream by far?
[0:54:00] <JetpackMcQuack> this shit is mean
[0:54:01] <%SWFanatic> psaGoblin psaPat
[0:54:02] <valerios_> target the enemy, below the health bar
[0:54:03] <fimbulvetr27> Status menu, and I think you press triangle or something. Or start. It should bring up a list of every ailment
[0:54:05] <%transporterthesequel> It's not goblins it's US/YOU chat.
[0:54:07] <heartlesshealer> As long as you avoid debuffs hitting your guy, that matters more
[0:54:10] <theshillman> AMRITA MEMORY
[0:54:12] <%SaiyanShoto> I just remember just doing it and learning it as I played so that doesn't help LUL
[0:54:13] <%Cozy90> @transporterthesequel THATS HOT
[0:54:13] <%captain_thickthighs> So is my lack of  empathizing albesim?
[0:54:16] <Albedo28> the game is fucking hard to understand. I bought it and tried it. Left off right around where Pat seems to have too lol
[0:54:18] <pixelkenj> check the wiki :(
[0:54:26] <%RayReborne> ah shit
[0:54:28] <+theomnisoup> status menu ?
[0:54:28] <JetpackMcQuack> this is my hell too
[0:54:29] <heartlesshealer> R1
[0:54:34] <theshillman> what?? thats where its supposed to be!
[0:54:38] <heartlesshealer> oh wrong menu
[0:54:39] <theshillman> this fucking game
[0:54:43] <Profmcstevie> Chat if you don't know don't guess or "I think"
[0:54:48] <Cosairen> dojo
[0:54:53] <theshillman> dont tell me they put it in the fuking dojo
[0:54:55] <+UKOrigin> @patstaresat fire is a dot, water is a def down, electric slows their attack speed, earth makes them take more ki damage, wind lowers their attack damage
[0:54:56] <%MooseIsGoose> That is where it is supposed to be. Sorry
[0:54:57] <%Axellogic> I might just open nioh 1 and check myself where it says it
[0:55:00] <+shiroyaa_> On the stats menu, there should be a legend for everything
[0:55:02] <fimbulvetr27> Check the Status menu
[0:55:04] <%captain_thickthighs> guys i think were making it worse
[0:55:05] <heartlesshealer> Sorry pat, ignore me
[0:55:08] <theshillman> @Axellogic yeah same
[0:55:11] <%studleydoorite> seems like this game expects you to pore over it's contents for days on end and play nothing else for months on end to understand it
[0:55:13] <%transporterthesequel> Check the wiki is LITERALLY THE MOST USELESS ADVICE TO ANY STREAMER WHILE HE'S STREAMING. Jesus hell man.
[0:55:14] <+HuoShengdi> Nioh 2 explains shit better I think
[0:55:18] <+DatAsuna> The real answer is, people learned it from the wiki
[0:55:22] <AzureFlame98> They actually do have different menus and options between in-mission and map screen, its pretty dumb sometimes.
[0:55:22] <%barrakuta371> psaGoblin
[0:55:22] <pixelkenj> oh no a question
[0:55:23] <theshillman> nice horn break
[0:55:28] <@Lion_kun> Okay so defense debuffs or speed debuffs are exclusive to magic or ninja arts. Weapons do elemental damage. Fire damage does dps, lightning does paralysis, water slows enemies down or reduces their stamina I believe.
[0:55:31] <+DatAsuna> it's a bad wiki too
[0:55:32] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt it is probably in the dojo on the hub map
[0:55:32] <andimustmask> element shti aside, pat is handling the combat like a champ
[0:55:32] <+HuoShengdi> I can't speak to Nioh 1
[0:55:32] <+UKOrigin> you're doing pretty good dmg
[0:55:32] <%SWFanatic> How many scrimblos can be wrong?
[0:55:33] <Albedo28> jesus hell man sounds like a marvel hero
[0:55:33] <didgereedoodah> chat consistently making it worse
[0:55:38] <+aramus123> @datasuna or youtube
[0:55:40] <+DatAsuna> meh, it's not that ballsy
[0:55:41] <%valriot> ??? No
[0:55:45] <JetpackMcQuack> yeah
[0:55:48] <%valriot> Odachi and Katana use Heart
[0:55:54] <heartlesshealer> ballsy depending on playstyle
[0:55:54] <%IronOhki> @didgereedoodah It's part of the goblins.
[0:55:55] <@GeneralSCPatton> No idea what they were talking about
[0:56:01] <heartlesshealer> they work for pat play
[0:56:03] <amiavamp> Weapons scale with 3 different stats
[0:56:03] <HoboFlea> You're playing correctly Pat.
[0:56:03] <Cosairen> you're always open to getting a spear
[0:56:03] <Treasure_Vault> That was a typo, they meant baldsy
[0:56:06] <churropoppa> no it doesn't
[0:56:06] <+SilverDevilfish> Eventually the second weapon just becomes a stick for weapon set bonuses anyway
[0:56:07] <Hamborgini> every weapon scales with three stats
[0:56:07] <+UKOrigin> I just did odachi the whole time
[0:56:08] <AzureFlame98> Each weapon scales off 3 stats.
[0:56:09] <%RayReborne> Odachi STRENGTH who said heart? thats wrong
[0:56:11] <%Axellogic> The weapon's level and rarity does way more for damage than your base stats
[0:56:12] <+bloodrune8864> odachi can be plenty quick in low stance
[0:56:13] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt All weapons have a primary stat and 2 secondary stats.
[0:56:13] <KaironFortressKnight> Weapons have multiple scaling. Odachi and Hammer's highest scaling is Strength
[0:56:13] <Albedo28> heart stamina and strength
[0:56:13] <fimbulvetr27> Weapons have multiple scaling stats
[0:56:16] <%transporterthesequel> PAT that's SCALING
[0:56:16] <AoiRob> these menus are making me dizzy
[0:56:16] <klx5> every weapon scales off three stats
[0:56:16] <%Criotos> all weapons have 3 stats they scale with, they only make 1 obvious
[0:56:17] <saddest_man> Heart stamina and strength
[0:56:17] <@Lion_kun> Now here's the kicker, if you apply two elemental debuffs, the enemy gets a unique stat called discord where the enemy loses all his stamina, the game never explains this.
[0:56:18] <theshillman> weapons have one stat with Big Scaling and like two stats with Slightly Less Scaling
[0:56:18] <shiny_prinny> See the 3 change to Attacks? heart is one of them
[0:56:19] <%afronooch> the true goblin is ignoring chat
[0:56:19] <PwnyB> NEW GOBLIN
[0:56:20] <JetpackMcQuack> HOLD ON
[0:56:21] <@GeneralSCPatton> 3 SCALING STATS
[0:56:21] <klx5> but they all have one main stat
[0:56:21] <+Shadic790> All weapon types scale to 3 stats. One is the primary
[0:56:21] <shotgang86> LUL
[0:56:21] <+Mrbaconator> ONE GUY
[0:56:24] <soflicar> spread out your stats so you get other benefits
[0:56:25] <%RayReborne> Strength B+, heart C on odachis
[0:56:26] <%transporterthesequel> That means it gets bonus damage off of heart as well.
[0:56:30] <andimustmask> you dont have to use the highest scaling for a weapon
[0:56:31] <%Psych_man13_13> B scales with str, c scales wih heart
[0:56:31] <shotgang86> ONE GUY
[0:56:31] <%cvp5127> LUL
[0:56:31] <primaryfire> I went dex and heart for my first run, leveling 2 stats is perfectly fine
[0:56:32] <Albedo28> again, the scaling is listed on the weapon
[0:56:32] <Samuy_JP> one guy!!
[0:56:32] <amiavamp> The recommended stats in the Core Stats screen doesn't mention that they actually affect a lot more
[0:56:33] <+zanz_san> one fucking guy
[0:56:34] <%octavian_wolf> each weapon has 3 scalers, one primary and 2 others
[0:56:35] <%valriot> Nooo, every weapon has scaling in 3 stats
[0:56:36] <+HuoShengdi> all weapons scale with 3 stats
[0:56:36] <+BuckChuckman> Each weapon has 3 scaling stats
[0:56:37] <shiny_prinny> Look at the "Change to Attack" fields on the weapon
[0:56:37] <%transporterthesequel> THAT WEAPON. Ignore it
[0:56:37] <KaironFortressKnight> There's *THREE* Scaling Stats per weapon
[0:56:38] <saddest_man> all weapon types use 3 stats
[0:56:40] <cartakus> Every weapon has atleast 3 stats for scaling
[0:56:40] <kikoeru_san> I used a big Katana and a Spear. Spear levels with the health stat so it seemed like a good match
[0:56:40] <%transporterthesequel> You are doing good.
[0:56:43] <%MooseIsGoose> You can split your level points between things so you can have a slow weapon and a fast one
[0:56:44] <slipdog> shining talk
[0:56:44] <+UKOrigin> @patstaresat it's very cheap to respec, don't worry
[0:56:45] <+HuoShengdi> 1 major stat and 2 minor stats
[0:56:46] <PMda2nd> I should play this one day
[0:56:47] <%captain_thickthighs> you almost gave nim a heart attack
[0:56:48] <%tank7013> The odachi gets a minor bonus from heart but if you want the big one that's strength
[0:56:49] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt ALL WEAPONS SCALE OFF 3 stats but 1 is their primary
[0:56:49] <%Axellogic> The scaling on the weapon is what the weapon type scales off
[0:56:52] <TheMadBadger> It gets power from 3 stats. You're fine :)
[0:56:52] <%valriot> Its not a one guy, i literally know this game in and out
[0:56:52] <heartlesshealer> Everyone use your channel points to unlock the one guy emote
[0:56:52] <%Psych_man13_13> MULTIPLE SCALINGS
[0:56:52] <Cosairen> one guy really can do it
[0:56:52] <%Speed1ines> @PatStaresAt weapons have sub scales, so Odachi is Str, heart and something....
[0:56:53] <+JustToWatch> @PatStaresAt multiple scaling stats
[0:56:53] <moonbearbacon> are we the goblins?
[0:56:54] <klx5> pat it says on screen the three stats it scales with
[0:56:57] <JetpackMcQuack> we can do this
[0:56:58] <luftraumm1> are the goblins winning today eh?
[0:56:59] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> though it doesn't matter if you have to level two stats to be able to use two different weapons
[0:57:00] <%SWFanatic> I think this game is playing you
[0:57:00] <%valriot> Strength is ALSO on Katana
[0:57:01] <saddest_man> stamina is also a damage stat
[0:57:01] <+HuoShengdi> Axes and Odachi are both strength primary
[0:57:02] <AzureFlame98> Ultimately your numbers get so high in this game your actual character stats make up a fairly small portion of your outputted damage anyways.
[0:57:07] <slipdog> You look like a mangled ballsack
[0:57:11] <Cosairen> i can fix him :)
[0:57:16] <topiodonk> its what i used
[0:57:18] <+UKOrigin> chat is giving a lot of superfluous information that just overloads him
[0:57:19] <theshillman> do you see where it says Change to attack (stamina)? that means stamina makes damage go up
[0:57:19] <%valriot> Dual Sword are ALSO Heart and Strength
[0:57:21] <oda_flobunaga> Axes and Odachi have the same Primary but different secondary and tertiary
[0:57:21] <@GeneralSCPatton> Read the scaling
[0:57:22] <saddest_man> both of those could work together
[0:57:23] <+ElReaping> Fist is best weapon
[0:57:24] <%Speed1ines> Odachi and duel swords is totally viable
[0:57:25] <%transporterthesequel> Yeah, you would need to go Strength/Skill for DS/Odachi.
[0:57:25] <+DatAsuna> that's for quality builds that do everything yeah
[0:57:30] <%valriot> No, every weapon scales in 3 stats
[0:57:30] <shiny_prinny> You could have made heart one of your main stats and went Dual Sword + Odach
[0:57:31] <%Axellogic> Each weapon scales off 3 stats
[0:57:32] <Zaphire_Saucypants> looks like chat was the goblins you made along the way...all dis time.
[0:57:36] <%SirGO0SE> i can hear the clamoring of pats goblins in the back of his mind
[0:57:38] <%Psych_man13_13> Pat it says "mainly" not only
[0:57:40] <%SWFanatic> Amazing chest ahead
[0:57:40] <+DatAsuna> You could use them anyway it would just be suboptimal
[0:57:41] <%SirGO0SE> its going to be okay big guy
[0:57:41] <amiavamp> It's on the weapon
[0:57:41] <+SilverDevilfish> Yes it does
[0:57:42] <+theomnisoup> You could do odachi and spears
[0:57:42] <Hamborgini> yes it does
[0:57:42] <Albedo28> it says it on the weapon
[0:57:43] <%Speed1ines> It says on the actually weapon
[0:57:43] <%valriot> It says it on the weapon
[0:57:45] <AoiRob> you can see the scaling letter on the weapon itself
[0:57:45] <pixelkenj> Honestly my main weapon was Odachi but I swapped my secondary weapon around for fun and variety
[0:57:47] <Albedo28> the tooltip is useless
[0:57:47] <shiny_prinny> It says it on the weapon itself
[0:57:47] <+SilverDevilfish> look at the bottom of the weapon
[0:57:47] <%A_Mighty_Walrus> On the weapon
[0:57:48] <shotgang86> Pat, if its not one of the many NG+, don't sweat over more than 2 stats besides the major damage one and health
[0:57:49] <%Axellogic> On the weapons themselve you see the scaling
[0:57:49] <%Psych_man13_13> on the weapon it does
[0:57:49] <@GeneralSCPatton> IT'S ON THE WEAPON csbeastSetIn
[0:57:51] <JetpackMcQuack> what if you didn't know
[0:57:51] <%octavian_wolf> it says it on the weapon
[0:57:52] <cartakus> Nioh 2 says it
[0:57:52] <%SWFanatic> don't give up skeleton
[0:57:53] <%RayReborne> bottom half of weapon description
[0:57:53] <heartlesshealer> The weapons have multiple scale stats
[0:57:54] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> you can level multiple stats it's fine
[0:57:54] <saddest_man> it says on the weappn itself
[0:57:54] <theshillman> It says that on the weapon
[0:57:54] <andimustmask> the weapon itself
[0:57:54] <+ElReaping> technically you could get scrolls later to change a weapons scaling...
[0:57:55] <Hamborgini> change to attack
[0:57:55] <+SilverDevilfish> Change to Attack
[0:57:55] <+DatAsuna> You would still have usable damage on the twinswords
[0:57:55] <+Shadic790> It uses the phrasing change to attack
[0:57:57] <%Axellogic> Change to attack stats
[0:57:58] <+Shadic790> It's stupid
[0:57:58] <valerios_> chance to attack  (X)
[0:58:00] <+DatAsuna> just not minmaxed
[0:58:01] <Albedo28> change to attack is scaling info
[0:58:01] <+JustToWatch> there are 3 letters
[0:58:01] <+bloodrune8864> it says the scaling on the weapon Pat
[0:58:03] <topiodonk> yes
[0:58:04] <%SaiyanShoto> It doesn't say it but you can see it when you level up
[0:58:07] <%transporterthesequel> Goddammit that's DIABLO'S CHAT. Bonus stat. NOt it's BASE SHIT.
[0:58:08] <+UKOrigin> the stat it just says its MAIN stat
[0:58:08] <amiavamp> Good ol translation
[0:58:10] <+Shadic790> Yeah, it's dumb
[0:58:10] <KaironFortressKnight> Change to attack means scaling
[0:58:11] <saddest_man> change to attack is scaling
[0:58:12] <pixelkenj> clear translation
[0:58:13] <Zaphire_Saucypants> this seems really obtuse.
[0:58:13] <Profmcstevie> The three grades
[0:58:14] <%Axellogic> YEs the translation in Nioh 1 is terrible for some of the stats
[0:58:14] <%valriot> Yeah this is why Nioh 2 is better btw
[0:58:14] <primaryfire> most weapons don't have 2 weapons attached to their stat
[0:58:15] <%G_Thunders> Odachi and dual swords have crossover, the tooltip is written badly
[0:58:15] <shotgang86> if anything you can always respec in this game
[0:58:16] <theshillman> Change to attack is the scaling letter
[0:58:16] <andimustmask> the localization is fucking awful in places for nioh
[0:58:19] <PwnyB> Stat screen shows the primary, each weapon type has two more lesser.
[0:58:20] <SunsetJack> You do you on weapon choices. I use sword (heart) and kusuragami (dex). At one point, you can change weapon scaling, so don't worry.
[0:58:20] <%PatNTheHat> Yeah that is hyper unclear
[0:58:25] <kikoeru_san> Yeah it's honestly best to go Odachi and what the fuck else you want. be kind to yourself man
[0:58:27] <%Axellogic> Youl get more dual swords
[0:58:28] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt it says it on the weapon. EVERY WEAPON.  We can't help you if you don't read because the meuns are intimidating
[0:58:30] <%justcallmebobplease> YOU CAN DO IT PAT, KEEP AT IT
[0:58:30] <primaryfire> you'll find a million, it's ok
[0:58:33] <%Speed1ines> you find more
[0:58:34] <andimustmask> you can find more, or  smith them
[0:58:35] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> you'll get more it's ok
[0:58:36] <%transporterthesequel> Weapons have a CHANCE to scale with other stats. It is NOT GUARANTEED.
[0:58:38] <JetpackMcQuack> go cut the bad guys
[0:58:40] <+HuoShengdi> Nioh 1's localization isn't as good as 2
[0:58:41] <+DatAsuna> Just don't worry about it
[0:58:41] <didgereedoodah> you will get many more
[0:58:42] <%transporterthesequel> The Status screen is RIGHT.
[0:58:43] <cs0402196> man this game's a mess
[0:58:45] <heartlesshealer> "change to attack" is the scaling. It's just worded way too specifically
[0:58:46] <shiny_prinny> It's why building across multiple stats is valid
[0:58:47] <+UKOrigin> you can use any tbh and be fine
[0:58:48] <$realm_forge> This is why I just stick to Skyrim
[0:58:51] <fimbulvetr27> Weapons don't have stat requirements, Pat
[0:58:52] <+DatAsuna> You'll lock a good dualsword when you find it
[0:58:53] <Zaphire_Saucypants> neurons firing so fuckin fast. Be kind to yourself, Pat.
[0:58:54] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> splitting your stats is not a big deal here
[0:59:00] <%Psych_man13_13> IT DOSENT MATTER RIGHT NOW
[0:59:00] <%Axellogic> You dont need to worry about your stats cause they dont affect as much as you think they do
[0:59:02] <%RayReborne> It means if you raiss other stats, your main stat scaling doesn't suffer
[0:59:03] <didgereedoodah> splitting stats is good in this game
[0:59:03] <%valriot> No not really
[0:59:03] <shotgang86> focus on strength, ki and health and you will be ok
[0:59:04] <pixelkenj> dont obey the Minmax Goblin
[0:59:04] <%SWFanatic> maybe its the game that is fighting the goblins, not pat
[0:59:05] <%Speed1ines> Stats have secondary effects beside damage, so It'll round out on other things
[0:59:06] <Cosairen> huh
[0:59:06] <+DatAsuna> not much, only some
[0:59:07] <+theomnisoup> no
[0:59:07] <saddest_man> no
[0:59:07] <+Shadic790> No. The primary is strength
[0:59:08] <amiavamp> You can use a stat that's great for one and weak for another and just use 1 weapon more than the other except in situations where the other weapon is better
[0:59:09] <shiny_prinny> only marginally so
[0:59:10] <oda_flobunaga> No
[0:59:11] <slipdog> Its not as harsh as dark souls in that regard
[0:59:14] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> stop worrying about min max for a normal playthrough, just play with that is fun for you
[0:59:14] <Albedo28> nope. level of the weapon and familiarity matter more than scaling a lot
[0:59:14] <primaryfire> most stats do not have 2 weapons attached to them, the game is balanced around it
[0:59:16] <Hamborgini> leveling stats equally doesn't really hurt you that much, if at all
[0:59:16] <+DatAsuna> The difference is minor
[0:59:17] <soflicar> No
[0:59:18] <Boya1995> Fire is dot, water is defence down, wind is attack down, lighting is speed down, earth is stamina? down, stacking two diferent elemental statuses on the same enemy leads to the super debuff "discord"
[0:59:20] <%Broand> It's gitaroo man!
[0:59:21] <%SharkMissile> The differences in scaling at your level is super negligibile until basically end game
[0:59:24] <%octavian_wolf> it is a marginal decrease in damage
[0:59:25] <@Lion_kun> Think of it as a quality build.
[0:59:25] <tank7013> They do make a difference but they're not THAT important
[0:59:27] <heartlesshealer> less damage than actual min-maxing, but still good damage
[0:59:28] <AzureFlame98> This game doesnt really punish you for pumping every stat in the game for your NG run a lot of your power is coming from buffs and armor shenanigans
[0:59:28] <JetpackMcQuack> it's a bigger web
[0:59:29] <%Psych_man13_13> Just use whats cool Pat
[0:59:29] <%transporterthesequel> YES THAT IS correct
[0:59:30] <pixelkenj> it doesnt drop THAT much
[0:59:30] <%BinaryFireball> scaling at different levels I'd imagine
[0:59:31] <saddest_man> focus body or stamina along with heart
[0:59:32] <kikoeru_san> Pat if you like big sword and hammer do it. if you want two baby swords and big sword do it. the weapons get insanely strong either way
[0:59:32] <andimustmask> not really, the difference in scaling isnt super crazy--most damage comes from direct damage increase stats on gear
[0:59:33] <+BrogorkTheFork> Holy shit you should not need a phd in statistics to understand what is good or not in a game.
[0:59:33] <@GeneralSCPatton> There are so many secondary benefits that spreading stats a little is fine
[0:59:34] <%Speed1ines> It'll give you other benefits, like stamina and speed
[0:59:34] <+ElReaping> yes
[0:59:36] <%Axellogic> Dual swords also have strength and heart scaling
[0:59:36] <+DatAsuna> No, you're just exaggerating the difference.
[0:59:38] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt all stats have other benefits besides damage
[0:59:38] <%SharkMissile> Yeah! Quality build
[0:59:39] <KaironFortressKnight> Weapon stats is much more important than the scaling, especially on your first run.
[0:59:39] <Profmcstevie> It's not that harsh
[0:59:40] <%valriot> Scaling benefit only kicks in hard at endgame, and at that point youll have TONS of stats
[0:59:42] <+UKOrigin> it's way more forgiving in this
[0:59:45] <shotgang86> dude, this is bay damage, don't stress over it
[0:59:46] <primaryfire> it scales but not that hard
[0:59:47] <saddest_man> odachi scales with both really well
[0:59:48] <+DatAsuna> It has some influence but not as big as you expect
[0:59:48] <Cosairen> every weapon is a quality weapon
[0:59:48] <heartlesshealer> it counts all three
[0:59:50] <shotgang86> *baby
[0:59:51] <%A_Mighty_Walrus> It depends on the weapon too since they can have attack buffs already on them
[0:59:51] <+theomnisoup> scaling doesn't matter too much until endgame
[0:59:58] <amiavamp> Heavier armor gives better block so it should be pretty good
[1:00:00] <slipdog> Its worth it to have more fun
[1:00:05] <%Axellogic> Dual swords scale off Skill, heart and strength
[1:00:07] <EynoStiles> its better
[1:00:08] <%JoshManVGH> I did Odachi Axe, so I always won our on STR and STAM
[1:00:09] <pixelkenj> focus on technique over optimized damage
[1:00:10] <ToneBacas> base?
[1:00:10] <Zaphire_Saucypants> they meant baby
[1:00:10] <%transporterthesequel> DUDE just let him do what he understands, ya'll talkin out your ass.
[1:00:11] <luftraumm1> seems to me that this game is mostly quality builds
[1:00:13] <%SWFanatic> what is ligma damage?
[1:00:13] <+DatAsuna> typo of baby I assume
[1:00:15] <shotgang86> BABY, I meant BABY
[1:00:16] <slipdog> right now you're technically dealing BOFA damage
[1:00:17] <primaryfire> keep in mind that most stats do not have 2 weapons attached to them
[1:00:22] <%Broand> it's similar to harbor damage
[1:00:22] <Thepothero> and that s the goblins for this in my eye the constant gear upkeep
[1:00:24] <+Shadic790> I didn't learn any of this stuff until post game lol
[1:00:24] <topiodonk> thats why i always go quality build on a new souls game, to just try stuff
[1:00:24] <Profmcstevie> Bae damage, when you do so much damage your wife loves it
[1:00:24] <Albedo28> nope
[1:00:24] <kikoeru_san> man this game's menus and screens suck ass, don't feel bad about it man
[1:00:25] <heartlesshealer> you can ignore it as long as you upgrade the weapons you like
[1:00:29] <andimustmask> the difference in scaling stats isnt huge
[1:00:29] <Albedo28> just gives grades
[1:00:29] <saddest_man> no
[1:00:30] <%tank7013> Unfortunately no
[1:00:30] <shiny_prinny> It's just a letter rank
[1:00:32] <%octavian_wolf> not directly, like Dark Souls
[1:00:35] <+theomnisoup> nope
[1:00:36] <saddest_man> it doesn't tell you
[1:00:37] <Profmcstevie> Just a grade
[1:00:38] <oda_flobunaga> When you level, yes
[1:00:38] <+HuoShengdi> later in the game you can change the primary scaling stat at the blacksmith
[1:00:39] <KaironFortressKnight> Nope just a rank
[1:00:40] <+DatAsuna> Nope and nioh 2 doesn't either
[1:00:40] <%MooseIsGoose> It does not in nioh 1
[1:00:40] <%Axellogic> Its not super clear its just a letter they do have discrete values though
[1:00:40] <heartlesshealer> just letters
[1:00:40] <+bloodrune8864> It does in the status screen
[1:00:41] <soggy_mess> Bae dmg
[1:00:41] <%RayReborne> if we had a Plague type person to call and talk this out this would come across WAY less confusing. genuinely, because chat screaming at once isnt really helping
[1:00:41] <+UKOrigin> @patstaresat the level of the gear matters way more than stats, I pretty much went like 60 stamina and 99 strength and did so much dps lol
[1:00:44] <fimbulvetr27> You can check when you level up a stat at the shrone
[1:00:48] <fimbulvetr27> *shrine
[1:00:49] <theshillman> yeah when you level up yo get the exact number for yur equipped item
[1:00:50] <%transporterthesequel> Think of it like this. Odachi will always have S level scaling in Strength. Every Odachi
[1:00:50] <kikoeru_san> nope it's some dark souls
[1:00:50] <%JoshManVGH> When you level up it's more clear how much per point.
[1:00:50] <What_Up_Duck> fucking "moderate increase" nonsense
[1:00:53] <Bonebagmel> Better damage, that's all you get
[1:00:54] <kikoeru_san> but worse
[1:00:55] <+HuoShengdi> so you can change the primary stat on your dual swords to strength
[1:00:56] <soflicar> when you level you see how much it goes up
[1:00:56] <%tank7013> Absolutely not. The difference isn't that large
[1:01:01] <slipdog> Attack = Attack Multiplier + Scaling + Familiarity. idk if it tells you the specifics
[1:01:05] <+JustToWatch> @PatStaresAt there's a stat screen that gives you the total number for the weapon, but you don't see it for the individual stats
[1:01:05] <saddest_man> when you level up you see the how much is added to the total
[1:01:06] <pixelkenj> reset your stats later and find out :)
[1:01:06] <heartlesshealer> you can only notice it when you're changing your stats
[1:01:06] <%Axellogic> No your strength will hardly affect th weapon with its scaling its very minor
[1:01:06] <andimustmask> the stat-scaling for damage isnt super steep
[1:01:06] <+bloodrune8864> indirectly mind you
[1:01:07] <luftraumm1> you can check when leveling up I guess
[1:01:07] <+ZackTheGnomeChild> looking cool pat! big and strong!
[1:01:10] <Boya1995> since every wepon type scales with multiple stats it's generaly a good idea to spread you levels between a few stats since only dumping into the main stat leads to diminishing returns very quickly
[1:01:12] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt When you level a stat, you can see damage numbers go up
[1:01:12] <KaironFortressKnight> No the difference isn't that big
[1:01:14] <%baka_sugoi> DA GOBLINS psaGoblin
[1:01:14] <Thepothero> to complain lmao
[1:01:15] <+Qexec> Damage scaling is not nearly as strong in this game
[1:01:16] <shotgang86> you are ok the way you are right now, keep focus on strength. your levels right now only matter for health really
[1:01:18] <Zaphire_Saucypants> complain away dude
[1:01:18] <theshillman> pat at risk
[1:01:18] <%SWFanatic> Phrasing!
[1:01:19] <kikoeru_san> you do not get to see Pat, this shit drove me nuts too
[1:01:19] <Profmcstevie> This game needs some formula breakdown
[1:01:19] <%tank7013> B+
[1:01:21] <+HuoShengdi> if you had 5 strength it would say like 280 or something
[1:01:25] <MikeyxStyles> it's only the letter rank but unlike souls it doesn't lie to you
[1:01:25] <%RayReborne> Yeah the mainly affects is Bullshit
[1:01:26] <heartlesshealer> complaining allowed
[1:01:26] <%afronooch> thats fair
[1:01:28] <AoiRob> wow these guys made a game with stats more confusing than dark souls good job
[1:01:29] <soggy_mess> no no, its not that drastic at all!
[1:01:30] <topiodonk> its like warframe for beginners its a fucking mess
[1:01:33] <+UKOrigin> your stats are actually quite decent till the end, you could finish with this build
[1:01:35] <KaironFortressKnight> It's your min-max brain fucking you up man
[1:01:35] <shotgang86> its a MESS
[1:01:37] <%JoshManVGH> But its like +1 for every main stat point, then +1 for every 2 off stats gained, something like that...
[1:01:38] <JetpackMcQuack> tell rules
[1:01:39] <%octavian_wolf> oh yeah, it sucks
[1:01:39] <%SWFanatic> Big number
[1:01:40] <pixelkenj> The explanations are dense as ***
[1:01:41] <%RayReborne> FAIR COMPLAINT
[1:01:42] <luftraumm1> phrasing is hard
[1:01:42] <Profmcstevie> Lack of clarity
[1:01:42] <amiavamp> You only ever really know exactly how much when you're reforging weapons for new scaling
[1:01:42] <+DatAsuna> I do think this is being exacerbated a little by dipping into the menu constantly
[1:01:43] <Voroniel> the attack multiplier mentioned in the weapon stats is the base number for the weapon, the rest is your scaling damage
[1:01:45] <Thepothero> the stats are dumb to be fair
[1:01:46] <andimustmask> the "mainly affects" stuff is a suggestion for new players--"if you like this weapon, you can just invest in this stat and not worry too much"
[1:01:46] <+UKOrigin> just keep making biggest wep and armour
[1:01:47] <oda_flobunaga> yeah...
[1:01:48] <heartlesshealer> phrasing is indeed the problem, yeah
[1:01:49] <kikoeru_san> yeah it's almost like the games you everything and nothing
[1:01:50] <EynoStiles> i think you are overthinking
[1:01:54] <Albedo28> it's definitely not good at telling you what you're actually doing with your numbers
[1:01:54] <didgereedoodah> yeah
[1:01:55] <%Speed1ines> No that guy is stupid
[1:01:57] <PwnyB> @PatStaresAt Think of it this way. The secondary stats are more for picking your back-up weapon and what pairs well with another.   You're not wrong for being confused about it though. It's big Goblins.
[1:01:57] <Boya1995> look at  wich stat actualy increase you attack the most every level up
[1:02:01] <toulon_somberjade> Basically you
[1:02:04] <klx5> yeah stats just aren't that important
[1:02:04] <theshillman> pat is the master of overthinking
[1:02:05] <+bloodrune8864> assuming you keep leveling the same way
[1:02:08] <luftraumm1> this game seems like you cam ignore most of the numbers
[1:02:08] <%tank7013> I noticed that too. They tell you everything and then leave out or obfuscate some of the most important shit
[1:02:08] <%studleydoorite> jermaOneguy ?
[1:02:09] <%Axellogic> The level of you equipment makes WAY more a difference than your stat allocation
[1:02:09] <slipdog> Thats how DS people will say SL10 is too easy, its just dick stroking ignore that guy and also ban
[1:02:10] <+JustToWatch> you're stat screen tells you the weapons total damage with everything combined
[1:02:12] <primaryfire> strength is the only stat with 2 weapons attached, realistically most players will split their stats and it's fine. this game is highly gear dependent
[1:02:13] <soflicar> yeah they don't matter
[1:02:13] <+UKOrigin> I am not stupid, I'm saying he's fine the way he's going
[1:02:14] <shotgang86> you are overthinking. focus on the damage bonus, health and ki
[1:02:15] <cartakus> The stats are for new game plus nerds
[1:02:15] <toulon_somberjade> You'll notice that stats soft cap LOOOWWWW
[1:02:17] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> more like 1/6, and yea, just push strength stam body
[1:02:17] <Bonebagmel> "Builds" don't matter until Endgame (hard mode, new game+, etc.)
[1:02:18] <%BinaryFireball> sounds like moveset more important?
[1:02:18] <TheMadBadger> Honestly, you're fine where you are and with what you've been doing.
[1:02:20] <JetpackMcQuack> hit wall -> build -> repeat
[1:02:20] <shotgang86> if anything you can always respec
[1:02:22] <%transporterthesequel> Yeah, the best resource to look at stat increases is leveling up.
[1:02:25] <%RayReborne> generally most stats being in the 20's is perfectly fine you'll have that many points by end of story
[1:02:26] <+DatAsuna> He's exaggerating, but basically the numbers on scaling are much less impactful than you think
[1:02:31] <$realm_forge> Is seems needlessly complicated
[1:02:34] <+McSoliace> contradictions in chat are not helping even a little tbf
[1:02:38] <oda_flobunaga> Builds don't matter until NG+
[1:02:43] <theshillman> if you go into the level up screen you can see what each individual stat increase does for you weapon damage
[1:02:43] <toulon_somberjade> But you need to raise stats to gain more Skill points for the actual things you need: skills
[1:02:44] <Albedo28> it is needlessly complicated
[1:02:46] <andimustmask> @PatStaresAt the damage scaling in the game is largely from buffs, gear effects and set bonuses, rather than just your stats. your stats are the least important damage scaling option generally
[1:02:47] <%Bt_Robot> Numbers in this game are huge, and bonuses don't count nearly as much as in Dark Souls
[1:02:49] <%Speed1ines> @UKOrigin He's literally said he's done NOTHING but strength
[1:02:53] <slipdog> everybody reach consensus in chat before chatting, ya hear?
[1:02:54] <heartlesshealer> you know what's fun? these dumb statue men
[1:02:56] <shotgang86> builds are only important waaaaay later, onlyif you make any of the many cycles of NG+
[1:02:58] <+UKOrigin> go big dick 99 strength and you good
[1:02:59] <%Shirousuke1989> So Pat what's worse? This or Final Fantasy 11?
[1:03:00] <+DatAsuna> Well it is a bit hard to get 920 people to say the same thing
[1:03:00] <%JoshManVGH> @realm_forge It ABSOLUTELY is needlessly complicated
[1:03:01] <slipdog> new tech just dropped
[1:03:01] <%tanarath> I wish there was a video series that explained all of this neatly
[1:03:05] <andimustmask> @PatStaresAt you dont gotta fret over your stats
[1:03:05] <heartlesshealer> love fighting them
[1:03:07] <TheMadBadger> @McSoliace Yeah, there are too many people guessing/not knowing that are drowning those of us who do know what we're talking about
[1:03:11] <Albedo28> this doesn't even feel like a goblin game that only effects pat. This game gives anyone who wants to understand how it works goblins
[1:03:12] <pixelkenj> i saw a kodama 👀
[1:03:13] <%Axellogic> You did a parry
[1:03:16] <+bloodrune8864> You pick your primary stat for your main weapon, then pick a secondary weapon that uses that same stat as it's secondary or tertiary stat
[1:03:17] <amiavamp> You have abilities on Block + attack buttons
[1:03:20] <saddest_man> skills
[1:03:20] <+UKOrigin> he going odachi, they all about beefy str bois
[1:03:23] <KaironFortressKnight> You must've bought counters/parries
[1:03:23] <@Lion_kun> Pat, has finally learned he has moves.
[1:03:26] <%Axellogic> Active skills are fun
[1:03:27] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> probably a unique move you equipped
[1:03:28] <shiny_prinny> That was your block + attack skill
[1:03:30] <topiodonk> mad skillz
[1:03:30] <Profmcstevie> I love how coming back to this has been slowly turning the goblin into "this games fucking numbers"
[1:03:30] <%PatNTheHat> Whatever you're doing right now seems to be working pretty good tho
[1:03:33] <+JustToWatch> @PatStaresAt bring up the stat screen and lot at the numbers on the right when you get the chance
[1:03:34] <%transporterthesequel> @TheMadBadger Yeah...yeah.....
[1:03:38] <%octavian_wolf> MOVES
[1:03:40] <andimustmask> weapon skills, in each stance
[1:03:40] <+dolvusman76> HES BEGINING TO BELIEVE
[1:03:42] <JetpackMcQuack> tekken move list
[1:03:43] <RyuuAoi> My dog likes your suffering, Pat
[1:03:45] <+dolvusman76> OH GOD
[1:03:46] <SunsetJack> Each stance can have their unique attack.
[1:03:50] <+HuoShengdi> block + attack button does weapon skills yeah
[1:03:52] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt you have moves, who'da thunk it
[1:03:52] <@Lion_kun> Okay Pat, if you hit start, you can find the menu which tells you your move list.
[1:03:54] <soggy_mess> U KNOW U GOT COMBOS
[1:03:56] <%SWFanatic> We shall send onto them...only goblins. Rip and Tear until it is done.
[1:03:57] <Treasure_Vault> I don't know how I feel about this excel spreadsheet
[1:03:58] <@Lion_kun> Do not ask me which one.
[1:03:58] <saddest_man> INSIGHT GAINED
[1:03:58] <JetpackMcQuack> uh oh
[1:04:00] <andimustmask> you get to customize each stance
[1:04:01] <+DatAsuna> One thing I do hate is that if you learn a new move that can go on all stances, it tries to automatically put it on all stances
[1:04:04] <heartlesshealer> yeah, you equip the extra skills you unlock
[1:04:10] <Boya1995> since you alway need to replace wepons eventually you need to look at imediate gains  and not think of it as future investments in scaling like in the souls games
[1:04:10] <Albedo28> insight lost
[1:04:11] <+UKOrigin> str as much as possible, stamina so you can mid roll with your gear and then ninjitsu+magic to where you want spells and stuff
[1:04:19] <shotgang86> man, this game has a lot of stuff going on that you only realize on NG+ because it becomes relevant only 60 hours into the game
[1:04:25] <TheMadBadger> @transporterthesequel It's so infuriating because i love this game and want to reassure Pat he's doing great for where he is and he's over-thinking but SO many people are making him worry :c
[1:04:31] <toulon_somberjade> also specializing in one weapon will cripple you, because every weapon skill tree has passive and active skills that are not tired to your weapons
[1:04:31] <JetpackMcQuack> yeah
[1:04:33] <choocheess> YOURE DOING A GOOD JOB
[1:04:34] <pixelkenj> screeching halt
[1:04:41] <Profmcstevie> so the RPG part is the worst part?
[1:04:41] <Bonebagmel> Use item filtering
[1:04:43] <topiodonk> the game plays great its just a mess
[1:04:45] <ToneBacas> yep. which is why i stopped playing
[1:04:45] <AzureFlame98> Numbers overload
[1:04:46] <%IronOhki> Good jorb there Homestar.
[1:04:47] <%SWFanatic> Paige: "Just don't think about it."
[1:04:48] <ExpressNode> Just woke up from a deep nap and that is gonna fuck me up tonight. Also for all those interested, they have the Nioh Collection on sale for PS5
[1:04:49] <%RayReborne> @themadbadger EXACTLY
[1:04:50] <saddest_man> str heart and stamin/body will get you to where you need to go
[1:04:50] <inutaihanyou123> you get used to it pat
[1:04:51] <Zaphire_Saucypants> that...doesn't sound good, tbh.
[1:04:52] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> just make a rule that you dont check gear until you clear a mission
[1:04:54] <primaryfire> exactly lmao
[1:04:55] <shotgang86> you are doing a good job man, don't stress over it
[1:04:58] <cartakus> Huh I wonder what you could do to stop your misery
[1:05:00] <+rafaelba93> stop picking itens
[1:05:00] <heartlesshealer> oh yeah the big list of things and having to re-sort inventory
[1:05:01] <TheMadBadger> @toulon_somberjade It won't cripple him at all, as someone who won using only a spear
[1:05:02] <%afronooch> yep, that was my struggle too
[1:05:04] <+HuoShengdi> Pat don't worry about changing gear until you clear a mission
[1:05:06] <JetpackMcQuack> bloodborne but stamina
[1:05:08] <soggy_mess> I love it. Unironically love the moves and how you can config the controls for the moves
[1:05:09] <+UKOrigin> @patstaresat if you can get past the goblin, equip the highest level gear of your type and dump the rest with disassemble
[1:05:09] <inutaihanyou123> it's system management but you don't have to do it first playthrough
[1:05:10] <+DatAsuna> One of the things that is  more mind goblin-y is re-evaluating your build for every piece of loot you get
[1:05:10] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt So play as a deprived and never pick anything up
[1:05:16] <PwnyB> @ExpressNode What's a PS5?
[1:05:17] <+dolvusman76> Are your gonna freak if you dont pick up every coin?
[1:05:18] <What_Up_Duck> Is that the way? Just ignore the entire part of the game until it interferes with the fun part? Legitimately?
[1:05:18] <Albedo28> really, all you need to look for is the item level for now. If item level higher and damage is close to your current, using that weapon will increase your damage in a short period of use
[1:05:19] <samcast1> Same, doesn't stress but confuse
[1:05:19] <%Psych_man13_13> you wont
[1:05:20] <Bonebagmel> you won't
[1:05:23] <+DatAsuna> It will never be better enough for the strrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrress
[1:05:25] <SunsetJack> No backseating on where to go right?
[1:05:25] <shotgang86> do it later, there is ALWAYS better stuff
[1:05:28] <%Axellogic> Missions usually arent long enough to be a big deal
[1:05:28] <primaryfire> the more you just play you'll a feel for how much or how little stuff matters
[1:05:30] <andimustmask> honestly you can just grab all items and not think about them until after each mission, and in the menu you can filter gear pickups by rarity
[1:05:31] <%transporterthesequel> Depends on if it's the armor class you like, and if the number go big.
[1:05:33] <shiny_prinny> my personal strat: change on mission complete or death to a boss
[1:05:34] <+Jakeofalco> @PatStaresAt change when you get stuck
[1:05:35] <%captain_thickthighs> would not looking at the items till the next save help? like a set time
[1:05:36] <+ultimafullmetal> Item and stat bloat is this games biggest problem, and then story/characters. Goblins or no goblins
[1:05:37] <topiodonk> you check every loot when you play arpgs?
[1:05:38] <ToneBacas> action part is cool, RPG stuff is too much. i'm not a huge fan of 'menu gameplay' inside action games
[1:05:40] <%SaiyanShoto> I just check an item every time I pick it up and if it sucks then it sucks and if it's better then just put it on
[1:05:40] <+bloodrune8864> It's not gonna be a big enough difference to matter mid mission
[1:05:41] <+HuoShengdi> the stuff you find will never be better enough
[1:05:41] <didgereedoodah> the biggest hurdle is learning which stuff you can safely ignore
[1:05:42] <neekocheeko> this is exactly why i couldnt get into nioh
[1:05:43] <+Savarro> true I never changed gear mid mission. always waited til after to sort it all out
[1:05:43] <JetpackMcQuack> builds solve problems
[1:05:45] <+DatAsuna> It will never be so much better that it was that urgent
[1:05:49] <AoiRob> new goblins being discovered by the minute
[1:05:50] <shotgang86> get attached to the weapon type, not the weapon
[1:05:54] <MikeyxStyles> chat is providing more goblins lol
[1:05:57] <Boya1995> tons of the system in the game are to disincentivice one stat dumbing
[1:05:59] <+bloodrune8864> the only time would be if you're really struggling on a boss
[1:06:00] <%SWFanatic> Bones Rattled
[1:06:00] <%octavian_wolf> YEAH
[1:06:02] <Profmcstevie> Never so drastic as to demand immediate swapping
[1:06:02] <topiodonk> yo, that overhead is cool
[1:06:03] <%octavian_wolf> that was sick

[1:06:11] <SwindlerOfProgress> LUL
[1:06:12] <shiny_prinny> LUL
[1:06:12] <+MosesUnspoken> The only items that really matter are weapons you actually plan to use and honestly they don't matter that much in NG.
[1:06:12] <Zaphire_Saucypants> nice
[1:06:13] <+dolvusman76> lul
[1:06:14] <amiavamp> The worst part about the loot system is that 90% of it doesn't matter and will be trashed anyway
[1:06:14] <Albedo28> dude, way to sell that hit
[1:06:15] <+DatAsuna> we're talking like single digit percent changes, not worth opening the menu every other fight
[1:06:16] <toulon_somberjade> Here's the thing: You can reforge stuff to reroll equipment ablities or with Umbracite, choose from a list, you can also do soul matching to upgrade gear to a point.
[1:06:16] <primaryfire> nice
[1:06:16] <SomeAsianDood> AERIAL RAVE
[1:06:17] <%transporterthesequel> Like on the equipment screen there is one base number, that's basically the gears item level. FOLLOW THAT.
[1:06:18] <+zanz_san> You're fighting real well though
[1:06:19] <%transporterthesequel> That's it.
[1:06:22] <inutaihanyou123> the players make it more complicated than it needs to be. focus on the combat
[1:06:23] <+dolvusman76> This is the way
[1:06:24] <primaryfire> IT'S FINE
[1:06:24] <+MoonObscure> lol
[1:06:25] <andimustmask> honestly you'll generally spend your time blacksmithing and reforging gear to make an item ultra, rather than finding a perfect one off the ground
[1:06:25] <slipdog> Fuck those little idiots
[1:06:26] <GarbageNirvana> how goes the niohs
[1:06:27] <%SWFanatic> @Albedo28 lol
[1:06:27] <Cosairen> LUL
[1:06:30] <+HuoShengdi> lmao that was so goofy
[1:06:30] <SainEdge> god i still hate these big skeleton dudes in nioh 2
[1:06:31] <slipdog> They do nothing
[1:06:35] <SaltyAzteca> Micromanage Souls
[1:06:35] <KaironFortressKnight> Ok so this is clearly the worst game for Pat
[1:06:36] <shotgang86> if you want to stress over something, stress over the kodamas
[1:06:39] <SirMcSlushy> Walked right on in to the mind goblins moment, nice.
[1:06:40] <amiavamp> You can get a passive that sees kodama on the minimap
[1:06:41] <+dolvusman76> just wear a bowl head
[1:06:42] <+UKOrigin> do you have a helm with kodama sensor?
[1:06:42] <+Shadic790> Oh my god. The nightmares
[1:06:43] <heartlesshealer> doing deliveries now, good luck and it's fine, finding the lil guys is annoying
[1:06:44] <GarbageNirvana> fwiw I hear the second one's leaps and bounds better
[1:06:44] <primaryfire> oh my god
[1:06:45] <+tempestzephyr> Do you need the numbers to go up if the game isn't hard enough for you to change gear?
[1:06:45] <shotgang86> only that
[1:06:47] <SaltyAzteca> You can have a Kodama Sensor
[1:06:47] <What_Up_Duck> I always have kodama sensors in 2, regardless of stats because fuck that
[1:06:48] <+dolvusman76> they appear on you map
[1:06:49] <%Broand> That's a goblin
[1:06:50] <%blastyoboots> DON'T STRESS OVER THE KODAMAS
[1:06:52] <%Speed1ines> just get an accessory with Kodama sensor
[1:06:53] <SunsetJack> Yes
[1:06:53] <%valriot> You can get Kodama Sense skill that puts them on the minimap
[1:06:53] <+DatAsuna> I have no advice on collectible mind goblins
[1:06:56] <toulon_somberjade> Divination Tailsmens are good for finding Kodama
[1:06:57] <+M0untain_wolf> Much samurai
[1:07:00] <%Axellogic> Sometimes helmets or accesories give you Kodama sense that tells you were they are on the minimap
[1:07:01] <%SaiyanShoto> This is just poison to Pat god damn
[1:07:03] <+UKOrigin> you need kodama sensor
[1:07:03] <+dolvusman76> Wear a Kodama Hat
[1:07:05] <%GhoulishCripple> pat you can get Kodama sensor to literally ping them on your minimap
[1:07:06] <shiny_prinny> they only appear on map if you have the sensor
[1:07:06] <pixelkenj> there's a Kodama radar skill you can acquire
[1:07:06] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> they appear with certain armor
[1:07:07] <SunsetJack> I did it in co-op. You have to do from point A to point B.
[1:07:09] <+DatAsuna> They only appear on your map with a specific item equipped
[1:07:09] <%tank7013> You can get an effect that makes them appear called kodama sensor
[1:07:09] <%Agami23> you can get gear that will show them on your map.
[1:07:10] <%Psych_man13_13> they do if you have the passive for it
[1:07:10] <+athuramn> only with kodama sense
[1:07:10] <toulon_somberjade> They do if you have use a Divination Talismen
[1:07:11] <+JustToWatch> some items have the kodama sensor effect which will make them appear
[1:07:12] <SunsetJack> It was terribly long.
[1:07:12] <primaryfire> they only appear on your map if you have a spirit or trinket with "kodama sensor"
[1:07:12] <%A_Mighty_Walrus> @PatStaresAt if you get the kodama sensor weapon stat they will
[1:07:12] <%AlteisenReiseZ> AN ABILITY CAN MAKE THEM APPEAR
[1:07:13] <KaironFortressKnight> You need a weapon skill for them to show up on your map
[1:07:13] <SwindlerOfProgress> They can if you have the skill, otherwise they don't, no
[1:07:14] <heartlesshealer> ONLY WITH A SKILL
[1:07:14] <%RayReborne> If you have Kodama Sensor as a buff on equipment they show uo on the map
[1:07:15] <slipdog> you gotta get the Kodama Sensor trait on a gear its stupid af
[1:07:15] <shotgang86> there is a skill called "kodama sensor"
[1:07:15] <+M0untain_wolf> Ban him
[1:07:15] <andimustmask> there's a helmet and acessory skill that shows kodamas, you might not have t on yuor gear
[1:07:15] <theshillman> they do if you equip and item with kodama sense
[1:07:15] <%octavian_wolf> Pat is right, but there is a bonus that CAN ping them
[1:07:16] <%MugenSandan> They only appear if you have the Kodama sensor skill
[1:07:16] <+pieking83> if this is the level im thinking of there is a kodama behind a fake wall
[1:07:16] <SaltyAzteca> Kodama Sensor
[1:07:16] <+Local16> @PatStaresAt They'll appear with kodama sensor
[1:07:16] <+theomnisoup> they do if you have the kodama sensor stat
[1:07:17] <%Broand> There's gear which makes them appear on your map. gear with the kodama sense attribute
[1:07:17] <didgereedoodah> there is a skill called kodama sensor
[1:07:18] <+DatAsuna> It's not worth it compared to using a guide
[1:07:19] <+ElReaping> kodoma sensor
[1:07:19] <soflicar> he would need the buff to see on map
[1:07:20] <SainEdge> i always have a helmet or so with a kodama sensor and i equip it at the end of the mission and run trough the level again
[1:07:20] <Profmcstevie> There are means, not inherent mechanics
[1:07:20] <Boya1995> it's probably better to get a Nioh veteran as a guide instead of relying on chat
[1:07:22] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt So the Guardian spirit you will want is the the one that shows you where the Kodama are
[1:07:22] <%GhoulishCripple> @patstaresat you need the Kodama sensor skill
[1:07:23] <%MisterRockett> Wait do you NEED every single one?
[1:07:23] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Accessory
[1:07:24] <+zanz_san> You can have guardian spirits that detect them
[1:07:25] <%transporterthesequel> Don't worry about it
[1:07:26] <%RayReborne> RANDOM CHANCE
[1:07:26] <%Axellogic> Its a random roll on gear
[1:07:26] <primaryfire> it's a gear trait
[1:07:27] <SirMcSlushy> Its on items sometimes I think
[1:07:27] <+DatAsuna> RNG
[1:07:28] <amiavamp> A lot of accessory items have it
[1:07:30] <KaironFortressKnight> Its on certain equipment
[1:07:30] <%Nordguy> find it lol
[1:07:31] <+athuramn> accessories usually have it
[1:07:31] <%MooseIsGoose> It is normally attached to a piece of armor
[1:07:32] <%Speed1ines> look at your omamori
[1:07:32] <+dolvusman76> Random Item Skill
[1:07:33] <shotgang86> its on a piece of armor, mostly random
[1:07:33] <%transporterthesequel> Jesus christ chat.
[1:07:34] <%MugenSandan> It's a gear skill
[1:07:34] <slipdog> Terrible, terrible loot system for adhd fornite bebes. why they do this?
[1:07:35] <Hamborgini> kodama sensor usually shows up on helmets or accessories
[1:07:35] <soflicar> on trinkest
[1:07:35] <SomeAsianDood> RNG on gear
[1:07:36] <+theomnisoup> RNG BABY
[1:07:39] <+SilverDevilfish> not enough skill
[1:07:39] <+Jakeofalco> on trinkets usually
[1:07:40] <%tank7013> You don't have enough skill
[1:07:40] <SwindlerOfProgress> @MisterRockett Only for an achievement
[1:07:42] <%Axellogic> You dont have thew minimum stats to wear it
[1:07:42] <primaryfire> insufficient skill
[1:07:42] <%tanarath> an item, don't worry about it.
[1:07:43] <didgereedoodah> check armor and charms
[1:07:43] <toulon_somberjade> Skill too low
[1:07:43] <+dolvusman76> Inadequate state
[1:07:43] <%RayReborne> Stats too low, at the bottom
[1:07:44] <@Lion_kun> Stats too low
[1:07:44] <%tank7013> Think of it as dex armor
[1:07:44] <KaironFortressKnight> Skill required at the bottom
[1:07:44] <SaltyAzteca> Check your charms, see what their attributes are
[1:07:45] <slipdog> love the combat
[1:07:45] <heartlesshealer> Equipment skill. RNG Obtain
[1:07:46] <shotgang86> man I HATE this UI
[1:07:46] <%Bluwizard21> Certain accesories have kodama sensor
[1:07:47] <%MooseIsGoose> you do not meet the skill
[1:07:47] <%A_Mighty_Walrus> at the bottom of the item it has the required skills
[1:07:47] <%Djinnazz> They super do if you have kodoma sensor
[1:07:48] <+ElReaping> RNG armor skill
[1:07:48] <pixelkenj> You dont have the right stats for it
[1:07:49] <+SilverDevilfish> skill required
[1:07:50] <primaryfire> skill required at the bottom
[1:07:50] <%GhoulishCripple> you don't have the stats
[1:07:50] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> skill
[1:07:50] <+Savarro> It's called Kodama sensor, if you don't see it on your gear it doesn't have it
[1:07:50] <zzNamttamzz> This sounds like a goblin
[1:07:51] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> you dont have the stats for that helm, look at the number in red at the bottom
[1:07:51] <+Local16> It's skill armor
[1:07:52] <+dolvusman76> Stats too low
[1:07:52] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt Skill stat too low
[1:07:52] <%transporterthesequel> You are going to fucking seriously lead him down this goddamn rabbit hole?
[1:07:53] <andimustmask> @PatStaresAt  it's possible for it to appear on helmets and accessory slots  if any of the REQUIRED stat numbers are red, you dont have enough
[1:07:53] <shiny_prinny> Stat Requirement at the very bottom
[1:07:54] <SainEdge> need the right stats
[1:07:54] <%Psych_man13_13> you also need stats to wear armor
[1:07:55] <+JustToWatch> you don't have the stats for that armor
[1:07:57] <%darklordfodder> The real mind goblins are ignoring half the game numbers.
[1:07:57] <%SaiyanShoto> You don't meet the requirements
[1:07:58] <%MooseIsGoose> at the bottom
[1:08:00] <SunsetJack> @PatStaresAt It is gear you get. Totally random chance of getting that effect. It can be on head or accessories.
[1:08:00] <soflicar> skill requirement
[1:08:03] <slipdog> you gotta meet the reqs to get the bonuses but you can wear whatever
[1:08:07] <%SWFanatic> all these menus look as complicated as monster hunter
[1:08:10] <%SharkMissile> It will most likely be an accessory
[1:08:10] <Profmcstevie> Actual skill issue
[1:08:11] <sirrice77> @PatStaresAt Kodama sensor can appear on your gear, on your guardian spirit or you can use divination talismans if you went magic
[1:08:13] <pixelkenj> i hear a baby
[1:08:14] <%Axellogic> yes enemies show on your minimap due to your eequipment
[1:08:14] <shotgang86> I took so long to understand it because its not clear what should I look at as a pre requisite
[1:08:15] <amiavamp> Enemy Sense is probably the best passive you can get in this game since it loves hiding enemies behind corners
[1:08:16] <KaironFortressKnight> Hop down there
[1:08:18] <+zanz_san> That's the best detector
[1:08:21] <toulon_somberjade> Again, a Divination Talismen allows you to reveal everything on the rader
[1:08:21] <@Lion_kun> Pat, which is worse, this or Monster Hunter?
[1:08:27] <heartlesshealer> Red numbers at very bottom when trying to do equipment mean get more stats
[1:08:36] <SunsetJack> Go up the stairs if you wan to finish the mission.
[1:08:39] <pixelkenj> I saw one in the cabin on the hill
[1:08:40] <+dolvusman76> Amrita Sense also reveals enemies and items
[1:08:40] <@Lion_kun> In terms of stat garbage.
[1:08:53] <saddest_man> The real goblins were the friends we made along the way
[1:08:55] <%Axellogic> he wants kodama
[1:09:00] <amiavamp> Goblin alert
[1:09:02] <Boya1995> Pat is curently geting pincer attacked by information overload both from the game and from chat
[1:09:02] <AzureFlame98> Special Effect Kodama Sensor. Its also on one of the guardian spirits that I dont know if you have yet.
[1:09:02] <%Axellogic> I vaguly remember where they are
[1:09:03] <%SaiyanShoto> LUL LUL
[1:09:04] <+dolvusman76> The roof of the Cabin
[1:09:05] <primaryfire> pat you gotta defeat this kodama goblin
[1:09:09] <amiavamp> The goblins want you to find their friends
[1:09:09] <SunsetJack> Oh, kodoma, my bad.
[1:09:10] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> psaGoblin psaGoblin
[1:09:12] <Profmcstevie> Monster Hunter is simple, complete armour sets and make weapon with big number. it's base level entry is very caveman
[1:09:13] <+rafaelba93> leave them
[1:09:13] <%rekinom> New golbin to squash: dont get them all
[1:09:15] <xeros720> the goblins are growing stronger
[1:09:15] <+JustToWatch> @PatStaresAt check your accessories for one with the kodama sensor effect
[1:09:15] <+DatAsuna> You can reload it later to get them some other time
[1:09:16] <Cosairen> goblin time :)
[1:09:16] <%G_Thunders> So... we’re no longer even pretending to fight the goblins?
[1:09:16] <SirMcSlushy> Could always come back with the kodama sense, but I fully understand. The mind goblins are strong.
[1:09:17] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> OK PAT I CAN TELL YOU IF YOU WANT
[1:09:17] <%Axellogic> one is on the cliff near the shrine
[1:09:18] <pixelkenj> turn off music so you can hear their ambient noises :)
[1:09:18] <didgereedoodah> you can check if your charms have kodama sensor
[1:09:19] <AoiRob> !GOBLIN AT RISK!
[1:09:20] <shiny_prinny> wait how do you know its 4?
[1:09:23] <%transporterthesequel> Remember, they hide in their bowls if there is combat near them.
[1:09:28] <pixelkenj> Yep
[1:09:32] <%Axellogic> hey Pat use that hair item
[1:09:33] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[1:09:33] <%transporterthesequel> Yeah they are dumb, ignore them.
[1:09:35] <%darklordfodder> The things that are stressing you out make me want to play this more.
[1:09:36] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> yeah it's too much
[1:09:36] <shotgang86> oh yeah they are irrelevant
[1:09:40] <%SaiyanShoto> Do you have an accessory that has the kodama radar on it? That's where it usually is
[1:09:41] <+MosesUnspoken> I never use them
[1:09:41] <+DatAsuna> agreed
[1:09:42] <Profmcstevie> Trash in my pockets
[1:09:43] <@GeneralSCPatton> Weapon scaling is basically linear, with every 3 points cycling through big, medium, & small returns. Base damage and familiarity do not factor in, and Bonus scaling is weaker than Innate scaling.
[1:09:43] <SwindlerOfProgress> I straight up never touched them
[1:09:43] <amiavamp> Yeah there's so many types but you get so few of each type that you can't use them consistently
[1:09:44] <primaryfire> you can only use 1 kodama blessing and there's like 5 so most kodama you find will be useless anyway
[1:09:44] <slipdog> throw salt in the face, whats not to love:?
[1:09:45] <%transporterthesequel> Literally only worry about Spirit Stones
[1:09:46] <+dolvusman76> Almost all of them are useful in some way
[1:09:47] <SainEdge> just go trough the items after every mission
[1:09:48] <+McSoliace> 80% aren't used ever
[1:09:49] <@Lion_kun> A lot of them is for ninja or mage builds.
[1:09:51] <+DatAsuna> 80% of those items are so lame as to be useless
[1:09:52] <+Savarro> Yeah I never used a single one of those minus the skill points ones
[1:09:54] <shotgang86> pay attention, you can HEAR them
[1:09:59] <%transporterthesequel> AS they give you DT
[1:10:03] <+Rofiarf> chance
[1:10:03] <+SilverDevilfish> Percentage chance
[1:10:03] <shiny_prinny> 1.8% chance
[1:10:05] <Hamborgini> 1.8% chance to activate
[1:10:05] <+zanz_san> the crystal fill up your super gauge
[1:10:06] <shotgang86> there is one to your left right now
[1:10:06] <+SilverDevilfish> to not use
[1:10:06] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> CHANCE TO PROC
[1:10:07] <%Agami23> it means theres a chance not to use it
[1:10:07] <%tank7013> That is a 1.8% chance to not use an elixer up
[1:10:08] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Proc chance
[1:10:08] <pixelkenj> % chance of a free heal
[1:10:08] <slipdog> Elixir = Estus
[1:10:09] <SirMcSlushy> 1.8% to not consume
[1:10:09] <%Axellogic> 1.8% chance to not consume one
[1:10:09] <+Rofiarf> 1.8 chance you dont consume
[1:10:09] <+dolvusman76> 1.8 Percent Chance
[1:10:10] <+MosesUnspoken> DICE ROLL
[1:10:10] <primaryfire> 1.8% chance to not consume elixir
[1:10:10] <+DatAsuna> 1.8% to not be consumed
[1:10:10] <KaironFortressKnight> Chance of it not being used
[1:10:10] <xeros720> i think that's just a chance to not consume 1
[1:10:11] <%valriot> 1.8% chance
[1:10:11] <@Lion_kun> 1.8% chance you don't use an elixir.
[1:10:11] <%octavian_wolf> odds of activation
[1:10:12] <%Agami23> its weirdly phrased
[1:10:12] <%Bluwizard21> 1,8% chance to not use
[1:10:12] <%transporterthesequel> Chance to not use an elixir when you drink
[1:10:13] <%Broand> 1.8% chance to not use an elixir
[1:10:15] <Cosairen> you have 1.8% chance to not use it
[1:10:16] <%MugenSandan> It's a chance to not consume an elixir
[1:10:17] <SaltyAzteca> means you have a minute chance of using an elixir for free
[1:10:17] <+HuoShengdi> badly translated
[1:10:19] <+zanz_san> 1.8% chance
[1:10:20] <Profmcstevie> 1.8% chance to not use a sip when drink
[1:10:21] <+DatAsuna> It's a gamble trap, don't spec into it
[1:10:21] <%MooseIsGoose> I think it is the chance to not use
[1:10:23] <toulon_somberjade> Basically Unlimited means each time you use what it shows, there is a chance it will not consume the item
[1:10:25] <SunsetJack> It means you have a 1.8% of not consuming an elixir lol
[1:10:26] <%Agami23> its like that one skill from monster hunter that gives a chance not to use a potion
[1:10:28] <+SilverDevilfish> You can get that to absurd levels with ninjutsu and just throw kunai all day
[1:10:29] <slipdog> Unlimited Elixir = flat % chance to not consume an Elixir upon healing PatStaresAt
[1:10:29] <@Lion_kun> 1.8% chance, do you feel lucky?
[1:10:32] <Boya1995> Numbers go up!
[1:10:32] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt Kodama Locations for this mission incoming
[1:10:34] <xeros720> 2 was a lot better about descriptions right?
[1:10:38] <pixelkenj> turn around
[1:10:41] <%SaiyanShoto> Yeah that unlimited elixir shit confused me the first time too
[1:10:41] <%SharkMissile> A lot of the translation in this game is...obtuse
[1:10:41] <fimbulvetr27> They updated pretty much all of those translations in Nioh 2, at least
[1:10:42] <%tanarath> so this is diablo 2 x dark souls, huh?
[1:10:44] <%BinaryFireball> this game is a fever dream
[1:10:44] <amiavamp> These devs must've loved the era of games where status effects were just a blurry icon with no text description at all
[1:10:46] <%Broand> you can survive not finding all of the kodama pat, it's not going to be the end of the world
[1:10:47] <AoiRob> is there a mod to fix all these godawful descriptions
[1:10:47] <+HuoShengdi> yeah 2's localization is way better
[1:10:47] <%Axellogic> @xeros720 signifigantly
[1:10:50] <EynoStiles> pat go back
[1:10:55] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> The goblins are winning
[1:10:56] <%Shirousuke1989> you have a 1.8% chance of not using an elixr
[1:10:59] <+dolvusman76> Top of Shrine at the Crest
[1:10:59] <heartlesshealer> Game really does ask you to take half an hour to look at your item skills sometimes, don't worry
[1:11:02] <Albedo28> dude, the skill names are useless for info. I feel you
[1:11:04] <shotgang86> No one can criticize Pat on this game because, lets be real, it makes a really poor job explaining its systems
[1:11:07] <+dolvusman76> Yay
[1:11:10] <%SWFanatic> scrimbo bamzled
[1:11:12] <%SaiyanShoto> They word things so bad in this game
[1:11:19] <%Axellogic> Theres a wall in the cave you can emote at and it will moe
[1:11:20] <+dolvusman76> you
[1:11:21] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt do yo want the Kodama locations?
[1:11:22] <+dolvusman76> did it
[1:11:23] <+booty_menace> @shotgang86 yea the translation job is a bit scuffed
[1:11:26] <toulon_somberjade> Though I will agree with one item that was hard to figure out: The summoner's candle
[1:11:29] <%reaver93> Im starting to remember why I dropped this game
[1:11:32] <%RayReborne> @patstaresat Is there anyone that you trust that can call in on discord to talk all this out? it would GENUINELY be more helpful than chat screaming as one at you. maybe a mod? Lion kun maybe?
[1:11:33] <xeros720> if they never did the player tests, i can only imagine how badly this game would've crashed and burned
[1:11:40] <%blastyoboots> Max Goblin
[1:11:40] <%transporterthesequel> It does. The hardest part is explaining how to ignore them.
[1:11:42] <shotgang86> I played both games and if I hadn't gone wiki diving I would miss EVERYTHING
[1:11:43] <%Axellogic> Goblin city yes I can super tell
[1:11:43] <shiny_prinny> The mind goblin Overlord
[1:11:45] <Albedo28> I wish I knew what emote would make those walls not try to crush you to death
[1:11:45] <+dolvusman76> and this area is SUPER SMALL
[1:11:47] <What_Up_Duck> Mind Orc?
[1:11:49] <%SWFanatic> Maximum psaGoblin
[1:11:51] <+dolvusman76> IT GETS WORSE
[1:11:53] <%SaiyanShoto> This one looks rough on you
[1:11:54] <EynoStiles> @patstaresat pat check the buildings balconies!!
[1:11:54] <Thepothero> Gear goblins
[1:11:55] <+Hydralord89> The radar shows where your objective is.
[1:12:00] <amiavamp> The best part of this game is the mission where it becomes Dynasty Warriors but good
[1:12:01] <+Jakeofalco> @PatStaresAt theres a lower level to this place
[1:12:08] <+JustToWatch> @PatStaresAt so is Nioh the Jareth game?
[1:12:13] <TheMadBadger> @RayReborne This. He just needs one voice that can clearly answer him instead of the Legion of Chat.
[1:12:14] <Boya1995> without a guide to explain the system this isn't realy a blind stream friendly game
[1:12:19] <pixelkenj> it takes time to care less about al the crazy systems in this
[1:12:24] <+TopTieramisu> the ominous music definitely adds to it
[1:12:25] <%SaiyanShoto> At least you're trying to beat it
[1:12:25] <Profmcstevie> Anger at the system will overcome the stress in time
[1:12:25] <%transporterthesequel> There is indeed a secret underground
[1:12:25] <SainEdge> crazy, i just equip stuff with bigger numbers and it works so well LUL
[1:12:27] <%darklordfodder> Might play this instead of DS III...getting random freezes in that.
[1:12:28] <%PatNTheHat> @PatStaresAt  Yeah I could never get into Nioh either for similar reasons. It's kinda bullshit
[1:12:32] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> And the best part is that Nioh 2 for me is just below bloodborne
[1:12:34] <What_Up_Duck> or a horde of mind goblins
[1:12:35] <+zanz_san> Yeah the dynasty warrior mission was nuts
[1:12:36] <+DatAsuna> Again, I think the better mind goblin challenge for tonight would be to just look at your gear between missions, not during.
[1:12:37] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt don't worry, Niot 2 is Sooooo much better LUL
[1:12:37] <%CappuccinoGuil> The thing that stresses me out is the missions. I kept doing side content FOR DAYS
[1:12:39] <MidnightPacif1c> tea sets waiting room
[1:12:39] <JetpackMcQuack> They treat it like a ninja gaiden level
[1:12:40] <%RayReborne> @themadbadger yep.mayeb we all spam that and it'll work?
[1:12:41] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> funnily enough starting over in nioh 2 and getting re-acquainted, but going ALL IN this time, would probably be the better choice
[1:12:47] <pixelkenj> Look at the walls in the cabin on the hill
[1:12:51] <@GeneralSCPatton> @patstaresat Weapon scaling is basically linear, with every 3 points cycling through big, medium, & small returns. Base damage and familiarity do not factor in, and Bonus Scaling (a rare effect) is weaker than Innate Scaling.
[1:12:52] <%MisterRockett> You honestly got farther than I did, Pat.
[1:12:56] <Albedo28> what the hell does rep do in this game again?
[1:12:56] <%baka_sugoi> csbeastSetIn THE STRUGGLE
[1:12:58] <shotgang86> you need someone with experience in this game Pat, for real, this game is really good but makes a really poor job explaining its systems
[1:12:58] <%CappuccinoGuil> Chat, can I skip Nioh 1 and go straight for Nioh 2?
[1:13:00] <srv4254> yeye
[1:13:00] <%RayReborne> that screen
[1:13:04] <+dolvusman76> THATS NIOH
[1:13:04] <%transporterthesequel> NO DON'T
[1:13:05] <%Axellogic> PRestige points for minor stat buffs
[1:13:05] <ToneBacas> it means more menu gameplay
[1:13:06] <slipdog> Borderlands Champion Points
[1:13:06] <%SaiyanShoto> Those are perma buffs
[1:13:07] <%SWFanatic> Your reputation with Goblins has scrimbled
[1:13:08] <+JustToWatch> lol, lmao
[1:13:08] <%Psych_man13_13> End game Pat
[1:13:09] <%transporterthesequel> Please don't
[1:13:09] <Bonebagmel> passive bonus
[1:13:11] <+theomnisoup> passive stats
[1:13:13] <%Agami23> rep never made sense to me
[1:13:14] <%Nordguy> Do Not
[1:13:15] <oda_flobunaga> Passives
[1:13:15] <%MooseIsGoose> @CappuccinoGuil yes
[1:13:16] <+M0untain_wolf> What IS it
[1:13:16] <slipdog> that is literally Champion Rank from Borderlands sir
[1:13:16] <+zanz_san> CP like in Yakuza
[1:13:18] <$realm_forge> You’re doing great
[1:13:19] <pixelkenj> prestige are cheevo points
[1:13:19] <AzureFlame98> Free stats!
[1:13:19] <%SinnerEbru> oh no
[1:13:20] <SainEdge> @CappuccinoGuil yes, absolutly
[1:13:20] <%tank7013> @PatStaresAt Doing various challenges earns you small buffs
[1:13:20] <Hamborgini> you get to choose from semi-random permanent buffs with reputation points
[1:13:20] <%valriot> Just passive
[1:13:21] <%zeroarturia> oh nooooo....
[1:13:21] <+dolvusman76> Minor Stat bonuses you can get
[1:13:21] <TheMadBadger> @RayReborne I doubt it. That might overwhelm him.
[1:13:21] <Boya1995> chevvos that give skill points
[1:13:22] <%transporterthesequel> PLEASE pat don't.
[1:13:23] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt Titles give you points to give you global upgrades
[1:13:23] <+darethsbane> small bonuses
[1:13:23] <%JoshManVGH> You can unlock passive bonuses
[1:13:23] <Treasure_Vault> double scrimblo bonus
[1:13:24] <shotgang86> passive bonus
[1:13:25] <%reaver93> Spend points for buffs
[1:13:25] <theshillman> they are passives
[1:13:25] <Albedo28> oh yeah! its the borderlands achievement system! You get small bonuses for doing little achievos
[1:13:25] <didgereedoodah> very tiny stat increases
[1:13:25] <xeros720> they actually explain all those when you beat the game
[1:13:26] <toulon_somberjade> Basically achivements that give you bonus points to get stat boosts
[1:13:26] <+wizard_of_diamonds> This is unfun and unfunny as hell
[1:13:27] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> thinks BADASS RANKS from Borderlands, in game achievement points you can spend on buffs
[1:13:28] <%Axellogic> Minor stat buffs for earning ingame acheivements
[1:13:29] <+zanz_san> rep is cp in Yakuza 0
[1:13:29] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> free stat boosts
[1:13:30] <%transporterthesequel> You don't need to worry about it.
[1:13:32] <SunsetJack> You spent on the second one apparently.
[1:13:32] <xeros720> because it was added in patches
[1:13:33] <%Psych_man13_13> the answer to most of your questions is END GAME
[1:13:34] <heartlesshealer> It's just extra leveling
[1:13:34] <Jontman42> achievements that give minor Stat bonuses
[1:13:35] <+DatAsuna> @PatStaresAt Do you remember those borderlands 2 perks you could earn shared across all characters? It's basically that system. And also it sucks and gives tiny buffs
[1:13:36] <+ultimafullmetal> Half the things are like the resistance stat
[1:13:36] <+HuoShengdi> Rep gives you minor stat bonuses for cheevos
[1:13:38] <%BinaryFireball> pat maybe just stop looking at it and swing sword
[1:13:39] <%captain_thickthighs> passives
[1:13:40] <%tank7013> @PatStaresAt Do you remember badass points from Borderlands 2?
[1:13:40] <%CappuccinoGuil> @SainEdge do I miss plot?
[1:13:43] <%JoshManVGH> You got numbers, your reward is MOAR NUMBERS!
[1:13:43] <slipdog> Badass ranks thats what its called
[1:13:44] <heartlesshealer> IT'S SPARE LEVELING DON'T WORRY
[1:13:45] <+dolvusman76> YOU CAN DO IT
[1:13:46] <%valriot> Just equip the best scrimblo, to defeat all the brimblo
[1:13:47] <TheotherKristian> De golbins are winning
[1:13:50] <+Mrbaconator> im having a good time
[1:13:50] <%tanarath> Minor passives similar to borderlands damage boost achievos?
[1:13:51] <+zanz_san> rep is Yakuza 0 cp
[1:13:59] <amiavamp> You get points for earning titles
[1:13:59] <+DatAsuna> It's a needless system
[1:14:01] <%SWFanatic> i completely forgot about that until you said it
[1:14:01] <toulon_somberjade> also there are TWO LISTS
[1:14:01] <SunsetJack> If you kill this enemy, the mission ends.
[1:14:06] <shiny_prinny> round 3
[1:14:06] <+Savarro> yeah prestige is pointless
[1:14:07] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> oh, green
[1:14:08] <shotgang86> I really, really reccomend that you call someone with experience in this game
[1:14:09] <Albedo28> big needless system
[1:14:13] <xeros720> it's shit for post game things, it's weird
[1:14:16] <toulon_somberjade> Nope
[1:14:18] <slipdog> I mean you understand the phrase Damage +0.6%
[1:14:19] <$realm_forge> you’re doing great pat
[1:14:23] <%JoshManVGH> His tongue is glowing...
[1:14:23] <ToneBacas> here, have this 1% resistance increase
[1:14:23] <SunsetJack> This is a sub mission for this one.
[1:14:25] <%RayReborne> main enemy, its a side mission
[1:14:26] <+DatAsuna> It will makes a portal that you use to end
[1:14:27] <primaryfire> the objectives can vary wildly in sidemissions
[1:14:31] <$IzazaOzihaha> This is a sub mission.
[1:14:32] <SainEdge> @CappuccinoGuil there is some stuff at the end that conects the two games, but it is not much. If you really care, just read the story of 1 and its dlcs
[1:14:34] <%reaver93> YEP
[1:14:35] <pixelkenj> lets find out
[1:14:35] <shotgang86> this game is good, its great, but you NEED to wiki dive it
[1:14:36] <%Axellogic> You still have to manuall exit but the mission ends
[1:14:37] <Boya1995> monster hunting side missions work like that
[1:14:39] <%MooseIsGoose> use spirit mode
[1:14:39] <xeros720> the orb thingy, yeah, you're right
[1:14:41] <+KiwiRedgrave> it gives you the option to end
[1:14:45] <Bonebagmel> exit point appears on kill
[1:14:45] <Profmcstevie> Fight now talk later
[1:14:45] <%SWFanatic> if you put all the green m&ms in your face you get a tongue like that
[1:14:46] <%RayReborne> it spawns an exit point
[1:14:48] <+theomnisoup> living weapon ?
[1:14:51] <SunsetJack> Yeap, you right.
[1:14:58] <%SharkMissile> Dude nice
[1:14:59] <%SWFanatic> ded
[1:15:04] <ToneBacas> mission all over!
[1:15:06] <slipdog> just go sell. All. That. Shit. Who. Cares.
[1:15:07] <%JoshManVGH> Nice!
[1:15:11] <shiny_prinny> you don't have to though
[1:15:13] <Zaphire_Saucypants> get fukt one guy.
[1:15:14] <%Axellogic> All enemies die when mission ends
[1:15:15] <slipdog> squirrel get nut
[1:15:16] <cartakus> Well atleast this suffering made me go back to nioh 1, I'm on NG++ with a shitty build
[1:15:18] <toulon_somberjade> But now you can search for Kodamas in peace
[1:15:20] <pixelkenj> do you have the pickup rarity filter on?
[1:15:21] <+trackles_64> U DID IT
[1:15:23] <%Broand> Leave the mission pat
[1:15:25] <Albedo28> mission complete, you won! Now to turn off nioh and never return lol
[1:15:25] <SaltyAzteca> Do the kodama disappear?
[1:15:27] <Captain_Doomsday> Enemies give up when you win
[1:15:27] <%Broand> The world will not end
[1:15:27] <amiavamp> Leave and come back when you have kodama sense
[1:15:31] <%darklordfodder> Is 2 just a straight upgrade from Nioh 1? How different is the world of 1 and 2. If I really like 2 and want more, would going back to 1 feel bad?
[1:15:33] <%Axellogic> Do kodamas stay active after the mission?
[1:15:34] <AzureFlame98> It gives you the option to stay but some stuff in the level just despawns on mission clear. I dont remember if Kodama do
[1:15:36] <Captain_Doomsday> Kodama still around
[1:15:37] <slipdog> Congratulation
[1:15:37] <SainEdge> @CappuccinoGuil the story of nioh isnt even good, so you dont miss much
[1:15:38] <shotgang86> I think the Kodama are gone
[1:15:38] <heartlesshealer> well uhh
[1:15:41] <+HuoShengdi> kodama don't disappear afaik
[1:15:41] <SunsetJack> @Zaphire_Saucypants The one guy was right. The mission ended but doesn't mean he has to leave the area.
[1:15:42] <What_Up_Duck> Yeah, are the kodama even still in the stage?
[1:15:44] <%SWFanatic> how many roads must a man walk down
[1:15:44] <+DatAsuna> The kodama sensor is bad because it's only dots on the compass, if you really must get every kodama, a guide would stress you out less.
[1:15:45] <%RayReborne> @slipdog dude, chill. this is goblins man, its a mess. and chat yelling all at once sucks shit at helping
[1:15:46] <ToneBacas> time to spend 20 minutes not playing the game again
[1:15:46] <%transporterthesequel> @amiavamp That is TERRIBLE advice.
[1:15:50] <+Savarro> This is making me wanna pop Nioh 2 back in and resume my fist run LUL
[1:15:54] <pixelkenj> its an advanced options
[1:15:55] <+zanz_san> I never bother with the kodama
[1:16:11] <+dolvusman76> is that a thing?
[1:16:14] <%Broand> Leave the mission pat, the world will not end
[1:16:15] <+dolvusman76> i need that option
[1:16:16] <%Axellogic> Trash items can give materials for crafting int he smithy
[1:16:17] <Albedo28> this whole game's system is a trap
[1:16:22] <amiavamp> @transporterthesequel the alternative is scraping every inch of the map until you stumble on them
[1:16:25] <pixelkenj> behind you :)
[1:16:25] <TheMadBadger> Chat, please stop shouting random stuff at Pat that he hasn't encountered yet. You're overwhelming hm.
[1:16:26] <shotgang86> kodama makes you carry more elixirs, that alone is a good incentive
[1:16:31] <%transporterthesequel> Dump all the gear that's not in the armor class you are using.
[1:16:33] <%SWFanatic> Put tiny tim in the attache case with the scrimblo whimmy whammer
[1:16:39] <toulon_somberjade> Gear can be turned into money, Amatia, crafting mats or Glory
[1:16:39] <%tank7013> If anything shit gear is still good for elixers
[1:16:42] <+DatAsuna> Kodama are just the celeste strawberries
[1:16:43] <Albedo28> the suffering never ends lol
[1:16:46] <%Axellogic> Down hat ladder is a wall where a kodama would be
[1:16:46] <AzureFlame98> Like I was hearing some Kodama sounds earlier near the bridge and I dont hear it anymore.
[1:16:47] <%greasypete00> this whole game is very Koei Tecmo
[1:16:49] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt Really put the goblins to the test and leave the mission without clearing everything
[1:16:50] <%valriot> This is a side mission too, the main mission you're up to is the worst one
[1:16:52] <slipdog> @RayReborne yeah ur not gonna get mod bud
[1:16:52] <toulon_somberjade> so just grab it all
[1:16:52] <%Broand> The WORLD will not end if you don't find all of the kodama
[1:17:00] <%Axellogic> wall with eyes
[1:17:04] <theshillman> i really wish we could have a better way of communicating with pat, yelling at him 20 seconds after the fact isnt helping
[1:17:05] <Albedo28> emote!
[1:17:06] <%RayReborne> @datasuna no they arent lol what
[1:17:06] <shotgang86> yes]
[1:17:08] <ROBOSAPION6499> @patstaresat I feel you'd be better off if you just didn't look at chat lol
[1:17:09] <%transporterthesequel> It totally is
[1:17:09] <+TopTieramisu> too late
[1:17:10] <%transporterthesequel> Emotes
[1:17:12] <toulon_somberjade> emote
[1:17:12] <%Axellogic> missions over so he deactivate
[1:17:13] <shotgang86> but the mission is over
[1:17:13] <shiny_prinny> he's not active because the mission is over
[1:17:13] <%MooseIsGoose> Kodama are just the celest strawberry all over again
[1:17:13] <+RowenCleric> the goblins are winning
[1:17:15] <heartlesshealer> oh right, you can't do the wall if you beat the level
[1:17:16] <SunsetJack> Oh what, he isn't active when you clear the mission?!
[1:17:16] <+Jakeofalco> not in this mission
[1:17:16] <KaironFortressKnight> Mission over, so it wont trigger
[1:17:16] <+pieking83> there is a kodama behind the wall
[1:17:17] <toulon_somberjade> Gesture
[1:17:18] <+TopTieramisu> because it's an enemy
[1:17:19] <shotgang86> the mission is over pat
[1:17:19] <SaltyAzteca> When you complete a mission all enemies are gone
[1:17:19] <%tank7013> It might be inactive because the mission is over
[1:17:20] <+dolvusman76> Enemies are pacified when you complete the mission
[1:17:20] <%SaiyanShoto> You beat the boss
[1:17:21] <%RayReborne> @slipdog lol. lmao
[1:17:21] <%transporterthesequel> It's a wall, it don't care about sword
[1:17:21] <@GeneralSCPatton> It WAS one of those, but all enemies are gone
[1:17:22] <shotgang86> enemies are gone
[1:17:22] <Hamborgini> that is a hidden wall, but the mission is over so you can't do anything with it
[1:17:24] <%MooseIsGoose> mission over
[1:17:25] <churropoppa> emote pat
[1:17:25] <ToneBacas> maybe for this mission it isn't there?
[1:17:27] <%Axellogic> Kodama is behind the wall
[1:17:28] <%MugenSandan> Killing the boss deactivates all enemies
[1:17:28] <%valriot> mission is over, enemy despawned
[1:17:29] <%transporterthesequel> Gesture it to respond.
[1:17:30] <theshillman> after you defeat the objective of a side mission all other enemies turn off
[1:17:30] <+Local16> @PatStaresAt Missions over
[1:17:30] <+TopTieramisu> LUL
[1:17:30] <+pieking83> but you cant interreact with it
[1:17:30] <Zebylth> the mission is over
[1:17:31] <heartlesshealer> Mission over = No Wall
[1:17:32] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt because Mission Complete
[1:17:33] <ToneBacas> oh god
[1:17:34] <%valriot> Oh my god Pat
[1:17:36] <%MooseIsGoose> you do not have to
[1:17:37] <oda_flobunaga> Yep
[1:17:38] <DirtyMerlin> Do people generally like Nioh 1 or 2??
[1:17:43] <@Lion_kun> Pat, you do not have to.
[1:17:43] <Boya1995> @darklordfodder levels are better, enemy variety is MUCH better, bosses are better, tons of qol changes, it's generally considered rough to go back to 1 after 2 yeah, still playable but it would take some adjustment
[1:17:44] <Albedo28> that is evil that it won't work if you do the thing the game tells you to
[1:17:45] <+HuoShengdi> you do not
[1:17:45] <theshillman> if you want to bother with that wall, yes
[1:17:46] <Profmcstevie> Oh that's gaaarbage, they turn off?
[1:17:46] <%greasypete00> 2
[1:17:47] <cartakus> Nah just grab kodama and leave
[1:17:50] <%Maids4lyfe> no
[1:17:51] <KaironFortressKnight> Pat the Kodamas are the most minor fucking thing ever
[1:17:51] <%afronooch> let you carry more elixers
[1:17:53] <+KiwiRedgrave> they be green and cute
[1:17:53] <%Axellogic> kodama give you offerins at the shrine
[1:17:53] <What_Up_Duck> Small buffs, like EVERY thing else
[1:17:54] <SunsetJack> Makes the blessing better.
[1:17:55] <K1llingEdge> 2
[1:17:57] <%RayReborne> drop rate increase for stuff
[1:17:58] <@Lion_kun> Kodama increases elixir count.
[1:17:58] <ToneBacas> increase elixer and shit
[1:17:58] <%MooseIsGoose> No need to get them all you are fine
[1:17:59] <+dolvusman76> starting elixrs are increased
[1:17:59] <%BinaryFireball> just fuck it
[1:18:00] <pixelkenj> item drop boosts
[1:18:00] <shiny_prinny> Kodama increase the base elixer you have on shrine respawn
[1:18:00] <%tank7013> You can give them cash for small buffs per level
[1:18:00] <+HuoShengdi> you can just pop back into the mission, find kodama, and leave
[1:18:01] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> they give small bonuses like more elixirs dropped and such
[1:18:02] <+aramus123> @dirtymerlin yes they do
[1:18:02] <%tanarath> @dirtymerlin 2
[1:18:08] <srv4254> correct
[1:18:09] <heartlesshealer> it's fine, I come back to this mission to farm trash for blacksmithing scrap, you can get it during one of those runs
[1:18:09] <%captain_thickthighs> oh god
[1:18:11] <+clevernamewhere> just leave
[1:18:11] <+dolvusman76> up to 8 every shrine
[1:18:13] <%greasypete00> it's not
[1:18:13] <+DatAsuna> It's not, because they reset per region
[1:18:13] <+tempestzephyr> you don't need to collect the strawberries
[1:18:13] <Bonebagmel> @DirtyMerlin 2 is flat out better, and there's even re-use of levels and enemies from 1. You can kiiiiiiiiind of play nioh 1 in nioh 2.
[1:18:14] <@GeneralSCPatton> More free elixirs
[1:18:15] <MidnightPacif1c> oh no
[1:18:16] <@Lion_kun> You can pick up a kodama and leave a mission and you still have them.
[1:18:16] <AzureFlame98> Kodama increase your max number of healing items in this specific region, not for the entire game.
[1:18:17] <Notorious_Mic> Remember Celest Pat
[1:18:17] <%Axellogic> Kodama increase the drop chance of elixer if you ask for he healing boon
[1:18:18] <%SharkMissile> It's so much easier with a guide and kodama sense amulet
[1:18:18] <Albedo28> Kodama give a passive bonus that you choose at the shrine, such as finding elixer more often or getting extra souls from kills
[1:18:18] <SaltyAzteca> Up your chance of getting more elixir drops
[1:18:19] <Boya1995> passive bonusses inlciding more free elixirs when you rest per region
[1:18:20] <+Savarro> If you set Kodama to elixir enemies drop way more of them
[1:18:20] <Profmcstevie> Not if you don't get hit pattyDimmaDab
[1:18:21] <KaironFortressKnight> I beat the game just picking up the ones I found along the way
[1:18:22] <shotgang86> increase elixir FOR THAT REGION
[1:18:22] <neekocheeko> this game NotLikeThis
[1:18:22] <toulon_somberjade> More Kodama = better Kodama blessings and increases the baseline Elixer refills at shrines
[1:18:23] <theshillman> kodamas increase drop rate for certain items like elixir that one guy is lying
[1:18:23] <primaryfire> there's like 5 types of kodama and each you find of that type will give you a passive buff like +15% elixir droprate or +10% souls gained
[1:18:25] <didgereedoodah> increase how many elixirs you get for free
[1:18:26] <@Lion_kun> Yes
[1:18:26] <Treasure_Vault> I'd play Nioh with a mod that cut out 95% of the inventory shit.
[1:18:26] <+DatAsuna> Meaning if you play the next 2-3 main story missions it resets
[1:18:27] <pixelkenj> check that house again, Pat
[1:18:29] <+HuoShengdi> they reset per region yes
[1:18:30] <+PMAvers> Well, it'll reset when you progress and leave the region, don't they?
[1:18:30] <slipdog> what??
[1:18:31] <+Jakeofalco> @PatStaresAt you get to pick what they do at a shrine
[1:18:31] <+Local16> @PatStaresAt They increase the strength of the shrine buffs and how many free elixers you get
[1:18:32] <%tank7013> 3 per respawn
[1:18:35] <+dolvusman76> they give you free elixrs
[1:18:35] <%Axellogic> @PatStaresAt no its only elixer drop chance
[1:18:35] <SainEdge> they give you better drops for the region you are in, you can choose the bonus they provide at the shrines
[1:18:36] <primaryfire> it's elixir droprate, not max capacity
[1:18:37] <Boya1995> 3 per rest, but yeah
[1:18:38] <pixelkenj> not the temple
[1:18:40] <+DatAsuna> No, it doesn't
[1:18:40] <TheMadBadger> The more you have, the more free elixirs you get for the current region. And you also get more bonuses like increased elixir drop rates.
[1:18:40] <shiny_prinny> you get +1 minimum elixir per 5 kodama
[1:18:42] <theshillman> ONE GUY
[1:18:44] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> they can, among other things, make enemies drop more elixirs
[1:18:45] <toulon_somberjade> You refill elixirs at shrines
[1:18:48] <pixelkenj> The one on the cliff
[1:18:49] <%SirGO0SE> its just per region? LUL
[1:18:53] <Bonebagmel> Enemies drop elixirs constantly, always be full hp, you WILL grab more on the level.
[1:18:54] <DirtyMerlin> Cool thx for responses
[1:18:58] <Boya1995> yeah
[1:18:59] <%RayReborne> chat is full of One guys tonight holy fuck
[1:19:02] <KaironFortressKnight> At the bottom of the stair way, to the right, there will be a drop where the fence ends
[1:19:09] <Jontman42> you did the mission you got everything meaningful from it just leave now
[1:19:11] <%Axellogic> Tthe cliff near the shrine under the bridge stairs
[1:19:16] <theshillman> @shiny_prinny really? its been a long time since i had to go looking for them
[1:19:16] <SirMcSlushy> It does seem like a lot of people just telling him to do shit
[1:19:23] <pixelkenj> Look at the walls
[1:19:27] <@QueequegTheater> You  need to set the weather to Wumbo
[1:19:30] <toulon_somberjade> to a baseline, they can also drop as items, but you can only carry 8 unless you spend Ninja skill points on Medicine man
[1:19:33] <%Axellogic> Opposite side of stair bridge
[1:19:45] <%BinaryFireball> game was designed to be beaten, you can probably do ish fine without all of them
[1:19:46] <%Axellogic> right there
[1:19:49] <%Axellogic> drop down
[1:19:51] <shiny_prinny> @theshillman yep, i actually didn't learn that until after i beat the game too
[1:19:53] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> so close
[1:19:53] <%MooseIsGoose> Look through the glass around the corner off the stairs
[1:19:54] <oda_flobunaga> fugeddaboudit
[1:19:56] <%Axellogic> Under stairs
[1:19:57] <+dolvusman76> drop down
[1:19:59] <pixelkenj> ???
[1:20:01] <Albedo28> the broken fence I think?
[1:20:01] <topiodonk> does bruno mars is gay
[1:20:02] <EynoStiles> the balconies!!!!
[1:20:02] <Jontman42> JUST LEAVE
[1:20:02] <shiny_prinny> what is chat saying?
[1:20:02] <%Axellogic> left side
[1:20:05] <StrokeGodMillionair> where the fire thing is
[1:20:06] <+gantz_zero> is it just me or are pat's footsteps incredibly loud?
[1:20:07] <@GeneralSCPatton> Finding Kodamas is like Kindling a bonfire for more estus, if estus were also loot that stockpiled like bloodvials.
[1:20:09] <+monfo_the_great> Where the fire shot at you. Go forward onto the cliff
[1:20:09] <oda_flobunaga> Go up stairs and turn left to go behind the building. Then turn right, follow the path and climb down a set of ladders. Turn left and the wall in front of you is Nurikabe. You can either bow to it or kill it. Follow down the path and Kodama will be there.
[1:20:11] <SunsetJack> There is a broken fence on the staircase.
[1:20:11] <%Maids4lyfe> JUST GO
[1:20:14] <%MugenSandan> the cliff of the side of the blood of the wolf
[1:20:14] <DeathByPoke7> the soul of the blood of the wolf
[1:20:15] <churropoppa> you know when door man car door headass
[1:20:17] <%RayReborne> broken railing
[1:20:17] <EynoStiles> go up
[1:20:17] <+Local16> it's the blind leading the confused
[1:20:18] <SainEdge> i fnished nioh 1 and liked it, but i wasnt blown away by it. But nioh 2 clicked with me. I still dont really care for most of the weird bonus stuff the loot provides, but i just enjoy the combat and equip the loot with the biggest numbers LUL
[1:20:19] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> the small drop next to the base of the stairs
[1:20:19] <mr_saturday93> We love you Pat

[1:20:40] <SwindlerOfProgress> @oda_flobunaga The nurikabe is inactive now
[1:20:41] <%MooseIsGoose> this is what I tune in for,
[1:20:42] <%Axellogic> that cliff
[1:20:43] <Boya1995> the kodama bonnuses resets per region anyway, just come back later when you have a charm with the kodama sensor bonus
[1:20:44] <%SinnerEbru> AWESOME weve hit the part of the stream where pat goes "what the FUCK is chat saying"
[1:20:45] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> ahahaha
[1:20:46] <+dante_must_die_exe> jesus the gang tonight LUL
[1:20:47] <ROBOSAPION6499> this reminds me of Max's chat last night
[1:20:48] <+dolvusman76> LUL
[1:20:49] <churropoppa> This is Pat's Joker moment
[1:20:51] <SirMcSlushy> Tadah
[1:20:51] <pixelkenj> 3/4
[1:20:55] <sennoh> chat is bad at words
[1:20:56] <KaironFortressKnight> Holy shit pat just fucking leave it, or look it up. You can't rely on chat for help.
[1:20:57] <+HuoShengdi> there's a bunch of misinfo in chat tbh
[1:20:58] <KeWeaHermano> Man this stream is great
[1:21:00] <mr_saturday93> Is that drunk?
[1:21:00] <MikeyxStyles> ignore chat don't know shit
[1:21:00] <Cosairen> NO NO DIG UP STUPID
[1:21:04] <+Jakeofalco> PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[1:21:04] <ToneBacas> goblin defeated
[1:21:04] <K1llingEdge> lmao thats a lower ledge at best
[1:21:04] <+pieking83> there is a way onto the roof of the bigger building
[1:21:04] <+TopTieramisu> pat's already joker
[1:21:05] <pixelkenj> one left or just bail
[1:21:07] <mr_saturday93> chat
[1:21:07] <Profmcstevie> CLIMB THE MULTI LAYERED FLOOR ELEVATOR "do you mean stairs"
[1:21:07] <%Axellogic> Last kodama is behind the wall you can get to it
[1:21:09] <+ReallyBigRocks> This is worse than Dark Souls backseating LUL
[1:21:11] <+TopTieramisu> LUL
[1:21:11] <+dolvusman76> You cant get the last one
[1:21:14] <%blastyoboots> there's charms with a Kodama Sensor bonus on them???????
[1:21:15] <+twohitgood> i don't get it. why do people relate this game to dark souls? it looks nothing like dark souls.
[1:21:18] <+dolvusman76> its behind the wall
[1:21:19] <%Bluwizard21> has he gone on the roof of the main shrine?
[1:21:20] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt the Last one is behind the Nurikabe
[1:21:22] <SaltyAzteca> Dont worry about the gear
[1:21:27] <KeiPrime> nioh 1??
[1:21:30] <pixelkenj> that was fun :)
[1:21:31] <Albedo28> there is a kodama sensor perk
[1:21:31] <SirMcSlushy> Gameplay Twohitgood
[1:21:33] <@GeneralSCPatton> This game is too complex for chat to reliably communicate about in real time
[1:21:34] <theshillman> ye
[1:21:36] <+Shadic790> You don't have to upgrade through the first playthrough at all
[1:21:36] <KaironFortressKnight> One sub mission done
[1:21:37] <%afronooch> @twohitgood it plays similarly
[1:21:37] <%BinaryFireball> good job pat!
[1:21:39] <+dolvusman76> Gear doesnt matter until endgame
[1:21:39] <+ReallyBigRocks> @twohitgood it's hard and you hit guy with sword
[1:21:42] <%BinaryFireball> you doing it!
[1:21:43] <shotgang86> I garantee to you: UNTIL NG+ DONT WORRY ABOUT LEVELING UP GEAR
[1:21:43] <TheMadBadger> @twohitgood Because shrines and bonfires and equipping gear and hitting things with weapons rooDerp
[1:21:43] <KaironFortressKnight> we did it guys
[1:21:47] <%Axellogic> Ninja hair gives skill points
[1:21:48] <Albedo28> you got some random bullshit! woo!
[1:21:54] <Zaphire_Saucypants> At this point, I think the best way to stop this goblin is to stop playing.
[1:21:54] <+Local16> If you can get by with just number go up mentality try that
[1:21:55] <Jontman42> @twohitgood because it's difficult and the combat is similar on the surface level
[1:21:55] <%G_Thunders> Yay more garbage
[1:21:55] <%tank7013> Those are the ones you didn't pick at the start
[1:21:56] <+dolvusman76> Until your second run when things go fucking bonkers
[1:21:57] <%SaiyanShoto> @twohitgood Mechanics mainly cause it's a souls like
[1:22:01] <theshillman> its very frustrating, we want to help but twitch wont let us
[1:22:02] <%Bt_Robot> 12% to Kodama sensing?
[1:22:03] <knight_verse> Do the Dojo missions if you have any
[1:22:05] <+Shadic790> Just equip the biggest number for the weapon and armor you want
[1:22:06] <+dolvusman76> then you can start worrying about skills
[1:22:06] <slipdog> Its a bit guys
[1:22:07] <$realm_forge> You’re doing great pat
[1:22:10] <+monfo_the_great> Sell/trash everything. Including the possible good stuff. Especially the good stuff. You'll pick so much up you'll be back to full in no time
[1:22:13] <+JustToWatch> @PatStaresAt you might have a slightly easier time if you play this game with Doc and ask him to explain things to you rather than relying on the hundreds of hooting chuckle-fucks in the chat for advice
[1:22:14] <rios> Pat should play some Kenshi rn to destress
[1:22:17] <%transporterthesequel> Oh I felt that damage
[1:22:18] <shiny_prinny> there's 25 per region
[1:22:19] <%RayReborne> in the region pat, aka all levels c
[1:22:21] <pixelkenj> i always went with elixer drop+
[1:22:24] <Boya1995> it's generaly a good idea to only bother about changing out gear once every 1 or 2 levels
[1:22:25] <%SirGO0SE> psaGoblin
[1:22:25] <+twohitgood> it looks nothing like it in terms of the design of gameplay, though. and even less so with the level design.
[1:22:27] <%transporterthesequel> New Water and New Wind
[1:22:28] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> Isonade is pretty decent
[1:22:32] <+MrWrann> Not using paired raiken?
[1:22:32] <Boya1995> *stages
[1:22:38] <%SaiyanShoto> I always just kept a fire guardian cause fire does dot damage
[1:22:38] <T_Sasquatch> @rios that would be legit torture for everyone
[1:22:41] <fruit_pie_the_magician> minmaxing in this game is pointless until like super endgame, enemies will drop better shit than you have literally all the time
[1:22:43] <K1llingEdge> just swap gear out with better stats don't bother upgrading it in NG
[1:22:45] <%transporterthesequel> Lightning
[1:22:45] <EynoStiles> i really wish we could call some one to help him
[1:22:51] <slipdog> @twohitgood Cool. Thanks bro
[1:22:53] <%Nordguy> they're good dogs Pat
[1:22:54] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Pat, my honest to god advice, get a build and STICK TO IT. ignore other mechanics. if you don't want to do ninjutsu, don't. don't wanna do magic, don't. get big sword and do big damange.
[1:22:54] <pixelkenj> looks cool
[1:22:56] <+twohitgood> it looks more like nier than dark souls.
[1:22:59] <hassanico2> Isonade and DaibaWashi are the 2 starters you did't pick IIRC
[1:23:00] <%Speed1ines> One guy
[1:23:01] <oda_flobunaga> Fuck Kenshi
[1:23:04] <%Axellogic> Close combat damage is really good but you are prolly better off with KAto
[1:23:05] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @PatStaresAt So the Goblin is to not start over fresh, but it feels more like it's Not be Overwhelmed by Information, even though it's legitimately a lot to take in and relearn
[1:23:06] <%Monkeyweed21> Treasure Sense and Lightning
[1:23:08] <%Speed1ines> Kato is fine
[1:23:09] <Cosairen> treasure sense is pog
[1:23:10] <+dolvusman76> ONE GUY
[1:23:10] <%transporterthesequel> That's it, it does Lightning damage for your devil trigger
[1:23:15] <xeros720> the amrita gauge rate is high, so they charge quick too
[1:23:17] <%SWFanatic> psa1guy
[1:23:18] <+zanz_san> Fuck off one guy
[1:23:18] <TheMadBadger> You don't need to. Kato is fine for the entire game :)
[1:23:26] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> just take the guardian spirit with the stats you want
[1:23:28] <EynoStiles> they give close combat damage
[1:23:28] <rios> @T_Sasquatch
[1:23:28] <+DatAsuna> there's multiple goblins here
[1:23:37] <amiavamp> Isonade has Enemy Sense which is real nifty
[1:23:38] <xeros720> yeah, i used paired raiken for a lot, but Kato is fine for the whole game
[1:23:40] <+DatAsuna> The kodama are the strawberry goblin all over again
[1:23:41] <%JoshManVGH> This game is also just godawful with tutorials
[1:23:42] <%SWFanatic> It's a goblin gangbang!
[1:23:47] <+Exicuren> Paired Raiken has Treasure Sense, you can see treasure chests n the radar
[1:23:49] <RyuuAoi> psaBig psaGoblin
[1:23:51] <+darethsbane> one guy kato is fine for the entire game.
[1:23:52] <%RayReborne> yeah its a whole lot man i dont blame you Pat
[1:23:52] <Medo3G> Just do combo
[1:23:52] <%Axellogic> Kato is one of the best spirits in the game
[1:23:55] <EynoStiles> read the skills
[1:23:56] <%doomunderthestairs> psaGoblin
[1:23:58] <+PMAvers> What's that Close Combat Life Recovery do?
[1:23:58] <SainEdge> @PatStaresAt you get trough your first playtrough without worrying to much about most details, just equip big numbers and take combos you like and stick with it
[1:24:00] <%transporterthesequel> Some enemies are weak to different elements.
[1:24:00] <shiny_prinny> if they don't stand out, then it's ok to stick with Kato
[1:24:01] <toulon_somberjade> Because each element has it's own Debuff
[1:24:01] <%afronooch> I think i used kato the entire time with no issues
[1:24:04] <%SWFanatic> psaBig psaGoblin psaRaffle
[1:24:04] <amiavamp> Every spirit has spirit protection
[1:24:04] <%BinaryFireball> I think it's important to remember you can beat the game without being perfect
[1:24:05] <+lucaslaw2001> The best part of guardian spirits is that they all have unique attacks lmao
[1:24:10] <+ReallyBigRocks> In Nioh 2 I just picked the one I thought was coolest and just never used it
[1:24:10] <+HuoShengdi> tbh ki recovery speed is super good
[1:24:11] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I can't even blame Pat... I LITERALLY re-started Nioh 1 thiss week JUST to re-learn how to play and go back to my original data
[1:24:12] <slipdog> The primary reasoning for everything you choose in your first playthrough should be how cool it is
[1:24:13] <+DatAsuna> The biggest thing you have to accept is that many of the stats are such small buffs that they should never be deciding factors
[1:24:14] <Zeif00> psa1guy
[1:24:16] <SirMcSlushy> You see the spirit ya currently got on on the right side of that screen\
[1:24:16] <+tempestzephyr> it seems like there's so many mechanics in the game that a lot of them don't end up mattering
[1:24:17] <%Monkeyweed21> Raiken has treasure radar which is nice
[1:24:17] <%Axellogic> Dont feel bad Spiris are badly balanced in 1
[1:24:23] <+monfo_the_great> Play with what you have exactly as is. When you hit a wall that's when you look at your loadout
[1:24:23] <%transporterthesequel> Dude literally the Living weapon element is the ONLY THING that matters right now.
[1:24:27] <amiavamp> Spirit protection means that if you die and don't have your spirit, you're taking more damage
[1:24:27] <%doomunderthestairs> just be huge Pat you can do it
[1:24:29] <toulon_somberjade> also each spirit provides different benefits that are not obvious
[1:24:30] <pixelkenj> I used Isonade for Enemy sense
[1:24:30] <+Jack8274> I mostly chose them based on what Spell you got when using Guardian Talismans. Those are OP af in Nioh 1
[1:24:30] <+dolvusman76> @PatStaresAt You can cheese your spirit gauge with amrita stones, minimum of 10 tiny stones gives you a full gauge for free, so make sure you donate your crap items for that free stones
[1:24:31] <Cosairen> paired raiken are also cute puppies
[1:24:40] <%SWFanatic> Become Huge
[1:24:41] <fruit_pie_the_magician> None of it matters, you use the dog because the dog is cool. Is snake cool? use snake. the actual damage is negligible
[1:24:43] <toulon_somberjade> like different types of attacks from Guardian Summon Talisments
[1:24:46] <%Axellogic> Its a normal katana
[1:24:47] <+ReallyBigRocks> big numbers
[1:24:51] <+Savarro> This was my experience hopping back in whenever dlc came out. Being overwhelmed as fuck. and that's after beating the game
[1:24:53] <EynoStiles> We really wanna help pat
[1:24:54] <%transporterthesequel> Number is smaller, so no.
[1:24:56] <Zaphire_Saucypants> seems like this game is just overbloated with mechanics and its muckin up the gears in Pat's head as a result.
[1:24:59] <%SWFanatic> Whats that smell? It's Goblin
[1:25:00] <%RayReborne> higher level plus familiarity equals more damage
[1:25:02] <+DatAsuna> You should decide solely by element and how cool their attack is
[1:25:02] <+Shadic790> Familiarity increases damage
[1:25:04] <+MosesUnspoken> use whatever has the biggest number
[1:25:06] <+ReallyBigRocks> also no familiarity
[1:25:07] <SirMcSlushy> Familiarity too, probably.
[1:25:07] <%RayReborne> but also that
[1:25:07] <tank7013> Also familiarity
[1:25:10] <+Jack8274> Because the familiarity
[1:25:14] <%transporterthesequel> Focus on the attack multiplier for each weapon group. Also Level.
[1:25:15] <%SaiyanShoto> if attack don't go up it's trash
[1:25:18] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt no strength scaling
[1:25:26] <+monfo_the_great> Hell yeah!
[1:25:28] <%transporterthesequel> Big level mean attack go up.
[1:25:28] <xeros720> this is honestly why you trash everything but the rare stuff
[1:25:31] <Jontman42> the starter spirits are good through the entire game, other spirits become relevant when you know how the game works and want to do something specific with your build
[1:25:37] <+DatAsuna> Just sort by level and lock the first one on the list and treat that as your best sword
[1:25:42] <K1llingEdge> everyone uses the dang Odachi in Nioh 1 i swear
[1:25:42] <didgereedoodah> yeah just get rid of it
[1:25:43] <+DatAsuna> That will simplify things
[1:25:46] <TheMadBadger> Your gear is perfectly fine atm :)
[1:25:48] <%FunkyStreams> glorious Japan
[1:25:53] <xeros720> getting those shakes
[1:25:54] <%SaiyanShoto> You hanging in there?
[1:25:54] <%cvp5127> why dont you use a build guide
[1:25:55] <%Broand> Oh man you think this is some shit wait until you get to the hidden teahouse
[1:25:58] <amiavamp> is this better or worse than Factorio goblins
[1:25:59] <%SirGO0SE> i believe in the pat
[1:26:00] <%Axellogic> DId you know that Nioh has alto of stats
[1:26:00] <PwnyB> I believe in you. :>
[1:26:05] <oda_flobunaga> Oh no, the next main mission has Woolie's least favorite boss
[1:26:08] <KeiPrime> just pick the big number nothing here really matters all that much
[1:26:08] <%MugenSandan> @k1llingedge not me, dual sword pleb for life
[1:26:10] <+polothegreatest> Glorious Nippon
[1:26:12] <%RayReborne> i only selected all weapons
[1:26:13] <%Axellogic> You only did weapons
[1:26:13] <SirMcSlushy> You did select all weapons, I assume
[1:26:14] <+dolvusman76> @PatStaresAt get a friend to tell you what things do, like plauge Kappa
[1:26:14] <Profmcstevie> Get to some main content and go kill some shit, stop menu diving
[1:26:14] <%Broand> All weapon
[1:26:18] <lucky_5s> is that a green monster drink?
[1:26:19] <Cosairen> you can offer weapons
[1:26:20] <KaironFortressKnight> You only selected all weapons
[1:26:23] <%afronooch> @MugenSandan same
[1:26:23] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> you were in the weapons category
[1:26:25] <toulon_somberjade> Okay so I can understand how this is hell for you and for me it's "Ah yes, I get it."
[1:26:25] <%octavian_wolf> gotta do it for each catagory
[1:26:27] <%tank7013> You were only looking at weapons
[1:26:28] <xeros720> ah, didn't confirm, i did that a lot too
[1:26:30] <+DatAsuna> weapons and armour are different tabs
[1:26:30] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt you were in the weapons tab, not the armor tab
[1:26:34] <K1llingEdge> @MugenSandan LMAO same
[1:26:34] <%Axellogic> At the end is all
[1:26:35] <+zanz_san> you were on the all weapons tab
[1:26:40] <%transporterthesequel> YES BURN IT
[1:26:44] <%transporterthesequel> BURN IT ALL
[1:26:57] <+dolvusman76> BURN FOR MATERIALS
[1:26:59] <Boya1995> rule #1 spread out your stats at least a little bit, rule #2 anything below purple is wothless, evything else wont matter until lategame
[1:27:00] <%MooseIsGoose> Burn baby burn
[1:27:02] <+dolvusman76> THIS IS THE WAY
[1:27:04] <%valriot> LUL
[1:27:05] <Medo3G> Can't have choice paralysis if you don't have choices
[1:27:08] <%transporterthesequel> Breathe Pat you're almost there.
[1:27:08] <+dolvusman76> GLORIOUS NIPPONS STEEL
[1:27:14] <+TaurusOxford> Why does Pat look like he's in pain?
[1:27:18] <%cvp5127> cheat
[1:27:20] <Treasure_Vault> Spending more time preparing to fight than actual fighting. What is this, Darkest Dungeon?
[1:27:20] <xeros720> got any samurai hairs?
[1:27:21] <toulon_somberjade> you got points
[1:27:22] <EynoStiles> i was really interested in this game, but now I really dont want to bother anymore
[1:27:23] <shiny_prinny> you could pick up a shitty one at the blacksmith
[1:27:23] <$Jaxnos> he is
[1:27:27] <+TheFlyingChurro> If you use Dual Swords you'll get a ton of points
[1:27:28] <%Axellogic> yeah Nioh 1 makes all weapons share skill points it sucks
[1:27:31] <topiodonk> he is
[1:27:32] <GoldySUP> You can reset points later
[1:27:32] <%valriot> Yo in Nioh 2, weapon, ninjutsu and magic point are based on use
[1:27:32] <T_Sasquatch> @taurusoxford because he is
[1:27:33] <didgereedoodah> you will get many more points
[1:27:33] <xeros720> oh, you also gain more points by using more weapons
[1:27:34] <amiavamp> If you use the other weapons you unlock more samurai points
[1:27:35] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> POINTS ARE GIVEN OUT PER EACH WEAPON, JUST USE EM AND YOU WILL GET POINTS
[1:27:35] <%MugenSandan> You'll get more points later
[1:27:36] <Cosairen> he is in pain
[1:27:36] <%RayReborne> Weapon skills get earned for using any weapon. using the dual swords will give you skill points
[1:27:38] <xeros720> or rather, new weapons
[1:27:39] <+Jakeofalco> @PatStaresAt you might have items that give you points to use dude
[1:27:40] <%MooseIsGoose> You get a lot of points for a wepon you do not normally use or is low level I think
[1:27:41] <Cosairen> his brain hurty
[1:27:42] <+HuoShengdi> you'll get more points
[1:27:43] <+Local16> So glad 2 fixed that
[1:27:43] <+zanz_san> there are Respec items
[1:27:43] <+theomnisoup> oh god weapon skills share points in 1 ?
[1:27:43] <+dolvusman76> You can cheese Points from other weapons and dump them into your preffered weapon @PatStaresAt
[1:27:45] <%transporterthesequel> You made no wrong decisions here. don't worry about it.
[1:27:49] <@GeneralSCPatton> @eynostiles Nioh 2 is infinitely better and smoothes over a lot of things
[1:27:50] <toulon_somberjade> then buy a book of reincarnation
[1:27:51] <TheMadBadger> @TaurusOxford Mind goblins are mean, especially in this game with a million small mechanics. He's being overwhelmed and chat isn't helping.
[1:27:52] <%transporterthesequel> PER WEAPON IS NIOH 2 DUDE
[1:27:53] <%Monkeyweed21> yea they fixed this in Nioh 2
[1:27:53] <+TaurusOxford> @T_Sasquatch Just wanted to be sure I wasn't seeing things. LUL
[1:27:54] <%valriot> No they're not, that's in Nioh 2
[1:27:56] <Medo3G> Maybe the challenge should be play the game while paying minimal attention to this shit
[1:27:56] <+McSoliace> can't you respec too?
[1:27:58] <pixelkenj> Use ninjutsu/spells for their respective points as well
[1:27:59] <+monfo_the_great> Samurai hair is like souls. Do you have any in inventory?
[1:27:59] <KaironFortressKnight> No that's in 2.
[1:27:59] <topiodonk> does this have respec? i dont remember
[1:28:01] <SainEdge> i believe in you Pat, let go at the goblins, embrace the big numbers and fun sounding combos and stick with it like a Chad LUL
[1:28:05] <%Axellogic> Do you want to see how you get skill points?
[1:28:08] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Is it only in 2 that you can just respec whenever ?
[1:28:10] <%MooseIsGoose> See if black smith has any
[1:28:21] <amiavamp> There's a respec book you buy
[1:28:21] <Cosairen> just do it pat :)
[1:28:22] <+dolvusman76> Item in shop
[1:28:22] <DXLelouch24> No thts nioh 2 one guy
[1:28:22] <KeiPrime> you can respec in this one too
[1:28:22] <+TaurusOxford> @TaurusOxford Thanks for elaborating.
[1:28:23] <sirrice77> @EynoStiles You can get by just fine with just going for bigger number and putting points to make health, stam, and damage bigger
[1:28:27] <toulon_somberjade> Book of Reincarnation
[1:28:27] <%Axellogic> Dual swords still scle off strength as well
[1:28:27] <%transporterthesequel> Axe and Odachi is FINE for now!
[1:28:28] <primaryfire> @fruit_pie_the_magician you can respec, just gotta buy the book from the blacksmith
[1:28:30] <+dolvusman76> Its a book and its expensivce
[1:28:30] <xeros720> yeah, 1 makes it expensive
[1:28:32] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt NO that is only in Nioh 2, in 1 all weapons share points
[1:28:32] <shiny_prinny> you Still get points per weapon in Nioh 1, but you can use them in other weapon trees
[1:28:33] <AEnemyStandUser> that selection sound sounds so familiar
[1:28:33] <+Local16> In 2 you can buy respec items pretty quick I don't rememeber in 1
[1:28:33] <+zanz_san> book of reincarnation
[1:28:34] <EynoStiles> @generalscpatton that may be, but this isnt sale it for me at all
[1:28:34] <SunsetJack> She sells a book in items.
[1:28:35] <T_Sasquatch> Ok what's the goblin you're trying to overcome because it sounds like you should stop caring about this menu shit
[1:28:35] <topiodonk> there it is
[1:28:35] <Jontman42> Nioh 1 limits your weapon choices without respeccing, Nioh 2 you can just use whatever and get points for that
[1:28:35] <+DatAsuna> There's an item called a-- yeah that
[1:28:37] <topiodonk> no lol
[1:28:38] <amiavamp> Money barely matters
[1:28:39] <SunsetJack> No.
[1:28:39] <%A_Mighty_Walrus> no it's not really
[1:28:40] <Westorz> Why is the audio so wavey
[1:28:40] <GoldySUP> that's nothing
[1:28:40] <+DatAsuna> not really
[1:28:41] <%RayReborne> no you have a shitton of money
[1:28:43] <%Speed1ines> Money is meaningless
[1:28:43] <xeros720> oh, that's cheaper than i remember
[1:28:43] <didgereedoodah> you need a book of ressurection
[1:28:44] <SunsetJack> Money is meh.
[1:28:44] <+DatAsuna> gold comes easy
[1:28:44] <KaironFortressKnight> Nah that's cheap lol
[1:28:44] <toulon_somberjade> and it goes up each time you buy it
[1:28:45] <%octavian_wolf> not a lot of money
[1:28:46] <shiny_prinny> not really
[1:28:47] <%rekinom> The goblins you have for this game are too close to the ones I have and I'm getting secondhand anxiety
[1:28:47] <+PMAvers> I mean, you seem to have 165k, so 10k seems like nothing.
[1:28:50] <xeros720> i wonder if they dropped it
[1:28:50] <KeiPrime> at this point maybe but not really
[1:28:50] <+Jakeofalco> @PatStaresAt for your own head get the fuck out of here
[1:28:51] <+theomnisoup> your build is fine pat
[1:28:51] <%afronooch> no
[1:28:51] <%MooseIsGoose> You have a crap ton of money
[1:28:52] <toulon_somberjade> but also IT ISN'T A LOT
[1:28:53] <primaryfire> the price does go up every time you buy one
[1:28:55] <%tank7013> It's less than a 15th of your money
[1:28:55] <+dolvusman76> no issue
[1:28:56] <TheMadBadger> Stream is fine :)
[1:28:56] <+HuoShengdi> look at how much money you have
[1:28:56] <%PatNTheHat> Audio is fine
[1:28:58] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Money is literally trash in this game
[1:28:58] <+ReallyBigRocks> you have enough money to respec 16 times Pat
[1:28:59] <%SaiyanShoto> no the audio is fine
[1:28:59] <+rafaelba93> fine here
[1:29:00] <%A_Mighty_Walrus> yeah audio sounds fine here
[1:29:00] <fimbulvetr27> That's cheap. Only 10k for the first purchase
[1:29:01] <%Maids4lyfe> no
[1:29:03] <+McSoliace> no it was the fire
[1:29:04] <%Maids4lyfe> audio is fine
[1:29:05] <lucky_5s> AYAYA souls
[1:29:05] <toulon_somberjade> like money you get like candy
[1:29:05] <%greasypete00> audio is fine
[1:29:06] <%Broand> Oh right money and souls are different
[1:29:07] <pixelkenj> vaporwavy
[1:29:08] <+dolvusman76> Not alot of money
[1:29:10] <Profmcstevie> Learn to refresh one guy
[1:29:15] <%Axellogic> I'm stressed by proxy:V
[1:29:17] <SirMcSlushy> Could also be mouth direction to mic shifting, but I haven't really noticed it.
[1:29:17] <EynoStiles> @sirrice77 I get that, but its how pat presents that making go no
[1:29:18] <+dolvusman76> MISSION LEVELS DONT MATTER, THEY LIE
[1:29:20] <%CatastropheCorvid> The audio for the fireplace there was pretty strong, but that's just the game
[1:29:21] <Zaphire_Saucypants> awww, elmo.
[1:29:22] <+McSoliace> fire has a sound
[1:29:25] <fruit_pie_the_magician> You can afford like 20 of them
[1:29:26] <pixelkenj> Mission overview will tell you if there are any kodama
[1:29:31] <%tank7013> Oh boy blighttown
[1:29:31] <%Djinnazz> That’s the fire burning dide
[1:29:32] <%Bt_Robot> But also the soundtrack is terrible for anyone with migraines
[1:29:34] <%Djinnazz> Dude
[1:29:37] <+dolvusman76> You will always be underleveled
[1:29:39] <%SirGO0SE> they pretty cute ngl
[1:29:42] <%CoffeeKaiju> psaMenace psaMenace psaMenace
[1:29:45] <didgereedoodah> can you level up
[1:29:45] <%A_Mighty_Walrus> yeah
[1:29:47] <Cosairen> mines FeelsAmazingMan
[1:29:47] <toulon_somberjade> 5
[1:29:49] <oda_flobunaga> 5
[1:29:49] <%Axellogic> @PatStaresAt  its ONLY drop chance
[1:29:50] <zettig> 5
[1:29:50] <%MugenSandan> 5
[1:29:51] <%SaiyanShoto> yeah
[1:29:55] <shiny_prinny> Yes UNLESS you have a bunch in your storehouse
[1:29:57] <%SirGO0SE> i like the on ein the red hat swinging away
[1:29:59] <didgereedoodah> 5
[1:30:00] <Boya1995> 3+2
[1:30:04] <theshillman> apparently so, yeah
[1:30:04] <@GeneralSCPatton> Kodama only determine the freebies from sitting. You still have a stockpile you refill from.
[1:30:04] <sirrice77> @EynoStiles I understand, but i recommend just getting it when it's on sale or something and just not diving too deep into mechanics until late game
[1:30:08] <Profmcstevie> what is 5 compared to 8
[1:30:11] <+zanz_san> the kodama affects drop chance
[1:30:11] <primaryfire> there's a skill in the ninjutsu tree that increases max elixirs
[1:30:14] <%MugenSandan> Base amount is 3
[1:30:15] <%tank7013> @PatStaresAt Those are all taken from your storage. The bottom threshold for free elixers is three
[1:30:16] <K1llingEdge> u store them up like blood vials
[1:30:18] <zettig> you only start with 3
[1:30:18] <toulon_somberjade> each shrine will get you a baseline, then you gain more from the elixirs stored in your warehouse
[1:30:20] <%octavian_wolf> that is for the base number if you have none in your storehouse
[1:30:21] <+Qexec> 3 base plus 2 plus any overflow up to 8
[1:30:22] <didgereedoodah> you start with 3
[1:30:23] <klx5> That's a minimum you start with not the maximum you can hold
[1:30:26] <+dolvusman76> You can increaase the ammount you can carry
[1:30:29] <SirMcSlushy> So you're getting 1 from somewhere else, been too long to remember. I didn't even know the Kodamas gave you more elixer uses.
[1:30:29] <%Monkeyweed21> thats the base amount of elixers @PatStaresAt
[1:30:29] <Cosairen> pat thats drop chance
[1:30:32] <+dolvusman76> In Ninjutus
[1:30:32] <EynoStiles> @sirrice77 thank you
[1:30:32] <SainEdge> 3 is the minimum you always get
[1:30:35] <SirMcSlushy> Prob a ninja talent
[1:30:37] <fruit_pie_the_magician> If you have tons of them in your storehouse they would just fill like blood vials
[1:30:38] <Jontman42> kodama is more equivalent to kindling than estus shards
[1:30:41] <%Monkeyweed21> YOU WILL NEVER RUN OUT OF ELIXERS
[1:30:43] <%Speed1ines> you probably have the ninja skill
[1:30:45] <klx5> if you run out of extras in your storehouse you will always have 3. With this buff from the kodamas you will always have at least 5.
[1:30:47] <fruit_pie_the_magician> but unlike blodd vials you will never have 0
[1:30:47] <Bonebagmel> +2 max carrying
[1:30:47] <%valriot> It literally says drop rate
[1:30:49] <%Axellogic> YOu have a minimum of 3 elixer at all times
[1:30:49] <%tank7013> 3 is the minimum free per life or shrine visit
[1:30:53] <%Broand> Base amount is 3, +2 from kodama +3 from storage, = 8
[1:30:53] <%MugenSandan> You can never go below 3 elixers when you respawn
[1:30:54] <+kewlmyc> You always get AT LEAST 3
[1:30:55] <marsnbars> o think there are skills that increase the amount you can hold too
[1:30:57] <@GeneralSCPatton> Kodama only determine the freebies from sitting. You still have a stockpile you refill from.
[1:30:58] <toulon_somberjade> Okay
[1:30:59] <%octavian_wolf> they always give you some
[1:31:00] <Bonebagmel> ELIXIRS ARE PLENTIFUL
[1:31:02] <pixelkenj> you can totally run out yes
[1:31:02] <$realm_forge> This whole game seems to be set up to be confusing
[1:31:05] <+rafaelba93> i played a lot of this and never knew any of this shit
[1:31:05] <+ReallyBigRocks> maybe but you had like 200
[1:31:06] <%tank7013> @PatStaresAt The game ALWAYS gives you at least 3
[1:31:07] <+DatAsuna> Basically you have 3+2 as the base amount per respawn
[1:31:07] <%Broand> Nope, your minimum is 5
[1:31:08] <%valriot> YOU ALWAYS HAVE 3 EVEN IF YOU RUN OUT
[1:31:09] <Boya1995> you always get a minnimum of 3 every time tou rest
[1:31:11] <amiavamp> Kodama give you free elixirs when you run out
[1:31:11] <toulon_somberjade> so elixirs are both Estus and lifegems in one
[1:31:12] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt No, you always have 3
[1:31:12] <+Local16> @PatStaresAt You get them from buring gear too
[1:31:12] <shiny_prinny> you start with 3, then +1 default elixir per 5 kodama
[1:31:13] <%MooseIsGoose> it is like they mixed blood vials and the elixar
[1:31:14] <didgereedoodah> you will always get at least 3
[1:31:15] <+dolvusman76> You start with 3 and then you get a bonus from the Kodama's and the rest is filled from your inventory
[1:31:16] <+DatAsuna> They are estus AND moon grass at the same time
[1:31:16] <Bonebagmel> TO HAVE MORE THAN 3
[1:31:16] <Cosairen> you just gained like 40 for those offerings
[1:31:17] <K1llingEdge> i think u should start with 5 rn if u dont have any in strehouse
[1:31:17] <+SilverDevilfish> to have more than 3
[1:31:17] <+MrWrann> Blood vials
[1:31:18] <topiodonk> for having more than 3
[1:31:18] <%tank7013> To have more than 3
[1:31:19] <Boya1995> surplus
[1:31:19] <+ReallyBigRocks> in case ur bad
[1:31:19] <SirMcSlushy> To have more then 3
[1:31:19] <%octavian_wolf> so you have more than 3
[1:31:19] <+kewlmyc> To have more?
[1:31:19] <%valriot> So you can carry 8
[1:31:20] <primaryfire> 3 is not enough lmao
[1:31:20] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> You'll run out of excess.
[1:31:20] <%captain_thickthighs> only if u suck though
[1:31:20] <@Ranryu692> so you can have more than 3?
[1:31:20] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> so you can carry more
[1:31:21] <%shadowace2400> wow, yeah, that person has no idea what he's talking about
[1:31:22] <%Broand> So you can have more than 3
[1:31:23] <%JoshManVGH> Extra
[1:31:23] <+JustToWatch> to have more than 3
[1:31:23] <+Savarro> To have more
[1:31:23] <klx5> to have more than 3
[1:31:23] <KaironFortressKnight> To have more than 3?
[1:31:24] <+DatAsuna> Because you can have more
[1:31:24] <%Monkeyweed21> REFILLS
[1:31:24] <+McSoliace> extra
[1:31:25] <%RayReborne> this game is the worst for goblins AND backseating chat. this is miserable
[1:31:26] <%Agami23> to have more than 3
[1:31:26] <%SaiyanShoto> To have more than 3
[1:31:26] <+dolvusman76> YOUR STOREHOUSE
[1:31:27] <%MugenSandan> makes things easier
[1:31:27] <oda_flobunaga> To have more than 3
[1:31:28] <%cvp5127> pat inside voice
[1:31:28] <EynoStiles> u can hold more pat
[1:31:29] <+theomnisoup> BLOOD VIALS
[1:31:29] <%shadowace2400> you literally have a limited inventory
[1:31:29] <SwindlerOfProgress> Because you can carry 8 at a time
[1:31:29] <%MooseIsGoose> Surplus its dumb
[1:31:30] <PwnyB> NotLikeThis
[1:31:30] <vVAstrAVv> you always get a minimum if youre OUT out
[1:31:31] <@GeneralSCPatton> ELIXIRS ARE ESTUS AND BLOOD VIALS
[1:31:31] <theshillman> do you only want 3?
[1:31:31] <%zeroarturia> for boss battles.
[1:31:33] <SainEdge> to get more
[1:31:37] <%shadowace2400> you can RUN OUT
[1:31:38] <%RealThiele> slightly kinder than bloodborne
[1:31:38] <%RayReborne> Drop rate
[1:31:39] <vVAstrAVv> FOR MORE THAN 3
[1:31:39] <%MooseIsGoose> Increasing base
[1:31:39] <%CappuccinoGuil> Increasing cap?
[1:31:39] <%Axellogic> Helping you get more
[1:31:40] <%valriot> IT SAYS DROP RATE
[1:31:40] <+ReallyBigRocks> more
[1:31:40] <topiodonk> helping you have more than 3
[1:31:40] <%SirGO0SE> makes more drop?
[1:31:41] <+dolvusman76> FREE ELIXRS
[1:31:41] <solfuture> +2 is added to the floor of three
[1:31:41] <%octavian_wolf> you would have 5, not 3
[1:31:41] <sennoh> to carry more than 3
[1:31:41] <+DatAsuna> Getting even more
[1:31:42] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> kodamas make enemies drop more
[1:31:43] <Bonebagmel> So you have more
[1:31:43] <EynoStiles> it give you 2 extra
[1:31:44] <%PatNTheHat> Kodamas increase drop chance
[1:31:44] <klx5> you will always have at least 5
[1:31:44] <Jontman42> KODAMA INCREASE HOW MANY YOU CAN CARRY
[1:31:45] <@GeneralSCPatton> KODAMAS = KINDLING
[1:31:45] <SirMcSlushy> You can only have so many equipt at once, so I assume more per rest.
[1:31:45] <+MosesUnspoken> To have more than 5 :D
[1:31:45] <+theomnisoup> INCREASING MINIMUM
[1:31:45] <%Broand> making your minimum higher
[1:31:46] <%blastyoboots> more blood vials
[1:31:46] <$Jaxnos> making it easier to get more than 3
[1:31:46] <KaironFortressKnight> Raises the minimum incase you run out
[1:31:46] <klx5> with that buff
[1:31:48] <Boya1995> it gives you more free ones
[1:31:48] <primaryfire> it's very hard to beat the game with only 3 elixirs for bosses
[1:31:49] <%MooseIsGoose> Its dumb
[1:31:49] <ElSuperNova> just chug my guy
[1:31:49] <%RayReborne> ALSO DROP RATE
[1:31:50] <+Local16> 3 increased your max that you can carry
[1:31:51] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt you start with 5 minimum now instead of 3
[1:31:51] <T_Sasquatch> This is hilarious
[1:31:52] <oda_flobunaga> To start with more than 3
[1:31:52] <Profmcstevie> Starting you off with more
[1:31:52] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Giving you more
[1:31:53] <%Broand> @RayReborne quiet you
[1:31:53] <%Birdigalore> GOBLINS WIN
[1:31:53] <toulon_somberjade> FREE ELIXIRS THAT DON'T take from your storage
[1:31:53] <Zaphire_Saucypants> God, this is awful
[1:31:54] <smokios> to have bigger base
[1:31:54] <+McSoliace> at the start
[1:31:54] <JetpackMcQuack> monkaS
[1:31:55] <%octavian_wolf> you would have 5
[1:31:55] <%tank7013> Chat why the fuck would you word it like that
[1:31:56] <+DatAsuna> It is now 3+2
[1:31:56] <theshillman> increase droprate so you can pick up more?
[1:31:57] <%shadowace2400> I have no idea what these people are talking about
[1:31:57] <%MugenSandan> now instead of only 3 you now get 5
[1:31:57] <+ultimafullmetal> Gives you more than 3 on respawn
[1:31:57] <%SirGO0SE> pat its not too complicated i think LUL
[1:31:58] <smokios> so no 3 but 5
[1:31:59] <fruit_pie_the_magician> FILL THE STOREHOUSE
[1:31:59] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt The kodama's increase ur maximum
[1:31:59] <%reaver93> It's a consumable, like a health potion. It's NOT an estus
[1:32:00] <pixelkenj> Kodama blessing will let you build up a stockpile easier
[1:32:00] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> FUCKIN CHAT KODAMAS MAKE ENEMIES DROP MORE
[1:32:00] <vVAstrAVv> giving even more
[1:32:01] <Thepothero> this is great
[1:32:01] <%justcallmebobplease> KODAMA = BONFIRE KINDLING
[1:32:03] <$realm_forge> JUST PLAY HALO
[1:32:03] <Medo3G> ! PAT AT RISK !
[1:32:03] <SainEdge> LUL
[1:32:03] <%zeroarturia> it increases the rate that enemies drop elixirs
[1:32:05] <%CappuccinoGuil> It's raising minimum starting elixir
[1:32:05] <mr_saturday93> INCREASE THR MOST YOU. AN CARRY PAT
[1:32:06] <+monfo_the_great> You spawn with 3 + extra from storehouse
[1:32:08] <%Monkeyweed21> 3+2
[1:32:09] <%Maids4lyfe> kodama raises the base
[1:32:10] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt Raises the minimun
[1:32:12] <SirMcSlushy> And the 'more then 3' is even if you do run out, it gives you 3 for free MINIMUM. 5 if the kodama thing is true.
[1:32:13] <EynoStiles> 3 to start, kodama give 2 more, and you can pick up more.
[1:32:13] <%valriot> Pat, read it, it says drop rate. it increases how FREQUENT they drop
[1:32:13] <+dolvusman76> NO
[1:32:14] <%hairtoday> sounds like restarting to a minumum number of blood vials
[1:32:15] <K1llingEdge> They are like bloodvials. The + allows u to respawn with more when u are empty
[1:32:15] <TheMadBadger> Elixirs also come from your stock of them and you can find them throughout the level. The kodama ones give you free extra ones to begin with. So you start with a base of 3, you're getting an extra 2 free ones from your kodama and the rest are the ones from your supply.
[1:32:15] <vVAstrAVv> the extra elixers are stored
[1:32:16] <%Bt_Robot> Kodama raises maximum AND minimum
[1:32:18] <%PatNTheHat> @PatStaresAt  Kodamas also increase the drop chance for elixers
[1:32:18] <+ReallyBigRocks> they increase the maximum minimum
[1:32:18] <amiavamp> From the wiki: "Basic maximum capacity 8 elixirs. Ninjutsu skill Medicine Man can increase maximum capacity by up to 3 elixirs, to a total of 11. Resting at Shrine will restore 3 elixirs by default, and 1 for each 5 Kodama found in the region. Additional elixirs will be added from storage."
[1:32:19] <mr_saturday93> Angriest pat is returning
[1:32:20] <PwnyB> Kodama increases your base amount to start with. You can pick them up in the world, also.
[1:32:20] <+JustToWatch> @PatStaresAt if you use your last elixir and die, you will ressurect with 3 elixirs, but for you it's 5
[1:32:20] <JetpackMcQuack> goblin has entered the chat
[1:32:24] <+McSoliace> minimum is the word
[1:32:24] <xeros720> this is the worst way to do this
[1:32:26] <%tank7013> Kodamas raise the minimum. The unbuffed number is three, so 5 now
[1:32:27] <theshillman> chat is lying hard tonight
[1:32:27] <didgereedoodah> NO THEY INCREASE THE MINIMUM
[1:32:28] <Jontman42> KODAMA INCREASE HOW MANY YOU CAN CARRY ON YOU
[1:32:29] <shiny_prinny> yes raises minimum
[1:32:33] <%toolofparanoia> Are those goblins?!
[1:32:34] <+Local16> @PatStaresAt You get 5 because of the kodama. The surplus then gets added ontop of that so you get 8.
[1:32:34] <%zarkazeon> it's like Estus. kodamas give you extra starting e ilers
[1:32:35] <FlashFrame> The answer is no one knows how the fuck Nioh 1 works.
[1:32:35] <%Axellogic> YEs
[1:32:37] <%tank7013> Always
[1:32:37] <K1llingEdge> YES
[1:32:37] <%reaver93> You have a shit load in your storehouse, when you run out in there you will only get your minimum
[1:32:38] <Profmcstevie> Can the Nioh experts with crayon degrees stop talking holy fuck
[1:32:38] <oda_flobunaga> 'SHUT UP CHAT
[1:32:42] <+Exicuren> Healer Blessing ups the elixir drop rate, Collecting Kodamas increase your MINIMUM starting elixir
[1:32:42] <@GeneralSCPatton> IMAGINE BLOODBORNE GAVE A FEW FREE VIALS WHEN SITTING. KODAMAS = KINDLING
[1:32:42] <%zeroarturia> yes
[1:32:45] <TheMadBadger> Yes.
[1:32:47] <%tank7013> Yes
[1:32:47] <rReizs> does he see the +2 on the right side of the screen
[1:32:48] <Cosairen> FeelsGoodMan
[1:32:49] <SirMcSlushy> Seems like it
[1:32:49] <shiny_prinny> YES
[1:32:50] <%Broand> yes
[1:32:50] <+dolvusman76> THEYRE BLOOD VIALS BUT YOU GET FREE VIALS FROM THE SHRINE
[1:32:50] <+ReallyBigRocks> yeah
[1:32:51] <+Savarro> Yes
[1:32:52] <topiodonk> "lol" says koei tecmo "lmao"
[1:32:53] <+kewlmyc> YES
[1:32:53] <%MooseIsGoose> yes
[1:32:54] <%octavian_wolf> yes
[1:32:54] <pixelkenj> Correct
[1:32:55] <klx5> yes
[1:32:55] <K1llingEdge> yes yes
[1:32:56] <+McSoliace> yes
[1:32:56] <oda_flobunaga> YES
[1:32:56] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> YES
[1:32:56] <+MosesUnspoken> YES
[1:32:56] <%MooseIsGoose> its dumb
[1:32:57] <+Savarro> yes
[1:32:57] <%zeroarturia> Yes sir
[1:32:57] <%justcallmebobplease> CORRECT
[1:32:57] <%zarkazeon> yes
[1:32:58] <%Axellogic> yes
[1:32:58] <+dolvusman76> YES
[1:32:58] <%PatNTheHat> Yes
[1:32:58] <%SaiyanShoto> yeah
[1:32:59] <SainEdge> yes!
[1:32:59] <+RahkshiLord> yes
[1:33:01] <SomeAsianDood> Like blood vials YEP
[1:33:01] <%Monkeyweed21> If you find all the Kodamas you start with maxed elixers
[1:33:02] <%RayReborne> @patstaresat if we had ONE GUY to talk in a discord call to you about all this, it would be genuinely less stressful and more helpful than a screaming chat
[1:33:03] <%Maids4lyfe> yes
[1:33:04] <oda_flobunaga> YES YES
[1:33:04] <%reaver93> IT BIG DUMB BUT YES
[1:33:05] <Treasure_Vault> this game is so dumb
[1:33:05] <%tank7013> @PatStaresAt Think of it as a combination of estus and blood viles
[1:33:05] <+MosesUnspoken> LUL
[1:33:06] <+Local16> Yup
[1:33:07] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> yeah
[1:33:07] <+Exicuren> Yes
[1:33:07] <amiavamp> It's 1 free per every 5 kodama
[1:33:07] <+McSoliace> it is
[1:33:08] <%Broand> That is a lie
[1:33:08] <K1llingEdge> it is kinda dumb
[1:33:09] <Zaphire_Saucypants> yeah...fuck that noise.
[1:33:10] <%Maids4lyfe> HE GETS IT NOW
[1:33:10] <%SWFanatic> Many scrimblo
[1:33:11] <+Local16> Absolutely
[1:33:12] <%tank7013> It is not
[1:33:13] <+DatAsuna> It's just estus if enemies dropped more
[1:33:13] <%valriot> Its designed to not think about it
[1:33:14] <%justcallmebobplease> IT'S FUCKING STUPID
[1:33:15] <%MooseIsGoose> I only saw it in a guide
[1:33:15] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> it sucks
[1:33:16] <+dolvusman76> IT JUST WORKS
[1:33:16] <+McSoliace> its stupid
[1:33:16] <@QueequegTheater> Someone help I'm trapped in Soul of the Creator with 3 braindead DPS
[1:33:17] <toulon_somberjade> it wasn't
[1:33:17] <%octavian_wolf> yeah, it DOES NOT tell you
[1:33:17] <pixelkenj> you learn it when you run out of heals :)
[1:33:18] <%darklordfodder> is the pc port of both of these good?
[1:33:19] <%Axellogic> we did it
[1:33:20] <oda_flobunaga> yep
[1:33:20] <+ReallyBigRocks> it almost certainly was
[1:33:20] <Jontman42> is that even correct
[1:33:23] <Boya1995> blood vials but with 3 garantueed
[1:33:23] <topiodonk> everything that isnt hitting enemies in this game is dumb
[1:33:25] <Cosairen> :)
[1:33:25] <@GeneralSCPatton> It's the child of Estus and Blood Vials
[1:33:26] <%Agami23> i dont think its told, you just gotta learn it
[1:33:30] <$Jaxnos> is this estus shard but too many step?
[1:33:30] <%MooseIsGoose> At risk
[1:33:30] <PwnyB> @dolvusman76 Kappa
[1:33:31] <%RealThiele> insight gained
[1:33:31] <SwindlerOfProgress> I played through all of Nioh 1 and 2 and didn't know that was a thing LUL
[1:33:32] <+theomnisoup> Another goblin slain
[1:33:33] <KaironFortressKnight> Pat go grab a drink man
[1:33:35] <+DatAsuna> @darklordfodder pc port is good yes
[1:33:36] <%reaver93> Think of the life gems from DS2, they are them
[1:33:36] <Zebroneath> Game is great, but also full of BULLSHIT
[1:33:36] <%Djinnazz> Not really
[1:33:36] <fruit_pie_the_magician> So many of them dropped for me it never even mattered.
[1:33:37] <%afronooch> @QueequegTheater oof
[1:33:37] <KaironFortressKnight> You need to unwind
[1:33:40] <+PMAvers> I think that the important part of enemies dropping elixirs is that you get them immediately in the field, so you can  keep exploring.
[1:33:41] <cartakus> don't be mad with green babys
[1:33:41] <+MosesUnspoken> You really don't have to think about it because elixirs drop like crazy anyway.
[1:33:41] <didgereedoodah> it is unclear but that is how it works
[1:33:44] <primaryfire> I have beaten nioh 1 and 2 and didn't know about the minimum elixir bonus from every 5 kodamas LUL
[1:33:46] <%zarkazeon> it's straight up m3h. tbh nioh never felt fun to me man. too many menus.
[1:33:46] <%octavian_wolf> you can level, I think
[1:33:47] <fruit_pie_the_magician> like every third enemy drops one
[1:33:47] <K1llingEdge> honestly i like it more than estus but it is more confusing at first
[1:33:48] <Treasure_Vault> @topiodonk 100% why is there so much of the game that isn't swing sword
[1:33:50] <toulon_somberjade> also you can only carry a max of 8 unless you take a ninja skill to raise the max
[1:33:50] <Cosairen> THE FRENZY BAR IS GOING UP
[1:33:52] <amiavamp> It wasn't enough that the combat had to be hard, they had to make it a text adventure game level of confusing too
[1:33:53] <+Local16> Pats getting the nioh eyes on the inside and those are the really bad ones
[1:33:55] <+HuoShengdi> PC port of nioh 2 is pretty solid, has some occasional bugs that get fixed with a restart
[1:33:55] <%transporterthesequel> YO is this who I think it is?
[1:33:56] <%MooseIsGoose> Take a break and rest after this mission
[1:33:57] <+ReallyBigRocks> the fart mines
[1:33:57] <%A_Mighty_Walrus> oh hey you can level up
[1:33:59] <%JoshManVGH> You know how in Dark Souls you get Estus at every Bonfire? Now you get that AND you can find more like in bloodborn. But pat do you want to know the worst part?
[1:34:00] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I suggest playing a more relaxing game after this, cuz jesus fucking christ.
[1:34:01] <BepBepAmShep> I like many things about this game, but it does a terrible job of explaining things to the player.
[1:34:05] <%MugenSandan> Only the creator can help you now Queequeg
[1:34:05] <toulon_somberjade> Time to bash some rocks
[1:34:06] <+Exicuren> Nioh 2 actually explains that shit, but people always skip the tutorial screens because there are TONS of them
[1:34:06] <KaironFortressKnight> Blighttown: Japan
[1:34:07] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> this area sucks, nioh 2 has better maps
[1:34:11] <JetpackMcQuack> now do it in blight town
[1:34:12] <%Monkeyweed21> welcome to the Brap mines
[1:34:12] <%valriot> LUL LUL LUL
[1:34:13] <TehMud> Oh god THIS level
[1:34:14] <oda_flobunaga> I don't understand Drunk souls, I do understand drunk Nioh though
[1:34:15] <%darklordfodder> I hope FromSoft tries harder than usual on their PC version of Elden Ring
[1:34:16] <+Savarro> Nioh 1 has a LOT of "Want it explain? That sucks go learn it yourself"
[1:34:16] <%Axellogic> YEs Nioh sucks at explaining shit
[1:34:18] <+ReallyBigRocks> it's important work, diggin up all these farts
[1:34:21] <@GeneralSCPatton> Chat is a poor substitute for an in-person coach
[1:34:22] <Boya1995> don't fight the numbers they are here to help
[1:34:23] <theshillman> yeah i dont know why you'd go back here
[1:34:34] <Treasure_Vault> kodamas sound like they're laughing at us
[1:34:35] <%valriot> Oh no LUL
[1:34:36] <$realm_forge> Blightown
[1:34:37] <%RayReborne> thats how it is
[1:34:39] <Treasure_Vault> i hate it
[1:34:39] <%Axellogic> Cause stats dont do much
[1:34:43] <SirMcSlushy> Cuz its low
[1:34:44] <%transporterthesequel> DON'T SKILL
[1:34:45] <%Speed1ines> because everything is low and incremental
[1:34:50] <%MooseIsGoose> This game is more gear dependent
[1:34:52] <+DatAsuna> because stat bonuses aren't big in general in this game
[1:34:52] <%Monkeyweed21> because gear is really important
[1:34:53] <%Maids4lyfe> because game hard git gud
[1:34:53] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I don't understand what's confusing. You start with a Mininum you get for free, you pay resources to INCREASE the Free Mininum and you always get extras about the free mininum.  It's like Yellow Hearts in Zelda vs Heart Pieces
[1:34:55] <%SaiyanShoto> Just how it is
[1:34:55] <didgereedoodah> they want you to spread out stats more
[1:34:57] <toulon_somberjade> Pat......
[1:34:58] <%transporterthesequel> Jesus christ ignore chat if they say level fuckin skill.
[1:35:01] <SirMcSlushy> Cuz many numbers, small increments, math boner.
[1:35:03] <%valriot> Pat, I'll be honest. Either just play 2, or I think you're just not compatible with this game
[1:35:04] <%Bt_Robot> Stats mean almost nothing in this game
[1:35:04] <+Jack8274> You mainly get big boosts from Armor set Bonus' in end game
[1:35:05] <$realm_forge> This game doesn’t look….fun
[1:35:05] <%RayReborne> Weve been saying the stats arent the end of the world like it is in dark souls
[1:35:06] <+Local16> @PatStaresAt Because Nioh is the game of getting a ton of levels so you end up pumping them to hell
[1:35:08] <JetpackMcQuack> chatlighting is a hip new term
[1:35:10] <SwindlerOfProgress> Different stats increase different things, but it's always very incremental
[1:35:10] <+ReallyBigRocks> also you don't have any weapons that scale with it right?
[1:35:11] <%GiantRatThatMakesTheRulz> GiantRatThatMakesTheRulz subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 13 months! Got to puppy sit for my cousin today. Those adorable little potatoes haven't even opened their eyes yet. Make sure to pet your babies after the stream.
[1:35:18] <+Qexec> wut
[1:35:20] <SirMcSlushy> Skill is fine if ya using a skill weapon.
[1:35:22] <%Axellogic> SKill is a stat on the most weapons in the game
[1:35:22] <Boya1995> Pat is in dire need of a Nioh coach, we are terrible at this
[1:35:23] <%Agami23> skill is darksouls dex
[1:35:23] <amiavamp> He can't even equip some of his items because skill is too low
[1:35:24] <+DatAsuna> It's not minmaxed, but it also doesn't matter
[1:35:27] <artoflec> @realm_forge well it super is LUL
[1:35:27] <+monfo_the_great> For your build it's not helpful
[1:35:28] <%MugenSandan> Skill isn't bad it just doesn't help YOU
[1:35:29] <SirMcSlushy> Its like dex in dark souls.
[1:35:30] <%transporterthesequel> For you, YES, it is a single minded DPS stat with a weapon you are not using.
[1:35:30] <xeros720> skill seems good for ninjutsu
[1:35:31] <+M0untain_wolf> everything bad
[1:35:34] <Treasure_Vault> @realm_forge There seem to be small, incidental parts that look fun. Like combat.
[1:35:37] <+kewlmyc> No, just one dude being an elitist.
[1:35:38] <Cosairen> :)
[1:35:39] <%Agami23> skill is dex, dex is faith
[1:35:39] <+theomnisoup> for your current build it doesn't do much
[1:35:43] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I get that.
[1:35:43] <+pieking83> the most confusing part is the first level in the game is the only level that allows you to carry 20 elixirs
[1:35:44] <+Jack8274> Depends on what weapon you use, every weapon has a main scaling stat
[1:35:44] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> ahaahahah
[1:35:45] <%cvp5127> LUL
[1:35:45] <%valriot> You did ask me once LUL
[1:35:46] <%Speed1ines> skill is fine if you want to use dual swords
[1:35:47] <%MooseIsGoose> lol
[1:35:49] <KaironFortressKnight> Then ignore chat
[1:35:50] <SirMcSlushy> Dexterity in THIS game, is ninja shit.
[1:35:52] <%afronooch> Skill good if your weapon need skill.
[1:35:52] <@GeneralSCPatton> The damage benefit from scaling oscillates with every 3 points in the stat. The returns are big, medium, small, and then big again.
[1:35:54] <topiodonk> did you bruteforce warframe?
[1:35:54] <toulon_somberjade> Like under level 100 you need to actually get a balance stat distrubution
[1:35:55] <%RayReborne> a screaming chat is worse imo
[1:35:55] <%SaiyanShoto> You're doing good
[1:35:55] <Samuy_JP> then don't ask us
[1:35:56] <KeiPrime> then just play the game dummy
[1:35:56] <xeros720> says dark souls coach
[1:35:56] <JetpackMcQuack> the dojo has a lot of info
[1:35:57] <$Jaxnos> should you just focus the stat for the weapon you gonna be usin?
[1:35:58] <+HuoShengdi> he's going for heavy build, he can just wear heavy armors
[1:35:58] <%ShinobiPhoenix> ACTUALLY, it's like Hollow Knight Hearts. you get Blue that goes over your maximum health, but you always get your true maximum back from benches
[1:36:01] <+ReallyBigRocks> lets do a wiki stream then LUL
[1:36:01] <zettig> That's respectable
[1:36:01] <%A_Mighty_Walrus> the game should be explaining it to you better so you wouldn't need one
[1:36:01] <EynoStiles> Just focus on damage, stop focus on the other numberye s
[1:36:02] <+JustToWatch> THE GOBLIN KING
[1:36:02] <%tank7013> I can respect that
[1:36:03] <%MugenSandan> MIND GOBLIN SEASON TWO PLOT LEAK
[1:36:05] <+Local16> @PatStaresAt And honestly you're doing a good job with it man
[1:36:05] <topiodonk> youre my hero
[1:36:05] <%Monkeyweed21> Baby needs to walk on his own 2 stubs
[1:36:05] <%SirGO0SE> Pat is Pat coach!
[1:36:06] <%captain_thickthighs> so goblins are proud creatures?
[1:36:08] <rReizs> IS THAT THE NEXT EPISODE
[1:36:08] <+TheFlyingChurro> Pat I am sorry we are making this harder on you
[1:36:09] <+Jack8274> Then you will be fine
[1:36:09] <dfs_k> but you are NOT doing it yourself at all
[1:36:09] <+McSoliace> at least there's determination
[1:36:10] <%Saadi90> Then ignore chat
[1:36:10] <Treasure_Vault> but you look like woolie playing Monster Hunter World with a thunder spear
[1:36:10] <pixelkenj> Ninja skills are amazing from my experience, just saying
[1:36:11] <T_Sasquatch> Honestly I hate dark souls leveling pages, people lie to themselves about build diversity
[1:36:12] <Jontman42> why are you listening to chat then LUL
[1:36:12] <%MooseIsGoose> Your winning its fine
[1:36:16] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> didn't you have plague for warframe tho
[1:36:19] <%tanarath> psaWink psaWink
[1:36:21] <topiodonk> YEAH, I WOULD THINK SO
[1:36:21] <%SirGO0SE> it really does
[1:36:22] <+eanscrale> It's like looking into a neurotic mirror
[1:36:23] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> You should probably look up soft caps for these skills, @patstaresat .
[1:36:24] <+polothegreatest> thats how a brake laundry machine LUL
[1:36:24] <TehMud> Look if the man can brute force Warframe he can brute force Nioh
[1:36:25] <%justcallmebobplease> I did that too, hard agree
[1:36:29] <+Exicuren> A Nioh coach LUL
[1:36:29] <+McSoliace> i bet
[1:36:30] <SirMcSlushy> Nothing wrong with doing it yaself, but yeah. If ya trying to ALSO be efficient, might take a bit.
[1:36:40] <%sleepystardewfarmer> remember the goal: to get through the game. Even if you have the worst stats, you know you can get through this game.
[1:36:40] <%captain_thickthighs> so even no youtube for warframe sounds like torture
[1:36:40] <%Monkeyweed21> remember when Pat used auto-mod on stream?
[1:36:41] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt You don't always get what you want, but if you try sometimes you get what you need
[1:36:43] <+DatAsuna> it is basically nothing
[1:36:44] <knight_verse> Just do the Dojo missions.
[1:36:44] <toulon_somberjade> Heart affects Swords
[1:36:46] <%SaiyanShoto> yup
[1:36:46] <%Speed1ines> all numbers go up really slowly
[1:36:46] <SirMcSlushy> I mean Dark Souls was KIND OF the same way with stamina increases.
[1:36:49] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Then the best advice is not to think about any of this and just get far
[1:36:50] <Thepothero> many scrimblo
[1:36:50] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> you can always craft weapons if it gets dire to just get going but you will get them sooner or later
[1:36:52] <%afronooch> yep
[1:36:53] <pixelkenj> Learn to fight with limitations
[1:36:55] <SirMcSlushy> But Nioh has armor that can increase your ki too I think
[1:36:55] <TehMud> I used the Wiki for learning Warframe because FUCK LEARNING THAT SHIT
[1:36:56] <EynoStiles> Pats goblins are starting get to me
[1:37:02] <%tanarath> Learning to mod weapons in warframe took a few hours, sure, but I was dumb.
[1:37:03] <amiavamp> Heart is very weak, but sword scales with it, and sword eats a lot of kit, so it's good for sword
[1:37:04] <RetributionP> don't worry the more pat fucks up now the better it will be when he wants to restart
[1:37:07] <TehMud> I LOVE Warframe but holy shit
[1:37:07] <%RayReborne> stats have levels that increase more or less every few points or so
[1:37:07] <%SaiyanShoto> that's why sometimes I would level up other skills that gave my stamina and health a bigger boost
[1:37:07] <%transporterthesequel> @PatStaresAt HEART, BODY, and STAM are all multi stats that effect things like KI, STAM, and KI recovery. DEX, SKILL, MAGIC, and SPIRIT are all DPS stats that focus on the weapon/skills/items you are using.
[1:37:08] <primaryfire> sometimes a larger increase will come every 2nd or 3rd level, it's really weird
[1:37:11] <%tanarath> This is M U C H worse.
[1:37:14] <+pieking83> none of the items from the first playthrough will carry over to ng+
[1:37:16] <+Savarro> I always focused my weapons main stat, then just body & heart. fuck the other skills
[1:37:17] <artoflec> ive never played this game using Katana, i might start up an odachi playthrough now
[1:37:20] <JetpackMcQuack> LUL
[1:37:22] <toulon_somberjade> Also unless you have 10 dex and magic you can't learn the next tier of ninja and magic
[1:37:22] <+Jack8274> What didn't you understand?
[1:37:24] <%chiazam> Hey Pat if these streams are about beating goblins then maybe you should get a COACH
[1:37:29] <+Exicuren> Heart increases the Ki Pulse recovery
[1:37:31] <%Axellogic> Builds are entirely dependent on our gear and that takes time to learn
[1:37:34] <primaryfire> there will be larger increases every 2-3 points for some reason
[1:37:36] <klx5> build guides assume ng+ and hardcore grinding
[1:37:36] <Jontman42> look at what your weapon scales with best and level that?
[1:37:37] <TehMud> On your first playthrough all that matter is BIGGER NUMBER
[1:37:40] <%Axellogic> Soft caps arent really thing
[1:37:40] <AzureFlame98> Only recommendation is get all stats to 15~20 first and go from there its generally how builds unfold for character stats.
[1:37:40] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt Don't worry, Nioh 2 is Sooooooooo much better LUL
[1:37:43] <cartakus> THERE ARE NO CAPS
[1:37:52] <%valriot> Yes
[1:38:00] <JetpackMcQuack> GOOD GUIDE THEN
[1:38:01] <%SaiyanShoto> Are there even caps in this game?
[1:38:03] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I just learned some really good skills with dual swords and that carried me through literally both games
[1:38:03] <oda_flobunaga> The only cap is 200
[1:38:03] <%SirGO0SE> uh oh stinky fart town
[1:38:04] <K1llingEdge> ^^
[1:38:06] <+DatAsuna> The biggest problem with nioh is that the wiki/fextralife are far less well maintained than the souls ones
[1:38:09] <EynoStiles> @oda_flobunaga he doesnt care, he wants to get through this first
[1:38:09] <GoldySUP> @PatStaresAt none of that build stuff is even relevant until ng+
[1:38:09] <TehMud> SPIRIT is probably the only one that needs to be leveled to a certain point for Guardian bonuses
[1:38:13] <@GeneralSCPatton> NO CAPS. DAMAGE SCALING IS SEMI-LINEAR
[1:38:13] <Bonebagmel> Is not a "as Im playing" build guide, those are end game builds. For when you are 40+ levels in
[1:38:14] <+dolvusman76> SMACK THE ROCKS
[1:38:15] <Jontman42> look at what your weapon scales with and level that, level hp and stamina if you feel like it
[1:38:15] <@Lion_kun> Pat, take an antidote.
[1:38:15] <toulon_somberjade> PAT Behind
[1:38:15] <sennoh> this ain't souls, we don't do order here
[1:38:17] <+dolvusman76> THE STINKY ROCKS
[1:38:19] <%RayReborne> destroy glowing rocks to get rid of poison
[1:38:20] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> kill that rock
[1:38:22] <toulon_somberjade> PAT the rock
[1:38:25] <%JoshManVGH> The WORST part of this fucking Elixir thing, is that you have to level up the bonfires PER REGION!
[1:38:25] <%Axellogic> Glowing rocks spew the poison
[1:38:27] <%octavian_wolf> break the glowy rocks to stop the poison
[1:38:27] <+DatAsuna> Basically there are no caps, because every 1 level is tiny
[1:38:29] <Boya1995> only numbers that matter is damage, BUT most damge isn't the same stat every level
[1:38:29] <oda_flobunaga> @EynoStiles I know
[1:38:33] <%MugenSandan> Ironically probably level the lowest numbers first and then the highest, because the highest was the damage stat
[1:38:36] <%greasypete00> I remember when I played through years ago I had no idea what the level scaling was like or what level I should've been at certain points in the game and when I looked up a guide it just made things worse
[1:38:37] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt Your weapons have a primary stat and a secondary stat, make those stats the stats you raise, health and stamina are always viable too. I'd ignore magic or ninjutsu since this is your first run and your weapons are not stated for magic or skill
[1:38:37] <SirMcSlushy> Oh man, he came outta nowhere.
[1:38:44] <%transporterthesequel> yeyeyeye
[1:38:44] <+ALazo> poisson
[1:38:44] <JetpackMcQuack> freed
[1:38:46] <+JustToWatch> lol
[1:38:46] <%Axellogic> You were still in the poison
[1:38:46] <theshillman> does smashing the glowing fart rocks make poison go away?
[1:38:47] <%baka_sugoi> DEAD
[1:38:47] <%tank7013> You were still standing in poison
[1:38:47] <+ReallyBigRocks> farts
[1:38:47] <%JoshManVGH> Coooool
[1:38:48] <%RayReborne> poison
[1:38:48] <solfuture> LUL
[1:38:48] <K1llingEdge> Uh oh Stinky
[1:38:48] <ToneBacas> poison
[1:38:49] <Treasure_Vault> During this stream I've gone from slightly interested in Nioh 2 to not at all interested, to REALLY interested. This game looks like a shitshow, but Nioh 2 is good? How?
[1:38:49] <pixelkenj> HUGH
[1:38:49] <oda_flobunaga> Poisson
[1:38:49] <%afronooch> poison
[1:38:50] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> poison
[1:38:50] <%octavian_wolf> poison status
[1:38:50] <SirMcSlushy> You got repoisoned somehow
[1:38:51] <$Jaxnos> poison swamp poison swamp poison swamp poison swamp
[1:38:51] <Zaphire_Saucypants> god, I can feel the frustration from here.
[1:38:51] <toulon_somberjade> POISON
[1:38:52] <EynoStiles> posion
[1:38:52] <+theomnisoup> POISON
[1:38:52] <Cosairen> poison :)
[1:38:53] <@Lion_kun> Pat, check your inventory, you should have an antidote.
[1:38:54] <amiavamp> You were debuffed
[1:38:54] <%SaiyanShoto> poison
[1:38:55] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> no you werent
[1:38:55] <berdins> it was stacking
[1:38:55] <%tank7013> Not enough apparently
[1:38:55] <%SWFanatic> Poisson FISH
[1:38:56] <%Axellogic> THe posion is still at that level
[1:38:57] <@Lion_kun> Poison lingers.
[1:38:58] <%afronooch> still had the poison effect tho
[1:38:58] <+dolvusman76> Not high enough
[1:39:00] <toulon_somberjade> You didn't take an antidote
[1:39:00] <+tempestzephyr> still infected
[1:39:01] <@Lion_kun> It's like Dark Souls.
[1:39:02] <%baka_sugoi> you where stinky
[1:39:02] <+McSoliace> there was more poison
[1:39:02] <EynoStiles> but you still had posion stat
[1:39:03] <%Taisuru> stinky
[1:39:07] <%chiazam> Whatever order Pat
[1:39:14] <%tank7013> You were still in the poison I guess
[1:39:14] <+theomnisoup> You didn't use them
[1:39:16] <Cosairen> you werent all the way above
[1:39:17] <%RayReborne> the Stat icon beneath the bars was still there
[1:39:18] <%PatNTheHat> It was convection poison
[1:39:19] <+JustToWatch> Darks Souls poison
[1:39:22] <toulon_somberjade> also you passed the poison genator several times
[1:39:22] <+dolvusman76> Smack the stinky rocks
[1:39:23] <%Bt_Robot> You were coated, like in DS2
[1:39:23] <rReizs> but what if he needs antidotes later
[1:39:25] <%transporterthesequel> Ground is poison gas, you passed the threshold to get poisoned
[1:39:29] <$realm_forge> This doesn’t seem fun at all
[1:39:32] <amiavamp> The poison inflicts a debuff, instead of being a damage area
[1:39:36] <$Jaxnos> gooey stinky
[1:39:36] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[1:39:37] <ToneBacas> feet are touching the poison
[1:39:37] <JetpackMcQuack> this game slaps
[1:39:45] <EynoStiles> Dark souls has nothing on this games bullshit. i swear
[1:39:51] <+ReallyBigRocks> the fart blower
[1:39:51] <%sleepystardewfarmer> this is the most annoying background music...
[1:39:51] <%Broand> There's rocks here which make the poison gas right?
[1:39:56] <EynoStiles> @realm_forge agreed
[1:39:56] <artoflec> this game is super fun, i know it was the same guy just saying that again but still
[1:40:03] <%SharkMissile> Man this game has some really terrible levels that should have been cut
[1:40:05] <pixelkenj> how many arrows you got
[1:40:05] <+Pharmakokinetic> Blightcon 2021
[1:40:11] <TehMud> @Bluwizard21 No no no. You want Ninjitsu and Omnyo as the buffs and such can make the game so much easier, especially on the first run.
[1:40:21] <%transporterthesequel> @PatStaresAt No matter what, we're here for you bro, we will defeat this midtrash TOGETHER.
[1:40:22] <%PatNTheHat> It's like they heard Dark Souls was obtuse and didn't hold the players hand and said "hold my beer"
[1:40:25] <%Axellogic> The yellow and green rocks
[1:40:26] <amiavamp> The glowing rocks are targetable
[1:40:26] <%valriot> Omg
[1:40:27] <%MugenSandan> Blightcon JAPAN
[1:40:29] <toulon_somberjade> Look below
[1:40:30] <%RayReborne> the rocks are obvios and on ground level
[1:40:31] <%tank7013> The big ones on the ground
[1:40:32] <ToneBacas> on the poison mist
[1:40:33] <%SirGO0SE> down there i think
[1:40:34] <%octavian_wolf> the ones on the ground
[1:40:35] <toulon_somberjade> to your right
[1:40:35] <+Jack8274> There are green glowing rocks that spawn the poison
[1:40:36] <%SirGO0SE> i saw what they mean
[1:40:37] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I've distilled these games into straight up 3 moves with the dual swords. It kills everything
[1:40:37] <klx5> on the floor
[1:40:37] <%RayReborne> and targetable
[1:40:38] <%octavian_wolf> they look funny
[1:40:38] <+theomnisoup> the stinky rocks on the floor
[1:40:41] <%SharkMissile> There are stinky fart gas rocks
[1:40:43] <%RayReborne> TARGETABLE TOO
[1:40:45] <didgereedoodah> no the gross ones below
[1:40:49] <JetpackMcQuack> Wait, WE'RE the hard game studio
[1:40:56] <%RayReborne> yeyeye
[1:41:00] <theshillman> there are rocks with Big Fart Clouds coming out of them
[1:41:05] <%valriot> Poison go down
[1:41:06] <toulon_somberjade> now no more poison
[1:41:11] <%SirGO0SE> fart rocks
[1:41:13] <artoflec> that hilt strike is so satisfying
[1:41:13] <%octavian_wolf> yeyeyeyeye
[1:41:14] <amiavamp> Stamina-depleting moves are good on skeletons in Nioh, unlike most games
[1:41:14] <dickbuttwoman> Does he know about ki restoration button yet?
[1:41:16] <%Axellogic> you did it
[1:41:17] <solfuture> Pog
[1:41:17] <+ReallyBigRocks> just another day in the fart mines
[1:41:18] <%RayReborne> that Hilt stab does amazing ki damage
[1:41:18] <theshillman> nice counter
[1:41:19] <Boya1995> Nioh 1 is like a early accses version of 2 with how many improvement the series had in this game alone somehow
[1:41:29] <toulon_somberjade> This is a sub mission
[1:41:32] <oda_flobunaga> No its not
[1:41:34] <theshillman> @dickbuttwoman yeah he know ki pulse
[1:41:36] <%valriot> The next main mission is the worst main mission LUL
[1:41:37] <pixelkenj> monkaS
[1:41:39] <+DatAsuna> The next level was a shrine over water
[1:41:40] <%SirGO0SE> "Honey did you fart?" "No, it was the rock"
[1:41:41] <toulon_somberjade> Oh right there are two poison rocks
[1:41:41] <shiny_prinny> another rock some where
[1:41:42] <%Axellogic> theres another rock
[1:41:42] <%afronooch> more rocks
[1:41:42] <T_Sasquatch> Kof xv beta is live now btw
[1:41:43] <%Broand> More rocks
[1:41:43] <vVAstrAVv> whyd pat pick 1 when 2s way more fun
[1:41:43] <%octavian_wolf> more rocks
[1:41:43] <SirMcSlushy> Dere's more stinky rocks
[1:41:44] <%RayReborne> different spot
[1:41:45] <Zebroneath> it's timed
[1:41:46] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> theres a second rock
[1:41:46] <topiodonk> its temporary?
[1:41:48] <+theomnisoup> more stinky rocks
[1:41:53] <klx5> you moved into a poisoned area
[1:41:55] <@Lion_kun> Man, Nioh 2's level design was so much better.
[1:41:55] <marsnbars> fhere's more than one usually
[1:41:56] <+DatAsuna> this was 100% optional
[1:42:00] <topiodonk> oh the rocks
[1:42:01] <toulon_somberjade> Now no more poison
[1:42:02] <pixelkenj> this is the mission gimmick
[1:42:04] <%valriot> Uh ohhh stinky LUL
[1:42:07] <theshillman> pat the red missions are the next mission, black side missions are optional
[1:42:07] <ToneBacas> poison clear
[1:42:07] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Yeah more good advice for this game is don't try to grind every sub mission
[1:42:08] <SirMcSlushy> Might be able to shoot dem?
[1:42:08] <mr_saturday93> Pat do you seriously not see the green smoke everywhere down there?
[1:42:09] <+Savarro> One thing I'll always give Team Ninja credit for is they supported the HELL out of this game with QOL improvements forever
[1:42:11] <%captain_thickthighs> so other than personal pride whats the worst if you just dump this for nioh 2 because this looks painful
[1:42:11] <JetpackMcQuack> 8/10*
[1:42:14] <SunsetJack> There are other rocks too.
[1:42:16] <SunsetJack> Like 3.
[1:42:31] <%cvp5127> wait till you get to the poop level
[1:42:32] <topiodonk> i wonder how this game was without all the qol
[1:42:35] <mr_saturday93> and enemies have poison there too iirc
[1:42:35] <%SirGO0SE> @Savarro yes this game is brimming with QOL Kappa
[1:42:43] <+DatAsuna> @captain_thickthighs Nioh 2 has most of the same problems with more stats for him to be confused about and an even worse story
[1:42:45] <+athuramn> @fruit_pie_the_magician strongly agree. the main missions are enough of an endurance
[1:42:47] <%valriot> Not really
[1:42:48] <@Lion_kun> Nah, it fixes a lot.
[1:42:50] <Bonebagmel> yes it does
[1:42:50] <TehMud> Nope
[1:42:53] <%afronooch> not really
[1:42:53] <%JoshManVGH> Iiiiot does
[1:42:54] <+Jack8274> It actually doesn't, so so much was changed
[1:42:55] <%Axellogic> For the most part it does but descriptions make mroe sense
[1:42:55] <cartakus> But it solves some of them
[1:42:55] <$realm_forge> Does this game suck? It might be me but I’ve seen zero redeeming things so far
[1:42:57] <shiny_prinny> it wouldn't matter, you still have to manage gear and shit
[1:42:59] <+dolvusman76> sorta
[1:42:59] <Boya1995> onboarding in 2 is also better
[1:43:00] <%tank7013> It does. But maybe a tiny fraction of a fraction less bad
[1:43:01] <amiavamp> People are exaggerating the difference between the 2 games, Nioh 2 is very similar
[1:43:01] <neekocheeko> same stress
[1:43:02] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt Devil triggers though
[1:43:02] <+dolvusman76> some issues
[1:43:02] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> it does, but you would start slowly, but yeah thats also fair
[1:43:02] <+theomnisoup> Pat would EXPLODE the moment he looks at the soul core screen
[1:43:03] <+TopTieramisu> but you can do it while playing as a pat avatar
[1:43:03] <+Exicuren> Nope, they fixed a lot of issues
[1:43:04] <SirMcSlushy> xD
[1:43:04] <didgereedoodah> the loot stuff is basically the same
[1:43:05] <%afronooch> LUL
[1:43:06] <%valriot> 2 is more clear with its information
[1:43:11] <marsnbars> it has some quality of life but also is still obscure
[1:43:11] <vVAstrAVv> nioh 2s more FUN
[1:43:12] <mr_saturday93> LUL LUL LUL
[1:43:13] <TehMud> Nioh 2 fixes alot and allows more options to get around said issues
[1:43:13] <T_Sasquatch> We are Legion
[1:43:14] <%Broand> It does doesn't not fix stuff
[1:43:14] <+JustToWatch> no prob
[1:43:15] <SirMcSlushy> Its pretty similar.
[1:43:15] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I don't even know what the QOL additions were, I played through it at launch
[1:43:15] <%RayReborne> guys the NUMBERS stuff is all still there holy fuck
[1:43:16] <+A0N33> LUL Chat strikes again
[1:43:20] <+DatAsuna> Pat would be stressing out staring at yokai cores if this was nioh 2
[1:43:21] <AzureFlame98> He'd still get super overwhelmed by the stat stuff which despite being toned back is still in Nioh 2
[1:43:22] <Treasure_Vault> Now we've gotta see him try it. Closure needed.
[1:43:23] <+Jack8274> It completely removes a ton of systems, changes the skill system to a sphere grid, and changes the HP so you start with max flasks
[1:43:24] <artoflec> people will never give these games credit its best to just play at this point
[1:43:25] <mr_saturday93> NIOH 2 is a video game
[1:43:27] <+Savarro> The burst counter mechanic they added is a major game changer
[1:43:29] <@Lion_kun> But the numbers stuff is much easier to understand.
[1:43:30] <+DatAsuna> He would still be confused about stats in nioh 2
[1:43:30] <vVAstrAVv> like 2s poison level is goo not fartgas lol
[1:43:32] <%cvp5127> pat just do whatever you can cheat later
[1:43:33] <K1llingEdge> i mean its the same goblins for him on both
[1:43:33] <@GeneralSCPatton> Honestly, this game is probably good to scrub away those goblins before enjoying the better game.
[1:43:34] <EynoStiles> it would be better to look at nioh 2 first, before you realize you waste all your time on nioh 1
[1:43:35] <%Logoth_> I like the cartoon mallet he has
[1:43:37] <+DatAsuna> Elixirs would be the same problem in nioh 2
[1:43:40] <T_Sasquatch> Maybe chat was the mind goblins we made along the way
[1:43:41] <%Bt_Robot> Fixes some issues, introduces much more, basically the Lost problem
[1:43:41] <%valriot> The loot is mostly the same, but everything else is explained better and written better and mechanics are just overall a huge improvement
[1:43:44] <PwnyB> Ooh, yeah, the stress over the Yokai Cores is real in Nioh 2 xD
[1:43:50] <SirMcSlushy> I'll admit, the Sphere Grid instead of the Skill Pages is a good change.
[1:43:52] <LunarRemix> You okay Pat?
[1:43:55] <%SirGO0SE> i dont think he even had other options
[1:43:59] <%cvp5127> its not a story mission
[1:43:59] <+DatAsuna> Gray missions are filler
[1:44:02] <%octavian_wolf> those are recommended levels, you are level 45
[1:44:03] <K1llingEdge> only swap living weapon with yokai abilities
[1:44:06] <+DatAsuna> Red missions are main
[1:44:12] <vVAstrAVv> chat i just got here what actually ARE the goblins
[1:44:12] <Zaphire_Saucypants> @LunarRemix No, I don't think he's okay.
[1:44:14] <%RayReborne> triangle and circle
[1:44:16] <%JoshManVGH> Oh man... the mission level flags

[1:44:21] <SunsetJack> Triangle + Circle
[1:44:21] <%Axellogic> stong attack and o
[1:44:22] <Reborn2killu> tirangle +O
[1:44:22] <%RayReborne> x and o is fucking wrong
[1:44:23] <%A_Mighty_Walrus> its circle and triangle
[1:44:25] <%JoshManVGH> Block and both attack buttons
[1:44:26] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> should be triangle + circle?

[1:44:57] <+lucaslaw2001> During living weapon pressing triangle and circle again does a unique attack based on spirit
[1:44:58] <SirMcSlushy> Ya still gotta avoid taking damage to a degree, cuz it treats the duration like a health bar.
[1:44:58] <+JustToWatch> lol

[1:45:00] <+Savarro> I've never understood how living weapon was supposed to help
[1:45:02] <%JoshManVGH> What.... the hell happened?
[1:45:02] <+Exicuren> You were the who facetanked the enemy
[1:45:03] <+HuoShengdi> you actually nearly killed it

[1:45:04] <%SirGO0SE> CLASSIC LUL
[1:45:05] <theshillman> oof
[1:45:06] <+theomnisoup> also its a fire element so it wouldn't have done much to that guy
[1:45:06] <@Ranryu692> are you sure this game isn't just bad?
[1:45:07] <pixelkenj> U____U
[1:45:08] <%transporterthesequel> Living weapons deplete when hit, yeah
[1:45:08] <sennoh> it's not a free win button LUL

[1:45:08] <Cosairen> annihilated
[1:45:09] <SirMcSlushy> But yeah, gravity true big boss.
[1:45:09] <@GeneralSCPatton> THE SUPER METER EATS ALL DAMAGE THO. BIG INVULN
[1:45:10] <didgereedoodah> that was unfortunate
[1:45:10] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> yeah, you still gotta avoid stuff so it lasts longer, but also LUL
[1:45:10] <shiny_prinny> oh no
[1:45:11] <ToneBacas> pee break with Gief?
[1:45:12] <+DatAsuna> Living weapon is good for one reason really -- no ki on basics. It's best to pop it when you're in a position to stunlock someone.
[1:45:14] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Jesus christ
[1:45:14] <%SirGO0SE> CMON LAUGH PAT
[1:45:15] <Reborn2killu> literally dont get hit
[1:45:15] <$realm_forge> This game kinda sucks
[1:45:17] <vVAstrAVv> @afronooch so it actually is the stuff 2 improved lol
[1:45:18] <%BinaryFireball> FREEEDOM
[1:45:18] <rReizs> back away, into unexplored territory
[1:45:19] <TenraiDaze> yeeted the fuck outta this mortal coil
[1:45:19] <toulon_somberjade> beingpatissuffer
[1:45:21] <%justcallmebobplease> YOU GOT THIS, YOU ARE MAKING PROGRESS
[1:45:21] <%ForlornCarton> LOL said the chat. LAMAO
[1:45:22] <%Cozy90> this game doesnt seem very fun
[1:45:22] <+Jack8274> You good man?
[1:45:22] <EynoStiles> @joshmanvgh he stepped back into a pit
[1:45:24] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> Living weapons are so much better in 2. Damn.
[1:45:24] <Boya1995> mind goblins are eating pat alive
[1:45:24] <%Axellogic> I like food
[1:45:24] <%RayReborne> Pat i can feel the misery and it sucks for me too man. i hate seeing this, i feel bad
[1:45:29] <primaryfire> this guy beat bloodborne
[1:45:31] <%afronooch> @Savarro do more damage and take no damage
[1:45:31] <%SirGO0SE> that shit was so funny
[1:45:33] <%transporterthesequel> Yeah, and also matching element so it didn't do the most damage to it.
[1:45:33] <+DatAsuna> Yokai have super armor, so it's best to stack the elemental debuff on them, that way living weapon will stunlock them
[1:45:33] <Johndagger17> how do I get a ps5 in Canada?
[1:45:34] <%JoshManVGH> This game is overdesigined by a country mile
[1:45:34] <%SaiyanShoto> But you didn't lose any health
[1:45:34] <+MosesUnspoken> You're doing well though
[1:45:37] <@QueequegTheater> Finally
[1:45:38] <%baka_sugoi> Pat I thought you played the SOULS GAMES LUL
[1:45:38] <+polothegreatest> What a nightmare game doodScrub
[1:45:40] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Just try to get to the next area, fuck this mission
[1:45:40] <$realm_forge> I don’t think this one is on you pat
[1:45:47] <solfuture> i believe in you, Orb
[1:45:48] <%tank7013> Hey but the poison is gone
[1:45:51] <%afronooch> @vVAstrAVv for the most part yeah, chat will still be a problem lol
[1:45:51] <shadoke> This game can really make a person need to emit a series of gutteral screams
[1:45:51] <SirMcSlushy> At least the rocks be brokededed still
[1:45:53] <Cosairen> now this is content
[1:45:56] <%Axellogic> I'm so glad I dont have the super goblins I never would have gotten to the point I liked Nioh
[1:45:57] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Man, at this point I just wanna see you do some yoga.
[1:45:58] <%SWFanatic> So its a draw?
[1:45:58] <+DatAsuna> In the alpha, living weapon duration regenned on hits, so you could touch of death bosses in a single combo
[1:45:58] <%SirGO0SE> at least we liked it :)
[1:45:58] <@QueequegTheater> Why is A12N such a breeding ground for bad DPS players
[1:46:01] <%sleepystardewfarmer> we're rooting for you!
[1:46:02] <%MooseIsGoose> We love and care for you
[1:46:12] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Really get your relaxation on.
[1:46:12] <+Savarro> @afronooch eh all they did was slightly stall a death for me, yokai form was way more useful
[1:46:13] <PwnyB> Orb will not be defeated though. I believe strongly.
[1:46:21] <+RahkshiLord> @primaryfire bloodborne is a baby game compared to some of the shit this game has
[1:46:21] <oda_flobunaga> the next story mission is the one Woolie brought up on the podcast as his least favorite in the game
[1:46:22] <%baka_sugoi> THE GOBLINS ARE WINNING psaGoblin
[1:46:28] <+WeLucklessJacks> At least the imposter isn't sus, huh?
[1:46:30] <%blastyoboots> Don't you just love how, if nothing else, Nioh has that annoying random kazoo as a background sound effect constantly for environmental effect
[1:46:30] <+athuramn> can someone in chat tell me specifically what the goblin is? I just got here
[1:46:31] <%valriot> Pat, this is basically how Woolie would've been in DS2 without your help
[1:46:34] <Cosairen> @QueequegTheater cause you can get carried super hard to it
[1:46:35] <K1llingEdge> thats how i felt fighting Manus after not playing DS1  forever today lolol. to me lie 10 tries
[1:46:39] <%MugenSandan> I mean you're still in the free trial Queequeg so tons of people will be in there in general
[1:46:40] <PwnyB> At least as much as I believe in the American Government.
[1:46:49] <+athuramn> he had an old character he's reusing?
[1:46:54] <theshillman> you cant block grab attacks
[1:46:57] <Reborn2killu> yes
[1:46:59] <%valriot> I do
[1:47:00] <SainEdge> yeah, this isnt a Pat game. But it didnt really work for me too, an now im playing and really enjoying nioh 2, even if i didnt expect it
[1:47:00] <EynoStiles> @athuramn What do these number mean goblin.

[1:47:32] <Boya1995> that boss is super blockable
[1:47:33] <+Axellogic> Yeah your gear sucks int he beginning and your block sucks
[1:47:33] <+dante_must_die_exe> don't ever block
[1:47:35] <artoflec> Blocking is the best way to deal with onryoki in my experience
[1:47:37] <oda_flobunaga> bad learn
[1:47:38] <cartakus> That us what I do now, only dodge
[1:47:40] <+Local16> @PatStaresAt You absolutely did
[1:47:40] <@Lion_kun> You can make tougness builds.
[1:47:41] <+Exicuren> Well, you learned bad
[1:47:42] <%JoshManVGH> Except no you should block because it's useful
[1:47:43] <sennoh> actually it's better to block and dodge at the same time
[1:47:44] <%valriot> Yes it is
[1:47:44] <EynoStiles> go to amor
[1:47:44] <shadoke> under defense
[1:47:45] <+TopTieramisu> it is tho
[1:47:45] <+SilverDevilfish> Below Defense
[1:47:45] <%Axellogic> under defense
[1:47:46] <%DEETRz> under defense
[1:47:46] <Reborn2killu> bottom right
[1:47:46] <Johndagger17> bottom right
[1:47:47] <+Jack8274> Toughness is poise
[1:47:47] <amiavamp> It's under Defense on the right
[1:47:47] <%RayReborne> Bosses and big assholes tear through your stamina
[1:47:48] <xiccy> it's in green

[1:47:50] <%Broand> yes it is, it's under defense
[1:47:50] <didgereedoodah> your armor
[1:47:51] <%Aleate> Isn't it under defense?
[1:47:52] <@Lion_kun> They are builds that decrease stamina guard decrease.
[1:47:52] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> yeah, bosses in nioh kinda want you to do things a specific way
[1:47:53] <@QueequegTheater> yes it is
[1:47:54] <FlashFrame> Right side of the screen, bottom block, under defense
[1:47:55] <klx5> it's under defense
[1:47:55] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt YES IT IS UNDER DEFENSE
[1:47:55] <%MugenSandan> Don't block people BIGGER THAN YOU is what the lesson is supposed to be but it is not taught very well
[1:47:56] <+HuoShengdi> blind
[1:47:57] <@QueequegTheater> Middle right
[1:48:02] <%valriot> Armour
[1:48:02] <%RealThiele> if your gonna be dumb, you gotta be tough
[1:48:03] <+SilverDevilfish> Heavier armor
[1:48:03] <@Lion_kun> Armor
[1:48:03] <+zanz_san> heavy armor has toughness
[1:48:04] <vVAstrAVv> blind
[1:48:05] <+MosesUnspoken> armor
[1:48:05] <rReizs> toughness is based on gear
[1:48:06] <EynoStiles> Armor gives toughness
[1:48:06] <klx5> armor
[1:48:07] <%JoshManVGH> Armor I think
[1:48:07] <%Axellogic> Heavier armor has higher toughness
[1:48:07] <+Exicuren> Toughness is Stability, is equipment stat
[1:48:08] <+theomnisoup> yes
[1:48:08] <+DatAsuna> blocking yokai is generally more dangerous than blocking humans
[1:48:08] <xiccy> Armor weight
[1:48:09] <Reborn2killu> get heavy armor
[1:48:09] <amiavamp> Heavier armor usually has more Toughness
[1:48:09] <theshillman> armor
[1:48:12] <$realm_forge> It seems kinda dumb
[1:48:13] <JetpackMcQuack> oh
[1:48:14] <+GynecoIogist> GynecoIogist subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months! yooooooo Pat "that's hot girl crying" Boivinny
[1:48:15] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt armor weight
[1:48:15] <%JoshManVGH> Heavy armor has more toughness
[1:48:17] <%Aleate> Armor makes toughness go up
[1:48:21] <amiavamp> Weight icon under the picture
[1:48:22] <Reborn2killu> on the icon
[1:48:22] <+Jack8274> @PatStaresAt You need to get Toughness to 200 to get the poise like Dark Souls 1
[1:48:22] <%valriot> The weight symbol
[1:48:23] <%RayReborne> weight
[1:48:24] <+DatAsuna> It says how much it weighs
[1:48:25] <pixelkenj> Bottom of the list
[1:48:26] <klx5> it weighs a lot
[1:48:27] <@Lion_kun> Weight
[1:48:29] <%SaiyanShoto> Weight
[1:48:29] <%tank7013> The pips next tot the armor symbol
[1:48:29] <+theomnisoup> it has the weight icons
[1:48:30] <%DEETRz> look at the 3 vertical weights
[1:48:30] <%MooseIsGoose> Look at stat requirements at the bottom
[1:48:30] <+DatAsuna> yeah you eyeball the weight
[1:48:30] <@GeneralSCPatton> The number of those weight icons on it
[1:48:31] <%Axellogic> So the icon of armor theres 3 weight symbols
[1:48:31] <theshillman> under the armor portrait
[1:48:31] <+dante_must_die_exe> anything belwo 3.0 Weight
[1:48:32] <Cosairen> loook at the little weights under the icon
[1:48:32] <+zanz_san> cloth or plate
[1:48:33] <%Speed1ines> the three pips under the item picture
[1:48:34] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> you can kinda tell by the look, it do look bulky, and weight
[1:48:35] <%Piemono> The weight icons under armor picture
[1:48:36] <Boya1995> symboll under the item  icon
[1:48:37] <amiavamp> There's an icon under the picture of the item
[1:48:37] <%RayReborne> and the icon underneath the picture
[1:48:37] <EynoStiles> your weight goes up
[1:48:38] <%octavian_wolf> the cups under the picture of the armor
[1:48:38] <JetpackMcQuack> sort and pray
[1:48:38] <+DatAsuna> yeah like dark souls
[1:48:38] <%A_Mighty_Walrus> there's an icon under the picture
[1:48:38] <xiccy> underneath the icon of the armor there are 3 weights
[1:48:38] <SirMcSlushy> Underneath the picture of the armor
[1:48:39] <%MugenSandan> Weight symbol is under the picture of the armor
[1:48:39] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt There is an icon under the armor's picture
[1:48:40] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> ok pat, under the picture, there is a small icon, with 3 pips
[1:48:40] <Johndagger17> Under the picture of the boot. Weight symbols
[1:48:41] <%Axellogic> 1 is light 2 is med 3 is heavy
[1:48:41] <%JoshManVGH> See the armor icon next to defense
[1:48:41] <shadoke> next to the armor symbol there is the 3 weight symbols
[1:48:42] <+zanz_san> cloth is light armor
[1:48:44] <+Savarro> The little icons under the picture
[1:48:44] <sirrice77> Right under the pic of the armor is a couple of pips on top of each other
[1:48:45] <vVAstrAVv> the bars next to the armor icon
[1:48:45] <cartakus> The persent of weight at the top
[1:48:48] <%JoshManVGH> Andnhow it has two pips
[1:48:48] <@QueequegTheater> yes
[1:48:49] <+Local16> @PatStaresAt Name has (M) or (H) on it
[1:48:50] <theshillman> SYMBOL UNDER THE ARMOR PORTRAIT
[1:48:51] <shiny_prinny> the percentage at the top: higher than 70% is really slow
[1:48:52] <%valriot> So this is Medium armour
[1:48:56] <+zanz_san> cloth is light plate is heavy
[1:48:57] <+Exicuren> There is an Icon, it has 3 weights, heavy armor
[1:48:58] <+MosesUnspoken> the three cups: 1 cup light, 2 cups medium, 3 cups heavy
[1:49:01] <%Speed1ines> nothing wrong with heavy armor
[1:49:03] <SainEdge> nioh 2 feels much more fair, burst counters alone do so much to work against one hits and stagger attacks
[1:49:03] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt it is either 1 pip 2, or 3
[1:49:05] <+DatAsuna> Unlike dark souls your weight percentage changes colour to tell you in advance if you're too heavy
[1:49:05] <%RayReborne> strength helps to get the buffs on Heavy armor
[1:49:06] <AzureFlame98> Also some attacks are just specifically designed to destroy your guard so you have to learn to recognize those by trial and error
[1:49:07] <%octavian_wolf> most ppl go light armor
[1:49:07] <+Jack8274> Yeah, that's correct
[1:49:07] <%Axellogic> most heavy armors need strength to wear
[1:49:08] <SirMcSlushy> Nuthin' wrong with heavy armor.
[1:49:09] <%valriot> Yeah that's normal
[1:49:09] <oda_flobunaga> 3 is heavy
[1:49:09] <+McCloud90> look at the armour portrait
[1:49:11] <+DatAsuna> just keep your weight green
[1:49:13] <amiavamp> Heavy is fine unless you're over 70% and trying to dodge around a lot
[1:49:13] <oda_flobunaga> 2 is medium
[1:49:15] <scrambledxeggz> It will say L, M, or H
[1:49:15] <%octavian_wolf> with other weapons
[1:49:16] <oda_flobunaga> 1 is light
[1:49:17] <TheMadBadger> No that's good, it's what you want for this kind of build :)
[1:49:17] <%Monkeyweed21> no thats good
[1:49:17] <%transporterthesequel> Strength is 100% Heavy, yes
[1:49:19] <Reborn2killu> the requirements are low
[1:49:23] <@Lion_kun> Heavier weight will reduce stamina recovery.
[1:49:26] <+DatAsuna> yellow if you're going for a tankier style
[1:49:26] <+zanz_san> I use cloth armor for light
[1:49:27] <%tank7013> It's the same dark souls mentality of gotta be light and roll everything
[1:49:28] <+theomnisoup> heavy armor just increases ki usage
[1:49:28] <shiny_prinny> i think medium armor is just more common, but heavy is totally ok
[1:49:31] <%A_Mighty_Walrus> I just wore whatever had better number
[1:49:35] <%valriot> Most people go light armour, since heavier means slower Ki regen, but you can tank like a motherfucker
[1:49:36] <+Jack8274> But you want 200 Toughness, it makes the game 100000x easier with Dark Souls 1 style poise
[1:49:43] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> you can wear as little or as much armor as you want as long as you are OK with your roll and movement speed
[1:49:54] <K1llingEdge> We need a Nioh Coach on call
[1:50:03] <EynoStiles> Pat doesnt want a coach, but he coached woolie and paige
[1:50:06] <+DatAsuna> @Jack8274 Yes but there is a 0% chance of that coming up tonight or even this month if he streamed it weekly
[1:50:08] <%Broand> No we don't killin edge
[1:50:14] <+MosesUnspoken> you can dodge most attacks so I always roll with light armor, plus light armor sets usually have great set bonuses
[1:50:16] <%RayReborne> heavier = slower stamina recovery and more damage reduction, lighter weight is bett
[1:50:26] <%RayReborne> holy fuck fat finger phone
[1:50:41] <%Speed1ines> it seems like everyone wants you to play exactly like them
[1:50:42] <AzureFlame98> Its kind of sad cause the actual combat is Nioh is super dope
[1:50:42] <%SirGO0SE> i could see a lot of *spends 20 minutes in guide* into *dies and doesnt get to what the guide said*
[1:50:46] <%Monkeyweed21> no the real nightmare is Dragon's Dogma and the World States in that game
[1:50:50] <K1llingEdge> i mean just for mechanics not to tell him what to level or use
[1:50:51] <+metalicblackcherry> have the goblins been slain yet?
[1:50:51] <%valriot> To be fair, that's more you than anything
[1:50:53] <%SWFanatic> Is breath of the wild better than dark souls?
[1:50:58] <+Jack8274> You need to get armor with a Kodoma Sensor
[1:51:00] <amiavamp> kodama is less frustrating with Kodama Sense
[1:51:06] <+DatAsuna> that's the celeste strawberry situation
[1:51:11] <SirMcSlushy> Kodama Sense will help ease that a lot
[1:51:12] <+Undenizen> So, i've never seen this game before. Is it good?
[1:51:12] <%octavian_wolf> yeah, I used video guides
[1:51:13] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> you can re-do levels, so you could at least go first time guide free
[1:51:14] <+athuramn> there are a lot of systems at play. and yeah, not every item has kodama sense and that's an early game annoyance
[1:51:17] <%valriot> Most of Nioh is gradually learned over time, and most of it is brute forced by just git gud and learning the mechanics
[1:51:17] <%SWFanatic> Is Farmville better than Spider Solitaire?
[1:51:20] <vVAstrAVv> kodama sense exists
[1:51:23] <%CappuccinoGuil> just blo
[1:51:28] <%RayReborne> and item drop rates
[1:51:31] <amiavamp> @SWFanatic please, there's no need to start WW3
[1:51:34] <%CappuccinoGuil> Wait, you look up written guides for hidden collectibles?
[1:51:36] <+DatAsuna> But an insiginificant amount
[1:51:37] <%MooseIsGoose> I think they are locked to the level
[1:51:53] <%SWFanatic> @amiavamp psaJpeg
[1:51:54] <vVAstrAVv> you get a kodama radar later
[1:51:54] <+Exicuren> No need, just get a equipment piece wth kodama sense
[1:51:58] <SirMcSlushy> I think I used to shoot the rocks from above.
[1:52:02] <%Monkeyweed21> How does Dragon's Dogma's fucked up world state quest system rank on the goblin meter
[1:52:02] <vVAstrAVv> several actually
[1:52:03] <Boya1995> unless you have kodama sense on a item don't bother actively searching for them
[1:52:04] <$realm_forge> It doesn’t seem like that great a game tbh
[1:52:05] <+tempestzephyr> pfft pat's too good for health
[1:52:09] <+DatAsuna> The maximum bonus they can give you would not even be 1 swing's worth of health
[1:52:16] <%JoshManVGH> Fucking restarts. Just the worst
[1:52:24] <+DatAsuna> that will happen 5 times
[1:52:26] <+Jack8274> Wait until Nioh 2, they get even more types
[1:52:26] <+DatAsuna> 8 with DLC
[1:52:27] <+athuramn> but at the same time, kodamas aren't a requirement either. you can think of it as, you could spend more time finding them and getting the benefits, or just go through the levels quickly enough that you'll hit the next act
[1:52:29] <fruit_pie_the_magician> They're locked to the level and after like the third level of the first game I stopped paying any attention to them
[1:52:29] <%darklordfodder> @swfanatic Asking if BotW is better than DS is like asking if ice cream is better than pizza.
[1:52:33] <+DatAsuna> So brace for that
[1:52:34] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> at least your Kodama progress carries over through playthroughs
[1:52:34] <@GeneralSCPatton> I believe your global Kodama total counts for the daily Twilight Missions
[1:52:41] <+HuoShengdi> kodama progress stays in NG+ at least
[1:52:47] <dickbuttwoman> It's an extremely good game, it's just that it's tutorial until endgame
[1:52:54] <HoboFlea> I gave up my 100% kodama run just 2 days ago in my own Nioh 2 game, after over an hour of trying to find out how to get the last one, while I was staring at it behind a wall.
[1:52:57] <amiavamp> @realm_forge it's the kind of game you can put 200 hours into and still not enjoy it but keep playing anyway, it's like eating doritos
[1:53:01] <%RealThiele> so what im hearing is this game is better if you just start it in NG+
[1:53:06] <oda_flobunaga> yep those
[1:53:09] <+DatAsuna> yeah it's stupid that you can even see those before endgame
[1:53:10] <@GeneralSCPatton> Yeah, they fucking hard
[1:53:11] <+curse85> whats better this or Sekiro?
[1:53:12] <%transporterthesequel> HE'S LEARNING
[1:53:14] <+Jack8274> Yeah those ones
[1:53:14] <%valriot> Kodamas are a bonus, but its really not gonna make a difference, its small bonus but that's about it
[1:53:14] <%JoshManVGH> The ones where the game mocks you for being weak, yes..
[1:53:14] <topiodonk> hell yeah pupper power
[1:53:15] <%Axellogic> You did it
[1:53:16] <%RayReborne> the first ones are like level 70 or so, they also randomly show uo
[1:53:23] <+HuoShengdi> twilight missions are for when you've cleared the game already
[1:53:24] <oda_flobunaga> Thank god
[1:53:24] <%Broand> you have the muscle memory for those Ki regens tho, good job on that
[1:53:27] <churropoppa> @curse85 sekiro
[1:53:29] <%SirGO0SE> what are the swords in the ground and why are there so many
[1:53:30] <Cosairen> that weapon do be living tho
[1:53:32] <%SirGO0SE> i thought they were bonfires
[1:53:32] <%Cozy90> does this game have a story?
[1:53:33] <+athuramn> they intended for this game to be played over multiple playthroughs, you're more than able to get them in a ng+
[1:53:34] <pixelkenj> i hate the RNG part of those twilight missions
[1:53:36] <dickbuttwoman> Just go ninja and enjoy the game. It has anti-mindgoblin tech
[1:53:36] <+tempestzephyr> sipsipDab
[1:53:37] <%valriot> Yo this next mission sucks btw lmao
[1:53:41] <%transporterthesequel> You kicked the shit out of that mission Pat
[1:53:43] <+marlborored5> @PatStaresAt what mind goblins does nioh activate?
[1:53:44] <+HuoShengdi> those are bloodstains
[1:53:47] <%JoshManVGH> @curse85 How much bullshit are you willing to put up with? And do you like rythem games?
[1:53:49] <+AutechreTwinAphex> hopefully stranger of paradise is still good as long as it is enough of a nioh asset flip
[1:53:50] <vVAstrAVv> @curse85 sekiro BUT nioh 2 >>>>>>>> sekiro
[1:53:51] <SainEdge> i did exactly one twilight mission in both nioh 1 and 2 and got trough the games just fine (for the most part) LUL
[1:53:52] <%transporterthesequel> Is next mission BIRD UP
[1:53:52] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> there, dual swords
[1:53:54] <+DatAsuna> yeah the umi bozu stage is one of the worst
[1:53:54] <%Axellogic> hey look dual swords
[1:53:56] <rReizs> red swords are bloodstains but you can summon them to kick their ass
[1:53:58] <shiny_prinny> hey some dual swords
[1:53:58] <%SirGO0SE> @HuoShengdi oh damn
[1:54:00] <%afronooch> @SirGO0SE other dead players. you can fight their ghosts
[1:54:01] <+DatAsuna> tl;dr everything hates fire here
[1:54:01] <%SirGO0SE> monkaS
[1:54:16] <oda_flobunaga> Woolie talked about the next  mission on the Podcast
[1:54:21] <knight_verse> Do the Dojo shit if you haven't.
[1:54:29] <%RayReborne> its not that much of a damage increase, maybe two or three swings worth
[1:54:30] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> now keep them until you get better ones, and if you are serious about dualies level skill
[1:54:34] <shiny_prinny> oh running speed is good
[1:54:35] <PwnyB> @Cozy90 Sorta? It's minimalistic. Gaijin washes up on shore and loses his spirit creature to english warmongery rock wizards.
[1:54:36] <%RayReborne> decrease*
[1:54:41] <%Axellogic> I was so happy when Nioh 2 let me change which skills a weapon scales with
[1:54:51] <%Axellogic> Dojos unlock with story progress
[1:54:55] <+skylerpilot> @curse85 totally different games, they may look similar but they don't offer the same experiences really
[1:54:55] <+curse85> i play alot og ninja gaiden 2 for 360 so i can put up with some shit lol
[1:54:56] <%valriot> So this is where Nioh 2 slaps, since weapon points are individual and based on use, and it scales up too based on enemy strength, so you can catch a weapon up fast
[1:54:56] <%octavian_wolf> yeah that shit is radical
[1:54:57] <SirMcSlushy> Love the kusarigama
[1:55:05] <@GeneralSCPatton> Honestly, some of the easiest gear comes from grinding red phantoms for dupes of what other people thought was good
[1:55:10] <%cvp5127> cheat
[1:55:11] <amiavamp> Dual Sword starts really weak and gets really good with abilities
[1:55:13] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt Water Sword
[1:55:14] <+theomnisoup> god of wind
[1:55:17] <%Cozy90> @PwnyB that sounds cool
[1:55:17] <theshillman> ok pat look, next mission is The Water Temple. Water Enemy HATE FIRE
[1:55:22] <%RayReborne> kill with weapon, get Samurai skill points as if you were low level
[1:55:23] <+DatAsuna> water sword is very OP, If you have onmyo
[1:55:26] <%valriot> Get Windstorm
[1:55:33] <Boya1995> this has big complexity and BIG numbers, but midling level design and some terrible bosses. Sekiro has imaculate level design and bosses but light on complexity
[1:55:38] <+Jack8274> That one is good
[1:55:40] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Dualies have sick counters and a game breaking spin move and draw cut
[1:55:41] <+DatAsuna> random slice sucks
[1:55:42] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt Water Sword is all you need
[1:55:43] <%SirGO0SE> they all look cool
[1:55:51] <+dante_must_die_exe> that doge shit is fucking lit
[1:55:52] <%MugenSandan> There's a dual blade skill where you do a roundhouse kick SPAM THE SHIT OUT OF IT
[1:55:53] <+DatAsuna> flux sucks
[1:55:57] <amiavamp> Water Sword is good and God of Wind
[1:56:00] <didgereedoodah> the parry skills are good
[1:56:01] <cartakus> You sound so sad
[1:56:05] <+Undenizen> Twitch is shitty for me and lots of audio gets a weird warbling effect. But i actually kinda like it. It sounds rad here.
[1:56:07] <+DatAsuna> useful
[1:56:10] <%valriot> God of Wind is good
[1:56:12] <%MooseIsGoose> God of wind was fine if I remember
[1:56:17] <+DatAsuna> Kicks are good for ki damage on humans
[1:56:18] <vVAstrAVv> whys he looking at dual swords with an odachi
[1:56:21] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Sign of the cross is the fucking best
[1:56:26] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Seriously, you sound miserable.
[1:56:26] <amiavamp> God of Wind eventually turns your jab into a killer combo
[1:56:26] <pixelkenj> oh boy
[1:56:26] <kingra> You sound it
[1:56:27] <%SirGO0SE> we're having fun if it makes you feel better <3
[1:56:28] <%Aleate> This screen gives me anxiety and I haven't even played this game
[1:56:28] <Cosairen> ! ego depleting !
[1:56:30] <+M0untain_wolf> These Goblins
[1:56:31] <%greasypete00> getting a little defeated by the game
[1:56:33] <pixelkenj> check the skill path for "Quick Change Scroll" Ninjutsu
[1:56:33] <LunarRemix> You sound like you're barely hanging. Maybe you should take a break?
[1:56:35] <%justcallmebobplease> Do you feel like you're retaining anything you learn?
[1:56:36] <%afronooch> cause dual swords are cool
[1:56:36] <oda_flobunaga> breathe, pet the cat, breathe
[1:56:39] <%SWFanatic> Pepridge farm remembers
[1:56:41] <+athuramn> I don't know if you have some particular obligation to finish this game but nioh 2 is such an incredible refinement over this game in every way, I wouldn't feel any ways about finishing this game
[1:56:41] <SpookyMooks> lytPETBUNS rotin for ya bud
[1:56:43] <+Jack8274> It  gets easier with time
[1:56:45] <%Axellogic> I type the bad
[1:56:46] <SpookyMooks> rootin
[1:56:49] <vVAstrAVv> pat is designed to suffer with this game
[1:56:50] <SainEdge> poor Pat FeelsBadMan
[1:56:50] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Yeah, I'd suggest a break from this goblin.
[1:56:50] <+dante_must_die_exe> we must be at the do or die moment for Nioh
[1:56:53] <FlashFrame> I've bounced off Nioh 1 soo many times ><
[1:57:01] <%sleepystardewfarmer> maybe take a break and get something to drink?
[1:57:02] <PwnyB> @Cozy90 It is. The idea is that iirc, Williams original spirit could sense the magic war rocks. English Rock Wizards want to warmonger because the fancy magic rocks only show up when blood and hate crystalizes into them over time. It's why the Oni all have horns made out of it and shit. Obv, I'm being a bit silly, but I aint too far off.
[1:57:03] <+Undenizen> You're doing it pat! the TRUE Oni are the mind goblins.
[1:57:05] <%Aleate> psaPorgmo
[1:57:05] <@GeneralSCPatton> It's weird how much I thrive in the dense number zone when we share so many other goblins
[1:57:06] <$realm_forge> The game kinda sucks from what I’ve seen so far
[1:57:16] <+skylerpilot> I would very much recommend just NOT doing the Sub Missions
[1:57:16] <+DatAsuna> Dojo mode is good for trying skills
[1:57:21] <%MooseIsGoose> Might as well use a few whet stones
[1:57:26] <%Aleate> What is that fucking awful noise
[1:57:27] <+Savarro> Hell I've platinumed both Niohs and looking at the skill screen here gives me PTSD
[1:57:30] <shiny_prinny> high stance
[1:57:30] <Cosairen> dual swords FeelsGoodMan
[1:57:33] <oda_flobunaga> Holt block and press triangle
[1:57:36] <FlashFrame> I feel like it has WAY too many systems going at one time.
[1:57:38] <SirMcSlushy> I enjoyed this game, though, took some deciding and figuring out.
[1:57:39] <fcKurl> I absolutely loved this game but it is hard to penetrate at the start
[1:57:42] <%valriot> yeyeyeyeye
[1:57:42] <+Kaiserzelcor> I have bounced off this game TWICE for the same reasons it bothers you. The item stuff is a huge cluster fuck
[1:57:43] <+theomnisoup> @Aleate the shrine noise
[1:57:43] <%SWFanatic> weeweeoowewooeow
[1:57:44] <%SirGO0SE> oh it just GOES
[1:57:44] <%Speed1ines> Everyone says that Nioh 2 will be better for Pat, but Yokai skills are going to make him fucking freak
[1:57:46] <%RayReborne> its REAL good
[1:57:47] <amiavamp> Use Water Sword against yokai once they're out of ki and it will stunlock them to death
[1:57:47] <%baka_sugoi> ora ora ora
[1:57:48] <+TopTieramisu> that's some vergil ass shit
[1:57:49] <@GeneralSCPatton> DAYUM
[1:57:50] <SainEdge> @athuramn yeah true, there arent even many big changes in nioh 2, but all the small ones make the game so much more enjoyable, its crazy
[1:57:54] <%SWFanatic> thats like the lightsaber kid
[1:57:55] <%valriot> Thats the boss melt skill
[1:57:56] <+zanz_san> the dojo let's you your item for free too
[1:58:00] <rReizs> kodamas havin a frat party
[1:58:00] <taquito_blade> hey Pat how the goblins?
[1:58:04] <+DatAsuna> If you use the onmyo shot spells, that attack can stunlock and zero  to death some enemies
[1:58:06] <+HuoShengdi> dual swords own
[1:58:08] <fcKurl> The combat is really so nice once it clicks, like the same dark souls feel but way more depth
[1:58:10] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Sign of the cross is, in my opinion, the best move in the game
[1:58:11] <Cosairen> having a fast and slow weapon is a great boon to have
[1:58:17] <%transporterthesequel> oh nooooo
[1:58:18] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> low stance is hyper fast, that's why I love fists in nioh 2 they feel great
[1:58:20] <%A_Mighty_Walrus> low stance low damage
[1:58:22] <%transporterthesequel> I TOLD YOU PAT
[1:58:22] <%octavian_wolf> not a lot of ki damage
[1:58:25] <%baka_sugoi> he healin
[1:58:32] <amiavamp> Low stance damage is garbage until you max out God of Wind
[1:58:33] <%valriot> Because dual swords have a low break value
[1:58:38] <%kknutson4> Sign of the Cross is best Dual  Swords skill
[1:58:40] <dickbuttwoman> No skill stat, also they do low damage
[1:58:48] <dickbuttwoman> They're good at setting status effects
[1:58:51] <+Jack8274> Coming from Odachi, the damage will be much lower than the number
[1:58:52] <%SWFanatic> ninja pizza
[1:58:56] <+athuramn> @kosorsomesaykosm_ fists are the absolute shit in nioh 2. so much stun on every hit
[1:58:58] <%octavian_wolf> think monster hunter
[1:58:58] <%SWFanatic> pizza vanish quickly without trace
[1:59:00] <Cosairen> they do combo
[1:59:00] <%MooseIsGoose> Might want to use some whet stones
[1:59:02] <+theomnisoup> dual swords are low dmg, high combo
[1:59:03] <amiavamp> Damage gets higher with more abilities
[1:59:07] <%RayReborne> the revenant has good equipment also
[1:59:13] <TheMadBadger> Dual Swords is a lot of small hits adding up to a few Odachi swings.
[1:59:14] <%tank7013> You've gone from big number to do combo
[1:59:15] <shiny_prinny> the revenant just blocked a lot too
[1:59:16] <+V3RTIGO_222> oh, I remember this stage
[1:59:16] <+DatAsuna> Water swords is best when they're out of ki, which is harder to do vs yokai
[1:59:16] <%SirGO0SE> seem like they do combo
[1:59:21] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt he was blocking your strikes and not taking damage because of it
[1:59:23] <+HuoShengdi> dual sword kick is one of the best ki damage abilities tho
[1:59:25] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Dual swords are low combo damage, but they have really nice spike damage, esecially with sign of the cross
[1:59:28] <+V3RTIGO_222> I also remember my bullshit ninja jutsu build
[1:59:33] <%Bt_Robot> Remember Pat, rapier does not do Greatsword damage
[1:59:33] <%RayReborne> YEAH
[1:59:38] <%valriot> Weapons have different "Break" values, which is basically how good they are at Ki damage and ignoring block
[1:59:42] <+theomnisoup> @athuramn trying to learn to get the perfect timings on the super fist combo is the best
[1:59:45] <%Axellogic> Yep thats why Stats dont matter much
[1:59:45] <+Savarro> I forget do dual swords do crazy poise damage or was that just the tonfa?
[1:59:47] <pixelkenj> big heavy weapon
[1:59:49] <%Speed1ines> High stance does more Ki damage
[1:59:50] <amiavamp> Break stat on the weapon determines ki damage when enemy blocks
[1:59:53] <%octavian_wolf> odachi does a ton of ki damage
[1:59:55] <Cosairen> heavy weapons do many ki damages
[1:59:55] <didgereedoodah> odachi does a lot of ki damage
[1:59:57] <shiny_prinny> Odachi and Axes do big damage per 1 swing
[1:59:59] <%MooseIsGoose> The odachi has the highest break point I think
[2:00:02] <+DatAsuna> "break" is your ki damage stat, and kicks do more ki damage
[2:00:03] <%greasypete00> I forget if there's perfect party in this game?
[2:00:06] <illicitdonut> Hi Pat, hi chat! How goes the goblins?
[2:00:06] <Reborn2killu> @patstaresat odachi does a ton of ki damage to blocking enemies
[2:00:09] <%valriot> Odachi is the 2nd best Break weapon, while Dual Swords are one of the lower end
[2:00:10] <%kknutson4> tongue is weak point
[2:00:11] <%Axellogic> they have shit vision
[2:00:14] <rReizs> BIG NUMBER / DO COMBO
[2:00:15] <vVAstrAVv> its almost like these 2 weapons are not the same
[2:00:15] <SinisterBroccoli> odachi is kinda op in this any way
[2:00:28] <+V3RTIGO_222> these monks are annoying
[2:00:29] <+DatAsuna> @illicitdonut It's an equippable skill, guard and attack in mid stance
[2:00:36] <Rionxgarland> can you respec in nioh?
[2:00:38] <amiavamp> Dual Sword against OP yokai is ballsy
[2:00:46] <+V3RTIGO_222> 360 tongue is yeesh
[2:00:46] <KeiPrime> yea you can respec
[2:00:47] <vVAstrAVv> you can
[2:00:48] <+Jack8274> @Rionxgarland Yes
[2:00:53] <%Speed1ines> I forgot that Odachi was an OP ass DLC weapon in Nioh 1
[2:00:54] <%kknutson4> Yes you use an item to respec
[2:00:55] <KeiPrime> pretty early too
[2:00:59] <+gustavozxd> @Rionxgarland yeah with a red book item
[2:00:59] <churropoppa> What that tongue do though
[2:01:05] <+Savarro> Man I hated the lightning version of these fuckers
[2:01:10] <+Jack8274> In nioh 2, you can even set builds and swap between them on the same character
[2:01:12] <SirMcSlushy> Dark Souls pat, roll towards the horizontal attack if ya gonna roll.
[2:01:16] <+gustavozxd> KOF15 beta is a LIE
[2:01:17] <rReizs> you can respec, and its the basis of builds cuz people just respect with a shitton of stat points to test new builds
[2:01:21] <vVAstrAVv> @churropoppa fire damage
[2:01:25] <+theomnisoup> you just missed
[2:01:29] <+DatAsuna> You didn't put it into the confusion state
[2:01:31] <%Monkeyweed21> you used it too far away
[2:01:32] <%valriot> Its good on bosses
[2:01:33] <%Axellogic> Were a little unlucky with it
[2:01:39] <SirMcSlushy> If you can make all the hits connect, its great. I do remember that one.
[2:01:39] <Talinu> I use it on bosses in a corner in Nioh 2.
[2:01:41] <+DatAsuna> You want to use onmyo to setup the water sword combo
[2:01:43] <Jolly_Adventurer> That move is OP if you can get them in a corner and they don't move back
[2:01:43] <didgereedoodah> much better with bosses
[2:01:45] <%MooseIsGoose> They have to be real close for that one it is better on bosses
[2:01:46] <%valriot> Use a branch
[2:01:49] <KeiPrime> that IS good on yokai after they're staminas gone tho..
[2:01:49] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> Himorogi Branch
[2:01:49] <pixelkenj> use an item to leave
[2:01:49] <%Speed1ines> it's good if you can get enemies against a wall too
[2:01:50] <primaryfire> it does cause some knockback that makes it hard to land most of it
[2:01:51] <amiavamp> You have to be standing at point blank range
[2:01:53] <%RayReborne> an item, the something branch
[2:01:54] <D_oe> What does Pat stare at??
[2:01:54] <+polothegreatest> Why?  What happened to kof?
[2:01:55] <cartakus> Reminder that there are combo mads of this game
[2:01:55] <%kknutson4> Isn't there a modifier that draws enemies to you with water sword skill?
[2:01:56] <%Axellogic> Himorogi branch in inventory
[2:01:56] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt divine branch item
[2:02:00] <solfuture> commit sudoku
[2:02:01] <Boya1995> gennerally blunt wepons are balanced to deal more stamina damage and bladed ones healt damage from what I recal
[2:02:01] <%Axellogic> DONT USE FRAGMENT
[2:02:03] <illicitdonut> @illicitdonut Equipable goblins sounds... inconvenient,
[2:02:06] <+DatAsuna> and also yeah, it does have to actually hit
[2:02:08] <vVAstrAVv> live via item
[2:02:09] <%Speed1ines> there's another item
[2:02:10] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> NOT FRAGMENT, BRACH
[2:02:10] <fruit_pie_the_magician> @PatStaresAt If nothing else I advise learning sign of the cross
[2:02:13] <%Axellogic> Branches are blue items and dont consume souls
[2:02:13] <%RayReborne> you dont have the Better branch aww fuck
[2:02:14] <vVAstrAVv> leave even
[2:02:15] <@GeneralSCPatton> There's a consumable to leave for free, and I think an infinite use Darksign equivalent
[2:02:16] <%Broand> There's another item which does it too iirc
[2:02:25] <K1llingEdge> water stance melts enemies if they are against a wall
[2:02:29] <%Bt_Robot> At least grab the wall
[2:02:30] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt did you remember to calculate the motion values of dual blades vs Greatsword
[2:02:34] <vVAstrAVv> branches
[2:02:36] <%RayReborne> oh he does ok cool
[2:02:40] <+zanz_san> you have a dojo in the world select too
[2:02:42] <amiavamp> @fruit_pie_the_magician I feel like Sign of the Cross is its own unique mind goblin because it doesn't like to activate reliably
[2:02:42] <didgereedoodah> there's another item but I don't think you have it yet
[2:02:48] <+HuoShengdi> can't you just use it from invenyory
[2:02:50] <%MooseIsGoose> Take a little break
[2:02:52] <vVAstrAVv> don't need to hotbar them
[2:02:53] <+athuramn> pat you're great <:
[2:02:55] <%valriot> This mission sucks LUL
[2:02:55] <pixelkenj> *ohno*
[2:02:58] <+HuoShengdi> don't need to put it on your bar
[2:03:02] <primaryfire> main mission time
[2:03:03] <%kknutson4> Oh no not this mission
[2:03:03] <theshillman> is pat dying yet?
[2:03:04] <+gustavozxd> red missions are the big ones
[2:03:04] <KeiPrime> yeah you can use it from the inventory
[2:03:04] <%greasypete00> it's a boss mission
[2:03:04] <sirrice77> Oh boy this one, try not to fall
[2:03:05] <%Axellogic> This is alot of people's most hated mission so uh good luck
[2:03:05] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> good one here
[2:03:07] <%SWFanatic> psaBig
[2:03:08] <solfuture> oh no
[2:03:09] <vnzuelandude> how's pats goblins doing
[2:03:09] <pixelkenj> put ninjutsu and spells on the hotbar instead
[2:03:10] <%greasypete00> I think
[2:03:12] <%MooseIsGoose> this mission is a stinker
[2:03:15] <gslayer14> oh boy
[2:03:16] <Profmcstevie> You gotta keep your strength up for these goblin streams pat, remember to drink and eat
[2:03:17] <fruit_pie_the_magician> No way I use it and the spinning dragon move almost exclusively
[2:03:17] <%RayReborne> this boss took me a few hours my first time, sucked shit
[2:03:19] <+theomnisoup> time for massive  goblins
[2:03:20] <+HuoShengdi> oh this is umi bozu
[2:03:20] <amiavamp> I like the area in this mission but the boss is ass
[2:03:21] <rReizs> the TRUE RAW of these DB are the same as the GS why aren't they hitting for hundreds per hit
[2:03:22] <@GeneralSCPatton> This one is ROUGH
[2:03:22] <fcKurl> u got this
[2:03:22] <%Broand> This is a big mission but you'll come back here later too, so don't sweat it too bad,
[2:03:22] <+gustavozxd> I like this mission atpFeelsBeardMan
[2:03:23] <didgereedoodah> the biggest enemy is the brightness
[2:03:24] <vVAstrAVv> oh god
[2:03:24] <%valriot> This is the worst mission in Nioh, Pat. Have fun LUL
[2:03:26] <oda_flobunaga> Woolie's least favorite mission incoming
[2:03:26] <%Monkeyweed21> welcome to the water temple
[2:03:29] <+MisdirectionErection> I love this mission
[2:03:29] <+HuoShengdi> yeahhhhhh
[2:03:30] <%SWFanatic> Am I so out of touch? No its the Nioh that is wrong.
[2:03:30] <vVAstrAVv> fuck this one
[2:03:31] <Cosairen> @vnzuelandude its uh going
[2:03:32] <+zanz_san> that's the gate keeper mission
[2:03:34] <gslayer14> u m i   b o z u
[2:03:36] <theshillman> pat for this one you will probably want the anmyo magic that gives your weapons fire damage
[2:03:37] <PwnyB> @pixelkenj Goblins are strong and numerous but Pat is big.
[2:03:38] <%G_Thunders> This is Blighttown without the poison
[2:03:42] <%kknutson4> Better stack up on fire talismans
[2:03:46] <%Bt_Robot> Ayi esta!
[2:03:47] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Ki pulses all around into draw cut, into spinning dragon, into ki pulse, into draw cut. Keeps you behind them too
[2:03:47] <@GeneralSCPatton> Move and zoom
[2:03:50] <KeiPrime> oh umibozu.. lol This one is FUN
[2:03:50] <%Axellogic> Only ranged wepaon that locks you in place is cannons
[2:03:53] <dickbuttwoman> Go big bow, or rifle
[2:03:53] <%octavian_wolf> ye
[2:03:53] <%Axellogic> yeah
[2:03:53] <%MooseIsGoose> should be
[2:03:54] <%afronooch> ye
[2:03:55] <didgereedoodah> you can pause btw
[2:03:55] <Bonebagmel> yes
[2:03:56] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> ye
[2:03:57] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> yeq
[2:03:57] <%Axellogic> you can pause too
[2:03:57] <%kknutson4> Sure
[2:03:57] <SirMcSlushy> Should be
[2:03:59] <shiny_prinny> just pause, you can pause
[2:03:59] <+DatAsuna> probably
[2:03:59] <+Savarro> yeah
[2:03:59] <%doomunderthestairs> yea looks fine
[2:04:00] <primaryfire> sure
[2:04:00] <%croutonian> we'll protect you
[2:04:00] <%baka_sugoi> toyally
[2:04:01] <Xelhesia> yea
[2:04:01] <rReizs> shrine of amana
[2:04:01] <%RayReborne> open menu then Options for pause
[2:04:02] <amiavamp> There's a pause in the menu somewhere
[2:04:05] <%tanarath> Pause
[2:04:06] <theshillman> seems safe
[2:04:06] <%Axellogic> yes when on menu
[2:04:07] <Profmcstevie> Sure, you can just pause
[2:04:08] <pixelkenj> theres a double pause
[2:04:09] <%Bt_Robot> P A U S E
[2:04:09] <%RealThiele> ill watch
[2:04:10] <%MugenSandan> can't you full pause in Nioh 1
[2:04:10] <%Axellogic> press options
[2:04:11] <%RayReborne> start button
[2:04:11] <Bonebagmel> yes you can
[2:04:11] <shiny_prinny> menu -> options
[2:04:13] <%kknutson4> start then back button
[2:04:15] <oda_flobunaga> back
[2:04:16] <%afronooch> start again
[2:04:16] <SunsetJack> Pause then select?
[2:04:17] <+gustavozxd> look down
[2:04:18] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Abused that combo all the way through both games
[2:04:19] <vVAstrAVv> theres a pause
[2:04:20] <shiny_prinny> menu -> options button
[2:04:25] <oda_flobunaga> Select
[2:04:27] <SainEdge> yes you can
[2:04:30] <%baka_sugoi> BREAK TIME
[2:04:30] <vVAstrAVv> hit pause button in a menu
[2:04:31] <SpookyMooks> beby time
[2:04:37] <PwnyB> Welp, time to make tea.
[2:04:38] <%cvp5127> i think hes having fun
[2:04:38] <amiavamp> Round 1 is over, but can Pat win Round 2?
[2:04:39] <rReizs> INVADED BY DARK SPIRIT MIND GOBLIN SQUAD
[2:04:48] <%tanarath> Time for Zangief to be a big baby
[2:04:57] <+gustavozxd> attacks that move you forward don't actually let you fall down, knowing that helps with this mission
[2:05:04] <+gustavozxd> especially the boss
[2:05:18] <%RayReborne> hes gone dude lol
[2:05:27] <oda_flobunaga> I love how they fixed the boss of this mission in 2
[2:05:52] <cartakus> Kinda funny seeing pat have a hard time with the games number when I beat it 2 times and still don't care about it
[2:05:52] <+gustavozxd> so you attack the boss and then press the dodge without inputting a direction
[2:05:55] <rReizs> the important thing is we know, and we can tell him when it is relevant later
[2:06:40] <+DatAsuna> Yokai work on a different system for ki and it seems like that's gonna take a while to pick up on
[2:06:42] <+gustavozxd> I was honestly kind of surprised with how people hated this level so much, I didn't have any real problem with it
[2:06:45] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I mean at least this level looks cool, and the boss isn't until the end of it
[2:06:51] <+DatAsuna> He'll probably hate the beacon thing in this level
[2:07:00] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Just gotta learn to dodge the water laser
[2:07:06] <@GeneralSCPatton> @gustavozxd It just takes so long to scrape, and all the falling
[2:07:15] <amiavamp> The best part about the boss is that it can 1shot you with its laser beam the instant you walk into the arena if you're unlucky lmao
[2:07:17] <+DatAsuna> @gustavozxd I think it's a problem nioh 2 has really badly too, the levels are very gray and brown with low contrast and washed out lighting.
[2:07:17] <oda_flobunaga> The level is fine the boss arena is BS
[2:07:24] <Profmcstevie> The killing monsters part is where Pat is most comfortable, he'll be fiiine
[2:07:24] <+Savarro> I didn't know the beacons were a thing and got wrecked
[2:07:29] <+DatAsuna> It makes everything look flat and samey, including the death pits in water
[2:08:18] <amiavamp> The boss would be 10x easier if there wasn't that one section of it that's broken and dumps into the water
[2:08:21] <fruit_pie_the_magician> The water shrine level? but this is like the best looking level
[2:08:41] <+gustavozxd> @DatAsuna yeah I can see that, just complaining that you fall because you weren't paying attention though... seems dumb
[2:08:43] <+DatAsuna> eh, agree to disagree
[2:08:49] <@Lion_kun> I was always very meh on Nioh but Nioh 2 was such a massive improvement on every level, I played that game more than any other game in 2020
[2:08:55] <+HuoShengdi> I like how the first boss in nioh 2's first dlc is this guy but done better
[2:09:07] <+DatAsuna> @gustavozxd Well this level combiens that with tons of narrow platforms
[2:09:15] <+DatAsuna> It is still a bit of a scrubquote
[2:09:20] <+DatAsuna> but also it's not a great level either
[2:09:28] <+Savarro> If 2020 wasn't so stacked Nioh 2 would've easily been my goty
[2:09:57] <%RayReborne> nioh 2 is just way better about its levels and new mechanics to make it easier to not get overwhelmed by enemies
[2:09:57] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[2:10:06] <@Lion_kun> I enjoyed Nioh 2 more than Ghost of Tsushima
[2:10:06] <oda_flobunaga> I never completed Nioh 1, got to Maria and stopped.  I've beaten Nioh 2 with at least 4 or 5 characters
[2:10:12] <%RayReborne> yokai abilities fucking rule
[2:10:14] <+DatAsuna> @Lion_kun meanwhile I put 300 hours into 1, played it ps4 and PC, but then nioh 2 dropped out, I beat it in about 50 hoursand then hard dropped it forever
[2:10:15] <@Lion_kun> And GoT was a great game.
[2:10:29] <+Savarro> Like the burst counter is crazy how effective it is
[2:10:50] <%SWFanatic> Hurty Sand
[2:10:50] <@Ranryu692> hurty sand
[2:10:51] <%doomunderthestairs> the hurty sand
[2:10:54] <%RealThiele> hurty sand!
[2:10:54] <+DatAsuna> granted part of that is me being less into souls games generallynow
[2:10:55] <SirMcSlushy> At least coat that shit on some strawberries
[2:10:55] <%doomunderthestairs> the return
[2:10:56] <+RayReborne> HURTY SAND RETURNS
[2:10:58] <%baka_sugoi> HURTY SAND PogChamp
[2:10:58] <%MooseIsGoose> eat that surgar
[2:11:00] <@QueequegTheater> HURTY SAND
[2:11:02] <ovan20> trow the sugar down the drain D:
[2:11:03] <%Broand> Pain grit
[2:11:05] <+Kaiserzelcor> Wait... sugar by itself?
[2:11:06] <+gustavozxd> I beat nioh 2 all the way through DLC but I think I played so much 1 that I didn't get as hooked
[2:11:08] <Profmcstevie> The ladies need that hurty
[2:11:08] <akitanito> paige is too powerful
[2:11:19] <marrowjuice> wait, like out of the jar???
[2:11:20] <+theomnisoup> did she find it on the trash lid too ?
[2:11:20] <%baka_sugoi> psaDogchamp "NP FATHER"
[2:11:20] <%doomunderthestairs> @Kaiserzelcor yes
[2:11:22] <%RealThiele> cinnamon with hurty sand is delicious
[2:11:30] <%RayReborne> HINT HINT
[2:11:31] <Cosairen> oh i love this mission its a stinky one
[2:11:32] <@QueequegTheater> Reminder that Dark Souls 2 is still the best game of all time
[2:11:34] <Profmcstevie> ooh speak sweet nothing to me guuuurl
[2:11:34] <SirMcSlushy> Oh I remember this level/boss.
[2:11:39] <shiny_prinny> Fire amulets are consumables
[2:11:49] <+DatAsuna> @gustavozxd same nioh 2 is just missing the magic
[2:11:51] <didgereedoodah> this one took me so long when I first did it
[2:11:51] <+Savarro> Nioh 2 is still the only game I've ever gone back to the DAY new dlc dropped. it was all so good
[2:11:55] <%RayReborne> hint hint pat Fire good Kappa
[2:12:20] <SirMcSlushy> Love the disembodies in this game.
[2:12:22] <Profmcstevie> ANIME SWORD FLAIL, hell yeah
[2:12:25] <%RayReborne> Thats what the Lady gave you
[2:12:33] <amiavamp> Transplant Nioh's combat to another game that isn't designed to be stress and you have another GOTY
[2:12:34] <sirrice77> @Savarro i actually bought all the nioh 2 dlc when the last one came out and never tried it lol, maybe i should
[2:12:38] <+DatAsuna> @QueequegTheater 1 vs 1 in eleum loyce
[2:12:39] <%RealThiele> this inventory is fucked
[2:12:40] <%RayReborne> so its Screaming at you essentially
[2:12:43] <%Axellogic> @Savarro I do with the DLC werent speedrunning sequel ideas
[2:12:52] <PwnyB> Honestly, Onmyo is pretty baller on its own OR paired with a weapon.
[2:13:03] <@QueequegTheater> @DatAsuna SM?
[2:13:14] <@GeneralSCPatton> Flint is a key item for lighting beacons? I honestly forget that part.
[2:13:21] <%Djinnazz> Those are upgrade mats
[2:13:22] <%RayReborne> equipped fire amulet?
[2:13:23] <+gustavozxd> so this is the PC version of the game or what?
[2:13:29] <@Lion_kun> Oh boy, it's this level.
[2:13:30] <+Savarro> @sirrice77 They're very much worth it, but also VERY HARD like holy shit
[2:13:30] <%Axellogic> @GeneralSCPatton yes
[2:13:34] <+DatAsuna> One of the biggest problems with Nioh 1 DLC is it was balanced for people who kept playing the ednagme and grinding between DLC drops, not for people who pick up the definitive edition and just go right into it
[2:13:34] <didgereedoodah> yeah flint is for the beacons
[2:13:40] <amiavamp> Amulet is a consumable
[2:13:41] <%bravebravesrobin> hooray for drinking for charity tonight! Also, master the ki pulse; essentially your most important move Cheer500
[2:13:42] <%RayReborne> you can hot equip for instant use
[2:13:44] <shiny_prinny> the flint is key item, fire amulets are consumables
[2:13:50] <+muushies> weird to think this team is making a final fantasy game
[2:13:53] <Cosairen> resin time :)
[2:13:56] <amiavamp> Flint is just a key item
[2:13:57] <%RayReborne> Flintndoes nothing lol
[2:13:58] <Blank9> mmm yummy hair
[2:14:00] <%Broand> Flint will do its thing automatically
[2:14:02] <+DatAsuna> @QueequegTheater what's you're favourite DS2 fashion set?
[2:14:07] <Cosairen> flint is a quest item iirc
[2:14:09] <%Axellogic> no flint is a key item you dont use it
[2:14:09] <didgereedoodah> flint is a key item
[2:14:12] <+DatAsuna> *your
[2:14:19] <amiavamp> Now to fight man's worst enemy, the camera
[2:14:26] <+gustavozxd> @muushies they're like half the reason I'm excited for it LUL. The other is the dialogue of course
[2:14:34] <@QueequegTheater> @QueequegTheater Shadow helm, Faraam armor/gloves, Lucatiel pants
[2:14:37] <gslayer14> POTTERY NOT RESPECTED
[2:14:44] <SatChamp> helo
[2:14:46] <+Savarro> I remember the first piece of Nioh 1 dlc being ridiculously difficult, and I only got partway through the 2nd before giving it up. The difficulty spike was nuts
[2:14:48] <%RayReborne> Umi Bozu
[2:14:49] <%Cozy90> no scoped
[2:14:49] <%cvp5127> LUL

[2:14:54] <Xelhesia> flan?
[2:14:54] <Profmcstevie> See, the killing DOES soothe Pat
[2:14:54] <Cosairen> ahahaha its slime time
[2:14:56] <%valriot> LUL
[2:14:58] <%cvp5127> a good time
[2:14:59] <+theomnisoup> Use fire on these guys
[2:15:02] <%RealThiele> heartless
[2:15:02] <@GeneralSCPatton> You should crush some revenants once the area is clear. That's a lot of purple gear.
[2:15:03] <ovan20> LUL
[2:15:09] <%valriot> Water go up
[2:15:11] <+gustavozxd> remember, water is weak to fire
[2:15:12] <Cosairen> ARISEN IT HATES FIRE
[2:15:12] <sirrice77> @PatStaresAt slimes are only able to be hurt after they miss and you hit the glowy bit
[2:15:19] <+DatAsuna> @QueequegTheater throne watcher + ivory crown for me
[2:15:22] <%MooseIsGoose> weak to fire
[2:15:25] <Blank9> odachi strong
[2:15:31] <%Monkeyweed21> THEIR KIND HATE ICE AND FIRE BOTH ARISEN
[2:15:36] <vVAstrAVv> you can zoom while aiming slightly
[2:15:38] <%valriot> LUL
[2:15:41] <fruit_pie_the_magician> If you do a high stance attack you'll hit him in the ball and he hates it
[2:15:42] <%Broand> slime that hate fire, pretty normal
[2:15:42] <Profmcstevie> Water is weak to fire? Is fire weak to water too?
[2:15:46] <%valriot> Jabaited
[2:15:51] <%tank7013> Very cute game LUL
[2:15:51] <SirMcSlushy> Souls moment
[2:15:53] <@GeneralSCPatton> The classic Dark Souls corner
[2:15:58] <%Djinnazz> Yes
[2:16:04] <+gustavozxd> guys stop quoting dragons dogma its making me want to play iiiit
[2:16:05] <+DatAsuna> Kick is your friend
[2:16:07] <SpookyMooks> there we go
[2:16:09] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> you have enemy sensor, use it!
[2:16:14] <+Savarro> Nioh fucking loves it jebaits
[2:16:16] <amiavamp> @Profmcstevie Water is weak to fire here because the legend for that yokai goes that they don't like smoking or something like that
[2:16:21] <+DatAsuna> @gustavozxd they ill like fire arisen
[2:16:23] <SpookyMooks> just chillin
[2:16:24] <Blank9> god I love every weapon in this game
[2:16:27] <SirMcSlushy> much kick
[2:16:34] <@Lion_kun> Tonfas ftw
[2:16:34] <%MugenSandan> HE'S BEGINNING TO BELIEVE
[2:16:46] <SpookyMooks> good
[2:16:52] <shiny_prinny> good dog
[2:16:55] <%SWFanatic> MercyWing1 psaDogchamp MercyWing2
[2:16:58] <+DatAsuna> It's a shame most of the new weapons in 2 are so extra with their movesets
[2:16:58] <+gustavozxd> careful walking on these edges, they're finnicky
[2:17:02] <%RealThiele> touched grass and grabbed poop
[2:17:02] <%RayReborne> Souls glowing, level up available ☺
[2:17:03] <%MooseIsGoose> He is adapting
[2:17:03] <Profmcstevie> Now that you've let the numbers settle and the action is present, it's gamer hours
[2:17:05] <$Futurecity10> oh he's at this fucking mission
[2:17:07] <%Cozy90> psaDab psaDogchamp
[2:17:09] <%Monkeyweed21> ironic since usually Zangief makes people more tilted
[2:17:12] <+Savarro> Were to tonfas good in 1? Cause they ruled in 2
[2:17:14] <PwnyB> Gief solves Grief.
[2:17:16] <+gustavozxd> I once fell by walking AWAY from the edge LUL it was pretty funny
[2:17:22] <knight_verse> Having never played this game while currently playing Nioh 2 O jist realized that this is canonically taking place at almost the same time as the story in Nioh 2
[2:17:26] <Blank9> @DatAsuna I practically mained fists, and I barely understand them
[2:17:31] <%RealThiele> elmo ghost
[2:17:41] <amiavamp> @Savarro they're much better in 2 because of the change where you can permanently debuff an enemy's ki
[2:17:46] <+HuoShengdi> actually Nioh 2 is a prequel
[2:17:47] <vVAstrAVv> pat you missed big clue
[2:17:50] <@GeneralSCPatton> R3 to zoom?
[2:17:58] <PwnyB> @Savarro Ye. Felt stronger in 2 but, bear in mind I don't do all the NG+ bullshit. I do one and done runs. lol
[2:18:11] <Blank9> @Savarro They absolutely shred ki, but do sorta bad damage until then
[2:18:14] <+HuoShengdi> this is like 25 years after the start of Nioh 2
[2:18:20] <%tank7013> @knight_verse Have you met the englishman yet?
[2:18:20] <vVAstrAVv> @generalscpatton no the guy talking about fire
[2:18:21] <%MooseIsGoose> Shrine
[2:18:28] <%RealThiele> none of these guys believe in pants
[2:18:32] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> kodama!
[2:18:38] <%Monkeyweed21> Tonfas 4 life
[2:18:39] <%transporterthesequel> Oh this is legit one of my favorite levels in the game
[2:18:40] <%RayReborne> hey he has backstab
[2:18:40] <%tank7013> @knight_verse Sorry irishman
[2:18:43] <+DatAsuna> @knight_verse only the end of nioh 2 overlaps with nioh 1
[2:18:49] <ovan20> pyromBlinder
[2:18:50] <SirMcSlushy> Think I saw something in one of the boxes ya broke
[2:18:51] <+Savarro> @amiavamp oh yeah I mained them in 2. had a build that healed me for mid & low stance damage dealt. Wrecked through the whole game LUL
[2:18:59] <%RayReborne> Tonfas are just dumb fun
[2:19:05] <%RayReborne> love em
[2:19:12] <knight_verse> @tank7013 No, I just met and am currently figthing the "Vergil" for the first time.
[2:19:13] <%Axellogic> @PatStaresAt  fun fact did you know if you stand nuetral and sheathe your swords you flourish your blood off your weapons
[2:19:13] <$Futurecity10> it is crazy
[2:19:17] <%Monkeyweed21> its not vital
[2:19:19] <SirMcSlushy> Up to you, though if you DO, get dat Kodama Sense first.
[2:19:22] <%MooseIsGoose> No it is a shrine
[2:19:22] <+gustavozxd> you could but they're a little hard to find sometimes
[2:19:22] <exas45> they're jinjos or whatever
[2:19:24] <amiavamp> This level is massive, you'll be a while getting all the kodamas even with kodama sense
[2:19:24] <%RayReborne> I would cuz Item drop rates increase per kodama
[2:19:24] <primaryfire> we would recommend against replaying levels 3 times to get them all lol
[2:19:25] <+DatAsuna> @DatAsuna I understand the use of each stance but I found the drunken boxer moveset to be so tryhard it just made me think of those awful "assassin's creed kung fu fights prince persia" youtube videos lmao
[2:19:26] <ovan20> get the ones you find, but they are not mandatory
[2:19:28] <Profmcstevie> They're a bonus
[2:19:30] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> if it means not melting your brain, skip em
[2:19:31] <BigYanno> would the kodamas, in theory, be there in post game?
[2:19:36] <shiny_prinny> after a certain point, i just come back when i have a Kodama Sensor
[2:19:36] <%RayReborne> shrine
[2:19:37] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> shrine
[2:19:37] <Blank9> just get kodama you see or want
[2:19:39] <%MooseIsGoose> It is a second shrine
[2:19:41] <+HuoShengdi> yes
[2:19:43] <%BinaryFireball> pat part of your goblins is that sane things sound crazy
[2:19:44] <+DatAsuna> green dots are kodama
[2:19:47] <didgereedoodah> try to find them but it's not a huge deal if you miss some
[2:19:47] <%MooseIsGoose> lol
[2:19:48] <%afronooch> rip
[2:19:48] <oda_flobunaga> its a shrine
[2:19:48] <a_mad_dragon_> 800 kodamas
[2:19:50] <NemokillerV> LUL
[2:19:51] <theshillman> a shrine?

[2:19:55] <%baka_sugoi> csbeastSetIn LUL NotLikeThis
[2:19:56] <+polothegreatest> OSFrog
[2:19:56] <+gustavozxd> this level LUL

[2:19:58] <%Broand> oh yeah watch your step
[2:19:58] <SirMcSlushy> we've all been there for sure
[2:19:58] <DarkestDom> LUL
[2:19:59] <+athuramn> that's okay
[2:19:59] <+HuoShengdi> kodamas can be obtained in NG+ as well
[2:19:59] <%RayReborne> Thats gonna happen A LOT man, it did for me
[2:20:00] <primaryfire> bitch cant even swim
[2:20:00] <theshillman> LUL LUL
[2:20:00] <marrowjuice> LUL
[2:20:00] <%Monkeyweed21> WELCOME TO THE WATER TEMPLE
[2:20:01] <%JoshManVGH> Life is fuck
[2:20:02] <vVAstrAVv> get just 1 lol
[2:20:02] <+HuoShengdi> lmao
[2:20:02] <%BinaryFireball> you don't need all the kodamas
[2:20:02] <%afronooch> this level sucks
[2:20:02] <+DatAsuna> First of several times that will happen
[2:20:04] <@Lion_kun> Pat, be careful where you step.
[2:20:07] <Profmcstevie> Watch that first step Kappa
[2:20:09] <%RealThiele> is nioh a rat?
[2:20:09] <@Lion_kun> Pat, watch out.
[2:20:11] <%baka_sugoi> S A L T
[2:20:12] <theshillman> this level is such a dick
[2:20:13] <%greasypete00> as someone who went for every kodama and then said fuck it, don't get every kodama
[2:20:14] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Kodamas are mostly useless, if you intend to farm a level, yeah get some kodamas. if you see one, get him, but otherwise the kodama can fuck off
[2:20:17] <+DatAsuna> floor boss
[2:20:18] <AoiRob> hey pat btw watch where you're walking
[2:20:18] <%greasypete00> LUL
[2:20:20] <ovan20> this is my favorite level LUL
[2:20:25] <mr_catsup> Legit my only complaint with this game I hate that shit
[2:20:27] <PwnyB> Help. It's again. NotLikeThis
[2:20:31] <vVAstrAVv> 1 kodama
[2:20:35] <%Bt_Robot> Remember No Man's Wharf?  This is worse
[2:20:39] <vVAstrAVv> GOTTEEEEM
[2:20:40] <@Lion_kun> This level has a lot of pitfalls.
[2:20:53] <+DatAsuna> water monsters hate fire, or as a DD Pawn would say
[2:20:58] <+DatAsuna> "Fire works well, arisen!"
[2:20:59] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> the slime's glowing skill is their weak point, it is exposed after they do the slam attack
[2:21:03] <SpookyMooks> sploosh
[2:21:06] <%RayReborne> if you use your onmyo magic point to get a Fire Talisman they regenerate on death, so you always have some
[2:21:06] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Weirdly this is like the one level where I like the sub mission version more, it takes place at sunset and looks nicer
[2:21:06] <amiavamp> I found Odachi really good for these types of levels because it doesn't move around as much, at least compared to dual swords
[2:21:15] <+HuoShengdi> kodamas start mattering slightly more when you want to farm a boss for his goddamn skills
[2:21:17] <+gustavozxd> maybe it's because I was having so much fun overall but these falls never bothered me, specifically, they always had me laugh out loud
[2:21:27] <+HuoShengdi> farming skills suuuuuucks
[2:21:32] <Blank9> odachi is an excellent weapon with anything
[2:21:40] <%HotSauceFiend> Hello just got back from a date. Why is Pat playing Nioh? Isn't this a great game?
[2:21:44] <%RayReborne> man these guys are Beefier in 2
[2:21:44] <%CatastropheCorvid> @DatAsuna WOLVES HUNT IN PACKS
[2:21:45] <SirMcSlushy> Peck and poke
[2:21:55] <Profmcstevie> as long as it doesn't feel bad
[2:21:55] <+DatAsuna> Personally I would use th eodachi on big oni, swords on human
[2:21:56] <LunarRemix> Are you enjoying yourself?
[2:21:56] <%tanarath> But it looks great
[2:21:57] <+HuoShengdi> at least you can do it on NG when you're rocking NG+4 gear
[2:22:04] <%HotSauceFiend> What is the goblin here?
[2:22:09] <vVAstrAVv> @hotsaucefiend it is but GOBALINS
[2:22:20] <Blank9> this whole game is goblins
[2:22:23] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Some of the dual sword skills make most of the normal moves way less useful
[2:22:27] <amiavamp> everything is goblins
[2:22:30] <+gustavozxd> this whole game is a goblin bunker
[2:22:31] <%baka_sugoi> psaGoblin
[2:22:32] <%tank7013> Nioh IS a goblin
[2:22:35] <%Broand> Try out the kusarigama sometime, that moveset is WILD
[2:22:39] <+DatAsuna> @HotSauceFiend stats, minmaxing, collectibles
[2:22:40] <vVAstrAVv> @hotsaucefiend menus and not using guides
[2:22:44] <%RealThiele> goblin menu
[2:22:47] <@QueequegTheater> Is this Sekiro
[2:22:48] <Profmcstevie> Just do what you did with dishonoured, get more angry than stressed at the system :)
[2:22:50] <Blank9> consumables, infinite game mechanics, diablo loot that's not needed
[2:22:51] <SirMcSlushy> It really is, should try it out just to try out tho
[2:22:52] <%CatastropheCorvid> @PatStaresAt One stream, you should make the Goblin answering people that ask what the Goblin is.
[2:22:54] <+Undenizen> so, why are you murdering a church?
[2:22:55] <%HotSauceFiend> I understand not starting over, but why would you....need to start over in Nioh? It's just a wierd weapon learning curve
[2:22:55] <primaryfire> the kusarigama is so cool man
[2:22:57] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Starting this game over sounds like hell anyway
[2:22:57] <%HotSauceFiend> oh and that
[2:22:58] <%MrChapwhit> F
[2:23:00] <+DatAsuna> Kusari fits a similar niche as dual swords
[2:23:01] <%tanarath> Everything or nothing is helpful, nothing is clear, items are everywhere
[2:23:01] <Kain5707> good
[2:23:02] <SirMcSlushy> WELP
[2:23:02] <%RayReborne> Its obtuse Pat you aint dumb for not knowing
[2:23:04] <+gustavozxd> atpRtsd atpRtsd atpRtsd atpRtsd atpRtsd
[2:23:05] <+polothegreatest> doodBait PJSalt
[2:23:05] <+DatAsuna> Woolie was a kusari main
[2:23:06] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> SLOPPPPPAY
[2:23:06] <PwnyB> Hilarious.
[2:23:08] <DarkestDom> LUL
[2:23:08] <dickbuttwoman> Kusarigama + Ninjutsu is the BEST
[2:23:11] <@Lion_kun> Pat, watch out.
[2:23:13] <+HuoShengdi> WATER
[2:23:13] <SirMcSlushy> Gonna try it out? :p
[2:23:14] <+gustavozxd> this level atpRtsd atpRtsd atpRtsd
[2:23:15] <%RealThiele> SLOPPEH
[2:23:17] <+DatAsuna> yup
[2:23:17] <+Savarro> I was such a basic bitch in Nioh 1, only used the sword. LUL
[2:23:18] <a_mad_dragon_> SeemsGood
[2:23:21] <@QueequegTheater> SLOPPEH
[2:23:21] <dickbuttwoman> Ninjutsu has anti-mind-goblin-tech
[2:23:21] <%Birdigalore> Bitch can't even swim
[2:23:23] <+gustavozxd> just be carfeul
[2:23:24] <KaironFortressKnight> it's not great
[2:23:25] <%afronooch> yeah this level made me stop playing for months
[2:23:25] <PwnyB> @dickbuttwoman This.
[2:23:26] <@GeneralSCPatton> The water is hungry
[2:23:27] <%tank7013> @HotSauceFiend Being overwhelmed by all of the info you it seems like you have to retain
[2:23:28] <%HotSauceFiend> @DatAsuna that just sounds like a typical RPG
[2:23:32] <Blank9> you can always pick the kusari up, all stats are worth bumping to soft caps
[2:23:34] <srv4254> this level is fucked
[2:23:35] <SirMcSlushy> xD
[2:23:35] <dickbuttwoman> All the ninjutsu items are become estus
[2:23:37] <primaryfire> kusarigama also makes you level dex which lets you use ninjutsu
[2:23:39] <scrambledxeggz> You can do it I believe in you!!!
[2:23:40] <+HuoShengdi> my char in nioh 2 is sword + dual sword
[2:23:42] <SirMcSlushy> Any level with pit falls can be oof.
[2:23:45] <+DatAsuna> @HotSauceFiend Kinda yeah
[2:23:48] <%RayReborne> i mean all games have their one level, dont they?
[2:23:49] <%Djinnazz> Lol rip
[2:23:49] <scrambledxeggz> NEVER GIVE UP!!!!
[2:23:49] <%hax_metatron> Bruh why can’t Team Ninja hire level designers that are not COMPLETE ass
[2:23:50] <vVAstrAVv> blind :p
[2:23:52] <+HuoShengdi> I am very basic
[2:23:57] <+polothegreatest> Like OOT water temple
[2:23:59] <Profmcstevie> Sometimes you come back to a game at the start of it's Blighttown, you can never know
[2:24:03] <+HuoShengdi> tbf I'm kinda running a cosplay build
[2:24:06] <amiavamp> @Savarro Yeah but the sword is the most legit weapon, probably the hardest to get good with overall lol. At least in Nioh 2, it felt really underpowered.
[2:24:06] <vVAstrAVv> WE KNOW IT SUCKS LOL
[2:24:08] <+Undenizen> man, i really hate water in games that you just fall through and instantly die. they couldn't at least put a drowning animation?
[2:24:13] <+athuramn> second game is just way more engaging imo, not to say the first one's bad or anything
[2:24:16] <+DatAsuna> @SirMcSlushy and double oof when the pit is filled with black water that looks a lot like all the dark brown floors
[2:24:18] <%hax_metatron> Like even in Nioh 2, the level design was EASILY the weakest part. It’s so trash
[2:24:26] <+vvitchguy> enbPraise
[2:24:27] <fruit_pie_the_magician> SIGN OF CROSS YO
[2:24:35] <+DatAsuna> Nioh 2 has awful level design IMHO
[2:24:38] <%HotSauceFiend> Yeah Nioh has a crazy learning curve. But I enjoyed going through it. Pat already has the two best weapon types on hand
[2:24:38] <+HuoShengdi> @amiavamp sword gets much much better once you farm up some of the skills for it
[2:24:42] <+HuoShengdi> true and through owns
[2:24:43] <%SWFanatic> Thats real neato
[2:24:44] <%CatastropheCorvid> @Savarro 3 SWOOORD AWOOO!
[2:24:46] <%Djinnazz> Y’all need to be more aware of your surroundings
[2:24:49] <+DatAsuna> It's way more prone to have you running in circles on big brown loops
[2:24:52] <Profmcstevie> If Nioh is considered unremarkable by level design, do ANY Team Ninjas games have good level design?
[2:24:59] <+Savarro> @amiavamp yeah after my tonfa run I tried sword and wondered how I got through Nioh 1 LUL
[2:25:01] <+HuoShengdi> kurama sword dance also owns
[2:25:02] <+DatAsuna> Nioh 1's design ain't great but it was easier to find the exits
[2:25:02] <%hax_metatron> It’s a shame because the combat sings. I just hate finishing these games, just become a slog
[2:25:11] <+DatAsuna> @Profmcstevie As a big ninja gaiden fan: no
[2:25:24] <shiny_prinny> yeah fuck that item
[2:25:25] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> its dumb, dont bother
[2:25:27] <Profmcstevie> o-oh pattyYikes
[2:25:28] <oda_flobunaga> Nioh 2 has good level design by comparison
[2:25:33] <SirMcSlushy> Gravity has defeated a goblin this day
[2:25:33] <+MisdirectionErection> If you hold guard up you walk slower and it`s easier to walk on narrow paths
[2:25:43] <mr_catsup> I must be the only fucker in the universe to like the level design in this game lmao
[2:25:48] <%RealThiele> party path
[2:25:53] <%baka_sugoi> EW
[2:25:53] <%hax_metatron> They should have more restraint sometimes IMO. They just LOVE filling any available empty space with trash paths / useless shortcuts / enemy mobs
[2:26:07] <+DatAsuna> @oda_flobunaga Personally I hate that nioh 2 loops on itself so much more often because it leads to a lot more og getting lost in samey looking brown corridors
[2:26:14] <SirMcSlushy> Why was that bastard shooting at you and not the slime?
[2:26:15] <+gustavozxd> @mr_catsup that makes two of us if we also count the level design in 2
[2:26:21] <amiavamp> Don't forget every corner having something ready to jump at you. lol it's so common I just held block around every corner
[2:26:24] <SirMcSlushy> Dark Souls enemies workin' together and shitr
[2:26:35] <primaryfire> well each level tends to have a gimmick that rewards exploration by making something later easier
[2:26:45] <%HotSauceFiend> MY...only real gripe with this game is falling off ledges is VERY easy
[2:26:46] <%RealThiele> but what if you got item?
[2:26:50] <primaryfire> including this one
[2:26:57] <+DatAsuna> Even the duels in the wheat fields in this game manage to look washed out and flat
[2:27:00] <+Savarro> Nioh 1 loved putting enemies either around the corner or ESPECIALLY on the ceiling over items
[2:27:07] <+DatAsuna> when that shit should be peak kino
[2:27:08] <SirMcSlushy> So how ya feelin' bout the dual swords?
[2:27:08] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> the mojo is beginning to flow
[2:27:13] <+gustavozxd> my goblin in this game is to sheathe my sword EVERY SINGLE TIME after a fight
[2:27:24] <fruit_pie_the_magician> If you had sign or the cross you'd basically be flying swallowing through these dudes
[2:27:28] <Profmcstevie> That's not a goblin, that style
[2:27:34] <mr_catsup> @HotSauceFiend same like they should just not let you walk off of it that's too much
[2:27:37] <primaryfire> I remember parrying that skeleton on the roof and falling to my death because of the displacement of the parry animation
[2:27:38] <+Savarro> I never entered a room without aiming my bow at the ceiling above the entrance LUL
[2:27:41] <PwnyB> @HotSauceFiend Ye. Would be cool if they gave you the "Uh oh" animation that NPC's get just to give your heart a start and let you dodge back in but, eh.
[2:27:45] <%RayReborne> Yeah the Skeleton Vymens League Kappa
[2:27:52] <+DatAsuna> The best level design in any team ninja game is dead or alive: prove me wrong :P
[2:27:55] <Blank9> kicks op
[2:27:56] <@GeneralSCPatton> Almost botched that drop
[2:28:00] <Blank9> on any weapon that has them
[2:28:03] <mr_catsup> The y do but only when you're hit off of it
[2:28:04] <amiavamp> @PwnyB It does that in 2, funnily enough
[2:28:05] <theshillman> good find
[2:28:12] <mr_catsup> not when you just walk straight
[2:28:13] <vVAstrAVv> @hotsaucefiend if you never played 2 you cant fall off ledges in that if youre attacking without a direction imput or while blocking iirc. its great
[2:28:15] <+HuoShengdi> you do get the uh oh animation if someone hits you at an edge
[2:28:19] <+gustavozxd> hey! DOA has some pretty creative stages for a 3d fighting game
[2:28:22] <primaryfire> bar stays the same size doesn't it
[2:28:26] <PwnyB> @amiavamp Oh? xD It's been a while, maybe I've forgotten. lol
[2:28:30] <+DatAsuna> Yeah, that's why it's not worth minmaxing
[2:28:49] <Blank9> Pat, you can change the game display so that your health and ki has numbers below the bar.
[2:28:50] <+DatAsuna> @gustavozxd That's why it's the best yes
[2:28:53] <Profmcstevie> You know what? Yeah, Dead Or Alive DOES have some neat ass stages especially with it's destruction mechanic
[2:28:56] <+gustavozxd> @vVAstrAVv not sure about the blocking part, but yeah it's been like that since 1 and it helps A LOT with the first boss
[2:28:58] <Blank9> Gives a better idea of how hurt you are
[2:29:10] <+DatAsuna> Actually if you wanta real team ninja hot take
[2:29:12] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Best way to get good shit is basically to find revenant that are using the same weapon type as you
[2:29:12] <+gustavozxd> @vVAstrAVv sorry not first boss, the boss in this level
[2:29:12] <artoflec> i like this stage but its stressful
[2:29:14] <%RayReborne> shoot the core! barrel roll
[2:29:19] <vVAstrAVv> pat i beat nioh 2 with 9 con. just pump stamina lol
[2:29:20] <+dante_must_die_exe> oh pat, check the wall next to the door you just opened
[2:29:25] <+DatAsuna> Other M has shit story but I think it handled 2.5 environments well
[2:29:26] <%Axellogic> Poor Nurikabe forever missed
[2:29:29] <+DatAsuna> *2.5D
[2:29:41] <SirMcSlushy> Hitboxes
[2:29:44] <%RayReborne> core takes more damage thats all lol
[2:29:50] <+theomnisoup> hidden wall next to that door pat
[2:30:02] <amiavamp> The gunpowder bombs are good against the slimes
[2:30:03] <vVAstrAVv> @gustavozxd damn i didn't even notice it in 1. and i wasnt sure either hence the iirc lol
[2:30:07] <+DatAsuna> Dread sometimes moves the camera out of the side on perspective but it still feels like a weird flat video game level as opposed to a 3D space

[2:31:10] <@Lion_kun> try fire talisman
[2:31:16] <mr_catsup> you'd rather save them no?
[2:31:17] <SirMcSlushy> I think I used to firebomb em with ninja shit
[2:31:17] <primaryfire> the blobs tend to die in one firebomb too
[2:31:19] <didgereedoodah> save the talismans for the boss
[2:31:25] <+DatAsuna> It's more relevant for the boss than these guys
[2:31:27] <+gustavozxd> LUL
[2:31:37] <Profmcstevie> Good choice, fuck that
[2:31:38] <Pillagius> Pat have you noticed what happened on the last attack on that blob?

[2:31:59] <artoflec> this fight gives me heart palpitations
[2:32:08] <+DatAsuna> I do hate the yokai domain mechanic
[2:32:21] <+DatAsuna> purifying those is just annoying

[2:33:25] <SirMcSlushy> Yeah the weird thing about weapons in this game is you'd assume with all the options you'd wanna min max ya choices. But, leveling Familiarity aka swapping weapons with new ones after filling up the bar gives you skill points. Also, oof, big fall.

[2:33:47] <%HotSauceFiend> Ladder
[2:33:49] <amiavamp> There's a ladder around back isn't there?
[2:33:52] <+dante_must_die_exe> nah
[2:33:52] <+Mooseification> up the ladder on right
[2:33:52] <+boganis98> look up
[2:33:52] <%Axellogic> you ran away from the pillar thats forward
[2:33:53] <%Monkeyweed21> Its the Water Temple
[2:33:55] <PwnyB> Nah, there's a log you missed.
[2:33:55] <%Bane_Kaikyo> not dead end
[2:34:07] <agianttornado> Round the back
[2:34:17] <vVAstrAVv> this way
[2:34:18] <softbirby> God this game is a fucking mess from an audio stand-point.
[2:34:18] <theshillman> there is a onmyo magic that gives your weapon fire damage, very good for this boss
[2:34:20] <%Djinnazz> Lol
[2:34:30] <amiavamp> You got: 1x Salt
[2:34:31] <LunarRemix> It's not a Souls game
[2:34:38] <%HotSauceFiend> FINDING items is useless
[2:34:41] <%valriot> The biggest mistake is thinking this is a Souls game
[2:34:43] <Profmcstevie> It's an illusion that it's a souls game
[2:34:45] <%HotSauceFiend> Crafting Items can be useful
[2:34:47] <knight_verse> Are you even trying to find the Kodamas?
[2:34:49] <+athuramn> you just beasted that btw
[2:34:50] <RedKnightEmiya> @RedKnightEmiya is new here. Say hello! SeemsGood
[2:34:53] <%Axellogic> thats 2/3
[2:34:55] <%RayReborne> some of the items CAN be useful, but highly situational
[2:34:55] <vVAstrAVv> guys stip telling him about the boss hell figure it out
[2:34:56] <LunarRemix> It's more in-line with something like Let it Die grind-game than Souls
[2:34:56] <amiavamp> Sometimes it does reward you, though. There are samurai locks that are unique loot.
[2:34:56] <RedKnightEmiya> hi pat
[2:34:59] <SirMcSlushy> Very rarely are there like 'key items' you just pick up.
[2:35:03] <RedKnightEmiya> didnt you play nioh 2 already lol
[2:35:04] <a_mad_dragon_> BUT WHAT IF THE ITEM WAS GOOD
[2:35:06] <%hax_metatron> LUL the ultimate goblins
[2:35:08] <%Bane_Kaikyo> but you gotta do it cause some items r gud tho
[2:35:11] <+DatAsuna> yeah so much of the items are trash
[2:35:16] <%Monkeyweed21> this game is structurally less of a Souls game than even Sekiro
[2:35:19] <+Savarro> Hate this level, but the music is really good. So relaxing
[2:35:20] <%HotSauceFiend> Yeah yeah, Poison talismans on dual Swords was awesome
[2:35:28] <%valriot> This game is more like Diablo than anything else, it's just the combat is more akin to Souls, and some mechanics
[2:35:34] <Blank9> some consumables are pretty good, like sacred water
[2:35:37] <Profmcstevie> If you're concerned with what items are good in the sea of trash just fucking guide it, else ignore anything not easily acquired
[2:35:41] <artoflec> goodbye skelly
[2:35:50] <PwnyB> I mean, yeah. The Lockes are worth and everything else that isn't a coating for my weapon I sell, essentially.
[2:35:55] <%RealThiele> Salt x4
[2:35:56] <%HotSauceFiend> you need 3 fire things
[2:35:57] <amiavamp> Sacred water is so good that you get passives to let you carry more
[2:35:57] <+gustavozxd> they might not be REALLY useful but they're always useful to some degree
[2:36:07] <%RayReborne> hey its the way to go!
[2:36:16] <PwnyB> Sacred Water is pretty solid.
[2:36:17] <primaryfire> unfortunately an unknown item can never be as attractive as something in souls because it's either a consumable or gear you'll find a million copies of
[2:36:21] <+gustavozxd> salt for example is an amazing item
[2:36:29] <%HotSauceFiend> Look for the last Fire pedestal pat.
[2:36:40] <Cosairen> god kodamas are cute lil fellas
[2:36:42] <Profmcstevie> Welcome to the clan little green
[2:36:43] <@GeneralSCPatton> @primaryfire OR A UNIQUE SKILL POINT ITEM

[2:37:53] <+bluestbee> UMIBOZU
[2:37:54] <sirrice77> I remember farming this boss for armor sets
[2:37:56] <@GeneralSCPatton> Torches make boss easier I think
[2:37:57] <+secretspud> FUCK THIS BOSS
[2:38:03] <Darky04> fuck this boss
[2:38:04] <+secretspud> FUCK THIS BOSS TO HELL
[2:38:04] <%Paperware> torch just makes it a little easier, two should be enough
[2:38:04] <+bluestbee> It's one of the Thriller Bark guys
[2:38:04] <theshillman> UMI-DAH!
[2:38:06] <+Savarro> You can go in here without lighting any torches I believe
[2:38:08] <Blank9> you could do the boss with 0 torches
[2:38:09] <srv4254> hes gonna end the stream this is bed or chaos shit
[2:38:09] <+Local16> This boss sucks but fighting it with the items makes it cake
[2:38:10] <%RealThiele> time for resistance
[2:38:14] <mr_catsup> NOT if you light them all
[2:38:14] <PwnyB> Yes.
[2:38:14] <Cosairen> yes :)
[2:38:16] <+dante_must_die_exe> it's time for THAT boss LUL
[2:38:17] <AlwaysReturningVideotapes> oh he's fucked
[2:38:19] <theshillman> yes
[2:38:19] <+KiwiRedgrave> not if you have all three torches lit
[2:38:20] <amiavamp> It spawns 1 per torch unlit
[2:38:22] <ExpressNode> Whoa that think took half your health
[2:38:23] <mr_saturday93> I hope pat figures out the gimmick for this fight
[2:38:24] <+DatAsuna> yeah, torches slimit it
[2:38:26] <mr_catsup> they die on spawn
[2:38:26] <theshillman> light all the torches to stop the adds
[2:38:30] <+Savarro> I think I did it with zero torches and it was AWFUL
[2:38:31] <Profmcstevie> Killing them quickly with fire is the way to go
[2:38:31] <+boganis98> learning time
[2:38:34] <Darky04> GG
[2:38:35] <primaryfire> the sconces burn them before they reach the stage if they're lit
[2:38:36] <Profmcstevie> or light torches
[2:38:39] <%HotSauceFiend> So in this fight, Elemental Talismans Help clear the slimes FASTER
[2:38:40] <%Agami23> oh right, this fight!
[2:38:41] <%MooseIsGoose> If al torch lit no adds
[2:38:45] <+athuramn> ITS OKAY
[2:38:45] <%Axellogic> Lighting all torches prevents the adds from spawning
[2:38:46] <PwnyB> Kill it with Fire. :>
[2:38:48] <%Agami23> magic made this fight abit easier
[2:38:49] <mr_saturday93> Pat you need a fire talimans

[2:39:10] <mr_saturday93> Welcome to this fucking place
[2:39:11] <rReizs> CCCOMBO DEATH

[2:39:22] <vnzuelandude> All Torches = No Adds
[2:39:23] <%couch_potato_Ed_Boy> couch_potato_Ed_Boy subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 23 months, currently on a 20 month streak! Excellent! SeemsGood
[2:39:25] <%Paperware> VERY GOOD
[2:39:28] <@GeneralSCPatton> I kept seeing you take that corner too tight and correct away from death at the last second
[2:39:31] <Profmcstevie> The stress is leaving, the fury builds....excellent
[2:39:34] <+Savarro> Well now you don't need to worry about dying finding that other torch
[2:39:37] <%Djinnazz> Pfff
[2:39:37] <%HotSauceFiend> I may not be remembering right, but is this the worst level for ledges in Nioh?
[2:40:06] <%Axellogic> @HotSauceFiend certainly the darkest
[2:40:06] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.

[2:40:22] <+gustavozxd> oh hey one of those guys
[2:40:23] <%RayReborne> oh, two holes on wall is a secret wall demon
[2:40:23] <klx5> you just passed a fake wall
[2:40:23] <%Broand> behind you
[2:40:26] <%Axellogic> Theres a wall friend
[2:40:29] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt Turn around, NURIKABE
[2:40:30] <%HotSauceFiend> How do you get to the HIDDEN pathway i wonder
[2:40:32] <+gustavozxd> this level is a bit of a maze
[2:40:33] <+theomnisoup> 00
[2:40:33] <srv4254> WALL
[2:40:45] <PwnyB> ITS IN THIS GAME!?
[2:40:53] <mr_catsup> I actually think nioh 1 doesn't have that many ledges, this is basically it for the most part I found them to be more common in 2
[2:40:56] <PwnyB> I thought that animation save was just in 2 xD
[2:41:00] <Profmcstevie> Get gooped
[2:41:00] <vVAstrAVv> WALL
[2:41:06] <%HotSauceFiend> Look for EYES
[2:41:08] <%RayReborne> two holes on wall, big enemy
[2:41:11] <@Ranryu692> and feel the wind blow
[2:41:13] <+CookieCutter007> !uptime
[2:41:14] <@Moobot> @CookieCutter007 I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 41m.
[2:41:15] <%Axellogic> Wall friend with eyes to get to torch
[2:41:18] <+theomnisoup> the wall with 0 0 on it
[2:41:19] <didgereedoodah> look for eyes
[2:41:34] <%tanarath> Totally is
[2:41:36] <%transporterthesequel> SNAPSHOT KING
[2:41:36] <vnzuelandude> Pat save those for the boss
[2:41:46] <Profmcstevie> any damage is damage worthwhile against THAT boss, fer suuure
[2:41:51] <+TopTieramisu> you don't
[2:41:52] <%RayReborne> Smack
[2:41:53] <Darky04> kill
[2:41:54] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> check the graves
[2:41:54] <SirMcSlushy> Gamble
[2:41:54] <%HotSauceFiend> its random
[2:41:54] <PwnyB> Gwenyth Paltrow. Huge fan of this level.
[2:41:55] <@Lion_kun> red emote
[2:41:56] <+HuoShengdi> check for nearby bloodstains
[2:41:56] <+theomnisoup> guess
[2:41:57] <@Lion_kun> colour of eyes
[2:41:57] <klx5> guess
[2:41:57] <+pieking83> 2 out of three chance
[2:41:58] <%RayReborne> big hit
[2:41:58] <amiavamp> You can check revenants near the wall
[2:41:58] <oda_flobunaga> Bow
[2:41:58] <SirMcSlushy> Color-based
[2:41:59] <%Broand> Eyes
[2:42:00] <shiny_prinny> you have to guess, blue yellow or red
[2:42:00] <%Axellogic> Sometimes a revenant nearby gets killed with the wrong one
[2:42:00] <+boganis98> its a 50/50
[2:42:00] <%HotSauceFiend> either red or yellow or blue
[2:42:01] <+HuoShengdi> may give you a clue
[2:42:01] <%valriot> Check the bodies
[2:42:02] <@GeneralSCPatton> Check Revanant for one wrong category
[2:42:03] <mr_catsup> bow
[2:42:04] <vVAstrAVv> illusory wall ahead
[2:42:04] <+secretspud> check graves for cluyes
[2:42:05] <%RayReborne> NO SMACK HIM
[2:42:08] <aeonicVector> sometimes the bloodstains have a tip
[2:42:09] <srv4254> blue or yellow
[2:42:10] <mr_catsup> bow almot always works
[2:42:11] <+pieking83> or someone else dies letting you know which one not to use
[2:42:12] <%transporterthesequel> Color coding is the key
[2:42:15] <%RayReborne> Its an enemy Pat
[2:42:17] <%Broand> Look at the eyes
[2:42:17] <+secretspud> check all of the graves
[2:42:20] <SirMcSlushy> Sometimes graves do give ya hints if they died to it
[2:42:22] <SunsetJack> Check graves, usually it tells you which emotes NOT to do.
[2:42:22] <%greasypete00> smack him
[2:42:22] <primaryfire> you mostly just guess. it's based on the colour of the emote
[2:42:23] <mr_catsup> bow
[2:42:23] <didgereedoodah> sometimes they do
[2:42:24] <+HuoShengdi> rip, they all drowned
[2:42:25] <$Futurecity10> @PatStaresAt Blue red or yellow pick
[2:42:25] <%couch_potato_Ed_Boy> @PatStaresAt Fire elemental damage is your friend against the giant water blob monster boss and the smaller versions of itself.
[2:42:26] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> if the Nurikabe killed them, it will have a hint
[2:42:27] <%Axellogic> You get two guesses by color
[2:42:27] <srv4254> emote
[2:42:27] <%valriot> Its basically just Red, Blue, Yellow
[2:42:29] <%HotSauceFiend> oh the grave might say if they died due to "Benevolent or cautious actions
[2:42:30] <%Piemono> Lol they all drowned cause the wall pushed them off
[2:42:31] <rReizs> those idiots fell
[2:42:31] <@Lion_kun> red
[2:42:32] <%transporterthesequel> He HATE IT
[2:42:33] <+TopTieramisu> LUL
[2:42:34] <@Lion_kun> it's red
[2:42:34] <theshillman> sometimes there will be a grave that says like "Died from being rude"
[2:42:38] <shiny_prinny> guess it was yellow
[2:42:40] <@Lion_kun> Okay iw as wrong
[2:42:40] <vVAstrAVv> try gesture
[2:42:43] <+Savarro> He HATES it
[2:42:44] <Zombrocom> It was yellow
[2:42:45] <+pieking83> so its yellow if you die and have to try again
[2:42:48] <SunsetJack> Damn
[2:42:50] <SinisterBroccoli> eye color doesn't matter
[2:42:52] <@GeneralSCPatton> Damn, some graves say the cause of death is a type of behavior, color-coded to the feature type
[2:43:00] <Profmcstevie> Murder is better than puzzles
[2:43:06] <@GeneralSCPatton> *gesture type
[2:43:11] <%Axellogic> Wall friend slain
[2:43:14] <+gustavozxd> @GeneralSCPatton there was one he didn't check, maybe it was that one
[2:43:17] <BigYanno> jeez I go away for 2 minutes, come back and you're fighting a mario boss
[2:43:17] <%greasypete00> congrats
[2:43:20] <%RayReborne> wait the wall guys open for free if you use the right gesture??????
[2:43:21] <K1llingEdge> gg
[2:43:23] <%SWFanatic> Mmmmm Meee
[2:43:25] <%valriot> It'll either be Red, Blue or Yellow. That's all that matters, sometimes graves will have coloured text, and tell you the wrong colour
[2:43:31] <vVAstrAVv> its a specific gesture CATAGORY not a specific gesture. so blue red or yellow
[2:43:36] <+theomnisoup> yes @RayReborne
[2:43:39] <%RayReborne> gesture shit was only for mimics i thought????
[2:43:39] <artoflec> @RayReborne yup, usually a grave near them gives a hint to what they DONT like
[2:43:43] <Darky04> oof
[2:43:44] <%Broand> I'm like 90% sure it's the eye colour
[2:43:47] <+animalcrackersinmys0up> @animalcrackersinmys0up is new here. Say hello! HeyGuys
[2:43:48] <amiavamp> he spin and he win
[2:43:49] <%RayReborne> holy fuck
[2:43:50] <SirMcSlushy> dat half hp
[2:43:51] <%SWFanatic> Be free
[2:43:54] <%SWFanatic> You are free now
[2:43:56] <%HotSauceFiend> but you were at half health
[2:43:57] <gslayer14> mortis
[2:43:57] <%RayReborne> thats RAD
[2:44:02] <mr_catsup> you can whistle trigger the nutsacks too I think
[2:44:04] <%RayReborne> @artoflec thats RAD
[2:44:05] <Profmcstevie> Some tasty Nioh experience, melt in 2
[2:44:05] <vnzuelandude> @RayReborne Yes. There were supposed to be graves nearby that say "Died from being rude/neutral/nice"
[2:44:08] <rReizs> so he has no HP goblins anymore right
[2:44:23] <Profmcstevie> The hump is behind
[2:44:25] <%Broand> GOBLIN SLIGHTLY WOUNDED
[2:44:28] <SirMcSlushy> Cuz English-nese
[2:44:34] <%Axellogic> the wording does get better in 2 but they also add more shit
[2:44:34] <%valriot> It is in Nioh 2 LUL
[2:44:38] <Profmcstevie> infuriated is healthy, it's a critic of game design
[2:44:38] <artoflec> @mr_catsup yeah you bait them to peek out of chests if you whistle
[2:44:41] <@Lion_kun> So Nioh 2 then.
[2:44:43] <%RayReborne> yeah the wording needs to be imporved and an ACTUAL tutorial page covering everything
[2:44:44] <$ArcanumArcanum> There's always an NPC grave near a fake wall. That tells you what NOT to pick. So you have 2 chances to pick one of the other 2 colors
[2:44:47] <Fenlig> I hate the 5000 thousands weapons and armor
[2:44:54] <+Savarro> Once you get the wording and the general flow of upgrading gear it's not that bad
[2:45:05] <amiavamp> Nothing in this game is worse than the Demon Souls world tendency
[2:45:09] <theshillman> i guess the localization fucked it up
[2:45:10] <PwnyB> @ArcanumArcanum Not always. But Most times.
[2:45:10] <shiny_prinny> @ArcanumArcanum not always, but yeah that's the idea
[2:45:18] <%Axellogic> @ArcanumArcanum theres not always one
[2:45:20] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> It's better explained in Nioh 2. The only thing I looked up in Nioh 2 are the soft caps.
[2:45:24] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Once you have a halfway decent grasp of whats going on it's way more fun than it is now. Especially after this level
[2:45:24] <SirMcSlushy> Well, whats an example of what you're confused about Pat?
[2:45:25] <Profmcstevie> It'll come to you in time
[2:45:29] <rReizs> the game pat smacked his head against the optional first miniboss and then dropped
[2:45:30] <AoiRob> is it worse than tendency
[2:45:41] <+gustavozxd> I never tried to minmax this game super hard so I never had a problem with that
[2:45:52] <%HotSauceFiend> Its all tiny increases
[2:45:53] <Darky04> yeah
[2:45:54] <+DatAsuna> They all do very minor things
[2:45:57] <mr_catsup> KI
[2:45:57] <theshillman> you can still ki pulse while in living weapon
[2:46:03] <SirMcSlushy> The stats are mostly there for, what weapon do you wanna yopu.
[2:46:03] <+athuramn> they do, the increases are small
[2:46:04] <SirMcSlushy> use
[2:46:04] <mr_catsup> tHEART and BODY focus on these 2
[2:46:06] <%Axellogic> Your levels aren super important until you hit crazy high levels
[2:46:07] <%valriot> Your stats at this point are more about enabling armours
[2:46:09] <%Birdigalore> Put everything in luck
[2:46:09] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Also you can pop amrita items while living weapon is out to recharge it
[2:46:10] <+DatAsuna> They do small things so that quality builds don't fuck you as hard
[2:46:13] <+Local16> @PatStaresAt In both Nioh games you get a ton of levels so you'll be cranking your stat points way up
[2:46:13] <aeonicVector> Weapons can scale off several stats, so level what you need or your weaposn are good with
[2:46:13] <mr_catsup> everything scales with those
[2:46:13] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt because the weapons are low level themselves, the scaling does not do much
[2:46:14] <%SWFanatic> Invest in yourself
[2:46:14] <+athuramn> they look big over a 100 levels
[2:46:15] <%HotSauceFiend> so Body is Health, Stamina is Green, and level what it says effects your weapons
[2:46:15] <Xelhesia> lol
[2:46:16] <+TopTieramisu> :)
[2:46:19] <+HuoShengdi> they do something it's just very small until you hit huge levels
[2:46:20] <%valriot> LUL
[2:46:22] <AngryAsian5> LUL
[2:46:23] <didgereedoodah> it is a 100 tiny increases
[2:46:26] <SirMcSlushy> They do do a bunch of minor things, that can make differences, but its only really noticable if ya focus on it.
[2:46:26] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt stats are important for gear requirements generally
[2:46:27] <+ScrapKingKeita> he's just dancing
[2:46:28] <%HotSauceFiend> Speeen
[2:46:28] <Kain5707> yes :)
[2:46:28] <Darky04> LUL
[2:46:28] <Cosairen> SPEEN

[2:46:29] <Meta_Outhorii> he speeen
[2:46:29] <+wizard_of_diamonds> You spin me right around baby
[2:46:30] <BigYanno> He's just vibing
[2:46:32] <artoflec> he's just havin fun
[2:46:33] <Xelhesia> spin to win
[2:46:34] <Zahrtreiv> he's dancing leave him alone
[2:46:34] <mr_catsup> DEX and MAGIC are for those specific builds cause they let you crry more
[2:46:35] <%valriot> He spinnin
[2:46:35] <Profmcstevie> He seems fine
[2:46:37] <+secretspud> he do be vibe'n
[2:46:37] <+DatAsuna> and also because no caps, yeah
[2:46:38] <%Broand> I think his brain is missing an arrow
[2:46:39] <%Birdigalore> You spin me right round baby, rght round!
[2:46:40] <%greasypete00> lol
[2:46:40] <vnzuelandude> You'll get weapons with better stats as you go on
[2:46:43] <gslayer14> he's doin it
[2:46:46] <AzureFlame98> Hes living his best unlife
[2:46:48] <+Dudealy> Party Hard
[2:46:51] <%RayReborne> once NG+ starts then stats for scaling is important
[2:46:52] <+Risingxiv> They show you what your stats boost at the level up screen.
[2:46:58] <amiavamp> Round 2, Fight
[2:46:58] <+TopTieramisu> time for an annoying af boss
[2:46:59] <%valriot> Generally you'll only focus 3 main stats tbh
[2:47:00] <%raggedwharfrat> Are you big and strong yet, Pat?
[2:47:04] <Profmcstevie> They definitely could do with a second pass at this stat stuff.....a Nioh 2 or something
[2:47:09] <%Djinnazz> Ain’t about the stats, stats are just to use them, finding stronger gear is where number go up.
[2:47:10] <klx5> this is the last main mission in this region, don't worry about kodama at this point
[2:47:10] <%HotSauceFiend> technically you CAN beat this by not levelling excessively and focusing on dodges and technique
[2:47:15] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> after this mission, check the accessories that you got, one might have a Kodama Sensor
[2:47:15] <%RayReborne> Fire bombs, yum!
[2:47:15] <SirMcSlushy> I mean I played my first time through as a Dexterity Ninja, because of the cool Ninja Items which are free-reuse consumables of certain things, and the Kusari-gama.
[2:47:15] <+TopTieramisu> this boss is such a drag
[2:47:16] <%HotSauceFiend> WATCH out for LEDGE
[2:47:20] <+DatAsuna> It's all just small shifts, nothing will fuck you for not specking into it and mixmaxing will only give you a slight reward
[2:47:20] <%MooseIsGoose> Fire amulet
[2:47:24] <SinisterBroccoli> LIke I honestly enjoyed using a save editor to just get enough stats for every weapon and not have to worry about that
[2:47:25] <%Paperware> you're better off focusing on ninjutsu and magic to 30 early on
[2:47:27] <+Savarro> I never worried about any Stat other than body, heart, and my main weapon Stat until ng+
[2:47:28] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> @patstaresat Some of the stats soft caps early. I think Body's is at 10.

[2:47:50] <SirMcSlushy> And thats all ya really NEED to know. Everything else is bonus. Stat = Make weapon you want good, and after the fact you can see all the other things it does and work towards them when stats on their own lose their flavor.
[2:47:52] <+secretspud> This is the absolute worst fucking level and boss
[2:47:53] <Darky04> yeah. this boss is ass

[2:48:07] <%RayReborne> yeah the arena is one of the worst in any game

[2:48:10] <LunarRemix> Are you enjoying yourself Pat? It looks like you're not
[2:48:10] <klx5> you should switch back to the shrine that was closer to him
[2:48:10] <%HotSauceFiend> @vVAstrAVv he';s also not using fire weapsons

[2:48:29] <%Broand> yeah it was kind of emotional not gonna lie
[2:48:32] <+TopTieramisu> umibouzu is a shit boss
[2:48:33] <+Local16> You did have a couple moments there
[2:48:35] <+bluestbee> With the holes in the floor
[2:48:35] <%RayReborne> like i was worried man
[2:48:40] <SirMcSlushy> It IS quite obtuse, i'll certainly give you that.
[2:48:43] <primaryfire> remarkable
[2:48:44] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Ninjutsu is ALWAYS OP, it allows you to slow enemies down like 70 percent
[2:48:46] <amiavamp> This game is made for crazy people
[2:48:49] <Boya1995> Umi-bozu is considdeed such a bad boss that 2 had a boss that felt like a straight up appology for how much they messed up this fight
[2:48:54] <%Axellogic> IF you are going to run though the center it might be faster to use the previous shrine
[2:48:54] <jetstreamlove_R> This level just wants you to fall of
[2:49:01] <SirMcSlushy> Glad ya enjoying it tho.
[2:49:10] <knight_verse> The little big man wants to cry.
[2:49:13] <Profmcstevie> It's better as a game that Team Ninja do well, just action
[2:49:26] <BigYanno> OK so the runback isn't too long at least
[2:49:28] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt so its the shitting your pants of video games?
[2:49:31] <+DatAsuna> NGL, you did have a voice quiver there that reminded me of my dad when I teach him how to use the website for teacher stuff.
[2:49:34] <%valriot> Honestly they don't add anything else until endgame, and even then they take away need to worry about other stuff
[2:49:34] <%HotSauceFiend> This boss is famous for messed up ledges
[2:49:34] <%JoshManVGH> Did you play Final Fantasy Origins: Stranger in Paradise? That game is LOADED with tutorial already, it's GREAT!
[2:49:38] <SirMcSlushy> Put it this way, if you like the idea of what a specific thing like say toughness does, then you find gear for it and see if its worth building for it.
[2:49:41] <sennoh> you get used to it, just like what happens when people play souls the first time
[2:49:42] <%HotSauceFiend> YES
[2:49:43] <fruit_pie_the_magician> @PatStaresAt  Once you find a groove in this game you can just stay in it until you find a new groove
[2:49:45] <+Undenizen> you know, when i joined the stream i asked if this was a good game. an hour later, I'm still not sure.
[2:49:46] <%Axellogic> That consume the bonfire though
[2:49:49] <primaryfire> in nioh 2 they luckily auto-return your spirit when you enter the boss room
[2:49:49] <+DatAsuna> free fire
[2:49:51] <%RayReborne> yeah holy shit wow
[2:49:53] <SaltyAzteca> Boss HATES fire
[2:49:54] <%couch_potato_Ed_Boy> WAIT WHAT?!
[2:49:56] <Profmcstevie> FREE FIRE
[2:50:00] <PwnyB> You can cry in front of me. But use some fire amulets on your weapons. It's literally what the level teaches you to do, bub. :>
[2:50:02] <%afronooch> I was told early on that "Stats dont matter much do worry too uch about them", but that advice is 1000% useless for you
[2:50:03] <SirMcSlushy> Endurance Test
[2:50:03] <%RayReborne> shoot the core, Fox!
[2:50:05] <Profmcstevie> HEAT ME UP
[2:50:10] <PwnyB> Oh! He did! :D
[2:50:12] <BigYanno> OK now you're actually doing damage
[2:50:12] <%valriot> Pat you can hit it where it is now
[2:50:16] <+HellCopter> Big damage
[2:50:18] <+DatAsuna> Does he have any ogosho masks?
[2:50:19] <BigYanno> I am less concerned
[2:50:20] <srv4254> hes learning
[2:50:21] <%greasypete00> you can get good weapons from the enemy bloodstain summons
[2:50:23] <@Lion_kun> The nice thing about Nioh 2 is that your spirit animal automatically returns to you when you enter the boss room.
[2:50:25] <+KiwiRedgrave> ironically, the big WATER boss is weak to fire
[2:50:26] <+bluestbee> If this game had way tuned down damage numbers I think I would like it a lot more, like just as a pure action game instead of trying to inject difficulty by making enemies do crazy numbers
[2:50:33] <%Aleate> The Pat-brain is expanding. He is beginning to believe
[2:50:35] <+taa672> I absolutely adore nioh 2, put so many hours into it, but I never really got into nioh 1 as much
[2:50:39] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> you can get up the edge and hit his belly
[2:50:41] <+DatAsuna> *Hyottoko Mask
[2:50:42] <%HotSauceFiend> you CAN go closer to hit it
[2:50:42] <knight_verse> You can do it Pat. Kappa
[2:50:45] <%HotSauceFiend> no need to wait for arm
[2:50:46] <jetstreamlove_R> A literal "Should have brought your range weapon" boss
[2:50:47] <Run44forrest> Is there a way to turn the numbers off?
[2:50:53] <Profmcstevie> nah, this is working juuust fine
[2:50:53] <artoflec> @bluestbee you can just turn them off too and treat it like an action game
[2:50:58] <+Kaiserzelcor> I think shortly after I beat this guy I stopped playing.
[2:50:58] <primaryfire> I didn't know you could infuse your weapon at the fires lmao
[2:51:01] <jetstreamlove_R> The freaking blob from The Blob!
[2:51:03] <+Savarro> @lion_kun when I realized that was happening I was like "WHY WAS THIS NOT ALWAYS A THING"
[2:51:04] <+TopTieramisu> LUL
[2:51:04] <SaltyAzteca> think the settings you can

[2:51:12] <+dante_must_die_exe> AHHH
[2:51:12] <Kain5707> oof
[2:51:12] <SaltyAzteca> Thats the OHKO laser
[2:51:14] <amiavamp> @bluestbee absolutely, the game is at its best in the dojo 1v1 bosses where both you and the boss have a lot of health
[2:51:14] <+TopTieramisu> hyperbeamed
[2:51:14] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Can't you just go up and swing at it if you are careful and have reach?
[2:51:15] <PwnyB> MASEKO!
[2:51:17] <+TaurusOxford> oof
[2:51:17] <+gustavozxd> you were doing pretty well
[2:51:20] <@Lion_kun> Ah yeah, that's an instant kill.

[2:51:24] <shiny_prinny> no

[2:51:26] <%Bane_Kaikyo> NO
[2:51:26] <primaryfire> no they're set
[2:51:27] <@Lion_kun> Do you have fire charms.
[2:51:27] <%Broand> Nope!
[2:51:27] <SaltyAzteca> no
[2:51:27] <valerios_> nah
[2:51:29] <NemokillerV> nope
[2:51:29] <%MugenSandan> no
[2:51:29] <@Lion_kun> No
[2:51:29] <oda_flobunaga> No
[2:51:29] <%valriot> I'm firin my lazaaar LUL
[2:51:33] <%greasypete00> no
[2:51:34] <Profmcstevie> Nah it's fine
[2:51:35] <RushUnplugged> no it's gonna be on
[2:51:35] <TheMadBadger> Nope
[2:51:35] <%HotSauceFiend> torches are like consumables in the fight
[2:51:35] <K1llingEdge> they stay lit
[2:51:36] <oda_flobunaga> NO
[2:51:36] <artoflec> no, torches and stage mechanics like that are always permanent
[2:51:37] <%Paperware> no
[2:51:37] <jetstreamlove_R> It say no
[2:51:37] <+athuramn> freed from this mortal coil
[2:51:38] <El_Rabbit> If you have fire magic, you can do it
[2:51:38] <+DatAsuna> @bluestbee Honestly that was my big problem with souls too, hitting NG+ and their idea of challenge was just having enemies oneshot me
[2:51:38] <mr_saturday93> no
[2:51:40] <gslayer14> nah
[2:51:43] <mr_catsup> btw there's a magic that lets you summon the doggo
[2:51:44] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Super good for like third try, fire weapons push his shit in
[2:51:45] <@Lion_kun> If you have fire charms, you can imbue your weapon with fire.
[2:51:46] <gamezerox> Hyper beam goes for a ko
[2:51:48] <%HotSauceFiend> Yeah this boss is a shit
[2:51:49] <Frostydough1> D: Forever?
[2:51:49] <Boya1995> if it makes you fell better, this is the boss that got a apollogy fight in 2
[2:51:50] <mr_catsup> as an attack
[2:51:50] <PwnyB> Fair. xD
[2:51:52] <%Aleate> Pat shall return to the cocoon
[2:51:52] <%SWFanatic> A way?
[2:51:53] <jetstreamlove_R> Bring back Fire mah Lazar meme
[2:51:54] <valerios_> to a farm in upstate ny?
[2:51:55] <primaryfire> you need a vacation after this
[2:51:55] <oda_flobunaga> Sounds about right
[2:51:56] <%greasypete00> that's fair
[2:51:57] <SirMcSlushy> Breaks are always good for games like this.
[2:51:58] <+DatAsuna> taking a break after umi boxu sounds smart
[2:51:59] <%RayReborne> Water charms will reduce water damage if you picked up any
[2:51:59] <Profmcstevie> how far away
[2:52:02] <SpookyMooks> you did good today
[2:52:02] <+TaurusOxford> Pat go away?! NotLikeThis
[2:52:03] <@GeneralSCPatton> Yeah, Pat deserves a psaBig destress
[2:52:04] <%Djinnazz> F
[2:52:11] <%SirGO0SE> :)
[2:52:11] <%Djinnazz> No
[2:52:12] <%Aleate> tfuLove
[2:52:14] <BigYanno> he means he's going to go sit in the shower and have a little cry. Which is fine.
[2:52:15] <vVAstrAVv> no torch refresh
[2:52:18] <@Lion_kun> Umibozu sucks so bad they literally revamped him in 2.
[2:52:20] <%afronooch> he LIKES us
[2:52:22] <srv4254> goblins beat u
[2:52:26] <%MooseIsGoose> He spin
[2:52:27] <+TaurusOxford> LUL
[2:52:28] <%HotSauceFiend> because its Nioh. Nioh is understandably.... filled with goblins
[2:52:29] <PwnyB> That's friend.
[2:52:29] <%BinaryFireball> sounds like you're doing a lot better
[2:52:31] <+gustavozxd> the key to streaming is to always be miserable
[2:52:32] <%BinaryFireball> fucking dope
[2:52:33] <Profmcstevie> It's only funny when you aren't ACTUALLY about to shit
[2:52:33] <+Savarro> I was going to hit up XIV after this, but now I'm thinking it's Nioh 2 time
[2:52:34] <%RayReborne> when things are good, you dont need kindess Pat! Kappa
[2:52:38] <+ReallyBigRocks> I think a lot of us in here can relate in some way
[2:52:39] <+KngJester> PAT AND CHAT SITTING IN A TREE
[2:52:40] <RushUnplugged> absolutely the worst nioh1 level, and they knew
[2:52:40] <vVAstrAVv> gonna cry?
[2:52:40] <%valriot> that dude just vibing non stop
[2:52:41] <Profmcstevie> also Nioh is a shared pain for many
[2:52:42] <%SirGO0SE> we push you down when youre standing tall and pick you up when you fall :)
[2:52:42] <%greasypete00> <3 luv u pat
[2:52:43] <%Aleate> Oh wait- uh, you suck Pat Kappa
[2:52:45] <+DatAsuna> the cheese strat for umi bozu is fire shot/Hyottoko Mask
[2:52:48] <+Undenizen> it's called empathy, pat! at least, that's what I'm told
[2:52:48] <gslayer14> we can be shitters because we know you'll take it well
[2:52:51] <Kain5707> youre doing good to be honest
[2:52:53] <%SWFanatic> remember to breathe
[2:53:00] <%Axellogic> Keep in mind if you consume the bonfire the adds can spawn again
[2:53:01] <%Monkeyweed21> Pats about to shit his pants
[2:53:02] <%Bt_Robot> We know how much you love a Tsundere Pat, B-Baka
[2:53:03] <knight_verse> Gotta keep you down while you're up and pick you up when you're down.
[2:53:06] <jetstreamlove_R> Streamer fatigue?
[2:53:12] <+gustavozxd> @Savarro yeah... I'm kinda in mood to play because of this stream. Also I don't have ps plus so I can't play the beta atpCap
[2:53:13] <amiavamp> You can attack it while it's just sitting in blobby form
[2:53:14] <%valriot> You can go up to it and hit it from here btw
[2:53:15] <SirMcSlushy> Could always try shooting the big glowey boss bit.
[2:53:17] <+bluestbee> This is the biggest goblin so far I think maybe
[2:53:17] <%afronooch> cause this boss is afuck
[2:53:21] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt you can hit the body
[2:53:22] <vVAstrAVv> you can respec stats later
[2:53:25] <%Axellogic> Being close to him is actually way safer
[2:53:27] <BigYanno> safety strats
[2:53:28] <Profmcstevie> I'll stick to the arms thanks
[2:53:42] <Profmcstevie> The damage is EASILY high enough to be a pussy and go arms only
[2:53:47] <Admiral_PopnFresh> good damage
[2:53:48] <amiavamp> Only problem is sometimes the game puts a 1 pixel wide gap between the boss and the stage and you fall off while attacking
[2:54:06] <fruit_pie_the_magician> @PatStaresAt as long as you don't actually walk off the edge, you can go up to him and attack his main body, normal attacks won't carry you over
[2:54:18] <BigYanno> oh is this one of those 4 kings situations where he does way less damage if his arm hits you rather than his fist?
[2:54:21] <+TopTieramisu> pat's not picking up his bloodstain?
[2:54:24] <%RayReborne> tbh Pat can take like 10 points away from strength into Body, stamina and Heart and kick ass
[2:54:26] <%valriot> Just keep hitting him at the edge
[2:54:34] <rottingskeleton> Oh man I fuckin HATE this boss
[2:54:36] <jetstreamlove_R> The whole point of being a glass cannon is to be ballsy!
[2:54:37] <Profmcstevie> FLAME ON
[2:54:38] <theshillman> @TopTieramisu pat doesnt believe in living weapon
[2:54:40] <%afronooch> wait, ain't kato fire?
[2:54:40] <slipdog> all those stupid items come in pretty handy in fights like these
[2:54:43] <SirMcSlushy> There isn't much on it TIera :p
[2:54:54] <SirMcSlushy> But yeah he doesn't use them much
[2:54:55] <+TopTieramisu> @theshillman there also other passive benefits for having the guardian
[2:55:01] <@GeneralSCPatton> Was doing pretty well
[2:55:01] <+dante_must_die_exe> ohhhh
[2:55:02] <amiavamp> damage straight to the soul
[2:55:03] <SirMcSlushy> BIG LASER
[2:55:03] <+dante_must_die_exe> oh noo
[2:55:04] <sauceboss310> sugoiAwawa sugoiAwawa sugoiAwawa sugoiAwawa
[2:55:06] <sauceboss310> F
[2:55:06] <valerios_> word
[2:55:07] <rottingskeleton> Fuck this booooooossssss
[2:55:09] <@Lion_kun> the laser has a tell
[2:55:09] <%HotSauceFiend> I remember another gripe i had with the game was I had no idea how useful onmyo magic was until much later
[2:55:10] <+TaurusOxford> KAME HAME HAAAAAAAA!!!
[2:55:11] <theshillman> @TopTieramisu yeah but he doesnt know that
[2:55:12] <BigYanno> that beam came out fast
[2:55:12] <Profmcstevie> Yeah that shit is a LASER
[2:55:12] <+pieking83> he is a joke once you have fire masks
[2:55:13] <%Axellogic> ITs does alot of damage cause it also inflicts water damage
[2:55:15] <%MooseIsGoose> That really is a big one hit kill
[2:55:15] <vnzuelandude> try getting close and personal
[2:55:16] <@Lion_kun> but to be safe, always to the sides
[2:55:17] <Admiral_PopnFresh> this boss is an endurance challenge
[2:55:17] <gslayer14> get spirit back?
[2:55:18] <slipdog> this is Bed of Chaos
[2:55:19] <+gustavozxd> the grey smoke is the sign for the laser
[2:55:19] <PwnyB> Really should pick up your spiritboi. :>
[2:55:20] <+HellCopter> Isn't that a fire guardian? Going super saiyan with it would mean big damage
[2:55:22] <gamezerox> F
[2:55:22] <Frostydough1> whoa that one barley ahad any wind up , it was still recovering from the earlier animastion thats cheap @PatStaresAt
[2:55:24] <Profmcstevie> The telegraph is very mild
[2:55:25] <oda_flobunaga> They removed that move in 2
[2:55:25] <Boya1995> this is the worst boss in the game
[2:55:27] <RushUnplugged> if his body is low when he's charging, he's gonna do the BEAMU
[2:55:29] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> pay once you drop down go LEFT
[2:55:30] <jetstreamlove_R> Laser is really bs damn
[2:55:33] <rReizs> BIG YELLOW EYE instead of small yellow eyes
[2:55:34] <%RayReborne> its your souls too lol
[2:55:34] <+gustavozxd> guardian spirits give stats
[2:55:35] <+athuramn> you know you don't have to beat this thing. it sucks
[2:55:35] <+HellCopter> Spirit boy gives passive buffs
[2:55:38] <didgereedoodah> gotta look for the gross goo
[2:55:42] <BigYanno> cos he's sad and he misses you
[2:55:42] <%Axellogic> You dont have the passive stats if you arent wearing the spirit
[2:55:42] <@Lion_kun> Spirit animal is fire based.
[2:55:42] <+TopTieramisu> umibozu is trash
[2:55:44] <%Paperware> A quick change scroll makes this game so much more bearable for those types of moments
[2:55:44] <mr_catsup> you can summon doggo to melt the boss
[2:55:44] <+bluestbee> That literally deals like 5 times your current health what the actualk fuck
[2:55:45] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> 20% dmg reduction for starters
[2:55:47] <jetstreamlove_R> Bring on the cheese!!!
[2:55:47] <@Lion_kun> SO massive damage to the boss.
[2:55:49] <Profmcstevie> Having your spirit son gives passives
[2:55:51] <+Dudealy> This boss is like *shows hole*
[2:55:52] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I never used onmyo OR ninjutsu until I was trying to fight nobunaga and the ice chick at the same time
[2:55:52] <slipdog> is he on fatdodge?
[2:55:54] <+gustavozxd> the guardian spirit stats are essential
[2:55:55] <primaryfire> you take 20% more damage when you aren't holding your spirit
[2:55:58] <theshillman> spirit boy gives a nice and flat 20% damage reduction
[2:56:01] <%HotSauceFiend> you  opened up a closer checkpoint to the bossdoor anyway
[2:56:06] <vVAstrAVv> dont forget to pick up your spirit. it gives buffs
[2:56:09] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> youre welcome Pat
[2:56:11] <jetstreamlove_R> Get that cheesey cheese for that blob boss!
[2:56:15] <PwnyB> Also, while your in living weapon, it's a shield on your health bar.
[2:56:21] <%RayReborne> OH FUCK I FORGOT THOSE GIVE FIRE
[2:56:31] <%Broand> There's a really tricky way to deal with this dude. It's really poggers
[2:56:36] <%Axellogic> @bluestbee Because water doubles damage taken and its pure water so it inflict the element and does stupid damage it wasnt well balanced at the time
[2:56:38] <%studleydoorite> :I|
[2:56:42] <@GeneralSCPatton> Is he going for the slice and dice this time?
[2:56:43] <%RayReborne> clap clap clap
[2:56:50] <%RayReborne> psaUp psaUp

[2:56:58] <%valriot> LUL
[2:56:59] <+HellCopter> Watch for the black clouds around the eye
[2:56:59] <%SharkMissile> I hate this fucking boss
[2:56:59] <+gustavozxd> that was quick
[2:57:00] <BigYanno> i saw it coming that time
[2:57:01] <@GeneralSCPatton> WELL SHIT
[2:57:01] <%Axellogic> Whenever he glows with clouds he's going to use the laser
[2:57:02] <%HotSauceFiend> MOIST

[2:57:10] <Profmcstevie> Hydro Pump is a BITCH
[2:57:10] <slipdog> no he put his head down and opened his hole
[2:57:11] <klx5> when he's about to shoot the laser a black smoke effect appears around his mouth
[2:57:11] <@Lion_kun> There was a windup
[2:57:11] <%HotSauceFiend> it has a windup you warent recognizing it
[2:57:12] <+gustavozxd> it's fast
[2:57:12] <%Monkeyweed21> I saw it coming
[2:57:13] <valerios_> there's a little tell
[2:57:13] <jetstreamlove_R> heard you talking LUL
[2:57:14] <mr_catsup> mix upthe tell is the white balck
[2:57:14] <@Lion_kun> You missed it.
[2:57:15] <Admiral_PopnFresh> it has a wind up, it's just not super long
[2:57:16] <Reborn2killu> it does
[2:57:16] <%valriot> It does have a wind up
[2:57:16] <@GeneralSCPatton> The monochrome cloud effect
[2:57:16] <foxenco> Grey smoke is the wind up
[2:57:16] <+HellCopter> He glows with evilness
[2:57:16] <%greasypete00> it has like a second
[2:57:16] <amiavamp> It has 2 speeds
[2:57:18] <@Lion_kun> I could tell it was coming.
[2:57:22] <rReizs> the windup is the eye coalescing
[2:57:22] <Visorak6> That had windup
[2:57:23] <%MugenSandan> it does have a windup
[2:57:25] <fruit_pie_the_magician> When he goes from two eyes to one eye, he gonna beam
[2:57:25] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> There was, it's just very quick
[2:57:27] <+theomnisoup> any time he lowers his head and opens his face
[2:57:28] <%Bt_Robot> The boss's face is windup
[2:57:29] <@Lion_kun> Just stick to his sides.
[2:57:31] <%RayReborne> pick up doggo
[2:57:32] <SirMcSlushy> Ya was prob just lookin' at the wrong spot at the wrong time
[2:57:32] <rReizs> into BIG YELLOW eye
[2:57:33] <+Local16> @PatStaresAt The funky black and white smoke that shows its coming is really hard to see on this boss
[2:57:36] <RushUnplugged> @patstaresat the tell is that he's at ground level when he opens up
[2:57:40] <slipdog> one eye = bean
[2:57:41] <$PAPA_BUNGO> you can tell
[2:57:41] <@Lion_kun> He can't shoot anywhere except the center
[2:57:42] <%Monkeyweed21> the telegraph is not great
[2:57:42] <+gustavozxd> watching this fight right now is making me realize how "not that bad" this fight actually is
[2:57:43] <+TopTieramisu> LUL
[2:57:44] <oda_flobunaga> It has a wind up, it just has next to no tell, because it has no anatomy
[2:57:44] <jetstreamlove_R> the tell is just subtle

[2:58:15] <%couch_potato_Ed_Boy> RAW LEVEL 5 SUPER?!
[2:58:18] <Boya1995> this is 100% the bed of chaos of this game
[2:58:18] <Profmcstevie> Oh this bosses parents HATED him he's such a biiiitch
[2:58:19] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> now THAT is one of the things they fixed in Nioh 2, you automatically retrieve your souls when you return to a boss room
[2:58:19] <Run44forrest> drop your shield
[2:58:19] <+pieking83> Hyottoko Mask are the cheese strat
[2:58:20] <primaryfire> this game is sick
[2:58:21] <saddest_man> tiny particle affects around his face and also the big eyeball is the tell
[2:58:22] <@Lion_kun> That was some major bullshit.
[2:58:22] <@GeneralSCPatton> csbeastB csbeastE csbeastA csbeastT      csbeastA csbeastS csbeastS
[2:58:27] <rReizs> UMIBOZU: HEY IT WORKED THE LAST 2 TIMES, I'LL OPEN WITH IT THIS TIME
[2:58:27] <SirMcSlushy> Laughing is good
[2:58:31] <PwnyB> Please don't let that turn into a "I wont pick up dog now" goblin. xD
[2:58:31] <+bluestbee> Ohhh so this is why everyone is saying Nioh 2 is the good one lol
[2:58:34] <amiavamp> Shit like this is why Nioh 2 added picking up your souls instantly when walking into the boss fight
[2:58:37] <%MooseIsGoose> This game has no chill
[2:58:40] <valerios_> @pieking83 that item saved my ass on this boss LUL
[2:58:40] <%greasypete00> I think I remember that spears are good against him? not that it helps you much
[2:58:41] <jetstreamlove_R> Fair and Balance
[2:58:42] <slipdog> He's teaching you the tells pat he's a sport
[2:59:01] <Visorak6> Is the audio on this game crunchy or what
[2:59:05] <+pieking83> @valerios_ yeah on ng it shreds him so easily
[2:59:07] <dfs_k> he only has the 4 attacks
[2:59:18] <%SWFanatic> Its like a big squishy cactuar
[2:59:26] <+bluestbee> Also taking 20% less damage with your spirit doesn't mean she when the laser literallly does 3.5k damage I don't think
[2:59:28] <PwnyB> NICE
[2:59:30] <%HotSauceFiend> wait doesnt pat get boons from titles. Has he been claiming those ?
[2:59:35] <Profmcstevie> With consistency we can totally nail this
[2:59:36] <Admiral_PopnFresh> octoFinea I'm on fire
[2:59:46] <%RayReborne> yeyeyeyyeee
[2:59:59] <+TopTieramisu> LMAO
[2:59:59] <%Axellogic> Pat's not even to phase 2 yet
[3:00:00] <rottingskeleton> I think you need to call Woolie! lmao!!
[3:00:01] <@GeneralSCPatton> SHIT
[3:00:01] <+dante_must_die_exe> AAAHAA
[3:00:04] <%Broand> Oh its a combo
[3:00:04] <Profmcstevie> clean 40% gone
[3:00:04] <%valriot> SourPls the drums
[3:00:05] <+dante_must_die_exe> HAAA
[3:00:06] <brominefromspace> that is fast
[3:00:06] <SpookyMooks> I guess when his eyes go together expect laser
[3:00:07] <%RayReborne> that was it, the crouch
[3:00:09] <shiny_prinny> that was the fast version of the laser
[3:00:11] <SirMcSlushy> Ah, he keeps his big glowey butthole OPEN if hes gonna do the laser.
[3:00:12] <$PAPA_BUNGO> that was fucked lol
[3:00:13] <mr_catsup> if he stays open he gonna beam in the 2nd phase
[3:00:13] <amiavamp> Yep there's a version that has like no startup...
[3:00:14] <+HellCopter> Eyes on the prize
[3:00:15] <%Bt_Robot> See how he have a big eye?
[3:00:17] <%RayReborne> he crouches slightly, RUN
[3:00:18] <+gustavozxd> that was a different tell for the laser
[3:00:22] <@Ranryu692> the difficulty is Very Bad
[3:00:23] <jetstreamlove_R> he leans in a bit before firing the laser
[3:00:23] <mr_catsup> there's 3 phases
[3:00:24] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> Yeah, sometimes you just gotta leave the pools alone
[3:00:24] <+TopTieramisu> the laser is pure bullshit
[3:00:25] <%Broand> It canceled from water ball into laser
[3:00:25] <%HotSauceFiend> Pat check your menu for additional bonuses. Angyo or ungyo points i think
[3:00:30] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt the tell is the eyes combine into 1 and then lowers
[3:00:31] <@Lion_kun> Pat, if you can't see the tell, just stick to the sides of the arena.
[3:00:31] <mr_catsup> slow fast and you'll see
[3:00:34] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Honestly just get the tell for that move down and you got this
[3:00:34] <+DatAsuna> umi bozu is happening
[3:00:34] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt that was the tell by the way, what happened right before it merked you
[3:00:35] <Boya1995> the boss is badly desinged, not your fault
[3:00:40] <amiavamp> It woke up into super
[3:00:45] <Profmcstevie> It's a blob, what do you mean "crouch"
[3:00:47] <Admiral_PopnFresh> @PatStaresAt some times, after the boat belch, it fire a no-start up laser, so always expect a laser after boat belch
[3:00:48] <%RayReborne> Yeah THAT'S what got me before too, i remember now
[3:00:48] <rottingskeleton> he did a cancel that time
[3:00:50] <knight_verse> Worry about purifying for after it fi ishes its combos.
[3:00:52] <%greasypete00> this boss sucks and is definitely a wall for players to hit
[3:00:53] <PwnyB> This is wild for melee users. I went Onmyo Ninjutsu. xD
[3:00:53] <%tanarath> When he kinda half-bows with the eyes turned into a single one, that's his wind-up @patstaresat
[3:00:57] <BigYanno> Remember Pat it could be worse. It could be Bed of Chaos
[3:00:57] <SirMcSlushy> Seems like if he keeps his asshole open AFTER a water blast, hes gonna do the laser.
[3:00:59] <+gustavozxd> @Boya1995 there was a clear tell though
[3:01:02] <%XzileGaming> "you ever seen a blob crouch? pepperidge farm remembers"
[3:01:04] <+DatAsuna> fire shot is almost mandatory to beat this without spending ages waiting for a window
[3:01:08] <@Lion_kun> HE TRIED TO LASER HIM AGAIN
[3:01:15] <oda_flobunaga> 360 no scope dodge right there
[3:01:18] <SpookyMooks> this boss is so lame
[3:01:20] <rottingskeleton> brap
[3:01:24] <superdude22> Pat, get close
[3:01:34] <jetstreamlove_R> if it moves erratic most likely a laser
[3:01:34] <superdude22> You can only do damage in close range
[3:01:36] <%SWFanatic> Imma firin my lazerrrrr
[3:01:37] <%HotSauceFiend> remember you also hgave your spirit summon
[3:01:44] <+RayReborne> if the Eye is open as well
[3:01:48] <+AWanderingKenku> Just wait till the part with adds
[3:01:48] <PwnyB> I have never seen this guy laser so immediately after crossing the threshold into his domain before. lol
[3:01:50] <superdude22> HUG HIS BODY
[3:01:59] <rottingskeleton> save your spirit summon
[3:02:02] <amiavamp> There are good water bosses in action games like the Hydra in God of War and then there's this
[3:02:02] <Visorak6> The eyes push together instead of the between rupturing open it seems.
[3:02:05] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt its the whit and black fuzzy spark things
[3:02:07] <Profmcstevie> Do we have fire arrows or something
[3:02:15] <@GeneralSCPatton> YEYEYE, AVOIDED THAT BAIT
[3:02:20] <rottingskeleton> YOU MIGHT FALL IN IF YOU HUG HIM TOO MUCH
[3:02:27] <%RayReborne> @oda_flobunaga those didnt show up last attempt i saw
[3:02:30] <+DatAsuna> @Profmcstevie fire shot is your projectile fire spell and it trivialises the fight yeah
