[0:02:04] <+tomdwarf> so, the pokemans. Ive seen a good amount of gameplay, it doesnt look amazeballs, but they are clearly playing with the standard formula. If I still had my switch Id grab it.

[0:02:52] <%SuckerPunchSyd> @madinki theres a clip of twitter of a snorlax using hyper beam and its great

[0:03:17] <jmepik> has anyone in chat touched this game?
[0:03:19] <%NoHoldsBarredProductions> MonHun is old and busted. Pokeymans is the new hotness.

[0:03:37] <%The_Protagonist> honestly watching other people play this, it seems like the only Pokemon game worth spending the money on for a long time
[0:03:38] <Guardiansaiyan> I work 3 hours from now! .....yay.....
[0:03:43] <zombieKillaKlown> I’m playing it right now
[0:03:43] <%TeenyTelly> Games pretty fun in my opinion
[0:03:47] <%SuckerPunchSyd> I thought about getting it but I stopped buying pokemon after gen 7
[0:03:55] <jmepik> that's good to hear
[0:04:00] <Guardiansaiyan> imGlitch sound is....off...
[0:04:03] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Just sorta fell off of it but this looks interesting

Watching you with PoE event made me realize I've taken for granted the level of opaqueness in the game and then I remember I have to use a community program to do all the math for builds, a wiki, and a trade site all open at once while playing
[0:04:11] <%marvel877> I'm surprised Woolie doesnt get in on the current Pokemon hype while it lasts and fire up Pokken again.
[0:04:13] <%The_Protagonist> plus I can have two different Sneasels, which is my favorite, so I'm definitely biased lul
[0:04:15] <%NoHoldsBarredProductions> Since there are little furry creatures about, does that mean we can expect an appearance from one Mr. Plague of Gripes?
[0:04:15] <%baka_sugoi> @NoHoldsBarredProductions Only the OLDS play MonHun psaDab
[0:04:16] <cpt_langosta> pegasus
[0:04:35] <+ReiDuran> It's okay. It's not amazing or anything but it's fine enough
[0:04:36] <jmepik> the new sneasel looks amazing lmao
[0:04:38] <Guardiansaiyan> @NoHoldsBarredProductions we can only hope
[0:04:56] <%Mendin> @NoHoldsBarredProductions less little than you might think, so proibably
[0:04:56] <jmepik> some of the new forms are meh but sneasler or whatever is hilarious
[0:04:59] <+kimbosegg> long sneasel is creepy. weavile is my fav pokemon
[0:05:02] <%oda_flobunaga> IDK Pokemon has consistently disappointed me ever since Gen 2.  Never played past gen 5
[0:05:03] <%linkster291> @NoHoldsBarredProductions No but we might get to see professor Harkness.
[0:05:03] <%TeenyTelly> I wonder which starter he’ll go with
[0:05:09] <%angriestanthony> It's my birthday and have to go into an 8 hour shift right now.. thankfully I get to listen to Pat the whole time in the background!
[0:05:23] <Ombrebird> did I miss the start? are we in a mid break?
[0:05:28] <%SuckerPunchSyd> I miss mystery dungeon games tbh
[0:05:33] <jmepik> probably cyndaquil
[0:05:34] <jmepik> let's be real
[0:05:34] <%The_Protagonist> @jmepik what's funny is the new Sneasel itself is awesome and then Sneasler is so... looks like someone made a Sneasel-based Vtuber lol
[0:05:35] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Nope just starting @ombrebird

[0:10:54] <%pokefan9956> keep in mind it's the first day
[0:10:54] <Majin_Kuum> it's been the same thing for 25 years
[0:10:56] <cpt_langosta> so much pokefud
[0:10:56] <%YakumoYomi> It's not bad, to be quite honest.
[0:10:56] <+TreeeFOX> oh no no no no no no no
[0:10:57] <Treasure_Vault> But pokemon is bad???
[0:10:58] <%SaiyanShoto> It’s good, I’m glad that it’s different
[0:10:58] <DianaTheAscian> it's just okay
[0:10:58] <+lumporr> it's DIFFERENT!
[0:11:00] <+Zix_Serro> Lately. As in "the last ten years". Yeah.
[0:11:01] <Guardiansaiyan> VAPOREAN!
[0:11:01] <tanarath> How could this be?
[0:11:02] <Profmcstevie> Lately?
[0:11:03] <%ChillaxingJay> true
[0:11:03] <seer0ftime> it slaps real hard
[0:11:05] <+MelodyMedley> Was in the middle of watching the clemps vod for it
[0:11:07] <Guardiansaiyan> i guess
[0:11:07] <jmepik> only like, the last ten years
[0:11:07] <+pupil31> oh no no no LUL
[0:11:07] <Latija> apparently its good but it also looks like a bad mobile game
[0:11:10] <%ChillaxingJay> it
[0:11:11] <knight_verse> And you lead the pack. Kappa LUL
[0:11:14] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Why would you listen to people who bought it day one after the last one?
[0:11:17] <Shwepie> The changed to an initiative based turn system, and added strong and fast attacks. What is this madness?
[0:11:21] <%The_Protagonist> honestly the only bad thing I've seen about Arceus is the shadows kinda break but otherwise the finished thing seems solid. actual good animations for once.
[0:11:22] <+jingokrieg> Wheres the queen
[0:11:24] <%pokefan9956> I've heard it gets really stale after 15 hours
[0:11:24] <@DakotaMacDoodle> DakotaMacDoodle subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 31 months, currently on a 19 month streak! Hey Pat I tried out Path of Exile and wow that's a fun game with many many skills
[0:11:28] <Profmcstevie> Seems like an excessive amount of copium from some stockholm fans
[0:11:28] <ennui_on_me> People saying Pokemon's been trash forever as though Sun & Moon didn't kick ass
[0:11:28] <+polothegreatest> Pokeymans let me show them DxCat
[0:11:29] <%ChillaxingJay> it IS a bunch of bs
[0:11:29] <Treasure_Vault> Is it good? Or good for a pokemon game?
[0:11:32] <%Nekros4442> @latija so it looks like a pokemon game
[0:11:32] <ReiDuran> Slowly, begrudgingly, the dinosaur moves towards progress.
[0:11:32] <%ChrisPlaysThing> nice and bright, with those Dalmations
[0:11:35] <+lumporr> i missed seemingly the single opportunity to land an eevee in the starting area so look out for that
[0:11:38] <ReiRyghts1> as a person who has played every pokeman games they drastically dipped in quality when they went to 3d
[0:11:38] <DianaTheAscian> the new Pokemon is so just okay that people are thrilled to have something decent
[0:11:40] <%marvel877> New Pokemon Snap was fun. Know why? Because Game Freak didn't make it!
[0:11:42] <EynoStiles> i just want the cclassic games on my switch
[0:11:42] <Blank9> it's good in a "boy this is going to be good when it comes out of early access" way
[0:11:42] <cpt_langosta> bone-in meat
[0:11:42] <%Dakuu75> are there 100k pokemon yet?
[0:11:53] <neraren> It seems like its more a stealth game than a battle game to me, and not a very good one
[0:11:56] <%ClericOfSparda> ???
[0:11:58] <ReiDuran> Honestly the game's not bad or anything but it's not like. Amazing. It still has the gigantic extended pokemon tutorial
[0:12:00] <+lumporr> @ReiRyghts1 gale of darkness is goat
[0:12:01] <%Bailey__Gaming> @patstaresat do you have a favourite pokeyman? I forget if you ever stated it
[0:12:01] <%The_Protagonist> @Dakuu75 i mean there's like 1k

[0:12:35] <Guardiansaiyan> dang
[0:12:36] <%solracc25> yup
[0:12:37] <+polothegreatest> LUL LUL
[0:12:37] <%pokefan9956> Mario Galaxy absolutely looked better than this. this is like 2004
[0:12:38] <+jgalena> worse than oblivion
[0:12:38] <ennui_on_me> I just wish the games would be sprite-based again man
[0:12:38] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> 2008 is GENEROUS
[0:12:39] <%TheHateFish> Oblivion all up in here
[0:12:40] <%JobbedBone> I WANT TO GO THERE
[0:12:40] <%RaikOuija> It technically is?
[0:12:45] <%marvel877> More like 2002
[0:12:46] <Ghostduck01> LUL LUL
[0:12:46] <%waltzqueen> Mean AND true
[0:12:46] <Treasure_Vault> all pokemon can shrink, intrinsically
[0:12:48] <tanarath> Better than the graphics of 2003?
[0:12:49] <DianaTheAscian> not even 2008 more like 2003
[0:12:50] <Profmcstevie> "I died and went to a PS2 game?!" is a stellar Light Novel idea
[0:12:50] <+BigBruthaThunda> 08 is generous
[0:12:52] <wolfdogf> And it begins
[0:12:54] <+FingaLights> still progression for pokemon
[0:12:56] <Latija> oblivion looks better lol
[0:12:57] <DianaTheAscian> it's super ugly
[0:13:00] <%Bailey__Gaming> the switch does its best common
[0:13:00] <%baka_sugoi> Its BLAND
[0:13:01] <cpt_langosta> it looks like pokeman
[0:13:02] <%ChillaxingJay> Lmao LUL
[0:13:04] <+lumporr> it looks cool because of new camera stuff
[0:13:07] <%Valdorick> If you think the game looks worse than 2008, get your eyes checked. Its bad, its not 2008 bad.
[0:13:08] <+lumporr> you can run around in da battle
[0:13:09] <Blank9> it looks like it's in early access
[0:13:09] <DKDiamantes> Super hideous
[0:13:10] <%BallerSwagBro9k> I'll take fun game over pretty game every time
[0:13:10] <%The_Protagonist> i wouldn't say hideous, it's really the lighting engine that sucks
[0:13:11] <%YakumoYomi> I wouldn't say "hideous", but there's so reeeeeal bad pop-in
[0:13:13] <%brisk_dacat> Hey early 00’s graphics were… acceptable
[0:13:14] <HaroldDonchee> pokemon games never looked amazing, but this is embarassing
[0:13:14] <%CopperTucker> CopperTucker subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 30 months! You've been stuck with me for 30 months haha lame. But for real, I'm happy to keep supporting you and the chaos you live in. Also please give your energy to my sister, LadyQuixote, as her cat Jaxy has been put in hospice care :(
[0:13:16] <bigshedman> @Profmcstevie Oh no I'm in Silent Hill LUL
[0:13:16] <%Soliloquy123> It has SOME pretty locations
[0:13:17] <ennui_on_me> shorter games with worse graphics etc. etc.
[0:13:19] <%MegadBlitz> I think hideous is a bit of a hyperbole
[0:13:20] <artoflec> they couldnt even model a FLUTE
[0:13:21] <%oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt Hello, are you a boy or a girl?
[0:13:25] <+chiazam> A good Pokémon game in 2022? Really?
[0:13:29] <tentavision> oh no not that one
[0:13:29] <%oda_flobunaga> Yep
[0:13:32] <%solracc25> It's nor BotW, but it is not ugly
[0:13:33] <%TheHateFish> Wait. Weird story? Out of nowhere protagonist? Very different story? Is... is this Pokémon: Morrowind?
[0:13:36] <+Scevda> That premise sounds like a ripe opportunity for modders.
[0:13:39] <+polothegreatest> PKM company needs an update of hardware doodBait
[0:13:40] <%Soliloquy123> worth noting Oblivion has some dogshit-looking locations lmao
[0:13:42] <+TopTieramisu> game freak is a small indie company. give them slack :)
[0:13:44] <BioStormX> It plays good in 4k on emu, and there's even a mod to make draw distance better
[0:13:45] <Blank9> even more unfair is smt5
[0:13:46] <%RaikOuija> Won’t somebody think of the indie studio known as “gamefreak”?  Kappa
[0:13:51] <WaxWitch> yikes
[0:13:56] <%ShinobiPhoenix> people really badly need to stop with pretty much all graphics talk
[0:13:56] <ComradeConquistador> Literally looks like a Gamecube game.
[0:13:58] <cpt_langosta> speedtree did some work
[0:13:59] <knight_verse> At this point I don't trust anyone that talks about graphics, it's like people don't actually remember how old games used to look due to being used to upscaling them with god like PCs and mods.
[0:14:02] <%MidnightBurst12> oblivion knew how to hide its ugly
[0:14:03] <%oda_flobunaga> A screenshot with NPCs in it even
[0:14:03] <OldManDeckardCain> morrowind with mods looks better than skyrim
[0:14:04] <%SaiyanShoto> It doesn’t look incredible but I think it looks better than the trailers
[0:14:05] <+lumporr> world looks bad. pokemon fights look near the best i think they've probably looked
[0:14:08] <%Saadi90> It’s weird because Skyrim looks good on Switch
[0:14:09] <%JobbedBone> oblivion is ugly but it gives good head
[0:14:11] <larrythecuck> you're welcome
[0:14:11] <linSP> Oblivion is... kinda ugly...
[0:14:13] <%marvel877> Its not even a Switch problem, its Game Freak problem.

[0:14:22] <Guardiansaiyan> @PatStaresAt starting to recognize you again cause of beard growth
[0:14:25] <%ShinobiPhoenix> the gameplay of every single game is more important and every single bad game is overhyped if they are "pretty:"

[0:38:07] <HotMafia81> Those shits are expensive
[0:38:08] <jmepik> i had volunteer firefighter training a few days ago and they told us if you get injured in your house on the way to an emergency, we need to make sure to crawl out the front door or the city won't cover the medical bill in its entirety
[0:38:08] <nukle0nik> you have forklifts driving around, so you need steel toed boots
[0:38:13] <Ombrebird> does Canada have osha
[0:38:13] <%solracc25> work hazzard
[0:38:13] <$DocMadfox> Pat, this is America. You don't get Comp unless that foot is fucking gone. Even then you're gonna fight.

[0:51:40] <%Frodiddly> come back soon preg and zangief
[0:51:50] <LittleBlueWraith> @BubbaRands why do you think he has to go out so often? nowhere to store it
[0:51:51] <Togamdiron> @BubbaRands That's why he needs to go so often, he has no place to store the pee.

[0:52:42] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> I just got here, what I miss?
[0:52:44] <%ShinobiPhoenix> it's obvious because the game expects you to get the OTHER two starters
[0:53:05] <%SveriSageAdvice> @Fetrigon its way more obvious when the child who knows they have ADHD and got diagnosed with it and dealt with it for 26 years kinda just looks at their dad like "YOU"
[0:53:05] <EynoStiles> @lerouch_the_rebel Pee break and spousal abuse the usual
[0:53:20] <%ShinobiPhoenix> you can't complete the Pokedex without trading unless they are hidden in parts of the endgame

[1:16:51] <$Pompadourius> Why the fuck is Arceus talking like Urianger
[1:16:52] <%missingangle> I got a text from God. It says "pog." I blocked God
[1:16:52] <%darklordfodder> Arceus is just the Greay Deku Tree

[1:16:56] <lol_red_ranger> I do not believe in the god phone
[1:16:57] <%cade_calrayn> it's the power of god WITHIN an anime
[1:16:57] <ReiDuran> Imagine leaving God on read.

[1:17:02] <cartakus> "Thee are cringe"
[1:17:03] <%marvel877> "God Friended Me" was literally a TV series.
[1:17:03] <%MechArch> pokemans crusaders
[1:17:03] <@Ranryu692> I saw someone earlier saying whoever thought this game was ugly needs their eyes checked and just... bruh psaLol

[1:17:27] <ShadeTheNovice> D:
[1:17:28] <adamant1333> its monster hunter
[1:17:29] <$Pompadourius> LUL
[1:17:29] <%cooldude69xx> This game tells you how they catch the first pokemon I think
[1:17:30] <+tempestzephyr> and so Jesus blessed his people with the power of 5G
[1:17:30] <%RayReborne> Apricots apparently, from Gen 2 lore
[1:17:30] <%cade_calrayn> DO NOT HURT THE ROUND BOI
[1:17:30] <%sonuke_draws> throw a pokeball at it
[1:17:31] <nzrai> god wouldn't want that...
[1:17:31] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt they used to make deals with psychic ones iirc
[1:17:32] <gslayer14> throw a rock
[1:17:32] <%Logoth_> Sometimes if you throw a pokeball you can catch things without damaging
[1:17:33] <%YakumoYomi> @Pompadourius Have you ever seen Urianger and Arceus in the same place?
[1:17:33] <+ReallyBigRocks> just huck balls yo
[1:17:34] <%LastHazzerd> Pokemon Conquest
[1:17:35] <%darklordfodder> No you just throw 100 balls at it
[1:17:36] <cartakus> Abuse for the win
[1:17:36] <jbrachob> they threw rocks and beat it with sticks
[1:17:36] <%sonuke_draws> endlessly
[1:17:37] <Treasure_Vault> Grab attacks
[1:17:38] <jmepik> they "pacified" and "domesticated" it
[1:17:39] <vingadivo> just trow the pokeball at a shitty loser pokemon
[1:17:40] <wqorst> dumb orb
[1:17:40] <+Pleblu> Set it on fire
[1:17:40] <TopTierHarley> They created poke balls
[1:17:40] <%ShinobiPhoenix> play the game like a rogue assassin
[1:17:40] <Paltheos> You can catch pokemon without weakening them first. It's just less likely.
[1:17:42] <ShadeTheNovice> they just throw the ball?
[1:17:42] <%RaikOuija> Tho ball
[1:17:42] <jmepik> with baton
[1:17:43] <%MyNameIsRasus> I really hope Pat streams Palworld
[1:17:43] <%sniffy77> PHOTOSYNTHESIS
[1:17:44] <Ombrebird> Acorns
[1:17:44] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> a true menace that one
[1:17:44] <+Exicuren> throw some chicken nuggets and the beat it to death
[1:17:46] <GeneralHysterics> cyndaquil tho
[1:17:47] <gslayer14> they didn't used to have balls
[1:17:47] <Paltheos> Rowlett *is* really cool.
[1:17:47] <$zyberion626> he is an orb
[1:17:48] <Lozovalazo1> So safari zone is recreational history?
[1:17:48] <$alex_streams_a_thing> Pokemon religious war
[1:17:48] <%karovus> you could definitely take that rowlett in a fight. cyndaquil howerever...
[1:17:49] <PlatinumWyvern> apparently pokemon have the ability to shrink down now, it's not even the ball that does it anymore
[1:17:49] <tangowulf> Turns out Pokemon just shrink naturally
[1:17:49] <senfood> BORB
[1:17:51] <%cvp5127> rat boy
[1:17:51] <Blank9> orb
[1:17:52] <%doc_ock_rokc> WATER POKEMON OR DEATH
[1:17:52] <%waltzqueen> psaOrb
[1:17:53] <%Hamborgini> surely any godphone would be 3G. You know, because of the trinity.
[1:17:54] <Madinki> This is the only game i can think of where God fucked around withy your phone
[1:17:55] <%VentWilsn> but its always flares up
[1:17:55] <%Anime_Flux> *sigh* No shit, game.
[1:17:56] <Dunmarkh> CYNDAQUIL IS PISSED
[1:17:57] <jbrachob> he is the best
[1:17:57] <+alternative_flu> Revolver Oshawoot
[1:17:58] <%JobbedBone> just imagine what they did to pokemon before they had pokeballs

[1:18:04] <@QueequegTheater> It's just like you
[1:18:04] <%MyNameIsRasus> Why do they still sound 8bit
[1:18:04] <Paltheos> Rowlett or Cynadquil are the clear choices here. Oshawott's awful
[1:18:07] <streamtouched> these are the first made pokeballs aren't they?
[1:18:07] <+Pleblu> He looks mad
[1:18:08] <%LastHazzerd> it might be a shell
[1:18:08] <vingadivo> Cyndaquil chads can't stop winning
[1:18:08] <cartakus> And if it goes out HE DIES
[1:18:09] <+bytex678> I really wish they'd stop using those fuckin 8-bit sound effects from the gameboy era
[1:18:09] <+chupabiscotti> Take cyndaquil you coward
[1:18:09] <%pokefan9956> oshawott is lit
[1:18:10] <%barrakuta371> I love cyndaquil
[1:18:10] <%darklordfodder> All of them are cool, though Piplup > Oshawott

[1:19:21] <$Pompadourius> THE BALL COMPRESSES THEM INTO LIGHT, THAT'S BUUUUULLSHIT
[1:19:24] <$PinkertonDanPie> with all respect, the professor looks like he would hit you if you tried to touch his hat.

[1:19:25] <Saltmeisterr> WHHHYYYY
[1:19:26] <+unhuggable1> .....

[1:19:26] <%cvp5127> thats stupid
[1:19:26] <+tnomads> they're not prisoners!
[1:19:26] <%Valdorick> The Pokeball forces it on them

[1:19:30] <%BallerSwagBro9k> THATS RIDICULOUS
[1:19:31] <ahaegotrigger> Yep
[1:19:31] <ToneBacas> they want to get hit
[1:19:31] <%OverzealousEuthanasiast> but...
[1:19:32] <%GuilKato> maybe hes not a good professor
[1:19:32] <Vashido22> DONT WORRY ABOUT IT
[1:19:33] <BioStormX> this was in the original GB game
[1:19:34] <oFlooofy> I mean they are called pocket-monsters LUL
[1:19:34] <wibbwobbler> Not the balls
[1:19:34] <+RobertWayneLewis98> NEW POWERS
[1:19:34] <%Mr_Pylon> Why are they all Ant Man?
[1:19:35] <MidnightPacif1c> coxBut
[1:19:35] <$heyitskevplays> Because HONOR
[1:19:36] <%sniffy77> wait are they just tumbling around in a backpack when they're not in use
[1:19:36] <ohno58> Dumbfuck worldbuilding
[1:19:36] <%Sotetsu> Like Pat's dick.
[1:19:36] <baxterd> Minimize
[1:19:37] <Mothraken> because shut up
[1:19:38] <@ssjklyco> They decide while unconscious as well.
[1:19:38] <%JobbedBone> but then why do they BURST OUT OF THE BALL
[1:19:39] <cpt_langosta> everyone knows minimize from the go
[1:19:39] <PlatinumWyvern> maybe the ball forces them small
[1:19:40] <DanThePumpkinman> FUCK YOU THAT'S HOW
[1:19:41] <+polothegreatest> They WANT to be IN the ball doodCrazy doodCrazy
[1:19:42] <TIME_PUNCHER> DON'T QUESTION SCIENCE PAT
[1:19:42] <%Cn_alpha_02> Thats what they believe.
[1:19:42] <+TopTieramisu> nanomachines
[1:19:43] <RAFIDELUXE> It’s so dumb
[1:19:43] <+rafaelba93> this is so fucking stupid
[1:19:44] <kapitankolin> I don't think it's that they DECIDE to be small, but that they CAN be small
[1:19:44] <jmepik> that's how minimize works Pat
[1:19:45] <%oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt is it too late to switch over to Mon Hun?
[1:19:45] <%cvp5127> ???
[1:19:46] <HotMafia81> They literally could have never explained that and no one would care
[1:19:46] <%baka_sugoi> woolieLORE
[1:19:46] <cartakus> Don't worry about it
[1:19:46] <$Jaxnos> you mean the move Minimize or whatever its called
[1:19:47] <$Pompadourius> FUCK THAT NOOOOOOOO
[1:19:49] <%Frost_Quill> @PatStaresAt There is a move called minimize that makes the Pokemon shrink.
[1:19:49] <%waltzqueen> THIS GUY IS DUMB AND WRONG
[1:19:49] <+sn0rlaxxxx> that would mean every pokemon would have to know minimize
[1:19:50] <%TheBensonator_> RECENT
[1:19:50] <%tank7013> Can every pokemon use minimize?
[1:19:51] <+Exicuren> Thanks gamefreak
[1:19:51] <+bytex678> only insane people get angry about these things
[1:19:53] <+ATorL> @PatStaresAt There's literally a move called Minimize that's been there since gen 1
[1:19:53] <baxterd> lmaoooo
[1:19:55] <vingadivo> BULLSHIT
[1:19:55] <%darklordfodder> Attacking them convinces them to shrink.
[1:19:58] <DancesWitBalrog> Onix shrinks himself LUL
[1:19:58] <@Ranryu692> hopefully this is just terrible localization
[1:19:58] <%CatastropheCorvid> THEN WHY DID THEY STRUGGLE TO GET OUT THE BALL?
[1:19:58] <+tnomads> they love it
[1:19:58] <+Dives__> Gamefreak staaaaahp
[1:19:58] <ahaegotrigger> this is so fucking stupid
[1:19:58] <$Momma_Shark_Sasha> the horniness exists from the developers in lore
[1:19:59] <%MisterRockett> MINIMIZE IS A REAL MOVE THAT RAISES EVASION
[1:19:59] <+unhuggable1> i fuckin hate pokemon now
[1:19:59] <cpt_langosta> recent invention? wtf?
[1:20:00] <Lozovalazo1> How does that work?
[1:20:00] <+TopTieramisu> L O R E
[1:20:01] <%BallerSwagBro9k> GAME FREEEEEEEAAAAAAAKKKKKKK
[1:20:02] <+BoocherOnTwitch> the move minimize and they pop out of the balls
[1:20:02] <%whatsittoya> psaWrong psaWrong psaWrong psaWrong psaWrong
[1:20:02] <$Bane_Kaikyo> I guess this is also supposed to explain why why pokemon faint they appear to shrink?
[1:20:05] <%cade_calrayn> this guy is the saddest of sad sacks
[1:20:05] <SilverBrass> Wait. WHY DOESN'T EVERYTHING LEARD MINIMIZE?!
[1:20:06] <+victhebeard> this is side story garbage. this is like the JJ time line of star trek
[1:20:07] <+MidnightBasker> Wait isnt this in the past or something? Do you think this is just misunderstood science between Poke ball material and pokemon? LET ME COPE GOD DAMNIT
[1:20:07] <Vashido22> @PatStaresAt it really would have been better if they just went "pokeballs shrink them"
[1:20:07] <%darklordfodder> You beat them until they decide to shrink.
[1:20:09] <$Pompadourius> I think this doc's a quack, he doesn't know wtf he's talking about
[1:20:09] <%SaiyanShoto> It’s like the manga there’s a clear pokeball and they see a Pokémon sleeping in it
[1:20:09] <+2DSuperiority> remember the Pokemon Adventure manga?
[1:20:09] <%WeLucklessJacks> I think this professor's just an idiot.
[1:20:10] <streamtouched> is that why they appear from nowhere
[1:20:10] <wqorst> are pokeballs vore
[1:20:10] <@Ranryu692> look at his hat, he's clearly a bad professor
[1:20:10] <Ombrebird> this is mistranslated as shit
[1:20:12] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt that's not actually new, just obscure
[1:20:12] <GarbageQueenEllie> It's the medichlorians you guys
[1:20:12] <viviknight> Further proof this dude isn't a professor!
[1:20:13] <TopTierHarley> you are 15
[1:20:14] <Lozovalazo1> So it can shrink but the ball forces it?
[1:20:14] <wolfdogf> Poor translation
[1:20:15] <%TheBensonator_> psaBig psaHoldon
[1:20:16] <%JobbedBone> why do they get in the ball and then FIGHT THEIR WAY OUT, then?!
[1:20:16] <%Dakuu75> so they are little just jumbling around in a tiny room
[1:20:17] <%TheGreatSkenardo> maybe this guy is grazy
[1:20:17] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> I don't think it's voluntary
[1:20:19] <Axlbullet> Doesn’t that mean that every pokemon knows MINITURIZE?
[1:20:19] <ReiDuran> POCKET MONSTERS
[1:20:20] <TopTierHarley> it's an isekai so you're an adult
[1:20:20] <+yoshkosh20> look at his dress sense. you're clearly more competent.
[1:20:20] <%OverzealousEuthanasiast> maybe mixed in localisation translation?
[1:20:20] <%MyNameIsRasus> Please 10 year old I need you for some reason
[1:20:23] <senfood> That raises so many questions...
[1:20:24] <GeneralHysterics> I LACK THE HAND-EYE COORDINATION TO USE MY INVENTION
[1:20:24] <+tnomads> what if he's just lying
[1:20:25] <%Anime_Flux> "professor" my ass
[1:20:26] <%waltzqueen> psaWrong
[1:20:26] <ShadeTheNovice> Is it mistranslated?
[1:20:26] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Play the game like a rogue assassin and please note that you can MOVE during battle, it's to setup throwing the ball from different angles specifically to "Backstab" it with a ball
[1:20:27] <%Frodiddly> does the ball like... trigger them shrinking or something...??? the fuuuck
[1:20:27] <+OrangeMDT> So all Pokémon are Ant-Man
[1:20:28] <A_German_spy> @PatStaresAt Shush, just treat it like post-DS1 lore. Nod, smile and don't question it.
[1:20:28] <Xelgus> that *has* to be like a translation error or a "look at these old idiots and their backwards science" bit
[1:20:29] <+polothegreatest> Tis is prehistoric explanation LUL
[1:20:31] <jbrachob> thats just what they told this dumb ass because it would be too hard to explain the science behind pokeballs
[1:20:31] <TopTierHarley> chat, it's not poor translation
[1:20:33] <%RaikOuija> The monster shrinks itself not the ball
[1:20:35] <ToneBacas> wow 50
[1:20:35] <sheepysenka> what word?
[1:20:35] <%SuckerPunchSyd> This is the saddest professor oh my god
[1:20:37] <BliVru> @patstaresat the Pokemon mod for Elden Ring is just gonna make this so irrelevant
[1:20:37] <%SuckerPunchSyd> LUL
[1:20:40] <baxterd> he's clearly insane and rambling
[1:20:41] <%Mr_Pylon> So they operate like reverse goldfish?
[1:20:41] <Doodicus110> Oh boy, I wonder how long the tutorial is. 2020Snacking
[1:20:42] <%MyNameIsRasus> HOW WOULD YOU RUN OUT OF BALLS
[1:20:43] <scrumbotime> Pat will never run out of balls, if anything he'll get more of them.
[1:20:44] <%Broand> Snindaquoal
[1:20:45] <%pokefan9956> I want somebody later in the game to just go "no. this guy doesn't know what he's talking about"
[1:20:46] <%waltzqueen> @A_German_spy oh hey franz! nice seeing you here

[1:22:55] <%cooldude69xx> They secretly all love the ball Pay
[1:22:55] <+Dives__> Pokemon love to be enslaved
[1:22:55] <%RetroCop87> yeah, pokedex entries always describe how pokemon used to always terrorize people
[1:22:55] <%Delenay> you dont have to wait for the catch

[1:22:57] <SaltyAzteca> subservient pokemon
[1:22:57] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt the okeball forces the minimization, this isnt new lore
[1:22:58] <Profmcstevie> Too weak to fight the ball
[1:22:59] <%Anime_Flux> I'm inclined to believe the professor just doesn't know what he's talking about
[1:23:00] <DianaTheAscian> @patstaresat the ball locks them in
[1:23:00] <%BallerSwagBro9k> They're submissive
[1:23:04] <$Jaxnos> that's propaganda, maaaan
[1:23:06] <+victhebeard> is this the skyward sword of pokemon?
[1:23:06] <%JustToWatch> because of your overwhelming charisma
[1:23:07] <%baka_sugoi> Choose later?
[1:23:08] <Majin_Kuum> the pokeball forces them to shrink
[1:23:08] <+Gouf_Troop> you got to weaken them down
[1:23:08] <cpt_langosta> use the y button to spank the hat man into submission, then throw pokeball at him
[1:23:09] <%TheGreatSkenardo> There are powerful narcotics in the pokeballs
[1:23:09] <%marvel877> THIS IS THEIR NATURAL STATE.
[1:23:10] <linSP> How has mankind not gotten wiped out by pokemon

[1:23:14] <%Valdorick> Balls force it on them.
[1:23:15] <+ReallyBigRocks> P(okemon) is stored in the balls
[1:23:15] <%waltzqueen> @PatStaresAt this man is a liar. simple

[1:23:20] <%JobbedBone> its the BALLS FAULT?
[1:23:20] <+Aheg0d> The Pokeball breaks their will
[1:23:21] <SweepTheLegoMyEggo> Pokemon are stored in the balls
[1:23:21] <+RobertWayneLewis98> ???????
[1:23:22] <tolloponik> the ball forces them to do that
[1:23:22] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> No they didn't they said it's possible for them to become small
[1:23:24] <%BlackStarAura> slavery
[1:23:24] <$zyberion626> I *think* they mean pokemon HAVE THE ABILITY to shrink, and the pokeballs force them to
[1:23:24] <xbb1024> Unreliable professor
[1:23:25] <@Ranryu692> man Typhlosion sucks so much ass
[1:23:25] <TechnocoloredCat> its a defense mechanism xD
[1:23:27] <%cade_calrayn> Pat this is a crazy old man talking to a 15-year-old who just FELL OUT OF THE SKY. why are you taking him for a reasonable person
[1:23:27] <%TamsynRRD> I don’t know about you, Pat, but I don’t really care.  XD
[1:23:27] <ReiDuran> see? not voluntary
[1:23:27] <MayorRev> Can't catch em without consent that's immoral
[1:23:28] <cartakus> Beat it
[1:23:28] <GeneralHysterics> the pokeball breaking is a result of a moral failing on your part
[1:23:28] <%cooldude69xx> @legendfather_of_giants That isnt what the game said
[1:23:29] <+RobertWayneLewis98> is it the ball or the pokemon??
[1:23:29] <%MyNameIsRasus> you see, this notch in the pokemon skull indicates subservience
[1:23:29] <EynoStiles> Wait so all that bullshit about go into the tall grass is just a lie
[1:23:30] <%Valdorick> Its like how water makes PP shrink.
[1:23:31] <DancesWitBalrog> does this game take place in the past ?
[1:23:32] <+Mechanized82> theres heroin in pokeballs
[1:23:32] <+MrSuplexArt> I took it as meaning the pokeball forces are tricks them into using the shrink
[1:23:33] <lucasoptics> pokeballs have hookers and blackjack inside

[1:32:53] <+MelodyMedley> Three?!
[1:32:55] <%Mr_Pylon> See, this is what happens when you don't teach the kids how to throw the football
[1:32:56] <RyuuAoi> Fuck dem pokeymin
[1:32:57] <+RobertWayneLewis98> The pokemon game where using child labor makes sense.
[1:32:58] <SaltyAzteca> their balls aren't strong enough
[1:32:58] <$PinkertonDanPie> wait till pat unlocks customisation and makes his poke child balding
[1:33:02] <ohno58> LEAVE GAIJIN

[1:33:18] <sheepysenka> EAT FEARLESSLY
[1:33:22] <senfood> oh no Cyllene is gap moe
[1:33:23] <Latija> i like how pat refuses to say survey corps
[1:33:23] <+tomdwarf> So, its implying that Pokemon arent seen as pets/battle buddies, but more "Wild monsters with weird powers to be feared"
[1:33:24] <cpt_langosta> sounded like duke cooking in re8
[1:33:27] <GeneralHysterics> @Dakuu75 god I wish
[1:33:30] <+ReallyBigRocks> eventually yeah
[1:33:31] <StarMechV> Pat the people are acting weird cause you're in ancient times as a stranger from the future in a town surrounded by magical beasts thay just right now they learned how to.make pokeballs. THIS IS THE MOST REALISTIC PORTRAYAL OF POKEMON EVER

[1:38:14] <+Exicuren> Throw the kid into a pit full of Rattatas, to build up character
[1:38:15] <$Pompadourius> IT'S IMPOSSIBLE NO WAY
[1:38:16] <%ShinobiPhoenix> calm, scared and VIOLENT

[1:38:21] <Angerest> And Exodia
[1:38:22] <%LastHazzerd> That's the most powerful card in dual monsters!
[1:38:23] <%YakumoYomi> @OkamiDude15 Territorial Rotbart strikes again!
[1:38:23] <%ShinobiPhoenix> this is still tutorial
[1:38:25] <%TheBensonator_> IMPOSSIBRU
[1:38:25] <sirtommygunn> I did not expect this game to be set in the modern day

[1:38:27] <EynoStiles> I already caught 3 pokemon and you guys have done shit yet

[1:38:29] <DSD24> That's cute
[1:38:30] <olm46> Eren you have to catch an armored titan.

[1:38:41] <+Mechanized82> reverse fanny pack
[1:38:41] <%oda_flobunaga> Fann'Y Pakk
[1:38:43] <Paltheos> The best part about all this buildup is that it justifies why everyone you'll meet to battle in this world will suck ass - No one can catch more than 1 pokemon.
[1:38:43] <Lozovalazo1> At least he looks sad
[1:38:43] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> I'm already finished with my chocolate bar and we're not even done with the intro...I thought I'd be stronger

[1:43:55] <BliVru> music is really loud
[1:43:57] <+tomdwarf> I kinda wish it was an ATB system, something like Yakuza 7, where your pokemon's position and going through menus quickly was a skill
[1:43:57] <%blastyoboots> so this is Pokemon Origins?
[1:43:59] <+vandesdelca0> so is this just...like...pokemon but the dumb child can get in the way of the moves
[1:44:00] <%Valdorick> Battles aren't limited to 1v1 either... or locked to 2v2... may you not run into a gank squad of 1v3

[1:44:05] <+polothegreatest> DQ11 has this
[1:44:05] <+ReallyBigRocks> poe shun
[1:44:06] <%RayReborne> 60 goddamn
[1:44:07] <KingPelleas> 60 hp what?
[1:44:08] <+CaptainPyron> You have to move around to dodge real angry Pokemon.
[1:44:11] <gslayer14> you're doing it preg
[1:44:14] <+bytex678> Why do these games still use 25 year old sound effects...
[1:44:14] <TIME_PUNCHER> pat really can through those pocket nuts
[1:44:14] <$PinkertonDanPie> kid, you got the balls for this line of work
[1:44:24] <+tomdwarf> But that would be very complex, cause you'd have to completely rethink speed, weather, priority moves, etc.
[1:44:24] <DSD24> He just teleported
[1:44:26] <%cvp5127> bye rule 63 cynthia

[1:44:30] <gslayer14> @bytex678 nostalgia
[1:44:32] <fuji_n2> yeah Pokémon stats are all over the place in this game
[1:44:35] <%Sotetsu> So is it just this village that is afraid of Pokemon?
[1:44:42] <%cooldude69xx> @bytex678 Iconic
[1:44:44] <ToneBacas> monster hunter?
[1:44:46] <%MyNameIsRasus> Call me insane but I never liked the pokémon battle system, it's cool that they're trying new stuff
[1:44:47] <%ShinobiPhoenix> MONSTER HUNTER
[1:44:51] <Dunmarkh> monster hunter
[1:44:52] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Don't forget that you can shrink the pokeballs on your belt in the anime, so the Pokemon inside them get double-shrunk
[1:44:52] <Cynical_Canadian> Is Not!Barry in this game, or only Not!Dawn?
[1:44:53] <fuji_n2> bro 50 hp is nothing
[1:44:54] <cache_22> Pokemonster Hunter style map is neat.
[1:44:55] <+itslunchie> so i wonder if 'team galaxy' is a prelude to team galactic?
[1:44:57] <HotMafia81> What is this ugly yellow logo on everyone's clothes?
[1:44:59] <%Anime_Flux> I guess Fly is pointless now
[1:45:01] <+MelodyMedley> Mon hun
[1:45:05] <$PinkertonDanPie> @bytex678 they use 25 year old sound effects because they fell out of the plot hole in the sky
[1:45:08] <+Stormzcales_Lair> Oh you ain tget to the Monster hunter part yet
[1:45:09] <gslayer14> hunt those pocket monsters, preg!
[1:45:10] <fuji_n2> it's just Pokémon mon hun, legit
[1:45:12] <+tomdwarf> @itslunchie Definitely, I mean hell, the leader is a female Cyrus
[1:45:15] <+RobertWayneLewis98> its not true open world? its just sections?
[1:45:16] <+Shoosler> is  monster hunter stories 2 just the better pokemon game? seems like it
[1:45:18] <+polothegreatest> Dun dun duuuuun
[1:45:19] <%RayReborne> starly and shinx are good
[1:45:20] <+Zix_Serro> @HotMafia81 It's the Not-Team-Galactic logo.
[1:45:20] <Cynical_Canadian> This professor looks terrible
[1:45:21] <cpt_langosta> this game is delighting in wasting as much of your time as it can right up front, huh?
[1:45:25] <%VentWilsn> LUL
[1:45:26] <leaplearning> that face
[1:45:27] <%oda_flobunaga> Count those pixels
[1:45:27] <%BinaryFireball> man I bet professor gets high af
[1:45:27] <$PinkertonDanPie> MMM SO TASTY
[1:45:32] <wqorst> i hate his bomberman hat so much
[1:45:32] <DSD24> "You are going to jail if those kids die"
[1:45:33] <@Ranryu692> @cpt_langosta it's a pokemon game
[1:45:35] <+MelodyMedley> @RobertWayneLewis98 They're pretty big sections
[1:45:36] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @itslunchie did the big yellow Team Galactic proto symbol give that away?
[1:45:42] <+tomdwarf> @RobertWayneLewis98 yeah, just sections that you explore, with a base village to go back to
[1:45:44] <cartakus> Why does he keep coming back?
[1:45:45] <+itslunchie> @RobertWayneLewis98 it looks like a mix of open world areas....kind of like monster hunter?
[1:45:49] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> At least NotDawn is better than Hop
[1:45:50] <ToneBacas> @HotMafia81 i'm guessing you'll need fly and other abilities to cross "bridges" or other obstacles that keep you from traveling across zones
[1:45:50] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Damn
[1:45:50] <Paltheos> ... what does responsibility mean though? I thought the kid was just going to be expelled if he didn't pass.
[1:45:51] <+Stormzcales_Lair> Catch bidoof, then you can run off
[1:45:51] <vingadivo> reminder that humans eating pokemons is cannon
[1:45:51] <+ReallyBigRocks> :O
[1:45:52] <Cynical_Canadian> So is she your Handler?
[1:45:54] <%cooldude69xx> @cpt_langosta It is an RPG, yes. Welcome to the genre
[1:45:55] <Th0ms0nStuart> I mean, as far as games to take inspiration from mon hunter is a pretty good one
[1:45:55] <%baka_sugoi> don't die child
[1:45:57] <reonome> wrong game pat LUL
[1:46:00] <BushBabyL> @Cynical_Canadian But what if he took the hat off and had long flowing hair like Finn?
[1:46:03] <%ShinobiPhoenix> maybe the fact I am CURRENLY wearing a Team Galactic outfit in my game as we speak
[1:46:03] <sheepysenka> breathtaking I guess!
[1:46:05] <cartakus> lol
[1:46:06] <@QueequegTheater> This is a way better Handler than MHW
[1:46:07] <%RayReborne> WOW. it looks TERRIBLE
[1:46:08] <%baka_sugoi> ITS SO bland
[1:46:08] <$PinkertonDanPie> you need to do something about the giant plot hole in the sky. it's killing the frame rate.
[1:46:08] <NeonLight> BIDOOF
[1:46:09] <Exeerdna> she threatened my life, let the children handle it
[1:46:10] <%oda_flobunaga> Eeeeeeewwww

[1:46:29] <+Daigrey> Bidoof!!!
[1:46:30] <+EveningMars> You don't want to miss it around ALL THOSE OTHER Pokemon
[1:46:32] <gslayer14> a real lack of obsidian for obsidian hills, huh
[1:46:33] <%Sotetsu> Whoever translated the name Bidoof needs a raise.
[1:46:33] <DSD24> What are you talking about this looks great
[1:46:33] <Cynical_Canadian> Fuck him up Bidoof!
[1:46:34] <%legendfather_of_giants> @CanadianAnimatorGuy its bidoof, that just makes it better
[1:46:34] <%ShinobiPhoenix> you can lock ono, but manual is better to aim
[1:46:34] <$StrawberryPantsu> This game doesn't look nearly as bad as people made it out to look.
[1:46:35] <%MugenSandan> but how can you catch A GOD
[1:46:37] <cpt_langosta> HOPELESSLY ADDICTED TO HENTAI

[1:47:06] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Student project to be fair
[1:47:06] <+Ancopro> wheres our silent hill fog
[1:47:06] <%bevyrage> in the leak the trees didn't fade in, they only popped in when they could be fully rendered
[1:47:07] <ZeeJiggle> It's fiiiiine
[1:47:07] <%optimasmaximas> this game needed a couple YEARS
[1:47:08] <Laecerelius> Murder that bidoof!
[1:47:09] <%Sotetsu> It's so ugly :(
[1:47:09] <GarbageQueenEllie> Did Todd Howard make this?
[1:47:10] <Paltheos> They appear to be all the same tree.
[1:47:11] <%JamesCorck> Oh yeah, it was like that in Sword and Shield lol
[1:47:11] <%ShinobiPhoenix> gameplay > graphics
[1:47:11] <yaboi_raidshadowlegends> pat it's ok to emulate at 4k60 you own a copy so no guilt needed :)
[1:47:14] <ZeeJiggle> That's just how it was in the past.
[1:47:14] <bigrocksalt> Highest grossing media franchise in HISTORY
[1:47:14] <+BigBruthaThunda> like windwaker from 20 years ago
[1:47:14] <+Shoosler> there there is a LOT of foliage ok the draw distance CANT be that far
[1:47:15] <%cooldude69xx> @CanadianAnimatorGuy I hope Bidoof shows up as a post-game super boss and hes rad as hell
[1:47:15] <%JamesCorck> Draw distances lol
[1:47:17] <+EveningMars> @ToneBacas Level of Existence
[1:47:17] <robobeau> in today's episode Pat discovers pop in
[1:47:17] <Cynical_Canadian> Damn it Bidoof, FIGHT
[1:47:18] <+MosesUnspoken> No expense spared
[1:47:19] <KonekoSilvertail> this game has the CRUNCHY graphics
[1:47:20] <%BinaryFireball> the game is super ugly lol
[1:47:20] <+ReallyBigRocks> top 10 most valuable media franchise of all time
[1:47:23] <+Stormzcales_Lair> Now go Explore some shit
[1:47:24] <$PinkertonDanPie> just bean him in the head
[1:47:24] <Teyaric> So how does this thing emulate? Do we know yet?
[1:47:24] <justachap> Nintendo Switch, huh?
[1:47:27] <cartakus> Game freak why are you like this?
[1:47:27] <Ghostduck01> WutFace
[1:47:30] <%Kaask> Kaask subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 29 months, currently on a 4 month streak!
[1:47:30] <%MyNameIsRasus> @ShinobiPhoenix the gameplay so far is the most mid shit ever too
[1:47:33] <Blank9> I'm amazed at this being visually worse than like, dragon quest 8 on ps2
[1:47:33] <DancesWitBalrog> N64 IS BACK BAYBEE
[1:47:34] <tolloponik> only 2 technical artist at game freak
[1:47:34] <%brisk_dacat> Yeah that’s some mid quality right there
[1:47:34] <Cynical_Canadian> Some tasty pop in
[1:47:35] <%rumtumtugnutz> It’s rendering on. A Cellphone
[1:47:36] <richmon__> this games a mastah piece
[1:47:37] <+bytex678> @BinaryFireball your MOM is
[1:47:38] <%Ironbuttz> the run is so bouncy
[1:47:41] <%SaphronBlackbourne> @Teyaric Stable 30 FPS on Ryujinx
[1:47:41] <%BinaryFireball> because people keep buying
[1:47:41] <+tomdwarf> Yeah, Game Freak, for whatever reason, doesn't get any money or increased staff from the billions pokemon makes. Its absolutely baffling.
[1:47:41] <DSD24> Cute again
[1:47:42] <%marvel877> This isn't even a Switch problem, this is a Pokemon Company / Game Freak problem.
[1:47:43] <%notsoy> staraptor is best early bird
[1:47:48] <Dunmarkh> Staraptor is cool
[1:47:48] <TehMud> They REALLY should've asked Monolith Soft to help with the open world like they did with BotW.
[1:47:50] <WaxWitch> one step forward, two steps back
[1:47:51] <californaya> B for Brouch
[1:47:52] <%baka_sugoi> Pat confirmed Bird Main
[1:47:53] <%BinaryFireball> @bytex678 Uhh noo..no.nooooooo
[1:47:53] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @MyNameIsRasus then why are you here?
[1:47:54] <+Photonicfab> thats a happy lil birbo
[1:47:58] <Angerest> its barely in ps3 quality
[1:47:59] <DSD24> Staraptor has cool hair
[1:48:03] <+Shoosler> move over pidgey
[1:48:03] <%oda_flobunaga> The reason this series is such a money maker is because of how little money they spend to make them
[1:48:04] <+zenraider> pat you should nickname rowlett
[1:48:06] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Isn't Dragon Quest 11 on Switch?
[1:48:07] <%MyNameIsRasus> @ShinobiPhoenix pat's a funny dude
[1:48:08] <Virokwet> headshot
[1:48:08] <GeneralHysterics> snake?
[1:48:08] <$PinkertonDanPie> your Arceus phone is going to start talking crap about that Bidoof you caught.
[1:48:09] <+Stormzcales_Lair> Its a TCPi issue, not even Gamefreak has control
[1:48:09] <+RobertWayneLewis98> gewd grass
[1:48:13] <GeneralHysterics> SNAKE?
[1:48:13] <Cynical_Canadian> Akari, I'm trying to catch Pokemon, but the clap of my orb keeps alerting them
[1:48:13] <Parapattern> He shrank down of his own will!
[1:48:15] <%RonaldMcDownload> The Ghost Type of Sushima
[1:48:15] <DSD24> @CanadianAnimatorGuy Yeah it is
[1:48:17] <%cooldude69xx> Reactions like this are part of the reason devs get crunched to death to make the shiniest graphics possible
[1:48:17] <$Pompadourius> This is like PS2.5
[1:48:17] <%rumtumtugnutz> …hello.
[1:48:18] <+hannwaters> Honestly, given a game like Omensight runs like utter dog shot on the Switch, this is somewhat more impressive than I thought it would be visually
[1:48:19] <%TheLemuroid> Such an impossible trial
[1:48:20] <%croxeye> this is ps2 quality
[1:48:20] <KyberNasse> Are you feeling scammed yet?
[1:48:20] <%Sotetsu> Throw a rock at 'em
[1:48:24] <+Daigrey> I hope it'
[1:48:26] <+tomdwarf> Why make the games look or perform better? This shit prints money!
[1:48:27] <%ironbologna> Small indie dev game freak inc
[1:48:29] <Togamdiron> Doom 2016 runs on the Switch. There's really no excuse.
[1:48:30] <+ATorL> Being on Switch isn't an excuse when BotW looked much better years ago.
[1:48:30] <ComradeConquistador> It looks like a Gamecube game, but I honestly don't mind.
[1:48:33] <+RobertWayneLewis98> rule of threes
[1:48:34] <+polothegreatest> at least this mechanic is cool
[1:48:35] <+Complete_Phased> @tomdwarf THat is because their CEO wants to keep the team small for some reason they think Pokemon isnt one of the biggest IP in the world
[1:48:36] <+Daigrey> Please be another Bidoof
[1:48:36] <roguemephilesclone> Monolith Soft DID work on this. It's still like this.
[1:48:40] <%Sirtimbob> I just got here, whats Pats impression so far?
[1:48:43] <DancesWitBalrog> even the PS3 can do better graphics than this
[1:48:45] <%Anime_Flux> Really? The ROCKS?
[1:48:54] <+sonofrobin73> Throw rocks at the pokemon
[1:48:54] <+tomdwarf> I dont think the devs are lazy, I think this is a management issue.
[1:48:56] <Virokwet> neat
[1:49:00] <+Stormzcales_Lair> can do all 6 gathering
[1:49:00] <Cynical_Canadian> It looks better than the trailer at least, but yikes
[1:49:02] <DSD24> Damn Xenoblade 2 looks better then this and no shade on that game either
[1:49:03] <BushBabyL> @ATorL Didn't the trees look similar in BotW? My memory's fuzzy
[1:49:03] <Togamdiron> @Anime_Flux Rocks provide extra friction.
[1:49:04] <%ShinobiPhoenix> the changes to the battle system are so much better than Pokemon has ever been
[1:49:05] <%oda_flobunaga> @DancesWitBalrog PS2 even
[1:49:07] <+Shoosler> i like the way that pokeball looks
[1:49:07] <$Pompadourius> The PS3 can manage better than this, let's not sell it short. lmao
[1:49:12] <Paltheos> @oda_flobunaga It's not just 'revenue from game - expenses'. I remember looking at sales totals in the past, and most of the money from pokemon doesn't come from the games. It's from merchandising.
[1:49:14] <californaya> HNNNG
[1:49:16] <+Complete_Phased> @DancesWitBalrog the PS3 is more powerful than the switch
[1:49:16] <DSD24> Shinx is also a cutie
[1:49:19] <Parapattern> This is late PS2 graphics
[1:49:21] <Virokwet> oh i love these, thier evos are cool
[1:49:21] <GeneralHysterics> cute little buddy
[1:49:25] <%Hamborgini> those are the eyes of a killer for sure
[1:49:26] <Angerest> kick his ass
[1:49:27] <@QueequegTheater> I love Shinx
[1:49:27] <+polothegreatest> Imagine if pkm had a budget doodmaxhype
[1:49:28] <%marvel877> If they werent busy with Zelda, I'd wish the Xenoblade devs would make a Pokemon game.
[1:49:28] <Cynical_Canadian> @Togamdiron Classic
[1:49:31] <+vandesdelca0> good things cost money, so we can't have good things
[1:49:32] <Dunmarkh> Shinx has the killer instinct
[1:49:33] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> @tomdwarf 100% management
[1:49:34] <+ReallyBigRocks> the actual gameplay and everything seems really fun and interesting, it just looks like dump
[1:49:35] <+Shoosler> dude some ps2 shimmer would improve these bland graphics
[1:49:38] <%MugenSandan> Look at that Shinx with murder in its heart
[1:49:38] <%ShinobiPhoenix> and even indies don't usually do it because most are still trying to clone old Pokemon and miss the ppoint making it about BATTLE instead ofCATCHING
[1:49:40] <yaboi_raidshadowlegends> are you excited for the gen v remakes? :)
[1:49:40] <Saltmeisterr> @hannwaters aww really? was hoping to pick that up on the switch
[1:49:40] <cpt_langosta> i remember one of those did massive damage after jimmy page died. good times.
[1:49:41] <%MyNameIsRasus> this is almost below ffxii level graphics
[1:49:41] <GeneralHysterics> you need to flank and destroy the enemy
[1:49:48] <jbrachob> BEAT THEY ASS
[1:49:50] <%TheBensonator_> FIGHT THE POKEMON
[1:49:56] <+hybridcode7> The heck was that doom cloud
[1:50:00] <%cvp5127> they love it
[1:50:00] <%Tearonex> I'm blown away by how different this game is
[1:50:01] <KaijuUltimax> Why does it still look and run like a student Unity engine project
[1:50:03] <sheepysenka> oh god oh man
[1:50:03] <%XzileGaming> Michael Vick would probably be pretty good at Pokemon
[1:50:06] <Cynical_Canadian> Triggered
[1:50:09] <SaltyAzteca> ITS IRATE
[1:50:12] <+RobertWayneLewis98> OH LAWD
[1:50:13] <%BlackStarAura> toss then a fat BLUNT
[1:50:14] <Pistofficer> in the face!
[1:50:15] <%ShinobiPhoenix> you can backstab Mons with balls to
[1:50:19] <TopTierHarley> @hybridcode7 that's where you isekai'd from
[1:50:19] <%chiluzza> it looks so cute to committ murder on
[1:50:21] <gslayer14> shinx pog
[1:50:21] <slandracon> @patstaresat BTW you can throw out multiple bois to run with you at once, at least I've seen that on twitter
[1:50:23] <+ReallyBigRocks> huck balls
[1:50:24] <+tomdwarf> I believe Shinx is JUST electric, not Normal/Electric
[1:50:27] <Cynical_Canadian> Leafage?
[1:50:27] <JetpackMcQuack> that piano's having a bad day
[1:50:28] <%Anime_Flux> so far the soundtrack is the only thing I like
[1:50:31] <fugly_nick> This remix is pretty alright
[1:50:33] <+AnbeiH> its not even just graphics. i feel like a strong art/design direction can soften the limitations
[1:50:33] <+Shoosler> "LEAFage" *shoots green balls*
[1:50:33] <+ATorL> @BushBabyL it's been a while but I don't recall pop in being nearly this bad, and BotW didn't skimp on the trees and stuff.
[1:50:36] <vingadivo> can't wait for the inevitable pat dies to a lvl 39 snorlax moment
[1:50:39] <%ShinobiPhoenix> he;s ELECTRIC not normal electric
[1:50:52] <%ShinobiPhoenix> there's only one NOrmal electric
[1:50:53] <%bevyrage> man they're just pulling punches in this handholding tutorial. luckily enough the game is actually different enough to warrant needing some hand holding
[1:50:54] <+ReallyBigRocks> :O
[1:50:58] <KingPelleas> WET
[1:50:58] <%XzileGaming> this game looks pretty hard
[1:50:58] <%optimasmaximas> cant wait til pat notices all the purple rocks
[1:50:58] <vingadivo> :O
[1:51:01] <%marvel877> Its an electric type, Pat.
[1:51:02] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> She looked horrified lol
[1:51:03] <Cynical_Canadian> Remember, they're apparently choosing to shrink down
[1:51:03] <%RayReborne> wowwee zowie
[1:51:05] <TopTierHarley> no you have to catch it
[1:51:07] <jmepik> cantaPoggies
[1:51:11] <knight_verse> BotW was about as empty of content as it looked good.
[1:51:11] <%Hamborgini> I can't believe pat wasn't afraid of the tiny baby animals
[1:51:12] <+RobertWayneLewis98> wow you're soooooo cooooooool\
[1:51:14] <+Stormzcales_Lair> Pat is acually able to run off on  his own now
[1:51:14] <+MelodyMedley> D:
[1:51:15] <%MyNameIsRasus> Survey Corps? Is Erwin there?
[1:51:16] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Look at all the blue rocks Kappa
[1:51:16] <zirishirishi> Did you get isekai'd into this world?
[1:51:17] <Cynical_Canadian> They shall worship him as their new god
[1:51:19] <steve_the_suus> good thing girls watching
[1:51:20] <Paltheos> With this, the Survey Corps can defeat the titans for sure and reclaim our homes.
[1:51:20] <+Shoosler> when do these 2 hook up
[1:51:23] <Angerest> Polkadex sounds fun
[1:51:24] <%TheBensonator_> "You did what Pokemon people do?! Inconceivable!"
[1:51:27] <%matf8> Remember, capturing 3 pokemon was literally an impossible task for everyone else
[1:51:29] <%robotoken> robotoken subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months! 8 months of content from my favorite streamer. Looking good there Greg
[1:51:30] <SaltyAzteca> came from the skanus
[1:51:32] <+MelodyMedley> @maddogzirishi Yes. Literally
[1:51:33] <TopTierHarley> D:
[1:51:34] <DancesWitBalrog> you shook their will to stay normal size
[1:51:34] <BushBabyL> @ATorL Personally the visuals look okay to me, but the thing that gets under my skin is the reused character animations since Sun/Moon

[1:51:56] <%Kaask> what era is this
[1:52:01] <%the_Punktuation> you blinked
[1:52:02] <baxterd> I like the color design and the rendering on the pokemon
[1:52:05] <cpt_langosta> isekai means you have free reign to poop all over the floor and walls with no consequence
[1:52:06] <%CapnClassix> Why are the shadows so purple? WutFace
[1:52:07] <TIME_PUNCHER> why is their technological level SO INCONSISTENT
[1:52:08] <+hybridcode7> lo
[1:52:08] <%twistedj3ster> Wow, that hair color is perfect /s
[1:52:09] <+DatAsuna> definitely looks like a mobile game tho

[1:52:42] <Cynical_Canadian> That phrase causes me pain
[1:52:43] <%YakumoYomi> @yoshkosh20 Came out today
[1:52:44] <+lukedu_> bad tifa
[1:52:44] <+Stormzcales_Lair> Today is release day
[1:52:45] <Guardiansaiyan> AERITH IS HERE
[1:52:48] <@QueequegTheater> @yoshkosh20 Pat would not leak a game before release
[1:52:48] <baxterd> the muted, twilight art design lends to the sparse, natural vibe
[1:52:49] <+lukedu_> go to italy
[1:52:51] <Guardiansaiyan> SEPHIROTH CONFIRMED
[1:52:52] <DancesWitBalrog> are there gym leaders and elite four in this game?
[1:52:53] <+TaurusOxford> @Pompadourius Husui trainers are all jobbers.
[1:52:53] <%cade_calrayn> y'all they literally invented Pokeballs *LAST MONTH*
[1:52:53] <%SaiyanShoto> Get used to eating eggs for breakfast
[1:52:53] <%DovaDude29> @patstaresat real talk, it would of been a better start if it was just taking place in the old time / long ago, no isekai nonsense. Just give em a arceus map scroll instead or something, lmao
[1:52:54] <dirtydovens> in the hisui region everyone SUCKS at throwing balls
[1:52:57] <cpt_langosta> are they divorce tiktoks?
[1:52:58] <+tomdwarf> @DamnFineCupofStreaming I mean, Pokemon always had weird technology, like its modern with phones, but we also have teleporters, but just for pokemon though.
[1:52:59] <Kaji04> The era looks Edo-ish
[1:53:01] <$spleekle> eww tiktoks
[1:53:04] <Paltheos> I was saying before - This is awesome. It's a pokemon game where *canonically* everyone else sucks except for you. It's officlal now.
[1:53:04] <Guardiansaiyan> Where are the WHISPERS?! Where is YUFFIE?
[1:53:07] <Blank9> regular trainers in mainline games never manage to catch 6 pokemon either, why else would they fight you with a team of 2 total
[1:53:08] <%JustToWatch> better than vore porn
[1:53:09] <kbonez2> why does this open world look like the foothills of alabama
[1:53:10] <%MugenSandan> No one's got heavy enough balls for SIX POKEMON psaDogchamp
[1:53:17] <HotMafia81> I thought it was canon that they just arbitrarily settled on six pokemon, but there was no actual limit?
[1:53:21] <+Shoosler> more like dik-koks
[1:53:21] <%VentWilsn> honestly i believe it, anything past Black and White 2, 99% of trainers have max 4 pokemon
[1:53:21] <$Pompadourius> @Pompadourius Apparently so. LUL
[1:53:23] <+rbakervv> @Pompadourius because pokeballs were just invented, like this year, they are still figurering out catching and training pokemon
[1:53:24] <+Stormzcales_Lair> It'll probabaly blow up next week, and m ppl will MEME the graphics to shit if they aren't already
[1:53:27] <roguemephilesclone> Comparing this game's graphics to mobile games is not the insult it used to be.
[1:53:28] <%CapnClassix> Pat would NEVER convince someone to break street date KappaRoss
[1:53:29] <%Anime_Flux> masaka
[1:53:35] <%baka_sugoi> 6 is a BIG number
[1:53:37] <@QueequegTheater> @VentWilsn Man, gen 5 was so good
[1:53:37] <yyyyfdugyu> pokemon arceSUS 😳
[1:53:38] <+RobertWayneLewis98> surely that was the end of the tutorial
[1:53:38] <+ATorL> @BushBabyL I don't have a problem with the style either, it's mostly just that Gamefreak seems to have no technical expertise. Like it's embarrassing that the trailers had horrible frame rate, though thankfully it seems they fixed that for launch. Still very unimpressive that The Pokemon Company doesn't seem to want to spend money making the games look like they earn the money that they do.
[1:53:38] <%JustToWatch> Thanks
[1:53:42] <cpt_langosta> goddamn, levi, why is your name plaque so low res?
[1:53:43] <sheepysenka> pokemon are SCARY
[1:53:45] <+vandesdelca0> six is official pokemon league standards I think
[1:53:46] <DancesWitBalrog> unseasoned food tiktoks are nightmare fuel
[1:53:47] <zirishirishi> Its crazy, its impossible, This Crazy brave person from another world caught THREE POKEMON
[1:53:52] <Cynical_Canadian> No one's ever caught a Bidoof, truly worthy of a medal
[1:53:53] <$Pompadourius> LUL

[1:54:37] <Vileosis> @GemeSvev Cyrus' grandma probably
[1:54:41] <BushBabyL> @ATorL I agree! I think it's just the case of gamefreak needing to make annual games to keep the license for Pokemon games, hence why these things feel shallow
[1:54:42] <%twistedj3ster> pfffft
[1:54:42] <+Shoosler> YIKES

[1:56:28] <$Mekhet09> @PatStaresAt No. This is for otaku.
[1:56:28] <%Logoth_> It feels like FF14's "WOW I CANT BELIEVE YOU BEAT THE THING BY HITTING 3 BUTTONS"
[1:56:28] <+tomdwarf> Yeah, the fact that nobody can believe you snuck up and threw three balls at wild animals is insane.
[1:56:30] <Alt_Tab_streams> The textures are SUPER NOT GOOD
[1:56:31] <%twistedj3ster> those textures LUL
[1:56:32] <KinduVborrd> It's Pokemon. It is for children

[1:56:48] <+ATorL> @BushBabyL To some extent I do believe the annual releases hurt the quality, but Gamefreak isn't always the studio releasing a game each year, there are usually spinoffs like Snap and whatever going around. Gamefreak themselves make a lot of really bizarre and bad decisions in the games they do make.
[1:56:49] <+trizetacannon44> This Children's game is for children???

[1:58:05] <+tomdwarf> If they wanted to scare the player with strong ass pokemon, throw a tyranitar at us or something.
[1:58:07] <%chiazam> @patstaresat I think the point is you’re so used to Pokémon as this fun little video game that it doesn’t scare you
[1:58:07] <Tony2Dirty> Don’t worry you about to see some terrifying ones
[1:58:09] <DancesWitBalrog> you aint shit, child

[1:59:07] <Cynical_Canadian> What was the sound effect
[1:59:07] <$Pompadourius> It feels like they're trying to make a game with a bit more threat in its world, but the tone's fighting against it by still being an E rating.
[1:59:12] <+Shoosler> they couldn't even be bothered to do facial expressions
[1:59:14] <DSD24> I hope we can become "Demon Lord of the Round Table"

[2:11:20] <Mister_McDerp> small indie developer
[2:11:21] <TIME_PUNCHER> why is it so fucking basic
[2:11:22] <+TaurusOxford> @kewlmyc "mostly" 30
[2:11:22] <%greasypete00> i think it would actually look better without the vegetation
[2:11:22] <RoboKusko> You can take fall damage
[2:11:23] <markdreizehn> That's the Gamefreak seal of quality BABY
[2:11:23] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Nintendo please do not hire this man
[2:11:23] <vingadivo> HIGHEST GROSSIST FRANCHISE OF ALL TIME
[2:11:24] <+tomdwarf> Yeah, Game Freak can't hire 3x the employees and resources. Yep.
[2:11:27] <DancesWitBalrog> compare this is vanilla FF12 on PS2 LUL
[2:11:27] <cache_22> I wonder if this game would be better with Silent Hill fog.
[2:11:29] <Blank9> see that mountain? No? Get closer
[2:11:29] <Cynical_Canadian> MGSV wishes it was this /s
[2:11:29] <%marvel877> XENOBLADE IS ON THIS SYSTEM GOD DAMN IT
[2:11:30] <KyberNasse> Put some medicinal herbs on your eyes
[2:11:35] <LunarRemix> Small indie company please understand
[2:11:37] <TheDeimion> it regens , but ya you take fall damage
[2:11:38] <wqorst> @twistedj3ster I didn't want to say it but yep lol
[2:11:38] <CatRidder> they put all the money in this game
[2:11:40] <+Stormzcales_Lair> Tree shake
[2:11:41] <+Mechanized82> the highest grossing multimedia franchise in existence
[2:11:41] <TopTierHarley> Back attack
[2:11:41] <$Pompadourius> Most successful media franchise in the world here
[2:11:42] <%MechArch> "we got botw at home"
[2:11:44] <+ReallyBigRocks> i don't understand why everything gets so shiny when it's 10 ft away from you
[2:11:45] <MayShip> how do you take fall damage in pokemon?
[2:11:48] <+Shoosler> it really seems like this game was a huge rush job after people were tearing sword and shield a new asshole over it being a 3DS game basically
[2:11:48] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> @tomdwarf Masuda said that's too hard to manage so we get this
[2:11:49] <SaltyAzteca> Murder!!
[2:11:50] <%TheBensonator_> Basically every big review agreed that the game doesn't exactly look good, so... yeah
[2:11:51] <Laecerelius> MUUUUUURDAAAAAH!
[2:11:52] <+lukedu_> the color scheme really does this game no favors
[2:11:54] <BlazieTiger> Pokemon's got fuck you money so they don't have to put in effort
[2:11:58] <%ShinobiPhoenix> you should catch it
[2:12:00] <$IzazaOzihaha> Me looking at the graphics: "Oh no. Anyway,"
[2:12:01] <TheDeimion> I can't wait to see his reaction when he gets hit by  an attack LUL
[2:12:01] <psychoteletubby7> looks like a unity fan-game
[2:12:03] <teefpal> Makes more money than fucking Marvel
[2:12:07] <dan_g_v> what was hideous?
[2:12:09] <TopTierHarley> just attack
[2:12:10] <%BinaryFireball> still could have used botw engine or something
[2:12:13] <steve_the_suus> 2v1 bish
[2:12:14] <Bottulism> This actually looks decent
[2:12:15] <%RayReborne> go PIECE OF WOOD
[2:12:15] <Demon_chann> this  a job for bidoof
[2:12:16] <%twistedj3ster> @wqorst It needed to be said
[2:12:18] <%ShinobiPhoenix> ZR is still your ball button if you switch to items
[2:12:19] <marlowe86> Oh, I see. It is Breath of the Wild; Pokemon edition.
[2:12:20] <+kewlmyc> Is this a remix of the Sinnoh battle theme? Sounds familiar.
[2:12:20] <%SirGO0SE> i cant believe this has no multiplayer
[2:12:22] <+Manband20> Bidoof is GOD
[2:12:23] <yaboi_raidshadowlegends> gamefreak need to pump out games to so they can promote the cards and anime
[2:12:25] <DancesWitBalrog> oh no
[2:12:26] <+nochejunior> one day we'll have a AAA Pokemon game, i believe
[2:12:27] <TheDeimion> YEEEE
[2:12:27] <illicitdonut> Can we get the switch sequel now please?
[2:12:28] <HotMafia81> Pokemon Company was not really ready to make this game, I don't think. Or Nintendo won't give them a budget to maximize ROI.
[2:12:28] <%AgniBrandt> This game's existence is so frustrating. It looks like shit, doesn't appear to run much better, but gameplay-wise it looks like everything I ever wanted from Pokemon
[2:12:28] <leaplearning> catch it
[2:12:29] <%ShinobiPhoenix> but reposition yuoruself to backstab
[2:12:30] <ToneBacas> they all get xp?
[2:12:31] <Cynical_Canadian> Fuck yeah Bidoof
[2:12:31] <TheDeimion> Kreygasm Bidoof win
[2:12:32] <+Stormzcales_Lair> Tree shake my guy
[2:12:32] <%greasypete00> does gamefreak just not have or know a single person who can work well in 3d
[2:12:36] <Laecerelius> Bidoof, transform and roll out!
[2:12:37] <Blank9> it's wild that monolith soft can make a world for botw and splatoon 2's dlc and they won't use them for pokemon
[2:12:43] <%chiazam> Pat you’re supposed to catch those
[2:12:47] <+ReallyBigRocks> takul
[2:12:49] <%ShinobiPhoenix> rock better on electric
[2:12:49] <TheDeimion> hey Pat how close can you get to that fight? LUL
[2:12:50] <cpt_langosta> use the geth assault rifle
[2:12:52] <Pookiedaexzile> This does in fact not look pretty good
[2:12:53] <Doodicus110> The DOOF is here!
[2:12:56] <$Pompadourius> It's not just that it's bad, it's distracting when it's got a cartoony aesthetic for its characters and a subpar realistic aesthetic for its world. It clashes SO hard.
[2:12:59] <Stickythings> !uptime
[2:13:00] <@Moobot> @Stickythings I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 13m.
[2:13:02] <TheDeimion> wowooww
[2:13:03] <SaltyAzteca> Rollout before tackle? wow
[2:13:03] <%ShinobiPhoenix> not weak, jsut better
[2:13:05] <yaboi_raidshadowlegends> monolith would like to take their time and the pokemon company won't allow that
[2:13:07] <+Manband20> Run up and kick the bastard
[2:13:10] <%ShinobiPhoenix> backstab ball
[2:13:13] <Bottulism> KICK THAT POKEMON FROM BEHIND
[2:13:13] <TheDeimion> get rekt Shinx
[2:13:13] <%TheLemuroid> tackle should do more because of STAB
[2:13:17] <%Dakuu75> So far... this looks like it coula been a fan-game
[2:13:17] <TheDeimion> you were a binch
[2:13:18] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> GUYS it's a student project, be nice!!
[2:13:20] <Cynical_Canadian> Pat not gonna catch anything,just power level Bidoof
[2:13:21] <TheDeimion> LUL
[2:13:21] <+nochejunior> this game seems cool but from the trailers there are no gyms sadge
[2:13:21] <+Stormzcales_Lair> Get the shaking Tree
[2:13:23] <%twistedj3ster> break it's bones fairly quickly
[2:13:27] <DancesWitBalrog> jump that pokemon
[2:13:28] <+DrBunni> oh this looks good
[2:13:29] <+Shoosler> PALWORLD legitimately looks 50x better than this both in graphics and gameplay
[2:13:34] <fuji_n2> it's ugly but cool
[2:13:37] <TheDeimion> this could have gotten polished a lot
[2:13:39] <+sanhiei> Is this a pokeman?
[2:13:41] <steve_the_suus> oof
[2:13:45] <Cynical_Canadian> At least the trees are better than Sword and Shield
[2:13:45] <%oda_flobunaga> Count those pixils
[2:13:48] <TopTierHarley> The vignette
[2:13:48] <teefpal> Every time the camera turns I just start laughing
[2:13:49] <+Fetrigon> OMEGALUL
[2:13:50] <%MegadBlitz> run up and punt it
[2:13:50] <+Stormzcales_Lair> the vingyette
[2:13:51] <TopTierHarley> is your health
[2:13:52] <%marvel877> FALL DAMAGE
[2:13:53] <+DevinMayCry> The screen is the health
[2:13:53] <Dunmarkh> ah fuck my knees

[2:13:54] <%twistedj3ster> Big OOF
[2:13:55] <Cynical_Canadian> Ooph those textures

[2:13:57] <%ShinobiPhoenix> throw balls at Pokemon's backside during battle for critical catches
[2:13:57] <%epide> its the darkness pat
[2:13:58] <+hybridcode7> Wow
[2:13:59] <thebestesttrashpanda> CALL OF DUTY HEALTH
[2:13:59] <%SirGO0SE> they just cant make improvements without taking steps backwards
[2:13:59] <yaboi_raidshadowlegends> the qol changes to learning moves and evolution is so good, so gen 9 of course won't have them
[2:14:00] <DancesWitBalrog> fall damage???
[2:14:00] <%cade_calrayn> if you put asides the graphics, this game is a major improvement on the main series formula
[2:14:01] <dirtydovens> @greasypete00 well gamefreak is/was primarily made up of 2d/pixel artists so they dont know 3d
[2:14:01] <%clempstwitch> You haven't hit the other mechanics yet!! Yeah the visuals are... y'know. But its fun!
[2:14:02] <@QueequegTheater> It's the black ooze
[2:14:03] <ShadeTheNovice> The border is your health
[2:14:04] <TheDeimion> what is it?
[2:14:04] <%Tearonex> COD health
[2:14:05] <+Dives__> Looks like a PS2 game
[2:14:05] <sulkcessor> LUL
[2:14:05] <%Valdorick> I've seen uglier
[2:14:06] <cpt_langosta> that border shit looked more like you were being cursed than taking damage
[2:14:06] <%Birdigalore> Your health is the aura around the border/.  The darker it gets, the deader you are, but your health regens
[2:14:07] <+Shoosler> hhahaha
[2:14:10] <+ReallyBigRocks> why are the shadows purple?
[2:14:10] <Kiiper> I thought that pink shine on everything was an error lmao

[2:14:16] <+sanhiei> breath of the PS2
[2:14:17] <Kiiper> Nope, just morning lighting
[2:14:18] <TheDeimion> is that like an atrichoke?
[2:14:20] <chai_wolf> it's not ugly but ok lol
[2:14:20] <sussy_baka_999> lmfao
[2:14:22] <DSD24> PS2 Games look better than this
[2:14:23] <TheDeimion> sniffy no
[2:14:23] <Blank9> this looks like a dragon's dogma port to an iphone 5
[2:14:25] <+tomdwarf> You dont need to 100%
[2:14:25] <yaboi_raidshadowlegends> catch 25 LUL
[2:14:27] <TopTierHarley> Do your task
[2:14:27] <+Stormzcales_Lair> no do the RED arrow ones
[2:14:28] <$Pompadourius> GRIND PAT
[2:14:29] <fuji_n2> yup
[2:14:29] <+Rofiarf> you only need to get to level 10
[2:14:29] <%ShinobiPhoenix> just do that as you play
[2:14:31] <Demon_chann> Looks like shit but god its fun
[2:14:32] <rysku> you don't need to do all of them
[2:14:32] <thelonechris> That's a lot of grinding
[2:14:32] <%willyfreshness> jesus
[2:14:33] <%Dakuu75> enjoy your pokemon genocide
[2:14:33] <+DevinMayCry> To complete the mon you just need 10 points
[2:14:35] <%oda_flobunaga> GRIND
[2:14:35] <%cade_calrayn> you don't *have* to, you *can*
[2:14:35] <ahaegotrigger> have to catch 25
[2:14:35] <%Birdigalore> @PatStaresAt No you dont heave to do all of that
[2:14:38] <%TeenyTelly> You can totally “Skyrim” up slopes sometimes
[2:14:39] <cache_22> Rise and Grind Pat
[2:14:41] <Bottulism> Jump on that muthfucka
[2:14:41] <DanThePumpkinman> you don't need to d9 that many
[2:14:41] <Cynical_Canadian> That's some padding
[2:14:41] <+albertomtc> nooo you only have to do some
[2:14:41] <ahaegotrigger> defeat only 15
[2:14:42] <reonome> you don't have to do all that
[2:14:42] <+Rofiarf> so just complete 10 pips
[2:14:43] <+Extrallent> you don't need to do it all.
[2:14:44] <%sniffy77> if you dont need to do if you will feel like you need to do it
[2:14:44] <SixthShinx> You don't need to do all the tasks @PatStaresAt
[2:14:44] <vingadivo> sounds like a lot but it can be done pretty quickly
[2:14:45] <+nochejunior> it looks like a PSP game
[2:14:45] <$IzazaOzihaha> No need to 100%. Just level it to 10, which is a fraction of all that.
[2:14:46] <+albertomtc> go to the professor
[2:14:46] <%ShinobiPhoenix> dont' worry aobut the number
[2:14:49] <%WeLucklessJacks> BETTER GET STARTED
[2:14:49] <valstriam> 10 points needed only
[2:14:50] <%oda_flobunaga> Its Pat, he has to
[2:14:51] <fuji_n2> you don't need to 100% now tho
[2:14:51] <+Manband20> "Gotta catch em all 25 times"
[2:14:52] <+kimbosegg> you only need to earn 10 points
[2:14:54] <+nochejunior> it's fine lol
[2:14:54] <Zayasu> @PatStaresAt you only need 10 points
[2:14:55] <+chant3r> no one of those is a achievement
[2:14:55] <+Complete_Phased> @PatStaresAt to complete an entry you only need to do 10 of the objectives per pokemon
[2:14:55] <%Dylveryn> No you just have to get ten points total, not fill ALL that in
[2:14:56] <%TheBensonator_> That's all 100% completion stuff
[2:14:56] <+Stormzcales_Lair> Like i just did Shinx Quick attack mirror match
[2:14:57] <TheDeimion> Like I said LUL welcome to pokemon statistics consensus collection
[2:14:57] <thelonechris> Pat with a goatee just looks wrong to me
[2:14:58] <%Birdigalore> @PatStaresAt You only have to complete a few of the tasks in order to get a 10 rank on a pokemon
[2:14:58] <%Tearonex> @PatStaresAt  you get rewards for releasing pokemon
[2:14:58] <rysku> you just need 10 points
[2:15:00] <steve_the_suus> evolve 3!
[2:15:02] <teefpal> You dont need to 100%
[2:15:02] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Oh god yeah it's a PSP game lol
[2:15:04] <%GallowsDrop> The Research points are misleading as hell you don't actually have to catch 25 Shinxs
[2:15:06] <+polothegreatest> Gotta grind for candies woolieKICKDAD
[2:15:08] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt You only need 10 total pips
[2:15:10] <OpenYourEels4TheNextFeels> ... I don't think it looks that bad. I must just have really low standards.
[2:15:10] <SchroedingersFerret> It is important to remember that games can have bad graphics and still be good. The same is not true of gameplay.
[2:15:12] <+Fetrigon> process is... involved to say the least
[2:15:12] <+kimbosegg> you get points for doing one of them
[2:15:12] <+rhydwings> you dont have to do em 1 at a time
[2:15:14] <AxelCezar> microgrind? holy shit fuck that
[2:15:17] <+kewlmyc> They really mean Gotta Catch Em All this time
[2:15:18] <nomolomo> mind goblin time
[2:15:19] <%Birdigalore> Completing everything is for psycho completionists who shiny hunt
[2:15:19] <+2DSuperiority> no goblins NOOO
[2:15:19] <JacknZack27> You only have to do ten of them
[2:15:20] <$Jaxnos> the unfinished tasks will break the Pat
[2:15:20] <Pookiedaexzile> "Artificial Difficulty"
[2:15:23] <$Pompadourius> LUL
[2:15:23] <reonome> GOBLIN
[2:15:23] <steve_the_suus> hungry
[2:15:25] <%RayReborne> research points per stage reached for any Mon? ok
[2:15:27] <TheDeimion> BUNCH THAT SHINX
[2:15:27] <%willyfreshness> this seems like a completionists  nightmare
[2:15:27] <+ReallyBigRocks> kill it with your bare hands
[2:15:28] <Demon_chann> oh shit
[2:15:28] <@QueequegTheater> psaGoblin
[2:15:29] <TheDeimion> *punch
[2:15:32] <+SilverDevilfish> Unfortunately Pat cannot catch his mind goblins in a Pokeball
[2:15:35] <Laecerelius> Sneaky archer Pregg got found!
[2:15:37] <%VentWilsn> KILL
[2:15:37] <Demon_chann> he was gonna KILL YOU
[2:15:37] <@QueequegTheater> CHEESE IT
[2:15:38] <%BinaryFireball> PECK ITS EYES OUT
[2:15:39] <TheDeimion> Uppercut it when it's not looking 4Head
[2:15:41] <TopTierHarley> it's not artificial difficulty, it's task lol
[2:15:42] <cpt_langosta> use the scraping spear
[2:15:43] <+Complete_Phased> Did he just use a flying type against a electric?
[2:15:44] <%BinaryFireball> oh... too aggresive?
[2:15:45] <+ReallyBigRocks> strangle that lightning cat
[2:15:45] <%CalderGaming> CalderGaming subscribed at Tier 2. They've subscribed for 30 months, currently on a 30 month streak! Greetings from your mind goblins. You have to catch 25 of every Pokemon. Do it. Do it, Orb.
[2:15:46] <%Dylveryn> @AxelCezar It's genuinely not as bad as that screen makes it look
[2:15:58] <TheDeimion> LUL Pat lol
[2:15:58] <+lukedu_> quick attack actually looks cool
[2:16:00] <%RetroCop87> Pat, your box covers up your health
[2:16:02] <+2DSuperiority> too low level to know an electric move
[2:16:04] <steve_the_suus> turn you into Berry!
[2:16:07] <TheDeimion> is this a no catch run LUL
[2:16:07] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @Pookiedaexzile that's literally not what that means... it's just a task through the whole game, you're not expecrted to do it right at teh start
[2:16:12] <TheDeimion> ayyy
[2:16:14] <+Shoosler> can you fuck the pok- i mean can you breed the pokem- i mean can you make the pokemon breed

[2:16:48] <Alt_Tab_streams> I thought you played monster hunter!
[2:16:49] <SchroedingersFerret> I wish the pokemon ragdolled when they fainted.
[2:16:51] <%ShinobiPhoenix> don't use potions
[2:16:52] <%TeenyTelly> In your bag
[2:16:55] <JacknZack27> Bait
[2:16:56] <%ShinobiPhoenix> use berries
[2:16:59] <teefpal> If it wasn't for the resolution I would have thought this was 7th gen
[2:17:01] <TheDeimion> use all the potions
[2:17:02] <%ShinobiPhoenix> save potions for big heals
[2:17:04] <+TaurusOxford> ...why does bidoof already have 68 HP???
[2:17:09] <%twistedj3ster> wait, why don't they walk around with you?

[2:17:32] <@Velyndra> you have 5 pips now
[2:17:33] <%ShinobiPhoenix> 25 is 5 peps
[2:17:33] <menuMenyu> no

[2:17:34] <Mister_McDerp> no
[2:17:34] <valstriam> no
[2:17:36] <%notsoy> no, each bubble is a point
[2:17:36] <$Bane_Kaikyo> what the fuck pat?
[2:17:36] <sheepysenka> that'd count as 15
[2:17:36] <+Stormzcales_Lair> @PatStaresAt Just do a Shinx Quick attack mirror match
[2:17:37] <+Rofiarf> 9*
[2:17:37] <%Treuan> You have five now

[2:17:38] <fuji_n2> 10 between  multiples pokes
[2:17:39] <Profmcstevie> any 10 pips
[2:17:40] <+nochejunior> i feel like Monster Hunter stories is better than Pokemon these days
[2:17:41] <SixthShinx> YOu have to cash them in with Laventon to get the levels @PatStaresAt
[2:17:42] <%notsoy> so catching 6 is worth 3 points
[2:17:43] <@Spydurman> @twistedj3ster the game can barely handle trees let alone a bunch of tracking pokemon LUL
[2:17:44] <+Rofiarf> the numbers on the side

[2:17:45] <%solracc25> some count double
[2:17:46] <knight_verse> Complaints that it's a game for kids, proceeds to not know how to use the menu... good job Pat. Kappa
[2:17:47] <%BinaryFireball> arithmetic mostly
[2:17:47] <%MechArch> pip pip
[2:17:48] <+albertomtc> nope doing only like the first 2 of eack one should be enough
[2:17:49] <steve_the_suus> 4+3+1?
[2:17:49] <JacknZack27> You have five pips right now
[2:17:50] <+Complete_Phased> every tier of a line is a level
[2:17:50] <valstriam> just add the numbers
[2:17:50] <rysku> add up the numbers on the left of the pips
[2:17:51] <ToneBacas> how do you read this?
[2:17:51] <@Spydurman> 12 pips
[2:17:52] <+albertomtc> and not even taht
[2:17:52] <%ShinobiPhoenix> you only need one of each CATEGORY
[2:17:53] <+Pachi3000> But you don't get them until you turn them in
[2:17:53] <TheDeimion> oh the green/yellow squaers ar pips
[2:17:53] <+2DSuperiority> green square number

[2:17:56] <%TheHateFish> 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3
[2:17:57] <TheDeimion> *squares are
[2:17:59] <%andrewofbob> Fill the squares, @PatStaresAt
[2:17:59] <+Pachi3000> You have to talk to the professor to 'get' them
[2:17:59] <Mattais88> each pip is worth its number?
[2:18:00] <@Spydurman> 69 pips
[2:18:01] <tall_tale> a red arrow is worth two
[2:18:01] <ReiDuran> look at the numbers on the left.
[2:18:02] <hydragoon513> Missions with the arrows give two for each.
[2:18:03] <+kewlmyc> Holy fucking MATH, Pat
[2:18:04] <+Stormzcales_Lair> Quick attack Mirror match
[2:18:06] <+ALazo> I don't think chat knows
[2:18:08] <Cynical_Canadian> I finally get it, each one highlighted equals a pip
[2:18:08] <SixthShinx> You have to check in with Laventon to get the levels @PatStaresAt
[2:18:12] <teefpal> Yes
[2:18:13] <Blank9> add the numbers on the left
[2:18:14] <+Das_Prints> To complete an entry to just meet to complete 10 different t pips.
[2:18:15] <%TheHateFish> Add the numbers
[2:18:15] <$Bane_Kaikyo> NOOOOO
[2:18:15] <%Cn_alpha_02> Red pips worth 2x
[2:18:16] <%Birdigalore> @PatStaresAt Just do the things and you'll see eventually
[2:18:16] <Daniel_Is_I> This seems overly complicated for no reason
[2:18:16] <+Rofiarf> hand it in to the professor at the camp
[2:18:17] <Alt_Tab_streams> Count
[2:18:17] <TopTierHarley> catch 3 for 3 points
[2:18:19] <+Complete_Phased> Each pip is worth 1 level
[2:18:20] <+CptCreampuff16> add up the numbers on the left
[2:18:20] <vingadivo> do basic math withe numbers in the green squares pat
[2:18:20] <+Shoosler> patmath
[2:18:20] <+chant3r> 10 pips mean its complete
[2:18:22] <%ShinobiPhoenix> each YELLOW BLOCK is a pip
[2:18:22] <steve_the_suus> pffft Pokemon can't count
[2:18:23] <%Delenay> add the number of your accomplishments up
[2:18:23] <Alt_Tab_streams> COUNT the numbers
[2:18:23] <teefpal> So you have 8 pips
[2:18:23] <+vdalson> chat saying 3 different things LUL
[2:18:25] <%cade_calrayn> each green square is worth its number
[2:18:25] <%TheLemuroid> Just catch another and see what happens
[2:18:25] <fuji_n2> his being dense on purpose
[2:18:25] <kookaburragangwar> Each pip adds its number instead of adding the difference
[2:18:26] <+Complete_Phased> at level 10 you complete an entry
[2:18:26] <gslayer14> this game is for children
[2:18:27] <+CptCreampuff16> those are your points
[2:18:27] <Cynical_Canadian> So 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3
[2:18:27] <valstriam> yes so after catching 2 more, you have 11 points already
[2:18:28] <Vileosis> just add the numbers Pat
[2:18:28] <+Catpurnicus> pip pip motherfucker
[2:18:28] <KingSwansJamboree> add up the green numbers
[2:18:30] <@Velyndra> @PatStaresAt red pips are worth 2, others 1
[2:18:30] <TopTierHarley> It's very clear
[2:18:32] <%VentWilsn> NOW IM CONFUSED
[2:18:33] <%legendfather_of_giants> its super clear
[2:18:34] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> This game is for babies
[2:18:34] <Alt_Tab_streams> you need to count the numbers!
[2:18:35] <cpt_langosta> pip is worthless, only use merry
[2:18:35] <rysku> it'll explain it in a bit
[2:18:37] <%RetroCop87> Pat hurts himself in his confusion
[2:18:38] <%BinaryFireball> the left column shows your total pips per row. you had 3+4+1 = 8
[2:18:40] <Pookiedaexzile> Don't Listen to Chat Pat, they don't want your Pips up
[2:18:42] <@QueequegTheater> Chat if you don't actually know please stop trying to guess
[2:18:43] <Mister_McDerp> game for children too unclear
[2:18:43] <+TaurusOxford> @Daniel_Is_I This is what happens when you don't get proper dev time to make a game.
[2:18:44] <$Jaxnos> each task has levels that corresponds to the number of points its worth
[2:18:44] <KyberNasse> This is how you lure goblins
[2:18:45] <%TheHateFish> 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 8/10
[2:18:45] <+Rofiarf> go to the professor
[2:18:45] <teefpal> two times
[2:18:46] <+DevinMayCry> What is everyone saying. Lot of misinfo in this
[2:18:47] <gslayer14> FRODO
[2:18:47] <+Pachi3000> chat what are you saying about RED
[2:18:49] <+Shoosler> shoulda picked piplup as your starter... js
[2:18:50] <+ReallyBigRocks> keep giving information, it definitely won't confuse him more
[2:18:52] <%Birdigalore> Just play game.  You're still in the tutorial
[2:18:53] <ShadeTheNovice> Chat please dont confuse the Pat by saying too many answers
[2:18:54] <%ShinobiPhoenix> yes you have 11 PIPS
[2:18:55] <Madinki> "I can't......i don't......under.....wha....?"
[2:18:55] <%notsoy> each bubble that represents a benchmark is worth one point
[2:18:58] <%코코꾸라> That's just number of tasks
[2:18:58] <JacknZack27> Just do the tutorial. It’ll explain
[2:18:59] <Pookiedaexzile> Its like the Mass Effect 2 Stat screen
[2:18:59] <teefpal> Those are tasks
[2:19:00] <+Pachi3000> that's 11 total pips, not how much they're worth
[2:19:00] <+Complete_Phased> 11 total unreported
[2:19:02] <+Rofiarf> talk to the professor
[2:19:03] <+chant3r> its spread between the pokemon
[2:19:03] <%cade_calrayn> that's the number of tasks you've completed for all of the Pokemon
[2:19:06] <%marvel877> MINDGOBLINS AT WORK AGAIN
[2:19:06] <Dunmarkh> BUT BABA
[2:19:09] <+TaurusOxford> @Shoosler piplup doesn't exist. LUL
[2:19:10] <%ShinobiPhoenix> it's just tasks
[2:19:10] <%hairtoday> you get a check mark for each one you complete, like catching one or three, each check mark is a point
[2:19:11] <SixthShinx> Those are sidequests
[2:19:11] <+nochejunior> Chat lying like usual LUL LUL
[2:19:11] <Cynical_Canadian> Oh boy
[2:19:13] <%notsoy> so for example, catching 25 shinx is the 5th of 5 tasks
[2:19:13] <%Birdigalore> This whole first zone is the tutorial
[2:19:14] <+Zix_Serro> Just go find Akari and do the tutorial.
[2:19:15] <+ReallyBigRocks> just let the game explain it, chat is gonna break your brain
[2:19:16] <+Pachi3000> You can't yet, have to complete the quest
[2:19:17] <+Rofiarf> oh you have to progress the story

[2:22:31] <Pookiedaexzile> Don't Worry they removed PVP from the game : ITS A FEATURE
[2:22:31] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> @CanadianAnimatorGuy Yeah they are
[2:22:31] <+Stormzcales_Lair> Neutral
[2:22:31] <sheepysenka> he can't even press A he's so mad
[2:22:33] <+TaurusOxford> neutral nature
[2:22:33] <+Das_Prints> There’s items later that let you change natures.
[2:22:36] <knight_verse> Apparently the tutorial is too tough for Pat. Kappa
[2:22:38] <TopTierHarley> Arrows PAt
[2:22:38] <+Pachi3000> use your words, pat
[2:22:38] <+SolidusRex> Arrows

[2:22:41] <+SolidusRex> Blue and red arrows
[2:22:41] <+Complete_Phased> the arrows on stats
[2:22:42] <+Sacredsunder> Stupid sexy bidoof
[2:22:43] <%notsoy> some natures are neutral
[2:22:45] <%hairtoday> look at the arrows, no arrows means neutral nature
[2:22:45] <Finaldragoon> ARROWS
[2:22:46] <+TaurusOxford> quirky is neutral nature
[2:22:47] <Daniel_Is_I> The arrows on the stats
[2:22:48] <+nochejunior> that bidoof sound is killing me
[2:22:48] <+Shoosler> is pat on the edibles again?
[2:22:49] <+Zix_Serro> Up & Down arrows on stats are what the nature does.
[2:22:50] <Demon_chann> quirky bidoof
[2:22:50] <Cynical_Canadian> That sound effect
[2:22:51] <Dunmarkh> ARROWS
[2:22:52] <%ShinobiPhoenix> how do you know how big it is?  the weight?
[2:22:55] <%Birdigalore> psaBlind psaBlind
[2:22:55] <%Nobrev> the up and down arrows on the stats are what the nature is affecting
[2:22:55] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> s p r e a d s h e e t s
[2:22:57] <KingSwansJamboree> the arrows
[2:22:57] <+Pachi3000> red means go up blue means go down
[2:22:57] <%VentWilsn> i could unironically listen to bidoof's cry all day
[2:22:58] <Vileosis> the arrows pat
[2:23:00] <JacknZack27> Are natures another one of his mind goblins or something?
[2:23:00] <+kewlmyc> Bidoof sounds so stupid. I love it so much.
[2:23:03] <$Pompadourius> GOBLIN ATTACK
[2:23:06] <Blank9> arrows up or down in one area, or none is neutral
[2:23:06] <Cynical_Canadian> bork
[2:23:09] <TheDeimion> welp I'm off, have fun consensus collecting , pat 4Head
[2:23:09] <+Zix_Serro> It doesn't matter, though. No PVP, so what does it matter?
[2:23:10] <+Pachi3000> that's how it work
[2:23:10] <Daniel_Is_I> Most natures are trash
[2:23:10] <Parapattern> GOOTS
[2:23:10] <TopTierHarley> NATURES DONT MATTER
[2:23:12] <quietshun> They don't matter
[2:23:12] <+SolidusRex> Quirky Bidoof is my porn name
[2:23:13] <+Fetrigon> ⬆️⬇️
[2:23:14] <+ReallyBigRocks> good thing it's not important at all
[2:23:14] <+Stormzcales_Lair> No Rowlets is fine
[2:23:14] <+chant3r> dont worry about it for now
[2:23:16] <Alt_Tab_streams> I hate to be condescending but I've met 12 year olds that have a hang on this.
[2:23:17] <@QueequegTheater> WHY IS BLUE BAD AND RED GOOD
[2:23:19] <roguemephilesclone> YOU DON'T NEED THIS MECHANIC, IGNORE IT.
[2:23:20] <Cynical_Canadian> Sacrifice them to the gods then
[2:23:20] <%optimasmaximas> @PatStaresAt some natures literally dont affect stats, they just exist
[2:23:20] <@QueequegTheater> HATE IT
[2:23:23] <KingSwansJamboree> baby game too hard for pat /j
[2:23:24] <%crimsonharvest> yeah how much of a delta does the nature give growth? from like A to low A?
[2:23:24] <Dunmarkh> @TopTierHarley YES THEY DO
[2:23:24] <@goose_attack_almanac> shix nature good though
[2:23:25] <CatRidder> gieff hates it too
[2:23:25] <%Birdigalore> I'm really glad we voted for Pat to play this xD
[2:23:26] <DanThePumpkinman> YOU DON'T NEED TO WORRY ABOUT NATURES THERES NO PVP
[2:23:26] <%JamesCorck> Pat don't over-think it, Natures don't matter.
[2:23:26] <+ReallyBigRocks> don't worry about it ever
[2:23:26] <+meteor530> Goddamn this game looks unimpressive
[2:23:29] <%marvel877> You could've been playing Bloodstained, Pat.
[2:23:31] <GrandmasterBFunk> @DevinMayCry The numbers next to the stats in the circle is EV's
[2:23:33] <ItsTheLos> Bidoof Gang! 🦫
[2:23:34] <%Agami23> isnt shinx gonna do special attack stuff? because electric?
[2:23:35] <ShadeTheNovice> Natures dont matter literally dont think about it
[2:23:35] <%BinaryFireball> @QueequegTheater is it really? fuckkkk
[2:23:37] <cpt_langosta> you know you can go defeat ganon right now, right? it's hard, but possible.
[2:23:37] <knight_verse> @queequegtheater Because Japan
[2:23:37] <+TaurusOxford> Pat, you're not poopsocking world championships. Natures make NO difference for casual playthroughs.
[2:23:38] <Doodicus110> Nothing matters in this game Sadge
[2:23:40] <HotMafia81> What are the numbers next to the stats?
[2:23:43] <Ghostduck01> Pat overthinking
[2:23:43] <+YoSoyConando89> My Rowlet had a good nature
[2:23:47] <@QueequegTheater> @TopTierHarley Natures are like a 15% buff/debuf, they actually do matter
[2:23:47] <Cynical_Canadian> You could be playing more FF14
[2:23:48] <JacknZack27> What does nature even matter? I’ve never paid attention to it
[2:23:50] <$Pompadourius> Blue bad red good
[2:23:53] <+tempestzephyr> You dont need to care about natures for casual play
[2:24:03] <+TaurusOxford> @Agami23 No, his best stat is physical
[2:24:05] <Daniel_Is_I> Natures don't matter outside of competitivew
[2:24:05] <Pookiedaexzile> Gold best
[2:24:06] <+DevinMayCry> @GrandmasterBFunk These are similar to EVs but are literally not EVs. They are a new thing you level and can max
[2:24:06] <Cynical_Canadian> Your throw game is weak child
[2:24:06] <%ShinobiPhoenix> wait until HEAVY BALLS
[2:24:11] <+ReallyBigRocks> NotLikeThis not playing a pokemon game 100% optimally
[2:24:17] <+Shoosler> lol MMO mobs have more patrol pathing than these wild animals
[2:24:17] <+SolidusRex> It's a single player only game
[2:24:18] <+kewlmyc> Even if it looks like trash, I'm more willing to it a pass unlike Sword and Shield, because at least this is doing something new.
[2:24:23] <TopTierHarley> @QueequegTheater They don't matter in this game
[2:24:23] <$Pompadourius> Guys, this is Pat. "It doesn't matter" doesn't work on him, he wants it to be the BEST if it's an RPG. lol
[2:24:25] <+CptCreampuff16> help mind goblins are telling me to complete the pokedex for every pokemen
[2:24:27] <DXLelouch24> @QueequegTheater no shut up youll torment the Pat
[2:24:28] <+2DSuperiority> If it's anything like sword and shield you can change literally anything about your Mona stats
[2:24:34] <nomolomo> might be an unpopular opinion but i really dont like the pokemon's sound effects
[2:24:36] <+Das_Prints> @jacknzack27 it only matters in pvp and there are items in this game that let you change a persons nature. That being said there is no pvp in this game apparently.
[2:24:36] <%ShinobiPhoenix> heavy is really throws off your distance judding
[2:24:40] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> She teleported
[2:24:40] <DSD24> Woah the teleport
[2:24:43] <@QueequegTheater> @DXLelouch24 Why do you think I became a mod Kappa
[2:24:44] <GrandmasterBFunk> @DevinMayCry They are literally called EV's, it is the new system for EV's
[2:24:45] <JacknZack27> Rolling off cliffs is kinda fun
[2:24:48] <+Fetrigon> OMEGALUL
[2:24:50] <+polothegreatest> Wait they put lvl system of GO? woolieSPICE
[2:24:54] <$Jaxnos> yeah, up is red and down is blue. like the Yakuza.
[2:24:54] <gslayer14> may knows teleport?
[2:24:54] <+Das_Prints> Pokemon’s nature*
[2:25:00] <%ShinobiPhoenix> ok, the game doesn't tell you right away, but he wants one over 58lbs
[2:25:04] <TopTierHarley> May?
[2:25:06] <nesbitt22> Chat how many Pokemon can you hold at once?
[2:25:07] <%bevyrage> you can skyrim up rocks harder if you hold a ball in hand to throw it while rubbing up against 'em. makes it easier to just run up steep ledges, and you can dodge roll out of it for more distance/height traveled
[2:25:11] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Dawn
[2:25:12] <TopTierHarley> That's "Dawn"
[2:25:20] <+nochejunior> anyone knows if there are gyms in this game?
[2:25:24] <%BinaryFireball> am I high or wasnt pat's character blonde before?

[2:27:13] <%MyNameIsRasus> oh cool they tell you what's effective
[2:27:14] <+meteor530> @Th0ms0nStuart I guess but everything else looks so...underdeveloped.
[2:27:17] <+Shoosler> @QueequegTheater you're right I didn't consider the pkmn. hmm
[2:27:17] <Doodicus110> You know what? The game may look awful...but the gameplay looks pretty awesome. nemuNote
[2:27:24] <%ShinobiPhoenix> get to their backs during battle
[2:27:24] <Cynical_Canadian> The flat textures on everything is a yokes though
[2:27:27] <+Okashido> Wait, I didn't see the health bar of the pokemon. Can you not see those in this game?
[2:27:28] <+DevinMayCry> @GrandmasterBFunk Its a new system that replaces both and are eroneously called EVs cause they are similar. I didnt say they were changed cause its been replaced with a new system
[2:27:32] <TopTierHarley> See if it's bigger than 2'8
[2:27:34] <+Stormzcales_Lair> Very fun, just looks bad
[2:27:34] <$Pompadourius> Gameplay good, graphics bad seems to be the general consensus.
[2:27:35] <%ShinobiPhoenix> backstab counts

[2:29:28] <+shry7> its like botw but there's no item durability
[2:29:31] <$Pompadourius> TRUE
[2:29:35] <%ShinobiPhoenix> you NEED ITEMS, LOTS OF THEM
[2:29:37] <KingSwansJamboree> ooo it gives xp
[2:29:37] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[2:29:38] <Demon_chann> i hope they keep it
[2:29:39] <+ReallyBigRocks> yeah i feel the same way about it
[2:29:40] <NickHatesSnow> Gen 5 forever
[2:29:41] <%Anime_Flux> at least it's not motion controls
[2:29:41] <teefpal> The first actual change, really
[2:29:43] <Laecerelius> Wow they even get exp for it
[2:29:46] <%TeenyTelly> Hold ZL to lock on to a wild Pokémon and throw a poke ball @patstaresat
[2:29:46] <$Pompadourius> LUL
[2:29:50] <+polothegreatest> Thats a better HM
[2:29:50] <%topendbuzza> ugly as
[2:29:53] <skagtheprinceofhell> I dont understand what people mean by visually bad. Looks good.
[2:29:53] <%sporeian94> GEN 3 FOREVER
[2:29:54] <+TaurusOxford> LUL
[2:30:01] <teefpal> Gen 5 was the bomb
[2:30:05] <NickHatesSnow> It's not even a change it's still a spinoff
[2:30:05] <%KingKario> Ok thx. I'll just wait til Nintendo releases Switch Pro with BotW 2 this fall.
[2:30:05] <@QueequegTheater> It looks fine IMO
[2:30:05] <%SaiyanShoto> But Paige loves to jump into garbage
[2:30:09] <emper0rner0> Would y'all say this looks like a Wii game or a Wii U game?
[2:30:09] <%MyNameIsRasus> CRAZY TALK
[2:30:09] <+Shoosler> a step in the right direction at least. everyone has wanted a 3D open world pokemon game since like 2001
[2:30:10] <+TaurusOxford> HAHAHA
[2:30:13] <+Das_Prints> @nochejunior it definitely looks cool from the few I’ve seen.  Not sure if he gets to one this stream but we’ll see.
[2:30:14] <DanThePumpkinman> @primaldweeb theres heaps of music pat might need to turn it up
[2:30:15] <+meteor530> GEN 1 and 2 beats all
[2:30:15] <Mister_McDerp> gameplay over graphics
[2:30:20] <@QueequegTheater> Jebaited
[2:30:31] <+TaurusOxford> @emper0rner0 PS2 game.
[2:30:32] <%crimsonharvest> can you turf stomp that pokeyman
[2:30:33] <%TerpanderLux> its dead
[2:30:35] <+Zix_Serro> Now imagine if they took this engine and took a full year or two to make it look really nice. That's the hope for Gen 9.
[2:30:37] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> It'd be cool to have these abilities in an area that isn't empty nothing. Like a route from a real Pokemon game
[2:30:40] <quietshun> @emper0rner0 xenoblade  x was on wii u
[2:30:44] <%TerpanderLux> WUMPLE
[2:30:48] <+kewlmyc> It fainted.... out of existence
[2:30:49] <+Manband20> Wumple
[2:30:51] <Pookiedaexzile> "gameplay over Graphics" for a Billion dollar franchise
[2:30:51] <%ShinobiPhoenix> you can switch items the sme way and throw balls at it DURING BATTLE
[2:30:55] <+Complete_Phased> Press Y to see turn order
[2:30:58] <%D00msDayDan> the way you can walk around while the pokemon fight each other makes me wish it was more dynamic like yakuza 7
[2:31:00] <Demon_chann> woah
[2:31:02] <%MegadBlitz> press Y for turn order
[2:31:05] <emper0rner0> @quietshun So was Devil's Third LUL
[2:31:06] <%willyfreshness> Would you still love Paige if she was a Wurmple?
[2:31:06] <Demon_chann> i didnt knew that
[2:31:06] <%ShinobiPhoenix> backstab Mons in battle
[2:31:08] <%chance_h> Choke them out!
[2:31:12] <KyberNasse> Next Pokemon game should make it so that the wild Pokemon near you could join the fight
[2:31:14] <sulkcessor> elmooo
[2:31:17] <+Das_Prints> Funny change but Pokémon get stat boosts every time they break out of a ball during battle.
[2:31:18] <skagtheprinceofhell> The gameplay isnt any different though. The only real difference isnt actually the gameplay but you can keep moves and just change them out.
[2:31:21] <ReiDuran> you can press Y for turn order like in FF10
[2:31:23] <%BinaryFireball> you can finally die in a pokemon game
[2:31:24] <HotMafia81> Wumple
[2:31:35] <+PrimalDweeb> Ah, so there's only music for the fights... But the open world is limited to ambient sounds.
[2:31:36] <rysku> @KyberNasse that's a thing in this game kinda
[2:31:36] <%TerpanderLux> its almost a video game now
[2:31:38] <+toomuchsnarf> punt that pokemon
[2:31:40] <+Das_Prints> @kybernasse You can get jumped by multiple wild Pokémon at once in this game apparently.
[2:31:41] <Vileosis> @emper0rner0 @TaurusOxford lol you clearly didn't play a ps2 game if you think it looked this good
[2:31:42] <%crimsonharvest> not having a billion fucking textboxes constantly is so weird
[2:31:43] <%topendbuzza> u.g.l.y
[2:31:45] <+meteor530> Everything looks so fuckin bad
[2:31:48] <%Anime_Flux> yep
[2:31:50] <Daniel_Is_I> It looks worse than Wii U games
[2:31:50] <KyberNasse> Oh neat
[2:31:51] <$Pompadourius> I wouldn't mind if the next game was like this but with multiplayer and better graphics.
[2:31:51] <cpt_langosta> sublivion
[2:31:51] <$Solid_Stro> Do a tablehopper like Vergil
[2:31:51] <%chance_h> Is this the dark souls of Pokémon?
[2:31:52] <+MoonObscure> looks so bad
[2:31:53] <ahaegotrigger> True
[2:31:53] <%oda_flobunaga> Eeeeeeeeewwwwwww
[2:31:53] <Shwepie> @KyberNasse Kind of exists in this game. You can fight multiple wild pokemon at once.
[2:31:54] <+kewlmyc> oblivion looks way better honestly
[2:31:54] <%bevyrage> one thing i really like about this game is there's no gimmick to be the 'big change', the entire game is changed enough to not require a shitty gimmick
[2:31:54] <wqorst> did paige get her glasses yet
[2:31:55] <GarbageQueenEllie> Yeah blivion
[2:31:55] <%ErikFeral> I just joined, and this looks exactly like a Breath of the PokeMon.
[2:31:56] <$Pompadourius> Genuine positive gameplay changes.
[2:31:56] <%ataxia72> I dont think it looks that bad tbh
[2:31:59] <+PrimalDweeb> Yeah, that's really ugly.
[2:32:00] <DancesWitBalrog> is rolling faster than running? @patstaresat
[2:32:00] <Mister_McDerp> its okay
[2:32:01] <+Shoosler> a beautiful oblivion.
[2:32:01] <+Manband20> At least Oblivion was held back by the technology of the time
[2:32:01] <+TopTieramisu> sublivion, even
[2:32:02] <skagtheprinceofhell> ...It looks good though.
[2:32:02] <+Okashido> Does he mean framerate or graphics?
[2:32:03] <%greasypete00> there are so many games that just beg for a higher powered switch and nintendo refuses
[2:32:04] <baxterd> when ya zoom out and do away w all the dramatic angles and dress up, these early poke battles look really chintzy
[2:32:04] <chai_wolf> Ah so then no problem at all then
[2:32:05] <%BinaryFireball> wonder if it was designed for mobile
[2:32:05] <%sporeian94> Nintendosarus refuses to have good hardware
[2:32:06] <+DevinMayCry> "And thats that" Shows pretty sunset colors
[2:32:06] <%notsoy> when has a pokemon game ever had above average graphics?
[2:32:09] <Nkmucci> just hopping in, do you like the gameplay?
[2:32:09] <Calamity2007> Sub oblivion? This is Sub Morrowind
[2:32:10] <roguemephilesclone> Nooooo iiiiiit's nooooooot. It's sub Skyrim.
[2:32:12] <+nochejunior> we could have dungeons instead of gyms in the next game, that'll be sick
[2:32:12] <chai_wolf> cause it looks fine lol
[2:32:14] <$Jaxnos> i wonder if i can pop this on my pc and get it to just populate everything at once
[2:32:14] <%Tearonex> Pat still hasn't seen the Apex LUL
[2:32:15] <StampedingTurtle> 19 raiders from StampedingTurtle have joined!
[2:32:17] <+NobuuNobuu> cmon it's not that bad
[2:32:18] <%Valdorick> That is NOT sub Oblivion, stop playing games with fan texture mods
[2:32:19] <ahaegotrigger> good gameplay pre 2006 Graphics
[2:32:19] <+TaurusOxford> @emper0rner0 some of these textures and effects are definitely PS2-era.
[2:32:20] <+DevinMayCry> The models were redone or something I guess
[2:32:22] <grotliquor> apparently forgot what oblivion looks like
[2:32:23] <%karovus> we cant all look better than oblivion i guess
[2:32:25] <TopTierHarley> Can't believe Nintendo invented Open World grassland games
[2:32:25] <KyberNasse> Game Freak and 3D LUL
[2:32:26] <+DevinMayCry> Like the mons
[2:32:27] <+tomdwarf> Yeah, Im happy with these changes, I hope they build off of them and make more "Legends" games.
[2:32:27] <roguemephilesclone> Which is still ugly, of course.
[2:32:27] <@Ranryu692> welcome raiders!
[2:32:28] <Eppielicious> just joined up, is it my audio or is the sound just really bad?
[2:32:29] <+Shoosler> @Calamity2007 that's true
[2:32:29] <aliasz50> saying it's sub oblivion may be too much tho
[2:32:31] <+sugarfreemixup> it should be way better but it looks fine
[2:32:31] <+polothegreatest> zelda was better on the same console woolieGASM
[2:32:32] <%bevyrage> @notsoy back when they ran on 2D sprites
[2:32:33] <Cynical_Canadian> What do you mean, this is the best looking Dreamcast game I've ever seen!
[2:32:33] <Togamdiron> @sporeian94 It's not a hardware issue. The Switch can run Doom 2016.
[2:32:33] <%sporeian94> I don't like the lack of variety of pokemon
[2:32:34] <+Das_Prints> This definitely seems like an interesting foundation if they actually stick with this structure and build on it. We’ll see though.
[2:32:37] <+Stormzcales_Lair> Evolve one tho
[2:32:38] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Pat, have you ever even played Oblivion without mods
[2:32:39] <%BinaryFireball> @notsoy  its not about above average. its about getting half way to average
[2:32:41] <+kewlmyc> No, go all Bidoofs
[2:32:43] <+Okashido> I'll admit it has a much more muted color palette. Everything seems pretty fog colored.
[2:32:43] <@Ranryu692> @PatStaresAt you've been raided by @StampedingTurtle
[2:32:44] <Th0ms0nStuart> you do not remember what morrowind looks like if you think is sub THAT
[2:32:44] <AtticusofBronne> Hey all
[2:32:45] <skagtheprinceofhell> Okay, you people forgot what Oblivion or Morrowind looks like
[2:32:45] <$IzazaOzihaha> Fast travel via map.
[2:32:46] <%marvel877> @notsoy when they outsourced to other devs, like Namco Bandai for Pokken and New Pokemon Snap.
[2:32:46] <TopTierHarley> @sporeian94 it's the start of the game
[2:32:47] <+meteor530> Throw em in the river let em drown
[2:32:49] <+yoshkosh20> Die monster, you don't belong in this world.
[2:32:49] <artoflec> the specular effecto n the rocks looks like shit, it looks like its snowed on but its just supposed to be light.
[2:32:51] <AtticusofBronne> How’s the game
[2:32:54] <%Nekros4442> @sporeian94 It's just the starting zone
[2:32:55] <+Based_Moose> Pat there's ponyta down by the river
[2:32:56] <%legendfather_of_giants> this is NOT sub Oblivion
[2:33:02] <mrethanclifford> love all the straight up lifted BOTW sound clips
[2:33:06] <+yoshkosh20> oh shit. can you cook?
[2:33:07] <+DevinMayCry> If this looked like oblivion it be worse off. Not that its not real bad textures and quality
[2:33:08] <Vileosis> if they increased the draw distance it would be fine tbh, but the nothingness you can see is kinda lame
[2:33:10] <Daniel_Is_I> Literally everyone I've seen play this game has said "Man the NEXT one of these is gonna actually be good!"
[2:33:12] <%Birdigalore> @PatStaresAt This is the PC
[2:33:12] <%crimsonharvest> like a herd of adamantoise fuckin goin ham
[2:33:13] <StampedingTurtle> Of course Pat! Love your streams, hope my peeps like ya too!
[2:33:17] <+Complete_Phased> to revive them you need to rest
[2:33:19] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Backstab Mons during battle by throwing balls at them while they are distracted by the fight, backstab "catches" count
[2:33:20] <%greasypete00> pc in time with no computers
[2:33:24] <baxterd> I'd like a survival sim built out of this or something
[2:33:28] <+Stormzcales_Lair> Moveset change is So good
[2:33:28] <+polothegreatest> Hate pokken is not below 50 dls
[2:33:28] <TopTierHarley> It's always been like this
[2:33:36] <yaboi_raidshadowlegends> i don't understand why nintendo won't port these games to pc, they'd sell another 5 million at least
[2:33:36] <$Jaxnos> if you press Y, you can move them more seamlessly
[2:33:37] <+Manband20> Wumple
[2:33:37] <$IzazaOzihaha> Press Y to simply select a pokemon and then move it.
[2:33:44] <%willyfreshness> Wurmpulssy
[2:33:45] <zerointelligence000> so how have Pat's first impressions been so far? is this pokemans worth it?
[2:33:49] <Eppielicious> the pokemon management is garbage. all my pastures are full and its messin with my goblins bc theres not sort by pokemon button
[2:33:52] <@QueequegTheater> Trade in our dead Starly
[2:33:55] <@QueequegTheater> *your
[2:33:57] <$Pompadourius> @zerointelligence000 Gameplay good, graphics bad
[2:34:00] <%crimsonharvest> i hope Palworld is real and you get to assign those surplus mons to the sweatshop
[2:34:01] <yukichocomilk> @yaboi_raidshadowlegends bc they're apple of video games
[2:34:03] <+Shoosler> @mrethanclifford oh yeah I can hear it now. lots of the menus noises sound like botw
[2:34:06] <+TaurusOxford> @zerointelligence000 He likes the changes - thinks game is ugly as fuck though
[2:34:07] <cpt_langosta> protip: you can spank bidoof. it likes it.
[2:34:08] <+DevinMayCry> Hes not dead anymore Quuqueq
[2:34:16] <DSD24> Never been done before
[2:34:18] <%Anime_Flux> I seen it
[2:34:23] <TopTierHarley> Finish th emission Pat
[2:34:26] <gslayer14> zoop
[2:34:33] <@QueequegTheater> I didn't see anything
[2:34:33] <+Okashido> The professor looks like such a dweeb.
[2:34:36] <$Solid_Stro> Zangief used bark, it wasn’t effective
[2:34:40] <%VentWilsn> thats more pokemon in a team than anyone from the village, congrats
[2:34:42] <$Pompadourius> Some of these sound like BotW sound effects
[2:34:43] <+PrimalDweeb> Damn, those trees are fucked.
[2:34:44] <JacknZack27> Gotta finish the tutorial
[2:34:45] <cavefishes> so is this ze fun game or ze unfun game
[2:34:47] <+Stormzcales_Lair> Pokemon can grab leeks too
[2:34:47] <%ShinobiPhoenix> you can check controls in options
[2:34:47] <%VentWilsn> psaBlind psaBlind psaBlind
[2:34:49] <mor3gan> what makes this not just BOTW but pokemon
[2:34:52] <%Wallabri> psaBork
[2:34:53] <sheepysenka> those dark green trees look upside down
[2:34:57] <%notsoy> being able to adjust your pokemon order without going into menus is somehow one of the best things this has done
[2:35:00] <Vileosis> Those trees were a choice for sure
[2:35:04] <%ShinobiPhoenix> yes
[2:35:06] <%TerpanderLux> kill him
[2:35:06] <+sermittens> @PatStaresAt  when do you face the cleric beast?
[2:35:09] <%ShinobiPhoenix> that's teh point
[2:35:12] <$Jaxnos> you made a fren
[2:35:15] <DSD24> So cute
[2:35:16] <Shwepie> @mor3gan Missing all the stuff that made BotW good.
[2:35:16] <skagtheprinceofhell> @mor3gan You yourself cant attack the Pokemon and its turn based
[2:35:17] <nomolomo> it also feels like the environments and the characters just really clash in styles
[2:35:18] <@Ranryu692> @mor3gan the part where it's not open world or anything like BOTW in almost any way
[2:35:18] <ToneBacas> this whole scene reminds me of your intro video, Pat
[2:35:18] <KyberNasse> Pat install some immersive ENB mods :)
[2:35:20] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @cavefishes looks uggo but gameplay is prety dandy
[2:35:22] <HotMafia81> yeah those shadows are fucked
[2:35:23] <+DevinMayCry> What bothers me about the trees inst so much their look but that you can see the bottom of them sticking out on the ground not even to the ground. Like the roots are floating above the ground if theres even a slight incline
[2:35:24] <%cylish> How is it that these guys have infinite more money than the zelda team but cant do even something that good looking>
[2:35:25] <+MoonObscure> lol
[2:35:25] <+Shoosler> my volume is down but is there any music at all???
[2:35:26] <+PwnyB> Proper Execution, a giving a damn.
[2:35:27] <Eppielicious> I believe it counts evolving any type in the chain. so level 2->3 counts for all three levels
[2:35:36] <%TerpanderLux> now he sees
[2:35:36] <$Solid_Stro> Can I enslave you?
[2:35:47] <OkamiDude15> @mor3gan its zone based rather than being a large connected world
[2:35:49] <OpenYourEels4TheNextFeels> I think I'm just SUPER forgiving of environmental graphics compared to character models, because I don't really have a problem with this game's environment.
[2:35:49] <%BinaryFireball> ya'll are saying the gameplay looks good but idk it seems like its gonna be bland in an hour
[2:35:53] <+Stormzcales_Lair> Cuz anime and cards and bleh blah...
[2:35:56] <+Based_Moose> Big tough guy bullying literal worms
[2:35:58] <roguemephilesclone> You can catch them, but stealth is rewarded with a much higher catch rate.
[2:36:03] <%heyitsbrian> they need to learn how not to make games for handhelds
[2:36:04] <$Pompadourius> @BinaryFireball O ,eam. ot
[2:36:04] <grotliquor> I would rather they invest in voice over
[2:36:07] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @Shoosler most open world games don't do music now
[2:36:10] <FstSergeant8595> Oh look it's pseudo-Dawn
[2:36:12] <Virokwet> cool
[2:36:14] <Cynical_Canadian> @BinaryFireball that's my thoughts as well
[2:36:15] <Eppielicious> gameplay gets way better and changes battles a ton
[2:36:20] <EvergreenGiant> So what % of the visual nightmare is because of the dev and how much is the fault of the Switch
[2:36:21] <grotliquor> and it's more reasonable in the switch
[2:36:21] <tinytinykittycat> I think Id like pokemon better if you could just shoot the pokemon
[2:36:24] <skagtheprinceofhell> @binaryfireball Its just Pokemon gameplay. Nothing new there.
[2:36:24] <+Shoosler> Akari bout to catch a pipe amirite
[2:36:25] <KyberNasse> Ancient Dawn
[2:36:29] <ReiDuran> ehh, don't really care about voices
[2:36:33] <%ShinobiPhoenix> RANK UP!
[2:36:35] <%BinaryFireball> if you say @Eppielicious
[2:36:38] <skagtheprinceofhell> @evergreengiant All the devs.
[2:36:41] <+Shoosler> @ShinobiPhoenix :( ya hate to see it
[2:36:46] <%ShinobiPhoenix> BYE SHINIES
[2:36:53] <FstSergeant8595> @ShinobiPhoenix Tbh I prefer the ambience over music blasting in my ears constantly
[2:36:54] <%baka_sugoi> psaWink
[2:36:55] <%legendfather_of_giants> @EvergreenGiant 90/10, this thing plays DOOM
[2:36:55] <+ReallyBigRocks> @EvergreenGiant well there are lots of switch games that look and run better than this so I'd say it's on the devs

[2:39:25] <ToneBacas> LUL
[2:39:43] <%doc_ock_rokc> Zangief used Bark! Pat became frustrated
[2:39:46] <KyberNasse> "I'd like to see you try fucko"
[2:39:50] <%BinaryFireball> back to the pokeball with you gief!
[2:39:51] <Cynical_Canadian> Rules of nature?
[2:39:53] <Pookiedaexzile> Zangief used Roar
[2:39:54] <%Sotetsu> Dogs are like grandkids. They're fun to visit, but I wouldn't want to deal with them full time.
[2:39:56] <cpt_langosta> *offscreen real life pokemon battle ensues*
[2:39:58] <%Anime_Flux> Gief bout to SPD
[2:40:01] <%RayReborne> "Fucko this DAD"
[2:40:01] <NickHatesSnow> I hope the next mainline Pokemon is good so I can be excited for a Gen 5 remake
[2:40:02] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> that sounded way more threatening then it should've LUL
[2:40:03] <@PeachSaliva> stiinky baby
[2:40:06] <%XzileGaming> its now the zangief strem
[2:40:09] <%ShinobiPhoenix> the whole point of moving is oto move to a mon's back to hit him with a ball, position matters now
[2:40:09] <%oda_flobunaga> Yakuza style street brawler with controllable Pokemon, basically Poken fighter but open world
[2:40:09] <%twistedj3ster> Pat, control your Snubul
[2:40:11] <mattymcfilth> pats playing this?
[2:40:14] <StoicMoogle> Meanwhile, Elmo uses Rest. It was super effective!
[2:40:20] <ToneBacas> Gief can shrink at will to fit inside the house
[2:40:23] <IIVELIISCHPFULII> but which is the stinky baby
[2:40:26] <satiresatyr> he is a snubul
[2:40:27] <%BinaryFireball> ok your character should not make mouth sounds.... this unnerves me
[2:40:30] <Eppielicious> @ShinobiPhoenix back attacks work in battle?
[2:40:33] <JohnA83> I guess I need to get this. It looks real good
[2:40:33] <Cynical_Canadian> Damn he's gotten big

[2:40:43] <%doc_ock_rokc> @StoicMoogle Elmo used Encore
[2:40:43] <@PeachSaliva> He's mad because I fed Elmo and he can smell it.
[2:40:46] <+yoshkosh20> listen to that grumble.
[2:40:46] <roguemephilesclone> I know most people don't know how easy early Pokwmon in all games are to catch, but I feel like any tenuous feelings of that knowledge have completely drained from Pat.
[2:40:48] <%baka_sugoi> psaBig STINKY
[2:40:49] <@PeachSaliva> But otherwise, Elmo would be mad
[2:40:53] <Cynical_Canadian> Those textures man

[2:40:54] <lucasoptics> @StoicMoogle baby spams rest, its his only strat

[2:41:28] <%ShinobiPhoenix> some mons are ANNOYING if you don't Backstab them
[2:41:31] <%Bloomingzonda> Pat used butt snakcs it is very effective
[2:41:32] <%doc_ock_rokc> What is Zangief's types?
[2:41:39] <%Deft_Thought> I find Laventon's design upsetting

[2:42:21] <@PeachSaliva> @Sotetsu Elmo eats when he's hungry and he MUST eat when he's hungry. Zangief is on a specific timer. It's hard to match them up.
[2:42:23] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> It's like Chief Wiggum taunting those dogs
[2:42:23] <KyberNasse> Zangief is Fighting/Earth
[2:42:26] <Pookiedaexzile> He will not stand for such indignitiy
[2:42:35] <StoicMoogle> Dog got fucking owned

[2:46:25] <%twistedj3ster> I'm laughing at imagining Gief having to rotate like a tank
[2:46:25] <%oda_flobunaga> Just once, i'd like to see an M rated pokemon game

[2:47:04] <%VentWilsn> what do u think are the research tasks for Zangief?
[2:47:06] <%Birdigalore> Bork Busters!
[2:47:12] <Eppielicious> fall damage can be degated with the throw animations
[2:47:12] <lucasoptics> @Birdigalore More like Gief punching pat
[2:47:13] <Pookiedaexzile> Gief is over powering the small man
[2:47:14] <satiresatyr> gief is a whiny baby today. aww
[2:47:21] <%BinaryFireball> stream comes back its just zangief wearing pats clothes
[2:47:24] <lucasoptics> @Birdigalore Pup snuffers
[2:47:26] <+ReallyBigRocks> I hope this game gets emulated so you can absolutely crank the draw distance and change the color grading
[2:47:27] <%Sotetsu> @ventwilsn Give treat 1000 times.
[2:47:34] <KyberNasse> Pat is getting Body Slammed
[2:47:52] <%BinaryFireball> remember that anime when the principle fights a deer?
[2:47:54] <%ShinobiPhoenix> seriously though, the easiest points are ones from "seeing" a move
[2:47:55] <Pookiedaexzile> Zangief used Seismic Toss
[2:48:07] <Cynical_Canadian> Pat comes back, "I'm not posting that shit, I got wrekced"
[2:48:12] <%ShinobiPhoenix> seeing a move counts DOING a move or a move being used against you
[2:48:14] <cpt_langosta> I think Zangief is just angry with Pat for streaming this game when he COULD be playing the world-renowned Microsoft Bob.
[2:48:22] <Eppielicious> @ReallyBigRocks its already working great on emu, im really excited to see what the community comes up with in terms of mods

[2:55:27] <%oda_flobunaga> Voltorb?
[2:55:27] <%Sotetsu> Catch a Lopunny, they're hot.
[2:55:30] <Profmcstevie> Drifloon steals children, they are NOT best
[2:55:31] <%Ironbuttz> why so late if you don't mind me asking?  I've been trying to feed my boy a bit later so he doesn't barf first thing in the morning
[2:55:33] <big_oki> levitate

[2:55:41] <cpt_langosta> EAT THE GOVERNMENT CRAB
[2:55:42] <%DovaDude29> I have never seen a level 2 drifloon before, wut???
[2:55:46] <%ShinobiPhoenix> when Lv45 Snorlax is firing a HYPER BEAM AT YOU, you'll be happy to have a GHOST TYPE
[2:55:48] <@Velyndra> @Profmcstevie that sounds like a win to me
[2:55:53] <%DoomUnderTheStairs> I've been replaying Black & White recently and its still up there as a favorite
[2:56:02] <%ShinobiPhoenix> pause the game
[2:56:06] <blacksteelclash> oh wow this looks boring as shit
[2:56:08] <Pookiedaexzile> Drifloons are bad Ghost types
[2:56:22] <sheepysenka> taco bell ding attack
[2:56:22] <Eppielicious> actually caught him slippin
[2:56:31] <%TerpanderLux> die
[2:56:46] <+tomdwarf> I love his design, but yeah, drifloon/drifblim isnt great. It has some bulk tho, but other ghosts are better at even that.
[2:56:52] <Cynical_Canadian> Don't be sleepin
[2:56:54] <%Ironbuttz> I getcha.  Mine gets doggt heartburn, and can barf quite a bit
[2:57:04] <%TerpanderLux> thats ok. its good to kill.
[2:57:13] <tanarath> @shinobiphoenix As much as it'd be difficult, is because I'd have to build my own dev tools, import shit, and fix their shit, it would not be as easy as their team has it, due to: Them being the biggest game series in history, and thus having unlimited funds for talent & a quality engine etc. Wasn't there one indie that pat play that's JUST 2v2 pokemon?
[2:57:20] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @tomdwarf you say that but when uyou need a Ghost, and he's your option... you'll be happy to have him
[2:57:21] <%DoomUnderTheStairs> you can catch later keep grindin
[2:57:26] <%Cozy90> this is turning into a fster version of monster hunter
[2:57:32] <%TerpanderLux> Weasel 🪱
[2:57:33] <MeAuntieNora> my kitty thinks breakfast is at 3 AM if I don't feed dinner at 10, later ideally
[2:57:41] <%TamsynRRD> Tem Tem
[2:57:45] <+polothegreatest> nexomon?
[2:57:47] <GeneralHysterics> it's clearly a rat, not a weasel
[2:57:51] <fuji_n2> catching pokes also grinds tho, you get exp for everything in this game
[2:57:51] <+tomdwarf> @tomdwarf Oh absolutely, type advantage generally beats out ANY stat discussion
[2:57:57] <KyberNasse> Tem Tem sucked tho
[2:57:59] <FrostedZaibatsu> How do you feel about the story? lobosPizza
[2:58:05] <sheepysenka> can't be done
[2:58:08] <%DoomUnderTheStairs> my pittielab is always hungry
[2:58:11] <%DoomUnderTheStairs> ha
[2:58:13] <%TerpanderLux> the story is anus
[2:58:15] <Eppielicious> theres a story?
[2:58:21] <Cynical_Canadian> I wish Genius Sonority would make another Pokemon game
[2:58:24] <+ReallyBigRocks> Pat is still in the tutorial too
[2:58:25] <Mister_McDerp> story LUL
[2:58:27] <fuji_n2> it's mon hun kinda story, none of it matters
[2:58:27] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> I was transported to a faraway land, to a world where monsters rule
[2:58:28] <quietshun> Some pokemon ganes have stories
[2:58:28] <NickHatesSnow> some have stories\
[2:58:29] <%cooldude69xx> @tomdwarf Main game especially. Competitive gets weirder
[2:58:31] <%DoomUnderTheStairs> if you want a pokemon with story play black and white
[2:58:31] <%RaziWraith> People play pokemon for story?
[2:58:33] <Eppielicious> honestly, there could be, I mashed anyway
[2:58:34] <akitanito> LUL
[2:58:35] <%Tearonex> This one has a story
[2:58:35] <%doc_ock_rokc> pokemon is like monster hunter
[2:58:36] <+TaurusOxford> Literal isekai "story"
[2:58:36] <KyberNasse> You catch Pokemon
[2:58:37] <Profmcstevie> "shits fucked woah you look good go grab mons"
[2:58:37] <Dunmarkh> what do you think about your jesus cell phone?
[2:58:40] <%RaziWraith> It's been the same layout for years LUL
[2:58:41] <+tomdwarf> Yeah, its pokemon. Its... ignorable. Who cares. I just like the fact that this is a battle pokemon game without gyms
[2:58:43] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @tanarath there's NUMEROUS Indie Monster Tamers, do you mean TemTem since Pat streamed it?  it's 60 bucks on PS5 and STILL EARLY ACCESS and there's multiple games better that don't copy Pokemon
[2:58:44] <satiresatyr> me I play for story sprry
[2:58:46] <%doc_ock_rokc> the story is a side benefit if it happens
[2:58:47] <cpt_langosta> the story about PROTIP: apricorns contain vast quantities of unprocessed LSD. sell them to children.
[2:58:51] <+polothegreatest> ultramoon is peak story
[2:58:55] <big_oki> you and paige should watch the venture brothers, it'll scratch your will and grace itch
[2:58:59] <+kewlmyc> @Tearonex Then he hasn't gotten to it yet
[2:58:59] <+Catpurnicus> once there was a Patron that wanted to be the very best, the best that ever was, then he did it, the end
[2:59:02] <fuji_n2> the last one KEKW
[2:59:09] <%DoomUnderTheStairs> black and white has a great story
[2:59:12] <%TerpanderLux> alien music
[2:59:15] <Cynical_Canadian> I prefered the base Sun & Moon to the Ultra story
[2:59:16] <Pookiedaexzile> They Took out the Pvp and the Gyms, fuck whats in this thing besides grass
[2:59:17] <satiresatyr> oooh yummy music
[2:59:20] <+zenraider> im hearing BotW noises for things

[2:59:24] <%oda_flobunaga> Wasn't there a Nobunaga Pokemon game?
[2:59:26] <%notsoy> you can sneak up on it
[2:59:28] <+tomdwarf> You could also sneak catch it
[2:59:34] <%코코꾸라> Either fight him or sneak up
[2:59:37] <+tomdwarf> Just, instant it sees you, its gonna attack, then you must fight
[2:59:38] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[2:59:38] <%notsoy> in fact, you should always sneak up on a pokemon for your first try
[2:59:38] <Profmcstevie> When aggro, stealth em up
[2:59:39] <satiresatyr> yes it was good
[2:59:39] <%TerpanderLux> taco bell ding
[2:59:39] <%Axellogic> battle, run away or throw a nut at its head and knock it out
[2:59:45] <Cynical_Canadian> @oda_flobunaga Yeah it wasn't bad from what I've heard
[2:59:47] <%Bread_Assassin> @oda_flobunaga Yeah, Pokemon Conquest.
[2:59:48] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @tomdwarf yes, a game that is entirely focused on teh CATCHING including in battle , is a "Battle" game
[2:59:48] <%DoomUnderTheStairs> your birb is getting fucked
[2:59:49] <satiresatyr> it was one of the ranger series
[2:59:50] <tanarath> @shinobiphoenix yeah, temtem.
[2:59:51] <+polothegreatest> Ah Ds nobunaga
[2:59:54] <Dunmarkh> @oda_flobunaga yeah conquest, it was a great game

[3:00:07] <GeneralHysterics> RIP starly
[3:00:07] <%notsoy> you get huge bonuses to your catch chance if you hit them from behind/catch them off guard
[3:00:12] <Mister_McDerp> starly sucks
[3:00:23] <%Axellogic> Spoiled nuts can be used to daze pokemon that see you  so you can still pokenap them
[3:00:24] <%TerpanderLux> you caught it
[3:00:29] <big_oki> premtive strike
[3:00:29] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @Pookiedaexzile you can't do that, but they can jump you in multiples... as I found out
[3:00:31] <+tomdwarf> @tomdwarf Im refering more to stuff like Pokemon Snap, or other spinoffs where you arent making a team and fighting other pokemon
[3:00:31] <Cynical_Canadian> Bring back Pokemon Colosseum/XD
[3:00:34] <sheepysenka> at night~

[3:03:05] <+Pachi3000> If you favorite items and sort your inventory, favorites will always go to the top of the list

[3:03:24] <Eppielicious> I kept trying to move the item wheel like monster hunter....
[3:03:27] <+Pachi3000> But it doesn't affect your inventory selection in the field I think, only the pause menu
[3:03:29] <%ShinobiPhoenix> it puts them at the top of your bar list
[3:03:34] <+Ricky_Rexx> in other games favorite puts it on like a quick use menu
[3:03:39] <+Ricky_Rexx> idk bout this
[3:03:41] <+ReallyBigRocks> man you really start flyin when you run off the cliff

[3:04:38] <Cynical_Canadian> Have Zangief play Baba is You
[3:04:40] <TopTierHarley> Seeing moves also count if you do them as well
[3:04:42] <%VentWilsn> when are they going to make professor layton puzzles for dogs?
[3:04:45] <+Ricky_Rexx> Do you got a favorite mon Pat?
[3:04:51] <%TerpanderLux> i want to solve a dog puzzle
[3:04:54] <Mattais88> All I want from here is an option for your pokemon to follow you in the world
[3:05:06] <+Pachi3000> psyched for the destruction of humanity
[3:05:10] <GeneralHysterics> STRONG STYLE
[3:05:13] <senfood> STRONG STYLE

[3:05:17] <Virokwet> oh
[3:05:19] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @TopTierHarley given I have said that for an hour, I will try not to be upset
[3:05:19] <%TerpanderLux> yes
[3:05:23] <%chance_h> Is there no fall damage?
[3:05:24] <%bevyrage> it's the closest you'll get to a gimmick i feel
[3:05:26] <+Pachi3000> This happens when a Pokemon 'masters' a move
[3:05:27] <+Ricky_Rexx> @Mattais88 given how movement works in this game compared to more traditional games, that would be really difficult for this game
[3:05:30] <KyberNasse> BRAWLER
[3:05:31] <fuji_n2> you get a tutorial on it later

[3:05:40] <%Axellogic> do more or less damage for slow or fastness
[3:05:43] <+Pachi3000> @chance_h There is, I think Pat was just below the threshold for it
[3:05:46] <Eppielicious> teabag it
[3:05:50] <%Anime_Flux> MESATSU

[3:06:27] <+ReallyBigRocks> so is strong style still priority on quick attack?
[3:06:32] <+Pachi3000> knocked the fuck out
[3:06:42] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @ReallyBigRocks sort of...
[3:06:47] <%Axellogic> @ReallyBigRocks it makes your next turn slower
[3:06:51] <TopTierHarley> Quick attack doesn't have priority lol
[3:06:53] <+jbfelder> jbfelder subscribed with Prime.
[3:06:55] <+Pachi3000> driploon
[3:06:58] <%ShinobiPhoenix> but you can lose your next one or two turns
[3:06:59] <mannywatcha> How did you get a full team already? I was gone too long.
[3:07:04] <%TerpanderLux> throw a dart at him
[3:07:07] <Eppielicious> turn delays or repeats also depend on speed stat
[3:07:11] <mannywatcha> Look out pat that baloon is gonna take you to hell.
[3:07:13] <knight_verse> Check menu to see if you have any Pokemon that can be evolved

[3:07:43] <mannywatcha> Oh god its mad!
[3:07:46] <%kainhighwind1990> so I'm guessing Pat is liking it?
[3:07:53] <TopTierHarley> @Axellogic I'm saying quick attack doesn't always go first in this game
[3:07:54] <mannywatcha> it really is gonna take you in the sky and to hell.
[3:07:58] <%sniffy77> pat pissed off a balloon

[3:08:51] <%JenovasPuppet> @HotSauceFiend They decompose real quick
[3:09:02] <+Pachi3000> HORF
[3:09:06] <+ReallyBigRocks> @HotSauceFiend they can't shrink themselves to get in the ball if they're unconscious
[3:09:08] <%kainhighwind1990> @PatStaresAt What is an Ascian's robe made out of? Emet Silk
[3:09:11] <Eppielicious> changes moves so great
[3:09:18] <cpt_langosta> how are pants different from shirts?
[3:09:18] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @HotSauceFiend I litearlly wrote that as a note to work on for my game, but that game isn't going to be worked on for a long time, my team is working on a different project
[3:09:20] <tanarath> c o n t e n t
[3:09:23] <zerointelligence000> gief is imploding
[3:09:27] <sheepysenka> well this game says they go into the ball consciously so...
[3:09:39] <cosmictrashcan> i feel like some people have been overly critical of the game (mainly the graphics, which do look bad) but honestly this seems really fun so far
[3:09:52] <+ReallyBigRocks> they really like being in the balls
[3:10:01] <TopTierHarley> it's not over critical to say the game looks like shit
[3:10:04] <+2DSuperiority> just use your hands, dumb dog

[3:12:46] <+RyTYoung> No
[3:12:47] <%ShinobiPhoenix> they are done for the saek of teh Pokedex but not for POINTS you can use to Rank up
[3:12:48] <Eppielicious> yup, if you do all the tasks it says "perfect"
[3:12:48] <$Pompadourius> Seems more like Yakuza 7 Pokemon tbh
[3:12:48] <+Pachi3000> You only need 10 blips to complete the pokedex entry. But you can still keep filling out research tasks
[3:12:53] <Cynical_Canadian> Progression, wow
[3:12:55] <+Pachi3000> You can
[3:12:58] <%ShinobiPhoenix> rank are Badges

[3:13:00] <%TerpanderLux> you can

[3:13:06] <%cvp5127> only need 10
[3:13:10] <Eppielicious> shrug if it does anything
[3:13:10] <%ReenMan350> ReenMan350 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 48 months! so is this game fun?
[3:13:11] <%ShinobiPhoenix> they give POINTS
[3:13:11] <%solracc25> can
[3:13:13] <+ReallyBigRocks> number go up tho
[3:13:15] <ReiDuran> you can, you just don't NEED to get them all
[3:13:15] <%ShinobiPhoenix> points are for Ranks

[3:13:19] <+tomdwarf> turn in, they meant
[3:13:19] <%TerpanderLux> turn it on
[3:13:21] <%ataxia72> completing all of them makes shinies more likely to spawn for that pokemon
[3:13:24] <TopTierHarley> typo Pat
[3:13:25] <+Das_Prints> Apparently completely doing all their entry tasks increases the shiny spawn rates for that Pokémon.
[3:13:25] <%solracc25> evolve the boi no problem
[3:13:25] <%doc_ock_rokc> Its like getting the other weapons in monster hunter
[3:13:26] <@Ranryu692> typo?

[3:29:04] <+Zix_Serro> Go to your inventory and equip it.
[3:29:06] <+FlyingRamen> Party menu

[3:30:20] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> ok, 4:30 am, I'll catch the rest in VOD land
[3:30:23] <Cynical_Canadian> Nice they finally added swappable moves
[3:30:24] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Game Freak was basically forced into making console games after Switch became the next thing.
[3:30:27] <%kainhighwind1990> @PatStaresAt Hey Pat, I showed a dog that I'm dogsitting uh oh stinky and it had the same reaction as Gief - I think dogs hyst might hate that gorilla

[3:33:41] <rasamune> Man you could come at a Pokemon with a chainsaw in this world and it'd just be like "oh no it fainted"
[3:33:45] <ToneBacas> dogs hate NFTs? who would have thought
[3:33:48] <+Lillowh> @Lillowh western Europe would at least be filtered through Japanese perception of western europe so probably that one
[3:33:49] <DXLelouch24> my Shih Tzus didnt give a fuck about the gorilla Pat, NOT ONE FUCK
[3:33:49] <churropoppa> @Dakuu75 the one where you shoot pokemon? Nintendo DMCAed it already

[3:33:58] <%HotSauceFiend> so are shiny pokemon a thing here>?
[3:34:01] <Cynical_Canadian> My dog just walked away from it

[3:43:38] <zerointelligence000> I kinda dig how stealth captures look like stealth kills
[3:43:39] <+kewlmyc> Wait, since this is single player only, I assume there's another method to get Golum now?
[3:43:41] <+gloomsi> i suddenly want to hear xqc say geodude
[3:43:45] <%Jhylla81> Do they ever explain why Geodude floats? Magnets?
[3:43:48] <%TerpanderLux> shit :)
[3:43:49] <%notsoy> trade-only evolutions are now evolved by new special items
[3:43:50] <+Pachi3000> @neraren There's an item that lets you do trade evolutions in-game
[3:43:50] <+tomdwarf> So swap, cause rowlet is gonna get hurt bad
[3:43:53] <luciluxlu0> you just can, no trading necessary I think
[3:43:53] <$IzazaOzihaha> Leaf is effective
[3:43:53] <+hasansviewcountbot> What happens to the replicas when you capture them?
[3:43:54] <%HotSauceFiend> but the lead thing is supereffective
[3:43:56] <TopTierHarley> you literally have a grass move lol
[3:43:58] <%HotSauceFiend> leaf*
[3:43:59] <Gav_EXE> Doesn't know Grass is super effective. :(
[3:44:00] <%W1nterTitan> @kewlmyc yeah you can get it in game now
[3:44:00] <+FingaLights> I never understood how trading made pokemon evolve
[3:44:02] <%cooldude69xx> Geodudette
[3:44:02] <%TheLemuroid> leafage would be good too
[3:44:02] <BlazieTiger> leafage would be quad effective
[3:44:06] <%marvel877> apparently there's an item that you can get to evolve trade only evolutions.
[3:44:10] <%Toast_Master_General> grass is good against rock\]
[3:44:11] <+Dives__> Are female Geodudes called Geodudettes?
[3:44:16] <%cooldude69xx> @FingaLights radiation
[3:44:17] <+Pachi3000> pincer attack!
[3:44:22] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @neraren the same way as Pokemon Go, items

[3:44:30] <%HotSauceFiend> @FingaLights upon escaping your master, you feel determined to evolve
[3:44:35] <anachronologist> This game looks fucking awesome
[3:44:35] <Cynical_Canadian> The Art of War
[3:44:37] <%Valdorick> @Toast_Master_General but flying is bad against rock.

[3:52:50] <Cynical_Canadian> I wonder what the Palworld version of ditto will be, just straight up breeding room
[3:52:55] <TopTierHarley> np
[3:52:58] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I am waiting for Laxidaze
[3:53:01] <Gav_EXE> Even the females have mustaches. :)
[3:53:01] <%YakumoYomi> 8'2
[3:53:03] <%TerpanderLux> :)
[3:53:03] <+gloomsi> does it evolve into sigma
[3:53:03] <Pookiedaexzile> Get Geodude and him on the team fuck loyality
[3:53:06] <cthulu_fearlock> evolved from sigma to alpha
[3:53:10] <tjkillemup2> It takes a true Sigma male to beat an alpha
[3:53:18] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Lazidaze is SMT, with Astral Chain with Pokemon
[3:53:32] <%YakumoYomi> Empty the Gief
[3:53:40] <+gloomsi> @cthulu_fearlock everyone knows sigma beats alpha, this is basic pokemon lore
[3:54:02] <%DoomUnderTheStairs> I hope they have some other new evolutions for single pokemon in this
[3:54:07] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I have a list of Monster Tamers I am waiting for and Palworld isn't one of them until i see more than just it being a Shooter people are overhyping
[3:54:12] <%oda_flobunaga> Sigma male, Alpha male, What about the Ligma male?
[3:54:29] <+johnygplays> Oshawott for life
[3:54:35] <+gloomsi> ligma balls
[3:54:40] <+gloomsi> the new type of pokeball
[3:54:57] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Laxidaze, Final Stardust, Coromon, Cassette Beasts, Untamed Isles
[3:55:43] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I lost all my hype for TemTem
[3:56:19] <%ShinyDemonGuy> ShinyDemonGuy subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 15 months! Pokieman?! Pokieman with the pokie and the man and the spae where the guy comes out into the spae and he go wahk in the  gwhga hgwa gha ghe!
[3:57:03] <mckraven> Well sadly Tem Tem just doesn't have the same amount of people working on it that pokemon does. There's just no way theey can put out as much substantial content as fast
[3:57:31] <%bevyrage> yeah it's why temtem is working on one game over more than a year's worth of development
[3:57:43] <%TerpanderLux> nice
[3:57:46] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @mckraven that's not at all why I lost my hype for it, the same can be said for the other 8 games on my list
[3:58:08] <+ScrapKingKeita> FRENZIED?
[3:58:13] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Are they repeating this scene a third time already?
[3:58:14] <%NopeBadguy> KLEAVOR IS SICK

[4:04:30] <DianaTheAscian> your Jesus
[4:04:32] <Pookiedaexzile> Woah
[4:04:32] <JacknZack27> 15 is old enough for murder
[4:04:39] <%thedankestmeeme> how does this game look worst than sword and shield?

[4:06:59] <%oda_flobunaga> @ShinobiPhoenix Genpuku at 16
[4:07:07] <+2DSuperiority> you may intrigue him with a slice of cheese
[4:07:10] <+deathyGZ> this story feels like a burden on the game
[4:07:28] <%TerpanderLux> theres soooooo much moon2W
[4:07:31] <%ShinobiPhoenix> it's like there's a story or somethiuung
[4:07:34] <mckraven> never stop talking
[4:07:39] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> This scene is still going?
[4:07:39] <%YakumoYomi> Is this turning into rule34? Because it sounds like it's turning into rule34.
[4:07:43] <%legendfather_of_giants> you're being targeted because you said there was no story @PatStaresAt
[4:07:44] <%Tearonex> It's story
[4:07:46] <cpt_langosta> wow, that abra in the bg had super low framerate
[4:07:51] <%TerpanderLux> they should have made the story good to listen to
[4:07:51] <%Logoth_> Hurray its just like FF14
[4:07:52] <%Sotetsu> Hey, Paige got through the beginning of Monster Hunter. You can get through this.
[4:07:52] <+CptCreampuff16> gotta story
[4:07:56] <+CptCreampuff16> for god
[4:07:56] <%Tearonex> not great story mind you LUL
[4:07:57] <BlazieTiger> Pokemon in a nutshell why say five words when 15,000 will do
[4:07:58] <%DovaDude29> Bruh shut up, just let PAT POKÉMON!!
[4:07:58] <+AGood_Noodle> Digimon has it WAYYY worse
[4:08:00] <Pookiedaexzile> They are trying there best, The Pokemon team doesn't usually write this hard
[4:08:02] <+kewlmyc> Does this run on Yuzu yet?
[4:08:06] <%D00msDayDan> there's a rampaging kleavor, go hunt it to advance to the next hunter rank
[4:08:06] <mckraven> @ShinobiPhoenix it's basically redundent padding at this point
[4:08:08] <+polothegreatest> PokBraixen prof. harkness?
[4:08:09] <%SaphronBlackbourne> I'll be completely honest, I've been mashing A thorugh the story text
[4:08:09] <gslayer14> brilliant dumbass
[4:08:10] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Monster Hunter has a LONG onboarding
[4:08:10] <+2DSuperiority> people complained about how much dialouge Sun Moon had so Sword Shield's story was actually nothing
[4:08:12] <+deathyGZ> theyre saying nothing with a lot of words
[4:08:18] <sandsim> this could be summed up in three words, go kill kleavor
[4:08:19] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Guys you can have a story without just repeating information over and over
[4:08:22] <%cvp5127> @kewlmyc working on ryujinx
[4:08:31] <%SaphronBlackbourne> It points exactly where to go so I don't need to pay attention to it
[4:08:31] <+PrimalDweeb> Wouldn't be so bad if it was just voice acted like it should be!
[4:08:32] <%marvel877> are we still in the tutorial?
[4:08:34] <cpt_langosta> BAGGINS
[4:08:47] <gslayer14> bagin! the bagman!
[4:08:48] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @mckraven it's for children, who have lower comprehension... funny how adults are never having it
[4:08:52] <Pookiedaexzile> Pats asking for that guys tip
[4:09:04] <Pookiedaexzile> Does he also want his balls
[4:09:06] <%TerpanderLux> Yes
[4:09:14] <mass1997> Well to be fair pat skipping through the text so fast it's hard for me to judge LOL
[4:09:15] <satiresatyr> there is a lot of ainu influences in this game so it's best to read up on the ainu riot and Russian/Japan war to understand the timeline too
[4:09:18] <sheepysenka> Teach me!
[4:09:38] <%cvp5127> its uneven tho
[4:09:51] <Maxicqwe> war in a pokemon game??
[4:09:53] <%ShinobiPhoenix> never ceases to amaze me how much more patience children have now than adults
[4:09:57] <%MonsterEnvy> @Pat hey how are you enjoying the game so far?
[4:09:58] <Polyceramic> i love this music so much
[4:10:09] <%TerpanderLux> moon2BED
[4:10:09] <satiresatyr> yeah...
[4:10:12] <+tblitz117> surprised ocd didn't yell for him to get the last 2 slots
[4:10:19] <%FoxEarsOak> this chat has a bizarre amount of defense of the severe shortcomings of this game
[4:10:26] <+mrjplays2k9> the intro to this theme reminds me of Ultima Thule
[4:10:28] <%ShinobiPhoenix> children put up with licensed NES games....
[4:10:31] <sheepysenka> hah poke kokeshi
[4:10:35] <+tblitz117> their straight money
[4:10:36] <%kainhighwind1990> @PatStaresAt Do you agree that this is a proof of concept game for like an actual next gen Pokemon game?
[4:10:36] <%MonsterEnvy> @PatStaresAt How are you enjoying the game so far?
[4:10:43] <satiresatyr> I'm half Japanese and have relatives in Hokkaido which is the place Sinnoh region is based on
[4:10:55] <gslayer14> get wood
[4:10:55] <%oda_flobunaga> As shit as this looks their mouths move, unlike FromSoft
[4:11:12] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @kainhighwind1990 like Let's Go Eevee and Pikachu was for Gen 8.......
[4:11:16] <AllenDeadman> it's ncie to have a game where you actually have to catch them all
[4:11:21] <AllenDeadman> very jank
[4:11:21] <%MonsterEnvy> Yeah sorry for asking the question you keep getting asked.
[4:11:37] <Frostydough1> so game good? oh how bad jank? like bad enough not to buy?
[4:11:38] <twoah> I played Lion King on SNES as a kid. I was forged in patience
[4:12:06] <%notsoy> lol no modern game compares to the shitshow that was SNES/genesis-era licensed trash
[4:12:11] <cpt_langosta> push him into the water
[4:12:13] <+mrjplays2k9> have any regular animals shown up?
[4:12:24] <The_Legendairy> having swappable movesets per pokemon is like the #1 thing they need to bring to the main game
[4:12:24] <%MonsterEnvy> @PatStaresAt Also you a bit weirded out that shrinking is apparently just an innate Pokemon  ability. And it's why wild ones disappear when defeated.
[4:12:34] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I am absolutely having the time of my life playing Arceus, gameplay is what matters to me, especially as a tabletop designer, gameplay is everything
[4:12:39] <%RetroCop87> bro
[4:13:01] <cpt_langosta> it's VOLDO TIME
[4:13:05] <%MonsterEnvy> Hey Cynthia ancestor.
[4:13:06] <Shwepie> This tree is so bad because it has baked in lighting. Top of the branches are all lit up perfectly and the bottom are all shaded. Clashes with everything else.
[4:13:17] <%ShinobiPhoenix> oh you don't have the recipe for those
[4:13:20] <+mrjplays2k9> never use them
[4:13:20] <%oda_flobunaga> Volothramp
[4:13:27] <%MonsterEnvy> I always think of Volo from Forgotten Realms when I see his game.
[4:13:31] <%MonsterEnvy> his name
[4:13:31] <%RetroCop87> that dude just gave you free super potions, he's alright
[4:13:33] <%ShinobiPhoenix> the recipe for Super Potions is at Rank 2
[4:13:44] <%TerpanderLux> oorf
[4:13:44] <%chance_h> Now to consume all the potions!
[4:13:54] <Jim_Placebo> @MonsterEnvy Thank you! Thought I was the only one
[4:14:06] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I have a RADICALLY different team
[4:14:11] <+mrjplays2k9> can you get golem without trade?
[4:14:21] <%MonsterEnvy> @PatStaresAt Do you know how to name Pokémon?
[4:14:23] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @mrjplays2k9 yes
[4:14:33] <%TerpanderLux> hes a piece of shit
[4:14:36] <%MonsterEnvy> It kidnapps kids.
[4:14:37] <%RetroCop87> Pat, if you raise a pokemon to it's evolved form, it'll be stronger than catching that evolved form
[4:14:37] <cpt_langosta> it fucks hard
[4:14:38] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @MonsterEnvy submenu
[4:14:38] <%MonsterEnvy> so yeah.
[4:14:39] <maxpasta> OhMyDog
[4:14:39] <%notsoy> yes, there's a special item to evolve former trade-onlies
[4:14:44] <%echobee_tv> my man
[4:14:45] <%legendfather_of_giants> YES
[4:14:46] <%TerpanderLux> nice

[4:15:44] <Alzero83> it looks like a nintendo game
[4:15:44] <+tblitz117> someone will return em
[4:15:45] <%TerpanderLux> someone has to find the bag i think???
[4:15:45] <ohno58> dark souls
[4:15:46] <luciluxlu0> somebody else has to
[4:15:50] <ToneBacas> get rekt, foul tarnished
[4:15:51] <+tblitz117> it's an online mechanic
[4:15:53] <%oda_flobunaga> If Pat gets a vulpix, Peach needs to voice it
[4:15:56] <$IzazaOzihaha> Can't you check the map to retrieve a satchel?
[4:15:57] <%SaiyanShoto> You can from lost and found if another player in another game finds them
[4:15:58] <%ShinobiPhoenix> yes.... IF ANOTHER PLAYER gets them for you
[4:16:00] <%Soliloquy123> @PatStaresAt Another player can find your bag in their game and send it to you
[4:16:01] <+Rare_Ruiz> You? Not too harsh? Absurd.
[4:16:05] <DianaTheAscian> be harsh af
[4:16:08] <chai_wolf> talk shit get hit lol
[4:16:13] <dan_g_v> get your souls back
[4:16:14] <Daniel_Is_I> And XC2 as well
[4:16:16] <%echobee_tv> And Mario Odyssey
[4:16:19] <+Catpurnicus> and monster hunter rise
[4:16:21] <The_Legendairy> beath of the wild is a WiiU game
[4:16:22] <HotMafia81> BOTW also ran on the WiiU
[4:16:23] <%NopeBadguy> game freak is a small indie company :)
[4:16:28] <%greasypete00> it's literally just gamefreak who can't figure it out
[4:16:29] <%ShinobiPhoenix> players in THEIR GAMES can find YOUR ITEMS and RETURN THEM and get rewards
[4:16:31] <+Catpurnicus> and the other monster hunter rpg
[4:16:33] <%TerpanderLux> we
[4:16:34] <%marvel877> and Xenoblade
[4:16:35] <%chiluzza> im positive that PGC dont understand how graphics work
[4:16:36] <EaseTheSquirrel> you can, kind of, basically they become an item for people with an online connection to retrieve, and they can find your "lost satchel" and get it for you
[4:16:36] <%RetroCop87> it's a step up for the franchise, but the franchise has been a 2/10 leading up to now
[4:16:36] <%optimasmaximas> this is the one time ill defend gamefreak
[4:16:39] <Brandon__Brando> this feels like this should of been the release game
[4:16:39] <%RayReborne> yeah even THAT looks way better
[4:16:39] <%chance_h> You just killed a child @pats… Good job, that’s why you’re the best
[4:16:40] <+pabloelenano2> the witcher
[4:16:40] <Blank9> and xenoblade 1+2
[4:16:40] <Parapattern> This looks like an asset flip
[4:16:41] <+mrjplays2k9> Idk What the pokemon company was thinking
[4:16:42] <ToneBacas> this is not even breaking new ground or anything on a technical level
[4:16:45] <Daniel_Is_I> XC:X on the  Wii U looks GREAT compared to this
[4:16:46] <%SirGO0SE> i cant believe how many 3d pokemon games we've had and there are still better looking gamecube games
[4:16:46] <ammobasket> this literally looks like craftopia
[4:16:47] <%notsoy> a shame tpci will never give any devs they higher a proper budget/schedule
[4:16:49] <%optimasmaximas> they could never have gotten enough time to finsiht this
[4:16:49] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Xenoblade had voice acting too
[4:16:50] <Pookiedaexzile> SPIT YO TRUTH
[4:16:51] <%MonsterEnvy> @PatStaresAt Apparently this looks pretty decent with the OLED. But yeah Gamefreak is not at the best at optimizing graphics
[4:16:52] <Ghostduck01> thats not harsh, thats reasonable. your right and you should say it
[4:16:54] <%notsoy> *they hire
[4:16:58] <+polothegreatest> have botw on wiiu and xeno X. can confirm
[4:17:00] <%SaiyanShoto> And monolith soft even helped with this apparently
[4:17:01] <knight_verse> No it doesn't, have you seen that shit lately?
[4:17:04] <Blank9> xenoblade had so much voice acting, and animations
[4:17:05] <Brandon__Brando> this doesn't look done
[4:17:05] <%RetroCop87> that jump is jank
[4:17:06] <ohno58> This game needs parkour
[4:17:07] <%optimasmaximas> this game clearly needs another like 2 years to be fleshed out
[4:17:07] <JacknZack27> That is absolutely not true.
[4:17:09] <%DashXero> One of the things I feel is creating the dogshit aesthetic is the color palette.
[4:17:15] <+xtkxyz> LUL
[4:17:16] <%marvel877> And Xenoblade on the Wii looked like a late PS2 game and it still looked better than this
[4:17:16] <%FoxEarsOak> what will happen when the one programmer at gamefreak retires?
[4:17:18] <%TerpanderLux> he bigs
[4:17:19] <JacknZack27> The switch version looks better tho
[4:17:20] <%DashXero> Everything's so muted.
[4:17:23] <%echobee_tv> HUGE
[4:17:24] <@Ranryu692> oh jeez lol
[4:17:25] <%chiluzza> LOOK AT THE LARGE LAD
[4:17:25] <%RayReborne> wtf! huh?
[4:17:26] <A_Windmill> BIG MAN
[4:17:29] <EaseTheSquirrel> the alpha's are huge
[4:17:29] <%TerpanderLux> PIKACHU
[4:17:30] <%W1nterTitan> yo wtf
[4:17:32] <%RayReborne> giant kricketune
[4:17:33] <BlazieTiger> PICHU
[4:17:33] <+mrjplays2k9> WHY IS HE THAT BIG
[4:17:33] <%TerpanderLux> ITS PIKACHU jermaVenus
[4:17:33] <%optimasmaximas> pichu
[4:17:34] <jowi_time> this seems like a pilot game, so I wonder what their budget was
[4:17:35] <ohno58> BEAT ITS ASS
[4:17:35] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt Game Freak will never be able to develop on a scale outside of AA because The Pokemon Company would rather funnel all that money into merch
[4:17:37] <%SaiyanShoto> What a pussy
[4:17:41] <+Rofiarf> where on the map are you!
[4:17:42] <%TerpanderLux> KILL HIM
[4:17:43] <%chance_h> psaBig
[4:17:44] <$IzazaOzihaha> Thas a Pichu
[4:17:44] <%chiluzza> ITS PICHU ENSLAVE IT
[4:17:44] <cpt_langosta> no, it's a bigaaaah, pat, get it right
[4:17:46] <%RayReborne> yeah pichu
[4:17:48] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @PatStaresAt it's an Online mechanic, players in THEIR GAMES can find YOUR ITEMS and RETURN THEM and get rewards
[4:17:48] <+polothegreatest> pichuu woolieSPICE
[4:17:50] <+twdlrr> Gamefreak is probably ran by the Stegosauruses
[4:17:50] <%marvel877> kill it
[4:17:51] <%oda_flobunaga> Brochu
[4:17:52] <%chance_h> Get him!
[4:17:54] <EaseTheSquirrel> all alphas are bigger than they're supposed to be and they can get huge
[4:17:58] <AKW4RD_BUFF4LO> Yeah I caught a Pichu this evening :)
[4:17:59] <+Catpurnicus> the artstyle of the terrain doesn't match the character art at all
[4:18:00] <%TerpanderLux> KILL

[4:18:02] <+mrjplays2k9> DOME HIM

[4:18:16] <ohno58> he just quick attacked your ass
[4:18:16] <Brandon__Brando> I can't wait to hear hopeless fanboys defend this game for years
[4:18:21] <knight_verse> BotW looked good, but was empty of actual content, Xenoblades looked ok, but you can't call what it had acrual gameplay because you barely had any input.
[4:18:22] <+kewlmyc> Pichu!
[4:18:25] <+mrjplays2k9> turned into sonichu
[4:18:26] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Remember guys, criticism and wanting improvements is apparently "toxic"

[4:18:36] <+kewlmyc> COWARD

[4:19:03] <+mrjplays2k9> THE BIRD FRAME RATE
[4:19:05] <%marvel877> what bird?
[4:19:12] <+kewlmyc> Dead
[4:19:16] <%Birdigalore> WOOOOOOOOOP
[4:19:16] <+Catpurnicus> years from now, when a 3d pokemon game actually looks good, fans are going to be conditioned to have nostalgia for shitty graphics instead
[4:19:17] <ohno58> your bug got fucked
[4:19:20] <SulfurousAcid> Bird Up
[4:19:23] <AKW4RD_BUFF4LO> My Pichu just evolved into a Pikachu :)

[4:19:26] <sheepysenka> deadlelelelewooop
[4:19:29] <+tblitz117> there's criticism and just being toxic for the fuck of it

[4:19:47] <Calamity2007> @Catpurnicus So never LUL
[4:19:49] <Shin_goob> this gane doesn't look too bad in handheld mode. I'd imagine having it blown up on a big screen would make it look shitty
[4:19:49] <+ScrapKingKeita> at least there is Geodude is good against birbs
[4:19:56] <%TerpanderLux> hes dead now
[4:19:58] <%chiazam> Pat has completely forgotten Pokémon types
[4:19:59] <%optimasmaximas> LUL
[4:20:00] <+PrimalDweeb> LUL
[4:20:01] <%legendfather_of_giants> ABUSE
[4:20:02] <A_Windmill> what is this wild bop
[4:20:03] <%TerpanderLux> yes
[4:20:05] <+PwnyB> Geodead.
[4:20:06] <+Catpurnicus> "I miss pokemon when it wasn't trying to be zelda"
[4:20:06] <@Ranryu692> why does this game look worse than an EDF game?
[4:20:07] <+EmotionalFatGuy> its ok he landed in water.  very safe
[4:20:08] <%NopeBadguy> that geodude is DEAD
[4:20:09] <%Birdigalore> Yoiu threw him in the water!  He's super dead!
[4:20:11] <+PwnyB> Gottem.
[4:20:13] <%notsoy> nah, you can recall him
[4:20:14] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @ScrapKingKeita Bidoof was already good against birds this early
[4:20:18] <ohno58> liar
[4:20:20] <hueley> ROP rockface
[4:20:28] <%ShinobiPhoenix> and Shinx has Ice and THunder
[4:20:35] <+mrjplays2k9> if fucking heracross is in this game, hes going on my team
[4:20:38] <%ShinobiPhoenix> yes, rock go SPLAT
[4:20:40] <%chiluzza> you ever hit a bug with a rock?
[4:20:42] <%TerpanderLux> it tells you when you highlight the move
[4:20:42] <Mothraken> CHECK THE TYPE CHART
[4:20:45] <+ScrapKingKeita> @ShinobiPhoenix Geodude also resists is the important part
[4:20:45] <@Ranryu692> rocks squish bugs
[4:20:52] <%MonsterEnvy> @PatStaresAt Don't forget about Agile style for a chance to go twice ina  row.
[4:20:53] <%TerpanderLux> in the moves tooltip
[4:20:58] <+burnie_mcburntface> @mrjplays2k9 He is
[4:21:00] <%notsoy> the icon on the right tells you if it's super-effective or not
[4:21:00] <+TaurusOxford> it is
[4:21:00] <%optimasmaximas> yes
[4:21:02] <+ScrapKingKeita> Gen 8 added a type chart, this should have one too
[4:21:03] <ohno58> you literally saw it earlier?
[4:21:04] <$scallycap> you got one earlier. you made fun of it
[4:21:05] <%legendfather_of_giants> you already saw it
[4:21:07] <hananafell> Its in the move details
[4:21:08] <+kewlmyc> You complained about how it looked like a spreadsheet, Pat
[4:21:08] <@Ranryu692> you saw it
[4:21:09] <%MonsterEnvy> Yeah it's in the toolips
[4:21:11] <%chiazam> Yes
[4:21:17] <%legendfather_of_giants> yes
[4:21:18] <ChronoRomancer> yes
[4:21:20] <+TaurusOxford> Yes
[4:21:23] <%ShinobiPhoenix> the tooltip that you complained about
[4:21:27] <%optimasmaximas> yes again
[4:21:27] <%MelBrooksKA> They literally showed it earlier
[4:21:28] <leaplearning> yes
[4:21:30] <%SirGO0SE> you commented on it earlier i thought
[4:21:30] <%TerpanderLux> :)
[4:21:34] <+Catpurnicus> oh no, I just realized, this game is what it would look like if that "Nintendo, Hire This Man" dude got to make his unreal game with a mario model in it
[4:21:34] <JacknZack27> It was that thing you made fun of earlier
[4:21:36] <Mothraken> hell yeah it looks so good Kappa Kappa
[4:21:39] <%ShinobiPhoenix> you can, on your phone
[4:21:40] <Dunmarkh> it's so bad tho
[4:21:42] <+PrimalDweeb> That's awful
[4:21:45] <%TerpanderLux> yeah so just download all that information instantly and youll be good :)
[4:21:52] <%NopeBadguy> just pull up pokemondb or bulbapedia tbh @PatStaresAt
[4:21:57] <%ShinobiPhoenix> this information has been known for 20 years
[4:22:00] <+mrjplays2k9> just memorize it quickly
[4:22:07] <%ShinobiPhoenix> or use the PokeType APP
[4:22:08] <%chiluzza> and it doesnt even deal with pokemons with double types
[4:22:12] <+ScrapKingKeita> it is a Paras!
[4:22:15] <%chiluzza> that is a paras
[4:22:15] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I LOVE the PokeType App
[4:22:16] <SulfurousAcid> paras
[4:22:17] <DancesWitBalrog> 4Head
[4:22:18] <SulfurousAcid> pog
[4:22:20] <%oda_flobunaga> Le Paris
[4:22:22] <+TaurusOxford> @ShinobiPhoenix That's not a good reason for people who don't actively play pokemon
[4:22:24] <%marvel877> is the stream messing up for anyone else?
[4:22:25] <cpt_langosta> no, paris is in france. you're in quebec. i know its confusing sometimes.
[4:22:25] <Pookiedaexzile> Pokemon Fans really demand you enjoy this game
[4:22:25] <SulfurousAcid> the plant bug terrible typing pokemon
[4:22:26] <knight_verse> @catpurnicus there's  a reason that dude doesn't work at Nintendo.
[4:22:27] <%chance_h> That looks like a mother fucking scanntron for a shitty test
[4:22:27] <%notsoy> GANG BANG LMAO
[4:22:28] <Dunmarkh> Just play the games for literally 20 years and memorize the matchups
[4:22:28] <Parapattern> Mushroom Man
[4:22:29] <%ShinobiPhoenix> YES
[4:22:32] <A_Windmill> two parii
[4:22:35] <%TerpanderLux> yeah you aggroed 2
[4:22:35] <%Soliloquy123> I mean so many of them are fairly obvious or just so easy to remember that most people will just need to use it to look one matchup up real quick then move on
[4:22:37] <%chiluzza> two paras you gon fight two
[4:22:40] <+mrjplays2k9> paras has asthma
[4:22:41] <%SirGO0SE> oh you walked into the wrong neighborhood
[4:22:43] <+max_radical> who was in paras?
[4:22:47] <%MonsterEnvy> Yeah you agroed them both
[4:22:47] <Pookiedaexzile> Yes
[4:22:48] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt had a friend make a dual-type chart, it's way more fucked
[4:22:49] <sulkcessor> @A_Windmill parae
[4:22:49] <ohno58> how does a rock guy get poisoned?
[4:22:49] <%TerpanderLux> purple piss
[4:22:58] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @ShinobiPhoenix and for those people the type listing of moves is listed IN BATTLE
[4:23:03] <hueley> They can sometimes gang up on your ass
[4:23:05] <AKW4RD_BUFF4LO> @PatStaresAt Yeah you can battle multiple at once if they’re close
[4:23:10] <umaisleep> No don’t poison a rock
[4:23:11] <%solracc25> yup
[4:23:16] <SulfurousAcid> they keep pissing on him D:
[4:23:17] <%Mr_Pylon> I really like Paras, wish I liked Parasect.
[4:23:18] <sulkcessor> @A_Windmill wait that's also wrong LUL nevermind
[4:23:19] <%TerpanderLux> how can a rock get sick lmao
[4:23:28] <+mrjplays2k9> poisoned by his constituants
[4:23:30] <%ShinobiPhoenix> you can total poison rock
[4:23:33] <+ScrapKingKeita> @TerpanderLux because its a dude
[4:23:42] <%ShinobiPhoenix> as a person who LOVES to poison
[4:23:55] <rasamune> yeah they poisoned the dude part
[4:23:58] <+TaurusOxford> @ShinobiPhoenix Yes, but streamers are naturally blind. LUL
[4:23:58] <ToneBacas> he's a geode, and he's also a dude
[4:24:03] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Pokemon, Magic the Gathering, RPGs: poison
[4:24:04] <$scallycap> unintendable?
[4:24:07] <+pabloelenano2> skyrim parkour
[4:24:13] <%TerpanderLux> monkaS

[4:24:22] <+max_radical> they did a botw clone with no climbing?
[4:24:23] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @ShinobiPhoenix not all
[4:24:25] <+CptCreampuff16> \autosave
[4:24:27] <cpt_langosta> cumulonimbus cloud
[4:24:29] <TurtlesAndTentacles> I'm lurking cause I don't want to be spoiled but how is Pat liking the game?
[4:24:32] <+ScrapKingKeita> grass
[4:24:32] <%ShinobiPhoenix> FIGHTING
[4:24:33] <jowi_time> water
[4:24:34] <Cervantas> is pat liking arceus?
[4:24:36] <%SirGO0SE> paper type
[4:24:38] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> it's just like Death Stranding
[4:24:39] <Jim_Placebo> grass
[4:24:40] <%lucasoptics> fighting, grass, water
[4:24:40] <%TerpanderLux> pat likes the game
[4:24:41] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Water, FIGHTING
[4:24:52] <+TaurusOxford> @ShinobiPhoenix Okay fine, all who aren't dedicated Pokemon streamers. Kappa
[4:24:56] <%legendfather_of_giants> @TurtlesAndTentacles his favorite modern Pokemon, graphics suck hard tho
[4:24:58] <ohno58> You see any cool pokemon yet?
[4:25:01] <knight_verse> Gotta love how Pat keeps trying to not do the main missions to get out of the tutorial area and receive the ride Pokemon. Kappa
[4:25:03] <%ShinobiPhoenix> you can tutor Rock Smash onto many mons with the REdhead lady
[4:25:10] <+mrjplays2k9> too bad buizel doesnt shoot projectiles out of his ass in this one
[4:25:11] <TurtlesAndTentacles> @terpanderlux Awesome
[4:25:19] <%TerpanderLux> i love it
[4:25:21] <A_Windmill> wish there was a toggle on it
[4:25:28] <$scallycap> some men like a challenge. not me
[4:25:28] <Paperware> The Pizza is aggressive
[4:25:30] <Daniel_Is_I> Some people were apparently leveling so fast in this game that their pokemon stopped listening to them
[4:25:30] <$IzazaOzihaha> Cuz it make grindy game easy
[4:25:31] <+ScrapKingKeita> It's annoying having to press B whenever a pokemon levels, when you're trying to not level it up
[4:25:32] <EaseTheSquirrel> it works really well for this game's format
[4:25:33] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @ShinobiPhoenix not all streamers lack awareness of details... don't troll
[4:25:37] <+bassforte123> @TurtlesAndTentacles he doesn't like the graphics but the gameplay itself is different and fun
[4:25:39] <%Nobrev> rpgs with shared party exp are inherently better imo
[4:25:40] <+mrjplays2k9> people hate xp share because it makes their video game for children too easy
[4:25:43] <ohno58> it makes an already easy game super easy. Which was fine as long as we could turn it off.
[4:25:47] <%greasypete00> and that's bad because it is
[4:25:51] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Too easy to become overleveled in the past couple games, no option to turn it off
[4:25:52] <Brandon__Brando> I love it I think grinding is Bs
[4:25:52] <%epide> @A_Windmill there was for sword
[4:25:52] <kinkade_77> they dont balance for it
[4:25:53] <%TerpanderLux> pokemon hit hard in this game
[4:25:54] <ToneBacas> this beats walking in tall grass and getting into random encounters
[4:25:55] <TurtlesAndTentacles> @shinobiphoenix I like the look but I know it's a point of contention for sure
[4:25:55] <%Axellogic> This game has way better difficulty than pokemon usually does
[4:25:56] <%notsoy> lol as if any pokemon was ever actually difficult
[4:25:57] <+CptCreampuff16> why do people not like exp share nothing difficult about killing 5000 starlys
[4:26:03] <%NopeBadguy> @mrjplays2k9 the biggest argument against xp share is that it makes ev training a pain
[4:26:15] <%notsoy> i appreciate the XP share making switching in new permanent party members actually feasible
[4:26:17] <SulfurousAcid> a wood
[4:26:24] <+PwnyB> @PatStaresAt It's because it's untoggleable and GF doesn't know how to not cause that to snowball the difficulty curve. It's not even about the Grind in my perspective.
[4:26:26] <%Nobrev> pokemon fans tend to confuse difficulty with tedium
[4:26:27] <%MonsterEnvy> Oh a Bidoof damn
[4:26:27] <leaplearning> ev sharing makes the game less grindy
[4:26:28] <%SirGO0SE> you also dont get that feeling of dread everytime a random encounter starts and youre trying to get somewhere, thats cool
[4:26:33] <sulkcessor> TIL
[4:26:34] <Madinki> It's makes the needless grind easy and that's somehow A BAD THING
[4:26:34] <SulfurousAcid> log is wood peepoHappy
[4:26:35] <Brandon__Brando> one wood
[4:26:36] <+TaurusOxford> @ShinobiPhoenix Dude i'm having fun. Stop taking what are clearly jokes so seriously. Relax.
[4:26:41] <hananafell> Danger approaches
[4:26:43] <$scallycap> ayyy im bidoofin over here
[4:26:44] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @PatStaresAt sexy redhead lady can tutor Rock Smash (Fighting) onto many of your mons for $500
[4:26:44] <+ScrapKingKeita> @CptCreampuff16 I don't wanna level up a specific Pokemon in my party as I'm traveling to a specific area and the argument of "Put it in the box" defeats the reason for having a Pokemon in the party
[4:26:44] <HotMafia81> Logs made of wood?  Gonna need to see your sources on that, pal
[4:26:46] <metabot64> ev training is affected by a pokemons level?
[4:26:47] <Cervantas> xp share is fine not having the option to not use it is bad, it's that simple
[4:26:51] <+bassforte123> Really the exp share thing is weird because... why not make it on by default for the main demographic but you can turn it off in the options if you want to
[4:26:55] <SulfurousAcid> that bidoof hit pretty hard
[4:27:03] <ohno58> Pure normals are the tanks of pokemon
[4:27:07] <EaseTheSquirrel> have you gotten fucked up by any of the non scripted alphas that are around
[4:27:14] <+kewlmyc> I thought Bidoof was part water, or is that only its evolved form?
[4:27:25] <+TaurusOxford> @kewlmyc only Bibarel
[4:27:26] <%notsoy> only its evolution
[4:27:27] <EaseTheSquirrel> thats only the evolved one
[4:27:28] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @kewlmyc only evo
[4:27:28] <%MonsterEnvy> Evolved form
[4:27:34] <Cervantas> bidoof is normal, bibarel is water

[4:30:04] <%TerpanderLux> theres ducks in this game?
[4:30:06] <$IzazaOzihaha> @kewlmyc No
[4:30:07] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Psyduck who still isn't Psychic

[4:30:58] <+TaurusOxford> you turned it into dust!!
[4:31:00] <+mrjplays2k9> he turned into leek
[4:31:11] <@Ranryu692> call him Shinsuke Nakamura
[4:31:12] <%MonsterEnvy> I think I spotted a Mimikyu in the background
[4:31:13] <%masonschnee> Shinx can evo
[4:31:17] <hueley> Turned it into a plant
[4:31:18] <rasamune> A duck with a leek on its back
[4:31:21] <+PwnyB> @PwnyB Ah, interesting. I'm a little torn. While I think Pokemon has areas in battles where it needs to pick up the pace (and slow down) the capture will it/won't it I would have left in. Ah well lol
[4:31:25] <%RetroCop87> yo, that grass is glitching
[4:31:26] <+kewlmyc> Not going to lie, getting sold on this game. Too bad between KOFXV and Elden Ring, my gaming budget is shot.

[4:32:35] <%kainhighwind1990> @PatStaresAt do you think this game was made as like a proof of concept for like gen 9 or whatever?
[4:32:46] <antimatter_man> Love the luxray line. All of them.
[4:32:49] <jowi_time> yuuup
[4:32:49] <+kewlmyc> @Berendenn Outside of the environments being ass ugly, yeah. They're trying new stuff.

[4:32:51] <SulfurousAcid> you think that zubat knows supersonic
[4:32:54] <ohno58> I just wish there was an actual sphinx pokemon
[4:33:00] <Dunmarkh> @cpt_langosta shinx rhymes with lynx
[4:33:12] <+TaurusOxford> @antimatter_man Love the design. Typing and moveset are bad though. :(
[4:33:15] <%TerpanderLux> imagine this but with polish... Kreygasm
[4:33:19] <+mrjplays2k9> I used to hate zubat, but crobat is a top 5 pokemon
[4:33:32] <+CptCreampuff16> just bring megas back and pokemon will be great i need mega lopunny
[4:33:35] <DancesWitBalrog> Why is you red?
[4:33:36] <+charp35> If they keep this gameplay and improve the graphics gen 9 will be great
[4:33:41] <NickHatesSnow> main series usually ignore spinoff mechanics so im gonna stay pessamistic
[4:33:41] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Lets Go was the prototype for Gen 8, and XY had things Sun and Moon (Gen 7) had permanentyl
[4:33:42] <Dunmarkh> crobat is awesome
[4:33:44] <cpt_langosta> look at that MANE and that THIN TAIL. a dog. a GOOD DOG.
[4:33:51] <MESeele> How'd he get the mask??
[4:33:52] <+kewlmyc> Crobat is cool yeah.
[4:33:52] <hananafell> You broke its spine
[4:33:55] <%CopperTucker> @PatStaresAt check twitter I tagged you in a cat picture
[4:33:56] <%LastHazzerd> so when pokemon feint and their models shrink down they are ACTUALLY shrinking
[4:34:00] <%LastHazzerd> ?
[4:34:06] <Dunmarkh> @MESeele mystery gift
[4:34:15] <%doc_ock_rokc> PSYDUCK
[4:34:16] <%ShinobiPhoenix> XY was the last "traditional" Mon since GEn 3
[4:34:19] <CatRidder> you caught  a zubaz
[4:34:22] <Parapattern> Idiot Man
[4:34:23] <+ScrapKingKeita> Elec >Water
[4:34:26] <%notsoy> electric beats water
[4:34:27] <%MonsterEnvy> Elec beats Water
[4:34:28] <HotMafia81> Electricity good against water
[4:34:29] <%AgniBrandt> Electricity good against water
[4:34:29] <Jim_Placebo> electric good vs water
[4:34:30] <%TerpanderLux> elec good against water
[4:34:30] <tangowulf> Did the game get fun yet?
[4:34:30] <+TaurusOxford> electric beats water
[4:34:33] <+kewlmyc> Electric beats water
[4:34:35] <%AgniBrandt> Water neutral against elec
[4:34:36] <KnifeyMcEdge> alright FINE, I'll play a Pokemon game.
[4:34:37] <MESeele> @Dunmarkh Ah, thanks.
[4:34:38] <ohno58> you are about to be eaten by a psyduck
[4:34:38] <DianaTheAscian> elec beats water
[4:34:39] <Berendenn> wait can the pokemon kill the trainer?
[4:34:43] <EaseTheSquirrel> also you can't roll well in the water
[4:34:45] <%notsoy> electric does not resist water attacks, however
[4:34:45] <hueley> Elec beats water
[4:34:51] <%ShinobiPhoenix> you have iFrames if you start a battle before an attack can hit
[4:34:52] <Dunmarkh> electricity kills water
[4:34:56] <Profmcstevie> The wild pokemon will INDEED attack trainers
[4:34:56] <A_Windmill> true, basically no loading screens
[4:34:58] <%doc_ock_rokc> Psyduck the pat of pokemon
[4:35:00] <Pookiedaexzile> But Pat why don't you have this memorized from Years of only playing this one game
[4:35:01] <+ScrapKingKeita> they should have kept the gen 4 health bar speed
[4:35:03] <%notsoy> but grass does resist water attacks AND does double damage

[4:35:31] <cpt_langosta> oh no, not the electric doggo!
[4:35:52] <%MonsterEnvy> I think I spotted a Syther
[4:35:54] <+ScrapKingKeita> You're right, for an authentic proto Sinnoh vibe, it should be twice as long @notsoy

[4:37:39] <%optimasmaximas> no pat
[4:37:43] <%legendfather_of_giants> also water doesnt beat poison
[4:37:43] <%greasypete00> that's the fuckin steel type gym leader from gen 4
[4:37:46] <bigrocksalt> also water is NOT strong against poison
[4:37:48] <Daniel_Is_I> Evolves into a Barney-looking mofo
[4:37:52] <sulkcessor> fucking goomy hell yeah
[4:37:52] <%greasypete00> no wait I mean the ground guy from gen 5
[4:37:54] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Ice or Fairy and you have none
[4:38:05] <%ShinobiPhoenix> my Shinx has Ice Fang
[4:38:07] <hakumaribo> its a pseudo legendary
[4:38:08] <hueley> A fearsome dragon it is
[4:38:11] <Dunmarkh> evolves into a dragon with a fat ass
[4:38:41] <+ScrapKingKeita> ?????
[4:38:41] <%ShinobiPhoenix> he' not sleep
[4:38:42] <%TerpanderLux> :)
[4:38:43] <%Birdigalore> Yeah sleep works like paralysis in this game
[4:38:44] <+Zix_Serro> Drowsy is different than Asleep.
[4:38:45] <EaseTheSquirrel> nah it just has water moves because its a little goop dragon
[4:38:45] <%legendfather_of_giants> what?
[4:38:45] <grimwire1> his droswt
[4:38:47] <SivSarcast> Hey Pat how's it goin'
[4:38:47] <@Ranryu692> oh it's the cum dragon
[4:38:48] <%SveriSageAdvice> what the fuck??
[4:38:48] <BlazieTiger> Wow
[4:38:49] <hakumaribo> most likely has sleep talk
[4:38:50] <%ShinobiPhoenix> only DROWSY now
[4:38:50] <%MonsterEnvy> It's Drowsey not asleep quite yet
[4:38:50] <%doc_ock_rokc> he is DROZY not asleep
[4:38:50] <%MegadBlitz> he's dwozy he shweepy
[4:38:50] <EaseTheSquirrel> sleep doesn't exist in this game
[4:38:51] <+Zix_Serro> They have a chance to not act.
[4:38:52] <grimwire1> drowsy
[4:38:52] <SaintSalted> not asleep, drowsy
[4:38:52] <Dunmarkh> he is not asleep
[4:38:56] <%sonuke_draws> its drowsy
[4:38:57] <$TenguGemini> they changed how sleep works in this, there's drowsy now which is more like you just have a chance of failing to attack and take more damage
[4:39:00] <%SveriSageAdvice> Hypnosis always was instant sleep though
[4:39:01] <%optimasmaximas> like yawn
[4:39:01] <+ScrapKingKeita> COOMY
[4:39:01] <%ShinobiPhoenix> all status are nerfs
[4:39:02] <%legendfather_of_giants> it is tho
[4:39:03] <%lucasoptics> @Birdigalore That
[4:39:03] <%ShinobiPhoenix> nerfed
[4:39:04] <%tank7013> You can press plus to see effects
[4:39:07] <skagtheprinceofhell> It's getting sleepy not asleep
[4:39:07] <tjkillemup2> drowsy works next turn
[4:39:07] <%doc_ock_rokc> ITS A LONG STORY
[4:39:08] <%valriot> Cos he's goo
[4:39:09] <Foopoof> Coomy
[4:39:10] <HotMafia81> Evolved forms are very... drippy
[4:39:10] <%optimasmaximas> thats literally what it is
[4:39:10] <+Fep3> hes sleepwalking
[4:39:10] <hueley> Sleep doesn't exist in this game, its drowsey now
[4:39:11] <KnifeyMcEdge> Dragon Deez
[4:39:12] <%SveriSageAdvice> why does Hypnosis only cause drowsy now
[4:39:13] <%MegadBlitz> I'll fight you all
[4:39:15] <+rafaelba93> dragon cum?
[4:39:15] <%lucasoptics> @Birdigalore that's so dumb
[4:39:16] <%MegadBlitz> shut up
[4:39:16] <%cvp5127> gussy
[4:39:17] <@Ranryu692> plague probably likes it
[4:39:23] <%ShinobiPhoenix> statuses are nerfed AND removed after battle
[4:39:23] <%epide> pat look at its 3rd form thats what it is
[4:39:26] <+FingaLights> Just looked it up, it fits
[4:39:30] <%SaiyanShoto> Plague probably likes it
[4:39:36] <greenoni> They got rid of sleep replaced it with drowsy, it now works like paralysis
[4:39:41] <%notsoy> all your KO's pokemon are getting no XP btw
[4:39:48] <dan_g_v> gooey and sticky
[4:39:51] <+Fep3> coomy
[4:39:53] <%YakumoYomi> "Suck it", he says to the *** dragon
[4:39:57] <EaseTheSquirrel> how can this BE
[4:40:00] <karl_rex> this song
[4:40:02] <BlazieTiger> Ooooh the Eterna Forest remix
[4:40:04] <@Ranryu692> @PatStaresAt look up "Goodra" if you want to know why I called it a cum dragon lol
[4:40:04] <hueley> Drowsey decreases defense too
[4:40:07] <ohno58> simple math nerd
[4:40:12] <sheepysenka> devastating bros
[4:40:20] <cpt_langosta> did this bitch follow you all the way out there
[4:40:23] <IntrepidEye> God this whole stream is reminding me of those Pokemon minecraft streams. Only thing missing is the nicknames
[4:40:39] <%lucasoptics> Digging this music
[4:40:50] <%HiroTSK5> @doc_ock_rokc Clay in Pokemon B/W is supposed to be an oil-tycoon type and lian's a babby version of him
[4:40:53] <%W1nterTitan> Always has been
[4:40:54] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @PatStaresAt you can check types in battle with the Start button btw
[4:40:55] <+ScrapKingKeita> MonHun Stories 2 was a better story
[4:40:57] <twoah> So does rest only inflict drowsy status now? If so, snorlax is unstoppable
[4:41:00] <cpt_langosta> why this kid look like the guy from braid but more anime
[4:41:01] <EaseTheSquirrel> the rampage
[4:41:01] <%DovaDude29> Man, Irida looks  so lame

[4:41:20] <%cvp5127> thaks god
[4:41:22] <%ShinobiPhoenix> yes, it's a reminder
[4:41:23] <%MonsterEnvy> Irida I think looks fine.
[4:41:36] <%ShinobiPhoenix> you weren't taught it until now
[4:41:42] <%TerpanderLux> moon2BED
[4:41:50] <+polothegreatest> woolieSPICE was right about upsidedown chips woolieGASM
[4:41:55] <EaseTheSquirrel> so when someone dies, and they drop the items they drop a loot satchel, and you can send it back to them
