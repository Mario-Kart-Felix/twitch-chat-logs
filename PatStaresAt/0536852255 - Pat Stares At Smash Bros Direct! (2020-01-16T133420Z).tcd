[0:38:59] <Timurine> Oh look a mirror match

[0:39:10] <DrSthe1st> This party is anything but crazy in here
[0:39:11] <NanoHologuise> LEANING INTO THE JOKE DOESN'T MAKE SWORDIES BETTER SAKURAI
[0:39:11] <%InugamiTheHound> paige loves the bone sword if you know what I mean?
[0:39:12] <Shwepie> Yes they are bones. The bones that would have made you taller.
[0:39:12] <Star_Ranger> I'm the bone of my sword
[0:39:12] <mrjplays2k9> so it plays like a fire emblem character, okay
[0:39:14] <+spacehouse> All FE fans
[0:39:15] <Tennochief> this has to be a joke
[0:39:15] <NarcissistCactus> this is very cool :)

[0:39:25] <$ceriani1234> naw man, fuck waluigi, THIS IS WHAT THE GAME NEEDS
[0:39:25] <EpslionBear> its because they're made from dragons. ive never played im just guessing
[0:39:25] <JohnMack> Don't worry, there's still a chance they will announce the fighter pack 2's first character
[0:39:25] <cn_monoxide> I truly could not care less! This isn’t worth my time
[0:39:26] <%GarbageNirvana> Not even mad tbh
[0:39:26] <%BakiinPlaysStuff> I legitimately thought these were the same character
[0:39:27] <Meeeese> Honest question: Why don't they just make a fucking stand-alone Fire Emblem brawler game? Just take the code from smash and make a new game
[0:39:29] <+obscureanimeguy> Watch Dante get announced last minute
[0:39:29] <BunnyEmperor> most boring but obvious stage choice
[0:39:30] <Curtisharkness1997> what's the point of the sword character joke if you still add a fucking sword character????
[0:39:30] <+SommenRider> I fucking don't understand why Sakurai thinks this is unique or fun
[0:39:30] <Bustahhwulf> Dmc3 on switch guys moon2N
[0:39:30] <RubberFistFight> I just pointed in in Clemps chat that MK is getting similar treatment to this - instead of bringing in characters people want (cyber-ninjas, classics that got removed, etc), they're just shoving in more and more and more WB-licensed movie characters. They just announced the DC joker the other day, as if people would be fucking excited by it.
[0:39:31] <+Merhabi> deep in their hearts
[0:39:31] <%Cozy90> ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper

[0:40:08] <+legendfather_of_giants> max is fucking dead
[0:40:08] <Hentailovr> so you know how their excuse for it being another sword user is the fact that byleth has different weapons? I wonder what other sword user could've used the same fucing excuse
[0:40:13] <mrjplays2k9> its not a true combo because of DI

[0:42:57] <$Dreadlord134> Didn’t they say that all these dlc. Bars refs would be from games that haven’t had a character in smash before?
[0:42:57] <Curtisharkness1997> I wish I could see sakurai live reacting to everyone's disappointment
[0:42:57] <%dukenux> hes dead :(

[0:43:09] <%Kiiper> That just dorf
[0:43:10] <kingmorsluciscaelum> And the hunter within loses control
[0:43:11] <weirdmothgirl> Maybe we could just pretend Dante got in, and then not play the game so that nothing can prove our brains wrong
[0:43:12] <Yummy_Nukes> BOWSER NOOOOO
[0:43:12] <Soul_Intern> cool, i guess
[0:43:13] <Shwepie> Pat is just dead inside now.

[1:07:37] <optimasmaximas> @sendaar With how sakurai has spoke of not enjoying developing smash, then his statement about iwata and the switch, he’s forced himself to do this and now enjoys it knowing he’s honoring his friend
[1:07:39] <Milo_Oda> Thanks pat
[1:07:40] <JumbleJams> BUSTIN MAKES ME FEEL bad
[1:07:40] <%euronymooose> get all the coffee and red bull
[1:07:40] <%DesertPenguin> Hey Pat, instead of worry about controllers being charged, why don't you buy really long USB cables and keep them plugged in 24/7? Never have to worry about a charge and it's like classic gaming with a wired controller. Not the worst thing in the world.
[1:07:40] <%Conyst> you should play CV now to get the taste of FE out of your mouth

[1:15:09] <cureneckbeard> doomguy
[1:15:10] <caja_de_ojos> TERRY'S WAS AWSOME
[1:15:10] <Ghosthand246> JOKER MK11 go watch the trailer coward
[1:15:10] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Sage words
[1:15:10] <Yummy_Nukes> yep
[1:15:11] <%SilverFaustX> yup
[1:15:13] <%thegreatbambe> just reverse the order lol
[1:15:13] <+Zutrax> Honestly the MK11 Joker trailer that just released during the direct was more hype than this Smash Direct.
[1:15:14] <Avionn> any of the firstt 4 coulda been last
[1:15:15] <%RPG_CHICAGO> Max just saw it and was immediately rejuvenated
[1:15:15] <%segonian> it's true
[1:15:16] <dabeaminator> Obvious statement is true
[1:15:16] <%wydamn> Byleth really should have been 3rd.
[1:15:16] <+BossPlayerOG> speaking of joker, have you seen mk11 joker?
[1:15:17] <assfordayz> Terry was Hyope too
[1:15:19] <%iwishthiswasicq> I actually do agree, but it's not their problem if some dudes on the internet get their hopes up.
[1:15:22] <+Rolandknight> @AngriestPat hahaha most people woke up for nothing
[1:15:24] <+loukemia83> if Byleth was first no one would have bought the pass
[1:15:24] <%Load_Complete> This one was by far the worst one and they saved it for last.
[1:15:24] <+StrawberryPantsu> SIX MORE FIRE EMBLEM CHARACTERS BIG HYPE
[1:15:24] <M4eta> ANY OF THE OTHER SHOULD BE LAST
[1:15:24] <ahaegotrigger> we need more Fire emblem characters

[1:15:25] <iwa5h4ck3d> Scammed everyone LUL

[1:15:39] <+go4thekneez> Three Houses sold like 5 million copies get over it LUL
[1:15:39] <%segonian> or 7 or something...
[1:15:40] <%Theycallmenerf> Did the reveal already happen?
[1:15:40] <$ceriani1234> ey, you could watch the joker trailer?
[1:15:41] <Blackscience91> But I want people to buy the pass. so I must
[1:15:41] <majindusto> FUCKING HELL PAT
[1:15:41] <MajesticDoogle> Byleth is cool tho
[1:15:42] <JumbleJams> get that checked out maybe
[1:15:43] <cureneckbeard> apatSleep
[1:15:44] <Zedimonx5> Was this a scam or a hustle?
[1:15:44] <ShichiNoBushi> Probably would have been better to have this character first, though I think his/her game came out a little later than Joker's release.
[1:15:46] <%BallerSwagBro9k> THAT MEME ALMOST EXPLODED YOUR HEAD
[1:15:46] <ahaegotrigger> and not only more fire emblem chracters but specifically more fire emblem swordsman
[1:15:47] <+TaphexWin> Joker looks pretty good tho
[1:15:47] <assfordayz> WE did NOT see the NEW KIRBY
[1:15:51] <ShoMibu> Would of been better if they added Mr. X from residet evil.

[1:19:03] <%rumtumtugnutz> On twitter HOES MAD is trending.
[1:19:04] <%RPG_CHICAGO> YOU CAN'T SUFFER OR BE SAD IF YOU NEVER LIKED SMASH
[1:19:10] <Masamune195> we were all fools for hyping ourselves up and giving ourselves hope ...
[1:19:10] <+gustavozxd> Dirge of cerberus looks more fun than the direct
[1:19:14] <+ill_sage> is this all we get outta this
[1:19:14] <+sanhiei> what the hell was the pizza about?
[1:19:16] <%Psyramics> ROBOT HOUSE
[1:19:16] <Kiari13> LUL .
[1:19:17] <+TheJonCool> TBH I felt more disappointed with Hero but that's just me. They definitely should have left Joker last though

[1:19:20] <%Wynzler> If Dante isn't #1 announced I'm quitting Smash (except Pat's MOST HATED) for life
[1:19:23] <Fujiwara_92> Smash House
[1:19:24] <%dukenux> SLYTHERIN???
[1:19:25] <ProfessorLuigi> HUFFLEPUFF

[1:19:27] <%Wynzler> #1 announced for Pack 2 I mean
[1:19:29] <%Jhylla81> house of pancakes
[1:19:30] <%aishman> @AngriestPat I think this is the most Crazy Talk has hurt people in general.
[1:19:30] <dabeaminator> I'm convinced Sakurai did this as a spite move. He wants to stop working on Smash so he's sabotaging Fighter Pass 2.
[1:19:30] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> WE never stopped being mad
[1:19:31] <majindusto> I JUST WANTED KIRYU dudsHands

[1:21:06] <%dekkitout> So why isn't there a Fire Emblem fighting game like how there's Injustice?
[1:21:06] <%Jhylla81> My only real issue with Fire Emblem charcters in smash is for a game with a weapon wheel we get ALL sword users
[1:21:07] <bleugh> edelgard made it bros....
[1:21:07] <Fujiwara_92> THERE'S MORE FF THAN SWORDS monkaS

[1:21:28] <getinthetent> p o p u l a r
[1:21:30] <Fujiwara_92> BLYAT
[1:21:33] <%GarbageNirvana> Fire Emblem owes its Western popularity to Smash
[1:21:34] <+tweedler92> At least all of the 8 Pokémon play different
[1:21:37] <Ratsy_> you have:marth, big marth, red marth, girl marth, wizard marth, dragon marth, dad marth and now teacher marth
[1:21:40] <ItsYanniYan> it shouldve been claude
[1:21:41] <jorniev> and its always a sword guy
[1:21:42] <%ssjklyco> Female Byleth is the Canon character
[1:21:42] <Yummy_Nukes> OMG I LOVE SWORD MAN
[1:21:43] <%stoccton> marth the best
[1:21:44] <+acexclover> sfhTHINK
[1:21:46] <+NitronStreams> at least pokemon have unique designs
[1:21:47] <ahaegotrigger> True
[1:21:47] <tegas_> Any of the Lords would've been a looot better
[1:21:48] <Solidnick18> LUL
[1:21:48] <%GarbageNirvana> If it weren't for Smash people over here wouldn't even know what Fire Emblem is
[1:21:49] <%thegreatbambe> ROY ACTUALY SUCKS

[1:21:52] <theloganbrand> Roy was put in to promote his game
[1:21:52] <antyriku2> "nearly identical" they share like 2 normals

[1:21:55] <%iwishthiswasicq> Has a sword=nearly identical huh?
[1:21:55] <%wydamn> Roy has the Blazing Blade
[1:21:55] <Solidnick18> ike is alright

[1:21:56] <zaptar13> Swordsman with counter
[1:21:57] <bleugh> chrom... fuck it
[1:21:58] <+TheKanMan> Chrom is big marth
[1:21:58] <Xelhesia> ROY IS AN ACTUAL CLONE IN CANON
[1:21:59] <LivingLegacyVII> Roy is cool
[1:22:01] <AlteisenReiseZ> If it was Hector? Cool. If it was a 3 Lord System like Pokemon Trainer? Cool. Or AT LEAST A VILLIAN
[1:22:02] <%sshen> Byleth getting in after 6 months makes Sakurais excuse about Xenoblade 2 being too new for a rep a huge joke
[1:22:02] <roxas_heartplay> ROYS OUR BOI
[1:22:02] <not_twitter_rowan> "Nearly identical"
[1:22:04] <Kiari13> @antyriku2 no but ignore the facts because swords

[1:22:17] <tegas_> Byleth is a stump
[1:22:17] <RoldanDgr8> New DLC for FE3H
[1:22:17] <sjcodan> Corin more like corn
[1:22:18] <%Deano8817> YEAH SURE
[1:22:18] <%ShovelJustice21> Ike and robin at least play pretty different
[1:22:18] <geosspone> Roy was included to advertise Binding Blade. same for Ike, Corrin, and Byleth
[1:22:23] <roxas_heartplay> ROY
[1:22:25] <+DismalDavid> yeah

[1:22:35] <TurtlesAndTentacles> im glad people are disappointed
[1:22:35] <%iwishthiswasicq> Honestly, take Corrin and Lucina out.
[1:22:36] <+jiggy_snipe> Smash is an advertisement tool for Fire Emblem
[1:22:37] <kuningaz45> He's been having a bad night
[1:22:38] <%Quigsies> That would be fine
[1:22:38] <%segonian> Pat is right.
[1:22:38] <cheesedburgers> Out of all the fire emblem protags byleth is the lamest. Honest to god one of the most vapid playable characters in a video game
[1:22:40] <Fujiwara_92> NAH
[1:22:40] <Tha_Mik> I liked roy in melee

[1:22:45] <%SilverFaustX> feel bad? hes rich lol
[1:22:46] <icosahedralAPOI> The issue isn't Byleth themselves, it's that there's too many FE characters
[1:22:46] <Zer0beats> FIRE
[1:22:47] <Kiari13> people would be mad after any more fire emblems LUL

[1:22:56] <ProfessorLuigi> WHENS LYN??
[1:22:57] <+TaphexWin> Meanwhile Max is playing Dirge of Cerberus. Poor bastard.
[1:22:58] <ShichiNoBushi> Hector, please.
[1:22:59] <Cypher_Ranger_PhazON> The worst thing is you will learn nothing from or about Byleth by playing them.
[1:23:00] <Zer0beats> DRAGON
[1:23:01] <KinduVborrd> I love playing Lucina and Roy, but honestly they aren't necessary
[1:23:01] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> The Earth is still burning
[1:23:01] <ahaegotrigger> theyre all Fire Emblem Swordsman at that
[1:23:02] <Quietshun13> we got 6 more characters coming I aint mad
[1:23:02] <+Austinck> didn't u really like three houses
[1:23:02] <%Jhylla81> If they had a mix of weapon users from Fire Emblem I wouldn't care
[1:23:03] <%DarkLinkBJ> If only Chrom and Lucina were fancy outfit changes
[1:23:04] <%Birdigalore> EVERY FIRE EMBLEM IS HERE
[1:23:04] <AlteisenReiseZ> What if they switched between the three lords like pokemon trainer
[1:23:04] <+FOGSHIE> I love my blank slate JRPG protag, fuck you, pat! /s
[1:23:04] <+samsarasage> LYN

[1:23:10] <ProfessorLuigi> GIVE ME LYN THE BEST FE
[1:23:10] <%SirFancySwank> despite no sword he still sword character
[1:23:10] <Fear_Ranjer> YES EXACTLY
[1:23:11] <cureneckbeard> yeyeye
[1:23:11] <%SomeponysScribbles> Not a clone get your head out of your ass dude lol
[1:23:12] <Zedimonx5> Oops all gokus problem in FighterZ
[1:23:12] <%hntronium> tahts finw tbh
[1:23:12] <Kiari13> there are a lot of them in their own game, that's fine
[1:23:13] <dabeaminator> @AngriestPat they made a joke about sword characters, that means they're self aware RIGHT?
[1:23:13] <+TheKanMan> Byleth is not a clone, his whole final smash attack is just a JPG. No one has just a JPG as a final smash.
[1:23:14] <+TheJonCool> No one's upset about the character, they're upset about Fire Emblem
[1:23:14] <MajesticDoogle> because new characters are cool lol
[1:23:15] <+DismalDavid> pokemon are actually different
[1:23:15] <+tweedler92> 8 pokemans
[1:23:16] <maglebeast> Ah so we did already see the smash reveal
[1:23:17] <iwa5h4ck3d> Just go back in time 4Head

[1:23:18] <lovesosa236> just give me spiderman or something LUL
[1:23:18] <+Austinck> depends on which pokemon
[1:23:18] <Benperson> it feels like fire emblem X Mario now
[1:23:19] <ComradeChinx> We couldnt even get a new Xeno rep ResidentSleeper
[1:23:20] <alphonseisbest> I'd be good with that
[1:23:20] <%doc_ock_rokc> Oops all sword fire emblem
[1:23:21] <+ShadowForceX75> Pokemon is better
[1:23:22] <Streamitnot> There are now less Pokemon in the game than Fire Emblems
[1:23:22] <%duneblythe> I would love it
[1:23:22] <+angel949> *another link
[1:23:22] <hairtoday> the pokemon are at the least visually distinct
[1:23:23] <%hntronium> its ok
[1:23:23] <TurtlesAndTentacles> I'd love it
[1:23:23] <+ProfessorThorgi> Oh people would be way happier with Pokemon than Fire Emblem
[1:23:24] <+jiggy_snipe> exactly
[1:23:24] <HayabusaTaichou> People like pokemon more that FE.
[1:23:24] <Flarepulse> I was super worried we were gonna get a SwSh starter
[1:23:25] <Kiari13> @valkuma i do :)
[1:23:26] <tegas_> I wanna play Carkoal
[1:23:27] <%segonian> that would be fine.
[1:23:28] <rookeealding> they wouldn't do it... it takes too much time to animate pokemon.
[1:23:30] <theloganbrand> Sakurai already has to fight hard with game freak for what he gets
[1:23:31] <Fujiwara_92> JUST MAKE A FF FIGHTING GAME AT THIS POINT LUL
[1:23:32] <%thackattack00> Am I crazy or did Sakurai say that each character would be from a series that hadnt been represented yet? Like when Ultimate/the DLC was first announced?
[1:23:33] <ReDexuz> let me play as chandelure
[1:23:33] <ShichiNoBushi> Another trainer with a different set of starters.
[1:23:33] <%SoySocks> @AngriestPat and people would be mad at waluigi because he'd be the 8th mario character lol
[1:23:33] <%Ell1ot> Francis York Morgan for smash. His stage is the Milk Barn

[1:23:37] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> You wanted Mickey ////Mouse

[1:29:21] <Zedimonx5> Choese woke him up
[1:29:21] <ReRoute25> They're trying to reel in the FE people

[1:29:29] <artificiallynatural> Poor Matt Walker accidentally raised exectations only to dash it against a rock
[1:29:31] <+Zeghart> I don't even mind Fire Emblem characters but all they do is add the protagonist avatars that have zero personality, there are SO MANY better choices
[1:29:34] <%SilverFaustX> smash is a marketing tool for new dlc
[1:29:46] <+gustavozxd> that date coincidence was the worst thing to ever happen
[1:29:51] <%Jtf374> so how does everyone like Dante is in Smash?
[1:29:51] <Kiari13> hey pat are you doing anything immediately after this? @AngriestPat
[1:29:52] <paizurihokage> In the end I’m the hoe that’s mad
[1:29:56] <$joylent_blue> zeghart my thoughts exactly
[1:29:56] <%rumtumtugnutz> they should add Dante to Fire Emblem. then he's a shoe in for SmUsh.
[1:29:57] <%GalacticaPhanto> @angriestpat if you're doing all the RE games you can technically do DMC games as well
[1:30:00] <+luckydente> wait what happened
[1:30:00] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Not being mad is lame
[1:30:02] <%Aeoneth> No memes will be generated from this
