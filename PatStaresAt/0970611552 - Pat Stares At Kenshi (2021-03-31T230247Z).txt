[0:03:03] <heythatguy> To really enjoy the game you gotta grind to a heavy degree
[0:03:06] <%MidnightBurst12> I am ready for hours of confusion
[0:03:06] <aiutare47> I love Kenshi, but sometimes its not fun, and its definitely not for everyone
[0:03:08] <+glgzephyr> @abelincoln_catpuncher you should buy it

[0:03:44] <+RootVeggie> Kenshi is brutal
[0:03:50] <aiutare47> @OwlLightningMage does beep only spawn in Mongrel? Will chat convince Mr Pat to rush directly to Fog Islands?
[0:03:54] <%MidnightBurst12> Beep is eternal
[0:03:57] <%king_wragles> @crimsonharvest Just say "Listen, I know you want to cry but that's the fun of it!"

[0:28:22] <%shruke> working at taco bell a friend of mine used to list all the items in Super Mario RPG in order of how good they are.
[0:28:24] <KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt How about you that blindfolded, while Paige follows your directions on the game?

[0:35:09] <cheapdoc> I'm shocked they didn't transition sooner
[0:35:10] <%dekkitout> As a cis man, I am jelly
[0:35:14] <+OwlLightningMage> Warframe will never have the money it needs
[0:35:16] <@SSaryn> Also when you opening Loot Llamas on stream dummy.
[0:35:17] <worldbrand> as a warframe player, i wish DE had the chops to keep things that polished
[0:35:17] <$dalmek> it's a cellar-doorism

[0:36:00] <+OwlLightningMage> DOG WATER WutFace
[0:36:00] <spicyramengaming> Warframe needs a competent team that listens to the community and actually tries to improve the game, not more money thrown at them.
[0:36:00] <thepardack> dammit gief

[0:37:14] <Siconia> Like bu miles
[0:37:15] <marvel877> As of today, both my parents got their 2 shots.
[0:37:16] <+wizard_of_diamonds> I prefer the Noble Dwarf, but due to personal bias
[0:37:17] <%Landralin1996> Human noble is fine but generic as hell
[0:37:23] <+OwlLightningMage> The Dwarf ones are actually the best
[0:37:24] <aiutare47> Dont you want to be a forest elf jacking themselves off in a ruin?
[0:37:27] <%goose_attack_almanac> IT CHANGES PERSPECTIVE BASED ON GENDER
[0:37:29] <cheapdoc> shame mage is the best class
[0:37:31] <Brandon__Brando> ok I got to replay that I remamber not liking it
[0:37:31] <karovus> that opening is SO good it hurts
[0:37:34] <BliVru> best one is mage
[0:37:34] <%kyh9> Human Noble is generic as fuck
[0:37:36] <%moonmintparadise> Yeah it's great !
[0:37:42] <%actual_scum> Have you installed any mods for Kenshi?
[0:37:44] <+allups> what game u talkign about?>
[0:37:45] <CatRidder> good?
[0:37:46] <$Afterman_> just a reminder. you have to wait 14 days after your 2nd shot to be fully vaccinated. if you get the 1 series shot it is a 28 day wait for full protection
[0:37:46] <%Alazull> Dwarf Slum dweller was a power gapped second place
[0:37:48] <T_Sasquatch> Dissidia ?
[0:37:50] <+pectusumbra> O
[0:37:54] <+pectusumbra> Wait sorry what
[0:37:54] <+chernobyl_hobo> What game is he talking about?
[0:37:55] <BliVru> oof
[0:37:57] <+allups> what game he talking about?
[0:37:59] <kingmemelord97> Wait what game ?
[0:37:59] <+OwlLightningMage> The Dwarf ones are the best
[0:38:01] <%MidnightBurst12> write a bioware
[0:38:05] <%DukeMoose> oh yea that one
[0:38:06] <%moonmintparadise> Human noble sucks, elf city all the way
[0:38:07] <cherrycottontail> Sounds like dragon age but it's not?
[0:38:09] <%cvp5127> they're probably gone
[0:38:10] <LoneFonte> Dragon Age:Origins, chat
[0:38:12] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> city elf origin was so legit
[0:38:13] <Siconia> It's like the huge ass gap between the Dark Knight class quests and EVERY OTHER CLASS
[0:38:13] <cherrycottontail> Oh yeah
[0:38:17] <karovus> my first char was an elf mage i barely missed it first time
[0:38:18] <T_Sasquatch> Ohhh
[0:38:18] <Brandon__Brando> @kyh9 its the worst one its why I havent played as a human
[0:38:19] <%DukeMoose> and forest elf
[0:38:19] <+allups> FUCK OFF IF JUST STARTED THIS GAME NO SPPILERS
[0:38:21] <+pectusumbra> ah, dragon age origins, got ya
[0:38:22] <+Troispoint> DA Origins was really good, but too long.
[0:38:25] <Broken_Sonex> Ohhh, yeah, the City Elf one is FUCKED
[0:38:25] <aiutare47> BIG racism
[0:38:28] <cherrycottontail> dragon age is bioware, they did write at bioware
[0:38:37] <T_Sasquatch> As they should be
[0:38:39] <%dekkitout> Elves? Second class? Wild...
[0:38:40] <Aydarkzero> oh...
[0:38:42] <Brandon__Brando> @allups its the first hour
[0:38:43] <Siconia> YAUP
[0:38:46] <%kyh9> It’s the only time that game is dark
[0:38:47] <maskedmook> I need to replay DA Origins
[0:38:48] <cheapdoc> And then it's like rain- ain on your wedding day
[0:38:48] <%Dunmarkh> wtf
[0:38:49] <%SirGO0SE> um
[0:38:49] <+wolfofsound> so the english
[0:38:51] <%dekkitout> Pelinal would be proud
[0:38:53] <%walternatorz> PRIMA NOCTA
[0:39:03] <+chiazam> Oh fuck wow
[0:39:08] <%shurtal> NO SUCH THING AS TOO STRONGLY
[0:39:09] <aiutare47> you didnt solve it strong ENOUGH
[0:39:11] <+GrandmasterBFunk> The Dota Anime made Elves Australian for some reason.
[0:39:12] <$Afterman_> pelinal is inspired lol
[0:39:12] <+seoliart> Yep
[0:39:13] <%JoshManVGH> The Male City elf has one of those "killem" conversation buttons vs a goon, and it's fucking great.
[0:39:14] <Siconia> Dragon Age Origins was so good at building the tension between races
[0:39:18] <GarbageNirvana> And either way Duncan's like "Well, you're fucked here, wanna tag along with us?"
[0:39:19] <yourliteraldog> Nobles suck ass
[0:39:21] <Siconia> FAMBLY
[0:39:21] <%goose_attack_almanac> But you didn't solve it in time. Because your cousin still gets... the brunt of it
[0:39:21] <+OwlLightningMage> The dawrf ones are the best
[0:39:25] <TheSphereHunter> Moi Fembly
[0:39:26] <TheLucidChiba> Dwarf noble was pretty interesting
[0:39:26] <+wizard_of_diamonds> I'm not sure I can agree. Both Dwarf and Forest Elf are pretty dark
[0:39:26] <%moonmintparadise> Yeah Origins was DARK Fantasy.
[0:39:27] <karovus> he just rolls in and goes "i need some whores" and takes all the hot ones
[0:39:27] <+pectusumbra> damn, that actually sounds cool
[0:39:33] <%Valdorick> Then Dragon Age 2 was "You're Fantasy Sheperd!"
[0:39:35] <%kyh9> It’s the best part of that game
[0:39:37] <%moonmintparadise> Remember Dark Spawn Wives ?
[0:39:38] <Ekaelis> Thats almost unreasonably dark
[0:39:38] <+chiazam> What game is this?
[0:39:41] <Brandon__Brando> the mage one is the worst
[0:39:42] <BliVru> maaan is Earl evil?
[0:39:42] <cherrycottontail> oh no, i have rich person problems
[0:39:43] <SubliminaIMessages> I kill everyone as the female elf every time lol
[0:39:43] <CatRidder> yeah fuck homans
[0:39:45] <%JoshManVGH> Mage was cool
[0:39:47] <SovPho> oh kenshi woo this game is
[0:39:49] <+AgentApe0> What about that crime dwarf tho
[0:39:50] <%DukeMoose> i liked Noble dwarf the most, because out of EVERYONE its your traitor brother that still calls you family.
[0:39:52] <+OwlLightningMage> Pat wrong
[0:39:52] <Fien111> And then Duncan kills Ser Jory because Jory didn't want to die pointless on a dice roll of if he survives the poison.....Fuck Duncan
[0:39:53] <%Alazull> Again, Dwarf Lowborn is interesting
[0:39:54] <SovPho> super tedious
[0:39:56] <+Hyphixsys> I like how you think Pat: "Who gives a shit!" Kappa
[0:39:57] <%BinaryFireball> oh noooo I wont become super rich and powerful oooooh nooooo
[0:39:58] <dragoon001914> Dalish Elf was the worst
[0:39:59] <Siconia> The City Elf start is dark but not grossly edgy
[0:39:59] <+OwlLightningMage> Mage was cool
[0:39:59] <+FollowDatDolphin> the slum dwarf origin was pretty cool. basically had to crime your ways up to the surface
[0:40:00] <karovus> wild elf fucking sucks
[0:40:04] <Brandon__Brando> I miss dragon age
[0:40:06] <yourliteraldog> Nobility is just next level Nepotism
[0:40:10] <%GarbageNirvana> Imagine if that Game of Thrones RPG was able to hit Dragon Age: Origins levels
[0:40:12] <$Afterman_> no no
[0:40:12] <+allups> @Brandon__Brando i started as a dwarf tho. its fine tho old game is old
[0:40:12] <Aydarkzero> wut
[0:40:16] <+Hyphixsys> LUL
[0:40:16] <+AgentApe0> Crime Dwarf!

[0:40:17] <BliVru> Bhelen is a hero prove me wrong!!
[0:40:19] <cheapdoc> You have a bandana?
[0:40:19] <+wolfofsound> No that sounds cool as shit
[0:40:19] <%MidnightBurst12> the only thing good about the human noble start is that you have the dog from the beginning
[0:40:21] <%Jekado> I CAN'T WAIT to see that trashfire of a movie
[0:40:22] <SomersaultJustice> that movie has lu bu, which makes it the best movie
[0:40:22] <$Afterman_> go look it up
[0:40:22] <%BinaryFireball> isn't that just 3 kingdoms?
[0:40:23] <+OwlLightningMage> Dalish Elf is the worst one
[0:40:24] <%machshop> that reminds me the Monster Hunter movie is straight trash
[0:40:24] <%Mothman007> You can be a real Piece of SHIT in the Dwarf Noble Start
[0:40:26] <%moonmintparadise> big boy

[0:58:05] <shinichizio> ARG! Skeletons!
[0:58:06] <%BoxNavy> "what do i do"
[0:58:06] <+WizoSavage> Get money, survive
[0:58:08] <DSD24> I only know about this game cause Sseth did a video on it
[0:58:14] <%crimsonharvest> First goals are probably make some money and get a companion that can heal naturally.
[0:58:15] <LoneFonte> @ZeOrbling wanderer
[0:58:16] <+projectmanatees> What backstory did he choose
[0:58:17] <reddpop_> HOW DO WE CRANK A FAT 90 IN THIS ONE

[0:58:21] <ChungusQuest> oh fuck, individual body part HP
[0:58:25] <Shinny1338> lol welcome to Kenshi man. It basically the old Open RPGs from Broadwars days
[0:58:27] <Slimshazbot> Streaming your first time with this game is gonna be rough, fair warning.
[0:58:28] <%ZeludeRose> this game is made for 5 crazy people and those 5 crazy people think it's the best thing ever made
[0:58:29] <DSD24> Look at that fast lad

[0:58:37] <cheapdoc> Not gonna lie, this kindda sucks
[0:58:38] <Jerp> BliVru RTS -- "real-time suffering". hardship simulator
[0:58:42] <%blastyoboots> "HUARGH! Skeletons!"
[0:58:47] <+el_hearto> @ZeludeRose Crazy guy here, it is
[0:58:49] <+OwlLightningMage> Pat is gonna fucking die
[0:58:49] <%machshop> oil is blood
[0:58:50] <+Kitrane> Gotta love how "Now you exist, go do shit, fuck you I'm not gonna make things visually easy" this game is
[0:59:01] <+Despera__> @BinaryFireball depends on how you play it
[0:59:07] <+allups> u base build in this shit too god damn
[0:59:12] <BliVru> CLICK ON HIM
[0:59:15] <ChungusQuest> so it's basically Fortnite, got it
[0:59:16] <Shinny1338> I forgot how bad the original UI is
[0:59:17] <%Teintstein> @cheapdoc at least give it a chance he literally just exited the character creator
[0:59:18] <shinichizio> Found the Build menu frame 1, amazing
[0:59:20] <%MidnightBurst12> not gonna be a thing for a while
[0:59:23] <%ChaosVulpes> psaGoblin
[0:59:26] <+TheMorilo> just sell drugs
[0:59:27] <%crimsonharvest> Build, Kenshi is a colony sim if you want it to be. Build a settlement and teching up is a thing.
[0:59:27] <DSD24> Figure things out dumbasses
[0:59:27] <+Despera__> I love this game, feels like playing Morrowind when I was 12
[0:59:29] <%Teintstein> world is psaBig
[0:59:36] <+seoliart> Kenshi's map is pretty massive
[0:59:36] <mike2hands> time for explorning
[0:59:39] <TheA1ternative> The hub
[0:59:40] <lambishly> The Hub
[0:59:41] <%BoxNavy> this is going to be a good stream
[0:59:41] <+allups> ber a robot hooker
[0:59:41] <+coolthulhuu> the hub
[0:59:43] <%GarbageNirvana> Go mine rocks for twenty hours
[0:59:44] <bonebagMEL> the map is bigger than it looks
[0:59:45] <+el_hearto> the blue dot
[0:59:45] <+messentry> the goblins are gonna kill that so fast

[0:59:49] <+alpharius88> THE HUD
[0:59:50] <TheA1ternative> bottom left you can center to character
[0:59:52] <+redthebaron> The map is impressive
[0:59:54] <%delilah4you> I havent even played this and *I'm* bouncing off it
[0:59:54] <%Teintstein> you're a wee lil dot
[0:59:55] <+Huderga> Sell narcotics
[0:59:55] <balthazar758> @despera__ first thing that popped in my mind too
[0:59:58] <+Kitrane> First time I played I had no fucking clue and ended up a quadriplegic eating bandit legs wearing nothing.
[0:59:59] <1000_buffers> wtf is this runescape shit? i thought there'd be ninjas @PatStaresAt
[1:00:02] <lambishly> Kenshi's map is HUGE
[1:00:04] <Broken_Sonex> Yeah this game is very "Fuck you, make a story." kinda game
[1:00:06] <Shinny1338> Blue dot
[1:00:14] <SpaceManHotepIV> sing is such a cool little dude
[1:00:16] <+allups> @delilah4you LUL

[1:00:18] <Siconia> That's the goal, buy dog
[1:00:28] <%DukeMoose> Congratulations Pat. your skills are lvl 1. Just about everyone around you, are lvl 10-15
[1:00:29] <%BinaryFireball> theres a bar
[1:00:29] <shinichizio> "Remember: You're not special." A phrase you see when the dev chooses violence
[1:00:33] <+Monkeydude07> ETA until wipe
[1:00:33] <TheA1ternative> might wanna exit the build menu for now
[1:00:35] <Slimshazbot> This is a "do you goddamn research before you play" sorta game so I am very glad pat seems like he's going in blind :V
[1:00:45] <+Peterbyte_> Don't worry about building just yet
[1:00:45] <+HexForest> You don't need to build for a while
[1:00:45] <blackbaron98> no materials
[1:00:46] <+Danpai_> Get out of that build menu son, you won't need that for at least a month and a half
[1:00:49] <+HexForest> You aren't rich enough to own land
[1:00:52] <%Teintstein> having the build tutorial trigger on load is very ambitious
[1:00:53] <+Kitrane> also fuck the Raptors or ostriches or whatever those two legged monster bastards are. ate my face multiple times
[1:00:53] <+Despera__> BASE BUILDING!
[1:00:54] <TheA1ternative> there we are
[1:00:55] <rosysyntax> 20mins til first death
[1:00:58] <%BoxNavy> oh boy...
[1:01:02] <LunarRemix> Yeah this game isn't one for jumping in blind
[1:01:03] <%Dunmarkh> ADVENTURE, HUZZAH
[1:01:05] <BliVru> @PatStaresAt Don't woory about building until endgame
[1:01:06] <%BinaryFireball> go to bar
[1:01:06] <+Veraverse> What's goin on
[1:01:07] <+Hyphixsys> LUL
[1:01:07] <+Huderga> oh boy
[1:01:08] <+HexForest> All you have to build for like 10 hours is a sleeping bag
[1:01:08] <+OwlLightningMage> You aren't rich or strong enough to own land
[1:01:08] <smagloooshy> Ignore building for a good while
[1:01:11] <$Dakuu75> Ah yes, the "No man's sky" plan of "You can do anything!", "but... but, what do I do though?", "ANYTHING~!"
[1:01:11] <TheA1ternative> you can do it pat I believe
[1:01:12] <masterfire23> this reminds me of when pat tried subnautica
[1:01:13] <+Hyphixsys> have fun Pat Kappa
[1:01:14] <Shinny1338> @danpai_ Jesus you're right
[1:01:15] <%Teintstein> LUL
[1:01:16] <+Huderga> already broken
[1:01:17] <+Pilzkun> O god Pat, this game has so much shit in it.

[1:01:18] <SpaceManHotepIV> LUL
[1:01:18] <%redthebaron> yeah that is right pat

[1:01:20] <T_Sasquatch> I can hear Pat cracking
[1:01:20] <BliVru> Press alt
[1:01:23] <akareynolds88> its only gonna get more complicated pat
[1:01:24] <Typical1saac> overwhelmed?
[1:01:25] <+Solutha> explore pat
[1:01:28] <+el_hearto> The journey begins
[1:01:28] <+OwlLightningMage> This is the exact reaction I wanted LUL
[1:01:29] <Siconia> Pat is TV static
[1:01:29] <Slimshazbot> @PatStaresAt No offense, but did you seriously go in blind on Kenshi?
[1:01:33] <%orphan_ash> lord this looks stressful to me LUL
[1:01:33] <danpc5> you should have watched Sseth's review of this first lol
[1:01:33] <Broken_Sonex> Uhhhhhhh....I don't.....underst..........
[1:01:34] <lambishly> LUL I can see the smoke coming out of his ears
[1:01:34] <whatatkins> Welcome to DEEP
[1:01:35] <shubachi> this game seems crazy obtuse
[1:01:36] <%SirGO0SE> nice
[1:01:37] <huskarl_zap> find a ore vein mine it and sell it dont die
[1:01:37] <DSD24> Well you are a skeleton so Iguess you don't need to eat?
[1:01:37] <BliVru> Hold alt Imean sorry
[1:01:39] <%crimsonharvest> If you get into trouble with enemies outside run towards town guards or inhabited buildings.
[1:01:40] <+allups> u a kid cant be in here
[1:01:41] <+Veraverse> Pat's dying
[1:01:44] <+Sleepy_Puma> is this vanilla or modded?
[1:01:49] <+TheMorilo> This is a true game
[1:01:51] <+Pilzkun> @shubachi it is lol
[1:01:53] <+coolthulhuu> vanilla
[1:01:54] <digarak> Get ready for the most sandbox sandbox
[1:01:55] <BTR_NOODLE> pvpS
[1:01:56] <CurrySauseBandit> @slimshazbot It's more, explore and fail or take it slow read and learn. Blind was fun for me.
[1:01:57] <Slimshazbot> @Sleepy_Puma looks vanilla
[1:02:00] <LoneFonte> @Sleepy_Puma vanilla, first time
[1:02:00] <%Teintstein> @Sleepy_Puma vanilla, no mods that I saw when he started
[1:02:01] <+Pilzkun> this is the definition of sandbox
[1:02:02] <TheA1ternative> @Sleepy_Puma vanilla is he's new to the game
[1:02:04] <%dekkitout> Always ask if it's okay to steal, kids
[1:02:04] <blackbaron98> Become theif
[1:02:04] <Zayasu> is this an online game?
[1:02:04] <1000_buffers> throw a drink on him
[1:02:05] <$Dakuu75> gonna die, trying to steal a fucking spoon. lol
[1:02:07] <+Kitrane> It took me using a 6 hour Kenshi youtube guide to get anywhere near piddly basic proficiency on this game XD
[1:02:08] <$Dakuu75> LKMAO
[1:02:09] <+Hyphixsys> LUL LUL
[1:02:09] <%SirGO0SE> oh man hes going to die so fast
[1:02:09] <+Sleepy_Puma> oof
[1:02:11] <CursedNobleman> what is this? fancy skyrim? LUL
[1:02:13] <JetpackMcQuack> Start a fight PogChamp
[1:02:14] <+Sleepy_Puma> vanilla rough
[1:02:15] <%ssjklyco> This looks like a PC game that may get a PS1 port back in 2000s
[1:02:15] <+Despera__> Just play it like you're playing morrowind but ignoring the main story
[1:02:16] <smagloooshy> LUL
[1:02:17] <%DukeMoose> also the towns are occasionally assaulted by bandits.
[1:02:21] <Slimshazbot> @CurrySauseBandit For sure, but you weren't streaming it :V
[1:02:32] <aiutare47> @PatStaresAt so you know how open world rpgs prevent you from entering locations too soon by spawning very high level enemies? Thats every location in Kenshi. Keep in mind you will lose 90% of all fights.
[1:02:34] <%Teintstein> can't wait for him to get beaten and thrown out of town
[1:02:34] <CurrySauseBandit> @slimshazbot True.
[1:02:41] <%crimsonharvest> At high sneak you can pull it off in a crowded room like this
[1:02:42] <%BinaryFireball> talk to some dudes?
[1:02:44] <+OwlLightningMage> This is super vanilla. Pat has never played this before
[1:02:45] <TheA1ternative> dw about jobs for now
[1:02:45] <shubachi> the shear number of tutorial message boxes is giving me anxiety
[1:02:45] <$Dakuu75> OMFG, I can't breathe.... Pat just goes *sneak* and a MILLION RED ARROWS popped up. hahahaha
[1:02:46] <+projectmanatees> Wonder if we will see the Sunday mercenaries
[1:02:51] <+HexForest> You're selecting default actions
[1:02:51] <%Landralin1996> Jobs are for later
[1:02:54] <%GarbageNirvana> that's actually a good way to make money early on, wait for some bandits to try to rape the town and then when the guards kill them all loot them for their shit and sell it
[1:02:56] <+Despera__> You should save
[1:02:58] <smagloooshy> Pat if you ever get in a fight, just run back to town and the guards will save you LUL
[1:02:59] <+HexForest> Jobs is a custom one you set up later when you want to automate things
[1:03:01] <%DukeMoose> Jobs are for when you have a SUPPLY CHAIN of work queue'd up
[1:03:02] <TheA1ternative> literally dont worry about jobs for now thats for automation like "auto farm/mine/defend"
[1:03:03] <%GarbageNirvana> raid the town God damn it
[1:03:04] <+allups> this game is giving me headache
[1:03:07] <%BoxNavy> arf
[1:03:09] <%SirGO0SE> RE Inventory PogChamp
[1:03:09] <DSD24> Yooo all tgese weapons
[1:03:13] <+OwlLightningMage> I'm excited for this character to fucking die
[1:03:16] <%redthebaron> buy food
[1:03:21] <+Hyphixsys> LUL
[1:03:23] <%GarbageNirvana> fucking speech to text
[1:03:25] <$RealThiele> broke-ass
[1:03:25] <+HexForest> Kenshi's learning curve is a cliff
[1:03:25] <BliVru> Dont worry men we've all being here
[1:03:26] <+Kitrane> maybe of he is lucky he'll end up beaten by the imperial dides and thrown in slavery mines. better than being eaten by the worms
[1:03:28] <+allups> howd u even end up here
[1:03:28] <+HexForest> Climb it or die
[1:03:30] <thenewtypemyth> no idea m8
[1:03:33] <%Ziegsy> why does a skeleton need food?
[1:03:34] <%crimsonharvest> At the start you're probably going to be a scavenger and maybe do some mining to get cash. Mining requires no tools.
[1:03:35] <Broken_Sonex> Uhhhh......i don't.........B A R.....

[1:05:05] <blackbaron98> its like sims
[1:05:05] <+seoliart> WELCOME TO JANK CITY BABY
[1:05:06] <Ekaelis> Because you will often have multiple people on different floors
[1:05:06] <lambishly> Welcome to Kenshi baby
[1:05:07] <+Monkeydude07> game is optimized for multiple characters
[1:05:08] <+OwlLightningMage> LITERALLY MADE BY ONE GUY
[1:05:09] <%heartlesshealer> ENJOY
[1:05:10] <+saltpiggu> you love it
[1:05:10] <%Teintstein> welcome to the C R U S T
[1:05:10] <%Dunmarkh> It works better when you have 60 people in your party
[1:05:11] <%crimsonharvest> Game good but very indie
[1:05:11] <%asgard147> Welcome to Kenshi
[1:05:11] <AlexandusLordOfChaos> this game's legendary
[1:05:13] <CurrySauseBandit> You'll see later.
[1:05:13] <+Sleepy_Puma> Because Kenshi
[1:05:15] <+HexForest> I think in the options the dev straight up admits the controls are bad and it's just how it is
[1:05:15] <%moonmintparadise> this took like a decade to make
[1:05:16] <balthazar758> some programming jank, for sure
[1:05:16] <Noponiz> because you dont have 1 character later
[1:05:16] <bonebagMEL> This is like dwarf fortress, in a way
[1:05:17] <+yukichocomilk> this game looks like trash LUL
[1:05:17] <DSD24> Do I need a spreadsheet for this game?
[1:05:17] <smagloooshy> it's like the sims LUL
[1:05:18] <Aydarkzero> they got two swords monkaS
[1:05:19] <+coolthulhuu> youll also be controlling multiplew characters on different floors
[1:05:21] <CursedNobleman> LITERALLY DROWNING IN JANK
[1:05:23] <%DukeMoose> pat ONE GUY made this, for years.
[1:05:24] <%BinaryFireball> ADVENTURE HO!
[1:05:24] <+OwlLightningMage> It's also an RTS rpg
[1:05:26] <gslayer14> you're alone up there
[1:05:28] <gslayer14> steal shit
[1:05:29] <%metalicblackcherry> dev make game their way
[1:05:29] <%Landralin1996> I'm reinstalling Kenshi rn, this is getting me hyped

[1:05:33] <+tuchpi> this game is so good PogChamp
[1:05:33] <+allups> ull*

[1:05:33] <LoneFonte> having fun yet?
[1:05:33] <Shinny1338> Seeing this is making me laugh nervously that I've put hundreds of hours into this game
[1:05:34] <+triumphantapostle> have a nice friendly chat with the bar patrons
[1:05:39] <%Dunmarkh> talk to people in the bar
[1:05:39] <BliVru> Oh and it doesnt automatically go down by the way
[1:05:40] <+Danpai_> God, this is making me miss Kenshi
[1:05:41] <+impressionistcowboy> YO PAT WHEN IS THE DWARF FORTRESS STREAM
[1:05:43] <JetpackMcQuack> Context clicks are a 3 man feature
[1:05:43] <+Kitrane> Once you know what you are doing it's actually a pretty interesting game. it just takes you about 50 deaths and a few days of mental and emotional breakdown
[1:05:43] <%BinaryFireball> steal or go to mine?
[1:05:43] <+ReallyBigRocks> Page Up and Page Down change floors
[1:05:45] <cheapdoc> No music NONE AT ALL
[1:05:45] <+OwlLightningMage> You can explore, trade, mine, fight, talk
[1:05:45] <+Hyphixsys> LUL
[1:05:47] <GoingberzerkII> once you understand the game you get sucked into it
[1:05:48] <MrFlugaFluga> leav town kill a guy
[1:05:51] <%GarbageNirvana> this is an extremely one guy game
[1:05:53] <%BoxNavy> i can... see why chat wanted him to play this...?
[1:05:59] <Slimshazbot> I love how half the chat is like "psssh game sucks go back to fortnite" and half the chat is "FUCK YEAH KENSHI LETS GO"
[1:06:00] <CurrySauseBandit> @balthazar758 Nah it's on purpose. Once you get more cjaracters running around, you'll see the reasoning.
[1:06:00] <+OwlLightningMage> LUL
[1:06:02] <aiutare47> you havent even seen combat yet Pat, the jank is only begining
[1:06:07] <BliVru> Got to squin there's a free NPC to recruit

[1:06:28] <%Reaped_Psyche> Oh jesus Pat is playing Kenshi!?
[1:06:31] <+projectmanatees> Doesn’t this game borrow stuff from def jam?
[1:06:31] <Shinny1338> going to squin is a good idea
[1:06:32] <%walternatorz> who convinced Pat to play this? this is torture to pat
[1:06:33] <%metalicblackcherry> there may be a free npc to recruit around here or not
[1:06:33] <%SirGO0SE> this is my favorite version of Pat. Bewildered and confused
[1:06:35] <+HexForest> Check the keys to highlight names
[1:06:36] <TheA1ternative> not always a free npc
[1:06:38] <studleydoorite> why do other games even exist
[1:06:38] <+impressionistcowboy> lol isn

[1:06:44] <Broken_Sonex> .........How do you.......do anything? Where do you begin?
[1:06:44] <+Kitrane> theres usually a guard training area in the starter town that you can train your strength and DeX at
[1:06:44] <BliVru> The other city
[1:06:45] <+razielhex> cats?

[1:06:51] <+HexForest> The free guy shows up randomly
[1:06:51] <%Arancet> what is with this metal toddler running around?
[1:06:51] <+impressionistcowboy> isn't this the game where if you fuck up you become a slave?
[1:06:53] <greytiziocaio> in another city
[1:06:53] <+OwlLightningMage> No one is free in here
[1:06:58] <balthazar758> @currysausebandit i see, thanks man

[1:07:21] <LoneFonte> ADVENTURE. AWAITS.
[1:07:22] <+Hyphixsys> you can do this Pat
[1:07:24] <Slimshazbot> @impressionistcowboy In some cases, becoming a slave in this game can work out well for you.

[1:12:31] <Slimshazbot> @PatStaresAt Just wanna say for future reference, you will most likely lose your first fight. maybe even your fist couple fights. But getting beaten up increases your "toughness" stat, so getting your ass beat is a vital part of the experience.

[1:14:54] <+theGhastlyVisage> iddBlank
[1:14:54] <cherrycottontail> Directions: quit and start disco elysium
[1:14:54] <+Solutha> go get into a fight
[1:14:55] <DecoyBlackmage> the animals are going to murder him
[1:14:55] <+Xalgar> this is going to be a good ass stream
[1:14:56] <Luizabd> You can click inside the map
[1:14:57] <+OwlLightningMage> You can click on the big map to move
[1:14:57] <%Broand> Just walk the long and winding roaat
[1:14:58] <+ReallyBigRocks> landmarks I guess
[1:14:58] <%BoxNavy> @glgzephyr this game is anti-human
[1:15:02] <Slimshazbot> @PatStaresAt Not to knock you, but did you do ANY research on this beforehand? This game's learning curve is brutally steep, it's like streaming your first time playing Dwarf Fortress.
[1:15:02] <ullyzeez> @ssjklyco LUL
[1:15:04] <%Archphronimos> you have to make your own goals. I would recommend just exploring to begin with.
[1:15:05] <Broken_Sonex> @PatStaresAt I think......i think further research is required.
[1:15:05] <%redthebaron> @PatStaresAt you can click on the map to tell to go there
[1:15:07] <Shinny1338> you can click on the map itself
[1:15:10] <+OwlLightningMage> YOU CAN CLICK ON THE BIG MAP TO MOVE TO A POINT
[1:15:11] <$RealThiele> council of smooth goblins in session
[1:15:13] <+Pequod1> find and join the ninjas!!
[1:15:13] <%DukeMoose> Starting stuff? Maybe hiring more dudes, or mining copper and iron. From rocks along the roads
[1:15:15] <smagloooshy> @patstaresat As you play the game you make your own objectives, just explore
[1:15:19] <+glgzephyr> @BoxNavy Anti-Spiral, even
[1:15:24] <%dekkitout> Now would be an excellent time to play Big Iron
[1:15:25] <iq_dropper> Show some animals the power of your God Hand
[1:15:27] <+HexForest> Man this is the exact experience I remember having when I started Kenshi
[1:15:27] <+Double_negative> First goal, get money to get some gear other than a rusty pipe.
[1:15:28] <BliVru> @PatStaresAt You can right click on any location in the world map to go there
[1:15:29] <greytiziocaio> Keep in mind that templars REALLY HATE SKELETONS
[1:15:30] <%Monkeyweed21> wtf is this game
[1:15:31] <%DukeMoose> oh and wrong way to the shack
[1:15:36] <+glgzephyr> BAR
[1:15:39] <+triumphantapostle> dont be sad when you inevitably get the shit beaten out of you btw
[1:15:41] <%crimsonharvest> Hey there's the tavern, its a good place to explore from
[1:15:43] <T_Sasquatch> Congrats.  It's the type of game you need outside resources to get
[1:15:43] <%BoxNavy> drink a alcohol i guess
[1:15:44] <+Hyphixsys> @Shinny1338 wouldn't recommend, your dudes can get stuck in some geometric plain LUL
[1:15:44] <aiutare47> uh oh

[1:15:49] <%Dementedpenguin> Rebel scum DansGame
[1:15:51] <%dekkitout> Rebel Scum?
[1:15:52] <+Xalgar> Stop spoiling everything Chat jesus
[1:15:53] <%crimsonharvest> Yeah hang around that place they'll kick the ass of anyone who attacks you nearby
[1:15:53] <+HexForest> Rebels run the bar
[1:15:53] <$RealThiele> yavin IV?
[1:15:55] <+wolfofsound> it can be two things
[1:15:56] <winner_92> B A R
[1:15:57] <BliVru> Click somewhere in the worldmap to go there
[1:15:58] <Shinny1338> time to see that he can't buy shit here either!
[1:16:00] <Slimshazbot> @PatStaresAt A good (if somewhat dull) early objective would be to find and mine and ore seam to sell in town.
[1:16:01] <%crimsonharvest> just retreat here if you get in trouble
[1:16:02] <+glgzephyr> hell of a rebel base
[1:16:06] <+allups> yeeted
[1:16:06] <%Puhff> Boi you picked the WRONG game if you expect Kenshi to explain anything
[1:16:06] <maskedmook> rebelling against WHAT
[1:16:07] <+MacBeyer> duh its 7th Heaven for ninjas. Kappa
[1:16:08] <churropoppa> If you mine you'll get more strength from carrying  the ore and can sell it anywhere.
[1:16:09] <+glgzephyr> two man revolution
[1:16:10] <Shinny1338> @realthiele lmao
[1:16:15] <%BoxNavy> rum
[1:16:28] <%SirGO0SE> hm affordable
[1:16:29] <+HexForest> If we don't spoil things Pat won't know them
[1:16:31] <Broken_Sonex> @PatStaresAt I assume you did no research on this beforehand?
[1:16:31] <+Kitrane> this fucker sells barrels. huh
[1:16:32] <+glgzephyr> Ah yes, my favorite bartender *also* sells curved swords
[1:16:32] <TheA1ternative> thats an aight weapon
[1:16:34] <TheA1ternative> not great
[1:16:35] <+HexForest> This is a wiki game
[1:16:35] <%SirGO0SE> is that cheaper than the other vendor
[1:16:39] <winner_92> i feel like pat played Fortnite and now he is playing Anti-Fortnite
[1:16:39] <hamborgini> \RRANG[ strikes back
[1:16:40] <BliVru> Press C for more confusion!
[1:16:42] <+glgzephyr> HAH

[1:16:45] <%SharkMissile> Oh *no*
[1:16:46] <+MacBeyer> LUL
[1:16:46] <%Teintstein> you fool
[1:16:48] <+OwlLightningMage> THAT WAS A MISTAKE LUL
[1:16:50] <blackbaron98> that was a bad assumption
[1:16:51] <studleydoorite> well you know what they say about assumptions
[1:16:51] <+Kitrane> Oh Pat. Research is required for this.
[1:16:52] <Siconia> Incorrect
[1:16:52] <+allups> O ur crazy for that PAt
[1:16:52] <Noponiz> you dont, it's just gonna be a rough time either way
[1:16:53] <T_Sasquatch> LUL

[1:16:53] <bonebagMEL> oh sweet baby pat...
[1:16:54] <+coolthulhuu> F
[1:16:54] <+WizoSavage> a steam guide helps
[1:16:54] <%Reaped_Psyche> This is one of the most complicated games I've ever seen.
[1:16:55] <lambishly> Honestly it's better that you didn't
[1:16:55] <$SirGO0SE> RIMWORLD POG
[1:16:55] <%BinaryFireball> pat have you played mount and blade?
[1:16:55] <+seoliart> Yeah nah, this is SUPER jank.
[1:16:56] <smagloooshy> LUL
[1:16:56] <%cherrysavestheuniverse> oh noooooooooo
[1:16:56] <Broken_Sonex> This game is kinda fucked like that @PatStaresAt
[1:16:57] <SovPho> 10 years of development means 10 years of wikipages.
[1:17:01] <iq_dropper> That was a mistake
[1:17:04] <%BoxNavy> oh thats always fun a bunch of required reading before starting a game moon2W
[1:17:05] <thenewtypemyth> I guess the thing Pat needs to know is how to initiate various forms of progression.
[1:17:05] <+HexForest> It's an RPG, your objective is to level up and explore
[1:17:05] <+Hyphixsys> Blind playthrough is always nice Kappa
[1:17:06] <%walternatorz> uhoh
[1:17:06] <DecoyBlackmage> puppy sounds
[1:17:07] <TheA1ternative> excused
[1:17:08] <EternalJedi> Rimworld has a lot more direciton than this
[1:17:08] <+triumphantapostle> DOG CUM
[1:17:08] <bonebagMEL> You think FACTORIO was complicated? this is horrible
[1:17:08] <SovPho> Game'
[1:17:09] <masterfire23> objectives? LUL
[1:17:13] <AlexandusLordOfChaos> objective is to get STRONK
[1:17:14] <jorniev> what
[1:17:15] <%superdeliverer> rimworld has a clear goal to work towards, this is a true rpg
[1:17:17] <cherrycottontail> rimworld is 1000x more tutorialized than this
[1:17:17] <Noponiz> @PatStaresAt ask chat for a random objective if that helps? Like "go fight a thing"
[1:17:17] <Ekaelis> you set objectives yourself
[1:17:17] <+allups> nah pat u fucked up i knew this game was a bitch tit to play
[1:17:18] <%dekkitout> HahaDoge
[1:17:19] <$RealThiele> n u t t
[1:17:20] <+TheOlMitcheroo> MAKE AN OBJECTIVE
[1:17:20] <+Xalgar> don't worry Pat, this is no League of Legends levels of complexity
[1:17:20] <%JoshManVGH> Pat Stares at Dog!
[1:17:21] <+MacBeyer> its like he didn't read the tutorials. Kappa
[1:17:21] <+OwlLightningMage> Objectives LUL
[1:17:22] <%MechArch> psaHoldon
[1:17:22] <%ssjklyco> People usually yell at him about the games before he starts
[1:17:22] <+Solutha> Well you would have one if you werent immune to hunger
[1:17:25] <SovPho> Game is held together by sticks and gum. It's a fun idea but god the jank is insanely bad.
[1:17:26] <a_mad_dragon_> your objective is to conquer or kill the entire world
[1:17:27] <+allups> i thought u knew that too
[1:17:27] <+Kitrane> I mean its hilareous watching you fumble and blue screen mentally.
[1:17:27] <greytiziocaio> Kenshi is a game for crazy people with no objectives
[1:17:33] <Broken_Sonex> @PatStaresAt Yeah this is one THOSE games Pat.
[1:17:33] <%metalicblackcherry> objective: get big
[1:17:37] <%Ziegsy> this is giving me little big adventure vibes
[1:17:38] <BliVru> Rightclick on them
[1:17:38] <%redthebaron> like rimworld has a more obvious play loop
[1:17:41] <+triumphantapostle> find ore to mine and avoid getting reamed by bandits
[1:17:42] <+TheMorilo> The objective is to win
[1:17:46] <lambishly> Objective:
[1:17:46] <%Reaped_Psyche> My recommendation for Kenshi is get fast.  They can't kill and enslave you if they can't catch you.
[1:17:49] <%DukeMoose> theyre just guards, handy if youre being chased
[1:17:50] <+Hyphixsys> @greytiziocaio just like IRL Kappa
[1:17:51] <+Peterbyte_> Exploring, scavenging and building up a team is the best early game objective
[1:17:51] <%BoxNavy> ok chat whats the first thing he should be gunning for
[1:17:51] <%walternatorz> lol
[1:17:51] <EuropanLamprey> It's like Minecraft.  There's no objective.  There's just a world
[1:17:52] <%cherrysavestheuniverse> Pat you must go on a huge quest or become a merchant god emperor or a mayor of funky town
[1:17:52] <Siconia> Your objective should be get dog
[1:17:53] <T_Sasquatch> Rimworld sounds like porn LUL
[1:17:53] <+HexForest> Roof is part of building
[1:17:55] <%Teintstein> get big and strong and kill god
[1:17:56] <Noponiz> JUST PUNCH SOMEONE
[1:17:58] <+allups> ur on a roof
[1:18:00] <%cherrysavestheuniverse> there are many options
[1:18:01] <%BoxNavy> monkaS gief
[1:18:01] <+glgzephyr> This game feels like the devs asked "Hey do you guys HATE having quests and structure in your games? WE SURE DO"
[1:18:06] <+HexForest> Go outside on the ground
[1:18:07] <BliVru> Right click on them
[1:18:07] <aiutare47> @PatStaresAt Dont be afraid to ask for help from chat. A lot of Kenshi fans here tonight
[1:18:11] <balthazar758> damn gief
[1:18:13] <+dumemoto> *heavy dog breathing*
[1:18:13] <%Teintstein> @Reaped_Psyche this is very true - just be faster than god and you'll never die
[1:18:13] <cherrycottontail> @ssjklyco no one knows a thing about this game except what for meme vidoes like sseth
[1:18:15] <ullyzeez> just go look for a fight dude
[1:18:17] <+Monkeydude07> oh no
[1:18:17] <+Kitrane> First thing he needs is either to get some cash, or get a weapon.

[1:18:25] <jorniev> oh man combat is so jank

[1:24:12] <greytiziocaio> READ TUTORIAL
[1:24:13] <+messentry> it's almost been hallf an hour, honestly surprising
[1:24:14] <TheA1ternative> @PatStaresAt early fights you should be running these enemies to npcs like a coward
[1:24:14] <%LordSDB> Its okay pat you will wake up eventually since your a bot
[1:24:16] <%backfire_shot> Pat you're too weak you need to avoid fights until you have the money skills and friends to do so.
[1:24:17] <%cherrysavestheuniverse> yeah so your chest is broken and your essentially bleeding out
[1:24:19] <Khester824> “HE DOESN’T HAVE AN OBJECTIVE, GET HIM!”
[1:24:20] <%BoxNavy> go exploring but also die the second you pull aggro

[1:24:40] <+coolthulhuu> yes you run away when youre outnumbered LUL
[1:24:42] <BliVru> Gonna need to fast forward
[1:24:43] <aiutare47> He should go to squin and get a free party member first
[1:24:44] <T_Sasquatch> Wooooooo 👌
[1:24:46] <%dekkitout> psaSkelmo Guess I'll just die
[1:24:49] <%HefestoForges> he doesn't read everything so this is just dead on arrival

[1:24:59] <BliVru> yeap
[1:24:59] <+Double_negative> You will wake up when chest is above 0
[1:25:01] <%JoshManVGH> Now we watch a robot decay

[1:25:02] <Them00n> Get fucked nerd
[1:25:02] <+OwlLightningMage> You have to now
[1:25:04] <Shinny1338> Isn't he done now? Skele don't regen
[1:25:06] <Khester824> LIFE IS SUFFERING
[1:25:06] <%DukeMoose> once all your stats are at least 0
[1:25:08] <+Hyphixsys> watch a bunch of bandits enslaves him LUL
[1:25:09] <snivins> chest is negative
[1:25:09] <ullyzeez> just play fucking fortnite dude
[1:25:11] <%Dunmarkh> welcome to kenshi
[1:25:11] <%BoxNavy> like im all for giving a game a fair shake but... man...
[1:25:11] <+Double_Tap_That> Yep
[1:25:14] <JetpackMcQuack> LUL
[1:25:15] <Fefe41> This is riveting gameplay
[1:25:16] <+coolthulhuu> yeah i think hes dead
[1:25:18] <+OwlLightningMage> You should've fought  people until you are stronger
[1:25:18] <+Double_Tap_That> That or you die
[1:25:20] <+coolthulhuu> as skele
[1:25:21] <+OwlLightningMage> LUL
[1:25:22] <+allups> Pat hates it
[1:25:23] <drjohn92> NOW WE PLAY THE WAITING GAME
[1:25:24] <Noponiz> once nothing is negative you wake up
[1:25:24] <LunarRemix> @CurrySauseBandit To be fair you do need some sort of outside help to get started on this game. It's horrible at teaching the player how to play it
[1:25:25] <DSD24> I feel so bad for Sing
[1:25:26] <lambishly> Wlecome to Kenshi LUL
[1:25:28] <+impressionistcowboy> eyyyyy
[1:25:29] <+Solutha> you are slowly healing that minor bleed
[1:25:29] <+glgzephyr> don't you love it when your death state just costs you fifteen minutes instead of a game over screen?
[1:25:30] <$RealThiele> amazing
[1:25:30] <+MacBeyer> tutorials tell you everything you need to get started, the rest you figure out on your own. There is stuff to do and see but the game does not hold your hand at all. Get good or die.
[1:25:31] <ullyzeez> 10/10
[1:25:32] <+Veraverse> I'm laughing, but with respect
[1:25:32] <JetpackMcQuack> Just like dark souls
[1:25:33] <%xmetalicdemonx> Just got here what is this game?
[1:25:35] <%SirGO0SE> just playing dead LUL
[1:25:37] <Paciboyy> its one of those
[1:25:37] <%BinaryFireball> @PatStaresAt  you should play something easier like mount and blade first and then come back to kenshi
[1:25:37] <%backfire_shot> your good he wont wake up until hes above negatives
[1:25:38] <Them00n> skeletons don't heal dummy.
[1:25:39] <winner_92> well, at least our chest has made it back into positive numbers
[1:25:40] <%cherrysavestheuniverse> you can get up now
[1:25:44] <Broken_Sonex> @PatStaresAt It's like FF2 where you get beat up to get tougher, so this is good
[1:25:48] <aiutare47> He should go to squin and get a free party member first
[1:25:50] <Khester824> Maybe another wanderer will fix you up?
[1:25:51] <%Ziegsy> Im so glad I never bought this
[1:25:51] <+archangel9889> This game is bad!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[1:25:51] <wendigo172> Welcome to Kenshi :)
[1:25:52] <balthazar758> got your ass beat, left unconscious in the desert. mondays man.
[1:25:52] <lambishly> Listen this game is Niche and cult for a reason
[1:25:54] <Man_in_the_Red> playing Skeleton is really not worth it unless you know where to get repair kits/beds
[1:25:54] <sendart> This is s a very slow paced game
[1:25:55] <ullyzeez> yaaaay
[1:25:56] <%bassoontyphoon> you did it!
[1:25:58] <%cherrysavestheuniverse> you should go back to the hub
[1:26:00] <+Xalgar> chat HATES this game LUL
[1:26:00] <snivins> go explore
[1:26:01] <shinichizio> Patbot slowly, tragically crawls off the ground
[1:26:01] <Ekaelis> objective>Heal
[1:26:01] <+allups> ur character looks horrible getting up
[1:26:03] <%cherrysavestheuniverse> and sleep
[1:26:04] <Shinny1338> Go to Squin
[1:26:06] <%Aeoneth> But Pat hated that part of FF2
[1:26:06] <%LordSDB> Check your inventory to see if you got something to repair your body with
[1:26:06] <%dekkitout> And three skeleton days later, he rose from the skeleton grave
[1:26:08] <%Dunmarkh> go back to town and buy a repair kit
[1:26:09] <%backfire_shot> learn to steal
[1:26:10] <$RealThiele> is this the snyder cut?
[1:26:10] <Ipsenscastle> this is crazy interesting to me
[1:26:12] <Talbat> You should probably get to a town
[1:26:12] <%MidnightBurst12> need repairs
[1:26:14] <+OwlLightningMage> You need to do things instead of now doing things LUL
[1:26:15] <%BoxNavy> :)
[1:26:15] <Paciboyy> find a village or something idk
[1:26:16] <roughday25> go to the only other town on your map and see what's up there?
[1:26:16] <+Veraverse> "I don get it"
[1:26:16] <greytiziocaio> GO TO CITY
[1:26:18] <@SoFarFetched> Pat are you okay? LUL
[1:26:18] <rosysyntax> should've been a human
[1:26:18] <%walternatorz> this experience is just going to drive pat further into the fortnite hole
[1:26:19] <%DukeMoose> Skeleton machine men cant heal via cheap first aid kits and require expensiver repair tools.
[1:26:22] <+alpharius88> go to squin
[1:26:22] <JetpackMcQuack> PogChamp keep trying skeleton
[1:26:23] <+archangel9889> quite and play something else maybe?
[1:26:24] <KingFatality> as a big fan of this game it's a fucking mess that refuses to tell you about mechanics let alone teach them
[1:26:25] <%Dunmarkh> Buy a repair kit pat
[1:26:25] <%BinaryFireball> CRITICAL THINKING  ACTIVATE
[1:26:25] <+coolthulhuu> apparently pat's chat is full of impatients children
[1:26:26] <+Javaa01> Find a way to not die
[1:26:26] <aiutare47> GO TO SQUIN
[1:26:26] <+glgzephyr> this is the Snyder Cut we all asked for
[1:26:27] <alcmo> pats brain is too smol for this game
[1:26:27] <%AzureGale> "Guess I'll die"
[1:26:28] <greytiziocaio> GET MORE PEOPLE
[1:26:29] <%superdeliverer> objective for me would be kill the bandits
[1:26:30] <Ipsenscastle> go to village or city
[1:26:31] <%Kirby_Sauce> monster hunter pat
[1:26:32] <+Solutha> Well robots need Robot Repair kits which are very expensive
[1:26:34] <%JoshManVGH> Remember factories? Those where cool, huh?
[1:26:35] <%MechArch> sing
[1:26:35] <Zeif00> He likes it
[1:26:35] <%MidnightBurst12> Pat seriously needs a guide
[1:26:35] <Shinny1338> go to squin
[1:26:37] <%rios> skeles dont heal
[1:26:37] <$RealThiele> pat.exe is not running
[1:26:38] <+OwlLightningMage> HE CAN'T BUILD A BASE LUL
[1:26:38] <%DukeMoose> Punch some rocks
[1:26:38] <Ekaelis> Watch Sseth review before playing?
[1:26:40] <+tuchpi> @generalscpatton base building ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper
[1:26:40] <%justcallmebobplease> Patton
[1:26:41] <snivins> you need friends first
[1:26:41] <%superdeliverer> kill banditos
[1:26:42] <+allups> someone told him not to build the base
[1:26:42] <thenewtypemyth> ooooh
[1:26:43] <%backfire_shot> Thats way too early
[1:26:43] <%justcallmebobplease> Don't stop screaming
[1:26:45] <ullyzeez> base building is not somethjng pat can do
[1:26:46] <huskarl_zap> Mine iron and sell it
[1:26:46] <Slimshazbot> @PatStaresAt You essentailly jumped into Dwarf Fortress without doing any research here.
[1:26:46] <+wolfofsound> LUL
[1:26:47] <%justcallmebobplease> Keep screaming, Patton
[1:26:47] <+Veraverse> Pat, you're suffering. Play something else for your sanity
[1:26:47] <lambishly> As someone who loves this game this is not a you game probably LUL
[1:26:48] <FleshFriend> Wait no he was joking
[1:26:51] <%Dunmarkh> Buy a repair kit so you don't die
[1:26:51] <+Despera__> @Ekaelis he did
[1:26:51] <Shinny1338> Go to Squin
[1:26:52] <+Xalgar> 4Head Just build a base
[1:26:53] <alcmo> SCREAM MORE
[1:26:53] <+OwlLightningMage> He needs to get stronger LUL
[1:26:56] <+tuchpi> subs yelling advice LUL
[1:26:57] <shinichizio> Clapped
[1:26:57] <BliVru> You can click on the World map to go somewhere
[1:26:58] <jorniev> THIS game its a super brutal survival RTS
[1:26:59] <%HefestoForges> exactly
[1:27:00] <%blastyoboots> I love how everyone was dismayed at the idea of Pat playing Fortnite and now that they witness THE ALTERNATIVE those same people are begging him to give up
[1:27:00] <+JonWhoLovesFlatWomen> only screaming
[1:27:01] <%BoxNavy> WutFace
[1:27:03] <JetpackMcQuack> It’s simple 4Head
[1:27:06] <+allups> flying snake
[1:27:07] <bonebagMEL> yep
[1:27:08] <+Hyphixsys> LUL
[1:27:09] <Ciglossonjr> Go and mine and earn cash, you're not going to achieve anything standing around
[1:27:10] <+allups> normal
[1:27:11] <+Kitrane> Dont mind the flying U's
[1:27:11] <%DukeMoose> Go find some interactabe rocks that you can punch near The Hub for money.
[1:27:11] <%redthebaron> i think dwarf fortress is easier to get than kenshi
[1:27:11] <%Ranryu692> just do the thing, idiot!
[1:27:13] <+OwlLightningMage> He needs to get more people, get stronger, get more money
[1:27:13] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[1:27:15] <NoirePanzer> NotLikeThis
[1:27:15] <%thelaxinator> Does it?
[1:27:16] <$Reaped_Psyche> It does!?
[1:27:16] <%JoshManVGH> How much research is required to start this game fresh?
[1:27:17] <%HefestoForges> what?
[1:27:18] <+WizoSavage> it does?
[1:27:18] <+coolthulhuu> same goal as this game
[1:27:18] <SovPho> you can build a fortress in this
[1:27:18] <%Axellogic> Dont die
[1:27:19] <%bassoontyphoon> Flying Snek??
[1:27:19] <mouse_1312> just explore the world first, you won't understand most systems until experiencing them
[1:27:19] <ThirdPersonPhil> Does it?
[1:27:20] <snivins> check map
[1:27:21] <dragoon001914> Objective: Survive
[1:27:21] <%Valdorick> ... Does it?
[1:27:22] <%Dunmarkh> no it doesn't
[1:27:22] <+glgzephyr> @jorniev How is this an RTS? I don't see any unit production
[1:27:22] <%BinaryFireball> no
[1:27:23] <jorniev> also a mode without a goal
[1:27:23] <balthazar758> capslock power is dangerous
[1:27:23] <%bevyrage> dorf fort doesn't have a goal what are you talking about
[1:27:24] <%kewlmyc> I'm not going to lie, I have no idea what is happening
[1:27:24] <Luizabd> no it doesnt
[1:27:25] <%justcallmebobplease> DORF FORT DON'T HAVE NO GOAL, WTF U TALKIN' BOUT!
[1:27:26] <Them00n> no it doesn't
[1:27:26] <drjohn92> Go to the northwest, through a valley, and you’ll find a village
[1:27:26] <ullyzeez> what goal???
[1:27:26] <aiutare47> hes going to bleed out
[1:27:27] <+messentry> Pat, you need the pat you were for woolie for this  game
[1:27:28] <+tuchpi> just go mine 4Head
[1:27:28] <DianaTheAscian> oh pats on this goal shit again
[1:27:29] <thenewtypemyth> DF tells you vaguely what you need to do, just not how.
[1:27:29] <%bassoontyphoon> does it?
[1:27:31] <%thelaxinator> The goal of dwarf fortress is survive I guess? Maybe become a mountainhome?
[1:27:31] <Slimshazbot> Has no more a goal than this
[1:27:33] <+Javaa01> Not if you play the real version of Dwarf Fortress, not that vegan Adventure mode garbo
[1:27:34] <%cherrysavestheuniverse> go level up your RUN and MINE skills and start earning money for yourself so you can fix yourself.
[1:27:35] <+Jiggisnipe> idk Pat just something I guess, this is weird
[1:27:35] <Khester824> Pat just ask yourself what you would do in a post-apocalypse world
[1:27:35] <Man_in_the_Red> and they both have the same goal, survive
[1:27:37] <T_Sasquatch> misuLad misuLad misuLad
[1:27:37] <TheA1ternative> you can move wasd while in the prospect menu
[1:27:37] <%DukeMoose> no
[1:27:37] <%justcallmebobplease> 'GOAL' IS TO MAKE A FUN CLUSTERFUCK OF A DEATH
[1:27:37] <+pectusumbra> Alright, I think I'm good on this one. Have fun
[1:27:38] <KingFatality> goal: get rich get paid
[1:27:40] <+Kitrane> I actually had a easier time with kenshi than Dwarf fortress. then again I'm not used go ascii games
[1:27:41] <%DukeMoose> Closer to the hub
[1:27:42] <+WizoSavage> Copper sells for more than Iron
[1:27:42] <%moonmintparadise> i think that is a rock
[1:27:42] <Sunstalker> Does it really? D:
[1:27:44] <+Dorf1> dwarf fortress has as much of a goal as this game does, survive and be eficient
[1:27:45] <+allups> Pat some of the best game are played without goals
[1:27:46] <%BinaryFireball> you dont have a pick axe
[1:27:47] <+skm742> I'll be honest, I was baffled when I heard that kenshi would be attempted, and expected exactly this
[1:27:50] <jorniev> @glgzephyr you find people and recruit them
[1:27:51] <AlexandusLordOfChaos> don't worry about prospecting for now
[1:27:52] <winner_92> ooooo 57 copper :O
[1:27:54] <robintact> @PatStaresAt Who exactly did you hear about Kenshi from?
[1:27:54] <Ciglossonjr> You'll find big rocks on the surface that contain materials, rust style
[1:27:54] <masterfire23> feels like subnautica all over again
[1:27:54] <uristboatmurdered> @thenewtypemyth does it even do that?
[1:27:55] <maskedmook> this game does not seem relaxing
[1:27:56] <Shinny1338> Go to Squin Pat it's a bigger city to get a better feel of things
[1:28:00] <%blastyoboots> Dwarf Fortress's "goal" is technically just "live, get huge, don't die", so you could consider the goal in this game similar
[1:28:02] <EuropanLamprey> The objective is to Thrive.  Run this desert.  Get all the bitches.
[1:28:03] <ullyzeez> make friends with sseth and have him guide you or sum shit
[1:28:05] <+glgzephyr> @jorniev That sounds like an RPG, not an RTS
[1:28:06] <%backfire_shot> I wish i could just get into a call and guide him by the hips
[1:28:09] <%cherrysavestheuniverse> I think you need a pickaxe first its been a hot minute
[1:28:09] <greytiziocaio> mine copper for 5 hours, that's the beginning of the game
[1:28:13] <ullyzeez> same
[1:28:13] <%SharkMissile> Pat, a good beginner objective is to build a small semi-self sufficient colony
[1:28:13] <shinichizio> I feel like Paige told Pat to play this game as a cruel prank
[1:28:13] <%moonmintparadise> giant rock
[1:28:13] <%LordSDB> Its that weird looking rock pat
[1:28:14] <illTemperedSeaBass> @blastyoboots when given two terrible options, you have to decide what the lesser evil is. Sometimes what appears the less evil harbors an entire new level of evil within.
[1:28:16] <$RealThiele> i am not disappointed by pats reaction LUL
[1:28:17] <+Edrem> hey hey people
[1:28:22] <%Axellogic> Just run around naked and everything will work out

[1:28:23] <%SveriSageAdvice> probably doesnt help Pat that dozens of you are giving conflicting goals lol
[1:28:24] <+Double_negative> Open map, find something nearby on map, go there. If you dont know what to do, explore and figure things out. Just talk to people on the way. Mine, loot, sell it for money. Buy better gear.
[1:28:25] <%LordSDB> To the right by the tree pat
[1:28:25] <aiutare47> @PatStaresAt Mining is done by walking up to big mineral deposits, not prospecting. its unintuitive but so is kenshi

[1:30:53] <%HefestoForges> pat you have automated tasks for that
[1:30:54] <Jerp> is Pat streaming from the same PC he's playing on? I wonder if Kenshi has some weird capture stuff that would require screen capture instead of game capture

[1:30:55] <aiutare47> oh he doesnt have the stack mod
[1:30:55] <+WizoSavage> Shift + Right click

[1:31:10] <+Xalgar> I love this game LUL
[1:31:10] <theCrowRunner> Riveting gameplay
[1:31:10] <mouse_1312> this game requires a massive time investment to enjoy lmao

[1:31:13] <ullyzeez> @realthiele you really think pat isnt gonna changes games an hour in?
[1:31:14] <+OwlLightningMage> This was everything I wanted it to be LUL
[1:31:14] <%GarbageNirvana> Think of it like Death Stranding except even more obtuse
[1:31:15] <jorniev> you are just starting
[1:31:15] <+RootVeggie> They can stack in the output slot so you don't need to do every individual copper
[1:31:15] <HeroToxiko> @shaddydaddyo thats what i was gonna say
[1:31:16] <Broken_Sonex> There's always slavery @PatStaresAt
[1:31:16] <Zaphire_Saucypants> really? a year?
[1:31:17] <T_Sasquatch> You guys ?? I'm not you guys
[1:31:17] <malletman241> i mean some people actually try to learn things
[1:31:17] <%cherrysavestheuniverse> there is deffinately tension in the game
[1:31:18] <Ciglossonjr> I mean you saw it yourself on Sseth's review. eventually you can build a base and stuff
[1:31:18] <sourdough_scones> I've never seen a run this good
[1:31:19] <+impressionistcowboy> I mean for chat's credit I think it is like dwarf fortress where you make your own fun
[1:31:19] <aiutare47> pat shouldve had the slave begining it has goal
[1:31:19] <+Pengers> this looks like dog shit
[1:31:19] <dragoon001914> Seeing you suffer in games is what gives us joy
[1:31:20] <%backfire_shot> Think of this game like an RPG mixed with an RTS
[1:31:20] <+hrudzie_1> idk why the fuck you would listen to us
[1:31:21] <%heartlesshealer> no one said it was INCREDIBLE
[1:31:21] <%BoxNavy> he do be mining for minutes on end tho
[1:31:22] <mouse_1312> bad stream game unless you have a dedicated bit
[1:31:23] <shinichizio> This game is stream poison
[1:31:23] <%LordSDB> Now you can sell the copper for money
[1:31:24] <worldbrand> you having fun was not a part of us wanting to see it
[1:31:24] <+coolthulhuu> i think he didnt actually watch it lol
[1:31:24] <+WizoSavage> @PatStaresAt Rome wasn't built in a day, Pat
[1:31:25] <Jerp> slow game, I think a low amount of time for a run of this would be like 100 hours
[1:31:25] <%Agami23> this HD texture pack for runescape is wild
[1:31:27] <alcmo> the thugs are bored of you, dont worry
[1:31:27] <%goose_attack_almanac> I woulda watched fortnite honestly.
[1:31:27] <shaddydaddyo> yo this is fuckin rad
[1:31:27] <Them00n> @glgzephyr  mostly yeah, I do like Kenshi though.
[1:31:28] <%HefestoForges> okay fuck y'all
[1:31:29] <winner_92> those bandits were schmovin
[1:31:30] <+glgzephyr> Those of you who are calling this an RTS don't understand what Real Time Strategy is
[1:31:31] <+dutchmasterprime> no zoooming here
[1:31:32] <%Garthunox> great, now he's never gonna trust us again
[1:31:32] <ullyzeez> POOOOOG
[1:31:33] <%Dunmarkh> LUL
[1:31:33] <AlexandusLordOfChaos> mining starts are boring, best done by secondary characters you recruit
[1:31:33] <Ipsenscastle> I mean clearly there's more to it
[1:31:33] <+Javaa01> Okay now find somewhere to actually pawn that stuff off
[1:31:33] <+impressionistcowboy> also I am on team suffering
[1:31:34] <%walternatorz> how close was pat to getting knocked out there?

[1:31:39] <EuropanLamprey> Pat, quick question: This or Minecraft?
[1:31:39] <Javi9563> this game is good, but it's not a stream game at all
[1:31:40] <Ekaelis> Pat, you just picked the most mundane way to earn money here
[1:31:40] <+allups> Pat u dont have to be a protector u decided to do this
[1:31:40] <MrFlugaFluga> ok now sell the copper
[1:31:40] <aiutare47> I really do think slavery would be a better start
[1:31:41] <+TheMorilo> It really gets going when you are 500 hours in
[1:31:41] <KingFatality> this game is esoteric nonsense and I still love playing it, note sure about watching someone do a full playthrough however
[1:31:43] <%Garthunox> yeah play fortnite, do a big 90
[1:31:43] <robintact> Is Pat dying, are you dying, Pat?
[1:31:43] <Ciglossonjr> Now go sell it for profit

[1:32:05] <+Xalgar> He hit the rocks PogChamp

[1:32:10] <%Teintstein> the whiplash from fortnite to this might actually break people's minds
[1:32:13] <+allups> lets hope u dont run into any dangers
[1:32:16] <+glgzephyr> you ready to stream this for the next month to see progress?
[1:32:16] <+WutangchickeN> Can you use that ore to fend off Creepers?  Isn't this Minecraft?
[1:32:17] <aiutare47> @cherrysavestheuniverse Thats not fun thats brutal
[1:32:20] <%walternatorz> I would rather watch pat play Fortnite than this. And I hate the fact Pat is playing Fortnite.
[1:32:21] <Zaphire_Saucypants> you ready to slaughter some children, Pat?
[1:32:21] <Khester824> Pat can’t handle a true gamer’s game
[1:32:22] <drjohn92> @patstaresat you can sell copper and buy “building materials” to make a base
[1:32:22] <iq_dropper> It's just like early  game FFXIV but with cannibals
[1:32:23] <%bread_assassin> Why's the word Sing above Pat's head? Did he name himself that?
[1:32:23] <%Dunmarkh> fuck I wanna play kenshi now
[1:32:24] <FleshFriend> LUL just stick with it, by hour 200 you'll start to get the gist of it
[1:32:24] <winner_92> @Teintstein it's breaking mine
[1:32:25] <Cici_TheMoonRabbit> Jerma LOVED this game
[1:32:28] <+impressionistcowboy> ahhhh got it
[1:32:29] <%DukeMoose> He's not lying
[1:32:30] <Them00n> This game is super not a Pat game.
[1:32:33] <shubachi> i don't understand how this game sold a million copies, even if its fun later, it's so hard to understand
[1:32:34] <samazam94> i bet none of those people actually even play kenshi. they just watched sseth and thought "hurr durr lets make pat play this itll be fun"
[1:32:36] <cheapdoc> how are 1000 people still here?
[1:32:38] <malletman241> shoulda maybe watched the review
[1:32:39] <lambishly> I have like 800 hours in this game
[1:32:39] <+alpharius88> its a SLOW STAR
[1:32:41] <TheA1ternative> Try the "Guy with a dog" start @PatStaresAt
[1:32:41] <KingFatality> the beginning is painful always
[1:32:42] <%Broand> Getting there is tough
[1:32:43] <+triumphantapostle> its the slowest of burns
[1:32:44] <+Monkeydude07> it comes with like 500 hours of prep
[1:32:45] <Broken_Sonex> @PatStaresAt yYou can do some crazy shit, ya just gotta know how.
[1:32:46] <+JonWhoLovesFlatWomen> just start a character that's farther along than this
[1:32:46] <+alpharius88> like glacial
[1:32:47] <+allups> LOL paige
[1:32:48] <%MrMegaJackpots> it's too much
[1:32:48] <$RealThiele> you have to dig deep for that fun
[1:32:48] <winner_92> this looks INCREDIBLY inaccessible
[1:32:49] <bonebagMEL> yep
[1:32:50] <%BoxNavy> it is nothing
[1:32:51] <ullyzeez> its not rude at all lmao
[1:32:51] <+tuchpi> there's like 30 different beginnings you can pick though?????????
[1:32:52] <aiutare47> play the slave begining
[1:32:53] <Zayasu> LUL LUL
[1:32:54] <+WizoSavage> Depends on your starting path
[1:32:54] <+Pequod1> shoulda had the slave start
[1:32:55] <SovPho> he's not wrong it takes like 2 hours to get started
[1:32:56] <%LordSDB> No your right, you start from 0 and work you way up!
[1:32:56] <%BigDumBeak> NotLikeThis
[1:32:56] <+impressionistcowboy> honestly, this game looks even more hard to get into than like mount and blade
[1:32:58] <studleydoorite> yeah this seems like a fine Jerma game
[1:32:58] <+FingaLights> its a sloooooow start to get going
[1:32:58] <KingFatality> the slowest start to a game I've ever experienced
[1:32:59] <lambishly> VERY inaccessable
[1:33:00] <Ekaelis> Its only nothing because you dont know anything yet LUL
[1:33:00] <+Edrem> from humble beginnings
[1:33:01] <Ciglossonjr> It's better when you get more people, so you can do more work and get more resources faster
[1:33:03] <Slimshazbot> @samazam94 I have 177 hours in this.
[1:33:05] <+TheMorilo> The beginning is everything, that's why it looks like nothing
[1:33:05] <%LordSDB> Unless you mod LUL
[1:33:06] <Fefe41> This is some boss sound track though
[1:33:06] <+glgzephyr> Paige do you see what is on the screen?
[1:33:09] <%backfire_shot> The game starts slow and builds up to millions of miles an hour over the course of quite a while
[1:33:09] <%Dunmarkh> @JonWhoLovesFlatWomen that's not a thing really
[1:33:09] <+Kitrane> yea the character start you choose can really effect early game enjoyment as well
[1:33:09] <%DukeMoose> Pat, i will reiterate. the game starts punishly becuase you are not equivilant to a single, starving bandit with a stick.
[1:33:10] <bob900000> no positivity allowed here
[1:33:11] <%cherrysavestheuniverse> Imagine this like warcraft 3 and your playing as an orc peon earning money to get your best units
[1:33:12] <T_Sasquatch> @cheapdoc its literally to see pat suffer
[1:33:14] <Estuko> I feel like this game is absolutely not a Pat game, as loved as it may be in the community and stuff. I worry that it won't click for him
[1:33:15] <KaiserMario> "It gets good after ch 157 of the manga"
[1:33:16] <+glgzephyr> I WONDER WHY HE DOESN'T KNOW ANYTHING
[1:33:16] <+Peterbyte_> yeah one of the other beginnings might give you more of a direction
[1:33:16] <JetpackMcQuack> Plopped into a map with a sword
[1:33:17] <TheFramedWarlock> Snailshi let's goooooooooo
[1:33:18] <%BinaryFireball> and you're not the type to learn on your own
[1:33:22] <T_Sasquatch> everyone is here for the suffering
[1:33:22] <malletman241> you making an effort
[1:33:22] <+WizoSavage> It's mostly nothing cause as a Robot you're not STARVING
[1:33:23] <+allups> its how u said it pat
[1:33:25] <Zaphire_Saucypants> so from what I understand from the chat....this is basically Stockholm Syndrome the Game?
[1:33:25] <%walternatorz> there's nothing driving the character to progress
[1:33:25] <+Javaa01> The difference is, you can hit a Wiki
[1:33:25] <jorniev> you are correct pat
[1:33:26] <TheA1ternative> in time it'll be something
[1:33:27] <+glgzephyr> IF ONLY THERE WERE SOME SORT OF A TUTORIAL
[1:33:27] <HeroToxiko> yeah bro just wait till like 12 hours in, you'll looove it LUL
[1:33:27] <codizle> Just tuning in, I'm intrigued but also appalled
[1:33:29] <ullyzeez> its nothing FOR YOU :)
[1:33:30] <Stigmergy> finding a good source of robo repairs might be important
[1:33:32] <+tuchpi> BabyRage
[1:33:32] <+Jiggisnipe> does anyone's 1st time start off as something?
[1:33:33] <drjohn92> See if the Batman has building materials to make a base with
[1:33:34] <jorniev> ITS a HARSH START
[1:33:34] <cheapdoc> @T_Sasquatch just to suffer
[1:33:35] <%BinaryFireball> no
[1:33:35] <+coolthulhuu> goalgoalgoal
[1:33:35] <+glgzephyr> OR A WAY TO LEARN HOW TO PLAY IT BESIDES YOUTUBE
[1:33:35] <%Dunmarkh> restart and do cannibal hunter start, you'll get goals fast
[1:33:36] <+OwlLightningMage> If you know what you're doing it is something
[1:33:36] <%Agami23> pat, you could be playing ultrakill or fortnite right now
[1:33:37] <Rionxgarland> why hasn't hienz sponsored paige yet
[1:33:37] <EuropanLamprey> Make it something Pat
[1:33:38] <penitentpendant> Is this in beta or something?
[1:33:40] <Jerp> yea, it's just a big slow jank game that has so much weird esoteric shit, but the deeper you dive the more it sucks you in. but that might be like 15+ hours later
[1:33:42] <%SveriSageAdvice> yeah where is it @glgzephyr
[1:33:44] <%JoshManVGH> No Mans Sky has more of a tutorial, and more of an objective, and that game was esoteric as fuck when it started..
[1:33:46] <%MrMegaJackpots> yeah there really should be a tutorial
[1:33:47] <+saltpiggu> didn't you grow up in NES era or some shit
[1:33:48] <greytiziocaio> The REAL objective of Kenshi is to find Beep and turn him in the strongest warrior in the land
[1:33:51] <+saltyvest> It's runescape tbh
[1:33:51] <+TungstenViper> why should the player give a fuck about what to do?
[1:33:52] <sendart> Make your own Fun
[1:33:52] <%BinaryFireball> brb calling kotaku
[1:33:54] <+tuchpi> one piece fans telling you to watch 500 episodes before it gets good Kappa
[1:33:55] <%Fooguwu> BAR
[1:33:56] <thenewtypemyth> maybe robot was a bad 1st choice
[1:33:58] <bob900000> this feels like a stream poison game
[1:33:58] <+FingaLights> on boarding sucks for this game
[1:33:59] <Visorak6> I apologize for all the vitriolic comments you're gonna get for this
[1:34:04] <+impressionistcowboy> Honestly I think you'd probably do better with an open exploration with a bit more story/streamlining
[1:34:05] <%dave323dave> dont you know you have to do research before playing any game??
[1:34:07] <+allups> honesty if i was pat id do research into a storyline that might be neat and do that maybe
[1:34:11] <+OwlLightningMage> The objective is to survive and get stronger
[1:34:15] <+WizoSavage> recruit
[1:34:15] <rosysyntax> Okay, now do that again 100x
[1:34:17] <+impressionistcowboy> maybe better ramp
[1:34:19] <%ssjklyco> This looks like just worst Runescape
[1:34:19] <+glgzephyr> @SveriSageAdvice Beats me, this game seems awful
[1:34:20] <penitentpendant> @Jerp Why would a streamer broadcast 15 hours of nothing before reaching something?
[1:34:20] <%heartlesshealer> Game's jank and esoteric and the whole point of getting you to play it was probably to see you struggle against it's systems
[1:34:22] <Ipsenscastle> @bob900000 these are relatively great viewer numbers
[1:34:22] <+Kitrane> Yea when you play a fleshie there is always the stress of 'gotta get food, now water, holy crap this bandit ate my leg'
[1:34:23] <Talbat> Check if they have a repair kit?
[1:34:25] <%DukeMoose> now go mine more.
[1:34:27] <+tuchpi> LUL
[1:34:27] <plushy0> Become a drug lord, seriously you can do that
[1:34:27] <blackbaron98> foods
[1:34:28] <KingFatality> this game is for those "hardcore" pc game players who have to look everything up to figure out how to play the game
[1:34:32] <Ciglossonjr> CASH OBTAINED
[1:34:34] <greytiziocaio> Do it again
[1:34:38] <$RealThiele> go mine more serf
[1:34:43] <maskedmook> this is the worst start to a game I have seen
[1:34:47] <%Broand> Try talking with other dudes in the bar?
[1:34:48] <Ciglossonjr> Get more, get strong, get rich
[1:34:49] <jorniev> hire a guy?
[1:34:50] <%cherrysavestheuniverse> your character doesnt use first aid kits just remember that
[1:34:50] <+TungstenViper> @KingFatality exactly LUL
[1:34:52] <%BoxNavy> i dont know what toothpicks do but get them
[1:34:52] <%backfire_shot> build money buy weapon steal armor off of your enemies
[1:34:54] <drjohn92> You can make a shack with building materials, the green crate
[1:34:54] <heythatguy> Produce the alcohols
[1:34:55] <ullyzeez> HYPEST GAMEPLAY ON TWITCH
[1:34:56] <%DukeMoose> Skeleton man cool, but not good to start with
[1:34:57] <%heartlesshealer> anyway, leaving to deliver food, hope you all have some kind of fun(???)!
[1:34:58] <+allups> so this game is just sea of thieves with lots of filler with bad graphics
[1:34:58] <%Broand> oh
[1:34:58] <bob900000> @ipsenscastle guess I'm wrong
[1:34:58] <Shinny1338> Go to Squin for repair kit
[1:34:58] <studleydoorite> is Kenshi actually good or mostly a meme?
[1:34:59] <JetpackMcQuack> Hard out there for s pimp
[1:34:59] <+ReallyBigRocks> can skeletons heal with first aid? I'm assuming not
[1:35:01] <BlindGato> Abandon ship
[1:35:02] <samazam94> this seem like its no fun for both pat and viewers
[1:35:04] <+blastazoid00> Defeat Ganon
[1:35:04] <aiutare47> Wanderer is how the game is meant to be played but it is overwhelming by design, almost all the other beginnings have some rough goals or direction
[1:35:05] <+triumphantapostle> isnt hobbs in that bar
[1:35:06] <+Peterbyte_> You could check out the city to the south
[1:35:07] <TheA1ternative> what about the guy with a beanie and shirt?
[1:35:07] <BliVru> Free NPC in Squin
[1:35:08] <+glgzephyr> Vanilla No Man's Sky was better than this
[1:35:08] <Slimshazbot> One of them should be a freebie
[1:35:09] <+coolthulhuu> good point, skeleton was a terrible choice. normally the goal is get food and dont die
[1:35:09] <heythatguy> Create a kung fu fight force
[1:35:09] <HeroToxiko> kick rocks: the videogame LUL
[1:35:12] <Hellarussian> this game is non-stop action
[1:35:13] <+impressionistcowboy> pat you ever check out sunless seas/skies? Curious how man mandy/sseth games you've played
[1:35:13] <%Dunmarkh> @ReallyBigRocks no, big no
[1:35:14] <%LordSDB> You have enough to hire some body guards for a day
[1:35:14] <+alpharius88> In squin there's one thas is like 1k or free
[1:35:14] <+Despera__> Go to Squin, free guy and repair kit
[1:35:15] <+Veraverse> Play Doom instead
[1:35:17] <rosysyntax> go to Squin
[1:35:17] <plushy0> grow drugssss
[1:35:18] <Blank9> this looks like shit
[1:35:22] <Fien111> For real, the best strategy is to mine copper for like 10 hours until you can get like 4 more guys and equipment for them all, then go get your shit kicked in
[1:35:23] <MrFlugaFluga> you are injured. goal acquired. current goal heal self
[1:35:24] <+TungstenViper> why is everything literally froze in place?
[1:35:27] <%backfire_shot> and theyre also disgusting organic creatures that require food
[1:35:28] <plushy0> be a drug runner
[1:35:28] <cheapdoc> This game looks like it was made in 2000
[1:35:31] <%BoxNavy> squin...
[1:35:32] <%Cozy90> it is uncomfortably quiet in that bar]
[1:35:32] <+tuchpi> @studleydoorite it's fun just no one has any Patience LUL
[1:35:33] <Ciglossonjr> He doesn't know where the fck Squin iis
[1:35:34] <LiteralViewBot> kenshi is only a good game after 20 hours of figuring out how to play it. this was a terrible idea
[1:35:34] <+Monkeydude07> you can just click on the map
[1:35:36] <+Kitrane> yea the wanderer is a bit too freeform for a lot of people
[1:35:37] <+vicar_anat> Work. Work. Get Money. Work. Get Money.
[1:35:40] <%cherrysavestheuniverse> your gonna wanna be careful on your way there
[1:35:41] <%LordSDB> Maybe hire those body guards before you leave @PatStaresAt
[1:35:41] <Shinny1338> oh thank god
[1:35:42] <%DukeMoose> you can also queue up travel from the map
[1:35:43] <KingFatality> literally run back and forth farming the gold and selling it for an hour or 5 training thus training your mining and strength is the start of every one of my kenshi games
[1:35:44] <rosysyntax> You can click the map.
[1:35:46] <%cherrysavestheuniverse> pay close attention to the terrain
[1:35:46] <+impressionistcowboy> is there a compass lol
[1:35:48] <%superdeliverer> yeah no compass
[1:35:50] <Ciglossonjr> Oh yeah I forgot its on the map from the start
[1:35:50] <Fien111> This game is Fallout Runescape
[1:35:50] <aiutare47> double click the portrait to focus camera
[1:35:51] <%Broand> Ironic, because you're directionless!
[1:35:52] <%backfire_shot> double click portrait to auto follow
[1:35:52] <Stigmergy> anyone with the Mercenary faction is temporary hire, not permanent. They have better stats
[1:35:52] <%Dunmarkh> left click on the character portait
[1:35:52] <Jerp> penitentpendant depends on how you go about it - I've seen a lot of interesting stuff happen for some streamers in the first 5-30 minutes. the game is very much an expression of the player -- you see similar with stuff like viscera cleanup detail. I played Kenshi pretty safe so while I had some interesting moments in the first few hours, it didn't get wild for me until probably 5-10 hours in
[1:35:52] <+Javaa01> @maskedmook Then you haven't seen URW or ASCII Dwarf Fortress
[1:35:52] <+OwlLightningMage> This game was made by one guy LUL
[1:35:54] <%LordSDB> You have 2000 right?
[1:35:54] <BliVru> right click on Squin to go there from World map
[1:35:55] <DianaTheAscian> oh wow thats a free camera
[1:35:56] <%TaifuDragon> You can travel on the map
[1:35:57] <winner_92> holy fuck this game is huge
[1:35:57] <T_Sasquatch> pats viewer count is like 40 times bigger than the second biggest kenshi stream LUL
[1:35:59] <+Monkeydude07> @PatStaresAt you can just click on the map
[1:35:59] <+Solutha> you can click the map to move
[1:36:02] <shinichizio> Whoa, draw distance
[1:36:02] <+Jiggisnipe> earn money I guess
[1:36:05] <+WizoSavage> You can buy destroyed buildings by clicking on them and looking at the bottom right
[1:36:07] <Shinny1338> You can just click on your map to go there
[1:36:09] <%DukeMoose> Map + Right Click
[1:36:10] <%LordSDB> Did the price change?
[1:36:10] <+allups> @glgzephyr dont know bout that one chief LUL
[1:36:14] <%superdeliverer> music helps out a lot too
[1:36:17] <drjohn92> @patstaresat double click character to auto follow them
[1:36:19] <+impressionistcowboy> look at the sun?
[1:36:21] <KingFatality> yup
[1:36:22] <+impressionistcowboy> lol
[1:36:22] <+FingaLights> map follows the camera..... its dumb lol
[1:36:25] <SovPho> @PatStaresAt The idea that "wanderer" is the ideal start while there literally exists a "start with a party" option is fucking insane to me. The game is WORLDS more enjoyable when you have an actual team.
[1:36:26] <%Teintstein> you can also try and steal shit
[1:36:26] <Hellarussian> riveting content
[1:36:27] <rosysyntax> Map + right click = "fast" travel
[1:36:28] <KingFatality> yuuuup
[1:36:29] <%backfire_shot> Dont Go North

[1:36:32] <+OwlLightningMage> LUL
[1:36:33] <cheapdoc> fallout had a tutorial guys, and an objective and a rudimentary story. This is what people think fallout was, instead of what it actually is
[1:36:36] <+allups> well mineing might also be a good way to explore a bit
[1:36:37] <illTemperedSeaBass> It's amazing how over a thousand people are all sitting here in shared, collective misery.
[1:36:37] <T_Sasquatch> LUL
[1:36:37] <$RealThiele> LUL
[1:36:37] <FleshFriend> Runescape streamers tugging their collars
[1:36:39] <malletman241> better end the stream then
[1:36:43] <%PinkSuprende> Steal stuff and run from the cops
[1:36:44] <+GundamF91> Def a game you play by yourself and figure out slowly, not a Stream game at all until after your well enough along
[1:36:45] <+Javaa01> @PatStaresAt You know people stream OS Runescape on this site right?
[1:36:47] <%cherrysavestheuniverse> Its actually not as boring as it may seem
[1:36:47] <+glgzephyr> this game plays like someone made a Neverwinter Nights module and forgot to write a story or questlines
[1:36:48] <%BoxNavy> it cant be worse than anything happening in the game right now
[1:36:48] <%SaiyanShoto> Not if you do it topless
[1:36:50] <Paragon_Sheep> Funny enough, you kinda have to get your ass kicked to level up and get your ass lesss kicked
[1:36:52] <+Kitrane> and now you can fast forward
[1:36:55] <+Jiggisnipe> use this as an opportunity to shoot the shit with chat lol
[1:36:55] <%Dunmarkh> left click on your portrait
[1:36:56] <lambishly> This is NOT a blind game
[1:36:56] <+Monkeydude07> fast forward, and pray you don't get mogged LUL

[1:37:01] <%bassoontyphoon> your character auto runs to where you right click on map
[1:37:02] <SovPho> OSRS has tutorial island lmao
[1:37:03] <%backfire_shot> double click portrait to autofollow
[1:37:03] <shubachi> better refund the game before the 3 hour mark
[1:37:03] <roughday25> steal shit, go to the swap to the south, buy drugs, sell drugs elsewhere for profit!
[1:37:03] <%facto905> disco Elysium time?

[1:37:05] <+DmanDoesThings> questing in OSRS LUL
[1:37:06] <+ALazo> who does quests in runescape?
[1:37:06] <%Agami23> OSRS is good.
[1:37:06] <TheA1ternative> you can get quests here too @PatStaresAt
[1:37:06] <%superdeliverer> this has quests too
[1:37:08] <%cherrysavestheuniverse> yeah this is definately like a free form runescape
[1:37:09] <+Despera__> 95% of the time you're not doing quests tho lol
[1:37:11] <+coolthulhuu> @PatStaresAt the tradional fun way to get money is to taunt packs of bandits and run back to a city so the guards kill them. loot, selll, repeat as much as you want
[1:37:12] <+stoutfish> I didn't like this game because it wants you to have a giant squad of dudes
[1:37:13] <aiutare47> Double click on the character portrait so the camera auto follows @PatStaresAt
[1:37:18] <Sowlith> there are quests in kenshi i thought but you have to find them
[1:37:18] <RWLJr98> fine, minecraft
[1:37:19] <+impressionistcowboy> dog you need to pull a jerma and make up some goofy shit while mining

[1:37:20] <Slimshazbot> @PatStaresAt Double click the portrait to track a character
[1:37:21] <TheA1ternative> there are quests in kenshi
[1:37:22] <+Peterbyte_> double click the character pic
[1:37:22] <SovPho> @tuchpi yeah I think by this point in the game I had restarted about 5 times.
[1:37:26] <Estuko> quests in osrs are fun though lol..
[1:37:27] <%DukeMoose> click on your portrait to lock the camera to the you
[1:37:27] <greytiziocaio> Click on the icon of the character to follow your character
[1:37:27] <+Solutha> forgot the camera tutorial
[1:37:28] <jorniev> REAL life also has quests, you justs kinda go do them
[1:37:30] <+projectmanatees> Osrs is fun
[1:37:31] <%backfire_shot> Double click portrait
[1:37:34] <Shinny1338> Double press the 1 key to lock camera to that character
[1:37:35] <+impressionistcowboy> yeah
[1:37:42] <TheA1ternative> your outhealing the negative
[1:37:42] <alcmo> you get money to buy the hot amazon warrior princess, thats when the game gets good
[1:37:47] <TheA1ternative> for right now at least
[1:37:49] <aiutare47> no its decreasing, its NEGATIVE 50
[1:37:50] <drjohn92> @patstaresat double click your guy to camera lock
[1:37:51] <Ciglossonjr> You don't want to hire bodyguards, you want to get companions. Bodyguards will charge for protecting you for a limited amount of time, but someone who offers to join you without mentioning a limited timeframe will stay with you till you die. This game isn't the greatest for on stream, but can turn into a great production and number go up game once you get the ball rolling up the hill
[1:37:52] <+Javaa01> Nope that's definitely going down
[1:37:56] <+allups> any  game with too many on screen button is a little sus
[1:37:56] <Hellarussian> oh jeez

[1:37:58] <+impressionistcowboy> oh fgukc
[1:37:59] <+glgzephyr> @jorniev If I wanted to simulate real life, I'd go the fuck outside

[1:38:22] <+impressionistcowboy> can you lead the bandits into like a bear den or something
[1:38:23] <+Solutha> Best stat in the game is running
[1:38:24] <+Kitrane> why would you chase metal if you are starving
[1:38:25] <%cherrysavestheuniverse> if you kite them to town you can get them to die and loot em for free
[1:38:26] <winner_92> well see ya guys later i guess
[1:38:28] <Jontman42> you're a robot they can't eat you
[1:38:30] <%Teintstein> run your ass raw
[1:38:31] <Fien111> OH FUCK ME, HE'S A SKELLY?
[1:38:32] <$Afterman_> tiny bot zoom
[1:38:32] <+FingaLights> you have gray life and perm damage you nees to fix to get to gray
[1:38:32] <huskarl_zap> lead them to guards then loot em
[1:38:34] <JetpackMcQuack> You aren’t food
[1:38:34] <+blastazoid00> Run with your stubby robot legs
[1:38:35] <aiutare47> check your stats Pat
[1:38:37] <+Veraverse> This game is weird
[1:38:39] <%DukeMoose> rob you
[1:38:41] <%Teintstein> they could still make you a slave
[1:38:42] <Fien111> Oh pat, sweetheart, no
[1:38:43] <%superdeliverer> get your money to buy food
[1:38:44] <+glgzephyr> Probably salvage you
[1:38:44] <%MidnightBurst12> they rob your food
[1:38:44] <+Javaa01> They can still break you apart and sell you FOR food
[1:38:44] <%redthebaron> they generally steal food
[1:38:46] <balthazar758> skelebot
[1:38:46] <%UltraViolet371> there were sounds for a sec
[1:38:47] <%Fooguwu> cool game
[1:38:48] <BliVru> @patstaresat No joke I forgot how slow early game was
[1:38:49] <mudapersona> sell you for paarts?
[1:38:51] <Dommykins> make a stove out of you
[1:38:51] <+allups> they thought u was human from afar
[1:38:53] <+Javaa01> You are walking scrap, after all
[1:38:54] <+Solutha> those ones try to steal food from you
[1:38:55] <%DukeMoose> beat you up for kicks
[1:38:56] <T_Sasquatch> The utter silence of this and vastness is impressive
[1:39:03] <%cherrysavestheuniverse> so its actually more optimal to be to have prostetics than normal limbs but one of the factions will hate you forever
[1:39:09] <+OwlLightningMage> Running away is the strongest ability you have in the beginning of Kenshi LUL
[1:39:10] <+wolfofsound> so how long until the "real" game starts? or does that depend on build?
[1:39:11] <+alpharius88> yeah early game is a slog
[1:39:13] <DianaTheAscian> is Pat a robot?
[1:39:17] <ullyzeez> R I V E T I N G
[1:39:21] <TheA1ternative> thats not you
[1:39:22] <winner_92> the absolute scale of this game seems pretty nuts
[1:39:22] <RWLJr98> Jobless and homeless, like real life
[1:39:24] <+glgzephyr> why would a robot need a medkit
[1:39:24] <%SirGO0SE> thats the bandit i think
[1:39:24] <+allups> why do u have hunger
[1:39:28] <T_Sasquatch> looooool
[1:39:36] <drjohn92> @patstaresat to heal skeleton you’ll need a repair kit or a repair bed
[1:39:38] <%cherrysavestheuniverse> yeah this game is all about dem empires
[1:39:39] <+OwlLightningMage> I actually love the early game because of all the difference ways you have to get bigger
[1:39:46] <+allups> u had a stick
[1:39:48] <Shinny1338> @wolfofsound depends on your play style and start setting
[1:39:50] <+glgzephyr> @winner_92 Does it? How big *is* this game actually?
[1:39:54] <%redthebaron> they were checking for contraband pat
[1:39:56] <TheA1ternative> Sometimes the guards put drugs in your inventory and make you bribe them @PatStaresAt
[1:39:57] <+FingaLights> @wolfofsound if you know where to get free extra characters, it moves quicker. one person is sloow
[1:39:57] <rosysyntax> find free NPC and steal/sell trash!
[1:39:59] <JetpackMcQuack> Im your new king
[1:40:04] <smagloooshy> @patstaresat Skeletons are cool but they can't heal without a repair kit
[1:40:06] <winner_92> @glgzephyr i have no idea, but every time pat zooms out it looks big
[1:40:08] <jorniev> @glgzephyr YEAH look the irradiated hellscape, totally like real life, im just saying the quest system is just talking to people and going to places.
[1:40:17] <BliVru> check in the bars
[1:40:18] <Shinny1338> You're looking for Ruka
[1:40:21] <%Teintstein> there are much better stores to rob from here
[1:40:22] <Jerp> winner_92 when I first played this game like 2/3 of the map was locked off / in development, and I was still overwhelmed by how large the game was. they've added so much stuff since I played
[1:40:23] <%metalicblackcherry> go to bar
[1:40:24] <Shinny1338> Find Ruka!
[1:40:25] <%BoxNavy> just hire a bodyguard bro 4Head
[1:40:25] <Ciglossonjr> Check the bars
[1:40:30] <T_Sasquatch> did he say 3000 cats ????
[1:40:30] <+OwlLightningMage> LUL
[1:40:31] <%cherrysavestheuniverse> I cant wait for beep
[1:40:34] <James_Quivers> All i've seen of this game is Jerma trying to play it and getting enslaved constantly
[1:40:36] <aiutare47> @PatStaresAt Find a girl named Ruka, shes free
[1:40:37] <%cherrysavestheuniverse> Beep is blessed bean
[1:40:37] <+OwlLightningMage> Pat is meilting on stream LUL
[1:40:38] <Shinny1338> someone with highlights points tell him to find Ruka
[1:40:39] <+Monkeydude07> go to the bar
[1:40:41] <Slimshazbot> @PatStaresAt New recruits usually stay in bars
[1:40:42] <DianaTheAscian> This game seems kinda miserable
[1:40:46] <%vayne_ruu> Time to switch games eh?
[1:40:46] <+glgzephyr> @winner_92 that's just a standard for this genre of point and click RPG for the most part
[1:40:48] <lambishly> This stream is not long for this world LUL
[1:40:49] <rosysyntax> hold ALT for building names
[1:40:53] <%cherrysavestheuniverse> yeah RUka will be your first
[1:40:54] <RWLJr98> Hope this can come to xbox one day. seems interesting
[1:40:55] <Broken_Sonex> @cherrysavestheuniverse Where even is Beep?
[1:41:03] <winner_92> @Jerp yeah i feel like this is a game i could only ever watch someone play for that reason, it's almost overwhelming though very impressive
[1:41:05] <+Monkeydude07> find ruka in the bar
[1:41:13] <+allups> this game looks fine i just wouldnt wanna be rush through it like Pat is kinda having to be
[1:41:21] <SovPho> @DianaTheAscian it kind of is. in a way it's the idea of it
[1:41:25] <%cherrysavestheuniverse> @cherrysavestheuniverse he's in a bad place you dont want to get caught in
[1:41:28] <winner_92> @glgzephyr guess i just don't know the genre that well then
[1:41:31] <%ssjklyco> Can we go back to Disco Elysium? Or fortnite even
[1:41:33] <T_Sasquatch> now maybe im speaking out of turn but man its like youre dying inside, you dont have to keep playing this LUL
[1:41:34] <TheA1ternative> you very badly need a robotics kit
[1:41:35] <Stigmergy> extra team members does result in more mouths to feed
[1:41:37] <+Peterbyte_> this is kinda the worst game possible to have a first impression stream of
[1:41:40] <FleshFriend> cant believe jerma of all people played this game
[1:41:42] <greytiziocaio> Check bars for companions
[1:41:42] <MrFlugaFluga> @cherrysavestheuniverse i think beep is in the fog area
[1:42:00] <%cherrysavestheuniverse> @cherrysavestheuniverse yeppers
[1:42:01] <%BoxNavy> use...
[1:42:02] <Jerp> winner_92 it varies a ton based on who's playing it - there's a lot of stuff that kind of just happens as players drunkenly wander around the world. I think that's the appeal despite how slow and jank the game can be
[1:42:04] <+glgzephyr> @winner_92 if you're interested, I recommend literally any other title in the genre other than this one
[1:42:05] <+allups> use does nothing?
[1:42:05] <Broken_Sonex> @FleshFriend Yeah well Jerma's nuts so, eh
[1:42:06] <smig> jermaJex hard game
[1:42:06] <+GundamF91> use her booba
[1:42:06] <%Dunmarkh> left click to look at things
[1:42:10] <blackbaron98> you dont own it
[1:42:15] <winner_92> @glgzephyr LMAO
[1:42:15] <+Monkeydude07> @PatStaresAt I think there's a free party member in the bar
[1:42:16] <%Fooguwu> how long until pat quits this
[1:42:18] <FleshFriend> @FleshFriend true
[1:42:19] <+Solutha> cant use others ppls shit
[1:42:19] <%cherrysavestheuniverse> @cherrysavestheuniverse that area is where runs go to die if your not careful
[1:42:19] <TrollKing96> Pat, you might be better off playing this game on your own time and when you get your bearings with it, maybe try streaming it again if you want.
[1:42:22] <aiutare47> cant use it
[1:42:26] <rosysyntax> go to bar
[1:42:38] <Stigmergy> skeletons need special repair beds anyway
[1:42:39] <Shinny1338> all these building can be built by you as well as the machines. cant actually use the ones in town but your own built ones can produce items
[1:42:40] <Lagseene> turtleGAMER turtleGAMER
[1:42:43] <%BoxNavy> cursed game
[1:42:48] <Fien111> No, that's kinda normal
[1:42:48] <ullyzeez> pat its ok to give up we understand
[1:42:50] <bookeeee> Did he lose his arms yet
[1:42:51] <Fien111> It's busted as shit
[1:42:51] <2DSuperiority> this is too much for my Fortnite zoomer brain
[1:42:55] <winner_92> @Jerp yeah, that makes sense. i can definitely appreciate that but i think i'm not super into it myself
[1:42:55] <Khester824> Wasn’t pat complaining about a kotaku article about this kinda thing?
[1:42:55] <DianaTheAscian> how far can u zoom out?
[1:42:58] <drjohn92> @patstaresat theres a build icon next to the money
[1:43:01] <ullyzeez> thats your brain failing
[1:43:02] <+ThiccBoiPlump> are you playing in fullscreen windowed?
[1:43:02] <lambishly> Trollking is right
[1:43:06] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[1:43:09] <jorniev> its jank super brutal game
[1:43:11] <%cherrysavestheuniverse> this game is realllllly not optimized for hardware especially with high refresh rates
[1:43:16] <+allups> u cant use anything in the towns? wtf is the point of this
[1:43:18] <%BoxNavy> go check on it monkaS
[1:43:18] <Hellarussian> is there a smell?
[1:43:19] <bob900000> oh no
[1:43:21] <masterfire23> I hate that, I usually have to restart my PC to fix that
[1:43:22] <+allups> check the TV
[1:43:24] <T_Sasquatch> monkaS
[1:43:27] <%vayne_ruu> @PatStaresAt It's a sign to stop playing
[1:43:28] <SovPho> VSync this bitch
[1:43:28] <RWLJr98> is there no music in this game?
[1:43:29] <rosysyntax> remember when Kenshi exploded Pat's PC
[1:43:29] <+MacBeyer> NotLikeThis
[1:43:30] <ullyzeez> yabe
[1:43:30] <%cherrysavestheuniverse> might wanna swing by the workshop on steam and pick up some mods
[1:43:33] <+glgzephyr> you should probably check your shit
[1:43:35] <%AzureGale> Better check yo stuff
[1:43:36] <Slimshazbot> @PatStaresAt If you click on  building, there'll be a tab that tells you what it is (bar, blacksmith, etc)
[1:43:36] <Stigmergy> if kenshi destroys pat's TV i will laugh heartily
[1:43:37] <%walternatorz> has any magic smoke left the machine?
[1:43:39] <+OwlLightningMage> TV at risk
[1:43:40] <%Fooguwu> cursed game
[1:43:40] <%ZegarWildheart> Sup Pat
[1:43:41] <+ReallyBigRocks> wow thats a big fucking scroll bar
[1:43:43] <Jerp> Are you sure it's a monitor issue?  Stream looks fine -- if you're capturing on the same PC you're playing on you might be able to swap between game/monitor/window capture
[1:43:48] <lambishly> LUL
[1:43:52] <jorniev> doubt it dude
[1:43:54] <%aishman> Hey guys I just came in, what's going on with this game?
[1:43:58] <FleshFriend> I mean if its like a god mode mod, maybe
[1:43:59] <shubachi> NotLikeThis
[1:44:01] <+OwlLightningMage> This is literally going exactly the way I expected it to
[1:44:02] <%Dunmarkh> mods will only hurt you
[1:44:03] <%orphan_ash> anyone know a place to find good start tips for the game? I'm interested in picking it up.
[1:44:03] <baronashby> Mods are essential.
[1:44:09] <+allups> ya know when ever a game is to complex just add mods
[1:44:10] <ullyzeez> does the beeg tv have warranty??
[1:44:11] <TrollKing96> @PatStaresAt Pat, you might be better off playing this game on your own time and when you get your bearings with it, maybe try streaming it again if you want.
[1:44:12] <+eggstyr0ne> Kenshi really pat
[1:44:18] <Slimshazbot> @aishman Kenshi is a ludicruously jank and obtuse game and pat jumped in blind.
[1:44:21] <%Dunmarkh> mods are not
[1:44:21] <SovPho> @PatStaresAt I think you should restart and pick the option that starts you off with a group instead, or at least something other than "lmao have fun"
[1:44:22] <+glgzephyr> The sign of a great game!
[1:44:23] <Luizabd> No theyre not
[1:44:24] <%cherrysavestheuniverse> not really but mods are handy
[1:44:26] <%BoxNavy> thats a TERRIBLE endorsement
[1:44:26] <+Solutha> There are some decent guide on Steam
[1:44:27] <%valriot> LUL
[1:44:27] <%Dunmarkh> begone one guy
[1:44:28] <%aishman> Oh. Oh no.
[1:44:29] <bob900000> Jesus
[1:44:29] <+JonWhoLovesFlatWomen> not really
[1:44:30] <%LordSDB> You can play this mod free
[1:44:30] <jorniev> they arenT
[1:44:31] <Stigmergy> i wouldn't say mods are essential
[1:44:31] <DianaTheAscian> thats not good
[1:44:31] <MrFlugaFluga> mods are not needed
[1:44:31] <baronashby> Kenshi learning pays off but it's steep.
[1:44:32] <+OwlLightningMage> @orphan_ash Tobel on youtube has good starter Kenshi guides
[1:44:33] <MrSparkle21> Its like New Vegas
[1:44:33] <+WizoSavage> They aren't essential
[1:44:33] <whatatkins> ONE GUY
[1:44:34] <KingFatality> yup
[1:44:35] <+Kitrane> I do think you should get a handle on this in your own time. And no mods arent essential.
[1:44:36] <%backfire_shot> no they arent
[1:44:37] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Such as Skyrim Kappa
[1:44:37] <Jerp> I played 181 hours pre-release without mods
[1:44:38] <%BoxNavy> shes got a point pat
[1:44:38] <+TheMorilo> ONE GUY
[1:44:39] <Fien111> This game runs off an engine almost as old and bad as Gamebryo
[1:44:40] <rosysyntax> Nah mods are great but not essential
[1:44:41] <+Veraverse> I mean, New Vegas
[1:44:42] <bob900000> new vegas
[1:44:42] <malletman241> yeah id take any excuse too
[1:44:42] <+allups> for skyrim mods are essential
[1:44:42] <+TheOlMitcheroo> ONE GUY
[1:44:42] <randomahole> like DSfix??
[1:44:43] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt And yet you love kotor 2
[1:44:43] <winner_92> ONE GUY
[1:44:44] <%thelaxinator> just like dark souls 1 on pc
[1:44:44] <+Solutha> Mods are not essential at all...
[1:44:46] <Jontman42> one guy?
[1:44:46] <Luizabd> You don't need mods
[1:44:47] <T_Sasquatch> you dont say ? LUL

[1:44:50] <AlexandusLordOfChaos> I mean, mods are essential to Skyrim
[1:44:51] <%patriotrenegade> Like Skyrim
[1:44:53] <HeroToxiko> is it like the arkham thing where it runs on very specific cards
[1:44:53] <+OwlLightningMage> I fucking love this game.
[1:44:54] <+FingaLights> Mods arent essential
[1:44:55] <whatatkins> one guy
[1:44:56] <%BoxNavy> jermaOneguy
[1:44:56] <%ospreyworks> more ff7 classic?
[1:44:56] <+TheOlMitcheroo> ONE GUY WRONG
[1:44:56] <%backfire_shot> One guy mods arent needed
[1:44:56] <+eggstyr0ne> you can naruto run
[1:44:57] <drjohn92> Let’s just focus on the mechanics first
[1:44:58] <Blank9> this looks like shit and a bad game
[1:44:59] <smig> jermaOneguy
[1:44:59] <Rionxgarland> wow mizzurna falls was finally translated fully

[1:45:07] <%orphan_ash> thanks @OwlLightningMage appreciate it
[1:45:09] <+Despera__> @PatStaresAt it's like playing Morrowind and ignoring the main story
[1:45:09] <+glgzephyr> THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVE PLAYED THIS GAME WITH MODS, would you ever go back to vanilla?
[1:45:11] <%Axellogic> Its the self expression thing you hate far as I understand
[1:45:12] <%aishman> @PatStaresAt You didn't watch the Sseth video?
[1:45:13] <Shinny1338> It takes 100 hours of playing to understand Pat
[1:45:13] <+DenpaDev> It's like mount n blade but more obtuswe
[1:45:13] <%THATGUY_789> psa1guy
[1:45:16] <%captain_thickthighs> its like anal its not for everyone
[1:45:18] <+ThiccBoiPlump> is that your dog snoring?
[1:45:19] <BliVru> Games great after midgame but early game first timer is a nightmare
[1:45:22] <%Dunmarkh> @glgzephyr YEAH
[1:45:25] <+eggstyr0ne> kenshi is great you dont need mods
[1:45:25] <Them00n> I would never ask Pat to play this because I know him relatively well.
[1:45:27] <TheA1ternative> Mods are not essential as Ive been playing relatively light on mod content for the past while. They do fix gripes people have @PatStaresAt
[1:45:29] <Slimshazbot> 177 hours in this game, no meme this game is genuinely good, but hella obtuse.
[1:45:29] <+Solutha> Yes I would go back to vanilla
[1:45:31] <@SoFarFetched> Chats hard of hearing Pat.
[1:45:33] <malletman241> im sure it was on in the background
[1:45:33] <%aishman> Sorry dude, I just came into the stream.
[1:45:34] <+Monkeydude07> that's like 200 hours in though
[1:45:37] <Fien111> It's like Dwarf Fort or a Paradox game. It scratches a wierd ass itch almost no one has, don't worry about hating it
[1:45:37] <ullyzeez> watch it again :)
[1:45:37] <+RootVeggie> Wasn't there a quest you could do in the starting town?
[1:45:38] <TheA1ternative> Prayer day is the BEST goddam day
[1:45:38] <%DukeMoose> and says that you start with shit and maybe a dog
[1:45:41] <winner_92> kenshi does not look like a game that was made for real human beings to play
[1:45:42] <%Broand> he didn't HAVE to do any of that stuff technically
[1:45:42] <%Ozavic> The game is slow af and that's part of the pay off, but it is 12000% a game that needs a guide
[1:45:42] <lambishly> This is not a blind stream game it is slow and sprawling
[1:45:44] <%BoxNavy> yo dog thats crazy
[1:45:51] <+eggstyr0ne> go to the fishman islands
[1:45:51] <%backfire_shot> @glgzephyr Yes I play vanilla constantly because i like it more
[1:45:55] <+eggstyr0ne> they are real nice
[1:45:58] <+coolthulhuu> e x p l o r a t i o n
[1:46:00] <Hellarussian> just do it tho
[1:46:02] <%slimmixrp> Its also visually appaling
[1:46:04] <%dave323dave> ez just mine for 2 hours
[1:46:05] <%cherrysavestheuniverse> the appeal is the friends you make along the way and the weird dumb stuff you can do
[1:46:07] <%backfire_shot> mods arent needed
[1:46:09] <masterfire23> the problems is how to get to that without concrete objectives
[1:46:11] <+Despera__> wait until night when they leave
[1:46:12] <+WizoSavage> Build a settlement and the problem comes for you
[1:46:12] <+alpharius88> Find RUKA
[1:46:13] <+allups> i mean it seems like its a grind right off the bat
[1:46:14] <+Monkeydude07> @PatStaresAt talk to ruka
[1:46:14] <blackbaron98> you wait til night and break in
[1:46:15] <+OwlLightningMage> You need to get stronger, or more money, explore, become a slave ect
[1:46:17] <Shinny1338> Someone needs to build Pat a custom start that's actually somewhat good
[1:46:18] <%Ozavic> @glgzephyr I've played vanilla just fine, hush
[1:46:18] <Fien111> It legit takes like 10 hours to get past getting your shit kicked in by bandits and starving
[1:46:18] <TheA1ternative> sneak then steal
[1:46:21] <%MidnightBurst12> you need a lot patience to learn this game
[1:46:21] <theCrowRunner> This reminds me of Mount and Blade
[1:46:24] <TheA1ternative> also yeah ruka is waifu
[1:46:25] <%DukeMoose> Well, you mine copper for an hour, you train stealth was walking in circles for an hour, you talk to dudes and hire them with scraps to mine rocks for you
[1:46:27] <+allups> the floor buttons are so fucking stupid tho
[1:46:27] <%Arweynn> this game seems to have a terminal case of sandbox-itis
[1:46:27] <+killer_squid1990> Honestly I found the slave start to be the most fun
[1:46:28] <T_Sasquatch> How many of you kenshi players actually played it blind tho
[1:46:31] <+WizoSavage> Without a settlement, feel free to explore and own a house
[1:46:32] <+OwlLightningMage> You need to build up your number
[1:46:32] <+Kitrane> I agree with others that you should spend some time off stream getting a handle on this.
[1:46:35] <+glgzephyr> @Ozavic it was a legitimate question, chill
[1:46:38] <+impressionistcowboy> lol can I be the guy that convinces pat to destroy himself on hearts of iron 4?
[1:46:38] <+Solutha> Well first you need money, you can steal, fight, scavenge, mine etc
[1:46:38] <Shinny1338> like a mid tier start instead of rock bottom
[1:46:38] <%captain_thickthighs> this seem like a game people sink there whole lives into and build on it
[1:46:39] <%BoxNavy> chat how does he make more money to hire people tho
[1:46:42] <+allups> i guess in advaced combat itll be useful but damn
[1:46:48] <%aishman> WAIT WHAT
[1:46:49] <Them00n> The easy way to get money is mine for 3 hours then level strength buy carrying ore back and forth.
[1:46:54] <T_Sasquatch> looool
[1:46:57] <%AzureGale> Are you talking about the video?
[1:46:57] <%DukeMoose> you watch fights between bandits and guards or soldiers and then loot the corpses or kidnap one if they have a listed bounty
[1:46:58] <drjohn92> @patstaresat first mine for money. Then buy building materials to make a shack. Then hire help. Then start fighting to train stats.
[1:47:00] <%AzureGale> The video was good
[1:47:00] <HeroToxiko> lmfao wut
[1:47:02] <KingFatality> that guy didn't play single player
[1:47:03] <krnksk> LUL
[1:47:03] <malletman241> no you dont
[1:47:05] <lambishly> Play Kenshi off stream first
[1:47:05] <+D00msDayDan> speaking of kotaku, omegalul at them reporting on a fake tweet saying halo got delayed again
[1:47:06] <T_Sasquatch> imagine someone at kotaku playing this
[1:47:06] <Shinny1338> I did because I liked the old Open RPG custom maps on SC broodwars
[1:47:07] <+OwlLightningMage> NO
[1:47:08] <+allups> they where probably valid too
[1:47:08] <+eggstyr0ne> no
[1:47:08] <+Despera__> no
[1:47:10] <+Jiggisnipe> what should Pat do?
[1:47:10] <mouse_1312> wait til night, steal, sell goods in another town is a good option
[1:47:14] <%walternatorz> @PatStaresAt I think the takeaway from this stream is you are amazing for pulling in 1.1k viewers for this jank.
[1:47:14] <+TheOlMitcheroo> NO
[1:47:14] <+TheMorilo> no
[1:47:14] <AlexandusLordOfChaos> no you can steal
[1:47:14] <lambishly> no
[1:47:15] <%lilytastic> All those other beginnings seemed to give you some kind of hook
[1:47:16] <%captain_thickthighs> i dont get rts so its fine
[1:47:16] <%ospreyworks> is the stream stuttering and repeating for anyone else or is it my internet?
[1:47:17] <jorniev> training i think
[1:47:18] <JetpackMcQuack> Quality of life LUL
[1:47:19] <%Archphronimos> no, you can go get in fights now
[1:47:19] <+coolthulhuu> i mean we have been telling you things to do
[1:47:19] <%Dunmarkh> powerplay walking into that bar and not talking to anyone
[1:47:19] <+glgzephyr> then WHAT SHOULD HE DO!?
[1:47:19] <Sowlith> find people fighting and loot their stuff when they get knocked out
[1:47:20] <AlexandusLordOfChaos> or lure bandits into guards
[1:47:20] <%Broand> I mean if you can beat someone up and take THEIR sword
[1:47:20] <its_kleine> you can lure bandits to town and steal their stuff for money
[1:47:21] <%Landralin1996> Stealing is a good option but you mught need to save scum
[1:47:21] <blackbaron98> no
[1:47:23] <AlexandusLordOfChaos> tons of options
[1:47:24] <RWLJr98> Help him out Kenshi players  :(
[1:47:25] <codizle> Keep exploring till you find something
[1:47:25] <bob900000> yes
[1:47:25] <%DukeMoose> You can Kite bandits into towns so the guards beat them up to loot the bodies
[1:47:25] <mike2hands> did pat became jesus yet?
[1:47:25] <%cherrysavestheuniverse> kite starving bandits to the town gates and use their gear thats the other way
[1:47:26] <%BoxNavy> yeah its definitely the game hating the monitor
[1:47:26] <+OwlLightningMage> There are different way to get stronger or more money or more people
[1:47:26] <Luizabd> YOu could steel,loot,buy and ressel goods
[1:47:27] <ullyzeez> games not for everyone pat
[1:47:27] <Fien111> It's not the only option, but it's the preferred
[1:47:28] <ThirdPersonPhil> just cheat money in?
[1:47:30] <Stigmergy> lure bandits to guards, bandits get killed, loot bandits
[1:47:30] <winner_92> @ospreyworks stream is stable for me
[1:47:35] <Slimshazbot> @PatStaresAt Mining isn't the ONLY thing, but it's the easiest to do for a new player, sadly also the worst for streaming.
[1:47:37] <%BoxNavy> just find bandits 4Head
[1:47:37] <lambishly> Kite them better
[1:47:38] <%cherrysavestheuniverse> you gotta get closer to them
[1:47:38] <+glgzephyr> @captain_thickthighs This is not an RTS. those who are calling it an RTS don't know what that is
[1:47:39] <%MidnightBurst12> too many options to count
[1:47:39] <%Dunmarkh> kite them
[1:47:39] <baronashby> Sneak and steal a sword. Loot bodies.
[1:47:39] <+WizoSavage> Remember as a robot you're not startving, Food is the primary objective that you circumvented by choosing that race @PatStaresAt
[1:47:40] <Broken_Sonex> .....Yeah......I don't know how you can do anything
[1:47:43] <%Archphronimos> as long as you don't die, getting beat up is a good thing
[1:47:44] <+OwlLightningMage> There are many different ways to get a bigger number
[1:47:44] <%Arweynn> not on our end
[1:47:46] <+ReallyBigRocks> I think they stopped because you got too far away from them
[1:47:46] <bob900000> screen went black for a second
[1:47:46] <%ospreyworks> thanks @winner_92
[1:47:48] <+Solutha> No you got too far away
[1:47:48] <Luizabd> They stoped because you were too far
[1:47:50] <ThirdPersonPhil> Cheat Engine
[1:47:53] <Shinny1338> Just have to stop autorunning
[1:47:53] <+Kitrane> Be a miner, Scavenger, or Thief. all legitimate ways to earn cash early
[1:47:54] <penitentpendant> If it's causing monitor problems, I'd rather he not risk his TV over this
[1:47:55] <+cherrysavestheuniverse> gotta be close enough to them that they keep chasing you
[1:47:56] <Them00n> Mine for money, recruit a party of 5 or so then level combat skills. then build a Base.
[1:47:56] <+Goshism> Games shit play some streets of rogue for easy fun times
[1:47:56] <%thelaxinator> This seems like a cool game to play on your own but poison for streaming
[1:47:59] <baronashby> There's plenty of ruins out in the wild.
[1:48:00] <Shinny1338> they can't run as fast
[1:48:00] <Ipsenscastle> they didnt stop because you got close to town, you just outran them
[1:48:03] <baronashby> Nearby to this town.
[1:48:03] <%DukeMoose> you kite them, you reset their aggro by selecting to attack them and then running again
[1:48:04] <Slimshazbot> @PatStaresAt And you can kite bandits and other monsters, I usually play the hardest start and make early cash by drawing these giant bugs into the guards
[1:48:06] <jorniev> find bandits lure them to the gates so the guard kills them then loot them
[1:48:06] <baronashby> Bunch of swords.
[1:48:11] <+FollowDatDolphin> no you can do whatever, it's a pure sand rpg. do whatever, talk to people, make your own fun, etc...
[1:48:14] <+Jiggisnipe> try luring them again but stick closer to them? idk
[1:48:16] <+allups> play Elix its janky but its fun the story is decent and its good to laugh at
[1:48:21] <%Dunmarkh> you didn't talk to any npcs, powerplay
[1:48:22] <+eggstyr0ne> you can steal for easy money, become a scav, hunt, trade goods in one region and sell for a higher amount in others for starting money
[1:48:24] <BliVru> @patstaresat Hey man if you didnt like it is ok its not for everyone
[1:48:25] <Meltgar> TLDR from pats adventures?
[1:48:25] <%thelaxinator> It's like, I'm sure Morrowind ain't great for streaming
[1:48:30] <alter_eagle> Playing a human is more fun to start cuz the goal is to not starve
[1:48:31] <DianaTheAscian> what look?
[1:48:31] <Meltgar> Has he been killed yet? Kappa
[1:48:33] <T_Sasquatch> fuck elex
[1:48:36] <ullyzeez> we all gave you that look
[1:48:36] <%Dunmarkh> no ruka, sorry boys
[1:48:38] <winner_92> to be honest the monitor problems seem like reason enough to play something else if it's getting annoying
[1:48:41] <%cherrysavestheuniverse> scavanging gear is a good idea early game
[1:48:42] <+allups> @Meltgar Nothing happened
[1:48:43] <%BoxNavy> ball
[1:48:49] <RWLJr98> It reminds me of a survival game, build up from nothing. which I love. but doesnt explain anything to you
[1:48:51] <iq_dropper> @meltgar lost and confused
[1:48:52] <%ospreyworks> totally free to play something else, Pat. don't feel obligated
[1:48:52] <%walternatorz> someone neglected their cactus
[1:48:53] <lambishly> @PatStaresAt It's cult for a reason lol
[1:48:56] <+OwlLightningMage> Ball
[1:48:56] <+ReallyBigRocks> @Meltgar There have been 2 ass beatings so far
[1:48:59] <ToneBacas> looks like a cactus
[1:49:00] <winner_92> Ball with Spike
[1:49:00] <%captain_thickthighs> @glgzephyr what? i mean is there are some things people dont just like. ie i can't do rts or visual novels so i couldn't play aegis rim
[1:49:01] <+Kitrane> that's one big ass cactus
[1:49:01] <%DukeMoose> yea its world fluff
[1:49:03] <%aishman> @PatStaresAt If you bounce off of this super hard, does that mean Fortnight stream?
[1:49:03] <jorniev> plant
[1:49:03] <dragoon001914> Morrowind isn't great for streaming but it's the best Elder Scrolls game
[1:49:04] <+Big_Hudson> is this new age Fallout?
[1:49:05] <Fien111> Yeah, no words can properly describe how niche this game is. You basically develop stockholmes for it or just give up in two hours
[1:49:07] <Shinny1338> "What is that thing" so it begins
[1:49:08] <+RahkshiLord> @thelaxinator morrowind is a structured rpg with a story and quests and a direction to go in from the start
[1:49:12] <Jerp> @PatStaresAt generally you can sort of poke and prod at it and you'll learn something or get something useful out of it -- it really depends on what you want to do though, there's a lot of ways to make money or find gear or acquire allies, start an empire or become stronger, etc.
[1:49:15] <%BoxNavy> cant wait for the podcast on monday
[1:49:21] <+eggstyr0ne> pat go north into the foglands and get the strongest npc to join you, BEEP
[1:49:22] <baronashby> There is cool stuff out there.
[1:49:26] <+Big_Hudson> !fortnite
[1:49:29] <+glgzephyr> @captain_thickthighs Ah, got it
[1:49:31] <+FingaLights> As someone who loves this game, I was also surprized and confused LUL
[1:49:32] <%walternatorz> is that a giant green onion?
[1:49:35] <Stigmergy> unironically just run out into the wilderness for a bit
[1:49:36] <+OwlLightningMage> Pat will die in the foglands
[1:49:38] <Baddict> flush this bitch
[1:49:38] <Giztech> there is a youtuber that did a voiceover story while they were playing this. It was good
[1:49:38] <@SoFarFetched> FORTNITE?

[1:49:40] <theanora1> Fortnite?
[1:49:40] <+allups> ?

[1:49:45] <jorniev> ok
[1:49:46] <aiutare47> Perhaps you could try a different beginning? some other ones have more structure. @PatStaresAt
[1:49:47] <$RealThiele> LUL
[1:49:47] <%aishman> FORTNITE
[1:49:49] <%cherrysavestheuniverse> yeah that would help troubleshoot it
[1:49:49] <DianaTheAscian> is this gonna be a fortinte stream?

[1:50:20] <KaiserMario> I mean... There's more people watching this than average... But damn it's unexciting as hell LUL
[1:50:22] <RWLJr98> When did Kenshi get the FORTNITE update Kappa
[1:50:22] <%justcallmebobplease> UGH THAT SHAKE

[1:53:01] <%BoxNavy> item :)
[1:53:01] <SovPho> there are repair packs for skeletons
[1:53:04] <SovPho> they're stupid expensive
[1:53:04] <%metalicblackcherry> see how number goes down
[1:53:04] <aiutare47> you will not get back up your health is too low. You need a party member to pick you up
[1:53:05] <BliVru> Na you are dying now just reload
[1:53:06] <lambishly> Robot is not a good start for beginners
[1:53:06] <+WizoSavage> skeleton repair things
[1:53:07] <rasamune> Try singing
[1:53:07] <rosysyntax> gotta find repair kits... or play as human lol
[1:53:08] <aiutare47> but you dont have one
[1:53:09] <%cherrysavestheuniverse> oh its going up your chest damage is not going down thats bad

[1:53:11] <%Dunmarkh> bought a repair kit ion squinn
[1:53:12] <+Solutha> You have a more serious wound now
[1:53:12] <Hellarussian> with your healing thing
[1:53:12] <Luizabd> You couldn't pick a worst race to start
[1:53:14] <Fien111> Robots need special healing kits and beds, they're hard as shit in early game
[1:53:14] <baronashby> Bandage
[1:53:15] <%aishman> I think you're just dead dude
[1:53:15] <%Jekado> oh you are dying.
[1:53:20] <+OwlLightningMage> That's why starting as a skeleton is hard if you don't know what you're doing
[1:53:21] <+glgzephyr> @baronashby is there even anything to spoil?
[1:53:22] <Slimshazbot> yup
[1:53:22] <winner_92> this game seems like Twitch Chat Poison

[1:54:55] <Zeif00> Do it again
[1:54:57] <Slimshazbot> @PatStaresAt Slave start is HARDER, pick a start like wandering trader, or the one that starts with a bunch of guys
[1:54:58] <baronashby> Guards will heal you after beating your shit in.
[1:54:59] <jorniev> HARD MODE BABY
[1:55:02] <$oAlec687> is the tv breaking?
[1:55:05] <Parapattern> Baby Snore
[1:55:06] <+FollowDatDolphin> don't start slave oh god
[1:55:06] <RWLJr98> Looks just like you
[1:55:07] <Fien111> Monitor flicker isn't entirely uncommon with this game
[1:55:09] <+allups> i dont like how the default slave looks like me
[1:55:10] <FleshFriend> nice stache
[1:55:11] <aiutare47> At least with a slave start he gets free XP and a clear goal
[1:55:14] <%JamesJaystar> JamesJaystar subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months!

[1:55:25] <crabmeat495> Free beat down incoming
[1:55:29] <rosysyntax> prepare to starve
[1:55:31] <Shinny1338> He's about to get beat down
[1:55:35] <%GeneralSCPatton> Sorry about the yelling. Just trying to talk above the crowd. My favorite start is slave because they never let you starve and you can grind a lot of things before breaking out.
[1:55:36] <Slimshazbot> @PatStaresAt Slave start is HARDER, pick a start like wandering trader, or the one that starts with a bunch of guys
[1:55:40] <+OwlLightningMage> Slaves are automattically feed
[1:55:40] <+ValdakMX> kenshi is fun but grindy AF

[1:55:45] <crabmeat495> You gotta be arrested to become a slave
[1:55:48] <+AnimationAtNight> PAT PAUSE THE GAME

[1:57:11] <%rios> uh oh
[1:57:14] <lord_bucketface> Still on my first game of Kenshi.... 76 hours in LUL
[1:57:15] <+eggstyr0ne> being a slave is a blessing in this game
[1:57:15] <tengel66> that was great
[1:57:16] <jorniev> thats kenshi
[1:57:16] <akareynolds88> disco?
[1:57:18] <SovPho> hey pat this game is kinda rough btw
[1:57:19] <KingFatality> yeah kenshi is fun but it's stream poison
[1:57:23] <%Dunmarkh> you didn't get in a cage pat
[1:57:24] <Orenjevel> great stream
[1:57:24] <%thelaxinator> loose cable maybe
[1:57:25] <%sabertoothzombie> disco time!
[1:57:26] <cheapdoc> Kenshi stares at Pat
[1:57:26] <%bassoontyphoon> you tried it
[1:57:26] <+OwlLightningMage> Pat got sold into slavery
[1:57:28] <Fien111> Pat I love this game but it's a complete dumpster fire and stream poison. Whoever said you should stream is is a fool
[1:57:28] <lambishly> LUL
[1:57:28] <+Veraverse> Fortnite?
[1:57:30] <Siconia> That's no beuno
[1:57:30] <ChungusQuest> CURSED
[1:57:34] <$oAlec687> rip tv
[1:57:34] <+JonWhoLovesFlatWomen> oh noooo
[1:57:35] <+allups> hope ur TV isnt fucked same thing happened to my moms 4K
[1:57:37] <Ipsenscastle> LG OLED god tv
[1:57:39] <Khester824> Kotaku was right
[1:57:41] <theanora1> is the new TV busted?
[1:57:41] <%YPFrost> YPFrost subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! 
[1:57:42] <T_Sasquatch> Kenshi 10/10 would highly recommend
[1:57:45] <lambishly> tbh this is about what I expected
[1:57:48] <rosysyntax> And so, Kenshi literally broke Pat's TV
[1:57:48] <%BoxNavy> is pat bailing
[1:57:49] <+glgzephyr> I would legitimately rather have watched Fortnite, and I hate that gaame
[1:57:51] <Slimshazbot> @KingFatality Can make for great streams if you know what you're doing. Tomato and Criken's kenshi streams were amazing
[1:57:54] <Mr_Rakjo> RIP kenshi WTF IS GOING ON
[1:57:54] <sendart> uh oh how that warranty?
[1:57:54] <jorniev> its a SLOOOOOW burn of a game

[1:57:57] <+Damie904> !uptime
[1:57:58] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 58m.
[1:57:59] <KaiserMario> More Disco? I'm Disco!
[1:58:00] <+allups> o fuck he just bought the olet too
[1:58:00] <+OwlLightningMage> People wanted to see the blind run of Kenshi to see a man melt live on stream
[1:58:00] <+Veraverse> I guess Kenshi is the best game in the world
[1:58:03] <+panlakes> Oh, I just got here. Did pat get confused and brainmelt?
[1:58:04] <%GeneralSCPatton> Slaves are barely kept from starvation, and get to carry around extra shackles as training weights for epic gains
[1:58:06] <aiutare47> I love kenshi, but its not Pats game. Especially not the early game
[1:58:07] <SovPho> fstream
[1:58:09] <thepardack> Kenshi personally attacked Pat's TV and spat on his face
[1:58:10] <Orenjevel> rip
[1:58:11] <%AzureGale> F
[1:58:12] <cheapdoc> I hope he bails, that game had no direction
[1:58:12] <Hellarussian> oh
[1:58:12] <jorniev> woah
