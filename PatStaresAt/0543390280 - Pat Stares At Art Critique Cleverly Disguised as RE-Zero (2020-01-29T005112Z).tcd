[0:05:54] <%EndlessScrapper> Okay so Rebecca can mix herbs. But the other Star members can as well making her job seem a little pointless...but lets just assume thats standard Stars training. If Chris learned it then he taught it to his sister. Then why does Leon, a cop from New York, know how to mix herbs?
[0:05:55] <+Remery_> Pat will perform interpertative dance?
[0:05:58] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I mean...Performance IS an umbrella terminology. Pretty much anything and everything could be considered art and/or performance. Not necessarily GOOD art, but still art.

[0:14:58] <+Ghostfaceninja53534> JUST GET THE DORITO DUST ON YOUR PHONE ITS FINE
[0:15:00] <%spiritofmojave> No that's carving marble
[0:15:00] <toyforus235> Caveman Pat
[0:15:01] <$CorneliousRR> As an artist that is accurate
[0:15:01] <mateonofeo13> Every game artist
[0:15:01] <Zaphire_Saucypants> It REALLY is. At least that's how it feels sometimes.
[0:15:02] <%blondie_ow> Is Pat showing off the birds and the bees?
[0:15:03] <%JJCheeker> I would
[0:15:03] <tusk102> love you pat your horrid goblin man
[0:15:04] <Themostdelicious> That's basically how drawing works.
[0:15:05] <%Ranryu692> That Xbone controller is a man now
[0:15:05] <rytisone> Arts and Crafts 2
[0:15:05] <Zedimonx5> Time to get Pat a tablet!
[0:15:05] <%RainyStudios> Press X to art
[0:15:06] <+OwlLightningMage> We should donate for Pat to get a tablet
[0:15:07] <%draugrix> so that's what I was doing wrong all these years
[0:15:08] <%Evil_John_Cena> are the doritos coated with something?
[0:15:09] <KLouDraws> As an Art lady myself, I can concur that is art
[0:15:09] <%miguelrod777> Unga bunga pat
[0:15:09] <%GrayMatterMiner> mash it
[0:15:14] <%damienlunas> Pat's sanity is at risk
[0:15:14] <$JellyAndKake> Pat's can't cook. all they know is look at chat, pet Elmo, eat Dorito and be wrong
[0:15:15] <%happyface699> CRUSh it
[0:15:16] <%NitronStreams> So whens Pat opening up commissions
[0:15:20] <marvel877> Do you still have a DS, Pat? Trying drawing in that.
[0:15:23] <%Darren716> I mean...\
[0:15:23] <Nina96> if only
[0:15:23] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> I mean, you can.
[0:15:24] <holydeviant1> "You have your art tablet, and you just - you just, like this:" [clack, clack]
[0:15:25] <+OwlLightningMage> I would legitimately pay for Plague to teach Pat basic drawing
[0:15:28] <%stevesekai> I tried playing RE 0 last night and beat the whole train without saving then immediately died to the flaming zombies after the crash
[0:15:28] <Themostdelicious> You'd wrinkle up and die.
[0:15:29] <%Monkeyweed21> JUST BUTTCHUG
[0:15:29] <ECRead> I mean... you CAN
[0:15:29] <mateonofeo13> Ok Frank
[0:15:30] <person181> can't do that with the gout
[0:15:30] <%tiaramaki> You'd die, Pat
[0:15:30] <%firesoftheforge> I mean you can but it hurts
[0:15:31] <%honeyman18> You gotta insert the wacom pen tip into your pen and slap the screen till art happens.
[0:15:31] <%JJCheeker> i Do that every night
[0:15:31] <%BallerSwagBro9k> USE BLEACH
[0:15:32] <+McSoliace> i mean you can
[0:15:32] <scrumbotime> Not with that attitude
[0:15:32] <%miguelrod777> I mean
[0:15:32] <Mr_Strut> That's just called drinking
[0:15:32] <%Darren716> Only cowards say that
[0:15:34] <%corepool> well u could
[0:15:35] <IminyourBase> the inside of your inside parts are sterile
[0:15:36] <%RNGbob> Giving ringo a run for his money @AngriestPat
[0:15:37] <filialpails> if only I could be so grossly fermented
[0:15:37] <JoelFleran> yo
[0:15:38] <Silverkry2> You get the yakuza remastered collection?
[0:15:40] <%trustycoyote> What?! Then all that whiskey I had was for nothing?!
[0:15:41] <+gimmickypizza> :)
[0:15:41] <%spiritofmojave> You could and die at once! win win
[0:15:42] <Themostdelicious> Bathe in alcohol
[0:15:42] <$Afterman_> not with that attitude
[0:15:43] <%duneblythe> have you considered therapy?
[0:15:45] <%maskofmichael> That's what acid is for
[0:15:47] <%ArgosDanger> ArgosDanger subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 18 months! Thanks for keeping me distracted from my country burning down around me. You deserve my filthy slightly singed Australian money
[0:15:48] <%gespenst25> To alcohol, the cause of, and solution to, all of life's problems.
[0:15:48] <+Mittensbro> lewd
[0:15:49] <mateonofeo13> Ósmosis Pat
[0:15:51] <Admiral_PopnFresh> I have no idea, you mean emotionally?
[0:15:52] <%Darren716> Funnels can do magical things
[0:15:52] <+OwlLightningMage> We need streams of Plague teaching Pat to draw
[0:15:53] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> deep tissue
[0:15:53] <%trueherobappo> DINO CRISIS FAN REMAKE LOOKS DOPE
[0:15:54] <Mr_Strut> That's what drinking does
[0:15:56] <%skizzuto> just drink until you have alcohol poisoning
[0:15:57] <roguestormtrooper> Like the marrow?
[0:15:58] <%JJCheeker> Like an alcohol enema
[0:15:58] <%Asagi66> Now to print that art on a shirt
[0:16:01] <frozenottsel> Remember, people call David Cage an artist. So you can be one too
[0:16:01] <%happyface699> @silverkry2 Doesn’t come out till the 11th but I will
[0:16:02] <%SoFarFetched> HES IN THERAPY

[0:16:11] <+Ell1ot> Pat just did a art therapy

[0:16:36] <+SenorCounter> Triffling!
[0:16:38] <%yet_another_brony> paige just said there already therapyint
[0:16:40] <+OwlLightningMage> You should make more art
[0:16:40] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Really, this streaming thing IS his therapy, I think. We, as chat, are basically his therapists. And yes, it's fuckin rude.
[0:16:42] <linniix> No Redbull ?

[0:17:05] <%NitronStreams> LUL
[0:17:05] <$AgentTexes> It's now my background and I'll love it forever. Thank you, @AngriestPat.
[0:17:06] <tusk102> no pat you are a very good artist
[0:17:06] <%king_wragles> EVERYONE could benefit from seeing a therapist a couple of times every few years
[0:17:07] <Animorphimagi> don't call people trifling bitches....
[0:17:08] <%PopulousNix> probly, but it's expensive :(
[0:17:08] <DensityD> the truth is a cruel mistress that strikes deeps
[0:17:08] <%vaporousTippler> Yeah, but it's easier to just put all that in donation messages.
[0:17:10] <Zaphire_Saucypants> no shaming of mental health.
[0:17:10] <%Laecerelius> "I duno about that, friendo"
[0:17:12] <cureneckbeard> "But what if he DID spit in my hair!"
[0:17:14] <KLouDraws> Therapy is the good stuff, weell as long as you have a good therapist lol
[0:17:15] <frozenottsel> I'm not a therapist, but I don't think a therapist would think that you trolling people is that big a deal.
[0:17:16] <mateonofeo13> CoolStoryBob
[0:17:19] <%hntronium> I could get that from talking to my grandfathe
[0:17:21] <%NitronStreams> THAT WAS GREAT
[0:17:23] <$Kenzo2000> “Maybe, but no.”

[0:17:56] <%TinyLittleDancer> Therapy is where I call you a liar
[0:17:57] <ECRead> @RainyStudios <3

[0:17:59] <PunishedMercer_> complete with stuffing their face with chips.
[0:18:01] <%trueherobappo> @AngriestPat Oh, my mistake.
[0:18:02] <%duneblythe> As an American, access to therapy is difficult to acquire.
[0:18:03] <NoHoldsBarredProductions> I would pay good money for a therapist to sit there, eat Doritos and be like "I dunno, man."
[0:18:03] <+gimmickypizza> :)
[0:18:05] <PunishedMercer_> that's therapy
[0:18:06] <%happyface699> T H U R P Y
[0:18:10] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> or dealing with people
[0:18:10] <%draugrix> @angriestpat therapist are licenced to say " naw bruh your wrong"

[0:20:54] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Paige is weird, that's it
[0:20:54] <DensityD> it's mind goblins fighting other mind goblins

[0:20:59] <+kreepykulture> @jaller101514 I feel like pat would be like me in that animal crossing has no definitive goal and therefore isnt worth the time to play
[0:21:00] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> TV Volumes
[0:21:01] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Remember the RE2R run where it took you almost 20 minutes to leave the pistol in the item box, because you could clear the rest of the game with the shells you had left?
[0:21:02] <%yet_another_brony> yes ocf
[0:21:02] <%peachy996> It's from Paige's Heavy Rain stream
[0:21:02] <%Aydarkzero> seems like it
[0:21:02] <rcand9> help us learn pat
[0:21:03] <%Rngiddion> you have to be smart enough
[0:21:04] <+Fill783> Choese
[0:21:05] <person181> you need DEEP lore to know it
[0:21:06] <MayorRev> Paige sees the number 12 and just NUTS
[0:21:07] <%MrDonTacos_> well no shit
[0:21:07] <%augusm> I too have the OCD, so much so that I panic when people start telling me their OCD rituals because I'm afraid I'll end up doing it too

[0:21:24] <Nina96> u just did
[0:21:24] <rytisone> that showed him
[0:21:25] <mateonofeo13> Where is Plague
[0:21:25] <tusk102> YOUR ART WAS GREAT
[0:21:25] <%MrNoobMcSalt> Damn pat, did you get sponsored by the gamer triangles?
[0:21:26] <DracaenaLeaf> show him great art
[0:21:26] <%Chatterbox1991> litterally went and got a bag of doritos before the stream started
[0:21:27] <%bluebiscuit94> The Numbers PAT, what do they mean??
[0:21:29] <deviljhojho_> draw some borderline furry porn
[0:21:30] <%griffball13> pat wins
[0:21:31] <garbageheaphound> you absolutely shoerd him
[0:21:32] <+OwlLightningMage> Good art Pat. Make more art
[0:21:33] <+Remery_> Plague can help you make SFW drawings
[0:21:34] <%Aydarkzero> you actually defeated Plague
[0:21:35] <Zaphire_Saucypants> you fell into the art trap that Plague set down.
[0:21:36] <%spongeofmystery> Petty revenge is the best motivator
[0:21:37] <%JJCheeker> I did that s*** too
[0:21:37] <%BlueMoonBlues> I dont think he meant to call you a bad artist
[0:21:38] <Fujiwara_92> THAT ART WAS GREAT
[0:21:38] <+Ell1ot> you posted the best arts for twitter
[0:21:39] <Themostdelicious> BILLY
[0:21:43] <deviljhojho_> shoard him
[0:21:43] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @trueherobappo 95 isn't a multiple of 12
[0:21:44] <garbageheaphound> meant to say shown
[0:21:45] <%RNGbob> plague just wants a art rival
[0:21:45] <fuchard1996> boomer drink
[0:21:47] <rcand9> plague is accurate and scary
[0:21:49] <%miguelrod777> I FOOLED YOU INTO DOING ART
[0:21:49] <garbageheaphound> NO WAIT SHOED
[0:21:50] <DensityD> trap cards
[0:21:51] <garbageheaphound> GUCK
[0:21:51] <%TenguGemini> sometimes it helps knowing that someone has worse mind goblins than me
[0:21:51] <ElenaManetta> its not furry girls so it's not art
[0:21:52] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Trap card
[0:21:53] <buffmurffy> i mean that wasn't a real effort though, you were being ironic
[0:21:53] <%WackyXmand> Pat will be the next Kevin Brown
[0:21:53] <deviljhojho_> welcome to the world of artists
[0:21:55] <%ospreyworks> You're a good art patron. You always give your artists their due and hype them up.
[0:21:56] <%AMajorTom> You can't call it bad because I didn't even try
[0:21:56] <%peachy996> You're perfectly secure in your bad art
[0:21:58] <$afronooch> I can't believe Pat killed Plague
[0:21:58] <Themostdelicious> BIH LEE
[0:21:58] <%SpcOpsBear> I also have OCD, but I have that weird manageable OCD where I prefer to have things in sets (like eating the last few fries on my plate in pairs of similarly lengthed fries)
[0:22:00] <bananawarrior1> PPPPPPPPATTTTTT
[0:22:04] <garbageheaphound> I meant Showed
[0:22:05] <FirearmsInstructor> @frozenottsel Did you just come up with that on the spot? Or was did you get that from somewhere? I'm using that for the rest of my life. <3
[0:22:05] <%Nope80808> i dont use twitter what happened?
[0:22:07] <%trueherobappo> @Sphincter_Spelunker OMG THAT'S HILARIOUS
[0:22:07] <mateonofeo13> Not the Fart pits but the Art pits
[0:22:07] <+Reaverund> Plague draws porn, and nobody criticizes porn.
[0:22:08] <%duneblythe> I literally just woke up in Woolie started hosting you
[0:22:10] <%jorniev> ART IS A HUSTLE
[0:22:10] <%Delenay> doesnt work!
[0:22:11] <IminyourBase> by leaning in to the bit you are only proving plague correct. by failing so hard you have succeeded, freeing you from the consequences of failure. BOOM PYSCHOANALYZED
[0:22:13] <+Remery_> Plague will convert you into a furry artist
[0:22:13] <rytisone> reverse psychology
[0:22:14] <$Kenzo2000> “Haha you are an artist now loser” -Plague
[0:22:15] <%supersugoisenpai1> Terrible idea
[0:22:16] <%EndlessScrapper> Funny thing about Plague is his sfw art is somehow way more erotic then his straight up porn
[0:22:18] <Zaphire_Saucypants> oof
[0:22:20] <%Laecerelius> WOOOF
[0:22:20] <%D3rrtyD4n> thats fucked up

[0:22:25] <+chaumiester> Was that your mother?
[0:22:31] <DensityD> who was the other Art Lady in chat? What do you think of Plague's mind ploy for Pat?
[0:22:31] <Zaphire_Saucypants> that fuckin sucks
[0:22:32] <Fujiwara_92> yeah, that happens
[0:22:32] <+keyoray> yea, also parenting is not universal!
[0:22:32] <ElenaManetta> it works coming from a RIVAL

[0:23:06] <%GrayMatterMiner> jimmys a punk
[0:23:06] <%RainyStudios> Jimmy 5 legs
[0:23:08] <shoobieredgrave> u tapped into something with that
[0:23:08] <%takiyami> It works with your parents but you should only bet on it if it's an established aspect of your relationship with your kid.
[0:23:08] <Mr_Strut> No
[0:23:10] <%spiritofmojave> Fucking hate that SODIUM CHLORIDE jerk
[0:23:10] <GnarlyJarlie> Jimmy was my best friend at oen time but he was also totally that guy
[0:23:10] <%miguelrod777> no
[0:23:10] <+ALazo> It worked when a teacher did it to me. Though I'm pretty sure the intent was never encouragement there
[0:23:10] <Decimated_body> Jimmy is a piece of shit
[0:23:10] <@ShockzNDrawe> it works on ssaryn and strident though Pat
[0:23:11] <garbageheaphound> MOTIVATED
[0:23:13] <%trueherobappo> That was the face a man trying to get out the last poop.
[0:23:13] <%MrDonTacos_> yeah i remember that asshole, but his name was Patrick
[0:23:14] <roguestormtrooper> ye
[0:23:16] <%honeyman18> That's an image about to be of Pat shitting himself on stream
[0:23:18] <+AlastorSlain> if you didn't know a jimmy then YOU WERE JIMMY
[0:23:19] <%Aeoneth> Victory through Spite
[0:23:19] <%hntronium> Jimmy eventually became a doctor
[0:23:21] <+OwlLightningMage> Ronnie
[0:23:22] <+keyoray> I had a Quincy
[0:23:22] <rytisone> Eric Sparrow
[0:23:23] <+Remery_> Jimmy was a short little mouthy bitch that got a spanking by the teacher in front of the class
[0:23:23] <FirearmsInstructor> OH ERIC. Yeah fuck Eric.
[0:23:23] <%Madbearv> His name's Gabe
[0:23:23] <j2_daboy> jimmy was a racecar driver
[0:23:26] <ElenaManetta> FUCK trevor
[0:23:26] <%TheWinged7> spite works, just being told not to do something doesnt
[0:23:27] <%trueherobappo> That guys name for me was my mom..
[0:23:28] <Mr_Strut> Actually I think I was that guy
[0:23:29] <garbageheaphound> OH THATS THE WORST
[0:23:30] <%trueherobappo> and sister..
[0:23:30] <AllJoeShow> jim jim's words can cut straight to the bone
[0:23:30] <person181> trevor is a bad name
[0:23:34] <%griffball13> right behind pat
[0:23:34] <FirearmsInstructor> If you're here: Fuck you Eric.
[0:23:34] <%maskofmichael> That guy was me, to me
[0:23:35] <JoelFleran> mine was everyone
[0:23:35] <%linkster291> Seeing the new name for the stream, is Pat starting a high class shit posting stream?
[0:23:36] <DensityD> SwiftRage SwiftRage SwiftRage TREVOR
[0:23:36] <ElenaManetta> yeah HOWS THE WEATHER UP THERE
[0:23:38] <Zaphire_Saucypants> SO the conclusion here is...Parents or teachers gotta pay a kid named Jimmy to fuck you up for your own good.
[0:23:38] <Fujiwara_92> second smarter sure...
[0:23:39] <%JJCheeker> my mom abandoned me in my teenage years
[0:23:40] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Trevor Phillips?
[0:23:40] <+wmeldrum> tall = high and mighty
[0:23:45] <%fruit_pie_the_magician> That face needs to be an emote called "coronary"

[0:23:51] <+TrevSmith222> But you ARE dumb,
[0:23:53] <%Aeoneth> Yeaah Definitely Victory through Spite
[0:23:54] <Admiral_PopnFresh> You guys know what Hungrybox's Dad told him as a kid? "You'll be good, but you'll never be the best."
[0:23:56] <+CavemanInCave> do you mean figuratively
[0:24:01] <Enemy_In_Disguise> Your Vergil
[0:24:07] <%Laecerelius> The tallest are always the smartest, it's just science
[0:24:08] <%ElkRiverDog> My jimmy bet I wouldn’t bit his finger because I was a germaphobe. He got three stitches.

[0:39:01] <%Chatterbox1991> MrDestructoid500 me and the people on the CSN discord were talking about Resident Evil and the prospects for the future, and it begs the question; what do you personally want for Resident Evil 8 in terms of story hooks, overall design, gimmicks features ect. For me, i think a truncated, self-contained story in the vein of Resident Evil 4/7 works the best, as for the gimmick, i want it to b single player but you pick from a list of established RE characters to go through the story with like RE1

[0:47:08] <+MisterCrimson> @FirearmsInstructor on the podcast Pat mentioned that he was invited to play a D&D session. During it, Pat wasn't feeling it, so he went off on his own and ended up killing a story central NPC. He couldn't make it to the next session and the DM got pissy because Pat "ruinued" his entire campaign by not being there.

[1:43:44] <+Cityscape17> RE becky
[1:43:45] <+PanicSwytch> Gooo
[1:43:45] <%Teintstein> those monkeys look very Congo inspired
[1:43:46] <cureneckbeard> Does anybody in Resident Evil other than this one ever get canonically hit by a zombie and survives?
[1:43:47] <%Ranryu692> duh, it's a basement
[1:43:48] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Remember DA LOCKER, Pat.
[1:43:49] <%Darren716> Your basement sucks
[1:43:50] <%spongeofmystery> Fucking spiders
[1:43:51] <+OwlLightningMage> Where are the zombie elephants?
[1:43:53] <%StaceMcGate> Wasn't Pat killed by a jobber zombie last time?
[1:43:54] <+Th3SmartAlec> Only needs some clown farts
[1:43:54] <%JJCheeker> Elmo needs to replenish da goo
[1:43:55] <$QueequegTheater> @AngriestPat Pat it's pretty ironic considering a certain ongoing LP that Billy was coerced into big war crimes
[1:43:55] <%goose_attack_almanac> That basement could use some RAID: shadow legends
[1:44:07] <%Laecerelius> BEKEH STRONK
[1:44:07] <trashcansan> his goo will never be gooshed BibleThump
[1:44:09] <+MisterCrimson> No shit, that made me think you were playing parasite eve
[1:44:10] <%natebud> I wish every enemy was an eliminator
[1:44:10] <Zaphire_Saucypants> @StaceMcGate Ye, he was.
[1:44:11] <%Mindtrick_Matt> You could always shoot things and make it suck less
[1:44:22] <NoHoldsBarredProductions> BECKScellent work
[1:44:22] <+Pookiedaexzile> Maid: Shallow Peasants
[1:44:26] <Fujiwara_92> @angriestpat did you see the bullshit that a Russian dude is trying too pull with the SCP
[1:44:28] <%Laecerelius> Oops! All eliminators!
[1:44:30] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Brought to you by RAID SHADOW LEGENDS
[1:44:33] <nademonkey1100> ohhh fuck did pat take the money
[1:44:36] <%grandark_z317> no, not Rayeed Shoggoth Leg Ends!
[1:44:38] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat I disagree.
[1:44:39] <+PlagueOfGripes> This Billy is brought to you by Squarespace
[1:44:39] <%SirGO0SE> becky becky shes our babe, if she cant do it billy
[1:44:42] <%Dragon_Batman> I mean yes and yes
[1:44:43] <$QueequegTheater> @Fujiwara_92 That's been ongoing for years
[1:44:43] <Zaphire_Saucypants> .......yes.
[1:44:46] <%JJCheeker> This game needs more bug enemies
[1:44:49] <%Aydarkzero> gotta conserve the ammo
[1:44:52] <+MisterCrimson> gotta save ammo in case you need it later
[1:44:54] <%natebud> Pat hasn't learned the shoot technique yet
[1:44:55] <%trueherobappo> LOOK AT ALL THOSE GUNS THOUGH
[1:44:59] <trashcansan> what if he needs it later
[1:45:01] <Fujiwara_92> @queequegtheater it really hasnt
[1:45:03] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat Would you talk about goo and used children in your Raid: Shadowlands sponsorship?
[1:45:04] <lloyddboy> FIGHT EM PAT
[1:45:04] <%Darren716> Yo can i just say Becky is a top tier name? It's got 3 great variations, Rebekah, Becky, and Bex
[1:45:04] <majima666> man, i just remembered the big dumb bat boss
[1:45:05] <Vohs_Bru> I usually just shoot at my house to make it better
[1:45:06] <%Tracazoid> If you get to the final boss without at least 100 pistol rounds, then it's fission mailed.
[1:45:08] <%Laecerelius> THOSE GUNS ARE USELESS!
[1:45:09] <lloyddboy> FIGHT THE MIND GOBOLINS
[1:45:10] <BoneofMalkav> Shooting enemies? In a Resident Evil game? Are you mad?! LUL
[1:45:10] <majima666> FUCK that big dumb bat boss
[1:45:12] <%Solidnick18> but i wanna use it now
[1:45:12] <majindusto> YOU ARE THE INSANE ONE
[1:45:13] <+razielhex> could we use that Mp5? nah, gonna stay with this 9m
[1:45:15] <Fujiwara_92> it's new bullshit
[1:45:16] <%Maids4lyfe> he's right
[1:45:18] <%Teintstein> creative use of game mechanics
[1:45:19] <+jorgamund> Can confirm. I am an ammo, and that's how it works.
[1:45:23] <+razielhex> is that a TAR-21? Nah, gonna stick with it
[1:45:23] <ape_hawk> shove the ammo up the butthole for safe keeping
[1:45:26] <s1rcuit> Crazy Talk's on full steam today
[1:45:26] <%GarbageQueenEllie> You need at least 2000 rounds of each ammo to get the True Ending
[1:45:26] <FirearmsInstructor> 385
[1:45:26] <+OhioNitsud> fuck Veronica. It's all about the BillyBecky
[1:45:27] <%JJCheeker> 666
[1:45:28] <trashcansan> I agree
[1:45:29] <+Pookiedaexzile> Toy must fill your self with the metal goo
[1:45:29] <DisGuyOvahEre> pat why are perma death games so bad
[1:45:33] <%Monkeyweed21> Have you ever ACTUALLY run out of ammo in a Resident Evil game? @AngriestPat
[1:45:37] <+OwlLightningMage> Sans judges you on how much ammo you have
[1:45:40] <%Laecerelius> BEKEH SMURT!
[1:45:41] <%spongeofmystery> @razielhex to be fair an MP5 does shoot 9mm rounds
[1:45:42] <%EndlessScrapper> apatCrazyhand apatCrazyhead
[1:45:43] <$QueequegTheater> @Fujiwara_92 It very literally has. This same thing happened in 2018
[1:45:46] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> That's completely correct, my mind goblins are the same way/
[1:46:02] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Good Job Billeh
[1:46:03] <%StaceMcGate> We are so damn close to RE4...
[1:46:04] <%Mindtrick_Matt> But what about the limited healing you also have Pat?
[1:46:05] <+Pookiedaexzile> Better hand gun for shoot
[1:46:06] <+razielhex> There a FAMAS back there? Nah, that's fine.
[1:46:06] <%natebud> Rebillabeca
[1:46:07] <%JJCheeker> Billy shuuut
[1:46:09] <%Rumbutt> Cave Middleman Pat needs his Fire Royalties
[1:46:10] <arkv01> billy needs the handguns to enter his goo trance
[1:46:10] <%tiaramaki> Here's to hoping you get out of that room better than last time
[1:46:12] <+Pookiedaexzile> Forshooot goooooooooooooo
[1:46:21] <FirearmsInstructor> Billy doesn't have enough space
[1:46:24] <+Th3SmartAlec> PogChamp
[1:46:25] <+OwlLightningMage> There's nothing going on in this game, so Pat makes up for it by saying names over and over again LUL
[1:46:25] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Use their Force Telepathy bond
[1:46:29] <$QueequegTheater> Russian assholes have been trying to blackmail and scam the SCP website into giving them a big payout for a while
[1:46:32] <Fujiwara_92> @queequegtheater since when 2018, is ye-- FUCK WE ARE IN 2020, IT ACTUALLY HAS BEEN MORE THAN A YEAR
[1:46:32] <+PlagueOfGripes> Who would win in a fight, Billy or Ethan
[1:46:32] <+OhioNitsud> for Billy magnum dong
[1:46:33] <trulythedude> didn't you do this already
[1:46:35] <majima666> famas is one of my favourite guns....probably cause im a huge metal gear nerd though lol

[1:46:54] <+OwlLightningMage> Joe Baker
[1:46:54] <%TwinBat> Billy
[1:46:54] <%cr0wdcontrol> Ashley
[1:46:54] <$QueequegTheater> Ethan has precious antique coins
[1:46:55] <FirearmsInstructor> Oh RE7?
[1:46:55] <%Solidnick18> billethan
[1:46:57] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @PlagueOfGripes Ethan from Heavy Rain
[1:46:57] <%Laecerelius> Billeh has a lack of war crimes on his side!
[1:46:58] <%theotherkristian> Ethan
[1:46:59] <+Th3SmartAlec> Billy
[1:46:59] <ape_hawk> ethan never committed not-war crimes
[1:47:01] <Zaphire_Saucypants> yeah, Ethan
[1:47:01] <%tigerfang86> Ethan has like SUPERPOWERS
[1:47:02] <+MisterCrimson> Well, Ethan has weird regeneration powers from the mold, so yeah
[1:47:03] <tanarath> E-tahn
[1:47:06] <Fujiwara_92> yeah, Ethan can kick some ass
[1:47:06] <%Sir_stride> got his arm and foot chopped off
[1:47:07] <rytisone> Joe Baker
[1:47:07] <@commanderclaw> Ethan can regen from Green Herbs
[1:47:07] <Meekest> Yeah and now he's gonna be a werewolf
[1:47:08] <%theotherkristian> Ethan lost two limbs in one day
[1:47:09] <arkv01> ethan probably has a virus?
[1:47:10] <%Aydarkzero> Ethan is pretty fucking resilient
[1:47:13] <%tigerfang86> yeah hes got mold shit powers
[1:47:13] <FirearmsInstructor> Does Ethan have goop-juice?
[1:47:13] <DatAsuna> Ethan took a lot of canonical hits
[1:47:13] <+OwlLightningMage> Joe Baker would beat both of their asses
[1:47:14] <ZeeJiggle> Dude lost multiple limbs
[1:47:15] <%Zerodyne90> Also forgot his name..
[1:47:15] <%natebud> Ethan had a steady supply of goo to reattach his limbs with
[1:47:16] <%Sir_stride> a knife in the palm
[1:47:17] <%Hiro01231> he had magic healing goo
[1:47:18] <%Tracazoid> To be fair Ethan had turbo healing in compensate.
[1:47:22] <corepercentlives> Ethan is infected and tolerant
[1:47:23] <%Delenay> healing juice
[1:47:23] <OswaldTheDog> real question: who’s name is easier to shout - billy or shaun
[1:47:24] <%WackyXmand> @AngriestPat tell Paige I'm eating bagels and there delicious.
[1:47:25] <DatAsuna> but ethan only made it cuz healing juice
[1:47:25] <morcego_cinzento_arts> That handgun scooper doesn't even compare to the STI eagle(which is a real competition gun btw) in RE3
[1:47:28] <$QueequegTheater> @AngriestPat Am I the only one who feels like Ethan is the John McClane of RE
[1:47:29] <majindusto> God, it is so Infuriating listening to Pat's bullshit babbling
[1:47:30] <%Solidnick18> ethan just uses goo and he's fine
[1:47:32] <%paisleyopossum> do we even know what ethan looks like
[1:47:32] <+PlagueOfGripes> Ethan took a lot of damage because he knew he had to reach his Goo Deposit
[1:47:34] <trashcansan> nah ethan only lived due to the weird pouring juice
[1:47:37] <nademonkey1100> who would win billy or that old guy from 7 dlc
[1:47:41] <%PrettyThickandStrongDyck> He was low-key infected
[1:47:41] <%TwinBat> ETHEY
[1:47:41] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Ethy
[1:47:42] <%Order_of_Mystery> Ethan. he got a hand and leg cut off and still whooped ass
[1:47:42] <ape_hawk> ETHY
[1:47:44] <%Faustgesicht> Ethan's a reporter (?), Billy is a Marine.
[1:47:45] <+razielhex> Time for BATTLE
[1:47:46] <%GarbageQueenEllie> He's stronger 'cause he gotta GOO his GIRL
[1:47:46] <ZeeJiggle> Etun
[1:47:48] <%Tracazoid> Ethel
[1:47:48] <+Th3SmartAlec> Ethan "Billy" Winters
[1:47:49] <Zaphire_Saucypants> get fucked Pat
[1:47:49] <%Teintstein> RESET
[1:47:50] <%natebud> Billy can't make healing items so he'd lose.
[1:47:50] <%tigerfang86> DED
[1:47:51] <+OwlLightningMage> Ethan had paint powers
[1:47:51] <%StaceMcGate> DEAD
[1:47:51] <%Aydarkzero> god that would have been awful
[1:47:52] <%peachy996> Chrissy Redfielfd
[1:47:53] <%Faustgesicht> Money's on billy
[1:47:53] <arkv01> uh superspies can re-attach limbs?
[1:47:58] <+chunkymonkey737> is it possible for chris to lose at arm wrestling even if he doesn't try?
[1:47:58] <arkv01> dude definitely has some kinda supervirus
[1:47:58] <Admiral_PopnFresh> I mean, that's not De-confirmed at all
[1:48:04] <%godzookylives> Why are Hunters in this game?
[1:48:06] <morcego_cinzento_arts> Also i just had a bran fart, cause i confused Ethan with Piers from RE6 and was like "wait that guy didn't survived in RE6"
[1:48:07] <%Aydarkzero> i like the idea of just some dude going through Resident Evil
[1:48:07] <+kikanshat0masu> Glad to see pat having fun this playthrough
[1:48:07] <%Sir_stride> NO DELAY THIS TIME
[1:48:11] <%solidousstream> that's the reveal in RE 8
[1:48:14] <ape_hawk> why does billeh look like Ignis but way less cooler?
[1:48:17] <%trekkie11041> @AngriestPat wasnt it because he was infected with the mold
[1:48:17] <%Rumbutt> The star wars noises
[1:48:18] <%theotherkristian> I saw a RUMOR saying he's protagonist for RE8
[1:48:18] <trashcansan> @arkv01 when they have that green juice apparently yes?
[1:48:19] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Ethan got infected with the mold right before dinner. Thats why he could regen limbs and have hallucinations AKA young kid Evie
[1:48:20] <Zaphire_Saucypants> nice, Pt
[1:48:21] <%Aydarkzero> @godzookylives don't worry about it
[1:48:22] <Roz_Lynd> aren't they called "lickers" or some shit?
[1:48:24] <+OwlLightningMage> You gain the ability to regrow limbs when you become a spy in real life
[1:48:25] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Ah, a salt gun. Quite effective against giant slugs
[1:48:34] <$QueequegTheater> @AngriestPat Nah, he's just an average guy who finds out he's far stronger than he thought he was, that's why it works—he's anime John McClane
[1:48:35] <%maskofmichael> Not Roger, Billy
[1:48:36] <+AlastorSlain> DAS NOTT ROGER THAT BILLEH
[1:48:36] <%Sadira_snack_attack> Quick...carve them for their precious parts

[1:49:02] <%Solidnick18> beckey
[1:49:02] <corepercentlives> maybe "Ethan" is someone we know hence no face reveal
[1:49:05] <%Faustgesicht> Sorry, Ethan is a Systems Analyst
[1:49:06] <Admiral_PopnFresh> BILLY GO NOW GOOD
[1:49:08] <%natebud> of course, harkness test
[1:49:09] <+jorgamund> or maybe the T-virus just makes you super weak so none of the attacks actually work
[1:49:09] <%SirGO0SE> billymon

[1:49:10] <%StaceMcGate> Becky use pick up

[1:49:37] <%draugrix> Billy use acid round
[1:49:37] <%Faustgesicht> BILLEE is a fighting type
[1:49:46] <morcego_cinzento_arts> I forgot that there were spiders in RE0
[1:49:49] <%Rumbutt> Fuck yeah, I am looking forward to the DS9 streams
[1:49:49] <Zaphire_Saucypants> you and everyone else Pat
[1:49:51] <ape_hawk> why is billy shooting zombies with cum?

[1:49:55] <TalisKanju> Pat loves the monkeys
[1:49:57] <+razielhex> hahaha
[1:49:58] <SiGBlitz> @Pookiedaexzile did you fuck up saying boys or guys?
[1:50:00] <%natebud> Look at that routine they're putting on!
[1:50:00] <$QueequegTheater> Oh my god I just noticed how awful that inventory UI is, CHrist
[1:50:02] <rcand9> funny monkey
[1:50:06] <rytisone> Munkey Bad
[1:50:07] <+PlagueOfGripes> Time to put Billy and Becky into the breeding camp to roll for new Becky IVs
[1:50:08] <%godzookylives> thats like a mini nuke
[1:50:09] <%spongeofmystery> Anyone else's music getting pitch shifted?
[1:50:12] <Admiral_PopnFresh> kunoREE
[1:50:14] <Zaphire_Saucypants> they aint runnin at you
[1:50:15] <%peachy996> Billy's Pain noise always tickles me
[1:50:15] <FirearmsInstructor> gottem
[1:50:15] <Zaphire_Saucypants> so ye
[1:50:20] <%natebud> Who knew killing things was this effective
[1:50:21] <trulythedude> that was the death noise yeah genius
[1:50:22] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @trashcansan Yea ik. Im just saying regen limbs for simplicity's sake. But he technically could regen a limb completely since he is infected most of the game
[1:50:23] <+Pookiedaexzile> @SiGBlitz I'll never telll.....
[1:50:23] <Vitoria90> does the grenade launcher in this game hold infinite rounds like in REmake 1 or is it limited to a more realistic 6?
[1:50:27] <%StaceMcGate> Billy is a TemTem
[1:50:31] <+razielhex> you could try shooting your 120 rounds of pistol ammo at them
[1:50:32] <trashcansan> when is pat gonna do asmr streams
[1:50:35] <Fujiwara_92> I need an Adamant Billy, can someone trade with me
[1:50:36] <+schlager087> @PlagueOfGripes in here leaking the script for his next video
[1:50:38] <+White_n0ize> So is Ethan actually the toughest in the cast? Cuz he gets back up a lot
[1:50:45] <$QueequegTheater> @AngriestPat Billy is a Pokemon, Ethan is a TemTem
[1:50:45] <%Rumbutt> @spongeofmystery Happens sometimes, usually pausing (not reloading) and un pausing the stream works for me
[1:50:47] <Zaphire_Saucypants> @Vitoria90 It runs past 6
[1:50:50] <+OwlLightningMage> Joe Baker is the strongest
[1:50:52] <Vitoria90> nice
[1:50:53] <arkv01> becky, its time for GOO
[1:50:53] <%SirGO0SE> shiny becky
[1:50:53] <%Faustgesicht> So is this Billee shiny?
[1:50:55] <%StaceMcGate> Ethan didn't punch a boulder
[1:50:58] <TalisKanju> @PlagueOfGripes Pat would be playing this game forever if this was like Pokémon
[1:51:00] <$QueequegTheater> @White_n0ize Ethan is the tank, Leon and Chris are DPS, Becky is the healer
[1:51:01] <Zaphire_Saucypants> @Vitoria90 Holds, I mean.
[1:51:03] <mesamus> @PlagueOfGripes plague i was on a binge read of the MHA manga, when's the buff bunny woman art NotLikeThis
[1:51:06] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @razielhex He might need that ammo for later though
[1:51:13] <+chunkymonkey737> billy doesn't order a billy club when he goes to jimmy john's because he's too cool for that shit
[1:51:14] <%theotherkristian> Despite how boring it was, 6 had fun rolling
[1:51:15] <%natebud> @White_n0ize Easily.
[1:51:16] <%XeroSigmaPrime> I definitely want to see more of Ethan. He's an average dude who forces himself through hell
[1:51:17] <Themostdelicious> Wesker is a literal superhuman though.
[1:51:18] <+OwlLightningMage> Joe Baker would punch Nemesis to death
[1:51:20] <majima666> becky knows how to make the dankest of herbs
[1:51:23] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Pat, you sound vaguely like Tim Curry narrating this. And now I want a Tim Curry Resident Evil Audiobook so bad
[1:51:25] <%spongeofmystery> @Rumbutt much obliged, that seems to have fixed it
[1:51:35] <Fujiwara_92> Wesker is just Mewtwo
[1:51:37] <Virgil_Valentine> The grim adventures of Billy and ma- uh Becky
[1:51:42] <trashcansan> JOE BAKER FOR RE 8 PROTAG
[1:51:43] <%Rumbutt> @spongeofmystery No prob enbGood
[1:51:44] <%natebud> I never want to see Ethan again because he was so good in RE7
[1:51:44] <Vohs_Bru> Wesker is superdead, not in this game tough
[1:51:47] <+PlagueOfGripes> Becklee
[1:51:50] <Vitoria90> The only fear I have of any RE sequel is that they bring back Wesker
[1:51:53] <%Faustgesicht> If anyone NEEDS to come back, It's Joe Baker.
[1:51:55] <mesamus> beckei
[1:51:56] <Vitoria90> Like I want Wesker to stay derad
[1:52:01] <+razielhex> @trashcansan played by Joe Don Baker, from MITCHEL
[1:52:02] <+OwlLightningMage> Wesker is just everything. Wesker is whatever the plot needs him to be
[1:52:03] <$boomboxvillain> This is the good Resident Evil game right?
[1:52:03] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @Admiral_PopnFresh Tim Curry should voice an RE villain
[1:52:10] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Yes, we need more Joe Baker
[1:52:10] <Vitoria90> This is an ok RE game
[1:52:10] <majima666> this was one of my main complaints about zero. this place is too similar to the mansion
[1:52:11] <%StaceMcGate> Brad Vickers should return in RE8
[1:52:13] <Vitoria90> It's got issues
[1:52:14] <%natebud> Relative Evil
[1:52:14] <+chunkymonkey737> @Vitoria90 complete global weskeration
[1:52:15] <%theotherkristian> it's om
[1:52:20] <Admiral_PopnFresh> @morcego_cinzento_arts agreed
[1:52:24] <Ipsenscastle> That's weird, I didn't get an email to say you'd gone live???
[1:52:30] <TalisKanju> If anyone needs to come back, it should be that guy Claire gave the lighter to in CVX
[1:52:31] <Virgil_Valentine> It’s an okay game at best
[1:52:34] <%Faustgesicht> IMPORTANT QUESTION: Joe Baker or Hunk?
[1:52:34] <Vitoria90> Complete Global Lactation
[1:52:36] <Ipsenscastle> !uptime

[1:52:53] <%XeroSigmaPrime> HUNK > Joe
[1:52:55] <%Sir_stride> who ever thought that removing the item box should've been fired
[1:52:55] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I saw da bottle

[1:53:12] <Fujiwara_92> nah, Becky's legal
[1:53:13] <%JJCheeker> if only there was some kind of item box.....
[1:53:13] <+OwlLightningMage> Rebecca is actually a 100 year old Chinese myth dragon
[1:53:15] <TalisKanju> Becca is a genus
[1:53:20] <TalisKanju> and a genius
[1:53:22] <Roz_Lynd> i bet she's 17 in the japanese version
[1:53:24] <rcand9> so worth it
[1:53:24] <Zaphire_Saucypants> it's a fucked series of hallways
[1:53:31] <%spongeofmystery> TAKE MOLOTOVS PLZ
[1:53:32] <%SirGO0SE> Yep Becky is a Tiki
[1:53:34] <Zaphire_Saucypants> you will need molotovs
[1:53:34] <Vohs_Bru> Rebecca is the protagonist of the Tommyknockers, that is why we never see her again
[1:53:34] <morcego_cinzento_arts> Rebecca is 18 here. And will forever be an 18 even in Vendetta
[1:53:54] <%natebud> six eliminators?
[1:53:57] <cogblocker55> hey spoiler alert zero sucks
[1:53:59] <Fujiwara_92> it's her power and curse

[1:55:17] <%natebud> But what if you need them later?
[1:55:27] <%XeroSigmaPrime> What if we play as Chris' son in RE8, setting out to kill his cousin, Josh Kennedy
[1:55:34] <thunderborn32> @AngriestPat Temtem advice for pat, 1. the rock climbing gear isn't in the game yet 2. taterz cant evolve 3. level an electric type if you dont want to get soft locked by the first gym i mean 'dojo'
[1:55:38] <+BionoidLCR> @Virgil_Valentine nah grown sherry would be dope instead of her being in a shit tier game like re6

[2:08:54] <morcego_cinzento_arts> Just make sure you don't have specific types of plants, like smol tomatos plants. Cause some leafs are downright toxic to cats...and since cats love to chew leafs(helps to vomit) that can be a fucking problem
[2:08:54] <%SirGO0SE> doot doot incoming

[2:17:15] <%Sausious> *GASP* YOU'RE CHEATING
[2:17:18] <+PanicSwytch> ANIMAL STATUE
[2:17:21] <%SirGO0SE> It's fucking astonishing Resident Evil was a successful franchise. Most of the series is mediocre or terrible. Out of the entire series 1/2/3/4/REmake/RER2 are classics. 5/7/Revelations 2 are really good. Revelations and the Outbreaks are cool. The rest are middling to trash.
[2:17:23] <TechDragon_Z> I remember forgetting the one that's like got in this iron press thingy.
[2:17:24] <%EndlessScrapper> "Im going to trick my special forces team into fighting my ultimate bioweapon! Even though a bunch of dogs killed like half the team and only 4 members were left alive to actually fight it." -The logic of RE series main antagonist

[2:17:53] <%dheng1> Cheater Cheater pumpkin eater
[2:17:56] <SMuffinMan> Veronica and Zero are way worse than the Rev games. Pat is big right about all of it. Except the Chronicles games, those are fun
[2:17:57] <FirearmsInstructor> @spongeofmystery ? wut
[2:18:00] <rcand9> pat leech hunter?
[2:18:07] <%Monkeyweed21> Pat needs a Re:Minder

[2:18:56] <Vohs_Bru> and thats it
[2:18:56] <ElenaManetta> 4:3 streams are kind of cozy. Pat's face isn't 10 pixels wide
[2:18:57] <Ipsenscastle> is he though
[2:19:00] <%dheng1> Why did they take out the item box ?
[2:19:01] <%natebud> 6 easily gets much more boring and is much longer.
[2:19:01] <Zaphire_Saucypants> and then there's Wesker Mode
[2:19:02] <%Tearonex> Zero is just boring
[2:19:03] <%Sir_stride> but what about CVX?
[2:19:10] <%Monkeyweed21> Billy and Becky are WAY BETTER than Steve and the Incest kids
[2:19:11] <daemos123> 6 is just a big dumb shooter
[2:19:11] <+Taglog7> and hats
[2:19:15] <%SirGO0SE> 0 isnt as bad as you make it out to be tbh. and if you remember, when it came out, it was very well received iirc

[2:19:30] <%Delenay> but not your body
[2:19:31] <Vitoria90> Depends on the game

[2:33:02] <majima666> replace billy with steve
[2:33:02] <Fujiwara_92> like, idk a box
[2:33:03] <rcand9> yup
[2:33:06] <FirearmsInstructor> @Aydarkzero LUL +1
[2:33:07] <%Teintstein> it'd still be boring though
[2:33:08] <Vohs_Bru> put double itemboyes
[2:33:10] <%silverira> Atache Room HD
[2:33:13] <Vohs_Bru> boxes
[2:33:14] <rcand9> game would be decent
[2:33:15] <tanarath> A box, for items?!?
[2:33:17] <%ha2ken> No. You need a item dumpster. @AngriestPat
[2:33:19] <@commanderclaw> I feel like contrarians designed this game
[2:33:20] <%Solidnick18> just make it better
[2:33:20] <+freeizone> also nerfing slapping zombie
[2:33:21] <FirearmsInstructor> @Teintstein shut up, tho
[2:33:22] <tanarath> Pat
[2:33:32] <%natebud> No magic elevator
[2:33:32] <%TinyLittleDancer> Magic boxes with shared inventories or just separate boxes?
[2:33:34] <%Aydarkzero> @FirearmsInstructor LUL
[2:33:37] <%lionandfox21> Basically when in doubt, item bo
[2:33:38] <%GalacticaPhanto> @angriestpat what's a good build for a beginner pyromancer in DS1?
[2:33:42] <%lionandfox21> *box
[2:33:43] <Vohs_Bru> put itemboxes on enemies basically Mimics
[2:33:45] <%michingmallecho> A box...for ítems? How novel apatSmug
[2:33:46] <rcand9> id replay this loads with item boxes
[2:33:48] <%maskofmichael> Is there an Item Box mod?
[2:33:50] <tanarath> Pat, come on, that'll never take off .
[2:33:55] <$QueequegTheater> @GalacticaPhanto Reinforced club
[2:33:57] <%SirGO0SE> cvx might be unsalvageable
[2:33:59] <%natebud> CVX was never playtested
[2:34:01] <Ipsenscastle> Starship Titanic had the best Item boxes, they were robot monkeys with trumpets for faces called Succ-U-Buses
[2:34:02] <rytisone> or playtested and ignored
[2:34:04] <+DiabloDeAzul> well I'd rather have interesting enemies rather than item boxes, since the whole point of RE0 is that it's logistical
[2:34:13] <%Maids4lyfe> remember when CV was supposed to be 3
[2:34:14] <%Aydarkzero> it's a game i guess
[2:34:14] <tealwolf26> What's a playtest? You guys do that? cmonBruh
[2:34:16] <daemos123> this is still better cvx
[2:34:17] <TalisKanju> I believe CVX was, OG Code Veronica probably wasn't though
[2:34:18] <+Tyonidus> henlo patrick
[2:34:19] <+freeizone> playtested with godmode
[2:34:21] <%Intersceptre> I just caught up on the Pat-Art thing and he's my twin. Doing something correct isn't special, and what Pat does in choosing skins/doing games is just correct.
[2:34:22] <rcand9> cvx is boring for different reasons
[2:34:26] <trashcansan> what's a playtest
[2:34:26] <$QueequegTheater> @GalacticaPhanto Also you're asking Pat for a good build as if he actually knows how Souls stats work. LUL
[2:34:28] <%lionandfox21> Does make one wonder if the current dev teams for the REmakes going on have been thinking about remaking CVX and RE0
[2:34:35] <%natebud> Everyone asking for a CVX remake forgets that there's nothing to salvage from that game.
[2:34:40] <daemos123> this game is just kind of boring
[2:34:41] <%Tyonidus> love u pat
[2:34:45] <+RayDaug> Oh my god I just realized that this game is basically de facto Real Survivor mode
[2:34:46] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat The loopback on the fucking sub part is FUCKING NUTS in CVX
[2:34:50] <daemos123> but cvx starts out decent and then turns into literal shit
[2:34:51] <Dova573> I remember Max hating this too
[2:34:52] <%TinyLittleDancer> I can see why they did it, item boxes are an antiquated game contrivance ... It's a crutch that nostalgia is giving you rose colored glasses of
[2:34:54] <%luftraumm1> also memory limits of the system
[2:34:54] <+OwlLightningMage> CVX has a giant Clair ass. It's better by default
[2:34:57] <tealwolf26> Or Bethesda that leaves live active devkit tools open for players to use in a multiplayer game. Kappa
[2:35:03] <TalisKanju> There is plenty to salvage from CVS
[2:35:03] <%Aydarkzero> @natebud that's why i hope they go right to re8 after r3make
[2:35:10] <majima666> code veronica at least has a super dumb and stupid story
[2:35:10] <Ipsenscastle> I imagine a lot of people just straight-up lost key items
[2:35:14] <TalisKanju> And plenty to salvage from CVX too
[2:35:16] <Captain_Joe1911> Elmo not looking at us notekFeels
[2:35:23] <+SpoonlessAlakazam> Wouldn't the point of a remake of CV or 0 be to make it into a good game
[2:35:23] <majima666> zero is just boring for the most part storywise
[2:35:24] <rcand9> yup
[2:35:25] <+freeizone> game design by listening to players
[2:35:27] <%SirGO0SE> @owllightningmage omg Becky...look at her butt
[2:35:32] <Zaphire_Saucypants> until you unlock that Elevator
[2:35:33] <+AcidBrandon> Yeah, my first playthrough of RE0 was a nightmare and NOT a good nightmare!
[2:35:34] <TungstenViper> are you guys really saying that Code Veronica did nothing good?
[2:35:35] <rcand9> big chore
[2:35:36] <+Tr1pkT12> @AngriestPat RE or Silent Hill?
[2:35:40] <trashcansan> @tealwolf26 I still don't understand why they just don't have a test server for new updates
[2:35:41] <%Roasted_Pheasant> What a mansion!
[2:35:41] <Zaphire_Saucypants> but that's so far into the game, why even bother?
[2:35:46] <tealwolf26> Elmo is bored by strem! danCry
[2:35:48] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Did you get everything in the lecture hall room, too?
[2:35:48] <@commanderclaw> Gee, being a porter. How entertaining
[2:35:49] <+ar4ndomblackguy> i joined about 30 mins ago and ive seen nothing but item dumping and scooping....10/10
[2:35:51] <rcand9> but big bat
[2:35:54] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat with the projector
[2:35:54] <+chunkymonkey737> dropping items on the floor makes players WISH you could do that in RE1, but it would probably break the game if you could
[2:35:55] <Captain_Joe1911> Elmo staring at the wall notekFeels
[2:35:56] <daemos123> the only good part of cxv is alfred and wesker
[2:35:56] <%lionandfox21> @Ipsenscastle most definitely, I knew peopl e who never finished the game because of lost items
[2:36:02] <+OwlLightningMage> It's really hard to say which game is worse LUL
[2:36:04] <MachineHead9> for real?
[2:36:05] <%WackyXmand> Im back, he finished?
[2:36:06] <Ipsenscastle> @lionandfox21 ouch
[2:36:07] <+BisoromiBear> world record pace
[2:36:07] <%luftraumm1> did cvx do anything at least interesting?
[2:36:08] <+SpoonlessAlakazam> A third through the whole game?
[2:36:13] <%BigCoffee> I,d still say CV is thre worst one
[2:36:13] <trashcansan> @wackyxmand no
[2:36:15] <%natebud> nice
[2:36:17] <Vohs_Bru> meet me halfway...
[2:36:18] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Sorry looked away, just making sure. Good job.
[2:36:18] <Zaphire_Saucypants> a third sounds aboutish right? I mean, it depends on how fast you get through the lab? I dunno.
[2:36:18] <Nina96> @AngriestPat y r the bad re games so long?
[2:36:21] <+SpoonlessAlakazam> LUL
[2:36:21] <%SirGO0SE> cvx is definitely worse
[2:36:23] <rcand9> @luftraumm1 yes alfred
[2:36:26] <TalisKanju> I'll take CVX over 0, and 0 over 6
[2:36:29] <tealwolf26> @trashcansan I know right?
[2:36:30] <%spongeofmystery> Dump in outside corridor where the observatory drops to as well
[2:36:31] <+PanicSwytch> Bat is half way
[2:36:37] <%natebud> CVX is aggresively bad.
[2:36:38] <%luftraumm1> 6 Issa more brazen
[2:36:42] <bomfiz> I remember this being my second resident evil game. the first being RE4
[2:36:44] <+Cityscape17> so what you are saying pat, is that half is gameplay and the other half is item dumping?
[2:36:46] <%Dragovus> Y'all getting ready for BAT BOSS?
[2:36:46] <TungstenViper> is this bad Taste hour in chat?
[2:36:48] <Zaphire_Saucypants> definitely don't forget those flame rounds.
[2:36:48] <%takiyami> good point, which is better, this or CV?
[2:36:49] <cesare92x> hey there Pat
[2:36:49] <+AcidBrandon> Getting close to the worst boss in all of Resident Evil
[2:36:52] <idfk_panda> is 6 that bad lol
[2:36:56] <%Sir_stride> 6 is just boring. CVX and this are just bad.
[2:36:57] <+razielhex> "I'm not even halfway, maybe a third." 60 seconds. "Probably halfway at this door"
[2:36:58] <$QueequegTheater> @Cityscape17 That IS the gameplay
[2:36:58] <TalisKanju> GET THE BAT
[2:36:58] <rcand9> big bat
[2:36:59] <daemos123> 6 is a generic shooter
[2:37:01] <Fujiwara_92> nah, it's 0 > 6 > CVX
[2:37:06] <Vohs_Bru> oh no Bats
[2:37:07] <rcand9> bat but big
[2:37:08] <$Blackgaver> billy is so smart
[2:37:09] <daemos123> its okay but its not a re game at all
[2:37:13] <%SirGO0SE> i never played 6 but have been told sections of it are great
[2:37:15] <roofkie> dats a really fat kitty
[2:37:23] <%stevesekai> I've said it before and I'll say it again: Billy for RE8
[2:37:24] <%Shadowpint> I somehow did not remember this part at all
[2:37:25] <Fujiwara_92> Corona virus bats monkaS
[2:37:25] <%Aydarkzero> oh...
[2:37:26] <Vitoria90> okay what's the actual worst RE game, counting every game
[2:37:27] <TalisKanju> CVX is at least funny in addition to stupid
[2:37:28] <cesare92x> Hey there Pat

[2:37:35] <tealwolf26> CrreamAwk WutFace
[2:37:36] <daemos123> 6 is an action set piece game like uncharted

[2:37:38] <+FrenchTact1cs> 6 might be the best of the shit ones
[2:37:39] <TungstenViper> i've never seen more people being objectively wrong about a game such as this chat
[2:37:43] <%WackyXmand> Did they expect you to grab and go for items and not collect anything?

[2:38:39] <cesare92x> Hi there Pat
[2:38:40] <%SirGO0SE> i guess you could say you billiminated the billiminators
[2:38:43] <%tiaramaki> Thank you Capcom, very cool
[2:38:45] <Fujiwara_92> thanks for coming to Pat's Ted talk
[2:38:46] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> they're easy to run past
[2:38:46] <+OwlLightningMage> This game is so bad
[2:38:48] <%natebud> CVX is probably the worst balanced and paced game I've ever played.
[2:38:56] <TalisKanju> One of my problems with 6 is that the scenarios try to copy other games in the series without not knowing what made those games good.
[2:39:04] <%storkeylope> Very cool
[2:39:05] <%the_vedo_show> atpCap atpCap
[2:39:09] <SMuffinMan> Fuck Eliminators
[2:39:10] <rcand9> fight big bat
[2:39:12] <cesare92x> What do you like from RE6?
[2:39:12] <%luftraumm1> when the answer to a problem in a game is to avoid playing through it, that's poor game design
[2:39:15] <%spongeofmystery> PAT DID YOU GET THE CHEMICAL FOR THE STRIPPING AGENT
[2:39:17] <TungstenViper> @natebud why is it unbalanced?
[2:39:18] <TalisKanju> GET THE BAT
[2:39:20] <%MelBrooksKA> @Fujiwara_92 thanks, I hated it spyCappa
[2:39:25] <Zaphire_Saucypants> fuck this boss
[2:39:30] <Vohs_Bru> jenga is better than this
[2:39:33] <+SlappyMeats> is it just me or is Eliminators so much more powerful of a name than Hunters?
[2:39:34] <TomFrank> Resident Evil: Item Mover
[2:39:42] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat BTW any thoughts on how China is basically URL Umbrella, Inc?
[2:39:48] <FirearmsInstructor> *IRL
[2:39:51] <cesare92x> what do you like in RE6?
[2:39:58] <%spongeofmystery> Pew
[2:39:59] <trashcansan> I just realized this is basically just proto death stranding
[2:40:00] <%spongeofmystery> Phew
[2:40:05] <SMuffinMan> Yep, shame they suck, Slappy
[2:40:11] <+AcidBrandon> This game would be so much better WITHOUT the hookshot.
[2:40:12] <+SlappyMeats> for real
[2:40:14] <rcand9> i like that re 6 ends
[2:40:18] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @FirearmsInstructor I don't know what you're talking about. China is our most gracious overlord.
[2:40:20] <%Fdrank> I enjoyed the co op challenge mode in re6
[2:40:30] <Zaphire_Saucypants> there should be six more flame rounds in the church...so you should be good
[2:40:31] <%Fdrank> that's it though
[2:40:32] <FirearmsInstructor> @AcidBrandon but V1dy3hg43mz!!! D:<
[2:40:40] <ElenaManetta> Billy edit this part out
[2:40:42] <cesare92x> Pat what do you like in RE6?
[2:40:44] <FirearmsInstructor> @King_Wolf_Rigger China #1!!!!
[2:40:45] <rytisone> does Pat hate it?
[2:40:46] <%SirGO0SE> LUL
[2:40:46] <Fujiwara_92> but why
[2:40:50] <+Cityscape17> are there no mods to change it?
[2:40:57] <%asgard147> Do you hate it pat? limesThink
[2:40:57] <TomFrank> more slots? nah you get 6 deal with it nerd
[2:40:58] <%Jekado> would RE0 be better with Attache case?
[2:41:00] <Ipsenscastle> happiestpat
[2:41:00] <rcand9> billy keep ink
[2:41:00] <SMuffinMan> pndPotato
[2:41:03] <%Roasted_Pheasant> You may hate it, but do you debate it?
[2:41:03] <ShichiNoBushi> Getting a bit like AM here.
[2:41:04] <%natebud> @TungstenViper The game is easy 90% of the time and just randomly impossibly difficult at others. You can lose your best weapons if the main character switches at the wrong time. It's just awful design.
[2:41:05] <%Zerodyne90> apatFist
[2:41:07] <+SlappyMeats> RE6 has Chris and Piers playing on the playground and that is the one good thing in that game
[2:41:08] <FirearmsInstructor> @King_Wolf_Rigger #1 exporter of misery and death.... :| oh wait also domestically, too. Wooo
[2:41:12] <APB_Harleqyn> It is so wacky because they had a solution for this in the lockbox and introduced a problem...
[2:41:15] <%Owkono> this inventory system is hot garbage
[2:41:23] <cesare92x> Pat what do you like in RE6?
[2:41:28] <adjothetiger> @angriestpat i give you kudos for being able to deal with the inventory management it looks so annoying
[2:41:36] <Sapphire_Breeze> LUL
[2:41:38] <Fujiwara_92> oh no
[2:41:38] <Sapphire_Breeze> OH NO
[2:41:39] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Yeah stripping agent
[2:41:39] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @FirearmsInstructor But from where else will I get my slave-made cheap cellphones?
[2:41:39] <%EndlessScrapper> Has Becky radio in like at all? "No longer pursuing escape war criminal. Fighting monsters possibly released by the corporation that controls the town."
[2:41:41] <rcand9> oooooooooooooo
[2:41:43] <Captain_Joe1911> carciSmug ?

[2:41:57] <Sapphire_Breeze> it's fiiiine
[2:42:00] <Zaphire_Saucypants> you COMBINE
[2:42:01] <TalisKanju> What is better, the inventory in 6, or the inventory in this game?
[2:42:03] <Zaphire_Saucypants> later
[2:42:03] <tanarath> Pat forgot something .
[2:42:04] <rcand9> later i think
[2:42:05] <Zaphire_Saucypants> in lab
[2:42:05] <+OwlLightningMage> Billy's dick is stripping agent
[2:42:06] <Fujiwara_92> Ada is in RE2
[2:42:07] <%leinadtonu> WHERE'S THE ART?
[2:42:09] <%natebud> You have a note, need some chemicals @AngriestPat
[2:42:09] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat It's created by combining the Red Chemical and the Green Chemical together using Rebecca's Mixing Set
[2:42:10] <tusk102> @AngriestPat what would you do if billy was the re8 protag
[2:42:14] <Zaphire_Saucypants> yeah
[2:42:16] <%TheSphereHunter> I like your beta Rebecca costume
[2:42:16] <JoelFleran> duhnnanananana bat billy
[2:42:19] <%Dragovus> It's a mix of two chemicals
[2:42:19] <Vohs_Bru> isnt this game fun Pat?
[2:42:20] <Ipsenscastle> @OwlLightningMage zing
[2:42:23] <+AcidBrandon> It'd be in Becca's chem set
[2:42:27] <rcand9> hi suzi

[2:42:43] <SMuffinMan> Heyo Suzi
[2:42:43] <Fujiwara_92> Kazuma Billy and Beta Becca
[2:42:48] <rcand9> big bat
[2:42:49] <%TheSphereHunter> hello friends
[2:42:51] <TungstenViper> @natebud what? i recently replayed the game, and the game is not really difficult at all. Just the bosses are really tedious. The character switch is handled badly but you still recover the items once you return to claire iirc.
[2:42:52] <Sapphire_Breeze> corona virus boss doodWAT

[2:43:27] <daemos123> after using it the bat shows up
[2:43:28] <%peachy996> For some reason I think of RE3
[2:43:29] <+SlappyMeats> Why would you need a save point? :)
[2:43:30] <%EndlessScrapper> Better not choke. No pressure
[2:43:30] <Zaphire_Saucypants> with more flame rounds
[2:43:32] <TalisKanju> Save Room music is great in Code Veronica
[2:43:35] <%trueherobappo> Pat getting apatBig frustrated.
[2:43:37] <%TheSphereHunter> yea Send a character inside but once you get to that save point prepare for Boss
[2:43:37] <+AcidBrandon> You get one before the boss
[2:43:37] <+OwlLightningMage> Time to choke
[2:43:39] <%leinadtonu> a this art critique needs more art
[2:43:42] <+OwlLightningMage> OKAY

[2:44:22] <%SirGO0SE> ....bily
[2:44:23] <%natebud> @TungstenViper That's why I said 90%. When I played, because I gave Claire all the best weapons for her boss fight. I had no way to fight Hunters when i became Chris and had to give up the shotgun. This kind of thing should not happen
[2:44:25] <rcand9> billy use ink
[2:44:28] <+OwlLightningMage> TIME TO CHOKE

[2:47:30] <+AcidBrandon> Nah
[2:47:30] <cesare92x> Pat what do you like in RE6?
[2:47:31] <trashcansan> NO
[2:47:31] <+TDotGoat> naturally
[2:47:31] <Deadbulky> YOU DID BIG GOOD
[2:47:32] <+RowenCleric> just keep playing
[2:47:32] <sharpster78> do you really wanna do that again?
[2:47:34] <DracaenaLeaf> Was this Twilight Princess??
[2:47:35] <nademonkey1100> meh your choice
[2:47:35] <TungstenViper> @XeroSigmaPrime i'm 100% sure you wouldn't be able to kill every enemy with knife. just because you saw some speedrunner do it, doesn't mean you're able to. Also the fire extinguisher is simply a bonus thing. The character switch i agree with it being badly implemented
[2:47:36] <tealwolf26> Welll that was........fun?
[2:47:36] <Zaphire_Saucypants> you did fuckin great
[2:47:37] <+Cityscape17> just use first aid spray
[2:47:38] <sonicspark007> no
[2:47:38] <%TheSphereHunter> I got PTSD again
[2:47:38] <%spongeofmystery> I always use shotgun for this fight
[2:47:41] <rcand9> so many rounds
[2:47:44] <SGrim> @AngriestPat can you live with an imperfect run?
[2:47:48] <%SirGO0SE> if you do it again you WILL lose 4 times in a row and break
[2:47:48] <%Shadowpint> I thought the CVX bosses were bad but damn this reminded me RE0 has the worst boss
[2:47:52] <Fujiwara_92> shut up
[2:47:54] <%natebud> play tetris i hear that helps
[2:47:55] <+AugustHaze> Can you??
[2:47:58] <FirearmsInstructor> @TungstenViper wait fire extinguisher?
[2:47:58] <King_Wolf_Rigger> can you tho?
[2:47:59] <cesare92x> what do you like in RE6?
[2:48:01] <Fujiwara_92> SHUT UP
[2:48:02] <%Laecerelius> Fight the gobolins, Pat!
[2:48:03] <Deadbulky> Goblins defeated
[2:48:08] <%SirGO0SE> its all UPHILL FROM HERE BILLY
[2:48:08] <FirearmsInstructor> @TungstenViper from CVX?
[2:48:14] <tealwolf26> You basically beat the game already Kappa
[2:48:15] <daemos123> ceasare wants to know what you like about 6
[2:48:19] <%TheSphereHunter> the area after this is hook shot city unfortunately
[2:48:23] <rytisone> now cuddle with Rebecca

[2:48:34] <SMuffinMan> BILL LEE
[2:48:37] <TungstenViper> @FirearmsInstructor yeah?
[2:48:39] <Jolnir> This game has so little music
[2:48:40] <%SirGO0SE> becky go
[2:48:40] <+RowenCleric> god only having 6 items slots is such a dumb decision too
[2:48:41] <Fujiwara_92> yep, okay
[2:48:41] <trashcansan> okeh
[2:48:44] <%Laecerelius> And holding items for Billeh
[2:48:44] <+OwlLightningMage> YEAH
[2:48:48] <SMuffinMan> okay
[2:48:49] <%Solidnick18> becky why

[2:48:56] <%TomDanksEGOT> in Caddyshack in the scene where the Judge is talking to his putter (the golf club) isn;t it named Billy? someoen needs to clip that for Pat
[2:49:03] <FirearmsInstructor> @TungstenViper oh I wasn't sure if you were talking about CVX or this game. I didn't know if there was an extinguisher in this game.
[2:49:06] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @TungstenViper No literally, aim down with the knife. It stunlocks EVERYTHING. You can literally look down and spam an attack with the knife. ITS SOOOOO RIDICULOUSLY EASY. Try it for realz
[2:49:08] <%TheSphereHunter> but only one can use the hook
[2:49:10] <tealwolf26> Ssokay. I'll just stand here and bleed. Don't mind me.....Bleecch...
[2:49:24] <Sapphire_Breeze> go up Becky
[2:49:27] <%michingmallecho> It’s time for the old billy barue oh billy billy billy billy
[2:49:29] <%TheSphereHunter> NO!
[2:49:31] <Sapphire_Breeze> NO
[2:49:31] <+OwlLightningMage> ROG ERR
[2:49:32] <%TheSphereHunter> keep it
[2:49:32] <%natebud> NO
[2:49:33] <Sapphire_Breeze> BIG NO
[2:49:34] <BurdRightsActivist> Dude I wouldn't be able to play this game if my life was on the line, I NEED ALL MY STUFF
[2:49:36] <rcand9> nooo
[2:49:40] <%kingbaconcrispy> You need it in not too long
[2:49:42] <TungstenViper> @XeroSigmaPrime i ahve done it, and no, it's not that easy. you can't spam it. have YOU tried it?
[2:49:43] <%TheSphereHunter> lots of hook points coming up
[2:49:44] <Fujiwara_92> WAIT, FOLLOW, WAI-FOLLOW, WAI-FOLL-WAIT
[2:49:45] <rcand9> you big need
[2:49:49] <%EndlessScrapper> The Scorpion was named Stinger, and the centipede Centurion
[2:49:54] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @TungstenViper They give the the Extinguisher at the very beginning of the game... and it used near the end.
[2:50:01] <%tiaramaki> RPD lobby, I think?
[2:50:01] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat It's part of a cutscene in RE2
[2:50:06] <+Eddy21forsaken> there's no hook shot in umbrella chronicles.... play umbrella chronicles
[2:50:06] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Isn't it the RE 2 song?
[2:50:09] <%Taisuru> RE2 for sure
[2:50:12] <+wvuboii> RE3 Save room music
[2:50:13] <+SlappyMeats> yeah it made me thing RPD lobby
[2:50:14] <+Mittensbro> Wow, this is like the anti-mind goblins for Pat. If you wanna horde all your items, you're gonna have to waste a buuuuunch of time
[2:50:15] <%spiritofmojave> The entrance to the police station?
[2:50:15] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @TungstenViper Yup literally did it this week. Hell even Pat did it majority of his playthru of CVX
[2:50:16] <daemos123> you are nuts
[2:50:17] <Guardiansaiyan> @AngriestPat you hear it when you first go into the police station
[2:50:17] <+SlappyMeats> think*
[2:50:18] <rytisone> just mostly
[2:50:19] <Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> @Fujiwara_92 ROYAL GUA-WAIT< FOLLOW
[2:50:20] <%TheSphereHunter> it's because RE2 is coming up...
[2:50:20] <rcand9> the police entance
[2:50:21] <%Basch71> definitely sounds kinda RE2 ish
[2:50:22] <daemos123> just not about this
[2:50:23] <$Blackgaver> @AngriestPat is it not the police station in re2?
[2:50:26] <FlashFrame> So, how crazy has pat ben for the playthrough so far?
[2:50:32] <cesare92x> in CVX player instruction, it clearly says to take all the items from the security box before leaving
[2:50:32] <%TheSphereHunter> it getting you ready subtly
[2:50:38] <%natebud> Pretty sane surprisingly
[2:50:38] <daemos123> normal levels of crazy
[2:50:39] <$shurtal> Magic elevator?
[2:50:39] <%dheng1> Yeah it is
[2:50:39] <+SlappyMeats> I'm hearing it very faintly tho
[2:50:42] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat When you first arrive into the police station and get the big camera pan up I think.
[2:50:43] <+RowenCleric> why that riff here though of all places
[2:50:45] <+AcidBrandon> Next time you use the hookshot DON'T send Billy, Send Becca instead. Will save you some headache
[2:50:46] <trashcansan> pretty sane
[2:50:50] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @TungstenViper If Pat could do it no problem, its definitely a problem lol
[2:50:51] <Fujiwara_92> @gr4ndm4rsh4ll GU-TRIC-SWO-GUN-SWO-TRIC--
[2:50:53] <%TheSphereHunter> the twilight zone elevator
[2:50:53] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> MAGIC
[2:50:59] <%natebud> Magic has never been so lame
[2:51:01] <%peachy996> There is no need for that Pat
[2:51:03] <%Solidnick18> all aboard
[2:51:04] <$Blackgaver> does that elevetor need mana ? LUL
[2:51:04] <%TheSphereHunter> where the marshaling yard is in the sky
[2:51:07] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> how does it work tho?
[2:51:07] <+Cityscape17> wanka vator?
[2:51:08] <%asgard147> Magic Elevator you say?! limesPoggers
[2:51:09] <SMuffinMan> ROGER
[2:51:10] <arkv01> I'll show you a magic elevator DING DING
[2:51:10] <rytisone> it connects you with the spanish town in RE4
[2:51:12] <%Aydarkzero> i swear if this elevator goes sideways...
[2:51:12] <+SlappyMeats> impossible space?
[2:51:14] <%Basch71> time is convoluted in Raccoon City
[2:51:15] <Sapphire_Breeze> the Iron Keep elevator
[2:51:15] <%TheSphereHunter> it's the worst...
[2:51:16] <%peachy996> There is no need to go to RE2
[2:51:18] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I member the magic elevator
[2:51:20] <+OwlLightningMage> This game is so boring. Even magic elevators can't hype it up
[2:51:20] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Elevators often are
[2:51:21] <%trueherobappo> ??
[2:51:22] <%stevesekai> Which is more magic: this elevator or DS2?
[2:51:24] <%natebud> literallyrregergerqhahqh
[2:51:24] <cesare92x> and now werewolves in RE8...
[2:51:26] <@commanderclaw> Is it Earthen Peak tier?
[2:51:27] <+freeizone> magic?
[2:51:27] <daemos123> does it take you to a better game?
[2:51:28] <Ultimatefool> Is it like the Willy Wonka elevator?
[2:51:28] <FlashFrame> magic elevator?
[2:51:31] <%lionandfox21> do YOU have a magic elevator?
[2:51:32] <%TheSphereHunter> guys the elevator literally makes NO sense
[2:51:33] <%WhereIsWill> The magic wha?
[2:51:34] <%Faustgesicht> Elevator from church to....
[2:51:36] <%asgard147> limesAw apatWink
[2:51:40] <arkv01> do you love elmo enough to eat his ass? HOW DEEP IS YOUR LOVE?
[2:51:52] <@commanderclaw> @TheSphereHunter Like that one in Dark Souls 2?
[2:51:54] <rcand9> billy heal
[2:52:04] <%grandark_z317> @arkv01 Bro. Cringe. apatWhat
[2:52:05] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> @arkv01 yes
[2:52:09] <%Aydarkzero> so this is where B team got the inspiration for Dark Souls 2 Kappa
[2:52:12] <FirearmsInstructor> @arkv01 DansGame WutFace
[2:52:14] <TungstenViper> @XeroSigmaPrime pat could do it no problem with all the enemies... ok. i don't believe that. Also i can do it to if a itry hard enough but it's not that easy. you need to know the right frames to do it consistently
[2:52:15] <%luftraumm1> billeh
[2:52:16] <rytisone> I just assume the lab is the same design and not place
[2:52:16] <+OwlLightningMage> Dark Souls 2 had magic distances all over
[2:52:24] <morcego_cinzento_arts> At this point i don't even know why Umbrella bothered with trying to make and sell b.o.w's. If they can create magical elevators they would make trilions
[2:52:24] <+RayDaug> At least Dark Souls has straight up magic in it
[2:52:25] <%peachy996> Or put it in Canada
[2:52:29] <%Tearonex> the DS2 Elevator is pretty fucking dumb too
[2:52:35] <rcand9> lots of leaches coming up
[2:52:44] <emeraldskrull> Pat truly is a booger eater smh
[2:52:44] <%chill_o_wisp> I'm hardly paying attention, but I am enjoying hanging out with you and Elmo
[2:52:46] <%Aydarkzero> @Tearonex are you talking about the one the leads to Iron Keep?
[2:52:46] <daemos123> ds2 at least has weird dream logic in other parts of the game
[2:52:52] <cesare92x> hope Billy has enough 1s for them stripping agents
[2:52:56] <%natebud> You have the green so you should be good. No trips back to the mansion for you
[2:52:59] <%Aydarkzero> i mean video games why not
[2:53:02] <Sapphire_Breeze> do it becky
[2:53:04] <%Tearonex> @Aydarkzero yes
[2:53:07] <%Faustgesicht> Billy Bekey Spency Wesky Birky
[2:53:11] <rcand9> i like this game in a weird way
[2:53:12] <%Lion_kun> Lion_kun subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 24 months, currently on a 24 month streak! RE0 is a good game, I'll die on this hill! I really like this game! Bring Rebecca and Billy back for Rev 3!
[2:53:14] <%Aydarkzero> @Tearonex love the elevator haha
[2:53:20] <+BionoidLCR> why would anyone write that down lol
[2:53:23] <+OwlLightningMage> This game is boring
[2:53:23] <arkv01> aren't we a couple hours from the end
[2:53:24] <Zaphire_Saucypants> this door locks, doesn't it?
[2:53:28] <%peachy996> At least Silent Hill has the excuse that the town is actively fucking with you
[2:53:35] <+AugustHaze> Deep breaths Pat
[2:53:39] <+BionoidLCR> @Lion_kun oh fuck off lol
[2:53:40] <%Laecerelius> Bekeh no gun?
[2:53:49] <cesare92x> revealing that Billy is still alive would be a nice revelation in Rev3
[2:53:51] <$RealThiele> billy is all like ok karen
[2:53:52] <%Tearonex> @Aydarkzero Literally could've been fixed by it going down
[2:53:59] <%lionandfox21> Guy I hate my Physical Chemistry instructor, THIS SEMESTER IS GOING TO SUCK
[2:53:59] <Ner234> Becky wecky
[2:53:59] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Ignorant optimism and momentary lapse in judgement
[2:54:01] <Kabaltheraven> @peachy996 That is a really good point
[2:54:02] <TungstenViper> also, are you guys really saying that RE0 is better than CV?
[2:54:06] <%natebud> Isn't there a green chemical on the second floor of this place?
[2:54:11] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @TungstenViper Watch Pat's playthru, he trivialized the entire intro with the knife. Technically the hardest enemy to kill with the knife is the regular zombies in the Antartica base lower levels. They nearly never get staggered. Thats the only section the someone should not try the knife
[2:54:11] <rcand9> yup
[2:54:12] <daemos123> yes
[2:54:13] <%stevesekai> Billy for RE8! I'm telling y'all!
[2:54:16] <%trueherobappo> @AngriestPat So do we need a Becky counter too?
[2:54:17] <FlashFrame> CV is a mess.
[2:54:18] <+akingofnoobs> akingofnoobs subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months! 
[2:54:20] <+OwlLightningMage> I don't know which is worse LUL
[2:54:22] <daemos123> cvx has worst finale in the series
[2:54:23] <%Monkeyweed21> @TungstenViper CVX has Steve-Necrid
[2:54:26] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Becky can do it!
[2:54:27] <%Laecerelius> BEKEH THE STASH!
[2:54:28] <Ner234> Becky Wecky Hecky
[2:54:28] <rcand9> no contest 0 beats cvx
[2:54:29] <daemos123> almost unplayable
[2:54:30] <Fujiwara_92> shut up pat, becky cool
[2:54:32] <%natebud> CVX has the worst everything
[2:54:33] <trulythedude> any part that doesn't suck?
[2:54:34] <%TheSphereHunter> Bekky is POWERFUL
[2:54:34] <%spiritofmojave> CV gives us Alfred, so I'd say that
[2:54:34] <+MzSteele5150> You think they'll make a 3rd Revelations game?
[2:54:35] <$RealThiele> cvx has more jank and is less boring
[2:54:36] <ShichiNoBushi> The S is for "Sucks".
[2:54:38] <TungstenViper> @rcand9 LUL
[2:54:39] <%SirGO0SE> big becky energy
[2:54:40] <jijipose> Becky best girl
[2:54:42] <xxshadowxx416> beck cool
[2:54:45] <Ran196> Becky is Wesker's waifu
[2:54:47] <rcand9> becky time to shine
[2:54:50] <Fujiwara_92> BEST BECKY GURL
[2:54:51] <%Lion_kun> The lack of item boxes suck and some bosses are really bad but the level design and characters are great. And I love all the Wesker and Birkin bonding time scenes.
[2:54:52] <TalisKanju> I am NOT saying that RE0 is better than CV
[2:54:56] <%natebud> Becky is bad at doing things
[2:54:59] <%stevesekai> Becky's the hero of RE0
[2:55:00] <arkv01> becky has great ass... for suffocating zambos
[2:55:00] <cesare92x> I like CVX overall, could have been much much much worse
[2:55:00] <TungstenViper> @Monkeyweed21 Steve sure is a badly handled character
[2:55:02] <rytisone> fire good
[2:55:05] <%trueherobappo> BECKY COUNTER: 20
[2:55:06] <Zaphire_Saucypants> document
[2:55:07] <gekizenbu> i forgot didnt one of the RE spinoffs had like, the twin incest clones or something
[2:55:08] <+PanicSwytch> FLUTE MAN LUL
[2:55:09] <%SirGO0SE> BECKY #1 BECKY
[2:55:10] <%Lion_kun> 0 actually feels good and is fun to play, CVX is a trashfire.
[2:55:11] <+chunkymonkey737> drink gasoline to move faster
[2:55:12] <trashcansan> Becky or Jill tho. which hat is better
[2:55:12] <Zaphire_Saucypants> you passed by a document I think
[2:55:13] <Ner234> Oh nooo
[2:55:13] <+AcidBrandon> Another reason why this game sucks. If you send Billy and don't have the chem for Becca she has to go all the way back to the mansion
[2:55:14] <%Laecerelius> LEECH FLUTE!
[2:55:17] <DracaenaLeaf> sudden music change what

[2:55:28] <+WheatlyXT> I just want to go back to the train
[2:55:29] <%Monkeyweed21> you missed a file
[2:55:32] <%EndlessScrapper> If Billy was in RE8 he be in his mid 40's. I mean they've had older playable characters like Barry.
[2:55:33] <FlashFrame> unpopular opinion, RE4 killed survivor horror for a while, and we're only now starting to get back into survival horror being Horror again after the genre shift to action.
[2:55:33] <King_Wolf_Rigger> FLUTE AT RISK
[2:55:34] <$Blackgaver> read that file
[2:55:35] <%spiritofmojave> Fluteman really earning his wage

[2:55:57] <%kingbaconcrispy> @FlashFrame Pretty common actually
[2:55:58] <Sapphire_Breeze> SourPls
[2:55:58] <%SirGO0SE> this good art
[2:55:58] <Ran196> rip in piece becky
[2:55:59] <%natebud> If you intentionally split the characters up, the game becomes a little more entertaining, but there's no practical reason to do that.
[2:56:00] <StripesUltimateEdition> :flute:
[2:56:01] <%TaphexWin> I love this flute man
[2:56:08] <cesare92x> flute trigger increasing

[2:56:26] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Bug Island was wild
[2:56:29] <%Lion_kun> There's an eliminator.
[2:56:31] <FlashFrame> @kingbaconcrispy I'd agree if so many people wern't like "But RE 4 is best 5 evah!"
[2:56:32] <%Lion_kun> There's two.
[2:56:37] <FirearmsInstructor> Don't you need to use the hook like .... WAY too much here? D:
[2:56:38] <cesare92x> ..a cable car, here?...
[2:56:51] <%natebud> Two eliminators sitting on eachother shoulders in an overcoat
[2:56:54] <rcand9> make sure billy no attack
[2:56:56] <%kingbaconcrispy> @FlashFrame Well it's common for Re purist cummerdgeons like me.
[2:56:56] <rytisone> become batman
[2:56:57] <$RealThiele> But RE 4 is best 5 evah!
[2:56:59] <$Blackgaver> just breath pat.... it's ok.... dying 30 times in here is fine... just breath
[2:57:01] <Fujiwara_92> when will we get the mod that changes the eliminators to just dudes with flutes
[2:57:14] <%stevesekai> I want to make a video about how much I've loved this series from the sideline but rewatching this and CVX make me rething that love...
[2:57:16] <%EndlessScrapper> I want to see Ashley. Like Ashley got some freaking training after being kidnapped and major bioterror attacks hit the US
[2:57:16] <trashcansan> it's literally just proto death stranding
[2:57:21] <rcand9> billy might be attack
[2:57:24] <FirearmsInstructor> Don't have to carry anything if you git gud haznoThink
[2:57:32] <cesare92x> what's the point of Leech theme up there while Leech guy is downstairs
[2:57:33] <tusk102> @AngriestPat the eliminators get switched to the sword monkeys from sekiro
[2:57:39] <%maskofmichael> It's All The Bad Part
[2:57:40] <%Aydarkzero> correct me if i' wrong but you never actually get a upgrades to what you can carry right?
[2:57:40] <$Blackgaver> it's a bad time
[2:57:43] <%natebud> Not the worst at least.
[2:57:44] <%SirGO0SE> protek the bek
[2:57:44] <$Blackgaver> BILLY!
[2:57:44] <+OwlLightningMage> Ashley teams up with Adult Sherry to form the kidnapped squad
[2:57:46] <%Lion_kun> You know a shortcut opens up to the hallway eventually

[3:04:32] <glass_half_broken> I prefer Billys feet
[3:04:34] <King_Wolf_Rigger> It's because you're short and use the metric system

[3:04:38] <%Aydarkzero> monkaS
[3:04:38] <+chunkymonkey737> i knew someone with a foot fetish but hated anyone walking around without socks on
[3:04:39] <morcego_cinzento_arts> We should be talking about leon's mad feet skills in RE4
[3:04:40] <Valentinius_Anodyne> From what I understand, it's because the brain wires mix up feet with genitals
[3:04:40] <Azathotic> Stop kinkshaming Pat
[3:04:42] <+DiabloDeAzul> at least feet is a reversible fetish, unlike the likes of amputation
[3:04:43] <Nina96> the whole leg i get but not feet on there own
[3:04:43] <Ner234> Most of us don't get it either. We're just messing with you.

[3:04:55] <%luftraumm1> I don't know why but hearing about Ada's huge feet made me remember "woolie's big white leg"
[3:04:57] <FirearmsInstructor> So my friend told me she's been offered actual money for pictures of her toes. is this *ACTUALLY* a thing? Is there a market for that? I'm 99% sure she's trolling me. Is that a thing?

[3:09:01] <%natebud> You'd still have made the same mistake you did just now with a full inventory
[3:09:03] <%Aydarkzero> oh...
[3:09:05] <Nina96> wow
[3:09:05] <%NWR_James> There is an item box, her name is Rebecca
[3:09:05] <ElenaManetta> Maybe this game is okay for people who don't mind fuck ups with their limited items
[3:09:05] <+CyroGhostX> haha
[3:09:06] <FirearmsInstructor> HOLY SHIT
[3:09:06] <Fujiwara_92> WOW LUL

[3:09:10] <majima666> justice for STEVE
[3:09:10] <%kingbaconcrispy> At least Code Veronica makes you feel negative emotions.
[3:09:11] <%the_vedo_show> atpRtsd agreed
[3:09:11] <+MzSteele5150> Flush this crap game
[3:09:11] <Guardiansaiyan> ooooh
[3:09:12] <+wmeldrum> whhhhoaa
[3:09:12] <rcand9> oh noo Kappa
[3:09:12] <$RealThiele> i called it

[3:09:13] <%spiritofmojave> OFC it is, it's hammier
[3:09:14] <sackerkappa> The beef jerky monster is too strong for Pat right now.
[3:09:14] <%Monkeyweed21> PAT REMEMBER NECRID STEVE
[3:09:15] <+OwlLightningMage> Both of these are dogshit bad
[3:09:15] <Guardiansaiyan> wow
[3:09:16] <Huntercd> Why does she only have four slots?
[3:09:16] <+PanicSwytch> BUT...BILLY
[3:09:17] <FirearmsInstructor> BIG FUSTATED!!!

[3:09:19] <$RealThiele> its boring and tedious and bullshit
[3:09:23] <thetruenicster> wow, just got in and already a bad take
[3:09:24] <Nina96> @AngriestPat BUT STEVE
[3:09:25] <Lulu19> dont SAY IT
[3:09:25] <+ultimafullmetal> But cvx looks ugly and has Steve
[3:09:26] <%Chatterbox1991> Pat dont be foolish now! think of Steve
[3:09:27] <%Binary_Fireball> BECKY is a mobile item box no?
[3:09:29] <trashcansan> Sleepy > Grumpy
[3:09:29] <%WhereIsWill> he's only saying that cuz he knee deep in the BS CHAT
[3:09:30] <TalisKanju> Code Veronica has an item box, this game doesn't. CVX > RE0
[3:09:31] <%ssjklyco> Dropping items would be better if item boxes were also in the game.
[3:09:31] <%Mr_Pylon> I can't wait for 6 when it takes the top spot again
[3:09:33] <cesare92x> you need to play without streaming and with patience to enjoy this one
[3:09:33] <+chunkymonkey737> this game....is...ASSSS
[3:09:33] <%natebud> See Pat has imagination. He's pretending that wasn't his fault
[3:09:34] <+Eddy21forsaken> you wanna replay CVX to confirmed your decision?
[3:09:34] <+Jaysky> Just take a look at THIS
[3:09:40] <%peachy996> Moths in CVX though
[3:09:41] <%InugamiTheHound> you didn't have this much trouble with the lp on the channel
[3:09:46] <%unclekulikov> apatElmo apatElmo
[3:09:48] <ElenaManetta> The longer you take, the more slots it'll take up on the schedule. That means LESS PLANNING YEAAAH
[3:09:48] <%EndlessScrapper> apatPat
[3:09:49] <%Laecerelius> Pat prefers Steve over Flute Man
[3:09:49] <thelonechris> *Flute intensifies*
[3:09:50] <+RaziWraith> If devs said we will put ONE item box in this game, where should they put it? @AngriestPat
[3:09:50] <idfk_panda> apatPat
[3:09:51] <%SirGO0SE> DOOT
[3:09:52] <Sapphire_Breeze> SourPls
[3:09:52] <Fujiwara_92> Steve in CVX tho
[3:09:53] <+OwlLightningMage> Steve is terrible but funny terrible. This is just boring terrible
[3:09:53] <rcand9> pat need rest
[3:09:54] <%vectorless_peon> Wow didnt think the hate would go that far!
[3:09:58] <trulythedude> do you HAVE to kill them?
[3:09:59] <Nitro7Ninja> I get that....but Steve tho @angriestpat
[3:09:59] <$RealThiele> steve 10/10
[3:10:00] <%stevesekai> CVX gave a bad name to us Steve's
[3:10:04] <+Jaysky> DUN DUN
[3:10:06] <%NWR_James> I think a CVX replay i required as an apology to the CVX devs
[3:10:06] <tusk102> pat uses his imagination to pretend he did nothing wrong apatPat
[3:10:06] <+reknownblackcat> @AngriestPat When you get to RE4 you should do a 0 death Professional run. Just a suggestion.
[3:10:07] <TalisKanju> Steve is nothing close to funny
[3:10:07] <FirearmsInstructor> DON'T MISS
[3:10:08] <Kabaltheraven> The flautists have arrived
[3:10:08] <majima666> you can meme the fuck out of steve

[3:10:15] <%natebud> My inventory was full. Worse than CVX
[3:10:17] <+CyroGhostX> just remove Steve from Code Veronica and you got a really good game
[3:10:20] <ElenaManetta> HE'S DANCING
[3:10:22] <$RealThiele> strings guy isnt holding back either
[3:10:24] <TalisKanju> Alfred Ashford, on the other hand, is hilarious

[3:10:41] <%EndlessScrapper> FLUTE SLAUGHTERED
[3:10:48] <tusk102> flute slaughtered
[3:10:49] <$RealThiele> PREY FLUTED
[3:10:55] <majima666> its so sad that this is the last original style re game
[3:10:59] <Zaphire_Saucypants> now for moar flute
[3:11:00] <majima666> what a bum note to end on
[3:11:01] <%Monkeyweed21> Is it ACTUALLY worse than CVX or is that your mind goblins talking?
[3:11:05] <%luftraumm1> flute preyed
[3:11:07] <%natebud> @CyroGhostX what about all the bad levels, enemies and bosses
[3:11:09] <cesare92x> this RE must be played with calm and patience, playing on stream gets you distracted and rushed
[3:11:12] <%Binary_Fireball> is Nick Cage the flute man?
[3:11:14] <Sapphire_Breeze> SourPls
[3:11:17] <+OwlLightningMage> This game is pretty bad.
[3:11:17] <majima666> i suppose thats why they had to change it around
[3:11:21] <%Bluwizard21> @AngriestPat What if they designed the game around you carrying excess items? Like you always had too many items and just had to live with passing up items or using them then and there to pick up something else?
[3:11:24] <%SirGO0SE> I lol literally everytime the flute kicks in
[3:11:27] <+WutangchickeN> carciBLOCKED carciBLOCKED carciBLOCKED carciBLOCKED carciBLOCKED carciBLOCKED carciBLOCKED carciBLOCKED carciBLOCKED carciBLOCKED carciBLOCKED carciBLOCKED carciBLOCKED carciBLOCKED carciBLOCKED carciBLOCKED carciBLOCKED carciBLOCKED carciBLOCKED carciBLOCKED carciBLOCKED

[3:11:31] <+PanicSwytch> Man does he love his flutes
[3:11:36] <$GameOverDeo> lol I thought he was gonna reset again
[3:11:37] <$RealThiele> designed around it being bad then
[3:11:41] <King_Wolf_Rigger> The flute is so good
[3:11:42] <thelonechris> "What's an instrument we can use for a scary theme?" "How about a flute?"
[3:11:43] <tusk102> @AngriestPat pat you got fucked up just as many times in the other games
[3:11:46] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Pat, remember: Hunters had NO DEATH RATTLE
[3:11:46] <%InugamiTheHound> hoes mad
[3:11:47] <%XeroSigmaPrime> HOES MAD x 30
[3:11:49] <%the_vedo_show> apatPat

[3:11:55] <$RealThiele> ARTISTS MAD
[3:11:55] <someyounguy1> is pat the hoes mad now?
[3:12:00] <+Jokobeast> ...the world was going to roll you?
[3:12:01] <%WhereIsWill> flutes mad x24
[3:12:05] <%Malchiah_Tenabre> Malchiah_Tenabre subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months! I appreciate you playing these shitty RE games so that I dont have to so much. I might have given up playing the series if i had touched RE-Zero.
[3:12:13] <Plague_bagel> but ZAPPING tho
[3:12:16] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I dropped the hookshot in this room actually
[3:12:18] <%Mindtrick_Matt> Or if it didnt take up two slots
[3:12:20] <Zaphire_Saucypants> so you good
[3:12:22] <ElenaManetta> YEAH! thats the way to defeat the goblins
[3:12:24] <$RealThiele> acceptance stage
[3:12:25] <ElenaManetta> JUST DON'T eVEN CARE
[3:12:25] <%natebud> Actually the best place to drop it
[3:12:26] <%PauliusMaximus> the hookshots last use is the tram
[3:12:28] <tusk102> re 0 zapping system tho
[3:12:29] <chambatron> Is there a mod on pc that has a chest?
[3:12:34] <ElenaManetta> nihilism with inventory baby
[3:12:37] <Fujiwara_92> just don't care 4Head
[3:12:41] <Roz_Lynd> the fucking inventory in resident evil has been trash in every game that isn't 4
[3:12:42] <trulythedude> FBPass FBBlock FBSpiral
[3:12:42] <%SirGO0SE> @chambatron no, only wet becky mods
[3:12:55] <$RealThiele> being bad
[3:12:58] <cesare92x> all the items should have been 1 slot due to lack of item boxes
[3:12:58] <TalisKanju> @AngriestPat Would this inventory system be better if there weren't items that took up two slots?
[3:13:00] <%peachy996> RE5 has flaws
[3:13:02] <+OwlLightningMage> This game has many flaws
[3:13:02] <$GameOverDeo> this is that tweet again
[3:13:03] <%NWR_James> That flaw is tank controls
[3:13:03] <+mgskomododragon> examples?
[3:13:05] <%Monkeyweed21> CVX had A LOT of flaws
[3:13:05] <%peachy996> But you'll get to them
[3:13:06] <%TheMattman1313> Is 6's problem length?
[3:13:06] <Ultimatefool> RE6 is overall trash though
[3:13:07] <+OwlLightningMage> Wrong
[3:13:07] <rcand9> 6 has many
[3:13:09] <+Jokobeast> You heard it here first. Every RE game is trash. :P
[3:13:09] <Octocon> pat is a meme when he talks about RE
[3:13:10] <%natebud> They all have many many flaws. You're crazy
[3:13:12] <Huntercd> Wet Becky? wuff wuff
[3:13:12] <@commanderclaw> I wouldn't call "level design" in CVX a "Singular flaw"
[3:13:14] <+Eddy21forsaken> this would be less frustrating if you played the superior version of 0 in Umbrella Chronicles
[3:13:14] <+OwlLightningMage> They have lots of flaws
[3:13:15] <%Sausious> re5 is awful
[3:13:15] <%maskofmichael> By a single flaws?
[3:13:17] <+FOGSHIE> Not RE5, it has so many flaws
[3:13:17] <$RealThiele> cvx you can see the jank incoming though
[3:13:18] <%lionandfox21> BORING
[3:13:22] <+OwlLightningMage> Pat is super wrong
[3:13:22] <+chunkymonkey737> name one bad thing about REmaster zfgMad
[3:13:25] <+FOGSHIE> RE6*
[3:13:25] <%natebud> Albanoid
[3:13:33] <%natebud> nothing else
[3:13:36] <cesare92x> what do you like about RE 6
[3:13:36] <%peachy996> RE5 is only fun with your friend but as a single player game compared to RE4? fuck man
[3:13:37] <$RealThiele> RE4: Leeeeeeon
[3:13:38] <+OwlLightningMage> All the bad ones have many bad things
[3:13:39] <idfk_panda> re5?
[3:13:41] <FirearmsInstructor> SHADOW PUZZLESSSSSS
[3:13:42] <%peachy996> It's flawed
[3:13:42] <majima666> REmake doesnt have the option for the original voices
[3:13:43] <xxshadowxx416> what re 6
[3:13:43] <rcand9> this games bad because its 6
[3:13:46] <%Shadowpint> Eh, I still think CVX is worse than 0
[3:13:47] <majima666> you do have a point
[3:13:48] <TalisKanju> You can see the jank in CVX from the opening cutscene
[3:13:52] <%Bluwizard21> @AngriestPat On a similar note, I am finally playing through the witcher 3. I keep having to stop all progress and go back to either dump into my chest or sell off items. I had the same problem in skyrim. I have plenty of money, but fuck I can't stop picking up everything and selling it.
[3:13:52] <+OwlLightningMage> Pat is super wrong
[3:13:52] <%lethallunacyx> There's all kinds of bad things in CVX
[3:13:56] <%NWR_James> "You can point to a single thing, that's bad, and say this game's really bad because of this: RE6 is bad because of one singular thing, it's a bad game"
[3:14:01] <$Teh_Un> apatGib
[3:14:03] <cesare92x> what do you like about RE6 pat?
[3:14:04] <Fujiwara_92> Re6 is the opposite, it only has one good point, and that's Leon's campaign
[3:14:04] <+chunkymonkey737> @majima666 oh my COD
[3:14:05] <+OwlLightningMage> This game has many bad things
[3:14:06] <King_Wolf_Rigger> The Shadow Puzzles were a great part of RE7
[3:14:10] <%EndlessScrapper> A dumb moment I had was in RE Outbreak File 1. In the first scenario you find a nail gun. Little kid me thought the nail gun was just a bonus gun since you could use it as such. Your actually suppose to use it to block off the zombies to give yourself more time to figure out how to proceed.
[3:14:10] <%Monkeyweed21> CVX has way more flaws than one
[3:14:11] <$RealThiele> this game tries to hide its jank so you feel betrayed
[3:14:14] <+Brando_Brando> i did
[3:14:14] <%tiaramaki> apatGib apatGib
[3:14:14] <%Ranryu692> ENCORE
[3:14:16] <rcand9> cvx was design and style
[3:14:17] <$GameOverDeo> RE5 a single egg takes up an inventory slot like a shotgun
[3:14:21] <trulythedude> blah blah blah
[3:14:21] <ElenaManetta> I wish more people would talk about creative and gameplay decisions in old games. Like, "Why did this game from 2005 do this thing that people hate?". It might shed some light on modern day gameplay choices
[3:14:24] <%NWR_James> Giraffe getting a BJ is the singular thing that ruins RE6
[3:14:27] <%maskofmichael> yes, good song, sing more
[3:14:29] <tusk102> @AngriestPat pat you got fucked up just as many times in the other games why are you so maddened by this game
[3:14:30] <Roz_Lynd> yeah i was saying that before twitch shat me in limbo
[3:14:32] <ElenaManetta> Like maybe there are corporate reasons we aren't aware of, I don't know!
[3:14:39] <+luketrapwalker> GIVE PAT A GRAMMY
[3:14:44] <Roz_Lynd> the fucking inventory system has been horseshit in every resident evil that isn't 4
[3:14:44] <rcand9> resi 0 is item box and animals
[3:14:54] <cesare92x> What do you like about RE6 Pat?
[3:15:01] <%SirGO0SE> @ElenaManetta thats why I loved magazines like Nintendo Power and Game Informer growing up
[3:15:02] <%lethallunacyx> This game just needs boxes and less stupid animal zombies
[3:15:12] <Octocon> RE0 looks soo good
[3:15:16] <+arancet> the gameplay is fun, it just drags badly
[3:15:17] <+freeizone> amazing mechanics garbage campaign
[3:15:24] <majima666> i still need to do 6 and 7
[3:15:29] <%natebud> Boring unnecesary repeated levels
[3:15:29] <+Jokobeast> Yeah, that's probably fair.
[3:15:30] <someyounguy1> whats so bad about punch wesker?
[3:15:31] <King_Wolf_Rigger> I bet there are people who think RE4 is the worst of them all.
[3:15:31] <Plague_bagel> you mean 1/3 of the time
[3:15:31] <%NWR_James> RE0's item box wear a beret and has a gun!
[3:15:32] <xxshadowxx416> how parts
[3:15:33] <the_millenial_falcon> When I see zombies in hazmat suits I think about how super shitty those suits must be.
[3:15:33] <TalisKanju> That's a HOT TAKE right there
[3:15:34] <%InugamiTheHound> too man qtes I wish the game had less of them
[3:15:36] <%Laecerelius> I'd imagine they don't have an item box in this in order to force you to use the item dropping mechanic that they probably worked so hard on implementing.
[3:15:36] <rcand9> all the shooty ones
[3:15:39] <%luftraumm1> leon is great at the start
[3:15:39] <@commanderclaw> I want RE6's combat in a non RE game
[3:15:43] <$RealThiele> punch wesker =/= punch boulder
[3:15:43] <Fujiwara_92> Wesker junior and Leon presidency run are the only good things in re6
[3:15:44] <%lethallunacyx> The re team could really benefit from someone who's good at monster design
[3:16:02] <tusk102> it would be cool to not see the same 2 monsters repeatedly
[3:16:03] <glass_half_broken> The battletoads jet skiing was awful
[3:16:10] <%SirGO0SE> RE-0 was REALLY well recieved when it came out. Average scores of like a B+ lol
[3:16:13] <ElenaManetta> WAH

[3:17:29] <OswaldTheDog> see you later man
[3:17:32] <tusk102> he could have just backed up into the other hallway so that he had a clear view instead of camera changing 35 times
[3:17:32] <+zabando> If the flute wasn't on that track, it would actually be tense. But it's just ridiculous.
[3:17:32] <%kingbaconcrispy> Pat is going to run after Paige with an aex
[3:17:38] <%peachy996> All you have to do is finish this game and you can play hours of RE4
[3:17:38] <+Jokobeast> Don't worry, Billy. Your Billy's happiness is all that Billy.
[3:17:38] <%kingbaconcrispy> Heeeeere's Billy!

[3:18:00] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Three hours and the amount of progress is so close to none. What a good game.
[3:18:01] <cureneckbeard> Guys I had the best idea. What if we get Paige to cosplay Crazy Talk and Pat to cosplay Pat

[3:18:49] <TalisKanju> Pat doesn't have the luxury of bringing Mr. Snip-Snip to cut out the jank of these games
[3:18:49] <%Faustgesicht> He was at a Billy every 15 seconds during that Bat fight
[3:18:50] <cureneckbeard> Paige could follow Pat around at conventions cosplaying Crazy Talk and people would be like, wow! it's pat and his stand

[3:18:51] <%Aydarkzero> you missed big art

[3:21:38] <%lionandfox21> Dumb bitch
[3:21:38] <Captain_Joe1911> you did it
[3:21:41] <%peachy996> Cuz RE4 is relatively stress free
[3:21:41] <King_Wolf_Rigger> The flute lends its strength
[3:21:45] <%EndlessScrapper> Credit where credit is due when Becky backs up slowly the animation actually makes it seem shes backing away in fear
[3:21:45] <Sloavon> this music isn't even tense after a while
[3:21:57] <rcand9> always wait for leech to change before throwing
[3:21:57] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat No more bottles on the shelf, right?
[3:22:02] <%peachy996> Not easy per se but none of the mindnumbing stressful shit in CVX or 0
[3:22:06] <cesare92x> try and wait this time then dump napalm on it
[3:22:06] <%SirGO0SE> What section of the museum does this go in?
[3:22:09] <Fujiwara_92> the flute is the best part of 0
[3:22:09] <SchroedingersFerret> I love how it looks like they explode into little turds
[3:22:15] <+chunkymonkey737> this game isn't sexy enough calebCB
[3:22:21] <+Prince_Kaboom> Yah Rebecca <3 <3 <3 <3
[3:22:24] <Zaphire_Saucypants> always 3 or so
[3:22:25] <absolute_cagemony> I need to drink some water and calm the f down. I just read Pat's entire twitter feed for today
[3:22:26] <$RealThiele> like hotdogs and buns
[3:22:29] <Zaphire_Saucypants> increments of 3
[3:22:32] <Sloavon> FLOOT
[3:22:33] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> apatSmug_BW apatMenace apatCrazy apatCrazyhand apatCrazyhead apatMenace Are You Sure About That?
[3:22:33] <rytisone> cant skip the flute
[3:22:36] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> it's so you can piss in some
[3:22:37] <ElenaManetta> This music is crazy fast paced for the slowest enemies
[3:22:42] <%SirGO0SE> @absolute_cagemony phew you okay? thats a ride
[3:22:46] <ElenaManetta> I like the music but man it's like, 10 seconds of nothing
[3:22:48] <Captain_Joe1911> carciOWO
[3:22:48] <FirearmsInstructor> Do the bottles / fuel average out? Or are they super unbalanced?
[3:22:51] <ElenaManetta> before the enemy crawls up on screen
[3:22:52] <%WhereIsWill> !FLUTE AT RISK!
[3:22:59] <rcand9> why is the music distorted for that one bit?
[3:23:03] <FirearmsInstructor> Thanks
[3:23:06] <tusk102> @AngriestPat save the game as billy before fighting that leechman so you don't have to do beckys thing again
[3:23:09] <%Ranger747> @peachy996 The regenerators still freak me way out, mechanically and tonally, but yeah I see what you mean
[3:23:10] <%SirGO0SE> its for art
[3:23:21] <absolute_cagemony> I don't know what art is anymore, and I think I'm a nihilist now
[3:23:29] <Sloavon> NIce
[3:23:31] <Ran196> no HI-FI music for us peasants
[3:23:31] <rcand9> weird
[3:23:34] <filialpails> it means you're behind twitch is playing at 1.03x speed to try to catch you up
[3:23:37] <%peachy996> RE5 has those fuckin Reapers tho
[3:23:41] <ElenaManetta> Why isn't there a gameplay option to have Billy and Becky stand back-to-back the entire game and just have 360 degree attack range. wtf
[3:23:41] <%tiaramaki> Try pausing and unpausing. It's worked for me in the past
[3:23:46] <%WhereIsWill> music be in 240p LUL
[3:23:47] <%Laecerelius> Lo-fi flues to BILLEH to
[3:23:48] <Sloavon> FLU-
[3:23:53] <%EndlessScrapper> If they did ever make a REmake of this I demand there at least be a cutscene of the hookshot actually killing something. Its basically a spear gun.
[3:23:57] <TalisKanju> Reapers are both one of the best and one of the worst parts of RE5
[3:24:04] <Captain_Joe1911> somebody in chat? carciSmug
[3:24:07] <%SirGO0SE> TWITCH IS TAMPERING WITH YOUR ART?!
[3:24:09] <Cosairen> god that flute kills all tension
[3:24:18] <+kikanshat0masu> Gl pat
[3:24:24] <FirearmsInstructor> Yeah, if that happens, *PAUSE* the stream, wait 1 second, then *UNPAUSE*. You'll be caught up and not buffering.
[3:24:25] <ElenaManetta> So the Pat we're watching right now is even SLOWER in real time?
[3:24:27] <ElenaManetta> Like an old man?
[3:24:27] <%spiritofmojave> was wondering why it skipped ahead a bit ago, thought had too many tabs up or something LUL
[3:24:32] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> That happens sometimes to me and I always just refresh the page. It annoys me so much to be on a weird delay like that.
[3:24:35] <zayasu> @captain_joe1911 aris mod cirHi
[3:24:39] <Sloavon> basic enemies should not have theme music ever
[3:24:43] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @TalisKanju OHHHHHHH I LOVED REAPERS, FUCKING SICK
[3:24:44] <%peachy996> @TalisKanju My dreaded part is the ship cuz you got them, gun toting majini and two JJs
[3:24:52] <Captain_Joe1911> yo! @zayasu notekHug
[3:24:57] <FirearmsInstructor> @ElenaManetta .... that's fucking with my head LUL
[3:25:03] <%peachy996> Rocket Boys too if I recall
[3:25:09] <%SirGO0SE> becky do it
[3:25:12] <rcand9> pat save?
[3:25:16] <Cosairen> this game if it gets remade should be mandatory coop
[3:25:19] <Fujiwara_92> WE DO IT
[3:25:26] <%natebud> I'd save if I were you.
[3:25:30] <%SirGO0SE> billy say hi im billy
[3:25:31] <trulythedude> resident evil more like ResidentSleeper
[3:25:32] <%Laecerelius> RE0 the Reremake
[3:25:33] <absolute_cagemony> why is Revelations a bad game, I liked it a lot and Jill's butt was awesome
[3:25:37] <tusk102> @AngriestPat save the game
[3:25:47] <TalisKanju> Giant Instant Death cockroaches
[3:25:57] <%SirGO0SE> @absolute_cagemony 1st half and jills butt are amazing but 2nd half is o_o
[3:25:58] <Fujiwara_92> 4th times the charm
[3:25:59] <%peachy996> Actually Question for Chat: Have you played RE5 with a co-op partner with you as Sheva?
[3:26:01] <rcand9> but what if big trouble
[3:26:06] <%kingbaconcrispy> It's really the non jill parts in revelations that suck
[3:26:15] <FirearmsInstructor> I have deja-vu. Anyone else getting deja-vu? notkohThink
[3:26:16] <lightsout177> load tiimes between chars are instant is that because the area is just massive
[3:26:17] <%peachy996> Was it just me or is her qte on the final boss fucked up difficult
[3:26:17] <%natebud> Heat the billy
[3:26:18] <rcand9> ok
[3:26:19] <absolute_cagemony> I can see that. I mean, the swimming part wasn't amazing.
[3:26:21] <%EndlessScrapper> So Becky at 18 a age where half the US population is still in school is already a member of a special forces unit. She may even be younger then Chris in the airforce.
[3:26:30] <Sloavon> mmm Jill butt
[3:26:31] <%Laecerelius> Yeah I played as Sheva when I played with a friend. Rocked those sniper rifles!
[3:26:40] <%Maids4lyfe> Jill Sandwich
[3:26:43] <saberknight_> raccoon city had big budget issues
[3:26:53] <Fujiwara_92> Chris was 8 in his airforce days actually Kappa
[3:26:59] <%RushUnplugged> BEELEE
[3:26:59] <FirearmsInstructor> @EndlessScrapper Rebecca taught Chris how to fly a harrier.
[3:27:00] <Zaphire_Saucypants> mmm Peanut Butter and Jill Sammich
[3:27:01] <Captain_Joe1911> Rebecca is a child genius
[3:27:04] <daemos123> Chris and Leon need a teamup game
[3:27:08] <%SirGO0SE> billy power level ????
[3:27:09] <silverglove2012> RE:zero remake when?
[3:27:09] <rcand9> billy fight better
[3:27:09] <%natebud> Cool the billy
[3:27:12] <absolute_cagemony> Chris flew an F15 Tomcat out of his mom's vagina for birth.
[3:27:13] <Fujiwara_92> they really do
[3:27:14] <cesare92x> Billy the master of flute
[3:27:14] <%WhereIsWill> can confirm that you can totally be in special forces at 18
[3:27:14] <TalisKanju> Barry craves that Jill Sandwich
[3:27:14] <saberknight_> come on billy
[3:27:17] <%peachy996> Jill and Leon need a teamup game
[3:27:20] <armandolorian> why doesn't Paige suffer with you on these playthroughs?
[3:27:25] <saberknight_> beely
[3:27:30] <Zaphire_Saucypants> @peachy996 I would LOVE that
[3:27:30] <rcand9> thank god
[3:27:31] <FirearmsInstructor> @EndlessScrapper She learned in med school
[3:27:34] <$GameOverDeo> practice more
[3:27:36] <trulythedude> BlessRNG
[3:27:39] <%natebud> You could always use the flame rounds instead of the molotovs
[3:27:40] <%stevesekai> The next Remake should be Gaiden
[3:27:40] <Sloavon> Chris was a captain in every branch of the military by age 18
[3:27:41] <rcand9> billy safe
[3:27:42] <KaliasTV> He's going to start talking to Woolie like Billy soon
[3:27:43] <+Ell1ot> Billy is strong. You feed him every day
[3:27:46] <saberknight_> becky used a time turner
[3:27:48] <%EndlessScrapper> Yeah Im sure there are special forces at 18. Im sure there a rarity though
[3:27:48] <%thebeargoesHONK> clearly this is Elmo's fault
[3:27:56] <cesare92x> leave Paige out of this before they start talking about bagels and stuff
[3:28:00] <Fujiwara_92> why Chris, biggest of the RE protags, just doesn't eat the other ones
[3:28:00] <%ssjklyco> You in the Billy Club now
[3:28:07] <%SirGO0SE> elmo is a good billy
[3:28:07] <ElenaManetta> elmo wsa the lead gameplay designer for RE0
[3:28:09] <They_Call_Me_The_Fizz> SAVE THE BILLY, ELMO!
[3:28:15] <+ahdurian> GUYS WHY IS REBECCA SO CUTE?
[3:28:15] <Sloavon> SPOOKY FLUTE
[3:28:23] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> sugoiSchleep

[3:28:29] <saberknight_> beeely
[3:28:30] <tusk102> nice!!
[3:28:31] <rcand9> elmo wouldn't die to leach like a billy
[3:28:31] <ElenaManetta> guys im gonna cast fireball...
[3:28:33] <%Rain_Mage> Leech
[3:28:35] <Sapphire_Breeze> Good job Billy
[3:28:36] <%Laecerelius> THE FLUTE EVIL IS DEFEATED! For now...
[3:28:36] <FirearmsInstructor> Didn't even need to save
[3:28:46] <absolute_cagemony> FLUTE?! THATS ART!!!
[3:28:46] <+Jokobeast> @peachy996 I found most of the QTEs in RE5 stupid-hard. Gotta have some wild reflexes to do those first time, I think.
[3:28:52] <Fujiwara_92> 4863
[3:28:53] <FirearmsInstructor> @ElenaManetta Make sure to throw it and not fuck it up :|
[3:28:55] <%Rain_Mage> Good Job Billy making sure the Zambies don't touch this priceless art
[3:28:59] <$GameOverDeo> All that practice paid off
[3:29:04] <Zaphire_Saucypants> 4862 aint yet
[3:29:05] <saberknight_> zambabos
[3:29:07] <rcand9> becky back in town
[3:29:09] <%Laecerelius> RE5's QTEs were pretty dumb
[3:29:13] <Zaphire_Saucypants> 3 I mean
[3:29:13] <%Shadicara> The real art is the zombos killed along the way
[3:29:17] <%GalacticaPhanto> @jokobeast That was me in RE6
[3:29:22] <%SirGO0SE> billy here ready for billying
[3:29:23] <saberknight_> beeeeely
[3:29:23] <%peachy996> @Jokobeast I remember mashing so hard at the final Sheva qte it friction burned my hands
[3:29:30] <cesare92x> the worse QTE in RE5 Is Dodge Wesker shit in the dlc lost in nightmares
[3:29:32] <%ssjklyco> I cast magic missile at the darkness
[3:29:32] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I actually used Billy for this
[3:29:33] <Cosairen> SHEVA HURRY
[3:29:35] <Captain_Joe1911> sux
[3:29:35] <%natebud> This is kind of like an item box if you think about it.
[3:29:38] <absolute_cagemony> RE5 doesn't become a real RE game until you have the infinite Hand Cannon.
[3:29:39] <FirearmsInstructor> Wait, can you have Billy go up??
[3:29:39] <rcand9> i usually send billy
[3:29:45] <Zaphire_Saucypants> mmm
[3:29:54] <+ahdurian> when are you ever excited?
[3:29:56] <Sloavon> This game sucks
[3:30:01] <+thesw1tch> what a fun game mechanic
[3:30:03] <%natebud> Only problem is that there's no green chemical for Beky on the first floor
[3:30:05] <rcand9> so much busy work
[3:30:06] <%SirGO0SE> its just a phase of your art
[3:30:06] <Captain_Joe1911> Get excited! carciGasm
[3:30:08] <absolute_cagemony> I want an RE game called RE:Hand Cannon where you just have the hand cannon the entire game and nothing else.
[3:30:08] <FirearmsInstructor> Path is clear, though, right? You can shuttle shit, just takes time.
[3:30:08] <rytisone> leave 'em Kappa
[3:30:10] <Fujiwara_92> re0 the chore game
[3:30:15] <%Laecerelius> pat will be excited when he's playing RE4
[3:30:16] <+Eddy21forsaken> please get excite
[3:30:21] <%peachy996> Business Evil 0
[3:30:22] <%Shadicara> Just leave the items pat Kappa
[3:30:26] <FirearmsInstructor> It's busy work
[3:30:27] <Zaphire_Saucypants> so what game you thinkin of doin to wash this game off?
[3:30:27] <%Laecerelius> It's because it's so small
[3:30:28] <FirearmsInstructor> Chores yeah
[3:30:29] <+Jokobeast> @GalacticaPhanto Oof. I found the RE6 QTEs easier than 5, myself.
[3:30:30] <saberknight_> RE0: Beely and Becki's Foot Fungus Adventure
[3:30:31] <trulythedude> because you've played this before
[3:30:33] <WaxWitch> johnmiLAUGH
[3:30:35] <%SirGO0SE> death stranding 0
[3:30:36] <%Laecerelius> Small areas with lots of back tracking
[3:30:36] <+ahdurian> yeah just leave them pat. be a man
[3:30:39] <%Maids4lyfe> at this point I would stop caring and just start cheating
[3:30:39] <Fenlig> are there rotating animations though?
[3:30:41] <%stevesekai> RE0 is the Animal Crossing of Survival Horror
[3:30:41] <absolute_cagemony> It feels like chores and not exploring because you've played this game before many times.
[3:30:44] <@commanderclaw> What stream do you think this is?
[3:30:49] <%BingsAksolum> apatGoblin apatGoblin apatGoblin
[3:30:52] <%peachy996> Duty Evil 0
[3:30:52] <TalisKanju> @angriestpat RE0 the bottom of the barrel?
[3:30:52] <rcand9> "pick up your shit and move to the next section sir"
[3:30:53] <%ssjklyco> Skeleton
[3:30:54] <+Ell1ot> i want one a new puzzle to be just doing the dishes
[3:30:59] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Can you do it in chunks? Over time or plan it out a bit as you progress?
[3:31:00] <CursedNobleman> how are we doing! how much time is left in RE0? I just want to know when the best RE starts
[3:31:04] <+conradical> i misheard that as "mpreg coil"
[3:31:10] <%natebud> billy so studious
[3:31:12] <absolute_cagemony> MPREG????
[3:31:12] <Sapphire_Breeze> WOW
[3:31:14] <Zaphire_Saucypants> uh huh
[3:31:16] <absolute_cagemony> That's ART!!!
[3:31:16] <%NWR_James> ACTING
[3:31:19] <saberknight_> billy looks like a yakuza character
[3:31:19] <%spiritofmojave> WOOAAAAAH
[3:31:19] <Fujiwara_92> or grand son
[3:31:20] <+CaptainPyron> Just burn the place down and explore the woods instead! Nobody needs to know Billy or Becky's struggle.
[3:31:20] <%SirGO0SE> did someone say pat is mpreg?
[3:31:20] <absolute_cagemony> Cause you make something
[3:31:24] <$GameOverDeo> PogChamp
[3:31:24] <cesare92x> probably 3 hours left of game
[3:31:24] <Zaphire_Saucypants> it COULDN'T be the same person, coooould it?
[3:31:25] <Sloavon> sounded like Steve
[3:31:29] <%peachy996> You think that's bad? Enrico is comin up
[3:31:29] <rcand9> dont forget to save before "that" room
[3:31:29] <+moranprime> Kurt Russel Billy Coen time
[3:31:30] <%ssjklyco> it looks so dumb with the glasses
[3:31:32] <+conradical> in my defense, i'm not really paying attention here lol
[3:31:39] <tusk102> @AngriestPat are you gonna play re5 with randos online Kappa Kappa
[3:31:39] <%ssjklyco> like he's a scholar
[3:31:41] <SirBrawler18> Which is worse, 0 or Code Veronica?
[3:31:43] <$GameOverDeo> depends on PAt
[3:31:46] <%spiritofmojave> I don't trust like that
[3:31:51] <%Binary_Fireball> acting gold
[3:31:54] <%ssjklyco> Head up
[3:31:56] <arkv01> pat now is the time to draw strength from your inner speedrunner and POWER THROUGH this shit
[3:31:58] <absolute_cagemony> Getting pregnant is art because you make a thing that's just as messy and dumb as a Jackson Polluck painting
[3:31:58] <%peachy996> Enrico sounds so terrible in 0
[3:31:59] <arkv01> take tomorrow off
[3:32:00] <Captain_Joe1911> Pat said 0 is worse atpCap
[3:32:02] <Zaphire_Saucypants> mmmm glorious leeches
[3:32:06] <%peachy996> I kinda love it
[3:32:07] <rcand9> yay
[3:32:11] <Zaphire_Saucypants> fuck
[3:32:12] <%EndlessScrapper> I wanted to do a TMP only run of RE4 but its ammo is not super common to come by. I used the Chicago Typewriter to just do a complete playthrough just to have enough TMP ammo
[3:32:14] <%honeyman18> Billy why
[3:32:15] <+thesw1tch> you shot him so hard he lost his physics and clipped through the table
[3:32:16] <cesare92x> well could be 2 hours but count 1 of just backtracking for items
[3:32:16] <FirearmsInstructor> wow
[3:32:16] <+conradical> he said 0 is worse mostly because of the no item box
[3:32:22] <tusk102> @AngriestPat are you gonna play re5 with randos online Kappa Kappa
[3:32:22] <rcand9> billy push
[3:32:37] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Were you trying to track and hit manual reload?
[3:32:40] <%peachy996> DON'T DO THAT
[3:32:42] <Captain_Joe1911> doh >(
[3:32:43] <Zaphire_Saucypants> so you're gonna deal with the Sheva AI. Got it.
[3:32:43] <TalisKanju> Or it could be something really stupid like the leeches combining with his dying body and becoming a monster
[3:32:46] <Ran196> Play RE5 with the PS move
[3:32:48] <ElenaManetta> go get your maid becky to fetch it for you
[3:32:50] <%tank7013> That would be a super fun stream for everyone but Pat
[3:32:51] <%ssjklyco> That's the key to success
[3:32:52] <%Maids4lyfe> fuck this inventory system
[3:32:52] <%lionandfox21> Just leave?
[3:32:58] <SirBrawler18> I think last I played this I quit at the eliminators
[3:32:59] <%peachy996> RANDOS WILL PULL THE BRIDGE OUT FROM YOU IN THE TRIBAL SECTION
[3:33:00] <ElenaManetta> oh rebecatha
[3:33:02] <%natebud> And by randos he means people in this stream because no one else will be there
[3:33:05] <%kingbaconcrispy> Sheva AI is oay, don't give her anything important.
[3:33:05] <+ultimafullmetal> Elmo can be Sheva
[3:33:08] <Fenlig> RE5 with paige?
[3:33:09] <%Ranger747> @EndlessScrapper I like the determination
[3:33:10] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Sheva AI is literally better than players for most sections lol
[3:33:13] <absolute_cagemony> But @Maids4lyfe it's REALISTIC doesn't that increase your IMMERSION???
[3:33:14] <zenith0111> Wouldn't want the randos carrying you Kappa
[3:33:18] <+TechPriestJohnny> I'm playing RE5 at this very moment.
[3:33:22] <Huntercd> Bring in Fuggins for RE5 @AngriestPat
[3:33:29] <TalisKanju> Remember that minigame where you had to find 100 Green and Blue leech charms?
[3:33:30] <cesare92x> btw you'll play RE5 dlc included right?
[3:33:31] <absolute_cagemony> The answer is no cause that's not what immersion is.
[3:33:33] <%PerrinIsDead> I don’t get the stream title
[3:33:35] <%peachy996> The Bridge part in RE5 is so tense during Co-op
[3:33:37] <TriadOrion> Handgun and Rifle tend to work pretty well on your AI buddy, from what I remember
[3:33:39] <+SlappyMeats> I always gave her the submachine guns so she had lots of little useless bullets to waste
[3:33:44] <Lulu19> play re5 with elmo
[3:33:45] <+RowenCleric> I miss Fuggins, where has he been at
[3:33:45] <%peachy996> Because your friend might murder you
[3:33:45] <%Maids4lyfe> @absolute_cagemony LUL
[3:33:47] <+FrenchTact1cs> Most people still playing are competent
[3:33:52] <%tank7013> Sheva AI with the high damage handgun can actually do pretty good work
[3:33:55] <rcand9> the lickers section in 5 is 100 times tougher with real people
[3:33:55] <Captain_Joe1911> carciComfy
[3:33:57] <absolute_cagemony> @PerrinIsDead This is art, don't you see? Pat is an artist.
[3:34:00] <%ssjklyco> Sheva isn't real, so why should the person controlling her be real
[3:34:04] <SirBrawler18> I wish Rebecca stared in a better game.
[3:34:04] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Will you play Lost In Nightmares since that shit is hellah good?
[3:34:06] <%Maids4lyfe> elmo loves you and your succulent meats
[3:34:10] <%cylish> cylish subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 21 months! Wow really? Almost two years of this trash fire. Keep it up shitlord.
[3:34:10] <+junks2300> Pat are you going to Co-Op RE:5 with Elmo?
[3:34:21] <%SirGO0SE> Becky's nurse costume looks an awful lot like a french maid costume. Would be very appropriate
[3:34:25] <%lionandfox21> LOVE HIM MORE PAT
[3:34:33] <FirearmsInstructor> Not if you have a good partner.
[3:34:35] <%PerrinIsDead> @absolute_cagemony All I see is a Billeh
[3:34:38] <%Mindtrick_Matt> The AI is much slower though
[3:34:42] <%EndlessScrapper> Do a melee only playthrough of RE5. Its surprisingly fun. The shock baton is a very strong weapon
[3:34:44] <absolute_cagemony> BILLEH IS ART
[3:34:45] <%natebud> Not if you want to farm gems
[3:34:46] <FirearmsInstructor> Except that blind spot
[3:34:47] <%tank7013> But she makes up for that during the first Wesker fight where she makes EVERY mistake
[3:34:47] <+CaptainPyron> Elmo's ready to be big streamer man! He will play the rest of the games!
[3:34:48] <zenith0111> Me and my cousin breezed through 5
[3:34:50] <+FrenchTact1cs> Mistakes? Murder them all for swee tloot
[3:34:52] <+DashXero> I barely even remember lickers in RE5...
[3:34:55] <spacecatstreams> pap
[3:34:56] <%PerrinIsDead> Sorry this is a girl Billeh
[3:35:00] <Fenlig> re5 with mouse and keyboard makes it a lot easier
[3:35:01] <%kolmolgorov> should mod re:5 to be Billy and Becky
[3:35:02] <+reycharles75> reycharles75 subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[3:35:02] <%peachy996> Sheva is prone to stupid stuff though
[3:35:04] <%SirGO0SE> i beat re5 so quickly that i remember almost nothing about it
[3:35:05] <cesare92x> btw you'll play RE5 With the dlcs right?
[3:35:05] <ECRead> I return with a belly full of udon and sake. how's everyone doing?
[3:35:09] <FirearmsInstructor> WAIT do you need to shuttle EVERYTHING through that fucking box?!?
[3:35:17] <%Sadira_snack_attack> Wat? She instantly sprays herself with first aid as if it were bug repellent
[3:35:20] <Captain_Joe1911> @ECRead carciComfy
[3:35:28] <Lulu19> lol
[3:35:30] <%peachy996> You have to babysit her somewhat and make sure she has no way to heal herself
[3:35:30] <%TheMattman1313> HE'S TRYING OK
[3:35:33] <Captain_Joe1911> haha
[3:35:33] <SirBrawler18> Appreciate you streaming Pat ive been sik for 2 days because of allergies going nuts
[3:35:39] <%natebud> awesome
[3:35:39] <%lionandfox21> I remember re5 with my brothers and sister and we all took turns playing as Chris and Sheva, there was so much chaos
[3:35:40] <%stevesekai> He doin' push-ups
[3:35:40] <+ahdurian> no im blind
[3:35:42] <%Laecerelius> OH MY GOOOOOOOOOOOD!!
[3:35:43] <morcego_cinzento_arts> usually only play with Sheva with the cover Ai setting with the handgun. However once i completed the game and got most of my fave weapons maxed out i let her AI on the attack mode more often and with machine guns and the sniper rifle she is quite a good assist
[3:35:44] <%PerrinIsDead> Pat I guess I’ve been giving you a twitch prime sub for a few months now idk how many and idk if you’ve read my name but enjoy the free money
[3:35:48] <%Binary_Fireball> DIE GRANDPA
[3:35:50] <Captain_Joe1911> Elmo can't believe it
[3:35:51] <Fujiwara_92> he tried
[3:35:52] <ECRead> @Captain_Joe1911 doodGood
[3:35:53] <absolute_cagemony> Sheva gets chapped lips - sprays first aid spray on her face.
[3:35:55] <CursedNobleman> is elmo a chonk or a floof?

[3:36:14] <+Gondab> Elmo is a Choof

[3:36:17] <rcand9> poor guy arthritic zombo
[3:36:20] <JoelFleran> i played RE5 with my bother years ago and i remember us screaming as we battered a chainsaw dude to death, thinking he was gonna get out of the stun lock and kill one of us making us do the whole section again @AngriestPat

[3:36:35] <rcand9> yesss
[3:36:35] <Huntercd> Elmo Loaf
[3:36:36] <RumiaTrain> Why is Pat playing Zero when he was just talking smack about it?
[3:36:37] <%EndlessScrapper> You know I never had online services. When I got RE5 at launch I was pissed because single player wouldn't let you be Sheva.
[3:36:38] <KeiPrime> VeRSuS M0De?@
[3:36:38] <FirearmsInstructor> Wait what DLC?
[3:36:39] <%XeroSigmaPrime> FUCK YEA
[3:36:43] <%peachy996> They have Jill in them too
[3:36:45] <morcego_cinzento_arts> Also if you max out the very first sniper rifle you get, you can buy her bow, which is already infinite, does tons of damage and on the Ai that doesn't miss it's god tier

[3:37:06] <%ssjklyco> I wanna say that RE0 was probably made before REmake, but decided to push REmake out first, which is why REmake seems more polished
[3:37:07] <Captain_Joe1911> carciGasm
[3:37:10] <%lionandfox21> Good Jill outfit too!
[3:37:11] <%SirGO0SE> yes
[3:37:11] <Nina96> yes
[3:37:15] <%spiritofmojave> Probably
[3:37:15] <rcand9> what costumes we gonna run?
[3:37:15] <Fujiwara_92> y
[3:37:15] <%natebud> Jill has a worse hat in RE5
[3:37:17] <%LaughingCatt> that is a big possibility
[3:37:20] <KeiPrime> only one playable jill has a hat tho
[3:37:20] <%peachy996> You said so
[3:37:20] <%WhereIsWill> yes
[3:37:20] <%nofestu2> yes
[3:37:21] <%reycharles75> probably
[3:37:22] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I think it might be at the crux of it, so ye.
[3:37:23] <%Tracazoid> Quite likely it seems
[3:37:24] <FirearmsInstructor> Jill doesn't wear a hat, idiot.
[3:37:31] <tusk102> yes, you said it while playing re 1
[3:37:31] <Huntercd> Sex slave jill

[3:37:34] <rytisone> Nemesis is in ORC. So you have to play it
[3:37:35] <%SirGO0SE> jill gave you hat fetish, ada gave me bitchy asian fetish
[3:37:36] <%lionandfox21> Jill and Claire are my faves in the series
[3:37:38] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Most fetishes gotta start somewhere.
[3:37:38] <%nofestu2> You said this earlier
[3:37:41] <cesare92x> love for berets or all types of hats
[3:37:44] <FirearmsInstructor> .... god damnit he didn't take the bait :P
[3:37:49] <ECRead> would RE5 coop with Pat and Paige be the best or the worst?
[3:37:53] <SirBrawler18> I miss Jill's beret
[3:37:58] <Zaphire_Saucypants> use it
[3:37:58] <KeiPrime> borst
[3:38:06] <+DashXero> Sheva and Ada are my favorites.
[3:38:09] <%WhereIsWill> it all boils down to a beret
[3:38:11] <ECRead> I accept borst
[3:38:12] <%ssjklyco> Whats the tiniest hat you've seen
[3:38:17] <%XeroSigmaPrime> If we get an RE1 costume in 3make, easy GOTY
[3:38:23] <Zaphire_Saucypants> after
[3:38:26] <+CaptainPyron> But everyone loves blonde Jill in a cat suit. Kappa
[3:38:31] <%WarlockaFlocka> WarlockaFlocka subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! Girls with hats make the peepee fat
[3:38:32] <%Wrashis> @ECRead itd be the best for us but pat would actually die live on strem
[3:38:34] <%FacetiousAF> i had points to waste, i hope you're still finding a way to enjoy this thing
[3:38:34] <%lionandfox21> @XeroSigmaPrime You right
[3:38:35] <rcand9> hes sneaky like that
[3:38:41] <Huntercd> Tiny tie and tiny garrison cap for Cammy wuff wuff
[3:38:44] <KeiPrime> the real question is will there be a Regina outfit in 3make
[3:38:48] <%Laecerelius> Pat would love PSO2 because you could give your anime waifu MANY tiny hats
[3:38:49] <%WhereIsWill> they'd be crazy to not put that in
[3:38:51] <rytisone> fake loading door
[3:38:52] <+conradical> they'll probably do the retro costumes like they did for re2r
[3:38:53] <lightsout177> NO FLUTE??
[3:38:54] <simifu> just give jill her tired dark eyes back and ill forgive the redesign
[3:38:56] <rcand9> plz be an unlock not dlc
[3:38:56] <%natebud> hats are like costumes
[3:38:58] <%FacetiousAF> "girls look cute in tiny hats" - a wise man
[3:38:58] <%ssjklyco> you meant hat
[3:38:59] <FirearmsInstructor> Accidentally misspoke
[3:39:07] <arkv01> you said neither, you just whispered "billy"
[3:39:07] <%tiaramaki> Just slap the beret on Jill and call it a day
[3:39:07] <+Arsimckhoi> name a bad resident evil game... GO!
[3:39:09] <%TheSphereHunter> I like switching from a high energy streamer to this and just seeing Tired-AF Pat sitting there in silence
[3:39:10] <%SirGO0SE> Floot doot MIA
[3:39:15] <%lionandfox21> Or maybe doing the boutique thing again and we can get the variety!

[3:39:27] <%FacetiousAF> which one was on the Wii?
[3:39:28] <FirearmsInstructor> DEAD SURVIVOR
[3:39:29] <+ultimafullmetal> RE1 hat lands on her head in a cutscene, Jill says "not in a million years" and takes it off.
[3:39:29] <%EndlessScrapper> It was REmake that made me realize I like women in uniform

[3:39:47] <kurejichi> DEAD AIM isn't bad!
[3:39:49] <%honeyman18> I know the bad movies had a slot machine
[3:39:49] <%stevesekai> Gaiden is a masterpiece though
[3:39:52] <simifu> umbrella chronicles is decent
[3:39:56] <%lionandfox21> maybe?
[3:39:56] <%GalacticaPhanto> Dead Aim sucks but that Shinkiro art is TOP NOTCH
[3:39:57] <%SirGO0SE> thats the real questions artists ask themselves pat
[3:40:02] <%Wrashis> gun aim dead survivor outbreak gaiden file 2
[3:40:03] <Fujiwara_92> OPERATION GUN SURVIVOR
[3:40:04] <%Shadowpint> Dead Aim looks like a bad indie shooter you'd find on Steam
[3:40:05] <Zaphire_Saucypants> gotta unlock da cage door
[3:40:07] <%FacetiousAF> honestly i think RE and railgun arcadey shooter sound good on paper
[3:40:11] <Huntercd> TG virus tho Futanari Tyrants
[3:40:12] <%WhereIsWill> outbreak is better than re4 don't @ me
[3:40:14] <+BisoromiBear> autopilot disengaged
[3:40:18] <CursedNobleman> outbreak had a great idea tho LUL
[3:40:19] <%TheSphereHunter> It's great I actually love it
[3:40:21] <+LegendaryDorkKnight> !uptim
[3:40:26] <arkv01> just treat it like a speedrun
[3:40:27] <SirBrawler18> This isnt good, but I like it more than other games. It looks good and Ienjoyed the train sequence and Leechman is pretty cool
[3:40:27] <ElenaManetta> dont die
[3:40:33] <ElenaManetta> the schedule!
[3:40:34] <rcand9> high energy pat would be weird
[3:40:36] <FirearmsInstructor> Is that an explosive red cylinder beside that door in the corner that you can shoot?? (In the hallway)
[3:40:38] <%natebud> This is a travesty, the state of this man.
[3:40:40] <ECRead> Futa Tyrants you say?
[3:40:41] <%lionandfox21> Dude I played Dead Aim as a kid and I only finished it out of spite
[3:40:43] <armandolorian> make Paige play as Sheva when you play RE5 @angriestpat
[3:40:43] <+RowenCleric> outbreak games are still pretty darn good single player too
[3:40:43] <%TheSphereHunter> RE0 Slow runs
[3:40:45] <%stevesekai> @AngriestPat would you be OK with a gaiden remake to get the two best characters interact?
[3:40:48] <%Shadicara> Imagine having more energy playing temtem
[3:40:52] <%ssjklyco> you know what would be great as DLC? RE3 original voice track
[3:40:53] <%moranprime> Good Games Done Slow
[3:40:54] <+LegendaryDorkKnight> !uptime
[3:40:55] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 40m.
[3:41:00] <rytisone> RE0 no damage speedrun
[3:41:02] <+arancet> yeah but thats all speed runs
[3:41:03] <%leinadtonu> RE 0 no runs
[3:41:06] <%lionandfox21> Who would have the tolerance?
[3:41:07] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat yeah it's don't get hit, get key items, FUCKING GO
[3:41:07] <arkv01> yeah, barebones tech
[3:41:08] <+Press_X_ToJASON> thats every RE speedrun
[3:41:08] <ElenaManetta> Those speedrunners are insane though. Like, speedrunners know the exact angle of degree to stand out in order to achieve perfect projectile hit on enemies.
[3:41:09] <%Tracazoid> They do a lot of Rebecca staying by a door, swapping so she can make a quick exit.
[3:41:10] <rcand9> you have to pick up so may th0
[3:41:18] <%GalacticaPhanto> I really like Gaiden's music. that's literally about it
[3:41:19] <ElenaManetta> It's never strategy so much as INSANITY
[3:41:24] <CurrySauseBandit> Probably some unlimited inventory bug LUL
[3:41:29] <%Tearonex> @AngriestPat Welcome to Shitty Games Done Slow
[3:41:31] <morcego_cinzento_arts> honestly for Jill besides her alternative classic RE3 outfit. i hope they give us the RE1, Revelations and RE5(lost in nightmares) outfits. It was a damned shame that in the RE@ remake we didn't get RE4 leon costume and CVX claire costume(CVX is trash but that was a god claire design)
[3:41:34] <Sapphire_Breeze> @AngriestPat any% world record is 1h 16m
[3:41:44] <CursedNobleman> i love these matter transporter lockers LUL
[3:41:44] <arkv01> @Sapphire_Breeze whoa
[3:41:46] <%Faustgesicht> WR is appearantly 1h 16 minutes
[3:41:47] <Shwepie> But Pat! My goblins say I need all the items and that I can't use them!
[3:41:47] <%SirGO0SE> the only mods are no doors and wet becky lmao
[3:41:50] <ElenaManetta> Why not a mod that expands your inventory instead
[3:41:52] <ElenaManetta> Wouldn't that be easier
[3:42:01] <+LegendaryDorkKnight> maybe code veronika remake Pog ?
[3:42:01] <%lionandfox21> Hot idea, maybe have RE0 remake become a DLC for RE3 remake instead of a full game? that would be interesting
[3:42:05] <rcand9> becky give
[3:42:06] <Guardiansaiyan> @ElenaManetta cheating
[3:42:09] <chronoxgp> have every spot on floor be a item box
[3:42:10] <rytisone> Attache Case HD
[3:42:12] <simifu> @AngriestPat What if RE:0 was character chapter based Instead of the Rebecca and billy show? I wished we also played more of bravo team.
[3:42:15] <Sapphire_Breeze> @arkv01 huh, apparently that world record is also only 4 days old
[3:42:15] <%TheSphereHunter> I feel like every major type writer area in this game has a place where an Item Box used to be
[3:42:20] <%reycharles75> box better
[3:42:22] <%ssjklyco> and make weapons not take two slots
[3:42:30] <%EndlessScrapper> In Outbreak 1 the first scenario has you face off against a massive horde of zombies as you try to reach a detonator to blow them all up. You can be the big brave hero...or go back to the armored truck that dropped you off and just drive around. This ending I always found hilarious.
[3:42:31] <%natebud> Changing an inventory value would be easy, altering the UI might take some work
[3:42:32] <+LegendaryDorkKnight> haha bad game

[3:42:41] <devanmuse> Did you remember to get all the chemicals this time? Lest you have to run back to the mansion
[3:42:42] <the_millenial_falcon> I wonder if an itembox mod would require much rebalancing because I've always wanted one too.

[3:43:59] <ElenaManetta> fist pump!
[3:43:59] <+DashXero> 'Guess they call it the "Breeding Room" because somebody's gotta get fucked there....
[3:44:02] <%asgard147> quiettNoice quiettEvil

[3:44:11] <%solidousstream> apatGib apatGib apatGib apatGib apatGib
[3:44:13] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> @angriestpat wherea your healing items?
[3:44:25] <KeiPrime> some medic
[3:44:25] <%WhereIsWill> STUNLOCKED
[3:44:26] <$RealThiele> bileeee
[3:44:27] <%TheSphereHunter> that's hit animation delay
[3:44:34] <simifu> hunter are cunts man, hopefully they are also cunts in re3
[3:44:34] <Virgil_Valentine> Luckily those hunters let you read
[3:44:36] <Zaphire_Saucypants> 4863
[3:44:36] <%solidousstream> @thatoneguyyousaw health items are useless
[3:44:37] <%natebud> Billy has a full heal on his floor at least
[3:44:37] <%tiaramaki> I'm more surprised that Becky didn't get decap'd tho
[3:44:38] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Got corner fuckered there buddy
[3:44:39] <%moranprime> Hunter wombo combo
[3:44:43] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @lionandfox21 lol
[3:44:48] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat What's worse? Hit stun chain damage, or cut-scene damage?
[3:44:49] <+LegendaryDorkKnight> Hoonters
[3:44:51] <CurrySauseBandit> Like 9 hits to kill you though. They need the handicap.
[3:44:52] <cesare92x> hunters are created tho... and they re in a breeding room... so they fuck? hunters woman and Hunter man
[3:44:53] <rcand9> thats why i send billy up
[3:44:53] <Clu_Flynn> rawrThink rawrThink rawrThink rawrThink rawrThink rawrThink rawrThink rawrThink rawrThink rawrThink rawrThink rawrThink rawrThink rawrThink rawrThink
[3:45:00] <42nfl19> @AngriestPat What percent are you at? maybe the last quarter at least?
[3:45:02] <%moranprime> Good thing it didn't behead you while in hit stun :( that'd be cheap
[3:45:02] <rcand9> for that room
[3:45:05] <%rumtumtugnutz> Only noobs use heals.
[3:45:09] <%TheSphereHunter> you can shoot a hunter with a shotgun as it's attacking and it'll still hit you while also falling to the ground
[3:45:14] <$GameOverDeo> Pat keep saying that don't bring any healing items in any RE game which only works if you have certain mastery of that game
[3:45:17] <%D3rrtyD4n> evo19MindBlown wat
[3:45:18] <42nfl19> oh...
[3:45:20] <Huntercd> Human embryo and frog with virus gets Hunters
[3:45:20] <+chunkymonkey737> beam me up......billy
[3:45:23] <%Shadicara> They just wanted to breed pat apatBougie
[3:45:25] <%stevesekai> That's awful
[3:45:28] <rcand9> haha
[3:45:33] <%Aydarkzero> clearly that means the Hunter landed on you causing damage Kappa
[3:45:39] <%natebud> Those hunters are awful talented
[3:45:39] <$RealThiele> battletoads operate at a different fps cause rare
[3:45:39] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Wasn't there a DELAY in when you hit, and when it responds, and can STILL hurt you??
[3:45:43] <FirearmsInstructor> yeah
[3:45:43] <simifu> Thats why terragresia from revelations should be fucked (and it was) cause of all the hunters that got loose.
[3:45:43] <%kingbaconcrispy> You also have alot of hit stun
[3:45:44] <%Aydarkzero> that's dumb
[3:45:51] <+LegendaryDorkKnight> isnt this the same engine as remake tho?
[3:45:51] <spacecatstreams> ah its pat! my favorite artist.
[3:46:03] <%natebud> Is that only a problem in the HD version?
[3:46:03] <ShibuyaTomato> @GameOverDeo nah that's solid advice; you don't want to have healing items taking up space when you find another healing item
[3:46:13] <%Shadowpint> Heal poor Becky ;w;
[3:46:16] <+LegendaryDorkKnight> ohh okay
[3:46:16] <%stevesekai> Terragregia can't handle the hit delay
[3:46:18] <+RETROxRELOADED> ha.. delay
[3:46:22] <%EndlessScrapper> Freaking cutscene damage. I remember in Crono Trigger you can beat the big bads robot in the future in new game+. Then the robot just gets back up and tpk you while the game tells you "Cant continue the story unless you get captured"
[3:46:25] <antyriku2> Hi pat i have arrived
[3:46:27] <Arek_1> 1 second hyper armor. LUL
[3:46:27] <%D3rrtyD4n> i hate this buddy system
[3:46:27] <rcand9> your not many play testers idea definitely seems right
[3:46:29] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Shut up. You put becky in the corner while billee pushed a box!
[3:46:30] <%SirGO0SE> For the time, the AI on the partner was miles better than anything else in existence
[3:46:31] <ElenaManetta> See? You DO have an item box. One with legs!
[3:46:42] <Octocon> you can control the other char with the right analog stick @AngriestPat
[3:46:50] <%solidousstream> you're right @angriestpat billie is a shit item box
[3:46:59] <%natebud> Who's a better character? Rebecca or Ethan's backpack?
[3:47:01] <Huntercd> Did Mikami work on this?
[3:47:01] <the_millenial_falcon> I would make an itembox mod for this but they are all dark souls mimics.
[3:47:02] <$RealThiele> why hire big team when small team make game
[3:47:04] <%lionandfox21> Think the effort was basically given to RE4?
[3:47:05] <ElenaManetta> Well even if they did, play testers don't decide on quality, right?
[3:47:07] <%D3rrtyD4n> NILLY
[3:47:10] <arkv01> no time, billy had to be exposed to the world ASAP
[3:47:10] <%D3rrtyD4n> BILLY*
[3:47:11] <TomFrank> WHO ELSE WOULD IT BE?
[3:47:12] <lloyddboy> BEELE
[3:47:13] <%D3rrtyD4n> he said it
[3:47:13] <+LegendaryDorkKnight> Hey Rebecaa
[3:47:17] <%LaughingCatt> Bili
[3:47:19] <ElenaManetta> Like, they can't demand full gameplay changes that require months to redo, I don't think.
[3:47:21] <FirearmsInstructor> BILL EE
[3:47:23] <%tiaramaki> BILL-EE
[3:47:26] <%nofestu2> billah
[3:47:27] <simifu> RE 2 time yet?
[3:47:30] <%Laecerelius> Now we can go to the NEXT infested mansion!
[3:47:31] <rytisone> later
[3:47:32] <Sapphire_Breeze> later
[3:47:35] <%TheSphereHunter> Of course, and most of it comes off of this game being a N64 game that got shelved. Like, Eliminators sometimes just tank through shots, not in a "I polished this game type of way" but in a "this shit is bugged type of way" it looks bad.
[3:47:35] <%natebud> not quite
[3:47:38] <%lionandfox21> He gets attacked in a bit
[3:47:42] <Zaphire_Saucypants> after you go for the cable car door
[3:47:43] <cesare92x> a cable car... here? Leon RE2remake
[3:47:45] <+reknownblackcat> have you played as Byliiee in Smash Zero?
[3:47:53] <simifu> sorry, RE 2 cock tease time yet?
[3:47:54] <%snow_bush> This or hunting Paolamu multiple times, which is worse?
[3:47:56] <King_Wolf_Rigger> This was gonna be an N64 game? Holy shit
[3:47:57] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @cesare92x I believe that hunters are created by using the T-virus as a bonding agent to fuse the DNA of humans and lizards, and then that fertilized egg is developed in seregate mothers
[3:47:58] <FirearmsInstructor> @TheSphereHunter wait this is N64?
[3:47:59] <Octocon> so your wrong pat, you can control both chars sbfpPat
[3:48:01] <+LegendaryDorkKnight> Billeh
[3:48:09] <%Laecerelius> Yeah it was originally made for the N64
[3:48:19] <TalisKanju> The game was originally developed for the N64
[3:48:27] <FirearmsInstructor> wow
[3:48:29] <%moranprime> @King_Wolf_Rigger It looked like RE2 on the N64 before they said heck with it and put it on the Gamecube
[3:48:30] <KeiPrime> theres like a handful of n64 screenshots floatin around
[3:48:30] <%stevesekai> Is Billy Nemesis? I remember hearing something like that once but I'm don't think that was ever confirmed
[3:48:31] <%Shadicara> What LUL
[3:48:32] <%natebud> Makes sense
[3:48:35] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Huh
[3:48:35] <%SirGO0SE> i dint know that
[3:48:37] <simifu> well yeah...so was mother 3
[3:48:38] <the_millenial_falcon> Yeah, you can find test play footage of it.
[3:48:40] <+LegendaryDorkKnight> Nintend OMEGALUL
[3:48:43] <%spiritofmojave> That is something else... more ya know
[3:48:44] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @moranprime That's wild.
[3:48:45] <%moranprime> @stevesekai Only because they both say Stars funny lol
[3:48:45] <%lionandfox21> @FirearmsInstructor yeah and it was suppose to be a Dreamcast game too at some point too I think?
[3:48:48] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Wait does this have a graphics update? It looks WAY too good for N64
[3:48:49] <%rumtumtugnutz> Testers would have sent that back as an unintended feature for sure.
[3:48:52] <BurdRightsActivist> @simifu Earthbound is lame anyways 4Head
[3:48:53] <yficaptions> gosh dang those background look great
[3:48:54] <%stevesekai> Ah the STARS connection
[3:48:55] <ElenaManetta> WRONG LEVER!!!!
[3:48:55] <%Shadowpint> I wonder what the game would've been like on the N64. Same thing but worse?
[3:48:59] <%WhereIsWill> that explains the controls
[3:49:01] <rcand9> remake is such a good game
[3:49:03] <FirearmsInstructor> @lionandfox21 damn
[3:49:06] <TalisKanju> They decided not to shelve it and unfortunately released it for the Gamecube
[3:49:08] <%stevesekai> I still hope Billy's alive and comes back
[3:49:15] <+RETROxRELOADED> a whinnied turd is still a turd
[3:49:17] <cesare92x> I hope R3make is as close as possible to a sandbox raccoon city
[3:49:19] <simifu> @BurdRightsActivist might be right about earthbound, but mother 3 is way better TriHard
[3:49:19] <%rumtumtugnutz> This might have been OK on 64
[3:49:21] <%nofestu2> what do ya think of it?
[3:49:22] <Zaphire_Saucypants> you wont activate an enemy
[3:49:24] <%EndlessScrapper> How do you market Hunters? "Here are humanoid monsters you can unleash on your enemies!" "Cool. How do I call them back when they finish killing everyone?" "....You wanted to call them back?"
[3:49:27] <FirearmsInstructor> Holy shit this was released in 2002!?
[3:49:29] <%lionandfox21> Gotta reunite them Pat for the scene to trigger
[3:49:31] <%InugamiTheHound> becky needs food badly
[3:49:33] <%SirGO0SE> Again a reminder: This game was INCREDIBLY well received at the time of release. 85 metacritic.
[3:49:35] <Zaphire_Saucypants> not with THAT at least
[3:49:35] <%lionandfox21> HEAL HER
[3:49:37] <ElenaManetta> I want a cute piggyback feature
[3:49:37] <arkv01> billy comes back in RE8 guns abazling only to die 5 minutes later forshock value apatWink
[3:49:39] <%TheSphereHunter> For those of you who haven't seen it, there's actually a lot of train footage of the N64 version of this game, it looks really interesting. You get to see an RE2 looking Billy model.
[3:49:42] <ElenaManetta> this game sucks for shippers
[3:49:43] <%moranprime> I remember people on Gamefaqs also tried to say the hand with the handcuffs in the opening of RE1 was Billy's hand LUL
[3:49:44] <%stevesekai> BECKY EAT THE WEED
[3:49:53] <%tank7013> @EndlessScrapper I guess that's what the anti-BOW gas is for
[3:49:53] <%kingbaconcrispy> Wait for the winter to kill the hunters.
[3:50:00] <ElenaManetta> You should be able to heal each other like in Kirby Allies by making out
[3:50:01] <+LegendaryDorkKnight> I think you can control 2nd char with the c stick on gamecube
[3:50:01] <TalisKanju> I hope they don't get rid of those narrow walkways in RE3 remake
[3:50:02] <%stevesekai> RE2 Billy sounds hot af
[3:50:09] <%natebud> hey pat have you though about healing rebecca? Asking for a friend in chat
[3:50:10] <cesare92x> I hope R3make is as close as possible to a sandbox style game
[3:50:13] <%stevesekai> Those polygon pecks
[3:50:16] <KeiPrime> the idea of BOWs used in actual combat is kinda ridic, i think one of the CG movies shows it in action
[3:50:16] <%lionandfox21> @TheSphereHunter I didn't know that there was footage, that's super cool thank you!
[3:50:17] <%Aydarkzero> don't think i ever saw the n64 gameplay i think i saw something from an interview once
[3:50:21] <%doc_ock_rokc> Smells like someone downstairs is smoking some Green herb
[3:50:22] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @kingbaconcrispy Weren't we supposed to send in the horses first?
[3:50:26] <KeiPrime> tyrant vs tank
[3:50:30] <FirearmsInstructor> I'm actually getting super upset that everyone's calling her "Becky" and even MORE upset because I don't know why I'm having this response. LUL
[3:50:31] <%Laecerelius> BECKY SMASH! MAKE GOOD HEAL! BECKY SMART!
[3:50:32] <simifu> BOO BRING BACK FIXED CAMERA ANGLES FOR REMAKES Kappa
[3:50:33] <%Aydarkzero> Tank wins Kappa
[3:50:35] <the_millenial_falcon> low rez tribal tats
[3:50:37] <ElenaManetta> Press your 3D model against my 3D model and increase my green bar
[3:50:40] <BurdRightsActivist> Just a thought, have you ever considered healing Rebecca? Asking for a friend btw 4Head
[3:50:45] <+twin_triggers> ooof max is on
[3:50:46] <rcand9> this section still has some shit up its sleeve
[3:50:47] <+LegendaryDorkKnight> Becky get Huge
[3:50:53] <%kingbaconcrispy> @King_Wolf_Rigger No no no, the rabbid attack dogs with bees coming out of their mouth.
[3:50:53] <+FrenchTact1cs> #Ryona
[3:50:56] <%TheSphereHunter> INVENTORY!!!!
[3:50:59] <%Binary_Fireball> i wonder how far you could push pre rendered backgrounds with today's graphics
[3:51:02] <+RETROxRELOADED> plump britches
[3:51:04] <arkv01> I think I'd actually prefer the n64 aesthetic for this game
[3:51:06] <%WhereIsWill> pats sighs of pain give me life LUL
[3:51:09] <FirearmsInstructor> I think the level of dumb is just overwhelming me LUL
[3:51:09] <%Binary_Fireball> I bet it's pretty far
[3:51:10] <Fujiwara_92> attache case redux
[3:51:13] <%D3rrtyD4n> goblins defeated
[3:51:13] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @FirearmsInstructor It's like how Bill is short for William. Becky is short for Rebecca.
[3:51:13] <%Aydarkzero> just manage your inventory better 4Head
[3:51:18] <%Shadicara> apatBougie
[3:51:19] <%natebud> And you didn't need a single item from the observatory
[3:51:23] <%stevesekai> Rev 3 but it's Billy and Becky again and you don't have an item box
[3:51:25] <arkv01> we... we billy!
[3:51:27] <FirearmsInstructor> @King_Wolf_Rigger I know that's why I'm confused
[3:51:29] <%SirGO0SE> @Binary_Fireball ive made photorealistic rooms lol
[3:51:30] <tusk102> @AngriestPat you're about to be seperated again Kappa
[3:51:31] <TalisKanju> I want to see a supercut of all the times Inventory problems are brought up
[3:51:33] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @kingbaconcrispy Ah yes, of course. I forgot that part.
[3:51:36] <+LegendaryDorkKnight> funny how coop works in re5 and 6 but in 0 its trash KEKW
[3:51:37] <FirearmsInstructor> @King_Wolf_Rigger
[3:51:38] <rcand9> recommend a save just incase for inventory snaffus
[3:51:38] <iWBstovetop> That’s a lot of ammo....in the chamber
[3:51:39] <Cosairen> WOLF FORCE
[3:51:42] <ElenaManetta> I didn't quite notice it, but after Pat's done like 5 pick up items in a row, I hate the rapid fast "zooming towards the camera in a spinning action at 3 frames" animation the items do when you pick em up
[3:51:43] <%lionandfox21> It is short tho
[3:51:44] <%nofestu2> THIS part?
[3:51:47] <simifu> but re 2 labs and proto tyrant
[3:51:48] <BurdRightsActivist> @Binary_Fireball Eh probably not in a AAA title.
[3:51:50] <%Binary_Fireball> that's dope @sirgo0se
[3:51:50] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Is that red tank shootable?? In the corner in hall on previous screen
[3:51:51] <ShibuyaTomato> i always wanted a re starring billy and sheva
[3:51:51] <Fujiwara_92> yeah, I'd save about now
[3:51:52] <%natebud> half of the playtime was spent at a dumbwaiter
[3:51:54] <cesare92x> hope R3make is like a sandbox, let you explore all raccoon city
[3:51:55] <%Chatterbox1991> @AngriestPat Would you want a remake of RE0 done in the style of RE2make ir RE3make?
[3:51:56] <ElenaManetta> NOW
[3:52:03] <+Jokobeast> Even with two of you, that seems like an aggressively small inventory space.
[3:52:03] <Zaphire_Saucypants> save after you've activated teh car
[3:52:08] <filialpails> sounds... dangeresque
[3:52:10] <Zaphire_Saucypants> but dont open the doors
[3:52:13] <yficaptions> This part meaning RE 0 Kappa
[3:52:19] <%lionandfox21> Doesn't this trigger the scene?
[3:52:26] <%moranprime> I'd rather Capcom make RE8 now lol
[3:52:33] <%natebud> You know what must be done
[3:52:36] <+RETROxRELOADED> I a scared
[3:52:36] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Chatterbox1991 What?!
[3:52:38] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @FirearmsInstructor Look, if you knew everything about yourself, wouldn't you just be a perfect being? It's that confused anger that makes you human lol.
[3:52:38] <simifu> BRing back eliminators for re 3 remake Kappa
[3:52:39] <Zaphire_Saucypants> mhm
[3:52:39] <TalisKanju> I'd rather see a remake of CVX
[3:52:41] <FirearmsInstructor> Wait do you need the.... OMG
[3:52:42] <MachineHead9> LUL
[3:52:45] <%ssjklyco> RE0 might be best remade in style of Revelations 2
[3:52:47] <ElenaManetta> huh what was that? you LOVE it???
[3:52:47] <%tank7013> @stevesekai Imagine Rev 3 having 2 teams like Rev 2 but it's Billy/Becky and Sheva/Carlos
[3:52:48] <%TheSphereHunter> :D
[3:52:48] <Zaphire_Saucypants> yup was bout to say
[3:52:49] <+LegendaryDorkKnight> Grapple gun Pog
[3:52:51] <the_millenial_falcon> The magic turbolift elevator in this game is really dumb
[3:52:53] <+RowenCleric> its ok we hate it too
[3:52:55] <%Laecerelius> GRAPPLE GUUUUUUUUUUUN!!!!
[3:52:57] <Fujiwara_92> monkaS
[3:53:01] <Ran196> RE0 was made just to make Pat suffer
[3:53:03] <Zaphire_Saucypants> it haunts you for the whole fuckin game
[3:53:05] <TomFrank> but its cool like batman
[3:53:07] <%kingbaconcrispy> @King_Wolf_Rigger Pat wants to transcend is humanity and become a pillar toilet
[3:53:09] <+keyoray> sending pat love <3
[3:53:09] <%stevesekai> @tank7013 Yes. But still no item box
[3:53:10] <%lionandfox21> @moranprime Some one leaked that the game is currently in development but was pushed back by the popularity of RE2 remake and RE3 remake
[3:53:11] <arkv01> @TalisKanju I too would also rather see HD incest
[3:53:13] <rcand9> hookshot more like fuckshot that
[3:53:13] <%Chatterbox1991> Worse than the TMP?
[3:53:15] <rytisone> grapple away
[3:53:18] <%natebud> Hate is valid

[3:53:21] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I think so, ye
[3:53:22] <%luftraumm1> eurogamer seems to have put out news regarding a leak concerning re8 not necessarily being a numbered installment
[3:53:22] <%TheSphereHunter> Yea after this room drop that shit FOREVER!
[3:53:23] <@commanderclaw> It's highly inconvenient and annoying

[3:53:31] <%lionandfox21> Burn at the stake
[3:53:33] <morcego_cinzento_arts> honestly i think that the only possibly sucessfel usage of those b.o.w's for modern combat would be the mr.x tyrants(including nemesis). If you manage them to not grow super long claws, i do imagine that they can use weapons(based on the original RE2 concept art of MR X holding a grenade launcher). i do imagine that since MR.X is strong enough to punch through concrete,they can like carry a ton of body armour and use guns no problem. They could be quite good for high risk missions
[3:53:34] <%Binary_Fireball> @angriestpat just do a no item run... dih

[3:54:10] <TriadOrion> Honestly, if everything in this damn game was one inventory slot it would be a lot better
[3:54:11] <Fujiwara_92> BIG IF, BIGGEST IF IN THE WORLD
[3:54:12] <simifu> 2 slots make that item UGHHHH
[3:54:13] <%SirGO0SE> eah ffffff
[3:54:15] <@commanderclaw> Or it could just be like the lighter and not take up a slot
[3:54:16] <the_millenial_falcon> I forget, does this game tell you that it's okay to discard items?
[3:54:16] <Guardiansaiyan> thinks IF we had better inventory this might not happun
[3:54:17] <%Laecerelius> Pat's hate for grapple gun is so large his brain can't word
[3:54:17] <%EndlessScrapper> In fact almost all of Umbrella's creations are only good for unleashing on a enemy once. Yeah they be useful in terror attacks but the goal of most armies and warlords is to control the land your killing people for. How do you rule a land populated by monsters that don't respond to your commands? That was the purpose of the Tyrant but it also failed.
[3:54:18] <%natebud> Don't be a grappeling hook apologist pat, it just sucks @AngriestPat
[3:54:20] <%D3rrtyD4n> or just not have it take up space like chris's lighter
[3:54:24] <%stevesekai> This whole game is just IF...

[3:54:41] <Guardiansaiyan> no
[3:54:46] <%TheSphereHunter> Yea honestly it should've been Billy's permanent starting item, who cares if doesn't make sense
[3:54:47] <%WackyXmand> If i buy fast food a disguise it as my own cooking?
[3:54:49] <%rumtumtugnutz> Now we need an IF emote
[3:54:51] <Zaphire_Saucypants> bye bye hookshot
[3:54:56] <%lionandfox21> @moranprime me too, though they're probably waiting for the next gen to REALLY go for it
[3:54:57] <%natebud> I want Ark Thompson to be the hero of RE8
[3:54:58] <ElenaManetta> All the backtracking is making me focus on tiny details like... Why do the characters "camera" stare at the doorknob during animations and then look up as they open it. Thats not how you open a door.
[3:54:58] <%stevesekai> Billy has grapple

[3:55:17] <%SirGO0SE> i miss floot
[3:55:18] <@commanderclaw> He breaks out of the cuffs and finds a grappling hook
[3:55:20] <TalisKanju> Ark Thompson surely has more children to save.
[3:55:24] <King_Wolf_Rigger> OR, it should've been Becky's, and everyone could just combine herbs and shit.

[3:59:44] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Where's flute man?
[3:59:49] <%tiaramaki> Ouchie-ouch-ouch!
[3:59:49] <%kingbaconcrispy> Yeah torching him works to.
[3:59:50] <%natebud> yup
[3:59:52] <%Aydarkzero> why did it look like that leech phased through the floor?
[3:59:53] <%Laecerelius> I know, right?!
[3:59:53] <the_millenial_falcon> He was weak because he had no flute
[3:59:54] <cesare92x> imagine leaving all the weapons to Billy now, leaving the other handgun in the hall, and fighting prototyrant with just the magnum
[3:59:54] <%Binary_Fireball> didn't juke
[3:59:55] <%waltzqueen> Three Ow
[3:59:55] <%ssjklyco> he tried to put one in Becky's Chambers
[3:59:55] <SchroedingersFerret> OIW
[3:59:58] <Zaphire_Saucypants> no flute for you
[4:00:01] <simifu> Guys I just fell off a cliff and all i said was "ow" Kappa
[4:00:01] <%Binary_Fireball> why no juke
[4:00:02] <Fujiwara_92> flute man die
[4:00:04] <TalisKanju> Ou-ouch.
[4:00:05] <ElenaManetta> Chat was making fun of the flute too much so it left.
[4:00:09] <zenith0111> atpFeelsBeardMan
[4:00:09] <arkv01> the real flute were the friends we made along the way
[4:00:12] <filialpails> why so little noise made from flute now?
[4:00:12] <KaliasTV> Billy plays the flute but he fell in a hole
[4:00:14] <TalisKanju> This game has terrible demons.
[4:00:18] <Zaphire_Saucypants> yup
[4:00:22] <FirearmsInstructor> Becky couldn't hear it because her ears were still ringing from the eliminator's Alpha-ass-slap.
[4:00:24] <morcego_cinzento_arts> i kinda want to replace all RE characters scream of pain for Mike's(RLM) shout of "oh fuck!"
[4:00:24] <%stevesekai> IDK why I remembered this but the best cheat code in any game was Bionicle Heroes on the DS where you could change all the sound effects to just some dude making the sounds
[4:00:24] <jamesofn> if only you had some sort of box
[4:00:25] <causewaybob> Dear diary ouch
[4:00:27] <rcand9> fire rounds are the best rounds because of leeches
[4:00:27] <+Jokobeast> @TalisKanju O U C H
[4:00:29] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Was Billy the flute man all along?
[4:00:31] <OswaldTheDog> o u ch
[4:00:36] <TomFrank> YOU GET 6
[4:00:40] <TalisKanju> It's dumb that the SHOTGUN takes two slots.
[4:00:43] <%doc_ock_rokc> So have anyone here cannonally catch the corrnavirus....or t virus....same thing
[4:00:45] <simifu> Try real survival mode on REMAKE and then you can whine about it Kappa
[4:00:45] <OswaldTheDog> pat needs a break after this shit lmao
[4:00:48] <%natebud> Should have left the launcher with Billy. his unconscious body would have been your item box.
[4:00:48] <%SirGO0SE> becky bockz
[4:00:50] <%stevesekai> Billy Box and Becky Box
[4:00:51] <ElenaManetta> transdimensional boxes break immersion
[4:00:51] <ShibuyaTomato> what kind of box pat?
[4:00:56] <zenith0111> Da fucks a box? doodCap
[4:00:57] <+corrosivePaladin> you do have a box. it even has a hat
[4:00:57] <%spiritofmojave> If only there was a... case of some type?
[4:00:57] <Fujiwara_92> a box? what are you insane
[4:01:00] <%moranprime> Too hard to code
[4:01:01] <+ahdurian> just use Rebecca's "box"
[4:01:01] <%TheSphereHunter> get ready to carry around ANOTHER WEAPON
[4:01:01] <Zaphire_Saucypants> That's CRAZY, Pat.
[4:01:03] <ElenaManetta> instead putting down objects and picking up them later via backtracking is better
[4:01:05] <+Jokobeast> Just a box.
[4:01:05] <yficaptions> at least it's all uphill from here right LUL
[4:01:06] <rcand9> capcom hello
[4:01:06] <+RaziWraith> A ohnBox for items?
[4:01:08] <+YungDaf0e> this game aight, it would be better with an item box
[4:01:12] <causewaybob> Why is pat playing as a backpack?
[4:01:13] <%natebud> We warned him. Don't say we didn't warn him
[4:01:13] <FirearmsInstructor> @TheSphereHunter What are your top / favorite and bottom / least favorite RE games?
[4:01:15] <rcand9> make a damn box
[4:01:17] <%Aydarkzero> imagine being prepared in Resident Evil 0 Kappa
[4:01:18] <$GameOverDeo> or a pouch that increases inventory slots
[4:01:18] <%stevesekai> Box for boxes
[4:01:20] <%unclekulikov> Don't be ridiculous - Fallout 76 showed such technology is years away!
[4:01:21] <Zaphire_Saucypants> magnuuuum
[4:01:24] <the_millenial_falcon> Boxes aren't real Pat, they've never been real
[4:01:26] <zenith0111> doodTerror
[4:01:28] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @doc_ock_rokc Maybe me. I was bedridden for nearly a week, and sick for more than a month. Still getting over something that wrecked me pretty bad.
[4:01:29] <WaxWitch> itkBOX
[4:01:31] <simifu> I had to play death stranding item moving from one box to the other on real survivor mode in remake...that is TRUE PAIN
[4:01:35] <FirearmsInstructor> @unclekulikov notkohThink
[4:01:41] <%ssjklyco> Dropping items is just the box without the menu. Think about it.
[4:01:42] <%Binary_Fireball> every room IS a giant box
[4:01:44] <%lockbreaker> !uptime
[4:01:44] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 1m.
[4:01:46] <%Binary_Fireball> like duh
[4:01:47] <rcand9> yeppers ive done that
[4:01:48] <%TheSphereHunter> I like this magnum the most I think
[4:01:51] <%Aydarkzero> it's the problem solver
[4:01:53] <rcand9> and saved bad too
[4:01:56] <%doc_ock_rokc> @King_Wolf_Rigger thats rough buddy. Wish ya luck
[4:02:01] <Zaphire_Saucypants> where'd you leave those magnum rounds? @AngriestPat
[4:02:01] <+chunkymonkey737> they can't all be winners, now can they?
[4:02:07] <FirearmsInstructor> Is this the magic elevator?
[4:02:08] <%stevesekai> The magnum is so strong it kills big monsters with one bullet
[4:02:11] <%SirGO0SE> oh did byleth come out today?
[4:02:14] <%Aydarkzero> ye
[4:02:15] <TalisKanju> Poor Billy.
[4:02:16] <%TheSphereHunter> START A NEW SAVE
[4:02:22] <BurdRightsActivist> Are we almost done this? ResidentSleeper
[4:02:23] <%natebud> That would be impossible. he doesn't have the inventory space to have all the cool items
[4:02:24] <Sapphire_Breeze> the plane tyrant DansGame
[4:02:25] <%Laecerelius> Time for mangum?
[4:02:26] <zenith0111> calebFlexL apatCanada calebFlexR
[4:02:26] <%stevesekai> Save me Becky
[4:02:26] <%EndlessScrapper> And thus Becky leaves not giving a single thought of Billy who fell over the railing
[4:02:27] <TalisKanju> That's how CVX is.
[4:02:28] <%moranprime> Narrow hallway that you can't run past him, right?
[4:02:29] <BurdRightsActivist> @SirGO0SE Byleth who?
[4:02:33] <simifu> yep and she/he is fun
[4:02:34] <FirearmsInstructor> Light the fuse to reveal the key
[4:02:35] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @doc_ock_rokc Thanks. Doing a lot better than pre-Christmas that's for sure lol.
[4:02:37] <+badjab326> they really should have given this game Sonic/Tails style co-op
[4:02:38] <FirearmsInstructor> Marshalling yard setup
[4:02:42] <%moranprime> The other is you're in that plane and you can't go back to pick up ammo
[4:02:50] <%SirGO0SE> @BurdRightsActivist p much
[4:02:54] <rcand9> billy have all the ink?
[4:03:02] <+RETROxRELOADED> MAGIC
[4:03:03] <SMuffinMan> Good thing zombies only need the knife in CV
[4:03:08] <%Aydarkzero> i think i might pass on Byleth, then again it's been a minute since i played Ultimate
[4:03:09] <%Laecerelius> Of course billy has all the ink. In his tattoo!
[4:03:10] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat Howdy dude. How goes the Aree Zero?
[4:03:11] <%TheSphereHunter> I honestly thought you just used that R/G mix with full health I almost had a panic attack
[4:03:11] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @TheSphereHunter I used to prefer the RE2 Leon's desert Eagle but eventually i grew to like this oversized 1911 of a magnum
[4:03:11] <FirearmsInstructor> ... what?
[4:03:14] <ElenaManetta> Billy ink drop it billy?
[4:03:14] <+ahdurian> was that english?
[4:03:14] <rcand9> good
[4:03:15] <Zaphire_Saucypants> words, what are they?
[4:03:16] <%stevesekai> Billy ink drop billy
[4:03:19] <Fujiwara_92> exactly
[4:03:19] <%SirGO0SE> Billy wear ink on sleeves
[4:03:22] <+conradical> did you just point up?
[4:03:24] <%doc_ock_rokc> @SirGO0SE Yes Generic Fire Emblem Protaginist A and B has been added to smash along with more nerfs to joker
[4:03:25] <worldbrand> That's the billy hatcher crossover with splatoon, right?
[4:03:26] <$bootysteve> billy ink drop billy
[4:03:32] <$afronooch> Billy ink drop Billy, ah yes
[4:03:34] <FirearmsInstructor> Billy?
[4:03:37] <FirearmsInstructor> Holy fuck
[4:03:39] <%TheSphereHunter> same!
[4:03:40] <Zaphire_Saucypants> understandable
[4:03:41] <%doc_ock_rokc> Nope
[4:03:41] <ElenaManetta> you keep calling the chat "billy"
[4:03:42] <%Laecerelius> Brain go down
[4:03:43] <+badjab326> best magnum is Lightning Hawk from RE5
[4:03:44] <%lionandfox21> LET ME INN
[4:03:44] <ElenaManetta> it makes me concerned
[4:03:44] <%RubberFistFight> T R U E A R T
[4:03:45] <%SirGO0SE> this is your brain on becky
[4:03:46] <%doc_ock_rokc> We can't tell pat
[4:03:48] <+ahdurian> couldnt tell. seems normal
[4:03:48] <Zaphire_Saucypants> we are ALL Billy now
[4:03:49] <%natebud> The difference here is that you have to worry about keeping both characters well equipped simultaneously, whereas CVX it's just knowing the right moment to drop all of your good weapons
[4:03:51] <causewaybob> Tattoos and backpack on another adventure
[4:03:51] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> no, you're always this dumb
[4:03:52] <%stevesekai> We've noticed
[4:03:53] <%reycharles75> it wasn't already
[4:03:53] <Fujiwara_92> PAT'S HURI
[4:03:56] <TomFrank> all of our brains are slowly dying really
[4:03:56] <cesare92x> best part ever now
[4:03:56] <+conradical> brian power go down
[4:03:56] <simifu> Omikron didnt do that, yet this game is? monkaS
[4:03:57] <Sapphire_Breeze> RE2
[4:03:57] <%honeyman18> Down a couple lobes from explosive brain cell xeath
[4:03:57] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat It's probably the cononavirus evolving to phase 2
[4:03:59] <+BisoromiBear> your brain is rejecting this kusoge
[4:03:59] <%MoulesFritz> its fine, everyones='s brains are dying
[4:03:59] <worldbrand> Seems nominal to me
[4:04:01] <Zaphire_Saucypants> We are stuck with the monkey
[4:04:01] <zenith0111> atpFeelsBeardMan atpFeelsBeardMan atpFeelsBeardMan
[4:04:01] <+chunkymonkey737> this is ALL in your head!
[4:04:02] <%RubberFistFight> @SirGO0SE I'd like to be on Becky Kappa
[4:04:04] <%moranprime> Press F for Ink Ribbons--I mean Billy
[4:04:04] <%Dragovus> In another few hours the sun will rise
[4:04:05] <%D3rrtyD4n> its all worth it to get to re6 atpRtsd
[4:04:09] <rcand9> we have reached the easier part of the game imo
[4:04:09] <Infamousxd23> It’s ok we enjoy the bumble
[4:04:11] <+keyoray> BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump
[4:04:13] <Fujiwara_92> PAT'S HURTING HIMSELF FOR HIS ART, HOW BEAUTIFUL
[4:04:13] <cesare92x> then RE2 possible remake feels from the old times
[4:04:13] <$bootysteve> beckyyyyyyy lemme smaaaaaaaaaaash
[4:04:14] <TalisKanju> This brain frying did NOT happen in CVX. Confirms RE0 as WORST GAME in the series.
[4:04:22] <%Binary_Fireball> it's not omnicron
[4:04:23] <%Aydarkzero> Pat truly is an artist
[4:04:27] <%SirGO0SE> @RubberFistFight Kreygasm
[4:04:33] <ElenaManetta> you're gonna make over ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS TONIGHT. its worth the price to sacrifice your body
[4:04:33] <%doc_ock_rokc> Its okay pat we are all slowly dying on the inside
[4:04:34] <+RETROxRELOADED> vineSchut
[4:04:34] <Sapphire_Breeze> @D3rrtyD4n RE6 hurts less if your brain is fried preemptively LUL
[4:04:34] <%ScreamLord> @AngriestPat The Hunters are just WereLizards
[4:04:35] <%waltzqueen> @AngriestPat you can do it! You can make it through
[4:04:36] <+keyoray> Suffer for your art
[4:04:38] <morcego_cinzento_arts> Also i love the magnum redesigns in RE1 remake. the colt python with the underbarrel weight, called Silver Serpent is quite awesome
[4:04:40] <rcand9> just need enough ammo for bosses
[4:04:42] <SMuffinMan> Marshalling Yard yeee
[4:04:44] <simifu> RE 2 need another remake with fixed camera angles and tank controles
[4:04:44] <+SlappyMeats> let's just tickle that RE2 feel for a minute
[4:04:45] <%silverira> Is RE0 giving Pat the LUPUS?
[4:04:49] <%Aydarkzero> ok
[4:04:50] <%moranprime> Thinking is too hard
[4:04:50] <zenith0111> doodCap : "You guys like companions?"
[4:04:53] <+SlappyMeats> yeah this is bullshit
[4:04:53] <+ahdurian> think hard? ow
[4:04:54] <+Draylle> uh huh
[4:04:55] <Zaphire_Saucypants> there's something in the cabinet
[4:04:56] <King_Wolf_Rigger> thunk
[4:04:57] <rcand9> the final boss was tough for me
[4:04:58] <Ghost__Pantsu> Thinking NotLikeThis
[4:04:59] <+SlappyMeats> MILES away
[4:05:00] <%Aydarkzero> does re2 count?
[4:05:01] <%D3rrtyD4n> @Sapphire_Breeze true, by the time he gets to re6 atpCap
[4:05:03] <%lionandfox21> oF COURSE
[4:05:04] <Fujiwara_92> think? what's that
[4:05:04] <Zaphire_Saucypants> yeah
[4:05:06] <rcand9> ye
[4:05:14] <%RubberFistFight> god it's 34 degrees C here right now i think my organs are melting
[4:05:15] <SMuffinMan> Miiiiles away
[4:05:17] <%RubberFistFight> why australia why
[4:05:25] <rcand9> magic
[4:05:32] <%Aydarkzero> it's gonna be about how the Spence estate exploded isn't it
[4:05:33] <+RETROxRELOADED> MAGIC
[4:05:34] <%doc_ock_rokc> Byleth confirmed slow marth
[4:05:40] <Fujiwara_92> magic
[4:05:40] <rcand9> science magic
[4:05:42] <%lionandfox21> In terms of distance it makes no sense foe the general geographical area of the city to forrest range
[4:05:42] <%stevesekai> Which is worse: this elevator or DS2?
[4:05:50] <Fujiwara_92> it's all magic
[4:05:51] <TalisKanju> This game screws up the geography of RE1 and 2
[4:05:52] <%Tracazoid> *Sees door to RE2 labs* ""Nothing to see here."
[4:05:59] <%SirGO0SE> mmm becky
[4:06:00] <ElenaManetta> yEAH GO BECKY
[4:06:03] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @RubberFistFight Did you hear about those asshole birds that learned if they drop a burning branch it makes their prey run into the open?
[4:06:04] <+DashXero> Becky's full of shit.
[4:06:04] <cesare92x> I think the background is just messing with you and that's not raccoon city in the background
[4:06:05] <zenith0111> brucegAhegao Byleath confirmed two genders
[4:06:09] <%Aydarkzero> Prequel syndrome don't worry about it @AngriestPat

[4:06:32] <simifu> Didn't Umbrella chronicles clear that up with the train time?
[4:06:36] <BurdRightsActivist> @zenith0111 There are two genders: Fire Emblem and "Other Nintendo Franchises"
[4:06:43] <causewaybob> Becky gonna do a shoot on da zambambo

[4:06:50] <x00Leon> the 2 tram rides
[4:06:50] <Fujiwara_92> it's all magic Pat
[4:06:51] <%TheSphereHunter> this game is the twilight zone Pat
[4:06:51] <%Aydarkzero> i wouldn't worry about it tbh

[4:11:47] <%natebud> They could have at the very least said that Enrico already checked it out.
[4:11:48] <%Aydarkzero> so you're telling me that two Stars members just happened to be right next to the umbrella lab and never question whats with this place?
[4:11:48] <BurdRightsActivist> "DOOR'S LOCKED!"
[4:11:48] <%stevesekai> Rebecca could've stopped the whole franchise RIGHT NOW
[4:11:49] <Fujiwara_92> shit's locked would've been better

[4:12:30] <TriadOrion> It broke out because it smelled a protagonist nearby
[4:12:30] <+Jokobeast> I was only half-listening to that conversation between Becky and Enrico but did that actually go: "I need to find Billy!" "Nah, don't worry about him." "PLZZZZZ???" "... Okay, fine."
[4:12:31] <%EndlessScrapper> In a Ace Attorney game Phoenix Wright who is no stranger to pilfering corpses refuses to let his partner take something out of a dead mans coat because "Its disrespectful to the dead" That item of course is the key evidence you need. I hate it when games pull that shit on you.
[4:12:32] <OswaldTheDog> AND HERE GOes the piano
[4:12:37] <+Brando_Brando> @AngriestPat Birkin let him out for a walk

[4:12:44] <Zaphire_Saucypants> he's actually pretty easy with the magnum, just stay behind him the whole time and aim up at his head.
[4:12:44] <BurdRightsActivist> GOd he looks so much creepier than regular tyrant
[4:12:44] <%natebud> Proto tyrant cutting a promo

[4:13:11] <simifu> OK THINK ABOUT THIS, SHE FOIGHT A TYRANT BY HERSELF...
[4:13:14] <tusk102> @moranprime no it's just a failed prototype
[4:13:14] <%RubberFistFight> @EndlessScrapper I too hate that, especially when later on they go "Oh man, main character, sucks that you didn't find the evidence, otherwise you'd have solved the case/won the game/whatever".
[4:13:14] <ElenaManetta> goddamn gluteus maximus
[4:13:17] <rcand9> that dumb swipe always got me

[4:13:32] <OswaldTheDog> this game is a fucking mess lmao
[4:13:33] <artoflec> i kind of love that animation of how you get thrown around
[4:13:33] <morcego_cinzento_arts> i don't know if it's official info. But i believe that those gigantic external hearts on the Tyrants are not their own heart but rater the heart of an large animal that was crafted into them to compensate for the massive amount of blood and adrenaline that tyrants produce
[4:13:37] <%kingbaconcrispy> You can catch him in a loop.
[4:13:38] <simifu> YET IN REMAKE SHE CANT HANDLE A HUNTER
[4:13:40] <tusk102> @moranprime they put too much t juice in him all at once and it fucked up his development cycle
[4:13:40] <%moranprime> His animations are creepy though
[4:13:42] <+Mitchellsocks> I tab away and there is a Tyrant

[4:14:58] <%cvp5127> shhhhhhh
[4:14:58] <the_millenial_falcon> It's a turbolift?
[4:14:58] <tusk102> oh no
[4:14:58] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @AngriestPat So why is a Tyrant loose literally 10 feet away from the LAB THAT STILL IN OPERATION
[4:15:01] <Fujiwara_92> MAGIC TIME
[4:15:01] <%stevesekai> Remember when Becky decided to throw all of this away so she couldn't fight a hunter?
[4:15:02] <%Aydarkzero> yeah
[4:15:04] <rytisone> the lab is in the city
[4:15:06] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Y'know, most older shotguns like that have a slide lock that you can depress, and that lets you slam fire it at insane fire rates.
[4:15:09] <%Maids4lyfe> magic elevator?
[4:15:13] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat Couldn't this be a different facility?
[4:15:14] <SMuffinMan> Bam back to the start
[4:15:14] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat This is one of those sideways willy-wonka elevators.
[4:15:16] <$shurtal> Why dont you draw a map in ms paint?
[4:15:19] <rcand9> lets go to spain chat

[4:15:22] <They_Call_Me_The_Fizz> Wesker destroyed an entire Umbrella operation to secure a Tyrant as the ultimate bioweapon to test on military combat... And the weakest member of S.T.A.R.S. just took a duplicate out all by herself......
[4:15:26] <%Aydarkzero> maybe the elevator goes sideways Kappa
[4:15:27] <%tank7013> WHAT

[4:16:02] <majima666> man umbrella has some crazy SHIT magic elevator tech.
[4:16:04] <%LaughingCatt> obviously this was cause by the viruses
[4:16:05] <%stevesekai> It's a G virus elevator
[4:16:07] <+RETROxRELOADED> doodChamp
[4:16:09] <worldbrand> and then it goes to aldia's keep
[4:16:13] <%Aydarkzero> i don't see a problem here Kappa
[4:16:15] <42nfl19> Maybe its just a long train...and you are on teh othe side
[4:16:18] <ElenaManetta> Japan thinks all trains are bullet trains
[4:16:18] <cn_monoxide> it’s simply a horizontal elevator
[4:16:21] <%natebud> I don't feel so good guys
[4:16:21] <cesare92x> evil within elevator
[4:16:23] <%Laecerelius> BUT WHERE'S THE VOLCANO, PAT?!
[4:16:25] <The_Maddness> No one who makes survival horror games seems to know/cares about how real guns work?
[4:16:28] <Valentinius_Anodyne> The flow of time is convoluted in Raccoon City
[4:16:28] <They_Call_Me_The_Fizz> The elevator moved sideways...
[4:16:29] <%SirGO0SE> i want to see these tracks
[4:16:31] <%damienlunas> it's a Wonkavator!
[4:16:32] <%kingbaconcrispy> Hunter!
[4:16:37] <+JohnMcClane6194> this dumbass elevator literally wouldn't need to be in the game if they didn't get rid of the item boxes
[4:16:37] <%juxtest> And Floor 3 is the Iron Keep
[4:16:41] <%XeroSigmaPrime> IS THIS DARK SOULS 2

[4:16:48] <Fro5tburn> LUL
[4:16:50] <%moranprime> Super Armor on that Hunter
[4:16:51] <%lionandfox21> i always assumed its a at least a two hour distance from the training facility to the mansion
[4:16:52] <%natebud> It'd be bad if you died here by the way
[4:16:52] <majima666> tour guide interupted by a hunter
[4:16:54] <%rumtumtugnutz> Wonkavator
[4:16:54] <TalisKanju> Nice delay there
[4:16:54] <Zaphire_Saucypants> yes
[4:16:56] <tusk102> super armor
[4:16:56] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat If you think that's crazy, check out Floor 4! It takes you to the Umbrella Facility in Antartica.
[4:16:56] <King_Wolf_Rigger> yup
[4:16:56] <+conradical> that hit delay is ridiculous
[4:16:57] <%TheSphereHunter> this game actually scares me with that animation delay shit
[4:17:00] <+Jokobeast> Speaking of Hunters no-selling shotgun blasts mid-air.
[4:17:02] <%Aydarkzero> he dodged your shot
[4:17:02] <+BisoromiBear> i missed it again
[4:17:06] <zenith0111> doodCap " You like delay netcode?"
[4:17:07] <simifu> get a better PC KAppa
[4:17:07] <%SirGO0SE> darksouls 2 does it bad but different
[4:17:07] <cesare92x> ElevatEr anyone?
[4:17:10] <%tank7013> That was some bullllll shit
[4:17:12] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> ending is soon, right?
[4:17:15] <%Binary_Fireball> @angriestpat don't you need to save?
[4:17:15] <%Shadicara> LUL
[4:17:17] <Zaphire_Saucypants> thanks goodness heals
[4:17:17] <ElenaManetta> Since I don't have to play this game, I'm in constant awe as these camera angles and backgrounds
[4:17:18] <+SlappyMeats> the elevator actually does go sideways when you use the emergency key at the end of RE2; the animation of the screen takes special care to reflect that
[4:17:20] <%ssjklyco> The netcode on the hunters is poor
[4:17:21] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat lol so WC3 reforged just launched and apparently it's a bug-filled asset-reusing ripoff nightmare. LUL
[4:17:21] <+arancet> oh god, that hunter frog croak sound brings up ragnarok online ptsd in me
[4:17:25] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @artoflec Yeah like the tyrants not only are like a rare mutation of a human infected with the T-virus(like 1 in a 100 k or more). But they need a ton of surgery and other operations just to hone them into a usable creature. Like this Tyrant and the one in the Spencer state are the templates of the project but the MR.X tyrants are the actual production models meant to be used
[4:17:27] <%rumtumtugnutz> It's a Wonkavator
[4:17:27] <ElenaManetta> Everytime I see one that is like, going through a gate or window I'm like COOL
[4:17:28] <The_Maddness> What are Hunters made from again? Frogs?
[4:17:30] <troytaco> i felt like the tyrant wasnt taking damage while he was in his crouched down state too ;/
[4:17:33] <%stevesekai> The hunters are magic just like the elevator
[4:17:34] <ElenaManetta> Dynamic shots down the stairs and shit
[4:17:38] <rytisone> umbrella is just reusing architecture plans for their facilities, I think
[4:17:38] <tanarath> Night, Pat.
[4:17:38] <Serge_12> Thats Bullshit Blazing!
[4:17:39] <Fujiwara_92> @arancet I KNOW RIGHT
[4:17:39] <They_Call_Me_The_Fizz> Umbrella made that elevator out of the same material as the mansion's storage crates
[4:17:39] <%Dragovus> @AngriestPat At least RE0 has death screams for it's hunters
[4:17:45] <%Shadicara> Got you good boi
[4:17:46] <Huntercd> One hit dropped her health so much
[4:17:51] <rcand9> ah yes

[4:17:54] <zenith0111> doodBigBrain atpLaw apatCanada

[4:17:58] <%natebud> yeyeyeyeyeye
[4:18:02] <outis94> your doing that thing that designers hate
[4:18:07] <%EndlessScrapper> Actually I recall in RE7 the leaper variant of the molded would sometimes ignore a shotgun blast when jumping at you.
[4:18:07] <FirearmsInstructor> This is some Star Trek DS9 tech wormhole bullshit

[4:20:00] <+arancet> hes passed out in a raging river yet somehow caught on rocks AND kept his head above the water?!
[4:20:01] <$GameOverDeo> He died again
[4:20:01] <%stevesekai> You ever just wake up in some rapids
[4:20:01] <rytisone> and then he gets impaled like Lara Croft
[4:20:04] <%rumtumtugnutz> DEAD
[4:20:04] <%Darastrix> I swear this one and CVX feel more like House of the Dead than Resident Evil.
[4:20:06] <morcego_cinzento_arts> You know i can kinda understand that the villain being a revived Marcus with his youth restored and he can control the leeches...but why the fucking ugly dress and the oepra singing?
[4:20:10] <Hellarussian> the virus juice
[4:20:16] <kscars> where me billy go?
[4:20:18] <FirearmsInstructor> From RE3?

[4:21:20] <TalisKanju> Umbrella is using the same stuff that allows Simmons to transform into a t-rex and back into a human
[4:21:21] <%stevesekai> He cut out all the failed attempts
[4:21:23] <zenith0111> DID A BIG THINK
[4:21:26] <%EndlessScrapper> So since Billy and Becky were both bitten in cutscenes and they have no way to produce DAYLIGHT they should be well screwed. Even if Becky gets the cure when they get back to the city Billy just wanders off and transforms.
[4:21:27] <%SirGO0SE> billy need protec
[4:21:28] <ElenaManetta> TODAY?
[4:21:28] <tusk102> get ed

[4:21:39] <rytisone> not much till the end
[4:21:39] <Zaphire_Saucypants> we're actually pretty closeish to the end of the game
[4:21:39] <+arancet> but if you play more now you suffer less later
[4:21:40] <%natebud> Just long enough to die to a frog

[4:21:51] <+Shadope342> becky just leaving a breadcrumb trail her whole adventure
[4:21:53] <%D3rrtyD4n> i dont want to think about it
[4:21:53] <$GameOverDeo> You do love backtracking
[4:21:54] <%lionandfox21> I always assumed the differences came from the types of materials being transported and disposed of at each respective facility, cause thats how its done with labs I work with
[4:21:54] <Hellarussian> all over
[4:21:59] <ElenaManetta> nah, it don't exist
[4:22:00] <rcand9> what items did you leave in the marshalling yard?
[4:22:00] <%spiritofmojave> don't give two shits to think about it
[4:22:01] <ElenaManetta> forget about it
[4:22:02] <%natebud> It's worse now that you moved all that stuff to the observatory
[4:22:02] <+STAETTER> You should just use the box.
[4:22:04] <zenith0111> calebJOY
[4:22:05] <kscars> quality design
[4:22:06] <%SirGO0SE> beat it imo. imagine not having to start a stream for this again
[4:22:07] <FirearmsInstructor> Pat you missed a green herb back in the west wing bathroom after the train crash.
[4:22:08] <%Aydarkzero> you didn't need that ammo Kappa
[4:22:08] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat Maybe the magic Elevator was because of the Item drop nonsense
[4:22:09] <BurdRightsActivist> GUESS WE'LL BACK TRACK
[4:22:09] <ElenaManetta> if you don't remember it it don't exist protip
[4:22:11] <Fujiwara_92> forget those itens

[4:22:14] <simifu> ah yes the wet sock sound effect KAppa
[4:22:14] <%Aydarkzero> hey look zombies

[4:22:16] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Scattered the four winds for whom Crom cares not.
[4:22:20] <+arancet> shit i remember the press run up to this game advertising the item dropping as a BOLD NEW FEATURE
[4:22:20] <tusk102> @AngriestPat the room we've just established as being 2 inches away via that elevator
[4:22:22] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @ThatOneGuyYouSaw Good point. but there is like goofy and fun pretencious, like Irons or Alfred. And there is just lame(like this case of Marcus)
[4:22:23] <JoelFleran> nice

[4:22:35] <%natebud> The magic elevator dumps you right back and the mansion hall, should have left the stuff there
[4:22:37] <%moranprime> So this facility is the top part of the G-virus fact--I give up lol
[4:22:39] <%Laecerelius> Pat is known for his love of doing shit over again
[4:22:42] <kscars> those juicy meat slaps

[4:23:15] <%arcaderabbit48> This is, ironically, like how SH4 The Room introduced item boxes of its own. It solves a problem that did not exist, and nobody asked to have solved.

[4:24:43] <%Dragovus> Wesker wants the good Tyrant
[4:24:45] <%stevesekai> Does Berkin count as a Tyrant?

[4:25:30] <%TwinBat> billy is never far from out hearts
[4:25:30] <ElenaManetta> Maybe he's getting thrown into the ocean RIGHT NOW
[4:25:30] <tusk102> and actually: the proto tyrant has MORE t virus juice since it got fucked up from having too much injected into it
[4:25:31] <the_millenial_falcon> I guess since there are no item boxes they were forced to smoosh all the areas together beyond reason
[4:25:34] <+STAETTER> Billie Eilish
[4:25:35] <+rdark_ksu> There is a great distance from here to "the Billy"
[4:25:39] <$RetroCop87> What's really funny is that if you splice all the original and retconned lore, there's like 5 simultaneous plans to fuck over Umbrella happening during the Spencer estate incident
[4:25:44] <cesare92x> Greta thunberg won't be happy about all this litter on the floor
[4:25:47] <%SirGO0SE> the billeh is looping on me and become painfully funny again
[4:25:48] <FirearmsInstructor> Man... water currents are CRAZY
[4:25:52] <ElenaManetta> WHAT

[4:27:16] <cesare92x> so this is gonna be a 3 part stream?
[4:27:22] <morcego_cinzento_arts> Okay i can kinda defend that Wesker does not get proto tyrant here right away cause it's on the underground big cheese lab of umbrella under Racoon City. so it might be difficult to take the tyrant without anyone catching him. With the mansion incident was just good luck for him to find this oportunity to retrieve that Tyrant without the vigilance of any Umbrella personel
[4:27:24] <%moranprime> Time to fight the Proto Tyrant again
[4:27:24] <Zaphire_Saucypants> yay Billy

[4:33:03] <Fujiwara_92> item bridge
[4:33:03] <rcand9> billy naked
[4:33:09] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat What if the magic elevator was soley for item collection
[4:33:09] <ElenaManetta> aka a closet
[4:33:10] <%W1nterTitan> Really? This is the game?
[4:33:19] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @tusk102 Im not telling him to play more, im just saying how much time is left
[4:33:19] <%moranprime> Hopefully they dont get washed away by the water spout
[4:33:22] <%luftraumm1> walking around unarmed to move items is dumb as shit
[4:33:26] <xxshadowxx416> 15 hours
[4:33:33] <rytisone> now quickly, eliminator attack
[4:33:35] <+WheatlyXT> When no item box exist you must be own item box
[4:33:39] <tusk102> @AngriestPat what happens if there's not enough "item burden" in the hallway
[4:33:41] <ElenaManetta> wait can you d rop items in the elevator?
[4:33:45] <FirearmsInstructor> OH GOD what happens if you leave stuff in the FRONT HALLWAY
[4:33:55] <rcand9> how did they figure that out and not add an item box or too man
[4:34:06] <%doc_ock_rokc> @FirearmsInstructor Fuck you thats what
[4:34:07] <%natebud> @FirearmsInstructor It would have been better actually since the elevator drops you off right there
[4:34:09] <Fujiwara_92> re0 in one sentence: grab item from place A and take it to place B, then profit
[4:34:18] <%SirGO0SE> apatSmug
[4:34:23] <ElenaManetta> it was someone's vision
[4:34:24] <%Aydarkzero> they wanted to try something different
[4:34:24] <%stevesekai> It was to show off the TECH
[4:34:26] <Zaphire_Saucypants> They probably just wanted to be different.
[4:34:35] <%doc_ock_rokc> Its easier to make a teleporter and probably because they didn't have the memory for a Item box
[4:34:38] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Stubborn "we need might as well commit to it"
[4:34:51] <%moranprime> Good thing the items you leave on the train before it crashes don't get wrecked
[4:34:52] <rcand9> physically impossible
[4:34:52] <tusk102> not only did they not add an item box, but they thought to put a item burden in items instead of just adding the box
[4:34:55] <smugjorgen98> how much of this game would be fixed if it had an item box
[4:34:55] <+RETROxRELOADED> Finally a more realistic RE for the true gamers...
[4:34:58] <rcand9> magic elevator
[4:34:59] <%ssjklyco> because it was too garbage to playtest more than once
[4:35:02] <arkv01> this game taught highschoolers the meaning of commitment and sunk cpsts
[4:35:03] <%poohtrailsnailcooch> Re 0 is like migraine
[4:35:05] <rcand9> that will do it
[4:35:08] <Fujiwara_92> just add a magic elevator
[4:35:12] <+SlappyMeats> "Ok what if we make some RE2 screens take you back there"
[4:35:20] <Zaphire_Saucypants> you didn't leave anything past the tram?
[4:35:21] <%SirGO0SE> Just how long was the dev time on this? I feel like it came out really quickly after RE1 remake
[4:35:23] <%Aydarkzero> game development is easy Kappa
[4:35:27] <Zaphire_Saucypants> back in the lab?
[4:35:31] <%doc_ock_rokc> I get the idea of hey I dropped an item here to come back to it
[4:35:41] <%ssjklyco> @sirgo0se technically since the N64
[4:35:41] <%doc_ock_rokc> But ITEM BOXES WITH THAT WOULD BE GREAT
[4:35:57] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat What do you think this is? A beautifully planned level design layout like in a dark souls? Fuck you!
[4:36:00] <cesare92x> I think this came out 2 years later on the prototype base of the game
[4:36:02] <%moranprime> Time to pick up even more
[4:36:04] <tusk102> he needs the room to grab items
[4:36:06] <rcand9> yes
[4:36:16] <%CalderGaming> ART
[4:36:17] <ElenaManetta> Attache Hallway
[4:36:18] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> beat it tinight
[4:36:19] <rcand9> and what a room it is
[4:36:19] <cesare92x> and they applied the rule of the prototype mode where item boxes are not linked together
[4:36:23] <%SirGO0SE> @ssjklyco yeah i learned that earlier but this has a very "majora's mask" attempt feel to it in respect to reusing assets
[4:36:23] <%XeroSigmaPrime> THIS GAME IS ART
[4:36:27] <%moranprime> Wesker and William must be like: "What the heck are they doin?!"
[4:36:27] <%luftraumm1> aaaaaaaaaaart

[4:39:16] <Zaphire_Saucypants> there's a molotov there but okay
[4:39:17] <%Shadicara> I think finishing this now is a good call you'd definitely kick yourself playing this another day LUL
[4:39:18] <%Laecerelius> Guess you'll be down a healing item now!
[4:39:21] <%doc_ock_rokc> really
[4:39:22] <%poohtrailsnailcooch> cheer1000 Hey Pat you and Elmo are something, but have you ever played the entirety of the Witcher game series? If so what did you think of it?

[4:39:26] <DuoScratch> mollies to deal with the zimbos?
[4:39:27] <cesare92x> that's why I never move the items away from the main hall
[4:39:29] <FirearmsInstructor> FAS?
[4:39:30] <%natebud> Might as well take the molotovs to clear out those zombies without getting hit
[4:39:31] <tusk102> is that a first aid spray next to it
[4:39:34] <luckycloud91> Take the molotovs
[4:39:34] <rcand9> becky take

[4:41:25] <Zaphire_Saucypants> super worth it
[4:41:26] <tusk102> @AngriestPat you should take a couple minute break to pet the baby and destress
[4:41:26] <%ssjklyco> Rib-ecca
[4:41:28] <%akumakins> This game is way longer than I remember.
[4:41:33] <%natebud> used two just getting back and forth
[4:41:33] <ElenaManetta> PissedPat
[4:41:35] <rcand9> healing items to heal
[4:41:37] <cesare92x> you got enough ammo and heals for Queenie?
[4:41:37] <%SirGO0SE> great stream tho
[4:41:48] <Fujiwara_92> time to waste all of them in the way to the other items NotLikeThis
[4:41:48] <%RubberFistFight> well it all helps the Angriest Pat brand, right? Kappa
[4:41:53] <%FacetiousAF> chat, seriously, is there like a %-done for pat's current progress you could give me?
[4:41:54] <%XeroSigmaPrime> PUNISHED PAT
[4:41:57] <%lionandfox21> A six hours game that turns into a wily wonka level of boring
[4:41:57] <+PanicSwytch> And there's more healing items before the final boss
[4:42:00] <ElenaManetta> Pissed Pat is better than Poopy Pat
[4:42:02] <cesare92x> 80
[4:42:03] <rcand9> think about resting tho pat save sanity
[4:42:06] <TalisKanju> That "Angriest" in "AngriestPat" now looking like it fits
[4:42:06] <the_millenial_falcon> I'd say about 85%
[4:42:09] <%luftraumm1> it's good you have us to cheer you on
[4:42:16] <%FacetiousAF> this is getting to be work for the pat
[4:42:20] <Heartless_01> but doesn't rebecca's cuteness make up for the frustration?
[4:42:22] <tusk102> apatPat apatPat apatPat
[4:42:24] <cesare92x> got enough ammo and heals for Queenie?
[4:42:24] <%natebud> no
[4:42:30] <FirearmsInstructor> @XeroSigmaPrime Do you actually want AIDS? Because that's how you get AIDS.
[4:42:31] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Heartless_01 YES
[4:42:35] <%SirGO0SE> queen is mostly shotgun right
[4:42:36] <%natebud> Lots of better RE games have good hats
[4:42:38] <Zaphire_Saucypants> me neither
[4:42:44] <%lionandfox21> To spook you
[4:42:46] <%sporeian94> How old is rebecca in this game...
[4:42:48] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @FirearmsInstructor Hahahahah
[4:42:48] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat scares pat
[4:42:49] <Fujiwara_92> just to fuck with you
[4:42:50] <%arcaderabbit48> Why do people like Rebecca so much?
[4:42:51] <%doc_ock_rokc> scares
[4:42:51] <%Aydarkzero> he brings the room together nicely
[4:42:51] <%Maids4lyfe> 18
[4:42:52] <%PauliusMaximus> hes just there to hold the mugnum
[4:42:53] <the_millenial_falcon> He's still got one more boss before the final one iirc.
[4:42:56] <cesare92x> got enough ammo and heals for Queenie?
[4:42:58] <%Laecerelius> He's there to do his jerb
[4:42:58] <arkv01> dankass prerendered backgrounds
[4:42:58] <%Shadicara> For the spook
[4:42:59] <Ran196> becky is old enough
[4:43:07] <tusk102> @sporeian94 older than 18. she's a police officer
[4:43:09] <Zaphire_Saucypants> nothin like a corpse to really pull off the Feng Shui
[4:43:10] <rcand9> time for fun
[4:43:15] <artoflec> I find it so stupid that you just..have to drop shit on the floor
[4:43:27] <%lionandfox21> @tusk102 Dude she's canonically 18 in this game lol
[4:43:28] <tusk102> @sporeian94 so like. 19-20 i think?
[4:43:32] <%Shadicara> LUL
[4:43:32] <sadolerlaqreet1> Rebecca is five years old
[4:43:32] <tusk102> oh is she?
[4:43:34] <%SirGO0SE> ydont say
[4:43:37] <rcand9> that is stupid huh?
[4:43:41] <Fujiwara_92> you don't say
[4:43:42] <tusk102> @lionandfox21 is she? good to know
[4:43:44] <cesare92x> got enough ammo and heals for Queenie?
[4:43:49] <+RaziWraith> What have we been talking about? LUL
[4:43:52] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Rebecca is the kind of "18" that looks 16.
[4:43:57] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Its weird that this takes place right before RE1, considering the huge difference in scope
[4:44:01] <Ran196> if this was an anime, Rebecca would probably be 12 years old
[4:44:03] <%ha2ken> Funny thing is...that actually makes more sense than a magic item box...
[4:44:03] <+WheatlyXT> Rebecca is a 3,000 year old myth dragon actually
[4:44:07] <%Maids4lyfe> you can't be a cop at 16
[4:44:07] <%jessedouglas> I love RE but I don't think I could ever beat this game. I've only played the train part and I plan to keep it that way!
[4:44:08] <Heartless_01> old enough
[4:44:09] <tusk102> rebecca is the kind of 18 that wesker likes sports pictures of
[4:44:09] <rcand9> 2 phases remember
[4:44:10] <%lionandfox21> @tusk102 yeah she's a genius who finishedcollege early and joint the police hence the rookie bit
[4:44:12] <BurdRightsActivist> @artoflec Wouldn't it be convient to have like, something you can put all your items in and get them later, maybe like a box or something? idk, radical though
[4:44:13] <%akumakins> Rebecca is the kind of "18" that lands you in jail outside of Alabama
[4:44:18] <Fujiwara_92> Becca is fated with the curse of always looking like a 16 years old
[4:44:20] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Oh shit you forgot the hookshot!
[4:44:26] <%Valdorick> Rebecca had no idea with what was happening.
[4:44:28] <the_millenial_falcon> I would settle for an attache case in this game.
[4:44:30] <arkv01> wait whats going on in alabama?
[4:44:31] <ShichiNoBushi> Does Billy ever show up in any other RE games?
[4:44:31] <artoflec> @BurdRightsActivist hmmmm i dont know if Capcom can figure that one out artofl1Hm
[4:44:32] <rcand9> queen a and queen b
[4:44:34] <%SirGO0SE> yes its been discovered that becky is actually biki. shes cousins with tiki
[4:44:35] <%LaughingCatt> oh jee i wonder why
[4:44:38] <%peachy996> Man this is like REmake but with all of the personality removed
[4:44:40] <+freeizone> remember those giant bugs!? nope
[4:44:41] <%natebud> I feel the drop mechanic was made by someone sick of people asking why they couldn't drop stuff. Then made it terrible to ensure that no one would ever complain again.
[4:44:42] <Zaphire_Saucypants> @ShichiNoBushi I don't think so, no.
[4:44:46] <FirearmsInstructor> @rcand9 LUL
[4:44:48] <Fujiwara_92> almost like this was made after re1
[4:44:48] <LongJohn> Giant scorpion, don't worry about it though
[4:44:48] <%Tracazoid> Hey Rebecca had a hard time, she just kind of forgot, like the Dothraki.
[4:44:48] <+RowenCleric> this game also tells us almost NOTHING new about viruses or origins or anything
[4:44:49] <%arcaderabbit48> @AngriestPat Rebecca goes through RE1 and never fucking once mentions any of this to Chris! It makes no fucking sense!
[4:44:50] <tusk102> @lionandfox21 more genius than chris that drove jets at 2 years old Kappa
[4:44:55] <%FacetiousAF> 0 isn't canon, understood
[4:44:57] <FirearmsInstructor> Forward left
[4:44:59] <%D3rrtyD4n> i can, its the shiny
[4:45:02] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I see it
[4:45:07] <42nfl19> @AngriestPat Are you sure you need those items to beat the game? Is there not enough ahead of you to finish? You've beaten other RE games in excess before.. I can't tell if it is just that you are too good and scrounge everything.
[4:45:08] <%arcaderabbit48> None of this game makes any sense, and actively makes other parts of the series worse by existing!
[4:45:09] <chambatron> Elmo's paw <3
[4:45:11] <%akumakins> @arkv01 pretty sure the legal age there is 16
[4:45:14] <%D3rrtyD4n> lol
[4:45:16] <%ssjklyco> It's the Sheva of Resident Evil games in that Wesker doesn't remember
[4:45:16] <Jolnir> Caliban cove Kappa
[4:45:17] <%D3rrtyD4n> oh boy
[4:45:19] <Fujiwara_92> can you at home find it kids
[4:45:19] <%lionandfox21> Isn't there a paper that vaguely reference this event in the N64 RE2?
[4:45:21] <FirearmsInstructor> Behind rail
[4:45:24] <zeus200045> Well that's probably because Rebecca is literally never mentioned past this game too
[4:45:25] <Zaphire_Saucypants> oh yeah...this problem
[4:45:29] <rytisone> out of sight
[4:45:35] <rcand9> so many honkin items
[4:45:42] <arkv01> @akumakins oh lawd
[4:45:43] <$GameOverDeo> so good
[4:45:44] <SilverJakler> Are the RE duos always a guy and a girl?
[4:45:53] <%TwinBat> what a neat game :)
[4:45:57] <FirearmsInstructor> WHY'D HE BITE ME!??
[4:45:58] <Zaphire_Saucypants> yeah the dropping items shit DOES NOT work well with fixed camera angles.
[4:45:59] <%Valdorick> What a great system, its so realistic, instead of having a magic item teleporting box.
[4:45:59] <tusk102> @SilverJakler no. in revelations 2 it's two girls
[4:46:00] <cesare92x> RE6 Has Chris and Piers 2 men
[4:46:03] <Guardiansaiyan> @SilverJakler yups
[4:46:03] <Fujiwara_92> game design
[4:46:05] <luckycloud91> Leave the fuel
[4:46:06] <tusk102> and re6
[4:46:09] <%RubberFistFight> I love how elmo is occasionally touching Pat on the arm, it's like he's making sure that his human is still ok.
[4:46:11] <arkv01> wasn't there that one game with chris and leon and chris is hounding leon the whole game? wait no thats twitter LUL
[4:46:12] <%arcaderabbit48> @zeus200045 That's not fair! She gets a non-canon cameo as a player character in RE5's multiplayer survival mode :>
[4:46:16] <%SirGO0SE> POWERFUL SNEEZE
[4:46:16] <ElenaManetta> you woke up elmo
[4:46:16] <kawaii_village> Bless you!
[4:46:20] <%wrightlight94> Bless you Pat
[4:46:23] <%Darastrix> I think Pat should play RE2 Remake going for the challenge of never opening the Storage Box apatWink
[4:46:28] <tusk102> in re6 chris and piers and in rev2 it's moira and claire
[4:46:32] <+JohnMarkley> hello everyone :) /
[4:46:33] <%ssjklyco> Play temtem on Thursday
[4:46:34] <rcand9> SAVE/ROTATE
[4:46:36] <WaxWitch> o/
[4:46:37] <FirearmsInstructor> Fuck this game feels SO BAD
[4:46:37] <BurdRightsActivist> @arkv01 THE REDFIELD BLOODLINE THOUGH..
[4:46:43] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Are you playing this correctly???
[4:46:47] <tusk102> LEON I NEED YOU TO FUCK CLAIRE
[4:46:49] <%lionandfox21> @SilverJakler it seems it was the trend for awhile cause even re7 did with Ethan and Mia
[4:46:49] <%SABiscotti> SABiscotti subscribed at Tier 1. 
[4:46:51] <graemecrackers1> ELMO <3
[4:46:51] <+conradical> i think there's something really funny about two people trying to survive looking at all these useful items that they could use and then just throwing them on the ground
[4:46:54] <Zaphire_Saucypants> alright
[4:46:55] <%natebud> Billy clean up your room
[4:46:57] <%CalderGaming> alright
[4:46:57] <%lionandfox21> Kay pat
[4:46:57] <DusK_The_Stray> Pat always sneezes like a wild coyote
[4:46:58] <+BisoromiBear> good call
[4:46:58] <%FacetiousAF> smart
[4:47:00] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> noooo
[4:47:01] <WaxWitch> fair enough
[4:47:03] <%SirGO0SE> apatCrazyhand
[4:47:03] <FirearmsInstructor> Something seems INCREDIBLY WRONG
[4:47:03] <Zaphire_Saucypants> have a good game on backup for after?
[4:47:05] <Fujiwara_92> good thinking
[4:47:05] <%theo_marks> Fair enouuugh
[4:47:08] <KirbonicAcid> okey dokey
[4:47:09] <arkv01> @BurdRightsActivist yeah well THE CHAMBERs BLOODLINE THIRSTS FOR OFFSPRING TOO
[4:47:10] <%Valdorick> Man, and we thought Code Veronica X was bad.
[4:47:10] <%akumakins> @arkv01 I'll keep my future daughters as far away from that state as I can.
[4:47:12] <+WheatlyXT> Billy can’t clean his room
[4:47:13] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Fair
[4:47:14] <%Jekado> scream stream
[4:47:14] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat You're beyond pissed, you're like.... seething LUL
[4:47:15] <%doc_ock_rokc> He screm
[4:47:15] <%D3rrtyD4n> atpCap
[4:47:17] <%FacetiousAF> hey chat. let's all scream with pat. FUUCCKK THIIISSS GAAAAMMEEEE
[4:47:17] <ElenaManetta> this is like watching those bird documentaries where the bird slowly, one-by-one picks up an object and or ganizes it in their nest
[4:47:17] <Fro5tburn> MYAAA
[4:47:17] <Fujiwara_92> scream
[4:47:19] <Zaphire_Saucypants> A Palette Cleanser
[4:47:19] <%theo_marks> rare that a horror game makes you scream these days
[4:47:19] <OhSleepySheepy> please pet your cat and feel better ;A;
[4:47:20] <tusk102> LEON I NEED YOU TO HAVE A CHILD WITH CLAIRE ONLY YOUR GENES ARE GOOD ENOUGH FOR HER
[4:47:22] <%arcaderabbit48> I always knew Resident Evil 4 was a gamechanger, but seeing this game and Code Veronica really helps put it in perspective. RE4 was a slam dunk after years of fouls
[4:47:22] <%natebud> Find a sturdy sound absorbing pillow
[4:47:24] <DrFacilier> Im starting to think this game isnt great
[4:47:25] <%ssjklyco> Pat has become Elmo
[4:47:25] <%mh9s> you chose this fate patrick
[4:47:27] <+WheatlyXT> Billy can only hold 6 things at once
[4:47:27] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat it's alright man after this you can go on twitter and yell at shitheads, we know how much you love that.
[4:47:29] <%jessedouglas> and no one can blame you for screaming
[4:47:30] <FirearmsInstructor> subtle seethe
[4:47:33] <gnarlie_brown88> funnee scream
[4:47:33] <+BisoromiBear> wild and crazy
[4:47:34] <%CalderGaming> apatPat apatPat apatPat apatSmug
[4:47:36] <arkv01> ok TBH Leon does have some GOODASS genes
[4:47:37] <nademonkey1100> what did i miss
[4:47:39] <ElenaManetta> I think most players would ju--
[4:47:39] <SilverJakler> Scream into Elmo's fluff
[4:47:41] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> sugoiGuts2 I'm going to scream if you don't finish it
[4:47:41] <ElenaManetta> oh i was typing that
[4:47:45] <%SirGO0SE> yep
[4:47:45] <ElenaManetta> haha
[4:47:46] <rcand9> i think so
[4:47:46] <tusk102> leon's got perfect genes
[4:47:49] <FirearmsInstructor> "Use it or lose it"?
[4:47:49] <TalisKanju> Keep in mind, REmake came out between CVX and RE0
[4:47:49] <OhSleepySheepy> go be happy and talk to your pretty lady
[4:47:51] <+WheatlyXT> Get Pat a chocolate orange stat
[4:47:51] <+SlappyMeats> I mean at the time it wasn't a "problem" it was the mechanic, which is a problem
[4:48:02] <mankeytennis> Get your items sorted tonight, you don't want that shit waiting for you tomorrow.
[4:48:04] <%lionandfox21> I think the magic of RE remake definitely helped this game live
[4:48:07] <Fro5tburn> chocolate orange? I love those PogChamp
[4:48:14] <tusk102> leon and claire's child would be beautiful -Chris "Fuck my sister" Redfield
[4:48:16] <Fujiwara_92> it's not... is it?
[4:48:26] <Zaphire_Saucypants> chocolate oranges are fuckin delicious
[4:48:26] <$GameOverDeo> DrinkPurple
[4:48:26] <%natebud> It's much worse for people who want to collect every item.
[4:48:41] <rcand9> gun survivor
[4:48:43] <%lionandfox21> DEAD AIM
[4:48:48] <cesare92x> I nice change of theme would be you play as the bad guy, you fuck it up, zombies all over and bsaa or blue umbrella is after you
[4:48:49] <%Mindtrick_Matt> Gaiden
[4:48:52] <%SirGO0SE> and cvx
[4:48:53] <artoflec> dead aim's the REALLY bad one right
[4:48:55] <%lionandfox21> Gameboy color ports
[4:48:55] <majima666> gun survivor is canon too :O
[4:48:55] <%SirGO0SE> lmfao
[4:48:56] <+Mittensbro> Telling a survival horror game player to not hoard items is kind of like designing a vending machine so that the soda cans inside will always fall forward and get stuck on the glass so they don't fall.
[4:48:58] <TalisKanju> CVX, Gaiden
[4:48:59] <%BlueMoonBlues> Was Outbreak before 0?
[4:48:59] <%Bluwizard21> @AngriestPat how much is left of this shit?
[4:49:00] <arkv01> "all secret service agents with the surname are officially invited to fuck my sister"
[4:49:02] <TriadOrion> CVX, Gaiden,... .Outbreak?
[4:49:06] <ElenaManetta> I bet they were like, "It AMPS UP the difficulty, yeah, like classic RE1 with the limited typewriter ribbons!".
[4:49:10] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat 1996 Resident Evil 1997 1998 Resident Evil 2 1999 Resident Evil 3: Nemesis 2000 Resident Evil Survivor Resident Evil – Code: Veronica 2001 Resident Evil Gaiden Resident Evil Survivor 2 – Code: Veronica 2002 Resident Evil (remake) Resident Evil Zero 2003 Resident Evil: Dead Aim Resident Evil Outbreak 2004 Resident Evil Outbreak: File #2 2005 Resident Evil 4 2006 2007 Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles 2008 2009 Resident Evil 5 Resident Evil: The Darkside Chronicles 2010 2011 Resi
[4:49:12] <Rexenexus> Dead Aim is the best of the gun survivor games but that's not saying much
[4:49:25] <%Malchiah_Tenabre> there were two survivor games ?!?!?!?
[4:49:26] <Zaphire_Saucypants> @Bluwizard21 We're on the last map.
[4:49:26] <Rexenexus> Dead Aim is more Resident Evil than 4 lmao
[4:49:31] <zeus200045> Maybe the real problem is that they still haven't changed the damn setting of the game since the first one
[4:49:37] <arkv01> the hell is gaiden
[4:49:38] <artoflec> count in binary dumby
[4:49:49] <the_millenial_falcon> gaiden is a shitty gbc game
[4:49:50] <%sporeian94> RE, Apocalypse, Extinction, Afterlife, Retribution, The Final Chatper
[4:49:53] <%lionandfox21> Holy shit that's alot of games
[4:49:53] <arkv01> oh we streaming gaiden?
[4:49:55] <zeus200045> I mean there's only so much you can do with one city and the surrounding area
[4:50:02] <%natebud> You just made a trip for 30 handgun rounds and an herb LUL
[4:50:03] <%SirGO0SE> @artoflec lol'd irl at this
[4:50:05] <majima666> honestly, for a gameboy game i dont think gaiden is THAT bad
[4:50:06] <$GameOverDeo> RalpherZ
[4:50:07] <x00Leon> any plans for dead aim
[4:50:15] <lionandfox21> I wonder if we're ever gonna get more spin offs
[4:50:23] <TalisKanju> Gaiden LOOKS great for a Game Boy Color game
[4:50:25] <FirearmsInstructor> How long until Umbrella Corps??
[4:50:27] <%Bluwizard21> @AngriestPat Can you start Re4 Tomorrow off this? cause I need a cleanser
[4:50:27] <%EndlessScrapper> Gaiden being the only game before Rev2 where you could play as Barry.
[4:50:28] <%sporeian94> Any plans to fly to Japan to play the Pachislots
[4:50:32] <Fujiwara_92> any plans for gaiden Kappa
[4:50:33] <SilverJakler> Is this the zapping system?
[4:50:34] <Ran196> Play Deadly Silence Pat, play it so you can poke Jill and Chris
[4:50:39] <%Shadowpint> We did with Resistance
[4:50:50] <tusk102> why do they love raccoon city so much? like they talk about bio weapons being all over the world but so many of the games take place in this area
[4:50:51] <+ultimafullmetal> I rented Dead Aim back in the day. I don't remember hating it.
[4:50:53] <luckycloud91> How about RE Destiny?
[4:50:55] <ElenaManetta> If Sonic, Silent Hill, Spyro, Pokemon, Fallout, and Paper Mario taught me anything it's that a game coming out later down the pipeline doesn't mean it'll be improved mechanically than the older games.
[4:50:57] <Futurecity10> do I continue to watch pats decent into madness, or do I go and masterbate
[4:50:57] <%lionandfox21> @SilverJakler Nah, that's RE2
[4:51:03] <majima666> i did play the prototype of the cancelled port the re1 on the gbc. ambitious as it is i can see why they scrapped it
[4:51:05] <%Bluwizard21> @Zaphire_Saucypants thanks for the info
[4:51:06] <$GameOverDeo> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[4:51:08] <FirearmsInstructor> I think I'm developing anxiety with no previous history of it watching you try to do this.....
[4:51:10] <+SlappyMeats> As stupid as it was to keep belaboring Raccoon City and the Mansion Incident, diluting the events beyond recognition, CV just hauled off and say 'OK ANTARCTICA THEN"
[4:51:16] <+Gondab> Is the heartbeat the Zapping system or are they just moving really fast?
[4:51:20] <Zaphire_Saucypants> @Futurecity10 quite a quandary.
[4:51:20] <sadolerlaqreet1> @futurecity10 coom to this stream
[4:51:21] <DuoScratch> why do you only have 30 H.Gun rounds? I thought you had way more.
[4:51:22] <Rexenexus> @Futurecity10 masturbate to Pat's decent into madnes
[4:51:31] <%Faustgesicht> Holy shit Dead Aim's protagonist is Bruce McGivern. what an awful name
[4:51:31] <rcand9> billy is wading through items
[4:51:31] <%natebud> I kind of like that we're showing the worst possible scenario
[4:51:34] <FirearmsInstructor> FUCK
[4:51:40] <%sporeian94> Whatever happened to that Monster Hunter movie they were making...
[4:51:42] <DuoScratch> nvm, asked and answered.
[4:51:43] <ElenaManetta> i just ate mango so cold it tasted like ice cream, awesome
[4:51:49] <+greyfox747> I'm losing my mind just watching this
[4:51:50] <arkv01> @Futurecity10 I'm alreayd playing 5d chess with my pants off while watching the stream
[4:51:50] <Fujiwara_92> NotLikeThis can't wake up
[4:51:51] <%lionandfox21> @Faustgesicht He looks stupid too, its such a dumb game
[4:51:59] <Zaphire_Saucypants> @ElenaManetta nice
[4:52:01] <FirearmsInstructor> @greyfox747 I'm getting actually angry.
[4:52:02] <tealwolf26> Morrowind storage. Stack everything on the floor in giant pillar stacks.
[4:52:05] <%ssjklyco> For a game that came out in the early 2000s when games had that shitty 3D era , they really look better then many games released in 2012
[4:52:12] <ElenaManetta> oH NO IT'S NOT ENOUGH!!!
[4:52:16] <%Faustgesicht> @lionandfox21 HE sure fucking does.
[4:52:18] <tusk102> it's just remake 2 again
[4:52:20] <rcand9> 3 more bosses
[4:52:20] <FirearmsInstructor> I'm getting UPSET that I'm getting UPSET at this dumb bullshit.
[4:52:20] <arkv01> ok so we've got a lotta goo is what you're saying
[4:52:21] <Fujiwara_92> STILL NOT ENOUGHT
[4:52:26] <%W1nterTitan> 12 Molatovs
[4:52:26] <%sporeian94> What are you gonna fight?
[4:52:27] <%BigCoffee> just stop man
[4:52:32] <the_millenial_falcon> How did this game not get way worse reviews? This late game item management is excruciating.
[4:52:40] <%BigCoffee> pick 2-3 weapons and finish the game
[4:52:40] <$GameOverDeo> PogChamp PogChamp
[4:52:52] <mankeytennis> Morrowinds storage is a story related corpse
[4:52:53] <chambatron> Having an elevator to pick up everything and having a locator on your map. to check the items. They fucking knew it would get messy and still did not put the item box in
[4:52:55] <yficaptions> more ammo = less backtracking?
[4:52:59] <%luftraumm1> you're not supposed to carry everything around
[4:53:01] <tusk102> @AngriestPat because the game sucks and enemies besides basic zombies are bastards to deal with and they hate the player?
[4:53:02] <%SirGO0SE> @the_millenial_falcon if memory serves people were still really enamored with the visuals
[4:53:02] <%BigCoffee> thats the plan yfi
[4:53:08] <KaliasTV> Reload the bat boss for extra grenades tho Kappa
[4:53:23] <%BigCoffee> no one plays like Pat does
[4:53:26] <%XeroSigmaPrime> LIterally supposed to be only like 30 min of the game left, but this item shit literally stretches it to 2 hours
[4:53:27] <%lionandfox21> I'm curious about the dev process between this and CVX cause man these games are ROUGH
[4:53:28] <%BigCoffee> you can speedrun this in 2h
[4:53:34] <%natebud> Abandoning the second handgun at the very beginning is probably something the developers didn't expect
[4:53:46] <%sporeian94> #Murica
[4:53:52] <FirearmsInstructor> SAVE
[4:53:54] <%ssjklyco> Look at this game and look at that new current gen Fast and Furious game
[4:53:54] <ElenaManetta> time to beat the game
[4:54:00] <cesare92x> I keep asking my self how can you finish cvx in 4 hours? there's an actual trophy about it
[4:54:00] <%TheMattman1313> So how much game is actually left?
[4:54:00] <ElenaManetta> it's a cakewalk from here
[4:54:02] <Fujiwara_92> time to save
[4:54:05] <FirearmsInstructor> PLEASE GOD
[4:54:06] <+Mittensbro> I GOT A HALL GOT A HALLWAY FULLA GREENHERBS
[4:54:06] <Zaphire_Saucypants> you sure you won't beat the game tonight?
[4:54:09] <Zaphire_Saucypants> we're pretty close
[4:54:11] <arkv01> you're ready for Commando Billy
[4:54:13] <%SirGO0SE> 1 hr left?
[4:54:16] <+lucaflow> So like, why isn't there a box for you to put your shit in?
[4:54:17] <luckycloud91> They should at least give you item pouches
[4:54:19] <Zaphire_Saucypants> aight
[4:54:21] <Fujiwara_92> fucking hel
[4:54:24] <%RubberFistFight> @Zaphire_Saucypants nah he said he's ready to start screaming.
[4:54:24] <%SirGO0SE> temtem?!
[4:54:24] <%luftraumm1> wolf force
[4:54:25] <$GameOverDeo> not with that attitude
[4:54:29] <rcand9> good idea
[4:54:30] <rytisone> coward
[4:54:30] <+Beerswithbears> so is this an art show channel now?
[4:54:32] <%D3rrtyD4n> atpGood
[4:54:34] <arkv01> k TPFufun
[4:54:35] <rcand9> get some rest
[4:54:36] <%theo_marks> temtem to wash away the pain
[4:54:36] <%lionandfox21> @TheMattman1313 Realistically like 30 to 40 mins but it feels longer
[4:54:37] <+PlagueOfGripes> Biwwy
[4:54:39] <%natebud> Sit back, relax, unwind and you will find
[4:54:40] <%Malchiah_Tenabre> beat it then do Temtem
[4:54:41] <mankeytennis> Think you might've overdone it there, Pat.

[4:55:11] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat You didn't wait until the last typewriter keypress. Save didn't take.

[4:57:56] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Pat truly suffers for his art.
[4:58:01] <+LegendaryDorkKnight> honestly this game can be beaten in a sitting calebSM
[4:58:16] <ElenaManetta> ELMO
[4:58:19] <%TheMattman1313> WHAT A HERO
[4:58:21] <%TwinBat> apatWink
[4:58:22] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat If you see this, thank you as always for the stream. I sincerely appreciate it, even if RE0 and CVX made me SUPER UPSET.
[4:58:25] <ElenaManetta> Elmo is a natural born mascot
[4:58:27] <Zaphire_Saucypants> the baby is there to keep you sane
[4:58:27] <%jessedouglas> apatWink apatWink apatWink apatWink apatWink apatWink
[4:58:27] <tusk102> he's like 40 min from beating it lol but also you can tell how much he's suffering and i don't blame him
[4:58:29] <%akumakins> Hello Elmo!
[4:58:30] <+SpoonlessAlakazam> Cat streamer etalWoah
[4:58:30] <FirearmsInstructor> oh he's back
[4:58:30] <ElenaManetta> that's why they make toys out of him
[4:58:32] <%wrightlight94> Elmo so cute apatWink
[4:58:33] <$GameOverDeo> CoolCat
[4:58:39] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> EMLO
[4:58:41] <%akumakins> apatWink
[4:58:44] <%RubberFistFight> HE YAWN
[4:58:47] <arkv01> elmos going to transform into a hot sexy catgirl once the streams done
[4:58:49] <rcand9> 3 bosses to go
[4:58:49] <ElenaManetta> sometimes i forget Elmo is also a Sesame Street character
[4:58:49] <%ssjklyco> c
[4:58:52] <%natebud> screaming angry piss
[4:58:53] <ElenaManetta> I think of the cat by default now
[4:58:59] <%mh9s> apatBlep
[4:59:03] <%lionandfox21> hey Pat though this game sucks, at least we're here together
[4:59:04] <Zaphire_Saucypants> true
[4:59:05] <%WhereIsWill> least you have emlo to ham it up in the camera!
[4:59:07] <trashcansan> he do a jump
[4:59:10] <%poohtrailsnailcooch> Just wait for RE 6
[4:59:10] <%RubberFistFight> @ElenaManetta one of my cats is named Grover and the same thing happens.
[4:59:11] <rcand9> ruined by something so simple
[4:59:13] <%Mindtrick_Matt> Like the Train and the Train
[4:59:14] <%ssjklyco> like Rebecca
[4:59:26] <Fro5tburn> Regular Ass-Tyrant Kreygasm
[4:59:29] <rcand9> billy is cool
[4:59:32] <$GameOverDeo> Ecliptic Express
[4:59:33] <tusk102> @AngriestPat it's far more unbearable without another person in the room to just shoot the shit and make jokes to so you can kinda ignore the shit
[4:59:37] <nademonkey1100> this game has alot going for it its just it has so much that goes against it
[4:59:37] <%SirGO0SE> theres quality there but the game needed another pass so fucking bad
[4:59:39] <ElenaManetta> I think your inventory playstyle hampers the enjoyment more than the average gamer, but an item box should still exist because why not.
[4:59:40] <TalisKanju> Ecliptic Express
[4:59:44] <rcand9> leech men are creepy
[4:59:47] <%natebud> This game has some unique stuff.
[4:59:47] <%Monkeyweed21> Remember the dumb mace hand Tyrant from CVX
[4:59:58] <Zaphire_Saucypants> wat about da leeches, tho @AngriestPat
[5:00:02] <%moranprime> Meanwhile the Resident Evil Outbreak people are running around the dead factory
[5:00:04] <%poohtrailsnailcooch> Rehashed ideas tho
[5:00:07] <King_Wolf_Rigger> I had to step away for a bit, what did I miss? Did Pat win?
[5:00:14] <arkv01> I mean I dunno man, the leech dudes might be surprisingly good in bed
[5:00:15] <yficaptions> baby is baba
[5:00:17] <%ssjklyco> This game leeched the life from him
[5:00:18] <%lionandfox21> I do think the RE series has always given us an interesting match between the two leads
[5:00:18] <tusk102> @AngriestPat would you say the game has cool ideas that are just executed poorly?
[5:00:19] <%nofestu2> bb
[5:00:30] <rcand9> leech guys returned in outbreak
[5:00:36] <TalisKanju> RE0's main problem is that Capcom made a game not long before it that is MUCH better
[5:00:43] <ElenaManetta> the channel points only give me a random sub emote for 24 hours? this is buuullshit i thought it was forever
[5:00:59] <x00Leon> leeches are going to be in the multiplayer for 3
[5:01:02] <trashcansan> what's more iconic: angry flute man from re0 or wooooooo man from sekiro
[5:01:11] <rcand9> remake is soooooooo goood
[5:01:16] <tusk102> OOOOO
[5:01:19] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @ElenaManetta Yeah, same.
[5:01:28] <tusk102> that's a bad move
[5:01:32] <%moranprime> @AngriestPat I remember buying a double pack for REmake and RE0 on the Gamecube
[5:01:41] <ElenaManetta> Two games so close to each other would suggest two different teams, right?
[5:01:42] <%luftraumm1> ohgod
[5:01:47] <%lionandfox21> Really? I remember playing RE0 wayyy after RE1 remake
[5:01:48] <rcand9> remake is an all time classic
[5:01:53] <arkv01> the streams last week wit hthe billy ASMR did wonders for my sleep
[5:02:05] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat after you're done here you should go check out the massive fuck-fire that is the WC3Reforged launch. They cut like 90% of what they promised, and all that's left is new models that they got outsourced from Malaysia, forced over the old engine from the original game. So much salt about it right now.
[5:02:21] <%ssjklyco> RE0 probably was supposed to come out first, but released Remake first to get people familiar with the changes.
[5:02:30] <arkv01> wow, sounds just like the fuckfire that was FF8 Remastered!
[5:02:36] <%nofestu2> COOL
[5:02:37] <%SirGO0SE> wow
[5:02:39] <%TwinBat> LUL
[5:02:40] <%DeeTrz> i pre ordered WC3 reforged :(
[5:02:43] <King_Wolf_Rigger> That sounds like wet butt
[5:02:44] <tusk102> good job blizzard
[5:02:45] <+RenoDeGeneric> How does RE stay good when all the bosses suck?
[5:02:47] <%nofestu2> classic Blizzard
[5:02:52] <ElenaManetta> SWIPE LEFT, ELMO
[5:02:54] <Zaphire_Saucypants> ugh, Blizzard. Tired of their shit.
[5:02:56] <arkv01> its time elmo learn some DISCIPLINE
[5:02:57] <%LaughingCatt> he wish to chomp
[5:02:57] <rcand9> @RubberFistFight wow
[5:02:57] <%Monkeyweed21> What do you think if Mickey Mouse and the Microwave Hallway
[5:02:58] <%CalderGaming> apatGib
[5:02:58] <%RubberFistFight> @D33TR bet you regret that now :P
[5:02:58] <%TwinBat> animal abuse D:
[5:02:59] <WaxWitch> such a way with words PrideGasp
[5:03:01] <+JohnMarkley> kitty <3
[5:03:01] <TalisKanju> What happened to FF8 remastered?
[5:03:01] <%lionandfox21> @AngriestPat Think you'll play through the Silent Hill series now that there's rumor os Konami doing a soft retcon of the series?
[5:03:03] <MachineHead9> he wants to play
[5:03:06] <Captain_Joe1911> :D
[5:03:06] <%luftraumm1> specifically not classic blizzard
[5:03:06] <arkv01> and maybe a little bible (black)
[5:03:08] <trashcansan> @arkv01 wait how bad is the ff8 remake BibeThump
[5:03:10] <Captain_Joe1911> adorable
[5:03:11] <%nofestu2> bb is stronk
[5:03:21] <Jolly_Adventurer> Elmo confirmed at least A tier on power list
[5:03:25] <rytisone> my cat also wants to fight me right now
[5:03:26] <rcand9> ff8 remaster was a total fuck up
[5:03:31] <%akumakins> Guess he'll die
[5:03:31] <%luftraumm1> actually feels like a new Activision blizzard move
[5:03:31] <%CalderGaming> pretty good, 6/10
[5:03:32] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Such art
[5:03:33] <Zaphire_Saucypants> A MASTERPIECE!!!
[5:03:35] <rcand9> so good
[5:03:36] <ElenaManetta> it was heartfelt
[5:03:36] <MachineHead9> very good LUL
[5:03:36] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat it was a true arts.
[5:03:37] <Fujiwara_92> IT WAS PURE ART
[5:03:39] <%SirGO0SE> it belong in a mueseum
[5:03:40] <tealwolf26> Bootiful!!!
[5:03:44] <rcand9> one for the ages
[5:03:44] <%nofestu2> so subversive
[5:03:45] <%Zeahk> It was lit.
[5:03:45] <trashcansan> 100/100
[5:03:46] <%luftraumm1> creative
[5:03:48] <SilverJakler> shake the bag tho
[5:03:49] <BRBN310> it spoke volumes!
[5:03:56] <SMuffinMan> PLUS BILL LEE
[5:03:58] <Zaphire_Saucypants> It MOVED me....to teeears!
[5:04:00] <%peachy996> Inspiring
[5:04:01] <%luftraumm1> creative/art
[5:04:04] <mankeytennis> I can relate
[5:04:17] <%SirGO0SE> thinking of meg from hades
[5:04:18] <arkv01> @trashcansan they updated character and battle enemy models but the world map is fucked up and you can see the polygonal breaks between terrain, and they ran the backgrounds through a blur filter making it look worse than the original running on PS3
[5:04:21] <Arek_1> Elmo broke skin. LUL
[5:04:24] <%akumakins> So smelly
[5:04:24] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @AngriestPat Warcraft 3 Reforged came out... its a trashfire
[5:04:29] <%Aydarkzero> Healers control your life
[5:04:29] <%ssjklyco> Why create a stream tomorrow when you can have someone else make a better RE0 stream and say it's you playing.
[5:04:32] <ElenaManetta> if they let me die i report them bam i win
[5:04:33] <tusk102> @AngriestPat not important because haha anthem but here's a year update of someone who plays the game enough to have all masterworks/legendaries: the game is super improved and they totally reworked the drop rates. also you can totally buy different materials for your armor and they're pretty cheap too you can earn it in like an hour.
[5:04:33] <ElenaManetta> i WIN!
[5:04:34] <%LaughingCatt> or Rescue you off a cliff
[5:04:36] <%luftraumm1> why are hades characters so hot?
[5:04:40] <%natebud> One neat thing. RE0 is the only classic RE game where zombies don't always reset as soon as you leave a room. So you can do things like train zombies to one door with one character and get items witht he other. Unfortunately there's almost no good chances to do this.
[5:04:41] <%RubberFistFight> No no keep mocking the healers, it gives the rest of us a laugh when they just start pretending you don't exist.
[5:04:44] <rumblebunni> Rescue murder inbound.
[5:04:53] <%StaceMcGate> Did Pat beat RE 0?
[5:05:01] <+Estuko> Is stream ending? :(
[5:05:04] <WaxWitch> creothSIP ummhmm
[5:05:18] <ElenaManetta> i'll get my window lock fixed soon... so people don't break into my house
[5:05:21] <ElenaManetta> maybe in another 3 months.
[5:05:22] <%SoFarFetched> He's gonna beat it tomorrow
[5:05:38] <%nofestu2> BUT NO
[5:05:39] <%SirGO0SE> KappaHD KappaHD
[5:05:43] <trashcansan> @arkv01 hearing that breaks my heart because I really don't want to get a playstation 2 just to play the game without my eyes bleeding

[5:06:17] <%poohtrailsnailcooch> Pat sniffs so much that im starting to think he has a cocaine addiction
[5:06:22] <arkv01> @trashcansan the good news is theres a pc mod to fix the world map terrain and they're working on gigapixel HD backgrounds to replace the shitty filtered ones in FF8R

[5:10:57] <shabop> i played 10 mins of witcher 1. combat was too bad
[5:10:58] <%Mindtrick_Matt> I 100% Dragon Age Inquisition and hated myself for it
[5:11:07] <%poohtrailsnailcooch> OKay good to know
[5:11:07] <%TheMattman1313> @AngriestPat The combat controls are really just a rhythm game
[5:11:07] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> and dont forget those TRADING CARDS :D
[5:11:12] <Neo_Kaiser> Steve is the Ustanak.
