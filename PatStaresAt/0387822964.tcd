[0:14:53] <%deadpalvgz> HA
[0:14:53] <+PenmanLupine> Umbral Forma sounds like a Bayonetta transofrmation

[0:16:03] <TaliTenenbaum> @AngriestPat My bf also is a warframe veteran and thinks youre a crazy man for calling frames "dolls" bc lore reasons etc etc nerd shit
[0:16:06] <alttab> twitch ads do weird shit. after ads just rejoin stream
[0:16:17] <starotter70> That makes too much sense
[0:16:18] <$RaikenTB> Paige ded again
[0:16:23] <%Typhaeon> Knowing Smash players, shitting in the shower wouldn't be uncommon
[0:16:24] <+dawsfloss> Paige died and now elmo runs her twitter
[0:16:25] <stabbityrabbit> Oh yeah, that's Melty Blood for you.
[0:16:27] <dekkitout> Crying in the shower has a new definition
[0:16:27] <grayjammer> Tier list Melty Blood > Melee
[0:16:27] <%Laecerelius> Without trying to farm randomly spawning escaped prisoners it's gonna take like 7 weeks at least to get to rank 30
[0:16:29] <%NWR_James> Meltyblood players are not human
[0:16:30] <HerrDemsus> i am more hype about the wolf armor parts and syndana
[0:16:32] <person181> they'll do it there since they never use it
[0:16:35] <DavidSanChan> staring at pats neck dot all night
[0:16:35] <alcors_wisdom> aye caught the start of a stream for once good for me
[0:16:35] <%lewdskeletor13> Paige is dead and Pat is just doing a Weekend at Bernies
[0:16:35] <%Mornaka> cheer500 so an update about the Pat D&D character. Our raptor got eaten by a shadow monster so no more Raptor Knight. Also you got bitten by a master vampire. I'll give you an update if you become a Vampire Knight

[0:16:45] <%Dr00_PhD> SLY COOPER!
[0:16:45] <%nofestu2> All those games rule

[0:16:59] <%yeknomlive> how's the ps4 remake?
[0:16:59] <faldin> spyro is better than crash tbh
[0:16:59] <DracaenaLeaf> Ratchet and Clank 1 was the best
[0:17:00] <%Romulus1213> @AngriestPat Hi Pat
[0:17:01] <Guardiansaiyan> @AngriestPat please get the Spyro and Crash remake Trilogies
[0:17:03] <hntronium> FUCK NO. They can fuck off elsewhere, we Melty Blood players have carefully staked our claim on the Shower Area.
[0:17:04] <FracturedImage> ratchet stream wen?!

[0:17:13] <+BrightOctarine> ratchet and clank 1 didn't have strafing, I think they got better
[0:17:15] <%HentaiSenpai9K> Pat apparently is obsessed with #2
[0:17:16] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Jak and Daxter is halfway between Ratchet and Clank and Mario 64
[0:17:16] <+GoodGuyBuehler> Sly Cooper series was amazing
[0:17:17] <%Typhaeon> Das bass doe
[0:17:19] <%Gray_skies1993> @AngriestPat you unfortunately played the worst Jak game. Jak and Daxter, and Jak 3 are amazing

[0:26:00] <%Gray_skies1993> the soul of melee is the Notorious BIG stand coming for Pat
[0:26:04] <%tinyswampthing> high level melee has an issue with its top 8 becuase its so much of the same people. you rarely see brand new rookies make top 8s in majors
[0:26:06] <%lewdskeletor13> I’d like to be addicted sir
[0:26:07] <%CerberusDriver> I mean melee did nuke itself, because the fanbase sucks and turns everyone against them
[0:26:09] <+ShogunNoonto> its ok
[0:26:10] <Worldbrand> I tried it
[0:26:10] <%gus_hornblende> I have!
[0:26:12] <%Nobrev> I love warframe on the switch
[0:26:15] <+UltraConfused> It's fine
[0:26:15] <Darren716> Its fine
[0:26:15] <MoulesFritz> Nice/
[0:26:15] <%riantDeliration> its p good on Switch, only real hiccups are open worlds
[0:26:16] <%averyoddjew> it's fine
[0:26:16] <%snarf8122> Switch Warframe is up to date as of now
[0:26:17] <%gus_hornblende> It's... neat, but the controls are awkward?
[0:26:18] <%mercado94> its fine. play it in PC
[0:26:18] <Worldbrand> Seems okay but I have a killer PC so
[0:26:18] <Deano8817> It's fine
[0:26:19] <%SaltyDongs> Whatframe?
[0:26:20] <+Diabetic> I play on the Switch, it's very good, it's at 30fps that's the only thing @AngriestPat
[0:26:20] <Caidezes> Panic Button are a bunch of magicians.
[0:26:20] <+iLoveApples14> Its fine, controls are what you would assume
[0:26:21] <thelonechris> Is Warframe like the new MH for Pat?
[0:26:22] <dekkitout> How is it undocked?
[0:26:23] <earth2kev> Not bad
[0:26:24] <krackman245> it's fine
[0:26:25] <%Verd_254> I mean it's free, just try it?
[0:26:25] <goodapollo94> switch warframe is good fpr the most part.
[0:26:27] <Darren716> I saw some drops in open areas
[0:26:29] <%gus_hornblende> I haven't figured how to play it yet, but I WANT to play it on Switch
[0:26:33] <BootyMcScooty> doesnt loom great but its alright

[0:41:32] <+x24sonic> why the fuck would you ever make pals with baby boomers
[0:41:33] <ScreamingMeat> The NCR dogs looks like they haven't eaten in months while the Legion dogs look like well fed wolves

[0:42:05] <joylent_blue> Pat's gay fantasies, as opposed to Woolie's gay fantasies
[0:42:06] <starotter70> lil'boomer
[0:42:10] <%dave323dave> lewd
[0:42:11] <KeiPrime> energy weapons are teh shit
[0:42:13] <thelonechris> Only one arm
[0:42:14] <%kiiiirsten> I think the lack of color has something to do with how soothing the game can be
[0:42:15] <%tinyswampthing> agreed
[0:42:16] <%Das_Bass> this my fave game
[0:42:18] <fruit_pie_the_magician> BUT PAT THE LeSHEN
[0:42:19] <+SickBangerzM9> Modern Bethesda games are relaxing af on a couch with a controller
[0:42:23] <%Gatzarlok> Don't forget to grab the unique grenade launcher while your in there.
[0:42:23] <%lewdskeletor13> Pat is very horny tonight
[0:42:24] <gunzerkingdunce> @joylent_blue brothers fighting shirtless in the rain
[0:42:24] <%SilvaChariot0133> Which arm? 🤔
[0:42:25] <KangarooCyborg> Arm tingling?
[0:42:26] <zeroraider> Dead money won't be relaxing lol
[0:42:26] <+x24sonic> my blood pumping, my left arm tingling, my chest feeling like it's got a belt tightening around it
[0:42:28] <bleugh> new bagels
[0:42:29] <aimlesshealer> Yeah, it's the game doing that sure
[0:42:30] <danknugglit> Like red deads menus LUL
[0:42:30] <gustavozxd> like desert rooms wearing cowboy hats
[0:42:32] <%valriot> Its because theres very little HUD, easy on the eyes
[0:42:34] <%CerberusDriver> the witcher 3 is my relaxation game
[0:42:34] <%Agami23> not as much as dragon quest did
[0:42:36] <+thenoodle007> Stupid shit? Thats why I tune in
[0:42:37] <tacostarvedbeast> this is @AngriestPat favorite game on the citadel
[0:42:37] <$RaikenTB> DansGame
[0:42:38] <%kiiiirsten> Face ass? What?
[0:42:40] <alrobot2014> i listen to podcasts during bethesda games
[0:42:40] <joylent_blue> gunzerkingdunce you know it
[0:42:43] <natebud> boomers, vault 19, ganon, all the casino missions
[0:42:47] <+PenmanLupine> wuss
[0:42:49] <+Bouerd> Dead Money is the second best DLC fight me
[0:42:50] <%Gray_skies1993> Dead Money is fucked
[0:42:50] <BallinArbiter> It’s my favorite game too
[0:42:51] <%kiiiirsten> Are you gonna poon out on the DLC you fucko
[0:42:52] <joylent_blue> i like dead money FeelsBadMan
[0:42:54] <starotter70> what about darkest dungeon?
[0:42:54] <KeiPrime> dead money is fun but yeah i can see why its not everyone's favorite
[0:42:55] <%rdark_ksu> civ is my chil game
[0:42:56] <alrobot2014> dead money is super chill when you know where the speakers and radios are
[0:42:57] <%JayEarly> My one and only cosplay is an NCR Trooper
[0:42:57] <Fujiwara_92> Dragon Age was my relax game OpieOP
[0:42:58] <%TheSpiritof2277> this is second only to Nier in my book, but favorite open world game for sure
[0:42:59] <daisymaisy02> It's my favourite game probably of all time and I have played it five or six times, played it basically the same way every time, and NEVER finished it
[0:43:00] <+BrightOctarine> Grinding relics on FF14 is my relaxation
[0:43:00] <%nofestu2> its the only DLC that sucks
[0:43:00] <%Agami23> subnautica or minecraft for me to chilllllll
[0:43:00] <Darren716> I hate the gameplay of dead money
[0:43:02] <+thenoodle007> Same
[0:43:03] <danknugglit> Witcher 3 Kreygasm
[0:43:03] <%Gameington_IV> bloodborne is my relaxation game
[0:43:03] <keylancer13> dead money = best NV DLC
[0:43:04] <BallinArbiter> It’s story is so good tho
[0:43:04] <rabbi2himself> Bubble Bobble is probably my fav game to relax to.
[0:43:05] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@VerySevereLag) (warning)
[0:43:07] <tacostarvedbeast> shits locked
[0:43:07] <+SickBangerzM9> Im planning on buying skyrim on ps4 just to sit and relax on my bed with a controller
[0:43:08] <Bek_359> Dead Money's biggest problem is the FUCKING speakers
[0:43:08] <$RaikenTB> Hotel Dusk is my relaxation game.
[0:43:10] <%Starlight_Gamer> Never played new vegas... is this game longer than other fallout games?
[0:43:12] <%JayEarly> Dead Money's story and atmosphere is amazing
[0:43:13] <%Wukku> Was Old World blues part of New Vegas?
[0:43:13] <%Dr00_PhD> Swingin around in Spider-man is mine
[0:43:16] <+x24sonic> HOW CAN THIS BE
[0:43:17] <@JustinianKnight> LttP is my 'relax game' every so often
[0:43:17] <%kiiiirsten> Old World Blues is the best DLC and I'll fight all comers
[0:43:18] <prime_name> Digimon Next Order is the biggest comfy game.
[0:43:19] <+Koagz> divinity 2 is my chill game
[0:43:20] <%Nobrev> I play battlefront 2 or titanfall 2 when I want to just chill and get some tunnel vision going
[0:43:21] <%Das_Bass> Old World Blues and Honest Hearts are the really good ones
[0:43:21] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Wish I had a favorite game I could go back to :(
[0:43:22] <zeroraider> FUCK the speakers
[0:43:25] <tacostarvedbeast> WHOSE CLIPPING?!
[0:43:26] <%Mornaka> @Wukku yup
[0:43:26] <milim_nava> Dead Money is underrated tbh, but then again I have a soft spot for areas of a game that strip you of all the shit that makes you powerful and throws you into a difficult situation
[0:43:27] <%CerberusDriver> Blood and Wine's area is so relaxing to walk around, I love that place
[0:43:28] <alrobot2014> there are stairs
[0:43:28] <SubjectX07x> Ya know what makes this game better, mod DLC like New Vegas Bounties. Kappa
[0:43:35] <%kiiiirsten> Get your bitch ass to the Big MT immediately!
[0:43:35] <SpicyCheeseNips> I STILL haven't finished Witcher 3. Even after starting over THREE times.
[0:43:35] <alrobot2014> for your legs
[0:43:37] <%lewdskeletor13> HOW CAN THIS BE
[0:43:38] <+crifff> It is amazing that this game is as good as it is when you can feel the jank just dripping off of it.
[0:43:38] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> oh wait, I do. Def Jam
[0:43:47] <+mjkenney24> does witcher 2 hold up ok? keep wanting to get into the series but i feel like i need to play 2 before 3
[0:43:47] <HefestoForges> terminal
[0:43:50] <gustavozxd> i play any shitty grindy mobile game to relax cause my brain slowly starts to turn off as i play, right now i'm playing that stupid kh game
[0:43:51] <+Xanadirrr> Okami is a chill and a half experience
[0:43:51] <$MetalPanic> does the internet exist in fallout universe?
[0:43:52] <natebud> Dead Money is the DLC with the best story, worst moment to moment gameplay. It's just too linear
[0:43:55] <+SickBangerzM9> The ending is alright
[0:43:58] <+SickBangerzM9> for witcher 3
[0:44:00] <%lewdskeletor13> Red Dead 2 is my relaxation game
[0:44:00] <+Rorinator> Old World Blues > Lonesome Road > Honest Hearts > > > > Dead Money
[0:44:01] <%kiiiirsten> @crifff The bugs are all features
[0:44:02] <%Ahack13> I don't like the combat in Witcher 3
[0:44:03] <%ThatGuyfromMars> I didn't even start blood and wine
[0:44:03] <$RaikenTB> For shame, Patrick.
[0:44:07] <%JayEarly> @crifff Magic of good quest design and writing
[0:44:07] <%nofestu2> Blood and wine is SO GOOD
[0:44:10] <%gus_hornblende> I got half way through Blood & Wine as well.. I REALLY need to finish that
[0:44:11] <Tucker0603> despite being a huge RPG fan, I could never really get into the Witcher games, despite EVERYONE recommending it to me @angriestpat
[0:44:14] <%CerberusDriver> blood and wine is good, yall missing out
[0:44:15] <dukenux> Did you beat Hearts of Stone, @AngriestPat
[0:44:15] <%kiiiirsten> @ThatGuyfromMars apatJpeg
[0:44:15] <%Gray_skies1993> Raul just moonwalking into the stairs
[0:44:17] <+x24sonic> >turns around and dude is just hanging out running into a wall
[0:44:17] <%ThatGuyfromMars> The witcher is such a time sink
[0:44:18] <milim_nava> OWB > Lonesome > Dead Money >>>> Honest Hearts
[0:44:19] <SpicyCheeseNips> I don't think I even have the DLC yet.
[0:44:20] <%PelySux22> apatBig BRAIN
[0:44:23] <danknugglit> Blood and wine is the best part
[0:44:25] <%TheSpiritof2277> Blood and Wine is some real closure for the end-game, loved it
[0:44:26] <cuppa_java_guv> 1000 IQ Pog
[0:44:26] <%Razputin217> SMRT
[0:44:27] <ScreamingMeat> @AngriestPat You should restart Blood and Wine as a Stream
[0:44:29] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @kiiiirsten apatJpeg
[0:44:32] <Fujiwara_92> TOO BIG TOO FAST
[0:44:35] <BallinArbiter> No it’s fine shut up
[0:44:37] <OwlLightningMage> You're playing on easy LUL
[0:44:37] <+FoolsArcade> you missd one
[0:44:37] <alrobot2014> by lvl 26 you become the most op motherfucker
[0:44:37] <%Ahack13> Everything else is so good. But the combat was just not fun to me so I lost interest in the game.
[0:44:37] <Darren716> 1
[0:44:39] <%CJett92> missed one
[0:44:43] <%ItsKitKat_> Honest Hearts is the best. I love Joshua Graham
[0:44:45] <%king_wragles> MISSED
[0:44:46] <%Das_Bass> Honest Hearts has the best character
[0:44:48] <rabbi2himself> Missed one
[0:44:48] <%lewdskeletor13> Can I start at Witcher 3?
[0:44:51] <%kiiiirsten> Where's our BLIND emote
[0:44:54] <Bek_359> it's a lot more balanced than Fallout 3, where you got enough skill points to max out EVERYTHING
[0:44:54] <%Verd_254> explain
[0:44:55] <+Bupkis7> 1
[0:44:55] <%kiiiirsten> Give the people what they want
[0:44:58] <Worldbrand> Yeah i wasnt the biggest fan of that either
[0:44:59] <Ser_Randal> Thats the best part thio
[0:45:00] <%Faustgesicht> the maze?
[0:45:02] <%Das_Bass> also the 50cal AR10
[0:45:03] <%ThatGuyfromMars> I wish I could like the Witcher 3, but it's such a timesink and I really don't understand what's going on in the story
[0:45:04] <BallinArbiter> That’s correct
[0:45:05] <$philoboy123> wasn't that hard of a riddle Pat
[0:45:05] <evbites> if we had robobrain technology pat would be finally satisfied
[0:45:09] <danknugglit> Its super easy LUL
[0:45:09] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @lewdskeletor13 Kinda. At least watch a run through summary of 2
[0:45:17] <thelonechris> Kappa
[0:45:17] <%madhattergay> !uptime
[0:45:17] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 45m 19s.
[0:45:18] <dukenux> oh
[0:45:20] <%valriot> I solved that riddle like HOURS before i got there
[0:45:20] <%JayEarly> The DLC really breaks the skill system of NV
[0:45:21] <natebud> Now that we're getting to the end and you'll be swimming in skill points, which skill will you refuse to max out?
[0:45:23] <%SaltyDongs> what
[0:45:24] <gustavozxd> danganronpa problems LUL
[0:45:25] <%kiiiirsten> I've never played any of the Witcher games
[0:45:27] <Agalladorn> oh man you're so wrong saying it sucks. that's the whole point of the "riddle", even if you know the answer he isn't gonna play fair
[0:45:28] <+SickBangerzM9> Dialogue boxes are a bitch
[0:45:30] <SpicyCheeseNips> Ohhhh. It's one of THOSE quests.
[0:45:31] <%TheSpiritof2277> that was a cake walk man
[0:45:32] <%ThePuddingDead> What up Nerds!
[0:45:37] <ScreamingMeat> Or you can just let what's his name die
[0:45:39] <%madhattergay> cool got here early
[0:45:39] <%Gray_skies1993> I think regardless of which New Vegas DLC everyone likes best, I think it goes to show that they're all pretty good in their own right because everyone has a different one as favorite, with valid points
[0:45:39] <Caidezes> Blind.
[0:45:41] <+IrishWeegee> so a phoenix wright game?
[0:45:41] <$DrZicter> @AngriestPat hey did you see that video where New Vegas was retextured by a neural network?
[0:45:42] <danknugglit> You can totally cheat with witcher vision
[0:45:42] <tacostarvedbeast> 1 ato second
[0:45:45] <Gorgen> i found it easily
[0:45:46] <helpmeimafruit> The Ace Attorney problem
[0:45:47] <+PenmanLupine> the skill system in NV actually kind of turns me off of the game since everything is so easy to max out
[0:45:47] <+Tadashi047> it was easy to find
[0:45:49] <+Bustamente> Both
[0:45:49] <%CerberusDriver> @AngriestPat did you see V's new taunt where it plays Flight of the Valkyries and he pretends to be a conducter.
[0:45:50] <%Verd_254> apatLiz
[0:45:52] <+paladinstarbuster> @AngriestPat Are you ever going back to Dragon Quest? maybe when the ultimate version comes out. It has both music tracks.
[0:45:52] <Fujiwara_92> the name of that is blindness
[0:45:52] <%kiiiirsten> @Gray_skies1993 But fuck lonesome road tho right?
[0:45:53] <$cureneckbeard> pa smart
[0:45:53] <%gus_hornblende> @lewdskeletor13 Yeah, I think so Witcher storylines are setup like short-stories where it spouts off places and people like you know them, even if you don't. Even the first book was like that
[0:45:53] <Ser_Randal> Pat looked ahead during that part
[0:45:57] <$cureneckbeard> pat smart.
[0:45:58] <%bars_l> thats the point pat
[0:46:02] <dukenux> Dude look it up
[0:46:02] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @kiiiirsten I like lonesome road
[0:46:04] <%bars_l> its an easy riddle
[0:46:06] <+PenmanLupine> so there's like no point to the system when you can just do what you want whenever you want with no challenge
[0:46:07] <%bars_l> hes just fucking with you
[0:46:08] <%Plague_Nurse> apatJpeg
[0:46:08] <VRNK> it actually looks kinda nice, from the screenshots
[0:46:13] <$DrZicter> @AngriestPat I already did like a day ago you bastard
[0:46:14] <VRNK> id play
[0:46:14] <%kiiiirsten> @ThatGuyfromMars Goddamnit, you!
[0:46:15] <%Gray_skies1993> @kiiiirsten that one is actually my favorite lol
[0:46:17] <BallinArbiter> Pat have your ever played morrowind?
[0:46:18] <%PelySux22> im playing onimusha, man fuck that water trap sliding puzzle
[0:46:19] <natebud> It just turns NV into a psychadelic fever dream
[0:46:20] <RetributionP> thanks for dancing around it I'm actually replaying witcher 3. never touched the dlc
[0:46:27] <dukenux> It prolly looks like mojave on peyote
[0:46:27] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Fisto
[0:46:28] <%JayEarly> Honest Hearts is my least favorite but it is a pretty place
[0:46:28] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @kiiiirsten IT'S FUN ALRIGHT
[0:46:29] <%kiiiirsten> @Gray_skies1993 Traitorous dogs, all a'ya!

[1:19:28] <%DK_Rance> *** is a scumbag
[1:19:28] <%ThatGuyfromMars> his voice acting is the best in the game
[1:19:29] <%MelBrooksKA> Why are they storing munitions in their power station?
[1:19:31] <%lewdskeletor13> Like a huge prick
[1:19:33] <zebexter> Mr. House has got that big dick energy
[1:19:37] <%kiiiirsten> @ThatGuyfromMars True, I love House
[1:19:38] <supervyxen> pat likes the brotherhood for no reason
[1:19:41] <callsigneagle01> I also loved how they're in Nellis AFB, since it's another real place
[1:19:41] <Tucker0603> house is a cunt
[1:19:42] <%SpamKingRathalos> Jealous House beat ya to immortality first?
[1:19:43] <TechDragon_Z> Mr. House is best route

[1:19:54] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Doesn't basically call you a retard
[1:19:55] <Darren716> yeah House is totally right about the brotherhood though
[1:19:55] <Fujiwara_92> Mr house is just Stark Senior... Like literally so... OpieOP
[1:19:55] <callsigneagle01> TBH I think Nellis, NV, and Hoover Dam are the only real life places in the game
[1:19:59] <%valkuma> LIE
[1:19:59] <+Cavumentum> Mr. House has the literal smallest dick energy possible aside from Caesar and Vulpes
[1:20:01] <evbites> ***'s life sucks being in a tube like that being able to see your withering body
[1:20:02] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @kiiiirsten I love listening to him talk, even though he's subtly trying to manipulate me with caps

[1:20:50] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @kiiiirsten You and I are of a different stripe, you see? We don't have to dream that we're important, WE ARE. That, and another line in Dead Money, are my favorite lines in the entire game

[1:31:36] <%TheNewJapanGuy> So is RedBull Pat
[1:31:37] <%Remery_> Elmo isn't afraid of death
[1:31:37] <PSI_Guy95> Emlo has his sources for his own hair
[1:31:39] <%Gray_skies1993> @ElenaManetta aren't Deathclaws originally Jackson's Chameleons? those aren't insects
[1:31:39] <zebexter> Elmo will eat your beard
[1:31:39] <MKUltima> Is that what happened to Pat
[1:31:40] <%lewdskeletor13> @boo_the_spacehamster Welcome apatDab

[1:31:46] <+emperri> pat I know it makes you really happy to drink red bulls but it's bad for you
[1:31:47] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Just shave him
[1:31:52] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat the best way to get Elmo off his hair habit is by replacing it with bourbon!
[1:31:52] <Kaitepaints> Why does he have to ask for permission to eat his own hair?
[1:31:58] <aiyobro> i use a flea comb
[1:32:00] <%Plague_Nurse> drink Water
[1:32:01] <boo_the_spacehamster> Thanks lewdskeletor13!
[1:32:07] <%ElenaManetta> Cat has no hair, makes you more sick
[1:32:08] <+x24sonic> ok listen i was trying to make a joke that he speaks spanish because he just added "o" to the end of english words
[1:32:10] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Oh
[1:32:14] <starotter70> I can't believe Paige would do something like that
[1:32:15] <InugamiTheHound> why is that, pat?
[1:32:17] <Kaitepaints> Why?
[1:32:20] <$RaikenTB> Yeah but shave him anyway.
[1:32:22] <%DK_Rance> huh
[1:32:22] <%Wallabri> the dander is being held within the fur
[1:32:22] <%Das_Bass> how?
[1:32:23] <PSI_Guy95> the hair insulates the cat from the pat
[1:32:25] <+MechaBaphomet> TOXO
[1:32:27] <%bevyrage> pat you get sick all the time already
[1:32:30] <%mayorrev> Why are you allergic to cats?
[1:32:32] <zebexter> nakey Elmo
[1:32:33] <PSI_Guy95> no why are you more allergic to bald cat
[1:32:33] <dekkitout> Eat his hair to gain an immunity?
[1:32:34] <%Wallabri> no fur, no barrier
[1:32:37] <Fujiwara_92> that makes no sense pat
[1:32:37] <Kaitepaints> Nah uh
[1:32:37] <%Gray_skies1993> ! TOXIN !
[1:32:38] <%Jjrossman> Dammit Railith
[1:32:39] <thelonechris> Would shaving him make it less likely for you to have a reaction?
[1:32:40] <%Mr_Strut> Then wouldn't shaving him make you less sick? Because less hair?
[1:32:40] <+KanjiTatsumi> You'd have a stronger reaction to him without his hair?
[1:32:40] <balquisa> Then let him do what he wants,dad
[1:32:43] <%king_wragles> Have you tried not being allergic? That might help
[1:32:43] <godzookylives> Just stop being allergic Pat
[1:32:44] <$cureneckbeard> allergic to cats *pets elmo 100 times per day*
[1:32:44] <%lewdskeletor13> Just stop being allergic Pat
[1:32:45] <%mayorrev> I know but WHY
[1:32:46] <%ElenaManetta> But how does him having NO hair trigger it
[1:32:47] <%madhattergay> wouldnt his dander affect you regardless?
[1:32:49] <+x24sonic> eat elmo to tf into your fursona
[1:32:55] <$cureneckbeard> Pat isn't fat, he's swollen from his cat allergy
[1:32:55] <andersonllj92> toxoplasmosis
[1:32:56] <%Spydurman> it's because you hate Earth Day
[1:32:56] <+MechaBaphomet> just stop though
[1:32:56] <%mayorrev> just stop being allergic dude
[1:32:58] <%Das_Bass> its a debuff @AngriestPat
[1:32:58] <+x24sonic> what the fuck did i just write
[1:33:04] <thelonechris> Cat Spores
[1:33:07] <%Gray_skies1993> DANDER
[1:33:10] <zebexter> Establish your dominance by eating the hair in front of him
[1:33:10] <+emperri> Pat have you seen the new $24 mount in FFXIV
[1:33:10] <%ThatGuyfromMars> SPORES
[1:33:12] <%TheSpiritof2277> Just don't fix your biology, man
[1:33:12] <C_S_N_G> Dead skin
[1:33:15] <evbites> elmo dust
[1:33:17] <+emperri> Fatter Cat
[1:33:19] <arkv01> you mean the doggoplasmosis
[1:33:19] <%king_wragles> cat spores = cat dust = cat dander
[1:33:19] <Estuko> monkaS Elmo emits poisonous spores
[1:33:19] <callsigneagle01> Elmo is basically a potential bioweapon
[1:33:25] <Fujiwara_92> Cats are Fungi ppl, so spores OpieOP
[1:33:28] <+KanjiTatsumi> Oh, I guess that makes sense
[1:33:29] <%Gray_skies1993> ULTIMATE BIOWEAPON
[1:33:30] <%lewdskeletor13> Cat dust from the Thanos snap
[1:33:31] <PSI_Guy95> ok so the cat fur literally insulates the deadly spores
[1:33:32] <dukenux> Elmo is the ULtimat BIOwepon
[1:33:33] <thelonechris> So it would be like the Last of Us
[1:33:33] <callsigneagle01> just like Last of Us
[1:33:34] <%MagickBurritoh> ELMO DUST
[1:33:35] <%AmaniIsYourBoss> So you're saying Elmo's a mushroom.
[1:33:35] <balquisa> Cat Spores like from Last of Us. It will turn us all into cat-zombies
[1:33:35] <%Mugentech> Pat is living on the edge 24/7
[1:33:36] <%PlainSimpleTailor> You just need to build up your constitution. Also Cat Dander is SUPER NOT GOOD for PC fans
[1:33:36] <%ryome> "Imagine the cat's fur, as a chain-link fence..."
[1:33:38] <Smaenus> A weapon to surpass Metal Gear
[1:33:39] <%PelySux22> Elmo's a clicker
[1:33:39] <$Order_of_Mystery> 24sonic, wut
[1:33:40] <%rdark_ksu> stun spore?
[1:33:40] <$cureneckbeard> ohh. cat dandruff
[1:33:41] <+Blankets_and_Tea> elmo sounds like the ULTimate BIOwepun
[1:33:41] <%BonewheelVanguard> Could go to a groomer
[1:33:42] <%homelesstwinky> cat residue
[1:33:42] <+x24sonic> holy shit it is just like last of us
[1:33:42] <%Plague_Nurse> So, Elmo is G
[1:33:43] <%ElenaManetta> That's what that move is called...
[1:33:45] <JJMR322> inhale all the dust to become inmune
[1:33:45] <%Mr_Strut> Sniffly spore?
[1:33:47] <energywarning> i understood that reference
[1:33:47] <%ReallyRedRum> I fully believe that under 5 pounds of fur, Elmo is just a vibrating mushroom
[1:33:47] <BaronVonDickButt> Elmo= ULTIMATE BIOWEAPON
[1:33:47] <+KanjiTatsumi> vineHard GRAH
[1:33:48] <dukenux> GAH
[1:33:49] <Goldenwolf98> Nice Digimon reference Pat Kappa
[1:33:50] <%TheSpiritof2277> GRAH
[1:33:50] <%LogothX> stun spore
[1:33:51] <%ElenaManetta> Snifflyspore, he learns it at level 16
[1:33:51] <+Archnos> he would be a weapon to surpass Metal Gear
[1:33:51] <godzookylives> Elmo is the ULTIMATE BIOWEAPON
[1:33:51] <+Jonesman64> someone needs to draw a hairy venasaur
[1:33:52] <Worldbrand> The hair is holding him back
[1:33:53] <$cureneckbeard> Oh I get it
[1:33:54] <stropbopadopolis> penisaur
[1:33:54] <%mercado94> Stun spore, sleep spore and worry seed
[1:33:55] <+emperri> element of surprise
[1:33:55] <%Das_Bass> Cazdors
[1:33:56] <$RaikenTB> GRAH
[1:33:56] <starotter70> What
[1:33:57] <%violetheart> But Pat, the Fur Coat ability would just make Venusaur stronger.
[1:33:57] <+arancet> you can't contain lmos power!
[1:33:58] <TurboMuffin89> benussaur cat
[1:34:00] <dekkitout> Thick Fat, iirc
[1:34:01] <Kaitepaints> How do you know this?
[1:34:01] <dukenux> WutFace
[1:34:02] <%king_wragles> Raul took damage from Pat's words.
[1:34:02] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Elmo is a Parasect. He's the mushroom and you're the host @AngriestPat
[1:34:02] <%madhattergay> this is starting to sound like some kinda fetish
[1:34:03] <%Wukku> Cazdors man
[1:34:04] <%rdark_ksu> he has fucking chapts!
[1:34:05] <%valkuma> CAZADORS are really spooky strong
[1:34:07] <dukenux> Fucking murder flies
[1:34:07] <%Gray_skies1993> GOD THEY"RE SO FAST
[1:34:07] <%Das_Bass> demon bugs
[1:34:08] <thebakaliyen> shave Elmo and throw him at a burglar for poison status
[1:34:09] <%lewdskeletor13> He yelled to assert his dominance
[1:34:09] <dukenux> i HATE THEM
[1:34:10] <thelonechris> Hey look, your best friends are back
[1:34:10] <helpmeimafruit> so the takeaway from this is that elmo can use solar beam
[1:34:11] <ShichiNoBushi> Stun Spore gives the Paralyzed status. Sniffly Spore gives the Sniffly status.
[1:34:18] <InugamiTheHound> oh fuck these bugs
[1:34:20] <%valachi> !WOOZY!
[1:34:21] <DSD24> The worst sound effect in this game

[1:34:34] <%valachi> Cazadors are EZ if you just shoot their wings
[1:34:34] <nooblord_derpington> CoolCat dust
[1:34:35] <%Gray_skies1993> thankfully, just shoot the wings and you're good
[1:34:36] <giga_bit> You feel a little woozy.
[1:34:38] <%TheSpiritof2277> w o o z y
[1:34:40] <InugamiTheHound> raul is KO, use phoenix down on him
[1:34:41] <%madhattergay> worse than nightstalkers
[1:34:41] <Estuko> One time I tried to attack the cazadores with a fatman and one of them snuck up on me and in my panic and terror I accidentally blew us up shooting veronica with it point blank
[1:34:45] <zebexter> woozy go up
[1:34:47] <%PelySux22> its fiiiine
[1:34:49] <evbites> whay are butterflys so strong
[1:34:51] <thebakaliyen> @ShichiNoBushi I imagine that woul d do the same thing as paralyze, where he can't attack every so often because of Sneeze
[1:34:53] <%Gray_skies1993> @Estuko 10/10
[1:34:53] <+MechaBaphomet> has pat done any DLC's yet?
[1:34:55] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Any game designers that put abnormally large insects/arachnids into their game can officially jump off a ten story roof
[1:34:59] <callsigneagle01> bugs are evil
[1:35:01] <dukenux> Why don't you make one of these automatic antivenom things
[1:35:03] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @Estuko and so you went into the pages of history
[1:35:03] <FracturedImage> Pat has not started any DLC yet
[1:35:06] <$RaikenTB> WutFace
[1:35:06] <TurboMuffin89> fuck bugs
[1:35:07] <starotter70> Oh fuck that
[1:35:08] <Coystick> Elmo nests. he's near...
[1:35:09] <helpmeimafruit> what about bugs that wake up to justice
[1:35:10] <%ReallyRedRum> take antivenom to escape the effect of cat spores
[1:35:10] <%Remery_> what about bug girls?
[1:35:13] <zebexter> moths are cute though
[1:35:15] <Worldbrand> bugs are great
[1:35:25] <t0hub0hu> arthropods are dope
[1:35:26] <callsigneagle01> moths r okay
[1:35:26] <DSD24> What about Monster Girl bugs like Rachnea from Monster Musume
[1:35:26] <%lewdskeletor13> Kiwami Bug girls
[1:35:26] <%Gray_skies1993> you mean the massive GRAVEYARD fort?

[1:35:29] <Estuko> @ThatGuyfromMars I went all over the wasteland with that kinda death lmfao
[1:35:29] <%AdmiralButtloaf> reminds me of Noctis and Prompto talking about how icky bugs are
[1:35:29] <InugamiTheHound> what's the name of that fear that makes you hate holes
[1:35:31] <aiyobro> what lol
[1:35:31] <dukenux> Ladybugs are fine too i guess
[1:35:33] <dekkitout> Harpooooon GivePLZ
[1:35:35] <stropbopadopolis> just think of bugs as tiny robots it helps
[1:35:36] <starotter70> Kiwami means Bug Porn

[1:35:47] <InugamiTheHound> honey bees are good I guess
[1:35:51] <%madhattergay> @AngriestPat did you know cazadors were genetically enigineered on purpose?
[1:35:53] <Gorgen> drink a Killer Whale to help you see
[1:35:53] <%Gray_skies1993> PLANE CHAN

[1:35:58] <dukenux> Honey bees are great
[1:35:58] <thebakaliyen> @starotter70 Anthropromorphic bug porn*
[1:35:59] <Worldbrand> y'all were just conditioned to find bugs gross because people who like bugs are gross by association
[1:36:00] <%kiiiirsten> thar she blows
[1:36:01] <ShichiNoBushi> @thebakaliyen I remember that Earthbound had a Cold status. What did that do?
[1:36:02] <%lewdskeletor13> FUCK THAT PLANE
[1:36:10] <$RaikenTB> Nah it's fine. The paint is intact.
[1:36:11] <+x24sonic> fuck them kids
[1:36:14] <callsigneagle01> @AngriestPat they actually pulled a crash B-17 from WW2 out of some greenland ice and got it to fly again
[1:36:15] <%Edgy_Macaroon> it looks really small
[1:36:16] <Coystick> Imagine if Hornet was a Cazadore in Hollow Knight
[1:36:17] <Desertfishing> under the wing
[1:36:19] <+megabman> bags under the wings
[1:36:19] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @kiiiirsten ಠ_ಠ
[1:36:23] <%Romulus1213> blind pat is blind
[1:36:24] <+KanjiTatsumi> You put them on the video game ghost objects under the wings
[1:36:27] <scritchez> freedom doesn't rust though
[1:36:28] <aiyobro> Cold made you skip a turn maybe
[1:36:30] <dukenux> Attach Ballsack
[1:36:31] <callsigneagle01> I forget the news article or year but it was impressive
[1:36:31] <%pyurient> trypaphobia @InugamiTheHound
[1:36:35] <%lewdskeletor13> Pat is having performance issue fucking this plane
[1:36:36] <PSI_Guy95> the ghosts of ballasts yet to come are guiding you
[1:36:38] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> WW2 wasn't 300 years ago
[1:36:40] <thebakaliyen> @ShichiNoBushi it was a very weak poison
[1:36:42] <DSD24> If you were an Argonian this wouldn't be a problem
[1:36:42] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@Estuko) (warning)
[1:36:44] <%kiiiirsten> @ThatGuyfromMars apatSmug
[1:36:46] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> But viddy games whatever
[1:36:50] <stropbopadopolis> you couldnt attack sometimes with a cold
[1:36:51] <+MechaBaphomet> subnatica
[1:36:51] <zebexter> That's a sexy plane
[1:36:52] <%TheSpiritof2277> ye
[1:36:53] <natebud> There's that underwater cave
[1:36:54] <callsigneagle01> eh
[1:36:55] <PSI_Guy95> remember, always explore all deep sea caves
[1:36:55] <Estuko> B 17 Boooooomberrrrrrrr! -AVGN
[1:36:56] <dukenux> Oh no, The Shape of Water
[1:36:58] <nooblord_derpington> Realistically it'd probably be torn apart from a retrieval like this
[1:36:59] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @kiiiirsten apatLiz
[1:37:04] <aiyobro> the water is surprisingly clear

[1:37:07] <callsigneagle01> You can get anything to work with enough work put into it
[1:37:08] <Smaenus> I didn't know about this cave after like thousands of hours, fuck
[1:37:11] <%rdark_ksu> lets say it can be salvaged. The amount of fucking resources would be astronomical

[1:37:41] <aiyobro> why are mushrooms growing underwater?
[1:37:43] <Estuko> @cappyd33 I knew of this, I just had an awful fear of deep dark waters LUL
[1:37:43] <$cureneckbeard> yeyeye grab those alchemy reagents
[1:37:43] <PSI_Guy95> noone will notice it's a skyrim cave if it's flooded
[1:37:44] <%ElenaManetta> I wish we could've evolved with lungs and gills
[1:37:45] <%ryome> ah yes, the skyrim shopping carts!

[1:38:15] <+x24sonic> walking sucks
[1:38:16] <$philoboy123> NV predates Skyrim
[1:38:16] <starotter70> That's why we need to fuck more fish
[1:38:16] <callsigneagle01> Or you could be that guy from Water World
[1:38:18] <%violetheart> Subnautica looks worse than I remember it...

[1:38:31] <callsigneagle01> fuck everything
[1:38:31] <t0hub0hu> breath through our skin like quite
[1:38:31] <%MelBrooksKA> @ElenaManetta Then you'd have to deal with the eldritch horrors of the deep tho
[1:38:31] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Yeah, but then if someone pees swimming in front of you, you die
[1:38:32] <Estuko> @Gray_skies1993 do you still feel your character bumping into the floor's collision at high speeds like speed bumps? LUL
[1:38:34] <%laserbeaming> Those are Skyrim Mushrooms. For Alchemy
[1:38:36] <BaronVonDickButt> @AngriestPat are you gonna concider a Skyrim stream when your done with NV?
[1:38:36] <godzookylives> I wish I was a gill-man BibleThump
[1:38:38] <zebexter> stick a finger in some gills
[1:38:40] <WoRabbit> how is that book even together?
[1:38:43] <%madhattergay> @AngriestPat did you know that cazadors were created on purpose?
[1:38:43] <%ReallyRedRum> That Lad's Life is made of plastic
[1:38:44] <$RaikenTB> Like Kevin Costner?
[1:38:44] <giga_bit> perfectly legible magazine
[1:38:48] <aimlesshealer> Put that on your tombstone, "look at this dead idiot"
[1:38:50] <%Gray_skies1993> @Estuko oh yeah, all the time lmao
[1:38:51] <helpmeimafruit> Is there any hope at all for Elder Scrolls VI?
[1:38:54] <%PlainSimpleTailor> let Skyrim die already
[1:38:57] <callsigneagle01> @RaikenTB Stop reminding me of that movie damnit!
[1:38:57] <%ElenaManetta> Humans WOULD be the horrors of the deep sea. Cthulhu can't deal with bullshit we made in Soma!
[1:39:05] <$RaikenTB> @callsigneagle01 LUL
[1:39:07] <dukenux> Where are the all fish folk?
[1:39:13] <dekkitout> Literal weaponized bees!
[1:39:14] <natebud> There is another underwater cave with stuff
[1:39:14] <Estuko> @Gray_skies1993 do you remember that arrow -> item duplication glitch LUL for consoles if I recalled
[1:39:15] <%ElenaManetta> Imagine muggings deep in the ocean
[1:39:17] <%Das_Bass> "they can't escape"
[1:39:18] <callsigneagle01> God and then there was the Smokers
[1:39:19] <%luckysteak> they are as sterile as they are docile!
[1:39:19] <t0hub0hu> caszadors are oversized tarantula hawks
[1:39:22] <zebexter> where are the fish tiddies
[1:39:24] <42nfl19> oh...I thought pat was cheating with noclip/fly. but he is just under water
[1:39:24] <%madhattergay> he also made the nightstalkers
[1:39:26] <PSI_Guy95> didn't people make super awful african-american honey bees that sting and hate everything
[1:39:28] <DSD24> Someone was like "This will turn out fine!" when making Cazadors
[1:39:31] <%king_of_the_skies_dom> Deathclaws predate the war
[1:39:32] <Worldbrand> What's the deal with cazadors? we use parasitoid braconid wasps for pest control of aphids and caterpillars.
[1:39:36] <%Gray_skies1993> @Estuko I remember it, but I never used it tbh
[1:39:39] <PSI_Guy95> by breeding two bee types and hoping for the best, and then they escaped and then they fucked everyone up
[1:39:42] <%ThatGuyfromMars> raul is stuck in a wall
[1:39:43] <+Grayhammatter> breathing is for squares
[1:39:46] <PSI_Guy95> are cazadors just those with FEV or something
[1:39:51] <%Gray_skies1993> ROCK blocks your path

[1:40:06] <%homelesstwinky> gillbois
[1:40:07] <aimlesshealer> The rock is blocking your path because it has low self-esteem

[1:51:28] <%Keeble24> @lewdskeletor13 "You've 'yeed' your last 'haw'" lol
[1:51:32] <dukenux> Hey, if you're stuck on a praire for weeks, the only optional holes are either your fellow cowboys or cows

[1:51:57] <%madhattergay> Fuck you ***
[1:51:59] <%BonewheelVanguard> Now watch as Pat gains Bad Company.
[1:52:01] <$RaikenTB> People are selling their pre-orders for 76 canvas bags LUL
[1:52:01] <natebud> It's a floppy chip
[1:52:01] <reinbachthe3rd> The ballistic fist is one of my favorite weapons. Those Praetorian always tear face with them.
[1:52:02] <%Nedlin> Odo*
[1:52:03] <dekkitout> @dukenux Is that why cow-girls are a thing?
[1:52:06] <giga_bit> this walt disney looking motherfucker
[1:52:06] <Kaitepaints> Dad?
[1:52:09] <+SuichiTanaka> Somehow I never realized it was Odo
[1:52:12] <supervyxen> house is the best choice for the mojave
[1:52:12] <hamfamjam> Andrew Ryan?
[1:52:13] <Nyemmers> nice house mr house
[1:52:13] <%lewdskeletor13> He’s just so arrogant, and not in the fun way
[1:52:14] <%Meme_Platinum> did somebody say cowgirls?
[1:52:15] <%laserbeaming> You doing House Always Wins?
[1:52:19] <%xS1D3SW1P3x> I only like House cause he's voiced by Odo

[1:52:33] <dukenux> i don't know, but i thank god for cowgirls
[1:52:33] <joylent_blue> "i like my Dante's chaps assless"
[1:52:44] <%laserbeaming> Yes Man is the only choice
[1:52:50] <%Gray_skies1993> @laserbeaming I think he is, to a point though, because he hates House
[1:52:50] <evbites> that dino was meh our dante is big jojo cowboy man
[1:52:50] <%Keeble24> House looks like Howard Stark from Marvel
[1:52:52] <%ThatGuyfromMars> Mr. House for life
[1:52:53] <%CerberusDriver> old dante was gay cowboy, our dante is edgy cool
[1:52:54] <PSI_Guy95> cool radiation
[1:52:55] <%lewdskeletor13> Dante could get it KappaPride
[1:52:56] <$RaikenTB> MrDestructoid
[1:52:56] <callsigneagle01> Man, thank God I was born in this time and not Rome or Greece
[1:52:58] <%kiiiirsten> Yes Man was the way I went my first playthrough
[1:52:59] <%CerberusDriver> DMC5 gives Dante a fucking cowboy hat
[1:53:01] <callsigneagle01> That would've sucked ass
[1:53:04] <%CerberusDriver> just lean right into it
[1:53:08] <DSD24> The Cowgirl in Monster Musume is a cute one
[1:53:09] <natebud> The entire problem with house is just a personality problem. All he had to do was tone down the sarcasm
[1:53:10] <%cappyd33> how
[1:53:10] <%TheSpiritof2277> Old Dante being a gay-cowboy is the only lore I want
[1:53:11] <$cureneckbeard> FISTO NO
[1:53:13] <zebexter> @cerberusdriver give Dante jiggle physics
[1:53:14] <TurboMuffin89> HACKEMANS

[1:56:38] <%cappyd33> pat would you kindly beat *** with a 9-iron
[1:56:38] <+army_of_flies> You can just kill house
[1:56:39] <Darren716> The brotherhood chapter deserves to die
[1:56:39] <%lewdskeletor13> He saved it so he could have his own personal fiefdom
[1:56:39] <balquisa> Except he wants you to kill the BOS without being instigated
[1:56:41] <%BonewheelVanguard> Never bet on the House
[1:56:42] <zebexter> Mr House saved Vegas so we could all get that big nut

[1:57:00] <starotter70> Take Mr House out to lunch
[1:57:02] <Conky89> I went with NCR and honestly, the endings for many characters did not seem that bad.
[1:57:02] <%Das_Bass> I love killing the BOS
[1:57:05] <%valachi> BoS murder people for their tech
[1:57:07] <Kaitepaints> OoooOoOOoooh, I thought y’all were talking about house from the TV show
[1:57:07] <BaronVonDickButt> @AngriestPat you think your going to finish the game tonight?
[1:57:10] <%Keeble24> the BOS are pretty much assholes in every Fallout
[1:57:10] <Estuko> BOS are dicks, fuck em. I'll take their jacket tho lol
[1:57:14] <%lewdskeletor13> @silvcrest That’s a bad mark on his character and motives
[1:57:18] <FracturedImage> BOS are really cunty in this game
[1:57:19] <$Comradeiota> I think "fuck the legion" is a pretty accepted stance
[1:57:20] <%TheSpiritof2277> I only disagree with him about wiping out the BoS because of Veronica. Otherwise I wouldn't care
[1:57:25] <Darren716> Hell the only good BoS member has a quest about leaving them behind
[1:57:28] <DSD24> DLC as well
[1:57:28] <%valachi> @Keeble24 Except for the bad fallout in DC
[1:57:28] <KeystoneA1> Like the DLCs
[1:57:29] <steelplatedog> what smells like piss in ere
[1:57:31] <jabu__jabu> PENTHOUSE FLOORRR
[1:57:31] <%Das_Bass> you dont need to ask me to kill the BOS. I do it for fun
[1:57:32] <JJMR322> finish the game you coward
[1:57:34] <ScreamingMeat> @AngriestPat have you decided which DLC you'd like to do first yet?
[1:57:34] <reinbachthe3rd> I like the BoS, but they're basically always xenophobic douchers. '
[1:57:35] <supervyxen> Veronica is fucking awesome but the Brotherhood sucks ass
[1:57:36] <$cureneckbeard> pent house
[1:57:36] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> "BOS are dicks who murder, so murder them back." GGs chat
[1:57:37] <%ElenaManetta> i need to shower
[1:57:39] <%ElenaManetta> but it's freezing
[1:57:42] <%ThatGuyfromMars> just get the mod so house is cool with BOS and it's all good
[1:57:42] <supervyxen> BOS not worth saving
[1:57:44] <OwlLightningMage> Pat is being a coward about the DLCs
[1:57:44] <+Maids4lyfe> the only thing the BoS is good for is stealing their power armor
[1:57:55] <%madhattergay> fuck BOS, fuck the Legion, and FUCK MR HOUSE
[1:57:56] <%valachi> Yeah you got a problem with murdering a bunch of douchebags?
[1:58:02] <%cappyd33> beat him to death pat

[1:58:16] <Estuko> @ElenaManetta I just keep all my clothes and towels in the bathroom so I can dry then change without letting the heat out
[1:58:17] <dekkitout> I love a good old fashioned Fascist power play
[1:58:17] <NumbusPlays> *crack* siiiiiiip
[1:58:17] <+biodomewithpaulyshor> *SIIIIIIIIIP* AHHHHH, New Vegas. Now THAT was a good game

[1:58:22] <%bread_assassin> Damn Boomers.
[1:58:25] <+SLVRBAKSLPZ> I've been to Nellis. not a bad base
[1:58:28] <Rincewind1998> @Smaenus that was a splinter group that decided to not be dicks
[1:58:33] <Estuko> @cureneckbeard -drags icon to trash bin-
[1:58:33] <joylent_blue> Smaenus yeah but thats a different branch of the brotherhood, diffrent leaders
[1:58:40] <callsigneagle01> @SLVRBAKSLPZ Nellis is pretty neat
[1:58:41] <StromkoPenguin> They were basically Lawful Good Paladin in FO3 so a lot of people don't like that BoS either
[1:58:42] <DSD24> Level up!
[1:58:43] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @Smaenus they were more noble in FO3, but it was also out of character for them, because they're usually isolationist technophiliacs
[1:58:47] <callsigneagle01> I'd like to see Red Flag
[1:58:49] <reinbachthe3rd> Time to murk Mr. House.
[1:58:54] <omen_setter> I like how he says boomer
[1:59:02] <Coystick> muh bull muh bear
[1:59:03] <FracturedImage> Mr House has a great VA
[1:59:05] <Smaenus> @Rincewind1998 @joylent_blue @ThatGuyfromMars Ah yeah true fair enough, it's been a while
[1:59:06] <%lewdskeletor13> I can’t stand this smarmy prick
[1:59:06] <DSD24> The Omertas are bunch of scumbags
[1:59:07] <%ElenaManetta> My favorite thing in these types of games is I NEED YOU TO GO DO THIS QU-- OH YOU ALREADY DID IT?
[1:59:07] <%TheNewJapanGuy> The Bull and The Bear....
[1:59:08] <zebexter> time to install Windows 10 to Mr House
[1:59:12] <linklol321> He turns on house because he asks vou to kill the brotherhood
[1:59:16] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> So who takes over after Caesar dies? I have gotten that far yet
[1:59:17] <+Maids4lyfe> is there a New Vegas remaster for ps4 and xbone?
[1:59:18] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @FracturedImage HE HAS THE BEST VA
[1:59:19] <+SLVRBAKSLPZ> @callsigneagle01 I work on B-2s. been out there for TDY a few times.
[1:59:27] <dukenux> yep House is a paranoid bastard

[1:59:36] <Rincewind1998> Man, this quest goes to some dark places
[1:59:36] <lloyddboy> DEGENERATES
[1:59:37] <Estuko> remember in FO4 when the BOS invaded and demanded all technology from the city trying to control it.
[1:59:40] <HefestoForges> degenerate here
[1:59:40] <%Gray_skies1993> I do appreciate Mr. House for one thing, his knowledge/deductive reasoning is INSANELY high
[1:59:41] <SpicyCheeseNips> Everyone in Gomorrah is a degernate
[1:59:41] <%mayorrev> DEGENERATES
[1:59:42] <%CerberusDriver> who in chat is the Degenerate
[1:59:44] <callsigneagle01> @SLVRBAKSLPZ That's pretty fucken rad man.
[1:59:47] <+Maids4lyfe> @ThatGuyfromMars oh thank you
[1:59:50] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 2 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 8oz (240mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[1:59:50] <%ElenaManetta> wowee look at all those maxed out STATS
[1:59:51] <Conky89> Ah so you got a little mole in that casino House?
[1:59:51] <joylent_blue> Mr Houses voice gives me the vapors
[1:59:52] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Degenerates like that belongs on a cross
[1:59:53] <%lewdskeletor13> @sphincter_spelunker Lanius does but it’s implied that the legion falls apart under his leadership
[1:59:53] <+dawsfloss> is that elmo or a pillow?
[1:59:54] <callsigneagle01> You work in Missouri?
[1:59:55] <bigstupidjellyfish1337> Degenerates are good tho
[1:59:55] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @Maids4lyfe <3
[1:59:55] <Estuko> @CerberusDriver if I raise my hand will I be in trouble
[1:59:57] <%MagickBurritoh> Kenshiro time
[1:59:58] <Prism_Wing> @cerberusdriver me, prolly
[1:59:58] <%0dokuro> big punches
[1:59:59] <%CerberusDriver> that question about dantes dick revealed some degenerates
[1:59:59] <Fujiwara_92> all cool for now
[2:00:00] <evbites> patis basically god
[2:00:02] <%DK_Rance> i love being a degenerate
[2:00:04] <%violetheart> House isn't a nice guy but he's extremely smart, and genuinely cares about the strip.
[2:00:07] <%laserbeaming> Do you happen to have a golf club for Mr House?
[2:00:08] <%Romulus1213> YEAH go punch stuff pat!
[2:00:10] <%rdark_ksu> white glove
[2:00:11] <%Das_Bass> the DLC?
[2:00:12] <DSD24> @Estuko Remember when the BOS blew up an entire technology rich location for the purpose of stopping synths?
[2:00:13] <+temporal_zenith> @dukenux All things considered that is a natural mindset to have in a post-apoc world
[2:00:14] <NumbusPlays> the DLC
[2:00:15] <TikanZK> all of the DLC :^)
[2:00:15] <joylent_blue> CerberusDriver if loving Dante's dick makes me a degenerate then SO BE IT

[2:00:19] <balquisa> BOS is the next best option since Enclave isn't joinable
[2:00:19] <%TheSpiritof2277> OWB baby

[2:00:20] <Tucker0603> @angriestpat DLC

[2:00:28] <RetributionP> DLC DB<
[2:00:29] <KeystoneA1> All 3 DLCs fuccboi
[2:00:30] <Darren716> They go before the ending
[2:00:30] <%laserbeaming> LONESOME ROAD
[2:00:30] <%lewdskeletor13> @violetheart he cares about CONTROLLING the strip
[2:00:31] <%Taisuru> DLCs
[2:00:31] <Estuko> @DSD24 fuck I totally forgot
[2:00:32] <krewl123> CLD
[2:00:33] <+xxviios> He cares about his base of power you mean
[2:00:33] <%kiiiirsten> Downloadable Content
[2:00:33] <Dio_TR> is it just me or does everyone kill House after doing the majority of his quests?
[2:00:35] <WorstCompany> Dead Money hype?
[2:00:38] <Darren716> DONT
[2:00:39] <evbites> you can do that
[2:00:39] <+SLVRBAKSLPZ> @callsigneagle01 Yup Whiteman. Smack dab middle America
[2:00:42] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Oh ok
[2:00:43] <FracturedImage> vault 19?
[2:00:43] <reinbachthe3rd> God, Dead Money was a pain in the dick.
[2:00:44] <RetributionP> FUCKING BOO
[2:00:45] <OwlLightningMage> Why would you do it like that LUL
[2:00:47] <lizard0tm> Boo!
[2:00:48] <Darren716> But the DLC only makes sense before the ending
[2:00:48] <tacostarvedbeast> @AngriestPat no love for the wazzle wifle?
[2:00:48] <Coystick> Fake NV Fan Pat
[2:00:49] <+PenmanLupine> Vault 19?
[2:00:49] <%doc_ock_rokc> old worl blues
[2:00:50] <%CerberusDriver> boooo
[2:00:51] <OToole42> boo
[2:00:54] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @Dio_TR I don't. I stick with Mr. House until the end
[2:00:55] <Tucker0603> Dis...A...POINTED
[2:00:56] <%TheSpiritof2277> boo
[2:00:56] <Prism_Wing> You have a shelf? Lofty.
[2:00:57] <%NWR_James> beat the game you coward
[2:00:58] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Dead Money eats
[2:01:01] <Estuko> @DSD24 man I hated that, I did the synths side but they still made me out like I'm the bad guy asshole. tf
[2:01:06] <%homelesstwinky> 4got raul
[2:01:07] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@Dio_TR) (warning)
[2:01:08] <%laserbeaming> I like Dead Money
[2:01:12] <+Grayhammatter> disaPPOINTED
[2:01:13] <callsigneagle01> @SLVRBAKSLPZ That's pretty sweet, though I've heard the B-2 takes a lot of maintenance time
[2:01:13] <%Gray_skies1993> I need the DLC Pat! I need it in my VEINS @AngriestPat
[2:01:16] <%violetheart> @lewdskeletor13 Hence why I said he's not nice. The strip's his home and he wants to protect it either way, but whether your idea of "protecting" it is a good or bad thing is up for debate.
[2:01:18] <Coystick> Dead Money slaps
[2:01:19] <jabu__jabu> do the new California mod
[2:01:19] <redsynod> We gonna see his dick hose?
[2:01:19] <%CerberusDriver> i like Alive Cash
[2:01:21] <dukenux> U-
[2:01:21] <OwlLightningMage> The DLCs are meant to be played as you progress through the game. Its why they have recommended level LUL
[2:01:21] <%0dokuro> just blame shawn
[2:01:22] <Estuko> LUL
[2:01:23] <PSI_Guy95> I come with two deadly weapons!
[2:01:23] <%ThatGuyfromMars> I love Dead Money, that's my favorite of the DLC
[2:01:24] <%madhattergay> you going yesman @AngriestPat ?
[2:01:25] <FracturedImage> dont forget about the enclave
[2:01:26] <TikanZK> if you dont like dead money you're a dumb coward
[2:01:27] <Nyemmers> the first half of dead money are good, the later part fucking sucks
[2:01:29] <StromkoPenguin> I never minded Dead Money, I felt Lonesome Road was the weak one of the bunch.
[2:01:31] <bigstupidjellyfish1337> Pat if you put new Vegas on a shelf you won’t be able to reach it
[2:01:32] <natebud> EDE probably has that gun if you still have it
[2:01:33] <shameimarusen> DLC is godlike
[2:01:38] <evbites> fo4 is morally fucked
[2:01:38] <DSD24> @Estuko Yep why the synth group would blow up that area I have no idea
[2:01:43] <RetributionP> Everyone stop watching the stream to boycott not doing the dlc
[2:01:46] <+TastySammiches> I like the /idea/ of dead money but actually playing it is a nightmare
[2:01:49] <Brofarian> Upon repeated playthroughs Dead Money is actually one of the better DLCs. Also Honest Hearts is the worst, it's only appeal is Joshua Graham and you only interact with him in like two scenes.
[2:01:56] <+PenmanLupine> he's in Vault 21
[2:01:57] <%AncelDeLambert> y'know... the worst part about the casinos taking your weapons is that it clears your quick slots
[2:01:59] <inz0mbiac> Carlito Caribbean Cool
[2:02:01] <natebud> vault 21
[2:02:02] <OwlLightningMage> Honest Hearts is the worst one
[2:02:04] <alrobot2014> Bye Bye Love is easily the buggiest quest in the game
[2:02:04] <StromkoPenguin> The Institute's motives in FO4 make no sense as anything but mustache twirling villainy.
[2:02:09] <+SLVRBAKSLPZ> @callsigneagle01 Alot. Best Aircraft in the world. A mess to work on. they're just old now.
[2:02:10] <%Kreegmeyer> was that stripper in white face??
[2:02:10] <Dio_TR> Which is y'all favorite DLC mines Dead Money
[2:02:11] <WorstCompany> @anceldelambert god that’s so true
[2:02:12] <Estuko> @DSD24 I just figured they were the absolute best decision for perserving the future but nope, we're bad guy evil illuminati fuckers.
[2:02:12] <Conky89> The issue with Dead Money is that it just starts getting tiring at the end.
[2:02:15] <%0dokuro> Dead Money > Honest Hearts
[2:02:15] <DSD24> If you are good at Melee then Dead Money is fine
[2:02:15] <Rincewind1998> Dead Money has the best writing, and worst gameplay of the entirety of 3, NV, and 4
[2:02:17] <%CerberusDriver> honest hearts haters get sent to the pit
[2:02:19] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @Dio_TR Dead Money
[2:02:21] <%Das_Bass> Honest Hearts is great
[2:02:22] <joylent_blue> Dead Money is probs my favorite DLC
[2:02:26] <Nyemmers> honest heart felt empty. joshua was cool af tho
[2:02:27] <Coystick> Spider-Man?1
[2:02:28] <dekkitout> Yuri!
[2:02:29] <Estuko> @StromkoPenguin I hate it despite loving the science and advancement in tech they had, I dig that shit.
[2:02:29] <%TheSpiritof2277> @AncelDeLambert Yeah I truly hate that. There's no mod to fix it either which extra sucks..
[2:02:29] <+paladinstarbuster> @AngriestPat Are you ever going back to Dragon Quest? maybe when the ultimate version comes out. It has both music tracks.
[2:02:30] <giga_bit> ok thanks yuri
[2:02:31] <Tucker0603> isn't there 4 DLC's?
[2:02:31] <tacostarvedbeast> sure ok yosuke
[2:02:33] <OwlLightningMage> Dead Money is great.
[2:02:34] <jabu__jabu> @cerberusdriver moon2H
[2:02:35] <balquisa> Only reason I like Honest Hearts is because I've been to Zion Park irl an dthought it was cool seeing it in game
[2:02:38] <%rdark_ksu> adore honest hearts
[2:02:40] <starotter70> It's been too long without Yuri
[2:02:40] <%laserbeaming> Dead Money is great
[2:02:40] <reinbachthe3rd> Yeah, Honest Hearts was weak in retrospect. Joshua Graham made the DLC, but he appears so little.
[2:02:41] <zebexter> @cerberusdriver But Woolie is down there
[2:02:42] <evbites> also the minutemen are easily the best ending because it's just you
[2:02:42] <natebud> there's also the ugh michelangelo quest
[2:02:42] <%Gray_skies1993> Zion is great I think
[2:02:43] <callsigneagle01> @SLVRBAKSLPZ yeah but they do good work. I'm more partial to the Bone though tbh
[2:02:44] <%afronooch> i hated Big Mt
[2:02:45] <Kaitepaints> I’m about blow up too
[2:02:45] <Tucker0603> honest hearts is great
[2:02:46] <+TastySammiches> honest hearts is cool but feels unfinished
[2:02:46] <+Bouerd> It's so short though
[2:02:48] <Brofarian> Dead Money was initially my least favorite, but it became my favorite because the characters and writing is the best
[2:02:52] <KeystoneA1> You can fuck Sarah
[2:02:52] <%snow_bush> Better than Dead Money
[2:02:52] <C_S_N_G> I the story of the old man in the cave
[2:02:54] <supervyxen> HH is great OWB is bad
[2:02:54] <KeystoneA1> That's about it
[2:02:54] <%doc_ock_rokc> Old World Blues Is the best though
[2:02:54] <OwlLightningMage> Honest Hearts is good but too short
[2:02:54] <+JollyHeracross> joshua. fucking. graham.
[2:02:55] <Ser_Randal> small brain
[2:02:57] <%nofestu2> Joshua Graham is so cool
[2:02:57] <SuperFightinRobot> Wait shit did I miss lonesome road?
[2:02:57] <InugamiTheHound> i love honest hearts. Its the only DLC I've played.
[2:02:57] <%crimsonharvest> I hate Honest Hearts because I was raised Mormon and i want to puke when i go to HH
[2:02:59] <%CerberusDriver> @zebexter BACK TO THE PIT.
[2:02:59] <person181> yoske?
[2:03:00] <joylent_blue> people always praise OWB, but the enemies in it are annoying as FUCK
[2:03:03] <%TheSpiritof2277> Honest Hearts has a lot of good side-content, don't know why it gets so much flack. it's just not AS good as Dead Money, or certainly not OWB's writing
[2:03:03] <Coystick> Ah the hustle and bustle of the strip
[2:03:03] <WorstCompany> @angriestpat but you hate Dead Money?
[2:03:03] <%PlainSimpleTailor> You can get penis wet
[2:03:04] <%BonewheelVanguard> can we all agree that Old World Blues is the best
[2:03:06] <natebud> The lady there wants you to find her vault suits, but that's it
[2:03:07] <shameimarusen> Best part of honest hearts was the story of that dude that lived in the caves
[2:03:09] <dekkitout> Yuri Everywhere System is gaining steam
[2:03:09] <redsynod> yosuke
[2:03:10] <+chernobyl_hobo> What about the guy who's girlfriend is at Gamorra.
[2:03:10] <zebexter> @cerberusdriver awe ok
[2:03:12] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @joylent_blue it's fiiiiiiine
[2:03:12] <Estuko> EY, who talking about Joshua fucking GRAHAM
[2:03:12] <DSD24> The worst part is that the institute never gave a reason as to why they are abducting people and replacing them
[2:03:13] <%rdark_ksu> the vault 21 lady sends you on a souviner quest i think
[2:03:15] <%Graywolf_the_45th> I think the only quest for vault 22 is getting the front desk lady vault suits
[2:03:18] <evbites> true but brains in jars
[2:03:19] <Dio_TR> Old World Blues is cool for like a second but the setting is just boring.
[2:03:20] <%cappyd33> we can't let god do all the work.
[2:03:21] <OwlLightningMage> OWB is the best one Honest Hearts is the weakest one but still fine
[2:03:26] <Coystick> The Singed Dude
[2:03:26] <KeystoneA1> Randall Clark best unseen character ever
[2:03:27] <ochmock> WHAT UP PAT!!!!!!!
[2:03:28] <Brofarian> Honest Hearts is the worst, borning environment, basically all the enemies are redressed raiders or bigger animals. And there are like two cool pieces of loot.
[2:03:28] <WorstCompany> @bonewheelvanguard but my Dead Money tho
[2:03:29] <TikanZK> get gud pat
[2:03:30] <%Gatzarlok> @AngriestPat There's an unmarked quest to bring the main lady jumpsuits for sex in 21.
[2:03:31] <giga_bit> We can't expected go to do all the work.
[2:03:31] <%Das_Bass> The survivalist is amazing
[2:03:32] <+TastySammiches> dead money just has so much BULLSHIT
[2:03:42] <joylent_blue> OWB's writing is charming for a bit, but its kinda one note-y after a while
[2:03:43] <%ThatGuyfromMars> dead money is just so good
[2:03:48] <dekkitout> Josh Graham might as well also carry a chain made of hellfire
[2:03:49] <WorstCompany> Although I really wish the collars had a different penalty somehow...
[2:03:50] <evbites> also evil toaster and talking to yourself
[2:03:50] <Coystick> Dead Money has best characters and atmo ya'll crazy
[2:03:50] <Smaenus> @DSD24 Yeah that really stood out for me, always seemed like an artificial way to make them "Evil" when in reality they are actually the best hope for restoring the world
[2:03:54] <Brofarian> Dead Money I applaud for actually changing the gameplay and legitimately giving it a different feel and atmosphere because of it.
[2:03:54] <+chaumiester> you collect Vault Suits, then you bang the lady in Vault 21 Hotel
[2:03:58] <+emperri> eatin pizzas dude
[2:04:00] <OwlLightningMage> Lonesome Road has the best character in the franchise which helps it a lot. The whole of it is fine
[2:04:00] <%Gray_skies1993> I like Dead Money's writing, but the gameplay with the bombs always annoyed me
[2:04:01] <%CerberusDriver> Michael Angelo sounds super familiar.... HMMM
[2:04:02] <%Das_Bass> The survivalist made me love Honest Hearts
[2:04:04] <Estuko> @DSD24 it was built up to be total evil science group till you actually meet them then it's just evil for evil sake
[2:04:07] <%0dokuro> They did but it was fucked up why, it was so they could smoothly operate while knowing whats happening above ground.
[2:04:07] <%laserbeaming> I like Dead Money because I really like the companions there
[2:04:09] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @joylent_blue someone didn't like the toaster that wants to take over the world
[2:04:13] <+biodomewithpaulyshor> Gameplay: OWB > Honest Hearts > Lonesome Road > Dead Money Lore: Dead Money > Old World Blues > Honest Hearts > Lonesome Road
[2:04:18] <BaronVonDickButt> Why does it need to take 2-3 hours to talk to the scientists in Old World Blues? like holy shit thats the most exhausting dialog EVER!
[2:04:19] <%mayorrev> TUBULAR
[2:04:19] <%ozzyzak> yeah dead money gameplay wise didnt do it for me
[2:04:19] <kingra> This mod makes him look so generic
[2:04:20] <%BonewheelVanguard> @WorstCompany Mobius is a better Elijah than Elijah
[2:04:21] <helpmeimafruit> worst turtle
[2:04:21] <+SLVRBAKSLPZ> @callsigneagle01 Never worked on one. only have seen them at airshows. Also, a work of art.
[2:04:22] <Kaitepaints> Did y’all hear about riot trying to work on their office culture? Hopefully they chip away at the LoL community too
[2:04:28] <+dawsfloss> what a wacky guy
[2:04:29] <%mayorrev> @helpmeimafruit how dare you
[2:04:31] <evbites> damn it vergil stop fucking
[2:04:33] <godzookylives> If he doesn't say "COWABUNGA" I will be very disappointed
[2:04:33] <%Das_Bass> bazinga
[2:04:34] <reinbachthe3rd> My "autistic" name.
[2:04:35] <dukenux> Bazinger
[2:04:36] <%TheSpiritof2277> Zimbabwe
[2:04:41] <callsigneagle01> @SLVRBAKSLPZ Yeah, they're all wonderful planes
[2:04:42] <Conky89> I do enjoy the challenge of Dead Money, but Old World Blues has some of the funniest writing and was quite memorable.
[2:04:43] <%0dokuro> da warmth
[2:04:43] <starotter70> oh no
[2:04:46] <Nyemmers> the atmosphere on dead money are goddamn immersive. shame about the gameplay part
[2:04:46] <%manwithboxonhead> I’m a messenger from ***.
[2:04:47] <zebexter> @cerberusdriver Sounds like a cuck
[2:04:47] <st_jimmy456> damn dude
[2:04:51] <joylent_blue> ThatGuyfromMars i like the individual ideas, but when EVERY appliance has a similar quirk they all kinda run together i guess? eh
[2:04:53] <%Wrashis> ghosts
[2:04:57] <%Ion_LaserX> Michael Angelo? Was Dona Tello taken?
[2:04:57] <stiffybiro> bonjingo
[2:05:05] <%CerberusDriver> Cowa Bunga
[2:05:10] <dekkitout> Yeah-
[2:05:11] <Brofarian> Honestly I think the bomb stuff and ghost people really work for the survival horror vibe they're going for in Dead Money.
[2:05:12] <Smaenus> I am Leon Ardo
[2:05:12] <Estuko> fear of the outside world? LUL tell me about it
[2:05:12] <%AncelDeLambert> he AND his sister have it
[2:05:16] <DSD24> @Smaenus Especially the "we need to stop the Commonwealth from having a Government" even though that would never pose a threat to the Institute
[2:05:16] <%Gray_skies1993> apatBig AGORAPHOBIA
[2:05:17] <kingra> Yeah :(
[2:05:17] <%DK_Rance> what is that?
[2:05:17] <%Ciphris> i have agoraphobia
[2:05:21] <%Das_Bass> can you blame him
[2:05:22] <JanusII> I have agoraphobia and I agree.
[2:05:23] <+linSP> i dont like a gore either
[2:05:23] <%ozzyzak> i wonder how common it is, because I can't oimagine
[2:05:26] <%manwithboxonhead> Fear of open space.
[2:05:26] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @joylent_blue I dunno, I tried to get with one of the light switches and she kept blowing me out, what a turn off
[2:05:26] <WorstCompany> @bonewheelvanguard on one hand, it IS Cam Clarke doing Mobius, on the other, locking Elijah in the vault’s so good. It’s a giant “you didn’t win” move on him.
[2:05:27] <+xxviios> It Fjcked mine up!
[2:05:28] <%0dokuro> first option
[2:05:31] <%TheSpiritof2277> 2nd LUL
[2:05:32] <Dio_TR> didn't notice until now that THE BABY Was sleeping
[2:05:33] <+Galactor123> Hah. I like the trepanation option.
[2:05:36] <kingra> Agoraphobia is fucking awful
[2:05:36] <%afronooch> al gore aint that scary tho
[2:05:39] <natebud> let's sing the Indoors song
[2:05:40] <%doc_ock_rokc> Al gore wasn't someone I liked ether
[2:05:40] <%AncelDeLambert> trepanation, lol

[2:05:47] <Brofarian> The pure honesty
[2:05:47] <%crimsonharvest> If you cant be cured the best thing is to get the inspiration elsewhere?
[2:05:48] <%0dokuro> XD
[2:05:50] <+dawsfloss> what is the fear of omlettes?
[2:05:51] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@AncelDeLambert) (warning)
[2:05:52] <godzookylives> scoop out his brain
[2:05:55] <zebexter> bruh we all need therapy
[2:05:57] <%doc_ock_rokc> @afronooch he is when he breaks out the slideshows
[2:05:59] <Kaitepaints> I had agoraphobia and it took a long time to stop giving a fuck
[2:06:00] <omen_setter> get Freud on his ass
[2:06:04] <Brofarian> The Shalia method of psychiatry
[2:06:07] <Estuko> suck his dick
[2:06:08] <%AncelDeLambert> fuck off, moobot, that was the first time I capped all night
[2:06:08] <waifoong98> @dawsfloss chrisphobia? Kappa
[2:06:13] <Smaenus> @DSD24 Yeah the story really bothered me with some stuff, the more you think about it the more inconsistencies there are
[2:06:18] <natebud> the follower armed only with a camera
[2:06:20] <%snow_bush> GO NEET
[2:06:23] <chestnuts42> When are you going to play kingdom come deliverance
[2:06:26] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Cameraaa
[2:06:27] <+sirrice77> i finished the game and never knew about this guy till another playthrough
[2:06:27] <%NWR_James> His name upsets me greatly
[2:06:29] <ScreamingMeat> a CAMra
[2:06:29] <joylent_blue> ThatGuyfromMars ..... PunOko pvpSlay
[2:06:33] <%kewlmyc> Do the violence!
[2:06:34] <Kaitepaints> How?!

[2:06:35] <dukenux> Bring me picture of Spider-man!
[2:06:36] <+ilasper1> just rob him
[2:06:38] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @joylent_blue <3
[2:06:38] <ScreamingMeat> No...
[2:06:43] <%AncelDeLambert> it PAYS
[2:06:44] <%ElenaManetta> I feel like, you could've only had agoraphobia for a very short amount of time in this world. Because... How did you GET here.
[2:06:45] <waifoong98> kill him LUL
[2:06:46] <%BonewheelVanguard> @WorstCompany That moment is great but I think finding out Mobius is just pretending to be a carton villain is just the best
[2:06:48] <OwlLightningMage> I don't like this quest
[2:06:49] <Dio_TR> Can you blame him Shreks are all over the place
[2:06:51] <Boxbunnytheliar> if you have all the fast travel locations it's honestly pretty quick
[2:06:51] <Estuko> I always wanted a REAL camera to work, like Metal Gear Peacewalker style FeelsBadMan
[2:06:54] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Fuck this
[2:06:54] <Tucker0603> Punch him, punch him now
[2:06:54] <Conky89> The third option just makes you go from 0% to 1000%
[2:06:54] <natebud> Like he needs money
[2:06:55] <evbites> easy peasy
[2:06:56] <Desertfishing> STEEEVE
[2:06:56] <%Ion_LaserX> @ElenaManetta Exactly!
[2:06:57] <therinfal> its a really cute quest to do throughout the game but not towards endgame
[2:06:57] <%Gray_skies1993> @ElenaManetta he lived in a Vault
[2:06:59] <dukenux> i think its fine, you just need to take it while you havent discovered everything yet
[2:07:06] <%0dokuro> all the pictures
[2:07:08] <%Wukku> He looks like ventriloquist dummy
[2:07:08] <%TheSpiritof2277> it pays a little? but you have like 97,000 caps already
[2:07:10] <reinbachthe3rd> Making those fat stacks.
[2:07:14] <KNEEGOOSE> Go take a picture of the war memorial
[2:07:17] <DSD24> @Smaenus I remember as soon as I got the ending after that 3 minute ending reel I jumped off that tower and died because everyone was being dumb
[2:07:17] <natebud> What if he asked for all these pictures of sings and one picture of easy pete?
[2:07:18] <zebexter> time to get those nudes
[2:07:18] <%ElenaManetta> Fuck artists
[2:07:19] <%madhattergay> lol codac
[2:07:22] <+TONYOO101> @ElenaManetta he's from the vault under new vegas, so he technically didnt have to go somewhere, he was always there
[2:07:26] <Brofarian> you're basically half spider-man now
[2:07:30] <Estuko> Get pictures of brock lesner's asshole
[2:07:33] <blakeway> go get nudes of easy pete
[2:07:33] <Kaitepaints> Watch, he’s going to sell your photos behind your back
[2:07:35] <Smaenus> @DSD24 LUL

[2:07:52] <godzookylives> Bring me pictures of Man-Spider!
[2:07:54] <natebud> I need nudes of Caesar
[2:08:01] <OwlLightningMage> Elmo is napping in rage o his loss hair
[2:08:02] <DSD24> @Smaenus "I know you just blew up the Institute with all that technology but we have MORE missions for you!"
[2:08:02] <reinbachthe3rd> Nudes of Easy Pete. I guess that's why they call him "Easy..."
[2:08:03] <zebexter> @thatguyfrommars through a chain link fence
[2:08:04] <+dawsfloss> Pat should try and play Oblivion at some point
[2:08:06] <Conky89> Rude
[2:08:07] <JanusII> Wow robophobic.
[2:08:09] <starotter70> sipsipElmo

[2:08:13] <%madhattergay> bring me pictures of spiders-man
[2:08:14] <%ThatGuyfromMars> ave true to kaiser

[2:08:19] <+Grayhammatter> yep, gotta be in the wall
[2:08:24] <stiffybiro> not very nice, patrick
[2:08:25] <%0dokuro> Pat playing oblivion would be great
[2:08:26] <WorstCompany> @bonewheelvanguard Oh don’t get me wrong, I really like that too and I love OWB as a whole, it’s just the atmosphere the Sierra Madre’s got going on makes me prefer DM a bit more.
[2:08:38] <%CerberusDriver> play Oblivion sometime, yes indeed
[2:08:46] <%CerberusDriver> i love Oblivions side quests
[2:08:47] <natebud> At least you can navigate this vault
[2:08:52] <DSD24> Oblivion has the best Guild Questlines
[2:08:53] <evbites> yeah shaun was bad son
[2:08:54] <stiffybiro> please apologise to the robotic being
[2:08:55] <%doc_ock_rokc> it makes sense
[2:08:57] <moreknigth> does pat have the cyber implant ?
[2:09:01] <evbites> yup
[2:09:02] <%Gray_skies1993> it makes perfect sense actually
[2:09:04] <+xxviios> Vault 21 is in the Strip
[2:09:04] <%ThatGuyfromMars> it's weird how people are laughing and clapping BUT THERE'S NOBODY IN THE VAULT
[2:09:05] <zebexter> @cerberusdriver Stop, you violated the law
[2:09:07] <Estuko> @CerberusDriver those were mind blowing to a young me, I loved them.

[2:09:14] <%rdark_ksu> @AngriestPat Imagine seeing the sky for the first time
[2:09:14] <Brofarian> I was disappointed in OWB because I never got my cool ceramic katana that DM promised me. Also they never did anything cool with those weird crystals.
[2:09:15] <%TheSpiritof2277> Hey Liam
[2:09:16] <lizard0tm> Sound of laughter and talking in a completely empty place
[2:09:16] <%lewdskeletor13> Carlitos is a cool name

[2:10:04] <%laserbeaming> Have you heard of the high elves?
[2:10:04] <Estuko> @DSD24 FeelsBadMan my fan ran away during a fight and I found his body in a river later
[2:10:05] <reinbachthe3rd> The name Carlitos always reminds me of Dead Rising.
[2:10:06] <Kaitepaints> love his voice
[2:10:07] <joylent_blue> Liam and Yuri make up at least 3/4ths of the characters
[2:10:11] <%Gray_skies1993> @lewdskeletor13 basically him and Yuri
[2:10:13] <zebexter> Tunnel snakes rule! shit wrong fallout
[2:10:14] <DSD24> @zeroraider Don't take too much or you will die
[2:10:18] <+linSP> ligma?
[2:10:18] <%TheSpiritof2277> The holy trinity
[2:10:19] <+dawsfloss> BUT then again Pat once said he didnt find the elder scrolld world very interesting
[2:10:19] <%laserbeaming> I saw a mudcrab the other day. Disgusting creatures
[2:10:20] <%snow_bush> EVERYTHING
[2:10:22] <%mastertwin2> This game's voices are literally one third Yuri, one third Liam, and one third Laura
[2:10:23] <+pardonedprophet> I lived my whole life in a valley, then I moved a to a flatland and it freaked me out not having mountains to border the horizon.
[2:10:24] <$SGrim> 85% of the voices rooKb
[2:10:28] <%ElenaManetta> Phil Lamarr?
[2:10:30] <+psycosis> Not gonna lie,I can't stand Laura Bailey
[2:10:30] <Brofarian> Voice acting...voice acting never changes...
[2:10:32] <starotter70> Like everything
[2:10:34] <InugamiTheHound> phil LaMarr?
[2:10:34] <dekkitout> Kerri Peyton?
[2:10:34] <%BonewheelVanguard> @WorstCompany I feel that, but Wild Wasteland just put gave me that little push into likening the weird ass atmosphere more than the survival horror esc Sierra Madre.
[2:10:34] <%Dr00_PhD> kevin michael richardson?
[2:10:35] <%CerberusDriver> skooma den
[2:10:35] <tacostarvedbeast> i need a mod that puts head phones on every character voiced by yuri
[2:10:35] <%mayorrev> Darpa Chief?
[2:10:37] <WorstCompany> @reinbachthe3rd same
[2:10:38] <%lewdskeletor13> The Patron Saints of Voice Acting
[2:10:39] <T_Sasquatch> but WHY ?
[2:10:40] <DothMyNugsBequeathMe> i would say 90% Kappa
[2:10:40] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Black_Voice.wav
[2:10:41] <%VanaSkiller> yea everything LUL
[2:10:44] <waifoong98> so this game is the CLONE WARS? Kappa
[2:10:44] <%ThatGuyfromMars> and they got haku from spirited away too
[2:10:46] <%Rafferty3231> Keith David?
[2:10:46] <%ooblagis> At least they're good voices
[2:10:49] <PaPaSeppuku> big nut fuck
[2:10:50] <joylent_blue> its nuts, but its also really endearing in a weird way
[2:10:51] <%doc_ock_rokc> nucking futs
[2:10:52] <%Das_Bass> 18 months to make a game
[2:10:53] <balquisa> Shoutout to Wes Johnson
[2:10:53] <T_Sasquatch> i dont understand why they use the same voice actors
[2:10:54] <%homelesstwinky> might be
[2:10:57] <%mayorrev> Don't forget Danny Trejo
[2:10:58] <OwlLightningMage> All of the Brotherhood being Yuri is hilarious LUL
[2:10:58] <Conky89> Hey, a person has to eat and pay bills afterall
[2:10:58] <+Badgerconda_> Yeah, but unlike, say, Oblivion, you can't really tell they're the same people because they're not just doing the same voices....
[2:11:00] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Sammy Davis Jr?
[2:11:01] <nelsonq415> is he famous?
[2:11:02] <InugamiTheHound> Phil Lamarr is also the voice of Vamp
[2:11:03] <%Superstarsage> Money+Time=Cut Corners
[2:11:04] <%lewdskeletor13> Phil Lamar played Static Shock
[2:11:06] <%Plague_Nurse> Bethesda does that for all their games
[2:11:09] <DSD24> @Smaenus Don't forget Shaun giving you a Synth kid for no reason other that what I would assume to be guilt tripping
[2:11:09] <dukenux> i think Keith David is in this, but he does handful of voice
[2:11:11] <stiffybiro> better woolie
[2:11:12] <helpmeimafruit> lets get patrick stewart for 3 lines
[2:11:15] <tacostarvedbeast> Stop Criminal Scum!

[2:11:24] <%CerberusDriver> THANK YE KIND SIR
[2:11:24] <%Gray_skies1993> to be fair, they also had MASSIVE celebrity presence in this game.
[2:11:24] <Smaenus> @DSD24 Yo what the fuck was up with that, I forgot about that shit
[2:11:25] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @Estuko YES
[2:11:26] <%0dokuro> what about those voice lines not cut out lol
[2:11:30] <+KanjiTatsumi> Did you hear about how lines in Oblivion were recorded alphabetically?
[2:11:30] <%Ion_LaserX> @Estuko Yes LUL
[2:11:30] <Dio_TR> Man, you could make some really funny SFM animations with how Pat has conversations with the NPC's kinda like Freeman's Mind
[2:11:31] <%Wrashis> stop right there criminal scum
[2:11:31] <Tucker0603> STOP CRIMINAL SCUM
[2:11:33] <zebexter> I want Keith David to read to me

[2:12:22] <%Gray_skies1993> @Estuko oh god I was just talking about that quest with friends the other day
[2:12:22] <stiffybiro> u violate law hehe uwu =^.^=
[2:12:23] <DSD24> Remember the Criminal Scum song on youtube?
[2:12:24] <dukenux> But i NEED those potions. Im going into battle!
[2:12:25] <%rdark_ksu> my potions are to strong for a mere mortal such as you
[2:12:25] <%MisterTylerrr> That video kills me to this day
[2:12:27] <Lord_of_all_Edges> that lady is stripping to an empty room
[2:12:28] <+Badgerconda_> The issue is that in oblivion they had the same voice actors do the -same voices- for multiple characters. In New Vegas they've got talented voice actors doing variations on their voices for different characters so it's not nearly as noticable or grating.
[2:12:29] <%0dokuro> ITS THE GRAND CHAMPION
[2:12:29] <tacostarvedbeast> man i miss manslayer vids, he still making stuff?
[2:12:32] <Lord_of_all_Edges> that is depressing
[2:12:35] <Smaenus> How is that video like 10 minutes long tho
[2:12:38] <Estuko> @Gray_skies1993 that fucked me up and I rushed it because I didn't want my mom to see lmfao

[2:18:29] <%MaiHusbando9S> 3 minutes pat

[2:18:39] <%TheSpiritof2277> apatWrong
[2:18:39] <%Superstarsage> pat rewatched it a bunch
[2:18:40] <waifoong98> stop ruining the video Pat Kappa
[2:18:41] <%Das_Bass> I just watched it pat
[2:18:42] <$SGrim> Pat would think 3 minutes is a long time rooKek
[2:18:42] <supervyxen> pat it's THREE MINUTES
[2:18:44] <%0dokuro> he's so over the top its great
[2:18:44] <%goose_attack_almanac> 3 but feels longer
[2:18:45] <+profanityincluded> his channel is full of videos like it
[2:18:48] <+conradical> it's basically an hour
[2:18:49] <%SmoochSpider> @AngriestPat when you do the potion seller voice, you sound like James from Pokemon
[2:18:49] <DrMoose7> it's great
[2:18:49] <dekkitout> The flow of time is convoluted under the effects of [Crazy Talk]
[2:18:50] <%CerberusDriver> ????
[2:18:51] <DonatelloJose> It gets better and better
[2:18:55] <OwlLightningMage> It was super long and Pat used Crazy Talk to ruin it LUL
[2:18:55] <%king_wragles> You're right Pat, it does get super old. Like almost immediately
[2:18:56] <%ThePuddingDead> so long
[2:18:56] <joylent_blue> LUL
[2:18:57] <%Tracazoid> 3 minutes of a man trying to buy some potions is like an hour real time.
[2:18:57] <+arancet> thats real long for whats basically a one joke bit
[2:18:58] <zebexter> guys I think it's e minutes
[2:18:58] <%BonewheelVanguard> @WorstCompany Dude, he is the coolest NPC in the game, but all the "strength" stuff is dumb
[2:18:58] <lizard0tm> It's like 3 mins
[2:18:59] <PSI_Guy95> 3 minutes is 10 minutes in internet time but a non-stop stream is only ever 5 minutes longer in internet time
[2:19:00] <%ReallyRedRum> My potions would kill a dragon, let alone a man
[2:19:00] <natebud> How old are you in internet years pat?
[2:19:01] <%Das_Bass> apatWrong apatWrong apatWrong apatWrong
[2:19:01] <%ThatGuyfromMars> man mans1ayer used to do the fucking funniest oblivion videos
[2:19:02] <zebexter> 3
[2:19:03] <%madhattergay> apatCrazyhand apatCrazyhead apatCrazy
[2:19:03] <a_mad_dragon> three minutes? that's like twenty minutes!
[2:19:04] <+Grayhammatter> it's 3 minutes pat LUL
[2:19:05] <Fujiwara_92> what's the name of the video
[2:19:05] <DracaenaLeaf> I agree with Pat
[2:19:10] <+emperri> says man who made let's plays for years
[2:19:11] <Conky89> Time is money, and when you are wasting time, then you are wasting money
[2:19:16] <%Wrashis> it does feel much longer than it is
[2:19:17] <C_S_N_G> Internet time is like anime time
[2:19:17] <+emperri> and continues to make 3 hour podcasts
[2:19:18] <PSI_Guy95> We need to get that pikaDICK
[2:19:18] <nelsonq415> I'll go elsewhere for my potions and I'll never come back! lol
[2:19:20] <%Das_Bass> you made 30 min LP
[2:19:21] <%Superstarsage> Ronnn staph it
[2:19:21] <joylent_blue> Tim Curry?
[2:19:22] <%rumtumtugnutz> literally the same voice
[2:19:23] <%kewlmyc> LUL
[2:19:23] <%Svanyr> Yeah James is full Pegasus/ foppy
[2:19:26] <+psycosis> @natebud Pats dead in Internet years
[2:19:27] <%afronooch> @natebud fuckin primoridial
[2:19:27] <alwayspronking> Its like he's really here
[2:19:27] <%doc_ock_rokc> Crazy Talk eradicated the time of the 10 minutes
[2:19:28] <%snow_bush> That is true, Jame's is more flamboiant
[2:19:29] <zeroraider> 3 minute videos took 3 hours to download back then
[2:19:30] <+Grayhammatter> that sounds like jesse went fucking kermit the frog
[2:19:31] <+Lillowh> I mean james was a Rich Kid
[2:19:31] <%Das_Bass> so is that a year
[2:19:32] <%doc_ock_rokc> Don't ask it just works
[2:19:33] <%ReallyRedRum> That sounds like Jerry Seinfeld
[2:19:34] <alcors_wisdom> ah that was actually pretty good
[2:19:36] <%Real_Todd_Howard> never ever complain about the 3 hour podcasts
[2:19:36] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Were Jesse and James schtupping
[2:19:38] <%weissguard> Jame's voice seems to have eased off of that accent in recent years.
[2:19:44] <%0dokuro> shhhhhhh
[2:19:45] <%korth367> is that crazy talks other ability?
[2:19:45] <+miguelrod777> you wouldnt download a pikachu
[2:19:45] <starotter70> LUL
[2:19:46] <DSD24> James is the best
[2:19:47] <%MelBrooksKA> Oops, all voices
[2:19:48] <%Ion_LaserX> LUL
[2:19:48] <zebexter> James got vored a lot
[2:19:49] <%0dokuro> we don't talk about that
[2:19:51] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[2:19:52] <HefestoForges> LUL
[2:19:54] <%Gray_skies1993> Pat doing James voice gives me life
[2:19:54] <%Typhaeon> I'd pay to hear the dub of that
[2:19:55] <%laserbeaming> LUL
[2:19:55] <+HostilePoundcakes> LUL
[2:19:58] <+ArcanumMBD> SEX BAD VIOLENCE OKAY
[2:19:59] <lizard0tm> James was pretty hot tho
[2:20:00] <%TheSpiritof2277> James biddies > Jessie
[2:20:02] <reinbachthe3rd> Hey, man - James had some serious fake titties in that banned episode.
[2:20:02] <ScreamingMeat> America HATES boobs!
[2:20:03] <%goose_attack_almanac> James is the best Pokemon trainer, he doesn't even need to battle wild pokemon to catch them
[2:20:04] <DonatelloJose> That episode is the tits
[2:20:05] <%mayorrev> @weissguard really? that sucks :[
[2:20:06] <%yeknomlive> james crossdressed a lot
[2:20:07] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> I never freaked my shit
[2:20:07] <%ThatGuyfromMars> The americans weren't ready for a man with big tibbies
[2:20:08] <%madhattergay> james has the biggest tiddys
[2:20:09] <angelmorphic> @AngriestPat whens next resident woolie stream?
[2:20:11] <Desertfishing> men are better women Kappa
[2:20:11] <Wesciet> Hey
[2:20:12] <PSI_Guy95> ....why is he sleeping with his hat on
[2:20:12] <%Ion_LaserX> Us Americans: A man with titties? THE FUCK
[2:20:13] <+profanityincluded> Boobs Bad, Violence Good!
[2:20:17] <dukenux> Tibby seller i need your STRONGEST TIDDY
[2:20:17] <%afronooch> Tibbies go down GUNS GO UP
[2:20:20] <arcaderabbit48> @Typhaeon I think that episode did actually get dubbed. You should search around online
[2:20:21] <Conky89> They sure did fuck their shit. They made rice balls into donuts damnit!
[2:20:23] <%SmoochSpider> Didn't Ash's mom win the whole thing
[2:20:25] <CrypticMochi> That rocket guy with the gun was never seen again
[2:20:29] <zeroraider> That episode didn't have their CORE values
[2:20:32] <natebud> James' titties do not represent the core values of pokemon
[2:20:36] <DSD24> Team Rocket is weighing James down
[2:20:39] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Weird fact: You get to see Misty's breasts (kinda) on a Japanese card
[2:20:43] <%Typhaeon> Oh, neat.
[2:20:44] <+ArcanumMBD> You CANT HANDLE my strongest TIDDIES. They are only for the STRONG
[2:20:50] <ScreamingMeat> Meanwhile in the UK, Boobs good Violence Bad
[2:20:56] <Prism_Wing> @profanityincluded animal slave violence at that!
[2:20:56] <%madhattergay> like when pikachu killed all those kids
[2:21:02] <%CerberusDriver> just do this stream as James please
[2:21:02] <DSD24> Remember when James and Jessie got married in the Pokemon manga?
[2:21:04] <%0dokuro> cant show tiddies, but sending people's souls to the shadow realm is okay apatDab apatDab
[2:21:08] <person181> that was close
[2:21:09] <+Grayhammatter> it already went
[2:21:11] <redsynod> Wasn't that porygon?
[2:21:11] <$cureneckbeard> Looking forward to the Galor region with Team Brexit
[2:21:11] <+Badgerconda_> That sounds like a Pat plan, more than anything.
[2:21:12] <%ThePuddingDead> @AngriestPat Prepare for trouble! Make it Biddies!
[2:21:12] <%FriedMattato> When are we going to get that Team Rocket spin off?
[2:21:13] <PSI_Guy95> You need to do the Potion Knight voice but say James lines
[2:21:13] <joylent_blue> its going going gone
[2:21:15] <starotter70> @DSD24 what!?
[2:21:16] <Estuko> @natebud it awakened several thousand core values within people KAppa
[2:21:16] <Worldbrand> What about a parrot trying to be paige
[2:21:17] <PSI_Guy95> Trick yourself into doing it right
[2:21:19] <+Grayhammatter> it sounded like kermit to me
[2:21:21] <+profanityincluded> Wasnt it porygon that killed all those japanese children?
[2:21:22] <WorstCompany> @bonewheelvanguard I will always hold that his “War...War never changes....But men do, through the roads they walk” line is a better thing to end New Vegas as a whole than the main game’s.
[2:21:26] <zebexter> Jesse help, my Pokemon won't stop fucking with me
[2:21:27] <helpmeimafruit> My name is Nathan Fielder

[2:22:33] <krymzen5> it was very disappointing imo. also that scene is blinding
[2:22:34] <+KanjiTatsumi> That scene causes the bitrate to go to SHIT on Netflix
[2:22:35] <%Ion_LaserX> That part WAS NUTS
[2:22:35] <zeroraider> ASStigirl
[2:22:36] <%madhattergay> seizure room
[2:22:37] <zebexter> give me the sweet release of seizures
[2:22:37] <Prism_Wing> Epilepsy is pretty negative.
[2:22:39] <stiffybiro> waifu mum
[2:22:40] <Wesciet> Someone at Pixar has a child murder boner
[2:22:47] <tacostarvedbeast> since pat warned us about that movie i remembered to just look away during that part
[2:22:48] <%SaltyDongs> yeah I member
[2:22:48] <joylent_blue> Screen Slaver is a strong villain name tho
[2:22:48] <natebud> More people are killed by watching Incredibles 2 each year than by hippos
[2:22:49] <%MakotoPB> yep
[2:22:49] <+whackerica> yeah i cant believe a test audience didnt comment on that...
[2:22:51] <%0dokuro> same
[2:22:53] <%BonewheelVanguard> @WorstCompany All the Ed-E stuff was super good too. He had better character development than nearly every other companion.
[2:22:53] <helpmeimafruit> @AngriestPat Pixar is like Mr Glass from Unbreakable. They want the strong children to survive and become superheroes.
[2:22:54] <PSI_Guy95> Pixar wants to fuck some children up
[2:22:55] <%homelesstwinky> that got pretty wild
[2:22:55] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> it was kool
[2:22:56] <$rytyoung> Same
[2:22:58] <Press_X_ToJASON> built to kill children
[2:22:58] <+profanityincluded> Cull the weak, crush the industry, advance the gene.
[2:22:59] <Yeajow> Yeah I looked away like just in case
[2:22:59] <+dwindledwarf> i died watching it
[2:22:59] <%Shadowthedigger> Banned like that Porygon episode
[2:23:00] <supervyxen> "this is the part where i fuck the audience"
[2:23:04] <DothMyNugsBequeathMe> pat you baby
[2:23:05] <KangarooCyborg> well time to look this up
[2:23:05] <disister1201> yeah it was a bit much
[2:23:06] <%Gray_skies1993> yeah it was pretty insane actually
[2:23:07] <%madhattergay> i got motion sik
[2:23:08] <DracaenaLeaf> I couldn't remember how I felt
[2:23:09] <%Typhaeon> I could bear it but felt physical discomfort
[2:23:10] <waifoong98> what movie?
[2:23:12] <%ooblagis> WEAKNESS
[2:23:12] <%Solidnick18> it
[2:23:12] <%Plague_Nurse> too bad the movie is very underwhelming
[2:23:13] <%Superstarsage> It actually wasn't that bad where i watched it
[2:23:14] <%bevyrage> when a studio does final viewing before or after the pre-release showing, they watch the entire movie in a fully lit room. This is because they also have to watch it multiple times in a row.
[2:23:14] <Scorian> LUL
[2:23:14] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> i looked at it the entire time
[2:23:14] <+ArcanumMBD> WAIT WHAT
[2:23:15] <+AeonStorms> it was for the kids lol
[2:23:16] <%SaltyDongs> i stare at it regularly
[2:23:18] <%Rhinoprotoss> There was
[2:23:19] <%0dokuro> no youre right
[2:23:19] <straight_up_garbage> honestly it was actually pretty sytlish but that aside it was always gonna give people siezures
[2:23:20] <dukenux> yep. had epilepsy attack. shit like this make me look away.
[2:23:21] <evbites> yup
[2:23:22] <joylent_blue> nah you're right
[2:23:23] <$RaikenTB> FOR KIDS
[2:23:24] <+KanjiTatsumi> It wa
[2:23:25] <+PenmanLupine> ok old man
[2:23:26] <+FoolsArcade> agreement
[2:23:26] <+KanjiTatsumi> was
[2:23:27] <starotter70> wow
[2:23:27] <+ArcanumMBD> I refuse to believe that didn't have a warning from the start
[2:23:27] <alcors_wisdom> i didnt even register that as seizure inducing but maybe thats because i saw it at a drive-in
[2:23:28] <+d00msdaydan> no you don't sound like an old man that shit's optimized for seizures
[2:23:28] <%MakotoPB> yep saw it right away and didn't see any warnings
[2:23:28] <angelmorphic> no raisin
[2:23:29] <+Grayhammatter> you're right
[2:23:29] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Why would they do that?
[2:23:30] <Conky89> Pixar is turning into a sequel machine. It was pretty obvious that they had no plans for a Toy Story 4 originally.
[2:23:30] <KeiPrime> screensaver
[2:23:32] <%doc_ock_rokc> Khorne has no love for the weak!
[2:23:32] <PSI_Guy95> I'm more surprised Disney let it go past
[2:23:32] <%Das_Bass> boomer!
[2:23:33] <Yeajow> Was there one on netflix?
[2:23:33] <zebexter> You know, for kids
[2:23:33] <KeiPrime> that shit is ridic
[2:23:34] <%yeknomlive> i've been playing mhgu everytime a flash goes off i literally have to shut my eyes it's so bright
[2:23:35] <+whackerica> did it actually cause any seizures?
[2:23:35] <%kewlmyc> No, it was pretty rough. I winced a little bit
[2:23:36] <%SaltyDongs> no it's fine
[2:23:36] <redsynod> "Then die"
[2:23:37] <%Cthulos> was this incredibles 2?
[2:23:38] <horsesaredumb> what an old man smh
[2:23:39] <$daveronald> shut up old man
[2:23:41] <%MagickBurritoh> immediately sober
[2:23:41] <reinbachthe3rd> It's for the kids, Pat. Kids love seizures.
[2:23:42] <%ooblagis> He got sober fast
[2:23:43] <knyttstories> But that scene was awesome!
[2:23:43] <+KanjiTatsumi> Kreygasm

[2:24:22] <nelsonq415> how bout just a chin beard
[2:24:23] <+JollyHeracross> @krymzen5 but it's bigger than little beard's
[2:24:25] <%bevyrage> @AngriestPat it's because final review of a film before the press showing (and even sometimes during a press showing) they watch the film in a fully lit room. They legit would not have been subjected to the same visual stimulus as the theater going consumer.
[2:24:26] <dukenux> BANE?

[2:24:59] <%BonewheelVanguard> @WorstCompany and that right there is fantastic character writing.
[2:24:59] <%PlainSimpleTailor> The original has a horrifying Ubermensch subtext to it though...
[2:25:01] <%doc_ock_rokc> That isn't ENTIRELY true
[2:25:02] <Estuko> call me lower beard Kappa
[2:25:02] <PSI_Guy95> HOW do you let that get past
[2:25:02] <FracturedImage> Isle of Dogs was better
[2:25:02] <%Ion_LaserX> that explains a lot...
[2:25:04] <%weissguard> But why though.
[2:25:04] <krymzen5> that seems like an oversight

[2:31:22] <WorstCompany> @bonewheelvanguard that reminds me, I need to look up the item id for Cass’s hat; kinda wanna console spawn a copy of it for me next time I play.
[2:31:26] <%Gray_skies1993> @AngriestPat Pat maybe wait and see if they're actually with you?

[2:39:03] <+Galactor123> Yeah, in general Gommorah I'd say is probably the single worst area in New Vegas in terms of just how much clearly was supposed to be here, and how much clearly isn't here.
[2:39:05] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Wow you can even hear the muffled sex sounds

[2:40:03] <+Galactor123> @TheSpiritof2277 At least the Legion camps have some decent NPCs. And Caesar himself, while a shitlord, is a good character as a shitlord.

[2:40:47] <Conky89> The Legion are clearly underdeveloped. If only Obsidian didn't get just 18 months to make this game.
[2:40:49] <+reddpop_> how much of this game is left?

[2:41:20] <%TheSpiritof2277> @Galactor123 Yeah, can't say the same for the Omertas--you're right. I do know there was a lot more with the Legion at Cottonwood and other locations, pretty sure there's a mod which restores a boatload of stuff related to sidequests with them that simply aren't there in vanilla

[3:13:08] <%MagickBurritoh> Time to restart the game
[3:13:14] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat you never established a truce between the two. Need more NCR quest,
[3:13:16] <+TheHeroAppears> @Nobrev that's the nicest version of them though
[3:13:16] <%PlainSimpleTailor> BOS does nothing in this game tho, way cooler in 4
[3:13:20] <%0dokuro> theyll all die in the end anyway
[3:13:24] <+justicevi4> You didn't truce them @AngriestPat

[3:13:32] <zebexter> I feel like every character is full of shit in fallout
[3:13:32] <linklol321> But you have to kill them to progress in houses line

[3:14:18] <playdohface> @angriestpat No, HE wants you destroy the NCR

[3:14:56] <alrobot2014> @AngriestPat did you put hardin in power of the brotherhood
[3:14:57] <%Tarcanist_> The NCR are a bunch of corrupt bureaucrats, the legion is a bunch fascists and mr. House is a single money hungry dictator. the only true way is a free NV with upgraded securitrons
[3:14:58] <DeanX27> Now we need Made In Heaven though Kappa
[3:15:00] <zebexter> Pat do a bunnyhop
[3:15:00] <NumbusPlays> and he says "that doesn't actually solve the problem, though, they hate *me*"

[3:34:19] <$nademonkey1100> YEYEYEYEYEYE
[3:34:20] <%Cthulos> Nah, female Steve Blum is Mary Elizabeth McGlynn
[3:34:22] <supervyxen> don't betray the house
[3:34:24] <dekkitout> Why would he not do a solid TO HIS BEST CUSTOMERS?!
[3:34:25] <helpmeimafruit> just kill the most powerful man in new vegas by yourself citizen 4Head
[3:34:27] <%HyperCharge_Sam> this whole main story clan shit gets so repetitive
[3:34:41] <Conky89> That is a later quest
[3:34:43] <%0dokuro> What could that over sized CRT screen possibly be up to?
[3:34:46] <+Vagueon> Switch elders I think
[3:34:50] <%king_of_the_skies_dom> Brother hood is the last group through her
[3:34:51] <%TheSpiritof2277> Talk to McNamara I think
[3:34:51] <InugamiTheHound> has Elizabeth McGlynn been in any new anime?
[3:34:53] <Futurecity10> Kill house
[3:34:53] <%ooblagis> After House I tihnk
[3:34:57] <+ahegotrigger> you have to kill house first
[3:34:57] <%lewdskeletor13> It’s the Mr House, Clubhouse
[3:34:58] <%TheSpiritof2277> After all this bullshit
[3:34:59] <FracturedImage> brotherhood is the last group i think
[3:35:01] <+Delta593> If you kill House, do it with a Golf Club! Keep the current Elder to make the Brotherhood and NCR play nice.
[3:35:02] <+miguelrod777> weird
[3:35:02] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat Pat you must do what you do best Suck all the dicks
[3:35:03] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat you have to talk to the Elder again
[3:35:03] <ScreamingMeat> Help Elder MacNamara and ask him to for help when yuo get the quest
[3:35:04] <$nademonkey1100> yea change the elder
[3:35:06] <+ahegotrigger> its right after house
[3:35:13] <IcanConfuse> I think that is the brotherhood side.
[3:35:13] <Futurecity10> @AngriestPat You got the quests mixed up, after this quest is the quest to ally the brotherhood with ncr
[3:35:13] <%graffitisamurai> Dont switch elders
[3:35:16] <+Delta593> Don't change the Elder
[3:35:20] <%Cthulos> probably the new GitS on Netflix, Mary is more of a director now
[3:35:21] <%kiiiirsten> I think you have more game left than you thought you did
[3:35:22] <%Gray_skies1993> to everyone saying switch the elder, you're wrong
[3:35:22] <+justicevi4> Quest after killing House
[3:35:23] <+Delta593> They refuse to help if you change the Elder
[3:35:26] <%TheSpiritof2277> Switching elder's doesn't get it
[3:35:31] <$CharlesRobinJr> which one is house again
[3:35:31] <StromkoPenguin> I bet Pat will gain the loyalty of everyone and then screw over everyone to take power for himself.
[3:35:39] <%0dokuro> oof
[3:35:41] <Caidezes> LUL
[3:35:41] <%SmoochSpider> You need to do quests with brotherhood
[3:35:43] <helpmeimafruit> It never happened Kappa
[3:35:43] <%Cthulos> She was in (and directed) RE Revelaitons 2
[3:35:44] <+ahegotrigger> house is the walt disney looking asshole

[3:36:00] <$CharlesRobinJr> oooooo
[3:36:02] <drocadileguy> House is the monitor guy
[3:36:02] <FracturedImage> he finished the quests with the brotherhood
[3:36:09] <%Gray_skies1993> @AngriestPat it should still work if you go talk to them now?
[3:36:10] <%madhattergay> is michelle ruff female steve blum?
[3:36:24] <%Cthulos> Nah, Mary McGlynn is
[3:36:27] <dekkitout> "Boy. I told you to kill them."
[3:36:29] <%violetheart> Yeah, blow 'em up.
[3:36:29] <%0dokuro> I think he does ya
[3:36:31] <person181> sounds about right
[3:36:34] <%some_random_variable> I believe you can still do it
[3:36:34] <%Cthulos> More distinct
[3:36:35] <+dpython> aleksHa
[3:36:36] <waifoong98> Solution to all problem, just kill them LUL
[3:36:39] <%laserbeaming> Blow them up VoHiyo
[3:36:42] <KNEEGOOSE> yeah "talk to him"
[3:36:42] <%violetheart> Destroy them all.
[3:36:43] <%ThatGuyfromMars> I am not on your side]
[3:36:43] <OwlLightningMage> I remember what Pat is talking about
[3:36:44] <+ahegotrigger> that dialouge does exist
[3:36:44] <%Gray_skies1993> yeah at least see if you can do it, if not, oh well
[3:36:48] <supervyxen> BOS deserves do be blown up
[3:36:48] <%laserbeaming> Kill them all
[3:36:50] <%kiiiirsten> LUL
[3:36:51] <%TheSpiritof2277> Just blow up House's cock-tube, I'm with you
[3:36:53] <InugamiTheHound> good boy rex went back to his room
[3:36:54] <%Shadowthedigger> Pat; people hate the brotherhood in here though it seems.
[3:36:54] <wsintai> @AngriestPat Ive seen that dialogue, and hes STILL super right you tiny baby man
[3:36:55] <%kiiiirsten> apatWrong
[3:36:58] <+Emperor_Bad> ok but what if they need to be dead though
[3:36:59] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat you have to get up to idolized before you can ally them.
[3:37:00] <Meekest> In all fairness, killing them all is good
[3:37:03] <+Delta593> "I told you to 'talk' with the detonation sequence for their bunker, not with the elder you twit"
[3:37:04] <dekkitout> "What part of 'don't negotiate with terrorists'?"
[3:37:04] <EMP_Ike_Turner> Hello everyone
[3:37:06] <CrypticMochi> Fair enough, if thats how you progressed it
[3:37:08] <+Noxybaru> You definitely can't make peace with the Brotherhood and House
[3:37:11] <%joylent_blue> i mean if he calls you stupid, i can see that making anyone turn on him, regardless of how right he is LUL
[3:37:13] <%lewdskeletor13> House is an ass
[3:37:15] <Prism_Wing> "People will be on my side." seems like a cursed statement lol.
[3:37:16] <+ahegotrigger> pat doesnt hate the hate brotherhood
[3:37:20] <+preppyposs> @AngriestPat play DMC2 your friend max is streaming it be brave and strong like he is
[3:37:21] <%Reizie_Etherealm> A good wasteland is a wasteland that's completely uninhabited by people
[3:37:21] <linklol321> Hes not gonna take ANY risk
[3:37:24] <%laserbeaming> Kill both the brotherhood and House. None of them deserves air VoHiYo
[3:37:31] <%lewdskeletor13> He certainly doesn’t deserve to be the dictator of mankind’s future
[3:37:31] <wsintai> Friendzoned again!
[3:37:32] <$SGrim> @Noxybaru there's a mod to unlock the game files that solve that route.
[3:37:37] <+Delta593> I'm not sure you can get Idolized with the Brotherhood.
[3:37:41] <%Cthulos> House doesn't need air tho
[3:37:43] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> something something naruto
[3:37:44] <%TheSpiritof2277> I hate the Brotherhood, but House is more narcissistic and eccentric somehow
[3:37:45] <%Graywolf_the_45th> Kill em all Pater
[3:37:49] <%graffitisamurai> If you helped the brotherhood and didnt overthrow the elder they should agree to a truce
[3:37:52] <$SGrim> @Delta593 you absolutely can
[3:37:54] <%bread_assassin> @Delta593 You can, but you need the DLC.

[3:37:58] <Caidezes> Just kill everyone. All the factions suck.
[3:38:01] <InugamiTheHound> I remember siding with NCR and that's how I got them together. While in independent ignored them and killed off legion and saved great khans and boomers and forced the NCR out of new vegas
[3:38:04] <%laserbeaming> @Cthulos he kinda does, but he gets from a oxigen mask
[3:38:23] <%0dokuro> from the tubes inside his tube
[3:38:24] <%king_of_the_skies_dom> i believe thta doing the Followers side with Veronica prevents Idolized
[3:38:28] <$SGrim> @bread_assassin you don't need the DLC either, you just have to do the first missions you skip if you bring Veronica in.
[3:38:33] <%lewdskeletor13> Spit in Mr Houses tube Pat
[3:38:39] <+Delta593> @bread_assassin Right, because refusing to send out the nukes ensures that you can get more affinity with them.
[3:38:44] <suikudo> Woa woa he already did this
[3:38:44] <+Cavumentum> It has been BACKSLID
[3:38:47] <%laserbeaming> Kill Mr House with a golf club for more XP

[3:39:32] <James_Quivers> Pat, you need to go to the Hidden Valley Ranch to continue that questline
[3:39:35] <+Noxybaru> Game machine broke
[3:39:38] <%joylent_blue> new vegas, known to fall apart
[3:39:38] <wsintai> It would be so much easier if you just self-destructed them
[3:39:38] <Caidezes> The House Always Wins, Pat.
[3:39:40] <natebud> talk to the ambassador maybe
[3:39:42] <+Emperor_Bad> house is fucking with the timeline so you dont turn on him
[3:39:44] <%laserbeaming> Killing the brotherhood solves this problem
[3:39:45] <+someguy1472> To the what ranch?
[3:39:47] <%TheSpiritof2277> Trust me when I say the armistice between BoS and NCR is broken as fuck.
[3:39:48] <%lewdskeletor13> Burn the House doen
[3:39:52] <%lewdskeletor13> Down
[3:39:56] <%TheSpiritof2277> The game REALLY doesn't want it
[3:39:56] <Marco_Apollo> GOLF CLUB
[3:40:00] <%graffitisamurai> Wait did you even start that part Pat??
[3:40:00] <natebud> Oh yeah he never talked to house
[3:40:03] <%laserbeaming> Golf Club!
[3:40:04] <Fujiwara_92> GOLF CLUB
[3:40:04] <%Gray_skies1993> @AngriestPat you can't do it until after Moore gives you the quest I'm fairly certain, then the option should be there
[3:40:04] <$nademonkey1100> spit in his feeding tube
[3:40:13] <%lewdskeletor13> SPIT IN THE TUBE
[3:40:16] <OwlLightningMage> He didn't talk to House on this save yet
[3:40:18] <Conky89> I don't think this is a bug. The only way to get a truce is near the end of the NCR questline
[3:40:28] <Marco_Apollo> Kill house with the GOLF CLUB
[3:40:40] <+Delta593> Yeah, you can't get Idolized with the Brotherhood if you don't have the DLC. Just checked.
[3:40:44] <+Vagueon> failed for the repub
[3:40:51] <StromkoPenguin> It's funny that it locks off these questlines before you actually do a thing.
[3:40:53] <%0dokuro> its fine

[3:41:23] <dekkitout> This is just about Dark Souls endings level of clown shoes
[3:41:29] <%laserbeaming> If Obsidian had more time to make this game it maybe wouldn't be this confusing
[3:41:29] <%TheSpiritof2277> I'm more than certain you don't get this until like the final-stage when Moore brings it up
[3:41:29] <%lewdskeletor13> I’m excited to be a dumb character in Outer Worlds
[3:41:33] <%madhattergay> pat needs a "its fine" emote
[3:41:35] <%0dokuro> WATCH OUT
