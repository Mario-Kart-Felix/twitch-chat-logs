[0:07:12] <levitcleos> euph
[0:07:15] <%Frost_Quill> I'm still playing through World, about to enter Iceborne for the first time.  I'm always late playing games lol.

[0:07:17] <%ChrisPlaysThing> You butthole

[0:07:28] <%psidefx> So he beat the game
[0:07:29] <%Landralin1996> You don't say lmao
[0:07:29] <levitcleos> total euphemism
[0:07:32] <%UvBenServed> HE SAID THE THING
[0:07:32] <Frostydough1> POG HE SAID IT
[0:07:36] <gallohuegos> he said the line
[0:07:37] <%ChrisPlaysThing> low rank is NEVER worth
[0:07:45] <%valriot> I cant believe they just give you Adept Hammer and Longsword moveset
[0:07:50] <Ravioli_Ronin> Pat why did you personally delay the release of monhun?
[0:07:56] <gallohuegos> final boss looked cool
[0:08:03] <+OwlLightningMage> Low rank, more like, low rank. Because low means not very much already
[0:08:03] <bob900000> cool
[0:08:04] <%Ranryu692> so you got shit

[0:08:35] <+itsgundamu> Blasphemy
[0:08:38] <+D00msDayDan> that new 2risky2rainy character is real good
[0:08:39] <%floniac> floniac subscribed with Prime. 
[0:08:44] <%Ranryu692> they are
[0:08:44] <ergulor> BOO but ok
[0:08:45] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Risk of Rain is pretty fun
[0:08:46] <MonsterGills> Gungeon is free on PSN right now
[0:08:46] <%Frost_Quill> Gungeon I would say is about as fun as Isaac, but Hades absolutely stomps on them both.
[0:08:54] <redapache> Enter the Gungeon is still kicking my ass :(
[0:08:56] <PleaseCallMeSugar> did you encounter any monsters that weren't announced?
[0:08:56] <peyodogo> it's true, isaac's gone kinda to shit with the expansions adding too many shit items
[0:09:11] <PerfectPepperPlantPro> Imcredible timing. JUST finished yesterdays VOD
[0:09:11] <%Frost_Quill> What weapon are you maining Pat
[0:09:12] <Devbob98> Amazon delayed my order until tomorrow, i need my fix man
[0:09:15] <levitcleos> lol
[0:09:19] <%Ranryu692> fuck you too
[0:09:26] <Octocon> U tried duos yet?
[0:09:44] <ergulor> 700+ items?
[0:09:54] <Link232> Binding of Isaac only exists as a podcast engine for Northernlion
[0:10:06] <gallohuegos> They added a colostomy bag boss
[0:10:06] <+OwlLightningMage> Way too many items.
[0:10:08] <+AWr00tBear> I just started so no Pat squad
[0:10:09] <+CherteuseKapibara> lol EGG still forgets some of the trinkets
[0:10:14] <+D00msDayDan> it would be helpful if ingame descriptions said ANYTHING HELPFUL
[0:10:29] <%Frost_Quill> I watched like a hundred episodes of Northernlion playing Isaac and I still don't know what most shit does.
[0:10:47] <%Psykoknight65> Psykoknight65 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! 
[0:10:51] <+D00msDayDan> risk of rain's logbook tells you how every item scales with stacks, with numbers and percentages!
[0:10:52] <peyodogo> i think there's a mod that does that? but the thing is that even a lot of the hardcore isaac people have left it because of item bloat
[0:11:16] <PerfectPepperPlantPro> Yeah, having a good run of Isaac, finding an unknown item late game, and it ruining everything was frustrating as dicks
[0:11:23] <+itsgundamu> Gungeons upgrades just don't feel as extreme as Issac, thats my only gripe
[0:11:23] <%Frost_Quill> Isaac: Rebirth was the best the series ever was in my opinion.
[0:11:33] <%Alazull> I could see it
[0:11:33] <%holydeviant1> Gungeon is JUST RIGHT
[0:11:34] <Blank9> noita's my go-to still
[0:11:35] <%valriot> Ehhh, Gungeon gets REALLY repetative
[0:11:36] <bob900000> what makes it better?
[0:11:37] <+lcl_mayhem_lcl> Hey Pat, how’re you liking Rise so far?
[0:11:38] <MelfinaStarwind> half of the dev time of repentance was rebalancing the existing Isaac stuff
[0:11:42] <penitentpendant> Also, I feel I could beat the bosses with enough skill with the base gun in Gungeon as opposed to just gonna die if I go into a boss room w/o the right upgrades in Isaac.
[0:11:46] <+allups> guneon is my favorite of all those types of games
[0:11:49] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> !uptime
[0:11:49] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 12m 8s.
[0:11:51] <karovus> gungeon makes me wish i liked roguelikes
[0:11:53] <Devbob98> I agree with that, gungeon is always fun
[0:11:57] <Ravioli_Ronin> That’s heresy
[0:11:59] <%Alazull> Hammer is meant for fight
[0:12:02] <+OwlLightningMage> I wish Gungeon felt a little less repetitive
[0:12:12] <%slapjones> slapjones subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months! What's your favourite Monster Hunter clone. I like the mobility of God eater myself.
[0:12:20] <%holydeviant1> TASTE THE CURB, BAGGI, TASTE IT
[0:12:31] <TheAntiNihilist> Hades is great but definitely overrated
[0:12:32] <%maenos2> saggy balls
[0:12:33] <%Alazull> In her purse?
[0:12:34] <bob900000> she is pure
[0:12:36] <PerfectPepperPlantPro> It's like 5 centimeters apart
[0:12:38] <penitentpendant> She knows where "The Orb" is and that's it
[0:12:40] <ergulor> Gungeon is way too repetitive for me, that's why i like isaac, all the same zones adn enemies and bosses bores me
[0:12:40] <%walternatorz> ohno
[0:12:50] <%batpick> Have you ever heard of a game that was hurt by its own excess of content.
[0:12:52] <ergulor> still gungeon rocks
[0:12:56] <PanicSwytch> Amazon still hasn't shipped my copy of MHR
[0:12:57] <%Frost_Quill> I hate how good the greatsword is, I want to play more complicated weapons like chargeblade but greatsword feels the best.
[0:12:58] <+sekshun789> Hey Pat! Just got off work and stopped by, just wondering if you’ve ever played the Star Wars Force Unleashed games or if you’d ever stream them by chance

[0:14:24] <bob900000> Sean got super nerefed in 3rd strike
[0:14:25] <+OwlLightningMage> Is Toukiden good?
[0:14:30] <%Frost_Quill> Is Souls stuff actually a MH clone?
[0:14:34] <+HibikiYamada> Toukiden is a close 2nd imo
[0:14:39] <badhaye> maaan i miss Soul Sacrifice

[0:16:26] <atomblazer> Have you tried any of the ranged weapons?
[0:16:31] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> man I can't wait for the pc port

[0:18:44] <%Alazull> How much extra damage
[0:18:45] <%Alazull> Nice
[0:18:47] <$Afterman_> higher number = more damage
[0:18:48] <yourliteraldog> I want to fight monstars not read spread sheets
[0:18:52] <Mattais88> Hit the bunny on the ass
[0:18:53] <PerfectPepperPlantPro> Boy I had to MAKE this guide back for Freedom Unite. Nice that its just here now

[0:18:54] <%BoxNavy> oh what an actual damage table in the game?
[0:19:03] <redapache> So this is only missing the rare part drop rates right? or is that in the notebook as well?

[0:20:01] <HellboundHeartless> this is already really intimidating for my noob brain

[0:21:10] <Mattais88> Who is that?
[0:21:13] <%BoxNavy> that might list the quests you can do to get that reward????
[0:21:14] <sonofthedeepsouth> should take 10 tbh
[0:21:16] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> captures or kills?
[0:21:19] <%BoxNavy> i dunno

[0:22:52] <sonofthedeepsouth> the orient
[0:22:56] <%BoxNavy> oh you unlocked the new move? how?
[0:22:58] <%Alazull> Dude the Giant Wirebug spots are huge. Open up so many options for movement through the map
[0:23:02] <KasiCrafter> World BUT with more stuff, cooler moves, and aSIA? sO. mONSTER hUNTER, THEN? kAPPA
[0:23:03] <PleaseCallMeSugar> World and Generations had a perfect child, and they grew up to be a gargantuan weeb
[0:23:04] <%Landralin1996> I loved that tackle move
[0:23:04] <yourliteraldog> Nippon
[0:23:13] <KasiCrafter> Caps now I look like a fool
[0:23:19] <%Teyaric> does it seriously run better overall than World? and look cleaner?
[0:23:26] <+MrKerb> How many maps does this have?
[0:23:27] <%Alazull> Yo I saw that in the ice map
[0:23:32] <%Alazull> With no interaction
[0:23:35] <MayorRev> This might be a silly question but is it optimized on switch?
[0:23:49] <Namillus> It's a clean 30
[0:23:51] <KasiCrafter> Was there a Palico by that cat?
[0:23:52] <PerfectPepperPlantPro> REengine fuck yeah
[0:23:59] <KasiCrafter> *cart
[0:24:00] <%GinAndRoses> like butter
[0:24:02] <%holydeviant1> How is it portable?
[0:24:02] <%Teyaric> I mean visual noise- sparkling and dust everywhere in world drove me nuts
[0:24:03] <+itsgundamu> yea I feel this would run half as well on the old engine

[0:24:27] <sonofthedeepsouth> good
[0:24:27] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> I feel like the 3ds stuff ran well
[0:24:32] <Blank9> iceborne wouldn't even run on my 970, when base world would
[0:24:37] <Devbob98> One of the best switch games I’ve seen
[0:24:43] <+BradshawMcCaw> i get 120 fps 1080 without any drops on pc
[0:24:45] <PleaseCallMeSugar> Iceborne runs like diarrhea
[0:24:46] <yourliteraldog> That RE Engine slaps did capcom clone John Carmak or something
[0:24:46] <vVAstrAVv> is this part 1?
[0:24:46] <+itsgundamu> only hiccups I've had is running really quick through the environment but I've never had frame drops in a fight
[0:24:57] <+theballad_tft> Just wait LUL
[0:24:59] <Kief_Meister> Can someone explain to me the appeal of these games? I always find the bosses not having a life bar fucks with me as it feels like I'm not doing anything
[0:25:04] <%holydeviant1> Rajang is tho
[0:25:04] <%YakumoYomi> Which is a shame, because base World ran pretty well on PC...and the Iceborne update seemed to tank performance across the board
[0:25:05] <%Ynkubus_> yet...
[0:25:07] <sonofthedeepsouth> I like some monsters are endemic
[0:25:15] <sonofthedeepsouth> I don't believe you

[0:25:36] <%whyskeywolfe> Yeah I think this one might be easier than world.
[0:25:37] <yourliteraldog> Kill monster then wear it's flesh. Kill bigger monster for funny hats
[0:25:37] <T_Sasquatch> @Kief_Meister kill boss , get cool armor , get cool weapon , rinse and repeat
[0:25:37] <%ssjklyco> How are load times compared to World?
[0:25:40] <+HibikiYamada> yo that greatsword looks sick

[0:25:48] <+thechungiestofbois> What monster did you grind for all this Pat
[0:26:00] <Kief_Meister> @PleaseCallMeSugar Is it major changes in behavior or??? cause I still feel a sense of doing jack shit lmao
[0:26:01] <+Seitine> Reminds me of Okami music.
[0:26:01] <PleaseCallMeSugar> that's the Aknosom gear
[0:26:05] <+thechungiestofbois> the bird?
[0:26:07] <Kief_Meister> @T_Sasquatch makes sense
[0:26:11] <+HibikiYamada> are the weapons actually good looking this time around?
[0:26:16] <%Frost_Quill> What
[0:26:23] <iron1k21> first time watching the stream always been on YouTube

[0:26:39] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> huh, interesting change
[0:26:42] <Blank9> fuck melding
[0:26:43] <PleaseCallMeSugar> @kief_meister not MASSIVE, but their attack patterns will change, they'll stagger and tire, pause, flee, limp, etc

[0:28:43] <PleaseCallMeSugar> @kief_meister the game will also give you feedback somewhere, usually on the map, of when a monster is weak, enraged, fleeing, ready to capture, etc. It's less obtrusive, but also harder to notice.

[0:30:04] <sonofthedeepsouth> it wont come for other consoles

[0:30:07] <+D00msDayDan> unless they saddle it with garbage anticheat again
[0:30:07] <%rumtumtugnutz> "It's got to be this one." This one is called LEG DAY
[0:30:08] <sonofthedeepsouth> I bet

[0:30:48] <DublinRage> is that a baby triceratops?!
[0:30:52] <antshadow14> bird up
[0:31:03] <%YakumoYomi> @ssjklyco Hopefully, the fact that it's running on RE engine means that won't happen (as all the RE engine games on PC run well)
[0:31:07] <CrimsonGargoyle> BORD BOP
[0:31:08] <%sumrand0> BIRDUP
[0:31:09] <+BlackSunEmperor> i vastly prefer this aesthetic to world
[0:31:09] <%KineticZen> I love how Kulu-Ya-Ku has to shit talk the guy who ran into a wall

[0:31:11] <+Left_Justified> atpBird
[0:31:11] <Mattais88> Would this be 6th gen then?
[0:31:12] <%Monkeyweed21> 5th gen is way better than 3rd gen
[0:31:16] <Blank9> soft spot for 3rd gen still
[0:31:18] <%hrbeck_> World had a lot of hits
[0:31:18] <yourliteraldog> BIRB
[0:31:19] <%MegboyManuel> MegboyManuel subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 28 months! reminder that the psa discord originally started out as a monster hunter discord. thats hilarious. by the way, I hope this game comes with updates and expansions just like World, it deserves the love
[0:31:23] <Warbot40> Was glavenous 5th gen?
[0:31:24] <sonofthedeepsouth> Chat. Rathalos and Rathian don't need to be in every game
[0:31:24] <Blank9> I miss baby uragaan, that was the best
[0:31:32] <%Megaleg> I hope odog returns
[0:31:36] <sonofthedeepsouth> We can live without lover dragons
[0:31:39] <+theballad_tft> Yo the mobility in this game is so fucking good
[0:31:41] <%Monkeyweed21> @Mattais88 this is still 5th gen like how Generations was still 4th gen
[0:31:41] <%toastybites> kestadon more like kesta-gone ami righ
[0:31:42] <%hrbeck_> Glavenous was Generations
[0:31:48] <yourliteraldog> Bird would be so scary if they where real.
[0:31:49] <%CalderGaming> i can't get over this hunter voice. every time.
[0:31:51] <Blank9> oh this is just straight up desert from 3
[0:31:53] <PleaseCallMeSugar> odie will probably come back, considering the game's vibe and direction
[0:31:53] <OneThousandTomatoes> this area not having loading zones is weird
[0:31:53] <PerfectPepperPlantPro> Spicy strawberries? I can get into that
[0:32:04] <Warbot40> Dodogama was adorable.
[0:32:04] <DublinRage> @sonofthedeepsouth too bad we're getting both, then ;D
[0:32:06] <%Frost_Quill> Does picking up the buffs from little bugs all over the map get annoying?
[0:32:06] <%YakumoYomi> Rise is more like "Portable 5th Gen"
[0:32:16] <%sumrand0> But.... according to reddit though MHW and Iceborne are "trash" baby games for babies. are you saying anonymous people online are idiots?
[0:32:21] <+HibikiYamada> the fucking voice acting reminds me of cookie monster
[0:32:26] <%sumrand0> lol
[0:32:26] <YamChop> hunters voice gives off "why is it spicy" vibes
[0:32:27] <sonofthedeepsouth> @DublinRage No big suprise
[0:32:34] <OneThousandTomatoes> @frost_quill why would it?
[0:32:43] <KasiCrafter> That animation is NOT 30FPS, lol
[0:33:00] <+cappyd33> pat's hunter sounds like more raspy barrett
[0:33:00] <CrimsonGargoyle> traversal looks a lot more fun
[0:33:01] <Oxybe> @PatStaresAt i got like 7 of those lore scrolls by exploring the first area, it's nuts where ther eare little nooks hidden around
[0:33:02] <%rumtumtugnutz> I still think Patron sounds like a street shark.
[0:33:03] <CrimsonGargoyle> so much more fun
[0:33:05] <%Monkeyweed21> @sumrand0 MonHun purists are dumber than One Piece power scalers
[0:33:05] <sonofthedeepsouth> Monster hunter should go back to its arcane and overcomplicated roots Kappa
[0:33:11] <+Pequod1> For a split second I thought this was Twilight Princess
[0:33:11] <$Dakuu75> oh gawd, it's that freak that hits you with a rock. lol
[0:33:23] <CrimsonGargoyle> catJAM
[0:33:26] <%sumrand0> @monkeyweed21 THATS SUCH A GOOD DESCRIPTION
[0:33:28] <DublinRage> yo that Aknosom GS looks great
[0:33:35] <Warbot40> Is this area new? It kind of reminds me of an area from tri.
[0:33:40] <mike2hands> !uptime
[0:33:40] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 33m 59s.
[0:33:41] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @Pequod1 midna skin for palico when
[0:33:52] <OneThousandTomatoes> turned off guard tackle?
[0:33:52] <+Meta1spy51> zangief can read?
[0:33:59] <mike2hands> Hi pat , hi chat
[0:34:02] <Sarcastastic> thats such a wicked looking set and sword
[0:34:12] <papershuriken_0> @Warbot40 yea, its actually a remake of sandy plains from tri, even has the same name.
[0:34:14] <CrimsonGargoyle> hi mike
[0:34:17] <$Dakuu75> "Hm, how can we make this knife better?"< "MAKE IT FUCKING, EXPLODE~!"
[0:34:24] <CrimsonGargoyle> @Monkeyweed21 i don't know what that means, but that's funny
[0:34:31] <Zombrocom> This theme is amazing
[0:34:39] <+Pequod1> @KosOrSomeSayKosm_ oof why you gotta make up things that'll never happen but are cool
[0:34:40] <CrimsonGargoyle> @Dakuu75 works EVERY time
[0:34:47] <DublinRage> @kosorsomesaykosm_ now I want Wolf Link *AND* Amaterasu Palamute skins
[0:34:56] <%Grimlockfly> KILL THAT ASSHOLE CHICKEN. SwiftRage500
[0:35:08] <%walternatorz> why does zangief get all the cool stuff? what about elmo?
[0:35:09] <yourliteraldog> @PerfectPepperPlantPro Go to a mexican market and pick Chile y Limon shaker. It's full a nice spice mixture meant for fruits and veg.  Test best on sweet fruits like mango.
[0:35:09] <%cache_22> Will there be an Umbrella Corp. skin for the umbrella at some point?
[0:35:26] <DublinRage> quick! someone check if the Wolf Link amiibo gives you that!
[0:35:26] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> there was a legend of zelda set in 4u so hey, maybe
[0:35:26] <Blank9> I want an astral chain crossover, beast legion and chain wirebugs
[0:35:28] <CrimsonGargoyle> better be LUL
[0:35:30] <%Kobrafan79> Kobrafan79 subscribed with Prime. 
[0:35:31] <CrimsonGargoyle> elmo is doing his best
[0:35:32] <%Monkeyweed21> @CrimsonGargoyle One Piece is all about wierdo powers and bullshit matchups, talking about power scaling likes its DBZ is dumber than doing the same for Jojo
[0:35:38] <Wizardism> It looks like they reused a few assets from MHW
[0:35:57] <%MugenSandan> Does the Dog now have more ninja tools than Sekiro
[0:36:07] <shotgang86> Reuse of assets is the rule of Monster Hunter
[0:36:10] <+Pequod1> Aw man is there a hunter-ese option the english is... offputting
[0:36:10] <%MugenSandan> cause that's SICK
[0:36:11] <CrimsonGargoyle> @Monkeyweed21 ooh, you didn't have to but thanks for explaining LUL
[0:36:12] <%Ynkubus_> MH games in the same generation always reuse assests
[0:36:14] <sonofthedeepsouth> kill em all pat
[0:36:24] <yourliteraldog> wiff
[0:36:25] <%Frost_Quill> It also looks sick with that armor.
[0:36:43] <%sumrand0> lol nothing say new MH like "Yo check that green sharpness guage!"
[0:36:44] <$Dakuu75> omg, starting with all these weak-sauce sharpness in a new game. lol
[0:36:49] <Zombrocom> Reusing assets lets them have more total content. No need to remake things if the assets they already have are already good.
[0:36:51] <shotgang86> I mean Plesioth got made one time and stayed that way up until Generations Ultimate
[0:36:56] <DublinRage> what are those things on the shady wall?
[0:36:57] <%hrbeck_> *misses again* never change, Pat. GS bros forever
[0:37:07] <%KineticZen> The "dumb guy" voice is something
[0:37:16] <Frostydough1> How long until Monster Hunter pulls the old "The real monster was man" & just straight up gives you a bloodborne hunter boss fight, it would be the SICKEST
[0:37:19] <CrimsonGargoyle> SourPls
[0:37:20] <ergulor> Chicken down
[0:37:25] <yourliteraldog> Bro dude hunter
[0:37:25] <+HibikiYamada> wow what, that trap range was huge

[0:37:30] <%SShen> ew non monhun language voices
[0:37:31] <OneThousandTomatoes> you have infinite throwing knives
[0:37:32] <shotgang86> Huh it says "hunted" not "captured"
[0:37:35] <%Monkeyweed21> LOW RANK BB
[0:37:41] <%SShen> the movie
[0:37:45] <%sumrand0> @frostydough1 did u mean the dumbest?
[0:37:48] <%Megaleg> @sshen agreed
[0:37:50] <yourliteraldog> gun dragon
[0:37:53] <$Dakuu75> that sounds wicked
[0:37:59] <%Monkeyweed21> Ahtal Ka did that @PatStaresAt
[0:38:00] <%hrbeck_> That's the undertone, Gogamazios
[0:38:01] <%YakumoYomi> Hand of GOG
[0:38:03] <KaiserMario> What's the name again?
[0:38:06] <CrimsonGargoyle> @Frostydough1 isn't that the whole lore LUL
[0:38:07] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> gog was cool, it's equipment looked S I C K
[0:38:07] <penitentpendant> Imagining a Blood Starved Beast fight in MonHun
[0:38:07] <%Frost_Quill> There's something in the backstory about how the monsters wiped out most of humanity because humanity were doing horrible shit to the world, right???
[0:38:09] <+SoySocks> Hexus
[0:38:11] <%YakumoYomi> Hexus?
[0:38:14] <$Dakuu75> OMFG, I can picture that SO PERFECTLY
[0:38:16] <Zombrocom> There is that equal dragon weapon thing, the man made elder dragon. maybe that will show up one day
[0:38:19] <sonofthedeepsouth> toxic love
[0:38:22] <%Monkeyweed21> Ahtal Ka straight up did mecha shit
[0:38:25] <+Pequod1> *I like to play monster hunter but I can't play it because it makes me sad to hurt the cool monsters*
[0:38:30] <Mattais88> That the first time?
[0:38:36] <%hrbeck_> Most fucked monsters are genetically engineered by the Predecessors
[0:38:37] <DublinRage> Pat have you met Magnamalo in the game yet?
[0:38:38] <%BoxNavy> tower defense baby
[0:38:40] <%Ynkubus_> MH only brings out the man/wyverians can also be horrid in certain quests/events
[0:38:41] <DublinRage> *story
[0:38:44] <%BoxNavy> its bloons
[0:38:49] <sonofthedeepsouth> ye
[0:38:50] <%KineticZen> are you The Rock
[0:38:57] <%Monkeyweed21> FUCK KINSTONES
[0:38:59] <%Alazull> I mean all of Monster Hunter's backstory is like Man is the real monster, but it happened long before MH1
[0:39:00] <%ssjklyco> You gotta Rampage to become the Apex Legend
[0:39:09] <%MugenSandan> What do you think are the chances Gore Magala will show up in DLC or something considering Gore is also associated with a rage virus?
[0:39:09] <yourliteraldog> Japanese Elfs
[0:39:12] <+Double_Tap_That> What about the odds of getting a humanoid with a weapon-based moveset, like Dark Souls?
[0:39:14] <OneThousandTomatoes> no hes macho man
[0:39:15] <Ravioli_Ronin> I just downloaded the demo, and I love how they don’t give you any sort of controls tutorial and only 30 mins
[0:39:29] <sonofthedeepsouth> Pat explain to me in a 4 hour long video the lore of Monster Hunter
[0:39:31] <yourliteraldog> Angry about Japanese Elfs
[0:39:36] <T_Sasquatch> @DOUB
[0:39:37] <redapache> man I miss Dalamadur
[0:39:39] <%SharkMissile> Doggos :U
[0:39:42] <%FlamingNarwhal> gore is so fucking cool. shame it never made it to world
[0:39:43] <T_Sasquatch> @Double_Tap_That Never
[0:39:52] <%Monkeyweed21> if they add Gore, they need to add Shagaru too
[0:39:56] <%SShen> You can rename them when you hire them yes
[0:39:59] <%MugenSandan> I feel like it's a decent chance considering THE RAMPAGE is the story mechanic
[0:40:05] <CrimsonGargoyle> YOU LIKE CRIT? WE GOT IT
[0:40:07] <%Frost_Quill> Is Plague into Monster Hunter?  Are there any videos where he talks about their dicks?
[0:40:08] <sonofthedeepsouth> yo
[0:40:09] <%BoxNavy> :)
[0:40:13] <sonofthedeepsouth> Thats a good dog
[0:40:15] <yourliteraldog> Gang Geif
[0:40:18] <$Dakuu75> @Double_Tap_That Ehh, the put the Lesh monster in MHW from the Witcher franchise. that was the only "humanoid"-ish thing I can think of
[0:40:27] <%FlamingNarwhal> @Frost_Quill he pretty much hates it actually
[0:40:33] <%Adojim> Adojim subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 18 months! 
[0:40:37] <+theballad_tft> What is this nier ass music and why is it so good!
[0:40:39] <%Frost_Quill> @FlamingNarwhal Damn.
[0:40:43] <%Monkeyweed21> I love seeing dogs that look related to my dog
[0:40:53] <T_Sasquatch> oops all zangiefs
[0:41:06] <aiutare47> @flamingnarwhal But what are his thoughts on the dicks?
[0:41:28] <%Monkeyweed21> @Frost_Quill he compared playing MHW to being in a burning house and when you complain that the house is on fire the MH veterans say it used to be way worse
[0:41:38] <PanicSwytch> The Juice is loose
[0:41:39] <%MisterRockett> I can't believe they brought back the Palico training I'm so glad Woolie will get to finally experience this.
[0:41:42] <yourliteraldog> What Monster would have the biggest dick
[0:41:47] <%solracc25> \
[0:41:49] <+theballad_tft> D:
[0:41:57] <%SShen> Thank god it doesn't have the sonic chao dismissal cutscene
[0:41:59] <%MegboyManuel> ITS ME
[0:42:03] <%MegboyManuel> HE HAS ME AS A CAT
[0:42:04] <OneThousandTomatoes> pat are you collecting stuff from the cohoot nest?
[0:42:07] <sonofthedeepsouth> pat abandons em
[0:42:07] <yourliteraldog> Which would have the scariest dick>
[0:42:17] <+Pequod1> Yo hows the town design in this one do the multiplayer lobbies have stuff in them?
[0:42:17] <+Frost_Quill> @yourliteraldog Anjanath probably.  T-Rexes had like 12 foot ones.
[0:42:40] <%MisterRockett> @yourliteraldog There's World mods that add dicks. I'm assuming in order of which the modder found the hottest.
[0:42:44] <$Dakuu75> Did anyone watch Max play this last night? I wanna know if he spoke to the cats hitting the drums? the ones with those sic-bars, lol
[0:42:45] <%Monkeyweed21> @Pequod1 maybe even better than Iceborne, way better than base World
[0:42:57] <%Xevtes> @PatStaresAt will the PC port have a higher frame rate?
[0:43:11] <OneThousandTomatoes> well in multiplayer people walk around the village
[0:43:12] <%Frost_Quill> Oh it's ALWAYS dango.
[0:43:21] <+Pequod1> @Monkeyweed21 how bout cutscenes? they still bad?
[0:43:27] <%primarch_lupercal> @dakuu75 no but he found other cute shit
[0:43:36] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> perfect
[0:43:38] <+cade_calrayn> God those happy kitties are so fucking cute
[0:43:43] <bigshedman> Where the Meowscular chef at?!
[0:43:45] <OneThousandTomatoes> still pretty good
[0:43:45] <DublinRage> Pat and Chat: I just got back from work and Rise finished downloading. is there anything I should know before I start?
[0:43:48] <%Tenchi_G> Dango, Dango
[0:43:49] <%Alazull> I kind of do miss the feasts from World
[0:43:51] <%bluetocho13> why you have 2 birds?
[0:43:54] <%YakumoYomi> Oh hai doggy
[0:43:56] <%Megaleg> Lol that’s way better than the single player one
[0:43:59] <KillswitchLikesToPlay> nom nom nom
[0:43:59] <Mattais88> Judgement Cutitng dango is pretty sick
[0:44:00] <+Left_Justified> more toxoplasmosis atpFeelsBeardMan
[0:44:01] <%MugenSandan> Imma be real I hope there's more than Dango cause I love all the crazy meals like the seasonal ones from world
[0:44:03] <%CalderGaming> @bigshedman completely different part of the world
[0:44:06] <Zombrocom> I like the Knight, Horse and Squire thing your squad has going on here
[0:44:09] <%Frost_Quill> Are the dango as nutritious as the muscle cat's giant meat dishes?
[0:44:12] <$Dakuu75> @primarch_lupercal ah ok, cool.
[0:44:14] <%Monkeyweed21> @Pequod1 they fixed the cutscenes in multiplayer, they just play for everyone at the start of the mission if there's a first timer
[0:44:24] <yourliteraldog> @Frost_Quill I thought that palentologist now think that dinosaurs didn't have dicks but male clocaslike mostbirds
[0:44:26] <bigshedman> @CalderGaming No but I want him tho
[0:44:33] <aiutare47> I just noticed, what’s up with pats character looking like a wack-ass Commander Shepard?
[0:44:35] <jotabranded> LUL
[0:44:37] <skagtheprinceofhell> "We have GUNS!"
[0:44:37] <$Dakuu75> omg, I love this corny-ass-shit, lol
[0:44:38] <%CalderGaming> lul
[0:44:38] <DestroPrime83> wow these scenes are WAAAAAY better in MH language
[0:44:45] <PanicSwytch> Was that a haiku?
[0:44:47] <OneThousandTomatoes> @dublinrage theres a lot of good options so look through em
[0:44:50] <%KineticZen> ...can I turn Monster Hunter language on
[0:44:51] <sonofthedeepsouth> Man vs nature but Man actually is not the bad guy
[0:45:01] <%MisterRockett> It's weird coming from Dragon Quest Builders 2 to this since that game has a tower defense mechanic where you build all of the traps.
[0:45:02] <Tracazoid> Oh he's Ace now? I preferred Squirt.
[0:45:06] <%Frost_Quill> @yourliteraldog Yeah but that's the boring option.  It's way funner to think that had massive monster schlongs.
[0:45:06] <Symmy_> nothing to fear top tier even the translation is rhyming
[0:45:06] <Wizardism> Strider?
[0:45:07] <+Pequod1> @Monkeyweed21 nice
[0:45:09] <+TheIntellectional> fuck nature, shoot it with cannons
[0:45:11] <skagtheprinceofhell> @PanicSwytch Probably is in Japanese but that was just rhyming
[0:45:21] <+Agentoracle> Man Vs. Nature but Nature is a cheating bastard with brass knuckles.
[0:45:24] <%Megaleg> Your hunter sounds like kuwabara
[0:45:28] <OneThousandTomatoes> hope this runs well with multiple monsters
[0:45:39] <DestroPrime83> never played MHw with MH language on, wonder what it sounds like?
[0:45:44] <skagtheprinceofhell> @Agentoracle So we use GUNS to level the playing field.
[0:45:45] <%Frost_Quill> OH what, wasn't expecting this in the game.
[0:45:48] <MayorRev> never played monster hunter before and the tutorial for rise didnt really explain much for me, what do you recommend for new players to learn?
[0:45:53] <+GnarlyJarlie> this runs at 30fps right?
[0:46:04] <Manwad> anything
[0:46:11] <%ssjklyco> Dual blades
[0:46:16] <%MegboyManuel> Dont be a coward and use Meg as your cat
[0:46:18] <+Left_Justified> gitting gud LUL
[0:46:19] <+0raison> training room
[0:46:21] <Silly_Duckling> We're so deep in at this point, it's sink or swim
[0:46:22] <skagtheprinceofhell> I mean, they have more tutorials.
[0:46:23] <CrimsonGargoyle> tower defence sbfpSetIn
[0:46:23] <PerfectPepperPlantPro> Lance. Poke Poke Poke
[0:46:26] <penitentpendant> "What do your recommend?" "Yes."
[0:46:30] <T_Sasquatch> whatever weapons looks cool
[0:46:30] <skagtheprinceofhell> You have the training room
[0:46:31] <MayorRev> oh ok
[0:46:34] <BlacSoul> Pick what you want, all of the things work differently
[0:46:34] <%BoxNavy> watch arekkz or gaijinhunters weapon guides and see what weapons look cool to you
[0:46:34] <mike2hands> Train with every weapon
[0:46:38] <OneThousandTomatoes> to experienced people its easy
[0:46:39] <$Monkeyweed21> Sword and Shield is the best starter weapon, but use what you prefer
[0:46:49] <DestroPrime83> DUDE that monster spreadsheet shit is banas
[0:46:59] <MayorRev> gotcha
[0:47:01] <%MegboyManuel> Sword and Shield is the best beginner weapon yeah
[0:47:04] <%Monkeyweed21> Low Rank is so easy even Woolie can do it
[0:47:05] <mudapersona> online runs pretty good too
[0:47:05] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @MayorRev try out all weapons, you might find stuff you didn't think you'd like, pay attention to monster attack tells and uh...yeah, have fun
[0:47:10] <PanicSwytch> GaijinHunter real helped me understand previous MH games
[0:47:12] <+lcl_mayhem_lcl> Have you encountered any frame dips?
[0:47:13] <%Frost_Quill> One thing I didn't like in World was how there was no need to use all the traps in the arena.  They were just for cool moments.  This seems like a nice change.
[0:47:17] <OneThousandTomatoes> hunter notes are key, look at those, also feel free to look up guides.
[0:47:18] <aiutare47> Sweet my powers back on. Imma go make popcorn
[0:47:18] <%holydeviant1> I wonder if you get a shitload of mats from this
[0:47:23] <saiyanblitz> If it tower defense where are the monkeys
[0:47:28] <yourliteraldog> Is there magic in this world btw? From what I understand there monsters that don't have natural ecological niches and actively ruin others.
[0:47:37] <+GnarlyJarlie> @monkeyweed21 damn dude you killed him
[0:47:48] <skagtheprinceofhell> @Frost_Quill I mean, traps in the environment were free damage
[0:47:54] <$Dakuu75> a booby-bomb
[0:47:55] <Blank9> not quite magic but there is super biological steroid power
[0:47:58] <+MelodyMedley> Monster Hunter is a tower defence now?
[0:48:03] <%Nope80808> Whats your opinion on Utsushi. I already hate him more than Handler.
[0:48:04] <yourliteraldog> Pungi Trap?
[0:48:07] <OneThousandTomatoes> the best thing for a newbie to have it a friend wholl play with them and explain some of the less intuitive stuff
[0:48:10] <%JoshManVGH> @patstaresat the yellow icon in Materials seems to mean there's more information about that drop than there are columns on the screen.
[0:48:11] <aiutare47> @yourliteraldog I think there’s handwavy video game magic-not-magic
[0:48:13] <sonofthedeepsouth> guerrilla shit
[0:48:17] <%Frost_Quill> @skagtheprinceofhell No I mean man-made traps like these.
[0:48:19] <Zombrocom> @yourliteraldog Sorta? It doesn't really have magic but some monsters have powers that cant be explained, like kirin calling down lightning from the sky
[0:48:24] <+Pequod1> it's like the natural progression of the Huge Boss mechanics
[0:48:24] <skagtheprinceofhell> They put a bunch of gun powder in bamboo shoots and just lit that fucker up. Like fireworks
[0:48:39] <$Dakuu75> really? -because the idea of monsters forming a coordinated group-attack seems weird to me.
[0:48:42] <+Double_Tap_That> I'm very glad they brought back the more outlandish weapon designs compared to World's basic ones.
[0:48:45] <%sahykikserpent14> sahykikserpent14 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months! im fighting Zurvan with my bro to get the mount and on our last attempt I accidentally scrolled my hotbar and was stuck spamming aoe with DRK to finish half the fight, it turned out that run finally gave us the mount and the pala weps that I wanted.
[0:48:46] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @yourliteraldog there isn't magic, most of the non-realistic stuff is ascribed to mysterious natural energy, but actual magic is not a thing
[0:48:48] <%Monkeyweed21> they experimented with this in World and Iceborne
[0:48:58] <PanicSwytch> Is it true that stats get a buff on these missions?
[0:48:59] <skagtheprinceofhell> @Frost_Quill I just used them to trap the monster and then get more materials. I always used traps to catch the monsters
[0:49:01] <+D00msDayDan> C'MON
[0:49:02] <%patriotrenegade> ur dude looks like a nerd
[0:49:07] <+GnarlyJarlie> this mode is called Rampage? sort of seems like the opposite of a rampage lol
[0:49:14] <+Pequod1> OOOOOH
[0:49:15] <%Monkeyweed21> @Double_Tap_That World literally had 1 dude making the new weapon models
[0:49:17] <yourliteraldog> Got it totally not magic magic
[0:49:18] <SaltyAzteca> Oh shit, remember when we used to need to FIND ammo for that piece of shit Ballista!
[0:49:19] <+Pequod1> THEY LEARNED
[0:49:22] <OneThousandTomatoes> thats nice
[0:49:22] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> only took 40 years
[0:49:24] <DestroPrime83> big nut Kreygasm
[0:49:26] <Blank9> dragon's dogma style
[0:49:28] <+Flightedwings> Woaaaahhhh
[0:49:29] <SaltyAzteca> THE TIMES, THEY ARE A CHANGIN
[0:49:29] <skagtheprinceofhell> Or do you mean ballista? You only ever use those for siege quest which they were mandatory to use
[0:49:37] <+fockniapo> the amount of QoL is out of this world
[0:49:39] <+MelodyMedley> That's nice
[0:49:41] <%baka_sugoi> headshots
[0:49:43] <+fockniapo> try joining an online lobby
[0:49:46] <+fockniapo> takes seconds
[0:49:47] <+GnarlyJarlie> Craig
[0:49:52] <skagtheprinceofhell> Well besides Zora Magdaross which was just a "Just do it up to this point" fight
[0:49:57] <PerfectPepperPlantPro> Please shut up not-Strider
[0:50:03] <%Monkeyweed21> OOH
[0:50:04] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> This seems like a lot of fun in co-op.
[0:50:05] <%Frost_Quill> @skagtheprinceofhell No I mean the big man-made traps in the arenas.  Like the big drill spear.
[0:50:06] <$Dakuu75> I think I ONLY ever used the sonic bombs against Diablos in MHW. I never knew if they did anything for anything else
[0:50:14] <%Sora20030c> Sora20030c subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 30 months! 
[0:50:16] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @yourliteraldog it's like "oh this dragon has a mysterious organ which it uses to fly, must be a pretty old dragon" that sort of thing
[0:50:35] <skagtheprinceofhell> @Frost_Quill ...Again, free damage. You don't need to use them but it's free big damage
[0:50:38] <$Monkeyweed21> @Dakuu75 there are other monsters with sensitive ears like Khezu
[0:50:51] <+fockniapo> they have balanced everything to a t
[0:51:02] <yourliteraldog> TURRET SEQUENCE
[0:51:10] <$RealThiele> pile up the bodies
[0:51:12] <OneThousandTomatoes> most tunneling monsters have sensetive ears
[0:51:21] <%Frost_Quill> @skagtheprinceofhell Exactly, that's what I'm saying.  There was no need to use them but here they seem needed.
[0:51:38] <+MelodyMedley> Cannon!
[0:51:42] <Qsmash_> this seems cool
[0:51:43] <Saltmeisterr> CatJAM
[0:51:55] <skagtheprinceofhell> ...Of course, they have a bunch of monsters attacking and your literally defending a point like the Zora fight... how was that not clear?
[0:51:59] <Blank9> oh my god you can finally aim cannons
[0:52:10] <skagtheprinceofhell> This isn't the arena fight this is a tower defense sequence
[0:52:31] <%Xevtes> the cannon doesnt do more damage?
[0:52:34] <$RealThiele> earn $ to upgrade towers
[0:52:48] <OneThousandTomatoes> thats a big isuchi
[0:53:00] <%Xevtes> ah theres an aoe for it though
[0:53:07] <OneThousandTomatoes> are rampage mons hogher chance of gold crown?
[0:53:16] <rufus2k2> i thought the frog was elmo NotLikeThis
[0:53:17] <skagtheprinceofhell> Yes
[0:53:22] <%Deft_Thought> That and it doesn't seem to need to hit a weakpoint @Xevtes
[0:53:24] <+Goblinz_3> WHERE'S MY DRAGONATOR
[0:53:30] <OneThousandTomatoes> WHERES MY
[0:53:33] <%valriot> Dragonbate? 👀

[0:53:35] <$RealThiele> Bad Dragonator
[0:53:38] <+BradshawMcCaw> dragonbator
[0:53:47] <+MelodyMedley> Ah, there's an auto cannon too
[0:53:49] <%Xevtes> @Deft_Thought fair trade
[0:53:57] <skyentombment> Dragonator? More like Baconator hurhuhruhruhur
[0:54:03] <+Goblinz_3> Much longer
[0:54:10] <DestroPrime83> Anyone trying some new weapons this game? Im going gunlance instead of GS
[0:54:24] <aiutare47> MUCH longer
[0:54:32] <+HibikiYamada> man, this game's soundtrack is great.
[0:54:34] <OneThousandTomatoes> now charge
[0:54:39] <skagtheprinceofhell> I mean, it probably is longer
[0:54:47] <%patriotrenegade> SHOW ME YA MOVES
[0:54:51] <+Edrem> this already 10x better then zorah magdaros sections
[0:54:52] <OneThousandTomatoes> attack directly he says
[0:54:52] <+MelodyMedley> This game's just filled with stuff isn't it?
[0:55:03] <%VHGS> THICC
[0:55:05] <ItsJustShawn> big number
[0:55:08] <%Deft_Thought> @DestroPrime83 I'm excited to mess with the new Hunting Horn but I'm an SnS and CB guy.
[0:55:12] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> world eater arzuros LUL
[0:55:21] <skagtheprinceofhell> Man, it's nice to not be the only guys fighting these giant invasion fights.
[0:55:25] <%YakumoYomi> That damage
[0:55:28] <yourliteraldog> Pangolin Badger it has super corona
[0:55:30] <$Dakuu75> @PatStaresAt I think there's more empty weapons spots around the area
[0:55:35] <%Sora20030c> I want to buy this but I heard PC release is confirmed so I don't want to double dip
[0:56:02] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> With Great Sword, can you roll off a ledge and use your sword attack to "hop" back onto the ledge?
[0:56:03] <yourliteraldog> Gnarly brah
[0:56:07] <+Kavtech> @Sora20030c For next year, if that makes a difference.
[0:56:12] <+MelodyMedley> Gnarly
[0:56:25] <skagtheprinceofhell> @Spudnacious_Dynasty No, that's insect glaive.
[0:56:48] <$RealThiele> strikers
[0:56:51] <+TheIntellectional> ALL THE WARRIORS
[0:56:55] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> @skagtheprinceofhell Hammer, GS, and GL could do it in World. Probably others.
[0:57:08] <%BestTeaMaker> FUGEN THE ELDER
[0:57:11] <$floralkami> chat, is that a switch axe or a regular great sword?
[0:57:16] <SaltyAzteca> ahaaaa Kappa
[0:57:16] <$Dakuu75> lol
[0:57:18] <%valriot> LUL
[0:57:19] <+texflexrex> Does this game have too many mechanics?
[0:57:26] <yourliteraldog> Taste his long sword pat
[0:57:27] <+MelodyMedley> My LONGsword
[0:57:30] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> I'd love to know if it stuck around from World to Rise.
[0:57:31] <$Dakuu75> this guy is all YOLO
[0:57:41] <+TheIntellectional> gachiBASS
[0:57:51] <+Kavtech> @texflexrex Not if you've played the previous games. Or if you just take it slow.
[0:57:58] <skagtheprinceofhell> What when? Never could do that with my Great Sword or do you mean keep charging back onto the platue?
[0:58:15] <$floralkami> ... chat, anyone knows if thats a greatsword or a switch axe?
[0:58:18] <skagtheprinceofhell> When you say hop I thought you mean use the GS as the part to jump off from
[0:58:24] <DestroPrime83> damn
[0:58:32] <Zombrocom> Fugen got em
[0:58:35] <%Deft_Thought> He's gone now
[0:58:37] <skagtheprinceofhell> Great Sword
[0:58:40] <+MelodyMedley> Fugen strong
[0:58:40] <ilpeggiore_> are you liking this mode pat?
[0:58:40] <$floralkami> i can't tell by that slight charging animation i think i see
[0:58:40] <%Deft_Thought> Seems like a one and done
[0:58:48] <ergulor> but you have to aim it
[0:59:04] <PleaseCallMeSugar> this mode looks like so much fun
[0:59:13] <Saltmeisterr> U sent its lline of sight then it goes
[0:59:14] <+MelodyMedley> Hell yeah
[0:59:14] <%Mr_Pylon> Arkham move right here
[0:59:18] <$floralkami> okay, i'm guessing that charge move is a new move
[0:59:29] <%ChrisPlaysThing> So, i'm gonna say it; this looks way less fun than World
[0:59:43] <PleaseCallMeSugar> really awkward how the monsters just fade out lmao
[0:59:46] <skagtheprinceofhell> ...How do you see this and think less fun?
[0:59:59] <yourliteraldog> Nothing beats Ironbull's explanation of the battle cry he let's out after you kill a dragon with him in Dragon Age. "It means I will derive sexual gratification from kill you"

[1:05:14] <SaltyAzteca> One plan at a time Pat
[1:05:15] <Itachi795> who's that pokemon???
[1:05:16] <AllenDeadman> no they were just some farming village back then
[1:05:16] <kamenspidey> just unskilled ones
[1:05:18] <%Mr_Pylon> maybe they had scrub hunters
[1:05:19] <%Vyskus> Is this doing the weird FFX thing where instead of new lipsyncing they just weirdly stilt all the dialogue
[1:05:19] <sonofthedeepsouth> Noo they dint have shit
[1:05:21] <%whyskeywolfe> No last time we just threw wave after wave of children at them
[1:05:22] <bigshedman> First hour of the game: Destroy Ganon
[1:05:23] <skagtheprinceofhell> I mean you saw the wallpaper. They looked like farmers fight off this stuff
[1:05:24] <%UvBenServed> "As opposed to all those shit hunters walking around"
[1:05:25] <%ChrisPlaysThing> @skagtheprinceofhell Granted i've tuned in like 1 hour late and know nothing about Rise at all so
[1:05:25] <marvel877> Magnamalo, the evolved form of that kid from Twilight Princess. "PAY ME"
[1:05:25] <PleaseCallMeSugar> it's so awkward how the VA put in way more emotion than the animators did
[1:05:28] <Slam_Punk> Kappa
[1:05:28] <%toastybites> bro what the fuck was the elder doing
[1:05:29] <%Deft_Thought> So its literally just another Nergigante
[1:05:29] <Mirrorcatch> all those guys who died? they sucked
[1:05:30] <ScreamLord> Poorly
[1:05:30] <karovus> shut up dont think about it
[1:05:30] <gronzen> Hiding.
[1:05:30] <sonofthedeepsouth> Riders?
[1:05:31] <Slam_Punk> They manage?
[1:05:31] <%Monkeyweed21> Living in a monhun village sucks ass
[1:05:34] <%solracc25> Cocobo man!
[1:05:34] <+Double_Tap_That> With great difficulty
[1:05:35] <yourliteraldog> Those child soliders look pretty competent
[1:05:36] <PanicSwytch> Why do u rely so much on ONE hunter
[1:05:37] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> maybe they only have low rank hunters
[1:05:38] <%Ynkubus_> How many MH games have the guild just drop some nooby hunter into the laps of villages?
[1:05:38] <%hrbeck_> this is a village of CASUAL GAMERS
[1:05:39] <+cade_calrayn> THEY ARE CHILDREN
[1:05:40] <+megaman_sentinel> why are these kids carrying giant weapons
[1:05:42] <+jofrankii> it's a isolated island just like JAPAN
[1:05:42] <Blank9> surely they had a plucky cadet that sucked ass
[1:05:43] <%Monkeyweed21> Moga Village went like 30 years without a hunter @PatStaresAt
[1:05:44] <+MelodyMedley> Not well?
[1:05:44] <$floralkami> isn't this some prequel?
[1:05:48] <skagtheprinceofhell> I mean they got weapons, they can fight
[1:05:52] <AllenDeadman> those kids want to die or something
[1:05:54] <$RealThiele> child soldiers
[1:05:56] <Slam_Punk> America please
[1:05:56] <slimslimjim88> Gatherers?
[1:05:58] <skagtheprinceofhell> WE GAVE HER A GUN FOR FUCKS SAKE!
[1:05:58] <marvel877> That kid would be better help if they moved the hair out of their eye...
[1:05:59] <sonofthedeepsouth> Fucking?
[1:06:00] <%solracc25> ONE chocobo hunter with a cat and a dog
[1:06:01] <$floralkami> i hate these children already
[1:06:03] <%toastybites> GO BACK INTO THE KITCHEN LITTLE GIRL
[1:06:07] <%GarbageNirvana> Pretty revolutionary of this game not to have lip syncing for any language it's in
[1:06:07] <fusedforms> it's a Kamura Village tradition to use children as meat shields
[1:06:08] <%hrbeck_> incest?
[1:06:09] <Blank9> Moga village had badass fishermen though
[1:06:10] <%blaggablag> The two of you should GO BE USELESS OVER THERE
[1:06:11] <cacophanes> How does the combat feel compared to World?
[1:06:11] <%czeekytv> 10 years old is old enough for Japan
[1:06:13] <AllenDeadman> they got LUCKY
[1:06:18] <Frostydough1> @PatStaresAt playing from the beginning can confirm that the blacksmith says something along the lines of "we finally have a hunter"
[1:06:18] <%solracc25> DANGO
[1:06:20] <hakumaribo> how far into the game is this?
[1:06:24] <AllenDeadman> @czeekytv don't
[1:06:25] <%Monkeyweed21> Living in a remote MonHun village SUCKS
[1:06:26] <yourliteraldog> Yeah make me some dinner little girl
[1:06:27] <%rumtumtugnutz> those kids have potato faces
[1:06:28] <%GarbageNirvana> Ten years old is, like, prime protagonist material in Japan
[1:06:35] <gronzen> God I wish I wasn't fucking poor and could a switch... and this
[1:06:39] <Slam_Punk> Alright if I say puritan one more time it might not be a warning, peace boys!

[1:07:05] <%BoxNavy> remember augmenting from world?
[1:07:12] <%Frost_Quill> To be fair in Pokemon they send their 10 year olds to go out and throw balls in giant monster's faces.
[1:07:13] <%rumtumtugnutz> You gotta intensify.
[1:07:15] <%Monkeyweed21> you gotta crank that 90
[1:07:16] <slimslimjim88> Tap to add one colourless mana

[1:22:59] <$RealThiele> inflicts a status ailment for the objectives too
[1:23:23] <%YakumoYomi> Counter Signal boosts your hunter's damage big time

[1:33:40] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> pat carted in low rank, not a true gamer confirmed
[1:33:41] <mike2hands> Just like real life
[1:33:43] <%Frost_Quill> Fainted against low rank Barroth.  psaWhat
[1:33:45] <lets_be_friendos> hammer is the most fun to use imo, the wirebug moves are so cool
[1:33:47] <slimslimjim88> What happened? Was reading chat brettu1
[1:33:48] <+wizard_of_diamonds> They watched your bulls get crushed
[1:33:52] <$Afterman_> wait is this bitch the desert from tri
[1:33:54] <rcand9> is sick
[1:33:57] <DestroPrime83> is it B to jump mid air?

[1:34:03] <OneThousandTomatoes> its ok oat its your first time fighting it Kappa
[1:34:05] <%Livelinne> How’s the chonky Gief? psaDogchamp
[1:34:06] <+mitzieter> the wirebug system is so much better than  mhw system
[1:34:06] <rcand9> traversal is insane
[1:34:07] <%NopeBadguy> Does anyone know if Woolie is trying this game?
[1:34:08] <DestroPrime83> cool
[1:34:10] <+jofrankii> yeah the hammer is insane, especially the first switch skill
[1:34:12] <$RealThiele> wirebug turns this into dmc
[1:34:14] <sonofthedeepsouth> IGNORED
[1:34:16] <millionstabz> @DestroPrime83 A
[1:34:17] <ScreamLord> It's the SLinger but better in every way
[1:34:19] <rcand9> its like youre spiderman
[1:34:19] <slimslimjim88> OMEGALUL first time
[1:34:19] <%YakumoYomi> Wait until you get the Rocket Dash for Gunlance
[1:34:41] <hakumaribo> no health or stamina lost on cart?
[1:34:41] <Sol_Install> I still want underwater back knowing they know how to allow movement via wire bugs
[1:34:44] <DrStinkers> Ultra Instinct Barroth
[1:34:49] <dexdestroyazz> maana, Parasol-pupper is fuckin rad
[1:34:51] <+Double_Tap_That> The GS struggle
[1:34:51] <halfmasks> dont you have to be blue sharpness to not bounce off barroth's head
[1:34:56] <slimslimjim88> WHY-ARE bugs?
[1:34:56] <%valriot> CHOOOOO
[1:34:59] <VexedSteve> psaDogchamp
[1:35:04] <%Monkeyweed21> @ScreamLord its nothing like the slinger its a better clutch claw
[1:35:05] <%Frost_Quill> Oh yeah wait you didn't lose your health and stamina buffs?
[1:35:12] <OneThousandTomatoes> come on pat
[1:35:23] <yourliteraldog> hehe he steam
[1:35:28] <%YakumoYomi> @Sol_Install Agreed. I'm sure they could figure out a way to make underwater better if they can come up with the Wirebug
[1:35:28] <rcand9> imagine underwater battles with rises control it would actually be fun
[1:35:33] <%hrbeck_> The year 2030: Civilization is in ruins. Capcom laid to waste. Woolie says to the podcast "yeah, so I'm trying Monster Hunter Rise" Pat is a skeleton. He is perturbed.
[1:35:35] <$Afterman_> tail thwip
[1:35:35] <+Jolnir> TPFufun
[1:35:36] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Damn that instant charge from Barroth
[1:35:37] <%NopeBadguy> shoulda tackled that
[1:35:40] <ScreamLord> @Monkeyweed21 I meant the Clutchclaw
[1:35:44] <AllenDeadman> YEYEYEE THE TAIL
[1:35:45] <PerfectPepperPlantPro> Is barroth making choo-choo noices new?
[1:35:46] <cacophanes> haha barroth go pheeeew
[1:36:03] <+thelonechris> Is Pat winning?
[1:36:06] <DestroPrime83> he hauling ass outta there
[1:36:07] <+youjellyman2> the mobility in this is insane
[1:36:09] <TheAlmostBlind> which system is this on?
[1:36:17] <$Afterman_> @PatStaresAt how do you feel about each map being one large area w/o loading screens?
[1:36:18] <halfmasks> BARROTH! YOU CANT ESCAPE ME!
[1:36:20] <OneThousandTomatoes> @destroprime83 no gloryKeK
[1:36:21] <%YakumoYomi> TINK
[1:36:22] <%Ascethetic> Switch
[1:36:23] <Sol_Install> @YakumoYomi Yep
[1:36:27] <rcand9> the action is fucking seemless with all these movement actions holy shit
[1:36:27] <%Monkeyweed21> @ScreamLord I really hope the next MH game keeps both the slinger and wirebugs, but that might be too much
[1:36:44] <PerfectPepperPlantPro> Choo-Choo
[1:36:50] <Targical> Is slinger ammo still a thing? Or do you toss pebbles again lol
[1:36:51] <+Deosier> ran all this way just to tackle chicken
[1:36:53] <$RealThiele> kaiju time
[1:37:00] <%solracc25> CHOCOBO!
[1:37:04] <luciluxlu0> bird up
[1:37:05] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Aw sik
[1:37:08] <cacophanes> Yolk that mud train, Pat
[1:37:17] <+Kavtech> @Monkeyweed21 What's the point of the Slinger now that you can freely aim thrown items like the infinite kunai?
[1:37:22] <%YakumoYomi> Barroth must have sense Kulu sharpening his weapon from across the map
[1:37:25] <ScreamLord> That's a big Kulu
[1:37:26] <slimslimjim88> Is this new sonic game better or worse than the older games? brettuDerp brettuLUL
[1:37:37] <Rotwik> Good old Capcom. Just released and there's already a DLC pack of customization stuff.
[1:37:40] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Kulu ain't even mad about it. He kicks Barroth while he's down then fucks off LUL
[1:37:41] <+thelonechris> Your character sounds fucking pissed
[1:37:42] <fusedforms> did the monster just deploy fart gas
[1:37:49] <DestroPrime83> the fact your character is no longer a freak mute is great
[1:37:50] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @Monkeyweed21 this doesn't have a slinger, only wirebugs, but the next mh will probably have some form of movement like this since the devs seem to like having it in
[1:37:56] <lets_be_friendos> my favourite new monster to fight are the sumo platypus and the fruit throwing monkey
[1:37:58] <yourliteraldog> ride the boy
[1:38:04] <%dkzk21> not a fan of the mid-fight dialogue.
[1:38:09] <$RealThiele> fuck yo face
[1:38:18] <%primarch_lupercal> this is some good riding music
[1:38:22] <Saltmeisterr> this is a bop
[1:38:24] <%dkzk21> im assuming you can choose grunts instead in the charactee creator?
[1:38:27] <+Kavtech> @DestroPrime83 Actually, they still just grunt in cutscenes, and it's really weird.
[1:38:28] <Saltmeisterr> CatJAM
[1:38:35] <halfmasks> @dkzk21 You can turn it down in the options, even change it to fake language
[1:38:41] <glgzephyr> I was just noticing how awesome this track is
[1:38:42] <%Monkeyweed21> @Kavtech moves like the Dual blades dodge shot, the greatsword shot interrupt, and things like Kinsect feeding and the wyrmstake mine need the slinger
[1:38:43] <OneThousandTomatoes> @dkzk21 yeah
[1:38:43] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Nice hit
[1:38:44] <AllenDeadman> I like the music in this game, better than world's
[1:38:48] <millionstabz> I hope they bring back Proof of a Hero as BGM for the hub or something
[1:38:50] <glgzephyr> it's on par with the better MHW battle music
[1:39:01] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Nice desu ne
[1:39:01] <AllenDeadman> nice
[1:39:02] <%psidefx> Nice
[1:39:02] <%Treuan> Nailed it
[1:39:02] <rcand9> ice

[1:39:04] <halfmasks> DINK
[1:39:04] <OneThousandTomatoes> cool
[1:39:05] <bigshedman> World had some amazing tracks tho
[1:39:06] <PerfectPepperPlantPro> NICE!
[1:39:08] <%dkzk21> music is good though.
[1:39:09] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @dkzk21 you can choose what language the quips are in and how often they appear, you can also turn them off
[1:39:09] <lets_be_friendos> has pat tried hammer?
[1:39:11] <Saltmeisterr> COOL
[1:39:11] <%primarch_lupercal> STYLE
[1:39:11] <%dkzk21> as always.
[1:39:13] <+Kavtech> @dkzk21 No but you can change the frequency of voice lines in 20% increments, down to 0% if you want.
[1:39:14] <glgzephyr> Nothing personnel, kid
[1:39:14] <MonstarGrrrl> 0 carts Kappa

[1:39:39] <sonofthedeepsouth> hmm monster meat
[1:39:43] <%Livelinne> psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp
[1:39:55] <OneThousandTomatoes> sounds like the perfect opportunity for a dog cam
[1:39:57] <glgzephyr> I wish you could change the frequency of each individual bark
[1:39:58] <%baka_sugoi> you sikpped on back there
[1:40:11] <%coward_man> Holy shit this game looks so gorgeous! just proving again that the re engine is made by wizards
[1:40:12] <Targical> I don’t remember, did barroth have a car able head in Tri?
[1:40:12] <cacophanes> love how the drop glow is less bright than it was in World
[1:40:19] <OneThousandTomatoes> ye
[1:40:20] <%YakumoYomi> @shotgang86 "It's comin' right for us!" =murders grazing Kelbi=
[1:40:27] <%baka_sugoi> psaDogchamp
[1:40:27] <dan_g_v> he knlws the den of degeneration is safe and warm while you play, Pat
[1:40:34] <rcand9> i thought going back to old mh after world was tough but going back to worlds gonna be near impossible
[1:40:36] <PerfectPepperPlantPro> PTSD of hoping I got some med monster bones from Barroth kicks in
[1:40:37] <+youjellyman2> i wonder how this game will look on PC
[1:40:45] <%Livelinne> Dogs nap and fool around when you doing stuff
[1:40:46] <DestroPrime83> im still trying to figure out when you can tell if its capturable or not
[1:40:55] <+Kavtech> @Targical I was playing it earlier this week, they did.
[1:40:59] <OneThousandTomatoes> goin back to world after rise will be rough
[1:41:00] <%astropupp> astropupp subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 23 months! 
[1:41:00] <%Livelinne> Especially when you doing stuff
[1:41:01] <AllenDeadman> looks like it
[1:41:07] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt it is
[1:41:12] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> Royal Ludroth is a good boy
[1:41:13] <+Kavtech> Don't worry, it is!
[1:41:14] <ScreamLord> Look at Barroth's gear dude
[1:41:15] <Zeif00> woolieGASM
[1:41:17] <OneThousandTomatoes> it is
[1:41:22] <$Afterman_> C/D this game is like a perfected tri with no swimming
[1:41:22] <%solracc25> dango
[1:41:25] <rosabellamelantha> Sandy Plains is also a remix of 3U's desert map @PatStaresAt
[1:41:26] <+theballad_tft> So you want just a forest?
[1:41:28] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Can Greatsword still spam ledge attacks?
[1:41:30] <glgzephyr> is that Voice 10
[1:41:31] <OneThousandTomatoes> i think you can climb the ziggurat
[1:41:34] <cacophanes> Yeyeyey get that Ludroth juice for maximum stamina
[1:41:36] <%dkzk21> oooo i like this town.
[1:41:38] <PerfectPepperPlantPro> 3 Flooded forest is amazing, favorite map
[1:41:45] <%dkzk21> and the song.
[1:41:47] <+thelonechris> Castle armor

[1:42:00] <$floralkami> eeeh, you had something
[1:42:14] <+JakeOfalco> how important are skills ?
[1:42:18] <+Double_Tap_That> So the guard skills apply to the tackle is what I'm understanding?
[1:42:20] <cacophanes> Straight up a railroad
[1:42:21] <OneThousandTomatoes> cool
[1:42:21] <glgzephyr> oh hey you can build it
[1:42:24] <bigshedman> Awh yeah, spicy rib-sword!
[1:42:26] <Manwad> That looks gorgeous
[1:42:29] <glgzephyr> Skills are highly important
[1:42:33] <rosabellamelantha> Rise's version of flooded forest is fucking amazing tbh, took one of my favourite maps and added its own spin
[1:42:36] <+Kavtech> Craft or upgrade eight weapons of the same type to get a new Switch Skill!
[1:42:40] <dimensaur> the McRib! amydroHYPE
[1:42:43] <%Ghufufin> ahh that traditional negative affinity
[1:42:45] <$Afterman_> that one turns the dog into the hnalder

[1:42:54] <%primarch_lupercal> commando dog
[1:42:59] <shotgang86> the palamut armor is so good holy shit
[1:43:03] <OneThousandTomatoes> @jakeofalco skills can really change bow you can play
[1:43:04] <glgzephyr> @Kavtech Motherfucker don't you motivate me to play every weapon, don't you do it
[1:43:07] <$Afterman_> ok but i dont want dogs gone either
[1:43:11] <%Monkeyweed21> whats the dog Kulu Ya Ku? @PatStaresAt
[1:43:12] <OneThousandTomatoes> how*
[1:43:13] <Sol_Install> They should bring back underwater due to wirebugs seriously
[1:43:15] <millionstabz> Where do you forge Buddy armor?
[1:43:17] <%Ghufufin> who doesnt like being spooderman?
[1:43:17] <cacophanes> So were the Oils for SnS but here we are
[1:43:22] <AllenDeadman> YEYEYEYEYE
[1:43:23] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> YOOOOOOOOOOO

[1:43:27] <IceXAura> Yeah
[1:43:29] <hakumaribo> thats just the flooded forest from 3 wtf!
[1:43:30] <%Treuan> Nostalgia
[1:43:30] <%PettyFunk> I worry that that was Crazy Talk
[1:43:33] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt Sandy plains was from 3 too, this game is MASSIVE MH3 nostalgia
[1:43:33] <rcand9> wirebugs seem like the best idea capcom has had in years
[1:43:34] <PerfectPepperPlantPro> HELL YE
[1:43:35] <%TIME_PUNCHER> yay Hunster Monter
[1:43:35] <OneThousandTomatoes> nostalgia chemicals
[1:43:35] <HeroToxiko> yeyeyeyeye i loved that forest marsh
[1:43:36] <Sol_Install> dogs, wirebugs
[1:43:38] <shotgang86> is mounting and riding as bad as it is the claw wall smash in world?
[1:43:40] <Sol_Install> These SHOULD stay
[1:43:41] <AllenDeadman> IT'S EXPANDED FROM THE ONE IN 3
[1:43:43] <Sol_Install> no questions
[1:43:46] <%YakumoYomi> Apparently, you can even enter the pyramid
[1:43:47] <%Monkeyweed21> THATS NEW
[1:43:49] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> I WANT AN ANCESTRAL STEPPE remix SO BAD
[1:43:51] <mikeygrd> right next to smithy to the left
[1:43:55] <slimslimjim88> I. AM. A. GENIUS -signed Port
[1:43:56] <%Deft_Thought> I really enjoyed the clutch claw changes in Iceborne
[1:43:57] <%HaloPlayerNamedJohn> If they ever introduce another Monster Hunter fighting game character itll have to have the wirebug
[1:44:03] <rcand9> i like these intros
[1:44:06] <OneThousandTomatoes> sponge
[1:44:09] <AllenDeadman> SPONGY FUCK
[1:44:10] <+n33t_1337> big sponge
[1:44:14] <%Treuan> Rudloth! Rudloth! Rudloth!
[1:44:14] <+Kavtech> Royal Ludroth looks spongier this time.
[1:44:15] <%Ghufufin> bannana snek
[1:44:18] <shotgang86> "Dude relax its just a Royal Ludroth"
[1:44:21] <%Frost_Quill> Alright you convinced me to buy this one.  I was prepared to skip it but this looks great.
[1:44:24] <%valriot> BANANA BOY
[1:44:25] <%GarbageNirvana> Amazing how the elimination of loading between zones and a new engine makes old maps feel new again
[1:44:25] <$Afterman_> man these intros give some characterization to the monsters, i like it
[1:44:28] <rcand9> sponge bob lizard pants
[1:44:28] <%Xevtes> spongy boy
[1:44:32] <DrStinkers> Omg i thought it said Meme Contenter
[1:44:32] <+darthvader438> Who the hell is the chiquita banana looking mofo?
[1:44:33] <OneThousandTomatoes> look at this anime protag with his harem
[1:44:33] <%blaggablag> I'm looking at a comparison vid for the sandy plains maps, they did something amazing
[1:44:33] <%YakumoYomi> RL doesn't appreciate you messing with is harem
[1:44:33] <%TIME_PUNCHER> MANE contender I get it
[1:44:36] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt the shortcut is still here btw
[1:44:36] <%hrbeck_> spongy boi
[1:44:39] <Mattais88> Oh thats where the banana hammer comes from
[1:44:40] <%Deft_Thought> "Mane Contender" cmonBruh
[1:44:45] <marvel877> Sponge monster?
[1:44:53] <dimensaur> Bananasilisk
[1:44:54] <AllenDeadman> it's the flooded forest, but because it doesn't have loading screens the can expand the fuck out of it
[1:44:56] <PerfectPepperPlantPro> I love wet tree place!
[1:44:56] <%hrbeck_> royal ludroth fucks HARD
[1:44:57] <AllenDeadman> it's the best
[1:45:06] <%Treuan> I miss my boy gobul
[1:45:07] <OneThousandTomatoes> DONT MENTION DURANBOROS
[1:45:10] <rosabellamelantha> it's moved up top insread
[1:45:22] <PerfectPepperPlantPro> DuranBroros!
[1:45:23] <mike2hands> Oh yeaaaaa my good this old maps looks so much better now
[1:45:26] <%Monkeyweed21> fuck Duramboros
[1:45:48] <OneThousandTomatoes> I timed out of duranboros so many fucking times
[1:45:48] <rosabellamelantha> yes
[1:45:49] <rosabellamelantha> there
[1:45:58] <Targical> Gotta use bugs maybe?
[1:46:06] <PerfectPepperPlantPro> Duran was a fun fight until you had to fight it a million times for its stupid tail parts
[1:46:12] <%hrbeck_> big bug time
[1:46:51] <A0N33> Aw hell yeah, I loved Flooded Forest back in Tri.
[1:46:56] <peyodogo> big bug time? D:
[1:47:00] <+JakeOfalco> this a 3 map ?
[1:47:02] <$KnightAsteran> oh, is this a remake of an old zone?
[1:47:04] <OneThousandTomatoes> but with new mobility that helicopter cammel might be ok
[1:47:05] <rosabellamelantha> the fact that they kept the shortcut showed to me this game fucking CARED
[1:47:20] <rcand9> these maps seem like sandboxes now with the tools at your disposal
[1:47:34] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> good memories of crimson qurupeco calling over jho in this map
[1:47:40] <+Kavtech> @JakeOfalco Well, kinda, remade from the ground up.
[1:47:43] <rosabellamelantha> The Pyramid was in duramboros's nest area
[1:47:46] <OneThousandTomatoes> pyramid was there
[1:47:47] <%YakumoYomi> You can go inside the pyramid apparently
[1:47:49] <rosabellamelantha> you just couldn't get near it
[1:47:54] <+Kavtech> The ziggurat was there, just in the background.
[1:47:54] <sonofthedeepsouth> Big Pyramid always there
[1:47:58] <%blaggablag> Big piramid was part of the skybox
[1:48:00] <rosabellamelantha> you can go inside it now
[1:48:09] <dan_g_v> background stuff you couldn't interact
[1:48:13] <%blaggablag> It looked very low res
[1:48:15] <PerfectPepperPlantPro> Fought lotsa green Narga's on this map too
[1:48:16] <+JakeOfalco> @Kavtech thats sick i have to go back and play it again :D
[1:48:20] <Profmcstevie> Oh hey Flooded Forest, AKA Lagiacrus Bowling Alley
[1:48:25] <%baka_sugoi> shiney
[1:48:29] <nukle0nik> man if anyone ever wondered what Monster Hunter would've looked like if it ever made it to the PS3 this game is it
[1:48:34] <rosabellamelantha> these smaller Pyramids were also there in the backgroiund
[1:48:40] <rosabellamelantha> this is SUPER faithful
[1:48:48] <OneThousandTomatoes> holy fuck
[1:48:50] <nukle0nik> it's really cool that they want to appeal to the handheld base but woof
[1:48:50] <$StrawberryPantsu> THATS A REMIX OF THE MUSIC TOO
[1:48:53] <+Kavtech> @JakeOfalco Same with the desert map, I only realized when I stumbled into the Jaggi nest.
[1:48:58] <%YakumoYomi> Decent remix of Trap in the Stream
[1:49:13] <PerfectPepperPlantPro> Weird sloppy skin guys
[1:49:16] <%Monkeyweed21> Imagine if they made Great Gobul good
[1:49:19] <sonofthedeepsouth> The chad Herbivores
[1:49:34] <sonofthedeepsouth> Care for my shitty opinions pat
[1:49:35] <mike2hands> Yeah gobul!! I try to remember his name
[1:49:37] <%blaggablag> Duramboros is rad
[1:49:38] <OneThousandTomatoes> hes cool but i hated fighting him
[1:49:39] <sonofthedeepsouth> Care for Em
[1:49:39] <dan_g_v> we need. the flying camel back
[1:49:41] <rosabellamelantha> Imagine if duramboros is in rise, firebirth or whatever
[1:49:47] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> flooded forest, but no gobul and lagiacrus BabyRage
[1:49:49] <OneThousandTomatoes> flash backs of pain
[1:49:53] <%baka_sugoi> thats a psaBig triangle
[1:49:55] <PanicSwytch> Duranboros was the giant ape?
[1:49:58] <nukle0nik> wow these stairs suck
[1:50:00] <AllenDeadman> YOU CNA CLIB THE PYRAMID
[1:50:00] <Profmcstevie> Ah my first Nargacuga fight in Flooded Forest, memories pieSmug
[1:50:04] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt bring bombs for the top of this temple
[1:50:04] <yourliteraldog> thats goofy
[1:50:06] <PerfectPepperPlantPro> Hitting Duram humps, very satisfying
[1:50:08] <%blaggablag> And then you went and try to hit it and he TAKES OFF LIKE A MAD LAD
[1:50:08] <Sol_Install> no
[1:50:11] <Sol_Install> it's fine
[1:50:12] <sonofthedeepsouth> Nah thats perfect
[1:50:13] <Sol_Install> goofy is fin
[1:50:13] <+mitzieter> not really supposed to go up there
[1:50:13] <%ssjklyco> Pat Stairs At
[1:50:14] <%YakumoYomi> Duramboros was the giant ox
[1:50:14] <Sol_Install> fine*
[1:50:15] <dan_g_v> better run over the side?
[1:50:20] <%chance_h> ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh
[1:50:21] <CharredChord> Getting those steps in Kappa
[1:50:22] <shotgang86> this is the best animation ever what do you mean
[1:50:25] <jumpyhugs> climb the slope beside the stairs
[1:50:25] <+JakeOfalco> thats a large amount of the map used up :p
[1:50:28] <%blaggablag> hippity hoppity
[1:50:29] <$floralkami> maybe, running up that side ledge instead?
[1:50:32] <%solracc25> nope
[1:50:36] <%solracc25> Intended
[1:50:37] <+wizard_of_diamonds> This is rad
[1:50:40] <OneThousandTomatoes> @panicswytch duranboros was a giant cammel that would spin around and throw itself at you
[1:50:44] <Targical> Is it faster just wire bugging?
[1:50:46] <$floralkami> jellied dog knees
[1:50:48] <+thelonechris> I'm amazed you didn't die from that fall
[1:50:49] <%chance_h> thoses stairs are for female PC models lol
[1:50:51] <lets_be_friendos> so jargras but no great jagras?
[1:50:57] <cacophanes> Wait how did that Bullfango fall asleep?
[1:50:58] <rosabellamelantha> wire bug is faster
[1:51:02] <rosabellamelantha> but more danger
[1:51:04] <rosabellamelantha> dangerous
[1:51:06] <mike2hands> They really based those pyramid to the ones in mexico painful stairs
[1:51:11] <dan_g_v> no shark frog either
[1:51:19] <+Kavtech> What's the red bar above the health bar?
[1:51:30] <mike2hands> Man, the sharkfrog
[1:51:34] <%Broand> oh this is the map from tri?
[1:51:35] <PanicSwytch> @onethousandtomatoes thanks
[1:51:35] <%LowSkillGod> LowSkillGod subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 14 months! LETS GO HUNT THE MONSTER
[1:51:36] <+MarlooRedd> but I like sharks and frogs FeelsBadMan
[1:51:36] <%Monkeyweed21> they removed the flooded caves and replaced it with the Ziggurat
[1:51:44] <rosabellamelantha> that's an endemic life you picked up that acts as armour
[1:51:49] <Profmcstevie> It looks like your buddies health
[1:51:53] <Oxybe> bonus hp
[1:51:56] <+mitzieter> has to do with great sword
[1:51:56] <PerfectPepperPlantPro> The way they did this map in portable 3rd was also kinda good I think, like "it's dried up now because of summer!"
[1:51:57] <nukle0nik> @mike2hands that you had to climb as a human sacrifice. and hope you didn't fall, because the obsidian blade of the executioner was a faster death than those stairs
[1:52:00] <OneThousandTomatoes> woah
[1:52:02] <$KnightAsteran> its reactive armour
[1:52:03] <%Monkeyweed21> Capacity on your Amazon poop bags
[1:52:03] <+MitchPfitz> piss meter
[1:52:08] <lets_be_friendos> this game runs surprisingly well in handheld
[1:52:13] <$KnightAsteran> it blows up when you get hit
[1:52:17] <+Kavtech> @Profmcstevie Buddy health is below sharpness.
[1:52:23] <slimslimjim88> Tells u how read u are brettu1
[1:52:25] <sonofthedeepsouth> Hit Sponge
[1:52:27] <halfmasks> hey spongebob
[1:52:29] <Profmcstevie> Ah I see
[1:52:29] <yourliteraldog> It looks like it made of scrotes
[1:52:31] <+JakeOfalco> shhchaw
[1:52:38] <sonofthedeepsouth> Hit big Banana
[1:52:38] <mike2hands> Fuck those stairs XD
[1:52:41] <%Monkeyweed21> This used to be all underwater
[1:52:54] <cacophanes> oh yea the dual blade juice daddy
[1:53:05] <OneThousandTomatoes> pat the wroggje
[1:53:08] <nukle0nik> how long has this game been out. pat's armor looks pretty dang crazy
[1:53:12] <+Kavtech> Looks less banana-like now, I think it does actually have a spongier texture.
[1:53:17] <slimslimjim88> So is this how we were able to make gmo bananas? Lul
[1:53:20] <halfmasks> missed the wroggi ride
[1:53:35] <%BoxNavy> (eagle noises)
[1:53:39] <nukle0nik> also wow my greatsword skill is awful compared to pat
[1:53:40] <%Ranryu692> @nukle0nik it came out today, but he got a review code yesterday. He streamed it
[1:53:48] <%Deft_Thought> I hope Kirin doesn't find its way into this game
[1:53:52] <%Deft_Thought> I hate that monster
[1:53:53] <ScreamLord> Guts?
[1:53:55] <%Monkeyweed21> Fortitude from meal
[1:53:56] <nukle0nik> @nukle0nik still seems heavy
[1:53:58] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> it's mane broke pretty quickly
[1:54:02] <$KnightAsteran> guts l?
[1:54:03] <PerfectPepperPlantPro> Kirin can go fuck itself
[1:54:07] <AllenDeadman> fortitude?
[1:54:08] <%GarbageNirvana> @Deft_Thought You know it will
[1:54:11] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt it's somewhat implied visually this is a few years after 3U as the tree in area 1 of sandy plains is much larger and most of the flooded forest is drained
[1:54:15] <%GarbageNirvana> I don't think there's been a MH game that hasn't had Kirin
[1:54:16] <slimslimjim88> It’s summoning it’s eagle powers!! brettuPog
[1:54:19] <sonofthedeepsouth> bitch ran
[1:54:20] <sirrice77> kirin is too popular and the armor too sexy
[1:54:20] <%Monkeyweed21> yea its Felyne Guts from the meal
[1:54:30] <IceXAura> I actually hope that we get Oroshi Kirin
[1:54:30] <rcand9> kirins not currently in the game? thank god!
[1:54:53] <OneThousandTomatoes> ice kirin coukd be cool
[1:55:00] <antimatter_man> I cant see them NOT putting kirin in
[1:55:06] <rosabellamelantha> Since 3U is my favourite I was super into all this shit
[1:55:15] <PanicSwytch> @deft_thought yeah but Id rather have kirin over rajang
[1:55:16] <%czeekytv> More fun than MH:W so far? @PatStaresAt
[1:55:16] <+wizard_of_diamonds> The yellow fleshy bits reminds me of a fruit or vegetable I've seen before
[1:55:18] <scarman125> is Lagiacrus not in this game either?
[1:55:24] <Mattais88> Anti-aired
[1:55:25] <PerfectPepperPlantPro> @GarbageNirvana 3U actually didnt
[1:55:26] <rosabellamelantha> sadly no
[1:55:36] <DazzlingFuhrer> elmo's doing his best pat
[1:55:43] <%twoto858> Lazy cat
[1:55:51] <ScreamLord> Maybe in an update?
[1:55:52] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> are you questioning the all-knowing Peepee?
[1:55:59] <shotgang86> Lets have sum...
[1:56:02] <OneThousandTomatoes> lagi eill probably be an update like how zig was
[1:56:08] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Wow, the Palico actually indicates if the mob is ready for capture. Coool
[1:56:19] <%Deft_Thought> @PanicSwytch Whaaat? Rajang is a cool fight though. Feels like an actual scrap.
[1:56:20] <jotabranded> kirin is a fan favorite now, i saw a recent poll they made in japan he was 5th
[1:56:32] <DazzlingFuhrer> FINALLY
[1:56:34] <AllenDeadman> YEEEE
[1:56:48] <lets_be_friendos> yeah well japan has bad taste in most things
[1:56:50] <scarman125> I'm tired of them leaving out Lagiacrus. that lame excuse they gave in MH:W was bullshit
[1:56:57] <+wizard_of_diamonds> gg
[1:56:59] <%KineticZen> Luddy buddy
[1:56:59] <halfmasks> nice!
[1:57:00] <%Frost_Quill> carve tail
[1:57:01] <AllenDeadman> ayyyy
[1:57:02] <%baka_sugoi> psaDab psaDab psaDab
[1:57:03] <PerfectPepperPlantPro> The reason Kirin is fan fave, especially in japan, probably has something to do with the female armor it gets you
[1:57:05] <shotgang86> carve the tail, THE TAIL
[1:57:07] <AllenDeadman> it's the best
[1:57:14] <%Monkeyweed21> TAIL

[1:57:20] <shotgang86> LUL
[1:57:21] <rosabellamelantha> I know it's somewhat rude to mention it but that whole leak revealed this games development might have been heavily impacted by covid which makes the somewhat weird roster cuts make sense
[1:57:21] <%twoto858> RIP
[1:57:21] <PerfectPepperPlantPro> Also the male armor really
[1:57:21] <%Deft_Thought> 20 seconds

[1:57:26] <OneThousandTomatoes> @scarman125 I dont think "the skeleton wont work" is a bad excuse
[1:57:26] <%asgard147> limesGiggle
[1:57:26] <+Angrec> F
[1:57:27] <Saltmeisterr> YEEEE
[1:57:27] <TheRealNumberJ42> F
[1:57:28] <MittensBroadcast> you captured it
[1:57:28] <dan_g_v> no tail for pat
[1:57:28] <%KineticZen> Same capture timer it's always been bucko
[1:57:29] <+RojanBo> pat taking so.little.damage in that fight
[1:57:30] <jotabranded> @PerfectPepperPlantPro you right
[1:57:30] <$RealThiele> slowpoke slow

[1:57:30] <Mister_McDerp> LUL get fucked
[1:57:33] <SaltyAzteca> No carves BibleThump
[1:57:33] <Chancebond> disgraceful
[1:57:36] <lets_be_friendos> the female armor is the only good thing about kirin
[1:57:36] <nukle0nik> what a bummer
[1:57:37] <alroy900> FFFFF
[1:57:39] <antimatter_man> Lmao
[1:57:42] <%Monkeyweed21> 20 seconds on a capture
[1:57:43] <IceXAura> Less time bcuz of capture lol
[1:57:44] <Zeif00> KEKW
[1:57:46] <%thbluewarden> do you get the tail anyway?
[1:57:46] <blackmageslowpoke> Slow as me!

[1:57:50] <A0N33> LUL
[1:57:51] <%Livelinne> psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead
[1:57:52] <rosabellamelantha> Also Lagiacrus's skeleton is IN THE GAME THO
[1:57:53] <%Frost_Quill> This is why I carve the tail as soon as it drops.
[1:57:55] <%czeekytv> Can you press + to skip that capture cutscene?
[1:57:58] <rosabellamelantha> his skeleton does work
[1:58:01] <ScreamLord> It's stupid that captures have shorter timers than kills
[1:58:04] <%KineticZen> Put that Ham in the microwave
[1:58:17] <OneThousandTomatoes> I'm talking about world
[1:58:30] <rosabellamelantha> ah mb
[1:58:32] <+jofrankii> love this monster
[1:58:33] <+seeb_c> agnaktor is coming back too @rosabellamelantha same with zamtrios
[1:58:35] <Saltmeisterr> yo the new monke boi
[1:58:36] <%Livelinne> Ham-on sandwich
[1:58:38] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> new monster pog
[1:58:44] <%czeekytv> Is that a McRib sword
[1:58:46] <nukle0nik> can't wait for the PC version of this game
[1:58:51] <%KineticZen> I can't fault World for introducing millions of people to the series but this outdoes it
[1:59:00] <%KineticZen> except for the voice acting that part sucks
[1:59:06] <scarman125> at least we're getting real weapon designs this time instead of shit duct tapped onto a default weapon.
[1:59:06] <$floralkami> pink usernames unite?
[1:59:10] <%Broand> Oh is that true?
[1:59:11] <$floralkami> yes, it worked
[1:59:11] <rosabellamelantha> ehhh, those two might come back in an exapsnion but I don't think they're title update tier monsters
[1:59:13] <OneThousandTomatoes> really?
[1:59:13] <%Treuan> Is THAT how it works
[1:59:15] <PerfectPepperPlantPro> Captures having shorter times makes sense since you dont gotta carve the whole thing and otherwise you'd just be dicking around doing nothing. Unless there's a tail to miss lol
[1:59:18] <+mitzieter> wait u get what?
[1:59:24] <Mattais88> Looks like a rack of ribs on your back
[1:59:31] <dan_g_v> voices are awsome in all options
[1:59:33] <ScreamLord> THAT is not a sword. That is a goddamn paddle
[1:59:35] <nukle0nik> that really does look like a mcrib
[1:59:38] <%Monkeyweed21> What does Dog get from Kulu Ya Ku @PatStaresAt
[1:59:39] <+theballad_tft> That GS looks stupid... I love it
[1:59:42] <%baka_sugoi> BBY back RIBS
[1:59:43] <aura_00> Pat's weapon looks like a gigantic rib steak
[1:59:46] <elicoy> Im hungry now...
[1:59:47] <nakpack> mcrib greatsword
[1:59:49] <rosabellamelantha> wait sorry you have to make what to unlock it?
[1:59:51] <%czeekytv> @PerfectPepperPlantPro You should just be able to choose when you leave, there's no reason not to
[1:59:53] <PerfectPepperPlantPro> What if GS but sparerib
[1:59:58] <alroy900> how is that a sword
[2:00:00] <%AzureGale> I love swinging giant logs as a weapon
[2:00:00] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> wroggi equipment is very yee haw, 10/10
[2:00:00] <demilauncher> how do you get new silkbind attacks?
[2:00:01] <%StaceMcGate> @PatStaresAt you think you'll do some multiplayer on stream?
[2:00:10] <alroy900> it has no edge
[2:00:11] <scarman125> it doesn't matter how many people World introduced the series to if they don't release the next game on any of the platforms that MH:W was on.
[2:00:20] <OneThousandTomatoes> In case some people missed it you can change out some of your moves for different moves
[2:00:21] <%Treuan> PAt is the best at gamblin
[2:00:22] <aura_00> alternatively it also looks like a bunch of Bongos
[2:00:25] <$floralkami> that's not a Greatsword, that's fucking ship panelling
[2:00:30] <%Broand> Bingo isn't the best outcome tho
[2:00:39] <%KineticZen> The Barroth rack of ribs or is that something different
[2:00:40] <elicoy> omg for a sec i thought the cats were playing "drop it like its hot" on the drums
[2:00:42] <%Monkeyweed21> dog armor? @PatStaresAt
[2:00:45] <PerfectPepperPlantPro> @czeekytv Probably a legacy thing at this point, dunno really why its the way it is beyond that indeed
[2:00:45] <nukle0nik> it's not even a sword, it's more like a big shitty ribwich club
[2:00:58] <rosabellamelantha> Rise isn't really intended for MHW fans though, it's meant for all the japanese players they lost with World which was way more western market focus
[2:01:12] <rosabellamelantha> the game is to get them back
[2:01:15] <$floralkami> i stg, if that sword has any sort of "sharpness," ima lose it
[2:01:15] <nukle0nik> acornpple
[2:01:23] <+projectmanatees> I wonder how the pc port of this will do
[2:01:25] <%Kay_Tana> Is tha rack of ribs?
[2:01:27] <%baka_sugoi> bob
[2:01:34] <%Foxsploder> @floralkami Gotta re-sauce it
[2:01:43] <dexdestroyazz> Thats no ship panelling, its the Anor Londo blacksmith's pan-pipe
[2:01:45] <%KineticZen> I can't wait a year for the PC port
[2:01:50] <%BoxNavy> his sns is cool
[2:01:51] <$floralkami> stop
[2:01:57] <nukle0nik> MHW was like the best selling Capcom game ever, i don't understand why they thin they need to regain some japanese PSP users
[2:02:00] <OneThousandTomatoes> were those cats just going super speed?
[2:02:02] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt does the dog also get a mustache from the Kulu armor?
[2:02:08] <%Broand> Wroggi's set looks so great
[2:02:10] <%BoxNavy> i meant his dual blades
[2:02:17] <$floralkami> fuck, it DOES look like a pan-flute
[2:02:18] <%BoxNavy> his dual blades are awesome
[2:02:19] <%NotVeryLegendary> NotVeryLegendary subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 46 months! Must resist urge to buy a switch for Rise....
[2:02:29] <%Livelinne> psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp
[2:02:35] <rosabellamelantha> @nukle0nik Monster Hunter is a japanese series marketed towards the japanese, world was the exception to this
[2:02:40] <dexdestroyazz> BIG ol' Poot-poots
[2:02:40] <rosabellamelantha> Japan is still the main market
[2:02:41] <%KineticZen> Velocidrome
[2:02:44] <AllenDeadman> look it's a bitch monster
[2:02:46] <Blank9> Wroggi has the coolest armor
[2:02:48] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> GREAT JAGGI IS THE BEST
[2:02:51] <%Treuan> Great Jaggi has been shafted
[2:02:53] <%Monkeyweed21> this is goofy considering what loser the Wroggi is
[2:02:53] <%BoxNavy> velocidrome is lame
[2:02:55] <Quivla> I love how with this game you can tell a person's skill at the game by how fast they move through the hub and menus
[2:03:04] <rosabellamelantha> they don't want to lose their loyal customer base of 15+ years
[2:03:07] <PerfectPepperPlantPro> They dont need to regain japanese psp users, they didnt leave. This game is to introduce all the new fans that came with the kinda more vanilla world to the crazy thats MH, now that theyre comfortable with the more basics of it.
[2:03:12] <nukle0nik> @rosabellamelantha the japanese video games market is fucking dead, trying to make a game only for the japanese audience is a horrible business decision at this point
[2:03:12] <%Monkeyweed21> great Macao is also a loser
[2:03:16] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> all the dromes are kinda eeeeeeeeeeeeeeh
[2:03:19] <cacophanes> that sharpness DansGame DansGame DansGame DansGame
[2:03:20] <Targical> I’m imagining a switch pro with the pc release of next year
[2:03:22] <$ff7regackted> Remember iodrome from 1?
[2:03:33] <rosabellamelantha> >Japanese videogame market is dead
[2:03:34] <rosabellamelantha> lmao
[2:03:35] <%BoxNavy> nah great maccao is interesting
[2:03:35] <AllenDeadman> @Monkeyweed21 great macao at least did SOMETHING
[2:03:36] <simplyvince15> Great Macao is ok
[2:03:38] <+theballad_tft> Did low rank SKYth longswords make a return in rise?
[2:03:45] <OneThousandTomatoes> I feel like the raptors fighting each other is just 'my dad can beat up your dad"
[2:03:46] <AllenDeadman> he wasn't great, but better than Jaggi and Velocidrome
[2:03:59] <nukle0nik> @rosabellamelantha the switch is barely selling, PS4 and PS5 aren't selling at all
[2:04:01] <scarman125> @nukle0nik because the Japanese are racists who who value a single Japanese consumer more than 20 foreign ones.
[2:04:02] <RamenRiderZ> Gendromes are actual bastards
[2:04:05] <%Monkeyweed21> the loser monsters added in World are WAY better
[2:04:21] <rosabellamelantha> >switch is barely selling
[2:04:26] <rosabellamelantha> what are you talking about?
[2:04:30] <%Treuan> Oh man
[2:04:31] <AllenDeadman> YEYEYEYE
[2:04:32] <samazam94> they should give the minion team up attacks that G.Izuchi got to all raptors
[2:04:37] <rosabellamelantha> the switch is one of nintendo's biggest successes ever
[2:04:41] <nukle0nik> @rosabellamelantha compared to how it used to be?
[2:04:41] <%baka_sugoi> less water
[2:04:42] <RamenRiderZ> The Tri areas looks great
[2:04:44] <simplyvince15> my favorite loser from world is kulu ya ku
[2:04:45] <PerfectPepperPlantPro> >Greentexting in twitch chat
[2:04:47] <AllenDeadman> shit changes throughout the years
[2:04:47] <%Treuan> I remember going through this area back and forth for... Machalite?
[2:04:51] <Pyroco101> oh wow that's a nice touch
[2:04:52] <samazam94> *G. Izuchi
[2:04:53] <OneThousandTomatoes> Not-Quite-As-Flooded Forest
[2:04:53] <%dkzk21> so pc version when?
[2:04:54] <%Monkeyweed21> the cave where you fought Ludroth also used to be flooded @PatStaresAt
[2:05:03] <SaltyAzteca> Where's Plesioth, said no one ever Kappa
[2:05:04] <+mitzieter> so was underwater in monster hunter bad or something
[2:05:04] <OneThousandTomatoes> @dkzk21 2022
[2:05:04] <%czeekytv> @rosabellamelantha MH4 sold as many units total in Japan as MHW did on the PS4 alone in Japan.
[2:05:08] <peyodogo> >
[2:05:15] <cacophanes> Great Maccao>>>>all other punching bag monsters
[2:05:27] <%BoxNavy> ITS SO BAD
[2:05:28] <Pyroco101> that feel when I actually like the swimming
[2:05:29] <%dkzk21> @onethousandtomatoes cool I can wait.
[2:05:29] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> I LIKED IT
[2:05:29] <Sol_Install> i like it
[2:05:30] <HeroToxiko> it as fucking awful
[2:05:32] <%Monkeyweed21> yep and there was a second cave
[2:05:33] <mike2hands> ye they basically use the same map just the top part
[2:05:34] <%Treuan> I kinda miss it, but I know it wasn't great
[2:05:34] <+mitzieter> lmao wow
[2:05:34] <%valriot> LUL LUL
[2:05:35] <%chance_h> i drowned
[2:05:36] <AllenDeadman> it was bad
[2:05:43] <Sol_Install> We have wire bugs now to help
[2:05:43] <DidacticTactic> i liked the underwater stuff
[2:05:43] <$Afterman_> they weren't that bad
[2:05:43] <RamenRiderZ> I remember digging up frogs and yanking Gobul from water
[2:05:44] <Targical> Is it the same for the forest map?
[2:05:44] <%Monkeyweed21> it was really clunky
[2:05:44] <%Deft_Thought> There were some cool looking underwater monsters though
[2:05:48] <IceXAura> They should give them another try
[2:05:49] <ScreamLord> I think they should try it again
[2:05:49] <simplyvince15> No, the best punching bag will always be Yian Kut-ku
[2:05:50] <HeroToxiko> we had to collect resources just to fight underwater and then extra ammo resources to atually do the fighting
[2:05:51] <mike2hands> i like them bt i can see why was such a hassle to continue
[2:05:54] <PerfectPepperPlantPro> I Actually didnt mind swimming. I knew it was bad but I could handle it
[2:05:55] <Sol_Install> There so many ways to improve it especially now
[2:05:56] <$Afterman_> I got into monhun cause of tri
[2:05:57] <Rogunz> It really depends on what weapon you mained, short weapons were awful.
[2:06:05] <%Ynkubus_> It'd be cool if they gave it another go with mounts and other gear
[2:06:06] <nukle0nik> hit them with your great club, remember to sharpen your great ribby club
[2:06:08] <Blank9> underwater was fun to me
[2:06:08] <HeroToxiko> just give us a free airlung or something
[2:06:11] <simplyvince15> I want Kut-ku back
[2:06:13] <$RealThiele> givin him the old ribwich
[2:06:14] <%HaloPlayerNamedJohn> Is there anyway to make good underwater combat in any genre of game
[2:06:19] <solracc25> Underwater gunlance was impossible
[2:06:24] <Sol_Install> It made water monster more unique
[2:06:24] <%Frost_Quill> Why does your character sound like a dudebro that got isekai'd into MH?
[2:06:28] <HeroToxiko> i mained switchaxe and bug glaive and it was a nightmare
[2:06:28] <TrickModeX> Hit em with the Ribs!
[2:06:32] <OneThousandTomatoes> I have fond memories of fighting lagi underwater with lagi gear
[2:06:41] <A0N33> I enjoyed the underwater but I used like Lance and Bowgun sooooo
[2:06:42] <samazam94> which is unfortunate since ceadeus is one of the coolest monster ever
[2:06:43] <MasterTonberry23> Pat why didnt you name your dog Baseball?
[2:06:44] <nukle0nik> give 'em the mudbutt
[2:06:58] <HeroToxiko> fighting lagi underwater was okay but i remember that boss fight
[2:07:03] <%solracc25> THE McRIB Sword
[2:07:04] <PerfectPepperPlantPro> I remember Lancing Abbyssal Lagia a shitton and managing pretty alright
[2:07:07] <nukle0nik> why does your dude keep yelling "BE CAREFUL!"
[2:07:08] <OneThousandTomatoes> @frost_quill because "he sounds like macho man" so pat chose him
[2:07:16] <Pyroco101> only the weak hate Tri's swimming
[2:07:23] <OneThousandTomatoes> Ceadeus was shit though
[2:07:36] <HeroToxiko> ^
[2:07:44] <MasterTonberry23> did pat fight khezu yet? not a spoiler, he was in the marketing
[2:07:50] <%KineticZen> Oh get fucked Wroggi
[2:07:55] <PerfectPepperPlantPro> GoldBeard Ceadeus so fun Kappa
[2:08:00] <nukle0nik> bap bap!
[2:08:08] <PanicSwytch> BIG NUMBERS
[2:08:10] <KasiCrafter> A get out of jail free card AND you pass Go for $200.
[2:08:11] <%Monkeyweed21> I miss Lagiacrus boiling the water around him when you fought him in 3
[2:08:13] <DrStinkers> sharpen that log
[2:08:13] <+Ragnakawaii> he really do be fighting with a rack of ribs
[2:08:15] <Blank9> You can sharpen while riding your dog
[2:08:39] <%BoxNavy> yes
[2:08:47] <elicoy> Pat is doing his job and influencing me to buy this
[2:08:49] <ullyzeez> awww pat's babies are in the game
[2:08:52] <PerfectPepperPlantPro> Wroggi a bitch
[2:08:54] <+Jolnir> TheTarFu
[2:09:00] <%BoxNavy> pat he wwas just standing there
[2:09:01] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Tricked again
[2:09:01] <IceXAura> Classic LUL
[2:09:04] <OneThousandTomatoes> zorah was the most interesting fight of the century compared to ceadeus
[2:09:04] <%solracc25> almost
[2:09:05] <TrickModeX> Hit his ribs with your ribs!
[2:09:07] <cacophanes> Jebaited Jebaited
[2:09:17] <$RealThiele> amazing
[2:09:19] <MasterTonberry23> i barely even notice this game is running on inferior hardware to the last game
[2:09:23] <%czeekytv> @OneThousandTomatoes zorah sucked ass so that makes me scared
[2:09:25] <%Monkeyweed21> Wroggi has chosen death
[2:09:26] <rcand9> worked out great
[2:09:34] <+Tucker0603> Pat's character sounds like he's trying to act like hulk hogan
[2:09:36] <ScreamLord> That GS looks like the rack of ribs from the Flintstones intro
[2:09:40] <darthmomin22> shouldn't be watching this I'm gonna spend 60 dollars a further expand my switch backlog again lol
[2:09:42] <MayorRev> Just to get a perspective here, how long to hunts usually last solo?
[2:09:49] <rosabellamelantha> that is wrong ceadeus was fun after the chase phase
[2:09:53] <%Monkeyweed21> @czeekytv Zorah is the least bad of all the big setpiece monsters
[2:09:53] <rosabellamelantha> super fun even
[2:09:58] <rcand9> EZ
[2:09:58] <AllenDeadman> Ez
[2:10:03] <rosabellamelantha> the MP version of him also cut out the chase
[2:10:07] <%Deft_Thought> When's Malfestio
[2:10:10] <OneThousandTomatoes> @czeekytv he wont be in this game
[2:10:15] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @MayorRev it's low rank so like 7-10 minutes
[2:10:15] <rosabellamelantha> the chase sequence was trash tho
[2:10:15] <%czeekytv> @Monkeyweed21 D: wow that's an awful track record
[2:10:19] <nakpack> that's like 10
[2:10:19] <nukle0nik> it times you out SO FAST
[2:10:20] <%Frost_Quill> Zorah literally just wanted to be alone.
[2:10:21] <%Monkeyweed21> @rosabellamelantha what you mean is Goldbeard is fun
[2:10:22] <AllenDeadman> damn
[2:10:23] <+wizard_of_diamonds> @MayorRev You didn't ask me, but the average MHW was around 15 minutes, give or take 5 minutes depending on your skill level
[2:10:27] <MasterTonberry23> did pat fight khezu yet
[2:10:28] <SaltyAzteca> 20 "schmeconds"
[2:10:33] <DrStinkers> 20 INcluding this cutscene Kappa
[2:10:44] <beautyfulman> @PatStaresAt Keep in mind, the first 10 are the cutscene of the monster falling asleep, its 20 if you skip that
[2:10:45] <nukle0nik> 20 Super Mario Bros on the NES seconds
[2:10:48] <tanarath> that's weak
[2:10:52] <scarman125> that voice does not belong on that anime ass child
[2:10:58] <+Double_Tap_That> @mastertonberry23 Yeah, but in a Rampage
[2:11:01] <%Monkeyweed21> @czeekytv special mention goes to Shah Dalamadur that has a 1 hit kill attack that hits the entire arena and can only be dodged with a perfectly timed dive
[2:11:07] <rosabellamelantha> @Monkeyweed21 I'm agreeing with you, I was disagreeing with the person that said Zorah was better
[2:11:11] <MasterTonberry23> @Double_Tap_That thank ye
[2:11:11] <dan_g_v> neat
[2:11:11] <nukle0nik> that looks awful
[2:11:12] <+Tucker0603> HAHAHAH

[2:11:15] <$RealThiele> oh noooo
[2:11:17] <lets_be_friendos> that's not badass DansGame

[2:20:02] <PerfectPepperPlantPro> New monsters seem to be winners once again
[2:20:02] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> boy low rank is very easy in this game
[2:20:02] <PleaseCallMeSugar> that's so not 20 seconds
[2:20:05] <%baka_sugoi> we a return too monkie
[2:20:06] <nukle0nik> 20 seconds as soon as you hit the monster
[2:20:07] <%Xevtes> @PatStaresAt do you expect Rise to do save transfers to PC when it comes out?
[2:20:07] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Pat you're not skipping the capture cutscene
[2:20:14] <SaltyAzteca> 20 seconds japan time Kappa
[2:20:14] <%ForlornCarton> Is it 20 seconds from when the music starts?
[2:20:17] <Qsmash_> does it speed up after you carve?
[2:20:20] <+Tucker0603> it's a bullshit 20
[2:20:23] <%BoxNavy> B
[2:20:24] <%Treuan> I think it's B
[2:20:24] <shotgang86> B
[2:20:25] <Zombrocom> 20 seconds from the very start of the capture
[2:20:25] <BlueSpartan119> B
[2:20:27] <%hrbeck_> look artmor
[2:20:27] <%rinnsi> press b
[2:20:29] <+Galaxyman64> is the 20 seconds going during the cutscene?
[2:20:34] <BlueSpartan119> it's like GU
[2:20:35] <sonofthedeepsouth> it was tho Kappa
[2:20:35] <%Frost_Quill> So I'm guessing he also has a sonic fruit thing, so he would do a "see no evil, speak no evil, hear no evil" thing.
[2:20:36] <rosabellamelantha> you have to spam B
[2:20:39] <$RealThiele> yea from the moment its drops timer starts its hit
[2:20:42] <PerfectPepperPlantPro> Have you tried hitting the skip cutscene button

[2:21:47] <$lumporr> who doesn't like bone cream
[2:21:47] <s1rcuit> Calcium gives you a defense buff
[2:21:48] <%MechArch> 'milk for a growing boy
[2:21:50] <%hrbeck_> milk tastes like broken promises, huh, pat?
[2:21:51] <cacophanes> Drink your milk like Homelander, Pat
[2:21:59] <AllenDeadman> ew
[2:21:59] <%primarch_lupercal> in One Piece milk literally gets luffy to regrow his teeth
[2:22:02] <shotgang86> the bones may be small, but the THICCNESS is what counts
[2:22:02] <%Frost_Quill> I'd drink it more if I wasn't limited to a few grocery trips a month.
[2:22:02] <Blank9> forced feeder fetish
[2:22:13] <sonofthedeepsouth> ot will wirk tho Kappa
[2:22:14] <leinadtonu> I like this music
[2:22:20] <Ravioli_Ronin> I used to love milk too, until I found out that there’s an acceptable amount of blood and puss for milk, and it isn’t 0%
[2:22:21] <%KineticZen> big sipp
[2:22:23] <nukle0nik> we can barely hear her
[2:22:26] <+fizzguy47> Geralt sells weapons now
[2:22:28] <%hrbeck_> Luffy regrows his teeth, the milk was a bonus
[2:22:34] <PleaseCallMeSugar> whole milk or no milk
[2:22:36] <%Frost_Quill> Is that the monkey weapon?
[2:22:37] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> YO the mushroom GS IS BACK

[2:22:56] <%Broand> It's vaguely like bishamonten
[2:22:59] <elicoy> @PatStaresAt What weapon movelist is the most different better or worse from MHW, if at all?
[2:22:59] <BoxNavy> yo pa check out wroggis dual blades theyre cool
[2:23:01] <$RealThiele> much milkies make mini man mollified
[2:23:07] <%rinnsi> there's an acceptable amount of many weird things allowed in food
[2:23:14] <PanicSwytch> Banana Boi
[2:23:16] <%Monkeyweed21> this is the SnS support armor
[2:23:24] <lemon_lover28> a lot of ugly armor in this game
[2:23:29] <Zombrocom> Tengu dog!
[2:23:30] <%Ranryu692> if it were a different color maybe it would be okay. but that yellow is hideous
[2:23:34] <PleaseCallMeSugar> MH Rise: "give your dog a batleth"
[2:23:36] <%hrbeck_> a tengu
[2:23:37] <shotgang86> I'm kinda curious if the feminine version still shows a boob window
[2:23:42] <A0N33> awww yee I LOVE that raincoat!
[2:23:42] <%Frost_Quill> The armor that looks lame on the hunter usually looks cute on the palico.
[2:23:50] <%Monkeyweed21> @Ranryu692 purple Ludroth is a thing
[2:23:52] <%primarch_lupercal> cant u recolour armour
[2:24:12] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @Ranryu692 there's a subspecies of ludroth that's purple-pink so there's a pink version too
[2:24:16] <%KineticZen> Pookie is back!
[2:24:17] <%BoxNavy> b a s a r i o s moon2W
[2:24:17] <OneThousandTomatoes> volvidon
[2:24:19] <nukle0nik> "the best quest"
[2:24:19] <PleaseCallMeSugar> pukei!
[2:24:20] <shotgang86> TOBI! *italian hand*
[2:24:20] <%baka_sugoi> PUKA PUKA
[2:24:20] <%Frost_Quill> Pukei-Pukei is 4 star?
[2:24:27] <OneThousandTomatoes> compelte the trinity
[2:24:35] <cardboardboots> pukie
[2:24:36] <shotgang86> oh fuck basarios is back?!
[2:24:41] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> at least it's not gravios
[2:24:42] <Zombrocom> Tobi and pukei being on barioth tier is wild
[2:24:48] <sonofthedeepsouth> Chadrioth POG
[2:24:55] <%BoxNavy> yo i just fought volvidon and hes cracked out now
[2:24:57] <cacophanes> Oh no he's a jiangshi
[2:25:01] <+Pyr0_Fr0st> Wait there are jagras but not Great Jagras? I'll miss my training dummy
[2:25:04] <%BoxNavy> thats not a wrong
[2:25:04] <HeroToxiko> huh
[2:25:05] <+Double_Tap_That> I actually didn't care much for Pukei when I initially played World, but the Witcher quest changed my mind.
[2:25:07] <$Afterman_> that's new
[2:25:10] <BlueSpartan119> getting to 4 star adds them
[2:25:11] <shotgang86> man basarios and gravios and the "final form" of that fucking sucks
[2:25:13] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> yeah they werent, huh
[2:25:14] <halfmasks> yeah thats new
[2:25:15] <%rinnsi> Man, game changing
[2:25:15] <Zombrocom> I do remember crafting them
[2:25:17] <BoxNavy> nevoh evoh
[2:25:19] <%Frost_Quill> Oh what that's cool.
[2:25:22] <shotgang86> I HATE that monster, its so boring to fight it
[2:25:22] <$Afterman_> definitely new
[2:25:24] <Zombrocom> and I wouldn't do that if I could buy em
[2:25:25] <%Monkeyweed21> Coral Pukei is WAY better
[2:25:26] <PanicSwytch> it was crafting only
[2:25:29] <LiulfrJ> used to be tranquilizer for sale but you'd still have to combine with bomb material
[2:25:30] <%Frost_Quill> Money well spent but that's weird.
[2:25:36] <PleaseCallMeSugar> it could be that the jagras face too much competition in the wild to become great jagras
[2:25:56] <Ravioli_Ronin> Buy milkers
[2:26:02] <Xenioplate> Is Pat playing Hunting Horn?!?
[2:26:04] <%BoxNavy> banane
[2:26:07] <Saltmeisterr> ok whats the difference between tranqing a mon and just killing it?
[2:26:08] <%baka_sugoi> psaDogchamp BO NA NA PLS
[2:26:15] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @Xenioplate gs
[2:26:18] <+Double_Tap_That> @xenioplate Nope, GS
[2:26:25] <%rinnsi> was gunna say, having a farm not making honey is criminasl
[2:26:27] <shotgang86> its so good to see that the handler is allllll the way in the new continent so we don't need to see that fucking face
[2:26:30] <nukle0nik> does pat keep cancelling out of the menu by hitting the wrong button? his using this interface is maddening :P
[2:26:36] <umbraawitch> shes cute
[2:26:36] <Xenioplate> Oh, that's a funky lookin' GS
[2:26:58] <%Frost_Quill> @Saltmeisterr More parts usually, plus unlocking arena fights in World, but I don't know if that's normal in the rest of the franchise.
[2:27:01] <Soulsbjorne> is that a rack of ribs on your back?
[2:27:05] <$RealThiele> Mc Ribsword
[2:27:08] <%Ranryu692> I forgot how good Dunkaroos are
[2:27:10] <WakeofRuin> dogy pls
[2:27:12] <silent__chief> Learning this new interface is killing me
[2:27:15] <Xenioplate> Is she the only European character?
[2:27:26] <%GarbageNirvana> Always ready for the barbecue
[2:27:39] <Saltmeisterr> @Frost_Quill so is tranq just better then?
[2:27:46] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Anyone know what controller Pat's using?
[2:27:47] <%rinnsi> Makes sense, since she's a traveler ladyu
[2:27:48] <%solracc25> Mc Rib hunter
[2:27:48] <%JoshManVGH> why. why were the weapons in world so lame
[2:27:54] <AllenDeadman> it's funny because she's a member of the Argosy and the trader back then used to be japanese
[2:27:55] <penitentpendant> Slather your weapon in Barbecue for extra flavor damage!
[2:27:57] <AllenDeadman> kmaThink
[2:27:58] <silent__chief> Covid man
[2:28:04] <PleaseCallMeSugar> low rank feels very... light
[2:28:07] <+Double_Tap_That> Maybe they backloaded it?
[2:28:09] <HeroToxiko> Free dlc Baybeeee
[2:28:10] <AllenDeadman> Oh god...
[2:28:18] <rosabellamelantha> Basarios is actually fun int his game
[2:28:20] <rosabellamelantha> for once
[2:28:26] <WakeofRuin> do you know what the lobster count is?
[2:28:30] <%Frost_Quill> @Saltmeisterr Usually but it takes a trap plus tranq bombs, and you have to do it when the monster is almost dead.
[2:28:35] <WakeofRuin> monster†
[2:28:40] <Ipsenscastle> the dough is so fucking weird
[2:29:00] <%YakumoYomi> Just bring an HBG to a Basarios/Gravios fight. People love seeing an HBG show up to a Gravios hunt.
[2:29:09] <$TheDrugWeCallWifi> This MH is so unabashedly Japanese, I love it
[2:29:10] <s1rcuit> the hub town is gorgeous
[2:29:10] <OneThousandTomatoes> @ipsenscastle you mean the mochi?
[2:29:14] <scarman125> I'm gonna miss the slinger.
[2:29:27] <%rinnsi> Im not
[2:29:30] <Ipsenscastle> @OneThousandTomatoes probably?
[2:29:37] <silent__chief> @PatStaresAt do you use a standard wireless Pro Controller?
[2:29:47] <Evendrag> god do these have popola and devola vibes...
[2:30:06] <OneThousandTomatoes> I think ill only miss the slinger a bit
[2:30:14] <silent__chief> I need to order one, playing handheld is rough
[2:30:21] <+ShutUpAceyP> how far is pat?
[2:30:25] <%Broand> wirebug armor
[2:30:26] <%rinnsi> the switch skill system in this game is magical
[2:30:26] <Rawbone_saw> big numba
[2:30:27] <+D00msDayDan> what are the odds of wyvern ignition coming back?
[2:30:30] <$RealThiele> wire dive feels better
[2:30:31] <OneThousandTomatoes> 4 star lr
[2:30:38] <AllenDeadman> HELL YEAH
[2:30:40] <%JoshManVGH> wow the shapening Dodongo is great
[2:30:45] <%JoshManVGH> One swipe
[2:30:45] <+rbakervv> @ShutUpAceyP just unlocked 4 star quests
[2:30:47] <OneThousandTomatoes> new move?
[2:30:51] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt no more mounting damage tho
[2:30:53] <%YakumoYomi> You say "Popola and Devola", but I see "Twin Fairies from Infant Island" (from the Mothra/Godzilla movies)
[2:31:03] <+ShutUpAceyP> ah so high rank
[2:31:05] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> nice for the gs to have a move for closing in
[2:31:07] <scarman125> this wirebug shit just screams anime bullshit an I'm not a huge fan.
[2:31:23] <OneThousandTomatoes> also mounting is a lot kess common, about once per hunt
[2:31:25] <%GarbageNirvana> Guess what, it was always anime bullshit
[2:31:28] <BlueSpartan119> @ShutUpAceyP 4 star village
[2:31:31] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Is ledge attack spam still possible is in Rise?
[2:31:34] <%GarbageNirvana> You just see it now because it's in Monster Hunter Japan
[2:31:42] <sonofthedeepsouth> Crazy
[2:31:45] <%YakumoYomi> The blue should be around the damage number
[2:31:47] <ChungusQuest> @scarman125 is there anything about this game that *doesn't* scream anime bullshit?
[2:31:48] <%rinnsi> if you dont thin monster hunter is anime bullshit, you havn't played monster hunter
[2:32:03] <OneThousandTomatoes> the wirebug isnt too insane
[2:32:05] <TheRealNumberJ42> dude is swinging around a sword bigger than himself its always anime bullshit
[2:32:16] <HypeArbalest> ^
[2:32:25] <sonofthedeepsouth> aaaaaanime
[2:32:31] <KasiCrafter> Maybe look in the Huntr's Notes?
[2:32:40] <PleaseCallMeSugar> monster hunter has always been anime bullshit
[2:32:43] <$RealThiele> swinging ribs bigger than him LUL
[2:32:46] <PleaseCallMeSugar> and will always be anime bullshit
[2:32:54] <$Stari> I’m pretty sure that move goes through attacks
[2:32:55] <+Double_Tap_That> @patstaresat Other than switching the Silkbind attacks, have you seen any other way to change your moveset, or is HH stuck with the new mechanics?
[2:33:08] <ChungusQuest> That sword is almost as big as a WH40k pauldron
[2:33:11] <nukle0nik> @PleaseCallMeSugar wish it'd be anime bullshit on a platform that could run the game properly tho
[2:33:31] <scarman125> would you like it if Elden Ring comes out and you can just Spiderman all over the map? i think its a detriment to the combat.
[2:33:32] <%Monkeyweed21> @Double_Tap_That HH alternate move is going back to classic perform, albeit much faster and more streamlined
[2:33:33] <OneThousandTomatoes> game runs great
[2:33:47] <+rbakervv> @Double_Tap_That it's not just silkband attacks, other attacks can be swtiched out, order you learn them depends on weapon
[2:33:54] <rosabellamelantha> you know how you can immediately throw bombs down in the air now with wirebugs? try doing that to basarios when he burrows @PatStaresAt
[2:33:58] <%baka_sugoi> psaDogchamp FEET
[2:34:06] <Evendrag> that new canteen animation made me cry
[2:34:09] <PleaseCallMeSugar> lmao the game's running and it's playable from the look of the stream
[2:34:12] <%SirGO0SE> pls dont forget about Kenshi next week, I was looking forward to it the mostest
[2:34:16] <+Double_Tap_That> Thanks chat.
[2:34:18] <%GarbageNirvana> @scarman125 Yes, yes I would
[2:34:23] <%Monkeyweed21> yes you do
[2:34:25] <yourliteraldog> aquire boom balls
[2:34:49] <yourliteraldog> you got so dung bombs

[2:35:37] <nukle0nik> so this is how they recycle all those Wii U assets
[2:35:41] <$RealThiele> headcrabs chillin
[2:35:42] <rosabellamelantha> not*
[2:35:43] <rReizs> 3 inspired maps but crazy verticality added
[2:35:44] <%whyskeywolfe> These rhymes
[2:35:45] <HeroToxiko> i always wonderes what was down there
[2:35:45] <%rinnsi> these parts in wyverian are super wierd
[2:35:45] <%Monkeyweed21> yea thats new
[2:35:54] <OneThousandTomatoes> volvidon?
[2:35:59] <%BoxNavy> im starting to think this game is an homage to 3rd gen 🤔
[2:35:59] <+jofrankii> this map isnsick
[2:36:04] <HeroToxiko> YEEEEEAAAAAAAAAH BOI
[2:36:05] <nukle0nik> i bet this poetry was a lot more impressive in japanese
[2:36:16] <SaltyAzteca> Haiku Kappa
[2:36:18] <HeroToxiko> oh
[2:36:21] <HeroToxiko> nevermind
[2:36:32] <OneThousandTomatoes> ive never faught basarios
[2:36:34] <%BestTeaMaker> oh is this laser boi
[2:36:34] <mike2hands> your favorite PAT
[2:36:37] <Evendrag> its so cool

[2:36:39] <mike2hands> CLINK CLINK
[2:36:41] <HeroToxiko> LMFAO he's just a rock now
[2:36:41] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> yep
[2:36:46] <%rinnsi> Hopefully hes more fun to fight than old Basarios.
[2:36:46] <mike2hands> it is
[2:36:50] <rosabellamelantha> Black Gravios is legitimately the worst ever
[2:36:51] <PleaseCallMeSugar> I hate Gravios so fucking much but it's so gratifying to slaughter
[2:36:52] <scarman125> @nukle0nik I wouldn't have even realized it was supposed to be poetry if you didn't say so
[2:36:55] <%Monkeyweed21> no thats Konchu\
[2:36:55] <OneThousandTomatoes> looks like kt
[2:36:57] <Ravioli_Ronin> Basarios dawson
[2:37:01] <rosabellamelantha> it's not it's just super similar
[2:37:03] <yourliteraldog> haiku honestly pretty overrated don't at me
[2:37:04] <dan_g_v> everything is from tri :3
[2:37:05] <+theballad_tft> GLAD YOU BROUGHT YOUR FIRE WEAPON TO THE VOLCANO MONSTER
[2:37:05] <+TheBitingIrish> Just get a higher sharpness 4Head
[2:37:09] <%Monkeyweed21> yea this part is the same
[2:37:10] <antimatter_man> Afraid of a little bounce?
[2:37:13] <rosabellamelantha> probably an intentional homage
[2:37:17] <%ClericOfSparda> It probably sounds more poetic in JP
[2:37:22] <%rumtumtugnutz> Seriously, though, Hunter Pat sounds like a Street Shark
[2:37:37] <+TheBitingIrish> I heard someone say they're like ghost stories in Japanese
[2:37:37] <OneThousandTomatoes> its more horror movie like in jp
[2:37:38] <Sapphire_Breeze> good
[2:37:39] <yourliteraldog> Jawsome
[2:37:39] <+Stormzcales_Lair> WUTT
[2:37:43] <Evendrag> such good news
[2:37:43] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> wait really?
[2:37:46] <%Monkeyweed21> yea this is very different
[2:37:47] <scarman125> I hate hot and cold drinks so I'm all for it.,
[2:37:50] <%Frost_Quill> Oh you can cut grass like Link.
[2:37:52] <$Afterman_> it's the best
[2:38:00] <Xenioplate> Thank god, fuck hot and cold drinks
[2:38:20] <luciluxlu0> did you just yoshi zangief?
[2:38:34] <scarman125> gotta love invisible walls
[2:38:37] <Evendrag> look at this arena
[2:38:42] <halfmasks> also no need for cold drinks helps
[2:38:58] <%LegendGHT> Does this Monster Hunter seem too streamlined for you? that's all i'm worried about
[2:38:59] <OneThousandTomatoes> wont let you fall in lava :(
[2:39:02] <Evendrag> killed the only plants in the area, great
[2:39:06] <%walternatorz> why is pat attacking foliage?
[2:39:08] <rReizs> on the other hand stamina goes down a bit faster it seems
[2:39:09] <+TheBitingIrish> This place is fucking rad
[2:39:11] <yourliteraldog> Under mormon law anything with caffeine is a hot drink
[2:39:16] <silent__chief> this map is crazy
[2:39:18] <%BoxNavy> wow
[2:39:19] <+ReallyBigRocks> Man, Pat's really gettin around. This movement seems good
[2:39:20] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt this map is probably the one I have the least experience mental mapping out because it's fucking HUGE dude
[2:39:33] <PerfectPepperPlantPro> Agnaktor come on in
[2:39:54] <nukle0nik> the walking mountain
[2:40:03] <OneThousandTomatoes> yeah looks like a perfect place for laser fish

[2:40:50] <$RealThiele> kobe
[2:40:50] <rReizs> hes the same as always but now easier to not bounce off

[2:41:52] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> that's new
[2:41:55] <%GarbageNirvana> Basarios is a monster for blunt weapons

[2:45:44] <$RealThiele> feed pupper
[2:45:54] <%Monkeyweed21> Basarios really is just a shitty Akantor
[2:46:02] <%Monkeyweed21> Agnaktor
[2:46:07] <SlippedDisco> dude the momentum in basarios fights has totally changed now
[2:46:15] <rosabellamelantha> depth perception is the true monster
[2:46:19] <SaltyAzteca> he mad
[2:46:20] <antimatter_man> Not that one tho
[2:46:22] <%BoxNavy> u love it
[2:46:24] <Ashecroft> I look forward to seeing who else comes along in the Chameleos update
[2:46:25] <hakumaribo> "Making Basarios fun to fight" is not a sentence i thought i'd ever hear...
[2:46:43] <OneThousandTomatoes> fuck yeah
[2:46:46] <blackbookalpha> some silkbinds can do that
[2:46:49] <+wizard_of_diamonds> I have never heard of or seen this monster before
[2:46:58] <%rinnsi> who knew all we needed to make basarios fun was being able to avoid his stupid shit
[2:46:59] <rosabellamelantha> good
[2:47:00] <rosabellamelantha> he sucks
[2:47:07] <antimatter_man> Does his tail come off I forget
[2:47:09] <+wizard_of_diamonds> I come from MHW only I'm afraid
[2:47:11] <gallohuegos> gravios also sucks
[2:47:12] <+zanzibar_junker> I hated fighting him in 4U
[2:47:13] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> basarios and gravios SUCK
[2:47:14] <OneThousandTomatoes> oof
[2:47:18] <SlippedDisco> not very Fun
[2:47:18] <rosabellamelantha> he is also the baby form of Gravios
[2:47:19] <%baka_sugoi> fire bad
[2:47:19] <%BoxNavy> moon2W ive only fought him in 4 and it was miserable
[2:47:22] <fran031> Really? I was pretty sure he was gen3
[2:47:24] <rosabellamelantha> another TERRIBLE monster
[2:47:30] <%rinnsi> They all need super massive reworks
[2:47:31] <mike2hands> they're cheap ass hell
[2:47:32] <+TheBitingIrish> Yea, like Raths' doodDerp
[2:47:32] <%hrbeck_> his tail does come off, it's puny
[2:47:33] <%Ranryu692> why did you stand in lava Pat
[2:47:33] <SlippedDisco> @zanzibar_junker oh yeah he SUCKS in 4U
[2:47:34] <PleaseCallMeSugar> basarios the awkward teen
[2:47:41] <$RealThiele> 20 now
[2:47:42] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Sounds good
[2:47:44] <AllenDeadman> yeah he got a revamp
[2:47:46] <%BoxNavy> oh rathalos is way better in this game btw
[2:47:47] <%Ranryu692> carve!
[2:47:47] <Ashecroft> Its Gravios that Basarios becomes, isnt it?
[2:47:54] <hakumaribo> the wirebug functions make this shit amazing
[2:47:56] <%Monkeyweed21> it took like 15 years for Fatalis to be interesting
[2:47:58] <%rinnsi> even rathalos instant run shit from 1 has never been changed and i hate it
[2:47:59] <PleaseCallMeSugar> can't carve a cap
[2:47:59] <TheLordOfTheScrubs> Not even just a MH1 monster, he's a crappy babby version of another monster
[2:48:01] <gallohuegos> I hated gravios' slow walking laser
[2:48:01] <Evendrag> its got everything
[2:48:08] <%GarbageNirvana> The Raths are the rare monsters that Capcom got in one
[2:48:20] <rosabellamelantha> they didn't
[2:48:25] <rosabellamelantha> the raths sucked originally
[2:48:25] <fireadept> I wish duramboros would come back
[2:48:26] <cacophanes> *cough*yian garuga*cough*
[2:48:30] <blackbookalpha> @PatStaresAt Tell us about the crab-claw PSP days
[2:48:33] <rosabellamelantha> they became great later
[2:48:33] <TheWolfkonig> Cheer500 Watching a Gremlin smacking around dinosaurs. Cool.
[2:48:36] <PleaseCallMeSugar> wasn't Rathian's tailflip something that was added in Tri?
[2:48:42] <%BoxNavy> i dont but theyre actually fun in rise
[2:48:44] <%Monkeyweed21> it took 15 YEARS to make Fatalis a good fight
[2:48:52] <rosabellamelantha> but does anyone remember when they would fly around the arena for a FULL MINUTE
[2:49:01] <rosabellamelantha> Rathalos and Rathian used to be terrible
[2:49:01] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @PleaseCallMeSugar nope, always had it
[2:49:02] <PerfectPepperPlantPro> @PleaseCallMeSugar Oooooh noooo
[2:49:02] <+SilverDevilfish> Monoblos is so insignificant no one remembers it even exists Kappa
[2:49:07] <%rinnsi> wad the tailflip new in Tri? jeez
[2:49:08] <fireadept> i miss my spinning mountain monster
[2:49:14] <cacophanes> member when pink rathalos had no charge up on its tail flip?
[2:49:19] <PerfectPepperPlantPro> I liked silver Monoblos :(
[2:49:25] <%BoxNavy> 1 horn
[2:49:27] <+tetraes> woah that sword is sick what is it?
[2:49:29] <rosabellamelantha> He's worse diablos
[2:49:29] <AllenDeadman> Diablos but worse
[2:49:30] <WizardofAahz> @fireadept me too bro
[2:49:30] <fran031> Monoblos is just boring
[2:49:31] <+Catpurnicus> lol I remember I bought my first PSP used and it came with some fucked up Monster Hunter claw grip adapter
[2:49:37] <%Artemis_Scowl> @SilverDevilfish god i remember monoblos, only now after reading this
[2:49:38] <%Monkeyweed21> worse Diablos
[2:49:38] <PleaseCallMeSugar> it would be really interesting if it swung its horn more like a sword or a lance
[2:49:38] <OneThousandTomatoes> diablos with one horn?
[2:49:42] <SaltyAzteca> isnt it just a diablos moveset LUL
[2:49:46] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> I do kinda like white monoblos, was cool in 4u, but is basically a more grounded diablos
[2:49:47] <IceXAura> A cool armor design and thats it
[2:49:47] <%BoxNavy> what if they make triablos monkaS
[2:49:48] <$RealThiele> d o o t
[2:50:03] <gallohuegos> bloodbath diablos was cool
[2:50:05] <Evendrag> is monoblos worse or easier then diablos?
[2:50:05] <PerfectPepperPlantPro> Its diablos but with better armor and a worse design
[2:50:06] <%GarbageNirvana> Monoblos exists as the skull that Daimyo Hermitaur uses as a shell
[2:50:06] <Absurd_Lizard> quadablos monkaS
[2:50:07] <%rinnsi> Monoblos is kind of the perfect definition of a terrible subspecies
[2:50:08] <%GarbageNirvana> And that's it
[2:50:14] <Broand> GUNHAMMER GUNHAMMER
[2:50:19] <%Monkeyweed21> GUN HAMMER
[2:50:20] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> oh boy gun hammer is back
[2:50:25] <+jofrankii> yeyeyeyeyeye
[2:50:26] <PerfectPepperPlantPro> Speaking of. Where be the crabs
[2:50:28] <@commanderclaw> He's a teenager, so he's ornery
[2:50:31] <+jofrankii> Hammer time!!!
[2:50:31] <Zourath> Centablos. Just a ball of spikes.
[2:50:32] <blackbookalpha> the legend
[2:50:34] <rosabellamelantha> I hate diablos continues to have the worst fucking armour in the series
[2:50:35] <yourliteraldog> hunting horn?
[2:50:36] <SaltyAzteca> ah blames the rayap Kappa
[2:50:42] <$RealThiele> basarios blow
[2:50:43] <rosabellamelantha> especially the female diablos armour
[2:50:43] <+allups> u did ight
[2:50:46] <rosabellamelantha> its so bad
[2:50:47] <%Frost_Quill> Was that Basarios' face on that hammer?
[2:50:51] <%baka_sugoi> is it his HEAD evo15MindBlown
[2:50:52] <yourliteraldog> thats sick
[2:50:54] <PleaseCallMeSugar> oh they fixed it up a bit
[2:51:01] <TheLordOfTheScrubs> @Frost_Quill yes it was
[2:51:05] <%Monkeyweed21> funlance armor
[2:51:26] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> that gs brings back memories
[2:51:29] <%blaggablag> They seem to have taken the armor design towards a much more fun direction
[2:51:36] <PleaseCallMeSugar> basarios pet stuff?
[2:51:44] <PerfectPepperPlantPro> Basarios is in ore I thinks
[2:51:45] <fireadept> what did you think of those mohran elder dragon battles on the ships from earlier games?
[2:51:48] <PleaseCallMeSugar> YOO
[2:51:53] <Absurd_Lizard> goofy
[2:51:56] <yourliteraldog> CRUSTLE DOG
[2:51:57] <%rinnsi> i might actually use that, wow
[2:51:58] <blackbookalpha> lol that's a WoW mount
[2:51:58] <+allups> megaman
[2:51:59] <%baka_sugoi> ROBO GIEF
[2:51:59] <OneThousandTomatoes> cute
[2:52:02] <+TheBitingIrish> That's a fucking zord
[2:52:03] <%GarbageNirvana> Which armor set makes your dog look like Friender
[2:52:10] <PleaseCallMeSugar> World of Warcraft doggo
[2:52:11] <TheLordOfTheScrubs> what set is pat using now? looks pretty dope
[2:52:19] <choopercabra> by the handle
[2:52:20] <$RealThiele> whirlygig is cool
[2:52:20] <%hrbeck_> fucking megaman dog
[2:52:21] <OneThousandTomatoes> pizza cutter
[2:52:24] <PerfectPepperPlantPro> At the shaft, of course
[2:52:28] <Virokwet> is that a pizza cutter?
[2:52:36] <+Opal_Overture> Did they change the "Everything's the same, except this one has feather/scales" problem of MHW, or did they just add a few more wacky things to keep you from thinking that?
[2:52:37] <%rinnsi> Aknosom it looks like?
[2:52:37] <yourliteraldog> It looks like pizza cutter going through it death metal phase
[2:52:57] <%BoxNavy> no
[2:53:06] <Virokwet> when you work at your dads pizza shop but you wanna rep you lyfestyle
[2:53:09] <%Broand> you can probably send meowcenaries to get those pelts
[2:53:14] <+RowenCleric> @Opal_Overture yea so far it looks like way more variety
[2:53:16] <PleaseCallMeSugar> Okay so concept: A Ceadeus siege hunt, Jhen Mohran style
[2:53:27] <OneThousandTomatoes> volvidon?
[2:53:30] <rosabellamelantha> @Opal_Overture the weapons are back to how they were in the classic games, as in actually good
[2:53:46] <PerfectPepperPlantPro> @Opal_Overture Nah that's just MH in general, there are only so much 'skeletons' and monsters are differentiated by 'skeleton+scales and/orfeathers'
[2:53:48] <SlippedDisco> D:
[2:53:48] <+Opal_Overture> @RowenCleric Finally, a good modern MH game...
[2:53:48] <rosabellamelantha> I like world but man
[2:53:50] <Absurd_Lizard> D:
[2:53:50] <rosabellamelantha> the weapons
[2:53:51] <%rinnsi> @rosabellamelantha world weaposn were legitimatly terrible
[2:53:52] <rosabellamelantha> were so bad
[2:53:54] <yourliteraldog> Pussy no balls
[2:53:58] <LordOfThePoultry> D:
[2:54:00] <%baka_sugoi> psaDogchamp "NOT MY BALLS FATHER"
[2:54:00] <%asgard147> WutFace limesD
[2:54:02] <%Treuan> His balls and optimism: gone
[2:54:02] <+cahv123> And that's not an idle threat either. Balls off.
[2:54:08] <+Opal_Overture> @PerfectPepperPlantPro Weapons, not monsters, but fair.
[2:54:12] <$RealThiele> weed time
[2:54:13] <%Monkeyweed21> NO BALLS JUST LIKE HIS DAD
[2:54:20] <%Frost_Quill> "Legendary herb" is that what the kids are calling it now?
[2:54:26] <yourliteraldog> I also call going to the Dispensary Getting Groceries
[2:54:30] <PerfectPepperPlantPro> @Opal_Overture Eh, same difference almost
[2:54:47] <OneThousandTomatoes> can you
[2:54:51] <blackbookalpha> warp pipe go
[2:54:54] <rosabellamelantha> I legitimately got lost for almost an hour in this map because of how huge and interconnected it is
[2:54:55] <%Monkeyweed21> JUMP
[2:54:56] <dan_g_v> wat
[2:54:58] <%blaggablag> If the dlc map for this game ends up being a remake of desert island I can die happy
[2:55:03] <TheRealNumberJ42> this hole it was made for me
[2:55:12] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> that looks kinda nice
[2:55:16] <Fefe41> I was really hoping for a dark souls YOU DIED message there
[2:55:28] <%Broand> Can you ride those geysers up I wonder?
[2:55:38] <silent__chief> I LOVE BIOMES
[2:55:55] <%BoxNavy> is desert island that one place where you fight seregios and cephadrome and them
[2:55:56] <%BoxNavy> ?
[2:55:58] <%primarch_lupercal> wait is she making weed dangos
[2:56:07] <%Monkeyweed21> the secret ingredient in Dango is love. Love and peyote
[2:56:15] <%Broand> pffft
[2:56:16] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @BoxNavy it's the main 3u area
[2:56:20] <OneThousandTomatoes> LUL
[2:56:25] <yourliteraldog> But unlike the punk bitch yoshi he can climb back up
[2:56:28] <%AzureGale> No air control LUL
[2:56:48] <%Monkeyweed21> What if they brought back Dire Miralis
[2:56:51] <+Opal_Overture> @PerfectPepperPlantPro Not really? Or, at least, the problem was GREATLY INCREASED in World, because they literally used the same model for 60% of the weapons for each tree and type
[2:56:53] <OneThousandTomatoes> every time
[2:56:54] <+PomegranateKing> What hunter rank is he up to?
[2:57:07] <yourliteraldog> Don't judge Lead Paint taste great
[2:57:08] <$HyperionXV> Starting on rank 4s
[2:57:11] <rosabellamelantha> Hey Dire was fun when he was on land
[2:57:23] <TheLordOfTheScrubs> I'd go back to the claw grip if they brought back Dire DansGame
[2:57:26] <%blaggablag> I'd replay a remade darhen moran
[2:57:27] <%Frost_Quill> What if they brought it back but made it good like the rocky boy you just fought?
[2:57:30] <+PomegranateKing> Cool, Pat is on par with me!
[2:57:31] <%blaggablag> shit was fun
[2:57:33] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Can you roll off a ledge and charge attack back on?

[2:58:05] <TheRealNumberJ42> dope
[2:58:07] <%Monkeyweed21> looks like the Nakarkos arena
[2:58:08] <T_Sasquatch> I had to play with a barroth switch axe for so long in world NotLikeThis
[2:58:09] <OneThousandTomatoes> what mon is that?
[2:58:09] <LordOfThePoultry> less rotten tho
[2:58:11] <+jofrankii> such a cool map
[2:58:14] <halfmasks> so this is the fire and toxic zone
[2:58:14] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> this feels very early in the game for volcano area, going by tradition at least
[2:58:15] <%rumtumtugnutz> that's a melted dragon
[2:58:22] <fran031> When's Yama Tsukami coming back?

[3:00:34] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @Quinn_Carter first debuted in 3u
[3:00:44] <+jofrankii> LUL
[3:00:45] <%blaggablag> Do we have the area where you overlook the caldera in this version? I loved that bit in the original
[3:00:55] <%Broand> from the bottom maybe?
[3:01:03] <%Monkeyweed21> wirebug ip
[3:01:04] <%rumtumtugnutz> that was an unfortunate shortcut
[3:01:05] <rosabellamelantha> you can
[3:01:11] <+PomegranateKing> Started from the bottom, now we're here
[3:01:12] <%Broand> I mean couldn't hurt to try
[3:01:14] <rosabellamelantha> just go back in the crawlspace
[3:01:18] <rosabellamelantha> and wallrun up
[3:01:20] <%walternatorz> dig up?
[3:01:53] <rosabellamelantha> hole

[3:01:58] <rosabellamelantha> to*
[3:02:02] <%Monkeyweed21> psaBlind
[3:02:15] <yourliteraldog> Fun Fact Some volcanos burn blue. Double fun fact they are also more poisonus than normal volcanos.
[3:02:35] <+PomegranateKing> I was starting to get Last of Us vibes
[3:02:41] <%blaggablag> OH THERE IT IS
[3:02:42] <yourliteraldog> Sulfur sucks ass
[3:02:43] <antimatter_man> Incredible
[3:02:44] <OneThousandTomatoes> noe jump in
[3:02:46] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @Quinn_Carter I don't want to remember, that one area in forest and hills was insanity
[3:02:56] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Getting flashbacks to the secret dragon skeleton ontop of the mountain in iceborne
[3:02:59] <rosabellamelantha> there's more above
[3:03:12] <Oxybe> -+-
[3:03:14] <+PomegranateKing> You're in my bathroom on Taco Tuesday
[3:03:37] <%blaggablag> Yeah it would've been area 8 in the original
[3:03:42] <+carafe741> someone can get up there, but it might not be you
[3:03:45] <yourliteraldog> That is a lava lakethat also has lava being poured into it.
[3:04:02] <%Broand> TOSS THE RING
[3:04:05] <+jofrankii> fucking lotr shit right there
[3:04:13] <blackbookalpha> pee in the lava
[3:04:16] <blackbookalpha> its the only way
[3:04:18] <+carafe741> @yourliteraldog magma chamber haha
[3:04:19] <rosabellamelantha> Not really anything in here besides the relic but it looks like mount doom
[3:04:22] <rosabellamelantha> so worth seeing
[3:04:30] <%blaggablag> correction, area 10
[3:04:33] <+PomegranateKing> You know Pat would keep the ring @Broand
[3:04:35] <+RowenCleric> ass was just melted by lava
[3:04:42] <mike2hands> i missed agnaktor
[3:04:44] <%rumtumtugnutz> Don't pee in the lava, it might explode
[3:04:45] <%Broand> Yeah, he would
[3:04:49] <mike2hands> i miss"
[3:04:55] <blackbookalpha> and collect
[3:04:58] <OneThousandTomatoes> it is
[3:05:00] <+Quinn_Carter> Weren't they always?
[3:05:00] <ronyoshi> and his finger would be bitten off too
[3:05:02] <rosabellamelantha> they probably are
[3:05:11] <%rumtumtugnutz> of course they are
[3:05:18] <%solracc25> sure are
[3:05:19] <antimatter_man> Yeah but thats not terrible
[3:05:29] <%rumtumtugnutz> they want you to see the environmentsw they made
[3:05:31] <OneThousandTomatoes> i hope whatever new maps they bring later are like this one
[3:05:31] <antimatter_man> it looks nice so I dont mind exploring
[3:05:36] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> jesus this map really is huge
[3:05:38] <%BubbaRands> As if I need an excuse to ride a giant puppet LUL
[3:05:54] <KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt Hey do you think we'll get a MonHun World 2 next, a Rise 2 or some other name?
[3:05:56] <+PomegranateKing> Got the herbs! Now smoke up!
[3:05:57] <%rumtumtugnutz> No game designer wants you to only see the parts of the game you have to
[3:05:58] <yourliteraldog> Also judging by the color of the water and it's proximity to the volcano that water is probably actually acid
[3:05:58] <%BubbaRands> *pupper
[3:06:10] <OneThousandTomatoes> other name
[3:06:22] <cacophanes> where's pigcat tho
[3:06:23] <TheZearGuy> Can monsters still be trapped rather than killed?
[3:06:36] <yourliteraldog> yes
[3:06:45] <%Broand> Yeah you can trap them like every monhun
[3:06:45] <%rumtumtugnutz> are you going to get Zangief an armor
[3:06:49] <%asgard147> limesAw psaDogchamp
[3:06:53] <Devbob98> Where’s Elmo?

[3:07:19] <+PomegranateKing> @PanicSwytch Which one would be the mount?
[3:07:22] <rosabellamelantha> this is why the complaints about the number of maps are kinda dumb imo, these maps are MASSIVE, maybe the biggest the series has had without them being bad like ancient forest
[3:07:26] <%BubbaRands> That boi heckin chonk
[3:07:40] <olgafl0w> i cant wait for that stupid walking fish with a broking hit box to show up and hip check across the map Kappa

[3:08:31] <blackbookalpha> Sure-you-can
[3:08:35] <Ashecroft> Zangief gets a frisbee

[3:13:21] <+PomegranateKing> Pat throws trash on the ground specifically to kill endangered species
[3:13:51] <%Treuan> Rathians are opossum
[3:13:54] <akitanito> rathians are pigeons of MH
[3:13:57] <%Frost_Quill> They're common because they're the mascots.
[3:13:59] <OneThousandTomatoes> max says capturing is for cowards
[3:13:59] <+Gespens> If Monster Hunter is "What if the whole world was Australia," Rathians are Kangaroos
[3:14:00] <PleaseCallMeSugar> raths are the pigeons of the monster hunter world
[3:14:07] <cacophanes> Love how Gief is as loud as the coffee machine
[3:14:07] <rosabellamelantha> Rathians are literally considered a pest in universe because of how much they breed @PatStaresAt
[3:14:10] <Devbob98> Poacher Pat arc
[3:14:14] <+PomegranateKing> Rathians probably have their own civilization on an island somewhere with rathalos
[3:14:29] <+Gespens> Rathians are so goddamn horny, they breed with other species!
[3:14:32] <antimatter_man> Oh man this makes me want to fight nibelsnarf

[3:15:05] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> that camp is definitely familiar
[3:15:12] <PleaseCallMeSugar> what the fuck is going on with the audio distortion
[3:15:15] <yourliteraldog> Do you think sell the captured animals to Chinese Bussiness Men looking to get hard in this universe too.
[3:15:17] <+PomegranateKing> I give it 12 minutes. Anyone want in on the betting pool?
[3:15:18] <Wolfstriker121> it is 100%
[3:15:24] <%primarch_lupercal> ooh love that dusk lighting
[3:15:28] <+TheBitingIrish> @PleaseCallMeSugar Nothing wrong on my end
[3:15:36] <%ArchimerCXV> did the devs not say it was simply '3 plus time'?
[3:15:41] <spawnzie> yeah the top right area is were you first encounter diablos in tri
[3:15:46] <OneThousandTomatoes> channel point betting?
[3:15:52] <PleaseCallMeSugar> it's exclusively with the intro song to this map, it sounds like a dying VHS
[3:16:03] <rosabellamelantha> they also added a SHIT TON of depth of the ruins of the ancient city that were in the original
[3:16:06] <Wolfstriker121> ouchh
[3:16:07] <akitanito> big whiffs
[3:16:09] <Devbob98> Practice swing

[3:16:33] <antimatter_man> Almost hype
[3:16:35] <%BubbaRands> Rathian lookin thicc today
[3:17:11] <Manwad> I can hear the godzilla sound effect in its roar LUL
[3:17:12] <PleaseCallMeSugar> it's all that running she does
[3:17:17] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @BubbaRands bonk
[3:17:36] <AllenDeadman> WAIT EVEN RATHIAN'S THEME HAS VOCALS?
[3:17:47] <$scallycap> why does Pat's character sound like Ox King?
[3:18:23] <akitanito> just tank all the fireballs
[3:18:54] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt one of the main things that makes it somewhat difficult to recognize this compared to flooded forest is one of the more memorable locations in this place in 3U was Baroth's mud hole which is SUPER different in design here
[3:18:56] <+PomegranateKing> mid-tier? ... maybe she was, at one point
[3:19:00] <%CalderGaming> @scallycap he picked it cuz it sounds kind of like The Macho Man
[3:19:06] <yourliteraldog> jukes
[3:19:06] <+DuppyConQR> that's a big ass rathian
[3:19:18] <rosabellamelantha> is it?
[3:19:21] <+ALazo> rathian is the shoto of monsters
[3:19:23] <jorniev> kinda sad he didnt play kenshi
[3:19:24] <rosabellamelantha> looks normal size to me
[3:19:27] <Devbob98> Damn that bluff
[3:19:31] <s1rcuit> I thought Rathian couldn't spit fireballs
[3:19:34] <$StrawberryPantsu> Thiian or Los?
[3:19:44] <+PomegranateKing> Take off that tail! Use it like a club!
[3:19:47] <antimatter_man> Dog got okami moves?
[3:19:48] <rosabellamelantha> No she always could
[3:19:52] <+DuppyConQR> it looks rathalos-sized
[3:20:09] <+PomegranateKing> Dude you embody the too greedy meme
[3:20:10] <%Broand> This theme is super waltzy
[3:20:10] <blackbookalpha> smaller, since its male
[3:20:21] <rosabellamelantha> the difference between Rathian and Rathalos is she's better at ground combat whereas rathalos sticks to the skies more
[3:20:41] <fran031> Has this always been the Rathian's theme? I don't remember it being such a banger
[3:20:46] <+HelloImTom08> it looks so much faster
[3:20:47] <PleaseCallMeSugar> read: rathalos never fucking lands and ruins your entire day if you can't force him down
[3:20:48] <OneThousandTomatoes> queen of the land, king of the skies
[3:20:56] <rosabellamelantha> rathian doesn't have a theme
[3:20:59] <OneThousandTomatoes> court is in session
[3:21:00] <PleaseCallMeSugar> this is a new theme
[3:21:08] <PleaseCallMeSugar> this is the theme for this area
[3:21:08] <+legend_of_nolan> YOOO
[3:21:10] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @fran031 rathian never really had a theme, it's just the general area theme
[3:21:12] <rosabellamelantha> this is the theme of the area
[3:21:38] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> poggers, a spike
[3:21:44] <blackbookalpha> wait that's dumb it can poison you even with the tail cut off?
[3:21:49] <rosabellamelantha> Now Rathian/Rathalos's ACTUAL theme is Forest and Hills but capcom refuse to acknowledge it
[3:21:53] <Varanoo> Poggers
[3:21:54] <+PomegranateKing> Get that material on the ground!
[3:21:57] <+Watterx> materials he dropped
[3:22:04] <Absurd_Lizard> is dis ez or is pat good?
[3:22:04] <antimatter_man> Nice tailspike
[3:22:07] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Rathian was my wall in LR MHW
[3:22:08] <OneThousandTomatoes> pat have you played any balan wonderland? its..."special"
[3:22:12] <spawnzie> the whole tail is lined with poison spines
[3:22:13] <IminyourBase> your character talking is upsetting
[3:22:18] <+wizard_of_diamonds> I had such a bad time against her for so long I almost dropped the game
[3:22:19] <+Gespens> the spines are poisonous, the tail just has a high concentration of the spines is the biological answer
[3:22:20] <Evendrag> yeaheheh
[3:22:25] <iq_dropper> Man, I really like that GS design
[3:22:26] <kes009900> "this bug is my wife"
[3:22:26] <PleaseCallMeSugar> please check her armor skills, confirm whether or not it's dogshit
[3:22:27] <%solracc25> Chocobo Knight
[3:22:29] <AllenDeadman> yoooo
[3:22:33] <PleaseCallMeSugar> rathian armor is always either busted or trash
[3:22:33] <rosabellamelantha> I want forest and hills in Rise style after seeing rathian tbh @PatStaresAt
[3:22:36] <yourliteraldog> Oh yeah diffently selling that rathian to the main landers so they can make soups and boner potiions
[3:22:44] <antimatter_man> Ayy thats pretty good
[3:22:47] <IminyourBase> zangief he honk snore
[3:22:50] <+Watterx> snorey boi
[3:22:53] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> I wonder which rathian armor design they went with here
[3:23:14] <rosabellamelantha> OLD rathian huh
[3:23:14] <PleaseCallMeSugar> WOW IT'S TRASH FUCKING GARBAGE
[3:23:20] <Evendrag> yep, thats the rathian set
[3:23:22] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> ah, the older design, I kinda like the newer one a bit more
[3:23:42] <antimatter_man> Good shit good shit
[3:23:44] <+PomegranateKing> night all!
[3:23:47] <%BubbaRands> Yup that’s a rathian set
[3:23:49] <rosabellamelantha> I have no opinions on either because I play female and every single rathian set has the dumb skirt
[3:23:54] <$scallycap> did Pat get Zangief just so that he could put him in Rise?
[3:23:55] <OneThousandTomatoes> roll out
[3:24:02] <susukouhai> time for some hot tongue action
[3:24:03] <blackbookalpha> remember your izuchi pelts
[3:24:05] <IminyourBase> when you use the silkbug to zip out of the way do you drop your combo with GS or can you get a TTS out of it?
[3:24:28] <PleaseCallMeSugar> really sad to see that rathian armor is still utter dogshit, I really like its design
[3:24:36] <IminyourBase> that's unfortunate. they keep shoulder charge though?
[3:24:39] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> he rollin
[3:24:39] <blackbookalpha> become ORB
[3:24:41] <OneThousandTomatoes> so goofy
[3:24:45] <jotabranded> hate this bitch

[3:29:59] <IminyourBase> that was fast
[3:29:59] <dan_g_v> the missing chunks of armor look painful
[3:30:01] <fran031> Christ, you destroyed him, poor boy
[3:30:05] <%BubbaRands> CORNER EM SwiftRage
[3:30:20] <OneThousandTomatoes> pat how could you kill your spirit animal
[3:30:24] <IminyourBase> it's round, smelly and orange like pat.
[3:30:26] <+LazyBumNetwork> Is this on pc?
[3:30:33] <%Valdorick> Valdorick subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 19 months! Monster Hunter: Rise, more like Monster Hunter: Raise da roof, because this game is lit, fam... ha ha... ha... ugh.
[3:30:35] <+Bluecille> Switch
[3:30:36] <PleaseCallMeSugar> switch
[3:30:37] <susukouhai> even tho it's lowrank that is p fast damn
[3:30:38] <$RealThiele> pc in 2022
[3:30:38] <notsoy> the cat and dog seems so much stronger than what i remember from 4u
[3:30:40] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @LazyBumNetwork in a year
[3:30:45] <yourliteraldog> Pat is to soft to be armadillo
[3:30:55] <yourliteraldog> Anteater is more like him
[3:30:55] <+LazyBumNetwork> Oh goodie.
[3:31:02] <%Frost_Quill> @OneThousandTomatoes He didn't, it's been captured to be turned into boner pills and boner potions.
[3:31:09] <yourliteraldog> They t-pose in self defense
[3:31:13] <%Broand> oh! that's cool!
[3:31:13] <+TopTieramisu> SourPls
[3:31:17] <%UltraViolet371> yeah even comparing low ranks, that was a much faster hunt than equivalent World hunts
[3:31:20] <+LazyBumNetwork> How is it so far, chat? I dropped off world.
[3:31:22] <jorniev> are you gonna try kenshi next week?
[3:31:33] <$RealThiele> hojo looking like a dq merchant
[3:31:34] <cacophanes> HOJO?!? DansGame DansGame
[3:31:36] <OneThousandTomatoes> very different from world
[3:31:38] <AllenDeadman> yoooo
[3:31:42] <Evendrag> whaaaaa
[3:31:52] <PleaseCallMeSugar> looks super good so far
[3:31:53] <+jofrankii> yep
[3:32:06] <%Broand> That's super cool
[3:32:06] <AllenDeadman> that is the fucking best
[3:32:09] <OneThousandTomatoes> hojo is based on ebisu, on of the seven gods of fortune
[3:32:22] <blackbookalpha> check cohoot nest
[3:32:35] <PleaseCallMeSugar> check pickle pee
[3:32:46] <yourliteraldog> IN COHOOTS
[3:32:55] <notsoy> man, imagine monster hunters in marvel vs capcom with all this stuff
[3:33:00] <blackbookalpha> lagniapples will be useful for buddies I think
[3:33:04] <Evendrag> yo how do i get more buddies
[3:33:16] <OneThousandTomatoes> how do you make your owl attack people, I know you can do it
[3:33:24] <blackbookalpha> yeah use em, you get better ones later
[3:33:44] <PleaseCallMeSugar> wow they do kind of guzzle spheres though
[3:34:16] <blackbookalpha> you'll be drowning in spheres later
[3:34:28] <%Broand> Hey look at that dude on the roof in the background
[3:34:52] <PleaseCallMeSugar> that's really cool
[3:35:11] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> the number of improvements with each mh is great
[3:35:16] <blackbookalpha> yep 2
[3:35:52] <PleaseCallMeSugar> god I really hope this trend keeps up
[3:35:52] <%Frost_Quill> Yep
[3:35:56] <akitanito> pokemon regresses
[3:35:56] <+TheBitingIrish> Pokemon FeelsBadMan
[3:36:01] <+TopTieramisu> pokemon doesn't need to improve when they get all the money
[3:36:06] <PleaseCallMeSugar> meanwhile pokemon hasn't meaningfully changed in a fucking decade and a half
[3:36:07] <fran031> I hope they keep the wirebugs
[3:36:07] <%BoxNavy> "no" - the pokemon company
[3:36:11] <WeebFever> Oh god why does Stories 2 have to be four MONTHS away
[3:36:13] <blackbookalpha> fair. I got pokedex fatigue in Pokemon Sword/Shield
[3:36:17] <+Opal_Overture> @PleaseCallMeSugar World was the break from the trend, lmao
[3:36:20] <Devbob98> But Pokémon sells no matter what so why try
[3:36:22] <%ExpressNode> Arceus could be the answer if it's good
[3:36:28] <Evendrag> could get more money...
[3:36:33] <PleaseCallMeSugar> I like to hope that World set a new trend
[3:36:35] <TheRealNumberJ42> gamefreak could shit into a game case and it would still sell millions lol
[3:36:36] <Daemyx> it's a good game
[3:36:36] <%czeekytv> GameFreak has 450 employees working for them
[3:36:37] <%Frost_Quill> And Pokemon is the most profitable franchise in the world.
[3:36:38] <PleaseCallMeSugar> especially with that money
[3:36:40] <jotabranded> bro, this is one version of a pokemon mainline
[3:36:40] <iosephe> Pokemon doesn't have game feel
[3:36:45] <+Gespens> Monster Hunter 4U outsold the Pokemon game of that generation  in Japan
[3:36:48] <%TheCallousKing> Pokemon won't change until revenue drops
[3:36:52] <Storm_Samurai> 64 million?!?
[3:36:56] <KasiCrafter> But MHW is when they mixed things up the MOST. So. What they make AFTER is what we should be judging if we're talking about Pokemon always phoning it in.
[3:37:00] <%TheCallousKing> just like EA sports games
[3:37:00] <jones2627> does pat have an OF?
[3:37:03] <%Frost_Quill> Oh that's where the chocobo armor comes from.
[3:37:20] <Evendrag> no, 16 million
[3:37:26] <+TopTieramisu> i'm not defending pokemon. i mean their devs are complacent and milking it like it's shrek
[3:37:28] <%UltraViolet371> @Gespens that's impressive and warms my heart
[3:37:33] <blackbookalpha> I feel like Pokemon games are just expensive interactive ads these days to sell more toys and merch
[3:37:34] <Defm551> im so glad you can turn off player voice, its so damn annoying
[3:37:35] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @KasiCrafter I dunno, both 3 and 4 had pretty big changes, even gen with all the styles
[3:37:38] <+Opal_Overture> @jofrankii god i wish /s
[3:37:38] <Devbob98> Imagine a creature wearing human skin attacking you out of the blue
[3:37:40] <%Puhff> GTA is actually most profitable cuz Online
[3:37:47] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> Pokemon is still one of the most profitable franchises in the world by doing basically nothing
[3:37:48] <%HaloPlayerNamedJohn> I feel like Monster Hunter fans never expect all monsters but always expect a fundamental improvement or significant change
[3:38:24] <%Frost_Quill> I wouldn't care about the "not all Pokemon" thing if they didn't actively lie about the reason for it.
[3:39:02] <%UltraViolet371> oh boy can't wait for yian garuga
[3:39:05] <PleaseCallMeSugar> pokemon avoids innovation because they seem to only gear the games toward the same age bracket every time, and they never develop for long-time fans to the degree that Monster Hunter does - no incentive to change either because the games fucking sell themselves
[3:39:26] <%Broand> I'm gonna clownsuit khezu set with ludroth set just to annoy pat
[3:39:36] <jotabranded> @HaloPlayerNamedJohn except generations, that one have all the monster ever i think
[3:39:55] <elicoy> I play new Pokemon hoping to recapture that childhood feeling of joy from way back in Red and Blue
[3:39:56] <s1rcuit> @PleaseCallMeSugar yeah, the last time the series did anything innovative for me was Gold/Silver
[3:40:02] <+TopTieramisu> pokemon, the simpsons of gaming
[3:40:18] <PleaseCallMeSugar> god it really fucking IS the simpsons of gaming, huh
[3:40:20] <+broaches> well the pain sure did come lmao
[3:40:29] <%ExpressNode> I think Black and White did some innovation
[3:40:32] <s1rcuit> @elicoy do you ever recapture it?
[3:40:40] <fran031> @jotabranded It didn't really have ALL monsters, but most, yeah.
[3:40:43] <%Frost_Quill> The voice acting by the MC has grown on me, I actually kinda like it now.
[3:40:43] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> "You got the DUD!"
[3:40:45] <elicoy> No...lol
[3:40:52] <PleaseCallMeSugar> black and white was probably the most effort they will ever put into a pokemon game
[3:40:54] <%ExpressNode> But others I don't see that lvl of detail
[3:41:07] <OneThousandTomatoes> pokemon does do new things but its usually not enough to satisfy people
[3:41:28] <PleaseCallMeSugar> most of the new stuff is to drive merchandising lmao
[3:41:43] <cacophanes> and then they take it out lmao
[3:41:46] <Zourath> Pokemon does the World of Warcraft "innovation". I.E. it adds a new big major gimmick every iteration that promptly gets abandoned next iteration.
[3:41:46] <OneThousandTomatoes> not exactly
[3:41:48] <%Frost_Quill> They do new things and then completely drop it and replace it with something else the next game.
[3:41:49] <+TopTieramisu> i mean, pokemon introduces new mechanics that it removes in the next title
[3:41:50] <PleaseCallMeSugar> remember how megas, z-moves, AND gigantimaxing all leaked through toy sales?
[3:41:58] <Slim_Lipid> most of pokemon's QoL stuff is intended for the metagame
[3:42:03] <+TopTieramisu> @Zourath or the paper mario
[3:42:16] <susukouhai> a burning rathian feels wrong
[3:42:27] <%Frost_Quill> What Nintendo did to Paper Mario is a crime.
[3:42:54] <%UltraViolet371> this armor set and sword are so damn nice
[3:43:00] <PleaseCallMeSugar> everyone responsible for what was done to paper mario should be tried at the hague
[3:43:05] <elicoy> I enjoyed the phone call re-battles in Gold, and Ruby had the Pokemon contests. Those were fun. I can't remember much after Ruby
[3:43:23] <%Frost_Quill> "That's one."
[3:43:27] <$Jigokuro> "That's one"
[3:43:29] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> context sensitive voices, nice
[3:43:30] <%ExpressNode> Nintendo always seems to take a foot forward for some of their titles and 2 steps back for a lot of others
[3:43:38] <PleaseCallMeSugar> that's a really nice bit of attention to detail actually
[3:43:41] <%Frost_Quill> The voice lines aren't as annoying as I was afraid they'd be.
[3:43:46] <AllenDeadman> do gathering hub quests in this game advance the story?
[3:44:04] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> THE MIXUP
[3:44:05] <OneThousandTomatoes> big
[3:44:08] <%kujofire990> WHIFF CITY
[3:44:11] <PleaseCallMeSugar> nintendo making a new zelda game uses up literally all the innovation they're capable of for 5 to 10 years
[3:44:14] <halfmasks> "huh i thought i heard the sound of a BITCH
[3:44:16] <%UltraViolet371> lmao
[3:44:17] <%HaloPlayerNamedJohn> It would be nice to hear other monster hunters talk but not your own as an option
[3:44:21] <Zourath> To be fair, Pokemon is not Nintendo. Which is honestly part of the problem.
[3:44:47] <+TheBitingIrish> @HaloPlayerNamedJohn That IS an option
[3:44:52] <Zourath> That rights clusterfuck is a mess.
[3:44:55] <PleaseCallMeSugar> honestly? I don't want Pokemon to be Nintendo, I want Nintendo and The Pokemon Company to stop treating Game Freak like slaves
[3:44:57] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> that silkbind attack seems very handy
[3:45:16] <+TheBitingIrish> You can set your own voice lines to 0% and leave on other players'
[3:45:19] <%HaloPlayerNamedJohn> @TheBitingIrish Oh shit really?
[3:45:25] <%ExpressNode> I think Pokemon is kind of a second party studio right?
[3:45:38] <%ExpressNode> Some rights but not all of them?
[3:45:46] <%Artemis_Scowl> Naw just two flips!
[3:45:48] <+Veraverse> There's a instrument in this OST that's reminding me of Okami so much
[3:45:56] <+Veraverse> Same notes, too
[3:46:02] <%HaloPlayerNamedJohn> @TheBitingIrish Thats great, I like having callouts by npcs its like Halo 5 multiplayer
[3:46:03] <PleaseCallMeSugar> game freak is this weird second party shared between nintendo and the pokemon company, and funded Only Enough To Get The Next Game Out
[3:46:03] <+TheBitingIrish> Didn't Nintendo fully acquire Game Freak recently?
[3:46:03] <halfmasks> @ExpressNode i would say its all rights to GameFreak and The Pokemon Company
[3:46:04] <TrollKing96> @PatStaresAt Which is easier, Rathian or Rathalos?
[3:46:15] <%UltraViolet371> ofc she chooses to do the dive when it would hurt the most
[3:46:24] <PleaseCallMeSugar> rathian without a doubt
[3:46:30] <elicoy> I just noticed Pat's blade. It looks radical
[3:46:33] <PleaseCallMeSugar> los has built-in bullshit
[3:46:34] <MittensBroadcast> thats a funny visual
[3:46:37] <elicoy> What is it?
[3:46:41] <Flakari> Did Rathian always poison on her flip after her tail is severed?
[3:46:46] <rReizs> remember rathalos' world tour around forest and hills
[3:46:48] <+wizard_of_diamonds> This game almost makes me want to buy a Switch. ALMOST.
[3:46:50] <PleaseCallMeSugar> pat's using the aknosom set
[3:47:05] <OneThousandTomatoes> @flakari ye
[3:47:06] <%kujofire990> @PatStaresAt how do you like the new monsters?
[3:47:08] <wolfen091> yes she still poisoned
[3:47:13] <PleaseCallMeSugar> wait for a PC port or a Switch Pro
[3:47:15] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Nice
[3:47:20] <%hrbeck_> I'm really close to considering a switch myself
[3:47:36] <+wizard_of_diamonds> @PleaseCallMeSugar Fair enough
[3:47:37] <halfmasks> @TheBitingIrish im not full sure but the nintendo controls the brand not the actual game development
[3:47:39] <APsaull> palico just straight up lets you know its capturable. thats nice
[3:47:39] <Sol_Install> Pat looks like an armor chicken
[3:47:39] <%extradopeness> i bought my copy after work today. taking a break right now
[3:47:40] <elicoy> @PleaseCallMeSugar Why do you say?
[3:47:44] <+Zeeph0n> @PleaseCallMeSugar pc port is in 2022 tho
[3:47:47] <+Veraverse> Still waiting on the Switch Pro
[3:47:53] <+Zeeph0n> that's gonna take a while
[3:47:54] <%ExpressNode> I might just wait for PC port.  Didn't get console version of MH World so I can do the wait
[3:48:11] <Flakari> @OneThousandTomatoes Weird, I never encountered that before, good to know
[3:48:12] <OneThousandTomatoes> do you think the switch pro will be called the switch pro?
[3:48:12] <+wizard_of_diamonds> @Zeeph0n I waited until at least a year after the MHW PC release LUL
[3:48:26] <PleaseCallMeSugar> the PC port is guaranteed early 2022, and a Switch With Better Hardware is very likely to happen soon as well
[3:48:31] <halfmasks> this game is gonna be wild on pc
[3:48:32] <%kujofire990> look at that birb
[3:48:36] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> cute berd
[3:48:36] <+Veraverse> The Switch Pro will be called Switched
[3:48:44] <elicoy> The Switch Go
[3:48:44] <%Puhff> OWL?!
[3:48:47] <sweettalker_> Are ya playin MonHun, son?
[3:48:48] <+Opal_Overture> OWL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[3:48:49] <%extradopeness> its gonna be called the new switch u & knuckles
[3:48:51] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Thanks for reminding me its worth to wait, either for PC or possibly better Switch
[3:48:52] <%Puhff> woolieYE
[3:48:54] <PleaseCallMeSugar> they'll probably call it something stupid like the Switch Deluxe
[3:48:56] <Devbob98> I’d die for that owl
[3:49:03] <ItsJustShawn> why are people leaving chicken nuggets in the sun
[3:49:03] <OneThousandTomatoes> I think Switch Plus is possible
[3:49:03] <%ExpressNode> "New" Nintendo Switch Kappa
[3:49:05] <%walternatorz> i like chicken nuggets
[3:49:07] <%UltraViolet371> yay it doesn't ask you if you're sure about taking all the items
[3:49:07] <+silverfox361> the New Nintendo Switch
[3:49:09] <Blank9> I really hope we don't get the switch pro and just get a new console with backwards compatibility
[3:49:10] <%hrbeck_> New Switch XL
[3:49:11] <PleaseCallMeSugar> oh my god the baby tetsu's buck teeth
[3:49:13] <Zourath> Swiitch.
[3:49:20] <+Zeeph0n> @wizard_of_diamonds didn't feel that long for world tho, maybe cos' at the time i got off the Monster Hunter hypetrain
[3:49:22] <halfmasks> look at that baby tetsu cabra
[3:49:28] <PleaseCallMeSugar> New Nintendo Switch Lite XL
[3:49:29] <+Veraverse> Cute waifu
[3:49:30] <TheRealNumberJ42> 2witch
[3:49:33] <%barrakuta371> SwitchU
[3:49:35] <DublinRage> what kind of Palico is Elmo? Healing or Support?
[3:49:35] <+Zeeph0n> now it's going full steam =(
[3:49:35] <%hrbeck_> IS THAT A BABBY TESTUCABRA!?
[3:49:47] <+Opal_Overture> @Puhff waynerOo waynerOo waynerOo waynerOo waynerOo waynerOo waynerOo
[3:49:47] <%extradopeness> SwIItch would be really stupid and i kinda love it
[3:49:48] <iq_dropper> Will the controller be called the Switch Pro Pro Controller?
[3:49:59] <slimslimjim88> Stolen and eaten by the homeless?
[3:50:02] <+OhioNitsud> did you guys hear about the under night port that's coming to the Switch? It's going to be called Switched At Birth Kappa
[3:50:10] <+Zeeph0n> @extradopeness sWiitch U
[3:50:13] <OneThousandTomatoes> swIItch is great i hate it
[3:50:16] <+wizard_of_diamonds> @Zeeph0n Fair enough. I've been PC-only for decades so I've gotten so jaded to PC ports I was willing to wait, especially as first news of the PC port for MHW was bad
[3:50:16] <%ExpressNode> Hopefully they will add more colors to the Pro Controller
[3:50:26] <%BioHunter> BioHunter subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 19 months! 
[3:50:32] <%hrbeck_> look at babby tetsu
[3:50:35] <Mattais88> Oh is that why there's two differnt quest sets?
[3:50:39] <%UltraViolet371> TOBI <3
[3:50:51] <%UltraViolet371> what a good squirrel thing
[3:50:51] <PleaseCallMeSugar> tobi c:
[3:50:58] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> somnacanth looks like tobi's weird cousin
[3:50:59] <elicoy> I think Tobi is cool
[3:51:06] <%extradopeness> sleppy boi
[3:51:06] <+Zeeph0n> @wizard_of_diamonds it's still kinda bad IMO, but i blame it on the engine
[3:51:09] <sweettalker_> the dog knows he is the master of the house
[3:51:12] <%ExpressNode> He owns that room now
[3:51:13] <ergulor> is kinda weird that the tetsucabra is not part of the monster list but a baby one is here.
[3:51:15] <elicoy> He's presenting
[3:51:16] <$RealThiele> doggy codpiece
[3:51:20] <OneThousandTomatoes> mh team usually get things right the second time around so I think the pc port will be better than the mhw one
[3:51:20] <PinoProxie> he might aswell flaunt them while he has them
[3:51:28] <+rbakervv> Zangrief stil has his balls?
[3:51:31] <%hrbeck_> gib babby tetsu
[3:51:32] <+OhioNitsud> jesus christ pat. put some pants on that kid
[3:51:34] <Devbob98> He knows they’ll be gone soon
[3:51:38] <%rumtumtugnutz> PatStaresAt Gief's Shlang
[3:51:41] <notsoy> how much longer until the snip
[3:51:43] <%MisterRockett> Ayyyyyye Tobi is back
[3:51:43] <penitentpendant> Look, it's Not-A-Tobi
[3:51:47] <elicoy> @rbakervv For now
[3:51:52] <%Ranryu692> it's probably just a recap episode, but apparently My Hero Academia is back tomorrow >.>
[3:51:52] <ミュウレ4242> kurosawa vision, but not b&w. weird.
[3:51:54] <OneThousandTomatoes> it looks cooler somehow
[3:51:54] <%MisterRockett> Which means Viper Tobi is DEF here too.
[3:51:54] <%hrbeck_> bulldogs wait longer to get fixed because of their fucked up bones
[3:51:55] <cacophanes> It's a flying squirrel calm down narrator
[3:51:59] <ergulor> mr Tobi fox
[3:52:01] <+Zeeph0n> these intros are almost comical in japanese
[3:52:09] <sweettalker_> why doesn't it play the japanese "YOOOO" sound effect.
[3:52:25] <PleaseCallMeSugar> that'll probably be the very first mod on PC
[3:52:26] <+Opal_Overture> @penitentpendant Oh really?
[3:52:27] <%Frost_Quill> YOOOOOooooo
[3:52:30] <elicoy> @Ranryu692 First i've heard. Thanks for the heads up
[3:52:33] <Devbob98> Look at this bullshit, it’s like nature put it on randomizer
[3:52:34] <T_Sasquatch> its ya boi tobyyyyy
[3:52:35] <%MisterRockett> Bait that makes the monster SUPER slutty and show you their tits.
[3:52:36] <OneThousandTomatoes> @troubadour2 because its supposed to be a ghost story not kabuki
[3:52:44] <%extradopeness> i legit cant play this in anything but jp
[3:52:54] <%hrbeck_> fish titty, fitties
[3:52:54] <+Opal_Overture> @MisterRockett BACK TO HORNY JAIL
[3:52:57] <%extradopeness> its too funny
[3:53:00] <PleaseCallMeSugar> bait that turns the monsters into those cursed rule 34 gijinkas
[3:53:12] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> tobi looks weird in a swamp environment
[3:53:16] <PleaseCallMeSugar> WOAH tobi's pissed
[3:53:19] <%MisterRockett> @MisterRockett You'll have to CATCH ME FIRST
[3:53:26] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @PleaseCallMeSugar you mean blessed
[3:53:37] <PleaseCallMeSugar> ONLY if they're buff
[3:53:39] <+Opal_Overture> Tobi "Radiation" Kadachi
[3:53:42] <huskarl_zap> Isnt that the satan dog from the flesh pits of hell?
[3:53:47] <+Zeeph0n> WTF it has some G-Rank moves
[3:53:53] <OneThousandTomatoes> youre gonna have to catch yourself?
[3:54:00] <PleaseCallMeSugar> @Opal_Overture LUL
[3:54:03] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @huskarl_zap that's another mon
[3:54:05] <WeebFever> Tobi got beefed up in this game, struggled with him more than Narg
[3:54:06] <+TheBitingIrish> Gijinkas??? 👀
[3:54:26] <+TheBitingIrish> Tobi looks ripped D:
[3:54:36] <%UltraViolet371> are those Viper moves on normal Tobi?
[3:54:42] <%Frost_Quill> Yeah I always put on armor with the draw skill when I fight Tobi with the greatsword, I'm not good at landing the charge attacks on him.
[3:54:51] <%MisterRockett> I saw a big tittied Bazzelgoose bullying a tiny Kulu girl and since my mind has not known peace.
[3:54:58] <OneThousandTomatoes> LUL
[3:55:06] <PleaseCallMeSugar> it do be like that
[3:55:16] <huskarl_zap> @KosOrSomeSayKosm_ a recolor?
[3:55:18] <+Zeeph0n> this freaking theme is too close to divine bloodline for Castlevania
[3:55:28] <+Zeeph0n> from*
[3:55:29] <elicoy> @MisterRockett Stop, Plague will hear you
[3:55:32] <sweettalker_> BYE
[3:55:34] <+DuppyConQR> byeeeee!~
[3:55:37] <OneThousandTomatoes> @misterrockett gaijinMHRise BOP
[3:55:40] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @huskarl_zap nooo, tobi and odogaron are completely different
[3:55:49] <T_Sasquatch> I remember in base world, Tobi was a wall for me LUL
[3:55:51] <cacophanes> wait did the hunter say bye to the wroggi? That's adorable
[3:55:52] <PleaseCallMeSugar> we need to get Plague into Monster Hunter so he'll draw buff monster girls
[3:55:55] <%Ranryu692> @MisterRockett keep going, Plague will hear you
[3:56:02] <%Frost_Quill> @elicoy Good, maybe it'll get Plague interested in the series.
[3:56:16] <OldPaleDrake> wow they really dumbed down tobi's moveset
[3:56:31] <%Landralin1996> TOBI!!! <3
[3:56:36] <sweettalker_> Now we are all... the Monster Hunter
[3:56:46] <%Monkeyweed21> @OldPaleDrake this is low rank every monster has a limited moveset here
[3:56:50] <%ExpressNode> So I heard some controversy over that Balan Wonder World game. What's that about?
[3:56:51] <OneThousandTomatoes> i think it's more like it doesn't have the trees to bounce off
[3:56:52] <PleaseCallMeSugar> tobi keep doing your best, we love you
[3:57:04] <elicoy> Of all things he should certainly have an interest in a game called MONSTER HUNTER
[3:57:05] <Zombrocom> This is low rank tobi
[3:57:14] <+Zeeph0n> nice remobras are back
[3:57:47] <%MisterRockett> @OldPaleDrake This might just be his First rank and you're used to playing the G Rank version. Remember they sometimes get new moves.
[3:57:48] <T_Sasquatch> WHIFFF CITY PogChamp
[3:57:52] <%Monkeyweed21> oh cool they gave Tobi his variants projectiles
[3:57:56] <PleaseCallMeSugar> if Plague had more interest in animation, you could totally get him to play exclusively to watch the way monsters move, and we could get a spiritual successor to the video where he just stares at a pile of bricks
[3:58:06] <OldPaleDrake> @Monkeyweed21 i aware, i dont remember low rank tobi standing still this much in world
[3:58:11] <%hrbeck_> Plague: Oh, man! Monster Hunter! *doesn't see a monster tiddy in 5 minutes* *puts it away* :(
[3:58:12] <+Watterx> same
[3:58:15] <AllenDeadman> understandable
[3:58:18] <Dannzzyy> My copy didn’t arrive today but the stream puts me at ease. Thanks pat.
[3:58:27] <+TheBitingIrish> @ExpressNode I haven't heard about any controversy other than it's lame
[3:58:30] <APsaull> Tobi is sort of a bastard. In Iceborne Viper Tobi really messed me up
[3:58:37] <AllenDeadman> he is fast, and he was a completely new monster
[3:58:37] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> guys plague already played world, but he wasn't really a fan
[3:58:39] <%UltraViolet371> it was like putting zinogre-lite in the early game
[3:58:42] <PleaseCallMeSugar> @hrbeck_ all he has to do is play as a woman and he'll never escape the boobs
[3:58:44] <AllenDeadman> it almost carted me
[3:58:44] <$Jigokuro> Huh, I kicked the shit out of it, iirc... Now I'm trying to remember what did me in first... Hmm.
[3:58:49] <luciluxlu0> found it
[3:58:58] <T_Sasquatch> I had an easier time with anjanath than tobi lmao
[3:58:59] <%Monkeyweed21> man Viper Tobi is some bullshit its great
[3:59:05] <+Zeeph0n> @OldPaleDrake it seems like it can't climb the enviroment anymore, but it has some master rank moves
[3:59:07] <OneThousandTomatoes> balan is lame, and it caused seizures, but that was patched day one
[3:59:14] <%ExpressNode> @TheBitingIrish I thought I heard it had some seizure inducing thing in it
[3:59:16] <+Zeeph0n> and some from viper kadachi as well
[3:59:24] <%hrbeck_> @hrbeck_ not the same :(
[3:59:52] <%Frost_Quill> I haven't carted yet in World (outside of multiplayer but that was other people fainting) and I've beaten 2 of the 3 elder dragons you gotta fight for the story.
[3:59:54] <+TheBitingIrish> @ExpressNode Oh fuck, that's right! Apparently there's a bug with the final boss that makes it rapid fire a certain attack
[3:59:56] <%Wydamn> hyperarmor on cooldown? As in, you need to dodge AFTER getting attacked?
[4:00:19] <PleaseCallMeSugar> man what is it with games causing seizures lately
[4:00:30] <T_Sasquatch> pretty sure I've carted to every monster in world atleast once LUL
[4:00:42] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @Frost_Quill oh don't worry you'll get there
[4:00:48] <%ExpressNode> @TheBitingIrish Fuck thats jank.  Glad I avoided that.
[4:00:53] <PleaseCallMeSugar> I think my first cart in World was against Nerg
[4:01:20] <cacophanes> Bullfango squad lesssgo
[4:01:35] <%Frost_Quill> @KosOrSomeSayKosm_ LR Wait I think I misunderstood something lol, I've carted to stuff I haven't failed a hunt yet.  Lol oops.
[4:01:36] <%hrbeck_> first cart in world was Anjanath- I suffer against big rushdown monsters
[4:01:51] <OneThousandTomatoes> I played the balan demo before it came out, it plays and looks like a wii game
[4:01:53] <T_Sasquatch> now I ride the monsters !
[4:02:02] <%Monkeyweed21> PICK UP THE MATERIAL
[4:02:02] <Dannzzyy> Hopefully this game will do some cool Nintendo in event missions.
[4:02:04] <%MisterRockett> I still want ONE Monster that's humanoid.
[4:02:09] <PleaseCallMeSugar> I specifically remember that my first cart in Gen was Poison Ludroth
[4:02:10] <Slim_Lipid> how do i fight pink t-rex :(
[4:02:15] <elicoy> @PatStaresAt What monster have you EVER had the most trouble with?
[4:02:15] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @Frost_Quill oh, yeah then that makes a bit more sense
[4:02:20] <OneThousandTomatoes> @misterrockett rajang?
[4:02:27] <%hrbeck_> And he LOVED hallways
[4:02:29] <T_Sasquatch> @MisterRockett r a j a n g
[4:02:33] <OneThousandTomatoes> probably as close as youll get
[4:02:34] <%Wydamn> lol that wheezing in the background
[4:02:38] <Evendrag> also, firebreath onesghot
[4:02:39] <%Monkeyweed21> Anja is way better in master rank
[4:02:40] <%MisterRockett> @Dannzzyy I played GenX with a friend a while back and we had so much fucking fun just gathering all the dumb event stuff for out Palicos.
[4:02:42] <%MisterRockett> No
[4:02:44] <+TheBitingIrish> A humanoid monster would be, like, the final boss of the final game
[4:02:44] <%MisterRockett> Not him
[4:02:44] <jon651> Tobi in World gave me trouble the first time. the fucker would not stop climbing the trees!
[4:02:49] <%MisterRockett> Goddamnit.
[4:02:54] <%Monkeyweed21> he actually uses his mucus and fire breath
[4:03:04] <%MisterRockett> Primates don't count they just fight like primates!
[4:03:10] <Dannzzyy> @misterrockett hell yea.
[4:03:14] <%Frost_Quill> What does Tobi armor look like on dog?
[4:03:15] <PleaseCallMeSugar> monke
[4:03:19] <blackbookalpha> touch the ERB
[4:03:22] <%MisterRockett> I want a monster that does Hunter moves.
[4:03:24] <elicoy> Frostfang Barioth was my bane
[4:03:29] <PleaseCallMeSugar> show us doggo tobi armor please
[4:03:34] <+Opal_Overture> "Humanoid Monster"  Just have you fight poachers, smh.
[4:03:45] <rosabellamelantha> Reminder that Wyvernians are just wyverns that happened to evolve into humanoids like humans evolved from monke
[4:03:48] <OneThousandTomatoes> do you want to fight His Immensness, a wyverian bigger 125% rajang's height?
[4:03:50] <%MisterRockett> I want them to be big tho
[4:03:54] <rosabellamelantha> so technically if you ever fought a wyvernian
[4:03:57] <PleaseCallMeSugar> armor, pat
[4:03:58] <rosabellamelantha> that'd count
[4:03:59] <%MisterRockett> I want Dark Souls bosses, basically.
[4:04:12] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> I dunno, humanoid monster doesn't really fit the mh mood
[4:04:13] <blackbookalpha> gacha time
[4:04:15] <T_Sasquatch> I remember my walls in world were tobi , teostra and deviljho
[4:04:16] <%MisterRockett> Give me Tower Knight
[4:04:33] <%MisterRockett> @KosOrSomeSayKosm_ They can afford ONE
[4:04:37] <PleaseCallMeSugar> if they used the Leshen skeleton, or did more monsters like Goss Harag, that would be awesome
[4:04:43] <rosabellamelantha> MH world doesn't have much if any internal conflict
[4:04:51] <rosabellamelantha> everyone is too busy not dying to monsters
[4:04:52] <T_Sasquatch> leshen was ass
[4:04:54] <+akaJackpot> These load times holy shit
[4:04:57] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @KosOrSomeSayKosm_ eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeh
[4:04:57] <notsoy> you think using ranged weapons solo is actually workable with the improved pals?
[4:05:02] <rosabellamelantha> human enemies would be out of place for the setting
[4:05:08] <+Opal_Overture> Monster Hunter, but if you farm a specific type of monster too much, you get put on a "Poachers" list and get Dark Souls style invaded.
[4:05:18] <rosabellamelantha> the closest uou get is riders
[4:05:26] <%Monkeyweed21> boy does he
[4:05:27] <%MisterRockett> @rosabellamelantha I did not say human enemies. I said I want human shaped monsters.
[4:05:28] <+TheBitingIrish> A squid elder dragon that pilots an old set of armor of His Immensness'
[4:05:29] <Zourath> Could probably get away with a knight-themed ape of some kind.
[4:05:42] <%BoxNavy> hes cool
[4:05:45] <jon651> to I armor for Palamute :(
[4:05:48] <rosabellamelantha> but that's more them going "you shouldn't try and make friends with monsters they're the worst"
[4:05:50] <%baka_sugoi> water bat
[4:05:51] <jon651> *tobi
[4:05:53] <%Ynkubus_> The human vs human conflict is all in the background, the Guild has you doing better things
[4:05:57] <+Erictron4000> What armor are you using?
[4:05:58] <blackbookalpha> watch out for his chest nut cracking
[4:06:02] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> underwater is back guys, look
[4:06:03] <KaiserMario> A strangely attractive fish monster
[4:06:04] <%MisterRockett> Hope you got anti-sleep
[4:06:06] <Sol_Install> dumb
[4:06:07] <%BoxNavy> thats crazy
[4:06:08] <OneThousandTomatoes> WHAT
[4:06:17] <%BoxNavy> also its a water monster that isnt obnoxious :O
[4:06:17] <iosephe> Don't get sleeplocked
[4:06:22] <+TheBitingIrish> A good old Siren
[4:06:22] <%MisterRockett> @KaiserMario Still ain't got nothing on Mitzu.
[4:06:24] <WeebFever> Ugly catfish monster
[4:06:24] <fusedforms> "dulcet" huh?
[4:06:24] <s1rcuit> does the game do this every hunt, or just new monsters?
[4:06:26] <TheRealNumberJ42> freaky
[4:06:27] <%toastybites> is that a flying fish with legs
[4:06:28] <blackbookalpha> PlagueOfGripes ready
[4:06:28] <+Opal_Overture> ....
[4:06:29] <luciluxlu0> randal
[4:06:31] <%Monkeyweed21> yea like Plesioth
[4:06:33] <%baka_sugoi> EEL
[4:06:35] <OneThousandTomatoes> yokai?
[4:06:36] <AllenDeadman> Youkai
[4:06:38] <rosabellamelantha> That was the dark souls hollow scream
[4:06:40] <AllenDeadman> Yokai*
[4:06:40] <elicoy> Its kinda cool i think
[4:06:41] <PleaseCallMeSugar> they're based on yokai and it's awesome
[4:06:44] <$Afterman_> that's the point ye
[4:06:44] <Kaiser_Ko> Yeah, for sure
[4:06:44] <%Frost_Quill> Youkai
[4:06:45] <AllenDeadman> yeah that's the theme
[4:06:45] <%Ynkubus_> Thats the pont
[4:06:46] <Zombrocom> They're yokai
[4:06:48] <Man_in_the_Red> gee i wonder why
[4:06:48] <rosabellamelantha> that was straight up a hollow scream
[4:06:49] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt think you mean Kaiju
[4:06:50] <Sol_Install> all the new monsters are based off yokai
[4:06:52] <%toastybites> hot
[4:06:53] <Varanoo> It's like Bishaten
[4:06:56] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> I think that one's based on the long haired female headed yokai
[4:06:57] <%ExpressNode> Brokai
[4:06:58] <%Broand> All of them are based on yokai, even great izuchi
[4:07:01] <+cahv123> They seem to be going for that asthetic. It's all very feudal japan.
[4:07:02] <+Shoosler> yokai? I'm watching
[4:07:05] <akitanito> monster hunter x yokai watch collab
[4:07:06] <Sol_Install> kaiju != yokai
[4:07:07] <%LeiaSkynoober> Is that anything like Yokai Watch?
[4:07:09] <PleaseCallMeSugar> MOST of the new monsters are based off of yokai
[4:07:13] <jorniev> FOLK beasts
[4:07:14] <+TheBitingIrish> What's the ice bear?
[4:07:15] <PleaseCallMeSugar> they said a few aren't
[4:07:25] <Zombrocom> Rampage in japanese is something like Night Parade of Demons
[4:07:29] <%Frost_Quill> When's the monster that has an eyeball in it's ass and it looks at you?  That's a youkai look it up.
[4:07:33] <PleaseCallMeSugar> goss harag is a reference to red oni blue oni
[4:07:33] <+Opal_Overture> omg, theyre so small
[4:07:35] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> I watch Pat because he is so humble he makes other streamers look stupid.
[4:07:35] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @TheBitingIrish an oni
[4:07:38] <%MisterRockett> Alright yall, level with me. Is Mizutsune the hottest monster in the series?
[4:07:41] <jorniev> i like it
[4:07:43] <+TheBitingIrish> oh lul
[4:07:47] <T_Sasquatch> kinda cute tbh
[4:07:50] <blackbookalpha> mermaid girl yokai

[4:07:53] <%GinAndRoses> this guys cool
[4:07:54] <Zombrocom> The ice bear is a Namahage, to be exact
[4:07:56] <krin_x> these monster intros give a lot of flavor to the game
[4:07:57] <rosabellamelantha> Mizutsune is male
[4:07:59] <jorniev> it has a drum on its belly?
[4:08:07] <+Gespens> BLASTBLIGHT?
[4:08:08] <akitanito> that's an otter move lol
[4:08:08] <PleaseCallMeSugar> EXCUSE ME WHAT
[4:08:10] <Sol_Install> ok
[4:08:10] <%toastybites> hit its bewbs
[4:08:11] <rosabellamelantha> all brightly coloured mizu are male
[4:08:11] <blackbookalpha> Blast, Flash and Heal
[4:08:12] <Sol_Install> that's new to me
[4:08:12] <WeebFever> He cracks exploding/flash oysters on his tummy
[4:08:13] <AllenDeadman> WHAT?
[4:08:16] <ergulor> weird i was thinking sleep
[4:08:17] <WeebFever> The gas does sleep
[4:08:17] <%Frost_Quill> This thing looks cool, it's armor probably looks cool.
[4:08:18] <jorniev> IT HAS A DRUM on its belly
[4:08:18] <T_Sasquatch> dont kill it misuCri misuCri misuCri
[4:08:18] <%czeekytv> Deodorant???
[4:08:19] <HeroToxiko> YEAH BOIII

[4:08:24] <%MisterRockett> @rosabellamelantha What's your point?
[4:08:29] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> blast and sleep? now YOU ARE GETTING SLEEPBOMBED
[4:08:38] <blackbookalpha> Has 3 types if I remember: Blast, Flash and Healing nuts
[4:08:45] <rosabellamelantha> Just making sure
[4:08:47] <PleaseCallMeSugar> sleepbomb monster
[4:08:50] <WeebFever> It's an otter mermaid catfish with a taiko drum chest, by the by
[4:09:06] <AllenDeadman> AYY BARIOTH
[4:09:07] <$Jigokuro> Monsters note being one-note? No fair! clempsAngry
[4:09:13] <rosabellamelantha> the hottest monster is Teostra
[4:09:18] <rosabellamelantha> lmao
[4:09:20] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Barrioth can suck my nuts. Damn I hate that guy
[4:09:36] <PleaseCallMeSugar> barioth was my second ever wall, fuck that thing
[4:09:40] <T_Sasquatch> barioth is the only monster in iceborne i carted to in the main story
[4:09:42] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> it's tobi, but weird
[4:09:44] <s1rcuit> said the little man
[4:09:45] <%toastybites> is this east vs west
[4:09:45] <rosabellamelantha> wait no
[4:09:53] <rosabellamelantha> nuclear brachy]
[4:09:56] <%MisterRockett> @rosabellamelantha Only if you install the cock and balls mod off Nexus.
[4:10:01] <%Frost_Quill> There are monsters that are basically the same size as you.  The camera flash lizard from World as an example.
[4:10:06] <Evendrag> sharingan stomach
[4:10:21] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Barioth isn't even that hard he's just so frustrating to fight. Even both his forelegs broken he still sails across half the map with each attack
[4:10:38] <blackbookalpha> if it cracks a healing shell, you can heal using its AoE
[4:10:46] <Evendrag> it has a sleep sweep... wow...
[4:10:47] <PleaseCallMeSugar> barioth hunts be like: [running in the 90s begins to play]
[4:10:51] <$scallycap> nice
[4:10:56] <iosephe> nice
[4:11:07] <leinadtonu> ha, you bonked that monster!
[4:11:07] <T_Sasquatch> 69
[4:11:10] <%toastybites> @wizard_of_diamonds i dont remember if normal barioth had it but frostfang's freeze and slam combo was rly annoying
[4:11:13] <blackbookalpha> yep
[4:11:13] <PleaseCallMeSugar> excuse me what
[4:11:20] <PleaseCallMeSugar> excuse me WHAT
[4:11:20] <blackbookalpha> Blast, Flash, and Heal
[4:11:22] <akitanito> I think that's from the mob
[4:11:25] <WeebFever> The clams it smashes on its chest all have different effects
[4:11:35] <Man_in_the_Red> Gypseros 2.0
[4:11:37] <+Gespens> I have a feeling that the spines might even poison at this point
[4:11:39] <blackbookalpha> It cracks shells on its chest
[4:11:43] <Zombrocom> It collects flash pods and blast pods and smashes them against its chest
[4:11:47] <LockingKey> status monster
[4:11:47] <PleaseCallMeSugar> this thing is nuts
[4:11:48] <+Xalgar> More moves than a Pomemon
[4:12:01] <Manwad> If there's a bowgun that can be made from that, I bet it's just all the status 2 shots
[4:12:15] <+DukeBlack_> she  slugged his ass
[4:12:20] <%Monkeyweed21> why no kill? @PatStaresAt
[4:12:25] <PleaseCallMeSugar> I really wanna see the armor and equipment from this thing
[4:12:33] <Sol_Install> Like how is it underwater there?
[4:12:37] <%Frost_Quill> @Monkeyweed21 Capture gives more rewards.
[4:12:45] <%MisterRockett> @Manwad Eeeh in my experience it's always disappointingly few but here's hoping.
[4:12:48] <AllenDeadman> IS IT A LIZZARD OTTER?
[4:12:57] <Evendrag> oh it picks up a shell
[4:13:00] <PleaseCallMeSugar> OUTPLAYED
[4:13:01] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> LUL
[4:13:06] <Zombrocom> Lizard fish otter mermaid dragon yes
[4:13:09] <T_Sasquatch> looooooooooooooooooooool
[4:13:10] <%hrbeck_> Thanks, i hate it
[4:13:20] <iosephe> Beaten at its own game
[4:13:21] <Arteza147> opinion vs world so far?
[4:13:23] <%Ynkubus_> The armours great
[4:13:23] <T_Sasquatch> pretty cool !
[4:13:24] <WeebFever> You get stinky slime rogue armor
[4:13:24] <blackbookalpha> its the Dual Blades from the demo
[4:13:25] <rabidclone> it's a new pickle
[4:13:26] <ergulor> a veil most likely
[4:13:28] <VenGE1111> how has the frame rate held up so far @patstaresat and chat
[4:13:28] <%BoxNavy> you love it
[4:13:29] <T_Sasquatch> no its CUTE
[4:13:30] <$Afterman_> it was the db armor in demo
[4:13:30] <+Gespens> It's a fucking Giant River Otter and but scaly I love it
[4:13:32] <OneThousandTomatoes> eat its flesh, youll gain immortality
[4:13:32] <KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt Not sure you know, but this monster type can be knock down when they stand on their tails, I think that breath attack is good moment to hit them
[4:13:32] <luciluxlu0> hawt
[4:13:34] <blackbookalpha> Dual Blade Armor from the demo
[4:13:35] <%BoxNavy> :)
[4:13:35] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> the yokai it's based on is also kinda gross so makes sense
[4:13:35] <Mattais88> birb
[4:13:37] <dan_g_v> beautiful
[4:13:38] <%Frost_Quill> More importantly what will it's armor look like on your cat and dog.
[4:13:39] <$Jigokuro> decent
[4:13:40] <Evendrag> deep sea shit
[4:13:41] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> he's cute
[4:13:43] <antimatter_man> Ninja gear
[4:13:44] <PleaseCallMeSugar> looks like an absolutely solid 30
[4:13:46] <OneThousandTomatoes> 30 stable
[4:13:46] <%BoxNavy> it dips to 1 fps all the time dude
[4:13:49] <%baka_sugoi> good
[4:13:51] <PleaseCallMeSugar> permanent 30 fps, no drops
[4:13:54] <%GinAndRoses> rock solid bb
[4:13:59] <iosephe> It's great but the distant flying small monsters are 5 FPS
[4:14:01] <+Watterx> pretty good, rare dips
[4:14:09] <VenGE1111> fuck I may wait for that switch pro then..
[4:14:12] <rabidclone> I've been surprised that this game doesn't scale down to 360p
[4:14:14] <antimatter_man> A pretty solid 120
[4:14:20] <PleaseCallMeSugar> apparently it's rare to get it to dip in rampages
[4:14:23] <peyodogo> it does the thing souls games do, where things out of focus drop down to like 2 fps to save resources
[4:14:25] <WeebFever> the game will END
[4:14:26] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> Kappa
[4:14:27] <OneThousandTomatoes> I'm gonna leave at the end on lr
[4:14:28] <VenGE1111> wait so it's good?
[4:14:30] <$RealThiele> (X)
[4:14:38] <EternalJedi> limesD FOR REAL!?
[4:14:38] <iosephe> (handheld, so maybe it's fine in console mode)
[4:14:39] <+Xalgar> Sad it's at 30 :(
[4:14:41] <%Puhff> Frames are fine but there seems to be awhite line on the bottom of the screen
[4:14:42] <dan_g_v> end of game, no more hunts. no sir
[4:14:43] <PleaseCallMeSugar> @peyodogo yeah but it's also distance-based
[4:14:49] <OneThousandTomatoes> cause i want to play that myself
[4:14:53] <PleaseCallMeSugar> do you can sometimes see creatures CHUGGING in the distance
[4:15:00] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> locked 30, like god intended
[4:15:08] <peyodogo> oh yeah for sure, it's great
[4:15:11] <$RealThiele> this game being 30 consistently is a minor miracle for the switch
[4:15:11] <%AzureGale> its time to end this ones and for all!
[4:15:26] <OneThousandTomatoes> @pleasecallmesugar i haven't noticed any
[4:15:29] <leinadtonu> such soothing music...
[4:15:37] <%Frost_Quill> Armor?
[4:15:38] <PleaseCallMeSugar> I played World at locked 30 because the game is about as well-optimized as. fuckin. something that's poorly optimized.
[4:15:41] <Oxybe> Oh my god, the palico Khezu armour is a nurse outfit with a tiny hat and a syringe!
[4:15:48] <fran031> Check the armor
[4:15:50] <%HRDSalami654> "Cinematic" 30.
[4:15:52] <penitentpendant> Magnamalo: "Fool... I was holding them back..."
[4:16:03] <jorniev> magna means big malo means bad
[4:16:18] <PleaseCallMeSugar> OOH
[4:16:19] <Zombrocom> Its pretty nice actually
[4:16:19] <luciluxlu0> bold move to end the game at low rank
[4:16:20] <%GinAndRoses> that's dope
[4:16:20] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> nice
[4:16:22] <ergulor> Ninjo
[4:16:24] <T_Sasquatch> THATS SICK
[4:16:24] <OneThousandTomatoes> weird

[4:16:46] <ergulor> Wizzardo
[4:16:51] <cosmicgoatee> I love that the elder dragons are getting just more and more ridiculous
[4:16:51] <OneThousandTomatoes> goggles
[4:16:57] <VenGE1111> @patstaresat also how does that pro controller feel playing thus compared to a ps4 controller that I'm used to. I've always hated switching control schemes and I'm pretty sure playing this handheld mode would suck ass
[4:17:02] <antimatter_man> Not bad
[4:17:04] <+tetraes> wait its the end already?
[4:17:05] <%HRDSalami654> Doggles.
[4:17:06] <jorniev> BIGBAD
[4:17:11] <luciluxlu0> 100% run
[4:17:16] <+OhioNitsud> mashna mallow
[4:17:20] <jorniev> MAGNA MEANS BIG MALO MEANS BAD
[4:17:24] <PleaseCallMeSugar> watch the plot twist be that magnamalo is actually just driving the Rampage against an even worse monster's hunting season or something
[4:17:24] <jorniev> BIG BAD
[4:17:25] <%Monkeyweed21> FINAL BOSS GUYS
[4:17:32] <rabidclone> marshmalo

[4:17:59] <%extradopeness> magnamalo mart

[4:18:06] <blackbookalpha> @PatStaresAt Btw if you get hellblight status you can sheathe your weapon and wirebug dash to get rid of it
[4:18:07] <%BoxNavy> tobi deserved it
[4:18:07] <ergulor> NO TOBI!
[4:18:08] <ToneBacas> ah yes, the thing that gave Pat an ass beating in the demo
[4:18:11] <Evendrag> now i want crispin freeman to do these voiceovers
[4:18:11] <T_Sasquatch> man they are relally pushing this asiaaa theme

[4:22:22] <butthurtdave> I hate how strong the HH is now and how it's made me abandon the Lance because of how boring Lance is and how little it's changed

[4:23:37] <Captain_Joe1911> tansy5Tuntun
[4:23:39] <VenGE1111> damn punished

[4:23:43] <%DaPlatinum98765> damn seeing this is making it real hard for me to wait for the pc version
[4:23:44] <bigtavious> nliFELL
[4:23:45] <derivedknight> How does it feel with the voices? Not to intrusive?
[4:23:49] <Zombrocom> This is a "Hunt"
[4:23:50] <OneThousandTomatoes> glorySip
[4:23:52] <Sol_Install> the ENG VAs for this game
[4:23:54] <Sol_Install> are like
[4:23:59] <Sol_Install> the best
[4:24:07] <%TheCallousKing> Dumped at camp with his shame
[4:24:07] <cholesteroid> Next time, Mr. StaresAt, next time
[4:24:08] <%NopeBadguy> Have you seen the Yakuza 6 mod that swaps the baby for a tiny Daigo
[4:24:11] <%Puhff> Big Mood
[4:24:14] <luciluxlu0> you won't get world record at this rate
[4:24:16] <rReizs> turned the frequency of voices down to 50 its not bad
[4:24:17] <blackbookalpha> @PatStaresAt you can knock Magnamalo down with its own hellblight
[4:24:18] <Sol_Install> I love it
[4:24:19] <T_Sasquatch> Is that dog drifting i see ? LUL
[4:24:23] <derivedknight> 1995 Anime Dubs are the best! Hell yeah
[4:24:23] <OneThousandTomatoes> @derivedknight some people like them some dont
[4:24:26] <Sol_Install> I love it that they went with that
[4:24:31] <%rumtumtugnutz> the best part is, I think Pat chose this voice and it hurts.
[4:24:33] <derivedknight> Give me that Tenchi Muyo Dub Quality
[4:24:34] <PleaseCallMeSugar> hoooooooh
[4:24:39] <Sol_Install> I'm SPEED
[4:24:40] <cosmicgoatee> woahhh
[4:24:43] <Gamer76255> That's some speed
[4:24:47] <+robotrippin> monkaS
[4:24:49] <blackbookalpha> lol this is why I set camera distance to 100 and camera speed to very fast
[4:24:54] <T_Sasquatch> OOF
[4:24:57] <OneThousandTomatoes> did it just change direction midair?
[4:24:57] <ergulor> Owo
[4:25:02] <akitanito> Magnamalo looks liike something from God Eater instead
[4:25:02] <butthurtdave> I just want some big damage move on Lance for once, nothing spammable but something more immediate and satisfying, doing the Charge Dash on a downed monster is always so finnicky because half the time I clip straight through it and have to turn around. :I
[4:25:04] <OneThousandTomatoes> with an explosion?
[4:25:05] <T_Sasquatch> OOOO TOPPLED
[4:25:10] <Zombrocom> Hellfire Tail Railgun
[4:25:14] <dan_g_v> he's so damn cool!!
[4:25:25] <Zombrocom> Doesn't lance have a charge swing now?
[4:25:46] <Zombrocom> And the shield bash charge switch skill
[4:26:03] <bear_breaker20> >Pat hasnt seen the turf war this guy has
[4:26:05] <PleaseCallMeSugar> narga
[4:26:11] <blackbookalpha> lol he hasn't seen his M Bison moves yet
[4:26:11] <OneThousandTomatoes> velkanna?
[4:26:13] <Sol_Install> yep
[4:26:16] <T_Sasquatch> AYYYY
[4:26:20] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> aw
[4:26:24] <WizardofAahz> lmao I switched from HH to Lance for the same reason
[4:26:25] <Blank9> I wonder if they'll ever bring back Lucent Nargacuga
[4:26:33] <cosmicgoatee> Nergigante is what I like to call the big bulldozer boi
[4:26:40] <WizardofAahz> Lance got radical stuff
[4:26:43] <butthurtdave> the shield bash thing uses up too much stamina and has a really short range to it sadly :(  and the charge swing takes as long to charge up as doing three regular pokes
[4:26:47] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> it probably needs the tail to do the pueple stuff
[4:26:54] <T_Sasquatch> EXCUSE ME ???????
[4:26:56] <Sol_Install> He's has the jet dragon move
[4:26:58] <dan_g_v> talking about stolen moves, anybody seen the latest NCH animation?
[4:27:00] <Sol_Install> and zignore power up
[4:27:15] <dan_g_v> and Teostra crown!
[4:27:15] <T_Sasquatch> damn son
[4:27:16] <PleaseCallMeSugar> right in the face
[4:27:19] <blackbookalpha> he always does 2 slams
[4:27:22] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Damn, this fight looks cool as hell
[4:27:25] <cholesteroid> Meow! What a fur-ightful monster!
[4:27:28] <kasios> WHY DOES HE HAVE EVERYTHING HOLYSHIT
[4:27:39] <OneThousandTomatoes> mch productions released a animated video of magnamallow draining the powers of other monsters and now i see why
[4:27:43] <PleaseCallMeSugar> his kit is just "yes"
[4:27:45] <dan_g_v> yeah, this is a cool fight for the very definite last hunt of the entire game
[4:27:45] <butthurtdave> Jesus, all the new monsters in this game are so elaborate
[4:27:47] <OneThousandTomatoes> nch*
[4:28:01] <blackbookalpha> Pat's getting it, so proud
[4:28:02] <%BoxNavy> no
[4:28:04] <T_Sasquatch> plus teostra explosions
[4:28:07] <Blank9> nope just a brute wyvern
[4:28:07] <PleaseCallMeSugar> he's not even an elder
[4:28:08] <blackbookalpha> @PatStaresAt he's not an elder dragon
[4:28:08] <butthurtdave> nah he's trappable
[4:28:08] <OneThousandTomatoes> nope
[4:28:11] <Sol_Install> the tail
[4:28:11] <BlueSpartan119> Fanged Wyvern
[4:28:13] <Sol_Install> nope
[4:28:15] <AllenDeadman> not an elder dragon I think
[4:28:15] <Zombrocom> Nah, Fanged Wyvern
[4:28:20] <dan_g_v> he's fighting somebody over there
[4:28:21] <PleaseCallMeSugar> he's a fanged wyvern
[4:28:22] <+Gespens> probably a Fanged Wyvern
[4:28:23] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> oh, the large fangs move to the sides of the face...weird
[4:28:25] <luciluxlu0> he's been watching un the sidelines since mh1
[4:28:27] <dan_g_v> yeah that one!
[4:28:30] <AllenDeadman> yup
[4:28:32] <+robotrippin> He and Zinogre are like the only fanged wyverns
[4:28:33] <puse9> he reminds me of nergigante
[4:28:34] <Sol_Install> Fanged wvyern ye
[4:28:44] <kasios> lol he big mad
[4:28:48] <OneThousandTomatoes> zin and the fates four were flagships too

[4:29:04] <AllenDeadman> HE'S ANGRY
[4:29:05] <blackbookalpha> tee hee
[4:29:08] <%Monkeyweed21> Whereas Zinogre is blue, lightning and sword based, Magnamalo is purple, fire, and spear based
[4:29:10] <dan_g_v> he borrowed Nergigante's spikes
[4:29:14] <blackbookalpha> wow that was a one-hit kill move
[4:29:30] <butthurtdave> can you cut his tail twice?
[4:29:32] <OneThousandTomatoes> @blackbookalpha in the demo it was
[4:29:33] <+Opal_Overture> He's a cobbler of killers!!!
[4:29:36] <+robotrippin> @Zombrocom Oh dang you're right. World went hard on them
[4:29:38] <OneThousandTomatoes> probably not here
[4:29:42] <%primarch_lupercal> cos he has actual armor now
[4:29:44] <dan_g_v> but that's a very long tail
[4:29:45] <$scallycap> find out, bitch

[4:38:36] <derivedknight> People do remember that Monster Hunter stories are never to be for the whole game? It's to last for a bit as a tutorial and then you get to the 'real game'

[4:39:47] <AllenDeadman> yup
[4:39:52] <+tweedler92> Ok but why are her pinkies gone?
[4:39:55] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @cimturry in most mh games once you beat the main monster in low rank you get the credits
[4:39:58] <DrBeanie> yup. low rank is just tutorial
[4:39:59] <AllenDeadman> this is the end of low rank I think
[4:40:00] <+Opal_Overture> Cue game journo's saying "We beat the game in 12 hours, rolled credits, and never fought a Rathalos"
[4:40:01] <OneThousandTomatoes> i never noticed wyverians have 4 fingers
[4:40:01] <%Livelinne> In the gonads

[4:40:15] <+Gespens> Dragon Elves
[4:40:16] <butthurtdave> Do you think the G Rank update will be a new game or a DLC?
[4:40:16] <+Akizea> beating village means that you get to skip low rank hub stuff now and just play the rest of the game lol
[4:40:18] <PleaseCallMeSugar> well 2 fewer
[4:40:20] <%troubled_ginger> Yakuza Elves
[4:40:21] <jorniev> has there ever been a bad guy in moster hunter?
[4:40:22] <%ssjklyco> They are Yakuzies
[4:40:24] <akitanito> elder dragons
[4:40:25] <Warbot40> World took way longer than this though for low rank no?
[4:40:26] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> if you think her hands are weird boy wait till you see her feet
[4:40:28] <Quivering_Star> Rise streamlined a lot of tedious stuff out, and cuts the shit instead of giving you a thousand unskippable, long cutscenes.
[4:40:29] <$RealThiele> someone fucked a rathalos
[4:40:31] <DrBeanie> it's still going. . .
[4:40:33] <%BubbaRands> Low rank=great job for pressing start LUL

[4:40:46] <%Monkeyweed21> when she gets old her feet will get all scaly and taloned
[4:40:48] <PleaseCallMeSugar> fucking APPARENTLY they legitimately believe that they evolved from Actual Wyverns
[4:40:49] <AllenDeadman> well...
[4:40:54] <XxEmchammerxX> I like that. My grandma doesn't have a pinky so it reminds me of her.
[4:40:55] <%Frost_Quill> Imagine if they pull an Asura's Wrath and sell you the end of the main story as dlc.
[4:40:59] <AllenDeadman> can't wait for shit to get fucked
[4:40:59] <jorniev> ITS LIKE EVERY DAY WITH THAT GIRL

[4:43:32] <Zombrocom> Khezy and Giggi can both stay gone
[4:43:34] <koffeemancer> just not a key quest
[4:43:36] <%Frost_Quill> So is World just freakishly long compared to other MH games?
