[0:06:11] <%Jekado> Cheer500 Hey Uncle Pat, so I have an Elmo question, besides shaking Elmo's bag do you have another unique way of petting Elmo? My cat Sakamoto likes to sleep between my legs and sometimes she want me to rub her face. The problem is the way I pet her i'm basically holding her head in my face and stroking it back and fourth so it looks like I'm jacking my cats face off. So now my girlfriend and I refer it to jacking my cats face off. It's really awkward too considering where my cats face is.
[0:06:11] <%Guardiansaiyan> @SoFarFetched then I guess we are in Silent Hill

[0:51:05] <%코코꾸라> It runs great on a vanilla PS4
[0:51:09] <%conradical> is this Pat's pee noise
[0:51:12] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @Typhaeon Im disabled LUL

[0:51:20] <%hahaha1171> sell you bath water!
[0:51:20] <%jessedouglas> @collind99 it runs fine for me it's just the textures can be pretty bad
[0:51:20] <%Dragon_Batman> Me too
[0:51:39] <%Dragon_Batman> The textures load stuff is the same on both
[0:51:43] <%cherrycottontail> @코코꾸라 squeenix will have no games for ps5 until like 2025, they're gonna make a ps5 version with some upscaled textures
[0:51:44] <%ShichiNoBushi> He probably has this animation playing on a screen in front of his toilet.
[0:51:46] <%storkeylope> !uptime
[0:51:46] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 3m.
[0:51:47] <%optimasmaximas> @collind99 im playing it on vanilla ps4 and it runs just fine, haven't had any issues outside of the bad textures that pat has seen on stream, but that is with his ps4pro, so it's a problem with the game i guess
[0:51:49] <%bevyrage> this really is pee music huh
[0:51:53] <%MakotoPB> @BallerSwagBro9k That was one of my favorites. Also bomb squad one is great
[0:52:00] <@mothmandraws> man the ff7r version of those who fight further is great
[0:52:04] <@mothmandraws> hearing clean rip on youtube
[0:52:11] <%코코꾸라> @cherrycottontail nah, SE is already working on next-gen exclusive games
[0:52:17] <%Typhaeon> Due Recompense is the official theme of the Jerma walk emote
[0:52:17] <@mothmandraws> plz give me ff14 raid tier with that as generic theme
[0:52:18] <%optimasmaximas> @mothmandraws it's so good Kreygasm
[0:52:24] <%collind99> I know I’ve never had an issue with Sony in house games on my vanilla. God of War and Spider-Man run perfectly
[0:52:29] <%trustycoyote> @collind99 Playing on a base model myself. The only difference compared to Pat's video would be the textures. Framerate is rock solid.
[0:52:33] <%Dragon_Batman> I think the texture thing is a bug cuz there are places that the texture loads and they look good
[0:52:43] <%cherrycottontail> And none of them are ready, they need a release window title
[0:52:48] <%ShichiNoBushi> Do wreck them pants.
[0:52:51] <@mothmandraws> honestly the texture and skyboxes feels like something went wrong in dev to me
[0:52:55] <%cherrycottontail> Just throw a couple ports out
[0:52:56] <@mothmandraws> for those skyboxes to look so poor
[0:52:59] <%Hellarussian> no
[0:52:59] <%jessedouglas> @mothmandraws Every remake version of those who fight further is amazing!

[0:56:03] <%retrohazard> It's gonna be interesting to see how they correct the power creep in the next game. Leaving Midgar with ~ga level magic is a bit broken.

[0:56:10] <%trustycoyote> @PatStaresAt question about materia, does it level up based on how many times the spell is used or just levels with the character?

[0:56:53] <%ShichiNoBushi> Shotgunning predictions.
[0:56:54] <%EuropanLamprey> Cloud tripped and dropped all his materia
[0:56:55] <%DensityD> what does that mean Mr. @DeoxysPrime ?
[0:56:55] <%CelioHogane> @mothmandraws Yuffie steals the materia and sells all of them!
[0:56:59] <%DensityD> Mrs?
[0:57:07] <%optimasmaximas> LUL
[0:57:09] <%delilah4you> Everyone is gonna get hit in th head with frying pan and all of their materia is gonna spill out

[0:57:24] <%sporeian94> Kyrie is Yuffie in disguise MARK MY WORDS
[0:57:26] <%Explodincatz> 3rd game is just an RTS
[0:57:26] <%Aracon_> everyone's back at lvl 1 and mothman steals your materia
[0:57:28] <%SaiyanShoto> That’s a pretty good idea

[0:57:41] <%Nupinoop296> oh no
[0:57:42] <%Dragon_Batman> I mean I have a feeling the start of the next game is Cloud telling his story, not having beat this yet I think that
[0:57:42] <%KawaiiJetty> Yuffie will delevel and ruin everything
[0:57:43] <%linSP> But why did they get weaker
[0:57:43] <%UvBenServed> Nuh uh uh

[0:58:19] <%Ultimatefool> Pentamelding is basically throwing your gil away
[0:58:28] <%Daniel_Is_I> @CelioHogane FF14 materia is just gems

[1:05:51] <%Masamune195> is pat gonna be able to beat the game by monday for spoilercast?
[1:06:00] <@mothmandraws> its probably main load bearing one ultimate
[1:06:01] <%MonsterEnvy> I don't think these Security officers realize they are going to be sqashed by the piller
[1:06:02] <%KawaiiJetty> Only 1, so easy 4Head
[1:06:03] <%cherrycottontail> Two pillars, the central one and the extendoarm
[1:06:04] <%TimetodiveLTX> probably cheaper
[1:06:11] <@mothmandraws> might be others helping it but this one would be big issues
[1:06:11] <%Mr_Pylon> Welcome to Potion tower

[1:06:28] <%Roundelay11> hold L1 when using an item to multiuse them
[1:06:33] <@StridentSong> It's more then just the pillar(s). Each of the plates are also clamps to the ones next to it, so the weight is distributed as well
[1:06:36] <%tigerfang86> look it's a HARD edge
[1:06:38] <%PocketChange117> Hit em with a big metal slab
[1:06:38] <%AllenDeadman> it doesn't need to be LUL
[1:06:39] <%tigerfang86> not a SHARP edge
[1:06:40] <%suikudo> You swing it fast enough and it doesnt need to be
[1:06:41] <%CelioHogane> Why would it be sharp? IS A GIANT SLICE OF METAL
[1:06:42] <%MonsterEnvy> it honestly does not need to be
[1:06:44] <%Aeoneth> Why would clouds sword need to be sharp
[1:06:45] <%EuropanLamprey> At that size, it doesn't need to be
[1:06:46] <%conradical> it's so large, it could hardly even be called a sword
[1:06:48] <%Axellogic> Its a big heavy
[1:06:48] <%stuntdoublejesus> heavy blunt object

[1:14:48] <%pipboy344> How long is Chapter?
[1:14:48] <%KasiCrafter> Dick move for introducing a new flying enemy in the melee-only character section.
[1:14:57] <%Scarnehu> youve always got firaga
[1:14:59] <%Keyd00d> magic exists
[1:15:04] <%Alopekis> They'd be a lot more successful if they just flew past the railing and shot at him from outside the pillar.
[1:15:05] <%conradical> grab his dick and twist it
[1:15:07] <%Keyd00d> No
[1:15:09] <%Djinnazz> HAHA no
[1:15:10] <%pipboy344> Is this halfway through game or late?
[1:15:11] <%Guardiansaiyan> @TimetodiveLTX I don't think so...they weren't that good in the original so...unless Nemesis is in this game it might not work well here
[1:15:13] <%Keyd00d> Oh those
[1:15:13] <%IntrepidEye> I'm trying hard not to notice that he should be spinning around uncontrollably without a counter rotor
[1:15:17] <%Djinnazz> oh, nvm
[1:15:19] <%iwa5h4ck3d> Chadley is pleased
[1:15:20] <%tigerfang86> YOU....... Did it
[1:15:21] <%BigCoffee> @KasiCrafter he could use magic and make it not tedious, tthat"s a Pat problem
[1:15:25] <%ringabal> More or less
[1:15:26] <%Koush> Sort of?
[1:15:26] <%Hellarussian> hmm
[1:15:27] <%Legato_Ambrose> Little over halfway, really
[1:15:27] <%CelioHogane> 40%?
[1:15:27] <%Alopekis> I think it's about halfway
[1:15:28] <%Aracon_> more like 3/4
[1:15:29] <%Ascethetic> kinda
[1:15:29] <%Robot_Nixon_> I think so?
[1:15:29] <%JohnAtDawn> In the game?
[1:15:29] <%Keyd00d> You're past halfway
[1:15:29] <%trustycoyote> It feels like it, right?
[1:15:30] <%bevyrage> @pipboy344 would say this is last third of the story i think
[1:15:33] <%코코꾸라> 70%
[1:15:35] <%IntrepidEye> about 60% i think
[1:15:35] <%pipboy344> Thanks
[1:15:38] <%Ascethetic> more like 70
[1:15:39] <%valriot> Kinda?
[1:15:39] <%mechslayer71> About
[1:15:41] <%cowardman93> probably about 60%
[1:15:42] <%Alopekis> The game is 500 hours long
[1:15:45] <%Keyd00d> There's like 10 hours left
[1:15:45] <%Legato_Ambrose> they said 40 hours, and by golly they meant it
[1:15:46] <%nobodybutalex> this is like 70-80 %
[1:15:50] <%mechslayer71> 60 or 70 I guess
[1:15:50] <%KasiCrafter> Wow, look at all this MURDER.
[1:15:53] <%Hellarussian> 66.66% repeating of course
[1:15:54] <@StridentSong> Yea, this is like 60-65%
[1:15:55] <%conradical> use magic
[1:15:59] <%toastybites> What how is Wutai involved in this
[1:16:00] <%Nobrev> I'd say 60 because the final stretch is super fuckin long
[1:16:01] <%sniffy77> Someone is gonna wait till all of the parts are out and then beat them all in one go
[1:16:03] <%TimetodiveLTX> @guardiansaiyan i know in the FF7o speedrun they use them early on at low level
[1:16:13] <%CelioHogane> KILL THOSE SOLDIERS, THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING!
[1:16:18] <%bevyrage> this is the big arc before [spoiler] [spoilers] given it's where the second plate is threatening to drop
[1:16:29] <%televisedrevolting> Is this a Mind Goblin or does Pat just not remember he can use magic?
[1:16:30] <%valriot> Man, if only you had some form of..not sword attack doodSmug
[1:16:35] <%Guardiansaiyan> @TimetodiveLTX probably will stay low level
[1:16:36] <%KawaiiJetty> Well feels like half way judging with the original ff7
[1:16:36] <%jessedouglas> @sniffy77 I was saying that last stream! that's going to be nuts!
[1:16:37] <%Campfire_Chronicles> does aero bring them down?
[1:16:38] <%conradical> hey pat, do you still get the mind goblins for using items? you're using them a lot more here
[1:16:39] <%Manjove> these retcon ghosts really give me Final Destination vibes.

[1:18:43] <%InfamousShephard> I dont think he beleived cloud hto
[1:18:43] <%Ascethetic> shut up tho
[1:18:43] <%CelioHogane> Turks are also pretty fucking strong, tho
[1:18:45] <%valriot> Turks are pretty buff to be fair
[1:18:45] <%iosephe> helicopter though
[1:18:46] <%conradical> turks are pretty super freak too
[1:18:46] <%BigCoffee> He still doesn't think Cloud's a soldier
[1:18:48] <%VashyronM> Reno does think Cloud is full of shit though
[1:18:49] <%JohnAtDawn> He doesn't believe Cloud is really First, remember?
[1:18:49] <%Campfire_Chronicles> wonder if that was some kind of pun in Japanese
[1:18:49] <%Deft_Thought> Is there every an explanation as to why the Turks are such monsters?
[1:18:49] <%MonsterEnvy> Reno and the Turks beat up Soliders
[1:18:49] <%cowardman93> @Shockrates20XX Turks are secret police, Shinra military are just the army and SOLDIER is the elite spec ops unit
[1:18:51] <%SH1NK1R0> @MonsterEnvy it weird that shinra set them up as wutai pawns when their organisation actually are wutai pawns
[1:18:51] <%Valdorick> Aren't the turks Mako infused too?
[1:18:52] <%starotter70> Yet he should also know who WAS in soldier
[1:18:53] <%shurtal> reno doesn't believe cloud was in soldier
[1:18:54] <%doc_ock_rokc> First classes though should be like...world enders
[1:18:54] <%RetroCop87> Turks are super freaks -1, so they think they can take them
[1:18:56] <%IntrepidEye> Reno doesn't think you're a SOLDIER
[1:18:58] <%Pyroclase> Where did Rude and Reno learn how to fly black hawks?
[1:18:59] <%tigerfang86> RUDE'S REALLY BAD AT IT TOO LUL
[1:18:59] <%mechslayer71> Reno didn’t believe him tho @patstaresat
[1:19:00] <%Ultimatefool> Turks are mid-high tier
[1:19:01] <%MonsterEnvy> THey are the ones that recruit them.
[1:19:01] <%claudesavegely> Rude this fuckin nerd
[1:19:03] <%LordSDB> Reno doesn't believe he's solider 1 remember
[1:19:07] <%JumbleJams> is that just a soundbite?
[1:19:08] <%ringabal> JAPANESE DUB MOVEMENTS
[1:19:10] <%Alopekis> He doesn't blieve that you're a first class, if he believes you're a SOLDIER at all.

[1:23:41] <%DensityD> whatever you say babayaga, you old cron
[1:23:42] <%DonatelloJose> everyone scatter.
[1:23:46] <%Manjove> the Retcon Ghosts are busy with the Plate, thus cannot police Aerith and Wedge?
[1:23:46] <%DensityD> wretched hag
[1:23:47] <%Robot_Nixon_> thats grim, did literally everyone in the sector get smooshed? I can't remember
[1:23:51] <%valriot> Thanks Old Paige
[1:23:51] <%jiin6> Colonel Cambell is going to be sooo mad
[1:23:54] <%flamingmonkies2> Those ghosts are gonna have lots of work to do

[1:24:00] <%Alopekis> @This_is_Marco Pretty much
[1:24:00] <%PocketChange117> @Guardiansaiyan oof gotcha. I'll imagine it's as big as a city lol
[1:24:03] <%Aeoneth> @This_is_Marco very few got out
[1:24:03] <%DensityD> @valriot LUL
[1:24:09] <%pipboy344> @this_is_marco Everyone on both levels died
[1:24:12] <%Ascethetic> MERLE IS BEST ADDITION
[1:24:15] <%Robot_Nixon_> FeelsBadMan
[1:24:17] <%코코꾸라> Thanks old Paige
[1:24:17] <%CelioHogane> You killed them, i think?
[1:24:18] <%Alopekis> You murdered the ghosts
[1:24:19] <%Roundelay11> Why? This is canon
[1:24:19] <%InfamousShephard> they on break
[1:24:20] <%BigCoffee> @PatStaresAt Yes but this is bad storytelling
[1:24:21] <%Keyd00d> Ghosts are on break
[1:24:21] <%Valdorick> They're busy being dead.
[1:24:22] <%Xenokhrist> NOPE this was in the original, just offscreen
[1:24:22] <%linSP> So only the rich die yay!
[1:24:24] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> THEORY IS WRONG I GUESS
[1:24:25] <%Ancopro> Ghosts a lil confused right now
[1:24:26] <%UvBenServed> All according to cake?
[1:24:26] <%za7az> They're tired
[1:24:27] <%BallerSwagBro9k> AERITH OVER HEAVEN
[1:24:27] <%Hellarussian> oh..
[1:24:30] <%MonsterEnvy> Maybe the Ghosts don't care about the minor people
[1:24:30] <%Roundelay11> This was just offscreen
[1:24:30] <%cherrycottontail> Ghosts are distracted by cloud tryiung to make sure the thing drops
[1:24:31] <%Daniel_Is_I> GHOST COPTER
[1:24:31] <%Ultimatefool> They don't get paid enough
[1:24:32] <%KawaiiJetty> Ghosts are smoking now
[1:24:32] <%heyitsbrian> they're nust NPC's, so they don't matter?
[1:24:33] <%Alopekis> They have to wait to respawn before they can do anything.
[1:24:34] <%bevyrage> i feel that the ghosts have a very limited scope on the matter
[1:24:35] <%Aeoneth> I have a theory on that
[1:24:36] <%KasiCrafter> Aerith is just HANDING out script pages.
[1:24:36] <%tigerfang86> DID A GHOST JUST HIT A COPTER
[1:24:37] <%DakotaMacDoodle> Probably does not matter
[1:24:38] <%Nupinoop296> brownTHINK brownTHINK brownTHINK
[1:24:38] <%meatxsteam> PAT YOU JINXED IT!
[1:24:39] <%Roundelay11> You don't know that

[1:28:10] <%Alopekis> The paradox only exists if you're changing a specific timeline. If you go to a different timeline, then you could change stuff there without it creating a paradox with the original.
[1:28:11] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> LUL Good
[1:28:11] <%ChaosAethr> Yes
[1:28:11] <%BoomerUnchained> Sure does
[1:28:12] <%toastybites> We're just ignoring Crisis Core now eh

[1:41:51] <%Keyd00d> great job tifa
[1:41:52] <%Valdorick> AMAZING
[1:41:54] <%Aleate> Nice!

[1:42:04] <%Aracon_> psaBig waste
[1:42:05] <%CelioHogane> WON'T MISS
[1:42:05] <%BubbaRands> good job Tifa psaUp
[1:42:13] <%spiritofmojave> Guess she do miss sometimes
[1:42:14] <%Valdorick> what a mess of a fight
[1:42:21] <%Ascethetic> Paige needs to play this hard mode first time or no balls
[1:42:30] <%Nupinoop296> he actually sounded kind of like Quinton Flynn for a sec there
[1:42:40] <%IntrepidEye> flying enemies have consistently been the worst thing about the combat system in this game
[1:42:55] <%Scarnehu> luck up for steal
[1:42:56] <%iwa5h4ck3d> How do you like the music in this section
[1:43:04] <%valriot> Flying enemies aren't a problem if you actually use magic LUL
[1:43:14] <%KasiCrafter> The only thing keeping Reno safe is the fact that the Helicopter doesn't have a health bar.
[1:43:17] <%mechslayer71> @intrepideye Which is why it’s insane to me that you can make Barret a melee fighter LUL
[1:43:18] <%Legato_Ambrose> Even when I wasn't really paying attention to the music, it always felt good
[1:43:23] <%pipboy344> @nupinoop296 Raiden = Lightening
[1:43:29] <@StridentSong> Luck Up also increases Crit chance
[1:43:34] <%pipboy344> Lightning
[1:43:37] <%Keyd00d> I just wish the Turks theme still had snapping
[1:43:39] <%Ascethetic> i gotta say, Im really happy they made fire an aoe
[1:43:50] <%TimetodiveLTX> can't you not use magic again until ATB recovers, which happens faster when you attack?
[1:43:55] <%Valdorick> wow, that guy ate it hard.
[1:43:56] <%pipboy344> He find Jessie yet?
[1:44:02] <%starotter70> Nope

[1:45:53] <@SoFarFetched> @BallerSwagBro9k you missed the scene with him earlier
[1:45:53] <%Daniel_Is_I> @BallerSwagBro9k Sitting with a bullet in his stomach five floors down
[1:45:55] <%Keyd00d> HE DIED
[1:45:57] <%sund0wner> These characters are all asexual and reproduce by budding
[1:45:57] <%Typhaeon> Stage Fatality

[1:45:59] <%Hellarussian> WOW that guy died
[1:46:00] <%Laecerelius> That guy is super dead
[1:46:00] <%hahaha1171> f
[1:46:03] <%BallerSwagBro9k> OOF
[1:46:03] <%Ancopro> that poor man got wedged
[1:46:04] <%CelioHogane> DOUBLE DEAD
[1:46:06] <@mothmandraws> just knocked out
[1:46:06] <%Legato_Ambrose> He's so dead
[1:46:06] <%iwa5h4ck3d> Nah you webbed him to the tower
[1:46:08] <%Valdorick> That guy just ate it like OG Wedge
[1:46:13] <%KawaiiJetty> Oof that ring out
[1:46:13] <%LordSDB> Shoryuo off a clip
[1:46:14] <%BubbaRands> nah he's gud
[1:46:17] <%Dakuu75> she's getting dicked off screen right now. why do you think she sets her bomb timmers so long
[1:46:17] <%Run44forrest> OOOF
[1:46:21] <%SaiyanShoto> He knew what he signed up for
[1:46:22] <%Zebroneath> the ghosts willsave him from the fall
[1:46:22] <%hmgirlpopuri> I know the Helitroopers were in the original but they keep making me think of the dumb spinning lightsaber flying
[1:46:24] <%Run44forrest> jesus
[1:46:26] <%IntrepidEye> Tifa feels like she can hit flyers better than Cloud
[1:46:30] <%ratreborn> Regen is awful in this one
[1:46:35] <%Daniel_Is_I> Regen looks like it sucks
[1:46:35] <%sund0wner> Regen's a LOT slower
[1:46:40] <%Aracon_> Regen is ass
[1:46:41] <%Ascethetic> regen sucks so much
[1:46:41] <%linSP> fuck yeah I love that they can ring out
[1:46:43] <%IntrepidEye> Regen is trash
[1:46:44] <%Typhaeon> Would be good for longer battles
[1:46:46] <%spiritofmojave> Regen is a waste of a cast now
[1:46:51] <%Aracon_> it's such a waste
[1:46:51] <%prism_zet> its good to cast right at the start of a big fight
[1:46:52] <%spiritofmojave> Just use Cure2/3
[1:46:53] <%Axellogic> its like poison and is only in combat
[1:46:57] <%Dakuu75> I like regen...
[1:46:58] <%RetroCop87> this section is a resource whore
[1:46:59] <%valriot> Regen is good on Aerith, or magic build Cloud
[1:47:00] <%bevyrage> regen is for boss fights, cure is for clutch heals and any normal combat
[1:47:01] <%BigCoffee> not really, put regen with all, cast it early
[1:47:07] <%ScottishMadJacko> Regen is fantastic for boss battles and long encounters but otherwise use regular heals
[1:47:11] <%Ascethetic> @spiritofmojave except Barret
[1:47:20] <%sund0wner> Regen seems good as like an auxiliary solution for whoever's getting hit in your periphery like Aerith
[1:47:24] <%spiritofmojave> @Ascethetic tru
[1:47:24] <%starotter70> More Attack
[1:47:27] <%rufus2k2> Number go UP
[1:47:29] <%bevyrage> oh yeah, regen all is solid
[1:47:31] <%mechslayer71> Regen is great on a tanky Barret
[1:47:38] <%Ascethetic> Barret is my healer and he sucks at it
[1:47:41] <%SH1NK1R0> Tifa has better air combos with max chi
[1:47:42] <%sund0wner> Staggerino
[1:47:49] <%Aracon_> I'm sure if properly optimized regen is better
[1:48:01] <%heyitsbrian> love that the voices go all slow-mo
[1:48:01] <%Sir_stride> this gamw really makes you appreciate barret in battle
[1:48:05] <%Pyroclase> yeah, you punch those robots, Tifa
[1:48:14] <%Ascethetic> oof
[1:48:15] <%Valdorick> Mortis
[1:48:16] <%fragdar> soooo, in the original game, jessie and the other two dudes all die in this part?
[1:48:17] <%Dementedpenguin> You did
[1:48:17] <%BigCoffee> use magic
[1:48:18] <%Aracon_> RIP
[1:48:21] <%mechslayer71> @sir_stride Having him on range and as a tank is borderline essential
[1:48:23] <%bevyrage> aerith on arcane ward casting a regen all will outpace the optimised cure so long as you got a full party
[1:48:27] <%cowardman93> if only you had magic
[1:48:28] <%spiritofmojave> Chakra is pretty good to use for immediate heals
[1:48:28] <%Keyd00d> pat revive now
[1:48:29] <%BigCoffee> @fragdar yup, they all die awful deaths
[1:48:31] <%Ultimatefool> @fragdar Yes, pretty much all of Sector 7 dies
[1:48:33] <%Nobrev> thunder should one shot those turrets
[1:48:37] <%Verd_254> If only you had some kind of electrical attack for the robots
[1:48:40] <%Aracon_> pat should have level 3 magic by now so he should use that
[1:48:41] <%fragdar> oh damn
[1:48:49] <@mothmandraws> HEALER LB3
[1:48:53] <%spiritofmojave> Poor Tiffers
[1:48:53] <%Sir_stride> @mechslayer71 bro. his maximum fury ability CUTS through enemies
[1:48:57] <%GarbageQueenEllie> goddamn flies
[1:48:58] <%mechslayer71> Does pat just refuse to use thunder
[1:49:07] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Yes
[1:49:07] <%Aracon_> wait does pat not have chakra on tifa?
[1:49:10] <%Keyd00d> healers adjust for tifa
[1:49:14] <%MonsterEnvy> Magic
[1:49:15] <%spiritofmojave> Any air enemy is cause there's barely combos
[1:49:16] <%hrudzie_1> magic bru
[1:49:17] <%mechslayer71> @sir_stride Focus shot on a pressured enemy Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm
[1:49:22] <%Dakuu75> probably jsut forgot he has it. don't worry about it guys. he'll win without it.
[1:49:23] <%BigCoffee> Pat's playing this game like Kingdom Hearts instead of 80% turn based with a side of action
[1:49:26] <%bevyrage> i don't think pat is using chakra on tifa, though he should have it
[1:49:27] <%Ascethetic> @mothmandraws THE DRG ALREADY USED IT
[1:49:27] <%TheMattman1313> If only you had aero
[1:49:28] <%fragdar> too bad that the original is like 16 euros on ps store.. really want to play it
[1:49:28] <%ImmaCanuck> This camera sfoxNO
[1:49:33] <%Explodincatz> nice camera
[1:49:37] <%Keyd00d> spend that atb
[1:49:40] <%CelioHogane> Limit break
[1:49:42] <%SH1NK1R0> Aero solves them instantly
[1:49:43] <%coreyyotto> They're still weak to fire
[1:49:50] <%KawaiiJetty> Kh2 devs hate aerial melee fighting huh
[1:49:54] <%VHGS> @SH1NK1R0 not if they're LITERALLY MOVING AT ALL
[1:49:58] <%Dragon_Batman> God dam, don't you just love it when DoorDash just fucks up an order entirely?
[1:50:05] <%BigCoffee> no
[1:50:08] <%Alazull> Yes
[1:50:12] <%VashyronM> Wouldn't know. Never use it
[1:50:13] <%Dakuu75> yep
[1:50:17] <%Piemen99> of course
[1:50:19] <%spiritofmojave> yeeep
[1:50:19] <%ImmaCanuck> maybe
[1:50:20] <%Dragon_Batman> Don't use it
[1:50:20] <%Aeoneth> That's why I go pick up my food
[1:50:25] <%Aeoneth> or used to

[1:50:27] <%Alazull> That's one dang big ol' pillar
[1:50:41] <%rufus2k2> this still a blind playthrough for Pat right?
[1:50:43] <%Alazull> It's almost like there shouldn't be one of these per huge aerial city sections
[1:50:43] <%Dakuu75> I haven't ordered out in like 4 months though now
[1:50:43] <%KasiCrafter> POG Elixer
[1:50:46] <%SH1NK1R0> @VHGS oh wow look at that it solved it
[1:50:48] <%Aeoneth> Look at that Groundbox
[1:50:52] <%Japanfreak2595> I never got KH comparisons with the Remake because it plays more like a Tales game.

[1:59:33] <%Tearonex> Barrets the only one I have at full HP right now
[1:59:47] <%Ultimatefool> @johnchikr Just thought the same thing, he's doing Sora's air combo from KH2
[1:59:49] <%Aeoneth> Reno has some good gear you might wanna steal off him
[1:59:51] <%Aracon_> oh boy
[1:59:52] <%tigerfang86> WHOA

[1:59:58] <%Dragon_Batman> I mean I can see the KH in Reno but, he is the faster of the two so it works
[2:00:02] <%Keyd00d> god damn reno wasn't this agressive to me
[2:00:11] <%sund0wner> Barret got his shit pushed in a bit
[2:00:12] <%JohnAtDawn> Yeah this is around when the combat starts to fall apart.
[2:00:14] <%Nupinoop296> yeah that really is a Sora air combo holy shit
[2:00:17] <%sund0wner> Oof
[2:00:18] <%Bane_Kaikyo> B-BARRETO-SAN

[2:00:33] <%DensityD> sora donald goofy DRINK
[2:00:42] <%weissguard> I really hope we get DLC where we can play as Reno. His moves are so damn cool.
[2:00:55] <%Aracon_> I know pat likes barrier on magnify but by the looks of things I think cure on magnify is more useful
[2:01:03] <%JohnAtDawn> It is
[2:01:06] <%KawaiiJetty> Kh2 devs worked on this so yea
[2:01:14] <%sund0wner> Rude's move set's pretty cool too
[2:01:14] <%zetastriker> I don't want to criticize Pat, but I'd love to see him block or dodge even just ONE attack. XD
[2:01:21] <%amused_platypus> you can do this
[2:01:22] <%Keyd00d> yes
[2:01:23] <%Dragon_Batman> It would also help if that weapon had buff duration up
[2:01:24] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Cure on magnify makes Cure WAYYY too weak

[2:02:17] <%Dragon_Batman> Uh oh does Pat realize Barret is stuck?
[2:02:17] <%SparkAfterDark> Pray is so much more appropriate for Barret than for Aerith
[2:02:18] <%aishman> So let me get this straight, he makes Reno miss shooting at Tifa, only to then actively start throwing bombs at her direction.
[2:02:18] <%aslfrasle> @PatStaresAt SCAN RUDE'S HELICOPTER
[2:02:18] <%ringabal> SOMASAOUT

[2:03:02] <%IntrepidEye> Is that Tseng in the back there chilling

[2:12:59] <%bearking05> cannon can eat its own ass
[2:12:59] <%EuropanLamprey> Remember, Shinra did nothing wrong, it was all the time ghosts fault
[2:12:59] <%rufus2k2> Man can you believe Barret in a Japan character Poll is ranked like 186 out of 200? The Shoopuff Driver ranks higher!

[2:13:17] <%CelioHogane> @rufus2k2 Japan has no taste
[2:13:17] <%SparkAfterDark> It turns out FF7 was bad actually and if you like it you should feel bad.
[2:13:18] <%indig0bird> Canon can go suck a fucking dick
[2:13:19] <%Valdorick> Nourmua just wants to make a story, but the Square Exec Cannon Ghosts demand the plot be the same.

[2:21:53] <%ChaosAethr> FATED TO DIE
[2:21:53] <%Maids4lyfe> Wedge saved a lot of people
[2:21:54] <%SparkAfterDark> Wedge didn't get last words
[2:21:55] <%EuropanLamprey> Cloud: I'll do it for 500 gil
[2:21:56] <%SvenHolgersson> WEDGE WAS A HERO
[2:21:58] <%Valdorick> Then again, maybe the Ghosts ghost walled the people who were suppose to die too
[2:21:59] <%KawaiiJetty> Wedge is a damn hero

[2:22:07] <%Shockrates20XX> Her horniness would save the planet
[2:22:08] <%MonsterEnvy> You just ran by all the NPC's you can talk to
[2:22:08] <%Keyd00d> She was splooshing too much
[2:22:08] <%weissguard> Wedge the True Hero that Zack always wanted to be.
[2:22:08] <%valkuma> Jessie was eligible for marriage that would have fucked the future up
[2:22:09] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @PatStaresAt The partial loss is almost worse than the complete loss
[2:22:09] <%hahaha1171> i think they still died?
[2:22:10] <%tigerfang86> wedge saved people and the ghosts got SUPER SALTY about it
[2:22:13] <%preppyposs> WEDGE THE TRUE HERO
[2:22:14] <%valriot> She was TOO WET for time
[2:22:14] <%pipboy344> GO BACK AND TALK TO SAM AND MADAME
[2:22:15] <%toastybites> Why is Plate Separation even a function to begin with
[2:22:15] <%MakotoPB> @mechslayer71 Why don't poor people just stop living in ghettos if they don't want to get murdered
[2:22:15] <%johnchikr> @mechslayer71 lot of people can’ afford to just pick up and leave
[2:22:16] <%Cardz_> Her thirst was too great
[2:22:16] <%doc_ock_rokc> So FF pat died trying to save FF Elmo
[2:22:18] <%alcors_wisdom> doomed for thottery
[2:22:19] <%Movemeister> If Jesse was alive repopulation wouldn't be a problem
[2:22:20] <%Dragon_Batman> Pretty much
[2:22:20] <%Aracon_> ghosts biased towards main characters :(
[2:22:21] <%j0ustar> The thirst was upsetting the balance
[2:22:21] <%GohanHitsugaya> Big thirst, too strong!
[2:22:21] <%CelioHogane> She had the ability to ACTUALLY fuck Cloud.
[2:22:25] <%amused_platypus> jessie's bomb had it going on
[2:22:29] <%heartlesshealer> Man slaughters goblins to ignore all side content psaBlind
[2:22:30] <%ringabal> The dancing was pretty good
[2:22:32] <%LandOfTheWay> cloud only has two hands; jessie added in would have disrupted the timeline
[2:22:32] <%cowardman93> @pipboy344 stop backseating dude
[2:22:33] <%tusk102> @Dakuu75 the outside world is filled to the brim with strong ass monsters. theres tons of outside civilization, but it gets attacked constantly
[2:22:34] <%superstarsage> No see, Jessie was a warmurderer sentenced by the JenevaGhosts to fateblight
[2:22:36] <%Dakuu75> it's a "house"... it's a FUCKING MANSION
[2:22:36] <%preppyposs> tahts just like
[2:22:36] <%KasiCrafter> Thirst so powerful that the flow of time would have been endangered.
[2:22:38] <%sporeian94> yeah red xiii in that soldier suit is tragic
[2:22:42] <%Robot_Nixon_> Worldbuilding PogChamp
[2:22:45] <%fragdar> the worse part is the dude dying trying to save his cats
[2:22:45] <%mechslayer71> @makotopb I meant the people on the plate too. Everyone on top of sector 7 died too
[2:22:46] <%hrudzie_1> have you looked up yet
[2:22:49] <%hrudzie_1> new jpeg in the sky
[2:22:49] <%preppyposs> OH NO BIGGS

[2:22:52] <%Dakuu75> @tusk102 oh, huh. I never knew that.
[2:22:52] <%Robot_Nixon_> @sporeian94 LUL
[2:22:53] <%barkon345> well all three of them were supposed to die
[2:22:53] <%Laecerelius> Midgar's still mourning that thing that happened like ten minutes ago
[2:22:55] <%Valdorick> Tell the Kids about Biggs!
[2:22:55] <%SparkAfterDark> Just like DMC, Jessie is the most powerful because she's the only character that knows what sex is
[2:22:56] <%axiomthunder> biggs loved them orphans
[2:22:58] <%BigCoffee> Bigg's orphans
[2:22:58] <%suikudo> How will Barret ever dress like a sailor now!?
[2:23:05] <%myriad_truth> Everybody is DEAD!
[2:23:06] <%televisedrevolting> That part of the sky is gone now.
[2:23:06] <%realm_forge> Wedge is currently living up to his name between 2 multi ton concrete chunks

[2:23:18] <%RAAAAAINMAKER> 2 bedrooms and a dining room counts as a mansion
[2:23:19] <%hmgirlpopuri> Jessie got it worse than Dizzy in Starship troopers because at least Diz got some before the end
[2:23:20] <%flamingmonkies2> Jessie and the crew's death hit with much less force when they only had about 12 lines before they died
[2:23:21] <%cowardman93> he's kind of freaking out
[2:23:23] <%conradical> you can't just barge into someone's house screaming
[2:23:23] <%linSP> Why tf would you build a pizza over a town tho
[2:23:25] <%Nupinoop296> he can't put it away Paige

[2:32:32] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> That is a possibility that is higher than zero which is too high
[2:32:33] <%sund0wner> Pat's mind has deteriorated into something entirely primal

[2:32:47] <%ringabal> Got me a case of the vapors I do I do
[2:32:48] <%sund0wner> That was just a string of thickly laid emotional wreckage
[2:32:48] <%MakotoPB> Tifa's knockout looks couldn't save everyone from the hardcore feels
[2:32:49] <%Aydarkzero> THERE'S NO BRAKES ON NOMURAS WILD RIDE
[2:32:51] <%cvp5127> is chadley at least dead?
[2:32:52] <%KawaiiJetty> I forgot about that Pat, thanks psaWhat

[2:32:55] <%CelioHogane> @Japanfreak2595 and Aerith Dad
[2:32:56] <%alcors_wisdom> actually if you think about it the ghost will protect aerith indefinitely so i guess its fine
[2:32:57] <%TheAsianAvenger96> Are we sure that Wedge is dead? We didn't exactly see him die
[2:32:58] <%suikudo> "maybe she is ok" one city dropped on another
[2:32:59] <%sund0wner> Emotional cataclysm
[2:33:03] <%Valdorick> Chadley was in whoreland
[2:33:04] <%Robot_Nixon_> Cast cure on the sadness
[2:33:05] <%Campfire_Chronicles> ain't no stopping this train

[2:33:09] <%suikudo> Stupid sons of bitches
[2:33:09] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Barret's hot muscles couldn't save us from the big sad
[2:33:10] <%heartlesshealer> "My favorite!"
[2:33:10] <%Mr_Pylon> It's some high quality sadness!
[2:33:11] <%sund0wner> Anyone else besides me automate their weapon upgrades?

[2:33:25] <%SparkAfterDark> Time to go back to wall market and bust out some grief nuts
[2:33:30] <%MoraMiarty> Imagine if Edison Electric was run by a cultist and had a paramlitary
[2:33:32] <%suikudo> Yeea
[2:33:33] <%Daskolin> BTW Literally everything bad happened in FF7 because of m*therf*ckin HOJO!!!
[2:33:36] <%heartlesshealer> Go help
[2:33:36] <%NitronStreams> I cant believe a final fantasy game is actually making me feel emotions
[2:33:37] <%Shwepie> @za7az This is the internet, a land of terrible mental images.
[2:33:40] <%axiomthunder> potty break!
[2:33:40] <%Japanfreak2595> Chadley was making Materia with Blackjack and hookers
[2:33:41] <%Teh_Un> psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead

[2:33:42] <%alcors_wisdom> "nuke the middle east to get rid of ISIS"
[2:33:42] <%televisedrevolting> Now wait for at least 10 years for 5 minutes of pure sadness.

[2:34:08] <%CaptainBright> Hojo just did NTR and he NEARLY destroyed all of the world
[2:34:09] <%weissguard> Here's hoping they don't get some jackass of a delivery person again.
[2:34:16] <%vincerocmm> th a d00/ has

[2:34:54] <%ScottishMadJacko> Barrett screaming out for everyone got me the worst tbh
[2:34:54] <%PanicSwytch> What if its the same dick head deliveryman?
[2:34:54] <@SoFarFetched> My hammer swing was too slow
[2:34:55] <%Hellarussian> all that was missing was a collage of WW2 horrors for an hour straight
[2:35:02] <%myriad_truth> I'm crying ugly right mow
[2:35:03] <%Aracon_> psaHoldon chat
[2:35:04] <%JumbleJams> bruh i forgot how sad this game is fuck
[2:35:09] <%Dragon_Batman> @TurtlesAndTentacles oooh god the can't breathe gasps too strong
[2:35:17] <%ringabal> More like The Collapse of My Emotional Stability
[2:35:21] <@StridentSong> There wasn't details so it was a timeout, but any further then that and it's gonna be a ban
[2:35:27] <%valkuma> @SoFarFetched the internet butthurt about not wanting to just boringly retell a 20 year old plot knows no ends
[2:35:31] <%heartlesshealer> Can't wait to see how sad they make Vincent's stuff when they make the other parts
[2:35:35] <@mothmandraws> I gotta go do savage reclears, be good chat
[2:35:40] <%collind99> @stridentsong how do I get a discord invite
[2:35:41] <%imthewisejanitor> Just went through this whole segment last night, basically cried my way all the way up the pillar and up to this exact point. Time to play along with the stream before I get spoiled on some shit!
[2:35:42] <%odinthepirate> odinthepirate subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months! Keep those hands washed and your targetable weak points clean!
[2:35:46] <%GarbageQueenEllie> I want my Tifa x Aerith merch NOW
[2:35:50] <%Dragon_Batman> It is really nice that they go into more with this Remake than the Og
[2:35:52] <%spiritofmojave> @mothmandraws gooood luc
[2:35:55] <%ammobasket> Man I hope they rework Vincent a bit better
[2:35:58] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> @Dragon_Batman Way too strong. Jessie and Wedge broke me UGH
[2:36:00] <%Solid_Stro> Can we just remember the good old times back at the Honeybee Inn
[2:36:03] <@SoFarFetched> @StridentSong The timeout hammer is the balloon hammer that goes "bonk",real ban hammer weighs a ton.
[2:36:07] <%Solid_Stro> Good times
[2:36:17] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Crossdressing dancing good times
[2:36:23] <@StridentSong> @collind99 You have to connect your Twitch account to your Discord. Once do you that, after about an hour the discord will show up in your Connections area
[2:36:24] <%rumtumtugnutz> even people who professed to have never played FF7 have been complaining about changesm
[2:36:28] <%spiritofmojave> Cloud needs his own dancing minigame
[2:36:32] <@SoFarFetched> It weighs a ton because of all chats sins.
[2:36:33] <%ringabal> I liked the part where Cloud danced erotically
[2:36:33] <%NitronStreams> This alternate reality shit really does a good job of giving you hope just to shatter it.
[2:36:37] <%Alazull> Remember when Cloud nailed it? What if we didn't have to move on?
[2:36:39] <%heartlesshealer> Vincent should be a lot better this time around, especially now that they have Dirge of Cerberus lore to pull off of
[2:36:41] <%linSP> sector 7 was an inside job orchestrated by shinra
[2:36:42] <%jiin6> I want my Aerith with a chair limit break
[2:36:44] <%tigerfang86> remember when cloud was "yes I know nailed it, moving on"
[2:36:45] <%valkuma> rumtumtugnutz the internet hate machine has no breaks, or logic
[2:36:52] <%tigerfang86> good times.....
[2:36:53] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Yes it does @NitronStreams
[2:36:57] <%Valdorick> @collind99 and protip - Read the #Rules
[2:37:01] <%ringabal> Chocobos can't melt Sector Pillars
[2:37:02] <%Valdorick> When you get in there.
[2:37:03] <%cowardman93> @StridentSong might be worth putting into emote mode when Pat starts the game back up
[2:37:06] <%Dragon_Batman> @TurtlesAndTentacles I feel ya, Young Aerith ususally tips me over
[2:37:13] <%myriad_truth> My tears hit their limit break
[2:37:17] <%tigerfang86> ^
[2:37:18] <%Fenrirlives> ight chat what're your hopes for Vincent Gameplay? I'm hoping he keeps his transformations as fast acting Devil Trigger like limit breaks!
[2:37:18] <@StridentSong> I am not going to use Emote Only mode unless absolutely necessary
[2:37:20] <%rumtumtugnutz> @valkuma the degree of idiocy the internet is capable of astounds.
[2:37:28] <%cowardman93> for me Barret breaking gets my tears going
[2:37:30] <%Valdorick> How many bans tonight, Strident?
[2:37:31] <%s_xylocalsingles> *just ban them all Strident. ban them all.
[2:37:32] <%GarbageQueenEllie> I hope my child ends up being an alien freakazoid that can talk to ghosts
[2:37:33] <@StridentSong> As long as we can keep up with the people spoiling, it's fine in Sub mode
[2:37:36] <%Solid_Stro> Whenever something sad happens, just intercut the dance sequence
[2:37:38] <@StridentSong> 3 timesouts, no bans yet
[2:37:38] <%tigerfang86> kill em all strident
[2:37:39] <%Piemono> @linsp Get out of here with your crazy conspiracy theories!
[2:37:41] <%CaptainBright> .....Somehow the idea of all of FF7R coming out and having this much time put into it and being released across all of my 30s is making it SET IN HARD
[2:37:41] <%cowardman93> fair dude, just chat seems a little spoiler happy today
[2:37:49] <%toastybites> Drop a plate on them
[2:37:51] <%Valdorick> Still going on the 5 bans = emote mode rule?
[2:37:52] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> I just woke up, what did I miss?
[2:37:52] <%Guardiansaiyan> hello?
[2:37:53] <%heartlesshealer> I'm honestly hoping Vincent is just a Dante without swords
[2:37:56] <%Aracon_> oh lol I didn't even realize we're in sub only mode
[2:37:59] <%Typhaeon> Well that was a series of gut punches
[2:38:00] <%myriad_truth> Ban them all!
[2:38:05] <%Guardiansaiyan> I left when the plate was falling down...where is Pat now???
[2:38:05] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> @Dragon_Batman That's why I said if they do Cloud's break down? I'm gonna be FUCKED
[2:38:07] <%JumbleJams> plat drop but with happy chocobo music
[2:38:08] <%Hellarussian> SPOILERS: Cloud dabs
[2:38:12] <%cowardman93> @King_Wolf_Rigger you missed sadness hour
[2:38:12] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Remember that part in FF7 where Cloud and Barret kiss
[2:38:17] <@StridentSong> Not really. That was more for when it was still new and there was 2k+ people
[2:38:19] <%SvenHolgersson> The only one that was sad was Wedge
[2:38:19] <%Dragon_Batman> Thanks for working so hard Mods, I could imagine how tough it is to jump back and forth
[2:38:22] <%Aydarkzero> @GarbageQueenEllie N-no monkaS
[2:38:23] <%ringabal> This whole sequence was great
[2:38:24] <@StridentSong> We can handle chat as it currently is
[2:38:25] <%coffeeabomination> Man not going to lie this stream is rough cause I missed a lot of the earlier and more fun ones.
[2:38:31] <%cowardman93> fair dude, keep up the work
[2:38:33] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @cowardman93 oh no. Did our friendos die?
[2:38:33] <%Guardiansaiyan> @StridentSong where is pat right now?
[2:38:36] <@SoFarFetched> bathroom
[2:38:36] <%tigerfang86> @fenrirlives I want some gunslinger ass gunplay but then Vincent can devil trigger to go full melee beast mode
[2:38:37] <%Solid_Stro> @garbagequeenellie Spoilers. We’re not there yet
[2:38:37] <%axiomthunder> @StridentSong i love you
[2:38:45] <%JumbleJams> remember when sephiroh wears a pretty dress and breakdances?
[2:38:45] <@StridentSong> @Guardiansaiyan Plate just fell
[2:38:48] <%Guardiansaiyan> @SoFarFetched I meant in game...unless its also the bathroom
[2:38:57] <@SoFarFetched> Pat needs to take his natural piss break and show how hard he needs to pee.
[2:38:58] <%KawaiiJetty> Yeah at least it's not 15k or such
[2:38:59] <%Fenrirlives> @tigerfang86 hell yeah!
[2:39:00] <%Guardiansaiyan> @StridentSong he is litterally outside by the crash?
[2:39:09] <@StridentSong> No, he's at Aerith's house
[2:39:13] <%Guardiansaiyan> ooh
[2:39:14] <%Guardiansaiyan> aw
[2:39:18] <%Guardiansaiyan> I missed wall market
[2:39:19] <%CaptainBright> @StridentSong At least this ain't Max's stream chat yet; yikes
[2:39:23] <%ringabal> I can actually read the chat without having to speedread
[2:39:23] <@StridentSong> All the flashbacks just happened
[2:39:23] <%amused_platypus> any vincent is better than dirge vincent
[2:39:24] <%Hellarussian> remember when Cloud shits his pants all over?
[2:39:28] <%Dragon_Batman> @TurtlesAndTentacles God the places they can go, I'm excited and scared at the same time. Hell, I'm just at the end of the next chapter and oo boy
[2:39:28] <%Legato_Ambrose> He didn't spend much time in Wall Market tho
[2:39:33] <%Legato_Ambrose> Didn't miss much
[2:39:36] <%QuadraticGravity> Max's stream chat is being handled really well. People have NO tact.
[2:39:37] <@SoFarFetched> Max's chat is definitely on a different dynamic compared to this chat.
[2:39:38] <%axiomthunder> gonna cry? gonna shit and cum?
[2:39:38] <%heartlesshealer> @Guardiansaiyan Pat didn't even look at Wall Market post-plate
[2:39:43] <%Guardiansaiyan> @CaptainBright thats anightmare...people don't behave like US
[2:39:46] <@StridentSong> I don't envy Max. He's been looking forward to this for so long, and his chat size means it has to be a nightmare to keep up with. His mods really are gods
[2:39:46] <%Robot_Nixon_> Maybe we'll finally find out how BugenHagen floats
[2:39:46] <%cowardman93> @Hellarussian which time? He kinda shits his pants every few hours
[2:39:59] <%Guardiansaiyan> @heartlesshealer that sucks...I wanted him to talk to people
[2:40:06] <%Dragon_Batman> Yea seeing Max's stream and the numbers, wow
[2:40:07] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> @Dragon_Batman I'm freaking out about how great and how bad its gonna get me
[2:40:07] <%Zombrocom> Max is averageing 25K it's nuts
[2:40:08] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> To be fair, Max's chat is also like 10k huge
[2:40:08] <%Aracon_> max's chat is nightmarish purely on size alone
[2:40:10] <%GarbageQueenEllie> That shot with the kitties made me sad. Good thing I got a kitty with me
[2:40:11] <%televisedrevolting> Remember that time Cloud totally beefed it.
[2:40:14] <%Guardiansaiyan> @StridentSong I just say for max to emote only till done
[2:40:18] <%JumbleJams> shit your pants so hard another plate comes down
[2:40:22] <%Aracon_> and all the gift subs given out on like every stream just makes it even bigger
[2:40:22] <%tigerfang86> @this_is_marco I hope he uses a MAGIC ORB
[2:40:22] <@SoFarFetched> Max's mod's are probably just clones of Strident.
[2:40:24] <%Aydarkzero> remember that time Cloud used a sword Kappa
[2:40:30] <%odinthepirate> did pat have to go shit?
[2:40:31] <%Guardiansaiyan> @SoFarFetched truth
[2:40:32] <%heartlesshealer> @Guardiansaiyan Same, wanted to know if Chadley was there since Pat just finished his last battle quest thingies on the tower
[2:40:34] <%Solid_Stro> I want Vincent’s dialogue to be only quotes from the goth kids in South Park
[2:40:36] <%goose_attack_almanac> Dear God Farfetched
[2:40:37] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> @SoFarFetched You arent wrong. They ban heavily.
[2:40:39] <%ringabal> I can't believe Cloud's gonna have to kill Canon God Nomura
[2:40:43] <%sund0wner> Yeah I can't go into Max's streams anymore, pure and total chaos
[2:40:44] <@StridentSong> Max's mods are keeping up with the chat, and that's incredibly impressive
[2:40:44] <%QuadraticGravity> They're told "Don't backseat or tell me hints or spoil shit." And after sub-only mode they're STILL having to constantly blast people.
[2:40:44] <%goose_attack_almanac> There isn't enough Samus for such a horde
[2:40:45] <%Hellarussian> @cowardman93 they were all necessary for his pants' character development
[2:40:49] <%Dragon_Batman> @TurtlesAndTentacles In due time
[2:40:52] <%Aydarkzero> @Solid_Stro So V from dmcv?
[2:40:55] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @Solid_Stro And now I want this LUL
[2:40:57] <Kain5707> @StridentSong they turn on emote only chat a lot, im watching his VOD now and every boss fight/story segment is emote only and i dont blame them at all
[2:41:04] <%KawaiiJetty> Pat practicing his bathroom skills
[2:41:05] <%Robot_Nixon_> @tigerfang86 I'll take any anything really
[2:41:11] <%sund0wner> Smart
[2:41:14] <%GarbageQueenEllie> I wonder how they're gonna introduce Bort when the time comes
[2:41:14] <@SoFarFetched> I assume from a lot of backseating during the fights.
[2:41:15] <%Dragon_Batman> Max is very fortunate too he does have a good number of mods as well
[2:41:16] <%Solid_Stro> Vincent “Life is pain, life is only pain...”
[2:41:19] <%axiomthunder> we should all just go emote only
[2:41:24] <%heartlesshealer> On the fly switching is pretty good too
[2:41:33] <%SummonerMagno> Is Pat dumping all the paint??
[2:41:34] <%TheMattman1313> Don't worry guys Pat is just putting all of his clothes back on.
[2:41:35] <%Aydarkzero> emote only is funny
[2:41:37] <%ringabal> Vincent should just carry a poetry book labelled "V"
[2:41:38] <Kain5707> a lot of backseating all the time lol
[2:41:42] <%Guardiansaiyan> PSN has Journey for free till May...just saying
[2:41:43] <%heartlesshealer> I personally don't mind emote only. I was screaming for it just before the colosseum fights
[2:41:45] <%cowardman93> Pat is weighing himself right now
[2:41:45] <@StridentSong> We're not going emote only unless necessary. For the most part, you guys behave yourselves
[2:41:48] <%QuadraticGravity> @SoFarFetched it's unbelievable, just CONSTANT streams of "TRY X", "YOU CAN Y"
[2:41:50] <%Fenrirlives> @stridentsong can you whisper me how many hours till RedXIII?
[2:41:53] <@SoFarFetched> Strident will make the decision when need be for emote mode. But for now you guys get talking for now.....as a treat.
[2:41:56] <%jessedouglas> how many mods does max have? they are all pretty impressive with his ff7 streams
[2:41:56] <%JumbleJams> how many emotes does it take to spoil a game? hint: get creative
[2:41:57] <%mechslayer71> Which version of FF7 original should I play? Are they any that have update models so they aren’t pure Popeye?
[2:41:59] <%Solid_Stro> Cloud “What kinda soda do you like, Vincent?” Vincent “Suffering.”
[2:41:59] <%pynkdoe> what if vincent is just v from dmc
[2:41:59] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Vincent is the epitome of "Why are we here? Is it just to suffer?"
[2:42:00] <@StridentSong> And the ones that don't get hammered into the shadowrealm
[2:42:00] <%Aydarkzero> @Guardiansaiyan good looking out, never played it before
[2:42:06] <%GarbageQueenEllie> You're not my REAL mom! I can do whatever I want! lalalalalala
[2:42:20] <%Guardiansaiyan> @Aydarkzero I downloaded it...only 4 GB so its doable to play
[2:42:20] <%Robot_Nixon_> calebJ 👎 To the shadow realm
[2:42:23] <%zanzibar_junker> a fuckton of sidequests are gonna open Soo
[2:42:24] <%tigerfang86> yeah I think except for some ONE GUYS
[2:42:27] <%cowardman93> just remember strident is always watching and will shoot without hesitation
[2:42:27] <%tigerfang86> the chat is fibe
[2:42:30] <%NitronStreams> Shinra played us like a goddamn fiddle.
[2:42:32] <%Guardiansaiyan> ONE GUY
[2:42:37] <%Aydarkzero> How strong is one guy chat monkaS
[2:42:40] <%cowardman93> ALL FOR REVENGE
[2:42:41] <%axiomthunder> @StridentSong have the mods spoiled themselves so they know who to ban for spoilers
[2:42:41] <%ringabal> Vincent: "I knew I should've stayed in the coffin today..."
[2:42:42] <%amiroodude> Did pat fall in the toilet again?
[2:42:43] <@SoFarFetched> @QuadraticGravity It's why in here,we had to start timeouting people for backseating because it started getting out of hand.
[2:42:43] <%Dragon_Batman> Oh man Chp 14 is pretty great for how open it feels
[2:42:45] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> I hope Strident shoots me
[2:42:47] <%coffeeabomination> The Chat is Shinra
[2:42:50] <%Guardiansaiyan> @Aydarkzero almost as strong as Sephy Bishi EDGY
[2:42:53] <%furiousfurioso> the streams I've seen the chat just starts to dissolve into madness towards the end, I wonder if we can be good enough
[2:42:57] <%Aydarkzero> Too strong monkaS
[2:42:59] <%tigerfang86> psa3guy
[2:42:59] <@StridentSong> @axiomthunder I already beat the game, so I know what I"m looking for
[2:43:02] <%SvenHolgersson> Pat fell in call the cops
[2:43:03] <%pynkdoe> jermaOneguy has infinte power
[2:43:06] <%axiomthunder> coool, good
[2:43:09] <%JumbleJams> this chat is already mad
[2:43:11] <%BonewheelVanguard> Has the package guy struck again...
[2:43:13] <%Guardiansaiyan> Did the Mods ban Aerith for spoilers yet?
[2:43:15] <%jessedouglas> @stridentsong that's smart
[2:43:15] <@StridentSong> and Paige has spoiled herself so she can keep an eye out as well
[2:43:17] <%NopeBadguy> What ch is Pat currently on rn?
[2:43:19] <Kain5707> jermaOneguy
[2:43:21] <%Legato_Ambrose> Genuinely worried delivery man has struck again
[2:43:33] <%Solid_Stro> When Vincent is introduced in the Part 2, Gackt “Redemption” plays
[2:43:36] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Aerith should really be banned. She told me how the whole game ends
[2:43:37] <%EuropanLamprey> Nah, it's just that it's canon that Pat won't return to the stream for 15 minutes and he's being attacked by Time Ghosts on the toilet as we speak
[2:43:38] <%Campfire_Chronicles> @nopebadguy plate just came down
[2:43:38] <%mechslayer71> What version of FF7 original should I get @chat? Is there a version that has updated models so I don’t have to deal with the Popeye shit? @chat
[2:43:38] <%Zombrocom> Delivery man is truely the One Guy
[2:43:40] <%KawaiiJetty> Honestly happy how smooth it went during the tower section
[2:43:42] <%heartlesshealer> Yeah, Paige is keeping her ears on the chat now that Honeybee Inn is done
[2:43:45] <%Valdorick> I spoiled myself just to not make some dumbass joke that lands into spoiler town by mistake.
[2:43:51] <Kain5707> have any of the mods completed this game yet?
[2:43:51] <%JumbleJams> call in the purrell strike
[2:43:53] <%dashmatt> I wonder if delivery man got in trouble the other week

[2:46:59] <%Zombrocom> Axiom on a one man quest to free the chat
[2:47:04] <%heartlesshealer> No one answer that
[2:47:06] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @GarbageQueenEllie yes
[2:47:10] <%axiomthunder> @Piemen99 shhhh
[2:47:12] <%Guardiansaiyan> @King_Wolf_Rigger as it shouldn't
[2:47:13] <%Piemen99> Dm me the answer
[2:47:20] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @Guardiansaiyan I'll have to ask Tifa, but it should be good
[2:47:20] <%floralkami> @mechslayer71 I mentioned checking out the "New Threat" mod that Maximilian Dood showed off for a playthrough, but making sure you can get a version that doesn't include the new story beats (apparently there is a version that has new fanmade story content for vets to enjoy a whole new playthrough)
[2:47:21] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Man Barret owned that last scene. Give the man an Oscar
[2:47:21] <%Legato_Ambrose> I see the red materia there, yes
[2:47:23] <%valkuma> i like Heal Magnify more
[2:47:28] <%ringabal> Barret with the Thuggery build
[2:47:30] <%JumbleJams> sirfetch got me in early thanks man
[2:47:30] <%Aydarkzero> that sounds like a really strong build
[2:47:31] <%Treuan> psaBig psaUp
[2:47:32] <%Tearonex> Barret the TANK
[2:47:32] <%myriad_truth> Barrett can get stupid tanky
[2:47:34] <%heartlesshealer> Barret the Paladin
[2:47:37] <%Aeoneth> Champion Belt gives 10% HPs
[2:47:38] <%EuropanLamprey> Berret's a powerful Gun Cleric
[2:47:40] <%MakotoPB> Barret Paladin build
[2:47:40] <%Fenrirlives> No Prob!
[2:47:40] <%Zombrocom> Immortal God King Barret
[2:47:42] <%neroforte177> TANK DAT MF
[2:47:42] <%NopeBadguy> how is it that they actually managed to make tank Barret effective in this game
[2:47:43] <%cowardman93> Barret is the definition of TANK
[2:47:45] <%tigerfang86> barrett has BEEF
[2:47:49] <%coreyyotto> Barret is basically a Sentinel
[2:47:49] <%mechslayer71> @floralkami cool. But it’ll just run on anything?
[2:47:49] <%CaptainBright> Make Barret extra CHONK
[2:47:51] <%tigerfang86> hes got HUGE BEEF
[2:47:54] <%KawaiiJetty> Barret is psaBig dad power
[2:47:54] <%iosephe> thicc barret
[2:47:57] <%Aydarkzero> Dad Energy Buffs monkaS
[2:48:02] <%coreyyotto> Also helps to give him Provoke
[2:48:03] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> I was watching Max get the Champion belt, shit's wild.
[2:48:04] <%RetroCop87> HP Barret build becomes more viable with upcoming equipment
[2:48:06] <%heartlesshealer> does strength percentage help with bullets?
[2:48:11] <%myriad_truth> But Barret doesn't need the strength buff
[2:48:14] <%Capta1n_H3nry> Paladin with GUN
[2:48:16] <%Nupinoop296> chaotic good paladin
[2:48:19] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> GUNADIN
[2:48:23] <%Aydarkzero> thisy class is unfamiliar to me Kappa
[2:48:25] <%Daskolin> GUNLADIN
[2:48:26] <%VHGS> @heartlesshealer yes. You can't see it but he's actually throwing the bullets really hard.
[2:48:29] <%coffeeabomination> I dunno man Paladin is hard damage with that smite
[2:48:29] <%gaomachine> Barret's also got some reload cancel tech with charge where you can use it to cancel the reload animation from his normal attack and get both benefits at once.
[2:48:29] <%tigerfang86> PALAGUN
[2:48:34] <%tigerfang86> cmon people
[2:48:34] <%NopeBadguy> barrets more of a straight warrior whereas cloud is a dark knight
[2:48:34] <%mechslayer71> He can tank up later @patstaresat
[2:48:36] <%WhereIsWill> Barret is a Gundam lol
[2:48:37] <%Yummy_Nukes> doodDerp doodSweet doodRage
[2:48:38] <%heartlesshealer> @VHGS Awesome
[2:48:38] <%Aeoneth> I think Tifa is the strongest choice for steal
[2:48:41] <%Ynkubus18> Hes a paladin of that greyhawk cowboy god
[2:48:44] <%floralkami> @mechslayer71 it should, the PS1 didn't require that much juice to run, and it's usually a go to for emulation tests
[2:48:46] <%FatherGreyBeard> that's a thing in pathfinder
[2:48:47] <Kain5707> dilly dally shilly shally
[2:48:48] <%NitronStreams> Tifffffuh
[2:48:48] <%myriad_truth> Tifa is a GLASS CANNON

[2:49:43] <%Japanfreak2595> See the thing I really want them to do is let people transfer their shit between games. Let me keep my materia.

[2:52:02] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Absolute Unit
[2:52:03] <%ringabal> He's BARRETCADDING the way!
[2:52:07] <%spiritofmojave> HE MOST BLOCC
[2:52:08] <%optimasmaximas> @zetastriker wait what?
[2:52:10] <%coffeeabomination> Barret the Wall of HIMBO
[2:52:10] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Barret reminds me of Ronnie Coleman. YEAH BUDDY! LIGHTWEIGHT!
[2:52:11] <%Alazull> These guys have got to be tired as fuck
[2:52:11] <%mechslayer71> @zetastriker If you get caught she comes out of here room
[2:52:12] <%heartlesshealer> maybe turn the X into chakra or prayer?
[2:52:17] <%Solid_Stro> Barret’s hands are literally the size of Cloud’s face
[2:52:20] <%CelioHogane> @zetastriker no she couldn't you see her leave her room if Cloud fucks up
[2:52:21] <%Aracon_> ???
[2:52:23] <%heartlesshealer> Oh! Full rework now
[2:52:26] <%myriad_truth> Barret looks better without the sunglasses
[2:52:30] <%Aracon_> oh
[2:52:31] <%Aydarkzero> it's weird but i don't use shotcuts that often
[2:52:35] <%Alazull> Barret is built like a shit brickhouse
[2:52:35] <%zetastriker> Oh really? I must've misremembered what door it was. I like it better with the balcony though, it's funnier that way
[2:52:37] <%NitronStreams> @solid_stro hand* singular
[2:52:41] <%Dragon_Batman> I made shure to have stagger ups as triangle for everyone
[2:52:47] <%rufus2k2> I like Char Barret
[2:52:49] <%NopeBadguy> Disorder isn't worth the ATB bar imo
[2:52:52] <%코코꾸라> beep beep
[2:52:52] <%Solid_Stro> @nitronstreams Ah touché
[2:52:53] <%ringabal> Always keep the Stinger
[2:52:54] <%Aydarkzero> Triple Slash is MAD GOOD
[2:53:00] <%rufus2k2> Quattro Barretjina
[2:53:01] <%Aeoneth> You can get a new one soon
[2:53:03] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Asses to Asses
[2:53:04] <%DeoxysPrime> Asses
[2:53:06] <%Aracon_> really no disorder?
[2:53:07] <%myriad_truth> I found Disorder to work really well on bosses
[2:53:13] <%Solid_Stro> Million Stab?
[2:53:14] <%mechslayer71> You’re either a chad or a cuck in this game, no inbetween. Wedge is the dad bod chad
[2:53:15] <%ringabal> psaGoblin
[2:53:21] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @Alazull You should look up Ronnie Coleman. Basically a real life Barret.
[2:53:21] <%Dragon_Batman> Disorder works only on quick select just to use punisher and switch freely really
[2:53:22] <%Japanfreak2595> Cloud’s Stinger
[2:53:29] <%heartlesshealer> Prayer?
[2:53:34] <%heartlesshealer> okay
[2:53:35] <%Aracon_> disorder is reeeeeal good on the shortcut
[2:53:38] <%valkuma> you can use all of them with the X menu
[2:53:44] <%Scarnehu> prey
[2:53:50] <%myriad_truth> Overpower is really good
[2:53:50] <%Dragon_Batman> Focus is the stinger for her
[2:53:55] <%zetastriker> Yeah, screw Divekick
[2:53:55] <%mechslayer71> He gets a reallly good ability with his next gun @patstaresat
[2:53:57] <%rufus2k2> Ronnie is Biscuit Olivia from Baki
[2:53:58] <%Aydarkzero> starshower + divekick is my favorite follow up
[2:53:59] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Young Aerith Mom tho Kreygasm
[2:54:00] <%Dragon_Batman> In terms of usage
[2:54:01] <%valkuma> a LONG time
[2:54:01] <%Aeoneth> Overpower just puts preople into pressured state more easily
[2:54:02] <%ringabal> KH2
[2:54:02] <%Aydarkzero> KH2
[2:54:02] <%Koush> Since FF7

[2:56:30] <%Buzzard42> Seph is desperate for us to fuck up the plot so he doesn't get Omnislashed into oblivion
[2:56:31] <%zetastriker> If Sephiroth was gonna change something, he should've shown up in a dress for Don Corneo
[2:56:31] <%cowardman93> Fuck assed: sponsored by Square-enix
[2:56:32] <%heartlesshealer> no
[2:56:33] <%Nobrev> maybe that's why the plot ghosts keep fucking with aerith. because she knows the bad things are happening and wants them to not
[2:56:33] <%aishman> @PatStaresAt So they both want to change fate, one for the better and one for the worst. It's literally "Could be you Angel or your DEBIL"

[2:58:30] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @TurtlesAndTentacles I just wished I liked the show, but man the pacing and refusal to give the characters any growth and the fact that Goku has to be the one is just kinda boring sadly.
[2:58:32] <%tusk102> avalanche time
[2:58:32] <%weissguard> Now that's a bonkin' battle theme.
[2:58:33] <%myriad_truth> Yeah I never played the orginal FF7

[2:58:35] <%Ancopro> oho
[2:58:37] <%ShichiNoBushi> For until just about the end of this game, I expect.
[2:58:41] <%Explodincatz> unless they change it
[2:58:41] <%NopeBadguy> cloud was honestly on caster duty for a lot of the game as a result
[2:58:43] <%NitronStreams> CBT: Cloud Barret Tifa
[2:58:43] <%SvenHolgersson> Which is a REAL downside to this game
[2:58:46] <%imthewisejanitor> In a way, some of the alterations are more "clarificatons" than they are changes.

[3:00:32] <%Yummy_Nukes> @patstaresat just fight ass in the Coliseum
[3:00:36] <%BallerSwagBro9k> SourPls
[3:00:37] <%CelioHogane> @myriad_truth it's Cait Sith
[3:00:37] <%Jungos60> Due Recompense! \ o /
[3:00:39] <%Aeoneth> Vargid Police!
[3:00:39] <%Aydarkzero> this feels like a better Groose theme for some reason LUL
[3:00:43] <%Aracon_> Due Recompense is officially the MVP track in this game
[3:00:45] <%Fenrirlives> is the ost released yet?
[3:00:45] <%SH1NK1R0> @Buzzard42 technically yes but thats a spoiler
[3:00:45] <%heartlesshealer> manufactured monsters
[3:00:46] <%Axellogic> I wish it was still the Wall Market theme
[3:00:50] <%Guardiansaiyan> CAIT SITH MAIN
[3:00:55] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> Do wreck em pants?
[3:00:56] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @arancet "I'll fucking fight your ass" I think that works
[3:00:56] <%tigerfang86> THESE weirdoes
[3:00:58] <%luftraumm1> they have an E.Skill
[3:00:59] <%Tearonex> I remember them as the evil carrots
[3:00:59] <%maenos2> What is the name of this track?
[3:01:03] <%heartlesshealer> AP gained
[3:01:08] <%Daskolin> The JENOVA carrots???
[3:01:12] <%PadreHail> Due Recompense is the track
[3:01:13] <%Aracon_> @maenos2 due recompense
[3:01:14] <%Guardiansaiyan> @Manjove Beck remix hardass
[3:01:15] <%DougintheTrench> @Aydarkzero Might be because of the Godhand Groose Gang that showed up here earlier.
[3:01:22] <%Dragon_Batman> Cuz it's sooo good
[3:01:25] <%ShichiNoBushi> Will Cait Sith's Limits still be based on dice?
[3:01:28] <%Legato_Ambrose> Really knocked it outta the park
[3:01:30] <%stuntdoublejesus> $77 bw
[3:01:31] <%Solid_Stro> The music makes me think they’re gonna run into Jin and Hasashi
[3:01:31] <%Aydarkzero> yeah the ost is honestly amazing
[3:01:32] <%PocketChange117> Everything in this game is a bop
[3:01:32] <%코코꾸라> It's also 7 CDs
[3:01:32] <%arancet> @King_Wolf_Rigger but you inserted another word in the middle!
[3:01:32] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> the music FUCKS
[3:01:36] <%VHGS> seven discs of back to back BANGERS
[3:01:37] <%Manjove> why @ me tho
[3:01:39] <%optimasmaximas> i have a "mini-soundtrack" that comes with the physical delxue edition
[3:01:40] <%weissguard> SourPls
[3:01:41] <%JumbleJams> yooo this track
[3:01:43] <%Guardiansaiyan> @ShichiNoBushi I want it based on employee raises
[3:01:44] <%maenos2> Thanks folks
[3:01:44] <%ratreborn> those Varghidoplis are hittin it to this track did u see them
[3:01:46] <%cowardman93> the soundtrack is dope
[3:01:46] <%Zombrocom> They sure did kill the music
[3:01:47] <%Aydarkzero> a few of them even had 13 vibes to them which was nice
[3:01:49] <%luketrapwalker> This soundtrack is definitely a top 10 album for this year, for sure.
[3:01:50] <%DeoxysPrime> Seen quite a few people disappointed with the soundtrack which is crazy to me
[3:01:51] <%MoraMiarty> so is magnify just this games "ALL"?
[3:01:51] <%Aracon_> I hope cait sith is actually useful this time around
[3:01:52] <%Sir_stride> if this doesnt win best music at the game awards, im suing
[3:01:53] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @stuntdoublejesus SHUT UP REALLY? For an OST NotLikeThis
[3:01:54] <%stuntdoublejesus> cost more than the game
[3:01:56] <%Solid_Stro> May 28th can’t come sooner doodOuch
[3:02:01] <%mechslayer71> Pats coming up on the best song soon enough Kreygasm @patstaresat
[3:02:07] <%heartlesshealer> You wandered too far out of the hex it seems
[3:02:13] <@StridentSong> @MoraMiarty Magnify is now "Some" instead of "All"
[3:02:19] <%PadreHail> If the Game Awards even come this year sbfpPatschwitz
[3:02:24] <%KasiCrafter> Combat's great, but sometimes the camera needs HELP.
[3:02:28] <%valkuma> Tifa is my favorite
[3:02:30] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @arancet Ah I see, I must use them without other words.
[3:02:30] <%ratreborn> Tifa is straight up the strongest character in the game, holy shit
[3:02:33] <%Aracon_> playing as tifa is super fun
[3:02:35] <%Aydarkzero> Game Awards in 2020 tripleW
[3:02:37] <%stuntdoublejesus> @BallerSwagBro9k yes its only physical copy atm as well
[3:02:39] <%cowardman93> I think it's safe to say all major gatherings this year are cancelled
[3:02:39] <%CelioHogane> Okay, so im certain there will be NEW party members, because it's likelly that part 2 has 3 (or 4, if Vincent), so Part 3 would have only one or two remaining, and that's kinda low.
[3:02:39] <%Dragon_Batman> Yea, would have been a bummer if any weren't good
[3:02:42] <%Xenokhrist> put the parry materia on Tifa and it's almost a stylish action game
[3:02:43] <%Verd_254> Tifa is just a tekken character in this game
[3:02:45] <%Axellogic> I agree with the camera statement
[3:02:46] <%KawaiiJetty> I love Barret's Overcharge
[3:02:48] <%luftraumm1> MNKs represent!!!
[3:02:48] <%pynkdoe> game awards in 2020 LUL
[3:02:49] <%PocketChange117> Is it auto-attacky or is each hit its own input?
[3:02:51] <%Aydarkzero> Tifa is just Godhand gameplay LUL
[3:02:54] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @PadreHail If this shit hasnt blown over by December BOI
[3:02:54] <%mechslayer71> Barret is such a fun tank/ sustain damage character
[3:02:55] <%PadreHail> You can do some legit fuckin combos with Tifa
[3:02:56] <%Aracon_> especially with the way her abilities work you can get some long ass combos
[3:02:57] <%floralkami> @ratreborn she is a glass cannon
[3:03:01] <%Axellogic> Why does locking on to somone glue the camera inside the wall
[3:03:02] <%Solid_Stro> When Tifa is full super sayan her moves are god killing
[3:03:03] <%Aeoneth> @KasiCrafter If you are playing it, I've found switching to Free camera track and changing the lockon switch to Dpad helps A LOT
[3:03:04] <%heartlesshealer> Oh these guys are here
[3:03:05] <%UvBenServed> Oh man, Game Awards just being an hour long livestream in Geoff Keighley's house
[3:03:05] <%DeoxysPrime> ROBITS
[3:03:05] <%ringabal> they vibin
[3:03:08] <%PadreHail> Like Starshower is a fucking combo ender
[3:03:08] <%cutecheeks> I'd take tifa character action game!
[3:03:19] <%Aracon_> couple all that with purple pain and hggGasm
[3:03:23] <%NopeBadguy> tifa feels like 14's monk in an action game, build all your stacks then blow them
[3:03:25] <%floralkami> @axellogic 3D cameras are hard, my guy
[3:03:28] <%CelioHogane> @cutecheeks it's called this game
[3:03:31] <%DougintheTrench> Man, I love how the music shifts from one track to another's.
[3:03:34] <%myriad_truth> Robots hate lightning. Go figure...
[3:03:36] <%mechslayer71> @padrehail It’s actually a combo starter, subsequent abilities do more damage
[3:03:37] <%mield916> psaDab psaDab psaDab psaDab
[3:03:40] <%Dragon_Batman> @CelioHogane Depending how they do it, they could add the rest in 2 and in 3 everyone is around and you have free choice
[3:03:42] <%Solid_Stro> Wonder if Vincent is basically going to play like Dante Gunslinger
[3:03:45] <%PocketChange117> @NopeBadguy blow them, you say? lol
[3:03:49] <%rufus2k2> I can't wait to see the other characters in the sequel, Yuffie will be a nuts as fuck Ninja
[3:03:50] <%luftraumm1> is Cloud a Dark Knight?
[3:03:57] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> I'm heavily beating that Starshower is gonna be a new MNK AOE in the next FFXIV expansion
[3:04:01] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> *betting
[3:04:04] <%PadreHail> I thought that was only Overpower that gives you subsequent damage
[3:04:10] <%myriad_truth> PUNCH HIM IN THE BUTT!
[3:04:10] <%Scarnehu> steal
[3:04:10] <%stuntdoublejesus> all yall forgettin my man cid
[3:04:13] <%KawaiiJetty> Vincent playing a hybrid style from Dirge
[3:04:17] <%Axellogic> @floralkami but why is camera not facing thing I lock onto its more interested in the wall
[3:04:18] <%NopeBadguy> @pocketchange117 well, blow chakras in 14, blows stacks here on stagger
[3:04:20] <%PadreHail> I mean I chain pretty much all her stuff
[3:04:21] <%spiritofmojave> @luftraumm1 yep, even the idle stance for DRK's in FF14 is his pose
[3:04:23] <%Aydarkzero> wonder how Yuffie will play
[3:04:23] <%Aeoneth> I'm hoping they let us use all characters, even if we can only issue commands to 3 of them
[3:04:24] <%CelioHogane> @Dragon_Batman if they didn't add Red XII in this game, i doubt they are going to add 5 on the next one.
[3:04:28] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @luftraumm1 The victory pose for Dark Knight is based on Cloud's victory pose, so it's the other way around, but yes.
[3:04:32] <%PadreHail> Yuffie will be ranged as fuck
[3:04:33] <%realm_forge> The sweeper has an adorable little poop canister on it’s butt
[3:04:34] <%mechslayer71> @padrehail nope, in fact the challenge for starshower is to follow up with other abilities
[3:04:35] <@StridentSong> Cid is gonna play like Lu Bu in a Dynasty Warriors game
[3:04:36] <%Legato_Ambrose> @stuntdoublejesus Nah, I'm sittin' here wondering how they'll "modernize" him to be less of a sexist asshole
[3:04:42] <%MakotoPB> When I see Tifa do those spinning kicks in my mind I can hear "Try this on for size!"
[3:04:47] <%Xenokhrist> double Unbridled Strength into Starshower into Triangle moves flattens everyone
[3:04:48] <%Axellogic> Yuffie is prolly gonna be ranged
[3:04:56] <%Aracon_> I can't wait to kill enemies from across the map with yuffie
[3:05:01] <%luftraumm1> @spiritofmojave yeah in 14 its the best, wish there was more influence here, maybe even a darkside
[3:05:01] <%NopeBadguy> @padrehail unbridled strength stacks gives a buff to normals and change your triangle, overpower buffs normals, starshower buffs abilities
[3:05:03] <%heartlesshealer> Yuffie had a boomerang or something, right?
[3:05:09] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @rufus2k2 Im eager to see how they make Cid cuz.......hes quite a character LUL
[3:05:10] <%rufus2k2> giant shuriken
[3:05:14] <%Axellogic> She had a gigantic shurken
[3:05:17] <%Ascethetic> Red will play like Ammy in Okami, in a sense
[3:05:18] <%Hellarussian> Cid will use his wife as a weapon
[3:05:19] <%tigerfang86> big shuriken
[3:05:19] <%zeif00> Will Vincent have a devil trigger?
[3:05:20] <%Jungos60> A big ass Shuriken
[3:05:20] <%Legato_Ambrose> I think one of her weapons was a boomerang though
[3:05:21] <%cowardman93> I can see Yuffie being introduced in the mines
[3:05:22] <%valkuma> Barrets melee weapons are hilarious
[3:05:22] <%CelioHogane> @Axellogic Nah, Yuffie will probably the character that you can switch between range and melee, like how cloud goes from light to heavy.
[3:05:22] <%BallerSwagBro9k> WIND RASEN SHURICKEN
[3:05:27] <%ratreborn> Vincent should play exactly like in Dirge
[3:05:28] <%Solid_Stro> Cid is gonna curse in every sentence ever
[3:05:28] <%myriad_truth> BELIEVE IT
[3:05:29] <%ratreborn> lmao
[3:05:29] <%Dragovus> She's a Naruto
[3:05:33] <%PocketChange117> Damn there's 1600 people watching, crazy
[3:05:33] <%pynkdoe> how do you think theyll do the open world chat?
[3:05:35] <%ShichiNoBushi> Shuri cans?
[3:05:35] <%Aydarkzero> @Hellarussian ah an early look to his ultima weapon LUL
[3:05:36] <%Aracon_> hmmmm
[3:05:38] <%Keyd00d> FeelsBadMan
[3:05:38] <%spiritofmojave> @luftraumm1 that'd be pretty gooood, wouldn't surprise me to have more 14 elements in
[3:05:40] <%Nupinoop296> too real :(
[3:05:40] <%NopeBadguy> just replace Cid's spear with a giant cigarette
[3:05:40] <%UvBenServed> oof
[3:05:42] <%Yummy_Nukes> shurrycans
[3:05:43] <%KawaiiJetty> Based on Kingdom Hearts, Yuffie would be mixed which i wouldn't mind it
[3:05:44] <%Buzzard42> FeelsBadMan
[3:05:47] <%Aydarkzero> this game is too real sometimes...
[3:05:48] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> I bet Yuffie will function like FFXIV Dancer
[3:05:48] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt cids spear will be his wife
[3:05:48] <%ringabal> More of a Boruto, really
[3:05:51] <%PadreHail> Ah that's right, I think I literally already knew that when I was playing but I beat the game like 4 days ago and completely forgot she has so much shit
[3:05:53] <%CelioHogane> I want to see how CAIT SITH is going to play
[3:05:56] <%aslfrasle> GIVE YUFFIE MUDRAS
[3:05:58] <%Axellogic> I wonder if they'll keeep her weird arm thing and leg brace
[3:05:58] <%Mr_Pylon> Pretty interested to se how Red plays
[3:06:04] <%rufus2k2> goddamn human enemies are paper
[3:06:06] <%Aydarkzero> @CelioHogane DnD rolls that kill you LUL
[3:06:07] <%RAAAAAINMAKER> She'll have Ibuki V-trigger set ups
[3:06:08] <%Nupinoop296> i love them
[3:06:08] <%zanzibar_junker> murder
[3:06:09] <%stuntdoublejesus> isnt yuffie like 16 or something?
[3:06:10] <%Fenrirlives> Oh yeah does Barrett still have the wierd punch gun?
[3:06:12] <%rufus2k2> unless they're shinra mooks
[3:06:12] <%PadreHail> Red is gonna be a fuckin Berserker
[3:06:16] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @PocketChange117 Pats record is + tho5K
[3:06:18] <%VHGS> @stuntdoublejesus she sure is
[3:06:18] <%myriad_truth> I was Marlenes age when the original came up
[3:06:19] <%Hellarussian> a little bit
[3:06:21] <%ratreborn> try and max out each green materia
[3:06:21] <%CelioHogane> @Mr_Pylon i mean, you will able to see it in this game, just not control him.
[3:06:22] <%mechslayer71> @mr_pylon are you currently playing the game?
[3:06:25] <%spiritofmojave> @stuntdoublejesus pretty much
[3:06:25] <%ringabal> Remember when Pat named Yuffie Bolt? Fun times
[3:06:25] <%luftraumm1> @spiritofmojave imagine the next game gives you R1+L1 commands so you can manage the whole party
[3:06:26] <%KasiCrafter> Probably.
[3:06:27] <%heartlesshealer> What does Breach even do?
[3:06:29] <%rufus2k2> @Fenrirlives pretty sure he has all his melee weapons yeah
[3:06:30] <%Solid_Stro> Cid’s ATB gauge only fills when he’s cursing in battle
[3:06:32] <+mgs09> mgs09 subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[3:06:34] <%SvenHolgersson> Do you get outfits later on or is this basically the only looks you're getting
[3:06:34] <%floralkami> @axellogic sometimes the camera can freak out a bit when either going between too many movements and enemies (like with the ghosts and flying enemies) or in smaller areas/hall wugging corners while moving fast. it's a common problem in 3D games with a free moving cam
[3:06:35] <%Daskolin> Bandits be like "Let`s fight that big man with GUNARM"
[3:06:35] <%bread_assassin> You wanna max all magics.
[3:06:37] <%trustycoyote> Wouldn't leveling up, right?
[3:06:38] <%Yummy_Nukes> AWWW CLOUD AND BARRET ARE BONDING doodThirst doodThirst doodThirst doodThirst
[3:06:38] <%Metballs> Breach deletes shields
[3:06:40] <%heartlesshealer> Is Subversion materia applying debuffs?
[3:06:44] <%PadreHail> Breach removes mana and physical shields
[3:06:46] <%stuntdoublejesus> i want clumbo back. fuck cloud
[3:06:47] <%heartlesshealer> Oh nice @Metballs
[3:06:47] <%PhantomMiG> Cloud seems to be more a person with Barrett now
[3:06:48] <%Aydarkzero> @Solid_Stro R.Mika meter build
[3:06:48] <%myriad_truth> Give Barret that HP up
[3:06:48] <%trustycoyote> wouldnt hurt leveling them up meant to say
[3:06:55] <%Mr_Pylon> @mechslayer71 yep, just a few hours ahead of Pat
[3:06:57] <%PadreHail> It's only good for a select few enemies
[3:06:57] <%WhereIsWill> did pat get that extra scene with you know who??
[3:06:58] <%Aracon_> level up barrier as much as possible
[3:07:01] <%CelioHogane> @Solid_Stro Cid doesn't have ATB gauge, he has WBG (Wife Beating Gauge)
[3:07:02] <%Aracon_> manawall is insanely good
[3:07:02] <%luftraumm1> Cloud is growing fast as a character
[3:07:06] <%Dragon_Batman> @CelioHogane True, Red is probably gonna be there by default and Yuffie and Cait will most likey be there, tho who knows.
[3:07:07] <%tusk102> @Solid_Stro his limit break is him cursing at his wife and getting a full atb bar
[3:07:10] <%Aydarkzero> @WhereIsWill that's later
[3:07:13] <%NopeBadguy> could use ward bind
[3:07:14] <%PadreHail> Barrier + Magnify is s e x
[3:07:18] <%Aracon_> ^
[3:07:19] <%mechslayer71> @mr_pylon You okay with minor spoiler?
[3:07:23] <%RAAAAAINMAKER> I'd level revive, full health life is great
[3:07:29] <%NopeBadguy> ward bind helps with sleep, silence, and berserk
[3:07:29] <%WhereIsWill> @aydarkzero ah gotcha
[3:07:32] <%Solid_Stro> All these Cid Wife beating jokes are too strong LUL
[3:07:34] <%Aracon_> once you get manawall and you use that with magnify oh man
[3:07:35] <%Mr_Pylon> @mechslayer71 no thanks, but thanks for asking
[3:07:37] <%spiritofmojave> @luftraumm1 with the open world stuff they'll have to work on, sure mechanically it's gonna get more party management stuff. that'd be ideal
[3:07:37] <%Legato_Ambrose> Levelling revive takes quite a while tho
[3:07:37] <%CelioHogane> @Dragon_Batman Man, Yuffie and Vincent are going to get soooo much new content
[3:07:38] <%myriad_truth> Yeah, level Revive is great
[3:07:40] <%rufus2k2> thoom thoom THOOM
[3:07:45] <%mechslayer71> Okay cool @mr_pylon
[3:07:46] <%Aydarkzero> i prefer cure + all but i'll prob switch for Hard mode
[3:07:51] <%Mr_Pylon> @mechslayer71 so 1 thanks
[3:07:55] <%Aracon_> alright sick then you're good with that
[3:07:56] <%bread_assassin> @PadreHail Is Maginify better paired with barrier than haste or Cure?
[3:07:56] <%Aydarkzero> it's been pretty tough
[3:08:00] <%PocketChange117> Pat, can you dance to this while you're heading through this area
[3:08:04] <%heartlesshealer> Wonder if the ghosts are gonna make sure that Cloud beats the crap out of Aerith at the temple
[3:08:05] <%floralkami> @axellogic like right then, zooming super in on Barrett's back while he was against the wall
[3:08:06] <%tusk102> Cid has a unique summon which is, of course, his wife, who has no attack moves
[3:08:07] <%Sir_stride> so did you guys get the aerith dream sequence?
[3:08:08] <%CelioHogane> I hope they just do the open world like XV, because it was pretty fun there.
[3:08:14] <%Dragon_Batman> @CelioHogane Hell yea, the fact that they will most likely be non optional is gonna be so good
[3:08:14] <%stuntdoublejesus> i feel the overworld will be instanced like 12
[3:08:20] <%myriad_truth> Just die a bunch
[3:08:21] <%zetastriker> Revive doesn't take that long and heals more than a Phoenix Down though
[3:08:22] <%Aydarkzero> @tusk102 she makes the enemy bad tea
[3:08:23] <%realm_forge> I’m loving this cyberpunk reggae
[3:08:26] <%Axellogic> It even fails when the enemy is glued in place
[3:08:26] <%KasiCrafter> Revive taking so long is why it should be sooner, not later, no?
[3:08:26] <%tigerfang86> ITS THE SAME GUY
[3:08:27] <%PadreHail> Cid "Use my monkey wrench on this stupid wench" Highwind
[3:08:27] <%Aracon_> I'm in post game and I still haven't leveled up revive lmao
[3:08:27] <%PocketChange117> THEY'RE BACK LOL

[3:09:07] <%Dragon_Batman> Do Wreck em Pants
[3:09:08] <%luftraumm1> BEck got an E.Skill too
[3:09:16] <%Manjove> i usually give Barret Revive, since he is ranged
[3:09:18] <%InfamousShephard> Grungy Bandits > Turks
[3:09:21] <%JumbleJams> just flailing his arms and walking forward LUL
[3:09:23] <%BeatBo_2> is this just a Yakuza fight?
[3:09:30] <%BeatBo_2> but FF7
[3:09:31] <%NitronStreams> yes
[3:09:32] <%PadreHail> You can telegraph every single one of big dude's attacks
[3:09:34] <%Aracon_> tifa help we need your big punches
[3:09:35] <%myriad_truth> So that guy is 7ft tall
[3:09:35] <%pynkdoe> tifas pants have been wrecked
[3:09:36] <%trustycoyote> That guy was playing Tekken not FF7 LUL

[3:09:41] <%stuntdoublejesus> barret thicc boi
[3:09:44] <%Aydarkzero> never played Yakuza and it looks like one LUL
[3:09:52] <%realm_forge> This music is like an aggressive fashion show
[3:09:53] <%cowardman93> the open world will probably be large fields separated by linear areas
[3:09:54] <%KawaiiJetty> For a second i thought you were fighting The Heavy with rambo hair]
[3:09:56] <%heartlesshealer> Big guy just hates Tifa
[3:10:01] <%spiritofmojave> these bois may as well be from Yakuza/God Hand
[3:10:02] <%cowardman93> you may get the car early to help with it
[3:10:04] <%floralkami> @axellogic it still has to change when switching characters, and the smooth transition doesn't always work as intended. they can only playtest for so long, and that kind of bug is easily fixed most of the time to not be a huge concern
[3:10:06] <%sporeian94> this is one of the most bizarre fucking music tracks in the game.
[3:10:08] <%Aracon_> spinning arms attack!
[3:10:10] <%tusk102> @Dragon_Batman people would riot more if cid didn't hit is wife LUL
[3:10:12] <%Chester_goes_Berserk> The devs sooo played yakuza and took ideas on board
[3:10:16] <%Aydarkzero> he's just waving his arms in a circle and if you walk int it it's your fault!
[3:10:20] <%Dragon_Batman> @tusk102 Hah
[3:10:21] <%WhereIsWill> hope Tifa comes with this song if she get in tekken

[3:13:09] <%unstablebeast19> lifesaver is Barretts best but underrated skill.
[3:13:14] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @stuntdoublejesus Sounds like hot shit. hurr durr
[3:13:16] <%Ultimatefool> This is the BRR BRR BRRRRP song
[3:13:24] <%j0ustar> a banger that's what it is
[3:13:24] <%realm_forge> Chadley’s virgin field repelled most of the rubble
[3:13:25] <%stuntdoublejesus> @pynkdoe spoilers stop
[3:13:25] <%Run44forrest> daphHide
[3:13:26] <%VashyronM> I actually really dislike lifesaver
[3:13:46] <%Solid_Stro> @vashyronm Especially in hard mode
[3:13:47] <%myriad_truth> Lifesaver is alright..kinda
[3:13:47] <%Aydarkzero> she did the hero pose!
[3:13:50] <%unstablebeast19> @vashyronm why do you dislike it?
[3:13:50] <%heartlesshealer> poison is destroying Barret
[3:13:52] <%Aracon_> dude starshower is so ridiculous
[3:13:52] <%spiritofmojave> Funny how this whole little area has the best battle tracks
[3:13:53] <%PadreHail> Spoilers the final boss is just Beck using Sephiroth's sword
[3:13:54] <%Metballs> Lifesaver is great. Just throw that and a regen on and you got your MT
[3:13:55] <%pynkdoe> @stuntdoublejesus for realies i havent played :(
[3:13:56] <%Verd_254> doodThirst_SQ doodLUL
[3:13:56] <%Manjove> Starfall is so fucking cool
[3:13:57] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Will this song become as famous as LA HEE though?
[3:14:02] <%Run44forrest> divekick is so bad
[3:14:04] <%RAAAAAINMAKER> unbind divekick, its garbage
[3:14:11] <%optimasmaximas> yo mods @pynkdoe spoiling
[3:14:14] <%stuntdoublejesus> dont believe u but ok
[3:14:15] <%spiritofmojave> @king_wolf_rigger LA HEE is also timeless
[3:14:18] <%myriad_truth> Divekick is better when enemies are low health
[3:14:22] <%Dragon_Batman> I mean you have to point it at an enemy
[3:14:24] <%Aydarkzero> starshower + into divekick
[3:14:30] <%Keyd00d> It's strong you just have to be near, she doesn't auto run to them
[3:14:32] <%ringabal> Divekick is only good when you combo it after Upercut
[3:14:35] <%VHGS> you skip the first 60% of the animation if you're already in the air, like after an uppercut
[3:14:35] <%Keyd00d> which does suck
[3:14:35] <%cowardman93> I like Divekick personally you just gotta make sure you're in range
[3:14:39] <%myriad_truth> Overpower +divekick is good
[3:14:41] <%VashyronM> @unstablebeast19 Everytime I've had it go off, yeah, it saves Tifa or Cloud, but put's Barret at low life since the heal comes out of his lifepool
[3:14:42] <%Zombrocom> Oh look, the filler arms
[3:14:43] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt starshower or uppercut into divekick
[3:14:46] <%KasiCrafter> Seems like a combo move, I agree.
[3:14:53] <%preppyposs> PTSD FOR TIFA
[3:14:55] <%WhereIsWill> shoryuken into dive kick is super strong
[3:14:58] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @spiritofmojave I bet someone could do a mash up of LA HEE and this BRR BRR BRRRRR
[3:14:58] <%spiritofmojave> Divekick is solid for stagger building tho
[3:15:03] <%mechslayer71> Dive kick is super strong it just has little range @patstaresat really good after an uppercut
[3:15:03] <%PocketChange117> I
[3:15:05] <%Solid_Stro> Remember to wall bounce and wombo combo
[3:15:07] <%Dragon_Batman> That is why I undbind the moves that you need to be near people to hit, you just walk there and bam
[3:15:07] <%shurtal> you can divekick at the end of whirling uppercut
[3:15:08] <%VHGS> it's pretty much just braver if you do it raw
[3:15:08] <%Aracon_> yeah doing like starshower into overpower into uppercut then divekick is the best use I get out of it
[3:15:08] <%floralkami> but divekicks are so cool, tho
[3:15:13] <%Dragon_Batman> Bind*
[3:15:21] <%preppyposs> OOF
[3:15:21] <%spiritofmojave> @king_wolf_rigger I'd pay for that if I had any money LUL
[3:15:27] <%Aydarkzero> those beams are important Kappa
[3:15:30] <%Ultimatefool> How the hell does Barret fit under those boxes?
[3:15:30] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @spiritofmojave lol same
[3:15:31] <%weissguard> Characters having PTSD while this amazing track bonks in the background is kinda giving me tonal dissonance.
[3:15:31] <%heartlesshealer> oh damn
[3:15:33] <%preppyposs> BIG OOFS IN CHAT
[3:15:34] <%ScreamLord> ScreamLord subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! Hey Pat enjoy my first sub that I actually payed for myself. Also It still baffles me why Shinra thought destroying basically 2 small cities to kill 6-7 people was ever worth it.

[3:19:20] <%ringabal> Words are hard for Pat, guys
[3:19:24] <%myriad_truth> Bertha is so good
[3:19:26] <%cutecheeks> Barret is a punch girl
[3:19:34] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> It packs a WOLLOP
[3:19:35] <%myriad_truth> Provoke is great!!
[3:19:39] <%stuntdoublejesus> wha happened to the jams?
[3:19:41] <%heartlesshealer> Uhh... maybe deadly dodge?

[3:20:10] <%Aydarkzero> Kappa
[3:20:10] <%unstablebeast19> binding is actually really good since alot of non robots can be put to sleep
[3:20:11] <%myriad_truth> Provoke is great on Barret!
[3:20:14] <%Guardiansaiyan> @Garthunox lol
[3:20:19] <%SparkAfterDark> Binding seems like it will be extremely clutch in certain situations
[3:20:21] <%Dragon_Batman> I personally find Sleep is super good
[3:20:22] <%ScreamLord> @floralkami LUL
[3:20:33] <%realm_forge> Breach is the polite way to say prariedoggin
[3:20:40] <%Yummy_Nukes> RESISTING INSTANT DEATH IS GONNA BE IMPORTANT
[3:20:42] <%fallen92x> Not gonna upgrade Big Bertha?
[3:20:44] <%Scarnehu> @patstaresat how come you always manage your materia before upgrading your new weapons? if you do it after you only have to do it once
[3:20:46] <%Aracon_> a lot of the status effect materias got really buffed in this game
[3:20:51] <%Dragon_Batman> Even your AI doesn't attack while an enemy is alseep
[3:20:52] <%Aeoneth> Sleep is great in this game, since it's fairly reliable (except bosses) and lets you actually land blizzard/aero attacks
[3:20:55] <%Keyd00d> monkaS

[3:27:03] <%Dragon_Batman> She is lucky
[3:27:03] <%SparkAfterDark> Manhole covers are actually extremely light. Them being heavy in media is just a government coverup designed to stop you from ever going in the sewers because that's where they keep their secret alligator men

[3:28:25] <%CaptainBright> Time to go dig out Jessie's mom for pizza favours
[3:28:26] <%ThriftyShell> You've heard of mind goblins, now get ready for TIME GOBLINS
[3:28:27] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> I wonder what Madame M would have said when they were heading to see marlene
[3:28:27] <%JohnAtDawn> It's because the plate fell apart as it fell
[3:28:29] <%ammobasket> Fancy a slice
[3:28:32] <%Aracon_> @Guardiansaiyan aw fuck you're totally right
[3:28:35] <%cowardman93> I keep looking at it in my game and it's real pit in stomach feel
[3:28:35] <%Alazull> The plate broke up while falling is the best I got
[3:28:36] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Was there anyone on top of the plate?
[3:28:37] <%Keyd00d> Well

[3:28:46] <%reinbachthe3rd> The plate must have broken up as it fell.
[3:28:49] <%Guardiansaiyan> @Alazull yup
[3:28:49] <%Zombrocom> Yeah that is about right
[3:28:50] <%pynkdoe> the "bar"
[3:28:50] <%ConLin_Arts_> BibleThump

[3:28:59] <%CelioHogane> OH NO, THE BAR
[3:28:59] <%VashyronM> @PatStaresAt Probably cause the plate fell in chunks rather than as just a solid mass like in the original?
[3:29:00] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @StaceMcGate OOF

[3:29:02] <%Aracon_> go find your stuff in there
[3:29:03] <%Buzzard42> this shit should all be buried underneat rubble
[3:29:04] <%TheMattman1313> WHAT ABOUT THE FLOWER
[3:29:04] <%gaomachine> I imagine because they blew the plate up as it fell so it was more like a meteor shower than a pancake smush
[3:29:05] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> But there's an underground section, right?
[3:29:07] <%MonsterEnvy> The plate fell all over the place

[4:04:51] <%ape_hawk> barret is so good
[4:04:57] <%Aydarkzero> Feathered Gloves are my favorite weapon for Tifa
[4:05:01] <%VHGS> @myriad_truth the ability is extremely good
[4:05:04] <%Aeoneth> So that's the one thing I haven't liked about the Remake so far... Too many cutscene interruptions when your doing Big Combo

[4:19:01] <%ScottishMadJacko> Oh i got a different sequence
[4:19:02] <%NeonNobleKalzeria> There's 3 different versions....... kinda like the Date Scene in the original
[4:19:02] <%Legato_Ambrose> pick aerith in sewer?
[4:19:02] <%Dragon_Batman> Tifa side quests maybe?
[4:19:02] <%MonsterEnvy> Tifa
[4:19:03] <%myriad_truth> Someone said they had a great shape...
[4:19:03] <%preppyposs> TIFA ROUTE
[4:19:03] <%KawaiiJetty> Wha?

[4:19:04] <%NovaKnightmare> OOOOOO
[4:19:04] <%Pyroclase> This area is so pretty
[4:19:05] <%saynof> Knew it
[4:19:05] <%GohanHitsugaya> Oh...
[4:19:06] <%Alazull> ?
[4:19:06] <%coreyyotto> Like, if you literally just don't do any side quests or something?
[4:19:06] <%JoshyJ> DansGame tifa scene
[4:19:07] <%stuntdoublejesus> u can get aerith
[4:19:07] <%luketrapwalker> This area is pretty.
[4:19:07] <%Kingjhon8> prob side quest based
[4:19:08] <%Axellogic> This is the dataroni equivalent
[4:19:10] <%shurtal> Just like the Dresses, there's three possible outcomes
[4:19:10] <%Sir_stride> @stridentsong sorry. thought people knew
[4:19:11] <%Roundelay11> this is the "romance" scene
[4:19:12] <%StaceMcGate> whoever you were nicest too is who shows up
[4:19:13] <%Yummy_Nukes> doodSweet doodSweet doodSweet doodSweet doodSweet
[4:19:13] <%Aracon_> people out here really prioritizing aerith huh LUL
[4:19:14] <%necrocannibal2> who would ever choose Aerith over Tifa? lol
[4:19:14] <%ConLin_Arts_> ooooh
[4:19:15] <%Aydarkzero> @Dragon_Batman depends on what you pick
[4:19:16] <%SH1NK1R0> Not missable just contextual
[4:19:16] <%DexteraXIII> So there's a Barrett version of this sequence, then?
[4:19:19] <%Run44forrest> no it just changes character
[4:19:20] <%BallerSwagBro9k> YEYEYEYEYEYE
[4:19:20] <%ConLin_Arts_> Whaaaaat
[4:19:23] <%PadreHail> I'm not saying people were talking about spoilers I'm just talking about people blurting out DID ___ HAPPEN YET
[4:19:24] <%ShichiNoBushi> Was it helping Tifa before the boss fight in the sewers?
[4:19:24] <%Aeoneth> So there are 3 different sequences that can play for this part, it's basically like the dating sequence from the OG
[4:19:26] <%ConLin_Arts_> For me Aerith was here
[4:19:27] <%Dragon4234> @PatStaresAt There's three different versions of this scene for your party depending on all your choices
[4:19:28] <%Zombrocom> Baret has the best one
[4:19:28] <%Treuan> Best girl wins then
[4:19:29] <%Kingjhon8> is this when the sex happens?
[4:19:30] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Spoiler Alert it's revealed Tifa actually got implants
[4:19:31] <%myriad_truth> EVERYONE chooses Aerith over Tifa
[4:19:31] <%JoshyJ> S O L D I E R
[4:19:31] <%zanzibar_junker> doodSweet doodSweet doodSweet doodSweet doodSweet
[4:19:32] <%tigerfang86> it depends on affection score I think

[4:19:40] <%Robot_Nixon_> D:

[4:19:41] <%Legato_Ambrose> So there's a sequence where he walks outside and it's just Cid there being emotional?

[4:21:53] <%Axellogic> Tifa Date complete
[4:21:55] <%Aydarkzero> a human being
[4:21:55] <%VashyronM> The scene isn't missable. It can just play out with a different character. Barret, Tifa, or Aerith depending on choices you make @PatStaresAt
[4:21:56] <%UvBenServed> Eww
[4:21:57] <%ratreborn> lol
[4:21:57] <%worldbrand> ??? what's that?
[4:21:58] <%CelioHogane> @StridentSong you could say that he isn't very SOLID about anything

[4:22:09] <%Pyroclase> So Cloud is the anti-Pat
[4:22:11] <%Aeoneth> So Pat not sure if you saw it earlier, but there are 3 variants to that scene, it;s like the dating scene from the OG
[4:22:11] <%NovaKnightmare> holla at ya bois at AVALANCHE
[4:22:11] <%Garthunox> dick me dead and bury me pregnant
[4:22:12] <%Tearonex> holler at ya boy
[4:22:13] <%MakotoPB> Crying is scientifically not a waste of time when used as an emotional release
[4:22:16] <%RAAAAAINMAKER> You can get 3 options for that scene in the Garden
[4:22:17] <%TimetodiveLTX> cloud is mew2king send post

[4:22:49] <%stuntdoublejesus> wait cloud becaome a human in the OG? Im pretty sure he was practically soulless at the end
[4:22:49] <%Zombrocom> To get barret you have to basically do zero side quests
[4:22:50] <%Aracon_> @Solid_Stro ohhhh boy

[4:45:11] <%BubbaRands> WATER SNEK HATE SHOCKT
[4:45:13] <%mechslayer71> Level 30+is recommended @patstaresat
[4:45:13] <%TimetodiveLTX> Llllllightning...
[4:45:18] <%Axellogic> Levi doesnt hate lightning that much
[4:45:19] <%KawaiiJetty> Me too Leviathan
[4:45:21] <%unstablebeast19> pat, have you tried upgrading the buster sword or iron sword recently? i found them better thqn hard edge because theyre more balanced and have more materia slots. also manaward or manawall help alot in this fight
[4:45:24] <%heartlesshealer> Good thing Barret's a tank now
[4:45:28] <%espanishcanamurciana> wipe for the delicious data for Shinra
[4:45:29] <%Robot_Nixon_> I don't like lightning either FeelsBadMan
[4:45:33] <%Meow0369> When has pat ever let being underlevelled and unequipped stop him?
[4:45:33] <%PocketChange117> YEET
[4:45:35] <%Solid_Stro> @floralkami Some never grew up...
[4:45:37] <%ConLin_Arts_> I haven't even tried Leviathan yet, should go back to 7R and clean it up for the Platinum!
[4:45:41] <%Keyd00d> In the end Buster beats out most other swords imo
[4:45:42] <%mechslayer71> @unstablebeast19 But big number tho
[4:45:42] <%Axellogic> Manaward all is the only thing that will keep you alive so make sure you keep it up
[4:45:52] <%chiluzza> i beat her at 30 and i had ti ise all the barruers to survive the ult
[4:45:56] <%myriad_truth> Yeah, Manaward is lifesaving!
[4:45:59] <%Aydarkzero> this fight was nuts
[4:46:08] <%bread_assassin> I keep seeing Manaward as Man award instead of Mana ward
[4:46:11] <%Keyd00d> Yep
[4:46:11] <%chiluzza> and aerith heal bottimg
[4:46:12] <%valriot> It a funny cos she weak to lightning but I'm pretty sure she's also lightning element LUL
[4:46:13] <%prism_zet> very hard
[4:46:18] <%prism_zet> i'd do it after sidequests
[4:46:20] <%Aracon_> this fight is kinda rough
[4:46:22] <%pynkdoe> its not man award >
[4:46:23] <%pynkdoe> ?
[4:46:25] <%baronblank> yea, leviathan is way harder than the first two
[4:46:29] <%Keyd00d> I did this after all the other side quests
[4:46:31] <%baronblank> imo
[4:46:34] <%mechslayer71> @valriot Not in this game. There’s no element on it
[4:46:34] <%espanishcanamurciana> just imagine it's nemesis
[4:46:35] <%Aracon_> tho I think I was a little over leveled during this part of the game
[4:46:40] <%spiritofmojave> yeah and there's the equivalent to a party-wide aoe which just wipes the floor with you
[4:46:51] <%Aydarkzero> Square definitely made up for X5 Leviathan boss fight thats for sure

[4:52:41] <%Wool> Wool subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 14 months! Wanted to share a hustle. Raymond, an AC Villager, is so popular that he's in high demand on eBay. I sold mine for around $45, but a hacker with infinite Raymonds has made over $2,000 off the cat. Here's some trafficking money.
[4:52:42] <%myriad_truth> I personally kept going back to the Buster sword once I got the moves.
[4:52:45] <%pynkdoe> fast travel so late(?) into the game or for the next part?

[4:53:40] <%Aracon_> yeah buster sword is pretty solid all around
[4:53:46] <%Aydarkzero> it's like the Kingdom Key in KH3 :)
[4:53:53] <%Aracon_> cloud just works better as an all rounder I feel
[4:53:57] <%Aydarkzero> ^
[4:53:57] <%mechslayer71> @taliskanju earlier today, he got a package
[4:54:02] <%Solid_Stro> @taliskanju Longer than the pandemic started
[4:54:04] <%emperordread> @TalisKanju There was that one dipshit delivery guy the other week
[4:54:04] <%Zombrocom> @TalisKanju A couple hours ago when the delivery man was here
[4:54:05] <%Mornaka> Hardedge was my favorite
[4:54:10] <%mechslayer71> @aydarkzero GOTCHA
[4:54:12] <%cutecheeks> big yells
[4:54:17] <%RyanTheRecluse> Buster Sword is my all rounder but if something absolutely needs to die the Hardedge comes out.
[4:54:19] <%bread_assassin> What's the tactical difference between the Buster Sword and Iron Blade? They seem like they both fulfill the seem role as all-rounder.
[4:54:27] <%OneGorillionDollars> psaPorgmo psaPorgmo psaPorgmo psaPorgmo
[4:54:34] <%unstablebeast19> buster sword is the most balanced, followed by iron blade but iron blade ends up with more materia slots
[4:54:39] <%Typhaeon> Can't wait to do a crit bullshit nail bat build
[4:54:40] <%myriad_truth> Plus the Buster sword looks great in cutscenes
[4:54:45] <%Solid_Stro> @bread_assassin A couple of unique stuff in each
[4:54:49] <%Aydarkzero> i don't like elemental it's weird
[4:54:53] <%RyanTheRecluse> iron blade has higher magic attack and lower base attack
[4:54:54] <%NeonNobleKalzeria> Buster Sword just always looks great
[4:54:55] <%TalisKanju> @mechslayer71 @Zombrocom He actually saw that person and didn't wait until the person left the house before getting the package?
[4:54:57] <%SH1NK1R0> Buster sword gives more defense and health
[4:55:04] <%Solid_Stro> Whichever one has Bloodsucker is good
[4:55:08] <%optimasmaximas> buster has almost equal magic with iron blade you just gotta upgrade it
[4:55:09] <%amused_platypus> is omnislash in this game
[4:55:09] <%Pyroclase> Cutscene vanity is my favorite vanity. I love seeing my custom character doing cool stuff.
[4:55:10] <%mechslayer71> Yeah, that’s how he made it sound
[4:55:11] <%zetastriker> Buster Sword was my favorite for Cloud too. Hardedge is nice, but Tifa is better as a glass cannon anyway
[4:55:17] <%ValuableCitizen> To a dummy like me that has never played any FF is this worth getting?
[4:55:24] <%GohanHitsugaya> Plus the Buster sword is proper iconic.
[4:55:25] <%Mornaka> yes
[4:55:28] <%Aydarkzero> @ValuableCitizen it's pretty solid
[4:55:33] <%Solid_Stro> Yep
[4:55:33] <%Madbearv> is this KH gameplay
[4:55:38] <%Typhaeon> All FFs are standalone technically, you'll miss a few cues from the original but it's no big deal
[4:55:38] <%mechslayer71> @valuablecitizen Yep, great game on its own, all the FF stories are self contained
[4:55:39] <%luftraumm1> @ValuableCitizen seems pretty great
[4:55:47] <%TenderBabyBacon> How is the New barret arm you bought pat. I honestly don't know
[4:55:47] <%king_wragles> @ValuableCitizen This doesn't compare to other FF games in gameplay. So you'll have to take a guess
[4:55:53] <%myriad_truth> This is SOO worth buying
[4:56:11] <%Solid_Stro> @madbearv Yes but without the hearts, darkness, light, memory, darkness
[4:56:11] <%myriad_truth> I beat it the other day
[4:56:15] <%TimetodiveLTX> just got accepted to grad school get hype
[4:56:17] <%PocketChange117> Ah yes. The math portion of the stream
[4:56:25] <%Typhaeon> I'm going to spend more on the soundtrack than the game when they finally restock it
[4:56:36] <%ValuableCitizen> Thanks!
[4:56:39] <%beepbeepbopbop> Yeah, it sold out fast
[4:56:39] <%myriad_truth> I just listen to Stamp
[4:56:40] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Coliseum Battles?
[4:56:44] <%luftraumm1> i wish it was on streaming services already
[4:56:50] <%mechslayer71> @myriad_truth How did you feel about the ending? I was OKAY with it, as someone who never played the original
[4:56:51] <%Solid_Stro> The official soundtrack releases May 28th
[4:57:00] <%KasiCrafter> Geez, good thing weapon point resets are so dumb cheap.
[4:57:03] <%myriad_truth> I'm not saying NOTHING
[4:57:09] <%Aydarkzero> i was kind of hoping when weapons upgraded they got a visual update as well
[4:57:10] <%reinbachthe3rd> Did Pat beat Leviathan?
[4:57:11] <%unstablebeast19> also i believe theres a new weapon in bith the shop in the sector 5 slums and in the wall market weapon shop
[4:57:17] <%WhereIsWill> as all things should be
[4:57:19] <%Solid_Stro> @reinbachthe3rd Nope
[4:57:23] <%mechslayer71> @myriad_truth But did you like it tho
[4:57:26] <%luftraumm1> gotta use barrets melee
[4:57:31] <%myriad_truth> I loved it!
[4:57:45] <%optimasmaximas> new weapons PogChamp
[4:57:51] <%tusk102> did i miss everything
[4:57:54] <%mechslayer71> @myriad_truth I thought it was fine. It can go interesting places tho
[4:57:56] <%Ultimatefool> Barret's melee is hilarious
[4:58:18] <%tusk102> last i was here he was in the shortcut to sector 7. wheres he at now?
[4:58:19] <%unstablebeast19> i know wall market for sure, not 100% about sector 5 slums
[4:58:20] <%optimasmaximas> barret plays melee? smh
[4:58:21] <%Solid_Stro> “I sell big claw arms, Kupo.”
[4:58:23] <%MonsterEnvy> It's a Melee weapon too
[4:58:30] <%prism_zet> his melee stuff is real strong
[4:58:33] <%mechslayer71> @ultimatefool With the way bosses and encounters are built, it’s a trap. Good luck without range against a few bosses
[4:58:33] <%prism_zet> but it still sucks
[4:58:35] <%heartlesshealer> nice
[4:58:49] <%Run44forrest> this song kinda sounds like my girl wants to party all the time party all the time
[4:58:49] <%heartlesshealer> Looks like you mastered maximum fury
[4:58:53] <%zetastriker> Problem with Barret's melee is he CAN'T hit flyers at all. He doesn't jump like Tifa and Cloud
[4:59:04] <%zetastriker> He runs out of AP then can't do ANYTHING
[4:59:05] <%Aydarkzero> i just realized that one of Aerith's outfits is her Kingdom Hearts Dress
[4:59:05] <%unstablebeast19> get one of the connected and the other becomes an additional
[4:59:18] <%myriad_truth> Wait, there are outfits?
[4:59:27] <%Aydarkzero> the outfits for the Don i mean
[4:59:29] <%mechslayer71> @myriad_truth Dresses for side quests
[4:59:40] <%myriad_truth> Oh
[4:59:45] <%Aydarkzero> i hope they add costumes in the future
[4:59:46] <%Madbearv> Barret is too handsome
[4:59:47] <%CelioHogane> Im really confused to why there isn't costumes in the game, even if as DLC, seems kinda odd.
[4:59:47] <%Solid_Stro> KH1 Cloud DLC when
[4:59:51] <%Madbearv> I can't
[4:59:51] <%Aydarkzero> ^
[4:59:52] <%WhereIsWill> so it's a gimmick weapon??
[5:00:06] <%WhereIsWill> and same @solid_stro
[5:00:12] <%Dragon_Batman> Subjective
[5:00:13] <%prism_zet> interesting build aroudn, but ranged loss sucks
[5:00:13] <%Afterman_> knuck
[5:00:15] <%heartlesshealer> depends
[5:00:15] <%valkuma> feathered
[5:00:15] <%Sir_stride> metal knuckles for attack
[5:00:16] <%amused_platypus> i want to see him uppercut
[5:00:18] <%LaughingCatt> I prefer Feathered
[5:00:18] <%Aydarkzero> Feathered for balanced/Support
[5:00:18] <%JohnAtDawn> MEtal has highest attack
[5:00:19] <%zetastriker> Metal Knuckles
[5:00:22] <%myriad_truth> Tifa gets a better one later
[5:00:23] <%prism_zet> feather gloves for now are fine
[5:00:26] <%heartlesshealer> upgrade the knuckles, then compare
[5:00:27] <%bread_assassin> I think Tifa's six weapon is the best.
[5:00:28] <%Dragon_Batman> Feathered might be best for speed I find
[5:00:28] <%Madbearv> whichever looks cooler pat
[5:00:29] <%RyanTheRecluse> sonic strikers
[5:00:32] <%unstablebeast19> i say feather
[5:00:32] <%Solid_Stro> Metal Knuckles has the highest damage
[5:00:37] <%unstablebeast19> or sonic
[5:00:41] <%Mornaka> Metal knuckles big number, feathers have higher concentration chance i believe
[5:00:44] <%emperordread> This is a very chill stream, but I gotta catch it after a sleep. Have fun Pat and chat
[5:00:45] <%Aydarkzero> side quest time PogChamp
[5:00:45] <@StridentSong> @PatStaresAt Do the Chocobo sidequest first. It makes it much easier to do the rest of the sidequests
[5:00:47] <%Dragon_Batman> I would walk more

[5:02:13] <%ammobasket> time for a locksmith
[5:02:14] <%myriad_truth> I think theres a new weapon for Cloud in Wall Market

[5:05:41] <%Dragon_Batman> I do really like the melee with him LUL
[5:05:44] <%hzealot> i told you not to call me bro @PatStaresAt
[5:05:45] <%amused_platypus> the claw kills all
[5:05:48] <%Solid_Stro> Yuffie is gonna steak everyone’s Meteria in the beginning of the next game. Which is why you start with nothing.
[5:05:49] <%Axellogic> Barret Smash
[5:05:51] <%myriad_truth> I hated that claw weapon
[5:05:51] <%Keyd00d> His melee is soooo slow but it hits like a truck
[5:05:51] <%TimetodiveLTX> in my dreams they make a real character action system with these incredible animations

[5:11:22] <%mechslayer71> Chocobos are just bigger ostriches with cuteness turned up to 5000
[5:11:24] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @PatStaresAt Angriest Pat wouldve beaten FF7 already
[5:11:24] <%Robot_Nixon_> Chocos are feathery kitties :)

[5:22:58] <%Dakuu75> enemy variety seems a smidge small in this game. Although it is jsut the begining of FF7 so, I get it.
[5:23:00] <%UvBenServed> No
[5:23:04] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Never calm down Barrett

[5:23:27] <%Nupinoop296> he only has chill around his daughter it seems
[5:23:27] <%CommanderSqueaks> Barret has anti-chill. He sucks the chill out of the room just by being in it.
[5:23:28] <%Darkfire346> HASTE ON BARRETT
[5:23:34] <%ratreborn> @Dakuu75 literally every enemy from the midgar section is in in someway as ive seen

[5:23:55] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Cloud looks like he's chill but it's actually just intense trauma
[5:23:56] <%unstablebeast19> that charge move works the same with his gun, but charges his shooting triangle ability, so i love using it, knocking enemies up then fireing at them in the air
[5:23:57] <%heartlesshealer> ...
[5:23:59] <%myriad_truth> I didn't know to use Haste in this game
[5:24:02] <%espanishcanamurciana> cool musak
[5:24:03] <%luftraumm1> i like how cloud cuts the boxes, and barret just blows them up
[5:24:05] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @mechslayer71 lol Yeah, the OST is pretty damn top-tier.

[5:26:56] <%RetroCop87> counter
[5:26:56] <%unstablebeast19> nope, just wait
[5:26:57] <%barkon345> @Axellogic he just picked up self destruct
[5:27:03] <%heartlesshealer> its dodge is the attack, of course it's the worst
[5:27:03] <%RyanTheRecluse> should use maximum fury with the melee arm
[5:27:04] <%Darkfire346> never used the Enemy Skill materia in the original game
[5:27:04] <%Axellogic> okay
[5:27:04] <%valkuma> the helicoptor guards are the 2nd worse enemies in the game. you havent seen the 1st worse yet
[5:27:06] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @King_Wolf_Rigger Yeah, I've heard that said before. I can't stand it, but as long as they keep it to themselves, I don't really care

[5:28:02] <+invader_zimerman> invader_zimerman subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[5:28:02] <%Explodincatz> these guys suck
[5:28:05] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @GarbageQueenEllie I mean, to compare pencil on paper to a real human child suffering as nuts to me.
[5:28:09] <%valkuma> here are the 3rd worse enemies in the game

[5:28:18] <%JetpackMcQuack> psaPorgmo WAAARK
[5:28:20] <%chiluzza> that did no damage
[5:28:22] <%CommanderSqueaks> This is some DMC 5 esque beats.
[5:28:22] <%tigerfang86> wait did that just say They "VIOLATE ALL KNOWN MORALS AND PRINCIPALS OF SCIENCE" in the enemy bio
[5:28:25] <%Axellogic> melee barret can stunlock one
[5:28:27] <%tigerfang86> holy SHIT
[5:28:27] <%Roundelay11> these are way worse than terpsicolts
[5:28:28] <%rumtumtugnutz> this song is great
[5:28:28] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @King_Wolf_Rigger Yeah I hear ya, I just think it's hella gross is all
[5:28:36] <%RetroCop87> wait for it...
[5:28:41] <%spiritofmojave> melee barret is stronk PogChamp
[5:28:41] <%Dragon_Batman> The funny part is he still shoots with his no gun arm
[5:28:43] <%Aydarkzero> LUL
[5:28:47] <%Legato_Ambrose> YEAH
[5:28:52] <%valkuma> yeah these enemies ignore all the other mechanics in the game
[5:28:53] <%barkon345> Is barret using Goofy's move set?
[5:28:56] <%Aydarkzero> here comes some fast dd13 Stagger bars!
[5:28:56] <%amused_platypus> he stopped beating one up so he could pray then proceeded to smack them
[5:29:02] <%Aydarkzero> ff*\
[5:29:04] <%suikudo> That combo was lit
[5:29:09] <%flamingmonkies2> yea these guys are a very annoying fight
[5:29:10] <%heartlesshealer> Aeroga happened
[5:29:17] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @GarbageQueenEllie I can agree with you. I don't get it. Need me some MEAT on my ladies lol.
[5:29:19] <%RetroCop87> Focus on one at a time
[5:29:20] <%valkuma> you actually want to hit them in the dance
[5:29:30] <%Darkfire346> stagger locked!
[5:29:36] <%Dragon_Batman> The gimmick to them is tricky
[5:29:37] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @King_Wolf_Rigger Tifa works at Arby's fo sho
[5:29:37] <%Explodincatz> scan data lies
[5:29:42] <%valkuma> the bio on these guys straight up lies to you
[5:29:45] <%rumtumtugnutz> Wait, why is Barrets arrm a weird hook?
[5:29:49] <%Run44forrest> i dont understand what is happening
[5:29:51] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @GarbageQueenEllie Holy shit, that's good.
[5:29:56] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @valkuma Wait whats the gimmick
[5:29:57] <%heartlesshealer> double aeroga
[5:29:58] <%CelioHogane> @rumtumtugnutz for BIG DAMAGE
[5:29:59] <%Roundelay11> you're gonna be here awhile
[5:30:01] <%RyanTheRecluse> Pat read the assess but is blind so he couldn't comprehend it
[5:30:04] <%lord_traxis> He needed scissors. 61!
[5:30:04] <%Dragon_Batman> @rumtumtugnutz He has melee options
[5:30:06] <%valkuma> @XeroSigmaPrime making them split is the only way to damage them effectively
[5:30:12] <%heartlesshealer> Uhh
[5:30:15] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> I do wish Tifa had more definition though, but that's alright.
[5:30:15] <%valkuma> @XeroSigmaPrime damaging the clones breaks their hp
[5:30:33] <%prism_zet> definition?
[5:30:33] <%rumtumtugnutz> But why would you melee Barret?
[5:30:39] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @valkuma FML... I just did it the old fashioned way and slowly wore em down
[5:30:43] <%SilverDevilfish> "These are the most annoying enemies in the game" psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead
[5:30:45] <%rumtumtugnutz> His defining characteristic is gun arm
[5:30:48] <%tigerfang86> Melee Barret is wild
[5:30:51] <%코코꾸라> HOW
[5:30:51] <%prism_zet> @rumtumtugnutz cause he stronk
[5:30:54] <%tigerfang86> ALMOST
[5:30:58] <%VHGS> @코코꾸라 raw talent
[5:30:59] <%luftraumm1> @King_Wolf_Rigger they made her more "demure and feminine" but i wish she was more ripped
[5:31:00] <%Dragon_Batman> Barret Melee is huge damage and super armor
[5:31:01] <%HotBloodedHero> Magic bullets!
[5:31:02] <%Legato_Ambrose> clawgun
[5:31:03] <%zetastriker> Melee Barret can stun lock these guys at least. It just takes FOREVER to kill them
[5:31:09] <%코코꾸라> @VHGS Man, I LOVE it when talent wins
[5:31:19] <%prism_zet> wait for dance then pohnd
[5:31:22] <%Darkfire346> "I'm ending this"
[5:31:22] <%ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt Barret's arm fired condensed Fighting Spirit and rage
[5:31:29] <%unstablebeast19> poison the ones you arent focusing
[5:31:35] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @luftraumm1 I want something to grate my cheese on! How else am I gonna make this quesadilla?
[5:31:43] <%suikudo> that weapon looks like its doing fuck all for damage
[5:31:44] <%heartlesshealer> yeah, double hit!
[5:31:50] <%RyanTheRecluse> I mean they aren't
[5:31:55] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @luftraumm1 I don't know if they did make her more demure. But yeah, some shredded abs would be great.
[5:31:55] <%HotBloodedHero> That charge is so satisfying
[5:32:00] <%heartlesshealer> Barret probably interrupts their casting
[5:32:00] <%CelioHogane> This place is beautifull, btw.
[5:32:01] <%Dragon_Batman> They take a large amount of damage
[5:32:07] <%realm_forge> Could Barrett always do that DBZ shit?
[5:32:18] <%floralkami> @garbagequeenellie use a knife
[5:32:20] <%Keyd00d> chi is really good
[5:32:26] <%CelioHogane> @realm_forge yes, it's his classic limit break
[5:32:27] <%Dragon4234> @PatStaresAt Deadly Dodge with Melee Barret is real shit
[5:32:41] <%Dragon_Batman> Ohh shit I haven't tried that
[5:32:44] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @floralkami Dammit, I let Cloud borrow my last one
[5:32:47] <%luftraumm1> @King_Wolf_Rigger i feel that her shoulders don't look like they belong to a badass ass wooper
[5:32:51] <%prism_zet> there's a trick to em pat
[5:32:58] <%fragdar> anyone knows the name of this song?
[5:32:58] <%ratreborn> oh yeah these guy are annoying as shit
[5:33:00] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @King_Wolf_Rigger As a chick who dieted to get "Shredded abs" for a week, holy shit girls have to destroy their body fat and diet to get em...
[5:33:07] <%luckysteak> can magic work on these guys, or is ineffective melee the only option?
[5:33:08] <%tigerfang86> SPIN KICK ME TIFA
[5:33:11] <%RetroCop87> deadly dodge with Aerith is ATB heaven
[5:33:24] <%Explodincatz> there a way to kill them faster but the scan data lies
[5:33:25] <%BigCoffee> @XeroSigmaPrime How bad was it?
[5:33:26] <%ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt The BIO said they're resistant to Melee. So why not use magic?
[5:33:33] <%baronblank> yea, I never learned whatever the trick to this fight is so it's a pain in the ass
[5:33:34] <%tiaramaki> @fragdar Due Recompense. Has a regular and battle version
[5:33:39] <%ape_hawk> thunderhead got blown
[5:33:40] <%reinbachthe3rd> Cloud just got murked by Aeroga.
[5:33:41] <%Run44forrest> is that an instakill?
[5:33:42] <%Dragon_Batman> The dance then clone thing is the big trick
[5:33:43] <%prism_zet> they have to be interupted doing dance, to make a clone, and then you beat the clone up for real damage
[5:33:47] <%heartlesshealer> Yeah
[5:33:55] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Aliens
[5:33:56] <%fragdar> @tiaramaki thanks bud
[5:33:57] <%StaceMcGate> DAMAGE SPONGES
[5:34:02] <%BigCoffee> >defeat the clone to beat them
[5:34:06] <%StaceMcGate> best to poison them @PatStaresAt
[5:34:08] <%ScreamLord> Oh...that's actually super stupid
[5:34:08] <%Dragon_Batman> Again the dance clone thing
[5:34:11] <%ape_hawk> you could always just your bio on them
[5:34:11] <%furiousfurioso> yea you did misread the bio
[5:34:13] <%RyanTheRecluse> Read the yellow
[5:34:15] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @XeroSigmaPrime Yeah, men have to do the same, even though nobody want to talk about what happens when you hit 1% body fat. But I don't really mean shredded in that context. Have you seen Leigh Holland-Keen? Goddam, I have a crush on her.
[5:34:16] <%floralkami> @king_wolf_rigger @luftraumm1 Tifa should be thicker with muscle, but she still wouldn't be shredded. anatomy doesn't work that way unless the person is flexing constantly and dehydrated (like boxers before a match)
[5:34:20] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @BigCoffee In addition to making them toned, I had to diet on Rice and chicken breast + vitamins for 2 months before my abs looked "shredded"
[5:34:22] <%Keyd00d> Brute force
[5:34:22] <%Aydarkzero> psaBig resistance & fast stagger recovery
[5:34:24] <%CelioHogane> Game: "Defeat the clone" Barret: "WHAT CLONE!?"
[5:34:41] <%baronblank> the bio is not helpful, I had no idea hurting the clone did tons of damage to the original
[5:34:43] <%espanishcanamurciana> mmmm thicc tifa
[5:34:43] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @BigCoffee I quit the diet for a week and the abs were gone...
[5:34:47] <%Like51bears> You want them to spawn the clones Pat as dumb as it is
[5:34:48] <%heartlesshealer> Apoptosis?
[5:34:48] <%Dragon_Batman> Doing it without even knowing
[5:34:54] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @floralkami Yeah, I just mean shredded like more definition and larger.
[5:34:59] <%BigCoffee> @baronblank it literally says attack the clone
[5:35:01] <%Keyd00d> Damn he brute forced that to hell
[5:35:03] <%luckysteak> apoptosis is programmed cell death
[5:35:04] <%ConLin_Arts_> Tifa would probably more look like a thinner weightlifter
[5:35:07] <%luftraumm1> @floralkami yeah i understand she wouldn't be dehydrated, but her muscles should be bulging more
[5:35:08] <%StaceMcGate> BARK
[5:35:08] <%PocketChange117> @XeroSigmaPrime you think you could say that the human body isn't meant to look shredded?
[5:35:13] <%Axellogic> When you kill clones they take buckoos of damage
[5:35:13] <%Nupinoop296> baby!!!
[5:35:15] <%ape_hawk> WARK
[5:35:15] <%SH1NK1R0> I love how everyone's "most annoying enemy " is jus the enemy that is anti button mash
[5:35:15] <%heartlesshealer> I was confused at seeing it as a skill
[5:35:17] <%RyanTheRecluse> @baronblank It says right in the bio that killing the clones damages them
[5:35:20] <%CommanderSqueaks> Oh my god those are the cutest noises!
[5:35:22] <%tigerfang86> YOU..... did it
[5:35:25] <%Aracon_> Woooooo
[5:35:28] <%floralkami> @king_wolf_rigger yeah i hit reply just before your last message
[5:35:30] <%Nordguy> b i l l y
[5:35:30] <%ConLin_Arts_> Her arms should at least be a bit bigger
[5:35:32] <%Firgof> ~never-give-up~ [SAX]
[5:35:32] <%prism_zet> now talk to sam
[5:35:34] <%Ancopro> he got sunglasses hes okay
[5:35:36] <%baronblank> no, it just says they spawn clones when you interrupt their dance, which just seemed like a downside to me
[5:35:39] <%GarbageQueenEllie> The amount of difficulty in getting a toned figure adds to the value placed in it. I couldn't do that shit!
[5:35:51] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @floralkami lol yeah, timing.
[5:35:51] <%Darkfire346> if only elmo could make Kweh sounds
[5:35:58] <%Explodincatz> @SH1NK1R0 the scan data is unclear on how to kill them
[5:36:01] <%Robot_Nixon_> SourPls
[5:36:02] <%Firgof> This soundtrack alternates between Maximum Funk and Maximum Jazz at times
[5:36:02] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @King_Wolf_Rigger I mean dudes do have alot easier to look ripped since they have a literal steroid for a male hormone... but I get you, its hard no matter what gender
[5:36:02] <%furiousfurioso> @baronblank the line after that says killing the clone damages the real one
[5:36:04] <%Run44forrest> ARTHUR?
[5:36:07] <%heartlesshealer> Daytime Wall Market?
[5:36:16] <%RyanTheRecluse> and the last line is killing the clone damages the original
[5:36:17] <%unstablebeast19> hello sam Elliot
[5:36:18] <%ScreamLord> That beard is magnificent
[5:36:19] <%코코꾸라> SourPls
[5:36:20] <%floralkami> Tifa's whole body should be bigger, but Japan doesn't know how to handle thick chicks
[5:36:21] <%Dakuu75> fast travel unlocked?
[5:36:22] <%Axellogic> LITERALLY 0 NOW
[5:36:23] <%tigerfang86> Die I guess

[5:36:29] <%zk_nails> eat em
[5:36:29] <%Dragon_Batman> Ooh did some people not scroll the enemy scan?
[5:36:30] <@SoFarFetched> Thanks Plague for the Chocobos.
[5:36:31] <%Aracon_> love chocobos
[5:36:31] <%arancet> fuck ;em
[5:36:32] <%tiaramaki> Is it just me, or is Sam's beard like... looking like it's just glued on?
[5:36:32] <%hzealot> it gets lonely in sector 6
[5:36:33] <%rumtumtugnutz> I just realized whever is playing Chocobo Sam is imitating Sam Elliott.
[5:36:35] <%baronblank> I must have either missed that or didn't realize it meant it would hurt them way more than usual then, my bad I guess
[5:36:40] <%ShichiNoBushi> Race 'em, breed 'em,...
[5:36:41] <%reinbachthe3rd> CHAD
[5:36:41] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @floralkami The bishi bois cannot withstand the power of the THICC
[5:36:43] <%Aracon_> GO DO PULL UPS
[5:36:44] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @floralkami But you should look up Leigh Holland-Keen deadlift the Scottish stones.
[5:36:46] <%ConLin_Arts_> kinda weird how you can make it free just as soon as you actually unlock it
[5:36:46] <%ammobasket> but steps tho
[5:36:49] <%CommanderSqueaks> @sofarfetched If that was Plague he'd be showing you his anthro-chocobo OC.
[5:36:51] <%ape_hawk> yeah, its so different
[5:36:51] <%Darkfire346> since when does wallmarket have a daytime?
[5:36:52] <%Firgof> Day Market is so blah lol
[5:36:52] <%lord_traxis> So, is Chocobo Sam cool or a dirtbag? He seems alright, but there's the human trafficking angle that makes me go "ehhh"
[5:36:53] <%ShichiNoBushi> Check the alleys.
[5:37:00] <%Robot_Nixon_> its all dirty DansGame
[5:37:03] <%Aydarkzero> Nothing HAPPENED
[5:37:04] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @PocketChange117 Yup its fucking ridiculously hard. That being said, over hydrating for 2 weeks then dehydrating for a day wroks wonders to make you look shredded for an hour... till you nearly pass out
[5:37:05] <%Aracon_> LUL
[5:37:05] <%코코꾸라> Don't know her
[5:37:06] <%StaceMcGate> My sweet Chad
[5:37:06] <%spiritofmojave> Strolling to see my Chadley
[5:37:07] <@SSaryn> Day time wall market is fucking weird and grimy as fuck
[5:37:08] <%MonsterEnvy> Find Madam M
[5:37:09] <%WhereIsWill> LUL
[5:37:10] <%Yummy_Nukes> reminds me of las vegas in the day time
[5:37:12] <%floralkami> @tiaramaki they spent all the money on Cloud's spikes
[5:37:12] <%ape_hawk> Nailed it. I know. Thank you, moving on.
[5:37:13] <%Legato_Ambrose> I definitely didn't give this kid his first boner, Barret
[5:37:14] <%luftraumm1> s'all a blur
[5:37:15] <%Aracon_> day time walmart is so gross
[5:37:16] <%TimetodiveLTX> we stop telling the story after the mason jar full of spiders breaks
[5:37:16] <%Guardiansaiyan> @SSaryn like Vegas
[5:37:16] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Nothing happened.
[5:37:16] <%ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt I never knew what a Virgin Chad looked like until Chadlow
[5:37:17] <%GohanHitsugaya> For no particular reason at all...
[5:37:17] <%BubbaRands> WHAT NEVER BEEN TO WALL MARKET IN MY LIFE
[5:37:20] <%suikudo> Daytime wallmarket is just another slum
[5:37:20] <%baronblank> well I already beat them on hard mode so I'll never be dealing with them again anyway I guess lol
[5:37:25] <%heartlesshealer> skill master
[5:37:25] <%MonsterEnvy> Super recomend finding Madam M
[5:37:25] <%LouieRouie> Wasn't me
[5:37:25] <@SoFarFetched> @CommanderSqueaks That's when you put in the secret code or data mine to get Plagues art.
[5:37:25] <%Nupinoop296> well SOMETHING happened but it just managed to not be as bad as it could have been
[5:37:29] <%ammobasket> WALMART? WHAT
[5:37:32] <%Guardiansaiyan> Wall Market DAY = Las Vegas DAY
[5:37:34] <%zestyArsenic> use 3 different skills, gain ATB boost
[5:37:36] <%StaceMcGate> @PatStaresAt issue 3 commands at once to activiate it
[5:37:48] <%SH1NK1R0> Scan data is definitely too vague at times but that doesnt make the enemy itself bad.
[5:37:52] <%unstablebeast19> go to the wall market weapon vendor fi4st
[5:37:56] <%ape_hawk> hey those officers
[5:38:01] <%Firgof> where'd they go

[5:38:36] <%heartlesshealer> pops in with four
[5:38:37] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @XeroSigmaPrime Yeah, on the flip side, the estrogen does help maintain muscle health better so women who do strength training tend to be able to hold it a bit better. Seriously, Leigh Holland-Keen. Scottish stone lift. Youtube. She's awsome.
[5:38:41] <%gaomachine> Blade burst is good though
[5:38:42] <%PanicSwytch> Check the alleys. Chests might be available
[5:38:45] <%Solid_Stro> o__o
[5:38:46] <%Alopekis> Hey, those officers._. Where'd they go?
[5:38:46] <%Maids4lyfe> blade beam!!!

[5:38:55] <%GohanHitsugaya> And blade beams are awesome!
[5:38:56] <%ConLin_Arts_> It worked well when you make it elemental
[5:38:56] <%startstoprepeat> mythril saber's a cool shape but the colours make it look like a toy
[5:38:56] <%Yummy_Nukes> psaBig MAGIC ATTACK
[5:38:59] <%unstablebeast19> clod now has a magic based ability
[5:39:00] <%KasiCrafter> Oops, collisium right next to the store oopsies

[5:39:14] <%cowardman93> he does that variant of the move in Advent children against Sephiroth
[5:39:14] <%Guardiansaiyan> @CommanderSqueaks a team versus B team...or Mina Characters versus NPC
[5:39:15] <%lord_traxis> Yup. It plus first strike is a great opener
[5:39:16] <%Dragon_Batman> Niiiec
[5:39:20] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @KasiCrafter I wonder why that is? lol
[5:39:20] <%luftraumm1> RED mage
[5:39:21] <%Solid_Stro> Coliseum is the best place to grind
[5:39:23] <%rumtumtugnutz> @aslfrasle No, it's the Mithril Saber.
[5:39:24] <%NitronStreams> My sword is a wand
[5:39:24] <%ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt The most realistic looking Sword Cloud has ever owned
[5:39:24] <%Aracon_> yeah big magic weapon

[5:39:33] <%myriad_truth> Its a really good skill
[5:39:33] <%unstablebeast19> thos is clouds mage weapon
[5:39:33] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @King_Wolf_Rigger Oh my god, as a small toned girl, I have a huge thing for ladies built like her <3 Ty for giving me something to "do" tonight
[5:39:35] <%CelioHogane> @cowardman93 on this weapon?
[5:39:37] <%MonsterEnvy> Heavily recommend finding Madam M at her shop.
[5:39:42] <%Aydarkzero> Mythril Saber is nice
[5:39:47] <%myriad_truth> Oh yeah, that thing!
[5:39:50] <@SSaryn> Haven't done math on Trade Off yet but yeah it's pretty good.
[5:39:54] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @XeroSigmaPrime lol My life goal is complete.
[5:40:05] <%Guardiansaiyan> @CommanderSqueaks lots of people see it by the design aspects of NPC's to the outfits of non important characters
[5:40:05] <%aeonicvector> Has Pat reached the Sans Deltarune fight yet?
[5:40:08] <%heartlesshealer> The sword sceptre

[5:40:21] <%Dragon_Batman> Battle mage ahoy
[5:40:25] <%Guardiansaiyan> @aeonicvector Nope! He has to fight Xenehort first!
[5:40:25] <%cowardman93> @CelioHogane yup, as soon as I saw it myself earlier I recognised it from the fight
[5:40:37] <%aeonicvector> @Guardiansaiyan damn, got here too early
[5:40:43] <%Aracon_> not bad at all
[5:40:44] <%SH1NK1R0> Fyi the damage dealt by elemental materia is based on mag stat. Thats why it lists a percentage bonus in the description

[5:43:13] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> lol
[5:43:22] <%VashyronM> My prediction is that Virgil, Nero, and Dante come out of the metaverse and you have to fight them.
[5:43:22] <%floralkami> @xerosigmaprime *shrug* more carbs and higher fat in your protein intake with less cardio?
[5:43:25] <%ape_hawk> @PatStaresAt hey, the VOD might be fucked, btw

[5:43:49] <%DougintheTrench> Stream over now time for Vod's!
[5:43:54] <%Meow0369> When I watched it the plate fall part was skipping
[5:43:56] <%Dakuu75> italians love Pat because Pat is Pasta-pizza aproved <3
[5:43:57] <%ape_hawk> it cuts an hour
[5:44:03] <%Meow0369> it was skipping through and cutting a BUNCH out
[5:44:03] <%heartlesshealer> Twitch pauses and skips on the vods sometimes
[5:44:07] <%aslfrasle> Constantly cuts or skips.
[5:44:07] <%CelioHogane> VODs ruin, reset the run
[5:44:07] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @floralkami Leigh does have the advantage of being like 6' tall. Big skeleton means easier mass gains.
[5:44:11] <%ape_hawk> right when tifa joins cloud on the tower
[5:44:13] <@SSaryn> Huh. Interesting.
[5:44:13] <%floralkami> it skips at important parts too

[5:44:29] <%Meow0369> Yeah it skips all the good shit and keeps the boring no battle parts it's like it knows
[5:44:30] <%TimetodiveLTX> is there a local recording backup?
[5:44:31] <%DougintheTrench> Glad I caught live for once.
