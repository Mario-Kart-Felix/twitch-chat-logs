[0:29:27] <ukokira> Symbiote suit is saved for either dlc or a sequel
[0:29:27] <Coystick> MAKES ME FEEL LIKE SPIDER-MAN
[0:29:29] <HoIlywood_SN> @AngriestPat funfact: Yuri apparently did multiple takes for a shitload of voice lines depending on whether you're just walking around, fighting, or swinging, so if you pay attention he'll sometimes sound strained when talking while swinging or out of breath while in combat when talking on the phone to Yuri or MJ
[0:29:31] <%waddledoops> thats such a nice touch
[0:29:37] <ukokira> Very very very likely saved for a sequel

[0:32:00] <Bobbledygook> spiderman continues to murder people by shooting his goo
[0:32:03] <HoIlywood_SN> @pokechuno it is
[0:32:04] <Fruitywhompus> the docks gotta get to the docks

[0:33:42] <ItsJustShawn> now you have these guns to kill people better
[0:33:42] <ukokira> I can't believe that I did like 80 percent of the game before realizing the triangle stealth takedown was actually super silent and sneaky

[0:34:42] <frydaynitefight> im a big fan of spider punks power but web blossom seems op
[0:34:43] <CorruptDropbear> Web blossom is the best AoE spell
[0:34:43] <%badchoice5> 8 years of watching this exact strategy fail to defeat Spiderman, and they keep trying it
[0:34:43] <Tufty1989> Damn, this game looks dope
[0:34:44] <Noelle808> Some of these are big murders
[0:34:47] <PhearoGuille> @AngriestPat I have a question, does webbing them up while they're knocked down keep them stuck and out of the fight?
[0:34:48] <Endocrom> Wait, weren't THEY the cops?
[0:34:49] <pokechuno> Punches pulled = infinity
[0:34:50] <%AllYouCanYeet> I feel fucking stupid for never using web blossom on my playthough
[0:34:52] <+Demirose41> DID U GET ALL THE BACKPACKS ALREADY
[0:34:56] <+Pat_Squared> I liked the electric fists myself
[0:34:57] <frydaynitefight> i really like battle focus too for the wave battles

[0:35:25] <mayorrev> look at those nerd goggles
[0:35:30] <Austin0097> @PhearoGuille If you web them while they are on the ground or near a wall to the point where they stick to it then they are out of the fight forever.
[0:35:30] <+rogoho> Stroke
[0:35:31] <Coystick> GOD THESE METAL GEAR JANE segments are POISON
[0:35:36] <+xxviios> Still hasnt done the mask lol
[0:35:38] <KiraKamixephos> Yea I never felt it
[0:35:44] <DXLelouch24> PAT 5 levels till WITCHTIME
[0:35:46] <Niney_Who> Yes
[0:35:47] <DXLelouch24> suit mod
[0:35:48] <Tisaric> Web Blossom is the most broken
[0:35:48] <ukokira> Fully leveled swing speed's ridiculous compared to the start tbh
[0:35:51] <+jayfigga> Slow motion mod is OP
[0:35:53] <Niney_Who> But Blossom is fun
[0:35:53] <%craig_t> more like
[0:35:55] <%SuperCasualBoom> Drank 100% RedBull can only feel 2% of it
[0:36:00] <ukokira> Spider Bro absolute murders
[0:36:00] <$Totally_not_toby> look at that toy
[0:36:02] <CorruptDropbear> Spider Bro and Web Blossom because you NEED AoE in this game so hard
[0:36:03] <%shen4u> Yeah spider bro took down that fight in 2 seconds for me
[0:36:06] <$MightyMaxT> @DedlokPM Nah, I meant did he get a new suit for the level up. But I think the next one is at 19. Thanks though
[0:36:08] <ape_hawk> web blossom is basically a pbaoe stun
[0:36:11] <grayjammer> Tokin' IS a crime
[0:36:14] <Niney_Who> Throw is OP
[0:36:15] <Austin0097> @Coystick I may be trash, but I thought they were fun enough.
[0:36:19] <officerjeffersondavis> I wish i got tokens for punching people
[0:36:21] <SamMaZensky> Remember when Peter "Palmer" made his costume out of a leotard he stole from his high school?
[0:36:23] <Demon_chann> @AngriestPat Hey pat did you read about the guy who made a article about him being mad that you help the cops?
[0:36:24] <HoIlywood_SN> funfact, Spider-Mans webs dissolve after an hour, so even if those guys are webbed to the side of the building the webbing will dissolve and they'll fall to their deaths anyway
[0:36:26] <%waddledoops> so does spiderman just inset the crime tokens into the gadget to improve it or like glue them to it
[0:36:32] <+DFDEDSDCD> I never liked Ben Rielly's suit design personally.
[0:36:34] <ukokira> Although web bomb plus concussion grenade combo is like a reusable web blossom
[0:36:34] <Niney_Who> Not Web Throw, Just Throw
[0:36:40] <%craig_t> BORN TO SUFFER SHOCKER IS A FUCK / Web Em All 1962/ I am trash hero/ 410,757,864,530 HOSPITALIZED FISK THUGS
[0:36:43] <Niney_Who> fuck
[0:36:46] <Bobbledygook> @Demon_chann oh my god that shit
[0:36:47] <CorruptDropbear> DAMN
[0:37:00] <+Demirose41> SICK TECH FOR ANYONE WHO CARES. Easy aoe if u ground pound onto enemies while throwing a few web grenades before hand. u web'm and smash them against the nearest wall
[0:37:01] <DashXero> Super kind.
[0:37:04] <HoIlywood_SN> so spider-man is killing a fucking shitload of people in this absolutely
[0:37:05] <LtThunderbolt> web blossom
[0:37:05] <Niney_Who> Honestly that's a good idea Pat
[0:37:07] <PhearoGuille> homecoming's version is definitely better than og scarlet spider imo
[0:37:10] <zal_silverfang> WHERE ELMO
[0:37:10] <%Remery_> The kind Redbull Snorter
[0:37:10] <%pennykettle_> It was very kind of you to let us skip the parts

[0:37:13] <ukokira> Oh god
[0:37:14] <isntit> @waddledoops he pays himself in tokens: it's a self sustaining economy
[0:37:14] <DXLelouch24> know what would be better, not worrying your fans again
[0:37:14] <Niney_Who> Then you're all tough and it streamlines the game
[0:37:15] <+srkAres> your angry neighbourhood pat
[0:37:18] <LtThunderbolt> i think ima N U T
[0:37:20] <dakuman13> it's like you're some kind of best friend or something

[0:37:39] <IntrepidEye> The scenes of him chilling on the subway are great
[0:37:40] <$Mornaka> @AngriestPat the trophy

[0:37:41] <+99STROWNS77> Also there's a trophy
[0:37:42] <+rogoho> Goofy cutscenes
[0:37:42] <logandh3> Maybe do side/story/side/story? Not a bunch of either at once?
[0:37:43] <b1gboss007> To ge the platinum
[0:37:45] <officerjeffersondavis> Wait, theres fast travel in this game?
[0:37:47] <Bobbledygook> @AngriestPat did you go to Doctor Strange's house?
[0:37:48] <Chainshada> Use Fast Travel 5x was the last trophy I got before the Platinum
[0:37:48] <ukokira> Fast travel screens
[0:37:49] <DXLelouch24> yep
[0:37:49] <dakuman13> yeah take the subway
[0:37:52] <Tisaric> I literally only used it for the trophy

[0:38:58] <+Garrosh_Heckscream> Is Spider-Cop coming out of retirement
[0:38:59] <%SuperCasualBoom> If Spider-Man was in Kansas he wouldn’t have tall buildings to swing.
[0:39:00] <+doc_ock_rokc> Spidercop Returns
[0:39:00] <%Deadryot> alex jones?
[0:39:00] <HoIlywood_SN> WELL, HE'S NOT WRONG
[0:39:02] <%badchoice5> THE SPIDERMAN HAS HACKED INTO THE WEB!!!
[0:39:03] <Ran196> was JJ fired from the newspaper?
[0:39:04] <+DFDEDSDCD> "GIVE ME AD REVENUE" - J. Jonah Jameson
[0:39:07] <Bobbledygook> What shall I do Lord?
[0:39:08] <Kaitepaints> Is that j.k. Simmons? Love that guy
[0:39:11] <Prevot> I want JJJ to do a Casper ad
[0:39:12] <Austin0097> Real talk, I think there were some times when JJ was totally right in this game.
[0:39:13] <DXLelouch24> Spideys using your wifi to store his porn of MJ
[0:39:15] <Naho_Saenoki> @Ran196 He retired.
[0:39:16] <dakuman13> did he just raise his hands
[0:39:16] <puppydogcity> guooooooohhh
[0:39:17] <JDebss> Black cat?
[0:39:17] <%Kirijuo> I really hope JJ finds out Peter is Spiderman in later games
[0:39:18] <%SaltyDongs> Oh because he retired Spider-cop
[0:39:22] <SilverInferno3> Lady, you go call Jessica Jones
[0:39:24] <Demon_chann> WHY IS SPIDERMAN STANDING LIKE THAT
[0:39:28] <alexandrecau> look at that yakuzi scenatrio
[0:39:29] <theshockvox> it's not JK but hes still damn good
[0:39:29] <+xxviios> Pete is hacking in and spying on people though
[0:39:30] <puppydogcity> ohhh yes youre wearing the scarlet spider outfit
[0:39:34] <Niney_Who> Time for an Assassin's Creed mission
[0:39:35] <puppydogcity> its sooooo sexy
[0:39:35] <%Trekalone> JJ being an Alex Jones parody is great, but I wish they went all the way and had him advertising herbal supplements and shit
[0:39:36] <eggs_in_bed> it's really good
[0:39:37] <Niney_Who> And not in a good way
[0:39:37] <CatmanIX> ...sure he's not just in rehab?
[0:39:41] <%pennykettle_> I dont like Yuri for Spiderman FeelsBadMan
[0:39:42] <@SSaryn> I sure do love Yoskue as Spider-Man.
[0:39:43] <PhearoGuille> now that's just unfair, Spider-Cop can't ever say know to a pretty face
[0:39:44] <%SuperCasualBoom> Damn you Radrigo
[0:39:44] <%korth367> does he scream out persona at any point
[0:39:44] <Endocrom> Spoiler: he's just cheating on her
[0:39:44] <SailingSaturn> @Kaitepaints Daren De Paul but his voice nails the beats really well
[0:39:44] <Tisaric> this is the best spiderman imo
[0:39:46] <alexandrecau> the woman is gonna be h i s mom
[0:39:47] <Fujiwara_92> YEAH YURI AS SPIDEY IS AMAZING

[0:39:48] <PhearoGuille> *say no
[0:39:49] <ALLHAILTHEBENNY> OH RODRIGO POR QUE!?
[0:39:52] <TranquilTurnip> Sasuke Spiderman
[0:39:53] <potaytoh> This is probably my favourite spider-man that I've seen. In games, at least.
[0:39:55] <officerjeffersondavis> yep
[0:39:55] <+Garrosh_Heckscream> "I hate Spider-Man from the comfort of my bed with my PREDATOR HELIOS 300 laptop!"
[0:39:56] <%korth367> JUST LIKE YOSUKE
[0:39:59] <$Mornaka> he looks like a man
[0:39:59] <%korth367> I SWEAR
[0:39:59] <ape_hawk> IMAGINE TROY BAKES AS SPIDEY
[0:40:00] <HoIlywood_SN> he looks like just a guy
[0:40:00] <HoldBtoRun> he's hot
[0:40:00] <cherubsanonymous> He looks like --- a boy
[0:40:00] <zal_silverfang> sent him the picture? spider man has a PHONE and gave out the number???
[0:40:00] <%craig_t> Not gonna lie, JJ is radical, but he feels like the type who would get fired for saying some "problematic" things about women, minorities, lgbtq folks, etc
[0:40:01] <SilverInferno3> He looks the way he did in the Death Stranding trailer
[0:40:02] <DashXero> He was the black ranger after Zack left.
[0:40:02] <Demon_chann> How old is yuri anyway?
[0:40:03] <%WorthlessSamurai> Yosuke yeah
[0:40:04] <@SSaryn> Looks bizarrely like Yosuke but more handsome.
[0:40:05] <HoIlywood_SN> @AngriestPat he just looks like a guy
[0:40:05] <+fFailureatlife> hes old now
[0:40:05] <ukokira> Yuri honestly has The Spiderman voice
[0:40:08] <CorruptDropbear> WHATEVER YOU SAY PARTNER
[0:40:08] <+WhyIDie> he looks like a floating voice that steals paychecks from other voice actors
[0:40:08] <Niney_Who> I love Yuri Lowenthal I just hate when he's an unexpected additional voices
[0:40:08] <+fFailureatlife> hes 47
[0:40:09] <%Straylightgg> in my head Yuri Lowenthal looks like Yosuke
[0:40:09] <+MechaBaphomet> Looks like yosuke

[0:40:11] <%spacekataz18> She got blue hair
[0:40:11] <Kaitepaints> J.k Simmons in Spider-Man 3 is amazing. I just rewatched it the other day
[0:40:11] <Prevot> BIG CHEATING
[0:40:13] <Clinnamon> Yuri kinda looks like the guy that plays Penguin in Gotham
[0:40:14] <Demon_chann> 47!!
[0:40:14] <%spacekataz18> Thas bad biznis
[0:40:15] <Finchit> yuri is a terrible voice actor
[0:40:16] <Sochin_Iitsu> No he's a handsome man who always wears suits
[0:40:16] <PhearoGuille> yosuke hanamura as spoderman
[0:40:17] <Bobbledygook> he looks like your uncle
[0:40:19] <ravencloak13> @theshockvox Not actually all that different from people listening to police radio broadcast so no, it’s not spying.
[0:40:20] <Demon_chann> he sounds 12

[1:00:48] <CrystalDiglett> @AngriestPat can we switch to the punks pider suit
[1:00:48] <potaytoh> @ukokira Because he's meant to be so rich and influential that he pays everybody off and there is so much corruption

[1:00:54] <Daxalog> Throw someone into a pit
[1:00:56] <+Extrallent> nooo

[1:01:25] <Niney_Who> @Coystick No spoilers cryGrump
[1:01:27] <Fujiwara_92> CANON SUIT FOR CANON MISSIONS
[1:01:27] <buffmurffy> why not the classsic?
[1:01:29] <potaytoh> @SilverInferno3 LUL secret racist spider-man
[1:01:29] <%badchoice5> Does the Spider drone create collateral damage, like beating up random civs by mistake or something?
[1:01:34] <+Tylermcd93> I kinda wish the day/night cycle was dynamic and not tied to the story missions
[1:01:38] <thelonechris> Put on the punk suit Kappa
[1:01:41] <+fFailureatlife> i like the white spider
[1:01:46] <Luesagna00> @angriestpat hate default suit, the white patterns doesnt go well with rest of suit
[1:01:48] <%rdark_ksu> Hi Mr LI its 130 am but look at this mask
[1:01:57] <%pennykettle_> @Tylermcd93 you get to change it whenever you want when you finish the game but yea it really blows
[1:01:57] <+fFailureatlife> its MURICA
[1:02:00] <JDebss> Put on the Spider Ham suit
[1:02:01] <+TheBigO75> the white looks fine
[1:02:04] <+fFailureatlife> RED WHITE AND BLUE BABY
[1:02:05] <Coystick> Aunt May is Spider-Woman
[1:02:06] <%SuperCasualBoom> Spider-Man hype go up, SNK Heroines go down.
[1:02:09] <Niney_Who> @Luesagna00 Ah yes Red white and blu never looked good together. Explain FRANCE
[1:02:15] <SailingSaturn> I'm stil surprised at how much I enjoyed it compared to the stuff I saw about it before
[1:02:19] <$MightyMaxT> Put on the Spider-Punisher suit Kappa
[1:02:20] <%lulzysavant> Japanese Spiderman?
[1:02:22] <%D_day> @luesagna00 That's just your opinion man aleksTeatime
[1:02:22] <+rooked4> I still think the design of the white spider looks awful, but it looks great in motion.
[1:02:23] <321Continue> Oh no, im late for Dr. Connors class
[1:02:24] <%DrFacilier> @badchoice5 No, it has Frank Castle sense. it knows whose a wise guy and who isnt
[1:02:27] <PhearoGuille> @Tylermcd93 I think I can get behind it a bit since alot of the story actually accounts for the passage of time
[1:02:31] <%pennykettle_> This is inferior to Italian Spiderman
[1:02:33] <%badchoice5> Put on the symbiote suit
[1:02:33] <Austin0097> @fFailureatlife I didn't like it at first, but after playing through the game it really grew on me a lot.
[1:02:35] <Demon_chann> What up with the sound? is kinda dying or is it only me?
[1:02:37] <mayorrev> yoooo
[1:02:37] <Belutima> @SuperCasualBoom that could become supre sexuel super fast LUL
[1:02:37] <+jayfigga> The white suit eventually grew on me
[1:02:37] <potaytoh> I like how Deathstroke is from New Zealand. I always knew they were evil.
[1:02:39] <mayorrev> that was cool
[1:02:42] <ukokira> I actually really like the white spider
[1:02:43] <HoIlywood_SN> unpopular opinion: i think that the advanced suit in this game looks better than the version of the classic suit they have in this game (not the classic design itself, just the version that was modeled for this)
[1:02:44] <%pennykettle_> @Demon_chann refresh
[1:02:47] <ukokira> But this game has like
[1:02:48] <+Extrallent> put the homemade suit back on
[1:02:53] <ukokira> 20 better suits
[1:02:55] <zal_silverfang> wow peter. eating the homeless food??
[1:02:56] <+Thorn14> Bagel!
[1:02:57] <bear_breaker20> 99% nailed it
[1:02:57] <+fFailureatlife> bagel
[1:02:58] <mayorrev> DONUT
[1:02:58] <SilverInferno3> Spiderman took notes from the Punisher and got a big white logo, you all should love it
[1:02:59] <%SuperCasualBoom> Japanese Spider-Man has a Megalord thi
[1:03:00] <EMP_Ike_Turner> wens daredevil
[1:03:01] <+fFailureatlife> delicious
[1:03:01] <%mister___doctor> Hey Pat have you ever streamed a Nintendo Direct
[1:03:04] <CrystalDiglett> A BAGEL AND SOME TWITTER
[1:03:05] <%Remery_> Jelly filled?
[1:03:05] <JDebss> I hate all the white on that suit
[1:03:06] <Coystick> Just mash the bagel into your MASK you PIG
[1:03:07] <cerberuscarmine> tasty
[1:03:07] <thelonechris> He's got a New York bagel
[1:03:08] <+WolfmanAl> Spider Bagel
[1:03:08] <Niney_Who> How is he eating that
[1:03:11] <%ArcanumMBD> @tylermcd93 there's actually only 3 times if day which less them bake the lighting for all the static objects which makes the shadows much nicer than dynamic shadows
[1:03:14] <%Rostichenburg> Yeah they made the classic suit look bad so they could make their own design look better
[1:03:14] <%ginger__gaming__> bagel with cream cheese
[1:03:15] <+SparkAfterDark> spiderman is just as poor if not poorer than most of these people anyways
[1:03:18] <mayorrev> dont heel turn on us Li BibleThump
[1:03:19] <$Mornaka> ive had the default suit on for a total of about half a second in my playthrough
[1:03:21] <%mister___doctor> Oh God hes hideous
[1:03:22] <PhearoGuille> like there was this part where spiderman admitted that he hadn't slept for a couple of days straight lol
[1:03:23] <Fruitywhompus> job through the homeless shelter asshole
[1:03:24] <$ImasukyLomae> what they's xrazy
[1:03:24] <nzrai> he's too positive for that
[1:03:25] <%pennykettle_> Hmmm
[1:03:29] <+WolfmanAl> What makes you think that? wolfma103
[1:03:29] <Coystick> **SWEATS IN NEGATIVE**
[1:03:30] <%SuperCasualBoom> Bagels with veggie cream cheese the best
[1:03:31] <%Rostichenburg> There's a way better suit later that looks great in game
[1:03:32] <ShamanKing0811> Nah
[1:03:33] <SailingSaturn> @HoIlywood_SN the white really looks good in the various lightings
[1:03:34] <%Divryne> SHH.
[1:03:35] <%DavidSanChan> Mr Li, why you no wear uniform
[1:03:38] <BeastlyP1ays> @AngriestPat not a big comic book fan so hows the game so far
[1:03:38] <%stigna1> Hullo friends, what's goin on round here?
[1:03:39] <%pennykettle_> Hey, Beter
[1:03:41] <+Tylermcd93> idk who Mr. Negative is
[1:03:41] <+fFailureatlife> i really like mr li
[1:03:41] <$Totally_not_toby> Mr. Li is Hannibal Smith in diguise
[1:03:42] <mayorrev> suspicious
[1:03:42] <+JenovasPuppet> Mr Li is Mister Positive
[1:03:44] <@SSaryn> I sure hope Mr. Li isn't hiding SOME DEEP DARK SECRET FROM ME
[1:03:46] <Coystick> BETER BARKER
[1:03:48] <HoIlywood_SN> @SailingSaturn i think it looks genuinely good yeah
[1:03:49] <ukokira> Oh W o W
[1:03:51] <lloyddboy> Mr Negative's his brother, WaluiLi
[1:03:55] <SilverInferno3> According to Peter he's never had more than 100 dollars
[1:03:55] <windaar241> hey guys!
[1:03:57] <ukokira> Pat's still really early in the story
[1:03:57] <kwangalang> LUL art
[1:03:59] <%badchoice5> lol, Art History
[1:04:03] <+jorgamund> is that B. D. Wong?
[1:04:04] <ape_hawk> is mr. negative like an actual comic book villain?
[1:04:04] <%Trekalone> I mean, he's about to be evicted so a homeless shelter isn't the worst place for him to be
[1:04:06] <SilverInferno3> Which is weird because it contradicts his rent
[1:04:06] <Endocrom> Soooo it's Spider-Man's fault that he's Mr. Negative
[1:04:06] <bear_breaker20> lmoa @lloyddboy
[1:04:08] <person181> that is a cool mask
[1:04:11] <+JenovasPuppet> "I mean I have no idea!"
[1:04:13] <$ImasukyLomae> Me. Li is the goodest person ever
[1:04:15] <%Rostichenburg> Yes Mr Negative is in the comics
[1:04:17] <Austin0097> @SSaryn Especially if that secret was negative in some way or another.
[1:04:19] <mercado94> Super evi'
[1:04:20] <ukokira> Mt Negative is fairly recentish
[1:04:20] <EMP_Ike_Turner> some sick ass shit
[1:04:21] <SilverInferno3> Akuuuuma
[1:04:21] <alexandrecau> akuma
[1:04:22] <Demon_chann> that mask dosent have eyeholes
[1:04:23] <%Rostichenburg> he creates Anti-Venom
[1:04:23] <%pennykettle_> Too cowardly to say Oni
[1:04:24] <kwangalang> wait , that mask has no eyeholes ...
[1:04:24] <dmysta3000> FORESHADOWING
[1:04:24] <DashXero> There are no holes in that mask.
[1:04:27] <puppydogcity> oh god hes ugly as fuck
[1:04:28] <LtThunderbolt> dope mask is dope
[1:04:28] <Demon_chann> how did they see?
[1:04:30] <mayorrev> 👀
[1:04:31] <%mister___doctor> Hmmm I dunno guys this guy seems suspicious for some reason
[1:04:32] <DashXero> How do they see?
[1:04:34] <%craig_t> @AngriestPat do you know anything about Mr Negative in the comments? At least from what I recall he had the whole "evil alternate personality with spereate memories" thing going on
[1:04:35] <$MightyMaxT> "Yes, Father. I shall become a Demon."
[1:04:35] <nzrai> it's bad mojo
[1:04:36] <+shawntk_> Mr Negative was added in like 2006/2007
[1:04:39] <ape_hawk> in what tier does mr. negative fall in? B tier? C?
[1:04:39] <dewyweb> like who?
[1:04:39] <+SparkAfterDark> The hear and THEN they see
[1:04:45] <%SuperCasualBoom> He put it on and becomes “The Mask” SMOKING!!
[1:04:45] <Kenny2113> it`s like Li and mr Negative are the same person... nah that`s crazy
[1:04:50] <mercado94> Who???
[1:04:54] <+fFailureatlife> hes pretty new
[1:04:54] <nzrai> i bet this mj is perpetually in trouble
[1:04:55] <potaytoh> YES, LEAVE THE DEMONS ALONE.
[1:04:56] <mayorrev> LI PLEASE
[1:04:58] <dsauce999> Nah she is now tho
[1:04:59] <ALLHAILTHEBENNY> *SMILE*
[1:04:59] <Niney_Who> RED FLAG
[1:05:01] <JDebss> He's totally wearing that later
[1:05:05] <+xxviios> This is SO well acted
[1:05:07] <bear_breaker20> let me just hype up my own gang real quick
[1:05:07] <+fFailureatlife> i really like him
[1:05:11] <%badchoice5> This story could go to...NEGATIVE places
[1:05:12] <+TheBigO75> but why take the risk MENENCING
[1:05:13] <dmysta3000> NAAAAHHH
[1:05:14] <%DrFacilier> I wish the trailers didnt show him as the villain
[1:05:16] <%SaltyDongs> you don't know what your messin with
[1:05:16] <$Totally_not_toby> NAAAHHHH
[1:05:18] <+jayfigga> No. But thanks for telling me who was sneaking around
[1:05:20] <Austin0097> @ape_hawk Before this game I would have put him at a low C, but after it I would put him at a really high B.
[1:05:23] <%lulzysavant> sketti
[1:05:25] <wired_soul> white rose
[1:05:27] <Niney_Who> SPAGHET
[1:05:27] <mayorrev> lotsa spaghetti
[1:05:29] <Fruitywhompus> sketti dinner
[1:05:30] <ukokira> I mean it's fairly obvious even without the trailer
[1:05:30] <officerjeffersondavis> spider spaghetti
[1:05:31] <Endocrom> Give radioactive blood, Peter
[1:05:32] <hntronium> MOMS PASGHETTI
[1:05:33] <+fFailureatlife> hes trying to get people he cares about away from the fallout
[1:05:35] <ape_hawk> how is DEMON a catchy name?
[1:05:36] <Demon_chann> im gonna be honest with you guys i kinda hate MJ on this game
[1:05:37] <Naho_Saenoki> I'm pretty sure Li doesn't know he's Mr. Negative.
[1:05:37] <%pennykettle_> @DrFacilier the entire e3 sequence spoils an otherwise great part of the game
[1:05:38] <%DavidSanChan> candy spaghetti
[1:05:38] <cerberuscarmine> DO YOU NEED JUSTICE?!
[1:05:38] <ape_hawk> its so generic
[1:05:40] <%Rostichenburg> MJ is insane she keeps complaining that Peter doesn't want her fighting gangs with assault rifles
[1:05:41] <+TheBigO75> Spags
[1:05:42] <sosuke5> Do you need JUSTICE?
[1:05:42] <Sinister_Aglet> if only pat could boil water
[1:05:42] <$MonsterEnvy> cheer200 Mr Negative in the comics is actully a split personalty of Li. So Li is good, but Negative is Evil. Also his gang's name is really cool. The Inner Demons.
[1:05:42] <Austin0097> P I Z Z A - T I M E
[1:05:44] <potaytoh> people put sketti dinners up on fliers in America? I have it like every week LUL
[1:05:44] <EMP_Ike_Turner> I CAN BREAK THESE CUFFS
[1:05:44] <SilverInferno3> @DrFacilier Ikr, they build this whole thing up in the first act but the trailers ruin it
[1:05:44] <%ArcanumMBD> @angriestpat fun facts: you can air juggle enemies with web like Dante. Also slamming or throwing a webbed enemy into a surface will insta KO them
[1:05:46] <dekkitout> toucha tha spaghet
[1:05:47] <%SuperCasualBoom> I could go pasta right now
[1:05:48] <lloyddboy> DAYTIME
[1:05:49] <%pennykettle_> @Demon_chann booo get of the stage
[1:05:50] <mayorrev> @AngriestPat there are some pizza joints around NY that play the spiderman 2 pizza theme
[1:05:50] <+SparkAfterDark> all spaghetti is made with spiders
[1:05:52] <+aznjackh> is mr negative a split personality like two face or is it one person?
[1:05:53] <Vyctorian> Heyy
[1:05:54] <%Remery_> With REAL MEATBALLS and not meat sauce >.>
[1:05:55] <mayorrev> no joke
[1:05:56] <JDebss> SPAGHET
[1:05:56] <321Continue> Pat you dont even know how to boil WATER
[1:05:57] <$Totally_not_toby> YOU CANT BREAK THOSE CUFFS
[1:05:57] <%lulzysavant> apatLiz
[1:06:02] <Niney_Who> @MonsterEnvy "Inner Demons" ... I finished the entire game and never understood that was what it meant
[1:06:07] <mayorrev> yaaay
[1:06:08] <EMP_Ike_Turner> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
[1:06:10] <ape_hawk> so mr. negative is like the two-face of marvel? neat
[1:06:10] <+JenovasPuppet> To be fair, it's obvious in the same way it's obvious Otto will become Doc Ock. We already know these characters.
[1:06:10] <dekkitout> sun go up
[1:06:11] <ukokira> It's a split personality in the comics
[1:06:11] <mayorrev> bright sunny day c:
[1:06:13] <HoIlywood_SN> oh yeah, @AngriestPat theres pizza shops that play the meme pizza theme from spider-man 2
[1:06:19] <ukokira> But it's slightly different in the game
[1:06:19] <Sinister_Aglet> lol
[1:06:20] <+QuadraticGravity> LUL
[1:06:22] <CrystalDiglett> DAMN IT PAT
[1:06:24] <Darmarock> дьфщ

[1:06:24] <undeuxtroisqua> sun go up pat go down
[1:06:28] <%Rostichenburg> I can't tell if it's supposed to be a split personality here
[1:06:31] <%evilmagetim> Spide-quests
[1:06:32] <+TheBigO75> what work
[1:06:32] <Fujiwara_92> LUL NOTHING TO DO
[1:06:32] <SatansDick1> almost broke the game
[1:06:33] <cerberuscarmine> YAY
[1:06:34] <Darmarock> -__-
[1:06:37] <+SparkAfterDark> don't you want to explore the city to find some collectibles?
[1:06:38] <Tisaric> I was about to say
[1:06:39] <$ImasukyLomae> ruined
[1:06:45] <ukokira> I don't think it's really a split personality in the game
[1:06:45] <ape_hawk> OH BOY THIS ONE
[1:06:45] <%Farples> Pat briefly had that look as if he made a terrible mistake
[1:06:46] <lloyddboy> CHECK sPIDERTWITTER
[1:06:46] <Kenny2113> quest new
[1:06:47] <%Sirculbs> Wharf
[1:06:47] <+fFailureatlife> and it makes me really sad that Li is a bad guy cuz hes such a good guy
[1:06:50] <%nitronLVIII> thank goodness for distractions
[1:06:50] <ape_hawk> THIS ONE IS GREAT
[1:06:52] <+Walopoh> This is the best suit imo
[1:06:52] <mayorrev> wait is that island in the middle all you can explore?
[1:06:53] <cerberuscarmine> he found all the collectables @SparkAfterDark
[1:06:54] <%badchoice5> I just realized, 8 years of being Spiderman and Doc Oc still hasn't happened yet
[1:06:54] <Noelle808> I wonder if sidequests get locked out.
[1:06:55] <+TheBigO75> yo homecoming suit
[1:06:56] <%ginger__gaming__> If you're out of content to do in the city it gives you the main quest again after about 5-10 minutes
[1:06:56] <MrPedrovsky> @sparkafterdark i think he already got them all off stream
[1:06:57] <@SSaryn> oooooh boi best side quest in the game about to be done.
[1:07:01] <mayorrev> or are there multiple parts?
[1:07:03] <Naho_Saenoki> @aznjackh Two separate personalities, with different powers, even. Li can heal people just being around them or touching them, and Mr. Negative corrupts people.
[1:07:11] <dabirSA> more like spidequestd
[1:07:14] <+jorgamund> this game is a legit technical achievement
[1:07:17] <ape_hawk> totalbiscuit is spinning in his grave
[1:07:19] <wsintai> Motion Blur is the worst
[1:07:21] <%korth367> was mgs5 30 or 60?
[1:07:23] <%Rostichenburg> There seems to be a couple of really obvious missing suits
[1:07:23] <bear_breaker20> was there any details for what new game+ is gonna add?
[1:07:23] <ukokira> In the game it's more like a... uhhh
[1:07:24] <JDebss> Motion blur is garbo
[1:07:29] <HoIlywood_SN> MGSV was 30
[1:07:30] <mayorrev> nooooo
[1:07:32] <$Mornaka> @mayorrev thats it but its a big island
[1:07:34] <+SparkAfterDark> Sarcasm
[1:07:35] <zal_silverfang> @ape_hawk ouch
[1:07:35] <ukokira> Drug condition? But without the drug requirement part
[1:07:35] <PhearoGuille> but motion blur is still here tho
[1:07:36] <potaytoh> @wsintai I turn it off in every game I get LUL

[1:07:55] <Austin0097> @AngriestPat I think this is easily one of the best looking games this generation, especially for an open world game.
[1:07:55] <+TheDeadpoolDash> you going to do any creepy cringe selfies in game with the spooder man?
[1:07:57] <Niney_Who> I love how Generous this aunt may is, she's not just useless

[1:17:16] <SatansDick1> he kicked ass
[1:17:16] <%craig_t> and beat up some drug dealers
[1:17:16] <Niney_Who> He should be a firefighter then
[1:17:18] <ALLHAILTHEBENNY> True essence of a hero
[1:17:19] <+Tylermcd93> and stopped drug dealers
[1:17:19] <CatmanIX> with karate and a fire extinguisher
[1:17:19] <%DavidSanChan> follow him

[1:17:22] <%john_fukerbutt> but he could just do that he dosnt need the suit
[1:17:23] <Sochin_Iitsu> Just send him to hang out with the Avengers
[1:17:23] <Austin0097> @AngriestPat He also beat up tons of criminals.
[1:17:23] <Scrumpledorph> Why not just be a vigilante who isn't spiderman?
[1:17:24] <JDebss> And he went on to become Tony Stark
[1:17:25] <Kenny2113> and then he joined Overwatch
[1:17:25] <+jorgamund> guy did 3 heroic things while spidey took a call from an old guy
[1:17:26] <Fujiwara_92> MATT MERCER SPIDEY IS A HERO
[1:17:26] <%Remery_> take selfi with him?
[1:17:26] <$Mornaka> It is but he can do it without the suit @AngriestPat

[1:17:28] <Jason4567890> And stop a drug deal
[1:17:29] <Demon_chann> HE GOT THE TALENT
[1:17:29] <+doc_ock_rokc> Dude is arguably brave then Spiderman
[1:17:30] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> and refused to kill people like Uncle Ben wanted
[1:17:30] <Niney_Who> Now check the upgrade Under the Throw you got
[1:17:30] <SirSmudgey> follow him, see if he despawns
[1:17:33] <%CurrySauseBandit> From a fire, stopped a mugging, AND stopped a drug deal.
[1:17:33] <+JenovasPuppet> He did big good. Just get him a different suit and he could be a new hero.
[1:17:37] <%korth367> HE COULD BE THE PUNISHER OR SOMETHING IDK
[1:17:38] <%Remery_> Take selfie with him?
[1:17:41] <$MonsterEnvy> @AngriestPat Spiderman said he was doing good
[1:17:42] <mercado94> Hes an Avenger
[1:17:42] <sosuke5> He should have gotten One for All instead of Deku
[1:17:44] <bear_breaker20> he fucked up a dude with a rocket launcher
[1:17:44] <%badchoice5> He should use his Crime tokens to upgrade his suit
[1:17:45] <%TheLuckyWatcher> he did well up until guns were involved
[1:17:45] <reonome> black belt man!
[1:17:46] <+jaguarkek318> Just go be Moon Knight
[1:17:47] <$MonsterEnvy> Just he was going to die
[1:17:47] <+xxviios> He dont need a suit to do that
[1:17:49] <kwangalang> he is also a literal dude with no special powers
[1:17:50] <Austin0097> @xXCrustybunsXx It's actually Iron Fist... probably.
[1:17:50] <Rngiddion> Dude should be a volunteer firefighter then
[1:17:52] <+Walopoh> Now if he used guns he basically is the Punisher
[1:17:58] <+TheDeadpoolDash> that wasn't Flash Thompson pretending to be Spider-Man was it?
[1:18:00] <Coystick> Give Spider-Man a gun
[1:18:04] <%Cynful_Pleasures> Literally which other one.
[1:18:04] <Kaitepaints> My great grandfather saved a baby from a burning building when he was 13
[1:18:06] <+doc_ock_rokc> He is the Mumen Rider of Marvel
[1:18:07] <%Cynful_Pleasures> There's so many
[1:18:09] <+TheBigO75> Noir has a gun
[1:18:11] <Sochin_Iitsu> If there's something Spider Man 3 taught me, it's never travel THROUGH Central Park
[1:18:12] <%Remery_> so take off all your clothes
[1:18:14] <%SaltyDongs> Great they are all late always
[1:18:14] <Austin0097> Give Iron Fist a gun.

[1:18:47] <%Remery_> JJJ as Spiderman DLC when?
[1:18:53] <MrPedrovsky> Is there an actual Spider-Punisher?
[1:18:54] <thelonechris> The hero we all deserve

[1:19:09] <%rdark_ksu> hes never technically totally wrong tho
[1:19:09] <+TheDeadpoolDash> it would have been neat since Flash does idolize Spidey
[1:19:09] <Niney_Who> What if JJJ Got the Venom symbiote
[1:19:10] <Endocrom> Radioactive semen making the frogs gay!
[1:19:12] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> JJJ never starts a podcast Mute

[1:19:24] <+SparkAfterDark> The punisher lives in the past. The day his family died.
[1:19:24] <%john_fukerbutt> what if jj became the punisher
[1:19:29] <%Remery_> JJJ would never say Mini Gorf
[1:19:30] <%Rostichenburg> Wherever there is crime to punish
[1:19:31] <Austin0097> I want them to add the Raimi Spider-Man suit, but it's not the full version, just the one with JK Simmons from that deleted scene in Spider-Man 2.
[1:19:31] <%mister___doctor> On the next podcast can all three of you just bitch about Spiderman for 4 hours
[1:19:33] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> .....Is Fisk Tower in the same spot they used the Oscorp Building in the San Raimi movies....?
[1:19:33] <Village10> flash thomson given when this games takes place should be overseas doing a war before he gets his legs blown off, guy who asjed
[1:19:34] <+xXCrustybunsXx> There should be a JJJ DLC where you play as him as he makes up a heroic tale
[1:19:34] <CrystalDiglett> @AngriestPat you can find the Wakanda embassy somewhere in the game.
[1:19:44] <321Continue> @niney_who i think theres an outtake in the raimi movies where jjj wears the suit
[1:19:47] <+Meekest> JJJ as the Punisher would want pictures of his dead family
[1:19:48] <+doc_ock_rokc> JJJ would totally say Mini Gorf then deny it like a madman

[1:28:30] <puppydogcity> bikkuri shita
[1:28:31] <ukokira> @angriestpat Every time Spiderman talks in game including every conversation , he has two different voice tracks depending on wether he's fighting or web swinging, or just walking around
[1:28:33] <$MightyMaxT> I think you can unlock a new suit @AngriestPat
[1:28:36] <CrystalDiglett> ALL HE DOES IS ROB BANKS
[1:28:36] <zal_silverfang> DAMNIT
[1:28:37] <KnivesEve> rey mysteryo

[1:28:43] <+Thorn14> I dont think you should skip them
[1:28:44] <%Rostichenburg> Mysterio can hypnotise but that's about it
[1:28:44] <LewLewLew> Follow mal'ganis to the ends of the earth?
[1:28:46] <SailingSaturn> But I loved 90's Spider-man Finale it was great
[1:28:46] <Kataguro> Shoot smog web into Shocker's face
[1:28:47] <Sochin_Iitsu> Well don't watch Jim Sterling's review if you don't want Mysterio spoilers
[1:28:47] <+Thorn14> and they aren't long
[1:28:48] <%PatNTheHat> Watch it be Otto that's working with Shocker or some shit
[1:28:50] <zal_silverfang> you are here now pat just do them

[1:29:06] <CrystalDiglett> OOF
[1:29:08] <%badchoice5> Oh man, if the whole fight were just knocking him out in a cutscene
[1:29:12] <Demon_chann> LOOKS COOL
[1:29:13] <+Thorn14> Shocker is so cool here.
[1:29:14] <Fruitywhompus> oof
[1:29:14] <reonome> he just went back to robbing banks???
[1:29:15] <+goldenwerewolf> Okay Bane moon2M
[1:29:17] <Sochin_Iitsu> LET'S RUMBLE
[1:29:17] <xxgoth_holicxx> omg they made shocker a villain?
[1:29:21] <bear_breaker20> punch his jaw off peter
[1:29:24] <mayorrev> ROUND 1
[1:29:24] <%rdark_ksu> Peter you god damn nerd
[1:29:25] <Demon_chann> WHY ARE YOU SOO COOL SHOCKER?
[1:29:33] <viewtifulr> all this money runied
[1:29:41] <+SparkAfterDark> I love that no matter how cool his suit gets there's still that stupid fucking quilted part
[1:29:42] <ALLHAILTHEBENNY> LOTTA DAMAGE
[1:29:44] <dekkitout> shocker-chan, y u do dis
[1:29:44] <iwa5h4ck3d> Shocker stole some Stark tech for his suit
[1:29:45] <mayorrev> WHO?
[1:29:47] <Sochin_Iitsu> Shocking
[1:29:47] <+xXCrustybunsXx> Shocke is mad because hes not part of sinister six LUL
[1:29:51] <Austin0097> Shocker has already been one of my favorite Spider-Man villains after the first Sam Raimi move game.
[1:29:53] <lightsinx98> go to otto's lab and do the chemicals
[1:29:57] <CrystalDiglett> This version of shocker is actually really cool
[1:29:58] <Village10> i like the quilted part
[1:30:00] <Niney_Who> Yeah pat WHO IS Z TIER NOW
[1:30:03] <Cosairen> shocker with permanent gold burst
[1:30:09] <hitorio> If you don't hit him after he says "you talk too much," Spidey continues talking incessantly to troll, and I like what he has to say'
[1:30:09] <$TheNeedlesD> Actual boss fights in a modern super hero game?
[1:30:09] <bear_breaker20> SPIDERMAN IS A MENACE FIGHTING IN A BANK TAKE IT OUTSIDE - J Jonah
[1:30:12] <HoIlywood_SN> @SparkAfterDark to be fair that serves a practical purpose, its so he doesnt fuck himself up from his gauntlet vibrations
[1:30:19] <dekkitout> he's so z tier, he's SS tier
[1:30:21] <Niney_Who> You can't spell Impatient without Pat
[1:30:24] <kwangalang> ive never respected shocker, he isnt a threat at all
[1:30:36] <JDebss> The money tho
[1:30:37] <+fFailureatlife> shocker is great
[1:30:44] <+Tylermcd93> What does shocker need the money for tho
[1:30:45] <+goldenwerewolf> Is Shocker's power the literal power of fart gas?
[1:30:47] <%Rostichenburg> He's about as much of a threat as most spider-man villains
[1:30:48] <Demon_chann> LOVE YOU SHOCKER
[1:30:51] <+fFailureatlife> look at this threat
[1:30:59] <HoIlywood_SN> Shocker is a weird villain because he's somehow gotten this reputation as a loser when he's kicked Spider-Mans ass more than like any other villain
[1:31:00] <AncelDeLambert> peter is causing more monetary damages to this bank by fighting shocker here than if he had just let him take off with the cash
[1:31:02] <Sochin_Iitsu> Man, if only Spider Man had a some sort of ... swinging power to get out of the way
[1:31:04] <Cosairen> shockers is so much cooler than electro
[1:31:11] <+SparkAfterDark> Yeah. His shockwaves that can blast through a 3ft thick safe door are nullified by half an inch of grama's favorite quilt
[1:31:15] <%Rostichenburg> No shocker shoots vibrations
[1:31:17] <%badchoice5> Can you imagine Spiderman, but with Shocker's suit?
[1:31:18] <%Dmorktry> Pat, how the hell do you keep getting hit by his ground pound
[1:31:18] <dekkitout> if spider-man has the black suit, shocker-chan would beat the christ out of them
[1:31:20] <+doc_ock_rokc> Shocker is actually a good Z tear villian
[1:31:20] <Clinnamon> Shocker would actually be pretty formidable opponent for most people that aren't Spider-Man
[1:31:26] <+fFailureatlife> gotem
[1:31:30] <+Thorn14> Yeah I dont like Jobber Shocker
[1:31:31] <Kataguro> Nice job, Peter
[1:31:32] <+Tylermcd93> @AncelDeLambert That's a plot point in Incredibles
[1:31:33] <$Totally_not_toby> >implying day trading is robbery
[1:31:35] <+Thorn14> The dude fires Shockwaves
[1:31:40] <HoIlywood_SN> @SparkAfterDark well thats because thats the directed blast, but theres still the aftershock from the engine in the gauntlets
[1:31:48] <$Totally_not_toby> spidey is just mad he doesn't know The Secrets
[1:31:49] <iwa5h4ck3d> 8 years and still dont know shockers weakness
[1:31:50] <Coystick> This sequence...Shocked me
[1:31:55] <%Rostichenburg> Symbiote is only weak to sonics and fire shocker shoots air
[1:32:04] <Cosairen> @iwa5h4ck3d they said this is a new suit
[1:32:06] <JDebss> Come ON Herman
[1:32:07] <Huntercd> He's talking now though
[1:32:09] <+Thorn14> Shocker would be a hard counter to Venom yeah lmao
[1:32:10] <%badchoice5> This must be one of those fights you HAVE to lose
[1:32:14] <+fFailureatlife> this was a good fight
[1:32:16] <Kataguro> Peter, YOU'RE wearing a mask
[1:32:17] <CrystalDiglett> Ah the Dmeons
[1:32:20] <%badchoice5> Shocker cannot be stopped
[1:32:20] <mayorrev> whoopsies
[1:32:21] <CrystalDiglett> Demons*
[1:32:22] <%SaltyDongs> OHHHH
[1:32:22] <Kataguro> That's not a big clue
[1:32:25] <HoIlywood_SN> @SparkAfterDark think how like a big speaker with bass you can feel the vibration from a ways away even if you cant hear the music itself
[1:32:27] <rosemon5001> CHINA CONFIRMED NOT PEOPLE
[1:32:28] <%Dmorktry> he did it!
[1:32:29] <Arek_1> @sparkafterdark Oh, I think Shocker is actually wearing a type of gambeson.
[1:32:35] <Demon_chann> the fact they are having a conversation is great
[1:32:48] <Sochin_Iitsu> I love that Shocker's such a loser he'll just give info away for free
[1:32:54] <Kataguro> use Maximum Spider
[1:33:01] <Kenny2113> it`d be cool if shockproof suit had some interactions with this fights with Shocker
[1:33:14] <JDebss> What a jobber
[1:33:16] <+SparkAfterDark> or maybe he's going to keep the nonsensical quilting because at somepoint it sorta made sense but now it's a design detail associated with the character.
[1:33:17] <HoIlywood_SN> @Kenny2113 thats an insulated suit, Shocker uses shockwaves
[1:33:27] <viewtifulr> fight together? I know it wont happen but its never all the warriors
[1:33:31] <Belutima> Look at all this collateral dmg
[1:33:32] <Kataguro> Dead
[1:33:33] <+willtheprofessional> F
[1:33:35] <+doc_ock_rokc> Dead

[1:33:42] <EMP_Ike_Turner> M U R D E R
[1:33:42] <%badchoice5> there go his legs
[1:33:42] <Clinnamon> maybe shocker just likes comfy quilts man
[1:33:44] <mayorrev> fuckin talk to him
[1:33:46] <%ginger__gaming__> Shocking
[1:33:48] <Austin0097> DED

[1:33:51] <ape_hawk> NO, HE DIDNT
[1:33:52] <+fFailureatlife> hes great
[1:33:52] <%goose_attack_almanac> SHOCKMASTER
[1:33:54] <Sochin_Iitsu> And then Spiderman donated all his money to... oh.
[1:33:55] <zal_silverfang> broken spine
[1:33:55] <ape_hawk> YOU DID THAT, PETER
[1:34:00] <+Tylermcd93> shockers the best
[1:34:01] <medril07> you killed him with the earth
[1:34:01] <%Hilleltaco> Doing stuff like that always seemed risky, like you're just hoping he can handle having that dropped on him
[1:34:04] <AncelDeLambert> time for JJJ to call Spidey a menace, and be right
[1:34:05] <Arek_1> @sparkafterdark Gambeson is padded armor. Great against cuts and I'm sure it helps with the aftershock from his blasts.
[1:34:07] <McCune> hes awesome
[1:34:07] <iwa5h4ck3d> new suit protected his spine 4Head
[1:34:07] <Demon_chann> HES NOT STUPID HE JUST NEED TO TRY HARDER NEXT TIME
[1:34:11] <+GingerTwerk213> Shocker but the shockmaster
[1:34:13] <EMP_Ike_Turner> *PLEDGE OF DEMON INTENSIFIES*
[1:34:14] <+Thorn14> More damage to the bank than if he had actually just fucking robbed the place.
[1:34:18] <+fFailureatlife> see not dead
[1:34:28] <%ginger__gaming__> @Thorn14 JJJ was right

[1:36:30] <%Mawarup> Thanks Pat for streaming when I get off of work its rare to see my favorite streamer up during the weekdays.
[1:36:31] <hitorio> Such extremely divisive opinions on these suits. I wonder why this is
[1:36:31] <%TheSniperJoe> Nothing is better than Web Blossom.
[1:36:32] <NeetKiller> Scarlet spider is the best
[1:36:33] <+Llyrumi> Homecoming suit looks good
[1:36:33] <KnivesEve> boo
[1:36:33] <Clinnamon> I've stuck with 2099 since I got it, Miguel's always had the sickest Spidey suit
[1:36:38] <%PatNTheHat> Electrically insulated suit looks like Spider-Vauban
[1:36:38] <+TheBigO75> woo
[1:36:39] <+The_Fancy_Fenneq> The Noir Suit is my personal favorite

[1:36:48] <Endocrom> Not totally negative, He would be green and orange
[1:36:49] <Cosairen> miguel is the best
[1:36:51] <%TheSniperJoe> You get MUCH closer.
[1:36:52] <%DrFacilier> looks straight outta Human Revolution
[1:36:54] <hitorio> I've never seen so many "looks fantastic" and "looks like shit" on one set of costumes before
[1:36:55] <DashXero> Hehehehe.....
[1:36:56] <Demon_chann> @The_Fancy_Fenneq Good taste
[1:36:57] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> What if Black Panther was covered with a Symbiote?
[1:36:59] <DXLelouch24> WRONG
[1:36:59] <+xxviios> Daft Spider
[1:37:01] <Sinister_Aglet> can't see shit cap'n
[1:37:02] <ScoldingHotFire> thank god you can switch powers on suits
[1:37:02] <LovableCastiel> looks so nice
[1:37:05] <+eldritchbee> Negative Suit looks like AntiVenom
[1:37:06] <HoIlywood_SN> @Clinnamon it also has the sickest backstory of any spider-man costume in that its a Day of The Dead costume
[1:37:06] <ukokira> W r o n g
[1:37:07] <Niney_Who> The Skill under Throw makes it stronger, you essentially do the Arkham thing of Punching them on the floor to KO them
[1:37:08] <+SparkAfterDark> I reiterate. You just wanna look like Anubis in any way any chance you get
[1:37:10] <dekkitout> thats been done atleast 5 times @Breakfast_Megapowers
[1:37:11] <cerberuscarmine> shhhh
[1:37:12] <%Rostichenburg> 2099 is really good
[1:37:15] <%lols_royce> its weird how the game auto corrects your swings low to the ground
[1:37:15] <potaytoh> DO NERD STUFF
[1:37:15] <zal_silverfang> @Breakfast_Megapowers there might be a story of that somewhere
[1:37:17] <%SolitudeOtM> I'm disappointed by the lack of bright glowing neon on that suit
[1:37:22] <Skelefew> I personally like the Woolie suite aka Big Time suit.

[1:39:49] <EMP_Ike_Turner> ...the confederate president?
[1:39:49] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> @angriestpat You’re gonna get a SHIT TON of more sidequests, man.

[1:39:53] <dmysta3000> Time for Miles dad!
[1:39:53] <thebeatsandrhymes> Yeah once you stop 5 crimes in NYC that area just goes “nah fuck that”
[1:39:54] <+Cobalt_Racer> JEFF
[1:39:55] <+SparkAfterDark> The only difference between heroes and villains is that heroes fail their crime shit and turn to superscience to help them fight crime. Villains fail to do science good, and turn to crime to fund more science doing.
[1:39:56] <Kenny2113> Miles dad Pog
[1:39:57] <%badchoice5> If J Jonah Jameson was right about the gang war, then what if he's right about vaccines and chemtrails!?
[1:39:57] <wydamn> You gotta put those demons in demon jail
[1:40:01] <Fujiwara_92> SPIDER DAD TIMS
[1:40:07] <Huntercd> Why would they name him Jefferson Davis?!
[1:40:07] <Axlbullet> No spider-time dodging Pat?
[1:40:14] <mayorrev> do some air tricks
[1:40:17] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Still incredibly perplexed why the comic writer decided to name the black spiderman's dad JEFFERSON DAVIS
[1:40:18] <HoIlywood_SN> i heard this game actually makes Miles interesting which is an impressive feat considering how boring and nothing he is in everything else ever
[1:40:21] <+JenovasPuppet> According to Kotaku, Jefferson Davis should be a corrupt asshole.
[1:40:33] <+SolidusRex> Demon's are out of GENTLEMEN
[1:40:36] <ukokira> It's not really that impressive
[1:40:40] <AncelDeLambert> according to Kotaku, no fun is allowed
[1:40:40] <Sochin_Iitsu> ...Then why'd you call it an ATM?
[1:40:43] <ukokira> Miles has always had tons of potential
[1:40:48] <%TheSniperJoe> cheer200 Hey Pat, fun fact. Did you know the voice actress and facial capture actress for Black Cat is the same as Futaba from Persona 5? Erica Lindbeck is pretty damn talented. As a side note, you should do ALL of her side missions if you like dressing in dope suits.
[1:40:49] <ukokira> It's just been wasted super hard before
[1:40:52] <Endocrom> [ He moves like Jackie Chan ]
[1:40:55] <+fFailureatlife> what did kotaku do now?
[1:40:58] <Mr_Strut> I find it hard to believe that Shocker is afraid of these losers.

[1:41:05] <Cosairen> anyone know what dialect that is? i wanna say cantonese but im not well versed

[1:41:34] <%Rostichenburg> This is the mark 2 spider-armour made to fight the sinister 6
[1:41:34] <CrystalDiglett> black panther made it
[1:41:34] <+Meekest> Comics
[1:41:34] <SirSmudgey> isn't that spiderman 2099?
[1:41:34] <dekkitout> could be original
[1:41:34] <HoIlywood_SN> @AngriestPat its from when he lost his spider-sense
[1:41:36] <+fFailureatlife> a comic
[1:41:36] <Darkrun2> Dan Slott's early run on AMS
[1:41:37] <cant_pick_a_name> damn Pat started this one late
[1:41:38] <$MightyMaxT> It's a Bulletproof armor from like 2010/2011?

[1:41:42] <TerraWraith> The very ass end of the last movie
[1:41:42] <Fujiwara_92> NOWHERE
[1:41:45] <SatansDick1> when he lost his powers
[1:41:46] <+Thorn14> Pat apparently its from main canon where he lost his powers
[1:41:48] <+xXCrustybunsXx> Its an upgraded iron spider suit
[1:41:48] <HoIlywood_SN> @AngriestPat he lost his spider-sense and was worried about being shot in the face
[1:41:49] <Endocrom> MkII, guessing Iron Man
[1:41:49] <%Rostichenburg> It's an armoured spider suit
[1:41:50] <Demon_chann> i know the speed suit is orginal
[1:41:50] <EBT93> It’s OC
[1:41:50] <potaytoh> I'd say it's more likely that it's Mandarin. Only nerds speak Cantonese.
[1:41:51] <AncelDeLambert> @ffailureatlife Kotaku bitched AGAIN about games not being political enough and that the cops should've all been corrupt caricatures
[1:41:53] <+Thorn14> so he needed a armored spider suit
[1:41:54] <%Meme_Platinum> @AngriestPat it's OC
[1:41:54] <dalishprince> !uptime
[1:41:54] <%TheSniperJoe> He built it to stop a dude named Massacre.
[1:41:54] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 41m 56s.
[1:41:55] <SecretFawf> Amazing Spider-Man #656 (1999)
[1:41:56] <iwa5h4ck3d> Its from Spiderman 3
[1:41:58] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> Apparently it’s original
[1:42:00] <+fFailureatlife> sounds fun
[1:42:03] <+HostilePoundcakes> i think it was when he lost his spider sense for a while and had to beef up his suit
[1:42:03] <wydamn> that's from the issue spiderman's webs were replaced with mustard
[1:42:05] <SecretFawf> He made it when he lost his Spider-Sense
[1:42:06] <+doc_ock_rokc> Peter is so fabulus when it comes to costumes
[1:42:06] <mr_slaide> Dah babuh.
[1:42:08] <AtlasMcCoy> I like that the demon gang speaks chinese instead of just having an asian accent.
[1:42:09] <KiraKamixephos> It’s not original
[1:42:09] <Darkrun2> There was an edgy gun story where he needed armor back in like 2013 or some shit
[1:42:10] <SatansDick1> its when he lost his powers @AngriestPat
[1:42:15] <+doc_ock_rokc> Elmo is singing the song of his peoople
[1:42:16] <%IMDRanged> Mediocre Spider Pat
[1:42:17] <Jontman42> Peter created a second version of his Spider-Armor to compensate for the loss of his Spider-Sense, due to the fact that without this ability, he can be easily wounded by bullets.
[1:42:18] <ALLHAILTHEBENNY> At least in TAS2 it told you where the costumes where from
[1:42:18] <+SparkAfterDark> In a comic he lost his spider sense so he needed a bullet proof suit
[1:42:21] <SailingSaturn> @AngriestPat from when Peter lost his spider sense
[1:42:21] <CatmanIX> It's from Spider-Man 2018 on the PS4
[1:42:23] <321Continue> LUL
[1:42:28] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> I hope we get to play as Spider Gwen in this game
[1:42:28] <%IceCreamGiant> Hong Kong speaks Canto tho
[1:42:32] <%DedlokPM> @DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap Nope. It's from the comics.
[1:42:33] <%jiin6> From a clone?
[1:42:33] <+SolidusRex> Do you get crime tokens for stopping Youtube crimes?
[1:42:34] <+riqueflowers> PokScizor
[1:42:36] <%doc_coyote> PAT it's from when Spidey lost his Spidey-Sense
[1:42:37] <%PapaSatanSangLouie> Just a guess, but his story is probably something like MROW MROW SCREETCH!
[1:42:41] <%Rostichenburg> Updated from the old silver metal armour suit
[1:42:41] <Austin0097> @fFailureatlife Long story short, one of the writers at Kotaku thinks the cops are portrayed to heroic-ly, aren't corrupt enough to be realistic, and that Spider-Man shouldn't help them or be an ally.
[1:42:44] <ukokira> You'd think a bullet proof suit would have been important even when having spidey sense tbh
[1:42:45] <+Thorn14> Pat its from a time when Spiderman lost his Spider Senses, so he needed something bullet proof.
[1:42:45] <+jayfigga> Doesn’t Spider-Man lose his powers or will every year tho lol?
[1:42:49] <%goose_attack_almanac> @AngriestPat Peter Parker had that suit made after an event stripped him of his spider-sense, as without it, bullets could actually hit him. He used it to combat the mass-murderer Massacre.
[1:42:55] <%SolitudeOtM> He just murdered that guy
[1:42:57] <reonome> @icecreamgiant this is New York, not hk
[1:42:58] <Mr_Strut> Don't worry Spiderman. They're just sleeping. Upside down. And inside out.
[1:42:59] <AncelDeLambert> are those magic shields?
[1:43:05] <calder87> basically
[1:43:06] <$floridianman> GONE
[1:43:10] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> @dedlokpm Well shit, I thought it was related to something we see late in the game..
[1:43:12] <dekkitout> he lost his powers tight now in his current run SeriousSloth
[1:43:12] <fairore> isn't miles mom the one thats Spanish and not the dad
[1:43:17] <%IMDRanged> Pat is Electric Company Spiderman
[1:43:19] <%IceCreamGiant> They could be from HK
[1:43:19] <zal_silverfang> @AngriestPat MK 2 suit. Amazing Spider-Man #656
[1:43:20] <Belutima> @AngriestPat the suit is from when spiderman lost his spidersense so its bullet and grenade proof
[1:43:24] <Demon_chann> Remeneber that time where spiderman kiilled that guy?
[1:43:25] <EMP_Ike_Turner> SPIDER STING
[1:43:26] <+Thorn14> Maybe he is
[1:43:32] <SatansDick1> @AngriestPat its from when he lost spider sense
[1:43:32] <+Thorn14> But he cant swing around the city in seconds
[1:43:32] <iwa5h4ck3d> Remember when Woolie threw that guy off a building in LA Noire
[1:43:34] <McCune> he probs is
[1:43:34] <+doc_ock_rokc> Punisher is murdering them.
[1:43:35] <Admiral_PopnFresh> That Cammy leg throw is rough
[1:43:36] <wydamn> Mustard spiderman is Paige's favorite.

[1:44:05] <ukokira> There was an explanation for the avengers in this game
[1:44:06] <+Thorn14> I imagine the other new york heroes are dealing with the problems, but Spiderman is handling the biggest problem
[1:44:09] <CrystalDiglett> is this fortnite Kappa
[1:44:10] <ukokira> I forgot what it was though
[1:44:13] <+Thorn14> Avengers are in the west coast

[1:45:29] <+doc_ock_rokc> WE GETTING LORE ON FUCKING WEARHOUSES!
[1:45:29] <calder87> people shouldn't be able to see the lasers in the first place
[1:45:32] <AncelDeLambert> the attentive sniper somehow misses the sound of an object hitting the metal roofing behind him, sure
[1:45:34] <+SparkAfterDark> the lasers are only visible because spiderman's suit has goggles that can detect infrared
[1:45:34] <Coystick> @Amberizing Not far at all
[1:45:42] <Endocrom> You think Spider-Man ever accidentally sealed off a goon's air supply when he webbed them up for the cops?
[1:45:48] <Amberizing> ah yeah he's on the fisk boathouse
[1:45:49] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Sniper, noSniping!
[1:45:56] <kwangalang> @SirSmudgey lasers dont work like that in real life

[1:46:23] <+Shuckleberry_Finn> you killed him spideyy
[1:46:23] <%Rostichenburg> How'd he make that air bubble if the webs are porous
[1:46:28] <hitorio> @Endocrom he intentionally cut off a goon's air supply in the first Amazing Spider-Man movie, then slit a hole in the webbing after a bit
[1:46:31] <kwangalang> "dont let him get you airborne"
[1:46:32] <AtlasMcCoy> How does one prevent themselves from getting airborne?

[1:46:57] <+Shuckleberry_Finn> These guys seem to be in a spider-jam
[1:47:05] <Jontman42> Good job pulling those pipes Spidey
[1:47:06] <+SparkAfterDark> he can control the consistency of his webbing
[1:47:11] <%Rostichenburg> Couldn't do the stealth huh?

[1:47:42] <Demon_chann> i remenber that time where dr octopus took control over spiderman body and shot that guy in the head
[1:47:42] <HoIlywood_SN> @fairore it has something to do with his father and uncle having a criminal past and his grandmother wanting the name to continue or something
[1:47:43] <raminnoodle420> the police arrives on time
[1:47:44] <mercado94> Yeyeyeye

[2:04:52] <fairore> @rostichenburg because he liked it i get you
[2:04:53] <dmysta3000> Was that flip neccesary?
[2:04:54] <AncelDeLambert> so how did he not have the money to pay rent when he has a lucrative research position?
[2:04:55] <+Thorn14> THis mission is great
[2:04:55] <DXLelouch24> YOUR HOMELESS
[2:04:57] <DashXero> @iwa5h4ck3d I know, right?
[2:04:59] <%Rostichenburg> The best part is the land lord actually gave him a chance and Peter just fucked it up because he's an idiot
[2:04:59] <mayorrev> yoooo
[2:05:01] <mayorrev> how did he
[2:05:02] <%rdark_ksu> I dont get it but Matt really loved this mission

[2:05:16] <Austin0097> @Demon_chann I think this game absolutely nailed the small Peter moments in the game.
[2:05:16] <gyrogogozeppeli> Spidey Drive
[2:05:17] <mayorrev> SPIDEY DRIVE
[2:05:18] <DXLelouch24> spoilers its not Eddie Brock btw

[2:05:30] <+indominus_corgi> years of porn
[2:05:31] <+FrostMass22> Peter is legitimately a shitty person in this game and it's great. The one downside is that the game doesn't focus on his massive personal flaws.
[2:05:31] <Kenny2113> i mean he`s Full time Spidey, where tf he supposed to get money
[2:05:32] <+azraith> I think it is a the backup
[2:05:33] <kwangalang> like i get he is busy being spiderman but there has to be a way to not be poor
[2:05:33] <%evilmagetim> Filled with my Spidey-porn

[2:05:38] <gyrogogozeppeli> So much for being a GENIUS
[2:05:38] <+The_Fancy_Fenneq> Still better than "Batcomputer"
[2:05:39] <$Totally_not_toby> i have years of spidey-porn on there!
[2:05:39] <CrystalDiglett> pat they TOOK EVERYTHING
[2:05:40] <AncelDeLambert> dangit, Pat beat me to it

[2:05:46] <+fFailureatlife> Peter isnt a shitty person
[2:05:47] <+DakotaChip> THAT'S NOT HOW GETTING EVICTED WORKS. You have to give 30 day notice to the tenant depending on reasoning.
[2:05:47] <+CharredChord> that was his backup
[2:05:47] <+SparkAfterDark> I understand young spiderman being poor and not being able to manage his shit. But he's been doing this shit for 8 years and he still hasn't got his shit together?
[2:05:48] <%rdark_ksu> @AngriestPat Literally everything in his apt got takkken. they woulda got the back up too
[2:05:48] <+xxviios> lol
[2:05:48] <SeventyForce> SPIDER DRIVE HAS NO BACK UP, BECAUSE SPIDER DRIVE
[2:05:49] <Ran196> spiderman isn't as smart as he claims to be
[2:05:49] <+MMetas> It's allllll worthless!
[2:05:49] <+azraith> Can't put all his spidey doin's on the internet

[2:05:57] <+MechaBaphomet> All that spider porn
[2:05:58] <raminnoodle420> Spidey's that bitch that doesnt back up their shit
[2:05:59] <Noelle808> It's a good thing nobody looked at anything you own, Spidey

[2:06:01] <%goose_attack_almanac> I don't know, I paid you like three dollars to make a dumb Michael Morbius joke
[2:06:02] <fairore> @frostmass22 how is he shitty?
[2:06:02] <ape_hawk> WHICH IS WHY HE HAS TO GO TO THE DOC TOR
[2:06:02] <Cosairen> i think its more that he doesnt want some rando to find it
[2:06:03] <+jayfigga> You don’t back up Porn pat.

[2:06:22] <Niney_Who> Peter you can't have people stealing TRASH TRUCKS
[2:06:23] <%Rostichenburg> Peter is almost 30 in the comics and still can't get his shit together and Doc Ock did it in like six weeks
[2:06:23] <%DedlokPM> @DakotaChip Knowing how broke spidey usually is, he probably already had the 30 day notice. multiple times
[2:06:24] <AncelDeLambert> rhino tags, dope
[2:06:24] <$ImasukyLomae> The streams are anti value, it's costing time that could be spent doing better things. liker jerking off

[2:06:27] <HoIlywood_SN> @AngriestPat because he's a fucking Vigilante, Pat, thats ILLEGAL
[2:06:27] <+SparkAfterDark> Everything is in a file called "not porn"
[2:06:30] <wsintai> @DakotaChip He actually had been given multiple reminders; his land lord left him one at the beginning of the game, and Peter said it wasnt his first
[2:06:32] <wired_soul> trash gone

[2:07:49] <EMP_Ike_Turner> aw dang I want to believe eddie brock is in trash business
[2:07:50] <%Rostichenburg> There's a point where genius Peter Parker stops being relatable and starts just being a loser

[2:08:10] <mister_z_1994> It's not that Eddie
[2:08:10] <+Blain_Cooper> It's filled with garbage? Like what, your streams?
[2:08:12] <EMP_Ike_Turner> SPIDER-MAN RUMMAGES THROUGH YOUR GARBAGE-JJJ
[2:08:13] <Kataguro> >rally
[2:08:15] <+HajimenoStream> 3430 Boston Rd, Bronx, NY 10469
[2:08:22] <mayorrev> NO TIME FOR PIZZA
[2:08:25] <%Rostichenburg> Eddie is all over fake twitter in game too
[2:08:31] <AtlasMcCoy> So is this guy not questioning how someone can travel acrsoss the city in 10 secons?
[2:08:34] <%DavidSanChan> it's on the web
[2:08:38] <%PatNTheHat> Gonna incinerate all his nudes from Black Cat
[2:08:40] <Jontman42> In the Spidey-cloud
[2:08:43] <TerraWraith> No normal human could get there in time. He did this to fuck with you intentionally
[2:08:43] <+Shaggnar> The cloud is not secure at all though
[2:08:43] <%PapaSatanSangLouie> All his favorite porn is on the Spidey Drive!
[2:08:43] <%promo808> the SPIDEY CLOUD
[2:08:45] <%SaltyDongs> Yeah
[2:08:45] <+MMetas> It's Time for incineration! No time to have that pizza!
[2:08:47] <alexandrecau> eddie should be a spider ally
[2:08:49] <+xXCrustybunsXx> I wish Flash was in this game
[2:08:50] <wydamn> @AtlasMcCoy my thoughts exactly. Not even questioning it
[2:08:50] <+SparkAfterDark> the dude probably just assumes he's talking to spiderman
[2:08:50] <Niney_Who> Literally super-traceable
[2:08:51] <Demon_chann> @AtlasMcCoy Is new york
[2:08:51] <Endocrom> Eddie: by the way, how did you get there that fast? like you're some kind of swingy spider-guy.
[2:08:52] <%goose_attack_almanac> @PatNTheHat Can't lose those.
[2:08:57] <+MMetas> who holds up a truck
[2:08:58] <Ran196> union busting
[2:08:59] <NEOTOKYOSTREAMS> Ironically, he wouldn't want to put it on the inter-web
[2:08:59] <gyrogogozeppeli> who beats up garbage dudes?
[2:08:59] <+jayfigga> How is he not freaking out that Parker is teleporting to theses locations
[2:09:00] <+Nenatab> I bet he saved everything as webms
[2:09:00] <+MMetas> for trash
[2:09:01] <EMP_Ike_Turner> didn't pay up
[2:09:01] <%nitronLVIII> WHO ROBS THE DUMP
[2:09:02] <%shen4u> Summon the bot
[2:09:03] <Niney_Who> TRASH THIEVES
[2:09:06] <mr_slaide> Demon crime?
[2:09:06] <mayorrev> is this what really happens? evictors can toss your shit in the trash?
[2:09:07] <+Thorn14> Yeah Eddie should be like "How the fuck did you get there so fast"
[2:09:07] <gigiaten> Are they robbing garbage?
[2:09:09] <+fFailureatlife> guys its not important
[2:09:10] <SeventyForce> THE HELPFUL THUGS ARE BEATING THE EVIL TRASH MAN
[2:09:11] <%SaltyDongs> They didn't pay the dumping fee yah know
[2:09:14] <Kataguro> Thank god for this street crime
[2:09:14] <+aznjackh> why dont the avengers have a cloud?
[2:09:18] <%Rostichenburg> Spider-Man made a cloud in the comics and it got hacked almost immediately
[2:09:18] <%Kirijuo> I'm gonna steal this literal trash
[2:09:19] <$Totally_not_toby> "they keep trying to eat my garbage!"
[2:09:19] <Cosairen> of all the public servants trashmen need trouble the least
[2:09:26] <ape_hawk> WHY GO AFTER THE TRASH!?
[2:09:28] <CatmanIX> but still offsite backups man, also encryption?

[2:09:34] <+MMetas> What a lazy bum, pick up the bag spiderman
[2:09:35] <gyrogogozeppeli> just move them like a normal person!
[2:09:39] <Kataguro> That's absolutely ridiculous
[2:09:39] <Austin0097> If Peter Parker really wanted to make money he should start up a Patreon and just make parkour/swinging videos with a GoPro in-between the moments he is fighting crime.
[2:09:40] <+MMetas> stop webbing it and swinging it around
[2:09:41] <zal_silverfang> @AngriestPat just when you put in on the cloud have is tagged as "MASSIVE GAY PORN"
[2:09:42] <wired_soul> yess

[2:09:44] <s_snowball> cant he just pick them up like a normal human being

[2:10:33] <wired_soul> ice him
[2:10:34] <mayorrev> WEB BALL
[2:10:35] <+SparkAfterDark> Garbagemen not only make a lot of money, but the also find a frankly incredible amount of drugs both prescription and illegal. That's probably what they were getting shaken down for
[2:10:37] <HoIlywood_SN> ITS JUST A FUCKING PUMPKIN BOMB

[2:26:36] <SeventyForce> There's always that spider-verse uncle ben who become the spider...ben
[2:26:36] <HoIlywood_SN> @Cinder5by5 even then in hindsight, Spider-Man 3 isnt really that bad
[2:26:37] <cherubsanonymous> MUH PUDDLES
[2:26:38] <+The_Fancy_Fenneq> I think you already passed the good place to end
[2:26:39] <%Farples> Now he says that, but he'll actually stream for like 12 more hours
[2:26:39] <$MightyMaxT> Spider-Man 1 & 2 are great, 3 is fine but cluttered
[2:26:41] <+imporia_> look at how pathetic that puddle is

[2:27:07] <NEOTOKYOSTREAMS> Maybe it's just me but calling an enemy faction "The Demons" and not having them be actual demons, or at least WH40K chaos demons, is dumb

[2:28:41] <HoIlywood_SN> @Kyrill_PSN there is but its based off of concept art and not the final real building
[2:28:41] <%ginger__gaming__> Fisk is a major employer and cares about his men
[2:28:41] <+SparkAfterDark> I am FASTER THAN YOU
[2:28:43] <Magister135> The memorial tower for the WTC is in the game I beleive
[2:28:43] <deathsmions1> freedom towers there
[2:28:44] <kwangalang> did you know fisk is literally pure muscle
[2:28:46] <%korth367> kinda endearing that he cares about his goons
[2:28:47] <bear_breaker20> aww fisk is a caring dcrimelord
[2:28:49] <Grennold> @Kyrill_PSN There is but it's scuffed WTC because they couldn't get the proper rights to use it iirc
[2:28:53] <+Shuckleberry_Finn> the real demons were inside of us all along
[2:29:00] <CatmanIX> he just fucking did fisk
[2:29:02] <+xXCrustybunsXx> @Kyrill_PSN WTC?
[2:29:03] <gyrogogozeppeli> Negative shit
[2:29:04] <NEOTOKYOSTREAMS> No Peter, you are the demons
[2:29:06] <%bloodypurpledog> Fisk is a giant penis

[2:29:18] <wydamn> lol basically casting dark sorceries at you
[2:29:21] <Clinnamon> well Fisk knows he'll get out eventually, so it's just good business to make sure he has goons waiting
[2:29:21] <cherubsanonymous> Mr. Negative's powers are so damn cool
[2:29:23] <gyrogogozeppeli> Magic Shields
[2:29:23] <JDebss> Magic guns
[2:29:23] <thebeatsandrhymes> Negative powers even
[2:29:24] <%Kirijuo> It bothers me that, that guy did not look even remotely important enough to be in direct contact to Fisk
[2:29:29] <ImmaCanuck> Arkham/Sleeping Dogs combat PogChamp
[2:29:33] <CorruptDropbear> USE YOUR WEBS SPIDERMAN
[2:29:34] <+jayfigga> It’s not magic it’s the T virus

[2:29:36] <%Cinder5by5> The finishers never get old in this game
[2:29:43] <+Shuckleberry_Finn> it's a good thing their weapons are non lethal when spider man uses them
[2:29:45] <$floridianman> round the outsidde
[2:29:46] <deathsmions1> i really like how they added details to all the suits that make them fit with the art style of the world
[2:29:50] <zal_silverfang> Paige is posting skeletons again guys
[2:29:58] <HoIlywood_SN> @Rostichenburg does Shocker play football with Silvermanes head?
[2:30:02] <+SparkAfterDark> these bad guys really suck at killing eachother

[2:30:53] <Warbot40> Fisk Echo
[2:31:06] <mayorrev> launch him off the side like the demo!
[2:31:09] <+Thorn14> Dead
[2:31:12] <AncelDeLambert> DEAD
[2:31:12] <$MightyMaxT> wack
[2:31:14] <+The_Fancy_Fenneq> It took me way too long to realize how useful a lot of the gadgets are
[2:31:20] <dekkitout> countless dead
[2:31:21] <%badchoice5> Kill them all Peter
[2:31:22] <+Thorn14> Gadgets make the game trivial
[2:31:24] <Habblewater> dead
[2:31:24] <AtlasMcCoy> DEAD
[2:31:24] <gyrogogozeppeli> DEAD
[2:31:25] <Nobrev> dont forget the lower floor pat

[2:31:32] <+xXCrustybunsXx> @Rostichenburg he only appears twice
[2:31:32] <AncelDeLambert> does that guy have a magic gun?
[2:31:35] <KnivesEve> oh shut Pat's playing as yellow jacket
[2:31:36] <+CluelessSniper> That guy died for sure
[2:31:38] <+jayfigga> The gadgets are useful endgame
[2:31:39] <+imporia_> he didn't die if it happened off screen
[2:31:43] <HoIlywood_SN> dead
[2:31:49] <%SolitudeOtM> Spiderman has killed like 20 people
[2:31:52] <Kyrill_PSN> one of the 1st things i tried in this was visiting the memorial...got disapppointed. Remember the comic book cover with spidey at ground zero? That would be a nice moment going as spidey after the rebuilt.
[2:31:53] <gyrogogozeppeli> SUPER DEAD
[2:31:54] <+Thorn14> Spiderman operates under the Kazuma Kiryu "doesn't kill anyone"
[2:31:54] <%Kirijuo> Man not even joking Spider-man is much cooler than Batman
[2:31:55] <Habblewater> 21
[2:31:55] <%SolitudeOtM> 21
[2:31:56] <%Everpresent_Overseer> DEAD
[2:31:56] <Kataguro> You think Fisk won't find you?
[2:31:57] <+Thorn14> system
[2:32:00] <+imporia_> he landed on a passing mattress truck
[2:32:06] <Austin0097> The blame is on God, not Spidey if gravity killed him.
[2:32:08] <zal_silverfang> he disintegrated
[2:32:09] <%Rostichenburg> @xXCrustybunsXx Yeah I figured I think I'm getting close to the end
[2:32:10] <HoIlywood_SN> dead as shit
[2:32:12] <$MightyMaxT> that was pretty dope
[2:32:26] <+Rivet95> Whassup folks.
[2:32:27] <Naho_Saenoki> @AngriestPat If you look down towards dudes you knock off of buildings, you'll see that they somehow got webbed up to a nearby wall.
[2:32:27] <+xXCrustybunsXx> Punisher would love that, a gun that runs off negative energy
[2:32:30] <RadiatedImp> He broke everything in his body btw
[2:32:32] <dekkitout> Jesus saves, Spider doesn't
[2:32:32] <Nobrev> when you knock guys off buildings spidey sticks a little web zipper to them and they get zipped onto walls
[2:32:53] <+StrawberryBandit> Jebaited
[2:32:54] <gyrogogozeppeli> AH FUCK
[2:32:56] <mayorrev> lol
[2:32:59] <+Thorn14> the whiplash would still break their neck
[2:32:59] <%badchoice5> That is a FATALITY MOVE
[2:33:00] <%Rostichenburg> Annihilus is gonna be pissed about all this Negative Zone energy
[2:33:01] <Demon_chann> JEBAITED
[2:33:03] <HoIlywood_SN> @Nobrev at the speeds they're going and the distance they're at they'd be hitting solid concrete or steel or reinforced glass walls at highway speeds
[2:33:04] <dekkitout> 0 dead ResidentSleeper
[2:33:04] <Kyrill_PSN> nice lol
[2:33:05] <ImmaCanuck> LUL
[2:33:09] <HoIlywood_SN> he is very dead
[2:33:10] <ape_hawk> well, he's dead from the speed of the impact
[2:33:10] <mayorrev> fisk you ass
[2:33:11] <Endocrom> Why would he know in jail?
[2:33:16] <HoIlywood_SN> he just zipped right into fucking concrete at like 50 mph
[2:33:18] <+StrawberryBandit> Is the combat infinitely better than Arkham? Cause it looks like it
[2:33:22] <%badchoice5> HE STOMPS THEIR HEADS INTO CONCRETE USING WEBS TO HIT HARDER
[2:33:22] <%SaltyDongs> fisk just fucking tell me
[2:33:23] <+oleron_666> hes fine
[2:33:24] <+imporia_> something something gwen stacy

[2:33:28] <cerberuscarmine> ded
[2:33:28] <CrystalDiglett> ITS THE MASK
[2:33:28] <cherubsanonymous> Oh he has a mask now for some reason
[2:33:30] <+SparkAfterDark> The only thing this game desperately needs is to let me izuna drop purse snatchers off the empire state building. It was the best part of Spiderman 2
[2:33:33] <%Kirijuo> DEAD ACTUALLY
[2:33:37] <mayorrev> HMMMMM
[2:33:37] <+Thorn14> That was Li in the Demo

[2:33:48] <+Tokanova> lmao that should have had a massive backblast
[2:33:49] <+levitheshark> Hello, 3E demo
[2:33:51] <SubjectX07x> WHO CAN THIS BE!?
[2:33:52] <%badchoice5> WIZARD BAZOOKA
[2:33:53] <Fujiwara_92> HERO TIME
[2:33:54] <+levitheshark> E3
[2:33:55] <+StrawberryBandit> barcS
[2:33:57] <%ginger__gaming__> JJJ was right
[2:33:57] <+jayfigga> QTE time boiz
[2:33:58] <Austin0097> @StrawberryBandit I think it is, it's a lot more free flowing and has more options in the moment to moment combat than Arkham does.
[2:33:59] <electronicgoat> 3e
[2:34:01] <$Dutchpotato> It’s actually not li tho
[2:34:04] <+Shuckleberry_Finn> empowered with AZERITE
[2:34:05] <ScoldingHotFire> fail the qte
[2:34:06] <cherubsanonymous> Wow they changed literally everything from that E3 trailer
[2:34:06] <sosuke5> JJJ was right
[2:34:08] <%Cinder5by5> F
[2:34:12] <+Thorn14> The problem with this suit is you can't see the eyes open and close
[2:34:12] <+imporia_> I can't believe they removed the puddles on the crane
[2:34:14] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> Ahhhhh shit
[2:34:15] <+Thorn14> there's no eye reactions
[2:34:16] <%badchoice5> Man, the grip on those Spidey boots
[2:34:18] <$Totally_not_toby> those violins!!!!
[2:34:18] <mayorrev> do the thing!!!
[2:34:21] <Nobrev> JJJ WAS RIGHT
[2:34:22] <wired_soul> uh oh
[2:34:23] <Habblewater> Spider Terrorism
[2:34:23] <puppydogcity> it's 9/11 2
[2:34:25] <Kyrill_PSN> this sequence is so cool
[2:34:26] <AlasterAngelo> BOY I SURE WISH WE COULD PLAY THIS COOL SECTION
[2:34:27] <bear_breaker20> thats messed how that knocked him out
[2:34:27] <deathsmions1> want a spiderman story where he webs up someone and they cant reach their insulin injection
[2:34:28] <dekkitout> was that a fucking ben 10 reference? i swear to god-
[2:34:28] <+CluelessSniper> What happens if you fail this?
[2:34:29] <AncelDeLambert> IMPOSSIBLE there is no GLUE strong enough for the necessary friction!
[2:34:31] <+StrawberryBandit> @Austin0097 It looks more fluid too. And the gadgets look way cooler. I just wish it wasn't exclusive LUL
[2:34:33] <+SparkAfterDark> 9/11 times a thousand
[2:34:37] <%Kirijuo> I'll be honest the black suit makes spider man look kinky
[2:34:38] <+xXCrustybunsXx> @cherubsanonymous they did that alot through the game for plot reasons
[2:34:39] <$MightyMaxT> They do a good job of conveying expressions even when the costume doesn't have the expressive eyes
[2:34:46] <+srkAres> MILLIONS DEAD
[2:34:52] <ape_hawk> im pretty sure all that debris is killing people
[2:34:58] <Coystick> HE KILLED MILLIONS...
[2:35:02] <%Rostichenburg> Arkham city had tons of different approaches to combat this is just faster and has way worse stealth challenge rooms
[2:35:03] <dekkitout> so many fools dead
[2:35:06] <%badchoice5> HELICOPTERS DO NOT WORK THAT WAY
[2:35:06] <+imporia_> "I attached the wrecking ball"
[2:35:09] <%ginger__gaming__> He's a Menace!
[2:35:09] <fairore> comic books man
[2:35:12] <sosuke5> Millions in damages
[2:35:16] <Habblewater> Those webs don't last long, what happens to the crane when it dissolves?
[2:35:16] <mayorrev> run on the wall like the demo
[2:35:17] <%SaltyDongs> Property damage through the roof
[2:35:17] <AtlasMcCoy> Death toll in the millions, cost of damages in the billions
[2:35:18] <HipHopAnonymous23> JJ JAMESON WAS RIGHT
[2:35:18] <+xXCrustybunsXx> HES A HELL
[2:35:20] <dekkitout> still no worse than man of steel
[2:35:21] <Austin0097> @StrawberryBandit It's a really great game, and if you even get a PS4 for cheap I would really recommend it.
[2:35:24] <+xXCrustybunsXx> OF A PILOT
[2:35:26] <AliveAleks> THEYRE WATCHING US
[2:35:27] <+Meekest> That is some rubberbanding on that helicopter

[2:35:46] <ABlackWeirdo> THE SPIDER MENACE STRIKES AGAIN!
[2:35:48] <+JenovasPuppet> Pat you're losing them!
[2:35:48] <SubjectX07x> Kinda hard to beat Man of Steel without straight up letting the bad guy NUKE MANHATTAN. LUL
[2:35:50] <+Shuckleberry_Finn> A WEAPON TO SURPASS SPIDER MAN
[2:35:52] <+Ell1ot> i thought Pat was good at swinging
[2:35:53] <+xXCrustybunsXx> MAGIC MISSILE
[2:35:54] <%Rostichenburg> Why isn't the human torch solving this
[2:35:57] <$MightyMaxT> Hate when that happens
[2:35:57] <Endocrom> Maybe Yuri could call the Fantastic 4 Kappa
[2:35:58] <+jayfigga> Bitch why don’t you stop it
[2:36:01] <ape_hawk> he corrupted the rockets
[2:36:03] <+SparkAfterDark> If you can make a magic sword why wouldn't it work on rockets too?
[2:36:04] <%SaltyDongs> booooo
[2:36:05] <sosuke5> Pat is bad at spider-manning...
[2:36:07] <EMP_Ike_Turner> ALL WE HAD TO DO WAS FOLLOW THE DAMN HELICOPTER CJ
[2:36:07] <ape_hawk> made the rockets super evil
[2:36:08] <wired_soul> maybe one day we will catch this helicopter
[2:36:11] <Nobrev> mr negative's gimmick is he can corrupt things
[2:36:11] <Austin0097> @StrawberryBandit The system also has a ton of other great exclusives so I think it's worth it.
[2:36:13] <wired_soul> boom
