[0:07:17] <Shockmaster182> @twistedj3ster Thanks friend! My best friend is quitting with me, I feel like we can do this!
[0:07:20] <+Dova573> who dat?
[0:07:25] <%NopeBadguy> your mom is an immersive sim
[0:07:26] <%Taisuru> Video Game genres are tough cause genre normally refers to the plot, games ignore the plot and go by gameplay

[0:07:38] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt does it go by another name?
[0:07:39] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Isn't Immersive Sim more like say Flight Simulator?
[0:07:40] <@QueequegTheater> Immersive sim? Is that like Second Life
[0:07:50] <Shockmaster182> How do you personally define immersive sim?
[0:07:51] <%Mr_Pylon> are the Dusk boys making fun of you again
[0:07:52] <$Futurecity10> @patstaresat pat im 25 years old and I’ve only heard immersive sim 3 times in my life
[0:07:53] <Minorou> what games are considered immersive sims
[0:07:54] <@MistyMntns> What about second life?
[0:07:54] <%DrTomT18> what classifies an immersive sim?
[0:07:57] <%Saffry_Ruzin> I can't keep up with Genres, people call Souls-Like a Genre, but challenging games existed way before that
[0:07:57] <knight_verse> Hey Pat, Insanity is the new Normal... you should change the difficulty to that. Kappa
[0:08:09] <%KeiganOfAstora> All sims are immersive, it's kind of up to you how immersed you feel you are @PatStaresAt

[0:08:30] <%SaiyanShoto> All games are immersive sims in a sense
[0:08:31] <@QueequegTheater> Character action

[0:08:32] <%KeiganOfAstora> @PatStaresAt What about racing sims?
[0:08:32] <%Taisuru> BORK
[0:08:32] <+OboTolken> Is an "immersive sim" where you put someone in a pool and then sell the stairs out so they drown?

[0:09:03] <%peachy996> How bout the genres are called butt and poo
[0:09:04] <stantheman_97> i dunno immersive sim seems pretty cut and dry as an idea

[0:09:23] <%hrbeck_> this example is on hold
[0:09:23] <%Saffry_Ruzin> Is ME3 an RPG or 3rd Person Shooter? can't it be both?  Genres are dumb and confusing

[0:09:53] <deviljhojho_> only people born after 2000 dont know about immersive sims
[0:09:56] <secret_npc> If it's a sim, the immersive part should be implied
[0:09:56] <%peachy996> if you know whad I mean
[0:09:57] <%KeiganOfAstora> @PatStaresAt Does that make the butt pillow a fart simulator?
[0:10:01] <%hrbeck_> screw sims, we're talking about your ass cushion now

[0:10:15] <%PocketBearIllustrator> Pat is simply triggered by the idea of genres. :P
[0:10:17] <smoothwood07> Awwwe he grunt
[0:10:21] <%NopeBadguy> Microsoft Flight Sim Stream when
[0:10:24] <%KeiganOfAstora> iRacing?
[0:10:26] <Minorou> dark souls is an action-adventure-metroidvania-fighting-horror-fantasy game with tons of other subgenres because it has aspects of it all
[0:10:29] <%deviljhojho_> @tizz86 thank you tiz very cool. Dunno why but still
[0:10:38] <%cvp5127> old
[0:10:39] <%Agami23> monster hunter is a RPG and you guys cant convince me otherwise
[0:10:39] <DianaTheAscian> We need to rebuild genre's again
[0:10:40] <%Saffry_Ruzin> Mach Effect should be the spin off game where you pilot the Normandy
[0:10:42] <Dunmarkh> That's because steam tags are user generated for some godawful reason
[0:10:44] <LethalPlacebo> "character-action game" is an absolutely awful term
[0:10:45] <+polothegreatest> MFS looks good
[0:10:47] <%deviljhojho_> thats right
[0:10:51] <%KeiganOfAstora> jeeeeeeeez
[0:10:51] <%Lefanque> oh you mean like Multi player online battle arena
[0:10:52] <bob900000> monster hunter is a rpg /s
[0:10:52] <%Taisuru> Horror is the only genre applied to video games that is ever accurate, as it refers to the plot structure
[0:10:52] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Really?!? huh
[0:10:52] <@tizz86> @deviljhojho_ your eyeball was missing
[0:10:59] <+Dova573> are persona 5 and pokemon the same genre?
[0:10:59] <%crimsonharvest> even though Ultima Underworld was the same genre without guns
[0:11:03] <@ssjklyco> Metroid Vania
[0:11:05] <%peachy996> JC there's a bomb!
[0:11:06] <marvel877> This feels like a gif/jif type of situation.
[0:11:07] <%derpy_platypus> This another RogueLIKE versus RogueLIGHT?
[0:11:08] <%NopeBadguy> Even though today we would just call it an RPG
[0:11:10] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Man im learning today
[0:11:11] <%SaiyanShoto> Immersive sim is more for PC games from back in day which I never played so that’s why I didn’t hear about it until wayy later

[0:11:27] <%SaiyanShoto> So a first person shooter?
[0:11:28] <%KeiganOfAstora> That's just dumb marketing
[0:11:29] <%Wurmspawn> Zangief wants to give his two sense on this topic!
[0:11:31] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt sim is kinda vague
[0:11:36] <marvel877> Thank you Gief

[0:12:13] <jdwhalen> Ive been trying to figure this out for months, but too afraid to reveal my noobishness to ask. DO the red hats behind pat say, "Get a Skeleton" or what
[0:12:14] <%deviljhojho_> I should probably remember to keep up my sub more often
[0:12:18] <bob900000> NotLikeThis
[0:12:23] <%BallerSwagBro9k> "You've got a gun, I guess"  Should be a game title
[0:12:24] <+Ace_Flibble> In my day MGS was an RPG, Tekken was a Beat 'Em Up, and Tomb Raider was an Adventure game. Us Brits had our own rules.
[0:12:24] <+Dova573> Bioshock?
[0:12:25] <%DrTomT18> the more we know
[0:12:27] <%NopeBadguy> Would you include Metal Gear Solid 3?

[0:12:39] <%Ches_Neckbeard> Gief does not care for video game genre talk
[0:12:41] <%deviljhojho_> Is "The Sims" series immersive sims
[0:12:42] <Minorou> welp, back to " -clone" naming scheme
[0:12:44] <%peachy996> Sorry Pat but I think Zangief is right
[0:12:44] <%crimsonharvest> violence is the only way to win in bioshock so no

[0:14:12] <+ThomasOfTroy> MGS is exactly what it's title says, a tactical espionage action game
[0:14:15] <$StrawberryPantsu> SI-FI WHORE?
[0:14:21] <+polothegreatest> MGS3 is a movie with some gameplay LUL
[0:14:32] <marvel877> What matters is "what's at the core of the game"
[0:14:38] <%Saffry_Ruzin> But is Tactical Espionage a Genre?
[0:14:39] <cpt_langosta> i will from now on
[0:14:40] <mrtanaka111> thats a minimalist aproach to fiction
[0:14:44] <+Mrbaconator> pat can you just make a "rats can't swim" but for game genres
[0:14:47] <@MistyMntns> @polothegreatest Nah You are thinking of MGS4
[0:14:49] <+ThomasOfTroy> @polothegreatest That's not how you spell MGS4

[0:15:09] <$StrawberryPantsu> Survival Horror

[0:16:30] <%AmericanSkidd> More than one or two...
[0:16:31] <%Ynkubus_> 5?
[0:16:31] <%deviljhojho_> metal gear rising revengeance?
[0:16:32] <$StrawberryPantsu> Alot
[0:16:33] <+Ace_Flibble> "third person shooter" GTFO
[0:16:34] <ScreamLord> Dead Space
[0:16:37] <%deviljhojho_> i guess its sci fi and action
[0:16:37] <%Wurmspawn> nearly EVERY sci-fi game?
[0:16:37] <jbrachob> BRING BACK THE DOGGO
[0:16:42] <Latija> sci-fi is very broad
[0:16:42] <SummonerMagno> dog snorts are better than this topic
[0:16:44] <%Agami23> what genre is devil may cry?
[0:16:44] <%chill_o_wisp> space? ayup that's a scifi
[0:16:45] <%rumtumtugnutz> Body horror. Like Cronenberg films.
[0:16:45] <marvel877> 24.
[0:16:50] <%afronooch> wouldn't like 99% of games be character action
[0:16:53] <marvel877> 24 is the highest number.
[0:16:54] <%baka_sugoi> A N I M E GAME
[0:16:57] <%fitzsquilliam> tactical third person story
[0:16:57] <%Theycallmenerf> Turn Based Strategy
[0:17:01] <DeepPix3l> Some people call XCOM scifi action
[0:17:02] <PanicSwytch> Tactical Espionage Action
[0:17:05] <Shockmaster182> Yo are we curing the genophage today or is that gonna be Friday probably?
[0:17:05] <%crimsonharvest> yeah because you have to, video games dont do anything until you use them.
[0:17:07] <%Saffry_Ruzin> Watchdogs Legion is probably Sci-Fi
[0:17:10] <%deviljhojho_> tactical third person action horror game with rpg elements. also a roguelike
[0:17:13] <%castlerock42> Hell, I was thinking more RPG than any other kind.
[0:17:18] <%hrbeck_> is it 4x or rts?
[0:17:18] <$ainzhelm> Does it come out if Japan? I guess it’s a JRPG
[0:17:18] <MiamiMemory> @PatStaresAt  You could write a book on this topic, assuming it doesn't exist already - dissecting different genres.
[0:17:22] <teefpal> Yep
[0:17:26] <%HaroldDonchee> Isaac got stronger
[0:17:27] <%DrTomT18> he right
[0:17:28] <cpt_langosta> and dead space 3 is a piece of shit
[0:17:28] <williamrooster> psaDogchamp > psaWhat
[0:17:31] <%Ches_Neckbeard> was Pat fighting with someone on twitter about video game genres?
[0:17:34] <@ssjklyco> And  RE 6 is  a garbage game
[0:17:34] <%4DLuvOfLuthy> no, shhh
[0:17:38] <$StrawberryPantsu> @PatStaresAt Dead Space 2 is more action focused
[0:17:40] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt btw Twitter is doing that thing where its nigh unusable if you're not signed in so a bunch of people cant see your stream schedule or announcements lol
[0:17:43] <HarshNerf> !game
[0:17:45] <+ThomasOfTroy> Mass effect is an sci-fi FPS romance sim from the camera's perspective
[0:17:46] <%Saffry_Ruzin> Isaac channeled Ripley as his Stand
[0:17:47] <%maenos2> persition
[0:17:48] <anAngryHamster> And Dead Space 3 is a shitty game
[0:17:51] <+BeardedLuchador> JRPG used to piss me off when I wanted a FF7 but got a Tactics type game
[0:17:53] <%Wurmspawn> What about RE1,2,&3 vs RE4,5,&6?
[0:17:54] <%DrTomT18> Well, I guess 2 can become a SURVIVAL horror if you play it on the highest difficulty
[0:17:59] <+FingaLights> Die Hard is a Christmas movie
[0:18:00] <%toolofparanoia> ho ho ho
[0:18:01] <teefpal> Good point
[0:18:02] <%fitzsquilliam> online roguelike game in a persistent world  with tactical third person cover based looter shooting
[0:18:07] <Tracazoid> Nier: "how many games can I stuff in here."
[0:18:10] <%deviljhojho_> Die hard is a stealth movie
[0:18:12] <$StrawberryPantsu> It is
[0:18:13] <%deviljhojho_> or is it?
[0:18:13] <marvel877> I thought Dead Space 1 was just RE4 in space and Dead Space 2 was RE5 in space?
[0:18:14] <$ainzhelm> Well Issac is a cool guy in 2
[0:18:20] <cpt_langosta> die hard: christmas stealth shooter
[0:18:23] <%machshop> stealth christmas movie
[0:18:24] <tronhd> oh God not this again
[0:18:24] <Latija> christmas movies are movies that take place on christmas
[0:18:24] <%baka_sugoi> LUL
[0:18:24] <+ThomasOfTroy> And it's the best god damn christmas movie there is
[0:18:24] <%fitzsquilliam> die hard is a metal gear movie
[0:18:24] <%Ynkubus_> no
[0:18:24] <%AmericanSkidd> yes
[0:18:25] <MiamiMemory> Die Hard is a comedy
[0:18:26] <%Treuan> That's a really good example
[0:18:26] <%crimsonharvest> Yeah die hard doesnt have any interactivity so we dont have a place for that metadata
[0:18:28] <%The_Protagonist> Christmas Stealth
[0:18:28] <%Torus1025> Yakuza is a Christmas Game
[0:18:30] <%HaroldDonchee> die hard is a foreign film
[0:18:32] <+dd44dostivei> ho ho ho
[0:18:33] <%Agami23> this just feels more like movies suck at having good genres
[0:18:33] <%bevyrage> it's not just die hard, it's most die hard movies have 3 things in them: stealth, helicopters, and christmas
[0:18:36] <%Meekest> Die Hard is an immersive simulator
[0:18:37] <%deviljhojho_> stealth action movie with christmas elements
[0:18:38] <teefpal> @fitzsquilliam VoteYea
[0:18:38] <Nightwolf656> Not if your talking Die Hard 1
[0:18:39] <%Saffry_Ruzin> Dead Space 3 is a Lost Planet game but with big spooky
[0:18:41] <%hrbeck_> "it's in christmas, now it's a christmas movie"
[0:18:42] <%DrTomT18> well shit
[0:18:42] <%machshop> LUL
[0:18:42] <MiamiMemory> Die Hard is family-friendly
[0:18:43] <%Wurmspawn> By that logic, Gremlins is a Christmas movie.
[0:18:44] <%Monkeyweed21> 3RD PERSON STEALTH CHRISTMAS
[0:18:45] <%hatok> Die Hard is an Action Adventure movie with RPG elements
[0:18:45] <+Ace_Flibble> is Blade a character action movie?
[0:18:46] <bob900000> what death stranding
[0:18:46] <%Bt_Robot> Die Hard is Tactical Espionage Action
[0:18:46] <%Taisuru> That's Matt's doing
[0:18:47] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Or Pathfinders
[0:18:49] <%toolofparanoia> i like it
[0:18:49] <%The_Protagonist> Searchction
[0:18:49] <Daxalog> seach action is what theyre called over in japan
[0:18:49] <zhenthrim213> wat
[0:18:51] <%epide> DIE HARD IS A MOVIEthats the odd part
[0:18:51] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt certain Gundams are Christmas shows
[0:18:52] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Wait if Die Hard is a Christmas movie then Iron Man 3 is a Christmas movie
[0:18:53] <+FingaLights> Sounds gross though
[0:18:54] <+polothegreatest> boo
[0:18:57] <%rumtumtugnutz> Die Hard is a Christmas Action Comedy
[0:18:57] <@ssjklyco> But QuakenDooms though
[0:18:57] <%SovPho> hide and shoot fuck yourself
[0:18:58] <teefpal> Thanks Matt
[0:18:58] <%DrTomT18> @Saffry_Ruzin There isn't much spooky in Dead Space  3
[0:19:00] <secret_npc> Metroidvania should just stay the way it is
[0:19:01] <%maenos2> I hate the term character action
[0:19:02] <+Davion_Salkovich> so what's your problem
[0:19:03] <DeepPix3l> Exploration Action seems more appropriate
[0:19:04] <%toolofparanoia> search action has a good ring to it
[0:19:07] <+elah2012> eh maybe exploration action?
[0:19:08] <@MistyMntns> All Genres are Made up and Nothing Matters!
[0:19:09] <xanerts> thats the official term by nintendo
[0:19:10] <Shockmaster182> psaCrazyhead
[0:19:11] <%JoshManVGH> You look for actions even
[0:19:12] <%Monkeyweed21> @bob900000 unironic Walking Sim
[0:19:14] <%The_Protagonist> Walkystabbo
[0:19:15] <%hrbeck_> Quaken Doom Shlooters
[0:19:25] <%DrTomT18> I've never understood what character action IS
[0:19:25] <%machshop> but isn't assassins creed a game where you search for stuff and also have action stuff
[0:19:25] <%maenos2> It's generic to me.
[0:19:27] <$ainzhelm> Euro Jank is a genre
[0:19:29] <secret_npc> What does he think it means?
[0:19:30] <%maenos2> yup
[0:19:31] <+polothegreatest> ew, a SAG game
[0:19:32] <Thrashcrow> Isn't that a long running Giant Bomb bit, that Jeff Gerstmann hates the term Metroidvania?
[0:19:33] <%Agami23> i like stylish action over character action
[0:19:33] <%peachy996> Batman Returns is a Christmas Movie
[0:19:34] <yeildingthought> One of the few good things to come from twitter Kappa
[0:19:43] <%Saffry_Ruzin> There's Spooky if you're lucky enough to have a friend and they make you play as Veg- I mean Carver
[0:19:44] <%rumtumtugnutz> @BallerSwagBro9k No it isn't. Die Hard takes place entirely on Christmas. Iron Man 3 takes place over several days.
[0:19:48] <%chill_o_wisp> it's about BUILDING your character
[0:19:53] <%crimsonharvest> theyre almost always just brawlers like why do we even have deeper specificity
[0:19:57] <PanicSwytch> yes
[0:19:58] <%Ancopro> action adventure omg
[0:19:58] <$StrawberryPantsu> action adventure
[0:19:59] <%maenos2> true
[0:19:59] <bob900000> yup
[0:19:59] <cpt_langosta> god of war isn't character action because kratos has no character
[0:20:03] <+ThomasOfTroy> No, I do not remember when you were a child
[0:20:04] <%baka_sugoi> yeah
[0:20:04] <IwishIwasTaylorSwift> i love action
[0:20:05] <@ssjklyco> God of War is character action (2018 )
[0:20:06] <%HaroldDonchee> stardew valley is an action adventure game
[0:20:08] <TheFramedWarlock> It still is
[0:20:09] <$StrawberryPantsu> MGS IS AN ACTION ADVENTURE GAME
[0:20:09] <%Mr_Pylon> Tomb Raider action adventure, Deus Ex action adventure
[0:20:12] <jbrachob> oh yeah, every game in the early 90s was an action adventure game
[0:20:13] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> Can we just get rid of the "action" genre
[0:20:13] <blackjack8182> Hello Pat!
[0:20:14] <PanicSwytch> Action/Adventure
[0:20:14] <+ThomasOfTroy> LUL

[0:20:17] <+FingaLights> Zelda is a RPG is my fav
[0:20:18] <anAngryHamster> Character action is like MOBA, too broad to
[0:20:18] <%DrTomT18> sorry, forth g ame
[0:20:18] <teefpal> Shadow of the Colossus and God of War were both "action adventure"
[0:20:19] <%KeiganOfAstora> Still talking about genres lol
[0:20:23] <%Agami23> most of us werent alive in your childhood
[0:20:24] <%chill_o_wisp> you still are a child
[0:20:25] <%Dopamien> I don't believe you
[0:20:25] <@tizz86> WAS??
[0:20:26] <%Saffry_Ruzin> People besides myself age
[0:20:29] <%Mr_Pylon> sports games are real-time strategy action games
[0:20:29] <%Wurmspawn> Action is video genres was the same as the letter X is 90's cartoons.
[0:20:30] <%Torus1025> Action adventure makes sense in relation to like pacman
[0:20:31] <+elah2012> I thought pat came out the womb like this
[0:20:32] <%DrTomT18> it is an action game
[0:20:32] <mr_saturday93> you still are pat lol
[0:20:34] <%Puhff> was Kappa
[0:20:34] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> pfft

[0:20:37] <%Monkeyweed21> @ssjklyco god of war 2018 is an action rpg
[0:20:38] <DeepPix3l> Button Bashers is my favorite Genre
[0:20:40] <+pmtriox> but is it an RPG anymore? is it really?
[0:20:40] <IwishIwasTaylorSwift> remove all actions from games
[0:20:42] <Captain_Joe1911> boo
[0:20:45] <$StrawberryPantsu> Tales of Arise is an Action game
[0:20:48] <%maenos2> fair point pat btw.  still not a huge fan but I can accept that.
[0:20:48] <OldManDeckardCain> eh, I wouldn't go as far as calling mass effect 3 an rpg of any kind
[0:20:49] <%Saffry_Ruzin> Is Minecraft an action game?
[0:20:51] <@MistyMntns> Mass Effect is an Isekai
[0:20:53] <Shockmaster182> Man look at grandpa over here
[0:20:53] <+D00msDayDan> video games were objectively a mistake

[0:23:00] <%hrbeck_> how do you roleplay Link? with speech!?
[0:23:00] <%Wurmspawn> Playing the ROLE of a character in a game DOES NOT MAKE IT A ROLE PLAYING GAME.
[0:23:01] <%Ziegsy> What genre is gief?
[0:23:05] <%SaiyanShoto> Genres always confused me
[0:23:07] <%chill_o_wisp> I would consider botw the closest one to RPG, but yeah zelda in general is NOT an RPG
[0:23:08] <IwishIwasTaylorSwift> just dont use action in genre name
[0:23:11] <%Wurmspawn> You do that in nearly EVERY SINGLE GAME.

[0:23:28] <secret_npc> We all know what the genres mean, nobody is getting confused for them, this is just a categorisation issue
[0:23:28] <$ainzhelm> Left 4 dead is a christmas game because I got it on Christmas and Francis says Merry Christmas in the opening cutscene

[0:23:59] <%Wurmspawn> Zangeif is SO fed up with this conversation.
[0:24:00] <teefpal> Because Metroid and Castlevania were the only series to use that gameplay
[0:24:02] <DianaTheAscian> but what do you say to the people that never played Zelda?

[0:24:34] <MiamiMemory> @Saffry_Ruzin  It's hard to define FO4 as an RPF even, considering that all of the dialogue choices don't matter.

[0:24:42] <+kullumanati> Just like the cube
[0:24:44] <Nightwolf656> This is why RPG's are fucked, in terms of genres because literally every game you play that has a protagonist in it you can just go "O i'm playing an RPG cause i'm role-playing"
[0:24:44] <%Saffry_Ruzin> What if Zelda was actually the Princess of High Rule the whole time?

[0:27:57] <MiamiMemory> @PatStaresAt   Strand-type games?
[0:27:58] <T_Sasquatch> i found cowboy bebop so fucking boring
[0:27:58] <%SaiyanShoto> Isn’t it a space western?
[0:28:02] <TheAntiNihilist> no its not
[0:28:02] <%logoth_> MOBA
[0:28:03] <$StrawberryPantsu> YEYEYEYEY
[0:28:03] <%HaroldDonchee> I kinda wish there was more bounty hunting in bebop
[0:28:04] <%Wurmspawn> David Cage games are in the EMOTION genre.
[0:28:06] <teefpal> TACTICAL STEALTH ACTION
[0:28:07] <$StrawberryPantsu> I love that game
[0:28:07] <%Ziegsy> HIGH OCTANE
[0:28:07] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> HIGH SPEED ROBOT ACTION RULES

[0:28:12] <%Treuan> We need more HSRA Games
[0:28:12] <RayCSmooth> I approve
[0:28:13] <%rumtumtugnutz> I don't think Space Western aptly describes Cowboy Bebop. Trigun is is a Space Westers. Cowboy Bebop is NoirPunk.
[0:28:15] <zhenthrim213> your damn right it is
[0:28:16] <Consumanist> HSRA
[0:28:16] <%twistedj3ster> I want 3 so badly
[0:28:17] <%baka_sugoi> METAL GEAR
[0:28:17] <%deviljhojho_> as opposed to slow speed robot action like pacific rim
[0:28:17] <%Lefanque> I mean it works
[0:28:17] <%Ghufufin> fuck yea it is
[0:28:21] <bob900000> Is KOJIMA a genre

[0:28:25] <%RealThiele> GENIUS KOJUMBO
[0:28:28] <DSD24> Tactical Stealth Operations with Peace Walker
[0:28:29] <%mike2hands> I always wanted to play SOTE
[0:28:31] <%KeiganOfAstora> @PatStaresAt What genre is Zone Of The Enders?
[0:28:32] <$ainzhelm> The best bullshit genre is “The Dark Souls of *blank”
[0:28:32] <+curse85> yakuza = action soapopera
[0:28:34] <DeepPix3l> "Minecraft with _____" Genre
[0:28:34] <%SaiyanShoto> What about hentai games?
[0:28:35] <illtima> You're still on about that?!!
[0:28:36] <%Ravioli_Ronin> Titanfall 2 is high speed Bro-bot action Kappa
[0:28:38] <TheAntiNihilist> cowboy bebop is just slice of life.
[0:28:41] <+Ace_Flibble> Could a western developer make a JRPG in the way Avatar & Korra are often called anime? Or would they never 'earn' the J?
[0:28:43] <@ssjklyco> A David Cage
[0:28:44] <KaiserMario> Like what?
[0:28:45] <%KeiganOfAstora> @PatStaresAt Is Death Stranding a Walking Simulator? LUL
[0:28:46] <%deviljhojho_> a game by (not) hideo kojima
[0:28:47] <secret_npc> LESSON: genre isn't actually confusing
[0:28:48] <teefpal> They tried that with Metal Gear Survive
[0:28:48] <%cvp5127> what about people embarrassed by the genres of their games
[0:28:49] <%rumtumtugnutz> Soulslike is the most bullshit genre
[0:28:49] <%mike2hands> just put nanomachine
[0:28:49] <+Dova573> is Splinter cell a tactical espionage game?
[0:28:51] <stantheman_97> like lynchian or lovecraftian
[0:28:55] <TheSaltminer> is "Ball Bustingly Hard But Fair" a style?
[0:28:55] <TheAntiNihilist> that is a FACT
[0:28:56] <%Ziegsy> Crash bandicoot is the dark souls of platformers
[0:28:57] <secret_npc> No
[0:29:01] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt what would you say is the Kojima style?
[0:29:01] <MiamiMemory> "This game really makes you FEEL like Batman."
[0:29:02] <+FingaLights> Ye, it's more style now
[0:29:02] <%toolofparanoia> Konami sure can't psaSmug
[0:29:05] <%peachy996> Cowboy Bebop is a mishmash of everything
[0:29:08] <$StrawberryPantsu> Those south park games are JRPGs
[0:29:10] <blackjack8182> According to Yu Suzuki, Shenmue belongs to genre he termed “full reactive eyes entertainment” or “FREE”
[0:29:10] <%SovPho> American developers make JRPGs all the time. Not to mention, JRPGs are basically just a derivative of early Western RPGs.
[0:29:12] <+aBlueWizard> aBlueWizard subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 15 months! Hope to see more BigMclargehuge on the team this stream.
[0:29:13] <+wellyLive> Hey MATT!
[0:29:14] <teefpal> They can absolutely make a JRPG
[0:29:17] <%SaiyanShoto> But will it be good?
[0:29:18] <%Monkeyweed21> the end message of MGS5 is that anyone can make a Kojima game as long as they have enough brain damage
[0:29:19] <%mike2hands> it could be anime style
[0:29:19] <PanicSwytch> I work at a gamestore and it is so difficult discribing genres to customers that don't know all the genre
[0:29:21] <%Agami23> undertale is a JRPG
[0:29:25] <%Bt_Robot> What genre is Kingdom Hearts?
[0:29:26] <%DrTomT18> Tactical Turn Based and J-RPG are VERY different forms of gameplay!
[0:29:27] <%rumtumtugnutz> The American Final Fantasy game is considered a JRPG.
[0:29:28] <Tracazoid> South Park The Stick of Truth is just Paper Mario/Mario RPG
[0:29:30] <Profmcstevie> Capcom made a WRPG in Dogma
[0:29:32] <%Wurmspawn> There's a genre of "games" that are DEVOTED to making JRPGs.
[0:29:33] <teefpal> There are SO MANY indie JRPGS out there
[0:29:34] <secret_npc> No, it has to be from Japan
[0:29:36] <%hatok> you could make a JRPG but you'd have to get over the western problem of trying to "fix" JRPGs
[0:29:36] <%SovPho> @PatStaresAt there's a GameMakersToolkit episode about this.
[0:29:37] <xanerts> Is dark souls a jrpg?
[0:29:39] <+polothegreatest> "Batman games are like pizzas"
[0:29:43] <%JoshManVGH> Cheer500 A friends boyfriend once seriously told me that they loved RPGs, like Devil May Cry, because it playes like Zelda. And they where an avid video game fan.
[0:29:44] <bob900000> ooof
[0:29:44] <%RealThiele> rpg maker

[0:29:48] <%BoxNavy> button bashers

[0:30:02] <TheAntiNihilist> its about the Japanese MIND that does it
[0:30:02] <%KeiganOfAstora> lol
[0:30:18] <%SaiyanShoto> From what I’ve seen when people try to differentiate jrpgs and rpgs they say one has certain tropes and the other has different tropes
[0:30:20] <%RealThiele> BLITZ
[0:30:20] <teefpal> cant forget RPG Maker games
[0:30:30] <%KeiganOfAstora> NEITHER
[0:30:33] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt anime fighter is also different from Japaneses fighter

[0:30:34] <%Bt_Robot> Souls-Like
[0:30:35] <%chill_o_wisp> the soulsborne
[0:30:36] <%AmericanSkidd> Dark Souls is a Bandicoot like
[0:30:37] <%fitzsquilliam> souls and diablo are arpgs and which means they are exactly the same
[0:30:37] <%ahomeschooldropout> what is assassin's creed at this point
[0:30:40] <%deviljhojho_> becoming your own genre is a king move
[0:30:41] <%SaiyanShoto> Old Killer Instinct was good too
[0:30:45] <%toolofparanoia> Souls-likes
[0:30:46] <TheAntiNihilist> Mortal Kombat was always good
[0:30:47] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> Cryptic Search Action

[0:32:57] <+ThomasOfTroy> Alive yes, aware no
[0:32:57] <%count_bob> I remember golden eye.
[0:32:57] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> I was alive, but like 4 lol

[0:33:05] <+FingaLights> I thought it sucked
[0:33:07] <@ssjklyco> Goldeneye has dual analog control
[0:33:07] <%toolofparanoia> GOLDEN EYE IS THE SHIT. BEST GAME BEST MOVIE
[0:33:08] <%Rikufmix21> wrpgs and persona 5 likes Kappa
[0:33:08] <%Wurmspawn> What bugs me is when people get upset that Resident Evil isn't scary to them eventhough they are categorized "Survival/Horror" forgetting the fact that part of what makes the game tense is just surviving. It's not meant to be SUPER scary. Just tense.
[0:33:09] <+vaderxyz1970> Pencil for life

[0:34:15] <%Agami23> walking simulators are just adventure games!
[0:34:16] <%AmericanSkidd> All RPG's are just Adventure clones
[0:34:19] <Gorshum> The Souls genre title will get longer with every series Miyazaki creates.
[0:34:19] <mrtanaka111> is simulator a genre or a estatement?

[0:34:22] <%KeiganOfAstora> Just went to twitter. Wow

[0:34:25] <%hrbeck_> "why do we have to talk about stuff and use our human mouths to understand the world?"

[0:34:29] <+FingaLights> @PeachSaliva God bless you
[0:34:30] <%Monkeyweed21> theres only one REAL walking sim and its Death Stranding
[0:34:30] <+Ace_Flibble> "walking simulator" only applies to QWOP.
[0:34:31] <smoothwood07> I’m hear for the whooole lecture!
[0:34:32] <%RealThiele> Paige only knows how to kill

[0:34:35] <+Slydc> wouldnt death stranding be a walking simulator?
[0:34:36] <%Treasure_Vault> On one hand, I've heard of Immersive Sims way back. On the other hand, it was from some other dude playing Prey.
[0:34:36] <+D00msDayDan> death stranding isn't a walking simulator, it's a hiking simulator
[0:34:37] <rambling_madman> What genre are those games that say "YOULL CUM IN 10 SECONDS"
[0:34:38] <%SveriSageAdvice> @PeachSaliva the absolute balls someone has to tweet at you for something so dumb lmao

[0:34:59] <%aBlueWizard> boy do they
[0:34:59] <MiamiMemory> Firewatch
[0:35:01] <DSD24> Gone Home was not great
[0:35:03] <+Sendrak70> How do you feel about Hidden Object Games? Also known as HOGs. Do you enjoy a big fat HOG?
[0:35:06] <RayCSmooth> I can walk in real life, where's my double jump Kappa
[0:35:06] <Astrophizz> What Remains of Edith Finch is great
[0:35:06] <%Puhff> but Edith Finch is cool af
[0:35:06] <Consumanist> walking can be fun if done right
[0:35:06] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Yup
[0:35:06] <%Bt_Robot> if you know the code
[0:35:08] <TheAntiNihilist> @agami23 A LOT of walking simulators have NO adventure to them at all
[0:35:09] <Nightwolf656> Death stranding isn't the only walking sim guys...It's just the most expensive ever made.
[0:35:10] <%SveriSageAdvice> @PeachSaliva especially when Pat JUST MENTIONED that you werent feeling so great
[0:35:10] <kingra> They are terrible walking simulators and THE WORST
[0:35:10] <OldManDeckardCain> death stranding is an immersive boredom simulator
[0:35:10] <T_Sasquatch> Just make a fucking movie
[0:35:11] <28moogles> Gone Home is good, people just got weird about it.
[0:35:11] <artoflec> yeah they're just bad games, you cna make cool narrative first person things
[0:35:12] <rambling_madman> Meat Beating Sims
[0:35:14] <teebos> Outer wilds?
[0:35:15] <%RealThiele> Hentai jerkoff games are under the classy section
[0:35:18] <blackjack8182> Gone home sucked
[0:35:18] <nyacoo> is Death Stranding a walking simulator?
[0:35:18] <+curse85> i was watching the lawn mower simulator no joke for like 2 hours the other day lmao
[0:35:19] <kingra> *the first
[0:35:20] <%YakumoYomi> Everybody's Gone to the Rapture is the only one I've played, and it was a waste of my time
[0:35:20] <%peachy996> @PeachSaliva Convince Pat to cancel the videogame for Chat with Pat
[0:35:21] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> was Firewatch good, it looked interesting
[0:35:21] <ShinyDemonGuy> no gameplay, just walk'n'talk/read
[0:35:22] <+FingaLights> Gone Home was fine for the time. It's fine
[0:35:26] <%Agami23> you know what is the absolute weirdest game to define? dreams
[0:35:26] <%hrbeck_> imagine if Doom fucking sucked?
[0:35:28] <%count_bob> Is Myst a walking simulator?
[0:35:30] <%doc_ock_rokc> Gone home sucked balls the writing was terrible
[0:35:33] <+polothegreatest> slenderman games
[0:35:34] <Finaldragoon> Stanley Parable best walking sim
[0:35:35] <%Monkeyweed21> Vanishing of Ethan Carter is legit good cuz it has GAMEPLAY
[0:35:35] <Consumanist> "Go Home You're Drunk"
[0:35:36] <%Ravioli_Ronin> Haven’t people forgot about both of those by now?
[0:35:36] <%ahomeschooldropout> Is Disco Elysium a top-down walking sim
[0:35:36] <%DrTomT18> @nyacoo yes and no. It has combat.
[0:35:39] <%RealThiele> firewatch was cool buts its dev is a shit
[0:35:41] <TheAntiNihilist> gone home is AMAZINGLY great
[0:35:42] <PanicSwytch> Death strandingnis ups the game
[0:35:43] <T_Sasquatch> also walking simulators feel so pretentious
[0:35:45] <anAngryHamster> I figured out Gone Home's story within 15 seconds of opening the door
[0:35:45] <+Dova573> a bad WS is just the part of fallout/elder scroll games were you searc a room an read the books/notes in a room
[0:35:46] <@MistyMntns> @count_bob Yes. And it is my favorite movie.
[0:35:49] <LethalPlacebo> I liked Gone Home, but if you didn't like it, I might suggest the follow-up game Tacoma. It has a lot more going on with it
[0:35:50] <+jojo_abob> whats that?
[0:35:50] <%Meekest> Ze bad game
[0:35:51] <+Ace_Flibble> Gone Home's story's good but there's *zero* point playing it. It could have been a podcast drama.
[0:35:51] <%Ipsenscastle> I was gonna say that yeah
[0:35:53] <+FingaLights> @count_bob Think it has point n click and puzzle stuff?
[0:35:53] <@MistyMntns> @count_bob Favorite game jesus
[0:35:54] <MiamiMemory> @rambling_madman  Huniepop is meat beating sim, that makes you think
[0:35:55] <%crimsonharvest> Normal films are walking simulators
[0:35:56] <DSD24> I barely remember Rapture
[0:35:59] <+curse85> myst is puzzle byt yeah kinda still lol
[0:36:00] <+D00msDayDan> oh man fuck that one
[0:36:02] <Gorshum> At least it's not desert bus.
[0:36:05] <%castlerock42> God, I forgot about that game.
[0:36:06] <TheAntiNihilist> that was shit
[0:36:06] <blackjack8182> Everyones gone to the rapture was a waste of time
[0:36:08] <secret_npc> Gone Home was fine cause there's alternative fun in picking shit up
[0:36:09] <Virokwet> i liked gone home when it first came out. cant judge it now
[0:36:10] <%valriot> When its JUST LOOKING, its boring as fuck. Id like Alan Wake if it was only talking
[0:36:11] <%cvp5127> they're just visual novels with walking
[0:36:11] <%Agami23> what genre is sonic dreams collection? walking simulator?
[0:36:13] <%toolofparanoia> Night in the Woods is a walking sim right?
[0:36:13] <jbrachob> the standly parable is an AMAZING walking sim
[0:36:14] <%GalacticaPhanto> whatever that genre where you watched live action footage and solved the murder was pretty ok
[0:36:15] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt Vanishing of Ethan Carter has actual gameplay
[0:36:15] <@MistyMntns> And Myst is getting a remake right now.
[0:36:16] <teefpal> Best walking sim I've played is What Remains of Edith Finch
[0:36:18] <%Puhff> and flat
[0:36:19] <PaperyHornet1013> were whalers on the moon
[0:36:29] <%BoxNavy> :)
[0:36:34] <%AmericanSkidd> Trials in Tainted Space is my favorite space rpg Kappa
[0:36:36] <MiamiMemory> @PatStaresAt  Thoughts on Night Trap?
[0:36:37] <secret_npc> Gone Home is an immersive sim
[0:36:39] <+Slydc> would movies be considered walking simulators?
[0:36:41] <T_Sasquatch> Adios may as well be cinematic tbh
[0:36:43] <%JoshManVGH> Tim Rogers classified Death Stranding as the "Microsoft Flight Simulator of Walking Simulators" and I think that's a pretty damn good genre.
[0:36:47] <%DrTomT18> @AmericanSkidd GET OUT
[0:36:49] <%Ghufufin> isnt more of a choose your own adventure?
[0:36:49] <+FingaLights> And actually talk to someone
[0:36:51] <+curse85> fuck myst its all about 7th Guest
[0:36:51] <%RealThiele> that phone call with the one guy was a boss fight
[0:36:52] <%peachy996> Sonic Dreams is a blend of Dating Sim, Pokemon Snap-like and Adventure game
[0:36:54] <28moogles> People calling these narrative games "walking simulators" pisses me off because Death Stranding should have invented that term.
[0:36:54] <%SaphronBlackbourne> Adios was okay to me I don't get the hype
[0:36:56] <+FingaLights> Actua story
[0:37:00] <%crimsonharvest> Indigo Prophecy is a superior walking simulator
[0:37:06] <%Ipsenscastle> Obra Dinn is the perfect walking sim
[0:37:07] <MAX116030> @PatStaresAt Totalbiscuit had a name for Walking games, something lie "Virtual installment" he wont call them games since its just very little interactions
[0:37:12] <%KeiganOfAstora> lol
[0:37:15] <%deviljhojho_> A Life Like
[0:37:15] <secret_npc> That's why Metroidvania still works
[0:37:16] <Latija> it's the dark souls of ...
[0:37:19] <%peachy996> Indigo Prophecy is a Simon Says Simulator
[0:37:20] <%DrTomT18> @crimsonharvest Indigo Prophecy is a nightmare
[0:37:21] <+ThomasOfTroy> "The Darks Souls of X" though
[0:37:21] <+D00msDayDan> the dark souls of video game comparisons
[0:37:23] <%Alig200> or you could fall into Kojima's bullshit and somehow maintain that Death Stranding is a "strand" game.
[0:37:24] <%JoshManVGH> It gets the point across
[0:37:24] <%fitzsquilliam> i wish i could hit someone with my carry-on in flight sim
[0:37:25] <tcosmiclatte> Is :Night in the woods" considered a walking sim?
[0:37:28] <%RealThiele> Delivery Man: Aemrica EX Edition
[0:37:29] <%aBlueWizard> I hate that
[0:37:29] <Blank9> this is the Surge 1 of Dark Souls of rpgs
[0:37:33] <%Wurmspawn> @PatStaresAt If YOUR life was a game, what Genre would it be?
[0:37:33] <%JoshManVGH> LUL
[0:37:34] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Papers Please is a Sim game
[0:37:37] <%Monkeyweed21> OOF
[0:37:41] <28moogles> the Dark Souls of Persona
[0:37:43] <Minorou> dark souls is the dark souls of game comparisons
[0:37:49] <legion0047> Overlord is a tower defense game
[0:37:50] <+FingaLights> It works. And people hate it
[0:37:50] <secret_npc> Folks complain, but we all understand
[0:37:52] <%Rikufmix21> "getting major persona vibes from this"
[0:37:52] <%cvp5127> nintendo hates it LUL
[0:37:52] <%deviljhojho_> they HATE I
[0:37:54] <krabthecrab> People hate it?
[0:37:57] <%Agami23> the game "lock" on dreams is pretty much a 10/10 myst-type
[0:38:01] <teefpal> Sure, no other reason...
[0:38:02] <T_Sasquatch> metroidvania is so annoying
[0:38:03] <Nightwolf656> Metroidvania may be the best video game descriptor ever
[0:38:07] <%trackles_64> its an immersive sim pat
[0:38:08] <legion0047> It just hits the bullseye
[0:38:09] <+ThomasOfTroy> People hate it? I've honestly never heard anything bad about it
[0:38:10] <OldManDeckardCain> what genre is the new shining force game gonna be tho Kappa
[0:38:10] <@ssjklyco> Darks Souls is a 3D version of Metroid Vania
[0:38:12] <%RealThiele> i dont love that konami still gets credit in their current state
[0:38:13] <+WizoSavage> Should I even play OG Death Stranding when the Director's Cut is about to come out? @PatStaresAt
[0:38:13] <Ardailec> And a map
[0:38:13] <%ahomeschooldropout> @PatStaresAt I would consider Control a Metroidvania
[0:38:15] <Captain_Joe1911> notekWalk
[0:38:16] <%deviljhojho_> the duality of man
[0:38:17] <+dd44dostivei> it really confuses people new to old castlevanias
[0:38:18] <TheAntiNihilist> I don't
[0:38:20] <%Agami23> and then that boss gives you a power up
[0:38:22] <%Ipsenscastle> saying Metroidvania is like saying Doom-clone, everyone understands what it means, but it's dumb
[0:38:23] <secret_npc> Video games are a new medium, we need our own weird descriptors
[0:38:30] <+Dova573> It should be called MetroidofTheNightania
[0:38:31] <%fitzsquilliam> castlevania is the metroid of metroidvania
[0:38:34] <+Ace_Flibble> I think of Arkham Asylum more than any actual Castlevania or Metroid, now.
[0:38:37] <%Agami23> zelda is a metroidvania
[0:38:45] <T_Sasquatch> we should ban materoidvanias from being made
[0:38:48] <teefpal> When are we going to get a 3d Metroid game that isn't Metroid Prime?
[0:38:49] <MayorRev> Souls-likes
[0:38:50] <TheNegligibleOne> or you see two words that aren't descriptive? its the issue all genres have of being exclusive to those in the know. Music genres get to a point deep down where they're meaningless unless you're SUPER in that scene
[0:38:51] <@ssjklyco> It's a shame Konami is gone now.
[0:38:52] <%Monkeyweed21> I cant wait for genres to devolve into some shit like "Persona-likes" or "Fortlite"
[0:38:52] <MayorRev> Roguelikes
[0:38:52] <%Meekest> Dark Souls is the Hollow Knight of 3D Metroidvanias
[0:38:53] <%Quigsies> Wish Dark Souls was as cool as Castlevania
[0:38:53] <+Dova573> DS IS 3D CASTLEVANIA
[0:38:55] <%Wurmspawn> As in like Castlevania 1 but 3d.
[0:38:57] <+FingaLights> @Ipsenscastle Rouge like works for the same
[0:38:57] <TheTakkster> Castlevania 64 4 lyfe
[0:38:58] <+SilverDevilfish> Dark Souls is the Mario 64 of Castlevania
[0:38:58] <wolverinewaswrong> is prey a metroidvania and immersive sim?
[0:38:58] <MayorRev> theres a lot of -likes
[0:38:59] <%RealThiele> Castlevania 64 HAD A MOTORCYCLE SKELETON
[0:39:00] <TheNegligibleOne> I don't dislike Metrovania tho
[0:39:01] <+Dova573> BloodBorne EVEN MORE
[0:39:02] <%aBlueWizard> i did :(
[0:39:05] <secret_npc> I did not
[0:39:05] <%aBlueWizard> i'm very old
[0:39:06] <+beansoup> i feel like calling DS a castlevania game sells DS short.
[0:39:09] <%Monkeyweed21> ITS ROUGH
[0:39:11] <TourettesPlays> Yes Pat we're not fifty years old
[0:39:11] <teefpal> Holy shit YOU ARE OLD
[0:39:11] <%JoshManVGH> Bloodborne is FOR SURE a Castlevania like game
[0:39:13] <xanerts> Bloodborne is just Castlevania 3d
[0:39:14] <%crimsonharvest> old crew step up
[0:39:15] <%Ipsenscastle> @FingaLights yeah exactly, that's another good example
[0:39:16] <%trackles_64> I wasnt born then
[0:39:16] <DianaTheAscian> oh yeah no I played that decades after
[0:39:17] <%GalacticaPhanto> @agami23 Zelda 2 is super a Metroidvania

[0:39:21] <@tizz86> 90

[0:39:49] <%Agami23> castlevania is a jank platformer
[0:39:51] <%Monkeyweed21> why does Dracula turn into the Cookie Monster
[0:39:53] <%RealThiele> Simons Quest is a walking sim
[0:39:55] <%aBlueWizard> One of my favorite child hood memories is playing castlevania 2 with my mom watching cuz she liked weird horror shit and vampires
[0:39:57] <+Ace_Flibble> 1986 on NES

[0:40:18] <+Ace_Flibble> It was rereleased in 1993
[0:40:21] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt do you like Castlevania 1 or 3 more?
[0:40:21] <%dooscent> @PatStaresAt the universal monsters are your enemy, but the main boss is gravity
[0:40:28] <%aBlueWizard> once you jump YOU ARE COMMITED
[0:40:30] <%zeroarturia> Stiff jumps
[0:40:31] <%AmericanSkidd> I wanna play games as told by TerminalMontage
[0:40:32] <zhenthrim213> BOY DID YOU
[0:40:33] <%Ipsenscastle> Castlevania and Metroid jumping is so awful
[0:40:34] <DianaTheAscian> Big commit
[0:40:35] <+dd44dostivei> castlevania 1 is a suuuuper early nes game
[0:40:38] <%aBlueWizard> the main enemy are BIRDS
[0:40:46] <%MoguManda> jump king jumps
[0:40:47] <secret_npc> The controls in Dark Souls are fucked too!
[0:40:49] <+every_loyal_son> Whip to win
[0:40:53] <%JoshManVGH> Made those Medusa Heads fucking maddening.
[0:40:55] <%crimsonharvest> Thats why La Mulana is so badass
[0:40:56] <Consumanist> "Functional Alcoholic saves Europe from Vampire Colonialism"
[0:40:56] <%Bt_Robot> Leveling up through player skill instead of character skill.
[0:41:02] <%MoguManda> it's supposed to be fucked
[0:41:04] <Nightwolf656> LUL
[0:41:06] <DianaTheAscian> well you can cancel some shit
[0:41:07] <artoflec> yeah souls combat is kinda bad elaSmile
[0:41:07] <secret_npc> I think the different camera perspectives makes the Castlevania comparison confusing
[0:41:09] <TheAntiNihilist> isn't Metroid JUST an improved version of Castlevania though?
[0:41:09] <%doc_ock_rokc> ITS CLUNKY AND FUN
[0:41:10] <wolverinewaswrong> the dark souls of metroidvania games
[0:41:11] <Minorou> couldn't get into monster hunter until dark souls got me in
[0:41:11] <DeepPix3l> It's almost like swinging a sword is really hard and you cant stop that shit lol
[0:41:14] <secret_npc> But it's on point
[0:41:17] <%Ipsenscastle> original Prince of Persia jumping
[0:41:18] <%MoguManda> death cancel
[0:41:19] <%crimsonharvest> none of you fucks probably even took la mulana seriously as a metroidvania but damn you missed out
[0:41:25] <+Dova573> But with Symphony of the nights exploration
[0:41:25] <+Ace_Flibble> I couldn't cope with Castlevania when it was new because I was too used to Prince Of Persia which was super slick for the time.
[0:41:27] <%RealThiele> with the lore of castlevania 2
[0:41:28] <%doc_ock_rokc> Castlevania 1 was fun but FUCK THOSE HEADS
[0:41:30] <+every_loyal_son> Nah whip it. Whip it good.
[0:41:32] <%aBlueWizard> Castllevania 64 is an abomination and i love it
[0:41:32] <28moogles> Curse of Darkness is good, I'll die on that hill.
[0:41:34] <teefpal> Rolling Thunder is a genre type that needs to come back
[0:41:36] <@tizz86> castlevania 64.....
[0:41:38] <%RedSqurrl> That Castlevania anime tho
[0:41:38] <%GalacticaPhanto> Curse of Darkness is cool shhhh
[0:41:41] <Consumanist> hold up there mister!
[0:41:43] <Blank9> the 2nd n64 one is good
[0:41:44] <TheNegligibleOne> Hey Lord's of SHadow was good, it just wasn't castlevania
[0:41:46] <teefpal> Castlevania 64
[0:41:47] <TheAntiNihilist> I love Lords of shadow
[0:41:52] <%RealThiele> FRANKENSTEIN HAD A CHAINSAW IN N64
[0:41:52] <%ironohki> ironohki subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 33 months! Hey Pat. Got back into Destiny 2 for a bit. Story got real good BUT GUESS WHAT? Gameplay is still Destiny 2! Keep not playing, watch Byf instead.
[0:41:54] <+dd44dostivei> MOTORCYCLE SKELETONS
[0:42:02] <luftraumm1> don't enjoy any castlevania at all
[0:42:04] <TourettesPlays> 99% of the NES library is trash and the other 1% is Mario 3
[0:42:05] <susukouhai> no shut up tho Lament of Innocence was good
[0:42:05] <DeepPix3l> Dark Souls is basically just a 3d Castlevania
[0:42:07] <T_Sasquatch> ive tried multiple castlevania games, never liked it
[0:42:09] <%pokefan9956> hey pat, what genre is botw
[0:42:10] <%Agami23> man, i dont know what genre harmony of despair is but i need more
[0:42:14] <KaiserMario> GoW clones were a genre too LUL
[0:42:15] <MayorRev> @PatStaresAt Team Fortress was the original Hero Shooter
[0:42:15] <teefpal> MecurySteam made both games
[0:42:18] <28moogles> Curse of Darkness is the perfect 3D Castlevania for it's era but nobody played it.
[0:42:19] <%Treuan> It really does
[0:42:23] <%Ipsenscastle> I liked Lords of Shadow 1 better than the ps2/3 God of Wars
[0:42:23] <%MoguManda> just play as Maria so you can fly infinitely
[0:42:25] <secret_npc> Kojima Presents
[0:42:25] <%dooscent> call zobek
[0:42:25] <%aBlueWizard> playing it not on 360 and it's pretty damn gorgeous
[0:42:27] <TheAntiNihilist> lol it ran PERFECTLY on Playstation
[0:42:29] <feefer_drunk3rland> Cinematic FPS
[0:42:36] <Consumanist> God of War clone, wow i never thought i'd hear that term brought up again
[0:42:36] <%moonmintparadise> A Castlevania game that is a bit of a slower Dark Souls challenge would be awesome
[0:42:37] <@tizz86> i maybe played ps3 version for like 4hrs
[0:42:40] <%Torus1025> Did Drakengard 3 ever come out on the 360?
[0:42:45] <%RealThiele> its god of war with patrick stewart
[0:42:48] <TheNegligibleOne> Some of those frame perfect qtes with low framerates were impossiblefor baby me
[0:42:49] <%MoguManda> psaWrong
[0:42:49] <alrobot2014> is it consistent 23.9?
[0:42:50] <secret_npc> What Kojima actually contribute to that?
[0:42:51] <blackjack8182> The whip kills the framerate
[0:42:55] <28moogles> Lament of Innocence is... uhhh. a cool title, though
[0:42:56] <%Wurmspawn> Might be a contraversial opinion, but I liked Lament of Innocence.
[0:43:00] <chainsaw105> I was fighting for my fuckin life in SotN until I read that the Shield Rod and Alucard shield were busted as fuck
[0:43:00] <bob900000> it hit 60 for me /s
[0:43:01] <Consumanist> Playstation didn't run well on playstation!
[0:43:02] <%Bt_Robot> does that mean Dawn of Sorrow is terrible because it had 3D backgrounds?
[0:43:04] <+Ace_Flibble> most PS1 games other than fighters ran at 15fps
[0:43:12] <%NocturneNovember> I've seen Gigaboots play LoS two years ago, it's pretty bad overall
[0:43:14] <%aBlueWizard> yeah well all the 3d castlevania's have great music
[0:43:20] <%aBlueWizard> and i'll fight everyone on twitch on that hill
[0:43:22] <TheAntiNihilist> yes it did. it at least looked good on ps3
[0:43:22] <%AmericanSkidd> Are you gonna... Stare at it?
[0:43:23] <+elderpunch> hey pat and chat
[0:43:32] <%RealThiele> Dawn of Sorrow loses points because of TERRIBLE ITEM DROP %
[0:43:44] <%ironohki> Hello back at you, @elderpunch.
[0:43:44] <%YakumoYomi> Sup, Elderpunch
[0:43:47] <+unhuggable1> 17 DAMN THATS FAST

[0:43:49] <secret_npc> nice
[0:43:51] <%AmericanSkidd> that is TRASH
[0:43:53] <%ironohki> That's a hecking good name, sir.
[0:43:54] <%NopeBadguy> YOU OVERESTIMATED!?
[0:43:54] <TheNegligibleOne> how did the ps3 run it better?
[0:43:54] <Consumanist> that stings
[0:43:54] <TourettesPlays> PEE ESS TRIPLE ALWAYS WINS BABY
[0:43:55] <HyperionXV> PogChamp
[0:43:57] <+Ace_Flibble> hells yeah everything's trash
[0:43:59] <+polothegreatest> WAT?
[0:44:00] <KaiserMario> Ran better on PS3 like the guy said LUL
[0:44:02] <blackjack8182> 17! Wooo
[0:44:07] <%RealThiele> those 3 frames hell yeah
[0:44:10] <+megaman_sentinel> just thinking about that make my eyes hurt
[0:44:15] <TheAntiNihilist> ????? go play the game NOW. IT IS NOT BAD AT ALL
[0:44:15] <nyacoo> 17! LUL
[0:44:20] <%hrbeck_> The worst gen
[0:44:24] <%4DLuvOfLuthy> the TRUE gaming experience
[0:44:27] <+dd44dostivei> pat, name some good NES games for the zoomers
[0:44:27] <susukouhai> @Wurmspawn not that controversial, it was a p decent DMC clone before we got Dmc3
[0:44:30] <godzookylives> Ocarina of Time bullshit
[0:44:31] <%SaiyanShoto> Even lower than what your eyeball saw LUL
[0:44:33] <%RealThiele> Cinematic
[0:44:35] <Radioactive_Jam > ouch
[0:44:42] <%shurtal> what gMe is this?
[0:44:43] <%MoguManda> the older you get the more frames you see
[0:44:43] <Consumanist> 30!? we did it boy's time to pack up and head home
[0:44:44] <+Ace_Flibble> Everything after the PS2 was a mistake.
[0:44:46] <bob900000> man the 360/ps3 had so many problems
[0:44:46] <helios_io> now THATS Cinematic
[0:44:51] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt wasn't that most games then?
[0:44:53] <%ironohki> YEY GENRES!
[0:44:58] <%NopeBadguy> IT'S TIME TO SAVE TOO CHUNKY
[0:44:58] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Best waste of life
[0:44:59] <%AmericanSkidd> Kingdom Hearts is my favorite DMC like
[0:45:00] <%Ipsenscastle> do puzzle games next
[0:45:02] <@ssjklyco> What is Dead Rising?
[0:45:03] <%Ynkubus_> Again?
[0:45:03] <DianaTheAscian> by far
[0:45:03] <KaiserMario> I actually really like the genre talk
[0:45:04] <%BoxNavy> yeah
[0:45:05] <%aBlueWizard> Agreed
[0:45:05] <%MoguManda> it's true!!
[0:45:05] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> agreed
[0:45:06] <%YakumoYomi> "Wasted"? I beg to differ
[0:45:06] <TheNegligibleOne> It was the worst best
[0:45:08] <+unhuggable1> agreed
[0:45:08] <%Ipsenscastle> no question at all
[0:45:08] <%Treuan> Oh yeah. PS3 to this day has no games
[0:45:09] <%emperordread> The unreal engine generation
[0:45:09] <chainsaw105> SotN is hard until you get Shield Rod and Alucard shield
[0:45:09] <bob900000> 100%
[0:45:09] <%afronooch> yeah i pretty skipped it
[0:45:09] <%RealThiele> MORE
[0:45:10] <PanicSwytch> Absolutely agree
[0:45:11] <%SveriSageAdvice> that online pass shit ruined so many games including Mass Effect
[0:45:11] <Zudrag> what games were the worst again? the nothing?
[0:45:11] <wolverinewaswrong> yeah thats fair tbh
[0:45:11] <%Puhff> !uptime
[0:45:12] <@Moobot> @Puhff I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 45m 30s.
[0:45:14] <kjb343> based
[0:45:14] <teefpal> VoteYea
[0:45:14] <stantheman_97> ATARI YOU FUCK
[0:45:14] <%Bt_Robot> @RealThiele There are skills and items that negate that effect, it's the entire reason they integrated the equipment switching into the game
[0:45:14] <%Rikufmix21> atari was kind of ass
[0:45:14] <$StrawberryPantsu> I was about to say PS1/N64
[0:45:15] <TourettesPlays> Pat include the Wii in there cmon it won that gen so hard
[0:45:15] <Consumanist> you must be taking the piss
[0:45:16] <%Wurmspawn> PAt, if YOUR life was a game, what genre would it be?
[0:45:17] <+ThomasOfTroy> In this century, yes, it was the worst
[0:45:17] <$StrawberryPantsu> But PS1
[0:45:17] <secret_npc> Pat will you do a stream of the first dungeon in Dark Cloud, and ONLY the first dungeon?
[0:45:18] <TheNegligibleOne> All the bad stuff, but also a lot of good stuff
[0:45:19] <%JoshManVGH> But there where some stellar things
[0:45:20] <%BoxNavy> there was some good stuff though
[0:45:20] <%ahomeschooldropout> There's like only a handful of games from that era I liked
[0:45:21] <DeepPix3l> No. Atari up to the NES
[0:45:21] <Daxalog> Even for pc?
[0:45:21] <%NopeBadguy> Okay it was bad, but the WORST?
[0:45:22] <+JustToWatch> IT WASN'T GREAT
[0:45:23] <wolverinewaswrong> even if I have nostalgia for it
[0:45:24] <DianaTheAscian> nobody gonna fight you on that Pat
[0:45:24] <bob900000> I'm glad I skipped it
[0:45:25] <alrobot2014> except for the year 2007
[0:45:26] <digaogrunge> Made me quit console gaming
[0:45:26] <%MoguManda> at the peak of gamefly too
[0:45:28] <robosqueeb> it was ambitious
[0:45:28] <cooldude69xx> But, what about waist high cover?
[0:45:29] <%NopeBadguy> NES era had so much shovelware
[0:45:30] <%jtdobyns> everyone loved the red ring of death
[0:45:31] <blackjack8182> Rough Times for sure!
[0:45:31] <%SaiyanShoto> Wasted?
[0:45:32] <%Bt_Robot> But Dark Souls...
[0:45:32] <spartanluchador534> Shoutout to skyrim on ps3
[0:45:34] <Nightwolf656> For sure but we did get a few diamonds outta that era
[0:45:36] <28moogles> Worst? Maybe.  Terrible? Nah, there's amazing games from that gen.
[0:45:36] <%crimsonharvest> speaking of genres i SUPER MISS the first person dungeon crawler im fucking dying here without good modern ones
[0:45:38] <DeepPix3l> Categorically wrong
[0:45:38] <%Ipsenscastle> videogames started with the SNES and Mega Drive
[0:45:38] <%RealThiele> @RealThiele But big STR number tho :(
[0:45:40] <teefpal> Videogames were barely functioning in the Atari era, they dont count
[0:45:40] <wolverinewaswrong> bloom
[0:45:42] <%NopeBadguy> NES/SNES/Genesis had SO much shovelware dude
[0:45:42] <+JustToWatch> some good character action games though
[0:45:42] <Consumanist> a bad time to be alive
[0:45:43] <%Agami23> theres a few games i really want to play that are locked on PS3, but i dont want to because the ps3 fucking sucks
[0:45:43] <%Lefanque> only generation I didn't own consoles for because i didn't want to play anything
[0:45:43] <%BirdmanCnC> it's nice being here for the streak instead of catching up on YT vids lol
[0:45:43] <TourettesPlays> Atari is the Pre Cambrian period of video games and almost doesnt count
[0:45:45] <%Garthunox> P5 IS TECHNICALLY A LAST GEN GAME
[0:45:45] <%JoshManVGH> Vanquish, Bayonetta, MSG Revengence, Lost Odyssey.
[0:45:46] <kjb343> sucked shit with a few good games to make it not seem as bad
[0:45:48] <teefpal> The Seventh Gen has no such exuse
[0:45:49] <%rumtumtugnutz> remember the psa3 batarang
[0:45:49] <%SaiyanShoto> Completely agree, it’s where all the worst tropes came out of
[0:45:51] <stantheman_97> YOU CAN'T PRETEND IT DIDN'T HAPPEN
[0:45:51] <TheFramedWarlock> Atari was proto-Videogames
[0:45:52] <nyacoo> stone age
[0:45:54] <%hrbeck_> it's hard to count the one that almost killed the whole medium
[0:45:56] <secret_npc> Eh it was worth a shot
[0:45:57] <%Garthunox> AND BY LAST GEN I MEAN PS3
[0:45:57] <DianaTheAscian> the kingiof shovelware was the Wii
[0:45:57] <feefer_drunk3rland> ah yes xbox360/ps3 gen where capcom said fuck it and made all games bad that gen (except SF4)
[0:46:01] <%PocketBearIllustrator> peopoh!
[0:46:02] <%cha0tic_klutch> What makes it worse than the ps4 generation?
[0:46:03] <+BeardedLuchador> I highkey think theres no ps3 backwards compat bc the Cell processor was so ass
[0:46:04] <stantheman_97> LUL
[0:46:04] <feefer_drunk3rland> (and mvc3)
[0:46:07] <robosqueeb> like they say, in the stone age...
[0:46:08] <TourettesPlays> Thanks!
[0:46:10] <@ssjklyco> What d0es that mean?
[0:46:11] <%peachy996> Big Chunky PS3 dying was the worst. RIP Peach669
[0:46:12] <Consumanist> i wish i knew what that ment
[0:46:12] <%SaiyanShoto> Games all had the same ugly color palette in that gen
[0:46:13] <%Meekest> Honestly big claps
[0:46:13] <artoflec> the good games ran like shit and the bad games spilled garbage into good games
[0:46:14] <Finaldragoon> 32-Bit before PS1 though, fucking 3DO/CDi/32X/Sega-CD nonsense. that's the worst generation
[0:46:15] <%ironohki> "Atari = Pre Cambrian" Nice, whoever said that.
[0:46:16] <%SaphronBlackbourne> Snooze at Castlevania I'm gonna Metroid instead
[0:46:19] <TheNegligibleOne> 360 era gave us Dark Souls, gave us a rogue esque genre definer game. SO there's some gold in that shit
[0:46:21] <%shurtal> si much wood in an atari, its basically a board game @patstaresat
[0:46:21] <%BoxNavy> NO
[0:46:22] <%YakumoYomi> @spartanluchador534 Can you believe critics gave that game glowing reviews? Skyrim PS3 was terrible at launch.
[0:46:23] <mesamus> @feefer_drunk3rland devil may cry 4
[0:46:23] <teefpal> Awwwwwww
[0:46:24] <bob900000> no thanks

[0:46:59] <%Rikufmix21> ill play it on the ps3 i dont care its the goat
[0:46:59] <wolverinewaswrong> oblivion was my least favourite elder scrolls game
[0:46:59] <feefer_drunk3rland> @mesamus great gameplay too bad it wasn't finished
[0:47:00] <superchunk121> I played it on ps3 :)
[0:47:00] <%DrTomT18> I played Oblivion with a memory card and I LIKED IT
[0:47:00] <anAngryHamster> Patrick  Stewart got his money
[0:47:02] <%Puhff> you doing big eyes always freaks me out
[0:47:03] <%count_bob> I liked Oblivion.
[0:47:06] <+every_loyal_son> Ooooh
[0:47:08] <%peachy996> Hey Pat wanna play MK9?! Well ya can't cuz PSN went down for 8 months!
[0:47:09] <Shockmaster182> Oblivion is great as long as you don’t play it
[0:47:09] <GarbageQueenEllie> oh NOOOO. With the expanded cities mods? Forget it
[0:47:10] <$Futurecity10> I’m fine with that
[0:47:11] <TourettesPlays> @rumtumtugnutz Atari was the only system that devs could independtly release games on
[0:47:13] <+BeardedLuchador> Thats my xp every time with TES games Kappa
[0:47:13] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> the Xbox 360 Arcade
[0:47:14] <teefpal> I can't believe Oblivion was a released game
[0:47:17] <$Futurecity10> I grew up with that
[0:47:19] <MittensBroadcast> didnt the both have problems where tehy just bricked
[0:47:19] <robosqueeb> the memory cards though LMFAO
[0:47:22] <%JoshManVGH> Ooooh no!
[0:47:23] <%baka_sugoi> god NotLikeThis NotLikeThis sbfpSetIn
[0:47:24] <Radioactive_Jam > remember when horse armour was big deal?
[0:47:25] <Consumanist> And that's saying alot for microsoft
[0:47:25] <+Ace_Flibble> @RealThiele Samurai Warriors 5 has brought horse armour DLC back, just two weeks ago. The dream is still alive!
[0:47:29] <%ironohki> "Everytime big die!" Pasta Rat 2021
[0:47:29] <%Bt_Robot> Attacking Sheogorath completely redeemed that game.
[0:47:30] <TheNegligibleOne> I beat Oblivion lvl 2 like a good gamer
[0:47:31] <teefpal> People shit on Cyberpunk but Oblivion was far worse
[0:47:32] <%crimsonharvest> 128mb of memory for game assets and NO CACHING
[0:47:32] <+ThomasOfTroy> Playing Bayo was a struggle every time you went to heal
[0:47:35] <+polothegreatest> yeah hdd sucked back then
[0:47:35] <spartanluchador534> the ps3 just took an hour to load skrim
[0:47:35] <%MidnightBurst12> Who thought that was a good idea? LUL
[0:47:36] <+dd44dostivei> SKYBLIVION THO
[0:47:38] <%RealThiele> LUL
[0:47:39] <%JoshManVGH> That disc drive did some laps!
[0:47:40] <%toolofparanoia> dedest
[0:47:40] <%peachy996> Remember when PSN had month long outage
[0:47:45] <+megaman_sentinel> we survive that error stop bringing it up
[0:47:45] <%AmericanSkidd> Xbox Live Indie Games was a mistake that I love happened
[0:47:47] <TourettesPlays> Doesnt every creation engine game when played on PS3 have horrible save bloat that limits your play time to like 30~ hours???
[0:47:49] <alrobot2014> i played oblivion on a laptop with an amd card and the lighting straight up didn't work right
[0:47:51] <%PocketBearIllustrator> I didn't even know 360's without HDDs were a thing.
[0:47:55] <%hrbeck_> pre-cambrian is like you taught a raspberry pi to play spore to spit out bullshit
[0:47:58] <+Ace_Flibble> Koei Tecmo just put out horse armour DLC two weeks ago.
[0:48:17] <secret_npc> Was there any loading screen that made shitty load times bearable?
[0:48:21] <%Rikufmix21> have you ever seen new vegas on the ps3, if your save file got too big the game would literally drop below one fps
[0:48:26] <%RealThiele> Paige, Pat, and Elmo, run by Eli
[0:48:28] <scrumbotime> More or less, you have to both be "your character" and also not so "in character" that you derail things too hard
[0:48:34] <%rumtumtugnutz> @TourettesPlays But if you count the Lynx and the Jaguar, Atari was making new hardware into the N64 era.
[0:48:35] <%SaphronBlackbourne> @TourettesPlays Yep!!!
[0:48:36] <%peachy996> Good Deshrision
[0:48:47] <TheNegligibleOne> oh boy horse armour
[0:48:54] <Consumanist> The original Xbox had a pretty beafy HDD for it's time, they took a few steps back with the Xbox360
[0:48:57] <%toolofparanoia> Pat seems like the type to DM.
[0:48:58] <%Treuan> GW2 is like the best candidate for controller support what
[0:48:58] <%deviljhojho_> Would guild wars be better with controller? huh
[0:49:00] <Latija> doesn't gw2 have like 6 buttons?
[0:49:07] <%MrDemsus> I can try asking a person i know there
[0:49:10] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt it was one guy's pet project and then it never got finished
[0:49:14] <artoflec> isnmt guild wars actionny too?
[0:49:15] <%SovPho> GW2 feels like it SHOULD have a controller
[0:49:16] <+itsKrisD> my friend plays guild wars with his elite controller
[0:49:21] <%RealThiele> i use DS4 windows and just remap shit
[0:49:23] <%crimsonharvest> the icons are just a relic of compiling with visual studio
[0:49:29] <%deviljhojho_> oh ma
[0:49:31] <%TheDugness> TheDugness subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 15 months! happy fifteen months big papa give zangief a kiss on his burgers for me and tell elmo he is a handsome man damn it I wish he was a mount in ff14
[0:49:37] <%jillyrancher> heya chat
[0:49:38] <%Monkeyweed21> 15 total buttons @PatStaresAt
[0:49:41] <@QueequegTheater> I have been enjoying the WoW guild getting absolutely dominated by E3S
[0:49:43] <anAngryHamster> Not for an engineer
[0:49:43] <chainsaw105> Pat help, my friend is going to play the entire Yakuza series with keyboard controls because he's too stubborn to buy a controller. what do?
[0:49:44] <%Keaton_x> I would pay extra just for controller support
[0:49:44] <IntrepidEye> @TourettesPlays At about 30 you start noticing the frame drops and it crashes more often. At 50 it starts being literally unplayable where it starts crashing trying to load a save
[0:49:46] <%doc_ock_rokc> Hey pat, I got my first paycheck and my fun item for it is a new controler what is your suggestion for a good PC controler
[0:49:49] <+Ace_Flibble> There are community mods that get controllers working in GW2. They just... break every time the game is updated.
[0:49:58] <%SovPho> GW2 is ok
[0:50:00] <+every_loyal_son> Just baffling
[0:50:05] <%RealThiele> i mean you could even do WoW on controller if you are crazy enough
[0:50:07] <%Agami23> i should do that too
[0:50:08] <$StrawberryPantsu> I need to get on that too
[0:50:08] <DeepPix3l> Dragon's Dogma has the best scheme for more buttons than the controller can handle.
[0:50:09] <thep3asantking> Perfect idea
[0:50:19] <DianaTheAscian> y?
[0:50:19] <digaogrunge> OH NO
[0:50:21] <%baka_sugoi> big SAD
[0:50:21] <Crownaux0> *binge it all in one day

[0:50:30] <zhenthrim213> thats a bad time
[0:50:31] <%KeiganOfAstora> I did the same, I'm rewatching 3.0 before watching the new oen
[0:50:32] <+RedQueensAce> its very uncomfortable
[0:50:32] <scrumbotime> Oh yeah no, that's like if you tried to binge Bojack, you'll hollow out
[0:50:32] <$StrawberryPantsu> I'm going to get high as shit and marathon the whole thing
[0:50:32] <Savior127> 3 and 4 was s h i t

[0:50:35] <stantheman_97> i was fine
[0:50:35] <%hrbeck_> should have told 12 year old me

[0:50:37] <robosqueeb> worse than i already do?
[0:50:38] <%Ravioli_Ronin> It’s true, I let the whole series run once NotLikeThis dnmO
[0:50:39] <Daxalog> I binged it. Was fun watch
[0:50:39] <blastazoid00> COWARD
[0:50:40] <@ssjklyco> Compared to Bojack?
[0:50:40] <%maenos2> man I marathoned all berserk in one night I can handle it
[0:50:40] <+Dova573> But thast everyday for me
[0:50:40] <%jillyrancher> @patstaresat Who is best girl Pat
[0:50:43] <bob900000> I guess there's something wrong with me than
[0:50:44] <%AmericanSkidd> I did it was a bad call on my part
[0:50:44] <Reborn2killu> i want to feel awfull though
[0:50:44] <%ironohki> Feels Badman.
[0:50:44] <secret_npc> I paced myself with the Eva show and I was so lost
[0:50:45] <%MoguManda> big sad
[0:50:45] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt I watched the whole series plus EoE in one day, it was awesome
[0:50:45] <%twistedj3ster> I watched 1 and a half and quit
[0:50:46] <+dd44dostivei> i can't do evangelion a third time
[0:50:46] <+every_loyal_son> Eva is depressing
[0:50:46] <General_Terro> what if you're already dead inside
[0:50:46] <%Pappajimbo> tumbling down tumbling down
[0:50:46] <%JoshManVGH> Yeah... watching all of rebuild in one sitting was a mistake

[0:50:47] <nyacoo> i always feel bad tho
[0:50:47] <+Dova573> Andddd
[0:50:48] <%Ravioli_Ronin> dnmSadge dnmSadge dnmSadge dnmSadge
[0:50:48] <%Torus1025> @patstaresat I binged the whole series inna day while high and I felt like SHIT
[0:50:48] <alrobot2014> i did a full rebuild rewatch the day after it came, i can't imagine doing the entire series AND the movies
[0:50:49] <Consumanist> What if i already hit my feeling bad threshold?
[0:50:50] <DeepPix3l> The dancing episode's pretty fun
[0:50:50] <%BirdmanCnC> I binged it
[0:50:51] <%SaphronBlackbourne> I love depressing things though
[0:50:51] <Blank9> is it on netflix still? if so you should binge it all in one sitting
[0:50:51] <%KeiganOfAstora> It's very depressing
[0:50:52] <+kullumanati> Per doctor Pat
[0:50:52] <%afronooch> *intro
[0:50:53] <%BoxNavy> the entire
[0:50:54] <%peachy996> You'll love Orange Juice though

[0:50:57] <%Monkeyweed21> Just alternate episodes with Gurren Lagann
[0:50:57] <%DrTomT18> neither is Breaking Bad or Law and Order but I binge those shows
[0:50:59] <%Bt_Robot> Yoko Taro should have a writing credit, that's how sad it is
[0:50:59] <secret_npc> Eva isn't depressing
[0:51:01] <+kekkerscrew> Watch one episode of Gurren Lagann after every two episodes of Evangalion
[0:51:02] <%KetsuoTaberu> LUL
[0:51:06] <GamerWorlock> That's my normal state of being
[0:51:06] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> LUL LUL LUL
[0:51:06] <%SaiyanShoto> I binged it

[0:51:14] <%RealThiele> NEW STARWARS ANIMATRIX LOOKS RAD THO
[0:51:14] <%BoxNavy> queequeg is a mod now? monkaS
[0:51:14] <secret_npc> Eva isn't depressing y'all just babies
[0:51:16] <%SaphronBlackbourne> I desire more miserable media
[0:51:17] <28moogles> I binged it in like three days but I was an angsty teen so it worked
[0:51:17] <+Dova573> I binged Bojack Horseman i think I can handle it
[0:51:17] <%toolofparanoia> i recently watched the series like last year again, oringinal not netflix and the movie, need to rewatch the rebuilds
[0:51:17] <linSP> yes I am too happy, blease give sad bad feel
[0:51:19] <+GuilKato> Pat he gets to pilot a giant biomechanical construct just focus on that the you can binge it all in one hit
[0:51:20] <%deviljhojho_> the unhinged gentleman's method
[0:51:20] <%SaiyanShoto> I felt the same after binging it LUL
[0:51:23] <%baka_sugoi> LUL
[0:51:24] <stantheman_97> but maybe because i found it relatable
[0:51:25] <luftraumm1> devil man crybaby is bad but it can't scratch eva
[0:51:26] <%peachy996> Tekk War?
[0:51:33] <notsoy> lol i definitely remember hearing that specific sentence in anime for like 5 years
[0:51:36] <%Ravioli_Ronin> End of Eva = chatVibes
[0:51:37] <+every_loyal_son> Nah Gendo taught us how to shave. Best dad
[0:51:38] <Crownaux0> 上手ね
[0:51:42] <Nightwolf656> @kekkerscrew Really??? What about episode 8
[0:51:46] <rytisone> I can't believe Pen Pen was behind it all
[0:51:46] <%ironohki> I want Pat to pilot a giant biomechanical construct.
[0:51:50] <%jillyrancher> Rei is cool
[0:51:54] <Consumanist> Balance it out with a few episodes of "Redo of Healer"
[0:51:56] <GarbageQueenEllie> "When those bitches in EVA cried about the end of the world, I LOL'D"
[0:51:58] <semachie> cultured pat
[0:51:58] <anAngryHamster> My favorite part of Evangelion is when Shinji called Asuka's fursona cringe
[0:52:04] <%SovPho> The Ascent is lackluster.
[0:52:04] <%peachy996> Please bring it back. Suddenly EA is quiet on this now
[0:52:08] <luftraumm1> he does, what do you think paige is?
[0:52:10] <%MoguManda> ascent is a bag of garbage
[0:52:11] <%DrTomT18> If they re-made the ME3 online with Titanfall 2 style of unlocking with be amazing
[0:52:19] <IntrepidEye> Blessed Unleashed is trash.
[0:52:20] <%jillyrancher> please bring it back
[0:52:20] <secret_npc> Eva was only good back in the day, it can't be penetrated with the same appreciation now
[0:52:23] <%Bt_Robot> Final Fantasy 14 clone
[0:52:23] <%Monkeyweed21> I love Woolie's description of the "EVA merch universe" where everyone is happy
[0:52:24] <%Agami23> still sad pat didnt like lost in vivo. seemed like the type of game for him
[0:52:26] <+beansoup> i thoughy the ascent was pretty fun.
[0:52:27] <%RealThiele> Boyfriend Dungeon stream when
[0:52:28] <luftraumm1> ascent seemed super good tho
[0:52:32] <%SovPho> it's not an awful game but it's just nothing to write home about
[0:52:36] <%Ravioli_Ronin> All I want is ME3 multiplayer
[0:52:37] <%Bt_Robot> It has fake Lalafels
[0:52:39] <%peachy996> Speaking of Fake Video Games, What is the deal with Witch Fire?
[0:52:42] <%SovPho> It's just inoffensive.
[0:52:42] <+beansoup> i liked it
[0:52:43] <%DrTomT18> Its good, but it needs some bug patches
[0:52:44] <%jillyrancher> wait Ascent is Diablo like? nice
[0:52:45] <%BoxNavy> its a game
[0:52:45] <IntrepidEye> Its boring
[0:52:45] <%trackles_64> its a top down indie game
[0:52:47] <secret_npc> The Ascent is pretty
[0:52:47] <%BoxNavy> you play it
[0:52:47] <GarbageQueenEllie> Bless Unleashed sounds like a mod with Bless as Starkiller
[0:52:48] <%peachy996> That's been in development forever
[0:52:48] <%MoguManda> it's good or bad, nobody knows
[0:52:51] <kingra> It's up
[0:52:53] <%moonmintparadise> its pretty good for a gamepass game
[0:52:55] <Dunmarkh> it looks real good, my shit pc can't run it
[0:52:57] <Astrophizz> it's buggy but had incredible world design
[0:52:57] <SQDizzy> you ascend
[0:52:57] <luftraumm1> what is the boyfriend dungeon beef chat?
[0:52:57] <%Bt_Robot> Cyberpunk apocalypse
[0:52:58] <@QueequegTheater> Is Bless one of those games that would have been falsely marketed as "WoW killer"
[0:53:01] <%bevyrage> the ascent is one of those games you either get into deep or bounce the fuck off of it
[0:53:01] <digaogrunge> Looks good
[0:53:03] <secret_npc> The enviroments look detailed like a PS1 FF
[0:53:03] <+every_loyal_son> Good trash
[0:53:04] <%RealThiele> it got overdeveloped and performs poorly
[0:53:05] <%AgniBrandt> The Ascent is fun, but its game pass version was (Maybe is?) fucked
[0:53:06] <+wmeldrum> hello all, hope you're doing well
[0:53:06] <+kullumanati> Do solo
[0:53:11] <%MoguManda> are you gonna play Boyfriend Dungeon???
[0:53:11] <%jillyrancher> is it l gamepasa?
[0:53:16] <%peachy996> Hey Pat do you remember the trailer to Witchfire from the Game Awards?
[0:53:19] <%Bt_Robot> Very Monster Girls
[0:53:19] <Consumanist> Well there's your first problem
[0:53:22] <zhenthrim213> oh yea Lost Ruins is Anime
[0:53:28] <TheNegligibleOne> armour equips in game so you can wear a swimsuit, as wel all want to.
[0:53:32] <%Bt_Robot> plays well
[0:53:32] <IntrepidEye> It looks fucking fantastic but it didn't grab me
[0:53:33] <zhenthrim213> good tho
[0:53:34] <Dunmarkh> @luftraumm1 real people are mad at a fictional character
[0:53:34] <linSP> anime? Hmmm
[0:53:34] <%maenos2> what's it called again
[0:53:35] <secret_npc> Pat did you try Monster Sanctuary?
[0:53:35] <%Wurmspawn> You're not the first to make that comparison.
[0:53:39] <Finaldragoon> published by Dangen, fuck that
[0:53:40] <+kekkerscrew> @Nightwolf656 Well episode 8 of Gurren actually mixes well with episode 16 of Eva

[1:06:27] <%IamGrapes> didnt find it

[1:06:44] <%AmericanSkidd> bruh, I legit thought EVA was a mecha anime when I first watched it like 3 years ago
[1:06:46] <kingra> Yeah it will
[1:06:46] <%IamGrapes> 'great' is subjective
[1:06:47] <%DrTomT18> sounds like the perfect thing for me
[1:06:47] <%trackles_64> Try watyching Elfen Lied
[1:06:47] <%ironohki> Night In The Woods, also.
[1:06:52] <kingra> End of Eva is some shit
[1:06:52] <%InternetShis> Aight bet
[1:06:52] <scrumbotime> Damn, I forget that people are out there with like, none of those, just, out there calm as fuck
[1:06:55] <%Sotetsu> I feel the same way about Swiss Army Man
[1:06:56] <DeepPix3l> It's pretty intense
[1:06:58] <secret_npc> That's probably why it did nothing for me, a superior human
[1:06:59] <+vaderxyz1970> Jerking it to a coma patient
[1:07:01] <%twistedj3ster> This is why I've never seen it
[1:07:01] <%Agami23> thats why it makes it so weird for me to have evangellion characters in my action rpg gacha game
[1:07:01] <%PocketBearIllustrator> I still feel Neon Genesis > Rebuild
[1:07:03] <dekkitout> But then turns it around. Episode 26 is dope

[1:07:16] <+condemned_15> yup
[1:07:16] <+senfood> Evangelion helped me put my anxiety and exisstential dread in perspective. "At least my life isn't that bad. Fuck."
[1:07:17] <%InternetShis> Nah, I know
[1:07:19] <%trackles_64> Get in the damn Robot Pat
[1:07:19] <%KeiganOfAstora> Nah my dad's like that
[1:07:21] <+crimson_echidna> Evangelion 3.0 + 1.0 actually shocked me on how good it was because the first hour actually focused entirely on actually how to be a proper support unit to someone with depression.
[1:07:23] <%HaroldDonchee> eh shinji was just being a baby
[1:07:23] <Nightwolf656> o god i'm dying over here lol

[1:09:48] <%athuramn> @ssjklyco LUL
[1:09:50] <Sp3ctre48> Where's our cool Batarian teammate BibleThump
[1:09:54] <teefpal> Actual Sunlight and Little Red Lie are two games that will KILL your will to live
[1:09:55] <%RealThiele> cheat engine volus
[1:09:55] <%peachy996> Like they pull their weight well enough
[1:09:58] <%DrTomT18> Fallout 3 isn't that bad
[1:09:59] <Shade075> You could legit play AS a collector in that multiplayer, its nuts
[1:09:59] <%Ravioli_Ronin> Volus rip and tear
[1:10:01] <stantheman_97> they should have an elcor how is just a tank
[1:10:03] <Consumanist> Ever do Star Wars: The Old Republic?
[1:10:05] <dekkitout> Fallout 3 is not a far cry from Mass Effect
[1:10:05] <zhenthrim213> could be worse yea
[1:10:05] <@QueequegTheater> At least they're in the same ball park
[1:10:09] <teefpal> Fallout 3 is not a good game AT ALL
[1:10:11] <%kyh9> @Sp3ctre48 "Here's why slavery is okay, Shepard"
[1:10:15] <+vaderxyz1970> Volus BIOTIC GOD!
[1:10:15] <secret_npc> I played F3 and ME1 at the same time and both were great experiences
[1:10:15] <28moogles> Shooter RPG with choices
[1:10:16] <+polothegreatest> gta? easy yakuza game
[1:10:16] <%Garthunox> it sucks cos Citadel DLC has multiplayer characters in it talking about bullshit that could happen in the multiplayer
[1:10:16] <%DrTomT18> Sci fi games?
[1:10:18] <%AmericanSkidd> Bad Company?
[1:10:21] <%JoshManVGH> You shoot stuff ans select dialog
[1:10:23] <@QueequegTheater> Fallout 4 is just a better Fallout 3
[1:10:26] <PaperyHornet1013> the volus is a biotic god
[1:10:27] <@QueequegTheater> Kappa
[1:10:28] <%Agami23> RPG is the worst genre because anything can be a role playing game
[1:10:32] <%DrTomT18> Ha
[1:10:34] <%deviljhojho_> yeah same
[1:10:34] <teefpal> Yea
[1:10:35] <%Nobrev> same
[1:10:36] <kingra> LUL
[1:10:36] <Radioactive_Jam > lol same
[1:10:36] <GarbageQueenEllie> same
[1:10:37] <%deviljhojho_> make it 50 tho
[1:10:38] <%DrTomT18> damn pat.
[1:10:39] <Dunmarkh> LUL NotLikeThis
[1:10:40] <secret_npc> Same
[1:10:40] <ape_hawk> fo3 is a good game
[1:10:41] <dekkitout> It's a good sandbox
[1:10:41] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> pretty much lol
[1:10:42] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> its like dumb fun
[1:10:42] <%KeiganOfAstora> Nooo Fallout 3 is good
[1:10:42] <zhenthrim213> yes me too
[1:10:43] <kingra> Yea
[1:10:44] <mr_saturday93> LUL
[1:10:44] <28moogles> yeah
[1:10:44] <%castlerock42> We all came to that conclusion.
[1:10:44] <Blank9> yep
[1:10:44] <%Rumbutt> yep
[1:10:44] <+kewlmyc> it's good with mods. New Vegas is better in every way
[1:10:44] <Consumanist> that's fair
[1:10:45] <%MidnightBurst12> ye
[1:10:46] <%AmericanSkidd> Agreed
[1:10:47] <%Wulfphelz> Yup
[1:10:47] <teefpal> same
[1:10:48] <dekkitout> Like many Bethesda games
[1:10:49] <+mixmastermoody> Mass effect is closer to gears than fallout
[1:10:49] <+senfood> Crazy accurate.
[1:10:49] <AngryAsian5> Liberty Prime is dope LUL
[1:10:50] <Nightwolf656> Fun game does not = good game
[1:10:50] <Reveresao> NV > 4 <  3
[1:10:50] <%SovPho> Fallout 3 is like Minecraft and New Vegas. It's a really good template, but you should mod the shit out of it to get a decent game out of it.
[1:10:50] <%deviljhojho_> i was like "lol this sucks" after like 3 days
[1:10:51] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> dumb fun
[1:10:51] <%KeiganOfAstora> lol
[1:10:51] <Gorshum> Yup
[1:10:53] <%Agami23> sorta
[1:10:54] <%baka_sugoi> yeah that happens
[1:10:54] <%AncelDeLambert> oh wait, I'm wasting my time
[1:10:55] <+vaderxyz1970> yah
[1:10:55] <%DrTomT18> I mean New Vegas is better in every way
[1:10:56] <%MrMegaJackpots> that was me with Skyrim
[1:10:57] <%RealThiele> that can happen with games
[1:10:57] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> I dropped Fallout 3 after 30 minutes.
[1:10:58] <%JoshManVGH> Never gone back to it
[1:10:58] <%jillyrancher> I think Fallout 3 is fun but super flawed
[1:10:58] <Consumanist> I played new vegas before 3
[1:10:58] <@Lion_kun> Fallout 2 is the best one
[1:10:58] <%peachy996> If you heal a Vorcha they joyously shout "I'm ALIVE!" in the MP
[1:10:59] <%Agami23> new vegas made me realize it sucked
[1:10:59] <Sp3ctre48> I made that decision with Skyrim in about 800 hours
[1:11:00] <stantheman_97> 3 is good but the main story sucks ass
[1:11:00] <@ssjklyco> Good game and fun game aren't always the same
[1:11:00] <tukds> i just got here an hour in did he start yet?
[1:11:01] <%count_bob> I did that with Fallout 4
[1:11:02] <%athuramn> yup
[1:11:03] <chainsaw105> I refuse to watch the ManyATrueNerd "Fallout 3 is Better Than You Think" video
[1:11:04] <%KeiganOfAstora> The last DLC helped tho
[1:11:05] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> it's like trash TV
[1:11:05] <+Beetlewins> I mean you can enjoy games
[1:11:06] <secret_npc> me with botw at 50 hours
[1:11:07] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt I vividly remember trying to swing a melee weapon and almost vomiting
[1:11:08] <%RealThiele> suck cost is a bitch
[1:11:09] <%peachy996> It's oddly adorable
[1:11:10] <%SveriSageAdvice> happened to me with Skyrim every time i tried to play it legit, supplemented all my fun with mods
[1:11:13] <+vaderxyz1970> Rock-it launcher was the best for me
[1:11:14] <%toolofparanoia> need ME3 multiplayer to come back with my turians with jetpacks so i can use SW sequel memes. "THEY FLY NOW? THEY FLY NOW."
[1:11:14] <%ahomeschooldropout> did that after 2000 hours of siege
[1:11:17] <@Lion_kun> 2>1>NV>3
[1:11:18] <DianaTheAscian> like sucks ass or just really meh?
[1:11:21] <teefpal> Also omg pat read my message!!!!! :)
[1:11:23] <%Ghufufin> best description is FO 3 is great if u ignore the story and just wander around
[1:11:25] <%Rikufmix21> happened with 4
[1:11:27] <$Futurecity10> @PatStaresAt When are you going to fucking finish zeta
[1:11:27] <dekkitout> Ironically, I've been sold on teh premise that Fallout 76 is a solid fallout themed playground
[1:11:28] <%peachy996> Download it!
[1:11:29] <+Beetlewins> Fallout 3 was fine until New Vegas came out and showed how it could be done
[1:11:29] <%Blackleafx> fallout 3 is garbage and here's why
[1:11:32] <%Theycallmenerf> I just started Fallout 4 on survival for the first time and I hate that I enjoy it way more than vanilla Fallout 4.
[1:11:32] <%RealThiele> some time alter. . .
[1:11:33] <%deviljhojho_> its just the new deviants patch i think
[1:11:33] <kingmemelord97> Nope not really I preferred 3 and 4 over. New Vegas
[1:11:34] <%peachy996> Let's talk about that
[1:11:35] <PerfectPepperPlantPro> Whoo an hour late and I didnt miss anything! I love this
[1:11:36] <@Lion_kun> Never played 4
[1:11:36] <%Treasure_Vault> At least you figure it out after 99 hours, instead of on the second world like The Outer Worlds
[1:11:36] <%deviljhojho_> and the kulve fight
[1:11:38] <%Wulfphelz> Without FO3 we wouldn’t have FoNV so it’s okay tomatoSmile
[1:11:38] <rytisone> quick fix
[1:11:38] <%JamesCorck> Fuck yeah I didn't miss it!
[1:11:39] <%AmericanSkidd> There are a bunch of bad games I enjoy
[1:11:40] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt How far have you gotten into Stories 2 since you stopped streaming it?
[1:11:41] <zhenthrim213> Just wing it
[1:11:41] <Dunmarkh> well fallout 3 is inferior to new vegas because tale of 2 wastelands exists
[1:11:41] <TheAntiNihilist> not really. for me it got better and better as I explored
[1:11:46] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Stream Sparks
[1:11:46] <%RealThiele> LUL
[1:11:47] <+every_loyal_son> Nope
[1:11:50] <%DrTomT18> Did you read cyberpunks patch notes?
[1:11:52] <chainsaw105> flashbang
[1:11:52] <%SaiyanShoto> Brachidios kinship is the best kinship
[1:11:53] <@QueequegTheater> Fallout 4 on Survival is just Lone Survivor Build: The Game
[1:11:53] <bob900000> as someone who hasn't played a Fallout game what makes new vegas the best
[1:11:53] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Is fallout 3 the one with the dumb end?
[1:12:00] <%NopeBadguy> Bring it back then!
[1:12:01] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Like the really dumb end
[1:12:02] <%DrTomT18> @SuckerPunchSyd Yes
[1:12:03] <teefpal> Why did you stop streaming it?
[1:12:03] <artoflec> Pat did you see Kiryu in Monkey Ball
[1:12:04] <%deviljhojho_> it gets REAL wacky in the post game
[1:12:05] <%RealThiele> Cyberpunk has just given up on everything
[1:12:05] <%NopeBadguy> Those streams kicked ass!
[1:12:07] <%YakumoYomi> I kinda fell off Stories 2 as well
[1:12:07] <DianaTheAscian> its should be a requirement to put patch notes
[1:12:07] <Consumanist> hopefully the patch fixes my brokem relationship  with  Samara
[1:12:08] <+every_loyal_son> Pat note
[1:12:14] <blackjack8182> Fallout 3 walked so Fallout NV could run
[1:12:17] <teefpal> Was it because it was a bad game?
[1:12:17] <%toolofparanoia> :<
[1:12:18] <@QueequegTheater> WE'RE BRINGING IT BACK
[1:12:18] <%JoshManVGH> @suckerpunchsyd Unless you get DLC, yeah
[1:12:20] <%SuckerPunchSyd> @drtomt18 god good
[1:12:22] <%DEETRz> what was the reason you stopped again?
[1:12:27] <%MoguManda> less than zero
[1:12:29] <%peachy996> Do it.
[1:12:29] <%deviljhojho_> DONT CALL IT A COMEBACK
[1:12:30] <28moogles> Nier Replicant any day guys

[1:12:37] <zhenthrim213> so your saying theres a chance
[1:12:39] <%Sotetsu> Thanks for getting me back into Endless Space 2.
[1:12:41] <%Rikufmix21> new vegas
[1:12:42] <+senfood> The only exception was Disco Elysium.
[1:12:42] <secret_npc> Pat when is Daemon X Machina coming back?
[1:12:42] <+vaderxyz1970> It was a very good stream game
[1:12:47] <kingmemelord97> New Vegas is alright but I wouldn’t say it’s the best fallout
[1:12:48] <%NopeBadguy> Those Stories 2 streams kicked ass tho...
[1:12:50] <%Wulfphelz> Persona FeelsBadMan
[1:12:51] <%Blackleafx> you said that about disco elysium

[1:28:31] <Consumanist> Shepherd looks like dad
[1:28:39] <%DrTomT18> I love Garrus so much
[1:28:39] <Vantesla> only downside is each chain is less damage by half, but sets up multiple tech explosions.
[1:28:40] <dekkitout> Of all things, nepotism is a no no to Turrians?
[1:28:42] <%RealThiele> Nepotism is bad?!?!? whaaaa?
[1:28:43] <%tusk102> shepard looks like my uncle
[1:28:43] <rytisone> you mean friends?
[1:28:46] <zhenthrim213> get the jump ON REAPERS
[1:28:47] <%jillyrancher> Cortez rules
[1:28:51] <%ComfortableStranger> @jillyrancher not as good as other powers like warp, reave, etc
[1:28:54] <@QueequegTheater> @dekkitout Their military is a hard meritocracy
[1:28:55] <luftraumm1> if an ai creates itself a body based on humans,  why doesn't it wear clothes
[1:28:56] <Profmcstevie> Garrus cover my butt, EDI cover my penis. LETS MOVE
[1:28:58] <secret_npc> Shepard just wants his banana hoard back
[1:29:03] <%Rikufmix21> turians say FUCK nepotism
[1:29:05] <$lotharrio> Cutscene guns. Everyone can use them. They are deadly?
[1:29:06] <%DrTomT18> for some reason it always defaults to the M9
[1:29:06] <%TheHateFish> Cutscene guns
[1:29:07] <Kratosirving1987> default always seems to be the Avenger assault rifle for w/e reason :|
[1:29:08] <rReizs> could you imagine jumping off the dropship the wrong way and instantly breaking your ankle
[1:29:09] <%DrTomT18> sorry, M8
[1:29:10] <+NeonLight> Shepard just talking to his fingers all Shining like
[1:29:11] <%tusk102> @dekkitout they are all based on military skill. giving someone with no skill a high rank is of course hated
[1:29:21] <%jillyrancher> @comfortablestranger I dont think warp does anything to shields in 3, it does in 2 though
[1:29:22] <dekkitout> @QueequegTheater You sayin merits can't be inherited Kappa
[1:29:29] <%tusk102> the m7 avenger is busted
[1:29:38] <%ComfortableStranger> yall ready to fight some DRAGONS?
[1:29:38] <%jillyrancher> tired shepard
[1:29:39] <%ironohki> Good thing these three people are powerful enough to fix the thing.
[1:29:40] <%Ravioli_Ronin> “Git gud”
[1:29:40] <%RealThiele> Cortez, pick us up and put us over there
[1:29:41] <Sp3ctre48> Why is everyone so bad at fighting Reapers it's easy
[1:29:41] <%kekkerscrew> Away with you devil mouse
[1:29:41] <Consumanist> Why are Shepard's fingers talking to him in distress
[1:29:42] <%peachy996> This mission is both cool and OH MAN
[1:29:43] <+fetrigon> UNGA
[1:29:45] <%tusk102> m7 lancer i mean
[1:29:46] <%Dakuu75> imagine if shepards respons to "My men are dying!" was, "Your men should get good."
[1:29:53] <@QueequegTheater> KBM is worse than controller in all situations
[1:29:54] <%ComfortableStranger> @jillyrancher talking about barriers
[1:30:01] <cpt_langosta> why does edi look like kamina?
[1:30:02] <TourettesPlays> Fuckin love that EDI has the HOLODUKE LUL LUL LUL

[1:30:27] <%jillyrancher> @comfortablestranger I was too, sorry I typed shields instead of barriers, but I meant barriers
[1:30:28] <Vantesla> @tusk102 mind it should be given it's supposed to be a late game addition. Also give fans of original heatsink some fun SeemsGood
[1:30:30] <nesbitt22> Pat what happened to Blood Dragon armorr?
[1:30:31] <%ComfortableStranger> 10 bucks says Pat still doesn't roll cancel nova for i-frames

[1:30:36] <$lotharrio> Probably more war crimes
[1:30:37] <TourettesPlays> @trackles_64 she's a more boring mordin
[1:30:42] <%DrTomT18> that's one way of looking at it
[1:30:48] <@QueequegTheater> @Shockmaster182 fine, just a bit iffy on selecting things
[1:30:49] <luftraumm1> Edi, put some clothes on for the love of God
[1:30:49] <%YakumoYomi> Aaagain... Kappa

[1:34:37] <Consumanist> the kid is guilty by proxy
[1:34:41] <%tusk102> its a turian assault rifle, not great @PatStaresAt

[1:34:45] <Kratosirving1987> my Insanity playthrough cause masochism!
[1:34:47] <Sp3ctre48> Most assault rifles get power crept by the Typhoon tbh

[1:34:49] <+vaderxyz1970> This level is just throwing upgrades at you
[1:34:52] <Profmcstevie> "Maybe next time" he lied smiling
[1:34:53] <$ainzhelm> It’s what the marauders use

[1:35:07] <%afronooch> i hated this mission on insanity

[1:35:30] <%Alig200> lmao, he wasn't even done calling out its arrival before it was dead
[1:35:30] <%peachy996> Garrus melts this on Hardcore and you put it on Normal lol
[1:35:30] <%DrTomT18> @Sp3ctre48 dude, spoilers, shush
[1:35:33] <cooldude69xx> Garrus is just calling his shots
[1:35:33] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Apparently in the Pokemon Legends Nuzlocke the player can also die
[1:35:34] <cpt_langosta> I was looking at chat, did garrus melt the miniboss again?
[1:35:36] <Consumanist> I'm enjoying a treat Garrus!!
[1:35:38] <%Retinolgaming> Garrus has become the protagonist

[1:35:46] <%RealThiele> what boss?
[1:35:49] <28moogles> lmao this is gonna be boring to watch
[1:35:50] <%bread_assassin> Pat just turned it down, so Garrus can shine.
[1:35:53] <%DrTomT18> Pat, Shockwave is good.
[1:35:57] <DXLelouch24> this is why i will laugh at those that play normal after their first run, its laughably easy. So much id get bored.
[1:35:58] <secret_npc> You should respec and do Cryo ammo instead
[1:36:00] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> How does it fell to be a side character Pat?
[1:36:04] <Vantesla> Wish ME Legendary Edition did more for NG+ players. Add some additional fun stuff. Mind my biggest gripe is ME2 terrible NG+ if porting to ME3 ever...

[1:36:22] <Minorou> Do I read? Of course I'm literate
[1:36:25] <%peachy996> It could mean more missions being done now that PAt isn't dying like a goofball
[1:36:25] <%Wulfphelz> Garrus rolls off the tongue nicely 🥴
[1:36:26] <cpt_langosta> "Shepard here. No, I can't read. Over."

[1:37:31] <%maenos2> probably a satellite dish
[1:37:32] <Vantesla> ME2 NG+ not carrying weapon upgrades and other stuff vs the original or ME3 was a oversight EA could had fixed in Legendary. Well the helmet issue as well. Without PC mods I mean LUL
[1:37:32] <Profmcstevie> Or maybe it's a weapon LUL
[1:37:35] <%Ipsenscastle> 40000 people used to live in this city

[1:38:14] <TourettesPlays> Marauder Shields NOOOOOOOOOOOO
[1:38:16] <%jillyrancher> Pat just not gonna shoot ar all
[1:38:17] <%toolofparanoia> Incoming harvesters. Garrus: "Fools."
[1:38:20] <dekkitout> "Wait- I'm a Turrian..."
[1:38:20] <%JoshManVGH> Garrus how could you fail me like this
[1:38:29] <Giztech> ha the rebar was through your face
[1:38:31] <@Ranryu692> I think my first death was in this room
[1:38:31] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> Turn on your ammo Pat.
[1:38:40] <%Treasure_Vault> edi your dummy thicc ass keeps alerting the guards
[1:38:44] <%ComfortableStranger> if only you had a button to direct squadmates PAT!
[1:38:45] <%RealThiele> not charging enough clearly
[1:38:46] <+OneGorillionDollars> Hearing garrus in the background goind BRRRRT like an A-10 is fucking hilarious
[1:38:51] <%jillyrancher> pat activate your ammo
[1:38:51] <Vantesla> Isn't there a button to focus fire LUL
[1:39:00] <TourettesPlays> Squadmate AI poo

[1:39:07] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> I hate how much I love EDIs thiccness
[1:39:12] <falyden> the sound of death
[1:39:13] <%TheotherKristian> Man, it must be frustrating how enjoyable 98% of Mass Effect 3 is
[1:39:15] <%ComfortableStranger> LOL
[1:39:17] <Vantesla> I can believe it as the AI is derp derp.
[1:39:19] <WDxDracor> they dont always follow the prompts
[1:39:20] <+Chaos_Aether> were you
[1:39:21] <$lotharrio> Ammo power, Pat?
[1:39:23] <%toolofparanoia> Garrus: TARGET ACQUI- TARGET DESTROYED!
[1:39:23] <Goatllama> finally his voice is breaking
[1:39:32] <Profmcstevie> His voice is going high, HE'S LYIN
[1:39:37] <tinytinykittycat> sometimes the harvester health bars dont show up until youre on top of them
[1:39:38] <cpt_langosta> yep its dumb
[1:39:44] <%jillyrancher> Slap Edi's giant robot butt cheeks
[1:39:49] <Vantesla> No never activated in mission
[1:39:50] <Consumanist> Let's not escalate the race war
[1:39:53] <Kratosirving1987> anytime you change something in the Weapon loadout screen it likes to turn off ammo powers
[1:39:55] <%AmericanSkidd> @TheotherKristian no, its frustrating how bad 2% is
[1:39:57] <secret_npc> If you change weapons your ammo power resets
[1:39:59] <%Wurmspawn> The Ammo power only applies to the gun you have at the time you deploy it. If you switch guns at all you need to apply it to the new gun.
[1:39:59] <+GuilKato> cause you opened the weapon selection page at a guess
[1:40:06] <cpt_langosta> cutscene despawned ammo power?
[1:40:06] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @theotherkristian dude, it's the worst cause you're on the best ride ever, and then your mom kicks you in the balls, spits on you, and leaves you stranded
[1:40:06] <%RealThiele> EDI needs a backup sound with that dump truck
[1:40:08] <Kratosirving1987> so when you looked at the assault rifle from earlier, i think it turned back off
[1:40:09] <teefpal> Damn chat is falling hard for that robocake
[1:40:24] <godila2> it turned off after you look at new weapon in menu
[1:40:26] <QuestlordJake> garrus do the thing
[1:40:31] <%peachy996> Garrus can afford to be lazy now
[1:40:37] <+unhuggable1> garrus ammp power
[1:40:38] <%peachy996> Also this is an ME1 battle theme
[1:40:39] <%RealThiele> oh hes doin it
[1:40:42] <%JoshManVGH> Fucking bodied
[1:40:50] <cpt_langosta> So anyway, I started charging...
[1:40:51] <%peachy996> This is from Ilos
[1:41:00] <chainsaw105> has he been hit by the Brute insta-kill yet?
[1:41:01] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> I feel like EDIs ass has a gravitation pull
[1:41:06] <%toolofparanoia> GET THE BLACKSTAR
[1:41:08] <Vantesla> AI going I'm going to walk and run around like a chicken with it's head cut off LUL
[1:41:13] <%RealThiele> Brutes die before they get to do much
[1:41:14] <$lotharrio> Well if the Reapers did one good thing... it's nearly killing all of those ffffffffFFFUCKING BATARIANS.
[1:41:19] <secret_npc> As long as you're having fun, Pat
[1:41:24] <rReizs> oh man all the different styles of vanguard in MP

[1:41:31] <%toolofparanoia> WEAPON ON RIGHT
[1:41:31] <kjb343> ABC = always be charging
[1:41:32] <Brandon__Brando> that ability must of been hell to not bug out
[1:41:32] <%Jeemukun> it's probably been mentioned before, but James can use the same gun that Garrus has right now, makes for a fun party with those two

[2:19:22] <PaperyHornet1013> Why did you guys tell pat how to break the game
[2:19:23] <teefpal> "Because I'm a fascist, Shepard.  This should have been obvious"
[2:19:25] <%NopeBadguy> @patstaresat because they're both military
[2:19:26] <%Ravioli_Ronin> Big “no we HAD to drop the atomic bomb” energy
[2:19:27] <+Qexec> The Krogan were flinging asteroids at planets.
[2:19:27] <JoshyJay> yeah Shepard would never try to wipe out any-
[2:19:30] <+Soliloquy123> the krogan were literally a galactic threat at the time
[2:19:32] <stantheman_97> but they're right the krogan's were planning on genociding everyone
[2:19:39] <+vaderxyz1970> Yah Fck Cristopher Columbus
[2:19:41] <$SGrim> Pat, 750 years is like 3 turian generations. Garrus is defending his grandfather.

[2:19:49] <+Extrallent> Pat the Kogan dropped asteroids on planets.

[2:20:13] <AxelCezar> The asteroids thingy was really compeling
[2:20:14] <stantheman_97> that's like saying "no we can't wipe the reapers that's genocide"
[2:20:14] <Pookiedaexzile> They had their speices erased
[2:20:19] <%ironohki> "Yeah, we're bad, but they're worse." - literally every war.
[2:20:19] <chainsaw105> "Did your Elder shoot my grampa?"

[2:20:25] <+fetrigon> LUL
[2:20:37] <%jillyrancher> I'm more angry at the Turians for not bothering to remove the bomb for like 700 years than putting it there immediately after the war.

[2:20:39] <%xcompleasedad> BoMb
[2:20:39] <secret_npc> fr judge the Turians and Salarians all you want, nobody were bigger monsters than the Krogan

[2:27:05] <Ner234> RIP
[2:27:06] <ape_hawk> rip
[2:27:07] <+GuilKato> who could ahve saved him
[2:27:07] <Holofono> F BibleThump
[2:27:08] <@ssjklyco> No body no death
[2:27:09] <%Treasure_Vault> Shoulda brought a jetpack
[2:27:09] <Sp3ctre48> That cutscene looks so funny
[2:27:10] <%HaroldDonchee> badass tho
[2:27:12] <%Deft_Thought> Where's your grappling hook, idiot
[2:27:12] <QuestlordJake> I think he could've pushed off with his legs but alright
[2:27:13] <%xcompleasedad> He DOUBLE dead
[2:27:13] <SmigGames> go save him!
[2:27:14] <rudiciuscaesar> RIP
[2:27:14] <Gorshum> We can rebuild him, we have the technology.
[2:27:15] <Parapattern> Could've used a jetpack
[2:27:16] <secret_npc> That was good
[2:27:16] <Xiangchang> Just walk it off
[2:27:16] <choocheess> that doesn't make sense if youre a biotic
[2:27:19] <%InternetShis> Why did it explode
[2:27:20] <Zeif00> NotLikeThis
[2:27:20] <%Garthunox> Today IS a good day to die
[2:27:20] <perfectharbinger> I'm glad I came just in time for one of the most ridiculous deaths in the trilogy lol.
[2:27:21] <cpt_langosta> the bomb core looked like a honeydew
[2:27:21] <@Ranryu692> if only someone had superpowers that could make people float
[2:27:22] <teefpal> That was actually pretty cool
[2:27:22] <Pookiedaexzile> He coulda did a Flip
[2:27:23] <ThatGuyThere03> If only you knew telekinesis
[2:27:24] <%DrTomT18> could shepard have pulled him to safety with Biotics?
[2:27:25] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> He needed a loyalty misson
[2:27:25] <$lotharrio> Man, too bad no one had mind powers that can make people float.
[2:27:26] <SaltyAzteca> Redemption BibleThump 7
[2:27:26] <%Treasure_Vault> It's the future, you need a jetpack 95% of the time
[2:27:26] <Madinki> F in the chat for the bird man
[2:27:26] <AxelCezar> well, either that or everyone, so easy choice
[2:27:30] <%peachy996> Maybe if he set it to Normal, he'd still be alive
[2:27:30] <%InternetShis> If it explodes, that's bad for a bomb
[2:27:33] <%gliph13> lived a failure, died a GODAMN HERO!
[2:27:37] <stantheman_97> just slap some medi-gel on him he'll be fine
[2:27:37] <secret_npc> If you have Liara on your team she catches him
[2:27:40] <SmigGames> Miranda can put him back together
[2:27:41] <%AzureGale> BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump
[2:27:43] <@Ranryu692> @InternetShis I think that was just the detonator, not the bomb itself
[2:27:44] <+fetrigon> meh
[2:27:45] <%Deft_Thought> Or the Biotic teammate who could psionically lift the dude up
[2:27:45] <Pookiedaexzile> If only you spec'd into a skill called Pull
[2:27:51] <Pookiedaexzile> If only
[2:27:55] <%DrTomT18> @secret_npc Seriously?
[2:27:55] <TourettesPlays> Joker you crack wise about that Turian's dead son and you do it RIGHT NOW
[2:27:57] <choocheess> @secret_npc are you fucking serious
[2:27:57] <+alphonseisbest> didn't die like abitch
[2:27:58] <mr_saturday93> liara doesn't catch him...
[2:27:58] <%xcompleasedad> @secret_npc SHUT UP. No way!
[2:27:59] <Pookiedaexzile> Only you could teleport
[2:28:00] <cpt_langosta> good to see this cutscene actually work, unlike in the ps3 version
[2:28:08] <PaperyHornet1013> pat please turn the difficulty up or change their guns please
[2:28:09] <%peachy996> Even in the bedroom?
[2:28:12] <%aWanderingKaivo> @DrTomT18 that is not true
[2:28:19] <secret_npc> 😀
[2:28:19] <%AmericanSkidd> lies
[2:28:24] <dekkitout> @TourettesPlays I know you got one up your sleeve, Joker
[2:28:24] <Latija> he just saved the krogan and they're like ohhh he saved us i guess
[2:28:27] <cpt_langosta> sometimes shep just isn't there
[2:28:31] <+vaderxyz1970> But its you own fault for the bomb in the first place
[2:28:33] <Madinki> @PaperyHornet1013 No MELT EVERYTHING
[2:28:34] <ErikFeral> Society Saved
[2:28:39] <Pookiedaexzile> Krogan's Deserve a bomb
[2:28:41] <Dunmarkh> @PaperyHornet1013 putting the difficulty to max won't slow down garrus
[2:28:44] <perfectharbinger> Yeah, Shep's model glitches out in that cutscene.
[2:28:45] <choocheess> Hacket should be saying good work melting that mech Garrus
[2:28:46] <%joodatious> the characters talk alot more about whats actually happening alot more in this then in 2 where they only talked about their personal stuff
[2:28:46] <%Treasure_Vault> Make them kiss
[2:28:52] <AngryAsian5> Wittle babby fight
[2:28:58] <WDxDracor> Turians are putting more bombs everywhere
[2:28:58] <TourettesPlays> Why is every multiplat from that gen so terrible on PS3. Weird ass system architecture?
[2:29:02] <%MidnightBurst12> MY QUAD
[2:29:04] <%Ravioli_Ronin> Slappin’ quads
[2:29:08] <perfectharbinger> There's a cutscene later on where you get a similar issue. It
[2:29:14] <Sp3ctre48> Wrex your people dropped asteroids on their planet
[2:29:16] <Pookiedaexzile> Slap eachother nippos> 100,000s Dead
[2:29:19] <+GuilKato> it was  good tactical decision
[2:29:25] <%joodatious> wrex didnt say to get over it tho
[2:29:27] <secret_npc> I'm Commander Shepard, and this is my favorite I should go bang, okay? Wrex.
[2:29:29] <Pookiedaexzile> They started it
[2:29:31] <%kujofire990> WERE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER
[2:29:32] <mr_saturday93> duh fuck pat....
[2:29:35] <%AzureGale> HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT
[2:29:35] <dekkitout> Wrex
[2:29:36] <%Ravioli_Ronin> MAKE ‘EM SMOOCH
[2:29:39] <stantheman_97> based shepard
[2:29:42] <secret_npc> *makes the scared face*
[2:29:46] <Ardailec> @TourettesPlays Pretty much. The PS3 was in this weird space of being the highest powered, yet the most difficult to work with dev side
[2:29:48] <+butterick> Shepherd.
[2:29:51] <%joodatious> thank you everyone for being smart
[2:29:52] <%Wurmspawn> Now... kisssssss....

[2:30:08] <%hrbeck_> BUT I WILL KILL THIS BIRDTHING AFTER THIS IS OVER
[2:30:08] <+butterick> pupperHEAT
[2:30:09] <MiamiMemory> Turians don't have lips
[2:30:14] <%Deft_Thought> Yeah, the past isn't important! Eugenics and racism don't matter cuz there's big bad guys we gotta blow up!
[2:30:17] <mr_saturday93> Angry shep!
[2:30:19] <+vaderxyz1970> He seems real beat up about his son
[2:30:20] <teefpal> Wow shep sounded like a total ass
[2:30:24] <%echobee_tv> That didn't sound very Paragon
[2:30:24] <%Quigsies> war is dirty
[2:30:25] <kjb343> ouch
[2:30:26] <%DrTomT18> It was never finished
[2:30:26] <%afronooch> cause war
[2:30:29] <%akscully> need an air filter in here
[2:30:30] <+alphonseisbest> looks cool
[2:30:30] <choocheess> cuz war, war never changes
[2:30:30] <%AmericanSkidd> I feel bad for Victus here
[2:30:31] <%The_Protagonist> dirty war
[2:30:31] <$lotharrio> People keep farting in there. Fear farts.
[2:30:31] <Ardailec> Because ME3 had to be edgy
[2:30:32] <%valriot> Shepard goo everywhere
[2:30:32] <Pookiedaexzile> War is never clean
[2:30:32] <%Rumbutt> BECAUSE WAR IS FILTHY PAT, GET IT
[2:30:32] <stantheman_97> war
[2:30:33] <brexdq> cuz war is stinky
[2:30:33] <akitanito> because wrex and victus is just shitting all over the place
[2:30:34] <teefpal> Sure he did
[2:30:34] <perfectharbinger> I really like the dialogue you get with Liara after this mission.
[2:30:35] <%chill_o_wisp> because war is dirty
[2:30:36] <zhenthrim213> no one wants to clean it
[2:30:37] <secret_npc> When Microsoft Game Studios helped make the first game, they embedded an anti-PS3 virus into the code, which of course was used in the sequels
[2:30:38] <%gliph13> cause it was literally strapped on last minute
[2:30:40] <TourettesPlays> @Ardailec good that all the best games got ported to PS4 then. Except the R&C and Resistance games
[2:30:41] <%Romuken> you ever tried washing a war asset?  It's a bitch.  Let it be dirty.
[2:30:42] <%AzureGale> "My son is a bitch ass motherfucker"
[2:30:43] <Madinki> BECAUSE WAR AIN'T CLEAN PAT
[2:30:48] <WDxDracor> his men are dead LUL

[2:30:54] <$TallYoda08> sipsipDab sipsipDab sipsipDab
[2:30:56] <%jillyrancher> It's a little disapponting to see Pat use the Typhon on Garrus who kills everything, when ME3 combat is really fun to engage with
[2:30:58] <+vaderxyz1970> janitorial cant get the security clearance to get in
[2:31:01] <yeildingthought> It’s all the construction dust
[2:31:03] <choocheess> war is the first time I ever heard of trench foot, that's pretty dirty
[2:31:05] <secret_npc> Internet
[2:31:05] <$lotharrio> Internet!
[2:31:06] <teefpal> He was a fucking loser, but he also sacrificed his life for the good of everyone so it evens out
[2:31:06] <%DrTomT18> If you don't do that mission, it fucks you HARD
[2:31:07] <%Nobrev> kaboom boolets

[2:31:11] <%AzureGale> I am sad that there is no mission complete screen for ME3 :(

[2:32:37] <%peachy996> Oh I just enjoy giving Pat shit either way. If I really wanted it, I'd be playing it myself

[2:32:59] <+alphonseisbest> remember Pat did cheat all the monies in at the start
[2:33:04] <@ssjklyco> He's not saying Shepard anyore
[2:33:10] <%jillyrancher> I just want Pat to have fun with the combat cause it's really solid
[2:33:12] <teefpal> Thats why this room exists?
[2:33:12] <%DrTomT18> Also you need loading screen banter
[2:33:16] <%TheotherKristian> Justifications for the loading screen doors
[2:33:17] <Latija> no mimics are getting through the xray machine
[2:33:18] <%trackles_64> But how does a gate stop collectors?
[2:33:19] <$lotharrio> The extra load screen will keep you safe
[2:33:21] <Dunmarkh> he is a brave corpse
[2:33:31] <%peachy996> Yeah I also appreciate it on a hallway not near the hull of the ship
[2:33:31] <%trackles_64> Traynor fangirling
[2:33:41] <+vaderxyz1970> They are less than rent a cops
[2:33:42] <cpt_langosta> he died as he lived: falling off of illegal bombs.
[2:33:46] <akitanito> I don't think that armor will help
[2:33:47] <zhenthrim213> and helmets
[2:33:48] <dekkitout> Yeoman, I am many things. Self sacrificial is not one of them
[2:33:48] <%Deft_Thought> You're so heroic! I would also go and try and disarm a bomb!
[2:33:52] <%Ipsenscastle> Traynor is nice

[2:36:55] <%InternetShis> @vaderxyz1970 The VI on the moon in ME1 that went rogue
[2:36:57] <%xcompleasedad> Fucking sex-bot data vs Quark kinda shit
[2:37:17] <%peachy996> @NocturneNovember I think my favorite bit is Eddie Murphy being told off by Bill Cosby about his racy language. And then Richard Pryor chimes in with what is basically "man fuck cosby"
[2:37:21] <%jillyrancher> spoilers
[2:37:28] <Nightwolf656> I need feedback please, does anyone else see the Turians as giant grasshoppers?
[2:37:39] <%jillyrancher> I cant wait for Cosby to croak
[2:37:45] <Sp3ctre48> Everyone in the game already wants to fuck Shepard, let Joker have his robot gf

[2:37:54] <stantheman_97> @nightwolf656 shit i can kinda see it
[2:37:56] <cpt_langosta> @Nightwolf656 yes, i can sorta see it

[2:37:59] <%jillyrancher> legit monster lol
[2:38:00] <hat_under_bread> @peachy996 No, but I see where you're coming from.
[2:38:09] <Nightwolf656> THANK YOU
[2:38:11] <%Ravioli_Ronin> @nightwolf656 people keep saying they’re avian, but they really feel more bug-like tbh
[2:38:23] <%peachy996> Can't watch the cosby show ever again
[2:38:27] <%jillyrancher> not really Nightwolf
[2:38:31] <sirrice77> @Sp3ctre48 No no you have to let the player have the chance to romance anyone they want or else
[2:38:46] <%peachy996> Then again that show has aged horribly anyway
[2:38:50] <Nightwolf656> I always hear the bird comparison and i'm like i see it but...have you looked at Bugs
[2:38:52] <Vantesla> @ipsenscastle A racist got upset a white woman had a cookbook about noodles and dumplings. The racist saying it was cultural appropriation and other stupid crap while focusing on the others race. The racist was blasted by everyone pretty much so she went to protected. Even her followers dogged on her and she kept doubling down calling everyone a Nazi....
[2:38:53] <cpt_langosta> tbh, turians stand out to me among mass effect races because they don't immediately remind me of anything familiar, barring their humanoid proportions. good design.
[2:38:55] <%peachy996> It was pretty dorky
[2:39:04] <%peachy996> The wife was cool
[2:39:09] <%jillyrancher> Tali can fuck off she'll never get Garrus corkscrew dick while I'm around
[2:39:16] <sirrice77> @Ipsenscastle I assume it's because on twitter people make a big deal out of nothing

[2:42:07] <%jillyrancher> @nightwolf656 One of the artists said that's what Turians had

[2:42:29] <Nightwolf656> FUCK...that's just the worst
[2:42:29] <perfectharbinger> That artist needs to be shot xD
[2:42:30] <%kyh9> I do wonder if the Krogans will be rebelling and fucking shit up again in ME4
[2:42:31] <%jillyrancher> same guy who said they have cloacas
[2:42:47] <%peachy996> What do turians have?
[2:42:47] <Nightwolf656> -_-
[2:42:53] <%kyh9> Like, when Wrex dies, what's going to stop them from just going ham again.
[2:42:55] <perfectharbinger> @kyh9 I'd certainly hope not.
[2:43:02] <NetherTable> woo cloacas, we in it now
[2:43:05] <%peachy996> Oh you guys are talking about the junk
[2:43:06] <%jillyrancher> turians have cloacas and duck penises
[2:43:07] <countyarc216> Is ME4 confirmed?
[2:43:12] <%jillyrancher> ye
[2:43:15] <Sp3ctre48> yeah
[2:43:15] <perfectharbinger> Yes.
[2:43:25] <NetherTable> aye
[2:43:25] <%peachy996> If e621 says blue peens who am I to disagree with dedicated hornballs?
[2:43:30] <Profmcstevie> Is anything confirmed till it's in your hands, really
[2:43:31] <%Ravioli_Ronin> Yeah andromeda’s out right now DarkMode
[2:43:34] <perfectharbinger> Though literally all we know about it is that Liara's in it and it's a sequel to ME3 lol.
[2:43:38] <Nightwolf656> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[2:43:39] <perfectharbinger> Oh and also snow.
[2:44:04] <%Ravioli_Ronin> Mass effect 4: lightning returns 2
[2:44:08] <%peachy996> There is concept art you could glean from ME4 but best not to
[2:44:08] <%jillyrancher> another Krogan rebellion sounds like the worst plot idea ever imo
[2:44:15] <%kyh9> @kyh9 Like, we see that if Wrex is dead in ME3, that his replacement is WAY more interested in going hard against the council races. Wrex and Eve are the only entities willing to keep the entire race of Krogans (which will be 1000X larger after the genophage is removed) from pushing other species off their planets
[2:44:21] <Sp3ctre48> @kyh9 Hope Wrex is enough to culturally change the Krogan before he dies, which is silly but Bioware really wants you to cure the genophage so it'll probably be fine
[2:44:27] <Nightwolf656> Ugh the worst bit of this info for me is i'm sure i found out about this when it was told/reported and i mentally bleached my brain of the info
[2:44:27] <%SaphronBlackbourne> I was expecting ME to be put on hold longer after Andromeda
[2:44:31] <perfectharbinger> I'd just generally hate the idea of ME4 being about some civil war in general.
[2:44:40] <%peachy996> Just give me another Salarian squadmate far removed from Mordin and technically Kallo
[2:44:41] <%AmericanSkidd> Mass Effect 4: The Search for Spock
[2:44:49] <perfectharbinger> Because the theme of ME3 is literally "Galactic unity in the face of the worst shit ever to happen in the history of ever"
[2:44:57] <%peachy996> Give me a grizzled jaded asshole of a Salarian
[2:44:57] <Profmcstevie> The only enemy left for a ME4 is ourselves, CIVIL WAR it shall be!
[2:44:59] <perfectharbinger> Making ME4 about infighting is ridiculous.
[2:45:11] <%jillyrancher> let us be some Shadow Broker agent working for Liara
[2:45:24] <Sp3ctre48> I don't know what else you can do after the galaxy wide extinction threat tbh
[2:45:29] <%jillyrancher> intergalactic spy type adventure
[2:45:34] <%Saffry_Ruzin> Leviathan DLC
[2:45:37] <NetherTable> hope you guys are ready to fight the SUPER REAPERS
[2:45:42] <%kyh9> @kyh9 Probably.  It just seems unlikely since he's by far an outlier with that opinion and there's not really a reason the Krogan shouldn't do it.  Like, they have everything to gain from rebelling again, and since they can cure the genophage on their own now, they'd probably win this time. The andromeda crew get back and see that Asari, Salarians, Turians and Humans got wiped out 1000 years ago lol
[2:45:45] <perfectharbinger> A lot of people are thinking followup to the Leviathan DLC.
[2:45:45] <+NeonLight> If ME3 was WWII, ME4 will be the Cold War
[2:45:46] <Sp3ctre48> Go back to Star Trek adventures hopefully
[2:45:50] <GuyverTypeL> Let it be the star child son xomimg for revenge
[2:45:51] <countyarc216> Smaller scale threat would be nice
[2:45:52] <%jillyrancher> pat suggested something smaller scale and that sounds good
[2:45:58] <%peachy996> Know what sucks about Andromeda's plot? The whole web infesting the galaxy is a cool idea but your focus is on the terrible rock men instead
[2:45:59] <perfectharbinger> I've also heard people suggest the Kett from Andromeda. But.. fuck that.
[2:46:09] <%AmericanSkidd> An entire game should be just the Citadel
[2:46:11] <Profmcstevie> Origin of the Reapers, some new race from a different galaxy, growing pains of rebuilding, there are places ME4 could go
[2:46:13] <ChungusQuest> Yeah, what if the Leviathans immediately turn on the rest of the galaxy and start slave-lording it up the second the reapers are dead?
[2:46:17] <%TheHateFish> Bring back the dark energy plotline
[2:46:21] <%kyh9> @kyh9 But it is definitely what bioware would make happen.  Wrex and Eve are just such main characters that they convince everyone else "noooo, stop beating up the other species.  Stoooop it guys!"
[2:46:26] <%Ravioli_Ronin> Fun fact: Zaheer’s kid fucking hates kett
[2:46:40] <%jillyrancher> origin of the Reapers is already explained

[2:47:03] <perfectharbinger> Well Pat suggested they could bring back the dark energy plot and literally just say the Catalyst lied.
[2:47:03] <%afronooch> he shy
[2:47:06] <%peachy996> The Kett need a drastic redesign to be vaguely interesting. less rock more crystalline
[2:47:06] <%jillyrancher> Theres only a few Leviathans left iir

[2:58:24] <Nightwolf656> @peachy996 Flare Fucks so much, it is the equivalent to a kamehame or a hadoukin
[2:58:27] <%NotMrDiddles> how can such a small dog be so strong
[2:58:36] <%AmericanSkidd> thats not right
[2:58:37] <%DrTomT18> don't need those yet
[2:58:45] <BigFingerRo> @peachy996 I wonder if he has an uncle called Grand Moff
[2:58:48] <perfectharbinger> Not yet. That isn't available yet.
[2:58:53] <%peachy996> Yeah it is a giant ass biotic energy projectile
[2:58:54] <28moogles> That list kinda sucks tbh
[2:59:04] <+alphonseisbest> @Nightwolf656 MAN Flare on a Vangard completes the DBZS vibe it has going on
[2:59:06] <PaperyHornet1013> not the last one
[2:59:12] <MiamiMemory> @PatStaresAt  Can you still probe Uranus in this game?
[2:59:13] <%jillyrancher> @patstaresat I think one of the best things in 3 is that it does a great job making you really feel how screwed the galaxy is. Reapers just kick our asses.
[2:59:14] <28moogles> Just do all the side stuff before the priority story missions, it aint complicated
[2:59:19] <%DrTomT18> wait, you should do Bennings first
[2:59:20] <quipquest1> Everyone's got a different mission order.
[2:59:22] <perfectharbinger> Yeah, do the missions and then hit the Citadel.
[2:59:23] <%trackles_64> pees on floor
[2:59:25] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt Don't do Cure the Genophage before you finish the other Tuchanka missions
[2:59:26] <Nightwolf656> That's why i want pat to get it so fuckin bad
[2:59:37] <Nightwolf656> instead of waiting till most way through the game
[2:59:52] <cpt_langosta> good plan
[2:59:55] <%DrTomT18> that Genophage is the very last thing you should do out of all these missions
[2:59:57] <ThatGuyThere03> Has Pat seen Kai Leng yet?
[3:00:00] <mikeriffic> how long are you playing tonight @PatStaresAt and still liking the game?
[3:00:04] <perfectharbinger> Yeah, that makes the most sense.
[3:00:07] <perfectharbinger> Not yet, Guy.
[3:00:10] <mikeriffic> @ThatGuyThere03 not yet
[3:00:10] <%tusk102> @NopeBadguy he has a guide
[3:00:16] <ThatGuyThere03> Damn
[3:00:19] <ChungusQuest> ScalyGang
[3:00:21] <$Spydurman> man you team on this game is really small
[3:00:22] <bahookery> good ol Gary Vakarian
[3:00:24] <BigFingerRo> hey, have we seen Tali at all ?
[3:00:25] <ThatGuyThere03> I wanna hear him talk massive amounts of shit about how lame he is
[3:00:27] <Sp3ctre48> No spoil the best characters
[3:00:36] <MiamiMemory> Muy Bueno
[3:00:36] <bahookery> @BigFingerRo not yet
[3:00:36] <%tusk102> @BigFingerRo no thats later
[3:00:37] <%peachy996> Tali is busy
[3:00:39] <KetsuoTaberu> chain overload is dope
[3:00:40] <$Spydurman> ya, where the fuck is Tali
[3:00:48] <mystfield327> hi pat
[3:00:49] <perfectharbinger> Well I'm sure you'll get your wish soon enough.
[3:01:07] <cpt_langosta> hacket, don't you do anything else?
[3:01:09] <%AmericanSkidd> not this stream we wont
[3:01:09] <%maenos2> oh this map
[3:01:11] <+kortin> Why don't the reapers just disable the Relays or set them to whatever mode the Omega relay has when they're invading, seems like their job would be easier if they planned ahead
[3:01:11] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[3:01:12] <TourettesPlays> @Spydurman she and virmire survivor are late game it kinda sucks
[3:01:13] <%afronooch> Whenever Tali isn't on screen, the audience should ask "Where's Tali?"
[3:01:15] <%peachy996> You will see Tali...Next week
[3:01:16] <%BluffRainbow> Hi @patstaresat hi chat how’s everyone doing today?
[3:01:17] <Madinki> @ThatGuyThere03 We got a ways to go before that he's still doing Krogan shit
[3:01:20] <quipquest1> Why does all of this stuff still work after 10 centuries?
[3:01:20] <%captain_kirkhammer> A 1300 year old facility should be just rubble
[3:01:30] <@Ranryu692> yes

[3:01:51] <perfectharbinger> @kortin That's actually what they do every other cycle but they need the Citadel to do that.
[3:01:51] <%jillyrancher> yeah
[3:01:53] <%AncelDeLambert> depends. The pyramids are pretty damn old
[3:01:55] <+NeonLight> I remember this map being hell

[3:03:08] <Madinki> RESPECT THE FUCKING TURRET
[3:03:09] <Latija> TURRETS ARE THE NEW NORMAL
[3:03:09] <jorniev> that lazzer
[3:03:10] <Sp3ctre48> ME3 multiplayer was the best honestly, as much as it was tacked on it was my favorite part of the game
[3:03:11] <perfectharbinger> Turrets are back, baby lol.
[3:03:12] <blackjack8182> F
[3:03:13] <$realm_forge> WASTED
[3:03:13] <%JamesCorck> Another Multiplayer mission.
[3:03:14] <%jillyrancher> Turret: psaMenace psaMenace psaMenace
[3:03:15] <%peachy996> fuck the reapers, Turrets are your enemy
[3:03:21] <%CalderGaming> multiplayer was fun except for use/cover/storm being stuck on the same button with no option to change it
[3:03:28] <+TrevSmith222> I have a lot of memories with Firebase Giant.  lol
[3:03:29] <@Ranryu692> turrets are no joke
[3:03:32] <Shade075> Wow the difficulty really is either brain dead easy or ball busting hard
[3:03:37] <%Ravioli_Ronin> So andromeda MP isn’t terrible, just dissapointing that it’s not ME3
[3:03:37] <cpt_langosta> CHARGE THAT TURRET!
[3:03:38] <PaperyHornet1013> "THIS HURTS YOU SHEPARD" -turret
[3:03:41] <bahookery> omg
[3:03:42] <%AzureGale> THAT'S A LOT OF DAMAGE
[3:03:45] <%peachy996> For now, yes it will be turrets to fear
[3:03:51] <%AncelDeLambert> yeah, don't charge those things
[3:03:53] <%tusk102> pat you should really nova the turrets
[3:03:53] <%Ravioli_Ronin> Surprisingly easy to get a match too
[3:03:53] <%jillyrancher> Turrets arent usually this broken, it's just Vanguards do REALLY bad at countering them.
[3:03:56] <$SGrim> HE'S LEARNING
[3:03:57] <bahookery> bruh that shotgun
[3:04:07] <28moogles> Stay behind cover. Then OVERLOAD- GUN. Turret die.
[3:04:08] <Nightwolf656> Each death is just so much more satisfying now that he has not only cheated the fuck out of his game but also lowered the difficulty to cake-walk
[3:04:09] <%Deft_Thought> What did he expect to find?
[3:04:09] <Sp3ctre48> Andromeda multiplayer is fine, but I always preferred ME3's
[3:04:11] <cooldude69xx> Two cerberus turrets and garrus VS Harbinger. How many rounds does harbinger stay up?
[3:04:12] <%peachy996> Personally I think Hardcore is the sweet spot for combot, just mind those turrets
[3:04:13] <ChungusQuest> To show you the power of CerbeTape...WE SAWED THIS SHEPARD IN HALF
[3:04:13] <%Deft_Thought> A big sword?
[3:04:14] <bahookery> did it first try
[3:04:15] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt garrus has overload for the turret shields
[3:04:18] <%AncelDeLambert> and now, to scrape the walls
[3:04:24] <Vermillion129> Did he just charge a damn turret?
[3:04:26] <%NopeBadguy> Check for upgrades before you activate that cannon
[3:04:27] <%AncelDeLambert> waaaaaaaall scrapin
[3:04:31] <$Spydurman> panel
[3:04:38] <+alphonseisbest> @jillyrancher nah u can take them out ez by  just doing nothing but charging into them over and over
[3:04:39] <%AncelDeLambert> no
[3:04:40] <28moogles> No?
[3:04:41] <%tusk102> a little
[3:04:41] <Sp3ctre48> yeah basically
[3:04:41] <%AncelDeLambert> it's pvp
[3:04:42] <IvanMistwalker> yes
[3:04:42] <%NopeBadguy> It can be PVP
[3:04:42] <DSD24> Yes
[3:04:43] <%CalderGaming> yeah kinda
[3:04:43] <psychoteletubby7> Yes
[3:04:43] <%toolofparanoia> basically
[3:04:44] <chainsaw105> its horde mode
[3:04:45] <SaltyAzteca> YES
[3:04:48] <%peachy996> What's killing floor?
[3:04:48] <%AzureGale> It's Gears of War Horde mode
[3:04:49] <Luizabd> not at all?
[3:04:50] <%toolofparanoia> but with objectives
[3:04:50] <mikeriffic> i meeeann
[3:04:50] <$Teh_Un> Kinda
[3:04:51] <bahookery> it's more like Gears of War horde mode
[3:04:52] <IvanMistwalker> kinda
[3:04:53] <%valriot> No its kinda like Gears horse mode with objectives
[3:04:53] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt Horde or PVP
[3:04:54] <+alphonseisbest> kinda
[3:04:54] <zhenthrim213> killing floor does own
[3:04:54] <cpt_langosta> IDK, I got no time for the killing floors.
[3:04:56] <DapperCadavr> Man, I miss the multiplayer so much
[3:05:00] <perfectharbinger> Kind of, yeah.
[3:05:00] <+DracosMagala> Whats Killing Floor?
[3:05:01] <%peachy996> It's PVE
[3:05:02] <+NeonLight> It was during the Horde Mode trend
[3:05:03] <mikeriffic> its wave/classed based gameplay with....its...kinda
[3:05:03] <%AncelDeLambert> it's been ten years, don't ask me
[3:05:03] <Sp3ctre48> Horde mode with objectives
[3:05:03] <%Deft_Thought> Eh, its a horde mode and you have powers.
[3:05:05] <%tusk102> its wave based survival+do mini missions during waves @PatStaresAt
[3:05:05] <28moogles> ME3 Multiplayer was a horde mode, but it also had cool objectives and MANY playable characters.
[3:05:08] <%toolofparanoia> like every five waves theres an objective to complete
[3:05:12] <blackjack8182> Horde Mode
[3:05:12] <%Ynkubus_> only that its a horde mode
[3:05:12] <perfectharbinger> It's Killing Floor with objectives and no boss at the very end.
[3:05:13] <%HaroldDonchee> why was the multi-player so much fucking fun
[3:05:19] <%Ravioli_Ronin> Horde but fun but kinda bad cause EA loot boxes
[3:05:21] <%jillyrancher> @ravioli_ronin Even on 360 it's easy to find matches lol
[3:05:21] <Madinki> "AHH TURRET MY OLD NEMISSIS, I SEE WE'RE DOING THIS DANCE ONCE MORE!"
[3:05:22] <%Deft_Thought> It's like Warframe without the mobility
[3:05:22] <bahookery> you can still find a lot of people playing on pc
[3:05:30] <bahookery> bonk
[3:05:31] <%tusk102> lmao
[3:05:35] <chainsaw105> WOMEN! *punch*
[3:05:35] <+NeonLight> ME4 better bring back MP
[3:05:36] <AngryAsian5> LUL
[3:05:37] <%peachy996> Big Punch
[3:05:41] <28moogles> Everyone forgets that the mid-wave objectives were part of the charm of the formula.
[3:05:45] <cpt_langosta> just... set this lady on fire, then punch her in the spine until she dies...
[3:05:48] <%Saffry_Ruzin> Killing Floor but with Objectives and different races
[3:05:59] <bahookery> YEET
[3:06:13] <cpt_langosta> CHARGE, YEYEYE
[3:06:20] <+TrevSmith222> Didn't really mind the loot boxes in this game seeing as how it's not PvP.
[3:06:21] <bahookery> so many turrets
[3:06:23] <%aWanderingKaivo> bamboozled
[3:06:26] <%jillyrancher> @patstaresat There was a multiplayer character that is a Krogan Battlemaster with a giant hammer
[3:06:27] <%peachy996> Yeah! that's the MP way
[3:06:27] <zhenthrim213> TURRET INTO TURRET COMBO
[3:06:29] <%AmericanSkidd> what was the class with the biotic whips, that was dope
[3:06:32] <%peachy996> Roll away to find cover
[3:06:33] <%Ravioli_Ronin> OhMyDog
[3:06:35] <%peachy996> You're learning it
[3:06:37] <Shade075> A POSE
[3:06:38] <+skeletonmilk> jesus on the cross
[3:06:38] <akitanito> that's an awkward death
[3:06:40] <Madinki> YOU THROUGHT THERE WAS JUST ONE?!
[3:06:41] <%NopeBadguy> Don't forget you can hold for Heavy Melee instead of just mashing
[3:06:43] <Parapattern> Crucified
[3:06:43] <ChungusQuest> He dies for your wins
[3:06:46] <%jillyrancher> Phoenix vanguard
[3:06:48] <%MidnightBurst12> died in a jesus pose
[3:06:50] <%RJay80> noone expects Second Turret
[3:06:51] <+NeonLight> X_X
[3:06:52] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt charge recharges shields and slows time slightly so you can charge the turrets, nova, then charge the second nova is over pretty much so you never take true damage
[3:06:52] <%RealThiele> T
[3:06:53] <zhenthrim213> jesus
[3:06:54] <Sp3ctre48> @AmericanSkidd Cerberus Dragoon
[3:06:56] <%toolofparanoia> POP
[3:06:57] <MiamiMemory> TOASTY!
[3:06:59] <SaltyAzteca> EXTRA CRISPY
[3:07:02] <Nightwolf656> @NeonLight Seeing as how the entire online community won't STFU about MP there is a fairly good chance they will bring it back to the Legendary Edition with some BS attached to it so they can make money
[3:07:03] <stantheman_97> pop
[3:07:03] <cpt_langosta> don't worry, they have three heads
[3:07:06] <PaperyHornet1013> good job pat
[3:07:08] <%aWanderingKaivo> yeah that happens in ME3 if you do enough overkill damage to the head
[3:07:11] <%toolofparanoia> this game had the best gore
[3:07:12] <%AmericanSkidd> yeah that shit was rad
[3:07:17] <IvanMistwalker> CHRISPY
[3:07:19] <alrobot2014> there's an achievement for head popping the shield ones called "Mailslot"
[3:07:20] <%peachy996> Hey quick look at Garrus!

[3:07:59] <%peachy996> Garrus is just being your Hannibal Burress
[3:08:04] <Madinki> *sniff* what is that head and shoulders Shepard?
[3:08:05] <zhenthrim213> i hear turret
[3:08:07] <%AncelDeLambert> despite all the problems with this game, the multiplayer was pretty good
[3:08:16] <%AncelDeLambert> shame you had to suffer Origin to play it
[3:08:21] <BigFingerRo> Why does England talk like that @PatStaresAt ?
[3:08:23] <mikeriffic> anyone remember the Earth DLC for ME3 MP, with the N7 chars and the Earth maps like Rio
[3:08:34] <sirrice77> So how are you able to just easily operate this ancient ass technology?
[3:08:35] <BigFingerRo> they all talk just like that, why?
[3:08:40] <%peachy996> Rio is a good map
[3:08:41] <%jillyrancher> N7 Paladin
[3:08:50] <%Alig200> N7 Fury
[3:08:51] <%peachy996> It can hurt you but it's a good map
[3:08:59] <bahookery> kablammo
[3:09:02] <Sp3ctre48> I always hated the earth maps but the new characters they added were insane
[3:09:06] <cpt_langosta> now steal their lunch out of the fridge!
[3:09:08] <$Teh_Un> Loot time
[3:09:13] <psychoteletubby7> Volus master race
[3:09:13] <%AmericanSkidd> big chuffed
[3:09:15] <chainsaw105> I remember the first MP character I ever got to level 20 was a Salarian Infiltrator
[3:09:19] <%peachy996> The only maps in MP that I have big problems with are Tuchanka Night and London
[3:09:22] <jorniev> are there still skills to get for the vanguard?
[3:09:28] <ChungusQuest> Charge and Pull...until it is done
[3:09:30] <Sp3ctre48> Then they added the Collectors to the MP and I hated everything NotLikeThis
[3:09:31] <%akscully> go out and watch
[3:09:37] <%akscully> or not
[3:09:42] <+NopeBadguy> da blip go out
[3:09:44] <%aWanderingKaivo> @chainsaw105 man I played a bunch but still never unlocked salarian infil. sad times

[3:09:58] <Sp3ctre48> yeah
[3:10:01] <%peachy996> Salarian Infiltrator was my main. He rocks
[3:10:01] <ape_hawk> ye
[3:10:01] <%Alig200> thats the justification for all of the MP maps, yeah.
[3:10:02] <%DrTomT18> yeah, all the Multiplayer Maps have a reason for existing
[3:10:03] <%akscully> yep
[3:10:06] <%AmericanSkidd> i guess it is
[3:10:08] <%Rumbutt> That would be multiplayer unlock
[3:10:10] <+pmtriox> do you feel fullfilled yet?
[3:10:16] <%jillyrancher> Are we gonna finish Tuchanka tonight
[3:10:16] <%toolofparanoia> Spec Ops missions!
[3:10:19] <Nightwolf656> @jorniev the most OP biotics in the game are still available to him
[3:10:21] <zhenthrim213> oof
[3:10:22] <%aWanderingKaivo> Asari huntress infiltrator was fun
[3:10:23] <Sp3ctre48> It's okay, he sucked
[3:10:24] <%akscully> @mr_saturday93 I know, but I can dream
[3:10:25] <jorniev> i miss the M2 mission accomplished scene
[3:10:25] <%tusk102> the multiplayer is n7 task forces doing operations basically @PatStaresAt
[3:10:27] <cpt_langosta> "Yes, Commander?" "No...!"

[3:14:21] <Dunmarkh> 2chanka
[3:14:23] <%Alig200> he didn't get the war assets pop-up the firsr time, didn't he?
[3:14:27] <%NopeBadguy> Ab-ductions
[3:14:30] <%captain_kirkhammer> Shepard can save the galaxy from the Reapers but can he save Christmas?

[3:14:43] <%Eilocke> the Reapers are defeated, the world is saved, "hey commander, thanks for the..."
[3:14:48] <%AmericanSkidd> @captain_kirkhammer I want this so bad omg
[3:14:50] <%JamesCorck> That's another multiplayer mission, you can do later on, tho.
[3:14:51] <perfectharbinger> I just got the creepiest Red Rooster ad.
[3:14:56] <IvanMistwalker> do you see?
[3:14:56] <%peachy996> Benning! Great MP Map for Reapers.
[3:14:59] <chainsaw105> @captain_kirkhammer if its Woolie he's facing up against? not a chance in hell
[3:15:09] <theplayster> eventually you won't be able to explore area when there is a reaper
[3:15:10] <santafer> ah it's that the one with rain?
[3:15:17] <%DrTomT18> they need new recruits
[3:15:20] <bahookery> best MP map
[3:15:21] <%NopeBadguy> Is it because they're assholes?
[3:15:22] <MiamiMemory> For the LOLs
[3:15:22] <%JamesCorck> You find out why close to the end of the game.
[3:15:23] <PaperyHornet1013> I hope he does the cure mission tonight

[3:15:36] <%peachy996> yeah but rain won't be on this mission
[3:15:38] <perfectharbinger> It's pretty difficult to see but we can point it out.

[3:16:44] <$realm_forge> Pat no you’re turning British
[3:16:46] <%brisk_dacat> As long as ppl know it’s big. Who cares how you pronounce it
[3:16:52] <+DracosMagala> Benning kolKataLUL
[3:16:54] <%AmericanSkidd> A Rouge faction in Cerberous?
[3:16:54] <IvanMistwalker> YEAH
[3:16:56] <+pmtriox> YOU DON'T SAY PAT
[3:16:59] <+pmtriox> imagine that
[3:17:00] <+D00msDayDan> at least these have better presentation than those damn filler missions in ME2
[3:17:00] <%DrTomT18> It's possibel
[3:17:02] <Sp3ctre48> Oh I never really liked this map, Geth on long sightline maps was the worst
[3:17:06] <+pmtriox> what a shock
[3:17:09] <%DrTomT18> I mean, you SAW THEM KIDNAPPING CHILDREN
[3:17:10] <TioXyco> as always, rogue faction, because easier to explain
[3:17:10] <theplayster> oh this item
[3:17:11] <bahookery> isn't Cerberus just like not even 1000 people in ME3
[3:17:14] <28moogles> Remember to look for an item for the side-quest here.
[3:17:14] <Alzero83> I remember this map
[3:17:16] <%trackles_64> Multyplayer misssions
[3:17:18] <IvanMistwalker> I loved this MP map
[3:17:20] <chainsaw105> god did they fix that fuckin bug with that Citadel Turian's side mission not being able to be completed after Citadel 2?
[3:17:20] <bahookery> it's like a couple of separate cells
[3:17:21] <%4DLuvOfLuthy> i hated this multiplayer map lol
[3:17:23] <%RealThiele> well the alliance hates them anyways
[3:17:24] <%peachy996> That's why I like the Reapers here
[3:17:24] <perfectharbinger> Yeah, this map kinda sucks on multiplayer.
[3:17:25] <%aWanderingKaivo> look at this colonial hellhole
[3:17:27] <@Ranryu692> another MP map
[3:17:28] <theplayster> yeah it is like on floor and you can barely see it
[3:17:29] <+ScrapKingKeita> they live in shipping containers
[3:17:30] <DSD24> This Map is Great
[3:17:33] <MiamiMemory> Ship container world
[3:17:33] <ScreamLord> A shanty town?
[3:17:33] <%Rumbutt> Oh look, another multiplayer map
[3:17:34] <santafer> slum planet
[3:17:35] <%Faustgesicht> Favorite Mp map right here.
[3:17:36] <stantheman_97> looks cool and dystopian
[3:17:37] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> Urban Sprawl
[3:17:38] <Virokwet> gotta use those assets
[3:17:38] <Dunmarkh> It's the ready player one world
[3:17:38] <%aWanderingKaivo> turrets go brr already
[3:17:39] <%peachy996> Geth and Cerberus are a pain on this map, Collectors sometimes
[3:17:41] <quipquest1> Cerberus: We're killing humanity for humanity.
[3:17:44] <+RowenCleric> nah this mqps great
[3:17:46] <+alphonseisbest> @bahookery wut?! no there like 10mil strong
[3:17:46] <@Ranryu692> oh no, Yuri Lowenthal just got shot
[3:17:46] <Zombrocom> Literally EVERY time cerebus is doing a big evil, they go all "It's a rogue section!" Jack, the overlord project, this thing. It keeps happening.
[3:17:46] <cpt_langosta> hear that?
[3:17:47] <Sp3ctre48> sucks for that guy
[3:17:48] <$realm_forge> Hive world
[3:17:48] <akitanito> turret too OP
[3:17:49] <%CoffeeKaiju> yeah this is a mp map
[3:17:49] <Maids4lyfe> it's the shit deus ex planets
[3:17:49] <jorniev> this looks like ready player one planet
[3:17:51] <blackjack8182> Cerberus was supposed to be indoctrinated according to the e3 demo
[3:17:52] <+RowenCleric> maps
[3:17:54] <%SovPho> I choose you, Civilimon!
[3:17:55] <%Saffry_Ruzin> Another MP map
[3:17:57] <cpt_langosta> almost sounds like...
[3:17:58] <%Faustgesicht> God that snipers alley was incredible
[3:17:59] <+pmtriox> you're in that cg town in Ready Player One now
[3:18:00] <LLCoolZJ> I swear half of the multiplayer matches I played was on this map.
[3:18:01] <cpt_langosta> TURRET!
[3:18:01] <blackjack8182> Look at the floor
[3:18:01] <+ThomasOfTroy> Oh yeah, this map
[3:18:02] <+DracosMagala> Looks like Mankind Divided
[3:18:02] <%Ravioli_Ronin> “What if we take the poofs, and stack them someplace else?”
[3:18:05] <PaperyHornet1013> military tribunals
[3:18:09] <%RealThiele> Ohno! Anyways
[3:18:12] <%afronooch> LUL
[3:18:12] <MiamiMemory> What does Cerebus gain by killing civilians?
[3:18:16] <akitanito> pffffft
[3:18:16] <%tusk102> the worst mp maps were always the ones with large open areas because if you arent a vanguard you had no way of getting across quickly without getting riddled with lead
[3:18:17] <%4DLuvOfLuthy> to the moon!
[3:18:17] <+D00msDayDan> can't spell civilian without villain
[3:18:19] <perfectharbinger> So the evidence is right near where you're standing.
[3:18:21] <%NopeBadguy> He took NO fall damage
[3:18:22] <theplayster> @PatStaresAt the item you are looking is that spot
[3:18:24] <%peachy996> He got proper fucked
[3:18:26] <MAX116030> I think it would have been easier to make another factions of bandits and pirates who just "screw it all" and trying to survive without moral compass
[3:18:27] <perfectharbinger> It's on the ground near a pillar.
[3:18:28] <%peachy996> him too
[3:18:29] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> Jesus Joel
[3:18:33] <%toolofparanoia> he was a popper
[3:18:35] <quipquest1> Shoot them when they're down, like a hero.
[3:18:35] <%RealThiele> yeetus deletus
[3:18:38] <morcego_cinzento_arts> a big problem with Cerberus is that they are kinda like the ME version of Wayland-Yutani "oh this new alien kills entire species.....i beat we can weaponize it"
[3:18:38] <%Faustgesicht> Eyyyy you popped him
[3:18:42] <%akscully> item is around here
[3:18:46] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt the item is near the pillars
[3:18:51] <perfectharbinger> Item is here.
[3:18:52] <Sp3ctre48> I remember people just kicking you if you tried to play vanguard classes on these maps LUL
[3:18:52] <$realm_forge> Don’t loose your head over it
[3:18:56] <%Ravioli_Ronin> Laughs in Geth Juggernaut
[3:18:59] <cpt_langosta> "my people"
[3:19:07] <santafer> are they Canadians?
[3:19:08] <%afronooch> The one by itself
[3:19:10] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> @realm_forge Booooooo
[3:19:11] <%AmericanSkidd> oh here we go
[3:19:13] <theplayster> there is another one
[3:19:19] <cpt_langosta> yep
[3:19:19] <%AmericanSkidd> nailed it
[3:19:21] <%RealThiele> space Toronto
[3:19:21] <Dunmarkh> FUCK THAT
[3:19:22] <blackjack8182> Floor
[3:19:23] <%tusk102> yep
[3:19:23] <theplayster> booya
[3:19:24] <dekkitout> The fucking hell is that
[3:19:25] <Sp3ctre48> That's psychotic
[3:19:26] <SaltyAzteca> ITS SO SMALL
[3:19:29] <%trackles_64> its so dumb
[3:19:29] <%aWanderingKaivo> are you.. just not going to get it?
[3:19:30] <DeepPix3l> *Screams of Terror in the background*
[3:19:32] <perfectharbinger> Yeah, that's awful lol.
[3:19:35] <+pmtriox> not even a prompt that you picked it up either THANKS BIOWARE
[3:19:36] <$realm_forge> LUL
[3:19:36] <%DrTomT18> People are dying and Shepards looking for a dot on the ground
[3:19:37] <%peachy996> just use your special eyes
[3:19:39] <ScreamLord> It looks like any other bit of random garbage on the floor
[3:19:41] <MiamiMemory> That looks like the battle pass
[3:19:41] <blackjack8182> It’s bad
[3:19:41] <%AmericanSkidd> AND NOTHING POPS UP TELLING YOU WHAT IT IS OR FOR
[3:19:45] <moonmeh> this was also a multiplayer map
[3:19:46] <cpt_langosta> game's like, "I hope you're scraping the ground with your nose every mission"
[3:19:47] <moonmeh> i think
[3:19:52] <Alzero83> CiV Villains?
[3:19:57] <%jillyrancher> IT DOESNT EVEN TELL YOU YOU PICKED IT UP
[3:19:58] <%Alig200> Liara sets em up, Garrus knocks em down
[3:19:59] <%afronooch> i think theres supposed to be dialogue there
[3:20:01] <theplayster> big singularity my firends
[3:20:02] <%afronooch> when you pick it up
[3:20:04] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt it didnt even pop up to tell you it got picked up lmao
[3:20:06] <dekkitout> Didnt know Larry was a Zarya main
[3:20:14] <%RealThiele> B E E G SUCC
[3:20:20] <DeepPix3l> Escort Missions ResidentSleeper
[3:20:27] <Latija> BIG SINGULARITY
[3:20:29] <moonmeh> biotic powers be super strong
[3:20:31] <theplayster> @tusk102 it doesn't pop during the combat
[3:20:31] <cpt_langosta> credits in the oven!?
[3:20:32] <quipquest1> It's a Zero-G Party
[3:20:42] <%aWanderingKaivo> give them the big succ
[3:20:43] <%DrTomT18> Shockwave and Singularity go GREAT together
[3:20:55] <%Ravioli_Ronin> Is the blackhole gun from 2 in here?
[3:21:00] <%aWanderingKaivo> @DrTomT18 good ole human adept in MP
[3:21:02] <%4DLuvOfLuthy> he doesnt want to make it too easy for you lol
[3:21:02] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt throw detonates people in singularity btw
[3:21:04] <+pmtriox> hurricane sucks as a gun but i like its raspberry fart noise
[3:21:07] <%toolofparanoia> GARRUS! IM ENJOYING A TREAT GARRUS!
[3:21:11] <%peachy996> "Bitch! I love you."
[3:21:14] <Sp3ctre48> Garrus strong but no brain
[3:21:18] <Latija> mass effect is a strategy game now
[3:21:20] <Latija> GENRE
[3:21:24] <%PlainSimpleTailor> This music is sounding like cheap ass Babylon 5 music LOL
[3:21:28] <%aWanderingKaivo> hurricane is great lol
[3:21:29] <%DrTomT18> No
[3:21:32] <Dunmarkh> no
[3:21:32] <$StrawberryPantsu> Man could you imagine doing this with 2 other people? That would be sooooooooo cool!
[3:21:37] <cpt_langosta> no thro
[3:21:38] <Sp3ctre48> You have shockwave
[3:21:38] <%aWanderingKaivo> top tier SMG
[3:21:41] <%AmericanSkidd> does pull?
[3:21:41] <%afronooch> charge detonates too
[3:21:41] <ScreamLord> No, but SHockwave works too
[3:21:42] <quipquest1> This is why I don't trust companions in combat.
[3:21:42] <+pmtriox> most things will detonate it though
[3:21:43] <IvanMistwalker> shockwave works
[3:21:44] <$Mekhet09> YOU DON"T KNOW ABOUT BIOTIC COMBOS
[3:21:46] <Latija> @PlainSimpleTailor yeah this sounds really generic
[3:21:48] <stormhawk9891> Shockwave and pull works too
[3:21:50] <theplayster> I think pull too work too
[3:21:56] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @Ravioli_Ronin You can find it in one mission as a ingle use weapon. the ME2 heavy weapon concept became weapons you can only find in some missions
[3:22:00] <+unhuggable1> charge works too
[3:22:02] <$Mekhet09> Jesus christ pat biotic combos are the most op shit.
[3:22:02] <%toolofparanoia> that was a meaty death noise
[3:22:03] <%jillyrancher> *Turret teleports behind you*
[3:22:03] <+Dova573> Oh man I loved this map in MP
[3:22:07] <%aWanderingKaivo> pull is NOT a detonator
[3:22:18] <Sp3ctre48> pull will only work if they don't have shields
[3:22:19] <%AmericanSkidd> singlarity
[3:22:20] <@Ranryu692> pull is a set-up, not a detonator
[3:22:22] <Sp3ctre48> I think
[3:22:26] <Maids4lyfe> pull does not detonate
[3:22:27] <Shockmaster182> Do you believe in gravity, Shepard?
[3:22:31] <+pmtriox> oh it 100% does not its all wibbly who cares now
[3:22:42] <Flame_Water> thiswas a great mp map
[3:22:46] <%Ravioli_Ronin> @morcego_cinzento_arts ah ok
[3:22:46] <$ainzhelm> Remember guys, Pat said pull didn’t work in ME2
[3:22:49] <Sp3ctre48> Or it doesn't work at all, cool
[3:22:55] <%aWanderingKaivo> you could pull and have Liara warp though, that would combo
[3:22:56] <stormhawk9891> Oh wait I'm thinking of Lash not pull
[3:22:58] <+RyanTheRecluse> pull and throw can curve around corners if you use them right
[3:23:02] <%jillyrancher> throw detonates
[3:23:04] <theplayster> the combos has a tight timing to actually proc usually
[3:23:05] <%DrTomT18> Pull is pretty funny because you're just helplessly floating through the air
[3:23:07] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @Ravioli_Ronin oh i now realized i made a mistake, i thought you were talking about the nuke one. No the black hole heavy gun does not return
[3:23:13] <Sp3ctre48> Most biotics didn't work right in ME2 tbf
[3:23:15] <%RealThiele> some Shooting stars shit
[3:23:24] <Maids4lyfe> Warp and Shockwave are what makes it explode @PatStaresAt
[3:23:27] <dekkitout> Who's talking
[3:23:28] <%aWanderingKaivo> LUL
[3:23:28] <PaperyHornet1013> OH NO
[3:23:29] <cpt_langosta> WE ARE TURRET. WE KNOW THIS HURTS YOU.
[3:23:32] <%peachy996> One thing I do like about Andromeda is there's lots of combos leading to explosions
[3:23:32] <choocheess> LUL
[3:23:34] <zhenthrim213> lol
[3:23:36] <ape_hawk> if we die, we die together
[3:23:36] <+condemned_15> who's shooting
[3:23:39] <$ainzhelm> @sp3ctre48 They absolutely do
[3:23:41] <Sp3ctre48> Civilians are so fucking dramatic
[3:23:42] <%aWanderingKaivo> I forget if Nova detonates?
[3:23:44] <%peachy996> That's the ol MP "Oh NO!" sprint
[3:23:44] <Shockmaster182> Does pat still have it set on normal or is it back on hardcore?
[3:23:46] <%toolofparanoia> coward run!
[3:23:47] <AngryAsian5> Haha turret go brrrr
[3:23:47] <Profmcstevie> I fear no man...but that thing? It scares me
[3:23:47] <Goatllama> Get him out of here, get him out of here!
[3:23:48] <$Mekhet09> Play this on a higher difficulty then normal and see how that works out for you lol.
[3:23:48] <Latija> don't you have to curve pull around cover? or is that another ability
[3:23:50] <ScreamLord> Pat finally caved and used his medi-gel
[3:23:51] <chainsaw105> ah yes the final boss, Turret Shields
[3:23:53] <%peachy996> Pat these tactics are common in MP
[3:24:02] <%Alig200> @Shockmaster182 he set it back to Hardcore, yeah.
[3:24:03] <%peachy996> And I like seeing them again
[3:24:04] <%toolofparanoia> Turret = psaBig coward
[3:24:05] <morcego_cinzento_arts> At this point Cerberus should make flying drones with those turrets
[3:24:05] <%jillyrancher> Turret: Nothing personal kid. psaMenace psaMenace psaMenace psaMenace
[3:24:12] <PunchSlugfest> If we die, we die together
[3:24:13] <akitanito> cerberus space program
[3:24:14] <quipquest1> Nice Jumps
[3:24:15] <ScreamLord> You have to hit the dude
[3:24:22] <Maids4lyfe> it has to hit them
[3:24:23] <PaperyHornet1013> @Mekhet09 we got him to change it back
[3:24:26] <+pmtriox> so i assume this is on normal or something?
[3:24:33] <%jillyrancher> if we die, we die together.
[3:24:35] <theplayster> it has to be the enemy that is affected by the sing not the sing itself
[3:24:35] <Sp3ctre48> yeah
[3:24:38] <%aWanderingKaivo> he was already dead but it still worked lol
[3:24:42] <SaltyAzteca> IF WE DIE WE DIE TOGETHER
[3:24:45] <%peachy996> We didn't get him to he just decided to
[3:24:46] <%aWanderingKaivo> biotic corpse explosion
[3:24:47] <quipquest1> @chainsaw105 We have dismissed those claims.
[3:24:48] <alrobot2014> @pmtriox hardcore
[3:24:52] <%AmericanSkidd> are we not back on hardcore?
[3:24:54] <$ainzhelm> One day pat will figure out all the mechanics. Maybe on the third playthrough
[3:24:56] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt warp and pull detonate iirc
[3:25:00] <PunchSlugfest> WE MADE IT
[3:25:03] <cpt_langosta> these centurions keep farting, its really gross
[3:25:05] <%tusk102> i meant throw
[3:25:05] <+DracosMagala> Search the place
[3:25:06] <Latija> wow i remember this mp level
[3:25:15] <Zombrocom> Pull doesn't detonate, it's a primer
[3:25:15] <%tusk102> pull and then throw detonates
[3:25:16] <MiamiMemory> @aWanderingKaivo  Thats a badass band name
[3:25:23] <ScreamLord> You save like 4 people
[3:25:29] <quipquest1> Cool, now back to the stuff that matters
[3:25:38] <cpt_langosta> YET
[3:25:40] <%DrTomT18> YES IT IS
[3:25:40] <+pmtriox> IS IT NOT?
[3:25:43] <zhenthrim213> WHAT
[3:25:46] <%RealThiele> that was odd
[3:25:48] <%4DLuvOfLuthy> ummm yea it is lol
[3:25:48] <DeepPix3l> But... theyre indoctrinated
[3:25:48] <+pmtriox> what?

[3:25:56] <Sp3ctre48> I don't understand the story here, why would it not be Cerberus?
[3:26:00] <+pmtriox> what a clearly stupid statement
[3:26:03] <%DJFakie> bye multiplayer map
[3:26:03] <+senfood> Cerberus just guns down innocent aliens.
[3:26:04] <%peachy996> oh no Hack it out?

[3:26:43] <PaperyHornet1013> Shes a paragon
[3:26:44] <Alzero83> I remember those scans used to take FOREVER
[3:26:45] <ape_hawk> always snitch, people
[3:26:45] <chainsaw105> snitch all day every day
[3:26:46] <%gliph13> @Sp3ctre48 Cerberus would rather abduct civilians then kill them, the latter gains them nothing
[3:26:47] <+pmtriox> its not
[3:26:47] <+condemned_15> big snitch
[3:26:48] <@Ranryu692> the Pat calling the kettle black

[3:27:37] <+pmtriox> you forgot to check the other planets just in case they had stuff for side quests since your quest log doesn't update if you picked up quest items or not

[3:40:53] <hereiam407> Good
[3:40:54] <theplayster> it is... wait for citadel dlc
[3:40:54] <%SovPho> good game, bad ending
[3:40:57] <%PlainSimpleTailor> 'cept the ending
[3:40:59] <@Ranryu692> and it still feels like they couldn't put in everything they wanted to
[3:40:59] <%jillyrancher> You suck
[3:41:00] <%aWanderingKaivo> yeh yeh
[3:41:01] <theplayster> another 2 hours for the party\

[3:41:01] <%Ravioli_Ronin> YEAH
[3:41:03] <$TallYoda08> sipsipDab sipsipDab sipsipDab sipsipDab
[3:41:04] <%tusk102> pat you're not even a fourth through
[3:41:04] <%Rumbutt> It just makes that ending EVEN WORSE
[3:41:04] <+DeadlyPeaks> Will Pat cry? Find out next time!
[3:41:05] <%peachy996> Decent apples
[3:41:05] <%RetroCop87> How bad is the ending going to have to be to ruin the game you've loved so far?
[3:41:05] <%JamesCorck> You think a good game with a shitty ending is good, despite its shitty ending.
[3:41:07] <hereiam407> Get that baby delievered
[3:41:07] <Zombrocom> 90% great
[3:41:07] <morcego_cinzento_arts> Tune in next time when Shepard cures the balls and wombs of a species of marauders and they will fucking raid the galaxy again
[3:41:07] <%4DLuvOfLuthy> yea its not bad, just flounders at the end
[3:41:10] <moonmeh> oh yeah i had fun playing ME3 until the ending
[3:41:11] <%toolofparanoia> Great game, rushed ending
[3:41:11] <%AzureGale> Settle da orb
[3:41:12] <%HaroldDonchee> what genre was the stream tonight
[3:41:13] <Astrophizz> people exaggerated?!!
[3:41:14] <moonmeh> DOG
[3:41:15] <%jillyrancher> for real Tuchanka is my favorite mission tho @patstaresat
[3:41:18] <Nightwolf656> fuckn lame lol
[3:41:18] <%Ravioli_Ronin> ORB
[3:41:19] <PaperyHornet1013> best game in the series
[3:41:19] <$Mekhet09> @PatStaresAt All the side quests are better but I feel like the main quest is shit.
[3:41:23] <%AzureGale> Time 2 let dog pee, take two
[3:41:25] <Shade075> If you shut off the game before the ending ME3 is amazing
[3:41:27] <moonmeh> hell yeah
[3:41:32] <moonmeh> let the dog piss
[3:41:32] <quipquest1> According to StreamFourStar, both this and ME2 is crap
[3:41:34] <%DrTomT18> ya know what I think I'll pass on that lmao
[3:41:38] <%RetroCop87> ferrets are cute, but they FUCKING STINK
[3:41:38] <alrobot2014> watch him get distracted by another strange animal
[3:41:38] <Sp3ctre48> eh I think ME3 has a lot more wrong with it than just the ending
[3:41:41] <%Ravioli_Ronin> Thus begins the ferret arc
[3:41:41] <%jillyrancher> I wanna see tears next stream Pat
[3:41:41] <blackjack8182> Remember you’re not playing the release version
[3:41:42] <%toolofparanoia> GENRE WARS
[3:41:44] <$ainzhelm> Im going to be controversial and say andromeda has a worse ending because its the most nothing, where as at least 3 made me feel something
[3:41:46] <%peachy996> the next 2 missions are a good combo for next stream
[3:42:03] <Nightwolf656> Have a good night everyone i'm going to go eat, later
[3:42:05] <%afronooch> yeah theres a lot of problems with me3 besides the ending
[3:42:08] <%peachy996> Andromeda's plotis so bland there's nothing to feel
[3:42:11] <%jillyrancher> Oh fuck next stream Pat will see Dweeb Leng
[3:42:15] <%afronooch> they're just kinda meh in the face of the ending
[3:42:24] <%peachy996> You're saving not earth from Rock men
[3:42:28] <PaperyHornet1013> weeb leng
[3:42:35] <%peachy996> and MAYBE you make a long distance call
[3:42:50] <Shade075> ME:A's story is as expressive as it's characters facial features
[3:42:50] <%jillyrancher> Kai Loser
[3:42:56] <%MelBrooksKA> immersive sim is suck a dumb, useless name that I didn't even hear about it till last Monday
[3:42:57] <%peachy996> that's it. The ending is you making a long distance call and hoping the cooler galaxy will pick up the phone
[3:43:07] <Sp3ctre48> I wouldn't even say the ending is that bad tbh, most of the game was building up to a really meh conclusion
[3:43:28] <$ainzhelm> @peachy996 What if the reapers looked like those giant stone faces in Gurren L with the stock sound effect evil laugh
[3:43:39] <%toolofparanoia> ME3's ending was fine until that final cutscene which left a big plothole of questions... then they kinda elaborate stuff in the ending dlc that makes it more bearable and less artsy trash
[3:43:51] <%jillyrancher> launch ending really was THAT bad. extended cut took the edge off by miles
[3:43:57] <%peachy996> Still I think despite the plot being as bland as it is, Jaal Drack Kallo and Vetra were nice to hang out with. Hell even Cora is okay
[3:44:03] <Zombrocom> They kinda wrote themselves into a corner and tried to deus ex machina themselves out of it but executed it super bad
[3:44:13] <%hrbeck_> Blussy forever
[3:44:14] <Sp3ctre48> I think extended cut made certain things worse lol
[3:44:26] <%afronooch> yea
[3:44:26] <%jillyrancher> I remember what the launch was like lol. like 6 minutes to end the trilogy. was a fucking joke.
[3:44:46] <%peachy996> Oh god the base game endings were a tragic joke
[3:44:48] <Sp3ctre48> but that's me, when you elaborate more on a bad idea it doesn't really change my mind about it being bad
[3:44:58] <%peachy996> Ending your trilogy on that was Terrible
[3:45:06] <%jillyrancher> nowadays the ending doesn't really bother me.
[3:45:08] <knight_verse> The Reaper war is dire AF, the only way you can win is with deus ex machina bullshit.
[3:45:10] <$ainzhelm> All the companions in andromeda suck. They have qualities of things you like, but no real character. Peebee is literally the only one with an arc
[3:45:25] <%peachy996> yeah but I need a little more closure than....Tell me another story about the sheperd
[3:45:34] <morcego_cinzento_arts> To think that such a disastrous ending to a good game was because Casey Hudson's last minute stupidity
[3:45:35] <%peachy996> Fuck Peebee
[3:45:37] <Sp3ctre48> I forgot her name was Peebee NotLikeThis
[3:45:40] <%jillyrancher> fuck that shit
[3:45:43] <studleydoorite> don't they get tired of dancing
[3:45:43] <%aWanderingKaivo> Drack is pretty cool though
[3:45:45] <%afronooch> peebee is the WORST lol
[3:45:46] <%peachy996> Fuck the Asari
[3:45:53] <knight_verse> BTW, Andromeda did the dark energy plotline... make of that what you will.
[3:45:56] <$ainzhelm> I know thats why i said they all suck. The best written companion is the annoying one
[3:46:03] <%afronooch> Jaal is the only interesting character, and hes basically male Liara
[3:46:03] <%jillyrancher> I dunno where Pat got that it was all Casey Hudson fault. I think he was just making that up.
[3:46:08] <%hrbeck_> I mean, yeah, fuck the asari
[3:46:12] <Sp3ctre48> I mean, she sucks but she's one of the better characters in Andromeda
[3:46:22] <%peachy996> Nah
[3:46:41] <Sp3ctre48> Like imagine making the cute badass female Turian character boring, at least Peebee has a personality
[3:46:45] <%peachy996> I'd rather spend my time talking to Kallo about the Ship than spend a second with PB
[3:46:57] <$ainzhelm> Fucking Cora starts and resolves her loyalty drama in the same first sentence
[3:46:59] <%toolofparanoia> Only thing I remember about Andromeda was my gay turian waifu. Didn't even finish the game
[3:47:02] <%RetroCop87> so is ME4 set way after ME3?
[3:47:06] <%peachy996> Oh and turbofuck Gil and his friend
[3:47:11] <Latija> @Sp3ctre48 can't you bang her though
[3:47:13] <knight_verse> The Angara and the Kett are bar none the worse aliens, the Angara are shitty reverse Asari and the Kett are much less interesting Collectors.
[3:47:19] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @knight_verse Yeah but Andromeda was made by Bioware's D team, with a even ridiculous timeline, no suppervision and dealing with a engine they never ever touched. So of course they do fuck it up
[3:47:21] <%jillyrancher> the Dark energy shit Pat likes to go on about was really only brought up in one interview and a few super minor hints in ME2.
[3:47:29] <Sp3ctre48> @RetroCop87 Seems to take place soonish after ME3
[3:47:38] <%aWanderingKaivo> Kett are just bio borg
[3:47:44] <%RetroCop87> @Sp3ctre48 nnnnneat
[3:47:55] <+ThomasOfTroy> @knight_verse God, I WISH I had suppervision, that sounds sick
[3:47:58] <%peachy996> Like I said earlier I love the cobweb of shit plaguing Andromeda. But that's not a major thing like it should have been
[3:48:08] <Latija> the scrapped dark energy plot is confirmed
[3:48:14] <%peachy996> It's Dark Energy webs right?
[3:48:15] <%toolofparanoia> @RetroCop87 its in another galaxy after traveling there for thousands of years in cryo
[3:48:16] <Sp3ctre48> That's more ME2's fault for doing nothing with it's main plot tbh, Dark Energy could have been good, just like what they went with could have been good
[3:48:19] <theplayster> @jillyrancher they might touch it for ME4?
[3:48:23] <Latija> confirmed that it was where the story was going for me1/2
[3:48:23] <%hrbeck_> Meat vision
[3:48:28] <$ainzhelm> So we dont actually know whats going on with ME4. If they where smart they would say no fuck it we are just going to change the ME3 ending a little to allow for it. Like how Human Revolution invalidated your suicidal choices
[3:48:40] <%jillyrancher> I dont think it ever would have been good
[3:48:40] <%afronooch> yep
[3:48:49] <%afronooch> thats kinda the only way tbh.
[3:48:55] <knight_verse> @morcego_cinzento_arts Not a good enough excuse as to why they suck so much ass.
[3:49:17] <$ainzhelm> I want a stupid plot twist timeline where the reapers are stopped by something else and you get to play as old man shepherd dealing with whatever the fuck that is
[3:49:38] <%toolofparanoia> its so weird that there is going to be a mass effect 4 and i keep mistaking it with Andromeda... so stupid. I don't wanna be shepard though in the new game
[3:49:45] <%peachy996> It'd be cool if you could get Matriarch Liara killed in ME4
[3:49:50] <%aWanderingKaivo> imagine having a character creator where you can only make your character old, I'd be down
[3:49:50] <Sp3ctre48> We'll never know since they course corrected to the silly theme ME3 has to work with that ME2 didn't bother building up to
[3:50:01] <$ainzhelm> Maybe the prothean empire successfully hid themselves away in dark space and now you have to deal with there oppressive halo covenant shit
[3:50:05] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @knight_verse i know. My point was more towards that the Dark Energy idea is not a bad one. was just executed by idiots
[3:50:08] <%sweaty_weeb_> sweaty_weeb_ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months, currently on a 8 month streak! Howdy
[3:50:16] <%peachy996> But enough talk. Let's talk genres
[3:50:21] <RedPlasticCup> zangieeeeeeef
[3:50:24] <%shurtal> Once full dog, now empty, updates soon
[3:50:27] <%GarbageNirvana> That's how it works with me too
[3:50:40] <%Rumbutt> So you're saying by taking a shit Zangief dropped the weights like Rock Lee
[3:50:45] <%GarbageNirvana> No energy until I take a good dump and then suddenly I'm good to go
[3:50:47] <%NopeBadguy> I tried to hug the house cat and she bit the shit outta me :(
[3:51:02] <%NopeBadguy> Oh is the stream over?
[3:51:08] <%aWanderingKaivo> @GarbageNirvana less weight to lug around
[3:51:11] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @ainzhelm I imagine they going "actually the catalysm Ai was super buggy and talking out of it's ass"
[3:51:15] <%ChrisPlaysThing> YUP
[3:51:17] <%aWanderingKaivo> that sounds like a pretty stupid take
[3:51:24] <%peachy996> eh
[3:51:26] <28moogles> Let people look how they want?
[3:51:26] <+I4gotmyname89> hair color?
[3:51:29] <%jillyrancher> I can hug my German Shepherd all I want
[3:51:29] <DianaTheAscian> tends to work
[3:51:35] <Sp3ctre48> You can definitely tell a lot about a person looking at their haircut
[3:51:42] <%toolofparanoia> the stickers they put on the back of their car maybe
[3:51:44] <%GarbageNirvana> I mean bumper stickers maybe
[3:51:45] <%RetroCop87> YES
[3:51:46] <$ainzhelm> @morcego_cinzento_arts Well having shepherd dream/be indoc is that but simpler
[3:51:53] <cpt_langosta> vanity plates are the worst
[3:51:54] <Profmcstevie> People living their life like a fighting game character, carry their personalty on their everything
[3:51:54] <%ChrisPlaysThing> The Karen haircut became known for a reason
[3:51:56] <%Doctor_Death_Bed> Doctor_Death_Bed subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 52 months! 
[3:51:58] <%jillyrancher> I live in Missouri and yes. you can.
[3:52:00] <MiamiMemory> Doesn't matter what the bumper sticker is, it ALWAYS looks bad
[3:52:03] <%aWanderingKaivo> or maybe just don't assume things about people
[3:52:08] <%SveriSageAdvice> ive had customers come in with more offensive shirts than i have ever seen bumper stickers
[3:52:08] <$Futurecity10> Yes, I saw a car at my local gas station that had a "Fuck you, you fucking fuck", As soon as I walk in I see two over weight people broth with dyed hair and it was their car
[3:52:08] <%Ravioli_Ronin> Bumper stickers are cringe confirmed
[3:52:08] <+kewlmyc> I think they're tacky as hell.
[3:52:15] <@Ranryu692> @PatStaresAt would you judge a politician for listing Janeway as their favorite STar Trek captain?
[3:52:16] <%AzureGale> snuffOmegalul
[3:52:17] <%aWanderingKaivo> based on superficial shit
[3:52:26] <%SaiyanShoto> I love my fat yoshi car sticker
[3:52:35] <%peachy996> Poor Kate Mulgrew
[3:52:35] <Virokwet> LUL
[3:52:36] <%AncelDeLambert> he flop
[3:52:44] <%Ravioli_Ronin> The stupider the bumper sticker the better
[3:52:47] <%toolofparanoia> hair color no, people who talk about hair color need to get their head out of their ass
[3:52:48] <%AncelDeLambert> no but father you may not have the toy
[3:52:52] <%GarbageNirvana> "I refuse father"
[3:52:53] <%PlainSimpleTailor> @Ranryu692 I know I would
[3:52:53] <cpt_langosta> FATHER MUST NEVER HAVE TOY
[3:52:59] <%peachy996> She tried her best with the crapgarbage the writers gave her
[3:53:05] <%jillyrancher> Anyone with a huge flag in the back of thier pick up flapping in the wind as they drive are fucking assholes. I see that so much here. @patstaresat
[3:53:06] <%ChrisPlaysThing> LUL
[3:53:07] <%NopeBadguy> big and strong
[3:53:08] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @ainzhelm would be extra funny and scummy if Bioware used the Indoc theory to  justify ME4 when in the past they hard denied that theory
[3:53:09] <%afronooch> D:
[3:53:09] <%NopeBadguy> what happened
[3:53:09] <AngryAsian5> F
