[0:37:48] <mankeyfigh> I AM AN ADUUUUUULT
[0:37:48] <%theAncopro> Pat's being objectified
[0:37:52] <+DesertPenguin> You never see your character so it doesn't really matter. I really wish there were more opportunities to see your character
[0:37:55] <Zaphire_Saucypants> the fetchiest of quests this is.

[0:40:34] <%doc_ock_rokc> NOT ENOUGH
[0:40:34] <%Rumbutt> Not enough
[0:40:35] <trianglehat> not enough
[0:40:35] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Is there a scientific term for the kind of classist kink this saleswoman seems to have? Surely Freud must've written something on it
[0:40:37] <%Ynkubus18> Not enough
[0:40:37] <RagingLeo> not enough
[0:40:38] <%sporeian94> Somone's gonna do a supercut now
[0:40:41] <%Bluwizard21> @angriestpat I've noticed that despite the long hair I dont see much shedding on Pat's cloths
[0:40:48] <%JetpackMcQuack> Go back to Elmo
[0:40:51] <%dekkitout> LUL
[0:40:53] <+ClaudeMcGarren> you make us very uncomfortable pat LUL

[0:41:07] <%bevyrage> i like this one
[0:41:07] <Zaphire_Saucypants> hah
[0:41:08] <+DesertPenguin> @bluwizard21 it's white hair so it won't show up that much from a distance
[0:41:14] <%Alpha8087> Answer to percentage hanging out with Elmo: Yes.
[0:41:23] <%thenumber5point5> pat, its a good quest but can take alot of time if you dont have all the gear yet.. it up to you but can derail the stream for the one quest
[0:41:23] <%JetpackMcQuack> Help her smash LUL
[0:41:25] <ミュウレ4242> i heard "butt-monger autist".
[0:41:27] <%MelBrooksKA> So that's why Plague is so good at that
[0:41:31] <Nina96> u should do more just chatting streams pat @AngriestPat
[0:41:36] <%AncelDeLambert> are we gonna cook Parvati for a gang of cannibals?
[0:41:45] <BeefyQueefer> this outfit looks fucking awful
[0:41:46] <%Seraphile> Celeste is one of my favourite characters
[0:41:52] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Licensing and copyright?
[0:41:53] <KingGoblodyte> COPYWRITE?
[0:41:54] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Aww I like that Cheesytot's getting a makeover tho
[0:42:01] <%AncelDeLambert> yes
[0:42:02] <Nina96> yes
[0:42:08] <+DesertPenguin> Bitch are you fo' real?!
[0:42:08] <%AncelDeLambert> BS ALARM BS ALARM
[0:42:13] <%Tearonex> SHE'S JUST THAT GOOD
[0:42:13] <%sporeian94> 44DD
[0:42:18] <lesbianmimikyu> do it for LOOOVE
[0:42:20] <Nina96> sounds like bullshit but i believe it
[0:42:31] <%AncelDeLambert> smack her
[0:42:31] <+DesertPenguin> Bitch....
[0:42:36] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> The brain chemicals, lol
[0:42:37] <%Alpha8087> This got dark.
[0:42:37] <%AncelDeLambert> BITCH I HAVE A GUN
[0:42:41] <%Rumbutt> Love is so... last season
[0:42:46] <%torontototoro> She's not wrong. Parvati is a precious little cinnamon roll
[0:42:49] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Pay her, then beat her ass
[0:42:50] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Is celeste just Woolie
[0:42:52] <%Ner234> 50% That's ... nice
[0:42:54] <%AncelDeLambert> I'm modeling for YOU, fuck you, pay me
[0:42:54] <+DesertPenguin> You can talk it down to 2000 with enough skill
[0:42:55] <%senfood> I agree with her but she made Parvati pout so she gets the blade.
[0:43:02] <%misha_kastrilevich> SOMEBODY'S GONNA GET STABBED!
[0:43:06] <%GarbageNirvana> From shab to fab
[0:43:12] <%Huntercd> I would love to measure Parvati
[0:43:13] <%bevyrage> this better go great with the moon mask
[0:43:17] <%Tearonex> I LOVE CELES
[0:43:24] <%Seraphile> celeste <3
[0:43:38] <%senfood> Ok, you've redeemed yourself, Celeste.
[0:43:39] <Nina96> nope
[0:43:43] <%InugamiTheHound> big lesbo vibes
[0:43:45] <%torontototoro> I still find it odd they went with the southern-ish folksy accent for a character named Parvati. The south asian accent stuck on Sanjar
[0:43:49] <lesbianmimikyu> the ladies love parvati
[0:43:50] <%Soulbishop> So she trying to fuck? Or nah?
[0:43:51] <mankeyfigh> @AngriestPat You know she's lying to you because NO ONE would ever hire you to be a model with that MOON HELMET
[0:43:51] <%bevyrage> HAT!
[0:43:53] <$Yakobro> SHADES
[0:43:54] <%alphonseisbest> everyone be hitting on PARPAR
[0:44:01] <%Razputin217> TOP HAT
[0:44:01] <%AncelDeLambert> I ended New Vegas wanting to bang Cassidy like a steel drum. Ain't none of these characters giving me the vapors
[0:44:02] <%Soulbishop> How can you love an asexual being
[0:44:11] <%honeyman18> I'm a little disappointed people on Byzanthium arent comically assholish.
[0:44:12] <%Seraphile> @torontototoro her mum named her, and she never met her
[0:44:19] <%senfood> Moon Gang already has top hats.
[0:44:21] <+DesertPenguin> Parvati is asexual because of the death stranding
[0:44:23] <+ClaudeMcGarren> @AncelDeLambert you must be crazy saying none cmonBruh
[0:44:23] <ミュウレ4242> Soulbishop, perhaps up the butt.
[0:44:24] <%bevyrage> @Soulbishop you love 'em for something beyond their body, that's how
[0:44:28] <%dekkitout> @AncelDeLambert Sadly, I agree
[0:44:40] <%AncelDeLambert> @ClaudeMcGarren I couldn't get Nyoka because of a bug
[0:44:42] <Storm_Samurai> Buy the best armor
[0:44:43] <%torontototoro> @Seraphile good point, though I wonder where she picked up the southern? Reed?
[0:44:46] <%dekkitout> Wait- no, Max gives me the same feeling
[0:44:52] <Zaphire_Saucypants> it's a quest item
[0:44:57] <BeefyQueefer> quest item
[0:45:02] <%sporeian94> @Soulbishop No clue how any of this sex stuff works anymore. To quote Grandpa Simpson "I use to be with it, but then they changed what it was"
[0:45:04] <%marsanta> You have to equip it and talk to her wearing it all
[0:45:05] <Zebroneath> You need the full set, hlemet included
[0:45:37] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Celeste <3
[0:45:40] <Storm_Samurai> It needs to say marauder armor in description
[0:45:40] <%Bluwizard21> you need spacers normal wear not armor.
[0:45:44] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Now what I'm with isn't it, and what' it seems weird and scary to me. It'll happen to YOU
[0:45:45] <%Ner234> No longer Moon Gang FeelsBadMan
[0:46:00] <%torontototoro> has Pat done the retirement or movie quest yet?
[0:46:01] <%dekkitout> When'd he cop an eyepatch
[0:46:04] <+ClaudeMcGarren> @AncelDeLambert for me its the outlaw leader cassandra with the scars she make pp happ Kreygasm
[0:46:06] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Does she seriously want you to show her the worst possible outfits?
[0:46:08] <%TheTakkster> That's just a quick visit to marvin
[0:46:10] <%lotharrio> She specifically called out she didn't want you to wear Spacer's Choice stuff.
[0:46:14] <%JustToWatch> @AngriestPat if it says "spacer" in the description you're good
[0:46:15] <Ion_Laser> Ahh my knees!
[0:46:21] <%Tearonex> @AngriestPat for the spacer's stuff its anything that has spacer in the description, NOT spacer's choice shit
[0:46:22] <%Bane_Kaikyo> geezus
[0:46:23] <+DesertPenguin> Is the story up to the point of no return?
[0:46:33] <%Nobrev> I think for space you just need anything that isnt spacers choice
[0:46:38] <%Razputin217> Does he even HAVE legs at this point?
[0:46:39] <Zaphire_Saucypants> @DesertPenguin not yet
[0:46:42] <Zebroneath> @DesertPenguin Not yet
[0:46:44] <%Seraphile> has pat done early retirement yet?
[0:46:46] <%Tearonex> Nah you gotta fins it
[0:46:51] <+DesertPenguin> Okay, so definitely not gonna finish tonight. I saw how many other side quests there were
[0:46:54] <Zebroneath> He just got to Byzantium
[0:46:57] <Zaphire_Saucypants> @Seraphile nope
[0:46:58] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat has broken stumps in game, just like in real life
[0:47:04] <%Bane_Kaikyo> vineSchut vineSchut vineSchut
[0:47:07] <%AncelDeLambert> @AngriestPat your character is now Cotton Hill
[0:47:11] <%torontototoro> would love to see Pat do early retirement, hope I didn't miss it
[0:47:12] <BeefyQueefer> give cheesycrotch the dress
[0:47:13] <+ClaudeMcGarren> yes
[0:47:14] <%Seraphile> honestly I just hope for early retirement tonight
[0:47:15] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> lewd
[0:47:15] <OvaltineDream> yes
[0:47:18] <%Ner234> Wow what a slut
[0:47:19] <%Seraphile> let alone finish the game
[0:47:21] <%sporeian94> Early Retirement is just a tame version of that one fucked up vault from NV
[0:47:23] <Psyramics> "Revel in my glory, peasant"
[0:47:24] <%dekkitout> Eh, a little
[0:47:25] <TheMorilo> It's better if you don't even try to do this modeling quest
[0:47:27] <+DesertPenguin> Before the endgame you should respec to min/max what you're gonna use in the final battle
[0:47:28] <%JetpackMcQuack> Yes but you won't
[0:47:35] <%Jrocy247> Did Pat see the Woolie Cows yet?
[0:47:39] <mankeyfigh> FUCKING DOIT
[0:47:39] <%GarbageQueenEllie> If Parvati was a dude, we'd call him Cheesestick
[0:47:45] <Lurantis_> That boarst wurst ad makes me cringe every single time I see it’s weird tumors
[0:47:47] <OvaltineDream> GET IN THERE PARVATI
[0:47:47] <+DesertPenguin> HE got the Woolie Cows early on. I never got them once!
[0:47:51] <%AncelDeLambert> I swear to god, girl, if you dragged me all across the system just to get shut down SO HELP ME
[0:47:51] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Parvati <3
[0:47:52] <mankeyfigh> nononononononononononononononononon

[1:38:35] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> @Jrocy247 body disposal needs a proper form filled out and to be approved by the bureau
[1:38:36] <flyingavocad0s> @angriestpat those guards just watch if you kill celestes murderers
[1:38:43] <%sporeian94> PRON TIME
[1:38:51] <+HyraFukit> @AngriestPat What's your favorite DnD/Pathfinder race?
[1:38:53] <%linkster291> Simple Pat, they hate the poor people so much they don't want to give them jobs to fix things.
[1:38:59] <Zaphire_Saucypants> save
[1:39:03] <BeefyQueefer> save
[1:39:04] <%sporeian94> D&D but worse
[1:39:08] <%doc_ock_rokc> Gnome
[1:39:08] <lesbianmimikyu> it's legally distinct dnd
[1:39:09] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> There's your answer
[1:39:10] <Calek> Pathfinder is off brand DnD
[1:39:11] <%sporeian94> like discount D&D I'm told
[1:39:12] <%Alpha8087> @AngriestPat Thank you for saying that.
[1:39:14] <%marsanta> A fun RPG game, you'd like it. Don't stream it
[1:39:14] <tigerfang86> off brand DND
[1:39:15] <eltigre1296> D&D but better
[1:39:15] <+NopeBadguy> Pathfinder is a system based a lot more on 3.5e DnD @AngriestPat
[1:39:17] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Pathfinder is made by people who made D&D 3rd ed
[1:39:17] <%televisedrevolting> Kenku
[1:39:19] <%TDAWS_MP132> that tells you everything you need to know, tbh
[1:39:20] <%Razputin217> Doing this quest as a BIG DUMB was really funny
[1:39:20] <akaSiggy> @AngriestPat Pathfinder is basically DND 3.5 but better
[1:39:21] <+HyraFukit> Pathfinder is just 3.5e if it was beter. @AngriestPat
[1:39:22] <%Alpha8087> Also its basically 3.5++
[1:39:23] <ShichiNoBushi> D&D 3.75 essentially.
[1:39:24] <SpaceGuntank> its the spacer's choice version of DnD
[1:39:27] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @sporeian94 Appropriate, then, that they call you that in Andromeda
[1:39:28] <%InugamiTheHound> black casting couch
[1:39:28] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> D&D but Paladins only use bows for some fucking reson
[1:39:28] <%Maids4lyfe> it's a traditional rpg
[1:39:29] <%SGrim> @AngriestPat Pathfinder is Pepsi DnD
[1:39:31] <%cureneckbeard> Patfinder
[1:39:33] <Geno4344> does this game have sex mods yet
[1:39:34] <%bevyrage> pathfinder is D&D 3.75 in effect, and they released second edition during summer
[1:39:38] <DocMadfox> DnD 3.75
[1:39:40] <Graxe_> Be natural

[1:39:56] <%sporeian94> I played 1 round of D&D and then the DM got arrested for selling drugs and the group disbanned
[1:39:57] <Graxe_> They want authenticity

[1:46:08] <+Maldoree> some shelters do at certain seasons
[1:46:09] <+NopeBadguy> My friend who owns a cat they adopted off the street turned around in shock until realizing "wait, i got my cat for free" @AngriestPat

[2:30:57] <@StridentSong> That's just a sprat, pat
[2:31:01] <%CrabSlacks> be careful pat it might explode
[2:31:02] <butthurtdave> I just realized that there's no Unarmed in this game! First Todd screwed us out of it in Skyrim, now Obsidian denies me once again!
[2:31:09] <%Jrocy247> I wish Scylla wasn't so small...
[2:31:13] <@StridentSong> They have regional variants
[2:31:16] <+Macbutters86> Hey patterooski
[2:31:22] <%marsanta> Wrong elevator
[2:31:27] <tigerfang86> RUSED
[2:31:27] <%GarbageNirvana> It's an Alolan sprat
[2:31:28] <%Alpha8087> Knowing they are called sprats I just imagined the rugrats babies crawling all over the place.
[2:31:31] <tigerfang86> BAMBOOZLED

[2:31:53] <sniffy77> i want snowy space planet
[2:31:54] <shiny_prinny> hell no
[2:31:54] <Sol_Install> yep
[2:31:56] <%joylent_blue> at least in skyrim you could punch people if you wanted, in this game your hands don't exist unless they're holding a weapon
[2:31:57] <%Seraphile> no
[2:31:57] <butthurtdave> Nah, Black and White still hold the W
[2:31:57] <%cvp5127> lol no
[2:31:58] <KishinGrek> Ruby is
[2:31:58] <caprine_sun> I liked oras the most
[2:31:59] <Jflaskd13> Heart gold and Soul silver are the best
[2:31:59] <Fujiwara_92> No
[2:32:00] <BigNerdSam> The best Pokemon games were Gen 5. They had triple battles.
[2:32:01] <%Seraphile> BW2 & HGSS
[2:32:02] <Sol_Install> wait no
[2:32:02] <%Animorphimagi> no. Still Pokemon Silver
[2:32:03] <NoWayRyanTatum> Ultra is worse than regular Sun and Moon
[2:32:04] <%InugamiTheHound> what about gold/silver?
[2:32:04] <%mostly_simple> Gen 4
[2:32:05] <tigerfang86> BW2
[2:32:05] <Sol_Install> ORAS are the best
[2:32:08] <%genowyn> HGSS is best
[2:32:08] <%GarbageQueenEllie> the best pokemon game is the last one
[2:32:09] <Prism_Wing> Gold and Silver are the best Pokémon games.
[2:32:09] <Gregorhasjoined> No, that's still gold
[2:32:09] <NeetKiller> S/M are good
[2:32:10] <moosemonkey397> HGSS are easily the best
[2:32:11] <%marsanta> Eh, sword and shield might be ok after the inevitable DLC
[2:32:12] <Fujiwara_92> Gen 4 probly
[2:32:14] <HyperBomb21> HG SS is the best
[2:32:15] <%joylent_blue> Ultra sun and moon are trash
[2:32:18] <+Macbutters86> Pat, wish this immigrant good luck for his Canadian public service job interview on Friday?
[2:32:19] <BlacSoul> Platinum
[2:32:20] <ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Yes
[2:32:20] <@commanderclaw> Sword and Shield sold super well, so nothing's gonna change
[2:32:21] <%Ynkubus18> that was bait chat
[2:32:21] <flyingavocad0s> Colosseum best
[2:32:21] <tigerfang86> GEN 5 CREW
[2:32:21] <Taffer85> wtf
[2:32:22] <+SuperMonkey2> lewd
[2:32:23] <DocMadfox> Silver is my favorite
[2:32:23] <KishinGrek> Ruby is the best pokemon
[2:32:25] <%dekkitout> ADA PLEASE
[2:32:27] <%marsanta> Black and white 2 was horrible
[2:32:27] <%cureneckbeard> Sword/Shield is still awesome ok. WAH BUT MY TREE TEXTURE
[2:32:28] <BigNerdSam> Yeah, instead of having Pokemon Grey, they had Pokemon Black and White 2.
[2:32:28] <butthurtdave> Yeah, first sequels ever, they were revolutionary for the series
[2:32:29] <%Seraphile> BW2 was better mechanically
[2:32:30] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> LEWD
[2:32:31] <%connos_procrastination> PogChamp
[2:32:32] <KishinGrek> Woah
[2:32:32] <%Jrocy247> HGSS is the real one

[2:32:39] <%Ner234> Wow
[2:32:41] <+KingOfTheGeats> BW2 has a nice endgame
[2:32:41] <butthurtdave> I'M STILL MAD WE DIDNT GET Z VERSION TO FIX X/Y'S STUPID BULLSHIT
[2:32:41] <loskotukha> TALK DIRTY TO ME revNoot revNoot revNoot revNoot revNoot revNoot revNoot
[2:32:42] <%R3Roundabout> The best Pokemon game is the Smogon simulator that includes all the best content with none of the grting
[2:32:46] <%Alpha8087> Ruby Sapphire introduced my man Metagross so I guess that wins in my book.
[2:32:48] <Jeemukun> she wants the robo dick
[2:32:51] <IncredibleMeh> THE SHIP AND THE ROBOT ARE FUCKING
[2:32:52] <%supercasualboom> What about Pokémon Bitches and Hoes!?!?!
[2:32:53] <%Soulbishop> that loading screen was really similar to void bastard's art
[2:32:53] <%Alpha8087> Or the newer pairing
[2:33:00] <shiny_prinny> of all the scummy ripoffs, ultra sun and moon is gamefreaks worst
[2:33:03] <Zaphire_Saucypants> it's almost like they WANT you to die
[2:33:09] <%Alpha8087> Omega Ruby/Alpha Sapphire?
[2:33:11] <Prism_Wing> That computer face looked like the crutches kid from South Park LUL
[2:33:13] <loskotukha> The other place was closer
[2:33:14] <%dekkitout> Didn't gen 5 have 152 original pokemon
[2:33:19] <butthurtdave> 154
[2:33:38] <ape_hawk> sword and shield is fine
[2:33:40] <+Okosisi89> It's fine, It's just pokemon
[2:33:43] <Nina96> but than the thing happend
[2:33:44] <+FoolsArcade> Im having fun with it
[2:33:44] <%dekkitout> Fuck me I need to nuzelock that

[2:33:45] <tigerfang86> it's just pokemon
[2:33:47] <%Tearonex> were you? LUL
[2:33:47] <Zaphire_Saucypants> so did I. I was hoping that it would be the thing to get me back into pokemon.
[2:33:47] <%Alpha8087> All my favs are gone :I
[2:33:49] <tigerfang86> it's regular pokemon
[2:33:49] <ape_hawk> YOU WERENT GOING TO CATCH SHIT
[2:33:50] <%WackyGear> @AngriestPat its fine
[2:33:50] <%marsanta> It's better than I thought it'd be, it just lacks pokemon which is shit
[2:33:51] <Mogel56> it is good people are fickle
[2:33:51] <%Animorphimagi> looked bad from trailer 1
[2:33:51] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> DOUBT
[2:33:52] <%snow_bush> That's a lie
[2:33:53] <%cureneckbeard> it's pokemon
[2:33:53] <%Jay_Squirrel> the monkey that gets a gun
[2:33:55] <+FoolsArcade> its a solid game,
[2:33:58] <DarkSideCow> its super good
[2:34:00] <KishinGrek> So if we get abetter version of Sword and shield will it be Hammer or Paladin?
[2:34:01] <%honeyman18> That's fine
[2:34:02] <%cureneckbeard> it's the TREE TEXTURES
[2:34:02] <Fujiwara_92> Just do it, the game is fine
[2:34:02] <+Okosisi89> It's disappointing, but literally every pokemon since Ruby has been.
[2:34:03] <%cvp5127> LUL
[2:34:04] <%mostly_simple> LUL
[2:34:10] <Lurantis_> I have sword and so far I love it
[2:34:16] <+King_floppy> man I wanna play Soul Silver again now
[2:34:20] <%marsanta> They 100% will, they are in data, it's just marketing for DLC
[2:34:20] <%cureneckbeard> pat there are over 1000 pokemons
[2:34:23] <+griffball13> @AngriestPat they should have just started with a new roster
[2:34:24] <%Nobrev> they're fine. I'm enjoying myself quite a bit but there are a lot of qol things
[2:34:25] <%dekkitout> Does pat know about the multiple models of the same character stored per map area in gen 7?
[2:34:27] <+Mr_Pylon> Pat did you ever keep them between games?
[2:34:28] <Taffer85> cant catch em all ever again FeelsBadMan
[2:34:29] <lesbianmimikyu> pat are you telling me you bring all your pokemon farward to every new game
[2:34:30] <%Valdorick> The game has defeated Pat's Mindgoblins, and in doing so, have removed a cutsomer from their base.
[2:34:32] <%honeyman18> I just wanna make a team outta food
[2:34:32] <%Alpha8087> I was fine with not having them in the game but nationa ldex them in via onlien trades and junk
[2:34:32] <%cureneckbeard> old games made you play minigames to trade them over six at a time
[2:34:33] <%supercasualboom> Pat doesn’t like curry
[2:34:33] <%Sadira_snack_attack> Its fun...but its actually my first Pokémon game ever
[2:34:37] <Sol_Install> Yeah
[2:34:37] <BlindGato> Gotta catch em all!.........with EXCEPTIONS
[2:34:43] <butthurtdave> That's just Masuda lying through his teeth, they fucked up with Sw/Sh's model importer and if they admitted that was the reason why they're not bringing them all back then they'd look like incompetent douchebags
[2:34:44] <@commanderclaw> This is like if Magic the Gathering came to your house and stole your cards
[2:34:44] <%goose_attack_almanac> @AngriestPat Would you ever play the Gamecube games by Genius Sonority?
[2:34:45] <%GarbageQueenEllie> I also agree. Transformers that shit
[2:34:45] <Paperware> The point is the pokemans we caught along the way
[2:34:48] <KishinGrek> Modellng is hard gais
[2:34:50] <%InugamiTheHound> RIP scottish pokemon Trainer. Her and scorbunny will live in hearts thanks to all rule 34 porn of them.
[2:34:50] <loskotukha> Do must people ever give a shit about catching them all
[2:34:51] <%Jay_Squirrel> but @AngriestPat what about CHARIZARD
[2:34:51] <%cureneckbeard> No because people would be like BUT MY PIKACHUS
[2:34:51] <%goose_attack_almanac> New Roster! Like Black and White
[2:34:51] <%RedKnightVI> Yeah but Pikachu tho
[2:34:52] <ape_hawk> bullshit, people woulda complained even harder
[2:34:53] <BigNerdSam> Yeah, that's real silly now. The whole appeal of Pokemon was being an RPG where you can carry the same party between game generations.
[2:34:54] <DarkSideCow> it plays real good and you ca finish the dexs in this games dex
[2:34:54] <%marsanta> They want that big marketing buzz that new coke got
[2:34:55] <Zebroneath> The prospect of not being able to carry over is very disappointing
[2:34:57] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> But Pikachu
[2:35:03] <%marsanta> And they'll get it and people will pay them
[2:35:05] <%Alpha8087> Blastoise man
[2:35:06] <%joylent_blue> it looks as dumbed down as other recent entries have been
[2:35:06] <BigNerdSam> Fuck Charizard
[2:35:07] <Nina96> if the never them have all again ill prob never touch pokemon again
[2:35:11] <DocMadfox> Fuck you, Charizard's great
[2:35:13] <HyperBomb21> Fuck you I want my charizard
[2:35:13] <BigNerdSam> When's Pikachu 5?
[2:35:14] <%joylent_blue> too many tutorials
[2:35:14] <+FoolsArcade> I like charizard, but fuck charizard
[2:35:15] <%cvp5127> all charizard
[2:35:16] <%joylent_blue> too much talking
[2:35:18] <DocMadfox> Fuck you
[2:35:18] <%supercasualboom> What about Guzzlord!?!?!
[2:35:21] <%deviljhojho_> nice bruv
[2:35:21] <%dekkitout> Why can't the gen 2 starters get that much love...
[2:35:23] <%Seraphile> what about gengar
[2:35:23] <+FoolsArcade> Charizard isn't even a dragon type
[2:35:24] <loskotukha> I never gave a shit about more than 12 Pokemon in each game since I was like 9
[2:35:24] <%Valdorick> ... Ass dick?
[2:35:25] <%Ner234> Your what?
[2:35:28] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Pat is dickbutt confirmed
[2:35:29] <Sol_Install> charizard is fucking annoying now
[2:35:29] <Nina96> fuck charaziard
[2:35:29] <HyperBomb21> If it doesnt ahve charizard, it's not a pokemon game
[2:35:30] <%goose_attack_almanac> Remember @AngriestPat, the three most popular pokemon in the Galar region ARENT EVEN FROM THE GALAR REGION
[2:35:30] <%Dylveryn> Fuck that red lizard
[2:35:32] <%InugamiTheHound> "ass dick?"
[2:35:32] <%Alpha8087> say Is that Dickbutts cousin
[2:35:33] <butthurtdave> Pat, it's not so bad. For a yearly fee, you can transfer your Pokemon to Pokemon Home, where they can live forever until they make a new game that actually uses them. Isn't that great!
[2:35:33] <KishinGrek> Your dickbutt
[2:35:34] <%Emperor_Machinus> Charizard is the worst

[2:36:07] <%genowyn> It always kills you there
[2:36:08] <%Alpha8087> Man you need robot legs
[2:36:08] <+Okosisi89> My legs are ok!
[2:36:10] <%CrabSlacks> they just shot out of your sholders
[2:36:12] <ianabstract> the old crunchy leg
[2:36:13] <shiny_prinny> it's like, why buy the next game in a series with minimal improvements, when i can check back in 4 games later
[2:36:14] <%deviljhojho_> this guy is almost geralt levels of fall damage
[2:36:14] <%InugamiTheHound> talk shit about charizard, get fucked!
[2:36:16] <DocMadfox> Because you were shit talking Charizard like a punk ass bitch
[2:36:17] <butthurtdave> HAMMER TIME
[2:36:17] <%AncelDeLambert> drop, LUL
[2:36:18] <+vicar_anat> what is this? boomer bones?
[2:36:19] <%GarbageQueenEllie> If I don't get to upload my waifus, neither can the pokemon fans
[2:36:22] <stagnetti> Dont do it
[2:36:23] <EuropanLamprey> Your shins shot into your chest
[2:36:24] <%AncelDeLambert> ham ham

[2:36:29] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat god FUCKING DAMN IT! So My boss told me I got hired but no paperwork came though so now I don't know if I am evenhired
[2:36:33] <%AncelDeLambert> LUL
[2:36:35] <Nina96> i cant wait till they add some fusion bullshit and charizard becomes a water type @AngriestPat
[2:36:36] <KishinGrek> Savescum
[2:36:45] <DarkSideCow> but can this stop before i leave again
[2:36:45] <%AncelDeLambert> Get thrown off Olympus, get rekt
[2:36:48] <%mostly_simple> LUL
[2:36:50] <%marsanta> Pat! WATCH OUT!
[2:36:54] <+Imn0tacop> PAt: Jumps off a mountain. Also Pat: How did I die?
[2:36:56] <%MrChapwhit> odd... out-of-bounds I guess
[2:37:03] <%Jay_Squirrel> pull the ground up to you
[2:37:05] <%joylent_blue> don't you just love killboxes
[2:37:07] <%CrabSlacks> watch out for that cliff pat, don't trip
[2:37:09] <lesbianmimikyu> see that mountain? you can climb it
[2:37:13] <loskotukha> USE THE HAMMER
[2:37:13] <%GarbageQueenEllie> If only you had hover boots
[2:37:14] <%dekkitout> And so, Patron cast himself from the highest point in Monarch
[2:37:14] <%dalmek> it's purely for the Hammer of Olympus to look cool
[2:37:15] <butthurtdave> I gotta admit i was suprised to see this in the running for GOTY
[2:37:18] <%InugamiTheHound> god this monster and its weird holes are so nasty
[2:37:18] <%supercasualboom> You could say that’s outer limits...
[2:37:19] <%tizz86> !uptime
[2:37:19] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 37m.
[2:37:20] <%Razputin217> Jump off the Throat of the World
[2:37:43] <%tizz86> what'd i miss
[2:37:51] <braydenlikestea> Pat, how would you compare this game's combat to New Vegas in terms of difficulty?
[2:37:52] <Nina96> wait pat what was your fav pokemon?
[2:37:57] <Taffer85> even on hardest setting youre practically immortal by this part
[2:38:01] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @Razputin217 I loved using the etheral shout to make jumping down the mountain effortless
[2:38:03] <CurrySauseBandit> Nothin is really balanced outside of Super Nova, and even that's pretty easy to run through.
[2:38:07] <%R3Roundabout> wait until you get to the ultra weapons tier
[2:38:08] <Zaphire_Saucypants> yeah shoot dem space dogs, Ellie.
[2:38:11] <moosemonkey397> have you not found a t3 aka 'Ultra' weapon pat?
[2:38:14] <butthurtdave> Oh hey Pat, dunno if you ever found out but if you hit R3 on your unique weapons you can see what their special perks are
[2:38:37] <%cmdrmobium> this game has a U shaped difficulty curve
[2:38:40] <%Marpolo13> earthlike?
[2:38:45] <%Ner234> "Earthlike"
[2:38:46] <vaderxyz1970> Is the game even fun at this point?
[2:38:46] <tigerfang86> TRIUMPH
[2:38:57] <%Jrocy247> EARTHLIKE????
[2:38:58] <Taffer85> @vaderxyz1970 no
[2:39:04] <KishinGrek> H A T
[2:39:04] <%cmdrmobium> the end sequence gets pretty hard on high difficulty
[2:39:08] <%Nobrev> HAT TIME HAT TIME
[2:39:14] <tigerfang86> GET THE HAT, GET THE HAT
[2:39:17] <loskotukha> @vaderxyz1970 Yeah that's kinda why he's playing it and we're watching it
[2:39:17] <%joylent_blue> i was loving this game until about the halfway point
[2:39:23] <PunishedMercer_> hat time hat crime
[2:39:28] <Zaphire_Saucypants> so after this, Ellie or Aliens?
[2:39:30] <KishinGrek> Hyat
[2:39:32] <%joylent_blue> started steadily getting colder on it
[2:39:35] <+Baderati> @cmdrmobium it sure does. Just played it last night. Reaaallly rough.
[2:39:39] <KishinGrek> Hayt
[2:39:48] <vaderxyz1970> Yah but hes one shotting everything
[2:39:49] <LixFury> It was front loaded
[2:39:52] <stagnetti> Do you really want a bell curve for quality anyway?
[2:39:52] <%Daniel_Is_I> This game is very front loaded
[2:40:00] <%connos_procrastination> Its just generic af
[2:40:00] <HyperBomb21> Yeah this game really falls off. Just like Pillars of Eternity
[2:40:10] <moosemonkey397> rosewater is devent, but edgewater is SO good
[2:40:10] <butthurtdave> I wish that the Perks were better. So many are zzz and there's like no incentive to take Flaws to get more perks
[2:40:10] <%joylent_blue> oh wow really
[2:40:13] <Zaphire_Saucypants> yeah...I agree.
[2:40:14] <KishinGrek> Oh really?
[2:40:15] <%honeyman18> This game feels half done, like they wanted way more to add to the game.
[2:40:16] <%joylent_blue> good on that guy
[2:40:20] <DocMadfox> @HyperBomb21 Wait, really? I liked PoE1 until the end
[2:40:21] <butthurtdave> Fast Travel pat
[2:40:22] <lesbianmimikyu> pat just fast travel to the plaza this elevator is so slow
[2:40:29] <%InugamiTheHound> @AngriestPat did you see that yakuza games will his xb1 via gamepass??
[2:40:31] <DocMadfox> But yeah, Byzantium is where the game nose dives for me
[2:40:31] <sniffy77> monarch took a while to beat. kinda dragged
[2:40:34] <Graxe_> I heard there was gonna be a side plot about corporate espionage.
[2:40:35] <ape_hawk> think is, most players only play the first couple hours of thjeir games
[2:40:36] <%CrabSlacks> would you feel this way if you had to think more about combat
[2:40:37] <HyperBomb21> @DocMadfox I was into it until the end of Act 2
[2:40:37] <ape_hawk> so, yeah
[2:40:38] <KishinGrek> Lol
[2:40:38] <shiny_prinny> maybe wanted to get this game out before next gen consoles?
[2:40:40] <%deviljhojho_> This is no goty but at least it was good
[2:40:41] <Graxe_> But that got dropped.
[2:40:41] <loskotukha> Finished a dumb science play through it was fun till the last half of the endgame
[2:40:43] <%dekkitout> Fast travel and subtext are for wimps
[2:40:45] <LeauxAyeQueue> Its difficult to apprecuate it without thinking of what coudlve been with deeper pockets
[2:40:45] <%Seraphile> PoE1 suffered from kicstarter dictated pacing
[2:40:47] <%AllyBeeBoo> it get's super boring fast, after realising most of the places look the same and there's hardly any weapons
[2:40:51] <tigerfang86> this game is like
[2:40:55] <tigerfang86> a solid game
[2:40:56] <+griffball13> @AngriestPat does the novilty where off
[2:40:56] <%dalmek> you kinda get "used to it" so to speak
[2:40:57] <%doc_ock_rokc> alll consuming
[2:41:00] <%Daniel_Is_I> Byzantium doesn't live up to the hype, which is the worst thing.
[2:41:01] <gildor0> even on hard this game got pretty easy after emerald vale I never felt in danger till the last mission
[2:41:01] <tigerfang86> not an amazing one
[2:41:05] <%dalmek> it's hard to be surprised by anything
[2:41:06] <DocMadfox> Byzantium killed my enjoyment because the exploration is really stymied
[2:41:07] <Nina96> yeah
[2:41:09] <butthurtdave> It also doesn't help that the Board is a largely faceless villain
[2:41:13] <%Animorphimagi> dont talk about theme Pat. You aren't at the end
[2:41:14] <Zaphire_Saucypants> ehhhh
[2:41:16] <Zaphire_Saucypants> there's a good one here
[2:41:20] <%InugamiTheHound> I think humor and themes are bit annoying and gets stale real easily
[2:41:21] <Vindicato> I couldn't stand the aesthetic of the game personally.
[2:41:22] <+KingOfTheGeats> seems like they ran out of budget at Byzantium
[2:41:22] <+BigCoffee> What about Moonman
[2:41:26] <Zaphire_Saucypants> a good corporate nightmare thing on this planet
[2:41:30] <KishinGrek> Yeah it stops
[2:41:32] <%SwdVengeance> MSI not being a bunch of assholes is a nice twist, but doesn't do enough
[2:41:36] <%Animorphimagi> Edgewater isn't THE POINT of the game
[2:41:37] <%Marpolo13> lol
[2:41:41] <Sol_Install> LUL
[2:41:43] <KishinGrek> Hat now
[2:41:44] <%Nobrev> wheres my hat bitch
[2:41:46] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> Edgewater definitely had the best world-building. But it's still an amazing game.
[2:41:47] <Graxe_> Spacer's Choice is the most memorable corporation out of all the them in the Board.
[2:41:50] <stfn893> who is this guy again
[2:41:50] <%thegreatestbambe> @AngriestPat how many hours have you logged in now?
[2:41:56] <%Ner234> Shocker
[2:42:01] <KishinGrek> Shoot him
[2:42:14] <Graxe_> MSI is notable because it was abandoned and trying to be better due to Sanjar.
[2:42:14] <Prism_Wing> When's Spaceship Warlock
[2:42:14] <%Binary_Fireball> fuck his fake eyebrows
[2:42:16] <%dekkitout> Oh, a snuff ring- joy
[2:42:17] <KishinGrek> Shoot him hard
[2:42:18] <%Soulbishop> look at this guy rocking google glass in the future

[2:55:33] <fabo_joyful> !uptime
[2:55:33] <%terminallyCapriciousz> @alpha8087 weekly podcast over at "CastleSuperBeast" tomorrow at 1 pm EST.
[2:55:33] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 55m.
[2:55:34] <DocMadfox> Tax fraud
[2:55:39] <%AncelDeLambert> nah, main quest is another two hours at max
[2:55:40] <loskotukha> Yeah you pass by it while there
[2:55:49] <KishinGrek> Coward
[2:55:55] <Zaphire_Saucypants> at least do the alien thing and maybe the main quest on Byzantium
[2:55:58] <%crimsonharvest> did this game get better after Groundbreaker and Roseway? I quit because it easy and kind of rote
[2:56:03] <%joylent_blue> canadian thanksgiving was a while ago
[2:56:20] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Theory: what if Ellie's parents actually do care, and this whole thing was a ploy to troll her and teach her a lesson?
[2:56:21] <%Alpha8087> @terminallyCapriciousz OH right. Haha I always pick it up as a download when driving for work, I forget its actually streamed.
[2:56:23] <%joylent_blue> crimsonharvest if anything it gets worse after that
[2:56:31] <%AncelDeLambert> oh, right, this asshole
[2:56:35] <%InugamiTheHound> sjw npc
[2:56:45] <%AncelDeLambert> did Pat ever read her policy "payouts"?
[2:56:46] <Zombrocom> You know, the title "legbreaker" is normally supposed to mean breaking other peoples legs, not your own
[2:56:51] <%dekkitout> @GarbageQueenEllie It takes an Ellie to think like an Ellie, brilliant
[2:56:56] <%Marpolo13> sh'es RIGHT THERE
[2:56:58] <%AncelDeLambert> Ellie, shh
[2:56:58] <%terminallyCapriciousz> @alpha8087 I usually miss it live due to my sleep schedule so I usually watch the vod later in the night :P so I get what you mean
[2:57:13] <+Reizie_Etherealm> "Are you for real?" lool
[2:57:14] <%AncelDeLambert> wow
[2:57:15] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> LUL LUL LUL
[2:57:19] <tigerfang86> lmao
[2:57:23] <%AncelDeLambert> Ellie SHUT
[2:57:28] <%thegreatestbambe> Was there a reason why a lot of the female npcs had the same hair through out the game? Was it an engine thing?
[2:57:28] <%Razputin217> Bitch are you for real?
[2:57:39] <%Jrocy247> ACTING......
[2:57:47] <Zombrocom> There just are not very many hairstyles
[2:57:47] <pmtriox> why the fuck would anyone not want to murder their parents after that
[2:57:48] <%cureneckbeard> that's the fashion in the future
[2:57:51] <%Deano8817> LUL LADY
[2:58:00] <%dekkitout> RLY....
[2:58:00] <%Marpolo13> wtf is this quest

[2:58:01] <+SuperMonkey2> wink wink nudge nudge
[2:58:02] <ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Yeah this lady is great
[2:58:06] <tigerfang86> of course
[2:58:06] <%Marpolo13> it's like.....wat
[2:58:07] <%GarbageQueenEllie> bitch, she's RIGHT THERE. you could literally just pull up her picture
[2:58:07] <%AncelDeLambert> WINK
[2:58:07] <%crimsonharvest> you say 'fraud' like law exists
[2:58:08] <shiny_prinny> that would be fraud :)
[2:58:10] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> intimidate
[2:58:10] <tigerfang86> of.... course
[2:58:11] <%Razputin217> Airquotes
[2:58:12] <%dekkitout> Technically, no...
[2:58:13] <Dakuu75> DON'T TELL ME WHAT TO DO MOM
[2:58:14] <%miguelrod777> wink wink
[2:58:17] <loskotukha> @pmtriox like it's fucks up but it's not like they hate her
[2:58:21] <%Jrocy247> Seriously Lady...
[2:58:23] <CrypticMochi> Steal the whole city
[2:58:30] <pmtriox> this is beyond fucked up
[2:58:35] <%AncelDeLambert> ... but you're the one that assesses your premiums...
[2:58:40] <KishinGrek> Lol American insurance
[2:58:43] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> thx bitch
[2:58:53] <%thegreatestbambe> Also this character arc was fucking stupid, Ellie didn't change at all
[2:58:56] <Zebroneath> For a lady who works at life insurance, she has piss poor of it herself.
[2:59:01] <%joylent_blue> Ada would be jealous
[2:59:06] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> I didn't know insurance fraud was so easy.
[2:59:08] <pmtriox> getting a payout for your daughter's life insurance, that's the kind of thing i'd get violent over
[2:59:10] <%Tearonex> so the payout is like 30000 bits a month
[2:59:21] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @thegreatestbambe the troll parents idea was way better
[2:59:28] <%Teintstein> because I want the best ending
[2:59:37] <loskotukha> @thegreatestbambe Its like actual people don't change that easily

[3:06:09] <%AncelDeLambert> dis about VEGGIES?!
[3:06:12] <%AncelDeLambert> IMPOSSIBLE BURGER!
[3:06:13] <%Animorphimagi> DIET toothpaste
[3:06:14] <%honeyman18> BIG PROBLEM
[3:06:17] <ianabstract> Welcome to the most dire subplot
[3:06:17] <%Binary_Fireball> Eat her nose
[3:06:18] <%Razputin217> Underlying Plot
[3:06:23] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> This was basically revealed on the first planet. The plague is malnutrition.
[3:06:26] <%AncelDeLambert> so, yeah, fucking colony has SCURRVY
[3:06:27] <HyperBomb21> incoming starvation
[3:06:33] <Psyramics> this is some real sci-fi shit
[3:06:35] <%Marpolo13> why she look like a dud
[3:06:35] <%crimsonharvest> how about you just hire a dietary scientist instead of this bullshit
[3:06:38] <lyzejag> 4
[3:06:39] <+Tarage> ALIENS
[3:06:40] <%Binary_Fireball> soylent and greeeeen

[3:06:46] <+Tarage> 3
[3:06:48] <Zaphire_Saucypants> he's thinking!
[3:06:51] <%AncelDeLambert> @crimsonharvest LUL trying to talk sense at the Board
[3:06:53] <%Razputin217> BECOME AS ALIENS
[3:06:54] <%Daniel_Is_I> And so the solution is RAPTORMEN
[3:06:54] <nah_stradamus> buh what about the aliems
[3:06:55] <OvaltineDream> aliums
[3:06:55] <%Animorphimagi> i wish he was finishing this tonight
[3:06:57] <%dekkitout> It does seem reasonable that the ecology of other planets wouldn't do well with earth crops
[3:06:57] <%Jrocy247> AAAAAND thats the reason the Plague exist on Edgewater
[3:06:58] <%Seraphile> @DesuDesuDokiDoki the proper veggies don't work
[3:07:00] <%miguelrod777> BRAIN BLAST
[3:07:02] <tigerfang86> we need to BECOM ALIEN
[3:07:03] <%marsanta> Terraforming didn't work right, food don't grow right
[3:07:05] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Why would you solve the problem that way? Wouldn't it be better to fix the food instead of the human characteristics?
[3:07:05] <%doc_ock_rokc> @DesuDesuDokiDoki probably, because the soil wouldn't work
[3:07:08] <CrypticMochi> Make us lizardmen!
[3:07:11] <%Teintstein> @AngriestPat you've said you'd live as a toilet - surely whatever she'd do wouldn't be that bad
[3:07:17] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> "Soylent" yeah Pat
[3:07:21] <%Bluwizard21> @angriestpat oh yeah, it's all coming together
[3:07:26] <%Daniel_Is_I> Diet Toothpaste

[3:07:30] <%Puhff> System is fucked bro
[3:07:30] <ape_hawk> and the diet toothpaste
[3:07:31] <Zombrocom> Diet. Toothpaste.
[3:07:31] <%cmdrmobium> diet toothpaste
[3:07:33] <HyperBomb21> constant cut corners
[3:07:35] <%Puhff> Time to find a new one
[3:07:38] <%mostly_simple> Corporate oversight the game
[3:07:44] <%Puhff> And kill The Board before you leave
[3:07:46] <Graxe_> Diet toothpaste designed to reduced hunger
[3:07:52] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> @Seraphile @doc_ock_rokc the hippies did it tho right?
[3:07:52] <%AncelDeLambert> yeah, the guy who pulled you out of that pod is the most important most RIGHT person in existence
[3:07:57] <%crimsonharvest> yeah that's Sunk Cost talking
[3:08:00] <tigerfang86> oooooof
[3:08:01] <Zebroneath> Not enough to sustain everyone
[3:08:02] <%Tearonex> the colony is fucked
[3:08:04] <BeefyQueefer> appetite suppressant
[3:08:05] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Just import some shit?
[3:08:08] <%doc_ock_rokc> @DesuDesuDokiDoki on Terra ferma
[3:08:14] <HyperBomb21> It's impossible to side with the Board unless you're intentionally looking to wipe this colony

[3:10:26] <%crimsonharvest> it was already for nothing because the board would never save everyone

[3:12:28] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> ALIVE
[3:12:31] <Paperware> Welp Hagen is gonna be pissed
[3:12:31] <ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> It took 100 persuade to say that cheesy bull
[3:12:32] <%Admiralpoosh> Admiralpoosh subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 33 months! 
[3:12:34] <Graxe_> The only nutrient-rich food rations are in Byzantium

[3:12:40] <loskotukha> Holy shit it's borderlands lady
[3:12:42] <+griffball13> just like Captain America
[3:12:44] <%honeyman18> So no Supplies and nothing here?
[3:12:44] <Zaphire_Saucypants> notes on the walls
[3:12:47] <Graxe_> Considering Byzantium is the rich and everyone seems fine
[3:12:52] <Zaphire_Saucypants> if you want to read more about the situation
[3:12:57] <%Marpolo13> can't you just SAY you killed the dr?
[3:12:59] <Calek> has Pat seen Hortense?
[3:13:07] <Zaphire_Saucypants> yeah, there's a billboard with notes
[3:13:19] <CrypticMochi> That ship had loads of skilled people right?
[3:13:19] <%Animorphimagi> its very lame
[3:13:21] <+Reizie_Etherealm> If veggies can't be grown, what about herding or breeding livestock?
[3:13:21] <ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Lie isn't an option?
[3:13:30] <Lurantis_> Wooly cows!
[3:13:30] <%Bluwizard21> @angriestpat there's another quest in byzantium from a woman on the streets in the rich district
[3:13:31] <%marsanta> She's ULTRA PARANOID, you're being watched
[3:13:45] <loskotukha> Remember she has connections to find out if you actually did it
[3:13:50] <%Puhff> Earth is fucked, resources are fucked, adn the Early Retirement Program is just Sylent Green or something
[3:13:55] <Graxe_> Homo halcyonis
[3:14:08] <%AncelDeLambert> I never checked back in with the salvage chick LUL
[3:14:13] <Zaphire_Saucypants> yeah, only two things to read really
[3:14:30] <%Marpolo13> TLDR: we fucked
[3:14:36] <%Seraphile> don't spoil on early retirement
[3:14:37] <%AbnormalVoid> as a joke
[3:14:44] <+griffball13> @AngriestPat how could they fuck up that bad i mean really
[3:14:46] <tigerfang86> we terraformed these planets wrong
[3:14:47] <Zaphire_Saucypants> one last side quest I think
[3:14:48] <tigerfang86> as a joke
[3:14:48] <%dekkitout> Tl;dr, some dumbass forgot to carry a 1
[3:14:49] <whirly25> do you defeat capitalism for the final level?
[3:14:54] <Lurantis_> The only food Humanity needs is chicken strips from Jack in the Box
[3:14:58] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> pat figured out retirement
[3:15:02] <lesbianmimikyu> i mean he called what early retirement is last stream, it's not really a twist
[3:15:13] <Zaphire_Saucypants> next to
[3:15:16] <Zaphire_Saucypants> next to you
[3:15:19] <%honeyman18> So the corporate ruled solar system is all we have. That is a kick in the nuts.
[3:15:21] <Paperware> Maybe earth sent us away because they didn't want to deal with the corporations
[3:15:22] <Zaphire_Saucypants> on a stoop
[3:15:25] <%marsanta> You ran past her
[3:15:26] <Zombrocom> The lady who just yelled
[3:15:26] <Zaphire_Saucypants> not a bench
[3:15:28] <BeefyQueefer> speak to the bench lady, she's a cunt
[3:15:28] <Calek> Hortense Ingalsbee is who you want
[3:15:28] <+cactuarzzzzzzz> Commies

[3:15:34] <%cmdrmobium> talk to bench
[3:15:37] <Graxe_> Hortense is still yelling about your presence
[3:15:44] <%marsanta> Yay!

[3:16:27] <RushUnplugged> oh Ellie always the best
[3:16:29] <+griffball13> AND YOUR STRAVING TO DEATH YOU BITCH
[3:16:31] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> WHAT DO YOU MEAN, "YOU PEOPLE?!"
[3:16:33] <+G_Thunders> So do we get an answer on why The Board is comically evil? Like, it’s not just “rich people bad” right?
[3:16:36] <%Animorphimagi> Madness? THIS IS SPARTA
[3:16:36] <%nekodelic> "go back to your country"
[3:16:37] <+TrevSmith222> Yeah, this is a really good side quest.
[3:16:39] <Mogel56> She literally looks like a hobo
[3:16:39] <%Razputin217> You need LEGS to frolic
[3:16:40] <tigerfang86> D E C O R U M
[3:16:45] <BeefyQueefer> frolicking is a side effect of the damage you've done to your legs
[3:16:45] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> eyeshadows
[3:16:47] <+Tarage> WE LIVE IN A SOCIETY
[3:16:48] <Dakuu75> are you a space-nazi?
[3:16:49] <Lurantis_> @g_thunders it pretty much is
[3:16:51] <%crimsonharvest> DECORUM IS DEATH
[3:16:54] <+FGCMonkeyBizness> Bro I nuked the NCR and the Legion today with my boy Ulysses
[3:16:55] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Those can be enforced on the new people! What's wrong with having new people?
[3:17:02] <Lurantis_> They’re comedically evil
[3:17:04] <%AncelDeLambert> nah, not even your parents earned this. I don't think the original colonizers really earned it
[3:17:14] <%dekkitout> Oh god, it's Giver
[3:17:15] <%AncelDeLambert> HAHAHAH BITCH YOU DUMB
[3:17:16] <Zaphire_Saucypants> save when you turn in this quest. Glad I did, so I could give her a PROPER goodbye.
[3:17:16] <Graxe_> Everyone has a shot to get into Byzantium
[3:17:20] <+G_Thunders> @lurantis_ ughhh I’ve been hoping since the first planet that it was deeper than that. Haven’t finished the game but that’s disappointing
[3:17:21] <%GarbageNirvana> Because lotteries in a system like this always work out for the best
[3:17:21] <tigerfang86> yo the SUPER RICH ZONE
[3:17:22] <%Ner234> That sounds ... suspect.
[3:17:22] <ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> That sound's suspicious
[3:17:22] <%SwdVengeance> Oh god, this quest
[3:17:22] <%miguelrod777> those people are dead
[3:17:27] <Zebroneath> There were some Early Retirement pamphlets in Edgewater.

[3:17:39] <%crimsonharvest> you 'deserve' to be shot in the mouth lady
[3:17:42] <Lurantis_> @g_thunders it’s still played really well, it’s a mixture of malice and incompetence
[3:17:44] <%Ner234> A lot actually
[3:17:46] <NeroInfinite> eat the rich
[3:17:47] <%crimsonharvest> kill her and take the money
[3:17:50] <%crimsonharvest> dont fuckin listen to this

[3:18:34] <%Teintstein> pls kill her after the quest pat

[3:19:44] <Run44forrest> space e girl
[3:19:45] <%crimsonharvest> didn't we see some 'retirement' back at the first town
[3:19:51] <Flarepulse> perhaps you can show her the retirement sector by putting her in a wheelchair
[3:19:59] <%nekodelic> didn't exhaust her dialogue
[3:20:04] <Mogel56> soylent green shit
[3:20:08] <Graxe_> And it's a random lottery
[3:20:16] <BeefyQueefer> "random"
[3:20:17] <Graxe_> And there's more every day somehow

[3:20:22] <%AncelDeLambert> ... you KNOW what this city's coming too, you dork
[3:20:29] <Zaphire_Saucypants> yup. Very much a Lottery, ain't it?
[3:20:30] <%AncelDeLambert> YOU are doing it!
[3:20:33] <NeroInfinite> man how could this happen so fast
[3:20:48] <%Marpolo13> i wonder indeed
[3:20:49] <Zaphire_Saucypants> stuff to read
[3:20:50] <Graxe_> Celeste was basically the only outfitter and leader of fashion
[3:20:50] <Zombrocom> Yes, a "lottery"
[3:20:53] <+griffball13> RAPTURE
[3:20:53] <%AncelDeLambert> god, I want to make so many jokes but I can't until Pat moves the main quest along
[3:20:56] <OvaltineDream> I wonder~~
[3:21:00] <NeroInfinite> ...
[3:21:01] <%MaddyCaddy> Should probably do the main story so you get the big exposition
[3:21:01] <Zaphire_Saucypants> this shit's on repeat btw
[3:21:06] <NeroInfinite> I don't like this
[3:21:07] <Graxe_> Oh
[3:21:07] <LixFury> this is a gas chamber isnt it
[3:21:09] <Graxe_> This is nice
[3:21:10] <%dekkitout> Oh no, I'm having Fallout New Vegas flashbacks monkaS
[3:21:15] <Zebroneath> Yeah......no
[3:21:15] <Run44forrest> early retirement sounds super ominous
[3:21:16] <%Razputin217> The Green Mile
[3:21:17] <%Divryne> This sounds like a meat factory.
[3:21:20] <$SpecterHDMC> anybody else getting Vault tec vibes from this
[3:21:20] <%Daniel_Is_I> Falskawud LUL
[3:21:21] <%Jrocy247> This shit is FUUUUUUCKED
[3:21:23] <Graxe_> This does loop, but hear all of it
[3:21:27] <%AncelDeLambert> LUL
[3:21:30] <%miguelrod777> Soylent is being made back there isn't it
[3:21:40] <%AncelDeLambert> the IKEA joke is pretty good
[3:21:42] <%Auctorian> cheer500 why is my district a single room with no windows, a heavy steel door and a showerhead?
[3:21:47] <Zaphire_Saucypants> so SPECIAL
[3:21:52] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> This quest seems familiar.
[3:21:53] <tigerfang86> you're special
[3:21:54] <tigerfang86> totally
[3:21:59] <Zaphire_Saucypants> oh so special
[3:22:05] <%crimsonharvest> thats still thousands of people a year
[3:22:06] <%marsanta> 2.3% is SUPER HIGH for a lottery
[3:22:10] <tigerfang86> NO CRIME
[3:22:14] <tigerfang86> I WONDER WHY
[3:22:14] <%skibadaa> Getting REALLY strong Vault 11 vibes
[3:22:16] <+Caped_Eggy> !uptime
[3:22:16] <vaderxyz1970> This feels like Auwshwitz with extra steps
[3:22:17] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 22m.
[3:22:18] <NeroInfinite> Can't have dissidnts if you don't have people
[3:22:19] <%Marpolo13> i hope it's actually all true because it's obviously not
[3:22:22] <Zebroneath> This is like the hall in Dead Space 2 with all the fun facts that religion had.
[3:22:25] <Graxe_> 2.3% of basically everyone in the colony not in Byzantium
[3:22:29] <%miguelrod777> h.mmmmmm

[3:24:43] <tigerfang86> GRIME ZONE
[3:24:45] <+griffball13> WOOOOO
[3:24:46] <%honeyman18> I'll be real honest, this section hit me way harder than it honestly should have. I wanted to kill the board after talking myself into thinking they were needed.
[3:24:47] <$SpecterHDMC> ah shit

[3:25:22] <%Teintstein> shit's big fucked
[3:25:24] <Run44forrest> oh elderly
[3:25:36] <Zaphire_Saucypants> to reduce the number of mouths to feed of course @Run44forrest
[3:25:42] <%marsanta> It's almost like they are trying to drastically lower the population for some reason
[3:25:54] <%Jrocy247> The Boomers were sent to their deaths
[3:25:55] <go4thekneez> is this on normal?
[3:26:03] <%skibadaa> Yep, Vault 11.
[3:26:06] <RubberFistFight> I think Pat sent his internet squirrels over to Australia because the last three of the last four streams I've tried to do have ended prematurely due to internet outages LUL
[3:26:11] <%honeyman18> I'm pretty sure its drastically cull the people that will rebel first.
[3:26:27] <%AncelDeLambert> fucking FNAF
[3:26:29] <%Daniel_Is_I> Disable them after they're already dead
[3:26:29] <%MightyMaxT> Just got here. Did I miss Ellie's side quest?
[3:26:35] <Run44forrest> idk i feel like thered be cheaper more efficient ways to cull the population
[3:26:35] <%Teintstein> @MightyMaxT yup
[3:26:44] <loskotukha> @mightymaxt yes
[3:26:53] <OvaltineDream> come on ellie
[3:26:57] <%AncelDeLambert> @Run44forrest carbon monoxide springs instantly to mind
[3:26:58] <Zaphire_Saucypants> yup
[3:26:59] <%Daniel_Is_I> WHO COULD HAVE KNOWN
[3:27:02] <Futurecity10> I never saw this.
[3:27:02] <Graxe_> Not even for food
[3:27:02] <vaderxyz1970> Ellie is a doctor
[3:27:05] <Zebroneath> Dead Board soldier in side ahllway
[3:27:06] <Graxe_> Just execution
[3:27:07] <%Teintstein> nope - big waste of life
[3:27:09] <NeroInfinite> nope it's a kill room
[3:27:13] <Zaphire_Saucypants> yeah, FUCK the Board
[3:27:15] <BeefyQueefer> too many mouths to feed
[3:27:15] <Zebroneath> hallway*
[3:27:17] <%honeyman18> Just bullets
[3:27:20] <NeroInfinite> at least make them into soylent green
[3:27:20] <%marsanta> Gotta get those numbers DOWN
[3:27:21] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> fuck the board
[3:27:23] <%MaddyCaddy> Should continue the story to figure out why
[3:27:23] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> At least the nominal number of people who die goes down each year.
[3:27:24] <%InugamiTheHound> they need to save money and food
[3:27:26] <CrmznOgre> Times are rough pat
[3:27:29] <%Marpolo13> they couldn't have written that one a little better though? make it a LITTLE less obvious? o well
[3:27:29] <%MightyMaxT> Damn. I was gonna watch the VOD later anyway
[3:27:31] <%Jay_Squirrel> they dont have to work anymore tho
[3:27:40] <OvaltineDream> burn it down?
[3:27:41] <Calek> I can't wait to do a Pro Board playthrough
[3:27:46] <%Puhff> Yeah wtf Board
[3:27:46] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> When there' s only 100 people left, that's like 2 people a year. Nothign!
[3:27:48] <+griffball13> @AngriestPat you should get that nice lady a ticket
[3:27:52] <%johnny_gogo> @AngriestPat YOU CAN SIDE WITH THEM
[3:27:52] <%crimsonharvest> please respect my calls for blood
[3:27:56] <Graxe_> Back in the sewers
[3:27:57] <HyperBomb21> This is one of my problems with the writing in this game. They didn't give us any reason to ever side with the board
[3:27:58] <Zaphire_Saucypants> save before you turn in the quest
[3:28:05] <42nfl19> And it looks like they aren't doing it efficiently...I mean wait what?
[3:28:07] <Graxe_> Maybe that's why there's a sprat problem
[3:28:07] <%Puhff> Be cool if it were different if you told Tobson about the corpse fertilizer
[3:28:08] <Run44forrest> it sucks they just make you board king
[3:28:13] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> This is not at all like that Fallout quest.
[3:28:18] <%Marpolo13> @HyperBomb21 yeah it's a little too once sided i the sense
[3:28:18] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> Where exactly this haoppens.
[3:28:21] <loskotukha> @hyperbomb21 They give constant reasons, Money
[3:28:24] <%honeyman18> Tuna, now 20% more meat, may contain human
[3:28:32] <%Seraphile> @HyperBomb21 never gave us a reason to side with the legion in FNV either
[3:28:36] <%nekodelic> save
[3:28:40] <%thenumber5point5> is not dieing believing a happy lie better than looseing your self to slow starvation
[3:28:40] <lesbianmimikyu> sometime villains.... are bad
[3:28:43] <+G_Thunders> So I’m assuming the board is “saving the colony” according to them, since there’s not enough food for everyone living here
[3:28:45] <HyperBomb21> @loskotukha yeah okay, but you'd only want that if you're stupid.
[3:28:50] <%crimsonharvest> do the lie

[3:29:26] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I'm glad. If you told her the truth, she'd say OH GOOD FUCK THE POOR
[3:29:29] <Run44forrest> :)
[3:29:34] <%nekodelic> @angriestpat there were dialogue lines you didn't use from earlier
[3:29:35] <RushUnplugged> fullblown capitalism is always the only reason behind anything the Board does and what a pro-Board character does. "Fuck you pay me" and that's it, there's no other reason because it's just selfishness.
[3:29:35] <%AncelDeLambert> ... FUCK THIS BITCH
[3:29:37] <%Teintstein> welp
[3:29:40] <%TDAWS_MP132> yes

[3:30:11] <%nekodelic> @angriestpat really, reload to exhaust her dialogue
[3:30:13] <loskotukha> CHOOSE THE OTHER OPTION ITS FUNNY
[3:30:15] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I think the next area beyond the kill room are backup robots
[3:30:18] <$i_am_therydon> you did the right thing pat.
[3:30:20] <BeefyQueefer> one big toilet and you all have to go at the same time

[3:31:26] <Calek> There is enough food but it does jack all
[3:31:28] <%Seraphile> it just holds no nutrition
[3:31:32] <+RootShaman> its not even that there isn't enough food, its that the food we're growing isn't nutritious enough
[3:31:34] <%AncelDeLambert> there's plenty of food, they just don't grow the stuff they can't market
[3:31:36] <%Ner234> Not enough AND it's awful food

[3:35:09] <%AncelDeLambert> that's a GREAT way to pick up bad habits
[3:35:10] <%doc_ock_rokc> and anarchy reigns
[3:35:10] <DocMadfox> Cheer500 So there's a XCom-esque 40k game called Mechanicus on Steam, any interest in playing that at some point by chance and making yourself part toilet in service to the Omnissiah?
[3:35:15] <CrmznOgre> guess we'll see u on woolie versus when it comes out?
[3:35:16] <Calek> you're just hella rusty at fighting games

[3:35:31] <Run44forrest> Kreygasm
[3:35:34] <%marsanta> I don't know why it matters, you're never going to EVO
[3:35:36] <%Teintstein> don't kill yourself on stream pat it's against the tos
[3:35:37] <Nina96> DEATH LIVE
[3:35:37] <%Auctorian> @AngriestPat it's about getting responsibilities, not so much about getting old
[3:35:39] <lesbianmimikyu> back in pats day you had to walk to the arcade to play fighting games, and it was uphill both ways!
[3:35:40] <%logoth_> neck at risk
[3:35:43] <%cureneckbeard> pat you literally play video games for a living
[3:35:45] <%CrabSlacks> pat paralyzed live on stream
[3:35:49] <%AncelDeLambert> @AngriestPat will you vote in the completely pointless Video Games Awards?

[3:35:55] <Akett> SamSho?
[3:35:55] <%doc_ock_rokc> smash with terry
[3:35:56] <RushUnplugged> Shenmue 3 has a review ban that lasts AFTER release, even if it doesn't suck, it's scum
[3:35:59] <%logoth_> tekken is hard as fuck
[3:35:59] <RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat you could record foley for the next mortal kombat X-ray moves with a neck like that Kappa
[3:35:59] <+Megamason> wish i had the outer worlds
[3:35:59] <%Deano8817> jump force, according to game awards
[3:35:59] <%AncelDeLambert> prob SamSho, yeah
[3:36:00] <DrBeanie> SamSho or Tekken
[3:36:04] <TheyCallMeVawn> Tekkens pretty easy to get into depending on the character
[3:36:05] <+Ominnous> Tekken isn't that easy to get into tho...
[3:36:06] <SpaceGuntank> Smash Bros Kappa
[3:36:08] <%PauliusMaximus> tekken is rad
[3:36:08] <%Marpolo13> @marsanta what does that have to do with anything? I'd imagine sucks playing a FG and literally never winning
[3:36:10] <faithless_zealot> Smash proly
[3:36:11] <%nekodelic> @auctorian but you get more responsibilities as you get older
[3:36:13] <%Deano8817> LUL
[3:36:13] <+joekuta71> Tekken's not a bad choice
[3:36:13] <Zebroneath> Jump Force LUL
[3:36:15] <koolaid_kevster> smash
[3:36:16] <%Jay_Squirrel> instead of shenmue just play another yakuzer
[3:36:17] <%johnny_gogo> Tekken 7 but you have to keep at it
[3:36:17] <RogerCxd> DOA 6
[3:36:20] <Run44forrest> ACTUALLY JUMP FORCE
[3:36:22] <%CrabSlacks> one must fall
[3:36:23] <Nina96> not SamSho woolie will go crazy
[3:36:25] <OvaltineDream> sumabro
[3:36:26] <jtdobyns> KI
[3:36:27] <%nekodelic> DOA is easy to get into
[3:36:28] <+phone5> Smash
[3:36:29] <ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> But do you hate grease?
[3:36:30] <%AncelDeLambert> he likes soap and cute gf
[3:36:31] <lesbianmimikyu> he can't play smash without getting rid of paige
[3:36:31] <%dekkitout> You like soap AND having a gf
[3:36:36] <Flarepulse> Pat has a girlfriend he can't play Smash
[3:36:36] <Dakuu75> who suggested Smash to Pat. are you new here? lol
[3:36:38] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Ask woolie, he's got a show that's literally called that lol
[3:36:39] <Nina96> and also pat has a girlfriend so he cant legal play smash
[3:36:40] <ThorW> Pat can't play Smash, he has a gf willing to give him emotional support
[3:36:42] <garbageheaphound> he may be a weeb, but he's not an unwashed weeb
[3:36:42] <%GarbageNirvana> Mushroom's harder to make everyone sick with
[3:36:43] <%Auctorian> @nekodelic it's a vicious, never ending cycle that NOBODY ever tells you about because nobody told them
[3:36:44] <+Ominnous> Tekken's got a great community and it's a great game. But it's information heavy for a fighting game
[3:36:44] <%Marpolo13> lol
[3:36:45] <Big_Dream> just ask max
[3:36:58] <garbageheaphound> I'll check it out
[3:37:01] <+Ominnous> you might get the wrong impression of fighting games if you use Tekken as a base
[3:37:04] <Nina96> :(
[3:37:04] <CrmznOgre> Hey Pat will we see u and Woolz at MagFest?

[3:38:13] <Nina96> oh god
[3:38:14] <%dekkitout> That would be cool if Woolie did that
[3:38:16] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat Update:fucking contractor emailed me, THEY haven't gotten the paperwork just a confrimation email that said I was hired. So I don't know if I actually got the job
[3:38:21] <Run44forrest> woolies white leg
[3:38:31] <zenith0111> LUL LUL LUL LUL
[3:38:47] <%Deano8817> LUL
[3:38:48] <%doc_ock_rokc> Fucking government burocrats
[3:38:52] <RubberFistFight> @doc_ock_rokc dude that blows. Employers don't seem to give a shit that they're playing with peoples lives when they do that.
[3:38:57] <%dekkitout> Those are some words...
[3:39:01] <%nekodelic> @auctorian it's fucked up, I know a lot of people who just were not prepared to handle it, myself somewhat included
[3:39:08] <Dakuu75> lol
[3:39:11] <OvaltineDream> you got that elephant pregnancy
[3:39:12] <zenith0111> rmzLOVE rmzLOVE rmzLOVE
[3:39:18] <%logoth_> Oh god I forgot about Woolie's gross white muscle leg
[3:39:24] <Zaphire_Saucypants> our stupidity resonates, building higher and higher into MAX STUPID.
[3:39:26] <%doc_ock_rokc> @RubberFistFight Its a defense contractor. To say they move in slowmotion and everything is paperwork all the way down
[3:39:27] <%anticrust> The 4 halves, Pat Paige Elmo and THE CHAT
[3:39:31] <%dekkitout> Those kids are gonna turn out fine
[3:39:37] <%OdysseyKnight> Android emulators exist
[3:39:38] <%marsanta> They'll know when they find out they were named Elmo after a cat
[3:39:40] <%quackisalive> You can emulate mobile games on the pc
[3:39:40] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Woolie's white leg is the best lore besides Pat's Lizards glasses
[3:39:41] <%cureneckbeard> 50% chat, 15% Paige, 30% elmo, 5% Pat
[3:39:54] <%Auctorian> @nekodelic Aye I agree with you on that one. One day I was laughing at the old man and his advice, now I am the old man ><
[3:40:06] <RubberFistFight> @doc_ock_rokc oh, yeah. Defense contractors make glaciers look like they're in a fucking hurry to get somewhere.
[3:40:06] <+Tarage> 100% ELMO
