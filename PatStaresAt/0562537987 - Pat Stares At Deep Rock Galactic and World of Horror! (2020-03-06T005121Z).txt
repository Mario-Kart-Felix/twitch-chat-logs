[0:02:43] <jimmypurple> Hey guys!
[0:02:50] <dakotachipmath> The audacity of this dwarf running away from RE6
[0:02:53] <%darcfowler1995> Yo fuck RE6
[0:02:55] <+PanicSwytch> I bet Pat is gonna eventually give up on RE6
[0:02:56] <%haystacks89> Interested to see which dwarf Pat mains
[0:03:04] <%AudioSpiral> I for one am glad we are not suffering tonight
[0:03:05] <%j0ustar> Pat, Coward Extraordinaire
[0:03:12] <%Lizard0TM> is the stream super quiet for anyone else?
[0:03:12] <lloyddboy> probably GUN dwarf
[0:03:12] <FriendlyPatches> today was re6 day, coward
[0:03:14] <%darcfowler1995> Pat is literally not having a good time with it and the game is shittyÔøº
[0:03:17] <%mMayrro> if pat didn't want to play RE6 he shouldn't have set up the poll psaWhat
[0:03:19] <%darcfowler1995> Pat is literally not having a good time with it and the game is shitty
[0:03:21] <%xUmbraNinja> No
[0:03:25] <NSFW_Nurgle> Remember the time all seven dwarves gave Snow White the deepest dicking imaginable? Oh, and when they became space miners too, I guess.
[0:03:39] <foulfoamz> cant escape re6 forever pat
[0:03:42] <dakotachipmath> Then give us REVELATIONS 2
[0:03:42] <%YakumoYomi> Pepperidge Farms remembers.
[0:03:44] <jimmypurple> RE6 is dookie let the man have fun cowards
[0:03:49] <%AudioSpiral> Well you're at least living up to your name, @NSFW_Nurgle
[0:03:51] <+penndra> give üëè us üëè more üëè re6 üëè
[0:03:59] <NSFW_Nurgle> Thank you
[0:04:03] <+PanicSwytch> I agree RE6 is garbage, but I find amusement in Pat suffering
[0:04:09] <+PigGuy800> oooooh deep rock galactic i love this game
[0:04:26] <dakotachipmath> I‚Äôll give up on RE6 but next up is REV 2 on the list isn‚Äôt it?
[0:04:27] <enby_shout> E X P O S E Y O U R S E L F P A T
[0:04:28] <%AudioSpiral> I'm stopping by because I've had this game on my wishlist for a while but don't know if I'd actually be into it.
[0:04:46] <%haystacks89> DRG is really good
[0:05:00] <dakotachipmath> Deep Cock Giraffedick
[0:05:03] <%Bebuzzu> Yes it is!
[0:05:07] <%YakumoYomi> Having finished RE6 earlier this week, I can understand his desire to duck it. Thankfully, the Ada campaign was less obnoxious than the others.
[0:05:12] <%ShineTheDiamond> Pat's really desperate to avoid RE6, isn't he? I feel that. If he dislikes it so much, I'd rather him move on than torture himself...
[0:05:13] <BoneofMalkav> Deep Rock Galactic AND World of Horror? Love WOH already so I'm intrigued.
[0:05:15] <%AudioSpiral> I see the positive reviews but then some of my friends have some mixed opinions on it so otzShrug
[0:05:16] <TheArrow_> is this a feet stream?
[0:05:21] <Hellarussian> all future RE6 streams will be replaced with Raid: Shadow Legends
[0:05:25] <%AudioSpiral> Oh is WOH tonight too?

[0:20:48] <%ElkRiverDog> Cheer100 Cheer100 Cheer100 Cheer100 Cheer100 If you‚Äôre still looking to cleanse your palate from the giraffe jizz of RE6, you could try the Alisa demo. It‚Äôs (basically) a one man homage to RE 1 style games. Hope you have fun today.

[0:35:17] <%Frost_Quill> @PatStaresAt So far I've seen nothing you can't do with a heavily modded game of Minecraft.
[0:35:18] <rufus2k2> Red Faction 2, MP aside, is caca
[0:35:21] <+MeatBomb> Pat playing minecraft again? What a nerd. :P
[0:35:27] <%AxelCezar> this game missed the oportunity to use mithril and adamant names
[0:35:27] <+Buttsong> dorf faction
[0:35:27] <ScreamLord> We need more Red Faction and Red Faction-like games
[0:35:28] <narusao> my M.U.L.E.

[0:35:51] <ShichiNoBushi> A "Bro-bot"?
[0:35:52] <AFlyingTaco1> I actually really like this. Do they have far future plans to put this on console?
[0:35:55] <Man_in_the_Red> so that explains the clipping, what crazy man would play solo
[0:36:00] <Hellarussian> the flood

[0:43:36] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt Given the typical fantasy Dwarf if they were real Dwarves would either be the first race to unlock space travel or they'd NEVER unlock it
[0:43:37] <+Lunarhawk> @PatStaresAt You need to buy every upgrade on your guns even if you can only equip one per tier cause it gets you the passive bonuses that are locked on the bottom of the screen when looking at the guns
[0:43:37] <Twichty> one is
[0:43:38] <%WhereIsWill> perks PogChamp
[0:43:42] <Twichty> u can eventually tame a spider
[0:43:43] <King_Wolf_Rigger> That's a tree-and-a-half
[0:43:47] <SparkAfterDark> but what if you pick the wrong perk and your character is bad now?
[0:43:53] <@SSaryn> Most are actually upgrades to existing perks, dont worry it's not that many
[0:43:54] <Hellarussian> so an expert pooper?
[0:44:00] <SparkAfterDark> You must pick the optimal choice
[0:44:03] <+gralho> Do you like passion fruit?
[0:44:03] <Dreziv> Remember, those of you that haven't played this game: 1/2 statements Pat has made are completely wrong
[0:44:12] <%Frost_Quill> Dogmeat perks.
[0:44:13] <@StridentSong> So it doesn't look like we can join on you, you'd have to invite people to your lobby

[2:00:40] <%ShogunNoonto> Elf beer you mean water
[2:00:41] <+Klonoa__> welcometohell welcometohell welcometohell

[2:00:46] <+andrewoid_> ROCK AND STONE

[2:00:57] <%SlimeSlimeSlime> You're not wrong!
[2:01:07] <Monkeyweed21> But the awful dialogue is GREAT
[2:01:07] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> tru
[2:01:10] <@commanderclaw> Dwarves piloting mechs
[2:01:11] <crimsonsaens> Just play the old Armored Core games
[2:01:12] <Daxalog> What if the pilots in daemon where dwarves?
[2:01:15] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> wait for a pc mod
[2:01:18] <s1rcuit> If only DaemonXMachina's dialogue was replaced with Deep Rock"s
[2:01:20] <Tucker0603> I like daemon X Machina, but it's dialog is goofy
[2:01:24] <dabirSA> ROCK and STONE
[2:01:25] <%DensityD> BY THE BEARD
[2:01:25] <zafooru> i love this so goddamn much
[2:01:29] <+Klonoa__> limesYay for karl!
[2:01:31] <%Punchasaur> or just less cringe dialogue
[2:01:32] <%foreverN2dust> Like Armored Core
[2:01:39] <@SSaryn> Molly
[2:01:43] <%OkamiDude15> so is the optimal daemon ex machina experience playing skipping all cutscenes and turning the voices off?
[2:01:44] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> Molly
[2:01:46] <Essixian> When are you planning on switching to World of Horror?
[2:01:50] <%xUmbraNinja> Molly

[2:02:05] <%TIME_PUNCHER> dialogue is the worst thing to happen to video games. you know I'm right
[2:02:08] <rilou501> Anymore Destiny 2 or is that bust?
[2:02:09] <fruit_pie_the_magician> This is like Helldivers except Space Dwarves
[2:02:18] <%cureneckbeard> "boss makes dollar I make dime" is an unrealistically optimistic view of financial inequality for 2020
[2:02:18] <%shocknawful> i wonder if they wanted to call those mushrooms plump helmets?
[2:02:22] <+SergeEXE> @TIME_PUNCHER DMC3 says otherwise
[2:02:31] <dinkyrink> @TIME_PUNCHER it's true and you should say it
[2:02:34] <@SSaryn> Destiny 2 is in the shitter right now
[2:02:36] <$caliginouscalico> @shocknawful BOLOO CAP
[2:02:37] <%DensityD> find dirt, and live in it
[2:02:45] <%TIME_PUNCHER> @sergeexe does it tho
[2:02:50] <%TroyMSW> I played a lot of destiny that first season it went to Steam, but then I dropped off the second that season ended.

[2:02:57] <SGrim> @PatStaresAt mobility
[2:02:58] <JayEarly> My favorite minor 40k alien are those dumb space monkeys that are somehow savants at making weapons
[2:02:58] <+FrenchTact1cs> English is your first language
[2:02:58] <Tucker0603> I love destiny 2
[2:02:59] <%AnIcedCoffee> traversal

[2:03:10] <$caliginouscalico> pat scout has even more movement that driller
[2:03:13] <rilou501> It hurts
[2:03:30] <FrootusClopootus> should have seen the week where you could double jump
[2:03:33] <Daxalog> Now im curious as to what an Elf in this game looks like
[2:03:39] <%TroyMSW> What a week that was
[2:03:41] <%Punchasaur> william hung, a memelord before memes
[2:03:49] <%Sxy_T_Rex> @PatStaresAt a skilled driller can also trivialize an extraction by just making a tunnel straight to the droppod
[2:03:51] <%TIME_PUNCHER> @daxalog a wussy
[2:03:55] <Daxalog> Like do elves in this game just look like Destiny characters?
[2:04:02] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Daxalog ether hippys or nobels
[2:04:26] <rilou501> No one looks as ridiculous as Destiny characters
[2:04:29] <%DensityD> spitballers are so deadly, but spawner nexus is just a mind trick
[2:04:31] <%TIME_PUNCHER> elves look like n*sync wearing hemp
[2:04:39] <%shocknawful> i just love reading chat and picking out dwarf fortress players
[2:04:51] <$Dakuu75> getting some Big Daddy vibes

[2:05:26] <$Dakuu75> some ratchet and clank vibes too
[2:05:28] <haisho> I can't believe Limp Bizkit is in this game
[2:05:30] <%TroyMSW> The yellow rings are auto-mines. They detonate if any bug comes through, if you are there or not.
[2:05:31] <rilou501> Tolkien never predicted this

[2:07:06] <ShiningAxis> This game looks awesome

[2:07:11] <ShiningAxis> I'm gonna but it right now
[2:07:18] <$Dakuu75> gonna be sorry if you don't give um a name
[2:07:26] <%Ner234> @caliginouscalico Ah I see. That's cool
[2:07:30] <%TroyMSW> Using the zipline to become an attack helicopter is a viable strategy, until something knocks you off
[2:07:36] <+Proswagonizt> Yo I'm glad Pat is enjoying this game. Its so much fun.
[2:07:40] <$caliginouscalico> i think the end of this quest is a boss mission
[2:07:53] <%Valdorick> Sick beats
[2:07:54] <%DensityD> explosions are fun
[2:07:57] <+Karebuncle> is he just playing with randos or bots or what
[2:08:04] <%DensityD> that's the secondary tagline of this game LUL

[2:08:14] <$caliginouscalico> @karebuncle steam friends
[2:08:18] <%TroyMSW> There's no AI dwarves in this game. The AI companion is a robot named Bosco
[2:08:27] <%weissguard> ~He's got friends on the ooother siiiiiide~
[2:08:31] <%Frost_Quill> Bosco is dope.

[2:12:04] <%croxeye> actually Pat i don't think i've ever asked since you don't use headphones how is the audio quality for you?
[2:12:05] <%shocknawful> Dwarves are so short its hard to tell if theyre on the ground

[2:15:28] <%YakumoYomi> Big wipeouts
[2:15:35] <+Klonoa__> looks like a scout grenade?
[2:15:46] <+Klonoa__> but yall don't have any of those

[2:16:07] <CobaltPhoenix27> that was the perk See you in hell
[2:16:10] <%Gohyakuen> @dakuu75 The supply pod heals also
[2:16:16] <%hrudzie_1> @doc_ock_rokc in all seriousness is this early access? this looks fun as hell
[2:16:24] <%AncelDeLambert> who the fuck would EVER work for this company again after an extraction like this?
[2:16:25] <%doc_ock_rokc> @hrudzie_1 yes
[2:16:27] <%SWFanatic> For Rock and Country
[2:16:29] <%BLK_HRLQN_13> yay what I miss
[2:16:30] <$caliginouscalico> @hrudzie_1 they very recently went 1.0
[2:16:31] <@SSaryn> psaBig bugs psaBig fire
[2:16:31] <%TroyMSW> It's almost out of Early Access
[2:16:36] <trianglehat> looks great
[2:16:37] <+Thorn14> I think its out
[2:16:41] <%AncelDeLambert> this is just ridiculous
[2:16:41] <%DensityD> this has evolved so much over early acess
[2:16:41] <%SlimeSlimeSlime> MVP = Most Valuable Pat
[2:16:47] <%SoFarFetched> PATS BEARD NE EDS TO BE BIGGER
[2:16:52] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt but they update rather frequently
[2:16:53] <%DensityD> 3 minerals LUL
[2:16:53] <%SeventyForce> It's like Killing Floor!
[2:16:53] <moore595> This a REALLY GOOD early game
[2:16:54] <rowboat_girlyman> Played this for like a year now, it's been a great basic gameplay loop for a while
[2:16:56] <+kralec> It's about to leave early access. it's as close to a finished game as it can get.
[2:16:56] <%xUmbraNinja> Red beard
[2:16:57] <%DedlokPM> best part of this is the misson control guy is the same voice actor as the misson control guy in that Warhammer 40k Kill Team game that THQ put out before they they went belly up/around the time they released Space Marine
[2:16:57] <$Dakuu75> are all the charactera big burly men? Where's my big burly women at?
[2:16:58] <rowboat_girlyman> they've only added onto it
[2:16:59] <dinkyrink> @AncelDeLambert that's capitalism baby
[2:17:00] <%Punchasaur> spaghetto beards
[2:17:04] <RunningNGunning> Its basically done other than some animation and QoL fixes
[2:17:06] <haisho> looks hella impressive for Early Access
[2:17:09] <ZeeR01> the game actually has a surprisingly low amount of bugs
[2:17:11] <%DensityD> SHOOT. THE. BUTT.
[2:17:12] <lloyddboy> ELIMINATION OH BOY
[2:17:12] <CobaltPhoenix27> kill kill kill
[2:17:15] <%Jekado> i wish there were more varried weapons types it seems like everyone has two types of weapons for primary and secondary
[2:17:20] <%DensityD> manage aggro and shoot the butt
[2:17:21] <$caliginouscalico> oh boy, elimination
[2:17:24] <@SSaryn> Not as good as you think
[2:17:30] <@SSaryn> Hover Boots I mean
[2:17:31] <%maskofmichael> Never Surrender
[2:17:34] <%TroyMSW> Hover boots suck, they offer no horizontal movement. Just stationary
[2:17:35] <lloyddboy> GAME CHANGER
[2:17:35] <%TIME_PUNCHER> Legend of Zelda boots
[2:17:35] <zafooru> Don't give up, Dwarf!
[2:17:36] <CobaltPhoenix27> field medic is better
[2:17:39] <$Dakuu75> 6/10 needs more buff women characters
[2:17:50] <$caliginouscalico> hover boots are only good for scout really
[2:17:51] <%hrudzie_1> how many dollars for this

[2:39:45] <%MajorCrasher> Are you still playing World of Horror tonight?
[2:39:51] <%chambatron> SO what |I'm guessing is that gets more diffivcult as time goes on?

[2:40:07] <$caliginouscalico> @chambatron he's playing on difficulty 2 of 5
[2:40:16] <%QuadraticGravity> They can only haunt you because bugs don't believe in ghosts.
[2:40:18] <%TIME_PUNCHER> LUL
[2:40:23] <%Lizard0TM> So is this game a lot more fun than you initially thought it would be?
[2:40:23] <%chambatron> So how long can you stay in a level? as long as you want?
[2:40:26] <%DensityD> be careful, the button could actual initiate a double wave
[2:40:30] <%Zulrez> pat are you minning on klendathu? is that why there are so many bugs?
[2:40:34] <%Ner234> ???
[2:40:39] <yhoryn> Woolie, somehow related to bugs. More on this later.
[2:40:40] <%TroyMSW> Launching the rocket spawns a new wave, even if you are fighting one already. It's a good idea to wait if you are under attack.
[2:40:41] <Cervarian> @chambatron For this mission type, yeah, it gets more difficult with time as well
[2:40:42] <ScreamLord> "I was afriad DRG wouldn't be enough to carry a whole stream." - @PatStaresAt

[3:22:36] <%s_snowball> ideally the floor
[3:22:37] <%jiin6> not the Celling or Floor
[3:22:39] <Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> @PatStaresAt don't EVER put your finger on the trigger unless you intend to fire it
[3:22:39] <corpsegoo> every time the basics of gun safety come up, I remember how I almost shot a teacher with an arror because he broke every basic safety rule in front of 9 year olds
[3:22:39] <%YakumoYomi> None of ya'll better say shit about me playing with my GLORIOUS NIPPON STEEL
[3:22:40] <%Jekado> its like guns were invented to kill something you point at?
[3:22:41] <%DukeMoose> dont touch your guns when you drink, thats illegal kids
[3:22:42] <korth367> i dont want floor to die :(
[3:22:42] <%Valdorick> Also, NEVER rest your finger on the trigger
[3:22:44] <+kralec> That is gun safety 101, also don't put your finger on the trigger unless you are about to shoot the gun.
[3:22:47] <TwinBat> killing floor
[3:22:51] <s0lesurviv0r> live close to a recently opened gun range and it scares me because I know people are idiots and it's next to a grocery store and gas station I always go to

[3:23:53] <%spiritofmojave> CHRISSSSSSS
[3:23:54] <Infinit_Phoenix> man kills hot air balloon enthusiast to save penis tip.
[3:24:01] <%GeneralSCPatton> Just aim the gun along the Zero Vector. You'll either shoot everything, or nothing.
[3:24:02] <%supersugoisenpai1> How does Barret follow gun safety rules?
[3:24:07] <FrootusClopootus> don't hold it up what if you shoot god?
[3:24:07] <%SoFarFetched> ITS A BREATH OF FRESH AIR
[3:24:08] <suikudo> Tryin to find that video of the guy with the gun
[3:24:11] <%ECRead> having the action broken until ready to fire is also ideal
[3:24:14] <corpsegoo> itt: the teacher had nine year olds draw bows, point them at targets then walked in front of them down the line, tiny nine year old me was not strong enough to keep the bow drawn without losing the arrow
[3:24:14] <suikudo> im not seeing it on his twitter
[3:24:17] <SirBrawler18> youll get through it, just not sober
[3:24:17] <%GarbageNirvana> so he no longer has a channel right
[3:24:20] <%spiritofmojave> it's on the docket tomorrow he must
[3:24:20] <%DensityD> LUL he's so angry about it LUL

[3:24:25] <%ElkRiverDog> @dhurkst And we‚Äôre the country that invented the Darwin Awards coxBrit
[3:24:25] <%DensityD> play RE6 LUL
[3:24:28] <%XeroSigmaPrime> The guy cocks the gun, then cocks it again, sees bullet come out. He claims he thought it was unloaded, but seeing a bullet eject tells him it was loaded
[3:24:28] <ape_hawk> you brought this on yourself, coward!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[3:24:31] <%maskofmichael> Don't be mad at us about RE6, you chose to do it
[3:24:33] <%SoFarFetched> @suikido you have to scroll abit more cause critikal retweeted about it 12 hours ago

[3:24:38] <%chill_o_wisp> I think he forgot that auto pistols have a bullet in the chamber
[3:24:39] <%DukeMoose> Drunk Him thinks he dropped the mag and racked the slide. in his mind, he empties the chamber, instead of chambering a new round

[4:12:04] <tranquilturnips> hmm why did I think the hammer was DEX
[4:12:06] <Hellarussian> crowbar probs
[4:12:06] <steelballsdeep> shovel is really optimal
[4:12:07] <CursedNobleman> STEEL THY SHOVEL
[4:12:08] <%Nny7229> Crowbar
[4:12:09] <+LordSDB> Wait what? Why low speed?
[4:12:10] <enby_shout> is that mlfuckingk
[4:12:10] <+Spr0cket> hammer and shovel
[4:12:11] <+Lelric> the crowbar is slower
[4:12:12] <blackkanye> Higher the speed the more time it takes to use attacks
[4:12:13] <TomFrank> a crowbar can do everything a shovel and a hammer can do
[4:12:13] <+griffball13> go crowbar
[4:12:13] <%heartlesshealer> I'd take flashlight, but I tend to think out of combat stuff
[4:12:14] <CrowbarFacelift> My namesake won't steer you wrong
[4:12:16] <+luftraumm1> hit chance
[4:12:16] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Why is low speed better?
[4:12:17] <tranquilturnips> @PapaGravestone closer to losing

[4:12:17] <%XzileGaming> ask this man what hed recommend for murder
[4:12:18] <gekizenbu> @LordSDB attacks are done on a time bar

[4:12:22] <%rdark_ksu> when shall we ascend to the power of gun
[4:12:22] <CrowbarFacelift> bark bark
[4:12:23] <splatty1> how much does a prep attack take?
[4:12:23] <%heartlesshealer> it CAN be
[4:12:24] <+VanaSkiller> bork bork
[4:12:24] <%Jekado> 2 handed str based
[4:12:25] <+Lelric> speed is how much of the time bar is taken up per attack

[4:12:31] <blackkanye> in the right build
[4:12:32] <+Skelegroove> I assume speed is how much points it takes to swing
[4:12:33] <+JavaManJoJo> if I understand, speed is how much it take of your action bar in a turn chat
[4:12:35] <Monkeyweed21> hammer is hummer
[4:12:38] <DozzLock> Hammer just got nerfed fool
