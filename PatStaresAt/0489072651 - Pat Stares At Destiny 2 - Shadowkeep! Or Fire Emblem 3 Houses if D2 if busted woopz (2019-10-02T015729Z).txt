[0:33:50] <Marpolo13> hand cannon all right
[0:33:50] <%Ninestempest> it is a special hand cannon
[0:33:53] <%MonsieurHedge> can i just run up to people and shotgun them to death
[0:33:53] <ExpressNode> Do you enjoy this or Borderlands 3 better?
[0:33:54] <%Ascethetic> what handcannon is that?
[0:33:57] <%rumtumtugnutz> go kick Zur in the pud
[0:33:57] <%Laecerelius> Fight those fucking moon wizards, Pat!
[0:34:00] <%Ninestempest> it's a pre-order bonus lol
[0:34:02] <%DukeAtomic> It's a special weapon hand cannon
[0:34:05] <%GarbageNirvana> apatBig blams
[0:34:05] <Yummy_Nukes> sound on the moon? 0/10
[0:34:08] <Corporate_Redeemer> IT'S EFFECTIVE AGAINST LIVING THINGS
[0:34:11] <%ScreamLord> @ExpressNode He hasn't played BL3 yet
[0:34:12] <Aydarkzero> @Ascethetic Eriana's Vow
[0:34:13] <%DukeAtomic> It's from Rank 25 this season if you're F2P
[0:34:13] <+emperri> poopette
[0:34:14] <+TheShisno> These wizards came from the moon
[0:34:19] <LeftOverPizza13> it's basically a sniper rifle receiver
[0:34:27] <jestrfestr> they buffed the damage to minor mobs on hand cannons by like 40% or some shit
[0:34:29] <%rumtumtugnutz> Where are the whalers?
[0:34:30] <Ner234> IT'S FINE
[0:34:31] <%dekkitout> Eirana's Vow is a handcannon of handcannons
[0:34:31] <+TheShisno> The Traveler made it like that
[0:34:32] <%Saltmeisterr> ok is the story in this game good?
[0:34:34] <%startstoprepeat> the traveller did it
[0:34:35] <%starotter70> The moon is magic
[0:34:43] <%SolverCODO> some sound would transfer through the ground right?
[0:34:45] <%ScreamLord> @AngriestPat How do you already have the new Exotic SNiper Handcanon?
[0:34:46] <%MonsieurHedge> space magic, i aint gotta explain shit
[0:34:46] <+RowenCleric> Do Space Wizards magic their poop away too?
[0:34:52] <%Ascethetic> its the Halo 1 pistol
[0:34:56] <%legendfather_of_giants> @ScreamLord free for buying
[0:34:58] <%GarbageNirvana> Why come his hand cannon got that icon on it
[0:34:58] <%FirearmsInstructor> Is this a borderlands??? D:
[0:35:04] <ExpressNode> @ScreamLord I thought I heard him mention it but I guess I'm mis-remembering
[0:35:11] <%MonsieurHedge> did they nerf well of radiance yet
[0:35:11] <%Saltmeisterr> or is the story just acceptable?
[0:35:13] <%the_mental_punk> Resident evil 8 should be on the moon
[0:35:17] <%starotter70> @RowenCleric They just let it float away into the void
[0:35:18] <%startstoprepeat> @AngriestPat autos got a ~25% pve damage increase so it balances out
[0:35:27] <betrayed_llama> @garbagenirvana It does extra sheild damage
[0:35:29] <%dekkitout> Pat, your ginger bias is showing Kappa
[0:35:29] <+RowenCleric> ah ok that makes sense too
[0:35:38] <+TheShisno> I mean if the Traveler can make Mercury a garden world and Venus habitable AT ALL, moon air is nothing
[0:35:41] <%GarbageNirvana> ooo
[0:35:46] <Corporate_Redeemer> @Saltmeisterr It's a lot better than Destiny 1 and vanilla D2. The story is more like Dark Souls though, with stuff being told in items and lore books ingame
[0:35:49] <%ScreamLord> @legendfather_of_giants You get it for buying Shadowkeep? That's actually kinda cool
[0:35:49] <%DukeAtomic> @GarbageNirvana it has an enchantment that lets it break specific shields and overpenetrate
[0:35:52] <%Ninestempest> @Saltmeisterr year 1 story is bad. year 2 story is great. year 3 story is slower, but still great.
[0:35:56] <bruno_silv0> yo what hand cannon is this?
[0:35:58] <%griffball13> ULIMITED POWER
[0:36:04] <%starotter70> In space, no one can hear you shit
[0:36:06] <+Garrosh_Heckscream> POWAAAAAAH
[0:36:09] <%GarbageNirvana> Well that's rad
[0:36:17] <%DeathsDoom> LIMITED POWER
[0:36:21] <%MonsieurHedge> oh very nice
[0:36:30] <bruno_silv0> the damage on thats seema stupid
[0:36:31] <%CrimsonCore90> Is this sponsored?
[0:36:37] <%demegodz> Cheer100 Cheer100 Cheer100 Cheer100 Cheer100 Seems like stream ate my sub message. I could not mind at ALL if you stream Destiny all week and 734 people here would probably agree. Hope these bits fuel some shit you can buy from eververse to make your Destiny Dolls pretty
[0:36:38] <Aydarkzero> Crota is a bitch
[0:36:39] <+emperri> stupped
[0:36:42] <%Saltmeisterr> ok
[0:36:42] <%SolverCODO> Who will fill Crota's void?
[0:36:43] <%legendfather_of_giants> dont let him hear that
[0:36:45] <%XeroSigmaPrime> ENERGY
[0:36:45] <%Ninestempest> it's a special weapon hand cannon, that is why it is stupid
[0:36:49] <SGrim> Crota "was" a bitch
[0:36:50] <%ScreamLord> And his dad was a bigger bitch
[0:36:54] <%MonsieurHedge> so is crota hot orrrrr
[0:36:55] <+horothgar4> seriously, thats just lunaris from the new ducktales
[0:36:56] <%kyh9> If you were PResident of Nintend, REggie Filsamee, what studio would you try to buy to secure Nintendo's dominance?
[0:36:56] <Aydarkzero> that was 6 points better!
[0:36:57] <%startstoprepeat> i kinda figured savathun was the new big bad
[0:37:00] <%Ninestempest> crota is not very hot ngl
[0:37:02] <RahuHordika> lul
[0:37:02] <+TheShisno> Just remember that Shadowkeep purchases unlock the class's middle tree just like Forsaken
[0:37:03] <%cylish> that was an upgrade
[0:37:03] <%Ninestempest> his daddy tho
[0:37:04] <%Monkeyweed21> Is that the guy from Ducktales?
[0:37:06] <Aydarkzero> number stay THE SAME
[0:37:06] <%Jeemukun> I don't know who that guy is, but the way he talks remind me of zapp braniggan
[0:37:07] <RahuHordika> that was higher level Pat
[0:37:08] <betrayed_llama> DONT dismantle blues PAT
[0:37:12] <%demegodz> @AngriestPat Keep Blues since they are now at higher power level
[0:37:12] <%XeroSigmaPrime> NAH THAT WAS ALWAYS THERE
[0:37:22] <shotgunmccooter> don't dismantle till you get to 900!!!
[0:37:23] <Corporate_Redeemer> PAT, BLUES ARE BETTER NOW
[0:37:30] <%Ninestempest> @AngriestPat blues will be your best power until you hit 900 and can start upgrading
[0:37:32] <%informedotaku> BLUES GOOD!
[0:37:36] <+kungfauxboi> whats happening?

[0:37:38] <+emperri> isn't crota that astolfo from soul eater
[0:37:42] <Yummy_Nukes> i wish bungie would remake Oni
[0:37:45] <Aydarkzero> Blues are a god send when starting expansions
[0:37:57] <3xgilly> I really want to play this but I cannot play PC D2 on wifi....
[0:38:04] <%starotter70> Would Zero Gravity sex be good or not?
[0:38:11] <%legendfather_of_giants> would not recommend for pvp
[0:38:17] <+TheShisno> Cause it's not on
[0:38:18] <%dekkitout> Being p2p, Destiny does not take kindly to packet loss
[0:38:19] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AngriestPat its done
[0:38:20] <%ScreamLord> @emperri No, you're thinking of Crona
[0:38:22] <+emperri> BURNING!!!
[0:38:26] <%LiquidShake83> it takes special ammo tho BibleThump

[0:38:44] <%Ninestempest> knight's swords
[0:38:49] <%valriot> @angriestpat Gun uses special ammo, it's basically a mini sniper
[0:38:52] <%Laecerelius> Hit them with your swooord!
[0:38:54] <Corporate_Redeemer> It's done
[0:38:55] <%Ninestempest> pattttt stop sitting on the same oneeeee

[0:39:12] <%demegodz> @AngriestPat Move to the others, done with that one
[0:39:14] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AngriestPat they have a control zone indicator

[0:40:51] <%LiquidShake83> did you equip your ERIS MORN Shell?
[0:41:05] <fruit_pie_the_magician> This game just doesn't look fun for some reason
[0:41:08] <betrayed_llama> than*
[0:41:12] <%Dr00_PhD> wow i haven't seen destiny in forever cuz that finisher thing is completely new to me
[0:41:14] <%valriot> Breakneck is still great though, it's arguably better or on par with its previous performance due to auto rifle buff
[0:41:26] <%solidousstream> hey @angriestpat where in Des 2 were you like this is fun again?
[0:41:31] <%Divryne> NO HITMARKER.
[0:41:32] <%Fynale> well you're supposed to use tank on this fight
[0:41:32] <%demegodz> ALL YOU
[0:41:32] <%Ninestempest> LMAO
[0:41:34] <%MonsieurHedge> so is there a reason the moon bug men use swords instead of space guns
[0:41:35] <%demegodz> PAT IS GOD
[0:41:36] <+emperri> wow pat keeps oneshotting everything with rockets
[0:41:44] <TheHamwall125> All him! PogChamp

[0:42:42] <%WackyGear> @AngriestPat as someone who doesn't play destiny, who is eris?
[0:42:43] <KishinGrek> sdid you debate between this or Warframes Expansion?
[0:42:45] <%ryome> Why does Ordis sound weird?
[0:42:47] <%Fynale> look at this anime shit
[0:43:08] <%Monkeyweed21> You think the moon is a perfrect society
[0:43:11] <%Fynale> tanks control like ass on keyboard in this game
[0:43:15] <%Ninestempest> Eris is someone who got stuck in the moon for a long ass time and as such knows it like the back of her handa nd knows all about hive magic
[0:43:16] <Thelovelybison> The Tanks are Cayde coloured PepeHands
[0:43:18] <%Quigsies> Ok how long have they had tanks
[0:43:21] <%grayjammer> CAH
[0:43:24] <LaughingCatt> Tanks are car
[0:43:27] <%MonsieurHedge> cayde is the guy who's dead right

[0:43:36] <%MasterDecoder> @Quigsies Since Vanilla D2

[0:43:39] <%Fynale> @Quigsies we've always had tanks we used them in the d2 main campaign
[0:43:39] <%BoboDaHobo> this tank reminds me of battle engine aquila
[0:43:39] <%carlyle1337> !discord
[0:43:41] <%MonsieurHedge> i know nothing about destiny except peter dinkledge might be in it and Cayde 6 is dead
[0:43:43] <3xgilly> @Quigsies since the beginning of D2
[0:43:45] <%Animorphimagi> Pat LOVES the tank controls
[0:43:47] <bruno_silv0> yo that music tho
[0:43:52] <+emperri> ogre tactics
[0:43:54] <%carlyle1337> where is muh discord link?
[0:44:01] <%ScreamLord> @AngriestPat Considering the entire Hive ideology is "KILL KILL KILL" I'm surprised anything of them know how to build anything
[0:44:03] <%Quigsies> Ah, I've only played 1. Thanks to all who responded <3
[0:44:08] <%juxtest> Is this Halo in Space?

[0:46:34] <Corporate_Redeemer> @ScreamLord It's the big dick Hive lords and gods that either do all of the building or have the weaker Hive build stuff. They're all about the FIGHT FIGHT but they have mad respect towards those that are toughest in either might or brains. The Hive respect smarts just as much as might but only when it comes to violent brains.

[0:57:04] <%dekkitout> Remember that one time when like thousands of Guardians went to the moon to fight Crota- then he killed ALL OF THEM CoolStoryBob
[0:57:05] <+emperri> yeah well warframe hasn't gotten content in a year so
[0:57:06] <captainspauldin> unstable iessence is a damage boost against nightmares
[0:57:14] <DraxTD> Kill them all, Pat

[0:57:34] <Corporate_Redeemer> The thing with the Hive is that they can never truly die 100%. If their Throne World is big enough then they can come back over time or be resurrected by a Hive ritual
[0:57:35] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> Ye the handcannon is lit
[0:57:37] <%SolverCODO> This seems.... not designed for single player

[1:01:18] <%NovaKnightmare> thats DC fucking Douglas?
[1:01:20] <+aslfrasle> Why does your character sound like Master Chief?
[1:01:21] <%SolverCODO> Yes let's open the BIG EVIL more by going into it
[1:01:23] <%Charuzu> that is such a bad idea

[1:01:28] <+mgskomododragon> @AngriestPat dont you still owe her a ship?
[1:01:30] <%rumtumtugnutz> You gotta drink the pyramid juice
[1:01:32] <%juxtest> Turns outs its just the ancient ruins of Lunar Disney
[1:01:32] <LaughingCatt> That seems like a BAD idea
[1:01:34] <LaughingCatt> lets do it
[1:01:36] <%XeroSigmaPrime> I like how your guardian sounds like MASTER CHIEF\
[1:01:38] <ooblag> Is she supposed to have goo coming out of her eyeballs? cause she got goo in her eyeballs
[1:01:39] <Yummy_Nukes> I'm too enamored with your crown to pay attention to plot
[1:01:45] <%dekkitout> Not even Shin Malphur would want near that crazy pyramid...
[1:01:45] <%Divryne> MOOOOON.
[1:01:46] <%Puhff> Well she seems friendly and helpful and will totally not betray you later!
[1:01:48] <%startstoprepeat> ehh, you know the ships are on the way anyway, doing some research only helps
[1:01:49] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> That does sound like Steve Downes? That's Master Chief right
[1:01:50] <Corporate_Redeemer> Eris literally ripped the Darkness out of some Hive and put it inside her to live. She can totally chill next to the Darkness and be fine.
[1:01:54] <%MonsieurHedge> whoops i turned on the Doom Pyramid
[1:01:57] <%MonsieurHedge> my bad
[1:02:00] <+silvery_cricket> This is the plot of Alien Vs Predator

[1:02:30] <$megamonmon123> is dracul also on the moon?
[1:02:32] <%startstoprepeat> all sidearms are bad

[1:02:58] <@lewdskeletor13> Why don’t we simply blow up the moon?
[1:03:02] <%rumtumtugnutz> Are there whalers on the moon and, as a follow-up, do they carry a harpoon?

[1:03:06] <Oxybe> Pat has gun. He'll be fine on haunted moon.
[1:03:06] <%gekizenbu> if the sun is haunted and the moon is haunted, where can we go that is unhaunted
[1:03:09] <%Ninestempest> that's just the way to the area you just saw that cutscene in
[1:03:12] <Yummy_Nukes> moon spooks

[1:03:58] <%rumtumtugnutz> Isn't China planning on building their own moon?
[1:04:07] <$i_am_therydon> use transient curse pat.
[1:04:09] <$megamonmon123> what if the ghosts bite a vampire who then bites a skeleton?
[1:04:09] <%legendfather_of_giants> app works for me @AngriestPat
[1:04:09] <%TheNommad> TheNommad subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 7 months! Is D2 worth checking out for a former Warframe player?

[1:04:28] <%startstoprepeat> api's changed so the app'll take awhile to catch up
[1:04:33] <%Charuzu> hhaha
[1:04:36] <Oxybe> Ohshit.jpg should we call the pope to bless his bullets? just dump them in the holy water and have him give them a mouth swish?
[1:04:38] <xxshadowxx416> have weasel cant log in
[1:04:39] <ape_hawk> is this better than petting elmo?
[1:04:42] <LeftOverPizza13> 2000 hour warframe player here and i love this game
[1:04:43] <%TheNommad> Thanks Pat, I'll go check out Diablo 2 then
[1:04:51] <LaughingCatt> Destinablo?
[1:05:00] <%SirGO0SE> when i last played it was still on bnet, i NEED to find a quick get up to pace guide
[1:05:01] <Yummy_Nukes> @angriest pat do get to explore other areas of earth besides the tower?
[1:05:11] <WeebFever> Diablestiny
[1:05:20] <%SolverCODO> Do I hear Director Trench on the hotline in the background?
[1:05:35] <%ChaosAethr> Was that Zodiark
[1:05:36] <$megamonmon123> so is destiny 2 the best looter shooter out right now?
[1:05:40] <IndoorSitup> Just restarted this game and they totally changed the intro. Now it's a remade version of the intro from Destiny 1
[1:05:48] <%legendfather_of_giants> @Yummy_Nukes there's a whole earth zone, and some story missions and one raid take place in the city
[1:05:58] <LaughingCatt> Zodiark is less of a pyramid
[1:05:59] <%Agami23> but pat, what if that stuff was useful? it was all purple
[1:06:01] <%demegodz> Yes it is
[1:06:03] <%Puhff> :o
[1:06:06] <TomDanksEGOT> y the F cant i link my amazon prime acct w/ twitch.... this is getting frustrating
[1:06:08] <waifoong98> none of them is good LUL
[1:06:08] <$megamonmon123> damn thats high praise
[1:06:11] <%dekkitout> It doesn't cause some consoles to overheat, so yeah
[1:06:15] <Yummy_Nukes> @legendfather_of_giants thanks
[1:06:16] <%Agami23> wait you can just remake stuff? thats nuts
[1:06:24] <+Pigg1yJuffs> Pat. Breakdown so much of that shit. Your bank should not be that damn full.
[1:06:24] <nawleenspoboy> no anthem
[1:06:24] <%demegodz> Vaulting is a thing
[1:06:26] <%startstoprepeat> what about anthem tho
[1:06:26] <ape_hawk> is this game better than crack?
[1:06:32] <%SirGO0SE> warframe needs a way to balance for pvp and slow things down
[1:06:34] <%Puhff> True enough. It just takes a reeeally long time to be "done".
[1:06:35] <Corporate_Redeemer> But Pat, what about Diablo Immortal?
[1:06:38] <3dbee> the word "legendary" has no meaning in this context
[1:06:39] <onetrueking27> god dammit, i should get back into destiny
[1:06:40] <LaughingCatt> That is depressingly true about Warframe
[1:06:41] <rbakervv> i want to play this, con't log in though
[1:06:42] <$megamonmon123> anthem was more like a whispered pledge

[1:06:53] <%dekkitout> Warframe and pvp in the same sentence, I have now seen it all
[1:06:53] <xxshadowxx416> warframe no end game destiny 2
[1:06:55] <waifoong98> @SirGO0SE well wait til they fix hos migration first lol
[1:06:56] <+Order_of_Mystery> anthem sucks, and bioware deserves all of the scorn for how bad it sucks
[1:06:56] <%Big_Dream> @AngriestPat what about fallout 76
[1:06:58] <Oxybe> Barderlands 3
[1:06:58] <ape_hawk> pat what about the popular schlooter, memerlands 3?
[1:06:59] <%Puhff> Don't tempt me Pat
[1:06:59] <%Charuzu> and that is the standard response to that question
[1:07:02] <TomDanksEGOT> Warframe needs an endgame
[1:07:03] <Onmi_Khaos> I never thought anything would take FFXIV's spot as " Horrid launch MMO"
[1:07:06] <%grayjammer> Don't have much I wanna do in warframe anymore, but I'll go back for Grendel i guess.
[1:07:07] <Onmi_Khaos> But GOD DAMN Anthem did it
[1:07:09] <%starotter70> Everything is fine
[1:07:10] <Corporate_Redeemer> FART GAS
[1:07:11] <%Agami23> the most i've seen of destiny 2 was achievement hunter getting real mad at the raid
[1:07:12] <$megamonmon123> @ape_hawk fun to play but story is ass
[1:07:16] <TomDanksEGOT> Division 2 is a pretty good looter shooter as well
[1:07:17] <%Ninestempest> she did not fuck it up, she was just looking when it got fucked up
[1:07:17] <+Rodzzila> Is this game easy to get in or a wiki hell like warframe?
[1:07:18] <+HaunchPaunch> No offense but BL3 is a solid looter shooter
[1:07:23] <%gekizenbu> is that Ermac
[1:07:23] <%SirGO0SE> @dekkitout i played a couple rounds of it and couldnt even fathom how many changes theyd have to make to balance it/make it fun
[1:07:30] <+NeonLight> They released story bits before the game, sounds like she was tricked
[1:07:39] <%Agami23> @HaunchPaunch a solid 5 fps looter shooter
[1:07:40] <%Monkeyweed21> THE HOOKER BOOTS ARE A NIGHTMARE
[1:07:43] <ape_hawk> is the story in destiny 2 good or eh?
[1:07:46] <%dekkitout> The Fanatic is a necromancer, how is he a ghost...
[1:07:57] <Dovakhin573> is that ermac??
[1:07:58] <+ausl0> Sam "Ermac" Fisher
[1:08:01] <%tacmare> Cause the moon's haunted.
[1:08:03] <%tacmare> Duh.

[1:10:23] <+Masutasodo> If I could only get one of the expansions for the time being, should I get forsaken or shadowkeep?
[1:10:27] <Corporate_Redeemer> Byf is the man you want if you need some lore knowledge dumped on you
[1:10:28] <+emperri> @AngriestPat how do your mind goblins let you play games like this and warframe with shit you can just miss forever

[1:10:52] <%Agami23> @AngriestPat is destiny 2 a good first person shooter? does the gun feel good to shoot?
[1:11:01] <%dekkitout> The stuff you miss in Destiny is mostly cosmetic
[1:11:10] <%Ninestempest> the gunplay is the best part of destiny by far
[1:11:16] <betrayed_llama> You missed the solstice armor
[1:11:21] <%demegodz> @Agami23 I can personally tell you that the gunplay is one of the best things about the game
[1:11:23] <+Pigg1yJuffs> How much have you watched of Byf @angriestpat ? I need to know how much lore you have consumed.

[1:15:01] <LaughingCatt> I wonder why the Moon is the occult spooky zone
[1:15:01] <%Laecerelius> The moon is filled with fart gas

[1:15:12] <%Monkeyweed21> JUMP IN COWARD
[1:15:23] <%crimsonharvest> You know that fuckin big red tower, I maintain it's just one of those fucking boring Oblivion towers
[1:15:40] <Oxybe> So purple is just just a shade of blue who got noticed by senpai?
[1:15:47] <%Chatterbox1991> Is thaT Gruntilda's Lair?
[1:15:52] <%SirGO0SE> ya ya ya redbull time
[1:16:00] <xxshadowxx416> senpai red dante
[1:16:03] <$megamonmon123> @oxybe yeah basically
[1:16:15] <Aydarkzero> so i finished the campaign just now wow thats weird
[1:16:17] <+Order_of_Mystery> did all wizards come from the moon?
[1:16:33] <%crimsonharvest> I just played this part of the game for two hours and all I learned is that my friends are bad at communicating or staying together
[1:16:35] <LaughingCatt> I have high hopes for this expansion, as it also has Shadow in its name
[1:16:46] <$realm_forge> Make sure to hit every rock on the way
[1:16:46] <Oxybe> Can we make artificial wizards if we bring moon rocks back to earth?
[1:16:49] <%Starlight_Gamer> whats that saurman tower over there?
[1:16:54] <xxshadowxx416> shadow cool
[1:17:00] <zipfile777> soo, is this even worth try?
[1:17:04] <$realm_forge> BE AFRAID TO ENGAGE THE HIVE
[1:17:08] <%crimsonharvest> thats a Mehrunes Dagon tower from Oblivion TES4
[1:17:09] <%supercasualboom> Wait, this isn’t RAID...SHADOW LEGENDS!!!!! 🤣
[1:17:13] <%SlimeSlimeSlime> Engage the hive? But I have commitment issues. =/
[1:17:14] <xxshadowxx416> yes worth a try
[1:17:17] <Yummy_Nukes> wait a minute, why do space wizards need guns?
[1:17:20] <Mister_McDerp> looks like isengard
[1:17:23] <%Quigsies> @zipfile777 It's free, so you've got nothing to lose but time
[1:17:25] <%demegodz> @AngriestPat Look for red blobs
[1:17:28] <xxshadowxx416> just do raid there fun
[1:17:31] <%gekizenbu> why would you not want a gun
[1:17:40] <+Tokanova> moons haunted is why
[1:17:41] <%starotter70> A gun is basically just a wand
[1:17:46] <%supercasualboom> GUN
[1:17:50] <Oxybe> Space wizards needs guns bercause otherwise the moon ghosts and the solar commies win
[1:17:52] <%SirGO0SE> thats the kind of question that gets you capped
[1:17:53] <zipfile777> i dont have 105 Gb of space LUL
[1:17:53] <%Charuzu> y'know that answer actually makes an amount of sense
[1:17:54] <xxshadowxx416> a gun wand
[1:17:56] <%shurtal> if you could cast spels AND SHOOT GUNS, you wouldn't choose to only cast spells
[1:18:00] <%Monkeyweed21> Nothing is stronger than a wizard with a gun
[1:18:02] <+Pigg1yJuffs> And if you believe they can destroy the universe, then the gun will.
[1:18:14] <%demegodz> @AngriestPat Red blobs for enemy spawns
[1:18:14] <%HyraFukit> A bullet is the strongest spell.
[1:18:22] <theredfox930000> hey big P what's up
[1:18:25] <%demegodz> They will spawn Nightmares
[1:18:30] <Oxybe> Can't counterspell a .44
[1:18:33] <Yummy_Nukes> i don't know, I'd rather just shoot lightning from my hands all the time if i could
[1:18:37] <%starotter70> @Monkeyweed21 Yeah, remember when Dumbledore capped a Death Eater in Harry Potter 5
[1:18:38] <+Tokanova> why does that pistol make water gun noises
[1:18:47] <%demegodz> GIVE JUICE

[2:10:10] <CrystulSkul> Thought u said pregnant
[2:10:23] <Yummy_Nukes> @angriestpat what's the deal with ginger girls and skeletons? last month i saw a ginger girl driving on the highway with a skeleton in her passenger seat
[2:10:25] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> LOL Just gonna skip right over "Goth Mom"
[2:10:29] <+NeonLight> Raisins. Seriously, who does that?!
[2:10:30] <%thegreenbenis> Paige is pregnant?
[2:10:43] <%dekkitout> If you think that's dumb, wait till you get a load of the literal wish-dragons

[2:11:10] <%rumtumtugnutz> thats a dirty lie
[2:11:23] <%thegreenbenis> @ShichiNoBushi Paige doesn't know how to drive.
[2:11:37] <Yummy_Nukes> @angriestpat I'm super serious, saw her on my way home from work
[2:11:38] <Corporate_Redeemer> @Yummy_Nukes It's because they can mutually bond over the fact that neither of them have souls. Kappa
[2:11:38] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Paige has a license. Pat does not
[2:11:56] <%Charuzu> stomache to bag...what a journey
[2:12:03] <%Malikial> GUESS WHAT FUCKERS, DAD'S HOME!
[2:12:22] <+redribbonvinny> I'm so happy you missed out on the shitshow that was the first 4 hours of launch
[2:12:39] <mankeyfigh> @angriest So is game officially good now?
[2:12:41] <waifoong98> @redribbonvinny how bad was it
[2:12:54] <$GoogleyGareth> I remember playing the Destiny 1 raid for the first time. Such great memories.
[2:12:59] <Yummy_Nukes> @corporate_redeemer LUL
[2:13:08] <+redribbonvinny> @waifoong98 they had to do "emergency server maintenance"
[2:13:17] <waifoong98> @redribbonvinny LUL
[2:13:33] <%Malikial> He's a hive daddy?

[2:15:04] <%dekkitout> Thanks a lot, Eris
[2:15:05] <+redribbonvinny> moons haunted
[2:15:24] <%Monkeyweed21> THE NIGHTMARE OF REUSED ASSETS
[2:15:33] <%Malikial> Moon vampires?
[2:15:44] <FutaSnek> Nasa put the ghosts there #wakeupsheeple
[2:15:45] <%korth367> @AngriestPat yo pat did you see the terminator gameplay trailer for mk11 yet
[2:15:51] <ShichiNoBushi> Haunted by the ghost of that one guy the other guy on the moon killed.
[2:16:00] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Recycling is good for the environment
[2:16:01] <%Charuzu> haunted assests
[2:16:13] <%korth367> shit was dope tho
[2:16:18] <+redribbonvinny> I wish they had kept that guns original name.
[2:16:18] <%CherrieVelvet> so it's a recurring nightmare? NotLikeThis
[2:16:45] <Oxybe> how hauted is the moon? like 4 ghosts?
[2:17:00] <+hitorio> about 100 dollars
[2:17:02] <mistergrim07> Eris is a hunter who uses space magic
[2:17:02] <ShichiNoBushi> 666 vieweres.
[2:17:07] <FutaSnek> Like 8/10 haunteds
[2:17:09] <%dekkitout> So how does the Terminator character react to the combat in MK since he's as lively as a toaster?
[2:17:12] <%Monkeyweed21> 4,000,000 dead ghosts
[2:17:18] <LeftOverPizza13> the haunting spreads
[2:17:22] <+ZephynM> I was thinking about playing Destiny 2 since it's on Steam now for free.
[2:17:23] <Sullry> Wait they added quests for johtun and the bow now?
[2:17:34] <%Monkeyweed21> @Sullry yep
[2:17:37] <Oxybe> :O
[2:17:37] <%Charuzu> like genocide level haunted
[2:17:46] <%Malikial> Pat, you have a favorite gun type in this?
[2:17:48] <%Charuzu> it's on free
[2:17:48] <Yummy_Nukes> you need your driver's license
[2:17:50] <Sullry> Didn’t know. Got mine the old way.
[2:17:52] <%Monkeyweed21> the ghosts are haunted
[2:17:59] <+redribbonvinny> @sullry really? too bad I already have them
[2:18:00] <%mh9s> large haunts, big spooks
[2:18:01] <ShichiNoBushi> Free to Steam
[2:18:11] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> I actually like the phrase "On Free"
[2:18:17] <FutaSnek> Haunted Ghosts monkaS
[2:18:24] <%Malikial> I mean, he is also not attacking you at all.
[2:18:32] <%Deadpal> skull menas he's way higher power than you
[2:18:33] <%Basch71> hauntings make you real fucking tanky LuL
[2:18:33] <+donpatrondx> he's just standing there... menacingly
[2:18:35] <Corporate_Redeemer> Destiny reusing assests makes sense a bit. The Hive are all about dying and resurrecting. The Vex are machine Hive Mind and can just rebuild themselves unless they get completely wiped or are stuck in time like in the Vault of Glass. The Fallen and Cabal never come back though except for when they either get Frankensteined with tech or are the victims of Necromancy
[2:18:35] <%Deadpal> at least 20 points higher
[2:18:36] <%Malikial> ...
[2:18:37] <FutaSnek> YOU EAT THE SHIT SER

[2:19:43] <SubliminaIMessages> Is that the Halo 1 pistol?
[2:19:49] <LeftOverPizza13> yeah it's basically the sniper receiver without the barrel and butt
[2:19:52] <FutaSnek> Its like a cannon, in your hand
[2:20:01] <FutaSnek> A ... cannonhand
[2:20:04] <FutaSnek> Yeah
[2:20:13] <+NeonLight> This is Taniks' old ketch

[2:20:29] <ButtDickus> wait i know this place
[2:20:29] <%dekkitout> Huh- come to think of it, that has been the case since like Taken King and the Cabal
[2:20:31] <%JetpackMcQuack> like pizza if pizza were a gun
[2:20:34] <+redribbonvinny> Taniks has no house...
[2:20:53] <geckko12> taniks DansGame
[2:21:04] <FutaSnek> @JetpackMcQuack Pizza gun sounds messy LUL
[2:21:05] <Sullry> Taniks is pretty cool, robot arm, cool cape for hunters, killed the hunter vanguard, all around swell guy
[2:21:18] <geckko12> can that guy stay dead now
[2:21:25] <%Malikial> Pat the vappy boi?
[2:21:30] <zv1neda> how's armor 2.0 like it or dislike it? @angriestpat
[2:21:35] <ButtDickus> taniks will never stay dead
[2:21:40] <xelshion> !uptime
[2:21:41] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 21m.
[2:21:49] <%dekkitout> Taniks is too cybernetic to die
[2:21:54] <Sullry> Yep
[2:22:05] <Fuji_Apples> what exotic gun is that
[2:22:06] <$realm_forge> Do you have all your subclass trees unlocked
[2:22:16] <+redribbonvinny> so many stats now its amazing
[2:22:57] <%legendfather_of_giants> forges are easy peasy now
[2:23:09] <%dekkitout> Too bad you missed the weeks where Menagerie was dropping 3-4 times more loot
[2:23:09] <Sullry> Bruh
[2:23:16] <geckko12> you played forsaken stories, youre fine
[2:23:19] <%Agami23> @AngriestPat seeing you play gambit was enough to make me interested in this game.
[2:23:25] <%Monkeyweed21> did you at least unlock the super well
[2:23:32] <Sullry> You missed out on some crazy menagerie stuff
[2:23:47] <Kalinflip> 35 bucks huh

[2:24:25] <+redribbonvinny> to be honest watching pat play gambit made me cringe hard
[2:24:44] <ButtDickus> man seeing that battle pass feels really weird everytime
[2:24:54] <%valriot> ERIS, WHAT AM I FIGHTING FOOOOR
[2:24:55] <ShichiNoBushi> ERIIIIIIIIS!! WHAT AM I FIGHTING FOOOOR!!
[2:24:59] <%Monkeyweed21> the sun tells you to cancel their kickstarters
[2:25:37] <%Agami23> is the sun also evil in destiny?
[2:25:50] <zv1neda> LUL
[2:25:51] <Aydarkzero> they got the servers up back kind of fast
[2:25:53] <%dekkitout> No, but it came close to blowing the fuck up
[2:25:54] <Louie_Salmon> I mean, you COULD
[2:25:56] <%Monkeyweed21> you're gonna be late
[2:26:02] <+StrawberryPantsu> Who want's to bet Pat's gunna be late
[2:26:05] <+donpatrondx> everyone wants to hear more about canadian black face politcs
[2:26:07] <%JetpackMcQuack> my code vein got updated, it no longer saws Unreal 4 haha
[2:26:07] <geckko12> as long as it doesnt blow up
[2:26:08] <%legendfather_of_giants> nah solo this strike you're underlevelled for
[2:26:15] <+redribbonvinny> @agami23 considering the fact that it was close to exploding
[2:26:16] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AngriestPat story version is always alone
[2:26:18] <artoflec> Part 5 has really awkward pacing so far
[2:26:22] <%Agami23> gonna have a guest for the podcast? @AngriestPat
[2:26:24] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AngriestPat I would leave and go level
[2:26:36] <Louie_Salmon> @jetpackmcquack Wait like while it's booting up? Did it stop using UE4?
[2:26:37] <%valriot> No it not???
[2:26:42] <$D_day> No it's not
[2:26:43] <KingVantq> I did this coop with randoms
[2:26:48] <geckko12> what? youre not suppose to be alone
[2:26:51] <KingVantq> its not suppose to be solo
[2:26:56] <+Arcaenum> This strike definitely shouldn't be alone
[2:26:56] <%legendfather_of_giants> really? i didn't get matchmade either
[2:27:05] <KingVantq> all strikes have matchmaking
[2:27:20] <Aydarkzero> i got teammates here try again
[2:27:26] <geckko12> wow thats even possibl
[2:27:29] <Yummy_Nukes> oopsies
[2:27:36] <%SirGO0SE> haha everyone is swiping left
[2:27:40] <%JetpackMcQuack> No, just the icon in the task bar haha
[2:27:56] <+Arcaenum> What in the world? It didn't even try to matchmake.
[2:27:58] <%legendfather_of_giants> if it's matchmaking, it should try to search for at least a while
[2:28:03] <KingVantq> maybe because i wasnt on the moon when i started the strike
[2:28:04] <%SirGO0SE> LUL
[2:28:10] <%Monkeyweed21> might be underleveled
[2:28:11] <Louie_Salmon> @jetpackmcquack Oh okay. That's pretty funny too
[2:28:18] <%Segartner> you can get some peeps from your friends lists
[2:28:19] <geckko12> is matchmaking off or what?
[2:28:21] <$realm_forge> Would highly recommend unlocking your warlock kamehameha
[2:28:23] <%Agami23> dont swipe left, instead swipe up to see the sub button and subscibe
[2:28:27] <%Segartner> that's what I did
[2:28:30] <%valriot> Maybe cos you're in your elitist SSD Dimension Kappa Kappa Kappa Kappa
[2:28:31] <Yummy_Nukes> too smol to be noticed
[2:28:31] <KingVantq> try matchmaking from the tower
[2:28:32] <freefa> solo it coward
[2:28:36] <+Arcaenum> I just did this earlier matchmaking should be happening
[2:28:48] <%dekkitout> You would think that, but Destiny has many ways of surprising you
[2:28:53] <%legendfather_of_giants> I just did it like 15 mins ago and got no matchmaking
[2:29:14] <+Arcaenum> This is super weird
[2:29:16] <%Segartner> get 2 friends to do it with you pat, it didn't match matchmade me either
[2:29:25] <%Monkeyweed21> matchmake borked
[2:29:26] <KingVantq> yeah it should send you back to orbit for matchmaking just checked
[2:29:28] <+Astral_Directive> Pretty sure it's a story version of it, fucked me up super hard with the cold entry too
[2:29:42] <+Arcaenum> What's interesting is that when i hover over the strike it says matchmaking on it, but it didn't for Pat.
[2:29:46] <Yummy_Nukes> meow!
[2:29:47] <VJdarkworld> life is borked ;_;
[2:29:52] <%Monkeyweed21> Launch day problems
[2:29:53] <%legendfather_of_giants> try selecting from here?
[2:30:01] <%dekkitout> Moon's borked
[2:30:05] <%legendfather_of_giants> nope
[2:30:10] <%SirGO0SE> thats so weird
[2:30:15] <%Segartner> I think the story version of the strike doesn't machmake you. it didn't for me.
[2:30:16] <Kalinflip> urrf?
[2:30:18] <%SirGO0SE> no it did
[2:30:19] <VJdarkworld> welcome to earf
[2:30:22] <+Scottigecko> loads gun: Moon's borked
[2:30:23] <Kalinflip> brazy talk
[2:30:23] <+Jesus_X_Boredom> Oh. Offbrand Warframe 2 came out on steam today.
[2:30:26] <%Segartner> blind
[2:30:29] <%Monkeyweed21> BLIND
[2:30:29] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AngriestPat story versions of strikes are usually solo, maybe they forgot and had to patch it in?
[2:30:36] <+Arcaenum> Yeah it should say matchmaking right under cooperative, I'm moused over it right now. Granted it's on PS4
[2:30:36] <Kalinflip> @Jesus_X_Boredom whats it called
[2:30:50] <%SirGO0SE> it says coop but no mm
[2:30:56] <%legendfather_of_giants> @Arcaenum you also have completed the story version, though, right?
[2:30:57] <%SirGO0SE> but all the earth shit had it
[2:31:02] <geckko12> weird because i did it with matchmaking
[2:31:03] <Yummy_Nukes> it'll buff out
[2:31:04] <%Segartner> you don't have to do it solo pat. get some friends.
[2:31:25] <+Ursendorf> I just got here, what class is he
[2:31:28] <+Arcaenum> There is no story version @legendfather_of_giants I did the matchmaking version the first time i ever did it.
[2:31:37] <SubliminaIMessages> Kindergarten
[2:31:40] <KingVantq> guess its glitched for you
[2:31:40] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AngriestPat idk how /join works now, but I'll join if I can
[2:31:49] <%dekkitout> Man, there's Moon's Haunted, then there's Gypsy Curse- and this is clearly only one of those
[2:31:55] <+Arcaenum> This strike will definitely be rough solo though.
[2:32:09] <geckko12> its a long strike too
[2:32:12] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AngriestPat It's pretty rough at the right level, you'll get fucked
[2:32:17] <%valriot> Matchmaking probably just borked, it does happen rarely pre-Shadowkeep
[2:32:18] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> bork bork bork
[2:32:27] <%SirGO0SE> patch day always rough
[2:32:32] <Yummy_Nukes> what if you win if you bork it enough?
[2:32:32] <LaughingCatt> reminds me of Stormbork
[2:32:33] <%Segartner> it's not broken dude
[2:32:40] <Gravitus123> i just got here xD
