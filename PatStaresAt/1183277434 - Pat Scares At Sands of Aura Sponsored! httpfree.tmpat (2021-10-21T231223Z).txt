[0:52:16] <%NitronStreams> quality settings are pretty arbitrary
[0:52:23] <+OverzealousEuthanasiast> you need to see the world in 7D before high and extreme can be differentiated
[0:52:35] <Shwepie> 0/10- Game doesn't render ever grain of sand individually.
[0:52:39] <%NitronStreams> it depends entirely on what the dev thinks is acceptable

[0:54:44] <%DXLelouch24> if you do you die
[0:54:53] <+Dakuu75> Can't you just boil the water to clean it?
[0:55:03] <tanarath> Something is big the matter.
[0:55:05] <+RoByte2> If they could clean the oceans in Eva you can deal with a bit of ash in yours
[0:55:06] <yourliteraldog> Water's got a case of the evil
[0:55:07] <%DXLelouch24> no its cursed

[1:15:35] <%cade_calrayn> Paige said the exact same thing
[1:15:42] <%dankjerri> just bring down the steel
[1:15:45] <LoneFonte> "Just tell me what to do"
[1:15:53] <@PeachSaliva> It's very satisfying
[1:15:56] <AbnormalVoid> Isometric
[1:15:59] <%dankjerri> 'eye of god'
[1:16:04] <%KishinGrek> diablo
[1:16:05] <%afronooch> i kinda miss it tbh
[1:16:05] <%baka_sugoi> O L D
[1:16:05] <tanarath> It's a great angle!
[1:16:06] <Spagheddies> Twinstick'y, not quite Isometric kinda thing?
[1:16:06] <Ghufufin> really feels like 3d salt and sanctuary
[1:16:06] <%maskofmichael> I hate this camera angle
[1:16:11] <DaCheekyOne> Baldurs gate
[1:16:11] <%octavian_wolf> this is the old rpg camera
[1:16:13] <%shurtal> Okay, dad
[1:16:15] <Treasure_Vault> Oh no 2005 is old
[1:16:16] <%dankjerri> the diablo camera angle
[1:16:17] <Shwepie> It's the best camera angle.
[1:16:18] <frankavich> This camera angle is just table top
[1:16:18] <draca23> I miss this camera angle. Its why I'm super big on Neverwinter right now
[1:16:20] <+pectusumbra> how was that other diablo like game that's not path of exile on steam? did you end up playing it
[1:16:20] <+TheLocalRival> Lol reminds me of fate LUL LUL LUL
[1:16:22] <@ssjklyco> Tomb Raider was last one I can think of
[1:16:24] <+JustToWatch> PSP games LOVED this camera angle
[1:16:25] <%HaroldDonchee> path of exile was nice
[1:16:25] <T_Sasquatch> Isometric ?
[1:16:26] <+sewermonk> there still are?
[1:16:26] <%Daxalog> I guess that was back when SCALE was a big deal
[1:16:27] <%twistedj3ster> I've always felt uncomfortable by isometrics
[1:16:29] <%cvp5127> old
[1:16:30] <shieldecho> I enjoyed that one camera angle in Nier
[1:16:30] <MicrotonalMatt> PatGrampsAt
[1:16:30] <DaCheekyOne> Dragons age origins
[1:16:31] <+BoocherOnTwitch> its not really isometric because it isnt angled to a grid

[1:17:40] <+BoocherOnTwitch> acab
[1:17:43] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> isometric is pretty strictly 45 degrees and without depth, which is only really done in fully 2d engines

[1:21:08] <owazowski> TRUE
[1:21:12] <Spagheddies> Yeah, no, my fashion has priority over Big Number.
[1:21:13] <Treasure_Vault> Set bonuses are best when they're things you can't get otherwise
[1:21:15] <$realm_forge> Their mortal enemies the Wellbethers will attack you if you wear the whole set
[1:21:18] <Ghufufin> i like set bonuses if they are thematic and of course if they look cool together

[1:28:01] <+EySoyCoco> FF vibes but sandy
[1:28:02] <%Forbidden_Karp> reminds me ofSunless Sea
[1:28:03] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> More fantasy games need fantastical vehicles.
[1:28:09] <@PeachSaliva> haha that's what I said!
[1:28:10] <artificiallynatural> I love sand boats as a concept. They're always so fun to see.
[1:28:10] <karl_rex> MURLOC
[1:28:12] <rosysyntax> that Pikmin looks fucked up
[1:28:14] <%dankjerri> like how you occupy the right lower corner and get his big uninterrupted vista
[1:28:18] <+BoocherOnTwitch> so whats the combat gameplay like?
[1:28:21] <dan_g_v> time to hunt a mountain sized dragon whale
[1:28:22] <%Wallabri> DEEP-SEA FANGLY FISH?
[1:28:28] <%CapnBeefs> They are land anglers
[1:28:31] <NoWayRyanTatum> @rosysyntax that made me spit out my drink

[1:29:33] <%dankjerri> sand is just sand, bro
[1:29:36] <%dankjerri> chill
[1:29:44] <rosysyntax> getting Disco vibes from this voice actor
[1:29:46] <%DXLelouch24> this guy sounds like someone from Disco Elysium
[1:29:48] <%smoothwood07> why does this guys voice remind me of disco?
[1:30:00] <%dankjerri> yeah thats Reptilian Brain
[1:30:06] <+pectusumbra> dehydration. and he does sound a bit like the corpse from disco
[1:30:13] <%DXLelouch24> HE SOUNDS LIKE RETIALIAN BRAIN
[1:30:21] <%DXLelouch24> holy fuck
[1:30:22] <%CappuccinoGuil> @smoothwood07 because it's similar to Reptilian Brain and also the dialogue is presented like Disco
[1:30:23] <%dankjerri> forever and ever, baby!
[1:30:28] <%DXLelouch24> howed you get this guy Ryan
[1:30:38] <+Grayhammatter> whoa

[1:30:47] <%dankjerri> good project and decent pay I'm sure
[1:30:48] <zerointelligence000> weird i thought this would be a crpg
[1:30:50] <rosysyntax> honestly all the VA's so far have been excellent
[1:30:58] <+BoocherOnTwitch> does it have an inner and outer damage radius?
[1:31:06] <+balkonas1> Is this a roguelike or a proper action rpg?
[1:31:07] <%dankjerri> he do a dash
[1:31:07] <KingSpunf> apropos sand, the new Dune is pretty good
[1:31:27] <%dankjerri> reduced damage outside
[1:31:53] <+BoocherOnTwitch> maybe im just crazy but it looks like you hit them with the stick part and it did less damage
[1:31:56] <%dankjerri> hit em
[1:32:14] <+SuperFightinRobot> Ooh are there sweet spots
[1:32:17] <%dankjerri> maybe thats why the weapons are so huge, for sweet spots
[1:32:26] <+SuperFightinRobot> Secret poison
[1:32:38] <%dankjerri> quebecois
[1:32:41] <dan_g_v> candy places?
[1:32:50] <%CapnBeefs> oh no, he is speaking in tongues!!!!

[1:33:37] <%RealThiele> dats a lot of smoke coming from swings

[1:34:07] <%dankjerri> melgom
[1:34:16] <+StromkoPenguin> I think I prefer the fixed camera so long as the world is built around it.

[1:40:10] <%DXLelouch24> itll be cool and you can dab on Ubisoft
[1:40:16] <Sternieliscious> Did that skeleton guy have a death squeak?
[1:40:25] <+izanagi22> Man, I haven't heard the word Ushanka since I played tf2
[1:40:39] <KaitlynnHere> No I think that was Paige cringing
[1:40:58] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> @Sternieliscious So I'm not the only one that heard that.
[1:40:59] <rosysyntax> no healing items?
[1:41:00] <+Grayhammatter> fonbire
[1:41:08] <%pilgrimsayswhat> hey wuddup, hows the game

[1:41:39] <+izanagi22> This game isn't early access is it?
[1:41:49] <+pectusumbra> spend meter
[1:41:49] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> Yes.
[1:41:54] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> It is.
[1:41:56] <Sternieliscious> Skeleton wizard's got a bag of tricks.
[1:42:13] <sauceboss310> sugoiAwawa sugoiAwawa sugoiAwawa sugoiAwawa
[1:42:14] <+Grayhammatter> wow, blasted
[1:42:15] <%Monkeyweed21> LUL
[1:42:15] <AbnormalVoid> Return to Ligma
[1:42:22] <+pectusumbra> do you keep progress in this game?
[1:42:31] <%twistedj3ster> the music reminds me of like...old Disney movies
[1:42:31] <$realm_forge> WASTED
[1:42:40] <%twistedj3ster> I like it
[1:42:41] <CommanderCOOL> @AbnormalVoid lol
[1:43:33] <%smoothwood07> does this game have a babee mode?
[1:43:53] <%doc_ock_rokc> what is this Dota?
[1:45:00] <%skeletonmilk> the lilypad-grass texture is amazing
[1:45:04] <Spagheddies> Arm raised with the sword, yeah. They've been reusing that since DS1.
[1:45:15] <kinkade_77> big sword= cool game
[1:45:32] <+Grayhammatter> so wide
[1:45:48] <Spagheddies> What I like about the Big Sword™ is that it's literally two times as tall as you are.
[1:45:50] <+detbasil> Geek the mage
[1:46:02] <%CatastropheCorvid> Yo this looks dope.
[1:46:08] <+Grayhammatter> bum rushed that mage
[1:46:08] <%CappuccinoGuil> Wait, fuck ALL his ass up? Damn.
[1:46:10] <%octavian_wolf> those immediate 180's look like they feel good
[1:46:22] <%CatastropheCorvid> @CappuccinoGuil All inside his whole ass.
[1:46:24] <rosysyntax> have we seen the counter mechanic used yet?
[1:46:25] <Spagheddies> The WHOLE ass.
[1:46:25] <%CappuccinoGuil> Not just some ass, ALL the ass
[1:46:55] <Spagheddies> Not just the ass, but the whole too.
[1:47:01] <owazowski> Every single inch of that ass
[1:47:09] <WaxWitch> omg lol
[1:47:18] <%CatastropheCorvid> Isn't it strange how "in his ass" sounds far less invasive than "Up his ass?"
[1:47:34] <Mattais88> Who need stunlock when you're swing from a block away
[1:47:51] <%RealThiele> piss attack
[1:48:08] <Spagheddies> I suppose that is a knife for pat.
[1:48:08] <%CatastropheCorvid> So, a spear?
[1:48:18] <%CatastropheCorvid> Bardiche?
[1:48:19] <owazowski> I thinks it's because of the imagery of being up in someone's ass rather and just in @catastrophecorvid
[1:48:20] <SinisterBroccoli> What does the purple bar do?
[1:48:30] <Mattais88> Glaive?
[1:48:40] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt Do you know how many weapons you can discribe as a knife attached to a stick?
[1:48:47] <metabot64> Is this a dark souls?
[1:48:50] <%CatastropheCorvid> @Mattais88 That's the one I was thinking of. Forgot the word.
[1:48:53] <Spagheddies> It's just a zweihander at the end of a spear handle.
[1:48:56] <churropoppa> zweihander!
[1:49:01] <%HaroldDonchee> this weapon needs a whirlwind
[1:49:18] <owazowski> This weapon needs a boomerang throw
[1:49:22] <%doc_ock_rokc> So is this DOTA Darksouls?
[1:49:27] <%RealThiele> sand reapers
[1:49:38] <Spagheddies> More Diablo than Dota.
[1:49:44] <kinkade_77> weapon needs lunar projectile slashes
[1:50:47] <%doc_ock_rokc> I hate sand
[1:51:12] <%doc_ock_rokc> Learning about candis
[1:51:13] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Steve jobs
[1:51:28] <%doc_ock_rokc> @OfficioPrefectusCorgi Who the fuck is steve jobs?
[1:51:29] <%RealThiele> Learning bout Eden
[1:51:37] <%CatastropheCorvid> Can you be a mage?
[1:51:59] <+detbasil> Does seem like it
[1:52:19] <+Grayhammatter> man, it's dark
[1:52:21] <+detbasil> Doesnt
[1:52:39] <rosysyntax> did i see a rest prompt on that stone bridge??
[1:52:40] <Spagheddies> Oh, hey, green. I was wondering when I'd be seeing other colors.
[1:52:43] <%CatastropheCorvid> @doc_ock_rokc I think that dude from that 70's show played him in a movie. Topher Grace?
[1:52:44] <%RealThiele> 2P
[1:52:59] <%CatastropheCorvid> PIllow physics
[1:53:02] <+Grayhammatter> 2P
[1:53:35] <%doc_ock_rokc> @CatastropheCorvid I was hoping for the "Ligma" joke I'm well aware of Steve jobs
[1:53:35] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> You should be able to use a pillow as a weapon and smoother enemies in their sleep.
[1:53:46] <%cobalt_phoenix_> why do i keep hearing gulping sounds
[1:54:01] <%DXLelouch24> why is his head a leaf?

[1:54:14] <+darkco3d> Is this just pc
[1:54:24] <californaya> that rope is locked
[1:54:30] <%doc_ock_rokc> @cooldude69xx AUUUGGGHHH -Explodes-
[1:54:46] <californaya> oh that's a door, nvm
[1:54:53] <%Forbidden_Karp> chest!
[1:55:05] <Jetsfantasy> The music here has a sort of whimsical vibe at times that Star Wars likes to do with its instrumentation. It's interesting
[1:55:06] <spinningchurro> I just got an ad for Norton 360 for Gamers.
[1:55:07] <+Grayhammatter> you did it
[1:55:11] <AbnormalVoid> Yupi
[1:55:14] <Mattais88> Feels like the cave of wonders in Kingdom Hearts
[1:55:34] <%greasypete00> this game reminds me of a demo i played during the demo days called clid the snail
[1:55:34] <%skeletonmilk> the music is SO LOUD
[1:55:48] <+Grayhammatter> wow, music turned loud
[1:55:48] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> I like the dancing guy.

[2:04:04] <%cobalt_phoenix_> here we are
[2:04:05] <%Forbidden_Karp> M O R T I S
[2:04:09] <%Mr_Pylon> new goblin
[2:04:12] <%octavian_wolf> TEA is teh epic of alexander
[2:04:12] <%maskofmichael> sipsipHellmo
[2:04:17] <%Mekhet09> I really need to find a group to do savage with.
[2:04:20] <%octavian_wolf> a super raid in ffxiv
[2:04:26] <%Agami23> @Grokulus The Epic of Alexander
[2:04:30] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> @Grokulus It's a drink made from putting leaves in boiling water, quite popular in England.
[2:04:32] <+london_flexing> Doing T? Pat and his buddies inject testosterone weekly. Got it
[2:04:37] <+Grokulus> ohh, not a ffxiv player
[2:04:38] <%Fooguwu> ive been laying in bed listening, has no one pointed out how fucking LOUD the music gets
[2:04:46] <+cascadepersona> Get that TEA
[2:04:54] <+Grokulus> i dont check out this stream much sorry
[2:05:10] <%octavian_wolf> is there no audio control?
[2:05:33] <%afronooch> leveling to 80 is kinda freeform tbh
[2:05:40] <Vyskus> That's cause you can level idly in your own time
[2:05:41] <Visorak6> hali savage is rough
[2:05:46] <Visorak6> the last 20% especially
[2:05:50] <%CatastropheCorvid> CatastropheCorvid subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 22 months! Hey Pat, would you consider playing Path of Exile for a Mind Goblin stream? The new league drops on Friday. Also, I hope things are less crazy for you all after that crazy neighbour thing.
[2:05:54] <EscoSul> you did it
[2:05:54] <+cascadepersona> I have no friends/static, so I don't do Savage. I do do hunts though.
[2:05:55] <%octavian_wolf> raiding requires long stretches of time, where as leveling you can do in bursts
[2:06:05] <+Grokulus> im a 40h wagie + part time student cant watch twitch often :(
[2:06:12] <%amused_platypus> which class will you get to level 90 1st
[2:06:17] <%NopeBadguy> I don't think anything in the recent tiers is as bad as book phase
[2:06:17] <Visorak6> Yeah my group had three melee as well, ninja just had to accept dps loss
[2:06:25] <BluebunRose> My group is most likely going to start prog on TEA after the release of EW. We did clear UWU last week so I'm happy!
[2:06:25] <%NopeBadguy> Aside from maybe Basic Relativity
[2:06:28] <%NopeBadguy> And Triple Apoc
[2:06:45] <%NopeBadguy> Mostly just Triple Apoc
[2:06:47] <+Grokulus> this music is so soothing
[2:07:08] <%octavian_wolf> yeah, that feels cheap
[2:07:14] <Visorak6> or at least have a way to make them back off
[2:07:16] <+detbasil> There's a chest you just missed
[2:07:25] <%CatastropheCorvid> @Grokulus Reminds me of Kotor in places.
[2:07:29] <tanarath> What if they respond with :) ?
[2:07:43] <%baka_sugoi> psaDogchamp

[2:08:14] <+detbasil> Do you have i frames?
[2:08:29] <Mattais88> That's a really wide spread on that attack
[2:08:44] <%doc_ock_rokc> pat did you get your free 866,666 blood points?
[2:08:47] <+Grokulus> how do you time the rock falls lol
[2:09:01] <+Grokulus> guess the shadow
[2:09:02] <+Grayhammatter> rocked
[2:09:03] <akitanito> look at that tiny pip of damage
[2:09:12] <rosysyntax> rock falls are indicated by water splashes on the ground

[2:12:54] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> @sandrews it's quite a bit.
[2:13:17] <Visorak6> It may be a megaman situation where all the bosses suck ass until you pop one down?
[2:13:24] <%CatastropheCorvid> Beefgate
[2:13:36] <%doc_ock_rokc> @sandrews you can only have 1 million blood points at a time
[2:13:55] <%sandrews> okay I haven't played in a while and don't remember the rate which you can get them
[2:14:11] <%sandrews> @NigelSchnauzerpug @doc_ock_rokc thank you
[2:14:22] <%doc_ock_rokc> @sandrews without boosts you only get 32,000 at a time

[2:15:55] <+UselessBathHouse> peepee boy zangief

[2:17:46] <%Mr_Pylon> I bet it's left shoulder becomes a big laser soon.
[2:18:14] <%Reaped_Psyche> Are there no healing options in game?
[2:18:21] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> I like the sound Ubaani makes.

[2:18:46] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> How do you heal in Hollow Knight? I never played it.
[2:18:58] <%CatastropheCorvid> @NigelSchnauzerpug Charge
[2:18:59] <%MechArch> understandable
[2:19:04] <SomeAsianDood> you collect blood basically
[2:19:10] <Ides42> Healing feels more like Dark souls tbh
[2:19:21] <%Reaped_Psyche> You build up charges of healing during fights
[2:19:23] <%Mr_Pylon> now flee!
[2:19:32] <Mattais88> Go to the next island and it wrecks you right from the start
[2:19:52] <%barkon345> @NigelSchnauzerpug you use your magic meter, which you also use for your other powers. and you can refill it by landing hits
[2:19:57] <%CatastropheCorvid> @Mattais88 Just a single tonberry like enemy.
[2:20:06] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> I hope there's a giant sand worm that can swallow the boat.

[2:21:48] <akitanito> but why
[2:21:53] <%barkon345> wow this game seams f-ing brutal
[2:21:59] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> Why can a skeleton be poisoned?
[2:22:04] <%CappuccinoGuil> Hold on, enemies in a poison area that AREN'T immune to poison? That's illegal.
[2:22:04] <Sternieliscious> Everybody gets to drop into the fart gas!
[2:22:05] <%YakumoYomi> poison poison poison
[2:22:13] <%barkon345> this feels like Dark Souls but harder
[2:22:15] <fistynopunches> yes pat, poison the skeletons
[2:22:16] <+NoriBasket> owned? more like Boned
[2:22:29] <%Forbidden_Karp> I doubt it
[2:22:34] <NoWayRyanTatum> lot of skeletons in this game
[2:22:37] <%barkon345> or I should say this seems like Dark Souls but actually hard
[2:22:51] <%CappuccinoGuil> @NoWayRyanTatum you tell whoever made these enemies take poison damage that they are a good person, a kind person.
[2:22:53] <akitanito> 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
[2:22:57] <fistynopunches> skeletons very cool about poison

[2:23:10] <Visorak6> Is there anything more satisfying than killing enemies via environmental hazards?

[2:23:15] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> @barkon345 Sands of Aurora is the Dark Souls of video games.
[2:23:24] <NoWayRyanTatum> @PeachSaliva was definitely hoping you would appreciate paige lmao
[2:23:32] <akitanito> being able to kick enemies into environmental hazards
[2:23:33] <%CatastropheCorvid> @Visorak6 Killing enemies via well placed exploding hazards.
[2:23:39] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> @Visorak6 A cool parry when you have bad timing in general.
[2:23:42] <@PeachSaliva> @NoWayRyanTatum VERY MUCH
[2:24:06] <Mattais88> @Visorak6 Going back to the starting area with late game gear and wrecking that one monster who screwed you 20+ hours ago

[2:24:27] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> @Mattais88 That IS very satisfying.
[2:24:32] <%CappuccinoGuil> @PeachSaliva how do we feel about decorative drawings/tattoos/magical cracks on skeletons?

[2:28:03] <Mattais88> Bunch of stuff but the one I'm most hopeful is the one about Cute girls playing Hockey while their manager tries to trick them into becoming idols
[2:28:07] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> @PeachSaliva What if it's a tattoo of another skeleton?
[2:28:23] <%CappuccinoGuil> @PeachSaliva Dooope.

[2:37:06] <@PeachSaliva> @dxlelouch24 just a snack until he can have dinner
[2:37:16] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> Toast is boring and lame.
[2:37:17] <akitanito> is it plain toast?
[2:37:20] <%SaiyanShoto> I prefer to just eat a tortilla over toast
[2:37:24] <ne0bunny> we only get upset when you eat uncooked pasta sticks
[2:37:24] <+Basker17> Whats on your toast?
[2:37:25] <%smoothwood07> put some beans on that toast, then we have something
[2:37:31] <%Forbidden_Karp> toast sandwich
[2:37:32] <+RyTYoung> Does Gief get the toast?
[2:37:33] <%TheWinged7> this is outrageous pat, you didnt bring enough for the whole chat psaBougie
[2:37:34] <%doc_ock_rokc> He can have a little toast
[2:37:36] <CatRidder> give toast to the gieff

[2:37:43] <NoWayRyanTatum> LUL
[2:37:44] <%CappuccinoGuil> guys, y'all wanna hear something spooky? Inside you... there's a skeleton... right now!
[2:37:44] <tanarath> needs butter & jam
[2:37:45] <%HaroldDonchee> toast is dinner if I eat an entire loaf
[2:37:46] <Sternieliscious> Put cinnamon on it to figure out why kids like it.
[2:37:48] <+RyTYoung> Gief should get toast
[2:37:48] <%DXLelouch24> you really are orb Shaggy
[2:37:51] <akitanito> I forgot toast sandwich is a thing
[2:37:53] <+ThomasOfTroy> So you're having an open=sided peanut butter sandwich
[2:37:58] <SaltyAzteca> Peanut butter on toast is fine
[2:38:05] <Dr_Bearington_The_Second> peanut butter toast slaps
[2:38:06] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> @DXLelouch24 You've never had a toasted PB&J? It's amazing.
[2:38:12] <%doc_ock_rokc> Is a loaf of bread just a bread sandwich?

[2:38:49] <%cobalt_phoenix_> is he wrong tho
[2:38:53] <%Treuan> where's the lie tho
[2:38:54] <%Logoth_> It's a brick of bread
[2:39:00] <tanarath> It IS, doc, bread sandwich exists
[2:39:01] <%SaiyanShoto> If you slice the ends then it is
[2:39:03] <+mczarklesby> Bread Sandwich is a specific depression era food. Toasted bread between untoasted bread, ketchup or mayo if you got it.
[2:39:07] <Sternieliscious> Russian sammich is just one slice. You'd put butter and caviar on that bad boy.
[2:39:09] <Dr_Bearington_The_Second> Wouldn't it be the other way around? @doc_ock_rokc
[2:39:17] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> @DXLelouch24 I shall accept this curse if it fails you, because I believe in the toasted PB&J.
[2:39:27] <%vivaldiva> is a loaf of bread a muffin or a cake?
[2:39:27] <NoWayRyanTatum> if you put two loaves of bread in between a slab of ham is it a sandwich?
[2:39:29] <%Reaped_Psyche> Anything is a sandwich if I can hold it in one hand easily while I gamble with the other.
[2:39:31] <ExpressNode> It's just a sandwich with bread between it
[2:39:37] <+ThomasOfTroy> @SaiyanShoto That sounds like one of those disgusting things that someone likes only because they had it as a treat when they were young, like a bread, ketchup, and hotdog "pizza"
[2:39:37] <%Cozy90> GARLIC BREAD OR CINNAMON TOAST

[2:49:20] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> Yeah...yeah...I see it....
[2:49:22] <%CappuccinoGuil> since enemies are dropping runes, I'm assuming you can sell gear?
[2:49:27] <%doc_ock_rokc> Nerd's been lifting BOOKS
[2:49:47] <tanarath> I think you should seek souls, many souls, powerful souls
[2:50:06] <%Reaped_Psyche> Bear Seek Seek Lest.
[2:50:08] <%doc_ock_rokc> Bare seek seek lest
[2:50:23] <+JonathLP> This game looks fun, but the text size is super small
[2:51:10] <%doc_ock_rokc> I want a game to have a haste spell where the person says "Bare seek seek lest" to cast it
[2:51:11] <+TopTieramisu> long cut
[2:51:23] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> How do you avoid that?
[2:51:59] <BettyMwwaahh> are those enemies backstepping through attacks? thats too advanced

[2:53:02] <%sandrews> They got a hatchet or spear?
[2:53:06] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @DashXero you think that's gonna stop him?
[2:53:16] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> As an Italian...I'm offended by this.
[2:53:19] <%TheHateFish> Wait, can you sell those things you've been picking up that have seemingly no use?
[2:53:28] <tanarath> Pat needs to farm the tutorial area
[2:53:40] <%DashXero> @cobalt_phoenix_ You have a point.
[2:53:49] <%CappuccinoGuil> See if you can't sell stuff for upgrades
[2:54:03] <%YakumoYomi> Oh no!

[2:55:29] <%NopeBadguy> YOU'VE BEEN EARLY ACCESSED
[2:55:33] <%HaroldDonchee> its the darude wall
[2:55:51] <%vivaldiva> it should launch you back into  the world like a motorcross game
[2:56:15] <Hyphen_Sum> the space should just loop

[2:58:36] <+ALazo> throwing for content
[2:58:50] <+thecowpow> tbf the only thing that kicked your ass there was gravity
[2:58:52] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> Pat is actually holding back to make the game seem more difficult.
[2:58:56] <+SuperFightinRobot> Speedrun strats
[2:58:57] <%CappuccinoGuil> Sure, Pat, we believe you
[2:58:58] <akitanito> it's fine to be blind pat

[2:59:15] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Totaslly
[2:59:23] <tanarath> It's all a bit.
[2:59:25] <@Ranryu692> it must be tiring, holding back every time you stream
[2:59:31] <fistynopunches> sand is dire
[2:59:33] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> Toastally.
[2:59:35] <%MugenSandan> Pat is an excellent person to have do a sponsored stream for your game #patstaresat #sponsored
[2:59:39] <%BlackStarAura> mmm spice
[2:59:54] <+thecowpow> half expecting you to run into Slave Knight Gael
[3:00:11] <%nipplestheenchilada96> nipplestheenchilada96 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 2 month streak! 
[3:00:12] <%doc_ock_rokc> Walk without rythum
[3:00:12] <NoWayRyanTatum> just gotta put all the sand back where it came from, just need a really big shovel
[3:00:15] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> It would be cool if a Terrormaw appeared.
[3:00:18] <%ThirdWelles> Haven't seen anything on th9is game but I like sand barges
[3:00:21] <+thecowpow> Hand over that thing. Your cool boat.
[3:00:22] <tanarath> Kinda like Dark Souls/Diablo
[3:00:27] <BettyMwwaahh> wheres the racing sections?

[3:02:31] <+OverzealousEuthanasiast> early access stork
[3:02:38] <+OverzealousEuthanasiast> storm not stork
[3:02:47] <+thecowpow> ship anchors acutally usually don't hit the bottom. It's just a weight to hold it down and the anchor effect is from the massive surface area of the chain
[3:03:03] <NoWayRyanTatum> oh it oes
[3:03:08] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt Angriest pat could do those islands
[3:03:19] <+thecowpow> I'm really enjoying Wind Waker Souls
[3:03:38] <fistynopunches> your dude had nothing to say
[3:03:54] <BettyMwwaahh> it seeems like this character has a huge head
[3:03:56] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> @thecowpow I watched a video about this once, and you're right about the chains, but I remember the video saying that the anchor does dig into the sea floor.
[3:04:03] <%nipplestheenchilada96> man simply not angry enough to escape death
[3:04:08] <NoWayRyanTatum> HAHAHA

[3:05:00] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> What is Leisis?

[3:08:37] <Rionxgarland> this temple reminds me of dusk
[3:08:53] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> Would VR completely trivialize RE 4?
[3:08:58] <%Reaped_Psyche> I kinda love her.
[3:09:33] <%Fooguwu> pat went to the skeleton graveyard first LUL

[3:18:03] <%CapnBeefs> Murder that Wendigo
[3:18:03] <%bevyrage> leg stick made out of rocks
[3:18:07] <%AncelDeLambert> ... did your brain just fail on the word "bone"?
[3:18:07] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> Admiral Bone-to-Pick
[3:18:11] <%bevyrage> bones become rocks, not are made from rocks pat
[3:18:11] <stevenellis386> well, you got a stick with large knife on it. Stick it too him!
[3:18:22] <MileenaTheOni> Peeeeeeeeach! Pat thinks skeletons are made of stiiiiiicks!
[3:18:23] <%BlackStarAura> heal
[3:18:29] <+cubbywolf> bonk
[3:18:32] <+thecowpow> wow hes eating your ass
[3:18:48] <+cubbywolf> he's using some foreign weapon
[3:18:58] <+cubbywolf> some rocky stick thing
[3:19:06] <stevenellis386> no heal bruh?
[3:19:17] <%CappuccinoGuil> That poison is doing work, damn[
[3:19:30] <NoWayRyanTatum> LUL
[3:19:33] <%CapnBeefs> A stick
[3:19:35] <+cubbywolf> it's hardened malk
[3:19:38] <%CappuccinoGuil> GREED
[3:19:40] <Visorak6> tragic
[3:19:40] <+thecowpow> bonk
[3:19:43] <%doc_ock_rokc> so close
[3:19:44] <%Mekhet09> Well you were close.
[3:19:44] <+cubbywolf> F
[3:19:47] <tanarath> Close!
[3:19:52] <+cubbywolf> you love to see it
[3:19:56] <%CapnBeefs> Press F for Fail
[3:20:00] <+NoriBasket> it's a skeleton that has somehow armored itself in flesh, what a twisted monster
[3:20:01] <akitanito> true
[3:20:02] <%CappuccinoGuil> Can you upgrade armor?
[3:20:06] <%nipplestheenchilada96> ah, the ole milk stick. a classic
[3:20:22] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> Pat intended to lose, he just wanted people to buy the game themselves to see what happens when you beat a boss.
[3:20:29] <%CapnBeefs> Two could be a big number
[3:20:29] <%ThirdWelles> So like 12%?
[3:20:31] <akitanito> 2 is more than 10% tho
[3:20:36] <+cubbywolf> I once fell off a cliff and was attacked by a skeleton. came right out of the ground through my leg
[3:20:44] <%CappuccinoGuil> Maybe it's small because it's cumulative? Like, 2 on 3 pieces of armor is a lot
[3:20:54] <+NoriBasket> did you live? @cubbywolf
[3:21:04] <+cubbywolf> nah I died
[3:21:10] <%ThirdWelles> True. Just don't get hit
[3:21:19] <%TheHateFish> What's your max HP, Pat?
[3:21:29] <+cubbywolf> my broken bones stay inside my like a good skeleton should
[3:21:40] <akitanito> not enough
[3:21:51] <+cubbywolf> is there an estus flask like mechanic?
[3:21:56] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> @cubbywolf You won't be able to contain it forever.
[3:21:58] <%CappuccinoGuil> But you have 4 pieces of armor, right? So it makes sense defense upgrade is small.
[3:22:01] <%TheHateFish> Ah, it's 70
[3:22:14] <akitanito> WHY
[3:22:17] <%CapnBeefs> BOOOOO
[3:22:17] <+cubbywolf> I will die trying
[3:22:18] <%doc_ock_rokc> RIP
[3:22:19] <+xerotwo> LUL
[3:22:21] <%afronooch> LUL
[3:22:24] <%Piemono> how embarassing
[3:22:24] <+cubbywolf> kinda like that
[3:22:25] <palruda> There is a skill tree somewhere and you spend scrolls there
[3:22:40] <+cubbywolf> LUL
[3:22:50] <%CappuccinoGuil> IS THAT TRUE?!
[3:22:53] <%BlackStarAura> lol
[3:22:53] <@Ranryu692> is that why everything is kicking your ass?
[3:22:54] <tanarath> Also, you can Parry
[3:22:59] <akitanito> OH NOOOOOOOOOO
[3:23:03] <+NoriBasket> You should find that Tree and CUT IT DOWN
[3:23:06] <palruda> Saw it on another stream
[3:23:09] <%Mekhet09> check your codex?
[3:23:11] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> No tree for you
[3:23:13] <+cubbywolf> LUL
[3:23:14] <%CappuccinoGuil> WAIT, I THOUGHT YOU LOST YOUR BLOCK
[3:23:17] <akitanito> so pat was doing a no skill run
[3:23:21] <%CappuccinoGuil> He had the block THIS WHOLE TIME
[3:23:23] <Psyramics> is Pat that journo that did all of Mass Effect without putting points in a single skill?
[3:23:28] <%Mekhet09> go into your item.
[3:23:44] <+Aikao> monkaS
[3:23:51] <+cubbywolf> time stop power for the pasta rat
[3:24:01] <%Mekhet09> codex.
[3:24:24] <%TheHateFish> @Mekhet09 He used the Codex
[3:24:32] <%Mekhet09> Oh did he.
[3:24:35] <+Aikao> Oh, wrong game. Kappa
[3:24:36] <%Treuan> nothin what's a codex with you?
[3:24:37] <+Dakuu75> chat, are you trying to backseat for a game you've never seen before?
[3:24:44] <+cubbywolf> LUL
[3:25:02] <+NoriBasket> we must find the priest
[3:25:03] <%ThirdWelles> This is like that time chat lied about how to do a thing in Dread
[3:25:11] <+NoriBasket> so we can cut down the skill tree
[3:25:26] <%CappuccinoGuil> did she mean the cinderhold?
[3:25:27] <%joodatious> @PatStaresAt just wanted to tell you that you might wanna check out Baldurs Gate 3 again, its gotten a massive update and from personal experience runs WAY better along with having a big content drop
[3:25:28] <+cubbywolf> chat never lies just one guy tricks everyone
[3:25:34] <%ThirdWelles> Proposal: if you haven't played a game, consider playing the game
[3:25:47] <%ThirdWelles> THEN whining in chat
[3:26:00] <+cubbywolf> nah
[3:26:05] <+Aikao> But I just want to whine BabyRage
[3:26:09] <+NoriBasket> good feedback for the devs is to increase the fast travel range
[3:26:10] <+cubbywolf> i like to pretend I know stuff
[3:26:16] <%GuilKato> i can't beleive it
[3:26:35] <+cubbywolf> sailing on sand reminds me of breath of fire
[3:26:37] <%MelBrooksKA> Whining at Pat is very soothing
[3:26:57] <%SveriSageAdvice> good Spongebob reference btw lol
[3:26:57] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[3:27:01] <%Piemono> The only thing i can find about a skill tree is an article mentioning that they're called blessings
[3:27:02] <%ThirdWelles> I like whining with expertise
[3:27:11] <%Forbidden_Karp> all zombie mobs now
[3:27:26] <+NoriBasket> I bet their skull crypt doesn't have a Flesh Knight in it
[3:27:29] <%JoshManVGH> Weeast by Snorth Eest.
[3:27:47] <%ThirdWelles> I like the "recently annihilated town" area in games

[3:28:04] <%MelBrooksKA> Would you call it a blighted town?
[3:28:08] <%CappuccinoGuil> Really wish the money did the souls thing where it shows how much you're getting on the pick up
[3:28:08] <akitanito> they were human beings
[3:28:08] <+cubbywolf> spooky bros
[3:28:14] <%ThirdWelles> what is a human being, if not a meat skeleton?
[3:28:19] <+NoriBasket> skeletons are just human beings on a diet
[3:28:21] <+cubbywolf> haha you almost died
[3:28:30] <%doc_ock_rokc> Did he just POCKET SAND YOU
[3:28:38] <+cubbywolf> that hit hurt
[3:28:40] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> Skeletons are just human beings in their true form.

[3:29:19] <%xbb1024> plop
[3:29:19] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> @PatStaresAt Do you think you'll beat one boss tonight?
[3:29:36] <%ThirdWelles> what about half a boss?
[3:29:38] <%Forbidden_Karp> you beat tutorial boss
[3:29:40] <%doc_ock_rokc> get golum
[3:29:44] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> Not a very confident maybe.
[3:29:50] <%Treuan> heck yeah
[3:29:55] <+NoriBasket> it's true
[3:29:56] <+Dakuu75> Box, checked.
[3:30:08] <%shootbang_exe> not sure if I missed it but how early access/how cclose to done is this game?
[3:30:29] <+cubbywolf> scouts rely on their honor
[3:30:29] <+SuperFightinRobot> Contact damage is rarely good
[3:30:34] <+NoriBasket> are you OK pastaPat?
[3:30:40] <+thecowpow> It's a Wonderful Stream
[3:30:42] <%ThirdWelles> I mean the accent was pretty good
[3:30:47] <%JoshManVGH> Christmas?
[3:30:51] <+cubbywolf> pasta rat streams are fun
[3:30:58] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> @shootbang_exe Somewhere in between unfinished and ready for release.
[3:30:59] <%MelBrooksKA> Guys, we broke Pat
[3:31:03] <MileenaTheOni> JokesForNobodyDotWav
[3:31:15] <+NoriBasket> that accent was pretty good
[3:31:21] <%justcallmebobplease> Enthusiasm and mockery and gesticulation is honestly enough!
[3:31:22] <KnivesEve> but that is italian
[3:31:22] <%Gamblitz> pat is a pro at the pathetic voice
[3:31:22] <%SaiyanShoto> That's the best italian accent
[3:31:24] <@Ranryu692> that's an i-talian accent
[3:31:27] <%justcallmebobplease> Just go hard enough, it's fiiiiine
[3:31:28] <Psyramics> babada bobadi!
[3:31:31] <+cubbywolf> sounded authentic to me fellow canadian
[3:31:34] <+Dakuu75> that is a very sparkly attack
[3:31:34] <Psyramics> i make-a the pizza!
[3:31:36] <%notsoy> haven't you watched a bunch of mobster movies?
[3:31:39] <+Dotta5> Just do Jersey, close enough
[3:31:47] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> Badda Bing, Badda Boom!
[3:31:57] <+cubbywolf> I say spahgoots instead of spaghetti
[3:32:01] <%ThirdWelles> Man, them fuckers's FAST
[3:32:03] <@Ranryu692> also, when has one of your accents being bad ever stopped you before?
[3:32:09] <+NoriBasket> but you're more powerful than you've ever been
[3:32:21] <+cubbywolf> borf
[3:32:23] <%JoshManVGH> What about a Brooklyn Italian accent? Like a Joe Pesci?
[3:32:24] <%ThirdWelles> Good swing
[3:32:36] <%GuilKato> Zangief is throwing a party!
[3:32:38] <+Dakuu75> AWAY, AWAY~
[3:32:47] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> You just gotta make vowel noises will moving your hands, pretty much all I do.
[3:32:52] <+cubbywolf> that thunder seems kinda cheep
[3:32:56] <%Gamblitz> I am Borf son of Dogh
[3:33:04] <+NoriBasket> parry seems strong
[3:33:23] <akitanito> that's probably make the game a lot easier now
[3:33:36] <%Treuan> YEH
[3:33:37] <+NoriBasket> was this game actually easy the whole time
[3:33:39] <akitanito> so much easier
[3:33:41] <%CappuccinoGuil> Just needed to block!

[3:35:43] <%Gamblitz> ladder without a light source Gaben not happy
[3:35:57] <+NoriBasket> fancy clothes
[3:36:08] <%Forbidden_Karp> don't think so
[3:36:19] <+cubbywolf> do optional bosses count as real bosses?
[3:36:28] <Ides42> is there no sort by item slot type of thing?
[3:36:42] <+cubbywolf> LUL
[3:37:11] <+NoriBasket> this seems a bad idea...

[3:40:37] <akitanito> it never happened
[3:40:47] <SaltyAzteca> AND THE CHILDREN TOO!
[3:40:51] <%doc_ock_rokc> Is this like that one gun game? where you go into the multiverse>
[3:41:02] <%CappuccinoGuil> Now with the power of BLOCK
[3:41:11] <%Mekhet09> You mean revenant.
[3:41:17] <+cubbywolf> bow and stern stern and bow
[3:41:20] <%HaroldDonchee> a bet testing was fun for this
[3:41:26] <NeroInfinite> can you flip the boat?
[3:41:44] <+cubbywolf> boop the rock
[3:41:52] <+NoriBasket> are there gargoyles at the Belfry
[3:41:52] <%Gamblitz> Sand of bandits
[3:42:00] <AbnormalVoid> the poison for kuzco
[3:42:05] <%CappuccinoGuil> And you have BLOCK
[3:42:25] <+cubbywolf> anti gravity land
[3:43:00] <%Mekhet09> Stairs.
[3:43:09] <+NoriBasket> parry
[3:43:27] <+cubbywolf> these som e big ass ladders
[3:43:42] <DusK_The_Stray> Wow, that sounds a little like the intro to I like Big Butts and I cannot Lie
[3:43:55] <stevenellis386> YIKES
[3:43:58] <+NoriBasket> you almost had one down
[3:44:01] <%CappuccinoGuil> Tupi's place?
[3:44:07] <%CappuccinoGuil> oh gotcha
[3:44:13] <+cubbywolf> brute force it
[3:44:31] <%Dova573> He kept Paldin shockwaving
[3:44:34] <tanarath> Pat, grab your souls
[3:44:43] <+cubbywolf> this seems even harder
[3:45:21] <+cubbywolf> not that I know having never played
[3:45:28] <+cubbywolf> but I like to ptetend
[3:45:37] <+NoriBasket> you place them on top of your armor
[3:45:38] <%ThirdWelles> click on it then click a piece of armor
[3:45:42] <+NoriBasket> on the left
[3:45:43] <%ThirdWelles> Isn't that what we just saw?
[3:45:58] <+Dotta5> Shelve the runes
[3:46:05] <%CappuccinoGuil> it looked like you could click it and choose the armor?
[3:46:06] <%ThirdWelles> When you clicked on a rune it highlighted your pieces of armor in your inventory
[3:46:06] <+cubbywolf> LUL
[3:46:17] <%ThirdWelles> As though you could just slot them there and then
[3:46:22] <%CappuccinoGuil> Or can you not move to the armor once you select the runes?
[3:46:34] <BettyMwwaahh> in FF14, is there a camera mode like Gpose but for yourself?
[3:46:43] <+cubbywolf> that's the best time
[3:46:49] <SForlord> Alec Baldwin accidentally killed a cinematographer
[3:47:07] <+Dakuu75> this game looks like it's trying to be a Hades/ Souls hybrid but, it's so slow paced
[3:47:10] <+cubbywolf> LUL
[3:47:17] <%ThirdWelles> So do you not have any runes slotted at all?
[3:47:44] <+cubbywolf> for a place with a lot of skeletons that's a pretty bloody fountain
[3:47:47] <%ThirdWelles> You can do that now though
[3:47:52] <%ThirdWelles> It looked like at least
[3:48:06] <%ThirdWelles> Click on then click a piece of armor
[3:48:16] <%ThirdWelles> See your glowing armor pieces in your inventory?
[3:48:42] <+Dakuu75> he knows. his point is, it's so insignificant, it doesn't matter
[3:48:51] <%ThirdWelles> I mean it's terrible stat, but it's still stat
[3:49:13] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> So has Pat found out that the real Sands of Aura were the friends we made along the way?
[3:49:54] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> @PatStaresAt Do you think you'd play this game again when it fully releases?
[3:50:16] <%Piemono> could he talk to that dead body?
[3:50:37] <%CappuccinoGuil> @Piemono yes, but he did already
[3:50:45] <%Piemono> okay
[3:50:57] <+NoriBasket> I'm keen for Nov19th
[3:51:21] <%ThirdWelles> LMAO
[3:51:30] <%ThirdWelles> It's *our* birthday
[3:51:39] <%doc_ock_rokc> Pat turns 80 this year
[3:51:40] <%SovPho> @PatStaresAt you thinking about giving back 4 blood a stream?
[3:51:42] <+NoriBasket> Full Access is literally on my Birthday
[3:51:48] <+NoriBasket> but who waits for full access
[3:51:57] <tanarath> Is a loot toggle like in Diablo in the works?
[3:52:25] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> Short, blonde and an alchemist. This is clearly Edward Elric.
[3:52:30] <AbnormalVoid> the poison specifically made for kuzco
[3:52:39] <stevenellis386> cmon pat you can beat this punk
[3:52:43] <%doc_ock_rokc> But pat if you poison your enemies you can't  canablize the meat
[3:52:50] <%SovPho> also look at this fuckin Unreal game
[3:52:52] <Ozavic> So phase 2 is big yeah?
[3:53:22] <%JoshManVGH> Two dooooooooooooown... spoof
[3:53:24] <%DXLelouch24> did the boss just jump off the roof?

[3:55:39] <+thecowpow> very unsafe elevator
[3:55:49] <+NoriBasket> there's nothing like a nice big treasure chest
[3:55:52] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> 2 down, how many to go?
[3:56:16] <%Taisuru> Blasting ass gives gief power
[3:56:17] <%notsoy> YOU HEARD THE BONG IT'S TEA TIME MATE INNIT

[3:56:58] <tanarath> rip
[3:57:01] <akitanito> has gief access the speedforce yet
[3:57:05] <%HaroldDonchee> momentum. hes like the juggernaut
[3:57:05] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> Bulldogs are pure muscle if taken care of right.
[3:57:08] <%BlackStarAura> psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp
[3:57:09] <+Dakuu75> Zangief has EX moves
[3:57:09] <+NoriBasket> Bullet Bill Doggo
[3:57:23] <akitanito> not gief?
[3:57:29] <+Dakuu75> again?
[3:57:36] <@Ranryu692> just like how you broke her stream earlier
[3:57:39] <tanarath> Ultra Instinct Zangief
[3:57:47] <+PMAvers> So what you’re saying is that Gief is a.. [Big Shot]?
[3:57:48] <thewrathofscience> Zangief wavedash?
[3:58:18] <%shurtal> does gief have [hyperlink block] ?
[3:58:22] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> Ubaani is so far my favorite design.
[3:58:36] <palruda> The skills are called blessings bought at a church
[3:58:49] <%KishinGrek> !UPTIME
[3:58:50] <@Moobot> @KishinGrek I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 58m.
[3:58:58] <tanarath> Do the parry!
[3:59:10] <%Taisuru> You should go the right way next time
[3:59:12] <%ThirdWelles> have you considered going the right way?
[3:59:20] <thewrathofscience> Gief is trying to find enough space to shinespark
[3:59:59] <%NopeBadguy> he's going to shinespark through the damn monitor
[4:00:05] <+Dotta5> external bursts? thems farts
[4:00:20] <%KishinGrek> so how long will the Early Access version let you go?
[4:00:21] <%bevyrage> just wait until gief realizes he can get more momentum to shinespark if he wall jumps
[4:00:26] <+SuperFightinRobot> Oh god, gief with a shinespark would mean the end of this stream. Possibly all of Montreal.
[4:00:41] <+NoriBasket> can you parry his Shenanigans?
[4:00:43] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> Do you have I frames on dodge?
[4:00:47] <akitanito> gief ball spark
[4:00:48] <%ThirdWelles> I don't wanna think about "external bursts" when talking about Gief
[4:01:13] <akitanito> do those pillars have health or is it just based on the number of hits?
[4:01:15] <%doc_ock_rokc> IT IS A ROCK
[4:01:40] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> Music go up.
[4:01:58] <+NoriBasket> parry the world, Patrick
[4:02:07] <akitanito> why'd you crazy talk yourself
[4:02:12] <+SuperFightinRobot> That whip attack is nuts
[4:02:13] <%doc_ock_rokc> Leisi doesn't want you
[4:02:15] <%TheHateFish> Remember your block/parry
[4:02:17] <+Dotta5> zoom harder
[4:02:22] <%doc_ock_rokc> STOP TRYING TO SEND YOURSELF TO HER
[4:02:23] <CurrySauseBandit> This kinda reminds me of a PSO2 fight.
[4:02:28] <akitanito> just his shit
[4:02:31] <%Taisuru> We believe in you Zangief's Dad
[4:02:32] <akitanito> *hug his shit

[4:03:04] <%KishinGrek> just like Boruto's dad
[4:03:05] <+Basker17> Its better than being known as the "sus guy" lol
[4:03:06] <CurrySauseBandit> Zangief's dad, Paige's orb. It begins.
[4:03:21] <%cade_calrayn> you're Zangief Dad and PaigeWife
[4:03:25] <tanarath> >become
[4:03:26] <%ThirdWelles> Everyone else's joke but highlighted
[4:03:27] <%JoshManVGH> It's The Adventures Giefdad and Elmom
[4:03:30] <%doc_ock_rokc> Did Zangief's dad used to have some long lost brother or something?
[4:03:35] <+thickshield> the balls of this man, to assume he could be more popular than gief... let alone ANY dog

[4:05:35] <thesugardaddy111> did Alec Baldwin shoot a lady? is that real?
[4:05:44] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> Yes.
[4:05:51] <akitanito> prop gun gone wrong
[4:05:57] <%CappuccinoGuil> yup
[4:06:03] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> So he Brandon Lee'd somebody?
[4:06:04] <@PeachSaliva> @thesugardaddy111 yes but let’s not bring that up right now
[4:06:09] <$cewoldt426> Yeah he shot and killed a lady and injured the director
[4:06:09] <%Cruven_gladomain> Seems to possibly be another Brandon Lee situation.
[4:06:23] <%ThirdWelles> You're doing the patented PeachSaliva Early-roll
[4:06:28] <@PeachSaliva> Nobody likes hearing news this way live on stream.
[4:06:35] <akitanito> pasta dad more interesting
[4:06:50] <%KishinGrek> @nigelschnauzerpug there were SO Many other options, you really went with Brandon Lee?
[4:06:51] <$cewoldt426> Whoops sorry fellas
[4:07:02] <@PeachSaliva> @cewoldt426 that’s okay, I appreciate you!!
[4:07:05] <%CappuccinoGuil> I'm guessing Pat's estus is hidden behind his cam? Like, how does he know how many he has left?
[4:07:09] <+NoriBasket> hi paige
[4:07:18] <@PeachSaliva> @noribasket howdy do :3
[4:07:26] <%Gamblitz> Rule of Acquisition 17: a Contract is a Contract is a Contract.... but only between Ferengi
[4:07:29] <Psyramics> this feels like you're using the wrong weapon type, but i dunno if thats a thing
[4:07:48] <%Forbidden_Karp> big challenge
[4:07:50] <akitanito> does weapon type matter?
[4:07:53] <@PeachSaliva> @gamblitz I really wanna a copy of the rules of acquisition
[4:08:07] <Psyramics> I mean mor elike blunt vs slashing
[4:08:18] <+NoriBasket> I feel like Pat is pressing the right buttons but just slightly at the wrong times
[4:08:24] <thesugardaddy111> yeah like hammer or something
[4:08:31] <@PeachSaliva> @noribasket that’s because he is not as cool as me who did a good job

[4:09:44] <+NoriBasket> Can you parry the UnderGround Fist?
[4:09:49] <akitanito> that whip attack doesn't seem to hurt if you are right next to it
[4:09:50] <+NoriBasket> seems easier than dodging
[4:09:54] <ytwitchmeng> Can someone type in brail?
[4:09:58] <%doc_ock_rokc> STOP SENDING YOURSEL FTO LESIS THEY DO NO WANT YOU
[4:09:59] <%KishinGrek> @gamblitz PatSaliva
[4:10:17] <%CappuccinoGuil> I feel like you need to figure that stuff out, what can and can't be parried
[4:10:20] <+NoriBasket> we all return to Leslie when we die
[4:10:25] <tanarath> You're getting it, Pat
[4:11:11] <%doc_ock_rokc> It wasn't just a rock....It was a ROCK MONSTER

[4:12:39] <%KishinGrek> that's what I get for putting my faith in you
[4:12:50] <thesugardaddy111> that was definitely not a bad attempt
[4:12:56] <rosysyntax> wowww
[4:13:11] <Dr_Bearington_The_Second> 100% is still a percent
[4:13:14] <%CappuccinoGuil> Literal game changer
[4:13:39] <tanarath> That IS an important thing
[4:13:41] <oniwahoo> 100% is quite literally a percent
[4:14:00] <%Gamblitz> Man that thing makes the same Moan you here on the Surface in the First two Metro Games
[4:14:02] <thesugardaddy111> u just have to got past 100%
[4:14:09] <%KishinGrek> in fact it's ALL the percent
[4:14:13] <%Gamblitz> *you hear
[4:14:17] <+SuperFightinRobot> I mean 100% is a percent, but pedantry is a terrible argument.
[4:14:54] <+RyTYoung> I shall now spend 0% of my time here then gigaboOtsBani2
[4:15:04] <oniwahoo> lol
[4:15:07] <%KishinGrek> you gotta think like Senku, it's 1 billion %
[4:15:21] <%Gamblitz> 100% isn't a percent, its a Boolean
[4:15:46] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> 2 part stream?

[4:17:13] <%KishinGrek> put in 'Pat Mode' in the final version
[4:17:18] <tanarath> Pat, I think with a fresh try, you'd do a lot better.
[4:17:26] <%DashXero> It'll be the best thing you've ever done.
[4:17:28] <%linSP> hey pat just tried inscryption and i beat the boss on my second run, this game is nuts

[4:19:25] <%afronooch> psaWrong
[4:19:26] <oniwahoo> Horrifying
[4:19:29] <%KishinGrek> you disgust me
[4:19:31] <@Ranryu692> the worst part of that sentence was "long apple"
[4:19:32] <thesugardaddy111> wtf why?
[4:19:32] <%ThirdWelles> Because that shit was fucking wild to read
[4:19:33] <%AncelDeLambert> that's just gonna make it so you have two burritos
[4:19:34] <Psyramics> you dont eat burritoes like their corn on the cob?
[4:19:35] <oniwahoo> Why would you do this?!
[4:19:38] <%Ynkubus_> Powerful

[4:21:19] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> @StromkoPenguin Yes
[4:21:28] <%Ynkubus_> @twistedj3ster MKUltra? it turned out to be a way to generate and weaponise trauma essentially
[4:21:39] <oniwahoo> Sensory deprivation sounds like it would be great for getting some sleep tho
[4:21:40] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> @StromkoPenguin Eventually they stopped making noises on the higher levels, even saying they had heart conditions.
