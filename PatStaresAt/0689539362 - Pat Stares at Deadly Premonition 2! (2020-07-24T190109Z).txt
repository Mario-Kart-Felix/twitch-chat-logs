[0:07:45] <BlkFlameKami> mistakes into miracles
[0:07:46] <%weissguard> Patti is the best character.
[0:07:47] <%Spiderfacev> remember the folgers incest commercial?
[0:07:49] <%ringabal> For once, the incest child's defect is her being super smart.
[0:07:51] <Kuj999> Maybe
[0:07:52] <saltyvest> Is it just atarting or ending?
[0:07:53] <+JeluxDaCasual> Incest is best cest, lol?

[0:56:38] <%cvp5127> did you eat it?
[0:56:40] <@SoFarFetched> and he ate the pizza off the floor,cause Simon doesn't wanna waste pizza.
[0:56:44] <%Jumpie8> gross
[0:56:47] <nomolomo> the pizza probably had worms
[0:56:47] <%twistedj3ster> do you see it? The FK made of pepperoni?
[0:56:50] <mikitty> Simon
[0:56:50] <+NitronStreams> CLAM CHOWDAH
[0:56:50] <%GarbageQueenEllie> A red box. Maybe that's a clue
[0:56:51] <nomolomo> thats why you always gotta check
[0:56:54] <+Deekman> i wanna see that gif of walter white throwing his pizza on the roof with Zach
[0:56:56] <PastaL> Pat, please change shirts, you're freaking Zach out.
[0:56:56] <dukenux> Walter White pizza throw reference
[0:56:57] <+ALazo> Simon ate it off the floor after that
[0:56:59] <Gallhint> just got in, have I missed anything cool?
[0:57:00] <penitentpentwitch> At this point I hope Simon becomes a giant pizza boss monster
[0:57:07] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Oh my GOD. That's it. It's REDBOX THEATRE
[0:57:08] <mikitty> I would have thought so too, something must have happened then
[0:57:09] <%kyh9> No, he's had it forever but he didn't notice the box
[0:57:11] <%JVolfram> To be fair Chicago style pizza is ass
[0:57:12] <$dalmek> it might've gone from "kinda uncomfortable with red" to actual phobia only recently
[0:57:13] <wannabemoogle> Maybe it wasn't as triggering as it is now?
[0:57:14] <%clockworknate> Im surprised simon hasnt shot him already
[0:57:14] <brachydios777> Or maybe because Chicago pizza is not pizza
[0:57:18] <Sartastic> JUST DIE
[0:57:21] <%Captain_Doomsday> So he's not afraid of the red SEEDS, he's afraid of the Red Room
[0:57:25] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> Simon's stand lets him control all things pizza

[1:40:37] <+Sutokingu> there are asset flips that run better than this holy shit
[1:40:39] <saltyvest> Zach, public opinion on us is divisive, yes, but respectful in full. That's the deep south for you, Zach.
[1:40:39] <BallerSwagBro9k> @boomstickery HOW DO U KNOW THAT SIR?
[1:40:40] <%erohoney> that update really fixed it. it's as smooth as coffee now, Zach
[1:40:46] <MattoBii> they absolutely do
[1:40:53] <%GabeSweetMan> That entire rotation had 60 frames. Not per second, just in total.

[1:41:16] <Tha_Mik> Get that guy
[1:41:18] <heartlesshealer> If you get sick, focus on York during high speed camera movement and take in the rest of the screen as background info. Like when you stare at a minimap to navigate Zeldo or something
[1:41:21] <%mike2hands> woolieONEGUY woolieONEGUY

[1:41:22] <saltyvest> ONE GUY LUL
[1:41:23] <%bread_assassin> psa1guy psa1guy
[1:41:29] <BaslerJones> So did DP1 confirm that York as DID or something ? I don't remember
[1:41:32] <%ringabal> Pat must now rustle the bayou gators
[1:41:33] <+xeros720> zeldo?
[1:41:33] <+pynkdoe> @DedlokPM nice PogChamp
[1:41:34] <%machshop> fuck seee
[1:41:37] <Joustar_> I bet the game would run way smoother if they just disabled the tree physics and added static lighting.
[1:41:47] <PastaL> Laura Kate Dale was very critical of this game, but it seems kind of okay how Lena is portrayed, i dunno.
[1:41:50] <nukle0nik> did you install the patch pat?
[1:41:53] <%DappercatEsquire> It's a shame they made a pretty neat gun loadout system with a decent amount of depth, but the shooting sections are minimal, and kinda boring
[1:41:56] <@SoFarFetched> patch already installed.
[1:41:58] <+krispen_wa> @BaslerJones I weird magical metaphysical type of DID
[1:41:59] <nukle0nik> sweet
[1:42:04] <saltyvest> Zach taking up too much processing power LUL
[1:42:08] <MrPedrovsky> @baslerjones child trauma coping mechanism zach/york switching places etc
[1:42:10] <$LuchaDePucha> did the patch do anything
[1:42:10] <$autcetera> @baslerjones I don't feel comfortable spoiling the first game here, but suffice it to say Zach is very real
[1:42:11] <%king_wragles> The patch was more for some dialog iirc
[1:42:17] <%joylent_blue> here comes the almost crash
[1:42:20] <%joylent_blue> there it is
[1:42:23] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @PastaL I think so. But that kind of topic is like walking on eggshells for some folks
[1:42:24] <MattoBii> patch only made minor improvements to FPS, but more patches are coming
[1:42:24] <%Th3SmartAlec> I believe in you loading screen
[1:42:26] <%joylent_blue> almost there
[1:42:27] <nukle0nik> it was supposed to also help with the framerate a bit... but not a lot
[1:42:28] <Joustar_> Patch notes: Our loading screen runs 15% smoother
[1:42:30] <AFlyingTaco1> @baslerjones Not exactly. Zach just awakened in York near the end of the game.
[1:42:33] <BaslerJones> yeah I know Zach is real and so is York
[1:42:35] <mattdel92> Zach is the realist SOB
[1:42:36] <dinnydanny777> Zack is from Gongaga
[1:42:36] <%joylent_blue> there we go
[1:42:39] <%SirGO0SE> Loadtime-chan! Ganbate!
[1:42:41] <dinnydanny777> Gongaga
[1:42:46] <+jiggy_snipe> go DP1
[1:42:46] <+Deekman> That's a personal matter
[1:42:47] <%arancet> well, youre playing as aaliyah
[1:42:48] <%tigerfang86> Just use your logic guys
[1:42:49] <cureneckbeard> you did it.
[1:42:50] <Frostydough1> everyone clap for load time he did it
[1:42:50] <%GabeSweetMan> WATCH THE LP DAMMIT
[1:42:51] <%tigerfang86> logic it up
[1:42:51] <%Wrashis> maybe play dp1
[1:42:53] <+pynkdoe> just play dp1
[1:42:54] <Darren716> Watch the first DP lp nerds
[1:42:55] <nukle0nik> watch the DP1 LP to be slightly less confused
[1:42:55] <+burgahb> Jesus christ this is bad
[1:42:55] <%SirGO0SE> me? gongaga
[1:42:55] <Kejang> play the first game
[1:42:56] <%joylent_blue> it's ok to be confused :)
[1:42:58] <%DappercatEsquire> "That's fine," end statement
[1:42:59] <heartlesshealer> playing as the lady actually, but yeah
[1:43:01] <AFlyingTaco1> Just go watch the entirety of the Best Friends Deadly Premonition LP
[1:43:02] <+pynkdoe> or watch the end of it i guess
[1:43:04] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Zach is York's Stand
[1:43:08] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah just some people in here jumped into watching this and not playing/watching the first game.
[1:43:08] <%Kyoshikei> watch the dp1 LP
[1:43:08] <+bizzer10> i dont get it. but im just going with it
[1:43:09] <%bhp_99> play the first DP
[1:43:09] <psimon_> srsly? I just thought Zach was nuts
[1:43:10] <dinnydanny777> Spend like 40 hours watching the LP lmao
[1:43:12] <%ringabal> Two words: Morphogenetic Field
[1:43:12] <quantras6> Oh sweet Christ this framerate is so disgusting
[1:43:13] <$autcetera> @pastal LKD has had some blistering takes in the past so I don't pay much attention to her. I think Lena's treatment is largely interesting and fair, but the particulars of gendering correctly and other things in English weren't done perfectly
[1:43:15] <MrPedrovsky> @patstaresat Remember there is a WAY longer Black screen before upcoming cutscene. It is around 7 minutes IIRC
[1:43:16] <ultimate_joker_main> @Joustar_ that's the same person who claimed the persona 5 OP song had the word "retarded" in it so i don't trust them
[1:43:16] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> yeah, i think it'd be a disservice to play DP2 before DP1
[1:43:16] <nukle0nik> this is a prequel
[1:43:19] <heartlesshealer> wow twitch itself just dying. time to refresh page
[1:43:20] <Frostydough1> is that real fcuking in game music
[1:43:24] <+Grayhammatter> holy crap, we zooming
[1:43:25] <%DedlokPM> @PastaL that was also before SWERY rewrote it, which has been already implemented text wise but with no audio
[1:43:29] <missingangle> I couldn't be relaxed with this framerate. I'd be in a constant state of anxiety
[1:43:32] <dinnydanny777> 7 minutes loads holy shit
[1:43:32] <BlackDae> Zack is the user
[1:43:33] <+krispen_wa> People watching this without DP1 is like watching MGS2 without MGS1
[1:43:36] <%joylent_blue> what beautiful duwang, Zach
[1:43:37] <dinnydanny777> The future is now
[1:43:37] <MattoBii> this is both a prequel AND a sequel
[1:43:40] <Tucker0603> this is both a prequel and a sequel
[1:43:42] <Tha_Mik> Get that ufo
[1:43:44] <+Deekman> Deadly Premonition 1 is currently $14 USD on the eshop. Go buy it
[1:43:46] <%SirGO0SE> TONGO
[1:43:47] <%Nobrev> Nobrev subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 27 months! more prime money for goblin prime
[1:43:52] <brachydios777> Patched btw
[1:43:54] <%GabeSweetMan> Deadly Premonition is not a game I can recommend for *playing* because it is a fucked game for crazy people. Meanwhile watching it is still a trip and a half.
[1:43:54] <+jiggy_snipe> damn these oofoes
[1:43:56] <+OK__Gamer> UFO biding in the frames
[1:43:58] <$dalmek> look at that buttery smooth gameplay

[1:44:01] <%ringabal> SUB 10 FRAMES PERFECT

[1:44:02] <nukle0nik> nice sun
[1:44:03] <BaslerJones> I think I will just buy a switch for this game
[1:44:08] <PastaL> I see, thanks, folks
[1:44:08] <noyman2000> Whoa there
[1:44:10] <nukle0nik> to the right a bit

[1:44:11] <%DedlokPM> SHOOT DA SUN rooVV
[1:44:12] <%GarbageQueenEllie> I thought in terms of Japanese cultural translation, Lena's portrayal was pretty tame compared to other stuff
[1:44:12] <%Grimlockfly> kill the sun
[1:44:14] <%joylent_blue> York don't look directly at the sun NotLikeThis
[1:44:15] <+Deekman> i played this game for HOURS and never got a tan or sunburn
[1:44:16] <%Grimlockfly> it know what it did
[1:44:18] <quantras6> small family company please understand
[1:44:22] <MrPedrovsky> @rolandknight a WHOPPING 2 Frames LoL
[1:44:22] <+krispen_wa> ATTACK AND DETHRONE THE SUN
[1:44:23] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> shoot the sun to get fire arrows, york
[1:44:25] <+pynkdoe> i wonder if it being a prequel threw some people off into thinking they should play this one first?
[1:44:26] <missingangle> You gotta play DP with friends or at least on stream with Pat. The craziness and absurdity is best shared
[1:44:27] <%Piemen99> ATTACK AND DETHRONE THE SUN
[1:44:28] <TrashbagZombie> Shoot Apollo right outta the sky
[1:44:37] <Ultimatefool> Wait, was the sunshine in the sky just pixelated LUL
[1:44:40] <BallerSwagBro9k> YEYEYEYEYEEYEYY
[1:44:40] <cureneckbeard> who is putting items attached to balloons in this town
[1:44:44] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah this game is both a prequel and sequel
[1:44:44] <%Th3SmartAlec> hate when that happens
[1:44:45] <Joustar_> @ultimate_joker_main I'm very confused right now. I didn't answer anything to one guy
[1:44:48] <%joylent_blue> ONE MORE SUN REJECTED
[1:44:50] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> shoot the framerate
[1:44:55] <%ToneBacas> so what's the latest on Patti and her name?

[1:45:02] <ultimate_joker_main> @Joustar_ what
[1:45:07] <%cvp5127> yes
[1:45:08] <%Metballs> Did the frame rate get WORSE? My god...
[1:45:09] <PastaL> This is like Fire Walk With me for DP
[1:45:09] <+ZipperHands> yes
[1:45:09] <nukle0nik> this game runs so poorly you'd think they're making the switch run a ps3 emulator
[1:45:10] <%Piemen99> SO HERE I AM
[1:45:10] <%CalderGaming> EVIL SOUTH
[1:45:10] <Eger007> yes

[1:45:36] <BoneofMalkav> I can answer that question, Yes the South corrupts, But the North corrupts inevitably. LUL
[1:45:36] <PastaL> The hitching is what fucks me up.
[1:45:37] <AFlyingTaco1> LUL yeah it was the South, not her fucked up upbringing
[1:45:38] <%Grimlockfly> Kreygasm dat framerate

[1:57:58] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @YakumoYomi It's a pretty fun time, Skyrim could've used a lot more fun romps like that
[1:57:58] <PastaL> The game ends when Willie is done showing you trees
[1:57:59] <Orenjevel> that 360 spin doesn't look right at this framerate. It looks like the models just freaking out
[1:57:59] <+krispen_wa> Waaaay underestimating
[1:57:59] <MrPedrovsky> 80
[1:57:59] <ranarath> No, you're closer to 60%
[1:57:59] <BallerSwagBro9k> More like 60
[1:58:01] <%Totally_Not_Toby> i have no idea how long this game is
[1:58:01] <dukenux> I remember Mulder shooting UFOs
[1:58:02] <%bread_assassin> There's only 4 chapters. And the 4th is really short.

[2:11:24] <SoySocks> psaJpeg

[2:11:25] <Roidgy> this is still a dream pat
[2:11:28] <%GabeSweetMan> The game was completed on boot.

[2:11:52] <SoySocks> woah that's a cool trick
[2:11:53] <%Totally_Not_Toby> i think you're pickle stone through the game
[2:11:57] <%Emperor_Machinus> Dog then proceeds to fall through the floor and clip through houses
[2:11:57] <TrashbagZombie> This is the final boss. Just a follow quest
[2:11:57] <%Jumpie8> to find Kaysen
[2:12:02] <ahaegotrigger> NICE
[2:12:03] <+Aeoneth> you are between 1% and 100% done the game
[2:12:04] <Mikizi> Are you solving that murder case, son?
[2:12:05] <saltyvest> This is actually the credits scene
[2:12:05] <+Estuko> SourPls .
[2:12:07] <%GabeSweetMan> If you count sidequests and the TOTAL grind, you're probably more like 10%.
[2:12:08] <Roidgy> this is the chillest murder case ive ever seen
[2:12:13] <PastaL> The Pickle is the final boss
[2:12:14] <%ringabal> Things start picking up around the third playthrough timeline
[2:12:14] <%GabeSweetMan> WILLIE WTF?
[2:12:14] <Tha_Mik> Probably
[2:12:23] <Roidgy> its both way worse and way better
[2:12:25] <+jiggy_snipe> JUKES
[2:12:26] <%DappercatEsquire> The first game is, by nature, more novel than this
[2:12:26] <BallerSwagBro9k> Stoey here is really good tho
[2:12:29] <%Ragnvaldr_AGH> Willie you fuck
[2:12:29] <%GabeSweetMan> Did he ENTER a yard just to leave it?
[2:12:29] <PastaL> That fence nearly fucked you
[2:12:33] <%clockworknate> The dog is actively trying to lose you lol
[2:12:33] <SoySocks> i like the side quests and side characters a lot more in the first game
[2:12:35] <Orenjevel> what the hell dog
[2:12:35] <%Totally_Not_Toby> Pickle stone %
[2:12:37] <%bread_assassin> I'd agree with that.
[2:12:41] <%rumtumtugnutz> SNAAAARF
[2:12:41] <%Grimlockfly> DP 2 is kind of 'half assed' in comparison
[2:12:43] <%GarbageQueenEllie> This doggo is gonna lead you to Hell
[2:12:48] <Gendreavus> Dog had to pee in that person's yard
[2:12:51] <cavefishes> 69%
[2:12:54] <cavefishes> NICE
[2:12:54] <+hawaiianprince8oh8> there was a person that just spawned into the world
[2:12:54] <phatballlz54> first game had Quint
[2:12:55] <TrashbagZombie> This is like the Dragons Age 2 of Deadly Premonition
[2:12:57] <%DappercatEsquire> @PatStaresAt The sidequest rewards are significantly more substantial in the first game
[2:12:57] <PastaL> The first game had like three different follow that dog sequences, though
[2:12:59] <%blankwaffle> yeah tbh I like the first one better
[2:13:00] <Ell1ot> do you think you'll have to do this again on another character like in the first deadly P?
[2:13:00] <%ringabal> @PatStaresAt Probably because its a Switch game that its more limited
[2:13:01] <%GabeSweetMan> Shoestring budget for both games.
[2:13:03] <+hawaiianprince8oh8> this game looks jank as shit
[2:13:04] <+NickNackProductions> was that content good though lol
[2:13:04] <%Wallabri> nice
[2:13:05] <+jiggy_snipe> just a single candy bar
[2:13:05] <%Emperor_Machinus> But does it have dalmatian chase scene?
[2:13:09] <ahaegotrigger> 69% NICE
[2:13:11] <SoySocks> @PatStaresAt don't get scared in this part
[2:13:12] <%GabeSweetMan> Remember that DP1 launched at $30.
[2:13:14] <$dalmek> it's still pretty incredible though
[2:13:15] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @TrashbagZombie Is that a good thing or a bad thing?

[2:13:20] <$autcetera> @Grimlockfly In terms of QOL sure, but I think the story is really engaging
[2:13:21] <Roidgy> i like the first one better in general but i like yorks characterization in this way more
[2:13:21] <Tha_Mik> Oh boy
[2:13:21] <mikitty> lol omg run
[2:13:23] <penitentpentwitch> Time to practice your DBD skils

[2:13:24] <astrophizz> but it does exist, so that's good
[2:13:25] <%RedoctoberWolf> the games frame rate is purposely this bad just to make this follow quest challenging

[2:14:13] <+Deekman> go forward!
[2:14:13] <PastaL> Most difficult quest in the game
[2:14:14] <%blankwaffle> the longest dalmatian chase and sweet music
[2:14:17] <%Th3SmartAlec> don't take your eye off the dog
[2:14:22] <Mikizi> wait, is this a mainline quest?
[2:14:24] <+NickNackProductions> it feels like this is the opposite of DP1 where it was in development hell for years, whereas this game looks like it was made in an afternoon
[2:14:28] <PastaL> Maybe don't use skateboard
[2:14:28] <Orenjevel> those are each all high quality individual models
[2:14:34] <VJdarkworld> will the dog stop?
[2:14:34] <%rumtumtugnutz> the music in this game sucks
[2:14:39] <SoySocks> the weird funky music in the first game's dog chase is great
[2:14:39] <%DappercatEsquire> i miss the funky beats from chasing the dog in the first game
[2:14:41] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Game be all like "hump dog"
[2:14:42] <nukle0nik> this dog is taking the dumbest round round trip
[2:14:43] <%blankwaffle> @mikizi yes
[2:14:45] <%Ragnvaldr_AGH> how dare you

[2:19:19] <$autcetera> MEMORY LEAK PogChamp
[2:19:19] <%Laecerelius> This game is imploding as we watch

[2:19:28] <%warmnoid> this game could flatline at any moment
[2:19:29] <%Alpha8087> @PatStaresAt Is it weird that the framerate shits itself but the conversation runs just fine or am I having a stroke
[2:19:29] <Winner_92> i cant believe this game exists its amazing

[2:19:32] <dinnydanny777> What if Forest Kaysen is us, the player?

[2:19:44] <%clockworknate> Imagine this game remade with 2020 graphics?
[2:19:46] <%Laecerelius> Pat, you need more max speed until you can just destroy the game by skating
[2:19:48] <%TheHypestCripple> Patti takes off the wig and she's just Kaysen
[2:19:50] <+krispen_wa> This looks WORSE than pre-patch
[2:19:51] <%twistedj3ster> This crashed twice when I tried to manually save
[2:19:52] <%Valdorick> It runs like PERFECTION
[2:19:53] <dukenux> soggy framerate
[2:19:55] <SolsticeZro> still finished the game idc
[2:19:57] <dinnydanny777> This frame rate is ART
[2:19:57] <%GabeSweetMan> DID IT THO?
[2:19:58] <+hawaiianprince8oh8> what if better frame rate was a temporary buff? would you use it ?
[2:20:00] <%Tearonex> doodFps
[2:20:01] <PanicSwytch> IT WAS WORSE
[2:20:04] <Idon__> if anything they were UNDERstating it
[2:20:04] <boomstickery> this seriosuly doesnt run as well or looks as good aas Driver
[2:20:06] <AFlyingTaco1> "Improved"
[2:20:08] <%DappercatEsquire> Is Swery still being attacked for the trans stuff?
[2:20:08] <dinnydanny777> This low framerate is PART OF THE GAMES CHARM
[2:20:10] <Mikizi> They say a good director can work within their budget. Squarey made something unique right here, you gotta respect it
[2:20:11] <penitentpentwitch> It's gone from a wet crap to a dry one
[2:20:12] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> louisianna is 10fps in real life
[2:20:17] <%honeyman18> take a shit in the water tower
[2:20:24] <PastaL> Doesn't even run as well as DP1

[2:20:42] <Sol_Install> didn't know that for water towers
[2:20:43] <SolsticeZro> In Swery's logic a FPS patch for DP means to reduce the framerate further to
[2:20:44] <Sol_Install> make sense
[2:20:44] <%SilverDevilfish> I Shit in your water hahaha

[2:57:06] <AFlyingTaco1> The Evil Within?
[2:57:07] <+Rolandknight> I love seeing developers looking at this game and wondering what’s making the frame rate die.
[2:57:12] <Thepothero> Investigate this creepy shit yeyeye
[2:57:18] <Roidgy> @GGLinear the entire world loads when youre outside
[2:57:19] <%StarlingSilence> burn it, york

[2:57:32] <GGLinear> @Roidgy You're fucking kidding
[2:57:34] <%Aeoneth> See no evil, taste no evil, breath no evil, think no evil? Drink no evil?
[2:57:36] <boomstickery> thremodynamics?
[2:57:37] <PastaL> @GGLinear Yeah, this game was programmed by incompetents with no budget
[2:57:39] <%Typhaeon> Where can I major in FIRE DYNAMICS
[2:57:41] <%Th3SmartAlec> A PHD in Fire Dynamics
[2:57:45] <Roidgy> @GGLinear its rough man
[2:57:46] <%DedlokPM> @Idon__ You are asking the wrong question. They obviously had playtests. The right question is "Did the developers and/or publishers listen to anything the playtesters said about their findings during playtesting?" And given the stories about the publisher rushing it out the door, the answer is probably "No, they did not or did not care."
[2:57:53] <%Th3SmartAlec> WOOLIE NO
[2:58:06] <%arcielardor> YOPO
[2:58:08] <+RowenCleric> is this where they referred to her as a he before patching?

[3:03:39] <$dalmek> Friendly Koolguy
[3:03:40] <%juxtest> York forgot to tell anyone
[3:03:40] <+jiggy_snipe> its both a prequal and sequel
[3:03:41] <mikitty> DP1 is like 2011? i think and DP2 is 2005
[3:03:42] <MrPedrovsky> @sagata_ Pre-Sequel
[3:03:43] <%GarbageQueenEllie> She was hella kidnapped Cheryl style
[3:03:44] <hawkhollywood> patti could also be her moms name
[3:03:44] <$HyperionXV> THis is a sequel with a future and a present bit
[3:03:45] <Sagata_> OH OK
[3:03:45] <%StarlingSilence> chug chug
[3:03:49] <MattoBii> her *RECENT* disappearance, chat
[3:03:51] <+Deekman> Just like Zach can't have cancer because he's older later
[3:03:51] <%XeroSigmaPrime> disappearance is another word for dead
[3:03:54] <%clockworknate> Patti cant be dead, she was never alive, she was all in yorks head!
[3:03:54] <%doggettxalex> oh god
[3:03:54] <dukenux> oh ok nvm
[3:03:55] <penitentpentwitch> But her father was dead in 2019
[3:03:57] <ManlyMcBeefington> @Sagata_ past Before DP1, present is after DP2
[3:03:59] <GGLinear> No, ellie. If York screams persona I'm going to commit not alive.
[3:03:59] <%DedlokPM> @AFlyingTaco1 tall guy who was in love with lise
[3:04:01] <TioXyco> not gonna lie: even if the game is falling apart on the frame rate, and the dialogue is kinda weird sometimes, but the over "mistery" of the game seems kinda well structured
[3:04:01] <+azulezircon> ?
[3:04:02] <nilla_24> the game is dying
[3:04:03] <%possumwalsh1221> Being dead is a way to disappear to be fair psaSmug

[3:04:04] <Roidgy> CHUUUGGG
[3:04:05] <missingangle> ohhhh my god
[3:04:06] <morningmoondude> Pat: WAIT A SECOND game: ok
[3:04:06] <penitentpentwitch> The game took that comment literally
[3:04:07] <stabbityrabbit> Pat started streaming? How much have I missed Zach?
[3:04:08] <PastaL> That was like 9 Fpm
[3:04:09] <Tha_Mik> oh dear

[3:04:15] <%TheHypestCripple> The game *will* wait a second
[3:04:22] <Roidgy> York uses Za Warudo
[3:04:24] <%doggettxalex> doggettxalex subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! Framerate op
[3:04:26] <%Ragnvaldr_AGH> oooh good point actually

[3:04:55] <BlackDae> vibes of tire screetching
[3:04:55] <thatlolifrompersona1> Round 2 fight !
[3:04:56] <bluebiscuit94> So he's just acting the gentle giant trope, and he's actually smarter than he lets on?
[3:04:58] <Ralfclogs> jphDead
[3:04:58] <GGLinear> @GarbageQueenEllie No, I refuse. No way they go that stupid
[3:05:01] <TrashbagZombie> I miss the horrible tire screeches
[3:05:04] <GGLinear> At least I hope not
[3:05:09] <%ToneBacas> how severe is Paige's pineapple allergy ?
[3:05:09] <%LuckyLagomorph> v r o o m
[3:05:10] <PastaL> I like that Lena orchestrates all this postmortem like she's jigsaw
[3:05:12] <+LandOfTheWay> i can't wait for this game's OST to come out. the clarkson and fast travel themes slap
[3:05:14] <GGLinear> So many loading screens
[3:05:16] <%Allenora> It’s not mullet guy cause he’s king of the Clarksons now?
[3:05:16] <%ringabal> Is Avery gonna Flowers for Algernon us?
[3:05:23] <GarbageQueenEllie> @GGLinear No sanity. Body aching. Our outcry.
[3:05:24] <%honeyman18> I can hear the game engine screaming as that camera turned
[3:05:25] <LoneFonte> it does sound like a tekken song LUL
[3:05:25] <%possumwalsh1221> Y vroom
[3:05:43] <penitentpentwitch> I'm honestly surprised you never walked through that mirror
[3:05:48] <%clockworknate> Has pat figured out the mirror puzzle with the door yet?
[3:05:55] <%erohoney> he runs like Frank West. that's what it is
[3:05:56] <+krispen_wa> So is this whole plot because Lena got butthurt at her dad and Kaysen was like "yoo I got some drugs"?
[3:06:17] <stabbityrabbit> @brachydios777 That's a shame Zach. I guess we'll just have to catch the vod later.
[3:06:19] <%juxtest> David!
[3:06:24] <%clockworknate> that was weird
[3:06:33] <pokefan9956> INCEST BABY

[3:06:43] <Kuj999> Candice
[3:06:45] <GGLinear> @GarbageQueenEllie I only just got the joke you were making and I hate it.
[3:06:49] <SolsticeZro> he pulled that picture out of his fingers
[3:06:49] <+Deekman> wtf does Sexually Liberated mean?
[3:06:53] <%PettyFunk> No audio for that line?
[3:07:03] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @GGLinear FALLING DOWN.
[3:07:03] <@SoFarFetched> LUL
[3:07:05] <+Deekman> nagged
[3:07:05] <%toastybites> NTR
[3:07:06] <%kyh9> bothered or annoyed
[3:07:06] <BallerSwagBro9k> DEEP SOUTH
[3:07:07] <+pectusumbra> cucked
[3:07:07] <%PettyFunk> Badgering
[3:07:07] <%Th3SmartAlec> WHAT LUL
[3:07:08] <MrPedrovsky> @deekman incest
[3:07:08] <%Typhaeon> What Paige does to you all the time
[3:07:09] <BlackDae> they totally just cut the VA and didn't replace it
[3:07:10] <%clockworknate> its an old term
[3:07:10] <%PettyFunk> Nagging etc
[3:07:11] <%rdark_ksu> being a nagging bitch
[3:07:12] <%Jekado> nagged
[3:07:13] <+xeros720> the older version of cuckholding
[3:07:14] <+LandOfTheWay> for those confused, the muted bits were the parts changed with the patch
[3:07:14] <+Deekman> henpecked = nagged
[3:07:14] <PastaL> Whoops, "brother" isn't that deadnaming?
[3:07:15] <+krispen_wa> LUL
[3:07:15] <%Dakuu75> oh crap... i'm gonna google that...
[3:07:15] <%maenos2> means to pester pat
[3:07:16] <Kuj999> @deekman Do you reaaaaally want to know
[3:07:16] <heartlesshealer> DEEP SOUTH
[3:07:17] <%MaSterChiEfin420blntNinjA> That line was probably changed by the patch
[3:07:17] <%kyh9> PATTI
[3:07:17] <nukle0nik> it's when a wife is badgering her husband
[3:07:17] <iosephe> "cuckoldry"
[3:07:18] <dinnydanny777> Did York just call her a whore?
[3:07:18] <%bread_assassin> Henpecked means like whipped.
[3:07:18] <%weissguard> It means Melvin's her bitch.
[3:07:20] <OvaltineDream> nliAhhh nliAhhh nliAhhh
[3:07:21] <ShichiNoBushi> Wife controlling her husband.
[3:07:21] <%Valdorick> ... So she married a black guy while having an incest baby to spite daddy?
[3:07:23] <%Psyramics> it's a man being nagged by his wife
[3:07:23] <@SoFarFetched> We're assuming the cut audio lines is from the patch Swery did.
[3:07:25] <+jiggy_snipe> (of a woman) continually criticize and give orders to (her husband or other male partner)
[3:07:25] <pokefan9956> ohhh noooo
[3:07:26] <+pectusumbra> oh wait, no, nagging
[3:07:27] <dinnydanny777> Henpecked is really common
[3:07:29] <%ElkRiverDog> Nagged
[3:07:29] <brachydios777> DEEP SOUTH
[3:07:29] <mikitty> deeeeep south
[3:07:32] <%StaceMcGate> They just removed all dialog of York deadnaming Lena
[3:07:32] <+Deekman> @Kuj999 I already know
[3:07:32] <Sunstalker> It means the girl is the boss
[3:07:32] <+jiggy_snipe> so maybe?
[3:07:34] <%possumwalsh1221> I think it means she got him to simp
[3:07:35] <%Agami23> @PettyFunk i think those got added with the update
[3:07:40] <%Ragnvaldr_AGH> oh

[3:07:44] <%kyh9> danny
[3:07:44] <+xeros720> i think henpecked got other connotations later
[3:07:44] <Djinnazz> Melvin
[3:07:44] <+terry_quest> ´deepcest
[3:07:44] <%Ragnvaldr_AGH> it's Melvin
[3:07:45] <mattdel92> Why is the audio going in and out for dialogue

[3:07:53] <BallerSwagBro9k> I KNEW IT
[3:07:54] <ultimate_joker_main> every time there's no voice line is because of the changes to the dialogue
[3:07:55] <+jiggy_snipe> PogChamp
[3:07:58] <mikitty> awwwwwwwwww
[3:07:58] <%DedlokPM> @PatStaresAt Henpecked is basically a wife that controls/says everything that husband does
[3:07:59] <+krispen_wa> MELVIN
[3:07:59] <AFlyingTaco1> So Lena pre-transition was Patti's father?
[3:08:02] <NEOFilly> :(
[3:08:04] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @GGLinear Persona soundtracks are great.
[3:08:05] <%possumwalsh1221> WHAT A FOOL
[3:08:05] <+Buzzkill983> :O
[3:08:05] <dukenux> WHAT
[3:08:07] <%medusasghost> oh :(
[3:08:07] <+krispen_wa> MELVIN IS KAYSEN?
[3:08:07] <+Deekman> @Kuj999 i didn't ask anything. I said what Henpecked meant
[3:08:09] <PastaL> @StaceMcGate York just called Lena "brother", though.
[3:08:09] <penitentpentwitch> Same gag as last game
[3:08:10] <%Allenora> Oh dang
[3:08:13] <CursedNobleman> @Zombrocom using a pre-transition name
[3:08:14] <+BIumen> BROTHER OF THE JOKER.....THE KING
[3:08:15] <BallerSwagBro9k> BETRAYAL
[3:08:18] <SolsticeZro> FOOLISHNESS MELVIN, FOOLISHNESS
[3:08:19] <Sartastic> not the suspiciously nice guy!
[3:08:20] <%juxtest> Its always the Sheriff!
[3:08:26] <wannabemoogle> save his wife
[3:08:29] <Kuj999> It was Melvin?!
[3:08:33] <%PettyFunk> So does this mean we're 2 for 2 on IT WAS THE LOCAL COP?
[3:08:33] <GGLinear> @GarbageQueenEllie They are. Now I just wish they'd fucking port Persona 3 to PC, too.
[3:08:34] <%possumwalsh1221> But W H Y
[3:08:36] <+krispen_wa> UUUH
[3:08:36] <BallerSwagBro9k> FeelsBadMan
[3:08:38] <%GabeSweetMan> Damn it Melvin! I started off liking him too.
[3:08:38] <$LuchaDePucha> it cant be
[3:08:42] <iosephe> The worst evil of all...drugs
[3:08:45] <Roidgy> ima kill ur whole family patti
[3:08:47] <BallerSwagBro9k> @PettyFunk YUP
[3:08:48] <brachydios777> That’s why he hates Lena
[3:08:50] <GGLinear> WHAT
[3:08:51] <+azulezircon> Moral of the story: Don't do drugs, kids.
[3:08:51] <+BIumen> god stop saying intercourse
[3:08:56] <+pectusumbra> oh shit, sis-cest
[3:09:01] <SolsticeZro> KKona yeha
[3:09:01] <Syrushmx> It happen again.....
[3:09:03] <Kuj999> Man I hate Melvin even more.
[3:09:03] <%toastybites> I guess this was the patched part
[3:09:03] <MegafanX> Deadnaming aside, it does seem like the type of gameplay element that would become confusing the more complex it gets
[3:09:03] <ultimate_joker_main> @PastaL the choice said brother but the subtitles said sibling
[3:09:07] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @GGLinear Atlus does hate money, but maybe they'll port more.
[3:09:11] <MegafanX> for example if Lena is "sister", so is Galena
[3:09:13] <+krispen_wa> The utter distain towards drugs...This is made by a Japanese guy for sure
[3:09:14] <BlackDae> if the people are called users does that make your drug if choice your stand?
[3:09:17] <%twistedj3ster> stop bringing it up, we know they fucked
[3:09:20] <$autcetera> not cis sis-cest either

[3:09:35] <GGLinear> @GarbageQueenEllie You can't say they hate money when they milked P4 as much as they did lol
[3:09:44] <PastaL> @ultimate_joker_main So, the choice wasn't changed, just the subtitles?
[3:09:45] <%possumwalsh1221> Put the tree in the candy
[3:09:45] <jbrachob> INCEST DRUG BABY
[3:09:45] <Kejang> all the changes just make it more confusing tbh
[3:09:46] <PirateMike_> Nah fuck em
[3:09:50] <%GabeSweetMan> Is this the scene that was patched so York consistently uses Lena's chosen name?
[3:09:50] <%ringabal> "Sou desuka."
[3:09:54] <%rdark_ksu> Your family tree is more of a wreath
[3:09:56] <%GabeSweetMan> Or is it later?
[3:09:58] <MegafanX> Can't say he hates drugs that much if he has Zach smoking weed nonstop
[3:09:58] <%Th3SmartAlec> Kreygasm

[3:12:27] <Goodvibes99508> inheritance?
[3:12:29] <GGLinear> @GarbageQueenEllie This is true. I think you're right. They'll do it eventually. Especially given how well Persona 4 did on steam.
[3:12:29] <MegafanX> I mean anyone who's been to the US knows American coffee ain't the best
[3:12:30] <Tha_Mik> Kill em all Zach
[3:12:32] <%PettyFunk> @doc_ock_rokc Hey, depends on where you go, but in the south yeah
[3:12:33] <Roidgy> yorks plan is always Kill Everyone
[3:12:38] <+toficque> not exactly
[3:12:43] <+krispen_wa> Kill the Clarksons so Melvin's wife is the one true goddess or soemthing
[3:12:45] <%Th3SmartAlec> this is the Anti Chris Redfield plan
[3:12:46] <%cvp5127> more incest?
[3:12:50] <%ringabal> Is this a Behelit situation?
[3:12:50] <+jiggy_snipe> it's a cursed bloodline Kappa
[3:12:53] <penitentpentwitch> Create a super god?
[3:12:54] <Thepothero> Kill everyone York rooGun
[3:12:57] <brachydios777> @doc_ock_rokc Everything is shit compared to American *insert here*
[3:13:01] <%Bane_Kaikyo> attack and dethrone god.... to then become as gods
[3:13:03] <Roidgy> BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
[3:13:03] <heartlesshealer> Lena's plan was to kill her entire bloodline, including herself
[3:13:04] <dukenux> Lena wanted to end the bloodline
[3:13:04] <Joustar_> american coffee: 1 drop of coffee, a cup of whole milk and creamer. VOILA!
[3:13:05] <%Jumpie8> I know it's the south but why did they have to bring up incest?
[3:13:06] <%possumwalsh1221> Something something blood purge
[3:13:08] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @GGLinear Cultural progression is beautiful in that way. Given enough time and money, lots of great things can happen.
[3:13:10] <morningmoondude> So, Lena and Candy are just like Pat and Paige?
[3:13:11] <+Delenay> do side quests?
[3:13:11] <hoodedlefty> Is the plan to give it all to Patti?
[3:13:13] <%ammobasket> a good cup of bad coffee provides the anger I need to really start my day
[3:13:14] <mikitty> the diner?
[3:13:17] <%DensityD> LUL
[3:13:17] <+krispen_wa> It's Silent Hill 1 or something with Melvin's Wife as the Alessa

[3:14:54] <GGLinear> USE A SLEEPING BAG ON THE FRONT PORCH OF THE STORE LIKE A HOBO
[3:14:56] <AFlyingTaco1> LUL NO YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED
[3:14:58] <%PettyFunk> You wouldn't be able to see an FK through the lid :(
[3:14:58] <hcsarg1986> Do we know who the big bad is yet?
[3:15:00] <%Dakuu75> wouldn't anything in those vending machines be melted, disgusting, sun-cooked mess?
[3:15:00] <@SoFarFetched> probably to trigger a cutscene it has to be specifically somewhere
[3:15:01] <PastaL> Buying cigs from a vending machine would be unrealistic.
[3:15:03] <Roidgy> EAT SOME FUCKING RAW BEANS YORK
[3:15:04] <%possumwalsh1221> It’s not the same psaDown
[3:15:06] <%honeyman18> Drink hot coffee on your skateboard york
[3:15:07] <Thepothero> rooNo
[3:15:08] <nightslink> It's not to York's liking Pat
[3:15:09] <%DappercatEsquire> Take a 17 hour nap, York
[3:15:12] <heartlesshealer> He put his sleeping bag in storage
[3:15:16] <GGLinear> @GarbageQueenEllie Perfect. That was the plan anyway

[3:15:36] <@SoFarFetched> more*
[3:15:38] <%CalderGaming> @hcsarg1986 ultimately it's Forrest Kaysen, but we're not sure who the final boss is within this game yet
[3:15:38] <brachydios777> Dis you know that coffee is bean juice?
[3:15:39] <%ringabal> lesw
[3:15:42] <%StaceMcGate> @PatStaresAt so what do you think is going on with the story?
[3:15:42] <AFlyingTaco1> Quint came back to fuck you over one last time
[3:15:44] <penitentpentwitch> Let the air in, Pat
[3:15:45] <%DappercatEsquire> @Cymen90 Can't get any better than this
[3:15:46] <PastaL> Some Freudian shit right there
[3:15:46] <SolsticeZro> brain commands it
[3:15:46] <TrashbagZombie> QUIVERING
[3:15:48] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Ive had 2 cups of coffee Zach but i still dont feel refreshed

[3:15:55] <Roidgy> i want the end of this game to be exactly the same as 1
[3:15:58] <%possumwalsh1221> Pat let me BREATHE
[3:16:00] <PastaL> Yawn fetish. Very oedipal
[3:16:03] <+LandOfTheWay> @hcsarg1986 we know that lena's behind saint rouge and that melvin's wife is actually both a clarkson and slept with lena to give birth to patti. that's about it so far
[3:16:04] <RedPanda25> Now you know how paige feels
[3:16:05] <%doc_ock_rokc> "You got a prudy mouth" - pats mouth
[3:16:05] <Meekest> I hate that noise
[3:16:07] <dukenux> ResidentSleeper
[3:16:07] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Man, I hope Patti didn't get DP 1 act 2'd
[3:16:13] <pokefan9956> york slept for 20 hours and now the entire town is in flames
[3:16:18] <%walternatorz> "I need some coffee" *goes to sleep*
[3:16:20] <%PettyFunk> @brachydios777 More like juice made from the stone of a cherry
[3:16:20] <%TheHypestCripple> you have tons of coffee in your inventory pants
[3:16:22] <%DappercatEsquire> For what it's worth, I found the ending of this game pretty satisfying
[3:16:28] <heartlesshealer> (o'-')b
[3:16:34] <BakaDotExe> that alarm put me in a state of fight or flight
[3:16:36] <noyman2000> Hope she doesn't get soiled
[3:16:37] <PastaL> I'd love it if the game gave you a game over for sleeping too long
[3:16:43] <%possumwalsh1221> @dappercatesquire same I liked one more but this was still great
[3:16:47] <BallerSwagBro9k> Both me and Pat dying rn LUL
[3:16:51] <Kuj999> Who’s going to tell Pat he woke up at the wrong time
[3:16:54] <brachydios777> @pettyfunk Cherry juice? Then what about the coffee beans?
[3:17:01] <audrus> holy shit i just got here and the loading screen is loading its ass off i love it
[3:17:01] <GGLinear> @PatStaresAt I am going to suplex your game
[3:17:07] <Roidgy> THE DINER OPENED AT 5 PM PAT
[3:17:08] <SolsticeZro> Forest Kaysen wins again
[3:17:10] <bluebiscuit94> Remember stalkin Quint tho?
[3:17:11] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Like when Chie just chased the steak in Arena
[3:17:11] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Kuj999 SHHH
[3:17:13] <penitentpentwitch> What is this, Persona?
[3:17:14] <BallerSwagBro9k> Like P4? LUL
[3:17:14] <%ringabal> DP with Shenmue time limits. How horrifying
[3:17:15] <%StarlingSilence> gives you like an LA Noire game over screen
[3:17:18] <%DappercatEsquire> @possumwalsh1221 Agreed, first one was better, or at least more memorable overall, but DP2 ain't no slouch.
[3:17:19] <dukenux> That sorta happens in Deus Ex
[3:17:20] <TrashbagZombie> I reached this point and then fucked around for two weeks. Best FBI agent.
[3:17:20] <%possumwalsh1221> “You slept thru everything :)”
[3:17:22] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> how did york not realize forrest kaysen's dog in DP1?
[3:17:24] <%PettyFunk> @brachydios777 It's the pit of the "cherry", washed dried and roasted!
[3:17:24] <%JobbedBone> "officer solves case after 10 YEAR investigation"
[3:17:27] <Roidgy> o i thought you slept like 20
[3:17:29] <hcsarg1986> @LandOfTheWay I had a hunch that's what happened. I think Melvin is the bad guy.
[3:17:30] <%honeyman18> Patti has been missing for hours
[3:17:33] <GGLinear> What if it was only open for 15 minutes
[3:17:35] <GGLinear> lol
[3:17:35] <ItamarZel> are these leaves lagging?!?!
[3:17:40] <Roidgy> i cant physically look at this 2 fps game
[3:17:48] <powerprotoman> memory leak btw
[3:17:49] <%Totally_Not_Toby> memory leak gaaaang
[3:17:51] <morningmoondude> memory leakage
[3:17:52] <heartlesshealer> good
[3:17:54] <%ringabal> The simulation is collapsing
[3:17:55] <Drusain> memory leak?
[3:17:56] <GGLinear> This is my favorite slideshow
[3:17:57] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> start a new save
[3:17:59] <+pynkdoe> we warned you pat
[3:18:00] <brachydios777> @pettyfunk Interesting, well I learned something new today
[3:18:01] <%maenos2> think its like how fire embelm three houses had every version of the school overlaid at once?
[3:18:02] <Kuj999> I love it
[3:18:04] <TioXyco> maybe a memory leak? maybe rebooting helps?
[3:18:06] <%TehMud> Someone I know who played it said they had to reset the game or switch every few hours to get it back up
[3:18:06] <OnonokiNonon> This game is being unmade as you play it
[3:18:06] <%BinaryFireball> restart time?
[3:18:08] <penitentpentwitch> Hard save and restart the game?
[3:18:09] <%DappercatEsquire> I was really hoping it would be a Sunday and it would still be closed
[3:18:09] <bluebiscuit94> Game posted by memory leak gang
[3:18:10] <PastaL> Straight up quitting and reopening might fix it.
[3:18:12] <%BinaryFireball> memory leak is real
[3:18:14] <ItamarZel> OMFG I THOUGHT YOU WERE EXAGGERATING ON THE PODCAST
[3:18:15] <audrus> its lagging because that molten southern heat is overheating the switch
[3:18:15] <%possumwalsh1221> It’s loading in the drama
[3:18:17] <Kuj999> Oh
[3:18:18] <%GarbageQueenEllie> The game's gone too long- it's spent! Needs a cigarette.
[3:18:23] <mo0ody2090> If this game came out on pc would it be alot better ?
[3:18:23] <%ryome> Can get an exact count?
[3:18:24] <Kuj999> It’s out
[3:18:24] <+jiggy_snipe> this is the experience we deserve
[3:18:24] <%flashingknives22> flashingknives22 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 26 months! Hello Patster. Just wanted to say that my gf and recently adopted a three-legged dog and it reminded me of how Elmo is also kinda handicapped. Hope you're doing well.
[3:18:26] <+chattychocobo> i feel like im watching the switch's gpu melt in real time

[3:23:23] <+pynkdoe> the real villain is the time requirements
[3:23:26] <GGLinear> @PatStaresAt Save and just like, take a break man. I think the game is going to shit itself soon. God knows what that could do to your hardware if it's really doing this bad already

[3:24:23] <%DappercatEsquire> @PatStaresAt It's dumber than that, since you don't go into the cold storage warehouse at all
[3:24:24] <%RedoctoberWolf> I don't think the game would do that but I wouldn't hold it past it
[3:24:25] <%GarbageQueenEllie> That is bullshit. In any other game, you'd just break in

[3:25:02] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> uh oh
[3:25:02] <+ConLin_Arts_> does Pat know how many main missions are in the game?
[3:25:02] <Roidgy> no under the covers in this game
[3:25:05] <%GabeSweetMan> The first game is all about putting off DOING the main quest to 100% the side quests anyways.
[3:25:05] <PastaL> Saving is a pro tip
[3:25:05] <+Deekman> change your clothes
[3:25:06] <+jiggy_snipe> is the water pressure great now?

[3:25:25] <+minime234578> There was a second one?😳
[3:25:26] <%GabeSweetMan> You deliberately blow off the life threatening situations constantly in this series.
[3:25:28] <%Dakuu75> what is this, monster hunter? you have to eate before every hunt?
[3:25:29] <GGLinear> Why does this have like

[3:25:42] <%clockworknate> what happen to ghost of tsushima?
[3:25:42] <GGLinear> metal gear survive gauge mechanics lol
[3:25:47] <%honeyman18> Patti is basically shippped to like 40 different states in parts at this point right?
[3:25:54] <%poohtrailsnailcooch> anyone know if the Fan made Berserk Redux is worth watching?
[3:25:55] <%Laecerelius> Time is convoluted in Louisiana

[3:26:06] <BallerSwagBro9k> THIS IS WAAAAAY BETTER
[3:26:06] <PastaL> Agreed
[3:26:07] <%GabeSweetMan> And Tsushima is still on the docket right?
[3:26:08] <Shonen_hero> It's true
[3:26:08] <wannabemoogle> Patti is best
[3:26:09] <%Emperor_Machinus> Phantom of sushi mountain
[3:26:10] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> it sure is
[3:26:10] <%Valdorick> THIS IS THE REAL ACTION
[3:26:10] <user_naim> Food song sounds like ’Miracles’

[3:26:16] <%RedoctoberWolf> you aren't wrong
[3:26:16] <audrus> why would i want ghost of tshushima when we could watch a man shower and shave
[3:26:16] <brachydios777> @poohtrailsnailcooch Redux?
[3:26:19] <powerprotoman> pat can jsut wait to play ghsot of tsushima when it releases on xbox as halo infinite
[3:26:20] <OldManDeckardCain> more like GHOST OF LAMESHIMA
[3:26:21] <gekizenbu> is this New Anor Louisiana?
[3:26:21] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> only trash here bois
[3:26:22] <SolsticeZro> LUL somebody's gotta do it
[3:26:23] <%Metballs> GoT is real good, but it's kinda of a boring stream tbh
[3:26:24] <+chattychocobo> its simply a better game
[3:26:24] <Roidgy> i remember when you played tlou at the same time as dp1 and i i got disappointed when the new upload was tlou
[3:26:25] <GGLinear> Time in Lousinana seems to flow like in Dark Souls, Pat.
[3:26:25] <@SoFarFetched> @GabeSweetMan nah Pat said he was just going to play the rest of Tsushima by himself with how long it is.
[3:26:28] <PastaL> This is only grade a refined trash
[3:26:28] <BallerSwagBro9k> POGTRASH
[3:26:30] <%DappercatEsquire> Tsushima's basically just another open world waypoint-a-thon, minute to minute anyway
[3:26:30] <%DensityD> just a jpg
[3:26:32] <%twistedj3ster> Ghosts isn't in the DEEP SOUTH
[3:26:32] <audrus> and watch this wonderful loading screen
[3:26:33] <Kuj999> It’s fun, but DP2 though
[3:26:36] <PanicSwytch> Fuck ghost and fuck lou2
[3:26:36] <%afronooch> Honestly it is. Tsushima is great to play, but this is better to watch
[3:26:37] <cavefishes> trashfire or GOTY 2020
[3:26:40] <%GabeSweetMan> @SoFarFetched Ah fair enough.
[3:26:40] <%DensityD> good work pat

[3:26:54] <%DensityD> im pat
[3:26:54] <+Deekman> lmao that's how i'm playing it
[3:26:55] <audrus> i 100% this loading screen and it only took me 2 tries
[3:26:56] <%poohtrailsnailcooch> @brachydios777 I guess you haven't heard of it?
[3:27:01] <+Taglog7> good trash fire
[3:27:02] <%GabeSweetMan> This is a game I don't want to actually touch even though I bought it lol.
[3:27:02] <%octavian_gish> yeah, Ghost was super fun, got it all finished yesterday
[3:27:02] <AFlyingTaco1> There's more than 1 island?
[3:27:02] <%Allenora> honestly I am really interested in what’s happening though. Like I really like watching this game. I don’t know why though.
[3:27:05] <Kuj999> Congrats
[3:27:06] <devanmuse> go to woolie if you want good, fun games. go to pat if you want QUALITY
[3:27:09] <%possumwalsh1221> Ghost is SO GOOD
[3:27:09] <%Valdorick> That's rad

[3:27:38] <%clockworknate> Thats good to know now, have definitely been scrapin
[3:27:39] <PastaL> This may not be the stream we want, but it's the stream we need
[3:27:44] <%GabeSweetMan> Buy Swery's games! But don't play them either, they're trash lol.
[3:27:50] <%DensityD> york has strong knees
[3:27:50] <dukenux> DP2 needs Arnold S. mode
[3:27:50] <%PettyFunk> The fog clears when I clear one of the red diamond Mongol encampments, but do you mean when you finish the island's last stage the whole place clears out entirely?
[3:27:52] <GGLinear> Pat help, this game is giving me motion sickness. Do I just like, look at the facecam instead?
[3:27:52] <%AgniBrandt> I have actually been scraping the map you saved me so much grief
[3:27:53] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> I started Ghost of Tsushima and by that I mean Dragon's Dogman instead lol

[3:28:11] <%RedoctoberWolf> Hope this game makes enough money for d42
[3:28:14] <%poohtrailsnailcooch> @brachydios777 its mix of the movie and the anime to tell a more coherent story.

[3:32:22] <dinnydanny777> I can't believe Danny is the goddess of fertility
[3:32:22] <Drusain> you mean the person who hates trans people was the villain?

[3:33:11] <%cvp5127> pat will help
[3:33:11] <Aydarkzero> "love for justice"
[3:33:15] <%GabeSweetMan> @Drusain TBF, the transphobia was incidental to the evil being committed.

[3:33:23] <+Deekman> if you power through you'll get this game done in about 1-2 hours from now
[3:33:24] <GGLinear> Are we supposed to be Zach, or is that just some BS character he's talkin to?
[3:33:27] <%Niney_Who> FERTILE CRAB
[3:33:28] <CappuccinoGuil> THE LINE WAS WRONG

[3:33:53] <Zombrocom> Zach is Zach
[3:33:58] <pokefan9956> 10 bucks CLG stands for something else
[3:34:00] <@SoFarFetched> @GGLinear this is all explained in Deadly Premonition 1 on who Zach is,since this game goes back to stuff that happened in the first game.
[3:34:08] <%Garthunox> just 1 hour left
[3:34:10] <penitentpentwitch> And lo, the orbs did multiply

[3:34:16] <%DappercatEsquire> @PatStaresAt Are you ready to be introduced to a new minigame type at the ass end of the game?
[3:34:16] <Gallhint> Was he fucking that barrel?
[3:34:16] <CappuccinoGuil> @GGLinear there's a whole game explained it better, but in a way, it's the player
[3:34:16] <$autcetera> Zach is Zach, York is York
[3:34:18] <heartlesshealer> Don't ask about Zach. It's a personal matter.
[3:34:19] <%PettyFunk> @pokefan9956 Clarkson Lena Galena
[3:34:29] <Aydarkzero> why's he humping that barrel?
[3:34:30] <%RedoctoberWolf> FK
[3:34:33] <dukenux> Patti is in one of these barrels
[3:34:36] <+FoolsArcade> @PatStaresAt I feel like this game is just watching York not figure stuff out and it just sorta works out even moreso than the first one

[3:54:19] <%Kyoshikei> but usually its SNAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARF
[3:54:20] <Sartastic> it doesn't sound like snarp to me
[3:54:25] <Roidgy> Im GOnna CUT CHU
[3:54:32] <%GarbageQueenEllie> snarf snarf
[3:54:38] <Sartastic> snip snip snip
[3:54:39] <Tha_Mik> Snip snip
[3:54:41] <%StaceMcGate> snip snip sniiiiip
[3:54:57] <Roidgy> you see it symbolizes.... fear if.. emasculation
[3:55:00] <brachydios777> Snarf over heaven
[3:55:02] <%StaceMcGate> I can't wait till the final boss only has 1000 hp and dies in 8 hits
[3:55:03] <%Typhaeon> Snik, snik, SNIK
[3:55:06] <%PettyFunk> The door guys that say UGH SNARF do actually sound like their death cry is being played in reverse
[3:55:14] <%GabeSweetMan> I'll admit these enemies are way more memorable than the "rando zombies" of DP1.
[3:55:20] <Roidgy> every boss in this game is reaver
[3:55:29] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Listen... I concede that "SNARF" is way funnier... I even heard that at first too.... but after hearing the rest of that enemies barks and seeing the scissors, I can't unhear the P in there
[3:55:36] <%DappercatEsquire> It's gotta be a testament to how little playtesting hear that they didn't notice the death lines cut off like that
[3:55:52] <%StaceMcGate> last two bosses both had 250 hp in 1st form, and 750 hp in 2nd form. They didn't account for the gun charms whatsoever
[3:55:52] <%weissguard> LUL
[3:55:52] <%GarbageQueenEllie> I want the boss fight to get cheesed in one hit like last time
[3:55:53] <Roidgy> @GabeSweetMan idk those backward zombies were iconic to my childhood
[3:55:53] <%GabeSweetMan> They actually have a design instead of being "a dude/lady".

[4:35:23] <Sartastic> that's one hot dead body
[4:35:27] <mikitty> I don't trust Simon
[4:35:30] <PastaL> @GabeSweetMan It seems like Zach left out everything red tree related
[4:35:36] <JunkyardCrow> Aaliyah is York for music instead of movies
[4:35:37] <anewure> 🤔🤨😣
[4:35:45] <ElbyBoxus> and red seeds
[4:35:47] <%GabeSweetMan> @PastaL Ah that'd be why.
[4:35:47] <MayShip> i don't trust any dumb character in this series
[4:35:48] <PastaL> Which is why Aaliyah is extremely suspicious of Zach
[4:35:50] <+xeros720> not the red seeds huh
[4:35:51] <%abrupt_abe> I mean, yea?
[4:35:51] <KingKZ> And the seeds
[4:35:52] <Gallhint> Is quint anywhere on that poster board?
[4:35:52] <%AncelDeLambert> I'm still amazed at the RIVER of bodies York wades through in DP1 after apparently knowing as much as he does at the end of this case
[4:35:54] <+xeros720> okay good
[4:35:56] <BaslerJones> but what if York
[4:35:56] <dinnydanny777> Hey remember when Aaliyah talked about how beautiful that dead body was, that was fucking weird huh
[4:35:57] <penitentpentwitch> Forrest Kaysen: "Ha!"
[4:35:58] <+xeros720> oh come on
[4:35:59] <%possumwalsh1221> Hmm hmm seeds family hmm
[4:36:03] <%twoto858> Thye know nothing about Kaysen, huh
[4:36:03] <BaslerJones> What if we bring back York
[4:36:03] <+krispen_wa> IDIOT
[4:36:06] <+krispen_wa> DUMBASS
[4:36:08] <Sartastic> why not ask him
[4:36:08] <+BIumen> oh my god they never noticed the seeds were there indepedently of zach???
[4:36:09] <%MaSterChiEfin420blntNinjA> psaWhat
[4:36:11] <%takutoots> maybe...
[4:36:12] <reonome> dammit aaliyah
[4:36:13] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> BAKA
[4:36:13] <Picosunloaded> eye power
[4:36:14] <%Maids4lyfe> Davis you dumb ass the seeds were there first
[4:36:15] <%AncelDeLambert> Like, fuck you, York, you already know about the red seeds and it takes you as long as it does?
[4:36:16] <+xeros720> well, any information about Kaysen is probably being suppressed
[4:36:17] <Tha_Mik> You can do it
[4:36:19] <+azulezircon> Oh? So he also grew those red trees, Miss Davis?
[4:36:20] <+jiggy_snipe> has Kaysen been using Zach all along
[4:36:23] <AFlyingTaco1> I forgot, who was the Raincoat Killer in the first game? Was it Zach's dad?
[4:36:28] <KingKZ> She kinda sucks at her job.
[4:36:32] <JDebss> @caldergaming the answer is always yes
[4:36:34] <reonome> george
[4:36:34] <hcsarg1986> I'm gonna be honest I like Simon more than Aliyah.
[4:36:35] <+krispen_wa> it was Woods
[4:36:37] <Floofiie> @AFlyingTaco1 It was the cop, george woods
[4:36:38] <Roidgy> @AFlyingTaco1 was george
[4:36:39] <%steep_brize> psaUp
[4:36:39] <%AncelDeLambert> Why does Zack hold on to the Red Seeds considering he knows what they are?
[4:36:43] <+jiggy_snipe> @AFlyingTaco1 it was Geroge
[4:36:46] <dinnydanny777> @aflyingtaco1 Sherrifd
[4:36:47] <%AncelDeLambert> Like, they're a portal to a world of pure evil
[4:36:49] <cavefishes> god shut up simon
[4:36:50] <%Maids4lyfe> @AFlyingTaco1 it was the father of the wheelchair man in the gas mask
[4:36:52] <%GabeSweetMan> @AFlyingTaco1 It depends on which Raincoat Killer you're talking about.
[4:36:54] <morningmoondude> STFU Simon
[4:36:59] <PastaL> Such as Pizza?
[4:37:02] <%GabeSweetMan> But George was "the culprit"
[4:37:02] <$autcetera> Simon and Aaliyah are both good characters
[4:37:03] <%juxtest> @Aflyingtaco1 The first Raincoat Killer was Mr Stewart's dad. The second was George the sheriff
[4:37:04] <AFlyingTaco1> Oh, right. Thanks guys.
[4:37:04] <ElbyBoxus> just say karma bruh
[4:37:05] <ChoculaUltra> are we still 100% sure Simon isn't evil?
[4:37:08] <+Delenay> ehhhhhhhh
[4:37:09] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Simon thinks he Kreia
[4:37:10] <%DappercatEsquire> @AncelDeLambert They're pretty much inert unless you do some weird shit with them
[4:37:10] <ranarath> @AFlyingTaco1 It was the sheriff, George. Well, the very first one was Harry's dad.

[4:37:38] <Drusain> I also had an anchovy pizza and that was a big betrayal
[4:37:38] <KingKZ> That's the literal worst
[4:37:38] <%possumwalsh1221> PIZZA IS GOD NOW
[4:37:41] <Profmcstevie> Damn straight lytJACKPOT
[4:37:42] <%AncelDeLambert> @DappercatEsquire fair enough
[4:37:43] <%Agami23> look at the pizza, think its a cheese pizza. then it turns out the cheese is eggs and the sauce is ketchup
[4:37:43] <+jiggy_snipe> Simon is just Dante wearing a costume
[4:37:45] <Ell1ot> i hate secret anchovies
[4:37:45] <%Maids4lyfe> pat why the fuck are you eating pizza with toppings you don't know about?
[4:37:47] <dukenux> I bought a takeout pizza, and it was BURNT :(
[4:37:50] <Roidgy> I READ THEIR MINDS BITCH
[4:37:52] <Pnutz409> but its honest. nothing is ever secret on pizza
[4:37:53] <%AgniBrandt> That's not the pizza's fault.
[4:37:54] <%HRDSalami654> Pineapple belongs on pizza!
[4:37:55] <dinnydanny777> Anchovies pizza is fantastic
[4:37:56] <Sartastic> body cameras... good for cops too!
[4:37:56] <%AgniBrandt> That's the chef's fault.
[4:37:57] <%DappercatEsquire> Pizza betrays me every morning after I eat it
[4:37:58] <mattdel92> The biggest betrayal IS pineapple on pizza
[4:38:02] <%AgniBrandt> Or the waiter.
[4:38:02] <ThDark> The piece sign almost looks like a pizza, if you really think about it
[4:38:05] <kehnimentu> pizza bettyal where it looks good and only tastes like hot grease
[4:38:07] <PastaL> When you hear her talk about his cases, York sounds like a bad FBI agent.
[4:38:09] <phatballlz54> Simon maybe a dumbass but goddamn do i respect his Pizza philosphy
[4:38:10] <+xeros720> yeah, the goal doesn't fit the murders
[4:38:12] <%Maids4lyfe> PUT WHATEVER YOU WANT ON PIZZA IT'S ALL GOOD
[4:38:13] <%AgniBrandt> Pineapple on pizza is delicious
[4:38:15] <dinnydanny777> burnt pizza > undercooked
[4:38:19] <%Xevtes> @dukenux thats rough
[4:38:20] <%doc_ock_rokc> Canadians couldn't stand beside the Frankenstein monster they created so they called it Hawaiian
[4:38:23] <%PettyFunk> There have to have been cases of human sacrifice, there was one with those teenage girls just a few years ago
[4:38:26] <Drusain> the anchovies melt into the pizza and ruin the whole thing
[4:38:26] <PirateMike_> Shut the fuck about pineapple on pizza already it's been done to death
[4:38:27] <+krispen_wa> Wait...is Zach an unreliable narrator?
[4:38:28] <ha2ken> Like pizza

[4:38:46] <vaderxyz1970> In the end it will be Flying Spaghetti Monster vs the red trees in DP3
[4:38:47] <+jiggy_snipe> Prof R. is Lena
[4:38:47] <%AncelDeLambert> I find it hard to believe that the FBI has NO records of human sacrifice of any kind. There has to be at least ONE psycho who's done it

[4:39:58] <brachydios777> This is true
[4:39:59] <xxshadowxx416> simon
[4:40:00] <%AncelDeLambert> the problem with York is that when you break your case thanks to the voodoo man who appears in the mirror and told you to bowl, you can't really write up a coherent report

[4:41:23] <Guardiansaiyan> @dinnydanny777 where York is concerned...does it even matter?
[4:41:28] <+SH1NK1R0> But fruit is just a seed grenade........so "the principal thing" is still the fruit
[4:41:33] <hcsarg1986> Simon's right human's don't always make sense

[4:41:40] <%doc_ock_rokc> she got her sister....again

[4:51:14] <PastaL> It's his fairy. Why is this confusing
[4:51:15] <SolsticeZro> yeah dont worry about it
[4:51:15] <wannabemoogle> I think it looks like Emily

[4:51:28] <%DappercatEsquire> very
[4:51:29] <Guardiansaiyan> Aaliyah is a bit of a BITCH...you know
[4:51:33] <+Hayasage> Very
[4:51:35] <%AncelDeLambert> @Agami23 ... gonna need to be a bit more specific, there
[4:51:37] <%tigerfang86> kinda a lot

[4:51:41] <mattdel92> Yes
[4:51:43] <TheQuadrupleS> INCREDIBLY STUPID
[4:51:43] <dinnydanny777> Can they see the fairy?
[4:51:48] <a_mad_dragon> PIZZA
[4:51:49] <dinnydanny777> They can't see it can they
[4:51:49] <%DappercatEsquire> @AncelDeLambert Emily
[4:51:50] <phatballlz54> Knock her out!
[4:51:54] <PastaL> @Guardiansaiyan she is veery stubborn
[4:51:55] <+azulezircon> He literally pointed Simon in the right direction, lady.
[4:51:58] <+krispen_wa> Aaliyah always gets CLOSE to be likeable, but then nosedives into bitch again
[4:52:00] <whimsicallifestyle> zach did kind of assault her
[4:52:03] <%AncelDeLambert> Ah, York's squeeze
[4:52:03] <huskarl_zap> trenton bad place lol
[4:52:04] <+Buzzkill983> It's not that you are dumb, it's Zach is so good
[4:52:06] <+chattychocobo> they cant see the fairy they just think york is crazy
[4:52:06] <%Skelegroove> She already went over how he magically solved several cases by himself
[4:52:10] <samura1_queen19> If Tinkerbell is flying around will Morgan have the ability to fly?
[4:52:21] <%Agami23> @AncelDeLambert emily, i forgot her name. but the fairy does kinda look like her
[4:52:26] <%DedlokPM> @dinnydanny777 if they could they probably would have commented on it by now. but they have heard him refering to and talking to it
[4:52:28] <TurtlesAndTentacles> I'm sorry, we're suppose to like Aly
[4:52:28] <Guardiansaiyan> @PastaL being stuborn is different than being someone with a personal bias against York/Zach all because theya re good at their job

[4:52:30] <Roidgy> H E L L
[4:52:36] <%abrupt_abe> KAYSANNNNNN
[4:52:40] <PastaL> She reminds me of Skyler. Completely right to be angry, but quite unlikeable
[4:52:41] <dinnydanny777> Why do they say Saint Rouge correctly but can't say Le Carrè correctly?
[4:52:43] <TurtlesAndTentacles> I find it hard to like her at all
[4:52:45] <%AncelDeLambert> how many agents of the Red Room are OUT THERE?
[4:52:48] <olaksi> Refusing to let suspect loose isn't stupid, chat
[4:52:49] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Those red fuckers did ruin his life, I'm not surprised he's dedicated his life to them

[4:53:37] <%GarbageQueenEllie> you stupid cunt
[4:53:39] <vaderxyz1970> She was told to find it
[4:53:40] <%albret__einstrong> York is fuckin' like 50 years olds tops
[4:53:41] <PastaL> Zach has been fucking with her from the start. He kind of brought this on himself.
[4:53:44] <dinnydanny777> I just realised who that is
[4:53:45] <%Rain_Mage> The only thing that can beat Zach is cancer
[4:53:50] <+krispen_wa> I can never accept Aaliyah as the new protagonist at this point
[4:53:52] <phatballlz54> i liked her too...
[4:53:54] <SaltyAzteca> Life is beautiful...right? BibleThump
[4:53:58] <Blunder_Blue> @albret__einstrong 42, I think.
[4:53:59] <%DappercatEsquire> To Aaliyah's credit, York seems like an old crazy weirdo
[4:54:00] <dinnydanny777> Zach is 40
[4:54:00] <RedTako> BibleThump
[4:54:01] <TurtlesAndTentacles> YOU DON'T BELIEVE ANYTHING CAUSE YOU'RE NEEDLESSLY SUSPECIOUS. FUCK. I HOPE THERE IS NO 3 CAUSE I CANT STAND HER
[4:54:05] <dinnydanny777> He's 40
[4:54:07] <+DoktahDoktah> Anybody else feeling GET ON WITH IT!
[4:54:13] <%DappercatEsquire> *Zach
[4:54:20] <%AncelDeLambert> this is some George Lucas "bring balance to the Force" shit
[4:54:26] <tolloponik> Cancer is a bitch
[4:54:31] <%afronooch> Zach is 40 with Stage 4? Cancer
[4:54:31] <%albret__einstrong> To be fair, York has been fucking with her non-stop the whole time
[4:54:31] <Pookiedaexzile> God damn it Aaliyah WE Need a Resolution
[4:54:32] <Guardiansaiyan> Vote for Patty as the new Zach/York

[4:54:40] <+abrupt_abe> I want to go get food but damn this story is interesting
[4:54:41] <%GarbageQueenEllie> I'd be cool with Patti being the protag in 3
[4:54:44] <%Th3SmartAlec> Avery with the X Factor
[4:54:45] <PastaL> The game weirdly set her up to always be wrong about literally everything.
[4:54:48] <$autcetera> I like this stuff a lot
[4:54:48] <@SoFarFetched> yeah I figured
[4:54:49] <morningmoondude> What if Avery can henshin into RED COAT?
[4:54:49] <anewure> the fact that she did know about the red seeds before hand... like what has she been doing all this time?
[4:54:49] <%possumwalsh1221> Okay but Aaliyah’s pov she’s talking to a guy that constantly talks to himself out loud I’d be suspicious too
[4:54:50] <%AncelDeLambert> these two are the worst possible proteges to hand the Red Room problem to
[4:54:56] <%DappercatEsquire> Also, Zach did try to choke Aaliyah to death like 10 minutes ago. I think her apprehension is warranted.
[4:54:56] <BaslerJones> Aaliyah will be the new York
[4:54:57] <%GabeSweetMan> How do you confuse them?
[4:54:58] <anewure> didn't *
[4:54:58] <Gendreavus> I'm getting a weird sense of deja vu with this, and it's not for DP1...
[4:55:00] <@SoFarFetched> but I didn't wanna say it's because they looked alike just yet.
[4:55:01] <AFlyingTaco1> So the VODs go up how long after a stream, again?

[5:05:22] <%Valdorick> STAND: Crawling in my skin
[5:05:22] <CappuccinoGuil> There are a lot of blessings in disguise in this game, huh?
[5:05:23] <%DedlokPM> @flagi64 the Special Edition stuff is no longer canon. They left all of that out of the Switch Rerelease

[5:05:42] <reonome> the blessing in disguise was the friends we made along the way
[5:05:44] <%ChaosAethr> Camera is off center
[5:05:45] <%MelBrooksKA> Perhaps the real treasure was the cancer we go along the way
[5:05:47] <@SoFarFetched> @psimon_ Yeah Who York was is explained in the first gamae.
[5:05:48] <morningmoondude> This stream is a blessing in disguise

[5:06:19] <%albret__einstrong> everyones yelling at aaliyah for not believing York like he doesn't build his entire case on being able to enter a demon otherworld
[5:06:23] <+azulezircon> You know there's a line?!
[5:06:25] <%ChaosAethr> Pat Camera is off-center a bit
[5:06:27] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Oh, you've LEFT the line, woman

[5:06:47] <%Skelegroove> They broke into the room he told them not to enter
[5:06:48] <%Valdorick> Zach and York are FUCKING MAGIC so of course she's going to be skeptical
[5:06:48] <PastaL> Aaliyah: I don't know what's going on, but you're not making sense either
[5:06:48] <dukenux> yep
[5:06:49] <PE4X> but hes so charming
[5:06:49] <%GabeSweetMan> She's totally justified to be PISSED.
[5:06:50] <NEOFilly> this is true

[5:17:47] <PirateMike_> 0 out of -10
[5:17:47] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Dividing 10 by zero results in error, btw

[5:17:51] <%ammobasket> what a scale

[5:17:56] <%Rain_Mage> Game of the Minute, 10/0
[5:17:56] <Profmcstevie> N/A out of 10, cannot be judged by conventional means

[5:18:06] <%valriot> Kreygasm
[5:18:07] <%JonathLP> "10/0 A masterpiece for no one!"
[5:18:09] <+Loinclothiclese> Voooooooore
[5:18:11] <boomstickery> but its painful hwo much better it could have been if they didnt even give you a chance to run around, the bits in one area are the best
[5:18:13] <%Aeoneth> That's a Tree? I thought he was using a Nintendo Power Glove
[5:18:18] <CappuccinoGuil> That booty ain't bad
[5:18:19] <Kuj999> Shot on the 🍑
[5:18:20] <Pookiedaexzile> Mo Ass shots than a Southenr Strip club
[5:18:20] <Guardiansaiyan> @Profmcstevie agreed
[5:18:20] <nightslink> This game is the best
[5:18:21] <mikitty> big chained enemy kinda looks like Avrey
[5:18:22] <Joustar_> Pat stop doing trick cake shots
[5:18:23] <dukenux> Deadly Premonition 2 is definitely a game
[5:18:23] <$autcetera> I give this game a NaN/10
[5:18:24] <ahaegotrigger> Vooore
[5:18:29] <Monkeyweed21> We need a Conan review scale for this
[5:18:30] <penitentpentwitch> Not much enemy variety
[5:18:30] <Guardiansaiyan> @Aeoneth it can be both
[5:18:30] <%rdark_ksu> i hope this last boss fight is the dumbest of all
[5:18:32] <dinnydanny777> Why do the Patti enemies have a ladge ass, that's fucking weird
[5:18:32] <%tigerfang86> SNAAAAARF
[5:18:36] <+RowenCleric> SNARF
[5:18:41] <%SilverDevilfish> Snarf/Cancer
[5:18:42] <trasherxl> pity otherworld is the same everywhere - just the insides of Clarksons barn
[5:18:43] <sleepy_pixels> dmc doors
[5:18:43] <PirateMike_> Snarf sounds like a LOTR goblin
[5:18:43] <BaslerJones> DP1 had more effort put into but the plot on this is one is better
[5:18:54] <the_doc_of_pepper> uuuh
[5:18:55] <Monkeyweed21> I much prefer this to the endless bad Resident Evil sections of DP1
[5:18:57] <%Quigsies> I'll definitely pick it up when it's cheaper/runs better
[5:19:00] <%StarlingSilence> yeah
[5:19:00] <dinnydanny777> She totally is saying vore
[5:19:00] <%YakumoYomi> "Nani the fuck?! outta ten"
[5:19:01] <@SoFarFetched> yeah does feel like this has less
[5:19:02] <+krispen_wa> Voooo-
[5:19:04] <%MechArch> story is better
[5:19:04] <+chattychocobo> true
[5:19:05] <Ell1ot> i miss the milk barn
[5:19:08] <SomersaultJustice> that was probably on purpose
[5:19:09] <PastaL> Yeah, but this also has no budget
[5:19:10] <Pookiedaexzile> Its the MAss Effect 2
[5:19:13] <%DedlokPM> @CappuccinoGuil a) When I said "hand'; gun I meant the magical "hand" gun b) if he still has the "hand" gun then why couldn't he used it in DP1, which was after Le Carre?
[5:19:16] <+chattychocobo> i miss the old fast travel noise
[5:19:19] <%thenumber5point5> the game can only be judged by the Lord...and he Hungers
[5:19:21] <%DappercatEsquire> DP2 feels like it tried to trade the expansiveness for more focus, but I don't know if that trade really panned out
[5:19:22] <Roidgy> this was made on $12
[5:19:23] <brachydios777> I get the scissorman and the lady, but what about door man?
[5:19:23] <PirateMike_> I miss having a car
[5:19:23] <$Savages4Blood> @patstaresat ok but this one has more talk about pizza
[5:19:24] <%albret__einstrong> yeah, but you didn't have to follow clint for 3 hours
[5:19:24] <+krispen_wa> Patti alone elevates the story above DP1
[5:19:25] <%weissguard> SNARRFFF
[5:19:25] <%twistedj3ster> It's on the Switch, they had to cut corners
[5:19:26] <%possumwalsh1221> Yeah this sequences are all the same and the first had specified areas
[5:19:28] <SolsticeZro> it's a good story after DP1
[5:19:29] <%Valdorick> Thinking playing the first game would have this make sense
[5:19:30] <wannabemoogle> Patti shitting on york is the best
[5:19:31] <SaltyAzteca> oh void
[5:19:31] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> oh
[5:19:32] <+azulezircon> The first game also had a bigger cast, which made the town feel like it was actually inhabited.
[5:19:32] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Sweary learned to reel back on some stuff
[5:19:33] <PastaL> I miss George driving us everywhere

[5:28:33] <%MrJerples> I don't understand, what happened to Francis?
[5:28:33] <TheDestinyPotato> except the bowling
[5:28:34] <+jabberwwock> I beat it easily with just the basic power +2 upgrade tbh
[5:28:35] <%Niney_Who> It was with melee
[5:28:36] <Monkeyweed21> much like how Lupus makes you a werewolf, Cancer makes you a crab person
[5:28:36] <Profmcstevie> Designed for a no upgrade run JUST IN CASE you don't know how to do any of it
[5:28:39] <SomersaultJustice> but they were bad though
[5:28:40] <hcsarg1986> First try!
[5:28:48] <%Skelegroove> DP1 also had those weird chase segments
[5:28:49] <OldManDeckardCain> BOWLING DID DEFEAT YOU THO
[5:28:50] <+xeros720> the original release was actually pretty difficult i recall
[5:28:50] <+Buzzkill983> The story is more important than the gameplay
[5:28:52] <+krispen_wa> DP1 was super easy in the Director's Cut
[5:28:54] <%DappercatEsquire> @PatStaresAt All of it's easy? Because I remember the Big Five kicking you ass up and down the lane.
[5:28:58] <%AzureGale> CRAB BATTLE
[5:28:58] <Monkeyweed21> DP1 gameplay also sucked ASS
[5:29:00] <%derekwst3> lady monster is just trying to call voldemort
[5:29:02] <dinnydanny777> Is it an infinite machine gun though?
[5:29:03] <wannabemoogle> Boss designs are on point tho
[5:29:04] <shotgang86> oh GOD
[5:29:06] <AFlyingTaco1> Hey man, if a hot girl with a big ass drops on me from the ceiling and starts calling out a bunch of tentacles, my clothes are coming off instantly
[5:29:07] <+xeros720> yeah, they dropped the difficulty down quite a bit
[5:29:09] <phatballlz54> DP1 had QTE's right?
[5:29:12] <%valriot> The first one was actually a game, but it was FUCKING AWFUL, so they made it super easy in the re release LUL
[5:29:14] <+shocknawful> Hes doing pretty good for an old cancer man
[5:29:24] <brachydios777> @phatballlz54 Yes
[5:29:24] <AFlyingTaco1> @phatballlz54 A few, yeah

[5:30:03] <%tigerfang86> BUT SO GOOD
[5:30:04] <%DedlokPM> First game they were shoehorned in because the publisher wanted "gameplay and challenge" this one they are probably just in because of "tradition of first game"
[5:30:04] <+krispen_wa> She only says VOOOOOID if she's alive?

[5:30:17] <CursedNobleman> the person that did the sound design for this game should be slapped across the face
[5:30:20] <%toolofparanoia> But its cool garbage

[6:21:59] <ShichiNoBushi> From the initial trailer, it seemed like she would be the main character with York as a cameo character.
[6:21:59] <psimon_> Patti signed a contract though

[6:22:03] <%linSP> This game was a billion times better than TLOU2
[6:22:04] <%StarlingSilence> jeff kramer has a real nice voice
