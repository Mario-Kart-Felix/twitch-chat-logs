[0:03:46] <%Mr_Pylon> Time for more Eye-Ron
[0:03:48] <+blastazoid00> The factory must GROW
[0:03:50] <cochramd1992> I was going to buy Satisfactory after seeing Pat playing it, but then I remembered that my graphics card is 10 years old.....time for an upgrade
[0:03:51] <%holydeviant1> well, not drunk this tim so
[0:03:56] <LoneFonte> Think we'll get to green science today?
[0:03:56] <amiavamp> Oh boy, he conquered the Satisfactory goblins, but Factorio has some for real goblins with pollution and time pressure
[0:04:11] <ChungusQuest> are GPU prices still beyond ridiculous?
[0:04:24] <%Dunmarkh> @amiavamp and limited resources
[0:04:25] <cochramd1992> I was about to ask
[0:04:26] <%lumporr> i mean my first factorio run i ran my factory pretty green and the bugs didn't bother me much
[0:04:27] <%afronooch> yeah
[0:04:29] <rafaelba93> if you can find any
[0:04:29] <%BinaryFireball> do you think pat and paige can dance in real life?

[0:05:30] <amiavamp> @dunmarkh yeah the limited resources actually halted my first megafactory, i was spending more time fighting enemies and building mines than anything, postgame
[0:05:40] <+blastazoid00> @ironohki Looks good to me

[0:10:55] <%coreywin1> I still just vibe with 1080 lol
[0:10:55] <Onamar> Whopping 5 FPS 8k
[0:10:57] <%MidnightBurst12> see in in 5-8 years then
[0:10:57] <%TheShisno> 4k 60 first
[0:10:57] <+PandaCavalry> beep beep. i'm ready to climb on to the struggle bus with some more factorio <3
[0:11:02] <%Mr_Pylon> It's Canadian 4k so it's worth about 2.5 US k
[0:11:03] <%lumporr> i STILL haven't had the OPPORTUNITY to buy a new console
[0:11:03] <@Moobot> I don't know if I can trust that. (@Bt_Robot) (warning)
[0:11:08] <%Ozavic> Hey pat, breaking my sub-ginity to celebrate a new job and a new puppy, the job is doing the tech for a finance place and the pup is a sprockerdile. Keep streaming buddy
[0:11:11] <Ipsenscastle> 1080 is fine by me
[0:11:12] <%brickwall35> what do you think they'll call the next PlayStation console?
[0:11:14] <bob900000> I thought the human eye couldn't see a difference after 4k
[0:11:15] <Consumanist> I'll be dead by then
[0:11:16] <%Landralin1996> Please no we're barely hitting 4k 60 :(
[0:11:17] <%hewlettfan96> 4K 60k all the way
[0:11:18] <ergulor> Goodbye
[0:11:19] <amiavamp> im over here still on 1080p60fps like a caveman
[0:11:23] <%SaiyanShoto> Clip it so we can show 10 year future Pat if he’s right or wrong
[0:11:25] <+D00msDayDan> docseuss is based
[0:11:25] <Kalarchis> 4k isn't even standard yet
[0:11:29] <CappuccinoGuil> Many sads were had
[0:11:35] <LoneFonte> Adios was great
[0:11:37] <%BinaryFireball> 1080 is fine until you think about 4k boobies
[0:11:40] <%Mr_Pylon> Adio was big great sad game
[0:11:47] <+D00msDayDan> the factorial
[0:11:48] <+EdenOfLove> so the PS5 having 8K output is just kinda pointless futureproofing?
[0:11:48] <+other_badger> HOO
[0:11:51] <LoneFonte> HOO

[0:26:30] <sirtommygunn> Blizzard is a fucking mess
[0:26:30] <@commanderclaw> It's been bad longer than it's been good
[0:26:31] <aQuietSigh> WoW is too old. It needs to stop.
[0:26:34] <%asgard147> Who still plays WoW anymore?

[0:27:03] <%holydeviant1> even for free
[0:27:04] <GustauveVIII> I still play WoW. It was fun for like 2 months. Then the grinding popped in and I fell off HARD.
[0:27:05] <%LtSurge> Aren’t they named cocker spaniels?
[0:27:07] <%JoshManVGH> It's a series of excuses to get players to raid level. Raiding seems to be THE game in. WOW
[0:27:08] <Explodincatz> MoP was the best expac
[0:27:09] <ISKMogul> Maybe if Blizz stopped firing everyone WoW would be better

[0:28:16] <cherrycottontail> @Pengers this expansion is really good. 2nd or third best easy.
[0:28:16] <+SergeEXE> ye
[0:28:17] <%lumporr> nice and clicky
[0:28:17] <+patel347> oh thats nice
[0:28:18] <notapolack> delicious click
[0:28:18] <$CantWalkGood> Turned down for what?
[0:28:19] <+b_aleph> I thought this game was about neat iron things, not disgusting gross maggots and bugs
[0:28:19] <%JoshManVGH> clicky
[0:28:20] <%Dunmarkh> yee
[0:28:21] <+sulf> its a little subtle
[0:28:22] <+other_badger> cluck
[0:28:22] <Calek> it is a click I can hear
[0:28:23] <sirtommygunn> audible
[0:28:26] <+patel347> oh man cant wait till the robots
[0:28:29] <Profmcstevie> Clunky and clicky
[0:28:30] <$RealThiele> ngl i had no idea this game had a combat section. just figured it was factory get big
[0:28:30] <Tuna_Can_0> try not to die by your own trains atpRtsd
[0:28:30] <bonebagMEL> nice and clicky
[0:28:39] <%Ozavic> Can't wait till he gets to Rimworld, that game eats my life
[0:28:46] <amiavamp> the gross bugs want to fuck up your neat iron things
[0:28:51] <mattmmkay> it's basically not a game at all
[0:28:53] <%Dunmarkh> god fuck the tutorial
[0:28:54] <%Bluwizard21> Why you gotta go and make things so complicated?
[0:28:56] <Calek> 40 hours of Dyson Sphere Program transfered just nicely into this game
[0:28:57] <%Tuna_Can_0> @RealThiele alien bugs don't like pollution
[0:28:58] <mattmmkay> it's basically work
[0:29:02] <R3c0n31> So many tools, so many minimal tasks. Love it
[0:29:06] <%Bt_Robot> The real question is, do you have your factory production lines already planned out?
[0:29:07] <%asgard147> You can do this pat, learn the ways of industry to kill the planet limesEvil
[0:29:08] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> @PatStaresAt just wait until you get to liquid fuel processing
[0:29:09] <%MadPretty> Man, Rimworld is such a banger. The stories that game creates
[0:29:10] <$RealThiele> pave over the bugs ez
[0:29:11] <iosephe> 3rd run of the tutorial let's gooooo
[0:29:21] <%Infernal_Dalek> Ah, W A S AND D...I can see why you got stuck
[0:29:21] <cochramd1992> I can't wait until he tries Dwarf Fortress and goes insane
[0:29:26] <%Infernal_Dalek> woolieSMUG
[0:29:29] <Baddict> I put 50 hours into this game and everything barely functioned the entire time
[0:29:29] <ShadeTheNovice> Once you get it, it becomes alot simpler to understand
[0:29:31] <ChungusQuest> Never played this game, but I already have the urge to replace the BGM with Brood War Terran music.
[0:29:34] <darkjiku> I really love the old Fallout-style graphics of this game
[0:29:38] <+SergeEXE> Dwarf Fortress is so fun
[0:29:42] <amiavamp> man liquid fuel was such a tedious wall they had to simplify it
[0:29:44] <%Ozavic> @MadPretty I'm doing a tribal start this time, trying to make a colony of only gay men and it is going POORLY
[0:29:47] <%Landralin1996> If you CNTRL+click you can pull out everything from any container
[0:29:50] <Profmcstevie> This art style......pleases me
[0:29:51] <%Dunmarkh> sure.
[0:29:53] <LVL1_Scumbag> Not really
[0:29:55] <+BusterRepukken> @darkjiku but this looks nothing like fallout 3 ;)
[0:30:00] <%asgard147> "Hi Dad" psaDogchamp
[0:30:05] <%BinaryFireball> fuck food and water I want ooorrreeee
[0:30:09] <%Ziegsy> the art of the game is making me wanna play chaos engine
[0:30:15] <darkjiku> ... I meant Fallout 1?
[0:30:16] <+croten> Yup it is
[0:30:16] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt You can hold Right-Click on the ship parts to salvage it and get all the materials that make it. At least, you can do it in a normal game.
[0:30:19] <%legendfather_of_giants> yeah
[0:30:24] <%Infernal_Dalek> Is that snoring?
[0:30:25] <+sulf> theres actually a RTS mod that adds starcraft style unit control to it
[0:30:25] <+croten> Brood war was directly the main inspiriation
[0:30:32] <sirtommygunn> ah yeah i get that vibe now that you mention it
[0:30:33] <cherrycottontail> @Ozavic is there any male pregnancy? if not, YEAH, I'd imagine it'd be going pretty poorly
[0:30:38] <%asgard147> is he pouting? limesThink
[0:30:43] <darkjiku> its why I said "old Fallout style"
[0:30:44] <Laioken13> E
[0:30:50] <+ataboy76> a lot of the sprites have cool moving details when they're running
[0:30:52] <+b_aleph> 2d minecraft
[0:30:52] <%Daxalog> Lots of 3d pre rendered games have that aesthetic.
[0:30:54] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> SMEEEEELT
[0:31:08] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> Remember: the real enemy in this game is the trees.
[0:31:10] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Aim four coal drills at each other.
[0:31:11] <foxname96> @patstaresat FOR THE LOVE OF GOD Get far/long reach mod
[0:31:18] <%asgard147> ROCK AND STONE! limesYay
[0:31:21] <amiavamp> Fun fact, this game uses wayyyyy more vram than you'd expect
[0:31:23] <+b_aleph> when's the sims stream?
[0:31:24] <%Infernal_Dalek> You could also just pick up the smelter
[0:31:32] <munitalprats> shut up about mods rn
[0:31:33] <sirtommygunn> the real enemy in this game is yourself, from half an hour ago
[0:31:34] <+sulf> btw pat if your concerned with how much hand mining your doing that is only for the very beginning
[0:31:34] <%BoxNavy> oh wow i didnt think this game would be an isometric type of thing
[0:31:38] <munitalprats> let the guy play the game as it was meant to be
[0:31:41] <%lumporr> oh god i just realized i'm about to watch someone make factorio spaghetti, i'm gonna have a fuckin' aneurism
[0:31:42] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> @Spudnacious_Dynasty That's a galaxy brain move right there
[0:31:49] <%Ozavic> @cherrycottontail There is no pregnancy in Rimworld, because people would make baby farms and the creator knows it
[0:31:49] <%BinaryFireball> do you need food and water in factorio or is it all just factory stuff? the survivor premise feels a little strange
[0:31:55] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> You can feed a coal miner into another coal miner.
[0:31:59] <cochramd1992> coal for the coal god
[0:31:59] <%blastyoboots> Dilute everything from this chest or building hotkey is one of the most useful hotkeys you can use
[0:32:00] <+b_aleph> infinite coal
[0:32:02] <munitalprats> its just factory stuff @BinaryFireball
[0:32:05] <BwdYeti> It's just factory stuff
[0:32:07] <+other_badger> just factory stuff
[0:32:08] <+b_aleph> step 1: cover yourself in coal
[0:32:09] <%blastyoboots> The loot*
[0:32:11] <+other_badger> who needs flesh?
[0:32:11] <%asgard147> Industry! limesPoggers
[0:32:11] <Calek> @BinaryFireball the survial premise is fighting the swarm
[0:32:12] <amiavamp> @binaryfireball no food, only hp from enemy attacks
[0:32:12] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> @BinaryFireball no food and water. Only FACTORY
[0:32:13] <BwdYeti> /base defense
[0:32:18] <+Slushsoup> @patstaresat you can make the quickbar 1 row if you want
[0:32:23] <%Infernal_Dalek> @BinaryFireball Survival is mainly killing the Zerg horde
[0:32:24] <darkjiku> oh boy here we go
[0:32:24] <%BinaryFireball> ahh ok
[0:32:26] <%BinaryFireball> thanks dudes
[0:32:26] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> The Factory must grow.
[0:32:29] <%Ozavic> Just eat coal KAPPA
[0:32:32] <%lumporr> i assume no backseating right
[0:32:38] <sirtommygunn> woah damn thats a good idea pat
[0:32:48] <+Jaromero435> EZ Game
[0:32:48] <%BoxNavy> of course jermaIQ
[0:32:53] <%MelBrooksKA> He doesn't mind backseating for this game
[0:32:55] <%Infernal_Dalek> You can also have Burner-Miners feed directly into one another.
[0:32:56] <ShadeTheNovice> backseat only when pat wants help Im guessing
[0:32:59] <cherrycottontail> @Ozavic baby farms was exactly what I was thinking he'd need. A shame when one can't rely on a good baby farm
[0:33:03] <%Tuna_Can_0> NEW PB PogChamp
[0:33:03] <%Infernal_Dalek> So they mine coal and put it into one another
[0:33:09] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> The real Factorio begins here.
[0:33:10] <%Ziegsy> hello chat. how are we tonight? I have my covid vaccine tomorrow
[0:33:16] <munitalprats> its honestly hilarious because that shouldnt have run out of fuel
[0:33:25] <munitalprats> in real game logic because inserters fuel themselves
[0:33:28] <amiavamp> perpetual energy machine! until the coal deposit runs out...
[0:33:28] <%blastyoboots> Feed two coal burners into each other pat
[0:33:34] <%Tuna_Can_0> not the box NotLikeThis
[0:33:40] <TheFramedWarlock> Real Factorio hours
[0:33:42] <+sulf> stop it chat
[0:33:43] <+DrSmashy> yeyeyeyeye
[0:33:49] <%asgard147> The factory must grow Pat, you want the factory to grow right? limesEvil
[0:33:50] <munitalprats> Let the guy play the tutorial
[0:33:51] <%Dunmarkh> @blastyoboots you mean miners?
[0:33:51] <%Infernal_Dalek> lol
[0:33:52] <+patel347> fuck these alients
[0:33:54] <munitalprats> stop telling him what to do rq
[0:33:55] <+Jaromero435> G U N
[0:33:56] <sleepy_pixels> pro tip actually
[0:33:57] <%BoxNavy> monkaS ?
[0:33:58] <%JoshManVGH> Enemies?
[0:34:00] <munitalprats> let him l e a r n
[0:34:02] <+other_badger> pat why do you always read the people who use words wrong
[0:34:03] <%DrBunni> Pat I don't know if figured it out yet, but if you have two auto miners with their outputs facing eachother on coal, it will endlessly mine the coal
[0:34:04] <%BoxNavy> aliens monkaS
[0:34:08] <BwdYeti> Two mining drills they mean, point two coal drills at each other and they'll buffer coal
[0:34:09] <%JoshManVGH> Woah what?
[0:34:12] <%AncelDeLambert> die bugs, you don't belong in this world
[0:34:12] <+croten> Yeah rotate the burners so that the output is directly into the other, they will fuel each other permanently
[0:34:13] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> the aliens do not appreciate the Factory
[0:34:24] <%blastyoboots> Coal miners
[0:34:24] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> the natives must be quelled to ensure the Factory grows
[0:34:28] <%Infernal_Dalek> Youtube has better tutorials than the in-game, heh
[0:34:33] <BwdYeti> R to rotate
[0:34:35] <+croten> R to rotate
[0:34:35] <%DrBunni> output arrow on eachother
[0:34:36] <+KBGuilty> rotate the Triangle
[0:34:36] <Kalarchis> So this is Civilization + Minecraft + Starcraft?
[0:34:37] <+DrSmashy> point them at each other
[0:34:37] <%AncelDeLambert> @PatStaresAt it only works on coal
[0:34:37] <amiavamp> Factory stinks worse than Gief
[0:34:38] <%TheDullaMAN> If you feed two Coal Miners into eachother, they'll produce coal infinitely
[0:34:40] <cherrycottontail> But Pat, where is box?
[0:34:40] <%Dunmarkh> belts and arms?
[0:34:41] <+sulf> rotate the output into it
[0:34:43] <+other_badger> have them put into eachother like they're chests
[0:34:44] <+Slushsoup> aliens hate industrialization
[0:34:49] <andrew1ups> This isn’t halo 2
[0:34:49] <%MelBrooksKA> @TallGuyWithAHoodie All a bunch of comies
[0:34:50] <%Ozavic> I've had this game for like 8 million years but I've never touched it, I should change that
[0:34:51] <+Jaromero435> you have inserters take from the belts
[0:34:51] <sirtommygunn> it's not actually a good idea to do that pat
[0:34:52] <%AncelDeLambert> for COAL
[0:34:56] <+patel347> yeah it digs up more coal then it uses
[0:34:58] <+b_aleph> now they kissing
[0:35:01] <munitalprats> its not actually a good idea
[0:35:01] <GustauveVIII> that doesnt do much it just wastes coal
[0:35:05] <+patel347> you just grab it out
[0:35:06] <%Infernal_Dalek> They will acquire coal until they're full
[0:35:07] <%Dunmarkh> arm
[0:35:07] <%vivaldiva> perpetual motion!
[0:35:07] <BwdYeti> Ctrl click
[0:35:09] <+Brandon_Lovelace> Exited to see Pat's new addiction.
[0:35:09] <+KBGuilty> ctrl click
[0:35:09] <munitalprats> people are teaching you wrong, as a joke
[0:35:09] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> YOU DONT
[0:35:09] <+other_badger> just grab it with your hands
[0:35:09] <%Tuna_Can_0> now kith
[0:35:10] <KShirahama> take it from them
[0:35:11] <%TheDullaMAN> Just pull it from the fuel slot
[0:35:11] <%DrBunni> your grabbers
[0:35:13] <+croten> Build an arm to take them out
[0:35:13] <%lumporr> you can point an output directly at a machine and it'll feed it directly into the machine's inventory
[0:35:13] <%Infernal_Dalek> You can grab it or use inserters
[0:35:13] <+ccwettr123> @PatStaresAt it takes less than 1 coal to make 1 coal, so all coal you make is positive
[0:35:14] <+DrSmashy> it's only good for early game if you're rushing
[0:35:14] <+Jaromero435> That's a terrible tip
[0:35:16] <+b_aleph> aftter 9 months
[0:35:16] <amiavamp> manually
[0:35:16] <%AncelDeLambert> @PatStaresAt it's an early build technique for getting early coal, once you have belts don't bother
[0:35:17] <+meisnewbie> you can get the coal out of the fuel slot
[0:35:18] <Freyja_Wion> dig up, stupid
[0:35:19] <%DrBunni> grabbers
[0:35:19] <%lumporr> don't listen to these people
[0:35:20] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> What could take something out of a box?
[0:35:21] <%holydeviant1> use inserters to pull from one place and INSERT into another
[0:35:21] <+Onionchamp> its early game strats
[0:35:24] <+Zeplin666> ctrl click
[0:35:24] <%MelBrooksKA> Just take it out
[0:35:27] <+sulf> good :)
[0:35:27] <%BoxNavy> moon2W
[0:35:28] <+other_badger> good
[0:35:28] <+tigerfang86> Classic chat
[0:35:29] <%Infernal_Dalek> Lol
[0:35:29] <%Ozavic> GOOD
[0:35:30] <%asgard147> limesFeels
[0:35:30] <+tigerfang86> CLASSIC
[0:35:30] <+Slushsoup> Inserter can pull out items too
[0:35:32] <%AncelDeLambert> it's a NECESSARY tip for new maps
[0:35:35] <BwdYeti> It's an early game strat when your robot arms are slow
[0:35:35] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Some sort of arm
[0:35:36] <+KBGuilty> you can daisy chain them and never run out of coal early game
[0:35:37] <%Arancet> yay now we're free to say anything!
[0:35:38] <+Jaromero435> You have the belt wrap around the miner and have inserter take from the belt to the miner
[0:35:39] <%Tuna_Can_0> ok :)
[0:35:39] <sirtommygunn> good idea
[0:35:40] <%BinaryFireball> well shit guys
[0:35:40] <TheFramedWarlock> ONE GUY
[0:35:40] <+KBGuilty> its super usefull
[0:35:40] <KShirahama> good job chat LUL
[0:35:41] <+PandaCavalry> shift right or left click
[0:35:41] <%DrBunni> eh you'll do fine without that
[0:35:41] <%Dunmarkh> psaGoblin
[0:35:42] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Why did you start listening?
[0:35:43] <+PandaCavalry> i can't rmember
[0:35:46] <TheDr0t> make em force feed each other
[0:35:46] <%blastyoboots> Then pull fuel from fuel slot
[0:35:46] <%BoxNavy> jermaPluto
[0:35:53] <%spitelite> welp pats not getting anywhere
[0:35:53] <@SoFarFetched> Guys he's BARELY starting the game up and you're already throwing too much info shit at him.
[0:35:53] <munitalprats> You'll do fine without it.
[0:35:55] <%MelBrooksKA> It's a good tip to make them mine infinitely @PatStaresAt
[0:35:56] <%JoshManVGH> We lost our chance
[0:35:56] <RyuuAoi> Thanks, Monkeyweed
[0:35:56] <%blastyoboots> By hand
[0:35:57] <%Tuna_Can_0> atpRtsd4
[0:35:57] <%jnoble919> NotLikeThis
[0:36:02] <%blastyoboots> Hahahaha
[0:36:06] <Broken_Sonex> @PatStaresAt You'll forget to not listen to us
[0:36:08] <+other_badger> snores
[0:36:16] <ShadeTheNovice> let him fuck it up chat, he'll come back to us when hes crying for help
[0:36:18] <Calek> Chat is a firehose of tips, and Pat needs a glass of water
[0:36:23] <sirtommygunn> oh, eye-ron
[0:36:24] <GustauveVIII> @patstaresat you can make an L shape with the conveyor belts to self-feed the mining drills with inserters.
[0:36:24] <%lumporr> @MelBrooksKA but one of them has to be outputting coal for the rest of the stuff
[0:36:31] <%Broand> Doing a tutorial again?
[0:36:32] <%coward_man> are the numbers going up?
[0:36:32] <%Tuna_Can_0> that tip only really helps if you know what you're doing and want to rush the beginning base
[0:36:33] <munitalprats> He doesnt need fifteen billion tips
[0:36:37] <munitalprats> let him play the game
[0:36:38] <+sulf> ctrl right click to insert half stack
[0:36:42] <munitalprats> he's **literally in the tutorial**
[0:36:47] <%snackcanary> snackcanary subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 14 months! Wow 14 months!Anyways, Crypto junk seems less like a revolutionary new thing and more a shiny spin on artificial scarcity and class nonsense.Cool future I guess.
[0:36:49] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah he's doing tutorial again because his brain was fried doing it yesterday.
[0:37:01] <@SoFarFetched> But Chat needs to chill on factorio things.
[0:37:03] <%Dunmarkh> @munitalprats for the third time psaDab
[0:37:04] <%MelBrooksKA> @lumporr No, just grab as much coal as you need and they'll start back up, it's a poor mans chest
[0:37:05] <+b_aleph> a thick piece of coal for your stocking
[0:37:11] <@SoFarFetched> If they wanna tell him what to do so badly they should play factorio themselves LUL
[0:37:12] <GustauveVIII> @patstaresat you can make an L shape with the conveyor belts to self-feed the mining drills with inserters.
[0:37:16] <+Slushsoup> @patstaresat what do you think of the top down perspective?
[0:37:17] <%Tuna_Can_0> the box fried his brain yesterday atpRtsd
[0:37:17] <%Landralin1996> You should hit the ALT key
[0:37:24] <munitalprats> @Dunmarkh that shows that his brain has been getting overloaded lol
[0:37:34] <Calek> I never did the tutorial, still managed to automate science packs 1/2 and military pack
[0:37:38] <+b_aleph> and the F4 key too!
[0:37:39] <munitalprats> if he needed help he'd ask
[0:37:43] <+tigerfang86> boo
[0:37:44] <+tigerfang86> boooooooooo
[0:37:46] <%hewlettfan96> BTS looks like a massive head to ache
[0:37:48] <+other_badger> SAME JOKE
[0:37:49] <%lumporr> @MelBrooksKA chests are bad anyway your coal should be feeding directly into your machines/engines via conveyor belts and at the very END should be put into a chest
[0:37:51] <@commanderclaw> Delicious tasty pollution
[0:37:56] <hamborgini> gascoaline
[0:37:56] <%blastyoboots> Rox box
[0:37:58] <cochramd1992> what's that minigun on the lower left?
[0:38:06] <munitalprats> yum p o l u t i o n
[0:38:10] <%Ranryu692> Now THIS is coal production
[0:38:12] <%JoshManVGH> Pat: I push buttons. Chat: Make an arch reactor following these 200 easy steps!
[0:38:15] <munitalprats> @cochramd1992 its flavor for this stage
[0:38:16] <%MelBrooksKA> @lumporr At that point you won't be using burner drills
[0:38:22] <cherrycottontail> @cochramd1992 a e s t h e t i c s
[0:38:22] <munitalprats> destroyed machinery
[0:38:30] <+b_aleph> this game incentivizes the destruction of the environment
[0:38:33] <%Dunmarkh> @cochramd1992 an automated turret thtat's broken
[0:38:33] <%lumporr> @MelBrooksKA no, that's my starting setup too
[0:38:34] <LoneFonte> @cochramd1992 a destroyed turret :)
[0:38:45] <munitalprats> i love how the tutorial stages have spots with broken machinery
[0:38:49] <munitalprats> as in a "yo put this stuff here"
[0:38:51] <+CapnClassix> @PatStaresAt Planning to stream Rimworld at some point?
[0:39:00] <%MelBrooksKA> @lumporr It's an early game thing for when belts are too expensive and you need to manually feed everything
[0:39:03] <+sulf> still getting used to zangiefs incredibly heavy snoring :D
[0:39:08] <munitalprats> like the machinery over the iron ore spots is very clearly a burner drill
[0:39:18] <%Tuna_Can_0> cute factory <3
[0:39:28] <%czeekytv> purple @PatStaresAt
[0:39:32] <+b_aleph> @CapnClassix when you need rimmoney in rimworld, do you get a rimjob?
[0:39:34] <munitalprats> you dont need copper rn
[0:39:37] <%Tuna_Can_0> YEP
[0:39:42] <+Ritsu_sohma> Does he know about shift click and control click yet
[0:39:42] <%lumporr> @MelBrooksKA i mean i'd rather just be patient and have a satisfying setup than be doing weird burner chest shit
[0:39:56] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Does the tutorial mention you can rotate buildings post-construction?
[0:40:04] <BwdYeti> Need to pump up that coal
[0:40:04] <munitalprats> yes
[0:40:15] <%blastyoboots> One of the best hotkeys to map to a side mouse button is the hotkey to loot EVERYTHING out of a chest or building
[0:40:17] <ShadeTheNovice> this stream is gonna make me wanna start up Factorio again to optimize everything better than Pat isnt it?
[0:40:21] <GustauveVIII> @patstaresat you can make an L shape with the conveyor belts to self-feed the mining drills with inserters. The empty spot has to be adjacent to the output of the drill and that's where you place the inserter.
[0:40:27] <%blastyoboots> The gimme button
[0:40:29] <skrewarrior> you can pump directly into a furnace
[0:40:35] <KShirahama> @ShadeTheNovice yes LUL
[0:40:36] <%Tuna_Can_0> NO ELPERS
[0:40:38] <%Dunmarkh> @ShadeTheNovice guaranteed
[0:40:38] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Right click
[0:40:40] <munitalprats> If pat needs help, he'll ask for it like he just did
[0:40:41] <%caramelatte1> hold it and right click
[0:40:46] <+meisnewbie> the inventory autosort
[0:40:53] <A0N33> I just put it in the furnace then right click that stack.
[0:40:53] <bonebagMEL> shift or strl
[0:40:53] <+sulf> ctrl right click
[0:40:57] <+sulf> the object
[0:40:57] <bonebagMEL> ctrl*
[0:41:00] <%MelBrooksKA> @lumporr Okay, well then do that? It's just a tip for if you want to skip using burner drills + conveyors and get electric drills asap
[0:41:13] <+meisnewbie> if you want to drop things one by one, you can hover mouse over thing you want to drop into, then press z
[0:41:14] <%blastyoboots> Right clifkx
[0:41:22] <RyuuAoi> Pat is confuzzled again?
[0:41:25] <+b_aleph> this backtrack sounds so ominous...
[0:41:27] <%holydeviant1> Now if only there was a way to get fuel automated
[0:41:28] <+CapnClassix> @b_aleph No, I give them Kappa
[0:41:40] <%Ozavic> You just pick up less coal psaUp psaUp
[0:41:48] <+Ritsu_sohma> Z is only over the ground I think
[0:41:50] <%AlteisenReiseZ> sleepy baby psaDogchamp
[0:41:53] <%lumporr> @MelBrooksKA yeah but that tip is non-intuitive and based on moving to a point that pat knows nothing about yet
[0:41:55] <munitalprats> you'll also drop it on the floor too
[0:41:55] <RyuuAoi> Yeah brain not burnt out!
[0:42:04] <BwdYeti> Apparently it's not just on the ground anymore. QoL!
[0:42:05] <+meisnewbie> note that it'll also drop on the ground if you press z when hovering over it
[0:42:07] <%blastyoboots> Ooh you know the loot hotkey!!! :D
[0:42:12] <+patel347> you have them
[0:42:15] <glgzephyr> I just switched completely from biomass to coal power in Satisfactory and it felt better than most orgasms
[0:42:15] <+patel347> you need ot place them
[0:42:21] <%blastyoboots> Z also drop on belt
[0:42:34] <+Ritsu_sohma> ah
[0:42:36] <%Tuna_Can_0> pats brain is gunna look like one of those burners by the end of stream
[0:42:59] <%blastyoboots> Hold f to vacuum suck when running over a belt with stuff
[0:43:03] <+sulf> man they give u a tiny patch for the tutorial
[0:43:07] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> I believe you can go directly from mining drill to furnace, no belt or inserter needed?
[0:43:18] <+Slushsoup> You can zoom in and out with scroll wheel
[0:43:18] <amiavamp> This game is less mind gobliny later on when you have trains and bots
[0:43:24] <+meisnewbie> double kill
[0:43:24] <munitalprats> you can but he's not there yet
[0:43:26] <munitalprats> He'll learn
[0:43:34] <darkjiku> THE BOX LEVEL
[0:43:36] <munitalprats> this is a large hill right now  to cross
[0:43:38] <invalid_robin> @Spudnacious_Dynasty yeah, but this is the tutorial
[0:43:41] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> Breathe, Pat
[0:43:42] <LoneFonte> THE B O X
[0:43:43] <munitalprats> this is the longest tutorial level anyway
[0:43:45] <+croten> Ez
[0:43:46] <LVL1_Scumbag> Can he defeat BOX
[0:43:48] <doster504> baba is box
[0:43:48] <%BoxNavy> mokaS
[0:43:49] <+D00msDayDan> BUT BABA

[0:43:52] <%MelBrooksKA> !Pat at Risk!
[0:43:53] <%Arkfyre> but baba
[0:43:56] <%walternatorz> Pat has opted to fight the anxiety with anxiety.
[0:43:56] <%Tuna_Can_0> thank god there's water right there
[0:43:56] <%Dunmarkh> PUMP IT UP
[0:43:59] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> @PatStaresAt remember to breath manually Pat
[0:44:00] <ISKMogul> lay some pipe
[0:44:09] <%lumporr> pat press alt
[0:44:15] <+Slushsoup> Hydro power EZ Clap

[0:44:35] <%Infernal_Dalek> You need power pole
[0:44:38] <munitalprats> good job so far!
[0:44:41] <munitalprats> yeah yeah!
[0:44:42] <%Infernal_Dalek> Yes, you got this
[0:44:42] <%walternatorz> no pipe laying jokes?
[0:44:44] <munitalprats> keep coin!
[0:44:50] <%BoxNavy> pi-pipe... steam....
[0:44:54] <+croten> You're doing it perfectly
[0:44:59] <munitalprats> yup
[0:45:00] <%Monkeyweed21> BUT BABA
[0:45:00] <%Tuna_Can_0> make go better
[0:45:00] <+b_aleph> no hardwood jokes?
[0:45:04] <+meisnewbie> right click does 5
[0:45:10] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> remember: Aliens are only a nuisance, the real enemy in Factorio is the trees
[0:45:11] <+other_badger> he is learnding
[0:45:12] <KShirahama> Ctrl + Click does 5
[0:45:14] <%BoxNavy> w o o d
[0:45:16] <%blastyoboots> Poles :D
[0:45:17] <Calek> you did it man good job
[0:45:21] <%ConLin_Arts_> is he winning?
[0:45:22] <sirtommygunn> yes, lit, indeed
[0:45:23] <+sulf> electricity is the gamechanger
[0:45:25] <munitalprats> Electricity is making coal
[0:45:27] <AmuserName> now DA COAL
[0:45:27] <Ipsenscastle> Pat has said 'lit' so many times it has stopped being even slightly ironic
[0:45:28] <snivins> yeah electricity
[0:45:28] <+sulf> makes everything automatic
[0:45:29] <munitalprats> but coal is not making electricity
[0:45:34] <%Tuna_Can_0> Clap
[0:45:35] <%Infernal_Dalek> If you hold down click while placing power poles and moving, you'll automatically place them at furthest distance.
[0:45:42] <%BoxNavy> yes
[0:45:43] <rafaelba93> you can attach the burner to the engine direcly
[0:45:44] <%the_spng> the_spng subscribed at Tier 1. 
[0:45:48] <RyuuAoi> Gud job
[0:45:53] <%Tuna_Can_0> atpRtsd3 atpRtsd4
[0:45:53] <+patel347> it needs power
[0:45:56] <+PandaCavalry> YAY! go pat go!
[0:45:56] <+patel347> move the pole
[0:45:56] <%blastyoboots> That shift click works in Satisfactory too!!!
[0:45:59] <+Slushsoup> @patstaresat get ready for electricity spaghetti
[0:46:00] <munitalprats> no that was right!
[0:46:00] <LVL1_Scumbag> Yes. Embrace the spaghetti.
[0:46:01] <%Dunmarkh> OH NO
[0:46:03] <ISKMogul> move the pole
[0:46:15] <%Tuna_Can_0> You did it! :)
[0:46:15] <munitalprats> its full of coal!
[0:46:15] <$Hommando> I have 135 hours in this game and have never built a lamp
[0:46:17] <+meisnewbie> yessss pasta begins
[0:46:18] <glgzephyr> so I found uranium in Satisfactory. Is nuclear power a thing?
[0:46:18] <%lumporr> yay
[0:46:19] <%Landralin1996> Yay!
[0:46:20] <munitalprats> you need to consume more power!
[0:46:24] <darkjiku> its now powered, time to make those radars
[0:46:24] <munitalprats> but yes! thats right!
[0:46:26] <%holydeviant1> yay!
[0:46:27] <Dragovus> UNLIMITED POWER!
[0:46:29] <+patel347> make excess go into box
[0:46:32] <sirtommygunn> you got it
[0:46:32] <+InvertableQuasar> You can take the coal out of the burner to test it if you want
[0:46:34] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Good enough!
[0:46:36] <+croten> Inserters are a huge change from satisfactory
[0:46:38] <%Tuna_Can_0> The coal must flow
[0:46:38] <ISKMogul> By the way, you can mouse over something and hit Q to select that item to place it again
[0:46:38] <+meisnewbie> @glgzephyr yes, it's a fairly lategame tech, and also optional
[0:46:39] <Calek> @glgzephyr nukes sure are
[0:46:39] <%Neryl_> Neryl_ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 26 months! almost one year thanks pat stairs at
[0:46:43] <+croten> You can use them for everything
[0:46:44] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Excess into box is for closers.
[0:46:44] <%Infernal_Dalek> Need a psaDogchamp version of ResidentSleeper
[0:46:44] <+Slushsoup> You must construct additional Pylons.
[0:46:46] <%arcielardor> is Pat winning?
[0:46:52] <theKingRamses> make arm to throw excess into box?
[0:46:53] <%Daxalog> Remember your gun!
[0:46:55] <amiavamp> if you use a burner inserter it will power itself and can restart itself if theres a blackout
[0:46:56] <%Dunmarkh> The real factorio souls starts here
[0:46:59] <LVL1_Scumbag> and iron
[0:47:00] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> @glgzephyr yes. Uranium process is RNG based, and the good uranium is only found at a 0é3% probability!
[0:47:01] <munitalprats> Remember you have more drills and inserters and poles in your inventory
[0:47:03] <sirtommygunn> wow building a radar is a big jump from making iron plates
[0:47:08] <Kalarchis> This is giving me agita.  I'm gonna go make cookies
[0:47:08] <sirtommygunn> why would the tutorial work like this
[0:47:14] <%blastyoboots> Shift click moves a stack of items in Satisfactory too @patstaresat !
[0:47:16] <%M4T1A5> why?
[0:47:17] <%Daxalog> You need good gun or biters will come by and destroy it all
[0:47:18] <glgzephyr> the good uranium. FML
[0:47:20] <+Slushsoup> I’d love to watch woolie try this game
[0:47:22] <%Dunmarkh> why tho
[0:47:22] <+patel347> you already have a coal backlog rn though
[0:47:24] <+croten> One electric drill is plenty for coal Atm
[0:47:25] <munitalprats> you dont need more coal tho
[0:47:31] <munitalprats> its clogging the belt
[0:47:34] <%metalicblackcherry> plenty of coal
[0:47:39] <%Monkeyweed21> no you wont
[0:47:39] <+b_aleph> Why does Joe Biden play Chipp in GGXX? He's not even the president in that game
[0:47:40] <%metalicblackcherry> too much coal
[0:47:48] <tastehbread> you can use an inserter to collect coal into a box from where it's building up
[0:47:50] <+croten> Pat here's a QOL tip
[0:47:55] <%lumporr> yes
[0:47:55] <+sulf> its beginning to click
[0:47:56] <%AncelDeLambert> hooray
[0:47:59] <+sulf> see ya in 10000 hours
[0:48:03] <+patel347> now bring coal to the same belt
[0:48:10] <+croten> If you click and drag power cables they'll space themselves efficiently
[0:48:11] <%BoxNavy> electricity good...
[0:48:13] <%AncelDeLambert> now bring over coal
[0:48:18] <%holydeviant1> INSERTER HELPING
[0:48:19] <amiavamp> This game doesnt have an Awesome Sink equivalent and resources are limited so you dont always need to gather all the things
[0:48:25] <theKingRamses> power tho
[0:48:25] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> now coal
[0:48:27] <%Tuna_Can_0> just throw it on the ground atpRtsuspectd
[0:48:29] <%lumporr> but how furnace get coal
[0:48:30] <munitalprats> but no coal!
[0:48:32] <+patel347> you need to get the coal here
[0:48:33] <munitalprats> move coal!
[0:48:35] <%bigboy3d> snoring dog
[0:48:38] <munitalprats> YEAH!
[0:48:40] <%AncelDeLambert> but is Baba you?
[0:48:41] <munitalprats> SEE HE'S DOING IT!
[0:48:42] <%BoxNavy> furnace...
[0:48:43] <sirtommygunn> but... how to put coal in
[0:48:44] <tastehbread> he's doing it
[0:48:44] <Melchior_the_Wise> !uptime
[0:48:45] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 49m 4s.
[0:48:46] <darkjiku> HES DOIN IT
[0:48:50] <%lumporr> inserter need be adjacent to belt
[0:48:50] <darkjiku> THE FACTORY IS GROWING
[0:48:52] <+InvertableQuasar> Too close
[0:48:52] <PinoProxie> baba is coal
[0:48:52] <munitalprats> SO CLOSE
[0:48:55] <+InvertableQuasar> Yes
[0:48:56] <sirtommygunn> well, he's not wrong
[0:48:56] <+patel347> route the coal onto the copper belt
[0:48:57] <%Tuna_Can_0> more power make more gooder
[0:48:59] <+meisnewbie> he's beginning to believe
[0:48:59] <%BoxNavy> this is expert commentary
[0:49:00] <+Slushsoup> :’)
[0:49:01] <%Daxalog> Missing a belt under arm
[0:49:02] <ShadeTheNovice> the speghetti begins
[0:49:02] <+sulf> Pog
[0:49:03] <+Jaromero435> but how ingot?
[0:49:05] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> THE FACTORY WILL GROW!
[0:49:09] <+SergeEXE> I am enjoying this
[0:49:09] <LVL1_Scumbag> Oh this is gonna get weird
[0:49:11] <%Tuna_Can_0> HES DOING IT PogChamp
[0:49:13] <amiavamp> no splitter yet right?
[0:49:15] <+b_aleph> wut?
[0:49:17] <invalid_robin> @PatStaresAt The really shitty thing about these tutorials is that they don't give you all the tools you need to completely automate your base
[0:49:18] <munitalprats> YE DID IT!
[0:49:19] <A0N33> KomodoHype
[0:49:23] <+gespenst25> Oh boy, if you like tearing things down and starting again to ger it right is this a game for you.
[0:49:24] <LoneFonte> YEAHHHH
[0:49:26] <%Landralin1996> You can put the coal on the copper belt to be a bit more efficient, but not bad! :)
[0:49:27] <+sulf> @amiavamp not yet
[0:49:27] <+PandaCavalry> look at him go
[0:49:27] <%Tuna_Can_0> But now how thing get out?
[0:49:28] <%Arkfyre> he's doing it PogChamp
[0:49:31] <munitalprats> YEAAAAH!
[0:49:33] <RyuuAoi> Idk what Pat is doing, but he's doing it!
[0:49:33] <+thegreenbenis> Protip, you can put coal and copper on the same belt.
[0:49:35] <%tebari> yay!
[0:49:37] <TheDr0t> wait you can switch the droppind side on the grabber ?
[0:49:39] <%MelBrooksKA> The coal must flow!
[0:49:39] <%AncelDeLambert> fatty pig dog fat fatty
[0:49:40] <%holydeviant1> FACTORY
[0:49:41] <+gespenst25> But where copper go?!
[0:49:43] <%BoxNavy> you. did it.
[0:49:43] <+patel347> yes
[0:49:45] <invalid_robin> Yup
[0:49:45] <BwdYeti> Belts have two lanes
[0:49:46] <DianaTheAscian> nice
[0:49:49] <+sulf> stop it chat that doesnt matter
[0:49:49] <%blastyoboots> Satisfactory waits until you’re how many hours in for a recipe that takes two??
[0:49:51] <ShichiNoBushi> Factory, oh!
[0:49:51] <+D00msDayDan> mixed belts, son
[0:49:51] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> Belts have two sides, yeah
[0:49:51] <sirtommygunn> i should make an SMG
[0:49:51] <iosephe> Belts can carry two things
[0:49:51] <%lumporr> belts have two sides
[0:49:53] <%Tuna_Can_0> just make a submachine gun 4Head
[0:49:53] <amiavamp> but you can put 2 rows of copper on the belt instead
[0:49:54] <+croten> Yeah belts have 2 sides
[0:49:56] <%AncelDeLambert> @PatStaresAt there are two sides to every belt, you can put whatever on them
[0:49:56] <%M4T1A5> yeah belts have two sides
[0:49:57] <+PandaCavalry> there are 2 sides to a belt
[0:49:59] <ColRedyx> Belts in Factorio have two lanes.
[0:50:00] <munitalprats> belts have two sides
[0:50:00] <+patel347> yeah
[0:50:00] <%BoxNavy> make gun
[0:50:01] <+Jaromero435> you can put everything on the same belt techincally
[0:50:02] <invalid_robin> @PatStaresAt You see how the coal and copper are all on one side
[0:50:03] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> @PatStaresAt just make sure the sides of the belt dont mix
[0:50:03] <+thegreenbenis> They have two lanes.
[0:50:03] <%Landralin1996> Belts have to sides
[0:50:05] <LoneFonte> just merge them
[0:50:05] <%lumporr> inserters always put things to the far side of a belt
[0:50:06] <+croten> You can have copper on the left and col on the right
[0:50:06] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt Each belt has two sides. It won't pollute the other side.
[0:50:09] <rafaelba93> internalize how the lanes work
[0:50:10] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[0:50:10] <+patel347> yes
[0:50:11] <%DiscoMatador> Machine gun do good
[0:50:11] <h8t0r_m4rs> yeah
[0:50:13] <munitalprats> YEYEYE
[0:50:14] <sirtommygunn> gonna need a bigger gun
[0:50:14] <+patel347> yeyeeeeeesdsssss
[0:50:14] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> PRODUCTIVITY SON
[0:50:15] <+Slushsoup> Belts have 2 sides
[0:50:15] <+croten> Perfect
[0:50:15] <%Landralin1996> BREAKTHROUGH!
[0:50:16] <%AncelDeLambert> he has learned
[0:50:18] <munitalprats> no it will!
[0:50:18] <%Daxalog> Dont. worry about that yet.
[0:50:19] <invalid_robin> No it will
[0:50:19] <+b_aleph> I WANNA DRIVE THE TRUCK
[0:50:20] <ColRedyx> Yes, it will grab from both sides
[0:50:21] <%Tuna_Can_0> POGGERS
[0:50:21] <%lumporr> it inserts both
[0:50:21] <munitalprats> it'll insert it!
[0:50:22] <%blastyoboots> Two sides of belt
[0:50:23] <%AncelDeLambert> they're full, Pat
[0:50:23] <+PandaCavalry> mind. BLOWN
[0:50:23] <+patel347> it does both
[0:50:23] <+InvertableQuasar> It will insert both
[0:50:24] <munitalprats> it doesnt need coal!
[0:50:24] <+sulf> it does
[0:50:25] <%lumporr> no it inserts both
[0:50:25] <+croten> It will
[0:50:25] <%Dunmarkh> IT WILL
[0:50:26] <+patel347> its just full
[0:50:26] <%lumporr> it does
[0:50:26] <%Broand> Pat is directing brainpower from speech functions to solve problem
[0:50:27] <+other_badger> it does
[0:50:27] <+D00msDayDan> it doesn't insert the coal because it's full on coal
[0:50:28] <%AncelDeLambert> they're FULL
[0:50:28] <AmuserName> it insert BOTH
[0:50:28] <Calek> it's full on coal
[0:50:29] <h8t0r_m4rs> its full
[0:50:29] <+gespenst25> iT WILL IF IT RUNS OUT
[0:50:29] <%Daxalog> Give it a momment
[0:50:30] <+TheEvaFreak> yes it does just wait
[0:50:30] <%Broand> coal full!
[0:50:30] <%Arweynn> cause they full
[0:50:30] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt It inserts both sides.
[0:50:30] <$PaleBloodInk> Because it doesn't need coal right now.
[0:50:30] <LVL1_Scumbag> Neuron activation
[0:50:30] <%coreywin1> nah it will, just only when it gets lower
[0:50:31] <ColRedyx> It will when it needs the fuel.
[0:50:31] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> no, it'll do both
[0:50:31] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> he just got a major concept of the entire game now lol
[0:50:31] <%Landralin1996> It will when the furnaces need more
[0:50:31] <tastehbread> it'll do both
[0:50:31] <+thegreenbenis> Yes it does.
[0:50:31] <amiavamp> Inserters deposit on the opposite lane of the belt
[0:50:32] <%Dunmarkh> BELIEVE IT PAT
[0:50:32] <GunEden> its full
[0:50:32] <invalid_robin> @PatStaresAt It insters it when it needs it
[0:50:32] <Radioactivetaco9> coal is full
[0:50:33] <+InvertableQuasar> They don't need coal right now
[0:50:33] <A0N33> It only inserts as much coal as it needs
[0:50:34] <hamborgini> inserters have a specific range
[0:50:34] <%tebari> They already have coal
[0:50:34] <KShirahama> it does
[0:50:35] <+PandaCavalry> it will do both but only when it needs the coal
[0:50:36] <darkjiku> it does, you just have too much coal in the sfurncace
[0:50:36] <munitalprats> it just doesnt keep filling on coal
[0:50:37] <+derrigible> now you need space for an output belt on the other side
[0:50:37] <%ZeOrbling> when they need coal they will fill
[0:50:38] <%MelBrooksKA> Full of coal
[0:50:39] <munitalprats> it'll fill as much as it needs
[0:50:39] <Psyramics> take the coal out and see what happens
[0:50:39] <invalid_robin> @PatStaresAt For like a max of 5
[0:50:40] <%Broand> COAL FULL!
[0:50:40] <ShadeTheNovice> its full on coal
[0:50:41] <+thegreenbenis> Coal full
[0:50:41] <%Tuna_Can_0> The inserters are smert
[0:50:42] <+Ritsu_sohma> It only eats coal when needed
[0:50:42] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> it only inserts up to 5 coal
[0:50:43] <%blastyoboots> Yeah belt it into side
[0:50:43] <+Jaromero435> they are full
[0:50:43] <BwdYeti> Coal burns for a long time
[0:50:44] <+patel347> remove it from the top pat
[0:50:44] <skrewarrior> furnaces cap coal ate ~5 to limit stockpiling
[0:50:45] <%lumporr> inserters are smart
[0:50:46] <+croten> It doesn't need to because it has coal
[0:50:46] <%Daxalog> Arm is smart
[0:50:47] <LVL1_Scumbag> It doesn't insert coal if it already has coal
[0:50:47] <KShirahama> only when it's needed
[0:50:47] <%AncelDeLambert> oh no he's Baba-ing again
[0:50:47] <+thegreenbenis> Coal is full.
[0:50:48] <$Hommando> They will not fill with coal
[0:50:48] <ColRedyx> Take the coal out of an inserter or furnace and it'll replace it.
[0:50:49] <LoneFonte> @patstaresat take the coal out to test
[0:50:49] <%blastyoboots> HE GETS IT
[0:50:52] <%BinaryFireball> pat loves coal
[0:50:55] <+D00msDayDan> @PatStaresAt if you want to test it you can pull the coal out of the furnace
[0:50:55] <+Slushsoup> Furnace full
[0:50:56] <sirtommygunn> top ones are inserting coal first
[0:50:59] <%tebari> take out the other inserters
[0:51:01] <%M4T1A5> just remove the second coal one
[0:51:04] <%blastyoboots> it does when it needs to
[0:51:06] <+sulf> take one of your coal drillers
[0:51:07] <$Hommando> Those inserters will only grab from the bottom part of the belt
[0:51:08] <RyuuAoi> Pat WILL figure it out.
[0:51:08] <bonebagMEL> would a loopty loop help?
[0:51:10] <+sulf> for iron
[0:51:12] <CrimsonFox777> Eye-Ron HyperReveal
[0:51:12] <%Daxalog> Hes gonna run out of bullets and get killed by bugs isnt he?
[0:51:14] <munitalprats> no copper
[0:51:15] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Geeze 51 mins in and only 800 people watching?
[0:51:17] <%blastyoboots> Coal full it’s doing it
[0:51:17] <munitalprats> you're out of copper
[0:51:18] <%Arweynn> 'full' in inserter terms is like, 5/60
[0:51:18] <ShichiNoBushi> How iron-ic.
[0:51:20] <huskarl_zap> I just fill the coal manually
[0:51:22] <BwdYeti> ( Ratio is 1 drill to 2 furnaces )
[0:51:23] <ColRedyx> You have arms on top also inserting.  You can remove those and make an output belt.
[0:51:26] <+patel347> automate removal of plates
[0:51:27] <cochramd1992> need gun?
[0:51:27] <+D00msDayDan> @Daxalog probably lol
[0:51:28] <munitalprats> Iron is big
[0:51:28] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> @Hommando inserters grab from both sides
[0:51:29] <%lumporr> use your coal dril
[0:51:31] <munitalprats> need i r o n
[0:51:31] <%lumporr> one of em
[0:51:34] <DianaTheAscian> thats a lot of coal
[0:51:35] <%Monkeyweed21> move a coal drill over to iron
[0:51:35] <sirtommygunn> need more drill to feed many furnace
[0:51:37] <+croten> Hold ctrl to pick up things on the floor around you, like the coal on the belt
[0:51:38] <+patel347> reuse the coal drill
[0:51:40] <KShirahama> just take one from coal
[0:51:41] <+patel347> you dont need 2
[0:51:45] <%vivaldiva> build assemblers to make more drills to make more assemblers
[0:51:49] <$Hommando> @sashagreenspiderqueen is that new because that was not always the case
[0:51:52] <+patel347> you can replace it later
[0:51:52] <LVL1_Scumbag> Why not just cannibalize another drill?
[0:51:53] <%Monkeyweed21> YOU HAVE TOO MUCH COAL
[0:51:54] <%MelBrooksKA> Don't need two drills on coal
[0:51:56] <+D00msDayDan> you have a lot more coal available than you need right now
[0:51:57] <Fluffy_Tamamo> Is this just 'hardcore drugs' month for Pat? Mind goblins must be in rare form. snuffCalculated
[0:51:58] <JigsK> fair
[0:51:59] <+other_badger> based
[0:52:00] <@SoFarFetched> Guys calm down its STILL the tutorial.

[0:52:16] <%AncelDeLambert> NEVERRRRRR! *yoink*
[0:52:20] <LVL1_Scumbag> And the world didn't end
[0:52:24] <%Landralin1996> You're doing it!
[0:52:26] <Johannen> Paige sleeping in the background?
[0:52:26] <%Monkeyweed21> @lumporr you were saying
[0:52:27] <munitalprats> yeyeyeye!
[0:52:31] <munitalprats> He's beginning to believe!
[0:52:32] <sirtommygunn> pat wait power generation in this is much more forgiving than satisfactory, your machines just slow down rather than shutting down all at once
[0:52:33] <+patel347> does he have splitters?
[0:52:34] <+Ritsu_sohma> Pat you can hold down click to space them out automatically for powerlines
[0:52:43] <darkjiku> you can drag place conveyer belts
[0:52:43] <%lumporr> @Monkeyweed21 what was i saying
[0:52:45] <+Slushsoup> You can feed coal into steam engine for infinite power
[0:52:48] <munitalprats> splitters is a research item @patel347
[0:52:49] <+b_aleph> eeeeewww
[0:52:49] <iosephe> insects do not care
[0:52:50] <%MelBrooksKA> @patel347 no
[0:52:51] <LVL1_Scumbag> Work faster
[0:52:53] <+patel347> splitter pat
[0:52:53] <@SoFarFetched> literally calm down,hes taking his baby steps.
[0:52:54] <RyuuAoi> What spawns them?
[0:52:54] <+meisnewbie> also pro tip, pressing q over ore automatically puts the highest level miner onto your cursor (anything else is just a copy of the thing you're hovering over)
[0:52:54] <BwdYeti> Mouse wheel to zoom, if you need to see more of the map at once
[0:52:55] <%holydeviant1> GODDAMN BUGS
[0:52:58] <%SilvaChariot0133> "Is that all ya got ya slippery shit!?"
[0:53:00] <+b_aleph> your factory has disgusting bugs
[0:53:02] <amiavamp> Anti mind goblin feature: if buildings get destroyed by bugs, the buildibgs leave behind ghosts so you can see where to rebuild.
[0:53:03] <+b_aleph> it's gross
[0:53:03] <+Ritsu_sohma> splitters are a reserched thing so no
[0:53:03] <buerdo> Whoa pat made it a past the box conundrum
[0:53:05] <%Arancet> buuuugs! quit ruining my factoryyyyy!
[0:53:06] <+meisnewbie> yessss
[0:53:10] <%holydeviant1> @RyuuAoi bug bases
[0:53:12] <%blastyoboots> Hold down click to auto space power lines at max travel distance
[0:53:21] <+D00msDayDan> @amiavamp that's not until you unlock construction bots
[0:53:23] <Sunstalker> SoFarFetched But pat is always taking baby steps? kinamaGasp
[0:53:24] <ShadeTheNovice> god the moment when you have the military power to obliterate the bugs is such a good moment
[0:53:25] <ColRedyx> If you hold down the mouse button when placing a power pole and drag it (or run with it held) it will only place new poles when you reach the end of your existing poles' range.
[0:53:26] <munitalprats> yes!
[0:53:30] <+b_aleph> Where's the sanitary inspector when you need him?
[0:53:32] <munitalprats> and then just connect em'
[0:53:34] <RyuuAoi> @holydeviant1 They just want a piece of the pie or?
[0:53:35] <%holydeviant1> YES
[0:53:39] <munitalprats> dont even need an inserter
[0:53:40] <themountaindwarf> hows everyone
[0:53:42] <@SoFarFetched> @Sunstalker big stompy baby steps Kappa
[0:53:43] <%lumporr> no need for inserter
[0:53:45] <KShirahama> no
[0:53:45] <+patel347> no you cant
[0:53:48] <+croten> You don't need an inserter
[0:53:49] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> inserter will put it on the far end
[0:53:50] <+gespenst25> Just use a belt
[0:53:50] <munitalprats> you can just have it convey
[0:53:51] <+patel347> it puts opasite side
[0:53:52] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt What if you moved the drill closer to the right?
[0:53:53] <munitalprats> you dont need insert
[0:53:55] <Tisaric> you don't need the inserter
[0:53:56] <%holydeviant1> @RyuuAoi factories make smoke and smog and bugs haet these things
[0:53:57] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> another belt will put it on the near end
[0:53:57] <+patel347> you cant use inserter
[0:53:58] <+Ritsu_sohma> No bad
[0:53:58] <+D00msDayDan> inserter's trying to put it on the same side of the belt
[0:53:58] <+b_aleph> uuuuuh
[0:53:59] <+croten> No that wont work right
[0:54:00] <+Zeplin666> no inserter, just belts
[0:54:00] <%Daxalog> Just use a belt
[0:54:00] <RyuuAoi> @themountaindwarf #drinKing
[0:54:01] <+thegreenbenis> Putting it on wrong side.
[0:54:02] <%vivaldiva> oh no, the goblins
[0:54:02] <BwdYeti> That won't work, the lines will backlog because you're using one lane
[0:54:02] <+patel347> because of offsset
[0:54:03] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> inserters feed to the far end
[0:54:05] <%Landralin1996> Inserters always put it on the other side of the belt, that won't work
[0:54:07] <%Tuna_Can_0> lol
[0:54:08] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> hes mixing lines NotLikeThis
[0:54:09] <+b_aleph> I don't think it's working
[0:54:09] <+thegreenbenis> @PatStaresAt No inserter pat.
[0:54:10] <ColRedyx> Inserters can pick up from either lane but they only place objects on the lane further away from them.
[0:54:11] <+Ritsu_sohma> Coal go to wrong side because arm puts on far side of belt
[0:54:12] <munitalprats> spaghetti
[0:54:12] <hardin360> Just run the conveyor to it.
[0:54:16] <buerdo> Bad
[0:54:17] <+croten> That inserter is putting the coal onto the wrong side of the belt
[0:54:17] <GustauveVIII> @patstaresat your coal is corrupting your iron line.
[0:54:20] <ColRedyx> If you want to put objects int he closer lane, just connect the belts.
[0:54:22] <+patel347> @PatStaresAt inserter wont work there becuase of offset
[0:54:22] <Tisaric> @PatStaresAt just use a belt instead of the inserter so the coal goes on the other side of the iron belt
[0:54:23] <%gear1033> Pat you dont need an arm if i gos into the other belt
[0:54:23] <+thegreenbenis> You don't need the inserter there pat. @PatStaresAt
[0:54:24] <%holydeviant1> (also the bigger the factory gets the more the bugs mutate and evolve)
[0:54:26] <+Slushsoup> The belts can feed into other belts from the side. No inserter needed
[0:54:27] <%lumporr> remove inserter noo
[0:54:27] <%Dunmarkh> spray bottle
[0:54:28] <DianaTheAscian> this seems super wrong
[0:54:29] <%metalicblackcherry> okish idea bad setup
[0:54:30] <%lumporr> remove inserter
[0:54:31] <munitalprats> remove arm
[0:54:32] <munitalprats> put belt
[0:54:35] <munitalprats> you need a LOT of iron
[0:54:36] <CrimsonFox777> L A M P
[0:54:37] <%tebari> Need to smelt iron
[0:54:38] <%DiscoMatador> Need plates
[0:54:39] <%Landralin1996> Iron Plates ;)
[0:54:39] <+InvertableQuasar> You can't smelt it manually
[0:54:39] <munitalprats> Iron is way more important than copper
[0:54:44] <munitalprats> ye!
[0:54:45] <%Monkeyweed21> plates
[0:54:46] <+patel347> yyeyeyeyee
[0:54:47] <+b_aleph> YOU CAN RIDE THE CONVEYOR BELT?

[0:54:54] <KShirahama> yes
[0:54:54] <+b_aleph> THAT GAME IS FUCKING SICK!
[0:54:54] <%lumporr> yeay
[0:54:55] <+gespenst25> He's learnding
[0:54:57] <ColRedyx> @PatStaresAt Inserters can grab from either land but they only place objects on the lane farther away from them.  To put objects on the closer lane, just connect the belts.
[0:54:59] <+thegreenbenis> Thank you.
[0:54:59] <%MelBrooksKA> Need to cook i-ron

[0:55:20] <%Infernal_Dalek> @b_aleph Yeah but it's slow; more often than not they annoy you so it's harder to place stuff, lol. There's a suit upgrade that negates this.

[0:59:19] <+ReallyBigRocks> There's a way to zoom out right?
[0:59:19] <+D00msDayDan> the belt shape changed
[0:59:20] <Orenjevel> eventually you optimise the combat out of the game
[0:59:21] <+other_badger> that side of the belt is full
[0:59:22] <theKingRamses> wrong side belt
[0:59:23] <$valkuma> belt full
[0:59:24] <BwdYeti> The side of the belt your items are on matters a lot
[0:59:26] <%blastyoboots> @T_Sasquatch the biters don't usually start this aggressive in a freeplay round
[0:59:31] <RyuuAoi> U broke it
[0:59:34] <%BoxNavy> WAIT WAIT WHOA WHOA
[0:59:35] <%DiscoMatador> Oh dear
[0:59:36] <0range_> 2 sides on a belt
[0:59:36] <%blastyoboots> @T_Sasquatch and you have a gun
[0:59:37] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt You can modify the iron line with more belts to move the coal to your desired lane.
[0:59:38] <snivins> make a T
[0:59:38] <sirtommygunn> you curved da belt by putting a belt on its left
[0:59:39] <%metalicblackcherry> belt shape bad
[0:59:40] <+InvertableQuasar> Yeah belt sides can be finicky
[0:59:40] <+derrigible> build an inserter to put the coal onto that belt so the coal and iron can be on different sides
[0:59:40] <munitalprats> wrong side of the belt
[0:59:40] <+croten> you need a T shape
[0:59:41] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt no power?
[0:59:43] <%DrBunni> the side of the belt
[0:59:43] <theKingRamses> too many coals
[0:59:44] <%Daxalog> The belt is covered in coal
[0:59:44] <+Ritsu_sohma> It fills the the closeest
[0:59:45] <iosephe> double coal belt
[0:59:45] <%Broand> You can press F to pick stuff from the belt btw
[0:59:48] <%holydeviant1> BELT FULL
[0:59:48] <%psidefx> Wh-Iron?
[0:59:50] <$valkuma> Make a straight down belt and have iron feed left and coal feed right
[0:59:51] <Orenjevel> T intersection it up
[0:59:57] <+other_badger> how can this BE
[0:59:58] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Aim it at the left side of the belt, dude
[0:59:58] <%blastyoboots> Pat you must learn belt-side-FU
[1:00:00] <+robosqueeb> this kills the goblins
[1:00:01] <+croten> Iron enter from > T < Coal enter from
[1:00:01] <%tebari> Reverse the iron belt
[1:00:02] <%Landralin1996> Just play with the belts you'll get it :)
[1:00:03] <ColRedyx> @PatStaresAt When you connect belts at the end it makes a corner.    Don't connect them at the corner, connect the left belt partway down the middle belt.
[1:00:03] <Scorchfield> got to set it up so its on opposite sides of the belt
[1:00:06] <%Daxalog> Hes pannicking again
[1:00:09] <%furiousfurioso> T shape
[1:00:09] <%Tuna_Can_0> you can do it, I believe in you LUL
[1:00:11] <%Monkeyweed21> BELTS HAVE 2 SIDES
[1:00:12] <Orenjevel> Give each one a Down belt onto a horizontal belt
[1:00:15] <sirtommygunn> Have it join 1 down from the top
[1:00:16] <theKingRamses> u turn?
[1:00:16] <+DJReViveAll> if you make a belt going onto that other belt it will end up on the opposite side
[1:00:16] <Calek> you cry a little
[1:00:17] <+TheEvaFreak> pat make a T with the belts
[1:00:18] <%Daxalog> Just make it flow into the other side
[1:00:18] <+gespenst25> feed it in on that side
[1:00:18] <%Infernal_Dalek> put one belt to north, then one to west
[1:00:18] <%Dunmarkh> make a t shape
[1:00:19] <Gopher_Gold> smh
[1:00:19] <%lumporr> try having a single belt being fed from either direction
[1:00:20] <%holydeviant1> [zoom in on pat's brain] [windows error sound]
[1:00:20] <munitalprats> he understands the problem he doesnt know how to fix it
[1:00:21] <invalid_robin> @PatStaresAt You can loop it
[1:00:21] <%Dunmarkh> T
[1:00:23] <darkjiku> go left and then go back right?
[1:00:23] <$valkuma> make the belt right in front of the iron, a left-facing belt, and curve it around @PatStaresAt
[1:00:25] <%DrBunni> make a lower case t
[1:00:27] <%Daxalog> Join from the left
[1:00:28] <$realm_forge> pat’s brain is actively pulling processing power away from his speech centers
[1:00:28] <CrimsonFox777> Make the iron conveyor go to the left and curve back?
[1:00:29] <%blastyoboots> Pat use T shape
[1:00:30] <RyuuAoi> This is a boss battle
[1:00:30] <Scorchfield> arrange the belt differently
[1:00:31] <%hewlettfan96> BELTS have all loops as well
[1:00:31] <LVL1_Scumbag> By feeding into the other side of the belt
[1:00:38] <%Tuna_Can_0> Make loop da loops
[1:00:38] <ColRedyx> Now place the left belt one space down the middle belt.
[1:00:39] <+InvertableQuasar> Then join the second drill in one down from the top
[1:00:39] <Gopher_Gold> Q
[1:00:39] <+CreggaMonsta> dog snores
[1:00:40] <%blastyoboots> ANOTHER T
[1:00:41] <munitalprats> yeah! he fixed it!
[1:00:42] <%Landralin1996> Work good!
[1:00:43] <+other_badger> he do it
[1:00:43] <%Infernal_Dalek> There ya go
[1:00:44] <snivins> smart
[1:00:47] <tastehbread> remain calm
[1:00:47] <+b_aleph> that's a Y
[1:00:47] <%ChrisPlaysThing> a Y works
[1:00:48] <+thegreenbenis> Good enough
[1:00:48] <Zero_Jacks> Iron -> Middle <- Coal
[1:00:49] <@Velyndra> smol brain
[1:00:49] <Orenjevel> Iron fix!
[1:00:51] <%holydeviant1> eyeron
[1:00:51] <+meisnewbie> yeaaaah!!
[1:00:53] <LVL1_Scumbag> That works
[1:00:53] <%M4T1A5> belt hard
[1:00:53] <%MelBrooksKA> That works too
[1:00:53] <%Dunmarkh> psaUp
[1:00:54] <ShadeTheNovice> yeyeyeye
[1:00:56] <LoneFonte> now make mags
[1:00:59] <%DiscoMatador> You Require Additional Ammunition
[1:01:02] <+Ragnakawaii> "We are Smart, we are strong"
[1:01:02] <%Daxalog> BULLETS
[1:01:04] <+Zeplin666> it works
[1:01:05] <%Infernal_Dalek> Iron Plate output DOUBLED
[1:01:06] <+ReallyBigRocks> That's clearly a four

[1:04:03] <%Tuna_Can_0> B O O L E T
[1:04:05] <ShichiNoBushi> Use the X in the box to limit the inventory size if you don't want them to constantly fill the box to full.
[1:04:05] <Calek> don't protect bug shoot bug
[1:04:07] <%lumporr> you have lots of ore in your inventory
[1:04:07] <+sulf> you can also mouse scroll to zoom in or out a bit
[1:04:08] <LVL1_Scumbag> Protecc bug
[1:04:09] <%czeekytv> slow mode Pog
[1:04:11] <%Bt_Robot> Now make the Turret
[1:04:12] <Orenjevel> a gun with many boolet!
[1:04:14] <sailercartridge> minimap when
[1:04:16] <+ReallyBigRocks> Bugdar
[1:04:21] <+CuttleCrow> bulletball
[1:04:24] <munitalprats> must make bugdar
[1:04:34] <+DJReViveAll> some turrets eventually
[1:04:34] <Orenjevel> gotta find that bug birthing pit
[1:04:36] <%Treuan> We'll call it Mr. Radar
[1:04:39] <sirtommygunn> is that Gief snoring
[1:04:45] <munitalprats> now you are FACTORIO
[1:04:47] <+sulf> bullet good :)
[1:04:50] <%DiscoMatador> Real game is Better than this
[1:05:00] <DeltaPangaea> Gun is friend.
[1:05:01] <%DiscoMatador> Biters less bad
[1:05:09] <0range_> gun good
[1:05:16] <munitalprats> so pat on the bottom right corner right below where it says alt, there's a warning for when bug attack
[1:05:16] <+b_aleph> How does anyone sleep with that pigdog around?
[1:05:17] <%lumporr> pat if you're stressed, know that bugs aren't usually an issue in the free mode until you pollute significantly in my experience
[1:05:24] <+ReallyBigRocks> oh it's not bugdar
[1:05:24] <Orenjevel> Are there any fish in the water? You can snag them for healing itesms
[1:05:27] <cochramd1992> this looks like a flash game
[1:05:28] <%vivaldiva> can't wait until nukes are made
[1:05:30] <+thegreenbenis> Pat "dead bug" Boivin
[1:05:32] <%Infernal_Dalek> I'm surprised you can power that many radars with just one power plant
[1:05:38] <%BoxNavy> many gun...
[1:05:46] <sailercartridge> please turn on minimap in interface settings
[1:05:52] <%BoxNavy> he is just cavemanning out huh
[1:05:53] <%lumporr> put ore in furnace
[1:05:54] <%Monkeyweed21> no you dont
[1:05:55] <0range_> add more steam
[1:05:56] <munitalprats> turn on the minimap
[1:05:59] <+ReallyBigRocks> are you able to zoom out? see bug from further away?
[1:05:59] <%DiscoMatador> Hook steam engine into ass of other engine make more zap
[1:06:03] <%Tuna_Can_0> @lumporr until you get up to mega base time where you have a constant stream of them atpRtsuspectd
[1:06:06] <+croten> 1 boiler can power 2 generators IIRC
[1:06:08] <BwdYeti> Is it disabled for the tutorial?
[1:06:12] <%M4T1A5> looks to be on already
[1:06:14] <%Tuna_Can_0> its there
[1:06:16] <munitalprats> its actually super important
[1:06:16] <Calek> it's turned on but not for tutorial apparently
[1:06:17] <LVL1_Scumbag> not for tutorial noobs
[1:06:18] <%blastyoboots> I think you can fuel more than one steam engine with one boiler
[1:06:21] <%greasypete00> holy shit that dog is LOUD
[1:06:22] <%bevyrage> radars gives you minimap
[1:06:23] <%metalicblackcherry> its on
[1:06:24] <BliVru> use the grabbers to put things into boxes like right next of furnaces
[1:06:24] <%MelBrooksKA> @lumporr It also helps when you don't go "eh, I can bump the evolution up a bit. what's the worst that can happen"
[1:06:27] <%Daxalog> What about the top right buttons?
[1:06:29] <BoxNavy> Jebaited ?
[1:06:41] <+D00msDayDan> one boiler makes enough steam to feed two steam engines
[1:06:42] <%Monkeyweed21> you dont need more power
[1:06:43] <darkjiku> you dont neeed that much energy
[1:06:49] <munitalprats> now you have many bullet!
[1:07:04] <+sulf> cant wait for train signalling, lot of people gonna get perma'd for that stream :D :D :D
[1:07:05] <+meisnewbie> click on power pole if you want to see how much power you're using vs producing
[1:07:07] <+Zeplin666> a boiler can power 2 steam generators
[1:07:09] <munitalprats> nah you need more radars, this tutorial is long
[1:07:18] <BwdYeti> 1 boiler : 2 steam engines
[1:07:19] <reasonance> you have a bunch of iron ore in your bag that you could chuck in the furnaces
[1:07:20] <+b_aleph> much coal such wow
[1:07:26] <%Arweynn> make a few turrets
[1:07:29] <+JonWhoLovesFlatWomen> are ya winnin pat?
[1:07:33] <EvanDude47> click on any random powerline to check your grid
[1:07:34] <%blastyoboots> now just plonk on the end
[1:07:37] <munitalprats> he cant make turrets yet
[1:07:39] <Calek> @Zeplin666 is it really just two, because I've been running with 3 and it's been working just fine
[1:07:46] <%Dunmarkh> @Arweynn not an option
[1:07:47] <+ReallyBigRocks> yucky buggo
[1:07:48] <ColRedyx> @PatStaresAt You can connect steam engines end to end.
[1:07:49] <%DiscoMatador> Plug Steam engine to ass of other engine
[1:07:54] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> You can place the second boiler in line with the first, i believe
[1:07:57] <munitalprats> He needs to progress the tutorial guys
[1:07:57] <BwdYeti> You can put steam engines directly in a line with each other
[1:08:00] <%Arweynn> pipe hype
[1:08:00] <balthazar758> choo choo
[1:08:03] <%metalicblackcherry> steam in series
[1:08:04] <snivins> you can put it behind the other
[1:08:08] <Griffin1171> just put the engine directly after the first
[1:08:16] <%BoxNavy> piiiiipe
[1:08:18] <+meisnewbie> stronk pat
[1:08:19] <munitalprats> YES! more pollution! big evil1
[1:08:21] <Orenjevel> power 2!
[1:08:21] <%lumporr> you can put the excess ore in the furnaces now also
[1:08:22] <Scorchfield> pipes were not needed, could have placed at end of other engine
[1:08:28] <+sulf> 1 tip i think is really nice ot know, 1 boiler services 2 steam engines
[1:08:31] <%Tuna_Can_0> get fucked bugs atpLaw atpCop
[1:08:32] <tastehbread> you can human centipede the steam engines, yea
[1:08:32] <%blastyoboots> GATTAI
[1:08:36] <%Landralin1996> Yes! :)
[1:08:36] <%M4T1A5> you could probably also put the 90 iron ore into the furnaces from your inventory
[1:08:38] <%DiscoMatador> YEYEYEYEYE
[1:08:42] <%lumporr> YAY
[1:08:51] <%Infernal_Dalek> One boiler will support two power plants
[1:08:52] <%Daxalog> If you press M does it bring up a map?
[1:08:54] <+JonWhoLovesFlatWomen> hes doing it!

[1:08:58] <%BoxNavy> theres gotta be cool autoturrets you get later
[1:08:58] <Orenjevel> Take *that* nature!
[1:09:02] <Griffin1171> only 2 steam engines per boiler tho
[1:09:08] <+meisnewbie> note: a boiler produces exactly enough steam for two steam turbines
[1:09:13] <+PandaCavalry> I think its one boiler per 2 steam generators
[1:09:14] <+sulf> copper does sick till endgame tbh
[1:09:17] <%lumporr> extra ore in inventory
[1:09:23] <ISKMogul> Click power poles to seee power grid
[1:09:30] <munitalprats> yeah copper isnt nearly as needed as iron untill endgame
[1:09:31] <+croten> Like satisfactory you don't need nearly as much copper as you do Eye-ron
[1:09:39] <+Das_Prints> Are you able to do anything with the big corpses or do they just pile up?
[1:09:41] <%Bt_Robot> @BoxNavy Dude, there's lazer drones later
[1:09:47] <%blastyoboots> using half your capacity, that's good
[1:09:50] <ExpressNode> Pat Ship Troopers
[1:09:51] <Punchy_Brewster> I had my doubts listening to the podcast, but this actually looks legit fun
[1:09:58] <%Dunmarkh> @Das_Prints they just pile up massively
[1:10:01] <%BoxNavy> @BoxNavy nice...
[1:10:03] <snivins> pollute this world pat
[1:10:07] <munitalprats> Coal piled up
[1:10:11] <+DJReViveAll> you protecc but also attac
[1:10:12] <+sulf> he said the thing Pog
[1:10:18] <%BoxNavy> spray raid on them
[1:10:25] <0range_> yes
[1:10:26] <Orenjevel> The best automatic turret is a high speed train
[1:10:27] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> You have machines making radars, yes
[1:10:29] <slycoopertwooneseven> well, I know what I'm doing tomorrow
[1:10:29] <LVL1_Scumbag> ye
[1:10:30] <+croten> Yup, that's what assemblers are for
[1:10:32] <+sulf> 100% correct about components
[1:10:33] <munitalprats> yeah you have machines making components to bring them to more machines that make the thing
[1:10:34] <%Bt_Robot> Soon this world will be covered in concrete
[1:10:35] <%ironohki> I might play this.
[1:10:35] <%vivaldiva> assemblers. assemblers everywhere
[1:10:37] <%Treuan> Too ret
[1:10:38] <+InvertableQuasar> Eventually you have machines make the components and the end products
[1:10:41] <%blastyoboots> YES AUTOMATE THE SHOOTING
[1:10:41] <sirtommygunn> in the long run the machines make everything
[1:10:43] <ColRedyx> Need more iron
[1:10:44] <Psyramics> you  an have mahchines make the radars too
[1:10:44] <%Infernal_Dalek> I enjoy looking at the map sometimes with M just to watch the radars work.
[1:10:47] <LoneFonte> now just stay alive
[1:10:49] <PinoProxie> such a sleepy boi
[1:10:49] <+b_aleph> do it coward
[1:10:51] <GunEden> ideally you will automate everything
[1:10:53] <%lumporr> put directly into furnace
[1:10:55] <%Ironbuttz> so much doggie snores
[1:10:58] <Orenjevel> many iron for gun that shoots itself
[1:11:00] <+Das_Prints> @dunmarkh amazing.
[1:11:01] <+ReallyBigRocks> you even automate gun
[1:11:04] <%lumporr> directly into furnace
[1:11:07] <munitalprats> iron production good
[1:11:19] <mattynezz> Feed gun turrets with ammo production, because it will be be a pain if you don't
[1:11:20] <sirtommygunn> There's an achievement for only crafting like 100 items by hand and beating the game
[1:11:24] <Orenjevel> fuck, now i want to play factorio again
[1:11:26] <%the22cstomp> so many dead damn beetles
[1:11:30] <%ironohki> Are dead bugs ever a material?
[1:11:38] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> There might be a nest immediately north of you, spawning dudes
[1:11:40] <+Robo_BootyxXx> how bad are the mind goblins in this?
[1:11:41] <munitalprats> Yes! more pollution!
[1:11:42] <%Arweynn> make gun turrets
[1:11:42] <%Dunmarkh> @ironohki nope
[1:11:42] <ExpressNode> You'd think they'd learn after the other dozen bug corpses
[1:11:43] <+croten> The factory must grow
[1:11:46] <%MelBrooksKA> @ironohki no
[1:11:51] <PinoProxie> this starcraft mod is neat
[1:11:52] <%ChestMimik> @ironohki Not in vanilla
[1:11:53] <amiavamp> Dead bug nests used to be a material in an old version but they changed it
[1:11:56] <%DiscoMatador> Its Growing.........My Factory
[1:11:56] <Orenjevel> put turrets next to birthing pits to cover your assault
[1:11:59] <%blastyoboots> @ironohki i think you get stuff from the bug SPAWNERS but not the bugs themselves
[1:12:05] <%Teyaric> They DO learn. They actually evolve. Dangerously.
[1:12:06] <Calek> @Robo_BootyxXx I've restarted the game like 5 times because I keep walled with how much I hate my unoptimized set up
[1:12:06] <%ironohki> Boo. So much bug just sitting around, unusable.
[1:12:09] <+Romuken> Hi @PatStaresAt I'm watching your Pillars of Eternity playthrough right now, but was wondering if I need to watch it for context for PoE2?
[1:12:25] <amiavamp> Destroying bug nests just makes bugs stronger
[1:12:26] <%lumporr> YESS
[1:12:28] <%MelBrooksKA> I don't think you have machinegun turrets in this tutorial
[1:12:28] <%lumporr> YEAAAHHHHHH
[1:12:30] <%Dunmarkh> yes
[1:12:31] <+InvertableQuasar> He's doing it!
[1:12:32] <snivins> too smart
[1:12:32] <%blastyoboots> YES!!!!!
[1:12:33] <BwdYeti> The bug spawners used to drop things, but not anymore
[1:12:37] <munitalprats> YEAAAAH
[1:12:44] <%lumporr> YEAAAAAAAA
[1:12:45] <+meisnewbie> @blastyoboots that's been patched out, it's not longer a science requirement, although I think krastorio2 has a spawner based resource
[1:12:48] <%Teyaric> IT BEGINNNNNS
[1:12:48] <+Rockbeards> He's learning!
[1:12:50] <sirtommygunn> you can see the exact moment Pat's brain grows
[1:12:54] <sweetestbeefs> just got here, why is chat on slow mode?
[1:12:56] <BwdYeti> pat brain growing
[1:12:58] <TheDr0t> He's beggining to BELIEVE
[1:12:58] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[1:13:00] <munitalprats> do not need box!
[1:13:01] <Orenjevel> ooooo hes doing it
[1:13:02] <%lumporr> every ten minutes is the monkey throwing the stick in the air from 2001 a space oddysey
[1:13:08] <+b_aleph> why the crate?
[1:13:11] <%DiscoMatador> Begone BOX
[1:13:13] <+sulf> he's beginning to expand his M I N D
[1:13:17] <%lumporr> no box
[1:13:18] <BwdYeti> Right click to craft 5
[1:13:21] <BliVru> You are now ready for compettitive multiplayer
[1:13:24] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Right click a recipe to build multiple
[1:13:26] <Orenjevel> box is too thick
[1:13:30] <%blastyoboots> @PatStaresAt if you right click a recipe you can craft 5 at a time
[1:13:38] <amiavamp> 1 furnace is missing an inserter
[1:13:43] <%ChestMimik> Is the crate supposed to have an inserter in front?
[1:13:43] <hardin360> Unless something's changed you cant feed a  crate directly from a belt.
[1:13:52] <munitalprats> it doesnt need a box
[1:13:56] <+croten> It doesnt
[1:13:57] <%lumporr> yes
[1:13:59] <amiavamp> Put it to the side so you can send the belt elsewhere
[1:13:59] <mattynezz> No
[1:14:02] <snivins> are you making a buffer?
[1:14:03] <LVL1_Scumbag> Does it?
[1:14:03] <darkjiku> feed it directly into the assembler
[1:14:06] <%DiscoMatador> Straight into M A C H I N E
[1:14:06] <ColRedyx> Second furnace is missing an output arm.
[1:14:07] <+thegreenbenis> Why does it have to go into a box? @PatStaresAt
[1:14:18] <%metalicblackcherry> pat likes his boxes guys
[1:14:21] <mattynezz> Straight into assembler
[1:14:21] <%TheDullaMAN> You missed one of the furnaces
[1:14:23] <huskarl_zap> driller go kaboom
[1:14:24] <%ChestMimik> No walls yet?
[1:14:26] <munitalprats> put assembly on other side so that you can keep line going soemhwere else
[1:14:29] <%MelBrooksKA> I think he wants a buffer for himself
[1:14:31] <%Arweynn> MAKE. TURRETS.
[1:14:32] <%blastyoboots> @PatStaresAt if one inserter is too slow for box you can loop inserters around it in a circle
[1:14:33] <+thegreenbenis> Build a turret
[1:14:34] <+Romuken> Map is fren
[1:14:36] <+D00msDayDan> FINALLY REPAIR PACKS
[1:14:38] <%caramelatte1> This looks very frustraiting
[1:14:39] <EvanDude47> you need a turret up there
[1:14:40] <snivins> thats ok for rare components not so much for iron but is ok as a buffer
[1:14:41] <%MelBrooksKA> @ChestMimik Not in this tutorial
[1:14:43] <+Goblinz_3> Walls are for cowards
[1:14:44] <+JonWhoLovesFlatWomen> this tutorial is weird
[1:14:45] <%Dunmarkh> you should really build those turrets pat
[1:14:45] <Scorchfield> probably want to build some turrets to defend things for you
[1:14:50] <Orenjevel> Repair pack unlocked?
[1:14:51] <munitalprats> dont need box
[1:14:53] <mige_> please make a turret
[1:14:56] <%lumporr> second furnace
[1:14:59] <%BoxNavy> 🚫 🪲 🚫
[1:14:59] <BwdYeti> Does M bring up the fullscreen map in the tutorial?
[1:15:00] <cochramd1992> the turrets though
[1:15:03] <%ChestMimik> @MelBrooksKA Missed that it's the tutorial
[1:15:08] <spongeofmystery> Jesus Christ that dog is loud
[1:15:08] <Calek> big snores
[1:15:09] <amiavamp> box is good so he can loot iron for himself
[1:15:14] <+sulf> press M to open ur map
[1:15:14] <+other_badger> isn't it iornic
[1:15:18] <snivins> make the turret
[1:15:37] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Q is pipette/clone tool, like middle click in Satisfactory
[1:15:39] <+thegreenbenis> Turrets might help.
[1:15:40] <darkjiku> boolet tooret?
[1:15:41] <%lumporr> how we doing pat
[1:15:43] <dapperskeleton69> dog do be snoozin doe
[1:15:43] <PassBand> Is that noise the super evil bugs that will eventually kill pat, or just Zangief?
[1:15:51] <%DiscoMatador> Make Machine to Shoot Bugs
[1:15:52] <munitalprats> BIG iron
[1:15:53] <mattynezz> It's a small thing now, but important for later. You don't need that box, you can feed directly into manufacturing buldings
[1:15:57] <+Romuken> @other_badger sir, this is an applebees.  please leave.
[1:15:59] <DeltaPangaea> Wait is that actually just Gief wheezing
[1:16:01] <ColRedyx> 2nd furnace from the top has no output arm.
[1:16:09] <BliVru> turret needs ammo
[1:16:13] <sirtommygunn> It's Gief snoring
[1:16:17] <%Infernal_Dalek> Build more radars to meet that qouta sooner
[1:16:19] <%BoxNavy> make gun...
[1:16:21] <munitalprats> turret does take ammo
[1:16:30] <+sulf> turret ammo feeding is such a pain in the butt early on
[1:16:31] <%poohtrailsnailcooch> poohtrailsnailcooch subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 27 months! Random question but do you have fond memories of God of war 4 and are you excited for Ragnarok? I recently found that a good amount fans did not like it.
[1:16:32] <%blastyoboots> OH MY GOD I THOUGHT IT WAS A FACTORY GROAN BUT IT WAS GIEF ZNORE
[1:16:32] <+Romuken> @other_badger but for real, dont leave cause that was funny XD
[1:16:33] <BwdYeti> A turret is just a big gun
[1:16:37] <+thegreenbenis> Gief sounds like a Silent Hill monster.
[1:16:40] <amiavamp> Turret doesn't require power but does require ammo
[1:16:40] <+b_aleph> make moar radars! moar!
[1:16:41] <munitalprats> does not need power

[1:18:10] <%BoxNavy> gun?!?
[1:18:11] <%Tuna_Can_0> atpRtsd pats PTSD is kicking in
[1:18:11] <Orenjevel> Gunx4
[1:18:13] <+meisnewbie> i hear if you build a bunch next to the water you get a gun dam
[1:18:14] <sirtommygunn> Need a dispenser here!
[1:18:16] <Flakari> Have a belt that feeds bullets to gun
[1:18:19] <+thegreenbenis> Recommend run ammo automatically to gun.
[1:18:22] <Scorchfield> imagine walls with guns behind them and belts full of ammo behind them being fed by a ammo factory
[1:18:23] <%MelBrooksKA> Gun?
[1:18:23] <+Das_Prints> If they don’t work, use more gun.
[1:18:24] <dapperskeleton69> he is begunning to gunlieve

[1:18:34] <%lumporr> is there a way to clean up the bodies?
[1:18:36] <%Solarint> ???
[1:18:37] <%Infernal_Dalek> You can use Z to insert ammo into turrets a lil easier
[1:18:45] <%vivaldiva> psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin
[1:18:48] <snivins> not yet
[1:18:49] <munitalprats> gotta go around
[1:18:49] <%lumporr> until later
[1:18:50] <%ChestMimik> @lumporr Build over them
[1:18:51] <KShirahama> for now yes
[1:18:52] <%Dunmarkh> for now yes
[1:18:53] <%DiscoMatador> Not yet my boy
[1:18:56] <LoneFonte> for now
[1:18:57] <%lumporr> but also, you could run your iron backwards
[1:18:58] <%scallycap> yes...........YES.......
[1:18:58] <%bevyrage> start the belt above it to save on belts
[1:19:00] <+b_aleph> can't you go above?
[1:19:09] <%Mrbaconator> so begins the spaghetti
[1:19:09] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> You could make your steel plate output aim up in the first place
[1:19:10] <%vivaldiva> oh no, the belt nightmare has begun!
[1:19:12] <BliVru> outside tutorial you can research more stuff
[1:19:16] <+sulf> honestly pat is getting it a lot faster than i did, satisfactory training paid off
[1:19:17] <amiavamp> Game is much harder without the first few techs that let you manipulate belts in different ways
[1:19:19] <Flakari> yeeeeah

[1:19:23] <h8t0r_m4rs> YEAH

[1:19:39] <sirtommygunn> Tree?
[1:19:40] <%DiscoMatador> Gun doesn't care about tree
[1:19:40] <munitalprats> turrets dont need power
[1:19:43] <%lumporr> but the inserters will
[1:19:48] <%DiscoMatador> ammo arm
[1:19:52] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt I think the belts are one space lower than they should be.
[1:19:52] <%Tuna_Can_0> its one tile off NotLikeThis
[1:19:53] <+thegreenbenis> Doesn't need power just hate.
[1:20:01] <munitalprats> Turrets are powered by spite
[1:20:06] <+sulf> just as u were getting into it :(
[1:20:08] <%blastyoboots> oh i completely forgot shift clicking craft builds all you can of an item

[1:20:16] <%bevyrage> pocket that strat for when you play the game for real then

[1:20:21] <munitalprats> YES IT WOULD HAVE WORKED!
[1:20:21] <+InvertableQuasar> Yup, you had it exactly!

[1:20:29] <PassBand> Yes Pat, KILL THEM ALL
[1:20:29] <mattynezz> It would have loaded unevenly, but yes
[1:20:30] <%Monkeyweed21> 35 MIN on the tutorial LUL
[1:20:31] <%MelBrooksKA> Conveyor belts were off by one @PatStaresAt
[1:20:32] <ShadeTheNovice> yea
[1:20:36] <%Tuna_Can_0> its fine lol
[1:20:39] <dapperskeleton69> time for big peepee
[1:20:41] <LoneFonte> Victory pee!!!
[1:20:41] <%Tuna_Can_0> just meming
[1:20:42] <amiavamp> technically you can use long-handed inserters if you want to have the spite of not moving the belt one space lol
[1:20:52] <%BoxNavy> pee
[1:20:56] <%Bt_Robot> Now make gun to make more gun
[1:21:05] <mattynezz> He could have just moved the turrets
[1:21:09] <%lumporr> you guys ever just open your factorio files and admire them
[1:21:10] <RyuuAoi> Pat taking a shot
[1:21:12] <%Tuna_Can_0> stuff 1 tile off just need extendo arms anyway
[1:21:17] <munitalprats> yeah he could have just moved the turrets
[1:21:18] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Jank jonk is so nice
[1:21:28] <skyentombment> Yo, I got an ad for lactacyd that opened, no joke , with "I AM YOUR VAGINA, THE PURVEYOR OF PASSION"
[1:21:38] <%Bt_Robot> Gun that shoots gun machine, and the machine makes more gun, also it is powered by trains
[1:21:52] <%BoxNavy> gun...
[1:21:57] <amiavamp> Factory powered by spin of gun barrels
[1:22:08] <+meisnewbie> the factorio subreddit gets a "first factory" like every week or so and every time the subreddit loves how spaghetti it is
[1:22:09] <RyuuAoi> Bs, sky
[1:22:15] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Man stocks are so surreal, if things work out as i think they will i'' have $5.5M in 3 years
[1:22:18] <1matheuw> are ya winning pat?
[1:22:25] <ShadeTheNovice> @lumporr I cant bear to look at them for fear of being pulled back in
[1:22:30] <%Blazymaniac> this brb animation is soo flashy
[1:22:34] <marvel877> What I miss?
[1:22:36] <%ChrisPlaysThing> banana shit
[1:22:42] <+TheWe4pon> hey im late, how is Pat handling the game today?
[1:22:48] <%Bt_Robot> GUN
[1:22:54] <amiavamp> Locked in battle with his goblins
[1:22:55] <%blastyoboots> @ChrisPlaysThing i have a bridge to sell you ;)
[1:23:08] <skyentombment> @TheWe4pon He was stuck in the tutorial for the first hr
[1:23:11] <marvel877> Why slow mode?
[1:23:13] <%ChrisPlaysThing> @blastyoboots LUL
[1:23:17] <RyuuAoi> He aint dead yet
[1:23:44] <RyuuAoi> My OCD thru the roof doe
[1:23:53] <marvel877> How long SHOULD it take on average for the tutorial?
[1:23:59] <+sulf> @TheWe4pon 3rd tutorial finished, doing well
[1:24:11] <%Tuna_Can_0> anywhere from 1 - 20 hrs
[1:24:16] <skyentombment> @RyuuAoi dude, I'm not exaggerating, they had orgasm moans playing at a point
[1:24:20] <amiavamp> At least in Factorio you can just build more things to put into more things instead of having the optimal production displayed right in your face as Satisfactory does it
[1:24:26] <%GeneralSCPatton> This is such a banger, and the animation is so enthralling
[1:24:33] <Ell1ot> I got my first shot yesterday. all the old people gave me the stink eye.
[1:24:37] <dapperskeleton69> CE LA REE
[1:24:38] <%greasypete00> sellery

[1:25:17] <snivins> nah
[1:25:18] <amiavamp> It's a fancier version
[1:25:18] <%Dunmarkh> fuck this part of the tutorial, I quit it here and went to the main game
[1:25:19] <+sulf> nah :)
[1:25:19] <+Ritsu_sohma> no
[1:25:20] <%Daxalog> Nope!
[1:25:22] <%lumporr> this is an example of what you do eventually
[1:25:23] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Just need a spring onion in the butt to make you healthy Kappa
[1:25:24] <+MillerLowlife> misophonia is fun

[1:25:43] <+ニっディアン> Long boys.
[1:25:45] <ColRedyx> Look at how they make T's with their belts.
[1:25:46] <munitalprats> game did a big timelapse, you have more stuff researched
[1:25:46] <amiavamp> wtf I have never had to transfer between walls lol
[1:25:48] <sirtommygunn> if the tutorial gets too difficult just quit and do freeplay, you can learn at your own pace there
[1:25:51] <%lumporr> it is not
[1:25:52] <%Daxalog> Yeah. But its LONGER
[1:25:54] <%Broand> but its LONG
[1:25:56] <GustauveVIII> Longboys are faster
[1:25:59] <mattynezz> Range
[1:25:59] <EvanDude47> 2 space item transfers
[1:25:59] <A0N33> It's the same thing just L O N G
[1:26:00] <+croten> Long inserters can reach further
[1:26:01] <%ChrisPlaysThing> similar, but underground
[1:26:01] <%DiscoMatador> LONG
[1:26:02] <+SLaSZT> been checking out this game for a while but haven't bit the bullet since it seems like it gets boring over time
[1:26:02] <%holydeviant1> looooong
[1:26:04] <Flakari> Between walls is...interesting
[1:26:05] <%Ranryu692> why is chat in slow mode, wtf did you idiots do LUL
[1:26:06] <%primarch_lupercal> first thing i tune into is him eating celery nice
[1:26:08] <ColRedyx> It's the same but it reaches farther.  You can load or unload from two belts side-by-side with long and short arms.
[1:26:08] <dapperskeleton69> loooong loooong maaaaaaaan!
[1:26:10] <%blastyoboots> that's not what she said
[1:26:11] <doster504> wait why would you go around walls and not under them
[1:26:11] <%BoxNavy> long...
[1:26:11] <amiavamp> Long inserters are faster too btw
[1:26:13] <%Monkeyweed21> LONG LONG HAAAAAANDDD
[1:26:14] <ShadeTheNovice> they reach from 2 tiles away
[1:26:18] <skrewarrior> you can input 2 belts into one machine from one side
[1:26:22] <cochramd1992> @Vestillion it has very low calories and takes a lot of energy to digest, but it's good for roughage
[1:26:26] <+sulf> TRAINS POG
[1:26:27] <ItIsSky> long arms do help with organization

[1:26:37] <%Dunmarkh> god fuck this weird factory that the player doesn't build

[1:27:10] <darkjiku> oh boy labs, welcome to potion hell
[1:27:13] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Since they can reach over walls, you can set u more protection for your factory without interfering with production
[1:27:14] <%blistexthief> Red means bring gun
[1:27:15] <mattynezz> Ah yes, I too have never played a video game
[1:27:16] <+b_aleph> well, the blue is clearly land

[1:28:55] <+Sleepy_Puma> That dog SHLEEP
[1:28:56] <Expendamech> might want to restock that ammo for turrets first @PatStaresAt
[1:28:59] <@SoFarFetched> Gief is just ASMR Kappa
[1:29:01] <amiavamp> don't worry, as long as you have GUN you can pretty much go at your own pace in the early game (assuming the tutorial doesn't try to fuck you over??)
[1:29:02] <$Dakuu75> I NEED MORE POWER~!
[1:29:02] <mattmmkay> it's realy loud
[1:29:03] <%BoxNavy> a
[1:29:04] <%lumporr> is pat putting anything on his celery or is he just eating plain celery
[1:29:09] <%ChestMimik> Pat knows more power means the biters attack sooner, right?
[1:29:09] <+Javaa01> Gotta start on those turrets soon
[1:29:14] <snivins> Member you can press Alt so it shows like before
[1:29:17] <%lumporr> fair

[1:29:33] <Orenjevel> fuck yeah plain celery
[1:29:39] <+PenmanLupine> you ever eat a celery and an apple at the same time? It'll change your world man.
[1:29:48] <%blastyoboots> @ChestMimik power isn't wasted, just because he has more power production doesn't mean it's consumed faster so the pollution is still the same
[1:29:49] <$Dakuu75> @PatStaresAt What's that shirt your wearing?
[1:29:52] <mattmmkay> I should eat more celery or something equally as cronch
[1:29:52] <@SoFarFetched> I assume gief is possibly sleeping on the couch

[1:31:09] <BliVru> Put an insterter to take ammo from the factory into the box cuz it maxes at 2
[1:31:11] <%blastyoboots> you can inserter into box or just fill box with bullets
[1:31:12] <Scorchfield> you passed 2 on the left there as well
[1:31:15] <%BoxNavy> make 100 gun

[1:32:08] <+sulf> it will stop at 10 magazines per turret
[1:32:09] <mattmmkay> they do ride big gungun balls don'tthey?

[1:32:17] <Griffin1171> add iron mino
[1:32:27] <dapperskeleton69> yknow what i mean?
[1:32:31] <mattmmkay> or am I thinking of something else
[1:32:32] <ISKMogul> You can put up to 200 in a gun, but no need
[1:32:34] <%DiscoMatador> Nah just not enough gun supply
[1:32:40] <%lumporr> you can stuff em with more than 10 but inserters usually leave a lot of capacity i find
[1:32:41] <ItIsSky> I love how wild this game gets
[1:32:48] <dapperskeleton69> needs more gungas
[1:32:51] <Expendamech> @PatStaresAt inserters cap at 10, storage can fit 1 stack of 200

[1:34:18] <ColRedyx> Not underground, pole was in the way.
[1:34:21] <ergulor> there's a pole in the middle
[1:34:22] <slycoopertwooneseven> not underground
[1:34:23] <%Monkeyweed21> lol pat cant read
[1:34:36] <munitalprats> remove box and 2 inserters
[1:34:40] <ColRedyx> You could also just insert into the box and the box will feed the guns.
[1:34:43] <amiavamp> It auto-places underground belts I assume? dunno when that was added
[1:34:49] <%Dunmarkh> kill the natives
[1:34:56] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt Missing power lines to the bottom.
[1:34:56] <%Tuna_Can_0> genius iq engineer
[1:35:07] <+Danofthetubes> PERFECT
[1:35:11] <munitalprats> remove box and 2 inserters
[1:35:12] <%Daxalog> Time for lab
[1:35:13] <+sulf> your perimeter is now secure
[1:35:14] <amiavamp> Stone mine there if you want walls
[1:35:14] <Calek> ayyyy sexy lady~
[1:35:15] <mattmmkay> there aren't enough guns
[1:35:17] <%bevyrage> oh shit there's fish in the water
[1:35:17] <Griffin1171> fish
[1:35:23] <+Javaa01> Wouldn't it make more sense to feed straight into the box?
[1:35:24] <%DiscoMatador> Perfection
[1:35:25] <+Romuken> dont tell him
[1:35:25] <duuupes> nicely gun
[1:35:28] <sirtommygunn> base secured
[1:35:29] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Lab time.
[1:35:34] <mormond13> mormond13 subscribed with Prime. 
[1:35:34] <%Tuna_Can_0> fishy :)
[1:35:40] <LVL1_Scumbag> But what if?
[1:35:44] <munitalprats> lab first
[1:35:44] <rafaelba93> lab?
[1:35:47] <amiavamp> @Javaa01 takes more inserters that way
[1:35:56] <BigBadWaffle> Oh so you went from Satisfactory to this? What are your thoughts about the game? @patstaresat
[1:36:02] <+Javaa01> I suppose
[1:36:06] <mattmmkay> make gun make gun
[1:36:08] <amiavamp> @Javaa01 the ammo can just sit on the belt if you don't need a buffer or a place to store the items for your own use
[1:36:10] <munitalprats> ided make a lab first just so you can see your next objective
[1:36:19] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Focus on the tutorial objectives
[1:36:24] <s1rcuit> don't worry about it
[1:36:27] <%BoxNavy> s t o n e
[1:36:28] <EvanDude47> it had coal at spawn
[1:36:30] <penndrachen> itself
[1:36:34] <+Romuken> Gun!  Gun?  Gun-stone.  Stooooone.  Stone Gun?  Gun.  Stone.  COAL?!
[1:36:56] <Calek> but babaaaaa
[1:37:01] <munitalprats> labs are big important
[1:37:06] <sirtommygunn> time to start science
[1:37:08] <+sulf> oh boy labs are gonna take a minte
[1:37:09] <%Tuna_Can_0> Pat collect rocks atpCap
[1:37:11] <%Daxalog> Give it room
[1:37:14] <amiavamp> @Javaa01 though there is a mod for masochists that makes belts spill onto the floor if items reach the end, instead of backing up and stopping
[1:37:19] <LoneFonte> not really, but VERY important
[1:37:20] <LVL1_Scumbag> You have no idea
[1:37:21] <munitalprats> time for mind melt
[1:37:23] <bonebagMEL> Ok here is where the fucky wuckies begin
[1:37:25] <ShadeTheNovice> labs are huge important
[1:37:30] <%boxboten> boxboten subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months! rock good
[1:37:31] <+Romuken> gotta spend science to make science
[1:37:35] <%Daxalog> THIS is where the hell begins
[1:37:40] <Scorchfield> feed vials to lab for more tech
[1:37:44] <rafaelba93> now you need red potions
[1:37:46] <ColRedyx> Need 10 red science.
[1:37:48] <munitalprats> welcome to factorio hell
[1:37:48] <Calek> teeny tiny tutorial tech tree
[1:37:48] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Feed it the red science packs
[1:37:52] <+DrSmashy> gotta make the science now
[1:37:53] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt Science packs are the resources you need to make the research bar go up.
[1:37:53] <mattmmkay> Everyone's become a neanderthal since you've started this
[1:37:54] <LoneFonte> now check science recipe
[1:37:55] <amiavamp> potions and potoins
[1:37:56] <%BoxNavy> science packs...
[1:37:58] <snivins> science packs are like coal
[1:38:00] <h8t0r_m4rs> craft red science pack
[1:38:01] <%blistexthief> You need your finest potions
[1:38:03] <+Romuken> @PatStaresAt the research is queued, now make the science packs.
[1:38:03] <sirtommygunn> stuff lab with red juice science pack
[1:38:05] <EvanDude47> look at the research cost
[1:38:09] <%Tuna_Can_0> Make some red goop that teaches you how to make defensive walls atpCap
[1:38:10] <ColRedyx> Copper plate + iron gear = SCIENCE
[1:38:12] <munitalprats> Think of lab as science furnace, and packs are coal
[1:38:14] <duuupes> labs are like space elevators
[1:38:14] <sendart> gotta make the science
[1:38:16] <mattmmkay> fire bad; rock good
[1:38:16] <ShadeTheNovice> god the amount of speghetti i needed for these colored fucks the first time around
[1:38:16] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Same as everything else in the game, Pat
[1:38:18] <ISKMogul> Feed the copper plates and gears into assembler
[1:38:18] <LVL1_Scumbag> It's science
[1:38:19] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt You can make it by hand.
[1:38:20] <%Dunmarkh> build science juice
[1:38:20] <amiavamp> Science packs are the equivalent to space ladder parts in satisfactory
[1:38:20] <%VoidBaronJules> gotta automate for red and later green juice
[1:38:21] <LoneFonte> feed that to lab
[1:38:21] <%blastyoboots> @PatStaresAt right click for five at a time. craft by hand to start with
[1:38:28] <%DiscoMatador> Yes but better to make machine make these
[1:38:38] <ItIsSky> assembly magic
[1:38:39] <%lumporr> no longer making bullet
[1:38:39] <sirtommygunn> wait pat turn ammo production back on
[1:38:44] <$Dakuu75> imagine if the machines could talk and you could jsut ask, "Which one of you can make, THIS?" lol
[1:38:47] <+Onionchamp> assemblers can assemble almost fucking anything
[1:38:52] <munitalprats> no longer making bullet
[1:38:54] <penndrachen> HE'S LEARNING
[1:38:59] <+sulf> pat ur bullet factory is offline
[1:39:00] <+MillerLowlife> koolaid + glass = science
[1:39:04] <EvanDude47> I think you want labs I a more open area because you'll have to expand
[1:39:07] <Griffin1171> just put copper in therr
[1:39:07] <BwdYeti> Labs are your space elevator analogue, science packs are the things you make specifically for it
[1:39:08] <amiavamp> guys just keep in mind in this game there will always be a dozen goblins nagging you to complete them, the best mod for this game is a to-do list lol
[1:39:19] <unfoldingcactus> unfoldingcactus subscribed at Tier 3. 
[1:39:23] <%blastyoboots> build by hand too because they take FUCK LONG to make
[1:39:23] <%DiscoMatador> Now feed goo to ball
[1:39:24] <%lumporr> make lab closer
[1:39:24] <Expendamech> And here comes the spaghetti belts
[1:39:35] <ColRedyx> Science!
[1:39:37] <%lumporr> yY
[1:39:37] <A0N33> Science G E T!
[1:39:38] <spicystarbursts> I just logged in, this looks like a nightmare-scape of robot-arms

[1:39:40] <LoneFonte> noice
[1:39:41] <EvanDude47> top right
[1:39:41] <amiavamp> You can make more than 1 lab
[1:39:41] <+b_aleph> sparks fly
[1:39:42] <%VoidBaronJules> yay
[1:39:45] <+Romuken> Yes, but actually NO
[1:39:45] <%Daxalog> Now make a bajillion labs
[1:39:46] <%Dunmarkh> psaUp
[1:39:46] <%Solarint> do big science yeah!
[1:39:47] <ItIsSky> now it's just time
[1:39:48] <0range_> gj
[1:39:49] <rafaelba93> thats it... for now
[1:39:51] <mattmmkay> good good
[1:39:52] <%Tuna_Can_0> When you get to the point assembly machines start making assembly machines atpRtsuspectd
[1:39:53] <Expendamech> And put the science pack in the inventory into the lab
[1:39:55] <%lumporr> VICTORY ACHIEVED
[1:39:55] <ISKMogul> Now just scale that to infinity, basically
[1:39:55] <h8t0r_m4rs> SCIENCE

[1:39:59] <munitalprats> is a progress bar in top right
[1:39:59] <sirtommygunn> game is paused when checking science tab
[1:40:01] <Scorchfield> stone wall research is progressing now, nice job
[1:40:06] <EvanDude47> look above minimap
[1:40:06] <LoneFonte> now let it do thing on the top right
[1:40:09] <$Dakuu75> "ready and waiting"
[1:40:11] <mattmmkay> work work
[1:40:14] <%coward_man> the OCD has consumed Pat, he will make everything efficiant
[1:40:17] <%VoidBaronJules> top right shows your research progress
[1:40:18] <rafaelba93> more labs for more science if you have enough potion things
[1:40:19] <ColRedyx> Now just multiply that by a couple hundred and you're playing Factorio.
[1:40:19] <amiavamp> you got a research bar
[1:40:20] <Griffin1171> up iron production
[1:40:21] <+Romuken> More labs = faster gains.
[1:40:23] <G03933> please construct additional pylons

[1:41:05] <Griffin1171> you'll die
[1:41:09] <%VoidBaronJules> yep
[1:41:10] <$Dakuu75> OMG, those fuckers are FAST
[1:41:13] <sirtommygunn> for awhile
[1:41:13] <%Tuna_Can_0> atpCap
[1:41:13] <%EternalJedi> probably
[1:41:13] <+sulf> ur bullet factory is offline
[1:41:15] <%scallycap> lol baited
[1:41:15] <spicystarbursts> you lost an arm, but allt he bugs are dead
[1:41:15] <ShadeTheNovice> yep
[1:41:16] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[1:41:17] <amiavamp> They spawn infinitely while you're near the nests, but your bullets don't
[1:41:18] <munitalprats> go get bullet and TAKE THE FIGHT TO THEM!
[1:41:19] <mattmmkay> gun go bang bang
[1:41:21] <%lumporr> ammo
[1:41:23] <%lumporr> ammo is off
[1:41:23] <Dragovus> That was alot of health
[1:41:25] <Expendamech> @PatStaresAt please build an SMG
[1:41:26] <%Tuna_Can_0> FISH GET
[1:41:27] <%VoidBaronJules> you can exterminate ther hive
[1:41:28] <BwdYeti> They will also respawn pretty quickly
[1:41:32] <%ChestMimik> Factory is safety
[1:41:32] <snivins> if you dont leave who is going to pollute the world
[1:41:36] <+Romuken> yaaaay now do more research
[1:41:38] <%luftraumm1> ammo off
[1:41:38] <%VoidBaronJules> get's rid of the problem
[1:41:41] <%ChestMimik> And all must be made safe
[1:41:42] <%Tuna_Can_0> @PatStaresAt fish in water can heal you faster
[1:41:42] <munitalprats> Take the fight to them with smg, wipe out the bugs so they stop attacking you!
[1:41:44] <sirtommygunn> start new science!
[1:41:48] <penndrachen> you need to research better technology to kill the bugs more efficiently
[1:41:50] <gslayer14> are pipes still just cheaper walls?
[1:41:59] <LoneFonte> this is how you get new stuff on this game
[1:42:04] <mattmmkay> yea, who gone destroy the planet if you just up and leave without protecting it?
[1:42:05] <BlueLunecy> Time for green science
[1:42:12] <snivins> thats the game
[1:42:17] <%Tuna_Can_0> dont let it set in NotLikeThis
[1:42:18] <ShadeTheNovice> dont let it set in
[1:42:19] <munitalprats> make SMG tho
[1:42:19] <%Teyaric> "Car". HAH.
[1:42:19] <amiavamp> wait seriously the next step is cars?
[1:42:20] <bonebagMEL> ye ye ye ye
[1:42:23] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> An inserter will grab extra science packs from a Lab to deposit into another Lab. You can chain Labs and inserters in a line.
[1:42:23] <+Romuken> GUNWALL
[1:42:24] <mattmmkay> I mean destroying it
[1:42:26] <LoneFonte> TIME FOR CAR
[1:42:26] <%Daxalog> This is where you decide how patient you want to be with tech
[1:42:31] <%blastyoboots> right click wall for five at a time
[1:42:34] <%GeneralSCPatton> Possibilities E X P A N D
[1:42:39] <BlueLunecy> Shift click to make as many as you can
[1:42:39] <munitalprats> The next step is a bunch of tech, but the end of the tutorial is car @amiavamp
[1:42:39] <spicystarbursts> now youre safe
[1:42:40] <%Dunmarkh> LUL
[1:42:40] <EvanDude47> labs filled with science packs is this games version of satisfactory tiers
[1:42:44] <%Tuna_Can_0> GOOD
[1:42:44] <Flakari> Need lots of wall
[1:42:45] <LVL1_Scumbag> Good wall
[1:42:48] <mattmmkay> did you say pat's it?
[1:42:48] <%Daxalog> 3 walls
[1:42:49] <%Tuna_Can_0> atpCap
[1:42:50] <rafaelba93> guns shoot past walls
[1:42:53] <LoneFonte> gonna need a LOT of stone
[1:42:53] <%Solarint> wall!
[1:42:54] <%lumporr> you can progress at your own pace it's ok
[1:42:55] <sirtommygunn> you need a lot of stone for wall
[1:42:57] <snivins> now make a rocket
[1:42:57] <h8t0r_m4rs> need like 100
[1:42:58] <+Romuken> get wall tho
[1:43:00] <spicystarbursts> The Great WALL of PAT
[1:43:03] <%Tuna_Can_0> 1 wall 1 tile atpRtsd
[1:43:06] <amiavamp> @munitalprats ah, I thought things had changed more than I thought, I haven't played since right before 1.0 came out
[1:43:06] <%VoidBaronJules> you need like 36 to cut off that part of the ravine
[1:43:09] <%backfire_shot> backfire_shot subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 22 months! you cant get rid of me something always backfires and when it does ill be there.
[1:43:15] <LVL1_Scumbag> Maybe you can automate walls
[1:43:19] <Expendamech> mmmm spaghetti belts
[1:43:22] <+b_aleph> make car
[1:43:26] <EvanDude47> coal for the furnace too
[1:43:26] <mattmmkay> with big gun
[1:43:29] <munitalprats> you can automate EVERYTHING
[1:43:35] <%ChestMimik> You can automate anythng with a recipie
[1:43:37] <ISKMogul> Assembler automates everything
[1:43:38] <+Romuken> yes you can, you make that wall automate now!
[1:43:39] <mattynezz> Same as literally everything else
[1:43:42] <%blastyoboots> automate walls if you want em cause you'll need like a few hundred! but then your base will basically be invulnerable until the end of this tutorial.  wall is cooked stone + assembler
[1:43:44] <+Javaa01> You can automate anything and everything, with enough drones
[1:43:46] <spicystarbursts> automobilism sounds like a religion
[1:43:48] <%lumporr> burn stone into bricks and then use bricks to make walls
[1:43:51] <%MidnightBurst12> car
[1:43:51] <munitalprats> you need EVERYTHING
[1:43:52] <amiavamp> automating gates is like 10x harder than automating most things in this game
[1:43:52] <sirtommygunn> did they get rid of the tutorial level that was pure combat
[1:43:59] <%Solarint> I would honestly just go to freeplay now
[1:44:00] <rafaelba93> carism
[1:44:00] <mattmmkay> that's what science says anyways
[1:44:00] <%Tuna_Can_0> need green go first
[1:44:01] <bonebagMEL> It's like racism, but for cars
[1:44:01] <Calek> this tutorial is going in hard
[1:44:03] <sendart> Moar lab
[1:44:04] <ShadeTheNovice> C A R
[1:44:06] <%vivaldiva> time for research!
[1:44:07] <%Dunmarkh> You want logistics dude
[1:44:12] <munitalprats> you can go to the freeplay now though
[1:44:12] <Griffin1171> just research what you can
[1:44:12] <%Tuna_Can_0> atpRtsd
[1:44:12] <Shacklebox> Build an assembler
[1:44:14] <%ZeOrbling> this tutorial is extensive
[1:44:15] <%lumporr> your research is already automated all you have to do is pick the options
[1:44:16] <BwdYeti> Oh this tutorial looks like it'll take an hour or so, nice
[1:44:19] <sirtommygunn> Logistics is extremely good
[1:44:19] <+Romuken> Do it, PATRON THE COWARD
[1:44:20] <mattmmkay> moar lab for bigger gun
[1:44:22] <Scorchfield> yep, need to build up a bit to reach the point of cars
[1:44:25] <GunEden> this will take long better to start normal game
[1:44:31] <%blastyoboots> @PatStaresAt this round of tutorial is NOT A SHORT TUTORIAL ROUND this time, you are in for a long haul
[1:44:31] <spicystarbursts> Is this a spiteplay? Pat looks like hes having a rough time
[1:44:32] <munitalprats> you have a basic understanding of labs so ided just go to freeplay now if you wanted
[1:44:40] <%Broand> yeah this is where I'd go to free play, you know the basics of factory makin
[1:44:41] <+SergeEXE> This is all a build up to Dwarf Fortress. Master these basics to have Fun later
[1:44:44] <+sulf> walls are good
[1:44:45] <%lumporr> hahahah
[1:44:45] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Take your time, build a wall
[1:44:46] <%Solarint> @PatStaresAt Highly recommend you just switch to freeplay now to make your own stuff, bugs don't attack as often there
[1:44:47] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt You should feed the red science production into a box that feeds into the lab so you don't stop producing science.
[1:44:50] <%VoidBaronJules> you're ganna want them
[1:44:50] <%bassoontyphoon> Has pat conquered nature yet??
[1:44:51] <duuupes> walls kinda are bs this early in the game
[1:44:51] <Scorchfield> grow your factory to meet your needs
[1:44:51] <Flakari> Walls are super easy to make tho
[1:44:51] <snivins> enemies get stronger with pollution
[1:44:51] <%Tuna_Can_0> LUL
[1:44:52] <amiavamp> @spicystarbursts it *was* a spiteplay until Pat found out he loves Satisfactory
[1:44:52] <+Romuken> Walls will save your buttocks
[1:44:53] <BlueLunecy> Walls are great
[1:44:54] <mattynezz> They really aren't
[1:44:57] <mattmmkay> the tutorial's harder than the game
[1:45:00] <%StebTheVee> StebTheVee subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months, currently on a 5 month streak! I've been wondering why Elmo is called Peepee
[1:45:03] <%blistexthief> Pipes can be decent emergency walls
[1:45:07] <%blastyoboots> Yeah you can go to Freeplay if you want now
[1:45:09] <munitalprats> this tutorial is harder than the game is
[1:45:10] <+b_aleph> yaaay
[1:45:11] <snivins> yeah do it, go normal play
[1:45:11] <Calek> you're basically playing the game right now
[1:45:12] <LoneFonte> yeah, this step would take a 30m-1h
[1:45:13] <+fancypan> You know enough for thte main game now
[1:45:16] <Griffin1171> it'll take a while
[1:45:18] <Scorchfield> walls are great to slow down bugs while your gun turrets shoot them
[1:45:18] <sirtommygunn> Freeplay is easier
[1:45:18] <%Dunmarkh> HELL YEAH DUDE
[1:45:20] <%BoxNavy> ye
[1:45:22] <amiavamp> tutorial is not great, way too intense
[1:45:22] <%Tuna_Can_0> PogChamp
[1:45:23] <%Solarint> because LEARN
[1:45:24] <%Solarint> NOW
[1:45:28] <GustauveVIII> go into freeplay
[1:45:29] <GunEden> bumbling trough freeplay is easier
[1:45:30] <mattmmkay> have you played the tutorial?
[1:45:31] <%lumporr> it IS
[1:45:31] <ShadeTheNovice> i think you can start the game now, youve learnt enough
[1:45:32] <+Romuken> @PatStaresAt if you can hardmode in tutorial, you can play the game.
[1:45:32] <bonebagMEL> dude IT GOOOOES
[1:45:34] <%ChestMimik> Freeplay is legit easier
[1:45:34] <Expendamech> Freeplay and DISABLE BITERS @PatStaresAt
[1:45:37] <munitalprats> IT SUPER DOES
[1:45:38] <%VoidBaronJules> feels like it
[1:45:42] <amiavamp> tutorial feels like an actual RTS campaign
[1:45:43] <%blistexthief> The next level is fucked
[1:45:44] <oozebear> This seems like one of those games whose "tutorial" is just jumping you in like a gang
[1:45:46] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> That's fair, the tutorial is making sure you know how to do EVERYTHING, where freeplay you can learn by doing
[1:45:46] <%Tuna_Can_0> yea basically
[1:45:47] <VigilantShield> oh no it doesn't teach you everything
[1:45:48] <+TheEvaFreak> freeplay and turn off bugs
[1:45:49] <%Dunmarkh> FREEPLAY IS WAY SMOOTHER, EASIER, AND HAS LESS ENEMIES DUDE
[1:45:49] <Calek> don't disable biters, they're half the fun
[1:45:50] <GunEden> yes
[1:45:50] <snivins> dont disable bitters
[1:45:50] <sailercartridge> Rail world or enemy expansion disabled is good for first time
[1:45:50] <%backfire_shot> free play lets you learn at your own pace
[1:45:50] <ISKMogul> You can turn on peaceful to remove enemies
[1:45:51] <mattmmkay> ughhhhhh
[1:45:51] <+sulf> u might want to consider disabling enemies ur first game
[1:45:51] <Zero_Jacks> free is alot ezier
[1:45:53] <ShadeTheNovice> I love the tutorial honestly
[1:45:54] <LoneFonte> @PatStaresAt important choice, YOU CAN TURN OFF BUGS IF YOU WANT
[1:45:55] <%blistexthief> Good choice just skipping it
[1:45:57] <munitalprats> dont disable biters
[1:45:58] <Shacklebox> Yeah it does
[1:45:59] <+Javaa01> To an extent, you're not gonna get railway management from the "intro" tutorial
[1:46:00] <Scorchfield> well yes, it wants to put you in the thick of it
[1:46:01] <+ianabstract> Turn richness to max
[1:46:03] <Griffin1171> TURN OFF CLIFFS
[1:46:03] <%ChestMimik> I quit the tutorial when it expected me to make a science per minute but didn't explain ratios
[1:46:04] <%Tuna_Can_0> it drops you off at railroads atpCap
[1:46:06] <Expendamech> Tutorial really isn't paced well.
[1:46:07] <+Romuken> max enrichment
[1:46:07] <%TIME_PUNCHER> they confused Tutorial with Walkthrough
[1:46:08] <+DeaconBluesClues> I saw the steam title and went "uh oh"
[1:46:08] <IntrepidEye> Freeplay is easier because it lets you learn step by step instead of throwing you right into the shit
[1:46:10] <snivins> keep bugs in
[1:46:10] <Dirksolomon> dont disable biters
[1:46:11] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> You can turn bugs down a little, which is nice.
[1:46:11] <GunEden> put all resources too max
[1:46:16] <%scallycap> peaceful mode is good
[1:46:21] <%blastyoboots> just turn down enemy a LITTLE BIT
[1:46:21] <%bassoontyphoon> the tutorial is the equivalent of your swimming instructor pushing you into a wave pool with half-filled floaties and saying "figure it out"
[1:46:22] <munitalprats> Biters dont attack as often as the tutorial does
[1:46:26] <%VoidBaronJules> yeah I completely missed the fact you can build on broken machines until i reached the broken railway section
[1:46:27] <amiavamp> IMO set bugs to not respawn
[1:46:29] <%Teyaric> INFINITE resources is an option!
[1:46:30] <sirtommygunn> It's not just that it wants to teach you everything, it skips large chunks of the game where you would learn how to progress to the next part of the game
[1:46:31] <BwdYeti> Everything normal is pretty good, but you might want a larger starting area
[1:46:31] <+Romuken> @PatStaresAt you want fun?  MAX the richness!
[1:46:34] <%gear1033> HIt preview
[1:46:35] <EvanDude47> enemies are slower in freelance as well
[1:46:43] <rafaelba93> if its too much trouble you can turn off bugs
[1:46:49] <+sulf> press preview
[1:46:50] <munitalprats> Enemies are slower to attack in freeplay, no need to turn them down
[1:46:51] <snivins> leave it like that, bugs are life
[1:46:52] <+Romuken> @Teyaric wait it is?  Fudge, did not know that.
[1:47:03] <amiavamp> If you want to get rid of some big mind goblins turn off time and pollution evolution
[1:47:03] <KShirahama> Either peacful mode or increase starting area
[1:47:03] <+DeaconBluesClues> no! you will play a TvZ and like it
[1:47:04] <+TheEvaFreak> the enemy section
[1:47:05] <%backfire_shot> max everything true chaos is where the truth lies
[1:47:09] <+sulf> enemy bases
[1:47:10] <%VoidBaronJules> peaceful mode
[1:47:10] <%Broand> peaceful mode
[1:47:10] <Calek> "peaceful mode"
[1:47:10] <skrewarrior> peaceful mode
[1:47:12] <BwdYeti> If you want less bugs, increase the size of the starting area instead of turning the bugs themselves down
[1:47:12] <sailercartridge> toggle off enemy expansion
[1:47:13] <%Daxalog> They mean peaceful mode
[1:47:13] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> They mean don't turn off enemies
[1:47:14] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt pEACEFUL MODE is disable alien attacks.
[1:47:14] <snivins> dont do it, leave the bugs in
[1:47:15] <%ArticPath> Peaceful mode
[1:47:16] <sirtommygunn> Peaceful mode
[1:47:17] <%lumporr> i assume that's what peaceful is
[1:47:17] <ColRedyx> Try "Peaceful mode" if you just want to build.
[1:47:20] <%marsantas> Peaceful mode
[1:47:20] <Expendamech> Uncheck Enemy Bases
[1:47:21] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[1:47:22] <h8t0r_m4rs> Peaceful mode
[1:47:24] <duuupes> normal is good but you can still get unlucky on the maps
[1:47:24] <%scallycap> Peaceful Mode makes it so the enemies dont seek you out
[1:47:24] <penndrachen> peaceful mode but don't turn it on, it makes the game painfully boring
[1:47:27] <LoneFonte> red box up top
[1:47:27] <munitalprats> Dont turn on peaceful mode!
[1:47:29] <%VoidBaronJules> up
[1:47:29] <%lumporr> default reset at the top
[1:47:30] <%blastyoboots> don't disable them you won't get to have fun with all the weapons! and GUN TURRETS and stuff... just turn the biters down a BIT on the enemy base frequency/size
[1:47:35] <%VoidBaronJules> second option
[1:47:40] <+TheEvaFreak> enemy == biters
[1:47:43] <EvanDude47> leave the enemies in, they are way less frequent I freeplay
[1:47:43] <sirtommygunn> Near the top, peaceful mode
[1:47:45] <+sulf> dont do that :)
[1:47:46] <mattmmkay> that sounds fun
[1:47:48] <%Kay_Tana> Peaceful mode
[1:47:51] <+pandamandasmash> peaceful mode
[1:47:52] <%Tuna_Can_0> :)
[1:47:52] <%R3Roundabout> psaBlind psaBlind psaBlind
[1:47:55] <snivins> do default @PatStaresAt
[1:47:57] <munitalprats> just leave it at factory settings
[1:47:58] <%Kay_Tana> under enemy bases
[1:47:59] <%GeneralSCPatton> Peaceful
[1:48:03] <h8t0r_m4rs> just do DEfault
[1:48:04] <+ianabstract> rich resources
[1:48:04] <amiavamp> default is ok
[1:48:04] <%BoxNavy> do death world :)
[1:48:06] <%lumporr> good choice
[1:48:06] <%blastyoboots> oh dear
[1:48:06] <+Javaa01> Death World is real ass "fight for your life" survival starting out
[1:48:08] <Dirksolomon> put frequency down on enemy
[1:48:09] <%Tuna_Can_0> PogChamp
[1:48:09] <%gear1033> @PatStaresAt hit preview to see map
[1:48:10] <%scallycap> normal settings is good
[1:48:11] <%lumporr> biters don't bother you for a while
[1:48:12] <+D00msDayDan> crank resource deposits up
[1:48:13] <%Solarint> Default is fine
[1:48:15] <snivins> killing bugs is fun chat
[1:48:16] <mattmmkay> it's like Disney World but for people that don't believe in COVID
[1:48:17] <ShadeTheNovice> leave everything as it is yeah
[1:48:18] <+Onionchamp> peaceful is for cowards
[1:48:18] <%king_wragles> Man, this back seat is huge
[1:48:19] <%Tuna_Can_0> thats usually a good choice :)
[1:48:21] <LoneFonte> NOW
[1:48:21] <Expendamech> UNCHECK THE BOX FOR ENEMY BASES OR CHECK PEACEFUL MODE BOX @PatStaresAt
[1:48:25] <munitalprats> Biters wont bother you for a long while, and its fun to kill bugs.
[1:48:25] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Shit's fucked
[1:48:27] <+Javaa01> 2/10 parking job
[1:48:29] <%Tuna_Can_0> Didnt even preview, what a boss
[1:48:30] <amiavamp> enemies don't attack very often at the start even on default, you need to spread pollution for them to notice you
[1:48:36] <%scallycap> if you think the bugs are too intense, peaceful mode is fun to just vibe with
[1:48:37] <sirtommygunn> Salvage craft
[1:48:38] <penndrachen> monkaS
[1:48:40] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Yayyy, time for spaghett
[1:48:41] <+Romuken> hee hoo here we go, time to launch science into space to fight bug jesus
[1:48:46] <%Kay_Tana> *facepalm* lp tax ahoy
[1:48:46] <%blistexthief> Time to murder the planet
[1:48:48] <+wizard_of_diamonds> No preview? What a chad
[1:48:49] <ShadeTheNovice> especially when you can kill bases it gets real fun to kill bugs
[1:48:52] <duuupes> oh man no trees pollution is gonna be rough
[1:48:53] <huskarl_zap> Mine the ship
[1:48:55] <munitalprats> Everyones saying go on peaceful as if the tutorial wasnt incredibly more violent
[1:49:00] <+JonWhoLovesFlatWomen> its time!
[1:49:03] <LVL1_Scumbag> Map is infinite
[1:49:06] <%blastyoboots> @PatStaresAt map is autogenerated and literally infinite
[1:49:07] <+D00msDayDan> oh boy desert start, get ready for many biters
[1:49:08] <+DrSmashy> the map is infinite
[1:49:08] <%Tuna_Can_0> big you say atpCap
[1:49:10] <%Broand> the map is infinite
[1:49:11] <amiavamp> oof yeah no trees means pollution go spread fast
[1:49:14] <Expendamech> NotLikeThis He didn't disable biters OR check peaceful mode NotLikeThis
[1:49:14] <BwdYeti> Very good starting location, other than the bugs close to the west
[1:49:16] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt You can scrap the rocket ship for more resources.
[1:49:16] <%Dunmarkh> wow this is a nice spawn
[1:49:16] <+sulf> enemies wont attack u for a while
[1:49:17] <LoneFonte> red is enemies
[1:49:20] <EvanDude47> this is one benefit factorio has over satisfactory though, is that the world is generated
[1:49:22] <mattmmkay> gief's a snufflapagus
[1:49:25] <ISKMogul> Oh hell, no trees to mitigate pollution
[1:49:26] <%Dunmarkh> @Expendamech FUCKING GOOD
[1:49:39] <sirtommygunn> Don't worry about oil/uranium, you're not getting to either of them tonight
[1:49:41] <%AncelDeLambert> nuclear power is fucking HARD to get up and running, man
[1:49:42] <munitalprats> no trees on this start
[1:49:48] <amiavamp> you have a big central area where there's no enemy spawns
[1:49:57] <0range_> build tool
[1:49:58] <%Tuna_Can_0> peaceful mode is for cowards atpCop
[1:50:01] <+sulf> rip ship
[1:50:04] <%AncelDeLambert> nuclear is WEEKS away
[1:50:05] <munitalprats> pretty rough start with no trees
[1:50:07] <%Solarint> bye ship
[1:50:12] <penndrachen> no trees is concerning
[1:50:12] <LVL1_Scumbag> Trees are for losers. They limit expansion.
[1:50:16] <Scorchfield> eh, you don't really need a lot of wood so its fine
[1:50:20] <%lumporr> Leave No Trace
[1:50:23] <amiavamp> 1 dead tree
[1:50:23] <Expendamech> Pollution clouds spread out enough to reach the initial biters quickly @amiavamp
[1:50:24] <LoneFonte> the world is now your canvas
[1:50:27] <%AncelDeLambert> trees are best removed with grenades
[1:50:32] <%blastyoboots> @AncelDeLambert i always plug in a blueprint code from the internet for nuclear power, including circuits to keep things rotated properly and alert me when fuel gets low
[1:50:38] <mattmmkay> why does the main crash his ship on so many planets?
[1:50:40] <skrewarrior> catch a fish
[1:50:47] <%Dunmarkh> @AncelDeLambert nah man, flamethrowers
[1:50:47] <%AncelDeLambert> @blastyoboots me too, fuck doing the math myself
[1:50:57] <+DeaconBluesClues> quick build a huge coal fire power plant before the lorax shows up and breaks you kneecaps
[1:50:58] <%Daxalog> Remember you can customize your colors
[1:51:00] <%ChestMimik> @mattmmkay Don't play satisfactorio and pilot at the same time
[1:51:01] <amiavamp> it's a badland
[1:51:03] <munitalprats> thats enough tree
[1:51:19] <duuupes> the trees can't be harmed if the lorax is armed
[1:51:22] <%bassoontyphoon> Pat does to the environment what Paige does to vvymyn
[1:51:24] <BwdYeti> bootiful
[1:51:26] <zedravan> nice indigo
[1:51:34] <Manwad> What if it was PURPLE?
[1:51:38] <skrewarrior> nice and blue
[1:51:45] <+sulf> this is enough for dozens of hours
[1:51:47] <%bassoontyphoon> Nice gamecube blue
[1:51:58] <amiavamp> can't wait for the goblins that come with mixing miners with 2 different ores
[1:52:00] <%marsantas> Yeah resources are 'limited' but never actually something you worry about running out of
[1:52:05] <BoneofMalkav> Have we met Pat's friend I-Ron yet?
[1:52:09] <munitalprats> you played the tutorial funny man, go on get it!
[1:52:10] <%Tuna_Can_0> mixed resources NotLikeThis
[1:52:15] <Manwad> map's infinite
[1:52:20] <%blastyoboots> @sulf yeah he has enough resources for HOURS! he'll be out before he knows it.  :)
[1:52:25] <%lumporr> FIRST STEP: COMPLETE
[1:52:27] <peanutdot007> This is a lot closer to automated minecraft mods
[1:52:46] <LoneFonte> the game IS based on minecraft mods
[1:52:50] <mattmmkay> I-Ron must have not read the terms and conditions apple laid carefully. He belongs to apple now
[1:53:07] <cochramd1992> oh god, it's a hideous lovechild of minecraft and starcraft
[1:53:13] <%Solarint> IT BEGINS
[1:53:15] <turtlegryphon> Has someone taught pat how to make incestuous coal miners yet?
[1:53:18] <sirtommygunn> it begins
[1:53:24] <munitalprats> here we **go**
[1:53:33] <mattmmkay> did you say incestuous?
[1:53:37] <%scallycap> @PatStaresAt if you hit M you can see how much pollution you have
[1:53:41] <penndrachen> oh yeah, Pat if you put two miners on coal right next to each other, they can feed into one another and make infinite coal.
[1:53:42] <sirtommygunn> yeah but he didn't like it and immediately made them stop
[1:53:42] <TigerClaws12> LUL
[1:53:44] <munitalprats> on your map, its a big fog cloud
[1:53:45] <%Mrbaconator> it appears on the map
[1:53:46] <Calek> open the map and click the pollution button
[1:53:49] <amiavamp> It shows up as red clouds on the map. And the buildings show their pollution when you highlight over them
[1:53:50] <ShadeTheNovice> @turtlegryphon we tried but he refused to understand
[1:53:50] <%ChestMimik> It's a toggle on the map
[1:53:51] <LoneFonte> @turtlegryphon man LUL
[1:53:53] <%Daxalog> Become as smog
[1:53:58] <CrimsonFox777> Like that. :)
[1:53:59] <ISKMogul> The red cloud on the map screen icon is the pollution button
[1:54:00] <%blastyoboots> @PatStaresAt there's a pollution button on the map you need to click
[1:54:04] <+D00msDayDan> hit the pollution toggle in the map filters
[1:54:04] <BwdYeti> Also in the top right the graph submenu has a pollution screen, but it's kind of obtuse
[1:54:04] <oozebear> Pat is precariously close to being a White Minecraft Youtuber Man, may need an intervention soon
[1:54:05] <%scallycap> @PatStaresAt if the pollution reaches the bugs theyll attack you
[1:54:06] <munitalprats> when it touches biters they'll get upset and start attacking
[1:54:06] <VTuberEloiyse> Bork
[1:54:07] <augusta_wind> bork
[1:54:08] <+Javaa01> @cochramd1992 Well that second half comes into play only with mods, but yeah this is based on a modpack for Minecraft
[1:54:09] <%lumporr> there's also tabs to your electricity interface that let you look at pollution
[1:54:10] <Expendamech> Map Screen - Tab beneath the minimap
[1:54:12] <+vaderxyz1970> The trees begin to die
[1:54:14] <penndrachen> OhMyDog
[1:54:17] <sirtommygunn> pollution isn't a problem for a long time
[1:54:19] <+DrGrudge> if you click on the graph button above your minimap you can check your pollution stats
[1:54:21] <%Kay_Tana> big red bloches
[1:54:22] <mattmmkay> should look like gren fart gas
[1:54:27] <LoneFonte> wind
[1:54:28] <%marsantas> Wind
[1:54:29] <%lumporr> trees!
[1:54:30] <BlackStarAura> *pollution intensifies*
[1:54:31] <Calek> because wind
[1:54:31] <gslayer14> wind
[1:54:32] <peanutdot007> Wind
[1:54:32] <%Daxalog> Wind
[1:54:32] <+vaderxyz1970> Wind?
[1:54:34] <munitalprats> wind!
[1:54:34] <%blastyoboots> pollution is estimated in squares
[1:54:34] <VigilantShield> because of trees countering it
[1:54:35] <Tisaric> quick little trick to get early coal production - a coal miner feeding into another coal miner that is feeding back to the original is infinite mining
[1:54:37] <$Dakuu75> wind?
[1:54:38] <Griffin1171> chunks
[1:54:41] <penndrachen> wind also it's chunk based
[1:54:45] <%Dunmarkh> wind doesn't exist
[1:54:48] <%muetank> Pat is just gona become a bad guy from Captain Planet
[1:54:48] <Melchior_the_Wise> W I N D
[1:54:49] <+DrGrudge> your ship maybe
[1:54:50] <Expendamech> Chunk based math checks @PatStaresAt
[1:54:51] <%lumporr> wait wtf wind? i thought it was because trees absorb polution
[1:54:56] <munitalprats> trees too
[1:54:56] <BwdYeti> The pollution is rendered per chunk of the map, and can move around from wind
[1:55:01] <mattmmkay> wind was invented by the government
[1:55:05] <%Kay_Tana> its by zone
[1:55:06] <Dumple_Roe> air that blows whatever
[1:55:07] <peanutdot007> Wind is trees farting
[1:55:11] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Circle is you not the Pollution
[1:55:13] <%Solarint> smh it doesn't even simulate trillions of pollution particles in real time? bad game
[1:55:13] <$Dakuu75> No, the polution actually isn't moving, but the plaent your standing on is rotating
[1:55:14] <amiavamp> wind is produced by the fake birds
[1:55:14] <+D00msDayDan> wind isn't real
[1:55:19] <%blistexthief> Wind is fake, just like birds
[1:55:20] <Dirksolomon> Find big rocks to mine bunch of rocks
[1:55:27] <+Javaa01> @lumporr They do, but Pat is in the middle of a desert, which aren't known for their lush forests
[1:55:30] <%blastyoboots> @PatStaresAt it's not wind-- Trees absorb lots of pollution until they get withered and die. dead trees are still good for wood! just not for absorbing pollution~
[1:55:37] <Flakari> Get two coal miners feeding one another
[1:55:43] <Tisaric> @PatStaresAt point 2 burner miners at each other on top of coal so they feed each other and mine to full stacks
[1:55:45] <0range_> hahaa liitle doggy
[1:55:45] <%lumporr> @lumporr there were trees to the left
[1:55:57] <%lumporr> your electricity interface has tabs where you can see a bunch of statistics including pollution also
[1:55:57] <peanutdot007> Stonks go up now
[1:55:58] <Flakari> Then just take from the miners
[1:56:00] <Dirksolomon> you can put coal miners to feed coal into each other on top of coal
[1:56:02] <%BoxNavy> yea
[1:56:04] <Pookiedaexzile> This Doom DLC is really different from the base game
[1:56:25] <munitalprats> yeah the lack of trees
[1:56:27] <$Dakuu75> fuck this planet, I guess
[1:56:28] <mattmmkay> way to go pat
[1:56:30] <+sulf> when it touches a biter nest they begin to attack
[1:56:33] <Tisaric> yeah pollution gets out of hand really quickly
[1:56:33] <amiavamp> This start has fast pollution spread without trees to absorb it (I think water does too?)
[1:56:35] <Dirksolomon> Desert. no trees to slurp pollution
[1:56:35] <cochramd1992> if only you had a green source of power.....
[1:56:37] <BwdYeti> Once the polution overlaps the bugs, that base will start attacking
[1:56:37] <$RealThiele> fuck the planet
[1:56:39] <%BoxNavy> max out pollution moon2DEV
[1:56:39] <%blastyoboots> @PatStaresAt those are LIGHT red squares, not medium or dark red squares ;)
[1:56:45] <sirtommygunn> coal is bad for the environment, as it turns out
[1:56:45] <+Onionchamp> you're burning coal what did you expect
[1:56:47] <+DrGrudge> once you get electricity you can reduce your pollution output a bit
[1:56:51] <munitalprats> full pollution!
[1:56:56] <%lumporr> do y'all use the statistics menu?
[1:56:59] <$Dakuu75> "looting and polluting, is not the way, hear what captain plaent, has to say~"
[1:57:02] <mattmmkay> you've made a planet that's as bad as toronto
[1:57:02] <+GTsunamii> when has pollution ever caused problems for anyone
[1:57:04] <oozebear> Pat's giving mother nature just the biggest noogie right now
[1:57:05] <amiavamp> Captain planet villain also has $$$
[1:57:06] <peanutdot007> This is what it feels like to make NFTs
[1:57:07] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Aim your coal miners at each other.
[1:57:07] <%Mrbaconator> YES
[1:57:08] <%blastyoboots> absolutely!
[1:57:09] <Orenjevel> only trust your guns, trees will never help you
[1:57:09] <%Dunmarkh> psaBougie
[1:57:21] <%Treuan> What is pollution but littering on a larger scale
[1:57:24] <munitalprats> Pollution can easily be solved with more Pollution!
[1:57:30] <amiavamp> Later you can torch trees with bombs and flamethrowers..
[1:57:37] <+dante_must_die_exe> Trees are fuck
[1:57:39] <BoneofMalkav> Press T to summon Okakoro for a TeeTee Moment
[1:57:41] <%blastyoboots> @peanutdot007 lul
[1:57:43] <0range_> oyesh
[1:57:43] <DartAran> It's okay what's wasting one planet to save yourself (one person)
[1:57:47] <Tisaric> so now they'll just mine into each other until the stacks are full
[1:57:47] <%scallycap> that coal trick fucking sucks
[1:57:48] <%Dunmarkh> YEAH
[1:57:48] <huskarl_zap> UNLIMITED POWER
[1:57:48] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> It's a good trick
[1:57:55] <BwdYeti> It keeps the drills running since they feed each other, and they act as chests for you to come back to
[1:58:00] <rafaelba93> take your time
[1:58:00] <mattmmkay> The science says that if you throw more pol;lution at pollution it just kind of attacks the other one
[1:58:01] <+Romuken> infinite power, boom
[1:58:04] <Orenjevel> Perpetual coaling machine
[1:58:05] <Scorchfield> might need to make guns and ammo a priority so you can wipe out that closest biter base early
[1:58:06] <%Dunmarkh> PLUG THE EXTENSION CORD INTO ITSELF
[1:58:09] <LoneFonte> now make a miner centipede
[1:58:09] <ChungusQuest> Mother Nature started this fight for survival, and she wants to quit because she's losing?  Well I say hard cheese!
[1:58:10] <skrewarrior> it's pretty busted
[1:58:12] <ShadeTheNovice> you can pull out of them like chests
[1:58:14] <+D00msDayDan> that's some troll science shit
[1:58:16] <oozebear> coal miner circlejerk
[1:58:19] <sirtommygunn> digusting
[1:58:21] <mattmmkay> like Godzila
[1:58:25] <%Solarint> powar get
[1:58:32] <+sulf> electric power
[1:58:34] <amiavamp> need to work toward electricity
[1:58:37] <+Romuken> quickly, put the rice crispie treat in the microwave for 20 seconds for optimal gooeyness
[1:58:46] <Orenjevel> now do a four-way coal machine for maximum power
[1:58:47] <%Dunmarkh> Get an ar-15 and electricity
[1:58:49] <Tisaric> you can expand the coal miner trick too but it's not worth it
[1:58:54] <%lumporr> copper
[1:59:16] <SaltyAzteca> Friday Night Factorio hell yea
[1:59:22] <+InvertableQuasar> Is he still in the tutorials or is this the game proper?
[1:59:32] <amiavamp> This is freeplay
[1:59:32] <%lumporr> this the game proper
[1:59:32] <+GTsunamii> game proper
[1:59:35] <LoneFonte> just began proper game
[1:59:38] <ShadeTheNovice> game proper
[1:59:39] <LVL1_Scumbag> No furnace?
[1:59:40] <+Romuken> bork
[1:59:40] <%blastyoboots> @SaltyAzteca Friday Night Factorio Hell, you said it XD
[1:59:43] <Griffin1171> oh, good. he knows the coal trick
[1:59:47] <+InvertableQuasar> Nice, thanks!
[1:59:48] <%baka_sugoi> psaDogchamp
[1:59:53] <%EternalJedi> sir?
[1:59:55] <%Arweynn> sir this is not a wendys sir
[1:59:55] <bonebagMEL> sir?
[2:00:02] <mattmmkay> he wants to help destroy the planet
[2:00:07] <%lumporr> y'know i never clocked that deserts would probably be more pollutey than non-deserts bc no absorbtion
[2:00:10] <+Romuken> he's doing it
[2:00:10] <TurtlesAndTentacles> This is Factario?
[2:00:17] <amiavamp> pollution: fuck
[2:00:21] <SirCacaPee> this is art
[2:00:23] <munitalprats> dont worry about pollution!
[2:00:27] <+D00msDayDan> @TurtlesAndTentacles actually it's Factoire
[2:00:30] <%lumporr> check the statistics menu for actual pollution stats!
[2:00:31] <TurtlesAndTentacles> OOOH Im thinking of Satisfactory
[2:00:34] <%lumporr> you're good!
[2:00:38] <Calek> build machine gun and take out enemy base
[2:00:41] <snivins> you mean Epic Games Store Water
[2:00:41] <%AncelDeLambert> psaDogchamp "Father, why are you feeding generators and not me? Father!" psaDogchamp
[2:00:45] <+repmr> Oof. Yeah, desert maps are brutal for pollution.
[2:00:48] <munitalprats> You'll always be making pollution for a LONG while
[2:00:54] <Bluecille> steam water. as opposed to origin water?
[2:00:54] <amiavamp> your starting gun + ammo is good enough to handle attacks for now
[2:01:00] <%megalons> who cares about polluting this world. You can always go colonize another one and terraform it Kappa Kappa
[2:01:07] <Griffin1171> prep your weapons and do a preemintive strike
[2:01:08] <munitalprats> Desert maps are hard mode though because no trees to absorb pollution
[2:01:11] <%AncelDeLambert> pollution is forever. Even the fabricators produce it
[2:01:12] <mattmmkay> the factories need me, my boy
[2:01:18] <+sulf> the beginning is the hardest part
[2:01:28] <munitalprats> BIG ROCK
[2:01:29] <gslayer14> have you seen those challenge maps that are only 16 tiles wide? wacky stuff
[2:01:34] <%AncelDeLambert> the beginning is pretty rough
[2:01:37] <%lumporr> you can mine huge rock!
[2:01:39] <Vex_Machina> WOAH
[2:01:39] <Expendamech> @megalons But lets never fund NASA or any of the other space agencies KappaPride
[2:01:40] <ShadeTheNovice> yeah its pretty much a horror game at the start
[2:01:44] <BwdYeti> huge rock is full of resources
[2:01:44] <mattmmkay> Dwayne Johnson is here?
[2:01:46] <%BoxNavy> 🪨
[2:01:51] <leinadtonu> I bet that rock has huge guts
[2:01:53] <rafaelba93> it is
[2:01:53] <amiavamp> IMO satisfactory has a much smoother start, but then, they have an entire genre to learn from
[2:01:58] <+D00msDayDan> YOU'RE HUGE! THAT MEANS YOU HAVE HUGE STONE!
[2:02:02] <%walternatorz> psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp

[2:02:04] <%BoxNavy> ARF
[2:02:18] <invalid_robin> Is this freeplay mode now?
[2:02:23] <%blastyoboots> uh turn it the other way you don't have room for steam engines XD
[2:02:29] <%AncelDeLambert> LUL
[2:02:31] <Griffin1171> IN THE DOGHOUSE
[2:02:35] <LoneFonte> we're in freeplay now, yeah
[2:02:36] <bonebagMEL> THE BEANS!?
[2:02:37] <munitalprats> not enugh space
[2:02:37] <%AncelDeLambert> NO MORE QUESTIONS! RING!
[2:02:44] <ShadeTheNovice> LUL
[2:02:49] <Orenjevel> Think about the future! One pump can fill many steam boys!
[2:02:51] <amiavamp> rocket fuel powered boiler
[2:02:55] <%Daxalog> Or wood
[2:02:55] <fojidoj> 1000IQ
[2:02:55] <+DrGrudge> ring? what are you? CHRISTIAN?
[2:02:56] <Bluecille> BeanPat
[2:02:58] <leinadtonu> one ring to control the Paidge
[2:03:02] <%lumporr> YOU CAN PIPE THE WATER TO THE COAL
[2:03:04] <%walternatorz> Pat, you have to hold that card for things that aren't leaving beans out.
[2:03:06] <+CtrlShiftKill> pat gonna suck ass for coal
[2:03:08] <%AncelDeLambert> yep, always have power next to a coal deposit
[2:03:10] <Griffin1171> just feed manually for now
[2:03:13] <munitalprats> you can pipe the water over instead
[2:03:15] <Scorchfield> you might want to pipe the water away and heat it elsewhere, so you don't have to get coal out there
[2:03:17] <LoneFonte> unless...
[2:03:21] <+ianabstract> either pipe water to the coal or conveyor coal to the water
[2:03:23] <LVL1_Scumbag> Either belt coal out or pipe water in
[2:03:24] <EvanDude47> big pipe
[2:03:28] <%AncelDeLambert> god, wait until he learns about central buses
[2:03:36] <gslayer14> pipe to onsite boiler, yeah
[2:03:39] <Manwad> The madman
[2:03:52] <+Loyks> noooo
[2:03:57] <amiavamp> I think learning about central buses is inevitable when you try feeding an entire base worth with a single iron belt
[2:03:58] <+moonyshines> moonyshines subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! Hey Pat hope you doing well, been listening to the podcast for years but only after I moved from montreal!
[2:04:01] <%blastyoboots> @PatStaresAt better to make the boilers near the pump, you need extra pumps if the pipe gets too long and you don't have those researched yet!!! belts of coal to the boilers near the lake is better AND cheaper
[2:04:06] <munitalprats> You're gonna be restructuring your base multiple times anyway
[2:04:07] <BwdYeti> Piping to the coal is a good idea, since the pollution source will be closer to the rest of your base so you can protect it
[2:04:07] <%lumporr> you're blocking it with your character
[2:04:14] <%walternatorz> psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp
[2:04:15] <%AncelDeLambert> I do like how Dyson Sphere said "nah fuck pipes, pipes are lame"
[2:04:20] <einSynd> Pat attempting a beltless run his first attempt, I see
[2:04:29] <%lumporr> check out underground pipe if you're doing long distance pipe
[2:04:37] <%blastyoboots> @BwdYeti pumps are needed every 20 pipes or so though!!!! D:
[2:04:41] <+DrGrudge> don't forget about conveyor belts
[2:04:42] <munitalprats> it super is
[2:04:50] <skrewarrior> pipes become less efficient the longer they are
[2:04:53] <turtlegryphon> Make underground pipes oh god
[2:04:53] <amiavamp> @AncelDeLambert after spending 3 hours yesterday in Satisfactory on pipes that would randomly stop flowing into each other until I rebuilt the whole thing, I concur
[2:05:05] <%scallycap> youd rather bring the coal to the water because at least you can walk over conveyors
[2:05:06] <%lumporr> compromise and put in middle?
[2:05:11] <Expendamech> @PatStaresAt Underground pipes count as a single section, moving liquids faster and letting you pass by them
[2:05:12] <%scallycap> nah
[2:05:12] <+D00msDayDan> better to belt coal over to the water than pipe water over to the coal, water pressure is a thing in this game
[2:05:14] <amiavamp> later on you get a faster delete
[2:05:17] <BwdYeti> Earlygame you'll use so little water that's not a big deal, and you can switch to underground pipes to gimmick the pipe count
[2:05:18] <%Dunmarkh> yeah, grenades
[2:05:22] <+DrGrudge> way later there is
[2:05:22] <Psyramics> later there is
[2:05:22] <+Loyks> not untill you have robots
[2:05:22] <Manwad> power lines
[2:05:22] <gslayer14> got drones? otherwise, no.
[2:05:26] <einSynd> Later you can force robots to delete for you, but that's not for a long while
[2:05:28] <Griffin1171> not for a while
[2:05:32] <%ChrisPlaysThing> yeah, restart Kappa
[2:05:38] <darkjiku> there should be drag delete right?
[2:05:40] <BwdYeti> They're expensive though
[2:05:44] <%blastyoboots> @PatStaresAt fast delete doesn't happen until you have drones and deconstruction blueprints
[2:05:45] <mattmmkay> nani
[2:05:52] <Scorchfield> later on you can make drones disassemble your old bases for you
[2:05:57] <munitalprats> this map wasnt easy
[2:06:03] <Orenjevel> about as much as 10 above ground
[2:06:09] <+MobileHomeHeroes> you better not lay any pipe without your lady around
[2:06:16] <%Dunmarkh> fast delete happens when you invent nuclear weapons psaDab
[2:06:22] <LVL1_Scumbag> Can also just manually load it at the beginning
[2:06:24] <kazadaz> Man this game looks so much sharper these days
[2:06:25] <GunEden> i would just reroll the map at this point
[2:06:42] <Tisaric> It's smart to use burner inserters for the power production so they never go out with the power
[2:06:49] <%lumporr> might want to meet pipes and belts in the middle
[2:06:58] <Scorchfield> eh, its ether make lots of belts or lots of pipes, whichever way you want to do it
[2:07:04] <kazadaz> your pollution is terrible there should be way more
[2:07:12] <%lumporr> i mean he already has a lot of pipes tho
[2:07:14] <Dragovus> Pat when are you gonna beat Captain Planet?
[2:07:17] <%backfire_shot> cant wait for pat to learn that shotguns are great for deforestation until you build a flamethrower of course
[2:07:22] <BwdYeti> I would recommend getting to like 5 iron drills/furnaces before bothering with electricity, just to bootstrap your resource numbers
[2:07:51] <amiavamp> The starting zone has the least dense resources, they get more dense the further from the start yo ugo

[2:09:45] <amiavamp> rule of thumb, you never have enough iron

[2:09:59] <Griffin1171> check pollution
[2:10:28] <kazadaz> Pollution is basically your score
[2:10:29] <%backfire_shot> get hype to never have enough copper
[2:10:31] <%blistexthief> Nonstop infinite eye-ron
[2:10:40] <zedravan> not enough pollution Kappa
[2:10:42] <sirtommygunn> pollution is your high score

[2:11:50] <zedravan> real now because of crazy talk
[2:11:51] <%toastybites> the bugs are the hero of the story
[2:11:52] <+fancypan> The planet doesn't care, its free growth hormone
[2:11:52] <Orenjevel> well, you're *already* in a barren wasteland
[2:11:55] <%za7az> Just got here, how's the game so far?
[2:11:56] <+thelonechris> Pat's pretty much a Captain Planet villain at this point
[2:12:01] <sirtommygunn> you think that's pollution? you are like small baby
[2:12:04] <peanutdot007> Climate change isn't real if you destroy the atmosphere first
[2:12:06] <Varanoo> It must be too real to touch
[2:12:08] <+Javaa01> The pollution you can't see, but the lung carcinomas you are developing are very real
[2:12:09] <%ChrisPlaysThing> What doesn't kill you ends the race faster

[2:12:44] <%JoshManVGH> Fun Fact: One of Captain Planets Villians was named "Duke Nukem." The show aired just 10 months before Apogee released the original Duke Nukem game. Apogee tried to duck a legal fight and briefly changed the name to "Nukum" but then found out that Ted Turner never put a copywrite on Duke Nukem. m
[2:12:50] <%backfire_shot> need inserters
[2:12:54] <Expendamech> Yet
[2:13:20] <%Mrbaconator> spaghetti
[2:13:27] <Manwad> he run
[2:13:28] <amiavamp> @za7az the beginning of factorio is legitimately stressful though because you're basically on a time limit and have to do a dozen things at one time lol
[2:13:31] <kazadaz> forest's gotta go
[2:13:57] <darkjiku> that reminds me cant you actually fish in this game by just putting down an inserter at the lake
[2:14:11] <spicystarbursts> so is the purpose of this game to pollute the planet?
[2:14:19] <amiavamp> too bad you can't put a miner in the water to literally mine for fish
[2:14:30] <kazadaz> the purpose of the game is to make the factory bigger
[2:14:35] <+Javaa01> @spicystarbursts And slaughter the indigenous species, yes
[2:14:43] <%za7az> @amiavamp Interesting approach. I suppose it makes it that much more rewarding once you have a mega factory
[2:14:48] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt Proper Pump:Boiler:Engine ratio is 1:10:20 by the way.
[2:14:49] <%lumporr> also poles
[2:14:51] <rhetoricalAcrobat> i am inserter, please insert inserter
[2:15:07] <amiavamp> @spicystarbursts technically the "win condition" is launching a rocket to space. After that, you get post-game research that's increasingly expensive and increases the efficiency of your miners
[2:15:15] <darkjiku> the end objective is to make a big fuckoff rocket to get outta here, but you might as well kill of the locals for all the hell they caused you :)
[2:15:18] <+whoami777> @spicystarbursts the point is to build a rocket to get off the planet, but to do so requires big factory big pollution
[2:15:42] <%lumporr> you need electricity first
[2:15:48] <kazadaz> and some wires
[2:15:58] <%Undenizen> My friend got really into this game. It turned him into an industrialist cultist.
[2:16:03] <bywayIdler> @spicystarnursts You're trying to build a rocket and escape, and the best way to do that is act like a Captain Planet villain.
[2:16:09] <Dirksolomon> It is not in the grid
[2:16:12] <%scallycap> pollute the planet, and then leave this shitty polluted planet
[2:16:13] <spicystarbursts> is there a point in the game where the planet air quality gets so bad that you can't achieve the rocket ending?
[2:16:14] <Tisaric> @PatStaresAt it might be smart to use burner inserters with anything involving coal so it doesn't end up requiring power at all
[2:16:16] <%BestTeaMaker> power poles
[2:16:17] <%lumporr> need wires
[2:16:19] <%lumporr> poles
[2:16:21] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Are those set up right?

[2:16:37] <snivins> right click makes 5 @PatStaresAt
[2:16:42] <amiavamp> @spicystarbursts not directly but if your pollution is too bad the enemies will overpower you and make the game really hard

[2:17:24] <peanutdot007> PogChamp
[2:17:25] <+CanonFang_> something is bothering me about this and i don't know what
[2:17:27] <%Dunmarkh> god this belt
[2:17:32] <%Dunmarkh> it long
[2:17:35] <%blastyoboots> every time an inserter moves it uses power yeah
[2:17:42] <skrewarrior> satisfaction is what really matters
[2:17:43] <BwdYeti> Bugs :soon:
[2:17:43] <%DiscoMatador> Now use coal belt to fuel Iron Furnaces
[2:17:44] <gslayer14> you also might want to put a box between the belt and the boiler
[2:17:44] <+LawOfTsunami> tomatoPog tomatoPog
[2:17:49] <amiavamp> they use power just by idling too
[2:17:52] <+YabbaTroll> you know what this game needs? man cannons
[2:17:58] <%blistexthief> Now that's a belt
[2:18:09] <+matt_mcgrump> tomatoSmile
[2:18:10] <kazadaz> the inserters are too efficient
[2:18:13] <%lumporr> bc the inserters
[2:18:13] <+Celarious> how can she slap?
[2:18:21] <BwdYeti> The inserters pulled the coal out too fast
[2:18:22] <huskarl_zap> filled up then stopped
[2:18:23] <spicystarbursts> Man this game looks like it needs environmental Terrorism. Avalanche needs to be a random encounter
[2:18:23] <bywayIdler> ...Huh, never thought to set coal drills like that before.
[2:18:24] <EvanDude47> too much taken out, but your replacing them
[2:18:26] <snivins> inserters take the fuel out too LUL
[2:18:33] <Griffin1171> use electronic miner
[2:18:33] <Dirksolomon> put electric miners there while at it
[2:18:33] <amiavamp> this isn't my beautiful mine! this isn't my beautiful design!
[2:18:35] <%blastyoboots> If you pull ALL the coal out of both sides at the same time when they're about to cycle over, they run out, yeah
[2:18:37] <%backfire_shot> pollution is the mark of a true gamer
[2:18:48] <Tisaric> you basically only use that burner  miner trick at the beginning to get personal use coal
[2:18:49] <%bassoontyphoon> my beautiful.... gone forever.... AUUUHH
[2:18:50] <sirtommygunn> you tried
[2:19:21] <kazadaz> Pat you can run on the conveyer belt to go fast
[2:19:21] <Shacklebox> you'll need like 2 more
[2:19:22] <Acicon> Waddup, Boivin
[2:19:33] <spicystarbursts> Stupid Thought: Where can I build my roller coasters and the Hot-Dog stand
[2:19:42] <%lumporr> middle click
[2:19:43] <Acicon> What if. Satisfactorio
[2:19:44] <%lumporr> to remove
[2:19:47] <EvanDude47> middle mouse click
[2:19:49] <Calek> middle click
[2:19:49] <BwdYeti> Middle click?
[2:19:55] <Expendamech> Middle mouse button
[2:20:09] <munitalprats> everything
[2:20:11] <gslayer14> more coal?
[2:20:13] <kazadaz> Remember: a full belt is a happy belt
[2:20:22] <Expendamech> Also, middle click on a blank spot to pre-set the hotkey.
[2:20:25] <Manwad> LUL
[2:20:30] <%DiscoMatador> What if more coal tho
[2:20:33] <%Alazull> "Coal-based Abominations" well I got a new steampunk idea
[2:20:35] <+Devildragon911> Shift click an item on the ground to make a planning ghost, so you know where you want to place stuff later :P
[2:20:35] <amiavamp> Electric miners have less pollution too. If your pollution drops the pollution cloud will shrink.
[2:20:39] <munitalprats> You'll still be burning coal for a lot of shit, pollution will forever be a problem
[2:20:40] <Shacklebox> that's the right attitude
[2:20:41] <%lumporr> might think about a gun turret or two for safety's sake
[2:20:46] <RunningNGunning> Moving from one coal based abomination to another
[2:20:55] <nauskills> Pat I just showed up just to say you're doing everything wrong okay bye
[2:20:56] <+Romuken> big sad, PSO2 corrupted and need to reinstall but download's at 4mbps.
[2:20:56] <%Mrbaconator> @kazadaz and one where you can't figure out how to fill both sides is an infuriating one till you jury rig some jank ass shit to fix it
[2:21:00] <%ChrisPlaysThing> "Oops, all Coal!"
[2:21:00] <kazadaz> CLEAN COAL
[2:21:01] <peanutdot007> But how will you make the cryptocoins without coal burning
[2:21:02] <%lumporr> @munitalprats i can't hear you over my solar panels and accumulators
[2:21:17] <BwdYeti> You should leave them running until your electric setup is running, so you have more resources if you need them
[2:21:24] <%blastyoboots> @PatStaresAt Since this is long-term freeplay you might want to build your furnaces a space apart each, because later BIG furnaces are 3x3 instead of 2x2
[2:21:24] <ShadeTheNovice> electric power which is based off of coal
[2:21:25] <munitalprats> @lumporr yes, because he has solar panels and will have solar panels very fast.
[2:21:44] <%lumporr> @munitalprats "forever be a problem"
[2:21:49] <+D00msDayDan> @blastyoboots or we could enjoy the meltdown as he has to tear down half his base to accommodate it
[2:21:50] <kazadaz> You're still burning tons of coal
[2:21:51] <%scallycap> @lumporr because accumulators are so fuckin loud
[2:21:54] <%bassoontyphoon> Is there a way to beat this game without destroying the environment??
[2:21:55] <BwdYeti> Pollution takes a long time to be absorbed
[2:22:03] <EvanDude47> protip: one boiler makes 200 steam per second, but a steam engine only consumes up to 100 steam per second, so 1 boiler can supply 2 steam engines
[2:22:11] <spicystarbursts> Can you plant trees to offset pollution?
[2:22:12] <Flakari> Pollution takes time to be absorbed and lessen
[2:22:15] <Expendamech> @PatStaresAt absorbed by trees, of which a desert has ... none.
[2:22:21] <amiavamp> @bassoontyphoon there is solar power later, and modules that reduce pollution
[2:22:21] <+D00msDayDan> @bassoontyphoon only by turning off pollution in world generation
[2:22:38] <%blastyoboots> you want a lab!
[2:22:41] <%bassoontyphoon> kk ty
[2:22:44] <snivins> research
[2:22:44] <%ArticPath> all the miners
[2:22:44] <munitalprats> its not just defense! its offense!
[2:22:45] <%Monkeyweed21> iron and cipper
[2:22:46] <+Devildragon911> Automate iron production, because you'll always want more iron
[2:22:49] <+b_aleph> much coal
[2:22:51] <amiavamp> @spicystarbursts only with mods
[2:22:52] <LoneFonte> turrets
[2:22:55] <%za7az> GUN
[2:22:57] <%Dunmarkh> shotgun
[2:23:05] <munitalprats> military gives you shotguns and submachinegun
[2:23:05] <sirtommygunn> get started on research
[2:23:05] <EvanDude47> under effects in the research menu
[2:23:13] <BlueLunecy> The shotgun fucks
[2:23:22] <%lumporr> 3rd in the list
[2:23:26] <amiavamp> you literally clicked right over it
[2:23:27] <Griffin1171> unlock it
[2:23:28] <+JobbedBone> if everyone enjoys something ironically, is it still cringe?
[2:23:29] <nauskills> 3rd
[2:23:31] <%blastyoboots> Could Gun Turret be in the GUN TURRET RESEARCH
[2:23:33] <%Dunmarkh> psaBlind
[2:23:33] <%ChrisPlaysThing> A Dyson sphere would probably be carbon neutral Kappa
[2:23:42] <%Monkeyweed21> psaBlind
[2:23:49] <LoneFonte> gotta make iron plates
[2:23:51] <amiavamp> @ChrisPlaysThing but what if it's a carbon star
[2:23:59] <+thegreenbenis> Gun
[2:24:00] <munitalprats> you can totally just wipe them out
[2:24:05] <BwdYeti> Don't use up all your iron on gun before you have iron production rebuilt, and end up running out
[2:24:08] <%ZegarWildheart> Finally subbed :) how’re we doing tonight. I’m usually asleep at this hour because of work but now i don’t cause i’m doing bits from home psaWhat
[2:24:09] <Manwad> red drank
[2:24:23] <Expendamech> time to hand craft 10 red science
[2:24:26] <+JobbedBone> I had no idea there was an on foot section
[2:24:27] <sirtommygunn> red fruit gushers
[2:24:29] <amiavamp> can do the early ones by hand e
[2:24:35] <%blastyoboots> research tab says how many reds you need
[2:24:37] <munitalprats> see how long it takes to make the red fruit gushers
[2:24:37] <EvanDude47> it says how much in the tech tree for each tech
[2:24:50] <kazadaz> iron helps you play
[2:24:50] <+thegreenbenis> Right-click lets you make 5 in a row.
[2:24:50] <%ChrisPlaysThing> @amiavamp So a big glowing diamond in space?
[2:25:00] <%ChrisPlaysThing> cus gravity pressure and all
[2:25:12] <amiavamp> @JobbedBone there's a "sandbox" game mode where you play without the player avatar and control like it's sim city but that's no fun lol
[2:25:15] <bywayIdler> AND how long each one takes.
[2:25:24] <%scallycap> nah
[2:25:26] <nauskills> Put it in a bos and shoot it
[2:25:28] <%lumporr> i'm fairly sure there is
[2:25:30] <duuupes> put it in a box and shoot it
[2:25:30] <+thegreenbenis> No.
[2:25:31] <A0N33> Put it in a wooden box then shoot the box
[2:25:31] <munitalprats> like, scrap it into parts?
[2:25:34] <+fancypan> put it in a chest and shoot it
[2:25:35] <Psyramics> put it in a box and shoot it
[2:25:35] <kazadaz> Put it in a chest and forget about it
[2:25:36] <+Devildragon911> To destroy something, place it in a box and shoot it with "C"
[2:25:36] <%scallycap> just throw it in a box
[2:25:39] <%ArticPath> put it in a box and shoot it
[2:25:41] <%blastyoboots> put it in a wooden chest and never think about it again (or shoot it with the C hotkey)
[2:25:42] <snivins> hoard it in the shame box
[2:25:43] <+Javaa01> Burninate it with a flamethrower
[2:25:43] <%lumporr> but usually i hide all my abominations in a wooden box hidden forever
[2:25:44] <+Onionchamp> nope once its built its built forever
[2:25:45] <+MarlooRedd> now Pat, your game is not an iron
[2:25:55] <Expendamech> @PatStaresAt if something should go wrong and get eaten, burners are your backup. hold onto them.
[2:25:57] <sirtommygunn> you can eventually get explosives to destroy the cliffs
[2:26:03] <amiavamp> @ChrisPlaysThing nah there's actual carbon stars, don't think they're dense or cool enough to form diamonds
[2:26:07] <reasonance> you can build more labs and split the science between them
[2:26:13] <EvanDude47> 10 red packs at 10 seconds each so 100 seconds to research gun turret
[2:26:13] <+JobbedBone> Pat do you remember Paul Bearer
[2:26:34] <munitalprats> t-thats a lot of iron
[2:26:35] <amiavamp> @ChrisPlaysThing density go down as star size go up and carbon stars are red giants
[2:26:54] <munitalprats> big iron for big boys
[2:26:55] <DrStinkers> Wow this satisfactory update took things in a weird direction
[2:26:55] <%lumporr> might need a new steam engine soon
[2:26:58] <+Devildragon911> It's a good idea to make your power coal supply mined by burner miners, that way if the something awful happens to you're power supply it'll continue to feed coal to the steam engine
[2:26:59] <nauskills> Not optimal 😠
[2:27:04] <kazadaz> You can build many labs and put science in all of them to research faster
[2:27:19] <%DiscoMatador> Put Furnaces by coal tube
[2:27:20] <snivins> dont put the furnaces over the ore LUL
[2:27:35] <+Romuken> GUN!
[2:27:36] <munitalprats> dont put furnaces over the ore
[2:27:56] <munitalprats> in fact ided put some of the drills on the other side of the belt
[2:28:09] <ISKMogul> put furnaces next to coal belt
[2:28:13] <%lumporr> ahh, centralized resource chains
[2:28:14] <%blastyoboots> a bit too close to the coal belt and you can't pull the iron plates out
[2:28:16] <%lumporr> my favorite fetish
[2:28:23] <nauskills> Also Pat you can put 2 different items on a belt, Coal and Iron for exemple so 1 inserter will feed both coal and iron
[2:28:41] <+thegreenbenis> @nauskills Someone taught him that earlier.
[2:28:55] <munitalprats> isnt all this coal going to the water though?
[2:28:58] <nauskills> @thegreenbenis Ah I see, I just came in LUL
[2:28:58] <10deez> Oh no
[2:29:02] <LoneFonte> uhhh
[2:29:03] <+thegreenbenis> @nauskills Never mind carry on. He is forgetful.
[2:29:03] <+Devildragon911> Oh no
[2:29:04] <%BestTeaMaker> LUL
[2:29:05] <%scallycap> bye bye iron
[2:29:05] <%ArticPath> Don't let iron go to the boiler
[2:29:07] <+JobbedBone> thats disgusting
[2:29:08] <+sulf> oh no
[2:29:08] <%blastyoboots> oh SHIT, putting iron ore on your power feed belt? brave!  it does still work
[2:29:08] <Expendamech> Deploy turrets on the steam engines before the western biters eat them.
[2:29:09] <ShadeTheNovice> monkaS
[2:29:09] <snivins> bye bye iron
[2:29:10] <%BestTeaMaker> chat shush
[2:29:11] <Calek> is the iron going to the boiler
[2:29:13] <%BestTeaMaker> let him learn
[2:29:14] <kazadaz> Pat youre feeding iron to the power plant
[2:29:16] <munitalprats> Irons going to the boiler
[2:29:18] <nauskills> Pat smart
[2:29:25] <%DiscoMatador> Ah yes sending iron to steam machine
[2:29:33] <slix3431> @PatStaresAt Hey Pat, as a fellow person with ocd. Would you reccomend this game to deal with cumpulsions?
[2:29:39] <+foomaster22> It will stop being stuck on coal eventually
[2:29:40] <ShadeTheNovice> oh man I cant wait for the speghetti that will come outta this
[2:29:40] <+thegreenbenis> Why does the boiler need iron pat?
[2:29:46] <Calek> this is a bold move cotton, let's see how it pays out
[2:29:48] <%Dunmarkh> LUL LUL
[2:29:49] <BwdYeti> Iron go to boiler LUL
[2:29:52] <ken_masters_son_of_sparda> yoooo what's uo
[2:29:58] <nauskills> DansGame
[2:30:04] <munitalprats> It will stop being stuck on coal eventually, and then coal will be stuck on iron
[2:30:08] <%blastyoboots> don't worry about sending iron to the boiler it won't clog it XD  --it's only a problem later when he wants a double coal belt, but by then he will have researched The Fancy Tools to deal with that like Splitters to split the coal belt~
[2:30:19] <+DrSmashy> iron: become steam psaWhat psaWhat psaWhat
[2:30:22] <%AzureGale> I, Ron
[2:30:23] <Garry_Guyface> Now to get the iron plates out and going somewhere
[2:30:29] <EvanDude47> why send iron to the coal belt instead of coal to an iron belt?
[2:30:29] <+Devildragon911> @slix3431 Factorio is great because the factory must always grow and it can always be more efficient!
[2:30:35] <munitalprats> alright but where are you gonna put the iron plates
[2:30:56] <kazadaz> You could fit another line of furnaces on the other side of the coal+iron belt
[2:30:59] <%blastyoboots> YES he learned the right-click-for-five hotkey!
[2:31:02] <munitalprats> i would have put the furnaces on the other side imo but either way this will work
[2:31:11] <%Jaxnos> ay, i see pat's taking less mind damage this time around, that's good
[2:31:16] <spicystarbursts> My only experience ina  factory was when I did a 3 month stint at a Dempsters Wrap factory. So All these recoursesa re begin translated into bread in my head
[2:31:22] <%lumporr> may want to separate iron from main coal belt because of wasted ore on the far side of the line but that's just me
[2:31:25] <+Devildragon911> Now load it into a box!
[2:31:31] <%lumporr> anyway i sleep now
[2:31:46] <kazadaz> he's beginning to believe...
[2:31:59] <nauskills> Iron go UP
[2:32:03] <%scallycap> @PatStaresAt once you get logistics you can use splitters to separate the i ron from the coal
[2:32:05] <+Devildragon911> The factory grows...
[2:32:14] <spicystarbursts> Like the end of the line is not packing the bread fast enough so pat had to build arms to take excess bread off the lines to make sandwiches
[2:32:19] <kazadaz> i am i-ron man
[2:32:24] <+sulf> start thinking about defense pat
[2:32:44] <kazadaz> yessss
[2:32:52] <+JobbedBone> brain like orb, no wrinkles BibleThump
[2:32:53] <sirtommygunn> oh no
[2:32:56] <%blastyoboots> YESSSS PAT LEARN THE THING
[2:32:56] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> How would you describe the fun you're having?
[2:33:03] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Iron for the boiler it's aaaawright
[2:33:07] <Expendamech> @PatStaresAt please place the turrets at the steam engine
[2:33:12] <LoneFonte> more water?
[2:33:18] <+StevenFC> I must PIPE MORE
[2:33:21] <+Devildragon911> Use burner inserters on the boilers, they'll continue to shovel coal even if you have a blackout!
[2:33:24] <spicystarbursts> I'm getting second hand stress just watching this
[2:33:24] <munitalprats> Either make turrets or go murder bugs
[2:33:31] <kazadaz> one burner can feed a chain of boilers btw
[2:33:34] <amiavamp> You'll want to stack more engines down beneath the first one
[2:33:36] <sirtommygunn> lay that pipe pat
[2:33:38] <+sulf> biters attack the source of the pollution so they will make a bee line for your steam engine and smelters
[2:33:44] <+StevenFC> Pat please we beg of you, Pipe MORE
[2:33:58] <DeltaPangaea> Gun also purple
[2:34:03] <%Monkeyweed21> turrets are facing wrong way
[2:34:04] <%Jaxnos> why is that chat screaming for pat's pipe?
[2:34:08] <BwdYeti> The bugs prioritize attacking things that produce pollution, so your turret emplacements will go around boilers, furnaces, assemblers, etc
[2:34:17] <munitalprats> Alright but what are you gonna research :^)
[2:34:17] <amiavamp> Turrets shoot in 360 degrees
[2:34:28] <%Dunmarkh> @Monkeyweed21 that doesn't matter, they're 360
[2:34:30] <%blastyoboots> @Monkeyweed21 they're rotating turrets dunkass
[2:34:38] <+sulf> if it spits out smoke = the biters hate it
[2:34:39] <amiavamp> Bugs also prioritize radars
[2:34:41] <%Dunmarkh> except flame turrets
[2:35:01] <%Tuna_Can_0> things that produce energy, radar, and you
[2:35:04] <%scallycap> bugs HATE radars
[2:35:08] <amiavamp> Bugs prioritize things that are shooting them too
[2:35:15] <+wizard_of_diamonds> You still want to point turrets in the direction you expect bugs to come in to cut down on rotaation time not firing right?
[2:35:15] <%blastyoboots> @Monkeyweed21 i'm sorry for saying dunkass i thought it would be funny because dunkass is a silly word but it sounded mean i apologize :(
[2:35:22] <kazadaz> Stoneminer 40K
[2:35:25] <+JobbedBone> wait until he sees robot orphanages LUL
[2:35:28] <amiavamp> so your turrets will pull aggro
[2:35:29] <+Devildragon911> How is pat going to get the copper to go on the same belt as his coal I wonder
[2:35:39] <%Monkeyweed21> @blastyoboots iz good I am dunkass ho
[2:35:50] <+sulf> wot
[2:35:51] <ShadeTheNovice> always need more wood dontcha?
[2:35:55] <%Dunmarkh> LUL LUL LUL LUL
[2:35:57] <%blastyoboots> @Wizard_of_diamonds the turrets stay pointing in the direction they last fired, there's no turning time either
[2:36:02] <%Dunmarkh> YOU REALIZE
[2:36:05] <%JoshManVGH> Ah ha
[2:36:07] <+Devildragon911> Pat, research splitters to solve the problem
[2:36:09] <EvanDude47> i think he figured out the iron problem
[2:36:11] <%Monkeyweed21> too muc iron
[2:36:11] <kazadaz> only 2.5 of your iron foundries are working rn
[2:36:14] <nauskills> Inserters won't pick up iron
[2:36:18] <+DJReViveAll> arm and a box is an easy fix
[2:36:21] <+wizard_of_diamonds> @blastyoboots Nice
[2:36:22] <BwdYeti> It can grab coal from both lanes, so your power isn't going to break
[2:36:23] <munitalprats> its logistics
[2:36:25] <Expendamech> IT'S FINE PAT, CALM DOWN. you need that much belt of iron for smelters anyways
[2:36:26] <LoneFonte> yeah
[2:36:27] <+b_aleph> LUL LUL LUL LUL
[2:36:27] <Manwad> yes
[2:36:28] <%scallycap> yes thats a splitter
[2:36:29] <+Devildragon911> Thats the one, logistics
[2:36:30] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Or don't take coal from your mixed line
[2:36:37] <amiavamp> It's fine
[2:36:41] <+foomaster22> Ya logistics has the splitters
[2:36:46] <einSynd> The unlocks are in the big box on the left of the research screen
[2:36:47] <EvanDude47> hover over the icons on the left in the reseach tab
[2:36:51] <BwdYeti> It's not going to break you're fine
[2:36:51] <%Dunmarkh> you'll get splitters and underground belts
[2:36:52] <sirtommygunn> Splitter and tunnels
[2:36:53] <nauskills> It's fine don't worry
[2:36:53] <%scallycap> it wont take the iron, youre good
[2:36:56] <kazadaz> no it's okay
[2:36:57] <munitalprats> nah it'll reach
[2:36:59] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt its actually fine it doesnt take from the iron
[2:37:00] <%blastyoboots> @PatStaresAt on the left side of research under "effects" it shows you EXACTLY which buildings you'll get from the research and you can hover over them, in the research tab.  also don't worry the boiler won't break
[2:37:02] <hardin360> Not going to break
[2:37:13] <Expendamech> Boilers only accept fuel items
[2:37:13] <nauskills> Inserters won't feed iron to boiler, it will only pick up coal
[2:37:19] <skrewarrior> it won't the sides of the belt are independent
[2:37:19] <+sulf> the inserter takes from both sides
[2:37:20] <sailercartridge> inserters are pretty smart
[2:37:23] <EvanDude47> in this game, splitters are also combiners
[2:37:25] <amiavamp> Inserters won't do things that gunk up your buildings
[2:37:27] <sirtommygunn> the arms are smart enough to not feed bad material into machines
[2:37:30] <snivins> yeah is not critical
[2:37:35] <LVL1_Scumbag> It
[2:37:46] <+Devildragon911> You're still gonna want those logistics though lol
[2:37:48] <kazadaz> In the long run, half a belt of coal won't be enough to supply your power needs, but you're good for the time being
[2:38:02] <munitalprats> Stone isnt as important right now outside of specific construction
[2:38:08] <%blastyoboots> need more red research vials made by hand
[2:38:16] <LVL1_Scumbag> but walls
[2:38:20] <spicystarbursts> Do all the resources have to be pooled to the same conveyer belt that leads to the...river device?
[2:38:21] <amiavamp> copper go up
[2:38:25] <munitalprats> fuck walls
[2:38:25] <LoneFonte> could also make another one for brinks
[2:38:36] <+sulf> has this game autosaved yet?
[2:38:46] <munitalprats> just murder everything so you wont need walls :^)
[2:38:50] <ittla> ah factorio, I remember when I lost an entire week to this game
[2:38:53] <LVL1_Scumbag> But factory fortress
[2:38:55] <Expendamech> uhhhh @sulf
[2:38:55] <amiavamp> @spicystarbursts nah, it's just the boiler part needs fuel (the coal) and the coal is really far away
[2:39:08] <kazadaz> Second coal line
[2:39:10] <munitalprats> Pat has realized
[2:39:12] <+Devildragon911> Pat, logistics pat, use the splitters...
[2:39:15] <+sulf> pat please save your game
[2:39:19] <$OranHexthief> research splitter now\
[2:39:27] <spicystarbursts> OK, it just looks like that belt is clogged up
[2:39:27] <+b_aleph> make a circle out of that belt
[2:39:33] <munitalprats> Dont need a splitter, just need a second coal line
[2:39:37] <+thehotrefrigerator> You your big, strong brain Pat!
[2:39:48] <%blastyoboots> @PatStaresAt just do the research by hand so you have splitters and underground belts to do this. or craft the research vials by hand i mean, so you can make a Sensible Layout
[2:39:50] <kazadaz> Make a T intersection
[2:39:51] <nauskills> Put belt in a T shape
[2:39:53] <amiavamp> ! Belt Poisoned !
[2:39:55] <+sulf> you had the right idea
[2:39:56] <+b_aleph> LUL LUL LUL
[2:39:58] <munitalprats> gotta make a T
[2:39:59] <+ledgefiendd> how's factorio pat? This game always looked cool
[2:40:03] <Psyramics> put one belt going down just above it
[2:40:05] <Laioken13> a scuffed splitter. i love it
[2:40:05] <bywayIdler> Imagine NOT just walling off your factory and lining it with turrets.
[2:40:11] <nauskills> Clap
[2:40:20] <amiavamp> Underground belts have an oddity like that too where they can be used to block input from one side
[2:40:22] <fidget_exclamation_mark> inserters are the wrong way around
[2:40:24] <kazadaz> ~~just factorio things~~
[2:40:26] <+sulf> splitters are wrong way
[2:40:29] <Calek> @bywayIdler don't need to wall if you proactively seek out enemy bases and wipe them out
[2:40:39] <%TheBensonator_> Belts out here T-posing on the nonbelievers
[2:40:44] <%blastyoboots> @PatStaresAt yes it feels weird but you must become a black belt at Belt-Fu. you will learn all the tricks to quickly adjust or meld belt siding, especially now that Splitters are coming
[2:40:57] <fidget_exclamation_mark> fyi you can copy-paste settings on inserts, so you can rotate one inserter and copy the directions to all the rest pretty painlessly
[2:41:03] <+JobbedBone> we're teaching you to be sub-optimal on purpose :)
[2:41:06] <Expendamech> @PatStaresAt Now might be a good time to save the game if you haven't yet... And turn on autosaves.
[2:41:12] <rafaelba93> arms only place itens on the far lane on tge belt
[2:41:13] <qwazzeon> The biters are gonna come at you one way or another, even if you try to keep their population in check.
[2:41:14] <remagjaw> ..... Isn't this a fancy 3d game?
[2:41:26] <spicystarbursts> the non-cheery music background is very suitable for this factory nightmare
[2:41:29] <munitalprats> "oh no my pollution!". Also Pat: THESE TREES GOTTA GO!
[2:41:32] <+Devildragon911> If autosave isn't on... why are there 3 autosaves?
[2:41:34] <amiavamp> autosave interval is on
[2:41:34] <Flakari> It's every 5 minutes
[2:41:35] <+sulf> oh it is, its just so fast we cant see it work
[2:41:35] <DeltaPangaea> You could make an eye-ron box
[2:41:36] <%DrBunni> the best way to get rid of trees is shot gun
[2:41:50] <spicystarbursts> BUT NOT ON YOURSELF
[2:41:52] <nauskills> Paige want to become orb
[2:41:53] <LVL1_Scumbag> Automate her workout
[2:41:57] <Expendamech> LUL
[2:41:57] <BoneofMalkav> LUL
[2:41:58] <%Monkeyweed21> Can we start calling Pat "pollution daddy"
[2:41:59] <$Dakuu75> I thought he would point at chat
[2:42:00] <ShadeTheNovice> it was there in Other
[2:42:03] <%walternatorz> just tell her you'll stop loving her
[2:42:06] <+JobbedBone> orb just isn't your look, peach
[2:42:08] <qwazzeon> Thanks, Mr. Pat-please-save oneguy.
[2:42:09] <EvanDude47> @remagjaw satisfactory is the 3d version of factorio that pat also played some on stream
[2:42:11] <+Devildragon911> Pat, auto save is already on, you have 3 autosaves already
[2:42:12] <+FlappySeal_> Zangief is a life goal
[2:42:23] <+StevenFC> When you don't workout for a week your bones disintegrate in to a dog.
[2:42:24] <SaltyAzteca> oh she said the thing yaaaaa Kappa
[2:42:26] <spicystarbursts> Paige, if you get an Orb, you're back might break
[2:42:30] <bywayIdler> @Calek Yeah, but if I do THAT, how am I going to stand behind my wall and enjoy watching my turrets chew up a swarm?
[2:42:32] <Expendamech> ok good autosave is 5 minute intervals
[2:42:32] <remagjaw> @EvanDude47 Aaahh, thank you!
[2:42:36] <%blastyoboots> autosave is on, why would it not be on?  also yeah Factorio doesn't break up your saves By Game like Satisfactory does, that was an innovation Satisfactory made, so you have to use naming conventions for different games.
[2:42:39] <$Dakuu75> bow-chica-wow-wow
[2:42:51] <+JobbedBone> get pat a birdbath LUL
[2:42:52] <ittla> does peach grip a spoon with the whole fist
[2:42:53] <kazadaz> Next step is to automate Red Science production
[2:42:57] <Calek> @bywayIdler quite the conundrum
[2:42:58] <amiavamp> automation go up
[2:43:02] <BoneofMalkav> One Box, Two Box, Red Box, Blue Box
[2:43:11] <%Monkeyweed21> pat research
[2:43:12] <BallisticMeerkat> iron box would be better to store on mass with
[2:43:14] <+Devildragon911> Now I know how my driving instructed must have felt watching me learn to drive...
[2:43:16] <Expendamech> it was a hard lesson to learn when you started factorio in the early days and autosave on wasn't default.
[2:43:19] <munitalprats> man that cliff is annoying lol
[2:43:28] <+thehotrefrigerator> Pat: *Shakes belly* Paige: "Jokes on you I'm into that!"
[2:43:36] <+FlappySeal_> Used to be Epic Games
[2:43:36] <amiavamp> Assemblers make almost everything
[2:43:40] <oozebear> cliffy b makes gears, silly
[2:43:40] <BwdYeti> You can craft most of the things in the game by yourself
[2:43:41] <munitalprats> You can make a lot of things by yourself, assembly machines just do it for you.
[2:43:42] <nauskills> Elmo
[2:43:43] <@SSaryn> sipsipElmo sipsipElmo sipsipElmo
[2:43:43] <LVL1_Scumbag> Need research
[2:43:49] <pth88> Yesterday was pretty rough huh
[2:43:52] <DrStinkers> he jump
[2:44:05] <kazadaz> they can even make more assemblers...
[2:44:07] <$BuoyantSoul> Elmo here to save the factory
[2:44:11] <remagjaw> remagjaw is gifting 1 Tier 1 Subs to PatStaresAt's community! They've gifted a total of 1 in the channel! 
[2:44:12] <remagjaw> remagjaw gifted a Tier 1 sub to dkthefriend! 
[2:44:14] <nauskills> I'll take 10 science pls
[2:44:18] <munitalprats> yes
[2:44:19] <+sulf> yeah
[2:44:20] <GunEden> assemblers to make more assemblers
[2:44:21] <%blastyoboots> YEP
[2:44:22] <Psyramics> yup
[2:44:22] <%scallycap> lol yep
[2:44:23] <Flakari> Of course they can
[2:44:25] <Calek> of course they cna
[2:44:25] <@SSaryn> Why wouldn't they, they assemble ez
[2:44:27] <LVL1_Scumbag> yep
[2:44:27] <A0N33> Yup yup
[2:44:27] <+Devildragon911> You know what would be really kl, if your factory made those sciences for you
[2:44:27] <oozebear> INFINITE ASSEMBLY
[2:44:30] <amiavamp> In this game, buildings are items, instead of putting and pulling resources when you craft them
[2:44:31] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> What if you need a whole lot of them?
[2:44:31] <remagjaw> YOU CANT GIFT IT TO A PERSON?!
[2:44:35] <%marsantas> Yeah you can make a little section of stuff that makes all the stuff that makes stuff
[2:44:36] <%toxinjustin> toxinjustin subscribed with Prime. 
[2:44:37] <+D00msDayDan> unlimited assembly works
[2:44:38] <+FlappySeal_> Assemblers become the key to borderline everything in time
[2:44:39] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Oho, you ain't seen nothing yet
[2:44:40] <+Celarious> Pat EVERYTHING can be automated in this game
[2:44:41] <GunEden> you think that
[2:44:43] <%Dunmarkh> gray goo time
[2:44:45] <%Livelinne> psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp
[2:44:46] <Psyramics> so fix it
[2:44:48] <Calek> you'll appreciate it in the future
[2:44:48] <sirtommygunn> Pats mind has split open with that revelation
[2:44:50] <BoneofMalkav> Assemblers Assembling a self-sustaining economy for itself LUL
[2:44:52] <BwdYeti> Need a splitter
[2:44:53] <LVL1_Scumbag> So do it better
[2:44:54] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> You can automate ANYTHING, it's just whether you think it's worth automating
[2:44:56] <munitalprats> This is why i just make coal belts for each thing
[2:44:56] <%scallycap> i always put iron and coal on separate belts and use long inserters to grab em
[2:44:59] <rafaelba93> separate, its way easier to handle
[2:45:01] <remagjaw> DAMIT.
[2:45:02] <snivins> research the splitter it will fix everything
[2:45:03] <einSynd> Not much you can do until red inserters
[2:45:06] <ShadeTheNovice> it was about time
[2:45:07] <Expendamech> You'll need a lot more than 5 furnaces soon Pat, just roll with it
[2:45:07] <skrewarrior> the game can be beaten with less than 100 hand crafts
[2:45:09] <peanutdot007> Ger splitters
[2:45:10] <amiavamp> This game has mods to automate crafting items to put into a connected Minecraft or Kerbal Space Program server
[2:45:12] <%blastyoboots> @PatStaresAt if you want it unlinked, handcraft a bunch more red science cause you now need some SPLITTERS~
[2:45:15] <+D00msDayDan> there's an achievement for beating the game with only hand crafting less than 111 items, the absolute minimum it takes to hit automation and an assembler is 103
[2:45:16] <BallisticMeerkat> its better so it's future proof for expantion pat
[2:45:16] <munitalprats> yeah i used long inserters.
[2:45:18] <+sulf> jesus zangief :D
[2:45:29] <+Devildragon911> pat... the splitter... you must research logistics pat...
[2:45:31] <LoneFonte> use F, it's easier
[2:45:31] <+foomaster22> You can just hold F to pick stuff up
[2:45:36] <%Livelinne> I'm just here to hear the delightful snoring psaDogchamp
[2:45:44] <amiavamp> fuck them trees
[2:45:44] <Expendamech> i think he wants the belt moved north
[2:45:45] <$TheDrugWeCallWifi> Highly recommend logistics
[2:45:46] <kazadaz> Later on you'll unlock longer robo-arms, but for now you've gotta use mixed belts
[2:45:58] <LVL1_Scumbag> fuk u nature
[2:46:06] <munitalprats> this is why i just seperated my coal belts and used long inserters, even if it wasnt optimal
[2:46:07] <+Edrem> splitters also allow you to filter a belt
[2:46:13] <amiavamp> theres an achievement for burning trees
[2:46:18] <%walternatorz> it's been awhile since anti-earth day Pat has made an appearance
[2:46:22] <+foomaster22> Is the dog snoring?
[2:46:25] <spicystarbursts> IS PAts stomach growling?
[2:46:29] <munitalprats> splitters are basically belt filters though.
[2:46:40] <@SSaryn> Tree must die for Planet and Bug death
[2:46:49] <remagjaw> Pollution daddy at it again. Just hope captain planet doesn't swing by...
[2:46:53] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Dogs with short snouts make big snores
[2:46:54] <%blastyoboots> @PatStaresAt if something is out of range but you want to mark it on the map, you can zoom in and shift click to build a Ghost of the building or belt(s) to transparently mark where you want to build it later
[2:47:00] <qwazzeon> Man, I'm so used to using the modded-in loaders that I forgot how awful inserters are.
[2:47:01] <+Devildragon911> that's not snoring. that's the sound of the bugs slowly coming to kill him
[2:47:02] <munitalprats> lets make GUN!
[2:47:09] <peanutdot007> Yeah prepare for that to happen a lot. Blackouts fuck you in this game
[2:47:19] <kazadaz> You can use robo-arms to jerry rig a splitter, it's less efficient but it works early-game
[2:47:23] <munitalprats> Kill bug
[2:47:23] <%DrBunni> give yourself a break, you're new to this overlycomplex game.
[2:47:24] <+sulf> 2:1 ratio, 2 engines to 1 boiler
[2:47:25] <%Monkeyweed21> pat research
[2:47:31] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Set it up so coal actually goes into the steam thing again>
[2:47:33] <+FlappySeal_> "Let's build more Steam" - Gabe Newell 2021
[2:47:33] <nauskills> 1 boiler can support 2 steam engines
[2:47:48] <amiavamp> Connect it directly to the bottom
[2:47:48] <munitalprats> chain them
[2:47:49] <%keye90> JFC the snores haha
[2:47:52] <kazadaz> Connect blue to blue
[2:47:52] <%blastyoboots> holy shit that GEIF is upping his SNORE TECH
[2:47:55] <BwdYeti> Remember, engines can go in line with each other
[2:47:58] <+Devildragon911> they can hock up from the bottom pat
[2:47:58] <einSynd> Engines can touch butts
[2:48:00] <qwazzeon> And 20 boilers to one water pipe, if that ratio hasn't changed
[2:48:02] <Rigelz01> is that Zangief snoring?
[2:48:17] <skrewarrior> 1 pump can support 20 boilers
[2:48:17] <rafaelba93> engine line for each boiler
[2:48:19] <fidget_exclamation_mark> you can daisy chain steam engines
[2:48:19] <BoneofMalkav> "Why build just one Steam, when we can build a whole Linux Distro from just Steam" GabeN
[2:48:24] <spicystarbursts> I thought PAT bought some fancy mike system to mute out background noise/Snoring?
[2:48:29] <nauskills> clap
[2:48:31] <@SSaryn> If you hear snoring, usually Zangief.
[2:48:34] <%scallycap> LUL
[2:48:36] <%AzureGale> That's hawt
[2:48:38] <kazadaz> that, THAT was the message that got through
[2:48:38] <oozebear> they call that a moon landing
[2:48:47] <EvanDude47> 1 boiler generates enough steam for 2 engines
[2:48:47] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> One boiler, two engines.
[2:48:48] <BwdYeti> It'll work
[2:48:49] <+sulf> 1 space between the boiler for a water pipe
[2:48:52] <+Devildragon911> oh god, i don't have the patience for this >.<
[2:48:53] <%blastyoboots> boilers can touch dicks too!
[2:48:55] <LoneFonte> needs pipe
[2:48:58] <kazadaz> hell YEAHHHH
[2:49:06] <rafaelba93> turn it
[2:49:09] <%Jaxnos> he's FEELING IT
[2:49:09] <+sulf> no room, u need 1 unit of space
[2:49:10] <munitalprats> HE'S BEGINNING TO BELIEVE
[2:49:11] <Expendamech> the boiler does pass water to its neighbor
[2:49:13] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Pat, use Q to clone buildings your mouse is over.
[2:49:18] <BwdYeti> You have to move the turret and poles
[2:49:24] <%blastyoboots> your ass is in the way
[2:49:27] <nauskills> Pole in way
[2:49:28] <amiavamp> power line is in the way
[2:49:32] <munitalprats> electric in way
[2:49:44] <ShadeTheNovice> electric pole in way
[2:49:47] <winner_92> why no work good
[2:49:47] <h8t0r_m4rs> a pole is in the way
[2:49:49] <+tergvelo> You put a pole in the way
[2:49:49] <%Monkeyweed21> pole in the way
[2:49:52] <@SSaryn> Pat, THE POLE.
[2:49:52] <Valentinius_Anodyne> The pole, my man
[2:49:52] <EvanDude47> powerline in the spot

[2:50:11] <sirtommygunn> the pole in front of the boiler
[2:50:12] <+Devildragon911> I'm gonna come back in like 20 hours when he's learnt the basics of assemblers, chow
[2:50:16] <+b_aleph> Make them 1 space apart dumbdumb
[2:50:22] <@SSaryn> psaBlind psaBlind psaBlind
[2:50:25] <kazadaz> Pollution go up
[2:50:29] <munitalprats> Biters gonna roll up eventually
[2:50:39] <+DeaconBluesClues> hey...did Pat lose weight? it looks like he lost weight.
[2:50:43] <Calek> I'd put a pipe inbetween the boilers, have one row of poles powering both rows of steam engines
[2:50:47] <+tergvelo> @Devildragon911 lol you assume learning
[2:50:49] <HeWhoMonologues> Alright, so where are we now?
[2:50:56] <nauskills> Pat smart
[2:51:07] <amiavamp> steam go choo choo
[2:51:11] <+tergvelo> I'm here for the spaghett
[2:51:15] <BoneofMalkav> It's Gura planting those giant trees in minecraft all over again LUL
[2:51:17] <%blastyoboots> @kazadaz true, but building more steam generators doesn't create the extra pollution right AWAY, the pollution is driven by coal actually consumed which is driven by power consumption
[2:51:19] <Expendamech> @HeWhoMonologues about to get munched by biters to the west
[2:51:19] <sirtommygunn> pollution go UP
[2:51:30] <amiavamp> treat your labs like the space ladder, get a good spot to keep them and feed resources to them
[2:51:30] <nauskills> coal gone
[2:51:33] <+D00msDayDan> @BoneofMalkav but 2x2 cease to be
[2:51:35] <munitalprats> MIND GOBLINS START NOW
[2:51:36] <BwdYeti> Splitter or arm off the main coal line
[2:51:37] <%scallycap> put the coal on the iron line?
[2:51:37] <+sulf> with ur research u get long inserters
[2:51:39] <kazadaz> You can use robo arms as a jerry rigged splitter
[2:51:39] <skrewarrior> splitter
[2:51:40] <HeWhoMonologues> @Expendamech I arrived just in time then.
[2:51:41] <h8t0r_m4rs> split
[2:51:43] <DudeDern> !uptime
[2:51:43] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 52m.
[2:51:47] <EvanDude47> splitter on the main coal track
[2:51:48] <%blastyoboots> @PatStaresAt RESEARCH SPLITTERS QUICK
[2:51:50] <LoneFonte> the noises LUL
[2:51:53] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Long armed inserters?
[2:52:00] <xeros720> pat coal good
[2:52:04] <munitalprats> Oh god this is hilarious
[2:52:06] <nauskills> Inserters will put item on the furthest side of the belt
[2:52:07] <%Jaxnos> oh no
[2:52:09] <+tergvelo> oop, yet to learn sides of the belt
[2:52:20] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Long inserters can grab them directly from the top conveyor to the smelters, if you move belt down by 1
[2:52:20] <BwdYeti> Inserters onto belts place the item on the far side of the belt, that coal will go on the iron
[2:52:21] <h8t0r_m4rs> not gonna work
[2:52:22] <sirtommygunn> nope
[2:52:26] <%blastyoboots> @PatStaresAt that won't work, inserters ALWAYS place on the FAR side of the belt they're reaching for, NOT the close side.
[2:52:29] <munitalprats> Inserters always put on the far side
[2:52:29] <kazadaz> No room on belt
[2:52:32] <Calek> space full
[2:52:32] <amiavamp> bc the devs thought inserters putting on the opposite side of the belt was funny and intuitive
[2:52:36] <+sulf> u got the right idea but do it from the right side onto a belt that intersects
[2:52:38] <$TheDrugWeCallWifi> God I forgot just how many mechanics there are to even the SIMPLEST thing in this game LUL
[2:52:39] <EvanDude47> an inserter will always place its item on the far side of a belt
[2:52:39] <bywayIdler> That's why I usually jusr have cInserters put on the belt's far side.
[2:52:41] <+tergvelo> IGNORE CHAT - MAKE YOUR UNIQUE SPAGHET
[2:52:42] <Dirksolomon> You are placing coal on the same line as the iron
[2:52:43] <ShadeTheNovice> they put on the far end of the belt
[2:52:49] <sirtommygunn> oh he kind of got it to work by making them pass to each other
[2:53:01] <winner_92> man, this is some shit
[2:53:05] <Dirksolomon> inserters always put the stuff on the other side of the belt, not closest to them
[2:53:06] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Does he have long inserters?
[2:53:08] <%scallycap> internets put shit on the opposite side of the belt
[2:53:10] <kazadaz> The far end of the belt is full of iron ore
[2:53:11] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Roasted_Pheasant subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 31 months, currently on a 10 month streak! So when the creativity sim has right answers, it doesn't trigger goblins?
[2:53:16] <hardin360> Have an inserter pulling from the coal onto a belt that intersects the iron.
[2:53:17] <+sulf> u need to place it on the right side of the belt so if u do it from the right side it works
[2:53:19] <munitalprats> either research logistics and make splitters or get long-armed inserters
[2:53:28] <%Jaxnos> yeah, you're breaking it
[2:53:28] <LoneFonte> @Spudnacious_Dynasty when he finishes that research
[2:53:30] <amiavamp> you need splitters to make it work
[2:53:31] <+b_aleph> why are there 2 furnaces offline?
[2:53:32] <nauskills> Pat broke belt
[2:53:34] <+D00msDayDan> inserters inserting onto a belt drop it on the far side, which right now is full of iron ore
[2:53:37] <EvanDude47> inserters drop items on the far side
[2:53:40] <munitalprats> HERE COME THE MIND GOBLINS
[2:53:45] <LVL1_Scumbag> The goblins are growing stronger
[2:53:51] <GunEden> reset?
[2:53:51] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> New world
[2:53:51] <%AzureGale> Pat just ran. He ran so far away
[2:53:52] <sirtommygunn> pat please just research automation
[2:53:53] <+Romuken> don't run, only embrace
[2:53:53] <+keris90> Inserters put it on the far end of the belt from the inserter
[2:53:57] <+tergvelo> Wait, he got smelting right for copper...
[2:53:58] <kazadaz> You can change the iron belt so that the iron ore goes on the other side
[2:53:59] <CaptainDonk> Just tee it off again
[2:54:00] <winner_92> i mustn't run away i mustn't run away i mustn't run away i mustn't run away
[2:54:01] <sailercartridge> see the plate output how the inserters are only using one side
[2:54:01] <oozebear> just run patrick. live in the forest and be a true goblin
[2:54:02] <h8t0r_m4rs> do a T wit belts where the iron is turning and one side for iron and the other for coal
[2:54:03] <Expendamech> Belts with two sides might be too much for him.
[2:54:03] <rafaelba93> a lot of more stuff can go wrong in this one
[2:54:03] <spicystarbursts> Go back to play Satisfactory, it sounded like he had more fun with that one?
[2:54:05] <ShadeTheNovice> dont let it set in
[2:54:06] <%Crookedspiral> psaGoblin
[2:54:09] <skrewarrior> this factory runs on goblin power
[2:54:10] <$RealThiele> balls laboratory
[2:54:10] <SirDogBear> Satisfactory - Sim City Version PogChamp
[2:54:15] <nauskills> It's not
[2:54:15] <+sulf> from the right side inserter off the coal put it onto a belt and then feed it into the RIGHT side
[2:54:18] <%scallycap> eventually everything runs on electricity
[2:54:18] <%blastyoboots> Inserters ALWAYS put on the far side of the belt, so when you have an inserter north of a belt, it puts it on the south side.  you have to use the inserters to place on a DIFFERENT belt and merge it strategically with the iron belt, OR, just handcraft red research and build some splitters
[2:54:18] <kazadaz> Yeah you get electricc burners later
[2:54:20] <munitalprats> I just made multiple lines of coal
[2:54:21] <+tergvelo> @PatStaresAt  Not wrong.
[2:54:21] <hardin360> It's really not...
[2:54:22] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> It's easier when you have more things to move stuff with
[2:54:24] <BwdYeti> It gets a lot easier when you have splitters (and underground belts)
[2:54:24] <amiavamp> When you get long-armed inserters you can have 2 belts on 1 side
[2:54:28] <LVL1_Scumbag> Only until you have logistics
[2:54:30] <+b_aleph> BECAUSE YOU HAS NO LOGISTICS!!!
[2:54:31] <GunEden> it gets easier when you research electricity
[2:54:36] <$TheDrugWeCallWifi> Splitters will help immensely
[2:54:38] <+fancypan> Just research electric burners 5head
[2:54:41] <Dirksolomon> With logistics you should be able to long arm them off further belt. Or combine the belts for now
[2:54:43] <%MelBrooksKA> Electric furnace is fun
[2:54:46] <+D00msDayDan> hand fill furnaces with fuel until you have the means to get fancy
[2:54:47] <ShadeTheNovice> electric stuff makes that almost trivial later on
[2:54:49] <%Monkeyweed21> you need belt splitters @PatStaresAt
[2:54:52] <OldPaleDrake> Pat your dog sounds like someone squeegeeing a window badly
[2:54:57] <munitalprats> Longhanded inserters are good for you right now
[2:54:59] <CappuccinoGuil> Having to worry about Fuel plus Energy for structures sounds like a pain
[2:55:01] <sirtommygunn> technology will slowly solve all your problems
[2:55:03] <LoneFonte> yeah, just rush those researchs for new options
[2:55:04] <+tergvelo> Please tell me he's playing on peaceful??
[2:55:05] <Calek> splitters are rad
[2:55:06] <amiavamp> splitter is so complicated in this
[2:55:13] <nauskills> Splitters split an item into 2 belts
[2:55:18] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Splitter very useful, probably a good solution to your coal problem
[2:55:19] <munitalprats> Splitters or Long-handed inserters are what you want rn
[2:55:19] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Long inserters can fix your coal problem. Move coal belt down one and they can feed your steel smelters.
[2:55:32] <SirDogBear> Science is nice, but have you head about this thing called MAGIC?! PogChamp
[2:55:38] <invalid_robin> I play on peaceful lol
[2:55:39] <munitalprats> Peaceful is for COWARDS
[2:55:47] <+tergvelo> Oh. Well this will be fun
[2:55:47] <thehullowed> !uptime
[2:55:48] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 56m.
[2:55:52] <amiavamp> but this science is magic, how else is he fitting 100000 items in his pocket?
[2:56:04] <%blastyoboots> @PatStaresAt I know you're probably going to play more Satisfactory than this at first, but how are you liking this game? Do you think you'll eventually be pouring hours into it?
[2:56:08] <Shacklebox> You're fine pat
[2:56:11] <Baconrath> dnoGEESE_BE
[2:56:13] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> It has so much stuff.
[2:56:16] <munitalprats> You're doing great
[2:56:20] <Expendamech> @PatStaresAt maybe with your newly researched assemblers it's time to make automated ammo production Kappa
[2:56:23] <+tergvelo> @PatStaresAt sorry to unintentionally insult you. THE FACTORY MUST GROW
[2:56:23] <%Mrbaconator> it got a lot of stuff
[2:56:23] <cochramd1992> oh boy wait until you get into Dwarf Fortress
[2:56:24] <LVL1_Scumbag> oh yeah
[2:56:27] <kazadaz> This game ran so Satisfactory would also run
[2:56:30] <%Dunmarkh> you're doing good kid
[2:56:31] <nauskills> I like Peaceful, cause bitters uses UPS and once you go into megabases you want every bit of CPU power you want
[2:56:31] <+Celarious> This game can get so much crazier
[2:56:34] <BwdYeti> It's very much the hardcore one of these games, there's a ton of depth in here
[2:56:35] <+b_aleph> FAST GOOD
[2:56:36] <bywayIdler> @amiavamp The power of INDUSTRY.
[2:56:36] <%scallycap> isnt it nice that it automatically makes the components for you?
[2:56:38] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat, you will ALWAYS be polluting
[2:56:41] <%Monkeyweed21> belts carrying 2 things instead of 1 is a BIG change
[2:56:41] <sirtommygunn> Yeah it's not very new player friendly
[2:56:43] <+Romuken> he's learning!
[2:56:44] <cochramd1992> you want tot talk about learning curves
[2:56:45] <GunEden> expansion is faster in factiorio
[2:56:46] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Peaceful is indeed for cowards, but cowardice is perfectly valid too
[2:56:47] <munitalprats> You'll deal with EVERYTHING later
[2:56:47] <+foomaster22> It is also much better looking :)
[2:57:00] <Calek> @scallycap going from dyson sphere program to this made that feature feel so good
[2:57:04] <%AncelDeLambert> trees are VERY slow in their pollution absorbtion. They also can't be grown or replaced, fyi
[2:57:05] <HeWhoMonologues> Cheer500 Hopefully the initial stress is giving way to fun.
[2:57:07] <munitalprats> all the bugs must go, pat.
[2:57:07] <SirDogBear> it has the superior sim city view also, all it needs are epic nintendo add ons like Mario Statues CorgiDerp
[2:57:10] <rafaelba93> yep, but when it clicks it fucking CLICKS
[2:57:12] <+tergvelo> How much backseat gaming is acceptable?
[2:57:15] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Wait till he learns about buses.
[2:57:15] <amiavamp> The water is absorbing the pollution for the biter nest in the north
[2:57:17] <IntrepidEye> It doesn't get extreme until the liquids come into play
[2:57:17] <spicystarbursts> I'm guessing theres no wind in this game? Pollution just seems to bloom outwards evenly
[2:57:17] <tanarath> Can Pat plant trees?
[2:57:30] <%Dunmarkh> nope
[2:57:36] <+tergvelo> because I feel the need to help, but I won't do it against your wishes
[2:57:36] <HeWhoMonologues> @tergvelo In this chat? All of it.
[2:57:43] <%blastyoboots> @tergvelo as much as you want, he's really good at ignoring it strategically and getting a general chat consensus
[2:57:43] <hardin360> Two of your furnaces are non functional do to the speed of your crate inserter.
[2:57:48] <+DeaconBluesClues> NOT ENUFF BULLIT
[2:57:50] <kazadaz> Hey pat, you can set up some assemblers and automate your Red science production
[2:57:55] <+b_aleph> protect your coal as well
[2:57:59] <winner_92> bullet go up
[2:58:02] <Shacklebox> You only need 1 turret
[2:58:06] <SirDogBear> The key to Logistics is to understand how a large corporation can pay its workers nothing and message it like they care LUL
[2:58:08] <%darklordfodder> Better than I did my first week playing.
[2:58:12] <skrewarrior> right click splits in half
[2:58:18] <munitalprats> but gun though.
[2:58:23] <Valentinius_Anodyne> A good attitude to have
[2:58:24] <%Dunmarkh> good point
[2:58:25] <@SSaryn> What if gun
[2:58:26] <winner_92> well now that you put it like that
[2:58:28] <%blistexthief> No such thing as too much bullet
[2:58:29] <+D00msDayDan> One Guy is lying, you need MANY turrets
[2:58:30] <HeWhoMonologues> Do turrets cost bullets?
[2:58:31] <sirtommygunn> I don't think there's a way to split besides halving
[2:58:33] <snivins> you need more ,always more so you can pollute free
[2:58:35] <amiavamp> "you only need 1 turret" biter in chat
[2:58:36] <nauskills> What's wrong with more Gun?
[2:58:38] <+b_aleph> what if god said no turret?
[2:58:40] <%baka_sugoi> B U T T gun
[2:58:41] <%Blackmage9999> psaGoblin psaGoblin
[2:58:46] <Calek> you'd be surprised
[2:58:47] <kazadaz> oh yes it can
[2:58:48] <munitalprats> Turrets use exclusively bullets  @HeWhoMonologues but they dont use power
[2:58:49] <%blastyoboots> @HeWhoMonologues oh yes they do need bullet
[2:58:50] <LVL1_Scumbag> yet
[2:58:53] <LoneFonte> one biter LUL
[2:58:56] <+tergvelo> Yes, the steam power is un-fuckable
[2:58:57] <%NopeBadguy> are you being fucked with
[2:58:57] <@SSaryn> You'll be fucked with anyway but that'll come.
[2:58:59] <spicystarbursts> Question: Is this considered a small map? Like Pats factory already take up a good chunk of the mini-map
[2:58:59] <%AzureGale> How am I gonna stop some big mean Mother-Hubbard from tearin' me a structurally superfluous new behind? The answer? Use a gun. And if that don't work, use more gun.
[2:59:03] <+spiceyweasle> There is always the Bob’s angels mod that takes the base game times 20
[2:59:04] <sailercartridge> walls will be your friend then
[2:59:04] <Valentinius_Anodyne> If power go down, base go dead
[2:59:04] <nauskills> You can't bite Pat Steam
[2:59:08] <munitalprats> Turrets get fueled by spite.
[2:59:10] <%scallycap> this cannot be ALLOWED to be fucked with
[2:59:12] <SirDogBear> but capitalism though!
[2:59:13] <amiavamp> @spicystarbursts the map is infinite
[2:59:15] <winner_92> monkaS
[2:59:17] <%Jaxnos> you're doing great
[2:59:18] <HeWhoMonologues> They are perhaps peeved
[2:59:19] <@SSaryn> It happened a lot sooner than I thought.
[2:59:26] <%MidnightBurst12> hyper aggressive, even
[2:59:29] <munitalprats> Very aggressive doesnt matter if they're dead
[2:59:34] <LoneFonte> @spicystarbursts nah, pat just hasn't explored much
[2:59:35] <AmuserName> If you want to check them out, then ZOOM THE CAMERA OUT LUL
[2:59:37] <spicystarbursts> Interesting ,you can just Kite your enemies to the turrets
[2:59:38] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> That's pretty aggressive.
[2:59:41] <ThirdPersonPhil> you can zoom the camera way out to check them out
[2:59:43] <%walternatorz> "and I took that personally"
[2:59:43] <+tergvelo> Can't see bottom left corner - is there ammo in gun slot?
[2:59:43] <kazadaz> That's a zergling, Lester.  Smaller kind o Zerg
[2:59:45] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Good thing you had multiple turrets B)
[2:59:46] <BoneofMalkav> It's like watching someone playing Abuse on the hardest difficulty LUL
[2:59:50] <%Broand> You could probably gun down that base
[2:59:51] <EuropanLamprey> "How are you gonna stop some big mean motherhubber from tearing me a structury superfluously new behind.  The answer, is a Gun.  And if that don't work, use More Gun"
[2:59:59] <%Dunmarkh> @PatStaresAt zoom out the camera so you can see them
[3:00:01] <nauskills> Can you put the mic closer to Gief?
[3:00:13] <+tergvelo> You can press SPACE to hit enemies near your cursor with da bullets
[3:00:13] <SirDogBear> this factor builder person gonna need a bigger coffee cup BibleThump
[3:00:15] <LoneFonte> and underground belt
[3:00:18] <%Jaxnos> you can either separate or join
[3:00:18] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> magic
[3:00:20] <A0N33> Splitters are the best.
[3:00:20] <%Treuan> Splitter? I ardly know er
[3:00:20] <%darklordfodder> pollution makes them stronger
[3:00:21] <@SSaryn> You split it ez
[3:00:23] <munitalprats> big complex
[3:00:23] <bywayIdler> The only GOOD bug is a DEAD bug.
[3:00:24] <Flakari> 1:2, 2:1
[3:00:24] <%blastyoboots> @PatStaresAt you are getting GOOD at this. i can tell from the inventory management, you're getting REALLY in the swing~
[3:00:27] <amiavamp> I don't even remember if they got rid of "magic splitting memory"
[3:00:27] <%AncelDeLambert> @PatStaresAt they evenly split one belt into two, or two into one
[3:00:28] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Splitters combine or separate belts
[3:00:29] <winner_92> multi belt drifting ! ! !
[3:00:29] <%Landralin1996> Splitters are the best
[3:00:31] <spicystarbursts> Oh it takes a PACKED belt and splits it into smaller less packed belts
[3:00:33] <+b_aleph> now use the undergound ones and get rid of that long monstrosity aboveground
[3:00:35] <%Broand> 2 belt become 1 belt
[3:00:40] <+JobbedBone> it doesn't BibleThump we're waiting for a patch
[3:00:46] <%AncelDeLambert> splitters are great
[3:00:47] <Shacklebox> It will split one belt into 2 belts evenly
[3:00:48] <nauskills> Item on the upper part of the belt will stay on the upper part of both of the belts
[3:00:49] <+foomaster22> Just test it out yourself
[3:00:52] <amiavamp> Yes
[3:00:52] <munitalprats> Yeah
[3:00:53] <sailercartridge> belt balancers when
[3:00:53] <+thegreenbenis> Splitters are amazing.
[3:00:53] <kazadaz> YEAH
[3:00:53] <%walternatorz> arrow direction looks important
[3:00:54] <%Dunmarkh> YES
[3:00:55] <Flakari> Oh yes
[3:00:56] <%BestTeaMaker> yep
[3:00:56] <%AncelDeLambert> YEP
[3:00:56] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Satisfactory is the league of legends to Factorio's DOTA
[3:00:57] <%Daxalog> yup
[3:00:58] <+LittleBigQuebec> early yes
[3:00:58] <%darklordfodder> yes
[3:00:58] <%Arweynn> YES
[3:00:58] <skrewarrior> YES
[3:00:58] <LoneFonte> a lot, yeah
[3:00:59] <teavian> ye
[3:00:59] <%Treuan> P much
[3:00:59] <%blastyoboots> splitters and underground belts both important.  YES GREEN CHIPS NEEDED FOR EVERYTHING
[3:01:00] <+fancypan> oooooh yeah
[3:01:00] <%Dunmarkh> BIG BIG YES
[3:01:00] <%ChestMimik> OH YEAH
[3:01:00] <%Landralin1996> Join the Cult of the Green Chips
[3:01:01] <notabrobro> electric chips are a meme
[3:01:01] <+tergvelo> "splitters seem important" My work is done here
[3:01:01] <BwdYeti> They're one of the products you will make the most of
[3:01:04] <Psyramics> yes
[3:01:04] <%AncelDeLambert> they're a main bus product
[3:01:06] <reasonance> by the boatload
[3:01:07] <LVL1_Scumbag> You need SO many circuits
[3:01:07] <sendart> need to automate chips and gears
[3:01:08] <+D00msDayDan> @PatStaresAt destroying biter nests cranks evolution by a ton so when you take them out you better goddamn commit
[3:01:11] <%Broand> You're gonna wanna automate almost every resource
[3:01:12] <rafaelba93> make as much as you cab
[3:01:12] <sirtommygunn> yes
[3:01:13] <munitalprats> you need Copper wire, Gears, and Green chips for EVERYTHING. they are good automation targets
[3:01:13] <amiavamp> Electronic circuits will be one of your most-produced items, there's achievement for making a shitton of them
[3:01:17] <%Arweynn> green chips are second only to iron plate
[3:01:19] <%darklordfodder> you will need hundreds of thousands
[3:01:19] <Shacklebox> Yep, you'll automate it soon enough
[3:01:20] <%BestTeaMaker> cogs and electronics, just make a bunch of it
[3:01:30] <Expendamech> @PatStaresAt The splitter takes half of the intake belt(s) and puts it in any empty spaces on the SAME SIDE of the output belt(s)
[3:01:33] <SirDogBear> Factorio started off a as a Warcraft 1 Mod PogChamp
[3:01:48] <rafaelba93> experimente
[3:01:50] <Valentinius_Anodyne> You could use a splitter to move some coal from the mainline to the side one
[3:01:52] <Hegataro> @PatStaresAt the splitters can also filter stuff
[3:01:58] <EvanDude47> intersect that line with the iron belt
[3:02:07] <amiavamp> @SirDogBear that becomes a multi-layered joke if you say Warcraft 2 instead
[3:02:08] <kazadaz> bewdyful
[3:02:08] <%Jaxnos> so big, so strong
[3:02:08] <munitalprats> BRAIN WORK
[3:02:09] <AmuserName> YEYEYEYE
[3:02:10] <nauskills> Good job Pat
[3:02:10] <%Treuan> It works!
[3:02:11] <+foomaster22> HE'S DONE IT!
[3:02:12] <%BestTeaMaker> you. did it
[3:02:12] <cochramd1992> real big brain hours
[3:02:13] <%blastyoboots> VICTORY FOR PAT
[3:02:13] <%Dunmarkh> psaUp
[3:02:13] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Yep! There ya go
[3:02:14] <%Landralin1996> BEAUTIFUL!
[3:02:15] <LoneFonte> YOU DID IT
[3:02:15] <SirDogBear> dat connection PogChamp
[3:02:16] <+JobbedBone> BibleThump hes gone mad with power
[3:02:19] <+b_aleph> S M R T
[3:02:22] <%JoshManVGH> Factorial magic!
[3:02:25] <ThirdPersonPhil> This game is pretty good
[3:02:25] <%blistexthief> Sick
[3:02:25] <%AncelDeLambert> he DID it
[3:02:26] <%scallycap> BIG COOM
[3:02:30] <SaltyAzteca> The progress feel Kreygasm
[3:02:30] <+Celarious> BRAINGASM
[3:02:31] <sirtommygunn> Flawless victory
[3:02:32] <rafaelba93> they can also filter itens
[3:02:32] <+tergvelo> LEARNING IS HAPPENING
[3:02:33] <amiavamp> Is smart splitting enabled by default?
[3:02:34] <winner_92> when the automation hits just right Kreygasm
[3:02:35] <+LittleBigQuebec> @PatStaresAt you can even set line priority on the pliter
[3:02:36] <+sulf> you can also use splitters to make use of both sides of your belt
[3:02:36] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Good old splitters
[3:02:40] <LoneFonte> brain feel good?
[3:02:45] <Expendamech> Left click the splitter to configure intakes and filters if you want @PatStaresAt
[3:02:46] <kazadaz> Pat I think the rightmost Iron Furnace arm is backwards
[3:02:47] <bonebagMEL> he's starting to believe
[3:02:47] <%Monkeyweed21> wrong way
[3:02:54] <SirDogBear> lol good point @amiavamp
[3:03:07] <%AncelDeLambert> oh, no-one uses filters this early
[3:03:09] <LoneFonte> don't need that right now
[3:03:13] <+fancypan> Filter is super nice
[3:03:14] <%Jaxnos> wait til he sees what happens when he makes the belt gates that go underground
[3:03:18] <+sulf> doesnt matter right now
[3:03:18] <yamikami13> what's that snoring sound?
[3:03:18] <munitalprats> DONT WORRY ABOUT IT RN
[3:03:22] <+tergvelo> @Expendamech He was learning fine! Why add complexity!
[3:03:28] <rafaelba93> experiment
[3:03:32] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat, stop worrying about pollution, it will NEVER get better
[3:03:33] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Don't need it now, might want to figure it out later
[3:03:34] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Is the right iron furnace arm working?
[3:03:37] <SirDogBear> Pollution is always fine as long profit is made!
[3:03:38] <%blastyoboots> I forgot they added that that's fucking LIT
[3:03:40] <%AncelDeLambert> simply build GUN
[3:03:41] <munitalprats> yo pat what are you researching
[3:03:45] <yamikami13> am i the only one hearing this Snoring sound?
[3:03:47] <%Livelinne> I'm fiiiiine psaUp
[3:03:48] <kazadaz> Patrick, your rightmost iron furnace isn't doing anything
[3:03:48] <+JobbedBone> :) we drillin
[3:03:48] <%JoshManVGH> you have a bacwards inserter
[3:03:52] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat, you need walls
[3:04:01] <+D00msDayDan> those plates are gonna vanish immediately
[3:04:02] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Pollution only gets worse. That's why ya need more guns B)
[3:04:05] <%Dunmarkh> @yamikami13 NOPE psaGiefrail psaGiefrail
[3:04:06] <Expendamech> Just so he knows it's there. It's an energy-free filter for items @tergvelo
[3:04:06] <%Livelinne> Gief is super snoring
[3:04:06] <amiavamp> inserters are the most ocd shit
[3:04:07] <$SwagglesMD> SwagglesMD subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months! Ayy
[3:04:08] <+JobbedBone> @yamikami13 huh?
[3:04:08] <%primarch_lupercal> that snoring is zangief
[3:04:10] <nauskills> Elmo
[3:04:12] <RiverBirch> BABY
[3:04:15] <%blastyoboots> @yamikami13 that's ZANGEIF snoring directly into the microphone don't worry about it
[3:04:18] <%blistexthief> CAT
[3:04:20] <%AncelDeLambert> assemblers are bae
[3:04:23] <%Livelinne> psaPorgmo psaPorgmo psaPorgmo
[3:04:27] <SirDogBear> its like Captain Planet, the American solution to pollution is FIRE!
[3:04:28] <yamikami13> OHhh doggo snoring
[3:04:31] <LoneFonte> time for EXPERIMENTS
[3:04:31] <%za7az> psaPorgmo
[3:04:32] <%Jaxnos> IT IS TIME
[3:04:32] <munitalprats> they can make EVERYTHING
[3:04:32] <amiavamp> Buildings are items
[3:04:34] <nauskills> Yes
[3:04:35] <%BestTeaMaker> assemblers are you
[3:04:37] <ThirdPersonPhil> the awnser is everything
[3:04:39] <kazadaz> ANYTHING WITH 3 OR LESS INGREDIENTS
[3:04:40] <+foomaster22> You can make pretty much anything
[3:04:40] <Manwad> in your ass
[3:04:41] <%Landralin1996> Into a box
[3:04:42] <%AncelDeLambert> ... YOU ALREADY SAW THAT
[3:04:42] <sirtommygunn> Bye Elmo
[3:04:42] <%Dunmarkh> GRAY GOO
[3:04:42] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Everything can be automated :)
[3:04:43] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> a box
[3:04:43] <%ChestMimik> Wherever you need it to
[3:04:44] <%Monkeyweed21> ANYTHING
[3:04:44] <+D00msDayDan> AU TO MA TION
[3:04:44] <Psyramics> into a bo
[3:04:45] <%Broand> it's turned into an item
[3:04:46] <Flakari> TO YOU
[3:04:46] <RiverBirch> In there
[3:04:47] <%blastyoboots> put assembler into a crate
[3:04:47] <Calek> into boxes
[3:04:49] <notabrobro> no hand crafting!!!
[3:04:50] <%Daxalog> Its just icones
[3:04:51] <%Dunmarkh> on a belt
[3:04:51] <Shacklebox> ANYTHING
[3:04:51] <GunEden> you will automate EVERYTHING
[3:04:51] <KShirahama> ro belts
[3:04:51] <%BestTeaMaker> it has internal storage
[3:04:54] <%Livelinne> Pat scared Elmo psaGib
[3:04:55] <%Jaxnos> *plays theme of Simba claiming his throne on Pride Rock*
[3:04:56] <%Broand> Every building is actually an object
[3:04:57] <%marsantas> When you get drones you use supply boxes and blueprints to auto make everything
[3:04:58] <%AncelDeLambert> @PatStaresAt Pat, you have some in your pocket RIGHT NOW
[3:04:59] <Orenjevel> into the box, of course
[3:04:59] <kazadaz> You need to set up a robo arm to collect the output
[3:05:01] <%Arweynn> inserter to box or belt
[3:05:02] <$Dakuu75> where did you come from, where did you go, where did you come from cotton eye joe
[3:05:02] <+foomaster22> LIKE POKEMON BALLS
[3:05:02] <EvanDude47> in a box so you can deploy it
[3:05:04] <reasonance> it crafts stuff just like you do
[3:05:06] <%BestTeaMaker> but yeah assember > inserter > box
[3:05:06] <sirtommygunn> In your inventory
[3:05:08] <%Daxalog> Buildings are just icons until you place them
[3:05:09] <%AncelDeLambert> WHERE DOES IT GOOOO!? In your pocket
[3:05:09] <+tergvelo> Build the things that you need to build more things - THE FACTORY MUST GROW
[3:05:10] <Expendamech> into boxes and then into the logistics network so robots can build it SO THE FACTORY CAN GROW LARGER
[3:05:10] <ThirdPersonPhil> Its just a item like you have them in your bar
[3:05:11] <%Landralin1996> My favorite factory was an assembler making boxes and putting them into a box
[3:05:12] <winner_92> that iron belt lookin mighty full
[3:05:13] <Shacklebox> you gotta pull it out with an insterter
[3:05:14] <%JoshManVGH> shit just got wild
[3:05:14] <cochramd1992> Zangief Snowing ASMR
[3:05:15] <skrewarrior> one assembler can hold 100 assemblers
[3:05:16] <NeroInfinite> Yeah
[3:05:19] <munitalprats> with splitters! and underground belts!
[3:05:20] <%blastyoboots> inserter OUT of box, then use UNDERGROUND BELTS
[3:05:20] <Flakari> You make assemblers to make better assemblers
[3:05:21] <%Monkeyweed21> underground belts
[3:05:22] <BwdYeti> The removed the ingredient limit on low tier assemblers
[3:05:22] <hardin360> @PatStaresAt a basic inserter can keep up with the output of 3 furnaces which is why your plates are backing up.
[3:05:22] <Oqzar> you got underground belts now
[3:05:23] <kazadaz> Underground belt
[3:05:24] <bywayIdler> If you can BUILD it, you can AUTOMATE building it.
[3:05:25] <BlueLunecy> Underground belts!
[3:05:32] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Underground belts, baby!
[3:05:37] <sirtommygunn> You're in DBZ universe, these are capsule machines
[3:05:38] <+fancypan> late game its really nice to have a random constructor making one of everything so *the boys* can build anything
[3:05:39] <munitalprats> HES GONNA MARK OUT FROM UNDERGROUND BELTS SO HARD
[3:05:41] <duckmeister7> 4 stam 4 strength leather belt?
[3:05:42] <Shacklebox> YES
[3:05:49] <%Jaxnos> time to criss-cross
[3:05:57] <amiavamp> More hotbars
[3:05:59] <+sulf> press X to swap between
[3:06:02] <%Dunmarkh> more hot bars
[3:06:05] <TheSlothCast> they can make assemblers fit assemblers but resources are still finite
[3:06:06] <munitalprats> x
[3:06:06] <nauskills> Press X
[3:06:11] <SirDogBear> Zangief's sounds represent the anger of the planet, as Pat's pollution grows unchecked BibleThump
[3:06:13] <+D00msDayDan> hit x to switch which hotbar is at the top so is used by your number keys
[3:06:19] <sirtommygunn> Sets of hotbars
[3:06:23] <BwdYeti> And Ctrl + # to switch to the other bars maybe?
[3:06:33] <munitalprats> dont want it there
[3:06:35] <amiavamp> you can press shift+hotkey to select ones on bottom hotbar I think
[3:06:50] <%NopeBadguy> ELMOO
[3:06:53] <munitalprats> its blocking the coal and iron line move it one down
[3:06:59] <kazadaz> might as well cut out the middlemen
[3:07:01] <@SSaryn> That seems.. very inefficient.
[3:07:08] <%Jaxnos> i'm so proud of him, he's growing up so quickly BibleThump
[3:07:08] <+tergvelo> This is such an amazing feeling - watching someone new! I FEED ON YOUR EUREKA MOMENTS
[3:07:15] <Oqzar> splitter and store half
[3:07:16] <%blastyoboots> @PatStaresAt inserter isn't fast enough for this, you need a FAST INSERTER, so to the lab! :D
[3:07:16] <amiavamp> Put a box + inserter off to the side
[3:07:17] <%NopeBadguy> pat how are you enjoying your hard industrial crack
[3:07:18] <%JoshManVGH> why not connect tge belt?
[3:07:19] <Shacklebox> just make one belt and have an insterter steal some off the side
[3:07:23] <winner_92> the inserters are a bottleneck
[3:07:23] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> you can just belt that yeah
[3:07:24] <munitalprats> exactly! why would you!
[3:07:29] <dmtjinni> i never hear about elmo anymore
[3:07:29] <%Treuan> Efficiency!
[3:07:29] <+sulf> @tergvelo yeah its hard to find this very specific thing, feels nice
[3:07:31] <+EySoyCoco> Clap
[3:07:33] <%JoshManVGH> bamn
[3:07:34] <kazadaz> noice
[3:07:35] <HeWhoMonologues> @tergvelo If only more people thought like that
[3:07:42] <%Jaxnos> Kreygasm
[3:07:43] <+gespenst25> when the belt jams up the excess will be storred for a while
[3:07:44] <SirDogBear> now thats a treadmill PogChamp
[3:07:45] <Them00n> @PatStaresAt Just got here. Are you winning son?
[3:07:50] <BwdYeti> Having a box at the end of the line to pick up your excess production can be good, but yeah remove it from the middle of the line for throughput
[3:07:52] <munitalprats> the underground belt is blocking the coal and iron belt if you wanted to expand in the future
[3:08:00] <Expendamech> You would do that, because a belt can move 12 items per second.
[3:08:15] <munitalprats> i would just move it down 1
[3:08:19] <nauskills> No
[3:08:21] <+tergvelo> This is why I don't want to spoil anything - the moment of discovery is SO WONDROUS
[3:08:22] <+sulf> too far away
[3:08:23] <kazadaz> no, there's a length limit
[3:08:23] <%Dunmarkh> no
[3:08:24] <amiavamp> no
[3:08:24] <+foomaster22> Too far away
[3:08:26] <LoneFonte> NO
[3:08:26] <+fancypan> No its too long
[3:08:26] <%blastyoboots> Underground belts only go so far
[3:08:27] <BlueLunecy> No
[3:08:28] <+LittleBigQuebec> too far by 1
[3:08:31] <%ChestMimik> Yellow underground can only go up to 4 tiles
[3:08:33] <%blastyoboots> you would need two underground belts
[3:08:34] <%JoshManVGH> too far
[3:08:35] <munitalprats> there's a length limit
[3:08:36] <BwdYeti> When you mouse over them it shows the connection
[3:08:43] <+gespenst25> too far
[3:08:44] <amiavamp> move up a few tiles
[3:08:49] <ChungusQuest> @tergvelo searching for that feeling led me to watching like 20 different streamers do blind playthroughs of Outer Wilds
[3:08:58] <BwdYeti> Perfect
[3:08:59] <Expendamech> Yellow belt underground 4 tiles, Red belt underground 6 tiles, Blue belt underground 8 tiles. @PatStaresAt
[3:09:01] <%Azurism_> is someone snoring
[3:09:05] <amiavamp> you get longer underground belts later
[3:09:07] <%Dunmarkh> just use another undergrounf belt for the iron/coal
[3:09:08] <rafaelba93> its fine
[3:09:10] <%Mrbaconator> there ya go
[3:09:10] <LoneFonte> yeah
[3:09:14] <kazadaz> Don't worry about long-term problems too much, a big part of the game is dealing with the dumb decisions you made five hours ago, it's like losing souls in Dark Souls
[3:09:14] <nauskills> Gief baby is snoring
[3:09:28] <+tergvelo> @ChungusQuest Exactly! Though I haven't finished Outer Wilds so NO SPOILERS <3
[3:09:30] <%scallycap> lmao
[3:09:31] <skrewarrior> pat makes a lot of random snores that he blames on the dog
[3:09:31] <munitalprats> YEAH HE JUST REALIZED
[3:09:35] <nauskills> HERE WE GO BOYS
[3:09:37] <+sulf> break the problem down, what are u trying to automate
[3:09:38] <+foomaster22> Oh yeah now were getting to it
[3:09:39] <winner_92> this is one of those games where you say "i want to do this one thing" and then you do 12 other things in order to do that one thing and suddenly its 5 am
[3:09:41] <%Mrbaconator> IT BEGINS
[3:09:41] <@SSaryn> We're in
[3:09:42] <Expendamech> LUL
[3:09:42] <LoneFonte> LUL assembling that, yeah
[3:09:43] <%AzureGale> Yes, I imagine Jesus does poop
[3:09:43] <kazadaz> You can make assemblers feed other assemblers
[3:09:43] <amiavamp> Use underground belt to make it go around
[3:09:44] <DianaTheAscian> oh it hit him
[3:09:45] <+D00msDayDan> the real factorio starts here
[3:09:45] <%Jaxnos> exciting times ahead
[3:09:47] <Captain_Joe1911> tansy5Tuntun
[3:09:50] <%ChestMimik> Only that much?
[3:09:55] <BlueLunecy> Getting close!
[3:09:57] <sirtommygunn> Brain boiling
[3:09:59] <SirDogBear> Pollution is Fiiiiiiiiiiineeee LUL
[3:10:11] <LoneFonte> first fall
[3:10:12] <Valentinius_Anodyne> No such thing as too many guns, Pat B)
[3:10:14] <munitalprats> Pollution? nothing more pollution cant fix!
[3:10:15] <HeWhoMonologues> Count down begin: T-Minus 15mins before swarm implosion.
[3:10:20] <%metalicblackcherry> whos gonna teach pat how to build a bus
[3:10:21] <%blistexthief> Time for Mechanicus mode to start
[3:10:23] <+sulf> t section
[3:10:24] <amiavamp> Use another underground
[3:10:26] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Splitter?
[3:10:28] <kazadaz> Let's get this out onto a belt, nice
[3:10:35] <winner_92> splitter time
[3:10:35] <huskarl_zap> pollution doesnt matter the bugs are coming no matter what
[3:10:35] <+foomaster22> Use a splitter
[3:10:36] <munitalprats> just make a T or use a splitter
[3:10:37] <%Mrbaconator> need a splitter
[3:10:38] <rafaelba93> spliter can merge stuff too
[3:10:40] <ThirdPersonPhil> T intersection
[3:10:47] <BwdYeti> Ram two input belts into each other and then output sideways
[3:10:48] <jopeeps123> wtf am i looking at
[3:10:56] <ISKMogul> Oh god. . .
[3:10:57] <%ChestMimik> You can just use R to rotate belts btw
[3:11:01] <+D00msDayDan> two primaries and a heavy?
[3:11:01] <rafaelba93> T is cleaner
[3:11:02] <%JoshManVGH> holy shit this is like the best parts of Skyfactory and Stoneblock
[3:11:03] <hardin360> You already made 6
[3:11:03] <+BKNPham> really going all in there Pat
[3:11:04] <+DankDreamTeam> here we go! Left and right side management is online
[3:11:07] <munitalprats> you want all 3 of those things
[3:11:14] <SirDogBear> These Bort License Plates this factory making gonna be sweet PogChamp
[3:11:16] <%Dunmarkh> @jopeeps123 progress
[3:11:18] <%scallycap> LUL
[3:11:19] <winner_92> number go up !
[3:11:23] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Always room to expand
[3:11:25] <DudeDern> Is he trying to make something in particular?
[3:11:26] <snivins> thats good thinking pat
[3:11:27] <%blastyoboots> why are you automating assemblers already?  just the small stuff first XD
[3:11:27] <munitalprats> They're all gonna get used eventually
[3:11:28] <@SSaryn> We need MORE.
[3:11:29] <%Mrbaconator> MOAR
[3:11:34] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Has Pat done any ghost planning yet?
[3:11:35] <Dirksolomon> more is better
[3:11:37] <+sulf> welcome to the nightmare yeah

[3:12:00] <SirDogBear> the only nightmare is not making profit Pat CorgiDerp
[3:12:02] <%blastyoboots> MILITARY, you NEED that machine gun
[3:12:04] <+fancypan> G R O W F A C T O R Y
[3:12:06] <+sulf> shotgun is great for tree clearing
[3:12:09] <%Mrbaconator> the spaghetti is already boiling
[3:12:11] <jopeeps123> I love you pat but this game looks boring af,  but power to ya lol to progress!
[3:12:16] <nauskills> No

[3:12:21] <munitalprats> I dont think so
[3:12:21] <LoneFonte> nope
[3:12:21] <Shacklebox> green science is always good
[3:12:22] <%Dunmarkh> fuck no
[3:12:22] <+meisnewbie> no that's your inventory size
[3:12:22] <CrimsonFox777> L A M P
[3:12:22] <skrewarrior> no
[3:12:23] <%TheDullaMAN> What you see
[3:12:24] <%Landralin1996> What you see
[3:12:25] <Calek> it's what you see
[3:12:26] <%DrBunni> no
[3:12:31] <BwdYeti> It's exactly what you see
[3:12:31] <%scallycap> dump it into your machines
[3:12:32] <%TheDullaMAN> Box
[3:12:32] <notabrobro> boxes
[3:12:32] <+sulf> make a chest and dump it
[3:12:33] <einSynd> Put it in boxes
[3:12:33] <%ChestMimik> Boxes
[3:12:33] <+Javaa01> Make a box
[3:12:34] <%Dunmarkh> BUILD CHESTS
[3:12:34] <Dirksolomon> power armor and research can expand it
[3:12:34] <%DrBunni> poor pat
[3:12:34] <%Daxalog> Put it in a chest
[3:12:34] <EvanDude47> boxes
[3:12:35] <h8t0r_m4rs> no, store in a box
[3:12:35] <sendart> toss it into a boz
[3:12:35] <%marsantas> This is why we encourage BOXES
[3:12:35] <+keris90> chests
[3:12:36] <Flakari> Random storage chests
[3:12:36] <+tergvelo> PUt it in a box
[3:12:37] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Put it into your factory, or a box and shoot the box
[3:12:37] <ThirdPersonPhil> Make a box
[3:12:37] <%blastyoboots> MAKE BOX
[3:12:38] <amiavamp> dump it into a box or something
[3:12:38] <%Landralin1996> Dump it into a box and shoot the box
[3:12:38] <%JoshManVGH> Boxes?
[3:12:39] <+fancypan> in a chest and shoot it
[3:12:39] <%DrBunni> make chests
[3:12:40] <+foomaster22> Make a chest and just dump it
[3:12:40] <sirtommygunn> Absolutely not
[3:12:40] <Psyramics> make a box
[3:12:41] <munitalprats> Iron chests, dump it into your machine.
[3:12:41] <%DrBunni> lots of chests
[3:12:42] <%Mrbaconator> boxe
[3:12:42] <Expendamech> Please put the ores into the furnaces
[3:12:42] <+meisnewbie> you can put them in chests or craft with them
[3:12:43] <snivins> box of shame
[3:12:44] <SirDogBear> you get rid of it with more gun turrets
[3:12:44] <rafaelba93> box
[3:12:46] <%ChestMimik> It's an upgrade
[3:12:46] <%Mrbaconator> NOPE
[3:12:46] <kazadaz> Waste not, want not
[3:12:47] <%scallycap> its not infinite, why destroy it?
[3:12:48] <GustauveVIII> @PATSTARESAT dump it in a box and make the box output the belts
[3:12:49] <nauskills> You can research more inventory slots later
[3:12:49] <Shacklebox> BOXES
[3:12:49] <%marsantas> Put in box, shoot box to destroy
[3:12:52] <LoneFonte> you shoot the box LUL
[3:12:52] <%TheDullaMAN> You'll eventually use all of it
[3:12:55] <+b_aleph> WHY WOULD YOU DESTROY IT???
[3:12:55] <notabrobro> definitely don't destroy it
[3:12:57] <%DrBunni> you dont want to destroy anything
[3:12:57] <CrimsonFox777> Why would you want to destroy your precious materials? DansGame
[3:12:58] <+sulf> i cannot WAIT for logistic networks
[3:12:58] <amiavamp> Resources are limited, don't want to waste em
[3:12:58] <ISKMogul> Ctrl click items in inventory to dump them all at once
[3:13:00] <+tergvelo> Trust me, you will want ALL the resources. No destroy.
[3:13:00] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Why would you destroy resources, just cram it into your machines
[3:13:00] <BwdYeti> Put the ore in your furnaces, put the rest in boxes. You can gun down a box full of ore if you need to
[3:13:00] <GunEden> dump it in a box then destroy box
[3:13:01] <seth45er> save all that stuff for later.
[3:13:01] <skrewarrior> put it in a box and destroy the box with your gun
[3:13:03] <Expendamech> Ores -> Furnaces @PatStaresAt
[3:13:06] <+meisnewbie> if you want to destroy it, you can make a box and then destroy the box, everything inside goes away
[3:13:06] <LVL1_Scumbag> Why destroy what you can use?
[3:13:09] <Shacklebox> METAL BAWKSES
[3:13:13] <+fancypan> to be fair later on you can just have your robo buttlers whisk it away
[3:13:16] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> They'll use it eventualy
[3:13:17] <SirDogBear> You destroy it later in the Insurance Scam mode
[3:13:23] <munitalprats> need space for inserters
[3:13:25] <Orenjevel> dump it in a faraway garbage site
[3:13:27] <kazadaz> leave room for robo arms
[3:13:39] <%blastyoboots> you're gonna need the long inserter and belts full of components soon, I can't wait~
[3:13:42] <%DrBunni> Pat you're gonna wanna upscale your hydro electric power plant
[3:13:53] <%Monkeyweed21> too close
[3:13:54] <munitalprats> you cant power that many i think
[3:14:05] <h8t0r_m4rs> space for arms, dude
[3:14:06] <+b_aleph> Make a circular belt
[3:14:17] <+tergvelo> He will learn
[3:14:17] <%blastyoboots> inserter space yeah
[3:14:18] <kazadaz> Countdown til he realises he needs to delete it all
[3:14:27] <LVL1_Scumbag> Good question
[3:14:29] <DoremianC> Put ores in a box, have an iserter feed it back into smelter line. It will take a while, but you won't need to worry about it.
[3:14:33] <bywayIdler> Ooh, watching this is giving me IDEAS...
[3:14:40] <+sulf> the backseating is getting out of control now
[3:14:41] <+tergvelo> watching him learn is THE BEST
[3:14:44] <+b_aleph> destroy machine, return to monke
[3:14:44] <Shacklebox> he got it!
[3:14:57] <%blastyoboots> @bywayIdler one of us, ONE OF US, ONE OF US!
[3:15:02] <+tergvelo> LEARNING HAS HAPPENED
[3:15:05] <%JoshManVGH> How much power does your grid produce?
[3:15:06] <Orenjevel> my favorite part of these games is that while youre thinking about how to set stuff up, you're stockpiling loads of resources you can spend once youre finished
[3:15:07] <+D00msDayDan> BIG
[3:15:10] <LoneFonte> I'm just here to watch the brain go brrr
[3:15:20] <DudeDern> Big brain plays
[3:15:40] <%Crookedspiral> psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin
[3:15:50] <SirDogBear> if you get bigger monsters through pollution they should have better materials for harvesting like most rpgs, so pollution is win-win :)
[3:16:02] <nauskills> Good job Pat
[3:16:05] <kazadaz> This is going to end in great frustration
[3:16:09] <+sulf> what are you trying to automate right now?
[3:16:11] <%blastyoboots> @PatStaresAt if it needs resources too quickly then you can use two or even THREE INSERTERS for one assembler for BIG FAST
[3:16:13] <%blistexthief> How much do you think Woolie would hate this game, chat?
[3:16:14] <rafaelba93> i love the music
[3:16:18] <+tergvelo> I was going to play some Rocket League tonight, but now all I want to do is watch synapses fire in Pat's brain
[3:16:43] <munitalprats> gears, coil, and chips
[3:16:52] <+sulf> shift right click shift left click
[3:16:57] <BwdYeti> Shift right click, shift left click
[3:17:00] <%blastyoboots> @PatStaresAt there's a shortcut to copy and paste settings!!!!
[3:17:00] <+b_aleph> Like Justicce and Sol Badguy?
[3:17:03] <SirDogBear> Automate the Guilty Gears PogChamp
[3:17:16] <bywayIdler> Oh shit, I never even THOUGHT of that!
[3:17:32] <+b_aleph> When's Strive's automation?
[3:17:41] <munitalprats> i wonder if he can power all of this lol
[3:17:44] <Expendamech> Someone stop him before he belts copper cable.
[3:17:48] <kazadaz> An animal that can do anything.  Make a machine.  And make a machine to make a machine.  And an evil that can last a thousand years all by itself, no need to tend it.
[3:17:48] <+sulf> now they need a home
[3:17:54] <BwdYeti> ( Do note that copper wires aren't used for much other than directly being used for green circuits, so you don't need to stockpile them )
[3:17:55] <nauskills> Now inserters OUT! :)
[3:17:57] <%scallycap> i have about 90% of the techs researched and ive only ever had one gear assembler
[3:18:01] <munitalprats> you ran out of space already, you need them to have a home.
[3:18:01] <%TheDullaMAN> They need an output
[3:18:02] <%blastyoboots> pff not until you spit em out! assemblers don't hold much~
[3:18:07] <cochramd1992> I don't see those arms moving
[3:18:07] <ThirdPersonPhil> inserter for output
[3:18:09] <Shacklebox> now pull them out with inserters
[3:18:11] <%Cozy90> psaHoldon
[3:18:17] <%Daxalog> Time to split?
[3:18:21] <munitalprats> Assembly machines have SMALL inventories.
[3:18:24] <%Wurmspawn> You need to make an output for the constructors or they just stop after one cycle.
[3:18:25] <rafaelba93> splitter
[3:18:25] <LoneFonte> puzzle time
[3:18:26] <%harry_macdougall> harry_macdougall subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 14 months, currently on a 6 month streak! 
[3:18:27] <+tergvelo> I have high hopes
[3:18:30] <LVL1_Scumbag> How can this be?
[3:18:44] <Dirksolomon> Filter
[3:18:47] <%BestTeaMaker> use filter
[3:18:48] <+meisnewbie> you can use the filter option to separate them
[3:18:48] <%scallycap> use filter
[3:18:49] <kazadaz> that's what it does
[3:18:49] <+CanonFang_> yes
[3:18:50] <%Landralin1996> That's what the filter is for
[3:18:50] <BwdYeti> You can put a filter on the splitter
[3:18:51] <+sulf> you can set it to only split copper on the right side with the filter
[3:18:51] <rafaelba93> filrer
[3:18:53] <+Edrem> you can right click it to filter
[3:18:54] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Yeahh, time to use splitters and underground belts
[3:18:55] <DudeDern> Is factorio technically a puzzle game?
[3:18:56] <nauskills> HOW CAN THIS BE
[3:19:02] <+tergvelo> Can he derive the optimal "standard" setup? Or will he make something FANTASTIC? My money is on the latter.
[3:19:07] <%blastyoboots> @PatStaresAt filter iron out to right!
[3:19:10] <+DJReViveAll> filter + output priority
[3:19:10] <%Daxalog> What do you want to filter out?
[3:19:11] <A0N33> The filter will make the specified item output on the specified side
[3:19:12] <BallisticMeerkat> what its transferring over
[3:19:12] <%TheDullaMAN> Pat, have some of you assemblers on the right make wire, then feed them into the assemblers to make circuits
[3:19:13] <kazadaz> Filter means filter
[3:19:13] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> What do you want the splitter to filter to one side?
[3:19:13] <+Jaromero435> it moves the whole belt over
[3:19:16] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> choose plate?
[3:19:16] <+fancypan> Your looking for filter
[3:19:17] <+D00msDayDan> pick the item you want to filter, then the output you want to filter it to
[3:19:17] <Expendamech> Output priorty - Right. Filter - Iron plates.
[3:19:21] <+b_aleph> it means
[3:19:21] <%keye90> select the item you want to filter to
[3:19:23] <h8t0r_m4rs> yes
[3:19:25] <ChungusQuest> Breathe, Pat
[3:19:29] <LVL1_Scumbag> Means choose what you want to split
[3:19:30] <+sulf> thats it
[3:19:34] <+DJReViveAll> filter = iron plates, output = right
[3:19:34] <kazadaz> You did it!
[3:19:37] <+tergvelo> @PatStaresAt Ignore chat - Make it how you want!
[3:19:45] <nauskills> Pat brain: NotLikeThis
[3:19:51] <rafaelba93> extend the belt to see whats happening
[3:19:57] <+D00msDayDan> @tergvelo i don't think he should ignore chat when his brain is literally melting live on stream
[3:19:57] <sleepy_pixels> success
[3:20:06] <munitalprats> check your power
[3:20:07] <snivins> yeah pat embrace the spaguetti
[3:20:13] <+HuoShengdi> One thing about copper cable: 1 plate turns into 2 cables so it's best to build the cables right next to the circuit assemblers and feed them directly rather than belting the cables
[3:20:14] <+sulf> would his brain melt less without chat
[3:20:25] <@SSaryn> Idk what the fuck is happening lol
[3:20:34] <+The_I_T_Guy> Pat you need to make the right ones gears and the left ones wire. Grabbers grab from the far side of the belt
[3:20:35] <%blastyoboots> @PatStaresAt a wire assembler makes wires faster than a circuit assembler consumes it, but I won't tell you the ratio because you've mentioned you love doing that yourself ;D
[3:20:36] <+b_aleph> game is too smart for pat
[3:20:37] <%keye90> Unlimited Powaaaaa
[3:20:44] <Expendamech> @PatStaresAt run a couple of belt tiles off the splitter to see what the output filter did
[3:20:47] <kazadaz> This game flew a rocket ship so Satisfactory could run
[3:20:59] <+The_I_T_Guy> wait nvm I'm dumb
[3:21:01] <einSynd> Nothing's actually using power right now
[3:21:03] <skrewarrior> @The_I_T_Guy grabbers grab from either
[3:21:04] <%TIME_PUNCHER> @patstaresat this game is basically a camping sex simulator. it's fucking in tents psaDab
[3:21:07] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Pat will probably make a new world after the stream.
[3:21:09] <nauskills> @The_I_T_Guy Inserters can grab from either side of the belt
[3:21:09] <snivins> he is actually doing pretty decent for first freeplay
[3:21:17] <+sulf> @kazadaz satisfactory will be this game with another 10 years of updates xd
[3:21:23] <+tergvelo> @D00msDayDan But brain melting gets us amazing spaghetti...
[3:21:34] <munitalprats> pat what are those even going to do
[3:21:44] <+D00msDayDan> @tergvelo pat paralyzed by not knowing what he's looking at leads to NO spaghetti
[3:22:20] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Why not directly belt from one assembler to another? is that not possible?
[3:22:21] <kazadaz> there's vomit on his sweater already
[3:22:33] <rafaelba93> embrace the pasta
[3:22:34] <munitalprats> @ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter its absolutely possible
[3:22:38] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Or would that take much more belt
[3:22:39] <+b_aleph> make a second floor
[3:22:43] <+tergvelo> @tergvelo Fair. I think we're both hoping for some primo pasta, yes?
[3:22:44] <BwdYeti> You can move items directly from one assembler to another, yes
[3:23:15] <nauskills> @b_aleph 3D? In my Factorio?
[3:23:20] <munitalprats> but **where are they going to go**
[3:23:23] <kazadaz> Hey Pat, assemblers are like science buildings, you can use robo arms to move things straight from one to the other
[3:23:37] <+D00msDayDan> @tergvelo yes, we need to guide pat's hips to the plate so he can prepare his own special spaghetti
[3:23:40] <+sulf> long inserters
[3:23:41] <munitalprats> THINK
[3:23:42] <TigerClaws12> LUL
[3:23:45] <+b_aleph> wtf?
[3:23:48] <%Daxalog> Measure twice
[3:23:55] <%Nekros4442> Robo arms again?
[3:23:55] <%scallycap> its a puzzle
[3:23:59] <+D00msDayDan> long inserters
[3:24:00] <Oqzar> expand it up
[3:24:02] <ThirdPersonPhil> underground
[3:24:03] <NeroInfinite> Do you want it like that pat? LUL
[3:24:03] <TigerClaws12> work that brain
[3:24:04] <munitalprats> baba
[3:24:06] <%blastyoboots> @PatStaresAt LONG INSERTERS into a further away belt, that's how!!!!
[3:24:09] <LVL1_Scumbag> It's impossible
[3:24:16] <%scallycap> you can do it without long inserters
[3:24:17] <sirtommygunn> red arms
[3:24:18] <rafaelba93> you will figure it out
[3:24:18] <DudeDern> Brainblast!
[3:24:25] <munitalprats> its not impossible
[3:24:26] <skrewarrior> factorio is a puzzle game where you create your own puzzles
[3:24:31] <RyanGelatin> tried dyson sphere program (dsp lol) as my first one of these factory games and man that feels like one you shoouldnt start with cos i was barely on the cusp of understanding the basic mechanincs
[3:24:33] <SirDogBear> you get them out with more gun turrets!
[3:24:44] <nauskills> Uh oh
[3:24:45] <munitalprats> you do want chips.
[3:24:46] <Expendamech> @PatStaresAt Tell us what you're thinking through so we can help you better.
[3:24:48] <%blastyoboots> did you want chips or red science??
[3:24:51] <kazadaz> do chips even use gears?
[3:24:58] <%Jekado> @RyanGelatin DSP also is still very much in early access
[3:24:59] <DianaTheAscian> is he breaking?
[3:25:01] <DudeDern> How do we get Woolie to play this
[3:25:06] <sirtommygunn> oops
[3:25:14] <munitalprats> you put that splitter there for a reason.
[3:25:19] <RyanGelatin> and the translation doesnt he;lp it
[3:25:25] <+D00msDayDan> imagine a circuit board with gears in it
[3:25:25] <rafaelba93> spread the production a little?
[3:25:25] <amiavamp> Pat.exe has encountered an error abd needs to close
[3:25:25] <+sulf> look at green chips for a second in your menu
[3:25:25] <+dantejoestar21> dantejoestar21 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 19 months! 
[3:25:31] <Dirksolomon> Plate with cable no?
[3:25:33] <%walternatorz> Is Paige around to reset Pat?
[3:25:34] <+b_aleph> @DudeDern this is kind of a Minh game, so start from there
[3:25:35] <%blastyoboots> @PatStaresAt you wanted gears for RED Science, you keep mixing that up with Chips which you also want but not immediately
[3:25:35] <nauskills> Pat is dying
[3:25:36] <SirDogBear> Tell Woolie this game has Gears and he will be all over it!
[3:25:39] <RyanGelatin> good music and atmosphere tho id love to try it again
[3:25:40] <munitalprats> combine the rightmost belt for copper cable with the iron plate belt
[3:25:45] <hardin360> Use your words
[3:25:50] <DianaTheAscian> Is Pat okay?
[3:25:54] <%AncelDeLambert> Baaaaaabaaaaaaaa
[3:26:00] <munitalprats> combine the copper cable belt and the iron plate belt
[3:26:01] <@SSaryn> Number? Numberrrr.
[3:26:04] <+b_aleph> numbahs
[3:26:05] <kazadaz> Every Chip assembler needs 3 copper wires every 0.5 seconds
[3:26:05] <RyanGelatin> but baba is me
[3:26:09] <+Epic_Fubar> hmmmm yes
[3:26:09] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat's having a logistics meltdown
[3:26:10] <+fancypan> Oh god it broke pat
[3:26:11] <ape_hawk> is pat addicted yet?
[3:26:15] <%scallycap> mmmmmmaaaaaa
[3:26:17] <%ArticPath> How can this be
[3:26:18] <+sulf> that works
[3:26:19] <T_Sasquatch> but baba ?!
[3:26:19] <%blastyoboots> that works!
[3:26:20] <+DigbyMayor> Oh hell yeah I love Factorio
[3:26:20] <munitalprats> that will work
[3:26:20] <nauskills> Throw your arms in the air just to make sure you're not having a stroke
[3:26:27] <+RyanTheRecluse> ?
[3:26:29] <%scallycap> i love this so much
[3:26:30] <hardin360> That will work
[3:26:30] <%Mrbaconator> but BAABAAAA
[3:26:31] <LoneFonte> this...?
[3:26:32] <@SSaryn> wait what
[3:26:34] <%AncelDeLambert> @PatStaresAt here's some help: one wire output can fuel about 3 chip production assemblers
[3:26:35] <skrewarrior> is pat addicted or dying?
[3:26:35] <RyanGelatin> pat sounding like hes constipated and about to shit his pants when he breathes while thinking too hard
[3:26:36] <Expendamech> Halfway there patrick.
[3:26:36] <sirtommygunn> Pat is using 150% of his brain power
[3:26:42] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Pat's brain is suffering a DOT
[3:26:43] <+b_aleph> Can we seee a live aneurysm for the first time in twitch?
[3:26:45] <%scallycap> thats a lot of fuckin chips
[3:26:45] <$Dakuu75> doodBigBrain
[3:26:48] <%blastyoboots> sure, power it up and watch it go big fast
[3:26:50] <kazadaz> baba need chip
[3:26:56] <+D00msDayDan> @PatStaresAt remember you unlocked long-armed inserters when you researched assemblers
[3:26:56] <%ArticPath> It works
[3:26:57] <DudeDern> Doctor we’re loosing him
[3:26:57] <BwdYeti> This is a solution that will function
[3:26:58] <Expendamech> 75% the way there patrick
[3:26:59] <+Epic_Fubar> no word, ONLY BELT
[3:27:00] <%walternatorz> Pat, I'm worried.
[3:27:02] <LoneFonte> i'm loving this shit LUL
[3:27:02] <nauskills> monkaS
[3:27:04] <munitalprats> why kill?
[3:27:04] <%scallycap> this is gonna be an absolute fucking ton of chips
[3:27:06] <sirtommygunn> what the fuck
[3:27:06] <SirDogBear> making Funko Pops take a lot of work
[3:27:10] <+DigbyMayor> Oh he's doing red science
[3:27:20] <amiavamp> never enough green chips
[3:27:22] <+b_aleph> LUL LUL LUL
[3:27:24] <munitalprats> no, this is green chips @DigbyMayor
[3:27:26] <Dirksolomon> Yees
[3:27:27] <LoneFonte> THIS. CANNOT. CONTINUE.
[3:27:35] <nauskills> Yes chip
[3:27:36] <%blastyoboots> @DigbyMayor he is using red science AND green chips and keeps forgetting which one he's doing
[3:27:41] <DudeDern> Are gears kill?
[3:27:42] <%Mrbaconator> BECOME AS GODS
[3:27:43] <sendart> not sure this is the best way but it should work
[3:27:46] <RyanGelatin> i like that these games feel like puzzle games i feel like im using my brain a lot playing these
[3:27:48] <Expendamech> 80%
[3:27:57] <+DigbyMayor> @blastyoboots That's even funnier
[3:28:00] <+Spur3G> it's really fun to watch a mans brain crease in real time
[3:28:02] <munitalprats> his power is gonna get consumed like immediately
[3:28:03] <winner_92> you know it's getting good when pat is speaking in exclusively one word sentences
[3:28:05] <nauskills> Upgrade Pat processor
[3:28:08] <kazadaz> hell yeah
[3:28:10] <amiavamp> gief sounds like a fucking silent hill monster
[3:28:13] <Expendamech> 92% the way there
[3:28:14] <%Nekros4442> Man that is some aggressive snoring
[3:28:23] <+sulf> congrats on your first production line, only a million to go
[3:28:25] <%Jekado> wait are you getting wire?
[3:28:27] <rafaelba93> pat you are doing great
[3:28:27] <invalid_robin> Ok thats actually a clever design
[3:28:30] <munitalprats> alright pat you're almost there, but WHAT is the left assembly machines going to assemble?
[3:28:32] <kazadaz> Now put chip in box
[3:28:38] <Expendamech> @PatStaresAt good job you automated green circuits.
[3:28:38] <+b_aleph> Press T to start a new research
[3:28:43] <sirtommygunn> congratulations!
[3:28:46] <nauskills> Is Gief okay? LUL
[3:28:48] <invalid_robin> U can make that tileable too
[3:28:49] <%scallycap> this is gonna be so many fuckin chips lol
[3:28:50] <SirDogBear> this music sounds like you need more gun turrets
[3:28:51] <RyanGelatin> is that noise dog snoring? i thought it was in game ambient metal creaking sounds
[3:28:52] <%blastyoboots> Zangief is like, finding ways to snore louder and in more agony just to get heard easier and easier as the stream goes on
[3:28:55] <LoneFonte> need output
[3:28:58] <DesertZero> Need output
[3:28:58] <munitalprats> and where are the chips going?
[3:29:19] <sirtommygunn> Double arm grabbing... !!!
[3:29:20] <RyanGelatin> does the dog need a cpap machine??
[3:29:20] <kazadaz> golly
[3:29:23] <%Dunmarkh> @munitalprats we'll burn that bridge when we cross it
[3:29:24] <LoneFonte> there is no production. die.
[3:29:25] <+Epic_Fubar> SMOrc kill metal thing
[3:29:27] <nauskills> Just need 2 inserters per assemblers
[3:29:28] <+sulf> poggers
[3:29:30] <winner_92> many arm
[3:29:35] <%walternatorz> Nightmare slain.
[3:29:35] <+D00msDayDan> i love this
[3:29:44] <+fancypan> an..interesting solution
[3:29:46] <%Dunmarkh> LUL
[3:29:46] <TofuNyan> I..
[3:29:46] <+Spur3G> this is really overkill
[3:29:50] <JigsK> it does get hard to see whats going on in this game sometimes. something to do with the same-y colors and numerous flashing symbols
[3:29:52] <amiavamp> octopath assembler
[3:29:52] <munitalprats> is the nightmare slain? or is it a new biggerer nightmare?
[3:29:57] <TheFramedWarlock> What the absolute fuck. Why are you putting so many arms down
[3:29:57] <einSynd> The game puts squares around things, like the inserters being powered by a pole
[3:29:58] <+DigbyMayor> Insight gained
[3:29:59] <sirtommygunn> I like how Pat's brain has to reset like once a minute
[3:30:05] <rafaelba93> spaghetti it up, dont fear the pasta for now
[3:30:14] <+DrSmashy> no
[3:30:14] <nauskills> No
[3:30:14] <+sulf> no
[3:30:16] <kazadaz> Nope
[3:30:17] <munitalprats> no you need arm
[3:30:17] <%TheDullaMAN> Nope
[3:30:17] <amiavamp> no
[3:30:18] <Expendamech> incoming biters to interrupt and break focus. Kappa
[3:30:18] <Dirksolomon> Need inserter
[3:30:18] <+DigbyMayor> No the arm has to feed a box
[3:30:18] <LoneFonte> no
[3:30:19] <BwdYeti> No, need an arm
[3:30:19] <Calek> game isn't that cool
[3:30:20] <%blastyoboots> no that would be easy
[3:30:21] <einSynd> There's a mod for that, but no
[3:30:21] <BallisticMeerkat> mo inserter first
[3:30:21] <JigsK> it cannot
[3:30:21] <TheFramedWarlock> No
[3:30:25] <%Daxalog> Arm into box
[3:30:25] <LVL1_Scumbag> Need arm
[3:30:28] <DianaTheAscian> I feel like this is only making the goblins evolve
[3:30:28] <Shacklebox> no
[3:30:31] <%scallycap> if you wrap the belt around the box you can feed it with multiple inserters
[3:30:38] <%Dunmarkh> use the inserter to insert items into a box
[3:30:48] <hardin360> Generally you just route components on belts past the machines that use them.
[3:30:49] <munitalprats> alright pat, how are they gonna get to the belt
[3:30:53] <einSynd> No outserters
[3:30:56] <RyanGelatin> are you gonna try dyson sphere program sometime pat?
[3:31:06] <+D00msDayDan> no inserters to outsert
[3:31:07] <%marsantas> You can see how this is so addictive as it progresses huh
[3:31:09] <kazadaz> wooooooo
[3:31:11] <nauskills> Chip
[3:31:13] <TheFramedWarlock> That's actually some nice tech scallycap  I didn't think of that
[3:31:15] <winner_92> many chip !
[3:31:15] <+DrSmashy> greeen
[3:31:17] <+b_aleph> progress!
[3:31:19] <munitalprats> ITS LIKE THE DETROID BECOME HUMAN INTRO
[3:31:26] <%YakumoYomi> psaDab
[3:31:28] <%scallycap> @TheFramedWarlock i do it for everything
[3:31:29] <defaultname3887> holy shit i was catchip up in the vod and came to check, nice adeptus wet dream you're working on
[3:31:29] <cochramd1992> okay, now what?
[3:31:30] <%Jekado> @RyanGelatin I think he said he tried it and didn't like it?
[3:31:31] <SirDogBear> Green Greens! PogChamp
[3:31:34] <+fancypan> Now turn those babies into science
[3:31:37] <kazadaz> Hero pat
[3:31:40] <LoneFonte> gloryJeb gloryJeb gloryJeb gloryJeb
[3:31:41] <LVL1_Scumbag> Chips!
[3:31:43] <munitalprats> alright pat, now what about the left side?
[3:31:44] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> It gets easier
[3:31:45] <Calek> very satisfying though
[3:31:45] <Expendamech> @PatStaresAt there's an achievement for 20 million green circuits produced, FYI.
[3:31:48] <%blastyoboots> @PatStaresAt twist the belt around the crate and use three inserters to put it in crate big fast
[3:31:49] <DianaTheAscian> its stopping?
[3:31:49] <+D00msDayDan> @munitalprats now i want to see old white guy reacting to marcus's painting but it's pat factory
[3:31:50] <SilverRoddo> RPGEmpty insertHype
[3:31:51] <Shacklebox> Dyson Sphere Program looks ugly
[3:31:51] <%JoshManVGH> VIDEO GAMES
[3:31:54] <+DigbyMayor> I fear Green Science is going to kill him
[3:31:57] <%walternatorz> Can pat dedicate more processing power to speech again?
[3:31:58] <NaderShahDidNothingWrong> Two, something's got to give
[3:31:58] <%Dunmarkh> YOU'RE A PRO GAMER PAT, KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK
[3:32:00] <TheFramedWarlock> Is Pat playing with no enemies on ?
[3:32:01] <BallisticMeerkat> it's not, it's just over whelming
[3:32:02] <%marsantas> You're learning, this will be standard once you're used to it
[3:32:07] <winner_92> there must be like a faster inserter you get or something
[3:32:08] <NeroInfinite> You need faster picker upper
[3:32:09] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> It will never be this tough ever again.
[3:32:18] <DudeDern> “Was it Red green green, or Red green red?”
[3:32:26] <%blastyoboots> OMG undergroud belt from other side of splitter and you're golden!
[3:32:35] <munitalprats> theres a faster everything @winner_92
[3:32:37] <+DigbyMayor> Yeah, this is going to be easy breezy in only a couple hours.
[3:32:38] <kazadaz> You can use an underground belt to get the copper plates away from that splitter
[3:32:46] <SirDogBear> The only answer is Steam Punk Science!
[3:32:47] <BwdYeti> You should switch the filter on the splitter so they go the opposite way
[3:32:53] <NeroInfinite> There are tier 3 inserters that go super fast
[3:32:54] <ThirdPersonPhil> You can built on top of existing threadmills to change its direction
[3:32:56] <%Daxalog> Pog
[3:32:58] <BallisticMeerkat> lay belt on top of belts to quick change positions
[3:33:02] <%Mrbaconator> @PatStaresAt you can just place belts over already placed belts in another direction no need to manually turn each one around
[3:33:05] <Shacklebox> you can build over old belts and it'll switch them around instantly
[3:33:09] <munitalprats> hey pat, whatcha researching?
[3:33:11] <winner_92> @munitalprats arm speed go up?
[3:33:14] <+b_aleph> this stream sounds like the english coming from the mouth of a stereotypical eastern man
[3:33:18] <nauskills> Noo
[3:33:29] <munitalprats> @winner_92 everything go up
[3:33:30] <Expendamech> T junction
[3:33:32] <TheFramedWarlock> Oh my god NotLikeThis
[3:33:33] <sailercartridge> make that T
[3:33:36] <+fancypan> you"ll want to switch the plate side
[3:33:38] <+DigbyMayor> The copper is on the wrong side
[3:33:40] <nauskills> Now gears can't put gears on belt
[3:33:41] <+sulf> you need to put copper on the other side so ur gears can fit on the left
[3:33:43] <SirDogBear> dat split PogChamp
[3:33:47] <%blastyoboots> oh shit wrong side copper.  make copper go to T intersection to go to east side of belt instead of west side, b/c inserters from gear machines will output west side
[3:33:49] <kazadaz> Those assemblers are full of gears, but they can't get out because the arms are asleep
[3:33:49] <munitalprats> but why copper plate? what are you using copper plates for?
[3:34:03] <+b_aleph> LUL LUL LUL
[3:34:04] <%TheDullaMAN> Other way.
[3:34:08] <LoneFonte> other way
[3:34:11] <munitalprats> you can just split it
[3:34:15] <winner_92> the splitter with the underground belt is very elegant i like that
[3:34:17] <+D00msDayDan> you're close
[3:34:18] <+TardyClock> Copper... copper plate... copper... copper...
[3:34:19] <TheFramedWarlock> Get your gear production started first. Then worry about making red science
[3:34:22] <%Dunmarkh> psaUp
[3:34:23] <%blastyoboots> you did it XD
[3:34:24] <%TheDullaMAN> It's fine.
[3:34:24] <+b_aleph> This game is fucking  great LUL
[3:34:33] <kazadaz> simple though
[3:34:43] <$SGrim> ZZZZ
[3:34:53] <Shacklebox> it's easier than changing the settings on belts
[3:34:55] <kazadaz> that's honestly a nice little assembly area you got there
[3:34:55] <%blastyoboots> ZANGIEF IS NOW BREATHING THROUGH HIS ASSHOLE
[3:35:01] <Expendamech> left-most assemblers to red science packs + power
[3:35:18] <Shacklebox> He's working on research relax
[3:35:26] <%walternatorz> was that a tree joke, @PatStaresAt ?
[3:35:28] <munitalprats> weird science!
[3:35:31] <Calek> yeah science!
[3:35:37] <+b_aleph> LUL LUL LUL
[3:35:41] <HeWhoMonologues> To hell with your science!
[3:35:44] <+TardyClock> Zangief sounds like a tiny racecar on a tiny track that gets close to the microphone and then speeds away.
[3:35:45] <winner_92> science go up
[3:35:45] <%keye90> @blastyoboots LUL LUL LUL LUL LUL LUL LUL LUL
[3:35:48] <SirDogBear> produce more SCIENCE!
[3:35:56] <LoneFonte> which means.......
[3:36:05] <munitalprats> he's gonna need more power
[3:36:14] <Expendamech> Output to belt. Belt to Labs. MORE RESEARCH. THE FACTORY GROWS
[3:36:21] <%blastyoboots> having a shitton of green circuits in your inventory at all times means MUCH MUCH FASTER handcrafting :D
[3:36:26] <%TheDullaMAN> It needs an OUTPUT
[3:36:28] <+foomaster22> LUL
[3:36:30] <kazadaz> I don't think that makes a difference
[3:36:33] <+DigbyMayor> THE FACTORY GROWS
[3:36:34] <winner_92> ok seriously it seems like you need to get Faster Arm they are a bottleneck
[3:36:35] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Lab time. If possible, feed the labs with a half conveyor of red, so you can put green on the other half.
[3:36:35] <cochramd1992> okay but take your output away though
[3:36:38] <SirDogBear> more science means more advance Funko Pops!
[3:36:45] <Expendamech> No one tell him it takes 5 seconds to make a red science pack.
[3:36:45] <%Monkeyweed21> now out put to labs
[3:36:46] <munitalprats> sciency and gear production has stopped because there's no room
[3:36:50] <%TheDullaMAN> Sorry for Caps-ing...
[3:36:59] <+foomaster22> Now put the science in a lab
[3:37:07] <+b_aleph> K, maybe the tutorial wasn't harder than freeplay LUL
[3:37:16] <kazadaz> more belts
[3:37:23] <LoneFonte> @Expendamech i mean, red science automation is an important step
[3:37:24] <cochramd1992> also I don't see any incoming gears
[3:37:24] <%TheDullaMAN> Just move the ones from the bottom over here.
[3:37:26] <%blastyoboots> you can highlight the assember to see how many it's making a second if it isn't clogged
[3:37:29] <+DigbyMayor> Yeah this game isn't as ratio centric as satisfactory
[3:37:32] <duuupes> extremely cool to make 1/s on accident
[3:37:33] <DesertZero> Direct insert Daddy
[3:37:34] <+sulf> feel like the biters should of striked by now
[3:37:34] <rafaelba93> when the production line is stuck it wont use energy, when evrything is rolling energy use will go uo
[3:37:43] <+Furfurlurd> As a 600+ hours factorio player, im getting super triggered.
[3:37:53] <%blastyoboots> it's clogged nvm
[3:37:58] <kazadaz> Assemblers work at half the speed YOU craft things
[3:37:59] <amiavamp> it's 0.5 compared to handcrafting
[3:38:00] <+b_aleph> @Furfurlurd LUL LUL LUL
[3:38:00] <BallisticMeerkat> 1 every 0.5 seconds
[3:38:08] <%blastyoboots> @DigbyMayor HAHAHA YOU WOULD THINK SO BUT YOU ARE SOMEWHAT WRONG
[3:38:14] <cochramd1992> okay but unload it though
[3:38:18] <%AncelDeLambert> yes, saturation is good
[3:38:19] <kazadaz> A full belt is a happy belt
[3:38:20] <munitalprats> its not consuming power while its clogged
[3:38:30] <JigsK> @Furfurlurd come on man, find a way to chill a bit and look at the game through the eyes of a new player again
[3:38:31] <Calek> clogged is good
[3:38:34] <xbb1024> Pat likes shit clogged
[3:38:41] <munitalprats> these labs are gonna give you brown outs
[3:38:44] <%ArticPath> You like storage and overflow clogged. Your machines should be working

[3:39:12] <+vaderxyz1970> You need to understand the Toyota method of "Just in Time" manufacturing
[3:39:16] <SirDogBear> back to gun turret as it should be
[3:39:17] <rafaelba93> you can use insertes to make a ine of labs
[3:39:39] <%Marktherussian1> Marktherussian1 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! 
[3:39:41] <DesertZero> Kaizen, btw
[3:39:49] <cochramd1992> what is he doing, I don't think there are that many levels of science
[3:40:08] <%Dunmarkh> just bulk build inserters, you'll use them
[3:40:09] <RyuuAoi> Pat, everytime u fuk up, I take a shot. Take it easy on me.
[3:40:12] <Shacklebox> research GUN
[3:40:13] <+D00msDayDan> lights are huge QOL
[3:40:15] <SirDogBear> Pat moved beyond producing science, hes jumping into magic tech!
[3:40:17] <%Landralin1996> EYYYYYYYY
[3:40:17] <BwdYeti> science go big up
[3:40:20] <%AzureGale> Yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaah

[3:41:49] <CrimsonFox777> You heard it here folks: "Pollution's good."
[3:41:50] <LVL1_Scumbag> Now we see if he can master the green science goblin
[3:41:50] <%blastyoboots> SAVE YOUR GAME
[3:41:50] <%TheWinged7> "pollution is good" - Patric Boivin
[3:41:52] <munitalprats> we'll ruin everything when we need green
[3:41:59] <%Dunmarkh> you're doing good
[3:41:59] <kazadaz> That's fine
[3:42:00] <sailercartridge> when things aren't clogged and are kept fed the whole factory looks like that
[3:42:01] <EvanDude47> given your current situations going well, remember how hard the tutorial was?
[3:42:03] <winner_92> how do you feel about factorio vs satisfactory so far @PatStaresAt
[3:42:04] <%blistexthief> This is making me want to relapse into playing again
[3:42:04] <+sulf> its autosaving hes fine
[3:42:04] <%blastyoboots> @PatStaresAt Big Save Game right damn now i recommends
[3:42:04] <Shacklebox> Your pollution is gonna be good for a while, you are prepared
[3:42:06] <+D00msDayDan> lamps are the shit, imagine being able to see shit at night
[3:42:11] <%Monkeyweed21> PAT THE COAL
[3:42:12] <moosemonkey397> dont need coper cable by itself for a LONG time
[3:42:14] <munitalprats> relax it autosaves every 5 minutes stop it @blastyoboots
[3:42:15] <%Dunmarkh> fuck lamps, it ain't that dark
[3:42:25] <LVL1_Scumbag> Copper cable is mostly only used for circuits anyway
[3:42:30] <+sulf> oo
[3:42:30] <Captain_Joe1911> tansy5Tuntun
[3:42:34] <BallisticMeerkat> i prefer to make copper cable in house as i need it on whatever offshoot of my main bus
[3:42:34] <%jarednotwithsubway> close call
[3:42:35] <amiavamp> fuck lamps, says nvg gang
[3:42:40] <%blastyoboots> @blistexthief I love how correct the term 'relapse' is for playing this game
[3:42:43] <+D00msDayDan> close coall

[3:43:35] <Expendamech> ZOOM OUT
[3:43:35] <%baka_sugoi> @SirDogBear Heaven or Hell
[3:43:37] <+DigbyMayor> SPITTERS
[3:43:37] <+sulf> they spit :)
[3:43:38] <CrimsonFox777> Seeing those inserters work so harmoniously makes me want to pick up Opus Magnum again.
[3:43:44] <%Dunmarkh> ZOOM OUT
[3:43:44] <%blastyoboots> THEY EVOlVED SPIT
[3:43:44] <hardin360> They evolve as they absorb pollution.
[3:43:44] <BallisticMeerkat> they evolve
[3:43:45] <+D00msDayDan> bugs have unlocked spitters
[3:43:46] <sailercartridge> evolution
[3:43:48] <%jarednotwithsubway> thats fuckin rad!
[3:43:48] <LVL1_Scumbag> It is
[3:43:50] <amiavamp> they get stronger over time
[3:43:51] <+fancypan> welcome to the MUTATION
[3:43:54] <EvanDude47> new mob
[3:43:54] <Shacklebox> pollution makes them stronger
[3:43:56] <ThirdPersonPhil> Make a gun and have some fun
[3:43:59] <duuupes> your pollution is making them stronger
[3:44:03] <CrimsonFox777> EVOLUTION, MY DEAR BOIVIN!
[3:44:11] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Hell yeah
[3:44:12] <rafaelba93> more pollution = stronger shit
[3:44:13] <snivins> you can destroy their nest
[3:44:14] <%blastyoboots> hahahahhaha
[3:44:15] <Shacklebox> if you zoom out you can see all of the biters
[3:44:17] <Orenjevel> they got so mad and polluted they changed their physiology
[3:44:17] <duckmeister7> YUUUUUP
[3:44:18] <%jarednotwithsubway> big tower defense vibes
[3:44:19] <+DigbyMayor> Oh yeah you can tell the devs loved starcraft
[3:44:19] <+sulf> factorio releases a lot of dopamine
[3:44:22] <amiavamp> game nreds siege tanks
[3:44:22] <%Arweynn> yesss.
[3:44:25] <munitalprats> the trees
[3:44:25] <winner_92> can you now replace all your Arm with Better Arm ?
[3:44:26] <blink289> B-but I play zerg...
[3:44:28] <+D00msDayDan> starship troopers all day
[3:44:31] <kazadaz> Oh you can build tanks in this, too
[3:44:33] <HeWhoMonologues> Those are scouts i imagine
[3:44:33] <Calek> tower defense with extra steps
[3:44:33] <+Spur3G> they eat the pollution so it goes away
[3:44:34] <skrewarrior> doesnt matter
[3:44:35] <Shacklebox> Pat is correct once again
[3:44:36] <BallisticMeerkat> its time and pollution
[3:44:40] <cochramd1992> faster arms
[3:44:43] <nauskills> Wait until bitters comes into groups of 100s
[3:44:44] <%blastyoboots> @PatStaresAt they absorb pollution like trees, but instead of dying they get Bigger Stronger
[3:44:45] <LVL1_Scumbag> They also just evolve with time
[3:44:49] <RunningNGunning> You would like They Are Billions then lol
[3:44:49] <munitalprats> look at all those withered trees, pat. the pollution will reach eventually
[3:44:50] <SirDogBear> @SirDogBear Duel 1, Lets Rock!
[3:44:53] <Expendamech> @amiavamp Factorio has artillery turrets and artillery trains.
[3:44:57] <%Dunmarkh> Pat zoom out so you don't get jumped next time
[3:45:00] <duuupes> aw man I was super wrong
[3:45:02] <%jarednotwithsubway> @PatStaresAt is this all sprite based? cuz it looks great
[3:45:03] <+Furfurlurd> Yo paticus, can you zoom out a little?
[3:45:04] <%Arweynn> when pollution touches hives it gets sucked up into two bars. mutation level and attack wave
[3:45:06] <amiavamp> @winner_92 no need to use fast arm where slow arm do good, fast arm burns more power
[3:45:08] <%blastyoboots> FACTORY MUST GROW
[3:45:14] <+b_aleph> Get rid of a couple of labs
[3:45:18] <%psydaku> psydaku subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 16 months! snyder cut spoiler cast when
[3:45:23] <kazadaz> The Tao of Factorio is realising you need to tear down your current factory if you want to increase production
[3:45:23] <+foomaster22> Ya kill their houses
[3:45:24] <rafaelba93> need MOAR production
[3:45:26] <+DigbyMayor> @jarednotwithsubway It's a mix of sprites and models.
[3:45:31] <%jarednotwithsubway> run bitch, RUN
[3:45:35] <%EternalJedi> rooScream
[3:45:37] <%Tuna_Can_0> D:
[3:45:39] <hardin360> It's fine since you'll have to move to green soon. No sense in having more red production than green.
[3:45:41] <%jarednotwithsubway> cool cool
[3:45:42] <DianaTheAscian> heh
[3:45:43] <munitalprats> see, this is just wasting boolet
[3:45:43] <HeWhoMonologues> Good work
[3:45:45] <%blastyoboots> @PatStaresAt you might wanna craft that machine gun before venturing out like that even though you're kiting them for now successfully
[3:45:53] <Orenjevel> Fly, you fools!
[3:45:55] <ThirdPersonPhil> Destroy their Homes!
[3:45:55] <%walternatorz> watch pat forget to reload
[3:45:58] <+sulf> turrets chew ammo
[3:46:02] <Shacklebox> make a machine gun buddy
[3:46:03] <munitalprats> you gotta get rid of their hives!
[3:46:07] <blink289> You ever check out that they are billions game?
[3:46:18] <%Dunmarkh> Just get both
[3:46:19] <kazadaz> shotty in this game is not that good
[3:46:19] <amiavamp> both
[3:46:20] <%blastyoboots> shotgun is pretty fun, you can switch
[3:46:20] <BallisticMeerkat> BOTH
[3:46:21] <terramagus> Shotgun is for murdering trees, SMG is for murdering bugs
[3:46:21] <AmuserName> B O T H
[3:46:22] <+DigbyMayor> Shotgun is for tree massacres
[3:46:23] <munitalprats> you can have both, make both.
[3:46:26] <Shacklebox> you can automate ammo into a box, it's easy
[3:46:26] <+Spur3G> i think the machine gun is better
[3:46:26] <sailercartridge> why not both
[3:46:27] <%blastyoboots> both are usefull
[3:46:31] <+b_aleph> submachineshotgu
[3:46:32] <SirDogBear> None, Go Melee you Coward!
[3:46:34] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt u see the name for ff14 patch 5.5 yet btw?
[3:46:38] <%Dunmarkh> psaUp
[3:46:38] <snivins> shotgun requires different ammo
[3:46:38] <%jarednotwithsubway> G U N
[3:46:39] <Orenjevel> I haven't found a use for Shotgun yet
[3:46:42] <LoneFonte> uh...
[3:46:42] <EvanDude47> you made 5 stope them!
[3:46:42] <AmuserName> NOT 5 each LUL
[3:46:43] <munitalprats> PAT YOU MADE 5 OF EACH
[3:46:46] <%TheWinged7> both is good
[3:46:46] <%TheDullaMAN> You're making 5 of each!?!
[3:46:47] <sailercartridge> why 5 of each
[3:46:47] <%ArticPath> 5x gun
[3:46:48] <Expendamech> SMG for biters. Shotgun for killing the spawners. @PatStaresAt
[3:46:52] <Shacklebox> NO
[3:46:54] <%Monkeyweed21> 10 GUNS
[3:46:55] <kazadaz> Do you?
[3:46:55] <mikkos522> shotguns better for destroying the bases
[3:46:56] <%MelBrooksKA> Gears of war?
[3:46:56] <BallisticMeerkat> filter inserter into a box
[3:46:57] <+b_aleph> JUSTICE'S ARMY!
[3:46:59] <LVL1_Scumbag> Pat trying to Saejima SMGs
[3:47:01] <%Dunmarkh> PAT NO
[3:47:01] <%Daxalog> Your making 5 shotguns!
[3:47:02] <+DigbyMayor> @Orenjevel It's real good at genociding trees
[3:47:03] <Orenjevel> PAT TOO MANY GUNS CANCEL ORDER
[3:47:03] <EvanDude47> pat stop your gun queue!
[3:47:04] <xbb1024> You're not breaching anything, so you don't need a shotgun
[3:47:05] <AmuserName> TOO MANY GUNS LUL
[3:47:08] <snivins> do you even have overflow?
[3:47:10] <sailercartridge> a gun for every finger
[3:47:10] <SirDogBear> 5x gun only? rookie numbers
[3:47:13] <Shacklebox> TOO MANY GUN
[3:47:15] <%Dunmarkh> YOU DON'T NEED THAT MANY GUNS
[3:47:21] <%Dunmarkh> YOU'RE NOT AMERICAN
[3:47:28] <%jarednotwithsubway> i need a more gun
[3:47:29] <nauskills> Need more copper on the belt
[3:47:31] <%blastyoboots> @PatStaresAt Submachine Gun is auto-targeting easy town and precise.  Shotgun does psaBIG BIG BOY DAMAGE up close and is great for hurting buildings, BUT you gotta aim, can miss, and can even hurt your own stuff in-base with shotgun pellets by accident
[3:47:31] <kazadaz> By endgame your minimap should look like a computer chip
[3:47:34] <DianaTheAscian> NO DO IT
[3:47:35] <Expendamech> Technically single player has respawns now so multiple guns is FINE. CALM DOWN CHAT. @PatStaresAt just has to remember to PUT THE SPARE GUNS IN A BOX AT THE FACTORY
[3:47:37] <BwdYeti> 10 GUNS
[3:47:37] <Orenjevel> dual wielding SMGs unlocked
[3:47:37] <%Dunmarkh> LUL
[3:47:39] <+b_aleph> LUL
[3:47:40] <BallisticMeerkat> nope
[3:47:44] <munitalprats> there is no way to destroy
[3:47:45] <iambqb> Dual wield clearly
[3:47:45] <+sulf> put into chest > destroy chest > destroys item
[3:47:45] <%ArticPath> Just Rambo it
[3:47:45] <+DSMatticus> Put in a chest, destroy the chest.
[3:47:46] <%TIME_PUNCHER> you always need more guns
[3:47:47] <%Daxalog> Why would you destroy anything?
[3:47:47] <+DigbyMayor> @PatStaresAt You can put it in a chest and shoot the chest
[3:47:49] <+grenberr1> you put it in a box and shoot it
[3:47:50] <%jarednotwithsubway> one for each hand
[3:47:50] <snivins> save one in a box for when you die
[3:47:51] <%marsantas> Put in box, shoot box
[3:47:51] <+D00msDayDan> stick it in a chest and destroy the chest
[3:47:52] <LVL1_Scumbag> Put shit into box and shoot box
[3:47:54] <mikkos522> z to drop it
[3:47:56] <+Spur3G> you can put items in a box an shoot it
[3:48:03] <SirDogBear> gotta use them gunz then CorgiDerp
[3:48:04] <munitalprats> put it in a chest and shoot it to destroy it
[3:48:05] <BwdYeti> Shoot your own things with C
[3:48:05] <%blastyoboots> @PatStaresAt The only way to attack your own stuff is hotkey C for precise-target
[3:48:05] <Shacklebox> Put it in a box, and blow it up
[3:48:06] <DianaTheAscian> EMBRACE YOUR NEIGHBORS OUTDATED RIGHTS
[3:48:10] <+sulf> C to fire
[3:48:12] <+D00msDayDan> C to friendly fire
[3:48:14] <+Jaromero435> shoot with gun
[3:48:15] <moosemonkey397> shoot it with spacebar
[3:48:16] <nauskills> C
[3:48:17] <Expendamech> @PatStaresAt RESPAWN IS IN SINGLE PLAYER. YOU NEED SPARES
[3:48:18] <%Dunmarkh> shotgun shells
[3:48:19] <%Arweynn> Make a Chest of Shame in the center of your base and put all the pistols you get on respawn in it
[3:48:20] <+Spur3G> shoot with C
[3:48:20] <amiavamp> have a dump area for items you dont want
[3:48:21] <%Landralin1996> C to force fire
[3:48:23] <EvanDude47> theres probably a decent trash bin mod out there
[3:48:27] <Shacklebox> shoot it
[3:48:29] <Psyramics> C
[3:48:33] <Orenjevel> shoot with your gun
[3:48:33] <ThirdPersonPhil> Shoot with its sibling gun
[3:48:36] <xbb1024> just leave it
[3:48:45] <SirDogBear> Pat is gonna be like Homer turning off lights with guns and opening beer cans with guns
[3:48:54] <+TheWe4pon> @PatStaresAt On your toolbar below the yellow buton is that a trash can?
[3:48:59] <+Jaromero435> hide the evidence by shooting it
[3:49:00] <kazadaz> only gun can destroy gun
[3:49:01] <BwdYeti> What a gun hero
[3:49:01] <%blastyoboots> that looked hilarious
[3:49:04] <HeWhoMonologues> Its dead Jim
[3:49:08] <+sulf> try shoot trees with ur shotgun its very effective
[3:49:11] <munitalprats> go kill those bugs
[3:49:14] <iambqb> Now the cops can never catch you
[3:49:20] <Shacklebox> which is why chests are bad and not to be trusted
[3:49:24] <sailercartridge> time to clearcut some forest with the shotgun
[3:49:27] <kazadaz> wearing FIFTY steel plats on your body
[3:49:30] <ISKMogul> There are mods which add void chests to delete items, but that's a bit cheaty.
[3:49:31] <munitalprats> YEYEYE KILL THE BUGS
[3:49:33] <amiavamp> here we go buddy
[3:49:33] <mikkos522> Get some fish
[3:49:39] <cochramd1992> dude at least put on the light armor first
[3:49:40] <BallisticMeerkat> i've played 260 hours of this game and i just found out you can destroy items NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[3:49:42] <%Monkeyweed21> SAVE
[3:49:44] <SirDogBear> This can only end well!!!
[3:49:45] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> You can bring a turret with you to make friends
[3:49:50] <Expendamech> Incoming death
[3:49:53] <Shacklebox> just hold space it'll auto shoot
[3:50:00] <munitalprats> they respawn
[3:50:08] <dmtjinni> i like this game
[3:50:14] <%TIME_PUNCHER> good thing your guy doesn't need food or water to survive I guess
[3:50:16] <BwdYeti> They respawn quick
[3:50:23] <Shacklebox> just bring a turret with you
[3:50:25] <kazadaz> Yeah turrets don't use power, you can just plonk one down and fill it with ammo anywhere...
[3:50:25] <Calek> is that a medium worm already
[3:50:25] <SirDogBear> These bugs think they hot stuff, just watch the bugs Pat gonna make with his T-virus factory!
[3:50:29] <%JoshManVGH> What if anything is gained from bug murder?
[3:50:30] <ISKMogul> If you craft a turret and place it down near the base it will help deal with them a bit, until they blow it up
[3:50:35] <%GodDougle> GodDougle subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months, currently on a 4 month streak! 
[3:50:38] <munitalprats> you have to manually aim the shotgun
[3:50:39] <nauskills> It's good for nests
[3:50:39] <%jarednotwithsubway> just gotta aim good
[3:50:43] <NeroInfinite> Those turrets are gonna just EAT your damn ammo
[3:50:43] <iambqb> Aliens respawn pretty quick, you need to take out the hives and worms for permanent damage
[3:50:44] <LoneFonte> LEAVE
[3:50:44] <TigerClaws12> LUL
[3:50:44] <%Arweynn> yeah shotgun bad
[3:50:46] <mikkos522> Shotgun is for destroying the bases
[3:50:46] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Bring a turret to clear out nests
[3:50:49] <BlueLunecy> Gotta aim
[3:50:54] <+meisnewbie> shotgun is the most efficient damage on the spawner per research
[3:50:54] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Shotgawns are better for bases anyway
[3:50:56] <%AncelDeLambert> this is why you don't bother until you have grenades
[3:50:57] <DrJamesWoods> seems like need bigg gun
[3:50:58] <Shacklebox> shotgun for buildings
[3:51:04] <kazadaz> i warned you man
[3:51:05] <Expendamech> @PatStaresAt Shotgun is for killing the buildings.
[3:51:11] <ThirdPersonPhil> There is mad packs in this game right?
[3:51:13] <+sulf> u can grab fish out of water to heal
[3:51:15] <slix3431> "You wanna piece of me boy?"
[3:51:20] <MagicHatss> the power of technology
[3:51:30] <EvanDude47> pat you are dying
[3:51:34] <%blastyoboots> @PatStaresAt always save before leaving base to alien hunt, if you die you lose your entire inventory irrecoverably
[3:51:35] <bywayIdler> Shotgun does BIG BOY DAMAGE, but it doesn't auto-aim.
[3:51:37] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Just build a turret here and coal power it with your overabundance of coal
[3:51:38] <%Daxalog> Might want to retreat
[3:51:38] <duuupes> wow shotguns are bad huh
[3:51:39] <sendart> Take a turret over there
[3:51:40] <iambqb> You can go fishing for some healing items
[3:51:42] <%Dunmarkh> retreat and heal
[3:51:43] <munitalprats> well, you got rid of one
[3:51:45] <mikkos522> Fish good
[3:51:52] <+D00msDayDan> @blastyoboots that's not true, your shit drops where you died
[3:51:55] <LVL1_Scumbag> Did you enjoy your friends?
[3:51:56] <EvanDude47> you killed 1 of the 3 nests
[3:51:57] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Bring backup?
[3:51:59] <scrimscromble> fade to blacktorio
[3:51:59] <SirDogBear> Mission Failed Allies Lose BibleThump
[3:52:00] <%Broand> You can pick up fish from a pond and eat it to heal
[3:52:02] <kazadaz> Put down a bunker (i.e. turret) right outside their base
[3:52:03] <cochramd1992> made some progress
[3:52:03] <%TIME_PUNCHER> the lesson is to never try
[3:52:06] <amiavamp> need steel boolet and grenada
[3:52:12] <ISKMogul> Go craft some turrets and place them down nearby first.
[3:52:17] <%blastyoboots> @D00msDayDan really? that's new...
[3:52:20] <CrimsonFox777> What we discovered is to always bring more bullets.
[3:52:20] <munitalprats> the lesson is bring back more gun
[3:52:27] <+sulf> yoinking off the line i see, a classic
[3:52:27] <NeroInfinite> This is why you build a turret near the aliens
[3:52:28] <%Dunmarkh> @D00msDayDan you only play multiplayer?
[3:52:30] <sailercartridge> bullets stack at 200
[3:52:30] <SirDogBear> 5x guns not enough, Pat needed 50x guns BibleThump
[3:52:40] <munitalprats> because gun didnt work, just use more gun.
[3:52:40] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt you can put down turrets at the base
[3:52:42] <sendart> YES
[3:52:45] <AmuserName> Pocket-Turret like an Engineer
[3:52:47] <%blastyoboots> @D00msDayDan maybe not in single player then freeplay
[3:52:48] <kazadaz> Hey Pat, I think your factory is starved of copper plates RN
[3:52:49] <%Daxalog> Make turret place ammo
[3:52:51] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> 100%
[3:52:52] <+Onionchamp> if you load it fast enough
[3:52:53] <%Dunmarkh> yeah, but you need to load it fast
[3:52:54] <ISKMogul> just place ammo in it manually
[3:52:55] <iambqb> You can, but you need multiple turrets, one ain't gonna do it
[3:52:57] <Shacklebox> yes
[3:52:58] <LVL1_Scumbag> Turret creep is super legit
[3:52:58] <%blastyoboots> @PatStaresAt it is if you're fast enough
[3:52:58] <+DSMatticus> Turret leapfrog is super effective.
[3:52:59] <%marsantas> Yeah, just bring turret and ammo
[3:52:59] <xbb1024> power?
[3:53:00] <munitalprats> Turrets dont use power, they absolutely can work. you're TF2's ENGINEER
[3:53:01] <amiavamp> yes, be a tower rushing asshole
[3:53:09] <snivins> why not, turrets work on hatred alone
[3:53:10] <%blastyoboots> @PatStaresAt SAVESCUM IT
[3:53:16] <Orenjevel> Don't forget that you can shove raw fish in your mouth to heal while you shoot
[3:53:18] <%Dunmarkh> LUL
[3:53:18] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Great execution
[3:53:21] <bywayIdler> Gun turrets don't need power, only ammo.
[3:53:22] <NeroInfinite> Yes.
[3:53:25] <segychan> poggers
[3:53:26] <terramagus> Doom dounstrack intensifies
[3:53:27] <BurningAc3s> hahahaha pat into the sims! long live Elmo and big Z
[3:53:28] <albret__einstrong> dead
[3:53:31] <%scallycap> this rules
[3:53:36] <rafaelba93> destroy nest
[3:53:42] <DianaTheAscian> wow
[3:53:44] <Orenjevel> close one
[3:53:49] <BwdYeti> MORE DAKKA
[3:53:50] <iambqb> The safe strat is to build a turret within a turrets radius to push
[3:53:55] <%blastyoboots> OH NO THE TARGETING PRIORITY
[3:53:57] <%jarednotwithsubway> brrrrrrrrrrrrrr
[3:53:58] <munitalprats> DAKKA
[3:53:59] <+sulf> nice
[3:54:01] <AmuserName> DAKA DAKA
[3:54:05] <segychan> @PatStaresAt Yo I bought Satisfactory cause of you and dumped 50 hours into it already. Would I like this fallout lookin game?

[3:54:10] <%AzureGale> DAKKA DAKKA DAKKA DAKKA DAKKA
[3:54:10] <DianaTheAscian> LETS GOOOOO
[3:54:11] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Evolve, beasts
[3:54:12] <+Furfurlurd> LITERALLY PROTOSS TURRET CHEESE!
[3:54:15] <Shacklebox> noice
[3:54:16] <Paperware> Mmmm...genocide
[3:54:18] <%Dunmarkh> you're safe for now
[3:54:19] <sailercartridge> neighbours will now be stronger
[3:54:21] <ThirdPersonPhil> Now we are free to Polute!
[3:54:22] <+sulf> dont worry they move back in eventually, thats what expansion is
[3:54:26] <terramagus> Now pave over their home and build a Walmart
[3:54:29] <hardin360> Probably want to build a couple radar.
[3:54:30] <SirDogBear> For HUMANITY!!!!
[3:54:30] <%Tearonex> that solves that problem
[3:54:36] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> You're an engineer, not a super soldier, fight with your class strengths
[3:54:45] <%MelBrooksKA> Man 1, nature 0
[3:54:47] <%legendfather_of_giants> cannon rushing a zerg? WTF their creep spread sucks
[3:54:48] <%blastyoboots> @PatStaresAt hey guess what, the only thing that speeds up their evolution faster than pollution is killing their bases! congratulation! :D
[3:54:51] <ISKMogul> And now the armored biters begin
[3:55:05] <+DSMatticus> @segychan Factorio is the OG. It's different because it's topdown, but it's super good. And the fact that it is topdown and HAS COPY PASTE makes it much easier to build big crazy shit.
[3:55:06] <DianaTheAscian> yeah your not making enough
[3:55:10] <slix3431> Pat is Pro-colonialism
[3:55:12] <munitalprats> @blastyoboots bro, they were going to attack eventually. killing them is fine.
[3:55:23] <kazadaz> Gotta start researching again too
[3:55:25] <SirDogBear> Starship Troopers just needed to invest more in turrets rather than ships and mobile infantry CorgiDerp
[3:55:32] <munitalprats> You're going nuts over it when the biters have to go eventually.
[3:55:33] <%jarednotwithsubway> the background music is very ominous and spooky, i like it
[3:55:35] <segychan> @DSMatticus PogChamp
[3:55:37] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[3:55:41] <snivins> yes thats thw way
[3:55:42] <%blastyoboots> @munitalprats no killing them WAS the right thing to do, I just want to scare him, with the TRUTH
[3:55:43] <LVL1_Scumbag> Pat gon  die
[3:55:46] <sendart> might have been wise to build more turrets lol
[3:55:48] <DianaTheAscian> manifest?
[3:55:55] <kazadaz> dakka dakka dakka dakka
[3:55:59] <%jarednotwithsubway> thats so good
[3:56:02] <Shacklebox> The biters will be all like "You fool! I was holding them back!"
[3:56:02] <munitalprats> gonna run out of bullet
[3:56:04] <%Dunmarkh> MANIFEST DESTINY PAT
[3:56:09] <+sulf> +

[3:56:23] <kazadaz> Manifest Factory
[3:56:25] <SirDogBear> Pat wipes out one bug colony and now he got that murder boner for more imperialism Mau5
[3:56:31] <iambqb> You wanna build a repair kit if you don't got one
[3:56:32] <%Dunmarkh> You should really build some repair packs
[3:56:53] <%blastyoboots> @PatStaresAt build repair kits to repair turret, or more turret
[3:56:55] <munitalprats> Turrets need to be rrepaired
[3:56:59] <%doc_ock_rokc> Should have brought more gun

[3:57:17] <+Furfurlurd> F
[3:57:19] <+meisnewbie> did pat build the new armor
[3:57:20] <%AzureGale> YOU DEID
[3:57:26] <Orenjevel> Bad luck.
[3:57:28] <%Dunmarkh> corpse run time
[3:57:30] <cochramd1992> @meisnewbie no
[3:57:30] <DianaTheAscian> they're gone
[3:57:31] <+Romuken> The Corp will be sure to take that clone out of your pay.
[3:57:33] <+fancypan> You can go back to grab your stuff
[3:57:33] <Shacklebox> Guess what, you lost everything you were carrying!
[3:57:36] <munitalprats> time to corpse run
[3:57:37] <iambqb> your coprse has your loot
[3:57:37] <%Daxalog> "Well guys im gonna call it"
[3:57:42] <LoneFonte> good
[3:57:43] <EvanDude47> thats the best part!
[3:57:44] <%Mrbaconator> like spaghetti ya
[3:57:45] <%blastyoboots> YEAH it does right?? it's GREAT
[3:57:46] <%Daxalog> People refer to their factories as microchips
[3:57:48] <kazadaz> it'll be a 3080 by the end of the game
[3:57:49] <+meisnewbie> the body exists for 15 minutes before it despawns IIRC
[3:57:52] <%Daxalog> Or mother boards
[3:57:52] <LVL1_Scumbag> Isn't it great?
[3:57:52] <%JoshManVGH> Hey you cleared out all the extra stuff at lrast
[3:57:55] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt thats the goal
[3:57:55] <Expendamech> This is why i said "Put the spares in a box, you'll need them"
[3:57:56] <Shacklebox> IT'S GREAT RIGHT?
[3:58:01] <GunEden> eventually it will turn into drone hive
[3:58:05] <A0N33> It looks a hell of a lot better than my first few factories, though.
[3:58:09] <munitalprats> if you dont pick up your items they'll despawn
[3:58:10] <SirDogBear> Thus Pat's War Against the Bugs ended as well as the results of the Great Emu War BibleThump
[3:58:21] <+Furfurlurd> Pat research!
[3:58:21] <LVL1_Scumbag> Need moar
[3:58:24] <%ArticPath> Worth looking at the Production screen with P to see the numbers
[3:58:31] <HeWhoMonologues> A few more then?
[3:58:36] <A0N33> You don't have enough furnaces, 1 electric drill can feed 2 stone furnaces.
[3:58:36] <NeroInfinite> the research
[3:58:50] <hardin360> 2 smelters per miner if I remember correctly.
[3:59:27] <+silentblast93> hey pat hows the factory?
[3:59:28] <munitalprats> yup
[3:59:35] <kazadaz> Burner are early-game only.  NOrmal and Long are 90% of the game
[3:59:39] <xbb1024> ahh, I see. shared belt
[3:59:43] <LVL1_Scumbag> And that's not even all of them
[3:59:47] <%ZeOrbling> but wait, theres more psaDab
[3:59:48] <munitalprats> pat, your items are gonna despawn
[3:59:48] <%blastyoboots> @PatStaresAt try a fast inserter before you're done
[3:59:51] <Case_Ah_Dia> thats alot of insertion
[3:59:55] <EvanDude47> research the better smelters
[3:59:56] <%marsantas> There are better smelters later
[3:59:59] <+Furfurlurd> Research better smelters.
[4:00:06] <hardin360> Then get to electric smelters
[4:00:07] <%BoxNavy> smellers
[4:00:14] <Shacklebox> You'll get better ones soon enough
[4:00:16] <GunEden> you can rush through electric smelters
[4:00:20] <munitalprats> then produce more iron plates! iron is super important
[4:00:23] <snivins> you got more iron ore to mine
[4:00:24] <SirDogBear> You also need more gun turrets! PogChamp
[4:00:27] <LVL1_Scumbag> So make more plates
[4:00:28] <thunka10> the jokes write themselves
[4:00:34] <Orenjevel> Full electric smelters fucked me up, i had so many systems in place to deliver fuel to each of them
[4:00:34] <%AzureGale> Long inserter is looooooooooooong
[4:00:37] <+Jaromero435> long pulls from 2 spaces away
[4:00:43] <iambqb> Yeah this game is always pushing you to scale up production
[4:00:46] <+Furfurlurd> Pat research something!
[4:00:50] <%Ozavic> Had a good time, but time for me to go sleep, having a 9-5 schedule is rough when you're a night owl. Later Pat and Chat!
[4:01:17] <SirCacaPee> Good bye everyone
[4:01:19] <HeWhoMonologues> Laters
[4:01:22] <extradopeness> ok but does it do the work good
[4:01:40] <kazadaz> good idea
[4:01:43] <DianaTheAscian> yeyeye
[4:01:49] <%jarednotwithsubway> big FAST
[4:01:49] <%blastyoboots> it's FUCKIN FAST
[4:01:55] <amiavamp> fyi filter is same speed as fast
[4:01:56] <cochramd1992> now replace all the other ones
[4:01:57] <PlushMayhem> fast inserter go brrrrr
[4:01:58] <sailercartridge> fast costs more power
[4:02:01] <+Furfurlurd> pat you need to research new knowledge.
[4:02:17] <Orenjevel> It's certainly worth upgrading on your quicker machines
[4:02:26] <mikkos522> more science go
[4:02:28] <$Dakuu75> @PatStaresAt isn't it super late for you right now?
[4:02:29] <amiavamp> you get even faster ones later
[4:02:30] <slix3431> GO FASTA! SMOrc
[4:02:39] <%blastyoboots> they don't need fast, as you'll see quick
[4:02:39] <%JoshManVGH> why is a chunk of the factory not moving?
[4:02:45] <kazadaz> It won't make a difference.  Those furnaces are limited by their own speed, not by their inputs or outputs
[4:02:47] <hardin360> Bottleneck is the number of smelters, not inserters.
[4:03:00] <rafaelba93> you can build on top of the old ones right?
[4:03:03] <munitalprats> yeah, the smelters are the  bottleneck
[4:03:04] <Shacklebox> nah, your point of failure is smelters not inserters
[4:03:08] <Orenjevel> Speen!
[4:03:16] <+DSMatticus> Those fast inserters won't do anything, because the furnaces aren't fast enough to need the extra iron.
[4:03:20] <%blastyoboots> more smelters needed, more furnaces
[4:03:20] <+Furfurlurd> Pat the research!
[4:03:24] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt fast inserters don't really do anything on stone furnaces because input/output is on a normal inserter's rate.
[4:03:27] <MagicHatss> you need more smelters to keep up with the output of resources
[4:03:33] <BallisticMeerkat> @PatStaresAt do some research, Always be doing research
[4:03:33] <cochramd1992> furnace is the limiting factor, you need faster furnaces
[4:03:43] <kazadaz> The fancy arms have their place, but ifyou want to increase production, you just need more furnaces and miners
[4:03:46] <munitalprats> and smelters make more pollution!
[4:03:46] <%JoshManVGH> only two of the circuit board assemblers are running
[4:04:10] <%JoshManVGH> oh cause got it
[4:04:21] <slix3431> GO BIGGAH! SMOrc
[4:04:23] <%Roasted_Pheasant> ⭐ 🌟 🧠 ⭐ 🌠
[4:04:36] <hardin360> If yo have an inserter one space past the belt it will still pull from it.
[4:04:39] <+captain_thickthighs> I was wondering with this that again does the mind goblins turn into like a superpower?
[4:05:05] <%blastyoboots> MOOORE.gif
[4:05:34] <+willsg98> hey there, just stopping by to say hi. i need to go sleep. Have fun with whatever you're doing!
[4:05:35] <+MisterAvry> they're good
[4:05:37] <+Furfurlurd> @PatStaresAt Dont forget to research!
[4:05:38] <%blastyoboots> fast inserters are so damn satisfying
[4:05:45] <MagicHatss> it's speed
[4:05:51] <+captain_thickthighs> hey is the video skipping for anybody else
[4:05:51] <%scallycap> yeah that doesnt help
[4:05:51] <%Dunmarkh> oh definitely
[4:05:53] <kazadaz> Yeah it's not a nice spawn
[4:05:54] <DianaTheAscian> its kinda funny
[4:05:56] <pth88> time to learn filters
[4:05:57] <Slim_Lipid> s p e e d
[4:05:57] <rafaelba93> some distance would be nice
[4:05:57] <slix3431> GET BIGGA NODES! SMOrc
[4:05:59] <snivins> nah
[4:05:59] <sendart> I like the labs that are sitting around doing nothing
[4:06:02] <%AncelDeLambert> ... why is he putting wire in a box?
[4:06:05] <Shacklebox> yeah, that's a little weird
[4:06:09] <iambqb> underground belts help a lot to handle space constraints
[4:06:10] <%marsantas> Well you SHOULD have learned from Satisfactory to not build this close to your node
[4:06:10] <munitalprats> i mean you had an annoying spawn from starting in the desert anyway
[4:06:14] <%AzureGale> I ship Coal/Copper
[4:06:15] <%AncelDeLambert> oh, that's.. plates?
[4:06:17] <%doc_ock_rokc> Gief agrees
[4:06:19] <rafaelba93> you have space to just build new stuff
[4:06:21] <A0N33> It's pretty annoying, but sorters help since they can be used to filter.
[4:06:21] <snivins> green goo
[4:06:24] <%EternalJedi> limesD BORK
[4:06:25] <%blastyoboots> SO FUN
[4:06:26] <Shacklebox> Your spawn was all kinds of fucky tbh
[4:06:27] <+foomaster22> Robots

[4:06:38] <ergulor> worms
[4:06:38] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt You store any science packs in boxes so they keep producing even if the belt is backed up. You'll need literally hundreds of thousands of them.

[4:06:45] <%blastyoboots> Blueprints!!!!
[4:06:46] <%Daxalog> Blueprints
[4:06:46] <sailercartridge> blueprints
[4:06:48] <iambqb> robots are the future

[4:06:49] <%Arweynn> THE FACTORY MUST GROW
[4:06:50] <snivins> ctrl + c
[4:06:51] <LVL1_Scumbag> robots
[4:06:52] <BallisticMeerkat> ghost building
[4:06:53] <DuoScratch> you can make patterns, and place them downf or the bots to build out of chests you have the supplies in.
[4:06:53] <hardin360> Blueprints
[4:06:53] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Ghosts and blueprints
[4:06:53] <%blastyoboots> you can COPY AND PASTE
[4:06:54] <h8t0r_m4rs> F U T U R E
[4:06:58] <+meisnewbie> you can build ghosts, which the bots fill out for you from specific chests
[4:06:58] <Shacklebox> You make blueprints
[4:06:59] <ergulor> the future is now
[4:07:00] <Captain_Joe1911> BOP tansy5Tuntun
[4:07:03] <kazadaz> adios
[4:07:07] <HeWhoMonologues> Noice
[4:07:08] <+captain_thickthighs> fuck if I knoe
[4:07:08] <%Dunmarkh> Also you didn't save your game pat.
[4:07:09] <LoneFonte> DID YOU HAVE FUN?
[4:07:09] <%JoshManVGH> Woo!
[4:07:11] <%Monkeyweed21> YOU CAN AUTOMATE GROWTH
[4:07:11] <+sulf> consoom product pog
[4:07:12] <+DSMatticus> Satisfactory needs copy and paste. It's the one thing it's missing. Pisses me off.
[4:07:18] <+DrSmashy> you did good, pat
[4:07:21] <%Broand> aaa
[4:07:22] <%Dunmarkh> oh that's cool
[4:07:25] <rafaelba93> nice stream :)
[4:07:25] <+D00msDayDan> nice
[4:07:28] <%Dunmarkh> psaUp
[4:07:28] <Nordguy> EEEEEEUUUURGH DELUBRUM
[4:07:32] <+fancypan> nah you did good for a first run
[4:07:38] <Shacklebox> for the best your spawn sucked ass
[4:07:43] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Stand on a box and copy-paste
[4:07:43] <+sulf> dont restart that was good
[4:07:45] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt have fun being dead on the floor
[4:07:52] <sailercartridge> robots can build using items from a box
[4:07:56] <%Broand> That's what the drones are for
[4:07:57] <+sulf> keep pushing with your save and take it was far as u can go
[4:07:59] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Bots can pull material from boxes
[4:08:04] <%blastyoboots> constructors aren't that expensive, and you can have larger piles of concrete now right?
[4:08:06] <amiavamp> They could make it pull from storage like factorio does
[4:08:07] <+D00msDayDan> you should definitely make sure your starting area is forestated next time, you can preview the world before you generate it
[4:08:09] <+captain_thickthighs> no man's sky has that
[4:08:10] <%Broand> no I mean the drones in factorio
[4:08:11] <BwdYeti> The drones can build using items from chests
[4:08:15] <+DSMatticus> Inventory upgrades as you play, so presumably by the time you were copy-pasting big factory segments you should have enough space?
[4:08:16] <xbb1024> Maybe copy and paste an outline, and you got to complete it when you get the resources
[4:08:16] <+sulf> most people quit when they get to oil, first real wall
[4:08:20] <%Dunmarkh> you can have a whole flying logistics network
[4:08:23] <Case_Ah_Dia> @Case_Ah_Dia is new here. Say hello! HeyGuys
[4:08:27] <Shacklebox> Drones grab from drone boxes
[4:08:30] <+Jaromero435> How do you feel about these types of games that have characters you need to protect? IE Rimworld, Kenshi, etc
[4:08:36] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt Drones are like Starcraft workers and the minerals are any item in the game.
[4:08:36] <%blastyoboots> yeah Pat in factorio your drones can literally pull from STORAGE to build the blueprints you throw down, it's fucking INCREDIBLE
[4:08:41] <+sulf> logistics network? :)
[4:08:42] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> You can do that in factorio
[4:08:42] <+TheWe4pon> End of day 2 thoughts on Factorio? like? hate?
[4:08:56] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Do what you want, but don't worry about making mistakes, its pretty forgiving as is, and if you need it to be more so you can turn on peaceful
[4:09:02] <Shacklebox> auto builder
[4:09:07] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Uhh, you kind of do
[4:09:08] <%Broand> Oh yeah that'd be a thingh
[4:09:13] <+D00msDayDan> i could see satisfactory adding a tag you add to storage containers that allows drones to pull from them
[4:09:14] <fojidoj> Have the amount you can copy be based on your current inventory
[4:09:14] <%blastyoboots> @PatStaresAt there's "logistics provider storage chests" that your drones have access to
[4:09:16] <%Broand> I think modded minecraft has something like that
[4:09:19] <+sulf> i wish satisfactory was flat and infinite
[4:09:24] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt You can become a carrier to the drones if you get the correct armor equipment.
[4:09:35] <DianaTheAscian> and the map isn't random
[4:10:07] <+sulf> enemy density becomes exponential past your initial bubble of safety pat
[4:10:16] <+D00msDayDan> i hope someday satisfactory adds random map generation, playing the same map every time gets old once you've solved it
[4:10:18] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Or to place blueprint ghosts
[4:10:23] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Check out Satisfactory modding?
[4:10:32] <%blastyoboots> @sulf but resources are denser too~
[4:10:42] <+meisnewbie> eventually you get crazy weapons to deal with that density of enemies
[4:10:42] <+sulf> also T R A I NS
[4:10:43] <Shacklebox> It'll get there
[4:10:49] <+sulf> cant wait to see you lose ur mind figuring trains out
[4:10:51] <BwdYeti> Just means time for TANKS
[4:10:55] <+D00msDayDan> @sulf TRAAAAAAINS
[4:10:58] <+sulf> that could be a whole game by itself
[4:11:06] <@SoFarFetched> Sunday
[4:11:06] <amiavamp> trains are real fun tho
[4:11:07] <@SoFarFetched> I think

[4:14:47] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt will we ever see that old picture of Elmo pissed off in a Christmas sweater?
[4:14:47] <MementoAnxius> OH GOD FACTRIO? @PatStaresAt DOES UR BRAIN HURT YET? NotLikeThis
[4:14:55] <+CPEthos> Building is bigger on the inside
[4:14:58] <xbb1024> inside of inside
[4:14:59] <%Dunmarkh> buildings inside of buildings
[4:15:00] <HeWhoMonologues> Doesnt mean it keeps going smaller and smaller
[4:15:01] <ThirdPersonPhil> no like inception
[4:15:04] <%Livelinne> PrideRise
[4:15:05] <+CPEthos> And you can put more inside of it
[4:15:06] <einSynd> Recursive is like, repeating forever
[4:15:07] <%blastyoboots> @PatStaresAt recursively means Build Factory Inside Factory Inside Factory Inside...
[4:15:08] <+DSMatticus> Recursively: I put a building inside the building inside the building inside the building inside the building...
[4:15:11] <HeWhoMonologues> Ah, got it
[4:15:12] <EvanDude47> recursive = factory builds a factory builds a factory etc
[4:15:12] <BwdYeti> Factory inside factory inside factory inside...
[4:15:18] <+allups> is the stream done?
[4:15:25] <%AyotoCorp> Recursion: See also: Recursion
[4:15:27] <muniea5> Factorio? oh noooo
[4:15:27] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt Inception is what recursion is
[4:15:32] <NeroInfinite> Googlle it
[4:15:34] <BwdYeti> Factorissimo is pretty sick
[4:15:43] <%Dunmarkh> no they aren't
[4:15:46] <skrewarrior> they are not lol
[4:15:47] <HeWhoMonologues> You can only build out
[4:15:48] <DianaTheAscian> on build out
[4:15:51] <MementoAnxius> factorio made my brain hurt :)
[4:15:52] <%Dunmarkh> you'll run out
[4:15:54] <DianaTheAscian> only*
[4:15:56] <+DSMatticus> Satisfactory doesn't have any enemies, and it has vertical building. You can basically ALWAYS solve the problem, and you have INFINITE time to do so.
[4:15:58] <%asgard147> KITTY! limesAw psaWink
[4:16:05] <+D00msDayDan> no verticality means you need to go WIIIIIIDE
[4:16:07] <EvanDude47> you can build one layer down
[4:16:09] <%CommanderSqueaks> Become wide, never become tall.
[4:16:09] <ThirdPersonPhil> building up is a Scam
