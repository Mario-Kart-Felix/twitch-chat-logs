[0:10:32] <leroyslammin> Don't LERP my man.
[0:10:32] <hntronium> "Rotation Lerp: The higher the number, the faster the player can alter the facing direction, making it easier to aim and to control the character. However, if an advanced player wants to aim with more accuracy, this feature will become a handicap (as it may disrupt a player's reaction speed). Lower the number for better control of your character.

[0:18:12] <+StrawberryPantsu> I only feel EDF is only good when the frame rate is shitting the bed
[0:18:13] <leroyslammin> The Imperial Guard could learn a thing or two about Morale from the EDF
[0:18:17] <+HypotheticalWalrus> Yes but without any irony
[0:18:19] <%SirGO0SE> except less tiddies
[0:18:19] <Reisadan> And then Insect Armageddon managed to get literally everything about EDF exactly WRONG.
[0:18:20] <Daxalog> Except not in space
[0:18:24] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> without the misguided undertones
[0:18:25] <%AncelDeLambert> basically, but without the fascism and colonialism
[0:18:25] <%SirGO0SE> OH MAN remember the tiddy
[0:18:26] <%vaporousTippler> The movie, not the book.
[0:18:26] <aero160h> Oh that's even better lol
[0:18:28] <dredshift> Starship Troopers without the satire

[0:18:30] <+Voroth> EDF! EDF! EDF!
[0:18:35] <digaogrunge> RICO
[0:18:36] <laserbeaming> It's starship troopers without the political commentary
[0:18:36] <AMajorTom> no shower scene tho
[0:18:37] <InugamiTheHound> Two days ago my brother died, next day my lover fell Today everyone was almost killed in that we must not dwell
[0:18:40] <xoyv> actually edf is the INVERSION of starship troopers, instead of us going to the bugs, they come to us
[0:18:43] <King_Wolf_Rigger> The EDF song almost sounds like the Marine's Hymn

[0:19:00] <dredshift> Well actually, without the satire it's spot-on for the book Starship Troopers was based on/satirizing.
[0:19:01] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> HE DOESN'T KNOW
[0:19:03] <+ProvingVirus> storm 1 could beat doomguy

[0:55:11] <%CJett92> Nah, do it, Fuck chat
[0:55:12] <%SirGO0SE> it already sucks for the podcast

[0:55:14] <AmericanaRed> FUCK EA
[0:55:15] <%GarbageQueenEllie> It's fine
[0:55:15] <%Savarro> @AngriestPat don't get me wrong, I'm subbed to both...but having the chat alongside you is super important for me

[0:55:16] <%fFailureatlife> wait thats a thing?
[0:55:17] <runsoverfrogs> Scumbag move
[0:55:17] <TigerClaws12> shoulda negotiated
[0:55:19] <%doc_ock_rokc> I wish to see the chat because your chat is your costar
[0:55:21] <hntronium> Chat wants to see itself
[0:55:22] <GreyFoxHoundDD> Oh yeah, also, fuck youtube
[0:55:22] <%GingaNZ> its already like that for the podcast, thats probably enough
[0:55:23] <%alcors_wisdom> i mean i would rather you not but do what you gotta do my guy
[0:55:23] <SubjectX07x> Chat is part of the experience.
[0:55:23] <%Sovspot> thats how your podcast is and i hate it
[0:55:23] <+Darren716> Also twitch saves where you left off if you watched live
[0:55:24] <spinalwizard> that too
[0:55:25] <zenith0111> it's cool
[0:55:25] <MoonObscure> :O
[0:55:26] <WhereIsWill> ! SWEATING ENDS !
[0:55:26] <%CJett92> Do it for the lols
[0:55:26] <jogaflame> cmonBruh
[0:55:27] <%fFailureatlife> also watching twitch streams without chat is annoying
[0:55:28] <%terminallyCapriciousz> Yeah, they do that for the podcast
[0:55:29] <Renkage> @AngriestPat Which soldier are you looking at playing. If you have an idea?
[0:55:30] <xoyv> pat gotta combo those tatty mats
[0:55:30] <$starotter70> Get Dat bag

[0:55:32] <%Gray_skies1993> apatElmo apatElmo
[0:55:32] <HollowMan190> not seeing the chat....not exactly a negative
[0:55:34] <Luesagna00> ...what fucking really?.?? thats way it takes acouple days for youtube stuff?? never knew
[0:55:34] <%CommanderSqueaks> Cheer100 The biggest problem with YouTube is you can't see the glorious Twitch Chat like with VODs.
[0:55:35] <+Darren716> So if you stop watching mid stream you can go back
[0:55:37] <%ECRead> yeah lack of chat does suck on YouTube
[0:55:37] <%fFailureatlife> i only watch VoDS
[0:55:37] <%happyface699> apatBlep apatBlep apatBlep apatBlep apatBlep apatBlep
[0:55:38] <%connos_procrastination> Yeah vod chat can be hilarious
[0:55:42] <JaeStereo> I have almost nothing to watch nowadays
[0:55:44] <suikudo> Do you need more money that bad?
[0:55:45] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Thank you for not going with that, I come back to these vods rather than the youtube ones because I can get to see the twitch chat reaction live
[0:55:46] <+Spec7re> Pats not playing the game today apparently this is just a casual stream
[0:55:49] <MoonObscure> WOAH

[0:56:43] <BappoSama> I do wonder why the Podcast is sub only for VODS, but i assume it's because of the incentive to just sub to the channel.
[0:56:44] <%alcors_wisdom> i mean i like keeping it open but its your content so do as you like
[0:56:45] <%Agami23> @AngriestPat the problem with sub only vods is that they make it so no clips are allowed, and you cant see chat in the vod

[1:23:22] <%yeknomlive> which edf do you guys recommend
[1:23:24] <+Higgsworth> It is kinda low, but it doesn't matter

[1:23:39] <zenith0111> Civilian???????
[1:23:40] <%goose_attack_almanac> EDF
[1:23:41] <InugamiTheHound> To take down giant insects who came down from outer space We now head underground for their path we must retrace And find their giant nest and crush the queen's carapace The E.D.F. deploys
[1:23:41] <%Broand> But the second verse of the regular song says "vicious giant insects who have once again come back" which hasn't happened yet
[1:23:41] <RazielTheDark> You will also get to summon vehicles as a Ranger too, not just the Air Raider gets to summon vehicles
[1:23:42] <%ArcanumMBD> apatBig and STRONG
[1:23:44] <AMajorTom> Mission cleared somehow
[1:23:45] <%foreverN2dust> @CommanderSqueaks it's worth it, have you played them?
[1:23:45] <%SergeantSov> @yeknomlive 5 or Iron Rain.
[1:23:46] <sonofthedeepsouth> BIG AND STRONG
[1:23:50] <hntronium> Time to kill giants
[1:23:54] <%SirGO0SE> then god damn it ill DOUBLE FULLSCREEN IT
[1:23:56] <%CommanderSqueaks> @foreverN2dust This is my first time ever seeing gameplay.
[1:23:57] <Miss_Ebola> Nope
[1:23:59] <%SergeantSov> No.
[1:24:00] <jogaflame> Holy shit the Jank this game brings is incredible
[1:24:01] <%Bearphonics> Bearphonics subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months! 
[1:24:02] <Rashnam> nope
[1:24:02] <%CommanderSqueaks> The ass camera sprint?
[1:24:02] <%alcors_wisdom> heads up you wont get the really goofy weapons unless you play hardmode
[1:24:02] <Belutima> @AngriestPat compared to your voice when you talk, the game is pretty low, can hardly hear them when you talk.
[1:24:02] <%ArcanumMBD> sprint is Ranger only
[1:24:03] <snake_zen> no
[1:24:03] <%Solidnick18> no
[1:24:03] <%Black_Machete> no
[1:24:04] <Renkage> Nope
[1:24:06] <+punit216> they have other stuff
[1:24:06] <Fujiwara_92> no
[1:24:06] <RazielTheDark> Only the Ranger has the sprint
[1:24:09] <%furiousfurioso> the mech one can do sick rocket leaps
[1:24:11] <InugamiTheHound> no that's only for the solider class
[1:24:12] <DSD24> Can you customize how your Ranger looks?
[1:24:12] <%ProvingVirus> it's just ranger that has the sprint
[1:24:13] <TURBOSUPLEX3000> wing diver has a dash
[1:24:13] <Rashnam> fencers get boosts
[1:24:14] <+zetaplus> the way I see it, the song isn't great because thithis is the universe's first song until they change it to the better song.
[1:24:18] <Tucker0603> fencer is the best character
[1:24:20] <Renkage> It's a unique Ranger mechanic
[1:24:21] <sileo_patronus> @AngriestPat no but wing diver gets an airdash
[1:24:22] <%ArcanumMBD> Air Raider can manually control airstrikes now
[1:24:22] <Kazuhira_Boat> just rangers sprint
[1:24:24] <FrozenMonkey> E D F
[1:24:24] <%Halowood> Wing Diver has an air dash tho
[1:24:25] <vulkans2> they have different movement abilites
[1:24:29] <Solokaldaka> all the classes have there own gather ability
[1:24:29] <%debugdrawray_> why does your character look like tommy wiseau
[1:24:29] <+d00msdaydan> crank up the voice volume because that's the part that matters
[1:24:33] <%Solidnick18> fencer is the best but really hard to use
[1:24:40] <Ninja_Kareca> @angriestpat STEP 2: ascend from darkness!!!!
[1:24:46] <haitakaa> Eagle Diaper Funeral 5
[1:24:47] <SulfurousAcid> just do your first playthrough as ranger
[1:24:47] <Renkage> Fencer is the best once you learn the hidden tech
[1:24:49] <%SergeantSov> Every character has a different Mobility feature, except the Air Raider
[1:24:51] <%foreverN2dust> @CommanderSqueaks if you don't see anything that peaks your interest go watch some videos of 4.1's air raider after stream and that will sell you on the game
[1:24:53] <%ProvingVirus> Fencer is the fastest class by far, believe it or not
[1:25:05] <InugamiTheHound> why not jumping A button?
[1:25:06] <%SergeantSov> Fencer is obnoxiously good
[1:25:08] <RazielTheDark> Yeah Air Raider is old Ranger to a degree XD
[1:25:12] <lTaunto> not anymore
[1:25:13] <dredshift> Eagle claw it then coward
[1:25:17] <sileo_patronus> @AngriestPat I put dash on RB and weapon switch on Y
[1:25:21] <+zetaplus> fencer is the fastest class
[1:25:29] <%SergeantSov> Wait Fencer got nerfed in this one didn't it?
[1:25:30] <%Solidnick18> yep
[1:25:32] <lTaunto> gave wingdiver fencers old cancel dash
[1:25:36] <tank7013> @AngriestPat Set jump/roll to A and dash to trigger?
[1:25:38] <%connos_procrastination> im in bad luck all the time
[1:25:39] <tetriata> @ProvingVirus Fencer once he gets his upgrades isn't that much faster than Wing Diver with her own upgrades
[1:25:40] <Dragovus> Good translations were removed to allow more bugs on screen at a time
[1:25:41] <DSD24> Wait you are a civie in this?
[1:25:49] <RazielTheDark> Fencer doesn't have the speed glitch anymore
[1:25:50] <+punit216> individual control scheme
[1:25:53] <%happyface699> I AM THE GAME
[1:25:55] <%ArcanumMBD> @DSD24 you start as one. You join up after a few missions
[1:25:56] <sileo_patronus> @AngriestPat classes have different switch buttons anyway
[1:25:58] <TURBOSUPLEX3000> all classes have different controls
[1:25:59] <lTaunto> Wing Diver can go FAST now
[1:26:01] <snake_zen> those controles are only for ranger
[1:26:01] <RazielTheDark> But with Fencer you can have more than one dash
[1:26:01] <Axle13j> we're probably in bad luck
[1:26:04] <Cranky_Construct> Looks like your a security officer who gets dragged into it, so you're technically a civvie yeah
[1:26:04] <DSD24> @ArcanumMBD Ok that's cool
[1:26:04] <%Cthulos> in 5 until you get out of the tutorial
[1:26:05] <%foreverN2dust> @RazielTheDark this, you can't cancel dash
[1:26:06] <haitakaa> nice azz
[1:26:07] <%SirGO0SE> btw these games are fucking hard
[1:26:08] <%ProvingVirus> @sergeantsov if fencer got nerfed from 4.1 he got MASSIVE buffs to his mobility
[1:26:10] <Renkage> @SergeantSov No Fencer did not. In fact, once you get a few upgrades to your movement, it's better then he has ever been
[1:26:15] <%SergeantSov> Yeah Fencer isn't capable of FTL travel anymore, but Wing Divers are fast as hell
[1:26:29] <+SggtMarshie> God, he sounds like an npc
[1:26:32] <RazielTheDark> Yeah they gave Fencers dash and jump upgrades
[1:26:35] <$joylent_blue> "Stay close if you wanna live" *sprints ahead immediately*
[1:26:38] <%Afterman_> Did this just start?
[1:26:40] <+Grayhammatter> use the boost to get through
[1:26:41] <RazielTheDark> Waaaay better in my opinion
[1:26:42] <lloyddboy> ASS SHOT
[1:26:43] <%Afterman_> I just woke up from a sickness nap
[1:26:44] <sileo_patronus> >checks 3 of 4
[1:26:47] <StripesUltimateEdition> [zooms in on the ass]
[1:26:49] <%CommanderSqueaks> Hey look, it's the @SweetCheeksTrap camera.
[1:26:49] <jogaflame> Kreygasm
[1:26:50] <+VietcongSamurai> Fencer actually moves a lot faster now in 5 than 4.1 with the right upgrades.
[1:26:56] <$Big_King_Coconut> shoot these men
[1:26:56] <%ProvingVirus> I honestly think Fencers are faster than they were in 4.1
[1:26:57] <%SergeantSov> @Renkage Right right, I'm wing diver trash so I forget about other classes
[1:26:58] <Ninja_Kareca> @angriestpat how do you like dodging with L2? LUL
[1:26:58] <DSD24> I hope you get a cool Callsign like in the original EDF
[1:26:59] <%ArcanumMBD> Air Raider is best class. Big dick damage. Except for missions that block your call ins, or cave missions, then Air Raider sucks :(
[1:27:00] <%ShichiNoBushi> Does that make this a... food fight?
[1:27:00] <$joylent_blue> LUL
[1:27:00] <$BoSteed> I love all these same voices talking to each other. LuL
[1:27:01] <$starotter70> THANKS

[1:27:04] <+zetaplus> an he was in 4.1 in end game
[1:27:14] <%Diabetic> so what fits better Cruel Angel Thesis or Attack on Titan Intro 1?
[1:27:17] <%CommanderSqueaks> That's a HUGE fucking dodge.
[1:27:17] <%happyface699> Nice
[1:27:20] <$joylent_blue> JESUS that roll is insane
[1:27:20] <SulfurousAcid> shoot your friends
[1:27:24] <%SirGO0SE> woolieGASM
[1:27:26] <%Afterman_> I remember the time my cousin and I stayed up until 6 am to beat EDF 2017
[1:27:27] <+Grayhammatter> monsters!
[1:27:28] <+AmaniIsYourBoss> Kill the things!
[1:27:31] <haitakaa> that's not a monster that's just an ant

[1:27:41] <%logoth_> If you get biten you will DIE
[1:27:41] <+Xelig> @AngriestPat I need to move my desk (which would require me to temporarily unplug my modem and router), but I don't wanna stop watching your stream to do so...
[1:27:41] <$Big_King_Coconut> If you get bit you will DIE
[1:27:42] <+HypotheticalWalrus> YOU WILL DIE
[1:27:43] <+VietcongSamurai> Die?! d;
[1:27:43] <Renkage> You just gotta do Switch Canceling which will allow you to both Boost and Dash at the same time, making you zoom at insane speeds
[1:27:43] <%CommanderSqueaks> apatCrazyhand apatCrazyhand
[1:27:44] <DSD24> Shoot her!
[1:27:45] <%ShichiNoBushi> Ants have mandibles, not fangs.
[1:27:47] <Bamcc2> scjNom scjNom scjNom scjNom
[1:27:49] <%augusm> I've only played 4, is there an overarching plot that runs between the games or is it just an excuse to shoot buggos
[1:27:53] <jogaflame> PogChamp
[1:27:53] <moosemonkey397> the ragdolling is glorious
[1:27:54] <%Rain_Mage> People die when they are killed

[1:28:02] <+AmaniIsYourBoss> I feel like this series, Ace Combat, and Metal Wolf all share a universe.
[1:28:03] <leroyslammin> The ants have Fangdibles.
[1:28:04] <%Diabetic> I HATE their movement

[1:28:19] <%foreverN2dust> @Diabetic you have seen nothing
[1:28:19] <%Rain_Mage> WERE SAVED
[1:28:21] <%logoth_> lets escape from underground
[1:28:22] <$Big_King_Coconut> Let's ESCAPE from underGROUND
[1:28:22] <MultipleJiggs> I'm so sold on this game
[1:28:24] <SulfurousAcid> if you see green box always go for it @angriestpat
[1:28:26] <+Spec7re> Man id love a trashy edf movie
[1:28:28] <Minorou> Surely we'll be safe on the surface!
[1:28:30] <%Diabetic> I feel the stress sweats coming on
[1:28:32] <+zetaplus> @augusm it had overarching stories but 5 is set in a different universe
[1:28:32] <moosemonkey397> i am very concerned that the fastest way to move might be siderolling
[1:28:33] <Axle13j> rotation lerp
[1:28:34] <%Cthulos> augusm there are aliens but they're just excuses to have you fight giant bugs
[1:28:40] <lloyddboy> HAAAAGH
[1:28:40] <Daxalog> Vibrates?
[1:28:46] <RazielTheDark> @Spec7re there is, it's called Starship Troopers XD
[1:28:47] <Solokaldaka> nakkid1Lurk
[1:28:51] <%templar010> EDF EDF
[1:28:51] <%TheMattman1313> At this point these line deliveries HAVE to be deliberate.
[1:28:53] <Ninja_Kareca> can't you turn vibration off?
[1:28:54] <GeltonZ> @moosemonkey397 That's the way it used to be XD
[1:28:55] <DracaenaLeaf> American's funniest videos?
[1:28:57] <lloyddboy> THAT RADAR
[1:28:59] <%ProvingVirus> @augusm I think the only games that have a connected storyline are 2017 and 4.1, but 5 is a seperate timeline for some reason
[1:28:59] <Solokaldaka> nakkid1REE EDF!
[1:28:59] <leroyslammin> These guys survived a lot longer than I expected from an EDF game.
[1:29:00] <%Diabetic> Beware the slope lol
[1:29:03] <%Afterman_> THAT FUCKING SLOpe
[1:29:03] <+Grayhammatter> beware of the slope!
[1:29:04] <%CommanderSqueaks> What the fuck that's a slope
[1:29:09] <moosemonkey397> XD good to know
[1:29:11] <3xgilly> I like how the rocket launcher has bullets
[1:29:12] <DSD24> Man this base was made for Armored Cores
[1:29:13] <%AmaniIsYourBoss> AmaniIsYourBoss subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 7 months, currently on a 1 month streak! "It's a weapon! It's REALLY powerful, especially against living things!"
[1:29:13] <%SirGO0SE> lmao that fucking kick jump
[1:29:14] <%CommanderSqueaks> You cannot walk up that.
[1:29:15] <Ninja_Kareca> wait, wtf?
[1:29:16] <SulfurousAcid> EDF is a way of life
[1:29:17] <+buttdirt> goddamn, these guys are in shape
[1:29:18] <$BoSteed> I would love to be a fly on the wall during the voice recording for these games.
[1:29:21] <$Big_King_Coconut> a slope killed my father
[1:29:21] <%AncelDeLambert> how the fuck is anything supposed to drive up that ramp?
[1:29:23] <%Yadogari> What the fuck is the grade on that slope
[1:29:24] <+Grayhammatter> nice shot
[1:29:25] <SubjectX07x> @DracaenaLeaf Armored Fighting Vehicles, though that's a hell of a flat slope for an AFV.
[1:29:25] <%SergeantSov> To Bits you say?
[1:29:27] <+Madatom> exoskeloteen
[1:29:28] <%SirGO0SE> EDFS HERE BITCH
[1:29:30] <%ArcanumMBD> @moosemonkey397 on Ranger, sprinting is the same as rolling, and faster with certain upgrades. On Air Raider rolling is faster. Fencer and Wing Diver have their own movement stuff
[1:29:37] <%Afterman_> pats smearing shit on the walls again
[1:29:39] <SubjectX07x> Or any V lol.
[1:29:39] <+TheBitingIrish> DIE, YOU MONSTER
[1:29:40] <InugamiTheHound> this better version of Bug Island!
[1:29:40] <%Diabetic> how is running ahead going for back up...?
[1:29:42] <%MyDarkStorm> Nuke Those Bug
[1:29:44] <$joylent_blue> this looks weirdly satisfying
[1:29:58] <Strider222> ASS ZOOM
[1:30:00] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Afterman_ You know he does that when he gets too worked up.
[1:30:01] <%SirGO0SE> YEAH shoot him into the ceiling!
[1:30:02] <%SergeantSov> It is more satisfying than a significant amount of games out today
[1:30:04] <%ProvingVirus> like I've said before, this is the best EDF by far
[1:30:06] <lloyddboy> ASS
[1:30:07] <DSD24> All they have to do is make the shooting better each game and add more bugs
[1:30:09] <%DePhat1> gibbing galore here in EDF
[1:30:10] <+Grayhammatter> well done!
[1:30:12] <jogaflame> ASS
[1:30:13] <%Rain_Mage> WELL DONE
[1:30:15] <runsoverfrogs> He only hates edf1 because it‚Äôs part of the channel he destroyed!!! üòÆ
[1:30:15] <+brave_sj> So if the bugs are new to this game's EDF what were they formed to fight?
[1:30:16] <%TheSavageGrunts> wad up man

[1:30:24] <Bamcc2> Patt did you play EDF Iron Rain?
[1:30:27] <$Big_King_Coconut> how the hell are you supposed to see where you're going with that camera?
[1:30:28] <sileo_patronus> @AngriestPat tip for ranger: you can come out of a sprint faster by rolling to avoid the slide
[1:30:29] <Solokaldaka> nakkid1Hm this is a butt stream now
[1:30:31] <%logoth_> Powah'd exoskeletahn
[1:30:35] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Big_King_Coconut It focuses on what's important.
[1:30:38] <3xgilly> are these games ok on mouse and keyboard?
[1:30:38] <+Madatom> EXOSKLOTEEN
[1:30:42] <DSD24> Robot like things!?

[1:30:49] <%miguelrod777> AAAAA
[1:30:50] <%Cthulos> this game is edf4.1+, edf Iron Rain should be the true sequel
[1:30:53] <$joylent_blue> we care about licenses in this situation?

[1:30:58] <+TheBitingIrish> @Bamcc2 Saw Driken play some, looked kinda like the MHW of EDF
[1:30:59] <Shrcker> If only we knew what they were
[1:30:59] <NobuuNobuu> @AngriestPat How is your progress in judgment?
[1:31:02] <+Madatom> why did the ants know to blow up the robits
[1:31:03] <%Laecerelius> Go jobber squad!!!
[1:31:03] <%CommanderSqueaks> @RazielTheDark You know exactly why, some artist spent HOURS shaping that ass and you're going to appreciate it, dammit.
[1:31:03] <+TechnicolorNinja> Who left the sugar out?
[1:31:04] <danknugglit> EDF!!!
[1:31:04] <%MyDarkStorm> Theyre Coming OUT OF THE GODDAMN WALLS
[1:31:06] <+TheBitingIrish> @Bamcc2 Criken*

[1:31:29] <KaseKaizer> FeelsBadMan
[1:31:31] <+kuervojones> This game or Monster Hunter World?
[1:31:32] <+Madatom> speaking of ffxiv, whad do you think of the new raid
[1:31:32] <%Afterman_> I already did
[1:31:34] <%ProvingVirus> @ninja_kareca they did, unfortunately
[1:31:36] <RazielTheDark> @Ninja_Kareca Funny you should say that . . .
[1:31:36] <%Solidnick18> i'm done
[1:31:37] <tetriata> @Ninja_Kareca Oh they're back. In force.
[1:31:37] <SubjectX07x> YER GOOD
[1:31:39] <$starotter70> This franchise is like the B-Movie gold of the Video Game industry
[1:31:39] <$BoSteed> Don't tell me to do what I did already. DansGame
[1:31:40] <Renkage> @Ninja_Kareca I have some poor news
[1:31:42] <Axle13j> @ninja_kareca Kappa
[1:31:42] <Jeemukun> I would but i ain't got a ps4
[1:31:42] <%connos_procrastination> no shit

[1:31:43] <DSD24> Man the gibs on display
[1:31:45] <$Big_King_Coconut> we're SCREWED
[1:31:47] <SulfurousAcid> you know, I've never actually seen my armor go down in this game
[1:31:48] <moosemonkey397> i wish i wasnt so broke so i could play 14.
[1:31:48] <LiquidMathew> just finished Judgment the other day, its pretty great
[1:31:49] <+Alasdair89> I'm holding out for the PC port
[1:31:51] <%Solidnick18> iron rain is pretty good
[1:31:58] <DSD24> Iron Rain has some cool shit
[1:31:59] <Ninja_Kareca> oh god... BibleThump
[1:32:03] <RazielTheDark> I like the classes in Iron Rain
[1:32:06] <%Afterman_> @LiquidMathew Im in ch 7, does it continue to get better?
[1:32:06] <%Black_Machete> run pat
[1:32:06] <Strider222> huh!
[1:32:13] <RazielTheDark> Specially the AoT class XD
[1:32:13] <$BoSteed> OCD! OCD!
[1:32:14] <+Madatom> roll pat
[1:32:16] <+NickyDynamite> Is judegement fun if I was getting tired of Kamurocho after Kiwami?
[1:32:19] <InugamiTheHound> Lawrence from FunHaus loves EDF games
[1:32:20] <Daxalog> Are you going to play this online?
[1:32:21] <DSD24> The character customization in Iron Rain is really good
[1:32:22] <%Afterman_> @LiquidMathew obvs enjoying it already just wanna make sure the quality doesnt drop
[1:32:23] <+Grayhammatter> many monstars
[1:32:23] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> @TheBitingIrish More like the Oblivion if 4.1 was morrowind. They're both great, but the one that is more playable has much worse dialog and writing
[1:32:24] <%ProvingVirus> Iron Rain is aight, it's not as janky as the main series which somehow makes it less enjoyable
[1:32:24] <$joylent_blue> holy SHIT
[1:32:25] <sileo_patronus> 4.1 didn't have objective arrows right?
[1:32:26] <Bamcc2> kbradSTARS
[1:32:26] <%ArcanumMBD> More than 1 monster
[1:32:32] <haitakaa> hunt the monsters Pat
[1:32:36] <%VanaSkiller> apatBig many Mon Stars
[1:32:37] <%Diabetic> It's like doo doo on the walls
[1:32:40] <LiquidMathew> @Afterman_ there was many times when i went "oh man it'd be great if they did X" then they immediately did X
[1:32:40] <%Rngiddion> monstars? is barkley gonna chaos dunk on them?
[1:32:42] <+TheBitingIrish> @SulfurousAcid That's the max, it's HP
[1:32:44] <%SirGO0SE> rockets always rule in these
[1:32:45] <Bamcc2> kbradSTARS kbradSTARS kbradSTARS kbradSTARS
[1:32:49] <RazielTheDark> I think Iron Rain is more tame than the originals, which makes it that little bit less enjoyable
[1:32:50] <+Grayhammatter> wow, the framerate isn't even jittering all that much
[1:32:51] <Ion_Laser> The only Good Bug is a Dead Bug!
[1:32:52] <%templar010> Who needs an exoskeleton
[1:32:55] <%templar010> Apply ROCKET
[1:32:58] <RazielTheDark> I wanna call down massive space missles!
[1:33:00] <%ArcanumMBD> 4.1 on PC had a good framerate
[1:33:00] <+TheBitingIrish> @AngriestPat Don't worry, there's still time
[1:33:02] <jogaflame> gross
[1:33:02] <shotgunspaghetti> @AngriestPat are you gonna play metal wolf chaos XD on stream?
[1:33:02] <+Madatom> ASS

[1:33:11] <leroyslammin> Apply rocket to carapace.
[1:33:12] <%AncelDeLambert> zoo?
[1:33:13] <%SergeantSov> a ZOO????
[1:33:13] <$Big_King_Coconut> the giant ant zoo
[1:33:17] <+Madatom> reall talk why does at do that
[1:33:18] <%Solidnick18> LUL
[1:33:19] <Strider222> if only we had powered exoskeletons
[1:33:19] <leroyslammin> m o n s t e r s
[1:33:20] <$joylent_blue> a fucking zoo
[1:33:20] <+Shaggnar> If the frame rate is good clearly you need more ants
[1:33:22] <+brave_sj> D: language
[1:33:24] <sileo_patronus> @gespenst25 gotta be visible
[1:33:24] <+lucaflow> I wish I could play EDF but the bug designs just creep me out too much

[1:36:00] <Saltmeisterr> SHLOOT
[1:36:00] <$BoSteed> This is like the opposite of "Thanks, I hate it." It's like "This sucks, I love it."
[1:36:00] <%ArcanumMBD> EDF was the firsdt SHLOOTER
[1:36:01] <digaogrunge> BIG GRIND
[1:36:01] <RagingLeo> oh neat A SHLOOTER
[1:36:01] <tetriata> @EBT93 They make a couple comments about bugs during the game so that can't be the case

[1:36:10] <%Solidnick18> this has a bijillion missions
[1:36:10] <+brave_sj> Does that mean Pat invented EDF
[1:36:10] <TheAimless> yes, and in EDF 5 every weapon can upgrade every stat of them

[1:36:27] <+HypotheticalWalrus> the weapons are crazy as well
[1:36:29] <%alcors_wisdom> you need to play maps on hard to get high tier weapons
[1:36:30] <+kuervojones> @EBT93 All creatures on earth are primitive aliens, except for humans, that were placed to see which one gained supremacy as an intergalatic battle royale
[1:36:30] <leroyslammin> Schlooter is the worst word ever invented
[1:36:33] <%Agami23> that explains why my brother loves this game
[1:36:33] <+Spec7re> Its a muso game combined with a shlooter game

[1:36:43] <MasterDecoder> The trashiest of the Shlooters? Should Paige play it?
[1:36:46] <aimlesshealer> They sound like joke voices done by the Brothers Chaps
[1:36:48] <%Gray_skies1993> MOR monSTARS?
[1:36:48] <gwenhale> I thought Pat did not like edf, could have sword I heard he said that once
[1:36:49] <%Afterman_> doesnt that make dynasty warriors a flooter
[1:36:50] <%Skrypto> this is a long sloping hallway
[1:36:50] <%Black_Machete> you can upgrade weapons through loot drops
[1:36:51] <%happyface699> EDF IS BEST GIRL

[1:59:54] <kingdudeby> So its an unidentified flying object dropping off the pylons.

[2:00:30] <TheyCallMeVawn> This game is THE BEST
[2:00:32] <+enterprise900> EDF is still better at making something feel truly epic than most AAA games
[2:00:32] <+Spec7re> @Tennochief This wouldnt be a problem if it were the tau
[2:00:33] <%Rain_Mage> Yup it's as large as the sea

[2:00:52] <Renkage> Oh pat doesn't know about Air Dash
[2:00:53] <%SergeantSov> That's an insect.
[2:00:54] <KaseKaizer> weather baloon
[2:00:55] <+kastev> @AngriestPat the air dash move also slightly extends your pickup range
[2:00:55] <%AmaniIsYourBoss> Oh shit...Oh no, I think I was wrong about EDF. I have to get this.
[2:00:56] <%Solidnick18> then what are they
[2:00:57] <Tennochief> @Spec7re I'd love to see the Tau try and negotiate with bugs and get eaten
[2:00:57] <%mostundesired> A little fucking late for denial.

[2:01:37] <+punit216> bless you
[2:01:38] <MoulesFritz> there have been like 20 years a\of giant ants
[2:01:39] <%SergeantSov> Everyone but Fencer
[2:01:39] <leroyslammin> @MoulesFritz Alternate timeline, first attack.
[2:01:40] <%ProvingVirus> fuckin wreck that entire parking lot to kill 1 ant
[2:01:40] <krymzen5> can't wait for the giant frogs
[2:01:42] <GeltonZ> @MoulesFritz EDF reboots every two games, that's how
[2:01:44] <+TheBitingIrish> @MoulesFritz Prequel
[2:01:47] <%VantomPayne> BlessRNG
[2:01:49] <+zetaplus> @MoulesFritz they reset every two games
[2:01:53] <+TheBitingIrish> or reboot I guess
[2:01:54] <+RealPT1> the wide rapier guns are good for tunnel maps
[2:01:55] <%Rain_Mage> The real treasure were the monsters we made along the way
[2:01:57] <%TeddyRose_> apatCrazyhead apatPorgmo apatCanada apatCrazyhand apatWhat apatWink

[2:02:13] <Flickerember> She sounds like link a lil bit. smol link
[2:02:13] <leroyslammin> Y would you do that
[2:02:14] <Ninja_Kareca> M
[2:02:14] <BMPixy> So we're not at "To save our mother Earth from any alien attack!" yet?
[2:02:20] <+enterprise900> You switch weapon sets as Fencer
[2:02:21] <ScarletPrime> Because Fencers have 4 weapons and dual wield.
[2:02:25] <robbierottensrottenrectum> you can use the nintendo switch as a weapon?
[2:02:27] <+kastev> yeah I like Y for weapon switch
[2:02:32] <sileo_patronus> Perfect logic
[2:02:34] <TURBOSUPLEX3000> that song isn't in 5 @BMPixy
[2:02:35] <alrobot2014> isn't that what was suggested earlier?
[2:02:37] <NoirePanzer> BOOSTO
[2:02:39] <leroyslammin> @BMPixy That was 4.1 so it's an entirely different timeline.
[2:02:42] <%jiin6> Y to switch to Elmo
[2:02:42] <krymzen5> good idea
[2:02:45] <%ProvingVirus> congrats, you fixed Wing Diver's controls
[2:02:52] <%foreverN2dust> the boost is godly
[2:02:56] <Nekros4442> oof

[2:03:00] <Ninja_Kareca> LUL
[2:03:06] <%UncleAWOL> The boost is the best
[2:03:08] <+kastev> Air dashing backwards is super cool
[2:03:09] <robbierottensrottenrectum> is pat on pc or playstation?
[2:03:10] <+enterprise900> That is some Jehuty tier shit

[2:03:29] <sileo_patronus> Cleanup time
[2:03:37] <%SergeantSov> Time to clean up
[2:03:38] <InugamiTheHound> this is same trick for COD zombies as well.
[2:03:38] <+Grayhammatter> OH NO
[2:03:42] <%flagi64> flagi64 subscribed at Tier 2. They've subscribed for 12 months, currently on a 12 month streak! 1 year is super weird, thanks for the streams and the overall craziness

[2:04:27] <bear_breaker20> Aleins ARE NOT Terrorist*
[2:04:31] <+Madatom> GI JOE
[2:04:33] <+kastev> EDF HAS to be played with a controller
[2:04:34] <%wolfofsound> get the fuck out of here you stupid idiots
[2:04:34] <kingdudeby> time for a body massage.
[2:04:37] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@Kain5707) (warning)
[2:04:37] <+kastev> It just doesn't play well otherwise
[2:04:38] <DSD24> Wing Diver looks cool
[2:04:39] <leroyslammin> Porkchop? When did Hot Wheels become canon to EDF?
[2:04:39] <vulkans2> my god did that smell good
[2:04:41] <robbierottensrottenrectum> @millionstabz D:
[2:04:41] <Levant_Ex> give em the stick!
[2:04:42] <SulfurousAcid> we wing diver now?
[2:04:46] <kingdudeby> I'm a computer stop all the downloading!
[2:04:47] <%PanicSwytch> the ants are committing acts of terrorism
[2:04:48] <NoirePanzer> Aliens are (not) terrorists
[2:05:00] <%wolfofsound> body massage machine GO
[2:05:01] <%SergeantSov> Air Raider is just worse ranger solo
[2:05:01] <Tennochief> ever see the Dark Eldar?
[2:05:02] <+Spec7re> Give him the stick NO DONT GIVE HIM THE STICK
[2:05:05] <%SirGO0SE> PrideWingL MercyWing2
[2:05:13] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Spec7re "Ooooooooooo"
[2:05:17] <%wolfofsound> Tell me does your mom still hang out at dock side bars?
[2:05:17] <tetriata> Oh man, pat is not gonna have a good time if he plays Air Raider on this level
[2:05:18] <Tennochief> Absolutely Space Terrorist rapist pirate
[2:05:18] <+Madatom> OoOoOoOoOoOoO
[2:05:20] <Kain5707> @AngriestPat have you run Eden yet?
[2:05:20] <leroyslammin> Air Raider has air strikes. No competition.
[2:05:24] <%ProvingVirus> Air Raider might be a poor choice for this coming mission
[2:05:25] <+Spec7re> GI Jooooooooooooe
[2:05:28] <TURBOSUPLEX3000> enter vehicle/revive dead player
[2:05:29] <%foreverN2dust> air raider Kreygasm
[2:05:32] <sileo_patronus> Get in vehicle or rescue team
[2:05:38] <krymzen5> air raider is the support if i remember
[2:05:46] <%SergeantSov> Air Raider is not a good choice for this coming mission.
[2:05:46] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> he has mechs
[2:05:47] <%Bearphonics> It's getting into vehicles and the revive button in multiplayer
[2:05:48] <dynam0jones> Fencer dual miniguns for life
[2:05:55] <+RealPT1> air raider can summon mech suits eventually
[2:05:55] <leroyslammin> He also gets big mecharoonies
[2:05:58] <sileo_patronus> He gets all the cool vehicles, he doesn't deserve a run
[2:06:03] <Tennochief> Limbet Bizket
[2:06:04] <haitakaa> Sticky bunnz
[2:06:11] <%jiin6> Sticky
[2:06:13] <%connos_procrastination> ROOMBA bomb
[2:06:17] <%SergeantSov> He needs teammates to be good on his own at first at least
[2:06:17] <+RealPT1> air raider is hard to grind with solo though
[2:06:24] <+Grayhammatter> you can get a vehicle
[2:06:25] <haitakaa> roombamb
[2:06:26] <leroyslammin> Surprisingly allies are actually useful in this game.
[2:06:28] <%foreverN2dust> The APC is pretty good
[2:06:29] <InugamiTheHound> yeah support guys aren't good for a solo mission
[2:06:30] <TURBOSUPLEX3000> you will never use any of the support weapons once you get a few air raider weapons
[2:06:30] <bear_breaker20> vehicles?! PogChamp
[2:06:31] <+Estuko> Sheer Heart ATtack ?
[2:06:34] <robbierottensrottenrectum> @AngriestPat air raider is the best class long term
[2:06:38] <+kastev> Air Raider isn't too great solo
[2:06:39] <StrayShep> wow they took away the air raiders badass armor
[2:06:39] <%ArcanumMBD> Air Raider isn't support, they are BIG DAMAGE. Using support stuff is for cowards
[2:06:40] <%foreverN2dust> You can put the sentries on top of your vehicles
[2:06:45] <%Agami23> is the ZE-gun french?
[2:06:46] <vulkans2> the limpet guns are so bad
[2:06:50] <%ProvingVirus> Air Raider is pretty weak early game tbh
[2:06:52] <snake_zen> go to the left on weapon screen
[2:06:55] <Ninja_Kareca> Air Raider has no weaknesses!!!
[2:07:00] <krymzen5> wing diver 4 life
[2:07:06] <$Tuskor13> I wasn't looking at the screen and I thought he read the name of a gun called the "Life Ender" and I was legit excited cuz that's the best stupid gun name
[2:07:08] <%VantomPayne> @AngriestPat you support until you nukes the map, summons a gundam then murders everyone and your team member
[2:07:09] <sileo_patronus> I dunno, Fencer is pretty busted in 5
[2:07:12] <+Spec7re> Fencer you got two miniguns
[2:07:14] <TURBOSUPLEX3000> @StrayShep this is before you're enlisted in the EDF so this air raider is just a mechanic who grabbed a walkie talkie
[2:07:15] <InugamiTheHound> BRB
[2:07:16] <%SergeantSov> Swiftly realizing he was gonna make a mistake
[2:07:20] <+VietcongSamurai> sourpls
[2:07:20] <CaptainFrankincense> air raider is really good solo now
[2:07:20] <%UncleAWOL> I usually end up soloing with wing diver just to make it easier to pick up the boxes
[2:07:21] <TURBOSUPLEX3000> it comes later
[2:07:27] <+PlushMines> Air raider is so preposterously strong in 5
[2:07:33] <Unicorngundam24> Pat, know any good PS2/X games other than Punisher or Metal Gear?

[2:17:54] <ExpressNode> With guns like these the aliens were clearly unprepared
[2:17:56] <greyknight1575> the whole point of edf is that it looks like garbage

[2:18:12] <CaptainFrankincense> yeh good luck running this in 4k
[2:18:13] <%Afterman_> if the game looked like fuckin rdr2 this wouldnt be able to work
[2:18:14] <+risenlp2> just amazes me how much a single soldier can take out with a machine gun in this. I mean is alien tech just focused on quanity of quality?

[2:22:10] <Oracle324> kurobaEe kurobaDd kurobaFf
[2:22:16] <greyknight1575> upgrades
[2:22:16] <DSD24> What about the Fencers
[2:22:18] <+A_mere_shrubb> Each star is an upgrade level
[2:22:18] <%Gray_skies1993> seems like it kept you alive that mission
[2:22:25] <+PikkoPikko> stars are upgrades to the weapon
[2:22:26] <Jack_of_No_Trades> oooo I like the EDF emote
[2:22:28] <%furiousfurioso> filled in star means that stat is maxed
[2:22:29] <sileo_patronus> @AngriestPat stars are the level of that stat, white star means max level
[2:22:32] <Renkage> @AngriestPat That tells you how upgraded it is. If the star is filled in, it's maxed out
[2:22:32] <greyknight1575> if you collect the same weapon a second time it gets upgraded
[2:22:33] <+oOZtkOo> star s are upgrades, if the star is filled in that means that stat is maxed
[2:22:34] <TheAimless> @AngriestPat the higher the number next to a star the better, if the star is white, the stat is maxed
[2:22:35] <taptapmuhgap> It's really effective against living things.
[2:22:38] <+d00msdaydan> @AngriestPat stars represent upgrade level, colored in star means max level
[2:22:39] <Patzzki217> if a star is solid its fully upgraded in that stat
[2:22:40] <suikudo> Fans of Kirby are here
[2:22:42] <%YourFavoriteShiba> Pat becomes the new Sky Marshal
[2:22:42] <%Laecerelius> Minion buster seems really strong
[2:22:45] <+PikkoPikko> various aspects of each gun can be upgraded, like reload time, damage, bullet speed, etc
[2:22:48] <%SirGO0SE> wooliePOYO
[2:22:50] <+BrainslyBrawnigan> every time a weapon is upgraded a stats star level will go up
[2:22:51] <%ProvingVirus> stars are an indication of how much a stat has been upgraded, a filled in star means it's maxed out
[2:22:55] <disflipmat> Big stars make the number go big up
[2:22:57] <%Black_Machete> sniper needed
[2:22:57] <@SSaryn> I am here to laugh at funny man and funny EDF man
[2:22:58] <sileo_patronus> YEAH
[2:22:59] <DSD24> Yes
[2:22:59] <Jack_of_No_Trades> lets see plague
[2:22:59] <suikudo> none of you fuckers have started spamming FEEF yet whats the deal?
[2:23:01] <ThorW> Fencer BEST CLASS

[2:23:12] <%Halowood> RIP Dash Cancelling
[2:23:13] <Tucker0603> FENCER IS MY BOY
[2:23:13] <%Gray_skies1993> massive Gundam Heavyarms vibes
[2:23:15] <Jack_of_No_Trades> cause Plague build fence
[2:23:16] <Tennochief> NICE
[2:23:17] <Botman_R> Why does the Fencer look lame now?
[2:23:17] <NeroInfinite> Yeah show us the construction man.
[2:23:18] <L0rd_TriHard> I love how this is a 2019 game and it looks like a ps2 game LUL
[2:23:20] <+Skwizgarr> Dispenser goin up tobiasHARD
[2:23:21] <Strider222> why would a civilian use this lol
[2:23:22] <ThorW> Fencers are always teh best class, I love them
[2:23:23] <+RowenCleric> throw a hard hat and safety vest n him he will be fine in the SPACE WAR
[2:23:23] <disflipmat> Pat, put a gun in one hand and a melee weapon in the other
[2:23:25] <Ninja_Kareca> can you still dash cancel or did they patch it?
[2:23:25] <%foreverN2dust> The plague of gripes
[2:23:31] <%ProvingVirus> RIP Dash cancelling, long live Dash jumping
[2:23:36] <disflipmat> and alternate dash and jump for max speed
[2:23:37] <GeltonZ> @Botman_R This is the Civilian Version. You get new outfits once you join the EDF in Mission 13
[2:23:38] <%foreverN2dust> the ants will know the girth of his fence
[2:23:39] <ThorW> You can dash jump now
[2:23:40] <+A0N33> They made dash cancelling easier, from what I've hear
[2:23:43] <Tennochief> Make him a Tech Priest
[2:23:43] <Renkage> @Botman_R This is civilian Fencer. You get soldier Fencer later
[2:23:46] <+sixcubit> ah yes, the b-hole spear
[2:23:46] <%SirGO0SE> it totally is the plague of gripes w0w
[2:23:48] <FuqBoiSlim> Fenceman pknFGM
[2:23:49] <SilentStarPlatinum> I love EDF!
[2:23:51] <+BrainslyBrawnigan> Make sure you have a dash and a vertical boost in the right and left hand respectively and you become the most menuverable character in the game
[2:23:53] <+Spec7re> All i heard was PILEDRVIER
[2:23:54] <roguestormtrooper> What?
[2:23:55] <Tucker0603> PILE FUCKING BUNKER
[2:23:56] <%CommanderSqueaks> Imagine how high Plague could build his fence if he had a powerex exoskeleton?
[2:23:56] <haveswordmuststing> WE nEEd a dIsPenser HeRe
[2:23:57] <TheDr0t> @angriestpat upgraded fenser can use dmc4 guard flying
[2:24:04] <ThorW> Fencers put wing divers to shame with their mobility
[2:24:06] <@SSaryn> Spear is good enough at short ranges to hold 2 for sure.
[2:24:07] <Tennochief> that's rad
[2:24:15] <taptapmuhgap> well
[2:24:17] <Justin_Wood> _That guy looked way cooler_
[2:24:20] <$BoSteed> Lol, that texture pop in
[2:24:21] <+BrainslyBrawnigan> dash boost spam makes the fencer super fast
[2:24:26] <Ninja_Kareca> To save our Mother Earth from any alien attack!
[2:24:32] <%GeneralSCPatton> @commandersqueaks Plague would build his fence into the damn Margarita system.
[2:24:37] <%Afterman_> I SWEAR that said butthole spear
[2:24:39] <+PikkoPikko> this is gonna be a hard mission for fencer iirc
[2:24:41] <DSD24> Pile Bunkers here we go
[2:24:43] <thelonechris> Good luck
[2:24:47] <lloyddboy> TELL ME HOW
[2:24:50] <Moonlight_Grimoire> Nice Pilebunker
[2:24:50] <%foreverN2dust> @ThorW I wouldn't say that about them in 5 since they nerf the dash cancel
[2:24:57] <Tucker0603> PILE BUNKER IS THE BEST
[2:24:57] <%Afterman_> tell me more
[2:24:57] <@SSaryn> Dont think spears is gonna be the best here though.
[2:24:59] <TURBOSUPLEX3000> 2nd swing of the spear deals more damage and has more range
[2:24:59] <+A_mere_shrubb> There is a move glitch to make fencer not shit
[2:25:04] <Renkage> @BrainslyBrawnigan Or you can have a Dash in one right had, while a boost in the 2nd right hand. Then switch cancel to do both.
[2:25:12] <%SirGO0SE> but...IM COLORBLIND
[2:25:13] <TURBOSUPLEX3000> shield bash reflect projectiles
[2:25:14] <sileo_patronus> Reflects projectiles
[2:25:15] <Botman_R> Shot deflect.
[2:25:15] <%ArcanumMBD> reflects projectiles
[2:25:15] <+oOZtkOo> a reflect for ranged attacks
[2:25:16] <+TardyClock> Wait, is this some kind of space war?
[2:25:17] <@SSaryn> It just deflects projectiles
[2:25:17] <+RealPT1> is dash shield cancel wave dashing still in?
[2:25:18] <haveswordmuststing> Stab the flying robots, Pat
[2:25:20] <+BrainslyBrawnigan> if you boost in the middle of a dash your momentum is conserved
[2:25:21] <+PikkoPikko> reflects projectiles
[2:25:27] <Videogamer4> PARRY PROJECTILES
[2:25:30] <+VERDAXY> noo we have CHARGE
[2:25:30] <+brave_sj> Nah kill em all
[2:25:30] <Prism_Wing> I never heard the word Pilebunker until Bloodborne.
[2:25:35] <Renkage> Actually teaching you about pulling mobs
[2:25:37] <absolute_cagemony> Paaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat
[2:25:37] <suikudo> Fencer is god awful for flying shit
[2:25:38] <GeltonZ> OH! Start dancing!
[2:25:38] <+Spec7re> Dolphin team
[2:25:42] <%SirGO0SE> haha i bet the rabbit team fucks
[2:25:49] <%furiousfurioso> dash and THEN jump, you'll go flying
[2:25:50] <GeltonZ> If you dance near other troops they'll dance too
[2:25:52] <%Afterman_> yeah this guy seems bad for drones
[2:25:53] <+BrainslyBrawnigan> not with dual Gatling guns
[2:25:55] <FRAUDULENTMONSTER> FISH TEAM
[2:25:55] <big_smokes_big_woke> Have you and Woolie ever considered playing a session of Dungeons and Dragons? Cheer1000 Cheer100 Cheer100 Cheer100 Cheer100 Cheer100
[2:26:00] <+TardyClock> Orange Means Go, Blue Means Stop
[2:26:07] <sileo_patronus> Fencer needs a proper setup more than any other class
[2:26:08] <+BrainslyBrawnigan> @furiousfurioso gets it
[2:26:09] <%SirGO0SE> PogChamp
[2:26:14] <+zetaplus> fencer aren't,, they fly really far and fast with the right set up
[2:26:18] <+Jesus_X_Boredom> Lancer was crap in the last game if you didn't learn to Dash Cancel. Is that the same here?
[2:26:19] <@SSaryn> EDF are ready and prepared to be shot at by their own men Kappa
[2:26:19] <%foreverN2dust> Raise your shield
[2:26:26] <TheAimless> activate CWIS
[2:26:30] <%ProvingVirus> @angriestpat your weapon setup isn't right for it, but you can cancel a ground dash into a dash jump to catapult yourself foward at a ludicrous speed
[2:26:31] <+Madatom> imma just shoot this boy with a .50 100 times in the back cuz hes in the way
[2:26:34] <Renkage> @AngriestPat Protip: Press RB and Y at the EXACT same time. Unless you changed the controls
[2:26:36] <Ninja_Kareca> EYE C
[2:26:40] <sileo_patronus> no
[2:26:46] <Tennochief> he changed the controls
[2:26:48] <+zetaplus> @Jesus_X_Boredom they're faster and stronger in this game with the right stuff
[2:26:52] <Rashnam> usually I double up on gatlings so I can reload one while firing with the other
[2:26:58] <borous> @Jesus_X_Boredom fencer has new boost and jumping class items so he can zip around super fast in 5
[2:27:00] <+OkamiDude15> to save our mother earth from any alien attack woopsAh
[2:27:06] <ThorW> @foreverN2dust Fencers can dash boost which while not as good as dash cancelling is still a ton of mobility that can spam pretty quick
[2:27:20] <+BrainslyBrawnigan> I'll usually have a blasthole and a light mortar or something so I can do the dash boost
[2:27:42] <%GeneralSCPatton> @brainslybrawnigan blasthole hellow2Manface
[2:27:53] <+zetaplus> there's a japanese video on youtube out there that shows how fast the fencer can be in edf5
[2:27:54] <ThorW> Gotta get in range first
[2:27:55] <+BrainslyBrawnigan> crikPls crikNo
[2:27:55] <NeroInfinite> If you could hit them
[2:27:55] <Tucker0603> Blasthole rules
[2:27:58] <+Skwizgarr> assuming you hit any Kappa
[2:27:59] <sileo_patronus> if you were in range sure
[2:28:02] <%foreverN2dust> @ThorW still not as mobile as wing divers in 5 Kappa
[2:28:10] <+Renkaru> the jetpack girl is a ton of fun
[2:28:18] <@SSaryn> pretty sure the red ones just deploy on their own but could be wrong
[2:28:20] <robbierottensrottenrectum> monkaS
[2:28:29] <ThorW> @foreverN2dust Look just because you're correct doesn't mean you're right
[2:28:36] <NeroInfinite> Nope Fencer kinda sucks for flying stuff.
[2:28:36] <+Spec7re> Nah its fine you just gotta be in range
[2:28:38] <+Grayhammatter> nah, it's fine
[2:28:44] <%Gogogolem> He's good for bosses
[2:28:44] <Renkage> I usually roll double Jackhammer and double Gatling Gun. Then just Switch Cancel to do the Dash Jumping
[2:28:54] <Proeaten> I ended up switching to wing diver here, made it way easier, but it is super doable with the other classes
[2:29:03] <sileo_patronus> @NeroInfinite I disagree, but yeah he doesn't have any sniping stuff yet
[2:29:27] <suikudo> Fencer is just way to slow
[2:29:39] <@SSaryn> Once you get cannon shot, you might like that more. Dual Gatling Gun and Dual Spears are good enough for mid range.
[2:29:41] <sileo_patronus> Tougher but super buff if you play good
[2:29:42] <a_a_ronin> Does this game have co-op?
[2:29:44] <TheAimless> I mean he doesnt have a bloodstorm, so ofc his setup isnt optimal :P
[2:29:49] <redlight55> no storm weapon yet FeelsBadMan
[2:29:50] <Renkage> @suikudo Oh god no..... Well depends on your build
[2:29:54] <@SSaryn> Any mortars are great for long range
[2:29:54] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat You look like a megaman boss
[2:29:56] <+VietcongSamurai> @a_a_ronin ye
[2:29:57] <sileo_patronus> @a_a_ronin 2-player couch, 4-player online
[2:29:59] <jeffishype> Blasthole Spear LUL LUL LUL
[2:30:00] <ThorW> Fencer's only slow if you don't use his skills or build mobility on him
[2:30:09] <a_a_ronin> I gotta get this
[2:30:23] <mankeyfigh> Hey chat, this game isn‚Äôt new right?
[2:30:25] <%SuichiTanaka> For fencer, you gotta cancel dashes into melee, into dashes
[2:30:31] <Dr_Mooose> yes
[2:30:33] <worldbrand> it sure does
[2:30:38] <robbierottensrottenrectum> their lit
[2:30:38] <Proeaten> It came out in late 2018 I think?

[2:34:42] <Strider222> last year
[2:34:42] <Ninja_Kareca> EDF
[2:34:43] <%SirGO0SE> they made this game on floor cream cheese they had to scrape off the ground
[2:34:43] <Louie_Salmon> E D F
[2:34:44] <@SSaryn> Oh no. Oh no. I remembered Anthem again.
[2:34:44] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat This game more fun than anthem because you actually get loot.
[2:34:44] <+OkamiDude15> if i was asked to do some dumb voices for edf id fucking do it
[2:34:45] <InugamiTheHound> have they fixed anthem?
[2:34:46] <EBT93> EDF
[2:34:46] <+VietcongSamurai> I'd do voice acting for this game for free.

[2:34:52] <jeffishype> they found the game on some dudes xbox live arcade\
[2:34:53] <%frankthetank285> yeah but ea is incompetent
[2:34:53] <%Afterman_> id do this va work for this game for a fuckin copy, or free
[2:34:53] <TURBOSUPLEX3000> @AngriestPat whether you dash or boost jump is based on your weapon. equipping a weapon that can dash and one that can boost allows you to carry the momentum of a dash into a boost jump for extremely high mobility
[2:34:55] <krymzen5> they made this game for the price of a combo meal at bk
[2:34:56] <%foreverN2dust> They recorded the auditions and used that.
[2:34:58] <thetyrantcbass> The EDF was a tax dodge
[2:35:02] <sileo_patronus> oh well
[2:35:03] <copyritetm> would you do voiceacting for a japanese game for free pat?
[2:35:03] <%hawk_rush> ah, 2017
[2:35:04] <%Kenori> EDF
[2:35:07] <Ninja_Kareca> why not try Raider?
[2:35:07] <+VietcongSamurai> Air raider~
[2:35:09] <Louie_Salmon> Y'know, I really did forget anthem, until you just said its name
[2:35:09] <Botman_R> Yeah, try 2 weapons instead of 1 and a shield next time.
[2:35:09] <tetriata> @AngriestPat MNormal difficulty gives bad loot drops
[2:35:10] <%Deadpal> Are you going to try this out with multiplayer pat? This game is great in multiplayer.
[2:35:12] <a_a_ronin> EDF5 or Iron Rain?
[2:35:12] <3xgilly> MoNsTeRs
[2:35:14] <EBT93> I can‚Äôt believe Richard Epcar was in EDF 4.1
[2:35:14] <%Afterman_> the edf series is basically the movie the producers in video game form
[2:35:16] <Rashnam> Fencer gets much better once you have more weapons to work with
[2:35:18] <%mastertwin2> They got EDF from eating a mega meal from a Chinese KFC
[2:35:19] <+VietcongSamurai> EDF5 easy
[2:35:19] <Tucker0603> ok, Pat not man enough for big boy fencer
[2:35:21] <Renkage> I understand. Fencer is rough if you don't have the tech
[2:35:29] <borous> Classes other than ranger are more equipment dependent and more complicated @AngriestPat
[2:35:31] <thetyrantcbass> 5 over iron rain any day
[2:35:31] <kingdudeby> ominous
[2:35:31] <%VantomPayne> no Hard difficulty gives better loot drops
[2:35:33] <%Kenori> This game feels like propaganda for a military that doesn't exist
[2:35:35] <%Rain_Mage> Everything is fine, TRUST ME
[2:35:37] <@SSaryn> I should mention Shotguns and also fucking amazing in this game.
[2:35:38] <%VantomPayne> apatDab
[2:35:39] <krymzen5> monsters
[2:35:39] <%SuichiTanaka> Fencers are neat, but unfun until you learn how to do constant dash cancels, IMO
[2:35:43] <leroyslammin> I just realized every gun in EDF is stronger than any gun in Anthem. They literally destroy any enemy in that setting with one shot.
[2:35:44] <sileo_patronus> This mission is fine for AR
[2:35:44] <%SergeantSov> Spiders on this mission I think
[2:35:48] <+punit216> pylons
[2:35:56] <robbierottensrottenrectum> ur fighting lack of rest
[2:35:59] <+VietcongSamurai> Equip airstrikes
[2:36:04] <leroyslammin> They are constructing additional Pylons
[2:36:05] <TheAimless> pretty sure its spiders
[2:36:17] <MoulesFritz> >air raider
[2:36:19] <Louie_Salmon> Man that's a lot of number to go big
[2:36:20] <%foreverN2dust> @SSaryn shotguns are godly as long as they don't have some weird spread

[2:37:59] <Renkage> You don't have to equip them to continue to reload

[2:39:27] <+Spec7re> Someone needs to eat these spoodlers

[2:39:52] <L0rd_TriHard> @Louie_Salmon how doo actual soldiers talk ?
[2:39:53] <+RealPT1> limpet guns will be air raiders main form of attack
[2:39:54] <Tennochief> Exterminatus is for when the mosquitos show up
[2:39:57] <+VietcongSamurai> EDF 5 limpets guns are pretty bad
[2:39:58] <sileo_patronus> @MoulesFritz hey now snipers are good for ships
[2:39:58] <%connos_procrastination> Wish theyd just give air raiders machenny guns the limpits are awfull
[2:39:58] <+A0N33> I don't even use the Limpet Guns anymore, I just use Gunship Call-ins instead since they have a cooldown instead of point requirement now
[2:39:58] <Renkage> Yeah. As chat said. Limpet guns aren't what Air Raider do
[2:40:00] <Tennochief> after that, then fuck this earth
[2:40:02] <%fFailureatlife> this feels like if a shitty unity asset flip was amazing
[2:40:03] <%ArcanumMBD> I love Air Raider, but it is pure trash at the start
[2:40:04] <%foreverN2dust> @MoulesFritz fencer propaganda, some are okay, but just okay
[2:40:05] <Mr_Strut> Did you know that you're never more than 5 feet away from a spider? It's true!
[2:40:06] <%Cthulos> leroyslammin the aliens are working on it LUL
[2:40:14] <Louie_Salmon> @EBT93 But if they exploded into guts as soon as someone shot it, it would probably be managable
[2:40:16] <%depressed_skeleton> Don't look down on me!
[2:40:18] <%GeneralSCPatton> Pride500 This alternate earth that never had insects or arachnids is fucking weird. How does the food chain wo- BUT SHUT UP THO!
[2:40:18] <Mr_Strut> The magic school bus taught me that, and it ruined my life.
[2:40:21] <%yeknomlive> i like the dude that says 'dont look down on me' to a big ass spider
[2:40:43] <thetyrantcbass> In this game, air raider has lots of cannon attacks that automatically reload even without kills
[2:40:44] <+RealPT1> they'll eventually be a limpet shotgun that does better
[2:40:46] <Louie_Salmon> I mean, the way these soldiers talk, they all seem like idiots, and they're still kicking alien ass
[2:40:49] <%riderstrike152> Angriest Wat squashing all the spooders

[2:41:07] <%Diabetic> the music's ok
[2:41:09] <mukbun> all this rolling we OOT now boys
[2:41:11] <Manwad> turn this game into a tower defense
[2:41:11] <leroyslammin> @yeknomlive Imagine if the Spider actually respected his wishes and looked him in the eye on equal ground
[2:41:12] <%foreverN2dust> putting the turrets on the blades of a helicopter is the best
[2:41:14] <EBT93> @louie_salmon Just the fact that giant spiders exist would make me shuffle off my mortal coil.

[2:44:42] <+TardyClock> It absolutely looks like an early PS3 game

[2:44:53] <tetriata> Grape is best vehicle
[2:44:54] <TURBOSUPLEX3000> @moonlight_grimoire also there are vehicles that multiple players can enter and fencer weapons that require an air raider to establish lock on
[2:44:55] <Tennochief> YES
[2:44:58] <L0rd_TriHard> hes right though you coulda told me this game came out in 2007 or something LUL
[2:45:00] <jeffishype> just dont use that limbpet gun again
[2:45:00] <+VietcongSamurai> go to the left
[2:45:02] <+Grayhammatter> you got a bunch of grapes pat
[2:45:03] <@SSaryn> Have Elmo just throw his hair all over the place and that will stop the monsters
[2:45:05] <Jack_of_No_Trades> this series always feels like a modern remake of some dreamcast game to me
[2:45:09] <%Typhaeon> Holy shit that gun's awesome
[2:45:10] <Renkage> SUPPRESS IS FUCKING BAD
[2:45:12] <+OkamiDude15> a robomb if you will
[2:45:12] <TheAimless> range... 16 meters
[2:45:13] <copyritetm> feels more like a late ps2 game personally
[2:45:14] <tetriata> Oh man, supress gun is so bad
[2:45:20] <%foreverN2dust> @Manwad 4.1 is still fun, tons of missions and a lot of things you can do that are super broken
[2:45:20] <sileo_patronus> Suppress gun is for when you get grabbed, that's it
[2:45:22] <+PlushMines> Its REAL bad
[2:45:22] <%Typhaeon> Of course it sucks, it looks too cool
[2:45:26] <Renkage> It's the WORST GUN IN THE GAME
[2:45:32] <TheDr0t> AIRSTRIKE EM
[2:45:38] <+PlushMines> It's a situational tool, not really a gun
[2:45:42] <+VERDAXY> you need a beam sword or freakin buster sword
[2:45:42] <$Dakuu75> where's the "request nuke" option?
[2:45:43] <Renkage> I will stand by that. IT'S WORSE THEN THE BODY PILLOW
[2:45:43] <%demegodz> apatGib apatGib apatGib
[2:45:44] <Manwad> its da babey
[2:45:46] <%foreverN2dust> The vehicles though
[2:45:49] <+punit216> gunships are better limpets
[2:45:49] <%Solidnick18> apatGib apatGib apatGib apatGib
[2:45:51] <TheWe4pon> @AngriestPat some of the old credit based weapons are now just time based.
[2:45:53] <%GeneralSCPatton> Just create a giant cat to push the monsters off the edge of the flat Earth.
[2:45:55] <tetriata> If all your slots on Air Raider aren't calling in artillery or gunships, you're doing it wrong
[2:45:55] <sileo_patronus> @Dakuu75 later
[2:45:56] <TheAimless> theres exactly 2 missions where the supress gun is useful actually
[2:46:00] <smtpyrojack> Baby!
[2:46:01] <muetank> sasslyB
[2:46:03] <@SSaryn> I forgot the Body pillow was in this game.
[2:46:10] <TURBOSUPLEX3000> request gunship are generally fast enough to be a replacement for limpets
[2:46:14] <+VERDAXY> Wheres the GIANT SWORDS AT?
[2:46:15] <+OkamiDude15> @Renkage are you telling me there is a body pillow as a weapon in this game? woopsHyper
[2:46:18] <%connos_procrastination> SHEER HEART ATTACKo
[2:46:20] <+punit216> explosive romba
[2:46:21] <sileo_patronus> It's just an explosive roomba
[2:46:21] <+Grayhammatter> that's silly
[2:46:24] <Ninja_Kareca> MercyWing1 EDF MercyWing2
[2:46:30] <%foreverN2dust> Dakimakura explosive decoys
[2:46:32] <MaxXtreme23> hey how's everyone doing
[2:46:35] <tetriata> @OkamiDude15 Yes. It's overpriced DLC though and it's not actually that good
[2:46:36] <%ArcanumMBD> Slow reload, more damage
[2:46:38] <Tennochief> REAL CARDIAC
[2:46:39] <ProfessorLitmus> these games are made by the same people that made R.A.D. on the ps2( one of my favorite shit games ever)
[2:46:39] <Scyllas> Is EDF in same universe of Metal Wolf Chaos?
[2:46:39] <TheWe4pon> @AngriestPat might i suggest the auto cannon
[2:46:47] <TheAimless> @AngriestPat try the autocannon in gunships instead of the limpets, they reload quickly enough and track enemies
[2:46:47] <Renkage> @OkamiDude15 For Fencer. And you had to pre-order the PS4 version. Not sure if its obtainable in the PC version
[2:46:47] <%VantomPayne> @AngriestPat you havent get a mission where you need snipers to take out priority target yet
[2:46:51] <@SSaryn> Snipers generally arent all that great but havent played air raider so eh
[2:46:51] <+PlushMines> Look at some of your cannon call-ins
[2:46:55] <%ArcanumMBD> Got any gunship call downs?
[2:46:57] <sileo_patronus> @AngriestPat request gunships are great since they reload normally unlike most artillery
[2:46:57] <TheDr0t> sheer cat attack have no weaknesses
[2:46:59] <JSTM2> combat bomber
[2:47:00] <NeroInfinite> yes
[2:47:01] <robbierottensrottenrectum> yeah
[2:47:01] <Rashnam> yes
[2:47:01] <+Grayhammatter> yes
[2:47:03] <+PlushMines> Autocannon!
[2:47:04] <%ArcanumMBD> Gunships are great. They auto reload
[2:47:05] <%foreverN2dust> YES
[2:47:05] <Renkage> Yes
[2:47:07] <+Grayhammatter> and GRAPE
[2:47:07] <Tennochief> GUNSHIP
[2:47:07] <@SSaryn> Ye
[2:47:07] <%VantomPayne> either of them
[2:47:09] <Jack_of_No_Trades> yoop
[2:47:11] <TURBOSUPLEX3000> replace limpet gun with request gunship category stuff
[2:47:11] <%VantomPayne> better, all of them
[2:47:17] <+d00msdaydan> gunship is what you want
[2:47:18] <%ArcanumMBD> Bring 1 gunship 1 bomber or artillery
[2:47:18] <TheDr0t> all the airstrikes
[2:47:20] <sileo_patronus> IT'S ALL GOOD
[2:47:21] <%hawk_rush> idk
[2:47:22] <krymzen5> gunship
[2:47:24] <+OkamiDude15> @Renkage well now im not as excited about it but thats still hilarious
[2:47:26] <%Niney_Who> those are Airstrikes
[2:47:28] <ProfessorLitmus> dude if you play the right class you can get a giant punch mech
[2:47:31] <thetyrantcbass> Bomber and cannon
[2:47:32] <tetriata> Air Raider doesn't need a gun
[2:47:32] <+PlushMines> 2 sec reload

[2:47:36] <thelonechris> Limp Bizkit

[2:47:40] <@SSaryn> Gunships are generally better but combat bomber is good enough
[2:47:41] <robbierottensrottenrectum> @AngriestPat gunships can just straight up replace the limpet guns later on
[2:47:41] <%Dapper_Cactuar> Pat, the life vendor heals allies and enemies alike
[2:47:42] <%foreverN2dust> fuck limpet and vendor, get both
[2:47:46] <%ArcanumMBD> @AngriestPat Bring the 2 gunships, and then either bomber or artillery

[2:54:11] <+VERDAXY> ITS THE SAFEST
[2:54:12] <+PlushMines> Yeah its more about the blast radius
[2:54:12] <SoySocks> seems like it took about the same time as an air strike
[2:54:13] <%SirGO0SE> but special beam canon

[2:56:00] <%SirGO0SE> he's okay
[2:56:02] <%Nymphonomicon> DEW it!
[2:56:06] <%jiin6> Machine Guns
[2:56:06] <$Dakuu75> jesus, they need to tone down the cries-for-help or add a few more variables XD
[2:56:09] <+CharredChord> you can stick turrets on a motorbike for ultimate high speed carnage
[2:56:13] <%fFailureatlife> YOU GOT WEBBED monkaS

[2:56:26] <+SolverCODO> Did all the screaming clue you in?
[2:56:28] <Ninja_Kareca> MASS ENLISTMENT
[2:56:28] <TenWren> press are not citizens
[2:56:29] <%puhff> This is the most chaotic game
[2:56:31] <%Ne1son> There WERE civilians there
[2:56:38] <%yeknomlive> those civies eating aoe's like a champ
[2:56:38] <DocHankenstein> Save the citizens by bombing the shit out the area pat
[2:56:41] <thetyrantcbass> Civvies are immortal, worry not
[2:56:45] <%ShichiNoBushi> "Collateral damage"? Is that weaponry I put up when I want to get a loan?
[2:56:50] <%GarbageNirvana> This feels arcadey as hell
[2:56:52] <animalxer> New grape ready
[2:56:53] <$Dakuu75> acceptable losses
[2:56:54] <Jack_of_No_Trades> Glass the surface to defeat the aliens

[2:56:56] <%logoth_> I didnt know this game had twitch prime skins
[2:56:58] <%fFailureatlife> lmao that texture
[2:57:02] <%hawk_rush> please don't
[2:57:04] <MaxXtreme23> you know being in this close proximity to spiders is really fucking uncomfortable
[2:57:05] <JSTM2> Civs are ment to be meatshields in this game
[2:57:05] <Tennochief> get fucked spider
[2:57:07] <%doc_ock_rokc> To be fair if an alien invasion happened I'd enlist
[2:57:07] <%depressed_skeleton> i'm immortal?
[2:57:07] <alwayspronking> that's great out of context
[2:57:09] <animalxer> slap turrets on the grape
[2:57:11] <OctoBazooka> just like real civilians
[2:57:12] <robbierottensrottenrectum> civilians cant be attacked if they're fucking DEAD
[2:57:16] <mar_krow> Get all up in those spider guts
[2:57:19] <%b0neh34d> I will bring you back safely!
[2:57:19] <%furiousfurioso> I can't believe I never tried Air Raider
[2:57:24] <%fFailureatlife> real spiders are friends
[2:57:26] <+Grayhammatter> more grape
[2:57:29] <TURBOSUPLEX3000> I thought this was the earth defense force not the civilian defence force
[2:57:30] <Ninja_Kareca> Turret mounted Grape, let's go!!!!
[2:57:31] <+Spec7re> That dude has been going on since the start of the game about bringing you back safely
[2:57:32] <thetyrantcbass> Just be careful about bombing other soldiers because they‚Äôre super useful
[2:57:36] <Renkage> Me and my friends have a saying for EDF. "Storm Team: You knew the risks". YOU called US, there is going to be collateral
[2:58:06] <%TheCrispyBoi> air raider seems fum
[2:58:10] <Daxalog> I like the way he says Machine Guns
[2:58:16] <Moonlight_Grimoire> ... This class is just stand powers, the class.
[2:58:17] <robbierottensrottenrectum> monkaS
[2:58:20] <krymzen5> i had no idea air raider was so cool in 5
[2:58:21] <+PlushMines> @Renkage that's outstanding
[2:58:28] <+Robopengy> Does this game use the Deadly Premonition engine?

[2:58:52] <+ntr_nakadashi> This is really strange. I'm severely arachnophobic, but these things aren't doing it for me
[2:58:56] <Ninja_Kareca> @angriestpat get Paige to couch co-op with you
[2:59:05] <Renkage> The buildings are working for the spiders! Blow them up
[2:59:08] <alwayspronking> to protect our mother from any alien attack

[2:59:20] <CalderGaming> that's a name alright
[2:59:23] <%fFailureatlife> EDF
[2:59:23] <Dr_Mooose> same
[2:59:24] <SoySocks> they are the cute jumping spiders
[2:59:25] <+Grayhammatter> KAMUY
[2:59:25] <moosemonkey397> the A-Team Jingle at the end iof each level is amazing
[2:59:26] <Mr_Strut> nakadashi?
[2:59:26] <%mostundesired> EDF
[2:59:26] <%Diabetic> well they're doing it for ME
[2:59:27] <%RupanSen> nakadashi? LUL
[2:59:28] <+TardyClock> It doesn't trigger it because they look too fake.
[2:59:29] <+VietcongSamurai> New bombers pog
[2:59:30] <%GarbageNirvana> They don't move like spiders
[2:59:31] <+d00msdaydan> is it because they have big cute eyes
[2:59:31] <+ntr_nakadashi> Yeah I dunno why these spiders don't look like spiders to me. Even though they're spiders
[2:59:32] <Ion_Laser> EDF EDF EDF
[2:59:34] <sileo_patronus> NIX A YEAH
[2:59:34] <+kuervojones> They are doing it for me rooSmug
[2:59:34] <%SirGO0SE> LASER GUIDE KIT
[2:59:39] <thetyrantcbass> KAMUY
[2:59:41] <CalderGaming> that's the japanese slang for creampie
[2:59:42] <robbierottensrottenrectum> :O
[2:59:43] <CopperTucker> @AngriestPat I too am very arachnophobic and this is also fine
[2:59:43] <%fFailureatlife> its because they're big and dumb
[2:59:44] <+TardyClock> They just sorta awkwardly bounce.
[2:59:44] <Sapphire_Breeze> nakadashi is a good tag
[2:59:45] <%titans_ace_jerid> EXO-SKELETON
[2:59:50] <+SkitsofRandom> they don't really move like spiders
[2:59:50] <aimlesshealer> I guess 'cause they're not tiny crawlies, they're big jumpies
[2:59:53] <%doc_ock_rokc> @ntr_nakadashi Yeah I have a phobia of zombies and L4d helped me to get over it in a way
[2:59:57] <Manwad> i can't believe those were the level 0 weapons
[3:00:03] <+daisyyyy> Giant bugs are legit less triggering for some reason
[3:00:05] <sileo_patronus> MECH TIME?
[3:00:06] <%Diabetic> Tell me the spiders stop ._.
[3:00:07] <Renkage> @ntr_nakadashi My theory is it's because they are big. Spiders are scary because they are small creatures that can kill you in one bite. These spiders don't even bite
[3:00:15] <Futurecity10> Thats a fucking name
[3:00:15] <$Dakuu75> they're kinda floaty. like baloons, they dont really move like a giant bug
[3:00:20] <CalderGaming> why bite when you can shtomp
[3:00:29] <TheWe4pon> 5 shots vs 1
[3:00:30] <%foreverN2dust> @Manwad imagine what you get on one of the 4 harder difficulties
[3:00:31] <%ArcanumMBD> Kamuy is great
[3:00:32] <%AncelDeLambert> @AngriestPat part of it is that the spiders are polygonized, but most of it is that they're HUGE and it doesn't trigger when you can PUNCH THEM
[3:00:33] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Dakuu75 How many flying buggs have you seen?

[3:27:22] <TenWren> why did everyone go ahead with the airstrikes even though they questioned the civilian
[3:27:27] <+IWantMyFamilyBack> To save our mother Earth from any alien attack From vicious giant insects who have once again come back We'll unleash all our forces, we won't cut them any
[3:27:27] <%Gray_skies1993> DUDE that armor for the Fencer looks dope af
[3:27:30] <krymzen5> those panties are for aerodynamics
[3:27:36] <Jack_of_No_Trades> Clothes are universally un-aerodynamic. Just science
[3:27:41] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @Tennochief seemed like a good idea at the time
[3:27:41] <Tennochief> EDF is 10x braver than any PDF
[3:27:46] <beetbo2> Metal wolf chaos x EDF anyone???
[3:27:46] <sileo_patronus> @king_wragles lore reason is weight, real reason is shut up tho

[3:28:13] <@SSaryn> if only he had the body pillow
[3:28:15] <MoulesFritz> EDF are cowards with superweapons, PDF do it all with flashlights and paper vests
[3:28:18] <%ArcanumMBD> Artillery and Bombers are all credits. Some satellites are reload, some are credits. Same with missiles.
[3:28:20] <%Gray_skies1993> yeah keep the Autocannon it reloads super fast
[3:28:21] <+Pookiedaexzile> @robbierottensrottenrectum Question answered I see
[3:28:28] <JSTM2> This next mission might be a bit awkward because you need to shoot (spoilers) dropships
[3:28:30] <LimitedTimeGamer> Kyoani is on fire right now. FeelsBadMan
[3:28:44] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @MoulesFritz counterpoint: EDF has currently retreated 0 times

[3:28:48] <+Pookiedaexzile> MOC are a proud order of the EDF
[3:28:48] <%connos_procrastination> AS humans our souls are truly wieghed down by clothing
[3:28:48] <TheAimless> @AngriestPat take something with good range, else you'll be stuck in this mission for a while

[3:30:28] <%Gray_skies1993> damn, well, can't just nuke all of them down
[3:30:31] <Tennochief> Nukes would make things worse
[3:30:31] <+Jrocy247> It's 5 months of war and NOTHING was destroyed.
[3:30:33] <TenWren> oh all right, don't clarify

[3:35:39] <DrBeanie> SO COOL
[3:35:43] <tank7013> This sergeant guy is actually super competent as far as NPC soldiers go. Like he's got strats down for some later enemies too.
[3:35:45] <robbierottensrottenrectum> your airstrikes are wimpy
[3:35:45] <%Solidnick18> lol
[3:35:46] <+Jrocy247> You, a normal human with a assault rifle, is able to destroy a giant alien ship....Yea that sounds about right.
[3:35:47] <%demegodz> OH
[3:35:49] <+SolverCODO> mother = destroyed
[3:35:54] <PKHTjim> That Splash Damage is real.
[3:35:55] <Youwereeatenbyalid> fEEL THE HEAT
[3:36:02] <+Grayhammatter> that minion buster is busted
[3:36:03] <Tennochief> that's rad
[3:36:04] <+TheLakinessMonster> Calling in an airstrike will never be as intimate as pulling the trigger yourself.
[3:36:04] <+CharredChord> SPLAsh
[3:36:05] <%Dapper_Cactuar> rocket launchers always feel great in these games
[3:36:07] <HeadsHeldHigh> satisfying
[3:36:09] <Moonlight_Grimoire> I honestly don't know what class I would go for, because the heavy class is like classic armored core and that is UNF to me
[3:36:09] <fIashman92> You eventually get air strike rockets
[3:36:10] <+twohitgood> is this the new splatoon level?
[3:36:12] <%doc_ock_rokc> Do people still want to do Peace talks!
[3:36:27] <PKHTjim> How come I have never seen this game until now.
[3:36:28] <Tennochief> genestealer cults do
[3:36:31] <tank7013> @doc_ock_rokc Yes
[3:36:32] <Captain_Joe1911> Get em' Pat! heart2Whatthe
[3:36:33] <%GohanEgret> look at this roadie run
[3:36:39] <Ion_Laser> YEET
[3:36:40] <DashXero> I love how they just embrace the jank.
[3:36:46] <thetyrantcbass> It just came out on Steam
[3:36:48] <+d00msdaydan> oh my god it's totally a fucking roadie run holy shit
[3:36:48] <Tennochief> oh fuck there were genestealers in the government
[3:36:54] <%snow_bush> Alright, night all!
[3:36:55] <animalxer> @PKHTjim yes, even months later
[3:36:55] <%QueequegTheater> cheer500 Pat is your character the original WH40K Thunder Warrior? I ask this because more people need to know about Thunder Warriors
[3:36:56] <+attackofthesage> EDF is just one of those series that plenty of people love but nobody ever talks about
[3:37:04] <robbierottensrottenrectum> the land is white because aliens have been fucking the earth for 5 months
[3:37:08] <PKHTjim> This looks friggin fun.
[3:37:11] <beetbo2> LUL LUL
[3:37:22] <%Dapper_Cactuar> it is Jim
[3:37:25] <+Estuko> @attackofthesage but if you shout out EDF, you'll get a proper response from those who do know
[3:37:27] <%foreverN2dust> EZ Clap
[3:37:28] <noobpsyboticus> I will shill for this series anytime anywhere. even my non gamer girlfriend loves it
[3:37:39] <noobpsyboticus> it's like a perfect co op game
[3:37:39] <+attackofthesage> @Estuko true
[3:37:43] <%Gray_skies1993> almost
[3:37:45] <Jack_of_No_Trades> good shots tho
[3:37:48] <Tennochief> For those of you who don't know, Thunder Warriors were the precursors to Space Marines used by the Emoeror of Mankind during the Reunification Wars
[3:37:48] <%Dapper_Cactuar> this mission is a blast to farm weapons and armor on
[3:37:55] <%Ne1son> Negative, did't go in. Just impacted on the surface
[3:38:04] <Youwereeatenbyalid> "COME ON DOWN!"
[3:38:07] <Tennochief> They were effective but boy were they violent psychopaths
[3:38:07] <DashXero> Open wide, mofos!
[3:38:08] <SaltyAzteca> Up Yooooours!
[3:38:10] <+Jrocy247> Your assault rifle does more damage to the ship than a fucking rocket
[3:38:13] <+Grayhammatter> missing ever single shot
[3:38:20] <%GohanEgret> rip suburb
[3:38:20] <+VietcongSamurai> EDF
[3:38:22] <beetbo2> Is this the guardsman simulator?
[3:38:25] <Ion_Laser> EDF
[3:38:26] <robbierottensrottenrectum> intimidation rolled 1
[3:38:26] <%Gray_skies1993> NICE SHOT
[3:38:29] <%Zaxshimysham> Stay out of reach is the answer i guess
[3:38:29] <%Solidnick18> lol
[3:38:30] <Strider222> EDF
[3:38:33] <$BoSteed> I'll remember you... whoever you are.
[3:38:33] <%Rain_Mage> You will remember me
[3:38:33] <%QueequegTheater> @beetbo2 Yup
[3:38:34] <+CharredChord> that sounded very sincere
[3:38:38] <%connos_procrastination> senpai noticed !
[3:38:38] <Captain_Joe1911> heart2Whatthe
[3:38:39] <Nemesis2098> omg this is jsut edf4 I love it
[3:38:44] <HeadsHeldHigh> noo
[3:38:47] <+Robopengy> Higher mortality rate for Guardsmen :p
[3:38:47] <TheAimless> not enough flashlights
[3:38:49] <HeadsHeldHigh> You'd be dead
[3:38:50] <%doc_ock_rokc> Fucking xenos
[3:38:51] <+WaywardSera> not enough guardsman casualties
[3:38:56] <%foreverN2dust> dialog is on par Kappa
[3:38:57] <+d00msdaydan> just replace the assault rifles with flashlights
[3:38:57] <Zombrocom> Except imperial guardsmen tend to die
[3:38:57] <Renkage> And Fencer is Space Marine
[3:38:59] <%Doruben> you havent died yet so no
[3:39:00] <+TheLakinessMonster> Where are the bayonets?
[3:39:01] <+BoomerTiro> Not that close to guardsmen since you haven't lost an entire platoon of guys
[3:39:04] <DashXero> Those people don't have houses anymore.
[3:39:04] <Tennochief> However once Big E made the Golden Banana men and reunified Earth,all the Thunder Warriors were taken out back behind the shed
[3:39:05] <%doc_ock_rokc> @WaywardSera 2 billion not enough?
[3:39:05] <%Rngiddion> an imperial guardsmans day dreams as he suffers in a hell trench maybe
[3:39:08] <%luftraumm1> it reminds me of a game for the n64
[3:39:08] <Zombrocom> 99% casualties, still a victory
[3:39:08] <+JurassicRebel> Guardsmen weapons are nowhere NEAR this effective
[3:39:10] <robbierottensrottenrectum> EDF
[3:39:11] <%QueequegTheater> WHERE'S My GAUNT'S GHOSTS METAL GEAR GAME?
[3:39:11] <Youwereeatenbyalid> Welp, WAR OVER
[3:39:12] <%Solidnick18> how many more monsters
[3:39:13] <Sanyle> america!
[3:39:16] <tank7013> Wing diver is so fuckin' fun in this after you get air dashing down
[3:39:19] <+WaywardSera> @doc_ock_rokc civvies don't count
[3:39:19] <Moonlight_Grimoire> I mean yeah this is a guardsmen game, but you play a stormtrooper
[3:39:26] <Tennochief> ^
[3:39:29] <%Yadogari> ARM HOUND YEAH
[3:39:29] <+Grayhammatter> napalm? wtf?
[3:39:29] <+Jrocy247> You saved the world with your no shit tactic
[3:39:30] <%Dapper_Cactuar> especially since the Fencers in EDF 4.1 look like anime versions of Warhammer marines
[3:39:30] <Baconrath> building is a fuck 4.787,343 ants dead
[3:39:31] <+Robopengy> @QueequegTheater At the rate they pump out 40k games, probably next week
[3:39:35] <Cranky_Construct> So what you're saying
[3:39:35] <Monkeyweed21> YE ARM HOUND
[3:39:37] <+VERDAXY> We need to start riding this bugs and using them against the ALIENS.
[3:39:39] <+tymetak> Play Wing Diver üò°
[3:39:41] <+WaywardSera> number go up!?
[3:39:41] <%doc_ock_rokc> @WaywardSera if they can ohold a gun they are a guardsmen
[3:39:44] <Cranky_Construct> Is this game is an Imperial Guardsman's wet dream
[3:39:48] <%ShichiNoBushi> "EDF!!" *missile* "EDF!!" *building explodes* "EDF!!"
[3:39:49] <sileo_patronus> G&M is great
[3:39:49] <MicrotonalMatt> Nobody tell Peach about Necrons
[3:39:52] <%QueequegTheater> @Robopengy Chris Hemsworth as Corbec or we riot
[3:39:55] <Youwereeatenbyalid> Burn, baby BURN
[3:39:58] <+WaywardSera> @doc_ock_rokc you're thinking colonial militia
[3:40:00] <HeadsHeldHigh> You'd get a leg blown off, stay alive long enough to drive back the aliens, then the Fencers would show up to claim glory
[3:40:01] <Jack_of_No_Trades> volatile napalm = slow and steady
[3:40:03] <Cranky_Construct> No commisar to worry about as he blasts shit with crazy ordinance
[3:40:07] <+Grayhammatter> oh fugg
[3:40:13] <DashXero> @Cranky_Construct doodBro Yo!

[3:41:31] <+OkamiDude15> aim for the center mass
[3:41:32] <AoG_JarlRaven> Save meeeeeeeee
[3:41:33] <Tennochief> IT AINT ME

[3:41:43] <AoG_JarlRaven> Wake me up wake me up inside.....
[3:41:46] <%Dapper_Cactuar> @DashXero I have this game on PS4 if you want to join me and some friends for some missions one of these days

[3:42:21] <%Zaxshimysham> @AngriestPat you didn't even fork over cash for the Waifu truck? wtf is wrong with you sir?
[3:42:23] <%foreverN2dust> how could this be
[3:42:23] <+Grayhammatter> underGROUND?
[3:42:24] <%doc_ock_rokc> Like ...ants
[3:42:25] <beetbo2> Vietnam colorized
[3:42:28] <tank7013> Yea so all insects can just spawn in now. Just like out of the ground
[3:42:29] <Monkeyweed21> like some kind of insectoid?
[3:42:30] <%internetexplorer11> internetexplorer11 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 1 month streak! time to give the covenant back their bomb
[3:42:32] <+Grayhammatter> how can this BE?
[3:42:32] <%Rngiddion> how can this beeeee
[3:42:34] <%cryobyjorn> cryobyjorn subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 30 months! "Women whomst haveth profession of questionable background are showing strongeth displeasure regardeth current events" - Urianger
[3:42:39] <+Dumb_Parrot> They never once realize these are ants, do they?...
[3:42:39] <CatsDrunkonCopper> The ants dug holes?
[3:42:40] <%GarbageNirvana> I refuse to believe this planet is Earth
[3:42:43] <%ShichiNoBushi> The giant ants dug holes and came from underground?!
[3:42:44] <%AncelDeLambert> I have to say... these bioweapons aren't very effective
[3:42:44] <%depressed_skeleton> Or giant wombats
[3:42:47] <fIashman92> @JSTM2 Tagging aliens with napalm will cause them to roll around like idiots, which is fun
[3:42:52] <+Jrocy247> The NPCs are fucking these ants up
[3:42:56] <%jiin6> Stupid Aliens you invade from space, not from EArth
[3:43:00] <%GeneralSCPatton> Pride500 For everyone else who just bought this, the most important thing is to turn off fullscreen and use a borderless window program. Fullscreen murders the framerate and makes it stutter hard.
[3:43:00] <HeadsHeldHigh> SPLORCH
[3:43:03] <%king_wragles> She should ask for permission for pants
[3:43:06] <%TheSniperJoe> Man those tunnels alone have utterly fucked this whole residential area. The risk of collapse and sinkholes just went up SOOOOO much.
[3:43:08] <%Dapper_Cactuar> @DashXero one of the later missions in 4.1 has you defend a dozen giant robots from insects as they fist fight a small army of kaiju
[3:43:12] <PKHTjim> Wow
[3:43:20] <HeadsHeldHigh> look at da blud
[3:43:20] <Bailey__gaming> Free House painting by pat
[3:43:22] <%GarbageNirvana> How are you sure YOU'RE not the aliens
[3:43:22] <+d00msdaydan> if it's not earth then what is the earth defense force defending? checkmate, atheists
[3:43:22] <%ShichiNoBushi> Next they're going to say the giant spiders make webs.
[3:43:25] <+Dumb_Parrot> Why not... webs?
[3:43:30] <beetbo2> Jesus wow
[3:43:34] <beetbo2> The carnage
[3:43:34] <DashXero> @Dapper_Cactuar That sounds positively bonkers in the best way.
[3:43:35] <xeros720> feels like there might be a late game napalm that covers a really wide area
[3:43:36] <%doc_ock_rokc> What if the xenos...was the Imerium!
[3:43:38] <+OkamiDude15> we should just shoot the civis with napalm and have them run through the horde to kill the aliens
[3:43:44] <+Jrocy247> Holy shit they're absolutely destroying all of these spiders
[3:43:45] <DracaenaLeaf> Is is a lot of grape juice
[3:43:48] <DracaenaLeaf> this*
[3:43:49] <fIashman92> It's more for area denial than damage
[3:43:51] <+Grayhammatter> that semi auto is doing damage
[3:43:52] <Tennochief> @doc_ock_rokc yes Inquisitor, this man right here
[3:43:52] <%doc_ock_rokc> fuck I can't spell today
[3:43:54] <TheAimless> aoe-dot / area-denial more than anything imo
[3:43:58] <%QueequegTheater> @OkamiDude15 Now you're thinking like an Inquisition officer
[3:44:04] <PKHTjim> Seems to be effective. For a moment I thought we're playing Splatoon.
[3:44:04] <Youwereeatenbyalid> "Hey."
[3:44:05] <%Dapper_Cactuar> @DashXero then a super kaiju shows up and you get to pilot the final giant robot
[3:44:07] <thetyrantcbass> Spiders take a lot of hitstun even if the damage is so so
[3:44:08] <+Spec7re> Monstars!
[3:44:09] <%jiin6> Civillians Escaping? STOP THEM
[3:44:12] <Jack_of_No_Trades> wingdivers HATE webs
[3:44:13] <Moonlight_Grimoire> Purge!
[3:44:14] <+TheBitingIrish> So one armor crate = 1 max HP?
[3:44:15] <+JohnMarkley> good evening everyone :) /

[3:44:17] <%ArcanumMBD> Painting the town with spider blood like a Splatoon squid
[3:44:22] <benjiFG> awesome!
[3:44:27] <Captain_Joe1911> hello @JohnMarkley heart2Kigom /
[3:44:28] <booterdagg> Paul Bearer joins the EDF
[3:44:30] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Tennochief may the Omnissia take you
[3:44:30] <lilo52> Soooo why is Insect Armageddon so hated? This looks exactly like it so far
[3:44:30] <xeros720> oh, a mez type effect might be really good for multiplayer
[3:44:34] <%foreverN2dust> snowso1Goo so gooey
[3:44:48] <+WaywardSera> This game taught me that bugs spontaneously lose 90% of their mass when they die
[3:44:50] <+CharredChord> This purple goo everywhere reminds me of the Cat in the Hat movie
[3:44:53] <+Spec7re> Look at that swagger on those wing divers. Wait. why are they walking?!
[3:45:00] <xeros720> insect armageddon plays much worse, limits weapon drops to the class you're playing, and requires you to farm exp to use better weapons
[3:45:01] <+JohnMarkley> hi @Captain_Joe1911 :D
[3:45:04] <DashXero> @Dapper_Cactuar Well, I guess a bigger robot makes sense.
[3:45:08] <+Jrocy247> We Jeopardized their plan.....A.
[3:45:08] <Dr_Mooose> plan B, drop MORE monsters
[3:45:10] <sileo_patronus> @Spec7re gotta recharge sometime
[3:45:12] <thetyrantcbass> Armor crates are a fraction of HP depending on the class that they get assigned to
[3:45:16] <+Grayhammatter> OH MY GOD
[3:45:16] <%wsintai> EDF 6 needs to replace the giant monsters with giant monster girls get on it NINTENDO
[3:45:17] <%ArcanumMBD> @WaywardSera I mean have you seen how much goo they spray when you shoot them?
[3:45:21] <%jiin6> stupid ant you run AWAY from fire not towards
[3:45:27] <Ion_Laser> plan C, drop EVEN MORE monsters
[3:45:29] <Tennochief> @doc_ock_rokc 01100111 01100101 01110100 00100000 01110011 01101101 01101111 01101011 01100101 01100100 0001010
[3:45:29] <Jack_of_No_Trades> I loved insect Armageddon, but it is different and worse in ways. Miss active reload
[3:45:31] <+WaywardSera> @ArcanumMBD fair point
[3:45:32] <xeros720> and frankly, much lower amount of enemy types, insect armageddon is just really disappointing compared to these real games
[3:45:34] <%Dapper_Cactuar> the spiders in EDF Iron Rain made me nope out. Fairly realistic looking wolf spiders with a bunch of baby spiders on their backs that hop off and rush you
[3:45:34] <thetyrantcbass> divers get less per crate, fencers get more
[3:45:36] <Youwereeatenbyalid> Reminder that 2 billion civilians are dead
[3:45:40] <%foreverN2dust> hitstun
[3:45:40] <%Rngiddion> yeah the napalm seems objectively worse than a grenade
[3:45:41] <sileo_patronus> Napalm hitstuns like a motherfucker
[3:45:57] <DashXero> @Dapper_Cactuar That sounds like a lot of nope.
[3:45:58] <%Cthulos> hitstun
