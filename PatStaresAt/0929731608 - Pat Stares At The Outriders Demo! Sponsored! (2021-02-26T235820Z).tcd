[0:22:06] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> Like she's in a bathroom @PatStaresAt
[0:22:07] <%ssjklyco> Can't tell
[0:22:07] <%necrocannibal2> a bit loud
[0:22:09] <%Aeoneth> Dunno Paiges feed dropped on my end
[0:22:09] <%Teyaric> She sounds like Plaugue. But loud enough
[0:22:09] <FennecZephyr> About just as loud as you

[0:22:14] <%ShinobiPhoenix> first Out riders, soon, the Marriage Life stream
[0:22:14] <+BettyMwwaahh> KINDA loud
[0:22:16] <@StridentSong> You might consider making a Twitch squad with Paige in the future in case you want to dual stream again. People can watch both streams easily that way
[0:22:17] <xXjuffelXx> Pat can't you do the squad stream stuff?
[0:22:17] <%SvenHolgersson> ITS ELI
[0:22:17] <%Dr_DangerPhD> kinda echo-y
[0:22:20] <%depressed_skeleton> The bathroom is her room?
[0:22:20] <Final_Cosplay_Corps> way hotter
[0:22:23] <%Pappajimbo> echo
[0:22:23] <Oxybe> she sounds paige-esque a bit loud
[0:22:25] <Sotetsu> It sounds like she is yelling to you from the bathroom.
[0:22:25] <TheZearGuy> Fine little echo
[0:22:25] <%ShinobiPhoenix> wedding stream
[0:22:25] <%ssjklyco> She's in the bathroom, got it
[0:22:26] <%Ranryu692> she's slightly louder than you, but it doesn't need adjusting
[0:22:26] <%justframejake> Yeah she's taking a dump
[0:22:26] <polandhelped> ECHOO
[0:22:27] <+Shadowofadoubt> her acoustics are bad but her volume is fine

[0:22:31] <+Ancopro> white room no windows
[0:22:31] <@PlagueOfGripes> she needs foam
[0:22:35] <%ChrisPlaysThing> She's louder than when she's in the dungeon
[0:22:37] <+Bupkis7> Does that mean she's sitting on the floor?
[0:22:37] <majindusto> She  sounds like she's  on the Toilet enigmaKEK
[0:22:38] <spryte333> it's fine, just also makes me chuckle
[0:22:40] <%shurtal> put the papyrus body pillow in there, that'll absorb......stuff
[0:22:41] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> No we love the jank, Paige

[0:22:48] <thedank> How can you get engaged when you guys were married for a decade?
[0:22:49] <Sotetsu> If Paige's room is the bathroom, where do you poop, Pat?
[0:22:52] <%Monkeyweed21> use your Papyrus Body Pillows
[0:22:52] <Solleggi> sounds like she is in a can
[0:22:53] <yourliteraldog> Toilet gaming on stream is a power move
[0:22:54] <ovan20> press X to doubt Keepo

[0:23:32] <LoneFonte> uh oh
[0:23:32] <Grandma_Amari> Pat's is buffering too I think
[0:23:34] <dumahiem> plague does all the internet have a square filter now?
[0:23:36] <SilverFaustX> other streamers were also buffering earlier

[0:23:44] <AthenaAegis> Pat's stream is fine, but Paige is buffering for me
[0:23:45] <Sotetsu> I'm looking forward to Paige asking Pat where things are using HER screen for reference.
[0:23:45] <jellssssss20> Does clicking the photo or the link actually do anything for anyone?
[0:23:46] <%cache_22> Paige's stream is buffering every minute or so for me. Pat has been fine for me.

[0:23:55] <sendart> twitch just shitting the bed
[0:23:55] <ExpressNode> Is it because they're streaming at the same time?

[0:23:58] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I reloaded several times
[0:23:59] <jamievardyhavingaparty> bad stream

[0:27:31] <@ShockzNDrawe> so it kept getting worse

[0:39:25] <RAH001> or when u get a new one that u actually want to read but u cannot tell cause u have so many that are still highlighted
[0:39:27] <%depressed_skeleton> Direction bad
[0:39:27] <%ThirdWelles> Now we roll the dice on whether or not the game actually remembers if you've read them or not tho
[0:39:30] <ShichiNoBushi> Goblins slain
[0:39:34] <%BoxNavy> i played this game for a tiny baby amount and it seems pretty cool
[0:39:34] <%JoshManVGH> Damn it! i accidently got to end of demo. I want more!
[0:39:35] <+0raison> it hurts when i play control and have 20 pages i have to read
[0:39:35] <%ShutUpAceyP> why is paige echoed?
[0:39:36] <%ShinobiPhoenix> so is this more Diablo than Destiny?
[0:39:36] <%GalacticaPhanto> Mark as read is a feature I swear should be a default
[0:39:36] <+buttdirt> makes the little noise like in dead space too
[0:39:41] <ToneBacas> nothing will be wong
[0:39:41] <xeros720> Esuna does nothing
[0:39:43] <%greasypete00> what about her grasses
[0:39:46] <+demon1103> things like that make me cry tears of joy, that and default subtitles/ skippable cutscenes
[0:39:47] <%depressed_skeleton> monotaur
[0:39:48] <%ThirdWelles> Because like half the games I've ever played with a "New entry" codex just straight up forget
[0:39:49] <BoneofMalkav> But how long will those glasses last? LUL
[0:39:50] <sire_nukerre> her glasses need glasses
[0:39:50] <@SoFarFetched> no she needs to look closer
[0:39:51] <ExpressNode> I guess this is was what Marvel's Avengers could have been if it was a video game
[0:39:52] <%BoxNavy> i agree :)
[0:39:53] <$PipIV> put your gwasses on
[0:39:56] <+AlphaRayAllen> This looks pretty alright compared to OTHER GAME
[0:39:59] <xeros720> well that ain't happening
[0:39:59] <%ShinobiPhoenix> or really, PSO instead of Destiny
[0:40:01] <Baljhet> being near the zone auto-agrees
[0:40:03] <%BoxNavy> oh hey
[0:40:06] <%laserbeaming> Friendship Door
[0:40:10] <yourliteraldog> Jesus needs to agree too

[0:40:15] <+Shadowofadoubt> oh ok :)
[0:40:16] <%croxeye> this game has a really dumb sense of scale lmao, there's so many many many things of dead people around that you go "there can't have possibly been this many people that were able to come from earth"
[0:40:18] <%chiazam> Oh wow
[0:40:20] <%ThirdWelles> Different animation?
[0:40:24] <%cvp5127> neat

[0:40:48] <sire_nukerre> LUL
[0:40:48] <%BoxNavy> neither of them picked trickster :(
[0:40:49] <+0raison> is that like the world leveling in genshin impact?
[0:40:49] <yourliteraldog> Your pc looks like he was in a prison gang
[0:40:52] <%gitgouda> so what is this division 3?
[0:40:52] <TrollKing96> @PatStaresAt Do you need a Square Enix account to play this?
[0:40:53] <%ThirdWelles> How the fuck did you blast that door open?
[0:40:53] <$PipIV> Diplomacy has failed
[0:40:55] <%cache_22> LUL
[0:40:58] <%necrocannibal2> this is Unreal Engine 4, right? there's something about the graphics that makes it look almost exactly like Gears 5 lol
[0:40:58] <+AlphaRayAllen> I feel like I'm watching E3 with the gamer chatter
[0:40:58] <TopTierHarley> Technomancer Pat
[0:41:01] <%gitgouda> nevermind comment redacted
[0:41:03] <Frostilk> LUL
[0:41:03] <jorniev> WOAH THIS GAME
[0:41:04] <+b_aleph> Is this The Division?
[0:41:05] <@SSaryn> Ice and Decay man.
[0:41:05] <+Shonen_hero> wait is that magic
[0:41:07] <$Skittlesoul> sub zero up in here
[0:41:08] <LoneFonte> @ThirdWelles superpowers
[0:41:09] <+Shonen_hero> is there magic in this
[0:41:09] <%barkon345> @Sdeje she sees her character talking
[0:41:09] <%shurtal> Pat is Val Kilmer, confirmed
[0:41:10] <TopTierHarley> @0raison yes lol
[0:41:11] <+b_aleph> La division?
[0:41:16] <%Pookiedaexzile> YOU HAVE VANQUISHED SLIDES
[0:41:18] <xXVeggiePLusXx> @PatStaresAt is there friendly fire?
[0:41:18] <yourliteraldog> Yay blood
[0:41:19] <%anticrust> What killed the Dinosaurs?  @PatStaresAt
[0:41:20] <xeros720> pat has played one or two of these
[0:41:20] <+TheBitingIrish> SPLORTCH
[0:41:20] <Oxybe> status turrets are just... mmm
[0:41:21] <+demon1103> what...but you can't have multiple player characters in a cutscene....Monster Hunter told me so, they wouldn't lie right?  Right???
[0:41:23] <%chiazam> Wait this game seems fun
[0:41:28] <%ShutUpAceyP> SUB-ZERO!
[0:41:28] <librettodude> I'm liking these gun ratatat-tats
[0:41:30] <jorniev> DARK SCIFI DIVISION?
[0:41:31] <BabyNaBackbrace> Is this a new "Mass Effect 3 MP"?
[0:41:35] <wasdsf> Its like the destiny ice but not awful in every way
[0:41:40] <+TheBitingIrish> So it's 3rd person Destiny?
[0:41:41] <%anticrust> Time to Chill Out!
[0:41:42] <%Teyaric> It's just Magic The Division. Okay.
[0:41:43] <Frostilk> Ice is always nice
[0:41:43] <+AlphaRayAllen> If they don't shatter this game is garbage
[0:41:44] <%barkon345> this looks like the division
[0:41:44] <%JoshManVGH> Melee abilities!
[0:41:47] <TopTierHarley> I'm toast
[0:41:50] <kingmemelord97> how long is the demo ?
[0:41:51] <%ThirdWelles> Ice is an under-utilized element in games
[0:41:54] <+Shonen_hero> I love a game with damage numbers
[0:41:59] <xeros720> paige is a bit crispy
[0:41:59] <+Bupkis7> Paige isn't a very good devastator
[0:42:01] <+Shadowofadoubt> game seems neat but I hope the enemies don't get bullet spongy like in The Division/Warframe

[0:44:31] <%whyskeywolfe> It really is a wish-fulfillment thing
[0:44:31] <%ThirdWelles> My favorite two elements! Ice and Ouch!
[0:44:33] <%nicoleymcquack> Pat is elsa
[0:44:34] <%KeiganOfAstora> Speaking of tanks, Dark Souls 3?
[0:44:34] <Bman1991> check side rooms for chests
[0:44:35] <%BoxNavy> and yet he mains DRK
[0:44:36] <%Mrbaconator> @PatStaresAt isn't your fav class in 14 dark knight though?
[0:44:37] <BabyNaBackbrace> @Aztec50 nailed it

[0:44:50] <%Pookiedaexzile> What are your elemental choices?
[0:44:51] <sire_nukerre> they freeze really fast
[0:44:52] <$Sdeje> I think later Devastator gets healing too. Not in the demo but later in their tree
[0:44:54] <$PipIV> how long does that turret stay up?
[0:44:58] <@SSaryn> @Skittlesoul Scaling difficulty which also affects loot.
[0:44:59] <+Cerabret100> @Skittlesoul enemy level and item drop modifiers
[0:44:59] <%BoxNavy> pat are you going to switch from DRK to SGE?
[0:45:03] <%arcielardor> POWER OF GUN
[0:45:04] <%dekkitout> World tiers are essentially difficulty slider/real time ng+
[0:45:07] <Manwad> It had super good uptime assuming its not destoryed
[0:45:08] <@ShockzNDrawe> ssaryns a ner who plays video games
[0:45:13] <allanmiri> Back when I played a bit of FO4 I filled all my bases with turrets because I love turrets.
[0:45:14] <TopTierHarley> I played the close range Assassin
[0:45:15] <Khester824> is pat playing on Ps5 and Paign on PC?
[0:45:16] <%BoxNavy> KILL
[0:45:18] <yourliteraldog> just shoot

[0:45:28] <dots4eyes> Squishy
[0:45:33] <%depressed_skeleton> as people do

[0:45:34] <%cache_22> Give us gibs
[0:45:36] <%chiazam> Can you switch between classes?
[0:45:38] <%rytisone> Gears of War style
[0:45:38] <%ThirdWelles> *theirs
[0:45:41] <@SSaryn> @ThirdWelles Nah it's just, it's scaling as the game goes on and if you die, it decreases.
[0:45:41] <Khester824> cool
[0:45:41] <@SoFarFetched> @SSaryn @ShockzNDrawe Both are nerds gottem
[0:45:42] <@StridentSong> @PatStaresAt Dude immediately requested an unban saying he let a friend access his account. So I went ahead and looked at his chat history. I guess this "friend" had access to his chat every single time he's used Twitch.
[0:45:44] <TopTierHarley> no
[0:45:44] <+Cerabret100> @ThirdWelles no ti just naturally unlockes higher tiers
[0:45:50] <ShichiNoBushi> Why have you betrayed me, turret?
[0:45:52] <rufus2k2> oh it's a bouncing betty
[0:45:52] <+Shadowofadoubt> damn yeah they get mulched
[0:45:52] <+ccwettr123> honestly, this looks and seems to feel like what the Division should have been
[0:45:55] <@SSaryn> @StridentSong FUCKING SICK
[0:45:55] <TopTierHarley> Gotta make a new character for a new class
[0:45:56] <+oktavia_von> reminds me of gears of war
[0:45:59] <%ShinobiPhoenix> can you play offline?
[0:46:01] <%ThirdWelles> Oh okay. That sounds like a really good system, actually
[0:46:03] <yourliteraldog> gears level of war-crimes and disdain for the Geneva conventions
[0:46:03] <@SoFarFetched> @StridentSong "it was my brother"
[0:46:03] <LoneFonte> @chiazam nope, you make new characters
[0:46:05] <@ShockzNDrawe> aw sweet
[0:46:05] <%necrocannibal2> you were Paige for a moment there
[0:46:13] <%BoxNavy> i missed a dude get banned? jermaPluto
[0:46:14] <+AlphaRayAllen> "i don't know" - answer one second later
[0:46:14] <+Cerabret100> @ccwettr123 its basically divisiion with sci fi and no flag humping in a way
[0:46:15] <TopTierHarley> You don't have to do co-op
[0:46:20] <xeros720> yeah, this looks pretty fun
[0:46:21] <%ThirdWelles> Scaling based on performance and not just level, so that if you're good enough you can just keep making it harder
[0:46:24] <%Divryne> You also get better loot in coop.
[0:46:25] <@ShockzNDrawe> Well yeah it's BALANCING
[0:46:26] <%dekkitout> Division works like that too with add density
[0:46:30] <%ThirdWelles> That's fucking rad, actually
[0:46:31] <Manwad> oh shit, fuckin' quant goes up, not stats? Hell yeah!
[0:46:31] <Tomschiii> @ccwettr123 div2 is pretty fcking good tho
[0:46:32] <%Pookiedaexzile> Do you have a roll?
[0:46:32] <rufus2k2> this games needs bosses that walk at you slowly

[0:47:41] <$PipIV> hmmmm
[0:47:41] <+TheBitingIrish> OOOOO I wanna see the image!
[0:47:42] <%ThirdWelles> More games need to do this
[0:47:47] <%Teyaric> <3 <3 <3 Goddamnit, Pat, my first thought was Godhand. MAN OF CULTURE.
[0:47:48] <+Shadowofadoubt> das pretty neat
[0:47:49] <+It_sjustjoey> I LOVE it kfgmooBunion
[0:47:50] <+RhaskaFyraska> oh thats neat
[0:47:50] <%Pookiedaexzile> YEYEYEYE
[0:47:55] <+Cerabret100> also you don't have to go up world tier if you don't want, auto advancement can be turned off
[0:47:58] <TopTierHarley> Yup, tier 3 is fucking me right now
[0:47:59] <@SSaryn> Essentially, be gud, get thing
[0:48:03] <fojidoj> That’s very interesting.
[0:48:04] <%Mrbaconator> that's RAD
[0:48:05] <ToneBacas> can you slap butts?
[0:48:05] <%BoxNavy> it goes down if you get your ass kicked
[0:48:11] <Baljhet> That seems like the kind of thing that normally runs in the background. I guess they let you tune it down if you want.
[0:48:12] <TopTierHarley> yea you don't have to advance world tier
[0:48:14] <+Epic_Fubar> hmmm, sounds kinda neat
[0:48:14] <%Pukenasty> does it revert to a lower tier if you die?
[0:48:15] <%anticrust> demonssss soulsss but not bad
[0:48:17] <yourliteraldog> this actually looks like a decent fucking game
[0:48:17] <kingmemelord97> oh i dont like that
[0:48:18] <+EySoyCoco> game gud?
[0:48:24] <BabyNaBackbrace> ohcrap I think I might need this game
[0:48:27] <+Cerabret100> honestly though i never noticed it actually revert
[0:48:29] <%ThirdWelles> That's legitimately incredible and I want more games to use that. Which I imagine would be less impactful in something besides a Shlooter
[0:48:32] <Bigyanno> Good
[0:48:32] <CruxAustralis> no it doesn't
[0:48:34] <@SSaryn> It's Instanced.
[0:48:35] <%Jekado> instance loot
[0:48:38] <%dekkitout> Easy mode is available D:
[0:48:38] <ergulor> and trading?
[0:48:40] <CruxAustralis> I died and it stayed at World 5
[0:48:40] <yourliteraldog> Can't wait till they kill this with agressive montization
[0:48:42] <waywardhavoc> good
[0:48:42] <%vaporousTippler> This looks like a really good Division replacer.
[0:48:44] <cosmicdischarge> no it does;nt
[0:48:46] <%whyskeywolfe> Just don't die psaUp
[0:48:47] <%BoxNavy> this game has promise monkaS
[0:48:47] <fojidoj> Is Squenix developing or are they publishing?
[0:48:47] <+Bupkis7> No it doesn't
[0:48:52] <$Skittlesoul> can you trade loot?
[0:48:54] <%dekkitout> Fuck need/greed systems
[0:48:55] <%depressed_skeleton> is there an easy baby journalist mode? ;.;
[0:48:55] <%necrocannibal2> but I love betraying people
[0:48:56] <Bigyanno> pp
[0:48:56] <+BoBoCatBurger> world tier doesnt lower unless YOU lower it
[0:48:58] <Bigyanno> tp pls
[0:48:59] <$PipIV> hmmm
[0:48:59] <LoneFonte> publishing
[0:49:00] <cosmicdischarge> doesn'* t
[0:49:02] <$RealThiele> gimme those hirunes
[0:49:02] <%GarbageNirvana> This looks neat in ways Division didn't so
[0:49:04] <+Bupkis7> You can manually lower the world tier
[0:49:06] <cosmicdischarge> fck
[0:49:13] <xxshadowxx416> publishing
[0:49:19] <@SSaryn> That's a Heavy Machine Gun alright.
[0:49:19] <CruxAustralis> from the demo this game is worse Gears tbh
[0:49:21] <+Shadowofadoubt> ooooh that's a good sounding gun
[0:49:21] <%bevyrage> that's a super good sounding lmg
[0:49:22] <rufus2k2> damn this game comes out april fools
[0:49:22] <TopTierHarley> yes you can manually lower the tier
[0:49:24] <Shastafield> mmmm rust
[0:49:24] <%vaporousTippler> Honestly, Division needed to be sci fi from the start, so...
[0:49:26] <%Teyaric> Yeah its just The Division. SWEET.
[0:49:28] <%hewlettfan96> What a weird stream hierarchy
[0:49:29] <Bigyanno> pp & tp pls
[0:49:32] <rufus2k2> I remember seeing this ages ago
[0:49:34] <+AlphaRayAllen> DRIP
[0:49:36] <%Jekado> Light Dark tendency
[0:49:40] <$PipIV> need more dakka
[0:49:49] <BabyNaBackbrace> I've been craving Mass Effect 3 multiplayer
[0:49:53] <incredibleCrayon> Whats up shall?
[0:49:54] <CruxAustralis> @Teyaric it's more Gears but boring
[0:49:55] <kingmemelord97> oh thank god that would have runined it for me
[0:49:57] <%hewlettfan96> Thé Division is a masterclass in design
[0:49:57] <+Cerabret100> i want that sweet ass biotech armor the class pages show
[0:49:57] <$PipIV> totally green
[0:50:00] <Manwad> Is loot backloaded in chests, or can mobs drop loot?
[0:50:04] <%anticrust> Is this Squeenix's Shlooter?  @PatStaresAt
[0:50:06] <$RealThiele> yea this is division without ubi-clancy so far
[0:50:06] <%ThirdWelles> Lowering world tier so that you don't have to eat shit like six times when you CO-OP with someone less capable than you sounds nice
[0:50:06] <ExpressNode> Delayed 5
[0:50:07] <@ShockzNDrawe> this sure has that Destiney Character screen
[0:50:10] <%necrocannibal2> @PatStaresAt this game is using Unreal Engine 4 in a way that makes it look EXACTLY like Gears 5, it's making me crazy
[0:50:10] <%cache_22> This is like Portal 2 high fives all over again. LUL
[0:50:13] <Baljhet> mobs can, but it's uncommon
[0:50:13] <@SSaryn> @anticrust Published by, yes.
[0:50:16] <TopTierHarley> I think loot are just in chest
[0:50:16] <KazairLux> but does it have S U N S E T T I N G
[0:50:17] <+Cerabret100> mobs drop loot but chestrs have more
[0:50:20] <%hewlettfan96> Gears of war Isn’t the same since 3
[0:50:28] <+Shadowofadoubt> great aim fellas LUL
[0:50:30] <+Bupkis7> Mobs can drop lute but rarely
[0:50:32] <%depressed_skeleton> am i here?!

[0:52:26] <+Dayube> better too fast than too slow
[0:52:26] <+Stormzcales_Lair> Swtor ish
[0:52:27] <%necrocannibal2> SHEVA
[0:52:29] <%necrocannibal2> COME ON

[0:52:31] <rufus2k2> that's a nice coat
[0:52:33] <hairtoday> SOLD
[0:52:37] <@SSaryn> I'd very much prefer this game to be like.. 75% of the original movement speed.
[0:52:37] <%chiazam> I'd rather a fast run than a slow run thank God
[0:52:39] <+AlphaRayAllen> Oh sweet
[0:52:41] <+mental_mashup> This isn’t gonna be a GAS?
[0:52:42] <%Raymanguy13> Raymanguy13 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months! 
[0:52:48] <rufus2k2> he looks like the villain from I Come in Peace
[0:52:50] <DrkJP520> Jesus, Zangief
[0:52:50] <%ThiccZilla> no squad stream?
[0:52:52] <rufus2k2> wait JEFFREY COMBS?!
[0:52:53] <+BoBoCatBurger> i figured pat and Paige would have done a squad stream
[0:52:54] <incredibleCrayon> Oh cool, this is developed by people can fly? Painkiller was a sick ass game.
[0:52:56] <%dekkitout> Braniac is also bald psaCrazyhand sbfpRichard
[0:52:57] <BabyNaBackbrace> I just flashbacked of Phantom Dust's main area and running around in it
[0:52:58] <+NoGodsNoSenpais> Jeffery Combs!!!

[0:53:04] <%Harthhammer> I wish I had more DS9 to watch
[0:53:06] <%Ranryu692> @PatStaresAt hasn't she met Brunt?
[0:53:07] <Manwad> @Baljhet Does it break down into like, Diablo 3 style loot chunks you can reforge?
[0:53:07] <%whyskeywolfe> GAS makes me fart :(
[0:53:09] <@SSaryn> Pat's class does produce gas though Kappa
[0:53:13] <astrophizz> Brainiac in Injustice 2 also
[0:53:17] <%chiazam> NO GAS!?!?!?
[0:53:19] <%Monkeyweed21> then why is the Coop system better than Destiny?
[0:53:25] <%anticrust> she eyepatch
[0:53:26] <%ThirdWelles> Shlooter that's not a GAS? That's a welcome surprise
[0:53:28] <+Bupkis7> I liked her better in the past
[0:53:29] <%walternatorz> There's a slot open now for another GAS
[0:53:32] <+Shonen_hero> She reminds me of that lady from Black Lagoon
[0:53:32] <TopTierHarley> lol
[0:53:34] <rufus2k2> Jeffrey combs was also the Question in JLU
[0:53:37] <kingmemelord97> title drop
[0:53:40] <Baljhet> @Manwad the stuff I scrapped just turned into...Scrap (currency) but there's rare variants, so better items might get you better cash items
[0:53:42] <+AlphaRayAllen> Kappa
[0:53:45] <rufus2k2> Balalaika
[0:53:49] <%whyskeywolfe> He is powerful in every way except the physical.
[0:53:49] <Tomschiii> I hate how she blames you for putting you into ice sleep
[0:53:50] <%depressed_skeleton> Scream pat
[0:53:52] <%Arancet> we know that doesnt work
[0:53:53] <%Reaviar> i dont like shira cause she critiques you for being in stasis despite being the one to put you in there
[0:53:56] <rufus2k2> or the Russian girl from Pacific Rim
[0:54:03] <RAH001> the dog storing made me thought i was on discord with someone sleep
[0:54:10] <Manwad> @Baljhet Good enough, thanks.
[0:54:10] <yourliteraldog> Only thing I dislike is the dookie color pallet that is obligatory for grim dark sci-fi
[0:54:11] <@Fuggins4U> She-Ra?
[0:54:11] <%anticrust> SHE- RA
[0:54:12] <%whyskeywolfe> She-Ra?
[0:54:13] <%TwoStarPlayersNik> Gief's snores are louder than Pat
[0:54:16] <%ThirdWelles> Hmm
[0:54:22] <kingmemelord97> oh so this is a 4k dead world in a nutshell
[0:54:23] <+Bupkis7> Shira
[0:54:24] <+AlphaRayAllen> Are those game sound effects or is gief snoring again?
[0:54:25] <%depressed_skeleton> @PatStaresAt This is the most realistic Australian game I've seen so far.
[0:54:27] <rufus2k2> Alters?
[0:54:30] <+Shonen_hero> you can do stupid magic shit now
[0:54:30] <rufus2k2> KAZUMA
[0:54:33] <%BoxNavy> youre an altered beast
[0:54:33] <%shurtal> does that make pat an... Altered Boy?

[0:55:40] <%BoxNavy> REMINDER: pat has a bulldog
[0:55:43] <%walternatorz> zangief is growing so strong he now commands the wind
[0:55:44] <TopTierHarley> Do you have to vote to skip cutscenes?
[0:55:47] <leinadtonu> no snoring, just Paige's belly...

[0:55:54] <%ThirdWelles> A big fatty bulldog
[0:55:56] <$RealThiele> theres blue, orange, and fuck you
[0:55:56] <%depressed_skeleton> Pat's character does not look bald, but he's wearing a bald cap.
[0:55:57] <%ThirdWelles> He stinky
[0:55:58] <+Shonen_hero> Pat's character looks like one of Kratos' siblings
[0:56:02] <deviljhojho_> when do they get to outride
[0:56:02] <jorniev> that sounds DIRE
[0:56:05] <%whyskeywolfe> The Orb is absorbed in the narrative
[0:56:05] <LoneFonte> @TopTierHarley ye
[0:56:08] <deviljhojho_> or is is a metaphorical title
[0:56:10] <yourliteraldog> Also this game is literally to dark, let me see those browns

[0:56:25] <+AlphaRayAllen> b0ss

[0:57:44] <@Moobot> Check out Outriders! It seems rad! No seriously look at it https://i.try.games/outriders/reca07
[0:57:49] <+Shonen_hero> which class uses fire based stuff?
[0:57:51] <+TheBitingIrish> Imagine being able to only use 3 out of 8 abilities at a time ResidentSleeper
[0:57:54] <TopTierHarley> Death from Above
[0:57:58] <+matt_mcgrump> Is this a sequel to the Spiders game Technomancer?
[0:58:00] <kingmemelord97> pyro
[0:58:03] <TopTierHarley> Pyromancer @shonen_hero
[0:58:07] <yourliteraldog> @AJ_Cherenkov some people still try to do god's work
[0:58:08] <ZilverZap> balance trynetHappery
[0:58:09] <%Reaviar> @Shonen_hero pyromancer
[0:58:11] <+BoBoCatBurger> @Shonen_hero pyromancer
[0:58:12] <+allups> hows he liking it?
[0:58:14] <sire_nukerre> they're emphasizing "interrupt" type moves
[0:58:26] <+Shonen_hero> thanks guys
[0:58:27] <+AlphaRayAllen> HOW MANY MISSILES I MUST KNOW
[0:58:31] <TopTierHarley> interrupt is important
[0:58:31] <yourliteraldog> FUCKING DOPE
[0:58:34] <$RealThiele> John romero's PAIN LAUNCHER
[0:58:36] <+Shonen_hero> is there an air based class?
[0:58:38] <%ThirdWelles> Do you choose class AND element separately?
[0:58:38] <$PipIV> draws aggro. so gud
[0:58:40] <Harilds> sidequest!
[0:58:42] <ZilverZap> About tree fiddy missles
[0:58:45] <sire_nukerre> it looks dope
[0:58:45] <+allups> also has anyone got into a public game
[0:58:46] <syanplague> Are you really the healer?
[0:58:46] <%cache_22> Ew
[0:58:48] <%Pookiedaexzile> Imma say it if no one else will
[0:58:49] <Oxybe> Interrupt is super good
[0:58:52] <%Piemen99> disgusting
[0:58:53] <Baljhet> class and element are the same pick, unfortunately
[0:58:58] <blink289> Just hopped in does the game look good?
[0:58:58] <%Tenchi_G> hehehe
[0:59:02] <%Pookiedaexzile> I want my dick to be called the pain lancher
[0:59:10] <LoneFonte> @Shonen_hero no
[0:59:13] <rufus2k2> so this is what anthem would have been if it was developed for more than 2 months
[0:59:14] <%dekkitout> Ooo I like dat
[0:59:14] <ZilverZap> you can still get other elements from weapons tho
[0:59:14] <%AJ_Cherenkov> @yourliteraldog No, I mean every single bit of UI and mechanics being discussed looks like it's from GAS. If it isn't now, I would bet money it was supposed to be earlier in development.
[0:59:14] <$PipIV> suck it down
[0:59:15] <%Reaviar> @Shonen_hero no, its technomancer, pyromancer, devastator which is earth, and trickster which is time
[0:59:21] <ZilverZap> Like burning damage from a weapon
[0:59:30] <TopTierHarley> Trickster is what I play
[0:59:30] <sire_nukerre> skill tags are always important
[0:59:40] <%mield916> but new store pat
[0:59:45] <$Skittlesoul> is there a money link
[0:59:45] <TopTierHarley> is so fun
[0:59:49] <TopTierHarley> it's*
[0:59:53] <%depressed_skeleton> i'm skeleton
[0:59:58] <TopTierHarley> once I opened the skill tree it was over
[1:00:01] <ZilverZap> I heard legendary weapons are a thing in the demo but I haven't got one to drop yet
[1:00:03] <rufus2k2> awww gear doesn't show up in Cutscenes :(
[1:00:04] <+Shonen_hero> okay so not quite classical elements based classes
[1:00:11] <rufus2k2> i wanna look like that!
[1:00:16] <%anticrust> SHE-RA
[1:00:16] <rufus2k2> Future STALKER
[1:00:19] <+RyGuy182> is that a snoring dog i hear?
[1:00:20] <echobee_tv> Anyone tell Paige that Trickster turns people into skeletons?
[1:00:25] <@ShockzNDrawe> "I hope she die- I hope she shows up" - Pat
[1:00:27] <rufus2k2> but...BUT I LIKE MY HELMET
[1:00:28] <%dekkitout> Dammit, lemme keep my helmet on
[1:00:32] <%dekkitout> It is the way
[1:00:35] <+allups> helmet off anyway
[1:00:43] <yourliteraldog> thats good
[1:00:50] <%Reaviar> my favorite ability is trickster's "nothing personal, kid."
[1:00:50] <%BoxNavy> mudpoo man
[1:00:51] <+alternative_flu> I just played this demo
[1:00:54] <sire_nukerre> crap I missed it
[1:00:55] <yourliteraldog> dookie armor
[1:00:56] <%depressed_skeleton> stinky
[1:00:57] <+Mutanthunter> I like cool helmets in cutscenes
[1:00:58] <%dekkitout> Its clobberin time!
[1:00:59] <%rytisone> Paige is the Thing
[1:01:00] <ZilverZap> So Paige is an earthbender?
[1:01:01] <LoneFonte> Oh yeah, effects look REALLY cool in this game
[1:01:01] <%BoxNavy> become rocks
[1:01:03] <sire_nukerre> become poo
[1:01:04] <%Pookiedaexzile> Lets just cover up all the facial animation we spent money on
[1:01:06] <%Mrbaconator> it makes you stinky
[1:01:08] <@PlagueOfGripes> I went Trickster
[1:01:09] <sire_nukerre> wtf
[1:01:09] <yourliteraldog> Braps with thrust

[1:01:57] <ToneBacas> pat like gun
[1:01:58] <ScreamLord> Just a R.Y.N.O 1
[1:01:59] <Manwad> SUMMON: GUN
[1:01:59] <%ThirdWelles> Are power Element and Class separate choices? Or is ice tied to Technomancer?
[1:01:59] <yourliteraldog> Gat-mancer
[1:01:59] <%dekkitout> Gungician- I like that
[1:02:00] <TopTierHarley> Technomancer
[1:02:00] <Saltmeisterr> BULLETMANCY
[1:02:02] <sire_nukerre> that is fucking cool as fuck
[1:02:02] <Oxybe> Technomancer
[1:02:03] <Torgue_1> How many classes are there?
[1:02:04] <%depressed_skeleton> Gunmancer
[1:02:05] <%Arancet> shoot wizard
[1:02:05] <ZilverZap> we're all gungicians
[1:02:05] <%Reaviar> pyromancer turns people into bombs tho
[1:02:05] <ExpressNode> Gungician
[1:02:06] <%EcchiRider> Do they have their own setups now?
[1:02:06] <$PipIV> "I C E"
[1:02:06] <%whyskeywolfe> The outlandish abilities are a little at-odds with the brown-grey aesthetic.
[1:02:07] <+RyGuy182> pewpewmancer
[1:02:08] <LoneFonte> @Cobaltor_252 Technomancer

[1:02:20] <ShichiNoBushi> Remember Gun Mage? From FFX-2?
[1:02:21] <$PipIV> GUNGEONEER
[1:02:22] <%ThirdWelles> roger
[1:02:22] <jorniev> GUNNOMANCY
[1:02:23] <%depressed_skeleton> This really looks like Australia
[1:02:25] <LoneFonte> @ThirdWelles Tied to class
[1:02:27] <ZilverZap> Lets me show you a magic trick: GUN
[1:02:27] <+BoBoCatBurger> @ThirdWelles ice is tied to thecno
[1:02:31] <ToneBacas> I choose you, GUN
[1:02:34] <%coward_man> the Trickster class has Dio style timestop
[1:02:35] <$RealThiele> or not
[1:02:35] <%Emperor_Machinus> absolved
[1:02:36] <atteroproxy> I feel like I'm watching the full version of the streamer clipshow they make a trailer out of lol
[1:02:40] <%vaporousTippler> I like Warglock
[1:02:40] <%Mrbaconator> Guncerer
[1:02:44] <bekas01> I cast GUN
[1:02:51] <%Mrbaconator> WARGLOCK IS STRONG
[1:02:57] <ZilverZap> I appreciate how tough most of the levels are
[1:02:58] <%Monkeyweed21> now I'm just imagining Glock Trance like FF14
[1:02:58] <KaironFortressKnight> Warglock is fucking strong
[1:03:02] <Oxybe> Warglock is a good one @vaporousTippler
[1:03:03] <BabyNaBackbrace> Firearmancer?
[1:03:05] <yourliteraldog> I bet this game had a cool art style in the concept phase. Like this game is missing crust punks
[1:03:10] <%Jungos60> Warglock sounds Bad ass!!
[1:03:12] <Parapattern> God all these chest high walls
[1:03:16] <%ThirdWelles> Does Paige *still* need to go to the eye doctor? Or just get more glasses after losing all of them?
[1:03:19] <+Shonen_hero> this looks like it plays real well
[1:03:21] <%Pookiedaexzile> Try to wall bounce
[1:03:23] <%Ipsenscastle> Who said WARGLOCK that's genius
[1:03:26] <+Shonen_hero> setting seems a bit generic though
[1:03:27] <%toastybites> is this warframe with people
[1:03:34] <%walternatorz> have pat and paige survived their betrothal so far?
[1:03:38] <yourliteraldog> WARGLOCK is good
[1:03:38] <TopTierHarley> Shotguns in this game feel good
[1:03:40] <%ThirdWelles> Warglock is incredible
[1:03:45] <rufus2k2> damn the enemies look cool
[1:03:49] <%Emperor_Machinus> This reminds of borderlands
[1:03:50] <rufus2k2> I want those maks
[1:03:52] <rufus2k2> masks
[1:03:56] <ZilverZap> if you run and melee you get an aoe melee attack @PatStaresAt
[1:03:56] <%cache_22> "Melt" = explode into chunks
[1:03:58] <yourliteraldog> chonky
[1:04:00] <+Shonen_hero> wow
[1:04:06] <KaironFortressKnight> Its a goddamn shame that Pat has yet to see the term Warglock
[1:04:13] <Oxybe> chunky salsa
[1:04:23] <%vaporousTippler> It's almost like he's playing a game.
[1:04:39] <KaironFortressKnight> Pat doesnt play games
[1:04:42] <KaironFortressKnight> He stares at them
[1:04:43] <TopTierHarley> Can you refund the turret @patstaresat
[1:04:44] <KaironFortressKnight> :D
[1:04:45] <@Moobot> Check out Outriders! It seems rad! No seriously look at it https://i.try.games/outriders/reca07
[1:04:53] <Oxybe> we do need to push Warglock for SummerSlam.
[1:05:00] <%whyskeywolfe> [Little Bits]
[1:05:07] <Saltmeisterr> Warglock is very gud
[1:05:11] <kingmemelord97> hey chat is this by the same devs that made remnant ?
[1:05:17] <ScreamLord> WTF bullshit word was that?
[1:05:20] <%ThirdWelles> I'd die for Warglock
[1:05:24] <+allups> yeah i dont like the cover system really
[1:05:30] <%Pookiedaexzile> That's high level gears ,but better
[1:05:33] <+RhaskaFyraska> @kingmemelord97 no its the same devs as bulletstorm
[1:05:46] <kingmemelord97> oh sweet
[1:05:53] <%Reaviar> cover is to take a quick pause then get moving or the game makes fun of you
[1:05:54] <Too_Much_Nukie> Looks like you fucking jobbed.
[1:06:08] <%ThirdWelles> Altered, I'm sure
[1:06:08] <rufus2k2> 3rd person GoW RPG huh?
[1:06:36] <$PipIV> we're in the future but still using S10's?
[1:06:39] <ZilverZap> She's speaking pretty calmly for someone that's bleeding pretty heavily
[1:06:41] <%solracc25> solracc25 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! Congratulations for the engagement.
[1:06:43] <%Pookiedaexzile> Its the thing people who like Gears have been asking for, plus powers
[1:06:59] <ShichiNoBushi> I like how they indicate the plot progressing dialog and the extra dialog like in Cyberpunk.
[1:07:03] <+MajorCrasher> I don't get the gears comparison tbh. this seems like a very different types of tps
[1:07:05] <Dat_Abaddon> They sound like some Ubisoft E3 trailer for some Multiplayer game
[1:07:13] <yourliteraldog> war crimes
[1:07:19] <yourliteraldog> for the children
[1:07:22] <Zombrocom> This reminds me of the division
[1:07:30] <LoneFonte> yep LUL
[1:07:39] <+Cerabret100> The pyromancer needs either better gear, or better support than the demo allows
[1:07:42] <ZilverZap> Synced dodges
[1:07:49] <rufus2k2> and it shows blast radius cool
[1:07:49] <%dekkitout> "Parry this motherfucker! *Pulls out rocket launcher* "
[1:07:52] <Shastafield> we havent had a good tps in a while
[1:07:57] <%ThirdWelles> Can you aim it by point the camera? It looked like it went laterally in the preview vid?
[1:07:59] <%BigDumBeak> the cover is more for them than you i guess
[1:08:04] <yourliteraldog> looks like the roll gives you I frames
[1:08:04] <%ThirdWelles> pointing*
[1:08:09] <$RealThiele> kobe
[1:08:11] <yourliteraldog> roll like sanic
[1:08:14] <%toastybites> they gotta tone down the damage redness
[1:08:14] <Oxybe> Cryo doing the work and taking the shots.
[1:08:22] <DrkJP520> CoD veteran mode grenade flashbacks
[1:08:32] <%TheWinged7> paaatug you shouldt be hitting on anyone anymore, your engaged :P
[1:08:48] <$PipIV> speaking or Division, what are we? what is a outrider? are we a magic merc? are we a witcher?
[1:08:49] <pavramz> ok this might be a day one purchase for me
[1:09:05] <xbb1024> is it possible to solo this game?
[1:09:05] <ZilverZap> Z O O P
[1:09:19] <%Aeoneth> @PipIV we're basically whatever Rider was in Mass Effect Andromeda
[1:09:20] <+toastybites> @PipIV like a gunmancer or something
[1:09:25] <Manwad> I love that you're against hordes, and you have an active regen mechanic
[1:09:28] <%ThirdWelles> @xbb1024 It scales for solo and Co-op, yeah
[1:09:29] <Baljhet> you were a frontline soldier who got cryslept into the post-apocalypse and now you have superpowers.
[1:09:37] <cosmicdischarge> it is singleplayer co op so yes @PatStaresAt
[1:09:43] <yourliteraldog> dose the pain launcher auto lock targets or is it a line attack
[1:09:44] <%ThirdWelles> @toastybites We've decided on Warglock
[1:09:51] <$PipIV> ok
[1:09:52] <%Aeoneth> tbf it was after getting hit by basicall space radiation
[1:10:04] <ZilverZap> The biggest proponent of Gun-fu
[1:10:12] <Ravioli_Ronin> So just how poggers is this game?
[1:10:24] <%ThirdWelles> Seems pretty poggers
[1:10:28] <%cache_22> #gamefeel
[1:10:31] <Parapattern> Pat is just Cold Miser
[1:10:34] <ExpressNode> Yeah the shoot bangs feel nice
[1:10:36] <+MajorCrasher> SHILL
[1:10:37] <chromonaut747> thats people can fly for ya
[1:10:39] <+gruff_gridof> evoShill evoShill evoShill
[1:10:39] <%Ranryu692> I can't play the demo, I'm watching you stream
[1:10:43] <+Cerabret100> the cover feels a little clunky like hitting space doesn't always work, but for the most part it feels nice
[1:10:43] <+RhaskaFyraska> yeah i saw people ragging on this game but it looks grat
[1:10:44] <%ThirdWelles> Free demo gets me rowdy
[1:10:46] <%thbluewarden> but dont take my word for it...
[1:10:52] <+pieking83> is this on pc too?
[1:10:53] <%BoxNavy> !outriders
[1:10:53] <ToneBacas> like Mutant Year Zero
[1:10:53] <DrkJP520> gom a free demo?
[1:10:53] <@Moobot> Check out Outriders! It seems rad! No seriously look at it https://i.try.games/outriders/reca07

[1:10:56] <super_robo_mg> Does he care for hunky boys?
[1:10:56] <%JumboCrunchies> Like Gorman Freeman?
[1:10:56] <chromonaut747> they did bulletstorm which is a underrated but good shooty game
[1:10:58] <ScreamLord> He's a goreman being
[1:10:58] <ToneBacas> Bormin
[1:10:59] <+SaltySombrero> Goreman Freeman
[1:10:59] <%Pookiedaexzile> Crazy Ball
[1:11:00] <ZilverZap> Just play the demo and decide for yourself
[1:11:01] <%Aeoneth> Gorman Freenan
[1:11:02] <+Bael_Lord_of_End> Game reminds me of Destiny & The Division
[1:11:04] <%necrocannibal2> how stick is the cover in this game
[1:11:05] <$RealThiele> his brown pants
[1:11:07] <rufus2k2> @pieking83 yup, steam demo is up

[1:11:28] <%Pookiedaexzile> Does this Goreman also like Hunky Boys
[1:11:32] <Alezial95> Freedon Gorman
[1:11:33] <+pieking83> nice
[1:11:34] <%croxeye> It's too bad you can't disable the bad motion blur :(
[1:11:34] <Esperflame> Been playing this game but the multiplayer seems sketchy
[1:11:37] <Baljhet> you have to look at cover and press a button to hit it; you can back up or dodge-roll to cancel. it's hard to accidentally cover
[1:11:40] <+pieking83> gotta try it
[1:11:41] <%dekkitout> "I cast GUN"
[1:11:47] <%JoshManVGH> Speaking of spells!
[1:11:47] <@Moobot> Check out Outriders! It seems rad! No seriously look at it https://i.try.games/outriders/reca07
[1:11:51] <%ThirdWelles> Oh fuck
[1:11:55] <ExpressNode> Shot him in the ass
[1:11:58] <%ThirdWelles> Okay, so just FFXIV
[1:12:13] <Ravioli_Ronin> This might be a dumb question, but is this in any way kind of like ME3 multiplayer? Cause that’s the vibe I’m kind of getting
[1:12:26] <jellssssss20> Lol that link doesn't work?
[1:12:29] <%ThirdWelles> It's CO-OP campaign
[1:12:37] <%JoshManVGH> I feel more like a Space Wizard in 5 minutes of getting my first ability, than I did after HOURS of playing "The Bad Game!"
[1:12:41] <ZilverZap> It does feel a bit ME3 co-op
[1:12:46] <%ThirdWelles> Fully campaign, I mean
[1:12:49] <+BoBoCatBurger> @croxeye if youre on ps you can disable it throught a text file
[1:12:54] <ExpressNode> Yeah that link doesn't work
[1:12:55] <$PipIV> that's a lotta rust
[1:13:02] <%ThirdWelles> ME3 co-op was just Firefight, wasn't it?
[1:13:29] <skyentombment> putting in a skub?
[1:13:33] <Ravioli_Ronin> Yeah, just 4(?) player firefight
[1:13:36] <ZilverZap> boss time
[1:13:40] <%necrocannibal2> @PatStaresAt is the cover sticky like Gears or soft like Uncharted
[1:13:42] <skyentombment> excuse you pat, I am anti skub
[1:13:47] <+walternatorz> how midwestern is Paige?

[1:21:22] <ergulor> did pat caused her loot to be lost?
[1:21:25] <Oxybe> It's hard to play the victim card after what he did to Mainguy McDuderson in the intro
[1:21:27] <+TheBitingIrish> No good guys in this story

[1:22:23] <Reanimator83> Once you talk to her Paige might get an item
[1:22:24] <%rumtumtugnutz> I feel like in this game that the city is gonna heel turn and you're going to join the insurgents
[1:22:33] <NireFuster> what did Paige mean by ALL her water bottles? how many does she have in her room?
[1:22:36] <%Archphronimos> SHE WAS IN THE MAP MENU

[1:25:36] <Escherite> I think you can sell guns and in the full version you can pull mods off of guns and slap them on other guns
[1:25:37] <+Cerabret100> @cache_22 you can dismantle from menu, think you can sell to stores too but either way you get cash

[1:26:56] <Reanimator83> The game play is like The Division. The UI is like Destiny
[1:26:59] <@SSaryn> And now he's dead.

[1:27:47] <%vaporousTippler> Today's just another bad day.
[1:27:48] <NireFuster> Why does Pat's game look different than Paige's? Do you guys have different graphic settings?

[1:27:53] <Oxybe> Did you talk to the lady with the vynal records?
[1:27:56] <MayorRev> this is hilarious
[1:28:00] <%rumtumtugnutz> Your character is not attractive enough to be morally grey, so you must be evil
[1:28:01] <$SGrim> !raffle Pat's giving away beta access keys PogChamp
[1:28:07] <MayorRev> Death is just an inconvenience here
[1:28:10] <%Pookiedaexzile> OOOOOH
[1:28:13] <jorniev> CRUEL UNIVERSE THY GRIMDARKNESS IS LUDICROUS
[1:28:16] <JustYudha> SHILL TIME
[1:28:20] <rasseabreeze> This game is so weird, I've never seen a game introducing so many different characters only to kill them off in the next scene
[1:28:21] <%Pookiedaexzile> he's on a bad pc
[1:28:21] <%Nope80808> Oh thats coolk
[1:28:29] <%Pookiedaexzile> Games great tho
[1:28:29] <NireFuster> Oh hey that's actually pretty cool! Nice
[1:28:32] <ExpressNode> Does the PS5 run this at 4K?
[1:28:34] <Ravioli_Ronin> noted warlord Bob Barker
[1:28:35] <+TheBitingIrish> Fucking RIP Xbox this gen LUL
[1:28:37] <JustYudha> Cross play is pretty cool tho
[1:28:58] <Vyskus> cross play should be default but I appreciate it all the same
[1:29:01] <%Ranryu692> is there any cool controller stuff?
[1:29:02] <+Shonen_hero> I'm really not sure how I feel about the game's tone
[1:29:03] <Ravioli_Ronin> Xbox One SSX Tricky
[1:29:05] <+Houndemise> does this game have cross saving across all platforms too?
[1:29:05] <+Shonen_hero> the gameplay is fun
[1:29:08] <%CapnClassix> psaDogchamp *snore* psaDogchamp
[1:29:09] <Oxybe> Heck yeah it's a bad day. Y'all couldn't get some tea from the nice old shop guy.
[1:29:16] <MayorRev> fortnite
[1:29:18] <+Shonen_hero> but the main characters seem morally bankrupt
[1:29:20] <%Pookiedaexzile> Cross play is a good plus. The PC master Race can gloat in real time
[1:29:26] <%GarbageNirvana> So anyway I started blastin
[1:29:28] <%CatastropheCorvid> Wait, they're both streaming?  Excuse me as my PC struggles and groans to process both streams at once.
[1:29:30] <Vyskus> so anyway I started blasting
[1:29:32] <%Deft_Thought> I'm surprised Pat didn't go big stronk Rock Man class
[1:29:36] <%coward_man> this game really does scratch the Destiny itch
[1:29:36] <Ravioli_Ronin> Fuck I thought that was one of my dogs for a second
[1:29:39] <Vyskus> jinx
[1:29:39] <%rumtumtugnutz> fuck' em Boivin, fuck 'em up! OOF OOF
[1:29:39] <ZilverZap> sidearms seem to be pretty useless
[1:30:04] <%Pookiedaexzile> @CatastropheCorvid Yeah they are  Paiges
[1:30:05] <super_robo_mg> WOOF
[1:30:08] <rasseabreeze> sidearms can also have buffs like your main weapons @ZilverZap so they can be quite stronk
[1:30:12] <%coward_man> Trickster is also super dope, it has a Dio style time stop
[1:30:16] <MayorRev> Pat were you about to say Devastator?
[1:30:25] <MayorRev> like the duke 3d gun?
[1:30:30] <%rumtumtugnutz> I don't know why anyone would ever use the stock sidearm cause it is measurably worse than just eating some damage and meelee'in fools
[1:30:33] <%Pookiedaexzile> Would you say the shotty leaves alot of GNASHES
[1:30:38] <+abrupt_abe> WOOF
[1:30:40] <%Divryne> WOOF.
[1:30:43] <ExpressNode> I love it
[1:30:49] <+Solutha> why is the wall bleeding
[1:30:51] <%cache_22> I like how the graffiti in the Hounds area is just "WOOF".
[1:30:51] <+abrupt_abe> Reminds me of Gears of War blood
[1:31:00] <+number1ichiban> Is this like third-person Borderlands or something more akin to Destiny?
[1:31:06] <%TubeMan642> After playing this game I can say it really feels like Destiny and The Division combined
[1:31:06] <Ravioli_Ronin> WOOF
[1:31:07] <%M4T1A5> feels like it's directly from Bulletstorm
[1:31:09] <jorniev> SNORE DOG
[1:31:12] <%Monkeyweed21> It IS the Bulletstorm devs
[1:31:23] <Saltmeisterr> ^
[1:31:25] <Vyskus> oh pat is throwing a turret, I straight up thought he just sucked with grenades
[1:31:35] <@SSaryn> @Monkeyweed21 It is indeed the Bulletstorm devs.
[1:31:51] <LoneFonte> Double Gun?
[1:31:52] <+Shonen_hero> Is Bulletstorm good?
[1:31:53] <%BogBodyPositive> @Vyskus ikr??? me too
[1:31:59] <%cache_22> Can you trade items or are they just per-player?
[1:32:06] <%rumtumtugnutz> The levels so far are way smaller than Destiny.... Game feels way more like Borderlands with the kinda loose shooting?
[1:32:07] <+abrupt_abe> FF14
[1:32:12] <Saltmeisterr> what about in ff14?
[1:32:13] <LoneFonte> per-player
[1:32:13] <%BubbaRands> psaDogchamp him snor
[1:32:13] <%Deft_Thought> @Shonen_hero Yeah, kinda
[1:32:14] <cosmicdischarge> it is really fun @Shonen_hero
[1:32:17] <+PenmanLupine> like irl
[1:32:30] <CeJaxon> @Shonen_hero if anything bulletstorm was fun
[1:32:30] <%rumtumtugnutz> @Shonen_hero It has interesting ideas, but I don't care for Bulletstorm
[1:32:35] <%BogBodyPositive> Pat has a helmet kink confirmed
[1:32:44] <jorniev> WOW GIEF IS SNORING
[1:32:46] <Slimshazbot> "I hate seeing my character's face" says man that always makes himself. There's something to unpack there I think.
[1:32:50] <zerointelligence000> is the loot locked to certain classes?
[1:32:50] <@Moobot> Check out Outriders! It seems rad! No seriously look at it https://i.try.games/outriders/reca07
[1:32:51] <Oxybe> Helmets are dope tho
[1:32:51] <%rumtumtugnutz> Pat Likes Hats
[1:32:54] <Ravioli_Ronin> Was that an Emil spooky visor skull?
[1:33:00] <T_Sasquatch> This game is the most 7/10 game I've ever seen
[1:33:01] <%coward_man> I played like 4 hours and wasn't done
[1:33:03] <+marlborored5> liked the game, shame it costs FUCKING 300 BUCKS IN MY COUNTRY
[1:33:08] <@SSaryn> You most likely will. I'd be very surprised if you don't.
[1:33:08] <%Pookiedaexzile> No the shooting is tight. as hell. Bulletstorm, and gears allumni
[1:33:31] <allanmiri> Ah the old 'trick you into thinking it's a cutscnene trick' good one game.
[1:33:32] <+ReallyBigRocks> This sure is a lootems shootems. You enjoying it Pat?
[1:33:33] <+Shonen_hero> choo choo rocket
[1:33:36] <super_robo_mg> that's what she said!
[1:33:38] <%lumporr> @marlborored5 wait what? how
[1:33:38] <%Deft_Thought> The VA in this game is rough and the humor is "Lol edgy." The game itself seems aight.. I'm surprised that the particle effects aren't eye searing.
[1:33:39] <%king_wragles> @PatStaresAt she shoots at your turret everytime you summon it in front of her
[1:33:39] <Saltmeisterr> @marlborored5 wtf man that sucks
[1:33:44] <T_Sasquatch> @pookiedaexzile tight ?? Its serviceable but division is way better
[1:34:00] <s1rcuit> ey, I picked the same class
[1:34:11] <Oxybe> turret is putting in the work man
[1:34:12] <%Reaviar> can we just refer to pat's turrets as gief and elmo
[1:34:12] <allanmiri> It did it's job.
[1:34:19] <+Shonen_hero> 300 dollars? That's crazy
[1:34:26] <Vyskus> if we're still comparing to destiny I'm glad this game has the balls to commit to 3rd person
[1:34:28] <%Deft_Thought> You can't turn yourself into a rock and throw yourself at people in the Division tho
[1:34:31] <%Monkeyweed21> Pat turrets are doing more than Paige
[1:34:47] <%Deft_Thought> It reminds me more of Remnant: From the Ashes
[1:34:53] <stevenellis386> I really hope this game's story is good.
[1:35:03] <s1rcuit> it's advertised as a mine but it works just as well as a grenade
[1:35:09] <%Deft_Thought> @stevenellis386 LUL
[1:35:17] <T_Sasquatch> Also does anyone know the real answer to if this is a live service game ?
[1:35:24] <%ClericOfSparda> LUL
[1:35:25] <CeJaxon> @Vyskus same, im happy to see my character do cool shit in 3rd person
[1:35:30] <%Deft_Thought> @T_Sasquatch It isn't.
[1:35:41] <Vyskus> the graffiti is cool
[1:35:45] <%lumporr> wait what is the point of this game
[1:35:49] <allanmiri> LOOOT!
[1:35:51] <%lumporr> like what's different about it at all
[1:35:51] <+marlborored5> @lumporr @Saltmeisterr perks of living in a place where the dollar is five times your currency, also, no it's not like you make five times as much to count against it
[1:35:52] <ZilverZap> I wish there is transmog in htis game
[1:35:53] <jorniev> can you shoot their granades?
[1:36:00] <%Deft_Thought> The plan for the devs is to release expansions but no live service stuff
[1:36:10] <%lumporr> @marlborored5 jesus where's that
[1:36:14] <%MyNameisTiff_> MyNameisTiff_ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 21 months! 
[1:36:14] <T_Sasquatch> @deft_thought i swear it seemed like one from all the advertising.  It has destiny UI LUL
[1:36:24] <allanmiri> @Deft_Thought I hope it stays like that.
[1:36:25] <Too_Much_Nukie> It probably dealt like 3.5 before in the code.
[1:36:27] <super_robo_mg> 4 + 2 = 5
[1:36:33] <%ClericOfSparda> What did Paige get?
[1:36:33] <Saltmeisterr> @marlborored5 lemme guess, brazil?
[1:36:33] <+ReallyBigRocks> Must be some decimal rounding shenanigans
[1:36:41] <%Monkeyweed21> yea this is Bulletstorm Diablo
[1:36:43] <+marlborored5> @marlborored5 that my friend, is south america
[1:36:44] <stevenellis386> @Deft_Thought that's the only deal breaker for me. I have yet to try the demo.
[1:36:46] <Vyskus> @cejaxon destiny constantly zooming in and out of 3rd person actually makes me wanna hurl
[1:36:52] <%Deft_Thought> Oh for sure, dude(s). I think its going for the same crowd as Remnant
[1:36:54] <rasseabreeze> Pat, you're a TECHNOMANCER
[1:36:56] <s1rcuit> Paige the tank?
[1:37:01] <%lumporr> Raarrr!!
[1:37:06] <@SSaryn> Who likes motion blur and shaky cam Kappa
[1:37:10] <GarrisonPrime> The CC is off in this scene
[1:37:23] <%TEANTACLES> the subs are way too fast
[1:37:25] <NireFuster> King dragon sends his regards
[1:37:26] <%Nope80808> What the fuck is this tone
[1:37:27] <Saltmeisterr> wtf is going on with the subtilrs?
[1:37:27] <T_Sasquatch> Tone shift is wild
[1:37:28] <%EternalJedi> limesLUL
[1:37:28] <%chiazam> LMAOOOO
[1:37:28] <%Pookiedaexzile> the Girl voice actor is better
[1:37:31] <%Jekado> its trying to be borderlands
[1:37:32] <%lumporr> huh
[1:37:34] <allanmiri> Your character is such a dork! I love it!
[1:37:37] <%caramelatte1> Its neat
[1:37:38] <Reanimator83> Sell all that low gear. The vendors should have way better stuff
[1:37:38] <Shastafield> he goes with it
[1:37:38] <jorniev> THATS GREAT
[1:37:38] <CeJaxon> i need them to get rid of the shaky came its so bad
[1:37:38] <%GarbageNirvana> Kinda like Bulletstorm
[1:37:38] <%cache_22> So like Doom Guy?
[1:37:38] <%Reaviar> i mean your character is also pretty much a god
[1:37:39] <rasseabreeze> Its like Borderlands mixed with Gears of War in a Mass Effect setting
[1:37:41] <Khester824> the protagonist is fucking insane
[1:37:42] <%Pookiedaexzile> Just straight up its not even close
[1:37:43] <%EternalJedi> yeah the subtitles in this bit specifically is screwed up
[1:37:47] <penitentpendant> It's like Warhammer 40k, you go so Grimdark you loop back into hilarious
[1:37:49] <%GarbageNirvana> Which People Can Fly also made I think?
[1:37:50] <Shastafield> he acts like hes in a video game
[1:37:56] <%goose_attack_almanac> He sounds like a bored, toned down Duke Nukem.
[1:37:58] <Saltmeisterr> YOU'LL KILL MY DICK?
[1:37:58] <hairtoday> you did a good thing x2
[1:37:59] <Ravioli_Ronin> It’s not slapstick enough to work
[1:37:59] <%Deft_Thought> @stevenellis386 Game feel seems all right but the storyline is like gritty Borderlands. The VA is awkward as hell, the cutscenes are framed super weird--I don't imagine the story will be anything worth keeping up with.
[1:37:59] <%Ranryu692> Bulletstorm was fun
[1:37:59] <%Nope80808> pooooo
[1:38:00] <%TEANTACLES> this is nowhere near as cool as bulletstorm
[1:38:01] <%Mrbaconator> is it just me or are the subtitles ahead of the dialogue being spoken
[1:38:02] <s1rcuit> I forgot they did BulletStorm
[1:38:03] <+marlborored5> also the subtitles are REALLY bothering me
[1:38:04] <%Nope80808> ohhh*
[1:38:04] <%CapnClassix> Love how they keep reassuring you that you're the GOOD GUY
[1:38:07] <%Piemen99> would you care about people if you have god powers
[1:38:09] <%Divryne> @patstaresat It’s Bulletstorm humor.
[1:38:09] <%lumporr> @penitentpendant i think wh40k is just grimdark *and* hilarious
[1:38:10] <%chiazam> OH NO WONDER
[1:38:10] <xbb1024> Everyone reminding you that you did a good thing
[1:38:11] <T_Sasquatch> Like you wake up from cryo , and get over it realllyy quickly
[1:38:17] <super_robo_mg> how good is the character customization?
[1:38:18] <%JoshManVGH> It's Jack Burton
[1:38:19] <%Mrbaconator> ah ok
[1:38:20] <%chiazam> Bulletstorm was great
[1:38:20] <allanmiri> They got time to fix it.
[1:38:21] <%EternalJedi> marlborored5 at least form what I've seen in the demo it's just that scene
[1:38:21] <+scottmou> I love you pat
[1:38:39] <%walternatorz> "fucky wucky" is that verbatim?
[1:38:46] <+abrupt_abe> Smart
[1:38:50] <%cache_22> Official Square Enix PR: "The subtitles are a little fucky wucky." psaWhat
[1:38:55] <%Deft_Thought> @stevenellis386 That being said, the game plays all right. A little janky on the PC and very particle heavy so it can choke out mid range processors. But it seems aight if this style of game is something you like
[1:38:56] <allanmiri> The game looks better than most shlooter games I've seen.
[1:38:57] <%Piemen99> oooooh
[1:38:57] <%M4T1A5> Isn't that just a destiny
[1:38:57] <%chiazam> Ohhhhhhh
[1:39:00] <Reanimator83> Sell that stuff
[1:39:01] <Vyskus> uwu I made wittle fucky wucky uwu
[1:39:02] <%rytisone> that's neat
[1:39:07] <%Nope80808> This game sure is brown.
[1:39:11] <bear_breaker20> big fan of fucky wucky tonight
[1:39:13] <p0tat0ch1p5> would you also be able to sell those marked items all at once?
[1:39:18] <%lumporr> ohh, they did a widdwe fucky wucky?
[1:39:21] <%goose_attack_almanac> Cub Scouts honour?
[1:39:28] <LoneFonte> @p0tat0ch1p5 ye
[1:39:29] <%GarbageNirvana> I mean considering every shlooter out there is a bit fucked lately this looks at least inoffensive
[1:39:29] <allanmiri> A little fucky wucky. Oopsie woopsie
[1:39:36] <%chiazam> Pat you weren't a Scout
[1:39:39] <%TEANTACLES> it's just an iron man helmet pat
[1:39:51] <%BogBodyPositive> Helmet Knink! told ya
[1:39:52] <@Moobot> Check out Outriders! It seems rad! No seriously look at it https://i.try.games/outriders/reca07
[1:39:58] <allanmiri> I'm blue dabadedada
[1:40:08] <@SSaryn> psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp
[1:40:12] <+ReallyBigRocks> This game really doesn't look that brown, I feel like you're forgetting just how brown every game used to be
[1:40:16] <allanmiri> Oh wow he big!
[1:40:17] <%TEANTACLES> oh my god zangief is so big now
[1:40:19] <Bigyanno> At what point does puppy stop being puppy and become doggo?
[1:40:26] <allanmiri> BIG PUP!
[1:40:27] <Oxybe> DOG STREAM! DOG STREAM! DOG STREAM!
[1:40:31] <%BogBodyPositive> psaDogchamp
[1:40:33] <%coward_man> we can now pinpoint where Gief is by listening to audio from each stream
[1:40:34] <PleaseCallMeSugar> how is he so BIG now
[1:40:37] <%Pookiedaexzile> Damn dat boy large
[1:40:40] <Vyskus> I do wish the characters were slightly more colorful
[1:40:45] <+marlborored5> he became a CHONKER really fast huh
[1:40:50] <Srthunda> thats blue
[1:40:52] <%justcallmebobplease> @Bigyanno The answer is 'never ever, if the owners want a pet-baby'
[1:40:52] <allanmiri> That boi be eating right.
[1:40:54] <%Raymanguy13> psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp
[1:40:54] <@ShockzNDrawe> I wish I had a ps5
[1:40:54] <%depressed_skeleton> greeeen
[1:40:54] <@SSaryn> cause u r green ez
[1:40:56] <%lumporr> it means go
[1:40:56] <NireFuster> Looks blue to me
[1:40:57] <%M4T1A5> Health?
[1:40:57] <%mield916> health bar probs
[1:40:58] <%coward_man> cause you're green class Pat
[1:40:59] <LoneFonte> life bar?
[1:41:00] <%Reaviar> its green cause technomancer is green
[1:41:00] <%Ranryu692> @PatStaresAt is there any cool DualSense stuff?
[1:41:03] <Bigyanno> Green is full health probably
[1:41:03] <%TEANTACLES> pat that's blue
[1:41:03] <+ScottishMadJacko> technomancer is green i guess
[1:41:06] <%Monkeyweed21> Thats blue pat
[1:41:07] <+ScottishMadJacko> MIne is blue rn
[1:41:16] <Ravioli_Ronin> If my console wasn’t trapped in a condemned building, I’d def check it out
[1:41:29] <allanmiri> Is your character hitting on that merchant?
[1:41:43] <%Pookiedaexzile> The girl voice is better to the point of it being a different game and character.
[1:41:46] <allanmiri> That's one way to get a discount.
[1:41:48] <%Nope80808> Green brown yellow?
[1:41:54] <%Jekado> because your suppose to do the side quest before the mission i think
[1:41:59] <s1rcuit> so did the lmg, and smg had armor piercing
[1:42:03] <luciluxlu0> how long is the demo again? I tried it on my xbox one and the loading is atrocious to me
[1:42:21] <%AzureGale> Shots inflict Ash Ketchum on enemies
[1:42:23] <rasseabreeze> Demo runs until release
[1:42:26] <%M4T1A5> Why does a slug shotgun have a range of 10 meters
[1:42:33] <%mield916> you cant trade
[1:42:38] <Reanimator83> The vendor next to her sells armor
[1:42:45] <s1rcuit> you get more scrap for trading
[1:42:50] <%lumporr> holy shit you guys i'm looking through details about this game for *anything* unique to grab ahold of and i am finding *nothing at all*
[1:42:51] <Vyskus> you lean in real close to this vender lady
[1:43:05] <ExpressNode> More like bone shards from all the enemies you exploded
[1:43:15] <%mield916> also trading rewards better, but scrapping can take perks off gear
[1:43:28] <%supergoblinpunch> Nothing screams Epic like a scrap of leather
[1:43:36] <VritraReiRei> never thought i would see the day i get to use multitwitch for Pat and Paige. Love you guys!
[1:43:48] <%cache_22> I wonder if there will be transmog for gear or weapons in the release version.
[1:43:51] <+half_awake1> half_awake1 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 22 months! 
[1:43:57] <Zulrez> So is this just a better Defiance?
[1:44:01] <LoneFonte> they confirmed no transmog
[1:44:20] <%Monkeyweed21> Is pat afraid of the skill tree?
[1:44:26] <@ShockzNDrawe> But Pat, can I look like a Star War in this game
[1:44:37] <Vyskus> is it a real ass skill tree or a skill line
[1:44:59] <s1rcuit> real tree
[1:45:02] <+BoBoCatBurger> real ass skill tree
[1:45:03] <%AzureGale> Is the skill tree better described as a skill forest
[1:45:11] <%bevyrage> @Vyskus three branch skill tree with some cross-branch synergy to make it a real ass skill tree
[1:45:32] <Vyskus> I'll take it that sounds great
[1:45:34] <%bevyrage> it's not like borderlands where you're expected to dedicated to one branch and then have a secondary. you're able to build how you wanna play proper
[1:45:44] <pth88> this looks incredibly generic
[1:45:58] <%depressed_skeleton> war crimes psaGib
[1:46:04] <%GarbageNirvana> But what if...MORE GUN
[1:46:08] <%supergoblinpunch> This is just Gears without the steroids
[1:46:31] <%bevyrage> the steroids are still here
[1:46:33] <KaironFortressKnight> This looks fun but holy shit its so brown
[1:46:34] <%Piemen99> oh wow
[1:46:37] <%AzureGale> World tier? Is this Outriders or Genshin Impact?
[1:46:48] <Too_Much_Nukie> SO MANY SKILLS
[1:46:49] <%CalderGaming> Return Of Brown Shooter
[1:46:50] <+dante_must_die_exe> PoE NotLikeThis
[1:46:51] <+allups> tech shaman
[1:46:52] <Escherite> They also let you respec whenever the hell you want
[1:46:53] <LoneFonte> the steroids are just magic steroids
[1:46:53] <@Moobot> Check out Outriders! It seems rad! No seriously look at it https://i.try.games/outriders/reca07
[1:46:54] <%bevyrage> world tier is both game difficulty and loot drops
[1:46:55] <Vyskus> oh geez that's big

[1:47:40] <+Bupkis7> The middle tree is the tank tree for all classses
[1:47:40] <Slimshazbot> Hurty Sandman is that guy from Vermont right?
[1:47:43] <+Cerabret100> top is weapon tree, mid is survivability tree, bottom is powerrs tree

[1:48:24] <stevenellis386> healing is always nice
[1:48:29] <cosmicdischarge> every class has the same
[1:48:41] <Shastafield> number go up
[1:49:00] <%Jekado> demolisher seems good for BIG DAMAGE
[1:49:04] <%dekkitout> Always min max cooldowns, kids
[1:49:14] <ergulor> oh

[1:49:17] <+Bupkis7> You don't have to hold it
[1:49:18] <+allups> thats whats u want

[1:49:21] <%UvBenServed> psaBig Kreygasm
[1:49:25] <%AzureGale> That's friggin' awesome
[1:49:27] <+the_pluviam> Yo Pat,you getting MH Rise on Switch or waiting on the PC port next year?
[1:49:28] <LoneFonte> always enjoy easy respec
[1:49:28] <%ClericOfSparda> Probably only for the demo
[1:49:29] <%depressed_skeleton> good![
[1:49:31] <ZilverZap> is it gonna be like this in the main game?
[1:49:32] <Visorak6> I wonder if that's demo only though
[1:49:32] <Oxybe> free resets are awesome
[1:49:51] <%logoth_> How is the video game
[1:49:59] <stevenellis386> so you can reset your points whenever you want. Thats pretty cool
[1:50:05] <%cache_22> Do you get skill points at every level or did I miss why they got the skill points?
[1:50:06] <Vyskus> respec is so good, I'll stop playing a game if I learn I screwed my build
[1:50:08] <%doc_ock_rokc> Congrats pat n Page I am sorry I couldn't say congrats earlier but im kinda fucked this month
[1:50:10] <Oxybe> completion challenges
[1:50:25] <%dekkitout> Are there loadouts that can auto spec/respec
[1:50:31] <+BoBoCatBurger> @cache_22 im guessing its every few levels
[1:50:38] <%Teyaric> The trophies implied you can use different /classes/?
[1:51:11] <+BoBoCatBurger> @Teyaric make multiple characters
[1:51:13] <cosmicdischarge> after lvl 5 you will always get 1 skill point @cache_22
[1:51:18] <burgersteel> rust in the form of a gun
[1:51:35] <%Jekado> she kinda has to
[1:51:47] <%Jekado> her powers don't really work a far range
[1:51:55] <%TEANTACLES> this game looks... really boring. like what if gaas were made in 2011
[1:52:04] <s1rcuit> nah I noticed that getting into and out of cover is a bit fucky in this
[1:52:05] <%dekkitout> Cmon pat you're support, adjust Kappa
[1:52:08] <%Teyaric> Is there a Lightning class?
[1:52:11] <+Cerabret100> peach is supposed to go hard with that class, just not that hard in front of a mini boss
[1:52:18] <+number1ichiban> So far this is giving me Virtua Fighter vibes, as in while the game's style and aesthetic aren't particularly unique, it has a level of depth that makes it stand out from other games of its type.
[1:52:29] <%BestTeaMaker> SPACE COWBOY
[1:52:34] <%BestTeaMaker> SEE YOU LATER
[1:52:36] <%Monkeyweed21> thats a good pistol name
[1:52:36] <+ScottishMadJacko> The space cowboy huh
[1:52:44] <+HimakiLuvsU> is this just Destiny?
[1:52:50] <%Teyaric> Is that the frikkin Erina's Vow?!
[1:53:03] <%bevyrage> no friendly fire? i bet quietshy hates this game then
[1:53:06] <+Cerabret100> @Teyaric kinda, thje trickster seems to have a lightning graphical base, but i don't hink its actual lightning damage
[1:53:08] <Visorak6> But does she block bullets
[1:53:09] <LeeOhX> so is this destiny 3 ?
[1:53:13] <%Monkeyweed21> The bullets see and then they hear
[1:53:22] <ZilverZap> apparently there are epics in this game tho i haven't found any
[1:53:34] <%dekkitout> Like friggin Loki LUL
[1:53:42] <%M4T1A5> Oh no it's Waframe again
[1:53:43] <%Teyaric> Look Out, Tenno. It's The Grinneer.
[1:53:47] <+TopTieramisu> holy shit, you're fighting todou?
[1:54:06] <%logoth_> run away from the red jelly
[1:54:06] <@Moobot> Check out Outriders! It seems rad! No seriously look at it https://i.try.games/outriders/reca07
[1:54:25] <%lumporr> you know what this actually looks pretty cool
[1:54:27] <%dekkitout> Come to think of it, the rogue class has Ash's teleport strike and Saryn's lash
[1:54:44] <laguerrilha> Never heard of this game, is it like Gears of War?
[1:55:05] <+Dova573> how does the ps5 haptics feel in this game pat?
[1:55:09] <%Pookiedaexzile> Yes
[1:55:14] <+ScottishMadJacko> The turret sticks to walls?
[1:55:17] <%supergoblinpunch> It's trying to be
[1:55:20] <+coffeefiend97> this reminds me of Mass Effect's multiplayer
[1:55:34] <%bevyrage> turret sticks to walls
[1:55:38] <+TopTieramisu> YEET
[1:55:44] <+Dova573> ME3 multiplayer was fun for what it was
[1:55:44] <%logoth_> did Peach just izuna drop him
[1:55:56] <Oxybe> friend turret is great. mvp.
[1:56:00] <laguerrilha> Oh cool this really looks like Gears cover system. nice, i miss this
[1:56:01] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt if you hold the button for the mine for a second but don't throw it, you'll get a throw arc
[1:56:17] <+BoBoCatBurger> he knows
[1:56:20] <%dekkitout> Bigger number? Cheese it D:
[1:56:22] <SweatyMercury> This kinda reminds me of how Dark Void looked
[1:56:24] <%EternalJedi> @PatStaresAt World Tier
[1:56:27] <%StrawberryPantsu> This game looks Uninspired...
[1:56:28] <%mield916> you didnt read what the world tiers do, did ya
[1:56:28] <%octavian_wolf> hey pat, I heard you liked nightfall mechanics lol
[1:56:28] <LoneFonte> World tier 4 is your level +1
[1:56:32] <+Cerabret100> they'd never expect you to roll IN to the grenades. Big Brain Pat
[1:56:33] <%chiazam> Pat says he shouldn't rush in, Rushes in anyway
[1:56:35] <%M4T1A5> Isn't enemy level literally what the World Tier changes
[1:56:46] <%EternalJedi> M4T1A5 yes
[1:56:59] <%EternalJedi> specifically the enemy's level relative to yours
[1:57:04] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> Is Outriders some kind of sex game or something?
[1:57:05] <%Pookiedaexzile> Welcome to hell
[1:57:17] <@ShockzNDrawe> apparently she deaf
[1:57:25] <%BoxNavy> good one...
[1:57:30] <%dekkitout> Her subtitles are off I think
[1:57:33] <%ssjklyco> She's not even listening to you now
[1:57:43] <Shastafield> LUL
[1:57:44] <%depressed_skeleton> Imagine READING
[1:57:45] <@ShockzNDrawe> I mean
[1:57:48] <%chiazam> Lmaooooo
[1:57:48] <laguerrilha> what a strange fiction
[1:57:52] <@ShockzNDrawe> They COULD have gotten that added last minute
[1:57:53] <+MajorCrasher> LUL
[1:57:54] <%walternatorz> Paige is blind and deaf when she reads.
[1:57:56] <%lumporr> oh
[1:57:59] <%Ranryu692> @PatStaresAt Rednecks are always causing trouble in DC. Usually they're just in Congress
[1:58:02] <%UvBenServed> Did Kojima work on this?
[1:58:03] <%dekkitout> Thats pretty Kojima tier
[1:58:04] <@ShockzNDrawe> THEORETICALLY
[1:58:09] <s1rcuit> yeah, but you can sneak in voice line's pretty quick, also it could be entirely unrelated incident
[1:58:11] <Zeemod155> Hey call the voice actors back in, I got a real spicy joke to put in chapter 2!
[1:58:14] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> Almost as if those people fit some kind of stereotype or something
[1:58:22] <%IncredibleMeh> Pat they can add things in as they develop
[1:58:22] <+Dova573> how outlandish, they would not helped stop the rednecks
[1:58:28] <+Dova573> 'have
[1:58:29] <laguerrilha> yo that turrent skill is sick!
[1:58:30] <+topiodonk> is pat having the big Fun?
[1:58:34] <%depressed_skeleton> This is still the best looking australian game i have ever seen.
[1:58:38] <%EternalJedi> ShockzNDrawe it's just a dialogue sequence, I can't imagine it'd be that hard to put in provided they get the voice lines done
[1:58:39] <+marlborored5> this game reminds me a lot of remnant of the ashes
[1:58:42] <%chiazam> God there's so many
[1:58:53] <@ShockzNDrawe> Yeah but like
[1:58:55] <@ShockzNDrawe> why
[1:58:58] <+HimakiLuvsU> STAY WITH THE FIRETEAM <3
[1:59:00] <%EternalJedi> marlborored5 similar structure
[1:59:18] <%toastybites> how
[1:59:23] <+marlborored5> @EternalJedi yeah, the idea is there
[1:59:32] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> So this is a S.T.A.L.K.E.R version of Destiny?
[1:59:39] <%bevyrage> they're stashing loot that you know you want
[1:59:40] <Louie_Salmon> So is this kinda like Remnant:.from the ashes?
[1:59:40] <Chatterbox1991> Pat confirmed UN
[1:59:40] <laguerrilha> Are the devs that made this the same of Gears 1-3? The guns, chunky enemies, speed, cover, all look so similar
[1:59:45] <+topiodonk> yea, this game feels like remnant or the division, but cooler
[1:59:50] <%supergoblinpunch> So I'm guessing the Devs really like brown.
[1:59:54] <%EternalJedi> MORE NADES
[1:59:59] <Oxybe> YO
[2:00:04] <%rawrmeowxd> FORTNITE PogChamp
[2:00:08] <Manwad> oh this game's gonna get fucking wild at later levels then
[2:00:11] <%dekkitout> Implying you could end up throwing like 5 mines in engame sipsipGasm
[2:00:19] <+TheBitingIrish> I love when games let you roll to reduce fire procs
[2:00:19] <%Reaviar> i got the same thing on my pyro's fire wave thing but i got it on my helmet and chest piece so i can spam 3 before it goes on cooldown
[2:00:20] <Visorak6> Looks like equipping skill modifying equipment puts everything on CD to prevent abuse
[2:00:26] <%chiazam> Luck is a skill
[2:00:27] <+Cerabret100> @supergoblinpunch its just this area, its a small bombed out valley on a lush planet with murder storms
[2:00:36] <+BoBoCatBurger> @supergoblinpunch i think its just this area cause the tutorial was hella green
[2:00:55] <%rawrmeowxd> PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[2:01:02] <%M4T1A5> I wonder how good the scaling with these skill will be

[2:01:29] <%bevyrage> was there a chest in the water?

[2:02:09] <+topiodonk> that would be cool to watch
[2:02:10] <s1rcuit> what made them decide to do this coop?
[2:02:10] <NeonBleu> He can't not complain
[2:02:13] <%Piemen99> a thing that will happen once every three months
[2:02:13] <%Pookiedaexzile> "This game is amazing, its just why can't there be more animal girls "
[2:02:16] <%bevyrage> there might've been a chest back before the door in the river
[2:02:16] <%mield916> you missed 2 chests pat
[2:02:29] <%BubbaRands> I'd rather he did complain
[2:02:30] <$Velyndra> hue hue hue pat removed VIP from me

[2:10:04] <%coward_man> there's lore stuff where the original Outriders on Earth were seen as Jedi cause they would go into destroyed cities and rescue people
[2:10:05] <%depressed_skeleton> Delicious soul energy
[2:10:08] <T_Sasquatch> freelancer. Destiny man. Arisen etc etc
[2:10:10] <burgersteel> Molok does not exist, stop talking about him

[2:10:12] <%rawrmeowxd> infamous vibes LUL
[2:10:13] <+TheBitingIrish> Moloch is a biblical term
[2:10:14] <%Mr_Pylon> Does the world palette ever change from brown and grey?
[2:10:24] <Parapattern> Moloch has got to be the most overused big bad guy name
[2:10:32] <%Mr_Pylon> oh thank god
[2:10:41] <Radioactivetaco9> so is this game suppossed to be a full live service destiny style or will it be a more singleplayer focued looter shooter like borderlands
[2:10:45] <%rawrmeowxd> MODOK? @burgersteel
[2:10:46] <%Pookiedaexzile> Mutant Dad, and Punished Mom, in a War, with a monster drunk uncle coming to ruin the party
[2:10:47] <+TheBitingIrish> Thank fuck
[2:10:54] <jorniev> hope there is a red zone
[2:10:56] <allanmiri> Yay snow! I love snow in games!

[2:10:59] <%Monkeyweed21> there is many purple later on
[2:11:06] <+Cerabret100> @Mr_Pylon this is a bombed out valley where people fightr because its the only place the murder storms don't hit. the rest of the planet is alien lush idyllic

[2:11:16] <laguerrilha> did you guys got the boss gun?
[2:11:20] <super_robo_mg> yooo sick coat

[2:11:25] <NireFuster> The PS5 version also looks very different graphically, it even has different lighting
[2:11:30] <NireFuster> So that may play into the whole color palette thing

[2:11:42] <%Jay_Squirrel> oh no the clipping on the coat
[2:11:45] <LoneFonte> repeat the quest until it drops?
[2:11:47] <allanmiri> Pat looks like he's gonna ask me, "What are ya buyin?"
[2:11:48] <+TheBitingIrish> Do you really only get to use 3 skills at a time? FeelsBadMan
[2:11:50] <%chiazam> DO IT OVER AND OVER
[2:11:50] <%rawrmeowxd> LUL @dekkitout
[2:11:51] <%Ranryu692> @NireFuster this is the PS5 version
[2:11:53] <%Deft_Thought> @Radioactivetaco9 They're planning to follow the Remnant: From the Ashes model. Release expansions but no live service shit
[2:12:03] <hammerstein50> just got here hows the game?
[2:12:16] <NireFuster> @Ranryu692 I know, that's why I said it, I'm looking at Peach's stream too and hers looks different, slightly darker, and different lighting
[2:12:18] <+HelloImTom08> I got a gold drop from one of the side quest chest so I guess its just random
[2:12:20] <%Pookiedaexzile> Back to Reality
[2:12:28] <allanmiri> I'm saying Pat looks like the RE4 merchant.
[2:12:30] <%rawrmeowxd> do some sick ass trick shots
[2:12:35] <+BoBoCatBurger> @hammerstein50 generic looking but pretty fun imo
[2:12:38] <rasseabreeze> Yeah the coat is cool but theres some rough clipping on it
[2:12:56] <%dekkitout> My eyes are shit, I can't tell
[2:13:03] <+TheBitingIrish> Big clippin'
[2:13:07] <%depressed_skeleton> quick unfriend paige
[2:13:13] <Too_Much_Nukie> It's a magic coat.
[2:13:14] <%Pookiedaexzile> Way less contrast, and less bright
[2:13:15] <hammerstein50> @bobocatburger graphics don't matter anymore to me I just wanna have fun
[2:13:15] <+topiodonk> feels like home
[2:13:19] <%walternatorz> where's your red beret?
[2:13:20] <NireFuster> Looking at both streams rn and yeah there's a pretty substantial difference in lighting, you can probably check once the stream is done
[2:13:22] <CatsDrunkonCopper> I think legendarys drop on the side quest shira gives
[2:13:24] <%Jay_Squirrel> man good thing i wasnt gonna play tech dude cause that clipping would annoy the shit out of me
[2:13:27] <%rawrmeowxd> pupper DX
[2:13:30] <allanmiri> Will we ever NOT have clipping? Only time will tell.
[2:13:30] <+TheBitingIrish> Squeenix DGAF 'bout clipping
[2:13:33] <%Reaviar> a games best feature is how much of your character clips through their clothes

[2:15:23] <%dekkitout> "Hey Nico, wanna go bowling in anomaly?"
[2:15:29] <allanmiri> @yourliteraldog I still say he looks like the RE4 merchant with the face cover.
[2:15:35] <yourliteraldog> It's the anomaly
[2:15:41] <%BestTeaMaker> oh, this is the one that quietshy posted
[2:16:01] <yourliteraldog> It's just face from behind he just looks homeless
[2:16:09] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt those answers are short
[2:16:10] <yourliteraldog> But cool homeless
[2:16:13] <Namelessmirror> This quest is the farm one i think
[2:16:23] <allanmiri> At least it gives you the option to ask.
[2:16:46] <allanmiri> Instead of telling you, "I don't even have time to explain why I don't have time to explain."
[2:16:48] <akitanito> What's with all the shaking
[2:16:55] <ValentineWolf7> How you liking the synergy between the weapons, armor, and abilities? @PatStaresAt

[2:17:50] <%AzureGale> lol Beastie Boys
[2:17:55] <%chiazam> Why is Pat playing this on PS5 and not on PC?
[2:17:59] <allanmiri> WTF Beasty Boys!?

[2:18:48] <allanmiri> Her face has seen some stuff, but that body tho!
[2:18:48] <%lumporr> in the grim dark future there are *only* pilates
[2:18:48] <%weissguard> Is it just me, or was the audio not syncing up with her animations there ?
[2:18:53] <%walternatorz> what do you think set everyone on this path?
[2:19:02] <%walternatorz> pilates.
[2:19:02] <%rawrmeowxd> She looks like a fallout 3 ghoul WutFace
[2:19:05] <%EternalJedi> that's a high quality pen
[2:19:10] <zerointelligence000> do you think she has any ancient dildos?
[2:19:15] <%BubbaRands> Is that a PAPERCLIP?!
[2:19:16] <yourliteraldog> Dragon Age 2 had that problem too. Flemeth's titties where perky af
[2:19:17] <%Ranryu692> that's as good a justification for collecting shit as any
[2:19:47] <$RealThiele> npc gilf has giefs binky
[2:19:54] <Nobuwaroo> lookin shnazzy
[2:19:54] <allanmiri> @yourliteraldog That could be explained with magic though. I can imagine Flemeth would be the type to cast a perky spell on her boobies
[2:20:01] <%bevyrage> it's also a good excuse to have in-game nostalgia for stuff that is from the real world
[2:20:32] <+Cerabret100> oh i didn't realize this quest had an actua area, i thought it was just passive collectibles in the word
[2:20:35] <NeroInfinite> Wait if anything more advanced than a toaster explodes..how are they making ammo for all these guns? or evne making MORE guns?
[2:20:53] <yourliteraldog> farm resources
[2:20:59] <%rawrmeowxd> shhhh @NeroInfinite
[2:21:01] <yourliteraldog> toil the earth
[2:21:11] <+Cerabret100> bullets and guns at their base aren't that complex, or electronic
[2:21:32] <allanmiri> God that dude is just a puddle after that shot!
[2:21:36] <NeroInfinite> Yeah but the turrets tho'.
[2:21:44] <%Ranryu692> you got points for that in Bulletstorm
[2:21:50] <%rawrmeowxd> weird flex but ok Pat LUL
[2:21:57] <VritraReiRei> how long is this demo anyways?
[2:21:57] <+Cerabret100> @NeroInfinite those are magic mutant power turrets
[2:21:58] <%Jekado> No its a glitch pat
[2:22:03] <%Jekado> it happened to strident
[2:22:09] <NeroInfinite> okay
[2:22:11] <yourliteraldog> Those turrets are magic so I guess that explains why they work
[2:22:12] <%AzureGale> Gred dots
[2:22:13] <Grunkle_Dan_> So is this the new hotness?
[2:22:28] <yourliteraldog> BLIGHTED
[2:22:28] <@Moobot> Check out Outriders! It seems rad! No seriously look at it https://i.try.games/outriders/reca07
[2:22:29] <Jaysky> She's like toast cause she on FIYA
[2:22:41] <MasterTonberry23> just got here, is this destiny?
[2:22:46] <$RealThiele> ability power is pretty generic sounding
[2:22:59] <Jaysky> It's inventory sure looks like Destiny
[2:23:00] <%Agami23> its the titanfall move
[2:23:06] <Radioactivetaco9> so its vortex shield from titanfall?
[2:23:14] <%dekkitout> Saryn sipsipGasm
[2:23:19] <+Cerabret100> oof a one minute cooldown though
[2:23:19] <yourliteraldog> Destiny if it was gears of war and also kinda good
[2:23:25] <@SSaryn> Hello I am Saryn
[2:23:32] <super_robo_mg> but the double grenade hat
[2:23:41] <%bevyrage> like the LMG's or assault rifles
[2:23:41] <allanmiri> I will say that out of all the recent Shlooter games this one has sparked my interest the most.
[2:23:42] <%rawrmeowxd> v e r y n i c e
[2:23:43] <yourliteraldog> Also more generic looking
[2:23:47] <%Reaviar> pat keeping paige healthy is semi meta at this point
[2:23:52] <%dekkitout> I meant the Warfame ya jerk
[2:23:56] <Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> a Trest, you say?
[2:23:58] <+NicDanger> This game made Destiny undo sunsetting lmao
[2:24:07] <+allups> i wish it controlled more like remnant
[2:24:09] <akitanito> committing war crimes for loot
[2:24:14] <$RealThiele> i feel that healing paige-meta in my soul
[2:24:15] <+Houndemise> pat, will you continue your progress on the ps5?
[2:24:19] <+Cerabret100> pat got some new britches
[2:24:22] <%Reaviar> naw it was anthems death that made em do that
[2:24:22] <%dekkitout> Warmind cells undid sunsetting LUL
[2:24:30] <allanmiri> Pat's blue dabadedada
[2:24:36] <+egalitarian696969> cool stats on armor is nice
[2:24:36] <+Cerabret100> also that ability modifier is fucking sick
[2:24:36] <Radioactivetaco9> the destiny community collectivly complaining even months after its implementation is what caused destiny to remove sunsetting
[2:24:37] <rasseabreeze> PAT
[2:24:37] <yourliteraldog> It also makes your dick look bigger
[2:24:37] <Manwad> this loot's super good I like it
[2:24:42] <rasseabreeze> the wrong rifle
[2:24:46] <Parapattern> That is a cool looking gun
[2:24:48] <zerointelligence000> can you switch classes in this game?
[2:24:51] <%rawrmeowxd> the shotgun is pretty sweet
[2:24:52] <%Ranryu692> yeah, I'm gonna check out this demo as soon as you're done streaming lol
[2:24:56] <allanmiri> I like the sound it makes.
[2:24:58] <+Dova573> I love gear that do more than just basic stats increases
[2:25:09] <%dekkitout> Oh speaking of, theres a new Destiny bug that enables 12 person raids SeriousSloth
[2:25:15] <%rawrmeowxd> someone got their borderlands in my fortnite
[2:25:26] <+NicDanger> Ok, this game made them ANNOUNCE that they are getting rid of sunsetting
[2:25:28] <%Agami23> this is diffidently very borderlands
[2:25:42] <zerointelligence000> that's some nurgle shit
[2:25:43] <ergulor> and it heals you over time too
[2:25:45] <@SSaryn> LUL
[2:25:47] <akitanito> you could have just jumped over that knee-high obstacle
[2:25:54] <Clundy> thas a lotta damage
[2:26:01] <allanmiri> Those fucking campers!
[2:26:02] <Jaysky> I don't see this as Borderlands
[2:26:07] <%Ranryu692> that's a lot of dudes
[2:26:07] <%rawrmeowxd> holy shit RIP
[2:26:11] <allanmiri> Tank em Paige!
[2:26:14] <+TheBitingIrish> @NicDanger They're stopping sunsetting GOING FOWARD, not altogether. Still sucks
[2:26:20] <+b_aleph> Is this Marvel vs Capcom 2?
[2:26:26] <%Reaviar> and this is why pyromancer is awesome, could have just burned all them alive and moved on
[2:26:31] <dots4eyes> That  Man
[2:26:36] <super_robo_mg> does page's bullet catching shield protect pat too?
[2:26:52] <+NicDanger> @TheBitingIrish yeah its funny
[2:26:57] <%CalderGaming> is that pat's official Husband Noise
[2:27:15] <akitanito> wat.
[2:27:19] <MrPandastic> I've been playing the Devastator class and it super feels like the Krogan Adept from the ME3 Multiplayer. Its pretty great.
[2:27:27] <allanmiri> I wanna know what that looks like
[2:27:27] <MasterTonberry23> my daddy always told me "son if you ever find a girl interested in those dumbass vidya games, you better marry her"
[2:27:29] <+b_aleph> sick
[2:27:31] <+spottedwolf10> Is this Destiny meets Fallout meets The Divison?
[2:27:38] <+b_aleph> Is this Mortal Kombat?
[2:27:42] <$RealThiele> fart gas super effective
[2:27:45] <allanmiri> @MasterTonberry23 Good advice.
[2:27:47] <%supergoblinpunch> Do the elements combo at all?
[2:27:53] <%rawrmeowxd> Where is claptrap??
[2:29:06] <%coward_man> yes
[2:29:21] <allanmiri> Paige just went upside your head.
[2:29:36] <%vivaldiva> this is basically just the Division but in space, with actual story. I'm down with it
[2:29:36] <@Moobot> Check out Outriders! It seems rad! No seriously look at it https://i.try.games/outriders/reca07
[2:29:41] <%EternalJedi> considering progress carries over, yeah
[2:29:46] <%dekkitout> I mean... implying folks wont minmax the game withing 28 hours of launch

[2:30:09] <allanmiri> Best cutscene ever.
[2:30:17] <%JoshManVGH> This is my favorite quest
[2:30:20] <$SGrim> That was incredibly charmingly shit PogChamp
[2:30:23] <AoG_JarlRaven> That’s a cutscene folks
[2:30:28] <%Piemen99> you know i don't know why i trusted pat with that
[2:30:33] <%bevyrage> !outriders
[2:30:33] <@Moobot> Check out Outriders! It seems rad! No seriously look at it https://i.try.games/outriders/reca07
[2:30:36] <%greasypete00> that looks cool too
[2:30:43] <AoG_JarlRaven> Is it skippable? Kek
[2:30:55] <%dekkitout> Oh yeah, bet
[2:31:01] <%Reaviar> that and your turrets keep you protected
[2:31:09] <allanmiri> You poison a guy and then freeze then and then snipe them to death... that's fucking evil...
[2:31:16] <%JoshManVGH> Now everyone can 360 noscope
[2:31:16] <%PanicSwytch> Is this
[2:31:22] <MasterTonberry23> so is this destiny meets the division?
[2:31:26] <Jaysky> Is Pat a technomancer?
[2:31:34] <%PanicSwytch> Is this F2P
[2:31:37] <yourliteraldog> Warcrimes
[2:31:39] <Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> @allanmiri while casting magic (literal) missle
[2:31:45] <%Reaviar> you can in emotes and when you use a sword for some reason
[2:31:46] <+Cerabret100> I love destiny'
[2:31:51] <+Shiso666> use a sword and you can see your character
[2:31:51] <%JoshManVGH> Or any of the abilities.
[2:31:54] <Jaysky> That's fuckin stupid, Destiny has cool designs too
[2:31:59] <+Cerabret100> I love destiny's character asthetic but can almost never see it
[2:32:01] <akitanito> big dumb
[2:32:02] <%JoshManVGH> or any of the cool guns
[2:32:02] <Jaysky> Why would they limit your view of your cool character
[2:32:04] <%dekkitout> Not knowing third person is murdering the shit out of Destiny's pvp
[2:32:06] <%AzureGale> Pat the gun jumper
[2:32:06] <%rawrmeowxd> It's cool when they give you the option to switch between ast and 3rd imo
[2:32:10] <Tracazoid> Pat thought he was tanking in XIV
[2:32:11] <%chiazam> Can't you play Destiny in third person
[2:32:13] <%JoshManVGH> or any of the charm
[2:32:18] <Radioactivetaco9> destiny has tons of third person animations. including multiple sup[ers
[2:32:20] <%Reaviar> i dont like destiny i hate it with all my passion, which is why i have 2000 hours in it
[2:32:20] <ergulor> Becasue u are dumb and forget you're the sniper
[2:32:31] <akitanito> Just facetank that mortar pat
[2:32:34] <%JoshManVGH> @chiazam Only in town hubs
[2:32:38] <@SSaryn> Then.. why'd you throw it tho
[2:32:50] <Jaysky> Pat you're on fire sir, fire is hot
[2:32:50] <%dekkitout> @cYou can with swords and it's bogging down pvp game pacing with ppl looking around corners
[2:32:52] <Siconia> There isn't, Paige can use her jump ability to get there
[2:32:56] <+coldsama> Right now third person view in Destiny PVP is the thing to nerf can you imagine
[2:33:02] <green2814> what's your thought on the demo so far?
[2:33:13] <xbb1024> it's not invisible if you can see it
[2:33:17] <TehMud> Obviously the sniper mage is supposed to face tank gun
[2:33:36] <+Cerabret100> Devestators can tank some serious shit as long as they keep killing close range
[2:33:40] <Jaysky> I take it Peach is devastator?
[2:33:49] <yourliteraldog> pat your fire support you deal death from afar
[2:33:56] <%JoshManVGH> @jaysky Yep
[2:33:59] <%rawrmeowxd> RIP LUL
[2:34:01] <TehMud> I have Demo downloaded but waiting til tomorrow. I'm going Tank because SMASH PUNCH
[2:34:03] <%chiazam> welp
[2:34:03] <MrPandastic> Devastator is very UNGA BUNGA
[2:34:05] <Frostydough1> Pat showing us death animations in all games :D
[2:34:11] <penitentpendant> Paige's tendency towards Bunga definitely makes her choosing a tank class good synergy
[2:34:23] <+superrhubarbpie> this has to be a GaaS right
[2:34:26] <Jaysky> Huh. This game is way more interesting than I initially thought, the combat looks fun
[2:34:26] <$Afterman_> easy mode is now unlocked
[2:34:31] <%chiazam> Pat's not seeing the grenades
[2:34:38] <TehMud> Imma UNGA and ah BUNGA
[2:34:50] <+Cerabret100> that missle launcher goes way farther than i expect it to
[2:34:56] <%JoshManVGH> Why shoot when you can ROCK!
[2:35:10] <zerointelligence000> just started my download for the demo, here's hoping my laptop can run it!
[2:35:10] <TehMud> Cant stop the rock
[2:35:25] <MrPandastic> The Devastator's Gravity Fall ability is pretty fun as it just lets you go in super hard.
[2:35:40] <$Afterman_> so is this just another godfall?
[2:36:07] <TehMud> Nah more like Destiny/Division
[2:36:10] <%JoshManVGH> @afterman_ No, it's not a live service game.
[2:36:12] <TehMud> Minus the live service part
[2:36:21] <MasterTonberry23> this just looks like destiny + the division to me
[2:36:28] <TehMud> This game is a game. There's no endless content
[2:36:30] <%dekkitout> That's quite a bit of damage
[2:36:36] <+Cerabret100> godfalls not a live service either though
[2:36:37] <@Moobot> Check out Outriders! It seems rad! No seriously look at it https://i.try.games/outriders/reca07

[2:37:21] <%EternalJedi> @PatStaresAt was that sidearm named Space Cowboy?
[2:37:26] <$Afterman_> so this is more akin to remnant from the ashes then
[2:37:30] <%JoshManVGH> @cerabret100 Seriously? i thought that was Epics whole plan for it
[2:37:32] <metaphase72> Just joined the stream, how is the game?
[2:37:38] <%EternalJedi> Afterman_ in terms of game structure, yes
[2:37:47] <%rawrmeowxd> model clipping psaDown
[2:37:58] <+Cerabret100> @JoshManVGH no godfall specifically made a point to say they weren't doing the games as a service model

[2:39:20] <MasterTonberry23> anyone remember this game called inversion?
[2:39:20] <%JoshManVGH> @afterman_ yeah im totally wrong. it's still very much a looter shooter, but the online component is strictly coop. So ability design is a little more wild.
[2:39:20] <%greasypete00> so is this like not taking itself too seriously kind of thing or is it just failing at trying to be serious, b/c i kinda get the vibes that its the former
[2:39:22] <+TheBitingIrish> Oh nooo

[2:45:58] <+TopTieramisu> femshep is canon
[2:46:04] <allanmiri> Gurl gamers unit!
[2:46:04] <Too_Much_Nukie> Femshep is very not-canon.
[2:46:07] <%AzureGale> They're both canon
[2:46:08] <%octavian_wolf> it is now lol]
[2:46:11] <allanmiri> Femshep should be canon.
[2:46:15] <$Afterman_> assasscredd odyess is the fem canon
[2:46:15] <%Mrbaconator> femshep is superior
[2:46:19] <%Reaviar> both are canon in different timelines
[2:46:22] <+Kingtut9009> Male Shepard has the goofiest face and well always be better cause of it
[2:46:23] <%rawrmeowxd> 1-3??? LUL ok?
[2:46:26] <%GarbageNirvana> So at 35 hours I wonder what the NG+ is gonna be like
[2:46:30] <allanmiri> The only bad thing about femshep is that you can't romance Tali.
[2:46:30] <%AzureGale> You can crossplay? :o
[2:46:30] <%Pookiedaexzile> Its almost as if they know, Femvoice is better in  this game
[2:46:35] <+TestAnon> $$$
[2:46:36] <Too_Much_Nukie> Femshep will not be the star of the upcoming adaptation.

[2:50:19] <%coward_man> Eli was saying in Paige's chat that he is enjoying it

[2:50:23] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt so what got Paige interested in this?

[2:51:05] <%KeiganOfAstora> Not everything
[2:51:09] <%Reaviar> main issue i see with crossplay is pc vs console in pvp games
[2:51:11] <%KeiganOfAstora> I don't want no PC hackers on my PS4
[2:51:15] <s1rcuit> @GalacticaPhanto faie enough

[2:52:06] <%BigDumBeak> I like when someone earlier called gun wizard a Warglock
[2:52:06] <%GalacticaPhanto> Some earlier said you're a Warglock and they're the best
[2:52:09] <cosmicdischarge> no
[2:52:11] <Escherite> Cutscenes need less camera shaking
[2:52:13] <%octavian_wolf> pvp is a nightmare in these games
[2:52:16] <cosmicdischarge> Devs Said No
[2:52:16] <%vaporousTippler> Damn, warglock is still making the rounds, huh?
[2:52:18] <%Pookiedaexzile> We will force them
[2:52:19] <%dekkitout> There's a history of pvp and shlooters not gelling well

[2:52:31] <Oxybe> Warglock will never die.
[2:52:33] <%GalacticaPhanto> @vaporoustippler To be fair it's a good name
[2:52:35] <+Houndemise> wow, nice
[2:52:38] <%sakeydo> Lol they cover the same points at the same time
[2:52:38] <+king_of_beggars> I like warglock, that's good
[2:52:39] <Visorak6> Is it on steam or another service?
[2:52:40] <%Pookiedaexzile> They learned
[2:52:41] <GarrisonPrime> Like Borderlands
[2:52:41] <Radioactivetaco9> That is a massive plus in my book
[2:52:42] <%Reaviar> its how games should be
[2:52:47] <%Ranryu692> it's going to be what Destiny should've been
[2:52:50] <%octavian_wolf> I should know, I've been plaing Iron Banner all week
[2:52:50] <%coward_man> it is a RPG but with co-op and expansions
[2:52:52] <%GarbageNirvana> GaaS is outta gas
[2:52:52] <%Mrbaconator> WARGLOCK
