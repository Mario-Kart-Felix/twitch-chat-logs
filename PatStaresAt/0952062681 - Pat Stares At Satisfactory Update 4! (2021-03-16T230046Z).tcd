[0:23:29] <+Danofthetubes> strong
[0:23:30] <TrollKing96> @PatStaresAt Since you said that the update to Satisfactory changes some core parts to the game, is there a name for games that have continuous updates that can have drastic changes?
[0:23:30] <%holydeviant1> 3

[0:29:28] <%KeiganOfAstora> The sheet is the line that controls the sails on a ship. If the line is not secured, the sail flops in the wind, and the ship loses headway and control. If all three sails are loose, the ship is out of control.

[0:50:43] <sonofthedeepsouth> AWESOME
[0:50:56] <sonofthedeepsouth> GREAT GAME
[0:50:56] <%ThirdWelles> This way if the new build shits itself and makes the saves incompatible with the old build, you're not fucked
[0:51:04] <%Vibe__Lord> BEWARE monkaS
[0:51:08] <$stoptaknall> oh it's right there @PatStaresAt

[0:51:24] <putnampuppeteer> I'M SO EXCITED
[0:51:26] <%DrkJP520> Is this game demanding?
[0:51:26] <%blastyoboots> half-second freezes are conditional on you connecting a large pipeline/power/etc network connection (or aiming to) when it does its cross-back calculation, or the autosaves of course
[0:51:35] <$RealThiele> gaiz
[0:51:36] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt also, don't go back to normal with the same save until they move update 4 to the normal branch, it might screw you
[0:51:47] <%emperordread> "sAVE" is my favourite
[0:51:49] <%jarednotwithsubway> oh you can name saves? nice'

[0:52:21] <%holydeviant1> >Pat actually names his saves well
[0:52:22] <%MistyMntns> UI UPDATES
[0:52:23] <%holydeviant1> you what
[0:52:28] <+Nemesisnick33> 34h FeelsBadMan

[0:52:35] <$stoptaknall> @PatStaresAt did you see the trailer it's cute
[0:52:37] <%legendfather_of_giants> you can see power storage
[0:52:38] <+ccwettr123> well... looks like we found Pat's new obsession.
[0:52:39] <%KineticZen> Arfy
[0:52:41] <%MistyMntns> I watched the update stream today and it UI looks great
[0:52:42] <%honeyman18> They didd big dork stream and announcement video like a training video
[0:52:44] <CappuccinoGuil> Ziplines and PARTICLE ACCELERATOR
[0:52:48] <krymzen5> drones? dope
[0:52:48] <s1rcuit> all I know is that they added a lot of aerial transports

[0:52:57] <sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[0:52:57] <%BoxNavy> i am looking
[0:52:58] <%Wurmspawn> One update I can confirm is that Concrete stacks up past 200 a stack now. Which is good.
[0:52:59] <%ChestMimik> Why it's an automation game that seems normal
[0:52:59] <%TheJaydedFox> TheJaydedFox subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 18 months! 
[0:52:59] <%mield916> ziplines are on the caterium research tree pat
[0:53:00] <sonofthedeepsouth> I LOOK IT
[0:53:00] <%PanicSwytch> 5:36 am
[0:53:01] <Overloard> drones PogChamp
[0:53:01] <$stoptaknall> same
[0:53:03] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Most mods don't work in experimental. Different engine?
[0:53:03] <%honeyman18> same
[0:53:04] <sonofthedeepsouth> I SEES IT
[0:53:05] <+MisterAvry> that's a good idea
[0:53:06] <krymzen5> thats a great idea tbh
[0:53:06] <%Jekado> drones are for long range transportation
[0:53:06] <CappuccinoGuil> Pat stayed up until 6 AM playing this? ONE OF US! ONE OF US!
[0:53:07] <+ExclusivelyPlastic> That's actually a great idea
[0:53:08] <%MistyMntns> Dont forget about Lights
[0:53:08] <%atteroproxy> smart
[0:53:09] <%Jekado> thank fucking god for that
[0:53:09] <+allups> thats a good idea
[0:53:11] <Doofmaster> I could tell from the first VOD that Pat would be super addicted LUL
[0:53:13] <%ThirdWelles> That's smart
[0:53:13] <+necrocannibal2> what is this game
[0:53:14] <%dekkitout> Interesting tactic, General
[0:53:14] <+MassConnect> so where's the "My mom" save?
[0:53:16] <%MadPretty> Pat labels his saves like a man who has felt loss before
[0:53:21] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt you can stack concrete to 500 now, which is THE BEST
[0:53:23] <+Nemesisnick33> fine ill just look at the one what said 1 am
[0:53:23] <+ReallyBigRocks> I saw one that was at 6 AM
[0:53:23] <%SvenHolgersson> DELETE IT
[0:53:25] <%Mr_Pylon> late in, Satisfactory yay
[0:53:26] <+queaks> concrete stacks to 500 now
[0:53:30] <%texaporte> don't worry pat, i once played this for 18 hours straight
[0:53:32] <%SvenHolgersson> Start anew
[0:53:36] <%DrkJP520> How many times have you streamed this?
[0:53:39] <%honeyman18> check power
[0:53:47] <sonofthedeepsouth> BELTS
[0:53:51] <+necrocannibal2> is this just Subnautica?
[0:53:54] <%ThirdWelles> hey it's that stink place

[0:54:05] <CappuccinoGuil> @necrocannibal2 nah
[0:54:11] <+PenmanLupine> is Twitch shitting the bed for anyone else?
[0:54:13] <%ThirdWelles> @necrocannibal2 Nah, it's factorio
[0:54:14] <+PenmanLupine> or is that just me?
[0:54:22] <%holydeviant1> HOOOLY SHIT
[0:54:25] <%depressed_skeleton> oh pat....

[0:54:27] <%rumtumtugnutz> Just you
[0:54:27] <%Dunmarkh> @PenmanLupine it's been rough dude
[0:54:28] <%ThirdWelles> No survival elements. Just "build factory"

[0:54:38] <%UltraViolet371> THAT is some spaghetto
[0:54:39] <%putnampuppeteer> God it's beautiful
[0:54:40] <%atteroproxy> There are tubes now

[0:54:50] <%ChestMimik> You know you have a flashlight right?
[0:54:52] <+necrocannibal2> @ThirdWelles oh, good. as long as I don't have to fucking grind like in Subnautica.
[0:54:55] <%ThirdWelles> Twitch is always shitting itself. It's run by clown people
[0:54:57] <$stoptaknall> @PatStaresAt cool little tip with the right alt recipes you can get rid of screws entirely
[0:54:57] <%BinaryFireball> why does this not surprise me in the least. I remember when this was two buildings haha
[0:54:58] <$LocDogX86X> judybeBicbrain
[0:55:00] <%BoxNavy> they should let you label things
[0:55:00] <%honeyman18> not enough plates
[0:55:05] <%BinaryFireball> you're doing awesome pat
[0:55:06] <bonebagMEL> twitch is fine
[0:55:07] <%BoxNavy> do they let you label things?
[0:55:09] <+ReallyBigRocks> There have been tubes for a while
[0:55:11] <%wibbwobbler> there's a lot going on
[0:55:13] <+LowBatteryLife> Cover the planet in concrete and spaghetti, a blessed futur
[0:55:15] <+allups> u doing this all single player
[0:55:22] <krymzen5> so is the world random or premade?
[0:55:27] <sonofthedeepsouth> needs to streamline for that sweet sweer efficiency
[0:55:31] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt there's a reddit guy who makes compact, stackable floorplans to produce one part, which is great for when you just don't care about Space Elevator stuff
[0:55:38] <amiavamp> When you get trains you want to modularize your bases to specific functions
[0:55:41] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Can you color code certain building stuff so that you know where certain things 'should' be?
[0:55:42] <%BoxNavy> :) üìù of course (??????)
[0:55:44] <CappuccinoGuil> what is manifolding?
[0:55:45] <%asgard147> YOU TRAVEL IN TUBES?! but do you lead as two kings? limesSip
[0:55:46] <%ThirdWelles> @necrocannibal2 Oh man, it's entire goal is to move towards automation. If the grind makes you annoyed, this is probably the most satisfying thing ever
[0:55:53] <sonofthedeepsouth> loud gief
[0:55:57] <sonofthedeepsouth> GIEF LOVES IT
[0:56:03] <Overloard> just bus it dawg
[0:56:05] <rReizs> there is a colour gun that changes colours but you need to research it
[0:56:13] <%ThirdWelles> The big dick save
[0:56:18] <+ReallyBigRocks> water extractors SNAP NOW!!!
[0:56:20] <%legendfather_of_giants> oh god the headlift

[0:56:40] <%MistyMntns> Pat needs to get the little mini car
[0:56:40] <%atteroproxy> Pat is now ready for his industrial engineering job

[0:57:00] <%walternatorz> psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin
[0:57:02] <%BoxNavy> what about the balls?

[0:57:04] <Djinnazz> that's not very optimal.
[0:57:04] <OwlLightningMage> excuse me

[0:57:08] <%AzureGale> Pat built the factory using his dick?
[0:57:09] <%WhereIsWill> psaBig pat dick energy
[0:57:10] <rReizs> found a lake with like 3 coal spots next to it and its amazing
[0:57:12] <wangus1492> patented
[0:57:12] <%weissguard> Straight off the dick, no lube
[0:57:15] <%maskofmichael> Dicks out for Mind Goblins
[0:57:16] <+OhioNitsud> str8 off da deez with these
[0:57:17] <CappuccinoGuil> @BoxNavy that's where the save is stored
[0:57:18] <Tisaric> oh god you run so slow without the runners
[0:57:18] <%holydeviant1> This is what novice factories always look like

[0:57:20] <%fakeburg> Pat's Dick Tips psaUp
[0:57:21] <%MadPretty> Knowledge is stored in the balls
[0:57:24] <Doofmaster> conveyors along the ground are my biggest pet peeve in this game. Raise those things onto stackables so you can walk under them and not have to jump everywhere
[0:57:26] <PanicSwytch> This is Pats Factory Dystopia
[0:57:27] <%notsoy> the lake with 3 pure coal nodes is ridiculous lol
[0:57:30] <CappuccinoGuil> O P T I M I Z E D
[0:57:32] <Sparda_blizzard> this is actually good
[0:57:32] <amiavamp> Protip, if you start on Northern Forest, your entire base will be vertically stacked spaghetti, there is no space to build
[0:57:33] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Gravity works on fluids. Pump it into a reservoir up high and gravity will siphon it to any lower point.
[0:57:36] <%Nested_Dreams> Oh right, the new update makes all power gen run at full blast all the time, check your fuel rates
[0:57:40] <yourliteraldog> Pat-chanicus
[0:57:41] <%ThirdWelles> This is Pat's factory UTOPIA
[0:57:43] <%honeyman18> icon on the compass
[0:57:49] <sonofthedeepsouth> concrete
[0:57:54] <%jarednotwithsubway> rainforest has a ton of pure nodes, its pretty good for a new start
[0:57:57] <%BoxNavy> whens the satisfactory youtube series
[0:58:00] <yourliteraldog> Forge World Mind Gobbos
[0:58:06] <$Dakuu75> yeah, monopolize that bio-economy, pat~!
[0:58:09] <%blastyoboots> you gotta store power now or something
[0:58:11] <%Nested_Dreams> Shits stable psaUp
[0:58:16] <Overloard> have you considered running powerlines instead of conveyors, for aesthetic purposes of course
[0:58:17] <%BoxNavy> die
[0:58:17] <%MistyMntns> Explore
[0:58:19] <amiavamp> Build bigger factory
[0:58:20] <%MistyMntns> Get harddrives
[0:58:22] <+koriar> nothing
[0:58:22] <Psyramics> do it again but better this time
[0:58:24] <Doofmaster> it's a simulation game, it's kind of up to you
[0:58:25] <%honeyman18> MAKE BIG ROLLER COASTER
[0:58:25] <sonofthedeepsouth> improve
[0:58:25] <+ReallyBigRocks> make bigger factory
[0:58:26] <%MistyMntns> Get all the easter eggs
[0:58:27] <%JumboCrunchies> Make it bigger
[0:58:28] <abelincoln_catpuncher> O P T O M I Z R
[0:58:29] <LVL1_Scumbag> Optimize further
[0:58:29] <%Wurmspawn> Wait for the game to come off of early access.
[0:58:31] <%ChestMimik> Play factorio waiting for updates
[0:58:32] <sonofthedeepsouth> IMPROVE FACTORY LAYOUT
[0:58:33] <EvanDude47> mod it
[0:58:33] <%MadPretty> Become more efficient
[0:58:33] <skrewarrior> bigger
[0:58:34] <+TheCrispyBoi> make it better
[0:58:37] <%za7az> Wait for the story to be implemented?
[0:58:38] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt since all power runs at max now, I would recommend building some power storage right away to avoid all that waste
[0:58:38] <amiavamp> There will probably be a postgame sink to dump things into eventually like in Factorio
[0:58:38] <Tisaric> the factory must grow
[0:58:39] <%Broand> use different recipes?
[0:58:39] <%holydeviant1> Get hard drives for even MORE EFFICIENCY
[0:58:40] <CappuccinoGuil> Have you found Hard Drives yet?
[0:58:41] <%blastyoboots> explore for weird locations, do weird shit, wait for updates, and M O D S
[0:58:42] <%PinkSuprende> Whats left to do is wait for the story mode and campaign in 2040
[0:58:42] <OwlLightningMage> Play another game
[0:58:43] <%texaporte> define a "full game"
[0:58:45] <abelincoln_catpuncher> become as gods?
[0:58:45] <%PanicSwytch> Pump the planet dry
[0:58:46] <rReizs> make more storeys
[0:58:46] <%notsoy> hard drives unlock variant recipes for existing items, they're neat
[0:58:47] <%hat_under_bread> Make the pipe cannon that ends the universe.
[0:58:48] <+ccwettr123> you could always just make crazy stuff
[0:58:50] <+PenmanLupine> Do it better and faster until more updates/mods do things
[0:58:55] <%atteroproxy> wtf
[0:58:56] <%shruke> theres lots of cool world to explore I guess

[0:59:37] <CappuccinoGuil> Why are you still using MK 1 belts?
[0:59:40] <%BoxNavy> :)
[0:59:42] <+BigCoffee> or just belts and smelting
[0:59:45] <%blastyoboots> Pat have you seen the truth of Stackable Supports? all hail the Stackables, you can even stack multiple Pipelines and Hypertubes atop the Stackables
[0:59:45] <rafaelba93> belts are easier
[0:59:45] <%honeyman18> Real men build vertical, also looks fine
[0:59:46] <$stoptaknall> @PatStaresAt explore theirs a bunch bios and you get hardrives also the red forest it know as the end game area
[0:59:55] <CappuccinoGuil> @sonofthedeepsouth it's space, OSHA has no power here
[0:59:55] <%Nested_Dreams> After elevator stage 3 it says "Not available in early access", so something elevator related will come
[1:00:00] <%ChestMimik> @sonofthedeepsouth OSHA CAN"T REACH US IN SPACE
[1:00:04] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[1:00:05] <Doofmaster> pretty decent for 20h tbh
[1:00:16] <segychan> god i love this game
[1:00:31] <%Xelhesia> thats really impressive
[1:00:35] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> I love that you name your saves. Mine are all "asdasdasd" or "adawsdqaw"
[1:00:44] <sonofthedeepsouth> stick
[1:00:45] <+ReallyBigRocks> slide jump tho
[1:00:46] <%BoxNavy> blade runner... like the movie :O
[1:00:48] <sonofthedeepsouth> I get it
[1:00:49] <+ReallyBigRocks> slide jump everywhere
[1:00:49] <iosephe> find nut
[1:00:52] <%atteroproxy> Pat, you played the game off stream and I was learning along with you. So I now have no idea what you're talking about.
[1:00:54] <%blastyoboots> Find NUT
[1:00:54] <sonofthedeepsouth> bladerunner I gt it
[1:00:59] <$stoptaknall> @PatStaresAt did you find alt recipes?
[1:01:01] <%Mendin> 20 and 30 hours. He started playing this a week and a half ago
[1:01:06] <%Jekado> the upgraded gun still sucks
[1:01:07] <%honeyman18> The sliding reminds me of Mirror's Edge
[1:01:08] <%Jekado> but sucks less
[1:01:09] <%ThirdWelles> Sorry, slugs?
[1:01:12] <krymzen5> so things can kill u?
[1:01:13] <sonofthedeepsouth> gu
[1:01:13] <%holydeviant1> Rebar gun is dogshit, the rifle is okay
[1:01:17] <%jarednotwithsubway> its basically a steampunk bow and arrow
[1:01:21] <%BoxNavy> that things cool i like the keychain
[1:01:22] <%Jekado> you can grind them into power boosts
[1:01:23] <%ThirdWelles> YO does that just shoot rebar?
[1:01:29] <%Nested_Dreams> KEYBLADE
[1:01:32] <rReizs> things can kill you but you just respawn at your hub
[1:01:32] <Overloard> ey but it claps doggos tho
[1:01:37] <CappuccinoGuil> Still need to find Yellow Slugs, though
[1:01:37] <%ChestMimik> @krymzen5 It's not as common as factorio but yes there's hostile mobs
[1:01:37] <%TheBobulus> better gun needs oil
[1:01:37] <%Jekado> @ThirdWelles yes
[1:01:40] <Top_Lane_Duelist> yeah you want the next gun
[1:01:41] <Doofmaster> overclocking does reduce power efficiency though
[1:01:43] <Djinnazz> what...?
[1:01:44] <%ThirdWelles> So upgrade bugs?
[1:01:45] <%coreyyotto> *phrasing
[1:01:51] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Good plan to overcharge your miners first, yeah
[1:01:54] <wangus1492> PHRASING
[1:02:00] <KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt Your relationship with this game is a bit weird, I thought you dropped it, but now you love it?
[1:02:05] <+camnjb> Much futher than I got in around the same time been fighting mind goblins to keep things at right angles and balance my system to perfectly delievering the right amount of items per minute
[1:02:05] <%linSP> yeah i heard pat say something about putting things into WHAT now
[1:02:10] <%tank7013> @krymzen5 There's alien creatures around most resource nodes and throughout the map. Also poison gas and radiation
[1:02:20] <%ThirdWelles> Nice
[1:02:23] <%ThirdWelles> Succ tube
[1:02:25] <krymzen5> @ChestMimik  neat. yeah i'm much more familiar with factorio, but this looks super cool
[1:02:26] <%holydeviant1> Oh my gosh that's a big base
[1:02:31] <LVL1_Scumbag> Is there any way to label the tubes?
[1:02:32] <%atteroproxy> @Mendin I put 2 months of playtime into FF14 over 7 months, you lose track when you're enjoying yourself
[1:02:34] <CappuccinoGuil> @ThirdWelles each core unlocks 25% overclocking. However, the upgrade also increases energy consumption
[1:02:38] <%BoxNavy> :O
[1:02:44] <%Jekado> @holydeviant1 not really....
[1:02:44] <sonofthedeepsouth> nice
[1:02:50] <+koriar> There's apparently already a new calculator out for the new ratios
[1:02:51] <%ThirdWelles> ah, so SPEED bugs
[1:02:51] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> oh yeah, looking at this, moving bases must be a nightmare
[1:03:00] <%honeyman18> good vertical slices
[1:03:01] <krymzen5> love how free form the building looks
[1:03:10] <%UltraViolet371> this is nicely organized
[1:03:11] <Overloard> yooooo sbfpYeyeye sbfpYeyeye
[1:03:12] <%putnampuppeteer> God, can you imagine puking in a hyper tube
[1:03:14] <%ThirdWelles> Funny that the slugs make things go faster
[1:03:16] <%Mendin> @KosOrSomeSayKosm_ Yes but also 100% deconstruction
[1:03:23] <%ThirdWelles> That's a nice little irony
[1:03:28] <%Jekado> there gets to be a point where you make so much base you don't remember building most of it
[1:03:37] <%californaya> Industry!
[1:03:50] <%BoxNavy> coal do be goin in üò≥
[1:03:50] <televisedrevolting> Feels like my elementary school factory field trip.
[1:04:06] <$stoptaknall> @PatStaresAt oh you are using the overflow  method
[1:04:52] <%YakumoYomi> My mind...!!!NotLikeThis
[1:04:53] <%TheBobulus> pat,  fyi, splitters stack
[1:04:57] <amiavamp> Expand this into multiple belts and you get a main bus going
[1:05:00] <+ExclusivelyPlastic> Why didn't you rotate those splitters so the inputs/outputs are in a straight line?
[1:05:03] <%Mendin> What tier's the hoverpack Pat
[1:05:04] <%ThirdWelles> Need that rocket pack
[1:05:14] <+ReallyBigRocks> Why make the conveyors come out the back of the splitter tho? Straight lines?
[1:05:15] <%atteroproxy> It's like when I got to visit the milk farms
[1:05:16] <%ChestMimik> Oh, so THATS how overflow works here
[1:05:18] <T_Sasquatch> Pat sounds insane
[1:05:32] <%BoxNavy> shout outs to the viewers who know whats going on i dont know how you do it
[1:05:41] <%rumtumtugnutz> 225
[1:05:46] <%BubbaRands> Yeah, my brain too caveman for this but i'm interested LUL
[1:05:46] <%holydeviant1> I'm picturing an engineer talking to his CEO, who is nodding along but thinking "oh god I don't understand"
[1:05:50] <amiavamp> An overlay that tells you how fast the belts are moving would be great
[1:05:51] <krymzen5> i see, thats an interesting way to handle overflow
[1:05:53] <%YakumoYomi> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[1:06:00] <dapperskeleton69> !uptime
[1:06:00] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 6m.
[1:06:06] <%honeyman18> nice
[1:06:15] <%BoxNavy> engineers in the chat are going insane
[1:06:17] <%PanicSwytch> Honestly I would give up and shelf this game if i had to do this
[1:06:22] <%BoxNavy> theyre pogging out of their jeans
[1:06:23] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Underclock it
[1:06:26] <$stoptaknall> @PatStaresAt you make a tube cannon yet? with multi entrance one after anther ? it makes you go super fast
[1:06:26] <%coreyyotto> something something jet fuel
[1:06:28] <+ashgray2520> ashgray2520 subscribed with Prime. 
[1:06:30] <+AugmentedMadman> Pat the Foreman
[1:06:33] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Pat, click on the efficiency percent on a machine
[1:06:34] <%bevyrage> yo is that a cyber katana?
[1:06:35] <%ChestMimik> @BoxNavy EngieChamp
[1:06:35] <muniea5> be prepared to replace all of this when you get alt recipes
[1:06:46] <+OhioNitsud> can you melt the steel beams?
[1:06:59] <%ThirdWelles> This is fun
[1:07:00] <%ThirdWelles> I like this
[1:07:06] <%blastyoboots> @bevyrage it's actually three cattle prods screwed together
[1:07:09] <%honeyman18> important feature for your indoor factories has been added as well
[1:07:14] <%bevyrage> damn this is very clean
[1:07:15] <%jarednotwithsubway> looks great!
[1:07:16] <%notsoy> the tickets from the sink let you buy ladders, special ramps, walls, and other super rad shit
[1:07:19] <amiavamp> need copy paste so these clean builds don't get thrown in the trash later
[1:07:21] <Slimeking_Mike> Ye loox nice
[1:07:22] <+FlappySeal_> Did Pat ever get around to Factorio? I remember in mentioned in a CSB
[1:07:26] <CatsDrunkonCopper> you can just stack the splitters
[1:07:27] <%bevyrage> @blastyoboots damn, that's a dumb idea and i approve of it
[1:07:30] <Doofmaster> ngl I usually just clip the conveyors instead of going vertical lol
[1:07:31] <HipHopAnonymous23> this is not the type of game I would expect Pat to be into
[1:07:31] <%ThirdWelles> Some guy said you can stack splitters on top of each other?
[1:07:34] <+ExclusivelyPlastic> Might have to steal that design although it does take up a lot of space
[1:07:34] <ScreamLord> rebar?
[1:07:40] <$stoptaknall> @PatStaresAt you make a tube cannon yet? with multi entrance one after anther ? it makes you go super fast
[1:07:50] <%jarednotwithsubway> yeah you super can
[1:07:57] <%jarednotwithsubway> NICE
[1:08:00] <%putnampuppeteer> LUL
[1:08:01] <%ChestMimik> OSHA can suck it
[1:08:03] <%holydeviant1> Gotta put in some suicide nets
[1:08:05] <%Broand> You can dynamite those gassy crabs btw
[1:08:09] <dexdestroyazz> ANyone know if theyve added any use for the mercer sphears and junk yet?
[1:08:12] <sonofthedeepsouth> OSHA hates it
[1:08:13] <%notsoy> the blade runners reduce fall damage, which is neat
[1:08:17] <OwlLightningMage> OSHA is crying right now
[1:08:18] <amiavamp> bioshock infinite tech
[1:08:22] <%asgard147> limesPoggers
[1:08:23] <CappuccinoGuil> DEATH STRANDING! PogChamp
[1:08:23] <%blastyoboots> holy shit!!
[1:08:27] <%holydeviant1> Yoooooo!
[1:08:28] <Tisaric> holy shit that's such a good add
[1:08:29] <+vaderxyz1970> Someone played Death Stranding
[1:08:30] <%jarednotwithsubway> super sick
[1:08:30] <+ReallyBigRocks> Bioshock'n it
[1:08:30] <krymzen5> thats just cool LUL
[1:08:31] <%coreyyotto> there is no OSHA in space
[1:08:32] <%BoxNavy> call osha its crying
[1:08:32] <%TheBobulus> I stack splitters and delete the bottom ones to make floating splitters
[1:08:37] <%ThirdWelles> oh that's rad as fuck
[1:08:37] <%brickwall35> we Titanfall now
[1:08:37] <nukle0nik> will this ever go on sale
[1:08:37] <%Mendin> woo  bridges
[1:08:38] <+Strigiform> I get slowed down building walkways around my machines so I can stare at them
[1:08:39] <%ThirdWelles> This game is great
[1:08:40] <TOONFOOD> that's awesome
[1:08:41] <%PanicSwytch> Show your Kay Tana
[1:08:42] <Tisaric> that's so fucking useful
[1:08:46] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Neat!
[1:08:46] <%honeyman18> nuts
[1:08:49] <KasiCrafter> Hey wait, that's just a Death Stranding.
[1:08:53] <+allups> can u zip to it from the ground or do u have to jump on it
[1:08:53] <Doofmaster> TIL nuts are just shitty berries
[1:08:54] <%DrBunni> I can't believe people saw how much you loved the building of death stranding and thought this game would break you.
[1:08:58] <%Giggalith> Have you had any AdMech moments yet?
[1:09:10] <+ExclusivelyPlastic> Wait how do you rotate pipe intersections to be vertical?
[1:09:13] <%bevyrage> is your coal production following the COAL PROTOCOL? :D
[1:09:16] <%atteroproxy> Here's the industrial nightmare
[1:09:23] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Consider water towers for your coal production.
[1:09:36] <%UltraViolet371> oh they added proper snapping to water extractors so you can make those line up nicer
[1:09:36] <$stoptaknall> @PatStaresAt you make a tube cannon yet? with multi entrance one after anther ? it makes you go super fast
[1:09:37] <%Jekado> yeah super helpful
[1:09:41] <+ExclusivelyPlastic> How did I never know this
[1:09:41] <%sweetestbeefs> that's pretty rad
[1:09:49] <%blastyoboots> I'm sorry what do you meant WATER TOWERS
[1:10:01] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt GET CONVEYER WALLS
[1:10:04] <%ThirdWelles> Not knowing that seems like a remarkable oversight. Not gonna lie
[1:10:06] <amiavamp> concrete is my go-to for dumping into the sink
[1:10:09] <%blastyoboots> get some of your first tickets
[1:10:12] <%honeyman18> whatever gets you glass for shinys
[1:10:15] <%TheBobulus> MAM research?
[1:10:15] <%Broand> I just put whatever heatsinks or whatever I find by exploring
[1:10:15] <krymzen5> i love these tubes man LUL
[1:10:16] <+MassConnect> awesome dishes?
[1:10:16] <%Mendin> They made water towers too on top of the battery towers?
[1:10:16] <Doofmaster> typically, more advanced/dense parts are more efficient for the awesome sink
[1:10:17] <+AugmentedMadman> Man, I dropped out of Engineering to avoid doing this kind of stuff. And you're doing it for fun.
[1:10:20] <rReizs> walls and wall outlets
[1:10:21] <LVL1_Scumbag> weeeeeeeeee
[1:10:21] <%blastyoboots> on stream~
[1:10:22] <%greasypete00> i love these futurama tubes
[1:10:24] <Top_Lane_Duelist> omg ive been trying to find out how to dfo that for so long
[1:10:25] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Gravity works on water. If your water reservoir is up high, you don't need pumps to have it flow to a lower point.
[1:10:26] <%brickwall35> does this production affect the environment? can you have a eco-friendly or planet crippling build?
[1:10:26] <%sweetestbeefs> yo he ZOOMIN
[1:10:28] <%PanicSwytch> LUL LUL
[1:10:29] <Calek> zoomin around at the speed of sound
[1:10:29] <%ThirdWelles> spoede
[1:10:29] <+koriar> Was this Dune Desert or Rocky Desert?
[1:10:29] <garbageheaphound> wow
[1:10:32] <Doofmaster> awesome sink really likes project assembly parts
[1:10:33] <+queaks> this game is so pretty
[1:10:34] <ScreamLord> Futurama Intensifies
[1:10:34] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt have you done much MAM research?
[1:10:41] <$stoptaknall> @PatStaresAt you make a tube cannon yet? with multi entrance one after anther ? it makes you go super fast
[1:10:47] <OwlLightningMage> Pat is a zoomer
[1:10:48] <CappuccinoGuil> @brickwall35 no, it doesn't matter. Resources are infinite
[1:10:49] <+rbakervv> @brickwall35 pollution is not a thing in this game
[1:10:50] <%honeyman18> Jetsons, or Futurama?
[1:10:53] <%TheBobulus> aka gold
[1:10:55] <%Jekado> if he has caterium he should have MAM
[1:10:57] <%Nested_Dreams> anything that you know backfills and stops flowing, AI splitters are the best since you can set them to overflow
[1:10:59] <Draco_Renegade> Why do I find this relaxing?
[1:11:00] <Doofmaster> (caterium is basically gold)
[1:11:00] <+ChaosAethr> is that OSHA approved?
[1:11:05] <%brickwall35> @rbakervv damn
[1:11:06] <%ThirdWelles> from the "Caterium Get" save
[1:11:07] <+camnjb> I put outputs slower than iputs on item storage to awesome sink seems to work fine
[1:11:08] <%Mendin> psaElmo erium
[1:11:09] <sonofthedeepsouth> earth hates it
[1:11:12] <amiavamp> have you unlocked the map yet?
[1:11:22] <%ThirdWelles> It appears to have halted...
[1:11:25] <%BoxNavy> :)
[1:11:30] <%blastyoboots> you can't use much Caterium early on Pat, so I like piping all the extra quickwire into the sink!!!!!!
[1:11:35] <%blastyoboots> make a sink
[1:11:35] <%ThirdWelles> RIP
[1:11:36] <krymzen5> this world seems huge
[1:11:37] <%ChestMimik> Sell it
[1:11:38] <%MistyMntns> Quickwire is for level 2 power I think
[1:11:39] <%Broand> I use quickwire with alt recipes
[1:11:41] <%notsoy> this is an example of something you should use the sink for
[1:11:41] <Why_So_British> cat wire into sink
[1:11:41] <%BoxNavy> this is fine :)
[1:11:42] <KShirahama> then throw it into SINK
[1:11:47] <%MistyMntns> NO DONT
[1:11:48] <+queaks> what's your current milestone pat?
[1:11:48] <$HyperionXV> @PatStaresAt Did you research and make the exoskeleton legs?
[1:11:51] <Doofmaster> so much quickwire, some alt recipes use them
[1:11:52] <+HebbieJebbies> Is this one of your happy places?
[1:11:53] <+Strigiform> I like shoving rare stuff I dont have a use for into awesome sink as well
[1:11:54] <%tank7013> Rushing caterium research is amazing just for Mark 2 power poles alone
[1:11:56] <%notsoy> use a lower-grade belt going out, so you stay high on capacity
[1:11:56] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Have you tried throwing a ticket into the sink?
[1:11:58] <$stoptaknall> @PatStaresAt you make a tube cannon yet? with multi entrance one after anther ? it makes you go super fast
[1:11:58] <amiavamp> need a "mall" to grab building materials from
[1:12:01] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Go Pat bilb da ting
[1:12:02] <%ThirdWelles> hey so what the fuck is an awsome sink
[1:12:06] <%Jekado> you can set overflows to the sink it really helps
[1:12:06] <%honeyman18> This is why I just made the super hub for all resources
[1:12:10] <%ThirdWelles> awesome*
[1:12:11] <%Nested_Dreams> Just the overflow into the sink
[1:12:17] <+blastazoid00> Weeeeeee
[1:12:17] <+Nemesisnick33> stack a bunch of transport tubes in a row to make a man cannon PogChamp
[1:12:19] <%Jekado> Pat how is your power usage so far?
[1:12:19] <%Mendin> Are zoomtubes mono or bidirectional
[1:12:23] <%PanicSwytch> How do u win?
[1:12:25] <%TheBobulus> @patstaresat MAM research?
[1:12:39] <%Jekado> @PanicSwytch use all the resources
[1:12:41] <OwlLightningMage> How do you win? LUL
[1:12:44] <CappuccinoGuil> MAM research is important
[1:12:47] <+BigCoffee> @PanicSwytch tech a rocket and escape
[1:12:51] <+blastazoid00> Go in the Futurama tubes again
[1:12:51] <%tank7013> @ThirdWelles You can feed it extra resources to get a currency to buy stuff from the awesome shop
[1:12:52] <%blastyoboots> Caterium will eventually get you a smart splitter that you can configure to ONLY send overflow to the sink and nothing else, instead of just doing a poor-man's overflow control with a normal splitter in front of the storage
[1:12:55] <%BubbaRands> Win?
[1:12:56] <OwlLightningMage> What is the end of this game?
[1:12:57] <%ThirdWelles> @OwlLightningMage Feed the pace elevator
[1:12:59] <%UltraViolet371> catwalks are the shit, can't live without them now
[1:13:02] <%blastyoboots> yea how's your MAM research
[1:13:03] <%ThirdWelles> space*
[1:13:05] <%MistyMntns> Quickwire is used for oil fun things
[1:13:07] <%Ascethetic> @owllightningmage you don't win, you just do a little better each time
[1:13:12] <+ReallyBigRocks> There is no end
[1:13:13] <%honeyman18> plates on line pat
[1:13:13] <+queaks> plate blocking
[1:13:13] <%BubbaRands> End?
[1:13:17] <%ThirdWelles> @OwlLightningMage And make it go faster
[1:13:18] <muniea5> oh man you NEED the screw alt recipe
[1:13:18] <+BigCoffee> @OwlLightningMage Escaping the planet with a space rocket
[1:13:19] <amiavamp> oh no
[1:13:19] <Doofmaster> I saw a plate or two clogging the belts
[1:13:20] <%brickwall35> @panicswytch by creating economies of scale that allow you to price out your competitors
[1:13:21] <bevyrage> the higher quality the materials you put into the awesome shop the more points you get towards coupons btw. those wires you got nothing to put 'em into? dump 'em into the shop!
[1:13:21] <zazzera01> oops
[1:13:23] <%ChestMimik> THE SYSTEM IS TAINTED
[1:13:25] <CappuccinoGuil> @OwlLightningMage it's in Early Access so you don't win yet, but the goal is to send all the required materials up the Space Elevator.
[1:13:25] <%Broand> pffft
[1:13:26] <%TheWinged7> LUL
[1:13:26] <%putnampuppeteer> oh NO
[1:13:27] <%honeyman18> have to delete line
[1:13:29] <sonofthedeepsouth> its dead
[1:13:30] <+ChaosAethr> is gief sleeping?
[1:13:32] <%CalderGaming> the fatty pig dog is outputting snores at maximum efficiency
[1:13:33] <%blastyoboots> oh i HATE it when that happens
[1:13:33] <Top_Lane_Duelist> have you found hard drives yet
[1:13:34] <amiavamp> burn it all down now
[1:13:37] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Heheh YEAH you are
[1:13:38] <Doofmaster> presumably one of your assemblers has the wrong recipe downstairs
[1:13:38] <%ThirdWelles> uh oh
[1:13:39] <%notsoy> LMAO
[1:13:40] <%Xelhesia> uh oh
[1:13:42] <%CalderGaming> IMPACTED ROD SYNDROME
[1:13:43] <%ThirdWelles> UH OH
[1:13:44] <+Nemesisnick33> rekd LUL
[1:13:45] <OwlLightningMage> START ALL OVER
[1:13:48] <amiavamp> at least it's not factorio where changing your armor makes you dump 100000 items
[1:13:52] <%sweetestbeefs> @PatStaresAt so I got Hardspace: Shipbreaker after watching your stream of it the other day, and I'm really loving it so far, Thanks for showing me that space banjo blue collar work is the best
[1:13:55] <%ChestMimik> BURN IT DOWN
[1:13:59] <OwlLightningMage> SAVE FILE IS RUINED
[1:14:00] <+allups> is that ur dog or my game
[1:14:01] <%blastyoboots> your rod's backed up
[1:14:02] <%honeyman18> You hate to see it
[1:14:05] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt once you get more alternate recipes, you can just turn iron ingots into screws
[1:14:08] <$stoptaknall> @PatStaresAt ugh screws find enough alt recpices you can rid of screw completely
[1:14:16] <%putnampuppeteer> big snore for big boy
[1:14:18] <%Xelhesia> giefy snore
[1:14:18] <Top_Lane_Duelist> uh oh spaghettio
[1:14:28] <Manwad> Blessed be the omnissiah!
[1:14:28] <%MistyMntns> @PatStaresAt wait until you get the smart splitter
[1:14:29] <xbb1024> hello again
[1:14:34] <+ReallyBigRocks> screws are the fucking worst
[1:14:36] <%BubbaRands> Science is fun 4Head
[1:14:38] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Gib Rod LUL
[1:14:44] <%honeyman18> get a ladder nerd
[1:14:44] <xbb1024> what tier is Pat?
[1:14:45] <%ChestMimik> That Jetpack is going to kill Pat
[1:14:49] <%Nested_Dreams> @legendfather_of_giants Casted Screws make me woolieGASM
[1:14:50] <+allups> i thought gief was a Skyrim horse
[1:14:57] <rReizs> yeah i got to work on my factory's verticality, this is a lot cleaner
[1:15:04] <%notsoy> i think jetpack is in the next tier for him
[1:15:11] <oniwahoo> I-ron is my favorite pokemon
[1:15:20] <OwlLightningMage> He was saying iron right for a while this time
[1:15:26] <%honeyman18> @Nested_Dreams they were my favorite alt
[1:15:28] <%PinkertonDanPie> I just popped in and I am so lost
[1:15:28] <%PanicSwytch> Why no modular frame?
[1:15:30] <+Wakka66> So is this just 3D Factorio?
[1:15:36] <%Mendin> Gief snoring bigtime
[1:15:39] <%sweetestbeefs> My favorite will smith movie, I-Ron
[1:15:40] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> I wouldn't mind an RTS build view for this game. Make factorio mode a milestone.
[1:15:41] <%TamsynRRD> @PatStaresAt You don't have to delete a conveyor belt to upgrade it.  Higher tier belts will overwrite lower tier and you WILL get the materials for the lower tier belts back.
[1:15:48] <+allups> tbh this is everything i dont like about these games
[1:15:51] <%PinkertonDanPie> so much has happened but the pat is happy. 10/10
[1:15:51] <ape_hawk> hey pat, hows the crack?
[1:15:57] <+queaks> you will... omg you will
[1:15:59] <+allups> where is the creative shit
[1:16:00] <+Nemesisnick33> did they change PogChamp !?!?
[1:16:00] <%Broand> I have a modded game and none of them have updated so I probably have to start afresh
[1:16:04] <+Nemesisnick33> NotLikeThis
[1:16:07] <garbageheaphound> is that zangief whining?
[1:16:12] <%GarbageQueenEllie> I will only buy this game if you can build a Chocolate Factory in it
[1:16:15] <%Nested_Dreams> I'd point to the ships, but I don't know the locationa for this start
[1:16:18] <$stoptaknall> @PatStaresAt you make a tube cannon yet? with multi entrance one after anther ? it makes you go super fast
[1:16:24] <zazzera01> sounds like snoring
[1:16:25] <%sweetestbeefs> lmao your gun is clipping
[1:16:26] <%fakeburg> @garbageheaphound He snoring
[1:16:26] <%weissguard> PogChamp
[1:16:29] <%PinkertonDanPie> CONK CRETE
[1:16:32] <%putnampuppeteer> konk reeet
[1:16:37] <+rbakervv> @garbageheaphound oh god yes, he's a loud boy
[1:16:38] <%Broand> Is it not mindblowing that machines and conveyorbelts seem to work across any distance?
[1:16:43] <+ExclusivelyPlastic> I wish they would fix the offset equipment in hypertube bug
[1:16:43] <%PinkertonDanPie> FUNK YEA CONK CRETE
[1:16:46] <+Wakka66> I really do wish I could get into Factorio, bought it to support the devs, but seems like something I'd have to commit to, but not sure if I'd be able to.
[1:16:48] <muniea5> you can use the belt supports to make makeshift ladders
[1:16:50] <%MuffledEurobeat> TUUUUUBBBEEEESSSSSSS
[1:16:59] <%W1nterTitan> yeah scaffies
[1:16:59] <+hrudzie_1> pat what have you done
[1:17:04] <amiavamp> all the way in another biome lol
[1:17:07] <+D00msDayDan> COOOOAAAAAL
[1:17:09] <oniwahoo> @garbageheaphound You asked that right as one of my cats started whining and I almost @d to apologize for Elsie
[1:17:12] <averageancom> yo Pat, fun fact. I make screws for a profession. I'm a CNC machinist. you can actually automate that process in real life by feeding rods into a machine. it's super complex but we do it.
[1:17:13] <$stoptaknall> @PatStaresAt you make a tube cannon yet? with multi entrance one after anther ? it makes you go super fast
[1:17:15] <cochramd1992> amazing
[1:17:19] <+RowenCleric> samus aran gonna love all these tubes
[1:17:20] <Doofmaster> this is the lategame area :o
[1:17:24] <@SoFarFetched> @stoptaknall Dont spam questions
[1:17:24] <ape_hawk> pat. are you okay?
[1:17:27] <+TheCrispyBoi> yo that's sick
[1:17:35] <%GarbageQueenEllie> These mechanisms look really clean. I like that.
[1:17:41] <%MistyMntns> @PatStaresAt what teir are you at?
[1:17:41] <%ChestMimik> @Wakka66 mostly just time. The game has different ways to play like a godmode and sandbox settings
[1:17:47] <%putnampuppeteer> YEYEYE
[1:17:52] <%californaya> TUBIN' AROUND AT THE SPEED OF SOUND
[1:17:57] <+ReallyBigRocks> Yeah you can use that to fucking launch yourself
[1:17:59] <+Robo_Wizard1> Have you built a hypertube hyper cannon yet?
[1:18:03] <%blastyoboots> yes you can reverse direction in tubes
[1:18:09] <$SGrim> @averageancom I had no idea the command and conquer franchise made enough money to break into the trades! Cool!
[1:18:18] <sonofthedeepsouth> If nature didn't want to lose why did it create us? Gotcha Enviromentalists Kappa
[1:18:21] <Doofmaster> if you play multiplayer you can trap an AFK player in a closed hypertube loop LUL
[1:18:28] <cochramd1992> this is some Dr Seuss shit
[1:18:31] <%PanicSwytch> So u been playing Pat the Foreman at 5:36am
[1:18:32] <%Rumbutt> You need to get some Sonic music playing while you go through those tubes
[1:18:35] <%Jekado> in co op make sure the tube you use isn't being used by someone from the other side....
[1:18:47] <+thegreenbenis> Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
[1:18:48] <OwlLightningMage> Pat the builder
[1:18:51] <%blastyoboots> @cochramd1992  XD OH MAN YEAH
[1:18:57] <%Ascethetic> @jekado how is the co-op?
[1:19:04] <+b_aleph> is the update satisfactory?
[1:19:06] <%Ziegsy> if you guys like this, theres a outuber that focuses on doing crazy shit in this game
[1:19:10] <%ChestMimik> Flood the economy with quickwire
[1:19:11] <+thegreenbenis> Yo, nice industrial hell scape.
[1:19:13] <%BoxNavy> human transport tubes will be real in 2021
[1:19:25] <cochramd1992> is that gold
[1:19:29] <%ChestMimik> @Ziegsy I follow a few but I'm down for more
[1:19:30] <%blastyoboots> just splitter right before the storage
[1:19:34] <Doofmaster> the correct answer is "a silly amount"
[1:19:36] <%Jekado> @Ascethetic terrible but still functional the non host lag makes the game problematic
[1:19:43] <%TheBobulus> 270?
[1:19:57] <zazzera01> when you get smart splitters you can automatically feed overflow items into a sink
[1:19:59] <+Nemesisnick33> quick wire more like quick math Pog
[1:19:59] <%Jekado> yeah i don't know why its at 270
[1:20:01] <oniwahoo> It's a beautiful sight
[1:20:02] <amiavamp> feed
[1:20:08] <%sweetestbeefs> what does the sink do?
[1:20:09] <%GarbageQueenEllie> This is relaxing
[1:20:09] <$stoptaknall> you'll need the quick wire once you start getting into making computers
[1:20:12] <%blastyoboots> check your tickets
[1:20:13] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt What does the Awesome Sink do?
[1:20:15] <garbageheaphound> whats a sink do
[1:20:16] <%Mendin> What does thhat DO?
[1:20:16] <%Ascethetic> @jekado so what you're saying is wait til they fix it to play woth others
[1:20:17] <%putnampuppeteer> V O R E
[1:20:18] <%notsoy> did you get the wall sockets yet? that shit is SUPER good
[1:20:20] <%Jekado> 60 120 270? 480 and 720 for belt speeds i think
[1:20:20] <%BoxNavy> qupons
[1:20:21] <xbb1024> you can create a storage stack
[1:20:22] <%blastyoboots> GROUPONS
[1:20:22] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> crypto?
[1:20:26] <OwlLightningMage> Oh no... It's eats more than Gief...
[1:20:26] <+gamemassacre1> what does the sink do sorry not played this
[1:20:28] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Feed it a ticket?
[1:20:30] <%holydeviant1> The sink makes a currency for the corpo shop
[1:20:44] <GunEden> buy the mini cart
[1:20:45] <+ReallyBigRocks> Awesome sink gives you tickets to buy certain upgrades
[1:20:47] <%Broand> Walls and wall sockets are super useful though?
[1:20:51] <+queaks> you dump anything into it
[1:20:54] <Dommykins> Did you use that caterium to get Blade Runners yet?
[1:20:56] <amiavamp> sink is a place to put all your extra crap that you would just otherwise delete since resources are infinite
[1:21:02] <rReizs> awesome sink is like a resource dump for recipes like wall outlets or walls with conveyor holes
[1:21:02] <$SGrim> Buy the microcar PogChamp
[1:21:03] <+Robo_Wizard1> sloped foundations are absolutely critical
[1:21:05] <%Jekado> @Ascethetic has a non host you can't use cars and fighting is laggy as shit.  so if you stay at the base to just build you are fine but yeah if you want the FULL expericence just wait.
[1:21:06] <%blastyoboots> wall sockets are like mini-power-poles that are horizontal
[1:21:10] <%sweetestbeefs> zooom
[1:21:13] <DaKnightWarrior> This is really cool.
[1:21:15] <+ReallyBigRocks> It's like fake microtransactions for laughs
[1:21:17] <%Ascethetic> @patstaresat for someone who doesn't like Metroi, you sure have alot of TUUUUBES
[1:21:21] <+GETSUM04> Yo I‚Äôm surprised how stable this release is
[1:21:25] <%BoxNavy> conk create
[1:21:35] <%MistyMntns> @SGrim Nah Buy the Cybertruck
[1:21:36] <%MelBrooksKA> @Jekado You can tweak some ini files to make it much better
[1:21:44] <oniwahoo> Organized to a satisfactory degree
[1:21:53] <%BoxNavy> moon2W
[1:21:53] <garbageheaphound> damn
[1:21:54] <$stoptaknall> @PatStaresAt  oh you can unlock a secret by sinking one ticket
[1:21:59] <OwlLightningMage> A Aron
[1:21:59] <%ChestMimik> Did you name your mobs?
[1:22:07] <amiavamp> out in zerg territory
[1:22:08] <%ClericOfSparda> Dafuq?
[1:22:16] <%Jekado> @MelBrooksKA oh i didn't know that i'll tell my friend when we move to experimental since we stopped because of the update was coming out.
[1:22:19] <oniwahoo> Those are straight up the futurama tubes, huh
[1:22:19] <amiavamp> your cousin lester gonna tell you about seeing a zergling
[1:22:20] <%blastyoboots> The MOST USEFUL THING you can buy at the awesome shop is the pack that includes DOUBLE SIDED RAMPS, makes constructing foundation up to places cost half the concrete it would
[1:22:23] <$stoptaknall> oh hey it's the other starting area
[1:22:28] <CappuccinoGuil> Did you get a lizard doggo yet?
[1:22:33] <%Shackle_Rustyford> lmao this is the 3rd starting area
[1:22:35] <%UltraViolet371> well we can't just leave resources untapped
[1:22:37] <KasiCrafter> Wow, nice Minecraft base tour, Pat! Where can we get the world download? Kappa
[1:22:40] <%Ascethetic> @jekado some friends and I were thinking about playing thos after we were done with Valheim, thanks for the heads up, my dude
[1:22:45] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Oh oxidized
[1:22:46] <$metzselaar> This is where my main base is
[1:22:50] <ScreamLord> I think the next update needs teleporters Jesus
[1:22:54] <+BettyMwwaahh> doodHokey
[1:22:56] <%BoxNavy> whats the space elevator for
[1:23:00] <%BoxNavy> to go to space?
[1:23:05] <NenaFan101> Gotta aim big
[1:23:05] <%sweetestbeefs> TALL BOY
[1:23:08] <amiavamp> space elevator unlocks new tech
[1:23:11] <+thegreenbenis> Nice hellscape fam.
[1:23:12] <%MelBrooksKA> @Jekado I can send you the wiki page my friend sent me on Discord if you want for what ini files to edit
[1:23:13] <+D00msDayDan> the space elevator is for unlocking the next tier of research
[1:23:15] <%ChestMimik> @BoxNavy You need it to unlock higher tiers
[1:23:18] <%Ascethetic> Pat, i think you need more tubes tbh
[1:23:20] <%holydeviant1> I need to check if trains are faster than toobs
[1:23:22] <+ReallyBigRocks> @BoxNavy It's to unlock tech tiers
[1:23:24] <Doofmaster> more like modular FUNK
[1:23:24] <+Nemesisnick33> chat teach pat how he can make the tubes faster
[1:23:25] <$stoptaknall> @PatStaresAt have you started exploring the map yet?
[1:23:26] <%Jekado> @BoxNavy unlocks milestones for tech levels
[1:23:28] <%Broand> I picked northern forest which is the WORST for building wide because there's absolutely no space but great resources
[1:23:29] <cochramd1992> tuuuuuuuuuuuuubes
[1:23:32] <OwlLightningMage> Has this entire stream been Pat explaining and making zero progress?
[1:23:35] <%TheBobulus> how's the mam research coming?
[1:23:37] <+b_aleph> I got a query for your modular frame
[1:23:37] <%BoxNavy> so you dont ride the elevator? to space?
[1:23:41] <OwlLightningMage> I can't telk
[1:23:44] <+Jekado> @MelBrooksKA yeah sure since i'm in PSA discord
[1:23:45] <DaKnightWarrior> The tubes are fun to watch.
[1:23:46] <%blastyoboots> BTW pat all the awesome sinks are linked so you can print your all your tickets from any of them
[1:23:49] <+b_aleph> I like the size of your modular frame
[1:23:52] <+ExclusivelyPlastic> I recently spent about a week and a half straight just making a modular frame plant that outputs 30/min
[1:23:56] <+DoctorHam> I am prepared for pat's life to end with the hypertube cannon lol
[1:23:58] <$stoptaknall> nope
[1:23:59] <CrematedCube> Rollercoaster logic right?
[1:23:59] <%Ascethetic> MULTI TUBE DRIFTING
[1:24:07] <%Shackle_Rustyford> that lets game it out bit on this was hilarious
[1:24:16] <%BoxNavy> Jebaited
[1:24:19] <%ChestMimik> @BoxNavy Nope. In gampelay terms it's an oversized resource sink
[1:24:20] <%blastyoboots> BACKWARDS XD
[1:24:22] <%MistyMntns> Flipped
[1:24:23] <sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[1:24:25] <+DoctorHam> you need an actual tube behind the entrance
[1:24:28] <$stoptaknall> need a litte tube in front of each one
[1:24:29] <+queaks> you need to make a mini tube segment
[1:24:30] <%blastyoboots> YOU PUT IT BACKWAYS
[1:24:31] <+ReallyBigRocks> I mean you gotta connect em right?
[1:24:31] <DaKnightWarrior> LUL
[1:24:31] <Tisaric> you need them connected right?
[1:24:32] <amiavamp> @Broand I made a new save on Northern Forest and I'm at the point where I'm considering just building on floating platforms
[1:24:34] <+drk_sd> crazy talk
[1:24:37] <%Wurmspawn> They weren't connected with tube
[1:24:40] <+thegreenbenis> You put it backwards.
[1:24:42] <%BoxNavy> @ChestMimik oh ‚òπÔ∏è
[1:24:52] <%blastyoboots> BACKWARDS
[1:24:53] <Dommykins> if you build enough of those in a row you can go fast enough to see god
[1:24:54] <+drk_sd> so much crazy talk
[1:24:59] <+thegreenbenis> BACKWARDS
[1:25:01] <%blastyoboots> YOU BUILT IT BACKWARDS PAT
[1:25:19] <T_Sasquatch> Loooooooooooool
[1:25:23] <%blastyoboots> phew
[1:25:25] <$stoptaknall> @PatStaresAt you also need a little tube for each one too
[1:25:27] <T_Sasquatch> Instantly disproven
[1:25:30] <%Jekado> is pat gonna railgun himself?
[1:25:33] <+ReallyBigRocks> It really looks like it can in fact be backwards
[1:25:37] <sonofthedeepsouth> POOR
[1:25:37] <%Gloom_Tangerine> @patstaresat isn‚Äôt building the space elevator the end goal? Why is it already there?
[1:25:43] <amiavamp> pat is gonna fastball special himself
[1:25:44] <+ReallyBigRocks> given the direction arrows and all
[1:25:48] <%king_wragles> @Jekado God, I hope so
[1:25:52] <xbb1024> are we making motors yet?
[1:25:55] <Doofmaster> you really need a mall
[1:25:58] <%holydeviant1> @Gloom_Tangerine Space elevator is the station for unlocking more tiers
[1:25:59] <%ChestMimik> @Gloom_Tangerine It's a tier 3 goal
[1:26:00] <+rbakervv> @Gloom_Tangerine it's not the end goal, it's just the start of the real game
[1:26:07] <%BoxNavy> can you mark your individual sites?
[1:26:07] <%sweetestbeefs> Rotor 2, the Spin Lords?
[1:26:08] <amiavamp> @Gloom_Tangerine space elevator is an early goal, you send special materials up in it to unlock more tech
[1:26:08] <chancho4tierra> just got here and for a minute this looked like no man sky
[1:26:17] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Send all your products to one warehouse
[1:26:18] <Top_Lane_Duelist> entrances can absoutely be backwards
[1:26:19] <%Wurmspawn> You're placing platform to connect pipes to, but you aren't connecting the pipes at all. You just had 2 seperate entries points looking at a whole super pipe with no connection between them.
[1:26:21] <%blastyoboots> sorry for calling it backwards, I was [OneGuy]
[1:26:22] <KasiCrafter> Weren't the rotors by the iron production machines? Where the pipes were?
[1:26:27] <DaKnightWarrior> Crazy how big this has become.
[1:26:30] <+thegreenbenis> God your dog sounds like a Silent Hill monster when he snores. @PatStaresAt
[1:26:33] <%Gloom_Tangerine> @holydeviant1 thanks!
[1:26:36] <%BoxNavy> STATE TOR AND MOTE TOR
[1:26:39] <T_Sasquatch> I can't believe you placed everything by hand.  It's insane seeing the progression
[1:26:43] <$Dakuu75> "KOTOR"
[1:26:46] <$metzselaar> Did you get the color gun?
[1:26:51] <+OhioNitsud> more kotors would be nice tho
[1:26:58] <Clundy> What about voltrons?
[1:26:59] <%putnampuppeteer> When I explained stator and rotor production to my fiance she made fun of me
[1:27:01] <%blastyoboots> yeeeEEAAAAH
[1:27:01] <%Jekado> I assume if you do it right you can railgun yourself into those safe gel pads for fast cross map travel?
[1:27:03] <%putnampuppeteer> it was great
[1:27:03] <blue8moon> So futuristic
[1:27:12] <amiavamp> Pat gains Dark Side points by polluting the planet
[1:27:17] <%Gloom_Tangerine> @amiavamp thank you! I‚Äôm learning.
[1:27:18] <+ReallyBigRocks> yeah slide jumps
[1:27:18] <$LocDogX86X> what?!?! no MoTorS
[1:27:21] <$stoptaknall> oh by the way if you sink a ticket you unlock a secert
[1:27:24] <%blankwaffle> I love these Futurama tubes
[1:27:25] <%BoxNavy> yay :)
[1:27:32] <+Nemesisnick33> putnampuppeteer you spelled ex-fiance wrong FUNgineer
[1:27:32] <+ReallyBigRocks> just fling yourself across the factory like a madman
[1:27:35] <+thelonechris> Is there a feature that allows for you to melt the planet's ice caps?
[1:27:36] <+ExclusivelyPlastic> Spend those wisely, the cost is VERY exponential
[1:27:41] <%blastyoboots> cost go UP
[1:27:41] <%ChestMimik> @stoptaknall that feels like a bait but I need to know
[1:27:47] <+queaks> yeye get the car!!
[1:27:47] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt conveyor walls, windowed walls, and wall outlets are some of the best things to buy first
[1:27:49] <%sweetestbeefs> holy shit those are just basically futurama tubes
[1:27:52] <%Jekado> i would recommend ladders and different foundation if you haven't from the sink
[1:28:11] <%blastyoboots> double-sided ramps go 8 meters up!
[1:28:11] <%bassoontyphoon> ngl I find Zangief's snores super relaxing for some reason
[1:28:12] <xbb1024> you might be emptying your storage faster then you are filling it
[1:28:13] <rafaelba93> glass shit
[1:28:13] <Doofmaster> feeding it more expensive parts is WAY more efficient though
[1:28:16] <%Jekado> @sweetestbeefs yeah you can easily kill yourself like in futurama
[1:28:17] <sonofthedeepsouth> POG
[1:28:20] <Top_Lane_Duelist> buy zoom zoom cart
[1:28:22] <OwlLightningMage> FUCKING WALLS OH SHIT
[1:28:23] <muniea5> better store than Epic store
[1:28:23] <iosephe> they're glory holes
[1:28:25] <+D00msDayDan> you use them to feed belts through walls instead of having no wall
[1:28:26] <+Nemesisnick33> its a wall with a hole in it
[1:28:27] <rafaelba93> get glass foundations
[1:28:27] <+ReallyBigRocks> Its walls with holes for belts
[1:28:28] <%TheLeadingTone> conveyor walls let you feed belts through walls
[1:28:29] <%Jekado> you can save before you buy pat!
[1:28:29] <+Rofiarf> they are good for  vertical factories
[1:28:30] <%Shackle_Rustyford> they're for putting conveyor belts THROUGH
[1:28:32] <Top_Lane_Duelist> but really wall attachemtns tho
[1:28:33] <OwlLightningMage> Are walls good?
[1:28:37] <%blankwaffle> blankwaffle subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 25 months! did you ever play star wars galaxies?  that dead mmo? what dead games do you miss?
[1:28:40] <%Jekado> the conveyer walls are nice tho
[1:28:40] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> It's a wall that you can connect belts to
[1:28:41] <%legendfather_of_giants> through
[1:28:41] <%ChestMimik> It's a wall with room for a conveyor belt
[1:28:41] <%blastyoboots> they're like the stackable
[1:28:42] <%notsoy> the conveyer wall provides a socket you can hook your conveyer belts into
[1:28:42] <%TheLeadingTone> belts go through
[1:28:43] <%Shackle_Rustyford> through
[1:28:43] <%MistyMntns> It goes straight through
[1:28:44] <%Broand> They're walls with built in conveyor supports, what's to get
[1:28:45] <+D00msDayDan> you feed belts through like conveyor poles
[1:28:45] <%Jekado> through
[1:28:45] <xbb1024> through
[1:28:46] <A0N33> To go through it looks like
[1:28:47] <%BubbaRands> WALLS PogChamp
[1:28:47] <%TheBobulus> wall with holes that conveyor belts to go through
[1:28:47] <Dommykins> It's walls with holes just big enough to fit belts straight through
[1:28:48] <+thegreenbenis> THROUGH
[1:28:49] <%blastyoboots> three straight thru
[1:28:51] <%Jekado> straight threw the wall
[1:28:52] <Doofmaster> it's a wall that's also a conveyor pole
[1:28:53] <%Shackle_Rustyford> come out through and into lifts
[1:28:54] <+robosqueeb> I love that "I dont understand what I'm looking at" is the first thing I hear when joining
[1:28:54] <%Broand> Nah go to attachements for the ones that go on the sides
[1:28:54] <+ccwettr123> its to look shmancy
[1:28:54] <+OhioNitsud> you know who my fave bball player is? John WALL
[1:28:55] <rReizs> they just let you run conveyors through walls so you can connect rooms
[1:28:56] <%Jekado> they have wall hooks to
[1:28:56] <%bassoontyphoon> TRHOUGH
[1:28:57] <CrematedCube> Proper doorways for belts
[1:28:59] <%Jekado> well mount

[1:29:01] <$stoptaknall> @ChestMimik no it's real the game basically gose oh really you think you're smart huh well here a blocky vehicle for your trouble
[1:29:01] <%blastyoboots> go to foundations and get the double-sided ramps! :D
[1:29:03] <iosephe> it allows you to conceal the spaghetti
[1:29:05] <+robosqueeb> How is it going so far, chat?
[1:29:07] <%Wurmspawn> The Mount is for going to the side.
[1:29:11] <%atteroproxy> @OhioNitsud boooooooooooo
[1:29:15] <%Jekado> also the mk.2 power outlet is good if you want a clean power setup
[1:29:15] <amiavamp> the Tony Hawk pack
[1:29:18] <+queaks> get the car üöó
[1:29:20] <+D00msDayDan> double ramp is THE SHIT
[1:29:21] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Makes wiring cleaner, yeah
[1:29:24] <Doofmaster> double ramps are so nice to have, always the first thing I buy
[1:29:24] <%Shackle_Rustyford> tony hawk satisfactory
[1:29:25] <%blastyoboots> DOUBLE RAMP IS LIT, costs half the concrete to go UP
[1:29:27] <%Jekado> double ramp is good for exploration btw

[1:29:41] <%asgard147> limesPoggers
[1:29:41] <%Wurmspawn> Double ramp is best because it cuts down on concret usage for ramps.
[1:29:42] <+queaks> that one
[1:29:43] <%notsoy> the double ramp is super convenient, the other stuff is whatever

[1:29:49] <%blastyoboots> ladder is GOOD
[1:29:50] <%Broand> Oh shit lights
[1:29:50] <%holydeviant1> Cart is portable but useless off of foundations
[1:29:52] <+ExclusivelyPlastic> Ladders and walkways are very useful
[1:29:53] <+Nemesisnick33> no you want cart
[1:29:54] <+robosqueeb> we got flood lights Pogchamp
[1:29:56] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt stackable conveyer poles are basically ladders
[1:29:57] <CrematedCube> The ramps with railings are the best for building

[1:29:58] <+queaks> hey the car for the meme!!
[1:29:59] <%honeyman18> eww

[1:30:01] <$stoptaknall> @PatStaresAt hey pat if you sink a single ticket you unlock a new thing in awsome shop

[1:30:20] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> GOLDEN NUT

[1:30:27] <$LocDogX86X> Oooooooo Statues
[1:30:31] <+Rofiarf> cup plus meme cart
[1:30:32] <Clundy> Build a bowl so you can skate in your mineral harvesting hellsccape
[1:30:34] <%honeyman18> you get a full stack
[1:30:38] <%UltraViolet371> cup is obligatory
[1:30:39] <%BoxNavy> save for funny car :)
[1:30:41] <CrematedCube> Walkways is powerful
[1:30:42] <+MassConnect> you can't nut without a screw
[1:30:42] <+D00msDayDan> ladders and double ramps should be priority
[1:30:42] <%ChestMimik> Railing might be a good idea
[1:30:46] <+triage0> that cart is mad cute tho
[1:30:46] <%holydeviant1> >Railings need to be bought from the company
[1:30:47] <+queaks> cup and cart!
[1:30:49] <rafaelba93> double ramo is GREAT
[1:30:52] <xbb1024> they are decorations
[1:30:53] <Doofmaster> decorative
[1:30:53] <+ExclusivelyPlastic> aesthetics
[1:30:54] <+Rofiarf> looks i guess
[1:30:55] <+ReallyBigRocks> Those are just to look nice @PatStaresAt
[1:30:56] <+queaks> for the pretty
[1:30:56] <%Broand> decorative
[1:30:57] <+camnjb> attachments very useful
[1:30:57] <%holydeviant1> looks
[1:30:59] <%honeyman18> asthetic
[1:31:01] <%MelBrooksKA> Pretty
[1:31:01] <+Saggitori> dog snore so loud lol
[1:31:01] <dbcoopersghost> double ramps are very good
[1:31:02] <+D00msDayDan> you can feed belts through frame foundation
[1:31:03] <%blastyoboots> pillar is good when you have wall outlets
[1:31:07] <Doofmaster> the glass foundations are pretty cute tbh
[1:31:07] <%Broand> and you can run pipes in the grid foundations
[1:31:10] <%MelBrooksKA> Make it not look floaty
[1:31:12] <rReizs> pillars help for stairs so you don't fall down the middle and die
[1:31:14] <%bassoontyphoon> A E S T H E T I C S
[1:31:14] <rafaelba93> double ramp!
[1:31:14] <Top_Lane_Duelist> more than half of the items are super useful
[1:31:17] <%TheBobulus> @patstaresat conveyor stacker has ladder on it for free
[1:31:17] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt wall outlets save a ton of space if you build up
[1:31:22] <$stoptaknall> pat if you sink a ticket you unlock a new thing in shop
[1:31:22] <%couch_potato_Ed_Boy> couch_potato_Ed_Boy subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 15 months, currently on a 12 month streak! I actually kinda liked Fallout 4 but this game is as if someone looked at the Settlement System and said: "I can make a game out of that."
[1:31:23] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt you can make an improv ladder with the stackable conveyor support thing
[1:31:25] <Overloard> for making midgars
[1:31:28] <+Jekado> attachments are good conveyer walls are nice later
[1:31:28] <$HyperionXV> The wood walls are paint-able, the metal ones are not.
[1:31:34] <+CookieCutter007> what is the moaning in the background
[1:31:35] <CrematedCube> I wish they were straightforward upgrades
[1:31:35] <%blastyoboots> wall outlets are tiny power poles
[1:31:40] <%Jekado> wall outlets can be double sided too
[1:31:40] <%Wurmspawn> Infinite connections.
[1:31:41] <Top_Lane_Duelist> glass floor looks nice
[1:31:45] <%ChestMimik> @CookieCutter007 dog
[1:31:46] <xbb1024> technically different walls are also decorations, you could just leave a  space
[1:31:46] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt you put it on a wall, and it has 4 lines of each side
[1:31:47] <CrematedCube> not this weird purchase system
[1:31:47] <Top_Lane_Duelist> over water especially
[1:31:48] <%blastyoboots> wall outlet = mini power pole
[1:31:48] <%maskofmichael> Just build up, stupid
[1:31:49] <%notsoy> you stick wall outlets into the side of the floor or a wall instead of needing a pole
[1:31:50] <+D00msDayDan> the wall outlets are placed on the walls instead of taking up floor space with power poles
[1:31:51] <%honeyman18> double goes through walls on both sides
[1:31:53] <%Broand> Wall outlet is just a power pole
[1:31:54] <%Jekado> so you can have a line going in one end
[1:31:59] <%Jekado> no not infinite
[1:31:59] <%shruke> a lot of these are made for a factory thats enclosed with multiple floors
[1:32:03] <$stoptaknall> k
[1:32:04] <%Wurmspawn> Unless that's been changed, yeah you can neect infinitely.
[1:32:06] <%BoxNavy> p e e
[1:32:09] <%Jekado> same number of connections like their grade
[1:32:10] <%BubbaRands> big pp
[1:32:10] <%putnampuppeteer> piss like a frisbee

[1:32:29] <%putnampuppeteer> god, everything about this game is so good
[1:32:31] <OwlLightningMage> Has Pat made progress at all this stream? I can't tell
[1:32:32] <+ninja_galt> au hau hau
[1:32:39] <%BoxNavy> @putnampuppeteer ??????????
[1:32:41] <%Wurmspawn> @Jekado Must have been changed recently. Last I played I could connect without limitation.
[1:32:51] <%Solarint> Solarint subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months! words words words, blah blah, money isn't real
[1:32:59] <%putnampuppeteer> @putnampuppeteer I said what I said
[1:33:02] <%MelBrooksKA> Just showing off the base right now @OwlLightningMage
[1:33:22] <+ninja_galt> man, I wish I did these kind of numbers. He isn't even live and has 1000
[1:33:28] <+LowBatteryLife> Automation means you're making progress even while just touring the factory! It's great!
[1:33:30] <%putnampuppeteer> it's mostly a reference to a horrible prank you can pull on someone
[1:33:30] <%maskofmichael> The Universe is a hologram, buy Gold
[1:33:34] <+ninja_galt> nobody watches my D&D streams
[1:33:42] <%putnampuppeteer> where you pee in a frisbee, freeze it, then slide it under someone's door
[1:34:06] <%notsoy> CONCRETE STACKS TO 500 WTF
[1:34:22] <%TheBobulus> @patstaresat now would be a good time to go hard drive searching so you can unlock alt recipes before you set up the rest of your factory.
[1:34:23] <BoxNavy> @putnampuppeteer this owns
[1:34:26] <%justcallmebobplease> KEEP GOING
[1:34:28] <abelincoln_catpuncher> lmfao xD

[1:34:29] <%BoxNavy> pat...
[1:34:30] <amiavamp> drunk factorying is best factorying
[1:34:33] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt you should have some water
[1:34:35] <ioriac> pat are you drunk building?
[1:34:35] <%holydeviant1> One of those cases where the drunk didn't hit till you got up?
[1:34:37] <%bassoontyphoon> Sonde the alarm hes back
[1:34:38] <+ThomasOfTroy> @putnampuppeteer This is disturbingly specific and I get the feeling you've done it to someone
[1:34:39] <%sweetestbeefs> DOWN THE SLIPPERY SLOPE
[1:34:39] <%notsoy> some of the alt recipes are RIDICULOUSLY good
[1:34:40] <%DrkJP520> Do you want us to put it in your mouth?
[1:34:43] <%BubbaRands> Drunken stream!
[1:34:46] <%putnampuppeteer> Air bud is in the club gettin' tipsy
[1:34:47] <%MelBrooksKA> Pretty sure concrete stacks to 200 only
[1:34:48] <%texaporte> and it's time to do math
[1:34:49] <abelincoln_catpuncher> come you drunken oaf and ENTERTAIN MR
[1:34:51] <abelincoln_catpuncher> ME
[1:34:51] <+queaks> wanna see the cart
[1:34:54] <rafaelba93> double ramp is great
[1:34:55] <+LowBatteryLife> Drink some red bull
[1:34:55] <%UltraViolet371> how much damage could a drunk engineer possibly do
[1:35:03] <xbb1024> eat some carbs
[1:35:04] <+mrredwednesday> Yung Pat gettin lean
[1:35:13] <%notsoy> nah, i'm in the update right now and concrete was stacking to 500
[1:35:21] <$stoptaknall> @PatStaresAt hey pat did you unlock a the secert vehicel?
[1:35:21] <+ReallyBigRocks> Walkways as well are nice
[1:35:22] <+ninja_galt> dog snoring noises
[1:35:26] <putnampuppeteer> @putnampuppeteer It's like nuclear bombs. The true purpose of the knowledge is not to use it.
[1:35:27] <%Wurmspawn> I'm sorry, that seems to have been patched, wall outlets no longer have infinite connections.
[1:35:30] <Doofmaster> most stackable things already have ladders on the side
[1:35:35] <%Mendin> Zangief sounds like a baby wookie
[1:35:44] <%walternatorz> your vacuum is malfunctioning
[1:35:47] <%Broand> Either outlets or conveyor mounts
[1:36:00] <+HostileNitrile> the catwalks in organization are good
[1:36:03] <Top_Lane_Duelist> what does the coffee cup do
[1:36:06] <+ninja_galt> yer dug sounds like a creaky boat m8
[1:36:09] <+BusterRepukken> zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
[1:36:16] <+ExclusivelyPlastic> Save for walkways
[1:36:18] <jerobees> You drink coffee out of it
[1:36:19] <%BoxNavy> Kreygasm
[1:36:20] <Doofmaster> save for factory cart or the new lighting?
[1:36:21] <cochramd1992> seems like a melee weapon
[1:36:22] <+ReallyBigRocks> @Top_Lane_Duelist You can drink it
[1:36:23] <%MelBrooksKA> @Doofmaster The base doesn't, he needs to use the tower to get up and down his building
[1:36:23] <+gamemassacre1> you might have more tickets at the sink now
[1:36:29] <%Jekado> double ramps are very good for exploration
[1:36:30] <+LowBatteryLife> Coffee cup for maximum efficiency
[1:36:31] <amiavamp> drink coffee through your helmet
[1:36:32] <%Emperor_Machinus> @Top_Lane_Duelist You use it to drink coffee
[1:36:32] <xbb1024> warning: once you buy walls you will care more about your building appearance
[1:36:35] <%blastyoboots> double ramp pack = half price GO UP with foundations
[1:36:39] <OwlLightningMage> See a doctor if you have golden nuts
[1:36:41] <%MelBrooksKA> I recommend ramps
[1:36:47] <%bassoontyphoon> Maybe just save up for later
[1:36:50] <%Jekado> conveyer walls are okay but i don't think you can stack them
[1:36:56] <$stoptaknall> @PatStaresAt if you sink a ticket it will unlock a new vehicle you can get at the shop
[1:37:02] <+ninja_galt> When do you buy the grinders to make soylent green?
[1:37:09] <%bevyrage> you can sort of stack them since it's pretty close to one another
[1:37:12] <+froggycleric> If you see a doctor for your golden nuts, they're just going to steal your balls
[1:37:14] <%Jekado> i feel conveyer walls are not helpful as say the conveyer rack
[1:37:16] <greendino12345> I personally love the hypertube wall attachments, makes less clutter for the tubes
[1:37:18] <%BoxNavy> drink that purple shit
[1:37:24] <putnampuppeteer> @amiavamp Some gas masks come with a hose-straw attachment that lets you drink through the mask. Could be like that.
[1:37:27] <%ChestMimik> How are you drinking that through the mask?
[1:37:28] <+queaks> I thought you had a helmet on
[1:37:30] <Manwad> purple drank
[1:37:30] <%Mendin> Yep
[1:37:30] <%sweetestbeefs> delicious delicous beans
[1:37:30] <+ninja_galt> purple drank, sunny d
[1:37:32] <%bevyrage> yeah conveyor rack is much more efficient
[1:37:37] <%Dunmarkh> purple drank
[1:37:39] <+ccwettr123> remember ui is still hugemungous
[1:37:42] <%W1nterTitan> Damn fine cup of purple

[1:37:55] <%bassoontyphoon> Some nice steaming grape soda
[1:37:57] <%BoxNavy> the cups just for rp drinking? thats kinda neat
[1:37:59] <OwlLightningMage> Infinite coffee is dangerous
[1:38:05] <%BoxNavy> rp items are cool
[1:38:06] <Clundy> Good ol kerfee
[1:38:09] <KasiCrafter> Salt Iron war inbound POG
[1:38:16] <%UltraViolet371> prune juice? a warrior's drink
[1:38:19] <%ChestMimik> @OwlLightningMage What are you, my doctor?
[1:38:26] <%MelBrooksKA> I think the coffee has a use
[1:38:28] <%Jekado> the coffee cup also makes it easier to see and take photos
[1:38:31] <%honeyman18> Pat rapping again
[1:38:35] <%putnampuppeteer> and next you build a delte
[1:38:37] <xbb1024> Pat Motors!
[1:38:39] <%putnampuppeteer> *delter
[1:38:43] <%Emperor_Machinus> You smeltor, you deltor
[1:38:52] <abelincoln_catpuncher> Infinite coffee just means you're always like Fry when he drank 100 cups of coffee
[1:38:53] <$stoptaknall> @PatStaresAt a new feature they have you can copy buildings with the recipe
[1:38:56] <+ReallyBigRocks> @Jekado there's just a photo mode tho
[1:38:59] <%holydeviant1> I like the coffee cup, really brings home the workaday aesthetic
[1:39:01] <%goose_attack_almanac> Doesn't your character wear a helmet in Satisfactory and thus is unable to rink the coffee?
[1:39:02] <%BoxNavy> @Emperor_Machinus oh get outta here
[1:39:03] <%jarednotwithsubway> the grid? seems the same
[1:39:19] <%holydeviant1> and here we drunky go

[1:39:37] <%jarednotwithsubway> @stoptaknall how do you use that feature?
[1:39:38] <%holydeviant1> Last two were off~
[1:39:38] <abelincoln_catpuncher> ahhh, what a good start to my shift *throws coffee onto your helmets visor*
[1:39:39] <%AyotoCorp> Are those backwards
[1:39:47] <KasiCrafter> Last two misaligned... NotLikeThis
[1:39:54] <%Emperor_Machinus> @BoxNavy Witness me!

[1:39:57] <%Jekado> i wish you could hold a button to chain build power

[1:40:12] <softbirby> nvm stream glitched
[1:40:12] <$stoptaknall> @jarednotwithsubway I belive once you set it in the building you can just crtl+v
[1:40:17] <+HostileNitrile> instead of opening the build menu everytime you can just middle click a building to copy it
[1:40:23] <xbb1024> you can put the poles on top of the splitters
[1:40:24] <%holydeviant1> To think that this process is EVEN FASTER in factorio

[1:41:14] <%Jekado> i'm not sure if this is the best way to stack the smelters because  the first one gets most of the minerals i like to split them evenly so they are all getting the ore at the same rate instead of in succession
[1:41:14] <%BoxNavy> at least you can mass delete

[1:45:44] <+ShadowFoxoon> The melters smelt 30 a min, slowest belt moves 60 a min
[1:45:45] <rafaelba93> no blueprints like in factorio
[1:45:46] <%Jekado> coffee is important
[1:45:48] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Start from the far end and walk backwards placing belts?
[1:45:48] <%ChestMimik> @DrkJP520 Sure lets go with that

[1:46:15] <SirDogBear> a better way would have been game to have sim city overhead view mode option and then switch to first person whenever LUL
[1:46:17] <%holydeviant1> Look at this man never spill a damn drop
[1:46:21] <%DrBunni> 240 iron ingots a second?
[1:46:21] <%putnampuppeteer> Fuck, this game is dangerous
[1:46:21] <%Jekado> @rafaelba93 nope this game is in early access unlike factorio tho there are mods that do add it.
[1:46:32] <%Mendin> "It's too late" -sip-
[1:46:38] <+ReallyBigRocks> Coffee cup might be one of my favorite items in any game ever
[1:46:41] <%putnampuppeteer> whoops
[1:46:48] <HerbCHoover> hey pat long time fan first time watching
[1:46:50] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> I also would like an overhead mode. Might make watchtowers useful.
[1:46:51] <Tuna_Can_0> @rafaelba93 FeelsBadMan I refuse to build a mega base without my const. bots
[1:46:53] <$Dakuu75> It's always something, isn't it.
[1:47:03] <+ReallyBigRocks> It makes for some great physical comedy
[1:47:08] <%MelBrooksKA> Do the drones they added in this update work like the Factorio drones?
[1:47:22] <SirDogBear> Inanimate Carbon Rod PogChamp
[1:47:23] <%MelBrooksKA> I loved those things, sucks they were so late game
[1:47:26] <muniea5> man fuck screws
[1:47:31] <%ChestMimik> 90
[1:47:32] <notsoy> use the To-Do feature
[1:47:34] <+JonWhoLovesFlatWomen> factorio drones are amazing
[1:47:40] <$stoptaknall> @PatStaresAt dose the copy setting paste the setting when you make new buildings?
[1:47:41] <+ReallyBigRocks> 180 screw
[1:47:46] <%Jekado> what level is drones at in this game?
[1:47:52] <Tuna_Can_0> FeelsGoodMan logistics networkl
[1:47:54] <%Jekado> i haven't loaded up the experimental yet
[1:47:56] <%holydeviant1> Screws get their own damn base that is always on full tilt so they have a consistent output
[1:48:02] <%blastyoboots> but it's making 5 reinforced plates a minute not 1 a minute
[1:48:04] <+ShadowFoxoon> I hate how horribly things split in this game.  Not 3rds or halves.  It's like 5ths
[1:48:05] <xbb1024> this is where you start plotting stuff out
[1:48:06] <%ChestMimik> @Jekado I think Tier 7?
[1:48:08] <%putnampuppeteer> Imagine if the final update to the game just gives you an in-game copy of Microsoft Excel
[1:48:15] <KasiCrafter> I mean. It's easier to remember "I need twice as many screws as plates".
[1:48:18] <%AncelDeLambert> Once in orbit over planet Druidia, we'll suck up all their air, destroying Druidia, and saving Spaceball!
[1:48:21] <muniea5> time for belt spaget
[1:48:23] <%MelBrooksKA> Oh, is the new update on experimental?
[1:48:23] <%AncelDeLambert> Everybody get that? Good!
[1:48:25] <%ChestMimik> @putnampuppeteer OKAY YOU JOKE BUT
[1:48:31] <%Jekado> okay i should be able to get into drones that would be helpful
[1:48:39] <SirDogBear> This will all be worth it when this computer Pat's making starts playing Crysis with no issues :O

[1:50:34] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt experimental also now lets you use math expressions instead of having to type out decimals, like 1/3
[1:50:37] <%walternatorz> come back to me when it has a spreadsheet editor
[1:50:37] <%bevyrage> google does that too

[1:51:21] <$Dakuu75> never oppening the calculator on my pc ever again
[1:51:29] <%Jekado> yeah iron to screws is one of the better recipies early
[1:51:34] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> You can underclock machines to save power and be efficient.
[1:51:37] <+ReallyBigRocks> @ShadowFoxoon Thats a really clutch early alt recipe
[1:51:41] <%Mothman007> I woulda hoped it was Wilkins Instant Coffee, the tv puppet threatened m

[1:53:03] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> 8 smelters, 17 constructors, 8 assemblers for 10 frames a minute
[1:53:06] <%ChestMimik> @MelBrooksKA I for reall will load Python up when I need a calculator sometimes
[1:53:06] <$stoptaknall> @PatStaresAt see if the copy settings makes the new buildings have the recipe
[1:53:10] <%BoxNavy> no
[1:53:21] <+ReallyBigRocks> I always stagger my constructors
[1:53:35] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> Pat how does it feel having discovered your tech brain and sequentially being able to scratch at it
[1:53:37] <+ReallyBigRocks> You can put them inline with smelters that way
[1:53:47] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> subsequently*

[1:55:47] <Tuna_Can_0> 5
[1:55:47] <librettodude> The number become the MANY number
[1:55:54] <%maskofmichael> 6? not 5?
[1:55:56] <%MelBrooksKA> psaBig psaHoldon
[1:56:07] <jerobees> The largest number possible
[1:56:07] <%putnampuppeteer> This is pornographic
[1:56:09] <+RyanTheRecluse> 6?
[1:56:16] <seth45er> PAINT, you could paint them
[1:56:16] <SirDogBear> This thing gonna make so many Bort license plates PogChamp
[1:56:19] <%EternalJedi> 9?
[1:56:43] <$stoptaknall> @PatStaresAt if you do the multi delete it tell you how many building it is
[1:56:46] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> built the conveyer belts into the first one then copypaste the set down the row
[1:56:56] <chhdez> CUBE
[1:56:57] <marklarphd> Don't fuck the boot
[1:57:03] <%putnampuppeteer> Watching someone who cares about organization do this is honestly satisfying
[1:57:03] <SirDogBear> A boot
[1:57:04] <%maskofmichael> @seth45er Paint them red so they go faster
[1:57:05] <CrimsonFox777> Fucking a boot! scottfLewd
[1:57:07] <%Wurmspawn> @seth45er Pat probably hasn't bothered with that research tree.
[1:57:16] <+ShadowFoxoon> The more I watch Pat, the more I realise how much of my base I have to tear up and redo.  I never thought I'd be learning from Pat
[1:57:16] <chhdez> Dakka
[1:57:18] <$Afterman_> does coffee do anything
[1:57:21] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> I don't know if that actually works, never played oh no
[1:57:38] <chhdez> Coffee let's you do stupid things faster
[1:57:39] <+Nemesisnick33> Afterman_ it gives me the shits
[1:57:56] <+ReallyBigRocks> @Afterman_ you can drink it
[1:57:57] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> alright fair enough
[1:58:02] <%walternatorz> OSHA
[1:58:04] <+BettyMwwaahh> AHH!
[1:58:10] <+Saggitori> theres a mod to do the full copy paste
[1:58:12] <%walternatorz> Need guard rails
[1:58:17] <xbb1024> just be careful if you are building on a cliff
[1:58:17] <PRchris13> Ooh <3
[1:58:27] <+ThomasOfTroy> Jumping was cooler though
[1:58:29] <%EternalJedi> #OSHA
[1:58:36] <$stoptaknall> @PatStaresAt if you do the multi delete it shows you how many building there are so you don't need to count
[1:58:38] <%Emperor_Machinus> dealting
[1:58:41] <%king_wragles> What about delting?
[1:58:51] <xbb1024> try putting the poles on top of the splitters
[1:58:54] <%BeeComfy> Hey pat Listing to the podcast, CS student here. Love hearing the conversation on Block Chaining and screaming my head a at work "Oh god please don't take a shot at explaining this, I will lose it"
[1:58:56] <CappuccinoGuil> wait, aren't those belts in reverse?
[1:58:59] <chhdez> Pump those deltoids
[1:59:04] <@Velyndra> GROSS
[1:59:07] <@Velyndra> INEFFICIENT
[1:59:12] <%walternatorz> psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin
[1:59:15] <+Nemesisnick33> is it uniform though pat?
[1:59:15] <@Velyndra> YOU CAN USE HALF AS MANY
[1:59:25] <%blaggablag> That's actually a pretty neat way to set that up I didn't think of that
[1:59:36] <%blaggablag> I'm stealing this shit for my game
[1:59:37] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> I like putting power poles on the splitters and mergers
[1:59:40] <%putnampuppeteer> A potentially apocryphal story claims that Franz Kafka invented the hard hat. This isn't related to anything but I feel like it's vaguely apropos
[1:59:43] <+ReallyBigRocks> @CappuccinoGuil If you connect an input and output it sets the direction automatically
[1:59:49] <SirDogBear> all of this to reheat coffee  CorgiDerp
[2:00:10] <muniea5> you'll all fucking see
[2:00:19] <CappuccinoGuil> @ReallyBigRocks yeah, but it looked weird, like it was going in reverse. Might be just a bug or I saw it wrong
[2:00:28] <Tuna_Can_0> uh huh CoolStoryBob
[2:00:41] <%ChestMimik> @CappuccinoGuil There've beena  few visual bugs today
[2:00:48] <+ReallyBigRocks> @CappuccinoGuil We'll see I guess lmao
[2:00:58] <chhdez> It's free real estate
[2:01:02] <+Nemesisnick33> pat you cant you build the conveyor belt first then put the mergers on it?
[2:01:08] <xbb1024> If you want to save splitters, you could use both left and right outputs
[2:01:24] <+TensecondTarvis> If you hold control, new builds should snap to input/output lines,
[2:01:27] <%putnampuppeteer> OVEN
[2:01:29] <DrFacilier> So is there a point to this game besides building a big crazy factory? Like is there some market system to sell what your factory produces?
[2:01:32] <%putnampuppeteer> hell yeah oven
[2:01:34] <%SaiyanShoto> never sure Kappa
[2:01:53] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Do you still have questions about modding Satisfactory?
[2:01:58] <%ChestMimik> @DrFacilier There's a "resource sink" to earn coupons, but it all feeds back into automating and building
[2:02:01] <SirDogBear> This will be the sickest Tony Hawk stage ever PogChamp
[2:02:02] <+ReallyBigRocks> @DrFacilier Nope, just gotta make parts to unlock new parts to make
[2:02:07] <%putnampuppeteer> @DrFacilier You advance up the tech tree for now.
[2:02:10] <invalid_robin> Seems like you need some tea or coffee
[2:02:15] <pepinillomaton> holly shit, what a monstrosity
[2:02:22] <Overloard> so this is how the random plates end up in the rods
[2:02:32] <%putnampuppeteer> God, this is beautiful
[2:02:39] <+TopTieramisu> your pipes are creaking
[2:02:41] <+TensecondTarvis> @PatStaresAt If you hold control, new builds should snap to input/output lines,
[2:02:42] <$stoptaknall> @DrFacilier at the moment there is the exploring the map is huge but the story won't come in till 1.0
[2:02:57] <SirDogBear> It comes with its own monorail? PogChamp
[2:03:02] <$stoptaknall> @PatStaresAt if you do the multi delete it shows you how many building there are so you don't need to count
[2:03:03] <%putnampuppeteer> I do wish you had an option for 90 degree-angle auto-aim on your conveyor belt tho
[2:03:15] <+zsDirtyHarry> I thought Zangief snoring was ambient noise from the game at first lol
[2:03:19] <chhdez> What's that spooky sound
[2:03:31] <zhenthrim213> god i cant wait for the spahgetti monster pats gonna create in Factorio
[2:03:31] <+ReallyBigRocks> I wish you could ride the conveyors through the splitters and mergers
[2:03:35] <chhdez> Dat Silent Hilley sound
[2:03:39] <%blaggablag> Giefznore sounds like a lowkey moan
[2:03:44] <$Wurmspawn> @chhdez The pupper snoring.
[2:04:03] <+D00msDayDan> Zangief‚Äôs snoring sounds like some ambient noise from dark souls
[2:04:12] <@commanderclaw> No wonder Pat likes the Mechanicus, he basically already is one
[2:04:13] <Cymen90> Is that seriously the dog snoring? OhMyDog
[2:04:19] <+queaks> there's a mod for auto belting splitters near outputs
[2:04:21] <the_super_suit> just got here, did Pat manage to enslave the local wildlife yet?
[2:04:22] <SirDogBear> BegWan
[2:04:22] <+rbakervv> @Cymen90 yep
[2:04:31] <%blaggablag> BOLD OF YOU TO ASSUME SO
[2:04:43] <DrFacilier> Interesting, definitely wanna try this game next time a sale comes through
[2:04:44] <%blaggablag> the answer is it was always out of power
[2:04:47] <%MechArch> just got out of work to watch pat do a work similar to mine NotLikeThis
[2:04:56] <Tuna_Can_0> probably on fire atpCap
[2:04:58] <%Mendin> I dont think t hey want a rod too fast, pat
[2:05:00] <$stoptaknall> hey pat is the miner hooked up?
[2:05:14] <SirDogBear> everyone loves inanimate carbon rod
[2:05:25] <%putnampuppeteer> For a brief period of time I fucked up my pipeline network so every time my network went down I'd have to spend several minutes fixing the coal plant infrastructure. That was a bad time
[2:05:27] <Cymen90> Brain go Kreygasm
[2:05:30] <Rionxgarland> so the new update that changes mechanics is live?
[2:05:32] <%Paperware> Turning on minors....ew....
[2:05:38] <+ReallyBigRocks> @PatStaresAt Pat press X
[2:05:41] <%ChestMimik> I do that all the time
[2:05:41] <+rbakervv> @Rionxgarland yep
[2:05:43] <%Jekado> how much iron ore is pat making from the miner at this point?
[2:05:55] <+RyanTheRecluse> why not use to do list or codex?
[2:05:56] <%ChestMimik> Like yeah there's an encyclopedia but it's less button presses away
[2:05:59] <Rionxgarland> sweet i was waiting to start till the update hit
[2:06:00] <%texaporte> that happens all the time
[2:06:02] <$RealThiele> proper quebec construction
[2:06:02] <Rionxgarland> thanks
[2:06:06] <the_super_suit> did Pat enchant his armor yet
[2:06:09] <$stoptaknall> press x pat
[2:06:15] <%Wurmspawn> Wait... is pat forgetting to input his minor into smelter's first?
[2:06:15] <SirDogBear> enough iron for one golf club! CorgiDerp
[2:06:21] <+queaks> pat you can ctrl c and ctrl v recipes
[2:06:28] <+ReallyBigRocks> It gives you all the recipes and the rates
[2:06:29] <$stoptaknall> tell you what you wanted from the buildings
[2:06:36] <%MelBrooksKA> @RealThiele I hope not
[2:06:38] <+gogorobotz> How do you keep your coffee hot?
[2:06:39] <chhdez> One super powers, please
[2:06:41] <%walternatorz> such a gentleman
[2:06:52] <Rionxgarland> so its safe to say pats addicted
[2:07:07] <%Wurmspawn> Wiat I see the smelters n/m.
[2:07:09] <$stoptaknall> @PatStaresAt press x tell you what you wanted from the buildings
[2:07:14] <librettodude> we passed "safe" assumptions miles ago
[2:07:30] <%putnampuppeteer> @Rionxgarland this game is catnip for goblins
[2:07:35] <+queaks> 3 assemblers
[2:07:47] <+Saggitori> anyone know if this game is turing complete?
[2:07:52] <Rionxgarland> heh
[2:07:54] <%Undenizen> Pat, you're doing an amazing job keeping that coffee steady.
[2:08:01] <+Nemesisnick33> sure
[2:08:30] <%SuckerPunchSyd> @saggitori oh god oh fuck it probably is
[2:08:33] <+MisterAvry> damn I need a cup of coffee
[2:08:37] <%putnampuppeteer> sipp
[2:08:48] <%blaggablag> IF you wanna eaily pick up you should make a container buffer
[2:08:57] <the_super_suit> Pat would you prestige if it gave you +50% efficiency
[2:08:57] <SirDogBear> inefficiency acceptable in a factory...? :O
[2:09:08] <CrematedCube> A little on the excessive side helps with spare building materials later
[2:09:12] <$stoptaknall> @PatStaresAt in the codex(x) it will give you the recipe and the rates without having to look at a building
[2:09:12] <%putnampuppeteer> snoor
[2:09:17] <vile_brand> make 2
[2:09:17] <%blaggablag> Yaaaaaaaaaaay
[2:09:26] <+Pixel_Matt> PogChamp
[2:09:31] <sonofthedeepsouth> sip
[2:09:32] <%Undenizen> @SirDogBear more like redundancy than inefficiency
[2:09:33] <xbb1024> use the top entrance
[2:09:55] <SirDogBear> Pat is building additional silos to hold the ore PogChamp
[2:10:05] <%ChestMimik> Anyone know if it's worth it to make a warehouse in this game?
[2:10:08] <%putnampuppeteer> I feel like you could track Gief's sleep stages by the timbre of his snores
[2:10:10] <sonofthedeepsouth> sip the coffee
[2:10:16] <%MelBrooksKA> @Saggitori First search on google shows a reddit post of a person proving it's Turing complete, so yes
[2:10:34] <SirDogBear> @Undenizen ah i see that makes more sense now LUL
[2:10:40] <%EternalJedi> ChestMimik entirely up to you how you wanna organize it
[2:10:44] <+Saggitori> hella
[2:10:51] <+sulf> your gonna blink pat and 6 hours will pass
[2:11:06] <%EternalJedi> ChestMimik you can have a separate building for storage containers orweave the containers in the everything else
[2:11:07] <%SuckerPunchSyd> I love and hate Turing machines so much
[2:11:09] <%TheWinged7> !uptime
[2:11:10] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 11m.
[2:11:23] <HeWhoMonologues> I was told just now that I must love Elmo.
[2:11:30] <+TensecondTarvis> @PatStaresAt If you hold control, new builds should snap to the blue input/output  lines you see on the foundations when in build mode
[2:11:38] <%EternalJedi> psaElmo
[2:11:39] <+queaks> screws
[2:11:45] <%Undenizen> @SirDogBear redundancy is not always bad. means you have backups and safeguards!
[2:11:46] <swift_malachi> Is the stream repeating itself periodically for anyone else?
[2:11:50] <+Pixel_Matt> Dog Snore
[2:11:58] <%EternalJedi> swift_malachi nope
[2:12:07] <%putnampuppeteer> it's just melt
[2:12:10] <+ThomasOfTroy> @swift_malachi Not for me
[2:12:13] <yourliteraldog> coffee
[2:12:16] <+sulf> what is that fucking snore sound holy moly
[2:12:20] <%GarbageNirvana> the player buffer is weird sometimes
[2:12:21] <swift_malachi> Probably my crap internet then
[2:12:22] <%Dunmarkh> @swift_malachi yes
[2:12:24] <+sulf> is that actually zangief
[2:12:29] <%Xelhesia> giefy snore
[2:12:29] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> or build up?
[2:12:32] <%putnampuppeteer> I was born ready
[2:12:34] <the_super_suit> yes
[2:12:35] <%holydeviant1> @sulf psaDogchamp
[2:12:42] <%EternalJedi> sulf it is indeed
[2:12:44] <%GarbageNirvana> Gief is psaBig snore
[2:12:44] <+sulf> jesus zangief could wake the dead
[2:12:46] <%Dunmarkh> @swift_malachi you are not one guy, we are two guy
[2:12:47] <%king_wragles> @sulf No, Paige is sawing wood just off screen
[2:12:48] <SirDogBear> @Undenizen oh for sure, i agree, its just at first the way it was worded, it sounded like Pat was happy there was inefficiencies LUL
[2:12:58] <%rumtumtugnutz> @sulf Gief is a wheezy snorty boy
[2:13:01] <%Paperware> Man I thought the snoring was the game, not Gief
[2:13:15] <%putnampuppeteer> sounds like he just woke up
[2:13:23] <$stoptaknall> @PatStaresAt make a new floor?
[2:13:24] <%mister___doctor> Why's Pat running around with a cup of coffee
[2:13:29] <+sulf> the buildings in this game feel too big, i wish we could just have a flat plane map to build on
[2:13:32] <%GarbageNirvana> probably due to food
[2:13:37] <SirDogBear> you want quality screws they need to be that long
[2:13:47] <%EternalJedi> sulf you can!
[2:13:49] <%ChestMimik> Honestly I'd love a way to zoom out even just to place buildings, everything is so big
[2:13:51] <the_super_suit> why no walls Pat? what if done alien comes and steals stuff of the conveyer belt??
[2:14:02] <%EternalJedi> sulf just make a shitton of foundations and make yourself a flat area
[2:14:32] <SirDogBear> pat needs more space for his factory, guess its time to conquer more land PogChamp
[2:14:56] <$stoptaknall> either that or more floors
[2:14:59] <%moonmintparadise> Hey Pat how are your brain chemicals doing ?
[2:14:59] <HeWhoMonologues> Cheer1500 I do not typically sub on twitch due to time constraints, but I have enjoyed your content both solo and non solo for years now so cheers you mad lad.
[2:15:11] <socratetris> How does the coffee always stay hot?!?!
[2:15:20] <Brogus_Almighty> bro Ive never made a factory that looked nearly this nice
[2:15:23] <+D00msDayDan> @socratetris space coffee
[2:15:25] <%ChestMimik> Ramp
[2:15:26] <%putnampuppeteer> oh NOOOO
[2:15:27] <$stoptaknall> pat make a new floor
[2:15:29] <+sulf> @Brogus_Almighty magic
[2:15:43] <sonofthedeepsouth> is it?
[2:15:47] <RogueMinja> Time to build up.
[2:15:51] <socratetris> @D00msDayDan Space is... hot?
[2:16:01] <+sulf> i looked at the schedule and saw factorio on friday, will this be his first time playing it ?
[2:16:03] <%moonmintparadise> Acceptance is the first step into yadda yadda yadda
[2:16:06] <+JFKRobot> Pat, do you like coffee?
[2:16:11] <$stoptaknall> nice
[2:16:19] <HeWhoMonologues> Such lies
[2:16:19] <%ChestMimik> Pat's Kekkei Genkai
[2:16:22] <the_super_suit> can't wait for you to turn it on and it all breaks instantly
[2:16:24] <HeWhoMonologues> You secret genius.
[2:16:29] <%jarednotwithsubway> *golf clap*  :)
[2:16:33] <MyFavoritePants> accidental success is the best success
[2:16:33] <Midnight188> offtopic but is Apex down rn? had trouble getting the game to load earlier.
[2:16:37] <+ReallyBigRocks> @socratetris Coffee can't cool off if there's no medium for it to radiate heat into, that's big brain
[2:16:41] <%mister___doctor> I wish I had some coffee now
[2:16:44] <Rionxgarland> all of this is just to make one cup of pure Colombian coffee
[2:16:55] <+queaks> pat you obviously prerecorded this and just reversed the footage
[2:17:06] <HeWhoMonologues> How lovely
[2:17:07] <CrematedCube> Remind me, what is our end product here?
[2:17:08] <marklarphd> This minecraft texture pack is impressive
[2:17:13] <socratetris> @ReallyBigRocks *brains implodes, and then explodes*
[2:17:16] <+sulf> this is step 1 :)
[2:17:19] <sonofthedeepsouth> POG 6 POG
[2:17:19] <Ner234> 6 PogChamp
[2:17:20] <iosephe> whoa
[2:17:21] <%Mrbaconator> YEAAAAAAA
[2:17:21] <+ReallyBigRocks> Modular frame production is a nightmare
[2:17:22] <%ChestMimik> @CrematedCube Glorified cubes
[2:17:22] <%crimsonharvest> one every ten seconds
[2:17:22] <cochramd1992> BASED
[2:17:28] <%mister___doctor> Where's the Game Zone going
[2:17:29] <%holydeviant1> It's pretty fast!
[2:17:29] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt just wait til you get the alternate screw recipe that skips rods
[2:17:31] <+Pixel_Matt> Oh yeah it's all coming togeather
[2:17:33] <%Mrbaconator> is that SPACE COFFEE
[2:17:36] <%PinkSuprende> pat you need alternate recipes, like screws from ingots instead of rodssssss
[2:17:37] <SirDogBear> pat gonna get a congratulations by his bosses then be told factory makers will now be automated by AI Coffee Cups PrideRise
[2:17:39] <$stoptaknall> @PatStaresAt ouch this is why you need alts
[2:17:46] <+ReallyBigRocks> I remember seeing a reddit post of some dude who made a MASSIVE factory to make like 50/min lol
[2:17:50] <Cymen90> God, the Minecraft kids in here are getting annoying. We get it, you like Redstone.
[2:17:51] <HeWhoMonologues> Making me wanna give this a try. After I finally beat monster hunter Iceborne.
[2:17:53] <%Xelhesia> you make gundams out of those modular frames
[2:17:53] <%blastyoboots> hold left ctrl to snap to guidelines
[2:17:55] <+HostileNitrile> I'm using the collective resources of at least 30 iron nodes to make 12 heavy modular frames a minute
[2:18:05] <%TheWinged7> @PatStaresAt i dont think you need a merger on the first one
[2:18:06] <the_super_suit> well I can make 7 modular frames in 56 seconds
[2:18:06] <$KnivesEve> its so weird pat is finally playing minecraft LUL
[2:18:30] <%putnampuppeteer> I just got to the point where I need to make heavy modular frames and I don't want to deal with that shit
[2:18:37] <sonofthedeepsouth> 200 iqs
[2:18:40] <CappuccinoGuil> For some reason, I am DYING to play some FF14 after watching this
[2:18:40] <+sulf> pat start thinking about do you want your factory to go vertical or wide
[2:18:43] <%mister___doctor> Where's the story mode
[2:18:56] <SirDogBear> This is the prologue to Pat's legendary career as a Steve Main in Smash PogChamp
[2:18:56] <%TheWinged7> psaHoldon
[2:18:58] <+queaks> I legit don't see why people think this is at all like minecraft
[2:19:03] <%legendfather_of_giants> @putnampuppeteer heavy frames and elevator parts if where i give up and use the reddit guy
[2:19:06] <%ChestMimik> @mister___doctor probably not until release
[2:19:06] <%putnampuppeteer> Telltale Presents: Satisfactory
[2:19:12] <Cymen90> @queaks It is not.
[2:19:12] <CappuccinoGuil> @mister___doctor it's still Early Access
[2:19:12] <$stoptaknall> @PatStaresAt this is why you need alts you could be making 4 to 5 times that with a lot less space
[2:19:14] <%ChestMimik> @queaks Tekkit
[2:19:16] <+ReallyBigRocks> @mister___doctor Hangin out in a future update somewhere
[2:19:17] <librettodude> @queaks s'a build'em'up
[2:19:25] <%ThirdWelles> lol story mode
[2:19:27] <+sulf> @queaks there was a very popular factory mod for minecraft that became the inspiration for factorio
[2:19:31] <%MelBrooksKA> @queaks Its based off a mc mod
[2:19:33] <%putnampuppeteer> @queaks Feed the Beast was really similar.
[2:19:38] <+sulf> @queaks which is the inspiration for this
[2:19:52] <%mister___doctor> I was joking and I got three real answers
[2:19:55] <Ner234> Math is hard
[2:20:00] <%ChestMimik> Your numbers didn't line up smoothly to begin with
[2:20:05] <+ccwettr123> @PatStaresAt it helps me to start from the end and work back
[2:20:07] <Cymen90> @sulf But neither Factorio, nor this or Minecraft were the first of the genre lol
[2:20:10] <xbb1024> This is why you learn math, kids. Even if you play games for a job, it's still relevant
[2:20:15] <TOONFOOD> use slugs to fix bad math LUL
[2:20:18] <jellssssss20> *Here's where the big brain comes in* he says
[2:20:18] <$stoptaknall> welp overclocking time
[2:20:20] <%maskofmichael> Tear it ALL down, restart the game, every thing is ruined
[2:20:21] <%crimsonharvest> @PatStaresAt this is why the calculators exist, once you've set it up yourself a couple times you get tired of fucking up the ratios in your head
[2:20:24] <SirDogBear> He gets paid to drink coffee not do math!!!!
[2:20:24] <%UltraViolet371> assembler is fed
[2:20:25] <+queaks> so mobas are like age of empires??
[2:20:29] <%MechArch> blame it on the intern
[2:20:38] <Lancaster_H> @Cymen90 it doesnt matter, they were the ones that popularized it
[2:20:40] <CappuccinoGuil> chat, is playing final fantasy 14 drunk a bad idea?
[2:20:41] <sonofthedeepsouth> welp
[2:20:42] <+sulf> @Cymen90 definitely, factorio just did it well enough to be seen as the standard now
[2:20:45] <ammobasket> Need to use paper brain
[2:20:46] <%mister___doctor> Ok for real what is up with the coffee
[2:20:47] <librettodude> Yes, actually. Genres are all evolutions on each other in games
[2:20:49] <%EternalJedi> limesD TOP ASSEMBLER IS FED AS FUCK
[2:20:58] <CrematedCube> I'm trying to think of older games in this vein, the Tycoon games come to mind
[2:21:10] <+ReallyBigRocks> @mister___doctor it's just coffee
[2:21:11] <%maskofmichael> @CappuccinoGuil Well, I think doing anything drunk is a bad idea
[2:21:19] <%Ascethetic> @cappuccinoguil only if you're healing
[2:21:31] <$stoptaknall> you have enough slugs to over clock?
[2:21:33] <xbb1024> it'll still work, just not with efficiency
[2:21:39] <socratetris> But Pat, at least is still LOOKS pretty
[2:21:41] <CappuccinoGuil> @Ascethetic I'm a tank playing solo grinds
[2:21:47] <SirDogBear> intern should have made the cup of coffee better BibleThump
[2:21:49] <NitronStreams> you screwed up the screws?
[2:21:51] <CappuccinoGuil> @maskofmichael not with that attitude
[2:21:54] <%cylish> cylish subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 33 months! Hey hey 33 months, woo!  If you havnt started up Nioh 2 yet I super suggest a netflix show called Age of Samurai, it will lessen the number of times a character shows up without explanation and you're forced to be  like "Who are you though?"
[2:21:54] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt try satisfactory-calculator com it does the math for you if you put in the part and how many /minute
[2:22:06] <%ThirdWelles> "Based on a mod that put Not-Minecraft into minecraft. So when you take the Minecraft out it's still like minecraft"
[2:22:14] <sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[2:22:19] <%Ascethetic> @cappuccinoguil if you're PLD, you'll be fine
[2:22:20] <+sulf> why would i look up ratios when i eyeball it and go good enough
[2:22:29] <%ThirdWelles> People who compare this to minecraft are fools
[2:22:36] <CappuccinoGuil> @Ascethetic MRD here, level 33
[2:22:39] <talokur29> That‚Äôs some good looking coffee fam. Can I have some? GivePLZ
[2:22:40] <%king_wragles> Because these are The Rules
[2:22:43] <+queaks> @thirdwelles that's exactly my point
[2:22:46] <SirDogBear> It's okay Pat, in the near future super advanced factories gonna be replaced by Magic anyway CorgiDerp
[2:22:47] <Cymen90> Holy crap this chat is full of people who think this genre began a couple months back when Factorio came out and the only inspiration available was Minecraft mods
[2:22:48] <%crimsonharvest> modular frame 6/min?
[2:23:08] <CrematedCube> This is the part where I stubbornly refuse calculators
[2:23:09] <librettodude> It's sort of like how Arkham did the assassin's creed combat, but then that became "Arkham-y" because that was popular and put in everything
[2:23:11] <%ThirdWelles> @queaks I'm agreeing with you, my guy
[2:23:22] <%mister___doctor> Your mother was a modular frame
[2:23:25] <%crimsonharvest> i mean its basically the same genre as Transport Tycoon
[2:23:32] <%ChestMimik> Burn it all down
[2:23:36] <%Jaxnos> i remember playing this mod in minecraft *nods in making fun of people*
[2:23:36] <HeWhoMonologues> Fuck you and fuck that game!
[2:23:38] <CrematedCube> I find my fun in scrawling it out myself
[2:23:41] <%Ascethetic> @cappuccinoguil you got your  WAR job stone?
[2:23:43] <%Wurmspawn> Burn it all down!
[2:23:43] <+queaks> if a new mona comes out I don't say it's a warcraft 3 clone
[2:23:43] <%maskofmichael> Become the One Guy Pat
[2:23:48] <%atteroproxy> @Ascethetic The only way to play 14 drunk with no issues is to play DPS. Trust me.
[2:23:53] <$stoptaknall> @PatStaresAt you could over clock
[2:23:55] <pokefan9956> is this minecraft Kappa
[2:24:00] <SirDogBear> blow up the factory Mau5
[2:24:01] <%blastyoboots> @Cymen90 Factorio's been around with a good playerbase a looooooong time
[2:24:04] <CappuccinoGuil> @Ascethetic considering I have no idea what that means, I'd say no
[2:24:08] <librettodude> no, it's yourcraft
[2:24:12] <%blaggablag> @crimsonharvest I wish TT was as transparent. That game could charitably be described as capricious at the best of times
[2:24:16] <+sulf> do you have the materials to overclock
[2:24:19] <%ChestMimik> @pokefan9956 No this is Patrick
[2:24:23] <CrematedCube> Big brain idea: small underclock
[2:24:35] <%atteroproxy> @CappuccinoGuil Did you do you're job quests?
[2:24:39] <CappuccinoGuil> @atteroproxy but what if I'm just running around doing quests and events solo as a MRD?
[2:24:40] <%Ascethetic> @cappuccinoguil do your class quests
[2:24:41] <talokur29> Now I want to make some hot chocolate from looking at that cup of Joe. PogChamp
[2:24:44] <%atteroproxy> your
[2:24:46] <CappuccinoGuil> @atteroproxy yeah, all of them
[2:24:47] <dracovastor> dont waste overclocking on SCREWS lol
[2:24:51] <ToneBacas> does coffee boost production?
[2:24:57] <CrematedCube> I support this settlement
[2:24:58] <%BoxNavy> everyone in chat do your class quests right now
[2:25:03] <SirDogBear> The mad man! Underclocking instead of overclocking?!!!!
[2:25:04] <%ChestMimik> You already knew that
[2:25:11] <talokur29> Anyone feel like going for a cup of Joe?
[2:25:15] <%atteroproxy> @CappuccinoGuil As long as you're not doing duties. You should be fine.
[2:25:16] <%crimsonharvest> @crimsonharvest At least the modern versions of Open TTD have dispelled any mystery by now
[2:25:20] <Cymen90> @librettodude Except Arkham Asylum came out the same year as AC2 which still had very different combat. It was Brotherhood was introduced free chaining of kills that released after Arkham.
[2:25:24] <%Wurmspawn> Nto the most efficient?! Why bother, then??
[2:25:27] <jerobees> @ToneBacas it boosts your body's production of pee :c
[2:25:31] <+sulf> little tight on space
[2:25:37] <%putnampuppeteer> Is there an actual purpose to underlocking? Like, does it save on power?
[2:25:39] <CappuccinoGuil> @atteroproxy nah, I haven't even touched duty stuff.
[2:25:44] <$stoptaknall> @PatStaresAt you also may want to get some alts at some point you can triple the output with half the space with the right ones
[2:25:47] <%BoxNavy> chat how do you play summoner and dragoon i dont get it
[2:25:50] <%atteroproxy> @CappuccinoGuil Look in your inventory in the bottom right and see if you have any stones
[2:25:52] <invalid_robin> This is why there is a z axis
[2:25:54] <xbb1024> yeah, underclocking saves power
[2:26:10] <%putnampuppeteer> danke
[2:26:14] <%Ascethetic> THE GRID
[2:26:17] <%ChestMimik> @putnampuppeteer Saves power and easier to control ratios
[2:26:24] <+sulf> i really should of built up in my original save
[2:26:30] <Cymen90> @blastyoboots My point is that Factorio is not the genesis of the genre either.
[2:26:42] <%Mendin> Summoner is easy: You just drop two DoTs on enemy and alternate between instacast summon abilities, the blight trigger, and ruin 2/4
[2:26:46] <%atteroproxy> @BoxNavy My first class is a dragoon lol. Just don't stand in circles while you're doing your shit and keep eye of the dragon going.
[2:26:47] <%Mendin> You never stop moving
[2:26:50] <%Ascethetic> Yo Pat, could you ever live "off the grid"?
[2:26:53] <librettodude> @Cymen90 Exactly; Arkham beat them to the punch by a bit before Brotherhood's free-chaining. I also think that "Assassin's Creed Combat" rolls off the tongue less easily than "Batman Combat"
[2:26:54] <cochramd1992> Pat Stares At ASMR
[2:27:01] <%GarbageNirvana> The Grid was Midway's last arcade game
[2:27:16] <%Wurmspawn> "Screw line" So is THAT what your call you d-(dragged off stage)
[2:27:31] <%UltraViolet371> the grid is a digital frontier discovered by jeff bridges
[2:27:37] <+DrSmashy> The Grid: a digital frontier
[2:27:38] <+TipsyND> Should you though?
[2:27:39] <+DrSmashy> fuck
[2:27:45] <librettodude> brevity when describing a game concept beats almost everything
[2:27:48] <SirDogBear> These modular frames gonna get Pat all the ladies PogChamp
[2:28:05] <%Ascethetic> @boxnavy im still learning SMN myself lol
[2:28:42] <%Jaxnos> toight
[2:28:43] <%BoxNavy> Kreygasm
[2:28:44] <%putnampuppeteer> bigbrain
[2:28:46] <%atteroproxy> @BoxNavy If you want an easy ass class. Just play Red Mage. It has easy-to-follow buttons and lets you be a messiah to the party with an insta-raise.
[2:28:50] <%maskofmichael> That's what she said!
[2:28:51] <xbb1024> remember workplace safety
[2:28:56] <Cymen90> @Cymen90 Which is why it frustrates me when Woolie claims AC was first. I loved the Ezio trilogy but Woolie should work on getting more than 10 punches in a row.
[2:28:58] <%GarbageNirvana> SMN rotation at 80 is something else
[2:28:59] <invalid_robin> Can you put one mat on top and one mat below?
[2:29:06] <SirDogBear> Those power cables look like a lawsuit waiting to happen LUL
[2:29:09] <Huzzysnuzzy> Screw line isn't square, Pat (to help with the OCD!)
[2:29:19] <%Broand> Man I dunno if I should start afresh or not on the new update
[2:29:35] <$stoptaknall> 3 splitters on top of each other should do it for the lefts
[2:29:37] <+ReallyBigRocks> Splitters won't snap to assembler inputs
[2:29:38] <xbb1024> climb on top of the assembler to see better
[2:29:43] <%BoxNavy> @atteroproxy oh dude i recently decided to main red mage and beat 5.0 with it recently lol. i just like tryin out the other classes and having some understanding with em
[2:29:52] <%Jaxnos> what a beautiful assembly line
[2:29:53] <%Mr_Pylon> climb up?
[2:29:58] <%crimsonharvest> climb up on a machine and look down
[2:30:08] <%garagon31> psaWrong
[2:30:23] <%putnampuppeteer> Just a guy hopping around a planet, drinking his coffee and having a mental breakdown
[2:30:28] <+queaks> build the belt first? then add the splitters
[2:30:29] <%holydeviant1> looks all misaligned to me
[2:30:38] <%Jaxnos> these look offcenter and it's hurting me
[2:30:42] <%Jaxnos> yeah
[2:30:44] <%BoxNavy> beltstacking monkaS
[2:30:46] <%ChestMimik> Yup works exactly like that
[2:30:46] <%crimsonharvest> yeah they stack with the belt stackers
[2:30:50] <+D00msDayDan> belts can clip into each other without messing anything up
[2:30:53] <SirDogBear> misaligned BibleThump
[2:30:54] <$RealThiele> we final fantasy now?
[2:30:55] <%lilytastic> do outpost towers give you a good perspective to build with or is it just too fiddly to be done from afar?
[2:30:58] <CatsDrunkonCopper> you need more space
[2:30:59] <+queaks> might be too close
[2:31:00] <%Jaxnos> das why textures connect so nicely
[2:31:15] <+ReallyBigRocks> They're at the same height as the stackable conveyor poles too
[2:31:17] <rafaelba93> with stacable conveyor poles
[2:31:20] <%MechArch> toit like a toiger
[2:31:21] <+D00msDayDan> if you stack 3 mergers/splittes it'll reach the top and bottom slot on the industrial container
[2:31:22] <%ChestMimik> @lilytastic It CAN witha good angle but yeah the whole thing is kinda fiddly
[2:31:29] <%Jaxnos> i bet you like screwing the top wait
[2:31:30] <+queaks> move the assemblers further away
[2:31:32] <$Dakuu75> you were about to say "cute"
[2:31:33] <%atteroproxy> @atteroproxy Me too, that's why I have 4 jobs. DRG, RDM, DRK, and WHM. I mainly did it for the role quests but it's fun playing different roles.
[2:31:34] <%holydeviant1> knew it
[2:31:35] <%maskofmichael> You think its cute
[2:31:38] <Cymen90> DELETE THE SAVE FILE IT IS OVER
[2:31:40] <xbb1024> I am
[2:31:51] <%ChestMimik> burn it all down
[2:31:52] <+queaks> easier to move the assemblers away
[2:31:56] <+D00msDayDan> oh no
[2:32:03] <%GarbageNirvana> U 'avin a giggle m8
[2:32:04] <+ReallyBigRocks> @D00msDayDan and that's the same height as the shortest conveyor elevator too
[2:32:10] <+kingdomluciano> What am I staring at? Is this Amazon
[2:32:14] <xbb1024> to do this, you need to use the elevators and stack the belts
[2:32:15] <%maskofmichael> Pat your too home to play games, go drunk
[2:32:40] <%PanicSwytch> Infinite Factory Works
[2:32:40] <SirDogBear> this new factory update for Fortnite still seems sick though PogChamp
[2:32:46] <%Mendin> Isnt this all tier 1.5 iron crafting and somehow its
[2:32:52] <%BoxNavy> @atteroproxy i have not had the guts to get into tanking and i used to heal for a bit in heavensward. its all super stressful i just wanna sit in the back and hit buttons lol
[2:33:04] <$stoptaknall> @PatStaresAt do 3 it should give you the space
[2:33:05] <Midnight188> how much money does this game cost?
[2:33:09] <%ChestMimik> Burn it all down
[2:33:10] <%BoxNavy> EleGiggle
[2:33:12] <xbb1024> put the assemblers further out
[2:33:12] <%blastyoboots> when using stacked splitters I think you have to put the belts from top to bottom
[2:33:15] <+queaks> move the assemblers!!!
[2:33:16] <CappuccinoGuil> @CappuccinoGuil @atteroproxy in my inventory in the bottom right? I only seethe number of items I have, though?
[2:33:17] <%Mendin> Are you deliberately building mk1 belts pat?
[2:33:22] <%blastyoboots> or the bottom belt says clearance against the top belt
[2:33:25] <+b1unkey> !uptime
[2:33:26] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 33m.

[2:33:27] <%MechArch> psaFist
[2:33:30] <$Dakuu75> @PatStaresAt so dumb question: what's the end game? like, is there something special you need to build or some quota you need to fill?
[2:33:33] <SirDogBear> you lease the game and pay for it by how many modular frames you produce CorgiDerp
[2:33:40] <Yakobro> no
[2:33:42] <%BoxNavy> @CappuccinoGuil i think they meant armory chest
[2:33:44] <%SveriSageAdvice> ye no prob

[2:34:16] <+MisterAvry> you stay here and dance, monkey!
[2:34:20] <$jarednotwithsubway> keep the splitters, put conveyors up from the assemblers and link belts from those to the splitters
[2:34:22] <%BoxNavy> nuh uh
[2:34:22] <CappuccinoGuil> @BoxNavy Soul Crystals? I've got none
[2:34:23] <$stoptaknall> 3 spliters can proably give you the space

[2:34:40] <xbb1024> use the elevators
[2:34:42] <%atteroproxy> @atteroproxy Tanking and Healing is easy until you get to current 70+ content. Until then, you're overpowered. Queue times are mindblowing if you're used to being DPS.
[2:34:42] <+queaks> just remove the tube then rebuild it
[2:34:43] <%moonmintparadise> eat your food, pat
[2:34:46] <+RealMichaelPhelps> build up

[2:34:55] <$Dakuu75> Brain go BRRRRR
[2:35:03] <ammobasket> What if you put it over there
[2:35:08] <%BoxNavy> @BoxNavy weird. did you do the msq quest sylph management? i think you need to do that and your lv 30 job quest
[2:35:12] <%atteroproxy> @BoxNavy Yeah that's what I ment. Armory chest.
[2:35:14] <+Saggitori> Eat dinner
[2:35:23] <+queaks> @maskofmichael how about you leave and do something else?
[2:35:32] <CappuccinoGuil> @atteroproxy I checked the Souls Stones, got none of those
[2:35:32] <%Mendin> Eh, Doma Castle tends to be a gear check if you're still just on the Shire gear
[2:35:38] <%BubbaRands> Pat, your brain needs food go eat
[2:35:41] <$Dakuu75> LOL Gief

[2:36:24] <%TheotherKristian> Do some yoga, motherfuckers!
[2:36:37] <CappuccinoGuil> @atteroproxy hmmm maybe I haven't finished it? Do job quests end around level 30?
[2:36:38] <%PanicSwytch> Ok guys 10 min break
[2:37:03] <%EternalJedi> limesMusic
[2:37:14] <%holydeviant1> Recently, through a chain of bad deals and misunderstandings, I've been handed WoW for free with a month of play time and holy cow the poor thing is a MESS
[2:37:34] <%atteroproxy> @CappuccinoGuil You normally get a crystal after doing the job quests up to 30. Did you complete everything under the main scenario part of the hud?
[2:37:40] <%putnampuppeteer> the more I see this intro this animation, the more I love it
[2:37:50] <%putnampuppeteer> *this intro animation
[2:37:57] <%holydeviant1> Imagine if all the story content of FF was available right away and none of the timeline made any sense
[2:38:13] <%holydeviant1> and you have WoW's current state of affairs
[2:38:20] <%BoxNavy> @CappuccinoGuil where are you in the msq?
[2:38:20] <%atteroproxy> @CappuccinoGuil They keep going until 70. But you geta crystal to improve your job at 30.
[2:38:30] <$Dakuu75> Reload~
[2:38:34] <CappuccinoGuil> @atteroproxy I believe I did, but I can't tell you exactly what those are. Can you elaborate more?
[2:38:41] <%holydeviant1> There are quests in the MAIN CITY of factions that take place FOUR OR MORE EXPANSIONS AGO
[2:38:50] <$RealThiele> wow has thrown away all their world building for anime plots. but not like good anime plots
[2:39:11] <CappuccinoGuil> @BoxNavy okay, what is msq?
[2:39:28] <%atteroproxy> @atteroproxy I started playing right before ShB came out and the servers were PACKED. So queue times were horrible
[2:39:33] <%BoxNavy> @BoxNavy main story quests.
[2:39:36] <%holydeviant1> @RealThiele I wouldn't mind that! It's the fact that the timeline position is decided by what zone you're in that bugs me
[2:39:50] <%holydeviant1> If you quest in the wrong area, DEAD PEOPLE JUST COME BACK AND SAY HI
[2:39:51] <%PanicSwytch> Random question, I just started FF Crystal Chronicles Remastered...I know the online is fucky but wtf happened? Is the online dead? I don't see anyone hosting?
[2:39:53] <%atteroproxy> @CappuccinoGuil Hold on I'm looking for stuff
[2:40:08] <%putnampuppeteer> WoW devs'll wind up doing a bunch of PCP and copypasting story notes from Eiken
[2:40:22] <%putnampuppeteer> fuck it, animay tiddy undead
[2:40:36] <CappuccinoGuil> @BoxNavy Lvl 15: It's Probably Pirates. So not that far in, maybe?
[2:40:55] <%EternalJedi> very early
[2:41:05] <%BoxNavy> @CappuccinoGuil well there ya have it. you can get your job crystal after doing the msq quest Sylph Management
[2:41:09] <Darkfire346> dj sleepy fat boi
[2:41:10] <%holydeviant1> @putnampuppeteer If anyone touches the Alexstrasza human design I will hunt them down
[2:41:43] <%BoxNavy> sylph management is a level 20 quest btw
[2:41:49] <CappuccinoGuil> @BoxNavy cool, not sure what it does, but nice to look forward to it. I've been mainly just futzing about the world and doing random quests while exploring.

[2:42:53] <%BoxNavy> job crystals give you access to new skills so its super important to equip once you get one
[2:42:54] <%holydeviant1> Oh, and the other thing I hate about WoW currently? Everything scales to you to a certain point in a zone, then stops. Which is fine, if the quest lines for zones didn't outlevel you into new zones BEFORE THEY COMPLETED
[2:42:57] <%atteroproxy> @CappuccinoGuil Oh ok, yeah you have to progress the main story further.
[2:43:34] <%Monkeyweed21> @CappuccinoGuil you just wanna focus on the main story and do whatever else strikes your fancy, as long as you read the tutorials the game gives you'll be fine
[2:43:48] <ptmpopulatethemoon> psaDogchamp
[2:44:01] <Darkfire346> this is a long brb, whatd i miss
[2:44:05] <CappuccinoGuil> @BoxNavy gotcha. I might do some story quests eventually then. I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed with trying to optimize all the XP gathering for classes because that's how my brain works
[2:44:13] <ptmpopulatethemoon> pat went to eat
[2:44:21] <%holydeviant1> @Darkfire346 Pat's a little drunk and trying to sober up
[2:44:24] <%atteroproxy> @CappuccinoGuil If you're enjoying things now, then that's great. You be able to open up your job once you get farther in the story.
[2:44:38] <Darkfire346> i just assumed he fell inthe toilet again
[2:44:38] <%putnampuppeteer> spagooter go in orb
[2:44:41] <%Monkeyweed21> @holydeviant1 Watching Jesse Cox stream FF14 and constantly shit talking WoW by comparing the two gives me life
[2:44:42] <%Mendin> Pat rarely drinks, especially on stream
[2:44:54] <%BoxNavy> honestly i spent a year bullshitting around in ff14 and stopped playing for a while. then i got spoiled on a really cool boss and now im hard back in
[2:45:04] <CappuccinoGuil> @atteroproxy Dope. Not sure if I wanna go about each class one by one or try to level them all up simultaneously though
[2:45:06] <ptmpopulatethemoon> Pats getting drunk right now on industrial power
[2:45:12] <%EternalJedi> CappuccinoGuil I tend to do every sidequest I can find and was consistently overleveled for story/starter job quest stuff LuL it's not too bad
[2:45:16] <ptmpopulatethemoon> assembly line whimsy
[2:45:23] <holydeviant1> @Monkeyweed21 Oh you have no idea. WoW just started implementing bosses with DON'T STAND HERE, JACKASS! indicators like FF has
[2:45:31] <%EternalJedi> I got to 30 THaumaturge and am now chilling with gathering/crafting
[2:45:33] <CappuccinoGuil> @EternalJedi my kinda playstyle LUL
[2:45:35] <%BoxNavy> yeah dont sweat exp right now
[2:45:45] <%BoxNavy> but later monkaS
[2:45:46] <%ChestMimik> I gurantee Pat's looking at his mashed potatoes and going "where did I go wrong with the numbers?"
[2:46:03] <%VoidBaronJules> what'd we Miss?
[2:46:10] <%Monkeyweed21> @CappuccinoGuil You get a massive exp bonus to every class that isn't your highest-level, so keep that in mind
[2:46:20] <%BoxNavy> 40
[2:46:22] <%holydeviant1> But on the other hand, I have massive tanxiety in FF, and all my quest lines feel like they lead to "HARD MODE BOSS TIME COMPLEX BOSS HARD MODE HAR HARD BOSS"
[2:46:22] <CappuccinoGuil> @EternalJedi dude, that the dream, I love crafting in MMOs
[2:46:22] <HeWhoMonologues> Like 45 mins
[2:46:22] <%putnampuppeteer> prolly?
[2:46:22] <%AzureGale> 20 years
[2:46:25] <%EternalJedi> CappuccinoGuil and I can't speak for the other two towns cuz I haven't cleared them out yet, but Ul'Da has some pretty good sidequests, dialoguewise
[2:46:31] <%maskofmichael> 69 years
[2:46:32] <ptmpopulatethemoon> NotLikeThis < pat looking at the monster of a factory hes made
[2:46:34] <%Mendin> It's been 8-DAMMIT
[2:46:36] <Darkfire346> We thought you fell in the toilet again!
[2:46:37] <%EternalJedi> CappuccinoGuil I'
[2:46:38] <%putnampuppeteer> It's been, one week since you looked at
[2:46:39] <%putnampuppeteer> etc
[2:46:43] <CappuccinoGuil> @Monkeyweed21 oh shit, really? So like, if I max out Marauder, the other classes get XP boost?
[2:46:51] <%EternalJedi> CappuccinoGuil I'm really enjoying the gathering crafting stuff so far rooAww
[2:46:55] <+atteroproxy> @atteroproxy You'll be playing the game forever if you try to level each class right now. If you stick with a main class and learn the game with it, you can come back later and have leveling boosts related to how high your main class is.
[2:46:55] <%putnampuppeteer> and the gief groan is back
[2:46:57] <%putnampuppeteer> hell yeah
[2:46:58] <%walternatorz> pat, you've left the vacuum on again
[2:47:09] <ptmpopulatethemoon> cocked your head to the side and said im angry  @putnampuppeteer
[2:47:18] <%holydeviant1> Like, I read about the Moogle King and I'm just like NotLikeThis
[2:47:20] <%Jekado> yeah its super helpful
[2:47:30] <CappuccinoGuil> @EternalJedi I'll be real, I've been skimming over sidequest dialogue and just focusing on main quest story. It's just too much text for me to read and play in my day to day.
[2:47:32] <%Jekado> for some reason they rotate when i stack them?
[2:47:36] <+ReallyBigRocks> Yeah it's super convenient
[2:47:46] <Darkfire346> I wish Zangief could communicate with his farts.
[2:48:04] <$stoptaknall> @PatStaresAt you can also put spliters right next to each other and build one one up to get it clean
[2:48:06] <%putnampuppeteer> one brap for yes, two for no
[2:48:08] <jerobees> That's what barking is
[2:48:13] <%BoxNavy> @Darkfire346 jermaDisgust
[2:48:15] <xbb1024> not really, but ok
[2:48:25] <%EternalJedi> CappuccinoGuil entirely fair
[2:48:31] <+ReallyBigRocks> @Jekado I think they rotate so that the input for the next one is over an output for ease of elevator-ing. I think crates do the same thing
[2:48:36] <Darkfire346> and the hungrier he is, the louder the fart
[2:48:40] <MayorRev> just got here what's par doing
[2:48:47] <%EternalJedi> CappuccinoGuil to be fair, I skim too, I'm just a fast reader LuL
[2:49:27] <%ChestMimik> @MayorRev makin cubes
[2:49:29] <Darkfire346> IT BEGINS
[2:49:30] <MayorRev> is he making concrete
[2:49:32] <%putnampuppeteer> PUBBY
[2:49:33] <%BoxNavy> oh chat about the new game + thing. is it possible to do a new game + from shadowbringers without having to go through everything else? i really wanna replay it :(
[2:49:35] <MayorRev> ooooh
[2:49:37] <+ReallyBigRocks> OOHH he WOOFIN
[2:49:41] <CappuccinoGuil> @EternalJedi fair enough, I try to at least capture the idea of the characters and story of the sidequests, but it's all so much "go here, get/kill thing" and there areso many.
[2:49:54] <%putnampuppeteer> tell your dog I love him
[2:50:00] <MayorRev> oh you have a mug?
[2:50:01] <%ThirdWelles> I don't get how you can play at this FOV. It feels so claustrophobic
[2:50:17] <%blastyoboots> lol
[2:50:21] <%BoxNavy> wow :)
[2:50:21] <$stoptaknall> hey pat how many of the biomes have you seen or have you been just been in the starting location?
[2:50:25] <%blastyoboots> easy enough
[2:50:32] <MayorRev> can you drink out of the mug
[2:50:33] <%BoxNavy> well max it out
[2:50:39] <%LeiaSkynoober> @BoxNavy New Game + FF14 is more of a "rewatch cutscenes" type deal. I think you can buy your way through though?
[2:50:41] <+ReallyBigRocks> @ThirdWelles he's also on a TV
[2:50:43] <%blastyoboots> omg i need to do that to fast-build
[2:50:45] <%ThirdWelles> Really!? It feels so much lower
[2:50:47] <Yakobro> I only play with 720 fov
[2:50:50] <$SGrim> 60 FoV master-race KKona
[2:50:51] <%ChestMimik> Activate your byakugan
[2:50:53] <%blastyoboots> the hoverpack is gonna make that super easy to do
[2:50:58] <%AzureGale> youre not hardcore unless you got that 270 fov
[2:50:58] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Did anyone tell Pat about that mod that lets him build multiples at once?
[2:51:02] <Laioken13> bruh you aint playing on 360 fov?
[2:51:09] <+Hilleltaco> If your FOV isn't horribly warping your screen, is it truly high enough?
[2:51:23] <%BoxNavy> @BoxNavy aw wack.
[2:51:32] <+vdalson> @BoxNavy you can totally replay the shadowbringers quests in new game+
[2:51:37] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt still liking the game?
[2:51:45] <Darkfire346> what if babies shot out of women like a fully automatic shotgun
[2:51:47] <+ReallyBigRocks> backwards
[2:51:52] <+ReallyBigRocks> whoops
[2:51:55] <%AzureGale> If your monitor is not completely surrounding you are you truly playing Satisfactory?
[2:51:57] <+vdalson> you just wont get exp or quest rewards from it
[2:51:58] <%BoxNavy> @BoxNavy :O
[2:52:28] <s1rcuit> @Darkfire346 the first thing I thought after reading your comment was "weapon jam"
[2:52:30] <%putnampuppeteer> oh _no_
[2:52:47] <jerobees> @PatStaresAt is there no way to rotate objects that have already been placed?
[2:52:48] <%ThirdWelles> @BoxNavy You can choose NG+ from "Chapters" of the MSQ
[2:52:59] <Darkfire346> @s1rcuit Quick, reload to clear the jam!
[2:53:05] <%ChestMimik> @jerobees Not so far no
[2:53:08] <$stoptaknall> @PatStaresAt hey how much of the map have you explored did you see the monster hunter biome?
[2:53:25] <MayorRev> what does this machine do again? make cubes?
[2:53:25] <%BoxNavy> @ThirdWelles thank you. doin this once im done with the patch content :)
[2:53:28] <jerobees> That's the worst, @ChestMimik
[2:53:31] <MayorRev> what kind of cubes
[2:53:32] <%holydeviant1> Whose hoping for a power outage?
[2:53:51] <%ChestMimik> @MayorRev The modular kind
[2:54:06] <%Ascethetic> @holydeviant1 can that happen?
[2:54:11] <cochramd1992> THROW THE SWITCH!
[2:54:12] <Darkfire346> or itll blow up
[2:54:12] <MayorRev> modular cube vapour9LucyPog
[2:54:15] <iosephe> programmers curse
[2:54:18] <%ChestMimik> If I had a nickel for every time I said that
[2:54:22] <%Tearonex> "SHOULD"
[2:54:26] <+Hilleltaco> @jerobees Destroying something gives you 100% of the materials back and building is fast, so it's not so bad
[2:54:27] <%MechArch> psaCrazyhead
[2:54:27] <%BoxNavy> power outage monkaS
[2:54:28] <%Undenizen> this is what programmers say a lot. they're usually wrong
[2:54:34] <%AzureGale> Watch it blow up
[2:54:42] <%UltraViolet371> ooh, aesthetic
[2:54:42] <%Tearonex> Crazy Talk on stand by
[2:54:43] <Darkfire346> Sheeee talks crazy talk
[2:54:51] <%LanceCorpralScottBukake> It won‚Äôt work
[2:54:54] <%ChestMimik> This will either work or turn into a hitman stream
[2:55:05] <+ReallyBigRocks> YEAH DO IT
[2:55:10] <jerobees> :o
[2:55:10] <$stoptaknall> um pat don't you don't you need reinforced plates?
[2:55:11] <%holydeviant1> Now to turn on Hall of the Mountain King
[2:55:16] <+ReallyBigRocks> NYOOOM
[2:55:19] <%BoxNavy> :O
[2:55:19] <%LanceCorpralScottBukake> Its gunna explode
[2:55:21] <cochramd1992> YYYYEEEESSSSSSSS
[2:55:31] <%UltraViolet371> *chugs coffee anxiously*
[2:55:31] <%BoxNavy> uh oh

[2:55:35] <%ChestMimik> BIRD
[2:55:38] <$stoptaknall> @PatStaresAt um pat don't you don't you need reinforced plates?
[2:55:43] <HeWhoMonologues> @holydeviant1 A good plan indeed.
[2:55:47] <s1rcuit> @holydeviant1 aren't there two different versions of that song?
[2:56:01] <+ReallyBigRocks> Man the bloom is ridiculous in this update
[2:56:08] <%Xelhesia> uh oh
[2:56:10] <+Brightstreak> OMG look at this anti-spaghetti. I love it
[2:56:13] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[2:56:13] <$stoptaknall> you set to the cubes
[2:56:14] <%Tearonex> psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead
[2:56:17] <LVL1_Scumbag> "Should" work
[2:56:25] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> need to keep a notepad on this shit so you don't misstep lol
[2:56:28] <%AzureGale> F
[2:56:32] <%BoxNavy> START OVER
[2:56:34] <pi_in_the_sci> I thought those three assembler were for reinforced plates, which you would combine with rods to make modular frames in aother assempbler line
[2:56:48] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> and checklist ffs
[2:56:49] <LVL1_Scumbag> Tear it all down
[2:56:49] <+ReallyBigRocks> Don't you have a factory for reinforced plates already?
[2:56:53] <+Brightstreak> Pat are you open to using an ease of life foundation mod? Just helps lay foundation faster. Still costs the same
[2:56:57] <%ChestMimik> psaHoldon
[2:56:59] <%BoxNavy> üî• ITS FINE üî•
[2:57:00] <WyvernsArentDragons> Narrator: It was not fine.
[2:57:02] <%UltraViolet371> monkaS
[2:57:09] <%Tearonex> psaCrazyhand_HF psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead
[2:57:10] <%maskedsongbird> I bought and started playing this game last week because of Pat's VOD where he first started it. Before I knew it, it was 8 hours later. This game is nuts.
[2:57:18] <%AzureGale> "It's fine" are some famous last words right there
[2:57:18] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Mods don't work in experimental, right?
[2:57:32] <%ChestMimik> G R O W
[2:57:33] <%Tearonex> psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead psaCrazyhand_HF
[2:57:37] <%holydeviant1> psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead
[2:57:38] <%Tearonex> there fixed it
[2:57:40] <xbb1024> second level
[2:57:40] <+ReallyBigRocks> NEXT FLOOR
[2:57:44] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> build up!
[2:57:44] <copyritetm> It's actually really interesting to watch you play a game like this lmao
[2:57:44] <%AzureGale> Welp
[2:57:45] <+D00msDayDan> U P
[2:57:45] <+Brightstreak> @maskedsongbird When i first bought the game, I went nucking futs. I'd be like huh? it's 4AM?
[2:57:47] <%Mr_Pylon> time to dig up!
[2:57:48] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> YEAH
[2:57:50] <$stoptaknall> yea second floor
[2:57:52] <+Hilleltaco> e x p a n d  t h e  c u b e
[2:57:52] <+ReallyBigRocks> Good thing you got ladders and stuff
[2:57:52] <pi_in_the_sci> up is better
[2:57:53] <%Arweynn> THE FACTORY MUST GROW
[2:57:53] <%Undenizen> want go uppy
[2:57:55] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Verticality is heroic
[2:57:55] <%UltraViolet371> TO THE MOON
[2:57:57] <%Mendin> DIG UP
[2:57:57] <%ShutUpAceyP> are we making a toilet?
[2:58:00] <%Mendin> Use those new walls, baby
[2:58:05] <%EternalJedi> limesYay WE ASCEND!
[2:58:07] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> awww
[2:58:09] <%Mr_Pylon> awww, out? but up
[2:58:19] <%blistexthief> So do you think this spaceman is making minimum wage?
[2:58:23] <s1rcuit> for some reason after he said go up the song "Next Stop: Everything" started playing in my head
[2:58:28] <%ChestMimik> Build a tower of cubes to mock god
[2:58:29] <TOONFOOD> how much power is left?
[2:58:31] <$stoptaknall> @PatStaresAt up better reamber you need to use those frames for new items
[2:58:32] <cochramd1992> hall of the mountain king was a good choioce
[2:58:44] <Psyramics> spaceman is getting paid in company scrip which is barely enough to keep his ass alive
[2:58:46] <+Brightstreak> use vertical conveyor lifts to look nicer
[2:58:49] <%AzureGale> Rods sounds like birds and bees talk
[2:59:01] <s1rcuit> @blistexthief wouldn't surprise me since the remote does most of the work
[2:59:09] <%brickwall35> is Pat winning?
[2:59:11] <Top_Lane_Duelist> i thought i t was a spacewoman
[2:59:21] <%holydeviant1> Someone please edit this with cuts to Hall of the Muntain King
[2:59:21] <%maskedsongbird> @maskedsongbird Yeah, I started at I think four or five in the afternoon. I looked over at the microwave clock after what felt like just a few hours later and saw it was almost midnight, lol.
[2:59:33] <%holydeviant1> Even just turning it on on yutube is great
[2:59:44] <%putnampuppeteer> quonq riet
[2:59:47] <+Brightstreak> @maskedsongbird game is super addictive
[2:59:54] <+PenmanLupine> Build a second floor of Assemblers
[3:00:00] <%maskedsongbird> You can never have enough concrete.
[3:00:01] <%AzureGale> Defeat Concrete Man to get more concrete
[3:00:01] <%PanicSwytch> Terraform the planet
[3:00:07] <+Hilleltaco> Cover up all these gross slopes and imperfections, unfeeling concrete forever
[3:00:09] <copyritetm> How much would you  say you actually like this game pat? You seem to be genuinly engaged with it which is cool
[3:00:16] <LVL1_Scumbag> Pave down paradise and put up a parking lot
[3:00:16] <%MechArch> neeed that aggregate, water, and portland cement
[3:00:21] <%UltraViolet371> concrete? more like con...deplete
[3:00:26] <+Brightstreak> Pat, use the smart foundations mod. Lay foundations in a grid ***
[3:00:27] <%ThirdWelles> Damn. That's some fuckin range
[3:00:27] <%jarednotwithsubway> thats super efficient foundation building, imma do that shit
[3:00:41] <%holydeviant1> @LVL1_Scumbag Parking lot? Bitch, this is PRODUCTIVE SPACES
[3:00:44] <%putnampuppeteer> If this game becomes to Pat what Binding of Isaac was to Northernlion, I wouldn't be mad
[3:01:16] <%holydeviant1> @putnampuppeteer That's factorio, possibly
[3:01:16] <+Brightstreak> Pat if you use the 4X1 foundation, you can run belts under the floor
[3:01:25] <%holydeviant1> Just not enough game in SF
[3:01:29] <$stoptaknall> @PatStaresAt so pat how much of the map have you explored? did you see monster hunter land yet?
[3:01:38] <ptmpopulatethemoon> Are all the streams so far on pats youtube?
[3:01:58] <%holydeviant1> @ptmpopulatethemoon All one of them, yes, I think
[3:02:11] <%UltraViolet371> @ptmpopulatethemoon yes, but there was only one. plus his twitter. it's a multimedia LP
[3:02:11] <%PanicSwytch> Is there an actual gameplay function to having a coffee mug?
[3:02:22] <%maskedsongbird> @ptmpopulatethemoon The first one is. That's the only one I've seen. If there's others besides that one and this one, I haven't heard about 'em.
[3:02:26] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> peewee's breakfast machine song fits too
[3:02:27] <+Brightstreak> @PanicSwytch nope
[3:02:45] <jorniev> just joined what has pat done to the ecosystem ?
[3:02:52] <%holydeviant1> I actually want a merch mug from the game
[3:03:12] <+cafefunk> So is this just a game to encourage engineering?
[3:03:22] <+cafefunk> What exactly are we building here?
[3:03:38] <s1rcuit> @cafefunk a factory
[3:03:48] <%putnampuppeteer> FUCK
[3:03:48] <%brickwall35> embarrassing
[3:03:49] <+DrSmashy> Making a factory to produce parts to make the factory bigger
[3:03:50] <%ChestMimik> BURN IT ALL DOWN
[3:03:52] <$RealThiele> F
[3:03:53] <NikoAmiko> I believe the end goal is to build a machine to offend god
[3:03:54] <Top_Lane_Duelist> yeah screws suck to make
[3:03:59] <%AzureGale> ohno
[3:03:59] <GunEden> inefficient
[3:04:05] <Top_Lane_Duelist> until you get alternate recipes
[3:04:08] <HeWhoMonologues> Where is the clog?
[3:04:09] <%Jekado> inefficent....
[3:04:10] <HypemasterMonty> How embarrassing
[3:04:14] <blue8moon> not efficient enough WutFace
[3:04:14] <%maskedsongbird> So, fun fact: I work in a manufacturing field and have worked in multiple factories IRL. I bought this game specifically because I was tired of dealing with a mountain of inefficiency on the regular IRL and literally just went "screw it, I'll make my own." lol
[3:04:17] <%Mr_Pylon> it needs time to spin up
[3:04:18] <%Xelhesia> Jenkins is slacking on the job
[3:04:19] <$stoptaknall> @PatStaresAt reamber the bigger the factory the longer it takes for overflow
[3:04:24] <$SGrim> Imagine being below or above 69% LUL
[3:04:28] <%holydeviant1> @NikoAmiko Nuke power and waste removal?
[3:04:30] <%brickwall35> @patstaresat your creativity is inefficient
[3:04:43] <s1rcuit> @maskedsongbird that's a good response
[3:04:50] <$RenegadeHatter> Have you used your scanner yet for learning new recipes?
[3:05:06] <+alphonseisbest> @maskedsongbird hows urs going so far?
[3:05:08] <$Dakuu75> do these machines have durability?
[3:05:11] <HeWhoMonologues> Yes duh
[3:05:18] <LVL1_Scumbag> always
[3:05:24] <+ReallyBigRocks> @Dakuu75 No
[3:05:27] <%Undenizen> you know, all this time we've been working towards modular frames and I have no idea what they do.
[3:05:37] <+cafefunk> So what does this factory produce?
[3:05:41] <LVL1_Scumbag> The true answer is to work in multiples of 10
[3:05:52] <$Dakuu75> @Undenizen lol, I know right.
[3:05:54] <holydeviant1> @Undenizen They appease the corpo sky gods who give us more technology
[3:05:56] <%Undenizen> @cafefunk "product"
[3:06:02] <+ReallyBigRocks> @Undenizen they're bits used to make other bits
[3:06:06] <%UltraViolet371> according to science, everything points the wrong way first
[3:06:17] <+Brightstreak> Pro-TIP: press F, highlight something and middle mouse click to "copy" it. don't have to open build menu each time
[3:06:22] <%ClericOfSparda> Paige is so lucky to not watch you working in 5"s
[3:06:27] <leinadtonu> Hi Pat, Hi chat. How's it hanging?
[3:06:40] <%AzureGale> I love it when a plan comes together
[3:06:41] <%maskedsongbird> @alphonseisbest I'm still in the early game. Eight hours in and I had just gotten the assembler. I'd started running out of room on the initial floor I'd built so I started building downhill to the bottom of the valley. Mad a big-ass floor I figured I'd put the space elevator on.
[3:06:55] <$Dakuu75> you run so fast and when he pulls out the coffee I think he's Caustic from Apex
[3:07:03] <%Jekado> for some reason when you stack them they auto rotate
[3:07:14] <+Brightstreak> it was the wrong direction previously
[3:07:19] <$stoptaknall> um did you put them in oppsite directions
[3:07:22] <xbb1024> that's a merger
[3:07:27] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Do you need Mk3s for these?
[3:07:33] <%r0chelimit> Are all of these running on the same power line? is he using coal or something better?
[3:07:34] <+cafefunk> Is Paige bad at math?
[3:07:40] <KShirahama> top ones were wrong direction
[3:07:44] <%maskedsongbird> The little coffee mug is kind of cute.
[3:07:54] <MayorRev> paige can math I think
[3:08:00] <+cafefunk> She seems like the kind of person who would be good at math taught in a way that made sense to her
[3:08:16] <%jarednotwithsubway> that looks ver nice
[3:08:19] <ape_hawk> did pat orgasm on stream yet?
[3:08:26] <MayorRev> paige is investing in stocks so I hope she's good at math
[3:08:29] <%BoxNavy> yes
[3:08:40] <$Dakuu75> @ape_hawk Multiple times
[3:08:40] <xbb1024> The mk3 belts always felt cheaper then the mk2s, because of the reinforced plate requirement
[3:08:41] <+ReallyBigRocks> I like the criss-cross belt thing you got going on here
[3:08:46] <%maskedsongbird> You'd probably need to use a real-life practical example to teach her. That's what helped me when I was in college and was having trouble w/ math.
[3:08:54] <+SeventhVice> whats up shitlord!
[3:08:54] <+TheMorilo> what a gorgeous minecraft
[3:08:54] <%putnampuppeteer> we need a python pandas hookup for this
[3:08:56] <HeWhoMonologues> Power within
[3:09:12] <%maskedsongbird> Because pure math theory is bullshit
[3:09:28] <ape_hawk> i think this game makes pat more american than canadian
[3:09:32] <%brickwall35> how many NFTs can this factory crank out?
[3:09:32] <$Dakuu75> this reminds me of how I NEVER figured out how to power my city in Sim City 3
[3:09:35] <%Mr_Pylon> and fix tube?
[3:09:35] <%putnampuppeteer> iron_ore-dot-modularframe
[3:09:38] <Top_Lane_Duelist> do power poles grt upgraded later on?
[3:09:59] <s1rcuit> so for anyone playing Outriders what tier do you usually find legendary gear?
[3:10:00] <HeWhoMonologues> Uh oh

[3:10:35] <Sol_Install> poop incoming
[3:10:37] <%Undenizen> don't go and king joffrey on us
[3:10:41] <$SGrim> Properly aligned automation has caused Pat to nut
[3:10:41] <$Dakuu75> lol
[3:10:41] <leinadtonu> did it finally happen?
[3:10:42] <%BubbaRands> Tomato town came back for revenge!
[3:10:45] <MayorRev> pat gonna turn into dust off screen
[3:10:54] <%ashgray2520> ! TOXIC !
[3:11:00] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> jokes on him, his factory keeps churning as he poops
[3:11:01] <MayorRev> ahahaha did he talk about tomato town
[3:11:02] <%ThirdWelles> "And he was never seen again"
[3:11:04] <pokefan9956> wait. wasn't he tipsy earlier?
[3:11:16] <%putnampuppeteer> last online seven years ago
[3:11:17] <%maskedsongbird> @MayorRev "Mister Elmo, I don't feel so good..."
[3:11:27] <MayorRev> we got a
[3:11:32] <$Dakuu75> he can't possibly be hung over all ready
[3:11:36] <MayorRev> number one victory royale
[3:11:39] <%holydeviant1> Pat sees good automation, pat evaporates like Ronnie from Whomp
[3:11:55] <%holydeviant1> "Fifty bucks on the electricity bill every time I turn this on! FIFTY."
[3:11:56] <%putnampuppeteer> just remember, if you puke, the dog will act as an automated cleaning system
[3:12:01] <pokefan9956> puking from the alcohol while shitting his pants
[3:12:02] <%Monkeyweed21> @Dakuu75 baby liver for baby legs
[3:12:04] <leinadtonu> So Pat's a drunk streamer now?
[3:12:17] <HeWhoMonologues> First stream I catch and he up and dies. Neat...
[3:12:35] <%maskedsongbird> @pokefan9956 Ugh...having garbage coming out both ends is the worst...
[3:13:00] <%putnampuppeteer> real talk though, wine is a unique brand of evil among booze
[3:13:00] <%AzureGale> Hope the pat falling over animation doesn't become harsher in hindsight
[3:13:01] <%brickwall35> he's not dead just stinky
[3:13:02] <pokefan9956> so if pat dies, who gets custody
[3:13:03] <pokefan9956> of us
[3:13:15] <%AzureGale> me

[3:18:23] <+ReallyBigRocks> blue is input orange is output
[3:18:24] <%AzureGale> This is why math is important. So that you can videogame efficiently
[3:18:34] <+ReallyBigRocks> Oh wait reverse that
[3:18:45] <%Mendin> The magic words of this stream are "It's Backwards"

[3:19:26] <%holydeviant1> "Uuuooow!  My Twitch chat is gonna kill me!"
[3:19:27] <%maskedsongbird> Nothing feels worse than finding out you screwed up like 7 steps in your ten-step plan and finding out you have to tear the whole thing down and start over.
[3:19:58] <%sakeydo> Huh, ikea vibes
[3:20:10] <%spacedroner1> This game reminds me of those giant Minecraft modpacks with engineering and shit and I super dig it
[3:20:12] <%Treuan> I love this

[3:20:36] <%maskedsongbird> Yo, I haven't seen the travel tubes yet! That's sick!
[3:20:37] <+Hilleltaco> Kreygasm
[3:20:37] <%putnampuppeteer> The fact that the game is so _beautiful_ is what hammers it home
[3:20:38] <%jarednotwithsubway> sick
[3:20:40] <jerobees> Ah yeah that's the good chemical
[3:20:41] <%AzureGale> It's beautiful ;_;
[3:20:42] <%holydeviant1> its boootiful
[3:20:42] <anAngryHamster> Didn't even spill his coffee
[3:20:45] <%Vyskus> That's the beautiful view of raw industry
[3:20:46] <%moonmintparadise> aaaaaah the satisfactory
[3:20:47] <%walternatorz> fuck yeah smog
[3:20:50] <+ReallyBigRocks> Now take a big ol sip of that coffee
[3:20:54] <%jarednotwithsubway> gimme them dopamines
[3:20:55] <GraysonFoxworthy> So preeeety
[3:20:56] <+Brightstreak> where modular frames go?
[3:20:57] <%putnampuppeteer> this makes my chemical become the big chemical
[3:21:01] <+gitgouda> you have created something beautiful and im so proud
[3:21:04] <%spacedroner1> @pokefan9956 What's that? I've actually been out of the Minecraft stuff for some time
[3:21:05] <$stoptaknall> nice so what's the next goal
[3:21:09] <%AzureGale> These tubes remind me of Sonic
[3:21:13] <%putnampuppeteer> big sippy
[3:21:31] <+Freakgurru> yogLove
[3:21:37] <%Undenizen> yeah I need more rods too.
[3:21:43] <%moonmintparadise> I really cant wait for you to reach the point of spaghetti nightmare but you are doing really really well organizing all of your stuff
[3:21:44] <%AzureGale> There's only one rod that matters - your d-*shot*
[3:21:44] <+gitgouda> i love how he does not spill a drop
[3:21:46] <%jarednotwithsubway> alternate recipes help a lot with the amount of production machines you need
[3:22:05] <%mads_valentine> Efficiency is so sexy, Pat.
[3:22:19] <$Dakuu75> the most amazing thing... is how this guy goes through tubes and jumps around like that, and NEVER spills the coffee
[3:22:27] <%AzureGale> Superheroes do good. You're doing well
[3:22:28] <%putnampuppeteer> Rods are fucky in this game
[3:22:33] <pokefan9956> @spacedroner1 fairly recent mod. adds rotational energy to minecraft. waterwheels and windmills can turn gears and power tons of gadgets. conveyer belts. pumps for liquids like water and lava. drills for mining. saws for cutting wood. etc
[3:22:44] <+SoySocks> good evening pat and chat
[3:22:47] <%Vyskus> that's because the coffee is 80% bean and 20% water
[3:22:50] <%Vyskus> it's just mud
[3:22:52] <pokefan9956> @spacedroner1 almost every single item in minecraft can be made in a factory
[3:22:57] <%putnampuppeteer> @pokefan9956 don't do this to me, man.
[3:23:08] <$stoptaknall> you might need more iron at this rate
[3:23:15] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Wait, this is important. Did you ever research the paint gun?
[3:23:24] <%spacedroner1> @pokefan9956 Oooh, nice. Reminds me of the Immersive Engineering mod's big generators
[3:23:30] <%AzureGale> F
[3:23:30] <%maskedsongbird> All of this for rods, plates, and screws? It's a whole complex specifically for the three most basic parts! Which means I need to expand production in my factory. Hmm......
[3:23:33] <%spacedroner1> Rod overflow, you say? ;)
[3:23:34] <%holydeviant1> ROD OVERFLOW
[3:23:35] <pokefan9956> @putnampuppeteer oh, its actual crack cocaine
[3:23:37] <jerobees> YEAH HE LOVES ROD OVERFLOW
[3:23:39] <%PanicSwytch> PANIC

[3:24:04] <$Dakuu75> "I'll show you rod-overflow" heh-heh
[3:24:05] <%putnampuppeteer> I feel like this is a game someone would do meth and furiously hank the pank to
[3:24:10] <MayorRev> how's pats contraption coming along?
[3:24:10] <%spacedroner1> @pokefan9956 Okay I took a quick look at the mod page and I'm actually redownloading Minecraft. You did this to me, remember that!
[3:24:11] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> With the paint gun, you can change the default color of all your buildings at once.
[3:24:14] <Overloard> never has someone shouted rod overflow so enthusiastically
[3:24:26] <$stoptaknall> wait that the wrong one
[3:24:33] <pokefan9956> @spacedroner1 I take full responsibility
[3:24:34] <+Hilleltaco> tags: rod overflow
[3:24:36] <%putnampuppeteer> @Overloard You haven't been on the same websites I have, clearly
[3:24:37] <$stoptaknall> that's screws
[3:24:40] <+PenmanLupine> gonna need some sauce for this spaghetti
[3:24:46] <%spacedroner1> Any game that lets me make spaghetti lines of conveyors is an instant buy tbh
[3:24:49] <$Dakuu75> Belt 1?
[3:24:56] <NikoAmiko> nothing like a temporary mile-long belt of convenience
[3:25:08] <%DrkJP520> Your what?!
[3:25:10] <$Dakuu75> Paige has heard that one before
[3:25:11] <%Mr_Pylon> his rod overfloweth
[3:25:11] <%maskofmichael> That's what she said
[3:25:11] <%putnampuppeteer> me putting on my pants every morning
[3:25:13] <%mads_valentine> What does Paige think of your rods?
[3:25:13] <$HyperionXV> They added lights in the update
[3:25:15] <%Shackle_Rustyford> you get a flashlight
[3:25:15] <%PanicSwytch> Your Rod is awesome
[3:25:15] <+Brightstreak> Pat, use the wall conveyor ports
[3:25:16] <Bigyanno> Pat's face is the face of obsessive compulsive extacy
[3:25:16] <pokefan9956> @spacedroner1 you can also make trains. structures can be placed on minecarts now
[3:25:16] <%Shackle_Rustyford> press B
[3:25:19] <$stoptaknall> @PatStaresAt pat that might be going into screws

[3:25:34] <%putnampuppeteer> Its an RP item
[3:25:34] <$spacedroner1> @pokefan9956 Brings me back to the days of Railcraft
[3:25:39] <$stoptaknall> pat that's screws

[3:26:05] <%MisterRockett> I just realized I still own Minecraft and can just download the mod that turns Minecraft into this.
[3:26:05] <%spacedroner1> Pat was onto something on the podcast, being in the first person perspective makes this type of game sooooo much more appealing
[3:26:06] <%maskedsongbird> @MisterRockett To sip from as you watch over your industry in satisfaction, duh.

[3:30:53] <%PanicSwytch> NIGHTMARE SLAIN
[3:30:55] <%spacedroner1> Does this game run well? I know it's early access but that hasn't stopped me before
[3:30:56] <%putnampuppeteer> DUTDUTDUUTDUT DUUU DUUU DUUU DUT DUU DUUU
[3:31:01] <xbb1024> plate in rod storage

[3:31:10] <%DashXero> Puttin' those goblins to work, eh?
[3:31:11] <$HyperionXV> I saw plates in that second rod overlow chest

[3:31:27] <pi_in_the_sci> there are plates in that box that will jam you stuff eventually
[3:31:29] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> there was a plate in the box
[3:31:32] <Overloard> plate contamination LUL
[3:31:39] <%putnampuppeteer> OTHER ONE
[3:31:42] <%maskedsongbird> God, watching this is just making me think that the next time I boot up the game I'm gonna have to tear down like half my shit and start over...
[3:31:44] <A0N33> SAVED
[3:31:47] <%holydeviant1> phew
[3:31:53] <%maskedsongbird> Good job, Pat
[3:31:54] <+ReallyBigRocks> That could've been so bad lmao
[3:31:56] <LVL1_Scumbag> Crisis averted
[3:31:59] <%UltraViolet371> apocalypse averted
[3:31:59] <pi_in_the_sci> build a damn ladder
[3:32:01] <DexteraXIII> Purity preserved
[3:32:03] <%putnampuppeteer> God the SWEAT I am making from my BODY
[3:32:03] <%BoxNavy> im good :)
[3:32:06] <%ThirdWelles> how the fuck does that even happen
[3:32:20] <$Dakuu75> why is the mug filled with blood
[3:32:29] <jumpyhugs> physics-defying coffee
[3:32:31] <tetrachromaticpotato> @spacedroner1 I've got a 2080, game runs smooth at pretty much max settings for me. Gets a little laggy with enough machines in a small area, but that's about it.
[3:32:32] <%spacedroner1> Looking straight down, but not spilling the coffee
[3:32:35] <%ThirdWelles> Need more rod
[3:32:37] <%putnampuppeteer> @Dakuu75 sometimes you wake up and you know how it is
[3:32:38] <%ThirdWelles> or something
[3:32:40] <xbb1024> dump some of your rods to overflow it
[3:32:41] <blue8moon> NotLikeThis
[3:32:44] <%Vyskus> I feel like I would lose my goddamn mind playing this
[3:32:55] <$stoptaknall> so pat what the next goal is a new tier or unlock?
[3:32:55] <Overloard> R O T O R
[3:33:02] <%Shackle_Rustyford> why is the movement in this game so based lmao
[3:33:05] <pi_in_the_sci> YOU HAVE LADDERS
[3:33:16] <%spacedroner1> @tetrachromaticpotato Cool thanks. I've got a 1080TI so I can probably run it at not-as-great settings. As long as I can be relatively stable FPS I won't expect a perfect experience from early access lol
[3:33:19] <%UltraViolet371> ficsit employees are so aerodynamic, dafuq
[3:33:21] <+ReallyBigRocks> @Vyskus It's a workout for the brain meats for sure
[3:33:27] <%ThirdWelles> Are there signs in this game so you can label shit? I feel like I'd get so lost in my own sauce if I were to play it
[3:33:29] <$Memdosu> Adeptus Mechanicus is slowly starting to happen
[3:33:37] <%putnampuppeteer> yes, herr boivin, you should
[3:33:39] <vile_brand> make it perfect
[3:33:44] <%maskedsongbird> @Dakuu75 If you're not consuming the blood of the innocent to build industry, you're not doing it right. lol
[3:33:48] <+ReallyBigRocks> @spacedroner1 You'll be able to max it out no problem, I can and i have a 980ti
[3:33:50] <%aWanderingKaivo> is that like. non newtonian coffee
[3:33:54] <%MechArch> PogChamp
[3:33:54] <%putnampuppeteer> god, is this the ost german game in history
[3:34:15] <$HyperionXV> You can attach ladders to the top of ladders to extend them if you do run into the max height
[3:34:17] <%Shackle_Rustyford> @ThirdWelles you can paint things to color code them but no signs as of yet
[3:34:19] <%spacedroner1> @ReallyBigRocks PogChamp
[3:34:33] <$stoptaknall> so pats the next goal?
[3:34:36] <%putnampuppeteer> the fact that the coffee never spills. I know people have said this but fuck, man
[3:34:38] <%blaggablag> Fuck yeah RODS!
[3:34:39] <%AzureGale> CREATURE

[3:34:52] <%putnampuppeteer> big tube 4 big boys
[3:34:57] <%maskedsongbird> @ThirdWelles Actually, legit: if there was one improvement to this game I'd suggest to the devs, it'd be the ability to make some proper signage.
[3:35:11] <%aWanderingKaivo> the coffee is the true marvel of engineering
[3:35:17] <tetrachromaticpotato> @ThirdWelles You can make custom beacon names, that's about it. I have a  wordpad doc on my computer just for this game LUL.
[3:35:20] <%spacedroner1> Why can't you put the large creature on a giant hamster wheel to generate energy LUL
[3:35:26] <%putnampuppeteer> part of me wants like, tube  intersections
[3:35:28] <%Shackle_Rustyford> under the belt is fancy
[3:35:41] <%putnampuppeteer> the clip is ba
[3:35:43] <%putnampuppeteer> bad
[3:35:45] <+ReallyBigRocks> clipping is the enemy of efficiency
[3:35:46] <%BoxNavy> we know
[3:36:06] <Bigyanno> Someone clip that Pat doesn't like clipping
[3:36:08] <%putnampuppeteer> the gun is good, the clip is evil

[3:36:43] <tetrachromaticpotato> What tier is he on?
[3:36:56] <pokefan9956> doesn't this game have enemies?
[3:36:57] <%putnampuppeteer> you probably made a whole three tickets
[3:37:00] <Ner234> weeeeeee
[3:37:02] <Chimeraelite> I'm just joining in and the fact that you have an permanently hot cup o' joe makes me cozy
[3:37:03] <%Jekado> yeah... that happens
[3:37:12] <%putnampuppeteer> they don't generate in power zones
[3:37:13] <LVL1_Scumbag> Only 16?
[3:37:14] <xbb1024> you might need to move on to oil
[3:37:15] <$stoptaknall> @PatStaresAt oh pat if you sink a single ticket it unlocks a secret

[3:42:24] <%ThirdWelles> Just do it again.
[3:42:25] <%maskedsongbird> So, do resource nodes ever actually run out, or will mining depots run indefinitely?
[3:42:29] <$stoptaknall> by the way pat how much of the map have you seen ? have you seen monster hunter land yet?
[3:42:36] <%aWanderingKaivo> what did crete do you you, why does an island deserve to be conned
[3:42:39] <%Jekado> you making copper sheets?
[3:42:41] <%maskedsongbird> Fucking awesome.
[3:42:46] <%maskedsongbird> Good to hear.
[3:42:58] <+koriar> if that bugs you too much you can crank up the settings when you make a new game
[3:43:01] <%Daxalog> They dont run out fast.
[3:43:05] <Giztech> you should have multiple powered entries for your tubes, so fast like sonic
[3:43:08] <+ReallyBigRocks> SICK
[3:43:08] <Overloard> they do but they  last a loOOOng while
[3:43:09] <+koriar> makes the resource nodes functionally infinite
[3:43:09] <xbb1024> in reality, it takes years for IRL node to run out
[3:43:10] <HeroToxiko> how ready are you for gas tho
[3:43:11] <%blaggablag> They're also guarded by vicious cockroaches so ther's that
[3:43:11] <LVL1_Scumbag> Resource patches are finite, but map is infinite
[3:43:11] <Laioken13> you can mod them to be infinite

[3:43:30] <%PanicSwytch> RODS OVERFLOWING
[3:43:32] <jerobees> @PatStaresAt it might take some of the factorio stress off if you CRANK UP the size and richness of resource nodes when you create a world

[3:44:33] <+ReallyBigRocks> Fat stacks
[3:44:34] <$stoptaknall> @PatStaresAt so have you done any hardrive hunting? some of the alt recipes are op
[3:44:42] <%spacedroner1> I'm sure some other SciFi thing invented the human transport tubes but I'll always think of Futurama
[3:44:43] <%Ranryu692> Pat is no longer a short stack

[3:44:47] <+olive_js> @PatStaresAt Hour count?

[3:45:03] <%jarednotwithsubway> alternate recipies from that are super good
[3:45:08] <%aWanderingKaivo> how many distinct bases like this do you even have now
[3:45:13] <NavigatorBR> *** - It's got square wheels...!
[3:45:15] <%Mr_Pylon> yeah, right in the lake
[3:45:21] <%Shackle_Rustyford> why move the space elevator?
[3:45:21] <cochramd1992> atop the cliffs, Pat
[3:45:32] <%Shackle_Rustyford> you can build it under the ground if you can glitch down there
[3:45:59] <jumpyhugs> that looks dope
[3:46:03] <Melchior_the_Wise> tbh, that's probably where it would actually be built
[3:46:05] <xbb1024> lake, not ocean
[3:46:07] <%AzureGale> Oh no, is Pat going to create a Mega Man X level
[3:46:09] <%putnampuppeteer> to be fair, that's where a real-life
[3:46:11] <%putnampuppeteer> yeah
[3:46:12] <%spacedroner1> Aww that animation's SO GOOD
[3:46:13] <%putnampuppeteer> yeah what they said
[3:46:18] <$stoptaknall> I built mine under ground I due mean under the literal ground
[3:46:22] <+ReallyBigRocks> It's just so huge that even the very bottom rises out of the lake
[3:46:23] <%maskedsongbird> Man, space elevators are such a cool concept.
[3:46:25] <%AzureGale> Time 2 drain the lake
[3:46:26] <pronooblet> your build is giving me rage hemorrhoids
[3:46:29] <cochramd1992> LUL

[3:46:46] <%maskedsongbird> "Rage hemorrhoids?"
[3:46:46] <Lars_Li> we can't waste the animation
[3:46:46] <%spacedroner1> Put in in space, that's the last place they'd look
[3:46:47] <+ReallyBigRocks> Make a big fuckin platform
[3:46:49] <%DashXero> You'll figure it out.
[3:46:52] <%jarednotwithsubway> the highest point you can reach
[3:46:53] <cochramd1992> atop the cliffs Pat
[3:46:56] <%Mr_Pylon> put it on top of one of the spires?
[3:47:02] <%aWanderingKaivo> was that a god damn elephant
[3:47:02] <+ShadowFoxoon> As far away as possible
[3:47:03] <%TheLeadingTone> make some foundation in the middle of the lake?
[3:47:07] <+olive_js> put it on the ground
[3:47:07] <Giztech> why not have it float above the water?
[3:47:08] <%Shackle_Rustyford> are water sources infinite like mining nodes?
[3:47:09] <+ReallyBigRocks> God it's so huge
[3:47:09] <%moonmintparadise> @jarednotwithsubway imagination ?
[3:47:17] <%PanicSwytch> Building a Space elevator was the plot to Megaman X8
[3:47:17] <%Mendin> Yeah just put a platform on the lake
[3:47:17] <%ThirdWelles> Just do a big shitty foundation in the lake
[3:47:32] <DrillStopsNoCops> call that Space Elevator the 'Keeper of the Lake'
[3:47:33] <xbb1024> put down a concrete foundation first?
[3:47:36] <%alcors_wisdom> id say stick it on the tallest mountain around
[3:47:40] <%spacedroner1> Space elevators are rad because once we have a few the costs of doing shit in space go down by a lot
[3:47:46] <%BoxNavy> nooooo
[3:47:47] <%jarednotwithsubway> far far away
[3:47:56] <%spacedroner1> As far as I understand anyway
[3:48:00] <+ReallyBigRocks> You can just put the stuff in by hand
[3:48:01] <mai_cu> make a platform above the water
[3:48:07] <vile_brand> can you make a platform and put it there?
[3:48:09] <%alcors_wisdom> yeah but think of how cool it would look with coils of material flowing up the mountain to it
[3:48:19] <Top_Lane_Duelist> you can give the stuff amnually
[3:48:25] <%jarednotwithsubway> if you build a foundation you can
[3:48:27] <%Mendin> Pat you have 5,000 concrete just pave a lake platform
[3:48:32] <tetrachromaticpotato> With the current version of the game I never ended up running lines to mine.... could pretty much carry everything over in 1 run.
[3:48:45] <%Xelhesia> what does the elevator do?
[3:48:52] <tetrachromaticpotato> probably a good idea for the future tho
[3:48:59] <CrimsonFox777> It elevates things.
[3:49:00] <%juxtest> Why not build a space escalator instead
[3:49:09] <%jarednotwithsubway> get that shit!!!
[3:49:12] <%maskedsongbird> @spacedroner1 I imagine that the concept of a spaceport becomes more feasible at that point. Why have precarious space vehicle launches into and out of orbit when you can just build the damn thing in space to begin with?
[3:49:17] <%Broand> Clear that shit out son
[3:49:20] <Top_Lane_Duelist> use bat
[3:49:20] <%putnampuppeteer> murder that mofo
[3:49:20] <%Shackle_Rustyford> i FUCKING HATE THESE
[3:49:22] <s1rcuit> @Xelhesia it's an elevator that goes past the atmosphere
[3:49:28] <LVL1_Scumbag> NATURE
[3:49:41] <tetrachromaticpotato> fireflies are the worst enemy. Give me the radioactive spitters any day.
[3:49:45] <%maskedsongbird> Truly, nature is the true enemy.

[3:50:21] <%MelBrooksKA> How did you not see that...
[3:50:32] <%putnampuppeteer> this thing's gonna predict everything pat does and write articles on it
[3:50:37] <%Xelhesia> the elevator should launch gundams into space in a future update
[3:50:42] <%jarednotwithsubway> research at the MAM
[3:50:42] <%AzureGale> LUL
[3:50:46] <%spacedroner1> @spacedroner1 Precarious and expensive too. Like the space shuttles and such are reusable but the fuel cost per pound of shit going into space is a big hurdle
[3:50:52] <+ReallyBigRocks> Budding entrepreneur refuses to step 20 feet away from his factory
[3:51:08] <+ReallyBigRocks> You could literally see it from your factory lol
[3:51:12] <%aWanderingKaivo> does the coffee do anything mechanically
[3:51:22] <%spacedroner1> The stinky space bees are away from the factory why would he leave
[3:51:24] <Top_Lane_Duelist> SAVE before you research, you can savescum different recipes if you get ones you dont want
[3:51:29] <%notsoy> the unlocks from the MAM can get you an item that does full heals
[3:51:31] <+ReallyBigRocks> @aWanderingKaivo You can drink it
[3:51:33] <%putnampuppeteer> pubby?
[3:51:42] <$stoptaknall> @PatStaresAt so how much of the map have you explore? did you see monster land yet
[3:51:44] <+wizard_of_diamonds> @aWanderingKaivo Afraid not
[3:52:03] <%alcors_wisdom> does pat know how to launch with the vaccum tubes?

[3:52:18] <%putnampuppeteer> you know what you can do for ten minutes
[3:52:19] <Srthunda> try petting the dog

[3:52:46] <%maskedsongbird> @PatStaresAt Is this desert factory an expansion of the plant you started ack in the green valley of the first stream?
[3:52:50] <%SirGO0SE> ace combat PogChamp
[3:52:57] <%maskedsongbird> Or is it an entirely new factory?

[3:53:13] <ape_hawk> pat, do they call you the space cowboy?
[3:53:18] <CrimsonFox777> Elevate the build space
[3:53:29] <%MelBrooksKA> @maskedsongbird New save, he showed the intro on a twitter thread
[3:53:31] <tetrachromaticpotato> If I remember from his twitter, this is a fresh start from the valley save.
[3:53:32] <+Shacklebox> Jesus pat breathe through your mouth
[3:53:36] <+ReallyBigRocks> @maskedsongbird This is a different save
[3:53:41] <$Dakuu75> YEAH Science~!
[3:53:45] <%maskedsongbird> Ah, gotcha. Thanks.
[3:53:48] <$stoptaknall> @PatStaresAt a tip the second you have coal power start harddrive hunting you can pigeon hole the recipes and get the ones you want right off the bat
[3:53:51] <%jarednotwithsubway> so fuckin cool
[3:53:51] <+ReallyBigRocks> *sip*
[3:53:54] <%putnampuppeteer> as it spreads its legs to the sky

[3:53:57] <+D00msDayDan> i love this animation
[3:53:57] <+olive_js> This animation is so fucking cool.
[3:53:59] <%MelBrooksKA> spaaaaaaace
[3:54:00] <%alcors_wisdom> its less of a space elevator and more of an orbital teather
[3:54:02] <xbb1024> This is engineering, not science
[3:54:15] <GunEden> lewd
[3:54:30] <%atteroproxy> That animation makes me feel good
[3:54:36] <%alcors_wisdom> @GunEden uncensored hand holding

[3:54:37] <%maskedsongbird> @xbb1024 Engineering is just science with a practical application.
[3:54:50] <iosephe> it chonky
[3:54:53] <+Strigiform> now tell them to pick up the space pole again because you want to move the elevator 5m left
[3:55:01] <%ThirdWelles> @alcors_wisdom ... That's core part of a space elevator
[3:55:12] <%MelBrooksKA> But science is science with a practical application...
[3:55:18] <%putnampuppeteer> I was a scientist at one point. Engineering is science but actually worth the pain.
[3:55:39] <Laioken13> lmao engineers
[3:55:42] <%maskedsongbird> @putnampuppeteer Went to college for engineering. Can confirm.
[3:55:43] <rReizs> oh my god no need to add another foundation to the ramp to go further with ramps
[3:55:47] <%UltraViolet371> nature circumvented
[3:55:52] <%alcors_wisdom> science is the theoretical engineering is the practical
[3:56:00] <%atteroproxy> Cooking is science
[3:56:10] <tetrachromaticpotato> Science gets published Engineering gets built. That's pretty much the difference.
[3:56:13] <%alcors_wisdom> cooking is chemistry
[3:56:23] <%MelBrooksKA> Engineering has theory too...
[3:56:25] <theloverobot> How do you not spill your coffee in the pneumatic tubes?
[3:56:28] <%atteroproxy> Chemistry is science
[3:56:32] <%Broand> Hey maybe you'll get lucky in your research
[3:56:36] <%spacedroner1> Boil water? What am I, a chemist?
[3:56:40] <%ThirdWelles> As someone going to school to be a mechanic: Haha nerds doing math without a purpose
[3:56:40] <%alcors_wisdom> science is weak wojak engineering is chat
[3:56:44] <%atteroproxy> yes
[3:56:56] <%Jekado> those take a LONG TIME
[3:56:59] <+ReallyBigRocks> The coffee mug has a localized gravity field to keep the drink in
[3:57:04] <%Jekado> all elevator parts have to be machine made
[3:57:06] <%atteroproxy> Now make me a potion chemist
[3:57:07] <%maskedsongbird> Engineer (noun.): A person who makes nature his or her bitch.
[3:57:11] <rReizs> have to use an assembler
[3:57:21] <+ReallyBigRocks> Pat just use X to look at recipes
[3:57:21] <%putnampuppeteer> he's drinking ferrofluid. the mug is a magnet
[3:57:25] <%VoidBaronJules> non-newtonian coffee?
[3:57:26] <%alcors_wisdom> @ReallyBigRocks then how can you drink it by tipping it up
[3:57:35] <cochramd1992> the highest tech of coffee mugs
[3:57:37] <iosephe> Trucks?
[3:57:39] <$stoptaknall> not yet you'll need it in the next tier
[3:57:42] <jerobees> You succ the coffee in
[3:57:43] <%putnampuppeteer> @alcors_wisdom big sip
[3:57:55] <%MelBrooksKA> I think its a space elevator item
[3:58:05] <%alcors_wisdom> need to outsuck the tubes got it
[3:58:07] <+ReallyBigRocks> @alcors_wisdom Theres a switch on the handle that turns it off
[3:58:10] <%MelBrooksKA> One mine
[3:58:21] <%walternatorz> time to find more copper?
[3:58:21] <%spacedroner1> I would spend too much time in this game just riding on my conveyors and going "WEEEE production!"
[3:58:27] <Psyramics> the factory must grow
[3:58:27] <%alcors_wisdom> the second answer was much better
[3:58:30] <%putnampuppeteer> LUL
[3:58:33] <%Broand> Pure node?
[3:58:36] <iosephe> lol
[3:58:48] <%AzureGale> Poor unloved copper node
[3:58:57] <%UltraViolet371> wow, what a spooky dilapidated ghost town of a copper mine
[3:59:00] <%Broand> Check your mam when that research is finished, you might have some solutions to your problems
[3:59:02] <%MelBrooksKA> It probably becomes way more important when you get computers
[3:59:07] <+ReallyBigRocks> Why disconnect stuff to turn it off when everything has toggle switches
[3:59:12] <$stoptaknall> @PatStaresAt  I would wait till the hard drive done see if it's copper related
[3:59:16] <pi_in_the_sci> YAY
[3:59:18] <%putnampuppeteer> YEYEYE
[3:59:20] <%alcors_wisdom> have you ever seen the worse base in satisfactory pat?
[3:59:24] <%Shackle_Rustyford> ThInK VeRtIcAlLy
[3:59:28] <HeroToxiko> oh yeah you have to build a space elevator LUL
[3:59:30] <%brickwall35> dig up idiot
[3:59:32] <+ReallyBigRocks> Ahh
[3:59:51] <TOONFOOD> this gonna trip the power right?
[3:59:55] <%Shackle_Rustyford> sky factory
[4:00:00] <$stoptaknall> you could try to fine a different node
[4:00:00] <Cory_the_Dinosaur> dogs can't dig up
[4:00:03] <%alcors_wisdom> make a mega condo of machines
[4:00:06] <SonicD4> how goes the factory?
[4:00:18] <%Monkeyweed21> AW YEA JUST GOT MY FIRST VACCINE
[4:00:26] <%maskedsongbird> Diggy hole up into sky.
[4:00:28] <$stoptaknall> nice
[4:00:32] <%alcors_wisdom> ha "ore" good one
[4:00:35] <HeroToxiko> nice
[4:00:35] <%maskedsongbird> Congrats, Monkeyweed
[4:00:37] <s1rcuit> @Monkeyweed21 congrats
[4:00:42] <jerobees> @Monkeyweed21 NICE
[4:00:51] <+coachacpatterson> KappaWealth
[4:00:54] <%spacedroner1> hell yeah
[4:00:55] <CatsDrunkonCopper> build it on top of the modular factory
[4:01:01] <%bevyrage> the overhang is fucking you?
[4:01:04] <%AzureGale> Pat is being fucked by an overhang
[4:01:05] <%Monkeyweed21> I can feel Bill Gate's power flowing through my veins
[4:01:16] <%aWanderingKaivo> pat a bottom confirmed
[4:01:17] <$stoptaknall> @PatStaresAt you could build a platform on the over hang
[4:01:26] <%Monkeyweed21> build beyond the overhang
[4:01:27] <Melchior_the_Wise> @Monkeyweed21 Power, might just be space aids.
[4:01:31] <rReizs> do you respond to "xbox" commands now
[4:01:40] <CrimsonFox777> Pat is being fucked by an overhang while fucking a boot, confirmed.
[4:01:43] <%Pyrojak> concrete concrete!
[4:01:54] <+ReallyBigRocks> @Monkeyweed21 Oh shit the 5G microchip gives you superpowers?
[4:02:05] <%Shackle_Rustyford> you can get clearance with smaller foundations
[4:02:15] <$stoptaknall> you could make a platform on the overhang
[4:02:24] <%Shackle_Rustyford> you dont HAVE to use 4' height
[4:02:35] <%ashgray2520> You could build off of the overhang. Just ship the copper straight up and start from there.
[4:02:41] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> the smaller one will too
[4:02:42] <%putnampuppeteer> god I spent three hours watching a man build a factory
[4:02:48] <%VoidBaronJules> Drizzt is in a new game
[4:03:07] <%jarednotwithsubway> then if you put a layer of the 1 meter foundations alighned with the top and bottom of the 4 meter ones you can have a layer of belts connecting the floors with vertical conveyors
[4:03:48] <%Shackle_Rustyford> sandwich method
[4:03:50] <%putnampuppeteer> jman your brain's too big rn'
[4:04:10] <xbb1024> I recommend leaving a utility space between floors for belts
[4:04:33] <+D00msDayDan> you can run belts through frame foundation
[4:04:36] <%putnampuppeteer> moor floor?
[4:04:36] <%Shackle_Rustyford> you create 4 1 foot heigh foundations
[4:04:39] <%Shackle_Rustyford> then delete the middle
[4:04:43] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Stack four flat foundations, delete the middle two
[4:04:46] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Nope
[4:04:47] <%spacedroner1> @VoidBaronJules Tell me more
[4:04:47] <+ReallyBigRocks> Do what jared said
[4:05:03] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Four flat foundations with the two middle deleted makes a belt level
[4:05:04] <$stoptaknall> Stack four flat foundations, delete the middle two
[4:05:08] <%alcors_wisdom> like that but with foundations
[4:05:14] <+ReallyBigRocks> Build a 4m foundation then you can snap 1m ones to the top and bottom sides of it
[4:05:19] <+Shacklebox> stack em flat
[4:05:23] <%Shackle_Rustyford> no the 1 foot
[4:05:24] <%Trenr> the small ones
[4:05:26] <%Shackle_Rustyford> not the 4
[4:05:26] <+ReallyBigRocks> No pat the thin ones
[4:05:26] <%ThirdWelles> A cutout/hollow foundation
[4:05:29] <$stoptaknall> no 1m ones
[4:05:31] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Those are not flat foundations
[4:05:33] <rReizs> foundations can float
[4:05:33] <pi_in_the_sci> the skinny ones
[4:05:34] <%jarednotwithsubway> that but for the 1 meter foundations
[4:05:34] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> The 4x1s
[4:05:41] <SociallyAwkwardToaster> the thin ones pat
[4:05:42] <%ashgray2520> the 8 x 1 ones, not the 8 x 4 ones
[4:05:42] <%moonmintparadise> belts
[4:05:43] <Rwctt> 1 meter foundations
[4:05:43] <$stoptaknall> 1m ones
[4:05:44] <+ReallyBigRocks> The short ones not the tall ones
[4:05:46] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> You did it wrong dude
[4:05:47] <%putnampuppeteer> two tortillas around chonkyboy
[4:05:49] <LVL1_Scumbag> FLAOT
[4:06:01] <+Hilleltaco> To create a gap between floors for stuff to go, I imagine
[4:06:02] <Rwctt> it can fit belts
[4:06:03] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Yep, belt level
[4:06:03] <%putnampuppeteer> beltland
[4:06:05] <jerobees> Now put belts in there
[4:06:06] <SociallyAwkwardToaster> pat pls
[4:06:07] <CrimsonFox777> Screw gravity
[4:06:13] <%alcors_wisdom> you can run belts through the floor on either side
[4:06:15] <%Jekado> its to make a service line
[4:06:17] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Hide all your belting and just use verticals straight to the inputs and outputs
[4:06:17] <$stoptaknall> belts can go though
[4:06:18] <%EternalJedi> hide belts under the floor
[4:06:21] <%aWanderingKaivo> space efficient though
[4:06:26] <%jarednotwithsubway> it works, make a whole layer and try
[4:06:29] <%Trenr> it's the smallest space that you can get in and place belts, and it's the same size as a big foundation
[4:06:31] <A0N33> IT's like cable management, it hides your mess away from you~
[4:06:32] <%Broand> Hyper dense space efficiency
[4:06:34] <SociallyAwkwardToaster> Just think of it like cable management in a PC
[4:06:35] <%moonmintparadise> yeah you can hide beltsand stack them
[4:06:50] <%MrUnKnownAlien> hide the spagettii
[4:06:54] <+forebringer> that seems interesting for a nice redesign
[4:06:56] <%ArcanumArcanum> why hide your belts in a game about making belts?
[4:06:58] <%maskofmichael> Ha ha, you fell
[4:06:58] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> So you have a smelter level, belt level, constructor level, belt level, assembly level, and so on
[4:07:00] <%putnampuppeteer> and not a drop spille
[4:07:00] <rReizs> the belts would be running under your floor once its done
[4:07:07] <%Shackle_Rustyford> you could always just play wide instead of tall
[4:07:09] <Bigyanno> This man has the best coffee balancing skills in the univeres
[4:07:10] <%alcors_wisdom> you very much could its true
[4:07:27] <$stoptaknall> @PatStaresAt oh check the MAM the Hard drive should be done see if you got lucky
[4:07:37] <LVL1_Scumbag> Pat making Midgar complete with metal sky pizza
[4:07:45] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Maybe if Pat learns the vertical belt click to position sound, he will embrace verticality
[4:07:47] <xbb1024> do whatever is efficient space management
[4:08:00] <dracovastor> Wow  he figured it out
[4:08:03] <+ReallyBigRocks> Also you can slide under belts
[4:08:03] <%jarednotwithsubway> oh yeah you could check on the hard drive as well
[4:08:14] <+ReallyBigRocks> CAST SCREWS!!!!!
[4:08:16] <%putnampuppeteer> YE YE YE
[4:08:18] <%alcors_wisdom> ah yes just create a work space directly over the smoke stack of a furnace brilliant
[4:08:21] <xbb1024> that one is good, no more rods needed
[4:08:23] <+ReallyBigRocks> Thats the good one
[4:08:25] <%jarednotwithsubway> YES
[4:08:25] <$stoptaknall> oh nice the third one
[4:08:31] <%Shackle_Rustyford> haha time to rework the entire factory
[4:08:33] <%putnampuppeteer> BIG SCREW FOR BIG BOYS
[4:08:33] <pi_in_the_sci> that's efficiency on screws is nice
[4:08:33] <rReizs> ingots straight to screws
[4:08:34] <%UltraViolet371> that seems amazing, i need that
[4:08:39] <+ShadowFoxoon> IRON TO SCREWS
[4:08:45] <%jarednotwithsubway> there are 89 hard drives in the game
[4:08:47] <%Shackle_Rustyford> ingots straight into screws is fucking broken
[4:08:49] <Top_Lane_Duelist> screwssssssssssssssssss
[4:08:53] <Rwctt> screws seem nice
[4:08:54] <%MrUnKnownAlien> oh shit screw time
[4:08:56] <%Trenr> oh hey casted screws
[4:08:59] <Top_Lane_Duelist> valuable
[4:09:00] <%jarednotwithsubway> screws is amazing
[4:09:08] <+ReallyBigRocks> Cast screws is very good
[4:09:09] <%Trenr> casted screws is top tier
[4:09:09] <+ShadowFoxoon> The more basic the material, the better
[4:09:11] <%jarednotwithsubway> 1 less layer of constructors
[4:09:11] <xbb1024> how good they are depends on what resources you happen to have a lot of at the time
[4:09:14] <Top_Lane_Duelist> pole to screw production is ass, all the alternates are much better
[4:09:18] <%Mr_Pylon> bye rods?
[4:09:22] <%Broand> Casted screws is great, good luck redoing your entire factory for it
[4:09:23] <jerobees> Tear it all down
[4:09:25] <+ReallyBigRocks> Gotta redo everything that uses screws now lmao
[4:09:31] <rReizs> time to retool the factory
[4:09:36] <%BoxNavy> too bad :)
[4:09:37] <xbb1024> For future setups
[4:09:40] <+MisterAvry> sip
[4:09:40] <Top_Lane_Duelist> theres one for steel that's even better
[4:09:42] <%putnampuppeteer> that's reasonable
[4:09:45] <pi_in_the_sci> but you could remove a good bit of it
[4:09:46] <+ReallyBigRocks> Do it another stream or on your off time lol
[4:09:46] <+ShadowFoxoon> Too late to not
[4:09:47] <%jarednotwithsubway> fair enougj
[4:09:47] <CrimsonFox777> Sorry Pat, but that is the price of OPTIMIZATION
[4:10:00] <$stoptaknall> @PatStaresAt tdon't have too just get rid of the rod part
[4:10:08] <%Mr_Pylon> you've got the ROD OVERFLOW anyways might as well use it for now
[4:10:17] <%jarednotwithsubway> yeah re do it later
[4:10:28] <+MisterAvry> was the air always pink?
[4:10:32] <%spacedroner1> If it ain't broke don't fix it tbh
[4:10:32] <$stoptaknall> fair
[4:10:33] <Top_Lane_Duelist> dont need to rebuild, just cnahge constructor recipe
[4:10:40] <+doug_famous> But what if it was MORE fine?
[4:10:43] <%MrUnKnownAlien> he right though
[4:10:44] <seth45er> yeah its working fine, make more factory
[4:10:44] <Pixel_Butts> oh shit! im in time for the "Pat's latest addiction" stream
[4:10:48] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> There is a specific sound that plays when a lift end clicks to an input/output. Means you've placed things right.
[4:10:52] <HeWhoMonologues> Except?
[4:11:00] <%Shackle_Rustyford> hed have to reroute all his rods back into overflow
[4:11:09] <Top_Lane_Duelist> you could jsut change rod recipe constructor to new alt screw recipe
[4:11:11] <%Shackle_Rustyford> and move his ingots
[4:11:13] <+ShadowFoxoon> Says Pat till he starts waking up in the middle of the night about his wasted optimization
[4:11:20] <+ReallyBigRocks> Also it changes the ratios of everything
[4:11:29] <%Mr_Pylon> yeah the rod overflow would become rod jammed up
[4:11:33] <%Shackle_Rustyford> pats using overflow anyways
[4:11:42] <%Shackle_Rustyford> ratios are basically just whatever works
[4:11:45] <%aWanderingKaivo> aw yeah jam those rods
[4:11:51] <Djinnazz> You're gonna start having dreams about this.
[4:12:07] <$stoptaknall> the overflow is at the end not the beginning
[4:12:09] <%Broand> I'd have gone for quickwire stators, because you have lots of quickwire and no stators
[4:12:12] <%Shackle_Rustyford> oh yeah this game tetris effects you super hard
[4:12:14] <%putnampuppeteer> @Djinnazz "Gonna"?
[4:12:20] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Build a conveyor wall and put a foundation above it. Put the constructor hanging one tick off the foundation and a lift will connect the conveyor wall directly to the input.
[4:12:23] <%MrUnKnownAlien> man he got so luck about that screw recipe
[4:12:23] <%jarednotwithsubway> yeah some time in the future if you feel like it redo it i mean
[4:12:29] <iosephe> what if tho
[4:12:29] <+ReallyBigRocks> The savings is in power consumption mostly, and neatness
[4:12:35] <LVL1_Scumbag> But couldn't it work better?
[4:12:36] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> And it makes a sound.
[4:12:44] <JonKhan> Alternate screw recipe is possibly my favourite recipe early before you make a mega factory
[4:12:45] <Top_Lane_Duelist> fair
[4:12:50] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Wall with a conveyor hole.
[4:12:51] <+BettyMwwaahh> you need tickets for that
[4:12:52] <$stoptaknall> under wall
[4:12:53] <+ReallyBigRocks> The wall with conveyor holes in it @PatStaresAt
[4:12:53] <%tank7013> Awesome shop stuff I think
[4:12:54] <%jarednotwithsubway> the awesome shop thing with conveyor holes
[4:12:55] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> In ficsit.
[4:13:18] <Top_Lane_Duelist> the wall with the conveyor holes
[4:13:20] <%MrUnKnownAlien> he needs to buy that recipe
[4:13:26] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> The wall holes really help with building up.
[4:13:31] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Gotta love your wall holes.
[4:13:45] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Paint gun!
[4:13:49] <%jarednotwithsubway> full heal i think'
[4:13:58] <+MisterAvry> siiip
[4:14:03] <%Littlecjmajor> Littlecjmajor subscribed at Tier 2. They've subscribed for 12 months! 
[4:14:04] <%spacedroner1> Aww yeah the good old SciFi medicine inhaler
[4:14:08] <%notsoy> the inhaler is a full heal, extremely good
[4:14:12] <%putnampuppeteer> hell yeah, carl weezer
[4:14:15] <%p0tat0ch1p5> Does this game require long sessions or is it easy to pick up and play a little at a time?
[4:14:19] <+MisterAvry> the coffee mug is a wonderful "idle tool"
[4:14:22] <Top_Lane_Duelist> full heals 4 lyfe
[4:14:26] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Paint gun is vital for aesthetic.
[4:14:58] <%jarednotwithsubway> paint gun is good, and you can set a preset that affects all current machines
[4:15:06] <Top_Lane_Duelist> sprinting at top speed with a cup of caffeine
[4:15:18] <Top_Lane_Duelist> and not spilling a drop
[4:15:19] <%TheWinged7> !uptime
[4:15:20] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 15m.
[4:15:24] <%moonmintparadise> 4:15am here, pat   What a ride   Super relaxing.
[4:15:26] <+D00msDayDan> time flies when you're automating
[4:15:27] <%spacedroner1> As someone who has a dumb esophagus that doesn't like pills larger than a ibuprofen I 100% support the inhaler based scifi medicine future
[4:15:28] <%linSP> real machines never sleep
[4:15:37] <%TheWinged7> 2:16 pm here
[4:15:38] <+MisterAvry> no sleep, factory
[4:15:50] <%maskedsongbird> Today I learned the difference between my timezone and Montreal's. Apparently it's about 3 hours. Neat.
[4:15:50] <%spacedroner1> Why sleep when you can INDUSTRY
[4:15:59] <%TheWinged7> its been a nice distraction while waiting on wpprovals at work
[4:16:00] <%MrUnKnownAlien> he could leave the game running all night and still get progress done
[4:16:10] <%putnampuppeteer> 10 16
[4:16:21] <Top_Lane_Duelist> from kitchen
[4:16:28] <%AzureGale> Duct tape the new factory parts onto the old factory parts
[4:16:29] <%Pyrojak> good plan. Looks fucking sick btw
[4:16:34] <%spacedroner1> The opportunity cost of rebuilding the factory instead of just making a better OTHER factory doesn't seem worth it. If it works it's fine imo
[4:16:34] <Psyramics> until they add bots that let you deconstruct the whole thing in one go, yeah
[4:16:38] <+ReallyBigRocks> But then you end up with multiple giant factories that are mostly doing the same thing
[4:16:39] <xbb1024> agreed. there are lots of nodes to find
[4:16:44] <ThirdPersonPhil> Weird only 1 hour difference, i guess that is because our president abolished day light savings
[4:17:08] <+MisterAvry> that big weird factory is beautiful is a way
[4:17:30] <dabeaminator> Is there a goal to this game, or is it just building for the sake of building?
[4:17:38] <HeWhoMonologues> We built this city!
[4:17:39] <JonKhan> How close to oil are ya? because there's a pretty legit area nearby where I usually set up.
[4:17:40] <+Partialrecall2> the purest plates
[4:17:43] <HeWhoMonologues> Well you did
[4:17:44] <+queaks> did you show car?
[4:17:47] <%maskedsongbird> Fucking sick. Nice job so far, Pat.
[4:17:48] <%putnampuppeteer> hell yeah
[4:17:50] <+JonWhoLovesFlatWomen> long way
[4:17:50] <+MisterAvry> I love that you're into this shit, Pat
[4:17:56] <+treybivins> made it here at the end of dystopian city builder
[4:18:00] <%UltraViolet371> next tier is sick
[4:18:01] <%VoidBaronJules> @queaks car was bad
[4:18:13] <+ReallyBigRocks> Soon you get OIL
[4:18:16] <cochramd1992> OIL

[4:19:25] <+Hilleltaco> @dabeaminator After you build the space elevator, there well be sets of items you need to deliver with it to unlock more upgrade tiers. Can't say if anything happens once you hit the end of that as I'm not there yet, but the game's also not done

[4:24:00] <Thepothero> That s pretty cool
[4:24:01] <%spacedroner1> Subnautica freaked me out too though, for real
[4:24:11] <Top_Lane_Duelist> of course
[4:24:17] <%Solarint> subnautica is one of the only games that genuinely scares the shit out of me in a primal way
[4:24:27] <+ReallyBigRocks> You got cast screws on literally the first HD tho so honestly IDK what else you'd REALLY want
[4:24:40] <%spacedroner1> Subnautica taught me that I fucking hate the ocean
[4:24:42] <%YakumoYomi> Play Subnautica in VR. It's janky, but fun.
[4:24:47] <dabeaminator> Isn't Subnautica intended to freak you out? It's like a pseudo horror game.

[4:25:05] <%Trenr> like, you'll use parts that need screws
[4:25:07] <%Solarint> @YakumoYomi my first time playing subnautica was in VR
[4:25:10] <xbb1024> yeah, there's lots of stuff that needs screws
[4:25:13] <KShirahama> unless you get alternative recepies
[4:25:13] <+ShadowFoxoon> Screws are such a vase item they're used all the time
[4:25:13] <xbb1024> like computers
