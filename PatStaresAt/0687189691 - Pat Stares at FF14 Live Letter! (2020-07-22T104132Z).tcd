[0:20:26] <+sonicitus> COOL MECH
[0:20:26] <RubberFistFight> @Barrarious part of the reason there's so many OTC antihistamines is because they hit people differently. Try Zyrtec instead (if you can get generic you're looking for Cetirizine)

[0:22:17] <%michingmallecho> 20 million goes brrrr
[0:22:23] <%SomeSageAdvice> 20 million is a lot better than what WoW is doing now lol
[0:22:23] <BallerSwagBro9k> @skyheys But will it run on my McDonald electronic 90s toy?
[0:22:24] <BluBox> BuyGOLD.scam
[0:22:24] <%angel949> neat
[0:22:26] <$OmegaWeltall> 50% of that is RMT bots LUL
[0:22:28] <%Ciglossonjr> 700 current subs atm
[0:22:30] <%radda343> no mmo does
[0:22:32] <RubberFistFight> Oh same as Blizzard then
[0:22:32] <KoyaMusa> no way, zgfdsgdfg ahjdgdag is just a hyur roleplaying a roe
[0:22:32] <@SoFarFetched> wonder how many of those have stopped playing
[0:22:32] <bbHighvalor> Every Sales. a WIN
[0:22:36] <+alphonseisbest> hey FF14 just caught up to FGO LUL
[0:22:37] <%sweetlemon5> cant understand a thing but I share their excitement
[0:22:38] <%Ciglossonjr> it's all just one FC
[0:22:38] <SolsticeZro> as usual, raid tier downtime is boring
[0:22:41] <%Ebony_Crowe> That "Lies and Truth" shirt though/
[0:22:43] <skyheys> @ballerswagbro9k Honestly? maybe
[0:22:48] <%BubbaRands> At least 5 million are bots LUL
[0:22:48] <flatcapgame> Wow stopped around 2016
[0:22:48] <+Rheyr> Goodmorning Patru-chan~
[0:22:48] <NeonBleu> !uptime
[0:22:49] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 22m 59s.
[0:22:53] <%Daniel_Is_I> WoW used to and then they started dropping so they stopped
[0:22:54] <tictoc_clock> WoW only did that to flex on competition
[0:22:57] <snowmanse> WoW did, before they had an expansion that caused them to lose half their subs
[0:22:59] <RubberFistFight> they stopped publishing around the same time that sub numbers plummeted from repeated shitty expansions and content drought. Convenient, that. @PatStaresAt
[0:23:01] <+Yakobro> @OmegaWeltall rmt stuff is probably on stolen accounts, I doubt it's worth actually buying the game each time
[0:23:07] <+Greywyn00> LIES AND TRUTH
[0:23:07] <%fetrigon> @moobot LUL
[0:23:08] <@SoFarFetched> elmo angy for subs
[0:23:11] <%Solutha> They stopped once they fucked up so bad everyone stopped

[0:23:39] <+CaribbeanMonkey> Always loved the transparency of the FF14 devs these live letters are great
[0:23:40] <+datmegamandeeeee> Oh boy, we just saw a ton of shit

[0:24:06] <jhonxiolonn> is FFXIV a subscription game or you just buy it once?
[0:24:13] <%sweetlemon5> @MarcAfterDarc Night night

[0:24:25] <+king_of_beggars> I went to sleep at 2:30 and woke up exactly at 4, thank god for sleep apnea.
[0:24:27] <$OmegaWeltall> Subscribiptionv
[0:24:36] <flatcapgame> wait does pat speak JP?
[0:24:39] <@SoFarFetched> and pat is seeing the subs on his end through a discord live translating it.
[0:24:40] <bsmusic> Pog

[0:24:42] <Arnschen> They did say 5.3 would be the end of the Shadowbringers story
[0:24:42] <Leafboi125> Poggers
[0:24:43] <KoyaMusa> i'm really hoping garlemald isn't sidelined and we do get to go to it in an expansion proper
[0:24:48] <Neo_Kaiser> Will Pat stream Fantasy Strike?
[0:24:50] <BallerSwagBro9k> dont strem

[0:25:17] <jhonxiolonn> Pat really likes his FF stuff
[0:25:20] <+bugz_munny> They're pointing at the Garlemald stand pretty hard though
[0:25:22] <BallerSwagBro9k> WATCK UK VERISON LUL
[0:25:23] <%Ciglossonjr> I just hit the viera forest, how much longer do I have?
[0:25:25] <RoxMoxie> They kind of have to make new shit up, or else every single bad guy in the FFXIV universe is kind of dealt with after Zenos
[0:25:25] <+king_of_beggars> I'm hoping for another planet. Going back to the stupid war feels like such a step backwards after Shadowbringers.
[0:25:28] <%fetrigon> psaGib psaGib psaGib
[0:25:30] <@SoFarFetched> GARLE IS MALDING
[0:25:32] <TrashbagZombie> I love when they distinguish between English and American

[0:26:13] <%Ciglossonjr> @PatStaresAt But wait, that's the Elementals
[0:26:23] <%Lewtskie> the music in this trailer was bombin
[0:26:27] <skyheys> @danthelazy kinda yes

[0:37:17] <+genowyn> For them ARR beast tribes
[0:37:17] <$OmegaWeltall> Eurek.... ResidentSleeper
[0:37:23] <%PulverKong> ah k
[0:37:24] <@JustinianKnight> b4 they said they were just lvl scaled up
[0:37:26] <elbigante> relic almost certainly gonna be 500
[0:37:28] <Arnschen> Shiva will be the first one then they cycle it each patch
[0:37:32] <@JustinianKnight> so probably no new mechanics
[0:37:32] <+Rheyr> @PatStaresAt Jokes on you, most my jobs are at level 1, I'm lazy as fuck.
[0:37:34] <+Greywyn00> people do eureka for glams
[0:37:34] <TioXyco> Yeah, Shiva Unreal
[0:37:35] <SolsticeZro> yes it's shiva
[0:37:35] <KoyaMusa> its arr shiva scaled up to 80
[0:37:36] <@JustinianKnight> yea its Shiva
[0:37:37] <aeonicvector> first is shiva afaik
[0:37:38] <%Sausious> it is Shive yeah
[0:37:39] <%Kyoshikei> I woke up late
[0:37:41] <+FactualAdam> My guess is the next thing to stop will be the space bullshit that killed Amaurot in the first place
[0:37:44] <RoxMoxie> Will we be getting proper ilevel drops from Unreal fights, I wonder
[0:37:44] <+Greywyn00> also it makes tons of cash
[0:37:44] <%Daniel_Is_I> Oh god, we're gonna be fighting Titan like a 9th time.
[0:37:45] <+Kurogane_Dread> Relic will be i490 definitely.
[0:37:47] <%Stonebeard> I'm down with Shiva for more Oblivion
[0:37:48] <+ColmBearheart> You wish all my classes are over level 50
[0:37:58] <SolsticeZro> Wonder what that Faux Hollows thing is though
[0:38:04] <+Kurogane_Dread> or i495
[0:38:05] <@JustinianKnight> they'll just be for funsies
[0:38:06] <+Kurogane_Dread> wait
[0:38:09] <ManfredA> Shiva will still be rough
[0:38:11] <+BomaZero> People would still probably fail mog extreme today though
[0:38:12] <GreasyDratini> rogue is still at Lv 0
[0:38:14] <+Kurogane_Dread> that's gonna be the new ex weapon
[0:38:15] <+king_of_beggars> They're make you fight with the old 2.0 era ping.
[0:38:20] <+Kurogane_Dread> so it's definitely going to be i490
[0:38:22] <@JustinianKnight> its a wondrous tales kinda thing
[0:38:28] <ManfredA> Shiva EX is prolly the hardest ARR EX alongside Ramuh
[0:38:30] <+bugz_munny> people will fly into the wall day one
[0:38:30] <skyheys> Why not just incentivize people to min ilvl old content instead?
[0:38:40] <+smevvster> I've already got all my combat classes at 80, maybe I should finally get off my ass and go do my crafters/gatherers before the patch drops
[0:38:42] <%Daniel_Is_I> Rewards? I'M IN
[0:38:45] <KoyaMusa> there are apparently mounts tied to faux hollows but unsure what yet
[0:38:48] <Arnschen> Go in min ilv now and watch people just die all over the place
[0:38:51] <BluBox> Nightmare 2 Kappa
[0:38:55] <%Sausious> @skyheys bc level 50 classes suck when you're used to 80
[0:38:57] <heartlesshealer> oh wow, I didn't think the thing was THIS early. I came on for vods
[0:38:57] <%LunarDensetsu> oh
[0:38:59] <SolsticeZro> Is that so, sounds like YoshiP doesn't know about the Mentor Roulette EX Trial situation LUL
[0:38:59] <RoxMoxie> So, I wonder if there will be Extreme-tier weapon drops from the Unreal fights.
[0:38:59] <heartlesshealer> baby <3
[0:39:01] <bbHighvalor> King mog is gonna be a nightmare again
[0:39:03] <%Kyoshikei> elmo
[0:39:03] <+Greywyn00> nightmarer
[0:39:07] <+ShazBo2000> Jesus it’s fucking 7:20 am go back to sleep
[0:39:09] <+bugz_munny> most players now dont even know she has a thin ice mech
[0:39:09] <RoxMoxie> And for once we'll have a wider variety of weapons to pick from at endgame
[0:39:11] <KoyaMusa> also probably that weird lookin dog
[0:39:14] <Arnschen> SAVE THE QUEEN
[0:39:17] <%bhp_99> baby living his best life
[0:39:26] <aozoranokiseki> Pat is it 4am for you right now?

[0:39:50] <+MakishimaWolf> 7 am for him hes in est
[0:39:54] <+ScrapSentinel> Be a good tank or perish
[0:39:55] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> as long as the aoes aren't colored blue
[0:39:57] <+Hilleltaco> As someone who came in way after it was relevant content, maybe now I'll get to hear Oblivion in-game for longer than like 40 seconds
[0:39:58] <%Daniel_Is_I> It'll just be "Did you point Shiva in the wrong direction? Vuln stack"
[0:39:58] <KoyaMusa> ah everyone's favorite f e a s t

[0:42:54] <%Daniel_Is_I> Oh boy, a title ResidentSleeper
[0:42:57] <+king_of_beggars> They should just let us have a tramp stamp glam, like umbrellas. It takes a mount slot.
[0:42:59] <%michingmallecho> This makes me want to play it and I haven't touched it since shadowbringers. Is this what a crack addiction feels like drhgHmm
[0:42:59] <%sweetlemon5> Finally
[0:43:06] <%Stonebeard> Zenos is the new EX. It means EXTRA THICC
[0:43:06] <$OmegaWeltall> Asses in 14?! Ha! LUL

[0:43:14] <skyheys> @bomazero The slider goes from thick to cake
[0:43:19] <FutaSnek> YES
[0:43:19] <GreasyDratini> FASHION!

[0:43:39] <RubberFistFight> Alright I just popped along to say hi, haven't made it to many of your streams lately Pat. Good to see you're still ticking and that Elmo'
[0:43:39] <+masked_hero_lucky> Give us more glamour dresser space for the love of god
[0:43:41] <%sweetlemon5> NOICE
[0:43:45] <elbigante> the ishgard resto titles better be trash because I don't want to hit top 12 again
[0:43:46] <%PulverKong> Miuna is purdy
[0:44:00] <+masked_hero_lucky> Also give us glamour dressers for houses
[0:44:01] <SolsticeZro> that's some good QoL
[0:44:01] <RubberFistFight> That Elmo's still doing... whatever it is he does. I'm out for the night anyway so I'll catch you whenever I catch you next,.
[0:44:03] <@JustinianKnight> token exchange in cities huh
[0:44:03] <GreasyDratini> When are they anouncing the new smash character?
[0:44:09] <%NWR_James> The Morning Patrick
[0:44:16] <FutaSnek> It's like restarting your PC
[0:44:17] <heartlesshealer> byr RubberFishtFight
[0:44:19] <KoyaMusa> yeah top 12 is gonna be ass, now that people know it's gonna be unique and you can miss out
[0:44:19] <aeonicvector> Second line isnt about specific class afaik, just no doubles for more LB gen
[0:44:19] <$OmegaWeltall> I find the clothing design in this game so bland
[0:44:20] <heartlesshealer> bye*
[0:44:21] <%Daniel_Is_I> G'raha Tia in smash
[0:44:22] <FutaSnek> but with a cat
[0:44:25] <%Stonebeard> yoshi p can we have more glam wardrobe space
[0:44:41] <+alphonseisbest> WoL SMASH WHEN huh P-SAN???
[0:44:42] <FutaSnek> He so smooshed
[0:44:44] <%Shubreaker> Shubreaker subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! grinding out d2 while watching a short king watch announcements 4 a game i don't play yeaaaaaaah
[0:44:45] <%de1ete_forever> the best part of waking up, is Patrick in your cup
[0:44:47] <@JustinianKnight> Glam dressers arent in homes due to a huge bug if more than one person clicks on em
[0:44:49] <%Ciglossonjr> I just want more space in my armory chest
[0:44:51] <DE777ON> u going to watch xboxes event late?

[0:45:08] <+Greywyn00> amazing
[0:45:11] <ManfredA> the servers crash
[0:45:12] <KoyaMusa> oh yeah they crash the game server
[0:45:15] <SolsticeZro> It's just because of that? LUL
[0:45:15] <ManfredA> that huge
[0:45:17] <elbigante> I think the bug is if the dresser is moved if someone else is currently using it
[0:45:19] <+alphonseisbest> LUL
[0:45:22] <%Kyoshikei> that makes sense
[0:45:31] <bbHighvalor> Spaghetti code
[0:45:35] <+bugz_munny> PSO2 this game up man
[0:45:39] <IndoorSitup> did pat just wake up or is he gonne sleepnafter this??
[0:45:39] <%Daniel_Is_I> Tomestones, scrips, beast tribe tokens... what else?
[0:45:40] <@JustinianKnight> yes it also might be because it can be moved etc
[0:45:53] <%Stonebeard> i wish they could fix the spaghetti
[0:45:54] <Arnschen> Cool, yeah it gets annoying having to go to specific areas to empty out your tokens and then go back
[0:45:58] <+bugz_munny> Chuckie cheese tickets
[0:46:06] <+masked_hero_lucky> Then only allow one person to use a dresser at a time, and disable moving it while in use
[0:46:09] <+Bogart4321> he didn't sleep yet
[0:46:10] <@JustinianKnight> Limsa even more packed
[0:46:20] <%Daniel_Is_I> Put a poetic vendor in Eureka please

[0:46:41] <+the22cstomp> @daniel_is_i raid tokens, extreme totems, ultimate totems

[0:46:41] <SolsticeZro> yeah you could just lock the dresser while it's accessed, I mean it's in homes and FC houses, it's a fair workaround
[0:46:41] <%Stonebeard> idyllshire is cancelled

[0:51:37] <%PulverKong> At least he's not stuck between the toilet brush and wall anymore
[0:51:37] <+Crasgnab> @FutaSnek ScaredyCat
[0:51:38] <@JustinianKnight> gpose has a big community
[0:51:39] <%de1ete_forever> an Elmo licked hand is worth two in the bush
[0:51:45] <%Daniel_Is_I> They are spending way more time on this than I thought they would LUL
[0:51:49] <+alphonseisbest> this sum good non content
[0:51:52] <%PulverKong> @EdHeng pat hasn't been up this early in years
[0:51:53] <Leafboi125> You too can become the Sticker Star
[0:51:54] <%EdHeng> is pat sleeping or is he dead?
[0:51:59] <FutaSnek> @Crasgnab Cats got a rough roll in genetics monkaS
[0:52:09] <heartlesshealer> are they stalling for time or something?
[0:52:10] <%NWR_James> @edheng yes

[0:52:23] <ElenaManetta> This IISSS the coooool stuffff!
[0:52:26] <propmaster256> This is my first visit to the stream and Elmo is here and I'm deeply satisfied with the experience thus far.
[0:52:27] <%danthelazy> Go back to the crafting QoL
[0:52:27] <heartlesshealer> what's it called... padding the announcement?
[0:52:28] <%sweetlemon5> feels like I am watching a foreign cooking show
[0:52:29] <+BomaZero> 6 months for stickers doodNuts
[0:52:35] <KoyaMusa> this is like when they spent so long on fellowships that one letter
[0:52:39] <%PulverKong> @EdHeng either he pulled an allnighter or just rolled outta bed for this
[0:52:39] <+NitronStreams> UI TEAM
[0:52:41] <+alphonseisbest> this is neat
[0:52:41] <tactician0> nuuuu this is cool
[0:52:42] <%EdHeng> where do the eggs go?
[0:52:46] <%NWR_James> THIS IS THE COOL
[0:52:48] <%Ciglossonjr> They're desperately trying to finish deleting post-2.o in the background and need to stall for time
[0:52:52] <%PulverKong> BUT STICKERS THO
[0:52:53] <Angry_Ev1L> same lol
[0:52:54] <Nelrum> same
[0:52:54] <skyheys> How many live letters does @patstaresat have to watch before he learns they always focus on the most boring shit?
[0:52:54] <%Metballs> They're furry message boards
[0:52:56] <Arnschen> Fellowships are...ehhhhhhh
[0:52:56] <@JustinianKnight> things no one uses
[0:52:57] <ManfredA> they're forums
[0:52:59] <%Metballs> There are so many furry ones
[0:53:02] <+masked_hero_lucky> Free Companies without any of the benefits of a free company
[0:53:03] <SolsticeZro> they're a failed attempt at bringing discord into the game
[0:53:05] <%de1ete_forever> I feel like im jet lagged in a Japanese coffin hotel
[0:53:09] <%angel949> psaSleep
[0:53:09] <majima666> 12:30pm here in brit land. never seen pat stream this early lol
[0:53:09] <bbHighvalor> Useless
[0:53:11] <%Stonebeard> Fellowships are ERP locators
[0:53:11] <BluBox> It's a featureless message board
[0:53:12] <%bhp_99> they think stickers are cool I guess
[0:53:16] <HardboiledBoi> I thought this was Star Wars Pod Racer
[0:53:20] <Arnschen> So you don't have to alt tab out I guess. But no one uses them, so...
[0:53:21] <FutaSnek> As patti from deadly premonition 2 "I just dont get why people are so obsessed with taking pictures of themselves."
[0:53:26] <+datmegamandeeeee> This is the worst
[0:53:29] <%michingmallecho> Pat, make them stop
[0:53:32] <mikesapartment> good morning daddy
[0:53:33] <%EdHeng> look! you can reposition the date!
[0:53:33] <%Evil_Emu147> Is Paige awake? I could have sworn I heard someone say “Elmo” in the distance on Pat’s side.
[0:53:34] <FutaSnek> As she said*
[0:53:36] <+ScrapSentinel> this is cool stop being shitters
[0:53:42] <+masked_hero_lucky> @bhp_99 Japan loves this kind of thing
[0:53:44] <SolsticeZro> sure Kapp
[0:53:48] <snowmanse> Just re-watched the trailer, it has a vocal version of the Amaurot theme.

[0:54:02] <propmaster256> Photo mode for FFXIV?
[0:54:02] <FutaSnek> I dont find this cool LUL
[0:54:02] <SolsticeZro> we all know YoshiP is working on a budget
[0:54:06] <+Greywyn00> The UI team probably ran out of stuff to do and just worked on this
[0:54:10] <%Ciglossonjr> @snowmanse Thats rad
[0:54:10] <bbHighvalor> TELL THEM TO MAKE AN ASS SLIDER
[0:54:12] <flatcapgame> spend 5 minutes moving that one sticker around
[0:54:15] <%Kyoshikei> @snowmanse what trailer?
[0:54:18] <%miabyte> so glad they're dedicating so much time to STICKERS
[0:54:19] <Jack8274> Legal loli Kreygasm
[0:54:21] <$OmegaWeltall> "Small Indie Dev"
[0:54:21] <KoyaMusa> does pvp even HAVE a team of people at this point
[0:54:22] <fishmonger555> I WANTED MORE UI THEMES THO ;-;
[0:54:22] <%NWR_James> UI team: Chads. Battle team: not
[0:54:26] <$Fortunato5678> Want to see the mech you pilot? How about 30 minutes of photo mode instead?
[0:54:27] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> is this all in japanese
[0:54:29] <JDebss> Is Pat up really early or really late?
[0:54:30] <+facenorway> How long are they gonna fuck around with this shit

[0:54:50] <Jack8274> woolieOMG I WANT BIG GIRL, STEP ON ME woolieOMG
[0:54:53] <heartlesshealer> if you're gonna spend this long on stickers, do it from scratch and have a clear idea what you wanna make from the start to show off how cool the stickers can be, dammit
[0:54:56] <%Stonebeard> @SaltkeyAndAckfish No, "Sticker Mode" is in english
[0:54:56] <%miabyte> omg there's an opacity slider. THIS CHANGES EVERYTHING
[0:54:57] <%Sausious> Hey Pat, have you seen there's a 3DS emulator that works really well, since you'cve said you don't want to pick up your 3DS anymore?
[0:54:58] <%RedKnightVI> Man they're really talking about gpose a lot...
[0:54:58] <+NitronStreams> 90% japanese
[0:54:58] <snowmanse> @Kyoshikei The 5.3 trailer. It's playing during the part where the weapons are fighting around a minute in
[0:54:59] <FutaSnek> I mean it is a new feature so its good to get aquainted with it
[0:54:59] <+tr1ps_ax1om> they are going to focus on this cause they can't show story and stuff i'm guessing
[0:54:59] <ZComiX> Do they have blushes and anime eyes stickers?
[0:55:00] <Arnschen> Oh, you can save sets. That's pretty nice
[0:55:06] <%ammobasket> ooo you can save temps

[0:55:17] <Dral54> The REAL endgame begins now
[0:55:20] <propmaster256> I'm mostly just watching Elmo, he's as good as advertised.
[0:55:22] <+doodoo_tummy> this was worth one less dungeon per patch
[0:55:23] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> how long has this been going?
[0:55:25] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> @Stonebeard ah i thought my brocas' area was acting up
[0:55:28] <+PlayingChello> so paige is gonna start playing right
[0:55:28] <BluBox> ela3 ela4
[0:55:32] <KoyaMusa> why must they spend so long on these points
[0:55:33] <+smevvster> They've gone over countless times why they don't want a built in parser
[0:55:36] <+datmegamandeeeee> STICKER MODE
[0:55:38] <RoxMoxie> Fascinating
[0:55:39] <%Kyoshikei> @snowmanse thanks, will watch on tablet

[0:55:52] <%ScottishMadJacko> does anyone actually care about this sort of stuff?
[0:55:53] <Animorphimagi> Ok
[0:55:53] <%Daniel_Is_I> Pat is slowly being drained

[1:00:49] <%Ciglossonjr> Can we get a Yorha version of that?
[1:00:49] <tattleworm> it's the nier mecha
[1:00:50] <+TheBrokenTwigs> nier?
[1:00:51] <%SomeSageAdvice> that has to be from the new alliance raid
[1:00:52] <TioXyco> it's not
[1:00:53] <%RedKnightVI> automata flight unit
[1:00:53] <+alphonseisbest> NIER
[1:00:53] <heartlesshealer> Oh
[1:00:55] <ZComiX> What does that look like for a normal sized character
[1:00:55] <aeonicvector> nier? but that dosent seem like a flight suit?
[1:00:55] <%michingmallecho> YES
[1:00:56] <tactician0> I get on the bot PogChamp
[1:00:57] <VicWright> Probably Nier raid
[1:00:57] <DE777ON> is that jetscream
[1:00:58] <+NoirXTX> Flight in base zones is still such a weird thing to me
[1:01:00] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> neir
[1:01:01] <%MegboyManuel> Its probably from the Nioer Raid
[1:01:03] <The_Shiznet> i want to see him fly across bronze lake
[1:01:03] <+aWanderingKaivo> I'd say nier
[1:01:04] <TioXyco> Ho229 is different
[1:01:04] <+Greywyn00> it's a NieR flight Unit
[1:01:05] <+Hilleltaco> It's kinda like a flight unit, but doesn't quite look like one?
[1:01:05] <Angry_Ev1L> that's DOPE
[1:01:07] <%Ciglossonjr> That doesnt look very Nier
[1:01:08] <+Steezem> looks too bulky for nier
[1:01:08] <%michingmallecho> Lets go MACROSS BAYBAY
[1:01:11] <+facenorway> Looks evel less like Garlean
[1:01:11] <SolsticeZro> but Alliance Raids don't drop mounts
[1:01:11] <DE777ON> decepticons
[1:01:13] <heartlesshealer> definitely not yorha like
[1:01:14] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> It came from my dreams apparently Shit looks awesome
[1:01:14] <+doodoo_tummy> that looks like 9S's flight unit
[1:01:14] <%NWR_James> !motivated
[1:01:14] <+LiveStreamOnyx> doodRage doodRage doodRage
[1:01:14] <maebold> yeah that doesn't really look like the nier flight units
[1:01:16] <olaksi> Nier's gotta be the flight unit right?
[1:01:17] <Jack8274> F.A.T.E.
[1:01:18] <+BomaZero> could be MSQ
[1:01:20] <+aWanderingKaivo> its offbrand nier
[1:01:20] <+lucaflowe> It looks like a neir thing
[1:01:23] <%Fidranth> It's a dwarven copy
[1:01:24] <+Quaraezha> Dwarves Mount
[1:01:25] <%Ciglossonjr> I think there will be a nier one which will share the animation
[1:01:26] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> double Zeta?
[1:01:26] <RushUnplugged> guys it looks nothing like the Nier flight units
[1:01:26] <tactician0> @patstaresat its from Type zero
[1:01:29] <LittleBigQuebec> waht if it's dwarf built based on Yphra design @PatStaresAt
[1:01:29] <TioXyco> I'd say that the Dwarf mount, based on the NieR mount
[1:01:30] <+Rheyr> Isn't it the mech plans from Nier?
[1:01:31] <FutaSnek> Neir stuff looks way more refined
[1:01:32] <+alphonseisbest> Could be both
[1:01:33] <+PlaneWalkerDavid> Dwarf designed based on the Flight Units?
[1:01:36] <%de1ete_forever> insomnia go brrr
[1:01:36] <+NoirXTX> Dosn't look garlean at all

[1:01:41] <snowmanse> @SolsticeZro They didn't drop glamour coffers either until the last raid.
[1:01:42] <%michingmallecho> doesn't look like anything to me
[1:01:45] <+eiightbiitt> @patstaresat have you seen the skyscraper sized functional Gundam they are building in japan?
[1:01:47] <rosemon5001> upgrade to the yorha one?
[1:01:49] <%Daniel_Is_I> Oh if it's the dwarf mount then awesome
[1:01:50] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> cids plane
[1:01:55] <CitrusDrink> That rotating jump transformation thing looked very Nier but it's not a regular Yorha flight unit so who knows
[1:01:57] <%angel949> just flip the switch and do it lol
[1:01:58] <+genowyn> I hope you can fly across the split zones in la noscea

[1:04:55] <+NitronStreams> T pose to assert aerial superiority
[1:04:59] <The_Shiznet> that's so weird
[1:05:02] <olaksi> Yeah, they had to do a ton of new rendering to make this work
[1:05:07] <+Greywyn00> that's actually a lot of work to do
[1:05:08] <heartlesshealer> hmm
[1:05:08] <%danthelazy> Wait can we actually go to outside the gold saucer?
[1:05:10] <Arnschen> Nice

[1:05:27] <heartlesshealer> will they add enemies to the rooftops????
[1:05:28] <%Daniel_Is_I> No aether currents
[1:05:32] <Arnschen> Yeah, that must have been a shit ton of work doing
[1:05:32] <+LiveStreamOnyx> Fly Return to the Waking Sands
[1:05:35] <+Hilleltaco> It's kinda surreal seeing this happen, and I haven't even been playing all that long, relatively
[1:05:36] <%Kyoshikei> will there be new sight seeing?
[1:05:37] <FutaSnek> Well at least people have new erp spots Kappa
[1:05:37] <$OmegaWeltall> "Pray FLY to the Wakeing Sands"

[1:05:43] <maebold> pray fly your ass to the waking sands
[1:05:43] <%Stonebeard> "Pray, fly your ass to the Waking sands"
[1:05:46] <fuji_92> fly to the loading zone plz Kappa
[1:05:52] <+smevvster> This would have actually required a significant amount of work - honestly surprised it's patch content and not expansion content
[1:06:13] <+king_of_beggars> Go to the floating Nym Islands, you bastard.
[1:06:22] <+Shikari21> I hate its idle pose
[1:06:24] <$ah_clif> hey! you're on when I'm awake! How about that, a rare sight indeed to see you when I live in China
[1:06:32] <%PulverKong> isn't this amazing content
[1:06:34] <Who_lio42> @Greywyn00 oohh got it. thanks
[1:06:35] <heartlesshealer> people with flying mounts can clog up less of the road at least? Is that part of why they let you just fly over everything?
[1:06:35] <%SomeSageAdvice> they've been working on it for awhile, so thats why its out now and not in an expansion @smevvster
[1:06:39] <%DensityD> hug pose
[1:06:41] <skyheys> @smevvster It was in the works for a long ass time and is basically delayed expansion content

[1:09:40] <%VHGS> There's also the part before garuda where you go to get the crystal but OOPS it's the wrong one (like four times)
[1:09:42] <snowmanse> @Afterman_ We didn't have to save him, we had to kill flies so the sound wouldn't keep him up at night.
[1:09:44] <%PulverKong> japanese men don't age until they turn 80, then they prune up super fast
[1:09:46] <%DensityD> he kissed the baby
[1:09:47] <+alphonseisbest> Titan almost made me QUIT
[1:09:48] <+Shuazing> Yeah they’ll prob still make you do brayflox normal for the cheese
[1:09:49] <%Daniel_Is_I> "Hey fight Titan three times" "Why?" "Because we said so"
[1:09:50] <%Ciglossonjr> No fucking way they're removing the titan banquet, they reference that shit
[1:09:51] <+smevvster> "The long fetch quests are shortened You don't have to fetch something 3 times now, only 1 time"
[1:09:54] <+Hilleltaco> Good ol' Titan feast. Such a fun time that the game makes fun of it later

[1:12:48] <SolsticeZro> I thought it's Crystal that always gets memed on
[1:12:48] <%MegboyManuel> and Ultros
[1:12:56] <+Greywyn00> GOOD HOLY FUCK
[1:12:56] <heartlesshealer> hmmm
[1:13:01] <%PulverKong> These two clearly sit next to eachother in an open office landscape
[1:13:02] <RushUnplugged> "why are the people that write lore, saying thing against lore"
[1:13:02] <%MegboyManuel> okay im in Ultros AND Aether, but fuck u >:O
[1:13:07] <%TakingLifesL> anyone else hear that boo?
[1:13:08] <+facenorway> Wasn't Stormblood bad in that regard?
[1:13:11] <%de1ete_forever> 6 more minutes and i have to gothefucktosleep
[1:13:13] <GrandmasterBFunk> as someone who had a friend recently go through 2.x, this is great
[1:13:13] <%MegboyManuel> skreee
[1:13:15] <$Afterman_> Is now a good time to get back in? last thing I did was beat Hades.
[1:13:18] <%Stonebeard> My first character was on Ultros
[1:13:18] <ManfredA> presumably it's for the 4 levels at the end of ARR
[1:13:22] <olaksi> I don't think I ever needed to really grind unless I was playing multiple jobs at once?
[1:13:23] <+Greywyn00> I was helping a friend though 2.0 and those level gates SUCK
[1:13:26] <$OmegaWeltall> honestly that was the reason i never got an alt past lv 10, shit got boring 2nd time around
[1:13:28] <%SomeSageAdvice> @propmaster256 the new experience is slightly intimidating but most stuff converts fairly well and a lot of quality of life swings in at you hard
[1:13:29] <+alphonseisbest> I love how much these are bros
[1:13:33] <%Stonebeard> His name is Don Miqo'te
[1:13:42] <+alphonseisbest> like these guys are bros

[1:22:27] <%michingmallecho> 😧
[1:22:29] <+Neoripo> YES!!
[1:22:35] <+doodoo_tummy> Monk's combo consumes a greased lightning charge now, all greased lightning chages are now gained by Anatman
[1:22:37] <VongolaGearX> I think monks fun but greased lighting sucks
[1:22:37] <%michingmallecho> DO IT COWARDS
[1:22:38] <%Daniel_Is_I> LUL
[1:22:38] <Who_lio42> lmaoo
[1:22:44] <AsiSed> Enjoying Monk, big damage.
[1:22:46] <heartlesshealer> I hope SCH is still fun dots management
[1:22:48] <vonmaultke> """"Something""" LUL
[1:22:49] <elbigante> learn a new rotation in time for new raid
[1:22:49] <+Neoripo> Extend grease
[1:22:49] <%Stonebeard> They're gonna do SOMETHING
[1:22:49] <+gannondaddy> just delete monk
[1:22:49] <@SSaryn> Just give them Nero's Demon Arm fuck it
[1:22:50] <+smevvster> Ah yes I'm sure Pat the biggest Monk Main has the biggest stake in the job
[1:22:52] <DirtyMiser> TK for MNK still useless
[1:22:53] <+king_of_beggars> In FFXI Greased Lightning's equivalent was a trait called Martial Arts that made you faster at the cost of TP gain.
[1:23:00] <tactician0> do thing now
[1:23:06] <%michingmallecho> ***something***
[1:23:14] <yukin0tora> Why can I hear Ramuh music
[1:23:14] <%Daniel_Is_I> "This is fine"
[1:23:18] <+Cuon_Alpinus> holy shit that free trial expansion
[1:23:19] <amritadyne> tk spam is back yeesss
[1:23:22] <Arnschen> If it doesn't beat SAM it should be good
[1:23:23] <AsiSed> Tornado Kick and SSS should just be removed.
[1:23:30] <+Greetings_Gentlemen> Also Greased Lightning is a dumb name
[1:23:33] <%Fidranth> Let us suplex the damn train
[1:23:41] <MrNoremac208> @patstaresat the class quest for monk is fun
[1:23:41] <olaksi> Just make the downtime combo finisher a backstep?
[1:23:51] <heartlesshealer> hmm
[1:23:52] <+Neoripo> DOUBT
[1:23:53] <Jontman42> Pat doesn't know japanese is he lying to us
[1:23:54] <%VHGS> how much easier can it possibly be?
[1:23:56] <ManfredA> That is
[1:23:56] <+alphonseisbest> @PatStaresAt have u checked out PSO2 yet? sorry 4 being off topic
[1:23:59] <ManfredA> NOT
[1:24:00] <SolsticeZro> that should apply to every job then
[1:24:00] <KoyaMusa> monk already has 2 skills that do that?
[1:24:00] <%DensityD> LUL MMO nerds slinging their MMO jargon around, I enjoy viewing this from the outside
[1:24:02] <ManfredA> what MNK needs
[1:24:03] <%Daniel_Is_I> Good, they let DRG have 100% Blood uptime
[1:24:07] <%Lewtskie> JUST GET RID OF STACKS
[1:24:08] <%Daniel_Is_I> No reason Monk should lose stacks
[1:24:08] <@SSaryn> I assume using switching between stances or charging Chakra will do it?
[1:24:10] <+doodoo_tummy> Anatman with no cooldown
[1:24:10] <Arnschen> Give MNKs the ability to fly off the stage like everyone else
[1:24:14] <Jack8274> GOOD!
[1:24:18] <Busterinabox> Hey, wandered in from my suggestions, are you translating on the fly or?
[1:24:18] <heartlesshealer> oh!
[1:24:19] <elbigante> BARD BUFFS
[1:24:22] <Arnschen> Like MCH, nice
[1:24:24] <%Dwarven_Gaming> GOOD
[1:24:27] <TioXyco> they're deleting monk to add monk
[1:24:28] <SolsticeZro> kind of expected that after this raid tier
[1:24:28] <%RedKnightVI> yey
[1:24:30] <%Toynota10> @alphonseisbest he tried but the Microsoft store shot made him not wanna play
[1:24:32] <%Ciglossonjr> YES
[1:24:35] <%zestyArsenic> maybe they wont have a positional every god damn skill
[1:24:38] <%DensityD> invent new class, called "Mank"
[1:24:38] <$OmegaWeltall> yea Pat try PSO2, just use the Tweaker to subvert Windows Store
[1:24:40] <skyheys> Fuck Monk
[1:24:42] <olaksi> Bard should actually be Bard
[1:24:42] <heartlesshealer> Delete MNK to add PUG???
[1:24:43] <+Neoripo> GOOD
[1:24:44] <OkamiDude15> Monk will now play like a guilty gear character
[1:24:44] <+Greywyn00> getting the machinist makeover
[1:24:46] <%VHGS> Monk...2!
[1:24:46] <+doodoo_tummy> Bards get fucked, worst class

[1:25:00] <%radda343> YES
[1:25:00] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> Just add the monk from diablo 2
[1:25:01] <+Hilleltaco> I think Monk is kinda fun but it kinda makes my brain go smooth
[1:25:03] <fuji_92> MONK IS DEAD, LONG LIVE MONK
[1:25:05] <@SSaryn> BRD and AST were the big asks so thank god.
[1:25:06] <+NoirXTX> ast needs more diverse cards back
[1:25:10] <$OmegaWeltall> yea i did like old AST better
[1:25:13] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> I understand nothing but like everything

[1:25:14] <%Ciglossonjr> Please buff SCH
[1:25:15] <%Sausious> that's fine for bard
[1:25:16] <olaksi> Make Ranger a separate job please
[1:25:17] <%Ciglossonjr> Please
[1:25:19] <elbigante> bard suicide rate down to 0%
[1:25:19] <+Onikieran> Wonder if DRK is getting any changes. I feel pretty happy with DRK at the mo.
[1:25:19] <@JustinianKnight> brd still gunna be bad to play tho
[1:25:19] <%Daniel_Is_I> BRD isn't in a bad place mechanically, it just needs more damage
[1:25:23] <Who_lio42> delet MNK for MONK
[1:25:25] <OkamiDude15> Bard now deal negative damage and are delegates to heal and support
[1:25:26] <skyheys> Give its cards back you fuckers
[1:25:26] <SolsticeZro> me too, SB AST was amazing
[1:25:29] <%MarylandJutsu> @ssaryn agreed AST needed boosts
[1:25:31] <@SSaryn> BRD will indeed be still bad to play
[1:25:38] <%Daniel_Is_I> DRK just needs Living Dead buffs
[1:25:39] <Busterinabox> Yeah I miss old AST cards. All dps is boring. ;v
[1:25:45] <ManfredA> I disagree
[1:25:47] <+lucaflowe> MCH damage buff tho?
[1:25:49] <@SSaryn> DNC and MCH I think will still be the Ranged we see the most.
[1:25:50] <ManfredA> some were rough
[1:25:50] <RoxMoxie> Make WAR less fucking stupid pls.
[1:25:52] <ManfredA> NO
[1:25:55] <ManfredA> fuck current DRK
[1:25:56] <$OmegaWeltall> new AST is FINE.... BUT i liked old AST better
[1:25:56] <+Yakobro> "ast is already the best healer, let's buff it"
[1:26:04] <elbigante> LD needs a convalescence tacked on
[1:26:07] <+MephioTV> at least it isn't Superbolide
[1:26:08] <Skelegon> Make Flamethrower actually useful
[1:26:10] <ManfredA> DRK right now is just edgy WAR
[1:26:12] <+facenorway> even 90% would be good
[1:26:13] <DirtyMiser> Rework AST again
[1:26:14] <+smevvster> How about just a big x00% healing buff when Living Dead is active.
[1:26:16] <RoxMoxie> I hate that Warrior just keeps getting less and less complex to the point of just being 1 button.
[1:26:18] <@JustinianKnight> Superbolide is amazing tho
[1:26:18] <@SSaryn> OH NO SMN CHANGES
[1:26:24] <%Daniel_Is_I> SMN NERFS
[1:26:26] <olaksi> DRK is great
[1:26:26] <Forester_Skippy> i love fights where they go just invuln the buster and then still die
[1:26:26] <%Daniel_Is_I> LUL
[1:26:26] <+Greywyn00> make it last a bit longer?
[1:26:27] <AsiSed> I'm fine with current Monk, but Bard definitely needs buffing
[1:26:28] <heartlesshealer> !
[1:26:29] <skyheys> 75%
[1:26:30] <alcett> SB DRK was way more fun, SHB DRK is so slow
[1:26:32] <+Greywyn00> NO STOp
[1:26:33] <+MephioTV> NOOOO
[1:26:34] <Arnschen> NOOOOOOOOO
[1:26:34] <aeonicvector> fair

[1:26:35] <+king_of_beggars> At least make heals crit until you're back up to 100%
[1:26:37] <x02DannyBoy> I pray for the day sch (or even all healers) get a second dot
[1:26:38] <+Greywyn00> DON'T NERF SMN

[1:26:47] <OkamiDude15> SMN is currently being deleted and replaced
[1:26:48] <+smevvster> Dark Arts was the WORST

[1:27:53] <@SSaryn> MNK bad
[1:27:55] <ManfredA> haha funny dark arts, ignoring that tanks are all different flavors of WAR now except GNB
[1:27:56] <SolsticeZro> show bosses
[1:27:56] <+toadlyy> Can they make WAR more than IR-Fell Cleave pls
[1:27:58] <+Neoripo> Bunker DOWN!
[1:28:07] <%Dwarven_Gaming> ha ha
[1:28:08] <OkamiDude15> @dwarven_gaming total rework apparently
[1:28:08] <@SSaryn> And yeah NIN after the patch has brought NIN to I believe almost perfect.
[1:28:11] <heartlesshealer> MNK remains same until Reborn
[1:28:12] <%Dwarven_Gaming> :P
[1:28:20] <@SSaryn> Everything else about NIN I can say is just a nitpick
[1:28:20] <%Dwarven_Gaming> well the major rework is 5.4
[1:28:25] <%Dwarven_Gaming> so what is 5.3 getting?
[1:28:31] <%Ciglossonjr> Is FFXIV a prequel to Nier ReIncarnation?
[1:28:38] <@JustinianKnight> make Assassinate not janky
[1:28:38] <%ScrotesMuhGoats> ScrotesMuhGoats subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 18 months! 
[1:28:39] <Arnschen> NIN is alot of fun at 80
[1:28:39] <@JustinianKnight> thats all
[1:28:41] <RogueMinja> how did bunker crash if it blew up?
[1:28:41] <@SSaryn> They either didn't actually say or they're getting actually nothing
[1:28:42] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> when PSO2 cross over happening, still waiting
[1:28:44] <%Dwarven_Gaming> stormblood
[1:28:44] <+ConLin_Arts_> I like Monk
[1:28:45] <%Sausious> always
[1:28:46] <%Dwarven_Gaming> ruined it
[1:28:47] <@SSaryn> Yeah Assassinate is the big one
[1:28:47] <KoyaMusa> except 4.2 monk
[1:28:47] <skyheys> @ssaryn I hated putting mudra on cooldown at first but it's really fun anyway
[1:28:48] <%Daniel_Is_I> Meanwhile DRG has been good since ARR
[1:28:50] <%Lewtskie> I miss HW MNK
[1:28:52] <@SSaryn> The animation lock is fucking god awful
[1:28:56] <%Lewtskie> HW was peak for MNK
[1:28:56] <%Daniel_Is_I> Lesson: always play DRG
[1:28:57] <%Dwarven_Gaming> 4.2 MONK
[1:28:59] <elbigante> Monk was fun in HW but the exact opposite of the meta
[1:28:59] <%Dwarven_Gaming> double TK
[1:28:59] <BluBox> Jank job
[1:29:00] <@JustinianKnight> it looks weird
[1:29:01] <%Mendin> @Ciglossonjr Do not joke about Taroverse canon because he damn well might
[1:29:01] <%Dwarven_Gaming> was SO fun
[1:29:03] <BallerSwagBro9k> @PatStaresAt How's Samurai?
[1:29:04] <KoyaMusa> tornado kick monk was so good
[1:29:06] <OkamiDude15> Ffxiv takes place 3 thousand years after automata lytSMUG
[1:29:06] <@JustinianKnight> and pulls aoe markers with it
[1:29:09] <Arnschen> Oh yeah, that animation lock
[1:29:10] <+BomaZero> monk had ups and downs all throughout time
[1:29:13] <%danthelazy> Remember when Monk was supposed to be the SB poster boy?
[1:29:13] <fuji_92> do I need to play ff 1 to 14 to understand no
[1:29:17] <@SSaryn> SAM is also pretty perfect where it is now
[1:29:18] <BallerSwagBro9k> YUS
[1:29:19] <ManfredA> SAM's fun now
[1:29:21] <ManfredA> wasn't in 5.0
[1:29:23] <Arnschen> YEAHH
[1:29:24] <SolsticeZro> yeah SAM is really smooth
[1:29:25] <heartlesshealer> more potato
[1:29:28] <@SSaryn> Like, people still meme it but it's still one of the top DPS right now.
[1:29:28] <+masked_hero_lucky> Yes
[1:29:28] <+smevvster> PogChamp
[1:29:28] <@JustinianKnight> SAM is very good
[1:29:28] <+FactualAdam> Since they fixed the level 80 skill, SAM got real good
[1:29:29] <+bugz_munny> it does BIG DAMAGE
[1:29:30] <$Afterman_> Sam is a fun button presser
[1:29:31] <Joustar_> NotLikeThis
[1:29:32] <BallerSwagBro9k> IMMA GO FULL YOJIMBO
[1:29:33] <+bugz_munny> and does it well
[1:29:34] <k7991> SAM seems fun but leveling it sucks
[1:29:35] <flatcapgame> I want more dragoon jumps

[1:30:08] <%Daniel_Is_I> I still don't know if this is canon to the Nier story or not
[1:30:09] <+NitronStreams> *Weight of the World intensifies*
[1:30:09] <GrandmasterBFunk> The raids will 100% be canon in the DrakeNier universe
[1:30:09] <+Rose_Silvers> this looks more star wars then nier
[1:30:12] <%Mendin> Wait, it's in the desert.

[1:53:17] <%DensityD> briittFawk briittArgh psaGib
[1:53:20] <%Pompadourius> It's enough to where people won't care about saying things in this stream in particular I'd say.
[1:53:29] <$OmegaWeltall> i figured that was just how they made trailers in japan
[1:53:32] <+masked_hero_lucky> Also chat/Pat will likely talk about spoilers
[1:53:39] <SolsticeZro> monkaS Exdeath music
[1:53:41] <x02DannyBoy> Neo-Exdeath SourPls
[1:53:42] <clumsydemiurge> spoilers: such devastation was not Gaius's intention
[1:53:44] <%Pompadourius> Being here generally assumes either you are caught up or don't care about spoilers I'd say?
[1:53:45] <Lord_maxios> what you think of the live letter so far senior Patric?
[1:53:46] <%Stonebeard> 90% of the trailers have spoilers that are ruses
[1:53:51] <+king_of_beggars> Anticipation of new content is part of concurrent experience.
[1:54:00] <ManfredA> long story short
[1:54:02] <%DensityD> get bamboozled
[1:54:07] <ManfredA> don't watch trailers until you're at that patch
[1:54:12] <Mawarup> I have been out since the end of 5.0 how bad is it for me to be here?
[1:54:14] <%Pompadourius> ^
[1:54:21] <ManfredA> very
[1:54:25] <%Ciglossonjr> Nobody's ever really gone
[1:54:34] <Arnschen> Yeah, they'll link dialogue to completely different scenes and content so the trailers will be fake outs at times
[1:54:38] <maebold> run mawarup
[1:54:38] <+king_of_beggars> It's like being a sports team fan. Getting hype with other players for new shit is a part of your experience as an MMO player.
[1:54:40] <clumsydemiurge> It's super sad that a big chunk of players got spoiled on the Amarout reveal from the loading screen
[1:54:44] <%Pompadourius> I give more of a shit about FFXIV's story than most games out there nowadays LUL
[1:54:45] <+SergeEXE> Did they fuck with DRK?
[1:54:54] <Neo_Kaiser> Some people take spoilers too seriously.
[1:54:55] <%senorpapel> gotchya, i figured open letter would just be like class changes etc. so thought was spoiler safe
[1:54:57] <+alphonseisbest> Pat u gonna get paige to give 14 a go now?
[1:55:03] <ShoMibu> guild wars 2
[1:55:08] <RoxMoxie> Man, I regret never seeing Neo-Exdeath for myself.
[1:55:14] <restingbones> oh so this is only gonna be FF14 related?
[1:55:30] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> I donta care that much about the story. just give me something to play
[1:55:42] <flatcapgame> dont tell me the results of last night's football match
[1:55:42] <%psydaku> Is that the Black Mages version of the Neo Exdeath playing in the background?
[1:55:52] <%MegboyManuel> just deal with it basically, you cant force people to stop
[1:55:56] <SolsticeZro> monkaS Hades music
[1:55:57] <restingbones> Hope all yall who care about FF14 get some cool news and the things oyu want, byebyee
[1:56:01] <+Templar15> >implying wrestlemania is cool
[1:56:02] <+ConLin_Arts_> Kreygasm Invincible
[1:56:04] <KoyaMusa> yeah cause for up to date people we've known this stuff for actual months to years
[1:56:06] <olaksi> People are not going to wait for a year for you to catch up, yeah
[1:56:14] <TioXyco> 4.3
[1:56:14] <%PulverKong> @alphonseisbest are you insane? paige can't even focus on something for 15 minutes
[1:56:15] <%Pompadourius> It falls into that same weird space as Tiger King where, like... people are going to talk about "spoilers" all over the place no matter what in a way that you wouldn't see with a single player game or a normal fictional story.
[1:56:18] <clumsydemiurge> Bah gawd, as God as my witness, Zodiark is broken in 14
[1:56:31] <%MegboyManuel> people hop into group VC's all the time expecting not to be spoiled during patch drop and its annoying
[1:56:33] <Cubblesv2> LUL LUL LUL
[1:56:35] <elbigante> LMAO
[1:56:38] <+doodoo_tummy> I spoiled myself on tsukuyomi by seeing her face on the musicc video

[1:56:55] <%Pompadourius> OH MY GOD
[1:57:01] <+lucaflowe> LMAO THAT TITLE
[1:57:01] <elbigante> and it was like a callback to another character death
[1:57:04] <@JustinianKnight> less than a week
[1:57:04] <%senorpapel> lol, walking spoiler title
[1:57:06] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> I love that title
[1:57:06] <%Pompadourius> WOWWWWWWW THAT IS SO BAD
[1:57:07] <+ConLin_Arts_> LUL
[1:57:09] <%Pompadourius> LMAO
[1:57:09] <+king_of_beggars> Descriptions of minions is the worst spoiler minefield.
[1:57:18] <+masked_hero_lucky> Does this character's name start with a P?
[1:57:24] <StryfeDragon> What'd they change it to?
[1:57:29] <+Yakobro> yers
[1:57:29] <clumsydemiurge> Title: _______ DIES IN MAGMA
[1:57:29] <+doodoo_tummy> i dont remember who even dies there
[1:57:30] <+lucaflowe> it does
[1:57:30] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> yes
[1:57:31] <%Pompadourius> I like their naming conventions now where they keep patches vague.
[1:57:35] <@JustinianKnight> the Final Witness
[1:57:35] <+Yakobro> finest student @PatStaresAt
[1:57:38] <%Sausious> The Final Witness
[1:57:40] <snowmanse> "The Finest Student's Witness"
[1:57:41] <%Sausious> just removed the name
[1:57:42] <ManfredA> His Finest Student
[1:57:43] <+MephioTV> "The Last Witness" I think
[1:57:44] <ManfredA> or something
[1:57:45] <%tom_glasses91> @PatStaresAt Fine's Pupil's Ally
[1:57:45] <%Pompadourius> Like "Reflections in Crystal" isn't saying anything
[1:57:46] <xXFlyingBrickXx> I mean that sounds like a dope title, but cmon KEKW
[1:57:49] <%senorpapel> btw, hot take. i think heavensward was better story thant stormblood so far
[1:57:51] <%Pompadourius> Until you beat it
[1:57:52] <+lucaflowe> Finest Student
[1:57:54] <%senorpapel> but only halfway through
[1:57:57] <%Ciglossonjr> To be fair, that's a rad title but yeah thats fucked
[1:57:59] <+doodoo_tummy> oh yeaah, thought you were talking about 4.56
[1:58:00] <elbigante> "The Finest Pupil's Ally"
[1:58:05] <clumsydemiurge> @senorpapel that's not remotely a hot take
[1:58:06] <GrandmasterBFunk> there's a minion of a character with their true name and design you get from the Eden raids
[1:58:07] <%Pompadourius> Hades <3
[1:58:09] <k7991> @senorpapel Thats not a hot take, most people think HW was stronger i think
[1:58:16] <ManfredA> HW's story is overhyped in some regards
[1:58:22] <ManfredA> it's definitely better but it has low points
[1:58:26] <+smevvster> Wait, wasn't Final Witness for finishing Coil?
[1:58:26] <+doodoo_tummy> yeaaah Byakko, took me 99 fucking tokens
[1:58:29] <%Pompadourius> Shadowbringers > Heavensward > Stormblood > ARR imo

[2:01:04] <ManfredA> that's the lore of the name
[2:01:10] <$Fortunato5678> No more memory space in Kholusia, apparently
[2:01:20] <Wak033> Ayo fuck Lalafell players

[2:02:03] <%Pompadourius> OH MY GOD THAT MOUNT
[2:02:05] <BallerSwagBro9k> Pokemon Music?
[2:02:08] <+PlaneWalkerDavid> Instanced obviously
[2:02:09] <Cubblesv2> yo is that mount a ghetto flight unit?!
[2:02:10] <%Ciglossonjr> probably like what happens in Rhalgers
[2:02:10] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> Seriously that's just Cid's Bronco plane right
[2:02:11] <+ConLin_Arts_> cute
[2:02:12] <%Pompadourius> Bootleg flight unit :O
[2:02:15] <Marsaline> Do you think the mech mount might be the mount tied to the Dwarves beast tribe stuff?
[2:02:16] <+doodoo_tummy> ahhh those 2 dwarf twin copied 9S's flight unit
[2:02:16] <Ceeki> THAT MOUNT! holy shit
[2:02:19] <+king_of_beggars> Will the dwarves in Rak'tika greet you with a LAHEEEEEE-ho?
[2:02:22] <TioXyco> I think so too, pat
[2:02:23] <yukin0tora> TANK
[2:02:30] <$vincerocmm> v3/y ncft3/bal
[2:02:30] <+Hilleltaco> Yeah that'd make sense
[2:02:31] <+Greywyn00> I agree
[2:02:32] <JulianLynx> It pirouettes!
[2:02:34] <+doodoo_tummy> yeah the twins copied it
[2:02:35] <clumsydemiurge> dude whoever said pokemon town music was on point
[2:02:36] <+NitronStreams> cool
[2:02:36] <Cubblesv2> GIB MOUNT PLX
[2:02:39] <Badpest> bobberWow I want that
[2:02:40] <+alphonseisbest> might be yaeh
[2:02:41] <+masked_hero_lucky> I'll be so happy if this is the Dwarf tribe mount
[2:02:42] <fishmonger555> not enougth gaudy green metal
[2:02:42] <KoyaMusa> oh this remix
[2:02:52] <The_Shiznet> why don't they put beast tribe themes on beast tribe mounts :(
[2:02:52] <ManfredA> it'll be bigger
[2:02:53] <%Pompadourius> Scale up the mount obvs
[2:02:53] <+masked_hero_lucky> It'll be huge
[2:02:54] <%Daniel_Is_I> It'll just be BIG
[2:02:55] <%LaughingCatt> itll get bigger
[2:02:57] <SolsticeZro> i don't know it looks really advanced for a tribe that has such shitty weapons and armor
[2:02:57] <%Metballs> Bigger one
[2:02:57] <tubit> awkwardly?
[2:02:58] <+smevvster> It's gonna upscale to hell and back
[2:03:00] <TheSkeep> very carefully
[2:03:01] <%tom_glasses91> It's gonna be fuckhuge
[2:03:01] <%miguelrod777> bigger
[2:03:01] <TioXyco> probably will scale to size
[2:03:01] <JulianLynx> With difficulty.
[2:03:02] <+Shikari21> HUGE
[2:03:05] <%AnIcedCoffee> itll be like the robot frog mount, dont worry about it
[2:03:06] <+yuuxRemi> its a flight unit from agito
[2:03:07] <%Fidranth> roe will stand on wings in a kamina pose
[2:03:09] <+SergeEXE> It's not a Tribe Quest for Pat, for he is a part of their tribe
[2:03:11] <+cinder_chan> does he really play with his meter in the center of the screen like that?
[2:03:11] <+king_of_beggars> They ride the frog don't they?
[2:03:13] <+Neoripo> Back in my day we had to TP to horizont and walk to the waking sands TWICE!
[2:03:19] <maebold> a very tenuous grasp on one of the wings
[2:03:22] <+doodoo_tummy> Imagine if roes just stood ontop kamina-style, god
[2:03:24] <ManfredA> Dwarves have robots dude
[2:03:31] <+NitronStreams> does it come in size XXXL
[2:03:32] <ManfredA> they're not backwoods tribes
[2:03:33] <flatcapgame> this sounds like gen 1 pokemon music
[2:03:37] <%Sausious> all mine are 80 so
[2:03:38] <%Pompadourius> Leveling crafters? Just use firmament :P
[2:03:39] <+Greywyn00> so a beast tribe?
[2:03:46] <+cinder_chan> are dwarves new to 14?
[2:03:46] <aeonicvector> @Neoripo Limsa, Arcanist, boat, its CONFIRMED faster
[2:03:50] <%Daniel_Is_I> I wonder if we'll have choices like the Qitari one
[2:03:53] <clumsydemiurge> the virgin horizon TP vs the chad limsa ferry
[2:04:00] <+masked_hero_lucky> Robots for Eorzea!
[2:04:01] <CSeriesJTYPE> why is nothing happening
[2:04:01] <%Pompadourius> Oh noooo
[2:04:16] <%Pompadourius> BRING YORHA TO GARLEMALD
[2:04:18] <%terminallyCapriciousz> Just roll up with TANKS
[2:04:20] <+Neoripo> I know, just joking
[2:04:25] <olaksi> They already have spider laser tanks though
[2:04:27] <+TombstoneTTromboners> "what the shit is that" as a robo frogs rolls up
[2:04:28] <TioXyco> ACTUAL stroke on stream
[2:04:28] <SolsticeZro> LUL hang in there we are not done yet
[2:04:29] <fishmonger555> wait so who's actually in charge of Garlemald right now?
[2:04:31] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> My brain went to Portal the game when Pat said portal
[2:04:31] <skyheys> good
[2:04:32] <tactician0> your save gets deleted
[2:04:34] <%Stonebeard> Tanks and they Eulmore airship navy
[2:04:35] <HCWindo> It'll be Avengers all over again
[2:04:35] <+skylaryeah> wait so this mount is from the beats tribes right?
[2:04:38] <ManfredA> Zenos
[2:04:39] <KoyaMusa> i feel there has to be a way to keep first characters in the story, but we'll see on that
[2:04:39] <BallerSwagBro9k> Becomen undead like Paige LUL
[2:04:41] <+TombstoneTTromboners> Zenos
[2:04:43] <+Greywyn00> I don't understand why the beast tribe mounts don't play the beast tribe music
[2:04:43] <+alphonseisbest> Pat WoW X FF14 Patch huh huh?
[2:04:44] <ManfredA> it's Zenos
[2:04:45] <+Yakobro> civil war
[2:04:47] <flatcapgame> zenos' ass
[2:04:47] <%Pompadourius> Isn't it Zenos?
[2:04:48] <+doodoo_tummy> isnt the theory that First-Crystal Tower replaces Source-Crystal tower by teleporting
[2:04:49] <+SergeEXE> Race War was Cancelled
[2:04:49] <Wan6Saber> Lol, Pat is bored
[2:04:49] <clumsydemiurge> zenos don't give a fuck
[2:04:50] <Arnschen> The rival factions
[2:04:50] <%Metballs> BIG civil wars
[2:04:51] <%Pompadourius> Or civil war?
[2:04:51] <+king_of_beggars> I think The First has enough domestic problems without getting involved in ours. They're still living on a postage stamp surrounded by a dead planet.
[2:04:51] <+TombstoneTTromboners> But he cares little
[2:04:52] <%Ebony_Crowe> Worlds merge, Berserk style.
[2:04:52] <%Stonebeard> Whoever can sis on the throne
[2:04:53] <SolsticeZro> probably Super Zenos
[2:04:54] <Arnschen> Zenos doesn't care
[2:04:55] <+FactualAdam> Big fucking civil war
[2:04:55] <+Yakobro> @TombstoneTTromboners zenos don't give a fuck lol
[2:04:59] <plumlungs> Zenos dipped
[2:05:00] <%SomeSageAdvice> right now Garlemald is out of control
[2:05:01] <TioXyco> OH
[2:05:02] <tubit> Zenos just wanna smash
[2:05:02] <%miguelrod777> civil war 2 electric bogaloo
[2:05:04] <nechronia> Man, Varis got cheated
[2:05:04] <+lucaflowe> It's not Zenos, Zenos fucking bailed
[2:05:06] <+alphonseisbest> OOOOOH
[2:05:07] <flatcapgame> the clap of zeno's ass cheeks is the empire's orders
[2:05:08] <aeonicvector> Zenos offically, the parties otherwise
[2:05:08] <TioXyco> that mount is NOT from the dwarves
[2:05:08] <+NitronStreams> When you beat the yorha quest line it resets your game back to 1.0
[2:05:09] <GrandmasterBFunk> Technically Zenos
[2:05:09] <CSeriesJTYPE> nobody knows zenos is alive
[2:05:09] <%Daniel_Is_I> Viera alchemist lookin slick
[2:05:11] <ManfredA> it's effectively Zenos since any one who steps up will get squashed if they get in his way
[2:05:11] <+lucaflowe> Zenos doesn't give a shit
[2:05:11] <%Pompadourius> Crafter outfits looking slick
[2:05:12] <%Shady_Squid> Who's in charge of Garlimald? "Yes"
[2:05:12] <+Onikieran> Just a civil war with dudes fighting for the throne.
[2:05:12] <+Neoripo> Technically Zenos
[2:05:12] <%Stonebeard> zenos went to find his best friend
[2:05:13] <DirtyMiser> Zenos has battle boner. No leadership skils
[2:05:14] <+smevvster> Zenos is still the sole hereditary heir
[2:05:15] <$OmegaWeltall> yea technicaly its Zenos but he's like fuck it
[2:05:15] <%Ciglossonjr> I like that lab coat
[2:05:16] <%danthelazy> Woo Main EVENT
[2:05:16] <+azure22900> Zenos is to busy 'hunting'
[2:05:16] <+alphonseisbest> these look treads tho
[2:05:17] <$Fortunato5678> "I can't show you the mount you get here, but it won't be this one"
[2:05:24] <ManfredA> otherwise noone
[2:05:31] <%Pompadourius> WHAT
[2:05:32] <+masked_hero_lucky> Sweet
[2:05:34] <%Daniel_Is_I> Teamcraft still better but w/e

[2:05:36] <$OmegaWeltall> wow...
[2:05:36] <heartlesshealer> umm
[2:05:37] <%Metballs> Zenos is the official heir, but he's AWOL
[2:05:37] <+Onikieran> THAT'S AMAZING
[2:05:38] <+lucaflowe> There's a reason why it's currently going through a civil war
[2:05:38] <olaksi> It's kind of how Rome had a dozen emperors at once at one point
[2:05:39] <$OmegaWeltall> finaly
[2:05:39] <GreasyDratini> YES PLEASE?!
[2:05:39] <Wan6Saber> ResidentSleeper

[2:06:13] <elbigante> way better to have this shit in game instead of needing to teamcraft
[2:06:14] <%Pompadourius> @Greywyn00 Balance Discord

[2:08:09] <%PulverKong> @Onikieran being up at 8am has never killed anyone
[2:08:15] <%Pompadourius> I love all FFXIV streams. Very few game-related things get me more excited than FFXIV updates. :P
[2:08:20] <+leyf36> Does Trial Synthesis give you EXP
[2:08:31] <JulianLynx> it doesn't, leyf
[2:08:34] <%Pompadourius> That would be broken lmao
[2:08:49] <JulianLynx> let me just gain XP without investment KEKW
[2:08:55] <olaksi> There are so many sources of crafter EXP already
[2:08:55] <MoonKing> i'm gonna miss using garlandtools so frequently
[2:08:56] <Muffinmastr> well nobody whos ever woken up at 8 am survived.. coincidence??
[2:08:59] <+TrueElements> I’m just here for the nerfs
[2:08:59] <JulianLynx> I should check what emoji this channel has.
[2:09:00] <+MakishimaWolf> Drink some coffee Pat
[2:09:00] <%Pompadourius> Have they shown the new trial yet or no?
[2:09:01] <%imbatman37> imbatman37 subscribed at Tier 1. 
[2:09:02] <%terminallyCapriciousz> @Gimplock WoW is an MMO, FF14 is multiple JRPGs with mmo elements stapled on.
[2:09:04] <+leyf36> Yeah, I figured, but I didn’t know if it would be a trivial amount or nothing at all
[2:09:06] <GrandmasterBFunk> that would fuck the market
[2:09:08] <%madskull456> people would just macro xp to max
[2:09:11] <Arnschen> Huh?
[2:09:13] <+MelodyMedley> Nice Superdry shirt

[2:10:03] <tactician0> Final some good food
[2:10:03] <%miabyte> Do you think there will be another expansion for 14 or will there eventually be a whole new mmo instead? FF7R mechanics in my FF mmo? Yes pls.

[2:11:08] <Onmi_Khaos> Has Pat seen the trailer?
[2:11:10] <%terminallyCapriciousz> @miabyte there is at least one or two more expansions confirmed.
[2:11:11] <Dral54> I still love you Garland Tools
[2:11:13] <%Daniel_Is_I> Can you add multiple different items into the raw materials list?
[2:11:16] <JulianLynx> This should streamline the process
[2:11:17] <Onmi_Khaos> BECAUSE I AM THROBBING RIGHT NOW
[2:11:18] <%DamiexDW> if FFXIV were to stop i'd think it would be after 7.0
[2:11:18] <JulianLynx> Yes, Onmi_Khaos

[2:11:30] <MoonKing> "LEVEL CRAFTERS YOU DUMB BITCHES IT'S FREE"
[2:11:35] <%miabyte> @terminallyCapriciousz @Pompadourius oh cool actually happy to hear it
[2:11:36] <+ConLin_Arts_> Make the boy big and strong
[2:11:57] <+NitronStreams> they play the trailer at the start and pat rewatched it in eng during the break
[2:12:07] <%Pompadourius> @miabyte Tbh if there is another MMO it'll be like, FF17 or something like that. Which would be a long while off still, of course.
[2:12:10] <GrandmasterBFunk> lol this cutesy Twintania song
[2:12:18] <%michingmallecho> hasChair
[2:12:25] <clumsydemiurge> FF17 for the Give Up Machine of your choice
[2:12:31] <%terminallyCapriciousz> Idk, I'm down for FF14-2.
[2:12:46] <clumsydemiurge> how about FF14-3 Lightning Returns Again
[2:12:50] <%realm_forge> Hi Pat my sleep schedule is also 8 kinds of fucked!
[2:12:55] <Gimplock> <3 <3
[2:13:06] <+FactualAdam> FF14 is really good
[2:13:08] <$Fortunato5678> Right around the time they finally retire XI
[2:13:15] <ManfredA> they've established they have a 10-year plan for 14
[2:13:17] <+doodoo_tummy> still have like 3 expensions to go imo
[2:13:19] <ManfredA> and it's currently year 6
[2:13:27] <+Crasgnab> h
[2:13:27] <Hazerto> Is the trailer safe to watch if i am at 5.1
[2:13:28] <%Pompadourius> Yeah, 14 would need to become the new 11 for another FF MMO to come out.
[2:13:28] <%realm_forge> This is the most boring Japanese game show I’ve ever seen
[2:13:30] <+alphonseisbest> pat got most of US into 14
[2:13:32] <%miabyte> dope
[2:13:33] <SolsticeZro> so we merged every single FF game into FF14, time to burn it LUL
[2:13:34] <+MelodyMedley> They're gonna keep 14 going for a while more I'm sure
[2:13:35] <olaksi> This is what funds Nomura's drugs, they have to keep it going as long as possible
[2:13:37] <JulianLynx> No, @Hazerto
[2:13:37] <ManfredA> @Hazerto no
[2:13:42] <%AnIcedCoffee> i'll take another 8 years of ff14 if they finally add a z-axis on jumps
[2:13:47] <%miabyte> was 11 terribad?
[2:13:51] <ManfredA> rule of thumb, never watch a trailer you're not caught up on
[2:13:55] <%miabyte> never touched it
[2:13:58] <+lucaflowe> @PatStaresAt think that eventually they'll go the FF 11 route where the story ends but they just keep adding more shit just because?
[2:14:01] <%Pompadourius> 11 is good for the right crowd and bad for the wrong crowd
[2:14:03] <%michingmallecho> This is what makes 7make possible
[2:14:03] <RavenHellkite> LUL
[2:14:03] <+alphonseisbest> @miabyte nah just outdated
[2:14:06] <+PlaneWalkerDavid> No, 11 is great, just big old
[2:14:06] <SolsticeZro> Way too late for this one
[2:14:07] <TioXyco> PogChamp
[2:14:09] <+Lost_Zombie> 11 was great just ate up massive amounts of your time
[2:14:09] <+doodoo_tummy> lmao
[2:14:09] <JulianLynx> Dude nice
[2:14:09] <+SergeEXE> LUL LUL LUL LUL
[2:14:13] <%Rumbutt> oroLUL
[2:14:15] <ManfredA> 11 is an old style MMO
[2:14:15] <SolsticeZro> This should have been a thing a long time ago
[2:14:17] <SnakeMarcky> Did the Nidhogg fight yesterday... the song... man, what a fight !
[2:14:18] <ManfredA> aka Everquest
[2:14:21] <JulianLynx> Maybe I'll finally get into crafting
[2:14:22] <%terminallyCapriciousz> @miabyte FF11 is the next evolution of Everquest. Great game, but very old.
[2:14:25] <olaksi> Desynth is almost useless
[2:14:27] <+leyf36> What do you want to see in the next FF MMO pat?
[2:14:30] <%Pompadourius> I prefer 14 just because I prefer the new style of MMOs to the old style, overall.
[2:14:38] <ManfredA> asses
[2:14:41] <ManfredA> give Eorzea asses back
[2:14:46] <%Pompadourius> LMAO
[2:14:48] <+masked_hero_lucky> LUL
[2:14:49] <RavenHellkite> lmao
[2:14:53] <+doodoo_tummy> why did you even level desynth after they made it trivial
[2:14:54] <LittleBigQuebec> MOMORA
[2:14:58] <TioXyco> OF COURSE IS ALOMOMORA
[2:15:00] <CitrusDrink> well shit that would've been useful a few months ago
[2:15:00] <%realm_forge> That shirt is rad af
[2:15:01] <SolsticeZro> Pat with all deynsthesis at max FeelsBadMan
[2:15:01] <+doodoo_tummy> that's on you dumbass
[2:15:08] <Badpest> ez bobberSmug
[2:15:13] <%ToneBacas> wow this is super early Pat
[2:15:17] <%Dwarven_Gaming> FUCK YOU MOMORA
[2:15:18] <%Pompadourius> HOURS ERASED
[2:15:18] <SolsticeZro> FINE SAND x1000
[2:15:19] <clumsydemiurge> It's at least a C+
[2:15:20] <cinless> please explain the joke
[2:15:21] <%Rumbutt> ahhahahahaaha
[2:15:21] <%Dwarven_Gaming> SO MANY HOURS
[2:15:22] <+Greywyn00> I have lvl 80 fishing and I don't get it
[2:15:26] <%Pompadourius> HOURS MADE POINTLESS
[2:15:31] <LittleBigQuebec> time to turn the momora into mince meat
[2:15:32] <Arnschen> Get that Momora outta my inv
[2:15:33] <%Daniel_Is_I> ONE AT A TIME
[2:15:35] <+Greywyn00> SIT FOR HOURS LUL
[2:15:40] <%Shady_Squid> hahahahahaha
[2:15:44] <$OmegaWeltall> one by one by one by one
[2:15:44] <RavenHellkite> afk desynth LUL
[2:15:46] <%danthelazy> omg
[2:15:47] <skyheys> holy shit
[2:15:47] <TioXyco> it has to roll what you get each desynth
[2:15:48] <%Pompadourius> OOF
[2:15:50] <+ConLin_Arts_> sbfpYeyeye sbfpYeyeye sbfpYeyeye
[2:15:51] <olaksi> The rest of the event is just thus LUL
[2:15:52] <+doodoo_tummy> i thought it would be all at once
[2:15:53] <+MephioTV> I'm gonna make some coffee...
[2:15:54] <TigerClaws12> WASTE YOUR MONTHLY HOURS BITCH LUL
[2:15:54] <+SergeEXE> monkaS
[2:15:56] <+MelodyMedley> Oh boy
[2:15:56] <JulianLynx> Well, at least you can get a coffee while it chugs away.-
[2:15:57] <%Pompadourius> Just grab a drink and come back later
[2:15:57] <+Greywyn00> WHY WOULD YOU DO THIS
[2:15:57] <jase__x> THATS AWFUL
[2:16:00] <%zestyArsenic> has to account for skill point gains i guess
[2:16:01] <$Fortunato5678> Let's watch the whole stack, only way to rival the hype of the photo mode segment
[2:16:01] <zecht89> lmao
[2:16:01] <+Hilleltaco> Same as quick crafting I guess
[2:16:01] <+king_of_beggars> At least it's fast.
[2:16:01] <SolsticeZro> OFC or do you want to break the servers? LUL
[2:16:02] <+Neoripo> Just like dark souls
[2:16:03] <TioXyco> EVERY desynth is a dice roll, so... you can't calculate all at once
[2:16:04] <%fetrigon> OMEGALUL
[2:16:04] <%realm_forge> I’m on the edge of my seat......I should scoot back that’s dangerous
[2:16:06] <RavenHellkite> you like them SAND
[2:16:11] <JulianLynx> Much faster than clicking one by one by one
[2:16:13] <+NitronStreams> THIS IS YOUR LIFE NOW
[2:16:15] <GingerSen> dice roll rules
[2:16:15] <+lucaflowe> Netflix and Destyh
[2:16:16] <+masked_hero_lucky> Why would you expect it not to be one at a time?
[2:16:24] <+desfore> I mean, if you run out of inventory space in the middle, it has to stop partway through
[2:16:31] <+smevvster> Not only does every Desynth roll it's own chance on items, but every desynth ups your level to an extent, changing what you get.
[2:16:33] <Zeetma> well it's something
[2:16:34] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> yeha but they could just give you 10 or 100 at a time though
[2:16:34] <%AnIcedCoffee> lmao it'd be faster if they just made it like eureka lockboxes
[2:16:35] <+ScrapSentinel> it has to roll the desyth table and adjust level gains for each desynth, chat.
[2:16:35] <CitrusDrink> for those keeping track, desynthing a stack of 999 like that would take just under 50 minutes
[2:16:45] <+doug_famous> Walking around with a literal beach in your packets.
[2:16:49] <+smevvster> STILL better than having to go through all of them one by one manually.
[2:16:51] <+Greywyn00> it could at least be FASTER
[2:17:05] <Ilsee16> 1 step forward, 2 steps back
[2:17:07] <+ScrapSentinel> its already faster
[2:17:10] <%Pompadourius> Tbf the animation is faster than doing it manually.
[2:17:10] <+king_of_beggars> It's so much faster, you're all crazy.
[2:17:17] <ShoMibu> zentreBanana zentreBanana zentreBanana
[2:17:17] <TioXyco> I still say that's a QoL over having to do it manually
[2:17:19] <%realm_forge> Yesssss grind! Grind your life away you filthy nerds!
[2:17:29] <SolsticeZro> it is faster than doing it by hand all the time
[2:17:29] <+Greywyn00> I meant the actual desynth bar
[2:17:30] <JulianLynx> It's much faster than having to menu for Every. Single. Goddamn. Fish.
[2:17:30] <+smevvster> "1 step forward, 2 steps back" This is purely a step forward from the current form, you're crazy.
[2:17:34] <%Stonebeard> Just set it up to desynth before you go eat dinner or something
[2:17:40] <+Greywyn00> as in the time it takes to perfom 1 desynth
[2:17:43] <+desfore> This is no way "two steps back" This isn't great, but it's better
[2:17:47] <Marsaline> Aww cute!
[2:17:51] <TioXyco> pteranodon
[2:17:58] <%Pompadourius> It's the best possible way to desynth given how the rolling and skill level ups work.
[2:18:01] <+king_of_beggars> THERE SHE IS
[2:18:10] <+smevvster> Remember, non-perfect solutions are USELESS and REGRESSIVE
[2:18:13] <Onmi_Khaos> How the fuck does YoshiP play with this layout?
[2:18:16] <+Onikieran> BOSS-CHAN
[2:18:16] <+smevvster> fucking crazies
[2:18:20] <+ScrapSentinel> INTO THE CUM JAR WITH YOU
[2:18:23] <%Pompadourius> What is with that chibi Fate servant?
[2:18:25] <%Ciglossonjr> Oh it's the big lady everyone wants to fuck
[2:18:30] <+Onikieran> NOOOO
[2:18:46] <KoyaMusa> pain
[2:18:48] <%thegreatbambe> who was that
[2:18:49] <%realm_forge> Real high intensity stream right here
[2:18:50] <%Ciglossonjr> Does she have a minion animation where she steps on me
[2:18:50] <+masked_hero_lucky> Let's see those houses
[2:18:51] <+Greywyn00> I love the Ivalive art style man
[2:18:55] <+Greywyn00> Lvalice
[2:18:55] <RavenHellkite> suffering
[2:18:57] <+TombstoneTTromboners> nothing
[2:18:58] <snowmanse> I demand more dragon lore
[2:18:59] <+Greywyn00> Ivalice
[2:19:00] <+ConLin_Arts_> sbfpSetIn
[2:19:01] <+Greywyn00> my gad
[2:19:03] <%Pompadourius> NO HOUSING YET?
[2:19:04] <$Fortunato5678> Red Light District
[2:19:04] <RavenHellkite> erp zone
[2:19:06] <+ScrapSentinel> nothing :)
[2:19:10] <%Daniel_Is_I> Work hard for that FUCKIN TITLE
[2:19:11] <SolsticeZro> It will become a museum and we will all be Jebaited thinking it's for housing
[2:19:14] <+alphonseisbest> idk man could be anything
[2:19:17] <Onmi_Khaos> It's going to involve me personally murdering other FC leaders to snag a medium for my company
[2:19:18] <FairOnFire> mystery for the ages
[2:19:18] <+TombstoneTTromboners> i also know someone who will get top rank on Crystal
[2:19:21] <tactician0> not housing
[2:19:23] <+king_of_beggars> I got top ranked on my server. *sips coffee*
[2:19:24] <DarknessD42> "Why are we here, just to suffer?"
[2:19:28] <%MegboyManuel> lets go Nox! o/
[2:19:30] <RavenHellkite> we will give it to the homeless that are right next to it
[2:19:31] <elbigante> man I got a top rank last time, I'm not ready
[2:19:37] <Onmi_Khaos> Especially on Excalibur where I am
[2:19:38] <%realm_forge> Pat I’m already tearing my heart out with the tension in this stream
[2:19:38] <+doodoo_tummy> someone in my FC got a title and he's not even a huge crafter
[2:19:39] <T_Sasquatch> Wow this is still going on
[2:19:40] <%MegboyManuel> Nox Top Rank??
[2:19:42] <RavenHellkite> the homeless people are like right next to it
[2:20:02] <Onmi_Khaos> The fact I'm a DOUBLE HOME OWNER on Excalibur makes me a Double Heretic
[2:20:11] <+Greywyn00> that's a good title you crafter guys are fucked
[2:20:15] <%Metballs> Lore-wise it'll go to the homeless people, but we'll be allowed to have one
[2:20:15] <LittleBigQuebec> Beta of the Firnament LUL
[2:20:20] <elbigante> NO I LIKE THAT TITLE
[2:20:22] <+king_of_beggars> Even if they open the Ishgard housing district, it's still going to be overcast and ugly.
[2:20:23] <%realm_forge> Get him Elmo! Attack!
[2:20:27] <%Pompadourius> Saint Ascendant? Holy shit.
[2:20:36] <%Daniel_Is_I> @Metballs You mean one guy will be allowed to have 50
[2:20:44] <Skelegon> Fix Plot timers
[2:20:54] <vagabonddaniel2> How long is this presentation?
[2:20:59] <KoyaMusa> i don't want to get top 12 again i'm not strong enough
[2:21:03] <TioXyco> longer than usual
[2:21:10] <%Gondab> Gondab subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 2 month streak! I'm up, I'm up! Been on a journey to get everything to 70 and wipe away the important stuff left pre SHB, in the last few months I've done Alexander, Omega, and the warring triad, as well as only have a few levels of Sam and twenty levels of Bard to go.
[2:21:17] <SolsticeZro> these titles are bait
[2:21:29] <%Pompadourius> How hard is top 12?
[2:21:38] <elbigante> super hard
[2:21:45] <%Daniel_Is_I> Hard enough to not be worth the effort
[2:21:45] <elbigante> I have to no-life for several days
[2:21:47] <%danthelazy> depends how big your server is
[2:21:48] <SolsticeZro> really hard, check the current rankings
[2:21:52] <%Pompadourius> Dammit. I want that title though.
[2:21:53] <+ConLin_Arts_> LUL
[2:21:54] <%Pompadourius> It's so stupid and anime.
[2:21:55] <%toastybites> those NEET whales
[2:22:00] <KoyaMusa> imagine crafting/gathering basically your entire waking hours for 10 days
[2:22:08] <GingerSen> I work a retail job and just barely made it to 6th on Balmung..
[2:22:09] <+desfore> you have to imagine, you're competing for 12 spots, against THOUSANDS of people
[2:22:09] <%heyitsbrian> No lifers? How can you kill... which has no life?
[2:22:13] <+doug_famous> I can't wait to show off the title of Beta
[2:22:14] <TheZillex> tfw got rank 1 on my server. I never want to do it again
[2:22:14] <%Pompadourius> I DON'T want to imagine that.
[2:22:15] <k7991> Sounds like coward talk to me
[2:22:16] <+doodoo_tummy> Beta crafter
[2:22:17] <%Pompadourius> :(
[2:22:20] <Muffinmastr> no lifers
[2:22:21] <+Quaraezha> You have to crafting everyday on one Crafter Job
[2:22:21] <%Daniel_Is_I> Spend a couple million gil a day on resources and just craft for 100 hours straight
[2:22:23] <+king_of_beggars> In Japan "No-Lifers" are called "Haijin"
[2:22:38] <%Ixiah> @PatStaresAt will you stream the microsoft event this week ?
[2:22:40] <elbigante> Especially hard when you're self sufficient and have to gather for 4 hours then craft for another 4
[2:22:45] <+alphonseisbest> hey @PatStaresAt is there something like ironworks gear at 60 and 70?
[2:22:52] <%Pompadourius> A couple million a day? My life savings currently is only 4 mil. lmao LUL
[2:22:55] <%thegreatbambe> not if the bots have anything to say
[2:22:56] <Muffinmastr> says the man whos been secluded to his house for half a year
[2:23:02] <+Quaraezha> Worst part is that you can’t Macro Expert recipes
[2:23:04] <+Crasgnab> imagine how the 13th place or 101st must feel like LUL
[2:23:05] <%MegboyManuel> Lets move Elmig too
[2:23:06] <SolsticeZro> Kind of wish Ishgard housing would be in a mountain area not in Foundations
[2:23:06] <%VHGS> I don't have to worry about this because I will NEVER take off the Mahjong Master title.
[2:23:07] <aeonicvector> @alphonseisbest yes, idyllshire and Rhalgar's reach have em
[2:23:09] <+Quaraezha> You have to manually craft them
[2:23:11] <%Daniel_Is_I> @alphonseisbest Shire at 60 and Scaevan at 70
[2:23:18] <%MegboyManuel> Move Elmig to the La Noscea housing district.
[2:23:20] <+Greywyn00> @alphonseisbest shire and scaevan gear
[2:23:30] <+doug_famous> Buying a house in FFXIV right now suuuuuuucks
[2:23:34] <Onmi_Khaos> Pat you're a streamer, people will buy houses then offer them to you
[2:23:35] <+alphonseisbest> @aeonicvector @Daniel_Is_I thx
[2:23:42] <%Ixiah> wow this influencer energy Kappa
[2:23:46] <Onmi_Khaos> You literally have nothing to worry about
[2:23:50] <+alphonseisbest> thx chat
[2:23:55] <+Greywyn00> housing in this game is an absolute nightmare
[2:23:57] <RavenHellkite> you can't do that anymore
[2:24:00] <%Daniel_Is_I> House timers are also turned off right now so people who are inactive aren't losing their houses
[2:24:02] <elbigante> you get banned hard and it doesn't even work
[2:24:03] <%Pompadourius> I got a small in the Goblet going off of that godawful RNG timer system with my friend and that's good enough for me.
[2:24:07] <JulianLynx> I'm never getting a house again after I lost my own after taking a break.
[2:24:13] <%Pompadourius> Though we're gonna try for a medium in Ishgard anyway.
[2:24:17] <+SergeEXE> My girlfriend had a freak out trying to buy a house in Cactuar
[2:24:27] <+desfore> you... can kinda work it, but it's not worth it
[2:24:37] <%Typhaeon> I always burn out on 14, try to come back, see how much of a hill I have to climb to get back to "normal", then give up
[2:24:39] <+Quaraezha> I had to use a script to win my house last month
[2:24:43] <+Quaraezha> And it was just a small
[2:24:43] <Onmi_Khaos> I have a small in the Goblet personally and I brought the FC hall in the Beds. I wanna get the FC a medium when Ishgard hits.
[2:24:46] <%Shady_Squid> @JulianLynx did they delete all you furniture? or is it returned to you?
[2:24:49] <SolsticeZro> Best chance to get your house of choice is at release of the district, right after the maintenance
[2:24:53] <+Quaraezha> Plots never open anymore
[2:24:54] <%realm_forge> Pat stop playing pocket pool on stream. Have some dignity man!
[2:24:54] <GingerSen> 3.3 I got mine during the big house rush on Balmung
[2:24:59] <TheWiggly> My FC has a medium i think in Shirogane and thats perfectly fine
[2:25:02] <%toastybites> oh man Pat big sleep drunk
[2:25:02] <%Cbenson> Cbenson subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 15 months! 
[2:25:08] <Cubblesv2> I camped a small plot in the Mist for like... 9 hours to get it. It was grim but it was the only empty plot I saw for weeks
[2:25:09] <%danguinplays> You're a respectable and honorable influencer
[2:25:11] <%MegboyManuel> Some folk here dont understand how LONG pat's been in this game
[2:25:12] <DrDenorax> Are we supposed to be understanding what they're saying this stream? Any subtitles?
[2:25:17] <%SomeSageAdvice> relocation is a thing so Pat doesnt even have to rely on other people anyway, his group can just walk up and snag it
[2:25:21] <%MegboyManuel> Pat's massive boomer energy in ff14
[2:25:22] <OToole42> Pat, I'm up for work, how are alive at this hour?
[2:25:24] <ne0bunny> I hear they stopped houses being auto demolished because of covid
[2:25:26] <JulianLynx> There's a grace period to get a return on your furniture, or an 80% return on your gil. However, said grace period had long gone, since I stopped around 4.3 and returned in 5.2 @Shady_Squid
[2:25:34] <%Pompadourius> @DrDenorax Nah, mostly just seeing the cool shit
[2:25:37] <JulianLynx> 80% return on spent gil*
[2:25:37] <%ToneBacas> maybe
[2:25:38] <%Daniel_Is_I> Do it at 4 AM
[2:25:39] <+alphonseisbest> do they still do apartments in 14?
[2:25:39] <+smevvster> They stream this live, how are they supposed to do subtitles.
[2:25:41] <DiscoNinjaWolf> Don't
[2:25:41] <%Pompadourius> The trick is to be determined
[2:25:42] <+datmegamandeeeee> Yeah, i bought my small plot with my own money
[2:25:43] <%Pompadourius> And stand there
[2:25:44] <+TombstoneTTromboners> be on a low-pop server
[2:25:46] <iosephe> be a crafter
[2:25:46] <JulianLynx> @PatStaresAt Don't?
[2:25:46] <+masked_hero_lucky> Stand at a housing plot and mash buy until you get it
[2:25:47] <%Pompadourius> Forever
[2:25:47] <+desfore> Get a Small house first
[2:25:47] <DrDenorax> @Pompadourius ah,.gotcha.
[2:25:47] <+CelioHogane> no
[2:25:48] <+TombstoneTTromboners> that's the trick
[2:25:48] <%Daniel_Is_I> @alphonseisbest Yes
[2:25:51] <+callowbrodie> I just have a room at my guild house. Combined resources
[2:25:52] <CSeriesJTYPE> "Dont"
[2:25:52] <+Crasgnab> @DrDenorax the ff14 dsc servers have live translation
[2:25:52] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> Is it get a job and work hard just like IRL?
[2:25:57] <%miguelrod777> buy in a old district
[2:25:58] <%realm_forge> Don’t ?
[2:26:01] <TigerClaws12> just have money 4Head
[2:26:03] <Onmi_Khaos> Don't give a shit and just see if it's open and if it isn't, eh
[2:26:04] <Muffinmastr> the trick is: get a job
[2:26:05] <%ToneBacas> be rich *takes note*
[2:26:06] <flatcapgame> just don't be poor
[2:26:06] <aeonicvector> and pay people to fuck off the plot?
[2:26:06] <+Quaraezha> RELOCATION
[2:26:08] <+Greywyn00> I only have like 8 mil :(
[2:26:09] <%Pompadourius> A billion gil doesn't help if you can't buy anything with that RNG timer system.
[2:26:13] <DrDenorax> @Crasgnab oh, okay. Thanks.
[2:26:13] <KatabolicRage> I can't into crafting and I think my 2m is a massive amount
[2:26:13] <Arnschen> Aww that Gaelikitten
[2:26:14] <%Zundelle> that's a neat trick I'll try it out sometime
[2:26:15] <Zeetma> i spent 20 mil for mine
[2:26:17] <tubit> Fuck that
[2:26:17] <Onmi_Khaos> THAT IS ALSO TRUE
[2:26:19] <olaksi> This isn't game advice, this is life advice!
[2:26:20] <%Typhaeon> Same Grey
[2:26:23] <+MelodyMedley> What are those clothes?
[2:26:24] <+TombstoneTTromboners> ha
[2:26:25] <JulianLynx> I actually got a Goblet cottage in Odin without much issue... but that's because it was the Goblet.
[2:26:25] <%Shady_Squid> @JulianLynx Oh yikes thats rough. My firend always complains about that from when they lost their house. Wasn't sure it was still done that way or not.
[2:26:26] <%realm_forge> Yeah stop being poor ya plebs
[2:26:30] <%Daniel_Is_I> Yes just buy people to buy it for you
[2:26:35] <%MegboyManuel> Man, imagine having more than 100k gil?
[2:26:36] <KatabolicRage> you think he's joking but people do that shit
[2:26:39] <2Sam4Hall> I spent 17 hours camping for my house :)
[2:26:42] <Onmi_Khaos> No you don't need to buy people
[2:26:52] <Onmi_Khaos> Everyone walks around with 20 million or whatever in pocket
[2:26:52] <aeonicvector> This is why we just need an apartment complex
[2:26:53] <%PulverKong> pretend to be a girl then get it for free
[2:26:56] <JulianLynx> @Shady_Squid It was like 3.5m gil, gone and reduced to atoms.
[2:26:58] <%Daniel_Is_I> I have 10m gil right now and it's the fucking most I've ever had
[2:26:59] <SolsticeZro> you mean 50 mil, that is the highest price for a large house of the highest grade
[2:27:00] <+TombstoneTTromboners> steam
[2:27:00] <Onmi_Khaos> And the moment it opens, you all swarm every ward.
[2:27:01] <+Rose_Silvers> or just buy a small in the goblet, cos goblet always has free houses
[2:27:04] <+Greywyn00> LEAKED
[2:27:04] <%SomeSageAdvice> @MegboyManuel i always sit at around 2 million gil so money is not an issue

[2:27:12] <+alphonseisbest> SWTOR
[2:27:13] <+Loinclothiclese> elmos trying to game
[2:27:14] <%Pompadourius> I just cranked out the energy drinks and stood next to a plot clicking on it for 20 hours until it opened.
[2:27:14] <bleugh> gamer cat
[2:27:14] <BallerSwagBro9k> OH NOOOOOOO
[2:27:14] <+TombstoneTTromboners> elmo wants to play video game

[2:27:21] <%Daniel_Is_I> @SolsticeZro No, he means enough to give to like 40 people so they can all try to buy that house
[2:27:21] <+Quaraezha> What about players with no houses, who cannot relocate and have to wait for the hidden timer? No amount of gil can fix that
[2:27:22] <%Typhaeon> Elmo want VRChat
[2:27:26] <%danguinplays> Sweet, I'll take off work just so I can get a house in a video game

[2:27:29] <+alphonseisbest> ELMO WANTS SWTOR
[2:27:31] <@SSaryn> Never SWTOR.
[2:27:32] <JulianLynx> Which is a shame, because I liked having a place to listen to my Orchestrion without getting returned OUT of the estate after a duty.
[2:27:34] <%PulverKong> Just pretend to be a e-girl simps will give you houses for free
[2:27:36] <%Pompadourius> SWTOR showed for a second, Pat

[2:28:14] <+Greywyn00> give us the DANK secrets
[2:28:16] <%Daniel_Is_I> Eyyy relics
[2:28:17] <KoyaMusa> if you want fake mmo house just be prepared to fight for it
[2:28:17] <%Pompadourius> Or get fucked by the timer for currently existing houses.
[2:28:18] <%realm_forge> Make Elmo stream Fortnite
[2:28:19] <%Pompadourius> And wait 20 hours.
[2:28:20] <Arnschen> Here we go
[2:28:20] <+smevvster> I moved my game to an SSD before Shirogane went live to MAXIMIZE house acquisition speed.
[2:28:21] <%Pompadourius> In front of a sign.
[2:28:21] <%kiiiirsten> oh my god Pat it's 6AM
[2:28:22] <+doug_famous> The fact that that is necessary shows how fucked up housing is
[2:28:23] <+ConLin_Arts_> PogChamp
[2:28:25] <+alphonseisbest> OOOOB
[2:28:26] <LittleBigQuebec> SAVE ZA QWEEN
[2:28:27] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> Finally a Queen's Blade crossover
[2:28:28] <Onmi_Khaos> Oh, you're fucked Quara
[2:28:31] <SolsticeZro> Relic Weapon
[2:28:36] <$OmegaWeltall> i remember last time plots opened they were all sold out in 20min
[2:28:36] <Jontman42> that's what you'd say if there was a dank secret
[2:28:36] <Zebroneath> no secret, only reality
[2:28:37] <%MegboyManuel> Just have a friend who lives in a different time zone
[2:28:41] <Muffinmastr> i can here for dank secrets tho
[2:28:41] <Onmi_Khaos> I brought a house in the beds, just so it would be easier for me to get one in HW
[2:28:45] <%MegboyManuel> Meg lives in a different timezone
[2:28:46] <%kiiiirsten> breaking za law
[2:28:48] <+alphonseisbest> im on ps4 pat i CANT
[2:28:49] <%danguinplays> Lol that makes sense
[2:28:52] <%realm_forge> Wow the Aztecs were thicc
[2:28:52] <olaksi> But SSD is secret next gen technology!
[2:28:55] <ManfredA> ah shit
[2:28:57] <%Pompadourius> New Eureka?
[2:28:57] <ManfredA> RELIC NEWS
[2:28:58] <%Typhaeon> Pay people to be your friends
[2:29:01] <+MelodyMedley> qween
[2:29:04] <+neutralraff> the true secret is to suffer for your gains .
[2:29:04] <ManfredA> so Eureka
[2:29:04] <tubit> It's that simple, huh
[2:29:05] <%Daniel_Is_I> Eureka 2.0: Not Fucked This Time
[2:29:05] <KatabolicRage> ffxiv housing is an absolute fuckfest
[2:29:05] <%Typhaeon> Good life advice in general
[2:29:08] <+alphonseisbest> PS4 LIFE T-T
[2:29:10] <+king_of_beggars> The real secret is to just wait until about two months after an update, and just check every district from the town aetheryte every single day, multiple times. People will lose their houses and you can get them when nobody else is paying attention.
[2:29:11] <%LaughingCatt> so Pyros?
[2:29:18] <%Daniel_Is_I> That's half the size of Eureka, right?
[2:29:20] <+Greywyn00> with the 150% echo now Eureka isn't THAT bad
[2:29:21] <HellishLancer> How do I convince my friends to play FF14
[2:29:22] <KatabolicRage> I still haven't done eureka past the first zone
[2:29:23] <Onmi_Khaos> Pyros was terrible
[2:29:23] <KatabolicRage> it's so bad
[2:29:29] <elbigante> doesn't even need to be on an SSD, you just gotta log in early. when new plots opened up I was able to walk around lavender beds and click on all sorts of placards
[2:29:31] <+the22cstomp> I still hear yiazmat's voice lines through this background ost
[2:29:31] <yukin0tora> Doubt
[2:29:40] <7agabond> Pagos was the worst
[2:29:41] <%LaughingCatt> Pyros was great
[2:29:42] <%Typhaeon> I still need to run BA
[2:29:42] <%Daniel_Is_I> Hydatos is the only decent Eureka zone
[2:29:44] <JulianLynx> I'm just glad there's gonna be an alternative to this.
[2:29:50] <Zeetma> what's better light farming or eureka?
[2:29:52] <Busterinabox> Eureka was so painful for a loner.
[2:29:53] <JulianLynx> I wanted to like Eureka on release but it burnt me out lmao
[2:29:55] <ne0bunny> I didnt even do half of the first eureka zone. I hated it
[2:29:56] <SolsticeZro> Literally Hydatos is the only bareable one
[2:29:58] <ManfredA> Pyros is better than Hydatos
[2:29:58] <%Daniel_Is_I> Pyros is a clusterfuck of mob groups
[2:30:00] <7agabond> The only shit part was Pagos tbh
[2:30:06] <%Fidranth> I never did Eureka, no idea what to expect
[2:30:08] <%Pompadourius> As a mainly solo player, Eureka was hell
[2:30:08] <$OmegaWeltall> Eurika..... ResidentSleeper
[2:30:14] <%Typhaeon> Ice hell forever
[2:30:18] <+king_of_beggars> It's FFXI's Campaigns
[2:30:19] <%Daniel_Is_I> Hydatos is good because you can walk 5 feet and not run into enemies
[2:30:20] <%Pompadourius> Red Mage or Paladin MVP for solo
[2:30:20] <+SergeEXE> what makes it the IVth Legion.
[2:30:24] <%Pompadourius> THANK GOD
[2:30:24] <JulianLynx> OH THANK GOD
[2:30:27] <KatabolicRage> oh wow I don't need to do 1000's of fates to level up so I can actually do the damn story quests
[2:30:28] <+Neoripo> Good eureka
[2:30:29] <%Pompadourius> No FATE trains?
[2:30:31] <+Greywyn00> oh I like that
[2:30:32] <%Pompadourius> No FATE trains please?
[2:30:35] <CSeriesJTYPE> god pagos was bad
[2:30:37] <KoyaMusa> yeah according to interviews you get to storm forts and the like
[2:30:41] <TioXyco> it's not "ye olde MMO" eureka
[2:30:43] <SolsticeZro> Nice so this time we can actually track the quests not like this blind Eureka shit with online guides
[2:30:48] <+Greywyn00> CHOO CHOO
[2:30:49] <%Typhaeon> Christ you should have done that in the first place
[2:30:50] <%Daniel_Is_I> There will probably be fate trains in some form
[2:31:10] <%templar010> I need to catch up before the new patch
[2:31:15] <%Pompadourius> Time to get my Red Mage some hours in again. Solo play once again. LUL
[2:31:17] <KatabolicRage> "deeper" that word worries me
[2:31:18] <+FactualAdam> Basically a big Ghyimlt Dark it looks like to me
[2:31:19] <ManfredA> Fates will still be for relic mats
[2:31:24] <%Daniel_Is_I> Wow that's fuckin dreary
[2:31:26] <%danguinplays> Sounds about right
[2:31:26] <%templar010> and yeah this looks meh
[2:31:28] <%Typhaeon> More obscure bullshit yay
[2:31:30] <+Quaraezha> Extra challenges probably for if you want more than 1 resistance weapon
[2:31:30] <+Greywyn00> 1 v1 the area general while 40 other people watch
[2:31:31] <KatabolicRage> ghymlit dark was cooler than this
[2:31:34] <+Greywyn00> don't eat shit!
[2:31:34] <+Quaraezha> Where story is enough for 1
[2:31:36] <Onmi_Khaos> It's a warzone
[2:31:37] <elbigante> Eureka had story quests moopokeDroopyThink
[2:31:38] <%Daniel_Is_I> See that fortress? YOU CAN GO TO IT
[2:31:47] <%Pompadourius> Ghimlyt Dark is amazing.
[2:31:49] <%Daniel_Is_I> Only 71? Wow.
[2:31:49] <SolsticeZro> Baldesion Arsenal all over again monkaS
[2:31:50] <GingerSen> ghymlit dark was a set piece
[2:31:52] <ne0bunny> its certainly very BROWN
[2:31:55] <Talinu> The whole zone wil be trenches maybe?
[2:31:55] <+smevvster> Man as excited I am for Garlemald stuff, I'm dreading the fucking boring grey/brown wastelands leading up to it.
[2:31:57] <iheartmota> 71?
[2:32:01] <%templar010> hrm
[2:32:03] <KatabolicRage> spare us the "seperate leveling system" bullshit please
[2:32:06] <GrandmasterBFunk> could be the HoH of ShB
[2:32:08] <Freeb0rne> Serves as a sort of Deep Dungeon replacement also?
[2:32:10] <Psyramics> you must if they're letting 7`1s in
[2:32:10] <%realm_forge> What a lovely shade of shit brown
[2:32:10] <HCWindo> @SolsticeZro Baldesions was so cool though.
[2:32:11] <JulianLynx> Yeah, but said story quests were annoying and a pain to grind to, @elbigante
[2:32:11] <DirtyMiser> whooooa is this gonna be lvling like deep dungeons?
[2:32:15] <%Stonebeard> Can we level there?
[2:32:17] <+MephioTV> This would be pretty dope for levelling
[2:32:24] <SolsticeZro> @HCWindo it's pretty good, and unique too
[2:32:24] <+NitronStreams> good news every one, my package got here before the end of the stream
[2:32:34] <%Pompadourius> YESSSSSSSS
[2:32:37] <%LaughingCatt> nice!
[2:32:37] <+alphonseisbest> See that fortress, u can social distance on that fortress

[2:32:43] <HCWindo> @SolsticeZro It was just, so much fun to work together with so many people haha.
[2:32:45] <Zeetma> YES
[2:32:45] <TheWiggly> GOOD PATCH
[2:32:47] <LittleBigQuebec> good idea
[2:32:48] <KatabolicRage> leveling in eureka just felt so slow and unrewarding
[2:32:50] <+MephioTV> POGS
[2:32:51] <+Greywyn00> ALWAYS FILLED
[2:32:52] <aeonicvector> FUCK YES
[2:32:53] <Busterinabox> Welp.

[2:33:15] <aeonicvector> EVEN BLUE
[2:33:16] <+Quaraezha> Perfect. I have a lot of jobs left at 70
[2:33:18] <%Treuan> Smart pat
[2:33:18] <Busterinabox> Hopefully I wont be falling asleep at my keyboard like i was for DEEP DUNGEONGS
[2:33:20] <JulianLynx> I just finished getting every job to 50+
[2:33:23] <%Pompadourius> Ooooooh
[2:33:23] <+doodoo_tummy> WHAT
[2:33:23] <+MephioTV> I can't wait for the thousands of Geomancers and Chemists in this place next expac!
[2:33:26] <KatabolicRage> woah shit
[2:33:26] <%miabyte> dope
[2:33:27] <TheWiggly> LETS GOOOOO
[2:33:28] <+Rose_Silvers> all my classes are already 80 ... ;-;
[2:33:30] <KatabolicRage> they aren't making us get fake levels
[2:33:31] <Onmi_Khaos> I'm currently a 74 Dragoon
[2:33:32] <iheartmota> Thank God
[2:33:33] <%Stonebeard> now just give eureka exp
[2:33:34] <%miguelrod777> WHAT
[2:33:35] <KatabolicRage> just put eureka in the TRASH
[2:33:35] <hoodedlefty> Wait so can you go in at 70
[2:33:38] <elbigante> oh so it's like deep dungeon where you preview shit at 80
[2:33:39] <%templar010> I have so many classes to level
[2:33:40] <ManfredA> it really is DD+Eureka
[2:33:40] <+doodoo_tummy> jump from 71 to your full kit, that's nice
[2:33:42] <%templar010> Im so happy
[2:33:42] <k7991> I wish they'd let me do this with classes under 70, I don't mind 70-80 already, but anything below that is hell
[2:33:44] <SolsticeZro> ?????
[2:33:46] <JulianLynx> 71, @hoodedlefty
[2:33:55] <%Pompadourius> Level a 71 while using its 80 kit? THAT IS SO GOOD.
[2:33:58] <%templar010> AYYY
[2:34:01] <KatabolicRage> I'm so glad they aren't doing that eureka leveling system shit again, that was SO tedious
[2:34:02] <%templar010> THEY FIGURED IT OUT
[2:34:08] <hoodedlefty> Nice
[2:34:12] <JulianLynx> Here's how to make 60-70 not shit: don't do Heaven on High. Deep Dungeons are Deep Cancer lol
[2:34:16] <%danguinplays> This sounds like it makes leveling a bit more bearable and makes it less likely for burn out
[2:34:17] <SolsticeZro> Is that really what this means? Do they not mean like for the future when lvl cap is 90`?
[2:34:20] <%LaughingCatt> Y E S
[2:34:21] <ManfredA> not technically true
[2:34:23] <%templar010> no more hamstringing people with half-done kits and level lock
[2:34:25] <%Pompadourius> They found the ideal version of this system, holy shit.
[2:34:29] <ManfredA> Amaurotine accessories will be vaunted for this
[2:34:30] <%realm_forge> I’m a level 60 turbo nerd with -20 to self esteem
[2:34:33] <Tucker0603> YES THEY SHOULD, I'D FIX EUREKA
[2:34:35] <ManfredA> siince their materia will work
[2:34:41] <%Daniel_Is_I> YES
[2:34:44] <%Pompadourius> More FFXIV streams pls
[2:34:44] <%Typhaeon> No one needs foundation repair, don't do HoH SiD
[2:34:45] <%Pompadourius> Good shit
[2:34:45] <+MephioTV> 61-70 Eureka levelling would be fgreat
[2:34:46] <Reireizei> relic streams :D
[2:34:47] <DirtyMiser> Lets get shiny relics people
[2:34:49] <%Typhaeon> SiS*
[2:34:51] <Reireizei> sounds super cozy
[2:34:56] <+Pars_Librum> @JulianLynx I made so much money running HoH though :(
[2:35:00] <%Daniel_Is_I> I would like more FFXIV streams as well
[2:35:03] <+alphonseisbest> yyeyeyeyeyeyeye
[2:35:05] <aeonicvector> Id watch while in DPS queue @PatStaresAt
[2:35:09] <SolsticeZro> pogey watching Pat grinding Relics while grinding the Relic myself
[2:35:10] <RoxMoxie> This next patch sounds fucking nuts.
[2:35:15] <$OmegaWeltall> pat's gonna take his dick out?! PogChamp
[2:35:16] <+MelodyMedley> Shiny
[2:35:18] <+alphonseisbest> get that dic shine
[2:35:19] <+callowbrodie> Put your dick away
[2:35:25] <%Pompadourius> That's fine.
[2:35:26] <%realm_forge> Fuck yeah sounds like my ideal Thursday night
[2:35:27] <%Daniel_Is_I> THANK GOD THEY'RE NOT LEVEL-LOCKED
[2:35:29] <%LaughingCatt> oh thank god
[2:35:31] <+smevvster> My experience getting every job to max: For levels 61-70, on odd levels, do the most recent unlocked dungeon. For even levels, do Heavon on High. EXCEPT for tanks/healers, just do the most recent dungeon. It's the fastest way I discovered
[2:35:32] <ManfredA> okay that alone is a straight upgrade
[2:35:33] <Tucker0603> fair enough
[2:35:34] <SolsticeZro> that's fair, better than Eureka already
[2:35:40] <KatabolicRage> oh that reminds me did they talk about flying in ARR areas yet?
[2:35:42] <+Quaraezha> Which resistance weapon are you gonna start with
[2:35:44] <JulianLynx> So, slow mount speed or faster mount speed?
[2:35:50] <%DamiexDW> Stares at my all of them
[2:35:51] <%Sausious> i got all of Anemos's so like, let's go
[2:35:57] <SolsticeZro> inb4 everyone storming mog station for the 2 seater LUL
[2:35:57] <Tucker0603> this sounds so fucking perfect
[2:35:57] <%zestyArsenic> got all relics but 3, brd mnk and whm. guess i should finish up
[2:36:00] <+Quaraezha> @katabolicrage yeah. Just beat praetorium and you get it
[2:36:01] <ManfredA> all eureka mounts were tier 1 speed
[2:36:04] <ManfredA> this is prolly the same
[2:36:08] <Mawarup> would i be able to level anything under lvl 71?
[2:36:14] <%Pompadourius> YES
[2:36:20] <RoxMoxie> Show me the axe
[2:36:22] <%Pompadourius> Still no better Dark Knight weapon than Cronus Lux imo
[2:36:23] <Onmi_Khaos> I just know, that I never want to do Book Phase again
[2:36:23] <%Daniel_Is_I> Or a dank as shit DRG spear
[2:36:24] <RoxMoxie> pls
[2:36:29] <+doodoo_tummy> rank system?
[2:36:29] <SolsticeZro> YES Show the weapons, I need to know
[2:36:31] <%Fidranth> Cronus Lux forever
[2:36:32] <+FactualAdam> Just give me that Garlean Centurion armour and i'll be so happy
[2:36:32] <+Greywyn00> the 4th again? but Hydros
[2:36:39] <Tucker0603> SHOW ME THAT PALADIN WEAPON!!!
[2:36:40] <%Daniel_Is_I> Anima weapons are cool but they're starting to get old
[2:36:45] <%realm_forge> Is that the robot those scientists keep kicking over?
[2:36:46] <+gannondaddy> SourPls
[2:36:47] <%Pompadourius> I need something to finally make me consider getting rid of Cronus Lux as my DRK glam.
[2:36:49] <%Daniel_Is_I> And Eureka weapons are UGLY
[2:36:53] <+alphonseisbest> @PatStaresAt where did u get ur current DRK sword?
[2:36:53] <KatabolicRage> oh is there like a moving frontline?
[2:36:55] <For_Temeria> Have they shown relic weapons in live letters before?
[2:36:55] <%LaughingCatt> ah so the elemental levels are literally "Show Me What You Got"
[2:36:56] <%Typhaeon> I spent so many hours in Eureka but I still have a soft spot for that music
[2:36:57] <tactician0> @mawarup no
[2:36:59] <Onmi_Khaos> I need a new PLD sword that's not Lux
[2:37:05] <+Hilleltaco> But how fancy will the WHM branch become. How many particles will be on the wooden stick
[2:37:08] <DirtyMiser> Cronus lux is amazing
[2:37:18] <%Pompadourius> True
[2:37:19] <KoyaMusa> except the monk anima :^)
[2:37:22] <+Yakobro> fire fairy
[2:37:23] <+SergeEXE> I'm grinding my Anima weapons AS WE SPEAK
[2:37:24] <%Pompadourius> Heavensward hit the nail on the head for gorgeous glam weapons
[2:37:25] <Zeetma> Monk anima is underwhelming
[2:37:25] <+Greywyn00> I like the SMN eureka it's on fire
[2:37:26] <+Ghally> bs
[2:37:27] <Skelegon> Just got my MCH Lux its great
[2:37:28] <+SergeEXE> Cronus Lux here I come
[2:37:29] <Arnschen> The Eureka weapons don't really have a great glow
[2:37:34] <%Daniel_Is_I> Areadbhar Lux looks gorgeous
[2:37:34] <%AnIcedCoffee> drg zenith is still the best
[2:37:36] <SolsticeZro> Eureka DRK and SAM weapon are ok but the disco glow sucks
[2:37:36] <elbigante> the anima bow is still one of the best in the game
[2:37:39] <+Quaraezha> Still working on my 6th Anima weapon
[2:37:39] <%LaughingCatt> I will still keep using my giant railroad spike
[2:37:42] <CSeriesJTYPE> SMN eureka is the only one I liked
[2:37:42] <Onmi_Khaos> PLD hasn't had a good fuck off "Holy Sword" since Lux
[2:37:43] <%Stratiotai2> Stratiotai2 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 14 months! 
[2:37:43] <ShoMibu> zentreWTF i read that at as enima.
[2:37:47] <+Boscuito> until my sandungs lux get outclassed my nin weapon aint changing
[2:37:48] <Onmi_Khaos> And I guess Excalibur Zeta
[2:37:51] <%Stonebeard> The only relic I ever finished was SMN LUx
[2:37:52] <Tucker0603> I love my the paladin lux weapon is so sexy
[2:37:53] <+doodoo_tummy> the fire axe, the staff with a thunder fire cloud? bangers
[2:37:53] <Zeetma> dragon gun FTW
[2:37:54] <ManfredA> adds and nms
[2:38:04] <SolsticeZro> I like that "Critical Engagement"
[2:38:07] <+Crasgnab> right image is an arena with boundaries @PatStaresAt
[2:38:08] <Onmi_Khaos> I like the new Relic sword, but it needs to be on fire
[2:38:08] <%Typhaeon> I'll still use my switchblade spear glamour as DRG
[2:38:10] <+Quaraezha> AST anima is objectively the best one
[2:38:12] <%Pengers> mch one makes you look like a magical girl
[2:38:14] <Anr1ck> Lookong back athe the Patch Trailer again, the first music is the FFVII theme, and the song with lyrics is the Amourot music
[2:38:14] <+Quaraezha> Literal galaxy on your palm
[2:38:15] <%Daniel_Is_I> @AnIcedCoffee That's just dumb old Gae Bolg though
[2:38:16] <+doodoo_tummy> The mechanist wep has a coeurl coming out, not a dragon that's for DRG
[2:38:19] <SolsticeZro> it has a death ring around the edge
[2:38:20] <7agabond> the eureka drk sword and rdm weapons look so dope tho
[2:38:20] <%Pompadourius> critical engagements sounds sick
[2:38:37] <TioXyco> it's an instance within an instance
[2:38:44] <ManfredA> trash mobs prolly give you something
[2:38:46] <+Greywyn00> critical engagements are storming the fort
[2:38:47] <%Ciglossonjr> Then why are they even there
[2:38:52] <+Hilleltaco> The only lux I ever did was Cronus, still dunno if I wanna do another
[2:38:53] <SolsticeZro> gotta build that mettle meter
[2:38:54] <%SpcOpsBear> literally trash mobs
[2:39:02] <%Pompadourius> Looking forward to seeing some FF7 enemies in here perhaps? Wishful thinking maybe?
[2:39:04] <%Fidranth> this sounds really cool
[2:39:05] <%Pompadourius> Wishful thinking.
[2:39:08] <%Typhaeon> next is the collab with Miss to put in item worlds
[2:39:18] <%SpcOpsBear> I mean there's a Guard Scorpion right there
[2:39:20] <SolsticeZro> sounds like non stop NM trains
[2:39:21] <%AnIcedCoffee> @Daniel_Is_I I meant Zeta
[2:39:23] <%Typhaeon> NiS you dumbass autocorrect
[2:39:26] <+Loinclothiclese> @Pompadourius do you not see the scorp?
[2:39:27] <KoyaMusa> that scorpion model already exists
[2:39:30] <+FactualAdam> New Magitek stuff
[2:39:31] <hoodedlefty> I heard something about a one on one boss fight
[2:39:32] <+FactualAdam> Love it
[2:39:32] <RoxMoxie> Hasn't there been like four instances of guard scorpion though?
[2:39:33] <%Pompadourius> True, but we've seen Guard Scorpion in the past. What about fish saw enemies?
[2:39:35] <Skelegon> FFVI magitek monsters pls
[2:39:36] <%miabyte> I was literally about to say, is that guard scorpion?
[2:39:54] <%miabyte> OH GOD OKAY
[2:39:55] <Armadageddon> I wonder if the Fortress at the end of this will be like Baldesion Arsenal dungeon
[2:39:57] <skyheys> they sure love using guard scorpion
[2:40:00] <+SergeEXE> HELLHOUSE
[2:40:00] <snowmanse> And the NPC tells you to attack while it's tail is up
[2:40:00] <%miabyte> I'M PLAYING OTHER GAMES
[2:40:01] <%realm_forge> Wow that’s just a boarderlands enemy
[2:40:05] <SolsticeZro> PRESSURE IS ON
[2:40:06] <+SergeEXE> HELL HOUSE!!!
[2:40:12] <%realm_forge> Or did ff14 come first?
[2:40:13] <%Ebony_Crowe> Git gud. @miabyte
[2:40:14] <+CelioHogane> GIVE ME HELL HOUSE
[2:40:27] <%miabyte> hi @Ebony_Crowe hun <3
[2:40:30] <RushUnplugged> bullied into content!
[2:40:33] <iheartmota> oh boy lockboxes all over again
[2:40:34] <+Greywyn00> BROWN EUREKA PogChamp
[2:40:36] <%Pompadourius> I'm big excited for this one.
[2:40:37] <%Daniel_Is_I> It's JUST Eureka, but tweaked
[2:40:40] <%Pompadourius> Dear god.
[2:40:41] <+snausages_> Someone told me SMN got a nerf, any deets yet?
[2:40:47] <%itspapster> itspapster subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! 
[2:40:48] <SolsticeZro> Yeah I'm hooked for this variation of Eureka
[2:40:49] <%DamiexDW> This looks/sounds way better than eureka was
[2:40:51] <%SpcOpsBear> so Critical Engagements are probably just raid bosses inside of an existing instance
[2:40:55] <KatabolicRage> tossing that leveling system in the trash alone has massively improved it
[2:40:56] <+lucaflowe> tri disaster nerf
[2:40:59] <k7991> @snausages_ Just a tri-disaster nerf
[2:41:00] <%thewordofhelix> thewordofhelix subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 30 months! morning pat
[2:41:01] <Arnschen> @snausages_ So far we just heard Tri-Disaster nerf
[2:41:02] <+doodoo_tummy> cool armor too
[2:41:02] <skyheys> @snausages_ tried disaster huge nerf
[2:41:03] <ManfredA> Eureka can be done in an afternoon now
[2:41:04] <%Pompadourius> Eureka's still a good money maker right?
[2:41:07] <Cubblesv2> calling it now - the fort in the background will turn out to be a Hell House variant
[2:41:07] <%Sausious> Anemos was fun but it was fun bc of shout chat
[2:41:08] <+smevvster> I suffered through Eureka JUST for the tank armor glam ngl
[2:41:09] <Skelegon> Buff Eureka pls
[2:41:12] <DirtyMiser> dude elemental armor of fending is still cool looking in eureka
[2:41:13] <KoyaMusa> there's even just some simple qol they could do for eureka i feel they just won't
[2:41:13] <Psyramics> I still gotta do Eureka for the glamour
[2:41:15] <%zestyArsenic> outside of the Judge-like armor, eureka and all can suck it
[2:41:15] <+FactualAdam> Math theme in the background
[2:41:19] <TioXyco> I hope we get FFT ost rolling in this area
[2:41:22] <%realm_forge> I don’t hive time to play this nerd shit, I play DESTINY 2!!
[2:41:26] <ManfredA> @Skelegon they physically can't buff it more
[2:41:30] <Arnschen> Yeah, I still need to do Eureka just for the Ozma mount and the Tank armor
[2:41:41] <ShoMibu> devolver was right,we love this. zentreWOAH
[2:41:45] <Arnschen> Oooof
[2:41:45] <Skelegon> ok
[2:41:51] <%SpcOpsBear> I love that the tank glam is available for DRG in Eureka but the colors don't dye right in my opinion
[2:41:51] <+Greywyn00> yeah\
[2:41:51] <Armadageddon> yep
[2:41:52] <%Sausious> Pyros, second to last
[2:41:52] <KatabolicRage> Eureka feels like I missed the high time to do it, it's all empty as shit now
[2:41:54] <ManfredA> you can knock Eureka out in like
[2:41:54] <Tucker0603> man I fucking want that tank armor.....
[2:41:56] <Arnschen> Yeah
[2:41:56] <%Sausious> Pyros is FINE, but FUCK pagod
[2:41:57] <ManfredA> so little time
[2:41:57] <tactician0> @realm_forge that's rough buddy
[2:41:57] <DirtyMiser> I elemental armor of fending is Pyros I think
[2:42:00] <skyheys> they buffed it hard
[2:42:00] <%Sausious> Pagos*
[2:42:04] <For_Temeria> Black tank armor is 3rd and glowing tank armor is 4th area
[2:42:05] <%SpcOpsBear> No, it's in Pyros
[2:42:07] <%AnIcedCoffee> @PatStaresAt it's a TON easier to get now, I just did it on my alt in a few days
[2:42:07] <ManfredA> seriously it's fucking fast
[2:42:08] <+Greywyn00> the glowy one is Hydatos
[2:42:09] <hydragoon513> Pyros, but Hydatos to dye it.
[2:42:09] <%ClericOfSparda> I guess I actually have to start doing Euteka
[2:42:10] <SolsticeZro> It is, you also have to complete the Baldesion Arsenal multiple times for the full set @PatStaresAt
[2:42:11] <+Pars_Librum> I couldn't play Eureka without getting bored as hell
[2:42:12] <TioXyco> we should make a Eureka Alliance to team up and grind faster for everyone
[2:42:12] <%Daniel_Is_I> @PatStaresAt You gotta get your weapon through Pagos, but after Pagos you can say fuck the weapon and just level to Hydatos and get crystals
[2:42:13] <ManfredA> they made it so fucking easy
[2:42:16] <+Rose_Silvers> they nerfed pagos hard, its easy now
[2:42:16] <Arnschen> If you gather people and do your logs, it doesn't take too long tbh
[2:42:20] <KoyaMusa> hydatos still needs some work
[2:42:21] <%VHGS> Any time you feel like doing Eureka, just jerk off instead. That is literally a better investment of your time.
[2:42:21] <+Rose_Silvers> they nerfed all of eureka
[2:42:26] <DirtyMiser> Elemental armor of fending + cronux lux is a good look
[2:42:33] <%Typhaeon> Sounds neat
[2:42:54] <+SergeEXE> Notorious BIG Monsters
[2:43:05] <KatabolicRage> they nerf it enough to solo?
[2:43:05] <SolsticeZro> "Special Conditions" meaning weather and time again?
[2:43:06] <iheartmota> god bless the red mage army
[2:43:07] <+alphonseisbest> like the rapper?
[2:43:10] <%SpcOpsBear> NMs AND FATEs but you have a limited number of players in the NM fights?
[2:43:12] <%realm_forge> @tactician0 for all it’s flaws the main gameplay loop is fantastic
[2:43:16] <skyheys> Being a NIN main sucks for relics, because we always get huge swords instead of actual daggers
[2:43:20] <%SpcOpsBear> Burning Circle NMs confirmed?
[2:43:24] <+MelodyMedley> Is it weird that I enjoy watching this even though I don't play FF14?
[2:43:27] <hoodedlefty> I wish the Ozma mount wasn’t from Eureka
[2:43:28] <Arnschen> Ohhh, so some people will be locked out
[2:43:31] <SolsticeZro> oh they gonna scale it right away nice
[2:43:36] <%SpcOpsBear> BURNING CIRCLES
[2:43:37] <xWanderingFlame> devilnGasm devilnGasm devilnGasm devilnGasm devilnGasm
[2:43:38] <%Daniel_Is_I> RACE THE TRAIN
[2:43:38] <Anr1ck> what balance chages did they reveal? red mage buffs?
[2:43:39] <+FactualAdam> So a bit like S rank hunts?
[2:43:41] <GingerSen> fuk
[2:43:43] <TioXyco> and those who aren't in battle, can cheer from the sidelines
[2:43:44] <%Pompadourius> @MelodyMedley I think the idea of second-hand hype is understandable.
[2:43:44] <+Boscuito> yeah but then roe daggers end up being the size of potatoes
[2:43:46] <+Boscuito> its great
[2:43:48] <GingerSen> they cant be cheesed by numbers
[2:43:52] <KatabolicRage> even S ranks just get burnt down
[2:43:54] <iheartmota> first come first serve
[2:43:55] <Dral54> ! GEAR BROKEN !
[2:44:01] <+Greywyn00> you get items from the FATES that guarantee you a spot
[2:44:03] <%LaughingCatt> so like Pazuzu & his buddies
[2:44:03] <%Daniel_Is_I> @Anr1ck Monk buffs, bard buffs, warrior buffs, summoner nerfs
[2:44:12] <%Daniel_Is_I> @Anr1ck Also ast buffs
[2:44:17] <%Pompadourius> Ready to get in here on day 1 and sell the glam items for millions.
[2:44:17] <AlexandraReynardine> man, people will cry about not being able to enter those XD
[2:44:18] <%Pompadourius> :D
[2:44:18] <skyheys> @boscuito I hate it BECAUSE I play roe, I still use cracked daggers for glam
[2:44:20] <+Domukari> the limit is gonna cause alot of drama LOL
[2:44:31] <BlueEyesWhiteFatass> paz up????
[2:44:36] <%Typhaeon> @melodymedley It's refreshing to watch a dev team with such clear passion for the game and attention to detail
[2:44:45] <%Pompadourius> Paz can go die
[2:44:56] <%Daniel_Is_I> So it's JUST NMs
[2:45:01] <+Greywyn00> Im suprised this is the 4th honestly
[2:45:03] <%hypermike88> hypermike88 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! 
[2:45:05] <%Daniel_Is_I> Kill enough guys, spawn FATE
[2:45:26] <%SpcOpsBear> These are basically gigantic Burning Circle NMs
[2:45:27] <iheartmota> Bozja finder
[2:45:27] <%Pompadourius> Even if it's similar, the militaristic approach to it flavor-wise is more interesting than Eureka being like "this is FF11 lol".
[2:45:29] <%SpcOpsBear> BCNMs
[2:45:31] <SolsticeZro> This looks like they took this concept from Ishgard Restoration
[2:45:31] <+MelodyMedley> @Typhaeon Yeah, it's not something you see often
[2:45:33] <+zepelinnn1> oh boy do i foresee some drama
[2:45:35] <+SergeEXE> The 4th is WEIRD. It has like NO connection to FF4 from what I can see
[2:45:35] <ManfredA> so basically fuck you afkers
[2:45:37] <Psyramics> this stuff is all 5.35, right? it won't be out on August 1`2th?
[2:45:42] <%Fidranth> It's like an endless war setting and I'm really into it
[2:45:42] <+zepelinnn1> some big dramas around that
[2:45:42] <+Mindtrick_Matt> This looks really fun as someone who just fully caught up in the story. So glad I get to experience this live with everyone else
[2:46:06] <%Daniel_Is_I> It's gonna suck if you help prep the NM but you get beaten to the queue by afkers
[2:46:15] <+Moaradin> NA coordination LUL
[2:46:21] <%SpcOpsBear> >After a queue, you must form parties
[2:46:23] <+SergeEXE> LUL
[2:46:29] <%SpcOpsBear> >Must form parties -after- queueing
[2:46:31] <%cylish> guess I'm going in as a tank
[2:46:33] <%Ciglossonjr> Just run in circles around the boss
[2:46:34] <KatabolicRage> JP players will have zero problems with that, everyone else... eeeh
[2:46:35] <%SpcOpsBear> LUL
[2:46:35] <%Dwarven_Gaming> Objective:survive
[2:46:37] <SolsticeZro> monkaS discuss strategies
[2:46:40] <Tucker0603> oof...
[2:46:41] <%Ebony_Crowe> Not going to lie, this is the type of large-scale encounters I've been yearning for in video games.
[2:46:42] <Anr1ck> its juat the basic, yell inv me
[2:46:43] <+Greywyn00> @Daniel_Is_I I heard the FATES can give you items to guarantee a spot
[2:46:46] <tactician0> lol
[2:46:47] <%ClericOfSparda> Get Ready for that psa1guy
[2:46:49] <OToole42> forming a line AND discussing parties? Good fucking luck
[2:46:56] <TioXyco> it's not a queue tho
[2:46:56] <%Pompadourius> Time to level a MCH to get in the mood. They'd better have some cool glams considering the flavor of this thing.
[2:47:02] <SolsticeZro> just don't get hit 4Head
[2:47:03] <+Hilleltaco> Alright everyone form groups for the project
[2:47:04] <ManfredA> @Daniel_Is_I considering fates give mettle and critical engagements
[2:47:04] <%Daniel_Is_I> This seems like it miiiiight suck a bit
[2:47:13] <ManfredA> afking isn't viable
[2:47:14] <%Dwarven_Gaming> INV PLS
[2:47:24] <ManfredA> critical engagements will have mettle levels
[2:47:26] <Onmi_Khaos> @PatStaresAt Have you ever played the Zero Escape games? 999, Virtues Last Reward, Zero Time Dilemma?
[2:47:27] <%Pompadourius> Oh god, the "inv pls" in shout is real.
[2:47:28] <+smevvster> It's 2/3rds of the instance, so they player limit is relatively forgiving.
[2:47:29] <%Pompadourius> I hate it.
[2:47:31] <ManfredA> people without high enough mettle will get dicked
[2:47:32] <+zepelinnn1> LOOK FOR PF REEE
[2:47:35] <KatabolicRage> and hey, maybe this will do doable without needing to redmage to not die to a single trash mob
[2:47:38] <+datmegamandeeeee> Hunts are terrible
[2:47:55] <%SpcOpsBear> One-third to two-thirds of the instance
[2:48:13] <ManfredA> oh
[2:48:13] <%realm_forge> Dude on the left looks as tired as I feel
[2:48:13] <%SpcOpsBear> So it can range from being "LET US IN, LET US IIIIINNNN" to "we're all rooting for you :)"
[2:48:15] <ManfredA> sick
[2:48:18] <%Fidranth> ding dong
[2:48:23] <%Pompadourius> At least we won't need to worry about leveling up an individual leveling system. That's one major worry out of the way for progressing the content.
[2:48:35] <vaderxyz1970> Wow pat speaks japanese
[2:48:42] <%Daniel_Is_I> I wonder if there will be a support fate like BA for the people who aren't in the fight
[2:48:44] <AlexandraReynardine> thank god, would suck if only one guy for the 8 man party gets in
[2:49:00] <Joustar_> Pat's real time translation skills
[2:49:20] <%Daniel_Is_I> Please no Logos actions either.
[2:49:22] <HomophobicWarCriminal> I do not miss Warcraft at all on my vacation from it...
[2:49:23] <iheartmota> thats how it should be
[2:49:24] <+smevvster> You can change jobs inside the instance.
[2:49:29] <%Pompadourius> You'd never wipe, right? N-No way.
[2:49:30] <%SpcOpsBear> that's TWO alliances though
[2:49:40] <%Daniel_Is_I> I don't :<
[2:49:40] <Tucker0603> I dont
[2:49:43] <%Pompadourius> AST buffs please?
[2:49:43] <GingerSen> Nah fam im astro
[2:49:44] <%Pompadourius> Please???
[2:49:47] <%Stonebeard> no but i have a scholar
[2:49:50] <Zeetma> Nah i Got AST
[2:49:50] <Tucker0603> I have scholar to cap
[2:49:50] <VioletRosefall> that gonna be on heck of a lag festa
[2:49:50] <Cowctus> I don't have any healers at cap LUL
[2:49:52] <%Dwarven_Gaming> if you dont, DO IT
[2:49:52] <iheartmota> they getting buffs
[2:49:55] <GrandmasterBFunk> lol I just did
[2:49:55] <$OmegaWeltall> WHM's kinda fun
[2:49:56] <+Grndmastertrash> AST life
[2:49:56] <%SpcOpsBear> so there will always be some level of coordination breakdown in the larger fights
[2:49:56] <Onmi_Khaos> I don't have WHM to cap
[2:49:57] <%Ciglossonjr> How about a 48 man battle of just DRG tho
[2:49:57] <k7991> Thank god I leveled at least one of every role before I stopped playing
[2:50:00] <iheartmota> ast getting mana regen buffs
[2:50:01] <%Metballs> Everyone should have 1 of each role
[2:50:03] <%Metballs> Do it
[2:50:05] <%SpcOpsBear> welp time to level AST
[2:50:05] <Talinu> A lot of people are going to just decide it's nto worth it if it wipes enough time before of lack of coordination
[2:50:06] <%MegboyManuel> I have an AST at cap!
[2:50:11] <TioXyco> I have a friend that prefers the tank responsability rather than healing, because anxiety
[2:50:12] <+snausages_> I find WHM harder to optimise, where are my easy ogcd weaves
[2:50:14] <%Pompadourius> I do in fact have a White Mage at cap. Favorite healer until Astrologian gets some buffs/changes.
[2:50:16] <%Daniel_Is_I> Please no stupid XP loss
[2:50:21] <+zepelinnn1> dont level a healer, it will make you see that most healers are trash
[2:50:23] <+wjones0415> I have everything at cap
[2:50:26] <hoodedlefty> I don’t have a WHM at cap but I main SCH so...
[2:50:39] <%Daniel_Is_I> I don't like having to ask for a res every time I die in Eureka. I just want to release.
[2:50:41] <+smevvster> There won't be XP loss, it's not using it's own level system.
[2:50:44] <+Hilleltaco> They can probably do the glowstick emote for moral support though
[2:50:44] <Tucker0603> @patstaresat I haven't even picked up conjurer yet. but I have scholar at cap
[2:50:49] <CMash2k> everyone has a healer to cap
[2:50:53] <CMash2k> unless youre a fuckass
[2:50:54] <SolsticeZro> already some of the test players in this picture died monkaS
[2:50:55] <%Pompadourius> Look at the bullet hell that these bosses are going to become if this is a basic one. LUL
[2:51:07] <Kain5707> this isnt until 3 weeks after 5.3 right?
[2:51:10] <+smevvster> Everyone gets synced to 80 and you gain XP for your job - it would make exactly 0 sense to make people lose EXP
[2:51:13] <TioXyco> @CMash2k some people can't handle the healing pressure/anxiety. so...
[2:51:18] <uncledoodsauce> hey pat. is it true that you live on that couch off camera and elmo sleeps on you?
[2:51:19] <%Ciglossonjr> Imagine playing a BLM
[2:51:20] <+Greywyn00> the 1 V 1

[2:52:03] <GrandmasterBFunk> the absolute pressure
[2:52:03] <+Hilleltaco> Oh god everyone's watching
[2:52:04] <CMash2k> @TioXyco i think its stilla good idea to kinda force yourself to get one of em to cap, because you never know
[2:52:09] <Zeetma> THE WHAT?!
[2:52:10] <%Pompadourius> LUL
[2:52:15] <%Daniel_Is_I> DON'T FUCK UP, GIRLS ARE WATCHING

[2:52:34] <%Pompadourius> RULES OF NATURE
[2:52:36] <Zeetma> No pressure
[2:52:36] <wrightlight94> Gurls are watching
[2:52:37] <+doug_famous> Killscreen coming up
[2:52:41] <SolsticeZro> and then you get emote bombed
[2:52:41] <Talinu> The 1v1 better be picked based on some score system otherwise there will be a lot of griefing.
[2:52:42] <+zepelinnn1> no, its only the PT right?
[2:52:43] <Zebroneath> point and laugh
[2:52:44] <+masked_hero_lucky> I can't wait for this to be the way you get it so you have to hope to get the 1v1
[2:52:46] <CookieCutter007> FeelsBadMan the gulag
[2:52:47] <GingerSen> Girls are watching, don't choke
[2:52:48] <+Double_Tap_That> No Party, WHM only, Final Destination

[2:52:52] <$OmegaWeltall> oh boy LUL
[2:52:53] <%LaughingCatt> only the best
[2:52:54] <jdwhalen> Are you back on the two sleeps schedule?
[2:52:55] <%SpcOpsBear> This is when two generals fight to determine the entirety of the battle
[2:52:55] <%Rumbutt> Literally the "Morpheus is fighting Neo" from the Matrix
[2:52:57] <vaderxyz1970> That thing looks so cool
[2:52:58] <+Neoripo> Instance is watching
[2:52:58] <%Pompadourius> Insta-kill AOEs?
[2:52:59] <%Pompadourius> Oh god.
[2:53:00] <TioXyco> @CMash2k I this to tanks, since I'm not used to tanking. but I don't usually tank. but I can relate to people who can't handle
[2:53:00] <iheartmota> dragoons LUL
[2:53:00] <%Th3SmartAlec> but AOEs are delicious
[2:53:00] <Tucker0603> WAIT WHAT?!?
[2:53:00] <%dockelso_> So does everyone get a reward? Or do the rewards only go to the individual doing the duel?
[2:53:01] <%Daniel_Is_I> Don't get hit in the FATE and you get a bonus?
[2:53:02] <+doodoo_tummy> cant wait for all the shitters to get it
[2:53:02] <$OmegaWeltall> THATS not gonna hhappen LUL
[2:53:02] <%Typhaeon> Get good, fucker
[2:53:04] <%ClericOfSparda> Black Mage is fucked
[2:53:04] <CookieCutter007> LUL
[2:53:04] <nechronia> No BLM allowed
[2:53:06] <%aishman> Is this part of the raid?
[2:53:08] <%Fidranth> THAT'S SO COOOL
[2:53:08] <Tucker0603> HOLY SHIT THATS RAD
[2:53:12] <+Double_Tap_That> Oh, so DRG automatically never get it
[2:53:14] <Angry_Ev1L> or cowards
[2:53:16] <+king_of_beggars> "Some guy solo pulled Charybdis. Let's wait for him to wipe so we can steal it."
[2:53:16] <%Daniel_Is_I> BRING IT ON
[2:53:17] <Joustar_> WhY dOn'T i GeT pIcKeD
[2:53:18] <JulianLynx> Boy, I can't wait to fight this in my exhibitionist gear!
[2:53:21] <$OmegaWeltall> checkp2GitGud
[2:53:21] <%dockelso_> Because that's pretty lame if only the solo player gets a reward for this
[2:53:26] <%Ebony_Crowe> It's free real estate for DNC lol.
[2:53:29] <%Daniel_Is_I> @Double_Tap_That Fuck you I'll do it only as DRG and get it
[2:53:31] <fuji_92> so no one's doing that huh Kappa
[2:53:37] <+doug_famous> No healers will ever get picked for this, right?
[2:53:38] <%ClericOfSparda> This is BLM bias
[2:53:40] <Zeetma> Static trials
[2:53:41] <%Pompadourius> NEED THAT
[2:53:42] <hoodedlefty> Sorry Black Mages no 1v1 for you
[2:53:43] <%DamiexDW> time for raids not letting people in eho don't have that mount
[2:53:44] <+lucaflowe> MCH is gonna be able to do this easy
[2:53:47] <%RedKnightVI> Give it a little bit of time. People will bitch enough and get it nerfed
[2:53:50] <+snausages_> I mean if someone has the ramuh mount then they have es8 beat
[2:53:53] <AlexandraReynardine> well shit, now i want that mount XD
[2:53:54] <Kain5707> unless its piss easy @PatStaresAt
[2:53:54] <JulianLynx> BLM has plenty mobility tbh
[2:53:58] <+alphonseisbest> LUL
[2:53:58] <+rmsjrr> Dragoons in shambles, I’m dragoons
[2:54:05] <GrandmasterBFunk> you can also change class
[2:54:06] <+smevvster> I love it. Get good or don't get the reward. No getting carried. People are going to whine SO HARD
[2:54:12] <TioXyco> you probably can change jobs before the engagement too, like before
[2:54:13] <JulianLynx> between Manaward and all the instant casts that BLM gets? easy
[2:54:14] <Psyramics> @snausages_ people are selling e8s clears, so no
[2:54:14] <CMash2k> @TioXyco oh thats perfectly understandable. ive been playing for so long that i just kinda leveled at least one of each type of class lol. magical dps is next
[2:54:16] <SolsticeZro> yes, e. g. for BLM the boss will spam extra many AoEs
[2:54:20] <%Pompadourius> Equip that mount, and NEVER unequip it :D
[2:54:23] <+masked_hero_lucky> My dreams of getting this are pretty much gone
[2:54:24] <%Stonebeard> I can't wait for cool SAM vs Mech duals
[2:54:28] <%Fidranth> this is so cool both mechanically and flavor wise, holy fuck
[2:54:29] <ManfredA> @PatStaresAt the Morbol mount
[2:54:30] <GingerSen> Ozma is kind of like that
[2:54:30] <%Daniel_Is_I> I WANT it
[2:54:33] <Kain5707> remember Pat people thought the Hien instance was hard @PatStaresAt
[2:54:39] <+Greywyn00> better have SICC music on that mount
[2:54:39] <+Quaraezha> LET’S GO 72 TANKS
[2:54:45] <+zepelinnn1> cant wait to get selected and put my frog suit and just dance
[2:54:49] <+Neoripo> cheer from the sidelines
[2:54:50] <%Daniel_Is_I> OH GOD IT'S LOGOS ACTIONS

[2:54:54] <TioXyco> @CMash2k I'm aming to level everything... I want to get my good boy amaro
[2:54:55] <%Daniel_Is_I> NOT AGAIN
[2:54:56] <iheartmota> LOGOS actions
[2:54:58] <SolsticeZro> Lost Actions = Logograms
[2:55:05] <%Pompadourius> Wouldn't it suck to get into the 1v1 and then just die? :(
[2:55:05] <+doodoo_tummy> NOOO
[2:55:07] <%Stonebeard> logos actions did nothing wrong
[2:55:10] <GingerSen> YEAHHH
[2:55:11] <%LaughingCatt> yay Logos actions

[2:55:19] <ManfredA> THEY'RE GREAT
[2:55:20] <GingerSen> logos actions are fun, yall just weak
[2:55:21] <Zeetma> All of them
[2:55:22] <%SpcOpsBear> Logos Actions aren't shit
[2:55:26] <%Daniel_Is_I> @PatStaresAt It was in Eureka, it's on the extra encounter button
[2:55:27] <%Pompadourius> Balance is the GOAT
[2:55:34] <%Daniel_Is_I> They're called Logos actions in Eureka
[2:55:34] <Tucker0603> @trueelements THAT BOSS IS THE MOUNT
[2:55:35] <tactician0> some one said it
[2:55:36] <ManfredA> Logos Actions are amazing
[2:55:41] <vaderxyz1970> Cheater
[2:55:41] <GingerSen> logos actions made glass canons
[2:55:43] <TioXyco> time to learn how to play with souble tab and combo triggers on controller, pat
[2:55:45] <CMash2k> @TioXyco cheers bro
[2:55:46] <%madskull456> pat just speaks japanse
[2:55:48] <%Typhaeon> Logos actions were fun, fight me
[2:55:58] <SolsticeZro> Logograms are nice but you have to either farm or buy them and they are consumable
[2:55:59] <+TrueElements> OOOOO @tucker0603 I thought that was the nier mount
[2:56:04] <%SpcOpsBear> Duty Action buttons
[2:56:08] <+Greywyn00> can some kind soul PM me the Balance Discord link?
[2:56:09] <%SpcOpsBear> PRESS TILDE
[2:56:09] <iheartmota> lmao
[2:56:10] <%Pompadourius> People play controller without double tap? Really?
[2:56:12] <%Pompadourius> I always use double tap tbh.
[2:56:17] <Joustar_> amazing.
[2:56:18] <tactician0> just download more bars
[2:56:20] <fuji_92> good
[2:56:22] <Tucker0603> fucking oof
[2:56:23] <%Typhaeon> Get ready to eat dirt
[2:56:24] <%LaughingCatt> Cowabunga It Is
[2:56:26] <%Pompadourius> LUL
[2:56:27] <+SergeEXE> Double Tap 2 stronk
[2:56:29] <+Greywyn00> LUL
[2:56:29] <+Domukari> 12 seconds before disaster
[2:56:30] <TioXyco> @CMash2k still got a long ways to go, most my jobs are 50~60, my tanks and mains aside
[2:56:37] <%miguelrod777> LUL
[2:56:44] <%Th3SmartAlec> 10 pictures taken before disaster
[2:56:46] <ManfredA> that's impressive
[2:56:48] <%Ciglossonjr> I really need to catch up so I can actually see this in its prime
[2:56:49] <%Daniel_Is_I> So a week after it launches there's gonna be a table listing exactly what to use for every boss
[2:56:50] <ManfredA> because people still do Eureka
[2:56:56] <%aishman> I like the idea of Eureka but man that's a ghost town now
[2:56:57] <%Pompadourius> If this is done right, this blows away Eureka, PoTD and HoH EASILY.
[2:57:02] <SolsticeZro> and because it will probably have a better impression off the start
[2:57:03] <%Daniel_Is_I> People won't do Eureka once this drops
[2:57:13] <Tucker0603> FUCKING SIEGE BATTLE
[2:57:16] <Onmi_Khaos> As it turns out, people will do content, if they have meaningful forward progression
[2:57:20] <%Th3SmartAlec> that's a big-ass ladder
[2:57:22] <SolsticeZro> OOH this is part of the relic weapon area? It's not the MSQ
[2:57:25] <%zestyArsenic> that a big ladder
[2:57:27] <+Greywyn00> this is going to make getting the Ozma mount SO HARD
[2:57:29] <CMash2k> @TioXyco wow thats alot more than me lol, i only have 4 classes at 80 and a drk at 70 something because i wanted to see that story
[2:57:31] <JulianLynx> I'm just hoping the improvements here get retrofitted into Eureka in some form.
[2:57:32] <%NepDraws> NepDraws subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 14 months! What did I wake up to?
[2:57:33] <Joustar_> ladder for GIANTS
[2:57:36] <%SpcOpsBear> WHY IS LADDER SO THICC
[2:57:37] <GingerSen> its for roes
[2:57:38] <%Pompadourius> OHHHHH
[2:57:40] <Arnschen> It's a ladder for Roes
[2:57:40] <Psyramics> imagine a lala trying to climb that ladder
[2:57:42] <%Daniel_Is_I> That ladder teaches you what it feels like to be a Lalafel
[2:57:43] <+Hilleltaco> ladder PogChamp
[2:57:43] <%Fidranth> imported straight from Bannerlord
[2:57:44] <%BigDumBeak> its for the mech to use to get up there obviously
[2:57:46] <iheartmota> What about lalafells
[2:57:47] <%Pompadourius> I thought this was part of the dungeon.
[2:57:48] <%LaughingCatt> looks like a modified version of an FF13 enemy
[2:57:50] <Tucker0603> how the fuck are potatoes gonna scale that ladder? @patstaresat
[2:57:54] <+facenorway> How are Lalas gonna use the ladder?
[2:57:54] <%Kyoshikei> poor lalas
[2:57:56] <+Greywyn00> BIG ladder for THICC Roes
[2:57:58] <CMash2k> how is a potato gonna use that ladder
[2:57:58] <%Pompadourius> That's pretty good.
[2:58:00] <SolsticeZro> SAHELANTHROPUS
[2:58:01] <DarkCloud79> For Pat every ladder is too big
[2:58:01] <Onmi_Khaos> By hoping
[2:58:04] <JulianLynx> By jumping up each rung, duuh
[2:58:04] <+r_Foeburden87> is this 2hrs in
[2:58:05] <+smevvster> The distance between the ladder rungs is further than the height of a fucking Lalafel LUL
[2:58:07] <%VHGS> It's huge but it doesn't have huge guts because robit =\
[2:58:07] <%Pompadourius> 48?
[2:58:09] <%Pompadourius> Oof.
[2:58:10] <+doug_famous> It's like a full meter between steps
[2:58:13] <%SpcOpsBear> @LaughingCatt there's already a couple of FF13 enemy models in the game, so that makes sense
[2:58:18] <+masked_hero_lucky> I'll just jump on a roe's back
[2:58:22] <%Pompadourius> lmao
[2:58:26] <flatcapgame> i wish they couldnt
[2:58:27] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[2:58:27] <+Crasgnab> but how???
[2:58:32] <+MelodyMedley> LUL
[2:58:33] <+smevvster> 48 is still 2/3rds of the entire instance.
[2:58:35] <flatcapgame> llalafel exclusionary ladder
[2:58:36] <SolsticeZro> yeah in 1 hour maybe
[2:58:41] <RushUnplugged> Lalafells can't climb, that's a lie
[2:58:42] <%Daniel_Is_I> A Long Fall is such a good song
[2:58:46] <Tucker0603> fucking how? trampolines?!?
[2:58:49] <%Typhaeon> Chicken Tenders EX
[2:58:51] <%Pompadourius> Yooo. If the flight unit just played the Twinning theme, I'd be okay with that.
[2:58:52] <%Daniel_Is_I> Beef Soft Tacos
[2:58:58] <SolsticeZro> It's a long fall for a lalafell
[2:59:09] <RushUnplugged> is there a lala catapult to shoot them on top
[2:59:11] <+masked_hero_lucky> Skill test
[2:59:13] <%Th3SmartAlec> yes?
[2:59:19] <CSeriesJTYPE> for getting actions probably
[2:59:21] <+Crasgnab> for what
[2:59:24] <SolsticeZro> building lb? LUL
[2:59:28] <+doug_famous> ...go on
[2:59:31] <%Daniel_Is_I> So everyone queues up, pray you get in
[2:59:32] <%Dwarven_Gaming> for action charges i bet
[2:59:41] <%Pompadourius> Careful. Crazy Talk could activate if you say it now. LUL
[2:59:46] <%Th3SmartAlec> Pat: "TOTALLY CALLED IT Kappa "
[2:59:49] <%Dwarven_Gaming> OOOOOOOOOOO
[2:59:50] <%Daniel_Is_I> PREP MOBS
[2:59:53] <%Pompadourius> Oh, that would make sense though.
[2:59:54] <%LaughingCatt> KILL EVERYTHING
[2:59:55] <%Dwarven_Gaming> I GET IT
[2:59:57] <+LailahQueenx> who gets priority priority

[3:00:06] <ManfredA> AFKERS GET DICKED
[3:00:13] <SolsticeZro> ResidentSleeper making me work and shit
[3:00:15] <%Pompadourius> That does seem skewed towards DPS more than tanks and healers though, right?
[3:00:15] <Xenstroke> HA!
[3:00:16] <%Daniel_Is_I> But are there BUNNIES though?
[3:00:18] <LittleBigQuebec> good
[3:00:18] <%LaughingCatt> lobosHype

[3:00:28] <+lucaflowe> Good
[3:00:29] <%SpcOpsBear> psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead 🔫 LUL

[3:00:34] <+Greywyn00> the fucking rabbits
[3:00:35] <+king_of_beggars> The trash mobs probably also give XP, so yeah.
[3:00:37] <Savages4Blood> wait pat you speak this language? that's dope
[3:00:40] <RushUnplugged> dps can't kill stuff without tank&heal support, they're contributing
[3:00:42] <%Pompadourius> Fair enough.
[3:00:43] <+lucaflowe> Do the thing and then you can do the cool thing
[3:00:46] <CSeriesJTYPE> man I caught up on so many LPs during Eureka
[3:00:48] <ManfredA> @Pompadourius if it works like FATES, thentanking and healing counts towards contribution
[3:00:49] <keatiestofthegribbles> AFKERS Go Home
[3:00:54] <%Pompadourius> Ahhh, alright.
[3:01:00] <KoyaMusa> no he's reading a translation discord
[3:01:04] <MoonKing> and you can switch class before the actual boss
[3:01:13] <%Th3SmartAlec> @savages4blood yeah, MMO is a hard language to learn
[3:01:16] <+Greywyn00> GET FUCKED
[3:01:19] <Savages4Blood> oh haha I thought pat was a genius
[3:01:20] <iheartmota> so basically no life this shit week one

[3:02:41] <%Daniel_Is_I> It's up to 2/3rds of the raid
[3:02:44] <TioXyco> Have fun spamming dark arts as DRK in Bozja Front

[3:02:53] <%Fidranth> train suplexed
[3:02:55] <%miguelrod777> the train will just have longer stops
[3:02:58] <%Pompadourius> Ooooh, clever.
[3:03:06] <+lucaflowe> Content is balence around every class so even DPS can 1v1 shit
[3:03:07] <+masked_hero_lucky> Carry weight, fun
[3:03:08] <%Pompadourius> I wonder if there's the reverse so that tanks and healers can get more damage?
[3:03:09] <+LailahQueenx> fat rolls
[3:03:16] <%Pompadourius> FLOOR TANK DRG IS CANON
[3:03:21] <+doug_famous> Tank Blue Mage
[3:03:21] <aeonicvector> and all of them can tank floor
[3:03:22] <TioXyco> but DRG already is a tank
[3:03:22] <ManfredA> yes Pomp
[3:03:24] <Tucker0603> TANK DRAGOON YEYEYEYEYEYEYEYEYE
[3:03:26] <TioXyco> a floor tank, but still tank
[3:03:26] <%Daniel_Is_I> @PatStaresAt In Pyros/Hydatos there were Logos actions that were basically the same thing. Spells from other jobs you could use. Any job could get a rez, etc.
[3:03:26] <%Typhaeon> That is incredible
[3:03:27] <ManfredA> there were logos actions for that
[3:03:34] <badlander2019> Game seems interesting but my laptop will melt
[3:03:39] <Joustar_> F A T D R A G O O N
[3:03:40] <%SpcOpsBear> I've already been a tank DRG in Eureka
[3:03:43] <+lucaflowe> This is actually super sick
[3:03:46] <TioXyco> @badlander2019 play on PS4
[3:03:47] <+Neoripo> DRG is red tank
[3:03:49] <%Ciglossonjr> THATS FUCKING AMAZING
[3:03:50] <%Pompadourius> I love how much thought they put into this. They're accounting for every role and situation.
[3:03:52] <%Pompadourius> I love this.
[3:03:54] <+lucaflowe> It's a better Eureka
[3:03:57] <Savages4Blood> I have never played one of these games in my life. every time I want to I get overwhelmed trying to figure out where to start
[3:03:58] <%Stonebeard> But can we play blu in bozjablast
[3:04:09] <%Daniel_Is_I> We DRGs wore heavy armor when we leveled, time to put it to use
[3:04:10] <+alphonseisbest> @badlander2019 Its on PS4 if u have one
[3:04:13] <KatabolicRage> can we just delete limited jobs
[3:04:15] <%zestyArsenic> this sounds like a gateway to subclasses
[3:04:16] <olaksi> BLU LUL
[3:04:16] <%Pompadourius> BLU as a normal job for 6.0 pls?
[3:04:17] <JulianLynx> No, since BLU only gets to lv60.
[3:04:19] <%Pompadourius> Pls...
[3:04:26] <+lucaflowe> lmaoBLU
[3:04:32] <%Ebony_Crowe> This item system sounds suspiciously like battle Royale mechanics.
[3:04:36] <RushUnplugged> BLU goes to the shame corner
[3:04:37] <%Daniel_Is_I> If it's like Eureka then you'll be able to sell the lost shards to other players
[3:04:40] <KatabolicRage> the problem with BLU is it is forever stuck in old content, I'd at least give a shit if I could do my SHB fate grinds with it
[3:04:43] <%Daniel_Is_I> Because it's probably JUST logograms
[3:04:46] <keatiestofthegribbles> FF14 : Baja Blasst
[3:04:47] <%Dwarven_Gaming> oh they found where that flight boss mounbt is from
[3:04:50] <+ALazo> Can you imagine using blu in new content?
[3:04:54] <+HelloImTom08> not really subclasss tho
[3:04:58] <%Dwarven_Gaming> its from ff type 0
[3:05:01] <+ConLin_Arts_> how much Japanese do you understand?
[3:05:01] <+Moaradin> getting the morbol mount with BLU was pretty fun
[3:05:03] <+MelodyMedley> Feels like the only reason I wouldn't be able to enjoy FF14 is the whole subscription thing
[3:05:06] <+alphonseisbest> @PatStaresAt are u gonna be readong sub messages after the stream?
[3:05:08] <KatabolicRage> Can youu imagine using blu?
[3:05:08] <%SleepyMaribo> this sounds way to tedious...
[3:05:10] <+HelloImTom08> its just extra actions to fill rolls or do dumb stuff
[3:05:12] <ManfredA> no
[3:05:13] <%Pompadourius> Save your consumables, Pat
[3:05:13] <CookieCatte> oh, good, lootboxes, I hear they're real popular these days O.o
[3:05:14] <olaksi> But what if I need it later?
[3:05:14] <keatiestofthegribbles> ew type 0
[3:05:15] <+lucaflowe> I wonder what the drop rate for lockboxes are
[3:05:15] <%Pompadourius> Save them all for the end
[3:05:21] <ManfredA> it's prolly like logos actions where you craft them with shards
[3:05:21] <+Greywyn00> straight up EXACTLY like logograms
[3:05:32] <%Daniel_Is_I> @PatStaresAt In Eureka it was you used the consumables to unlock the actions then the actions were either infinite or had like 50 or 99 uses
[3:05:33] <%Pompadourius> SAVE THE QUEEN
[3:05:33] <s_snowball> LUL
[3:05:35] <TomFrancis_> what are you streaming later?

[3:06:10] <%Daniel_Is_I> No Pat's reading the TL from the FF14 discord
[3:06:12] <%fetrigon> did he stay up all night for this?
[3:06:24] <olaksi> Save the Queen is going to be a gunblade, for some reason this pleases me
[3:06:25] <%Daniel_Is_I> Death penalty is you lose mettle
[3:06:29] <%fetrigon> or just not a morning person? 🤭
[3:06:31] <Lionkevinson> パッとは翻訳してます

[3:08:14] <JulianLynx> Yeah, @korth367
[3:08:15] <%Daniel_Is_I> I wonder if this means you can't de-level from dying, only go down to 0
[3:08:17] <DesertPenguin> Just woke up. Good morning
[3:08:20] <RushUnplugged> pour your rank juice into that guy's mouth
[3:08:21] <%Metballs> But can you bank it so it doesn't go down?

[3:09:13] <+Greywyn00> odd
[3:09:15] <korth367> debuffer
[3:09:18] <%SleepyMaribo> @PatStaresAt thank god this isnt mandatory to upgrade the weapon.
[3:09:20] <%Fidranth> cool
[3:09:27] <ManfredA> yeah those fit for logos actions
[3:09:28] <%Pompadourius> Wait, why is Yoshi P's character level 10?
[3:09:38] <ManfredA> 10 mettle
[3:09:42] <%SpcOpsBear> Mezzer reconfirmed for the holy quadrant
[3:09:43] <%Daniel_Is_I> @Pompadourius Probably Bozja level
[3:09:44] <+Yakobro> yes
[3:09:50] <+the22cstomp> there's 2 different ways
[3:09:50] <+Yakobro> you can do a trial or something instead
[3:09:50] <ManfredA> mettle is your level here
[3:09:51] <+smevvster> That's his rank, not his level.
[3:09:51] <The_Shiznet> he doesn't know PepeLaugh
[3:09:54] <+Pars_Librum> It's his rank I believe
[3:09:54] <+the22cstomp> the other is the classic grind
[3:09:54] <%Pompadourius> Ahhh, okay.
[3:09:54] <olaksi> Yeah, relic weapon upgrades would never be a pain in the ass
[3:09:56] <%Metballs> I imagine one will be free with teh story
[3:09:58] <%SpcOpsBear> It IS mandatory, but not the grinding part of it.
[3:10:00] <%Pompadourius> Makes sense.
[3:10:03] <TioXyco> There is a MSQ for the FIRST weapon, but you can upgrade your weapon OUTSIDE of this
[3:10:05] <Tucker0603> yes, there's two paths
[3:10:09] <TioXyco> there's the two variants
[3:10:12] <%SpcOpsBear> You just need to do the story related part of the instance.
[3:10:13] <+alphonseisbest> as someone who stopped in 16 should make a new Toon or pick my old one at HW?
[3:10:18] <iheartmota> you need to lvl up ranks but ranks doesn't lock you out from certain areas
[3:10:27] <iheartmota> it looks like
[3:10:35] <CSeriesJTYPE> toon
[3:10:40] <ManfredA> it's likely this stuff will be mandatory for the idealized armor
[3:10:45] <Tucker0603> good
[3:10:47] <+alphonseisbest> cool
[3:10:49] <ManfredA> or unique armor
[3:10:58] <%Pompadourius> @alphonseisbest No reason not to keep going with your old character if you remember the story/can get a story recap.
[3:11:03] <+BeefMcCat> Pat translate
[3:11:08] <iheartmota> Oh hey Gerolt
[3:11:09] <%Pompadourius> Ayyy, the bald boy is back.
[3:11:11] <%SpcOpsBear> So it's basically AF4 grinding
[3:11:11] <+Pars_Librum> @alphonseisbest There have been a ton of changes since then but it should be easy to pick up again
[3:11:24] <%Pompadourius> What a Chad.
[3:11:32] <%Daniel_Is_I> Will enemies that are 2 mettle levels higher than you kick your ass?
[3:11:37] <CSeriesJTYPE> gettin real tired of this asshole
[3:11:52] <+alphonseisbest> @Pompadourius its more i dont remember ANY of the dungeon layout/ boss mechanics
[3:11:53] <GingerSen> he did almost nothing wrong
[3:11:56] <GingerSen> Rowena tho..
[3:11:57] <+Greywyn00> Gerolt is great how dare you
[3:12:06] <%MariaMcMuscles> MariaMcMuscles subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! Hey Pat, thanks for getting me into FFXIV back in Heavensward, the last 5 years ive made some lifelongs friends and even met my current partner so thanks so much, hope you're doing well!
[3:12:11] <%Daniel_Is_I> Gerolt stop being a drunk gambler
[3:12:18] <TioXyco> only think gerolt did wrong was get in depot and too much drunk
[3:12:19] <%Dwarven_Gaming> gerolt is great
[3:12:23] <%Pompadourius> @alphonseisbest Hmm. Honestly, you can pick those up pretty handily if you do some roulettes and maybe the guildhests.
[3:12:29] <TioXyco> *DEBT
[3:12:30] <%Dwarven_Gaming> EVERYTHING he did was to save rowena
[3:12:33] <%Dwarven_Gaming> EVERYTHING
[3:12:40] <SolsticeZro> Gerolt of Roovia
[3:12:54] <%Daniel_Is_I> @Dwarven_Gaming Even the getting drunk?
[3:12:55] <%Dwarven_Gaming> he got the debt to save rowena as well
[3:13:08] <%Dwarven_Gaming> well hey, wouldnt you after all tht?
[3:13:14] <+doodoo_tummy> grind or buy with tomes?
[3:13:15] <%Stonebeard> I'm still mad we didn't get to upgrade the stuff from the first's version of Gerolt
[3:13:16] <mistageeza> what on earth am i listening to, this audio book sucks
[3:13:21] <+alphonseisbest> @Pompadourius yeah think im gonna try a lv1 class and see if that helps jog the old noggin
[3:13:28] <aeonicvector> prob outside or poverty out your tomes
[3:13:34] <+SergeEXE> @Stonebeard ME TOO
[3:13:44] <%SleepyMaribo> they want everyone to get a relic weapon
[3:13:50] <%Daniel_Is_I> I wonder if Bozja will give a shitton of poetic
[3:13:52] <%Pompadourius> @alphonseisbest Taking a level 1 class sounds like it could be a good idea, yeah.
[3:13:57] <%Metballs> Cape Westwind is a meme
[3:13:57] <%Dwarven_Gaming> ???
[3:13:57] <KatabolicRage> I mean, the first step of this relic was piss easy
[3:13:59] <+Greywyn00> CAPE WESTWIND UNREAL WHEN
[3:14:01] <SolsticeZro> cape westwind LUL
[3:14:03] <%Metballs> You'd spam it for light
[3:14:04] <%Dwarven_Gaming> whyy would it
[3:14:08] <KatabolicRage> so everyones suspicious about the next step
[3:14:09] <GingerSen> HOLY HEK THIS IS LONG
[3:14:11] <CSeriesJTYPE> good, im glad they do, because gatekeeping relics behind shit like eureka was already ridiculous
[3:14:12] <%Dwarven_Gaming> OHH
[3:14:17] <%Pompadourius> Oh god. I don't need more things to give me poetics, I already barely know what to do with them. Please. LUL
[3:14:21] <SolsticeZro> that ol' bungalow
[3:14:24] <GrandmasterBFunk> I'm guessing you can spam westwind for poetics
[3:14:30] <%SleepyMaribo> no more gatekeeping relics
[3:14:32] <CSeriesJTYPE> relics are already pretty much just cosmetic
[3:14:33] <%GalacticaPhanto> !uptime
[3:14:34] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 14m.
[3:14:43] <+HelloImTom08> westwind is just a meme guys
[3:14:56] <%Pompadourius> Westwind Ultimate when?
[3:15:17] <%Pompadourius> 5.3 seems like it'll be worth the wait honestly. LOT of content to be done here.
[3:15:18] <+Greywyn00> they had 3 extra months to make it shine
[3:15:19] <%Pompadourius> I'm impressed.
[3:15:20] <ttc_lover> What’s he doing with his hand
[3:15:26] <SolsticeZro> Eureka weapon was BiS for Final Omega, so I guess this one will also be BiS for final tier with similar super stats like 600 crit or some shit
[3:15:29] <%Daniel_Is_I> How long after 5.3 is it gonna be before 5.35?
[3:15:34] <%Dwarven_Gaming> its not til .5, so a few more months
[3:15:36] <Tucker0603> this patch gives me the Bigus Dickus
[3:15:41] <+r_Foeburden87> is puppet Bunker Yorha part 2 ?
[3:15:44] <ManfredA> prolly a month and a half
[3:15:44] <+alphonseisbest> well it is a major update
[3:15:50] <%Pompadourius> Yeah, that's fair.
[3:16:04] <%Pompadourius> I was about to say "really? September?" then realized it's almost the end of July right now... god, time is flying.
[3:16:06] <TioXyco> @r_Foeburden87 yeah, the bunker is NieR Alliance part 2
[3:16:12] <ManfredA> early October is my bet
[3:16:33] <tactician0> I only have the hw expansion I have a long ways to go :c
[3:16:51] <%Pompadourius> This new southern front thing sounds really cozy once you get into the rhythm.
[3:16:52] <+HelloImTom08> this is looking to be a really good patch
[3:16:53] <%Pompadourius> I like it.
[3:16:55] <%Ciglossonjr> I want to see some fucking stupid boss comps
[3:17:00] <%Daniel_Is_I> Fight a 24-man boss, don't get hit, do a 1v1, get nervous as everyone watches you get shitrocked
[3:17:00] <%SomeSageAdvice> time flies by after HW so no worries @tactician0
[3:17:05] <+r_Foeburden87> @TioXyco ahh thx. looks like i only missed 5.2 then
[3:17:11] <%Ciglossonjr> Like a 48 man but it's all White mages
[3:17:18] <%Pompadourius> YO THAT MOUNT
[3:17:19] <DirtyMiser> gonna do story and then live in new eureka I guess

[3:17:37] <boydaussen> LUL
[3:17:39] <tubit> To infinity and beyond!
[3:17:40] <%Daniel_Is_I> This place is a warfront alright
[3:17:40] <+TombstoneTTromboners> TRENCH WARFARE
[3:17:42] <snowcastleframe> looks like something from ds2
[3:17:44] <+the22cstomp> it has very serious WW1 vibes
[3:17:45] <%Metballs> Welcome to active warzones
[3:17:47] <JulianLynx> Well duh, it's a goddamn battlefield.
[3:17:47] <SolsticeZro> I mean... it is a BATTLEFIELD
[3:17:47] <+HelloImTom08> its war pat
[3:17:48] <ManfredA> ot
[3:17:48] <%Pompadourius> I like its gloom honestly. It's a WW1 trench battlefield.
[3:17:48] <%thegreenbenis> What the fuck is this ww1 shit?
[3:17:49] <%SGrim> I can dig actively hideous
[3:17:49] <Psyramics> its a warzone
[3:17:50] <aeonicvector> Yeah, WW1
[3:17:50] <GingerSen> In a good way orrrrrrr?
[3:17:51] <ManfredA> it's a warzone
[3:17:52] <Tucker0603> it's a FUCK WAR
[3:17:54] <%Rumbutt> It's fucking WW1 style warzone yeah
[3:17:54] <zecht89> Well, it is a warzone
[3:17:54] <+Ilpala> literal trenches
[3:17:56] <%toastybites> reminds me of the future in Chrono Trigger
[3:17:57] <Arnschen> Big War
[3:17:57] <+LailahQueenx> they had to balance il mheg
[3:17:58] <+masked_hero_lucky> It's a battlefield, Pat
[3:17:59] <+Pars_Librum> It's like a warfront should be ugly or something
[3:17:59] <tactician0> ah the trenches
[3:18:00] <+Neoripo> WW1
[3:18:01] <%Ebony_Crowe> That's War, Pat.
[3:18:01] <ConBruhh> yeah it looks horrinle
[3:18:01] <%RedKnightVI> WWI trenches and shit
[3:18:03] <%miabyte> these ww1 trenches tho
[3:18:04] <%Daniel_Is_I> This is what the fuckin Stormblood resistance areas should have looked like
[3:18:06] <%GalacticaPhanto> FFXIV Modern Warfare
[3:18:06] <hyphano> VERDUN
[3:18:06] <%SleepyMaribo> @PatStaresAt it reminds me of that poison windwill area in DS2.
[3:18:07] <dauver> WW1 trenches lets go
[3:18:09] <+the22cstomp> POOP LAKE
[3:18:09] <+r_Foeburden87> Where is this
[3:18:10] <+Greywyn00> I respect it, but I hate it
[3:18:14] <+TombstoneTTromboners> YOSHI-P YOU GOTTA JUMP INTO THE TRENCHES
[3:18:16] <TioXyco> really big
[3:18:17] <olaksi> What era of war would it really be with black magic and laser tanks?
[3:18:20] <%Ciglossonjr> It looks like the Wilderness from RUnescape
[3:18:20] <+smevvster> Every zone that has to do with Garlemald is a fucking brown and grey shitsmear, and if it's going to be like this moving towards Garlemald in future content, I'm going to be so frustrated.
[3:18:25] <+HelloImTom08> probally big as a eureka zone
[3:18:25] <Jontman42> what good even are trenches when you have magic
[3:18:26] <aeonicvector> prob Eureka sized yeah
[3:18:37] <SolsticeZro> it's probably as big as Pyros
[3:18:42] <+wjones0415> holy shit this place looks like ww1!
[3:18:44] <Mawarup> While it makes sense within the context of the world, I don't like it
[3:18:45] <ManfredA> @Jontman42 Garleans don't have those
[3:18:47] <%Daniel_Is_I> Are the aetherytes gonna be rank-gated?
[3:18:49] <ManfredA> they have guns and tanks
[3:18:50] <Tucker0603> fucking big then
[3:18:52] <ManfredA> well, mechs
[3:18:56] <%SGrim> @olaksi if Hitler's bet on Occult magic had actually worked, then WWII.
[3:19:07] <%Pompadourius> Hot take: I prefer how this area looks to Eureka still.
[3:19:15] <%GalacticaPhanto> I'm guessing they'll be digging into FF6 stuff more since Garlemald looks like the snowy areas a lot more
[3:19:20] <xbb1024> hello! what am i looking at?
[3:19:28] <xbb1024> oh, ok
[3:19:30] <%LaughingCatt> probably that fortress
[3:19:31] <SolsticeZro> if they Eureka the relic weapon areas again, then I guess this is only the first area and they add more later on
[3:19:31] <%Daniel_Is_I> Baldesion Arsenal 2.0 psaPorgmo
[3:19:32] <Tucker0603> NANI DA FUQ?!?

[3:20:02] <guitarsamo17> From where is that robot mount?
[3:20:02] <+r_Foeburden87> Hunt mobs are bets mobs. remind me of FFXI NM mdays

[3:28:51] <+Rheyr> Pat is becoming one with the couch.
[3:28:52] <CSeriesJTYPE> its a crossover event, its like saying the yokai watch mount is bad

[3:29:20] <ConBruhh> this toy company better have paid a shit ton
[3:29:21] <%miabyte> I like it
[3:29:21] <+doug_famous> The art styles are so at odds with eachother

[3:30:27] <CSeriesJTYPE> like idg why people are like "why do these look so bad" when they're supposed to be based off of yokai watch stuff
[3:30:28] <%SleepyMaribo> that looks like a kingdom hearts weapon
[3:30:28] <RoxMoxie> Eh, I don't mind the rapier.
[3:30:29] <%Daniel_Is_I> Can you dye these weapons?
[3:30:30] <%SGrim> Okay, the chakram still looks fine.

[3:30:39] <%Pompadourius> @Daniel_Is_I Nope
[3:30:40] <Psyramics> these look like the plastic swords I'd get my parents to buy at Disney on Ice shows when I was 6
[3:30:41] <+213372bu> It looked more. like a snowflake in the illustration
[3:30:42] <+MephioTV> Oh they have a dumb face on them...
[3:30:45] <Badpest> bobberShrug
[3:30:46] <%SomeSageAdvice> no @Daniel_Is_I
[3:30:48] <CSeriesJTYPE> if you dont like yokai watch of course you're not gonna like these
[3:30:50] <+smevvster> If the POINT is that they look like shit, then why make that the point
[3:30:50] <SolsticeZro> Better than most of the others this one imo
[3:30:55] <%Th3SmartAlec> ResidentSleeer
[3:30:56] <%Daniel_Is_I> Welp there goes my interest
[3:30:59] <%Reveresao> Is this the update that Pat was talking about for new players to jump in?

[3:31:25] <%Pompadourius> @Reveresao Mhm. 5.3 will be bringing a change to the ARR story to cut out the filler content
[3:31:28] <SolsticeZro> At least the bunny is wearing a fitting colored glam
[3:31:30] <Arnschen> I mean, you have people running around in giant Moogle, Frog, and Pig outfits in-game so plastic looking weapons isn't that out there
[3:31:31] <InXplotch> @Reveresao yes, this patch will trim a chunk of realm reborn's main story quest

[3:35:14] <TioXyco> Bozjan gear
[3:35:15] <%michingmallecho> sipsipElmo
[3:35:17] <+MephioTV> I looked away for a second and thought Pat was taking a huge rip from a vape
[3:35:20] <+MephioTV> also that armor looks nice
[3:35:22] <%AnIcedCoffee> bozjan
[3:35:24] <%heyitsbrian> @Neoripo the anime looking one

[3:35:33] <+Greywyn00> big stylin
[3:35:36] <%Pompadourius> Time to farm some gear.
[3:35:38] <SolsticeZro> show Axe
[3:35:39] <ne0bunny> I hate when they show off gear on lalafels, the tiny race that we cant see details on
[3:35:41] <+Neoripo> so the Potato Kappa
[3:35:43] <ManfredA> it looks like modified GNB AF
[3:35:59] <@Velyndra> Pat you gonna grind to top 12 with me
[3:36:02] <%SleepyMaribo> to bad itson a lala so its shrunk as shit
[3:36:04] <+Greywyn00> I CAN'T SEE SHIT ON YOUR TINY POTATO YOSHI
[3:36:05] <%thegreenbenis> That's a cute minion

[3:36:20] <%zestyArsenic> bake this potato and get rid of it
[3:36:20] <+Greywyn00> oh that's big stylin\
[3:36:21] <Bigbossman91> this is why you shouldn't show gear on a lallafell, you can barely see any details on it
[3:36:24] <+smevvster> I dig the collar
[3:36:25] <%Daniel_Is_I> Very tacticool
[3:36:28] <Monkeyweed21> I wish I could actually see what it looks like on a real person

[3:36:34] <SolsticeZro> show woyeeer
[3:36:36] <Joustar_> all these new sets look amazing
[3:36:40] <Tucker0603> I like the combat coat look
[3:36:41] <%Daniel_Is_I> It's also dyeable
[3:36:48] <iheartmota> Its dyeable
[3:36:52] <%SwdVengeance> IF ONLY I COULD SEE THIS WONDERFUL GEAR ON NOT A MIDGET

[3:37:04] <ManfredA> you can see it fine lmao
[3:37:05] <Monkeyweed21> Is this what Emet-Selch sees when he looks at us?
[3:37:05] <%Pompadourius> I like the war hero look they're going for.
[3:37:06] <MoonKing> i wish tis was being showcased on a regular sized person
[3:37:07] <%Pompadourius> They nailed it.
[3:37:13] <%Daniel_Is_I> WHERE'S THE DRG GEAR

[3:40:06] <DesertPenguin> @SomeSageAdvice. Thanks, that was some sage advice LUL
[3:40:17] <%michingmallecho> I got the dooms extinction factor
[3:40:23] <DesertPenguin> Did Pat go to sleep or stay up all night?
[3:40:26] <snowmanse> My guess is they combine the Halloween event into the make it rain story
[3:40:26] <Klefth> Did they say anything about 5.4?
[3:40:31] <%SomeSageAdvice> np @DesertPenguin also Pat beat you to that joke lol
[3:40:33] <Psyramics> what does the first half of that say?!
[3:40:35] <%Pompadourius> December for 5.4 then?
[3:40:37] <%Sausious> Elmo woke him up
[3:40:38] <TomFrancis_> pat is in limbo right now
[3:40:39] <+Greywyn00> seems like he stayed uo
[3:40:41] <DesertPenguin> I Just got here
[3:40:44] <%Pompadourius> I assume this means December is 5.4.

[3:41:22] <%Th3SmartAlec> ResidentSleeper
[3:41:24] <%StaceMcGate> just call it quit
[3:41:26] <SolsticeZro> looks like the other stream today is cancelled
[3:41:28] <%michingmallecho> The servers are going to be drhgHmm HahaBall
[3:41:28] <+r_Foeburden87> Bring rainmaker hair back
[3:41:29] <+TombstoneTTromboners> pat will never sleep
[3:41:31] <DesertPenguin> Pat, go to sleep
[3:41:31] <%heyitsbrian> then stop streaming!
[3:41:33] <%Pompadourius> @ManfredA Given that that last event goes until late November, I'm gonna assume so, yeah
[3:41:35] <+Greywyn00> I woke up just in time for this so I'm good :)
[3:41:36] <aeonicvector> go take power nap with alarm
[3:41:37] <Klefth> Daaaaamn, December would be pretty rough. I kinda hate this about strictly vertical MMOs
[3:41:39] <Joustar_> yeyeyeye LUL
[3:41:40] <%LadyTheWanderer> yea pat looks very sleepy
[3:41:40] <SolsticeZro> oh yeah today is Blight
[3:41:40] <Reireizei> pat i'm worried :(
[3:41:41] <AnaStationLive> Pat why are you doing this to yourself?
[3:41:42] <CMash2k> why not just push it a bit so you can sleep
[3:41:44] <%Daniel_Is_I> Take a nap, have Paige drag you out of bed
[3:41:44] <DesertPenguin> You need to take care of your body
[3:41:45] <%SGrim> Time for MAXIMUM COFFEE
[3:41:46] <%SpcOpsBear> No Halloween event confirmed.
[3:41:46] <Klefth> It's like "just quit til the next content patch"
[3:41:46] <Busterinabox> Imagine not sleeping for something that gets explained in one forum post in the afternoon. KEK
[3:41:47] <+213372bu> Just drink your toxic red liquids
[3:41:49] <%michingmallecho> Can't stop. Got to finish
[3:41:52] <Goodvibes99508> "Its all yokai watch?" "always has been"
[3:41:52] <Joustar_> P O W E R N A P
[3:41:55] <%Typhaeon> Just inject pure caffeine into your veins
[3:41:55] <%michingmallecho> No quitters here
[3:42:02] <%SpcOpsBear> Some parts of it will be part of the Make It Rain event instead.
[3:42:05] <Floofiie> COFFEE
[3:42:08] <Joustar_> Pat CONSOOM
[3:42:13] <%ToneBacas> was it worth it?
[3:42:14] <%LadyTheWanderer> surprised he isn't just laying down on the couch to watch this
[3:42:16] <%Sausious> great Pat now I'M yawning
[3:42:17] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> B O S S C O F F E E
[3:42:18] <DesertPenguin> @PatStaresAt Caffeine is an unhealthy way to stay awake for long periods of time. Take a nap and let Paige play Dark Souls 2 with Plague
[3:42:22] <%SpcOpsBear> when the cold brew hits
[3:42:30] <aeonicvector> ty for stream, your response to the not yokai stuff was good to see coming from a relativley new nonsprout
[3:42:32] <%zestyArsenic> just watch the trailer again and get hyped that you get to pilot a gundam. get in the fucking robot, warrior of light.
[3:42:38] <SolsticeZro> They wasted too much time with shit between actually showing stuff
[3:42:39] <+r_Foeburden87> Welp i TTHOUGHT i was gonna dip into PSO2. but naww
[3:42:39] <+alphonseisbest> @PatStaresAt What are u streaming with Plague?13? LUL
[3:42:39] <DesertPenguin> F for Pat's consciousness
[3:42:44] <xWanderingFlame> Everything is unhealthy. Shut up
[3:42:56] <guitarsamo17> no halloween event?
[3:42:58] <%Pompadourius> August until December for the Yo-kai Watch then... no excuse for anyone who's even kinda interested to not get it done then. LUL
[3:43:11] <%RedKnightVI> eh
[3:43:12] <psimon_> lies and truth
[3:43:14] <DesertPenguin> @xWanderingFlame Not really. Pat has a history of bad sleeping patterns and anyone who's been here for awhile knows it
[3:43:14] <Psyramics> Halloween in December!
[3:43:15] <%Stonebeard> halloween yokai
[3:43:15] <Muffinmastr> Pat, random question, do you like smoothies?
[3:43:17] <DesertPenguin> and tries to help him

[3:43:49] <Monkeyweed21> why are we still here
[3:44:00] <+grixsis_> just to suffer?
[3:44:00] <%GalacticaPhanto> Viera not wearing helmets is the wildest thing
[3:44:02] <%SomeSageAdvice> @213372bu they said in an interview that they will probably never fix that issue
[3:44:02] <%Daniel_Is_I> Gold Saucer music SourPls
[3:44:04] <%LadyTheWanderer> squish the bunny ears
[3:44:21] <+213372bu> @SomeSageAdvice oooof, that sucks
[3:44:22] <%Daniel_Is_I> I just saw Pat hollow out A LITTLE BIT MORE
[3:44:27] <%Pompadourius> Fan Festival means new expansion trailer, right?
[3:44:30] <%SpcOpsBear> prepare for disappointment
[3:44:31] <DesertPenguin> Hai

[3:44:39] <%Pompadourius> (It won't)
[3:44:43] <+BeefMcCat> ! PAT AT RISK !
[3:44:47] <+MephioTV> @SomeSageAdvice They also said New Game + would never be a thing
[3:44:50] <%GalacticaPhanto> Honestly I was kind of hoping for a virtual fanfest
[3:44:56] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> yoshi looks 20 years older than he is
[3:45:06] <%Pompadourius> Actually, when do expansion trailers usually come out? Is it on the .5 patch usually or no?
[3:45:11] <DesertPenguin> Onegaishimaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaas

[3:45:20] <DGZenos> i remember FF14 being fun, but after i let my sub laps, i deleted the program from my computer. when i tried to DL it again, it said it would take 296hours. so i gave up on it
[3:45:28] <DesertPenguin> Suimin
[3:45:29] <%terminallyCapriciousz> @Big_Bang_Blitz_ you would too if you didn't sleep for 6 years
[3:45:30] <+alphonseisbest> COME ON PAT U GOT THIS!!!
[3:45:34] <+213372bu> Mega64's "virtual con replacement" was pretty amazing, it was like 5-6 hours of pure energy
[3:45:36] <Isord> Sleepy boy
[3:45:45] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> I havent slept for 20 lol
[3:45:45] <+213372bu> This one just seems like theyre stretching a normal live letter

[3:57:22] <TomFrancis_> what if he passes out on the toilet
[3:57:23] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 57m.
[3:57:24] <+mister_rogers> any big announcements yet?
[3:57:25] <%ToneBacas> @SGrim in some streams it's questionable whether they're even brain-dead or not, so i'm sure it's fine if Pat streams his sleepy time
[3:57:25] <+SilentTrinity> psaBlep NotLikeThis BibleThump
[3:57:26] <%Th3SmartAlec> F
[3:57:28] <%Gondab> He finally did it, he crapped his pants.

[3:57:42] <DesertPenguin> If he just did this on a regular basis he'd be okay
[3:57:59] <+NitronStreams> the relief of no pissing himself has caused pat to piss himself
[3:58:06] <%ToneBacas> Pat will be back in greater numbers
