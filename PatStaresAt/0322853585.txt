[0:09:01] <ThePowerOfRa420> Crazy Talk ACTIVATE
[0:09:02] <Hawkbone_> Call of Duty was always good, its only problem was too many games coming out, and too little innovation. Blops 4 actually seems to have changed things up quite a bit though.

[0:15:47] <%TaifuDragon> gobolin
[0:15:48] <%SuperCasualBoom> Kinda tired of Attack on Titan...
[0:15:48] <%Solidnick18> goblin slayer was alright
[0:15:48] <eco419> Hi pat :) how are you doing?
[0:15:49] <+Sinister_Aglet> you mean the doomguy anime
[0:15:50] <ThePowerOfRa420> NOOOO
[0:15:52] <+FadingEmber> I honestly don't understand why people like AoT
[0:15:52] <derap41> Gobling raper more like
[0:15:54] <+in_spaaace> Goblin Rape
[0:15:54] <Tucker0603> IT'S TRASH
[0:15:55] <Mr_Strut> The rape is only for the first few episodes.
[0:15:56] <+GuttyGoop> Goblin slayer is pretty good
[0:15:58] <@thenefftw> YEAH
[0:15:58] <TheBlankAce> Goblin Slayer just has a very rough start to sell
[0:15:58] <chris_the_wiz_> YES
[0:15:58] <+jaggiesama> Hey bitch whens the shitstorm #Gingerstroke
[0:15:58] <$konekoryugamine> THAT ANIME IS THE SHIT
[0:15:59] <fmc009> Goblin Slayer is cool. To bad anime reviewers are not adults about it
[0:16:00] <+chiluzza> GOBLIN SLAYER IS GOOD its about a genocidal fuck who kills everything and doesnt afraid of anything
[0:16:00] <%PipIV> I kinda like it
[0:16:02] <KillerKaje> it's berserk but goblin
[0:16:02] <IntrepidEye> Goblin Slayer is ok.
[0:16:02] <+chiluzza> would recommend
[0:16:02] <+Jordan_z123> YEYEYEYEYE

[0:16:07] <%Dingus_Tickler> JoJo Part 5 is the only shit I'm gonna watch right now. And a tiny side of Season 3 MHA
[0:16:08] <ThDark> Goblin Slayer is fine, if you like Berserk nothing in Goblin Slayer should shock you
[0:16:09] <Asian_Turtle_> honda san is good shit
[0:16:10] <%TaifuDragon> Are you watching Attack on Titan?
[0:16:10] <FenixSeraph> Honda-san best boy
[0:16:12] <%SuperCasualBoom> @fadingember It’s The Walking Dead with giant people.
[0:16:14] <$TheSmerdis> That intro music is SO good
[0:16:16] <xeros720> skeleton anime takes precedence, it's true
[0:16:17] <ThePowerOfRa420> Its just SAO rape again
[0:16:17] <%topendbuzz> BUT ZOMBIELAND THO
[0:16:18] <+elsievoid> Globin Slayer is really good, first episode tone doens't respresent the rest of the show much

[0:36:20] <zal_silverfang> @AngriestPat well, that puts a bit less concern in me then Pat. cause i mean, we use to joke about you having a Stand to only have it to literally happen. so, joking about a stoke kinda brings that same concern every time. glad you are fine
[0:36:21] <MasterDecoder> @leinadtonu Rabid
[0:36:21] <Mr_Strut> Maybe Pat just needs to get high.

[0:54:35] <thelonechris> Futuristic triangle bullets
[0:54:39] <$birdfella> It must be fun to play a Battle Royal that's fun to control.

[0:55:20] <aiyobro> seriously they' about to get sued
[0:55:21] <$konekoryugamine> But if you wanna find it, look on mangagogo
[0:55:22] <%jediwatchman11> what's more powerful, Kraut Space Magic bullets or Triange bullets
[0:55:23] <%PipIV> *"safer"
[0:55:27] <AlasterAngelo> so is this just pubg with the cod name
[0:55:30] <jobbedbone> SPIRAL
[0:55:33] <Revawo> TAKE THE BIKE
[0:55:34] <+ClicheHiei> So can anyone explain why this BR is better than other alternative BR
[0:55:37] <Prism_Wing> It's a nice house. I'd live there.
[0:55:40] <dekkitout> so whats the plan next year with this game?
[0:55:40] <Coystick> Can you co-op in this PUBG mode?
[0:55:41] <+Shin_Kiryu> Priority #1 is to find ARMOR, PAt
[0:55:43] <Hawkbone_> @AlasterAngelo Its PUBG but much better and not completely broken
[0:55:43] <%PipIV> @alasterangelo yup. but kinda better
[0:55:48] <Revawo> missed a perfectly fine dirt bike there
[0:55:49] <%Remery_> Hustle, Fatass
[0:55:53] <Revawo> aw
[0:55:53] <$konekoryugamine> No, Priority Number one is to NO FUCKING BITE IT
[0:55:54] <AlasterAngelo> getting mixed signals here

[0:55:58] <+darkmithrionx> Too much noise
[0:55:59] <DSD24> @ClicheHiei I am assuming its because it runs well and isn't filled with hackers
[0:55:59] <%PipIV> atv. missed.
[0:56:00] <The_Sorrow_> 😡

[0:56:06] <Revawo> you can drive by all the haters
[0:56:06] <%ssjklyco> @ClicheHiei I has less bugs and has Call of Duty as it's name.
[0:56:07] <%PipIV> 4-wheeler
[0:56:10] <+LastHazzerd> PUBG isn't gonna sue Activision
[0:56:14] <+G_Thunders> Looks prettier than PUBG, that’s for sure
[0:56:17] <$TheNeedlesD> 24 left
[0:56:17] <+Shin_Kiryu> @konekoryugamine That to
[0:56:18] <$konekoryugamine> Oh my god IF TEHRE IS A CAR THEN YOU CAN DRIVE IT DAMN IT
[0:56:20] <knomad2b> death everywhere
[0:56:21] <zal_silverfang> @AlasterAngelo this is more the Pubg/battle royal game being where it belongs. as a side game mode and not an entire game in it of itself
[0:56:24] <%GoogleyGareth> apatCrazyhead
[0:56:26] <+ClicheHiei> @TheNeedlesD @DSD24 @ssjklyco Far enough
[0:56:29] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> this looks great in all honesty
[0:56:30] <Parapattern> Whips out a pistol while on the bike and shoots a guy in the head without slowing down
[0:56:32] <+ClicheHiei> Fair*
[0:56:35] <+Rookie_Balboa> @konekoryugamine >not a hijikataxgintoki doujin DansGame
[0:56:35] <$konekoryugamine> GAS STATION EQUALS CAR
[0:56:38] <%Remery_> yes always scavenge for food you dirty rabbit :)
[0:56:42] <reiju_22> looks much better than pubg
[0:56:44] <%SuperCasualBoom> Battlegrounds a good name for a game. But PlayerUnknown sounds so generic
[0:56:44] <%PipIV> Pat "tacticool" Boivin
[0:56:46] <%President_Miyazaki> Guys, he knows you can drive. He literally just said he isn't going to because it's a death trap to do so.
[0:56:47] <aiyobro> dude i thought it'd be like constant search and destroy on a big island not 1 man survival shit
[0:56:50] <$birdfella> wasnt there another floor?
[0:56:51] <Hawkbone_> @LastHazzerd You say that, but they sued Epic, who owns the engine PUBG runs on and fucking murdered Too Human for attempting to sue them
[0:56:52] <Corporate_Redeemer> TRYCK
[0:56:56] <+darkmithrionx> Close
[0:56:57] <pulppedro> @zal_silverfang good point...but didn't Fortnite BR start as a side game mode?
[0:56:57] <+Griffin1171> target on your bum
[0:56:59] <$konekoryugamine> @Rookie_Balboa It's that tentacle one he was talking about in Honda-san.
[0:57:00] <$DesertPenguin09> Any plan to play Battlefield V as well?
[0:57:01] <eco419> Yet
[0:57:02] <%Keyd00d> it's just literally pubg
[0:57:03] <Kyndey_B> Weon pc?
[0:57:08] <$DesertPenguin09> It's exactly the same
[0:57:08] <+darkmithrionx> Big sniper
[0:57:08] <OwlLightningMage> I want a BR game with giant mechs
[0:57:08] <%Keyd00d> without cheaters
[0:57:08] <sileo_patronus> @konekoryugamine car equals massive moving target where everyone knows where to shoot to hit the driver
[0:57:09] <+GN93> pubg is way better
[0:57:10] <+Jimboq> pubg with cod shooting and movement
[0:57:10] <thelonechris> "Good"
[0:57:10] <+Skatedeandre> ive never seen the name player uknown before
[0:57:15] <+AmaniIsYourBoss> It's PUBG with money
[0:57:16] <%Dmorktry> Battlefield V LUL
[0:57:16] <cerberuscarmine> bf5 is totally screwed
[0:57:16] <Newtling> Hey pat, have you tried a pair of corsair hs50s? I use them for streaming and they're on par with my bose quiet comfort 35s
[0:57:18] <$konekoryugamine> @sileo_patronus Got me tehre
[0:57:18] <%KaizenChaos> Pubg with money
[0:57:19] <Pixelated_Cloud> a playable pubg
[0:57:19] <+LastHazzerd> @Hawkbone_ they sued epic BECAUSE they own the engine PUBG runs on
[0:57:20] <McCune> pubg with a budget
[0:57:20] <+zalonar> PUBG is now redundant
[0:57:20] <%Keyd00d> BFV LUL
[0:57:20] <%jediwatchman11> I'm sad BLOPS4 doesn't have campaign, because I loved the Blops 1 and 2 campaigns a lot
[0:57:22] <cureneckbeard> A good PUBG? You mean Fortnite
[0:57:22] <%NovaKnightmare> HAHAHA nah
[0:57:22] <+khalcipher> I just wish it was cheaper tho
[0:57:24] <%aishman> So worth the 60 then?
[0:57:28] <+GreenBrains_> I'm waiting to see if they add bullshit minibuys
[0:57:29] <+enterprise900> BFV looks terrible
[0:57:33] <+CatYamHD> pubg on a AAA Budget
[0:57:33] <+Rookie_Balboa> I know I'm just saying if its not hijigin why fuckin bother
[0:57:33] <dekkitout> its the jotaro to pubg's kakyoin
[0:57:33] <Kyndey_B> Are the weapons hitscan?
[0:57:35] <$DesertPenguin09> Shit meaning battle royale or gameplay in general?
[0:57:36] <knomad2b> iv'e always been more into bf but 5 looks meh
[0:57:37] <lloyddboy> DE PLANE! DE PLANE!
[0:57:37] <AFlyingTaco1> Nah the BFV Beta was not great
[0:57:37] <$birdfella> I hope this game stays really popular. I hate Fortnight but I like the Idea.
[0:57:37] <%PipIV> I liked playing the beta
[0:57:38] <zamzoph> Fantasy WW2 LUL
[0:57:39] <+Venhammer> BFV looks terrible so far
[0:57:41] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> lol
[0:57:41] <+Shaggnar> They are more experienced with larger maps so maybe?
[0:57:44] <+Grayhammatter> welp
[0:57:45] <%ssjklyco> Got a bit of cel shading as well, so it doesn't look like low quality textures
[0:57:45] <Corporate_Redeemer> Zombies for the spoopy season?
[0:57:45] <%GoogleyGareth> Pretty far away tho
[0:57:47] <pakuman> crazy talk
[0:57:48] <%SuperCasualBoom> Fucknite is a shitstorm
[0:57:49] <DSD24> Shooting guns in fortnite isn't fun to me
[0:57:50] <pulppedro> I love how CoD is more hype this year than Battlefield
[0:57:51] <ragasquid> where is paige
[0:57:55] <awsomesaucekirby> cheer232 here's some bits for the _xX_MLG PRO 420 NOSCOPE_Xx_
[0:57:58] <Mr_Strut> Time to be a big coward
[0:58:02] <%Jpdodds> someone is here
[0:58:04] <aiyobro> bf1 sucked, it had automatic weapons in the great war, so stupid
[0:58:04] <$konekoryugamine> No broken windows, door open, watch out
[0:58:05] <$DesertPenguin09> I'm a battlefield guy and hate codblopz but haven't been blown away either. BF1 is still great
[0:58:05] <%jediwatchman11> Fortnite is literally too hard for me. It's the first game that made me realize I'm old
[0:58:07] <+DarkShadow124> BFV beta was ok
[0:58:13] <%Remery_> nice bedroom :)
[0:58:13] <%PipIV> oh how the times are-a-changing
[0:58:15] <$birdfella> @ragasquid Probably traveling for her job or something
[0:58:18] <+Silentman0> i don't understand why people think that playing battle royale games cowardly is fun
[0:58:20] <+Hamblasto> What are the odds of Pat getting stream sniped?
[0:58:22] <OkamiDude15> paige is either asleep or stuffing her face with mc donalds off screen
[0:58:27] <Coystick> Not enough cyborg waifus
[0:58:27] <knomad2b> pat was made to play br. backing down is the name of the game
[0:58:30] <Hawkbone_> @LastHazzerd No they didn't, they sued them because they thought they were ripping off PUBG. Even then though, its still dumb to sue the ones who own your engine, Too Human has all of its copies recalled and destroyed because SK sued Epic
[0:58:36] <+tigerfang86> Yo pat how's this Battle Royale variant, I hope it's Better PUBG
[0:58:37] <%Keyd00d> ratatat
[0:58:37] <AlasterAngelo> is that a Ford Fiesta
[0:58:38] <%PipIV> @silentman0 ginger strokes for different folks

[0:58:44] <%happyface699> In what world does cod win against battlefield is what I thought then I saw battlefield 5
[0:58:44] <AFlyingTaco1> I just don't understand the appeal of this game mode over the regular multiplayer stuff
[0:58:44] <$GohanEgret> big quiet
[0:58:44] <%topendbuzz> top 20
[0:58:44] <Parapattern> 10000% gonna get killed by sniper
[0:58:47] <%Solidnick18> close
[0:58:48] <jobbedbone> DESPACITO CRAB
[0:58:48] <$ooblagis> I don't understand why people think playing Battle Royal is fun period
[0:58:48] <zal_silverfang> @pulppedro pretty much i think. probably abandoned what that game was going to be cause i dont hear anything about fortnite proper which is sad cause it looked promising when it first started out
[0:58:49] <%oKentucky> teenSUP admiralDong
[0:58:52] <RichAnvils> I don't want him to get stream sniped, I want him to get stream honked
[0:58:56] <$DesertPenguin09> I may get this just for the battle royale if it's fun. At least it will be well populated for awhile and run smoothly. Not a PC guy either so best bet for good realistic royake
[0:58:57] <%Keyd00d> these open doors
[0:58:58] <+zeiss_schreiber> It's a better PUBG so far
[0:58:59] <%deviljhojho94> pat you have to kill them
[0:59:01] <%deviljhojho94> Kill them all
[0:59:01] <Vorsun> Lock yourself in the bathroom
[0:59:02] <+tigerfang86> Nice
[0:59:03] <+Jimboq> what's your strategy pat? strength or cowardice
[0:59:03] <%PipIV> shhh, we hunting shitheads
[0:59:06] <+SoarFlyer> not even checking corners
[0:59:11] <+tigerfang86> DONT COWARD OUT PAT
[0:59:11] <+Taydoinwork182> went out the window
[0:59:12] <+tigerfang86> DONT DO IT
[0:59:12] <$DesertPenguin09> Don't kill just hide until they have to find yoy
[0:59:13] <WoRabbit> just had a red bull ad and it's a bit too fitting
[0:59:13] <$birdfella> This game looks great for such a large map
[0:59:13] <zamzoph> wow, Pat plays super coward
[0:59:14] <aiyobro> Remember no russian
[0:59:14] <pulppedro> @zal_silverfang apparently Save the World is still in paid early access?
[0:59:15] <%Keyd00d> VERY close
[0:59:15] <ragasquid> elo better
[0:59:15] <$GohanEgret> I wish Paige was here to scare the shit out of Pat when he's focused

[0:59:25] <DSD24> Check those corners...
[0:59:26] <%deviljhojho94> He HATES it
[0:59:27] <$DesertPenguin09> Coward is smart in war. There's no fair or unfair
[0:59:28] <+Grayhammatter> that was some super chunky fire
[0:59:29] <%NovaKnightmare> If he gets into top 15, he did well enough for his first game
[0:59:33] <+tigerfang86> Pat's Likes: Not Getting Shot
[0:59:33] <zal_silverfang> @pulp HAHAHA of fucking course it is
[0:59:34] <+Griffin1171> I always wanted to get into Battlefield, but by the time I had heard about the series, it was about how terrible the recent entries were
[0:59:42] <pulppedro> @zal_silverfang but yeah I would not be surprised if that original mode got cancelled cuz of BR
[0:59:42] <%jediwatchman11> that Destiny-ass inventory screen
[0:59:46] <+TheBigO75> No Pat LOVES being shot
[0:59:47] <+jayfigga> That icr is the best gun in the game
[0:59:47] <+AmaniIsYourBoss> Getting shot is NOT ash money, says Pat.
[0:59:48] <AFlyingTaco1> I hope they put a Conquest game mode into this game though. That would be fucking sick.
[0:59:49] <emoonimoo> Be vewy, vewy quiet...
[0:59:50] <$konekoryugamine> Believe me when I say I have read FAR WORSE than Gintoki being butt-fucked by an alien tentacle beast.

[1:01:07] <awsomesaucekirby> cheer232 y'know what a good trick to pull on people who supercharge their audio to get an audio would be? Have the game detect these settings and replace the occasional noise with a loud-ass jump scare
[1:01:07] <+ArchimerDreatect> oh man they even give you some profound 'war is hell' quote followed by wubwub level ups, oh christ i do not miss this series! LUL
[1:01:08] <zal_silverfang> @pulppedro honestly it feels like it was going to be a run of the mill survival game cause it didnt appear to have much early game direction but then had gears shifted. oh well so sad. sad to see indies chasing trends like the games industry does and fails at
[1:01:09] <Nexoosen> CoD is fast, dont be afraid to run and gun

[1:01:17] <%ToxInjection> As an EDM fan, I can appreciate BLOPS4 curving into dubstep for no discernible reason
[1:01:17] <+Foobe> pretty sure the ironsights blocked your sight on the target that last go around.
[1:01:17] <AFlyingTaco1> So do people enjoy this mode because it's more laid-back and casual?

Still young, talented, beautiful when I saw her music set. Afterward, she did autographs, I was the last one in line. Was gonna take a picture with her and my phone died. Told security to get her water and it was me and her. She peek around, grab my head and had me motorboat her for 10 sec to make up for no pic. Didn’t expect that from her, signed my vinyl, and got a hi-5 from her.

[1:20:59] <AFlyingTaco1> They aren't live yet though
[1:21:04] <awsomesaucekirby> cheer232 so pat, what do you think of the part 5 op? I thought it was bland end generic at first, but it grew on me like a bad rash after the 5th listen. The full version is leagues better, and coda's cry screaming haunts me now
[1:21:08] <%Afterman_> have paige play soma?

[1:21:26] <+darkmithrionx> YEP, it's nice
[1:21:27] <%happyface699> Re 6
[1:21:28] <alcors_wisdom> @ravencloak13 haptic feedback stick basically a controller stick with variable inputs
[1:21:28] <$wolfofsound> it's no rape horse
[1:21:29] <%goose_attack_almanac> Goes hard in the first episode
[1:21:30] <%deviljhojho94> Its the implcation
[1:21:31] <xeros720> pat is just a scatman
[1:21:32] <%PipIV> Monster House on the ps2?
[1:21:33] <OkamiDude15> its super not woopsWeird
[1:21:33] <nzrai> it's not that bad
[1:21:34] <%Keyd00d> it's flavor of the month
[1:21:34] <knomad2b> not nearly as bad!
[1:21:35] <GoldeNOVA> Not even half of a Berserk
[1:21:37] <$wolfofsound> it's a bit more like the troll scene
[1:21:38] <%CyborgAV> It's NOT EVEN CLOSE to rape horse
[1:21:41] <%deviljhojho94> Goblin slayer is just FOTM
[1:21:43] <ChloeFleurage> goblin slayer is just berserk lite
[1:21:43] <%Remery_> Not hard enough you can barely see anything!
[1:21:43] <+NiktenKing> It's like diet Berserk
[1:21:43] <+Yeajow> Its only to set the tone
[1:21:44] <ThDark> Doesn't really go that hard, honestly
[1:21:45] <skeletonknifefight> mw3 is not even close to the best
[1:21:45] <%SuperCasualBoom> Japan with their rapey animal
[1:21:49] <zal_silverfang> @deviljhojho94 implicated horse penis
[1:21:50] <alcors_wisdom> talking about that goblin love
[1:21:50] <cerberuscarmine> BLACK OPS 1 WAS BEST
[1:21:51] <dekkitout> how super hard? castle super hard, superhard?
[1:21:51] <+Arkfyre> Yeah but the second episode has Cow Girl
[1:21:52] <%goose_attack_almanac> Ah

[1:21:53] <AFlyingTaco1> What is so bad about Goblin Slayer exactly? Like what is everyone talking about
[1:21:54] <Darkwraith_Varik> let a real gamer play

[1:24:55] <Darkwraith_Varik> you know it
[1:24:56] <Mr_Strut> I've narrowed down his location to somewhere in Canada.

[1:26:32] <+whiskywolfe> God this game has anti-charm. Anti-character.
[1:26:33] <ravencloak13> @garbagenirvana Cause no weapons, very small inclosed space and too much crazy movement in the heli’s would cause it to drop out the sky.
[1:26:39] <zal_silverfang> look at pat trying to give us video game advice for a shit game none of us will every play. let us laugh at the baby man

Anyway 2nd story, last year went to concert for a famous rap group from the 90s, bone thugs n harmony. Was close to the stage and one of them stage dives to crowd surf and landed back first and his ass land exactly on top of my head hard. I got woozy, and had a headache for the rest of the night, still a great concert.Thank goodness I loved their music growing up. 😬

[2:56:26] <%Keyd00d> why
[2:56:27] <Bouldus> @AlasterAngelo which isnt a bad thing, but i feel they would hae been better served making something aimed at the people already engaged with their game

[2:57:57] <%deviljhojho94> frustration is getting bigger, bang bang bang pull my ginger trigger
[2:57:58] <tank7013> @AngriestPat The fix should be on the mods page
[2:57:59] <+Virokwet> i will say as a ps4 player, part of my joys of watching peeps play this game on stream is hearing the modded music
[2:58:01] <AirlineFood74> Square enix broke the music overhaul mod
[2:58:02] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> Winner-hype to Dragon-Midi to FIX-IT
[2:58:02] <+Arsimckhoi> will you play valkyria chronicles 4?
[2:58:03] <%Bane_Kaikyo> do apatBig thonk
[2:58:09] <zaptar13> Just fix it. Defeat that composer!
[2:58:15] <+Haruharuharuko> oo they put out a patch that bnroke the mod this week theres a patched exe file that you just paste over the main exe
[2:58:15] <Darlington_the_Deceiver> Let Peepee fix it
[2:58:23] <TheyCallMeVawn> The guide on steam tells you how to fix it
[2:58:23] <Coystick> Defeat composer racism
[2:58:32] <+Gorgen> whats the deal with the music?
[2:58:34] <+Virokwet> but its whatever to me at this point as ive beat the game
[2:58:44] <cerberuscarmine> u.u
[2:58:44] <+blastazoid26> big composer rascism
[2:58:44] <AirlineFood74> Square enix broke the music overhaul mod. The soundtrack is super copyrighted. This is why pat is mad
[2:58:59] <+jkobe34> there is a google drive link
[2:59:01] <alcors_wisdom> if only fixing DQ was as easy as winning a COD match
[2:59:15] <%SolitudeOtM> ***
[2:59:15] <%ViewtifulYoshi> @Gorgen The composer didn't want his music on the international version because... racism, I guess?
[2:59:17] <tank7013> @AngriestPat At the top of the page
[2:59:18] <randomp141> @AngriestPat Turn off messages from anyone but those you know on your PS4! Lest someone sends you a brick code.
[2:59:19] <burkey0307> the steam guide tells you how to fix it
[2:59:25] <+jkobe34> at the top it says !!!!!ATTENTION!!!!! WE ARE AWARE THAT THE MOST RECENT UPDATE TO DQ11 HAS BROKEN OOM. WE HAVE FOUND A TEMPORARY FIX. THIS WILL RESTORE ALL ISSUES WITH THE MOD, BUT WILL SADLY REMOVE SOME OF THE UPDATES IN THE MOST RECENT PATCH. WE ARE WORKING ON AN UPDATE THAT WILL BE COMPATIBLE WITH THE MOST RECENT PATCH; THIS IS ONLY TEMPORARY. DO THIS STEP BEFORE INSTALLING:
[2:59:26] <prettypatties97> "Use it if you have Special K" Like the cereal?
[2:59:29] <Strideral> Time to whip out the Spanish Flea music
[2:59:30] <%kewlmyc> CHECK THE STEAM GUIDE
[2:59:30] <TheBlankAce> It should be at the top of the page
[2:59:31] <+blastazoid26> BIG THONK
[2:59:37] <+BopBeep> notavirus.exe
[2:59:40] <AirlineFood74> LUL
[2:59:42] <tank7013> That's dumb
[2:59:43] <Kaitepaints> Is this how game developers stop people from streaming their games?
[2:59:45] <+Cogito1001> @Gorgen Its copywrite shenanigans. We can hear it now but when this stream is over the portions with the og music will be mute.
[2:59:51] <+DihyDroxy1> The gears they turn.
[3:00:03] <zal_silverfang> @Gorgen compose is an asshole. we have bad version of music cause we arent japanese. composer is apparently racist which is the reason. mods bring much better music back in for all region games
[3:00:07] <+Cogito1001> So if you revisit this stream the last 20mins will have no audio.
[3:00:09] <%OdysseyKnight> Do it!
