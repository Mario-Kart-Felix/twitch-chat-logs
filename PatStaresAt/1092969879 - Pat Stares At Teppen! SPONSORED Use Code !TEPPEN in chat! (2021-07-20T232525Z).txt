[0:00:22] <%neroforte177> we back
[0:00:24] <amonimis> @patstaresat I'd skim the mobile gamd broadcasting help article twitch has...mentions no headsets cuz records game audio via speakers, and also it'll show notifications etc since it's just a basic screen capture
[0:00:25] <%king_wragles> TO BE FAIR: Twitch hates any and all mobile users. Watching streams is ass on mobile for Twitch
[0:00:26] <auraofdawn> YEAHHH CRUST
[0:00:35] <RyuuAoi> Tbf this Pat first time. He's a virgin! Gotta ease it in
[0:00:36] <%NopeBadguy> DID YOU NOT READ IT

[0:01:21] <CptVolkow> !teppen
[0:01:22] <@Moobot> @CptVolkow Hey check out TEPPEN! It's cool! Use this link! https://gat.onelink.me/NitF/patstaresat
[0:01:25] <ExpressNode> AVAILABLE NOW
[0:01:25] <%LegendGHT> I'd rather Pat is clear than the game
[0:01:25] <+Papafleish> Teppen deez nuts haha get pwned
[0:01:26] <%Tman451> that art is cool tho
[0:01:26] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt Probably should've called Woolie for phone stream help
[0:01:36] <%Evil_Emu147> What would you do if Gief and Elmo came to you for help hiding a dead human and requested that you ask no questions and never speak of it again?
[0:01:39] <PanicSwytch> Pat show us ur picture/video gallery
[0:01:42] <+ReallyBigRocks> Turns out phones aren't designed to record sound out of their own fuckin speakers
[0:01:47] <%THATGUY_789> Patented Pat stream right here
[0:01:49] <JonnyJug> Call a big strong man to help you
[0:01:53] <%twistedj3ster> how could you call Woolie if you were using a phone for Teppen?
[0:01:54] <+SgtPepper5e> !TEPPEN
[0:01:54] <@Moobot> @SgtPepper5e Hey check out TEPPEN! It's cool! Use this link! https://gat.onelink.me/NitF/patstaresat
[0:01:56] <ZeludeRose> 2008 darksydephil audio
[0:01:57] <RyuuAoi> Then Woolie could rub that in Pat face FOREVA
[0:01:58] <Mattais88> Would it be half as fun if it wasn't a disaster
[0:01:59] <%NitronStreams> Twitch says point the camera at your tv for best quality
[0:02:03] <%maenos2> son of zangief
[0:02:08] <%Axellogic> See when pat pulls his dick out on stream by accident you can be assured its only his dick
[0:02:11] <%GigaSeifer> I thought you had to stream an hour of something else first?
[0:02:13] <%asgard147> Can't they Pat? You sure? limesSmug
[0:02:14] <+gnoame> They can't talk but they can murder, so the point still stands.
[0:02:14] <%NopeBadguy> Thanks, Ryu
[0:02:15] <gslayer14> kevin?
[0:02:19] <%AzureGale> But I thought you said dogs could talk...?
[0:02:23] <@SoFarFetched> @GigaSeifer they said "nah you're good just stream it now"
[0:02:24] <%twistedj3ster> I don't think they are qualified to handle Pats there tho
[0:02:24] <+trackles_64> mobile advertising

[0:03:08] <%twistedj3ster> why are you asking us? you're the teppen man
[0:03:13] <%LegendGHT> They should really release this on PC
[0:03:13] <ZeludeRose> Ada lookin like shes gonna link the flame
[0:03:16] <%maskofmichael> Is Teppen the Dark Souls of card games?
[0:03:19] <%Tman451> as long as its not jill again

[0:03:40] <+RootVeggie> Why does Megaman have such child bearing hips?
[0:03:40] <%GigaSeifer> Nergigante punching a Ryu seems about as absurd

[0:03:42] <%neroforte177> absolutely in character
[0:03:44] <%Heart_of_Gold9000> but thats hype though

[0:03:50] <%NitronStreams> mvci
[0:03:50] <OldManDeckardCain> if takamura can punch a bear, ryu can punch a monster
[0:03:51] <%ChrisPlaysThing> he's wearing transmogged gauntlets, cmon Kappa
[0:03:51] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt More absurd than Phoenix Wright yelling Wesker into submission?
[0:03:53] <%saiyanblitz> X looks weird in this game
[0:03:53] <%brisk_dacat> nah he could take him
[0:03:55] <%Tman451> him and Hulk fucked that thing up

[0:04:23] <+Basilias_Maximus> He yelled Galactus in to submission.

[0:04:35] <%LegendGHT> so why is Ada behind it?
[0:04:36] <%Axellogic> Nick would fuck up like 12 time first tho and have to review his evidnce
[0:04:36] <%AzureGale> Boy I can't wait for Marvel Vs. Capcom 4
[0:04:37] <RyuuAoi> @patstaresat Did you LP RE Village?

[0:05:30] <+Basilias_Maximus> You should cast your phone to your TV and point your camera at that. Then it'd really be Best Friends Classic. @patstaresat

[0:21:08] <rekinom> Oh this is how the DMCV deluxe edition arm got in
[0:21:10] <%andrewofbob> "This new arm better last longer" he said, right before he used Break Away

[0:21:21] <BigFingerRo> @robosqueeb Funny you should say that, someone posted fanart of megaman with a REALLY feminine figure on this art server I'm in, and people were super weirded out because it's a kinda formal place for for-realzies artists

[0:23:39] <SyLuX45> Ada was a hidden characters in the old days of TEPPEN
[0:23:39] <rekinom> To be fair, Nergigante does look like something Nero would fight in DMC
[0:23:39] <+HellfireComms> YO HYPE
[0:23:41] <+konekoryugamine> YEP
[0:23:42] <%HairballCT> he saw a lady that was definitely not his ~*mother*~
[0:23:43] <@SoFarFetched> @ChrisPlaysThing this is the third time he started the stream because of hiccups.

[0:23:51] <DeltaPangaea> Calling these a 'story mode' is pretty generous.
[0:23:55] <scrumbotime> NERGIGANTE OFF THE TOP ROPE
[0:23:56] <%Dakuu75> omg, is there a "Dragonator" card?
[0:24:01] <T_Sasquatch> nero would totally beat nergigante easily LUL
[0:24:02] <kentrix11> GRAND MOTHER

[0:24:06] <%ChestMimik> Throw Dante's dead mom at a dragon
[0:24:13] <PanicSwytch> Why is Nero and Nergigante fighting in the Yakuza coliseum?
[0:24:14] <%Zeif00> Oh shit the Nerg music
[0:24:17] <%ChrisPlaysThing> @SoFarFetched aha, thank you for the quick response
[0:24:17] <CatRidder> Nero should be in monster hunter
[0:24:18] <+HellfireComms> @DeltaPangaea story modes are just a way to contextualize gameplay anyway
[0:24:19] <+diegobandzz> Oof this 720p is hurting my soul
[0:24:19] <%Intersceptre> Nero has dedicated Growth ults.
[0:24:19] <+goney> @Dakuu75 I dont think there is actually
[0:24:20] <%NitronStreams> Nero introduced the Growth mechanic
[0:24:23] <RyuuAoi> @chestmimik Woof

[0:24:42] <%NopeBadguy> LOOK AT THIS WALL OF HONDA
[0:24:43] <Mattais88> wall of sumo
[0:24:46] <%Daxalog> Nero is synonomous with the growth
[0:24:46] <rekinom> One of Honda's cheeks blocks one lane, the other cheek blocks the other one
[0:24:48] <Aydarkzero> kill that bad Robot from X6

Big scale pve is my jam. Also another reason those bans on the people harassing big streamer man were so important. Is because in wow they never so that. People do that all the time in wow.
[0:33:13] <TheCoobie> you bringing in stuff
[0:33:14] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt Yes, to get growth points, you have to play more units and you get growth points by their mana costs.
[0:33:16] <%Romuken> You have a phone for twitch?!

[0:37:37] <%greasypete00> the jiggles LUL
[0:37:40] <heartlesshealer> Irish succubi? Leanen Sidh?
[0:37:45] <KingZaffy> You can tap the cards for info
[0:37:47] <%Intersceptre> the card rotation fucked up my Rotten Vale deck with infinite graveyard pulls.
[0:37:49] <Dragon_Batman> They have a bar under their ap top right
[0:37:50] <%vitoxxi> top right corner?
[0:37:51] <%TopTierHarley> tap
[0:37:53] <+Lord0Mugen> @patstaresat are you going to play Runterra again sometime for stream?
[0:37:53] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt Top left of the card. If it's already played, hold your finger over the card for more info.
[0:37:54] <bigb00gi3> looks like the first number when you poke a card
[0:37:57] <Bustahhwulf> look at their ATB during the action phase
[0:37:57] <heartlesshealer> Leanen Sidh will grant you talent in exchange for your life force
[0:37:58] <%senorpapel> Only way is to math it
[0:37:58] <ZeludeRose> WITH YOUR EYES PAT

[0:38:14] <%RealThiele> top left of the card is MV?
[0:38:14] <Ravioli_Ronin> Is the audio being recorded with a 2001 Sony handy cam?
[0:38:14] <%GigaSeifer> white number in top-left is the cost of a card
[0:38:18] <%Daxalog> it wont let you use it on non targets
[0:38:19] <Saltmeisterr> Oh yeah
[0:38:23] <@SoFarFetched> @Ravioli_Ronin phone streaming
[0:38:25] <%Romuken> what about heimer @PatStaresAt
[0:38:25] <gunstars20> S1 Nerg was great LUL
[0:38:26] <+itsgundamu> yea black is warlock
[0:38:27] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt The tradeoff for the life cost is that Nerg can play stronger cards for cheaper
[0:38:27] <+HellfireComms> couldn't take the dragon dick. Sad!
[0:38:29] <OpenYourEels4TheNextFeels> their mp is under their AP, but only when the stack is resolving

[0:38:31] <@PlagueOfGripes> what was your plan, morg? to kiss him?
[0:38:31] <+konekoryugamine> Strong, yeah, but the HP gauge is the limiter
[0:38:32] <%Intersceptre> Black in general is either a stomp or a long prolonged unbeatable card mill
[0:38:32] <%RealThiele> black <3
[0:38:34] <The_madman_198> booty

[0:39:21] <%IamGrapes> Wesker is Elder Dragon confirmed
[0:39:22] <DSD24> Stop laughing Nergigante
[0:39:23] <tanarath> Some of these stories have actual depth, like Ryu's.
[0:39:25] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Flight attacks directly
[0:39:28] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt Flight goes over defenders without flight and blocks attackers with flight
[0:39:29] <Saltmeisterr> @snugglepuggs the fuck yo mean?
[0:39:31] <KingZaffy> It's MTG "Flying"
[0:39:32] <tanarath> Others...
[0:39:33] <+konekoryugamine> Two OP decks fight each other live
[0:39:34] <%Intersceptre> Flight is pretty godly
[0:39:34] <pi_in_the_sci> It's what Flying always does
[0:39:35] <amonimis> @snugglepuggs you prolly have chat filter on
[0:39:37] <%AlteisenReiseZ> UNLESS they have Anti-Air
[0:39:40] <%robosqueeb> flight can only be blocked by flight i think i dont really know
[0:39:41] <@PlagueOfGripes> "Nergigante laughed harder, as Wesker begged him to stop laughing."
[0:39:41] <@SoFarFetched> Can you guys NOT with the Nergigante and "haha N word" shenanigans geefAwk
[0:39:47] <reonome> is flight still super OP
[0:39:50] <+Lord0Mugen> I lost my cards so I just don't play anymore.
[0:39:51] <KitsuneCrew> why is the audio quality so fucking garbage

[0:41:01] <Toste_> @SoFarFetched can't be surprised....but you can ban them! ^_^
[0:41:01] <%thebeargoesHONK> i do hope he plays better against actual people
[0:41:01] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt If Nerg doesn't kill fast, he kills himself on his own life costs
[0:41:01] <Dragon_Batman> The stupid was the friends we made along the way
[0:41:05] <DSD24> Oh its Ratha
[0:41:06] <SyLuX45> Strong if you don’t kill yourself lol
[0:41:11] <ZeludeRose> something stupid
[0:41:12] <%andrewofbob> Is the story mode handicapping the opponent's starting health?
[0:41:12] <%Axellogic> Stop calling me stupid farfetched I didnt do anything
[0:41:15] <DeltaPangaea> He was only after THE DNA
[0:41:17] <%CappuccinoGuil> But does the lore say WHY Nergigante is so good at card games?
[0:41:18] <Shmo_MonHun> LUL
[0:41:19] <%Broand> snackalos

[0:41:21] <%Monkeyweed21> oh no Wesker is gonna get divebombs
[0:41:26] <%Romuken> And Nergi was like "Oki"
[0:41:26] <BigFingerRo> D ON D VIOLENCE
[0:41:28] <%HairballCT> and then they kissed
[0:41:31] <%Valdorick> Valdorick subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 23 months! "And then Wesker got his ass beat in, but said "You didn't win" and fucked off"
[0:41:35] <%NopeBadguy> This Rathalos stream is great
[0:41:36] <Dragon_Batman> Why do I feel like Pat looked at the camera when he did that LUL
[0:41:37] <+konekoryugamine> DRAGONS PLAYING CARD GAMES
[0:41:38] <PanicSwytch> Turf Battle
[0:41:39] <%senorpapel> Why do nergigante and rath hate each other so much?
[0:41:41] <%NateyBeak> i mean it LOOKS super good!
[0:41:44] <DSD24> There's like 3 Rathas
[0:41:45] <+trackles_64> play teppen u fucks
[0:41:45] <%RealThiele> LUL yea
[0:41:46] <%Puhff> "Use creator Code patstaresat for 10% off!" - Rathalos
[0:41:47] <%NopeBadguy> I feel like maybe you shoulda gotten Woolie to help LUL
[0:41:52] <$spardanwarrior> Story mode handicaps the crap out of your opponents
[0:41:57] <%Valdorick> Wait fuck I didn't mean to make that my sub message... womp.
[0:41:58] <+Lord0Mugen> isn't Nergigante part of the Dragons that kill hunters and use their bodies to strengthen themselves?
[0:42:00] <%CappuccinoGuil> @senorpapel they are exes who had a real bad breakup
[0:42:00] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt This Rathalos is super powered, play its story.
[0:42:01] <+lordericter> nugget should roll rathalos
[0:42:06] <DianaTheAscian> Pat is super looking at the camera after he makes a joke
[0:42:07] <%Intersceptre> the anjanath card for 1 is the basis of sacrifice decks
[0:42:13] <+Ipsenscastle> Why is Rathalos' back on fire?
[0:42:25] <%senorpapel> @cappuccinoguil ahh, makes sense to me
[0:42:31] <DSD24> This is Violent Ratha
[0:42:38] <%maskofmichael> Why does that dragon have human ears?
[0:42:40] <%g0atmeal> g0atmeal subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months! Today I finally got a 3080 founders edition! It only required camping overnight in front of best buy. I'm excited to try it on elden ring. Cheers!
[0:42:52] <PanicSwytch> Its so odd that Woolie was sponsored for Yakuza 7 and Pat is sponsored for Teppen
[0:42:54] <%Intersceptre> @ipsenscastle its dreadking stabbed ratha
[0:42:57] <+konekoryugamine> oh now I see the ears
[0:43:01] <Dragon_Batman> They give little design flourishes to the characters in this game, Rath having that flame is one of em for some reason
[0:43:04] <SaltyAzteca> Lookit these monsters playing card games LUL
[0:43:07] <+itsgundamu> Rathalos was my favorite when I played Teppen, buffing the shit out of combo cards was really fun
[0:43:17] <%Monkeyweed21> use divebomb
[0:43:22] <DSD24> Paintball that Rathalos!
[0:43:27] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt Rathalos does big damage while Ryu deals damage directly a lot.
[0:43:32] <%Romuken> It's a B.M.B.
[0:43:33] <%NopeBadguy> Big units I mean
[0:43:38] <ZeludeRose> is a 3080 founders edition just a 3080 they kept in the oven longer

[0:43:45] <%CappuccinoGuil> @senorpapel it was real bad, nergi tossed all of rath's clothes in the middle of the forest, some kids were crying.
[0:43:46] <Born_2_Late> i wish this damn game let me play it
[0:43:52] <+Ipsenscastle> the 3D effect on Nerg's victory animation is really well done
[0:43:53] <+konekoryugamine> Lightning?!
[0:43:54] <%saiyanblitz> Why is Bison working with Kenshrio monster
[0:43:56] <%Romuken> Or Bowel Move Buster
[0:43:56] <Dragon_Batman> Zangief protecc from lightning
[0:44:00] <CatRidder> he is barkiing at bison
[0:44:00] <%IamGrapes> Zangief no like lightning?
[0:44:03] <%RealThiele> begone zeus!
[0:44:09] <%Valdorick> "You fought wesker, then fought Rath. The end."

[0:45:27] <+trackles_64> Pat is his dad?
[0:45:30] <%CappuccinoGuil> Chat, what does Dante and Peter Parker have in common? They both got a piece of Succubus action Kappa
[0:45:30] <ZComiX> CAPCOM really wants you to pound Morgan
[0:45:30] <PanicSwytch> Its Morrigan's goal to fuck the whole capcom universe
[0:45:30] <%Arweynn> BORK BORK
[0:45:31] <DSD24> Lilith is cool too

[0:45:49] <kentrix11> The CG artist threatens the writers so the put more Morrigan in the stories so they can draw more Morrigan.
[0:46:00] <Dragon_Batman> Everytime you play action cards I believe
[0:46:03] <ZeludeRose> @alphonseisbest it's #sponsored audio quality
[0:46:03] <DSD24> Is Jedah in this game?
[0:46:04] <%Intersceptre> resonate makes a card stronger everytime you play a action
[0:46:05] <%RealThiele> her nips lift her boobs
[0:46:06] <+kitdude192> !teppen
[0:46:06] <@Moobot> @kitdude192 Hey check out TEPPEN! It's cool! Use this link! https://gat.onelink.me/NitF/patstaresat

[0:46:12] <auraofdawn> resonate is the SHIT
[0:46:16] <ZeludeRose> !tekken
[0:46:18] <+HellfireComms> kill jester
[0:46:19] <rearedlogarithm> Morrigan is very... energetic.
[0:46:20] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt Resonate can also activate repeatedly which is why Dante has a ton of cheap do-nothing actions to help trigger it.
[0:46:22] <VentWilsn> bruh dmc4 dante?
[0:46:23] <%Agami23> remember when jedah got corrupted by the soul stone and became evil?
[0:46:26] <Dragon_Batman> Jedah is in a few cards but not a hero
[0:46:27] <+Ilpala> damn that's a lot of liliths
[0:46:28] <+alphonseisbest> @ZeludeRose ew, why even bother then Kappa
[0:46:33] <%Daxalog> oh no a flying deck
[0:46:39] <%CappuccinoGuil> But what does Pot of Greed do?
[0:46:40] <%Intersceptre> hsein ko is a god tier resonate card
[0:46:42] <+Some_DOOD> @dsd24 jedah is in cards but not as a hero
[0:46:42] <%Romuken> Put yer titties away Lilith, my D.A.R.E. peeps are coming over for chickie nuggs.
[0:46:45] <DSD24> @Dragon_Batman Aww I like Jedah
[0:46:49] <+Ilpala> THIS DECK CAN FIT SO MANY LILITHS
[0:46:52] <ZeludeRose> hey rose that's me
[0:47:02] <%saiyanblitz> What happen in Nero story did he get X’s arm
[0:47:10] <%ssjklyco> She's Dead-agin
[0:47:12] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt Akuma has a mech with units that allows you to sacrifice units by playing stronger units over them
[0:47:14] <+Ipsenscastle> Man DMC4 Dante looks so weird
[0:47:17] <%Agami23> its cool that lumine is a card
[0:47:18] <%robosqueeb> morrigan getting bodied almost as hard as the darkstalkers franchise
[0:47:19] <+HellfireComms> Dante said NO HO'S
[0:47:21] <%IamGrapes> did they go with DMC2 Dante design?
[0:47:27] <+RootVeggie> then they fucked
[0:47:28] <%Intersceptre> try Morrigans decks theyre horseshit
[0:47:30] <Dragon_Batman> @DSD24 Yea he's super kool, who knows DarkStalkers doesn't have any more heroes yet so there is still chances
[0:47:38] <%RealThiele> but damn was Dante
[0:47:43] <DSD24> Aww yeah I love that Morrigan design
[0:47:47] <ZeludeRose> anyone else ever notice dmc4 dante's head is a little too small in game?
[0:47:48] <+Some_DOOD> Shame how Dante is the worst hero in the game
[0:47:49] <Toste_> @Intersceptre facts
[0:47:49] <%Intersceptre> Morrigans stuff in particular are "you dont play"
[0:47:50] <VentWilsn> wasnt dante's super that he used DT?
[0:47:51] <+alphonseisbest> is pat having fun?
[0:47:55] <%senorpapel> Be prepared for when you fight morrigan on ladder. She is the most frustrating hero to play against
[0:47:56] <%afronooch> vergel
[0:48:01] <%Broand> Dante is Prowess, A deck archtype based around cards which get better when you do the magic while they're on the field
[0:48:01] <Zap_Rowsdower32> Foolishness, Dante
[0:48:02] <%polothegreatest> hes cyber elf X
[0:48:02] <%Valdorick> Only 1 power!? He's not motivated enough.
[0:48:10] <ZeludeRose> virgil texas?
[0:48:16] <%ssjklyco> Whats with Angel Aura Mega Man?
[0:48:17] <DSD24> Is X a angel?
[0:48:19] <%Intersceptre> Morrigan plus actions plus Paolumu is arsehole
[0:48:21] <+Ilpala> HOW IS SHERRY STRONGER THAN VERGIL
[0:48:23] <DSD24> He got a halo
[0:48:23] <%zeroarturia> Wrong X. This is X series X
[0:48:25] <+CarissMcbober> Oh hey, this game. I played this game a lot when it first came out, but at high level play it got frustrating dealing with lag hacks and stuff. The timing based gameplay just doesn't work for me when lag becomes a factor.
[0:48:27] <%Daxalog> resonate causes its effect when you play spells
[0:48:32] <SaltyAzteca> Descending Missouri Kappa
[0:48:40] <PanicSwytch> I think its Copy X from MMZero
[0:48:40] <ZeludeRose> @zeroarturia the xbox console?
[0:48:41] <%RealThiele> goo child stronger than vergil LUL
[0:48:46] <SyLuX45> More power
[0:48:50] <DianaTheAscian> X looks really weird in this game
[0:48:58] <%Valdorick> Now he's MOTIVATED
[0:49:01] <%FacetiousAF> which one is the pat vtuber
[0:49:05] <DublinRage> I feel sorry for the X voice actors that have to follow up after Mark Gatha in "Command Mission" and the PSP remake
[0:49:06] <%NitronStreams> its just a generic Teppen version Megaman X
[0:49:08] <%Intersceptre> HsienKo with +2/+2 resonate and a long action chain is absolute horseshit
[0:49:23] <SaltyAzteca> Motivated
[0:49:27] <%RealThiele> that X model looks zombified
[0:49:29] <+RootVeggie> He needs more power
[0:49:30] <DeltaPangaea> Proper MOTIVATIONS
[0:49:31] <+Some_DOOD> POWAH lytMOTIVATED
[0:49:32] <+storkeylope> lytMOTIVATED
[0:49:33] <DSD24> Yoo is Hsien Ko good in this game?
[0:49:33] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Nasty Pregnant X

[0:50:01] <%Intersceptre> slow slows them.
[0:50:01] <%RealThiele> LUL im slow
[0:50:02] <%AlteisenReiseZ> halves attack speed
[0:50:05] <ZeludeRose> i dont trust dante around sherry
[0:50:09] <%Intersceptre> LUL
[0:50:10] <%saiyanblitz> No this isn’t happening
[0:50:12] <%Dracoman13> Dracoman13 subscribed with Prime. 
[0:50:15] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Again why arent there any CLASSIC MEGAMAN in this game CAPCOM
[0:50:24] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt Standard attack time is 10 seconds. Slow is 20. Haste is 5.
[0:50:31] <MasterTonberry23> blue twerp?
[0:50:32] <%Valdorick> "Nothing personal."
[0:50:35] <darkelfdebauchery> no egg cam?
[0:50:37] <PanicSwytch> Dante doesn't know about sex
[0:50:40] <%RealThiele> classic megaman gets treated like a child by capcom its weird
[0:50:40] <DSD24> Did we find out who Hoodie Lady was?
[0:50:41] <DanThePumpkinman> i remember liking jill in this way back when i played it. she still good?
[0:50:45] <Dragon_Batman> There was pizza on the line
[0:50:47] <Bustahhwulf> dante is based
[0:50:48] <DSD24> Is it Ada?
[0:50:50] <%Daxalog> Chun li is the aggressor here
[0:50:52] <%NopeBadguy> @DSD24 It's Ada
[0:50:52] <%Intersceptre> Jill is solid
[0:50:57] <+HellfireComms> Dante and the Quest to Understand Sex
[0:50:58] <ZeludeRose> bassd on what
[0:51:03] <%saiyanblitz> Did Ada like fuse with a mysterious deity or something
[0:51:04] <DSD24> @NopeBadguy That checks out
[0:51:07] <%Intersceptre> Jill in general just rinse repeats action cards for damage
[0:51:09] <%ChestMimik> Pat's fanfiction is getting weird
[0:51:10] <VentWilsn> MAN i forgot how bad Megaman X looked
[0:51:11] <DianaTheAscian> Dante on his quest to learn what sex is
[0:51:22] <MasterTonberry23> I play myself, in attack mode!
[0:51:35] <Bustahhwulf> tier 0 beta deck NotLikeThis
[0:51:42] <CatRidder> DONT SHAKE HIS HAND
[0:51:43] <%senorpapel> @dsd24 she is good in very highrolly decks. You play her and she gets +2/+2 every time you play an action. So you basically make her so big that if she connects you win
[0:51:44] <%RealThiele> blanka: ok
[0:51:47] <Dragon_Batman> Be glad she's not Yawn-Li
[0:52:05] <%Intersceptre> Yawn Li Trinity was the meta of all metas
[0:52:09] <MasterTonberry23> the yawn-li deck is still OP?
[0:52:09] <dan_g_v> won't even care
[0:52:22] <DSD24> @senorpapel Oh I see so you gotta build around her for the big damage
[0:52:23] <ZeludeRose> what genre of deck do i play in this game if i want to make people feel physical pain?
[0:52:25] <Dragon_Batman> I think you can check in your list of cards
[0:52:32] <%RealThiele> fuck that card specifcally
[0:52:35] <%Intersceptre> Yawn Li is still okay but black actions ruin it
[0:52:49] <Dragon_Batman> I don't think it's as op as it used to be
[0:52:51] <%Valdorick> Get destroyed AI
[0:53:01] <MasterTonberry23> @ZeludeRose that would be walking up to people and saying "hey dude check out this card game!" then when they look you kick them in the crotch
[0:53:03] <+Abd0022> how do you find this compared to LoR? @PatStaresAt
[0:53:06] <%Sol_Install> So it's canon
[0:53:09] <2DSuperiority> very cringe Chun
[0:53:09] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Pat Talking shit to the Tutorial lol

[0:53:20] <@SoFarFetched> Legends of Runeterrra
[0:53:20] <+Abd0022> Runeterra
[0:53:22] <%senorpapel> @dsd24 yeah, deck has problem that if it takes too long to get her you lose. So you’re basically gambling for it. But real nice to just give her flight and hit for like 25
[0:53:22] <@SoFarFetched> geefBruh

[0:54:01] <ZeludeRose> downLOad Rteppen
[0:54:01] <+Ipsenscastle> Mundus is back, Pat, pay attention
[0:54:01] <%Intersceptre> Id say he should play the missions tutorial rather than the story, they added it later its more explanative
[0:54:06] <JeoDood> he is back
[0:54:08] <kentrix11> Mundus did say he would come back
[0:54:09] <%RealThiele> he got better
[0:54:09] <%Monkeyweed21> @ZeludeRose add as many random effects as you can. The enemy cant counter you if you dont know what you'll do
[0:54:10] <%Valdorick> V-Vergil? Who? My Urizan is only Mundas
[0:54:10] <@SoFarFetched> He should have totally said this was way better than LoR Kappa
[0:54:11] <MasterTonberry23> dante never killed mundus, what are you talking about?
[0:54:13] <BigFingerRo> @Broand My mouth is agape at the idea of this sentence existing and making sense
[0:54:15] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt Do Felyne
[0:54:15] <Dragon_Batman> Check out card art?
[0:54:18] <%polothegreatest> zero
[0:54:22] <%andrewofbob> Capcom loves unkilling villains in their crazy crossover games
[0:54:36] <MasterTonberry23> Mundus never died
[0:54:36] <DeltaPangaea> So this Dante is from EARLIER in the DMC timeline it sounds like?
[0:54:37] <darkelfdebauchery> Where does Deeno appear in this game?
[0:54:40] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> These arent really Tutorial. these help explain the characters
[0:54:40] <%RealThiele> pay 2 win, pay 2 win!
[0:54:43] <dan_g_v> Onimusha?
[0:54:44] <Bustahhwulf> samurai warriors
[0:54:45] <Naho_Saenoki> Oichi from Sengoku Basara

[0:54:47] <%monsieurfantastic> black dick
[0:54:47] <ZeludeRose> @deltapangaea dmc4 yeah
[0:54:48] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt It's a char for Sengoku Basara
[0:54:48] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Oichi from Sengoku Barara
[0:54:49] <+glassesaregod> @PatStaresAt Oichi from Sengoku Basara
[0:54:49] <adamant1333> sengoku basara
[0:54:49] <%Intersceptre> could we gift Pat a deck?
[0:54:49] <%Paperware> Sengoku Basara Oichi
[0:54:51] <%zyberion626> from the sengoku basara
[0:54:53] <%AlteisenReiseZ> *Basara
[0:54:54] <SyLuX45> Oichi
[0:54:54] <heartlesshealer> sengoku basara
[0:54:55] <@SoFarFetched> OH SHIT ITS OICHI
[0:54:56] <Dragon_Batman> Ochio I think from Sengoku yea
[0:54:57] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Pat not a real Capcom Fan confirmed
[0:54:58] <+Some_DOOD> oichi
[0:55:00] <MasterTonberry23> Oichi from Sengoku Basara
[0:55:01] <Dragon_Batman> Oichi that was it
[0:55:06] <%Intersceptre> BULLSHIT meta
[0:55:06] <+HellfireComms> still need to finish Okami HD
[0:55:07] <MasterTonberry23> woof
[0:55:10] <ZeludeRose> doggie
[0:55:14] <%RealThiele> bork deck
[0:55:15] <styptysat> hol' up Teppen?
[0:55:17] <%Intersceptre> i fucking hated Ammy decks
[0:55:19] <nertiaa> basaraaaa
[0:55:20] <heartlesshealer> god it's so weird seeing them with normal people style
[0:55:20] <%Daxalog> Amaterasu can fuck off. Hate what it does to dark decks
[0:55:21] <ZeludeRose> wan wan
[0:55:22] <Saltmeisterr> damn gud art
[0:55:25] <PanicSwytch> Yooo they should bring back sengoku basara
[0:55:26] <%Valdorick> YOOOOOOO
[0:55:26] <%Intersceptre> the worst most unbeatable decks
[0:55:29] <+HellfireComms> this sort of makes sense
[0:55:30] <Mattais88> bork bork kill a god bork
[0:55:30] <BigFingerRo> wet with moisture, as opposet to being wet with dryness
[0:55:34] <Crushter> Why'd they pick Oichi and not... any of the main Sengoku peepoles
[0:55:35] <VentWilsn> please dont do X
[0:55:35] <gslayer14> oh shit, it's ya boi
[0:55:40] <ZeludeRose> @Daxalog but... doggie
[0:55:47] <MasterTonberry23> @PanicSwytch they should release SB4 in the west for starters
[0:55:48] <+cascadepersona> Would be nice if they localized Sengoku Basara 4
[0:55:49] <heartlesshealer> ammy in the octagon
[0:55:53] <Naho_Saenoki> I like Oichi. Creepy shadow hands all day.
[0:55:58] <%RetroCop87> yo, that was some cool art though
[0:56:06] <%Intersceptre> Crush cant be counter attacked
[0:56:07] <NoRedeemingValue> that's a good doggess
[0:56:11] <nertiaa> localized basara when
[0:56:12] <WakeUpThrow> I fucking love how apparently Ammy is the bane of dark decks. Suits the character
[0:56:15] <DSD24> Eyy its Ammy
[0:56:16] <DensityD> nani
[0:56:18] <%RealThiele> crush 40 :O
[0:56:20] <%senorpapel> @crushter not auper sure, but i assume it’s because none of the other super fit black?
[0:56:23] <ZeludeRose> i havent played okami so this might as well be canon
[0:56:24] <Crushter> @cascadepersona don't remind me about how sadly dead Sengoku is
[0:56:27] <%Intersceptre> Ammy is the bane of all decks
[0:56:27] <Dragon_Batman> I didn't play much when Ame came out so I'm not super shure what she got
[0:56:28] <VentWilsn> DRAG HIS ASS AMMY
[0:56:30] <PanicSwytch> @mastertonberry23 They've made 3 other SB?
[0:56:35] <%Valdorick> @nertiaa You mean DEVIL KINGS!?
[0:56:35] <dan_g_v> definitely canon
[0:56:37] <ManfredA> my favorite monster hunter character, Pyron
[0:56:40] <thetruenicster> Memory is, the more action cards you use, the more effective a card will be
[0:56:43] <KreuzDrache> oh shoot that was pyron from dark stalkers?
[0:56:47] <DSD24> Did only one Sengoku Basara game come out in English?
[0:56:48] <%Daxalog> memory is the amount of spells you played this match
[0:56:49] <%Intersceptre> Ammy deck had all cards do instant damage on Growth 3 and theyre all 3MP
[0:56:53] <+cascadepersona> @crushter The best musou series
[0:56:53] <%vitoxxi> okami characters without the okami artstyle is weird
[0:57:06] <darkelfdebauchery> Oh you GDQ is running KOTOR
[0:57:08] <nertiaa> theres like 5 games
[0:57:08] <%RealThiele> that rat has a knife!
[0:57:09] <%NitronStreams> oh man realistic Amy is wierd
[0:57:11] <Dragon_Batman> @KreuzDrache Ye he's got a couple of cards that represent
[0:57:18] <Crushter> @senorpapel well I suppose that makes sense, the most "dark" are her and Nobunaga so might as well use her
[0:57:19] <Naho_Saenoki> @PanicSwytch Yup. The first got a gutted localization called Devil Kings on PS2, the senond never did, we got the third one on PS3, but not its expansion, and we also never got the 4th one.
[0:57:22] <darkelfdebauchery> that game gotta be busted
[0:57:28] <ManfredA> does Nergigante have a gimmick with regenning cards?
[0:57:32] <MasterTonberry23> and nergi loves being a butt
[0:57:34] <BigFingerRo> Oh fuckka my shitte
[0:57:39] <DianaTheAscian> why that attack for the special cinematic?
[0:57:39] <+RootVeggie> Hayabusa is a good boy
[0:57:45] <%Intersceptre> Nerg has some scarifice/return cards
[0:57:56] <+burntbagels13> Hayabusa is a motorcycle
[0:57:56] <DSD24> Oh no Orochi
[0:58:00] <BigFingerRo> I miss Pat's david cage accent
[0:58:00] <ZeludeRose> doesnt Sengoku Basara have that fucked up kusoge fighter too?
[0:58:02] <dan_g_v> Not me!
[0:58:10] <%Valdorick> Now fight Orochi THREE TIMES IN A ROW
[0:58:12] <PanicSwytch> I only heard of the PS3 SB
[0:58:12] <TheAntiNihilist> Say waaaaaah
[0:58:13] <reddpop_> and itll be orochi 3 more times!
[0:58:13] <%MugenSandan> Not I psaDogchamp
[0:58:16] <%Daxalog> nice
[0:58:17] <Naho_Saenoki> @ZeludeRose It sure does!
[0:58:18] <BigFingerRo> I didn't thunk it
[0:58:19] <tanarath> Noo one
[0:58:25] <%NitronStreams> guess we gotta kill Orochi AGAIN
[0:58:25] <MasterTonberry23> look at that dog butt
[0:58:42] <%RealThiele> bite his dick ammy
[0:58:43] <%twistedj3ster> This makes me want Pat to read classic literature but put his ad lib spins on it
[0:58:43] <ZeludeRose> damn ame you fart with that ass?
[0:58:45] <%senorpapel> @dianatheascian that was nerg’s hero art. So special cinematic to use it
[0:58:48] <DianaTheAscian> They both majored in greek philosophy
[0:59:00] <%Intersceptre> watch this ammy just go nuts everytime a card is played
[0:59:08] <MasterTonberry23> roar roar
[0:59:09] <Crushter> I just realized how wacky it is that a Sengoku Bas character isn't in Samurai Showdown
[0:59:21] <Jaysky> Yo is that Ammy?
[0:59:28] <nertiaa> HANBEI MY LOVE
[0:59:33] <ZeludeRose> no its nergigante
[0:59:37] <MasterTonberry23> @Jaysky No thats Rathalos
[0:59:45] <DianaTheAscian> @senorpapel I mean its kind of a boring move to make a cinematic Nerg has cooler attacks than that
[0:59:46] <Dragon_Batman> Fishing boy is gonna be the strongest warrior around
[0:59:52] <Jaysky> That's both
[0:59:55] <%BinaryFireball> pat plays teppen but wont play mtg :(

[1:19:31] <%Monkeyweed21> I can't believe pat got sponsored on the first stream he's ever done on twitch
[1:19:32] <wohdin> you and other guy who was also not woolie
[1:19:34] <ManfredA> oh hey crusty Nergi theme
[1:19:35] <PanicSwytch> Capcom acknowledges u superior to woolie in teppen
[1:19:35] <MasterTonberry23> @WutangchickeN on hour 134 of disco elysium last i saw
[1:19:42] <Dragon_Batman> Multi hits I believe
[1:19:44] <%thedankestmeeme> baBOOM
[1:19:44] <Bazark12> wow pat I sure am interested in playing this video game: TEPPEN because of your sponsorship and recommendation!
[1:19:45] <%RealThiele> G U N
[1:19:49] <auraofdawn> combo is x2 attack
[1:19:57] <DensityD> what if Sam and Max was a Capcom property
[1:20:13] <MasterTonberry23> what if sam and max was a cat
[1:20:21] <blue6sub6remnant6> If Sam & Max was Capcom we'd be in for some fun.
[1:20:25] <+WutangchickeN> @mastertonberry23 that shits turned into quite the lp
[1:20:25] <ZeludeRose> what if Ruby and Max was a Capcom property
[1:20:26] <Crushter> huh I really wrote this game off but genuinely doesn't seem that bad
[1:20:30] <DianaTheAscian> Then it would have been killed in the 2000s
[1:20:31] <%RealThiele> this opponent is doing. . .?
[1:20:34] <OpenYourEels4TheNextFeels> Possible explanation, the goal isn't to get you to show it off, the goal is to get you to understand it enough that you will be able to engage Woolie when he talks about it on podcast so he talks about it on the podcast more often.
[1:20:37] <%andrewofbob> The hotter Bison
[1:20:38] <%AzureGale> Zack and Wiki would have come competition
[1:20:39] <%NopeBadguy> Pat loves Dictators
[1:20:40] <Dragon_Batman> Love Bison so much he got 3 of em
[1:20:42] <%NitronStreams> This is delicious
[1:20:49] <orpleborple> Bison is lame
[1:20:52] <Dragon_Batman> Nice
[1:20:56] <DensityD> Mila Jovovich as Sam and Kevin Harte as Max
[1:21:03] <DSD24> Nelo Angelo is cool
[1:21:08] <+Weeewer> wow he just fucked up
[1:21:10] <Toste_> gg. well played other person XD
[1:21:11] <+Axle13j> THAT'S A BIG BOI

[1:21:13] <@Moobot> Hey check out TEPPEN! It's cool! Use this link! https://gat.onelink.me/NitF/patstaresat
[1:21:14] <Dragon_Batman> @OpenYourEels4TheNextFeels LUL
[1:21:15] <sirrice77> @OpenYourEels4TheNextFeels clearly it was an elaborate plan by woolie to get pat to duel him
[1:21:17] <+Axle13j> that was a big boi
[1:21:22] <ZeludeRose> @densityd who do you cast as Max & Ruby?
[1:21:27] <DensityD> was this missed lethal?
[1:21:28] <%RealThiele> hero power?
[1:21:28] <thetruenicster> Cause He's Almost OUT
[1:21:29] <Dragon_Batman> He probably has a shit hand
[1:21:29] <Toste_> bot?
[1:21:32] <%NitronStreams> F
[1:21:32] <MasterTonberry23> totally not a bot
[1:21:32] <Toste_> Kappa
[1:21:34] <Crushter> did that guy... mean.. to do that?
[1:21:35] <+glassesaregod> This absolutely is a bot
[1:21:35] <%Monkeyweed21> bot play
[1:21:36] <KyroDragon> oh F ranks.
[1:21:36] <%Neryl_> Neryl_ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 30 months! 
[1:21:37] <%andrewofbob> Is this a bot masquerading?
[1:21:38] <Dragon_Batman> Needs to throw away maybe
[1:21:42] <%aishman> So this is clearly a bot right?
[1:21:46] <+WutangchickeN> is the audio ass or is that on me? LUL
[1:21:46] <thetruenicster> Sometimes people will just use action cards if they have no units in their hand
[1:21:47] <%senorpapel> That guy has a brick hand
[1:21:48] <DSD24> Wesker kills a old man
[1:21:50] <%RealThiele> yea this is super a bot of like a 6yr old
[1:21:50] <+glassesaregod> THE BOT IS BEING HELPFUL <3
[1:21:52] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt He's probably out of applicable cards aand is tryingto cycle
[1:21:55] <+Axle13j> yea might be trying to get rid of stuff
[1:21:56] <%senorpapel> Just trying to get rid of stuff
[1:21:56] <reddpop_> griefing by wasting time?
[1:21:57] <Profmcstevie> It's bot matches early on I think, to get you started
[1:21:58] <%Monkeyweed21> pat you have lethal
[1:21:58] <+Weeewer> Nah could be anewbie tbh
[1:22:00] <DianaTheAscian> Good job super real totally not a bot player
[1:22:00] <%Daxalog> Maybe a fat finger?
[1:22:01] <+Weeewer> Ive done that before lol
[1:22:01] <SyLuX45> Too many action on his hand
[1:22:03] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Why does the audio sound like it's being recorded from a speaker?
[1:22:03] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt This dude bricked his hand stupid hard
[1:22:10] <gunstars20> Bricked
[1:22:13] <KingZaffy> I think he's just out of cards
[1:22:13] <californaya> that's a lot of Nelo Angelo
[1:22:14] <@SoFarFetched> @wizard_of_diamonds cause its his phone LUL
[1:22:14] <ZeludeRose> does this game use the fortnite bot system?
[1:22:17] <Dragon_Batman> There is a chance to get some shit hands
[1:22:20] <ianabstract> bricked hand and may be stalling and hoping you disconnect
[1:22:21] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt This dude had a really bad hand and his deck was just not cooperating I think
[1:22:23] <%aishman> What do you guys mean by bricked his hand?
[1:22:23] <%RealThiele> 28/15 LUL
[1:22:23] <DanThePumpkinman> @wizard_of_diamonds because it is
[1:22:24] <DianaTheAscian> hes trolling?
[1:22:32] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Makes sense
[1:22:33] <%NitronStreams> theres no easy was to throw away trash cards from you hand in this game. so getting hand locked is common
[1:22:36] <Crushter> Pat you paid these opponents off
[1:22:37] <mortalmanbaby> bro everyone watching ff14 what u doing playing teppen
[1:22:41] <MasterTonberry23> paid actor
[1:22:43] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt I wanna see you build a deck
[1:22:45] <Zombrocom> Nergi did the thing he does!
[1:22:47] <+Weeewer> yeah the matches got a good pacing
[1:22:48] <powerprotoman> what a good bot match
[1:22:50] <Dragon_Batman> New super I thin
[1:22:51] <thetruenicster> Well, yeah, cause you're in the lower tiers
[1:22:51] <%senorpapel> @nopebadguy you are definitely correct on thay
[1:22:53] <ZeludeRose> @mortalmanbaby getting paid
[1:22:58] <%Monkeyweed21> its cool how the game starts you against bots with similiar decks
[1:22:58] <MasterTonberry23> @mortalmanbaby hes being paid to
[1:22:59] <+WutangchickeN> I'd like to see you have the fun
[1:23:01] <@SoFarFetched> what is FF14? All we know is Teppen Kappa
[1:23:07] <DianaTheAscian> @aishman his hand has cards he can't play and are just stuck in he hand so a brick
[1:23:08] <+Ipsenscastle> more pack opening
[1:23:10] <+WutangchickeN> BlueStacks not working???
[1:23:12] <mortalmanbaby> GE TTHAT MONEY MY GUY
[1:23:12] <ZeludeRose> !tekken
[1:23:13] <DianaTheAscian> his*
[1:23:13] <%RealThiele> FF14 only works if you are playing from fresh everyone wants to watch someone gasp to THAT event
[1:23:14] <wohdin> this game doesnt seem to have huge finishes like enlightened runeterra matches
[1:23:16] <gunstars20> He's back
[1:23:22] <@SoFarFetched> @WutangchickeN Bluestacks can't handle teppen
[1:23:22] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> I'm afraid...I'm too busy farming arknights
[1:23:23] <KingZaffy> Could probably just modify the Nergigante starter deck with some of your pulls
[1:23:24] <ZeludeRose> @wutangchicken doesnt work with teppen

[1:26:32] <Dragon_Batman> Bout to get hit with healthy ppl and shields
[1:26:34] <%Emperor_Machinus> @blue6sub6remnant6 I think that is Copy X from the zero games
[1:26:34] <notabrobro> Power and yet no vergil?
[1:26:36] <+glassesaregod> @Profmcstevie They're just proof that X is honest. He doesn't lie.
[1:26:37] <ZeludeRose> @blue6sub6remnant6 he is in my heart ♥️
[1:26:38] <Saltmeisterr> why is X the only one with a redesign?
[1:26:39] <DianaTheAscian> is scoop originally from fgc lingo or card game lingo?
[1:26:47] <%senorpapel> @blue6sub6remnant6 it’s like the x design from the zero series
[1:26:48] <+Axle13j> X is so annoying lol
[1:26:54] <%Monkeyweed21> IRIS
[1:26:56] <%RealThiele> cat booba
[1:26:56] <%NitronStreams> both of their attacks landed at the same time
[1:27:01] <+Axle13j> Zero has a redesign too @Saltmeisterr
[1:27:02] <%polothegreatest> X before turning into cyberelf more like it
[1:27:04] <darkelfdebauchery> @PatStaresAt would you ever touch Totalwar Warhammer again? with their 3rd game coming out this year
[1:27:06] <KyroDragon> X was my favorite deck in Teppen
[1:27:08] <WakeUpThrow> The music in this is SeemsGood
[1:27:10] <Dragon_Batman> Here's hoping the other Iris isn't around
[1:27:13] <gunstars20> Big Heals
[1:27:24] <ZeludeRose> X is cool but whens the XXXTentacion deck
[1:27:33] <DianaTheAscian> @polothegreatest oh yeah he does kinda of look in between
[1:27:37] <%TopTierHarley> Gotta read effects
[1:27:44] <%TopTierHarley> that Iris gave her health on death
[1:27:50] <Dragon_Batman> Green has a lot of heals
[1:27:53] <%RealThiele> tricked by the english language
[1:27:56] <%Monkeyweed21> Iris gives health when she dies
[1:28:11] <DianaTheAscian> Does Pat not read effects?
[1:28:12] <ZeludeRose> iris more like isis
[1:28:22] <%NopeBadguy> X has consistently had really strong defense and health buffs
