[0:31:22] <%RageCasanova> Some people
[0:31:25] <@commanderclaw> "Remember the death plague?"
[0:31:27] <AfternoonConcession> this man is not ruled by the common law
[0:31:28] <%YakumoYomi> To be fair: if you showed up looking like you do now, I would be afraid to approach
[0:31:32] <DracaenaLeaf> 2020 is over which means covid is over Kappa
[0:31:32] <%TheMattman1313> That "Leave at door" is a separate option from the usual delivery instructions, I think people forget to read it
[0:31:34] <+transporterthesequel> Ugh
[0:31:35] <%chiazam> Did you put "Leave food at door" on the Instructions?
[0:31:36] <%Jekado> He needs to lick your face the new doordash greeting!
[0:31:38] <chhdez> The nerve
[0:31:40] <@SoFarFetched> @dekkitout Ive had done the option of "leave at door" for doordash and the lady asked me if I wanted to open the door or leave the food there.
[0:31:41] <+ClortTheTerrifier> Pat you look fucking crazy today
[0:31:42] <GarbageQueenEllie> I remember Eli

[0:31:53] <%RageCasanova> THE PLAGUE THAT CAUSED MANY GRIPES?!?!?!?
[0:31:54] <%scaryboisupreme> I just mentally tuned out for like 3 minutes what the fuck is the plague
[0:31:56] <marvel877> TOO MANY damn people at the grocery store keep shopping with NO MASK ON. I've been on edge every time I shop for supplies.

[0:32:29] <%ClericOfSparda> That's a bummer
[0:32:29] <+imspacingout> what's the point of going back to 1 when 2 is better
[0:32:43] <marvel877> @rumtumtugnutz he lost the charger for his clippers, he ordered a new one.
[0:32:44] <%Alazull> @PatStaresAt Can you look into the camera and say, "The thoughts become speed."?
[0:32:44] <+AngriestAngryArtist> nioh's problem is making strong builds a fucking nightmare to get, not because of hard bosses, but FUCKING SHIT the drops are ass!
[0:32:45] <%ClericOfSparda> but yeah Nioh's gear is weird

[0:33:13] <%Agami23> you guys are so god damn adorable

[0:46:21] <%SvenHolgersson> I'd think sell them

[0:46:34] <AfternoonConcession> seems very dangerous to have those out at all times

[0:51:21] <%YakumoYomi> Dxun is lit
[0:51:21] <%scaryboisupreme> Duxn is such a great part of the game
[0:51:23] <%Too_Much_Nukie> FOR MANDALORE
[0:51:34] <Flacc1dpancakes> the coolest Mandalorian of all time is on this planet
[0:51:38] <@SoFarFetched> and they'll go "Hey have you watched The Mandolorian Season 2 now out on Disney+?"
[0:51:38] <Broken_Sonex> So do you not want to turn Atton into a Jedi? @patstaresat
[0:51:46] <GarbageQueenEllie> Political conflict galore???
[0:51:47] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah Dxun is probably my favorite planet in the store.
[0:51:48] <MrBaldachin> I love the crusty "skyboxes" outside the ebon hawk
[0:51:56] <%Daxalog> Theres an HK momment here.
[0:52:00] <%President_Miyazaki> You ready for attempted coup planet?
[0:52:18] <clempstwitch> Oh boy here we go
[0:52:18] <%Xevtes> space battle
[0:52:21] <Flacc1dpancakes> Dxun/Onderon is my favorite plant storyline in the game
[0:52:24] <lets_be_friendos> everything is a trump reference even a 2005 game FeelsGoodMan
[0:52:27] <Jolnir> everyone looks dehydrated
[0:52:32] <NeroInfinite> Everyone is grey and cracked
[0:52:44] <$Dakuu75> he looks like good-shit or bad-shit?
[0:52:47] <%Too_Much_Nukie> IT'S THE DANK ONE ATTON
[0:52:52] <%dekkitout> The darkside forbids you from using baby lotion
[0:52:58] <chillingisc00l> everyone looks like they died
[0:53:00] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Nobody has ever "settled" Dxun
[0:53:01] <Jolnir> except kreia who looks great
[0:53:08] <%Alazull> Someone get that man a bottle of Pert and Popular
[0:53:33] <%toolofparanoia> LETS GO LOOT SOME DEAD JEDI GRAVES
[0:53:34] <$Dakuu75> the idea of "this doesn't look like the place where a WAR started" jsut urks me
[0:53:36] <mike2hands> go to the anderan sephora
[0:53:38] <%Daxalog> Is this ship constantly being shot down supposed to stop you from leaving early and tangling yourself like KOTOR1?
[0:53:45] <+AzureGale> I farted, sorry
[0:53:45] <GarbageQueenEllie> the Demon Moon, aka exile ptsd central
[0:53:47] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt In canon Dxun is where the exile first got noticed as a general. They led a squad that took a Mandalorian outpost with like 10 guys and no losses.
[0:53:59] <$Dakuu75> C'MON, DO IT, KILL ME
[0:54:01] <%TheresAGoff> Shes looking rough
[0:54:22] <GarbageQueenEllie> @Too_Much_Nukie Exile is underrated in the Wars. Revan gets all the credit.
[0:54:34] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah but Revan noticed.
[0:54:37] <$Dakuu75> You go this way! I'll go home!
[0:54:40] <%Daxalog> Kaeryn does NOT care
[0:54:43] <OzzySnek> "We landed here for a reason" I dunno, gravity probably helped with that reason somewhat...
[0:54:44] <robo_badger> We did land here for a reason: WE WERE GETTING SHOT AT
[0:54:51] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Nobody else noticed Meetra was doing cool shit but Revan/Senpai noticed her.
[0:55:01] <GarbageQueenEllie> @Too_Much_Nukie Hell, if Revan noticed me, I'd feel like I fuckin made it!
[0:55:10] <$Dakuu75> spite-jedi lol

[1:00:36] <robo_badger> The Force is trying to stop Darth Karen

[1:03:12] <$Dakuu75> how long would it take to re-install the game?
[1:03:12] <NitronStreams> part (final)
[1:03:12] <%Too_Much_Nukie> It's an issue with Dxun's fog that appears with mods.
[1:03:14] <+AzureGale> Well that's just great
[1:03:14] <Dragovus> BETRAYL!
[1:03:15] <heartlesshealer> Karen got shut out of the solar system

[1:04:31] <@commanderclaw> "You should play this Clemps" 10 minutes later the game starts dying
[1:04:32] <%RageCasanova> I ever mention that its reasons like this that it took me 7 run attempts over 10 years to ever beat Kotor 1?
[1:04:32] <%ghostofsolomon> @abelincoln_catpuncher hahaha noted thks dude
[1:04:42] <heartlesshealer> Menu real!
[1:04:44] <echobee_tv> Why is this era of 3d games just so not futureproofed?
[1:04:44] <NitronStreams> Amazing
[1:04:46] <heartlesshealer> Yay!
[1:04:48] <+grandtwinkus> Don't worry guys, it's working as intended
[1:04:51] <%SirGO0SE> gameplay go up
[1:05:12] <+AzureGale> Wouldn't it suck if pat was only able to get a little further into the game each time he restarted it
[1:05:13] <Too_Much_Nukie> You can also try resetting the Dxun module to see if that fixes it.
[1:05:15] <dekkitout> ...
[1:05:18] <Dragovus> This game was always held together with chewing gum and twine
[1:05:18] <%TimetodiveLTX> NO WUM
[1:05:23] <+NovaKnightmare> Its a bug
[1:05:25] <%wibbwobbler> whoa
[1:05:28] <%cvp5127> rng bugs
[1:05:28] <nivlac_555> just roll with it
[1:05:28] <GarbageQueenEllie> That happens when you skip movie
[1:05:29] <Goodvibes99508> the force works in mysterious ways
[1:05:36] <+AzureGale> The game is being SILENCED
[1:05:36] <%NovaKnightmare> it usually wears off if I remember
[1:05:41] <%MrUnKnownAlien> Lol
[1:05:43] <%NovaKnightmare> but its been a while
[1:05:48] <%Too_Much_Nukie> It does wear off yeah.

[1:06:32] <GarbageQueenEllie> GO-T0: This game. It is... broken.
[1:06:39] <NitronStreams> is this one of those things where playing the game off an ssd makes it load so fast it breaks?

[1:07:37] <Valentinius_Anodyne> I love the Kotor games, but they are definitely janky at times
[1:07:43] <%RageCasanova> He made it past Atris... further than I did when my game took a shit
[1:07:45] <%SirGO0SE> it was what Paige put on the desktop wasnt it
[1:08:04] <%dekkitout> The horse skeleton pornz?
[1:08:06] <NitronStreams> why rpgs gotta be such jank garbage
[1:08:37] <nivlac_555> they should put out a remaster where the game actually runs
[1:08:48] <%Jekado> Looks like Kotor is taking a Detour huh fellas psaSmug
[1:08:55] <%RageCasanova> They did. Its for phones
[1:09:01] <Valentinius_Anodyne> 3D RPGs on PC from this era seem to be universally janky on modern systems
[1:09:02] <nivlac_555> dang
[1:09:06] <%MassConnect> I've never been able to play SFV
[1:09:11] <%dekkitout> Speaking of, how stable is that Crysis remaster?
[1:09:14] <echobee_tv> @Jekado A Star Wars: Detours, if you will.
[1:09:16] <Krisaeron> I feel that Pat is very ashamed and angry and embarassed at this jank stuff
[1:09:28] <%Too_Much_Nukie> The version Pat is playing is also an updated Steam version that added widescreen support and is generally more stable.
[1:09:45] <heartlesshealer> the money button

[1:09:54] <Krisaeron> Its the Ginger Curse Pat

[1:09:58] <%MassConnect> you love busted games
[1:10:00] <GarbageQueenEllie> this must be the work of an enemy stand
[1:10:02] <+AzureGale> The universe hate you, Pat
[1:10:03] <%MegboyManuel> why is Karen's hair white now???
[1:10:06] <Valentinius_Anodyne> It's your stand, Pat. This is established canon
[1:10:07] <%YakumoYomi> Twerka ATM
[1:10:11] <echobee_tv> How's the GOG version?
[1:10:13] <heartlesshealer> I think it happened to woolie before too. This one's more the KotoR curse than the Pat curse
[1:10:21] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You don't have to no, you can just override the module.
[1:10:21] <%SomeSageAdvice> ever since Vinny came onto your podcast all that time ago, he passed the curse onto you @patstaresat
[1:10:23] <@SoFarFetched> @MegboyManuel because darkside
[1:10:25] <%MegboyManuel> Wasnt Karen blond?
[1:10:29] <Broken_Sonex> Because you don’t have the Woolie black gift.
[1:10:35] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Put the file for the Dxun landing pad into your override folder for the game.
[1:10:47] <%MegboyManuel> omg her hair is all blown out too, is it also cause of the dark side??
[1:10:47] <%BinaryFireball> can twileks grasp things with their hair tenticles?
[1:10:49] <heartlesshealer> Karen was platinum blond, so close to silver
[1:10:52] <%BinaryFireball> just asking
[1:10:59] <%Undenizen> @MegboyManuel the dark side is a path to many forces some consider unnatural. like bleached roots.
[1:11:03] <%dekkitout> Oh lord, mod folder/super user shenanigans
[1:11:08] <GarbageQueenEllie> Geez it's been to long since I've had to do something like this
[1:11:22] <@SoFarFetched> Remember you need to explain to pat in baby steps Kappa
[1:11:23] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Basically every area in Kotor 2 has a file responsible for it, areas are called modules. If you take the one for Dxun landing pad and put it in the override folder for your game, the game will load a basic version of the area instead of a corrupted one.
[1:11:30] <%MegboyManuel> dude Karen went from having blond beautiful platinum hair, to blown out grey
[1:11:35] <Broken_Sonex> “How do....? I don’t.....”
[1:11:47] <subjectg> Wrong hangar

Gotta ask, does your back hurt from carrying so many of us through that trash fire of a year? I sincerely hope that Paige's back is doing okay, in all seriousness. Pet the babies!

[1:12:19] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> So much a Pagie moment
[1:12:22] <%MegboyManuel> there should be laws against busting out a light saber in public
[1:12:24] <%Arancet> at least you can twirl and go vroom vroom again
[1:12:25] <%dekkitout> That is very Karen of you to think you parked somewhere, when in fact you parked elsewhere

[1:12:51] <%dekkitout> I mean, Morrowind is also a classic tajRLY
[1:12:55] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah that's just a vanilla bug with Dxun's fog. TSLRCM seems to make it more common for some people but it also just happens.

[1:14:36] <Ultralazuli> well, he knows who kreia is because he's such a jedi weeb, but she's using her power to make him forget her.

[1:14:41] <nivlac_555> c'mon baby hold together
[1:14:50] <Broken_Sonex> I won’t let you figure out the plot of the game says Kreia
[1:14:59] <GarbageQueenEllie> @dekkitout Kreia mentions in one dialogue that she will sometimes intentionally cloak herself to people she doesn't want aware
[1:15:13] <Goodvibes99508> kreia says no plot for you

[1:16:32] <$Dakuu75> you can save if you want to, you can leave your friends behind, because your friends don't save, and if they don't save, then their no friends of mine~
[1:16:32] <heartlesshealer> sorry Pat
[1:16:37] <%slimmixrp> Well maybe try a different planet and come backl
[1:16:40] <Krisaeron> This should go in Pat's Personal Botchamania
[1:16:47] <+tupacula1996> HAhaHAhaHAha
[1:16:57] <%Too_Much_Nukie> I don't know, every time I get it I reset the module.
[1:17:00] <%slimmixrp> ?:
[1:17:06] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You could try quick saving and quick loading.
[1:17:12] <heartlesshealer> module = location
[1:17:14] <+projectmanatees> @Krisaeron paige corpsing on stream? send for the man
[1:17:15] <%Undenizen> I arrived late. what are we doing?
[1:17:25] <heartlesshealer> nukie's explanation was further up
[1:17:26] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You have to extract the file for the module from the .mod file though.
[1:17:31] <%Too_Much_Nukie> So you'd have to download ERFedit.
[1:17:32] <@commanderclaw> psaHoldon
[1:17:33] <%Dunmarkh> @Undenizen crashing
[1:17:35] <nivlac_555> lmao
[1:17:36] <Krisaeron> @projectmanatees she legit corsping, Pat should check on her
[1:17:38] <$Dakuu75> that explained, nothing.
[1:17:45] <%dekkitout> Yep. Modding.
[1:17:46] <nivlac_555> oh baby
[1:17:48] <GarbageQueenEllie> Hoo boy this is getting complez
[1:17:49] <nivlac_555> live moddingh
[1:17:49] <heartlesshealer> Too_Much_Nukie : Basically every area in Kotor 2 has a file responsible for it, areas are called modules. If you take the one for Dxun landing pad and put it in the override folder for your game, the game will load a basic version of the area instead of a corrupted one.
[1:17:50] <%Too_Much_Nukie> It'd be a whole process.
[1:17:50] <%slimmixrp> Anyeone have any console commands that could help lol
[1:17:51] <Broken_Sonex> SAY IN A WAYS HE CAN UNDERSTAND NUKIE
[1:17:52] <Ultralazuli> gg
[1:17:52] <mike2hands> oh maaaan
[1:17:53] <+Undenizen> @Dunmarkh yeah I see that!
[1:17:53] <NitronStreams> NotLikeThis
[1:17:55] <$Trenr> "Shit's fucked, yo."
[1:17:56] <%slimmixrp> Maybe a ateleport otu of ship bs code
[1:17:59] <Krisaeron> GAMBATTE PATTO-CHAN
[1:18:02] <%President_Miyazaki> Reality doesn't want you to go to Onderon today.
[1:18:03] <%Bailey__gaming> Tune in to see pat's head in his hands
[1:18:08] <%SirGO0SE> the game is fixing the game :)
[1:18:09] <%BinaryFireball> so is it still bad if they remade this game?
[1:18:19] <%cvp5127> live patching
[1:18:20] <$lutefiiisk> Pat is turning into a ball.
[1:18:27] <Krisaeron> How bout some Raffling while we wait for a fix?
[1:18:27] <%dekkitout> Is it a simple "copy, paste and replace" job?
[1:18:29] <%MegboyManuel> youre basically replacing corrupted files, ez
[1:18:30] <%Undenizen> READY FOR THE MOD CREATION STREAM, PAT?
[1:18:31] <%Fooguwu> Just mod the game into the game :)
[1:18:32] <nivlac_555> MOD MOD MOD MOD
[1:18:34] <heartlesshealer> gotta manually patch it
[1:18:35] <$lutefiiisk> Metroid Stream confirmed?
[1:18:35] <@commanderclaw> Time to watch some TECH SUPPORT
[1:18:36] <+TheMattman1313> Time for some Notepad ++ boys!
[1:18:39] <%TimetodiveLTX> where's the override folder
[1:18:43] <NitronStreams> this Kills the steeamer
[1:18:45] <subjectg> You save more time by doing it than by pissing around, yeah?
[1:18:47] <%BinaryFireball> backup game?
[1:18:48] <%slimmixrp> TECH STREAM or different planet
[1:18:51] <GarbageQueenEllie> Ah, I see. Just copy + paste a new file.
[1:18:51] <%dekkitout> @TheMattman1313 This guy knows
[1:18:57] <Krisaeron> !! Humanity at Risk !!
[1:18:58] <%Undenizen> Why didn't woolie have to do this?
[1:19:07] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You can download ERFEdit from Deadlystream.
[1:19:10] <%BinaryFireball> Not Pornograph...
[1:19:11] <Krisaeron> Woolie had the BlackGift
[1:19:16] <Krisaeron> Pat has the Ginger Curse
[1:19:17] <Noogiez> do the doing
[1:19:24] <%MassConnect> woolie didn't install extra mods
[1:19:24] <%RageCasanova> Dem glitches be random and unpredictabo
[1:19:25] <$Dakuu75> the question is, would we rather watch Pat play something else? Or watch him try to fix this mess?
[1:19:37] <subjectg> @dekkitout shit gets real when you break out vim
[1:19:38] <%Too_Much_Nukie> But like I said you could also try quick saving and quick loading while the screen is black, see if that fixes it.
[1:19:38] <$lutefiiisk> Play Stardew Valleyt
[1:19:39] <NitronStreams> PC Masterrace am I right? Kappa
[1:19:43] <Krisaeron> I'd stick around to watch him fix and suffer
[1:19:51] <%dekkitout> Atleast you don't have to download a mod, three additional patches, extract the esm files, merge them in a folder, zip the folder, then load them into LOOT
[1:20:14] <%Undenizen> i actually get very little enjoyment of seeing someone being bored AND frustrated.
[1:20:14] <nivlac_555> i definitely would want to see live on air modding
[1:20:31] <%Too_Much_Nukie> lol yeah it's easy to reset a module with KOTOR 2 but you have to download one of the modding tools.
[1:20:37] <%Undenizen> if it's like a 10 minute fix that's fine
[1:20:37] <%Too_Much_Nukie> At least the actual process is simple.
[1:20:58] <%dekkitout> @nivlac_555 It's a lot of copy and pasting files with the occasional use of notepad++ for configs
[1:20:59] <shockmaster3> oh im an hour late so is he gonna start playing in maybe another half hour?
[1:20:59] <Krisaeron> I'm glad we have Nukie to guide Pat through this <3
[1:21:20] <%Undenizen> @shockmaster3 game is bork borked
[1:21:42] <shockmaster3> ok be back in an hour
[1:21:53] <tukds> Is pat in the middle of Shower stomping?
[1:22:00] <%MassConnect> playing KOTOR2 vanilla isn't that bad
[1:22:13] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You download ERFEdit, extract the .git file from the .mod file for the area you want to reset, place that file in the override folder for the game.
[1:22:37] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Then you load the game and once you're successfully in the broken area, save and quit. Then remove the .git file from your override folder.
[1:22:39] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Should be fixed.
[1:22:46] <%Undenizen> Suggestion: perhaps pat could send his file to someone with expertise who could quickly solve the problem?
[1:23:02] <%Too_Much_Nukie> I don't remember the name for the DXUN landing pad file off the top of my head though.
[1:23:20] <%Too_Much_Nukie> These files are all in your KOTOR 2 game folder.
[1:23:25] <subjectg> Start with grabbing ERFEdit first
[1:23:32] <@SoFarFetched> baby steps
[1:23:38] <heartlesshealer> maybe private message Pat so the advice doesn't get lost in the chat, Nukie
[1:23:39] <@SoFarFetched> gotta explain in baby steps

[1:28:11] <justcallmebobplease> Pat your hair is glorious

[1:29:16] <%Too_Much_Nukie> For some reason my 601Dan was in lips not modules. I've got a clean install of the game so I don't know if it's just fucked.
[1:29:18] <%Ipsenscastle> this is why I don't game on PC if I can help it, this shit makes me feel real bad inside

[1:32:35] <%Puhff> No worries Binky

[1:33:19] <GarbageQueenEllie> the KOTOR games on pc gave birth to millions of masochists
[1:33:30] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Should be F5 I think.
[1:33:30] <%dekkitout> Prob F5 for quicksave
[1:33:46] <heartlesshealer> okay, but also what's quickload?
[1:33:46] <%SirGO0SE> f4 is save f5 is load
[1:33:53] <Broken_Sonex> We got a lot of solutions here. None are working
[1:33:53] <%Too_Much_Nukie> It's either^
[1:33:55] <%vivaldiva> this is bringing back fallout modding flashbacks
[1:33:57] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah F4 or F5.
[1:34:06] <%emperordread> It's F4 iirc
[1:34:07] <%Breaknoon> alt f4

[1:34:56] <%Breaknoon> WHERE DOG?
[1:35:00] <+kullumanati> Just beat Yakuza like a dragon 🐉. And the millennium tower. Awaiting true final tower. Lol

[1:38:45] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Override is the folder that tells the game to load this last.

[1:39:30] <%anticrust> like are you doing it on purpose?
[1:39:35] <%dekkitout> @redial_nick Welcome to nexus mods, where we limit download speeds to 1MPS
[1:39:37] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You'll want to save the game then remove the dxun file from override, probably save it somewhere else just in case.
[1:39:40] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Damn it.

[1:41:12] <omegadarknes> what happened i missed it
[1:41:17] <Ultralazuli> It was the dark side taking retribution for contacting the manager
[1:41:19] <%Too_Much_Nukie> It would happen at the same place if overriding it didn't fix it.
[1:41:20] <TurtlesAndTentacles> fuck.... this is sad
[1:41:21] <%BinaryFireball> sorry pat
[1:41:23] <%BinaryFireball> that sucks
[1:41:24] <nivlac_555> Damn, that sucks man
[1:41:28] <%Too_Much_Nukie> It'd be a mod conflict or a bad install, most likely.
