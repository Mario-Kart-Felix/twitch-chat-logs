[0:02:22] <Vantesla> @destro_223 been a while yes if I recall for the melee boost as in another tree it adds the extra to get 100% damage protection
[0:02:23] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt if you're looking for something fun to do on the weekend, there's an in-game convention called lunarcon

[0:03:34] <%tuesti> F that's true
[0:03:38] <$KnivesEve> i mean ill have you in the background
[0:03:40] <+Diabetic> I think this may be the time that WoW can't recover
[0:03:41] <%ElkRiverDog> Maybe wait a week?
[0:03:42] <Vantesla> Just bad timing on the trend game BibleThump
[0:03:43] <%NopeBadguy> like it's actually free real estateto stream endwalker
[0:03:43] <Dopamien> at least you enjoy the game EleGiggle
[0:03:45] <%blue8moon> I watched the vods LUL
[0:03:50] <ExpressNode> Thought you said on podcast that you were going on vacation when it released?
[0:03:53] <%goose_attack_almanac> Probably. I would like to see the VoDs but I know it sucks having the rest of your friends zoom ahead of you on the content
[0:03:57] <%Monkeyweed21> SUBMIT TO THE ALGORITHM YOU SWINE
[0:03:58] <Blank9> everyone streams it slow enough for anyone that plays it themselves to pass them up ten times over
[0:04:03] <%NopeBadguy> i also waatched the vods
[0:04:15] <+kewlmyc> The Nier quest is still going?
[0:04:20] <%andrewofbob> The fact that a lot of WoW expats are shopping around kinda accelerates the interest
[0:04:30] <%watts121> Can we see Patron in the Benchmark Pat?
[0:04:36] <Vantesla> @kewlmyc I believe it's permanent
[0:04:37] <%JohnAtDawn> @PatStaresAt You had BETTER stream that story on stream. I'm still pissed you didn't stream 5.3 and 5.5.

[0:05:28] <%JohnAtDawn> 300-400 people is "no one", cool take.
[0:05:37] <%JoshManVGH> No teleport?
[0:05:45] <%chance_h> Perhaps the chat bug was a blessing in disquise
[0:05:46] <jorniev> WHAT is that mount!?
[0:05:48] <%watts121> Prelude in Violet was Stormblood...no one cared before Shadowbringers

[0:07:51] <+MythosDeity> People trying to dictate what Pat plays are so weird. Just enjoy
[0:07:53] <gustavozxd> got my PLD to 80 today, ready for EW
[0:07:55] <%JoshManVGH> Gold plated "jewles" seems like a hell of a scam.
[0:08:08] <Madinki> It's very simple. Big View Number? STREAM. Small View Number? NO STREAM.
[0:08:12] <%ElkRiverDog> Real talk do what's best for you and your channel. You've been doing this 10+ years so you definitely know what you're doing
[0:08:19] <TheBlixster> the rain makes these camera shots better
[0:08:24] <tanarath> @skittlesoul it's.... got ok storytelling, but no open world & combat is just rtb-based. big disappointment even though it's ok

[0:09:59] <%shurtal> it's time for a potato famine
[0:10:03] <%BlackStarAura> He;s losing his shit
[0:10:04] <$realm_forge> Wow it’s me in high school
[0:10:09] <Vantesla> @retrocop87 If Yoko Taro is able to keep making games for a few more decades. We might actually see a "happy" ending LUL

[0:11:11] <dethsenvoy01> hey new fan of the super beast boys here. is it better to support them here on twitch or to on YouTube? cause I like to leave the LP YouTube play in the background but if it's better to use the twitch feed I'd rather do that.
[0:11:17] <gustavozxd> @MikeNized this game in general looks really good considering it was a ps3 game at the start
[0:11:17] <%JoshManVGH> Join us...
[0:11:19] <%Vyskus> I don't trust like that
[0:11:20] <$KnivesEve> uhhhh

[0:11:33] <%walternatorz> STATS TIME
[0:11:42] <MikeNized> @gustavozxd I would slightly argue but I'm not too picky regarding graphics, tbh.
[0:11:43] <%RetroCop87> better than Picarto
[0:11:45] <jorniev> WOAH
[0:11:46] <tanarath> @skittlesoul getting super rare characters is not bad for gacha, but hard.
[0:11:47] <$realm_forge> Did he just die?
[0:11:48] <%JoshManVGH> oh...
[0:11:49] <+shadowsvrse> hey pat why do you hate your own ppl in ff14? potatoes are cool.
[0:11:49] <%rumtumtugnutz> Aw, those taters were in love

[0:11:53] <Madinki> @dethsenvoy01 Wooile likes to be the cool tweiner.
[0:11:54] <%JoshManVGH> oh no...

[0:12:03] <%RetroCop87> damn
[0:12:03] <%BlackStarAura> Is he dead?
[0:12:12] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Why?
[0:12:12] <%chance_h> people really liked Anogg
[0:12:17] <%RetroCop87> how is that not orchestrated!?
[0:12:18] <AllenDeadman> yeah
[0:12:19] <%walternatorz> It's data center specific
[0:12:21] <AllenDeadman> checks out
[0:12:23] <jorniev> SIDED with him on what?
[0:12:25] <%dethsenvoy01> dethsenvoy01 subscribed at Tier 1. 
[0:12:26] <%Puhff> ?wait what
[0:12:28] <%NopeBadguy> anogg got the better choice
[0:12:28] <tanarath> BUT, there are some less rare versions of them, so eh? Dunno if it's p2w eventually
[0:12:29] <%walternatorz> isn't there one that's reverse?
[0:12:30] <+Dradugun> that is bizzare
[0:12:39] <%Ziegsy> Yeah! Im part of the 32!
[0:12:42] <%baronblank> the percentage is so specific it almost makes me think they used certain weird data choices to make it seem closer
[0:12:42] <+JustToWatch> that is bizarrely consistent
[0:12:42] <%ssjklyco> It's weirdly persice
[0:12:43] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt man we really let these kids down
[0:12:44] <%watts121> I don't even remember what the choice was
[0:12:44] <%dethsenvoy01> sweet! now I'm gonna get into ff14 once the servers let me
[0:12:47] <gustavozxd> I was barely paying attention to the dialogue at the start
[0:12:49] <%Mr_Pylon> ... I completely forget what that is
[0:12:54] <%Puhff> ...what?
[0:12:54] <MikeNized> I went with Konogg, personally. I just prefer a calm personality over an energitic one.
[0:12:55] <jorniev> you think thats why they killed the other?
[0:12:58] <gustavozxd> I had no Idea wtf was going on by the first raid, kinda bored
[0:13:00] <%Monkeyweed21> CHAOS
[0:13:00] <+BigCoffee> It was so the same people at S-E assumed there was a bug in the stats when they collected them.
[0:13:00] <%Ipsenscastle> i forget what it was
[0:13:02] <%RetroCop87> waiting for that one server
[0:13:05] <%JoshManVGH> What's the payoff of the choice?
[0:13:05] <AllenDeadman> Anogg is just right
[0:13:07] <%ssjklyco> CHAOS
[0:13:12] <jorniev> NICE
[0:13:13] <%Ipsenscastle> is that important?
[0:13:14] <%Vyskus> I mean that's fair
[0:13:14] <Madinki> Woolie likes to be the cool tweener that plays both sides of YT and Twitch. I'm surprised it's lasted this long
[0:13:15] <funkerbuster> this was before the puppet’s bunker reveal
[0:13:16] <%ElkRiverDog> Apparently it determined what "ending" the raid got
[0:13:18] <%NopeBadguy> no, anogg was guns blazing
[0:13:19] <%baronblank> wait I thought anogg was more blazing
[0:13:19] <%weissguard> Nice
[0:13:21] <%watts121> Eyy Lich/Odin/Phoenix/Shiva got it going on!
[0:13:24] <%Puhff> 69!!!!!!]
[0:13:25] <%Rumbutt> I was so pissed Ultros didn't get 69%
[0:13:26] <%Arweynn> that's wierd
[0:13:27] <MikeNized> But, yeah, they did ask Yoko if ending would be different if they sided on the other side and he was like "we'll never know.".
[0:13:27] <%chance_h> gotta look up the fight before you queue yo
[0:13:29] <gustavozxd> full on 69 data center
[0:13:33] <+c4llmesnuggles> im a new player, 53 dragoon, should i just be powering through main storyline or is there side content i should be touching
[0:13:39] <%RetroCop87> ENDING E CONTINUATION CONFIRMED
[0:13:39] <%JoshManVGH> Ooooh, neat
[0:13:47] <%baronblank> the 65% was guns blazing, the 35% was less guns blazing
[0:13:48] <+BigCoffee> You think they made the story based on those choices??
[0:13:52] <%walternatorz> yup
[0:13:53] <%NopeBadguy> guess we'll never see the konogg story
[0:13:53] <funkerbuster> Choice was before we knew about 2P
[0:13:58] <%Ziegsy> The neir raids were added to new game plus pat. you know what that means
[0:14:02] <%Puhff> did she really come back or are they dead?
[0:14:02] <%watts121> @c4llmesnuggles MSQ>Everything else unless you got friends who wanna do other things
[0:14:06] <yourliteraldog> How did we see that
[0:14:10] <%chance_h> Main story is the better part, side stories can always be done later for the most part
[0:14:15] <jorniev> REALLY that kinda crazy, did they tell the people the ending was gonna change?
[0:14:15] <%walternatorz> think you can go back to the npc
[0:14:15] <MikeNized> Here's the thing, I was wondering if it was a matter of "is it just the first choice?" because, that's a thing ,right?
[0:14:21] <gustavozxd> @c4llmesnuggles crystal tower, the ARR alliance raid, is the only one you SHOULD do, everything else is mostly so you can have it unlocked
[0:14:25] <MikeNized> But, no, because you have to select them.
[0:14:26] <%IDTheftVictim> IDTheftVictim subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 32 months! It is no exaggeration or hyperbole that all evils of the world are endorsed, and committed, by Lalafell.
[0:14:27] <%watts121> @c4llmesnuggles it's easier to do things at max level then it is to do them at your current level
[0:14:28] <MikeNized> Also, yes, that's it.
[0:14:31] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt man we REALLY let these kids down
[0:14:33] <+c4llmesnuggles> @watts121 okie dokie
[0:14:38] <All_Salt> I bet people were more likely to pick caution for the simple reason that the know Yoko Taro's writing.
[0:14:43] <MikeNized> __Revelations.__
[0:14:48] <%chance_h> @IDTheftVictim Facts
[0:14:48] <MikeNized> Yoko Taro Style.
[0:14:53] <%Monkeyweed21> they ran into some hungry Irishmen and were never seen again
[0:14:59] <%RetroCop87> @PatStaresAt In the gacha bullshit Nier game, 2P's lore explicitly references the FF14 raid story
[0:15:01] <gustavozxd> man that's a cool fucking mount
[0:15:06] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt anogg was guns blazing, konogg was cautio
[0:15:17] <MikeNized> @RetroCop87 Oh, do they?
[0:15:18] <%Rumbutt> I picked guns blazing because I wanted to be a contrarian bitch
[0:15:18] <gustavozxd> YES
[0:15:22] <jorniev> WELP... that was depressing, GOOD JOB TARO
[0:15:23] <%NopeBadguy> FOR MORE MONEY
[0:15:23] <%Mr_Pylon> YES
[0:15:23] <gustavozxd> I LOVE IT
[0:15:23] <+BigCoffee> It sucks
[0:15:24] <yourliteraldog> Money
[0:15:24] <Zebroneath> Cause MONEY
[0:15:24] <%cvp5127> money LUL
[0:15:26] <$SGrim> based taro
[0:15:26] <+kewlmyc> Yes, it's so Square can make money off of it
[0:15:26] <DianaTheAscian> its a shame that games a gacha
[0:15:27] <AllenDeadman> yeah
[0:15:28] <%Ziegsy> I picked guns blaze because i was playing with people who made the other choice
[0:15:29] <+Kenzo2000> Gotta get paid
[0:15:32] <%chance_h> to give square money
[0:15:32] <%Ziegsy> we scienced
[0:15:36] <%baronblank> the more picked one, konogg, was more about caution
[0:15:37] <jorniev> GIVE US MONEY
[0:15:39] <GamerWorlock> lmao
[0:15:39] <+BigCoffee> It makes me not give a fuck about re-incarnation now
[0:15:39] <MikeNized> Anogg is not the caution.
[0:15:39] <AllenDeadman> he is right
[0:15:40] <Vantesla> LUL
[0:15:42] <%General_Terro> true LUL
[0:15:42] <%baronblank> er
[0:15:47] <%ssjklyco> Brutal honesty
[0:15:49] <funkerbuster> True dat
[0:15:50] <AllenDeadman> I mean, WHY ELSE??
[0:15:51] <%cvp5127> based taro
[0:15:51] <ExpressNode> Something we already knew but with a voice behind it
[0:15:53] <tanarath> Yoko taro keeping it real
[0:15:54] <RaidenRising> give that genshin money
[0:15:55] <%baronblank> I just said something super wrong lol
[0:15:58] <%MoonKing> Nier lore is entirely driven by money and it's great
[0:15:58] <%ElkRiverDog> Well at least he's being honest
[0:16:02] <%chance_h> tbh Yoko just hits a random word generator for most of his lore
[0:16:05] <$SGrim> but more crossover porn will happen now, so big win
[0:16:06] <Ids560> that's fair
[0:16:10] <%Vyskus> I mean, how many final fantasy gacha games are there???? like five??????
[0:16:10] <yourliteraldog> I tried playing it on bluestacks runs like shit
[0:16:11] <gustavozxd> I'm enjoying everything that is not gameplay related in reincarnation
[0:16:20] <+Kenzo2000> !uptime
[0:16:21] <@Moobot> @Kenzo2000 I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 16m 40s.
[0:16:25] <gustavozxd> @Vyskus one died, Mobius
[0:16:30] <%BigChiefBear> Do you even need MGP anymore? you look like youve done everything
[0:16:39] <%ElkRiverDog> Do we have any idea what the Anogg ending looks like, if it even exists?
[0:16:53] <AllenDeadman> he is goooone
[0:16:54] <%NopeBadguy> i miss him
[0:16:59] <%watts121> Can we see your toon in the Benchmark?
[0:16:59] <Blank9> who doesn't want more mgp in case some new 20 million mgp mount shows up?
[0:17:25] <AllenDeadman> why did the dwarves get all the yoko taro writing?
[0:17:25] <MikeNized> Yeah, we'll never know about the MGP, yé.
[0:17:30] <tanarath> biiiiig depression
[0:17:37] <%NopeBadguy> i can't get over how much we let those twins down NotLikeThis
[0:17:38] <AllenDeadman> ALL of it
[0:17:44] <%Ziegsy> @Blank9 they said they wont do that again but.. I dunno
[0:17:46] <MikeNized> At the same time, I just like simple mounts so I don't have quite the drive to farm, haha.
[0:17:49] <Zebroneath> yay, depression
[0:17:50] <+BigCoffee> I just think that Anogg went insane and killed himself, and hallucinated his sister coming back
[0:17:54] <%IDTheftVictim> YokoTaro likes making cute things sad and depressing
[0:17:55] <jorniev> i hope he does like a drakengard thing for ff14, like a CAIM raid boss
[0:18:00] <%JoshManVGH> Weight of The World Instrumental is a good get
[0:18:05] <%NopeBadguy> just look in your achievement page, dude
[0:18:09] <%walternatorz> recent achievements?
[0:18:13] <gustavozxd> can't you find it in the achievments list?
[0:18:50] <$SGrim> bye bye patti
[0:18:52] <+BigCoffee> Back to ignoring FF until november?
[0:18:56] <%Puhff> night night
[0:18:57] <gustavozxd> oh god look at all the white gear
[0:18:58] <rei0> o shit it's ffxiv! yay
[0:19:00] <%IDTheftVictim> Go sleep in a bed and not in the street like a bum
[0:19:01] <Blank9> All I want from Endwalker is a fight against the Four Fiends from FF4, where Rubicante shows up at the end and uses healer LB3 on your party before fighting you.
[0:19:05] <jorniev> imagine killing alternate universe caim
[0:19:10] <jorniev> in ff14
[0:19:11] <%NopeBadguy> yo HOUSE TOUR
[0:19:12] <gustavozxd> any reason to not extract materia?
[0:19:15] <2Bs_USB_port> damn
[0:19:20] <2Bs_USB_port> nice house
[0:19:21] <gustavozxd> oh man this fucking song atpDance
[0:19:22] <%Puhff> LESGOOO
[0:19:26] <+BigCoffee> the house looks like na office
[0:19:27] <%weissguard> Nice
[0:19:27] <%Rumbutt> god Porpoise kills it with the decor
[0:19:28] <%JoshManVGH> That's still a damn nice house
[0:19:28] <+pyurient> Nice RE1 mansion
[0:19:29] <jorniev> YOU GOT A HOUSE?
[0:19:32] <gustavozxd> still the best one out of the entire raid series
[0:19:32] <+Kenzo2000> MTV Cribs
[0:19:37] <jorniev> isnt that like hard
[0:19:37] <%IDTheftVictim> This house doesn't look like it was fitted for you
[0:19:37] <MikeNized> A all-lot of nothing from that post-NieR content.
[0:19:38] <chancho4tierra> too busy
[0:19:42] <%snugglepuggs> Just rejoining. Did Pat finish ME2 DLC?
[0:19:43] <%NopeBadguy> it's very compact
[0:19:47] <%NopeBadguy> you can barely fit
[0:19:51] <%chance_h> good job everyone, time to tuck the potatos in for the night to prevent them from committing more violence
[0:19:55] <%ElkRiverDog> Hey, @PatStaresAt, is Crystal still a RP Gatekeeper nightmare? Most of the other servers are full,, apparently
[0:19:56] <%LeiaSkynoober> @snugglepuggs Yeah
[0:19:57] <MikeNized> I personally prefer Ivalice in term of mechanics?
[0:19:58] <$StrawberryPantsu> Bye Bye PS4 Support
[0:20:02] <%JoshManVGH> Ooh does that mean a floor two?
[0:20:04] <MikeNized> I also really like Orbonne.

[0:20:26] <All_Salt> @gustavozxd Only if you can trade armour/weapon it into a grand company for company seals.
[0:20:30] <%Puhff> @ElkRiverDog not a nightmare. SuperButterBuns is one Crystal and doesnt RP at all

[0:20:47] <%notsoy> nah, they were riddled with sex pests the entire time, don't you worry

[0:21:40] <gustavozxd> I got curious seeing u were playing 14
[0:21:43] <+IDontH8Vestz89> Thanks Elmo!
[0:21:43] <gustavozxd> NO
[0:21:48] <gustavozxd> BAD INFLUENCE
[0:21:49] <%Ziegsy> In the weightlifting world, a prolapse is called 'red socking it'
[0:21:51] <gustavozxd> DON'T GET SCAMMED
[0:21:57] <%baka_sugoi> GATTCHA
[0:22:01] <%NopeBadguy> do you not spend money on runeterra shit?
[0:22:03] <$SGrim> but the PORN
[0:22:13] <%Zeif00> Knowing you're susceptible is great
[0:22:14] <DracaenaLeaf> Get all the 5 Stars :) Kappa
[0:22:18] <Blank9> genshin falls apart after you're done with exploration
[0:22:20] <%chance_h> sweet, really needed that
[0:22:21] <Vantesla> I'll take Yoko advice and avoid Reincarnation.
[0:22:28] <gustavozxd> Reincarnation is kinda interesting so far ignoring all the gatcha related crap garbage trash
[0:22:30] <$StrawberryPantsu> Oooof
[0:22:30] <+JustToWatch> I can do Genshin by just doing the battle pass and treating it like a subscription
[0:22:32] <Blank9> the grind is ludicrous and required
[0:22:41] <%RetroCop87> Pat,watch youtube story compilations when they're out. The game is a gacha for sure, but the story is also very much a Yoko Taro joint
[0:22:45] <Vantesla> check that sht though
[0:22:56] <gustavozxd> yeah genshin is insanely repetitive
[0:23:07] <DianaTheAscian> I can only handle 1 gacha
[0:23:21] <RushUnplugged> EMLO
[0:23:22] <+Kenzo2000> boy
[0:23:26] <%Mr_Pylon> emlo
[0:23:32] <theanora1> I can't believe your C-pap is giving you the old spicy lung
[0:23:39] <+polothegreatest> DxCat
[0:23:46] <rReizs> play ffxiv big fishing, the biggest, meanest gacha of all
[0:23:58] <%chance_h> i wish they would translate the horse girl gatcha game but instead they just keep giving us anime versions only :(
[0:24:09] <%SaiyanShoto> He so pretty
[0:24:27] <AllenDeadman> a shame indeed
[0:24:31] <gustavozxd> weird that mass effect 3 never came out huh
[0:24:52] <%NopeBadguy> tbh, everytime i see a cute genshin girl, i get tempted
[0:24:55] <%NopeBadguy> but i'm also broke
[0:25:09] <%chance_h> at least we got that fan made game called andomeda
[0:25:11] <+JustToWatch> what
[0:25:13] <All_Salt> Dang, pat. Too bad more people don't watch your ffxiv streams.
