Hey Pat, just started getting into FF14 after going off and on for like a year. Never played an MMO, but is the main appeal just levelling your classes and getting HUGE? Not that I mind. Just find the early game sorta of a slog. Any tips?

[0:04:04] <%Treasure_Vault> I like knowing when, but who cares what
[0:04:05] <+kewlmyc> I like it
[0:04:05] <+Ches_Neckbeard> schedules are nice
[0:04:06] <%BoxNavy> no
[0:04:07] <%blaccbird914> yes
[0:04:07] <%Gogogolem> yes.
[0:04:08] <M0untain_wolf> Yes
[0:04:09] <Zooperton> nope
[0:04:09] <%CatastropheCorvid> Super important.
[0:04:09] <%HaroldDonchee> I like it a lot
[0:04:10] <thekingjanglesbible> It is nice to have a schedule
[0:04:10] <+coffeebearCafe> schedule good
[0:04:10] <%Mr_Pylon> Schedule is nice
[0:04:10] <Mattais88> very
[0:04:11] <$Ziegsy> i care
[0:04:11] <%NateyBeak> i kinda like the schedule honestly
[0:04:11] <tanarath> Schedules are nice
[0:04:11] <%LeiaSkynoober> Yes I care
[0:04:11] <%TheDullaMAN> A schedule keeps you on point.
[0:04:12] <+Smokebanshee> schedule good
[0:04:12] <%KeiganOfAstora> It's really important
[0:04:12] <%Gogogolem> Big care
[0:04:12] <%Peculiaryordle> huge care
[0:04:13] <NPG_Eseph> im too adhd to schedule
[0:04:13] <Madinki> I do not care
[0:04:14] <%TheWinged7> i like the time slot, the game less important
[0:04:14] <+trizetacannon44> I care
[0:04:14] <+zaitje> eh
[0:04:15] <KaiserMario> I care
[0:04:15] <%AzureGale> Schedules are cool
[0:04:16] <psidefx> I Like it
[0:04:16] <+AFellowDegen> no
[0:04:16] <%patriotrenegade> yes??
[0:04:17] <%Ynkubus_> semi important
[0:04:17] <%sabertoothzombie> YES
[0:04:17] <%Tman451> I like knowing when more than anything
[0:04:17] <+Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> like a stream schedule or life schedule @PatStaresAt
[0:04:18] <%Lefanque> Yes please schededule
[0:04:19] <%Buzzard42> what is "planning"
[0:04:20] <%emperordread> It's a nice to have, but I don't care much
[0:04:20] <BliVru> Is alright
[0:04:20] <%weissguard> Plz keep them
[0:04:20] <$KnivesEve> meh
[0:04:20] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt a schedule is a prediction
[0:04:20] <BigFingerRo> I don't give a single shit about what is played as long as it's in the same time slot
[0:04:21] <+rafaelba93> dont mind
[0:04:21] <Jetsfantasy> I like planning ahead
[0:04:22] <%WhereIsWill> I like knowing but it aint that deep
[0:04:22] <+Peacefrog7> a little but good to be flexible
[0:04:23] <Profmcstevie> If you had no schedule it'd piss me off
[0:04:23] <%ahomeschooldropout> I like it for entire playthroughs, but I don't care for one offs
[0:04:23] <%BoxNavy> schedules for streamers is vital though otherwise i dont watch
[0:04:24] <DXLelouch24> Yes
[0:04:24] <majindusto> I CARE
[0:04:24] <BlockingDisabled> Big YES
[0:04:27] <AoiRob> i like knowing which games what day
[0:04:27] <%doomunderthestairs> I mean with my life yeah but I just kinda jump in and see who is on
[0:04:28] <%LeiaSkynoober> I love tuning in and I try to be here all the time
[0:04:28] <dekkitout> Personally alot, since I will hold up other people's time
[0:04:30] <%AzureGale> This seems like a good time for a poll
[0:04:30] <thekingjanglesbible> too many moving parts in life without a schedule anyway
[0:04:33] <$sleepystardewfarmer> I do not care much
[0:04:34] <%BoxNavy> SourPls
[0:04:39] <DXLelouch24> I plan around it Pat
[0:04:40] <GuyverTypeL> Do YOU care tho? A schedule seems important for streamers
[0:04:41] <PinionGear> its doesn't matter to me
[0:04:42] <M0untain_wolf> But Chaos !
[0:04:44] <Profmcstevie> It's almost like TV had value in at least being consistent in schedule
[0:04:47] <+AFellowDegen> If I planned my life around your streams a schedule would be good but
[0:04:49] <+Shady_Zaku> AYYY streams back!
[0:04:50] <%AzureGale> nyannMegalul
[0:04:53] <M0untain_wolf> Chaos always rule
[0:04:57] <fugly_nick> It's nice to have a schedule, but it's not a big deal if things get changed or moved around
[0:05:02] <+kewlmyc> He's a god.
[0:05:04] <Jontman42> if the stream appears at random then I'll also watch it at random and probably miss most of them
[0:05:05] <%emperordread> I hate every ape I see, from Chimpan-a to Chimpan-z
[0:05:06] <AstrodropGaming> Embrace Chaos Pat
[0:05:08] <+coffeebearCafe> schedule good unless you stream like Max lol
[0:05:08] <dekkitout> "Is Wayne Brady about to kill a bitch?"
[0:05:10] <TrollKing96> How well would Kubrick do as a game dev?
[0:05:13] <+Shady_Zaku> Cause Who's Line rocks and he's awesome
[0:05:20] <Eightesu> having a structured schedule is important to healthy mentality!
[0:05:23] <Jathspuh> Braydeez nuts
[0:05:25] <+Shady_Zaku> oh god the Chappell show lmao
[0:05:25] <dekkitout> Yes
[0:05:27] <TYBGerritt> He says its Bryant Gumbel
[0:05:28] <%doomunderthestairs> brian gumble
[0:05:30] <Maids4lyfe> why aren't we talking about wayne brady
[0:05:30] <%AzureGale> "Things you say that will always start a fight."
[0:05:31] <dekkitout> That was the quote
[0:05:33] <BigFingerRo> @emperordread Sounds to me like you need a second opinion!
[0:05:34] <+Shady_Zaku> that bit was nuts
[0:05:35] <+Ches_Neckbeard> makes Bryant Gumble look like Maclom X. Bryant Gumble is a sports caster
[0:05:36] <TYBGerritt> That Wayne Brady makes look like Malcom X
[0:05:42] <%CollinsOfBodom> brine gumball
[0:05:43] <TYBGerritt> American Politics
[0:05:47] <Krash_Override> Wayne Brady is in the new Cuphead Cartoon
[0:05:48] <fugly_nick> Oh no
[0:05:49] <Laecerelius> He's a reporter
[0:05:50] <fugly_nick> Not again
[0:05:54] <+Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> TRUE
[0:05:59] <Maids4lyfe> bryant gumble is a black news reporter
[0:06:00] <pi_in_the_sci> He's the Black host of Goodmoring America
[0:06:00] <%doomunderthestairs> he was a sportscaster
[0:06:00] <+RobbedGamer> Agreed
[0:06:01] <Eightesu> we do indeed
[0:06:04] <penitentpendant> Yeah, and they keep messin' up the joint
[0:06:05] <+Ches_Neckbeard> Bryant Gumble is a sports caster not politician. What?
[0:06:05] <+ScrapKingKeita> Brian Gumballs in yer mouth haha gottem
[0:06:06] <KnightOfTrousers> It's cause we have too many damn issues

[0:06:20] <fugly_nick> Oh god my video lagged and I thought the stream crashed again
[0:06:20] <Maids4lyfe> no
[0:06:20] <Jontman42> there's just too many Americans
[0:06:21] <%Dakuu75> HAS TO BE AN EVEN NUMBER
[0:06:22] <%Gogogolem> we've been trying to get rid of ohio for years.
[0:06:24] <M0untain_wolf> MORE STATES
[0:06:24] <%Treasure_Vault> CENTRAL
[0:06:27] <+rafaelba93> get rid of half

[0:06:32] <Eightesu> we have 50 it's perfect
[0:06:32] <dekkitout> Honestly we do, but tweaking our state borders would have to be based on water tables and it would suck
[0:06:33] <$Ziegsy> 'farm state'
[0:06:35] <%MechArch> like your pants
[0:06:35] <%barrakuta371> The middle part that Paige is from?
[0:06:35] <+mgoodinthehood> The Plague part
[0:06:36] <%ahomeschooldropout> US is weird 'cause every State is like it's on country
[0:06:36] <Eightesu> perfect balance
[0:06:37] <KaiserMario> That middle part is where Rich Evans lives tho @PatStaresAt
[0:06:39] <%patriotrenegade> ha ha no thatll end in a civil war i guarantee you
[0:06:40] <thekingjanglesbible> Give one to the other
[0:06:40] <%Tman451> We want to trade Texas for Puerto Rico
[0:06:42] <Profmcstevie> There's already central, west, east and south
[0:06:43] <+Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> If it weren't 50 OCD would be an epidemic
[0:06:44] <%Dakuu75> hell yeah
[0:06:45] <DanThePumpkinman> left, right, up middle and down middle
[0:06:49] <insomniac_doze_> whip run Pog
[0:06:53] <Too_Much_Nukie> I took a shower, did Pat beat Dancer or give up again?

[0:06:54] <%SirGO0SE> new countries PogChamp
[0:06:55] <Profmcstevie> ......wait why does the USA not have a considered "north"
[0:06:57] <+RobbedGamer> I grew up in the smelly part
[0:06:59] <ZaCrimsonDragon> so California, Loser Coast, the middle, and then Texas
[0:07:01] <Jetsfantasy> We need super dekota and super carolina
[0:07:02] <%Romuken> wut
[0:07:03] <%whyskeywolfe> The Plague part, the Paige part, the Rich Evans part and the rest.
[0:07:07] <+Nautilus_Bot> Hey! I live in that middle part! It does smell but it smells like horse shit and bourbon
[0:07:13] <+Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> Skyrim HATES it
[0:07:21] <%ahomeschooldropout> UNITED CITIES OF AMERICA
[0:07:22] <dekkitout> @Profmcstevie We do, we have a notheast and northwest
[0:07:23] <NPG_Eseph> canada can have alaska and i guess we should just decolonize hawaii
[0:07:26] <anAngryHamster> Hawaiian independence back on the menu
[0:07:27] <Profmcstevie> Older they are for sure, especially non PC
[0:07:28] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> re: alaska and hawaii, based
[0:07:32] <Jetsfantasy> I've got a high refresh monitor, I know how it is
[0:07:38] <TrollKing96> @PatStaresAt How well would Kubrick do as a game dev?
[0:07:42] <%CatastropheCorvid> Anything running Havok, because Havok ties physics to FPS.
[0:07:48] <+the_drummaestro> does this mod change bosses?
[0:07:54] <%Tman451> ???
[0:08:04] <%BoxNavy> NotLikeThis
[0:08:09] <M0untain_wolf> sound is at 60fps
[0:08:10] <%Tman451> Thats a big fucky
[0:08:13] <DanThePumpkinman> get a better tv lol
[0:08:14] <+Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> sbfpSetIn
[0:08:14] <%CatastropheCorvid> Havok is why DS, Skyrim, Fallout titles all futz up when run at higher than 60.
[0:08:16] <%KeiganOfAstora> NERD!!!
[0:08:19] <+roronoapedro> NotLikeThis
[0:08:21] <$Ziegsy> those are some words
[0:08:22] <Jetsfantasy> Weird
[0:08:37] <Profmcstevie> Do not speak these ancient, cursed terms at me
[0:08:41] <Robot_Ridley> the human ear can't hear more than 60fps
[0:08:41] <majindusto> THATS A HUGE RAT enigmaS
[0:08:42] <NPG_Eseph> lets be real tho, if hawaii got independance the CIA would option select directly into sabatoging the absolute fuck out of their economy
[0:08:45] <Shirousuke1989> We need to turn Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, PEI and Quebec's Penis into one province first.
[0:08:46] <+NightNiix> the sound is weird tho
[0:08:48] <KaiserMario> Man, new tvs suck, we should just get crts back
[0:08:49] <+FreeWalker312> Man you call this Call of Duty?
[0:08:52] <+Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> lotta mimics
[0:08:57] <%KeiganOfAstora> @Ziegsy This is a correct statement
[0:09:07] <ZaCrimsonDragon> But pat, can that rat swim?
[0:09:08] <%BoxNavy> chains away have a nice day lionNice
[0:09:09] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> I think that's your old chipset. I have no problems with that and all my parts are new.
[0:09:12] <Profmcstevie> Borderless windowed has saved gaming
[0:09:19] <+UltraViolet371> @majindusto an emote user of culture? enigmaHmm
[0:09:35] <Zooperton> I just smack it, it's foolproof and quick LUL
[0:09:37] <%BoxNavy> just hit the little freak
[0:09:38] <%Dakuu75> I just swing at every chest
[0:09:42] <+Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> LUL
[0:09:45] <Maids4lyfe> you can also just smack it once
[0:09:46] <%Frost_Quill> I hope this mod breaks that trope and the wrong chain is on the mimic ones sometimes.
[0:09:46] <+fetrigon> ds2
[0:09:48] <Profmcstevie> If it breathes we can kill it~
[0:09:50] <fugly_nick> It's harder to tell in DS2
[0:09:50] <+fetrigon> LUL
[0:09:55] <+Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> yeah
[0:09:56] <ll_J_A_C_K_ll> hit it with MAGIC
[0:09:59] <ll_J_A_C_K_ll> ONE HIT
[0:10:00] <DrkJP520> I remember breaking the regen ring you get early on in DS2
[0:10:00] <%WhereIsWill> it really did
[0:10:01] <GuyverTypeL> oof
[0:10:20] <Profmcstevie> In a game as relentless with autosaves with Dark Souls too
[0:10:23] <AoiRob> mimics in DS2 have locks on them
[0:10:23] <ll_J_A_C_K_ll> what it sucked ?
[0:10:31] <+coffeebearCafe> ds2 is bad lol
[0:10:31] <Zooperton> it has cool stuff :(
[0:10:34] <%Frost_Quill> DS2 had the best PVP.
[0:10:37] <%doomunderthestairs> its why I never went back to Ds2
[0:10:37] <thekingjanglesbible> I dunno, it's definitely got its own mood going on
[0:10:40] <blackmageslowpoke> DS2 maintains the best pvp by far
[0:10:41] <Jontman42> ds2 is good
[0:10:42] <+Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> the unicorns of Fuck Valley are really the lowest point of DS2 for me
[0:10:42] <KaiserMario> DS2 still has some fun unique stuff
[0:10:43] <dK_kay> i liked the dlc
[0:10:47] <%ahomeschooldropout> yes
[0:10:48] <+Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> ye

[0:11:20] <comicalmond9135> not like theres any new games to play
[0:11:21] <+kullumanati> New games please
[0:11:23] <%barrakuta371> I would like more Mass Effect, but I'm interested in Death Trash too
[0:11:25] <%AFellowDegen> @Thyzoon Thanks for the gift sub!
[0:11:25] <%Broand> I played the forgotten city mod and it was solid
[0:11:26] <PinionGear> cinders is cool
[0:11:26] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt How long before Cinders includes portals to both 1 and 2 in it
[0:11:27] <digaogrunge> DEATH TRASH looks dope
[0:11:28] <Profmcstevie> It's been a good few weeks for game releases
[0:11:28] <Shirousuke1989> You're going to stream Elden Ring when it comes out right?
[0:11:29] <BigYanno> I've been playing cinders recently and it crashes pretty often.
[0:11:31] <+rafaelba93> i like cinders but any of those are great
[0:11:34] <+matt_mcgrump> Rime is very good
[0:11:35] <HirsuteBrute> defs more mass effect, as much as I enjoy these cinders streams
[0:11:41] <anAngryHamster> The RPG part of DS2 was more refined than any Miyazaki game
[0:11:42] <Wydamn> I really like everything about death trash but the dialogue/writing could be better.
[0:11:46] <fugly_nick> @QueequegTheater I feel like this is the ultimate endgoal of the mod
[0:11:59] <KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt Could you do a week of VanillaWare sometime?
[0:12:02] <%BakiinPlaysStuff> @patstaresat any plans on checking out that Outer Wilds DLC when it comes out?
[0:12:06] <dekkitout> "Keep your whore mouth shut or we feed you to the kraken"
[0:12:06] <robosqueeb> yeah it does!
[0:12:19] <Profmcstevie> It's got that GOOD grime
[0:12:22] <%BoxNavy> its going to be fuck
[0:12:26] <Profmcstevie> But not Grime, that is good too though
[0:12:40] <robosqueeb> plus your vomit powers machines
[0:12:45] <Jontman42> aww yeah that genesis filth
[0:12:49] <%QueequegTheater> "If you say a thing we WILL feed you to the David Cage clone in our basement"
[0:12:50] <Profmcstevie> My favourite aesthetic is polished garbage
[0:12:51] <%Treuan> More like sigma grimeset
[0:12:53] <Wydamn> Death Trash makes me think of the best parts of Mother Horse Eyes
[0:13:00] <AoiRob> @PatStaresAt you should wait for Grime to be patched a bit fyi. i've gotten stuck on menus and shit
[0:13:02] <dekkitout> If grime was a writhing mass of sentient flesh, it'd be Death Trash
[0:13:03] <+RobbedGamer> Yeah but I hear grime doesn't pay. Kappa
[0:13:05] <Zooperton> kinda reminds me of darkwood but meat instead of trees
[0:13:10] <%Treasure_Vault> @BakiinPlaysStuff Oh no I thought you meant Outer Worlds. I will never get those two right.
[0:13:15] <%CollinsOfBodom> Speaking of Genesis, how about one of the Shining Forces?
[0:13:19] <fugly_nick> That's pretty good
[0:13:21] <%WhereIsWill> psaBlind psaBlind psaBlind
[0:13:25] <KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt Missed item, under table
[0:13:29] <Profmcstevie> Honestly it's excellently realized garbage feel reminds me of Oddworld games
[0:13:37] <%doomunderthestairs> ohhhhh would love to see ya play shining force
[0:13:39] <%ForlornCarton> under table
[0:13:44] <Wydamn> Treasure_Vault, I just found out that one of the people from Outer Wilds also worked on some of the Outer Worlds DLC
[0:13:46] <%BoxNavy> no
[0:13:47] <KaiserMario> blindness
[0:14:07] <Profmcstevie> Recompile comes out in a few weeks, I'm PUMPED for Recompile
[0:14:09] <%whyskeywolfe> When's that Outer Wilds expansion coming out?
[0:14:10] <BliVru> Did you know that Forgotten City was a Skhrim mod?
[0:14:11] <%Treasure_Vault> That's too much, man.
[0:14:11] <M0untain_wolf> Its free
[0:14:24] <Wydamn> whyskeywolfe, september 28 or 29 i think
[0:14:24] <dekkitout> Like Endreal
[0:14:28] <%AnIcedCoffee> AnIcedCoffee subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 27 months! 
[0:14:39] <TrollKing96> Has there ever been a game that benefited from a stealth release?
[0:14:48] <AoiRob> @PatStaresAt hey what do you think about Outer Wilds Echoes of the Eye?
[0:14:50] <KaiserMario> I miss Poopchalk, the hero
[0:14:50] <%CatastropheCorvid> Forgotten city? Wasn't that the Dwarven City mod with the timeloop?
[0:15:02] <%whyskeywolfe> @wydamn Good man.
[0:15:02] <%QueequegTheater> STOP! YOU'VE VIOLATED THE LAW!
[0:15:04] <Profmcstevie> You could crack open Forgotten City and find the Dragonborn staring back at you
[0:15:11] <Zombrocom> Apex kinda had a stealth release and that worked out for them
[0:15:18] <%Treasure_Vault> Dark Souls is a happy place. Weird, but true.
[0:15:22] <sallbang> psaPorgmo
[0:15:27] <sallbang> Woof
[0:15:28] <%TheDullaMAN> Waow
[0:15:31] <KaiserMario> There
[0:15:34] <+Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> Yeah Dark Souls is stripCozy lawlmanComfy
[0:15:38] <penitentpendant> Dark Souls streams have the 'chat with chat' energy compared to most streams
[0:15:40] <%za7az> Twerk
[0:15:43] <dekkitout> Putting the werk in twerk
[0:15:44] <Mattais88> I wish there was a game I cared about cming out before Metroid

[0:16:00] <Wydamn> "The clap of my ass cheeks keeps alerting the hollows"
[0:16:00] <Too_Much_Nukie> I get most of my embers from giving petrified somethings to the bird.
[0:16:03] <BigFingerRo> I've never heard of motorboating an ass but hey
[0:16:04] <Profmcstevie> When you are comfortable with a game enough it just sits in your subconscious while your conscious relaxes
[0:16:06] <anAngryHamster> Ho dick
[0:16:06] <%AzureGale> F
[0:16:16] <BigFingerRo> don't knock it til you try it!
[0:16:16] <fugly_nick> Let him burn himself to death
[0:16:19] <%BoxNavy> what the hell is that evil ball
[0:16:21] <BlockingDisabled> You can make Embers at a bonfire for 4k souls in 2.04
[0:16:41] <BigFingerRo> Man, I love the idea of the Warmth spell
[0:16:43] <Wydamn> BoxNavy, warmth, it's a vanilla pyromancy.
[0:16:43] <%QueequegTheater> @BlockingDisabled fucking what

[0:17:51] <+Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> that means it was Paige

[0:22:25] <Thyzoon> @PatStaresAt Hey Pat did you hear about the upcoming mod Archthrones for DS3? Looks ambitious. DS3 modding as exploded as of late! Also very much looking forward to DS1 Nightfall
[0:22:25] <%KeiganOfAstora> @PatStaresAt Hey are you gonna watch Suicide Squad? In the same way you "have to" watch Space Jam 2?
[0:22:25] <chhdez> Point and laugh

[0:24:23] <ohkayNiko> as far as trick weapons
[0:24:25] <AoiRob> Champion's Ashes has Trick Weapons with their entire Bloodborne movesets
[0:24:27] <%patriotrenegade> Vawser
[0:24:29] <$Jaxnos> touch the dank
[0:24:29] <fugly_nick> That Champions mod has functional trick weapons right?
[0:24:29] <+Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> Tale of 3 Lordrans
[0:24:34] <Ethel9727> I really want Elden Ring to be Skyrim'd with modders.
[0:24:36] <Questiy> For those who didn't know: It did NOT do that in earlier patches
[0:24:38] <dekkitout> That's a tall ask there
[0:24:39] <+Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> BIG STRETCH
[0:24:42] <cgreene64> Put every Soulsborne game into Elden Ring
[0:24:42] <+the_drummaestro> just mod bloodborn into DS3
[0:24:43] <+BoboDaHobo> get them on the podcast
[0:24:44] <Profmcstevie> Elden Ring is separated by major areas and a hub.....so it'd TOTALLY work
[0:24:45] <Zooperton> elden ring is just all the games jammed together
[0:24:46] <IminyourBase> what if he puts fallout new elden ring vegas
[0:24:48] <+Grago231> TOUCH
[0:24:52] <+TheBitingIrish> Bear Seek Seek Lest
[0:24:53] <%AzureGale> Oh I ah
[0:24:57] <+Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> @PatStaresAt no Elmo did a big stretch lmao
[0:24:59] <%CollinsOfBodom> Elden Ring & Knuckles

[0:25:01] <%Ynkubus_> Imagine if they stuffed in Kings Field stuff for the luls too
[0:25:03] <BigFingerRo> "Hey, check out this dlc" and it's just DS3 in its entiretu
[0:25:11] <SPidERMan8576> The tale of two rings
[0:25:15] <%AzureGale> Hmm how how i ah hmm hmm how I
[0:25:15] <Wydamn> You're allowed to be unreasonable with the things you want, as long as you can recognize when they are unreasonable
[0:25:21] <+Grago231> People made just cause 2 an MMO, honestly modders are insane
[0:25:26] <%AncelDeLambert> what's Pat's build?
[0:25:26] <%muetank> Champions Ashes mod has working Bloodborne trick weapons
[0:25:27] <+Mumbles519> wait what lifegem?
[0:25:27] <+Shoosler> rings die twice
[0:25:34] <+MisterAvry> damn you're fast
[0:25:44] <+Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> Elmo did a BIG good stretch there I wasn't saying it was a stretch to say people would mod the shit outta Elden Ring Pat
[0:25:45] <Mattais88> What would be better, all of Bloodbourne in DS3 or all of DS3 in Bloodbourne?
[0:25:56] <SPidERMan8576> The onion rings
[0:25:58] <%AzureGale> Yes
[0:25:59] <BigYanno> bloodborne in DS3
[0:26:02] <BigFingerRo> I like how these preacher ladies laugh, kinda Pekora-ish
[0:26:03] <BigYanno> cos framerates
[0:26:09] <ChatNinja> so is the uchi just that much better now or are enemies weaker than usual?
[0:26:14] <+Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> LUL

[0:27:27] <%AncelDeLambert> trust us, Paige, don't read Bleach
[0:27:28] <insomniac_doze_> bleach is a joke
[0:27:28] <$Jaxnos> that new chapter was neat
[0:27:29] <+bluedude153> Honestly the chapter was really good. iTs fucked up
[0:27:29] <+coffeebearCafe> its trash
[0:27:30] <+pupil31> LUL
[0:27:31] <%patriotrenegade> BLEACH CHADS KEEP WINNING
[0:27:31] <+Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> MIXED.
[0:27:33] <Profmcstevie> Perhaps you mean Berserk
[0:27:33] <%AFellowDegen> My name is Pat and i'm a BOOMER
[0:27:35] <mr_saturday93> BLESCH DUCKS
[0:27:36] <+TheBitingIrish> doodSad
[0:27:36] <Mattais88> A Final Chapter
[0:27:38] <+Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> The answer is MIXED.
[0:27:38] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt What about those WoW world first raiders who boosted to 70 and are gonna try to do Ultimates
[0:27:39] <Wydamn> WHAT
[0:27:40] <%Gorshum> Wait whaaaat?
[0:27:40] <+Birdigalore> Is Berserk still going
[0:27:40] <%AncelDeLambert> why, is someone working on it?
[0:27:41] <Afterman_> new bleach chapter was super good actually
[0:27:42] <+the_drummaestro> :(
[0:27:43] <BigFingerRo> EXCUSE ME?
[0:27:43] <+pupil31> monkaS
[0:27:43] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Bleach should have ended years ago
[0:27:43] <mr_saturday93> Bleach sucks
[0:27:45] <digaogrunge> FUCK THAT
[0:27:45] <%Zero_Jacks> How broken is ichigo now
[0:27:46] <BigYanno> Bleach is GREAT. The casual clothes Kubo draws and the music in the anime are BALLER
[0:27:46] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> it's the last chapter Miura worked on.
[0:27:48] <+megaman_sentinel> I have mixed feelings about that
[0:27:50] <+nial_evol> Berserk has proteges that already covered
[0:27:52] <+Shady_Zaku> WAIT WHAT?!??
[0:27:52] <Too_Much_Nukie> Aborr is for real.
[0:27:55] <fugly_nick> Berserk's new chapter is still Miura, I think
[0:27:57] <mr_saturday93> Bleach did end
[0:28:01] <%patriotrenegade> @PlaidisTheNewPlaid Bleach did end years ago
[0:28:02] <%whyskeywolfe> Pity the poor son of a bitch who has to put his name on Miura's work.
[0:28:04] <Wydamn> Sadge
[0:28:06] <DXLelouch24> WHAT?!
[0:28:07] <%baronblank> it sounded like berserk might just be continuing on, but we'll see
[0:28:09] <dekkitout> Wonder how long Berserk is gonna be on the Getter shelf
[0:28:10] <anAngryHamster> Bleach is like Naruto but worse
[0:28:13] <%Mr_Pylon> whatever it is I'll cry
[0:28:13] <Profmcstevie> Miura knew his health, I expect he may have laid out some groundwork to finish it....at least I hope
[0:28:14] <mr_saturday93> I hope Berserk still continues
[0:28:20] <%AFellowDegen> wild that after kentaros death beserk has a better chance of getting finished @PatStaresAt
[0:28:21] <BigYanno> Bleach ended about 2 years after it should have
[0:28:24] <Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah Berserk's new chapter is still Miura's work but he had only done the drafting work.
[0:28:27] <%KeiganOfAstora> They captured Muira's soul and forced him to keep going forever @PatStaresAt
[0:28:32] <%baronblank> I imagine miura left notes on what he planned
[0:28:34] <Too_Much_Nukie> @Profmcstevie He did lol. He had understudies.
[0:28:34] <DXLelouch24> @fugly_nick did that man plan for this?
[0:28:36] <majindusto> Last Miura Chapter BibleThump
[0:28:37] <%QueequegTheater> GYRM
[0:28:39] <+pupil31> Yeah that IP is way too valuable
[0:28:39] <%QueequegTheater> HOLY SHIT
[0:28:42] <+nial_evol> he already has people that helped him and emulated his style
[0:28:42] <%AncelDeLambert> Bleach should have ended after Ichigo beat Aizen
[0:28:44] <%Broand> ABORR
[0:28:47] <+the_drummaestro> That's a lot of damage tho
[0:28:48] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> I swear you all ask questions just to hear someone say they dont care about it
[0:28:48] <Too_Much_Nukie> This is the last Miura chapter yeah.
[0:28:51] <Wydamn> Thinking about it, somebody else probably should have stepped up to continue beserk, like, years ago.
[0:28:51] <%BoxNavy> AHH!
[0:28:52] <%Broand> ITS APYR
[0:28:53] <%baronblank> I left for a bit, random dwarf boss?
[0:28:53] <%AncelDeLambert> the fact that it continued with the mask bullshit was just sad
[0:28:55] <+the_drummaestro> ABORT
[0:28:56] <+pupil31> GALVAN DEAL
[0:28:57] <fugly_nick> There's so little room here too
[0:28:59] <Afterman_> @AncelDeLambert gin shouldve gotten the kill
[0:29:00] <BigFingerRo> NOW THAT'S A LOTTA DAMIDGE
[0:29:03] <BigYanno> when you kill the dog he goes into berserk mode btw
[0:29:04] <%patriotrenegade> doodYelp doodYelp
[0:29:05] <%whyskeywolfe> Pat watch out - it's that one guy
[0:29:07] <TYBGerritt> Yeah killing the dog definitely buffs him
[0:29:07] <Too_Much_Nukie> Aborr's pet dog is the biggest threat here Pat.
[0:29:09] <Zooperton> IT'S BIG PAT
[0:29:09] <Mattais88> @AncelDeLambert That's wher I stopped, so for me it did
[0:29:10] <Profmcstevie> Go home and be a family ash FamilyMan
[0:29:10] <Afterman_> @AncelDeLambert new arc is all about hell, we seeing all the dead character again
[0:29:13] <%patriotrenegade> GAVLAN KILL
[0:29:14] <%QueequegTheater> GALVAN NO DEAL, GALVAN PEEL YOUR SKIN
[0:29:15] <+TheBitingIrish> @KeiganOfAstora As long as it also gets to play IdolMaster, I would be fine with that
[0:29:20] <majindusto> ABORR
[0:29:22] <%CollinsOfBodom> don't bust the borks
[0:29:25] <fugly_nick> Spin 2 win
[0:29:27] <wibbwobbler> I think it was announced as a recolor of the last chapter with some extra I think
[0:29:28] <Too_Much_Nukie> He becomes much much stronger once you kill his dog.
[0:29:29] <+Grago231> @BigYanno I mean if someone killed my dog I'd go IRL berserk, makes sense
[0:29:30] <%HaroldDonchee> spin2win
[0:29:32] <%AncelDeLambert> What Kubo SHOULD have done was leave Ichigo powerless and have Ichigo's sister take over as a Shinigami
[0:29:33] <+Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> nice
[0:29:34] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Capra demon homage, with double ax and dogs

[0:36:32] <Mudstone12> hey pat should i download the models as well as the new version of cinders?
[0:36:35] <%cade_calrayn> I believe he said he stopped watching Paige & Pat specifically, not the Best Friends
[0:36:38] <+Birdigalore> It wasn't Ziegsy?  B ut I already got my pitchfork...
[0:36:46] <%cade_calrayn> And he posted it on a super sweet animation someone made for Paige
[0:36:48] <BigFingerRo> completely unprompted, though
[0:36:53] <+soycanadiense> OOF
[0:36:53] <thekingjanglesbible> keep it handy
[0:36:53] <penitentpendant> Patches, the ultimate human
[0:36:56] <%AncelDeLambert> LUL just eat it
[0:36:56] <$Jaxnos> burnt cheeks
[0:36:57] <BigFingerRo> it had nothing to do with the convo
[0:37:01] <+Grago231> What does he want you to wait for?
[0:37:04] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> lol pat has always been vaguely anti-shit and that usually manifests as anti-right, i dont think they watched much pat to begin with
[0:37:04] <+pupil31> LOL
[0:37:10] <$Ziegsy> @Birdigalore I mean, Id hate for you be disappointed
[0:37:12] <+pupil31> Siegward is way too late LUL
[0:37:13] <%cade_calrayn> speaking of which y'all should check it out on Paige's Twitter
[0:37:15] <%AncelDeLambert> RAAAAAAAAA!
[0:37:15] <dekkitout> Casual Balrog Slain

[0:37:18] <+soycanadiense> gg's
[0:37:19] <$Jaxnos> that took Sieg like an extra minute, like he contemplated if you were a dumbass this time
[0:37:19] <%cade_calrayn> the animation was super cool
[0:37:21] <Vyneci> I got a very strong "WHY WOULD TALK LIKE THIS TO YOUR VERY INTIMATE F R I E N D" vibe from what Paige quote tweeted
[0:37:25] <IminyourBase> didn't even let homie get last hit
[0:37:29] <homestylewaffles> he's still bugged I see
[0:37:29] <notsoy> sieg with the big assist

[0:37:38] <BliVru> r
[0:37:40] <+soycanadiense> whoops
[0:37:41] <Too_Much_Nukie> Siegeward bugged out for me last night and I had to put him down.
[0:37:41] <DracaenaLeaf> rip
[0:37:42] <dekkitout> Dang
[0:37:43] <fugly_nick> He's sleepy
[0:37:46] <AnacondaVirtue> No the quest is still working
[0:37:47] <fugly_nick> Try kicking him
[0:37:47] <IminyourBase> yeah because you didn't let him hit last. way to go and make him sad
[0:37:50] <%AncelDeLambert> it's okay, exiting out fixes it
[0:37:50] <+soycanadiense> t101Oof
[0:37:52] <+pupil31> :(
[0:37:54] <+Grago231> I love bugs!
[0:37:58] <%AzureGale> F
[0:37:59] <EM2_art> Sirris is bugged for me :(
[0:38:00] <+megaman_sentinel> kick
[0:38:01] <Too_Much_Nukie> Got this same bug yeah.
[0:38:01] <Dwaesq> But the siegbrau
[0:38:03] <+MisterAvry> how does he sit criss cross in that armor?
[0:38:05] <AnacondaVirtue> No you did it right, you just can't talk to him anymore for some reason. Same thing happened to me and it went just fine
[0:38:07] <+Grago231> How does this man SIT
[0:38:12] <$Jaxnos> sleepy boi
[0:38:13] <Dwaesq> Neat
[0:38:22] <%CollinsOfBodom> bug fixed
[0:38:26] <Too_Much_Nukie> This interaction is fine, Sirris is not.
[0:38:33] <thekingjanglesbible> @Grago231 lots of stretching
[0:38:34] <Too_Much_Nukie> Sirris never appears in firelink.
[0:38:40] <Profmcstevie> "long may the sun shine" sounds real dire considering what happens to the sun
[0:38:42] <+pupil31> It's relaxing
[0:38:46] <+Grago231> @PatStaresAt Sort of like driving?
[0:38:46] <%baka_sugoi> casual MURDER
[0:38:48] <%BoxNavy> :)
[0:38:51] <%Broand> I forget, what benefit is there to using pyromancy vs hexes and shit?
[0:38:56] <Ethel9727> There is something incredibly relaxing about Dark Souls once you're used to it @PatStaresAt
[0:39:03] <%BoxNavy> yeah
[0:39:12] <Profmcstevie> Rock their world
[0:39:15] <dekkitout> Hopefully it releases on as many platforms
[0:39:17] <+TheBitingIrish> I do not know. Please elaborate
[0:39:19] <%Dakuu75> I think most ppl have "that one game" that no matter how many times they beat... it's just good-feels @PatStaresAt
[0:39:19] <Mudstone12> i dont
[0:39:22] <BliVru> A shame you have us Chucklefucks ruining it tho
[0:39:27] <sirrice77> @Broand pyromancy requires minimal stat investment, i think
[0:39:32] <Too_Much_Nukie> @Broand Different spell effects, pryomancy spells don't have stat requirements, enemies that are weak to fire aren't necessarily weak to magic/dark.
[0:39:41] <Too_Much_Nukie> There's a lot of differences.
[0:39:43] <%Son_Bruce> How far along is pat in this run?
[0:39:43] <fugly_nick> Here's the Bloodborne merchant
[0:39:47] <%ZephynM> Oh this game! I like this game.
[0:39:47] <Profmcstevie> Being open world will give it so much room to fiddle
[0:39:48] <+Grago231> Gotta admit, I know nothing about Elden ring
[0:39:48] <%RealThiele> change horse to potart cat

[0:40:25] <Ethel9727> @PatStaresAt Some of the Bloodborne weapons also give you the Bloodborne dash dodge if you also have the quickstep ring on
[0:40:27] <%Broand> there's things you can give to him to get more gun later too

[0:41:20] <M0untain_wolf> YOOO
[0:41:22] <%AncelDeLambert> making it basically infinite

[0:41:25] <$Jaxnos> oh.
[0:41:25] <+TheBitingIrish> So it's basically infinite

[0:41:37] <+atin2000> Lucateil has GUN now, YEAH
[0:41:39] <+parazoa42> shooting it also drains durability really fast, at least in the version of the mod I plaed
[0:41:40] <thekingjanglesbible> ah the post, the gun's natural enemy
[0:41:41] <%AncelDeLambert> it shoots high
[0:41:42] <+TheBitingIrish> Gun not so good LUL
[0:41:44] <Too_Much_Nukie> Guns are very high-tier.
[0:41:45] <%CollinsOfBodom> pillar defeated

[0:41:49] <Too_Much_Nukie> And they scale with DEX.
[0:41:49] <DXLelouch24> Glock Saint Build
[0:41:50] <$Jaxnos> oh, so it is accurate. pat misses with it like he does in the shootybangs.
[0:41:52] <M0untain_wolf> kinda hard to target low
[0:41:52] <+coffeebearCafe> no aim
[0:41:52] <nekrabeats> Where is ak47?
[0:41:54] <fugly_nick> It used to degrade the gun's durability with each shot, but I guess they changed that
[0:41:55] <%Broand> Infuse gun with lightning
[0:42:01] <zegram250> shoot that fucker
[0:42:04] <Too_Much_Nukie> The dogs are too fast.

[0:42:20] <fugly_nick> That's insanely broken
[0:42:20] <DrkJP520> I don't suppose you can parry with the gun.
[0:42:21] <Profmcstevie> Mimic this you fucking casual

[0:42:50] <%AncelDeLambert> you can only have a gun in your left hand
[0:42:58] <Too_Much_Nukie> @Jaxnos It is sadly not but you get a lot of counter damage for it.
[0:42:58] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> The build you were born to run
[0:43:01] <fugly_nick> You can't dual wield, guns are locked to your left hand
[0:43:01] <+TheBitingIrish> omg, CAN YOU gunsling it?
[0:43:03] <%YakumoYomi> I know it's minor, but the way you two-hand katanas in Dark Souls bothers me
[0:43:06] <+TheBitingIrish> Aw
[0:43:06] <DXLelouch24> @anceldelambert for now

[0:44:13] <Too_Much_Nukie> Evenin' gents.
[0:44:13] <%AncelDeLambert> you can also infuse the guns
[0:44:13] <thekingjanglesbible> @DapperCadavr the elder gun orb
[0:44:16] <BackflipCharm> Does the gun scale?

[0:44:17] <+MisterAvry> problem is now you're playing DMC2
[0:44:18] <M0untain_wolf> BlamBlam Shall be its name
[0:44:19] <%AncelDeLambert> so you can put sharp or lethal on the gun
[0:44:20] <AstrodropGaming> GUN
[0:44:26] <Too_Much_Nukie> @WhereIsWill Blunderbuss shoots in a cone
[0:44:26] <Ethel9727> You can send him to firelink
[0:44:27] <fugly_nick> @Laecerelius Woolie...it's a gun!
[0:44:29] <%AncelDeLambert> yes. You ask him to
[0:44:30] <Ethel9727> There's a dialogue option @PatStaresAt
[0:44:32] <homestylewaffles> you can tell him to go back to firelink
[0:44:35] <homestylewaffles> talk to him
[0:44:35] <Too_Much_Nukie> @WhereIsWill Repeater fires faster.
[0:44:35] <%AncelDeLambert> talk to him
[0:44:36] <thekingjanglesbible> why move with a view like that
[0:44:36] <+Grago231> I'm fairly sure he does go to firelink if you talk
[0:44:37] <AstrodropGaming> The GUN is good
[0:44:38] <Mudstone12> rak.oo.yo
[0:44:41] <%CollinsOfBodom> rollin down undead settlement with a shotgun

[0:45:10] <Too_Much_Nukie> The Church Cannon in this is FUCKING hilarious.
[0:45:10] <Laecerelius> Yeah

[0:45:20] <%WhereIsWill> yeyeye
[0:45:20] <+AnActualHermitCrab> Rock-e-oh
[0:45:23] <Ethel9727> Rakuyo doesn't have a unique moveset sadly
[0:45:24] <BliVru> Infuse the CHURCH CANNON with sharp too! LUL
[0:45:25] <Wydamn> Rockio
[0:45:27] <%AncelDeLambert> which one?
[0:45:31] <KaiserMario> Rakuyo?
[0:45:33] <%patriotrenegade> Rockio
[0:45:35] <%AncelDeLambert> oh, the katana
[0:45:36] <Too_Much_Nukie> If you get the flamethrower, which is called the rosemarius here, it gets different attack types and names based on its infusion type.
[0:45:37] <thekingjanglesbible> I hate the horrible shark bastards
[0:45:41] <fugly_nick> Cainhurst has my favorite weapons, but they take so long to get
[0:45:42] <+AnActualHermitCrab> the rockio is my favorite too!
[0:45:45] <+twohitgood> rakuyo
[0:45:49] <GuyverTypeL> yeah!
[0:45:50] <dekkitout> Couldn't chalice dungeons let you get it early
[0:45:54] <+twohitgood> ra ku yo
[0:45:55] <KaiserMario> Lady Maria's
[0:45:56] <%YakumoYomi> Ra-kyo
[0:45:56] <ZooRaggy> nah just kill Eileen and get the Blade of Mercy off the rip
[0:45:57] <+SoySocks> rah-koo-yo
[0:45:58] <Ethel9727> It's just basic DS3 Katana moveset still sadly
[0:45:59] <+RowenCleric> its Lady Marias weapon
[0:45:59] <%patriotrenegade> ra-ku-yo
[0:46:00] <+parazoa42> rah koo yo
[0:46:04] <%Son_Bruce> RA KU YO
[0:46:04] <%BoxNavy> ☝️ 🤓 you said it wrong
[0:46:04] <GuyverTypeL> show rakyo
[0:46:05] <%Dakuu75> Ra-ku-yo
[0:46:08] <thekingjanglesbible> *its like a saber/katana* and its RAD
[0:46:10] <M0untain_wolf> RA-KU-O?
[0:46:11] <+TheBitingIrish> Ra like in Rat
[0:46:11] <Ciglossonjr> rah koo yo
[0:46:15] <%CollinsOfBodom> japanese sword
[0:46:19] <%AncelDeLambert> enough temp intelligence to send the mage merchant to Firelink
[0:46:24] <Profmcstevie> All my intelligence is temporary, foolish game
[0:46:24] <Too_Much_Nukie> There's a mod that gives Rakuyo a much cooler move set but it requires Cinders 1.82 ONLY.
[0:46:25] <%LeiaSkynoober> haha nerds knowing how to say japanese words
[0:46:26] <%RealThiele> Rock-ee-oh
[0:46:26] <%BoxNavy> kaytanner
[0:46:27] <$Ziegsy> BY-AH-KYOO-GAN
[0:46:27] <+AnActualHermitCrab> You're saying it like "rocky-oh" lol.
[0:46:29] <%baronblank> the rakuyo is cool but yea it comes too late and is a pain in the ass to get
[0:46:30] <KaiserMario> Say Mario, Pat
[0:46:38] <borkmire> has pat looked at the black katanas move set he got at the start of the run?
[0:46:42] <Shirousuke1989> Bloodborne would be a lot better IMO if you unlocked all the weapons halfway into the game and that's not me exaggerating.
[0:46:43] <+qanonisadeathcult> sounds funny bc of your accent i guess
[0:46:46] <M0untain_wolf> MO-RI-O
[0:46:51] <M0untain_wolf> yppp
[0:46:53] <+pupil31> Bang bang
[0:46:55] <+TheBitingIrish> ooooo
[0:46:57] <%AncelDeLambert> @Shirousuke1989 100% agree
[0:46:58] <%whyskeywolfe> For anyone following it, Kill 6 Billion Demons just updated, and it's a doozy.
[0:46:58] <BigFingerRo> Wait , so this gun has endless ammo?
[0:46:59] <%CollinsOfBodom> blap blap
[0:47:03] <%RealThiele> blackface katana LUL
[0:47:05] <fugly_nick> @baronblank It might as well just be a NG+ weapon like the Scythe
[0:47:05] <M0untain_wolf> The BlamBlam
[0:47:05] <%Issun135> the pole has a whack move set
[0:47:13] <+pupil31> BUH BUH
[0:47:14] <Too_Much_Nukie> @BigFingerRo Takes FP and stamina instead of bullets.
[0:47:16] <%AncelDeLambert> the two best ARcane weapons are locked behind endgame bosses in Bloodborne, it's trash
[0:47:20] <luckyifpurple> Ran up on a mimic and caught him lacking
[0:47:23] <+AnActualHermitCrab> My favorite part is pat pronouncing Naruto like "Nair-it-oh". I think that's really cute... u////u
[0:47:24] <%CollinsOfBodom> 360 no scope
[0:47:25] <Too_Much_Nukie> So with some builds you can fire forever.
[0:47:35] <%BoxNavy> bandanas
[0:47:35] <BigFingerRo> @Too_Much_Nukie THAT IS SO BUSTED
[0:47:40] <M0untain_wolf> jesus
[0:47:42] <%RealThiele> BURY ME BURY ME
[0:47:42] <thekingjanglesbible> BLAP
[0:47:43] <%ZephynM> So has the gun always been there or is it a new update?
[0:47:46] <%WhereIsWill> thats busted af
[0:47:50] <M0untain_wolf> LUL
[0:47:51] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> I love that gun
[0:47:51] <%baka_sugoi> GUN POG
[0:47:55] <%baronblank> hey Pat, have you checked out any of the FF pixel remasters? I was disappointed initially but trying them out now and the music and looks are pretty great not gonna lie
[0:47:55] <mr_saturday93> SO BUSTED
[0:47:59] <+vaderxyz1970> @bigfingerro ITS A GUN
[0:48:03] <%Taisuru> Taisuru subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 29 months! Look at me, I'm Pat, fart fart fart
[0:48:04] <BigFingerRo> @AnActualHermitCrab Cmon, no uwu? can't even throw an uwu out?
[0:48:05] <%CollinsOfBodom> never stop firing
[0:48:15] <Too_Much_Nukie> @BigFingerRo It is busted yes. But it's not as strong as crossbows and bows are.
[0:48:16] <fugly_nick> Last time I played the mod, the guns degraded with each shot so you wouldn't have infinite ammo, that seemed way more balanced than this
[0:48:17] <%MechArch> can you dual wield guns?
[0:48:17] <%ZephynM> I heard mod so now I know.
[0:48:18] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> they are perfect right now
[0:48:21] <Too_Much_Nukie> LUL
[0:48:23] <+TurnipKupo> :0 must be OP as heck in pvp?
[0:48:28] <$KaosMachina> but do they import bloodborne ENEMIES
[0:48:34] <%Deft_Thought> So anyway, I started blastin
[0:48:36] <kndle56> You're bringing a gun into fantasy medieval world of course you're going to be the best
[0:48:37] <insomniac_doze_> the problem with this is the fp recharge
[0:48:37] <+pupil31> I remember there's like a modern rifle mod for dark souls LUL
[0:48:37] <honzoh> this is even cheesier than magic
[0:48:38] <LtBoiii> its like adding shields to bloodborne
[0:48:46] <M0untain_wolf> I dont know why this GUN went through so many rebalanced
[0:48:47] <Too_Much_Nukie> @TurnipKupo Cinders PvP is fucking stupid lol. Everyone is OP in different ways.
[0:48:53] <$KaosMachina> did you just store your bare hands
[0:48:59] <thekingjanglesbible> is there a ring that restores fp on hit? would that actually matter with the passive regen or is stamina the rate limiting factor here?
[0:49:01] <+TurnipKupo> @Too_Much_Nukie ahhh i see :3
[0:49:03] <GuyverTypeL> who needs magic when you have GUN
[0:49:08] <M0untain_wolf> Sharp bullets
[0:49:08] <%WhereIsWill> that S tho
[0:49:09] <%AncelDeLambert> stats don't have caps anymore on damage
[0:49:11] <Too_Much_Nukie> @KaosMachina No those are the fists of god.
[0:49:15] <+pupil31> The Equalizer Pog
[0:49:16] <M0untain_wolf> they gun even deeper
[0:49:20] <%AncelDeLambert> there is no longer a soft cap on DEX, fyi
[0:49:28] <%RealThiele> dapper bullets
[0:49:40] <Too_Much_Nukie> Lightning guns is the meta because you can stunlock everyone.
[0:49:42] <%TheWinged7> time to show peach how to realy beat that tree, with poopy pants Kappa
[0:49:43] <%Taisuru> can pistol parry in this game?
[0:49:45] <Ris_Eltrut> @PatStaresAt are in a covenant
[0:49:47] <M0untain_wolf> unlimited DEX works
[0:49:52] <+Grago231> with the power of GUN
[0:49:53] <The_UnfathoMarble> can you hold the gun in your main hand?
[0:49:55] <LtBoiii> time to shoot a damn tree
[0:49:59] <Too_Much_Nukie> @Taisuru No, but it has higher counter damage like knives do.
[0:50:04] <%RealThiele> shoot his balls!
[0:50:06] <Too_Much_Nukie> @The_UnfathoMarble Nope.
[0:50:07] <fugly_nick> You can't
[0:50:10] <%That1blindkid> wasnt that bonfire closer?
[0:50:13] <%baka_sugoi> really?
[0:50:14] <%YakumoYomi> You can't. Guns a left hand only
[0:50:14] <%Dakuu75> can you 2-hand the gun?
[0:50:19] <Profmcstevie> Two hand a gun, what could go wrong
[0:50:20] <AnacondaVirtue> The gun is left-hand only, actually. In the tradition of BB
[0:50:21] <thekingjanglesbible> akimbo-build wen?
[0:50:21] <DracaenaLeaf> that back fence doesn't do jack for bullets
[0:50:24] <Too_Much_Nukie> Guns are a category called sidearms that can only be used in the left hand.
[0:50:29] <M0untain_wolf> JESUS
[0:50:30] <%BoxNavy> he help any time
[0:50:31] <thekingjanglesbible> aw
[0:50:31] <fugly_nick> Guns are a new weapon type called a Sidearm, which are locked to your left hand
[0:50:42] <%CollinsOfBodom> artillery strike
[0:50:47] <thekingjanglesbible> this is now house of the dead
[0:50:47] <Ner234> I cast GUN
[0:50:48] <+the_drummaestro> infinite ammo?
[0:51:01] <M0untain_wolf> Thanks Giant bowmen
[0:51:02] <Too_Much_Nukie> Costs FP.
[0:51:05] <Ris_Eltrut> Good thing the guns using durability was reverted
[0:51:06] <Too_Much_Nukie> And stamina
[0:51:18] <+atin2000> "I'm going to save the world with skill, perseverance and this gun I found"
[0:51:21] <M0untain_wolf> Maybe need more FP drain of use
[0:51:21] <dekkitout> So the answer at the moment is Gun Wizard
[0:51:22] <thekingjanglesbible> souls needed some good grindhouse mods
[0:51:22] <%patriotrenegade> @PatStaresAt If you run to that platform when fighting Hodrick he just falls off the cliff and dies
[0:51:24] <The_UnfathoMarble> is there an L2 and L1?
[0:51:27] <Thyzoon> consumables like bolts and arrows maybe
[0:51:30] <KnightOfTrousers> There's already arrows in the game, so what's the difference there?
[0:51:30] <%AncelDeLambert> no more ashes
[0:51:32] <Profmcstevie> It might need to chew a lot more FP
[0:51:38] <%RealThiele> have holding a gun reduce FP regen
[0:51:39] <%AncelDeLambert> items go to the shop upon boss death
[0:51:40] <dekkitout> A ballistimancer if you would
[0:51:44] <Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah you can't easily add a brand new ammunition type.
[0:51:50] <+vaderxyz1970> At what point does Cinders become its own spiritual successor
[0:51:52] <+tempestzephyr> would it, it'd just be like arrows?
[0:52:02] <Too_Much_Nukie> It's better to have it be OP and fun than over balance it and make it not fun.
[0:52:07] <BliVru> No more ashes all unlocks with zones
[0:52:08] <%doomunderthestairs> doomunderthestairs subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months! Thanks for all the laughs!  Any chance of going through Shining Force in the future?
[0:52:13] <Too_Much_Nukie> @tempestzephyr You'd have to create an entire new class of variable.
[0:52:17] <$KaosMachina> couldn't you just make them use some custom type of bolt and treat them as crossbows
[0:52:26] <Too_Much_Nukie> No.
[0:52:35] <Too_Much_Nukie> Because then crossbows would use them.
[0:52:39] <ApexJaggi> Gun Souls.
[0:52:40] <dekkitout> Wha- noooo
[0:52:40] <%captain_kirkhammer> I just got here, is that a fucking gun
[0:52:40] <thekingjanglesbible> so was the magic
[0:52:41] <fugly_nick> Just a bit
[0:52:42] <+vaderxyz1970> Nah
[0:52:45] <Thyzoon> needs an ammo type like arrows or bolts perhaps
[0:52:56] <%patriotrenegade> maybe just use it to finish off enemies?
[0:52:58] <Too_Much_Nukie> You can't just make a new type of arrow that only this one type of weapon can use but other weapons can't.
[0:53:00] <segychan> GUN
[0:53:02] <BackflipCharm> And decent source of ranged damage is busted in these games
[0:53:03] <Ethel9727> @KaosMachina Then you'd just buy 999 of the bolts and they would be even stronger
[0:53:03] <AstrodropGaming> A gun with infinite bullts is broken? Im shocked
[0:53:04] <BliVru> Well Pat remember you have Curses to fix that
[0:53:05] <%CollinsOfBodom> @captain_kirkhammer That is a fucking gun
[0:53:06] <fugly_nick> Magic at least has a casting time
[0:53:09] <DracaenaLeaf> ew
[0:53:09] <%YakumoYomi> Not the framerate door!
[0:53:10] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Just think of it as casting GUN
[0:53:13] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Lumber-Pat ready to chop down the evil tree
[0:53:22] <+Fooguwu> shoot them balls
[0:53:24] <ApexJaggi> Does gun scale with stats?
[0:53:29] <The_UnfathoMarble> do you shoot with the L2 or the L1? or both?
[0:53:34] <Ethel9727> It is basically the same as having an off-hand staff or something
[0:53:34] <Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah they do.
[0:53:36] <%baka_sugoi> LUL LUL sbfpSetIn LUL
[0:53:38] <+Grago231> it's dark souls, do what's fun
[0:53:42] <Too_Much_Nukie> Pat is doing a dex run which makes the guns even stronger.
[0:53:42] <thekingjanglesbible> i feel like nobody goes into cinders and says "well how can i make this a balanced experience"
[0:53:43] <EM2_art> Guns? KKona
[0:53:46] <segychan> wow thats good
[0:53:48] <fugly_nick> Lets see how quick Greatwood goes down
[0:53:52] <%muetank> I will kill this tree with the power of friendship! and this gun I found!
[0:54:02] <%TheDullaMAN> Shoot its balls!
[0:54:04] <thekingjanglesbible> SHOOT HIS BALLS
[0:54:07] <%YakumoYomi> Shoot his tree balls!
[0:54:07] <%captain_kirkhammer> Yeah but is it a good poorly or a bad poorly
[0:54:08] <Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah gun will get weaker as you go through the game.
[0:54:11] <+RootVeggie> man I love that FP is more generous
[0:54:12] <thekingjanglesbible> @TheDullaMAN eyyy
[0:54:16] <%RealThiele> the ol' dick shoot
[0:54:16] <%AncelDeLambert> yeah, Greatwood is trivial these days
[0:54:17] <%MechArch> shoot tree nut
[0:54:18] <dan_g_v> oh no, his balls
[0:54:18] <notsoy> that is some epic manspreading
[0:54:18] <%WhereIsWill> gross
[0:54:18] <%CollinsOfBodom> shoot the devil out of that ficus
[0:54:18] <Too_Much_Nukie> Bad poorly.
[0:54:19] <+pupil31> Give them freedom brother KKona
[0:54:23] <Wydamn> That's some good CBT
[0:54:24] <$KaosMachina> you would think a gun would have even less stat scaling than a crossbow
[0:54:25] <Too_Much_Nukie> The scaling is like D or C I think.
[0:54:27] <%baka_sugoi> remember when paige fought this long ago LUL
[0:54:28] <ApexJaggi> Slaying ancient creatures with the power of musket.
[0:54:32] <DXLelouch24> Shoot it
[0:54:33] <segychan> IF U GOT SHOT, I WOULDN"T GO TO YOUR FUNERAL.... CAUZE I"D BE IN JAIL FOR KILLIN THA MOTHAFUCKA THAT SHOT YOUUUUUU :GUN:
[0:54:35] <Too_Much_Nukie> @KaosMachina It does.
[0:54:39] <%AncelDeLambert> right hip

[0:55:26] <%Broand> Oh I was gonna ask what aborr transposes into
[0:55:35] <%AncelDeLambert> okay, fuck the poison ring, I guess
[0:55:35] <LtBoiii> no new boss items?
[0:55:36] <BliVru> Use Sacrife in the Bonfire
[0:55:39] <Ethel9727> Aborr gives a really good ring
[0:55:46] <%AncelDeLambert> LOTS new boss items
[0:55:52] <Ethel9727> Also, best use of GUN in dark souls is handling dogs
[0:55:55] <Thyzoon> isn't there a chest in there?
[0:55:58] <%AncelDeLambert> bye bye Grandpa
[0:56:09] <thekingjanglesbible> 5 minutes later and I'd forgotten our goal

[0:57:31] <gustavozxd> Pat having a good time with the mod?
[0:57:39] <%AncelDeLambert> the box gives you the sniper rifle, the soul gives you the endgame boss scythe
[0:57:45] <Ris_Eltrut> Did Pat get Mound Makers covenant?
[0:57:49] <%RealThiele> Blussy
[0:57:58] <Too_Much_Nukie> Rakuyo isn't even that good without the moveset mod.
[0:58:10] <ohkayNiko> lol
[0:58:10] <GuyverTypeL> @realthiele Tomorrow
[0:58:21] <ohkayNiko> not even the real rakuyo
[0:58:24] <ohkayNiko> feels bad man
[0:58:25] <%AncelDeLambert> yeah, sorry, Pat, it's just a katana now
[0:58:28] <%RealThiele> Blunder blussy could be now tho
[0:58:30] <%42nfl19> @PatStaresAt Do Trick weapons actually transform or are they still static?
[0:58:31] <gustavozxd> just noticed the weapon, weird but cool
[0:58:37] <KaiserMario> boo
[0:58:45] <BliVru> Just wait one more patch
[0:58:47] <dekkitout> Quite deflating
[0:58:47] <ApexJaggi> Dark Souls characters can't figure out how to separate Rakuyo, brain too small.
[0:58:49] <%AncelDeLambert> there's still the Moundmaker covenant katana
[0:58:52] <grimsmo1> Sorry to ask, but I can't even get past the first boss, any tips?
[0:58:52] <$KaosMachina> they just said 'moveset mod' which implies to me that no, they're not
[0:58:52] <%WhereIsWill> looks cool at least
[0:58:53] <Profmcstevie> All in due time hopefully
[0:58:53] <homestylewaffles> @42nfl19 some do, or get close enough
[0:59:02] <Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah you need a second mod to give it the cool moveset.
[0:59:07] <+tempestzephyr> wait it doesn't separate?

[1:15:23] <%Broand> It's a overhaul mod it looks like
[1:15:28] <Wydamn> Pat Stares at Big Chair mod
[1:15:33] <%TheDullaMAN> Gears are turning...
[1:15:33] <%General_Terro> react andy
[1:15:41] <BliVru> IS A FIGHTING GAME?
[1:15:46] <%TheDullaMAN> A mod.
[1:15:48] <%Broand> New main story?
[1:16:03] <Wydamn> The real arch thrones were the friends we made along the way
[1:16:11] <Thyzoon> I think an overhaul akin to Demons' Souls, redoing the layout of levels with each throne in Firelink.
[1:16:19] <Thyzoon> At least that's what I gathered.
[1:16:30] <%Order_of_Mystery> @PatStaresAt looks like an overhaul mod, and the first result I got on youtube was a dual fight with Ornstein and Nameless King. That's pretty hype!
[1:16:32] <+kuroyami15> Looks like it restructures DS3 to be like DES
[1:16:34] <BliVru> ***

[1:17:05] <Profmcstevie> first time streamer
[1:17:11] <%BoxNavy> <<<<
[1:17:11] <BliVru> Found this: Archthrones is a DS3 mod that aims to bring some mechanics from Demon's Souls, such as world layout, soul form, world tendency, etc. while still keeping it within the Dark Souls universe. The world of Dark Souls 3 has been rearranged into 5 separate realms, each with their own story.  Archthrones will provide players with a completely new way to experience Dark Souls 3. Every map will be redesigned in some way to fit the new narrative. Every boss fight is completely new with incredib
[1:17:11] <%thedankestmeeme> you dioont want everyone to see your lewds?
[1:17:35] <%LaughingCatt> i want a mod to replace those thrones with plastic lawn chairs

[1:20:05] <Thyzoon> I found out about it today so even I'm super fuzzy on the details but it looks fucking dope

[1:22:21] <+ScrapKingKeita> Boogie Woogie is from Jujutsu Kaisen where the person can swap places with something by clapping his hand @PatStaresAt
[1:22:23] <%whyskeywolfe> with that personally
[1:22:25] <%weissguard> That was a spoiler for Jujutsu Kaisen
[1:22:26] <%Agami23> its from the anime jujitsu kaisen
[1:22:35] <Zooperton> personality I assume instead of personally?
[1:22:37] <%Order_of_Mystery> brap
[1:22:39] <Profmcstevie> Weeb shit? WEEB SHIT
[1:22:46] <%doomunderthestairs> yasssss

[1:22:49] <%doomunderthestairs> because I love it
[1:22:54] <Profmcstevie> Shining Legacy
[1:22:54] <DianaTheAscian> to make you sad
[1:23:04] <BliVru> @Ris_Eltrut Oh right that makes sence
[1:23:11] <%doomunderthestairs> I only played through 1 on an old sega jam cd on the pc
[1:23:14] <moogleboy1984> There's a decent complete story rewrite mod
[1:23:16] <%Dementedpenguin> Shining Force 1 and its damn mountain robot.
[1:23:27] <Profmcstevie> But have you ever streamed them barbCheers
[1:23:33] <%doomunderthestairs> its so fucking cooo
[1:23:35] <%doomunderthestairs> cool
[1:23:42] <%Taisuru> when stream them
[1:23:42] <Mattais88> So Three houses?
[1:23:45] <%Broand> oh it's on steam
[1:23:54] <+ScrapKingKeita> Rhapsody: A Musical Adventure @PatStaresAt
[1:23:58] <+coffeebearCafe> cuz it sucks?
[1:24:05] <%Order_of_Mystery> ...it sounds like you should stream Shining Force 1 and 2, Biggest Pat
[1:24:18] <+Dorf1> fire emblem gaiden was like that and it sucked because the fights werent rare
[1:24:19] <Profmcstevie> Battles are strategy, rest is traditional? Sounds rad
[1:24:35] <+coffeebearCafe> yeah thats fair
[1:24:45] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt how common are fights? cause thats sounds exhausting
[1:24:49] <%KeiganOfAstora> Ragnarok was like that
[1:25:26] <%Taisuru> you get in like one fight between towns iirc
[1:25:28] <GuyverTypeL> Great game
[1:25:38] <Profmcstevie> I refuse to believe you till you stream it extensively barbChad
[1:25:41] <+Undenizen> Hey Pat, I got to meet the lead dev for Disco Elysium yesterday
[1:25:41] <moogleboy1984> Egress exploiting for levels
[1:25:47] <+ScrapKingKeita> That honestly sounds like Rhapsody, though Rhapsody has very short fights that are semi-frequent
[1:25:54] <%baronblank> I loved shining force 1 but didn’t get far in 2, I wasn’t a fan of 2 tbh
[1:25:55] <%RealThiele> oh no barb emote
