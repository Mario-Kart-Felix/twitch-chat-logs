[0:41:42] <tanarath> @cartakus in leveling dungeons, which pat is doing, the game checks if you have gear. Pats saving everything that's dropped so the game will drop what he doesn't have, for glamour/visual gear.

[0:43:35] <%Guardiansaiyan> yum
[0:43:38] <%Alazull> Wall. To. Wall.
[0:43:40] <DistantPower> so you can take it to the bathroom with you and know when you're gonna miss your qeueu
[0:43:41] <%crimsonharvest> you too can be strong like an orphan
[0:43:41] <Zukozai> Eggs are the true xp food
[0:43:43] <%NopeBadguy> what you don't use MINERAL WATER
[0:43:43] <%dankjerri> no, eat your raisins
[0:43:43] <%JoshManVGH> TRAIN CRIMES
[0:43:45] <%NopeBadguy> stay hydrated
[0:43:50] <Blank9> I eat a boiled egg

[0:44:03] <%JoshManVGH> @dankjerri This guy gets it
[0:44:04] <@QueequegTheater> RPR AoE is so busted
[0:44:05] <+Masked_Hero_Lucky> It sure is
[0:44:09] <%abrupt_abe> A bit overtuned
[0:44:10] <%NopeBadguy> wait
[0:44:14] <%NopeBadguy> why soulsow during uptime?
[0:44:18] <Falcis_Ultima> dont soulsow mid fight pat come on
[0:44:20] <Raz_Pataz> big numbers
[0:44:20] <+fugatlas> people who somehow made it to endwalker without turning off the repeat cutscenes option are either skip-buyers or masochists, tthats the only answer
[0:44:23] <bullprophet> yeah RPR aoe is fucking absurd, the entire job feels strong
[0:44:24] <%Puhff> I wish I could feel well fed from one glass of OJ like like WoL
[0:44:26] <tanarath> Yeah, people be saying that, expect potency nerfs in 6.1
[0:44:27] <%tetraes> is SAM no longer big number class lol?
[0:44:28] <cartakus> I wonder if he will be nerfed
[0:44:29] <%Dakuu75> @PatStaresAt do you have a favorite DPS food? (I think mine is Sausage and Saurkraut IL. 480)
[0:44:30] <Raz_Pataz> spoken like a true dps
[0:44:39] <%NopeBadguy> soulsow during uptime seems like a loss but i mean it's 83 who cares
[0:44:43] <%dankjerri> pat has not figured the rotation just yet, he will however press a button and do a damage
[0:44:45] <+Sogeki_Dan> Why eat? You don't get EXP for monster kills anymore in dungeons. You get bulk exp at the end of the event
[0:44:46] <%Vyskus> Just hit button
[0:44:55] <%Verboseobserver> Did Pat have to jump through any hoops to get the ps5 controller features working on pc?
[0:45:04] <%GarbageNirvana> Are you doing combo?
[0:45:04] <HibikiYamada> @Sogeki_Dan bosses give exp
[0:45:09] <%baka_sugoi> press button win
[0:45:09] <ToneBacas> Pat talks in the third person now?
[0:45:14] <%dankjerri> EXP GOOD
[0:45:15] <Tomschiii> so how exactly can you turn your things into seals?
[0:45:16] <LittleBigQuebec> right now ranking says reaper is the best dps but i'm expecting a nerf because it also grannts party buffs
[0:45:20] <+Fetrigon> jiyuSpin jiyuSpin jiyuSpin unga
[0:45:30] <Raz_Pataz> honestly unlocking gluttony made me start properly enjoying reaper
[0:45:30] <cartakus> What is the next level of edge for a job after reaper-chan?
[0:45:31] <%templar010> templar010 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 37 months, currently on a 27 month streak! Hey Pat. Hit EW credits last night and I have to say it may be one of the best RPG stories I'
[0:45:34] <%Dakuu75> Oh, I eat food for the stats because I wanna hit harder...
[0:45:35] <%Saunt> Get high ranked in GC to trade them in
[0:45:45] <%dankjerri> i need to level Bard.
[0:45:50] <+Masked_Hero_Lucky> Do combo, get red, do gibbet, gallows, or guillotine, go sicko mode
[0:45:52] <SaltyAzteca> Im about to start Disco Elysium. Any pointers before I delve into this?
[0:45:52] <%Alazull> @Dakuu75 Same
[0:45:58] <%Ynkubus_> @cartakus necromancer if it gets added
[0:46:00] <%NopeBadguy> i imagine it's probably gonna get a potency hit when savage drops
[0:46:01] <%EmanXLR> ps5 controller features like the trigger stuff got added with EW
[0:46:10] <goroke> RPR isn't too busted, it just feels really nice and fun
[0:46:17] <%dankjerri> at least pat can still be dark, edgy, AND contribute to the party
[0:46:17] <%JoshManVGH> @tomschiii If you go to your grand company there's a guy who let's you "Undertake Supply Missions" Third tab is for handing over dungeon and raid gear for seals.
[0:46:20] <cartakus> Oh that would be nice
[0:46:26] <%Verboseobserver> SeemsGood
[0:46:31] <%Dakuu75> Is there a slider to controll rumble strength?
[0:46:38] <Zeif00> is RPR strongest melee deeps right now?
[0:46:52] <%Shikari21> ITS THE STRONGEST OF ALL DPS
[0:46:53] <LittleBigQuebec> yes
[0:46:54] <LittleBigQuebec> it is
[0:46:56] <%Shikari21> oops caps
[0:46:59] <%Visorak6> yeah its reaper, monk, sam
[0:47:06] <%JoshManVGH> It's outpacing SAM?
[0:47:08] <LittleBigQuebec> it's somehow better than black mage too
[0:47:10] <@QueequegTheater> DRG is still cooler
[0:47:12] <HibikiYamada> wait really? holy shit
[0:47:17] <Falcis_Ultima> mnk still outdps rpr
[0:47:17] <%dankjerri> guys, tell me if i imagined this: didnt they say you could seperste your procs and buffs this expansion on your hud? i still havent found the button
[0:47:17] <%Divryne> Job DPS is changing in less than a week so all the numbers don't matter until Savage is released.
[0:47:23] <%JoshManVGH> MNK does damage now!?
[0:47:24] <OpenYourEels4TheNextFeels> Why does this BGM sound like Persona battle music?
[0:47:25] <%Dakuu75> reaper gear is in teh sam category as sam and mnk, fucking really? lol
[0:47:27] <%GarbageNirvana> Enjoy it before the 6.1 nerf which is undoubtedly gonna happen
[0:47:28] <+Fetrigon> @queequegtheater Copium
[0:47:34] <%NopeBadguy> last i checked fflogs it's like mostly reapers and monks
[0:47:36] <%DeadStage> SAM still does the most DPS it's just there's a lot of bad SAMs right now
[0:47:36] <%LaughingCatt> zapped
[0:47:37] <+Fetrigon> LUL
[0:47:38] <%NopeBadguy> and a singular drg holding it down
[0:47:39] <%UvBenServed> LUL
[0:47:42] <DistantPower> reaper will probably get tuned down in the raid patches tho
[0:47:46] <%Zundelle> I don't even care if it gets nerfed I just really like how it feels so far and satisfies my desire to sicko mode
[0:47:46] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Optimal dungeon makeup is currently 1 WAR 3 RPR
[0:47:46] <%Alazull> Likes REPEL, opposites ATTRACT
[0:47:47] <%Akizea> oh hey hes leveling raper
[0:47:50] <%Shikari21> rpr mnk sam and blm are the top 4
[0:47:52] <%NopeBadguy> i see pat, too, does not know how magnets work
[0:47:52] <+xysizzle> statistically it’s the #1 dps in the game
[0:47:53] <xDartuzax> Magnets, how do they work?
[0:47:54] <%dankjerri> queequeg is correct, big lance and pointy armor cool
[0:47:57] <GilliamYaeger> @SaltyAzteca Shivers, Espirit de Corps, Inland Empire and Volition are the Important Skills, everything else you can level at your interest, they're all pretty great. Visual Calculus results in some super fun scenes every so often.
[0:48:06] <+Fetrigon> @queequegtheater LUL LUL LUL
[0:48:07] <%DianaTheAscian> @patstaresat was it DRG or SAM that you said you didn't like the changes on Twitter?
[0:48:16] <%RocketBarrel> SAM is definitely getting buffed before Savage hits
[0:48:24] <%Alazull> Yeah
[0:48:29] <%RocketBarrel> @dianatheascian DRK
[0:48:30] <%VioletHeart> Seeing a chunk vanish is great.
[0:48:37] <%NopeBadguy> have you tried new monk at all @PatStaresAt
[0:48:43] <%Baljhet> wait, what's wrong with the sam changes?
[0:48:43] <%dankjerri> did RPR just do the Disembowel animation
[0:48:43] <%Alazull> It's like dropping an Akh Morn with the +damage buff up on SMN
[0:48:48] <%RealThiele> ye its like bahamut phase for SMN
[0:48:52] <%Dakuu75> the only samurai change I remember is Merciful Eyes getting deleted
[0:48:53] <DistantPower> DRG changes are very nice just QoL wise
[0:48:56] <@QueequegTheater> There were basically no DRG changes
[0:49:07] <SaltyAzteca> @gilliamyaeger is there a timer or can I take my time with it?
[0:49:15] <%NopeBadguy> drg got basically a new move at 90 and qol
[0:49:21] <%NopeBadguy> there isn't much to change how you actually play the job
[0:49:26] <%RocketBarrel> I'm personally fine with SAM changes. Love charges on Meikyo
[0:49:27] <%dankjerri> they made everything less clunky this expansion, i think is the consensus
[0:49:32] <DistantPower> also DRG got the damage buff apply on the AoE combo now
[0:49:33] <+Masked_Hero_Lucky> I need to run this dungeon more, it has hats Viera can wear. Or at least, they can wear the fending cap, not 100% on the others
[0:49:34] <%xephhq> like MCH
[0:49:41] <%Shikari21> i hated new nin lvl 90 but im used to it now
[0:49:45] <@QueequegTheater> DRG was already great
[0:49:54] <@QueequegTheater> They just did some QoL
[0:49:56] <%RealThiele> MCH i do wish heat blast worked a bit different
[0:50:01] <%Dakuu75> lol
[0:50:04] <%valriot> LUL
[0:50:06] <%NopeBadguy> oh that's just the final days
[0:50:08] <cartakus> What happens eith summoner in next spancion? Another big monster like bahamut and bird?
[0:50:08] <%Baljhet> rooScream
[0:50:09] <Teneb0r> Doggies are so cute! :3
[0:50:12] <%Dakuu75> controller is screaming "PLEASE, KILL ME~!"
[0:50:13] <%UvBenServed> psaDogchamp
[0:50:20] <%InternetShis> Baby
[0:50:24] <@QueequegTheater> "END MY PAIN"
[0:50:25] <+Fetrigon> good drg sucks anyway. Message provided by MNK Gang
[0:50:29] <GilliamYaeger> @SaltyAzteca There's a timer, but you can generally take your time.
[0:50:38] <%RealThiele> i hope for SMN the next step they do is alternate gemstone summon so you get shit like Ramuh and Shiva
[0:50:42] <+SeventhVice> so glad they  JUST added it
[0:50:48] <%dankjerri> oh man that does sound rad
[0:50:49] <GilliamYaeger> It's pretty lenient.
[0:50:51] <SaltyAzteca> @gilliamyaeger alright cool, thanks dude
[0:50:53] <%NopeBadguy> something about "the rumble helps me play" makes me think of people turning the controller as they move
[0:50:55] <ygtidal> mmk became my favorite dps
[0:50:55] <@QueequegTheater> @fetrigon Have fun doing less damage with harder positionals Kappa
[0:50:58] <Zukozai> All I wish for is to be able to use cool DRK helmets on my bunny boy
[0:51:04] <%JoshManVGH> Blood Of The Dragon and Enochian changes where fucking next level for those classes
[0:51:17] <%RealThiele> ye no Enochian is great
[0:51:17] <Tomschiii> for a second i thought the controller sounds nice to have, but forgot that i am actually with k+m
[0:51:24] <+Masked_Hero_Lucky> It's super flashy
[0:51:27] <%Alazull> psaBig
[0:51:28] <Khester824> BIG ANIMS
[0:51:31] <+Fetrigon> @queequegtheater woolieDATTEBAYO of course
[0:51:32] <rei0> i actually don't like it, it's too flashy
[0:51:36] <funkerbuster> Enjoy your non damaging gap closers, monks
[0:51:37] <%JoshManVGH> The level 90 button RPR gets is huge
[0:51:37] <frontshuv> wait until the 90 ability
[0:51:38] <cartakus> Chunky
[0:51:40] <%GIGA255> I would keep rumble on if it weren't for the fact that it rumbled every time the sound effect plays for flying past something on a mount. it was too irritating.
[0:51:41] <%DianaTheAscian> it's so flashy I love it
[0:51:48] <%NopeBadguy> you're high
[0:51:49] <%RealThiele> i mean its no titan summon LUL
[0:51:50] <Teneb0r> I played a lot of WoW in my day and this is 1000x more beautiful...
[0:51:50] <@QueequegTheater> The sound design is also fucking great
[0:51:53] <%count_bob> Wait how did SAM get nerfed?
[0:52:00] <@JustinianKnight> should have to get The Reaper title
[0:52:02] <cartakus> why?
[0:52:05] <Sol_Install> it's big... but wat ifi... bigger
[0:52:06] <Zukozai> Zenos LOVES plants
[0:52:07] <%Dakuu75> they like their plants~ lol
[0:52:07] <%Visorak6> KILL
[0:52:09] <+Fetrigon> LUL
[0:52:10] <@QueequegTheater> @count_bob Reaper is higher DPS and isn't a selfish DPS
[0:52:16] <GilliamYaeger> ANGRY BOTANISTS
[0:52:18] <Keninrebo> Botanists that chose violence
[0:52:19] <%GarbageNirvana> Pissed off botanists
[0:52:22] <%crimsonharvest> the Exdeath counter squad
[0:52:22] <@QueequegTheater> So SAM is a bad choice
[0:52:23] <LittleBigQuebec> that's the actual lore
[0:52:23] <%Ynkubus_> They're angry farmers from garlemald
[0:52:23] <%Baljhet> @count_bob the only thing I can think of is you can't buff the double iai skills anymore
[0:52:24] <cartakus> Coool?
[0:52:25] <%dankjerri> zenos only did people genocide, not plant genocide
[0:52:26] <dan_g_v> question since I don't actually play FF, is Pat levelling all the other jobs he dind't play, or what is it?
[0:52:27] <%Alazull> Botanists that became assassins
[0:52:27] <LittleBigQuebec> garlean farmers
[0:52:28] <%RealThiele> jack my nodes ill jack you up
[0:52:31] <LittleBigQuebec> that got mad
[0:52:32] <%NopeBadguy> yes
[0:52:35] <%walternatorz> they have a party buff
[0:52:36] <TurtlesAndTentacles> is pat saying botanist or VOTnist
[0:52:37] <%DeadStage> Reaper has a regen for the party and a damage buff
[0:52:37] <%Divryne> 3% damange buff
[0:52:37] <%NopeBadguy> reaper has a damage buff and a party shield @PatStaresAt
[0:52:37] <+BuckChuckman> Woke up from the flower bed and chose violence
[0:52:37] <Teneb0r> "Instead of reaping plants, im going to REAP LIVES!"
[0:52:38] <%JohnAtDawn> They have two raid buff dude?
[0:52:39] <%RocketBarrel> they have a shield
[0:52:40] <@JustinianKnight> its got one party buff
[0:52:40] <%valriot> arcane circle
[0:52:41] <%barrakuta371> Botanists that woke up and chose violence
[0:52:41] <%VioletHeart> Arcane Circle.
[0:52:42] <animaturgy> AoE Hot and damage buff
[0:52:43] <%BlueLunecy> Arcane Circle
[0:52:43] <+Masked_Hero_Lucky> Arcane circle
[0:52:43] <LoreKeeper_Thal> repaer has raid buffs
[0:52:43] <%PMAvers> They spent too long doing Restoration gathering for points, and went mad.
[0:52:45] <%DianaTheAscian> a baby heal I guess?
[0:52:45] <%afronooch> sam dont
[0:52:46] <%Aeoneth> Arcane Circle?
[0:52:47] <%dankjerri> iunno, what do your tooltips say
[0:52:48] <%GarbageNirvana> It has a party buff
[0:52:48] <%VioletHeart> Samurai and Black Mage don't have party buffs.
[0:52:48] <@QueequegTheater> Arcane Circle
[0:52:49] <frontshuv> they have a shield if popped it gives everyone a regen
[0:52:50] <Blank9> it has a raid buff and shield/regen
[0:52:50] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt reaper has a party damage buff and a party shield
[0:52:50] <LoreKeeper_Thal> SAM doesn't
[0:52:51] <FelixAyada> sam/blm don't
[0:52:51] <%walternatorz> sam, mch, blm don't
[0:52:51] <%RocketBarrel> SAM doesnt have party buff
[0:52:52] <%InternetShis> It has a shield passer and a 3% damage buff
[0:52:53] <LoreKeeper_Thal> LUL
[0:52:53] <@JustinianKnight> and a healing shield kinda
[0:52:53] <%Akizea> arcane circle is REALLLLY good
[0:52:55] <+KawaiiJetty> well shield pop grants buff, arcane circle grants boost
[0:52:56] <Blank9> black mage doesn't
[0:52:58] <LoreKeeper_Thal> THIS IS WHY PEOPLE HATE SAM
[0:53:07] <%xephhq> it gets buff later
[0:53:07] <%JoshManVGH> Arcane Crest and Arcane Circle are great
[0:53:07] <%dankjerri> its no Mage's Ballad
[0:53:13] <%Akizea> arcane circle also gets a trait at 87 or 88
[0:53:13] <LittleBigQuebec> sam , mch and blm dont have party buff, thats why they are balanced to do more damage normally
[0:53:14] <Sol_Install> Killing weeds, killing things. Reaper: "all the same to me!"
[0:53:15] <%Dakuu75> @LoreKeeper_Thal aww...
[0:53:17] <%RealThiele> its a radiant light
[0:53:19] <%GIGA255> SAM, MCH, and BLM are the official selfish DPS, right?
[0:53:22] <%RocketBarrel> SAM brings big dick damage but now its not big dick damage
[0:53:24] <@QueequegTheater> SAM's utility is supposed to be raw damage but when it's not the highest DPS that becomes meaningless
[0:53:26] <Teneb0r> Im a bottom who loves casting. :u
[0:53:30] <%count_bob> @queequegtheater Ah. So it's not that SAM got nerfed, it's just reaper is way better.
[0:53:34] <@QueequegTheater> Yes
[0:53:37] <@QueequegTheater> Indirect nerf
[0:53:39] <%Divryne> Stop dooming people balance changes are coming in like 5 days and before Savage lol.
[0:53:43] <%RocketBarrel> MCH isn't selfish really. it has a shield
[0:53:43] <%count_bob> Shame.
[0:53:46] <%xephhq> MCH has tactician
[0:53:51] <%Divryne> It's always like this at the start of every expansion.
[0:53:54] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt arcane crest can also spread to party, so they have a party utility AND a party damage buff AND does more damage outright
[0:53:56] <%RealThiele> yea tactician is a decent 10%
[0:54:01] <%GIGA255> DRG aoes are so satisfying now, I'm sticking with em
[0:54:02] <%dankjerri> but who plays MCH
[0:54:07] <funkerbuster> damage debuff is a party buff Kappa
[0:54:08] <@QueequegTheater> @RocketBarrel That doesn't mean it's not selfish. It has no partywide damage buff
[0:54:13] <%RealThiele> @dankjerri :(
[0:54:14] <LittleBigQuebec> yeah but tactician is not a dps party buff, it's a deffensive party buff and everyone has them
[0:54:17] <%xephhq> @dankjerri me lol
[0:54:17] <%count_bob> Still like SAM but I hope they get buffed
[0:54:17] <%RocketBarrel> true
[0:54:19] <+RowenCleric> I love how this guy puts the weakness to his attacks here
[0:54:20] <%GIGA255> MCH is my second fav DPS
[0:54:31] <@QueequegTheater> @LittleBigQuebec DRG doesn't LUL
[0:54:34] <%RealThiele> reaping the shins
[0:54:35] <%xephhq> MCh is simple and intuitive
[0:54:35] <+wizard_of_diamonds> OMG I looked away and thought it was some sort of perspective trick, that was wild
[0:54:44] <%Gogogolem> Reaper: What if I used those assholes as fertilizer.
[0:54:47] <LittleBigQuebec> @LittleBigQuebec feint
[0:54:51] <+Masked_Hero_Lucky> The screen shake on Gluttony feels so good
[0:54:57] <%RocketBarrel> SAM is getting changed dw. 5.0 SAM was fuckin garbage until they changed Shoha
[0:55:04] <%dankjerri> i wish the jobs were more distinct in being either good or bad to play for me, it makes picking a main quite difficult. i lament this often
[0:55:08] <%crimsonharvest> This is how the did lugae? he was such a nothing in the original haha
[0:55:14] <%RealThiele> Yo chat aside from roulettes whats a fast way to max out poetics
[0:55:33] <%RocketBarrel> Wonderous Tails
[0:55:37] <funkerbuster> you can unfrog? DansGame
[0:55:38] <%dankjerri> raids?
[0:55:43] <%NopeBadguy> @LittleBigQuebec the only dps with party defensive buffs are summoner's phoenix regen, ranged defense cds, reaper's arcane crest, and monk's mantra
[0:55:43] <%JoshManVGH> @patstaresat at 84 you can pop Arcane Creat before stack damage or party wide damage, and when it pops the party gets a 100 potency Heal over Time. And every DPS can Feint for Tankbusters now.
[0:55:44] <%dankjerri> oh, and tails
[0:55:48] <@JustinianKnight> Blue Mage Carnival for poetics
[0:55:54] <%Archmortal> @RocketBarrel is it getting changed more or do you mean the 6.0 changes?  SAM seems in a really good place right now
[0:56:00] <PhilanthropyG> So glad he never used Reverse Gas
[0:56:04] <%NopeBadguy> oh right and feint/addle
[0:56:07] <+KawaiiJetty> Eureka, bozja, wonderous tails, blu mage carnival + weekly challenges
[0:56:20] <%RealThiele> thanks all
[0:56:30] <%GIGA255> 100 potency heal is worse than a potion ;_;
[0:56:31] <Blank9> a regen stack in particular
[0:56:38] <cartakus> Balanced
[0:56:42] <%DeadStage> Are you excited for a new Deep Dungeon this expac
[0:56:43] <%NopeBadguy> feint does a small debuff for magic and addle does a small debuff for phys
[0:56:45] <Blank9> 100 per tic
[0:56:50] <%JoshManVGH> Every Melee DPS I should say
[0:56:51] <@QueequegTheater> the 6000 HP pot is like a 300 potency heal anyway lmao
[0:56:51] <SinisterBroccoli> it's 100 pot regen
[0:56:51] <%dankjerri> theyre adding a lot of partymember TB mitigation, i wonder if that means theyll just kill you
[0:56:57] <%GarbageNirvana> So I don't remember Anima's aesthetic being so...meat
[0:56:57] <%Saunt> only 10% HP though
[0:56:58] <@JustinianKnight> baby ver
[0:56:58] <LittleBigQuebec> it's a 500 pot total heal as a regen
[0:57:05] <LittleBigQuebec> it's not nothing
[0:57:08] <@QueequegTheater> LUL
[0:57:08] <+SuperFineButtHairs> SuperFineButtHairs subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months! psaDab psaDab psaDab love ya, ya ginger goblin psaDab psaDab psaDab
[0:57:09] <%RocketBarrel> @archmortal SAM is currently 3rd in melee DPS when it brings nothing to the table. According to the devs, classes that don't have party buffs are supposed to be top dps
[0:57:11] <+Fetrigon> psaFist
[0:57:14] <%dankjerri> they made a DPS DRK pat, i thought you'd like this
[0:57:17] <%InternetShis> DRK die
[0:57:20] <@QueequegTheater> DRK gets put even further into the cuckshed
[0:57:25] <%JoshManVGH> Every Job does DRK better, apparently.
[0:57:31] <%NopeBadguy> so let's sum up, reaper has a party survival utility, a party damage buff, AND does the most damage outright
[0:57:31] <cartakus> DRK got shaft
[0:57:35] <%dankjerri> yes
[0:57:39] <+SaphronBlackbourne> DPS DRK is all I wanted from Reaper tbh
[0:57:39] <%NopeBadguy> this class is OVERTUNED
[0:57:44] <@QueequegTheater> @NopeBadguy But DRG looks cooler though
[0:57:45] <PhilanthropyG> Gonna take awhile before getting used to the aesthetics of each dungeon. Theyre pretty heavy places.
[0:57:46] <%crimsonharvest> is reaper's LB single or aoe
[0:57:56] <%JoshManVGH> Aww
[0:58:00] <%dankjerri> DRG is very cool melee dps
[0:58:00] <%NopeBadguy> @QueequegTheater  not when they're dead on the floor
[0:58:00] <@QueequegTheater> I AM NOT ON COPIUM SCYTHES ARE DUMB >:(
[0:58:02] <cartakus> Meh don't worry about it
[0:58:03] <%Agami23> dude WHM got a TBN too, its great
[0:58:04] <%InternetShis> Every DPS has become a better DPS than DRK's only saving tank grace: DPS
[0:58:04] <%RocketBarrel> every melee lb is single
[0:58:07] <%SuperFineButtHairs> big mad psaPat psaFist
[0:58:09] <%Archmortal> @RocketBarrel OH, I see.  Yeah I meant mechanically, wasn't aware their dps was struggling like that
[0:58:12] <%dankjerri> my favorite probably. then monk.
[0:58:21] <@QueequegTheater> Yes
[0:58:22] <Blank9> more arcane circles
[0:58:31] <@QueequegTheater> You need an entire bar of ACs
[0:58:35] <%DianaTheAscian> y?
[0:58:35] <%Warbot40> Man I'm still bummed Anima is just a dungeon boss. Feels like there's zero chance for a more elaborate or difficult version of him.
[0:58:43] <Blank9> @QueequegTheater don't worry their tomestone scythe is just a pinwheel on a stick
[0:58:45] <%JoshManVGH> Arcane Circle gets popped all the time once at 88
[0:58:59] <%dankjerri> oh we'll get Anima Extreme for sure
[0:59:07] <@QueequegTheater> @Blank9 Scaevan is literally Crescent Rose from RWBY though
[0:59:15] <%Mekhet09> 3 hour queues things are getting better.
[0:59:15] <+Fetrigon> @warbot40 yeah they lied big time LUL
[0:59:16] <%dankjerri> thats GOTTA be somewhere they didnt make that good model for nothing
[0:59:23] <Shiibbae> pat i love the casual ffxiv streams i hope theyre here fora  while its v comfy uwu
[0:59:24] <LoreKeeper_Thal> they can make an Anima focused trial, like Varis
[0:59:32] <%G_Thunders> I actually thought it was pretty cool how the trials are only god-beings now. It reinforces that we’ve actually gotten stronger in universe so primals are just quick dungeon fights
[0:59:33] <Shiibbae> also i learn stuff too!!!!!
[0:59:44] <$laurenzthezero> I hope Reaper gets a Scythe for hades like gunbreakers got for shinryu
[0:59:44] <%JoshManVGH> Free Shade mode, it's fucking stellar!
[0:59:44] <%xephhq> MNK mains in chat, how do you feel about your class at 90?
[0:59:46] <Teneb0r> FFX Anima! Wooooo!
[0:59:48] <%NopeBadguy> you know what class i really want? arithmetician
[0:59:54] <Blank9> reaper at max level is silly, you're doing like 8 gcds before your actual 1-2-3 combo
[1:00:02] <+Fetrigon> @g_thunders ye
[1:00:05] <@QueequegTheater> @NopeBadguy That exists, it's called SMN
[1:00:07] <LoreKeeper_Thal> @NopeBadguy i feel that would literally break the game
[1:00:12] <%Dakuu75> omg, Anima is so fucking cool
[1:00:14] <+SaphronBlackbourne> Can you do positionals on these kinds of bosses, I never played a melee
[1:00:17] <%crimsonharvest> the way they've reinterpreted the FF4 magic casting sound effects for this is freaking me out man
[1:00:18] <%dankjerri> gambler job when
[1:00:20] <TurtlesAndTentacles> No evil shall escape my sight?
[1:00:23] <Teneb0r> Seymour gonna pop up and start whining? I hope so...
[1:00:23] <cartakus> Oh the salt is increasing
[1:00:28] <Blank9> I want geomancer, urianger even has lithomancer as a trust
[1:00:28] <%NopeBadguy> i also really want gambler
[1:00:32] <%NopeBadguy> gambler and arithmetician
[1:00:35] <%Visorak6> @xephhq It's really not that different from how it used to be, you just lost all your weaves for less positionals and a gimmick every 40 seconds
[1:00:39] <%Warbot40> Magus sisters also got screwed too. The fight was good but feels like they could do so much more with them for a boss.
[1:00:39] <PhilanthropyG> 90 SAM is ridiculous. Always doing a high damage move between quick 3 hit bar combos to do another focus attack. Slicing and Dicing
[1:00:44] <asagi_ryuu> @SaphronBlackbourne bosses like these have no positional requirements theyre omnidirectional
[1:00:47] <%Mekhet09> I want time mage before either of those.
[1:00:50] <Blank9> also blitzball as range physical dps
[1:00:55] <%JoshManVGH> It's the Job he wants It's just the wrong Job.
[1:00:57] <%DianaTheAscian> I was a bit disappointed that Anima wasn't a trail tbh
[1:00:57] <%Dakuu75> YEAH-YEAH-YEAH
[1:01:04] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt My first tank run of this, the healer and mage both died at 48% and me (WAR) and the RPR were able to completely burn it down on our own
[1:01:06] <%dankjerri> Onion Knight job
[1:01:15] <%Warbot40> I'd love time mage as a tank.
[1:01:30] <%Dakuu75> he gonna do the ORA-ORA~!! YEAH~!!!
[1:01:31] <PhilanthropyG> A mage Tank in general would be nice
[1:01:37] <GilliamYaeger> @Blank9 Geomancer is Astro, the AST quests go into detail about how functionally there is no difference between the two practices save that one looks up and the other looks down.
[1:01:38] <%GIGA255> I'm already an onion knight, though.
[1:01:43] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Isnt Onion knight just Red Mage?
[1:01:43] <Reisadan> BIG EPIC BATT-gotta manage those menus yo
[1:01:47] <%dankjerri> @philanthropyg steiner but without Vivi
[1:01:52] <cartakus> So is sage as good as reaper in it's own part?
[1:01:55] <%xephhq> @xephhq looked like it, thanks for the response
[1:02:06] <PhilanthropyG> I REALLY want a spellsword class one day.
[1:02:06] <%Warbot40> Like Time Mage or Mystic/Rune Knight would be neat.
[1:02:06] <@QueequegTheater> @cartakus It's good but not busted like RPR
[1:02:17] <GilliamYaeger> @cartakus SCH's probably better from what it seems
[1:02:20] <%Dakuu75> YEYEYEYEYE
[1:02:20] <%GIGA255> Onion Knight has always been the "it sucks at first, but huge stat gains near 89-100, + can use wide variety of gear"
[1:02:20] <Zeif00> I still can't believe Anima is just a end dungeon fight
[1:02:24] <%NopeBadguy> we memed on it but the sch speed boost is actually really nice
[1:02:25] <%GIGA255> clas
[1:02:26] <+Fetrigon> @philanthropyg red mage
[1:02:26] <%Mekhet09> It's getting fucking nerfed.
[1:02:27] <%orbulon> almost too good
[1:02:27] <Blank9> sage is like the whm of barrier healing
[1:02:29] <+SaphronBlackbourne> I want magic melee (RDM doesn't count)
[1:02:32] <BlueTunicLink> RPR is really good, but is still really simple.
[1:02:35] <Blank9> it's selfish like whm but insanely effective
[1:02:35] <%PMAvers> Sage requires thought.
[1:02:36] <cartakus> Wow that busted huh?
[1:02:37] <%Dakuu75> oh, that wasn't quite as epic as the FFX Overdrive but, ok
[1:02:41] <%valriot> No Sage also good, all the healers are pretty balanced
[1:02:47] <PhilanthropyG> Red mage is magic >  phys, but spellsword is phys > magic
[1:02:50] <Daniel_Is_I> RPR is really easy to play and it's neck-and-neck for top DPS alongside MNK and SAM
[1:02:50] <%DianaTheAscian> It's to huge
[1:02:55] <@QueequegTheater> @cartakus It has a party defensive, party shield, party damage buff and top DPS
[1:02:56] <+Masked_Hero_Lucky> But I like fast dungeon clears
[1:03:00] <%dankjerri> i dont wanna see the world first race dominated by RPR
[1:03:01] <%JoshManVGH> SGE is alright, but it requires you really pay attention and make a lot of decisions.
[1:03:09] <%Mekhet09> @Daniel_Is_I It actually easily beats them out
[1:03:10] <%GIGA255> Fairy glamour for SCH would bring me back in. Alas.
[1:03:16] <%DeadStage> So long as BLM stays at the highest DPS the world is right. No other job deserves that spot.
[1:03:17] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[1:03:17] <%Dakuu75> does the camera zoom out more if you lock onto the boss?
[1:03:17] <%JoshManVGH> But I'm also new to healing so I might be over playing it
[1:03:21] <%GarbageNirvana> Spellsword would be rad to see in this game but idk where they'd even fit it in
[1:03:22] <+Wolfstriker121> yeah as a main for that class..it needs a nerf a bit
[1:03:34] <+Wolfstriker121> and im not gonna even be mad about it
[1:03:36] <$laurenzthezero> Are dungeons the way to go for leveling *0 to 90?
[1:03:37] <%Fenrirlives> Cheer500 how's your evening going Pat? Mom and I finished driving to Fort worth Texas for funeral stuff, and I'm exhausted! I was also wondering what major releases you plan on streaming in early 2022 if any games stick out to you right now?
[1:03:40] <%G_Thunders> But Zenos wouldn’t have picked reaper if it wasn’t the best job.
[1:03:42] <%GIGA255> PLD and RDM are alreayd spellswordsmen
[1:03:45] <@QueequegTheater> @GarbageNirvana RDM already fills that niche unfortunately
[1:03:45] <XyraFhoan> both jobs are great, I legit think sage+scholar is a way viable comp because even if they can't overlap gcd shields they can still stack their % mitigation buffs
[1:03:50] <Blank9> paladin and red mage seem to do mystic knight too much already
[1:03:59] <%hoodedlefty> That’s how I felt about SMN when it nerfed twice in a row in 5.X
[1:04:02] <%walternatorz> anima card
[1:04:02] <%dankjerri> bravered
[1:04:05] <%JoshManVGH> Yeyeye!
[1:04:07] <PhilanthropyG> Not the same. Spellsword, think Steiner from FF9 if he could do it himself.
[1:04:11] <%Agami23> i hope they just buff everything else instead of nerfing it
[1:04:13] <%Warbot40> @Blank9 true
[1:04:18] <%dankjerri> lame axe
[1:04:20] <@QueequegTheater> @Agami23 They won't
[1:04:24] <%GIGA255> Reap those spoils, pat
[1:04:27] <PhilanthropyG> or Bravely Default.
[1:04:30] <Justlaxy> I am in que waiting to live in zadnor for exp farming.
[1:04:30] <%Mekhet09> I want a dot mage now that SMN isn't that. I also want another summoner rework it's too boring now.
[1:04:31] <Zeif00> All the gear from this dungeon looks great
[1:04:33] <+SaphronBlackbourne> Whirligig Saw
[1:04:35] <@QueequegTheater> Savage/Ultimate need to be a certain level of difficult
[1:04:36] <Teneb0r> Seymour:"Mother! Noooooooo!"
[1:04:40] <Blank9> blitzball ranged dps or bust
[1:04:44] <cartakus> So if warrior can self heal so much can you make a duty with 3 reapers?
[1:04:51] <%Warbot40> Time Mage Tank and Blitzball player Ranged DPS is what I want.
[1:04:57] <%dankjerri> @blank9 THIS GUY GETS IT
[1:05:02] <%G_Thunders> Nerfing one class vs buffing and balancing 19 classes is kind of an easy choice
[1:05:03] <Zeif00> Big Mac Pat
[1:05:05] <%xephhq> I like RPR cause it makes me feel like I play a melee MCH
[1:05:08] <@QueequegTheater> @cartakus Would unironically work
[1:05:09] <cthulewd> what is that gun?
[1:05:15] <%furiousfurioso> I heard you had to be in a party for the limited thing to work
[1:05:22] <%GIGA255> Imperial sympathizer, Pat
[1:05:22] <Blank9> warrior could definitely get through any dungeon with any 3 others, whatever they are
[1:05:25] <%orbulon> i think all of the dungeon gear this expansion look good
[1:05:26] <%Fenrirlives> Time Mage would Own, especially if they use the Bravely Default design
[1:05:28] <%Saunt> @PatStaresAt Limited Roulette only works a party of two or more
[1:05:35] <%afronooch> hi rudy
[1:05:36] <cartakus> Nice
[1:05:36] <%dankjerri> you need to find a Mountie hat
[1:05:39] <%Aeoneth> Then WAR can upgrade from angry screaming to ANGRY RUSSIAN SCREAMING
[1:05:46] <%DianaTheAscian> I love him
[1:05:50] <Blank9> I made it through the 87 dungeon first time through with no healer, they dc'd at the start of the first pull
[1:05:54] <%GIGA255> Gief Gravy
[1:05:55] <softbirby> AMONGUS
[1:05:56] <%Fenrirlives> Is she Mrs. Claus?
[1:05:57] <AoiRob> hi elmo bye elmo
[1:05:58] <%PMAvers> Speaking of poorly behaved little helpers
[1:06:10] <cartakus> There he goes
[1:06:12] <TurtlesAndTentacles> So glams are just something a skin you put over your items to look like how ever you want?
[1:06:12] <bamberfool> PogChamp
[1:06:14] <%Dakuu75> does this holiday event get you anything good?
[1:06:18] <%NopeBadguy> ?????
[1:06:19] <Getyer> this man is comedically cursed
[1:06:23] <%NopeBadguy> did zangief shit on the floor
[1:06:24] <%Aeoneth> @Blank9 man what is it about 87 that does that I wonder.  Had the same situation happen to me
[1:06:29] <%2DSuperiority> Elmo puke?
[1:06:31] <+RelikaNox> I look away for two seconds
[1:06:32] <%GIGA255> two minions
[1:06:34] <+RelikaNox> wtf happened
[1:06:38] <%Fenrirlives> @turtlesandtentacles yup Fashion is the true endgame
[1:06:43] <@QueequegTheater> monkaS
[1:06:59] <TurtlesAndTentacles> @Fenrirlives awesome
[1:07:05] <%GIGA255> Onion Knight glamour is best glamour
[1:07:13] <@QueequegTheater> @TurtlesAndTentacles The hardest content in the game rewards you with a level 1 weapon glam and nothing else
[1:07:16] <@QueequegTheater> For bragging rights
[1:07:30] <%dankjerri> bruh
[1:07:39] <%Fenrirlives> I swear there's an outfit that's just the Drip one of the Devs wears
[1:07:39] <DusK_The_Stray> I've been begging for a time mage healer since forever, but a time mage tank sounds badass
[1:07:40] <%Dakuu75> I wish you could mix glams from different job sets
[1:07:49] <%GIGA255> Those weapons aren't level 1 weapon glam. weren't they BiS when they came out?
[1:07:49] <TurtlesAndTentacles> @QueequegTheater That is insane
[1:07:56] <cartakus> I don't like those shinny weapons
[1:08:03] <@QueequegTheater> @TurtlesAndTentacles Just wait until you see how long the guide for that fight is
[1:08:13] <@QueequegTheater> The google doc is 70 pages long lmao
[1:08:16] <%NopeBadguy> it was paige
[1:08:20] <%DianaTheAscian> Damn it Paige
[1:08:20] <%barrakuta371> Elmo?
[1:08:27] <%Guardiansaiyan> psaSmug
[1:08:28] <%Fenrirlives> I for one want a Chocobo Knight or FFTactics Judge Class
[1:08:32] <PhilanthropyG> I half suspect an Alchemist class in the near future, under a different name to not confuse with  Hand Alchemist.
[1:08:33] <TurtlesAndTentacles> @QueequegTheater BibleThump
[1:08:36] <%GIGA255> when does Zangief get a reindeer outfit?
[1:08:51] <@QueequegTheater> @TurtlesAndTentacles There's a reason TEA weapons look so good
[1:08:52] <%NopeBadguy> your gun is FLOATING off your back
[1:09:07] <%Dakuu75> an Auspice?
[1:09:15] <%Guardiansaiyan> @NopeBadguy that means its working
[1:09:25] <Demonkyo21> Sup pat! Hope your night is going good!
[1:09:25] <Daniel_Is_I> Auspices are from the Four Lords questline
[1:09:27] <%Nobrev> is that the squirrel that covered up thancred's junk that one time
[1:09:29] <Estwilde> PogChamp
[1:09:39] <%GIGA255> putting the awwww in auspice
[1:09:43] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt You only get option 3 if you did Four Lords
[1:09:49] <TurtlesAndTentacles> @QueequegTheater Because you go through hell
[1:09:53] <@QueequegTheater> Yes
[1:10:07] <%Puhff> Yeah I didn't have that 3rd option :(
[1:10:11] <%2DSuperiority> that means it can turn into a sexy lady, got it
[1:10:12] <%PMAvers> Be more like Nunu
[1:10:16] <+Kyma1020> I can't believe it's just Rudolph but Yetis
[1:10:16] <%kyh9> RELATABLE
[1:10:17] <%Fenrirlives> soooooo adorable
[1:10:18] <%crimsonharvest> holiday cheer is stored in the snowballs
[1:10:19] <%Dakuu75> making fun of him for his tiny balls... I bet Pat can relate
[1:10:22] <@QueequegTheater> @TurtlesAndTentacles It has the coolest mechanic ever though, you get a shadow clone of yourself dodging mechanics in the future that you have to follow at one point
[1:10:25] <Daniel_Is_I> I've only had Rudy for five minutes but if anything happened to him I'd kill everyone in Gridania and then myself.
[1:10:27] <SaltyAzteca> why are the animals here so cute tho
[1:10:30] <Teneb0r> I wish that Summoners could summon Anima. :s
[1:10:53] <%Dakuu75> @Teneb0r I fucking know, right
[1:10:56] <%Nobrev> stomp the rudy
[1:10:58] <%GIGA255> they can. an anima minion
[1:10:58] <PhilanthropyG> lol turn the SMN LB3 into Anima
[1:11:08] <%UvBenServed> BibleThump
[1:11:11] <Teneb0r> Not the same
[1:11:13] <Estwilde> He's out getting beers
[1:11:19] <%Fenrirlives> Summoner should get Odin, Ramuh, Shiva, and Alexander at some point
[1:11:20] <Teneb0r> But I'll take a pet over nothing
[1:11:44] <TurtlesAndTentacles> @QueequegTheater That sounds cool as hell. Youre really making me want to play
[1:11:52] <%Guardiansaiyan> Again (again)
[1:11:55] <Daniel_Is_I> How many Christmases have you saved, Pat?
[1:11:59] <%solracc25> Tired bunny will save not-christmas
[1:12:10] <@QueequegTheater> @TurtlesAndTentacles Too late, they stopped selling the game
[1:12:11] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Pat why no wear santa outfit?
[1:12:14] <@QueequegTheater> Too many players Kappa
[1:12:20] <%PMAvers> "Go jungle and gank top."
[1:12:26] <%skeletonmilk> hi pat reaper is very very fun
[1:12:26] <PhilanthropyG> "well thats 5 I saved, versus 8 I ruined, 3 were kind of a draw..."
[1:12:28] <%2DSuperiority> I can't wait for Halloween, you know, the one after Christmas
[1:12:29] <Demonkyo21> Yoshi P is suffering from success
[1:12:30] <Teneb0r> Is this Anima cameo or is it relevant to the goings on?
[1:12:31] <%Guardiansaiyan> @Daniel_Is_I ffxiv has been on for 8 years so...8 christmases?
[1:12:34] <+Ed_The_Crimson> FFXIV: Where the War on Christmas is actually real
[1:12:35] <%Fenrirlives> PUT ROCKS IN THEM
[1:12:39] <TurtlesAndTentacles> OH COME ON BibleThump WutFace
[1:12:41] <%Puhff> @Fenrirlives they explain in the SMN job quests that those other Summons are too powerful for the mortal body to chanel. The only reason we can channel Baha is cuz of 2.0
[1:12:46] <@QueequegTheater> @TurtlesAndTentacles LUL
[1:12:52] <AoiRob> THROW BRICKS INSTEAD
[1:12:53] <Teneb0r> $hit Kids.... :s

[1:14:16] <TurtlesAndTentacles> @QueequegTheater Of course this game is super successful right when I say screw it lets go
[1:14:27] <Daniel_Is_I> Is that the 83 dungeon gun?
[1:14:28] <%Visorak6> what's the name of the gun again?
[1:14:32] <Estwilde> imperial magitek?
[1:14:39] <Teneb0r> We need diabeetus and we need it NOW!
[1:14:44] <cartakus> Au ra(?) males have such wide thighs, I don't get it the girls don't get that as much
[1:14:47] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> this story is pretty fucking cute
[1:14:54] <@QueequegTheater> @TurtlesAndTentacles Jebaited
[1:14:58] <%GIGA255> I think that's the Cryptlurker gun. level 80 tomestone weapon
[1:14:59] <PhilanthropyG> wait
[1:15:03] <%walternatorz> have you been on the bike mount since you've got the haptic feedback?
[1:15:03] <PhilanthropyG> diabeetus plays this game?
[1:15:26] <%GIGA255> Augmented Tomestone gear outclasses Endwalker gear until level 85.
[1:15:30] <Kylardsa> Hey yall having a terrible day sony and square just stole my copy of endwalker and both refuse to help
[1:15:36] <%Guardiansaiyan> its snowing!
[1:15:38] <Daniel_Is_I> Pat it's literally snowing right now LUL
[1:15:45] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Yeah, I blame you guys and Pat for baiting me @QueequegTheater
[1:15:52] <%Guardiansaiyan> lol
[1:15:59] <%shurtal> that's tree jizz
[1:15:59] <%hoodedlefty> Weird thought but how small are lalafell children even
[1:16:04] <+Kyma1020> That's Elemental Dandruff
[1:16:08] <Teneb0r> Old Grandia
[1:16:10] <%Guardiansaiyan> the snow is making the frickin trees GAY
[1:16:11] <%Zundelle> the elementals do be bitches that's true
[1:16:11] <PhilanthropyG> it is canonical the elements like to troll.
[1:16:12] <%Guardiansaiyan> lol
[1:16:17] <%GIGA255> Gridania reminds me of New Hampshire mountain towns.
[1:16:17] <%walternatorz> are the elementals causing snow in ul'dah too?
[1:16:18] <KenzBurp> fuck the elementals
[1:16:18] <cartakus> The're potato form
[1:16:19] <+Ed_The_Crimson> They should let us use mounts in Gridania
[1:16:22] <%Nobrev> we could totally beat up the elementals
[1:16:22] <+Kyma1020> Cuz those fuckers are dryyyyy
[1:16:23] <%Rumbutt> all my homies hate Gridania
[1:16:27] <%shurtal> c'mon, war crimes Pat! War Crimes!
[1:16:29] <%DianaTheAscian> But trees Pat don't you love trees?
[1:16:31] <%DashXero> Gridania is a chore to navigate.
[1:16:31] <Teneb0r> Does Pat have the Anima Minion? I'd love to see it....
[1:16:34] <%Baljhet> you know I had always assumed the Elementals were primals but they just dropped that plotline
[1:16:38] <%NopeBadguy> "that's bullshit from the elementals" sounds like something someone denying climate change might say
[1:16:40] <TrollKing96> Does FFXIV have Santa or a Santa equivalent?
[1:16:43] <%Guardiansaiyan> @PatStaresAt why is Girdania most hated?
[1:16:43] <Demonkyo21> @DianaTheAscian Can't sleep. Trees wil leat people
[1:16:44] <%GarbageNirvana> I bet they could make Gridania one zone smaller
[1:16:48] <+ZipperHands> Sometimes I think Gridania alright and then I remember that they're racist to dark elves
[1:16:49] <PhilanthropyG> go carve grafitti on the great tree
[1:16:51] <%hoodedlefty> Just once can we have the festival somewhere else
[1:16:55] <%Baljhet> @TrollKing96 yes, he's ripped
[1:17:01] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> @TrollKing96 Yes
[1:17:02] <KenzBurp> @Guardiansaiyan they're shitty racists
[1:17:10] <%DianaTheAscian> @demonkyo21
[1:17:10] <%Guardiansaiyan> ooooh
[1:17:16] <%Guardiansaiyan> dang
[1:17:24] <cartakus> When are normal elfs not racist to dark ones?
[1:17:28] <%GarbageNirvana> That's that Ala Mhigan something or other
[1:17:34] <%Puhff> crimbus
[1:17:34] <Teneb0r> Wait until Rudy grows up and starts wrecking people's shit.
[1:17:40] <%Zundelle> super racists that are bottoms to tree spirits
[1:17:41] <%Puhff> i would die for rudy
[1:17:46] <%DashXero> Elves are racist to everybody.
[1:17:55] <%Visorak6> urianger???
[1:17:57] <%Guardiansaiyan> Which is best starter city? Limsa Liminsa?
[1:17:58] <%GIGA255> the only good elf is an elf wearing a turtleneck sweater
[1:17:58] <%Agami23> estinien sucks
[1:17:59] <PhilanthropyG> Urianger?
[1:18:00] <%shurtal> not Urianger?
[1:18:00] <%NopeBadguy> YOU FORGOT URIANGER
[1:18:01] <Daniel_Is_I> Edmont is good!
[1:18:05] <%Baljhet> at least Ishgard is getting over dragon bigotry
[1:18:06] <%kyh9> I wish I could be racist towards elves as a Roe
[1:18:07] <Zukozai> I could have sworn you were gonna say the only good elf is a dead one
[1:18:10] <+RowenCleric> and the twins?
[1:18:11] <%DianaTheAscian> @patstaresat and the twins???
[1:18:11] <%InternetShis> Uringer is a liar sometimes
[1:18:14] <Ralfclogs> and the twins?
[1:18:14] <@QueequegTheater> And Edmont FeelsBadMan
[1:18:15] <Estwilde> the machinist guy seems nice
[1:18:16] <Daniel_Is_I> Alisae and Alphinaud are Elezen too
[1:18:16] <KenzBurp> and they just let people die  "elementals said i cant heal you lol"
[1:18:18] <%GarbageNirvana> @Agami23 You take that back
[1:18:21] <%kyh9> Hey elves, let's have an arm wrestling competition
[1:18:21] <+RelikaNox> Francel and Edmont and Honoroit!
[1:18:22] <cartakus> lol
[1:18:23] <%VioletHeart> And the twins mom?
[1:18:23] <+Kyma1020> His original appearance made me think he was a tall Mi'Qote

[1:18:33] <%InternetShis> And Louisoix
[1:18:33] <%shurtal> Urianger isnt' an elf, he's a walking Shakespearean Lexicon
[1:18:35] <+omgthecheat> There are good elves and exactly 0 of them are from Gridania
[1:18:35] <%LeiaSkynoober> The twins mom is a milf
[1:18:36] <DirigibleDPlomo> and The Twins
[1:18:36] <Demonkyo21> @DianaTheAscian You rang?
[1:18:36] <%DashXero> Far outnumbered by the bad ones.
[1:18:38] <Demonkyo21> :D
[1:18:38] <%NopeBadguy> as long as they're not ishgardian
[1:18:39] <%InternetShis> And Ameliance
[1:18:39] <%Puhff> and their mom!
[1:18:40] <PhilanthropyG> Elves in high seats of power, 9 out of 10 matchup they suck.
[1:18:40] <Daniel_Is_I> Limsa
[1:18:43] <%Rumbutt> Uldah
[1:18:45] <%rumtumtugnutz> What about Alphinaud and Alisae?

[1:18:55] <%Fenrirlives> TILL SEA SWALLOWS ALL
[1:18:55] <%GarbageNirvana> limlom
[1:18:58] <%Archmortal> between the love of russian coats and "these are the good ones" idk man
[1:18:58] <Lashley> Limsa
[1:19:01] <Ralfclogs> Oh and Louisoix too
[1:19:01] <%count_bob> uldah
[1:19:03] <%InternetShis> Limsa is a sex pit
[1:19:04] <GilliamYaeger> Ul'dah is the most relevant story-wise
[1:19:04] <LoreKeeper_Thal> Limsa is the best one with the WORST crowd
[1:19:09] <%rumtumtugnutz> Ligma is alright
[1:19:11] <Daniel_Is_I> Do your best Rudy coxThump
[1:19:12] <%GIGA255> Till sea swallows y'all
[1:19:12] <%InternetShis> Ul'Dah is the only one with story
[1:19:14] <PhilanthropyG> Did all 5 rolequests thinking I would get something special before beating the game. NNNNOPE! Ah well, good to have 5 jobs at 90 now
[1:19:17] <ValkahRoctsteel> Limsa is both the best and worst
[1:19:18] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Half Elves are the best
[1:19:19] <%Warbot40> We can agree Gridania's the weakest.
[1:19:19] <+RelikaNox> LUL
[1:19:20] <cartakus> The twink and petite twins get to not be long neck
[1:19:22] <%Guardiansaiyan> okay! Thanks! VirtualHug <3
[1:19:28] <%Monkeyweed21> didnt Limsa steal all their land from the natives
[1:19:29] <GilliamYaeger> Limsa's the best actual city, Ul'dah's the best to actually START in
[1:19:31] <KenzBurp> limsa, so you can see the degeneracy right away
[1:19:34] <%Vanslainstreams> i just tried to click that duty finder pop up, fuck

[1:20:15] <Ralfclogs> that one depis
[1:20:18] <%furiousfurioso> coxJam
[1:20:21] <%walternatorz> The DPS knows what you did.
[1:20:23] <@CreepyPorpoise> u deserve it
[1:20:24] <Demonkyo21> PAT. YOU'RE A AWESOME PERSON
[1:20:28] <@CreepyPorpoise> scumbagging
[1:20:28] <gentlemanboxer> PATTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT
[1:20:30] <%InternetShis> BECAUSE CLASSIC DPS
[1:20:32] <Kain5707> tpyical dps
[1:20:37] <PhilanthropyG> fucked up dungeon #2
[1:20:43] <%Baljhet> he even stands in aoes. he has become the Ur DPS
[1:20:46] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> Cus your finding out things thats been in the same since 2.0
[1:20:49] <+wizard_of_diamonds> To cool for AOE Kappa
[1:21:23] <%Baljhet> is flamethrower worth using?
[1:21:28] <%GIGA255> Have you been doing your daily hunts, Pat? I was surprised how much EXP they give.
[1:21:33] <%brandonsbetow> why does some of the audio sound blown out, is my audio settings fucked?
[1:21:36] <pissdegaulle> no ogcds inbetween heat blasts, im gonna fucking puke
[1:21:40] <+omgthecheat> It is for 3+
[1:21:42] <+SaphronBlackbourne> IIRC Flamethrower is garbage
[1:21:45] <PhilanthropyG> I never know with Flamethrower. Seems good at the end of a combo, when you dont gotta move.
[1:21:53] <+emperri> that is twitch compression
[1:21:54] <%Visorak6> sounds fine to me on stream
[1:21:54] <%brandonsbetow> stream game audio
[1:22:09] <%brandonsbetow> some of the music sounds blown out
[1:22:10] <%brandonsbetow> thanks
[1:22:11] <+Aeogard> HI GAMERS
[1:22:15] <%GIGA255> Flamethrower is worth using if you can't use bowgun or bioblaster, and your hear meter is super low.
[1:22:16] <%LaughingCatt> Flamethrower is the "I need to take my hands away from the controller for 10 seconds" button. That is its purpose
[1:22:19] <%Baljhet> yeah, twitch is fucking with you
[1:22:20] <pissdegaulle> flamethrower is better than spread shot when you got nothing else
[1:22:26] <TheProtomanBlues> How much space disk is required to install FFXIV
[1:22:28] <DensityD> gamers with the Hard R
[1:22:40] <LoreKeeper_Thal> pat LOVES the goo
[1:22:46] <%brandonsbetow> alright, refreshing steam did it, that was weird though
[1:22:57] <+emperri> aimin' and maimin'
[1:23:09] <cartakus> Ye
[1:23:10] <+emperri> peloton btw
[1:23:10] <PhilanthropyG> I blinked when seeing these two here
[1:23:13] <LoreKeeper_Thal> @TheProtomanBlues depends how many expansions you have, but t's about 100GB if you have all of them
[1:23:37] <%GIGA255> I never equip new gear without slotting materia. It just feels wrong.
[1:23:41] <%MalekDracarus> Hey Pat, had to go dark on your vods cause EW spoils but want to let you know your tank advice helped a lot and now I’m trying to get through EW msq so I can have on in the background again. Also any tips on endgame GNB?
[1:23:46] <+Aeogard> lets go pat, triple weaving mch time
[1:24:06] <+emperri> tank advice: don't be drk
[1:24:21] <%RyTYoung> Chat what materia should I be equipping to a summoners gear?
[1:24:21] <LoreKeeper_Thal> THAT COOLDOWN IS SO GOOD NOW
[1:24:26] <LoreKeeper_Thal> god GNB rules
[1:24:29] <%DeadStage> GNB can't stop winning
[1:24:34] <LoreKeeper_Thal> and i don't even like gunblades that much
[1:24:35] <Kain5707> pro gamer
[1:24:36] <@SpaceCapnCrone> I've used it to save other people so many times too
[1:24:37] <+emperri> vuln stack andy
[1:24:41] <+RelikaNox> smh
[1:24:42] <TheProtomanBlues> @TheProtomanBlues Thanks, i downloaded the free trial a while back but havent installed it, wonder if im even able to now lol
[1:24:48] <%croxeye> don't worry, its a pro gamer stack tho
[1:24:50] <Zeif00> Kappa
[1:24:51] <PhilanthropyG> youre a range dps Pat. Youre a free bird
[1:24:51] <Kain5707> LUL
[1:24:56] <LoreKeeper_Thal> dead
[1:24:57] <HibikiYamada> the fact that gnb can recover from bolide by itself now is just
[1:24:58] <+RelikaNox> Kappa
[1:24:58] <HibikiYamada> amazing
[1:25:03] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Is Dark Knight really that bad? Wasnt it the highlight class for a whole Expansion?
[1:25:14] <PhilanthropyG> and with BRD, have imputs for days like youre playing Free Bird
[1:25:15] <cartakus> Oh HE DEAD
[1:25:16] <%GIGA255> In Canada, it's spelled Eh'ming
[1:25:20] <titsmaloy> It's the controller, it's corrupted your brains
[1:25:26] <LoreKeeper_Thal> @TurtlesAndTentacles it is, highest damaging tan right now in all ex trials
[1:25:40] <+emperri> dark knight isn't "bad", it just got almost nothing from 80-90 while pld, war, and gnb got buffed to the gills
[1:25:54] <%Chichen> all da hat
[1:26:00] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Oooooh
[1:26:01] <%Chichen> the only hats you can wear
[1:26:06] <KenzBurp> drk have big damage, lower sustainability, gotta trust your healers
[1:26:13] <%Baljhet> it is surprising how busy Bard gets, especially when you're trying to use your support skills
[1:26:13] <sirtommygunn> That means dark knight is bad
[1:26:14] <+Masked_Hero_Lucky> I hear the linkpearl noise and my mind immediately goes to "This is Thancred"
[1:26:17] <%Chichen> i think viera can actually use these
[1:26:23] <%croxeye> bnuy's need to be able to visually wear hats squenix pls
[1:26:31] <+emperri> drk possesses the unique ability to kill itself which is interesting for a tank
[1:26:31] <cartakus> Also DRK can heal himself or something?
[1:26:36] <%Chichen> yep lmao
[1:26:44] <%Chichen> i wish you could hide the mask
[1:26:47] <cartakus> *Can't
[1:26:52] <@SpaceCapnCrone> The FFXIV community is also very dramatic about jobs being 'bad', makes it seem a lot worse than it actually is
[1:26:58] <+Cuon_Alpinus> I love the mask
[1:27:00] <+RelikaNox> @Masked_Hero_Lucky I dunno why but I love how that's the first big meme of EW
[1:27:05] <+Masked_Hero_Lucky> I'd kill for a glamour version of it so I don't have to collect a bunch and take up a lot of room
[1:27:08] <LoreKeeper_Thal> @SpaceCapnCrone absolutely
[1:27:09] <%Visorak6> I have to admit I really like the 81 dungeon fending set, the helm's iffy though
[1:27:11] <+emperri> every tank can heal itself, drk is probably the least reliable at it
[1:27:16] <%Archmortal> you know, I never really pay much attention to MCH in dungeons, did FFXV steal the aoe poison from XIV or did XIV steal it from XV
[1:27:17] <%Chichen> @Cuon_Alpinus i like it, just wish the visor option hid it
[1:27:27] <sirtommygunn> All classes are viable but some are just better than others
[1:27:40] <PhilanthropyG> 3208 in Levi queue. Funny enough, going to lvl up MCH.
[1:27:45] <sirtommygunn> and by extension, some are just worse than others
[1:27:46] <+RelikaNox> @SpaceCapnCrone This hard, you woulda thought the sky was falling re: SCH but I haven't heard a peep since EW lol
[1:27:46] <%Baljhet> @Archmortal I think "the bioblaster" is from FFVI or something
[1:27:58] <%Archmortal> oh shit
[1:28:01] <%valriot> 3.X Paladin
[1:28:07] <%Visorak6> Every single person has argued with me for years trying to say monk is objectively bad.
[1:28:10] <+Masked_Hero_Lucky> Yeah, people being bored sitting around waiting for Chi just spamming "This is Thancred" in shout chat is funny
[1:28:13] <%Chichen> its just feel and how being disappointed in changes
[1:28:14] <%Monkeyweed21> Heavensward bow mage lol
[1:28:15] <KenzBurp> like, if you've got a good healer with you, drk can be great
[1:28:17] <%NopeBadguy> 5.0 nin was pretty bad
[1:28:17] <+emperri> when the difference in some extremes is percentages, "slightly worse" matters even if it's technically viable
[1:28:19] <DensityD> and yet some people have to buy clears
[1:28:20] <%LaughingCatt> there have different been times when classes are scuffed, but cant really say genuinely bad
[1:28:23] <%GIGA255> If you want a helmet on Viera, can't go wrong with the Heavy Iron Armor set.
[1:28:24] <%InternetShis> Every other Monk patch
[1:28:25] <%Baljhet> Monk was never bad, but it stopped being fun for a while
[1:28:25] <%Archmortal> 5.0 Warrior had it preeeeeetty rough even then though
[1:28:28] <Estwilde> "I didn't get new toys. My class is bad"
[1:28:31] <@CreepyPorpoise> its more likely to be a case of "this class doesn't feel good to play"
[1:28:33] <%Fenrirlives> wasn't Monk in a really bad spot for 5 . 0
[1:28:42] <Kain5707> SB WAR was fucking awful
[1:28:42] <@CreepyPorpoise> but there'll always be some freak who enjoys it
[1:28:43] <Demonkyo21> I just got to elpis and did a fate. THERE WAS SO MANY IXIONS
[1:28:46] <+deathscythe1287> @PatStaresAt God dammit I want the renaming server to allow me to rename my character
[1:28:46] <sirtommygunn> Monk was bad (if you can't be bothered to do their positional dance)
[1:28:48] <XyraFhoan> HW launch ast could barely do the Vault, that was pretty bad, but it was quickly adjusted
[1:28:52] <Kain5707> 4.0 WAR
[1:28:53] <%Monkeyweed21> ANATMAN AND SSS STILL SUCK
[1:28:53] <Demonkyo21> So much bulky neigh neighs...
[1:28:58] <%Chichen> and DRK just feels like a WAR Ripoff since shadowbringers
[1:28:58] <+RobertWayneLewis98> hello :)
[1:29:01] <%MrP33Ps> DRK damage is a fancy new toy
[1:29:04] <ape_hawk> hey pat and chat
[1:29:07] <%Guardiansaiyan> When I can finally play the game in february...I will start in Ul'Dah. Checked it out and it looks JUST LIKE the 1.0 starting scene city. @PatStaresAt
[1:29:08] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Oh thats why people mad at  the DRK Knight
[1:29:09] <+emperri> mnk is now bad and boring which is inventive
[1:29:11] <%brandonsbetow> I wouldn't know, I got in as a 3.X warr, bounced off super hard and came back at 5.3
[1:29:11] <%Baljhet> Monk also had no "big style" skill. It was just punches and occasionally you get a free off-cooldown.
[1:29:19] <%Guardiansaiyan> sup @ape_hawk
[1:29:21] <%LaughingCatt> but Pat we got damage, apparently that's good enough even though DRK plays like ass
[1:29:21] <+LevelUpSlick> bro idk how your going so ham with controller. so crazy how fast u are @PatStaresAt
[1:29:22] <Kain5707> highest
[1:29:23] <cartakus> He got the shadowbringer ooooooh
[1:29:26] <%Shikari21> not much higher than gnb
[1:29:30] <Estwilde> bigh
[1:29:36] <%valriot> best tank but who cares
[1:29:39] <%MrP33Ps> wrong
[1:29:40] <cartakus> Is it th3 best?
[1:29:43] <GilliamYaeger> About 100 dps higher than GNB
[1:29:44] <%Monkeyweed21> their opener is comparable to the weaker DPS
[1:29:50] <%croxeye> like what's the % dif?
[1:29:51] <sirtommygunn> The thing I dislike most about Monk is that their big moves are about making it so you can ignore their stance gimmick
[1:29:52] <Kain5707> DRK is the speedrun tank
[1:29:57] <sirtommygunn> Rather than building on what they do
[1:30:00] <%EsotericOdyssey> idk specifics but I've found DRK is still good for wall-to-wall
[1:30:11] <GilliamYaeger> Most DPS are at 6k, RPR is at 7k, all tanks are at around 4.5k
[1:30:12] <%GIGA255> I feel DRK should have a unique skill, like Sheltron, but the more damage you absorb, the more damage you put out when you release it.
[1:30:12] <+emperri> it ranks very poorly compared to ilvl creeping up crit patch by patch for WAR
[1:30:15] <%EsotericOdyssey> like vs other tanks
[1:30:17] <Keninrebo> DRK's opener hits hard, if not harder than some of the weakest dps atm
[1:30:17] <%MrP33Ps> it's about 100 dps over gnb. And of course it's lower than actual dps
[1:30:18] <+eaglesun> I tried playing this game. put like 60 hrs in and just cannot stand ARR. I am considering skipping to HW in the hopes it will get better, but are there less nonsense run back and forth quests in HW and forward?
[1:30:21] <cartakus> Try him pat
[1:30:24] <%MrP33Ps> but yeah, no heals on drk sucks
[1:30:27] <%tyler274> tyler274 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 43 months, currently on a 42 month streak! cleared the 83 ex last night. Was a blind prog party finder and we only queued in once. Kinda dissapointed it was so easy
[1:30:34] <+Melthius36> did you get the shotgun yet?
[1:30:45] <sirtommygunn> It gets less bad but it never goes away @eaglesun
[1:30:57] <%Chichen> @PatStaresAt DRK is a bit ahead of all the other tanks, but WAR and GNB are pretty much tied for 2nd highest tank Dps, and then PLD is a bit behind those 2.
[1:31:07] <%EsotericOdyssey> @Melthius36 what shotgun. for mch?
[1:31:20] <%MrP33Ps> yeah PLD damage is pretty bad
[1:31:30] <%MrP33Ps> well, relatively bad
[1:31:36] <+Melthius36> @Melthius36 yea, scatter shot i think
[1:31:37] <Blank9> the difference in tank dps is so small
[1:31:40] <+R_BChe> u think dungeon spamming is better than bozja for leveling healers
[1:31:52] <%Buttlo> These guys should have gotten their bombs from somewhere that wasn't the Bomberman universe.
[1:31:53] <%Chichen> i recently swapped to gamepad from M+K for several thousand hours and am shocked at how good gamepad feels
[1:31:59] <%tyler274> bozja with buffs > everthing else
[1:32:02] <%crimsonharvest> only if there's no queue
[1:32:03] <Blank9> bozja will almost always be faster outside of roulette
[1:32:04] <+donpepperoni> wait this dude is still alive
[1:32:07] <%legendfather_of_giants> @eaglesun there's a lot less, but some of the stuff in between the 2.x fetch quests is really important for later understanding
[1:32:08] <%tyler274> you do so much extra damage and are tanky af
[1:32:08] <%orbulon> just like most things once you get used to it controller/keyboard differences are neglible
[1:32:12] <%Archmortal> controller is fantastic, the real problem is the server ticks when your connection isn't fantastic
[1:32:15] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Do a Rider Kick
[1:32:15] <+Aeogard> >he doesn't know that pat has played on controller for years
[1:32:17] <%crimsonharvest> but your sanity will go down fast in bozja
[1:32:24] <DensityD> battle toads

[1:32:32] <%GIGA255> I wish the game tracked your in-air movement. No one else gets to see your sick air tricks.
[1:32:33] <+RelikaNox> Mad because small
[1:32:34] <DensityD> Pat is small
[1:32:35] <Ralfclogs> lala pat
[1:32:36] <Estwilde> pat is smol PrideLaugh
[1:32:41] <MonsieurHedge> MAD BECAUSE SMALL
[1:32:41] <sirtommygunn> I use gamepad now because my desk setup is fucked and I can't use m/keyboard without hurting my back, gamepad is very frustrating to use imo
[1:32:41] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Like real life
[1:32:42] <%UvBenServed> :)
[1:32:48] <AoiRob> what else is new
[1:32:48] <Ralfclogs> Mad because small
[1:32:53] <xDartuzax> DRK lacking survivability forces healer to lose dis, so its still a net loss
[1:32:59] <+RelikaNox> Jealous of tall
[1:33:07] <+emperri> smad
[1:33:08] <Kain5707> pat why are you not using speed song

[1:33:18] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[1:33:27] <%Chichen> once you get used to gamepad it becomes far less frustrating
[1:33:27] <Blank9> I like gamepad a lot more
[1:33:28] <%GIGA255> The crossbar is the only reason I decided to play this game.
[1:33:41] <+projectmanatees> Game pad is comfy
[1:33:42] <%TerpanderLux> idk lole
[1:33:43] <%Chichen> i always have M+K nearby so i can type or menu faster though
[1:33:45] <tanarath> Is Pat still Jealous of Tall?
[1:33:52] <+MoxaHaunt> Gamepad is in no way shape or form a handicap
[1:33:53] <%VioletHeart> I did the whole of ARR on a M+K and it was suffering.
[1:33:53] <+RelikaNox> Always
[1:33:53] <baked_potato11> is it too late to get started with his game?
[1:33:55] <Ralfclogs> The Clawwwwwww
[1:33:58] <sirtommygunn> Targeting specifically gets me heated sometimes
[1:33:59] <%Archmortal> @GIGA255 it's not the only reason for me, but it HELPED A LOT
[1:34:00] <%MalekDracarus> MalekDracarus subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 28 months! Thanks for all the tips. I’m having to do a lot of research on rotation and controller hotbar testing for BLM cause I’ve only played tank but I’m slowly getting there. Also 28 months woo.
[1:34:00] <%tyler274> i cant play on m/kb anymore because my hands hurt within minutes and gamepad is a godsend for this game
[1:34:01] <%VioletHeart> Controller feels much better.

[1:34:22] <%LaughingCatt> the answer is Yes, because you LITERALLY we not be able to get in
[1:34:23] <%Archmortal> you cannot buy new copies, nor make new free trial accounts
[1:34:25] <AoiRob> YOU CAN'T

[1:34:50] <sirtommygunn> Can't make new free trials
[1:34:52] <HibikiYamada> oh my god you can shoot them from there??? lmao
[1:34:53] <%croxeye> no new free trial accounts lol

[1:34:59] <%legendfather_of_giants> (temporarily)
[1:35:00] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Im fucking stuck in Heavensward even if I finish it : (
[1:35:01] <+RelikaNox> PLEASE UNHEAR OF THE CRITICALLY ACCLAIMED MMORPG FINAL FANTASY XIV
[1:35:02] <%EsotericOdyssey> COME BACK WHEN THEY HAVE NEW SERVERS
[1:35:09] <%GarbageNirvana> Soon as they get new servers in I bet
[1:35:11] <Demonkyo21> Yoshi P drowning in money like Scrooge MCduck
[1:35:12] <+projectmanatees> Ps5 controller needs to stay wired to get dual sense stuff right?
[1:35:14] <AoiRob> @cartakus no new accounts can be made. and existing trial account dont get to queue
[1:35:16] <+wizard_of_diamonds> The AOE is literally called Crane Game LUL
[1:35:16] <cartakus> Yay I just lost my diversion until ER
[1:35:16] <Estwilde> @baked_potato11 For real, though. Absolutely not. In a couple weeks it'll be leveling off again
[1:35:19] <%Fenrirlives> Glad I got in while I cou- THE QUEUE TIIIIIIME
[1:35:19] <Demonkyo21> "HELP! TOO....MUCH....MONEY."
[1:35:23] <%kyh9> No, you CANT play the free trial of the Critically Acclaimed MMO FFXIV Up to level 60 with no time limit.  And you CANT play the included Award winning expansion Heavensward either!
[1:35:34] <%orbulon> wired to computer?
[1:35:35] <Demonkyo21> @Fenrirlives I will bring the snacks
[1:35:40] <baked_potato11> @Estwilde i dont even know what that means
[1:35:43] <KenzBurp> unhear unfeel unthink
[1:35:47] <%NopeBadguy> I considered controller but nothing beats the feel of a mechanical keyboard for me
[1:35:55] <%0oki> haven't watched since the launch of EW. are you discussing spoilers? Haven't finished msq because of work and queues
[1:35:57] <%brandonsbetow> did you have to download any 3rd party drivers to get the ps5 controller working with pc?
[1:35:59] <%Fenrirlives> @demonkyo21 LUL
[1:36:02] <+SaphronBlackbourne> I was wondering whether to pick up a PS5 controller, I use a PS4 one right now
[1:36:07] <%NopeBadguy> HAVE YOU SEEN THE AXE FOR THIS DUNGEON
[1:36:08] <+Ganochan> IS THAT A FUCKING CHAINSAW?
[1:36:09] <+emperri> peloton btw
[1:36:09] <%NopeBadguy> IT'S A PIZZA CUTTER
[1:36:10] <%Chichen> @PatStaresAt i really hope they add adaptive trigger option for WXHB instead of double tapping
[1:36:13] <Demonkyo21> I'm in line too. SOMEONE BRING BOOZE
[1:36:17] <DensityD> skaven yes-yes
[1:36:18] <+RelikaNox> CHAINSAW SCYTHE??
[1:36:19] <AoiRob> CHAINSCYTHE
[1:36:20] <Estwilde> @baked_potato11 I mean that it's never too late to start. In a couple weeks the congestion will mostly have been leveled out as the folks hammering the story go back to playing other games
[1:36:24] <cartakus> Chain scythe?
[1:36:27] <%orbulon> is it worth switching to ps5 from xbox controller?
[1:36:29] <DensityD> pizza emote
[1:36:33] <%Fenrirlives> Lookit that absolute MILF
[1:36:34] <%barkon345> so I guess all that  Proselytizing paid off then
[1:36:36] <%Vyskus> @Chichen I didn't realize how badly I needed this until just now
[1:36:37] <%GIGA255> Disappointed we didn't get Dyeable dwarven gear this time. Hoping they don't pass over them this entire expansion.
[1:36:39] <+projectmanatees> Ah cool I’ll give it a go, Xbox controller is my go to buy be nice to try
[1:36:43] <%Ynkubus_> The Scaevan scythe is like weilding a Black & Decker gardening tool
[1:36:49] <sirtommygunn> I'm liking the trend of just adding chainsaws to everything
[1:36:51] <%Baljhet> anima isn't a woman in this game rooSuffer
[1:36:51] <Kain5707> Pat what magic are you leveling?
[1:36:52] <%brisk_dacat> Isn’t that a summon from ffx
[1:36:52] <baked_potato11> @Estwilde i only played wow way before, when it was good
[1:36:56] <%Vyskus> @Fenrirlives This ones a DILF tho
[1:37:04] <%Baljhet> @brisk_dacat yep
[1:37:07] <Estwilde> Oh I forgot to order grub hub
[1:37:08] <Estwilde> oh well
[1:37:11] <Estwilde> no pizza for me
[1:37:20] <%Fenrirlives> @vyskus WHAT octoGrab
[1:37:26] <+RelikaNox> Yo I got Brayflox in my leveling roulette earlier, was like "ugh I hate this place" and we were out in *less than ten minutes*
[1:37:30] <+RelikaNox> I was like wtf
[1:37:39] <%DamnFineCupofStreaming> DamnFineCupofStreaming subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 25 months! Man all this endwalker stuff is rad as hell, maybe when the game lets new people back in, I'll commit to actually starting
[1:37:50] <LoreKeeper_Thal> @RelikaNox behold the number crunch!
[1:37:52] <%Buttlo> I wish this boss was more significant but that's also because of how much I loved FFX when I first played it.
[1:37:58] <%Monkeyweed21> so is bottom Anima just Varis's penis?
[1:38:01] <ComfyFox> Anime Dimension AYAYA
[1:38:02] <%count_bob> @baked_potato11 They will let you buy the game in January again i think.
[1:38:03] <%GIGA255> Pat, don't forget to use Flamethrower at the end of this phase for the fun of it.
[1:38:05] <+RelikaNox> @RelikaNox IT WAS SO GOOD
[1:38:11] <%Vyskus> @Fenrirlives Ye, is daddy varis
[1:38:11] <sirtommygunn> I'm excited to reach Shadowbringers sometime next week
[1:38:13] <+emperri> this boss is so squandered in the second dungeon
[1:38:14] <GemeSvev> Looked away and thought Pat said Enema
[1:38:20] <Demonkyo21> I was playing earlier and I lose track of my day
[1:38:27] <Estwilde> @baked_potato11 Pat has described the game well on the podcast. FF14 is very much an RPG first, MMO second. If you enjoy an FF story, you will get that primarily, with multiplayer elements for boss fights and dungeons and some other stuff
[1:38:34] <KenzBurp> i want an anima EX
[1:38:39] <baked_potato11> i got it on steam from way before, but I was thinking it a second chance
[1:38:49] <%scynza> so if I buy a ps5 controller to use in 14, am I just going to have to have it always connected by usb?
[1:38:51] <%NopeBadguy> you cut off taht gnb's escape route
[1:38:53] <%NopeBadguy> LUL
[1:39:00] <Estwilde> @baked_potato11 now if you don't care for the story, you can still engage as little as you want and skip stuff if that's your choice, and want to focus on fun boss fights
[1:39:02] <%Fenrirlives> @vyskus bruh I'm in Shambles
[1:39:03] <EscoSul> testing if you can fall off eh
[1:39:17] <baked_potato11> @Estwilde is story good?
[1:39:30] <+RelikaNox> Story is A+++
[1:39:30] <+SaphronBlackbourne> Would you say it's worth it to upgrade from a PS4 controller to a PS5 one for PC games
[1:39:35] <%scynza> Does that require special setup, or just plug in and go (once you've selected ps5 controller in options that is)?
[1:39:36] <%Dakuu75> is Anima Shadowbringer or Endwalker?
[1:39:37] <Estwilde> @baked_potato11 you're kinda asking a biased audience here, but absolutely
[1:39:38] <LoreKeeper_Thal> story is GREAT
[1:39:43] <%0oki> any advantage to using ps5 controller vs ps4 controller?
[1:39:44] <+Kindan55> for some reason xiv reads my dualsense as a 360 controller
[1:39:46] <%GIGA255> story is the best FF story, hands down. blows the rest out of the water.
[1:39:46] <Kain5707> is story good? hoh boy thats a question
[1:39:49] <%Vyskus> @Fenrirlives I'm sorry I had to break the news to you like this
[1:39:50] <%Baljhet> @Dakuu75 Endwalker
[1:39:50] <baked_potato11> sorry, im total noob when it comes to this game :(
[1:39:51] <@JustinianKnight> I would recommend against skipping any story
[1:39:54] <Estwilde> @baked_potato11 I think the story through the whole game has made it my favorite Final Fantasy game story ever
[1:39:57] <sirtommygunn> @baked_potato11 Story is good once you get out of the initial game, A Realm Reborn, before that it's just ok
[1:39:58] <%Fenrirlives> @baked_potato11 Story is God Tier, especially during Heavensward
[1:40:13] <LoreKeeper_Thal> @baked_potato11 it's fine, we're here to answer what we can
[1:40:15] <%scynza> Thanks for the tips!
[1:40:15] <%Mekhet09> I wish I could play with ally moves showing but it makes the fight harder to see.
[1:40:36] <%TerpanderLux> whens msq roulette
[1:40:37] <%Dakuu75> @Baljhet thxs
[1:40:51] <baked_potato11> wow ,thanks alot, you guys are awesome <3
[1:40:52] <%RyTYoung> @baked_potato11 as someone who is slowly making his way through FF xiv I'd say the story is good, but there is a lot non voice acted cutscene's meaning there's a lot of reading involved, so patience is needed
[1:40:55] <+MoxaHaunt> Pat if you had to make a galaxy brain prediction what do you think will be a job next xpac?
[1:40:59] <Kain5707> lamne
[1:41:00] <%dwhanson> @baked_potato11 As someone who has had one of the WORST times trying to play this game between server errors and game crashes. This is one of my favourite stories ever.
[1:41:02] <%skeletonmilk> @PatStaresAt what's your favorite dungeon this expansion so far? I like Smileton.
[1:41:02] <%Dakuu75> lol
[1:41:06] <LoreKeeper_Thal> BOOOOOOOO CHAINSAW KATANA DENIED
[1:41:11] <+emperri> society
[1:41:11] <heartlesshealer> the only one
[1:41:14] <cartakus> RIP
[1:41:17] <%Baljhet> katanas tend to be pretty bland.
[1:41:19] <sirtommygunn> no chainsaw no deal
[1:41:23] <PhilanthropyG> Chaintana
[1:41:31] <%Fenrirlives> No Glorious Dohman Chainsaw Steel?
[1:41:32] <heartlesshealer> not even a serrated blade
[1:41:34] <%DamnFineCupofStreaming> this chainsaw was folded 1000 times
[1:41:37] <%JoshManVGH> Chainsaw Katana would be the best katana, it cuts while it cuts!
[1:41:47] <Estwilde> @baked_potato11 The biggest difference is that just about anything you do is not obsolete as you're playing through the game. More advanced players are always rewarded for queueing into things when you need to complete a story dungeon. Not like the traditional MMO stuff where base game content is completely forgotten and is hard to get done 'normally'
[1:41:55] <Kain5707> LUL
[1:41:57] <%JoshManVGH> @damnfinecupofstreaming LUL
[1:42:00] <%Baljhet> that seems like a bug?
[1:42:00] <%GIGA255> is that a bug I wonder?
[1:42:01] <%TerpanderLux> laaaame
[1:42:09] <sirtommygunn> What is the most absurd weapon to put a chainsaw on
[1:42:09] <%JoshManVGH> Then it's serrated!
[1:42:12] <+SeventhVice> the moving saws are in the omikron shop
[1:42:13] <%Fenrirlives> bruh they couldn't even give us a serrated Katana like Power rangers Samurai?
[1:42:14] <sirtommygunn> a Flail?
[1:42:16] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt CRP 90 crafted is JUST a chainsaw
[1:42:17] <PerfectAsymmetry> @PatStaresAt How do you deal with inventory space mind goblins? I tend to burn myself out grinding specific job types so I can throw away lower-level equipment
[1:42:18] <Estwilde> If you end up checking it out, just play at your own pace @baked_potato11 There's no rush to the end
[1:42:21] <%TerpanderLux> :)
[1:42:21] <cartakus> That's so COOL
[1:42:22] <%Ynkubus_> Hingashi's probably got a bunch of chain katanas away from all the adventurers
[1:42:24] <Kain5707> Pat have you touched any of the extremes yet?
[1:42:26] <%JoshManVGH> That's just a handsaw, you bastards!
[1:42:26] <%Baljhet> @sirtommygunn one of the books (SCH or SMN)
[1:42:28] <%tyler274> ive been getting the final boss every trial roulette for like a week
[1:42:28] <%Guardiansaiyan> We watched your whole endwalker stream...we will be okay @PatStaresAt
[1:42:28] <%GarbageNirvana> If you're playing RPR the lv82 scythe is a chainsaw scythe
[1:42:29] <%TerpanderLux> im aware
[1:42:30] <%NopeBadguy> oops all spoilers
[1:42:31] <PhilanthropyG> be ready to dive out of twitch at the first sound of new thing
[1:42:36] <%Mekhet09> @PatStaresAt Have you done any of the exs? I cleared both but I can't get a goddamn weapon for the life of me.
[1:42:39] <Kain5707> 2nd extreme is really fun
[1:42:41] <%GarbageNirvana> It's basically the Scaevan Magitek scythe
[1:42:41] <+Ed_The_Crimson> To be fair to the gunblade it just has "Saw" in the name. Not chainsaw.
[1:42:42] <baked_potato11> @Estwilde will do, thanks, i'm gonna give it a go <3
[1:42:45] <@CreepyPorpoise> halfway through january
[1:42:48] <%Fenrirlives> @patstaresat spoil me brother
[1:42:48] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Spoil us big daddy pat
[1:42:48] <Kain5707> but that dps check is tight
[1:42:49] <@CreepyPorpoise> creepy49Cry
[1:42:50] <%RyTYoung> I'm watching half heartedly so I don't get spoiled, as long as it's nothing crazy story related I'm good
[1:42:52] <heartlesshealer> casual play is casual spoiler, be careful viewers
[1:42:57] <+SaphronBlackbourne> I did one of them last night, didn't clear but I got close
[1:43:02] <%GarbageNirvana> EXs haven't been as hard I don't feel
[1:43:09] <+kickaxe88> Will you ever make a video about your controller set up for this game?
[1:43:10] <PhilanthropyG> Did Nidhogg EX solo yesterday as a 90 PLD. Was fun shit
[1:43:19] <LoreKeeper_Thal> yes
[1:43:20] <%TerpanderLux> oh no
[1:43:21] <%tyler274> the 83 trial is much easier than even the normal mode 89
[1:43:22] <Kain5707> it has a tight dps check
[1:43:22] <%VioletHeart> Nah the first one is easy.
[1:43:23] <%Divryne> All EXs are easy.
[1:43:23] <%NopeBadguy> they're both really easy
[1:43:23] <%valriot> Wrong way round, the first one is
[1:43:26] <%tyler274> *83 ex
[1:43:27] <Estwilde> the first one took me about an hour hehe
[1:43:27] <%VioletHeart> Second one is harder.
[1:43:28] <LoreKeeper_Thal> first one is a bit quirkier
[1:43:28] <%brandonsbetow> I agree
[1:43:28] <%scynza> Really? I heard that the second was harder than the first
[1:43:29] <%TerpanderLux> im some people
[1:43:31] <%Jamejarrs> Personally the first one is way easier
[1:43:31] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Big Daddy War-Pat
[1:43:32] <KenzBurp> the first round of ex is supposed to be easier
[1:43:42] <%Mekhet09> You have a static. I don't so if you don't clear in the first weak or else you get all the people who just can't play.
[1:43:46] <Estwilde> on extreme, not sure on that
[1:43:49] <PhilanthropyG> I WAS THERE with you when pizza slices were a thing
[1:43:51] <%CalderGaming> elitist in chat lol
[1:43:51] <%shurtal> WAHOO PIZZA TIME
[1:43:53] <PhilanthropyG> youd go apeshit in the FC
[1:43:54] <%Mekhet09> wee;
[1:43:55] <@CreepyPorpoise> been in the queue for like an hour and a half
[1:43:59] <%Visorak6> Sophia EX was also real rough on release
[1:44:00] <Ciglossonjr> I shouldn't be here if I haven;'t beaten Endwalker should I
[1:44:01] <@CreepyPorpoise> and I still have 900 people ahead of me
[1:44:09] <@CreepyPorpoise> u_u
[1:44:11] <%TerpanderLux> porpoce
[1:44:11] <%tyler274> the 89 ex at least has mechs that you cant just hug a safety dorito for
[1:44:12] <heartlesshealer> @PatStaresAt which classes have the most view-obscuring effects for their skills?
[1:44:13] <Demonkyo21> When can we make the hummingways?
[1:44:15] <%JoshManVGH> Ooof
[1:44:20] <%RealThiele> porp locked out 5eva
[1:44:20] <%Mekhet09> @CalderGaming Dude I don't care about parsing but the later you do it the harder it is.

[1:47:23] <%Alazull> Boo
[1:47:25] <mike0dude> i saw pat standing behind me in the quest and looked at the stream to see i was removed from his friendlist Feelsbadman
[1:47:27] <sirtommygunn> It's an investment in my drug dealing business
[1:47:27] <PhilanthropyG> that or a super expensive pet project.
[1:47:28] <%Mekhet09> Only the first one is free.
[1:47:28] <cartakus> Yay

[1:48:47] <%InternetShis> The foot AOE
[1:48:48] <%Shikari21> if every dps just dps the boss this fight is so fast
[1:48:59] <%RealThiele> stat squish in general has been great for early content you do way more damage than before
[1:49:05] <heartlesshealer> at least it's named Bertha

[1:49:20] <XyraFhoan> it feels like they buffed the dragonkiller at least
[1:49:22] <cartakus> OOF
[1:49:26] <AoiRob> nice dodge
[1:49:31] <Kain5707> use the dragonator
[1:49:39] <BreakfastSampler> LUL
[1:49:39] <@SpaceCapnCrone> no need to accept raises in this fight, you can just release and run back in
[1:49:40] <sirtommygunn> Just shoot him a lot then
[1:49:49] <XxMoliciousxX> I think you only use those on adds
[1:50:04] <Ciglossonjr> Do we ever see a non-first brood dragon as big as Vishap again?
[1:50:07] <%RealThiele> nah cannons hurt boss, but sap is for adds
[1:50:13] <%Fenrirlives> Is this Square trying to put Monster Hunter in again?
[1:50:25] <%legendfather_of_giants> what it doesn't come up on our roulettes once a week? @PatStaresAt
[1:50:27] <Kain5707> go up the tower
[1:50:28] <%Mekhet09> This is an old fight.
[1:50:33] <DensityD> hello safi'jiiva
[1:50:39] <ToneBacas> genetics
[1:50:39] <+Kindan55> this trial really should have been a solo instance
[1:50:40] <@SpaceCapnCrone> this fight was a real experience back when it was new/pre-nerf
[1:50:41] <XxMoliciousxX> where in the MSQ is Pat at?
[1:50:42] <whispersilk001> This boss is so weird, you can basically ignore all the mechanics now due to DPS optimization.
[1:50:43] <+the22cstomp> he ate his veggies
[1:50:44] <%TerpanderLux> and the siege fight here is just as shitty as the siege fights in monster hunter
[1:50:45] <PhilanthropyG> growth spurt
[1:50:45] <%orbulon> the big genes come from his mother
[1:50:46] <LoreKeeper_Thal> he drank a lot of juice!
[1:50:50] <%CzeekyTV> isn't middy's actual body/size wrapped around the Agrius?
[1:50:52] <sirtommygunn> His mom was even bigger
[1:50:54] <+Kindan55> he's a certain type of dragon. there's lore for it
[1:50:54] <%legendfather_of_giants> @XxMoliciousxX done
[1:50:56] <+Chewygamer> This boss has really nice feet
[1:50:56] <%RealThiele> he put all his points in con
[1:50:56] <AdmiralButtloaf> he was bread to be a siege weapon
[1:51:01] <%InternetShis> You should see my stepdad next to his mom
[1:51:03] <%TerpanderLux> kill
[1:51:03] <@CreepyPorpoise> @CzeekyTV yeah
[1:51:05] <%DianaTheAscian> I forgot this is in the game
[1:51:06] <%ShogunNoonto> he aet all his grwwns
[1:51:08] <SaltyGuyMan> He's the Andre the Giant of dragons
[1:51:09] <+hush_wolf> have you tried Gun?
[1:51:10] <+wizard_of_diamonds> I thought the big tower canons were important
[1:51:11] <%Divryne> Holy shit got both my EX mounts I'm done with this game until Savage now. LUL
[1:51:12] <PhilanthropyG> the RE initiative; shoot him until hes dead.
[1:51:12] <+Masked_Hero_Lucky> He's probably just meant to be a living siege weapon. He's got size but no smarts
[1:51:17] <%Ynkubus_> Not as big as his grandad tho
[1:51:20] <+wizard_of_diamonds> And the binding
[1:51:20] <@SpaceCapnCrone> His dad probably said "Son, I want you to grow up into a siege weapon."
[1:51:22] <Zombrocom> Oh hey. It's lao shan lung. What's he doin here?
[1:51:25] <%Divryne> Guess I'm lucky.
[1:51:26] <sirtommygunn> Biggest problem with this fight is the music imo
[1:51:26] <LoreKeeper_Thal> @Divryne GAMING
[1:51:28] <%CzeekyTV> @CzeekyTV that seems a heck of a lot bigger than this
[1:51:29] <%InternetShis> My stepgrandma is 4'8", my stepdad is 6'2"
[1:51:33] <cartakus> His dad is snake dragon?
[1:51:34] <%Mekhet09> probably luck lol.
[1:51:37] <%RocketBarrel> Stupid amounts of luck
[1:51:47] <%tyler274> @Divryne those who walked before may guide those who walk after
[1:51:49] <Daniel_Is_I> They got tiny heaDS

[1:59:18] <%NitronStreams> hey kids you wanna see a dead body?
[1:59:20] <%Chichen> @scynza plug it in, go to character settings, hit the controller button top left. If you want full Dualsense settings gotta be wired and if you're on steam you gotta turn off steam controller support for the game.
[1:59:22] <animaturgy> Gridania racists

[2:35:54] <AdmiralButtloaf> the quests give hi cordials
[2:35:55] <@QueequegTheater> Wait why would you make macros for crafting and gathering?
[2:35:59] <@QueequegTheater> Just hit buttons
[2:36:06] <%CzeekyTV> i don't think you macro gathering collectibles, you just play it by ear
[2:36:18] <%Visorak6> because when you have to make 99 HQ precrafts it gets tedious
[2:36:20] <%DianaTheAscian> I wanna hit 1 button
[2:36:20] <%Felhad> 2926 in queue NotLikeThis

[2:48:46] <%walternatorz> Do you think the fascist fruit caused the garleans to be so fascist?
[2:48:46] <%NopeBadguy> "it's time to study fascism"
[2:48:48] <%furiousfurioso> oh it goes

[2:49:43] <MKII> they're gonna break into bollywood dance after dinner

[2:50:18] <Daniel_Is_I> 'CAUSE GARLEANS LIKE GUNS
[2:50:19] <%rekinom> "Sometimes it's fun to dress up like a nazi"
[2:50:19] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Feel the fascism flow through you
[2:50:23] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> i dont know abuut this comdra

[2:50:57] <Zukozai> See Pat it's Hugo Boss's fault the Nazi's were evil
[2:51:04] <Zukozai> The fashion gives evil power
[2:51:05] <+polothegreatest> Prof. Scarr
[2:51:14] <%hoodedlefty> rubrSweat her thirst is real
[2:51:33] <+Melthius36> must be one those vegetable oil engines
[2:51:35] <%Felhad> These quests are so horny
[2:51:40] <%tetraes> Damn why do fascists gotta have cool uniforms why cant they just look like total losers
[2:51:43] <%InternetShis> But did they use Ala Mhigan mummies to make the ceruleum?
[2:51:47] <+SuperMightyGPlays> she's putting out runway lights and he's not understanding
[2:51:49] <%RealThiele> hahaha
[2:51:53] <%RealThiele> imagine doing that
[2:51:55] <dinnydanny777> limesShy
[2:52:00] <FelixAyada> she'd love to Sample his Dish
[2:52:04] <%rekinom> She wants some of that lizzer dick
[2:52:06] <%TerpanderLux> sample his dick B)
[2:52:14] <%rekinom> Reaches its CLIMAX*
[2:52:19] <%Dianaillumani> She him to conclude all over he doesn't she
[2:52:20] <+Tonemanzero> The thirst in this questline
[2:52:20] <%GarbageNirvana> He needs an air traffic controller, he's literally flying clueless in a holding pattern
[2:52:32] <tanarath> Has Garlian use of Cerulium begun to fuck with the ley lines at all?
[2:52:34] <+wmeldrum> reaches its COMPLETION
[2:52:46] <%hoodedlefty> research complete, she is now pregonate
[2:52:57] <Daniel_Is_I> Yeup
[2:52:57] <%Mekhet09> @tanarath It's more like gass.
[2:53:00] <FelixAyada> yeah it's super easy to do with collectables
[2:53:04] <%Mekhet09> They mine it.
[2:53:10] <%BinaryFireball> doesnt that kinda defeat the point though?
[2:53:11] <%JoshManVGH> Is it flattened for lower levels too?
[2:53:11] <lil_scooby_snack> I got 90 in a few hours
[2:53:12] <Daniel_Is_I> Same with one or two crafters.
[2:53:15] <%Aeoneth> Yeah it didn't take long for me
[2:53:17] <%InternetShis> Just spam aaaaall your leves
[2:53:23] <+ZipperHands> Doing that and Levequests can have you reach 90 is only a few hours
[2:53:25] <%BinaryFireball> like I would think leveling gathering is its own content kinda
[2:53:27] <tanarath> I know, I'm asking if climate change is a thing.
[2:53:27] <XxMoliciousxX> oh I was just mining ores like a pleb, made good gil though
[2:53:28] <%rekinom> leves are for crafters
[2:53:37] <%Mekhet09> Super easy.
[2:53:41] <%Mekhet09> If you do the right ones.
[2:53:42] <Daniel_Is_I> Craft 50 collectables and you're at like 88-90.
[2:53:44] <%Aeoneth> I've been getting a crafter level every 4-5 leves
[2:53:45] <%afronooch> Dumb easy
[2:53:47] <%Dianaillumani> leves are still pretty good
[2:53:56] <%rekinom> I did all my crafters in about 6 hours
[2:53:56] <%RealThiele> leves can max out 3 classes before they run out
[2:53:59] <%walternatorz> crafting is made easier if you're willing to spend bicolor stones
[2:54:23] <%walternatorz> I found myself having to rely on a lot of leather mats
[2:54:25] <%Mekhet09> Or just buy the items. TBH.
[2:54:28] <%Mekhet09> Markets taned.
[2:54:36] <%Mekhet09> tanked for like gaja hides.
[2:54:37] <%rekinom> You can do around 5 jobs to cap with a mix of leves and role quests
[2:54:43] <%tyler274> back to bollybood bop
[2:54:51] <dinnydanny777> limesDance
[2:55:11] <Zukozai> Wow this music is a BOP post MSQ
[2:55:14] <%TerpanderLux> limesDance
[2:55:19] <%doc_ock_rokc> Hey pat are you gonna do the new war in warframe. The mission is pretty good
[2:55:27] <%legendfather_of_giants> moon
[2:55:29] <XxMoliciousxX> moon ore?
[2:55:31] <%InternetShis> I made 3 million in the first week on bicolour gemstone purchases and sells on the MB, and yeah that market is now a buyer's market
[2:55:37] <%Kindan55> I really love hanging out in Radz post game
[2:55:42] <%InternetShis> Moon iirc
[2:55:46] <%Dianaillumani> Elden Rung
[2:55:56] <+Mrbaconator> disc room
[2:56:05] <%InternetShis> Right inside the big crater in front of the building
[2:56:32] <%rekinom> You can just open the gathering log in game and it'll show you on the map @PatStaresAt
[2:56:48] <robust_egg> :o
[2:56:54] <XxMoliciousxX> what botany stuff is on the moon?
[2:56:58] <%Aeoneth> is anyone else hearing the linkpearl ring?
[2:57:01] <%rekinom> click it
[2:57:05] <%TerpanderLux> The Pipe
[2:57:09] <%afronooch> press x on it
[2:57:13] <%teebos> click it
[2:57:14] <%brandonsbetow> garland tools is still superior
[2:57:15] <%rekinom> Click on it and it opens the map and shows it
[2:57:16] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt hit A again and it gives you it on the map
[2:57:17] <%rekinom> press x
[2:57:30] <Daniel_Is_I> Hell yeah, it's a good questline
[2:57:34] <%InternetShis> The Linkpearl noise is the Garland Tools 2 minute warning that a timed gathering node is gonna pop
[2:57:58] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> fuck yeah im gathering too\
[2:58:05] <%cvp5127> cvp5127 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 31 months! pat which is easier  for a new player to learn machinist or bard?
[2:58:38] <%Puhff> @cvp5127 machinist, bard is a lot of micro-managing
[2:58:49] <Zukozai> My brain cannot compute the 83 trial mechanics
[2:58:55] <+Mrbaconator> hippity hoppity get off my property
[2:58:56] <Zukozai> Like I just stop working completely
[2:58:58] <%InternetShis> Starshower is just Mario Party
[2:59:04] <%RealThiele> bunny on the brain
[2:59:09] <%Nekros4442> @Zukozai picture it like a bookpage turning over
[2:59:11] <%doc_ock_rokc> I thought you said you don't like vibration pat?
[2:59:15] <Daniel_Is_I> Does the sabotender have good vibration?
[2:59:24] <%BinaryFireball> is it a flying tank?
[2:59:30] <%TerpanderLux> love that mount
[2:59:39] <Ciglossonjr> Whether or not everyone in your party understands starshower is the difference between Hell and not Hell
[2:59:44] <imthewisejanitor> F R O G G O
[2:59:45] <Ciglossonjr> Even on regular
[2:59:50] <%TerpanderLux> oh god i need that mount
[2:59:51] <Ciglossonjr> Actually, especially on regular
[2:59:52] <$laurenzthezero> how do you set up the haptic in steam?
[2:59:53] <%croxeye> its a froggo
[3:00:05] <%tyler274> @Ciglossonjr even then you follow a safety dorito
[3:00:22] <Ciglossonjr> Dude
[3:00:33] <RadShiro> i havent crafted collectables yet. maybe i should
[3:00:33] <Zukozai> Garlemalding
[3:00:36] <%Kindan55> @laurenzthezero Disable its controller support int he game's properties
[3:00:38] <Ciglossonjr> The safety dorito literally saved my first run through
[3:01:01] <KenzBurp> @Ciglossonjr i know its got something to do with the colored dots on the floor...right?
[3:01:04] <%TerpanderLux> jermaPluto
[3:01:05] <Ciglossonjr> If it was not for the saftey dorito, we would have had more than our ~4 wipes
[3:01:13] <+RelikaNox> LUL
[3:01:14] <%TerpanderLux> is that chris' blood?
[3:01:17] <%rekinom> @RadShiro collectables are a great alternative when you run out of leves, and for CUL and ALC you can level 84 - 90 with just collectables
[3:01:25] <%Chamapa_Stys> cute froggo
[3:01:44] <+orochiblood> Garlemald is such a depressing zone
[3:01:50] <tubit> yo
[3:01:50] <%TerpanderLux> hi
[3:01:56] <%Visorak6> I'm digesting WAR buttons
[3:01:57] <%SveriSageAdvice> nothing much, just got Sage to 90!
[3:02:00] <TheSpoonyBard27> I love calling the marker a safety dorito
[3:02:01] <%InternetShis> Fishing
[3:02:02] <DirigibleDPlomo> “you guys should clean this up” points to a pile of bodies
[3:02:05] <%doc_ock_rokc> I accidently gave myself food poisioning
[3:02:06] <RadShiro> @RadShiro oooooh that should be helpful
[3:02:07] <@CreepyPorpoise> its fog, pat
[3:02:09] <%NopeBadguy> garlemald was probably more depressing when it wasn't burnt to the ground
[3:02:11] <Srthunda> fog pat
[3:02:11] <LoreKeeper_Thal> it's gone
[3:02:16] <LivvieLesbian> BABIL GONE?
[3:02:17] <+l3sovikk> Tore it down
[3:02:19] <@SpaceCapnCrone> come to garlemald, see the tube
[3:02:23] <%TerpanderLux> you killed the evil
[3:02:31] <%Visorak6> I'm so salty that I've discovered holmgang is literally living dead but better in all respects atm
[3:02:34] <floatRand> It's just foggy
[3:02:37] <floatRand> Just entering Silent Hill phase.
[3:02:38] <+SuperMightyGPlays> fog blocking it
[3:02:40] <%InternetShis> I need 36 lake urchins for a 6x-turn-in L fishing leve
[3:02:44] <RadShiro> did they already fix it???
[3:02:49] <%shurtal> I love it when people refuse to do mechanics in the second boss fight in Dohn Meg.  yay
[3:02:58] <@SpaceCapnCrone> they just turned on the fog machine
[3:03:07] <Ciglossonjr> I really love the just purely stark contrast between the entire game going “we’re going to have the big battles in garlemald for freedom and it’ll be awesome” and endwalker hitting you with some of the more dire fucking shit I have ever seen
[3:03:14] <%Alazull> Yeah it's almost impossible to use controller for me
[3:03:14] <Ahack13> Started leveling summoner. Been playing blackmage since I started n HW. Think
[3:03:18] <Daniel_Is_I> I tried playing on controller and I felt like my brain was broken.
[3:03:19] <Zukozai> I go back and forth every few months between keyboard and controller
[3:03:19] <%TerpanderLux> haha
[3:03:23] <Ahack13> Think I might switch mains
[3:03:32] <RadShiro> i would most likely not be playinf FF14 if it wasnt for controller support
[3:03:32] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[3:03:35] <+bigslinglelino> I tried to play on controller one time and it felt like the game was in a different language lol
[3:03:36] <%Alazull> Also Pat can you turn down the volume on your alarms? They are hella loud
[3:03:51] <+polothegreatest> Yup
[3:03:57] <+cascadepersona> Where do people get strats for EX? I keep seeing people post DPS Stay, Tanks mid, etc. for Party Finder, but I don't where they get it from?
[3:04:03] <%ChocolateMoofin> Howdy, Pat!
[3:04:05] <%InternetShis> Garland Tools is the new Discord notification scare
[3:04:07] <%Alazull> Thank you
[3:04:18] <+SuperMightyGPlays> @cascadepersona youtube guides
[3:04:40] <%BinaryFireball> its easy if you start off with being platform independent and harder each year you dont
[3:04:42] <%RealThiele> game is ancient
[3:04:51] <%JonathLP> Flashing back to last Tuesday at work
[3:04:52] <+RelikaNox> Yeah it's not like AWS ever goes down and takes a MMORPG out with it..... >_>
[3:04:53] <%ChocolateMoofin> They wanna ASSUME DIRECT CONTROL
[3:04:55] <%Agami23> an entire server had their characters deleted in new world last i checked
[3:04:58] <+wmeldrum> lol us-east-1 just went down last week
[3:05:03] <%Nekros4442> Not to mention it seems like a conflict of interest to let FF14 servers be controlled by Amazon of all companies
[3:05:04] <shadowstreakXIII> You don't want to have GW2 AWS problems...
[3:05:13] <Vexedpanda> Have you spent the 15 minutes to get the level checker mount yet?
[3:05:13] <MKII> when I looked up a guide the first one I found fit the party finder strats but you could always ask the group
[3:05:29] <+orochiblood> new world did the aws cloud thing and look what happened there
[3:05:39] <%BinaryFireball> kubenetes bb
[3:05:40] <+polothegreatest> blame cryptos LUL PJSalt
[3:05:51] <+cascadepersona> @supermightygplays Is there a specific youtuber they follow? I don't want to join a party and mess up others.
[3:06:00] <RadShiro> @PatStaresAt i just put on vibration for my PS5 controller and this shit is weeeeird
[3:06:01] <floatRand> It's 8% so yeah
[3:06:18] <Manwad> Moon flowers? pog
[3:06:24] <Zukozai> Ah yes renowned greenhouse, the moon
[3:06:26] <LoreKeeper_Thal> MOOOOOOOOON
[3:06:28] <%strakillias> Why the fuck would there be plants on the moon
[3:06:32] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt i cant use vibration because I play wireless
[3:06:38] <%Agami23> i'd love to see how the vibration works with dancer. because its all procs
[3:06:49] <%solracc25> With the bunny people
[3:07:00] <+SuperMightyGPlays> @cascadepersona probably just go to yt and search for ex guide. there's usually many for each one
[3:07:02] <cimturry> watching endwalker shananagans made me try 14 and now im freaking out cus i love it but i know a bunch of cool stuff that i shouldnt ;_;
[3:07:02] <XyraFhoan> the vibration is super great for fishing since different fish sizes have different rumble strengths
[3:07:06] <Daniel_Is_I> How do collectables work with multiple instances?
[3:07:08] <%legendfather_of_giants> at least it's not Destiny 2, where you cant use your controller if youre not wired
[3:07:09] <%TerpanderLux> limesDance
[3:07:14] <Daniel_Is_I> Do you still only get one go?
[3:07:17] <@SpaceCapnCrone> only thing I'll say is it makes the queue pop/drop/pop/drop extra infuriating
[3:07:25] <LivvieLesbian> Damn that is a savage mount
[3:07:30] <%TerpanderLux> dude....
[3:07:31] <%Agami23> hey pat, why is a moon rock tastier than a earth rock?
[3:07:34] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt yoiu only get one
[3:07:37] <RadShiro> @XyraFhoan WHAT. well now I gotta go fish
[3:07:40] <%TerpanderLux> if its instance based....
[3:07:42] <%TerpanderLux> damn
[3:07:44] <%Agami23> because its a little meteor
[3:07:47] <RetributionP> Pat, what do I do? I stayed up like 20 hours yesterday but for some reason my body slept for like 3 hours.
[3:07:55] <%rekinom> Gathering nodes are "quest" in game that reset at the appropriate eorzean time, no instance hopping allowed
[3:08:08] <+cascadepersona> @supermightygplays Alright then, thank yoy
[3:08:08] <+l3sovikk> The dragons died so you could have that mount >:(
[3:08:08] <fistynopunches> robo gigantoad
[3:08:09] <+SuperMightyGPlays> the instances are actually a pain in the ass for hunts even if you get more kills
[3:08:14] <%strakillias> Why is it so spiderlike but not a spider
[3:08:23] <%MooseIsGoose> Moon stuff
[3:08:24] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Like the moon bunny named Threeway
[3:08:28] <%cvp5127> ponder moon
[3:08:46] <floatRand> It spins
[3:08:46] <%TerpanderLux> ye its cool
[3:08:49] <Daniel_Is_I> It slowly rotates
[3:08:53] <floatRand> So you can see Meracydia and New World.
[3:08:55] <%tyler274> meracydia is bigger than eorzea
[3:08:56] <XxMoliciousxX> yeah it rotates
[3:08:58] <%CalderGaming> @strakillias combat optimization. this is the easy answer for everything about omega
[3:09:03] <Daniel_Is_I> People ripped the entire texture and you can see the new world and meracydia
[3:09:09] <@SpaceCapnCrone> someone unraveled the planet texture and we got to see the world map
[3:09:14] <%walternatorz> that's not to say BRD is hard to learn
[3:09:15] <%RealThiele> bard is nuts to learn
[3:09:21] <%CzeekyTV> BRD DOTs don't proc anymore, the song does it itself :(
[3:09:25] <floatRand> Meracydia is basically Australia it seems. No wonder it'll be lv99 expansion zone.
[3:09:30] <Daniel_Is_I> That's Meracydia right there I think
[3:09:52] <%Dianaillumani> Do you think there gonna go to 10 or do 99
[3:09:55] <%Arsenic_8> i hope we get a flat earth questline
[3:09:56] <%Dianaillumani> 100*
[3:09:56] <+wizard_of_diamonds> THE PUPPY PogChamp
[3:09:59] <+wizard_of_diamonds> He is so cute
[3:10:00] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt did you see square enix put a "please play something else" sale on steam
[3:10:03] <Ciglossonjr> The clouds not going away really disappointed me to be honest
[3:10:04] <%TerpanderLux> moon2BED comfy
[3:10:08] <%Agami23> meracydia seems real interesting to me. because thats where the waring triad was from
[3:10:11] <Daniel_Is_I> Just stare at the ORB
[3:10:19] <Daniel_Is_I> Nah it's just a Square Enix Sale
[3:10:22] <+polothegreatest> FF really like cloud, huh LUL
[3:10:25] <%NopeBadguy> it's not but it is
[3:10:26] <LoreKeeper_Thal> what if we go from level 80 to level 1 on the next expansion
[3:10:29] <Zukozai> I wish the pixel remasters would go on sale
[3:10:37] <RadShiro> that would be the most amazing sale name ever
[3:10:37] <%solracc25> Ponder the large orb
[3:10:39] <%TerpanderLux> yo that shark owns
[3:10:48] <Daniel_Is_I> Ocean fishing in 53 minutes. Easy 2.5 levels of xp.
[3:10:49] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> cant wait to go to new world (amaricas)
[3:10:49] <+Melthius36> i can see my house from here
[3:10:52] <%Felhad> i have that shark from ocean fishing!
[3:11:37] <%TerpanderLux> nice B)
[3:11:37] <floatRand> You can also use Solid Reason
[3:11:43] <%CzeekyTV> nice rock bro
[3:11:50] <%legendfather_of_giants> an adult game came out on Steam yesterday and hit #4 global top selling this morning
[3:11:53] <Daniel_Is_I> It's the +1 integrity
[3:12:07] <%ChocolateMoofin> What about flexible reason?
[3:12:09] <Daniel_Is_I> It's not really worth it below 90
[3:12:11] <RadShiro> yeah Solid Reason is actually good now
[3:12:26] <floatRand> At 90 it has 50% chance to grant a proc that gives free integrity too.
[3:12:28] <Daniel_Is_I> At 90 it gives you a 50% chance of getting +2 instead of +1
[3:12:29] <TheSpoonyBard27> Its better at 90
[3:12:34] <+Tonemanzero> Solid reason is always nice with collectables
[3:12:58] <%ChocolateMoofin> Has the servers and stuff gotten better?
[3:13:22] <%legendfather_of_giants> oh man Balan Wonderworld is 50% off for the sale
[3:13:38] <Daniel_Is_I> I haven't found much use for collector's focus but if you have 100gp to spare then why not
[3:13:46] <%legendfather_of_giants> quiet man is 80% off
[3:13:52] <%tyler274> its cpu bound yea
[3:13:57] <LoreKeeper_Thal> too much people
[3:13:57] <%MooseIsGoose> speaking of square enix I picked up Guardians of the Galaxy and it was worth it for $40 I have already beat it
[3:14:01] <%doc_ock_rokc> watch your Radz level!
[3:14:13] <%Felhad> maybe Radz doesn't like your framerate

[3:23:47] <%doubleslapmeharderwhitney> Howdy ya’ll! I’ve taken the opportunity to get back into FFXIV now that Endwalker’s out. Been off and on for a few years, but I’m almost out of ARR finally! Friends are going through Endwalker while I’m delivering shirts for the Eorzean U.N. or whatever. I’ll get there someday…
[3:23:49] <%CalderGaming> hollytonesDance
[3:23:57] <%Felhad> I can't believe Endwalker broke the most basic rule of The Adventure Zone: Balance
[3:24:07] <%Felhad> No dogs on the moon.
[3:24:26] <%Monkeyweed21> @doubleslapmeharderwhitney the soldiers REALLY need that soup bro
[3:24:40] <%eremital> @Felhad omfg

[3:26:38] <+Tonemanzero> Sounds like the moon doesn't need anymore brand deals
[3:26:57] <%Felhad> @doubleslapmeharderwhitney Jokes on them, you still have the critically acclaimed expansion Heavensward to enjoy for the first time
[3:26:59] <%Monkeyweed21> I cant wait for 9.2 when the main story conflict is that Urianger starts dating a chick with kids and the kids keep making fun of the way he talks and call him cringe
[3:27:14] <MidnightSnack69> tasty moon rocks

[3:29:39] <%InternetShis> Still fishin

[3:29:54] <Ciglossonjr> I’m at walmart
[3:29:58] <%doubleslapmeharderwhitney> @felhad Not if Yoko Taro burns down the servers like I paid him to
[3:30:05] <pixeldust48> that shiny is really easy to get actually
[3:30:24] <%Complete_Phased> doesnt raid come out on Tuesday?
[3:30:30] <MKII> yeah that's gonna nice
[3:30:37] <LoreKeeper_Thal> the fact that the 2002 shit is 1.0 code is hilarious
[3:30:39] <%Felhad> lol, Taro already tried to delete our characters
[3:30:51] <LoreKeeper_Thal> 1.0 WILL NEVER LET GO
[3:31:10] <DensityD> why am I sitting here watching this
[3:31:31] <MKII> It's cool that a fan investigated the bug and they were like oh shit you're right that's our bad
[3:31:41] <%Felhad> Cause ponder the orb
[3:31:43] <%Chamapa_Stys> cause its nice and chill
[3:31:47] <%CzeekyTV> game good
[3:31:48] <MKII> then you have Capcom never fixing SFV one sided rollback despite everybody telling them it's broken
[3:31:49] <$yeknomlive> my war just hit 90. what kinda melds should i be going with
[3:31:51] <%abrupt_abe> Not using the new rotation Pat?
[3:31:58] <floatRand> I am crafting right now. I am also playing runescape. And watching stream. And making small code snippets.
[3:32:01] <+Edrem> it distracts me from the work that needs to be done before weekend
[3:32:05] <TurtlesAndTentacles> It's not like I can buy it lol
[3:32:06] <CyborgAV> This is the content you watch while you do the same thing on your own character
[3:32:07] <pixeldust48> i see so many streamers fishing in FFXIV and i thought fishing was streaming poison but i guess not???
[3:32:08] <floatRand> At 05:28, what the hell am I doing with my life
[3:32:09] <%transporterthesequel> I may or may not be waiting for an 85 dungeon to pop.
[3:32:13] <Ciglossonjr> Pocketwatch material
[3:32:17] <%Agami23> i mean, this is the type of shit that got me to play 14. specifically the fishing boat
[3:32:20] <Psyramics> it didnt change at all
[3:32:29] <XxMoliciousxX> I don't know the old one, kinda just fumbled through lvling
[3:32:30] <Shiranui24> yo what's up pat i'm sitting waiting at Chi how are you?
[3:32:30] <%abrupt_abe> I may have an image
[3:32:41] <%CzeekyTV> scrutiny > meticulous > scrutiny meticulous, then it branches depending on what the collectability is. throw solid reason in there once you're level 90
[3:32:59] <%CzeekyTV> yeah you're fine
[3:33:27] <floatRand> I've been using the RNG one personally once, then depending on collectability another one or meticulous.
[3:33:32] <+dawsfloss> Played this game for like 25hrs couldn't get into it, went back to ESO but these its chill to watch idk why
[3:33:39] <%walternatorz> bumpin' butts
[3:33:39] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[3:33:41] <chrishansen69_> touch his shower butt
[3:33:42] <Psyramics> on that omega grindset
[3:33:43] <%TerpanderLux> omega is a big weird cockroach
[3:33:45] <%Felhad> Back and forth forever
[3:33:51] <Comb711> oh I dislike this lmao
[3:34:00] <%Monkeyweed21> the joy of suffering through Hello World
[3:34:12] <%TerpanderLux> no
[3:34:15] <@QueequegTheater> PJSalt
[3:34:17] <@PrefectusCorgi> Not really
[3:34:17] <Justlaxy> sfhSMUG cool huh
[3:34:17] <MKII> where's their EW EX trial mount
[3:34:22] <floatRand> I should finish O12S. I got to O11S on patch, but static broke.
[3:34:25] <%walternatorz> and the gatherer establishes dominance over the other gatherer by flaunting its savage prowess
[3:34:25] <chrishansen69_> His shower butt impressive
[3:34:26] <pixeldust48> people on the source must be so confused by the amaro
[3:34:32] <%RealThiele> Mikoshi best mount
[3:35:01] <%Felhad> @pixeldust48 lol. as if there's not things infinitely crazier than a 4 winged horse
[3:35:04] <floatRand> Amaros are super cute.
[3:35:12] <marvel877> Just got back from Spider-Man. Shit's good.
[3:35:20] <%transporterthesequel> That's one hell of a sentence
[3:35:40] <%transporterthesequel> all my homies get pipe in garlemald
[3:35:54] <%CzeekyTV> i just buy the regular cordials for GC seals
[3:35:54] <nappingonstream> what server is pat on
[3:36:15] <%TerpanderLux> lmao
[3:36:19] <%Alazull> Yep
[3:36:19] <pixeldust48> ultros
[3:36:24] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt but now you get rng mounts/minoins with seals
[3:36:28] <MKII> no way bro buy GC loot boxes
[3:36:30] <Daniel_Is_I> But pet/mount loot boxes
[3:36:33] <%Felhad> You can also just buy um with gil
[3:36:39] <%RealThiele> also white scrips
[3:36:39] <nappingonstream> wait what
[3:36:40] <%CzeekyTV> you can get a weirdly high amount of really useful shit with GC seals you would never guess
[3:36:44] <nappingonstream> what pet boxes
[3:36:46] <%CzeekyTV> like spiritbonding food
[3:36:47] <LoreKeeper_Thal> GACHA THO
[3:36:55] <%Agami23> but what about the eureka ones?
[3:37:00] <nappingonstream> my main seal dump is glamor prisms and ventures
[3:37:07] <chrishansen69_> His shower butt showed the perfect male pattern baldness, we should touch it again
[3:37:20] <pixeldust48> of course they add the pet boxes when i already have 340 minions
[3:38:19] <pixeldust48> so i changed my fc tag to <<aeiou>> for this xpac
[3:38:40] <goddesstabrasa> flying tank is funny
[3:38:59] <LoreKeeper_Thal> @pixeldust48 JOHN MADDEN
[3:39:08] <Daniel_Is_I> Pat you only need 600 for these
[3:39:15] <floatRand> Man the new gathering interface it is so good
[3:39:17] <%CzeekyTV> DINK
[3:39:33] <nappingonstream> i have never seen the gathering interface in my life
[3:39:37] <chrishansen69_> Dang.. 599 was a dream
[3:39:38] <+Tonemanzero> hit the 5%
[3:39:42] <@QueequegTheater> DOINK
[3:39:48] <nappingonstream> this is the first time ive seen the pov of a noncombat job
[3:40:25] <%notsoy> what kind of tank is that? it makes me think of metal slug
[3:40:25] <%furiousfurioso> Why did you leave
[3:40:26] <chrishansen69_> the tank controls failed
[3:40:52] <floatRand> I've crafted 120 hq tinctures of strength. No end in sight.
[3:41:27] <pixeldust48> do you have a spreadsheet open?
[3:41:28] <%Agami23> with tits like his would you want them hidden away?
[3:41:35] <+R_BChe> been a great chill stream
[3:41:37] <%CalderGaming> @floatRand PotChamp
[3:41:43] <@goose_attack_almanac> Garleans can't afford textures
[3:41:43] <nappingonstream> viera men dont have tits
[3:41:45] <LoreKeeper_Thal> man remember the rock?
[3:41:48] <%InternetShis> The Pokemon tree
[3:41:58] <%Mekhet09> I hate this system. Just mae GP referesh after every use.
[3:42:01] <nappingonstream> no tits next to roes and hroth at least
[3:42:04] <%natjen8> Been loving the stream as i do my own gatherer stuff! Love this stuff
[3:42:24] <%Mekhet09> Make.
[3:42:24] <Daniel_Is_I> He wants GP to work like CP
[3:42:26] <%legendfather_of_giants> they want gp to be like cp
[3:42:28] <%Mekhet09> Like crafting.
[3:42:28] <%JoshManVGH> Make
[3:42:29] <chrishansen69_> LoreKeeper_Thal, yeah.. great soundtrack.. cheesy movie that shouldn't be brought up
[3:42:33] <%InternetShis> make
[3:42:35] <%Agami23> make it work like CP where it refills after every collection
[3:42:46] <MKII> if GP was infinite the item market would be ruined
[3:43:03] <%TerpanderLux> moon2W
[3:43:07] <Daniel_Is_I> Yeah fuck that
[3:43:07] <%Agami23> yeah
[3:43:18] <pixeldust48> slightly shorter cordial cooldowns is all i ask
[3:43:37] <%Mekhet09> I just wish there was less of a wait time.
[3:43:56] <%Monkeyweed21> GP regeneration should be determined by how based or cringe your gathering glamour is\
[3:44:24] <%Agami23> watch a streamer on the side or something
[3:44:26] <floatRand> I am literally playing other game while crafting/gathering
[3:44:26] <%TerpanderLux> B)
[3:44:29] <+polothegreatest> psaWhat psaWhat psaWhat
[3:44:35] <%DianaTheAscian> I'm doing this while watching Pat
[3:44:37] <Psyramics> GP regen is fine for when you're doing a collectable loop, and when you're gathering for mats, you only use GP to save time
[3:44:47] <+SaphronBlackbourne> Crashed, back into a 2k queue
[3:44:47] <%Mekhet09> I got mine all to 90. I know how it works. It's just not engaging and I wish it was lol.
[3:44:59] <vicar_anat> like Minecraft?
[3:45:11] <+Tonemanzero> I watched an insane amount of deep space nine while doing the firmament grind, zoning out is a must with these things
[3:45:25] <LoreKeeper_Thal> i don't think they can make it engaging
[3:45:28] <pixeldust48> the purpose is the make big bucks
[3:45:34] <haisho> ah yes firmament gathering
[3:45:40] <haisho> the bane of my existence
[3:45:42] <%EsotericOdyssey> ah
[3:45:47] <%EsotericOdyssey> i see you're in the carrot mines
[3:45:52] <%Mekhet09> I mean spear fishing is pretty great now.
[3:45:59] <rReizs> 1.0 gathering, engaging but fuck that for actually farming stuff
[3:46:01] <%TerpanderLux> what should i spend white gatherer scrips on? i already have all my 80 scrip gear
[3:46:09] <chrishansen69_> Rules of engagement for the 90s.. dont engage.. just be fun!
[3:46:17] <floatRand> Tokens first.
[3:46:19] <%Agami23> folklore maybe?
[3:46:21] <Psyramics> folklore tokens for books
[3:46:23] <+SaphronBlackbourne> Unpopular opinion but I wish there weren't systems to crafting and gathering, just "click to craft/gather thing"
[3:46:24] <%TerpanderLux> guess ill burn em on cordials
[3:46:25] <%walternatorz> white gatherers on tokens for books
[3:46:27] <+degenbtv> i powered through all three of the gatherers yesterday with the leves i saved up
[3:46:27] <%Mekhet09> Materia before it crashes if it's crashed tokens.
[3:46:28] <+RelikaNox> Folklore, then materia ig
[3:46:30] <+Ironbuttz> I completely zoned out, what are staples for?
[3:46:30] <%LaughingCatt> the books
[3:46:31] <%CzeekyTV> white gatherer scrips are good for the regional folklore tomes and gathering materia
[3:46:34] <%TerpanderLux> no im a noob at gathering
[3:46:35] <%Monkeyweed21> did they ever explain the crystals orbiting the moon?
[3:46:41] <haisho> folklore tomes then probably cordials
[3:46:47] <rReizs> if you want to experience 1.0 gathering go to the gold saucer and do mining/botany minigames
[3:46:47] <%Agami23> what does folklore do though?
[3:46:53] <%GarbageNirvana> I still haven't gotten a single one of those
[3:46:56] <haisho> materia if you're crazy and looking to make penta gathering gear now
[3:47:01] <%TerpanderLux> :)
[3:47:18] <%EsotericOdyssey> it's a fuckign
[3:47:18] <floatRand> Folklore basically reveals legendary nodes per region
[3:47:21] <%EsotericOdyssey> it's final fantasy
[3:47:22] <%Mekhet09> white scrips for materia the first week, is a good way to make cash.
[3:47:25] <%EsotericOdyssey> there's crystals
[3:47:25] <floatRand> Each gatherer job has 3 per new region
[3:47:27] <chrishansen69_> blue helmets, be more fun!! your not fun enough! thats why the enemy is firing at you
[3:47:27] <%TerpanderLux> icic
[3:47:28] <%EsotericOdyssey> what else do you want
[3:47:35] <%legendfather_of_giants> nah do it tho
[3:47:36] <+RelikaNox> I'm gonna be melding my stuff next week and I'm terrified of the pain again lol
[3:47:37] <floatRand> Each tome costs 16 tokens, which in turn cost 100 white scrip each.
[3:47:45] <%walternatorz> oof
[3:47:47] <Daniel_Is_I> OOF
[3:47:48] <%CzeekyTV> LUL
[3:47:50] <+RelikaNox> Oof
[3:47:55] <LoreKeeper_Thal> OOOOOOOOOOF LUL
[3:48:01] <%retrohazard> The lesson is that you don't get rich by spending your gil
[3:48:02] <floatRand> Crafting, everyone
[3:48:06] <%JohnAtDawn> That's why pentamelding is garbage
[3:48:08] <+SeventhVice> @PatStaresAt what, aside from pvp do you not enjoy about FFXIV
[3:48:09] <floatRand> I've been just slapping random shit so far.
[3:48:09] <pixeldust48> yay spending a whole day grinding for 2k white scrips for materia and none of the melds are successful!!! 🙃
[3:48:10] <haisho> I never did get melding priority for gatherers
[3:48:10] <%Monkeyweed21> why Penta meld when you aren't prog raiding?
[3:48:13] <+Tonemanzero> My assumption was that the crystal belt is a feature of zodiark being explosively unsealed initially
[3:48:25] <floatRand> I am not planning to get into high-end crafting, I just want to make tinctures and food at satisfying rate
[3:48:28] <%EsotericOdyssey> i don't know anything about materia
[3:48:30] <%EsotericOdyssey> beyond
[3:48:32] <%retrohazard> @Monkeyweed21 big number get bigger
[3:48:34] <%EsotericOdyssey> you put it in the holes
[3:48:37] <%EsotericOdyssey> to make number go up
[3:48:43] <%EsotericOdyssey> what is penta melding
[3:48:47] <%EsotericOdyssey> or overmelding
[3:48:53] <%TerpanderLux> monkaS
[3:48:57] <%EsotericOdyssey> i've heard those talked about but never understood
[3:48:58] <%Mekhet09> It can be.
[3:48:59] <%CalderGaming> aside from Expert Recipes
[3:49:01] <pixeldust48> crafting is for the GLAMOURS
[3:49:02] <floatRand> Oops
[3:49:03] <%TerpanderLux> what if i just wanna make the cool outfits
[3:49:07] <+killer_squid1990> Good food and potions = penta meld those accessories
[3:49:14] <%LaughingCatt> those ARE the money crafts
[3:49:14] <SirPeytonius> avoid crafting by crafting hard
[3:49:24] <%Mekhet09> @EsotericOdyssey You can meld more then your slots, up to 5 slots.
[3:49:25] <%CzeekyTV> tinctures were the hardest craft i regularly did near the end of shb, can confirm
[3:49:26] <rReizs> current tier tincture and foods are macro capable as of now with minimal materia, so for now materia pentamelds are for future proofing
[3:49:27] <floatRand> Do they release new pots with raids?
[3:49:28] <+LiberatedPhoenix> Oh shit, time for Radz music
[3:49:31] <+LiberatedPhoenix> Hit that.
[3:49:35] <%DianaTheAscian> what are textures?
[3:49:35] <+Tonemanzero> overmelding, the ultimate gambling system
[3:49:41] <+LiberatedPhoenix> catJAM
[3:49:44] <%Monkeyweed21> @BoxNavy that is the MOST INTENSE of crafting cuz people will pay like a million gil for a baseball hat or nice coat
[3:49:45] <+Ironbuttz> I only have crafters at 63, and I feel like I'm gonna have a stroke
[3:49:47] <+polothegreatest> Food? Thats the job i gonna lvl LUL
[3:49:57] <%DianaTheAscian> tintures*
[3:50:08] <%TerpanderLux> so dont craft. got it.
[3:50:09] <%retrohazard> 1st red is 17% now if you're using Grade VIII
[3:50:12] <%JohnAtDawn> Oh jesus I didnt know it went even lower than 15
[3:50:12] <Comb711> That sounds like a crazy person thing
[3:50:15] <%Mekhet09> And then you do it in 6.1 6.3 and 6.4
[3:50:18] <pixeldust48> do you not need specific crafters to meld specific equipment anymore?
[3:50:18] <chrishansen69_> ow wow.. that game is rigged
[3:50:19] <+Ironbuttz> WHY
[3:50:19] <+LiberatedPhoenix> @PatStaresAt How you like that Radz music?
[3:50:21] <+ZipperHands> burn through millions of gil
[3:50:22] <%RealThiele> goodbye money
[3:50:22] <+killer_squid1990> No, DO CRAFT, crafting is very fun
[3:50:23] <%GarbageNirvana> I pulled off a pentameld once
[3:50:25] <+M0untain_wolf> We need money and time
[3:50:26] <%GarbageNirvana> ONCE
[3:50:27] <LoreKeeper_Thal> you basicly create slots where there are none, that's the concept of overmelding
[3:50:27] <%EsotericOdyssey> @PatStaresAt does this apply to battle gear too?
[3:50:28] <%Monkeyweed21> coxJam
[3:50:33] <%CalderGaming> THE ROCK SALT TREND SPREADETH
[3:50:33] <Talinu> How long before the queues return to normal?
[3:50:33] <Psyramics> saw some screens today, 60 materia burned in a single attempt
[3:50:34] <rReizs> it used to be we had to meld each attempt individually, now we can mass gamble
[3:50:39] <%shurtal> LICK THE STONE
[3:50:40] <%RealThiele> at least it automatically eats the materia pile now
[3:50:42] <haisho> hold up
[3:50:44] <+killer_squid1990> @EsotericOdyssey It can
[3:50:50] <%Mekhet09> Here's a question why didn't you grab them before they were on the list?
[3:50:53] <%EsotericOdyssey> how do I unlock overmelding for battle gear
[3:51:00] <%CzeekyTV> @EsotericOdyssey it sure does. day 1 pentamelded raid gear goes for a really hefty sum
[3:51:02] <%EsotericOdyssey> what's the criteria for that
[3:51:11] <Daniel_Is_I> %-chance to increase your collectability gain on a hit
[3:51:15] <%Mekhet09> @EsotericOdyssey That's only crafted gear.
[3:51:16] <+killer_squid1990> @EsotericOdyssey Only certain gear can be overmelded I believe
[3:51:19] <haisho> it's the thing that buffs Meticulous and Brazen
[3:51:25] <haisho> I think
[3:51:28] <DrillStopsNoCops> Where do you exchange old scrips?
[3:51:35] <%abrupt_abe> Collectors focus works great
[3:51:55] <pixeldust48> the blacksmith filing is the single worst sound i have ever heard inb my life
[3:51:58] <chrishansen69_> is this ff xiv 2?
[3:52:02] <+LiberatedPhoenix> TRommmbonnne
[3:52:03] <R0DA> Hell yeah rads-at-han at night!
[3:52:11] <Daniel_Is_I> GarlandBell is updated for all of the white/purple scrips btw
[3:52:31] <%Felhad> Deez coconutz
[3:52:37] <%RealThiele> i actually miss Radz music from when it was sad
[3:52:45] <SirPeytonius> this song absolutely slaps
[3:52:49] <rReizs> gatherers just go for unbuffed meticulous and gamble on solid/ageless + wise
[3:53:12] <chrishansen69_> Hmm.. spectacular..
[3:53:34] <%baka_sugoi> M O O N
[3:53:41] <chrishansen69_> what are we doing?

[3:55:25] <Talinu> Wouldn't calling Viera rabbits be like calling you and I monkeys?
[3:55:25] <2Sam4Hall> Krile is wearing miqo'teface

[3:56:05] <+healnavi> This game needs a new client so bad
[3:56:10] <NBD_Rab> Krile's hood is appropriation
[3:56:14] <night__monkey> so like are we helping this guy fuck his student
[3:56:20] <pixeldust48> is "3 eyes" an insult to garleans
[3:56:25] <%Rumbutt> I wonder
[3:56:34] <%EsotericOdyssey> @NBD_Rab Krile has an M-Pass
[3:56:40] <%CalderGaming> @night__monkey other way around, if anything
[3:56:48] <rReizs> no we're helping his student fuck this guy
[3:56:53] <XxMoliciousxX> sushi?
[3:56:54] <LoreKeeper_Thal> back to kugane i see
[3:57:08] <%dankjerri> you are still going
[3:57:09] <chrishansen69_> he just chatting though
[3:57:09] <%EsotericOdyssey> @night__monkey we're helping her stand very close to him like sting didn't want her to
[3:57:11] <%senorpapel> @patstaresat just did trial one with a friend and we had some summoner who refused to stay in the multistack marker. People were dying to mechanics so we needed that body in the stack. Took 3 wipes until it finally clicked… they were from balmung.
[3:57:13] <%Alazull> We're going to Kugane so I can bang you in your homeland
[3:57:20] <%Mekhet09> The CUL quests are also a trip.
[3:57:26] <%Mekhet09> CUL/ALC.
[3:57:47] <pixeldust48> are the crafter quest cutscenes worth watching?
[3:57:58] <chrishansen69_> Mekhet09 I could never spell that
[3:58:08] <+Edrem> surely balmung players wouldn't mind stacking on one another
[3:58:11] <%NopeBadguy> cul/alc is a fun cooking adventure
[3:58:16] <%Puhff> i hope not!
[3:58:20] <%NopeBadguy> fsh is actually really interesting as far as the ecosystem goes
[3:58:29] <Talinu> You'd think they'd be somewhat worried about the happening in Garlemald and would want to help.
[3:58:30] <%doc_ock_rokc> weeeeeeeeebbbbbssss
[3:58:46] <pixeldust48> not gonna spoil but i was bored to tears during the tank quest
[3:58:47] <%senorpapel> @edrem  you’d think. But no, after the first hit this summoner kept running away.
[3:58:49] <%DianaTheAscian> rubble
[3:59:03] <%TerpanderLux> :)
[3:59:09] <%Agami23> i wish you could force them to do the kugane tower jump puzzle
[3:59:14] <%dankjerri> it is currently quicker to just make new characters on a full server than buy, wait for, and use a fantasia.
[3:59:20] <chrishansen69_> doc_ock_rokc, are you a real doctor and did you just diagnose us?
[3:59:23] <%TerpanderLux> do the jump puzlle right now you wont
[3:59:31] <+healnavi> You can't just call them Orientals, Tankin
[3:59:33] <%dankjerri> i say this to say Danker Jerri has been birthed
[3:59:35] <%Mekhet09> @dankjerri Can you even make new characters now?
[3:59:52] <%senorpapel> @pixeldust48  same. Had to hang out with my least favorite npc in my least favorite city
[3:59:54] <%doc_ock_rokc> @chrishansen69_ No i was talking about the professor and the assistant
[3:59:56] <pixeldust48> there are several jump puzzles in the ishgard housing district. there are zero rewards
[4:00:07] <%DianaTheAscian> I wonder if we'll ever see the rest
[4:00:17] <xDartuzax> Does this mean if your WoL did the puzzle they are canonically a crinimal?
[4:00:24] <%Felhad> psaMenace psaMenace psaMenace
[4:00:27] <%Monkeyweed21> DANGO?
[4:00:29] <%dankjerri> @mekhet09 if you refresh the list for half an hour like i did, yes
[4:00:38] <%Monkeyweed21> oh she wants his dango
[4:00:39] <pixeldust48> i just noticed his name is Tankin
[4:00:43] <chrishansen69_> doc_ock_rokc, Im no doctor.. so, what do we advice for the assistant?
[4:00:45] <Daikaiju1Sadism> Entering the last hour of my shift tonight and pat is exactly what I need.
[4:00:46] <LoreKeeper_Thal> OH NO SOCIAL LINK REVERSAL

[4:00:51] <+healnavi> @xdartuzax The player has to commit crimes anyway

[4:02:28] <%dankjerri> not the brynthos
[4:02:29] <monster_craft23> @PatStaresAt how long did you sit in queue today?
[4:02:43] <%Vyskus> Time to do hunts for tickets then lmao
[4:02:53] <Lynxystem> Omg, anybody see the STALKER 2 devs canceled their NFT plans almost exactly a day after announcement? LUL
[4:02:53] <XxMoliciousxX> wow pretty good
[4:02:57] <%dankjerri> on weekdays, youre good
[4:03:01] <+NickHatesSnow> Before 3pm for me
[4:03:02] <+R_BChe> i queue at 7 AM and it was only 50 people ahead of me everyday
[4:03:14] <%TerpanderLux> come to crystal we have erpers and decent queue times
[4:03:16] <+polothegreatest> Thank god
[4:03:17] <+healnavi> you mean an hour after kids get off school?
[4:03:18] <rasamune> @Lynxystem good
[4:03:18] <chrishansen69_> Dr octo, your 8 limbs are at risk
[4:03:23] <%Buttlo> The queue was only a little over five hundred for me last night at this time. Granted that may not mean much considering time but I was surprised.
[4:03:25] <Ciglossonjr> Why is it always midway through 4pm? I’ve noticed it too
[4:03:31] <%Mekhet09> Also, I have to say unlike every other quest Dragoon should be done before HW otherwise you get a time break unlike every other class which doesn't have important characters, staring the quest.
[4:03:35] <%dankjerri> Box is right, diabolos is so quick most days
[4:03:55] <+healnavi> @ciglossonjr It's an hour after kids get off from school
[4:03:55] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[4:04:08] <%dankjerri> @ciglossonjr the salarymen get home
[4:04:10] <%Vyskus> It sucks to be an Aether boi sometimes
[4:05:00] <Ciglossonjr> @healnavi that may make a bit of sense, although idk why I have this strange idea that teenagers don’t play xiv
[4:05:00] <Lynxystem> rasamune ikr? never have i lost interest in a highly anticipated game that fast, lol.
[4:05:24] <Ciglossonjr> @dankjerri isn’t 4:30pm way too early for people to be done with work?
[4:05:28] <%dankjerri> i will get an apartment in ishgard for sure
[4:05:30] <gryffinp> does it bother anyone else that this theme draws from the "Storm of blood" leitmotif, which is derived from gyr albania culture rather than far east culture
[4:05:38] <%walternatorz> I was dissapointed that the thavnarian consulate didn't comment on you saving them
[4:05:39] <+healnavi> @ciglossonjr kids absolutely play MMOs
[4:05:42] <+Edrem> sure it won't just be firmament theme?
[4:05:42] <%SveriSageAdvice> not rickrolling, but he is PATRolling
[4:05:51] <%senorpapel> Ishgard theme is the best
[4:06:02] <%EsotericOdyssey> frankly I'd take even the limsa theme over the kugane theme'
[4:06:32] <%Buttlo> Is there an ideal way to level up crafters and gatherers? As in, start with X class to make the rest faster?
[4:06:33] <%SveriSageAdvice> man now that im reflecting on it, that was the lamest pun i've made
[4:06:40] <%dankjerri> @patstaresat why is The Goblet for broke asses? i have heard this sentiment a couple of times
[4:06:55] <tanarath> Baby snore
[4:06:59] <%Akizea> @dankjerri casue its the ugliest looking one
[4:07:00] <XxMoliciousxX> cus it's the ghetto
[4:07:03] <%SveriSageAdvice> oh Goblet is the most undesired housing area
[4:07:15] <Ciglossonjr> Nah man, the Garlean 9.96fm radio is the suicide theme
[4:07:15] <RetributionP> @pixeldust48 all of the cut scenes are worth watching
[4:07:23] <%dankjerri> but for why? it sunny.
[4:07:34] <+BlubRobe> I like The Goblet...
[4:07:42] <%Buttlo> @dankjerri Closest to the Lalafell
[4:07:43] <+healnavi> @retributionp there are absolutely some cutsvenes that aren't worth the time
[4:07:45] <dinnydanny777> limesShy
[4:07:54] <+healnavi> the problem is you'd never know in advance
[4:07:59] <+wmeldrum> damn you third-wheeling hard
[4:08:04] <%transporterthesequel> HAIRPIN IS NOT A DICK
[4:08:05] <%TerpanderLux> yeah :)
[4:08:06] <%dankjerri> DIG IN THE SHOALS, FUCKER
[4:08:11] <Ciglossonjr> Holy shit she’s crying
[4:08:13] <gryffinp> I skip every wandering minstrel cutscene
[4:08:15] <+Tonemanzero> Goblet is fine but most people don't want to a foggy canyon for a view.
[4:08:16] <+TromboneSolo> Hell;s Lid?
[4:08:20] <%Mekhet09> I hated this so much it's near the heaven on high area.
[4:08:22] <%ElkRiverDog> Dude, she's crying NOW
[4:08:23] <%Agami23> they actually also added a bunch of fishing points in the ruby sea which i was not expecting
[4:08:25] <%DianaTheAscian> Oh male Viera do that as well
[4:08:32] <RetributionP> @healnavi That is extreme circumstances
[4:08:40] <%dankjerri> super fast
[4:08:40] <doggieo> DI... oh a hairpin
[4:08:46] <moonwraithgwen> is this game as bad as everyone is saying?
[4:08:50] <chrishansen69_> did the dr leave? I might have unexplained complaints!
[4:08:53] <monster_craft23> i feel like you have to be pretty deep into this game to understand anything that is going on
[4:08:58] <%walternatorz> ruby sea pat
[4:09:04] <%walternatorz> ain't that next door?
[4:09:05] <gryffinp> you already went to the moon and back, he probably reasonably expects that you are magic and do whatever you wish
[4:09:09] <rReizs> the ruby sea is right next to kugane
[4:09:11] <XxMoliciousxX> this is just gatherer right?
[4:09:14] <%Rumbutt> Okay but that's more reasonable than the people who ask you to kill gods kind of
[4:09:17] <%dankjerri> is pat in Xangia rn
[4:09:35] <Talinu> It' would be like telling you to go get something in Toronto.
[4:09:45] <+healnavi> except in Heavensward where it's way closer in scale than the rest of the game
[4:09:47] <%dankjerri> i have played through STB several time, i have not gotten flight in it ever
[4:09:51] <%Monkeyweed21> you can see large parts of Azim Steppe you cant go to
[4:09:54] <Srthunda> the reason is that you cannot gather materials in kugane and the ruby sea is closest
[4:09:57] <%doc_ock_rokc> what does that mean? that boy need theropy
[4:10:00] <%Ynkubus_> Your also only in a apart of the steppe, not all of it
[4:10:01] <%Buttlo> Wouldn't they be kilometelms
[4:10:05] <Mexrage> you are only on important areas of the world, a small portion of the each region
[4:10:09] <+healnavi> also the Garlemald map is the most condensed map in the game like holy shit
[4:10:16] <%TerpanderLux> no

[4:10:28] <%Guardiansaiyan> hello again!
[4:10:30] <Daniel_Is_I> They'd be malms because it's Imperial
[4:10:34] <+Tonemanzero> isn't malms just km anyways?
[4:10:41] <Ciglossonjr> Honestly I was a bit let down that Garlemald was only one zone
[4:10:47] <+healnavi> malm = mile
[4:10:48] <%Mekhet09> Same.
[4:10:49] <%Rumbutt> Malms is miles
[4:10:53] <FelixAyada> LUL

[4:13:13] <Savage_Howitzer> hi Pat
[4:13:15] <+polothegreatest> KappaClaus
[4:13:18] <%dankjerri> i actually thought it was the sound of your mount
[4:13:24] <%strakillias> Has Zangief made a groove in Paige's part of the couch yet? He a big boy
[4:13:29] <gryffinp> @vetrag07 if you're early in the game then pick one of the ones in your starting city (except fishing), otherwise they all tend to feed into each other, so just pick one randomly to start with the basics of crafting and see if its to your liking.
[4:13:31] <Savage_Howitzer> coxWha
[4:13:43] <+cascadepersona> Pat, what's your fondest memory of Stormblood?
[4:13:56] <vetrag07> thank you
[4:14:07] <0rbis> eureka emoneyPain
[4:14:09] <%Felhad> always little sun
[4:14:09] <+cascadepersona> lol
[4:14:10] <%JohnAtDawn> LITTLE SUN LUL
[4:14:12] <%Buttlo> Any time Daddy Dumptruck faces away from the camera.
[4:14:13] <%dankjerri> that isnt even the actual expansion
[4:14:16] <%Vyskus> Yeah that's fair
[4:14:19] <%JohnAtDawn> THE BURN (SAVAGE)
[4:14:19] <DrillStopsNoCops> coxBAm
[4:14:22] <DrillStopsNoCops> coxBam
[4:14:22] <%Agami23> little sun was brutal
[4:14:25] <%dankjerri> thats in a patch
[4:14:31] <+ThomasOfTroy> Is pat's cam/mouth movements out of sync with the audio or am I crazy?
[4:14:36] <%croxeye> Sadu and Cirina kissing in a tree being "gal pals"
[4:14:36] <gryffinp> sadu generally being cool and hot
[4:14:41] <%Ynkubus_> This kills the Magnai
[4:14:42] <%dankjerri> alright thats fair
[4:14:48] <+cascadepersona> true, true
[4:14:49] <%Guardiansaiyan> @PatStaresAt whos your least favorite Ascian?
[4:14:52] <%Monkeyweed21> Lakshmi's dance is also great
[4:14:53] <+healnavi> I liked Hien's N64 textures
[4:14:55] <Shiibbae> ENJOY THE REVELRY
[4:14:55] <%senorpapel> Pat, what’s your least favorite part of stormblood?
[4:14:55] <%Vyskus> REJOICE
[4:14:55] <%SveriSageAdvice> @ThomasOfTroy you might need to refresh your page
[4:14:57] <%Felhad> @thomasoftroy refresh the stream
[4:15:03] <%GarbageNirvana> Wild and pure and FOREVER FREE
[4:15:04] <%dankjerri> i remember i got to do the mash, and i got big hype
[4:15:16] <Shiibbae> not even tsuki?
[4:15:16] <%Monkeyweed21> thats wrong but ok
[4:15:17] <+Ironbuttz> Tsukiyomi was a cool fight
[4:15:20] <Srthunda> that cats head is far too small
[4:15:22] <+healnavi> but Susan is a primal
[4:15:25] <vetrag07> he already has that mount!
[4:15:25] <%Mekhet09> Lakshimi was cool so was susanoo. How can you hate susanoo.
[4:15:25] <chrishansen69_> what the heck he's the smallest!
[4:15:31] <moogleboy1984> Yo, was that the Lynx?
[4:15:31] <%dankjerri> tsukiyomi extreme
[4:15:33] <%Monkeyweed21> Is it because DRK wasnt good in StB?
[4:15:39] <+Tonemanzero> Suzaku was probably the only trial I liked in stormblood
[4:15:52] <Ciglossonjr> I love how they westlemania slam-dunked Magnai getting literally no game. To the point where Sadu x  Cirina became really popular
[4:16:00] <%dankjerri> mmm macros
[4:16:19] <%Mekhet09> Don't do the dragoon quests after HW it just feels weird.
[4:16:19] <haisho> there's a part of me that wants to try Zodiark Extreme because it's just pure mechanics
[4:16:21] <%dankjerri> put this in your hair and smoke it
[4:16:25] <%JohnAtDawn> Man apparently I was not doing collectables right at all
[4:16:38] <+Tonemanzero> Magnai is a fantastic punching bag
[4:16:46] <%Agami23> how often does the protag jump into volcanos for other peoples bullshit, i can think of at least 3 times
[4:16:50] <%MaritimeFox> Does DRK get good? I'm at lvl 35 now and it feels a bit one-note.
[4:16:52] <%G_Thunders> @haisho half the fight is solving 3D puzzle problems with an increasingly shorter timer
[4:16:58] <+SaphronBlackbourne> Sadu is aggressively lesbian and I love it
[4:16:59] <%JohnAtDawn> I was using all my gp on the enhancer move
[4:17:09] <+ThomasOfTroy> Reload and still seems out of sync, but if it's just me then whateves. As long as the stream's good for peeps
[4:17:10] <chrishansen69_> hairpin bullshit could make a girl pretty, or a voodoo doll
[4:17:15] <+ThomasOfTroy> reloaded*
[4:17:16] <Daniel_Is_I> For GRAPES
[4:17:17] <%abrupt_abe> For 'grapes'
[4:17:18] <+RelikaNox> Grapes are serious business
[4:17:23] <%G_Thunders> @haisho it’s fantastic
[4:17:24] <MKII> just azem things
[4:17:30] <%dankjerri> grapes are delectable
[4:17:35] <%dankjerri> not as good as raisins
[4:17:39] <+RelikaNox> Emet just FML
[4:17:41] <%dankjerri> superior grapes
[4:17:41] <haisho> is the other half praying RNG doesn't murder your uptime?
[4:17:41] <%senorpapel> Wol immune to lava confirmed?
[4:17:47] <%hoodedlefty> and that was in a past life
[4:17:48] <XxMoliciousxX> lol it's raining now, how anime
[4:17:54] <Ciglossonjr> Wait, it’s all grapes?
[4:18:05] <%Alazull> Now kith
[4:18:07] <+healnavi> SMASH THE FLOWER
[4:18:07] <%dankjerri> ...s-senpai...
[4:18:12] <%Guardiansaiyan> lol
[4:18:16] <chrishansen69_> grapes gaves chat just enough vitamin c to survive scurvy
[4:18:19] <%Ynkubus_> @senorpapel lava has a habit of getting out of the WoLs way when needed
[4:18:21] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> fucking kiss losers
[4:18:22] <night__monkey> he's so in
[4:18:27] <%Dakuu75> SO... MUCH... THIRST...
[4:18:28] <%dankjerri> oh no its alphys
[4:18:43] <%senorpapel> @haisho  usually no rng in extremes, mechanics happen in a set order
[4:18:47] <Ravingpyro> the thirst is real
[4:18:55] <%Buttlo> Profess your love already professor.
[4:19:02] <+healnavi> don't fuck the students
[4:19:02] <+Tonemanzero> Thirst the questline
[4:19:16] <%Vyskus> This slowburn fanfic sucks
[4:19:17] <%dankjerri> professor student relationship seems inappropriate but hey, anime is weird
[4:19:23] <haisho> @senorpapel there's a point where Zodiark sets up two AOEs. One allows MAXIMUM DEEPS, the other kills melee damage
[4:19:30] <GemeSvev> This questline reminds me of college professors I had, who married when one was the other's student.
[4:19:53] <%Dakuu75> oh SIC~! I jsut got Stormblood credits
[4:19:57] <+LiberatedPhoenix> Wait what
[4:19:59] <+ThomasOfTroy> @GemeSvev Hot
[4:20:00] <+LiberatedPhoenix> He's not Xaela...
[4:20:00] <%kyh9> Did they name a place after WoL?
[4:20:00] <%Agami23> yeah wtf
[4:20:02] <Daniel_Is_I> He might be from a Steppe tribe
[4:20:03] <%Agami23> he is a raen
[4:20:04] <+LiberatedPhoenix> PLOT
[4:20:05] <+LiberatedPhoenix> WTF
[4:20:05] <+healnavi> pat...
[4:20:07] <2Sam4Hall> raen are from there to they just got kicked out for being nerds
[4:20:08] <%senorpapel> @haisho  oh wait. I do remember that one. You gotta be either behind the boss or away from him
[4:20:10] <%Ynkubus_> Raen left millenia ago
[4:20:13] <%Agami23> he doesent know shit
[4:20:14] <%Visorak6> ?
[4:20:15] <+healnavi> RAEN ARE CLOSER TO KUGANE PAT
[4:20:17] <+Edrem> Raen also used to be there
[4:20:20] <+Mythicalbrit> The Rain came from the steppe but were driven out long ago
[4:20:22] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt the Au Ra ran away from the steppe to live underwater
[4:20:22] <gryffinp> I blame the localizers
[4:20:27] <%senorpapel> Luckily if you are reaper your finisher is ranged
[4:20:37] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> He is, most if not all Au Ras orginatied in the steppe
[4:20:38] <%Ynkubus_> Raen left to explore the world first
[4:20:38] <%dankjerri> its still an ANCESTRAL home
[4:20:41] <@SpaceCapnCrone> and then Sadu punches him in the throat and he DIES
[4:20:44] <pixeldust48> ey i finally logged in, time to stream snipe
[4:20:44] <Mexrage> xaela also came from anzim steep, raen are the ones that left azim steep
[4:20:46] <+BlubRobe> Could just be fudging it. They do that sometimes with NPCs don't they
[4:20:47] <Daniel_Is_I> They didn't START in the sea
[4:20:54] <%Guardiansaiyan> DA MOOOOON
[4:20:55] <Psyramics> pretty sure the xaela pushed the raen out of the azim steppes
[4:20:57] <Ravingpyro> aeiou
[4:20:59] <%dankjerri> no moon
[4:21:03] <%Agami23> arent the raen a bunch of cowards?
[4:21:05] <chrishansen69_> da moon, lets go there!
[4:21:07] <%dankjerri> no
[4:21:08] <%TerpanderLux> no :)
[4:21:10] <+RelikaNox> john madden john madden
[4:21:10] <Ciglossonjr> Only a small minority of Raen live under water
[4:21:12] <%senorpapel> @patstaresat  so does that mean raen are crabs and not dragons?
[4:21:15] <+healnavi> are au ra just big rats

[4:25:07] <%dankjerri> next expansion all the crafter and gatherers better get new animations
[4:25:13] <@CreepyPorpoise> creepy49Glee
[4:25:17] <%TerpanderLux> between diadem and casually doing deliveries im at 84
[4:25:20] <chrishansen69_> why is revolver ocelot a thing>
[4:25:22] <Daniel_Is_I> Probably like 30 fates?
[4:25:26] <%RealThiele> LUL fuck causality
[4:25:26] <%fishmonger555> Got reaper to 80, they put money into that short questline goddamn]
[4:25:30] <%CzeekyTV> leveling and pentamelding my gatherers is taking about as long as it took to just level my crafters
[4:25:39] <%dankjerri> atey ate
[4:25:42] <%Vyskus> I level DRG tfrom 80 to 90 exclusively on fates, my brain is mush
[4:25:47] <%Monkeyweed21> gotta get 5000 gemstones
[4:25:49] <XxMoliciousxX> elpis?
[4:25:50] <moogleboy1984> the FSH quest has you bringing back samples from Zone 5 like, Butterfly Effect be damned
[4:25:50] <%Guardiansaiyan> ELPIS
[4:26:15] <%Vyskus> Are you *sure* you didn't want to join the cat cafe rp?
[4:26:20] <%senorpapel> Does anyone know what the gemstone vendors in radz and sharlyan sell? Or has nobody done enough fates yet?
[4:26:26] <%Guardiansaiyan> I just like how Elpis looks
[4:26:31] <haisho> actually now that this is almost relevant
[4:26:34] <+RelikaNox> no elpis
[4:26:35] <%TerpanderLux> o/
[4:26:37] <%dankjerri> they already know you
[4:26:39] <Ravingpyro> bug
[4:26:43] <%ahdurian> o/
[4:26:43] <+donpatrondx> radz has a bow
[4:26:47] <%afronooch> o/ only, unless im playing on PC
[4:26:48] <%legendfather_of_giants> @senorpapel mount for 50k
[4:26:50] <haisho> is the CUL collectable the best one for purple scrip grinding because ugh sugar
[4:26:54] <+donpatrondx> the cute bow with th gold trim
[4:27:00] <chrishansen69_> you mean old school red baret ocelot, or new hype dont have a personality ocelot?
[4:27:02] <%Vyskus> Can confirm, am babby
[4:27:13] <%HotSauceFiend> so for the uneducated: Are fates like random world events/spawns?
[4:27:13] <%senorpapel> @legendfather_of_giants  oooh. 50k is pretty cheap. What mount is it?
[4:27:17] <%dankjerri> this seems excessive
[4:27:26] <pixeldust48> if you see a blue ninja with a santa chocobo dats me
[4:27:36] <haisho> quite normal if people are FATE grinding
[4:27:36] <Ciglossonjr> Lookin like birdemic
[4:27:44] <%G_Thunders> @hotsaucefiend they can be world bosses too sometimes but yeah
[4:27:48] <%dankjerri> just use lb
[4:27:50] <%senorpapel> @hotsaucefiend  yeah. Just things out in the world that sync you to their level
[4:27:51] <2Sam4Hall> RDM aoe is annoying, especially when stuff is dying fast
[4:27:51] <raineedaydreams> red mage fate farming sucks
[4:27:56] <%Dakuu75> dude, WUT is the deal with the "Scion Traveler's Mask" why does it MELT my face???!
[4:27:58] <%legendfather_of_giants> @senorpapel 50k gems
[4:28:00] <%Buttlo> atpBird
[4:28:13] <%senorpapel> @legendfather_of_giants  oh
[4:28:14] <%Guardiansaiyan> A fleet of Fate hunters
[4:28:16] <%senorpapel> Ooooooh
[4:28:23] <%Guardiansaiyan> DO IT
[4:28:26] <%Guardiansaiyan> lol
[4:28:28] <%Visorak6> (through)
[4:28:29] <%TerpanderLux> yeah blow
[4:28:32] <%vivaldiva> psaDown
[4:28:40] <Ciglossonjr> Fate farming is the reason for blu’s existence you coward level it
[4:28:41] <animaturgy> @PatStaresAt How hard do you thinking farming the omega mount/shadowbringers mecha dragon is now?
[4:29:11] <RetributionP> hahaha
[4:29:19] <chrishansen69_> No balls is  coward
[4:29:20] <nappingonstream> pat why are you hardcasting veraero and verthunder
[4:29:20] <%MaritimeFox> A naked Verthunder, no setup? He's getting back into the groove, I guess...
[4:29:23] <%Dakuu75> nnnnn-not easy
[4:29:24] <chrishansen69_> I rated
[4:29:26] <jmft2000> psaBougie
[4:29:26] <%RealThiele> i hate that that the niche for BLU is to ruin fates
[4:29:43] <nappingonstream> verthunder 2 is the aoe
[4:29:43] <gryffinp> verthunder TWO
[4:29:47] <%TerpanderLux> ye
[4:29:48] <raineedaydreams> ye
[4:29:49] <%Vyskus> Yeah, the AOE is the reverse
[4:29:52] <nappingonstream> yes
[4:29:52] <%CzeekyTV> aoe and single target are swapped in which one you hardcast
[4:29:52] <+Tonemanzero> Impact into ver 2
[4:29:53] <%GarbageNirvana> BLUs can't do EW fates yet
[4:29:53] <%senorpapel> @animaturgy  prolly pretty hard for omega. Cuz stormblood unsyncing is not working correctly
[4:29:59] <%GarbageNirvana> or well
[4:29:59] <moogleboy1984> AOE: Elemental < Non-Elemental
[4:30:05] <raineedaydreams> Acceleration also gives instant Impact cast now
[4:30:07] <animaturgy> Oof
[4:30:26] <+Tonemanzero> no they are right I am bad
[4:30:30] <+WRATHZOG> Acceleration change messed me up for a bit
[4:30:35] <2Sam4Hall> I like new accel
[4:30:35] <moogleboy1984> And it buffs Impact too
[4:30:37] <RushUnplugged> acceleration is so good now, it's an added swiftcast, perfect for openers
[4:30:52] <%Fadedblank247> its after your melee combo
[4:30:58] <RushUnplugged> and Manafication is just "lol get to the combo now"
[4:31:02] <%CzeekyTV> your melee combo procs verholy/verflare
[4:31:02] <Azaius> after you get 60 mana you spam 3 AoEs and get your single target combo
[4:31:04] <%JoshManVGH> Holy requires you to execute your melee combo
[4:31:09] <%JoshManVGH> Yep
[4:31:18] <chrishansen69_> aoe is moogleboy1984, blue helming. in the 90s targeted answers are allowed
[4:31:23] <%TerpanderLux> displacement and engagement do the same amout of damage now
[4:31:33] <%senorpapel> Anyone know if stormblood stat syncing is still broken in undersized parties?
[4:31:34] <%JoshManVGH> And scorches later combo action is a line aoe
[4:31:43] <night__monkey> Red Mage is actually cracked now
[4:32:00] <+WRATHZOG> Yeah it's in a great place
[4:32:02] <%TerpanderLux> i gotta try nu rdm
[4:32:06] <RushUnplugged> RDM is really good now
[4:32:28] <moogleboy1984> @chrishansen69_ Are you having a stroke?
[4:32:30] <RushUnplugged> I mean it was a good, comfy class, now it flows even better and has more dps
[4:32:41] <%HotSauceFiend> So in this game, is a red mage more useful as a fast-casting healer or magic dps?
[4:32:48] <+UltraViolet371> at 60/60 mana, do three moulinets for your AOE finisher
[4:32:53] <chrishansen69_> moogleboy1984, just having a stroke of history
[4:32:57] <nappingonstream> rdm is entirely a dps
[4:33:01] <Azaius> @PatStaresAt you can use 3 Enchanted Moulinet to get the mana too
[4:33:05] <+WRATHZOG> It's all DPS w/ a splace of being able to rez fast
[4:33:06] <2Sam4Hall> for aoe, yes
[4:33:07] <nappingonstream> rdm's heal doesnt scale at all
[4:33:07] <gryffinp> moulinet is aoe sword
[4:33:07] <%TerpanderLux> wait what
[4:33:07] <%CzeekyTV> @HotSauceFiend roles are very strict, a red mage playing as a "healer" would be harbo
[4:33:09] <%CzeekyTV> garbo*
[4:33:13] <%JoshManVGH> For Aoe yeah
[4:33:13] <+WRATHZOG> splace?  splash
[4:33:18] <gryffinp> three moulinets unlocks holy/flare
[4:33:19] <%TerpanderLux> oh aoe
[4:33:19] <RushUnplugged> 60/60 for aoe, 50/50 for single
[4:33:20] <DrillStopsNoCops> @HotSauceFiend RDM is a DPS with support
[4:33:22] <%senorpapel> @patstaresat  what music does that omega mount play?
[4:33:23] <gryffinp> it was a change
[4:33:24] <%HotSauceFiend> harbo got it
[4:33:25] <%Vyskus> yeah they changed it, you just have to do *any* three melee moves
[4:33:26] <nappingonstream> that said, rdm gets to always have a fast raise up
[4:33:29] <%LaughingCatt> 3 Moulinet instead of single target combo
[4:33:30] <RushUnplugged> melee > holy/flare > scorch
[4:33:30] <2Sam4Hall> It gives you holy same as melee combo
[4:33:40] <%EsotericOdyssey> no no, holy comes after the moulniets
[4:33:53] <nappingonstream> so while they are a strict dps, they have some nice support tools including a party buff
[4:33:53] <%JoshManVGH> 50 for single target, 60 for AoE target
[4:33:59] <+UltraViolet371> yeah in AOE moulinets go into holy/flare
[4:33:59] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[4:34:01] <%Agami23> god i love the change to manaficaiton
[4:34:04] <%Fadedblank247> yeah they lowered it down from 80
[4:34:19] <SinisterBroccoli> 60 for aoe
[4:34:33] <Azaius> you build less manas from jolt/thunder/aero by a similar amount
[4:34:44] <%JoshManVGH> Moluninet is a cone 3 of them gives 3 mana stacks which get you VerHoly or Verflare.
[4:34:47] <nappingonstream> in ff14, red mage's melee becomes something more intersting with several abilities that are charged by casting
[4:34:51] <gryffinp> one weird consequence is that now the fastest way to build meter is to spam aoes
[4:35:06] <%JoshManVGH> Also Manification just gives you 50 w/b mana
[4:35:40] <chrishansen69_> yeah scorch some stuff
[4:35:44] <%shootbang_exe> tweaked rdm feels really good now
[4:35:46] <Ciglossonjr> Btw is lassi actually good for nausea? Never had it before
[4:35:47] <%JoshManVGH> Yeah
[4:35:49] <%Agami23> yeah its a new change with EW
[4:35:50] <%shootbang_exe> yeah free 50/50
[4:35:52] <RushUnplugged> Manafication is just +50 mana now yes
[4:35:57] <RushUnplugged> and later you get STACKS of it
[4:35:58] <chrishansen69_> oh crap theres snakes!
[4:36:01] <%Mekhet09> What's your least favorite class pat? I personally don't like dancer.
[4:36:05] <+A0N33> Melee combo costs 50 and manafication now gives 50/50 yup
[4:36:19] <+UltraViolet371> yup, in AOE start with at least 10/10 and go into your moulinets right away
[4:36:23] <SinisterBroccoli> you don't get stacks of manafication
[4:36:28] <Azaius> stacks are acceleration not manafication
[4:36:29] <%JoshManVGH> So you can jump in melee combo jump out verholy scourch then do it immediately again
[4:36:35] <gryffinp> black mage is super cool
[4:36:41] <+WRATHZOG> Yeah, casters good
[4:36:42] <%LaughingCatt> BLM is very cool. & very hot
[4:36:42] <chrishansen69_> Call the colonel! he'll call em off to get a psg1!
[4:36:44] <pixeldust48> black mage is tiiiiiight
[4:36:44] <%shootbang_exe> black mage still shits out damage but moving still sucks ass
[4:36:45] <RushUnplugged> @SinisterBroccoli oh derp right, mana gets bonus damage
[4:36:47] <@CreepyPorpoise> I'm starting to understand blm and it feels kinda cool
[4:36:49] <%Agami23> they made it so black mage can actually run around now which is WILD
[4:36:49] <animaturgy> I don't like the new AoE rotation for BLM
[4:36:52] <%natjen8> black mage is Yoshi P's favorite job so of course its cool
[4:36:53] <%Mekhet09> SUM is kind of boring without weaves.
[4:36:54] <%JoshManVGH> Enochian not dropping seems cool
[4:37:04] <%JoshManVGH> Big booms without juggling
[4:37:14] <RushUnplugged> BLM actually moves now with Triplecast
[4:37:15] <gryffinp> you still want to not drop enochian, but its LESS punishing
[4:37:16] <Daxalog> Fire fire fire thunder switch into ice lightning right?
[4:37:17] <ValkahRoctsteel> Black mage is the most stressful leveling I’ve ever done.
[4:37:23] <%MaritimeFox> I too feel that SMN is kinda boring
[4:37:25] <%MaritimeFox> now
[4:37:27] <%Puhff> good enough for yoshi p; good enough for me!
[4:37:32] <%2DSuperiority> so many instacasts for BLM, RDM feels slower
[4:38:08] <%JoshManVGH> Where is SMN is basically a ranged melee class.
[4:38:13] <%Guardiansaiyan> Thank for going to Elpis!
[4:38:24] <%Guardiansaiyan> Appreciate it!! VirtualHug <3
[4:38:28] <%JoshManVGH> Slap that tre
[4:38:30] <%Mekhet09> Also, enkindle is such a loss of dps that SMN is now a ranged melee.
[4:38:36] <%Mekhet09> It's damage is awful now.
[4:38:49] <%TerpanderLux> chjbDance
[4:39:04] <%JoshManVGH> Wait how is Enkindle a loss of DPS?
[4:39:12] <chrishansen69_> this still the same game?
[4:39:32] <%MaritimeFox> Enkindle is a loss of DPS because it takes time?
[4:39:36] <RushUnplugged> ..Enkindle is an oGCD? how can you lose dps when you just cast it after other spells
[4:39:54] <%MaritimeFox> Yeah, I wondered about that.
[4:40:02] <@QueequegTheater> EX Trial 2 clear woo
[4:40:23] <%JoshManVGH> Tell us your secrets!
[4:40:25] <fistynopunches> congrats queequeg
[4:40:37] <%LaughingCatt> ... SMN doesnt even HAVE Enkindle any more, only Bahamut & Phoenix have it & they hit like freight trains
[4:40:38] <%MaritimeFox> Looks like a sleeping mask
[4:40:43] <chrishansen69_> your dps sucks pat.. its a fact. But how does this game know?
[4:40:51] <%Mekhet09> Sorry Rekindle.
[4:40:52] <Ciglossonjr> Should I level Paladin or Gunbreaker?
[4:41:06] <RushUnplugged> Miner DPS does suck
[4:41:08] <%Agami23> paladin
[4:41:08] <%Nekros4442> LICK IT
[4:41:27] <%2DSuperiority> the family rock salt yes
[4:41:39] <%JoshManVGH> Oh! The Phoenix Heal not being a Damage button is a loss of DPS, is that what you mean?
[4:41:39] <%TerpanderLux> this game just like minecraft for real
[4:41:50] <+Melthius36> are our crafters/gatherers in college now?
[4:41:52] <SinisterBroccoli> Anyone else having issues where the music in ffxiv is cutting in and out/
[4:41:54] <%Dakuu75> got the Shadowbringers title drop. (given me chills)
[4:41:55] <%HotSauceFiend> So i looked through the class list a bit and didn't see Blue mage anywhere. Surpised that never got  put in
[4:42:01] <+VoltecZero> white scrips exp gain is absolutely insane this expac
[4:42:02] <Daniel_Is_I> Oh yeah you're now at the point where it's a constant loop of collectables
[4:42:05] <%Maids4lyfe> why can't they just put the salt in the food
[4:42:05] <+Ironbuttz> can you explain what you're doing in the collectible menu?
[4:42:18] <%Nekros4442> the what
[4:42:20] <chrishansen69_> rock salted!
[4:42:21] <%TerpanderLux> campi
[4:42:24] <orogenesis> Rekindle is great for helping out during tank busters or when someone fks up so the healers wont have to use resources to heal that person
[4:42:38] <%JoshManVGH> What did Deathflair turn into for Demi Phoenix before?
[4:42:42] <orogenesis> its not a dps loss when its utility the hell LUL
[4:42:48] <Daniel_Is_I> Just finished crafting all my tools. NOW TO MELD.
[4:43:07] <+VoltecZero> screw healing other people, i use it on myself lmao
[4:43:10] <%2DSuperiority> Blu Mage will be a real job when we go to the New World for sure psaCrazyhead
[4:43:10] <%CzeekyTV> people just like to say things
[4:43:11] <%Kindan55> @hotsaucefiend they're in as a side class. can't use them in current content.
[4:43:12] <TheHauntedTank> what are you using to keep track of the node timers?
[4:43:17] <%TerpanderLux> robe bot...
[4:43:18] <Shiibbae> math bot
[4:43:21] <%Mekhet09> @PatStaresAt phoenix has more heals now. Leading to half the burst bahamut has.
[4:43:21] <%Nekros4442> isnt rekindle also just a too? Or am I wrong. I stil lhavent memorized everything on Summoner
[4:43:24] <+Melthius36> brother?
[4:43:26] <%Nekros4442> "ogcd"
[4:43:31] <Daniel_Is_I> I genuinely wish the scrip gear was better than even the most basically melded HQ gear.
[4:43:32] <RushUnplugged> I looove the construct mount
[4:43:37] <+VoltecZero> yeah it's ogcd
[4:43:39] <RushUnplugged> you just chill on its shoulder
[4:43:44] <%Puhff> what's that?
[4:44:09] <%Mekhet09> Scrip gear is terrible ATM. Each gear is limited to class.
[4:44:22] <%Nekros4442> Scrip gear looks fancy though
[4:44:25] <%Nekros4442> So that's nice at least
[4:44:29] <%Mekhet09> It's not likke landsaints.
[4:44:45] <haisho> speaking of melds, are pants always so weird to meld
[4:44:53] <raineedaydreams> the struggle of Bun
[4:44:58] <%TerpanderLux> owned
[4:44:58] <Kain5707> inferior race
[4:44:59] <animaturgy> Friendship ended with bunny
[4:45:00] <%walternatorz> that gatherer hat is dope
[4:45:05] <pixeldust48> tfw you are just a cute bunny twink who cannot wear hat
[4:45:05] <%Agami23> holy crap. i just saw that theres a collectable fish that can get you like 1400 red scrips per fish
[4:45:09] <+VoltecZero> oh dude, the spiritbond rate on gathering Folklore items is insane. You get 20% spiritbond per node
[4:45:27] <+FZeroDMX> And that’s why I stopped myself from switching to bun
[4:45:57] <$StrawberryPantsu> Time to wait for Chi
[4:46:04] <+VoltecZero> got XCOM'd
[4:46:11] <haisho> that thunk is the WORST thing you can hear as a gatherer
[4:46:14] <+Ironbuttz> thank you Pat
[4:46:20] <%FunkyStreams> A COCONUT??!?
[4:46:27] <Daikaiju1Sadism> awwwwww
[4:46:30] <haisho> it just makes you feel bad
[4:46:47] <%JoshManVGH> Yeah I don't think Rekindle is a DPS loss, Enkindle got a boost of 650 potency. So it seems like the damage from not having a dreadwyrm has simply been moved around.
[4:46:49] <%Buttlo> psaDogchamp smooch psaDogchamp the psaDogchamp pooch psaDogchamp
[4:46:55] <Daikaiju1Sadism> Cute
[4:46:55] <%Puhff> SHOW BABY
[4:47:04] <%NopeBadguy> alright I just got back
[4:47:08] <+Melthius36> how did you fail an attempt on 94%?
[4:47:12] <%NopeBadguy> are we still on min btn
[4:47:12] <%JoshManVGH> psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp
[4:47:21] <haisho> yes
[4:47:23] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Show Babooo
[4:47:34] <%CzeekyTV> directly comparing anything damage related about current summoner to past summoner is kind of a pointless exercise
[4:47:49] <+FZeroDMX> @joshmanvgh you used to be able to get 2 engineless in a bahamut phase, so it just got condensed into 1 cast
[4:47:55] <%RealThiele> this game uses X-com %
[4:48:00] <%NopeBadguy> that's fair
[4:48:03] <%vivaldiva> 94%? *laughs in xcom*
[4:48:06] <%legendfather_of_giants> you can do 1-2 crafters a night too
[4:48:06] <+FZeroDMX> *enkindles
[4:48:15] <%NopeBadguy> I wanna see you do fish or cul alc if you do this again tomorrow
[4:48:29] <%legendfather_of_giants> only like 10 per
[4:48:33] <Daniel_Is_I> Collectables are decent XP
[4:48:35] <%Mekhet09> You can do collectables.
[4:48:38] <+FZeroDMX> I’m finally leveling my crafters up and GC turning are a godsend
[4:48:41] <%Nekros4442> Do...you not have Leves?
[4:48:42] <%CzeekyTV> took me about 60 leves to get all my crafters up
[4:48:45] <%JohnAtDawn> Nah, if you have gatherers at 90, you can do collectables
[4:48:45] <%JoshManVGH> @fzerodmx Oh good point.
[4:48:47] <%JohnAtDawn> NOPE
[4:48:48] <Daniel_Is_I> No
[4:48:50] <%DEETRz> nope
[4:48:50] <%legendfather_of_giants> constant
[4:48:51] <dinnydanny777> This music gives me Evergrace vibes limesDance
[4:48:51] <Daniel_Is_I> Not since 5.3
[4:48:53] <Psyramics> no
[4:48:53] <FelixAyada> nope
[4:48:54] <%CzeekyTV> no, collectibles are static
[4:48:54] <%Mekhet09> Not that I've noticed.
[4:48:54] <%walternatorz> the turn ins don't
[4:48:58] <+Melthius36> i don't trust the percentages lol
[4:49:14] <Psyramics> now there's special collectable recipes
[4:49:18] <Daniel_Is_I> I just made like 50 of the level 81 collectables and powered to 90
[4:49:21] <%CzeekyTV> Definitely do your gold star GC turn-ins for leveling crafters tho!
[4:49:28] <%DianaTheAscian> images of the FF VI pixel remaster came out and it looks like octopath
[4:49:29] <%legendfather_of_giants> studium+10 leves will do a crafter too
[4:49:32] <%JoshManVGH> Eh, a 500 potency button in exchange for a beefy heal seems like a fair trade. If you can keep yourself, or a party memeber alive that a dPS gain compared to a death
[4:49:34] <%GarbageNirvana> I keep forgetting about GC turnins
[4:49:38] <Daniel_Is_I> MATH
[4:49:47] <%TerpanderLux> ok :)

[4:49:51] <%JohnAtDawn> GET THOSE BOOKS
[4:49:52] <%Cozy90> this sounds like that one song from tetris effect
[4:49:53] <Kain5707> why?
[4:49:58] <%Buttlo> What do the tokens do?
[4:50:01] <moogleboy1984> three books per class now
[4:50:01] <+Ironbuttz> for what exactly?
[4:50:03] <%Puhff> no
[4:50:03] <+VoltecZero> Folklore items
[4:50:05] <%NopeBadguy> for regional node unlocks
[4:50:05] <%CzeekyTV> Gold-starred crafter GC turn-ins give more exp than a leve
[4:50:16] <%Nekros4442> Gonna need them pretty soon to craft the shiny weps and new shit eventually
[4:50:16] <Daniel_Is_I> They let you get legendary materials which will be required for Expert crafts
[4:50:24] <+ccwettr123> other vendor
[4:50:36] <Kain5707> aaah
[4:50:40] <%JoshManVGH> Aaaah
[4:50:42] <+Melthius36> thats where the money is
[4:50:46] <%DianaTheAscian> ohhhhh
[4:51:09] <+ccwettr123> @PatStaresAt is there an easy way to see which folklore books you've already purchased?
[4:51:22] <%NopeBadguy> @patstaresat did you see the pso2 Twitter put out a silent hill 2 dog ending meme
[4:51:43] <+ccwettr123> ok, thank you!
[4:51:43] <+Ironbuttz> how kind of them
[4:51:45] <%GarbageNirvana> Never got this deep into crafting/gathering
[4:51:50] <%Puhff> wow rude
[4:51:51] <+Melthius36> way easier than it used to be to get folklore books
[4:51:55] <+degenbtv> unfortunately that dosnt work for the expert crafting books
[4:51:57] <%senorpapel> Question, is answers the best ff theme?
[4:52:10] <kinkade_77> Cool robot bug mount
[4:52:25] <%CzeekyTV> expert crafting is a scam >:(
[4:52:31] <+degenbtv> i have bought the same ones twice and couldnt use them later
[4:52:34] <%legendfather_of_giants> no it does, that's how I did it
[4:52:35] <%TerpanderLux> elmo noooo
[4:52:38] <%Cozy90> Pat did you watch the recent its always sunny?
[4:52:41] <%CzeekyTV> < salty about expert crafting rng
[4:52:42] <%JohnAtDawn> Wait what? No, it stops you from repeating the crafting books.
[4:52:45] <Daniel_Is_I> No it does work for the expert crafting books. I just tried to buy one and couldn't.
[4:52:58] <%legendfather_of_giants> I got my crafter books this week and it wouldn't let me rebuy
[4:53:04] <%Mekhet09> Did you do Omega unsynced for the mount?
[4:53:10] <%senorpapel> @degenbtv  it does work. You just gotta use the books
[4:53:21] <%DEETRz> more like goodbye world amirite
[4:53:23] <Kain5707> yes :)
[4:53:24] <pixeldust48> LMAO SAME
[4:53:25] <+Edrem> If you buy a master tome and put it in a retainer or saddlebag, the game will let you buy another one. That can screw up some people
[4:53:26] <%Mekhet09> How is it unsynced?
[4:53:27] <%thelaxinator> I’ve heard people who bought expert craft books, shoved them onto retainers and then bought another.
[4:53:31] <%FunkyStreams> ...no?
[4:53:32] <FelixAyada> goodbye world LUL
[4:53:36] <%thelaxinator> No idea why they did that
[4:53:38] <%DianaTheAscian> fuck doing that leget
[4:53:40] <%croxeye> i can't believe they named that quest Hello World XD
[4:53:41] <LittleBigQuebec> i did hello world legit
[4:53:52] <General_Terro> LUL
[4:53:53] <%Visorak6> lmao
[4:53:55] <%shootbang_exe> lol
[4:53:57] <%InternetShis> lmao
[4:53:58] <%CzeekyTV> that's hilarious
[4:54:03] <+degenbtv> lol
[4:54:04] <%shootbang_exe> I should take a stab at it with all 90's
[4:54:06] <aaubreyy> LUL
[4:54:07] <%JohnAtDawn> Goodbye World is trash for healers, just do the braindead. Wait, only two people? The version I saw had all four dps jump.
[4:54:08] <%Arkfyre> goodbye world is great, we did that for my fc too
[4:54:09] <%JoshManVGH> LUL That's amazing!
[4:54:13] <+ccwettr123> that... seems surprisingly effective considering rezmage
[4:54:20] <%DianaTheAscian> idk how to even do hello world
[4:54:24] <%RealThiele> suicide is badass
[4:54:28] <+ccwettr123> ah
[4:54:33] <%JohnAtDawn> And then the healers get slaty
[4:54:39] <%Alazull> !cheer500 Holy shit it feels so good playing SMN. Popping Searing Light right before Summon Bahamut with both Aetherflows up is such a nice burst window, just carving about 12-15% off a boss is *chef's kiss*
[4:54:47] <pixeldust48> you can do that with ozma too apparently
[4:55:02] <%DianaTheAscian> @patstaresat how long did it take to get it?
[4:55:04] <%rekinom> We did E12S today unsynced, you skip everything after basic relativity lmao
[4:55:19] <%Alazull> I could see that
[4:55:22] <+Domukari> wat
[4:55:23] <%Alazull> It is 30 seconds
[4:55:29] <orogenesis> you pop searing light immediately
[4:55:31] <+VoltecZero> On the 2nd EX Trial, I just straight up murder 1 crystal by myself using bahamut
[4:55:42] <orogenesis> because it is 30s and it will still align with other 15s 2 min buffs
[4:55:43] <Psyramics> that sounsd wrong cause then it would be out of alignment with everyone else's raid buffs
[4:55:48] <pixeldust48> titan is finally useful again... its been 84 years.....
[4:55:50] <+Melthius36> do you swiftcast slipstream?
[4:55:50] <%Alazull> Searing Light then bahamut
[4:55:55] <%LeiaSkynoober> Searing Light, then Bahamut
[4:55:57] <%Alazull> Because you can't use it during Bahamut
[4:56:06] <+Domukari> you have to searing light first but yeah basically
[4:56:17] <T_Sasquatch> now that ive finished endwalkers msq im so lost as to what to do now, im just starting at the screen indecisive
[4:56:21] <orogenesis> it will last because its 30s
[4:56:23] <%Puhff> Searing Light can only be done with Carbuncle out
[4:56:24] <+Domukari> yeah but searing light is 30 seconds
[4:56:26] <Psyramics> searing light is 30s
[4:56:29] <%GarbageNirvana> Man I wanna try new SMN but to do it on the character I'm playing now I'd have to start at level 1 again
[4:56:35] <%rekinom> They're earlier now, for instance, RPR's raid buff is literally the first GCD
[4:56:35] <%NopeBadguy> searing light is 30s
[4:56:36] <%LeiaSkynoober> The buff is long so it'll last
[4:56:36] <%Alazull> @PatStaresAt First and foremost I am not The Balance
[4:56:38] <gespenst25> You can't do it after Bahamut
[4:56:40] <Strigiform> because its 30s it catches all the 20s buffs on its back end
[4:56:42] <%senorpapel> I showed a person, who just jumped into ff, a video of o12s. And i gave them the timestamp for hello world. And they were like “why is this mechanic explanation 2 minutes long.”
[4:56:46] <RushUnplugged> yeah I guess it's because it's 30s and it's longer than most buffs
[4:56:54] <%CzeekyTV> this is true
[4:57:00] <%LaughingCatt> Plentiful Harvest is top priority
[4:57:06] <%Alazull> But you would probably start fight with Energy Siphon
[4:57:08] <aeonicVector> redmage can pop off into its burst at like 1 gcd aswell
[4:57:14] <%CzeekyTV> Reapers use the buff not for the raid, but so they can use Plentiful Harvest as early as possible LUL
[4:57:23] <%luftraumm1> pat why dont you enjoy EX fights, with your expertise it sounds like you would do great
[4:57:27] <%InternetShis> Crazy Noisy Beezar Town?
[4:57:27] <haisho> oh yeah Arcane Circle is literally the first oGCD they hit
[4:57:33] <%rekinom> you weave it in the first ogcd window after the first GCD which is shadow of death
[4:57:44] <%Visorak6> Pat doesnt do savage
[4:57:47] <%Visorak6> He does EX
[4:57:49] <aeonicVector> i cant believe pat is a certified Ex HATER
[4:57:50] <%LaughingCatt> Omega is a Savage Raid, not an EX trial
[4:57:53] <$StrawberryPantsu> He don't do Savage
[4:57:54] <DrillStopsNoCops> @rekinom WHAT? GAME'S CURSED?
[4:57:58] <+Melthius36> why don't you love ex harder?
[4:57:59] <%luftraumm1> oh might be thinking of savage
[4:58:04] <+cascadepersona> Pat doesn't do Savage
[4:58:08] <%NopeBadguy> does he mean savage
[4:58:14] <%CzeekyTV> @LaughingCatt he did it unsynced, so it's basically easier than an EX trial at that point
[4:58:15] <%DEETRz> omega is a savage but he didn't do it when it was current
[4:58:21] <%rekinom> @rekinom you follow it with soul slicex2 and then plentiful harvest and then SICKO MODE
[4:58:23] <%luftraumm1> yeah misspoke, savage
[4:58:28] <%afronooch> LUL
[4:58:34] <%senorpapel> @patstaresat  which is worse, hello world or light rampant?
[4:58:35] <meatgeneral69> this city theme slaps
[4:58:35] <%Guardiansaiyan> you 'work' nights
[4:58:36] <aeonicVector> So what your saying is savage sundays :P
[4:58:37] <$StrawberryPantsu> Then Stream it Kappa
[4:58:40] <RushUnplugged> progging savage is basically a 2nd job
[4:58:41] <%TerpanderLux> moon2W
[4:58:41] <T_Sasquatch> think of the CONTENT
[4:58:44] <+Ironbuttz> savage stream?
[4:58:45] <PanicSwytch> "work" nights
[4:58:46] <%NopeBadguy> then stream it 4Head
[4:58:49] <%luftraumm1> oh makes sense, what if you streamed savage?
[4:58:54] <DrillStopsNoCops> I can see why though. Big damage up, and it gets you right into Sicko Mode
[4:58:55] <Tracazoid> Well better now than never Kappa
[4:58:56] <+cascadepersona> Streaming Savage would be really hard
[4:58:57] <%Guardiansaiyan> "WORK" nights
[4:58:57] <Shiibbae> join NEST Kappa
[4:59:01] <pixeldust48> i'm a no lifer and i barely touch savage either
[4:59:02] <%LaughingCatt> @LaughingCatt yeah but doinf it unsynched is a far cry from doing it when its current
[4:59:10] <%luftraumm1> could file it under work lol
[4:59:12] <%NopeBadguy> join nest 4Head
[4:59:12] <aeonicVector> cause of us true
[4:59:13] <%rekinom> I used Namingway to rename Enshroud to Sicko Mode. Would recommend
[4:59:14] <%afronooch> Cant be on while doing savage
[4:59:16] <%Alazull> Guys no one would want to watch prog
[4:59:21] <%Visorak6> You dont want to hear people getting toxic/frustrated
[4:59:22] <+ccwettr123> teach Gief and Elmo to tank and Peach to heal and make it a family activity
[4:59:23] <aeonicVector> Pat 4 Nest
[4:59:27] <%GarbageNirvana> Everyone would be miserable
[4:59:29] <%DianaTheAscian> streaming savage sounds like a good way to die inside
[4:59:29] <%luftraumm1> yeah, it's kind of a dead end problem
[4:59:31] <%Mekhet09> exhausting.
[4:59:35] <%justcallmebobplease> But what if you hating streaming it does great numbers for you though?
[4:59:36] <Shiibbae> @Alazull you have no idea how wrong that is
[4:59:36] <%RealThiele> balls exposed every night
[4:59:40] <KenzBurp> with all the burger kings in here?  nahhhh
[4:59:41] <%walternatorz> it's a negative feedback loop
[4:59:42] <%DEETRz> streaming savage is not fun to watch cause chat can be tilting as well
[4:59:46] <%luftraumm1> it is exhausting indeed
[4:59:59] <aeonicVector> and NEST
[5:00:05] <%Alazull> @Shiibbae lol
[5:00:21] <pixeldust48> doesn't zepla stream savage? idk i barely watch her
[5:00:23] <+halfblackanthony> halfblackanthony subscribed with Prime. 
[5:00:37] <%luftraumm1> yeah world first is insanity, but managing to coordinate a team is very cool
[5:00:41] <+VoltecZero> This expansion savage raid streams are going to be wild with the Echo and Limit peeps joining in
[5:00:51] <%2DSuperiority> reject savage, gardening streams are gonna be the hot shit
[5:00:51] <%walternatorz> or you lean into the salt of it
[5:00:52] <T_Sasquatch> Most regular ff streamers do stream savage alot
[5:00:55] <%SirRazzle> I could see streaming something like that being ok as a stream for some people but viewers would probably be real low cause it's a pretty niche thing to watch.
[5:00:57] <%Visorak6> Yeah if you can 1-pull every fight in a tier I can see savage being *part* of a stream
[5:00:59] <%CzeekyTV> savage streams are only really interesting for other savage raiders imo lol
[5:01:08] <%RealThiele> MTQ is a champ
[5:01:08] <leinadtonu> Confirmed. Pat hates us. KappaClaus
[5:01:10] <%Cozy90> but pat ur teh bess
[5:01:13] <%luftraumm1> what are you taking about you're one of the most knowledgeable players in this game
[5:01:14] <+Ironbuttz> I didn't realize it was so in depth
[5:01:18] <%NopeBadguy> @patstaresat there are a few Savage streamers like Rin karigani that was running other content creators like Jesse cox through ucob
[5:01:22] <RushUnplugged> only one I found bearable to watch during savage is MTQ and that's because she already does guides lol
[5:01:30] <RushUnplugged> mizzteq is a goddess
[5:01:41] <aeonicVector> but is Drak better then you HahaThink
[5:01:45] <%luftraumm1> she is cool
[5:01:47] <@QueequegTheater> Mizteq is a fucking freak at FF
[5:01:48] <%CzeekyTV> LUL well put
[5:01:51] <orogenesis> LUL
[5:01:57] <gryffinp> I haven't finished this studium quest so maybe I should stop watching because spoilers, but on the other hand, to heck with this quest story
[5:02:00] <pixeldust48> MTQ guides have been carrying me for half a decade, damn
[5:02:09] <MKII> controller's holding you back like woolie and FPS games moon2S
[5:02:15] <+ccwettr123> Also gonna be interesting with a lot of people getting END for Christmas, probably gonna see another weird flux in twitch viewers
[5:02:16] <%RocketBarrel> Oh god its her
[5:02:18] <KenzBurp> but....but a GRIL CANT BE GUD AT VIDEO GAEM Kappa
[5:02:25] <%EsotericOdyssey> @QueequegTheater certified freak 7 days a week
[5:02:30] <aeonicVector> nah mk, its not, JP World Firsters use controller
[5:02:40] <%luftraumm1> but can we agree that pat is over critical of his skill?
[5:02:47] <+Melthius36> some real psychos from allag
[5:02:56] <%EsotericOdyssey> "we wish to recreate that place"
[5:02:59] <%EsotericOdyssey> bad idea
[5:03:06] <@QueequegTheater> @MKII World first raiders use controller
[5:03:11] <%CzeekyTV> pat has the skill for savage, he's done it before. he just emphasized the time commitment
[5:03:12] <%RealThiele> dont create birds you idiots
[5:03:28] <%Monkeyweed21> abuse time travel for exclusive crafting mats
[5:03:32] <haisho> so time commitments
[5:03:37] <RushUnplugged> most JP players are on PS4-5 so almost all controller regardless
[5:03:38] <+wizard_of_diamonds> That's fair
[5:03:39] <%walternatorz> ultimate stream when?
[5:03:43] <%CzeekyTV> heck, didn't you raid in the hardest savage tier to date? Gordias or whatever?
[5:03:46] <aeonicVector> you'd need a fun group to play off of, so yeah i get it
[5:03:46] <NBD_Rab> always mess with the past, maximum timecrimes
[5:03:48] <+ccwettr123> I think the biggest thing with skill is pat is out of practice and it would take weeks or months to get back to the point where he would be capable
[5:03:50] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> upi never know if you dont try
[5:03:54] <@QueequegTheater> Savage is TERRIBLE stream content
[5:03:54] <%luftraumm1> i wish there was a middle ground
[5:03:56] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> you*
[5:03:57] <%TerpanderLux> why tomorrow of course :)
[5:04:00] <@QueequegTheater> Never
[5:04:00] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[5:04:00] <%Guardiansaiyan> where the robes! @PatStaresAt
[5:04:04] <%Puhff> do it anyway
[5:04:05] <%DEETRz> ucob made me hate people so much
[5:04:07] <%RealThiele> UwU
[5:04:12] <zard9> hi elmo
[5:04:15] <+cascadepersona> Ultimates take weeks
[5:04:16] <$StrawberryPantsu> Elmo is posting cringe
[5:04:16] <%vivaldiva> psaPorgmo psaPorgmo psaPorgmo
[5:04:20] <%shurtal> elmo MUST communicate
[5:04:25] <+Melthius36> savage is cool for like the first 20 wipes
[5:04:26] <dinnydanny777> how does a garden hunger
[5:04:38] <TurtlesAndTentacles> I trust whatever you wish Sir Patrick of Closet Chocalate
[5:04:38] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt People don't even watch nuts like Sfia doing Ultimates unless it's for WFR
[5:04:45] <Ciglossonjr> I really really hope they touch on all of the bullshit in Gridania like Gelmorra and shit
[5:04:51] <Ciglossonjr> In the later expanisons
[5:04:52] <%Visorak6> halicarnassus
[5:04:54] <%walternatorz> the one with the role icons?
[5:04:58] <aeonicVector> omega ff5
[5:05:03] <@QueequegTheater> For your average HARDCORE player, Ultimates take like 50+ hours of prog
[5:05:04] <%valriot> Yeah that fight rules
[5:05:09] <%EsotericOdyssey> Halicarnassus
[5:05:13] <%Visorak6> books SUCKED for new statics
[5:05:19] <Blank9> savage is just too much trial and error unless you look up strats, and then it just feels like cheating
[5:05:27] <%Monkeyweed21> Halicarnassus is ROUGH on Savage
[5:05:29] <%valriot> LUL
[5:05:30] <jack_dt2> h
[5:05:32] <%Puhff> 60?!
[5:05:34] <moogleboy1984> You could at least be as interesting as Misshapen Chair
[5:05:55] <%Visorak6> Neo Exdeath was the only tier I bothered with savage and let me tell you Grand Cross is not a mechanic I enjoyed conquering
[5:06:12] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt To make it clear to people, Rich stream his TEA clear.  He had literally 7 of the best players on the planet carrying him and it still took him 400 pulls to clear
[5:06:19] <%G_Thunders> “Go risk some time paradoxes because I want some rocks. K thanks”
[5:06:23] <@QueequegTheater> Well, "carrying"
[5:06:32] <%bravebravesrobin> are you ready to toss a coin to your Witcher?  Alternatively, new season of The Expanse on Prime Video Cheer500
[5:06:57] <+yooniversal> why are you excavating for a civilization that still exists?
[5:07:10] <%RealThiele> ultimate Thoridan is gonna be nuts
[5:07:15] <%Puhff> idk who Rich is so I choose to believe that it's beloved internet darling, Rich Evans
[5:07:26] <%CzeekyTV> im happily savage/ultimate raiding but it basically consumes all my free time, between raid nights, research, and crafting prep
[5:07:27] <Blank9> I wish
[5:07:32] <+cascadepersona> Extremes can at least be learned in 1-3 sessions
[5:07:37] <+yooniversal> why don't you just go into a building and pick up some random shit?
[5:07:43] <%luftraumm1> ex is way more manageable
[5:07:46] <pixeldust48> @Puhff i need this
[5:08:05] <+ccwettr123> you heard him guys,gotta pass a law making every day 26 hours so pat can do savage
[5:08:05] <%NopeBadguy> time to steal the animals Kappa
[5:08:11] <%rekinom> streaming savage is a good way to make yourself hate the game and to lower your viewcount from what I've seen
[5:08:11] <%NopeBadguy> (I would never)
[5:08:18] <DirigibleDPlomo> everybody is obsessed with savage and ultimates in twitch
[5:08:31] <%Visorak6> I'm still tilted to this day that alte roite doesnt play the neo exdeath theme and just uses the sigmascape theme
[5:09:15] <Blank9> savage and ultimates are lame
[5:09:16] <%CzeekyTV> that's pretty silly. savage/ultimate is a small part of the game
[5:09:20] <Rixstarian> Completion for your char is whatever you want. Also, hi Pataru Paru
[5:09:21] <%Guardiansaiyan> Not with THAT attitude!
[5:09:22] <ohno778> just raid already
[5:09:22] <%Puhff> LUL
[5:09:23] <%afronooch> I'd argue you play "more" of the game by not progging
[5:09:28] <%Nekros4442> Clearing Savage content is like 20% of the community at best
[5:09:28] <%walternatorz> you would hate it
[5:09:28] <%RealThiele> WoW mindset of endgame is all
[5:09:29] <pixeldust48> this guy hasn't caught every single fish in the game? pfff
[5:09:31] <%Guardiansaiyan> oh
[5:09:36] <+Melthius36> i like the jokes more than savage
[5:09:44] <%Puhff> that kind of commenter has severe wow brain
[5:09:44] <%luftraumm1> savage shouldn't be the metric of how much you engage with the game
[5:09:44] <%Cozy90> yes
[5:09:45] <%walternatorz> you would get through half a stream
[5:09:46] <%G_Thunders> If you were good it would take 10 minutes. (I’ve never done a savage)
[5:09:47] <%rekinom> @Nekros4442 Way, way less actually
[5:09:52] <%DEETRz> you're not using penta melded crafter gear? pft what do you know about crafting
[5:09:57] <%JoshManVGH> I likely wouldn't watch cause that sounds painfully awkward
[5:09:58] <%Visorak6> And there's only so much you can foist on paige
[5:10:00] <dinnydanny777> limesShy
[5:10:01] <Tracazoid> "Sorry guys dog gooed on the rug"
[5:10:02] <Psyramics> 'hold on guys, gotta take gief out' and there goes 15 minutes of prog
[5:10:03] <%Cozy90> IT WOULD BE HOT
[5:10:06] <%luftraumm1> that's such a WoW mentality
[5:10:07] <%strakillias> We'd rather see the Gief. Fuck savage
[5:10:08] <%DianaTheAscian> and next thing you know Paige is on Reddit
[5:10:08] <%croxeye> savage definetely isn't the metric of how you engage with the game
[5:10:10] <%Archmortal> you don't even need to run savage to be able to have an opinion on it.  Take fucking Gordias as an example
[5:10:10] <BreakfastSampler> but but but pat I need to see you die to the same thing for 4 hours so I can properly engage
[5:10:11] <%GarbageNirvana> See you decided to have a thing like a family and responsibilities like a sucker
[5:10:14] <ammobasket> I know you play games outside of the streams I just can’t imagine how @.@
[5:10:15] <%SirRazzle> MMOs are way too big to be able to do ALL the content. Especially FF14. The only way you'd do all or even most of the content is if you did nothing but play the game. Which is wack.
[5:10:16] <%croxeye> there is much more to ff14 end game than raiding
[5:10:16] <RushUnplugged> @afronooch I stopped progging and capped all classes and played a ton of Triple Triad so... true

[5:13:44] <pixeldust48> i kinda wanna see elidibus's face, i just know a voice that soothing belongs to a certified hunk

[5:13:56] <%Monkeyweed21> oh they FUCKIN
[5:13:59] <RushUnplugged> Hythlo has introduced SO many to being bi
[5:14:09] <+RelikaNox> Yo Elidibus is hella twink
[5:14:14] <Blank9> @pixeldust48 they showed it
[5:14:27] <Blank9> elidibus is literally just young griffith
[5:14:30] <DrillStopsNoCops> ELIDIBUSSY IS ONLY A WEE BAB
[5:14:50] <T_Sasquatch> man the role quests in this expansion fucking suck so far holy shit
[5:14:52] <+RelikaNox> Elidibus is a young man, not a kid
[5:15:21] <+RelikaNox> I've been liking the caster one
[5:15:26] <+RelikaNox> still gotta finish it but
[5:15:48] <XxMoliciousxX> yeah the caster one was pretty good
[5:15:56] <+ccwettr123> @RelikaNox to be fair, Ancient ideas on what qualifies as 'kid' could be pretty... eccentric considering how long they can live
[5:16:18] <XxMoliciousxX> the phys ranged dps, the last fight was fun. that's about it
[5:16:26] <DrillStopsNoCops> Tank one makes me act up for Kan-E-Senna, which I thought I'd never do. Music choice is awful
[5:16:39] <%Felhad> fuuuuuck, 90002 during the last boss of a Rabanastre roulette
[5:16:41] <+RelikaNox> @ccwettr123 Oh def. Just a lot of times I see people saying he's a little kid when it's just that he was the youngest/most impressionable of the convocation
[5:16:51] <T_Sasquatch> i saw pat play the tank one that was eh, the melee dps one im doing right now and im legit just skipping cutscenes because its that bad, i dont care
[5:16:52] <%G_Thunders> It’s kinda confusing though that Elidibus’ ghost/soul looks small like a kid, but his character model at the end looked like an adult. Or am I wrong
[5:17:58] <+ccwettr123> @G_Thunders you're right, but itll probably be explained, lotta interesting stuff you can do with creation magic
[5:17:58] <+RelikaNox> I think the ghost/soul may be more of a symbolic thing? But we'll see for sure soon enough
[5:18:07] <%Monkeyweed21> @G_Thunders he looked kinda like mask off Unulakhai
[5:18:32] <%G_Thunders> And it just hit me that you can transfer memories from one Elidibus to the next, so it wouldn’t matter anyway
[5:18:33] <+ccwettr123> could also be his memory issues, forgot his adult life
[5:18:35] <Renthur> It could have just been small because of limitations from the crystal tower. He was basically just a projection being made by it.
[5:18:53] <XxMoliciousxX> maybe he was fractured when catboy did the thing, else why was he still there when he was supposedly absorbed
[5:19:10] <Blank9> nah, elidibus is unsundered
[5:19:24] <DrillStopsNoCops> the other members of the convocation look down on him when he talks
[5:19:25] <XxMoliciousxX> when he was abosorbed
[5:19:34] <+ccwettr123> graha said that the aether can take a long time to disperse back into the sea
[5:19:43] <+ccwettr123> from the tower that is
[5:20:07] <%G_Thunders> But Zodiark was sundered even though Elidibus was part of him when it happened, so that could’ve messed him up too
[5:20:21] <Blank9> so what happens when emet's soul just decides to be reborn
[5:20:26] <%JoshManVGH> Made him shrink
[5:20:41] <Blank9> does someone just get to be a full on ascian in modern days with absurd aether powers
[5:20:47] <embra_ashling> anyone else's server just have an oopsie and boot all their friends just now? or just me lmao
[5:20:48] <RushUnplugged> @Blank9 he can't, white auracite'd to death
[5:21:00] <RushUnplugged> I got kicked out too
[5:21:10] <RushUnplugged> last boss of the raid too
[5:21:13] <Blank9> nah, he's definitely in the afterworld
[5:21:25] <%Monkeyweed21> @Blank9 Somewhere in the world a level 80 baby was born
[5:21:31] <embra_ashling> we were 10% off our first clear of zodiark. i just sat there in stunned silence lmfao
[5:21:43] <XxMoliciousxX> it'd be pretty interesting if elidibus send something else back with you that you didn't know about
[5:22:46] <%Felhad> instance servers are fried at the moment @patstaresat
