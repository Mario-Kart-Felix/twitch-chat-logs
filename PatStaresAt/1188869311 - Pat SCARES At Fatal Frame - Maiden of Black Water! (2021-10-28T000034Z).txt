[0:14:46] <@Ranryu692> is Pat/the brb song quieter than usual today, or am I having an issue on my end?

[0:14:51] <+YourRedDog> I just beat Fatal Frame 5 on Wii U the other day since I knew this was coming, I'm curious what it's like on other systems now.

[0:15:38] <mercado94> @yourreddog i heard that they included more costumes but im not sure if they added the original costumes from the wiiu
[0:16:06] <%Ziegsy> bugsnax with hats is the best thing ever

[0:20:49] <+Dakuu75> is this a new game or just a port of an old game?
[0:20:49] <%Undenizen> @cthulu_fearlock thanks, i hate it
[0:20:50] <AMajorTom> HashPat should be the new nomenclature.

[0:28:34] <%SveriSageAdvice> SveriSageAdvice subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 25 months! There's a weird feeling that I got that made me laugh when both you and Woolie mentioned sub messages on the podcast that I sent, it absolutely made my Monday (P.S. Master Chief Collection is STILL busted)
[0:28:45] <%Ziegsy> I wish I could set mine to shout 'PHO-TO'
[0:28:45] <TheHeroAppears> he's nuts
[0:28:46] <%sakeydo> #unblur technology Lol
[0:28:48] <rosemon5001> its actually scary how many creepos still exist trying to take pics even during covid @PatStaresAt
[0:28:50] <%GabeSweetMan> IT'S TOO MUCH
[0:28:59] <%baronblank> yea tim is a madman
[0:29:00] <+dante_must_die_exe> he super got sick real bad
[0:29:01] <%GarbageNirvana> the line between genius and madman is paper thin
[0:29:04] <%hereiam407> Eh, its a living
[0:29:06] <%maskofmichael> Die for you're art man
[0:29:07] <%JoshManVGH> DID YOU SEE HIS HARDDRIVES ON HIS SERVER!?
[0:29:09] <atgithursdays> no he doesnt pat what are you talking about
[0:29:09] <Virokwet> and still working on the review
[0:29:10] <+gustavozxd> idk how he can play all the games read all the books and watch all the movies he does in the time he has
[0:29:11] <@ssjklyco> He got the Covid twice, did he not?
[0:29:12] <%GabeSweetMan> "So I finished my 4532th playthrough..."
[0:29:13] <mudai> I know Tim's work since 2003 when he created the term post-modern video game journalism. He's always been like this
[0:29:14] <TheHappyCynic> Tim wants to burn out. I think he has a starving artist complex
[0:29:17] <%MechArch> he sounds like a manga artist lol
[0:29:17] <%BigCoffee> Remember when the 40 minute DQ11 review was insanely long and cool?
[0:29:19] <%justmildlilac> He basically puts a piece of his soul into each video he makes @patstaresat
[0:29:22] <leinadtonu> The man is unbelievable
[0:29:23] <Virokwet> man deserves a rest
[0:29:29] <%HotSauceFiend> Did i miss the stream?
[0:29:33] <+KaguraRaion> @Monkeyweed21 Im from NY but never had it up there wouldn't have known that
[0:29:35] <+chiazam> HE PLAYED SO MANY GAMES FOR THIS REVIEW WHAT THE FUCK
[0:29:36] <%vivaldiva> he does the math in part 3 i think, during a rant about almost dying, again
[0:29:37] <%JoshManVGH> Like 24tb of content captured for this video
[0:29:41] <%sakeydo> live in a way worth dying for!
[0:29:42] <%hereiam407> He say he wasn't taking a vacation, but that he was taking a break
[0:29:43] <%maskofmichael> Self-Imposed Crunch
[0:29:44] <%vivaldiva> 107h/week or something on average
[0:29:44] <iswearimjustdandy> I dont want him to die by mangaka heart attack
[0:29:45] <%chance_h> Tim did the math himself in the video, all for cyberpunk 2077
[0:29:47] <SaltyAzteca> Ive only watched this one, but I can tell that that man is DEDICATED to teh craft. Which is why im fucking scared of him and greatly respect him
[0:29:50] <%SWFanatic> Pat: Become Orb
[0:29:56] <%the_Punktuation> Did you see his latest tweet about his hardrive space?

[0:31:27] <%chance_h> Pat's Pregatanate?
[0:31:30] <@Ranryu692> trick or treating in the burbs must be so different from doing it in an apartment building
[0:31:31] <%maskofmichael> @FunkyStreams Yeah, Zangief, Elmo, and Paige

[0:31:42] <%linSP> full sized candy bars? That’s  NUTS
[0:31:42] <ryderbootz> when I was a boy there was a house on my street that gave out cans of soda
[0:31:44] <+dante_must_die_exe> fuckoff candy corn
[0:31:45] <%goblincat__> cactus_gato subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 22 months! oh uh happy 22 months here's a weird fun fact for the day apparently humans are the only species that enjoy spicy foods that's it, happy halloween yay

[0:31:54] <%chance_h> Candy Corn is good till you hit the double digits
[0:31:54] <+Ardailec> Candy corn is popular because it's cheap. Good, but cheap
[0:31:54] <%doctordinkus> smart kids go trick or treating in rich ass neighborhoods
[0:31:55] <+ThomasOfTroy> I would go to the bougie neighborhoods with my friends to get actual full boxes of Little Debbie stuff
[0:31:55] <SaltyAzteca> Is that really just a corn candy
[0:31:56] <%ScreamLord> Candy Corn is fucking wretched.

[0:32:39] <Littlecjmajor> its so common here i hate it, one neighbor strictly gave it out and would get annoyed that no one would come to her house
[0:32:40] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> M&Ms are better than Smarties though
[0:32:40] <%BigCoffee> I save my brown ones for last
[0:32:41] <%linSP> smarties are fruity chalk here
[0:32:42] <%PocketBearIllustrator> I've never tried Twinkies, but knowing they're filled with sugar, I can imagine them tasting awful.
[0:32:42] <%bear_breaker20> @Ranryu692 Low.Tier.
[0:32:43] <+RyTYoung> YEAH IN THE UK

[0:32:52] <%JoshManVGH> Don't they all taste the same?
[0:32:53] <%maskofmichael> Why is chalk used for so many candies?
[0:32:57] <%GabeSweetMan> It's true
[0:32:58] <nolanmanly> Did anyone else ever crush and snort those?
[0:32:59] <%greasypete00> @SharkMissile sorry to hear about the loss of your taste
[0:33:00] <%tank7013> Man I would take candy corn over american smarties any day

[0:36:30] <%Seyren1986> I just got warrior up to 80. I did MCH before that. I need a healer now
[0:36:31] <@Ranryu692> @PeachSaliva I saw a drawing of the Invisible Woman today where she had made everything but her skeleton invisible and I thought of you
[0:36:33] <tomo_vendor> @SilverFaustX poki owns evo now
[0:36:39] <Yakobro> babylon 5 is a great 4 season show
[0:36:40] <tanarath> Pat should check out Lexx
[0:36:42] <SilverFaustX> what
[0:36:42] <%BigCoffee> Did you also enjoy Stargate Atlantis ?
[0:36:43] <%Buzzard42> Yeah but do you love the last two seasons
[0:36:44] <ryderbootz> @SilverFaustX she owns Evo
[0:36:45] <AllenDeadman> btw you saw the new star ocean pat>
[0:36:47] <%SWFanatic> <3 Elmo
[0:36:47] <%JoshManVGH> What about Farscape!?
[0:36:47] <Tracazoid> What about Atlantis?
[0:36:48] <%Frost_Quill> I love that the SG-1 movie and the animated Atlantis: Lost Empire movie start the EXACT same way.
[0:36:50] <%FunkyStreams> till they swapped out the lead actor.
[0:36:51] <%chance_h> BTW if you main healer, your kill count will always matter more than the dps or tank psaLiz
[0:36:52] <%MechArch> boomer pat
[0:36:54] <%BigCoffee> :(
[0:36:54] <SilverFaustX> :s
[0:36:54] <%hereiam407> What about the movie?
[0:36:55] <%tank7013> @SilverFaustX Yea
[0:36:58] <%Buzzard42> HUH ok
[0:37:03] <%vaporousTippler> Fuck all that. Fire up the Lexx.
[0:37:07] <%BigCoffee> stargate universe was extra shit right ?
[0:37:15] <%Ziegsy> why do animals like being patted like drums? its weird
[0:37:17] <%hereiam407> Atlantis
[0:37:17] <+セビー> Lexx is… something
[0:37:20] <KaitlynnHere> !uptime
[0:37:20] <+chiazam> Fuck Atlantis
[0:37:20] <@Moobot> @KaitlynnHere I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 37m 30s.
[0:37:21] <%Deekman> Atlantis got better as it went
[0:37:23] <AllenDeadman> SPINOFF
[0:37:24] <%bravebravesrobin> FUCK THATS SO ACCURATE
[0:37:24] <%JoshManVGH> I think Peach would love Farscape, because Jim Henson aliens!
[0:37:29] <+ThomasOfTroy> Did you watch Universe pat?
[0:37:30] <KaitlynnHere> Oh good
[0:37:31] <%Buzzard42> @セビー Lexx is a masterpiece
[0:37:32] <SaltyAzteca> SG1 had McGuyver, that was really cool
[0:37:33] <%Deekman> Lexx ducking rules up to season 3
[0:37:36] <SilverFaustX> babylon 5 is the best
[0:37:37] <%maskofmichael> SG-1 is 24 years old
[0:37:39] <KaitlynnHere> Elmo is a spin off
[0:37:41] <%Frost_Quill> "Look everybody it's Superman!  We can't show him though..." - Supergirl character.
[0:37:45] <Rellim80> Farscape is amazing
[0:37:45] <iswearimjustdandy> Cast is hotter in atlantis though, im torn
[0:37:52] <nolanmanly> How else am I supposed to get immersed
[0:37:55] <3viltiki> I bet Paige likes the candy corn because it is poison
[0:37:58] <%bravebravesrobin> I actually liked Universe
[0:38:02] <%FunkyStreams> woops
[0:38:10] <Yakobro> monkaS
[0:38:12] <%BigCoffee> @3viltiki sounds right
[0:38:13] <%SharkMissile> Omegalul
[0:38:13] <%FunkyStreams> *insert coins*

[0:38:26] <%FunkyStreams> word limit exceeded
[0:38:28] <%doctordinkus> says what we're all thinking
[0:38:28] <KaitlynnHere> That was the end
[0:38:29] <%JoshManVGH> @bravebravesrobin Universe had potential.
[0:38:31] <DomunDomunDomun> @BigCoffee It was getting good later, but not enough to save it.
[0:38:33] <$Futurecity10> @PatStaresAt Atlantis sucks but Aquaman though
[0:38:35] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Need more quaters

[0:39:35] <johnatella> -butt rock singing echoes in the distance-
[0:39:36] <%chance_h> Disturbed is a solid C band. You throw them in your playlist just so you know that the rest of your playlist is better
[0:39:36] <topiodonk> you like the domestical violence solo?
[0:39:39] <%ScreamLord> Indestructible is godly
[0:39:39] <%cooldude69xx> That whole band is my biggest guilty pleasure in music
[0:39:40] <%SuckerPunchSyd> I love the remixes people do of it

[0:39:45] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Like the mario 64 one
[0:39:48] <%doctordinkus> the spoken part near the end is turbocringe
[0:39:52] <+RemedyofRevenge> Down with the sickness is the ONE time a radio edit is better than the original song, since it cuts out the cringey role-play kid mom bit

[0:47:23] <+unhuggable1> hes pretending to poop
[0:47:30] <+Dakuu75> See chat, he doesn't trust us to be alone. He has to baby sit us, even now.
[0:47:30] <+D00msDayDan> either he's pooping or geef's pooping
[0:47:43] <%athuramn> I never thought about it like that @saadi90
[0:47:44] <@Ranryu692> I feel like recording in the bathroom would be too echo-y
[0:47:51] <ExpressNode> Pat Poops At
[0:47:54] <%athuramn> I wish I was paid to poop
[0:47:55] <VirtuaRailith> they poop together looking each other in the eye for moral support
[0:48:05] <%SWFanatic> Canada has bathrooms? I thought they just used trees
[0:48:06] <%THATGUY_789> Gief Cake 5000
[0:48:10] <%HotSauceFiend> I found a manga called my daughter became a  skeleton and it was wierd
[0:48:11] <%Ziegsy> i really hope the soup have given him the trotts. he might get the jump scared nd poop himself
[0:48:15] <%SWFanatic> Thats why their flag has a maple leaf
[0:48:19] <Rellim80> We'll know who was pooping based on if his hair's wet and if he's wearing the same clothes.
[0:48:21] <%athuramn> @swfanatic igloos, friend
[0:48:43] <%SWFanatic> Thats north of the wall

[0:49:19] <%THATGUY_789> the real question is Pat a folder or a scruncher?
[0:49:28] <%athuramn> Canada's more like a bottom
[0:49:44] <@Ranryu692> Pat probably wipes with the whole roll
[0:49:45] <%SWFanatic> But its up north
[0:49:49] <+Dakuu75> I always put my phone in a ziplock bag and take it with me to the shower
[0:49:51] <KaitlynnHere> Gotta wash off the poop germs because the toilet paper lies
[0:49:53] <s1rcuit> @THATGUY_789 pretty sure he answered that years ago
[0:49:56] <ExpressNode> Fold mine like dinner napkins
[0:49:56] <Rellim80> Does Pat stand to wipe? Do yooou?
[0:49:57] <%athuramn> it's a geographic paradox

[0:51:03] <Rellim80> @iswearimjustdandy So you stand when you poop?
[0:51:11] <%SWFanatic> You gotta know when to hold'em and when to fold'em
[0:51:12] <Ombrebird> he dropped the roll in again I bet
[0:51:15] <+Dakuu75> I use to love 100 Grand chocolate bars when I was a kid but, it's too much caramel
[0:51:17] <+ProfessorMorrigan> some say he is still shitting to this day

[0:54:31] <ExpressNode> But do we though?
[0:54:31] <%GarbageNirvana> I mean I've known some dogs who'll eat the hell outta spicy food
[0:54:32] <%HotSauceFiend> Humans are the only species that "enjoy" food
[0:54:33] <deviljhojho_> can dogs taste spicy food? i fucked up my arm trying to prevent my dog from eating salsa
[0:54:34] <%notsoy> animals that eat spicy shit have no ability to taste it, usually
[0:54:36] <%GabeSweetMan> YEAAAAH
[0:54:38] <altruistichat> that's the psych degree speaking
[0:54:39] <%big_boss_baby> We also enjoy alcohol, which is literally just weak poison
[0:54:41] <thelonechris> We're masochists
[0:54:41] <Gorgs7> We're also one of only 3 animals that gain pleasure from sex
[0:54:41] <%GarbageNirvana> But like some dogs eat anything anyway

[0:55:00] <%maskofmichael> Smooth all the way
[0:55:06] <%GabeSweetMan> What about tater skins being in them?
[0:55:06] <KaitlynnHere> @big_boss_baby not unless you drink a lot
[0:55:08] <+Dakuu75> I like mashed potatoes with bits of potatoe skin
[0:55:08] <%Ziegsy> @remedyofrevenge did it make that 'Bwoop' noise with each shuffle?
[0:55:12] <%GabeSweetMan> I like having the skins being included.
[0:55:12] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> Lumpy mashed potatos are just failed mashed potatoes
[0:55:13] <%IamGrapes> good point
[0:55:13] <ExpressNode> Lumpy are good with gravy. Smooth if I don't want anything on it
[0:55:14] <+KaguraRaion> Lumpy is kool i just hate when theres skin in it
[0:55:17] <thelonechris> I like the potato chunks
[0:55:17] <%THATGUY_789> always add some sour cream

[0:55:23] <%SWFanatic> Hi Elmo
[0:55:24] <%AmuserName> Lumpy, skin-in is the best. Sour cream instead of milk.
[0:55:29] <%GabeSweetMan> Sour cream or butter?
[0:55:32] <+pectusumbra> I mean southern/homestyle is fine, but smooth is generally better
[0:55:32] <altruistichat> YO ELMO
[0:55:36] <%greasypete00> i had a piece of celophane in some mashed potatoes from a restaurant once and i was mad
[0:55:38] <DracaenaLeaf> moldy mashed potatoes are the worst tho
[0:55:40] <%AyotoCorp> I hear gief
[0:55:41] <+RemedyofRevenge> @Ziegsy it makes that rubbing noise rubber does on a balloon
[0:55:45] <SilverFaustX> tree shrews and birds eat spicy foods
[0:55:46] <iswearimjustdandy> Best with buttermilk
[0:55:49] <%athuramn> does elmo jump with ease
[0:55:49] <%big_boss_baby> @KaitlynnHere It's still poison, we're just only drinking enough to just barely impair ourselves
[0:55:50] <%MightyDuckShoes> Smooth mashed potatoes are gross to me. The powdered crap ruined smooth for me.
[0:55:56] <%IamGrapes> i had an ex that wouldn't make her mashed potatos lumpy and when i tried to make them smoother, she'd get upset at me. not in a crazy way, tho, just in a way that people get with food
[0:55:57] <%SveriSageAdvice> aw i dont think i hear him

[1:01:11] <+Hieronymous_Flex> Absolutely
[1:01:12] <Endguard> ye
[1:01:12] <Ozavic> Oh that's a fucking PS2 game
[1:01:12] <KaitlynnHere> I’m so scared my boobs fell out of this single piece of cloth

[1:01:18] <hearingthenseeing> oh yeah
[1:01:18] <AvroEltz> Its the ps2 enegy
[1:01:19] <%SWFanatic> The lazy susan of fate is turning
[1:01:19] <akitanito> it screams of ps2 game
[1:01:20] <@Ranryu692> if it isn't a PS2 game it was certainly built on top of one
[1:01:21] <Gorgs7> yup various hammer noises, this checks out
[1:01:22] <%drabberfaun535> Ps2 or early Wii
[1:01:23] <gespenstkick> DMC 123 flashbacks
[1:01:24] <%StoopKid241> Holy shit yeah. You just unlocked a memory for me Pat
[1:01:24] <SaltyAzteca> I can taste the PS2 games

[1:01:26] <sparklinghallow> love the menu sounds
[1:01:28] <altruistichat> those sound effects with the ps5 controller is a bit surreal
[1:01:30] <%GabeSweetMan> PS2 sound design, mmmmm
[1:01:30] <%ZephynM> This is PS2 as fuck.
[1:01:34] <rasamune> Oh yeah that's A Shadow-Tower-Abyss-ass Tale-of-the-Forsaken-Land ass select noise
[1:01:36] <Saltmeisterr> no its a wiiu game :)
[1:01:40] <iswearimjustdandy> takes me right back to soul caliber
[1:01:40] <%athuramn> the first flash is a precursor to hearing "resident eeeevilll..."
[1:01:41] <marklarphd> I heard this was a wii game
[1:01:43] <+Dakuu75> @PatStaresAt this feels like something you played for a shit-storm or some other October, eh?
[1:01:45] <%YakumoYomi> Loud ass menu sound effects and "clunky" cursor movements
[1:01:49] <%GabeSweetMan> Remember The Ring 2 and that fucking SPLAT stock sfx?
[1:01:51] <+RenoDeGeneric> Wait you leave the HD vibrations on
[1:01:58] <Ranger747> ye
[1:01:58] <Tracazoid> So PS2 they don't even have mouse support
[1:02:01] <+pectusumbra> Yeah they did, that's how I know about it
[1:02:05] <thelonechris> Yeah FeelsBadMan
[1:02:05] <%HairballCT> did this game even get an english dub? i forget
[1:02:07] <commanderapathy> 4I have never found fatal frame scary
[1:02:07] <KaitlynnHere> So loud clanging
[1:02:12] <+Dakuu75> Neat.
[1:02:12] <Tracazoid> So Pat did you ever play through 4, the Japan only one with the fan patch?
[1:02:14] <+セビー> splat sfx is top tier
[1:02:21] <+ProfessorMorrigan> shitstorms FeelsStrongMan
[1:02:25] <akitanito> I can barely see this
[1:02:26] <%SWFanatic> Maiden of Blackwater sounds like a Pirates of the Caribbean spinoff
[1:02:31] <akitanito> perfectly calibrated
[1:02:32] <%GabeSweetMan> That's awful
[1:02:33] <altruistichat> why would you make the thing you're measuirng against hard to see
[1:02:34] <RyuuAoi> Thank you for the night of shit tonight, Pat!
[1:02:35] <+Dakuu75> Brightness indicators are ALWAYS A FUCKING LIE
[1:02:39] <KaitlynnHere> Ooooooo
[1:02:41] <AllenDeadman> yeah
[1:02:42] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> It's YouTube thumbnail with the arrow lol
[1:02:44] <+Bredirish123> Pat, what is your greatest irrational fear?
[1:02:46] <ToneBacas> cognitive bias or something like that
[1:02:47] <%baka_sugoi> I remember these SFX LUL
[1:02:48] <akitanito> just go max
[1:02:49] <%StoopKid241> I can't at all
[1:02:51] <Visorak6> Do like 50%?
[1:02:52] <%chance_h> all i see is the arrow
[1:02:52] <%THATGUY_789> if you squint hard enough
[1:02:55] <AntifaCatboy> I usually just leave it at default
[1:02:56] <%Agami23> always 2 up from default
[1:03:02] <+pectusumbra> Also Pat are you playing this on PS5? would you want to try out the super rumble or whatever?
[1:03:02] <thelonechris> "Hey, this shit is fake."
[1:03:11] <%maskofmichael> Play it in black darkness coward
[1:03:14] <RyuuAoi> Pat, what is your biggest fear?
[1:03:14] <+YourRedDog> The ghosts in this work of fiction have no relation to real ghosts
[1:03:14] <LVL1_Scumbag> You mean cameras don't actually defeat ghosts?
[1:03:14] <%baka_sugoi> 2 sp00ky 4 MEEE NotLikeThis
[1:03:16] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> I love that movie.
[1:03:16] <%Kevlar_Caviar> i love that movie!
[1:03:18] <DomunDomunDomun> @Dakuu75 I've seen ONE that was actually legit, I think it was Doom2016
[1:03:21] <KaitlynnHere> I hope the game is louder than these sfx cause holy shit
[1:03:23] <rasamune> "This is a work of fiction; if you think you're in this, you're wrong"
[1:03:30] <+セビー> i like seeing what im doing so i crank up brightness too high
[1:03:36] <dwhanson> wow twitch compression is doing wonders for the atmosphere of this game.
[1:03:40] <Visorak6> Is this a scary game or like ha ha jumpscares
[1:03:40] <%chance_h> Japan isn't real. An island nation that's addicted to 2d waifus is too absurd
[1:03:42] <%majorpeppy> oh that's hair, girl
[1:03:50] <Saltmeisterr> MIU
[1:03:54] <+Dakuu75> @DomunDomunDomun I remember that one. that one was good.
[1:03:56] <RyuuAoi> Sadako?
[1:04:02] <%THATGUY_789> I wonder how many Kodak Moments we'll see
[1:04:07] <%shurtal> the spider?

[1:04:17] <%Ziegsy> i cant see shit
[1:04:18] <AllenDeadman> no
[1:04:20] <+pectusumbra> Resident Evil 6 is beyond belief
[1:04:22] <%afronooch> as one does
[1:04:23] <%chance_h> moist
[1:04:24] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> easy mistake to make
[1:04:24] <rasamune> Adjust brightness until the bent-over man is visible and the giraffe is invisible
[1:04:24] <%baka_sugoi> WAIFU woolieGASM
[1:04:26] <+Dakuu75> fucking 3 seconds in and we get a wet t-shirt contest

[1:04:38] <RyuuAoi> Everyone should own a copy of RE6 by now.
[1:04:43] <akitanito> the wrong kind of scare boner
[1:04:44] <Pyon84> This seems TOO dark
[1:04:45] <KaitlynnHere> We are now best friends
[1:04:46] <%vivaldiva> zoneSweat
[1:04:48] <lehvak182> Looks a bit too dark
[1:04:49] <%baka_sugoi> so dark
[1:04:50] <+Dakuu75> Jokes on her, that's not water, it's ghost jizz
[1:04:53] <nolanmanly> Just wet enough for terror
[1:04:54] <+YourRedDog> They made her an idol/actress, but it has little to no effect on the story except to dress her up this way and get wet.
[1:04:55] <marvel877> It aint a Tecmo game without some girl covered in shiny liquid.
[1:04:57] <+toastedalmond1222> RE6 is one of the only games that legit made me nauseous when i played
[1:04:59] <godzookylives> crazy that she's in SmashUltimate

[1:08:36] <+yoscribe> yo how's the port
[1:08:36] <+YourRedDog> It's not a new Fatal Frame, it's a re-release of the Wii U game for Playstation
[1:08:37] <Mottyrob> Fatal case of Cutscene Dryness
[1:08:37] <Visorak6> THE SLUUUUDDGGGEEE

[1:08:45] <%GabeSweetMan> Good ol' hair water.
[1:08:45] <%YakumoYomi> @BinaryFireball It was on Wii U, and got ported to modern platforms
[1:08:46] <$Cooksey89> Cutscene the game
[1:08:47] <%HotSauceFiend> oh its sludge
[1:08:47] <%vivaldiva> not for long she ain't
[1:08:49] <%tank7013> Cutscene fear is less sexy than ingame fear so she dries out
[1:08:50] <%BakiinPlaysStuff> Oh no it's that deadly Japanese ghost hair!
[1:08:53] <KaitlynnHere> @chiazam old game, new international releases though
[1:09:02] <Polyceramic> look at that raw sewage
[1:09:03] <Fenlig> British Petroleum was here
[1:09:08] <%HairballCT> @DomunDomunDomun if ben sharpie was nearby this environment would be bone dry
[1:09:12] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Do all ghosts have bodacious chests in japan, or is it just this game?
[1:09:14] <ExpressNode> Why was this a Wii U exclusive again?
[1:09:16] <%SWFanatic> Deadly Premonition: Wet T-Shirt Boob Sewer Vacation
[1:09:16] <Polyceramic> what is this the tory government
[1:09:27] <%GabeSweetMan> It doesn't like it.
[1:09:27] <%athuramn> nothing good
[1:09:28] <akitanito> it's okay
[1:09:32] <+Dakuu75> the water sounded ok... it's the fucking Tinitus that's killing us
[1:09:37] <bigboy3d> It's actually not that bad, for me at least
[1:09:39] <$Cooksey89> Never stop backing down
[1:09:39] <%baka_sugoi> thigh highs too woolieGASM bruh LUL
[1:09:41] <%ZephynM> @AlteisenReiseZ I feel like their bodacious chests are more modest than some Japanese ghosts.
[1:09:43] <%polothegreatest> camera controls
[1:09:43] <%Dapper_Cactuar> @ExpressNode due to 4 Nintendo had partial ownership of the IP
[1:09:44] <3viltiki> so I'm going to proceed with the assumption that this game has the same plot as Pirates of Blackwater
[1:09:44] <%sakeydo> The ultimate in lesbian game play? Vibrating controls and scare titties. Lol
[1:09:45] <%hereiam407> Wamp
[1:09:47] <RyuuAoi> @expressnode For the Metroid
[1:09:49] <+Dumb_Parrot> WiiU controller as a camera seemed like an obvious choice, really
[1:09:50] <godzookylives> what is he playing it on?
[1:09:50] <KaitlynnHere> Yea the ghost sounds are deafening
[1:09:52] <Ranger747> its the Dibik Box
[1:09:52] <nolanmanly> Surely these bazongas are the devils work
[1:09:57] <%Backfire_Shot> Question for chat/pat is the epic game store still for real the worst to do anything with i want to play Darkest dungeon 2
[1:09:59] <+pectusumbra> not for nothing, this aesthetic of the water and the horrible ghost hair is pretty rad though
[1:09:59] <Admiral_PopnFresh> ew hair

[1:11:41] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> why isn't the T is Fatal Frame capitalized-ohhhhhh
[1:11:41] <%SharkMissile> I'm hungry
[1:11:42] <thelonechris> Rolling in the Deep
[1:11:42] <+Dumb_Parrot> Trophies always make me scared
[1:11:43] <Bonebagmel> The boobies were calming
[1:11:44] <nolanmanly> “Personally I am scared of mommy milkers” -some writer probably
[1:11:44] <deviljhojho_> who
[1:11:45] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> I'm edging as we speak
[1:11:45] <LVL1_Scumbag> Spooba
[1:11:45] <%GabeSweetMan> I do appreciate that if you've played the prior games, MC's carry over.
[1:11:46] <AngryAsian5> I'm lovin how jank this is so far. LUL
[1:11:46] <%YakumoYomi> Nah, those ghosts are too hot to be terrifying
[1:11:46] <%chance_h> Play testers were found to be either Horny or scared... So we decided to make this game hornier to push sales
[1:11:47] <topiodonk> completely
[1:11:47] <Parapattern> Hasn't this game series always been horny?
[1:11:48] <+chiazam> Ghost Tits?
[1:11:48] <+Dakuu75> YEAAAAAHHH~!!
[1:11:50] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> on my seat that is

[1:12:08] <RyuuAoi> Fat tits are the spookiest! I have night,ares of Hitomi Tanaka smothering me to death
[1:12:09] <%Dapper_Cactuar> 3 had a good prologue
[1:12:11] <+Dakuu75> the SCARIEST thing ever... WORDS~!
[1:12:11] <Saltmeisterr> Horrified
[1:12:23] <Saltmeisterr> paralyzied with fear
[1:12:25] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> 4spooky7me
[1:12:27] <KaitlynnHere> no it’s spooky text
[1:12:32] <%tank7013> @Parapattern The player characters sure but I don't remember the ghosts being so horny so often
[1:12:36] <%SWFanatic> Ahsoka?
[1:12:36] <$Cooksey89> This game is differently scaring me
[1:12:36] <%hereiam407> I'm Hornified
[1:12:41] <%HotSauceFiend> shadow reading sounds like reading between the lines
[1:12:42] <%The_Protagonist> wait but Fatal Frame 4 didn't get localized :V
[1:12:43] <%sakeydo> Would you fuck a ghost? Lol
[1:12:44] <Ranger747> It gives me the same vibes as that Cursed Mountain on Wii
[1:12:46] <KaitlynnHere> Tell with text, don’t show
[1:12:46] <%baka_sugoi> remaster's
[1:12:46] <+YourRedDog> Yeah, this is a weakness of the game, all the chapters are broken up with text dumps. It feels like they ran out of time/money to animate scenes.
[1:12:48] <+Dakuu75> I can't believe some of this shit we put up with in the early 2000's for games
[1:12:51] <%Anime_Flux> look at this Dead or Alive character right here...
[1:12:53] <+xbalmorax> I've been wanting a remaster of 2 for FOREVER
[1:12:55] <akitanito> that shirt aint wet
[1:12:56] <RayShadow278> I beat 1 recently and man, that game spooked me a lot harder than I expected
[1:12:56] <deviljhojho_> Pathetic
[1:12:57] <%Dapper_Cactuar> the first 3 Fatal Frame games are all pretty solid
[1:12:57] <dynamitedoki> 3 Is one of my favorite games. I would love an orginal trilogy remaster
[1:12:58] <%SWFanatic> Silent Hill, you said we'd go back there someday, but you never did
[1:12:59] <sauceboss310> sugoiAwawa sugoiAwawa
[1:13:01] <%baka_sugoi> oh no
[1:13:01] <iswearimjustdandy> Sounds like that fake pop team epic episode
[1:13:03] <%hereiam407> My face is tired
[1:13:04] <%polothegreatest> the gods of olympus have abandon me
[1:13:06] <KaitlynnHere> But I’m scared to death!
[1:13:07] <%Dapper_Cactuar> 2 and 3 are my favorites
[1:13:09] <%FunkyStreams> cant even, try, to cry.
[1:13:12] <%maskofmichael> Evangelion?

[1:13:18] <RyuuAoi> This is basically Silent Hill
[1:13:18] <KaitlynnHere> Bada da bum
[1:13:20] <sauceboss310> aren't we all
[1:13:24] <+xbalmorax> The xbox version of Fatal Frame 2 lets you play the whole game in first person
[1:13:26] <%hereiam407> Mmmm yuri

[1:13:39] <%Dr_Mooose> jesus
[1:13:40] <sauceboss310> sugoiYu sugoiRi
[1:13:41] <+YourRedDog> 1 is probably the scariest, 2 is the better game, 3 is ok.

[1:14:32] <%Faustgesicht> Where's the fat midwestern guy?
[1:14:33] <+JonathLP> ghost mommy?

[1:14:47] <+KaguraRaion> Is JP audio an option?
[1:14:48] <+Hieronymous_Flex> Surely cosplay outfits are the most practical attire for running around in dingy abandoned buildings
[1:14:49] <+BoocherOnTwitch> Really? Because I wouldn't be caught DEAD wearing that top!
[1:14:50] <Kingjoker310> maybe the lip sync is ment for japanese

[1:29:19] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> ghosts hate bad selfies the most
[1:29:19] <p3niletrauma> So based on this concept, does this mean just tossing a flash grenade or strobing some lights will defeat ghosts too?

[1:31:39] <%Agami23> wide ghosts maybe?
[1:31:41] <+Fep3> becayse you need different angles

[1:33:14] <%FunkyStreams> she's not afraid of any particular kind of ghost.
[1:33:17] <%baka_sugoi> IT'S NOT A PHASE
[1:33:21] <%Saadi90> The budget was spent on the Booba
[1:33:27] <Zaphire_Saucypants> because people have a weird fetish for porcelain dolls?
[1:33:29] <+Dakuu75> sure love this 10 FPS CS
[1:33:30] <%ZephynM> Kid reminds me of Kuro-sama from Sekiro.

[1:38:44] <ExpressNode> These lack of facial expressions is really starting to seem apparent

[1:39:18] <Zaphire_Saucypants> we all know tits are the true eyes of a woman's soul. Dat's where the expressions happen.
[1:39:22] <%MechArch> when are they just releasing fatal frame paradise?
[1:39:22] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> I want a horror story to just give a various evil name. Like Mount Evil, or Doom Forest.

[1:39:57] <%hereiam407> I hope every door is that slow
[1:39:57] <%Garthunox> i feel like fatal frame games need to have bad voice acting
[1:39:59] <Zaphire_Saucypants> So many clocks, so little time.
[1:40:03] <%Garthunox> its like, a rule

[1:40:45] <%bear_breaker20> tails get Framed
[1:40:48] <SaltyAzteca> Always an evil cult
[1:40:50] <%hereiam407> Another evil cult huh

[1:41:00] <%KineticZen> Death Mountain? Hope we get to photograph some Octorocks
[1:41:01] <slimslimjim88> These must be what all the mind goblins look like
[1:41:07] <BooitsDock> its bad ass
[1:41:12] <BooitsDock> do a flip
[1:41:22] <%hereiam407> Why are evil cults always haunted, you'd think they'd get ahead df that shit being the experts and all
[1:41:23] <Jaller101514> ritual suicide is not a good business plan for a cult...
[1:41:25] <%chance_h> Neither world beans on suicide mountain
[1:41:26] <VritraReiRei> @Saltmeisterr i havent played this one but i really like the first 3. 4th one is kinda weird because of Wii controls
[1:41:27] <SPidERMan8576> That outfit
[1:41:29] <Saltmeisterr> pat is super engaged
[1:41:34] <ape_hawk> dont text and stream, pat
[1:41:38] <ape_hawk> youll get pulled over
[1:41:39] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> she's opening her ow house's doors the same way as spooky doors, very fantastic
[1:41:52] <%SWFanatic> What a rebel
[1:41:55] <%hereiam407> Nice
[1:41:56] <%Buzzard42> hey this game kicks ass
[1:41:57] <%MechArch> they are
[1:41:58] <Jaller101514> full cult group suicide on the other hand...
[1:41:58] <%hereiam407> Nice clip
[1:42:00] <placeholder03> I do that too
[1:42:01] <@Ranryu692> hawt
[1:42:01] <%FunkyStreams> lol
[1:42:01] <Pyon84> Spooky clipping
[1:42:04] <%YakumoYomi> Maybe they become spooky ghost doors later?
[1:42:07] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> Would Skelmo fight off any invading ghosts?
[1:42:16] <rasamune> [to the tune of Bustin'] freaky ghost doors
[1:42:16] <InvincibleIcarus> steal her look
[1:42:18] <%hereiam407> My god the door animation is slowww
[1:42:27] <%FunkyStreams> I figure this is custom in a japanese household?
[1:42:27] <jowi_time> well, if your house was filled with ghosts, every door would be a spooky ghost door
[1:42:27] <%Lizard0TM> careful not to clip into her shirt
[1:42:29] <studleydoorite> tbf this is how I walk around the house sometimes when I'm feeling really out of it
[1:42:32] <%DXLelouch24> Skelmo would join and become their leader
[1:42:35] <%The_Protagonist> probably means at some point this will become haunted also
[1:42:40] <jae_ordinary> a troubled woman just went off to the suicide mountain lets try to walk a lil faster yuri
[1:42:41] <%tank7013> I like to think that she's acting like this because Hisoka will just hide behind doors to scare her
[1:42:49] <SPidERMan8576> Watch out for upskirt bursts
[1:42:51] <p3niletrauma> Since she opens doors the same way in  her house as in ghostville, I wonder if Leon kicks the shit out of the doors in his house
[1:42:51] <%DXLelouch24> because Skelmo is Papyrus
[1:42:52] <%hereiam407> Whoa, slow down honey
[1:42:59] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> @DXLelouch24 How could he betray his family?
[1:43:06] <%SWFanatic> Terrifying door opening action
[1:43:07] <%chance_h> @tank7013 is she Kris from Deltarune?
[1:43:10] <%hereiam407> She moves any faster, a door will explode
[1:43:12] <+YourRedDog> Or you could open the map
[1:43:14] <Mottyrob> Is she trying to insert a barbershop/Jazz bit into her jog?
[1:43:15] <%Buzzard42> what's with that run animation
[1:43:17] <%SWFanatic> booga booga the booba booba

[1:43:23] <studleydoorite> @p3niletrauma LUL
[1:43:36] <%FunkyStreams> Is Japan always in sepia?
[1:43:48] <%tank7013> @chance_h I wouldn't know
[1:43:48] <%Ipsenscastle> Just got here, Pat goblinned out and watched all six Tim Rogers videos didn't he?
[1:43:55] <p3niletrauma> No. Only the past is in sepia. Duh.
[1:43:58] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> No
[1:44:03] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> 2 and 4 I believe
[1:44:07] <%Zaneofthedead> @FunkyStreams since the bombs yes
[1:44:08] <%hereiam407> @Ipsenscastle no, just the way Tim asked
[1:44:11] <%FunkyStreams> @Buzzard42 kinda seems like shes urgently trying to fins a bathroom.

[1:44:28] <@Ranryu692> it's like a before and after photo
[1:44:30] <%Buzzard42> incredible
[1:44:33] <%TheLemuroid> I'm more impressed that there even is a reflection
[1:44:33] <%ZephynM> It's a ghost mirror showing how she looked in the past. Kappa
[1:44:37] <Sypheck> it's just a low res mirror Kappa
[1:44:40] <%Buzzard42> mirrors are just windows into the Wii U Dimension
[1:44:42] <Ranger747> thats what the ghosdt dimension is like
[1:44:52] <%hereiam407> A smile crazy
[1:44:54] <%SWFanatic> the Yamata mk II?
[1:44:55] <$floralkami> i kinda like it, tho
[1:44:56] <%ElkRiverDog> They say mirrors reflect the soul
[1:44:59] <%baka_sugoi> crossover LUL
[1:45:02] <%tank7013> "They seem like good friends"
[1:45:05] <akitanito> Just get Kiryu to punch some ghost
[1:45:07] <SPidERMan8576> Windows is actually the wii u controller
[1:45:11] <@goose_attack_almanac> Reminder that fatal frame 4 has a Zero Suit costume just to give the character more noticable butt physics
[1:45:13] <%hereiam407> Twin peaks
[1:45:19] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> oh boy I just googled the outfits for this game. very spooky
[1:45:19] <%FunkyStreams> @Zaneofthedead  I figure it would have more a greenish glow
[1:45:24] <%baka_sugoi> too DIE
[1:45:24] <+YourRedDog> So apparently living next to the Suicide Mountain makes the local teenagers emotionless androids.
[1:45:27] <MyNameIsRasus> It's the Logan Paul mountain

[1:46:10] <%hereiam407> This game seems kind of niche
[1:46:10] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> @SWFanatic Be careful with that name. You might summon Minh to haunt Pat's home.
[1:46:20] <%ZephynM> What if she turns into a Stefano and her camera is actually her EYE
[1:46:37] <%JoshManVGH> No longer  Fatal Frame, now Anime Waifu Alan Wake
[1:46:38] <vance168> can't fight ghost if you aint cute- Dan Akroyd
[1:46:40] <%hereiam407> When Evil Within 3
[1:46:57] <%FunkyStreams> its a shame this survival horror protagonist never learned to run properly.
[1:47:14] <%FunkyStreams> the odds are really stacked against her. Like Paige.
[1:47:14] <%Bluwizard21> she runs like she's never run in her life
[1:47:14] <%hereiam407> She's going to break an ankle in those high heels

[1:47:46] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> What would the game Fetal Frame be about?
[1:47:47] <%FunkyStreams> pretty sure she's wearing clogs.
[1:47:47] <%hereiam407> Unfathomable
[1:47:50] <akitanito> that sound is aggressive
[1:47:53] <%Buzzard42> UNFATHOMABLE FOREST
[1:47:55] <jae_ordinary> UNFATHOMABLE forest
[1:47:55] <%FunkyStreams> really poor choice of footwear

[1:54:52] <akitanito> "carried by the current"?!
[1:54:53] <%tank7013> This game kinda feels like Senran Kagura to me in that the actual gameplay is anywhere from fine to pretty good but then they just try to drown you in questionably aged tittos
[1:54:58] <%Ipsenscastle> Now choose which pictures to present to Professor Oak
[1:55:01] <zekana> why is the lead girl dressed like a cosplayer?

[1:57:16] <%FunkyStreams> nice shot, Pat

[1:57:23] <@goose_attack_almanac> @goose_attack_almanac They are! Bless those people drawing hot Sadako.
[1:57:30] <%hereiam407> Evil cults and shit
[1:57:32] <sirrice77> @doc_ock_rokc generally some sort of resentment towards the living for still being alive
[1:57:32] <ape_hawk> at the end of the unfathomable forest, does professor ghost rate our spooky photos?
[1:57:34] <p3niletrauma> This game is just trying to justify paparazzi
[1:57:36] <jae_ordinary> why would she wright this and bring it to the forest
[1:57:36] <%bugz_munny> how could you have commited suicided?
[1:57:38] <%FunkyStreams> why would suicidal people want proof of ghosts?

[1:58:07] <studleydoorite> the unfathomable forest passed the indomitable fence

[2:01:39] <SaltyAzteca> SHUTTER CHANCE
[2:01:39] <akitanito> I like how they can justify shit clipping all over the place because they are just ghosts
[2:01:46] <i_chevalier> @churropoppa i cant believe that dude even has a platform
[2:01:54] <%JoshManVGH> @churropoppa While with Ben or why with some rando on Tinder?

[2:01:57] <hearingthenseeing> Did that ghost just go BOOOOO
[2:01:58] <+JJsAdventure> lol
[2:01:58] <%SWFanatic> How can ghost scream
[2:02:03] <slimslimjim88> Moist meters are just kebab sticks you stab cakes with
[2:02:04] <@ssjklyco> Use them WiiU mechanics
[2:02:07] <studleydoorite> @akitanito the main character has been doing that a lot too
[2:02:10] <Ranger747> it green like in RE4
[2:02:11] <%FunkyStreams> goota good spread
[2:02:11] <+ProfessorMorrigan> could be a lot spooker if it wasnt so distractingly coombrained

[2:03:15] <KaitlynnHere> Die twice
[2:03:18] <$StrawberryPantsu> Ghost Hell? Isn't that Just regular Hell?
[2:03:21] <i_chevalier> Why does the MC run like that?
[2:03:22] <%JoshManVGH> So they go inside the trap containment unit?
[2:03:22] <+YourRedDog> You don't kill ghosts, Paige, you exorcise them. You love exorcising.
[2:03:23] <%ZephynM> Her run animation kinda throws me off
[2:03:26] <KaitlynnHere> Straight to hell
[2:03:31] <%MechArch> of course there are spooky ghost dolls
[2:03:34] <iswearimjustdandy> @squiglybattleopera thats why ghosts cant swim
[2:03:37] <ape_hawk> theres ghosts and booba
[2:03:37] <%hereiam407> There is not much of one so far
[2:03:39] <ape_hawk> thats it
[2:03:40] <%Anime_Flux> Something something ghosts and camera
[2:03:40] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> There is no story. Just booba
[2:03:43] <SquiglyBattleOpera> @StrawberryPantsu I mean if they're in hell then they must not be ghosts
[2:03:43] <$StrawberryPantsu> There is a Maiden and she's in black water
[2:03:54] <%Bluwizard21> @ZephynM You should see her walk through water, its just the run animation but slower
[2:03:56] <@Ranryu692> is this still Yuri? or is it a third protagonist?
[2:03:58] <KaitlynnHere> Story is suicide cult on death mountain
[2:04:00] <i_chevalier> @zephynm Right. she looks like she supposed to be carry something
[2:04:01] <%JoshManVGH> Someone instructed you on how to take pictures of ghosts and said you could do it so hard that they will DIE
[2:04:05] <Spiralpower1620> sup
[2:04:13] <churropoppa> @StrawberryPantsu ghost hell is where you go when you die. regular hell is capitalism
[2:04:16] <Aoworth> "This door is shut" It's literally MOSTLY PAPER
[2:04:17] <%tank7013> @Ranryu692 Still Yuri
[2:04:20] <Spiralpower1620> we dealing with Hot ghosts?

[2:05:34] <%JoshManVGH> @lazypointer WutFace
[2:05:39] <%tank7013> I do like the effect on the ghost voices
[2:05:41] <KaitlynnHere> @realm_forge well you don’t start with the suicide part, that’s later after the brainwashing and torture
[2:05:44] <%SWFanatic> So why does taking the picture of a ghost make them die....again? Are they just shy?
[2:05:50] <studleydoorite> it feels like you're taking pictures of HUD elements
[2:05:51] <cyb3r_demon> only PHANtoms
[2:06:01] <%Zaneofthedead> Damn she do be moaning tho
[2:06:07] <Rionxgarland> right now the ghosts feel more loke zombies
[2:06:10] <dmtjinni> 0_0

[2:06:28] <%vaporousTippler> This gives me a Killer 7 vibe, and that's weird.
[2:06:33] <crimsonsaens> That anti-mind goblin training is really doing wonders for Pat
[2:06:35] <cthulu_fearlock> they love it
[2:06:35] <SaltyAzteca> Two ghost girls one film
[2:06:38] <+rbakervv> @SWFanatic it's based on those old misconceptions of a a photo stealing people's souls, if used on something that is only soul....
[2:06:41] <+D00msDayDan> double re-kill
[2:06:41] <SquiglyBattleOpera> OH NO THE GHIOST HAND IS MAKING YOU WET
[2:06:41] <cyb3r_demon> put em in the fenton thermos

[2:06:44] <@Ranryu692> I thought that ghost was trying to pull you into a bullshit witch trial
[2:06:45] <krin_x> was this the wiiu game
[2:06:47] <%JoshManVGH> Was this on Wii or WiiU? Cause the motion controls seem like they would be nonsense on the Wii
[2:06:49] <i_chevalier> So basic youre catch their souls in the camera. this is just pokemon snap. got catchem all!
[2:06:52] <Aoworth> It's just a mischevious ghost hand
[2:06:59] <+YourRedDog> It was on Wii U
[2:07:08] <crimsonsaens> @JoshManVGH Wii U
[2:07:09] <+rbakervv> @JoshManVGH wiilu, the gamepad was the camera
[2:07:11] <krin_x> ok thanks
[2:07:13] <%Dapper_Cactuar> I really wish they had removed the stupid ghost hand gimmick in the remaster. It's not even that scary just needlessly annoying
[2:07:18] <%Bane_Kaikyo> What the fuck is this walk animation?
[2:07:21] <slimslimjim88> People don’t hold the items. Arms hold items :)
[2:07:37] <SaltyAzteca> 4 itchy tasty

[2:08:13] <%SharkMissile> Hey Fuyuhi, what are you doing here on suicide mountain? :)
[2:08:15] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Assuming ghosts are real suicide mountain would be a real bad place

[2:09:08] <@goose_attack_almanac> Remember when we joined hands and all walked into the river because Justin Macky didn't want to draw us in art class.
[2:09:09] <%DSD24> Ok this is gonna sound bad but how did they survive that
[2:09:09] <SaltyAzteca> Nah mate
[2:09:10] <+paladinstarbuster> Thats such a weird promise to make
[2:09:12] <@ssjklyco> Doesn't KoI tecmo make those senran kagura games as well? WIth the water game spin off?
[2:09:14] <KaitlynnHere> This is kinda like an anime I’d watched recently
[2:09:14] <%Treuan> falling for me
[2:09:15] <mike2hands> pact by stupid

[2:09:26] <+D00msDayDan> please do not drown your pats
[2:09:26] <KaitlynnHere> Ooooh yea, next to burning yourself alive
[2:09:27] <%xbb1024> promise never to die
[2:09:30] <i_chevalier> Japanese game developers really like sucide pacts, why is that?
[2:09:34] <+ReallyBigRocks> There are many things your body doesn't like and drowning is like top 3
[2:09:36] <%Garthunox> Harooka
[2:09:38] <leaplearning> lady macbeths
[2:09:39] <%Garthunox> Narooto
[2:09:41] <Aoworth> She's getting away!
[2:09:41] <%tank7013> Let's not leave the girl that tried to commit suicide alone on suicide mountain
[2:09:41] <%FunkyStreams> more like poisoning themselves in a rbody of water
[2:09:45] <KaitlynnHere> Also don’t overdose, that also hurts
[2:09:50] <%tank7013> God it's the worst
[2:09:53] <%orochiblood> SNK just dropped the actual Dolores trailer.
[2:09:54] <@Ranryu692> we call it the Persona 5 method

[2:10:02] <%Dapper_Cactuar> that VO came across as really stilted
[2:10:03] <+Fep3> jaycquelin
[2:10:04] <Ranger747> kaMOshida
[2:10:04] <%bevyrage> it's pronouncing foreign names with direct dialects
[2:10:06] <+D00msDayDan> gotta westernize the pronounciation of these names for the westerners that will be playing this japanese weeb game
[2:10:08] <SaltyAzteca> That happens SO often
[2:10:09] <%orochiblood> Isla/Dolores and Heidern are on the same team. Team Rival.
[2:10:11] <BreakerDS> DansGame
[2:10:13] <marklarphd> Pate
[2:10:13] <KaitlynnHere> It’s called not giving a fuck
[2:10:15] <%HairballCT> it's called racism detuneSip
[2:10:16] <@ssjklyco> It's really hard to be scared when the game keeps trying to make you horny constantly.
[2:10:16] <%SWFanatic> Yeh
[2:10:16] <+JJsAdventure> lol
[2:10:20] <Aoworth> Yeahmeahto
[2:10:21] <%FunkyStreams> its Tomato
[2:10:22] <Tracazoid> Even better, we the devs chose the dumb path. *Looks at Teedus of Final Fantasy X*
[2:10:22] <%polothegreatest> sa-suke instead of saske LUL
[2:10:29] <%tank7013> Don't pronounce the name right or you'll scare the western gamers
[2:10:33] <%SWFanatic> Yeahmato Mark 2

[2:10:39] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> Epi-Tome
[2:10:39] <SaltyAzteca> I wonder if they do it on purpose
[2:10:41] <@Ranryu692> the average person should feel stupid more often
[2:10:43] <AngryAsian5> I am stupid, can confirm.
[2:10:44] <%FunkyStreams> behold

[2:11:27] <SaltyAzteca> YEYEYEYE USE THE TONGUE
[2:11:29] <%SaiyanShoto> This is how I act when someone takes a pic of me

[2:11:34] <%Anime_Flux> reeeeeee
[2:11:35] <i_chevalier> @patstaresat Remeber when you had to mispronouce words into a mic as part of a game mechanic?
[2:11:39] <%SWFanatic> lol

[2:11:50] <@Ranryu692> @Aoworth probably some horror fans who have had the game recommended to them by weebs
[2:11:52] <mak0t0yukii> What is going on LUL
[2:11:56] <%DSD24> @i_chevalier Are you talking about Lifeline?
[2:11:58] <FirewallStorm> LUL
[2:11:59] <$StrawberryPantsu> Paige is the pointman
[2:12:00] <%Dapper_Cactuar> this ghost seems like they're having a rough time
[2:12:01] <mighty_fine_trousers> Would you leave Gief or Elmo behind if you were scared?
[2:12:01] <%MechArch> that looks so goofy
[2:12:03] <reonome> AAAAAAAAAAA
[2:12:04] <the_alphonse> PATS A COWARD
[2:12:05] <%tank7013> That was so goofy that it wrapped back around to being kind of adorable
[2:12:06] <%Anime_Flux> HAHAHAHAHA

[2:12:11] <mak0t0yukii> AAAAQA
[2:12:12] <+YourRedDog> Twelve Minutes taught us how Pat would treat his wife.
[2:12:13] <%redthebaron> friend is distraction for my escape
[2:12:15] <Zeif00> rife rine
[2:12:15] <%HotSauceFiend> is the ghost supposd to clip through the floor like that
[2:12:16] <%Agami23> i think jerma did
[2:12:16] <KaitlynnHere> With a bat?
[2:12:17] <@Ranryu692> is Lifeline the one with the racist accent?
[2:12:17] <i_chevalier> @dsd24 Yeah thats the one

[2:12:19] <%MechArch> whaaaa!
[2:12:22] <mak0t0yukii> Goofy ass ghost
[2:12:24] <KaitlynnHere> LMAO
[2:12:30] <p3niletrauma> I find it hard to believe that someone afraid of their own butthole is a champion of haunted houses
[2:12:34] <+paladinstarbuster> Jerma did it
[2:12:36] <+dmbender> How old is this game?
[2:12:37] <%AncelDeLambert> is that that voice command game? The one Joel played?
[2:12:39] <$StrawberryPantsu> Pat would end his career if he played Life Line...
[2:12:39] <%FunkyStreams> well it was a very honest note
[2:12:40] <%JoshManVGH> Spelled phonetically: The most pow war full day mon kay ta na, the Yah May Toe!
[2:12:50] <%AncelDeLambert> the one coded so that the only way to make it work is with an OBSCENELY racist accent?
[2:12:53] <%Dapper_Cactuar> BloodyFaster played Lifeline on stream and it was a glorious trainwreck
[2:12:55] <%luckyturtelle> The one Jerma played?
[2:12:56] <i_chevalier> RIFERINE! thats it. Omg
[2:12:59] <+YourRedDog> The pure water doesn't raise your wetness, only the black water or the ghosts.
[2:13:03] <$StrawberryPantsu> @dmbender It originally came out on the WiiU if that helps
[2:13:12] <%SharkMissile> @AncelDeLambert What
[2:13:13] <+paladinstarbuster> @luckyturtelle yes
[2:13:15] <%KineticZen> I feel silly for resenting the fact that this never got localized when I had a Wii
[2:13:37] <p3niletrauma> Can't wait for the Wii2U
[2:13:37] <+dmbender> @dmbender it does! The audio is uh, oof   I was wondering how old it was because of it
[2:13:45] <KaitlynnHere> @kineticzen we all had high hopes for the wii
[2:13:54] <%AncelDeLambert> @SharkMissile apparently they coded the english translation of the game in studio, so they had a guy who DID NOT SPEAK ENGLISH put in all the voice commands.
[2:13:55] <+YourRedDog> I recommend enhancing your camera's reload speed when you have enough points
[2:14:03] <SaltyAzteca> JANK JONK
[2:14:04] <%FunkyStreams> @KineticZen so this was a wii game?
[2:14:06] <akitanito> oh no gief's wetness gauge is high
[2:14:06] <crimsonsaens> @KineticZen This one did get localized, 4 didn't
[2:14:07] <%SWFanatic> Gief needum the whizzbang
[2:14:13] <%AncelDeLambert> as a result, HIS ACCENT is the correct voice input
[2:14:17] <%MechArch> psaGiefrail
[2:14:33] <%maskofmichael> Anything to not play this game, uh?
[2:14:38] <rasamune> @AncelDeLambert that's not strictly true, I don't think. Jerma streamed it a wlittle while back and didn't have to go full Mickey Rooney for it
[2:15:00] <%KineticZen> Oh right, it was the one before this one that I was mad about
[2:15:17] <rasamune> It probably depends on the person; the fact remains that the voice detection is not good
[2:15:20] <%FunkyStreams> Nevermind. Pat playing Wii game sin 2021 is why I watch this, I suppose.
[2:16:02] <%maskofmichael> Anyone here watch Halloween Kills? I think it's good.
[2:16:03] <KaitlynnHere> I just realized that pats model is just about the same height as the Elmo and gief models
[2:16:08] <%KineticZen> Probably still valid since Sude 51 worked on that one
[2:16:12] <%KineticZen> Suda*
[2:16:29] <i_chevalier> Oh man, alot of this survival horror all had the same tone on their gamea

[2:19:36] <KaitlynnHere> I could be wrong
[2:19:36] <i_chevalier> @maskofmichael Not that, everyone got all mob angry for nothing
[2:19:47] <Sol_Install> LUL

[2:26:03] <%hereiam407> Another lesbian ghost
[2:26:05] <p3niletrauma> It takes balls to cut your own throat. Dumb balls, but definitely still balls.
[2:26:06] <+chiazam> Wait what
[2:26:07] <%SWFanatic> the fresh ghost of bel air
[2:26:07] <+Hieronymous_Flex> That was close, she almost made a facial expression

[2:26:26] <%hereiam407> Fantastic, great
[2:26:27] <+paladinstarbuster> thats sad
[2:26:28] <%Piemen99> Wait would a fresh ghost just be a zombie?
[2:26:29] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> Maybe she should have done that first.
[2:26:32] <i_chevalier> She should just sing "simple and clean" from KH
[2:26:32] <akitanito> knives are dangerous
[2:26:35] <%HairballCT> @gespenstkick while you were busy having visions of ghost lesbian bath sex, i was studying the blade
[2:26:38] <Zaphire_Saucypants> all these ghosts women just want a lil smooch.
[2:26:40] <%hereiam407> Erotic X 5
[2:26:49] <%tank7013> Imagine killing yourself and having the audacity to come back as a vengeful ghost
[2:26:54] <Zaphire_Saucypants> a fresh ghost would be a zombie if it were the corporeal body.
[2:27:01] <Zaphire_Saucypants> dis is just ghost
[2:27:01] <akitanito> damn you're fucking up bad

[2:30:07] <%ahomeschooldropout> does her wetness gauge go up when you touch her
[2:30:15] <studleydoorite> yeah see this was earlier, she was always a goats

[2:30:51] <marvel877> I can't tell if this game is good or bad.
[2:30:51] <%tank7013> Pro tip chatroom: Do not pick up a mysterious ceremonial knife on the haunted suicide mountain
[2:30:55] <SaltyAzteca> There's EVIL in this FOREST
[2:30:59] <akitanito> evil lesbian ghosts
[2:30:59] <Zaphire_Saucypants> some ghost disguised as Haruka's ghost?
[2:31:01] <%redthebaron> that seems like some big evil
[2:31:01] <+paladinstarbuster> it wasnt haruka

[2:31:05] <KingSpunf> Gwyndolin?

[2:32:52] <thetruenicster> Oh NOW It's Too Dangerous
[2:33:02] <AngryAsian5> The ghosts can't handle your wetness
[2:33:02] <%hereiam407> Get dry, so you can get wet again
[2:33:13] <+paladinstarbuster> Haruka sure isnt emoting about her friend having just been killed
[2:33:13] <Ravioli_Ronin> You should have different size cameras for different types of guns, I.e. Polaroid is a hand gun, tintype is a rocket launcher, etc
[2:33:15] <KaitlynnHere> Then leave!
[2:33:23] <%JoshManVGH> Get up come on get down with the moisture
[2:33:28] <SaltyAzteca> a-a-a-alright
[2:33:34] <%tank7013> Honestly the game itself seems pretty alright. Just poor storytelling and comedically horny
[2:33:36] <%Paperware> They should make a fatal frame where you're a paparazzi just annoying the shit out of dead celebrities
[2:33:36] <%hereiam407> Uhh
[2:33:39] <%Deft_Thought> psaWhat
[2:33:43] <%Anime_Flux> Man this chick doesn't afraid of anything

[2:33:51] <Ravioli_Ronin> This doesn’t seem very poggers…
[2:33:52] <%SharkMissile> This is fine
[2:33:56] <%Anime_Flux> oh... nvm, there she goes
[2:33:59] <KaitlynnHere> @ravioli_ronin lol, can you imagine trying to set up a tintype camera out here?
[2:34:00] <rottingpastry> the dead marshes
[2:34:01] <%JoshManVGH> So is a video camera like a gatling gun to these ghosts?
[2:34:07] <iswearimjustdandy> @paperware or killing celebrities...
[2:34:09] <%Buzzard42> B, for BAD
[2:34:14] <+KingKrampus> wasn't this a game played on a Shitstorm years ago?
[2:34:17] <%Piemen99> Time to run away like a coward
[2:34:27] <%Buzzard42> SWIMSUIT
[2:34:27] <%tank7013> Not bad
[2:34:29] <%hereiam407> But is it Cyberpunk?
[2:34:30] <%redthebaron> that looks nice
[2:34:31] <Sypheck> @JoshManVGH only if it's a special Ghostbusters™ camera

[2:34:57] <@QueequegTheater> I call it "Step on Me Chic"
[2:35:02] <+YourRedDog> I never bought any items, what they give you and what you find is enough
[2:35:10] <+paladinstarbuster> I never quite understood the intended tone for fatal frame games?
[2:35:21] <%SWFanatic> From Beastars?
[2:35:22] <%Buzzard42> @SquiglyBattleOpera listen if the game has a wet t-shirt simulation engine, there's no shame to be had
[2:35:27] <rottingpastry> horny and spooky
[2:35:29] <%JoshManVGH> Oh! Could you use a satellite telescope as an orbital space cannon for ghosts!?
[2:35:29] <KaitlynnHere> ResidentSleeper

[2:38:44] <%AncelDeLambert> "It's because he wears thick clothes because he's male and therefore has a BRAIN"
[2:38:46] <KaitlynnHere> It’s because his dick is so huge
[2:38:47] <krin_x> thats cause he learned the ancient art of breaking ankles

[2:51:18] <cthulu_fearlock> oops all horny
[2:51:20] <lloyddboy> horner game
[2:51:21] <%tank7013> It would be more honest
[2:51:21] <AngryAsian5> Dead or Alive: Ghost hunt
[2:51:22] <+ALazo> not enough horny
[2:51:22] <+pyurient> taking gravuere shots with phantoms
[2:51:23] <krin_x> so what happens when they run into the real life threat of junkies that took up residence here
[2:51:23] <%The_Protagonist> i mean
[2:51:25] <+YourRedDog> I think it's just a Tecmo thing in this case. They are the DOA folks
[2:51:26] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Don't be ashamed of your horny.
[2:51:27] <%MidnightBurst12> with sex ghosts
[2:51:27] <%tank7013> And probably sell better
[2:51:28] <%polothegreatest> nope
[2:51:28] <+Psycho_Kowalski> But you gotta get into the mainstream
[2:51:31] <ExpressNode> A snuff porn disguised as a horror game
[2:51:33] <%SWFanatic> than what, strip solitaire?
[2:51:37] <%hereiam407> For people who don't know Fatal Frame, this is sneaky enough
[2:51:39] <SilverRoddo> Dead or Alive Frame? 🧐
[2:51:40] <@Ranryu692> it's not sneaky, they just rubbed vaseline on the camera lens
[2:51:41] <%The_Protagonist> there are literally costumes for this game that make it that
[2:51:48] <%Agami23> i want the opposite of this where its alot of lewd guys
[2:51:50] <JowiJoestar> wasnt the original release of this worse in that aspect?
[2:51:54] <%hereiam407> Erotic door knobs huh
[2:51:56] <SaltyAzteca> FUKKEN GHOST LOCK
[2:52:01] <%Buzzard42> the rotating camera stuff was dope
[2:52:02] <%tank7013> @krin_x The junkies were killed by ghosts they're ghost junkies now
[2:52:04] <%hereiam407> YES
[2:52:05] <%JoshManVGH> Wouldn't be surprised if this was made by the Gaiden arm of Techmo Koei
[2:52:09] <%Dr_Mooose> ghost?
[2:52:12] <Kingjoker310> Yeah
[2:52:12] <+ALazo> ghosts? A common enough story
[2:52:15] <+pyurient> totally normal
[2:52:16] <crimsonsaens> They look like ghosts to you?
[2:52:19] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I think this might be old hat for them?
[2:52:21] <%hereiam407> Its like a weird purgatory where no one wants to talk about reality
[2:52:21] <3viltiki> it's Japan. They deal with ghosts every day. Nbd
[2:52:25] <johnatella> ghost thing is just another Tuesday.
[2:52:35] <SaltyAzteca> @crimsonsaens WutFace What??
[2:52:37] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Are they like expert ghost exorcists? They DID already have the camera.
[2:52:40] <%hereiam407> They looks like boobs to you?
[2:52:45] <cthulu_fearlock> they know ghosts they know it is a thing so meh nothing to talk about
[2:52:46] <%tank7013> Well you brought the camera with you so I'd imagine the ghosts were expected
[2:52:47] <%SWFanatic> I named my left boob Totoro
[2:52:48] <+D00msDayDan> my father was kiki's delivery service
[2:52:52] <%JoshManVGH> Are they professional ghost hunters? Private Detectives? Like what's the deal
[2:52:54] <dan_g_v> it's just same old same old
[2:53:02] <Ranger747> LUL

[2:53:05] <SilverRoddo> Well, that dude Full Metal Panic Fumoffu was glad that ghost wasn’t a bomb.

[2:53:19] <@ssjklyco> Bayonetta was sneakier than this with it's horny
[2:53:22] <+D00msDayDan> not a small number of people when it comes to your chat
[2:53:23] <scrumbotime> Would that mean the boob ghosts don't have massive dobonhonkeros? DAMN YOU SILENT HILL
[2:53:23] <%Anime_Flux> Vincent was such an ass
[2:53:23] <%tank7013> "In my restless dreams, I see those boobs"

[2:53:43] <%MidnightBurst12> I love the resident evil series Kappa

[2:55:04] <%hereiam407> At least it isn't wax, hair and a horse shoe
[2:55:13] <+D00msDayDan> did fatal frame ever progress to smartphone cameras or does only dreadout go there?
[2:55:16] <slimslimjim88> I know about your fathers watch D:
[2:55:22] <OneThousandTomatoes> that's a stylish ghost
[2:55:26] <%SWFanatic> I'll make you famous
[2:55:29] <SaltyAzteca> YER BEAUTIFUL BABY
[2:55:31] <akitanito> f-f-f-fatal frame
[2:55:32] <AngryAsian5> This ghost posing LUL
[2:55:33] <SaltyAzteca> OWN THAT CAMERA
[2:55:38] <%Buzzard42> POINTS
[2:55:39] <%hereiam407> I would think Fatal Frame would be perfect for VR or AR
[2:55:43] <scrumbotime> that frame sure was fatal
[2:55:47] <%polothegreatest> THATS  IT, POSE FOR THE CAMERA
[2:55:49] <Thepothero> Do asll ghosts looks the same in this ?
[2:55:50] <%Buzzard42> tbh the combat in this game is pretty great
[2:55:51] <MiamiMemory> These ghost are cringe
[2:55:52] <3viltiki> I like how Rui was just, "Oh shit. Are ghosts happening? Lemme, lemme get out of the way"
[2:56:02] <dan_g_v> faaantastic
[2:56:03] <KingSpunf> Rui when ghosts all up n her bits: :|
[2:56:08] <OneThousandTomatoes> ok hear me out, Fatal Frame Go
[2:56:14] <%SharkMissile> 2 so good
[2:56:16] <%JoshManVGH> These ghost sounds sound like they are incredibly optimized for some sort of handheld speaker...
[2:56:18] <%tank7013> Nice
[2:56:19] <crimsonsaens> @Thepothero no, this is the second or third level
[2:56:19] <%hereiam407> @OneThousandTomatoes Yes
[2:56:21] <%SWFanatic> bye
[2:56:26] <%tank7013> K bye
[2:56:28] <SaltyAzteca> okay byeeee
[2:56:29] <KingSpunf> 2 is very good
[2:56:30] <akitanito> that's fast
[2:56:32] <%Buzzard42> oh jeeze
[2:56:32] <heybenice> @onethousandtomatoes tomatoDread
[2:56:34] <SaltyAzteca> WHOA
[2:56:35] <placeholder03> 2 is very good
[2:56:35] <%Anime_Flux> Get him, sidekick!
[2:56:35] <%hereiam407> @OneThousandTomatoes You've given me a game idea
[2:56:38] <%SWFanatic> that ghosts a maniac
[2:57:00] <%The_Protagonist> she got hit by the ghost and doesn't even go like "WOAH WHA JUST HIT ME" or anything
[2:57:03] <KingSpunf> FF2 is like the third best horror game on the PS2 after SH2 and 3
[2:57:12] <scrumbotime> that's his rope
[2:57:15] <akitanito> I think those are glass shards
[2:57:15] <+wholehole> 2 is pretty good, but some of the later ghosties really ruin any atmosphere they may have built up just through sheer frustration
[2:57:16] <Thepothero> A noose pat
[2:57:17] <%hereiam407> Is he hanging on a rope?
[2:57:21] <+YourRedDog> I think that's glass shards in his back
[2:57:23] <devanmuse> @swfanatic WHY'D HE BITE ME
[2:57:25] <+tempestzephyr> Let me suck you dick, BoOoOooOoo~
[2:57:31] <%Anime_Flux> sick ghost elbow drops
[2:57:42] <%hereiam407> Thats gotta hurt
[2:57:43] <MiamiMemory> Just hang in there
[2:57:43] <akitanito> he fucked up his suicide super hard
[2:57:55] <+wholehole> I honestly think a remake of the first game could be a better choice if they updated with quality of life stuff
[2:58:06] <%SWFanatic> Whats that smell? It's wet boobs
[2:58:08] <jackedup92> parry frame
[2:58:21] <%hereiam407> Head, shoulder, knees and toes, knees and toes
[2:58:21] <scrumbotime> I think its kinda funny that the games run on pokemon snap rules and you spend points "I know we're fighting ghosts, but I have to level up my camera stats"
[2:58:24] <AngryAsian5> Combos
[2:58:24] <%JoshManVGH> lol the orbs look like they are being absorbed by the PATrons counter!
[2:58:29] <Dova573> This has become a ghost adventure?!
[2:58:29] <+CrimsonDio11> has Pat ever played Lost in Vivo?
[2:58:31] <$floralkami> I'm ready. Are you ready?
[2:58:32] <Estuko> Where's the vacuum? Isn't that how you get the ghosts?
[2:58:44] <SaltyAzteca> The film isnt very good at exorcising ghosts
[2:58:50] <%hereiam407> Vacuum obscure would be great
[2:58:57] <akitanito> wait was he a boss
[2:58:57] <%SWFanatic> bye
[2:58:58] <%hereiam407> Wait, Luigi has the Vacuum Obscura
[2:59:09] <%JoshManVGH> The man who refused to die... again
[2:59:23] <$Quinn_Carter> That was not something I needed to hear after literally just getting here
[2:59:24] <OneThousandTomatoes> this really seems like it would work as a ar mobile or vr game
[2:59:25] <+YourRedDog> Rui isn't left at all.
[2:59:34] <%RetroCop87> wait, is there a sony thing happening tonight?
[2:59:35] <%polothegreatest> this is the same as yakuzas "ill kill you" LUL

[3:00:31] <%tank7013> I should do it too. Oh no I fucked up now I have to drag someone else into it so that I can try to kill them after I die

[3:03:42] <akitanito> is assisted suicide
[3:03:43] <%tank7013> You should probably have physically dragged Rui away from the edge before fighting the ghost but whatever
[3:03:43] <$realm_forge> How do the ghosts work here? Do they overwhelm you with depression?
[3:03:47] <%greasypete00> it's because it wants to die

[3:05:05] <%THATGUY_789> why would you commit suicide
[3:05:08] <akitanito> wait, even ren has a blooming flower
[3:05:08] <%CatastropheCorvid> "The gang gets de-monitized by YouTube"
[3:05:09] <%whyskeywolfe> Stop quoting Neil Breen he hasn't been relevant since the Trump years.
[3:05:11] <+D00msDayDan> maybe the real fatal frame was the friends we forced to commit suicide along the way
[3:05:13] <%hereiam407> Spinning is a good trick
[3:05:13] <%WaitHowDidIGetHere> Something something Logan Paul
[3:05:15] <+ReallyBigRocks> cool spin move

[3:05:38] <%WaitHowDidIGetHere> Hey! It’s that ghost!
[3:05:39] <OtakuSnake1> I can't believe this ghost commited spinicide
[3:05:42] <%tank7013> This game truly is a Logan Paul survival horror
[3:05:42] <%LaughingCatt> reject pesticide
[3:05:44] <BlindGato> Did that ghost just get parried?
[3:05:47] <%polothegreatest> cmon, smile for the camera, darling

[3:06:23] <$Quinn_Carter> I thought Fatal Frame was a horror game, why are you get smoking sexy style combos with a camera?
[3:06:23] <%chance_h> "omaiwa mo shin jiru" ghost
[3:06:27] <%WaitHowDidIGetHere> The ghost is telling you to stop using Dutch angles like a tool.
[3:06:37] <doublebarrelledoblivion> Hey Pat
[3:06:39] <%afronooch> damn he really bout to get deflowered by a ghost
[3:06:40] <InuOblivion> multishot during parry frame
[3:06:41] <%RetroCop87> I wonder if this game is a bad attempt for the Japanese to blame ghosts for their high suicide rates
