[0:37:20] <%Gogogolem> I wish iliked this game.
[0:37:21] <%XzileGaming> crit draw was only good in previous mh imho

[0:37:30] <%FacetiousAF> jesus i wish we could keep serious handler
[0:37:30] <%StaceMcGate> Serious Business Handler
[0:37:31] <%dekkitout> We all wish that
[0:37:32] <Lostinafantasy> Me too
[0:37:32] <+jake_protagonist> theres gonna be a mod for that im sure
[0:37:33] <CyprienCole> I like the game but friends don't play enough
[0:37:34] <KitsuneManami> @AngriestPat MOds
[0:37:34] <alphonseisbest> what armour set do u consider actually cool and not ironic
[0:37:34] <+dante_must_die_exe> But Estellese tho
[0:37:34] <Storm_Samurai> Serious Handler <3
[0:37:35] <%Taisuru> Crit draw isn't worth using in world anyways
[0:37:38] <kylejefferies> ya ever take a dump that makes you feel about 5 pounds lighter?
[0:37:38] <@SSaryn> Plus new True Focused Slash is fucking incredible
[0:37:38] <$spardanwarrior> Just get Mr. X
[0:37:40] <moosemonkey397> youre on PC, of course you can keep her
[0:37:41] <TsunTsuchinoko> is there a mod for serios handler?
[0:37:43] <%Aleate> I love serious handler so much. But Mr. X handler is good too ruuGasm
[0:37:46] <%FacetiousAF> i'll drop fuckin $5 for serious handler
[0:37:46] <Tucker0603> I like normal handler myself but I understand why
[0:37:48] <%Ipsenscastle> By the end of Iceborne you'll have affinity coming out your ears anyway
[0:37:52] <%D00msDayDan> i hope the first mod once iceborne comes out is serious handler all the time
[0:37:53] <mayorrev> what's serious handler?
[0:37:58] <KitsuneManami> @AngriestPat you can actually Mod her in perma.
[0:37:59] <%grimm_hatter> we deserve serious handler
[0:38:06] <%depressed_skeleton> Pat you got a big head
[0:38:10] <+CptnCampy61> I’d pay money to keep serious handler
[0:38:11] <%cvp5127> Kreygasm
[0:38:16] <@SSaryn> I feel like if they just sold Serious Handler as DLC, I'd do it.
[0:38:17] <@commanderclaw> God, she's such a dork
[0:38:23] <SpaceGuntank> she's a ditzy airhead who is a DORK
[0:38:24] <%radda343> I don't get why people don't like regular handler, she cute
[0:38:31] <Zebroneath> Just replace Handler with Mr. X LUL
[0:38:31] <%XzileGaming> PAIGE HANDLER for DLC
[0:38:32] <KitsuneManami> @radda343 voice
[0:38:36] <%honeyman18> We gonna see big Grandma Chef tonight?
[0:38:37] <AGood_Noodle> I would buy that DLC
[0:38:37] <%Ipsenscastle> I was so disappointed you can't toggle the handlers
[0:38:39] <@SSaryn> I love her animations way more and she's really cute when that Steamworks shit explodes
[0:38:43] <Storm_Samurai> "When in doubt, take a bi...." FACE PUNCH
[0:38:43] <mayorrev> Is Mr. X a handler?
[0:38:43] <AmericanaRed> ALPHA HANDLER
[0:38:43] <+Kurt_0> Lady lady woman
[0:38:45] <%ThatOneGameTester> i'd pay 10 because that's about how much it will take for them to do it
[0:38:50] <%logoth_> regular handler is an annoying moron who causes you to eat an ice block to the BACK
[0:38:52] <%Gogogolem> Can the handler just be a one of the cat people meowing at you.
[0:39:01] <@commanderclaw> TIME FOR SOME WHIFFS
[0:39:02] <Storm_Samurai> yeyeyeyeyeye

[0:44:20] <KitsuneManami> @AngriestPat You must have the Rusty Mantal on
[0:44:22] <+flexin_apex> Oh it’s gonna be great seeing pat going thru these iceborne monsters ...jolly good time indeed!
[0:44:24] <UchiVsTheWorld> take it off already LUL

[0:44:40] <Shishi1205> btw not that good anymore
[0:44:40] <shanasblue> Hey Pat, idk if you remember me from Peach's stream but I was the one who said you and Woolie sorta saved my life. I elaborated on how on twitter but I guess you guys didn't see it? Should I re-tag you?
[0:44:40] <mayorrev> Why's your hood glowing?
[0:44:44] <+zanzibar_junker> Mantles super nerfed
[0:44:53] <%ChaosAethr> So Years
[0:44:55] <@ThePlotHole> You stopped playing when Behemoth came out
[0:44:55] <Tucker0603> OH FUCK
[0:44:58] <+dante_must_die_exe> Temporal got super nerfed
[0:44:58] <@ThePlotHole> Like literally a year
[0:44:58] <+Elky3> 4 million years it has been Kappa
[0:44:59] <malesin_01> thought it was called the baby blanket
[0:45:00] <KitsuneManami> @AngriestPat you really should get back into it, a lot of the harder stuff is awesome
[0:45:04] <moosemonkey397> I got turned off by Kulve because I couldnt solo it
[0:45:05] <Dragovus> off to a rollicking good start
[0:45:07] <SpaceGuntank> only the Temporal got hard nerfed. the rest of the mantles are fine chat, some even better now.
[0:45:07] <+IncredibleMeh> Chat is maximum levels of not knowing anything today
[0:45:08] <UchiVsTheWorld> it is the baby blanket
[0:45:10] <%ThatOneGameTester> i play this with keyboard & mouse, the hand gymnastics are brutal and my hands are likely the same size as pats if not smaller
[0:45:11] <superchronicc> the camara monster
[0:45:11] <%honeyman18> This is the optimum stream
[0:45:16] <+flexin_apex> Be cuz new games
[0:45:22] <+dasboss1702> Just got to the credits on the base game, how much content is left?
[0:45:22] <Tucker0603> just so ya know temporal mantle got a nerf
[0:45:29] <%depressed_skeleton> Woooow
[0:45:30] <shadowboss89> I thought you got turned off to it because the event quest were limited time only
[0:45:36] <+Elky3> Getting into Hunting games @AngriestPat s orginal series Kappa
[0:45:37] <SpaceGuntank> jokes on you pat, i play on consoles.
[0:45:38] <KitsuneManami> Influencing like DSP does
[0:45:38] <%cvp5127> lewd
[0:45:40] <superchronicc> max is more into it than you are, and he is a fighting game streamer
[0:45:41] <%depressed_skeleton> Ok that seems accurate
[0:45:48] <shanasblue> maybe I should have put that into a donation message....
[0:45:48] <+zanzibar_junker> SAFI´JIIVA is nuts
[0:45:52] <%dekkitout> @ThatOneGameTester Would setting up macros be that much of a faux pas?
[0:45:56] <%VashyronM> Give Pat what he wants so he goes away.
[0:45:57] <KitsuneManami> @Tucker0603 how was it nerfed
[0:46:10] <leinadtonu> You should play monster hunter Pat.
[0:46:11] <+HelloImTom08> its not like the mantle is useless, it didnt get nerfed like flash bombs did
[0:46:11] <KitsuneManami> Holy shit they gave him a HUGE overhal
[0:46:28] <+flexin_apex> I wonder how many orbs offer pat gives out
[0:46:29] <%Aleate> This thing is dangerous sometimes ruuS
[0:46:31] <UchiVsTheWorld> cat being the mvp on this match
[0:46:49] <%CopperTucker> MVP Elmo
[0:46:56] <Tucker0603> @kitsunemanami I think either the duration was nerfed or use of it eats more time on it. can't remember
[0:46:59] <UchiVsTheWorld> ludroth is a huge pimp
[0:47:04] <shardlab> I certainly don't miss Ludroth
[0:47:09] <KitsuneManami> @AngriestPat whats your gear? you might have negative water
[0:47:10] <moosemonkey397> Whats that Pat? I heard * bring back underwater Gobul*
[0:47:11] <shardlab> Too much rolling
[0:47:11] <%king_wragles> R. Ludo was a fun fight, but with garbo gear

[0:47:40] <dickbuttwoman> Maaaaaan you got iceborne early? I so wanna play it
[0:47:41] <%GarbageNirvana> Lagiacrus is never coming back
[0:47:41] <%king_wragles> Lagi best boi
[0:47:41] <Lostinafantasy> Me Too
[0:47:42] <%Taisuru> Pat you should really be using your clutch claw stuff more
[0:47:43] <startstoprepeat> bring back khezu
[0:47:44] <%furiousfurioso> Gore and Shagaru are dope
[0:47:45] <dickbuttwoman> Was just doing ATKT
[0:47:46] <@commanderclaw> They'll need new environments for Lagi
[0:47:46] <%Ipsenscastle> brachydios has best soundtrack, fight me
[0:47:46] <SpaceGuntank> ziggy and his evil brother stiggy ziggy
[0:47:47] <%honeyman18> He seems like a coral colored boy, and I like him.
[0:47:49] <%ThatOneGameTester> Best hammer ever
[0:47:51] <KitsuneManami> @AngriestPat I actually liked the water stuff >_> does that make me bad or just better than everyone because i didnt suck at it :P
[0:47:52] <+Freelance7> Lagiacrus isn't coming back in World. Probably in the next game.
[0:47:54] <%GarbageNirvana> He was built for underwater fighting and that's never coming back so
[0:47:57] <AGood_Noodle> He will be in the next game
[0:48:00] <Lostinafantasy> I hope he shows up in MH6
[0:48:05] <%dekkitout> Well- if I had that option as a swinglance main, I would just macro my shit
[0:48:07] <shardlab> I'm just annoyed we didn't get Lagombi
[0:48:08] <TapAtoLive> Gore's probably gonna be added in, Capcom said Leviathans in general won't be in world, tho.
[0:48:08] <superchronicc> i thought in an early demo for world, lagiacrus was in it, but was removed later
[0:48:10] <Nested_Dreams> @kitsunemanami IIRC Temporal mantle got changed to a shorter duration that gets reduced with each dodge the mantle does, so it can only work up to three times or so
[0:48:17] <+Freelance7> @GarbageNirvana No they made a land fight version. They just couldn't get him to work with the current system.
[0:48:23] <$FluffiTamamo> Hay, you did da thing
[0:48:27] <%GarbageNirvana> Ah, well
[0:48:31] <+zanzibar_junker> Wall splat
[0:48:32] <KitsuneManami> @Nested_Dreams wow
[0:48:33] <katocrimson> moss nearby
[0:48:34] <shardlab> They make an expansion called Iceborne and don't put in Lagombi?
[0:48:35] <+OrangePancake20> I wish they could get his skeleton working for iceborne
[0:48:37] <Lostinafantasy> Did Pat forget about the Clutch Cla?
[0:48:47] <%zeif00> Clutch Claw tho
[0:48:49] <KitsuneManami> @AngriestPat he looks harder than that zombie dragon now LOL
[0:48:49] <%ThatOneGameTester> whoa that heal was fast
[0:48:53] <TapAtoLive> @superchronicc he was, but apparently leviathans clipped through terrain too much, so they axed the monster type entirely.
[0:48:55] <+HelloImTom08> temporal is still good for safe clutch claws weakening
[0:49:00] <Theoyveyman> Devs said that Lagis skeleton cidn't work in the engine, so he was scrapped
[0:49:15] <UchiVsTheWorld> dont worry, clutch claw makes it too easy
[0:49:17] <superchronicc> @TapAtoLive big bummer

[0:52:21] <KitsuneManami> @AngriestPat Gobbler is the BEST fucking Gem by far Isnt it?
[0:52:22] <$FluffiTamamo> Don’t forget your flinch shots. The knockdowns do huge amounts.

[0:55:31] <Ner234> No Pat ONLY DPS
[0:55:32] <%radda343> they need to have a fist weapon that lets you suplex the dragons
[0:55:32] <%mordred_t> Pat, the best one is Health Boost, bar none, in Iceborne.
[0:55:33] <Goldenwolf98> BUT THEY DONT GIVE BIG NUMBER
[0:55:34] <dickbuttwoman> Nah man. Best defense is good offense
[0:55:34] <%thegreatbambe> yea but muh dps race

[0:55:49] <SilverFaustX> pat go to the npc for a free armor set, they put it ingame so ppl can rush tru iceborne
[0:55:49] <@SSaryn> To be fair, Strident's got the right idea, as long as you didn't die, you did the big good job.
[0:55:50] <Kerra192> the only defensive skill you need is health boost
[0:55:52] <KitsuneManami> But BiG NuMbER
[0:55:58] <%Agami23> free meal build OP
[0:56:01] <+Penguin93> @AngriestPat utility doesnt make number get big though

[0:56:02] <KitsuneManami> Long Sword Time!
[0:56:02] <%BakiinPlaysStuff> The way I do it is chose what utility I want to go for first then pad out the rest with damage boosting skills
[0:56:03] <+zanzibar_junker> Use items for free
[0:56:04] <alwayspronking> Clap

[1:03:49] <malesin_01> @kitsunemanami in seliana
[1:03:51] <MiskatonicAlum> narc is a good LS
[1:03:56] <Shishi1205> btw narga weapons not that good on iceborne
[1:03:57] <KitsuneManami> was gonna be MAD
[1:04:03] <zenith0111> @tearonex Nothing stopping you from using it besides you chasing the purple dragon that is the meta
[1:04:03] <Shishi1205> the armor set is used tho
[1:04:10] <KitsuneManami> "Weebgras"
[1:04:11] <MiskatonicAlum> I like it....
[1:04:12] <%Taisuru> It's fine
[1:04:16] <superchronicc> spoilers
[1:04:16] <$FluffiTamamo> Pro tip for future mass forging: the research base forgeman has no cutscene.
[1:04:17] <%king_wragles> ONE GUY
[1:04:19] <%GarbageNirvana> It's decent mid-tier
[1:04:21] <TsunTsuchinoko> it's fine, takes less to optimize
[1:04:21] <+Freelance7> No spoilers
[1:04:22] <SilverFaustX> max used the free armor
[1:04:24] <%Taisuru> IT'S TOTALLY FINE PAT
[1:04:25] <MiskatonicAlum> i mean, its all safi now
[1:04:27] <@SSaryn> Longsword genuinely got a lot of shit.
[1:04:28] <Shishi1205> its not good dont even lie
[1:04:30] <MiskatonicAlum> so nothing else matters.
[1:04:31] <based_versauen> Narga LS is GREAT
[1:04:37] <mobius_won> His hog is still great
[1:04:39] <KitsuneManami> cant wait for the new housing
[1:04:42] <Goldenwolf98> Long sword is even more weeb now
[1:04:43] <mobius_won> Hbg*
[1:04:44] <%DedlokPM> What is that on Pat's head. Also what in gods name is his character's helmet?
[1:04:47] <Oleam458> Aiight fam I got you
[1:04:48] <malesin_01> narga is good mid game before the final boss
[1:04:50] <%Taisuru> Pat do not listen to ONE GUY, Narga LS is fine
[1:04:52] <%ThatOneGameTester> That's a lack of pets i nthat room
[1:04:58] <BlueLunecy> Imagine not picking weapons based entirely on looks
[1:05:03] <Mortal_Wombat_I> They’re not great endgame, but they’re good enough
[1:05:05] <%king_wragles> @SSaryn I mean, the gold & silver rathi LS's aren't too shabby
[1:05:13] <KitsuneManami> WoAH a actual total damage meter now
[1:05:13] <MiskatonicAlum> spirit sheathe is the new thing
[1:05:23] <+Galoari> I hate grping with ppl that use long sword :p slows everything down
[1:05:25] <Shishi1205> Spam r2 + triangle
[1:05:27] <$FluffiTamamo> Do your weeb-ass Zantetsuken
[1:05:28] <superchronicc> pat is channeling his inner weeb
[1:05:31] <Shishi1205> R2+X into
[1:05:37] <Oleam458> Spirit sheathe after an attack
[1:05:38] <+Kurt_0> So what your saying is there’s a lot of bang for your buck
[1:05:40] <%Tearonex> @zenith0111 Only thing stopping me right now is the fact that I haven't come across Luna yet :(
[1:05:41] <sonofthedeepsouth> apatWhat_RD bokoenOoo_TK apatWhat_RD
[1:05:45] <Gato_Explosivo> after attack you press trigger and A
[1:05:54] <Oleam458> Y will give you infinite meter
[1:05:55] <Shishi1205> there you go
[1:05:56] <Whiteowlsmith> isn't that the counter move thing?
[1:05:57] <Ner234> anime af
[1:05:59] <Goldenwolf98> WEEB MODE
[1:05:59] <KitsuneManami> @AngriestPat 2nd Counter
[1:06:00] <%D00msDayDan> WEEEEEEB
[1:06:01] <Whiteowlsmith> that like gives meter?
[1:06:02] <%Aleate> LUL
[1:06:03] <+Pecker_Wizard> Its basically a double foresight
[1:06:04] <sonofthedeepsouth> Oh no Pat is a great sword user
[1:06:04] <Shishi1205> your new best friend
[1:06:06] <%Shoosler> Climhazard
[1:06:07] <MillaMoks> @AngriestPat It's a stupid OP anime counter
[1:06:07] <Oleam458> RT wills pend a gauge for mad damage and hard Knockdown
[1:06:07] <Theoyveyman> Can't trip up your friends with LS if you don't have any friends
[1:06:08] <alwayspronking> It gives you get bar
[1:06:08] <sonofthedeepsouth> ANIME
[1:06:09] <Dragovus> IT's JUST LIKE ONE OF MY JAPANESE ANIMES
[1:06:09] <Ner234> It's a counter
[1:06:09] <+Elky3> RPGAyaya RPGAyaya RPGAyaya
[1:06:10] <%radda343> we sekiro now
[1:06:12] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat the normal slash from sheath gives you boosted charge.
[1:06:15] <%Taisuru> RT + A After an attack pat
[1:06:15] <+HelloImTom08> WEEB attack engaged
[1:06:16] <%Ipsenscastle> 100% cumhazard
[1:06:18] <sonofthedeepsouth> bokoenOoo_TK bokoenOoo_TK bokoenOoo_TK bokoenOoo_TK bokoenOoo_TK
[1:06:18] <Zebroneath> One gives meter, the other is a counter.
[1:06:19] <Mortal_Wombat_I> Try to Spirit Sheathe after different combos
[1:06:23] <warmnoid> [CHANNELING WEEB ENERGY]
[1:06:23] <zenith0111> Have you never played LS?!?!
[1:06:24] <Gato_Explosivo> do it after your final trigger attack for quick recovery
[1:06:24] <Goldenwolf98> After an attack
[1:06:25] <Shishi1205> r2 + X
[1:06:27] <MiskatonicAlum> the spirit follow up from spirit sheathe doesnt consume spirit gauge if it would evade an attack
[1:06:32] <mobius_won> G
[1:06:35] <katocrimson> tri to tri+R2
[1:06:36] <Calern> Boomer pat
[1:06:36] <%Taisuru> RT + A after an attack
[1:06:36] <Oleam458> You can only sheathe after attacks
[1:06:37] <KitsuneManami> R2-X
[1:06:37] <%Aleate> That sheath attack has massive knock down potential if the monster is charging. Its so weird
[1:06:41] <alwayspronking> RT+A
[1:06:42] <%Ipsenscastle> r2 x
[1:06:43] <BlueLunecy> It's on the side of the screen pat
[1:06:45] <%CopperTucker> Finally we have the Daikatana
[1:06:45] <Rshiners> pat it's at the bottom left
[1:06:47] <+Spec7re> Pat must unleash his inner weeb
[1:06:51] <MonstarGrrrl> FailFish
[1:07:01] <%punished_mug> punished_mug subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 27 months! Gunlance is best weapon
[1:07:02] <sonofthedeepsouth> mAYBE THE DAIKATANA WERE THE FRIENDS WE MADE
[1:07:05] <$FluffiTamamo> Right trigger and jump
[1:07:05] <sonofthedeepsouth> ALONG THE WAY
[1:07:11] <$FluffiTamamo> Whatever bone pad has
[1:07:13] <%Ipsenscastle> Pat pronounced Iai correctly, confirmed weeb
[1:07:16] <superchronicc> "cries in weeb"
[1:07:18] <SGrim> @AngriestPat you can use that as superarmor in a pinch!
[1:07:23] <sonofthedeepsouth> he is fast
[1:07:24] <%Taisuru> ANIME
[1:07:25] <Ner234> PogChamp
[1:07:26] <%cvp5127> a n i m e

[1:07:40] <%Gogogolem> Anaaaamaaaaaaay
[1:07:40] <Oleam458> so after the Iai slash you can stab and combo back into sheathe again @AngriestPat
[1:07:40] <cureneckbeard> Sword Pat Online
[1:07:40] <%cvp5127> h-hayai
[1:07:40] <xeros720> with the powers of chat and anime on your side
[1:07:41] <alwayspronking> And that has I-frames. But only like 4. Be careful
[1:07:42] <+WarbossMetal> What, the longsword wasnt anime enough already?
[1:07:43] <@SSaryn> It's pretty good.
[1:07:43] <Shishi1205> That R2+X into Triangle is your new best friend
[1:07:44] <Goldenwolf98> You are the Vergil
[1:07:45] <$Arcaenum> Do it after the last hit of the spirit combo or after helm breaker
[1:07:46] <zenith0111> WEABOO MODE WEABOO MODE
[1:07:46] <%Kilagn> ANIME
[1:07:48] <Mortal_Wombat_I> You can really abuse Iai Slash to max out your spirit
[1:07:51] <MiskatonicAlum> DB also got some fun anime ninja crap
[1:07:51] <%SlashHabit> the animations are pretty good
[1:07:52] <%zeif00> kay tahnuh
[1:07:52] <%Kilagn> PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[1:07:54] <+PatchworkSquid> THIS WHOLE GAME IS ANIME
[1:07:57] <TrollKing96> Has Pat never used a Long Sword?!
[1:08:00] <artificiallynatural> lytMOTIVATED WEEB MODE lytMOTIVATED
[1:08:06] <cureneckbeard> more like two meter management. eh
[1:08:07] <sonofthedeepsouth> I'm motivated
[1:08:07] <+Kurt_0> Now that’s what I’m talking about
[1:08:12] <+Silv3rS0und> So when is Capcom adding motorcycles are weapons in MHW?
[1:08:17] <Shishi1205> the triangle attack after Iai increases your spirit bar slowly
[1:08:21] <@SSaryn> It's pretty much all about keeping up consistent damage while getting to red.
[1:08:22] <%ThatOneGameTester> That's how you add a higher skill floor to a basic bitch weapon Kappa
[1:08:26] <%Aleate> While you were using the Great Sword, Pat was studying the blade
[1:08:27] <+HelloImTom08> you should change the training dummy from the housekeeper cat, the bigger dummy is more useful imo @AngriestPat
[1:08:28] <xeros720> does the iai get stronger if you hold it?
[1:08:28] <Shishi1205> thats the new counter btw
[1:08:32] <+mechslayer71> He got to Tiggy yet?
[1:08:35] <%radda343> apatBig weebs
[1:08:36] <@SSaryn> With Foresight Slash and Iai Slash it's JUST easier to keep it going.
[1:08:36] <fruit_pie_the_magician> HAMMER
[1:08:48] <Railgun5> @AngriestPat You can use the special sheathe after a helmsplitter and the final RT combo attack
[1:08:51] <Shishi1205> thats the counter
[1:08:53] <+PatchworkSquid> nah, it's great.
[1:08:55] <xeros720> that's good, it's a pure counter
[1:08:58] <Theoyveyman> If you think this is anime, just wait till the new Glavenus subspecies
[1:09:03] <Gato_Explosivo> those slashes get the bonus of crit draw and punishing draw too
[1:09:03] <$FluffiTamamo> @xeros720 Nah, just to buy time.
[1:09:04] <Goldenwolf98> Flinches
[1:09:05] <sonofthedeepsouth> SHEATHE ALL
[1:09:05] <%Kilagn> Lance and Shield is still the best weapon in the the game tho apatDab apatDab
[1:09:06] <superchronicc> you stun them
[1:09:08] <sonofthedeepsouth> judgement cut
[1:09:14] <+SeantySean> use the switch axe it's real big
[1:09:15] <%Taisuru> Flinch monster so you can get the full combo
[1:09:17] <+Shadicara> judgement nut
[1:09:18] <+zanzibar_junker> Flinches
[1:09:23] <alwayspronking> it staggers
[1:09:23] <KitsuneManami> almost ALL are like that
[1:09:27] <Shishi1205> a lot of weapons have it
[1:09:28] <Mortal_Wombat_I> Counter attack using that one
[1:09:30] <+mechslayer71> @kilagn sbfpRage sbfpScared sbfpSOB
[1:09:32] <Shishi1205> hammer and cb too
[1:09:36] <+zinris> you can also turn complete 180 degrees with that
[1:09:44] <Billli11> you can sheath after spirits finisher.
[1:09:44] <GMKGoat> but hunting horn tho
[1:09:45] <Gato_Explosivo> Hunting horn got a whole other note to play around with

[1:09:58] <+zanzibar_junker> Yes
[1:09:58] <superchronicc> you just never leave seliana

[1:20:44] <KitsuneManami> @AngriestPat "Long Sword is for NOOBS" Rite?
[1:20:45] <alwayspronking> Yes, its very fun!
[1:20:48] <%SlashHabit> is this part of a DLC?
[1:20:49] <Shishi1205> you can efectively combo r2 into iai triangle into spirit thrust
[1:20:51] <+zinris> down a slope
[1:20:55] <zenith0111> They added two moves pat LUL
[1:20:55] <+Vigonept> down a hill
[1:20:58] <alwayspronking> like, sliding down a hill
[1:20:59] <Tucker0603> slope mqn
[1:21:00] <%Aleate> Running downhill
[1:21:00] <%XzileGaming> oh geez
[1:21:03] <xeros720> long sword got a lot in world
[1:21:07] <%radda343> is all the new combo in the base game or just the xpac
[1:21:08] <%Agami23> i feel like greatsword, switch axe, and longsword got the most.
[1:21:14] <alwayspronking> Its like, a WHOLE NEW WORLD
[1:21:21] <Mortal_Wombat_I> Sliding down a slope
[1:21:23] <olgafl0w> pat fillthy dex user now
[1:21:23] <%Fox_Rezard> is Sword and Shield still best weapon?
[1:21:28] <+Remery_> Just want more Bow abilities :)
[1:21:30] <%Ipsenscastle> nice
[1:21:45] <Oleam458> so after Helm splitter you can Sheathe and just rinse and repeat the combo in any flavor
[1:21:49] <Aydarkzero> SnS is always the best weapon
[1:21:59] <jcflyguy> I'll always be a Lance person
[1:22:04] <Shishi1205> you need to get used to cahining r2 finishes into iai sheates
[1:22:18] <+Vigonept> sword and shield gets a strong combo do good
[1:22:25] <$Dakuu75> is that draw-attack iceborn stuff?
[1:22:26] <Jack_Nightshadow> The best weapon is the weapon you are most comfortable with.
[1:22:26] <+Tee_Ehh> wait wtf is it out on PC already?
[1:22:32] <fruit_pie_the_magician> @AngriestPat They added an entire new bar and function to chargeblade
[1:22:36] <KitsuneManami> Hit R2 again if you counter with Feint Slash
[1:22:38] <Swish19XX> I like to be Guts
[1:22:39] <Nested_Dreams> Ah, the LS clutch grab move sounds so great
[1:22:40] <Ner234> Great LUL Jagras
[1:22:40] <%xemnahort> @tee_ehh early code
[1:22:42] <%XzileGaming> Woolgras
[1:22:44] <Jack_Nightshadow> No, Pat got an early copy.
[1:22:44] <Mortal_Wombat_I> If he’s charging, clutch into his tail, you’ll be pretty much safe to get ammo off of him or soften it up
[1:22:47] <%Ipsenscastle> @Aydarkzero I like the SnS but I can never consistently get the backstep right for some reason
[1:22:47] <+Tee_Ehh> Ahh dang
[1:22:48] <%DedlokPM> @Tee_Ehh I am thinking he got a early access code from capcom
[1:22:50] <Shishi1205> yes
[1:22:50] <Oleam458> Yes
[1:22:50] <$spardanwarrior> Yes
[1:22:52] <yendoria> YES
[1:22:53] <Ner234> YES
[1:22:53] <KitsuneManami> YesSssSss
[1:22:54] <+zinris> gunlance is op
[1:22:55] <+Vigonept> YEAH
[1:22:56] <AllenDeadman> BIG YES
[1:22:56] <Goldenwolf98> Gunlance make big boom
[1:22:57] <+Vijuani> im having fun with it
[1:22:57] <+HelloImTom08> sort of
[1:22:59] <+zinris> like actually op
[1:22:59] <zenith0111> HELL YEAH
[1:22:59] <@SSaryn> Ye, but Long is still easily the best.
[1:23:00] <+IncredibleMeh> gunlance has a goddamn guard point
[1:23:00] <AGood_Noodle> Very much so
[1:23:01] <Oleam458> Disgustingly so
[1:23:01] <+Vigonept> ITS STRONG
[1:23:02] <GreatPowerfulOz> did they? lol
[1:23:02] <+zanzibar_junker> Big yes
[1:23:03] <startstoprepeat> gunlance got mines.
[1:23:04] <+OrangePancake20> yes expenetially
[1:23:04] <warmnoid> poke poke slam boom boom
[1:23:04] <%mordred_t> Gunlance didn't need improving.
[1:23:04] <Gato_Explosivo> Gunlance is fun AF now
[1:23:04] <Shishi1205> gunlance is pretty good now
[1:23:06] <+HelloImTom08> i want to like gunlance but im bad at it
[1:23:09] <malesin_01> long shelling.jpg
[1:23:09] <duskrush> How did he get this early?
[1:23:10] <zenith0111> GUNLANCE GOT THE CHANGES IT DESERVES
[1:23:11] <%Agami23> gunlance got some new stuff. normal lance got barely anything, as it is already perfect
[1:23:11] <%mordred_t> It was already fucking good.
[1:23:15] <%anticrust> Fuck YOu GUNLANCE
[1:23:16] <alwayspronking> Kind of. Unique weakpoint makers
[1:23:16] <Tucker0603> I've been told it's stupid strong
[1:23:18] <yukichocomilk> I hate gunlance
[1:23:18] <xeros720> yeah, i love gunlance
[1:23:19] <+justianxix> Big boom gunlance
[1:23:20] <Aydarkzero> @Ipsenscastle takes some practice but i get what you mean
[1:23:22] <Nested_Dreams> Nutlance Kreygasm
[1:23:23] <SGrim> Gunlance was great. You're just a coward!~
[1:23:24] <+l33t_j4gu4r> gunlance <3
[1:23:26] <%DedlokPM> @duskrush capcom gave him a code
[1:23:26] <%xemnahort> @angriestpat you should see what was added to lance
[1:23:28] <+mechslayer71> At least it’s better than the lance OMEGALUL
[1:23:31] <%Mekhet09> It depends on what you want to do.
[1:23:32] <xeros720> mines sound great for dealing with faster monsters too
[1:23:36] <moistborne> wait how did they change gunlance?
[1:23:44] <$FluffiTamamo> Wyvernblast stake makes gunlance fucked strong
[1:23:45] <+Vigonept> stake
[1:23:45] <KitsuneManami> @AngriestPat I'll trade you my Spaghetti sausage for your early code
[1:23:51] <jcflyguy> Hey, don't knock my Lance :(
[1:23:52] <Oleam458> adding slinger ammo to your shell makes it embed into the monster
[1:23:53] <+l33t_j4gu4r> wheres big fist gunlance???
[1:23:57] <%mordred_t> You can load your slinger ammo into your Wyvernstake.
[1:24:00] <%Venicilia> Welp, have fun learning my main weapon since MH Tri on Wii, gotta go to a friend's christmas party o/
[1:24:01] <+Vigonept> dead cause japan
[1:24:02] <+zinris> remember you gotta CAPTURE
[1:24:02] <xeros720> you can wyvernblast the stakes now? that's fuckin awesome
[1:24:09] <Gato_Explosivo> You can load up your wyvern stake with slinger ammow and basically have it STICK to monsters. Then every time to shell on it it'll explode the monster more
[1:24:10] <Oleam458> after blasting the shell with any explosive it detonates again for extra damage
[1:24:12] <zenith0111> @moistborne More reward for shelling. Because originally shelling was actually non optimal now itbis
[1:24:13] <$FluffiTamamo> Big fist lost to eagle CB
[1:24:14] <Ner234> No Paige
[1:24:16] <KitsuneManami> LUL
[1:24:17] <%radda343> are the moveset changes in the base game or just the xpac?
[1:24:21] <fruit_pie_the_magician> @AngriestPat Gunlance jams a big explosive thing into the monster now. Like, another, bigger, more fucked up one
[1:24:27] <%Aleate> Don't give in to Pats threats ruuMad
[1:24:30] <+Vigonept> its in base now
[1:24:31] <%DedlokPM> @AngriestPat I will give you my apatWhat for an early code. rooAww
[1:24:31] <Shishi1205> and eagle cb is not good enouugh
[1:24:34] <zenith0111> @radda343 Xpac
[1:24:39] <%mordred_t> This enhanced wyvernstake is an exlosive mine that's embeded into the monster, and will exploe every time it is hit by an explosive attack like your shells.
[1:24:41] <xeros720> pilebunkers are the sickest shit man, i swear
[1:24:45] <$FluffiTamamo> Looks fucking cool tho
[1:24:45] <zenith0111> Liar ^^^^
[1:24:47] <nichos7> It's very tight timing
[1:24:47] <%UhneekAnieke> Just xpac
[1:24:47] <%Ipsenscastle> is spaghetti sausage a sausage that was in some spaghetti, or a sausage made out of spaghetti
[1:24:52] <%fatally_furious> @radda343 all weapons got buffs, Clutch Claw is sick, Charge Blade is playable
[1:24:57] <%mordred_t> The damage of the explosion effects the damage of the mine.
[1:25:03] <Psyramics> Its sausage that is threaded onto spaghetti

[1:25:19] <+keyoray> fun
[1:25:20] <%fatally_furious> @remery_ its called the Lance
[1:25:27] <%XzileGaming> @Remery me too, not that gimmicky glaive either
[1:25:29] <%xemnahort> @remery_ it does it’s called lance
[1:25:29] <KitsuneManami> @Ipsenscastle Spaghetti with Sausage instead of beef
[1:25:34] <+mechslayer71> Carting to Bambara LUL
[1:25:36] <+Remery_> a lance is not a spear
[1:25:38] <zenith0111> @remery_ Lance and Insect Glaive are pretty much what you're describing
[1:25:40] <Jack_Nightshadow> Lance and Insect Glaive would be the closest for a spear user.
[1:25:43] <+zinris> CAPTURE QUEST by the way
[1:25:46] <KitsuneManami> OUCH
[1:25:46] <lyzejag> Gottem
[1:25:48] <jcflyguy> Lance is king
[1:25:48] <Mortal_Wombat_I> Remember to clutch more pat, his slinger thorns are busted
[1:25:52] <olgafl0w> pat pat pat of da jungle watch out for da tree
[1:25:57] <KitsuneManami> @AngriestPat take a Cool Drink after that
[1:25:58] <warmnoid> i wonder if they'll bring over tonfas and magnet spike to the mainline games now that Frontier is ded
[1:25:58] <zenith0111> @remery_ Well how different would a spear be in this game?
[1:25:59] <Jtf374> i wish worlds would have a gauntlet class. the smash attacks of a hammer, but the item mobility of a Sword and shield
[1:26:02] <%fatally_furious> @remery_ its a stick you poke monsters with, if you want a Dragoon you can play Glaive
[1:26:02] <%Ipsenscastle> @KitsuneManami ahh. I'd call that sausage spaghetti
[1:26:10] <+mechslayer71> Wall bounce them at at every opportunity pat @angriestpat
[1:26:13] <KitsuneManami> i said it backwards yea lol
[1:26:13] <Shishi1205> you see that yellow eye? Launch that bitch into the wall
[1:26:21] <%Ipsenscastle> haha
[1:26:29] <+machshop> i wanted to like toukiden so much
[1:26:31] <Finaldragoon> MH Frontier Z had Tonfas, but that game recently shut down
[1:26:39] <Nested_Dreams> RIP Frontier and its tonfas
[1:26:43] <%xemnahort> @shishi1205 pat does not yet understand the power of the claw yet
[1:26:45] <Tucker0603> tokieden 2 is fun, though kinda repetitive
[1:26:47] <katocrimson> nergi dual blades are basically claws
[1:26:48] <%XzileGaming> the Tonfas were pieces of shit
[1:26:50] <+zinris> time for WALL SPLAT
[1:26:53] <%fatally_furious> there really should be a fast blunt weapon to match swords
[1:26:55] <+Remery_> @fatally_furious a mix between sword and shield and insect glaive, just fancy ground combos. Lance is really boring
[1:26:55] <zenith0111> Tonfas ie just better dual blades
[1:26:56] <KitsuneManami> @AngriestPat Liking that Mobility?
[1:27:00] <%fatally_furious> like the tonfas
[1:27:04] <Theoyveyman> @angriestpat opimions on the Frontier now that it's gone
[1:27:05] <nichos7> Don't forget to sheathe after the combo

[1:27:50] <%mordred_t> PICK UP THE SHINIES.

[1:28:04] <alwayspronking> NOW SHARPEN
[1:28:06] <Shishi1205> sharpen
[1:28:12] <katocrimson> u can sharpen while on it
[1:28:12] <%UhneekAnieke> I love how they made switch axe more capable in just axe form, very satisfying
[1:28:12] <Oleam458> I believe Capcom said they would rush out the Console patches relatively quick so PC and Console can run concurrent events
[1:28:16] <Ner234> PogChamp

[1:29:39] <Swish19XX> There's also a little skull on the minimap
[1:29:41] <Shishi1205> you have traper
[1:29:41] <Mortal_Wombat_I> Might have to use a pitfall since Elmo’s been building up its immunity to shock traps
[1:29:41] <zenith0111> No
[1:29:43] <%xemnahort> @xeros720 it’s icon has the skull it’s totally limping
[1:29:47] <%XzileGaming> tranq him before
[1:29:54] <%Aleate> If you look at the heart beat monitor in the bottom left, the lower it is, the weaker the monster is :)
[1:29:56] <KitsuneManami> Like that Mobility on LS?
[1:29:57] <xeros720> oh wow, they just tell you now?
[1:29:59] <alwayspronking> Clap
[1:30:04] <+zinris> you can tranq them BEFORE trapping
[1:30:08] <xeros720> so much for the tranq skill or whatever

[1:30:15] <%Capta1n_H3nry> DON'T HURT THE GOOD BOI
[1:30:21] <zenith0111> @xeros720 There have always been ways to identify monster health
[1:30:25] <Theoyveyman> BANBARO
[1:30:34] <xeros720> oh i know, but there was that one skill to made them blink on the map
[1:30:36] <zenith0111> @xeros720 even in older titles
[1:30:37] <%xemnahort> @zinris yes but if it’s not asleep then you might as well wait to be accurate
[1:30:43] <%Agami23> double intimidator, pretty good if your going for a stealth build

[1:31:24] <Shishi1205> double
[1:31:30] <Mortal_Wombat_I> @aleate If I recall correctly that’s actually it’s energy, not health. When it’s exhausted it’s rate will drop, when enraged it’ll spike. The only way to tell health is when it’s limping or when you have good research and the skull icon appears
[1:31:30] <%fatally_furious> enough for a sequel
[1:31:32] <b1gboss007> swaxe also got a Lot of buffs
[1:31:36] <+justianxix> I'll miss serious handler when she's gone
[1:31:41] <+Vijuani> late game is a lot of grinding
[1:31:44] <@SSaryn> Yep.
[1:31:46] <Theoyveyman> MHW 2
[1:31:50] <StandStab> how far are we into this?
[1:31:51] <%Ipsenscastle> for real
[1:31:52] <Shishi1205> last quest is 200 Mr
[1:31:52] <%Piemen99> That's crazy
[1:31:52] <MiskatonicAlum> its a very good expansion
[1:31:55] <zenith0111> If not more
[1:31:56] <@SSaryn> Sounds about right.
[1:31:58] <+HelloImTom08> i still dont like the end game tho
[1:31:59] <+OrangePancake20> Iceborne is almost basically a sequel to the base game
[1:32:04] <KitsuneManami> is Mama Chef Elmo's Mom?
[1:32:07] <%fatally_furious> now its a slightly improved shit slog
[1:32:08] <MiskatonicAlum> it was worth the wait
[1:32:09] <yendoria> Its a sequel disquised as DLC
[1:32:09] <SilverFaustX> its 40h + fashion grinding
[1:32:11] <+l33t_j4gu4r> what's the endgame?
[1:32:11] <+HelloImTom08> Savi is cool tho
[1:32:18] <Ner234> Wiggle wiggle
[1:32:18] <+vaporousTippler> So is this finally a good time to take another crack at it on PC? I never got too far the first try.
[1:32:23] <AGiantPineCone> guideing lands is kind of a shitslog though...
[1:32:28] <%dekkitout> Are augmentations still a chore to get?
[1:32:28] <ShlickityShlim> Slinger burst is op with GS
[1:32:37] <KitsuneManami> is Mama Chef Elmo's Mom? :D
[1:32:38] <alphonseisbest> what is the end game now?
[1:32:39] <%SlashHabit> Thats blue pat
[1:32:41] <Zebroneath> That is accurate. Endgame grind is still not the best, though.
[1:32:43] <Swish19XX> Looks like I'm gonna check out some Longsowrds now
[1:32:47] <Shishi1205> augmentations are now guiding lands materials
[1:32:50] <+HelloImTom08> yea guildlands sucks to grind even with all the changes, not interested in it
[1:32:51] <+Ondartyr> How is the endgame better?
[1:32:57] <Mister_McDerp> blurple

[1:36:16] <viridianowl> Those eyes tho

[1:36:23] <+PatchworkSquid> let's place bets now
[1:36:24] <Finaldragoon> bring back Sand Barioth
[1:36:25] <shardlab> He got the same treatment as Dante in DMC5
[1:36:36] <Xiangchang> He's not super fun to fight with a Bow. The feels.
[1:36:46] <%UhneekAnieke> Barioth gave me such a hard time my first few times until I understood his movements hahaha
[1:36:46] <Shishi1205> pat tenderize

[1:37:34] <%ChaosAethr> @AngriestPat Is this Where Capcom told you not to progress further on stream?
[1:37:43] <Shishi1205> pat use your clutch claw to tenderize
[1:37:48] <alwayspronking> oh yeah, Barioth 1 takes some doing
[1:37:49] <%ChaosAethr> ok
[1:37:49] <+Remery_> Ring Out, Elmo
[1:37:59] <%UhneekAnieke> When I discovered the ice you're fighting off can break off at the edge, I was done.
[1:38:01] <zafooru> Is this just an ice dragon with a cat face?
[1:38:02] <yourliteraldog> My breathing happens through my skin.
[1:38:02] <Theoyveyman> Mount music is one of the best additions to the game
[1:38:12] <lyzejag> YEYE
[1:38:13] <zenith0111> Capcom controlling us?
[1:38:17] <xeros720> your early pc copy has a freaking limit despite it being on console for months?
[1:38:17] <%skizzuto> YEYEYEYE
[1:38:18] <yourliteraldog> Regret your words and deeds
[1:38:19] <+jay521> if the game is out what's stopping you from just streaming it normally
[1:38:19] <Mortal_Wombat_I> Remember Pat, the key to this guy is breaking his wings and tail, so he can’t maintain balance while rushing around
[1:38:24] <lyzejag> AGAIN
[1:38:25] <%Verd_254> why are they worried about content progression when this is just a new platform release?
[1:38:26] <GMKGoat> Nice TCS. Too bad the face wasnt tender
[1:38:26] <kozboz96> @AngriestPat but the games been out for months on consoles are you really spoiling anything past this?
[1:38:26] <Shishi1205> you are better using the slinger burst into tcs off the bat
[1:38:27] <katocrimson> use your slinger true charge combo
[1:38:28] <KitsuneManami> DENTAL WORK
[1:38:34] <Shishi1205> he is angry
[1:38:39] <Shishi1205> red eye on the map
[1:38:39] <%Ipsenscastle> maybe forge some armour?
[1:38:39] <xeros720> corporations are just so dumb sometimes
[1:38:40] <+Spice_bubble> Cant wallbang while they're raged
[1:38:41] <+toficque> he mad
[1:38:42] <%mordred_t> Too angery to flinch.
[1:38:42] <%ThatOneGameTester> i'm really happy this series is getting such good attention now, it was always really niche
[1:38:42] <Ner234> he mad
[1:38:49] <Lostinafantasy> Doesn't work when entaged
[1:38:53] <+OrangePancake20> nulberry
[1:38:55] <+zinris> doesnt work when ANGERY
[1:38:55] <%Teintstein> hoe's mad
[1:38:57] <$spardanwarrior> Enraged. Can't yeet them when they're enraged
[1:39:00] <+keyoray> okay, so i guess I should buy this game. looks amazing.
[1:39:01] <startstoprepeat> @AngriestPat if they have yellow in their heartbeat in the bottom left, they can't be flinch shot
[1:39:03] <xeros720> i don't remember his ice breath tornadoes
[1:39:06] <zenith0111> Pat forgot how to play BabyRage
[1:39:26] <%Taisuru> Time it dummy

[1:39:34] <Gato_Explosivo> temporal mantle
[1:39:34] <Shishi1205> yeah you need to use it when you have an opener

[1:39:43] <%Ipsenscastle> you don't need rocks to clutch, just to flinch shot
[1:39:45] <+zinris> '
[1:39:47] <yourliteraldog> Monster Hunter and Bad Dragon should do a Cross Over Promotion.
[1:39:48] <Shishi1205> or when he is not angry
[1:39:56] <+zinris> you have the mantles to usue
[1:40:01] <+mechslayer71> Rocksteady and temporal mantles for CLutch claw @angriestpat
[1:40:01] <%dekkitout> @yourliteraldog Here here!
[1:40:02] <zenith0111> @angriestpat if you don't claw him you lose out on 50% of your dps
[1:40:05] <Mortal_Wombat_I> Oh crap yeah can’t use the clutch shot when he’s angry
[1:40:06] <%Taisuru> Hit B aft-er grabbing on to flinch them. There's a cooldown on it but it helps
[1:40:08] <Shishi1205> you know who is no fun to clutch? rajang

[1:40:12] <Aydarkzero> lucky Pat!

[1:40:16] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat the timing is legitimately hard but you can do it in between staggers... but I'd recommend waiting for the staggers anyway

[1:43:45] <Shishi1205> he is enraged

[1:44:26] <Ralfclogs> @angriestpat are you going to talk about it on the podcast?
[1:44:26] <%Agami23> surprised you didnt go for the wound
[1:44:29] <Psyramics> He's on an SSD, load times are practically nonexistent
[1:44:35] <@ThePlotHole> Yeah you wanna bust a wing, if you remember how that fucks him in 3U
[1:44:51] <%Intersceptre> Pat, Greatsword has an easy way to TCS when you have slinger ammo now btw
[1:44:53] <%Ipsenscastle> that never stopped you before
[1:44:53] <%Taisuru> I wish woolie gave a fuck about anything that isn't fight games
[1:44:55] <UchiVsTheWorld> LUL
[1:44:56] <%D00msDayDan> oh so it's like a fighting game
[1:44:56] <Swish19XX> Just say judgment slash
[1:44:58] <Shishi1205> tell woolie the new rajang event armor gives buff girls abs @AngriestPat
[1:44:58] <%dekkitout> And then 2 and a half hours of Star Wars talk?
[1:45:01] <%radda343> you tried to get through to him. You even spent half an hour on the basics of item management. It's his fault at this point.
[1:45:01] <Calek> Woolie: Can't hunt with a dog though and that's dumb
[1:45:02] <xeros720> "woolie, you have to level up"
[1:45:04] <+zinris> like that ever stopped you
[1:45:05] <+griffball13> is it like a fighting game or...
[1:45:22] <+OrangePancake20> Woolie: that's cool....but fighting games those
[1:45:23] <Lostinafantasy> Can't wait for TROScast
[1:45:29] <Aydarkzero> oof
[1:45:29] <Shishi1205> thats for reggie
[1:45:34] <%king_wragles> FIGHTING GAMES
[1:45:35] <Tucker0603> I love woolz, but man sometimes
[1:45:39] <+zinris> very COLD
[1:45:43] <Essixian> >Meowster
[1:45:43] <yourliteraldog> "It's like meter"
[1:45:55] <Shishi1205> just show him buff girls
[1:45:55] <arbeh> Barioth's eyes creep me out
[1:45:57] <Aydarkzero> nice
[1:45:58] <Treuan> Nice
[1:46:00] <Shishi1205> neat
[1:46:01] <lyzejag> YEAH
[1:46:02] <+OrangePancake20> Is there a monster hunter fighting game> Woolie would like that
[1:46:06] <Shishi1205> now for the claws
[1:46:10] <%D00msDayDan> H I T S T O P
[1:46:17] <Aydarkzero> @arbeh is it cause they look like the night king dude from GoT?
[1:46:19] <shardlab> That's just the arena
[1:46:21] <%Intersceptre> The claws oughta go first, thats the secret
[1:46:21] <+Vigonept> marvel vs capcom
[1:46:29] <Ner234> he mad
[1:46:34] <Aydarkzero> big mad
[1:46:35] <%Mekhet09> Pat when did you get out of fighting games?
[1:46:39] <Shishi1205> they get flinched if they run into the black spikes
[1:46:39] <Ner234> Fuck yo tail
[1:46:43] <alwayspronking> Clap
[1:46:43] <prime_name> corner traps!
[1:46:44] <Ner234> COWARD
[1:46:44] <zenith0111> What's the difference on PC? Just content?
[1:46:50] <Shishi1205> elmo mvp
[1:46:54] <arbeh> @Aydarkzero Something about the face shape and glow just make him look eerie, hard to describe
[1:47:09] <%DedlokPM> @OrangePancake20 it's called Marvel Versus Capcom Infinite. woolieDATTEBAYO
[1:47:15] <Tucker0603> tenderize those wings
[1:47:17] <%Ipsenscastle> To give Woolie hid due, he does try to be a variety streamer. You can sense he doesn't have the passion for much outside of a narrow sphere though
[1:47:17] <shardlab> You have to soften them up before you can do any good damage
[1:47:18] <Aydarkzero> @zenith0111 pc version is more frames and stability but content is delayed capcom is trying to get them both on the same page for release
[1:47:21] <+toficque> better loading times
[1:47:26] <Shishi1205> he used to be creepy in tri when caves needed torch and you could only see his eyes
[1:47:26] <+zinris> for the hard parts like the wings, do the CLUTCH claw attack so you do more damage
[1:47:28] <+Tonku_the_Red> @n
[1:47:28] <+toficque> content is the same
[1:47:36] <Aydarkzero> @arbeh yeah i wouldn't want to see one of them in the dark
[1:47:47] <Shishi1205> btw with temporal clutch clawing is free
[1:47:50] <Shishi1205> abuse that shit
[1:47:51] <zenith0111> @aydarkzero I couldn't tell ot was PC until he said so LUL
[1:47:52] <+Tonku_the_Red> @zenith0111 PC is behind on content but the game runs and looks way better
[1:47:59] <+toficque> maybe mods but I don't cate for those
[1:48:14] <%DomPressesButtons> break him
[1:48:15] <%xemnahort> @angriestpat when you clutch claw a part and then use y to attack that part takes more damage til it recovers
[1:48:18] <Country_Girl__> apatWink
[1:48:24] <yourliteraldog> It dosen't bleed can we kill it
[1:48:24] <%Intersceptre> someone needs to badger Pat about tenderizing with the claw for real
[1:48:27] <Lostinafantasy> Love those new GS hit effects.
[1:48:28] <yourliteraldog> STAGE #
[1:48:28] <zenith0111> @aydarkzero I thought he just didn't do Iceborne yet LUL
[1:48:32] <+zinris> yeah you're doing REALLY good
[1:48:38] <%Faustgesicht> That is an evil hipcheck
[1:48:41] <Aydarkzero> @zenith0111 oof LUL
[1:48:43] <Shishi1205> use your mantles
[1:48:46] <%Intersceptre> I JUST GOT HERE
[1:48:47] <Shishi1205> and abuse it
[1:48:48] <%Agami23> this fight is normally a big roadblock. the main reason your doing so good is because you're kicking its ass
[1:48:54] <+toficque> don't worry bout it
[1:48:57] <+zinris> when you have the MANTLE on
[1:48:57] <+Vigonept> just do it tho
[1:48:57] <yourliteraldog> Do combo
[1:48:57] <%mordred_t> Eh, I think Tenderizing is a waste of time and too risky in singple player.
[1:48:59] <Aydarkzero> just figure it out 4Head
[1:49:01] <%UltraViolet371> these messages are annoying
[1:49:04] <PE4X> flinch shot is imo better than tenderizing
[1:49:06] <%Intersceptre> I will teach you everything apprentice
[1:49:07] <%Ipsenscastle> you can basically spam it honestly
[1:49:09] <Essixian> I've never played or seen anyone play a Monster Hunter game in my life. This shit looks fucking incomprehensible.
[1:49:11] <firewhiskeys> i feel that, though. like 50% of the time i use the clutch claw i get thrown way off.
[1:49:13] <%fatally_furious> use it like the SA command grab
[1:49:15] <%axellogic> You should just be super good already
[1:49:17] <Shishi1205> yes
[1:49:18] <zenith0111> @mordred_t Single player is easy mode. I'm not joking.
[1:49:19] <Mortal_Wombat_I> The temporal mantle makes it pretty much safe
[1:49:20] <Storm_Samurai> Doesn't golden mantle give you free chances to tenderize
[1:49:20] <yendoria> yeah
[1:49:20] <%king_wragles> yEP
[1:49:24] <MiskatonicAlum> you. did it
[1:49:25] <alwayspronking> Yes
[1:49:28] <Tucker0603> ja
[1:49:30] <+Leon_Spencer> you....did it
[1:49:33] <Shishi1205> look at him crawl lmao
[1:49:38] <+ahdurian> get him elmo
[1:49:40] <+richuyo> Tenderized parts look damaged visually
[1:49:42] <alwayspronking> its is, ever so slightly messed up looking
[1:49:45] <alphonseisbest> @agami23 nah Barry is just not as hard as people make out
[1:49:54] <zenith0111> LUL
[1:49:58] <%VashyronM> I see Monster Hunter Elmo is not that different from real life Elmo

[1:50:06] <xeros720> even in videogames, elmo remains a mystery
[1:50:06] <Shishi1205> nice
[1:50:12] <sonofthedeepsouth> DUHMAGE
[1:50:20] <%Ipsenscastle> you did a good job to break its face with solo GS, that's not easy
[1:50:23] <+richuyo> Just make sure not to clutch claw when monster is mad

[1:50:33] <kammerdood> I can see his charge attacks have not improved since Bloodborne
[1:50:33] <Swish19XX> I am rewarded for E N G A G E M E N T. Thank you Twitch
[1:50:38] <ekipan> I think you were doing better before you got pressured into clutch clawing
[1:50:42] <alphonseisbest> @essixian how is it confusing? u hit the thing with sword
[1:50:45] <%Agami23> sick
[1:50:54] <Shishi1205> the fucking shoulder tackle is the greatest thing
[1:51:00] <olgafl0w> only use clutch claw when your mantle is on that way you tender its parts
[1:51:03] <Shishi1205> you can eat even nukes with that shit
[1:51:05] <Graxe_> apatLiz_RD
[1:51:15] <%Ipsenscastle> apatLiz_SG
[1:51:16] <%Agami23> god that hitstop
[1:51:20] <ekipan> I almost feel like the tackle is too good
[1:51:23] <arbeh> that frame stop on hits is so tasty
[1:51:26] <xeros720> starting to find his rhythm here
[1:51:28] <ekipan> it perfectly rounds out the GS moveset
[1:51:37] <+Weeewer> Breaking Barioths wings makes the fight much easier cause it falls down all over the place
[1:51:38] <Shishi1205> angry boy
[1:51:40] <r90thunder> The wiggler helmet lmfao
[1:51:40] <Essixian> @alphonseisbest I mean everything else. The stats, the carving... I'm getting anxiety just from the concept of "You have to defeat the monster in this very specific way or it won't be worth it because your loot will be garbage".
[1:51:43] <+zinris> ANGERY
[1:51:49] <%mordred_t> Hey pat, why don't you take the free consumables from the supply box? Master Rank Quests give you 4 First Aid Med +es, which are free Mega Potions.
[1:52:05] <shardlab> the tracking marker has the heartrate
[1:52:07] <Shishi1205> tip as soon as that bitch is yellow yeet him into a wall
[1:52:07] <katocrimson> The eye icon on mini map will show u if he's rage
[1:52:10] <+zinris> yes there was, the hell?
[1:52:10] <zenith0111> Woohoo the pc release and it's just Iceborne LUL i don't understand the delay
[1:52:11] <%DedlokPM> mogsW_RD There is no need to worry? Why? Because I am here!
[1:52:11] <AGood_Noodle> Yup
[1:52:15] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat if you notice the claw hit doesn't change direction, it's enraged
[1:52:15] <+Leon_Spencer> his arm spikes are fucked so he has no traction
[1:52:15] <Shishi1205> begin the agitator meta
[1:52:15] <+Xalgar> What? You just saw it scream and do things faster?
[1:52:16] <%sporeian94> sporeian94 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months! Pat how does it feel to know The Rise of Skywalker has a good chance of being the highest grossing movie not to pass 1 billion dollars?
[1:52:18] <%Ipsenscastle> oof
[1:52:19] <Treuan> @AngriestPat Had to ballpark it uphill in the snow both ways
[1:52:20] <alwayspronking> 1hp monkaS
[1:52:21] <%dekkitout> Yeah? Back in the old days, you had pisces wyvern hipchecks
[1:52:25] <+Spice_bubble> The dot would turn yellow if you had that one skill
[1:52:25] <%Agami23> pat, they always had tells.
[1:52:29] <Essixian> @alphonseisbest Also, it seems like a game where new players have to spend like half a year trying to play catch-up with veterans.
[1:52:30] <Oleam458> so far, that move has a 100% hit rate
[1:52:34] <+Weeewer> Cat with the clutch flinch
[1:52:38] <studleydoorite> he sounds like Leon in re2 remake when he gets hit
[1:52:43] <yourliteraldog> its fuzzy
[1:52:46] <Mortal_Wombat_I> A good idea is if he isn’t knocked around by your punch, then you should go ahead and soften instead
[1:52:47] <Shishi1205> you're gonna love the tigrex armor set 75% chance for free meal @AngriestPat
[1:52:50] <+Xalgar> Pat, wrong as always, and half of chat, mindlessly agreeing LUL
[1:52:59] <%Crimpson> @AngriestPat For someone who hasn't played this game, which weapon would you say is best for beginners?
[1:53:00] <yourliteraldog> Why dosent the cat use gunn
[1:53:10] <$onlypuppet> Baby fall down flat apatGib_HF
[1:53:12] <%Mekhet09> Pat really needs to learn how to fucking tackle.
[1:53:16] <shoobieredgrave> Tigrex is Bruh man confirmed
[1:53:18] <%xemnahort> @xalgar while the other screams that he’s wrong
[1:53:18] <Oleam458> how is it not limping yet
[1:53:22] <ekipan> who needs gun when you can always have MORE SWORD
[1:53:22] <yourliteraldog> it screem
[1:53:26] <Mortal_Wombat_I> You can also just spam the clutch punch to soften them anyways
[1:53:27] <Swish19XX> Pat has been tackling yo
[1:53:29] <+Weeewer> Apparantly doing clutch claw in the middle of GS charges is a good move
[1:53:30] <alphonseisbest> @essixian u can beat the monster any way u want and still get drops its only if u are gunning a specific part that u need to focus on a body part. plus in world there a bunch of new systems to help lessen the grind
[1:53:30] <zenith0111> Pat would probably love Hammer
[1:53:30] <katocrimson> Tigrex armour is very good mid game armour
[1:53:36] <RDMOOSE> What is with these tiny numbers. ME WANT BIG NUMBERS! ME WANT BIG BOOM!
[1:53:36] <%king_wragles> Ogre GS isn't upgraded
[1:53:43] <+iggynodiggy> use da demon drug
[1:53:44] <Ralfclogs> Pat sponsored by Free Meal. Thanks Free Meal!
[1:53:44] <%xemnahort> @ekipan but who needs sword when you have GUN
[1:53:45] <%Mekhet09> He hasn't been tackle canceling though.
[1:53:46] <Shishi1205> I have seen tigrex support builds chug everykind of buff and mushroom and not waste one
[1:53:54] <+zinris> pat has hit it a lot, but he doesnt do much damage cause his weapons suck
[1:53:57] <bustawof> i still use tigrex even in endgame cuz of free meal
[1:53:58] <Essixian> @alphonseisbest Well, that's a relief. Might get into it someday then.
[1:53:58] <%mield916> Hey Pat. gonna waste these channel points. smeef
[1:54:06] <alphonseisbest> @crimpson longsword
[1:54:07] <Shishi1205> yellow yeet him into the wall @AngriestPat
[1:54:10] <cheesedburgers> Barry is one tough cookie
[1:54:21] <ekipan> barry's just a big kitty
[1:54:24] <shoobieredgrave> is the sound warped for anyone else? is that just the game?
[1:54:27] <%Faustgesicht> apatGib_SA apatGib_SA apatGib_SA apatGib_SA apatGib_SA
[1:54:32] <+Weeewer> The dodges
[1:54:33] <ekipan> sounds normal here
[1:54:46] <luckycloud91> use the flinch now
[1:54:47] <joylent_blue> shoobieredgrave that's a twitch bug, try refreshing
[1:54:52] <Shishi1205> try caping?
[1:55:00] <Nested_Dreams> @shoobieredgrave Might be a low res stream
[1:55:00] <%axellogic> I wabba play it I wan hit big monsta wit big sword with GREAT energy. one day perhaps
[1:55:15] <Oleam458> I've noticed the PC version doesn't have the sligh pause when the Barioth theme loops like it does on console.
[1:55:16] <%sporeian94> This fucker afile
[1:55:19] <Mortal_Wombat_I> You can safely clutch while you’ve got that mantle on
[1:55:25] <Shishi1205> yeah you get no chanche for tcs if you dont run focus
[1:55:28] <+MagicSpells> Did pat get an early code
[1:55:32] <lyzejag> YE
[1:55:38] <SilverFaustX> i hated this monster in the beta, cause of timelimit
[1:55:38] <Essixian> @alphonseisbest Do fights usually take this long though? This seems like a huge slog.
[1:55:41] <Shishi1205> I have seen tigrex support builds chug everykind of buff and mushroom and not waste one
[1:55:42] <ekipan> elmo MVP
[1:55:42] <%JohnAtDawn> LUL
[1:55:44] <zenith0111> @shishi1205 He needed to use the slinger shot in that case
[1:55:44] <+Xalgar> PC version is also still not optimized LUL
[1:55:51] <+mechslayer71> Pat still full charging anything other than TCS after all this time OMEGALUL @angriestpat
[1:55:53] <Shishi1205> yeah he needs the slinger burst
[1:55:57] <katocrimson> go round
[1:55:59] <Shishi1205> go up
[1:56:00] <+zinris> follow your scoutflies
[1:56:02] <ekipan> I started watching in the middle, has he even carted this quest?
[1:56:05] <Shishi1205> from whence you came
[1:56:07] <Tucker0603> around dummy
[1:56:09] <%Ipsenscastle> up and left
[1:56:24] <alphonseisbest> @ekipan noope
[1:56:24] <+Spice_bubble> It still looks cool
[1:56:25] <Aydarkzero> oh dang really?
[1:56:26] <+omegasis> but now there's a better TCS now, if you do a sling burst
[1:56:27] <+jay521> TCS?
[1:56:30] <Shishi1205> still better if not elemental focuse
[1:56:32] <ekipan> true charged slash
[1:56:33] <%D00msDayDan> @Essixian once you get better gear, and better with your gear, and learn the monsters' patterns better fights get shorter
[1:56:35] <zenith0111> @aydarkzero Nerf/Buff
[1:56:41] <+mechslayer71> It still does the most damage
[1:56:42] <AGood_Noodle> TCS= True Charge Slash
[1:56:43] <Aydarkzero> @jay521 true charge slash
[1:56:45] <IminyourBase> so what happened to wyvern ignition? not the big boy it was anymore?
[1:56:52] <+CruxAustralis> why does no streamer use rations or stamina boosting?
[1:56:53] <+zinris> GJ
[1:56:54] <Baarthas> You did it
[1:56:54] <zenith0111> But you should ALWAYS Tcs
[1:56:54] <+mechslayer71> It’s more important to get to that than anything else
[1:56:57] <+CruxAustralis> this actively pains me
[1:56:58] <joylent_blue> buhbuhbuhBUHHHHH
[1:56:58] <%omegasis> omegasis subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months! 
[1:56:59] <%zeroarturia> @Essixian it depends on your armor and weapon set. My set on PS4 I can kill Barioth in 10 mins.
[1:57:00] <Shishi1205> you can always ask you kitty to put the trap btw @AngriestPat
[1:57:01] <lyzejag> I'm kinda sad the hammer (almost) didn't change at all in Iceborne
[1:57:05] <%Ipsenscastle> that's the do it
[1:57:06] <Oleam458> he did, but the cold ate away at his stamina
[1:57:08] <ashe_strachan> ewww english dub voices
[1:57:09] <%skizzuto> skelmeton
[1:57:13] <%xemnahort> @iminyourbase even if it was ice borne outclasses it easily at some point
[1:57:15] <%Piemen99> nice
[1:57:15] <xeros720> nice bone
[1:57:17] <Shishi1205> you can command him
[1:57:17] <%radda343> I love how goofy it looks with the trap texture just plopped onto the ice
[1:57:17] <Aydarkzero> @IminyourBase it's back for ice borne just need a new mats for it
[1:57:17] <shoobieredgrave> What are the chances of a death stranding crossover with MHW? like 90 percent?
[1:57:18] <%Mekhet09> What would they change about the hammer
[1:57:21] <%Ipsenscastle> You did incredibly to beat that first try with GS
[1:57:22] <+CruxAustralis> ew cutscenes
[1:57:22] <+Xalgar> I fucking hate the TCS mechanic anyway, makes GS so unreliable LUL
[1:57:27] <Essixian> @D00msDayDan @zeroarturia Thanks for the info!
[1:57:27] <+jay521> why is he touching steve buscemi's face
[1:57:30] <katocrimson> oh no annoying handler is back
[1:57:30] <IminyourBase> ahh cool thanks @Aydarkzero
[1:57:32] <alphonseisbest> Boooooooo
[1:57:33] <%cvp5127> no go back
[1:57:35] <%Mekhet09> Outside of the awful first hit in the normal combo.
[1:57:36] <azacca_bitter> fack yuu
[1:57:37] <IminyourBase> thanks @xemnahort :D
[1:57:37] <+zinris> hammer has the best clutch claw attack
[1:57:38] <%fatally_furious> @shoobieredgrave giant BB as a monster is not something Sony want
[1:57:38] <%CappuccinoGuil> IT'S THE WIFE
[1:57:38] <%sporeian94> Is that your GF?
[1:57:38] <zenith0111> @mekhet09 It got the least changes same with DB.
[1:57:39] <alphonseisbest> BOOOOOOOOOO
[1:57:40] <Aydarkzero> why does everyone hate the Handler LUL
[1:57:42] <GMKGoat> Oh no send that handler back
[1:57:45] <Lostinafantasy> Hey Pard!
[1:57:45] <%zeroarturia> HEY PARDNER
[1:57:46] <+CruxAustralis> also ew voiceacting
[1:57:48] <Shishi1205> Wigler god cares not for mortals
[1:57:49] <%mordred_t> Why is she wearing yoga pants in the tundra?
[1:57:49] <Kerra192> WAIFU IS BACK @AngriestPat
[1:57:50] <%cvp5127> you can keep her
[1:57:50] <Gato_Explosivo> She's back ruriLewd

[1:57:52] <+Xalgar> Watching the Cutscenes LUL
[1:57:54] <%Mekhet09> Yeah but there's really nothing to change about hammer.
[1:57:54] <r90thunder> The helmet
[1:57:55] <+sixcubit> i do NOT support the handler hate
[1:57:57] <Jack_Nightshadow> Why can't we just keep the serious handler?
[1:57:58] <alphonseisbest> Go back, FUCK U goooo back into hiding
[1:58:02] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> That fucking hat is the right amount of mockery for this.
[1:58:03] <firewhiskeys> i really like the handler, but i still wished i could keep the serious handler
[1:58:04] <%CappuccinoGuil> Handler is precious, you bunch of dummies cryGrump
[1:58:05] <CybertronPrime> Give us Serious Handler back!
[1:58:06] <Tucker0603> much serious
[1:58:09] <Shishi1205> fuck off velkhana
[1:58:11] <%XzileGaming> youre watching the cutscenes wrong
[1:58:12] <%radda343> I don't understand the handler hate
[1:58:15] <Shishi1205> what an annoying bitch
[1:58:15] <%omegasis> is pat using any mods?
[1:58:16] <Cerabret100> Honestly i cant stand the handler anymore, any time she leaves camp i get my shit wrecked saving her ass
[1:58:19] <%xemnahort> If I was the hoonter I would’ve hit that ass way before iceborne
[1:58:20] <%Mekhet09> Outside of making the triangle combo start with an overhead.
[1:58:21] <ekipan> elmo's armor is duper adorbs, by the way
[1:58:21] <GMKGoat> Handler is precious trash
[1:58:23] <+corrosivePaladin> Everyone hates the handler's voice
[1:58:23] <+zinris> hundler is cute, but i like serious handler more
[1:58:26] <%D00msDayDan> tbh i wanna throw both handlers in a volcano and get guildmarm back
[1:58:27] <joylent_blue> she's just way too happy
[1:58:35] <zenith0111> @radda343 It's a meme at this point. Either your in or out
[1:58:36] <%twistingt0rt0ise> Wobble Wobble Wobble
[1:58:40] <+Xalgar> Is this game still a blurry mess?
[1:58:42] <Shishi1205> hey look the vibrations
[1:58:46] <Aydarkzero> no shutup Kappa
[1:58:49] <+keyoray> but my eardrums would freze
[1:58:50] <alphonseisbest> I want the old handler TO DIE and be forgotten
[1:58:55] <%fatally_furious> @xalgar pat turned off volumetrics
[1:58:55] <%Ipsenscastle> handler would be dead by usual MH standards, take this shit seriously
[1:58:56] <%mordred_t> COPYRIGHT CLAIM FOR GOOD VIBRATIONS FILED.
[1:58:59] <Aydarkzero> it's a ice dragon monkaS
[1:59:01] <DraxTD> no oat
[1:59:02] <%DedlokPM> @corrosivePaladin I know for a fact you are incorrect with that sweeping generalization
[1:59:08] <cheesedburgers> Guildmarm overrated guild sweetheart forever
[1:59:15] <Whiteowlsmith> it's the voice + the fact she exists as like a device to spew obvious shit
[1:59:16] <Storm_Samurai> Her annoying enthusiasm and naivete in the field even though she studies monsters all the time make her so irritating
[1:59:19] <Tucker0603> the armor looks sexy too
[1:59:19] <Shishi1205> Are you going to replace handler for Mr X as soon as the event goes online in Pc? @AngriestPat
[1:59:23] <xeros720> some kind of ice dragon?
[1:59:30] <+Xalgar> @fatally_furious Who the hell thought that would be a good idea to have as a default setting? LUL
[1:59:35] <ekipan> she said the damn word! ban the tracker!
[1:59:45] <%GarbageNirvana> Everybody rumored, nobody believed
[1:59:47] <Psyramics> that fuckin hate in the bakground
[1:59:53] <Shishi1205> fatalis
[1:59:54] <%omegasis> I mean, Shaggy was a myth
[1:59:55] <joylent_blue> lmao
[1:59:56] <zenith0111> Ironically Handler is the most talked about NPC despite the hate. :)
[1:59:57] <biomachyna> velkhana i think
[1:59:58] <+keyoray> My head canon is that she's drugged up to be happy instead of depressed.
[2:00:02] <+HelloImTom08> true LUL
[2:00:05] <+ForteBlade> wiggle wiggle
[2:00:06] <%omegasis> Fatalis is also considered Myth as well
[2:00:08] <%fatally_furious> @xalgar same people who had the game run 32 processes at once at launch
[2:00:08] <Lostinafantasy> Fatalis was a myth
[2:00:09] <%xemnahort> One thing I really don’t like is how every monster except xeno’jiiva has always been heard of by someone before even if it’s new
[2:00:09] <+corrosivePaladin> Dont forget the megasnake with hyperbeams and meteors
[2:00:11] <Ted_the_red> that fucking wiggler hat in the background
[2:00:11] <Aydarkzero> i mean i dunno man
[2:00:11] <xeros720> THAT DICK MONSTER IS A MYTH
[2:00:12] <%mordred_t> WHY IS HANDLER WEARING YOGA PANTS?
[2:00:12] <Goldenwolf98> The Platypus is still a myth Kappa
[2:00:15] <+sixcubit> @AngriestPat pat, people can still just make shit up
[2:00:15] <%omegasis> fuck, is Dalamandur considered a myth?
[2:00:16] <+HelloImTom08> theres a dragon than summons tornados LUL
[2:00:16] <Ner234> And a DOUBLE dick monster that shoots poison
[2:00:16] <sonofthedeepsouth> Albisim in Sperm Whales is a thing Paige
[2:00:17] <alphonseisbest> @angriestpat The Back dragons Pat the black Dragons
[2:00:17] <@SSaryn> And a fucking Eldritch Abomination
[2:00:17] <+OrangePancake20> Remember when they thought Kulve was a myth
[2:00:18] <%ThatOneGameTester> fucking khezhu
[2:00:19] <+Tonku_the_Red> I honestly don't understand the hate toward the Handler. She's positive, energetic, and likes to participate. It seems like people hate her just so they won't be left out of the consensus.
[2:00:20] <$spardanwarrior> Fatalis is a myth because if people kenw about it they would freak the fuck out.
[2:00:20] <Shishi1205> He is a dick
[2:00:20] <%mordred_t> IT'S FUCKING COLD OUT.
[2:00:20] <sonofthedeepsouth> ITS A DICK
[2:00:21] <alwayspronking> ohno, not the dick myth
[2:00:23] <Oleam458> lol he is though
[2:00:23] <Storm_Samurai> LIGHTNING UNICORN IS A MYTH
[2:00:23] <Slim_Filthy> No, shh, he is legend. ARISE Ice Chicken!
[2:00:24] <DamnGoodCake> They don't know theyre in a videogame?
[2:00:24] <+Xalgar> @fatally_furious So glad I waited LUL
[2:00:25] <%omegasis> Khezu is a fucking penis
[2:00:28] <xeros720> khezu is more than a dick
[2:00:28] <Gato_Explosivo> There's literally an oozy tar monster that eats gunpowder and spits explosive lasers
[2:00:29] <%king_wragles> KEZU IS A FUCKING CHODE
[2:00:29] <%LaughingCatt> it is a dick moster

[2:00:33] <xeros720> he is dick prime
[2:00:34] <+zinris> you guys all arguing about this guild girls don't know about the YUKUMO CHIEF
[2:00:35] <Aydarkzero> i am a World newbie so i wouldn't know
[2:00:35] <Shishi1205> Khezu is a dick and I love it
[2:00:35] <+ForteBlade> khezu is pretty phalic
[2:00:39] <Mortal_Wombat_I> I guess because no one ever confirmed it with the guild EVER? So people just assumed it wasn’t real?
[2:00:39] <+OrangePancake20> Dalamadur is supposed to be a myth
[2:00:39] <Storm_Samurai> OMEGA DICK
[2:00:40] <%dekkitout> Pat that's not fair-you primed her to the question Kappa
[2:00:40] <+corrosivePaladin> Khezu is not only a dick its armor and weapons are all dick jokes
[2:00:42] <%omegasis> Khezu is the hentai monster
[2:00:42] <%Agami23> bring back the nibblesnarf!

[2:00:57] <ekipan> khezu's theme music is my favorite
[2:00:57] <cheesedburgers> The fatalis, alatreon and dire miralis are considered myths that most people don’t believe exist
[2:00:57] <alwayspronking> OH NOOO

[2:01:00] <r90thunder> The monster isn't real. It didn't destroy half a town. that was just the wind
[2:01:00] <TsunTsuchinoko> tons of Khezu doujins
[2:01:02] <%fatally_furious> Khezu is in fact a penis, even the armor

[2:01:59] <+keyoray> It looks like a silent hill monster
[2:02:02] <IminyourBase> pat is showing paige his dick so he can win an argument
[2:02:05] <Ner234> BRB Music SourPls
[2:02:17] <IminyourBase> just because your dick looks like khezu doesn't mean all dicks look like khezu
[2:02:24] <%Ipsenscastle> thanks for the khezu with tits, google images
[2:02:27] <%xemnahort> zenith0111 said he’s blocking me and I have no idea why

[2:03:05] <+zinris> peepee
[2:03:06] <Shishi1205> he also never sees you
[2:03:06] <yendoria> Khezu is the worst i hate it\
[2:03:07] <+Spice_bubble> The no music is the best part
[2:03:10] <ekipan> I prefer Gigginox anyway
[2:03:10] <%omegasis> he a blind fucking penis
[2:03:12] <%dekkitout> The only one?
[2:03:13] <ekipan> he's coo
[2:03:14] <%Intersceptre> best bit
[2:03:14] <Shishi1205> thats why you get no music
[2:03:25] <%VashyronM> That's cause you are expected to put some Barry White on why you fight it.
[2:03:26] <+zinris> peepeepoopoo
[2:03:29] <+Xalgar> @AngriestPat It's because he's blind and has a sound mechanic
[2:03:30] <warmnoid> the lightning dick chicken never stops screeching
[2:03:32] <%fatally_furious> @agami23 i too want to fight a dodongo
[2:03:33] <cheesedburgers> Only his screams. So many screams
[2:03:34] <zenith0111> UPGRADE EVEN FURTHER
[2:03:38] <%xemnahort> Am I the only one bothered by people saying they’ll block you for no reason
[2:03:39] <%omegasis> @AngriestPat how's the pc port so far?
[2:03:39] <+corrosivePaladin> Khezu has no music because its blind. So it doesnt go into alert like every other monster.
[2:03:47] <%Intersceptre> @angriestpat Read my donos. Merry Christmas you filthy animals.
[2:03:47] <Mortal_Wombat_I> No music so it’s screams can be even more frustrating
[2:03:51] <%PlainSimpleTailor> WhoreFrost???
[2:03:53] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat isn't this the point Capcom said stop?
[2:03:54] <%ThatOneGameTester> ah shit she's back
[2:03:56] <DamnGoodCake> I'm not up to date with monster hunter, wtf is up with pat's tenticle head?
[2:03:56] <%solidousstream> @vashyronm or marvin gaye
[2:03:58] <Mortal_Wombat_I> CorrosivePaladin is correctly actually
[2:04:01] <Aydarkzero> wheres the void elder dragon Kappa
[2:04:02] <Shishi1205> What about Kushala, Oh wait he is just wind now
[2:04:04] <%GarbageNirvana> Kushala Daora isn't technically ice
[2:04:04] <%Mekhet09> Why to sandbag every seen with that stupid hat.
[2:04:06] <@SSaryn> Needed an ice one thanks to Kushala not being that for some reason
[2:04:09] <+zinris> just like DMC, the music is just in the monster's HEAD
[2:04:12] <lyzejag> WESKER
[2:04:12] <Shishi1205> HE IS
[2:04:13] <joylent_blue> one would think that once you start attacking it, it would go on alert, regardless of blindness
[2:04:14] <Whiteowlsmith> wait for real?
[2:04:18] <Ner234> Really? Huh
[2:04:21] <ekipan> focusing on the story was a huge mistake
[2:04:21] <+Xalgar> I skipped literally EVERY conversation in this game unless it was a tutorial LUL
[2:04:21] <Graxe_> DC Douglas, yeah
[2:04:22] <%omegasis> holy fucking shit, I never fucking realized he had Wesker's VA
[2:04:25] <Zeldrick> Yeah, sounds like Wesker as a nice guy
[2:04:25] <%Mekhet09> Way to sandbag every seen with that stupid hat.
[2:04:25] <%Intersceptre> Is heeeeee?
[2:04:25] <%Kiiper> TITLE DROP
[2:04:27] <startstoprepeat> we truly were the iceborne all along
[2:04:29] <$Hommando> The ultimate bio weapon
[2:04:29] <%fatally_furious> @ssaryn it was planned all along, they played us like a damn fiddle
[2:04:31] <Aydarkzero> Wesker monkaS
[2:04:33] <warmnoid> We truly are the Iceborne
[2:04:34] <ekipan> it's still crap, but now we have to sit through it more
[2:04:35] <joylent_blue> oh damn it is wesker
[2:04:36] <CybertronPrime> Oh shit, that is DC Douglas
[2:04:36] <%zeroarturia> Kyurem from the Nouva region has invaded us!!
[2:04:40] <Whiteowlsmith> wow
[2:04:41] <$onlypuppet> He’s got nice ears
[2:04:43] <cheesedburgers> Every single “mystery” in this series is just a big fuckin monster even earthquakes are caused by monsters
[2:04:45] <Finchit> this guy is totally gonna fuse with a monster
[2:04:47] <Shishi1205> The way velkhana uses Ice is so fucking dumb
[2:04:49] <%DomPressesButtons> i can hear it
[2:04:53] <Aydarkzero> the Commander is a cool guy
[2:04:54] <Shishi1205> Like literally dumb
[2:04:54] <%PunishedMercer_> climate change
[2:04:58] <%PunishedMercer_> is the final boss
[2:05:01] <%mordred_t> Commaner is Grigori from Dragon's Dogma.
[2:05:04] <Shishi1205> WhenI heard the explanation I face palmed
[2:05:05] <@SSaryn> Velkhana is pretty powerful, especially against LIVING THINGS
[2:05:06] <katocrimson> papa nier commander
[2:05:07] <lyzejag> How can they be surprised after the base game it's absurd
[2:05:08] <%Intersceptre> Velks ice power is basically magic
[2:05:08] <Graxe_> Wesker died and found himself in Monster Hunter
[2:05:12] <Graxe_> Wesker isekai
[2:05:19] <Zebroneath> It's all about the "environment"
[2:05:21] <Finchit> man this story is dumb af
[2:05:21] <+corrosivePaladin> What helmet thats clearly just your face
[2:05:25] <yourliteraldog> it wiggle
[2:05:25] <+Urdunngurdunn> Hey, @AngriestPat is it worth it to switch to the pc version of Monster Hunter World if I already have a ps4 copy?
[2:05:26] <Ner234> Most Elder Dragons are straight up magic
[2:05:27] <%solidousstream> the answer is always "let's go kill big monsta"
[2:05:32] <Shishi1205> Wait for the Pearl monkey head and the penguin one @adelym0
[2:05:33] <%zeroarturia> When nobody pays attention to him he switches to sunglasses and mutters something about Bioweapons
[2:05:35] <+keyoray> @katocrimson thanks, couldn't pin point the voice just now
[2:05:37] <lyzejag> What the fuck ?
[2:05:37] <xeros720> don't forget about freaking godzilla
[2:05:40] <%Faustgesicht> Velkhana's goal is complete GLOBAL SATURATION
[2:05:42] <@SSaryn> And an Eldritch huge bitch
[2:05:43] <%theodolitejones> but this one is chilly
[2:05:44] <%dekkitout> Wasn't there a Lovecraftian horror monster?
[2:05:44] <Shishi1205> oops wrong @
[2:05:45] <Aydarkzero> but it's the NEW world
[2:05:46] <+corrosivePaladin> Ohman I always forget gooboy
[2:05:47] <AGood_Noodle> And he was awesome
[2:05:53] <joylent_blue> also the walking volcano godzilla
[2:05:53] <%omegasis> don't forget that there's a GIANT SNAKE in 4U that almost caused pangea
[2:05:53] <Shishi1205> Wait for the Pearl monkey head and the penguin one @AngriestPat
[2:05:54] <simulationbard> God I wish I got that far before my DS concked out on me
[2:05:54] <%xemnahort> I’m seriously bothered by someone blocking me for no reason
[2:05:54] <Rshiners> what about the GOD SNAKE in 4u
[2:05:59] <CybertronPrime> Gogmazios?
[2:06:01] <yourliteraldog> your hat is so dumb i love it
[2:06:03] <+Xalgar> omg this story is so unnecessary in a game about grinding bosses LUL
[2:06:06] <cheesedburgers> You fought a mile long snake made of SWORDS
[2:06:06] <+zinris> and a REALLY BIG snake
[2:06:06] <%Faustgesicht> And a LIVING MOUNTAIN
[2:06:10] <warmnoid> I love how the reason no one knew about Gog was because he put everyone to sleep or something
[2:06:13] <shoobieredgrave> WE THE MARINES WILL BUILD A NEW WORLD ORDER WITH METAL GEAR RAY

[2:06:17] <%ThatOneGameTester> What about the lao shen long that takes up most of the map?
[2:06:18] <%VashyronM> If you are always surprised, you never get complacent.
[2:06:19] <Ner234> Snek urgent pls
[2:06:22] <ekipan> next game they should just replace all the hemming and hawing in the cutscenes with dudebro YEAH NEW MONSTER LET'S GO KILL IT GUYS
[2:06:24] <%honeyman18> How messed up is the Monster hunter universe?
[2:06:26] <Shishi1205> Oh yeah 50 boxes for that in Iceborne @AngriestPat
[2:06:31] <%omegasis> @lyzejag it's never not dumb
[2:06:33] <UnfilteredComic> Which one is just made of bones and shoots massive blue death lasers?
[2:06:35] <ekipan> and then you go kill it
[2:06:41] <+Jajanken4> how long is pat aloud to stream iceborne?
[2:06:49] <+Jajanken4> allowed*
[2:06:54] <Shishi1205> Yeah
[2:06:55] <Graxe_> They literally watched a new species being born with Xeno'jiiva and everyone was like, "That thing's gotta go".
[2:06:56] <xeros720> he just has a story limit, which he just hit
[2:06:58] <%ElkRiverDog> I mean old world chroniclers believed in unicorns but thought giraffes were fake
[2:06:59] <%dekkitout> Wide

[2:07:03] <+corrosivePaladin> None. Gunlance is still shit
[2:07:03] <%radda343> the one that is a gun and also a lance
[2:07:03] <%mordred_t> The explosionest.
[2:07:04] <yourliteraldog> In the witcher mission people thought magic isn't real
[2:07:04] <%Intersceptre> Oh no
[2:07:05] <@SSaryn> Long is stiill best, Normal is fine.
[2:07:06] <+Vigonept> long
[2:07:06] <%Ipsenscastle> it's much easier confined to the arena
[2:07:10] <+iggynodiggy> pink rath GL
[2:07:10] <+Xalgar> Is gunlance still shit? LUL
[2:07:11] <%mordred_t> Wide is actually the worst.
[2:07:11] <TsunTsuchinoko> Long
[2:07:11] <%Faustgesicht> Big bang bang stick time?
[2:07:14] <malesin_01> viper tobi
[2:07:16] <Ner234> LUL
[2:07:17] <joylent_blue> LUL
[2:07:17] <%mordred_t> I always hated it the most.
[2:07:18] <%zeroarturia> Do you ever think Monster Hunter will have a TOHO collabration? Imagine having to fight the likes of Godzilla and King Ghidorah
[2:07:19] <+themcnair> sward and shield or bust
[2:07:19] <OuijaTears> thiccc
[2:07:19] <%Flambage> @AngriestPat Use the one that is good
[2:07:21] <+Elky3> the one with a gun Kappa
[2:07:23] <%mordred_t> Normal is my preferred.
[2:07:24] <Whiteowlsmith> the one that does the gun stuff
[2:07:24] <+zinris> RATHALOS
[2:07:25] <Billli11> long with focus skill
[2:07:25] <%Intersceptre> Long is the best and you may as well be HBG'ing
[2:07:25] <+Jajanken4> @xeros720 @xemnahort thank you!
[2:07:28] <Rshiners> who the FUCK is that
[2:07:30] <@SSaryn> Viper is good, Going off of Bazel is good, Barioth is fine
[2:07:31] <%D00msDayDan> the rwby one
[2:07:31] <+xRyansito> rathalos for long
[2:07:36] <%Taisuru> Wide is the worst unfortunately
[2:07:37] <alwayspronking> LUL
[2:07:37] <%Intersceptre> TrashLance
[2:07:39] <%aeravon> A monster you havent unlocked yet has the current best gunlance.
[2:07:40] <+Vijuani> pink rath for rn
[2:07:40] <+zinris> BIG BIG RATHALOS ENERGY
[2:07:41] <cheesedburgers> Rathian GL has never led me astray
[2:07:42] <katocrimson> do u have any artillery jewels?
[2:07:47] <Shishi1205> down
[2:07:47] <Zulrez> pat best gunlance build is go longsword
[2:07:49] <yendoria> Pink rath gunlance is turbo meta for you
[2:07:50] <%dekkitout> Pink Rathian is good for the shoot-poke-shoot
[2:07:53] <zenith0111> PC gaming is overrated. Change my mind BabyRage
[2:07:55] <%Intersceptre> Lance is the best Lance
[2:07:57] <%xemnahort> @ssaryn unfortunately Basel isn’t available yet for him
[2:08:01] <%mordred_t> You want a Bone Gunlance to make into Velkhana's.
[2:08:03] <+PatchworkSquid> pink rathian is literally the best
[2:08:06] <@SSaryn> Ah good point
[2:08:07] <Goldenwolf98> T U R B O
[2:08:08] <Graxe_> Turbo
[2:08:10] <joylent_blue> man i've been holding off on iceborne, but if i watch this for too long i'm gonna get the itch NotLikeThis
[2:08:12] <Gato_Explosivo> @honeyman18 well...there was a big war of elder dragons demolishing an entire civilization because the humans there created mechanical abomination creatures out of the bodies of dozens of dead dragons
[2:08:12] <yendoria> because gold rathian later
[2:08:13] <xeros720> TURBO
[2:08:15] <rumblarrock> health boost
[2:08:19] <xeros720> which is better than normal meta
[2:08:19] <Graxe_> mothma3Moffchamp_RD
[2:08:19] <%omegasis> how much modding do you plan on doing for the pc port later on?
[2:08:19] <CookieCutter007> S P E E D P O W E R
[2:08:22] <Shishi1205> All weapons that end up being gold rathian are meta till safijiiva @AngriestPat
[2:08:23] <+og_lunchbox> Pink rathian is the best on any weapon type if i remember right
[2:08:24] <%aeravon> He's right though. For now, Pink is strong. Poison is nuts in this expansion
[2:08:25] <+Imn0tacop> yo, so my quest has hand tracking now, and I'm never gonna need a controller for my vr again
[2:08:26] <zenith0111> Gold Rath is fucking end game LUL
[2:08:27] <%Ipsenscastle> thats actually a good shout
[2:08:29] <@SSaryn> Yeah Pink Rathian is probably the best Normal early.
[2:08:32] <%dekkitout> Taroth buster water was good for swinging around a big hunk of metal last time I played
[2:08:33] <malesin_01> viper tobi is viable in endgame
[2:08:36] <zenith0111> NORMAL SUCKS
[2:08:36] <%mordred_t> Also, the new Safi Gunlances are kinda the best now.
[2:08:40] <pitsuji> Poison got stupid buffed in iceborn
[2:08:40] <cheesedburgers> Has pat never checked the gun lance tree or is this a new character he got up to Iceborne
[2:08:41] <Graxe_> Huh
[2:08:41] <%Taisuru> ROLLIN ROLLIN ROLLIN
[2:08:44] <%Intersceptre> Gunlance is gross.
[2:08:44] <xeros720> keep on rollin pat
[2:08:45] <@SSaryn> I mean, yeah.
[2:08:46] <%VashyronM> Fred Rose Durst
[2:08:47] <fergit_> time for glasses, old man
[2:08:47] <%mordred_t> Better than even Gold Rathian.
[2:08:47] <%Ipsenscastle> rollin rollin rollin\
[2:08:50] <+Xalgar> Ok Pat :)
[2:08:50] <zenith0111> LMAO
[2:08:52] <@SSaryn> It wants a motherfucking Chainsaw.
[2:08:54] <Whiteowlsmith> After awhile the lance goes limp
[2:08:58] <%ThatOneGameTester> LUL it's not Fred Durst's Gunlance
[2:08:59] <Tucker0603> I prefer wide shelling but it's all up to you
[2:08:59] <%theodolitejones> The health potion is in fact hot dog flavoured water
[2:09:06] <%imadoc91> Safi gunlance is good, I still like my fucking Rajang Funlance the best though
[2:09:07] <zenith0111> BOOOOOOO NORMAL GUNLANCE
[2:09:14] <%xemnahort> I know this chat is super into helping or hindering pats weapon choice but can we focus on the fact that someone blocked me for no reason and it’s freaking me the fuck out
[2:09:17] <%mordred_t> Normal Gunlance is best.
[2:09:23] <%radda343> because gun and also lance
[2:09:25] <%rumtumtugnutz> Turbo Meta is nerd for "UH OH MY VIRGINITY GREW BACK"
[2:09:27] <%WhereIsWill> Fred durst had a gunlance this entire time
[2:09:31] <Shishi1205> gunlance is a big world
[2:09:34] <shoobieredgrave> Blame Maximillian stans
[2:09:34] <@SSaryn> Mainly because Wide is just bad but people who don't think Normal is still good are dummies.
[2:09:35] <%dekkitout> Gunlances are cool that's why
[2:09:36] <PE4X> gunlance is best lance
[2:09:37] <Shishi1205> 1
[2:09:37] <yourliteraldog> its a gun and sword
[2:09:39] <Shishi1205> tier 1
[2:09:41] <Rshiners> 1
[2:09:41] <%king_wragles> Wow, look at all the wide GL users sad about falling behind the meta Kappa
[2:09:43] <@SSaryn> 1
[2:09:43] <DamnGoodCake> BARE FIST YOU COWARD
[2:09:44] <kehnimentu> Cause it stab but also boom
[2:09:45] <%Ipsenscastle> gunlances are the gunblades of gunlances
[2:09:46] <zenith0111> Don't take chat so seriously old man LUL
[2:09:50] <+Vigonept> 1
[2:09:50] <Shishi1205> rip
[2:09:54] <lyzejag> Uh oh
[2:09:55] <+Vijuani> pls i mained GL before Max
[2:09:56] <%mordred_t> I *finally* got a Capacity Jewel thanks to the Steamwork tickets.
[2:09:57] <%Intersceptre> Gunlance is for people who want to look like Chad Real Lancers but have the mind and strats of a toddlef
[2:10:01] <%king_wragles> Dodo armor should have artillery
[2:10:01] <alphonseisbest> @xemnahort dude just get over it, not everyone is gonna like each other
[2:10:01] <Shishi1205> with the zorah set you can go up to 5
[2:10:02] <xeros720> huh, only one, guess you didn't stay at tier 1 long
[2:10:06] <%king_wragles> there's also the Artillery charm
[2:10:06] <cheesedburgers> Normal gunlance is good anyone who says otherwise is a chump
[2:10:17] <%mordred_t> You have 1
[2:10:22] <Shishi1205> those are not goos
[2:10:25] <%mordred_t> Right above Heavy Artillery.
[2:10:25] <%xemnahort> @alphonseisbest but they seemed cool and I don’t like offending people without meaning it
[2:10:27] <%dekkitout> @Intersceptre And? tajC
[2:10:31] <%king_wragles> Wide got SUPER gypt in IB, not gonna lie
[2:10:32] <%imadoc91> I honestly like normal, but Wide is my favorite, fuck long though it isn't fun to play.
[2:10:35] <zenith0111> @cheesedburgers Wide and Long does it playstyle better...
[2:10:39] <%king_wragles> Long is strong but very boring
[2:10:40] <Shishi1205> you can always make the charm @AngriestPat
[2:10:42] <zenith0111> It's sad....
[2:10:45] <%king_wragles> normal is in the middle, as always
[2:10:49] <Gato_Explosivo> Long is good for booom booom booom. Normal is good for slash slam boom. Wide is good for poke boom poke boom poke boom.
[2:10:52] <zenith0111> @king_wragles Lowest...
[2:10:52] <%mordred_t> I dont like either Long or Wide.
[2:10:56] <+mechslayer71> Hope you’re ready to farm safi pat, the GS is best in slot @angriestpat
[2:11:00] <ekipan> GUNCE
[2:11:01] <%D00msDayDan> i have completely forgotten which gunlance does what
[2:11:06] <%mordred_t> I find shells the most fun to use only with Full Burst.
[2:11:12] <%king_wragles> Sure, normal is the lowest if you just forget wide
[2:11:13] <%Intersceptre> Gunces are for dunces
[2:11:18] <zenith0111> Normal is behind on DPS by A LOT
[2:11:38] <%mordred_t> Oh yeah, gods forbid the DEEPS be lower.
[2:11:39] <%dekkitout> Meld the gem
[2:11:40] <Shishi1205> if you have gold tickets spend them @AngriestPat
[2:11:40] <+iggynodiggy> go meld one
[2:11:43] <Whiteowlsmith> couldn't you just meld a gem though?
[2:11:45] <Shishi1205> USeless in iceborne
[2:11:47] <%imadoc91> Is this a just starting out with IB stream or have you played a lot of it on your own?
[2:11:49] <Tucker0603> @angriestpat what is the shading shit in MHW to turn off my game settings reset so I'm trying to fix it
[2:12:03] <zenith0111> @mordred_t They just need to buff normal. Don't need to be a dick
[2:12:07] <knightwingn94> elder melder that shit
[2:12:08] <MiskatonicAlum> go do the dumb steamworks minigame
[2:12:14] <%mordred_t> Long requires a huge amount of skills to actually hit max DPS.
[2:12:28] <MiskatonicAlum> m,
[2:12:28] <Shishi1205> steamworks gives you celestial
[2:12:30] <MiskatonicAlum> nm*
[2:12:31] <zenith0111> @mordred_t Artillery and focus... so many...
[2:12:38] <Mortal_Wombat_I> That steam works mini game gets you so much stuff at endgame
[2:12:41] <%imadoc91> If he hasn't played any iceborne yet I can't wait for him to see how not shit some of the shit monsters that returned are
[2:12:43] <%Ipsenscastle> I'm so glad they made Mutagen meldable, fuck Ancient Leshen
[2:12:48] <Shishi1205> Btw If you help high rank people doing flares you get gold tickets as rewards
[2:12:50] <MiskatonicAlum> mm, during the holiday it can give you golden
[2:12:52] <Gato_Explosivo> missed his chance for unique animation in the steamworks with serious handler FeelsBadMan
[2:12:52] <cheesedburgers> You can get gold tickets easy from helping HR/LR players but I don’t know if you can with the game not technically being out
[2:12:59] <%imadoc91> looking at you Barioth
[2:13:05] <MiskatonicAlum> but, right, PC isnt on the holiday
[2:13:11] <Shishi1205> Yeah handicraft charm needs MR 100+ @AngriestPat
[2:13:12] <%imadoc91> you little shit cat, that is less shitty now
[2:13:19] <cheesedburgers> You can get serious handler at the steamworks at any time it’s just a random chance now
[2:13:21] <%xemnahort> @gato_explosivo serious handler had an exclusive animation?
[2:13:46] <Mortal_Wombat_I> Serious handler has the best animation for the steamworks
[2:13:46] <Shishi1205> you need ghost ore or whatever from tempered elders
[2:14:03] <Shishi1205> it is really good
[2:14:03] <Gato_Explosivo> @xemnahort Yeah. It'll be her in the cutscene instead of normal handler. She also does different stuff like trying to calm all the palicos down
[2:14:40] <%imadoc91> it's wild how good the Jagras MR gear is
[2:14:44] <%Ipsenscastle> can you make any new IB armour?
[2:14:52] <%king_wragles> he's wearing IB armor
[2:14:55] <%Ipsenscastle> Barroth set rocks
[2:14:57] <%king_wragles> .... kidna
[2:14:59] <%Double_Tap_That> but muh DPS
[2:15:03] <Shishi1205> dont worry level 4 decos with handicraft are more common
[2:15:07] <zenith0111> If you're going to do normal style Gunlance focus on attack boost skills.
[2:15:09] <%imadoc91> Partbreaker is under rated don't let anyone tell you otherwise
[2:15:16] <+Vigonept> on normal?
[2:15:17] <%imadoc91> I always like using it
[2:15:18] <zenith0111> ^^
[2:15:32] <Shishi1205> partbreaker is good for story
[2:15:38] <Psyramics> nd yet he never fought KT
[2:15:38] <%king_wragles> part break makes life easier
[2:15:39] <+zinris> instead of focus, put the sharpening jewel
[2:15:39] <katocrimson> poison boomstick
[2:15:41] <Shishi1205> also poison weapons are good on iceborne
[2:15:44] <Ner234> Training area first
[2:15:47] <fruit_pie_the_magician> It's also a "get more shit" boost
[2:15:52] <zenith0111> @vigonept Yes because normal does the most physical damage. When the other styles are article damage
[2:15:52] <Shishi1205> at least in the history
[2:15:55] <cheesedburgers> Part breaker is damn near essential on the new siege
[2:15:55] <IminyourBase> bully this pukei!
[2:15:58] <%imadoc91> Yeah poison is super good with the new hp
[2:16:07] <%Intersceptre> Don't kill Pukei, he's Geralts friend.
[2:16:11] <%omegasis> can get to training area from the map
[2:16:11] <Shishi1205> hit the map
[2:16:13] <%dekkitout> You're using a long gunlance, so you can either A) chain full bust ad noseum or B) spam charged shots
[2:16:14] <zenith0111> @vigonept artillery
[2:16:26] <MiskatonicAlum> new gimmick for GL is loading pods into your wyrmstake
[2:16:29] <@SSaryn> Doubled in potency
[2:16:30] <IminyourBase> the key to the gunlance is to learn to get that short reload
[2:16:33] <+Adventureless__hero> no, training wheels off
[2:16:37] <%Intersceptre> Imagine using Gunlance and duping yourself out of Counter-Claw.
[2:16:38] <Shishi1205> Poison is good because Iceborne monsters have huge HP
[2:16:41] <ashuckel> he's super weak to poison
[2:16:43] <%imadoc91> Monsters have a lot of HP and poison does percent damage
[2:16:54] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Is this the gunlance type withe the massive explosive tag?
[2:16:55] <luckycloud91> you can just use the map to go to the training area
[2:16:56] <zenith0111> @angriestpat Poison is really good if you have the rath set bonus. Otherwise don't worry
[2:16:57] <%dekkitout> Poison makes up for the gaps in dps
[2:16:58] <alwayspronking> Poison is okay, but it depletes monster health without breaking parts so shrug
[2:16:58] <Malikwest11> you can go there from your map Pat
[2:17:01] <MiskatonicAlum> to put a repeatably explodable point on the monster
[2:17:02] <%imadoc91> it scaled better than a lot of damage did
[2:17:03] <%Intersceptre> go pick up slinger ammo
[2:17:08] <Shishi1205> you dont need rathian set bonus
[2:17:09] <+Vigonept> get slinger ammo to do the new move
[2:17:09] <+zinris> most important right now is the SLINGER ammo
[2:17:10] <cheesedburgers> Even monsters not especially weak to poison still take not insignificant damage
[2:17:15] <Shishi1205> poison is just an increase in dps
[2:17:18] <%Shonen_hero> work off that rust Pat, you got this
[2:17:21] <Tucker0603> yep
[2:17:24] <malesin_01> it's good cuz gold rathian weapons have it but blast is better in a bubble
[2:17:25] <zenith0111> @shishi1205 You lose out on 50% of damage.
[2:17:27] <alwayspronking> Yes, rocks are most important for gunlance
[2:17:37] <Shishi1205> you lose more dps if you go for rathian bonus
[2:17:40] <zenith0111> @shishi1205 Maybe even more. since it's duration is doubled.
[2:17:44] <%honeyman18> Finally wrapped up the gumbo, back to moster hunter.
[2:17:46] <%imadoc91> Your slinger is going to be your best friend Pat, it feels gimmicky at first but you'll get used to it
[2:17:48] <Shishi1205> never worth
[2:17:49] <pitsuji> yeah poison is just one of the more optimal ways to quickly get through a monster
[2:17:56] <zenith0111> @shishi1205 Lies and blocking you now
[2:18:00] <+Adventureless__hero> gunlance is best weapon imo
[2:18:00] <%imadoc91> Also don't spam the clutch claw or you're gonna eat shit a lot
[2:18:04] <Shishi1205> unless its safi or final boss
[2:18:06] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat now do a stake
[2:18:08] <%omegasis> you have a guard point throughout that whole animation @AngriestPat
[2:18:12] <Shishi1205> poison is a nice add just that
[2:18:16] <@SSaryn> NICE
[2:18:17] <Shishi1205> Blast is the real winner
[2:18:17] <%king_wragles> AAWWWWW
[2:18:17] <startstoprepeat> whiff
[2:18:18] <%mordred_t> Miss.
[2:18:19] <IminyourBase> pick it up
[2:18:21] <%Taisuru> Not loaded dummy
[2:18:23] <Ner234> LUL Missed
[2:18:23] <+Vigonept> you can combo straight into the stab by pressing trainable and circle after losding the slinger ammo
[2:18:24] <+zinris> wont work here, talk to you CAT
[2:18:25] <alwayspronking> missed D:
[2:18:26] <%Intersceptre> missed it
[2:18:29] <%dekkitout> Spacing is very vital for the spike
[2:18:36] <Shishi1205> Poison buildup is hold up while the monster is poisoned blast buildup no
[2:18:37] <%Intersceptre> like a true brainlet gunlancer would
[2:18:48] <Shishi1205> now bomb that
[2:18:50] <alwayspronking> You can also load that from guard
[2:18:50] <Zebroneath> The special reload has a gueard point
[2:18:52] <%imadoc91> @AngriestPat That load animation has a guard point Pat
[2:18:52] <%Taisuru> Shoot that
[2:18:53] <pitsuji> now shoot it
[2:18:53] <IminyourBase> now what?
[2:18:54] <yendoria> shoot
[2:18:55] <+mechslayer71> Pat doesn’t know the burst combo? @angriestpat
[2:18:55] <%dekkitout> Noe jit it
[2:18:56] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat do the burst on that
[2:18:57] <alwayspronking> now shell it
[2:18:59] <Tucker0603> now shoot
[2:18:59] <%Taisuru> SHOOT IT
[2:19:00] <Ner234> Shell
[2:19:00] <katocrimson> keep shelling it
[2:19:05] <+zinris> hit with the GUNlance
[2:19:06] <OBS_VinnieK> shell it for boom booms
[2:19:12] <zenith0111> NotLikeThis
[2:19:15] <IminyourBase> ohhhhhhh
[2:19:15] <warmnoid> cool roman
[2:19:18] <alwayspronking> YEYEYE
[2:19:19] <fruit_pie_the_magician> DOUBLE BOOMS
[2:19:20] <%omegasis> wyrmfire it for big damage
[2:19:22] <Tucker0603> now BIG SHOOT
[2:19:22] <Shishi1205> use the finisher
[2:19:24] <%Taisuru> Extra explosions from everything
[2:19:27] <zenith0111> YE YE YE
[2:19:28] <%logoth_> now you've got crashmans power
[2:19:28] <alwayspronking> Wyvernfire also works on it
[2:19:30] <IminyourBase> so it's like the spiked pod that does more dmg when you hit it
[2:19:30] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat it scales with the explosion too. add long's charge bonus or normal's burst bonus and it wrecks shop
[2:19:31] <Ner234> More explosions
[2:19:34] <%Taisuru> MORE EXPLOSIONS
[2:19:36] <Shishi1205> extra dmg
[2:19:38] <cheesedburgers> It’s like the LBGs little bomb traps but you stick it in a monsters nuts
[2:19:39] <%xemnahort> Ok since the one who blocked me has blocked another person for stating an opinion I’m less beat up over it now because now I know they suck
[2:19:40] <%omegasis> it does more explosion
[2:19:41] <+Vigonept> that's it
[2:19:41] <Whiteowlsmith> it does its own mini explodes looks like
[2:19:43] <alwayspronking> Its doing extra damamge
[2:19:44] <+Vigonept> its strong
[2:19:44] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat double explosions
[2:19:45] <IminyourBase> @AngriestPat it's does dmg when you hit it
[2:19:45] <Tucker0603> MORE BOOM!!!
[2:19:46] <+zinris> it basically doubles the explosion
[2:19:46] <@SSaryn> You're not, just a lot more explosions and part damage.
[2:19:47] <Mortal_Wombat_I> Hit it with a big boom for a bigger response
[2:19:48] <katocrimson> that mine will remain in monster for a period of time
[2:19:52] <alwayspronking> shells hit twice now
[2:19:52] <%Taisuru> Quite a while
[2:19:53] <Shishi1205> a good bit
[2:19:53] <fruit_pie_the_magician> @AngriestPat You're getting two explosions every time you fire instead of one
[2:19:54] <+zinris> a long time
[2:19:56] <+toficque> depends
[2:19:58] <Ner234> A long time
[2:19:58] <Gato_Explosivo> Depends on the ammo
[2:19:59] <%Cn_alpha_02> It is exploding
[2:20:01] <PE4X> depends on your ammo that you put in
[2:20:01] <kozboz96> @AngriestPat depends on ammo
[2:20:02] <%Intersceptre> depends on ammo used
[2:20:04] <alwayspronking> For a while, depending on amount of stuff loaded in
[2:20:05] <%king_wragles> Depends on how much slinger ammo you put in
[2:20:07] <Shishi1205> yep
[2:20:13] <%Intersceptre> and amount
[2:20:14] <malesin_01> 2-5 min depending on ammo
[2:20:14] <fruit_pie_the_magician> @AngriestPat and also that makes it explode hard
[2:20:14] <Zebroneath> Depends on slinger ammo. 2 and a half minutes ir the usual
[2:20:15] <@SSaryn> Like.. as long as a Charged Insect Glaive.
[2:20:18] <Tucker0603> long time, you can get multiple in if I remember
[2:20:18] <%Shonen_hero> way cool
[2:20:19] <+Vigonept> it didnt used to do that explisons on the spike
[2:20:25] <zenith0111> @angriestpat Pretty long time depends on ammo. Slinger capacity is recommended if you like the stake
[2:20:31] <+toficque> reload after the sweep
[2:20:39] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat that works with ANY explosion. Bomb pods, sticky ammo, etc. Not sure about blast procs
[2:20:44] <bustawof> having 4 people using GL is great
[2:20:49] <+Vigonept> quick reload
[2:20:51] <IminyourBase> quick reload is key to gunlance
[2:20:57] <+iggynodiggy> sweep slam boom reload
[2:20:57] <UnfilteredComic> just increases dps
[2:21:04] <Shishi1205> ye
[2:21:08] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat but not stakes
[2:21:08] <+Vigonept> all shells
[2:21:09] <@SSaryn> Ye.
[2:21:11] <Mortal_Wombat_I> Lots of extra damage/part break if I remember correctly
[2:21:12] <zenith0111> Slowest Combo in the game BabyRage
[2:21:12] <UnfilteredComic> big buff
[2:21:13] <%Intersceptre> all shells, no stake
[2:21:14] <%D00msDayDan> quick reload won't reload the wyrmstake though
[2:21:15] <%Taisuru> That's the dps combo
[2:21:16] <alwayspronking> YES BIG BOOM
[2:21:17] <%dekkitout> Chain fullburst with quick reload
[2:21:17] <+zinris> SLAM > BURST > SWEEP > RELOAD
[2:21:17] <+Vijuani> KID WANNA DO AN INFINITE
[2:21:23] <fruit_pie_the_magician> @AngriestPat The changes mostly amount to "big tag you stick to monster blows up constantly while you attack"
[2:21:27] <%dekkitout> It shits out your sharpness though
[2:21:29] <$FluffiTamamo> @zenith0111 I’m not too sure Slinger cap affects it. Isn’t time based on percentage of remaining ammo?
[2:21:38] <cheesedburgers> GUNLANCE FUNLANCE BABY
[2:21:38] <%xemnahort> @vijuani yes that’s why I use lance
[2:21:43] <IminyourBase> you ever heard of an infinite combo? YEAH DO COMBO
[2:21:46] <zenith0111> @fluffitamamo Which is why slinger capacity helps
[2:21:59] <%Intersceptre> Where are my true Chad actual Lance users?
[2:22:00] <%omegasis> so weird seeing a created character with hair for pat
[2:22:01] <%Shonen_hero> Is that headgear or is that like a race?
[2:22:03] <alphonseisbest> OMFG she suuuuck solo much
[2:22:03] <%king_wragles> I should get stonethrower....
[2:22:06] <Storm_Samurai> LUL
[2:22:07] <Theoyveyman> @angriestpat If you thought Xeno was Shin Goji, you should see Safi
[2:22:07] <katocrimson> this is HR Gunlance right? won't a basic MR one be better
[2:22:13] <UnfilteredComic> SourPls
[2:22:15] <alphonseisbest> I miss serious handler
[2:22:21] <%mordred_t> This is the first MR Pink Rathian Funlance.
[2:22:24] <zenith0111> @katocrimson Yes LUL but no since it's Gunlance
[2:22:26] <$FluffiTamamo> @zenith0111 No, I mean having 20/20 rocks is the same as having 45/45
[2:22:28] <Shishi1205> you should have the double ice fish event for the swordfish
[2:22:28] <%rumtumtugnutz> @Shonen_hero Its a headgear
[2:22:29] <%mordred_t> Royal Burst +
[2:22:32] <Ner234> @Intersceptre I don't main Lance but good Lance gamplay is inspiring
[2:22:32] <+Spice_bubble> "The fire"
[2:22:37] <%Shonen_hero> okay cool thanks rumtum
[2:22:38] <%king_wragles> @katocrimson the pink rathian one kinda holds up... but not for long
[2:22:45] <SilverFaustX> first thing i did ingame is mute handler
[2:22:45] <Shishi1205> pukei is there
[2:22:47] <%king_wragles> without an IB upgrade that is
[2:22:50] <Shishi1205> Pat turn around
[2:22:51] <%mordred_t> Yeah, not for long.
[2:22:52] <%Intersceptre> >literally next to it
[2:22:57] <Zebroneath> Stays till you whiff or hit
[2:22:58] <%mordred_t> but Gold Rathian is massive powerspike.
[2:23:00] <zenith0111> @fluffitamamo Yes but say if you have bombs or thorn pods. You can now use them safely without losing much DPS
[2:23:01] <ekipan> not really any point to spawning in a random zone any more, now that you can just fast travel to camp
[2:23:06] <UnfilteredComic> can you load flashpods?
[2:23:16] <$FluffiTamamo> Ah
[2:23:19] <+zinris> just pres B 3 times
[2:23:23] <Shishi1205> hey the new cat tool
[2:23:31] <Shishi1205> explosion + flinch
[2:23:32] <%PoonOfChaos> why mute Handler when you can make her speak monster hunter language?
[2:23:44] <Shishi1205> why its the worst one of the all new ones? no idea
[2:23:50] <%mordred_t> No explode that tail off.
[2:23:51] <%omegasis> did they buff the distance you can dodge/sidestep with gunlance?
[2:23:53] <%mordred_t> Now*
[2:23:55] <cheesedburgers> Replace the handler with screeching baboons
[2:23:55] <Ner234> Bad spot but ehh
[2:24:01] <zenith0111> @fluffitamamo Also at max capacity you can flinch shot them and still have ammo leftover
[2:24:03] <IminyourBase> he hit it once so far
[2:24:08] <%king_wragles> I forgot how awkward it looked learning the loop
[2:24:16] <zenith0111> @fluffitamamo That's it's biggest advantage
[2:24:20] <yendoria> You can quick reload after literally any attack
[2:24:23] <IminyourBase> his tail swallowed it lol
[2:24:30] <warmnoid> brap
[2:24:30] <%mordred_t> Pat, with Normal, you only ever use your shells in Full burst.
[2:24:31] <IminyourBase> i do
[2:24:33] <Shishi1205> look at him fart
[2:24:36] <Gato_Explosivo> brrrrrap
[2:24:36] <Ner234> It farted ewww
[2:24:38] <KoyFoster> That's nasty.
[2:24:41] <@SSaryn> I like that it's literally just a fucking raspberry.
[2:24:42] <+iggynodiggy> toxic braps
[2:24:44] <PunkZedB> uh oh stinky
[2:24:45] <bustawof> nice
[2:24:48] <Astaroth130> ive never seen him do that
[2:24:49] <@SSaryn> It's just a fucking raspberry sound.
[2:24:57] <cheesedburgers> Chipotle feels
[2:24:58] <Shishi1205> poor barrot the only one with no new moves FeelsBadMan
[2:24:59] <HyperBomb21> Is Pat gonna play some multiplayer or is this solo only stream?
[2:25:03] <+zinris> normal shot gunlance uses the BURST alot
[2:25:07] <%Intersceptre> he totes does in base game, post scatternut effect
[2:25:11] <+allups> "im not to worried about it"
[2:25:26] <zenith0111> @zinris Handicraft and Polish are recommended.
[2:25:36] <Shishi1205> let him meet the wall @AngriestPat
[2:25:41] <Mortal_Wombat_I> ! PAT AT RISK !
[2:25:42] <zenith0111> Gunlances damage is also based off it's sharpness BabyRage
[2:25:59] <katocrimson> Guard
[2:26:01] <IminyourBase> artillery is the main one
[2:26:05] <Shishi1205> guard and attack
[2:26:05] <kozboz96> guard up
[2:26:10] <IminyourBase> more dmg for shells is best
[2:26:10] <%mordred_t> Slinger capacity is optional.
[2:26:13] <@SSaryn> Guard Up on any Lance is good
[2:26:14] <HyperBomb21> @AngriestPat Most Time Attackers say Artillery is a trap lol
[2:26:14] <+Adventureless__hero> magazine is good too
[2:26:14] <%dekkitout> Just carry around the whetscales
[2:26:16] <alwayspronking> Artillery, Slinger up, Capacity up
[2:26:21] <Theoyveyman> Dude MR Tobi Kidachi is the best
[2:26:24] <+Vigonept> magazines
[2:26:24] <zenith0111> Slinger capacity is just QOL
[2:26:28] <Shishi1205> capacity up is good
[2:26:29] <Billli11> focus for charge shell
[2:26:34] <zenith0111> Magazine is the big one
[2:26:43] <%logoth_> there's a shell capacity gem too, you want that
[2:26:44] <%Intersceptre> Imagine using Gunlance at not having Guard Up as an internal weapon mechanic
[2:26:45] <alwayspronking> maybe protective polish if you got it
[2:26:47] <cheesedburgers> I like offensive guard but that’s just for funsies
[2:26:49] <%DedlokPM> @HyperBomb21 I mean, seeing as he is doing Iceborne stuff on PC and Iceborne is not released for the general player base yet, I assume solo
[2:27:04] <%king_wragles> Artillery, capacity, guard 3(at LEAST) and then QoL's and defensives
[2:27:14] <tigerfang86> OWNED
[2:27:17] <HyperBomb21> Wait I thought Iceborne was out. When is it out on PC?
[2:27:18] <Shishi1205> I love seeing people run gunlance vs safi and breaking all his legs
[2:27:20] <zenith0111> @cheesedburgers Offensive guard doesn't scale with artillery
[2:27:29] <%DedlokPM> @HyperBomb21 January iirc
[2:27:30] <Shishi1205> yep
[2:27:30] <+Adventureless__hero> ThiCC JagRus in the house
[2:27:32] <+toficque> yup
[2:27:35] <HyperBomb21> oh ok
[2:27:49] <%xemnahort> @angriestpat attack was nerfed crit eye is better now
[2:27:53] <ekipan> gat dang
[2:28:11] <%imadoc91> attack is still really good early
[2:28:14] <Shishi1205> attack was not nerfed, on high attack weapons crit is better % wise
[2:28:15] <kozboz96> @xemnahort not for shelling cause shelling cant crit
[2:28:20] <cheesedburgers> @zenith0111 i mainly use it on normal gunlance when I use it as a poke stick, not on gun heavy play styles like wide or long
[2:28:28] <%king_wragles> Crit was buffed, attack was left alone
[2:28:32] <+zinris> what
[2:28:35] <zenith0111> @cheesedburgers Fair enough
[2:28:41] <Shishi1205> cant ask for it
[2:28:43] <Shishi1205> not now
[2:28:45] <HyperBomb21> @xemnahort there are weapons in iceborne that have -30%
[2:28:50] <+zinris> oh thats not until lvl 15
[2:28:51] <Shishi1205> You need level 15
[2:28:51] <%xemnahort> @kozboz96 ah that makes sense
[2:28:52] <%king_wragles> YOU ASKED HIM TO
[2:28:54] <+Adventureless__hero> palicos got nerffed
[2:28:54] <%imadoc91> it's not that it was nerfed it's just a flat amount and crit by nature of being percent based it scaling
[2:28:55] <%dekkitout> There are bomb nets now?
[2:29:09] <%Kongro_> I have never seen that Palico item before
[2:29:11] <HyperBomb21> Yeah the cat will do things automagically
[2:29:12] <%king_wragles> You asked him with your mouth parts!
[2:29:12] <%Intersceptre> Level 15
[2:29:18] <HyperBomb21> Most of the time, they're on pont
[2:29:20] <HyperBomb21> Most of the time....
[2:29:32] <Shishi1205> like every new tool
[2:29:33] <%Intersceptre> You can't command it til 15, it happens at 11 tho
[2:29:33] <+HelloImTom08> iven never seen it either, nobody uses trap palico LUL
[2:29:34] <ekipan> sniped
[2:29:38] <Shishi1205> except the revive one
[2:29:39] <+allups> lol
[2:29:40] <+Scrub_Seeker> sniper puki
[2:29:41] <Shishi1205> thats automatic
[2:29:43] <cheesedburgers> The item wheel is fucking unholy looking when you go into the customization menu
[2:29:46] <+toficque> 60% of time it works every time
[2:29:52] <%Shonen_hero> aw man not the fart gas
[2:29:52] <%imadoc91> Btw Pat there's a set later in the game that gives you 8 levels of attack even though 7 is the cap
[2:29:53] <arbeh> what is that nasty ass sound when he does that
[2:29:56] <+HelloImTom08> sounds like a woopie cushion LUL
[2:30:01] <HyperBomb21> @HelloImTom08 Trap Palico is great for farming points
[2:30:01] <cheesedburgers> He’s farting poison gas
[2:30:05] <cheesedburgers> Out of his tail
[2:30:07] <Shishi1205> the gong is sooo goog
[2:30:10] <Shishi1205> good
[2:30:20] <+Adventureless__hero> love gunlance but only long gunlance method
[2:30:25] <Shishi1205> I never take it off. It can save your ass from supernovas
[2:30:45] <HyperBomb21> Gunlance is okay, i prefer regular lance because of Advancing Guard
[2:30:49] <danknugglit> Pats finally getting into iceborne? PogChamp
[2:30:57] <%Intersceptre> Trap Pali is good for '----- Lands'
[2:30:58] <OlavOlavsson> blue sharpness gunlance is so sad to watch
[2:30:59] <%mordred_t> I find Lance very boring.
[2:31:00] <%imadoc91> Iceborne is finally getting into pc
[2:31:02] <%Faustgesicht> So How's gunlance feeling, Pat?
[2:31:08] <Shishi1205> Im pretty sure there's no bad new weapons anymore
[2:31:24] <katocrimson> the whole gang is here
[2:31:24] <Shishi1205> hey rath, strange seeing you here
[2:31:25] <%Shonen_hero> man it's so rad the monsters fight eachother
[2:31:28] <kozboz96> oh shit its that thing from ff14 Kappa
[2:31:28] <+toficque> you can hop and do it but it's kinda tricky
[2:31:32] <%imadoc91> Gunlance is one of the least changed weapons in the game so it is a good starting point
[2:31:34] <+allups> stick one in his head
[2:31:34] <%mordred_t> Eh, the Velkhana weapons, while pretty, are kinda bad.
[2:31:35] <UnfilteredComic> ouch
[2:31:46] <HyperBomb21> @Shonen_hero Its gets old in iceborne, trust me
[2:31:55] <Shishi1205> btw raths in master rank? huge fuckers
[2:31:55] <alwayspronking> Rath does 70% monkaS
[2:31:57] <+allups> good block
[2:31:59] <Shishi1205> ALways flying

[2:32:20] <IminyourBase> LEAVE THIS POOR LIZARD BIRD ALONE
[2:32:22] <%imadoc91> It's the best thing I have ever felt
[2:32:23] <%Intersceptre> Pukei is Gerakts fren
[2:32:36] <+emperordread> I thought Pukei Pukei was a bitch, but he's still going after a 3v1. Has he been buffed?
[2:32:36] <Shishi1205> he is getting a broklyn
[2:32:37] <HyperBomb21> D:
[2:32:39] <Ner234> Poor Pukei FeeldBadMan
[2:32:42] <HyperBomb21> Stop bullying Pukei
[2:32:45] <+HelloImTom08> he's getting bullied pertty bad
[2:32:48] <%imadoc91> MHW greatsword feels slowweak and dumb compared to iceborne
[2:32:48] <+Merkensteiner> apatWhat_SA
[2:33:03] <+Remery_> I only care for Pukei when someone draws it as a anime girl.
[2:33:04] <IminyourBase> he saw the pukei sack
[2:33:05] <cheesedburgers> Pukei just wanted a quiet life
[2:33:05] <HyperBomb21> Its a reload

[2:34:22] <+HelloImTom08> saved
[2:34:23] <cheesedburgers> pat missing the tail is fucking illegal
[2:34:33] <danknugglit> Tail isnt even worth going back for tbh
[2:34:39] <alwayspronking> I hate when it happens to me. Hopefully, never to you.
[2:34:45] <+Adventureless__hero> use the tail as a gunlance
[2:34:50] <Shishi1205> It gets marked in the map btw, has its own icon @AngriestPat
[2:34:58] <arbeh> There could be ANYTHING in a tail
[2:35:02] <arbeh> even a tail
[2:35:03] <Shishi1205> Just in case you lose track of it
[2:35:09] <danknugglit> Get thoes dank pekei gems LUL
[2:35:14] <ekipan> are there any good joke GLs, like the fish GS?
[2:35:21] <HyperBomb21> You can cook tails for specail items sometimes
[2:35:29] <HyperBomb21> The Oven Roast option at the canteen
[2:35:34] <Shishi1205> he droped a slinger ammo he is near death
[2:35:39] <DreamPhantasy77> plz no kill pukei BibleThump
[2:35:41] <%Intersceptre> @ekipan The fish GS is amazing for story
[2:35:42] <HyperBomb21> Cook Odogaron tails for ez Nourishing Extract
[2:35:44] <Shishi1205> not sure if capable yet tho
[2:35:53] <cheesedburgers> Not carving the tail is like ordering fries with your burger and then not eat the fries you leave them on the ground
[2:35:57] <toyforus235> blast
[2:36:00] <ekipan> "joke" doesn't mean "bad"
[2:36:08] <%imadoc91> You get so many goddamn mantels from tales in iceborne.
[2:36:26] <%imadoc91> always worth.
[2:36:39] <Shishi1205> Try puting the temporal mantle on then clutch clawing his face and yeeting him into the wall @AngriestPat
[2:36:44] <FerwhateverDota> what does pat usually use ?
[2:36:45] <%omegasis> heat guage was a thing in GU
[2:36:47] <godlesscruelty> "Gen"
[2:36:48] <%Intersceptre> pepega tier whetstoning
[2:36:48] <warmnoid> heat gauge was generations
[2:36:50] <%dekkitout> The finesse is mostly footing
[2:36:51] <HyperBomb21> Temporaral Mantle is for scrubs only, don't @ me
[2:37:06] <fruit_pie_the_magician> You should try hammer, it's pretty great
[2:37:18] <%PoonOfChaos> ^
[2:37:18] <Shishi1205> he has it on
[2:37:18] <%Intersceptre> Gunlance and Finesse exist in one sentence in the world
[2:37:22] <%imadoc91> @AngriestPat The greatsword is probably the best weapon for learning to use the slinger and clutch claw
[2:37:24] <Shishi1205> I never use temporal anymore
[2:37:25] <ekipan> pat gettin knocked around
[2:37:25] <%PoonOfChaos> I love playing hammer
[2:37:30] <%Intersceptre> "gunlance requires no finesse"
[2:37:31] <Goldenwolf98> Hammer is great
[2:37:32] <TsunTsuchinoko> hammer gets a finisher that claws onto the mon
[2:37:35] <CoffeeTableBlack> hammer hunter all day
[2:37:37] <Shishi1205> Hammer has dunk into clutch claw
[2:37:40] <+birkiedoc> Switch axe time!?!
[2:37:42] <Belutima> yo was that a godbug

[2:38:47] <cheesedburgers> Hammer will never be garbage because tsujimoto-san forbids it. It must always be dope as shit.
[2:38:49] <Zebroneath> Hammer has a REALLY good clutch claw move now.
[2:38:49] <@SSaryn> Hammer also has the same thing with GS when you're charging, you can flinch with rocks while charging and mobile.
[2:38:50] <danknugglit> Calculated
[2:38:56] <+emperordread> all according to keikaku
[2:38:57] <Shishi1205> Safi weapons are disgustingly good

[3:08:01] <%honeyman18> Why is woolie losing his shit over the shirt thing?
[3:08:06] <Dragovus> Woolie is never right
[3:08:10] <Aydarkzero> doodBARF
[3:08:18] <%ThatOneGameTester> the entirety of my stomach content is coming out
[3:08:24] <%weissguard> Makes Woolie sound like a flat-earther who goes on a plane with a level. Doesn't compute chief.
[3:08:36] <Belutima> DONT COMPARE VOMIT WITH CHILLI WTF
[3:08:40] <%ichibatmantony38> ichibatmantony38 subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[3:08:45] <hntronium> Pat are you gonna bring woolie being wrong back up on the podcast
[3:08:46] <%Ipsenscastle> I feel like Woolie is becoming insane in the opposite way to you as some form of counterattack
[3:08:48] <alwayspronking> Gunlance solves the Kushala Problem real good
[3:08:58] <@SSaryn> Bow has literally been the best for a while, even marginally, for quite a while. [In terms of DPS]
[3:09:01] <@SSaryn> And yes it does
[3:09:07] <extradopeness> There better be beans in the chili
[3:09:10] <Shishi1205> for ls? yes
[3:09:17] <Shishi1205> marginally by some frames tho
[3:09:21] <@SSaryn> It's strong for sure.
[3:09:25] <%Zulrez> Zulrez subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! hey pat, hope you and paige are doing great this xmas season, ive been playing irl death stranding, too bad i dont have a cute bb to distract me while i deliver gifts, ps my driver is a fan, she made this message for you http://tinyurl.com/2g9mqh
[3:09:27] <%weissguard> Bow? Best? *Bow-user HYPE intensifies*
[3:09:40] <Shishi1205> I mean if you are a god at it you will make good use
[3:10:04] <%ThatOneGameTester> @zulrez how dare
[3:10:07] <IminyourBase> wtf kind of metric is that?!?!
[3:10:11] <haxzzer> what?
[3:10:12] <@commanderclaw> What did he mean by this?
[3:10:14] <IminyourBase> 999 million dollars?
[3:10:17] <@SSaryn> Think he's making fun of some article.
[3:10:22] <hntronium> less than a billion
[3:10:31] <+emperordread> 1 mirrion dorra
[3:10:33] <$Dakuu75> that donation was drunk
[3:10:33] <hntronium> that's a stupid metric
[3:10:44] <%Ipsenscastle> who caaaares
[3:10:47] <extradopeness> That’s the dumbest
[3:10:48] <%ichibatmantony38> yeah...what? no....eh
[3:10:51] <%Mekhet09> There's an article about how much money it's going to make but now projections are changing.
[3:11:01] <hntronium> its like second place except there are a hundred people in first place
[3:11:03] <%Ipsenscastle> why would anyone have feelings about that
[3:11:21] <Shishi1205> it was kinda nerfed
[3:11:29] <Shishi1205> but you can get it out quickly
[3:11:32] <Goldenwolf98> Its not a nerf
[3:11:35] <%imadoc91> but it does more damage than before
[3:11:36] <zenith0111> BUT IT DOES MORE DAMAGE
[3:11:36] <extradopeness> Imagine caring about Star Wars after 2002
[3:11:37] <Shishi1205> and sleep attack is still good
[3:11:39] <Goldenwolf98> when it does more damage now
[3:11:40] <@SSaryn> It's more of a berf
[3:11:47] <hntronium> nuffed berf
[3:11:56] <%ichibatmantony38> lmao
[3:12:04] <azacca_bitter> berfed straight into the shirt
[3:12:04] <Goldenwolf98> It just means you need more skill to use the weapon now thats not a nerf LUL
[3:12:05] <%imadoc91> @AngriestPat TCS does more damage if you hit the first hit than it did before though.
[3:12:17] <%imadoc91> Wakeup nerf, but dps buff
[3:12:34] <%aeravon> not those rare ones from original. shield up isnt in a combo 4-pt gem
[3:12:49] <Goldenwolf98> Best way to wake up monsters now is running them into a wall anyways
[3:12:50] <@SSaryn> NICE
