[0:00:03] <%CJett92> He's playing Dragon Age Inquisition
[0:00:08] <%CJett92> At least until he gets bored of it
[0:00:20] <%korth367> did he say that
[0:00:26] <%CJett92> On twitter ya
[0:00:26] <+dirtyh4rr1> yep
[0:00:27] <%0dokuro> That might be quick then...
[0:00:28] <%CJett92> and right now lol
[0:00:30] <%korth367> ah
[0:00:31] <tetramyster> yeyeyeyeye
[0:00:32] <%korth367> neat
[0:00:32] <AggsMK7> So for 50 minutes?
[0:00:36] <~AngriestPat> OHHH YOU
[0:00:36] <%Doruben> ew
[0:00:38] <HerrDemsus> Why do you fear warframe?
[0:00:40] <+ribbithoppy> Inquisition time!
[0:00:44] <panderfaustin> time for dragon age: oops frostbite was a mistake
[0:00:53] <~AngriestPat> I actually played it for like, 20 hours back in the day, but shooting arrows was absurdly dull
[0:00:57] <+NightOwlSam> awwww yea, DA time
[0:00:58] <~AngriestPat> I shouldnt have gone archer
[0:00:59] <%PenmanLupine> Pats been a busy stream boy. every day this week.
[0:01:13] <%sunriser696> m
[0:01:16] <fiercefiresoul> I always go magic boi myself.
[0:01:18] <%0dokuro> Magic is kinda fun, but arrows were DEFINITELY boring
[0:01:19] <%Myribelle_> Archer gets good way late game
[0:01:19] <+nightw0lf174> i played archer my first time and ended up mostly controlling the other people
[0:01:23] <thetruthofyourbeing> AYO
[0:01:24] <+McSoliace> Assassin has a stand!
[0:01:25] <HerrDemsus> I went caster pat, and it sucked balls imo
[0:01:28] <doktorzee> im finally here to watch a stream live for once and im excited for DAI
[0:01:29] <panderfaustin> I'm guessing we're on a bioware binge
[0:01:31] <WanderingFlame7> Finally
[0:01:40] <sileo_patronus> Pure archer is the worst in most cases because of the time spent drawing arrows in place
[0:01:41] <HypeArbalest> Light saber mages
[0:01:43] <fiercefiresoul> Magic can wreck house if you get the right abilities.
[0:01:43] <%AbnormalVoid> SourPls
[0:01:45] <%Lion_kun> I went as Dwarf warrior
[0:01:46] <%emoonimoo> I've been trying to get into the Dragon Age series. A bit hesitant with Inquisition but I've played a few minutes of Origins.
[0:01:46] <mercedesamber> elf mage, elf mage, elf mage!
[0:01:50] <%RichardRasmus> @PenmanLupine the power of money helps disovle his fatigue
[0:01:50] <roflwaffleauthoritah> be a sneaky coward like in real life
[0:01:55] <%sunriser696> is weird that we have this Pat everyday system
[0:01:56] <%Lion_kun> i got in there and it was fine
[0:01:58] <romanticzomedy> Origins is really the only good one
[0:01:58] <%VantomPayne> I GAVE MY LIIIIFE
[0:01:59] <alrobot2014> WUT
[0:02:00] <upsidedown01> suuuuup :D
[0:02:01] <%Myribelle_> mages have the most button pushies and explosions
[0:02:02] <+NightOwlSam> nice thing is, even if you chose a class, you can switch between teammates for most of the game if you wanna mix it up
[0:02:04] <alrobot2014> NOT FOR HONOR
[0:02:06] <%0dokuro> I miss good'ol blood magic :__:
[0:02:08] <$codussalpha> HAHA! thou thought you could surprise me with a stream tonight! little did you know I, Coduss, was EXPECTING a stream all along and have been waiting for this moment!
[0:02:10] <%VantomPayne> BUT FOOOOR YOOOOU
[0:02:11] <thetruthofyourbeing> Nobody expects the...
[0:02:12] <%PenmanLupine> Bioware is on the same level of pants shitting as Bethesda, but it doesn't have nearly the same smell or smear consistency
[0:02:14] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@ToxInjection) (warning)
[0:02:14] <HerrDemsus> I think melee is much more fun
[0:02:17] <jaxondorfred> oh shit, it's that ginger pat
[0:02:18] <BourneWarrior> DA:I EW WHY?
[0:02:18] <alrobot2014> IN MY TIME
[0:02:18] <nicoleymcquack> i audibly just gasped
[0:02:21] <%FrostMass22> They should have had blood magic
[0:02:21] <woskiey> Whoaoaoa
[0:02:22] <+McSoliace> stab class is best class
[0:02:26] <%Stari> apatDab apatDab apatDab
[0:02:29] <%ShaneWhite> Dwarf Pat chose the dwarf
[0:02:30] <%ToxInjection> Truly the darkest and most corrupt of timelinea

[0:02:36] <MarylandJutsu> YOOOOO
[0:02:37] <%FrostMass22> Reminder that nearly every mage in DA is scum
[0:02:43] <BourneWarrior> RANGER CLASS BEST CLASS
[0:02:49] <upsidedown01> but what about two-hander
[0:02:50] <Tucker0603> nani?!? DA:I???? The game that always has me swapping between Templar and Knight Enchanter.
[0:02:50] <TootPirate> Solas biggest scum
[0:02:51] <WanderingFlame7> I love you Pat!
[0:02:52] <panderfaustin> I feel Origins has the better plot honestly
[0:02:56] <zafooru> oh boy dragon age stinkquisition
[0:03:01] <panderfaustin> but the gameplay would be boring for a stream
[0:03:01] <HerrDemsus> My necromancer kunari was not well liked by the public
[0:03:02] <mr_slaide> Solas is an asshole.
[0:03:05] <%rumtumtugnutz> a wild tugnutz appeared
[0:03:06] <thetruthofyourbeing> warrior boring af
[0:03:06] <+SuichiTanaka> DA:I is totally worth it for Iron Bull

[0:03:11] <mercedesamber> i'm going to hate this. i'm such a lover of dragon age and this game and i know people are shitting over it already ffs
[0:03:12] <fiercefiresoul> Origins has the more cohesive story, but Inquisition has the better characters.
[0:03:12] <woskiey> <Message deleted>
[0:03:13] <DHGJokerDHG> I gotta say dwarf rogue for pat

[0:11:00] <%NumbusPlays> origins was great, though
[0:11:04] <ADeadDiehard> The biggest strike against DAI is being in a world where Witcher 3 exists
[0:11:05] <%OwlLightningMage> i also didn't get that far in this

[0:11:15] <+Swaggamanca> da2 is one of the worst offenses in gaming
[0:11:16] <+Sp3ctre48> Origins is the only Dragon Age game I really liked

[0:11:21] <panderfaustin> The Fade in Dragon Age was a great concept, the whole Black City thing was great and really mysterious yet unique, just a shame about DA 2
[0:11:22] <%OwlLightningMage> I played like 20 hours and dropped the fuck off too LUL
[0:11:23] <%0dokuro> it is
[0:11:24] <Forces45> Magic is great in this game
[0:11:26] <lloyddboy> GET THOSE fEET BACK ON STREAM
[0:11:27] <+SuichiTanaka> Archers used to be great in the previous games, but it's kinda trash in DAI
[0:11:28] <Bailey__gaming> My love for you is like a truck Bezerker sould you like to making fuck Bezerker
[0:11:31] <+chronopaladin> dragon age 2 was a'ight

[0:11:45] <%goose_attack_almanac> I loved Dragon Age 2 despite it being rushed out
[0:11:46] <thetechnicalraven> I played like 3 hours and got fucking bored honestly LUL
[0:11:52] <Chipshandon12> shortly after i became a knight enchanter i quit because it suddenly became way more boring

[0:12:05] <sosuke5> Look at those Cotton Hill legs
[0:12:08] <%yoshkosh20> Pat is the couchmaster
[0:12:08] <%walternatorz> sounds like BDSM
[0:12:08] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> is that like a sybian?
[0:12:09] <TootPirate> starM
[0:12:09] <sonofthedeepsouth> Legal Incest
[0:12:09] <CheekyBirb> legally incestuous
[0:12:10] <+DespondentSloth> I absolutely abhor this game and am excited to see you play it
[0:12:10] <+JenovasPuppet> @goose_attack_almanac I legit think DA2 is a way better game than DA:I.
[0:12:10] <+ChaosVulpes> Couch master sounds like an early 90s cartoon...
[0:12:11] <Inferno_Icon> Archery is dabbing before you kill someone LUL
[0:12:12] <+KendallLitDinner> those things are dope
[0:12:12] <+gralho> NICE FEET TOES PAIGE
[0:12:12] <+WizardofWazz> its porn
[0:12:13] <daisymaisy02> Is it porn
[0:12:15] <+SuichiTanaka> Every main game in the Dragon Age series is worth it, purely for the characters. Though DA2 is definitely weaker in that.

[0:18:46] <Bouldus> lol
[0:18:47] <thetruthofyourbeing> Is this nsfw!????
[0:18:50] <fiercefiresoul> You can legit just steamroll through the Hinterlands for hours on end. This game can eat your free time alive and leave nothing in it's wake.
[0:18:51] <%Crankypancake> I already have anxiety over how fucking massive The Hinterlands are

[0:19:08] <dekkitout> ive been sitting criss cross since kindergarden, and by god I WILL NOT STOP
[0:19:08] <%CJett92> It's FINE
[0:19:08] <theInkShow> Is super gey
[0:19:09] <ADeadDiehard> It's good, k?
[0:19:09] <DatAsuna> This game is worse than andromeda
[0:19:10] <+Sp3ctre48> It's aggressively mediocre
[0:19:10] <thetruthofyourbeing> Agreesively boring
[0:19:10] <LordU_> Nah it's pretty mediocre
[0:19:12] <%Freelance7> 7
[0:19:12] <dakuman13> it's gay?
[0:19:13] <Videogamer4> Kreygasm
[0:19:14] <+JenovasPuppet> 6.5/10
[0:19:14] <+cerberuscarmine> no its a 5
[0:19:14] <Bouldus> and made to play like an mmo by yourself
[0:19:15] <+LumberjackJack> It has huge pacing problems, but a wonderful story in there
[0:19:15] <upsidedown01> GOODKAY
[0:19:15] <alrobot2014> SUPER FiNE
[0:19:15] <Chipshandon12> this game is much worse than its predecessors but its okay
[0:19:16] <WanderingFlame7> This game is a 6/10
[0:19:16] <+AltunRes> Iron Bull makes the game better.
[0:19:16] <%OwlLightningMage> 5 / 10 is DA2
[0:19:16] <%0dokuro> Ya, thats fair
[0:19:16] <%templar010> Its a biiiig Okay.
[0:19:16] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> 6.9
[0:19:17] <CheekyBirb> generally less leg mean more painful leg crossing
[0:19:17] <AgentOfParanoia> 7
[0:19:17] <Critical_MissY> Inquisition is good, but spread way, waaaaaaaaaay too thin.
[0:19:17] <+democrazyyy> aggressively fine
[0:19:17] <%CJett92> solid 6.5
[0:19:19] <+mr_dangus> The most OK
[0:19:20] <Mechanical_Mayhem> Jevil fight pleace
[0:19:20] <%Dest_121> Its fine
[0:19:21] <strangelee> Then Andromeda happened
[0:19:22] <chza> yeah its a slid 7/10, origins was a 10/10 tho
[0:19:22] <+Sp3ctre48> that becomes kind of good for Tresspasser
[0:19:22] <+Caffieantedjedi> I'd rather just play the original Dragon Age
[0:19:23] <+FrogCatapult> Lots of filler
[0:19:23] <%TheDullaMAN> It's ALWAYS hat 3/4 chub
[0:19:23] <%GohanEgret> 8 is great like what
[0:19:25] <WanderingFlame7> 6/10
[0:19:25] <%manwithboxonhead> 7/10
[0:19:25] <grunkledan_> i really like this game...
[0:19:25] <Zoh87> yeah a solid 7
[0:19:27] <sonofthedeepsouth> Good K
[0:19:27] <+redanimator> it still won Game Awards game of year tho
[0:19:27] <%bread_assassin> Rule #1: Get the fuck of the Hintelands ASAP.
[0:19:28] <+Pendlez> any game where I can be gay is rad
[0:19:29] <Punareff> is good, im biased tho
[0:19:29] <alrobot2014> the sidequests are a bit meh
[0:19:30] <panderfaustin> Is that an actual 7 or an IGN 7 where means its actually shit
[0:19:31] <daisymaisy02> Yea but there's gays so extra point
[0:19:31] <upsidedown01> the most okay game
[0:19:31] <+SuichiTanaka> DAI is good, DA2 is the mediocre one
[0:19:31] <Novillion> 7-8 is actually pretty good
[0:19:33] <Oqzar> and for some reason it won goty
[0:19:33] <thetruthofyourbeing> I could have played through ds1 again
[0:19:34] <sonofthedeepsouth> Aggressive 7
[0:19:36] <+sunny_side_up> i dont think you know how the modern 1-10 scale works @GohanEgret
[0:19:36] <+alphonseisbest> strong 7.5
[0:19:36] <DatAsuna> I'd take andromeda over this shit easy xD
[0:19:36] <%milhousego> HUMAN MAGE
[0:19:37] <LordU_> As if that means anything
[0:19:39] <+NightOwlSam> a good 7, can't romance varric ;__;
[0:19:40] <alrobot2014> DAO is the best
[0:19:42] <%PROUD2beGINGER> Forgettably good
[0:19:42] <dekkitout> mathematically, 5/10 is good
[0:19:42] <Bailey__gaming> It just had ugly character models th a people complained about if i remember
[0:19:43] <ScreenVoice> FEET
[0:19:44] <%RichardRasmus> 8 is a strong number
[0:19:46] <%Remery_> Cream of the Week <3
[0:19:47] <sonofthedeepsouth> This 7 punches you in the mouth
[0:19:47] <+Caffieantedjedi> DA:I is mediocre. DA2 is just bad.
[0:19:47] <%0dokuro> Crazy 7
[0:19:48] <daisymaisy02> Gotta love any game where I can live my Best Gay Life
[0:19:48] <%brickwall35> Daily dose, huh?
[0:19:50] <+Sp3ctre48> DA2 and DAI are both pretty mediocre
[0:19:52] <%OwlLightningMage> It's a 7-8 where Origins was 9-10
[0:19:53] <%GohanEgret> @sunny_side_up oh I do, it's silly that it's like that
[0:19:53] <JDRK> good
[0:19:53] <Bouldus> lol
[0:19:54] <nicoleymcquack> are you hyoe for the new DA that was teased?
[0:19:55] <ham_boat> I‚Äôd go as high as 8, if only for how cool the characters are
[0:19:56] <alrobot2014> 7/10 because Sera Exists
[0:19:57] <+Pompadourius> Can‚Äôt romance Leliana, 4/10
[0:19:57] <Bouldus> to many puns
[0:20:00] <+Pendlez> I'd bottom for Iron Bull any day
[0:20:00] <Bouldus> Kappa

[0:20:05] <thetruthofyourbeing> I came twice now. the Feet
[0:20:09] <%Myribelle_> DAI is made infinitely better once you finish Trespasser
[0:20:09] <+JenovasPuppet> He secretly made you say something clippable
[0:20:10] <Bouldus> MAOR PUNS
[0:20:10] <%rumtumtugnutz> most of the DA games are aggressively mediocre
[0:20:11] <geosspone> I personally love the DA series, and Inquisition is one of my favorite all time games
[0:20:11] <%SaltyDongs> More punssss
[0:20:11] <+alphonseisbest> 7 out of 4

[0:20:26] <+alphonseisbest> bombast is trash
[0:20:27] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Straight male romances suck in the game. Break the glass ceiling. Rise up, gamers
[0:20:29] <%AbnormalVoid> next tuesday or what?
[0:20:29] <starkiller0341> dont recruit sera !!!!!!!
[0:20:30] <fiercefiresoul> Look, in Inquisition you can get butt-porked by a big, burly Qunari Warrior. How can this game get anything LESS than an 8/10?
[0:20:31] <Fujiwara_92> DA2 IS GOOD THO, SARCASTIC FEM HAWKE IS BESt PunOko
[0:20:31] <%SuperCasualBoom> Super Casual Confusion!!!

[0:21:10] <%TheSpiritof2277> Bioware? More like Biocursed
[0:21:10] <%violetheart> There's literally a new game coming out. Now's not the time to be worrying it's dying.

[0:21:14] <sonofthedeepsouth> Its gonna be Andromeda

[0:22:10] <stigna1> I gotta say, I quite liked DA;I, not as much as origins but its good. Has pat started yet or are we just going super deep on the patcast.

[0:53:50] <%seriousseen> Because this game has millions of bugs
[0:53:51] <gagthor87> not how i thought i'd be spending my break at work
[0:53:51] <foreverN2dust> Things Pat has Been: Basketball, Saw, Wrong
[0:53:52] <+kingceasar87> he beat DAI!!
[0:53:54] <$vectorcannonready> Time for Persona 5
[0:53:57] <%TheDullaMAN> How can someone be a saw, but still not cut it?
[0:53:58] <Hanbei1708> chin megumi tensay when
[0:54:00] <Velociraptor_Cleftes> Nope, this game is clearly unplayable, switch to Tokyo Mirage Sessions.
[0:54:00] <+KENTASHIRO> is Pat becoming big RPG streams?
[0:54:00] <RamenRiderZ> Visited by Todd Howard
[0:54:00] <VentusHero> "if its in the game, its in the game" - actual EA quote
[0:54:02] <HairballCT> pat took a murder knife to the stream
[0:54:06] <+colonelnasty02> have u played this before
[0:54:07] <jastrouble97> @chancho4tierra i never saw lag on the multiplayer except in the menus that was shit
[0:54:09] <@SSaryn> No.
[0:54:10] <$ooblagis> lolno
[0:54:10] <dakuman13> again?
[0:54:11] <%maskedriderhero> Reminder, Pat is 5'2" and played basketball, and Prince was 5'3" and played basketball, it's not that weird!
[0:54:13] <hcipap> yes yes more smt talk
[0:54:14] <+HellCopter> Nobody was actually dinged.
[0:54:15] <JinjaBredMan> Chance of a lifetime?
[0:54:16] <%0dokuro> Or maybe not, who knows
[0:54:16] <LeeOhX> Atlas sucks
[0:54:17] <romanticzomedy> too bad it's a shitty game
[0:54:17] <%TheSpiritof2277> not happening
[0:54:18] <%LtThunderbolt> keep dreaming
[0:54:20] <$ooblagis> They have streaming restrictions of PQ2
[0:54:21] <+OceanGovernor> Yes Japanese companies love that
[0:54:21] <%NumbusPlays> did anyone ever get taken down for it?
[0:54:24] <vingadivo> hahahaha no
[0:54:25] <+AtlasMcCoy> Rude
[0:54:26] <Donk_> Atlas is a great game Kappa
[0:54:28] <Notsocleveruser> Ah darn I mistook this for dragons dogma... but instead it's a much more disappointing game.
[0:54:28] <grunkledan_> atlas haven't actually punished anyone tho
[0:54:29] <%RantingRavager> apparently Atlas is... okay as long as you have like 50 friends to play with
[0:54:29] <%shen4u> RIP sears
[0:54:29] <strangelee> Put it on the Channel
[0:54:30] <%walternatorz> Hey! Maybe the cutscenes are fixed too! Surely that bug is one-in-a-million too
[0:54:31] <%sunriser696> persona 5 on the switch lets go
[0:54:31] <%Dest_121> i don't think they ever did anything about persona 5 streaming
[0:54:31] <Rentixx> most of Atlas's issues were fixed. Horrible launch though
[0:54:32] <+Sp3ctre48> They'll just give you a mean look but not actually do anything about it again
[0:54:33] <derpicus506> moon shoes
[0:54:33] <CountMeowingtonn> my favorite basketball clip is that guy running under another mans legs
[0:54:33] <%SuperCasualBoom> Watch Joker play on Smash stream and Altus takes it down
[0:54:34] <+ImoutoMoogle> you can stream it through remote play though
[0:54:36] <%GohanEgret> @dakuman13 history and recent website registrations suggest an updated P5
[0:54:36] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@Rellim80) (warning)
[0:54:37] <SeventyForce> Maybe when P5 comes out on teh VITAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
[0:54:37] <blackbeaking> jump everywhere
[0:54:40] <+PreAlphaTonyC_> You already can stream it
[0:54:40] <reiju_22> @NumbusPlays I watched 4 playthroughs on twitch from popular streamers. nothing happened
[0:54:41] <strangelee> what do you have to lose?
[0:54:41] <AristoMercu> i didnt see anyone get in trouble for streaming/LPing P5 lmao
[0:54:43] <+daftskye> theres a fun bug that happens quite often if you jump a lot w here your loegs swim thru the air
[0:54:43] <AggsMK7> Lower SHADOW quality
[0:54:44] <%SleepyFranke> yaaaay more
[0:54:45] <@SSaryn> What the fuck is this stuttering...
[0:54:45] <+colonelnasty02> choppy as HELL
[0:54:47] <%Chichen> @AngriestPat running at 1080p stream might be causing issues
[0:54:47] <%CitrusDrink> impress Casandra by mastering the double jump
[0:54:48] <zafooru> graphics go down
[0:54:48] <%0dokuro> They talked a lot about it, but plenty of people streamed it
[0:54:48] <+Lavanio> SETTINGS DOWN
[0:54:48] <Tucker0603> didn't Franz stream p5?
[0:54:49] <+TheDude8D> take your time

[0:54:50] <+Kavtech> I want Persona 5 Portable on the switch with a female playable character.
[0:54:50] <%SaltyDongs> No it's fine
[0:54:50] <nicoleymcquack> i just got p5 and it still has screen recording restrictions :(
[0:54:51] <CaptainFrankincense> I care
[0:54:52] <Zeemod155> Atlas has backed down and is not longer paying attention to P5 streamers
[0:54:53] <+meowmeow7t> I CARE
[0:54:53] <ScreenVoice> NEW GAM
[0:54:53] <depressedpepega> that's a pretty short jump Kappa
[0:54:54] <finnlad00> WE cares
[0:54:54] <+PreAlphaTonyC_> Pat just a coward
[0:54:54] <Macfine> The legs are a bit long , but not bad character creation
[0:54:55] <%rumtumtugnutz> was this game always this janky?
[0:54:55] <%MisterTylerrr> Literally everyone cares, Paige
[0:54:55] <Chipshandon12> turn multisampling off
[0:54:55] <AggsMK7> SHADOWs are USELESS

[0:54:58] <RamenRiderZ> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[0:54:59] <$ooblagis> Put it down to 1080
[0:54:59] <dwarvomancer> turn off MSAA
[0:55:00] <vingadivo> 1
[0:55:00] <%Chichen> @AngriestPat running stream at 1080p might be using more CPU
[0:55:01] <CountMeowingtonn> IT'S ALWAYS THE SHADOWS
[0:55:01] <%Dest_121> tons of people streamed all of persona 5
[0:55:02] <Velociraptor_Cleftes> GO, Smol Chungus! Let the legend come back to life!

[0:55:20] <%Dhrall> It's kind of funny listening to Paige complaining about how long it's taking to play the game given how long they both usually just talk
[0:55:21] <blackbeaking> got through donations fast and still isn't playinf
[0:55:23] <+colonelnasty02> how much frames is this game lol \
