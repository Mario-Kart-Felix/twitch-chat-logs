[0:01:59] <%Xelhesia> woolie's back is hurt so no podcast today
[0:01:59] <foxname96> CastleSuperPat
[0:02:00] <%AzureGale> Woolie's back must still be killing him
[0:02:07] <Rei_Dsoto> Wooten!
[0:02:08] <+lemjor10> Woolie doesn‚Äôt exist
[0:02:08] <kingmemelord97> This is early even if the podcast is canceled
[0:02:14] <joebeilieves> So Woolie is no longer back in?
[0:02:15] <%shurtal> trying to grind up DRK, man doing older dungeons SUCKS
[0:02:19] <+tsubakiparadox> damn that sucks, Good Vibes for Woolies back
[0:02:22] <chimeraxmachina> Oh no poor woolie :(
[0:02:24] <TheShockVox> Poor Woolie. Damn
[0:02:27] <anAngryHamster> Just have Woolie lie on his back our of frame like Paige does
[0:02:33] <joebeilieves> brucegAutumn
[0:02:36] <%AzureGale> Woolie is locked in an epic one-on-one match with his back
[0:02:36] <molens90> Fortnite Fridays on Monday
[0:02:39] <vVAstrAVv> what no podcast today?
[0:02:41] <$milhousego> @xelhesia wait, is that the reason? I thought they would both be reeling from Miura
[0:02:41] <Rei_Dsoto> Hope he recovers
[0:02:43] <marvel877> @joebeilieves Woolie's back's out.
[0:02:43] <Fefe41> Woolie marked as DNP: Old on the injury report
[0:02:45] <postmortempc> Maybe pay suckered Woolie into doing a raid together
[0:02:52] <%X2Eliah> X2Eliah subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months! Hey Pat! Please tell Woolie to get his back checked out by doctors; lower back issues - especially if related to spinal disc troubles - take months if not years to resolve. Sitting at home hoping it goes away does not work, and I fear Woolie be doing that
[0:02:53] <foxname96> Woolie back broken from all the sex with only purposes of procreation he was having
[0:02:58] <TheShockVox> He‚Äôs sore from carrying us through out the crisis that was ‚ÄúFINAL‚Äù
[0:03:06] <sjcodan> wait isn't it podcast time
[0:03:06] <%holydeviant1> My mom was so angry to find out the crystal tower is now required
[0:03:09] <%SwdVengeance> Ol' Man Woolie pounded his back into oblivion
[0:03:13] <YakumoYomi> psaDogchamp
[0:03:25] <joebeilieves> Back out = cowardice ( just jokes )
[0:03:25] <SunnyVarietyPack> Woolie did the big die
[0:03:28] <Fefe41> He carried so hard on the StarCraft stream his back gave out
[0:03:36] <%brickwall35> brickwall35 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 25 months! Pat you're wrong
[0:03:36] <%transporterthesequel> @swdvengeance good pounded, or bad pounded?
[0:03:37] <%Maids4lyfe> Is Woolie okay?
[0:03:39] <sjcodan> I thought Wooile was supposed to be the healthy one of the pair
[0:03:42] <%Xelhesia> @milhousego woolie said his bacl's been hurting all week so no cast today
[0:03:44] <derekwst3> Pat can do a podcast himself
[0:03:48] <molens90> GWS and rest well Woolie
[0:03:59] <sjcodan> !!! SPINE AT RISK !!!
[0:04:03] <%Maids4lyfe> man, I hope Woolie gets better soon
[0:04:03] <%X2Eliah> @SwdVengeance Now that reminds me of the famous "Pounded in the butt by ......" series of high class erotica novels by Chuck Tingle. Fun reads!
[0:04:05] <foxname96> @transporterthesequel both at the same time Kappa
[0:04:11] <+lemjor10> Pat only podcast of him just screaming nonsense and crazy talk
[0:04:12] <%AzureGale> @derekwst3 This is probably what the stream will be lol

[0:04:18] <@mothmandraws> pat heading back to the bozja mines
[0:04:26] <postmortempc> Speaking of backs being out anyone know if Paige is still alive
[0:04:27] <%Frost_Quill> @sjcodan Are any of them really healthy?  Pat, Paige, Woolie...I don't think so.
[0:04:28] <themightyquinn3000> Pat only podcast where he talks about orb for 3 hours
[0:04:29] <CheesesSliced> Seriously though, Woolie should look into physio. A trip to the ortho probably wouldn't hurt either.
[0:04:29] <semachie> hope wools starts feelin better soon
[0:04:37] <foxname96> @balthazar758 back hurts hard
[0:04:40] <%Blackmage9999> Hello pat from Goblin!

[0:13:20] <chambatron> What happened to Woolie's back?
[0:13:20] <CheesesSliced> Can we call Gief the ball-less Greek god Testicles?
[0:13:21] <dubstep_paladin> Noble Gief or No Ball Gief
[0:13:21] <sjcodan> Pat why is your camera so bad?

[0:13:44] <Daniel_Is_I> @PatStaresAt Have you looked into getting dog stairs for the bed?
[0:13:45] <OldManDeckardCain> what did woolie do, he seems more devastated than a dog losing his balls

[0:18:40] <NitronStreams> isnt that just every one in the csb universe
[0:18:42] <mastermidget23> Pat should have seen the chaos that was Tiny Tim vs the Attache case.
[0:18:42] <marvel877> the time he killed that guy in football.
[0:18:42] <TheFranss> If that had been said way WAY back during Machinima times, I would've believed that about Woolie LUL

[0:19:03] <ScreamLord> WTF?
[0:19:06] <+fusukok> Nah, I believe that more than the back story
[0:19:08] <%Frost_Quill> I'd believe that ants are literally the dominant species on this planet, we just pretend it's us.
[0:19:08] <%Xelhesia> but that happened tho
[0:19:08] <%coward_man> I thought that was a joke when it happened for like 3 days
[0:19:09] <Sunstalker> Pat can't make it today because Paige ate glass/poison

[0:25:10] <stantheman_97> i can't imagine it feels good
[0:25:12] <$QueequegTheater> Fun fact, defibrillators DO NOT work on someone with no pulse
[0:25:13] <OldManDeckardCain> it's literally getting puncjed by a heavy weight boxer
[0:25:14] <%zeroarturia> shibuy4SUGOI shibuy4DEKAI
[0:25:15] <koffeemancer> Duh dude

[0:25:28] <%Frost_Quill> You get defibrillated while conscious?
[0:25:30] <fat_burtreynolds> Like that time they almost killed him with the defibrillator paddles
[0:25:30] <%sakeydo> Your dad get any paranormal powers from that shit. Lol
[0:25:30] <%luftraumm1> don't bite your tongue
[0:25:31] <derekwst3> defibbing is the opposite, it slows your heart
[0:25:31] <Sunstalker> Big DNR tatto on your chest? ü§î
[0:25:32] <@mothmandraws> defib only makes me stronger
[0:25:38] <%JoshManVGH> Remember DNR orders are just about not using Defib and CPR, cause that can be suffering.
[0:25:38] <sjcodan> THE REAL ZAPPING SYSTEM
[0:25:39] <%thbluewarden> not unless you tell them beforehand
[0:25:40] <+Zonino> If you're at the point you're getting deflibulated it's because you have no pulse.
[0:25:41] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> I imagine most defibs are necessary. No one lining up for fun.
[0:25:42] <NeonBleu> gotta get the "Do not defibulate" tattoo
[0:25:46] <%Frost_Quill> FUCK
[0:25:48] <skyentombment> BOO NOT RESUCITATE
[0:25:48] <%KishinGrek> @figleafplays Stop It! just let me go
[0:25:53] <$QueequegTheater> Defib also does nothing on a fully stopped heart

[0:26:04] <%TheYellowcouch> my uncle had complications due to diabetes and died twice during  one operation. it was fucking nuts
[0:26:05] <TheShockVox> I‚Äôd want it to only get electric powers. Gosh damn it, I will be Static or Black Lightning. SHOCK is my username
[0:26:07] <@Velyndra> a tazer is like 1/200th of a defib
[0:26:12] <DickieWoodsmall_279> too early or this shit
[0:26:13] <%SunnyVarietyPack> did he see hell?
[0:26:14] <chambatron> Anything that start with the letter "de" is bad for the mind and body
[0:26:15] <$QueequegTheater> yeah I fucking bet
[0:26:15] <%d1stantutopia> But Pat, I thought you were pro Zapping System?

[0:26:21] <balthazar758> gotta reboot this human being
[0:26:21] <koffeemancer> ok but what if you use the defibs as a weapon in an action movie
[0:26:23] <CheesesSliced> You can use a lamp to defric in a pinch. I seen it in a movie. For realsies
[0:26:25] <+OhioNitsud> ghosts can't sign DNRs
[0:26:26] <ScreamLord> I imagine it would feel like getting punched in the chest with a brick
[0:26:34] <+cafefunk> Are we talking about Near Death Experiences
[0:26:37] <%Beough> cause it's like an electric current restarting your heart right? is that how it works?
[0:26:49] <$QueequegTheater> @cafefunk no, actual death experiences
[0:26:51] <+evbites> i got electrocuted from a lamp not fun

[0:38:22] <marvel877> "I hope all the bad things in life happen to you and no one else but you!" - Chappelle's Show, Player Hater's Ball
[0:38:22] <TheFranss> By the way, any in the chat played Yakuza 3 Remastered for PC? Why does it start running so bad after 30 mins of playing?
[0:38:25] <$Ziegsy> @mothmandraws kzxSON mothman?
[0:38:29] <@JustinianKnight> that'd be cool
[0:38:30] <penitentpendant> @QueequegTheater Had a run where my healer volunteered our group to fight Lyon. I was the ONLY person w/o res sickness when we went up to fight him.
[0:38:31] <@mothmandraws> nah there is another mothman
[0:38:35] <AmericanaRed> FES shibuy4Naruto shibuy4Naruto shibuy4Naruto shibuy4Naruto shibuy4Naruto shibuy4Naruto shibuy4Naruto shibuy4Naruto shibuy4Naruto shibuy4Naruto
[0:38:39] <postmortempc> @theshockvox it‚Äôs what he said once on the old channel so I just assume that was one of the things
[0:38:41] <$QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt But what if the EX series is a Dark Souls crossover
[0:38:45] <%washicka> Oh man a new mix of their music
[0:38:45] <+SoySocks> @QueequegTheater FES is like "The Golden" for Persona 3. "The Answer" is a separate epilogue
[0:38:49] <%Frost_Quill> I don't know which players are worse, the ones who just REFUSE to do the mechanics and get mad, or the ones who just don't read their chat box and bash their head against the mechanic not realizing they're doing anything wrong.
[0:38:50] <+Akizea> wont we be getting the final boss on expac though since they wanna finish it up?
[0:38:51] <%walternatorz> Yoshi Pat
[0:38:51] <$QueequegTheater> IMAGINE IT THOUGH
[0:38:53] <%Areus> triHmm
[0:38:53] <+TheAntitype> @QueequegTheater FES is a version of the game that contains The Answer.
[0:38:53] <@mothmandraws> I think .1-.3 is going to be a side story adventur
[0:39:02] <%Garthunox> Final boss of EW is .0
[0:39:02] <TheShockVox> @queequegtheater FES comes with the answer. It‚Äôs basically a post game
[0:39:08] <$QueequegTheater> It's really fun
[0:39:11] <%Garthunox> They said EW will wrap up in .0
[0:39:13] <kimonochrono> he means the ex version probably
[0:39:14] <%KineticZen> one is Castrum Lacus Litore
[0:39:17] <viewtifulr> I want my golbez armor for BlackMage :(
[0:39:18] <$QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Also in a car
[0:39:20] <%JoshManVGH> League and Brain?
[0:39:23] <%KishinGrek> just don't be racist
[0:39:25] <+crazyspartan214> true
[0:39:25] <TheGammaBear> Just make sure if you're being toxic, you understand how fountains work
[0:39:25] <%Frost_Quill> I feel guilty if I'm toxic in my own head.
[0:39:28] <+atteroproxy> @Garthunox Think he ment savage
[0:39:29] <%shurtal> what about a room with people who agree with you?
[0:39:30] <TheFranss> Hol' up. Aint MW2 and Halo 3 lobbies allowed any more?
[0:39:33] <Vyskus> honestly fuck the floor
[0:39:34] <MarylandJutsu> @PatStaresAt oh yeah is grinding for the shiny Laws Order, is it bettter to do the alliance or are Fates better/guranteed?
[0:39:34] <$QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt In a car in traffic I say the vilest shit ever
[0:39:40] <ironohki> Toxic man drops mad wisdom about toxisity.
[0:39:40] <+TheAntitype> @TheGammaBear LUL
[0:39:40] <%d1stantutopia> DON'T BE TOXIC AT THE FLOOR, DRAGOONS LIVE THERE
[0:39:43] <balthazar758> or if you are a comedian
[0:39:44] <%Frost_Quill> That's a toxic echo chamber.
[0:39:44] <@mothmandraws> 1-3 will likely be side story wrapping up people who could not be in msq. 4-5 will be heading into a new story
[0:39:45] <bob900000> woolie
[0:39:45] <%iErik4> arent DRGs toxic at the floor?
[0:39:47] <penitentpendant> Toxic echo chambers
[0:39:50] <twohitgood> being toxic in your mind primes you to be toxic outside your mind, too.
[0:39:51] <%GarbageNirvana> Then you're ganging up on someone who deserves it
[0:39:53] <+RealMisterJ> Hey Pat, I have to ask. How do YOU make your gil?
[0:39:53] <Tukaru> Being toxic at the floor is just another name for drunk vomiting
[0:39:55] <MillaMoks> @PatStaresAt But earlier they said that 6.0 will finish the story and all the patches afterwards will be the start of the new story. How would that work with the schedule for primals you had in mind?
[0:39:57] <%caramelatte1> 13 year olds deserve to be bullied though over xbox chat
[0:40:04] <%KineticZen> Imagine wiping to Taste of Blood
[0:40:04] <+TheAntitype> I still haven't finished Castrum.
[0:40:07] <fat_burtreynolds> What about in League of Legends
[0:40:07] <%mister___doctor> But then what is Xbox Live even worth
[0:40:08] <%valriot> People who deserve it, and whenever youre right
[0:40:09] <%KishinGrek> DSPs fans
[0:40:12] <%X2Eliah> @shurtal That's a recipe for getting a recording of a seminar at a white-power rally
[0:40:15] <$QueequegTheater> @MarylandJutsu it really depends on your luck, the RNG is varied as hell
[0:40:16] <iosephe> What if they're tanks who don't use AOEs in dungeons and toggle their tank stance on and off in rotation?
[0:40:17] <chambatron> "reverse uno card"
[0:40:17] <%thedankestmeeme> what about being toxic At the internet game you happen to be playing with 8 ppl
[0:40:17] <bob900000> Jesus
[0:40:20] <%KishinGrek> that's a toxic chamber
[0:40:20] <%TheYellowcouch> be toxic to the people who have idea about the thing you're being toxic about
[0:40:21] <%shurtal> I've yet to do Lion, cause i KNOW i'll fuck it up
[0:40:24] <%JoshManVGH> Don't browbeat people with your toxicity
[0:40:28] <%KineticZen> Yeah, you don't do it in public of course
[0:40:29] <MarylandJutsu> @QueequegTheater even for the fates?
[0:40:31] <@mothmandraws> shurtal lyon is super easy
[0:40:32] <MarylandJutsu> booo
[0:40:38] <nicegrandmafingers> they're going to do the alliance raids and pandemonium in 6.x anyway
[0:40:38] <@mothmandraws> staying bottom is actually harder
[0:40:38] <%KineticZen> Also Lyon isn't that bad once you get a practice run in
[0:40:46] <nicegrandmafingers> so they can still do 4 fiends
[0:40:48] <stormhawk9891> OOF
[0:40:50] <%AEUG_Ace_Kamille> O O F
[0:40:50] <Tukaru> Just leave as healer and take the mettle loss and go do something else
[0:40:51] <$QueequegTheater> @MarylandJutsu Which fates, the 60 or the 36
[0:40:52] <@mothmandraws> lyon is literally can you side step, do sloppy and dodge 1 moving aoe
[0:40:57] <+mrbones41> have you heard about the new final fantasy that is going to be a soulslike ? apparently team ninja is making it
[0:41:08] <%justcallmebobplease> GET
[0:41:09] <%justcallmebobplease> STICK
[0:41:11] <%AEUG_Ace_Kamille> Disco is weird. It is soul crushing but also really uplifting.
[0:41:12] <%justcallmebobplease> BUGGED
[0:41:17] <%KineticZen> And use knockback resists
[0:41:18] <%X2Eliah> Disco was so great. .... But somehow I don't want to replay it.
[0:41:18] <MarylandJutsu> @QueequegTheater uhhhh 60 I believe (the ones where you have to do HW and SB alliances)
[0:41:21] <%GarbageNirvana> To clarify, this was in Xelphatol after they left one of the warballoons half killed and tried to run to the next area, they may have been being facetious about the whole thing because I got three commendations afterward but they were still weird assholes about it anyway
[0:41:21] <skyentombment> Speaking of entire classrooms that are doomed to hell, once in fourth grade, someone broke the fan we had, and when the teacher asked who did it, everyone blamed me, despite me being in the opposite end of the school with my best friend. They did so because the big kid did it, and he blamed it on me so everyone went along
[0:41:22] <%KineticZen> or a gap closer
[0:41:23] <%blastazoid00> blastazoid00 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 17 months! Hey Pat, you're  kind of cool
[0:41:27] <%d1stantutopia> @mothmandraws what is sloppy? Do you mean SLOPPEH
[0:41:33] <%Beough> has there been any announcement on when the series x version of disco is coming out?
[0:41:33] <%BoxNavy> no
[0:41:35] <penitentpendant> @mothmandraws Lot of folks die to that knockback

[0:41:50] <penitentpendant> @mothmandraws Wind's Peak
[0:41:53] <+atteroproxy> The rare occasion where I don't want Praetorium, I get Praetorium
[0:41:59] <iosephe> that's the hard part
[0:42:00] <+D00msDayDan> but does that include heavensward?
[0:42:03] <%X2Eliah> Wait what do you mean Pat
[0:42:05] <+blastazoid00> Except on alliance roulette
[0:42:06] <+bumrush8> even blue mage???
[0:42:07] <%TheYellowcouch> rise above the scrub
[0:42:07] <Tukaru> Except when you run 50/60/70 roulette
[0:42:16] <%solracc25> All must cap
[0:42:17] <%X2Eliah> Do ppl only see others of the same level?
[0:42:17] <MarylandJutsu> god I fear Sages who never healed before
[0:42:19] <+projectmanatees> healers need to do dps
[0:42:20] <bob900000> do you need to level every class?
[0:42:23] <MarylandJutsu> as a healer main

[0:42:31] <$QueequegTheater> @MarylandJutsu honestly If you know/have a blue mage do the fates, otherwise I would recommend mixing it up yourself
[0:42:32] <@mothmandraws> some of those guys heading to ultimate
[0:42:33] <Tracazoid> Craft all the things
[0:42:34] <%CzeekyTV> Free trial players are better than the average end game player, yeah I said it
[0:42:36] <NitronStreams> FF14 with the free trail up to level 60 including the award winning expansion Heavensward?
[0:42:36] <%Frost_Quill> I still need two dog mounts and all the dragon mounts.

[0:43:53] <%chance_h> Turns out the friends we made was no one along
[0:43:54] <%X2Eliah> "f-in weirdo" is also very different from "creep" so it could always be worse

[0:46:23] <%ironohki> That feel when you need wood for a quest, there are trees everywhere, but you need to find the specific "wood" item.
[0:46:28] <+sandwich_jones> peaches come in a can

[0:47:55] <+BIumen> crystal braves sucked me in i loved that shit
[0:47:56] <%DakotaMacDoodle> Man does it start going once you get past that
[0:47:58] <mortificent> yeah, at around 50 to 55, it starts picking up
[0:47:58] <TioXyco> Oh wow... this is a really early stream from pat
[0:47:58] <dan_g_v> yo what's up, why stream?
[0:47:59] <%Tenkay> Tenkay subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 37 months, currently on a 37 month streak! Heya Pat hope you got all those 300 something TT cards for whatever the reward is gonna be since they keep bringing it up every single live letter
[0:48:00] <TheGammaBear> Yeah ARR suffers from being an introduction arc
[0:48:02] <thetunnelhomer> I still can't believe Minfilia's mom is only 37. I thought she would have been like 60.
[0:48:03] <%CalderGaming> alphinaud's big idea was very much before the pickup for me -_-
[0:48:09] <T_Sasquatch> THE CRYSTAL BRAVES
[0:48:11] <%Reveresao> Playing also. A lot of fetch quests or go talk to this person then come back to talk to me
[0:48:15] <%Jaxnos> i've been having a blast in ARR. meeting ridiculous side characters and most of them being Lalafells in my experience has been great.
[0:48:16] <%d1stantutopia> @Vibe__Lord BUT THE VINTAGE! TALK TO THIS BLIND LALAFELL AND THIS ROE WHO TREATS YOU LIKE SHIT, FOR THE WINE
[0:48:16] <%KineticZen> Alphinaud did nothing wrong
[0:48:20] <$QueequegTheater> Switch to tank instead, healers are about to lose their instaqueues
[0:48:21] <@JustinianKnight> maybe its just me but I still enjoy alot of that ARR stuff
[0:48:21] <thetunnelhomer> Why did they give Outer Heaven to a teenager?
[0:48:23] <$RealThiele> woolie still messed up?
[0:48:24] <@SSaryn> Yeah if you're a DPS, see if you can get a healer or tank friend.
[0:48:33] <mrjplays2k9> It didnt pick up for me til a bit into heavensward
[0:48:34] <%caramelatte1> Until EW and then its just Tanks

[0:49:29] <%X2Eliah> Man I do love the mental image of Woolie just going ham on some bedsheets
[0:49:39] <%TheYellowcouch> Living Delirium
[0:49:39] <+OhioNitsud> that would be funny
[0:49:42] <%valriot> FUCK DELIRIUM, ITS AWFUL
[0:49:42] <$QueequegTheater> Dark Knight needs more good buttons
[0:49:42] <%X2Eliah> @dan_g_v unspecified back problems
[0:49:42] <%Divryne> That's fine my idea was dumb anyways.
[0:49:49] <skewerstar> Doppelganger DT!?

[0:49:55] <Owkono> The Darkerest night
[0:49:55] <postmortempc> Woolie got his back broken the way Paige does.... pats dong
[0:49:56] <PMda2nd> woolie goes full Rick James on pats bed
[0:49:57] <%X2Eliah> @dan_g_v safe to assume, some kind of lower back related pain
[0:49:57] <%TheYellowcouch> BARD GANG BARD GAND
[0:49:58] <%chance_h> Imagine woolie air juggling the pillows
[0:49:59] <dan_g_v> eesh poor Woolie
[0:50:01] <iosephe> yep
[0:50:01] <$RealThiele> oh jesus at 30 theres nothing there
[0:50:07] <mr_red117> yeah
[0:50:07] <@SSaryn> Bards are also not a thing people really wanna play because its not fun.
[0:50:11] <Srthunda> its more like a knife mansion honestly
[0:50:11] <$QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Especially when you're a roe with 3 popotoes
[0:50:12] <+Figleafplays> very true
[0:50:15] <%CalderGaming> bards don't get full stance rotation until AFTER ARR it's HORRIBLE
[0:50:15] <%walternatorz> sentient knives*
[0:50:18] <+Rolandknight> Are you going to go bad to woolie‚Äôs place now you both have your 5G shots?
[0:50:32] <+Memequisition> dancer does what i wish bard did
[0:50:36] <%JustBlubs> The toddlers WILL stab themselves
[0:50:40] <dan_g_v> @x2eliah thanks
[0:50:43] <%Jaxnos> neither does Woolie, right?
[0:50:46] <$RealThiele> he needs trianglulation shots
[0:50:46] <%Dapper_Cactuar> archer/bard is boring as hell from 15 to 35
[0:50:54] <wibbwobbler> Endwalker is coming
[0:50:58] <Owkono> never leave the house
[0:50:58] <$QueequegTheater> Pat is trying to figure out how to literally never leave that couch
[0:51:00] <OldManDeckardCain> let's pretend to be shocked Kappa
[0:51:01] <@commanderclaw> Or underwear
[0:51:06] <%baka_sugoi> L A Z Y
[0:51:06] <%captainpodock> But Pat you have to go outside
[0:51:07] <%KineticZen> Maybe Gief would like to visit
[0:51:09] <lazysaiyajin> heritage
[0:51:10] <+SoySocks> the boy changes things
[0:51:13] <%Jaxnos> that's on purpose
[0:51:13] <%walternatorz> Pat, when was the last time you wore "regular" clothes?
[0:51:13] <%Movemeister> LUL
[0:51:14] <%X2Eliah> Myeah that's not great
[0:51:14] <%nomos42> Gief does add content to the pod
[0:51:15] <$RealThiele> fishnets are pretty hot
[0:51:16] <nicegrandmafingers> bard is boring until like 64
[0:51:18] <@SSaryn> Does it usually feel like 80 or 90
[0:51:20] <%cvp5127> moist
[0:51:21] <%weissguard> ugh, and then you're in the cold
[0:51:22] <dan_g_v> Pat can always wear his fishnets
[0:51:22] <%TheYellowcouch> insert swamp woolie meme here
[0:51:23] <$QueequegTheater> Pat you need human interaction
[0:51:26] <odnucaf3> Woolie¬¥s house is in Heaven, of course is Hot.
[0:51:27] <postmortempc> Pat asked to leave the house, responds with no like we all expected
[0:51:29] <afronooch> cause woolie got the drip
[0:51:30] <%coward_man> yeah it was noticeable on the old videos that you were sweating like fuck
[0:51:32] <HollowMan190> oh no...no more dog....truly a sad time for the pod cast
[0:51:32] <@SSaryn> or excuse me, 30 or 35
[0:51:35] <DianaTheAscian> bard is boring the whole way through
[0:51:37] <%solracc25> Drip
[0:51:37] <%spitelite> release the orb mid podcast
[0:51:39] <%Rumbutt> The Heaven or Hell aesthetic that the podcast gets from the separate locations is great too
[0:51:41] <%sakeydo> fucking shute in. He'll never leave the house again. Lol
[0:51:42] <%captainpodock> does regular clothes equal jeans?
[0:51:46] <Nupinoop296> understandable
[0:51:50] <@SSaryn> Knockout City is genuinely ok
[0:51:51] <%X2Eliah> Ok but Woolie is literally from Grenada, ofc he wants the temperature to be warm
[0:51:52] <%HitchhikingThrough> It is important to go outside on occasion, & I say that as someone who loathes the outside
[0:51:52] <%KineticZen> I saw Max's stream of Knockout City, looked pretty fun
[0:51:55] <%valriot> It actually looks cool, Max played it, it was a riot
[0:51:56] <+BIumen> was that the game with the terrible trailer?
[0:51:59] <%ClericOfSparda> when's the last time you wore normal clothes that didn't involve Gief?
[0:52:06] <$RealThiele> EA can publish good games if they stay the hell away from the dev
[0:52:06] <Strongfish91> sub radditz
[0:52:07] <%whyskeywolfe> Saw you dunking on Marvel comics the other day, so here's some more. Marvel had a bit of a problem with diversity on their comics side. So a few years ago they promoted a promising young writer from Japan called Akira Yoshida to help open up the East-Asian market. The only problem is Akira Yoshida doesn't exist; he's actually a white guy called CB Cebulski who pretended to be Japanese to get work, including creating his entire highschool history. He's currently Editor-in-Chief of Marvel Comics.
[0:52:08] <dan_g_v> max said it was fun
[0:52:10] <%slapjones> slapjones subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 7 months! Does biomutant look appealing to you at all?
[0:52:14] <%Daxalog> Yeah Knockout City was cool. People dismissed it cause of the kinda off e3 trailer
[0:52:20] <$QueequegTheater> WE HAVE TO PAINT HIM RED SO HE HEALS FASTAH
[0:52:21] <plaguedoctor_syan> speaking of which how he? missing his balls? Did he do something funny because of anesteric?
[0:52:25] <T_Sasquatch> It's actually fun
[0:52:29] <%TheYellowcouch> just insert a steel bar
[0:52:30] <TheShockVox> There‚Äôs an amount of lag that makes the back and forth not as on point as when it‚Äôs in person, so that‚Äôs a bummer. But I am surprised how decent the back and forth has been since covid
[0:52:35] <$QueequegTheater> Julius
[0:52:37] <$RealThiele> woolie needs new biogel between his discs, harvest some from children
[0:52:38] <%Valdorick> Belmonts, 100%
[0:52:38] <%HitchhikingThrough> oooh
[0:52:38] <%NocturneNovember> So how bad do you think this new relic grinding is gonna be?
[0:52:40] <%walternatorz> what if a vertebrae is like jenga?
[0:52:43] <Ipsenscastle> Geralt
[0:52:43] <ThatGuyThere03> Julius
[0:52:43] <+evbites> belmonts
[0:52:44] <%HitchhikingThrough> Really?
[0:52:44] <%TheYellowcouch> Can geralt beat a grand cross ?
[0:52:45] <%baka_sugoi> but Belmont
[0:52:45] <$Afterman_> juste would kick geralts ass
[0:52:45] <+BIumen> geralt is just magic belmont
[0:52:45] <Sunstalker> Geralt fully on drugs is strong
[0:52:46] <%X2Eliah> ... Geralt
[0:52:46] <T_Sasquatch> @daxalog im one of those people.  Shit marketing
[0:52:47] <%Frost_Quill> WOULD he though?
[0:52:49] <Dr_Mooose> eeehhh
[0:52:50] <$QueequegTheater> Julius Belmont
[0:52:51] <%HitchhikingThrough> I don't know much about castlevania
[0:52:51] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Geralt is broken, as much as I love the Belmonts
[0:52:52] <ullyzeez> BRUH
[0:52:52] <OldManDeckardCain> depends on which belmont
[0:52:53] <+Dorf1> some of the belmonts are fucked up and own firearms
[0:52:55] <bob900000> geralt
[0:52:58] <%KineticZen> Belmonts have the range with the whips and the powerups and the thing but not Signs
[0:52:59] <aeonicvector> Ehhh Geralt is BIG busted, but Julius exists
[0:53:02] <TheAntiNihilist> lol
[0:53:03] <+Cactuskris> he is not faster than alucard
[0:53:03] <postmortempc> But Gabriel Belmont
[0:53:04] <%GarbageNirvana> Geralt's like Batman, give him enough preparation and he'll beat anyone
[0:53:05] <samuraicaveman> Geralt would be more willing to kill his opponent
[0:53:05] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt did you like s4?
[0:53:06] <Tukaru> You need to name a proper Belmont
[0:53:06] <%valriot> Belmonts fight Death, Pat
[0:53:06] <$Afterman_> Geralt cannot take down an elder vampire though, Belmonts can.
[0:53:07] <%X2Eliah> Geralt has actual superpowers + he has magic elixirs
[0:53:08] <Crimpson> I love how people call getting their relic a "grind" when you don't have to grind anything.
[0:53:08] <+Cactuskris> lol
[0:53:08] <TheShockVox> @whyskeywolfe Holy shit, I forgot about that!!
[0:53:11] <+picante_papi> Okay but can he kill Dracula?
[0:53:11] <$QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Julius isn't
[0:53:12] <Tukaru> Because some are better than others
[0:53:12] <@commanderclaw> But grand cross tho
[0:53:13] <ullyzeez> belmonts can do grand cross
[0:53:13] <$RealThiele> Trever originally was too till cowardess
[0:53:14] <OldManDeckardCain> EH
[0:53:15] <odnucaf3> But Dracula!
[0:53:17] <ThatGuyThere03> are you absolutely sure about that pat?
[0:53:19] <+Dorf1> the belmonts can stop time
[0:53:19] <%solracc25> TOSS A COIN TO YOUR WITCHER
[0:53:20] <Isord> Could he beat Julius Belmont?
[0:53:22] <SailingSaturn> But Dracula is Superhuman cirNom
[0:53:23] <lyzejag> Julius is a fucking superhuman
[0:53:24] <%Frost_Quill> Gerald vs full power Soma?
[0:53:24] <+BubbaRands> Geralt has magic bullshit superhuman powers
[0:53:25] <Dunmarkh> Belmonts can't jump for shit
[0:53:27] <T_Sasquatch> Im thinking of video game geralt LUL
[0:53:28] <%baka_sugoi> cuz HUMAN
[0:53:29] <dan_g_v> belmont are biblical strong
[0:53:30] <%TheYellowcouch> good point
[0:53:30] <+evbites> ohhh yeah
[0:53:31] <+xerj> Witcher Castle War 1999
[0:53:32] <Sunstalker> Afterman_ An elder vampire in Witcher is whole other thing then one in castelvania, man
[0:53:32] <+NicDaGuy> Geralt is literally slower than the main antagonist
[0:53:32] <%Frost_Quill> Geralt
[0:53:34] <BlueLunecy> Untrue! Some games have a gun
[0:53:34] <$Afterman_> witchers cant fuck with the elder vampires though, blood and wine shows as much
[0:53:35] <balthazar758> sick whip
[0:53:35] <%Valdorick> I don't know, he's a WITCHer, they could work!
[0:53:35] <odnucaf3> Oh yeah, that is true.
[0:53:36] <%X2Eliah> Geralt is SO COOL
[0:53:36] <+BubbaRands> It would be a hype fight tho
[0:53:36] <Dr_Mooose> a weapon is a weapon
[0:53:37] <+Cactuskris> a whip still works on him#
[0:53:38] <$QueequegTheater> Julius could do it
[0:53:38] <postmortempc> Still human? Gabriel Belmont
[0:53:39] <%Dapper_Cactuar> wouldn't they not fight and instead would work together to fight monsters?
[0:53:40] <%moonmintparadise> Yeah but a flaming morningstar is sstill a flaming morningstar
[0:53:42] <pmaratsuper> @Afterman_ He can, and I think he does.
[0:53:43] <%coward_man> not Gabriel Belmont, think about it
[0:53:43] <%weissguard> So what's the distinction then between a Witcher dude and a regular human?
[0:53:43] <+Cactuskris> he can be cut
[0:53:43] <%YakumoYomi> Geralt ain't surviving an item crash
[0:53:43] <%justcallmebobplease> Julius is a Julius, he isn't a human.
[0:53:44] <%TheYellowcouch> But every magic geralt has affects humans
[0:53:45] <$QueequegTheater> Neither is Dracula
[0:53:45] <Ipsenscastle> but Alucard would tear Geralt up
[0:53:49] <+Cactuskris> you are so wrong
[0:53:49] <+NicDaGuy> The whip absolutely
[0:53:50] <PMda2nd> the whip wouldn't work?
[0:53:50] <dan_g_v> like able to hold back mountains strong belmont
[0:53:52] <TheAntiNihilist> but Geralt HATES church
[0:53:55] <$RealThiele> neither are half the shit belmonts fight
[0:53:55] <$QueequegTheater> NO HE ISN'T
[0:53:56] <OldManDeckardCain> geralt was literally killed by a peasant
[0:53:56] <lyzejag> Yeah but Soma can use GUN
[0:53:59] <Tukaru> Julius might have a good running because War of 1999 bullshit
[0:54:00] <favadem> The Belmonts have the power of god and anime by their side!!!
[0:54:01] <$QueequegTheater> PAT, I AM CATHOLIC
[0:54:01] <+Rolandknight> He‚Äôs the pirate right?
[0:54:03] <%brickwall35> Dracula is in the Bible
[0:54:04] <$QueequegTheater> NO HE IS NOT
[0:54:04] <%KineticZen> Doesn't most of the arsenal not work on Drac in the show
[0:54:05] <%moonmintparadise> Geralt is a Mutant, not a Monster
[0:54:06] <TheGammaBear> Dracula is supposed to be the son of Satan or some shit
[0:54:06] <$RealThiele> MERMAN FROM THE BIBBLE
[0:54:07] <+picante_papi> Dr acula LUL
[0:54:08] <TheShockVox> Then why can‚Äôt the GAME be like that?
[0:54:08] <ThatGuyThere03> well, yes and no
[0:54:09] <$Afterman_> @pmaratsuper No he gets killed by one if he keeps asking it questions. he gets annoyed at geralt
[0:54:09] <%MisterRockett> Alucard tho.
[0:54:09] <+DevilsBeddPost> geralt still loses to farmers with pointy spears tho
[0:54:10] <+Pachi3000> Dr. Acula MD
[0:54:10] <%X2Eliah> ?
[0:54:10] <%KishinGrek> death isn't a biblical demon
[0:54:13] <iosephe> what
[0:54:14] <+NicDaGuy> Soooo the guy who can kill a biblical demon is gonna lose?!
[0:54:16] <odnucaf3> Dracula is almost the Devil.
[0:54:20] <%X2Eliah> Wait the bibble has dracula?
[0:54:21] <ThatGuyThere03> he's more accurately a host to a primordial force of chaos
[0:54:23] <$Afterman_> @Sunstalker idk dracula seems like hed be an Elder vampire
[0:54:23] <bob900000> what?
[0:54:24] <%walternatorz> not the satan juice
[0:54:24] <@StridentSong> Axe, Dagger and Watch would work. Holy Water and Cross would not. Richter could at least get some edge with Crashes, but his strongest ones would do nothing
[0:54:24] <%TheYellowcouch> I mean Dracula is just son of demon so
[0:54:26] <+evbites> @weissguard lives for 100's of years and is super strong infertile and resistant to poisen
[0:54:29] <+Cactuskris> you are crazy
[0:54:31] <%MelBrooksKA> Gerry has a -5 to pitchforks
[0:54:31] <Rei_Dsoto> I duno, you call down the power of faith hard enough you can blow up just about anything
[0:54:31] <%mister___doctor> What about Sypha
[0:54:32] <$QueequegTheater> THAT'S VERY NOT CORRECT
[0:54:33] <%baka_sugoi> DA DEBELL
[0:54:35] <+DevilsBeddPost> like geralt in the books STILL gets his ass beat every so often by some dude
[0:54:38] <favadem> Could Geralt beat Goku tho?
[0:54:41] <+Cactuskris> if youc ant keep up with alucard you can take geralt
[0:54:41] <erogenousjones> @QueequegTheater the curse of cain in the bible is where vampires come from
[0:54:41] <%chance_h> Yum
[0:54:42] <ullyzeez> okay but can geralt fight death??
[0:54:43] <@commanderclaw> Prosthetic balls are next level
[0:54:43] <atsu333> What you don't remember in the book of John when Jesus smote Dracula?
[0:54:44] <+NicDaGuy> Geralt no chance against Dracula
[0:54:46] <%X2Eliah> LED GAMER NUTS

[1:13:18] <greene411> He was more of an eternal lizardman to be fair
[1:13:19] <ScreamLord> Prince Philip was either a Lich or a Fallout Ghoul
[1:13:19] <TyphoonSwirl> the royal family are dark souls bosses irl
[1:13:20] <alroy900> it was a Lich, and its phylactery was finally destroyed
[1:13:20] <+saltytyrz> The urchins are finally safe
[1:13:21] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Also, completely ignoring who they were as people, the Prince got to live twice as long as Miura
[1:13:22] <postmortempc> Kentaro miura > prince Philip
[1:13:23] <tanarath> pat isn't wrong
[1:13:28] <@CreepyPorpoise> also prince phillip was like 200 years old
[1:13:34] <@mothmandraws> just make coils trust
[1:13:35] <Nupinoop296> THEY SHOULD NOT BE OPTIONAL
[1:13:35] <%TheYellowcouch> Coils was fun to do solo unzynced
[1:13:36] <$RealThiele> never did coils LUL
[1:13:36] <+RealMisterJ> The story of Coils is amazing, but also fuck doing them
[1:13:36] <%velemi> they should be in the raid roulette
[1:13:36] <%MisterRockett> Coils is SO IMPORTANT.
[1:13:36] <%seoliart> Coils genuinely has a really good story
[1:13:45] <%TheYellowcouch> except for that one fight
[1:13:48] <@JustinianKnight> good chance coils might get some sorta revamp or roulette
[1:13:49] <%shurtal> you can solo a large chunk of it
[1:13:56] <Nupinoop296> just make everyone unsync it and done
[1:14:03] <%LaughingCatt> Coils being so integral yet so hard to complete is why Alexander was just kinda irrelevant to the main story until later expansions happened
[1:14:06] <+jau_twitch> god i still gotta do coils
[1:14:09] <%TheYellowcouch> The cutscenes are so long and so important
[1:14:09] <animeshaquilleoneil> Super important but can't be solo'd entirely.
[1:14:11] <TioXyco> coils lore is REALLY good
[1:14:13] <inksmears> it's such huge character development for the twins too
[1:14:16] <+jau_twitch> solo'd as far as T9
[1:14:16] <CheesesSliced> Prince Philip was a real OG. That is; Old Guy
[1:14:17] <+RealMisterJ> @shurtal You can solo it all up until raid 8
[1:14:19] <%seoliart> That CGI cutscene was reallllly good
[1:14:20] <Psyramics> you can solo damn near all of it, only T9 is tricky
[1:14:20] <Nupinoop296> T9 still sucks ass though
[1:14:21] <TioXyco> and that's a 1.0 ending cutscene
[1:14:22] <+jau_twitch> wait it has WHAT
[1:14:23] <%TheYellowcouch> even if you have to deal with old Alphi and Alisaie VAs
[1:14:23] <$RealThiele> trust raid for it would be great
[1:14:24] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Technically RDM and WAR can solo it right now, but once the number squish happens that will change
[1:14:24] <+atteroproxy> If you run coils unsynched its not a problem
[1:14:24] <+BIumen> nael give nightmare
[1:14:25] <%MisterRockett> Wasn't the Coils the first series by the current Shadowbringers head writer?
[1:14:26] <%0rond> it's weird too, doesn't fit in with the rest of the raid series, it's not just boss fights , and it's 13 instead of 12
[1:14:29] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt also music
[1:14:29] <%AEUG_Ace_Kamille> T9 is pain.
[1:14:32] <%Xelhesia> Alisae was awesome too. and still is
[1:14:32] <EvanDude47> its the only ingame thing to have a cg cutscene PERIOD
[1:14:36] <%MisterRockett> The one who's written EVERYTHING fantastic about FFXIV?
[1:14:39] <+choopercabra> I did coils recently, was able to do it solo unsynced except for one boss fight.

[1:15:11] <TioXyco> @0rond on of the turns in the first coil was jsut a labirynth of jump puzzles you had to complete... EVERY WEEK, to not lose loot
[1:15:13] <T_Sasquatch> It's sooo fucking important
[1:15:15] <parkslady> LUL
[1:15:18] <Psyramics> if you can't solo T9, set up a PF and get someone else to help you with it

[1:15:21] <%QueequegTheater> @0rond it's tough but a WAR with 510+ ilvl can do it
[1:15:21] <@commanderclaw> Paige's mind is an enigma
[1:15:24] <%TheYellowcouch> we all need to sometimes go "Yes honey"
[1:15:25] <DianaTheAscian> why is paige?

[1:16:39] <KickflipShinobi> new lore to me
[1:16:39] <%spitelite> while not believing in ghosts
[1:16:39] <KinduVborrd> ... I feel there are other people Abe could want to haunt more.
[1:16:39] <+Masked_Hero_Lucky> She's not afraid of the ghosts of other presidents?
[1:16:40] <%Valdorick> Shouldn't she be afraid of Jefferson!? Or Jackson!?
[1:16:40] <%JoshManVGH> That was a great stream
[1:16:40] <+Kharinite> Abe is out here emancipating her darkest fears
[1:16:41] <bob900000> don't take her to Mount Rushmore
[1:16:42] <%dekkitout> This was revealed months ago
[1:16:43] <%Movemeister> the 5 dollar bit is
[1:16:44] <$RealThiele> new, no. deep, yes
[1:16:44] <erogenousjones> what does she do if someone is gonna give her 5 dollars when giving her change?
[1:16:44] <Ner234> LUL
[1:16:46] <%KeiganOfAstora> Recent lore
[1:16:46] <%vexion_smh> she literally addressed this before
[1:16:46] <%OswaldTheDog> I‚Äôd be more afraid of Mary Todd‚Äôs ghost, Peach
[1:16:47] <%JoshManVGH> So many discoveries.
[1:16:47] <%Pappajimbo> like the venture brothers?
[1:16:48] <+froduck42> But she's not scared of washington or Franklin?
[1:16:49] <%AEUG_Ace_Kamille> This is new lore.
[1:16:50] <nivlac_555> this was a whole stream segment
[1:16:50] <%Bailey__gaming> Wait Till she finds out about The Imortal on Invincible!
[1:16:51] <T_Sasquatch> ????
[1:16:52] <+Rolandknight> Why
[1:16:52] <+Catpurnicus> you should call her aaron burr by the way she's dropping hamiltons
[1:16:53] <balthazar758> there's a YouTube clip about it
[1:16:54] <Mangahero18> check the wiki
[1:16:55] <%blastazoid00> I've been watching you guys for years and this is the first ive heard of this LUL
[1:16:56] <%KeiganOfAstora> What about Jackie O?
[1:16:56] <WakeUpThrow> i swear, most Paige lore sounds like a bit
[1:16:59] <koffeemancer> yeah abe lincoln is her paralysis demon or something right?
[1:16:59] <%Frost_Quill> So she's not afraid of George Washington ghost???
[1:17:00] <%walternatorz> Man, I thought I was caught up on the lore.
[1:17:01] <%dekkitout> Mt Rushmore is her Stand, American Woman
[1:17:02] <+washicka> Wait but why specifically Abe?
[1:17:02] <@mothmandraws> there is someone in gangos in a nuts good baseball uniform glam
[1:17:07] <i_chevalier> it's a super real thing. lol
[1:17:08] <orbulon> @walternatorz can confirm being from illinois, it is not
[1:17:11] <KennySD> Is she scared of his ghost because of that part in Black Dynamite?
[1:17:25] <$RealThiele> so shouldnt paige carry a small picture of john wilkes booth to scare abe off?
[1:17:28] <greene411> Is it ANYTHING with Abe Lincoln? How does she feel about Mount Rushmore??
[1:17:29] <%Maids4lyfe> if she's afraid of Lincoln ghost wait until she hears all the other presidents on american money are also dead
[1:17:30] <%Valdorick> As someone who had epilepsy... Fuck 'em
[1:17:31] <CheesesSliced> Yet she's fine with George Washington?
[1:17:34] <%Frost_Quill> Why Abe Lincoln SPECIFICALLY?
[1:17:41] <%QueequegTheater> There's a reason epileptics aren't allowed to drive.  It's not their fault, but it's too risky
[1:17:43] <%vexion_smh> Abe ghosted her when she's a kid I think?
[1:17:46] <%Frost_Quill> I'm doing the red mage weapon and PLD weapon.
[1:17:50] <%QueequegTheater> DON'T DO IT
[1:17:54] <DianaTheAscian> Cause hes tall???

[1:25:20] <%ClericOfSparda> FFXIV doesn't let you integrate anything unless it's running in admin mode. it sucks
[1:25:22] <mrjplays2k9> Has it been revealed what the last weapon grind is gonna be or if it involves mettle?

[1:27:45] <+FingaLights> Ye i'm getting some rollback
[1:27:59] <DianaTheAscian> how is Pat getting all this different music?
[1:28:08] <Isord> 3 tanks 2 healers?
[1:28:08] <Mangahero18> @PatStaresAt You could try going into task manager and setting OBS as higher priority than FF14? Would that help any?
[1:28:10] <%KineticZen> Hope we get to see you kick Gabriel/Lyon/Sartauvoir's ass
[1:28:14] <+cascadepersona> A bunch of times when Castrum pops, no one in my instance queues for it.

[1:31:01] <%QueequegTheater> Is chat really a value add at all though
[1:31:06] <%JoshManVGH> @patstaresat What happens if you middle click on chat while FFXIV is in focus?
[1:31:09] <%KineticZen> Cleared DRS 10 times, only just won Gabriel yesterday
[1:31:09] <$Thatghostpepper> that aspect ratio was for ants
[1:31:14] <rebaaaahhh> LOL it's always the 0 seconds
[1:31:21] <AnnaBanana> Second monitor just quits working?
[1:31:26] <%CzeekyTV> Hmmm the rare Unleash opener. Bold move, Pat.
[1:31:29] <%shurtal> the way your name in the party roster gets abbreviated makes you look like a knock off Japanese Mech anime
[1:31:34] <%QueequegTheater> Must be some DPS-heavy parties in here, jesus
[1:31:38] <%JoshManVGH> Meeeeealt.
[1:31:45] <AnnaBanana> I had problems if the refresh rates of both my monitors being different

[1:32:47] <%CzeekyTV> Use Lost Reflect for Red Choctober
[1:32:52] <DianaTheAscian> Yes
[1:32:56] <%CalderGaming> it feels very satisfying to master the choctober pattern
[1:32:56] <%shurtal> Koji has way too much fun naming things
[1:32:58] <TioXyco> it's a lot going on at the same time, it gets confusing

[1:33:57] <Jaysky> Be cautious of phone Pat, it'll just disconnect you from chat at random too
[1:33:58] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Watching the party erupt into dumb mounts after the fight was great.
[1:33:59] <+TaylOctopus91> Probably. FF XIV is extra thirsty for dat juice
[1:34:02] <TioXyco> watch the duel for the mettle bonus

[1:34:55] <%LaughingCatt> wow the sheer revulsion in your voice LUL
[1:35:03] <BluBox> Wow that looks like it's from another era alright
[1:35:10] <Jaysky> Looks awful but it works
[1:35:11] <%CalderGaming> @0rond you don't need ot be capped you have to get through the fight without picking up any vuln stacks (i.e. dodge all dodgeable AOEs)
[1:35:12] <%Vibe__Lord> oh god it looks like windows 98
[1:35:15] <bigshedman> Oh my lord that is an ugly fucking W98 looking application.
[1:35:25] <Lynxystem> TC Chat is a bit cleaner UI wise

[1:36:48] <Ner234> ENHANCE
[1:36:52] <%X2Eliah> @PatStaresAt You just reduce the monitor resolution
[1:36:57] <SPidERMan8576> The smol stream
[1:37:00] <Jaysky> Unsure on Chatterino
[1:37:01] <%SunnyVarietyPack> he means your penis
[1:37:09] <%BoxNavy> do it
[1:37:10] <Jaysky> Only know Chatty
[1:37:13] <%vivaldiva> set monitor to 800x600
[1:37:19] <rytisone> the one weird trick to make your chat bigger
[1:37:19] <AnnaBanana> There is an issue if the refresh rates on both monitors not being the same
[1:37:24] <%SirGO0SE> MAXIMUM
[1:37:31] <+ChaosAethr> it would be funny if pat aggro a star enemy set it up
[1:37:34] <%vexion_smh> yay
[1:37:37] <%walternatorz> yay we're big
[1:37:40] <+GIGA255> The size of your font will depend on the size of your courtyard and water source.
[1:37:41] <NitronStreams> font size: girthy
[1:37:43] <%X2Eliah> So all fixed now?
[1:37:43] <Jaysky> Don't forget font settings as Comic Sans

[1:38:14] <%KineticZen> Tech support strim inc
[1:38:21] <%walternatorz> psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin
[1:38:29] <Jaysky> Some games just don't allow pass through chat for obs for whatever reason
[1:38:36] <DanThePumpkinman> someone said something about different refresh rates maybe?
[1:38:47] <%ClericOfSparda> I really want to that mount but I don't want to level DPS
[1:38:49] <+GIGA255> Pat, did you buy the Bozja Mount Speed map for 25 Clusters?
[1:38:54] <DanThePumpkinman> iunno
[1:38:56] <Nupinoop296> gosh i wish Bozja wasn't this kind of content. i'm really interested in the story/lore
[1:38:56] <+Jakeofalco> @PatStaresAt do you do much savage content?
[1:39:02] <%KineticZen> You know I did have this problem when I had monitors running at different refresh rates like years ago
[1:39:05] <+GIGA255> Yes
[1:39:07] <%KineticZen> Videos would stutter
[1:39:13] <+GIGA255> chages everything
[1:39:19] <AnnaBanana> You want both monitors running at the same refresh rate
[1:39:19] <Jaysky> Like when I did Doom 2016 it didn't let me use chat, but Celeste was fine
[1:39:20] <wibbwobbler> Ram? Honestly Idk lol
[1:39:21] <%Dapper_Cactuar> yep, 25 clusters I htink
[1:39:26] <%blastazoid00> @PatStaresAt Did you get the whale mount?
[1:39:27] <AnnaBanana> Otherwise it will cause issues with obs
[1:39:28] <+ChaosAethr> Pat does not do any savage raid
[1:39:31] <InboundFromSpace> 25 clusters
[1:39:33] <%CalderGaming> oh neat
[1:39:39] <InboundFromSpace> Game changer for farms
[1:39:40] <AnnaBanana> It's a windows problems
[1:39:44] <%CalderGaming> does that map stack with the gear speed bonus?
[1:39:47] <Jaysky> Also I'm gonna head out
[1:39:49] <%blastazoid00> yeyeyeye
[1:39:49] <%shurtal> maybe
[1:39:49] <+Captbutt> oh shit i just saw the team ninja final fantasy
[1:39:51] <%Evil_Emu147> Glorious!
[1:39:51] <%BoxNavy> yeyeye
[1:39:52] <%X2Eliah> YUCK
[1:39:54] <DianaTheAscian> its cheap as well
[1:39:57] <+tigerfang86> nice whale
[1:40:00] <%X2Eliah> OH GOD THAT IS NOT GOOD
[1:40:00] <Ner234> W H A L E
[1:40:00] <+tigerfang86> Nice dumbass whale
[1:40:01] <AnnaBanana> That's what happened with me
[1:40:02] <$Afterman_> pat riding his orb around
[1:40:04] <Jaysky> Breaks over back to stocking groceries
[1:40:07] <lostvayne91> SPACE WHALE
[1:40:09] <Mangahero18> IT LOOKS SO DUMB
[1:40:10] <EvanDude47> the whale makes you whale
[1:40:10] <%maybefalco> the whale was way cheaper than i thought it was going to be
[1:40:11] <AnnaBanana> Dunno if it would be the same issue
[1:40:14] <+MayorRev> HEY DONT BULLY WHALE
[1:40:16] <CalderGaming> show the whale bepis
[1:40:31] <%KineticZen> It's so good
[1:40:34] <afronooch> yeah its newish
[1:40:35] <Zebroneath> too big to be called a whale......
[1:40:36] <%valriot> In like, 5.5
[1:40:41] <DianaTheAscian> wow thats big
[1:40:45] <orbulon> GOD I WANT DEMI OZMA SO MUCH
[1:40:54] <%KineticZen> added alongside mettle for castrum clears and dr clears
[1:40:54] <Mangahero18> Was that guy back up there sitting on fucking OZMA from Final Fantasy 9?!
[1:40:56] <penitentpendant> It was added as part of the QoL pass, so recently
[1:41:03] <InboundFromSpace> Just added in 5.5 apparently
[1:41:09] <+gutlesscoward> there's also an essence that increases mount speed a little
[1:41:34] <%cvp5127> did you get ME on steam or origin?
[1:41:35] <rytisone> needs faster internet Kappa
[1:41:37] <%CalderGaming> yeah demi ozma mount is from the Eureka end dungeon iirc
[1:41:45] <%X2Eliah> ... Could it be due to some MMO anticheat software running and blocking twitch chat?
[1:41:52] <%StryderStrikesAt> obligatory joke blaming it on WOW some how
[1:41:54] <nicegrandmafingers> you get an ozma mount from eureka
[1:42:00] <%NopeBadguy> Gonna try duels?
[1:42:09] <Azathotic> @X2Eliah lmao 14 does not have anticheat
[1:42:14] <+MayorRev> Worms armageddon
[1:42:18] <%GIGA255> GIGA255 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 1 month streak! I know you hate Lalafell, Pat, but I hope you can at least agree they are acceptable as Onion Knights.
[1:42:19] <theinfamousq> those look like cyst-y dongers
[1:42:34] <AnnaBanana> I dunno, do you have antivirus software?
[1:42:37] <%GIGA255> Darn.
[1:42:38] <DianaTheAscian> are these worms the best cluster farm?
[1:43:07] <@CreepyPorpoise> not clusters
[1:43:07] <@JustinianKnight> theyre not cluster
[1:43:12] <@JustinianKnight> fragments
[1:43:15] <$Ziegsy> nah, best cluster farm is mechs
[1:43:16] <%CalderGaming> the "best" cluster farm if you have the numbers for it is to run one region in every third of the map
[1:43:18] <%NopeBadguy> worms are for fragments
[1:43:18] <Frogwash> The chat issue seems to be a resource allocation problem, maybe set the tab it's in to a higher priority in task manager?
[1:43:21] <@CreepyPorpoise> biiiig difference
[1:43:22] <%NopeBadguy> clusters drop from magitek mobs
[1:43:30] <%NopeBadguy> there's a loop in the second area i like to use
[1:43:48] <Mangahero18> Hey pat are you gonna make a bun boy alt when that update comes out? You can FEEL the THIRST.
[1:43:49] <%CalderGaming> shit i was thinking of clusters too
[1:44:02] <+ChaosAethr> it seam like its either a windows issue or a cache issue on the chat not working
[1:44:07] <%NopeBadguy> oh right is your bozjan gear all augmented
[1:44:12] <%JoshManVGH> But it would be a Windows solution!
[1:44:33] <atsu333> Since it works in loading screens I'd think maybe GPU-based but GPU shouldn't be invovled in loading chat through OBS

[1:46:17] <%NopeBadguy> @Rumbutt microsoft edge
[1:46:19] <AsterKalix> @PatStaresAt Is it faster to grind loathesomes through CT raids or through Bozja as solo?
[1:46:20] <+Catpurnicus> Edge was the worst endgame character in FFIV
[1:46:21] <balthazar758> cause you live on the edge pat
[1:46:25] <theinfamousq> those jizzbags keep trying to turn edge back on

[1:47:32] <%Maids4lyfe> windows I bet
[1:47:33] <Srthunda> has the source of the curse been found?
[1:47:36] <Azathotic> @Nkmucci Theres no class restrictions in Bozja
[1:47:39] <%JoshManVGH> Windows Update?
[1:47:42] <+Catpurnicus> it fucked up everyone's shit
[1:47:45] <%GIGA255> these sorts of technical difficulties on every PC stream I watch always leaves me hesitant about investing in a high end one.

[1:48:02] <+tigerfang86> you ever just give up
[1:48:03] <Nordguy> no
[1:48:05] <Felto3> is game mode off?
[1:48:08] <%X2Eliah> .... It DIDNT work? LUL
[1:48:16] <%cvp5127> always give up
[1:48:17] <%HitchhikingThrough> man chat breaking sucks
[1:48:25] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> I'm sure glad windows is never invasive or disruptive
[1:48:25] <%LailahQueenx> My sound wants to come through the monitor instead of my speakers now thx windows update
[1:48:31] <%JoshManVGH> Nobody else who streams has this issue?
[1:48:31] <+tigerfang86> you ever just give up cause failure is crushingly real
[1:48:35] <dan_g_v> replicant
[1:48:39] <%seoliart> CRAZY TALK
[1:48:43] <Azathotic> @AsterKalix tbf, its rng but even getting one memory in the amount of time id take to run a raid makes it better timewise, plus clusters and mettle
[1:48:44] <Dunmarkh> you are crazy and blind
[1:48:47] <%X2Eliah> Yeah it must be frustrating
[1:48:47] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[1:48:47] <AnnaBanana> Always blame windows XD
[1:48:47] <%NopeBadguy> well i mean...
[1:48:49] <BluBox> Chat isn't real
[1:48:50] <%HitchhikingThrough> yeah I know the feeling
[1:48:55] <Dr_Mooose> were we ever really there?
[1:48:55] <%X2Eliah> It's like streaming with 0 audience
[1:48:58] <no123450n> pat is becoming boomer
[1:49:01] <+Catpurnicus> this sounds like abe lincoln's ghost's fault
[1:49:02] <fudgsicles117> streaming to the void
[1:49:04] <Jontman42> there never was a chat Pat, it's always been just you, alone and crazy
[1:49:07] <vicious_rage> Not gonna cry about Miura, "At least Casca survived", CRY A LOT BibleThump
[1:49:08] <+D00msDayDan> the curse has been reversed and now chat doesn't exist
[1:49:13] <Dunmarkh> so a let's play
[1:49:16] <%BoxNavy> 0 viewers jermaPluto
[1:49:18] <ItsPastas> You get used to it...
[1:49:19] <%JoshManVGH> How does Reb Ford view chat when streaming FFXIV?
[1:49:24] <%cvp5127> we're not real pat
[1:49:27] <%NopeBadguy> are you sure we're even people and not just textbots
[1:49:28] <Slim_Lipid> weak streamer not forged in the fires of 0 viewer just chatting streams
[1:49:30] <%Daxalog> Enjoy the no viewer new to twitch streaming experience
[1:49:35] <AnnaBanana> Is it just chat?
[1:49:45] <+BigChiefBear> 2 monitorys prob
[1:49:47] <%Daxalog> Cant you use your phone?
[1:49:50] <%blastazoid00> Could be
[1:49:56] <AsterKalix> @Azathotic I had a feeling that was the case and was only doing CT raids for the new tomes until I could get a definite answer
[1:49:57] <%X2Eliah> .... what's a game mode?
[1:50:19] <%JoshManVGH> WinKey+G or WinKey+i for game mode settings
[1:50:28] <%Dapper_Cactuar> I think Rebb has chat open on a second monitor if I remember right
[1:50:31] <+BigChiefBear> just learn2computer
[1:50:33] <Astrophizz> probably not game mode, that just makes borderless fullscreen as performance as exclusive fullscreen
[1:50:40] <Azathotic> For the love of god turn of Game Mode, its terrible
[1:50:49] <%BoxNavy> yes :)
[1:50:52] <%Rumbutt> We don't pay his sub1
[1:50:55] <%GIGA255> Did you bother getting any of the haste gear? I couldn't bring myself to get the augmented judge sets. such a time sink.
[1:50:55] <%X2Eliah> oh god windows 10 has a "game bar"? what the fuuuuu
[1:50:56] <tacotaskforce> It's so weird to see 14 without party member spell effects on. I'm so used to the entire screen being a ball of white half the time.
[1:50:57] <+Catpurnicus> the real tragedy of the Paige Lincoln stuff is she will never get to enjoy the trainwreck that is Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter
[1:51:03] <NitronStreams> you had the same problem with obs in admin mode so I dont think game mode would change anything
[1:51:04] <wibbwobbler> I blame ffxiv
[1:51:13] <%KineticZen> This took me weeks/months to nail down back when and I still don't remember how I solved it
[1:51:18] <$RealThiele> FF14 also likes to fuck with other software. game turns off all my logitech peripherals
[1:51:19] <%Maids4lyfe> boomer pat
[1:51:34] <+EdgeSetter> its better than regular twitch chat anyway
[1:51:39] <%X2Eliah> Oh that would suuuuck
[1:51:40] <ExpressNode> Fuck I have to clean the dust from my PC
[1:51:43] <AnnaBanana> I never had chat problems, I had frame problems. Ending up swapping second monitor from 60hz to 144hz to match my main monitor
[1:51:45] <%X2Eliah> especially with like a logitech mouse
[1:51:58] <%Rumbutt> @RealThiele Oh yeah, I noticed my kb & mouse going dark
[1:52:06] <AnnaBanana> Because windows is so bad about it
[1:52:11] <theinfamousq> you killed the cysty dongers congrats
[1:52:19] <%Maids4lyfe> maybe someone on staff hated logitech?
[1:52:23] <+BigChiefBear> japanese games and pc, name a more iconic duo
[1:52:45] <%Daxalog> Eeeeeeeeee
[1:52:45] <EvanDude47> that was the shadowbringers live letter
[1:52:48] <2DSuperiority> haha loud beep
[1:52:53] <%JoshManVGH> Found a Reddit user who had this issue 4 years ago and nobody answered them.
[1:52:55] <%KineticZen> Japanese software development
[1:53:01] <theinfamousq> which game was this?
[1:53:06] <%TheYellowcouch> all I can think about is theAli G bit of "Has computers made our lives better"
[1:53:11] <theinfamousq> or was it an ff14 stream
[1:53:12] <Daniel_Is_I> That was the FIRST live letter I watched
[1:53:14] <NitronStreams> awesome
[1:53:20] <+RoByte2> Problems in XIV only get fixed when they happen to YoshiP live.  That's why we got the RMT report button
[1:53:20] <nicegrandmafingers> what was the bug
[1:53:22] <%AlteisenReiseZ> HA HA, TIME FOR WARCRIMES
[1:53:34] <BigNerdSam> Yelling at Japanese game devs like DSP
[1:53:38] <Astrophizz> fun to find posts like that and then "NVM I figured it out" without explaining
[1:53:54] <orbulon> ive done castrum like 5 times and still dont understand it
[1:53:57] <%KineticZen> Oh yeah, it was related to Freesync
[1:53:59] <iosephe> holy shit
[1:54:00] <$RealThiele> some time later
[1:54:04] <%KineticZen> In my case
[1:54:12] <$AlteisenReiseZ> W H A L E
[1:54:16] <BigNerdSam> "THERE'S LITERALLY NOTHING I COULD DO WWOOOOWWWW"
[1:54:17] <+MayorRev> look at that whale!
[1:54:25] <$Afterman_> for years I was plagued with my PC randomly freezing forcing me to restart, I just found out about 4 months ago it was because I didnt have XMP on, so my PC didnt get ENOUGH voltage, lmao. I was pissed
[1:54:32] <%KineticZen> Breathtaker is speed/poison resist
[1:54:38] <%GIGA255> Deep essence of the bloodsucker is my favorite
[1:54:44] <%GIGA255> HP drain and attack buff
[1:54:48] <%NopeBadguy> YOU'RE SQUISHER THAN A DPS
[1:54:49] <+gutlesscoward> irregular's fun if you want to get one-shot as a tank
[1:54:51] <%NopeBadguy> WITH IRREGULAR
[1:55:02] <%AlteisenReiseZ> So chat, what's your favorite bozja combo? Mine's Watcher/Banner of Honed Acuity
[1:55:04] <NemokillerV> no it turns you into a glass cannon
[1:55:14] <%shurtal> gotta output extra dps
[1:55:18] <%NopeBadguy> Irregular's great because you do like way more damage than a DPS but you need to pop CDs for raidwides and not fail mechs or you just die outright
[1:55:19] <%NopeBadguy> IT's super fun
[1:55:22] <2DSuperiority> one raidwide and without cd you dead
[1:55:25] <%NopeBadguy> I've done Irregular in Castrum
[1:55:33] <%KineticZen> Easier bans if you're Hasan Kappa
[1:55:36] <aeonicvector> splits at the very least
[1:55:36] <iosephe> external client
[1:55:50] <%JoshManVGH> Pat, when did you last Update Chrome?
[1:55:54] <no123450n> external client
[1:55:57] <%X2Eliah> ... you can put RGB on it?
[1:56:09] <theinfamousq> chrome totally autoupdates what
[1:56:10] <%Vibe__Lord> for mods that don't watch the steam but still have to moderate
[1:56:14] <%X2Eliah> Chrome autoupdates by default on every launch/exit
[1:56:21] <%GIGA255> You could always hang your phone from the ceiling with chat in the screen.
[1:56:22] <Daniel_Is_I> Chrome doesn't autoupdate if you never close it
[1:56:22] <Astrophizz> it does, so long as you close it
[1:56:26] <%JoshManVGH> It can, but maybe the issue started when it last updated?
[1:56:27] <+EdgeSetter> more options you can go into to make the chat how you would like it
[1:56:30] <AsterKalix> IT should auto update unless you turn that off
[1:56:31] <%KineticZen> Yes Chrome does autopupdate and gives you a notification in the top right, but it's not related to this
[1:56:32] <%NopeBadguy> are you queued for castrum?
[1:56:48] <@StridentSong> Pat, can you answer Darius in FFXIV chat
[1:56:57] <$RealThiele> sounds ok
[1:56:58] <%strakillias> My chrome's updater broke and I found out it was 20 version behind.
[1:57:16] <+Cuon_Alpinus> rip that hrothgar
[1:57:39] <iosephe> You can filter messages with Chatterino, apparently
[1:57:41] <%TheYellowcouch> spinning 3headed cerberus
[1:57:53] <%KineticZen> Yeah and the passengers sit on each head
[1:57:58] <%valriot> Baby Lightning
[1:57:58] <%JoshManVGH> Another reddit from 4 years ago indicates that Chrome ver 58 broke the scrolling, but rolling back to 57 solved the issue.
[1:58:01] <TioXyco> and the other 3 people go on the heads
[1:58:08] <DanThePumpkinman> is that a fucking cerberus? ff14 is wild
[1:58:13] <%X2Eliah> ITS A BUS
[1:58:18] <%X2Eliah> ITS A LITERAL CAT BUS
[1:58:21] <+gutlesscoward> i don't like the cerb mount, it just looks weird to me
[1:58:23] <+Deosier> ahhh DR savage
[1:58:23] <+mikesapartment> dam patrick did da hard thing?
[1:58:27] <+Zonino> They're allowing you to go into Delebrum Reginae Savage with 24 people in the next patch, right?
[1:58:27] <BigNerdSam> PUPPERBUS
[1:58:31] <%NopeBadguy> it should fucking carry you in its mouth
[1:58:31] <AsterKalix> When did that mount come out?
[1:58:33] <JigsK> thats not even the weirdest mount, man
[1:58:35] <+mikesapartment> O
[1:58:40] <%GIGA255> The last castrum I did, there were two parties who insisted they would be lyon party. 2 wipes later...
[1:58:44] <%Vibe__Lord> ME :3
[1:58:45] <%JoshManVGH> I don't think you need to roll back that far, but a version might not hurt so long as it's not a major security patch.
[1:58:47] <%KineticZen> Velyndra gave me a lot of advice and encouragement getting into Delubrum Savage
[1:58:48] <DanThePumpkinman> me
[1:58:50] <%KineticZen> I was one of them
[1:58:52] <DanThePumpkinman> it was .e
[1:58:56] <%Vibe__Lord> All good :)
[1:58:57] <%BoxNavy> me :)
[1:58:57] <DanThePumpkinman> damn
[1:58:58] <$RealThiele> im definitely not
[1:58:58] <Daniel_Is_I> Pat doesn't do normal savages, there's no way he's gonna do DRS.
[1:58:58] <aeonicvector> I am not the guy who recomended chatarino but will take credit
[1:59:01] <+crazyspartan214> me
[1:59:02] <%KineticZen> Velyndra's the man

[1:59:09] <%Vibe__Lord> I AM THE ONE
[1:59:10] <%BoxNavy> yeah but me tho :)
[1:59:11] <iosephe> there can only be one
[1:59:11] <%blastazoid00> Not me
[1:59:13] <%vexion_smh> one guy saves the day
[1:59:14] <+crazyspartan214> no im spartacus
[1:59:16] <%Dapper_Cactuar> I hate it when you keep getting queued into mainly dead bozja instances
[1:59:17] <balthazar758> good guy and not one guy
[1:59:20] <+EdgeSetter> @PatStaresAt, have you run this tiers savage?
[1:59:21] <%Puhff> we all did it
[1:59:24] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> if chat is quantum it can be two
[1:59:25] <%JoshManVGH> All glory to the solution maker!
[1:59:27] <%Puhff> as a F A M I L Y

[2:00:11] <%JoshManVGH> So this is the bad duty?
[2:00:11] <%X2Eliah> idk what that means
[2:00:13] <%AzureGale> Become seme
[2:00:14] <AsterKalix> I've never seen top so this aught to be fun
[2:00:24] <@mothmandraws> bottom has harder mechanics it seems
[2:00:29] <@mothmandraws> ive seen bot wipe more
[2:00:30] <%SunnyVarietyPack> MAYBE?
[2:00:31] <%Vibe__Lord> Could also intergrate Frankerfaces
[2:00:36] <%Vibe__Lord> and BTTV
[2:00:44] <%X2Eliah> What what what
[2:00:46] <%TheYellowcouch> yeah it's for real big streamers!
[2:00:49] <NitronStreams> ???
[2:00:52] <%HitchhikingThrough> what's this thing called?
[2:00:55] <%ClericOfSparda> ???
[2:00:56] <Turtlepool> octoImpacto
[2:00:57] <2DSuperiority> Pat learns that Twitch is lacking some features
[2:01:00] <iosephe> catJAM
[2:01:01] <%JoshManVGH> Vibe__Lord improved Pat's job!
[2:01:05] <%Vibe__Lord> @HitchhikingThrough Chatterino
[2:01:11] <%X2Eliah> @HitchhikingThrough Catterino
[2:01:14] <+EdgeSetter> only thing it doesnt have is hype train and points betting stuff
[2:01:14] <%GummiBunnies> actual QOL updates for stream
[2:01:17] <@Moobot> I don't know if I can trust that. (@sajuk_khar) (warning)
[2:01:36] <%Puhff> good
[2:01:40] <@mothmandraws> points betting has been fun in my chat
[2:01:43] <$RealThiele> pat do points gambling? unlikely
[2:01:44] <@mothmandraws> let ppl bet on wipes
[2:01:45] <%X2Eliah> Not displaying hype trains seems like an upgrade tbh
[2:01:45] <%JoshManVGH> The crap is points betting?
[2:01:46] <sajuk_khar> Sorry. A random link must have snuck in
[2:01:48] <%blastazoid00> Does pat stream not have Frankerfaces? monkaS
[2:01:50] <Daniel_Is_I> Well hype trains and bets are stupid so good

[2:02:47] <NitronStreams> OUR coat
[2:02:49] <%blastazoid00> How good is the haste augment?
[2:03:01] <%Frost_Quill> I started using the bozjan fending coat because of you Pat, I didn't realize how great it looked when dyed.
[2:03:04] <Srthunda> tvs and monitors do not have memorable names
[2:03:09] <Nupinoop296> is that FF12 music or am i hearing things?
[2:03:13] <DanThePumpkinman> it was an LG wasn't it?
[2:03:14] <$RealThiele> OLED LG of some sort.
[2:03:19] <$OranHexthief> @sajuk_khar probably the LG CX
[2:03:21] <%KineticZen> LG pickup artist Kappa

[2:03:54] <sajuk_khar> Thanks Pat! You're the best!
[2:03:58] <tacotaskforce> I've stolen like half my glamours from people I've seen in roulettes
[2:03:58] <@mothmandraws> I hope we keep the big 48 man stuff for 6.0 onwards
[2:04:30] <%Rumbutt> You can't say "All" when you only have one glam Pat
[2:04:41] <@mothmandraws> people worry too mcuh about dps disparity in this, it doesnt matter that much
[2:04:50] <+mikesapartment> :|
[2:04:51] <$RealThiele> that is quite a large roboto
[2:04:52] <@mothmandraws> you can jsut death the iron giant
[2:04:54] <%valriot> God i hate Delirium, poor mans Inner Release, why Yoshi-P
[2:04:57] <%blastazoid00> Bottom always does a stupid amount of dps in my instances
[2:04:57] <Riorii> castrums have been super smooth for me lately
[2:05:00] <%X2Eliah> Oh, LG CX is a pretty expensive series
[2:05:02] <0078thunder> dont you have an entire 5 min for enrage when the group kills the other boss?
[2:05:12] <atsu333> MMm those glove glams
[2:05:12] <%Buzzard42> so what's left
[2:05:12] <%thedankestmeeme> SUGOY
[2:05:13] <%Rumbutt> So one glam oroLUL
[2:05:18] <Zebylth> bruh
[2:05:24] <%transporterthesequel> So one glam
[2:05:24] <+olive_js> I don't understand how Pat isn't stress being main-tank
[2:05:28] <+lord_woodsy> hey guys first time watching live so wanted to greet you all!
[2:05:31] <+Cuon_Alpinus> @0078thunder it's also a soft enrgae that can by bypassed by Lost Deathing the enrage add
[2:05:31] <%shurtal> gloves are like hand socks, they don't count
[2:05:40] <%the38bandit> The cx goes on sale a lot
[2:05:42] <%Rumbutt> Be honest, if you could have them all have the same look for the chest you totally would
[2:05:45] <+HankTheCapraLord> HankTheCapraLord subscribed with Prime. 
[2:05:45] <Jonami90> Oh what, this one has FFXII music?
[2:05:55] <balthazar758> @lord_woodsy sup
[2:05:55] <%transporterthesequel> Main Tank means if you die its everyone elses fault
[2:05:57] <@mothmandraws> ye this is an ff12 boss
[2:05:59] <Daniel_Is_I> Pat strikes me as the kind of guy who would buy 20 plain t-shirts in bulk if he could
[2:06:00] <%X2Eliah> @olive_js Yeah idk but it seems Pat likes tanking way more than being dps or healer
[2:06:02] <LoreKeeper_Thal> most of bozja stuff has FFXII music
[2:06:07] <%transporterthesequel> Even if its not
[2:06:08] <LoreKeeper_Thal> [bozja is like, right next to Dalmasca
[2:06:08] <@mothmandraws> wait not this ones type 0
[2:06:09] <%KineticZen> No waves for you
[2:06:11] <LoreKeeper_Thal> map wise
[2:06:13] <SunnyVarietyPack> @olive_js honestly its way less stressful than one would think
[2:06:14] <@mothmandraws> bozja is ff12 and type 0
[2:06:17] <%shurtal> Main tanking isn't bad once you get used to it, you just have to know what you need to do, and fuck everyone and everything else
[2:06:28] <Jonami90> Nice
[2:06:34] <%Rumbutt> This is one of the smoothest runs of this boss I've ever seen, very nice
[2:06:35] <$RealThiele> what a deal
[2:06:36] <@mothmandraws> I still super called reaper in that reddit thread, reaper fits the type 0 stuff in bozja
[2:06:37] <+mikesapartment> 14 black t shirts
[2:06:41] <JustYudha> I don't see the problem with that?
[2:06:42] <ExpressNode> What's bad about that?
[2:06:48] <tacotaskforce> take care of all your t-shirt business in one transaction. That's just efficiency
[2:06:49] <%GIGA255> Bulk tshirts don't come with catuars on them
[2:06:54] <%KineticZen> Same polarity always gets me
[2:06:54] <%GIGA255> cactuars
[2:06:58] <%ssjklyco> I went to school with someone who did. THey are a weird type of personaliity.
[2:07:00] <DanThePumpkinman> im that guy. once i find clothes i like i buy heaps of them
[2:07:03] <+olive_js> I dropped off of this game because I have no idea what to do now that I've hit 60.
[2:07:04] <%X2Eliah> 20 of the same shirt is more boring than 20 different shirts
[2:07:05] <+athuramn> @Jonami90 I've been thinking it but I couldn't be sure, this is ffxii music?
[2:07:05] <%thedankestmeeme> will you?
[2:07:08] <KennySD> How important is optimal play in this game if I'm not doing anything intense (such as savage etc?)
[2:07:09] <no123450n> fuck t shirts with text, everyone is always stopping you to read
[2:07:15] <+olive_js> And doing MSQ as a level 60 SCH is miserable.
[2:07:16] <@mothmandraws> not really kenny
[2:07:18] <%CalderGaming> love to see it
[2:07:23] <@mothmandraws> even savage doesnt require 100%
[2:07:30] <%shurtal> watch someone not save their hostage
[2:07:30] <+lord_woodsy> @balthazar758 thanks for the reply didnt know if anyone noticed my message, glad someone did, happy to say hello!
[2:07:36] <NeoseekerStitch> "Now that's what I call teamwork! - Gladio Noodles
[2:07:37] <@mothmandraws> savage needs like 80% optimisation
[2:07:41] <%X2Eliah> @KennySD Not very, as long as you don't get other ppl killed
[2:07:43] <aeonicvector> @KennySD you should learn it but its not backbreaking, plus it teaches you as you go
[2:07:43] <WroughtIronHero> God, Bozja is so fucking awful.
[2:07:48] <%GIGA255> So how many hostages are going to die this time, i wonder.
[2:07:52] <%thedankestmeeme> bro I'm stuck at work and I keep thinking of days gone its such a good game but so dumb but I like the motorcycle
[2:08:02] <KasGiD> What is Pat doing? I know its FF XIV but like what is it? an Alliance Raid or something?
[2:08:02] <%KineticZen> I bet 6/6 saved
[2:08:04] <theinfamousq> who makes castles this big
[2:08:08] <thetunnelhomer> I wish Bozja had more color. It's just so *brown*
[2:08:15] <%Daxalog> I dont think I want to be anywhere near a place called a "Castrum"
[2:08:19] <%X2Eliah> @theinfamousq rich ppl
[2:08:20] <orbulon> what does saving the hostages do?
[2:08:21] <%transporterthesequel> Savage is an 8 man waltz and sometimes people don‚Äôt know how to dance
[2:08:31] <Nupinoop296> Castrum Lactose
[2:08:35] <%X2Eliah> mmmm content
[2:08:43] <$RealThiele> Bozjan southern front is a level catcup and weapon skin grind
[2:08:51] <OverpricedTaco> @orbulon Extra baby chests after the next boss
[2:08:54] <%thedankestmeeme> 48 people is a mini raid?!?!?!?!
[2:09:04] <@SpaceCapnCrone> Fun fact: the guy we're fighting right now, Albeleo, uses the planned 1.0 Arcanist staff.
[2:09:05] <%GIGA255> Castrum is an old Roman word for fortress.
[2:09:07] <%X2Eliah> Castrum is just greek or roman for fortress, right?
[2:09:15] <KennySD> Yo thanks for the replies! I'm finding my way around my rotations and stuff, i juts don't want to get to a point where i can't keep up
[2:09:19] <+lord_woodsy> does pat still collab with woolie? sorry if that's a question I shouldnt have asked
[2:09:21] <Isord> yes
[2:09:23] <%transporterthesequel> Also shadows on E10s is the worst mechanic in the game.
[2:09:28] <thedankestmeeme> oh
[2:09:32] <afronooch> any guess on what raid series we'll have to grind?
[2:09:38] <@mothmandraws> trans have you turned your camera height up
[2:09:40] <T_Sasquatch> luckily i think most jof the jobs i main have shit relics so I dont need to do this shit LUL
[2:09:41] <@mothmandraws> its super easy then
[2:09:43] <%CzeekyTV> @transporterthesequel brambles in e9s are far far worse
[2:09:45] <%JoshManVGH> Are there adjustments coming for this step? Or did they already happen?
[2:09:53] <%X2Eliah> @lord_woodsy Oh yeah, he does (not much for game LPs but yes for podcasts), woolie just got back pain
[2:09:58] <%Divryne> Dataminers will have it out by tonight.
[2:10:03] <%Frost_Quill> We've already seen them, right?  We saw them in the Bozja story.
[2:10:07] <%SunnyVarietyPack> you mjust past it
[2:10:09] <+mikesapartment> shift up arrow on keyboard is all i know
[2:10:16] <%Tenkay> You just scrolled past it
[2:10:17] <%BubbaRands> Hi Pat
[2:10:18] <thetunnelhomer> I hope the last relic step will use the Artifact weapons.
[2:10:19] <%Tenkay> 3rd person camera something
[2:10:20] <%Notsoevilz> Notsoevilz subscribed with Prime. 
[2:10:21] <%BoxNavy> after you make the laws order relic do you get the purchase a replica of the glowy resistance relic?
[2:10:27] <thetunnelhomer> Shadowbringer is too cool to not glow
[2:10:29] <%BoxNavy> to purchase*
[2:10:31] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt 2nd to last step tends to be the worst step so that will be fun
[2:10:32] <%BinaryFireball> hey pat you ever do the pvps in ffxiv? is it worth while?
[2:10:33] <+EdgeSetter> controll settings I think
[2:10:33] <%Zundelle> I hope the paladin one looks better than the current step because boy I think it's a downgrade from the first model
[2:10:34] <%GIGA255> I'm gonna go ahead and get the GNB relic, but I'm getting rid of it as soon as we get a dyebale version of the Dwarven Gunblade. It's the absolute chunkiest.
[2:10:47] <+lord_woodsy> @x2eliah thank you wasnt sure so had to ask, love the bromance they have!
[2:11:03] <@mothmandraws> cant remember wher eit is
[2:11:07] <%Tenkay> Character Config > General > all the way at bottom
[2:11:08] <@mothmandraws> its more a practical thing
[2:11:08] <%X2Eliah> @lord_woodsy Yeah it's very lewd sexy

[2:11:10] <%Notsoevilz> good luck with the grind, been doing ninja myself
[2:11:16] <KasGiD> Huh. This is the first time I have ever heard about it. I did only just finish Shadowbringers recently. Thank you Pat.
[2:11:24] <0078thunder> the current DRG relic looks so awful compared to the one before
[2:11:27] <%thedankestmeeme> have you and that darius dude been through a lotta raids? is he a dark knight too?
[2:11:51] <%KineticZen> LAlafell vision
[2:11:52] <+lord_woodsy> @x2eliah agreed! they way all good friendships should be!
[2:11:54] <%Tenkay> Put it at max
[2:11:56] <%BoxNavy> WutFace
[2:12:02] <@mothmandraws> you want to be low on screen
[2:12:02] <%KineticZen> 6/6 sure enough
[2:12:04] <%Frost_Quill> Mine is set at 28 for some reason.
[2:12:05] <%Puhff> DansGame
[2:12:05] <Daniel_Is_I> Low angle shots
[2:12:05] <+EdgeSetter> I keep mine at like 50 I think
[2:12:08] <%GIGA255> I have my camera angle set to 60
[2:12:09] <%JoshManVGH> TOO CENTERED!
[2:12:10] <Sunstalker> kinamaMad GO EVEN WORSE
[2:12:13] <%X2Eliah> Pat ofc it's EW you put it at 0
[2:12:17] <%transporterthesequel> @czeekytv so yes, but I had to tank E10S so I had to learn shadows the normal way AND BACKWARDS
[2:12:23] <%X2Eliah> Bottom
[2:12:24] <%BoxNavy> lalafells have it all the way up
[2:12:24] <KasGiD> omg 100 looks so bad
[2:12:26] <%Frost_Quill> Lalafell camera angle.
[2:12:27] <%X2Eliah> Bottom center
[2:12:31] <clockworkidiot> you're the cross bar now
[2:12:31] <%weissguard> No, it's not EW, it's ShB
[2:12:31] <%JoshManVGH> Under your cross bar
[2:12:32] <tacotaskforce> I'm still curious how useful the augmented boz gear is. Is the haste worth that time investment?
[2:12:32] <%SunnyVarietyPack> 100 is wayyyy too high
[2:12:35] <DianaTheAscian> LUL LUL LUL
[2:12:44] <%LailahQueenx> LOL
[2:12:49] <CzeekyTV> @transporterthesequel same here, brambles are still worse haha
[2:12:49] <%X2Eliah> So it's literally how far up from your head the pivot point is
[2:12:57] <NitronStreams> ah yes under the hotbar exactly where you want your character
[2:13:18] <Guardiansaiyan> No wonder they are using Zdiac Age music...look like Galataian building design
[2:13:24] <%KineticZen> Default has some trouble with taller bosses unless you pan up
[2:13:25] <afronooch> lewd
[2:13:29] <%Rumbutt> @tacotaskforce it is for BLM, since the stats you get from the Bozja synch are terrible
[2:13:29] <%BoxNavy> sure
[2:13:30] <Vyskus> I have mine at like, 60/70 usually
[2:13:32] <CircleofSpines> butt lines
[2:13:33] <+CookieCutter007> genius

[2:13:36] <rcand9> PAT  likes when its in his but?
[2:13:37] <+silentblast93> when do the belts go away pat
[2:13:39] <%Daxalog> *Writes note* likes...in...butt.. uh huh.
[2:13:42] <%GIGA255> bar
[2:13:42] <%Puhff> Confirmed: Pat Boivin likes it in the butt
[2:13:45] <@mothmandraws> pat you gonna have extra slots for DR
[2:13:48] <@mothmandraws> i need to run it
[2:13:53] <%JoshManVGH> Slappen dem cheeks on da hot bar huh?
[2:13:55] <%X2Eliah> @rcand9 you don't? o_O
[2:14:05] <%transporterthesequel> @czeekytv for some reason my static was great at brambles. I have no idea why.
[2:14:10] <%Frost_Quill> I keep names off and it's so much better.
[2:14:11] <%NopeBadguy> i have a button near my movement keys that turns off nameplates so i can easily id people and turn them off for mechs at will
[2:14:13] <Nupinoop296> it really does. i turned off names in raids ages ago just so i could see anything
[2:14:13] <Sunstalker> Mothman on stream kinamaPog
[2:14:15] <@Velyndra> @mothmandraws you need to pay the fee 500 raw amber to me
[2:14:17] <%Daxalog> They should allow you to make everyone else in the instance invisible
[2:14:20] <%SirGO0SE> everyone likes when its in butt :)
[2:14:24] <%GIGA255> I hate that there is no option to turn names OFF during combat. Only an option to turn ON during combat.
[2:14:26] <%vexion_smh> keep it clean is nice
[2:14:34] <%Rumbutt> I like to at least have my party member names on so I can identify them, especially in content like this
[2:14:35] <rcand9> @X2Eliah i mean sure but i dont tell 1000 people Kappa
[2:14:38] <tacotaskforce> @Rumbutt Ah, that makes sense, but also, I'd die before playing BLM in here.
[2:14:41] <CircleofSpines> omg a guard scorpion lol
[2:15:02] <%BoxNavy> i keep names on for that reason i love the clusterfuck
[2:15:03] <%CzeekyTV> @transporterthesequel They're fine when everyone is on the same page. Aether PF's obsession with 10 variations of happy brambles makes pugging e9s awful lol
[2:15:04] <%BoxNavy> its funny
[2:15:11] <%TheYellowcouch> it meeee

[2:29:31] <2Bs_USB_port> when will he be "back"
[2:29:32] <%MidnightBurst12> spines are notorious bitches
[2:29:33] <Berendenn> The Banes got him
[2:29:34] <+snausages_> Deluburum savage seems so cool but where am i going to get a static fo 48 ppl Sadge
[2:29:36] <%GIGA255> the whole lyon encounter is like 5 moves, too. it's so frustrating when you have a party insisting they're going to take Lyon and then immediately botch it.
[2:29:38] <%W1nterTitan> Like Paige level?
[2:29:39] <%asgard147> Poor Woolie, I hope he's okay limesFeels
[2:29:40] <+atteroproxy> @rei0 He broke his back, his back is broken
[2:29:40] <%ssjklyco> On a scale of 1-Paige, how bad?
[2:29:44] <+DinnerCalzone> I'm only Resistance Rank 9, does Castrum require that much coordination?
[2:29:45] <StrangeCoincidence> The most unbreakable back has been broken
[2:29:46] <+Cuon_Alpinus> @mothmandraws its just a straight line from jump point a to b. just line up with his leap and strafe to the side
[2:29:47] <Nupinoop296> oh no
[2:29:56] <+SeventhVice> It‚Äôs because of the constant back downs woolie performs
[2:30:02] <%SirGO0SE> Reggie's Star Craft strats were *that* good
[2:30:12] <$RealThiele> hes a big guy so likely a herniation or stenosis hope hes doin ok
[2:30:19] <@mothmandraws> it snapshots on jump i feel
[2:30:19] <+ShitLord> how come they dont draw the asshole on the bosses
[2:30:22] <$Ziegsy> My youtube has been reccomending me pet chiropractor videos. theres one where a dog gets its back cracked and it so damn happy he does the whole body wiggle
[2:30:22] <%KineticZen> How do people not get Lyon below 70, just no essences or damage actions at all?
[2:30:23] <+RalvrWuff> How are babies doing? Especially Gief
[2:30:44] <+DazzlingFuhrer> especially ELMO
[2:30:58] <%GIGA255> The griffin us always pointing in the direction he's facing when he lands,
[2:31:25] <+Cuon_Alpinus> knockback cancel NUT
[2:31:26] <+atteroproxy> There's a lot happening here
[2:31:26] <rcand9> is this what a top means?
[2:31:29] <%KineticZen> Even in pub groups we usually skip the marching AOEs, that's sad
[2:31:31] <Azathotic> Pat having the enemy HP bar uptop with ALL THE BUFFS while his hotbar and health is on the bottom is triggering the hell out of me
[2:31:34] <Rei_Dsoto> I hate Dawon's jump sequence.  Always difficult to judge the angle of his Cross attack
[2:31:36] <DianaTheAscian> I've never actually seen lyon so this will be fun
[2:31:45] <+Catpurnicus> I want to see woolie play more dead genres, maybe he can do guitar hero next time
[2:31:46] <%transporterthesequel> You can get DISTURBINGLY far in FFXIV knowing nothing
[2:31:47] <@mothmandraws> exoflares the hardest mechanic
[2:32:13] <%GIGA255> arms length for that second pushback

[2:32:52] <AsterKalix> I have seen people with multiple max level classes not understand basic mechs

[2:33:37] <%BestTeaMaker> LUL
[2:33:37] <+snausages_> prob is that the game doesn't really teach DPS exclusive players very well imo, while tanks and healers do a lot of carrying. Then these ppl try savage and are still expecting a carry when they are the carry

[2:48:06] <%Deft_Thought> But I'm making a schedule to limit my playtime and not get crazy
[2:48:08] <%transporterthesequel> @pylohn he was disastrously wrong about a Tsukyomi mechanic that caused half the player base to follow it blindly, killing that STORY INSTANCE for weekes
[2:48:09] <%Daxalog> Is that the Harry Potter theme?
[2:48:12] <NitronStreams> @deft_thought you mean the FF14  free trial up to level 60 including the award winning expansion Heavensward?

[2:48:59] <Zebylth> time for math
[2:49:01] <%CalderGaming> @Pylohn his Thing is putting out day-one guides to new content, so they're not necessarily optimized or the most straightforward, but a bunch of players use them anyway instead of thinking for themselves or waiting for a better guide

[2:50:30] <nicegrandmafingers> tsukuyomi ex has a mechanic where 3 meteors must be dropped in specific places

[2:51:00] <%solracc25> Now @PatStaresAt  is the top FF14 streamer.
[2:51:00] <%QueequegTheater> Learn2Code Kappa
[2:51:05] <Srthunda> you are given so much time to math
[2:51:06] <%Puhff> QUIK MATHS
[2:51:17] <balthazar758> 2+2
[2:51:21] <LoreKeeper_Thal> MANS NOT HOT
[2:51:23] <+Nau2calNonsense> Holy shit. Haven't seen pat since SBF breakup.   Does Woolie have ankylosing spondylitis? That shit SUCKS
[2:51:25] <T_Sasquatch> thats wayy more time than the original fight LUL
[2:51:47] <%QueequegTheater> You're no Woolie Kappa
[2:51:50] <samuraicaveman> cause Woolie is
[2:51:51] <%solracc25> Highschool math in "real" life
[2:51:51] <%TONYOO101> obviously woolie's the top ffxiv streamer
[2:51:52] <%TheYellowcouch> I like them Pat
[2:51:52] <%Puhff> you are in my heart <3
[2:51:53] <nilla_24> i like

[2:51:56] <Riorii> woolie is
[2:51:57] <%TheYellowcouch> I'm in htem now
[2:51:59] <NitronStreams> WORLD PREMIER
[2:52:07] <luishGO> whats wrong with the ingame audio?
[2:52:08] <aeonicvector> Nah its cause you dont do solo Bluemage stuff =P
[2:52:09] <inksmears> woolie being the number one ff14 streamer that one day was hilarious LUL
[2:52:10] <skyentombment> are we all babies, chat?
[2:52:13] <+axenred> I like your ff14 stream pat. sometimes.
[2:52:20] <skyentombment> if so , let's all say wehhhh
[2:52:28] <%Puhff> they might!
[2:52:29] <%vexion_smh> LUL
[2:52:30] <+Nau2calNonsense> I like myself sometimes
[2:52:43] <%asgard147> but you good Pat limesSip
[2:52:45] <ExpressNode> Its nice to watch but I don't understand anything about this game honestly
[2:52:45] <aeonicvector> i promise ill keep your EW streams on in the background while I EW
[2:52:47] <+pastaforte> i've never played ff14 but this stream is cool to see!
[2:52:56] <Vyskus> imho most ffxiv streams are boring as hell, at least pat is entertaining
[2:52:56] <+Horosho> HOW DO BLACK MAGES PLAY THIS FIGHT
[2:52:56] <+snausages_> Pat do you ever play healer
[2:52:57] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt You should do more guide streams, you explaining why rotations are important on the podcast increased my DRG DPS by like 40%
[2:53:00] <Nintail> But the only math I can do is for parsing.
[2:53:08] <Surprise_Anole> It's your fault I've got 2000 hours in this game since your shadowbringers streams
[2:53:11] <%asgard147> "Yes" psaDogchamp
[2:53:14] <$Ziegsy> Scathe
[2:53:14] <Fiendmaw> I would love to see you play through EW MSQ Pat,please do it
[2:53:14] <$RealThiele> this is just shit they stole from Ivalice
[2:53:15] <TootPirate> I enjoy your ffxiv streams, I think my favorite stream of yours ever was the new player's guide- probably because I was just getting into ffxiv lol
[2:53:16] <+Nau2calNonsense> I feel like any math Pat does always ends up with "get a DPS boost"
[2:53:16] <+Saunt> Scathe spam
[2:53:17] <aeonicvector> @Horosho casters suffer, or the do the tiny circle strafe
[2:53:19] <+DinnerCalzone> *crying in black mage*
[2:53:19] <%TheYellowcouch> I really can't do this fight for the life of me
[2:53:25] <%QueequegTheater> "No leylines for you, bitch"
[2:53:28] <%Deft_Thought> Is it better to have friends to jump into this with or is the solo experience all right for new players?
[2:53:31] <PanicSwytch> I main Black mage
[2:53:32] <$Ziegsy> same as whm, dia spam
[2:53:32] <+atteroproxy> My friend hates Bozja but he's also a BLM main
[2:53:33] <%asgard147> limesFeels
[2:53:33] <+snausages_> With Black mage there is like 90 percent of the playerbase that doesnt get the class, then 10 percent that are really fucking good at it and destroy everyone elses logs
[2:53:37] <%Dapper_Cactuar> Pat is one of the few streamers I see on Primal, most seem to be on Crystal followed by Aether if they aren't on the EU or JP servers
[2:53:39] <%solracc25> Mages can't do math
[2:53:40] <%GIGA255> It's funny you say that because the garleans literally stole this shit from ivalice, lol
[2:53:42] <%Zundelle> nah that's white mage
[2:53:45] <Zebroneath> Black Mages needs more things like Triple Cast
[2:53:45] <+Cuon_Alpinus> pat I would like to introduce you to bards
[2:53:46] <Vyskus> higher than drg?
[2:53:47] <Qsmash_> is Black Mage harder to play or something?
[2:53:48] <+snausages_> black mage is legit the best designed class in the game
[2:53:48] <+ZipperHands> I'm a rare breed of BLM that does his work
[2:53:49] <aeonicvector> just pixel perfect dodge tho
[2:53:51] <$RealThiele> but muh leylines
[2:53:54] <PanicSwytch> I LOVE MY LINES
[2:54:00] <Forester_Skippy> just use Scathe lol
[2:54:01] <$Ziegsy> Shenpai is crystal so
[2:54:02] <inksmears> yeah a lot of them are on crystal
[2:54:06] <+Saunt> Crystal the RP hell server
[2:54:06] <+JenovaS> I play Black mage and it has so much movement now in shadowbringers
[2:54:07] <@mothmandraws> there are some primal streamers
[2:54:14] <inksmears> primal has NEST at least?
[2:54:15] <DianaTheAscian> a lot are on crystal
[2:54:16] <%Wallabri> Wallabri subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 35 months! thanks for getting me into FFXIV, pat. i started after seeing you be hype in a ShB live letter stream, now i'm omni-80 cause this game completely rules
[2:54:21] <T_Sasquatch> @Qsmash_ basically they have to stand still to do their best damage, the uiisue is theres a ton of shit to dodge ingame
[2:54:22] <+Edrem> it depends on time of day, the JP streamers come alive in like 10 hours
[2:54:22] <+Cuon_Alpinus> @snausages_ BLM is up there but RDM da bes
[2:54:24] <%asgard147> limesS monkaS
[2:54:27] <+snausages_> You can slide cast in your ley lines like its a bullet hell, or use xenoglossy to weave atherial manipulation to a party member which is some fcuking Vergil feeling shit
[2:54:27] <2Bs_USB_port> this will be terrible for the economy
[2:54:28] <%QueequegTheater> BALMUNG WILL ESCAPE CONTAINMENT
[2:54:30] <%Deft_Thought> Soon we will all become as one
[2:54:33] <AsterKalix> I can't wait for that day
[2:54:33] <Shadowshinji> Shit. Guys. As a BLM? Fucking walk out your laylines. You can warp back after the big death.
[2:54:35] <PanicSwytch> I honestly fine Black mage fun
[2:54:36] <%Buttface_> soon they'll ALL be RP servers
[2:54:39] <2Bs_USB_port> OH GOD BALMUNG
[2:54:40] <%Evil_Emu147> What Data Center does Mizteq play on?  I thought she was Primal too.
[2:54:41] <+Nau2calNonsense> Loathsome Memory: "Matt and Pat are no longer friends"
[2:54:41] <%Rumbutt> Cross Data Center Hunt Trains
[2:54:43] <%CzeekyTV> DF and PF aren't going to be cross-Data Center right?
[2:54:43] <tacotaskforce> My favorite black mage I ever saw was in Aurum Vale, who only cast ice spells, because he wanted to keep his MP high "in case he needed it". He was so cool.
[2:54:46] <+Saunt> wont be able to trade though
[2:54:46] <inksmears> we should keep balmung locked tho
[2:54:46] <%CalderGaming> aether here. dunno any streamers but we have Zucchini Loaf which is better
[2:54:46] <%QueequegTheater> @Deft_Thought you can absolutely play it solo and just use Duty Finder for trials
[2:54:47] <%KineticZen> As someone on Mateus, we're worse
[2:54:49] <TootPirate> I didn't know Crystal was the RP hell until I was in Shadowbringers starHorror
[2:54:51] <DianaTheAscian> eh
[2:54:52] <%LaughingCatt> The economy is already terrible everywhere
[2:54:54] <Daniel_Is_I> I doubt they'll let you use the  market board on another server
[2:54:58] <Srthunda> will they even allow people to buy and sell cross data center?
[2:54:59] <Surprise_Anole> Soon Pat will be a Balmung
[2:55:02] <%solracc25> Won't the game die from the overload of servers
[2:55:06] <karovus> would it be worth the trip to balmung though
[2:55:06] <+Edrem> no way they'll allow marketboard, JP is like half price compared to NA
[2:55:11] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> One world one market
[2:55:11] <NeonBleu> New Job: Middleman
[2:55:14] <+Figleafplays> but everyones gonna do that though
[2:55:17] <%Dapper_Cactuar> most people expect marketboard to be locked to players visiting other datacenter
[2:55:18] <T_Sasquatch> 7 gil PogChamp
[2:55:18] <$RealThiele> or some hyper-gillionaire controls the whole market
[2:55:18] <Warbot40> I just chose Crystal Zalera cause friends were on it. No idea about the reputation of each server.
[2:55:20] <Qsmash_> @T_Sasquatch oh, gotcha
[2:55:22] <%GIGA255> 6 gets you gold.
[2:55:24] <%asgard147> Is that bot that undercuts everyone still around?
[2:55:25] <Nintail> We'll be set back to when we would buy iron ore from NPCs to sell no the market board.
[2:55:29] <+Nau2calNonsense> If you can't sell across then defacto you can't buy across right?
[2:55:32] <+FingaLights> Stupid Globalists. Think about the Economy
[2:55:33] <%Dregon_Azure> but if you go to balmung, you might be scarred
[2:55:33] <$Ziegsy> they said yes to buy because it had little impact when they did it cross server
[2:55:34] <%KineticZen> FFXIV: Day Trader edition
[2:55:39] <%Dunsparcetheglare> do i have to type in /tell or /reply when someone messages me or am i a dummy
[2:55:44] <inksmears> honestly i dread and fear the data center cross stuff but what can you do LUL
[2:55:48] <%QueequegTheater> Invest YSH
[2:55:50] <%solracc25> Choco bitcoins
[2:55:57] <%QueequegTheater> Lyon is super easy tho
[2:56:02] <%QueequegTheater> Just dodge
[2:56:10] <%CalderGaming> @Nau2calNonsense you can buy but not sell on other servers within your datacenter right now
[2:56:18] <%TheYellowcouch> lmao
[2:56:18] <+Tetherline> 4Head
[2:56:20] <%QueequegTheater> Just remember
[2:56:21] <%TheYellowcouch> just do combo
[2:56:25] <%CalderGaming> "JUST DODGe"
[2:56:26] <%CzeekyTV> Aether raiders gong to JP data centers are in for a rude awakening
[2:56:27] <%BoxNavy> 4Head
[2:56:30] <%asgard147> SourPls
[2:56:30] <Daniel_Is_I> Just don't get hit
[2:56:30] <luishGO> hey pat you have the same audio distortion on the in game audio as the fanfest on twitch some times
[2:56:33] <iosephe> just do it
[2:56:35] <NeonBleu> no but dodge tho
[2:56:37] <+Tetherline> Just dodge bro 4Head
[2:56:37] <%Buttface_> just don't get hit idiot????
[2:56:38] <%KineticZen> Just remember the precise radians of the second cascading AOE 4Head
[2:56:43] <NitronStreams> Just do it perfect the first time tho
[2:56:44] <%Dakuu75> I just hit Lv.62 on Samurai but, I'm still on MSQ level 50. (I think because I'm doing ALLLLLLL the side-quests)
[2:57:03] <%KineticZen> Just remember to sheathe when you see Extreme Caution come on
[2:57:07] <%KineticZen> The second one gets a lot of people
[2:57:09] <%GIGA255> Don't you get like 99 lockboxes from winning the duel?
[2:57:10] <+Tetherline> If you try to fight gabriel you need to be a tank or have the invuln item
[2:57:12] <+Edrem> Dynamic Sensory Jammer is super heavily based on ping, not in your favour though
[2:57:15] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt I think I have a brain thing, to be fair.  I've aced every math test I've ever taken without studying, but apparently math is hard for non-crazy people
[2:57:16] <%LaughingCatt> Its easier said then done
[2:57:17] <StaticEntry> dont get hit pat
[2:57:17] <+aphotophilic> have you tried getting good? thats what I ask my raid members
[2:57:27] <+snausages_> i always just blind run content like this tbh, I dont care if we wipe lol
[2:57:34] <Daniel_Is_I> This is the easiest of all the duels so yeah, not too tough
[2:57:34] <%solracc25> Oh scorpion FF7
[2:57:36] <Klefth> Oh, god, it's Mehja...
[2:57:39] <%asgard147> limesFeels
[2:57:44] <+magnum_howl> DSJ can be cheesed using Lost Swift
[2:57:45] <+Shillk> pat has the best streamer luck
[2:57:45] <%GIGA255> crazy talk, activate
[2:57:52] <%transporterthesequel> Just be good
[2:57:55] <NeonBleu> Let us ridicule you
[2:57:56] <Daniel_Is_I> Pat trying to proc crazy talk
[2:57:59] <%Deft_Thought> @QueequegTheater Word, thank you
[2:58:06] <StaticEntry> is the scorpion model in FFXIV just the model in 7 remake?
[2:58:07] <balthazar758> never ever
[2:58:08] <AsterKalix> I like learning the mechs on my own and experiencing them so I run blind all the time
[2:58:08] <%KineticZen> Honestly tempted to just bring Beast to Lyon/Sart duels since the healing gets dicey with Skirmisher
[2:58:11] <%A_Mighty_Walrus> attack when it's tail is up
[2:58:14] <%transporterthesequel> I got the duel the first time I ever did this fight and I panicked and ran away like a bitch
[2:58:33] <%Dakuu75> lol
[2:58:38] <+Edrem> at 2 notoriety you seem to get it every single time
[2:58:39] <%CalderGaming> great name
[2:58:41] <%KineticZen> Hey Jason Statham plays FFXIV
[2:58:41] <%Tetherline> Tetherline subscribed with Prime. 
[2:58:45] <Daniel_Is_I> They should have just made it so if someone failed, another person got to try it until it died or there was nobody left
[2:58:49] <%QueequegTheater> @Deft_Thought the actual raid tiers are EX and Savage content, but you can get Party Finder groups for those
[2:58:52] <DianaTheAscian> thats a great name
[2:58:53] <%asgard147> psaDogchamp psaDogchamp "FOOD?!"
[2:58:56] <%Puhff> wow rude pat
[2:58:59] <+aphotophilic> is his mount an audi?
[2:59:00] <%transporterthesequel> Yes, yes it is.
[2:59:03] <+GIGA255> I almost won the Gabriel duel, but I accidentally clicked my left stick and went into first person mode, panicking imediately and dying
[2:59:10] <%GIGA255> right stick*
[2:59:11] <+aphotophilic> nice
[2:59:17] <penitentpendant> I wish they would allow qualifying for the duel as credit towards Notoriety. So you don't 'waste' it on a duel you don't want.
[2:59:19] <%solracc25> psaBig psaDogchamp psaCrazyhead psaCrazyhand
[2:59:23] <%transporterthesequel> WHAT it is weird.
[2:59:27] <%CzeekyTV> @GIGA255 sounds like it's time to rebind that to literally anything other than first person lol
[2:59:37] <RocketBarrel> Your right stick isn't a sprint macro? @giga255
[2:59:48] <%QueequegTheater> Do the whole game in 1st person view to be a real chad
[2:59:49] <RocketBarrel> what are you doin m8?
[2:59:50] <%GIGA255> my left stick is a sprint macro
[2:59:50] <%Deft_Thought> @QueequegTheater Are Party Finder groups as varied in quality as I imagine?
[2:59:51] <%solracc25> look at that bar go down
[2:59:59] <RocketBarrel> Ah
[3:00:22] <Saltmeisterr> oh shit
[3:00:28] <Saltmeisterr> its the ff7 boss
[3:00:29] <%Deft_Thought> I had some bad experiences in FFXI
[3:00:34] <%KineticZen> Tail Missile got me all the time since I ended up fenced on the wrong side of the arena by the bits
[3:00:37] <%KineticZen> Not anymore
[3:00:38] <%Dakuu75> OMG WTF are you suppose to do when the WHOLE damn floor is orange XD
[3:00:43] <%QueequegTheater> @Deft_Thought you can mark your PF group as "Loot" "Practice" or "Duty Completion", but there are still definitely some not great players
[3:00:44] <Slim_Lipid> have they ever made a boss where the discoball aoe HUD things make a penis attack
[3:00:47] <%Valdorick> Talk shit get hit
[3:00:50] <%CalderGaming> pat you took ages to figure out the cross pattern on dawon
[3:01:13] <%Deft_Thought> @QueequegTheater To be fair, I say this as a new player who'll be shit like every newbie
[3:01:15] <%GIGA255> fingers crossed
[3:01:15] <%transporterthesequel> People get overwhelmed by the circles not knowing they go off in like, a year
[3:01:20] <%emperordread> Hey chat, how's giefers? psaGiefrail
[3:01:38] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt The latency on the Dawon Obey attack is literally 5 seconds for me
[3:01:46] <$RealThiele> d-d-d-d
[3:01:50] <2Bs_USB_port> already ???
[3:01:50] <%KineticZen> Duel will wrap before Castrum starts

[3:03:08] <tanarath> Imagine that Gief's FRIEN is walking outside.

[3:05:59] <%CalderGaming> wait where did the duel go
[3:06:00] <%weissguard> I imagine there's now a part of the grass that looks like a fire hose went off on it.
[3:06:07] <%BoxNavy> da pps
[3:06:09] <%GIGA255> How long have you had Gief now?
[3:06:12] <+MarlooRedd> no one compliments me when I do a good peepee
[3:06:18] <%Daxalog> You ever accidentally eat on of the dog treats. Haha. Imagine.?
[3:06:24] <%CalderGaming> did he quit out in favor of castrum?

[3:07:09] <%BoxNavy> im so embarrassed for you
[3:07:09] <Fefe41> Pat you got me to try the free trial and now I'm sorta hooked. Thanks I hate you
[3:07:10] <%TheYellowcouch> big embarace
[3:07:12] <%alloVera> @CalderGaming he wasn't chosen
[3:07:13] <%TheYellowcouch> pockets too full
[3:07:15] <%BoxNavy> my god
[3:07:18] <%transporterthesequel> Geif sounds like a soundboard for generic big dog noises.
[3:07:18] <+Cuon_Alpinus> better do two runs of crystal tower to make it a nice round 5 Kappa
[3:07:29] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Any idea what the PS5 changes will be
[3:07:29] <%Teyaric> So, what IS all this Bozja stuff for? I heard the word Artifact at some point, but you never know what that means.
[3:07:45] <%CalderGaming> @Dakuu75 it'll only be for sale at the end-of-HW town
[3:07:46] <%QueequegTheater> @Teyaric relic weapons
[3:07:54] <%QueequegTheater> Big glowy shiny weapons
[3:07:55] <%GIGA255> how much bozja gear do you have left to augment?
[3:08:04] <aeonicvector> @Teyaric super shiny "way more then you need" weapons
[3:08:11] <aeonicvector> stuff that will be relevant for half of EW
[3:08:17] <%Puhff> LUL
[3:08:19] <%weissguard> LUL
[3:08:21] <+Cuon_Alpinus> @Teyaric it's also the dedicated leveling content for 71-80 since ShB didn't have a deep dungeon like PotD or HoH
[3:08:21] <%Zundelle> look at how cool moff is
[3:08:21] <%Valdorick> That's the LAMEST of kids!
[3:08:22] <%BoxNavy> get outta here mothman
[3:08:23] <%Mendin> Relic weapons, relic armor (good but not top tier but boosts more bozja playtime), and some mounts and cosmetics
[3:08:27] <%VioletHeart> That's Moth alright.

[3:09:05] <AsterKalix> artifacts are the "best in slot" items
[3:09:07] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Pat I'm currently on the Hyperconductive step (umbrite+sand), how many steps left until Cronus Lux

[3:09:24] <%BoxNavy> WutFace
[3:09:25] <%Deft_Thought> monkaS
[3:09:35] <Fefe41> Is he wearing the cone of shame?
[3:09:36] <%Zundelle> I'm not even going to pretend that they'll make a cooler relic for AST than the anima weapon so I ain't even investing in that
[3:09:37] <%GIGA255> Did he even realize he had them to begin with? They weren't just lost in the folds?
[3:09:39] <DianaTheAscian> god
[3:09:39] <%ssjklyco> it taint a thing anymore
[3:09:45] <%Mendin> Zangief is truly impervious to damage, even z-targetted ball strikes
[3:09:45] <rangriz> Jesus christ
[3:09:48] <NitronStreams> i hate this
[3:09:49] <%BoxNavy> he seems not as rambunctious
[3:09:49] <Mothman_TV> I'm coming over from WoW and hit 30 recently. I've seen a lot that the story is super important, and I've skipped pretty much everything to this point. How fucked am I as far as following the story now?
[3:09:51] <%LaughingCatt> i didnt want to know that
[3:09:51] <%Daxalog> Like icecream
[3:09:54] <+MTLxSpider> r u winning
[3:09:55] <%QueequegTheater> >going top Kappa
[3:09:55] <%Evil_Emu147> Spaying is still gnarly :(
[3:09:59] <Ipsenscastle> you saying that is making my balls hurt, please stop
[3:10:02] <DianaTheAscian> so he has a empty bag now?
[3:10:03] <+snausages_> wow sounds very satisfying to scoop them out
[3:10:03] <%Dregon_Azure> i didn't need to know this
[3:10:04] <%Puhff> @ssjklyco BOOOOO
[3:10:04] <%KuroStardust> "No balls, huh? Must have lost 'em in the war"
[3:10:09] <%BoxNavy> ohhh
[3:10:13] <%MaxeusTheFirst> What if the replaced the balls with clackers so they would clack as he walked around.
[3:10:14] <%QueequegTheater> Spaying is much rougher than the male equivalent
[3:10:17] <%Mendin> Hey look 2/3rds of everyone is heading topside, standard Castrum run Kappa
[3:10:19] <tacotaskforce> My old roomate's dog had his balls out and just sat on the floor crying and moping for hours... but then his cone came off and that was actually the only thing he was upset about.
[3:10:19] <LoreKeeper_Thal> @Mothman_TV you might've missed a few important concepts to the story
[3:10:21] <%CzeekyTV> @QueequegTheater You have not too much longer to go. The next "longest" part is light farming I think, which you can do in like an hour and a half with a PF party in A9S
[3:10:23] <%BoxNavy> his balls organ
[3:10:26] <+natjen8> @Mothman_TV you're fine man, just play how ya want
[3:10:33] <AXL808> fatter?!
[3:10:36] <%CalderGaming> EVEN FATTER?
[3:10:42] <%QueequegTheater> @czeekytv >A9S
[3:10:42] <+DocSigma> ...is that possible?

[3:11:08] <%A_Mighty_Walrus> @QueequegTheater same step as me I think it's another four to go
[3:11:08] <%QueequegTheater> I know
[3:11:11] <+HelloImTom08> its always hard to tell the groups casue of phasing
[3:11:17] <%QueequegTheater> I am sad because I'm not going to do that
[3:11:18] <+MarlooRedd> I could have gone at least one more day without hearing how dogs are neutered
[3:11:20] <+fetrigon> cut his food just like you cut his balls smh FeelsWeirdMan
[3:11:24] <rangriz> YUCK
[3:11:25] <%BoxNavy> haha

[3:11:29] <%GIGA255> castration revenegance
[3:11:29] <+MTLxSpider> Lmao
[3:11:31] <%Puhff> i would rather not
[3:11:36] <LoreKeeper_Thal> i sees it
[3:11:36] <%Mendin> Hilariously the worst part of CLL is this fight due to the weird party subdivide and then the synchroniczation slapfight

[3:11:40] <%ssjklyco> His ball juice has moved to his burger juices
[3:11:40] <Warbot40> @PatStaresAt He's not able to lick his incision is he? We've tragically lost a dog to an infection in the past and while it was a lot of bad luck, it probably started because they got at their incision once or twice.
[3:11:46] <Copperage> you asked for it LUL
[3:11:48] <blackblackffxiv> My sister has a 200 lbs mastif and he does drive by slimes on peoples hands lol
[3:12:00] <balthazar758> zangief skill
[3:12:03] <+KawaiiJetty> "sorry guys, there is slime all over my hand"
[3:12:04] <%CzeekyTV> @QueequegTheater it'll take a lot longer yo do the light farm solo and you don't actually do any mechanics, just smack the boss. But up to you
[3:12:23] <derekwst3> thats what she said
[3:12:25] <%MaxeusTheFirst> Babby too chonkers?

[3:13:02] <%Daxalog> Do you scratch his ears for him? Since he cant reach past the cone.
[3:13:03] <%Mendin> Elmo is gonna taunt Gief by schlorping his bag
[3:13:04] <%Deft_Thought> Oh, this track is from FFXII, isn't it
[3:13:09] <%Mendin> "Look I can reach  miiiiiiiiiine"

[3:13:14] <%CalderGaming> @Warbot40 pat talked earlier in the stream about how gief's physical dimensions render him unable to reach the incision in any way
[3:13:28] <$Ziegsy> Nah this track is from star wars
[3:13:33] <%CalderGaming> @Fefe41 sure is
[3:13:36] <LoreKeeper_Thal> yes this is the Esper boss theme from FFXII

[3:14:45] <Warbot40> @CalderGaming Well that's good. We just had our new dog recover from their spay a month ago and I was a nervous wreck the whole time. Went bad last time.
[3:14:48] <%BoxNavy> what a good guy
[3:14:50] <NeonBleu> That's what he's gonna do
[3:14:52] <%QueequegTheater> Isn't DRK much better as an OT due to TBN
[3:14:56] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[3:14:58] <DanThePumpkinman> is ff15 good? im downloading it for the first time

[3:15:20] <%Puhff> KILL LAMP
[3:15:25] <%ssjklyco> He's mad cause the lamp has more balls now
[3:15:25] <%GIGA255> the machine gun debuff barely does anything to you.
[3:15:34] <%BoxNavy> is the lamp new?
[3:15:37] <Qsmash_> I liked 15 but I don't honestly know if I'd call it good.
[3:15:45] <jimmytwofeet> It's a Boivin!
[3:15:48] <%Deft_Thought> KILL
[3:15:48] <Fefe41> @danthepumpkinman it's decent if you like open world, then it railroads after a certain point
[3:15:48] <%QueequegTheater> Yeah I though PLD and WAR were your giant meatshields and GNB and DRK were the OTs
[3:15:50] <+SuperCoolieoGuy> Regret

[3:16:18] <Saltmeisterr> KILL WIFE
[3:16:24] <%BoxNavy> kill wife. kill wife good.
[3:16:28] <AsterKalix> @DanThePumpkinman It depends on what you want out of the game, as a FF game no it is not good, as  a game to fuck around and road trip with the bros yes it's great
[3:16:28] <Qsmash_> also I hear the Royal edition is better so hopefully you're playing that version
[3:16:34] <%QueequegTheater> Bruh just survive the enrage phase Kappa
[3:16:44] <DanThePumpkinman> @fefe41 cool, thanks. it's my first ff lol
[3:16:44] <plaguedoctor_syan> Man Woolie must be angry less than a minute video explain what he took 4 to 5 to make
[3:16:58] <%solracc25> good heals
[3:17:11] <plaguedoctor_syan> of course i am just joking
[3:17:19] <sightlesspoem> which one on the screen is Cloud?
[3:17:25] <+natjen8> man I do love Bozja and Castrum. I hope they make more content like this
[3:17:31] <Nupinoop296> i had to look that up because i wanted to know what you meant and that was pretty funny
[3:17:34] <%Dakuu75> how many enemies need to be on the board for you guys to start using AOE and not single-target Weaponskills
[3:17:35] <DanThePumpkinman> yeah I'm playing the royal edition
[3:17:35] <plaguedoctor_syan> at max the video is a sol bad guy story only
[3:17:37] <%GIGA255> Do you think Sage might do for healers what Gunbreaker did for tanks? Like an actual DPS rotation that rewards you with better heals/barriers for its execution.
[3:17:39] <%KineticZen> TOMORROW!
[3:17:46] <KrentistTheDentist> tomorrow yay
[3:17:52] <+ALazo> dammit

[3:17:54] <%BoxNavy> oh shit
[3:17:55] <%Puhff> :O
[3:17:58] <aeonicvector> i think he means a new act
[3:18:09] <%Dakuu75> "sad snore"?
[3:18:09] <%Deft_Thought> Now why is the free trial asking me for a Registration Code? ü§î
[3:18:11] <thetunnelhomer> I need Zadnor to not be brown.
[3:18:16] <KrentistTheDentist> curious about the new relic steps too
[3:18:19] <Warbot40> We had a soft cone which I think was our biggest mistake. Swapped to a hard cone and had multiple anti-biotics but nothing worked. May have been too slow by the time the infection started. This time we started with the hard cone of shame. Went fine thankfully. @CalderGaming
[3:18:22] <%Raiden_Breaker> hoverbike
[3:18:26] <%QueequegTheater> @thetunnelhomer O_O
[3:18:26] <%CzeekyTV> @GIGA255 I wouldn't be surprised. GNB and DNC feel awesome within their role, I assume we'll see a continuation of that for Sage and Reaper
[3:18:27] <%Puhff> wow that's a lot of dudes
[3:18:28] <%Dapper_Cactuar> well there will be a new 2 person mount
[3:18:32] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt is it a new map?
[3:18:34] <+KawaiiJetty> I just want to listen the new battle music in Zadnor
[3:18:34] <aeonicvector> 10-15, 15-20, 20-25, and prob same exp but the better gear and new options
[3:18:35] <T_Sasquatch> Ive completely ignored bozja and any of that eureka shit LUL
[3:18:36] <TioXyco> but zadnor is confirmed to be 71 access? I think delubrum wasn't, or was it?
[3:18:45] <Fefe41> Lmao
[3:18:46] <%Deft_Thought> He too THICC
[3:18:51] <sightlesspoem> FAT NECK
[3:18:53] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Bulldogs are hard counters to cone
[3:18:57] <Rei_Dsoto> Go Pat Go!  take them down
[3:18:57] <Fefe41> Burger too big
[3:18:59] <%Deft_Thought> More neck than dog
[3:19:00] <Wolfstriker121> thicc neck
[3:19:02] <%LaughingCatt> might add in weekly challenge log bonuses for both zones, it worked for Eureka
[3:19:02] <PanicSwytch> HE IS TOO STRONG

[3:19:09] <AXL808> what about using a toilet seat?
[3:19:09] <%solracc25> Too big for cone
[3:19:10] <%weissguard> Zangief's neck is dummy thicc, and the sound of his burgers keeps alerting the Pat
[3:19:19] <%BoxNavy> monkaS

[3:19:31] <%Puhff> lol do that again
[3:19:35] <%Dakuu75> he has a built-in cone. god just gave up on this dog
[3:19:37] <%GIGA255> Just put Gief in a fluffy dress.
[3:19:37] <%Mendin> Zangief doesn't -have- a neck, his body and head are just one continuous oblong rectangle of meat
[3:19:47] <%vivaldiva> built in dog donut
[3:19:49] <%BoxNavy> saved by fat
[3:19:50] <%Mendin> He's one of those square cow paintings
[3:19:57] <%Puhff> god knew his balls would not last
[3:19:58] <%QueequegTheater> Bulldogs are the tank mains of the canine family
[3:20:13] <Explodincatz> need a cone harness
[3:20:17] <%solracc25> Punished Gief psaDogchamp
[3:20:19] <%Mendin> ...Has Nobody Ever Painted Gief In The Big Square Livestock Style? The "I'm feeding my son/give me the loops" style?
[3:20:21] <Warbot40> Good dog dad.

[3:22:24] <+Brannax> I hope they make DR give 5 timeworn relics next patch as well.. I doubt it, but I hope
[3:22:27] <thetunnelhomer> As long as you don't wipe in Castrum
[3:22:27] <%Dakuu75> Gief of the hidden balls village
[3:22:28] <%LaughingCatt> & you wont hate yourself as much
[3:22:28] <%BestTeaMaker> what happened to max's stream?
[3:22:32] <thetunnelhomer> Which is likely on Crystal
[3:22:33] <CruxAustralis> fuck
[3:22:41] <tacotaskforce> but think about all the time you can get mad at people for not standing on the button in circus tower.
[3:22:43] <%QueequegTheater> I fucking hate timeworn
[3:22:44] <CruxAustralis> I thought that sound was my queue popping
[3:22:50] <NeonBleu> so this is the rest of my day now
[3:22:51] <%psydaku> this ... isn't this ff12 music?
[3:22:52] <%KuroStardust> Those all BLU runs of Syrcus Tower at the start of the patch were pretty fun and fast tho
[3:22:57] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> Oh, so you DON'T have to do Savage Delebrum for the last step?
[3:23:00] <%CzeekyTV> POTD is much faster
[3:23:02] <plaguedoctor_syan> she was even talking about how she can¬¥t be child friendly because of swaring and screming balls in my ass like Cartman in the dead by daylight stream
[3:23:04] <%GIGA255> I need to farm labyrinth of the ancients. i need an onion belt for nostalgia purposes.
[3:23:11] <%Zundelle> deth
[3:23:14] <%strakillias> Hey Pat, does your CPAP track events per hour? I took a nap Saturday and hit a new record with 66 events in the hour I was asleep.
[3:23:14] <%QueequegTheater> @czeekytv not for me
[3:23:19] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt would you do it again?
[3:23:22] <+UberWolfman> @BestTeaMaker Some asshat was DOX'd a MKX Player's IP during the twitch Rival event hes hosting
[3:23:35] <%JoshManVGH> holy shit, POTD is that damn long?
[3:23:42] <oedocontroller> god i would hate this game so much. The run speed looks so slow
[3:23:57] <%CzeekyTV> @QueequegTheater my DR runs were constantly 1+ hours :(
[3:23:59] <%BestTeaMaker> @BestTeaMaker jesus, that's terrible
[3:24:01] <%QueequegTheater> DR takes 40 minutes PotD takes 15 per 10 floors and my drop rate for 51-100 is less than 10%
[3:24:03] <@Velyndra> its 20-30 mins each, more after 151
[3:24:18] <tacotaskforce> took my party 4 hours to get from 50-150, and after 150 shit gets real.
[3:24:19] <%shurtal> and rooms with like 11 mimics
[3:24:24] <%CzeekyTV> POTD above floor 100* is faster
[3:24:28] <T_Sasquatch> eh
[3:24:31] <@Velyndra> 51-100 is ~15-20% each, 101-150 is ~75%, and 151+ is 100
[3:24:43] <%Dakuu75> @PatStaresAt have you ever farmed low-level gear just because you thought it looked cool, for glamour?
[3:24:43] <%QueequegTheater> DR takes like 45-50 for me TBH
[3:24:45] <+Sargonyx> Do you have to be rank 10 to get into Reginae?
[3:24:49] <%TheYellowcouch> press button Pat
[3:24:52] <@Velyndra> @Sargonyx yes
[3:24:54] <Rei_Dsoto> I mean, I got the Law's order Manatrigger, and I'm LOVING it.
[3:24:58] <afronooch> I average 30-40
[3:24:58] <%QueequegTheater> @Sargonyx yes
[3:25:03] <2Bs_USB_port> DELUBRUM >>>>>>> CASTRUM
[3:25:04] <%BestTeaMaker> I think DR's fun, but it sucks when people doing it suck
[3:25:09] <Flakari> DR is fun
[3:25:11] <%QueequegTheater> Wait why
[3:25:14] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt the music is good at least
[3:25:18] <+Cuon_Alpinus> Go pet one of the Liondads in the other parties
[3:25:20] <rei0> i like DR
[3:25:20] <2Bs_USB_port> is fun :)
[3:25:21] <%psydaku> any way to speed up anima weapon grind?
[3:25:22] <+Sargonyx> @Velyndra ty!~
[3:25:25] <%KuroStardust> it's alright
[3:25:26] <%BestTeaMaker> DR is also much easier
[3:25:26] <afronooch> DR is great if everyone uses lost actions
[3:25:26] <%CzeekyTV> I'm tired of seeing tanks go in with the Irregular essence then staying on the floor the whole time
[3:25:27] <Felto3> DR is great, its just too long
[3:25:28] <%lemuhollow> DR is my favourite part of Bojzna
[3:25:29] <%Zundelle> it's my favorite content in bozja :)
[3:25:29] <%VioletHeart> What's the problem with Delubrum?
[3:25:33] <+Kurochiooo> DR when the deeps is too low X_X
[3:25:33] <$Ziegsy> I did all my DR in about 2 days. I FUCKING cant remeber a thing I Blcked out the WHOLE THING
[3:25:35] <%GIGA255> I'm really annoyed that the new haste gear is locked behind DR Savage. i was excited to go nuts with GNB's haste-buffed rotation
[3:25:40] <+Jenalicious> not a fan of normal, really like savage though
[3:25:41] <+Basilias_Maximus> At least you can queue up for it normally.
[3:25:43] <%Aeogard> I just had a failed Castrum, we wiped with 3mins left at 0.1% on the orb boss. :')) @PatStaresAt
[3:25:43] <%Kaask> delubrum sucks
[3:25:43] <%VioletHeart> Yeah DR's great.
[3:25:44] <afronooch> but when its slow, good lord i long for death
[3:25:45] <DianaTheAscian> no
[3:25:47] <Daniel_Is_I> DR was fun at first but it got old FAST
[3:25:50] <@mothmandraws> its great you just have to run it too much
[3:25:51] <%QueequegTheater> DR is great, Crazy Talk is afoot
[3:25:51] <%NopeBadguy> Join Delubrum Normal speedruns or get a party for POTD
[3:25:51] <tacotaskforce> man, now I'm curious why you'd be mad about DR. DR has fun mechanics
[3:25:52] <+ALazo> At least I can do it on my time instead of struggling to get in castrum
[3:25:55] <%NopeBadguy> For Timeworn grind
[3:25:57] <%VioletHeart> It's a bit jank as a weird pseudo-alliance raid but I like it.
[3:26:00] <iosephe> It's my least hated part of Bozja
[3:26:00] <%KuroStardust> You can have some BAD runs of DR
[3:26:05] <T_Sasquatch> i was getting atmas for the arr relic and i may have legit lost sanity permanently
[3:26:07] <%CalderGaming> yup
[3:26:09] <%Dapper_Cactuar> Delubrum's boss music besides the music in it's last boss fight kinda sucks. BWOM BWOM
[3:26:09] <tacotaskforce> OK, that's fair.
[3:26:13] <%CalderGaming> sloooow
[3:26:13] <rei0> true
[3:26:15] <AsterKalix> and if people fuck it it takes long
[3:26:18] <takkarwestmarch> Think about wife. KILL WIFE. Sad. Wife fight back? KILL WIFE.
[3:26:20] <afronooch> 100% fair
[3:26:22] <$Ziegsy> DR Savage was hell
[3:26:25] <%Valdorick> Just go in premade psaSmug
[3:26:26] <ColRedyx> Well that's a problem with the other players.
[3:26:34] <AsterKalix> I like it and it has neat mechs, but man does it take a while
[3:26:36] <Daniel_Is_I> I did it as DPS WHM because that is one button and I could mindlessly do it
[3:26:39] <%BestTeaMaker> that's fair, I haven't had a too terrible run myself yet
[3:26:43] <%QueequegTheater> Sounds like Primal players suck ass, I have had no issues on Crystal psaSmug
[3:26:49] <DianaTheAscian> I just do the weekly DR
[3:27:00] <+KawaiiJetty> I honestly can only do DR once a day, it just takes forever. Only completed 2 relics oof...
[3:27:00] <%NopeBadguy> just make seven bots Kappa
[3:27:01] <Reap14> I think he means the content is fine its just the players that bring the content down
[3:27:05] <%Agami23> theres one boss in DB that feels like its HP has an extra 0 on the end, i swear to god
[3:27:05] <%Divryne> Go to all the players in the instance and hold them at gunpoint to use lost actions.
[3:27:06] <%Aeogard> @QueequegTheater You joke but I've had some insane 30min speedruns of DR today on crystal
[3:27:08] <crunchum> I personally just bumrush Palace of the Dead and pray for RNG
[3:27:09] <%Mendin> I hate DR as a healer because healing damage good means less when OOPS TWO MECHANICS WRONG == INSTANT DOOM
[3:27:10] <+Zadoulo> Cooperation in my team-party based game?!?
[3:27:12] <%GIGA255> If you want an easier time in DR, there's a discord for everyone on primal that runs, Baldesion Arsenal/Delubrum Reginae
[3:27:14] <DianaTheAscian> keeps the crazy from setting in
[3:27:18] <+SuperCoolieoGuy> @QueequegTheater I don't believe that for a second
[3:27:21] <Ralfclogs> I hate when there‚Äôs no healers and you have to ask for some
[3:27:23] <takkarwestmarch> Honestly just running crystal 15 times took me like literally 15 minutes a session and I got it a lot on my daily queue. Felt easier.
[3:27:35] <Surprise_Anole> I haven't even started the DR relic step yet, really hoping the rewards get better with 5.55
[3:27:41] <AsterKalix> back to back DR is really rough, weekly is fun
[3:27:42] <ColRedyx> TBF, people are terrible at everything in this game.  LUL
[3:27:46] <%Daxalog> oh man its 6 30 already
[3:27:51] <Zebylth> castrum is far worse for me for the same reasons dr is for you
[3:27:52] <%NopeBadguy> sleep apnea mask has become slime apnea mask
[3:27:53] <%BestTeaMaker> My only slow DR run was because I had a party of 7 healers XD
[3:27:53] <ColRedyx> But yeah, grinding out anything sucks.
[3:27:57] <+Cuon_Alpinus> no Fire+earth, we in the clear chat
[3:28:15] <%BoxNavy> was that a sneeze? :)
[3:28:17] <%QueequegTheater> Fire+Earth is such fucking bullshit
[3:28:20] <+SuperCoolieoGuy> imagine staying on crystal
[3:28:32] <+Jenalicious> normal gets a lot more interesting when there aren't any tanks
[3:28:35] <%BestTeaMaker> oh wow a good bioware game
[3:28:37] <LordDudeTheFirst> Doing DR 15 times gave me PTSD. I can't do it anymore
[3:28:39] <%Agami23> there was one dancer i played with who appeared in like every DB i did and they died at least 4 times every run
[3:28:41] <%NopeBadguy> more like Ass Effect
[3:28:43] <blackblackffxiv> RIP Miranda's ass
[3:28:44] <+DocSigma> Fire+Earth is grotesquely unfair
[3:28:48] <%Valdorick> Yeah, EA and Bioware magic ruined it
[3:28:50] <Warbot40> It's great until it's not
[3:28:51] <Ipsenscastle> Mass Effect fucking rules
[3:28:55] <CountMeowingtonn> mass effect 2 is one of my favorites of all time
[3:29:09] <Ipsenscastle> The first game has some of the best moments of any game story ever
[3:29:10] <+megaman_sentinel> yes that is very true
[3:29:13] <Wolfstriker121> hands down me 2 was the best overall
[3:29:16] <oedocontroller> does it actually end?
[3:29:18] <$QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Does Legendary include the story DLC that EA locked behind paywalls
[3:29:19] <Ipsenscastle> and a lot of tedium, granted
[3:29:21] <%thbluewarden> did they fix the ending?
[3:29:28] <%NopeBadguy> mass effect fucking ruled until publisher meddling fucking killed it @PatStaresAt
[3:29:36] <%CalderGaming> JRPG huh Kappa
[3:29:40] <Revzero25> Never really got into mass effect, only cared about Dragon Age
[3:29:44] <CountMeowingtonn> There is a spot in hell waiting for those who dont hug Tali
[3:29:46] <%Buttface_> that same line is in New Vegas
[3:29:46] <+MayorRev> "I WAS!"
[3:29:51] <%Agami23> the sonic comics totally took that line because its too good.
[3:29:57] <%Rumbutt> Pat talks about people not knowing how to play their class in this game all the time and sure enough, just saw the ninja in here using hellfrog on this single target encounter
[3:30:00] <ToneBacas> Garrus used tackle. It's super-effective
[3:30:01] <%the38bandit> mass effect 3 still has my favorite dlc of all time
[3:30:02] <%BestTeaMaker> my problem with mass effect 2 is that you get tali later than I wanted
[3:30:03] <%QueequegTheater> Even if you don't romance her you need to hug Tali
[3:30:10] <penitentpendant> Tali is the hottest Anime Waifu
[3:30:22] <Ipsenscastle> @Agami23 that line has existed in multiple things for a long, long time
[3:30:26] <thetunnelhomer> Tali simps are terrifying.
[3:30:29] <afronooch> yeah
[3:30:30] <iosephe> yeah
[3:30:39] <Chimeraelite> LUL
[3:30:43] <%BestTeaMaker> LUL
[3:30:43] <T_Sasquatch> FUCK THE GETH
[3:30:45] <takkarwestmarch> In a game with all those alien chicks somehow the human was still the best Miranda let‚Äôs go
[3:30:45] <%GIGA255> What about Wakka?
[3:30:46] <%Valdorick> She's a teenager who read one of THOSE sites.
[3:30:48] <T_Sasquatch> Destroy them all
[3:30:51] <%CalderGaming> they get more into that in 3
[3:30:51] <Chimeraelite> that's rough
[3:30:57] <Sunstalker> Same with garrus punisher takes
[3:30:58] <tanarath> THEY ARE IT'S GREAT
[3:31:00] <%Xelhesia> yup
[3:31:07] <%Valdorick> They literally just wanted to protect their creators!
[3:31:08] <%BestTeaMaker> she's much better about it in 3
[3:31:08] <CountMeowingtonn> "does this unit have a soul?" ;-;
[3:31:14] <%the38bandit> Legion is great
[3:31:19] <%Lion_kun> It's such a boringly one dimensional conflict compared to the Krogan dilemma
[3:31:21] <+MayorRev> I'm unfamiliar with Mass Effect, is space racism a common theme?
[3:31:23] <%thbluewarden> they're our robots!!!!
[3:31:25] <thetunnelhomer> I still am not sure if I wanna play Mass Effect OG or pay for the Legendary upgrade.
[3:31:30] <T_Sasquatch> Genoicide robots, I fully support it :)
[3:31:30] <%Lion_kun> it's one of the things I hate so much about ME3
[3:31:33] <%JoshManVGH> "AND!?"
[3:31:37] <thetunnelhomer> @MayorRev More in the first game than the second.
[3:31:37] <%QueequegTheater> Doesn't her loyalty mission in 2 literally have her faced with proof that she's wrong
[3:31:38] <%BestTeaMaker> mass effect is synonymous with space racism
[3:31:41] <%strakillias> Reminder Pat didn't play 3
[3:31:42] <%thbluewarden> i can kill my robot if i want
[3:31:48] <$PhantomMiG> @mayorrev the answer is yes
[3:31:48] <oedocontroller> it works for in-lore. Geths aren't really very open about their feelings, only changing it in ME3 after best boi legion goes buddy-buddy with shep
[3:31:49] <Cybersoul666> aren't geth like. a main antagonist?
[3:31:50] <%NopeBadguy> Please tell me you're going to Renegade on stream, everyone and their mother is going Paragon
[3:31:50] <%Valdorick> "Legion is straight up saying that the Geth have been CARE TAKING the planet for your return" "YEAH! FUCK THE GETH, WE SHOULD RETURN, WITH GUNS"
[3:31:50] <Sunstalker> careful talkking about stuff 3 in chat, Pat's never played it. kinamaList
[3:31:54] <An_Armed_Bear> oh god is this castrum
[3:31:55] <CountMeowingtonn> @MayorRev there are like 3 or 4 attempted genocides that we know about lmao
[3:31:56] <AXL808> funny they were cleaning the planet too after the left
[3:31:56] <T_Sasquatch> There is no level of sentience where I will ever support robots above people
[3:31:57] <%psydaku> It will literally let you agree with Ashley before it lets you agree with Tali. @patstaresat
[3:32:00] <BakedBam> World of warcraft looks great
[3:32:01] <+megaman_sentinel> they're robots they have no souls LOL
[3:32:08] <DanThePumpkinman> weird question, can you be gay in ME? I've never played it
[3:32:10] <$KnivesEve> shes hot though so morally gray
[3:32:15] <%Agami23> should i play mass effect? i remember hating it as a kid because people compared it to dragon age and i hate dragon age.
[3:32:17] <%NopeBadguy> Please tell me you're going to Renegade on stream, everyone and their mother is going Paragon.
[3:32:22] <%Teyaric> "There was a hole here. My hero worship has filled it."
[3:32:25] <T_Sasquatch> @DanThePumpkinman big gay
[3:32:25] <meteor530> Damn New world looks awesome. Who knew Amazon would give us such a great game.
[3:32:28] <afronooch> @DanThePumpkinman yeah, in 3
[3:32:29] <%Valdorick> Robot Rights are Sentient Rights!
[3:32:33] <thetunnelhomer> @DanThePumpkinman More of a thing in the third game in for males.
[3:32:35] <%BestTeaMaker> but yeah, Tali does learn how wrong she is at least
[3:32:40] <karovus> the geth were made to be a slave race and somehow the quarians still act like theyre the only victims in the situation
[3:32:45] <%AzureGale> As long as you punch the reporter in the face
[3:32:47] <%Lion_kun> Paige should play Paragon and you should play Renegade
[3:32:48] <oedocontroller> what's really weird is that in the entire whatever years between Tali's world being taken and ME2, there was no legion cases happening
[3:32:49] <Ralfclogs> You going Leon? Kappa
[3:32:50] <%GIGA255> i heard rave reviews about dragon age origins and absolutely despised it.
[3:32:50] <Fefe41> Be Vegeta and go renegade for life
[3:32:51] <An_Armed_Bear> Renegade gets more and more just... Mean as it goes
[3:32:53] <%QueequegTheater> Do it coward
[3:32:53] <afronooch> god mordin rules
[3:32:57] <%Cjjb1995> Never understood the love for the story of the Mass Effect trilogy, everything it does well is done better by Dragon Age Origins, and Dragon Age Origins had a great ending where your choices MATTERED
[3:32:58] <DanThePumpkinman> only 3? damn. i wanna be the big gay in all of em
[3:32:58] <GameOver_Here> It's really hard to get a good ending in 3 if you play Renegade.
[3:33:01] <+Basilias_Maximus> Renegade ends up being xenophobic as fuck.
[3:33:03] <%strakillias> Just be Pat Shepard
[3:33:06] <%Rumbutt> I like to go Paragon but hit pretty much every Renegade interrupt
[3:33:06] <thetunnelhomer> Mordin is the best.
[3:33:08] <%psydaku> renegade sucks in me3
[3:33:11] <meteor530> Music pretty legit
[3:33:14] <%Valdorick> I hope they changed punching the reporter to be karma neutral.
[3:33:18] <Fefe41> These tracks make me wanna play XII again
[3:33:20] <Sunstalker> Cjjb1995 It's because hot aliens
[3:33:20] <bellmorgu> i hate renegade in 3
[3:33:22] <+megaman_sentinel> you could always go Karen renegade
[3:33:23] <CountMeowingtonn> "somebody else may have gotten it wrong" ;-;
[3:33:24] <%Valdorick> paragon has better choices.
[3:33:28] <%LanceCorpralScottBukake> @patstaresat Did Woolie slip a disc? Is he doin okay? Are you?
[3:33:28] <%QueequegTheater> Because they're cowards
[3:33:28] <%rkbinder> Do Paragon-age
[3:33:29] <tanarath> Pat, if there was a mod that let you shit on the Quarians for being assholes in 3,would you install it?
[3:33:30] <%transporterthesequel> @patstaresat if you have never played ME3 you HAVE TO MONETIZE IT. ITS THE LAW
[3:33:30] <%the38bandit> mass effect 3 is worth it just for Citadel
[3:33:41] <%Valdorick> Renegade is less "Renegade" and more "LETS MAKE BAD IDEAS FOR NO REASON"
[3:33:43] <%Ynkubus_> I go paragon but a couple renegade choices are fun
[3:33:45] <Sunstalker> Go Renegade for options against assholes
[3:33:46] <CountMeowingtonn> alpha bitch renegade shepard though
[3:33:47] <An_Armed_Bear> There are some great Renegade prompts
[3:33:47] <%Cjjb1995> @Sunstalker at least that's an honest answer
[3:33:50] <%Garthunox> but you dont have to go all in on either side
[3:33:53] <An_Armed_Bear> But going full Renegade isn't fun
[3:33:54] <Vyskus> didn't 2 and 3 make it so that you could do both and they count towards exp?
[3:33:58] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> That sucks.
[3:33:58] <+ThomasOfTroy> paragon for major choice, renegade for minor ones
[3:34:00] <%Ynkubus_> yeah! window push!
[3:34:01] <karovus> many renegade options feel like being a dick just for the sake of being a dick
[3:34:01] <afronooch> non-important choices are better for renegade, but actual choices paragon is almost always better
[3:34:03] <T_Sasquatch> I was basically 70% paragon 30% renegade
[3:34:03] <%CalderGaming> punching the reporter
[3:34:07] <Warbot40> Paragon isn't fun because it's also a lot of space racism towards your crew. I don't like being a dick to my crew.
[3:34:13] <%Garthunox> like i will always do certain things, regardless of paragon or renegade
[3:34:13] <Warbot40> renegade*
[3:34:13] <CountMeowingtonn> you get evil glowy eyes in me2 if you go full renegade lol
[3:34:15] <meteor530> Paragon is for cowards
[3:34:16] <%JoshManVGH> Shooting the fuel tank when that dude is monologing.
[3:34:20] <An_Armed_Bear> It's way better to call her out than punch her
[3:34:27] <+NoWayRyanTatum> "You've been workin too hard" *tazes some random mechanic*
[3:34:31] <%QueequegTheater> I'm usually about 80% renegade 20% paragon
[3:34:43] <$PhantomMiG> @patstaresat Previous file means you will max out one side more a less at the start
[3:34:44] <+ALazo> I dunno. Disingenuous assertions punch is pretty great
[3:34:44] <Sunstalker> Cjjb1995 Also, mass effect can mask itself as a shooter kinda where as Dragon Age is always gonna come off as an rpg which can turn of a big crowd of people
[3:34:44] <%Valdorick> The problem is the game punishes you for going renegade on minor options, because you don't get enough paragon poitns to make the major choices.
[3:34:49] <%AzureGale> Yeah but "I've had enough of your disengenuous assertions!"
[3:34:50] <%Agami23> well thats alot of corpses
[3:34:53] <+MayorRev> I'm a reporter for "BATTLE TITS"
[3:34:55] <%QueequegTheater> Man, the latency on those Obey attacks is so fucking wild
[3:34:58] <thetunnelhomer> Paragon with a sprinkle of renegade is the way to go
[3:34:59] <T_Sasquatch> honestly i never got the anger at the reporter , she didnt say anything to me that I felt was unfair
[3:35:07] <Fefe41> Pick one of these things or fuck off
[3:35:10] <xDartuzax> Fear the nice guy that gets angry
[3:35:19] <CountMeowingtonn> reporters are evil
[3:35:21] <Blank9> full renegade to be insane
[3:35:27] <Vyskus> yeah.......
[3:35:28] <zer0enixx> LEFT HOOK
[3:35:30] <Sunstalker> Oh yeah, Pat. Starting 3 with a savefile of 2, lets you basically earn a second class's aqbilities
[3:35:32] <thetunnelhomer> James who?
[3:35:38] <%Lion_kun> I hate how nothing in ME3 matters. None of your choices mattered.
[3:35:40] <zer0enixx> paragon till death
[3:35:43] <oedocontroller> "i am commandor sheppard and this is my favourite shop on the citadel" as you go by 20 shops
[3:35:44] <%cvp5127> go away ashley
[3:35:45] <%AzureGale> Yeah well that's the consequence of being a bad commander
[3:35:47] <%BoxNavy> wow fuck that
[3:35:51] <afronooch> Jacob went back to his home planet
[3:35:53] <+atteroproxy> Don't fuck up
[3:35:54] <Hoodywolf> what
[3:35:54] <%Cjjb1995> @Sunstalker true, but that's why I specifically mentioned the writing initially
[3:35:55] <%QueequegTheater> You can survive 2 with only like Morinth and Legion then kill them both in 3
[3:35:56] <%JoshManVGH> Riot.
[3:35:58] <%shadowsofpain> but the Javik
[3:35:58] <Blank9> just be the krogan in ME3, be a vanguard and turn it into a weird melee game
[3:35:59] <T_Sasquatch> me3 is depressing
[3:36:03] <Hoodywolf> what did I walk into?
[3:36:04] <%Xelhesia> hoodbye wrex :(
[3:36:07] <+megaman_sentinel> that doesn't even make sense not to have one
[3:36:08] <%AzureGale> Also you get a krogan in the Citadel DLC in 3
[3:36:11] <Warbot40> Humans are the worst part of mass effect. They're so boring.
[3:36:14] <%Maids4lyfe> hyper racist ashley
[3:36:14] <%Garthunox> Will you be saving the space racist or space Carth?
[3:36:17] <%thbluewarden> krogans rule
[3:36:17] <An_Armed_Bear> Man I kept screwing this part up for my group the first time I ran it, everyone just shouted at me to "go top" and I had no clue what was happening
[3:36:18] <%the38bandit> Wrex's mission in me3 is the best one
[3:36:21] <%Valdorick> Qauds
[3:36:23] <%shurtal> not having a front or wrex in the party was a downer, and Freddy prinz Jr doesn't count
[3:36:26] <%Raiden_Breaker> Human that looks like krogan
[3:36:26] <%rkbinder> It is interesting that the game lets you make it shit
[3:36:26] <+lanik745> that don't work
[3:36:27] <%BoxNavy> thats awesome
[3:36:27] <CountMeowingtonn> "wrex, shepard"
[3:36:28] <Chimeraelite> and NONE OF THEM WORK
[3:36:28] <%CalderGaming> none of which work anymore ayyyyyy
[3:36:29] <BigNerdSam> Four Ball Run
[3:36:30] <thetunnelhomer> Wrex or Grunt. Who is the best Kro-bro?
[3:36:34] <%Mendin> Oh like Josuke?
[3:36:39] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt I bet that if you change literally nothing but move Homecoming to a post-Destroy ending the game is still 10x better
[3:36:41] <+UberWolfman> At least we get a Female Turian
[3:36:45] <%rkbinder> More like Honey Badgers
[3:36:52] <%shadowsofpain> Krogans are super cool but I love that Javik is a party member in 3
[3:36:54] <%transporterthesequel> Four more than Geif EYYYYYYEE
[3:36:58] <%Pappajimbo> the had had nuclear war on their plant and they were like lol whatever
[3:36:59] <Chimeraelite> oh jesus fuck
[3:36:59] <$KnivesEve> sounds hot
[3:37:00] <oedocontroller> they work too good
[3:37:01] <%BoxNavy> jermaPluto
[3:37:02] <%CalderGaming> oh right
[3:37:03] <Chimeraelite> I forgot about that
[3:37:04] <%BestTeaMaker> Eve is the best krogan
[3:37:04] <+ratearth> Wrex is the sexiest character in ME sorry
[3:37:04] <Warbot40> Javik is awesome at least
[3:37:15] <%Teyaric> so they HAVE the pregnancy. But it FAILS. It's depressing as shit!
[3:37:18] <%QueequegTheater> Yeah the genophage is fucking horrific
[3:37:20] <%the38bandit> Javiks's gun is super broken for the allies
[3:37:21] <An_Armed_Bear> Fuck the Salarians
[3:37:21] <Blank9> and they just gotta keep trying so that a handful might make it
[3:37:21] <%Raikouija> That‚Äôs fucked up
[3:37:22] <+ratearth> Wait no, Garrus exists
[3:37:23] <%Maids4lyfe> demoralizing as fuck
[3:37:24] <%JoshManVGH> So it's demoralizing as fuuuuck
[3:37:26] <takkarwestmarch> Patrick how hard is the lion kill team compared to normal
[3:37:30] <Hoodywolf> its super fucked
[3:37:35] <CountMeowingtonn> i love how in me1, garrus does not regret the genophage AT ALL
[3:37:38] <+megaman_sentinel> just f***** up that's what it is
[3:37:40] <%rkbinder> Salarians are all psycopaths racialy
[3:37:44] <+ThomasOfTroy> Yeah, it's insanely fucked up
[3:37:45] <thetunnelhomer> Man, Garrus in a modern context is weird.
[3:37:45] <zer0enixx> Krogan hospitals are a real downer
[3:37:56] <thetunnelhomer> Cause he's super cool, but he is also a terrible cop.
[3:38:02] <%Valdorick> Calcium babies.
[3:38:02] <T_Sasquatch> you do realise the krogan were fucking up the world BEFORE the genophage.
[3:38:03] <%Teyaric> Salarians are the type who literally don't see a point in /declaring/ war
[3:38:12] <%ssjklyco> You gotta make sure to emotionally scar them on top of genocide
[3:38:15] <%QueequegTheater> Garrus isn't a cop for 95% of the series
[3:38:16] <Chimeraelite> pretty hard to get more horrifying than that
[3:38:19] <%Ynkubus_> and that it took a galxywide threat for folk to try undo the damage
[3:38:29] <%Cjjb1995> I think any form of genocide would be considered immoral though
[3:38:32] <iosephe> he is tho
[3:38:34] <thetunnelhomer> Garrus is still 100% a cop for most of ME!
[3:38:36] <%Teyaric> he's a batman with a gun - COP Deluxe
[3:38:38] <balthazar758> ):
[3:38:42] <Blank9> he's a cop in spirit
[3:38:43] <%Lion_kun> Garrus is hot, he can be a fascist all he wants.
[3:38:45] <%Cjjb1995> He absolutely is a cop
[3:38:46] <%rkbinder> salarian childhood is fucked up
[3:38:49] <Sunstalker> T_Sasquatch Because they were created for that. And they got too good at it and then they implemented the Genophage out of fear of them
[3:38:50] <DanThePumpkinman> the one thing i know about ME is that garrus is a fuckin cop
[3:38:50] <%Cjjb1995> how is he not!?
[3:38:52] <%thbluewarden> ooooof
[3:38:53] <Chimeraelite> Lul
[3:38:54] <thetunnelhomer> ME1* I mean
[3:38:56] <+ZipperHands> He quit so he can be the Punisher
[3:38:56] <Chimeraelite> PFFF
[3:38:57] <T_Sasquatch> @Cjjb1995 ay man, the rachni gotta go
[3:38:59] <%Valdorick> the 5% he is is because he's an action hero renegade cop.
[3:39:03] <Blank9> he is the aspirational loose cannon cop who doesn't play by the rules
[3:39:05] <+atteroproxy> he bbecame Punisher
[3:39:05] <%MidnightBurst12> too much of a cop to be a cop
[3:39:07] <%Valdorick> "I'll turn in my OWN badge! BUT NOT THE GUN!"
[3:39:07] <+ratearth> Garrus might be a fascist but he's a sexy fascist so it's ok
[3:39:08] <%Raikouija> LOL
[3:39:09] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> 1 drop of cop
[3:39:09] <%Wallabri> yeah..........
[3:39:10] <+megaman_sentinel> why are you tanking
[3:39:15] <CountMeowingtonn> Garrus quit being a cop because he wanted to become the punisher
[3:39:22] <%ssjklyco> So he wanted to be an earth cop
[3:39:28] <%Teyaric> By Turian standards, to be fair - he's yer basic action movie cop by human standards.
[3:39:29] <%Mr_Pylon> he's  budget brand Punisher
[3:39:31] <%Cjjb1995> @T_Sasquatch TRUE
[3:39:32] <%MisterRockett> What if Dirty Harry actually stayed off the force after the first movie.
[3:39:32] <tanarath> No, to WANNABE Punisher.
[3:39:33] <Hoodywolf> earth cop
[3:39:34] <+aphotophilic> he shouldve just moved to the US
[3:39:41] <Ipsenscastle> In ME1 Garrus' side mission is that he's mad a bad guy got away when C-Sec stopped him from blowing up a ship full of hostages above a residential area
[3:39:43] <%JoshManVGH> He became a cop to rough people up and not do paperwork. he hates paperwork, he's a cop
[3:39:49] <%the38bandit> Archangel garrus
[3:39:54] <$PhantomMiG> I am the turians have basicly a fascist state
[3:40:00] <meteor530> Now quickly skin him for gems
[3:40:00] <T_Sasquatch> @Sunstalker the salarians fucked up because they needed the krogan to defeat the rachni BUT the krogan even after the genophage refuse to develop and they fucked up their own homeworld on their own
[3:40:02] <%Maids4lyfe> Garrus literally wanted to be a specter because specters can kill whoever they want based only on their own hearsay
[3:40:05] <%Valdorick> "I made 4 space pirate gangs team up on me because I killed them so bad"
[3:40:06] <+OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Then he became Batman On Omage
[3:40:15] <%Agami23> wait, how many memories does castrum give???
[3:40:18] <%pokefan9956> what if bioware made a disco elysium-like where you play as garrus
[3:40:27] <Daniel_Is_I> @Agami23 5
[3:40:28] <T_Sasquatch> also just i think the genophage was necessary but i still cured it LUL
[3:40:29] <Hoodywolf> what kind of memories?
[3:40:30] <%Teyaric> You know, the whole ME Universe is super pro facism, when you look at it. Kinda crazy.
[3:40:33] <%BoxNavy> ARF
[3:40:34] <CountMeowingtonn> paragon shepard can put garrus back on the path of good and not being the punisher
[3:40:34] <%furiousfurioso> psaDogchamp
[3:40:35] <Arweynn> BORK
[3:40:38] <+aphotophilic> big bork
[3:40:39] <%vivaldiva> bork
[3:40:39] <%Wallabri> ARF
[3:40:40] <oedocontroller> that sounded like vomit
[3:40:40] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[3:40:42] <%QueequegTheater> I just find it annoying that nobody is allowed to have character flaws anymore.  The entire point of his arc in 1 and 2 is that he IS WRONG but the current political climate makes people super sensitive
[3:40:42] <+hightiermortal> bork
[3:40:43] <%solracc25> speak
[3:40:46] <Hoodywolf> I dont remember which part that works well with
[3:40:47] <tacotaskforce> well, ME is the future, so
[3:40:47] <heart_raid_> baby must be heard
[3:40:47] <$KnivesEve> gief does not like 5
[3:40:52] <+ThreeStrikes_> how many stages are there for this expansions relic weapon?
[3:40:53] <tanarath> The boi senses the daemon
[3:40:54] <Blank9> mordin is the best character
[3:40:54] <plaguedoctor_syan> Grief did not like that it only gives 5
[3:40:59] <%MidnightBurst12> thus spake gief
[3:41:03] <TrollKing96> Wait, if you do Garrus related side-stuff doesn't he get better?
[3:41:04] <NeonBleu> Zief agrees
[3:41:06] <marcdyllan> I'm so confused, I know nothing about ME except the two names you'ved mentioned in the past few minutes and seeing ppl calling them "best..."  and now you're telling me they all sorts of Fe'd up....can't wait till Friday
[3:41:09] <%StevorenoElcamino> He expected a high five lol
[3:41:10] <meteor530> Are giefs ballz removed yet?
[3:41:11] <%Agami23> oh jesus christ, i went for 15 crystal towers instead
[3:41:13] <%QueequegTheater> Gief destroys the party
[3:41:14] <%Cjjb1995> games have come a long way since the mass effect trilogy came out
[3:41:16] <NitronStreams> fuck mass effect is 10 years old
[3:41:16] <%AzureGale> I hope Woolie does an LP of Mass Effect
[3:41:20] <%pokefan9956> post disco elysium society
[3:41:21] <+MidnightBurst12> oof
[3:41:27] <%Maids4lyfe> me3 should have never happened, it should have just been about finding a way to stop the reapers from getting into the galaxy
[3:41:28] <$PhantomMiG> @patstaresat I mean you are going from Disco to Mass Effect
[3:41:30] <NitronStreams> ah fuck
[3:41:30] <Ralfclogs> Gief says Bork
[3:41:36] <CountMeowingtonn> i played mass effect 2 when i was 13, Mirandas romance scene awakened me to a whole new world.
[3:41:38] <+megaman_sentinel> it seems more f***** up than you remember right
[3:41:41] <tanarath> @trollking96 and then back to worse in 2,but actually good in 3
[3:41:43] <TrollKing96> @PatStaresAt Wait, if you do Garrus related side-stuff doesn't he get better?
[3:41:47] <T_Sasquatch> LUL
[3:41:47] <Nupinoop296> oh dear
[3:41:47] <%monsieurfantastic> monsieurfantastic subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 7 months! Started a new job after being without one for basically a year. So can't watch live as much anymore but glad you're still good and up to you're orbman ways. Also the deadly P 2 playthrough you did is honestly one of my favourites things ever. Pet babies
[3:41:48] <Louie_Salmon> Big Raiden energy
[3:41:58] <%Wallabri> that sure is a big yikes
[3:42:01] <T_Sasquatch> spectres are such a mistake LUL
[3:42:04] <Blank9> listen pat, mass effect needs a kirk, not a picard
[3:42:10] <%W1nterTitan> oh no
[3:42:12] <%CalderGaming> but he DOES
[3:42:12] <%QueequegTheater> @TrollKing96 no, no one is allowed to have nuance on the internet
[3:42:13] <Ipsenscastle> I didn't think much had changed in 10 years but it is slightly weird to go back to
[3:42:13] <%transporterthesequel> Some of those people are POLITICIANS NOW
[3:42:13] <%BestTeaMaker> HE DID
[3:42:13] <+megaman_sentinel> what no political leader would do that
[3:42:14] <tacotaskforce> yeah that sure does sound like a game that started development during the push to get into the Iraq war.
[3:42:16] <heart_raid_> oh god it is like that isn't it
[3:42:16] <%Raikouija> Oh you mean like Raiden in Revengance?!?
[3:42:16] <%Valdorick> I mena... in a way... didn't he?
[3:42:17] <An_Armed_Bear> The council COULD be less dickish though
[3:42:17] <Chimeraelite> LUL
[3:42:18] <AmuserName> OWCH, that's a BIG PAINFUL
[3:42:19] <%BestTeaMaker> HE DID TELL THEM THAT
[3:42:19] <%shurtal> oh no
[3:42:20] <%Rumbutt> Pat that's literally what happened in the game
[3:42:20] <thetunnelhomer> Mass Effect needs a Sisko
[3:42:21] <afronooch> Big bush jr vibes
[3:42:21] <iosephe> It's TRUE
[3:42:21] <%Maids4lyfe> BUT HE DID
[3:42:22] <%psydaku> tbf udina wouldn't be wrong
[3:42:23] <Chimeraelite> *WHEEEZE*
[3:42:23] <oedocontroller> which he does have
[3:42:27] <%Frost_Quill> I had to go away to eat with my family and came back to ME discussion.  You guys talk about Tali at all?  I like her, she's my favorite.
[3:42:28] <$PhantomMiG> He does
[3:42:32] <Chimeraelite> HE DOES I KNOW OH GDO
[3:42:33] <%Ynkubus_> Satins boss is a weapon of mass destruction
[3:42:35] <%pokefan9956> is saren sadam?
[3:42:42] <%QueequegTheater> WHO CARES, IT'S FICTION
[3:42:44] <%TheYellowcouch> Man ME is like super fucked in retrospect lol
[3:42:45] <CountMeowingtonn> we talked about how wrong Tali is
[3:42:46] <+ALazo> Should've taken pics smh
[3:42:50] <tanarath> Why didn't they bring cameras?
[3:42:51] <%SaiyanShoto> Isn‚Äôt ME older than 10 years? I could‚Äôve sworn it came out when I was in high school
[3:42:54] <Blank9> Which class are you going with?
[3:42:56] <%QueequegTheater> IT IS MY ESCAPISM, PAT
[3:42:58] <Valdorick> If Sheperd was a Spector at that time, would Saren have just been fucking iced then and there?
[3:43:02] <wibbwobbler> LUL
[3:43:06] <tanarath> Or ANY method of getting proof?
[3:43:06] <+atteroproxy> ME3 Starts because the council doesn nothing
[3:43:08] <Nupinoop296> wow
[3:43:09] <Sunstalker> So why are you getting upset then? Just ignore them LUL
[3:43:10] <%vaporousTippler> I mean, been to a church?
[3:43:11] <AmuserName> Shepard didn't even SEE SAREN, he just listened to LAZY DOCKWORKER! LUL
[3:43:12] <Hoodywolf> fiction should make sense so you can be somewhat invested
[3:43:12] <CountMeowingtonn> there is a lot of genocide or attempted genocide in mass effect
[3:43:13] <afronooch> @SaiyanShoto me3 was 12, me1 was 07
[3:43:15] <%BoxNavy> i HATE fiction
[3:43:15] <+gwanzan> fiction > reality
[3:43:17] <%MidnightBurst12> that's a boring take
[3:43:22] <%QueequegTheater> I just want a fun space romp without Twitter screaming FASCISM at me like I don't know fascism is bad
[3:43:22] <oedocontroller> i know it's a bit of blasphemy but i'm really curious if they left the same polish dubbing for it. ME is amazing in polish
[3:43:23] <%Rumbutt> @SaiyanShoto ME 1 was 2008, 2 was 2010, 3 was 2012
[3:43:24] <Hoodywolf> it takes you out of it if its all nonsense lmao
[3:43:26] <DianaTheAscian> wait whats happening?
[3:43:29] <iosephe> Fiction is used as an excuse for real actions (e.g. fictional weapons of mass destruction)
[3:43:31] <%JoshManVGH> We gotta hunt down Sarin because of a dream this one dude had!
[3:43:36] <%Teyaric> Once again, Queequeg is all "STOP THE POLITICS" - Shameful.
[3:43:37] <NitronStreams> life is cringe
[3:43:38] <%Maids4lyfe> we care because fiction helps us in reality
[3:43:44] <An_Armed_Bear> ThEy'Re PuTTiNg PoliTiCs iN mY MaSs EfFeCt
[3:43:44] <+NoWayRyanTatum> Pat did you not say the same thing to Woolie about characters in 13 Sentinals???
[3:43:46] <heart_raid_> even if it is fiction, we should probably be critical of it
[3:43:47] <Wolfstriker121> svu or the new one
[3:43:47] <ethey16> yeah, people care about the bible
[3:43:49] <thetunnelhomer> @QueequegTheater Politics are important
[3:43:50] <%moonmintparadise> Law and Order in Space
[3:43:53] <%Cjjb1995> I think Queequeg is right in that when most real world logic is brought into fiction the logical answer is normally "IT'S NOT REAL"
[3:44:00] <balthazar758> i love cringe
[3:44:03] <%pokefan9956> no politics WutFace
[3:44:03] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Yeah fiction is dumb don't play videogames
[3:44:06] <CountMeowingtonn> THEY SHOULD MAKE LAW AND ORDER IN SPACE
[3:44:08] <+SuicidalLemmming> you can care about fiction. just dont get upset over it, since its not real
[3:44:14] <%QueequegTheater> @thetunnelhomer no they aren't, I don't give a shit
[3:44:17] <TrollKing96> @tanarath Then why do people act like he never gets better?
[3:44:18] <afronooch> LUL
[3:44:22] <thetunnelhomer> I can't wait for the next super apolitical game Six days in Fallujah.
[3:44:25] <%StevorenoElcamino> That‚Äôs one of those ‚Äúthought terminating cliches‚Äù
[3:44:26] <DanThePumpkinman> everything is politics
[3:44:26] <%Maids4lyfe> law & order went to shit when that actor quit
[3:44:28] <Nupinoop296> Garrus is for people who wanna fuck Stabler then?
[3:44:29] <+gwanzan> wasn't Garrius dad a general?
[3:44:31] <+Frost_Quill> Is Garrus his species version of bald?
[3:44:32] <Blank9> they even both have semen that would ravage your innards if ingested
[3:44:32] <%Agami23> you can consume and enjoy a piece of media while still being critical about it.
[3:44:33] <%rkbinder> both hate grapists
[3:44:33] <Priapeia> is stabler bald?
[3:44:34] <Chimeraelite> IMAGINE IF HE WAS BASED OFF HIM
[3:44:42] <Sunstalker> Fictional people HAVE to be the worst and make the worst decisions or you can't tell a story showing you why they are the worst or make the worst decisions kinamaLUL
[3:44:42] <LordDudeTheFirst> They're both bald LUL
[3:44:45] <%DamnFineCupofStreaming> they both have a cloaca
[3:44:51] <i_chevalier> @patstaresat hows geif?
[3:44:52] <%Agami23> fucking same
[3:44:53] <doggieo> I dont know how I feel about this revelation
[3:44:54] <Ipsenscastle> same
[3:45:01] <BigNerdSam> I don't know SVU, is Stapler a cop that kills criminals with a stapler?
[3:45:02] <$PhantomMiG> Same
[3:45:07] <+UberWolfman> LUL
[3:45:08] <+gwanzan> what?
[3:45:17] <doctor_kelso> You can't tell me that it's impossible to notice a large number of people obsessed with Star Trek also wound up being libertarians when they grew up.
[3:45:17] <%TheYellowcouch> You can still find cops hot and be a class traitor! these are not mutually exclusive
[3:45:18] <%valriot> DUMPY
[3:45:18] <%Raikouija> I wonder what its like fucking a Turian tbh
[3:45:19] <blackblackffxiv> same, I annoy the shit out of my friends with how critical I am of media lol
[3:45:19] <afronooch> he thicc

[3:45:38] <blackblackffxiv> I dont know how people shut their brains off and not analyze media to enjoy it.
[3:45:38] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt I still can't believe how hard SVU falls off right away
[3:45:38] <%Dunsparcetheglare> Lest we forget about Samara who dedicated 400 years to killing her genetic defective daughter
[3:45:40] <+megaman_sentinel> don't do that kids
[3:45:40] <DanThePumpkinman> wonderful, magical dreams
[3:45:40] <LordDudeTheFirst> No Pat I don't think I will
[3:45:41] <+Qexec> I don't think I will.
[3:45:44] <%CalderGaming> alright pat time to click on every player here and see who's running Essences

[3:45:52] <%valriot> THATS A HUGE ASS
[3:45:52] <%Raikouija> A dumptruck you‚Äôd say?
[3:45:59] <trianglehat> LUL
[3:46:00] <balthazar758> absolute unit
[3:46:05] <%ClericOfSparda> lol
[3:46:09] <%QueequegTheater> Wasn't that Willem Dafoe
[3:46:12] <%Agami23> wtf why does he have such a dumptruck?
[3:46:12] <+gwanzan> I have underestimated the depth of Pat's SVU deep dive
[3:46:12] <wibbwobbler> Dude is in shape
[3:46:13] <%ssjklyco> William Defoe
[3:46:16] <Ner234> LUL
[3:46:16] <DanThePumpkinman> seeing him naked in Happy was a blessing
[3:46:16] <nevan_44> LUL
[3:46:20] <+ZipperHands> That was William Defoe
[3:46:20] <%SaiyanShoto> I searched it and all I got is videos of people stapling their booty cheeks...
[3:46:21] <Ralfclogs> DR huge ass LUL
[3:46:22] <blackblackffxiv> LUL
[3:46:32] <iosephe> oh wow that butt
[3:46:33] <%ClericOfSparda> That's utterly ridiculous
[3:46:34] <%Zundelle> oh no this dick is too much for me
[3:46:35] <+gwanzan> big dick stories
[3:46:37] <oedocontroller> big dick energy ruining movies
[3:46:38] <%Ynkubus_> Willem Defoes was because his dick was too big
[3:46:39] <Chimeraelite> well damn
[3:46:40] <%Pappajimbo> "i'm trying to catch the pedos but the clap of my dumm thcc cheeks keeps alerting them."
[3:46:42] <%solracc25> "sex with clothes on"
[3:46:43] <DanThePumpkinman> i watch that show repeatedly purely for Chris Meloni's ass
[3:46:44] <%CalderGaming> DRG, and SAM have no essence applied, rip
[3:46:45] <%JoshManVGH> William Defao has litteral big dick energy.
[3:46:49] <%GIGA255> Stabler's Butt: ***
[3:46:52] <iosephe> oh boy the rotational mercies
[3:46:52] <TrollKing96> Is the movie called AntiChrist?
[3:46:53] <%QueequegTheater> I mean I'm not saying you're wrong but I definitely also heard that abouth Defoe
[3:46:56] <%Agami23> no willem defoe is the one who people were scared of and called his size "grotesque" i think
[3:46:59] <%Valdorick> Bitch Ravana
[3:46:59] <%CalderGaming> and the WHM
[3:47:03] <%BestTeaMaker> your SAM is already dead
[3:47:03] <+ZipperHands> I believe the story was specifically about William Defoe in The Antichrist
[3:47:06] <Chimeraelite> I don't hear any opera. TRASH FIGHT
[3:47:07] <CountMeowingtonn> GOD DAMN WHY IS STABLER DRAGGING A WAGON
[3:47:12] <animaturgy> I want a Ravana mount
[3:47:15] <%QueequegTheater> LUL
[3:47:15] <+gwanzan> damn, I didn't look at the name and could have sworn it was Ravanna
[3:47:16] <LordDudeTheFirst> That mercy phase makes my brain feel smooth
[3:47:19] <+BIumen> no see it's because uh the gnath originated in bozja
[3:47:21] <plaguedoctor_syan> i was just doing Ravana right now
[3:47:26] <+ZipperHands> Guess they didn't want to gore his massive cock
[3:47:26] <Hoodywolf> I feel like delebrum is so much easier than castrum
[3:47:30] <Kain5707> Pat i guarantee if you throw tank stance youll out dps this tank
[3:47:31] <An_Armed_Bear> Yeah this one's rough
[3:47:39] <An_Armed_Bear> But I don't like 24 man stuff in general
[3:47:42] <thetunnelhomer> DR has some wacky build possibilites.
[3:47:44] <%BestTeaMaker> @Hoodywolf it's easier, but that doesn't mean people are better
[3:47:45] <$KnivesEve> do i have to do relics?
[3:47:57] <Kain5707> they probably dont have essence though
[3:48:01] <Hoodywolf> thats true
[3:48:04] <%Garthunox> @KnivesEve completely optional
[3:48:07] <%Mendin> For those who haven't done DR: All of these bosses have a sub-gimmick where getting bopped by their mechanics stacks a debuff on you - two stacks of the debuff Instantly Inflicts Doom
[3:48:07] <mr_red117> DR is where you feel when everyone else isnt using essences
[3:48:08] <%Zepik> DR's fine it's just all the randos in there that refuse to use essences that make it take like an hour
[3:48:12] <AsterKalix> More like bitchbreaker
[3:48:16] <%StevorenoElcamino> I love DR for some reason
[3:48:19] <%GIGA255> all gear being equal, there is no reason for a GNB to lose aggro to anyone.
[3:48:21] <$KnivesEve> neato
[3:48:31] <DanThePumpkinman> D:
[3:48:31] <%Mendin> So DR just goes "fuck you die" a lot from people getting clipped despite healers adjusting
[3:48:34] <nevan_44> D:
[3:48:36] <$Ziegsy> I also bark when I need to pee
[3:48:44] <Kain5707> gear doesnt matter in DR
[3:48:46] <oedocontroller> been here for an hour. Still have no clue what am i looking at
[3:48:48] <%shurtal> hes working hard for the money, gief
[3:48:49] <%Rumbutt> Nice that living shadow gives you aggro now
[3:48:50] <Kain5707> you can run it naked
[3:48:53] <Fefe41> As a newbie tank is there any guides I should read up on?
[3:48:55] <@CreepyPorpoise> can't believe I'm being forced to heal smh
[3:49:02] <%Maids4lyfe> what's DR?
[3:49:03] <%shurtal> unless the next step requires it
[3:49:09] <%Agami23> i want to be free from DR. yet i suffer
[3:49:10] <AsterKalix> I remember running this and genuinely watching some one die so much I lost count. It was around 25+
[3:49:14] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt How many relics did you get past the final step, just the DRK?
[3:49:16] <DaydreamDisaster> I ran DR 3 times a day, every day, for idk how many weeks/months. Just watching this is making me feel sick lol. Never going there again. (i hope)
[3:49:18] <ClassicBonor> how many timeworns have you for this relic so far?
[3:49:34] <%Mendin> JoCat's "A Crap Guide To Final Fantasy XIV - Tanks" i am not kidding
[3:49:36] <Kain5707> i hope they give 3 per clear starting tomorrow
[3:49:39] <afronooch> i did 4 :/
[3:49:45] <%Mendin> @Fefe41
[3:49:46] <%QueequegTheater> I did DRG, WAR, and half of RDM, I literally never want to see Palace ever again
[3:49:48] <%baronouroboros> just started playing FFXIV, and I've come to understand that the combat's just about managing ability cooldowns and dodging aoe attacks
[3:49:52] <DianaTheAscian> oh wow thats way easier than what I do
[3:50:00] <%Zepik> i couldn't be bothered cause raid weapons, now I pray they nerf the old steps
[3:50:05] <Kain5707> thatd be cool
[3:50:08] <wibbwobbler> This game rules
[3:50:08] <%LaughingCatt> thatd make sense
[3:50:10] <%dumemoto> I made a new character the other day to actually play through the story (because I bought skips on my main to play with friends) and boy oh boy. It's a chore.
[3:50:13] <LordDudeTheFirst> I'd be cool with that
[3:50:17] <Hoodywolf> whats a dr
[3:50:28] <DianaTheAscian> yeah
[3:50:29] <%QueequegTheater> @Hoodywolf delubrum reginae
[3:50:32] <tacotaskforce> and I still get to be sweaty in a deep dungeon
[3:50:34] <DianaTheAscian> this is dr
[3:50:34] <Kain5707> a doctor :)
[3:50:35] <%Monkeyweed21> yea they'll prolly lower it to 1 or 2 dr a week
[3:50:35] <Hoodywolf> ah
[3:50:39] <Hoodywolf> thank you
[3:50:39] <An_Armed_Bear> DR is the raid he's doing
[3:50:59] <Hoodywolf> there is a mount here?
[3:51:01] <%Maids4lyfe> but what does it mean?
[3:51:08] <Riorii> it also wont happen :)
[3:51:12] <Kain5707> you know whats fun running this as a whm with a wand and shield
[3:51:14] <%QueequegTheater> I like the normal version more
[3:51:14] <%Mendin> Delubrum Reginae
[3:51:16] <Kain5707> because it does block
[3:51:20] <Rei_Dsoto> That would be AMAZING
[3:51:21] <+gwanzan> @dumemoto you don't like the best Final Fantasy story?  It picks up after ARR,
[3:51:21] <LordDudeTheFirst> Everyone say DR because no one knows how to say Delubrum Reginae
[3:51:21] <afronooch> out of like 60, i only got the hair twice
[3:51:22] <Hoodywolf> I've ran this one a ton and I had no idea
[3:51:22] <AsterKalix> super low chance of it even dropping
[3:51:23] <Zepik> or get the hair, sell it, and buy 5 gold mounts
[3:51:31] <%Monkeyweed21> more like GAYbriel
[3:51:31] <%Maids4lyfe> thank you @Mendin
[3:51:32] <Rei_Dsoto> Thought it would only drop inSavage though
[3:51:38] <Riorii> only ever seen chess pieces and coins from DR
[3:51:41] <+Brannax> You've done it all these times and not gotten it? Yikes. RNG is a bitch.
[3:51:41] <+DocSigma> it also drops a hairstyle rarely but I don't remember what it is
[3:51:45] <An_Armed_Bear> Man I want to play Reaper so bad I don't wanna wait 6 months
[3:51:47] <%Teyaric> Oh wow that thing looks like a budget jehuty I love it

[3:52:07] <%CalderGaming> MOTH TURN ON YOUR ESSENCE
[3:52:08] <%QueequegTheater> @Teyaric it's meant to be a Nier Automata flight unit
[3:52:13] <Fefe41> @mendin I'd question this if I've never seen his MH vids before and know how accurate it can be lol, thanks
[3:52:18] <%TheYellowcouch> damn it pat you blew me up!
[3:52:22] <@mothmandraws> my essence fell off

[3:52:41] <Kain5707> this fucking guy LUL
[3:52:41] <%WhereIsWill> i've ran so many of these my gawd LUL
[3:52:47] <%LaughingCatt> not quite
[3:52:49] <tacotaskforce> Oh, the translation of "Delubrum Reginae" is "the queen's shrine". That makes sense
[3:52:56] <%Rumbutt> are you Pat?
[3:53:02] <Kain5707> no me :)
[3:53:03] <%Rumbutt> oh now you are
[3:53:08] <%valriot> Pats the type of tank i pulled from with raw DPS, no Provoke needed
[3:53:12] <%QueequegTheater> I think XIV's controller support and multiclass have literally ruined all other MMOs for me
[3:53:12] <DianaTheAscian> thankfully people melt this guy nowadays
[3:53:17] <+zepelinnn1> still mad that our stand is just a DoT
[3:53:17] <%Mendin> Big fat pickle tail
[3:53:21] <%StevorenoElcamino> Not anymore lol
[3:53:34] <%WhereIsWill> what essense is pat runnin?
[3:53:35] <Kain5707> essence makes a huge fucking difference
[3:53:37] <+Cuon_Alpinus> SICK
[3:53:39] <%Monkeyweed21> there should be a DPS bonus for syncing up with Esteem
[3:53:43] <SaltyAzteca> He's doing it
[3:53:45] <An_Armed_Bear> Discount Deviljho over here
[3:53:46] <%valriot> Ill just use all the skills to get 80k crit GNB skills LUL
[3:53:50] <AsagiRyuu> pat dont you have grit though
[3:53:50] <%LaughingCatt> negating a knockback with your gap closer is the best feeling lobosHype
[3:53:55] <RaidenRising> sup guys , you can play healer with d pad ?
[3:53:56] <+TestAnon> @PatStaresAt how do you feel about unique class mechanics for bosses/raids in MMO's? I know each calls can have unique buffs but in wow classes there's some bosses you can't beat with out a specific class.
[3:53:58] <Kain5707> you still have it LUL
[3:54:01] <%Valdorick> Haaaaaaaaaa, coward, had to provoke
[3:54:07] <afronooch> @RaidenRising yes
[3:54:08] <%QueequegTheater> Doesn't GNB have like 15% higher DPS though
[3:54:18] <%Agami23> man living shadow is so cool.
[3:54:22] <Kain5707> not here
[3:54:30] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Pat, did you see the video of the girl who's sub expired during the MIDDLE of Diamond Weapon EX?
[3:54:30] <RaidenRising> oh cool, i want to start this in ps5
[3:54:30] <%Agami23> i wish paladin had a cool stand
[3:54:32] <%Zepik> lol no a percentage or 2 at most
[3:54:33] <%QueequegTheater> It's definitely the highest though
[3:54:36] <Kain5707> DR is pretty balanced for tanks
[3:54:36] <Riorii> it just plays like a dps
[3:54:39] <aeonicvector> its clsoer to 6% iirc
[3:54:39] <%BestTeaMaker> that was a fast one
[3:54:44] <%QueequegTheater> @AlteisenReiseZ oh my god
[3:54:46] <%the22cstomp> it's more like 3-4% at most
[3:54:49] <%CzeekyTV> GNB lines up so nicely with Trick Attack <3
[3:54:49] <Yakobro> @QueequegTheater if you don't fuck up
[3:54:52] <%Valdorick> snicker
[3:54:58] <Veluren> I greatly love how the balance in this game is tight enough to not matter unless you're trying to do ultimates
[3:55:00] <%Mekhet09> I saw you saying you were doing castrum and I was like that's better then what I'm doing which is leveling my level 1 classes. I need to catch up on my crafting too. It's hard to multimanage for me.
[3:55:00] <%Rumbutt> hahahahah
[3:55:03] <%WhereIsWill> @AlteisenReiseZ laynaWHYTHO laynaWHYTHO laynaWHYTHO

[3:55:20] <An_Armed_Bear> I didn't get the appeal of Gunbreaker until I unlocked the Fang/Claw/Talon combo
[3:55:21] <Hoodywolf> peepo
[3:55:25] <+Shillk> when are the patch notes dropping?
[3:55:32] <@CreepyPorpoise> *SCREAM*
[3:55:33] <Kain5707> i hope Zadnor is good

[3:55:42] <federleicht> a bit
[3:55:46] <SkellyOfficial> what resistance rank do you have to be to do castrum?
[3:55:52] <+RhysLG> RhysLG subscribed with Prime. 
[3:55:52] <%VioletHeart> It'd be pretty cringe, yeah.
[3:55:53] <Chimeraelite> oh jfc the healer just died

[3:55:58] <+TestAnon> would be quite the inconvenience

[3:56:02] <%QueequegTheater> @SkellyOfficial 10
[3:56:08] <Yakobro> @Veluren It doesn't matter in ultimates, when ucob came out the first clear was with a drk, they asked them "why drk it does less dmg is it because of the magic mit?" and the guy was like "I like drk"
[3:56:10] <balthazar758> oh yeah
[3:56:10] <%GIGA255> almost as depressing as Kentaro Mirua
[3:56:15] <+Mrbaconator> nah pat you would be regular single pat you aren't pathetic

[3:57:10] <+olive_js> @PatStaresAt I'm addicted to League and I've decided it's your fault.
[3:57:10] <oedocontroller> what do you need big pp for when you're single?
[3:57:17] <%RhysLG> don't lie, single pat was 24/7 jerkin

[3:58:27] <%Agami23> i mean, i know a few guys

[3:58:36] <SaltyAzteca> @zepelinnn1 Kappa
[3:58:37] <%QueequegTheater> Pat doesn't even know about sounding
[3:58:37] <%MidnightBurst12> that's what you think
[3:58:39] <balthazar758> the secret technique
[3:58:39] <%AzureGale> What if a fish decides your wiener looks like a tasty worm
[3:58:41] <erogenousjones> dedicated*
[3:58:42] <An_Armed_Bear> the candiru
[3:58:44] <%MaxeusTheFirst> I've never really watched or played this game, but done 15 years of WoW. Seeing how simple these bosses are compared to WoWs now bosses makes me feel envious.
[3:58:45] <%Mekhet09> It sounds ike you've never tried it.
[3:58:46] <+FingaLights> Sound Off chat
[3:58:50] <%Dakuu75> -that fish from the amazon river
[3:58:51] <%GIGA255> Google: Urethral Sounding
[3:58:52] <Qsmash_> unless you're into that

[3:58:54] <%Mekhet09> What a cowered.
[3:58:56] <+OmegaWeltall> get Pat a sounding Rod Kappa
[3:59:00] <%MisterRockett> Yeah but fuck it up in a cool way
[3:59:05] <%NopeBadguy> @MaxeusTheFirst OH IT GETS MUCH HARDER
[3:59:10] <%Daxalog> Only if your a professional. Then you can put things in there.
[3:59:14] <$Ziegsy> Simple
[3:59:15] <Slim_Lipid> @MaxeusTheFirst shouldn't you pity their smooth brains instead
[3:59:16] <%JoshManVGH> Came back in time for gague weeiner talk.
[3:59:16] <%valriot> Thats a load out bullshit LUL
[3:59:16] <%NopeBadguy> @MaxeusTheFirst Go look up Savage and Ultimate
[3:59:19] <%MaxeusTheFirst> Yeah, all the bs mechanics.
[3:59:23] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> these are scrub bosses for scrubs
[3:59:25] <%Mekhet09> Unless you do savage
[3:59:28] <Kain5707> i mean DR is simple
[3:59:32] <%Valdorick> Yeah, this is like WoW's LFR
[3:59:39] <Kain5707> Savage and Ultimate however
[3:59:41] <%QueequegTheater> @MaxeusTheFirst a better comparison is Extreme trials, those are the standard raid tier
[3:59:42] <$Ziegsy> this is the training raid
[3:59:50] <An_Armed_Bear> Dr's easy but man is it long
[3:59:52] <+KawaiiJetty> Even DR Savage isn't that complicated
[3:59:55] <%transporterthesequel> It‚Äôs super not
[3:59:56] <@Velyndra> DRS tho
[3:59:57] <%NopeBadguy> Well I mean Delubrum Savage is 48 man @PatStaresAt
[3:59:58] <%Agami23> man i was watching my brother do E4S and that hsit looks literally impossible
[4:00:03] <%WhereIsWill> DRS would like to have a word with you
[4:00:06] <%Mekhet09> Remember TGC before shadowbringers.
[4:00:07] <Yakobro> wormhole formation/NISI LUL
[4:00:08] <@JustinianKnight> there is a harder ver of this
[4:00:13] <@mothmandraws> its like molten core getting 2 mechanics
[4:00:13] <%QueequegTheater> @MaxeusTheFirst look up "Delubrum Reginae Savage" for the REAL version of this raid
[4:00:17] <%JoshManVGH> I prefer it when they try to make it interesting.
[4:00:26] <An_Armed_Bear> Like mistakes just come from pure fatigue at a certain point
[4:00:26] <DianaTheAscian> god...
[4:00:27] <Kain5707> just go watch a TEA clear if you want complex
[4:00:32] <%Zundelle> what do you mean just get 48 extremely competent people and get their schedules lined up
[4:00:35] <%transporterthesequel> More harsh dps reqs but as far as execution Savage kinda shits on WoW was far as complexity goes.
[4:00:39] <%QueequegTheater> That's why I'm grinding it
[4:00:45] <%Valdorick> Too bad his Glamor sucks, BAM GOTTEM
[4:00:49] <+TestAnon> love seeing videos of LFR with the entire raid just tanking all the damage lasers
[4:00:52] <%JoshManVGH> I want it so bad!
[4:00:57] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> The RDM weapon is easily my favorite out of this bunch. Tho I may be biased
[4:01:01] <plaguedoctor_syan> look for Thordan's Reign Ex if you want to see a FF14 complex thing
[4:01:02] <Kain5707> did the new relics leak yet LUL
[4:01:02] <+KawaiiJetty> TEA ultimate gives me nightmare to watch
[4:01:09] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt WoW definitely does have a better transmog system though
[4:01:11] <%BestTeaMaker> why does your shadow do quietus :V
[4:01:16] <%Dakuu75> I can't have fun until all the quest icons get off my map
[4:01:20] <Yakobro> @transporterthesequel min ilvl savage is fucked on some fights for dps reqs, week 1 shiva was HARD on prog groups, but it's not like wow where they expect you to gear up over weeks for the clears
[4:01:22] <%WhereIsWill> ive seen 144hrz monitor for the 1st time and its a GAMECHANGER
[4:01:22] <An_Armed_Bear> I feel weird for not liking the glowing weapons
[4:01:25] <%CzeekyTV> WoW (from the outside) seems like "oh you have the overpowered gear, you may clear"
[4:01:28] <%pokefan9956> @PatStaresAt , you see biomutant is apparently shit?
[4:01:31] <%Mekhet09> But pat don't you remember how fun thunder god cid was when it first came out?
[4:01:36] <Kain5707> you can only get vote kicked i think
[4:01:37] <%Zepik> i dont think anything can in instances
[4:01:38] <%Monkeyweed21> Cheer500 Hey Pat, you've said that you dont like city builders, but have you tried Tropico? It has campaign missions and political requests to guide you while building. You can even build the Big Communism in it
[4:01:47] <%TheYellowcouch> Just hold him out a window and squeeze
[4:01:49] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> @QueequegTheater seriously, FF14 needs a glam book, but theyll never do it because of the extra profit from extra retainers
[4:01:50] <$Afterman_> @pokefan9956 ive seen people say its actually fun, and some reviews gave it like an 8 or 9
[4:01:59] <tacotaskforce> @czeekytv not really, having the right kind of gear matters too
[4:02:00] <+MayorRev> shbake it harder
[4:02:03] <T_Sasquatch> @pokefan9956 this is one of the times where i completely ignore reviewers because the game simply looks too fun
[4:02:05] <%Monkeyweed21> just set auto run into a wall
[4:02:06] <TheFramedWarlock> Treat summon isn't working CrreamAwk
[4:02:07] <%Cjjb1995> not overly familiar with FF14 lore, what are the odds of Bahamut appearing in EndWalker?
[4:02:09] <tacotaskforce> unlike FF14 you can gear wrong in WoW.
[4:02:09] <Kain5707> go check on him D:
[4:02:15] <Hoodywolf> woof
[4:02:16] <Explodincatz> are u shaking it for us or the dog
[4:02:17] <%BestTeaMaker> LUL
[4:02:18] <%AzureGale> GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[4:02:23] <tanarath> Zangief is evolving additional needs in addition to food
[4:02:24] <%QueequegTheater> @qu3kl41n_the_impure_king at least the Mog Station money always goes back into the game instead of the company at large
[4:02:24] <%WhereIsWill> oh no gief in critical condition LUL
[4:02:24] <+Cuon_Alpinus> goodybe pat's mettle
[4:02:24] <tacotaskforce> @Cjjb1995 Bahamut killed the world in 1.0
[4:02:25] <%Dakuu75> afk during a raid, really?
[4:02:30] <%pokefan9956> true. reviewers could be wrong. I'll wait and see though what with it being 60 bucks
[4:02:31] <%AzureGale> Time 2 report Patron
[4:02:35] <An_Armed_Bear> @Cjjb1995 Bahamut was dealt with a long time ago
[4:02:38] <%QueequegTheater> @tacotaskforce oh you can gear wrong in XIV
[4:02:39] <%Monkeyweed21> at least kill yourself first
[4:02:41] <TheFramedWarlock> ! GIEF AT RISK !
[4:02:41] <DianaTheAscian> FF is trending
[4:02:42] <%Cjjb1995> wasn't he trapped in the moon?
[4:02:47] <%Cjjb1995> or am I misremebering?
[4:02:50] <%MaxeusTheFirst> Okay, I looked alittle bit at the DR(S). All the colors and symbols, thats what im used to. Constant confusion and just trying to heal  through it.
[4:02:53] <+TestAnon> so, any TBC'ers in chat :)
[4:02:56] <%QueequegTheater> @tacotaskforce I saw someone with cosmetic gear in Seat of Sacrifice
[4:03:02] <%Dakuu75> I thought he was the moon
[4:03:09] <An_Armed_Bear> Not this moon
[4:03:11] <%QueequegTheater> AsmonWoolie collab when Kappa
[4:03:25] <+Cn_alpha_02> Cn_alpha_02 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 28 months! 
[4:03:26] <+FingaLights> Were can i go for 1.0 lore or is it in 14 still?
[4:03:34] <%JoshManVGH> @cjjb1995 He was! Sealed and launched into space to become the moon Dallamud
[4:03:37] <tacotaskforce> @QueequegTheater that's not what I mean. in WoW you could be at a "recommended" ilevel, but you can only cast 3 heals before running out of mana
[4:03:54] <%QueequegTheater> @tacotaskforce oh, okay
[4:03:59] <%QueequegTheater> That's weird
[4:04:05] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> thats weird
[4:04:06] <%CzeekyTV> @czeekytv what I mean is gear pretty much doesn't matter in ffxiv as opposed to WoW where it can be the make or break
[4:04:12] <%Cjjb1995> @JoshManVGH and endwalker takes place on a different moon?
[4:04:41] <%QueequegTheater> @Cjjb1995 yes
[4:04:48] <%QueequegTheater> Dalamud crashed into the planet in 1.0
[4:04:51] <tacotaskforce> Dalmut was more of an asteroid. they just called it a moon because that sounds cool
[4:04:52] <+TestAnon> isn't every piece of gear in retail wow the same 4-5 stats?
[4:04:54] <%Cjjb1995> kewl ty
[4:04:55] <%QueequegTheater> And Bahamut woke up
[4:05:14] <%Monkeyweed21> @czeekytv yea gear in FF14 is basically a check of if your number is high enough whereas in WoW getting BiS gear IS the game
[4:05:14] <tacotaskforce> @TestAnon i guess, but who plays retail?
[4:05:31] <+Akizea> @tacotaskforce it was legit an artificial moon lol
[4:05:31] <%MaxeusTheFirst> @TestAnon Sometimes you get a piece of gear that adds something else like extra +5 damage or regen.
[4:05:33] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> Bahamut was trapped and his prison was placed in orbit by the Allagans (i think) and it was round so it looked like a moon
[4:05:42] <%QueequegTheater> @Cjjb1995 That event is depicted in the trailer for Realm Reborn, go to youtube and look up "FFXIV Flames of Truth"
[4:05:44] <%Monkeyweed21> also fuck Azerite and Titan Forging that shit is trash
[4:05:51] <%Puhff> @QueequegTheater not quite on bahamut, but then again apoilers
[4:06:03] <tacotaskforce> WoW has execution as well, but its based more on reading the party than sticking to the script, like ff14
[4:06:09] <%QueequegTheater> Okay but I think I got the gist
[4:06:16] <%Cjjb1995> @QueequegTheater No, I know that much, I thought he was defeated by being trapped in a moon again
[4:06:19] <ivanmistwalker> Yo! Hows Pats child?
[4:06:24] <%Cjjb1995> which apparently he wasn't
[4:06:40] <An_Armed_Bear> aw man early reviews of biomutant aren't great
[4:06:41] <%MaxeusTheFirst> @Cjjb1995 Baby is good, better than Pat expected.
[4:06:45] <tacotaskforce> Naw we blew up Bahamut's fucking heart. it was metal.
[4:06:47] <Kain5707> theres a whole raid that continues Bahamuts story and its really good
[4:06:53] <%QueequegTheater> @Cjjb1995 The answer to that is shown in the Coils Of Bahaumut raids in 2.0
[4:06:58] <%JoshManVGH> Yeah Hydaelyn (the planet) was thought to have 2 moons. one big one small. The small moon was artificial, created by the lost Allagan empire to seal the Primal Bahamut until a solution could be discovered. That moon was called down and opened to unleash Bahamut on the world. Endwalker will take place on the real moon.
[4:07:04] <%QueequegTheater> Which are available in FFXIV
[4:07:17] <%QueequegTheater> So you can find out what happened
[4:07:17] <ivanmistwalker> Thanks
[4:07:22] <Kain5707> also Coils has an amazing CG cutscene
[4:07:32] <An_Armed_Bear> I'm curious how where Anima will be put
[4:07:33] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> Which you can play through Heavensward for free
[4:07:44] <%Cjjb1995> gotcha, thanks guys
[4:07:52] <Hoodywolf> he just wanted out
[4:07:57] <%QueequegTheater> I soloed Coils in one day as RDM/WAR so by the end I was too frustrated to bother with cutscenes
[4:07:58] <An_Armed_Bear> Wonder if she'll be part of Pandemonium or something
[4:08:02] <%QueequegTheater> I need to go watch it again
[4:08:05] <trianglehat> bamboozled
[4:08:05] <Kain5707> PAT CHEST
[4:08:10] <Astrophizz> dogs are like that
[4:08:14] <Kain5707> could of been mount :)
[4:08:16] <plaguedoctor_syan> how to unlock coils? i unlock the first raid but did not do it
[4:08:20] <iosephe> what a baby
[4:08:21] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> That dandalion was talking shit, you don't know. LUL
[4:08:24] <tanarath> He's training you, Pat.
[4:08:24] <%Monkeyweed21> keep in mind the false moon Dalamud was around for thousand of years, the entire time Bahamut was fully lucid and could hear his believers being tortured
[4:08:38] <Kain5707> oh i had no idea LUL
[4:08:54] <%Cjjb1995> @Monkeyweed21 that's a yikes
[4:08:58] <%Valdorick> woaw
[4:08:59] <$Sdeje> D:
[4:09:05] <%QueequegTheater> @plaguedoctor_syan defeat the level 50 Hard trials then talk to Urianger in the Waking Sands again
[4:09:10] <%AzureGale> Talk to the fist
[4:09:11] <+MayorRev> TOS
[4:09:13] <%Mendin> Yeah that was an Infinite Misery RTeactor
[4:09:18] <ivanmistwalker> nice save
[4:09:19] <tanarath> @patstaresat In WoW, loot despawned within like 5-10 minutes.
[4:09:19] <An_Armed_Bear> Granted that's not the real Bahamut
[4:09:21] <%QueequegTheater> I think it's Ifrit, Garuda, and Titan?
[4:09:22] <%Mendin> the Allagans were up to SOME SHIT
[4:09:22] <%Valdorick> Man threatens dog with smacks on cheek
[4:09:38] <+MayorRev> Don't worry pat Alinity's still doing her thing so
[4:09:40] <Kain5707> Bahamuts had a fucked up life
[4:09:42] <plaguedoctor_syan> @QueequegTheater i remember doing that
[4:09:46] <+lucaflowe> That tempurature mechanic is really interesting
[4:09:51] <%Mendin> Yeah but Primal Bahamut was summoned by his girlfriend-sister trying to resurrect him
[4:09:54] <%Cjjb1995> @An_Armed_Bear wait wut?
[4:09:56] <tanarath> Like you, Pat.
[4:10:10] <%QueequegTheater> @plaguedoctor_syan then you either have the quest in your journal or have to go reacquire it
[4:10:21] <%Cjjb1995> there's more than 1 bahamut in 14?
[4:10:22] <%QueequegTheater> (From Uri)
[4:10:23] <%Monkeyweed21> @Monkeyweed21 Yea the Allagans figured out stuff like cloning, stasis, resurrection and immortality and used it to commit horrific war crimes
[4:10:24] <Kain5707> @Cjjb1995 :)
[4:10:25] <%Mendin> @An_Armed_Bear Primal Bahamut was a 'reincarnation' of Elder Dragon Bahamut
[4:10:29] <%Mekhet09> It feels that with the ascians reveal allagans just don't matter.
[4:10:30] <Kain5707> :)
[4:10:33] <plaguedoctor_syan> @QueequegTheater thanks
[4:10:40] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> The goo means good
[4:10:46] <An_Armed_Bear> I thought it was like Shiva where it's not REALLY Bahamut
[4:10:47] <%Movemeister> Gorsh
[4:11:04] <%Mendin> Midgarsormr - 7 elder dragons - each dragon's flight/broods
[4:11:07] <%Mekhet09> Yeah bahamut is a primal.
[4:11:13] <%QueequegTheater> Weren't you afk for half the fight
[4:11:15] <%JoshManVGH> @kain5707 To be fair, that Bahamut wasn't the real Bahamut. That one died long ago, but the certain Masked Entities pushed his family and followers to call a Primal in his image to bring about an Umbral Calamity.
[4:11:18] <%ClericOfSparda> That Dandelion was screaming "Eat me, Britain!"
[4:11:22] <%Mendin> OG Bahamut was an elder dragon but Dalamud Bahamut was a primal summoned in an attempt to revive OG Bahamut
[4:11:39] <%NopeBadguy> HE MUST SEARCH FOR HIS BALLS
[4:11:43] <%Monkeyweed21> @Cjjb1995 there was the Original Bahamut who was just an old, powerful dragon. When he died, his sister and all their followers summoned a god being version of him to fight off the Allagans
[4:11:52] <%Valdorick> He's redirecting the strength from his balls into his legs
[4:11:57] <Fefe41> The balls were just a limiter
[4:12:00] <%NopeBadguy> "ELMO DO YOU HAVE MY BALLS"
[4:12:02] <%Cjjb1995> @Monkeyweed21 BASED SISTER
[4:12:06] <%Cjjb1995> we should all be so lucky
[4:12:08] <nevan_44> not the poop!
[4:12:10] <iosephe> oh no
[4:12:10] <%pokefan9956> he eet da poopoo
[4:12:11] <Kain5707> @JoshManVGH right but he did come to Hydalin and was murdered then was summoned to kill so cant blame him
[4:12:13] <DianaTheAscian> NOOOOOOOOOO
[4:12:24] <%Mendin> @Monkeyweed21 Sister was also his girlfriend so
[4:12:24] <%JoshManVGH> So his followers were all tempered mind washed subjugated dragonkin. Still the idea of a primal being driven insane is interesting.
[4:12:25] <%cvp5127> how dare you
[4:12:31] <%pokefan9956> pat, you have to eat the poop before he does
[4:12:32] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt When my parent's dog was a puppy I made her walk two miles every day (I live in Chicago, it wasn't too hot, don't worry) and she still resents me for it but she's in fantastic shape now thanks to it
[4:12:38] <ivanmistwalker> Burger must be stopped
[4:12:39] <%QueequegTheater> *bulldog
[4:12:39] <An_Armed_Bear> How many of the First Brood have we met? 5 so far, with a 6th one showing up in Endwalker right?
[4:12:40] <%Pappajimbo> dog do love cat poop
[4:12:50] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt for the heart worm
[4:12:50] <%WhereIsWill> how can you love someone if you cant eat their poop?
[4:12:58] <%QueequegTheater> You must have more willpower than them
[4:12:59] <Kain5707> granddad midgarsomr
[4:13:00] <%Mendin> Yeah we'll have known of 6/7 by Endwalker with Vlitra
[4:13:02] <Fefe41> If technology gets to a point where they can turn your poop into legit curry would you eat it
[4:13:03] <%Monkeyweed21> @Cjjb1995 she considers it to be the greatest mistake in the history of dragon kind and willingly stays inside an Allagan torture machine until the end of time as punishment
[4:13:06] <RinWR> @Monkeyweed21 Except she got tricked into doing it, it wasn't a proper version of him, just something with his shape and power, not his soul
[4:13:11] <%NopeBadguy> do something relaxing like ocean fishing
[4:13:13] <%QueequegTheater> @WhereIsWill that's the truest expression of live
[4:13:18] <%AzureGale> ha
[4:13:18] <%Deft_Thought> Man, I am having some trouble getting the Free Trial working on Steam
[4:13:22] <%Cjjb1995> @Monkeyweed21 so she's cringe
[4:13:22] <nevan_44> LUL
[4:13:22] <Hoodywolf> it is pretty boring
[4:13:23] <plaguedoctor_syan> usually they are trying to get nutrients that the animal that pooped did not absorb
[4:13:26] <DianaTheAscian> ha
[4:13:28] <%Mekhet09> At least you aren't leveling something from 1.
[4:13:32] <%WhereIsWill> pfft LUL
[4:13:34] <%NopeBadguy> PotD 200 stream?
[4:13:36] <@CreepyPorpoise> WHY PAT
[4:13:36] <Kain5707> LUL
[4:13:40] <DianaTheAscian> wow u didn't die
[4:13:45] <plaguedoctor_syan> it more commom in pups
[4:13:46] <@CreepyPorpoise> raw buster to the face
[4:13:46] <DianaTheAscian> nevermind
[4:13:47] <@CreepyPorpoise> I can't
[4:13:48] <%JoshManVGH> Midguardsormer, Hresvalger, Niddhog, Tiamet, and Bahamut(kinda) I think are the 5 first brood featured so far.
[4:13:55] <%QueequegTheater> PotD-only stream when
[4:14:00] <%NopeBadguy> He DID just say he wanted to die
[4:14:00] <%Monkeyweed21> imagine dying in DR normal LUL
[4:14:08] <ammobasket> Got ur wish lol
[4:14:12] <+Akizea> @JoshManVGH theres a nother that was shown in the endwalker trailer
[4:14:17] <%CalderGaming> this silent hill homecoming-ass chair machine
[4:14:17] <%Mekhet09> Do savage DR? Show us how fun it can be?
[4:14:19] <%Mendin> I enjoy this warped distorted version of the Bozja Theme.
[4:14:19] <An_Armed_Bear> And Vrtra will be in Endwalker
[4:14:24] <%lucky_icarus> I just did a DR as Gunbreaker. My hands hurt and Im just fucking drained, its so boring
[4:14:26] <An_Armed_Bear> So there's one unaccounted for
[4:14:26] <%Mendin> By which I mean I never want to hear it outside of this boss fight
[4:14:27] <Kain5707> @JoshManVGH no midgar came to hydalin with a shit ton of eggs
[4:14:32] <Rei_Dsoto> Well, thank you for streaming anyway.  At least you made SOME progress to the next Relic stages.!  <3
[4:14:34] <%QueequegTheater> Sure, Pat, that's why Kappa
[4:14:35] <%JoshManVGH> Right but we haven't seen them in the game yet.
[4:14:38] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt if you get the mount will it be worth it?
[4:14:41] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt Join the Primal Forays discord if you want to try it
[4:14:41] <%Mekhet09> That sucks.
[4:14:43] <%Mendin> @JoshManVGH Ratatoskr was vored by the Ishgardians
[4:14:47] <Kain5707> midgar is pratically a god
[4:14:54] <%KineticZen> Yeah you have to schedule through Discords and whatnot unless you have a massive FC
[4:15:04] <%Cjjb1995> I mean, I'm sure you could organize something with friends/fans/other streamers if you wanted
[4:15:08] <%KineticZen> And it takes weeks of prog til you see a clear in most cases
[4:15:09] <%JoshManVGH> @kain5707 OH! He's the father, I completly forgot
[4:15:13] <DianaTheAscian> is savage dr hard or is it just longer?
[4:15:13] <$Ziegsy> its being nerfed so itll be easier to get into
[4:15:14] <%QueequegTheater> @Mendin so that means there is only one left?
[4:15:17] <%Monkeyweed21> why are FF14 dragons so into vore and incest?
[4:15:19] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> yea, you gotta sign up for DR savage, only slightly better than the Baldesian Arsenal mess last expac
[4:15:19] <%valriot> If you get the HAIR, itll be worth it cos thats like 12-20mil
[4:15:23] <snipertheladiesman> @patstaresat is it ever too late to try this game out?
[4:15:28] <Kain5707> @JoshManVGH grandpappy
[4:15:32] <%KineticZen> DRS is much more difficult and has extra bosses/mechanics
[4:15:33] <%QueequegTheater> @snipertheladiesman no
[4:15:39] <%Mendin> Yeah. An Encyclopedia Eorzea mentioned the name of the seventh of the First Brood but we know nothing baout their status
[4:15:39] <Kain5707> he a boomer
[4:15:42] <+Akizea> @snipertheladiesman never
[4:15:55] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> @DianaTheAscian DR savage is a significant step up in difficulty
[4:15:59] <Kain5707> sex chair
[4:16:00] <%transporterthesequel> PAT HEAR ME OUT. What if, big mommy queen steps on you though. Is it worth it then? It probably is.
[4:16:04] <%Zepik> don't you want a doot throne?
[4:16:07] <+BIumen> i think the allagans gave ancient bozjans stuff it's weird
[4:16:08] <rei0> doot chair
[4:16:08] <An_Armed_Bear> @snipertheladiesman This is honestly one of the best times to try, the finale to the whole story is coming in 6 months which is plenty of time to see if you like the game and want to catch up
[4:16:20] <DianaTheAscian> @qu3kl41n_the_impure_king k
[4:16:24] <%KineticZen> You have a door phase you need to split into 24s for to kill slimes/golems at the same time before you can even start DRS prog
[4:16:25] <%Mendin> Bahamut, Nidhogg, Ratatoskr - Dead. Tiamat, Hraesvelgr, Vritra - Alive
[4:16:26] <%Mekhet09> It looks like it's suppose to transform into a normal mecha
[4:16:27] <%Monkeyweed21> she's spreading her legs for you
[4:16:39] <balthazar758> PixelBob
[4:16:40] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> look at those scrub moves
[4:16:44] <Hoodywolf> lol the dancer
[4:16:45] <%JoshManVGH> I have so many jobs to grind to 70 before november....
[4:16:56] <%Mendin> Midgarsormr - The grandpappy, not part of the 7 proper
[4:16:59] <%Mekhet09> 80
[4:17:03] <An_Armed_Bear> @Mendin And Azdaja is a big ???
[4:17:04] <%KineticZen> I agree that Normal is really boring
[4:17:19] <Kain5707> LMAO
[4:17:27] <fritz_dacat> Music is good at least
[4:17:32] <%Mendin> @Mendin Exactly.
[4:17:35] <%Monkeyweed21> then do more DPS 4head
[4:17:42] <%StevorenoElcamino> Sheesh lol
[4:17:45] <%transporterthesequel> They need to let us take our big dick 530 gear into this place specifically
[4:17:46] <afronooch> DR with bad dps is hell.
[4:17:47] <+lojack69> I guess I am a special kind of wierdo who still enjoys doing prae everyday despite having every class at 80
[4:17:51] <Kain5707> play as a dps
[4:17:51] <%KineticZen> BRing Irregular and die to raidwides 4Head
[4:17:54] <%QueequegTheater> Hey look the SAM almost died
[4:17:57] <+TestAnon> this is why Peggle addon's exist
[4:18:00] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> you really get a fresh image of the average skill level and general laziness of US players
[4:18:02] <Hoodywolf> it sounds like people keep dying, which doesnt help
[4:18:11] <Kain5707> Peggle addons LUL
[4:18:16] <%Deft_Thought> I musta screwed something up. The Free Trial version of the game isn't working on Steam.
[4:18:16] <%JoshManVGH> What would the better adjustment be: faster Mechanics, or lower HP on mob?
[4:18:31] <%Mendin> DR's unique debuff kill mechanic doesn't help
[4:18:34] <%Zepik> use an irregular essence, trade your tank privilege for big deeps
[4:18:43] <%Mendin> @Deft_Thought Steam version of 14 has to go through steam and not the ff14 website
[4:18:44] <DianaTheAscian> no
[4:18:44] <+Qexec> LUL
[4:18:49] <%Mendin> It's a big weird fucky
[4:18:59] <@Velyndra> if you want it to go faster then go on dps 4Head
[4:19:07] <Kain5707> more than 20 are probably not
[4:19:09] <%QueequegTheater> 24
[4:19:11] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> TRUTH
[4:19:12] <%QueequegTheater> Not 48
[4:19:13] <%KineticZen> DR Normal is 24, with 48 it'd be bearable
[4:19:14] <DianaTheAscian> The boredom is causing errors now
[4:19:16] <%Agami23> i've been playing healer so at least i can experience something less than nothing. DPS and tank are so dull here.
[4:19:19] <%QueequegTheater> 48 is DRS
[4:19:19] <@Velyndra> also this is only 24
[4:19:20] <Kain5707> your party is the only ones
[4:19:20] <%Deft_Thought> @Mendin I tried that and then it told me I needed a Registration Number or it wouldn't work
[4:19:34] <Elysium_RP> Are "essences" consumables?
[4:19:35] <%kyh9> Pat, you gonna watch the Dragon Quest stream on Wednesday?
[4:19:43] <%Deft_Thought> So I went to the website and must've registered my account for the non-Steam Windows version
[4:19:44] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt also when you get a whole group of healers sucks
[4:19:47] <%Deft_Thought> Or something
[4:19:48] <Kain5707> you get a shit ton
[4:19:48] <@CreepyPorpoise> :C
[4:19:49] <jojojingle7> Hey pat don‚Äôt know if you said but what stats did you boost on the tank weapons
[4:19:57] <%TheYellowcouch> I really really fogrot how boring DR was
[4:20:00] <Hoodywolf> dont forget to go back and get that chest
[4:20:01] <%Mendin> @Elysium_RP Yes but they last until you leave Bosja, they dont expire on death or an arbitraty time limit
[4:20:02] <+BIumen> sorry nothing
[4:20:08] <%CzeekyTV> @DianaTheAscian Yeah but Aetherweaver tho :D
[4:20:09] <%QueequegTheater> @jojojingle7 Crit hit
[4:20:10] <Hoodywolf> woops too late
[4:20:10] <%Mekhet09> Seriously?
[4:20:10] <+BIumen> yeah lmao
[4:20:11] <Kain5707> literally useless
[4:20:11] <%TheYellowcouch> Boy are the not
[4:20:13] <@Velyndra> they're good for stuff
[4:20:14] <%QueequegTheater> Always crit hit
[4:20:15] <@Velyndra> just not stuff you want
[4:20:15] <%LailahQueenx> too late rip chest
[4:20:17] <%CalderGaming> yup just save em up and convert to gold
[4:20:20] <%JoshManVGH> WhT?
[4:20:20] <@JustinianKnight> you use em for gear
[4:20:20] <@Velyndra> pat pls
[4:20:21] <%KineticZen> Yeah you need 100 for a gold coin
[4:20:24] <%StevorenoElcamino> Lmao
[4:20:26] <%JoshManVGH> Then why?
[4:20:28] <%valriot> @PatStaresAt Ive done 80+ runs and NEVER got the mount or hair
[4:20:30] <DianaTheAscian> YEAH THAT ALSO SUCKS
[4:20:31] <+BIumen> 100 for 1 gold
[4:20:31] <%Agami23> if they lowered the trade rate to gold to 50 silver for one gold i'd care about silver
[4:20:36] <+lojack69> I never eat food unless im in actually hard content, because using consumables gives me  real anxiety
[4:20:36] <Daniel_Is_I> The fact that you HAVE to run DRS to get the dyeable judge gear is bullshit.
[4:20:39] <TheGammaBear> You just exchange them for gold
[4:20:43] <%QueequegTheater> Doesn't augmenting Law's Order require DRS
[4:20:45] <@JustinianKnight> they will prob add stuff tomorrow too
[4:20:50] <+BIumen> you sell your sell
[4:20:52] <%SShen> SShen subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 39 months, currently on a 39 month streak! Finally got my DRS doggo, just a day before it gets much easier to do
[4:20:55] <+lojack69> I don't doubt using essences feels the same way
[4:20:57] <@Velyndra> yeah just like savage
[4:20:58] <%TheYellowcouch> It really is ridiculous
[4:20:58] <%KineticZen> Not necessarily
[4:20:58] <%QueequegTheater> Holy shit
[4:20:59] <bgmike_ex> Maybe they'll let us buy augment items with gold in the patch
[4:21:02] <%QueequegTheater> Fuck that
[4:21:04] <%NopeBadguy> Not clears. Each boss drops a piece
[4:21:05] <+BIumen> @PatStaresAt don't forget the dyable judge gear requires augmented normal bozja gear
[4:21:06] <%Mekhet09> That's not fair.
[4:21:06] <%Mendin> Frankly I want to turn Silvers into Normals so I can get my augmented base bozja
[4:21:07] <$DeeJayOkay> the price for Fashion Souls
[4:21:10] <Kain5707> tomorrow is FF12 gear
[4:21:10] <nevan_44> oh god ew
[4:21:12] <%TheYellowcouch> Like you need fully upgraded everything to get one that's not that good
[4:21:13] <DianaTheAscian> fuck that
[4:21:21] <Kain5707> main character gear
[4:21:26] <Daniel_Is_I> All that for haste that nobody wants because it fucks up your rotation.
[4:21:28] <ValkahRoctsteel> Dont forget the fully augmented bozja gear too
[4:21:32] <DianaTheAscian> FUCK THAT
[4:21:34] <+BIumen> so if you like og bozja stuff fuck you buy extras
[4:21:35] <jojojingle7> @patstaresat what stats did you boost on your tank relics
[4:21:35] <afronooch> super not worth
[4:21:42] <ivanmistwalker> RIP
[4:21:47] <%Mekhet09> It's not even worth it either.
[4:21:49] <%SShen> You can also get the full upgrade from the DRS bosses too
[4:21:49] <%JoshManVGH> Jesus
[4:21:51] <%QueequegTheater> I'm not even going to bother
[4:21:56] <%QueequegTheater> @jojojingle7 critical hit
[4:21:57] <ValkahRoctsteel> Never getting that dyeable judge armour
[4:22:00] <%BoxNavy> moon2W
[4:22:03] <%weissguard> GIB Judge psaGib
[4:22:03] <Kain5707> its just good for glamour and side jobs
[4:22:07] <Daniel_Is_I> The Eureka gear is easier and that's already a grind
[4:22:08] <%WhereIsWill> just get judge armor for glam and thats it
[4:22:09] <%KineticZen> One type of plating drops from each boss/encounter in DRS
[4:22:15] <%kyh9> Looks cool
[4:22:16] <%KineticZen> You also have a chance for a full aug to drop
[4:22:18] <%Mekhet09> What does the casting set look like?
[4:22:19] <jojojingle7> @queequegtheater ty
[4:22:25] <%KineticZen> So it does require a lot of work
[4:22:28] <Daniel_Is_I> It's not months of grinding good
[4:22:29] <Hoodywolf> its not very good, which sucks as a healer
[4:22:33] <%Mekhet09> That's always the case.
[4:22:33] <%Agami23> oh, i like the healing gear.
[4:22:36] <Notsocleveruser> Objectively wrong
[4:22:37] <%QueequegTheater> @jojojingle7 crit is ALWAYS the best skill to boost
[4:22:40] <%KineticZen> A clear gets you a random full aug as well
[4:22:41] <%Mekhet09> I remember eden gear looking awful.
[4:22:43] <Daniel_Is_I> It requires more grinding than a whole-ass relic weapon
[4:22:44] <Srthunda> thats cool tho
[4:22:45] <+BIumen> the judge stuff doesnt translate super well
[4:22:46] <@JustinianKnight> scouting the best imo
[4:22:47] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> pat wrong
[4:22:48] <%SShen> queen will always drop a full upgrade box too
[4:22:50] <jojojingle7> Do you know what wa second
[4:22:51] <Hoodywolf> forget it if you're hroth lol
[4:22:51] <WakeUpThrow> I think it looks quite nice
[4:22:52] <TootPirate> I like the healer gear tho
[4:22:55] <Kain5707> always Crit/Det
[4:22:55] <doggieo> Did you see the new armors?
[4:22:56] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> ...why couldn't the casting and healing gear have capes?
[4:23:04] <acexclover> whats all this?
[4:23:04] <%TheYellowcouch> I swear i we'll need to get all of them upgraded to get the third set dyabel
[4:23:05] <%Agami23> the back of your legs absolutely clips through those ruffles
[4:23:07] <%TheYellowcouch> I will shit
[4:23:10] <%Deft_Thought> This PC account system for 14 is really awkward
[4:23:10] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> the new Zadnor gear looks so lame
[4:23:10] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt The Bozja healing gear is the best Healing glam in like two expansions
[4:23:13] <%Mekhet09> Extend the grind.
[4:23:15] <%TheYellowcouch> I want that top  for a jill cosplay so bad
[4:23:17] <%Valdorick> Work for your Trashmog
[4:23:25] <@Velyndra> if the dyable version wasn't in savage theres no reason to do it
[4:23:28] <@JustinianKnight> youre welcome
[4:23:28] <Daniel_Is_I> Get ready for the next zone's gear to require upgraded Judge gear.
[4:23:30] <%Agami23> also the augmented gear gives you a passive boost to DR and bozja content
[4:23:31] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt give me your coins instead
[4:23:36] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt its also dyeable right off the bat
[4:23:39] <%JoshManVGH> Artificial content expansion?
[4:23:39] <%Rumbutt> Just spam 51-60 of Palace till you get that last timeworn
[4:23:45] <%transporterthesequel> Literally because people complained about it being too easy
[4:23:47] <jojojingle7> I love the healer resistance armor
[4:23:48] <Grimdogx> Cosmetic grind is always fun
[4:23:49] <penitentpendant> I sort of hope with 5.55 they make it so you can buy the augment stuff for judge armor with gold coins
[4:23:51] <%Rumbutt> better than DR
[4:23:53] <Daniel_Is_I> @Velyndra People did BA even though you could dye the Elemental gear
[4:23:55] <%Mekhet09> @QueequegTheater Healing gear looks bad 80% of the time you get used to it.
[4:23:57] <%KineticZen> "I'm not owned" I say as I prepare to grind Dalriada Savage for 3 months for the next aug set
[4:23:57] <+snausages_> yea but there's also doing savage just for the challenge and gitting gud
[4:24:05] <%KineticZen> If there's even a Savage version
[4:24:09] <%QueequegTheater> @Rumbutt it's actually faster to run 51-100
[4:24:11] <+snausages_> oh deleberum savage
[4:24:14] <@Velyndra> its not 10 clears 100%
[4:24:18] <@CreepyPorpoise> The Pagl'than healer gear is the first healer stuff I've liked in a LONG time
[4:24:19] <%QueequegTheater> deeper floors give better odds
[4:24:19] <%BoxNavy> moon2W
[4:24:20] <@Velyndra> you get a chest at the end that is one free one
[4:24:24] <ValkahRoctsteel> Doing DRS is not worth it just for the dyeable armour.
[4:24:25] <@Velyndra> and its 1 per boss kill
[4:24:28] <@SpaceCapnCrone> o7
[4:24:37] <@JustinianKnight> justin92NoxusFace
[4:24:39] <jojojingle7> How bad is the savage I haven‚Äôt done it
[4:24:44] <TheGammaBear> Hi
[4:24:44] <%QueequegTheater> @CreepyPorpoise my femroe's skin is too pale to see the tattoos Sadge
[4:24:44] <@SpaceCapnCrone> (Strident and Gamma)
[4:24:46] <%Agami23> did you say porpoise?
[4:24:46] <%TheYellowcouch> don't forget your friends
[4:24:48] <%BoxNavy> and thank YOU chat :)
[4:24:49] <%KineticZen> Also your duelist has to not fuck the dog to get hand plating/aug drops
[4:24:50] <ValkahRoctsteel> Hope the new gear is dyeable from the get go
[4:24:50] <@JustinianKnight> strident and gamma
[4:24:51] <%JoshManVGH> Creepy?
[4:24:54] <@CreepyPorpoise> wow
[4:25:02] <+snausages_> savage anything is mostly about finding good ppl tbh
[4:25:04] <Kain5707> rip Creepy
[4:25:04] <%KineticZen> or is that head I don't even remember
[4:25:06] <%QueequegTheater> LUL
[4:25:13] <%king_wragles> More like Thankless Porpoise
[4:25:16] <TheGammaBear> Can't blame him, I disappear for years at a time
[4:25:24] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Rip Porpise
[4:25:34] <%JoshManVGH> Someone's gonna get locked out of the FC house.
[4:25:36] <@CreepyPorpoise> You all recognize me, and thats enough ;w;
[4:25:43] <aqua_mashu> yup
[4:25:48] <@CreepyPorpoise> But also Pat will be getting a letter from my lawyers later.
[4:25:49] <+Dosudude> After like 5 buffs to drops
[4:25:53] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> the Zadnor gear is lame FF12 gear
[4:25:54] <Daniel_Is_I> I hope the Zadnor stuff is more like Hydatos
[4:25:54] <Hoodywolf> I dont wan to wait for it to pop up though...
[4:25:57] <Kain5707> you will
[4:25:59] <%kyh9> HEY
[4:25:59] <%BoxNavy> does anyone know if you have to finish the bozja story stuff before you get into zadnor
[4:26:00] <Kain5707> for sure
[4:26:02] <%kyh9> I LIKE JUDGE ARMORS
[4:26:02] <%SShen> Castrum needed buffs to be worth running though
[4:26:02] <nevan_44> ITS SO UGLY LUL
[4:26:04] <Hoodywolf> hopefully its queue-able like dr
[4:26:05] <Daniel_Is_I> GIVE ME EUREKA BUNNIES IN ZADNOR
[4:26:05] <Dalthine> I have always hated Penelo -solely- for her outfit.
[4:26:05] <%QueequegTheater> @CreepyPorpoise Don't worry, chat sees you hard carrying Pat through the streams
[4:26:06] <%weissguard> creepy49Porpkek creepy49Porpkek creepy49Porpkek
[4:26:07] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt well castrum now is good but when it dropped...oh boy
[4:26:07] <iosephe> castrum rewards, speed, and not that queuing mechanism
[4:26:08] <%Monkeyweed21> I cant believe Porp kicked Pat out of the FC
[4:26:09] <%kyh9> ESPECIALLY WHEN ITS UGLY
[4:26:15] <@CreepyPorpoise> creepy49Porpkek

[4:32:48] <%QueequegTheater> I mean, I got one of each role + DRK to 80 in the same time but Jesus
[4:32:54] <%BoxNavy> people who have every job at 80 are inhuman

[4:34:21] <%Dakuu75> DBD suppose to get an RE monster, right?
[4:34:26] <Kain5707> thats fucking insane but if you had all 70s its not that crazy
[4:34:28] <+OnyxMemory> I think its funny that Square says parsers are bad but then makes fights with super tight dps checks that the Stone Sea Sky dummies dont accurately reflect if you can do them.
[4:34:28] <%cvp5127> would they ever bring dqx to the west
