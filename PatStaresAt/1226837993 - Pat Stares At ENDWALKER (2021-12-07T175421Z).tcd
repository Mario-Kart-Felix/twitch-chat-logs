[0:02:42] <%Mendin> Mendin subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 19 months! the final early-access days were upon us, the fabric of the datacenters began to fray
[0:03:30] <Jakeawienas> u know fishing while hellfire rains down on Thavnair is actually pretty relaxing
[0:03:32] <+fugatlas> hey there , just joined. What level content are we at rn
[0:03:58] <Mildly_Eccentric> ayo im endwalkin here
[0:04:06] <%X2Eliah> X2Eliah subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months! Hey Pat. Why is your FF14 character becoming more and more of a furry every day? First the ears, then the bishi, now a complete hedgehog...
[0:04:10] <+Havictos> Been trying to get that Crimson Lotus scythe it's not going well
[0:04:18] <%X2Eliah> @fugatlas 85-ish
[0:04:18] <+transporterthesequel> Pat: "Gonna go live at 1pm(Goes live at NINE AM)"
[0:04:45] <%X2Eliah> well its 1pm in his weird canadian time
[0:04:47] <+fugatlas> I mean its one pm eastern rn
[0:04:55] <+Havictos> Hey his Male viera actually looks pretty cool.
[0:04:58] <%Truniron> Truniron subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 22 months, currently on a 11 month streak! 
[0:05:25] <%X2Eliah> @Havictos yes. very edge.
[0:05:28] <+fugatlas> shadow the hedgehog has never NOT been a cool aesthetic, the cringe just always overtook the cool
[0:05:34] <+fugatlas> it is up to Pat to be based and not cringe
[0:06:04] <%chance_h> Pat, Pog
[0:06:05] <+transporterthesequel> I forgot about Canada and it's powerful time vortex
[0:06:25] <+Havictos> What caused red and black to be cringey edgelord colors who's responsible for that?
[0:06:40] <Jackalope322> this is gonna be such a good stream
[0:06:52] <%chance_h> By being 1 hour ahead, the fake French have managed to survive
[0:06:56] <Jakeawienas> all the shadow the hedgehog haters
[0:07:01] <Daniel_Is_I> This is gonna be REALLY good
[0:07:08] <whispersilk001> @Havictos Shadow The Hedgehog
[0:07:22] <%zyberion626> where did Pat leave off last night?
[0:07:31] <RushUnplugged> Shadow has ruined cool shit for everybody
[0:07:37] <RushUnplugged> it's all your fault, Sonic fans
[0:07:42] <+Cityscape17> idk whats happening lol
[0:07:50] <+Cityscape17> ive been gone for so long
[0:08:18] <%chance_h> Blame Chaos
[0:08:27] <+Havictos> @Cityscape17 Long story short uh shit's the worst it's ever been
[0:08:30] <%X2Eliah> Well it's either shadown the hedgehog, or ferrari, that ruined red+black aesthetic
[0:08:36] <fanciful_fright> dunno how to not spoil where pat is, so I'm just gonna say he's nearly at the cool part
[0:08:41] <+transporterthesequel> I mean...I'm pretty sure Shadow is lower on the totem pole than NAZI'S
[0:08:56] <+Cityscape17> @Havictos Sounds like a good time then. :D
[0:09:04] <+transporterthesequel> They...are kinda the ones that ruined red and black as a color choice.
[0:09:31] <+Havictos> and an entire style of mustache
[0:09:32] <RushUnplugged> @transporterthesequel holyshit what a jump to Godwin's Law
[0:09:35] <%YakumoYomi> @transporterthesequel True. We can't even enjoy the manji anymore without people automatically seeing a Swastika
[0:09:45] <%X2Eliah> @transporterthesequel yeah
[0:10:06] <%X2Eliah> and shadow the hedgehog *still*went with it
[0:10:23] <+transporterthesequel> HA, true
[0:10:31] <+Cityscape17> ive been in the bahamas for the last week, so the world is a blur to me right now lol
[0:10:35] <fanciful_fright> god, I finished Endwalker like, 4 hours ago and that shit makes Shadowbringers feel like Stormblood.
[0:10:45] <%SuckerPunchSyd> End walker tiiiiime lets goooo!
[0:10:46] <%Buttlo> atpDance
[0:10:46] <%cobalt_phoenix_> is it my internet or has twitch been worse with lagging and audio distortion
[0:10:48] <haisho> I don't even know why I try to level my Reaper in Bozja
[0:11:04] <%X2Eliah> @Cityscape17 I was gonna ask, *where in thehell* is it 9 am now?
[0:11:05] <%Birdigalore> @zyberion626 He just finished the second part of Radz-at-han
[0:11:10] <+transporterthesequel> Powering through Endwalker is the same as the Bahamas right?
[0:11:16] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Is it that bad @haisho ?
[0:11:19] <%X2Eliah> @cobalt_phoenix_ nah just you.
[0:11:22] <+Havictos> @haisho Technically it's the most efficient but for me it wasn't very fun
[0:11:23] <haisho> oh yeah
[0:11:26] <AthenaAegis> PatDril: "I'm not furry! I say as I turn into a bun boy." Kappa
[0:11:33] <%SuckerPunchSyd> 😔
[0:11:34] <%X2Eliah> @cobalt_phoenix_ try reloading page, if no luck, drop down a resolution level
[0:11:42] <haisho> every instance I go into it's just legions of Reapers dying en mass in Critical Engagements
[0:11:43] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @cobalt_phoenix_ well damn, thanks still
[0:12:19] <fanciful_fright> @haisho bozja leveling is only worth it if you have all the speed maps and the whole map unlocked. Don't even bother with Critical engagements, just stick with the skirmishes
[0:12:23] <+Cityscape17> its still 106 in the bahamas right now XD
[0:12:29] <+Cityscape17> east coast time
[0:12:35] <%Kevlar_Caviar> the last time i played xiv i decided i was going to switch from warrior to one of the mages, but then i realized how long it would take me to get back to where my warrior was so i think once the servers are back to normal i might just go back to warrior LUL
[0:12:41] <+Havictos> @haisho I bailed outta there as fast as I could once I got my Final relic katana before endwalker even came out
[0:12:48] <%NitronStreams> LETS GOOOOOOOOOOO
[0:12:55] <haisho> I think the real problem is that barely anyone does Zadnor Z1 and Z2 anymore
[0:13:01] <PainterOfMiniatures> Wait, is this the opening for every stream?
[0:13:04] <%shurtal> God I hope I get tonight before pat catches up
[0:13:11] <+Havictos> @Kevlar_Caviar With the stuff they got in endwalker WAR is borderline immortal now
[0:13:12] <%X2Eliah> @PainterOfMiniatures yes
[0:13:19] <+transporterthesequel> If there's any mods awake...I...kindly suggest emote only for...things. Not a must, but...just in case.
[0:13:35] <haisho> everyone is at Z3 while I'm desperately trying to claw my way up
[0:13:37] <~PatStaresAt> I'm a mod lel
[0:13:41] <JetpackMcQuack> BibleThump
[0:13:46] <%X2Eliah> .. is there a sonic emote?
[0:13:53] <+transporterthesequel> HA
[0:13:54] <tanithmagnus> wah
[0:13:56] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> I no life'd the story so I can freely watch the streams now yay
[0:13:58] <%retrohazard> @PatStaresAt how can you be so sure
[0:14:00] <fanciful_fright> Bozja proper is faster for exp than Zadnor anyways... assuming you can even show up before the skirmish ends

[0:15:20] <+Figleafplays> pog
[0:15:22] <Sunstalker> Welcome back to Pat's live is FFXIV
[0:15:24] <%kid_flashionable> Yeah, so many good emotes to use during that time!
[0:15:26] <+Havictos> Elmo!
[0:15:28] <profligateex> you betrayed the big strong man life s m h
[0:15:28] <%Cityscape17> Cityscape17 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! Early morning for those who just woke up
[0:15:29] <Eger007> a lot of crazy shit easily spoilerable
[0:15:34] <forumbug74> early morning my ass
[0:15:35] <Jakeawienas> you should put it in sub only but give me a sub first :)
[0:15:39] <haisho> oh yeah they're diverting their DEV SERVERS of all things
[0:15:39] <profligateex> I want this twink destroyed
[0:15:43] <%kid_flashionable> such as psaGib and psaGiefrail
[0:15:44] <%chance_h> psaBlep
[0:15:45] <fanciful_fright> honestly, emote only is prolly good idea for like, the next 60 hours of game
[0:15:53] <@Velyndra> i shall now hack into the database and turn on mod mode
[0:15:55] <@Velyndra> so much power
[0:15:55] <%Birdigalore> I just got booted, hopped back in to a queue of 483 so maybe things are looking better
[0:15:57] <RubyPilot> i want that cat pet
[0:15:59] <RubyPilot> pet that cat
[0:16:06] <+Figleafplays> also FREE GAME TIME alright!
[0:16:08] <+Havictos> @haisho Creative Business Unit 3 are a company of heroes
[0:16:23] <%JoshManVGH> I WILL NOT STOP
[0:16:28] <+transporterthesequel> As a NIGHTMARE BINGER I RESEMBLE THAT STATEMENT
[0:16:29] <Sunstalker> Amazon could probably earn more money if they shut down New World for nwo and rented out their servers to FF LUL
[0:16:29] <Eger007> what was que today?
[0:16:32] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Hack the plant @Velyndra
[0:16:33] <fanciful_fright> *sweats in nightmare binge*
[0:16:38] <%lucky_icarus> I had early access so Im now free to no longer nightmare binge....
[0:16:40] <+Figleafplays> half my fc has already finished
[0:16:45] <+JustToWatch> @PatStaresAt ok but did you hear that Tesla drivers can now play video games on their infotainment system WHILE DRIVING. Also Ubisoft is selling NFTs but you probably saw that already
[0:16:46] <%VictorVonLouche> And you get up early to get in FINE thats really nice lol
[0:16:47] <Kan0li> i wont notice a free week KEKW
[0:16:50] <%Birdigalore> Can't stop the binge cuz I gotta lvl all my crafters a jobs and job hunt for that doggo!
[0:16:57] <%RealThiele> 7 days woo
[0:16:58] <%X2Eliah> @Sunstalker is New World even alive anymore?
[0:16:58] <%chance_h> I just binged Hades on my 1 day off lol
[0:17:00] <JetpackMcQuack> at least they didn't steal
[0:17:01] <+Figleafplays> just means they care, you know @PatStaresAt
[0:17:02] <+JustToWatch> good on my end
[0:17:20] <+transporterthesequel> It is!
[0:17:24] <+Figleafplays> that is a very edge bun
[0:17:25] <+Havictos> @X2Eliah It's still around unfortunately
[0:17:29] <haisho> I do like that combo
[0:17:29] <bigstupidjellyfish1337> Shadow the twink hog
[0:17:29] <Ladybugdance> the story was really good but i think the graphic love making scene with luffy and noruto was going a little too far
[0:17:30] <%SaiyanShoto> I don’t see it
[0:17:30] <%lucky_icarus> Black and gold is a better combo
[0:17:30] <+the22cstomp> fuck the haters, red and black is good combo
[0:17:34] <+fugatlas> pat, the master of edge
[0:17:35] <+SeventhVice> Purple and Black is better tho
[0:17:36] <%Agami23> black and purple is better
[0:17:36] <%FunkyStreams> equip bunny ears?
[0:17:38] <%barrakuta371> I like orange and black
[0:17:39] <%cappyd33> yeah black and red is the best color combo
[0:17:43] <%RealThiele> mpreg the edgehog
[0:17:43] <tanithmagnus> Shadow the murder twink
[0:17:47] <JetpackMcQuack> the edge is abrasive 8)
[0:17:55] <+transporterthesequel> I have that fantasia
[0:17:57] <%kyh9> Ow the Edge
[0:17:57] <+Havictos> I actually love Black and Blue
[0:17:58] <+Figleafplays> paige would choose red and yellow
[0:17:59] <@Velyndra> i'll make paige a glamour that turns her into a mustard bottle
[0:17:59] <Mildly_Eccentric> Youre not even good enough to be my fake.
[0:18:06] <haisho> aged brass?
[0:18:09] <%barrakuta371> copper and black is nice too
[0:18:14] <fanciful_fright> black with glowy blue accents is the ultimate combo
[0:18:20] <MaybeFalco> edgehog makes me chuckle harder than it should
[0:18:21] <%lucky_icarus> The lvl 89 gnb gear is the perfect black gold ratio
[0:18:24] <Daniel_Is_I> CAN'T IT?
[0:18:36] <JetpackMcQuack> we gonna find out
[0:18:38] <+FutaSnek> psycos
[0:18:40] <%afronooch> the people that couldnt shift their pto perfectly
[0:18:43] <%X2Eliah> Tell Paige t6hat food with gold bits in is will get outlawed real soon. ("edible gold" is no longer good)
[0:18:48] <%SuckerPunchSyd> @velyndra PogChamp that sounds awesome

[0:19:08] <MaybeFalco> especially when you could have played for literally free during early access
[0:19:11] <%chance_h> twice the ears, double the oWo
[0:19:12] <%FunkyStreams> ultra hearing

[0:45:20] <%SuckerPunchSyd> They all seem pretty determined enough though yeah they should know
[0:45:31] <RushUnplugged> @Daniel_Is_I not yet, but if the Source goes to hell, all the other worlds do too
[0:45:33] <karl_rex> Shouldn't shards of Zodiark still exist on the shards
[0:45:34] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> the final days /could/ be in the first just... in the middle of nowhere
[0:45:34] <%ClericOfSparda> You should really do something about your inventory
[0:45:35] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Daniel_Is_I yes and no. they don't have the whole burning sky and depression monsters, but if the source dies they do too

[0:47:05] <+Havictos> @the22cstomp His gil and retainers aren't maxed he can always have more
[0:47:05] <%SuckerPunchSyd> It all got spent on... other stuff for crafting
[0:47:07] <+the22cstomp> i am constantly under 1 million it's a lot of gil
[0:47:07] <xxshadowxx416> gil does not matter
[0:47:08] <%cobalt_phoenix_> im barely at 6 lmao
[0:47:10] <penitentpendant> He's at landed gentry money
[0:47:10] <MrNoobMcSalt> OH MAN, just got here and I'm so glad I get to see this part
[0:47:11] <%lucky_icarus> I have a measly 1mil but I'm not a crafter so yeah
[0:47:14] <%chance_h> max gil x10 is normal for crafters because everything is crazy inflated
[0:47:16] <+R_BChe> i heard day 1 raiding gear is like 50 million gill?
[0:47:18] <karl_rex> 1 Mil is like a really nice mog weapon that just got released
[0:47:23] <+SpaceHobo55> just be one of those crazies who needs max level crafter gear day 1
[0:47:25] <%Mendin> Freaking Crit Materia 9s adn 10s are like 150k+ apiece as of last night
[0:47:26] <+brandonsbetow> especially harder now that cofee biscuits are nerfed
[0:47:30] <%LaughingCatt> some people seem to not realize that for most players in this game, 1 million gil is a LOT of money
[0:47:30] <+Kyma1020> Paige should probably not be here when you enter the new zone. It's Giga Spoilers

[1:17:11] <%RealThiele> the extra npc dialogue here is very worth doing too
[1:17:11] <+Twistedlink07> honestly, I can't believe they released the robe as gear in 6.0 and not 6.1 or something. its hella spoilery
[1:17:13] <+Havictos> kick it's ass

[1:18:11] <%NitronStreams> Broyour getting your ass kicked by a butterfly
[1:18:12] <%zyberion626> you go to a botanical garden and start stomping butterflies
[1:18:12] <xerioes> there are a few notes that are remeniscant of the start of a rent song in this area
[1:18:15] <%SuckerPunchSyd> “what the fuck are you doing”

[1:35:14] <%Alazull> ...Maybe...
[1:35:14] <Yakobro> @transporterthesequel tiny spoilrs for like 10min time but yueah she mainly talks via telepathy sort of, but is encouraged to talk normally
[1:35:15] <%Frranky> Don't think about it
[1:35:16] <+Tizona824> Maybe
[1:35:18] <%cobalt_phoenix_> don't worry about it
[1:35:19] <%JoshManVGH> That's... a good question
[1:35:21] <KatabolicRage> I mean, your dooting your horn
[1:35:21] <+mortalitas87> dont worry about it
[1:35:22] <+Kyma1020> uhhhhhh
[1:35:23] <%DashXero> @Nekros4442 Thanks! I think I understand.
[1:35:24] <%Alazull> ...Keep going
[1:35:24] <+transporterthesequel> AND WE HAVE THEM AS CONCEPTS
[1:35:24] <%SuckerPunchSyd> ?

[1:35:49] <Daxalog> Theyre probably always with you
[1:35:51] <+Animeweed> maybe some mounts but not all?
[1:35:54] <+Austin_QED> The real question, what is Fray/Esteem, they were explicitly stated to NOT be you
[1:35:58] <karl_rex> Since they're viewed as possessions they are able to travel across the rift and time along with their owner
[1:36:02] <Edible_Enthusiasm> Doggie

[1:38:29] <%GallowsDrop> Wow the Amaro was so much better
[1:38:34] <%LouieRouie> Gives the Namazu something to stand on
[1:38:35] <Ids560> a little sad they went back to hats
[1:38:40] <chaosking8000> well at least people won`t feel forced to go all 90, with no mount for it
[1:38:47] <SaltyAzteca> OOF
[1:38:48] <Daniel_Is_I> Boy he's a goober
[1:38:50] <%UvBenServed> LUL
[1:38:50] <haisho> what a dork
[1:38:51] <WaifusSansFrontieres> I think it sucks so people dont feel fomo over it
[1:38:55] <WaifusSansFrontieres> amaro was too cool
[1:38:58] <Eger007> he a goof
[1:39:00] <%Mendin> I want. That doggo.
[1:39:01] <peachyprimrose> What a big dumb baby idiot
[1:39:09] <%RealThiele> im glad its not another mount tbh
[1:39:11] <MillaMoks> Hermes is suck a dork
[1:39:25] <%GallowsDrop> This fucking goober becomes the fucking Fandaniel we know now
[1:39:32] <peachyprimrose> GOD They're so cute
[1:39:37] <StarMechV> BABY
[1:39:39] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> fucking cute
[1:39:39] <Edible_Enthusiasm> I thought it might've been eatten by a bird
[1:39:40] <%watts121> this fuckin spaz
[1:39:44] <%Kevlar_Caviar> seeing this dude act like a regular person and not a shitty little fuck is so weird lmao
[1:39:45] <%Reilata> LUL
[1:39:55] <gespenst25> lol what a nerd
[1:39:57] <MKII> Hermes is big himbo
[1:40:02] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Oh my god what a dork
[1:40:07] <haisho> ...yeah he's the bumbling researcher
[1:40:16] <+MelodyMedley> What a goofball
[1:40:27] <chaosking8000> how does this guy turn into fandaniel
[1:40:29] <+Kyma1020> Pay attention to the quest names Pat
[1:40:40] <heartlesshealer> oh wow pat made it in on time. How far in are you after where you ended yesterday?
[1:40:41] <+zaiatone> So Hermes specialised in Winged creatures and the Allagans made the Ixal
[1:40:46] <InXplotch> Aw I missed pat's first encounter with this zone
[1:40:57] <+Tizona824> The Fandaniel we saw was more Amon than Hermes
[1:41:01] <+Havictos> @chaosking8000 By having his soul split into pieces over 12,000 years
[1:41:09] <%Kevlar_Caviar> like... THIS dude is the one who releases zodiark? if we hadn't seen his future self do just that 2 streams ago i'd hardly believe it LUL
[1:41:09] <Daniel_Is_I> Talk to the axolotl again
[1:41:17] <+MelodyMedley> This is a nice zone
[1:41:52] <Edible_Enthusiasm> very pretty place
[1:41:55] <%tortugatime214> @patstaresat I’ve been tuning in here and there, and every time I haven’t seen any combat
[1:41:56] <InXplotch> well I mean it was more amon than hermes, wasn't it?
[1:41:57] <karl_rex> wonder what the vendor has
[1:42:03] <Overhaul180> Speaks to the quality of the writing that they can be like "Hey the big evil boss from this ten-year story is the 83 trial" and they make.  It.  Fucking.  Work.
[1:42:07] <%GallowsDrop> everything about this zone is just great
[1:42:07] <InXplotch> amon is a huge dick
[1:42:09] <haisho> too huge to target
[1:42:10] <jorniev> this dude would hate the clown he turns into
[1:42:13] <%VictorVonLouche> time to glam it up
[1:42:17] <%DashXero> Why is this place giving me Bergenworth vibes?
[1:42:29] <%RealThiele> time travel complete
[1:42:34] <heartlesshealer> it's the robes
[1:42:43] <KnivesEve> damnit I missed pat reaction
[1:42:45] <WaifusSansFrontieres> @jorniev fandaniel did say that post trial "the man I was would weep for what I have become"
[1:42:50] <Longlius> ARF
[1:42:51] <+Tizona824> @dashxero I mean, it is a research facility
[1:42:51] <%watts121> good guy pat not spiling
[1:42:52] <%DashXero> Yeah. Probably the robes.
[1:42:53] <%watts121> spoiling*
[1:42:57] <InXplotch> can you imagine seeing someone in a random zone walk through with those robes?
[1:43:09] <%solracc25> back to apocalypse
[1:43:14] <Yakobro> LUL
[1:43:14] <karl_rex> only 2 prisms?
[1:43:15] <%DashXero> @Tizona824 That too.
[1:43:17] <+MelodyMedley> No time travelling here
[1:43:21] <haisho> LUL
[1:43:25] <InXplotch> market board
[1:43:27] <+Tizona824> @inxplotch To be fair, the robes lack context until you see Amarout
[1:43:27] <InXplotch> they're cheap
[1:43:28] <jorniev> I wouldn't want to be fandaniel either
[1:43:29] <Longlius> pat how are you so poor... down to your last prism
[1:43:29] <heartlesshealer> time for glams
[1:43:31] <Daniel_Is_I> Grand Company dudes
[1:43:31] <%walternatorz> I felt a tremendous amount of anxiety having worn the glam and changing jobs when I left the zone
[1:43:32] <%watts121> Grand Company
[1:43:33] <karl_rex> buy or craft
[1:43:34] <Longlius> Grand Company
[1:43:37] <%LilyaFatal> GC vendor
[1:43:38] <+Castle_Kundarak> Market board or make them
[1:43:39] <%VictorVonLouche> Marketplace of course lol
[1:43:39] <MKII> market board is the easiest place
[1:43:39] <InXplotch> junk monger doesnt sell them no, you can get them from grand company
[1:43:39] <+the22cstomp> grand company
[1:43:39] <haisho> just hit the marketboard
[1:43:40] <+Havictos> @PatStaresAt Grand company as well
[1:43:42] <%Dregon_Azure> market board
[1:43:43] <+transporterthesequel> Yeah they are basically free
[1:43:45] <MeImoth> marketsplace for like 300g each
[1:43:51] <BreakfastSampler> just marketboard a full stack
[1:43:55] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Where is the grand company person?
[1:43:55] <LoreKeeper_Thal> da moff
[1:44:00] <$EsotericOdyssey> i just buy them off the market place
[1:44:02] <Daniel_Is_I> Avert your virgin eyes, moth
[1:44:05] <$EsotericOdyssey> like 100 at a time
[1:44:08] <%watts121> I sell them on MB sometimes
[1:44:10] <%RealThiele> ngl i just usually carry a max stack on me
[1:44:14] <+SpaceHobo55> idk what people think, sees robe, on that means we go back in time and meet the ascians
[1:44:17] <haisho> that's actually okay
[1:44:21] <%watts121> cuz my server is dumb and sometimes I can get like 5k for them
[1:44:21] <InXplotch> I switched classes after glamming just to hide the clothes from the youts until I got back, lol
[1:44:22] <%Kevlar_Caviar> i wonder what the next big crossover thing is gonna be - they've done monster hunter world and nier, what's next? (frankly a mh rise collab would be awesome and i kinda want them to do that)
[1:44:22] <AllenDeadman> glam prisms became super cheap
[1:44:39] <$EsotericOdyssey> oh jesus didn't realize pat was levelling SMN too
[1:44:43] <$EsotericOdyssey> nice
[1:44:47] <%SuckerPunchSyd> @spacehobo55 i mean the robes are very specific and you see them in amarot
[1:44:48] <InXplotch> prisms usually go for 200 a pop, if they're above that its high
[1:44:48] <haisho> having gloves on while wearing the clothes bothered me so I just didn't
[1:44:51] <Longlius> I sold a bunch during the new player influx earlier this year. Made a tidy sum of gil
[1:44:51] <%cobalt_phoenix_> wait you buy em off mb? is it not better to use like gc tickets or am i dumb
[1:44:51] <+transporterthesequel> Yeah the fact they haven't revealed the Alliance raid is...incredible.
[1:44:56] <WaifusSansFrontieres> @SpaceHobo55 because the robe has an ascian mask on it too?
[1:44:56] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Pat's going to give away his bunny boy bussy
[1:44:57] <heartlesshealer> yokai watch just returns for the next collab crossover
[1:45:03] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Slash every time you interact with the ancients
[1:45:26] <Daniel_Is_I> CLIPPING
[1:45:29] <Edible_Enthusiasm> slight clipping
[1:45:32] <%cobalt_phoenix_> mmm clipping
[1:45:34] <%ChrisPlaysThing> that's bad clipping
[1:45:35] <%JoshManVGH> The clipping!
[1:45:35] <Frostilk> coxBronze
[1:45:41] <%Kevlar_Caviar> mh rise's final boss would actually make a great raid boss considering its moveset and music
[1:45:43] <%SuckerPunchSyd> YEAH
[1:45:49] <MKII> I want a PSO collab because we never got one when they out Odin into PSO2
[1:45:50] <BreakfastSampler> shit game demand refund
[1:45:54] <InXplotch> remember you wont be able to use your plates in that zone, so if you get new gear you'll have to go back to re-glam if you so choose
[1:45:58] <MKII> put*
[1:45:59] <gespenst25> I'm thinking about wearing that robe and hanging out the sultana tree and stuff and wait to ambush people who've just killed their first Ascian with a level 90 Ascian...
[1:46:00] <%Dia_Dar> Cloud's glove
[1:46:06] <$EsotericOdyssey> why not just emperor's new gloves?
[1:46:11] <connerintuitive> Unplayable, unpatchable
[1:46:14] <heartlesshealer> mmmm glove freedom with sleeves down is always a thing that needs extra work put in for clipping and individual sets
[1:46:17] <%ChrisPlaysThing> but to be fair, as one of the people who would be making the checklist and then checking it for all possible combinations, it's hell
[1:46:19] <@TheYellowcouch> do it coward
[1:46:24] <+GigaSeifer> yes
[1:46:27] <karl_rex> no
[1:46:28] <%cobalt_phoenix_> yeyeye
[1:46:29] <+Havictos> fuck em
[1:46:29] <%ChrisPlaysThing> not on this game*
[1:46:29] <%Chichen> I DID.
[1:46:30] <%watts121> Azem would
[1:46:32] <%kid_flashionable> Oh nice
[1:46:33] <InXplotch> you are a familiar so of course you'd be dressed weird
[1:46:36] <%JoshManVGH> Assert your individuality!
[1:46:37] <%LouieRouie> yeh
[1:46:38] <jorniev> why
[1:46:43] <Daniel_Is_I> HERETIC
[1:46:44] <@TheYellowcouch> I ran around like a golden asshole it's fun
[1:46:44] <heartlesshealer> assert
[1:46:48] <%cobalt_phoenix_> BREAK THE NORM
[1:46:49] <InXplotch> Azem would dress their familiar as stupidly as possible and oyu know it
[1:46:49] <+Kyma1020> Azem would LUL
[1:46:49] <%JoshManVGH> Like a good Azem should
[1:46:52] <%solracc25> Hot Pink
[1:46:54] <Longlius> BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD BUN
[1:46:59] <+Havictos> Yeah Azem would that's true
[1:47:08] <%SuckerPunchSyd> @theyellowcouch robes that blind others LUL
[1:47:22] <%solracc25> azem the edgelord
[1:47:35] <Edible_Enthusiasm> I quite like the Aurora dyed robes that the watcher wears
[1:47:51] <InXplotch> yes
[1:47:54] <heartlesshealer> oh no I'm imagining the roleplay  that probably goes on in that area
[1:47:55] <+xephhq> yup
[1:47:57] <karl_rex> in settings
[1:47:58] <Noponis> stop dying it you are EXPRESSING INDIVIDUALITY
[1:47:58] <jorniev> BREAK THE LIMITS OF FASHION
[1:48:01] <ThatButler> there is
[1:48:12] <KatabolicRage> I think the bunny ears give him away
[1:48:13] <WaifusSansFrontieres> considering Azem probably created the Aura, being adressed as their familiar while being an Aura felt really good
[1:48:16] <InXplotch> save it like that and it'll return it to off whenever you apply the class
[1:48:24] <chaosking8000> can you put the mask on?
[1:48:25] <+FutaSnek> @PatStaresAt These streams have been super mellow and nice thx pat
[1:48:39] <jubejube56> Elidibus died for this
[1:48:41] <Longlius> individuality reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
[1:48:42] <KatabolicRage> pretty sure that zone has unique dialogue for a bunch of the races, someone mentioned my ears and tail
[1:48:42] <%androidd3162> Hi @PatStaresAt Any plans to play WarFrame for the New War expansion coming in a week?
[1:49:02] <InXplotch> Wont the glam not apply out there? you can only put plates in main cities, right?
[1:49:15] <MKII> @chaosking8000 eventually
[1:49:42] <+xephhq> YEAH
[1:49:44] <%cobalt_phoenix_> whoa what's that
[1:49:48] <youngsn0> Squadded up
[1:49:50] <+Shikari21> imagine not wearing the robe there smh
[1:49:53] <+Tizona824> Imagine not wearing your amaroutine robes
[1:49:58] <%Aeoneth> What is this heresy Pat
[1:50:00] <dickbuttwoman> oh man, he got here. This place is a wild ride. Cannot wait.
[1:50:12] <%Aeoneth> Amaroutines all wear 1 uniform robe
[1:50:12] <InXplotch> I like how many people put the robes on in this zone, way more than people wore tataru's coat I felt
[1:50:22] <MKII> is the minion for this place the cute axolotl
[1:50:22] <%walternatorz> shame you can never show it off
[1:50:23] <+Shikari21> JUDGED
[1:50:24] <%kyh9> This is great because it actually does a great job of replicating what it must have been like back then.  All the ancients you see are actual players who are, themselves, Azem
[1:50:26] <Edible_Enthusiasm> blind girl
[1:50:27] <%RealThiele> Egg of Elpis
[1:50:34] <MeImoth> remember Pat, 6 Fates in a area unlock the ability to buy a riding map
[1:50:36] <InXplotch> lol
[1:50:43] <Daniel_Is_I> Imagine not wearing the robes in this zone
[1:50:43] <+Shikari21> annoyed
[1:50:44] <%Aeoneth> Says the man in the non-canon colours
[1:50:46] <InXplotch> no more judging
[1:51:00] <heartlesshealer> dressing as lightly as possible in robe town
[1:51:10] <yngvez> No emet BibleThump
[1:51:32] <peachyprimrose> Try it bitch I killed you once and I'll do it again
[1:51:34] <LoreKeeper_Thal> try me bitch
[1:51:40] <wretchedautomaton> you could try
[1:51:46] <+Havictos> I kicked your ass once
[1:51:50] <Tracazoid> "I killed you once."
[1:51:57] <%RealThiele> hes so happy about that idea
[1:51:59] <Tenebrae94> why does emet look like xehanort?
[1:52:10] <peachyprimrose> YOU'RE highly irregular
[1:52:12] <Overhaul180> b/c it's a SE game
[1:52:13] <%DashXero> "Your face is irregular."
[1:52:21] <Edible_Enthusiasm> is Emet just Xemnas
[1:52:21] <+FutaSnek> waifu saved ya
[1:52:22] <+Cybercobra2> ikr?
[1:52:24] <%trancecarlito> You’re a talking dog
[1:52:29] <peachyprimrose> Owned
[1:52:30] <%RealThiele> LUL eat it sour puss
[1:52:30] <Eger007> yea
[1:52:32] <+Cybercobra2> its like.. "fuck i LIKE these people"
[1:52:35] <%PayCreeps_> yeah its a shame they go to commit genocide later huh
[1:52:38] <dickbuttwoman> He's already 1/2 Xehanort!
[1:52:40] <wretchedautomaton> emet sulk out here
[1:52:42] <Tracazoid> Emet actually just Norted everyone else
[1:52:43] <MKII> end days change a man
[1:52:44] <Guardiansaiyan> YOUR NOT MY DAD
[1:52:48] <%Reilata> @Tenebrae94 For conspiracy theories? LUL
[1:52:50] <@QueequegTheater> HE'S SO BISHIE
[1:52:52] <LoreKeeper_Thal> LUL
[1:52:58] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Get Fucked Emet
[1:52:59] <penitentpendant> He's simply too sexy
[1:53:04] <jorniev> START TWERKIN
[1:53:04] <+Roundelay11> Ah, but they said you were the spitting image of Azem
[1:53:05] <karl_rex> He looks like Xemnas
[1:53:05] <%watts121> If  you are a Hyur they say you pretty much look exactly like Azem
[1:53:06] <Tenebrae94> LUL
[1:53:07] <+Tizona824> I mean, there's the blue bird girl too
[1:53:09] <peachyprimrose> But my question is do we get to keep those robes for glam purposes
[1:53:11] <Durahand> thats totally something azem would do though
[1:53:16] <@Velyndra> imagine doing this as a knee-height gremlin
[1:53:21] <%RealThiele> Azem magicked some hot ears
[1:53:21] <+Kyma1020> Yes
[1:53:23] <+omnipotentcreature> bars
[1:53:25] <LoreKeeper_Thal> @peachyprimrose yes
[1:53:27] <%Nekros4442> @Roundelay11 They see people by their souls
[1:53:31] <%cobalt_phoenix_> i mean, you are a familiar to them
[1:53:32] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt If you're a lalafell or a roe Hythlodaeus asks Emet if he got the size wrong
[1:53:45] <peachyprimrose> @Nekros4442 Fuckin sweet
[1:53:46] <TheSpoonyBard27> My shrek oc stuck out like a sore onion
[1:53:47] <RushUnplugged> @watts121 on a midlander? because they didn't say it for my highlander
[1:53:50] <+xephhq> yup
[1:53:50] <InspectorWobble> yup
[1:53:52] <+BIumen> job interview
[1:53:53] <MKII> that's great
[1:53:56] <%UvBenServed> Femroe, can confirm
[1:53:57] <%barrakuta371> LUL
[1:53:58] <%RealThiele> his special eyes
[1:53:59] <heartlesshealer> nice
[1:54:01] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Yep
[1:54:08] <xxshadowxx416> i wish we could get a ff14 kingdom of heart crossover
[1:54:15] <Tracazoid> The houses only they can enter and acknowledgements like that almost, almost make me want to switch to Lala
[1:54:21] <%cobalt_phoenix_> do they say anything for hroth?
[1:54:23] <%watts121> @RushUnplugged the guy I watched had his guy looking exactly like derplander so probably
[1:54:35] <+brandonsbetow> he also has some flavor text that he does not appreciate you being taller than him @patstaresat
[1:54:49] <WaifusSansFrontieres> who in their right mind would want to deal with the beaurocracy of creating life
[1:54:52] <MKII> Disney creates so much red tape. they could barely put kingdom hearts into smash
[1:54:56] <peachyprimrose> Wow so just, voluntary death huh
[1:55:07] <%watts121> @cobalt_phoenix_ I don't think they do, but someone in the zone says something like "You look like a person with the face of a beast."
[1:55:08] <%RealThiele> Guess ill die
[1:55:14] <KatabolicRage> I mean, they apparantly just otherwise live forever I guess?
[1:55:14] <%Kevlar_Caviar> NO DON''T TEACH THE CHILD ABOUT DEATH SHE'S TOO PRECIOUS
[1:55:21] <+Tizona824> I mean, if you're immortal, I guess this is your retirement plan
[1:55:38] <Tracazoid> What is die, Edward. What is die?
[1:55:38] <yngvez> FeelsBadMan
[1:56:00] <Daskolin> OMG they literally OG sharlians
[1:56:05] <peachyprimrose> Wow wait so you don't get to just die if you WANT to?
[1:56:20] <%Kevlar_Caviar> LUL
[1:56:21] <peachyprimrose> Or is he just exaggerating and you can basically die when you want
[1:56:22] <InXplotch> no, you will sit and get your philosophy lesson
[1:56:25] <%watts121> Funny he says this when the Ascians are dedicated to resurrecting everyone.
[1:56:25] <+Tizona824> I mean, it cannot get more Socrates than this.
[1:56:28] <InXplotch> and you will LIKE IT
[1:56:39] <MKII> if you could prove reincarnation exists it could be kind of beautiful I guess
[1:56:44] <%solracc25> yes yes, the dirt needs nutrients
[1:56:44] <RubyPilot> @watts121 foresights a bitch
[1:56:45] <gespenst25> it might be a lot longer than that
[1:56:46] <%Kevlar_Caviar> HE DOESN'T KNOW CHAT
[1:56:47] <StarMechV> Emet sounds condescending even when speaking nicely
[1:56:47] <%RealThiele> beautiful fire from the sky
[1:56:50] <InspectorWobble> THIS PIANO
[1:56:55] <Tracazoid> Azem just fucking around and finding out
[1:56:59] <WaifusSansFrontieres> imagine "not dying" being a radical rebelious political view
[1:57:02] <%justcallmebobplease> How high of a high chair does a Lalafell need to be at this table?
[1:57:11] <Guardiansaiyan> SingsNote VirtualHug SingsNote VirtualHug SingsNote
[1:57:15] <+Kyma1020> I mean if you're basically immortal and fulfilled everything you've wanted, what else is there to do but die?
[1:57:18] <tigerfang86> h m m
[1:57:19] <%watts121> this piano is going crazy Soken
[1:57:21] <karl_rex> If so many unsundered souls were sent back to the lifestream wouldn't a bunch of ancients be reborn eventually?
[1:57:23] <tigerfang86> H m m m m m
[1:57:25] <%GallowsDrop> Reminder that Hermes becomes "I want to die and kill everyone with me" Fandaniel
[1:57:30] <+MelodyMedley> Goddamn this piano
[1:57:31] <@QueequegTheater> @Kyma1020 Hang out with your bros
[1:57:35] <penitentpendant> So I assume she's a reference to 'the blue bird of happiness'
[1:57:35] <+Tizona824> Higher...oh, higher...
[1:57:42] <%valriot> their concept of death is aa duty
[1:57:42] <+impacteddarrien> That man is 80% neck
[1:57:43] <LoreKeeper_Thal> Soken GOING MENTAL on that piano
[1:57:45] <%kyh9> So the ancients are a suicide cult?
[1:57:45] <%Kevlar_Caviar> HERMES YOU MONSTER
[1:57:49] <Edible_Enthusiasm> bird girl can kind of read minds
[1:57:49] <+BIumen> Twitter
[1:57:49] <AllenDeadman> ya think?
[1:57:54] <StarMechV> oh no, you're giving the emotion empath feel the sense of DEATH.
[1:57:57] <@QueequegTheater> DO NOT BE SAD NEAR THE EMPATH PLEASE
[1:57:58] <%kyh9> beautiful music
[1:58:00] <peachyprimrose> Come with me, small child
[1:58:00] <Edible_Enthusiasm> or project her thoughts
[1:58:05] <%kyh9> So this is a death cult
[1:58:11] <xxshadowxx416> what
[1:58:12] <Noponis> way to simplify things
[1:58:14] <+BIumen> Greeks weren't immortal
[1:58:14] <peachyprimrose> I'll get you away from Emet-Selch, don't worry LMAO
[1:58:16] <WaifusSansFrontieres> its more like working an office job for 300 years and then calling it wuits
[1:58:16] <+Tizona824> RIP COOL MAC
[1:58:16] <yngvez> suicide is chad af
[1:58:18] <%Reilata> So it's like that Fatal Frame.
[1:58:19] <MKII> "DO IT DO IT"
[1:58:23] <%retrohazard> Fatal Frame Wet Maiden was based on the greeks
[1:58:23] <tigerfang86> they DO love it
[1:58:26] <%DashXero> "Bro, watch me chug this hemlock!"
[1:58:27] <%valriot> Less suicide, and more "i have done my part". its a weird philosophy
[1:58:27] <%watts121> and depending on your employer, japan is a suicide cult
[1:58:32] <artoflec> I CAN'T believe
[1:58:38] <WaifusSansFrontieres> their concept of death is so entirely different
[1:58:38] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[1:58:39] <RushUnplugged> I mean if you were ageless and immortal, you'd start being defined by your life purpose, and if that ends, it kinda makes sense
[1:58:44] <%Kevlar_Caviar> meteion is so fucking CUTE
[1:58:44] <+Roundelay11> They're a pack of immortals that live for millenia and then off themselves when they're sick of living
[1:58:48] <%JoshManVGH> Blurb
[1:58:50] <+Cybercobra2> yea its probably just a case of they live so fucking long. that they needed a exuse for people to die to keep the natural order of things going
[1:58:53] <%valriot> what you mean pat :)
[1:58:58] <%GallowsDrop> I mean the Ancients do apparently live for INCREDIBLY long so it's not surprising some just wanna die sometimes
[1:59:02] <smward87> as others said, they are immortal and a race that live to carry out their assigned duties. if they accomplish their duty there is nothing left to look forward too besides death, which they will not achieve via natural means
[1:59:05] <%watts121> what are you doing Pat?1/1? You forgot the leash!
[1:59:13] <heartlesshealer> the empath, just after experiencing all of Thavnair
[1:59:19] <StarMechV> Ancient Ascians literally "I guess I'll die"
[1:59:23] <%Reilata> Yeah, living so long death might make death look pretty nice eventually.
[1:59:26] <+Tizona824> All Amaroutines are more or less immortal, so whenever they get tired of living they just disenchant themselves
[1:59:35] <Daskolin> Must PROTEC birb
[1:59:38] <+fetrigon> pretty TakeNRG
[1:59:39] <InXplotch> the vods of this are on pat's yt, right?
[1:59:45] <jubejube56> Akasha bird
[1:59:45] <yngvez> she's actually taller than a femore, when you think about it
[1:59:46] <+transporterthesequel> I can think of few worst things then having and Empath with the Warrior of light
[2:00:03] <%SuckerPunchSyd> @inxplotch not yet
[2:00:04] <wretchedautomaton> oh my god you're right i didn't even think about her scale
[2:00:08] <+Akizea> @transporterthesequel i mean usually we're happy all things considered, weve juist been through some shit
[2:00:09] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Oh
[2:00:11] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Sweet
[2:00:14] <wretchedautomaton> she's at least 6 feet tall
[2:00:22] <peachyprimrose> Wow there's only 233 in my world queue?
[2:00:23] <InXplotch> bless, I didnt watch your earlier streams cause I am still playing through myself, so I didnt want to risk bein spoiled
[2:00:24] <tigerfang86> bruh
[2:00:28] <%Kevlar_Caviar> JESUS YOU'RE RIGHT SHE'S TALL AS SHIT
[2:00:31] <%watts121> @Tizona824 it makes sense especially if you believe that you'll come back with a blank slate
[2:00:31] <@Spydurman> Spydurman subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 35 months! I really loved the part in Arcane when they looked at the camera and said "We really were the Legends of League all along" Hope you're enjoying FF14!
[2:00:32] <@goose_attack_almanac> Jesums, what happened since last stream? Pat go back to Ascian time?
[2:00:36] <wretchedautomaton> felt like being cute, lay off
[2:00:37] <%JhinBappo> Hello today! Just finished Heavesnward. Holy moly that was intense..
[2:00:38] <+MelodyMedley> Wow
[2:00:41] <%GallowsDrop> RACE DEPENDANT DIALOGUE
[2:00:44] <heartlesshealer> All Viera are familiars :)
[2:00:48] <%Kevlar_Caviar> @goose_attack_almanac ye
[2:00:54] <+fetrigon> LUL
[2:00:55] <+transporterthesequel> Yep
[2:01:00] <%JoshManVGH> Oh shit your right!
[2:01:01] <ThatButler> She big
[2:01:01] <%solracc25> eeeeh nevermind the ears
[2:01:02] <+Akizea> yup
[2:01:09] <heartlesshealer> oh yeah
[2:01:10] <InXplotch> Yes, everything is BEEG
[2:01:16] <+MelodyMedley> She's actually big
[2:01:19] <Guardiansaiyan> fitness to EXIST
[2:01:21] <AllenDeadman> huh
[2:01:25] <StarMechV> Basically they are the God Factory
[2:01:35] <peachyprimrose> @JhinBappo Uh... are you sure you wanna be watching this...
[2:01:40] <WaifusSansFrontieres> Send the Platipus back for another revision
[2:01:43] <WaifusSansFrontieres> still has some kinks
[2:01:44] <tanarath> It
[2:01:48] <@goose_attack_almanac> highly clinical
[2:01:49] <+transporterthesequel> A little FUCKY WUCKY
[2:01:51] <%GallowsDrop> i actually wanna traverse this Zone at normal size I really wanna see what it's like
[2:01:52] <jorniev> this is totally the new area in WOW
[2:01:58] <Guardiansaiyan> don't kinkshame the PLATYPUS
[2:01:59] <+Cybercobra2> also no wonder emet was perfectly fine sacrificing our world to bring back theirs.
[2:02:01] <%watts121> well if you were a walking 3D printer your opinions would change too!
[2:02:04] <Daskolin> Like Greek?
[2:02:04] <ThatButler> kind of understandable to see such a warped view on life when you can create and destroy it at will
[2:02:05] <jubejube56> Investigate whether Axolotl is allowed
[2:02:07] <%JhinBappo> @JhinBappo I don't mind spoilers, so It's cool. Thanks for the concern though.
[2:02:08] <@Velyndra> its hard to have a different view on it when its all things they've created by hand
[2:02:11] <Fiendmaw> This is what happens when you can casually create life
[2:02:19] <+SH1NK1R0> they view life as almost entirely transactional.
[2:02:26] <%valriot> LUL LUL LUL
[2:02:33] <heartlesshealer> LUL
[2:02:34] <+Kyma1020> It's so much better in every way
[2:02:37] <%Reilata> If you can just ... make make things exist, then wiping it out is probably nothing.
[2:02:37] <jorniev> AND BETTER THEMES
[2:02:39] <%SuckerPunchSyd> LUL
[2:02:40] <peachyprimrose> WoW devs malding as we speak
[2:02:41] <+Tizona824> The memes write themselves
[2:02:42] <penitentpendant> "WHO SQUEALED!?"
[2:02:42] <%GallowsDrop> WoW but GOOD
[2:02:44] <%Reilata> -one make
[2:02:46] <%TONYOO101> Like that moon rabbit?
[2:02:49] <Eger007> but you can walk on water there
[2:02:53] <%walternatorz> WoW they already coppied FFXI Sky and Sea zones, this is just the cherry on top
[2:02:53] <InspectorWobble> and more story relevance
[2:02:53] <%retrohazard> Did that one wow trailer basically do a shot for shot remake of a XIV trailer too
[2:02:57] <%JhinBappo> @JhinBappo I only play so much every couple of months, so I'll forget most of it all anyways.
[2:02:58] <WaifusSansFrontieres> It's also thematically simmiliar and also done better in that regard
[2:03:00] <tanarath> Has ff14 decided to steal something but actually make it good?
[2:03:00] <+SH1NK1R0> i said the same thing. the new zone in wow is both thematically the same and even is described in game as the same thing
[2:03:04] <@Velyndra> :)
[2:03:09] <+Krivvan> don't forget that The Watcher refers to itself as "The Jailer"
[2:03:11] <%watts121> I LOVE THIS CUTSCENE

[2:14:36] <+Jackgar> Which is dope, because the old pvp armor is tight
[2:14:37] <+transporterthesequel> Although that's gonna get more and more tenuous as time passes.
[2:14:39] <MKII> make a macro that glams you fast enough to not spoil people in public
[2:14:41] <heartlesshealer> oh wow yeah don't
[2:14:42] <%Rumbutt> I just manually glam'd my gear and put it in my dresser after I was done with the zone
[2:14:47] <+Havictos> If the end of the world is going on I'm damn well going to look stylish while it happens
[2:14:49] <penitentpendant> That will last all of 17 hours ago when I saw it on the moon
[2:14:52] <+Twistedlink07> or, vice-versa
[2:14:53] <Fiendmaw> I definitely saw someone at limsa MB with this on
[2:14:55] <+MelodyMedley> Big jerk move
[2:14:57] <penitentpendant> Sigh
[2:14:57] <@QueequegTheater> Wait what does favored destination do
[2:15:11] <Fiendmaw> Reduce cost to 0
[2:15:14] <+transporterthesequel> @QueequegTheater Half off I believe
[2:15:15] <zaephia> @Twistedlink07 Do you mean from the Ocular?
[2:15:16] <%afronooch> reduce tele fee
[2:15:19] <+Havictos> @QueequegTheater Half price I think?
[2:15:19] <@QueequegTheater> NotLikeThis
[2:15:20] <penitentpendant> @QueequegTheater Half cost to teleport
[2:15:21] <haisho> oh yeah there will be people that just don't care
[2:15:23] <zaephia> @QueequegTheater half price
[2:15:25] <MKII> favored destination is half off I think
[2:15:40] <%ClericOfSparda> LUL LUL
[2:15:40] <MKII> you get like 3 favored slots or so
[2:15:46] <haisho> like you'd port into Old Sharlayan and whaddya know someone's wearing the robes out in broad daylight
[2:15:56] <%afronooch> i should probably change mine since I dont live in bozja anymore lol
[2:17:52] <Fiendmaw> Oh the 0 cost thing is only for the 3FA?
[2:17:57] <+Twistedlink07> @zaephia Well yeah, like, from Old Sharlayan through to The Occular, through the portal again to the old-times, etc. Something tells me that's "closer" than, say, Orthard :p
[2:19:04] <+Havictos> @Fiendmaw yep
[2:19:10] <Blank9> the moon is closer to uldah than thavnair, apparently
[2:19:51] <%Ynkubus_> Thats cause its calculating via the Tower of babil
[2:19:59] <+SH1NK1R0> @Blank9 its because the moon teleporter is in garlemald which is cl0ser to uldah than thavnair
[2:20:41] <+Havictos> With the moon being a spaceship next expansion could literally be anything I just realized
[2:20:43] <Fiendmaw> The funny thing is Thavnair and Garlemand are really close on the ilsabard map
[2:20:57] <Edible_Enthusiasm> what is
[2:20:58] <Daniel_Is_I> Zone is gorgeous
[2:21:04] <Fiendmaw> Next expansion can't be ANYTHING because they announced Is hgard Housing
[2:21:05] <Mitchellni> How long did you have to wait to get in? Currently 6600 in queue  and been waiting 30 minutes
[2:21:07] <Edible_Enthusiasm> oh I guess. the sky yes.
[2:21:23] <Daniel_Is_I> The last zone was big misery and tension, this is the release from that
[2:21:28] <jubejube56> Oh big echo
[2:21:29] <+transporterthesequel> BEHOLD, THE APOCALYPSE!(beautiful garden)
[2:21:31] <Fiendmaw> Currently on 3 hours including multiple 2002s
[2:21:35] <%Ynkubus_> Apocalypses can be pretty too
[2:21:37] <%UvBenServed> Like Garlemald. Super pretty
[2:21:41] <jorniev> WALKING TO THE END
[2:21:41] <%LouieRouie> And Galemald
[2:21:41] <%JoshManVGH> The world is fuck, but it's pretty fuck.
[2:21:42] <+Shikari21> i dont hear it
[2:21:43] <xxshadowxx416> it was hell for like a hour
[2:21:43] <chaosking8000> The end of the world never looked better.
[2:21:43] <+transporterthesequel> Nah, no echo here.
[2:21:44] <+Cybercobra2> well yea, gotta make something pretty in order to destroy it
[2:21:44] <MaybeFalco> i mean, garlemald didnt look too nice in terms of being destroyed
[2:21:48] <Tracazoid> Lavos hasn't killed Zeal yet
[2:21:52] <%walternatorz> I don't hear an echo
[2:21:52] <+Havictos> This is the pallet cleanser after shit last time
[2:21:53] <heartlesshealer> ?
[2:21:56] <Ids560> hey I'm sure the sky will be fucky when you get back
[2:22:06] <jubejube56> Huh I’m the only one that hears it?
[2:22:09] <jubejube56> Weird

[2:22:54] <jubejube56> How odd
[2:23:18] <+Havictos> he's waking up it took him a bit
[2:23:18] <peachyprimrose> God this expansion's tracks are so good
[2:23:20] <KatabolicRage> that and a lot of female characters tend to be min height for cutesy reasons, I laugh as I crank my female miqo's height to max and tower a full head taller than 90% of catgirls

[2:24:26] <Fiendmaw> He's definitely thinking he got you good
[2:24:43] <+Havictos> @KatabolicRage I made my fem xeala small because I like the idea of the strongest person in the world being shorter than everyone but lalas
[2:24:49] <%SuckerPunchSyd> @dickbuttwoman I’m thinking of using mine only to make my femroe taller LUL
[2:25:24] <Edible_Enthusiasm> isnt that butterfly the same colors as the level 90 hat
[2:25:27] <peachyprimrose> Who wouldn't be melancholy having to sit in an enclosed space with you, Hades
[2:25:31] <zaephia> @Twistedlink07 Old Sharlayan is quite the distance from the ocular, but if you got the ferry to limsa and teleported to mor dhona then that would definitely be cheaper
[2:25:40] <gespenst25> the ....RULES OF NATURE
[2:25:42] <tanarath> uh oh
[2:25:48] <%watts121> Primals don't have souls
[2:25:56] <Daniel_Is_I> Ironic that he says this in front of Emet, who deemed you not alive
[2:26:01] <heartlesshealer> so what do summoners have
[2:26:16] <%JoshManVGH> That's super sad.
[2:26:18] <@Velyndra> primals don't have souls, and the sundered don't have 'full' souls
[2:26:29] <Edible_Enthusiasm> does empath bird have a soul?
[2:26:36] <KatabolicRage> so I guess part of his job with these creatures is that they should be able to self sustain and have souls if your gonna turn them loose
[2:26:38] <peachyprimrose> @Daniel_Is_I It's almost like he was full of shit
[2:26:40] <Daniel_Is_I> Yeah they're way too big by default
[2:26:41] <smward87> arcane entities. they're just being of pure aether and nothing else @heartlesshealer
[2:26:42] <+GigaSeifer> I 100% thought the final boss was throwing ifrit at me over and over

[2:26:46] <zaephia> titan is huge
[2:26:48] <MKII> YEEEEE
[2:26:49] <%Chichen> @PatStaresAt its SO HARD to see if the primals are full sized. They just block the camera

[2:27:02] <%furiousfurioso> That happened to me yea
[2:27:04] <MKII> it's just reusing the primal effects it's great
[2:27:11] <%Chichen> @PatStaresAt I can now 100% confirm they are MINI full versions.
[2:27:14] <SaltyAzteca> pocket sized Ifrit
[2:27:16] <haisho> Titan once hid AoEs from me
[2:27:23] <@QueequegTheater> I LOVE MY TITAN EGI, TAKE IT BACK
[2:27:24] <Fiendmaw> @PatStaresAt Is there a reason you are not playing DRK through Endwalker?
[2:27:31] <Noponis> you can just adjust the size
[2:27:36] <+Havictos> yes
[2:27:37] <%Chichen> Yeah.
[2:27:39] <Edible_Enthusiasm> Yeah.
[2:27:39] <+Vampireinarm> it got shit canned lmao

[2:27:42] <Fiendmaw> I understand

[2:27:53] <%Chichen> WAR is just better DRK
[2:27:53] <Srthunda> I like garuda egi, but it aint garuda
[2:27:53] <tanarath> Dark Knight is on suicide watch
[2:28:00] <WaifusSansFrontieres> it did not get shit canned, people are just salty cause it didnt get even more stuff
[2:28:03] <+transporterthesequel> yeah...
[2:28:05] <Blank9> yeah..
[2:28:06] <+Havictos> @Fiendmaw Jokes aside DRK isn't bad but everyone else got better stuff
[2:28:17] <yngvez> Square hates drk FeelsBadMan
[2:28:22] <heartlesshealer> feed these living crystals
[2:28:30] <WaifusSansFrontieres> its still the same amount of good
[2:28:30] <Blank9> players in queue: 4 for multiple refreshes
[2:28:38] <Fiendmaw> Yeah,it didn't get any fancy shmancy stuff that's for sure
[2:28:38] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[2:28:41] <Blank9> this is edging too hard
[2:28:43] <+transporterthesequel> @WaifusSansFrontieres It's more complicated then that. The gist is, they don't know what to do with the class, which is reflected in the scattershot ability improvements.
[2:28:46] <Ids560> I hope we get Ramuh at some point
[2:28:56] <smward87> it's the self healing. every tank but DRK can basically self-sustain to the point where a healer isn't needed. DRK can not. at all. @WaifusSansFrontieres
[2:28:56] <+JustToWatch> lol
[2:29:06] <+xephhq> the destination
[2:29:08] <@Velyndra> you gotta hit the destination marker
[2:29:09] <arduousScavenger> Lightning Bolt!
[2:29:11] <Daniel_Is_I> On the destination, not the sprite
[2:29:12] <MKII> shock the glowie
[2:29:17] <%SuckerPunchSyd> You gotta hit the destination
[2:29:17] <%strugglepunk2> gotta hit the sparkles
[2:29:19] <%Chichen> pat, the destination marker.
[2:29:19] <%JoshManVGH> Put it on the spot your standing
[2:29:19] <+Twistedlink07> this is fun to watch
[2:29:20] <+xephhq> target the destination
[2:29:20] <%JohnAtDawn> I find it weird- and by weird I mean really fucking annoying- that the Scholar memes fell off hard, but people are still okay with shitting on Drk.
[2:29:22] <@QueequegTheater> LIGHTNING VANQUISH MY ENEMY
[2:29:31] <+Shikari21> it is
[2:29:38] <@Velyndra> yes but screw you
[2:29:38] <Edible_Enthusiasm> Destination
[2:29:40] <@QueequegTheater> LUL
[2:29:44] <+BlubRobe> I mean, you don't want someone dumping your food over your head right?
[2:29:47] <smward87> I did the same thing Pat. don't feel bad. i'm dumb too.
[2:29:47] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Its dumb
[2:29:48] <17sevens> back to front, the destination is what you need to target. i did the exact same thing and had no idea what was goingon
[2:29:50] <+suicidallobo> somethings stupid but its not that lol
[2:29:50] <+the22cstomp> @JohnAtDawn it's because the drk changes for 90 were so boring that no one is excited for it
[2:30:04] <17sevens> @BlubRobe speak for yourself
[2:30:04] <heartlesshealer> Destination as opposed to target hmm
[2:30:19] <+Cybercobra2> LUL
[2:30:19] <General_Terro> LUL
[2:30:20] <Edible_Enthusiasm> HahaBall
[2:30:23] <+JustToWatch> fuck they di

[2:30:24] <SaltyAzteca> LUL oh shit
[2:30:25] <arduousScavenger> Vs the Chad Lalafell
[2:30:26] <Fiendmaw> Wait didn't they fix that supposedly?
[2:30:28] <LoreKeeper_Thal> it was worse before, they changed it to hunch less
[2:30:28] <tanarath> LUL
[2:30:29] <+Angrec> hey where is the vod at for this stream? I kind of want to go back and watch what i missed

[2:30:32] <+SeventhVice> virgin pose?
[2:30:36] <Daskolin> They are twinks
[2:30:40] <%GallowsDrop> Virgin Viera Vs Chad Hrothgar
[2:30:42] <2Bs_USB_port> does that make hrothgar ultra virgins
[2:30:42] <+BlackJack607> Cuase their relationship with women is also terrible @PatStaresAt
[2:30:43] <MidnightPacif1c> coxBam
[2:30:51] <+JustToWatch> it's to reinforce that they are submissive and breedable
[2:30:52] <IntenseNerdRage> @johnatdawn  Then tell DRK to stop being an actual inferior tank compared to the other 3
[2:31:13] <arduousScavenger> Is this the Crystalline Entity episode of Star Trek?
[2:31:16] <Fiendmaw> Chad Femgars vs Virgin bunbois
[2:31:21] <+SeventhVice> @PatStaresAt are male viera in a Snu snu situation?
[2:31:25] <Sagenvee> Then stop playing DRK. They'll rework it again KEK
[2:31:26] <%daPuertoRicanGoku> daPuertoRicanGoku subscribed with Prime. 
[2:31:30] <%trancecarlito> arent the bunnys literal chads
[2:31:46] <smward87> the females, yes. @trancecarlito
[2:31:51] <smward87> the males, no
[2:31:58] <@goose_attack_almanac> fuc I read that as mountain dew
[2:32:04] <%trancecarlito> no the males are literally a sigma male species
[2:32:19] <+Havictos> The females only interact with the males for breeding if I recall
[2:32:19] <%trancecarlito> they literally fuck off in the forest for 3 years killing anything that comes close then come home for an orgy then leave again
[2:32:31] <Fiendmaw> Gotta say zone music has been impeccable in this expansion
[2:32:32] <+fetrigon> dusk. A sign of the coming end.

[2:34:37] <MidnightPacif1c> CoolStoryBob
[2:34:40] <dickbuttwoman> A friend of mine made the connection that these are all the "platonic ideals" of what they are. That is the platonic ideal of Goobue.

[2:36:23] <jorniev> the get gud energy
[2:36:28] <%Birdigalore> Dynamaxing
[2:36:35] <%Mantorok06> We named it, Hermesium
[2:36:36] <%Reilata> The most I played of FF11, was the cardgame that came with it.
[2:36:53] <Saltmeisterr> I hate this small child

[8:18:59] <%kid_flashionable> psaBig gabberWee that was fucking amazing
[8:19:04] <%lucky_icarus> So correct me if I'm wrong, that means Hydaelyn's creation WAS NOT via consent but sacrifice yeah?
[8:19:08] <%trancecarlito> Venat is literally The Boss.
[8:19:13] <tanarath> @joshmanvgh almost like the moon serves a weird purpose, huh?
[8:19:13] <aflowerybard> Wait what happened??
[8:19:19] <+Havictos> Nah guys shadowlands is gonna blow this out of the water guys

[8:20:13] <jorniev> and who cares
[8:20:13] <%cooldude69xx> They can't even top the scale of this with a multiversal scale threat because of final fantasy lifestream stuff. Where DO they go?

[8:20:15] <+Havictos> @tanarath I don't don't what the true purpose of the loporitts are I love them and would die for them

[8:21:29] <%Archmortal> I was enjoying Endwalker's story more than Shadowbringers on the whole, but I kept wondering how they'd top the hype as fuck ending of 5.0.  And then I saw this scene
[8:21:29] <@QueequegTheater> Apparently WoW is literally pulling a Griffith Did Nothing Wrong with their genocidal villain of the last three expacs
[8:21:30] <@QueequegTheater> lmao

[8:24:13] <%RealThiele> new podcast topic this mmo has a lot of shit in its interface
[8:24:13] <%JoshManVGH> Seems like the Meniat is the embodiment of extream Nihilism while Azem and Venat are embodiments of Absurdism. I kinda dig the messaging.
[8:24:16] <@TheYellowcouch> It's what she wants too
[8:24:16] <%Aeoneth> @PatStaresAt also pat if you want to change the Carbie look,  you can use the command petglamour "Carbuncle" "Whatever you want to change it to in quotes"
[8:24:16] <+Isoterica> also very appropriate
[8:24:18] <Sol_Install> EEEEEH
[8:24:19] <%Arweynn> well that comment aged like fine milk

[8:24:53] <$StrawberryPantsu> When Meteion isn't on screen,everyone should be asking: "Hey? Wheres Meteion?"

[8:25:16] <BanjoParadox> my mans here actually got THROUGH the server queue? sorcery.
[8:25:16] <%Mendin> Everyone always asks "Where's Meteion" and nobody asks "How's Meteion"
[8:25:26] <%BridgeWowDah> <3
[8:25:39] <%RealThiele> Naaaaail
[8:25:47] <@TheYellowcouch> Isn't it funny that the ultimate evil is Met(ion)or again
[8:25:52] <BarnYardFiddler> All the homies love Meteion
[8:25:52] <%EynoStiles> @mendin she is emo girl now. lol
[8:25:56] <tanarath> Just in case, kinda.
[8:25:59] <%JoshManVGH> All of this, everything, litterally ONE GUY
[8:26:00] <DirtyMiser> every trial has been all tanks in the party finder and it's been fun
[8:26:08] <Profmcstevie> Major points just DROPPING on our heads
[8:26:08] <Lixagon> this the start or the end?
[8:26:11] <@QueequegTheater> wowee read fuck fuck
[8:26:25] <%Mendin> So if you think about it, Sia in that Fly Me To The Moon video is like a weird space flying child so is she also a meteion?
[8:26:30] <%shootbang_exe> all pat should say on the podcast is that it left him speechless and off balance
[8:26:31] <%lucky_icarus> @dirtymiser Oh man...waiting 30mins for the final trial was ROUGH!

[8:26:58] <+JustToWatch> I have a BAD idea for where this could go after this. It involves Sephiroth
[8:27:05] <%Aeoneth> TBF that scene was emoptionally draining for me too
