[0:12:00] <+Estuko> @NWR_James Steve Buscemi, you just can't see his mouth moving
[0:12:01] <AlexanderTheConquerer> now that's a statement
[0:12:07] <ShichiNoBushi> What about Mother 2
[0:12:14] <%ElenaManetta> Some of Earthbound's mechanics suffer quite a bit from "early gaming era" where it just wasn't figured out how to make "That mechanic" work nicer
[0:12:16] <DarkCloud79> Too low audio
[0:12:18] <shadytreeofknowledge> he creeping in the back
[0:12:20] <%NWR_James> @estuko oh good I was scared

[0:13:16] <AlexanderTheConquerer> earthbound is the kind of thing that can be really formative, but doesn't have a huge amount of substance beyond that

[1:19:26] <+valkuma> Emet Selch has hidden missable dialogue whenever he's standing around after cutscenes
[1:19:32] <Monkeyweed21> the clavicle is necessary for dick vore
[1:19:38] <%Sasquatch_John> Ah yeah Man Flesh!

[1:20:38] <RamenRiderZ> lv77 atm, cant wait
[1:20:44] <+valkuma> I heard in an interview that they wanted this to be the best expansion ever
[1:20:55] <+valkuma> Theyre also passing WoW
[1:20:55] <Monkeyweed21> YoshI P dick vored that stream technician and gained more power
[1:20:58] <%NWR_James> I'd bet budget is up based on what we've seen
[1:21:07] <%Maids4lyfe> teaWut
[1:21:07] <shadytreeofknowledge> how long is this game can i beat it in an afternoon
[1:21:09] <%spiritofmojave> The Titania EX mount and fight are fucking phenomenal
[1:21:16] <+StrawberryPantsu> That first dungeon was dope
[1:21:17] <+valkuma> FFXIV has over a million and WoW is less than a million i think
[1:21:23] <marisakirisame225> hey pat i just wanted to drop in and tell you that im glad i got to find your twitch you have always been my favorite with your crazy talks i hope to enjoy watching you stare at things
[1:21:24] <shadytreeofknowledge> WoW had the Panda right?
[1:21:25] <%Shady_Squid> But 14 is better than WoW...
[1:21:26] <KatabolicRage> WoW doesn't release numbers anymore but a leak revealed it was as low as 1.7m
[1:21:29] <snowmanse> WoW was confirmed as under 2 million at the start of BFA. And BFA has not done well.
[1:21:30] <GarbageQueenEllie> This game deserves waaay more than WoW
[1:21:30] <%sshen> WoW is probably under a mil by now
[1:21:35] <$Yakobro> no way lol
[1:21:37] <%tyler274> 1.7 mil as of october 2018
[1:21:37] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat Maybe its vanilla wow
[1:21:38] <%Diabetic> Wow is under a million
[1:21:42] <+valkuma> There was a leak from blizzard
[1:21:43] <Vitoria90> WoW is losing players to WoW classic, mind you.
[1:21:44] <+StrawberryPantsu> Both games reached 1mil recently :^)
[1:21:44] <%tyler274> on the way into the content draught
[1:21:45] <%Halowood> rumoured below 1mil
[1:21:45] <shadytreeofknowledge> im glad you see my shit posting its my first time
[1:21:48] <%tyler274> 2 months after bfa
[1:21:49] <$cureneckbeard> how many is runescape
[1:21:50] <%Maids4lyfe> lol
[1:21:52] <%theMrRoboto> last 2-3 expacs fucked their subs bad
[1:21:52] <+VashyronM> WoW is shooting itself in the head
[1:21:55] <reonome> WoW classic still a thing
[1:21:56] <%demegodz> The Evil is defeated

[1:33:52] <majindusto> Pats character is too big...It should have been a Lalafell
[1:34:01] <shadytreeofknowledge> the potato
[1:34:02] <RupanSen> Pat's character is basically Anime Sean Connery
[1:34:17] <Monkeyweed21> Pat's character is overcompensating for his stumps
[1:34:20] <shadytreeofknowledge> saxton
[1:34:29] <%Deft_Thought> I've always appreciated the neat Final Fantasy renditions of western fantasy monsters
[1:34:29] <+valkuma> This quest line is so silly. youre doing all this work just so you can sneak into the town full of sick people for Minfilia

[1:35:59] <%Ranryu692> this sounds like a Naruto music
[1:36:05] <%doc_ock_rokc> Are you sitting crosslegged on a fucking behemoth?!
[1:36:08] <Thalchampz> yup this is the battle theme
[1:36:14] <alrobot2014> does behemoth do a cosmetic explosion when you despawn him?

[1:37:16] <Monkeyweed21> dummy thicc

[1:37:19] <shadytreeofknowledge> @Resderp good the potatoes deserved it
[1:37:21] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat Its offical your shorter then a Gnome
[1:37:28] <%GummiBunnies> big boi
[1:37:32] <Resderp> That is not a Gnome
[1:37:33] <%spiritofmojave> @masterdecoder cool, like DRK then. cheers!
[1:37:34] <%VioletHeart> Original mythology for gnomes was that they were just earth elementals.
[1:37:36] <%solomonpun> Isn't gnome also the name of earth elementals?
[1:37:36] <%VioletHeart> So it makes sense.
[1:37:39] <@Velyndra> @AngriestPat gnomes are earth elementals in old mythos
[1:37:39] <shadytreeofknowledge> @Resderp hope they burn in that deep fryer
[1:37:43] <Sol_Install> Gnomes are rock elementals so they went with the og verison
[1:37:50] <Thalchampz> @solomonpun that's Mana series
[1:38:04] <TigerFlavoredCereal> I'm Gonna Go Play Minecraft Now, See You Spice Cowhands
[1:38:10] <%doc_ock_rokc> Does that mean we might see Daemons and Geniuses?
[1:38:21] <%Diabetic> This music sounds like it's from Silent Hill @AngriestPat
[1:38:26] <shadytreeofknowledge> @Resderp yall only get arms through magic or just being forgotten under the treadmill for months
[1:38:28] <Monkeyweed21> Pat you read Berserk

[1:38:51] <%Fenrirlives> @AngriestPat same category as Undine, Salamander, and Sylphs!
[1:38:56] <%demegodz> Sensual Porn Music yeaaaah
[1:38:56] <%NWR_James> the bad shit
[1:39:05] <shadytreeofknowledge> porn music always has a sax
[1:39:15] <%supercasualboom> Fun fact: the pronunciation of gnomes in my native language actually legit means “to pee”.
[1:39:16] <shadytreeofknowledge> for the sex paige joke
[1:39:22] <Zombrocom> Gnomes are earth elementals in old myth, but there were also tiny in old myth as well
[1:39:29] <RamenRiderZ> This area's music is pretty Nier to me
[1:39:49] <+StrawberryPantsu> FEET
[1:39:55] <+StrawberryPantsu> Stone Feet
[1:40:05] <Zombrocom> Synonym of pygmy even
[1:40:32] <Resderp> My cup is warm too but that doesnt mean I was here.
[1:40:35] <+StrawberryPantsu> It's full of Amaro cum
[1:40:36] <majindusto> cuP

[1:41:05] <Resderp> Also wouldnt it be hot with the constant daylight anyway?
[1:41:07] <Zoh87> should they end the game once the level cap is 99
[1:41:15] <%Diabetic> I see elves are just as dumb in this game as FF11
[1:41:19] <%spiritofmojave> why are you like this Uri
[1:41:22] <shadytreeofknowledge> that yugioh card in the background is drunk
[1:41:24] <alrobot2014> does anyone else ever speak like urianger
[1:41:44] <$supersmolman> rock man
[1:41:46] <%chimaera24> @Resderp I think they've said that the light is just cosmetic, it doesn't create heat
[1:42:23] <shadytreeofknowledge> potatoes fear heat @chimaera24 lol
[1:43:02] <+korth367> is that a freakin buster sword
[1:43:25] <Resderp> gunbreaker swords are too small for lalafells clearly.
[1:43:32] <majindusto> GUNBLADES ARE COOL

[2:04:22] <TioXyco> and it plays the bike chase theme fom ff7
[2:04:26] <%Jarvanii> yea it's $30 I think
[2:04:35] <shadytreeofknowledge> fuck that bike then
[2:04:44] <Zoh87> costs more than ff7 and a copy of advent children lmao
[2:04:56] <%Gogogolem> Files aren't used on wood though...
[2:05:07] <%Deft_Thought> This dude needs glasses
[2:05:09] <shadytreeofknowledge> 30 buck anybody member the name of the card game that your mom played
[2:05:15] <$birchpeninsula> Glad to hear you're liking it! I haven't been watching the VODs yet, is Solus the best or is he the best?
[2:05:17] <ZaDoorman> this guy looks like a Great Value brand Speedwagon to me for some reason.
[2:05:21] <%demegodz> Yeah super smoof

[2:05:23] <%Yadogari> It's great
[2:05:25] <shadytreeofknowledge> pat dickgioh

[2:05:38] <+Flambage> @AngriestPat Would you still love Elmo if he turned into a Lalafell?
[2:05:53] <%king_wragles> Answer the question.
[2:05:54] <%spiritofmojave> when he said varnish I immediately thought if the smell of shined shoes
[2:06:00] <+Promessa_EX> wood working is fun, i wish i had the right tools for it
[2:06:03] <VeryTricky> this MMO plays well with a controller? zanamaThink
[2:06:07] <alrobot2014> yep
[2:06:08] <adamisfruit> Freshly sanded wooden dildo
[2:06:19] <alrobot2014> designed with ps3/4 in minds
[2:06:19] <%king_wragles> Wait, Ronzo?
[2:06:20] <GarbageQueenEllie> @Flambage No one should ever have to answer that question. EVER
[2:06:20] <$birchpeninsula> It's out on PS4, so yeah.
[2:06:28] <shadytreeofknowledge> that sounds hurty
[2:06:32] <%moondog_> @flambage as long as Elmo still has the bag. of course Pat would love a potato
[2:06:46] <%Deft_Thought> Are the catfolk just the Ronso from FFX
[2:06:56] <$birchpeninsula> Pat is a large real life lalafell, anyway
[2:07:00] <shadytreeofknowledge> he is a literal Mr. Potatoe head
[2:07:06] <$birchpeninsula> So of course he'd love Elmofell
[2:07:10] <VeryTricky> sounds comfy to farm stuff while laid back instead of upright over a keyboard cirComfy
[2:07:15] <GarbageQueenEllie> That npc is going to go Jeryk off now
[2:07:28] <shadytreeofknowledge> jerk jerk jerk
[2:07:34] <$birchpeninsula> @GarbageQueenEllie boo

[2:08:02] <%VantomPayne> WE FAAAAAAALL
[2:08:02] <%spiritofmojave> LUL
[2:08:06] <+NeoRider247> For a moment I thought Pat was swinging the Buster Sword around
[2:08:07] <Sol_Install> WE FALL]
[2:08:15] <shadytreeofknowledge> did pat get fucking taller?
[2:08:20] <$birchpeninsula> I mean it's not far off from the buster sword
[2:08:21] <%doc_ock_rokc> That dude did a Sick jump over pat's head
[2:08:28] <GarbageQueenEllie> Why does Final Fantasy land need trains and motorcycles? Can't they teleport or something?
[2:08:35] <+projectmanatees> fall damage big scare
[2:08:40] <shadytreeofknowledge> not that high a jump tho like 2feet
[2:08:42] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat so since your chocobo fights with you... is there a chance you can get the car to fight with you?
[2:08:48] <%doc_ock_rokc> @GarbageQueenEllie teleportation is expensive
[2:08:54] <Thalchampz> i think teleport is exclusive to people with huge amount of aether
[2:09:00] <+HarryWizard> ..Does his bird have LITERAL horse armor?
[2:09:03] <$birchpeninsula> Not so much expensive, but exhausting
[2:09:04] <%king_wragles> Damn
[2:09:09] <alrobot2014> yes it does
[2:09:09] <CalderGaming> how's everyone doing on this week of Catching Up On VODs From SGDQ And CEO2019
[2:09:11] <$birchpeninsula> Sucks their magic energies out
[2:09:14] <shadytreeofknowledge> ron simmons
[2:09:19] <alrobot2014> the horse armor is fabulous
[2:09:19] <GarbageQueenEllie> That makes sense. Plus, road trips are great
[2:09:22] <+HarryWizard> 10/10
[2:09:31] <%Diabetic> but why
[2:09:41] <%king_wragles> it's to protect his bird hooves of course!
[2:09:47] <$birchpeninsula> Pat, you need to get back up
[2:10:00] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Diabetic Its so inbred it has hooves
[2:10:03] <shadytreeofknowledge> @HarryWizard you're a Wizard Harry but @AngriestPat is the Shit Lord now n forever
[2:10:11] <alrobot2014> the chicken is getting involved in some big battles it needs armor
[2:10:11] <RedAhoge> quick question how is shadowbringers so far, cuz im poor
[2:10:12] <majindusto> Chocobo's are Horse-Birds after all
[2:10:17] <%Diabetic> @doc_ock_rokc At least they kept it in the family
[2:10:23] <%Tenebrae94> do you use cloud's bike for a bit pat?
[2:10:38] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat just let us fuck with Diabetic a bit more
[2:10:43] <RedAhoge> jealousy overflowing
[2:10:44] <CalderGaming> is this still the First?
[2:10:45] <%Tenebrae94> ah
[2:10:45] <shadytreeofknowledge> Ron White is underrated
[2:10:50] <alrobot2014> this is the first
[2:10:51] <mayorrev> Cloud's bike can fly
[2:10:52] <GarbageQueenEllie> Chocobos are at least kinda cute, whereas Ostriches and Emus are ugly as sin
[2:10:54] <majindusto> BibleThump
[2:10:55] <%Tenebrae94> 30!?
[2:11:00] <%king_wragles> anyway @Diabetic chocoboes in this game have hoove hands
[2:11:04] <+projectmanatees> is healer still the easiest spot to get in dutys?
[2:11:05] <$shadow1man9> Finished the story earlier today, can confirm the story is better than HW's
[2:11:05] <shadytreeofknowledge> he played ff14 well he started and got drunk
[2:11:05] <+StrawberryPantsu> It's not fair bros 8.2 was supposed to kill this game :^)
[2:11:06] <Thalchampz> cloud's bike is expensive
[2:11:11] <alrobot2014> you can tell by the endless light in the sky and in the distance which has consumed buildings
[2:11:13] <CalderGaming> I didn't expect it to have a region that looked so not-weird
[2:11:17] <shadytreeofknowledge> fuck lightning
[2:11:24] <majindusto> It's a Cool Bike tho
[2:11:27] <$birchpeninsula> The worst part is, the bike is apparently faster than other mounts as well (when you don't have the mount speed upgrades for an area)
[2:11:33] <%sshen> but it's still 30 dollars
[2:11:33] <shadytreeofknowledge> the character not the natural element
[2:11:35] <%king_wragles> @Diabetic actual answer: it has something to do with how Odin has a horse. I'm a bit short on details.
[2:11:40] <Pukenasty> that's a lot of money for a mount
[2:11:50] <%Diabetic> @king_wragles I can accept that, however, now they have female galka, do they still give birth by eggs?
[2:12:00] <GarbageQueenEllie> Odin's horse has like seven legs or some shit. That's pretty spoopy
[2:12:01] <$birchpeninsula> The mounts and cast shop clothes are pretty expensive in this game
[2:12:03] <%sshen> Least it's not like WoW with the £60 mounts
[2:12:07] <majindusto> God Dammit Square-Enix
[2:12:10] <%king_wragles> uh....sure @Diabetic . Those are words
[2:12:27] <%VioletHeart> Just did the last dungeon of 4.x. Shadowbringers here we come.
[2:12:30] <ZaDoorman> @pukenasty listen... people REALLY love FF7, there is a market for people who like FF7 stuff
[2:12:31] <Mr_Strut> Why does the chocobo have horse legs?
[2:12:34] <%Diabetic> Galka are whatever they call the big people Pat is playing in FFXI
[2:12:43] <$birchpeninsula> You know you love it, though
[2:12:43] <shadytreeofknowledge> why does
[2:12:52] <Pukenasty> to each his own i suppose
[2:13:19] <%Lapinelis> Pat, do you appreciate that lalas are a beast tribe here, aka not actual people in the first
[2:13:21] <$birchpeninsula> So I just realized, there's a severe lack of cube on this stream
[2:13:33] <%NWR_James> Gotta step out to eat big foods. You get big huge and make sure to use your dumb car in places where it looks stupid!
[2:14:01] <Zebroneath> Why does this sound like Dark Cloud all of a sudden?
[2:14:09] <+StrawberryPantsu> That guys outfit is dope
[2:14:12] <+StrawberryPantsu> I want it
[2:14:52] <Vohs_Bru> eat the ROCKS!

[2:15:25] <Zombrocom> These quest names though
[2:15:32] <$birchpeninsula> @shadytreeofknowledge Pat is the "adorable little sapling", though
[2:15:38] <+Mr_FruitzNutz> oh nice buster sword
[2:15:58] <Vohs_Bru> romantic stone fists on a stick
[2:16:24] <Overloard> SourPls
[2:16:36] <%AuksMattin> @AngriestPat hey Pat! how long do you plan on going tonight?
[2:16:50] <$birchpeninsula> So I'm pretty sure that enemy is literally just a pile of rocks, there's no body under the ground. So why would it make a face for itself instead of just, like a third fist?
[2:17:09] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat they go down at like 1 est cuz the time was posted in pst not est
[2:17:09] <$Yakobro> but we're the sapling
[2:17:18] <%Deft_Thought> Reminds me of those Dragon Quest rock dudes
[2:17:26] <+Mr_FruitzNutz> how do we know its rocks, it coule be petrified poop

[2:18:39] <LowTierSupport> When are you going to eat a hot pepper you coward?
[2:18:40] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat I can't believe you shot him dead
[2:18:44] <acearan> He looked so serene
[2:18:51] <%AncelDeLambert> Who shot Hannibal?
[2:18:55] <$shadow1man9> Someday tank queues will be back to normal. Someday
[2:18:58] <%AuksMattin> lol confirmed live murder LUL
[2:19:00] <+StrawberryPantsu> Ya Grazed him
[2:19:02] <Sol_Install> for now lets get this rock rolling
[2:19:02] <%demegodz> He killed him like a Yakuza game
[2:19:10] <+Promessa_EX> Not a plot bullet
[2:19:14] <Vohs_Bru> juice the juice
[2:19:14] <eco419> He is just gagged in a truck
[2:19:16] <%demegodz> Not dead
[2:19:17] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat is like Kiryu, never killed nobody
[2:19:21] <%shurtal> is there a japanese myth thing about a head and two hands sticking out of the ground? cause i'm thinking back and can come up with like 9 different versions of that enemy in japanese games...
[2:19:22] <VioletHeart> Tank queues aren't bad now to be fair.
[2:19:22] <$birchpeninsula> The name of the mission is down for maintenance. But screw that, the other mission is "Scavengers Assemble"
[2:19:25] <VioletHeart> 5-10 minutes usually.
[2:19:30] <+StrawberryPantsu> Rejoice
[2:19:39] <VioletHeart> Still a lot worse than usual and healers are the most desired class, but it's mellowed out.
[2:19:46] <+StrawberryPantsu> I just started tanking and have no intention on going back to DPS
[2:19:52] <%spiritofmojave> regular tank quenues will return once all the bad GNB give up
[2:19:56] <$birchpeninsula> No new healer but a new tank and a new DPS does that
[2:19:59] <%demegodz> @AncelDeLambert How else would be the legendary Dragon of Dogema
[2:20:03] <CalderGaming> @birchpeninsula that's making me think about how you would have to pronounce "scavengers" for that to scan and, ow,
[2:20:15] <+StrawberryPantsu> 25-30 min
[2:20:15] <+valkuma> DPS is like 8-15 minutes lately.
[2:20:15] <%Yadogari> 9 minutes is a FAST DPS queue
[2:20:17] <%spiritofmojave> the alliance one ain't great iirc
[2:20:32] <%Fidel_Castbro> You're crazy pat
[2:20:35] <+valkuma> i havent had a DPS queue over 15min and average 8min
[2:20:38] <%schlager087> Does FFXIV require subscription on top of PS4 Online?
[2:20:38] <%Fidel_Castbro> DPS queues don't go higher than 10 right now
[2:20:42] <Vohs_Bru> the hills have amber eyes
[2:20:44] <+Blackmage9999> I love being a healer wait times of like no more then 2 min
[2:20:51] <%terminallyCapriciousz> @schlager087 yes
[2:20:54] <$birchpeninsula> @CalderGaming how do you pronounce scavenger if it's not like avengers with extra at the start?
[2:20:58] <ZaDoorman> no
[2:20:59] <alrobot2014> nope 14 is independent of ps plus
[2:21:02] <JoshTheFace> no
[2:21:02] <TsundereFFXIV> you dont need PS+
[2:21:05] <%Jarvanii> pat's right
[2:21:09] <+datmegamandeeeee> No
[2:21:14] <Zebroneath> You don't need PS+, but you still need the FF14 subscription.
[2:21:18] <+Fynale> if the game is free or has it's own sub it doesn't require ps+
[2:21:26] <%schlager087> word word, thanks guys
[2:21:26] <+datmegamandeeeee> U dont need ps+
[2:21:31] <+valkuma> birchpeninsula because the first letters decide the pronunciation not the last letters.
[2:21:34] <Mattcowdisease6> do you play through the ps4 or use a ps4 controller for the pc?
[2:21:39] <切捨御免> SUDDENLY VOICED
[2:21:42] <CalderGaming> @birchpeninsula SCAvengers vs. aVENgers
[2:21:48] <acearan> If you need ps+ I owe sony alot of money
[2:22:01] <%king_wragles> @切捨御免 it be like that sometimes
[2:22:07] <CalderGaming> say "scaVENgers assemble" and behold
[2:22:08] <ZaDoorman> XIV is like F2P games on PSN, you don't need PS+ to play them. you only need a membership for XIV.
[2:22:20] <DRAGKUDO> Is that Adam Howden?!!
[2:22:48] <%schlager087> unfortunately i think i'll have to wait like 10 years before I'll have enough time to play it lol
[2:23:00] <$birchpeninsula> Oh, that's what you mean. Sure, it's not the same emphasis on the same syllables, but it's the same pronunciation, no?
[2:23:07] <%spiritofmojave> as you do
[2:23:10] <%shurtal> foot in mouth
[2:23:12] <worldbrand> water towers are built for that
[2:23:24] <+TripleHelix> Sad drunk kitty FeelsBadMan
[2:23:30] <%demegodz> Wow that accent
[2:23:35] <SailingSaturn> @Belutima cirPat
[2:23:44] <$birchpeninsula> Also on the subcsription in addition to PS+, apparently that's a reason why the game's not on Xbox, in addition to some others.
[2:23:48] <Jeemukun> is he trying to be scottish?
[2:23:49] <%Deft_Thought> apatElmo
[2:23:50] <meteor530> Wow time to turn this bastard into a pelt
[2:23:51] <%sshen> Trouble with the trolley eh?
[2:23:54] <$birchpeninsula> And yeah, the accents have been wild this expansion
[2:24:02] <Vohs_Bru> me wife you beast
[2:24:02] <%shurtal> that accent is like a cross between Peter Stormare and Ranier von Wolfcastle
[2:24:04] <%king_wragles> The bunny girls are Scottish... the lion bois are Scottish.... WHO ISN'T SCOTTISH?
[2:24:05] <%demegodz> @Jeemukun Possibly...we will never know
[2:24:09] <KatabolicRage> good thing she's dead or we'd have to see a female ronso in this no girls allowed race
[2:24:10] <Thalchampz> FeelsBadMan
[2:24:10] <CalderGaming> wow auron really let go
[2:24:21] <SailingSaturn> @king_wragles I thought they were Icelandic? cirISee
[2:24:24] <Jeemukun> so there are big lady cats
[2:24:31] <%demegodz> Bunny Girls are Irish and the Catboys Scottish
[2:24:35] <+Promessa_EX> my sorrows they learned to swim
[2:24:36] <$birchpeninsula> @KatabolicRage his wife was obviously a lalafell
[2:24:37] <meteor530> Have you tried a KEG?
[2:24:38] <Vohs_Bru> lost me dick
[2:24:47] <+valkuma> i lost my robes and wizard hat
[2:24:49] <$birchpeninsula> Kappa
[2:24:49] <%king_wragles> @SailingSaturn I dunno, I'm barely able to tell accents apart
[2:24:52] <+PunishedMercer_> you'll never be a big muscled cat lady, why live
[2:24:55] <%Gogogolem> Its hard to take this kitty mans sadness seriously
[2:25:08] <GarbageQueenEllie> Pffffft
[2:25:13] <KatabolicRage> that fuckin gobbue rampage man, a lot of shit seems to go back to this
[2:25:14] <Zebroneath> Please don't do a Narancia on us, Thancred.
[2:25:20] <%Deft_Thought> Lookit that lil potatoe run
[2:25:23] <%demegodz> I robbed a young girl
[2:25:24] <SailingSaturn> @king_wragles I think they're trying to imitate Fran and ff12 viera cirISee
[2:25:30] <VioletHeart> Those good ole' 1.0 cutscenes.
[2:25:41] <stormingryocan220> This wkuld be a blast taking a
[2:25:51] <KatabolicRage> real ironic comin from you thancred, king of baggage
[2:25:58] <Vohs_Bru> he is sad the he did not get to be in Wing Commander
[2:26:09] <%king_wragles> @SailingSaturn maybe, or it could be just how they sound. Like how Khajiit are vaguely Persian sounding
[2:26:09] <%Gogogolem> Remember when thancred was just drunk for an entire expansion
[2:26:09] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@meteor530) (warning)
[2:26:10] <stormingryocan220> this would be a blast when taking drinks watching this
[2:26:17] <GarbageQueenEllie> Stop drinking your feelings, you cat bastard
[2:26:18] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> @AngriestPat happy Canada day Pat
[2:26:32] <%Afterman_> BibleThump
[2:26:37] <$birchpeninsula> Good man, Pat

[2:26:43] <worldbrand> censor that
[2:26:44] <KatabolicRage> headpats
[2:26:47] <mayorrev> headpat
[2:26:47] <%Tenebrae94> who?
[2:26:48] <%demegodz> pat pat
[2:26:49] <%spiritofmojave> Mini filia is better anyway
[2:26:52] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> pat pat
[2:27:00] <$birchpeninsula> This one has done so much more already, I wanna keep her.
[2:27:03] <stormingryocan220> Big Pats
[2:27:05] <%Deft_Thought> What?
[2:27:07] <alrobot2014> what if the two merged?
[2:27:10] <%Gogogolem> Thancred touched the sploosh button now hes going to jail.
[2:27:16] <+StrawberryPantsu> Kicked?
[2:27:17] <切捨御免> nani
[2:27:19] <KatabolicRage> pat... pat what are you doing at this time of day
[2:27:20] <eco419> Wut?
[2:27:28] <GarbageQueenEllie> What if all the Minfilias started furiously making out
[2:27:30] <dredshift> I swear that background chanting is saying "hidey ho"
[2:27:37] <+StrawberryPantsu> No?
[2:27:39] <+VashyronM> no
[2:27:42] <worldbrand> guess not
[2:27:43] <Thalchampz> i don't think so
[2:27:44] <%terminallyCapriciousz> Nope
[2:27:45] <+valkuma> no all the facial hair is horrendous looking
[2:27:49] <$birchpeninsula> ot
[2:27:52] <%terminallyCapriciousz> ""Coming soon""" TM
[2:27:53] <worldbrand> ahahahahahaha
[2:27:54] <D0ct0r22> the background is actually saying "Tiny Horse"
[2:27:55] <$birchpeninsula> It's not great
[2:27:57] <KatabolicRage> short answer no, you go highlander if you want real facial hair
[2:27:58] <+StrawberryPantsu> The stubble one
[2:27:59] <snowmanse> No, which is weird because they showed it in an in-game trailer footage
[2:28:01] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> It looks like a Titan holy shit
[2:28:01] <+StrawberryPantsu> benchmark
[2:28:04] <KUYAmoPESh> WHat's Awefull?!!
[2:28:05] <alrobot2014> that really was a crazy thought to have right at that moment
[2:28:20] <%spiritofmojave> God forbid there be decent beards in this
[2:28:22] <KUYAmoPESh> Yeeaaaahh!
[2:28:23] <Smart_ZaK1> The beard options are not very good
[2:28:24] <ZaDoorman> @birchpeninsula Another reason XIV supposedly isn't on X1 is because Xbox has some weird policy where 1) They HAVE to have a Gold membership and 2) the wanted it so you can turn off cross-play and only play with xbox people, which obviously doesn't work for XIV.
[2:28:27] <GarbageQueenEllie> Minfilia selfcest when
[2:28:33] <+StrawberryPantsu> Fuck YOU HROTHGAR LOOK GREAT
[2:28:40] <Thalchampz> WOW
[2:28:41] <bestwaifuritsu> Fucking stupid
[2:28:42] <+StrawberryPantsu> But yeah that's dumb
[2:28:43] <KatabolicRage> you chose the wrong time to log out dude, you should've just booted up the benchmark side by side with the real game
[2:28:43] <meteor530> Oh that sucks
[2:28:46] <+valkuma> oh no
[2:28:47] <%Yadogari> LUL
[2:28:47] <%Deft_Thought> The fuck
[2:28:48] <%snow_bush> SHOW ME THE TAIL
[2:28:51] <alrobot2014> pat is viera voice 7 still fucked
[2:28:52] <worldbrand> whuhy
[2:28:54] <+valkuma> its because theyre too muscly to stand up straight
[2:28:56] <$birchpeninsula> @ZaDoorman yeah.
[2:28:57] <+ner0romanov> they should have been ronso
[2:29:00] <%Gogogolem> yeah the hrothgar are terrible and i am sad about it.
[2:29:00] <%Deft_Thought> Man, I wanted Kimahri not this weird hunched over shit
[2:29:04] <KatabolicRage> oh that queu isn't the worst I've seen
[2:29:04] <%Afterman_> oh god hunched like wow orcsw
[2:29:05] <VioletHeart> I think the hunch is great.
[2:29:05] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> Ronso are better
[2:29:05] <GarbageQueenEllie> We'll call it Multifilia
[2:29:05] <+AverageBlubber> I like the hunch, but would prefer no tail
[2:29:08] <VioletHeart> Makes them look more bestial.
[2:29:09] <ItIsSky> Hrothgar are buff palico prove me wrong
[2:29:11] <%spiritofmojave> some of the Viera ears are ass
[2:29:14] <%Afterman_> im so glad im an au ra @AngriestPat
[2:29:16] <$birchpeninsula> How about Viera voice 9?
[2:29:18] <+valkuma> SCH will still be broken FeelsBadMan
[2:29:24] <$birchpeninsula> That one was fucked too, right?
[2:29:29] <+phamchri> wait what bug?
[2:29:31] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat Its like square enix was resentful they had to put in an ugly race into their supermodel simulator.
[2:29:31] <%Dwarven_Gaming> i want viera voice 9 to stay
[2:29:34] <%Afterman_> i have been
[2:29:40] <%spiritofmojave> yes
[2:29:40] <%Afterman_> whats the bug?
[2:29:48] <%Sasquatch_John> I switched to a Lion dude and I dig them
[2:29:58] <$birchpeninsula> That sounds amazing
[2:29:58] <alrobot2014> because it was clipping into their tails?
[2:30:06] <TioXyco> vibrate the nuts?
[2:30:11] <%Afterman_> the sword i have equipped now as a drk does not, but im only 55 @AngriestPat
[2:30:16] <%Yadogari> Vibrate their nuts?
[2:30:21] <alrobot2014> why is there a naked man
[2:30:22] <GarbageQueenEllie> Minfillia needs to assemble with her other counterparts to form a MinfilliaZord
[2:30:28] <bestwaifuritsu> I still cant get over how stupid Urianger looks wearing a wifebeater
[2:30:31] <Prism_Wing> It's a HF Blade, Pat Kappa
[2:30:32] <Zombrocom> So what happens if you pick one of the other two options besides the trolley? Is this all optional?
[2:30:40] <%Maids4lyfe> I'd pay to see a MinfilliaZord
[2:30:46] <%Afterman_> @AngriestPat ill send you a pic of it on twitter
[2:30:46] <Sol_Install> brb
[2:30:47] <%spiritofmojave> it clips with the deathbringer glam I have for sure
[2:30:54] <$valriot> Male AuRa are for people who like Bleach
[2:30:58] <$birchpeninsula> Probably not optional, I'd assume they'd tell you the other ideas are stupid
[2:31:11] <VioletHeart> It's nice to see you rocking a roe though, Pat. They're neat.
[2:31:20] <worldbrand> you get a HF blade for free
[2:31:22] <bestwaifuritsu> male au ra are for people too insecure in themselves to play female au ra
[2:31:24] <GarbageQueenEllie> Go go Smol Link Rangers, Mighty Morphin' Minnie Rangers
[2:31:24] <VioletHeart> All the roe emotes are dorky and it's cute.
[2:31:41] <+Promessa_EX> ribbed vibrating blades for her pleasure
[2:31:44] <+TheImmortal70> Old man Pat shakes his fist at the stream, talking about vibrators
[2:31:48] <%demegodz> Welp, time for lunch break
[2:31:50] <%demegodz> brb
[2:31:54] <%Afterman_> @AngriestPat yeah i see what you mean, it does kind of do it
[2:31:57] <Thalchampz> we need more roes, if i ever play anything than a male hyur, would be a female roe
[2:32:26] <$birchpeninsula> Wouldn't hurt to drop them a bug report about it, I guess
[2:32:31] <%Lapinelis> I'd normally play roe, but I like casters and roe casters look stupid
[2:32:32] <DeathGodSkeith> my viera is FUCKIN AWESOME
[2:32:34] <+Jin_XIV> I've been playing an Au Ra DRK for years and now I will never unsee that, thanks NotLikeThis

[2:32:40] <$OmegaWeltall> alsong as it not one of them wierdo ERPing Cats or lizards... man im so sick of them
[2:32:42] <+valkuma> Roe look weird as anything but warriors or DRK
[2:32:49] <+valkuma> BTTV EMOTES?

[2:36:59] <+TheImmortal70> Podcast ended early

[2:37:00] <%rumtumtugnutz> Hard bum pee
[2:37:01] <alrobot2014> had a short podcast so he decided to stream
[2:37:02] <%Tenebrae94> so on the psn store do i chose the online free trail?
[2:37:07] <meteor530> I tried the game a while ago and it gave a time based trial. Is there another way to play without playing?
[2:37:15] <meteor530> paying
[2:37:24] <VioletHeart> The trial is level based.
[2:37:24] <CrimsonGargoyle> SourPls
[2:37:25] <%theturtlebar> Free trial is indefinite, limited to lv 35
[2:37:25] <MasterDecoder> @theturtlebar Podcast ended earlier than he thought
[2:37:25] <+ElMangoes> play without playing moon2POGGYWOGGY
[2:37:26] <VioletHeart> So there should be.
[2:37:28] <Calek> this game is free to play forever up to level 35
[2:38:06] <%Ranryu692> yeah but to actually download it you have to pay $20
[2:38:16] <+Promessa_EX> is an early ended podcast still 3+ hours
[2:38:19] <dama2046> You can still keep playing when you hit the 35 quest right? Just not progress?
[2:38:36] <+projectmanatees> any difference in the grand company or is it just a preference?
[2:38:45] <%Ranryu692> you stop gaining experience, but you can do as many classes as you want up to 35
[2:38:48] <%GummiBunnies> guess i can see if ffxiv fits with me before i start taking out sub money for it lol
[2:39:03] <%Ranryu692> 36 is where cool stuff starts to happen
[2:39:36] <%Faustgesicht> hey what'd i miss?
[2:41:10] <Vohs_Bru> Pat is taking a dukee
[2:41:10] <thegreenbenis> OOF

[2:41:22] <meteor530> Or he fell into the toilet and is having a freakout
[2:41:29] <thegreenbenis> ^
[2:41:47] <%spiritofmojave> probably wouldn't be the first time
[2:42:06] <thegreenbenis> Hey why are anime grills with big ole eyebrows the besT?
[2:42:11] <thegreenbenis> best*
[2:42:34] <Prism_Wing> @thegreenbenis Because you taste the meat, not the heat.
[2:42:36] <Buttku> he shat out a small child last time, wonder what he's gonna push out this time
[2:43:00] <Vohs_Bru> THE BABY
[2:43:00] <$Yakobro> @projectmanatees they have gear sets with different looks, but you can swap later
[2:43:00] <+Promessa_EX> i love mugi
[2:43:05] <CrimsonGargoyle> @thegreenbenis because it protects their eyes from sweat, and everyone loves an efficient anime waifu
[2:43:16] <%mistersups> Worst Moment incoming
[2:43:20] <%Sasquatch_John> @AngriestPat the worst part about the Hrothgar that I realize now that I switched to them is that most headgear just doesn't show up for them, I want my Lion Warrior the have a badass helm god dammit.
[2:43:24] <CrimsonGargoyle> drink more redbull, that'll fix your stomach Kappa
[2:43:25] <thegreenbenis> YOUR HANDS ARE SO DIRTY @AngriestPat

[2:44:09] <%some_sunflowers> ProZD did a great eat all the oreos video
[2:44:12] <%some_sunflowers> It made me uncomfortable
[2:44:12] <mayorrev> @AngriestPat you ever try mint oreos?
[2:44:15] <%TysonPG> the amount of level 50 main quests are starting to get annoying to me at this point
[2:44:15] <BlacSoul> thins are best
[2:44:15] <%Ranryu692> Mega Stuf is the old double stuf
[2:44:20] <CrypticMochi> Fried double stuffed is death
[2:44:24] <thegreenbenis> Bruh quad stuffed
[2:44:27] <ExpressNode> Birthday Cake or Mint are my favorite oreos
[2:44:27] <%Cn_alpha_02> Red Velvet is best Oreo.

[2:45:54] <%TheSniperJoe> reward A Cheer shared Rewards to 25 others in Chat!
[2:46:07] <meteor530> Ahhh this games combat. So good.
[2:46:15] <%TysonPG> wow, thats a lot of nuts
[2:46:31] <+2sappy> THAT"S A LOT OF NUTS!
[2:46:36] <+valkuma> its a little slow
[2:46:38] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@bestwaifuritsu) (warning)
[2:46:43] <Tomschiii> its One of the parts i dont rlly like
[2:46:52] <Tomschiii> espeically after blade and souls
[2:46:53] <CrimsonGargoyle> @AngriestPat what do you love about the combat? can you elaborate? this is coming from someone that basically never played this
[2:47:23] <CrimsonGargoyle> i see, makes sense!
[2:47:23] <+valkuma> i love the movement part of it but the actual actions during combat are slooow
[2:47:28] <meteor530> It's more involed I'd say. In comparision to something like WoW
[2:47:37] <ZaDoorman> is that a straight up buster sword?
[2:47:42] <+SoundVoid> Why does your chocobo have raptor arms?
[2:47:43] <Buttku> Why, punch girl
[2:47:49] <%TysonPG> i wouldnt say its slow
[2:47:53] <+valkuma> i like the big fasts
[2:47:59] <%sirisvirus> I love new mch
[2:48:06] <bestwaifuritsu> tfw high skill speed samurai
[2:48:12] <lbrownthedestroyer> is that custom battle music?
[2:48:15] <%TysonPG> i mean i played ninja up to 50 and it starts to get to the point of constantly changing something up
[2:48:18] <%korth367> if u want fast play mnk
[2:48:20] <+valkuma> Bard is almost just right
[2:48:24] <Copperage> If they're basing it off of DRK I mean its a dude with a big sword how fast you want him to hit
[2:48:35] <%TysonPG> and then samurai is just doing stuff nonstop
[2:48:40] <shadytreeofknowledge> hello
[2:48:44] <+sixcubit> this game has such super high time to kill on bosses i frankly don't see why being a DPS is so desirable. Not Dying and Healing both happen so tangibly and instantly, but damage feels very slow no matter what
[2:48:50] <CrimsonGargoyle> sometimes i wish pat could use his hat like a throwing glaive
[2:48:52] <+StrawberryPantsu> Don't like DRKs animations
[2:48:57] <shadytreeofknowledge> yay back from time out the chair was cold
[2:48:57] <+valkuma> basically what Sixcubit said
[2:49:04] <+valkuma> that and no numbers on enemy health bars
[2:49:09] <+StrawberryPantsu> Like people cum over how cool Blood spillers is
[2:49:21] <Copperage> I like to see big explosions its why i play blm and smn
[2:49:25] <ChoculaUltra> has it been confirmed or de-confirmed if we're getting that 5'o'clock shadow(bringers) facial hair from the benchmark in game?
[2:49:27] <+TheImmortal70> Bloodspillers can be seen from like a mile away
[2:49:31] <shadytreeofknowledge> help your fellow nerd
[2:49:32] <DeathGodSkeith> @Copperage same
[2:49:33] <+StrawberryPantsu> But Fell Cleave>Royal Authority>Blood Spillers
[2:49:33] <bestwaifuritsu> drk animations are cool how the sword cuts the air and leaves a slash trail for a little bit, shits dope
[2:49:40] <+TheImmortal70> It shoots darkness high up in the air
[2:49:51] <Copperage> nin is up there now with the new spell animations
[2:50:07] <ChoculaUltra> ah damn, had a Fantasia set up for that and everything
[2:50:12] <meteor530> Ninja is what I want to learn but it seems overly complicated...
[2:50:13] <CrimsonGargoyle> gotta benchmark dat beard real good first! it's still in beta Kappa
[2:50:14] <+VashyronM> Fell Cleave is okay. It isn't my favorite though
[2:50:21] <TioXyco> pat gonna become a Midlander?
[2:50:27] <+Justlaxy> I get to start the 79 stuff finally
[2:50:29] <Copperage> its not that bad you just need to get used to the mudras
[2:50:31] <thegreenbenis> This music is fucking baller.
[2:50:37] <+valkuma> @meteor530 Nothing is going to be too complicated considering yo have to do movement mechanics while dpsing
[2:50:38] <Tomschiii> they should rlly Add a bunch of Beards
[2:51:04] <ChoculaUltra> freaking Conrad from Stormblood had a great beard too.
[2:51:10] <+valkuma> a bunch of beards that dont look like glued on pubes would be nice
[2:51:14] <CrimsonGargoyle> @AngriestPat if you could describe this game in 5 words or less what would it be
[2:51:16] <+Justlaxy> also I like my new ninja rotations very much.
[2:51:30] <mayorrev> dont u dare hurt the thicc cactuar
[2:51:36] <Copperage> mine are ctrl 1, 2, 3 so i can just 123 for suiton 3 1 2 for doton etc.

[2:56:47] <%kujofire990> just get past the quest for titan's dinner and the post arr till 2.4 and you're good
[2:56:49] <%king_wragles> YES

[2:57:22] <%GummiBunnies> OOF
[2:57:23] <+skylerpilot> FOREVER MSQ
[2:57:27] <goddamndavid> @AngriestPat from what i've read and seen and heard they severely cut a lot of things out of the battle system. I stopped playing a few months before Shadowthehedgehog expansion came out.
[2:57:30] <Calek> you can go to the wiki and see how many there are
[2:57:36] <+valkuma> Pro Tip: Jump potion. ARR/Pre-HW almost killed this game for me.
[2:57:41] <+StrawberryPantsu> Just keep banging away at 2.0
[2:57:42] <%Unlimited_> @TysonPG become a true legend for survivng mmo hell
[2:57:51] <+StrawberryPantsu> Gets better in HW
[2:57:56] <%TysonPG> im gonna go through this
[2:57:58] <+StrawberryPantsu> Then Better in SB
[2:58:04] <KatabolicRage> don't skip, the post ARR quest slog is real but it gets better
[2:58:05] <%TysonPG> itll kill me a little inside
[2:58:05] <+StrawberryPantsu> Then BETTER in ShB
[2:58:08] <%Bigdrifter210> i just hit HW last night
[2:58:08] <%TysonPG> but ima do it
[2:58:17] <CrimsonGargoyle> @AngriestPat did you ever give the dragon's dogma mmo a spin?
[2:58:24] <%rumtumtugnutz> HW is better than Stoirmbringers
[2:58:25] <%Faustgesicht> Strangely 2.x has some decently important stuff in it
[2:58:32] <%JGardner88> Funnily enough only reason I got into 14 is because FF13 had gotten me interested in ther series and it was the next one lmao
[2:58:41] <MasterDecoder> That random had a cool coat
[2:58:48] <bestwaifuritsu> ff13 was the one that got you into the series? oof
[2:59:11] <%sshen> 13 was my first FF game too
[2:59:11] <+Tuxadracles> FF 13 > 15 tho, it had good lore
[2:59:25] <+Tuxadracles> Also 13-2 and 13-3 were fun
[2:59:29] <dama2046> Uhuh, sure
[2:59:31] <CrimsonGargoyle> rock worms? poor rocks
[2:59:31] <arkv01> @Tuxadracles you gonna get lynched son
[2:59:35] <%Faustgesicht> FF12 was my first. Nearly wrote the entire thing off after playing 10
[2:59:37] <%chimaera24> 15 was actually fun to play
[2:59:46] <+Tuxadracles> @arkv01 its just a game LUL
[2:59:51] <+Estuko> I actually enjoyed Comrades lol
[3:00:17] <+valkuma> Split up : but thancred does nothing, and you do literally all the work

[3:00:46] <%Faustgesicht> @sshen so never
[3:00:52] <arkv01> 14 is eternal
[3:00:54] <arkv01> hell look at 11
[3:01:07] <+Andrizzleton> mmm double stuffed
[3:01:09] <arkv01> shits still running like a champ, at least in japan
[3:01:18] <%spiritofmojave> 11 is kicking with updates somehow yeah
[3:01:37] <%Afterman_> gnomes are taller than pat
[3:01:53] <%TysonPG> my first FF was going to be 15 but the PC version doesnt allow me to use my sound because they use some sort of outdated shit
[3:02:00] <%TysonPG> so now its 14
[3:02:00] <dama2046> Is that 11 mobile port actually coming out?
[3:02:12] <+valkuma> because Leonine means "Like a lion" and lions are yellow
[3:02:12] <%Typhaeon> Because lions are yellow?
[3:02:20] <CrimsonGargoyle> @AngriestPat that just means you can punch them in the balls easier, size matters both ways!
[3:02:21] <%salty_syd913> leo lion yellow probably
[3:02:35] <MasterDecoder> I'm glad I'm not the only one that thought of that
[3:02:40] <%Ranryu692> racist
[3:02:45] <+valkuma> aint it crazy how nature do that
[3:02:53] <%snow_bush> So today some other video pouted out that Worf is War orphan... War- orph Warph
[3:02:54] <%wolfofsound> I was going to guess the autism
[3:02:54] <CrimsonGargoyle> it do be like that
[3:03:06] <%wolfofsound> @snow_bush BOOO
[3:03:12] <%Faustgesicht> Fuckin valedictorian color theory shit in this chat
[3:03:27] <%Ranryu692> about to do my mastery rank 10 qualifier. wish me luck
[3:03:30] <%Afterman_> wandering knockers
[3:03:34] <+Andrizzleton> check out those knockers
[3:03:47] <mojokingizakku> those knockers aren't very big
[3:03:51] <%miguelrod777> tig ol knockers
[3:03:57] <Tomschiii> instead of doing the story, i am grinding for my zodiac weapon. whats wrong with me
[3:04:09] <%AnIcedCoffee> you're close
[3:04:09] <snowmanse> You are really close
[3:04:23] <$shadow1man9> You're pretty close
[3:04:29] <dredshift> How weird is it that you're at the end of the game and you're fighting goblins and gnomes and regular-ass animals?
[3:04:31] <%wolfofsound> Sounds like a stroke, but you do you
[3:04:32] <+poweruser> are you sure that's not a heart attack?
[3:04:33] <%spiritofmojave> eh it's several quests, not lengthy
[3:04:42] <bestwaifuritsu> you're not crazy for grinding your zodiac weapon, youre crazy if you dont go all the way
[3:04:47] <+valkuma> keep in mind these regular ass rock worms can probably solo Ifrit
[3:04:52] <+Misum> yeah you're close
[3:04:54] <%sshen> Im fighting myself buying the wedding shit for the mount and minions cause GOTTA CATCH EM ALL issues
[3:04:58] <+Misum> lots of story before though
[3:05:06] <zajoestar> many cutscenes
[3:05:14] <+Estuko> am I not able to heal other players if we're not in a party? :(
[3:05:25] <$Yakobro> LOL
[3:05:27] <snowmanse> Levels are game mechanics, not lore measures of strength
[3:05:33] <+valkuma> HE WOULD ONE SHOT IFRIT
[3:05:39] <dama2046> You can heal other players
[3:05:39] <+Williamld> Levels are not canon
[3:05:45] <%mistersups> Go all Randy on it
[3:05:45] <+TheImmortal70> The loch leech would become the new fire primal
[3:05:45] <worldbrand> the numbers dont lie
[3:05:47] <Thalchampz> the numbers don't lie
[3:05:48] <+CookieCutter007> BUT HE LOOKS COOL
[3:05:51] <%miguelrod777> game wise probaly lore wise no lol
[3:05:59] <%spiritofmojave> it pisses me off that fucking several deer can fuck up an eikon slayer
[3:06:08] <+Williamld> So bahamut is weaker than moggle mog?
[3:06:09] <$shadow1man9> Zenos had fake Echo bullshit and that was the lore reason
[3:06:12] <Tomschiii> @bestwaifuritsu not Sure if i want to continiue after i get it^^
[3:06:30] <%Faustgesicht> tbh tho, deer will kick the shit out of anything, even god
[3:06:32] <KatabolicRage> so what your saying is those miners you slapped upside the head back on the tracks can slay eikons solo
[3:06:32] <Overloard> that's for plot progression reasons
[3:06:33] <+Estuko> @dama2046 was trying to aim at a lad running away from a big tree thing and I couldn't heal :V I felt bad
[3:06:41] <+valkuma> the megalobat could kill ultima weapon
[3:06:42] <+TheImmortal70> He didn't have the fake echo until later on in the story when he kicked your ass
[3:06:42] <CrimsonGargoyle> rip ifrit LUL
[3:06:45] <%sshen> Bat of light
[3:06:48] <$Yakobro> @spiritofmojave we're not really a god of actual combat, most super hard encounters are 8 v 1, we just have magic light powers for magic problems
[3:06:59] <+StrawberryPantsu> My question is when are we getting the dance emote in the strip club at Eulmore
[3:07:01] <dredshift> But it takes a team of six to beat Ifrit. Does that mean he's actually level 26x6?
[3:07:04] <dama2046> I had one where a dude was doing a fate and getting slaughtered
[3:07:11] <Overloard> why they gotta do ifrit like that tho
[3:07:12] <%ArchimerDreatect> i had this same discussion about the ishgardian world mobs being able to kill bahamut
[3:07:13] <+valkuma> @dredshift no because you can solo ifrit now
[3:07:14] <dama2046> And I couldn't interfere?
[3:07:28] <%spiritofmojave> @yakobro sounds right, then again we haven't seen too much echo bullshit this xpac yet
[3:07:33] <dama2046> Felt kinda bad, cause I then beat the fate while he died
[3:07:37] <CrimsonGargoyle> this guitar riff is pretty slick, i wonder how many chicken nuggets it took to make
[3:07:39] <+VashyronM> Ifirit would win because he would just temper anything you put in front of him unless it had echo. If it has Echo, then Ifrit is fucked
[3:07:51] <%sshen> Could these bats beat omega and eureka
[3:07:57] <CrimsonGargoyle> LUL
[3:08:12] <Nina96> KonCha
[3:08:21] <$Yakobro> @spiritofmojave he's literally absorbing all the light aether from the lightwardens, and there's some SHIT later :p
[3:08:32] <VioletHeart> Yeah but Krile could probably beat Ifrit. Ifrit's lame.
[3:08:45] <%sshen> But Pat all bats have echo
[3:08:46] <+valkuma> what about Ultima Weapon then? I bet a Rock worm could solo Ultima Weapon
[3:08:53] <+StrawberryPantsu> I thought tempering only worked on Sentient beings like humans and beast tribesmen
[3:08:59] <%TysonPG> WAIT if story wise only your character has the echo and the other people with you are like side characters than doesnt that make your guy less important cuz they dont get tempered
[3:09:01] <CrimsonGargoyle> more like Penultima Weapon amirite gottem
[3:09:02] <+skylerpilot> Also Ifrit is an Eikon, the strength of an Eikon is widely variable based on the how it was summoned. Amount of crystals, available aether, faith of its summoners, etc
[3:09:02] <+Williamld> So by this logic a mosuito in garlemald is stronger than all of eorzea combined? @AngriestPat
[3:09:10] <+Williamld> mosquito
[3:09:14] <%Lapinelis> Ifrit doesn't really have a canon strength, does he? He's as strong as the amount of aether you give him
[3:09:22] <%Lapinelis> if you give himm a tripple a baterry
[3:09:25] <%Lapinelis> He'll suck
[3:09:35] <+valkuma> If the mosquito has an AOE attack he could probably 1 shot all of eorzea stacked on top of eachother.
[3:09:41] <CrimsonGargoyle> unless it's a duracell @Lapinelis Kappa
[3:09:45] <%titans_ace_jerid> So how is an MMO supposed to get around that ptoblem really?
[3:09:46] <%spiritofmojave> @yakobro Oh I'm aware, but it seems to have some toll to it. In the next area from Pat atm. It is still a leap though, you're right
[3:09:50] <%Faustgesicht> that mosquito will become the blood primal
[3:09:51] <VioletHeart> @TysonPG Tempering is a thing primals have to consciously do. There are parts of the game spent yelling at your friends to get out of the battle arena so they don't get tempered.
[3:09:52] <Ozmodyas> This talk is reminding me of that part in Spider Isekai where Kumoko fights the Fire Dragon
[3:09:52] <+TheImmortal70> Raubahn will get his other arm taken by that mosquito
[3:10:01] <%solomonpun> I mean by this logic, is Australasia just a high-level zone 'cus of the dangerous animals?
[3:10:06] <%wolfofsound> a minor?
[3:10:08] <%solomonpun> *austrailia
[3:10:08] <%Yadogari> She was a minor?
[3:10:08] <+valkuma> Yeah she used to be under 18 Kappa
[3:10:10] <alrobot2014> from miner to minor
[3:10:10] <bestwaifuritsu> LUL
[3:10:12] <$Yakobro> @spiritofmojave you have some REAL shit coming up ;)
[3:10:15] <mayorrev> SHE WAS A MINECRAFTER
[3:10:25] <randoli_spugoli> Who would win in a rap battle, ifrit or loch leech
[3:10:25] <+lucaflow> No wonder she sucked so hard
[3:10:26] <GarbageQueenEllie> Don't touch me, I'm a Miner
[3:10:27] <%TysonPG> ooh ok fair @VioletHeart
[3:10:33] <dredshift> Look at his collar clip
[3:10:34] <+lucaflow> No combat skills all gathering
[3:10:35] <%Deft_Thought> Thancred should magic away those neck tattoos
[3:10:36] <%Faustgesicht> a Min-crafter, if you will
[3:10:42] <%spiritofmojave> @yakobro I heard as much! Really excited actually
[3:10:46] <ExpressNode> A child working in the coal mine
[3:10:54] <+lucaflow> Good, they needed to
[3:11:02] <+VashyronM> @TysonPG Also, you character isn't the only one with the Echo. It's rare, but other people have it. You character is Hydelyn's Chosen, so you are just better than everyone else...cause you are the player character
[3:11:14] <+Andrizzleton> are these people bringing shadows?
[3:11:17] <trashkink> So this is shadowbringers? how is it so far?
[3:11:39] <%Lapinelis> @trashkink best expansion yet
[3:11:40] <$Yakobro> you won't
[3:11:41] <%king_wragles> Why is everyone so proper?
[3:11:43] <+Edrem> Thancred ticking off every death flag imagineable
[3:11:43] <GarbageQueenEllie> She's not gonna date you, dude. Sorry to break it to ya
[3:11:49] <dredshift> Why does Thancred have a belt on his neck

[3:14:45] <%Lapinelis> Lapinelis subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! eastern Europe says hi, enjoy the game. Got to credits today. Thanks for getting me back into it.
[3:15:05] <%king_wragles> @doc_ock_rokc you shouldn't art on an empty stomach! It's distracting, you'll lose focus!
[3:15:22] <thegreenbenis> Oh shit is that Paige?

[3:15:25] <%doc_ock_rokc> @king_wragles Its actually the opposite problem that is true
[3:15:39] <+Andrizzleton> >probably hornless
[3:15:48] <%dylin456> been awhile sense i played or watched this game it doesnt have a cash shop that ruins the game like wow right?
[3:15:51] <%king_wragles> No horn! No horn!
[3:15:57] <%TysonPG> @Bigdrifter210 already was told summoner so im on that road, DRG is another one i plan on doing soon though
[3:15:57] <GarbageQueenEllie> When he should be racist against potatoes
[3:16:09] <Shwepie> How far as Pat gotten into the MSQ?
[3:16:09] <%terminallyCapriciousz> The Cash Shop is pretty bad in FF14
[3:16:12] <VeryTricky> RIP BIg Puss

[3:16:42] <%TysonPG> @terminallyCapriciousz i mean the amount of level 50 quests
[3:16:42] <GarbageQueenEllie> No it's not. Genetics gives you a set code to deal with
[3:16:50] <%Gogogolem> I hate the cat people
[3:16:53] <+Estuko> random is being born in real life, but that dude LOST the draw
[3:16:56] <alrobot2014> genetics ain't pure rng, its rigged
[3:16:58] <%terminallyCapriciousz> Oh, you always have to do it once Tyson. You might as well just do it
[3:17:04] <%Gogogolem> As the catboy if he has toe beans.
[3:17:10] <+TheImmortal70> That's because it IS empty
[3:17:14] <mayorrev> actually paige it's more like taking both your mom's and dad's facial features and throwing them into a blender
[3:17:16] <+TheImmortal70> No aether, no life, no anything
[3:17:17] <GarbageQueenEllie> Teach him the ways of punting potatoes
[3:17:23] <%TysonPG> @terminallyCapriciousz yeah but its killing me so ima do something else and go back to it
[3:17:27] <%sshen> Theres a mount and minions locked behind a $40 wedding package
[3:17:38] <%Gogogolem> This is really awkward. I mean you're very sad about this thing i don't give a fuck about.
[3:17:40] <%dylin456> just dont like how the wow cash shop put buyable gold and toon boosts in the game dont so much care if they sell mounts or fashion items
[3:17:44] <%terminallyCapriciousz> I guess just try summoner then, tyson
[3:17:54] <dama2046> Cheapest marriage you'll ever have
[3:17:57] <aimlesshealer> I love your hat, Pat
[3:18:04] <%Gogogolem> does that catboy have silver poisoning why is he blue?

[3:18:52] <%Fidel_Castbro> and have your dead wife rock arm
[3:18:58] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat You know shes dead because everyone wanted female rothgar and if they put one in the game people would rage.
[3:19:03] <Jeemukun> made with 100% dead waifooze
[3:19:07] <Madbearv> stone handjobs
[3:19:11] <%Maids4lyfe> the rock killed his wife

[3:19:42] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 19m.
[3:19:44] <FalseEyeD> James Cameron agrees.
[3:19:44] <%doc_ock_rokc> Why don't they get a Rubbing of the Rock so that dead wife rock lives on
[3:19:52] <%Maids4lyfe> I want a bunny twink
[3:19:56] <%Gogogolem> Pretend to have a penis.
[3:20:00] <+Ell1ot> I want the bunny boys to all be BIG CHUNGUS
[3:20:06] <Jeemukun> think we might get bunny boy and cat ladies later on? or never ever?
[3:20:06] <VioletHeart> The real tragedy is the viera don't have floppy ears.
[3:20:08] <%doc_ock_rokc> Big Chungus
[3:20:11] <dredshift> Are there no Lalafell in the First? Is that why Pat loves it so much?

[3:20:29] <+VariantX7> the male viera are super models lol
[3:20:32] <snowmanse> Most of the men die from forest creatures, so maybe they are small.
[3:20:32] <VioletHeart> Viera males are supposed to be super athletic traveling hunters.
[3:20:33] <%Gogogolem> Half of those sexy bunny women are men.
[3:20:35] <mayorrev> bun bois are cute
[3:20:41] <+Estuko> @Gogogolem that's fine

[3:26:34] <+VashyronM> Palpatine*
[3:26:44] <%Faustgesicht> Emet's behind it all
[3:26:45] <%sshen> Ive noticed with this expansion that characters are much more emotive with each other and actually physically interact instead of goofy emoting feet away from each other
[3:26:53] <%Afterman_> emet is the best
[3:26:59] <%Ranryu692> Super Friends really ruined Aquaman's reputation forever
[3:27:03] <%Ranryu692> even though he's pretty cool
[3:27:07] <%Afterman_> is he tho
[3:27:12] <+valkuma> PSA for everyone in chat playing this, make sure to chat with the quest NPC's (especially Emet) after cutscenes.
[3:27:14] <Madbearv> he is
[3:27:15] <%Gogogolem> I thought he came back
[3:27:21] <Madbearv> god damnit
[3:27:29] <$Yakobro> pat he is dead

[3:27:39] <%spiritofmojave> SECRET A S C I A N MAN
[3:27:41] <%Gogogolem> are you sure though?
[3:27:43] <+valkuma> His shoulder is made of crystal what do you expect
[3:27:43] <%Valdorick> Is he also a Light Ascian!?
[3:27:54] <%Maids4lyfe> lol
[3:27:59] <+Ell1ot> but sometimes people are only kinda dead and not hella dead
[3:28:01] <%Faustgesicht> Tear that hood off, Emet
[3:28:03] <MasterDecoder> Big Villain Energy
[3:28:13] <Seraphile> @valkuma like emet mention/admits that all the ascians are tempered
[3:28:13] <Zombrocom> Nah, there is no way he's that guy
[3:28:15] <+TheImmortal70> The last one he got EATEN
[3:28:19] <%Maids4lyfe> DIDN'T SEE A BODY
[3:28:21] <+Edrem> I think he's just applying he has some ascian powers
[3:28:29] <+VashyronM> Someone must have collected the Dragon Balls
[3:28:30] <+lucaflow> He had no body to see!
[3:28:34] <%Diabetic> "You got a zit right there man. I can't even look at you."

[3:33:25] <%Faustgesicht> LUL
[3:33:26] <Madbearv> pat's right
[3:33:27] <zajoestar> D:
[3:33:28] <%titans_ace_jerid> We call this the one THE FUCK SHELL, sir.
[3:33:28] <%Gogogolem> That Bullet if filled with my unrequited love.
[3:33:29] <mar_krow> We call it big bang
[3:33:32] <+VashyronM> "Let me help you, even though you are a massive dick and treat me like garbage."
[3:33:33] <%Afterman_> thancred dies. then we get micro and minifilia BOTH back
[3:33:34] <Belutima> He ALREADY tripped allot of Deathflags, LUL
[3:33:37] <%Afterman_> micro and macro*
[3:33:37] <+killer_squid1990> Pat wrong way
[3:33:42] <+Edrem> His bullet is the bullet that will pierce the heavens
[3:33:47] <+killer_squid1990> oh right wayt
[3:33:48] <+Williamld> Still less annoying than Y'shtola
[3:33:49] <Thenuclearwalrus> 1.0!
[3:33:50] <+killer_squid1990> Nevermind Im dumb
[3:33:53] <%Gogogolem> Its been like ten ingame years right?
[3:33:55] <KatabolicRage> the guy has this thing about minfilia
[3:33:56] <%RittiFruity> Mothe....er...I mean Minfiliaaaaaaaaah
[3:33:56] <+killer_squid1990> I'm dumb ignore me
[3:34:01] <Maverick2736> I mean, Pat's not wrong...
[3:34:01] <VioletHeart> *Also* five in-game years since he's been in the First for five.
[3:34:11] <GarbageQueenEllie> I've only seen the end of this arc, but I can just FEEL the asshollery off of that guy
[3:34:13] <+StrawberryPantsu> not like he would actually die on the first if he did
[3:34:15] <Thenuclearwalrus> Thancred has a complicated relationship with Minfilia
[3:34:19] <+Artemis_Scowl> Finally done with the slog of 100 quest to get to Ishgard! literally just finished up
[3:34:23] <+ozmodek> i still can't figure out if Thancred loves Minfilia like a daughter or lover
[3:34:23] <+valkuma> TANKCRED
[3:34:26] <%Yadogari> He just wants to smash
[3:34:29] <arkv01> minfillia fetish...
[3:34:30] <+Edrem> both
[3:34:32] <%Fidel_Castbro> you stop being a dick to Thancred
[3:34:34] <$Yakobro> @StrawberryPantsu it's basically their souls here, so he would
[3:34:36] <+ozmodek> i guess
[3:34:38] <$SleepyMaribo> Hry huys
[3:34:39] <%Gogogolem> Thancred, I am gonna need you stop being a bitch.
[3:34:40] <%spiritofmojave> m-mother--I mean daughter, I mean girlfriend
[3:34:40] <%Ninestempest> thancred is an edgy boi okay
[3:34:41] <+TheImmortal70> For old minfillia it was both
[3:34:44] <%Ninestempest> let him have his fake daughter
[3:34:45] <$SleepyMaribo> just hit lvl 80
[3:34:46] <Foggysheep> he wanted to smash but she isnt legal anymore
[3:34:48] <KatabolicRage> the real takeaway is this minfilia doesn't deserve to have to deal with his bullshit cos she has the same name and hair
[3:34:54] <+StrawberryPantsu> that butt window minfilia had though...
[3:34:56] <%Ninestempest> SHE WAS A GOOD MINER
[3:35:00] <%Ninestempest> THAT WAS IN 2.0
[3:35:01] <gekizenbu> its also a separate minfilia
[3:35:08] <Thenuclearwalrus> pRaY rEtUrN tO tHe wAkInG sAnDs
[3:35:17] <%Ninestempest> no now it is pray destroy the waking sands
[3:35:19] <+ozmodek> they confirm in this Minfilia's only job was literally Miner.
[3:35:19] <%Gogogolem> She got into a fight , she just got her ass beat so bad it was barely one.
[3:35:23] <%spiritofmojave> Pray DESTROY Waking Sands
[3:35:23] <%korth367> no ilvl sync
[3:35:25] <%Faustgesicht> cool so she was the FC crafter.
[3:35:33] <%Kirijuo> They literally made an april fools joke about how she did nothing and took all the credit
[3:35:54] <+TheImmortal70> NEEDST
[3:35:55] <FalseEyeD> The hair is super important though.
[3:35:58] <arkv01> nah man this is operation convert thancred into a lolicon
[3:35:58] <+StrawberryPantsu> cant wait for NG+ (I skipped all the HW cutscenes...)
[3:35:59] <Foggysheep> thou must needs

[3:46:13] <+valkuma> V A N I T Y
[3:46:16] <$Yakobro> @Jeemukun they started it last expansion
[3:46:18] <+natjen8> @Jeemukun yeah it started with the stormblood patch quests
[3:46:18] <%Gogogolem> Remember how you said you wanted hard skill checks to keep the bads out. Guess what Ranjit is
[3:46:19] <%Fatmanjoggin> big anime time
[3:46:19] <%korth367> YEYEYEYEYEYE

[3:46:41] <%salty_syd913> YOOOOOO
[3:46:42] <Jeemukun> neat, I dig the idea at least
[3:46:42] <+Estuko> OH SHIT

[3:46:52] <+Fynale> look at this monk dragoon
[3:47:02] <arkv01> actually what class is ranjit
[3:47:03] <+TheImmortal70> Gukumatz would literally get me to play Monk hands down
[3:47:03] <%Lapinelis> It's great but it takes forever
[3:47:07] <%Faustgesicht> awww pat's humming
[3:47:08] <+TheImmortal70> Ranjit is a SUPER monk
[3:47:12] <+Estuko> wait do you gotta wait for the attack animation to go away before moving in? Or just the attack MARKER
[3:47:12] <%wolfofsound> BANKAI
[3:47:19] <Jeemukun> also apparently this song has actual lyrics besides "we fall"
[3:47:19] <+Edrem> just the marker
[3:47:20] <+TheImmortal70> The marker
[3:47:23] <+Estuko> ooo
[3:47:25] <+TheImmortal70> Once marker is down you can move back at them
[3:47:28] <CrypticMochi> I wanna see fusion monks next expansion
[3:47:28] <$Yakobro> @Estuko just the cast bar/ground effect
[3:47:31] <%spiritofmojave> just the orange 99% the time
[3:47:42] <+VariantX7> guess we get to use the "plot bullet" here
[3:47:49] <$Yakobro> @Estuko once those go off it's safe, regarless of effects, unless it leaves a pool on the floor
[3:48:02] <+valkuma> god this fight is cool
[3:48:11] <+Estuko> Sorry for random questions, I'm doing the trial and just curious about diff mechanics. white mage :V
[3:48:16] <%Deft_Thought> UH OH

[3:48:25] <KoyFoster> RIP
[3:48:27] <+trez_> monkaS
[3:48:36] <arkv01> plot thing?
[3:48:38] <+TheImmortal70> Stop your HEART to hide
[3:48:40] <+valkuma> the tool tip for this reads "Hide oneself by stopping the flow of lifegiving aether"
[3:48:42] <gekizenbu> this is a sneaking mission thancred
[3:48:47] <ASleepySnek> oh like joatro
[3:48:48] <$Yakobro> @AngriestPat the tooltip says he's slowed his bodies aether to fucking nothing to hide, so it's killing him
[3:48:51] <worldbrand> NOW GUN
[3:48:51] <+VariantX7> did he stop his heart or some dumb shit??
[3:48:54] <marco39120> backstag
[3:48:56] <+VashyronM> Shoot her!
[3:48:58] <$Yakobro> @VariantX7 basically
[3:48:58] <Hellarussian> nothin personnel
[3:48:59] <marco39120> stab
[3:49:03] <%demegodz> STEALTH
[3:49:03] <+valkuma> YES
[3:49:04] <%Diabetic> Now use your stand to restart your heart
[3:49:06] <+valkuma> He literally stopped his heart
[3:49:10] <gekizenbu> @VariantX7 basically fucking up whats left of his magic/life force and his heart at the same time
[3:49:10] <%Deft_Thought> Damn, that was kinda intense
[3:49:10] <RedAhoge> wait it acknowledges the gunblade how is this MSQ
[3:49:13] <+Andrizzleton> the music coming back in tho
[3:49:16] <Jeemukun> this is so fucking anime in the best way
[3:49:17] <SailingSaturn> Worse his stopped his Aether flow cirBaka
[3:49:21] <+justianxix> this shit is so cool l
[3:49:21] <+TheImmortal70> He stopped his FF heart to prevent himself from being seen
[3:49:28] <%QuadraticGravity> The description of this ability is that he's cutting off his life aether to turn invisible, it's fucked
[3:49:31] <$SleepyMaribo> this is so anime!
[3:49:32] <%whiskey_wolfe_> This fight is so goddamn long.
[3:49:44] <FalseEyeD> Third of the way through now
[3:49:45] <+TheImmortal70> It's long but playing it is very good in the moment
[3:49:48] <%Deft_Thought> Man, these dads sure do know how to brawl
[3:49:50] <%AncelDeLambert> I can't wait for the next new job they add to this game: Keyblade Master
[3:49:55] <%AncelDeLambert> aren't you guys excited?
[3:50:05] <%Faustgesicht> so how chapter's is this fight?
[3:50:10] <+PunishedMercer_> heart darkness
[3:50:12] <+TheImmortal70> What?
[3:50:14] <+PunishedMercer_> light
[3:50:16] <$Kirby_Sauce> That looks zo dumb
[3:50:16] <SolGill> What track is this?
[3:50:19] <+valkuma> Ranjit is literally the Firsts' version of Thancred
[3:50:20] <+seaearthandsky> theres a lot of shit goin on in this fight
[3:50:30] <+lucaflow> Are you beating up the old man holy shit
[3:50:37] <RedAhoge> Kappa they show of the Scythe only to reveal the Keyblade class LUL
[3:50:42] <+TheImmortal70> Yeah Thancred is actually kinda winning too
[3:50:47] <CrypticMochi> Man, this is super there to keep out the bads
[3:50:48] <RedAhoge> oh GNB is story related
[3:50:48] <KoyFoster> That's a clever way of doing it.
[3:50:50] <GarbageQueenEllie> From what I gather, you don't understand her either, Than
[3:50:50] <+seaearthandsky> it sure is LUL
[3:51:02] <RedAhoge> wait a sec is this thancred
[3:51:08] <+Estuko> monkaS
[3:51:10] <RedAhoge> oh it is
[3:51:21] <$Yakobro> LUL
[3:51:22] <RedAhoge> i have 144 on
[3:51:24] <Mythundare> standing in stuff and getting hit LUL
[3:51:30] <@ThePlotHole> What a boomer
[3:51:30] <%spiritofmojave> these vuln stacks LUL
[3:51:32] <+valkuma> Its a shame you cant read the tooltip on controller
[3:51:37] <+justianxix> SourPls
[3:51:50] <+TheImmortal70> Yeah no, that sucks
[3:51:54] <+Larc9783> Thancred got so much cooler when he became squall
[3:51:54] <%Faustgesicht> @valkuma what's it say?
[3:52:07] <+TheImmortal70> Thancred seals off his aether to hide himself basically
[3:52:10] <+Estuko> and you don't gotta make a brand new character for classes?
[3:52:11] <%Yadogari> Thancred stops the flow of his eather
[3:52:11] <+TheImmortal70> He's killing himself to hide
[3:52:14] <arkv01> can't wait to do LIONHEART
[3:52:15] <Overloard> can't wait for cutsene loss after this in game win
[3:52:16] <RedAhoge> this fight is pretty long
[3:52:20] <gekizenbu> @Estuko yeah you can just class change
[3:52:23] <+Estuko> ooooo
[3:52:26] <+valkuma> @Faustgesicht the disguise trick he is doing is "Stopping the flow of life-giving aether to disguise oneself" and the big move is "Using minfilias special cartridges that she prepared with love"
[3:52:47] <arkv01> inject the love Kreygasms
[3:52:47] <Zebroneath> Just being reminded of the podcast earlier of how people who suck would yell and complain that this fight is too hard.
[3:52:49] <Jeemukun> random question since it's tangentially releated, but anybody else remember those ye olde FF11 comics fred perry made?
[3:52:50] <+valkuma> @Faustgesicht it also says something about the move being extremely physically destructive to the point where its suicide to use the move.
[3:52:53] <%Maids4lyfe> SourPls
[3:52:54] <%Deft_Thought> Minfilia packed extra gunpowder
[3:53:00] <$Kirby_Sauce> Man, imagine if instead of saying "luke, i am your father", vader went "ey, wanker! I fukked yer mum!
[3:53:00] <RedAhoge> Minfilia nectar

[3:53:43] <RedAhoge> monkaS
[3:53:43] <+Larc9783> rip thancred?
[3:53:46] <%spiritofmojave> the Joestar technique
[3:53:54] <+allanvv> it's good they make you feel the struggle through gameplay
[3:53:55] <%Maids4lyfe> LUL
[3:53:55] <GarbageQueenEllie> @CrimsonGargoyle They should give Pat ALL of the moneys
[3:53:59] <CuriousReborn> Endure monkaS
[3:53:59] <RedAhoge> You have so much HP you cant possibly lose
[3:54:15] <+valkuma> @Faustgesicht THe one hes about to use now says "SEVERS the flow of aether to the body to hide oneself completely. Results in death" its super fucking epic to read midcombat because of how the first one failed just now
[3:54:16] <mayorrev> yeah i think you're supposed to win this
[3:54:17] <+TheSaintJohn> if pat loses on stream what do we win?
[3:54:22] <mayorrev> you can do it
[3:54:22] <%Deft_Thought> You can't lose like this! You're a dad!
[3:54:24] <%spiritofmojave> the potion regens every 30s anyway
[3:54:24] <%Valdorick> Unceremonious beheading, Jesus Christ, what an attack name.
[3:54:27] <$SleepyMaribo> @RedAhoge Hes being hit with Tank busters and Invul up, its a matter of time
[3:54:31] <%Deft_Thought> An anime dad at that

[3:54:57] <$Kirby_Sauce> Man, imagine a healer villian.
[3:54:59] <Besadon> monkaS
[3:55:03] <+TheImmortal70> The cartridge she filled many times
[3:55:05] <+Williamld> Cutting yourself off from the lifestream
[3:55:07] <%QuadraticGravity> He stopped his heart
[3:55:13] <+valkuma> @AngriestPat if you read the tooltip it says how the user completely severs the flow of aether in their body and it kills the user
[3:55:17] <KatabolicRage> lets just say thancreds method of invisibility is somewhat sucicdal
[3:55:21] <%solomonpun> Thancred's straightup killing himself to win.
[3:55:25] <GarbageQueenEllie> Yeeeeah
[3:55:27] <RedAhoge> I want Thancred to bust out a Devil Bringer arm

[3:59:30] <%RedKnightVI> No one's ever REALLY gone
[3:59:43] <Maverick2736> gotta give him some CRED for THANking that for as long as he did
[3:59:43] <%Deft_Thought> So someone explain why you didn't just stick around and kill the fuck out of Ran
[3:59:48] <%Ninestempest> pat it's just for if you leave befor edoing the story
[3:59:49] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 4 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 16oz (480mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[3:59:51] <%Ninestempest> you can walk back here later
[3:59:56] <dredshift> So the game's way of showing off the new class is to essentially have you get your ass kicked by an old man?
[4:00:00] <+VashyronM> Just collect the Dragon Balls
[4:00:01] <mayorrev> no one's ever REALLY gone
[4:00:01] <GarbageQueenEllie> Thancred? More like Than down the crap shooter

[4:00:09] <+valkuma> @dredshift nah you kick his ass
[4:00:12] <%Diabetic> I swear you are about to walk up to the shores of Silent Hill lake and some Mary bitch is gonna cough all over you.
[4:00:13] <+TheImmortal70> Role quests are the game's way of playing in scenarios your character couldn't feasibly be a part of
[4:00:19] <%Kain5707> @AngriestPat i hope you have at least 1 healer for the 79 trial, tank queue is 30+
[4:00:21] <+smevvster> Last time WoL fought Ran'jit with an entire squad, you got your shit pushed in. Thancred was tryin to keep him there rather than win so you could move on with Minfilia
[4:00:28] <%Valdorick> Pray, he returned to the Waking Sands.

[4:47:37] <alrobot2014> this looks terrifying to maneuver around
[4:47:38] <CrypticMochi> Next patch, “leylines are a stand.”
[4:47:54] <+TheImmortal70> Next patch, leylines give you more defense
[4:48:03] <%spiritofmojave> mobile leylines would be the next calamity
[4:48:07] <%SlowLikeThunder> I'm pretty sure this boss is actually super easy but sometimes my brain just stops working and I get hit by three of the + beams in a row
[4:48:10] <elisascarlet> Leylines will automatically force the healer to target and heal you Jebaited
[4:48:17] <Thenuclearwalrus> This boss is great, it kills bads
[4:48:18] <+Tokanova> mobile leylines but they move at a snails crawl
[4:48:22] <%Valdorick> Next patch - Leylines are even smaller
[4:48:24] <%whiskey_wolfe_> Storge sounds like a blockage in your dick after you play with it a little too much.
[4:48:26] <+TheImmortal70> We actually need like, noncast
[4:48:31] <+TheImmortal70> nine back to back instant casts
[4:48:34] <Hidashi13> is the boss regening?
[4:48:42] <VioletHeart> I feel like giving leylines a defense nerf might actually solve the problem. Just to encourage Black Mages to move *sometimes*. Or it'll make it a million times worse. I'm not sure.
[4:48:47] <%whiskey_wolfe_> "Ah sorry kid, looks like you got a bunch of storge all in there."
[4:48:58] <%Maids4lyfe> LUL
[4:49:02] <GarbageQueenEllie> @whiskey_wolfe_ Considering that it represents familial love, that is hilarious
[4:49:02] <baronvonkame> Actually isn't storge a type of greecian love? eros, phillia and storge are just different love things
[4:49:07] <%Maids4lyfe> yes
[4:49:09] <RossMirage> It would actually be neat for Lv 82 a Shukuchi like ability for BLM. You move your Leylines to a target position then Between the Lines.

[4:56:11] <KahunaTuna> That sword looks familiar PogChamp
[4:56:12] <%abakkus> if i could have only one wish it would be ro rid the world of feet. stumps forever fuckers
[4:56:12] <zamzoph> SHOW FEET
[4:56:12] <%whiskey_wolfe_> Paige can't get satisfied unless Pat finishes into a full tray of lasagne.
[4:56:13] <EuropantLamprey> How about Paws Pat?
[4:56:16] <$RetroCop87> WRIGGLING. FAT. TOES.
[4:56:17] <ShichiNoBushi> Then why do you flaunt them in front of us every night.
[4:56:17] <mayorrev> @AngriestPat what about your feet
[4:56:18] <%MelBrooksKA> You know what else is disgusting... humanity...
[4:56:20] <%spiritofmojave> Hands tho
[4:56:21] <+RootVeggie> But what about armpits
[4:56:23] <+BubbaRands> Show feet plz
[4:56:24] <leargo> no they are feet
[4:56:25] <%solomonpun> You know what kink I'm into? Consent.
[4:56:27] <Jeemukun> they are pat, they used to be hands once upon a time
[4:56:29] <FalseEyeD> Now on to the important subject. Armpits.
[4:56:32] <thegreenbenis> SHOW FEET
[4:56:33] <%Faustgesicht> cuz they are,
[4:56:33] <RupanSen> I'm not super into feet but I can find them sexy
[4:56:34] <%terminallyCapriciousz> Lasagna isn't cheap, i guess that's why they don't do it often
[4:56:36] <+StrawberryPantsu> Nice feet are nice
[4:56:38] <%MelBrooksKA> Hands are deformed feet @AngriestPat
[4:56:39] <Smart_ZaK1> Handholding is my crazy fetish
[4:56:40] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Not everybody's, there are gross ones though. Like Jennifer Aniston'S
[4:56:42] <%ProtagonistJake> the problem with feet isnt even the fetish, but the fact people who love it dont shut the fuck up and are the worst
[4:56:43] <%Valdorick> Live on Stream - Pat kinkshames internet Ratman, Clemps.
[4:56:45] <+Estuko> what about sweaty abs on 7ft tall amazon women
[4:56:46] <%bevyrage> @solomonpun i see you're a person of culture
[4:56:47] <%dylin456> what about a good flogging
[4:56:48] <%Bigdrifter210> ASS OR TITS PAT
[4:56:48] <KahunaTuna> what about personality jermaPluto
[4:56:48] <corepercentlives> unshaved armpits
[4:56:48] <mayorrev> Kinkshaming is my kink
[4:56:50] <Ozmodyas> But Pat, how else would a girl step on you
[4:56:50] <%meltdown547> To be fair, hands are more the deformed feet, rather than the other way around.
[4:56:51] <+Tokanova> i'm into consenting missionairy sex between married couples for the express purpose of procreation :)
[4:57:06] <Jeemukun> I heard the bit in your brain that controls feet is right next to the bit in your brain that's all about the sex
[4:57:06] <EuropantLamprey> You could complete your transformation into Yoshikage Kira and pick up a hand fetish
[4:57:07] <ShichiNoBushi> What if I put a tiny pat on a girl's foot?
[4:57:08] <Huntercd> I mean if Hillary Clinton asked me I would
[4:57:10] <$RetroCop87> I'm a fan of the back of girl's necks, but honestly it comes off as kinda stalkerish
[4:57:11] <itzzapizza> BEGONE FEET
[4:57:13] <ShichiNoBushi> *tiny hat
[4:57:15] <snowmanse> You also said "little". Are your feet smaller than your hands? Because that isn't normal.
[4:57:17] <grayjammer> Would you rather people have no feet? Because, y’know, Amputation’s also a fetish...
[4:57:22] <%whiskey_wolfe_> I don't get oft unless I shame someone else's fetish.
[4:57:23] <%Faustgesicht> deformed into usefulness
[4:57:27] <%IncredibleMeh> Hand are obviously better waifu material than feet
[4:57:29] <Maverick2736> well, I mean... if people eat ass, feet and armpits aren't that far off if you think about it
[4:57:31] <corepercentlives> unshaved feet and unshaved armpits but shaved butthole PeoplesChamp
[4:57:32] <%Valdorick> Wait yeah, is "Girl on top" Pat's Yoshikage Kria kink?
[4:57:33] <+TheImmortal70> @angriestpat The cutscene where everyone looks at the sky was BROAD daylight for me
[4:57:34] <leargo> have you seen paws
[4:57:35] <Overloard> lookit that cactuar
[4:57:37] <thegreenbenis> TOMBOY BEST KINK
[4:57:39] <alrobot2014> ^
[4:57:40] <+VariantX7> pat's into Fire emblem DS characters
[4:57:42] <%solomonpun> @bevyrage thank you, fellow scholar of the sexual arts
[4:57:43] <%spiritofmojave> hoo boy
[4:57:45] <+VariantX7> 3ds*
[4:57:48] <%demegodz> @AngriestPat the reason people are into feet, so study says, was the sexually desirable zones were switched up in the brain. So it's like people getting hot and bothered when they see a genital.
[4:57:50] <%ProtagonistJake> Dont look down on us
[4:57:50] <%spiritofmojave> it's getting messy
[4:57:50] <RupanSen> @RetroCop87 I like girl's backs
[4:57:53] <%vectorless_peon> Tomboy indeed best kink\
[4:58:02] <GarbageQueenEllie> We didn't start the foot fire, it was always burning since the worlds been turning
[4:58:04] <+Estuko> @grayjammer met a guy at my campus with that, never have I turned down a confession so hard.
[4:58:06] <EuropantLamprey> I knew a guy with a calculator fetish once
[4:58:07] <majindusto> Mutant Freakshow Cactuars
[4:58:08] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat Hey pat do you know how long this worlds been fucked like this? Do these people know what night looks like before this?
[4:58:09] <$RetroCop87> only if the girl is muscular
[4:58:09] <%mistersups> gun to your head @AngriestPat. WHAT ARE YOUR TAGS!
[4:58:09] <%SlowLikeThunder> in the course of human history, the ability to walk upright has been the most extreme development. Thus, it is nothing but simple evolutionary continuation to want to *fuck* the feet.
[4:58:10] <+Edrem> Round frame glasses are the best
[4:58:12] <%MelBrooksKA> Tomboy isn't a kink you fucking normies
[4:58:13] <%whiskey_wolfe_> Is this the real music....?
[4:58:15] <Overloard> this battle music is JAMMIN
[4:58:19] <%ProtagonistJake> What about tiny glasses
[4:58:20] <%Valdorick> Tags - Tomboy, tanlines
[4:58:20] <itzzapizza> help get me outta this chat
[4:58:20] <%PinkSuprende> 100 years gogo
[4:58:21] <ShichiNoBushi> That's just filming day for night.
[4:58:24] <zamzoph> @AngriestPat Play Touhou
[4:58:26] <grayjammer> @estuko holy shit
[4:58:26] <+Estuko> @whiskey_wolfe_ yuh
[4:58:27] <+MagickBurritoh> tiny hats are disgusting
[4:58:27] <+TheImmortal70> Flesh hats are Pat's kink
[4:58:28] <%bevyrage> the penis has a tiny hat on it
[4:58:32] <%bevyrage> when you think about it
[4:58:32] <%AnIcedCoffee> ah yes the feet hats
[4:58:33] <thegreenbenis> UNTAGGED UGLY OLD MAN
[4:58:36] <$RetroCop87> this battle music sounds like it was performed by Crush 40
[4:58:36] <+MagickBurritoh> big floppy hats are superior
[4:58:36] <worldbrand> like wisp, the warframe?
[4:58:38] <+lethallunacyx> The head of a penis is like a tiny hat.
[4:58:40] <%abakkus> shoes are chaotic good because they hide feet, the worst body part
[4:58:40] <%whiskey_wolfe_> It's pretty bangin'
[4:58:40] <%VanaSkiller> LUL
[4:58:42] <burgerdicks> Is hannibal burress in the game?
[4:58:42] <GarbageQueenEllie> I don't like how you have to have a headband attached to wear really tiny hats
[4:58:48] <triklstyx> @angriestpat If someone has a big head every hat is tiny
[4:58:50] <+MisterCrimson> OK but how do any of these people know what night looks like? If the flood happened 100 years ago, noone alive in Norvrandt would have seen the night sky
[4:58:54] <%spiritofmojave> Awakening stubs are a feature
[4:58:57] <alrobot2014> wait does the camera never pan to their feet
[4:58:59] <+TheImmortal70> What if you took of the shoe and there was just a nub, would you want to put that in your mouth?
[4:59:00] <itzzapizza> PAIGE!! this is your fault
[4:59:00] <+Sp3ctre48> Fire Emblem Fates had lots of exposed feet though 🤔
[4:59:03] <RupanSen> So Orbital Frames > Gundams?
[4:59:03] <ExpressNode> I think that's only Awakening
[4:59:06] <%Faustgesicht> amputees need love too
[4:59:09] <%ProtagonistJake> One day we'll evolve to Pat's ideal human. No pissing, liquids, ro feet
[4:59:10] <thegreenbenis> Ntr is the thinking mans fetish
[4:59:13] <%vectorless_peon> pat's on my level with this anti foot kink
[4:59:15] <%Valdorick> Orbital Frames >>>>>>> Gundams
[4:59:17] <Hidashi13> this music
[4:59:19] <+Estuko> @grayjammer yeah, he went off with like "I'm kinda into some weird kinks." I go "That's fine, same." and he lists amputation as the First thing. ffs
[4:59:26] <+MisterCrimson> Julians are better than Gunmans
[4:59:27] <Overloard> cumdums LUL
[4:59:29] <zamzoph> I'm offended by this
[4:59:31] <%Valdorick> But Gunboys > Gundums Kappa
[4:59:31] <$RetroCop87> knightmare frames > orbital frames
[4:59:35] <+lethallunacyx> I have a tiny hat it looks like a mushroom!
[4:59:40] <Shwepie> @AngriestPat Everything > Gunmans
[4:59:46] <majindusto> Corin's whole thing is having exposed feet
[4:59:47] <coreyferrell> Getting into combat music is super annoying
[4:59:51] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 5 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 20oz (600mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[4:59:51] <%whiskey_wolfe_> I mean it's not like people need nighttime, and plants certainly dont.
[4:59:54] <RupanSen> But Gundam legs are the part I like the most
[4:59:55] <ExpressNode> Think Nintendo should make a Fire Emblem MMO?
[5:00:01] <+zetaplus> eh gundams > obrital frames
[5:00:07] <+Estuko> @RupanSen legs that come with heels.
[5:00:07] <WorldFapRevealed> is this the game music?
[5:00:12] <+Edrem> yes
[5:00:17] <KUYAmoPESh> Dungams?
[5:00:18] <EuropantLamprey> Megas XLR > ALl
[5:00:23] <%SlowLikeThunder> wait the entry to the expansion, the cliff place, what was the third one?
[5:00:23] <%RittiFruity> but the Loch got good soundtrack
[5:00:26] <helpmeimafruit> ala mhigo can rot in the salt mines until the end of time
[5:00:26] <%dylin456> yeah megas
[5:00:28] <thegreenbenis> Make a bun bun
[5:00:30] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Zakus are thematically better than Gundams. They actually look like military hardware, whereas Gundams look like an art project
[5:00:30] <itzzapizza> @Stay_Hydrated_Bot God has spoken.
[5:00:30] <%SlowLikeThunder> ohhhh the Lochs
[5:00:32] <%whiskey_wolfe_> I'll be honest this zone looks like a bunch of Oblivion assets slapped together.
[5:00:33] <ShichiNoBushi> What if Paige suddenly got some degenerative disease that she had to have all her limb cut off at the shoulder and hip? She'd have no feet, though.
[5:00:34] <+MisterCrimson> this is what happens when you tell Soken to just make music
[5:00:37] <%SlowLikeThunder> I never thought of Lochs as a desert
[5:00:39] <Arkrados> @Estuko I'm a furry and i'm not that kinky, goddamn
[5:00:42] <%SlowLikeThunder> I only thought of them as garbage
[5:00:42] <%Valdorick> FUCK YOU! Reminding me of Megas XLR NotLikeThis BibleThump NotLikeThis BibleThump
[5:00:43] <+Estuko> @PlainSimpleTailor stop telling me the truth.
[5:00:47] <%MattDemers> MattDemers subscribed at Tier 2. They've subscribed for 6 months, currently on a 6 month streak! Hope you're enjoying SB patrice. Thanks for all the good streams.
[5:00:51] <Overloard> to be fair megas xlr cheats by making it a car piloted mech
[5:00:52] <helpmeimafruit> imagine if you fell off
[5:00:57] <Maverick2736> Gato from Chrono Trigger > Megas XLR > orbital frames > gumdums
[5:00:58] <+Estuko> @Arkrados lol
[5:00:58] <$RetroCop87> man, anyone remember Star Driver? those mecha had heels for days
[5:01:02] <GarbageQueenEllie> doggie can fly
[5:01:12] <snowmanse> Pay the extra $600 to be knocked out completely.
[5:01:18] <snowmanse> instead of local anesthesia
[5:01:22] <Huntercd> Dog butthole
[5:01:23] <%Maids4lyfe> ^
[5:01:28] <%whiskey_wolfe_> @Valdorick hey that show got a pretty solid ending.
[5:01:28] <+Estuko> @Maids4lyfe lol
[5:01:29] <worldbrand> Don't hang around people who make you laugh
[5:01:30] <%Maids4lyfe> LUL
[5:01:31] <+VashyronM> Don't expect to eat solid food for a few days
[5:01:38] <+Ell1ot> don't forget to flush out your gums after you eat
[5:01:39] <42nfl19> DONT TAKE the pain meds when it hurts, take it proactively SO YOU NEVER HURT- guy who got ALL 4 moalrs removed at once
[5:01:44] <ExpressNode> I hope you like sucking on your gauze inside your mouth
[5:01:45] <%Maids4lyfe> @Estuko my timing is shit Kappa
[5:01:50] <Mythundare> It was a mistake naming back-to-back expansions SB
[5:01:52] <%mistersups> You will wake up with gauze in your mouth after wisdom teeth surgery. You're not choking it's okay.
[5:01:55] <burgerdicks> Are flying mounts new to the expansion? Or is this just finally unlocked for his mount?
[5:01:57] <+VariantX7> @snowmanse listen to this man you do not want to be awake for that shit
[5:02:08] <Ozmodyas> Had a badly decayed wisdom tooth out a few days ago, doesn’t hurt at all compared to having it still in
[5:02:11] <itzzapizza> hot towels on your jawline did me wonders when i got mine pulled
[5:02:16] <%Maids4lyfe> @burgerdicks flying mounts have always been a thing
[5:02:18] <GarbageQueenEllie> And get ready to feel suuuuper high after the procedure. You gonna be out for days
[5:02:19] <worldbrand> they're both pretty good names though
[5:02:19] <helpmeimafruit> shtormblood
[5:02:21] <%Valdorick> Just call 'em StB and ShB
[5:02:21] <alrobot2014> but Shadowbringer though
[5:02:23] <majindusto> STRONG BAD?
[5:02:25] <%Gogogolem> They have to commit to it now.
[5:02:25] <Overloard> StBl and ShBr
[5:02:28] <%whiskey_wolfe_> They should've called this expansion ManFightz.
[5:02:32] <%Fatmanjoggin> Watch the next one be siegebreaker or some shit
[5:02:37] <thegreenbenis> THIGHS
[5:02:39] <KUYAmoPESh> Can you make regular gear to transmog?
[5:02:42] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Do sub messages have a time limit or something? not seeing the option
[5:02:42] <ShichiNoBushi> Could have done something like the AC, BC, CC trend of FF7 spinoff games.
[5:02:43] <KageAruki> I had 2 wisdom teeth removed at once with local anesthesia and took like 1 painkiller afterwards and had no issues. I've heard of it going horribly wrong too. Just hope you have a good oral surgeon
[5:02:44] <thegreenbenis> Jesus thighs
[5:02:45] <GarbageQueenEllie> And they'll have to wire your mouth shut for a bit- you can only have liquids
[5:02:45] <%SlowLikeThunder> no you don't get it it's suhbuh and shubu
[5:02:47] <42nfl19> Light monster? just inject some DARKNESS into you!
[5:02:47] <%SlowLikeThunder> very different
[5:02:50] <itzzapizza> yeah pats a hoe
[5:02:57] <KageAruki> but it's not guaranteed misery
[5:02:57] <%sshen> Think it shoulda been called nightbringers
[5:03:00] <EuropantLamprey> He looks like a Bara Golfer
[5:03:00] <Zebroneath> oops

[5:03:37] <bestwaifuritsu> Boneitis

[5:03:42] <Huntercd> Y'shtola got a neck tattoo?
[5:03:43] <GarbageQueenEllie> Purge the Light from inside you by going Goth
[5:03:43] <+VariantX7> sound of all his bones shattering at once

[5:04:11] <thegreenbenis> No mommy gf
[5:04:13] <helpmeimafruit> yshtola just threatened to spank your 600 pound roe ass, how does that make you feel?
[5:04:17] <%Valdorick> Yshtola can take me across her knee anytime
[5:04:19] <mayorrev> Did you literally get your dark soul filled with light?
[5:04:21] <%whiskey_wolfe_> Lulu Catgirl can geddit
[5:04:23] <%demegodz> Spanking is the fetish now
[5:04:28] <majindusto> CAT MOTHER

[5:04:33] <%spiritofmojave> Kreygasm
[5:04:33] <thegreenbenis> Tfw no cat mommy gf
[5:04:34] <Hidashi13> got hit in the face by a 90 mph foul ball
[5:04:36] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat if she's blind why does she have no problem getting around?
[5:04:43] <alrobot2014> cat mommy fetish AND spanking, they totally knew
[5:04:44] <KUYAmoPESh> more tiddies lulu
[5:04:51] <+Tokanova> i wish y'shtola was my mom, things would be different around here :(
[5:04:51] <+StrawberryPantsu> yishtola is like 23
[5:04:52] <Huntercd> Y'shtola as a mommy domme is great
[5:04:53] <GarbageQueenEllie> Why is 99% of your friends in this game super fuckable? It's not fair!
[5:04:58] <%Ranryu692> she's Daredevil?
[5:04:59] <Koosahmii> Runar would Ike to be put across her knee
[5:05:00] <%solomonpun> @king_wragles she has magic daredevil eyes
[5:05:00] <%Gogogolem> Should have called this expansion Shine Blockers.
[5:05:00] <%king_wragles> ah, duh. Thanks

[5:05:05] <KatabolicRage> visas marr vision basically
[5:05:06] <$philoboy123> So she's not blind
[5:05:06] <majindusto> Why is Y'shtola "Lulu" now?
[5:05:08] <+TheImmortal70> She uses magic to see and it's killing her just like how Thancred keeps trying to kill himself
[5:05:16] <%SlowLikeThunder> there's also a plot point about how it slowly kills her but that hasn't been brought up in like 2 years?
[5:05:18] <zamzoph> Cheats like Geordi
[5:05:18] <%spiritofmojave> Y'shtola has always been dom mom
[5:05:20] <%whiskey_wolfe_> @StrawberryPantsu 23 is like 65 in the Final Fantasy universe
[5:05:21] <%demegodz> :O
[5:05:24] <alrobot2014> hey ghost bitch
[5:05:34] <EuropantLamprey> Can we have a blind character who is actually blind for once?
[5:05:35] <bestwaifuritsu> Really goes to show how much of a failure Thancred is if he cant even manage to kill himself
[5:05:36] <+VariantX7> Ghost in the house, guess i'm not sleeping ever again
[5:05:40] <helpmeimafruit> hasn't yshtola been dying since ARR but she's been in the first for like 4 years
[5:05:45] <%Gogogolem> @EuropantLamprey Go watch avatar
[5:05:48] <itzzapizza> oh okay then ill leave
[5:05:50] <+TheImmortal70> I mean we're all dying
[5:05:51] <%MelBrooksKA> Can Y'shtola see why kids love the cinnamon-y taste of cinnamon toast crunch @AngriestPat ?
[5:05:51] <majindusto> GHOST PRICK
