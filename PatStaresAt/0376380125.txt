[0:15:00] <%QueequegTheater> Woolie is my favorite fighting game
[0:15:01] <exalt4747> I can see the appeal of the latter for sure.
[0:15:06] <+bthevboi> DMC5 demo is obtained by making New Zealand psn account for new joiners
[0:15:07] <%fermentthegarbage> I hate technical fighting games like it’s a video game not damn statistics homework

[0:16:17] <+timblenaut> bloodborne came close
[0:16:18] <JamvaanPS4> It was rough, those load screens were the most brutal until I played Final Fantasy XII
[0:16:20] <alwayspronking> MHW on PS4?

[0:16:26] <%Raxus_Secundus> Worse than day 1 bloodborne???
[0:16:27] <bearodactyl_raptor1> Load times were horrendous
[0:16:27] <+Cityscape17> ok, the load times were pretty bad for the time
[0:16:27] <ShichiNoBushi> Also apparently a troll player can rush towards a critical item and never give it up.
[0:16:28] <Vashido22> It was worse than Bloodborne
[0:16:28] <djbrooks603> Oh god the WAITING
[0:16:28] <%mercado94> TIME STILL PASSED?!??!
[0:16:29] <+chronopaladin> watch that infection rate go up
[0:16:29] <%RaikenTB> Load times are the truest horror.

[0:16:47] <rad_dude123465> Not even pre patch bloodborne?
[0:16:48] <%Cooltastik> needs solo mode
[0:16:49] <PessimisticOptimism> It’s a stupid BR
[0:16:49] <iamtheTwitchghost> Outbreak file 3 when
[0:16:51] <%GarbageNirvana> So if you wanna play with me
[0:16:54] <$Kefbar> totaly understand that
[0:16:54] <captainshtbox> its baddo
[0:16:58] <ScreamingMeat> Titanfall?
[0:16:58] <$Order_of_Mystery> wait, Apex is ONLY teams?
[0:16:58] <%Fadedblank247> for me i don't like the forcing me into teams and no solo play
[0:16:59] <Naho_Saenoki> @bleugh It had both tank controls and the option to not have tank controls. You can also aim and move at the smae time in File 2.
[0:16:59] <%fermentthegarbage> Verticality?
[0:17:01] <Thepenguinking1> any games you're looking forward to this year besides dmcV?
[0:17:02] <%lewdskeletor13> I thought it was good
[0:17:05] <%zerocruz> Played one and didn't liked it
[0:17:06] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@rad_dude123465) (warning)
[0:17:06] <%FrostMass22> Apex was my first BR and I can't tell if I hate Apex or BR in general
[0:17:06] <+Cityscape17> you know what was fun? ratchet and clank online with the ps2 using the network adaptor
[0:17:06] <+Ez3z> I thought you liked quake tho
[0:17:07] <CalderGaming> apex is only 3-player squads
[0:17:07] <$SGrim> @Order_of_Mystery yes
[0:17:10] <+Cityscape17> that was fun
[0:17:10] <+eldritchhorrortwitchchat> Yep apex is a team game
[0:17:10] <captainshtbox> member titan fall 2 that was a good game
[0:17:11] <SkyPirateArcane> Play smarter, not harder
[0:17:12] <SchlongKongEduardo> its alright
[0:17:12] <BalloniWright> can't wait for "DMC2 download complete" Kappa
[0:17:15] <$Order_of_Mystery> @SGrim what the fuck
[0:17:18] <%nmaten> just play hide and seek then
[0:17:18] <$Kefbar> i won like 8 matches today because i survieved everything
[0:17:19] <FatherGreyBeard> Outbreak was kinda online, so while loading was happening the game was loading other creatures/monsters/players could do things
[0:17:21] <+eldritchhorrortwitchchat> No single at all
[0:17:21] <DraxTD> and then somone Snipes @AngriestPat
[0:17:22] <%HentaiSenpai9K> GIT GUD PAt
[0:17:23] <%fermentthegarbage> This just in, Pat hates people
[0:17:24] <$SGrim> @Order_of_Mystery the game's flawed
[0:17:24] <DirtyPopcornJ> eventually
[0:17:25] <nina9669> u need the big run aways
[0:17:25] <%Dr_DangerPhD> @Order_of_Mystery yeah, 3 person squad with hero based characters, team synergy is a big deal
[0:17:25] <%dimeybot> You need HEAVY SUSTAINED COUNTERFIRE
[0:17:27] <%GohanEgret> going so lo lo lo lo lo looo
[0:17:29] <InsomniacPersona> I feel like they will add a solo mode eventually
[0:17:32] <CalderGaming> apex matches are nice and quick, though
[0:17:35] <darksoul274> @AngriestPat since Lady & Trish have alternate costumes, does that mean they are playable?
[0:17:37] <captainshtbox> member titanfall 2 camp? AwA that was real good
[0:17:38] <InugamiTheHound> resident evil outbreak file 2 was the first RE game you can shoot and walk at the same time
[0:17:39] <rad_dude123465> @angriestpat SQUADS FUCKING SUCK
[0:17:39] <%dimeybot> Solo/Duos are coming my dude.
[0:17:43] <+paladinstarbuster> Woolie apparently thinks its good
[0:17:45] <%FrostMass22> But Apex has a squad system since they have classes, for some reason
[0:17:48] <Cobaltor_252> at least the ping system makes it easier for everyone to communicate
[0:17:49] <%GohanEgret> ! stroke !

[0:22:09] <%AdmiralButtloaf> "The inventor if roads or some shit" what a legacy
[0:22:09] <+thatfatguy98> The Canadian leader should be a sentient maple leaf

[0:33:02] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @PaleBloodInk seriously, Capcom put serious money into the RE engine
[0:33:02] <%MightyMaxT> I was a bit worried that this would behave super muted colors but it looks fine

[0:59:29] <devanmuse> @ebola_beetle after he streams all of umineko
[0:59:32] <Xirn> more like a buster interrupt isn't it?
[0:59:32] <ModeratelyHardcore> This hand of mine is Burning red

[0:59:52] <+Th3SmartAlec> BIG bomb
[0:59:54] <Yaya_> everything is royal guard if you believe hard enough

[0:59:57] <%Prism_Wing> Is this Anor Guardo? Kappa
[0:59:57] <SailingSaturn> @MadCrainProductions unfortunately not, probably to prevent data mining
[0:59:58] <$psydaku> how do I get the demo on ps4

[1:17:42] <burkey0307> full LP with woolie when?
[1:17:42] <+Exyoh> The back-blast while you're still killing the front bugs to start the next batch is too hype. Too hype
[1:17:42] <%grimpo96> How satisfying is it knowing that the better the music, the better your combo?
[1:17:43] <+Th3SmartAlec> This demo is GOTY, sorry RE2
[1:17:43] <%ThePuddingDead> YO*
[1:17:44] <caol2017> Is it exceeding all expectations though
[1:17:45] <tank7013> @TheFilth It was speculated for a while but Itsuno just recently confirmed it. Agnus had sex. With a person. Somehow
[1:17:45] <%FrustratedAF> chat, does the taunt bonus stay the same regardless of when you interrupt ir?
[1:17:48] <ivansonic08> @AngriestPat Have you expectations been SHATTERED yet?
[1:17:49] <haisho> and this is just with playable Nero in the demo. What about Dante and V?
[1:17:50] <+aishman> So it doesn't look to be an actual new-oh wait you get a new devil arm this time
[1:17:52] <Hyphixsys> man, I want Dragon's Dogma 2, now Capcom !!!
[1:17:53] <%KaironFortressKnight> are your expectations exceeded yet??
[1:17:53] <+Maids4lyfe> I missed it, who dabbed?
[1:17:54] <rosemon5001> oof missing a small nook
[1:17:58] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I clapped when they said they clapped
[1:17:58] <%zerocruz> NUT
[1:18:03] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Would this be a good time to get into DMC as a beginner?
[1:18:03] <%joylent_blue> haisho Dante and V only in the full game
[1:18:04] <deviljhojho94> my fucking dick
[1:18:10] <Idon__> rocketo paaaawnchu
[1:18:11] <%joylent_blue> PlainSimpleTailor the best time
[1:18:15] <b_ikki> @AngriestPat you can call it back by pressing again when it's out
[1:18:16] <SailingSaturn> @FrustratedAF if its like the previous, it has to go all the way
[1:18:17] <+天使42199> @PlainSimpleTailor dont ask just play
[1:18:21] <%Trinity5> god ex calibur is so fucking cool
[1:18:22] <Justinbattleborn> Thanks Pat for helping me get through my homework
[1:18:22] <%aishman> Man I really hope I didn't just lose my sub chain
[1:18:22] <haisho> I mean Pat's already THIS happy with just Nero in the game.
[1:18:28] <coke_monster> Im already a demon...
[1:18:30] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Oh god, are they gonna pull a Bleach and make this Karakura town important?
[1:18:30] <%ThePuddingDead> i hope steam gets a demo
[1:18:33] <+Exyoh> Oh, is that a room off to the right?
[1:18:34] <goinhart> @PlainSimpleTailor sure, i've heard the eased up some of the execution in DMC5. Plus the other games are fairly cheap on steam
[1:18:38] <%Trinity5> @aishman 6 months big dog
[1:18:41] <Monkeyking966> @plainsimpletailor it's a good time
[1:18:41] <deviljhojho94> if this game does not shit the bed, it might just become the best DMC ever
[1:18:43] <Idon__> Just do it for ALL of them 4Head
[1:18:44] <%Trinity5> @aishman you're good
[1:18:46] <BlacSoul> Stories don’t really tie up together too much
[1:18:47] <+namillus> I love how Redgrave City is London'y

[1:18:49] <+Th3SmartAlec> Doh
[1:18:51] <%aishman> Oh good, it wasn't showing up on my end and I freaked out for a moment
[1:18:51] <Hyphixsys> @ThePuddingDead they'll add it, like how they did with Resident Evil 2
[1:18:52] <DirtyPopcornJ> Capcom has now mastered the art of "Don't betray your fanbase"
[1:19:00] <+Th3SmartAlec> YEYE
[1:19:01] <%ThePuddingDead> god i hope so
[1:19:02] <%dking0000> Do we have any idea how long this game is gonna be compared to 4 or 3?
[1:19:02] <%joylent_blue> VoHiYo
[1:19:06] <jrnmo> god damn i want to play this game
[1:19:08] <deviljhojho94> Dont trust them so quickly brother. But i sure hope so
[1:19:10] <+Cook_4_Souls> They got the old DMC3 enemies back
[1:19:10] <+Maids4lyfe> until Capcom betrays their fanbase again
[1:19:11] <+Exyoh> I can't believe the way the punch arm is functionally a summoned sword
[1:19:12] <%Niney_Who> apatBig Boner

[1:19:17] <%joylent_blue> dking0000 3 and 4*
[1:19:18] <ModeratelyHardcore> The fact you have universal snatch on top of the arm power was the smartest decision
[1:19:18] <DirtyPopcornJ> true
[1:19:18] <%Trinity5> @dking0000 there's an estimated time limit out there, think it's 15 hours
[1:19:20] <Idon__> backlfip into sword combo Kreygasm

[1:19:44] <+xx123manxx> well the deal with an RE2 demo is there is not much to spoil in a 20 year old game, but for a new thing I doubt they will have a pc demo @Hyphixsys
[1:19:44] <%ThePuddingDead> @PlainSimpleTailor oh absolutely!
[1:19:45] <%FrustratedAF> take note: missing the enemy doesn't help your combos Jebaited
[1:19:45] <%kamen_advent> Pat did you get the deluxe edition so you get the Mega Buster?
[1:19:46] <%CerberusDriver> DmC said taunts were dumb and took away from the story ;_;
[1:19:47] <+namillus> @PlainSimpleTailor This is Devil May Cry! Of course there are taunts!

[1:26:21] <+天使42199> kamiys twitter is Gaijin Guard
[1:26:26] <+namillus> @silvcrest They foreshadowed it with Monster Hunter World.

[1:26:48] <%tiishi> what is that subtitle font lmao
[1:26:49] <tank7013> @zecht89 That's just a ridiculous way to think. Besides I'm not saying XV is a masterpiece here, just that it's a pretty good game on it's own merits. As an FF though I agree it doesn't fit in to the series
[1:26:49] <+imporia_> gerbera him !
[1:26:53] <frozenottsel> Is this a dark souls boss room?
[1:26:55] <%TheFilth> @Personified134 upgrades and the rocket arm

[1:27:02] <%Keeble24> "Jack it up all you want" he says
[1:27:03] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Am I the only one who wants bosses who realistically become injured/tired as a fight progresses? No, not Monster Hunter...
[1:27:03] <%terminallyCapriciousz> I think this is the same demo as last time but for the console that didn't get it
[1:27:09] <+天使42199> re7 was a good game but not a good resident evil game for me. im much more happy with re 2 remake
[1:27:11] <$thebonebard> SCU- uh oh

[1:27:17] <+timblenaut> cut fluffy tail!
[1:27:20] <GameXful2> RE7 was the beggining of the redemption arc, not MONHUN
[1:27:20] <%zerocruz> Ethan was cool tho
[1:27:22] <Cobaltor_252> quick, cut his tail off for a cool sword!
[1:27:23] <+ChestMimik> I think you missed
[1:27:24] <%TheFilth> short range on the laser
[1:27:24] <SnaKemuho> @namillus I mean when you get hit during the attack and lose it
[1:27:24] <%reddpop_> THE GOOD SHIT I love that line
[1:27:24] <Archmortal> you were too far away
[1:27:26] <sunny_side_up> big miss
[1:27:27] <+Th3SmartAlec> Get fucked
[1:27:27] <DrunkenEdubs> Samus final smash
[1:27:28] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Try aiming
[1:27:30] <+Grayhammatter> you missed
[1:27:31] <$thebonebard> 1
[1:27:32] <+in_spaaace> Out of range
[1:27:32] <%reddpop_> hopefully it doesnt get old
[1:27:32] <%Plague_Nurse> You have tp get close to him
[1:27:32] <%Nobrev> too far i think
[1:27:32] <+imporia_> S U C C

[1:27:38] <%aishman> You were too far away
[1:27:38] <ScreamingMeat> To far away
[1:27:38] <+namillus> Yeah, that's both those mechanics.
[1:27:39] <Fujiwara_92> YOU MISSED
[1:27:39] <%dking0000> Holy shit I just realized the potential of other boss stage transitions
[1:27:40] <majindusto> SEE YA
[1:27:42] <SpiritsRiseR2> when inside a building, the air version of the beam is better
[1:27:45] <krymzen5> love the physics
[1:27:46] <%ElenaManetta> I was gonna type something and I almost called Nero "Leon"
[1:27:48] <tungstenviper> @AngriestPat use Calibur to get closer and dodge without interrupting combos
[1:27:53] <%Rngiddion> do the punchline break on him
[1:27:53] <Guardiansaiyan> KAIJU
[1:27:54] <%ThePuddingDead> he just smacked him with a car
[1:27:59] <%TheFilth> Money attack!
[1:27:59] <majindusto> SCUM
[1:28:00] <%lewdskeletor13> I thought Nero was Leon?
[1:28:00] <HorribleHog> AWW it only happens once
[1:28:01] <tank7013> That's dope
[1:28:01] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> SourPls
[1:28:03] <xeros720> you should see if you can throw the car at him
[1:28:04] <%HentaiSenpai9K> The damage physics tho
[1:28:05] <Idon__> Grand Theft Comboes
[1:28:08] <%joylent_blue> @AngriestPat try Gerbera's hold circle move while in the air
[1:28:08] <ChineseNininga> Wait CAN YOU PARRY THE CAR?
[1:28:10] <DaHaLoJeDi> this hitbox is magic
[1:28:10] <+namillus> Risk/Reward because using them has a little bit of wind-up, resource management because you have very limited supply of them.
[1:28:10] <HorribleHog> I wanted to see that rubble effect every time he groundslams
[1:28:11] <+天使42199> @PsychoFlash1 if your looking at flash games, theres much better stuff then meet n fuck lol. meet n fuck is just for memes
[1:28:12] <%Prism_Wing> Just like in real life Kappa
[1:28:15] <Worldbrand> the little effect behind the style meter matches the bgm
[1:28:16] <+bear_breaker20> Car IS a hitbox
[1:28:16] <DaHaLoJeDi> this ENGINE is magic
[1:28:16] <%aishman> Yeah right now Pat can't see us guys. Too focus on being a big boy
[1:28:19] <%cvp5127> can you reflect his projectiles?
[1:28:20] <%Nikopol1717> Gore Magala horns
[1:28:21] <%Kravedarknesss> @lewdskeletor13 nah Dante is leon
[1:28:24] <Idon__> Truck-kun is the master of the car hitbox
[1:28:25] <%aishman> You can @cvp5127 !
[1:28:28] <Guardiansaiyan> @Prism_Wing where is my sword if this is real life?!
[1:28:33] <%cvp5127> PogChamp
[1:28:34] <+Exyoh> This music really toes a line with tone for the whole franchise, it's great
[1:28:34] <+namillus> So 1) you don't want to get hit when you use them otherwise they're wasted, but 2) if you get them off they're HUGE.
[1:28:34] <%aishman> You can also CATCH the cars
[1:28:38] <%aishman> With the lighting arm
[1:28:41] <Reanimator83> Car is the final boss confirmed

[1:28:52] <zecht89> @tank7013 of course not, you just can't distinguish why something is bad beyond subjective matters and no ffxv does nothing well, other than graphics
[1:28:52] <%Keeble24> these are Leon levels of insults
[1:28:53] <buffmurffy> parry the ball pat

[1:28:58] <coreybom> Completely honestly, should I play DmC? I've been playing the others, and from looking at DmC, it seems like this game takes a lot from it.

[1:29:11] <majindusto> Don't you mean Dante is Leon?
[1:29:12] <waifoong98> No Dante Demo?
[1:29:12] <jobbedbone> is there no music because pat sucks?
[1:29:14] <+PANDAisonfire94> CUT THE TAIL
[1:29:16] <ivansonic08> @TheFilth It is but there aren't lyrics
[1:29:20] <%aishman> @coreybom Not...really? This game takes a bit of DmC but also from Bayo 2
[1:29:21] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @coreybom You got a month still. Sure, why not
[1:29:21] <+gael_jebidibah> With the scale of this boss fight being super massive, I wonder how many will be in the game

[1:32:03] <%HyperCharge_Sam> Pat cheated to get the demo early
[1:32:06] <%KaironFortressKnight> you can just attack it too
[1:32:06] <TheHairiestHare> How do I demo?
[1:32:06] <crimsonsaens> You need to buy breakers

[1:32:13] <%joylent_blue> they were grayed out
[1:32:17] <crimsonsaens> Breakers appear grayed out if you don't have them
[1:32:19] <Fujiwara_92> YOU NEED TO BUY THEM l
[1:32:20] <+mechslayer71> Grayed out
[1:32:20] <%Divryne> @AngriestPat Jump cancelling is super easy now.
[1:32:21] <+天使42199> whose dick did pat suck to get the demo early
[1:32:24] <thecrispyones> one arm run CrreamAwk
[1:32:24] <majindusto> Except it isnt a successor to DmC and it is a joke to even entertain that idea
[1:32:33] <%joylent_blue> you need to either buy them or find them
[1:32:33] <+mechslayer71> @angel42199 New zealand’s
[1:32:33] <tmix1600> B1gboss it takes why more than that dude
[1:32:36] <+atlasbot1> you can use a New zealand account to get it early
[1:32:37] <Inebriateddonut> @天使42199 new zealand's I guess?
[1:32:38] <love_plays> i heard pat can suck his own dick
[1:32:40] <+天使42199> LUL
[1:32:40] <%Nobrev> @天使42199 new zealand
[1:32:42] <%Divryne> It's proximity based apparently.
[1:32:43] <%CerberusDriver> @coreybom I guess, if you wanna see a differerent take. thought yoiu meant starting with DmC cause thatd be nuts
[1:32:45] <%Divryne> Not hitbox.
[1:32:47] <+Clik404> @coreybom ehhh, it’s an aight game, if you haven’t done a Vergil run yet, then that’s probably gonna be a better time
[1:32:47] <%Trinity5> @love_plays we've known this for years
[1:32:52] <b1gboss007> @coreybom nah, definitive edition is a ok game but it lack everything that makes dmc dmc
[1:32:53] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Ps4, its out at midnight, he bought it off the new zealand store
[1:32:54] <%lewdskeletor13> This game takes the better parts of DmC and uses them more effectively
[1:33:00] <HaikuRaichu> I am so exited what Itsuno-san decides to make after this game is released
[1:33:03] <love_plays> @Trinity5 this is the first i've heard confirmation though
[1:33:03] <%FrustratedAF> 🍆
[1:33:07] <gustavozxd> JC hotbox was always shitty
[1:33:08] <+atlasbot1> 2 number 9s
[1:33:08] <+Clik404> @coreybom in DMC3 I mean
[1:33:08] <waifoong98> @b1gboss007 might need to rephrase that Kappa
[1:33:11] <BlacSoul> You gotta he fast for an S @angriestpat
[1:33:23] <%joylent_blue> time does NOT affect ranking
[1:33:27] <+天使42199> FAYST
[1:33:30] <keksisblyat> Itsuno has also stated that he does actually like DmC
[1:33:30] <%TheFilth> S for Sonic
[1:33:34] <stirlingw17> did the demo come out with some new stuff?
[1:33:35] <%Big_Dream> how long until the dmc 5 porn is out
[1:33:35] <SunsetJack> There is like mini things to do to gain more points for higher rank.
[1:33:40] <+天使42199> imaDisgust FAYST
[1:33:41] <Drusain> SPEED
[1:33:41] <+imporia_> it does
[1:33:41] <+VektorTroika> Move fast baby, don't be slow!
[1:33:42] <+FlubbedPig> @AngriestPat You think any of the individual Breakers are as good as Devil Bringer's grab?
[1:33:42] <%ThatGuyfromMars> move fast baby don't be slow
[1:33:43] <%CerberusDriver> @keksisblyat He worked on it, of course he likes it?
[1:33:44] <Fujiwara_92> TIME DOESN'T AFFECT RANKING THO l
[1:33:45] <Kalcom> 0 seconds
[1:33:45] <%topendbuzz> s is for speed
[1:33:45] <majindusto> GOTTA GO FAST
[1:33:46] <+honorable_captain_garlock> it does a little bit
[1:33:47] <SnaKemuho> faSSSt
[1:33:47] <%bestwaifuritsu> Move fast baby, dont be slow LUL
[1:33:48] <tmix1600> @coreybom DmC gameplay wise is like DMC5, for story id say 3 anc/or 4
[1:33:48] <silvcrest> It does
[1:33:49] <BlacSoul> You get a bonus for speed
[1:33:50] <+Clik404> @angriestpat time don’t effect your rank
[1:33:50] <%TheMilhouseExperience> And don’t get hit more than 3 times
[1:33:52] <+atlasbot1> DmC isnt a bad game its just a bad devil may cry game
[1:33:54] <%Solidus_113> you get a red orb bonus for completing under 10 minutes
[1:33:54] <leole11> no shit itsuno liked DmC, he made half the game!
[1:33:55] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@rawrd)
[1:33:56] <Kalcom> Just play good fucko
[1:33:57] <+honorable_captain_garlock> you get like 500 points if you go fast
[1:33:57] <SunsetJack> Like, popping all the ballons gives you a bonus.
[1:33:57] <waifoong98> @keksisblyat well guess what, there is a thing call PR
[1:33:59] <%joylent_blue> i took like 20 minutes and got an S rank
[1:33:59] <%Kravedarknesss> @big_dream I'm sure there's already plenty
[1:34:00] <asurite_warrior> jeeze I was expecting the face view to be white with spuuge when pat was playing this.
[1:34:01] <keksisblyat> @CerberusDriver true
[1:34:02] <%Nobrev> I don't think time affects ranking. you can see what points you got where if you hit details on the ranking screen iirc @AngriestPat
[1:34:03] <%TheSpiritof2277> Hits are more of the factor now, I think?
[1:34:12] <%Trinity5> DmC vanilla is pretty poopy but the definitive edition is aight
[1:34:12] <silvcrest> 3 on me
[1:34:16] <+imporia_> going fast gives you a bonus
[1:34:17] <tmix1600> All DMC5 is is DmC meets DMC4
[1:34:18] <PsychoFlash1> @keksisblyat that's like lars ulrich saying he still likes st. anger, even if it's true doesn't mean much
[1:34:21] <stirlingw17> did they change the demo and add just new arms or are there other things?
[1:34:34] <BlacSoul> Speed doesn’t hurt but it DEFINITELY helps
[1:34:36] <waifoong98> @tmix1600 bullshit
[1:34:38] <love_plays> from the analyses i've seen, DmC would be looked upon more favorably if that one jackass didn't poison the well by shittalking DMC fans
[1:34:40] <DirtyPopcornJ> Wait is Nero's awkward run because of all the arms weight? That's a nice detail
[1:34:40] <%zerocruz> You can buy abilities now
[1:34:40] <+namillus> @tmix1600 It has taunts. Your argument is invalid.
[1:34:41] <+Clik404> CAPGOD CAPGOD
[1:34:43] <%joylent_blue> theres so little DmC in this game thats not even worth mentioning lol

[1:35:10] <%Trinity5> SourPls
[1:35:12] <%CerberusDriver> This game takes from DmC: Slo mo and a training mode. wowee so much influence
[1:35:12] <%Starlight_Gamer> is it just me or does the combat seem slow?
[1:35:12] <b1gboss007> nah dmc5 is dmc4 meets the REengine realistic artstyle
[1:35:13] <KinduVborrd> Nero has Round Trip and Real Impact now

[1:35:19] <%Trinity5> when did Pat get BTT emotes?
[1:35:19] <coreybom> @leole11 just cause he worked on DmC doesn't mean he automatically liked it. he just likes it. remember, he worked on dmc2.
[1:35:20] <caol2017> HEY NERO WANNA SS
[1:35:21] <+timblenaut> a boivin denied his SSS
[1:35:22] <%Agami23> omg. punchline is just round trip

[1:35:25] <+luketrapwalker> Stylish gameplay is very stylish
[1:35:26] <+Clik404> I swear between this and RE2, it’s like Capcom decided to single handedly save the AAA industry
[1:35:27] <%Dioliciouss> this song is the best thing about the game right, and i don't mean that in a bad way
[1:35:33] <+天使42199> I mean the art style looks more DmC then classic devil may cry tbh
[1:35:35] <bearwagon> why u ppl taking the fishing line its obviously not a real worm
[1:35:39] <+namillus> Oh my god punchline what the fuck

[1:36:03] <%CerberusDriver> @天使42199 it doesn't though, have you seen them compared? DmC looks like Unreal 3 engine with red and blue slapped everywhere

[1:36:28] <robin2098> @angriestpat try punchline break in air
[1:36:30] <+天使42199> @CerberusDriver Im talking about how they made characters look more realistic instead of 3d anime ish like in the old dmcs
[1:36:40] <%Kravedarknesss> DMC always has the coolest dorks
[1:36:51] <PsychoFlash1> @Wizpig megaman 11 last year too, just overall greatness

[1:37:16] <+namillus> @VektorTroika This is why you get the Deluxe edition so Dante's battle music is Devils Never Cry.
[1:37:17] <%FrostMass22> You cannot kill Randy, he is subhuman

[1:38:23] <majindusto> Feet Status = WET
[1:38:24] <+VektorTroika> @namillus charging for the good musics? daylight robbery. absolutely criminal.
[1:38:24] <%The_Esquana> the air one tho

[1:38:28] <%Trinity5> @EastwindGuru specific devil bringer shit, ye
[1:38:29] <+天使42199> @CerberusDriver I see.
[1:38:29] <+AncientToco> Feet 👀
[1:38:31] <%KaironFortressKnight> @angriestpat Overtures palm is context sensitive. If you launch an enemy first, the palm will be an upper. If the enemy is down, a ground pound.
[1:38:31] <Guardiansaiyan> GivePLZ CurseLit TakeNRG
[1:38:33] <+Th3SmartAlec> SO GOOOD
[1:38:34] <%jiin6> Pat's got the trench foot
[1:38:34] <tank7013> There HAS to be more level there. That was a red orb cluster right by the stairs
[1:38:44] <+atlasbot1> Dick status = HARD
[1:38:44] <+honorable_captain_garlock> airborne gerbera in this room is really good instant sss
[1:38:47] <+Hell_Raz0r> the GOOD SHIT
[1:38:51] <+namillus> @VektorTroika More like "would you like to replace any of the battle tracks with THIS HUGE SELECTION of classic themes?"
[1:38:51] <+Th3SmartAlec> YEEEE
[1:38:53] <krymzen5> oh they def skip a section
[1:38:54] <+atlasbot1> Ball status = EMPTY
[1:38:55] <stirlingw17> give em some of the good shit
[1:38:56] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Pat would you say you’re motivated?
[1:38:57] <%Trinity5> @EastwindGuru oh wait i mean. you have wire snatch at all times if that was what you were asking
[1:38:58] <%Plague_Nurse> This reminds me of DMC3 Mission 1
[1:38:59] <%Fruitywhompus> oof
[1:38:59] <Reanimator83> Pats stewing in his own juices
[1:39:00] <+EastwindGuru> @Trinity5 I mean specifically the "get over here" shit.
[1:39:00] <nina9669> F
[1:39:01] <%lewdskeletor13> This gives Pat the BIG PENIS
[1:39:02] <reonome> BANG BANG BANG
[1:39:03] <%Doodle_Taco> bang bang bang
[1:39:03] <xeros720> you'll get that SSS one day pat
[1:39:03] <%zerocruz> NUT
[1:39:05] <artoflec> yeaahh DmC had more "realistically" proportioned faces and stuff but that game still just looked bad in a lot of places.
[1:39:05] <Ropcord> YOU GOT HIT START OVER
[1:39:09] <%joylent_blue> @AngriestPat Gerbera's break move in the air is fantastic
[1:39:11] <+EastwindGuru> @Trinity5 Yep, thats what I mean
[1:39:11] <%TheFilth> Pat's desperate for that air guitar
[1:39:12] <%The_Esquana> Nero empties his balls on grandpas
[1:39:13] <+JollyHeracross> TAUNT CANCELS
[1:39:20] <+namillus> Wire Snatch not being tied to any of Nero's breakers is a perfect choice.
[1:39:21] <+VektorTroika> @namillus how big of a price difference is this exactly?
[1:39:21] <%Trinity5> @EastwindGuru yep you have it forever
[1:39:21] <DaHaLoJeDi> So according to the new RE2make Lore, Dante is Leon Blanco and Vergil is Wesker Azul
[1:39:26] <LazyLudens> @AngriestPat Ride punch line and hit enemies with it
[1:39:28] <Foxbane44> hey everyone, who else is super excited for release
[1:39:30] <%Divryne> YEYEYE.
[1:39:30] <DirtyPopcornJ> close
[1:39:31] <waifoong98> Taunt after taunt doesn't give style....
[1:39:31] <+VektorTroika> talk to the hand
[1:39:38] <+jkobe34> you haven't done overtures break skill yet
[1:39:40] <+namillus> @VektorTroika Over here in the UK it's like a tenner for fifteen? tracks
[1:39:40] <%Doodle_Taco> @dahalojedi LUL LUL LUL
[1:39:40] <DaHaLoJeDi> Do with that info what you will
[1:39:41] <alrobot2014> @AngriestPat you can jump over to the next building with air taunt and gerbera
[1:39:43] <%CerberusDriver> Taunt after taunt doesnt give much style but its FUN
[1:39:43] <PsychoFlash1> @DaHaLoJeDi holy SHIT
[1:39:46] <+EastwindGuru> @Trinity5 That's really good.
[1:39:47] <+天使42199> @artoflec of course. all im saying is if this game is taking anything from DmC it would seem to be the "realistic" character looks. the characters in this game dont look anime like dmc 4
[1:39:49] <%Plague_Nurse> everyone with sense is excited for dmcv
[1:39:50] <randomp141> @AngriestPat Suplex the giant teddy bear or this play is invalidated.
[1:39:51] <%Trinity5> @EastwindGuru fuck yeah it is
[1:39:51] <chase959> full game or demo?
[1:39:53] <Guardiansaiyan> HEY! Final Fantasy XIII
[1:39:54] <love_plays> i love that Overture lets him do that palm thing from Psychonauts in a cool and powerful way
[1:39:56] <Inebriateddonut> Well maybe 2 or 3 just space them out
[1:40:03] <%Kravedarknesss> I love how when nero claps it actually sounds like he's got a prosthetic
[1:40:03] <tmix1600> Like Pat cares if Taunts dont help
[1:40:05] <%The_Esquana> that boss grab with overture tho
[1:40:05] <Guardiansaiyan> Didn't know you were in Gran Pusle @AngriestPat
[1:40:06] <Archmortal> you can definitely do more than one a fight.
[1:40:08] <artoflec> @天使42199 yeah, and some of the grosser fleshier design from RE games
[1:40:08] <waifoong98> Basically do many things in between before you taunt again.
[1:40:08] <SnaKemuho> you gotta do it off the balcony
[1:40:09] <Ebola_Beetle> Real life sucks man, i wanna play a white haired anime semi-hobo with a huge sword, twin guns and a pizza fetish
[1:40:09] <%TheFilth> run through combo list, then taunt to refresh
[1:40:09] <Foxbane44> so how easy is the revving compared to 4?
[1:40:11] <%joylent_blue> @AngriestPat Gerbera's break move in the air is different from when you're on the ground
[1:40:14] <Fujiwara_92> 2 or 3 if u space them out yeah
[1:40:15] <+JayEarly> @randomp141 I don't think that arm is in the demo
[1:40:15] <+namillus> I would contest that DmC has a "realistic" art style. It's going for something comic-booky IMO.
[1:40:16] <+Th3SmartAlec> @AngriestPat That jump can be made from the balacony with Gerbera dodge
[1:40:17] <+luketrapwalker> Does taunting add to the combo ranking too?
[1:40:19] <+天使42199> @artoflec yeah
[1:40:19] <ramix_the_red> im so hype
[1:40:22] <krymzen5> use em like any combo move, after a cycle u can again
[1:40:24] <Downcom1ng> Air taunts and gerbera dashes man
[1:40:28] <%mercado94> oh boy
[1:40:31] <+AngriestAngryArtist> watchu say?
[1:40:32] <+namillus> But yes, DMC5 does look more realistic while keeping the Flashy Style.
[1:40:37] <%Fruitywhompus> WHO SAID THAT
[1:40:38] <b1gboss007> @angel42199 the realistic look is has to do more with the RE engine being good for that, that with DmC artstyle tho
[1:40:39] <Reanimator83> I need to see some art of Elmo duel welding Ebony and Ivory
[1:40:42] <majindusto> Oh no, Final Fantasy XIII, AHHHHHHHHHH!
[1:40:46] <JazzyJulZ> @AngriestPat Taunts dont boost style by much, but thry also completely prevent the gauge from dropping. Even if it's decayed
[1:40:46] <%Mornaka> Then buy shuffle
[1:40:49] <stirlingw17> shuffle sucked though
[1:40:49] <randomp141> @JayEarly Ah, didn't see it said demo there.
[1:40:51] <coreybom> wow, I forgotten just how contentious DmC could be. it could really bring out the salt in everyone.
[1:40:52] <arkv01> I should've been the one to fill your dark hole with PIZZZZZZA
[1:40:55] <%CerberusDriver> Taunts after taunts is fun tho
[1:40:56] <silvcrest> You've got enough for it @AngriestPat
[1:40:56] <+Th3SmartAlec> He
[1:40:57] <TFxGod_> is this a new 2nd demo?
[1:41:01] <Foxbane44> is pat and woolie going to do an lp on this in march

[1:41:19] <TakesGuts> lmao
[1:41:19] <+天使42199> @b1gboss007 Yeah capcom has been doing a lot of games with the more realistic look so its liekly that
[1:41:20] <%ThePuddingDead> lol
[1:41:25] <%CerberusDriver> @coreybom its just trolls saying "uhm ackshully DMC5 is DmC2 cause of x reason" and getting people riled
[1:41:26] <waifoong98> @TFxGod_ it adds another arm and the customisation menu but that's about it...

[1:42:36] <arkv01> if pat and woolie stream it together, one of them can't play so it stands to reason they're probs gonna stream it separately

[1:42:40] <%Trinity5> @tank7013 sajamStare
[1:42:44] <%ThePuddingDead> i heard that!

[1:42:46] <%Plague_Nurse> Nero, Dante, and V fighting demons on that big demon tree, shirtless in the rain
[1:42:46] <%dking0000> It actually was hype at the start

[1:42:49] <%TheFilth> it always had that
[1:42:51] <%Hilleltaco> It always got more
[1:42:51] <alrobot2014> it already did
[1:42:52] <tank7013> @Trinity5 LUL
[1:42:53] <majindusto> Ahhh
[1:42:53] <crimsonsaens> It always had two hits, Pat
[1:42:54] <Hydrapissed> Golf swing
[1:42:54] <SnaKemuho> FAKE FAN
[1:42:54] <%KaironFortressKnight> It always did
[1:42:55] <%joylent_blue> krymzen5 and a new breaker arm
[1:42:56] <+kuervojones> Which engine is this?
[1:42:56] <MONSTR_UwU> PogChamp
[1:42:56] <arkv01> and they're no longer shackled by the twoman LP rule
[1:42:59] <Vashido22> It always did tho
[1:43:00] <Coystick> I will live in that menu
[1:43:00] <haisho> I hope somoene clipped that
[1:43:01] <b1gboss007> @tmix1600 ok, now that's bait
[1:43:01] <%Hilleltaco> Exceed does that to everything
[1:43:01] <waifoong98> REVVVVVV
[1:43:01] <fruit_pie_the_magician> TIMED
[1:43:03] <%joylent_blue> it did in 4 tho
[1:43:03] <+天使42199> @Wrashis id say mvc i
[1:43:03] <LowHighKang> @tmix1600 it also sacrificed 60 fps. DmC was 30 fps with dips when it came out
[1:43:04] <%Nobrev> this makes my nut become the big nut
[1:43:06] <+namillus> @arkv01 Remember the DMC4 play? Woolie was Nero and Pat was Dante
[1:43:06] <DirtyPopcornJ> oh Pat
[1:43:06] <Archmortal> that's gonna be so badass with max exceed
[1:43:06] <Vashido22> LUL
[1:43:07] <%Plague_Nurse> It sounds like Vergil's teleports
[1:43:08] <mr_slaide> Everyone shut up!
[1:43:11] <krymzen5> @joylent_blue hoping to see the old 3rd combo back
[1:43:11] <%jiin6> CRAZY TALK IS STRONG
[1:43:12] <+RC_S3kshun8> So who is the main character now? I'm out of the loop guys
[1:43:12] <tungstenviper> LUL
[1:43:13] <%TheFilth> big gasms are bad for memory
[1:43:13] <%TheMilhouseExperience> It had two hits in4 Pat.
[1:43:19] <fruit_pie_the_magician> ALLEGEDLY
[1:43:19] <%bestwaifuritsu> If Nero trained Shuffling he'd be fucking Air Tricking just like daddy
[1:43:21] <%Kravedarknesss> @kuervojones the RE engine sane as REmake 2 and RE7
[1:43:22] <%mercado94> #FAKE_FAN
[1:43:22] <tmix1600> Because prior DMC HAD to bank off graphics, DmC excelled in visuals without
[1:43:25] <silvcrest> Nero from 4 @RC_S3kshun8
[1:43:26] <+namillus> Also the rendering on the air hike platform is THE BEST.
[1:43:27] <%joylent_blue> krymzen5 i think its been seen in trailers, so VoHiYo
[1:43:28] <%ElenaManetta> Pat you HAVE to know what you're talking about. You're my primary source of info, I never do extra research.
[1:43:29] <%TheSpiritof2277> @RC_S3kshun8 Still Nero carrying the legacy
[1:43:43] <artoflec> @tmix1600 LUL i just said it sacrificed the art design, look at all its enemies
[1:43:45] <+RC_S3kshun8> Ahh gotcha. Thanks guys! Why is he missing an arm?
[1:43:47] <krymzen5> @joylent_blue hell ye sweet
[1:43:58] <%joylent_blue> RC_S3kshun8 story reasons
[1:43:58] <Ropcord> totally not virgil stole his cool demon arm
[1:43:59] <%Demon_Shadow4> is it weird that i like neros voice actor more than dante's?
[1:44:00] <EmptyFist> Song SLAPS
[1:44:00] <+Th3SmartAlec> yeah, go hime big demon man
[1:44:02] <+namillus> @RC_S3kshun8 Someone MORE MOTIVATED than him took it.
[1:44:06] <tmix1600> Nah enemies were fine
[1:44:07] <person181> it kinda sounds like nero says "no homo"
[1:44:12] <%Trinity5> @Demon_Shadow4 i mean johnny yong bosch does good work
[1:44:14] <%Plague_Nurse> f
[1:44:15] <+timblenaut> lightning explosion in herE?
[1:44:16] <ebonifragaria> Yuck it up all you want!

[1:44:32] <%dking0000> As much as everything in this game kicks ass the Blue Rose changes are my favorite
[1:44:34] <+Th3SmartAlec> meh, doesnt work well with this boss
[1:44:38] <%CerberusDriver> whered he say fuck
[1:44:39] <%Kravedarknesss> @jiin6 he needed more power
[1:44:39] <b_ikki> yeah he calls nero a motherfucker
[1:44:44] <T_Sasquatch> I got an intial final rank of B then eventually got a Total A ranking. FeelsGoodMan
[1:44:44] <neggly> Where's the Paigster today?
[1:44:45] <+RC_S3kshun8> Thanks again guys! Sorry for the dumb questions
[1:44:51] <artoflec> @Trinity5 i think he's got tbh ela12
[1:44:53] <%Demon_Shadow4> @Trinity5 Hell yeah he does loved him in bleach and zerro from umc3
[1:44:54] <tmix1600> DMC1 takes worst designs easy
[1:44:54] <LowHighKang> Chat, has Pat done Rocket Shoryuken yet?
[1:44:54] <+Th3SmartAlec> OVERTURN
[1:44:56] <+RC_S3kshun8> I haven't really played DMC since 1 and 2
[1:44:59] <+VektorTroika> splat
[1:45:00] <%TheFilth> only charging attacks it seems
[1:45:04] <majindusto> Yeah, Enemies in DmC are so awful and forgetable
[1:45:05] <+天使42199> @RC_S3kshun8 dont worry about it lol.
[1:45:06] <tmix1600> Then debately 2
[1:45:06] <%Trinity5> @Demon_Shadow4 the mans is the persona 4 protagonist
[1:45:06] <Ropcord> 😡 EAT DIRT 😡
[1:45:13] <%joylent_blue> RC_S3kshun8 nows the best time to get back in :D
[1:45:22] <+namillus> Blue Rose + Punchline is the shit
[1:45:23] <tmix1600> 4 was pretty meh too
[1:45:24] <RekknLIVE> if you played 2 you've played them all
[1:45:24] <+天使42199> @RC_S3kshun8 and you really should play 3 at some point
[1:45:28] <%Doodle_Taco> F
[1:45:29] <T_Sasquatch> the camera is heavily focused on the boss, kind off a mess to move around in the enviroment
[1:45:29] <%Plague_Nurse> f
[1:45:31] <%TheFilth> muh royal guard
[1:45:34] <artoflec> @tmix1600 the remake has a giant rat and a fat guy made of porcelain, easily number 1 worst in the franchise
[1:45:36] <krymzen5> i liked 4, but 3s the highlight
[1:45:37] <%Demon_Shadow4> @Trinity5 seriously? did not know that!! Good Shit!
[1:45:37] <%TheSpiritof2277> @RC_S3kshun8 Hey it's better to ask questions than blindly speculate, lol! Hope you enjoy the game when you get to it
[1:45:39] <silvcrest> F to S
[1:45:40] <majindusto> 4 was better tho
[1:45:43] <FruitBasketVidya> do you still have iframes when you jump
[1:45:50] <LowHighKang> @T_Sasquatch better to have the camera on the boss then not
[1:45:52] <%joylent_blue> yes FruitBasketVidya
[1:45:53] <%CerberusDriver> REPLAYABILITY
[1:45:55] <Ropcord> nothing more stylish than whiffing a drop kick, just ask shaggy
[1:45:59] <FruitBasketVidya> moce
[1:46:00] <+Th3SmartAlec> GIVE HIM A TASTE
[1:46:00] <krymzen5> 4 had great combat, but awful lvl design
[1:46:02] <FruitBasketVidya> nice, even
[1:46:03] <%Trinity5> @Demon_Shadow4 well i mean the p4 protag doesn't really speak so it's fair to not know that lmao
[1:46:05] <artoflec> the drop kick taunt elaGasm
[1:46:05] <arkv01> YA GOTTA BE KIDDING...
[1:46:05] <randomp141> @AngriestPat Isn't it cute? Go pet it.
[1:46:06] <gustavozxd> 4 enemies are iffy at times but the combat man
[1:46:07] <+WaywardSera> did he say "You've got to be kidding me"
[1:46:09] <deviljhojho94> B A D A S s
[1:46:10] <tmix1600> Debatable
[1:46:12] <b_ikki> you can snatch him while he charges and he cartoon drags you with him

[1:46:22] <+JayEarly> @WaywardSera yep
[1:46:23] <waifoong98> I would think Pat would be better with Nero but I guess Nah.
[1:46:31] <+RC_S3kshun8> That effect looks like Bayonetta hair lol
[1:46:32] <+Th3SmartAlec> Pat. You may want to run from that
[1:46:35] <b_ikki> parry with sword like a man
[1:46:37] <Ropcord> who needs arms when you have a gun
[1:46:38] <LowHighKang> @T_Sasquatch honestly i've never played an action game with a foolproof camera. You just hope it's not absolute shit

[1:49:46] <Rexenexus> Matto-san said it was Devil Hunter but they changed stuff around
[1:49:46] <%Hilleltaco> The first demo had less fights, so you didn't have much to work with
[1:49:46] <+mechslayer71> How do you know for sure tho?

[1:49:54] <ebonifragaria> Elmo love DMC
[1:49:54] <%Dingus_Tickler> @fujiwara_92 It’s hard to S Rank weak enemies, since they die so quickly. That is prob what he is talking about
[1:49:56] <majindusto> Good Elmo Time
[1:50:01] <Guardiansaiyan> GivePLZ CurseLit TakeNRG
[1:50:01] <Ropcord> did pat ever have any brain juice?
[1:50:03] <+SoarFlyer> oops brain juice machine broke
[1:50:05] <LowHighKang> @Talbz You can't get S ranks on auto-assist mode.
[1:50:07] <konami2010> from the horse you can jump to the top of the bridge
[1:50:12] <Rygart121> SourPls
[1:50:13] <+VektorTroika> @TheFilth and yet they still rate the music low cuz they can't get style up high enough for it to kick in LUL
[1:50:15] <tmix1600> You dumbasses forgot how easy DMC1 S's were huh
[1:50:15] <nlizik> @Angrestpat hey this is my first stream
[1:50:15] <Parapattern> "Cuz I'm a stupid fucking cat and I don't know what it means to be sad!"

[1:50:29] <Jslicerx> Pat, the balloons! @angriestpat
[1:50:36] <artoflec> @tmix1600 your dumb ass forgot that game came out almost 2 decades ago huh
[1:50:39] <+天使42199> @Demon_Shadow4 I mean if you like the style of game, you WILL like p5 im pretty sure. but again do you like long ass dialogue heavy jrpgs ?
[1:50:43] <%Keyd00d> SAVAGE
[1:50:47] <gustavozxd> dmc1 S rank only counts time and red orbs
[1:50:48] <%CerberusDriver> @artoflec stop feeding
[1:50:51] <Ropcord> SourPls SourPls SourPls
[1:50:52] <+namillus> Man, comparing Gerbera Aerial Break to, say, that one overhead swing on Arbiter is real interesting.
[1:50:54] <%joylent_blue> don't feed trolls guys
[1:50:56] <%FrustratedAF> chat how hot is nico?
[1:50:58] <BigNerdSam> TAUNT
[1:50:59] <gustavozxd> dmc1 S ranks are whack
[1:51:01] <$Big_King_Coconut> pull muh devil trigger
[1:51:06] <%Nobrev> @AngriestPat popping the balloons increases ranking at the end
[1:51:07] <+AngriestAngryArtist> dose red orbs dou!
[1:51:08] <Charlie_Decker> someone should mention Pat can dodge cancel out of the forward/back move for a neat backstep
[1:51:10] <tmix1600> Ninja Gaiden also was out, no excuses
[1:51:11] <%Trinity5> @FrustratedAF I want her to hug me and tell me that I'm loved
[1:51:12] <+JayEarly> @FrustratedAF VERY
[1:51:13] <%Dingus_Tickler> @tmix1600 atpRtsd4
[1:51:15] <+namillus> Yes, Gerbera can get you a free Triple S. ... If you use it in a confined space so it just keeps hitting things.
[1:51:22] <+luketrapwalker> That song was pretty dope as well.
[1:51:24] <krymzen5> dmc1 s ranks are all about those hidden orbs nd speed
[1:51:30] <+namillus> And it's not really "free" because you're down a Gerbera Charge.
[1:51:30] <Dral54> You can totally shoot in sync with the bang band bang
[1:51:33] <artoflec> @tmix1600 that game came out in 2004
[1:51:33] <%Demon_Shadow4> @天使42199 their alright I mean i did sit through ffxv and grindid to lvl 99 lol
[1:51:34] <person181> no
[1:51:35] <%ThePuddingDead> mhmmm
[1:51:36] <%ElenaManetta> no i blinked for 10 seconds
[1:51:36] <%joylent_blue> Gerbera's air break in that smaller room is fucking Kreygasm
[1:51:37] <Guardiansaiyan> ???
[1:51:37] <T_Sasquatch> yup
[1:51:37] <stabbityrabbit> @Trinity5 Same man. Same.
[1:51:39] <DirtyPopcornJ> parried?
[1:51:40] <ScreamingMeat> Gerbera's aerial charge attack seems to be designed for small enclosed rooms.
[1:51:41] <thecrispyones> yes
[1:51:42] <Fujiwara_92> yup
[1:51:43] <Jslicerx> @angriestpat what about the secrets?
[1:51:44] <popcultureaficionado> this would be better with keyblades
[1:51:45] <+LethalPlacebo> It's obvious which elements were kept here from DmC, like the camera, voice yelling savage, and a couple other things.
[1:51:45] <waifoong98> I miss Area based theme.
[1:51:46] <T_Sasquatch> i think clashes are back
[1:51:47] <+AngriestAngryArtist> rocketo panch!
[1:51:49] <tmix1600> Bruh DMC1 literally had SINGLE ROOM MISSIONS
[1:51:49] <%Mornaka> I was alt tabbed
[1:51:50] <gustavozxd> holy water is a legit S rank strat for dmc1 LuL
[1:51:50] <%3xgilly> THATS RAD
[1:51:55] <majindusto> "accidentally"
[1:51:55] <video0_0> accidentally parried
[1:51:55] <%Mornaka> not gonna lie
[1:51:57] <+namillus> Yeah, so it's BIG STYLE - but ONLY if you use it in the right spot.
[1:52:05] <%ThePuddingDead> teehhehehheee
[1:52:05] <%Trinity5> time to listen to devil trigger for 6 hours on loop again
[1:52:06] <+天使42199> @Demon_Shadow4 oh ff15 huh ? I havent played that one lol you enjoyed it ?
[1:52:08] <%jiin6> Your grade does not reflect real world value, only how cool your song is
[1:52:12] <SweetestEggplant> @AngriestPat have you tried riding the arm in combat yet?
[1:52:15] <Ropcord> S I C K S K I L L S
[1:52:18] <tmix1600> DMC3 also pretty easy too
[1:52:18] <%TheFilth> no air guitar NotLikeThis
[1:52:20] <+namillus> Unlike Arbiter's big three-hit overhead in DmC which is just lel free S and more if you catch multiple enemies in it
[1:52:21] <%superc37> @angriestpat lemmi tell ya as someone playing the demo right now, GEBRA AND PUNCH TIME ARE FUNKING BAE
[1:52:23] <+luketrapwalker> This song is perfect
[1:52:25] <%ThePuddingDead> that makes me fuggin smile
[1:52:25] <%Keyd00d> sick

[1:52:40] <%ElenaManetta> its ok
[1:52:41] <deviljhojho94> this fucking game
[1:52:42] <artoflec> Aqulia in DmC was basically holding a button down to get S rank
[1:52:42] <person181> ps4 demo
[1:52:44] <Dementedpenguin> Kreygasm
[1:52:45] <%TheFilth> I think the guitar taunt might be an SSS only
[1:52:45] <deviljhojho94> im edging right now you guys
[1:52:46] <%jiin6> he lacks the 3rd S
[1:52:48] <%Keyd00d> Capcom's on a fuckin roll
[1:52:50] <ScreamingMeat> @AngriestPat I didn't like the Devil Trigger song at first but it has grown on me

[1:53:46] <%jiin6> one S Pat?
[1:53:47] <%awsomesaucekirby> cheer600 hello darkness my old friend. So today at class I came in to find out the grade on my c++ assignment. I was pretty proud of the work I did, I used what she taught us to create a beautiful wreath of code, complex, but simplified, it did everything she asked for and more. And she said it wasn't right because I didn't do it the way she wanted. I used the right methods, and used it to calculate what she wanted, and give specific details. I reached a whole new kind of anger tonight.
[1:53:47] <%Trinity5> @mik255 yeah he keeps snatch forever and sword combos are the same
[1:53:51] <+天使42199> @Demon_Shadow4 oh shit. sounds like a good time then. might get around to playing it eventually lol
[1:53:56] <exalt4747> Finally got twitch working again.
[1:54:01] <+PeaceCentennial> Would what Pat said about buying 10 Geberas even work if you can only bring 4 arms into a mission?
[1:54:05] <randomp141> @AngriestPat Play Total Overdose for shiggles.
[1:54:06] <monzy101> Is jump canceling in the demo?
[1:54:08] <%BlitzChocula> ah yes, just a custom mechanized arm just lying around for Nero.
[1:54:09] <%LogothX> oh nooo he cursseddd
[1:54:09] <%Keyd00d> good shit
[1:54:10] <%joylent_blue> yes monzy101
[1:54:14] <Oqzar> no DT moves or summon swords
[1:54:14] <+mik255> i thought snatch was on an arm?
[1:54:16] <+blademaster247> @AngriestPat I thought the demo wasn't not out til tomorrow?
[1:54:17] <+luketrapwalker> PogChamp
[1:54:17] <waifoong98> Using Enders at Starters LUL

[1:54:28] <LeonSteel> THE GOOD SHIT Kreygasm
[1:54:29] <tmix1600> I want taunt selection not rng
[1:54:34] <ebonifragaria> The stump is powerful
[1:54:35] <tank7013> @mik255 Pretty much all he's missing without arms are his devil bringer grabs which are a breaker now
[1:54:36] <%CerberusDriver> this game aint even out yet
[1:54:36] <%Big_Dream> Vergil wanted neros arm so he took it
[1:54:39] <Psyramics> its tomorrow in new zealand
[1:54:44] <deviljhojho94> my dick is so hard PepeHands i want to cry

[1:55:46] <+Rust_Wick> spoiler pat is vergil

[1:55:49] <+mik255> virgil will probly have dlc called downfall
[1:55:49] <%ThePuddingDead> who might be final boss?
[1:55:49] <%Plague_Nurse> most likely
[1:55:49] <krymzen5> i forsee an unlock or dlc vergil
[1:55:51] <+namillus> I feel like Vergil is Nero's final boss FOR SURE.
[1:55:51] <tmix1600> Vergil is a enemy but not playable
[1:55:52] <%joylent_blue> there will be dlc if anything
[1:55:52] <%Keyd00d> HMMM
[1:55:53] <%lewdskeletor13> Do you know something we don’t? apatSmug apatSmug
[1:55:57] <%Trinity5> HA FUCK YEAH
[1:55:57] <person181> i think you mean the seed of sparda

[1:55:58] <Arweynn> DMC V (irgil)
[1:55:59] <+天使42199> @Demon_Shadow4 ah okay, yeah Ill try to pick it up down the line
[1:56:00] <%TheSpiritof2277> LUL
[1:56:00] <+JuiceBlox> SPOILERS
[1:56:00] <VentusHero> by that, u mean the VERGILMOBILE, RIGHT?
[1:56:00] <+blademaster247> Vergil's seed is in the game at the very least
[1:56:02] <artoflec> Vergil will finally be cool again PogChamp
[1:56:02] <EBT93> They’ll make him playable in the Special Edition
[1:56:04] <%joylent_blue> PAT PLEASE
[1:56:05] <%Divryne> VERGIN CONFIRMED.
[1:56:06] <Inebriateddonut> Also bracer of guy who took arm
[1:56:06] <%ECRead> well then
[1:56:07] <+namillus> Dante and V might get different final bosses.
[1:56:07] <%afronooch> DANIEL-SAN
[1:56:09] <+Talbz> You can tell its Dan even without editing
[1:56:10] <%Afterman_> yee that audio pitch was awesome
[1:56:11] <%lewdskeletor13> DansGame DansGame DansGame PAT
[1:56:13] <%Wrashis> but was daniel southward sick
[1:56:16] <%poweredscoot> WHO CAN SAY?
[1:56:17] <%terminallyCapriciousz> Vergil will appear as an unplayable ANTAGONIST in the main game, and will likely return as a playable character in DMCV: Special Edition
[1:56:17] <+JollyHeracross> quick someone mail the flu to daniel southward 8 months ago
[1:56:18] <%Plague_Nurse> It's as predictable as the kh3 ending
[1:56:19] <BigNerdSam> What if Vergil cloned himself a bunch of times like Xehanort?
[1:56:20] <Dvvolf> but will he ever be playable that's a better question
[1:56:20] <$Order_of_Mystery> is it too much to hope Vergil is a good guy for once? or am I missing the point
[1:56:21] <mr_slaide> Reminder that Virgil had more sex than Leon.
[1:56:24] <%jiin6> final boss arena is the Virgil Mobile
[1:56:27] <Theworld732> I mean he is in the game but the question is whether or not he is playable
[1:56:27] <Ropcord> RESTART 😡
[1:56:30] <%Sephrim> Good luck Pat, I gotta go into work. I will be trying out this demo soon too
[1:56:33] <honmaheadbutt> Well pat just [Crazy Talk]’d Vergil out of the game
[1:56:36] <+luketrapwalker> run it back
[1:56:36] <+namillus> @BigNerdSam that's just Doppleganger tho
[1:56:38] <krymzen5> ye rip S
[1:56:39] <Kalcom> cmooon crazy talk
[1:56:41] <tmix1600> Only people who think Vergil was ever cool still are sasuke fans
[1:56:42] <%TheFilth> @Order_of_Mystery imagine how Dante must feel
[1:56:50] <%BlitzChocula> Vergil won't be in the game, but his nobody and heartless and younger version from an alternate timeline will be :^)
[1:56:51] <T_Sasquatch> i still dont understand how to do neros red queen explosions
[1:56:51] <Caivyre> BIG CHOKE
[1:56:52] <tank7013> They've already said they'll add more characters as dlc if the game does well, so basically expect to be able to play as anyone you can't already unlock in game as long as DMCV doesn't bomb
[1:56:53] <+天使42199> @Order_of_Mystery I mean I kinda hope he will be some kind of anti hero in this game, but who knows as long as he comes back
[1:56:56] <xeros720> i can't believe Pat came from behind and got that S rank guys, it was so sick
[1:56:57] <+imporia_> get closer
[1:56:58] <waifoong98> Punch line is just the Explosive Arrow in Dragon's Dogma, wow...
[1:56:59] <%joylent_blue> Order_of_Mystery idk i think some kind of redemption arc might be nice
[1:56:59] <Inebriateddonut> OVerture's hold is a grab
[1:57:00] <%terminallyCapriciousz> Vergil will never be playable in a baseline DMC game, he'll always be held back as SE purchase bait
[1:57:02] <%Kravedarknesss> @order_of_mystery I'm pretty sure Virgil is the one who takes Nero's arm so he's probably not good
[1:57:02] <%Trinity5> @BlitzChocula that's cursed
[1:57:02] <+PeaceCentennial> you have to hit him
[1:57:02] <tacostarvedbeast> give em a lil taste of the GOOD SHIT
[1:57:03] <+namillus> Lexgriv?
[1:57:04] <sunny_side_up> you have to hit them with the punch you goob
[1:57:05] <lilbreezy1155> i missed something, now hes fighting him on this building????
[1:57:07] <%lewdskeletor13> Vergil is cool the same way Dr Doom is cool. He’s still an asshole
[1:57:10] <Inebriateddonut> It's a grab
[1:57:16] <Fujiwara_92> GRAB PAT
[1:57:19] <artoflec> @tmix1600 Sasuke is the coolest lobosSmug
[1:57:20] <%aishman> You can use it to grab cars
[1:57:21] <+PeaceCentennial> do the aerial version against him
[1:57:22] <%TheFilth> STUMP TIME
[1:57:23] <%aishman> SO USE IT TO GRAB CARS
[1:57:26] <%jiin6> C for CRAZY
[1:57:28] <tank7013> It's a grab that plants a sticky bomb you can hit

[1:57:41] <majindusto> EASY MODE is now ENABLED!
[1:57:42] <+PeaceCentennial> Anyway the fact they made it so that DMC2 takes place before DMC4 is crazy
[1:57:47] <%CerberusDriver> The grabbing demon bringer esque arm isnt in this demo
[1:57:47] <+PeaceCentennial> how did Dante get out of hell
[1:57:50] <%Keyd00d> oooh that looks good
[1:57:52] <+imporia_> big S U C C

[1:58:18] <lloyddboy> BIG VORE
[1:58:18] <+Grayhammatter> a lot of S U C C
[1:58:23] <+PeaceCentennial> Just recently they said that DMC2 now CANONICALLY takes place before 4
[1:58:26] <Dvvolf> he does that attack to throw you out of there probably
[1:58:27] <ebonifragaria> The blood splatters on the UI glass, that's neat
[1:58:27] <%joylent_blue> lewdskeletor13 there was a new official timeline thing capcom did, says 4 is after 2
[1:58:28] <%lewdskeletor13> @peacecentennial Ya gotta source?
[1:58:29] <majindusto> GIVE ME LUCIA!
[1:58:29] <artoflec> Lucia ResidentSleeper

[1:58:32] <Jarvanii> daimon true form stuff going on with this boss
[1:58:33] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@derelictedangel) (warning)
[1:58:36] <%CerberusDriver> @PeaceCentennial or it was a mistake in the video
[1:58:36] <+PeaceCentennial> Yeah give me a second
[1:58:43] <%Keyd00d> SCUM
[1:58:44] <+Rust_Wick> da savior is coming!
[1:58:47] <%Ultradoom333> Lucia has a nice design
[1:58:56] <%bestwaifuritsu> the angel boss with the laserbeams looks a lot like Lucia's DT
[1:58:57] <%lewdskeletor13> Wait HOW is 4 after 2?
[1:59:00] <+Exyoh> The JPN Capcom youtube put out a video summary of the series' plot today. They put DMC2 footage before 4
[1:59:01] <+PeaceCentennial> It was during the stream
[1:59:04] <%joylent_blue> lewdskeletor13 lobosShrug
[1:59:05] <+PeaceCentennial> So when you think about it
[1:59:06] <+Incsony> is this on ps4 or pc?
[1:59:07] <+Grayhammatter> F
[1:59:10] <%BlitzChocula> had a shroom induced dream where DMC5 had a Viewtiful Joe secret post-game boss.
[1:59:12] <+JuiceBlox> I thought Pat was good at DMC
[1:59:14] <T_Sasquatch> im seeing moves ive never seen before
[1:59:16] <%Tokanova> how does he reload with one arm
[1:59:16] <majindusto> Lucia deserves to Return!

[1:59:18] <%TheFilth> boss design Kreygasm
[1:59:18] <T_Sasquatch> LUL
[1:59:20] <%bestwaifuritsu> 4 isnt after 2? 2 is after 4 and 5 takes place after dante comes back from hell?
[1:59:25] <tmix1600> Lucia is one of the ideas from DMC4 before DmC
[1:59:28] <Ropcord> OOF
[1:59:30] <%FrustratedAF> you'll never get S if you take damage from the boss
[1:59:31] <%Trinity5> @Tokanova he shoves the gun into his armpit
[1:59:32] <+Kataiser> BTW you can totally hit this boss in the balls and he has a reaction to it

[2:01:15] <AlasterAngelo> @namillus what plot elements
[2:01:15] <tmix1600> Shit, Arius was a better villain than mister pope

[2:01:20] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Lies
[2:01:21] <ghostravens> i don't believe you
[2:01:22] <+luketrapwalker> Pretty sure that's not it
[2:01:22] <%CerberusDriver> When
[2:01:23] <%BlitzChocula> so are we gonna get demon face building fights then
[2:01:23] <+Grayhammatter> 3
[2:01:24] <majindusto> ??? WHAT???
[2:01:24] <deathscythe122887> Bull Fudging Crap
[2:01:24] <%mercado94> It's true. they retconed in the stage play
[2:01:24] <+AncientToco> 3
[2:01:25] <Run44forrest> wasnt it always like that
[2:01:25] <TakesGuts> not confirmed
[2:01:27] <%Nobrev> when did that happen
[2:01:28] <+xxviios> 2 is still canon? lol
[2:01:28] <frozenottsel> 3
[2:01:29] <deadredeyez> I also heard this on the internet
[2:01:29] <+JuiceBlox> That sounds retarded
[2:01:29] <+namillus> @AlasterAngelo I mean, I couldn't tell you what Itsuno's thinking of.
[2:01:30] <%ECRead> ???? that sounds like big lies
[2:01:30] <+Renegaderade99> not true, they have the time lime up on capcoms japanese youtube channel
[2:01:31] <%TheSpiritof2277> That's bullshit, and I don't believe it
[2:01:32] <+PeaceCentennial> I can't link things in this chat so I can't provide my source
[2:01:33] <%TrafficCohen> @CerberusDriver Today
[2:01:36] <%joylent_blue> New official Capcom timeline video said so
[2:01:37] <%Plague_Nurse> that was a lie from reddit
[2:01:37] <%snow_bush> Welp, time to sleep and pretend to work tomorrow. Night all.
[2:01:38] <%oKentucky> Oooh this is hot
[2:01:39] <%lewdskeletor13> I’m just going off what chat said! Thought maybe Pat would know more
[2:01:40] <artoflec> honestly believing that any character from 2 is even a character elaK
[2:01:41] <thesw1tch> still dont understand why they never did anything with the end of DMC2. best part of that game
[2:01:41] <@StridentSong> The order is now 3 1 2 4
[2:01:41] <WaitHowDidIGetHere> @lewdskeletor13 You’d think that sort of thing would be set in stone from Day 1.
[2:01:42] <+namillus> But also, Capcom could've just goofed their editing.
[2:01:44] <%jiin6> Stage play is RL crazy talk at work
[2:01:44] <Downcom1ng> From what I've seen you can basically fly if you chain gerbera and air taunts
[2:01:46] <+wardenofwinter> Is this the same demo just got here?
[2:01:48] <%CerberusDriver> If you're talking about the History of DMC video, that was probably an editing mistake.
[2:01:49] <+Rust_Wick> fun fact, kyrie was supposed to be the villain in dmc4 but that idea was scrapped
[2:01:51] <+bonzosan> 31425
[2:01:51] <Dvvolf> even if dmc 2 is bad i want it to stay there as a reminder for capcom
[2:01:51] <%CerberusDriver> It is not confirmed.
[2:01:51] <+PeaceCentennial> It's a resetera thread that has a link to the time in stream
[2:01:52] <+MrFlyingMongoose123> So how does Pat like the gaem so far
[2:01:54] <+HotBloodedHero> 3 1 4 2 5
[2:01:54] <disflipmat> So what, 3 -> 1 -> 2 -> SMT3 -> 4 -> 5?
[2:01:56] <majindusto> DMC4 has always been before 2
[2:01:59] <weontheultralightbeam> SourPls
[2:02:01] <+Blargimazombie> -2 just doesn't fit in the timelines anwhere, just forget it
[2:02:01] <+PeaceCentennial> @StridentSong If I send you the source could you link it?
[2:02:02] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Who would go on the internet and lie?
[2:02:04] <+MrFlyingMongoose123> I take it by his silence he appreciates it
[2:02:10] <artoflec> where does Viewtiful Joe fit in to the timeline
[2:02:10] <mr_hunter> SourPls SourPls
[2:02:11] <+PeaceCentennial> It's resetera
[2:02:16] <Dvvolf> 4 is before 2
[2:02:18] <lloyddboy> B E G O N E
[2:02:18] <%awsomesaucekirby> cheer600 Hey pat, was watching some podcast clips, saw you talk about the fyre festival. I reccomend you watch the internet historian take on it. Apparently some of those "million dollar tickets" were sold for as little as $400 if I remember right. I know people ask you guys to play dnd, but you guys see too many problems with it, so here's an alternate idea: play a game on dndbeyond forums with some friends, then give the logs to your art friends to make a comic out of, then sell those. Profit.
[2:02:18] <BaronVonDickButt> BANG BANG BANG!
[2:02:19] <waifoong98> Shitsetera
[2:02:19] <%TheFilth> maybe it's because in the editing it would've been anti-climactic to put 10 seconds of DMC2 at the end
[2:02:20] <+bigb00gi3> hehe he clanky clap
[2:02:21] <pwnhills> Capcom also re-released the art book that still states 3-1-4-2
[2:02:23] <tmix1600> Kyrie is just princess peach to nero's mario
[2:02:27] <majindusto> Fuck Resetera!
[2:02:33] <+PeaceCentennial> Oh yeah resetera is garbage
[2:02:33] <disflipmat> SMT3 is after 2, we know that for sure
[2:02:34] <Foxbane44> is the dante demo available?
[2:02:36] <+JuiceBlox> OH MY GOD IT'S REAL 3>1>2>4>5 confirmed WTF
[2:02:37] <%mercado94> resetera LUL
[2:02:37] <+Rust_Wick> cept nero gets laid unlike mario
[2:02:38] <@StridentSong> @AngriestPat https://youtu.be/wMCqWNyfjhY This is the canon now
[2:02:40] <artoflec> princess peach is a better character than anyone in the reboot
[2:02:40] <+PeaceCentennial> but it's something
[2:02:45] <T_Sasquatch> @Foxbane44 nope
[2:02:46] <majindusto> I have that artbook
[2:02:46] <+xx123manxx> hentai mob
[2:02:47] <+PeaceCentennial> Ok nice Strident had source already
[2:02:49] <%jiin6> SMT3 was when Dante was heavily Addicted to Pizza sauce and thus a dream
[2:02:52] <gordieda20> Oh wow so 4 is after 2 then?
[2:02:55] <%BlitzChocula> yeah you parry that tentacle
[2:02:58] <%Hilleltaco> Didn't know you could do that
[2:03:06] <%joylent_blue> ohhh it has the mephisto needle effect
[2:03:08] <artoflec> is there gonna be a BIG tree boss in this game
[2:03:10] <+PeaceCentennial> So actually this makes a bit more sense
[2:03:14] <majindusto> No? 4 is before 2
[2:03:15] <%jiin6> parry the hentai away
[2:03:22] <+PeaceCentennial> because at the end of 2 it's heavily implied that Dante is already out of hell
[2:03:24] <Pookiedaexzile> did his dick fall off yet
[2:03:26] <disflipmat> Nuh uh, after 2 Dante goes "all the way into hell" and that's when he ends up in the Vortex world
[2:03:28] <%TheFilth> I really do think it was just an editing choice
[2:03:29] <+Bloodxb> nero says no to hentai
[2:03:31] <BigNerdSam> The final boss of DMC V is Xehanort
[2:03:31] <tmix1600> Only good characters in DMC was just in 3
[2:03:34] <BlacSoul> I always thought 4 was last since the motorcycle comes back at the end of 2
[2:03:43] <Ropcord> VIRGIL GOT NORTED D:
[2:03:47] <%CerberusDriver> It was probably an editing choice because DMC2 doesnt matter anyway
[2:03:49] <BaronVonDickButt> Wheres my Dante Dick Powers?
[2:03:49] <artoflec> did you know the same characters from 3 are in the other DMC games PogChamp
[2:03:49] <%lewdskeletor13> @angriestpat people are saying Capcom changed the timeline? I dunno
[2:03:52] <%mercado94> NORTED
[2:03:55] <%frisbe86> is that a stupid rocket fist?
[2:04:02] <Valentinius_Anodyne> The Japanese artbook still says the order is 31425
[2:04:02] <tmix1600> DmC has the best easily but its not saying much
[2:04:08] <sunny_side_up> its a stupid awesome rocket fist @frisbe86
[2:04:10] <Foxbane44> no charge shots?
[2:04:10] <Run44forrest> did they fix kyries weird face in this one
[2:04:13] <+PeaceCentennial> you fucking bet, frisbe
[2:04:14] <+MrFlyingMongoose123> Does Nero still only have the Red Queen?
[2:04:20] <%BlitzChocula> you think V is going to have a wacky Jester mode like Arkham?
[2:04:20] <artoflec> DmC's characters are some of the worst in this industry
[2:04:25] <MONSTR_UwU> LUL
[2:04:25] <+JollyHeracross> dmc
[2:04:27] <+JollyHeracross> 2
[2:04:27] <artoflec> down there with david cage
[2:04:28] <+PeaceCentennial> I don't think Kyrie is ever shown, Run44forest
[2:04:28] <Dral54> Nero did say "Guy just came back from hell" near the beginning when talking about dante in DMC4 right?
[2:04:30] <+JuiceBlox> DMC 2 judge unlocked
[2:04:33] <+PeaceCentennial> DmC's characters are fucking awful
[2:04:33] <majindusto> LUCIA MATTERS!
[2:04:34] <%Superstarsage> I have to hope the capcom stream messed the timeline because i can't comprehend how 2 is before 4
[2:04:35] <+JuiceBlox> juggle*
[2:04:39] <%CerberusDriver> Stop feeding the trolls, god damn
[2:04:41] <%Wrashis> strident just provided a sourse of 4 voming after 2 on a capcom stream
[2:04:43] <%joylent_blue> MrFlyingMongoose123 i mean, yeah, but his moveset is practically tripled with the robot arms
[2:04:44] <%Hilleltaco> @frisbe86 But what if I told you Nero can ride the rocket fist, what then?
[2:04:44] <Run44forrest> fuck you frisbee rocket punches are Sick
[2:04:45] <tmix1600> Besides Nero who was the best new character in 4
[2:04:46] <%Tallie> apatJpeg
[2:04:46] <+BorinCorran> What weird face? Kyrie is hot af.
[2:04:51] <%Wrashis> so i guess 4 is after 2
[2:04:58] <+PeaceCentennial> Kyrie is cute
[2:05:02] <%frisbe86> ride as in. in him?
[2:05:03] <%Rellim80> @angriestpat That feeling in your chest is a heart attack.
[2:05:03] <majindusto> 4 is before 2
[2:05:07] <+PrincessRapier> NOTICE ME
[2:05:07] <+PeaceCentennial> Nah
[2:05:08] <BaronVonDickButt> @AngriestPat LP with Woolie you coward!, just confirm it already
[2:05:08] <%Trinity5> honestly i feel like the stream just goofed
[2:05:08] <tmix1600> 4 is before 2
[2:05:10] <+PeaceCentennial> 4 is now after 2
[2:05:12] <%Hilleltaco> @frisbe86 Nah like a flying skateboard
[2:05:14] <+PeaceCentennial> changed today
[2:05:16] <+namillus> I don't think that video is conclusive
[2:05:18] <%Hilleltaco> Into demons
[2:05:18] <%ThePuddingDead> everytime im gonna do that screaming FBI OPEN UP
[2:05:18] <%lewdskeletor13> Is this 4 after 2 thing real or y’all just fucking with me apatPat
[2:05:19] <majindusto> I refuse any othe option
[2:05:19] <+JuiceBlox> 4 is NOW after 2
[2:05:22] <Dvvolf> by who and where
[2:05:25] <artoflec> when does the ANIME take place then artofl1Hmm
[2:05:28] <+PeaceCentennial> Stridentsong posted a source
[2:05:29] <Jaxnos> so either Capcom messed up the artbook or Capcom messed up the stream. what's more likely?
[2:05:30] <+JuiceBlox> Just google it
[2:05:31] <%Superstarsage> It's real, but it is from a capcom stream so y'know they might've just screwed it up
[2:05:33] <%BlitzChocula> now if only Capcom could do this kind of character action game, but with a Captain Commando reboot. That's free money, Capcom!
[2:05:34] <tmix1600> How is 4 after 2?
[2:05:36] <Kalcom> boo
[2:05:36] <+BorinCorran> @artoflec Right before 4.
[2:05:42] <AlasterAngelo> is Nero a Chad?
[2:05:42] <+PeaceCentennial> It's probably that they changed their minds about it
[2:05:43] <+Bloodxb> the order should be 3 1 4 2 5
[2:05:43] <sunny_side_up> the devs say it is so it is @tmix1600
[2:05:45] <artoflec> o right that makese sense
[2:05:47] <%Wrashis> its an official capcom stream, idk why it wouldnt be conclusive
[2:05:48] <SnaKemuho> they made 2 go before 4 in the video to have 4-5 because it's easier to follow, timeline is still 31425
[2:05:50] <%jiin6> STOP Saying 2 exists guys, your hurting pats feelings, hahaha jk go nuts
[2:05:57] <+PeaceCentennial> honestly there isn't much that gets fucked
[2:06:03] <tmix1600> The bike dante rides in DMCV is from 2
[2:06:05] <%joylent_blue> LUL
[2:06:06] <+PeaceCentennial> by saying 2 is before 4
[2:06:06] <%mercado94> yeah yeah sure but where does the stage play is in the timeline?
[2:06:07] <Dvvolf> seriously they need a dmc 2 remake to fix this
[2:06:07] <Ropcord> give 'em a little taste of the 👌👀👌👀 good shit go౦ԁ sHit👌 thats ✔ some good👌👌shit right👌👌there👌👌👌right✔there ✔✔
[2:06:07] <Jarvanii> someone's gonna mod it on pc so SSS makes the dancing gif popup all over the screen
[2:06:10] <+ill_sage> What demo is this
[2:06:11] <ThespianBarrage> Would you rate this game Ada or Claire?
[2:06:11] <+PeaceCentennial> no it's not, Tmix
[2:06:13] <randomness_yo> @AngriestPat Now do you understand why Woolie was in that first demo for so long? LOL
[2:06:13] <%TheFilth> I think it's best for a big cluster
[2:06:16] <Mr_Loboto> How many accounts has Pat gone through now?
[2:06:16] <majindusto> ANIME is CANON...Patty Lowell gets referenced in this Game!
[2:06:19] <+Hell_Raz0r> the damage is all on the last hit
[2:06:20] <+PeaceCentennial> it's a devil arms from DMCV
[2:06:20] <%MelBrooksKA> @JuiceBlox the only thing I got searching is DMCV is after 2
[2:06:22] <+xx123manxx> @Ropcord this is it chief
[2:06:25] <tmix1600> It is
[2:06:26] <AlasterAngelo> @ThespianBarrage Ada definitely
[2:06:26] <lloyddboy> crowd control pat
[2:06:27] <+PeaceCentennial> you don't start the game with that devil arm
[2:06:28] <+TopTieramisu> i haven't seen a demo this hype since PT...oh
[2:06:32] <%joylent_blue> its kinda weird yeah
[2:06:36] <Ropcord> НO0ОଠOOOOOОଠଠOoooᵒᵒᵒᵒᵒᵒᵒᵒᵒ👌 👌👌 👌 💯 👌 👀 👀 👀 👌👌Good shit
[2:06:39] <+BorinCorran> @majindusto And that still bewilders me a little.
[2:06:39] <+PeaceCentennial> that devil arm is from a boss we've already seen
[2:06:42] <%BlitzChocula> whoa, a DMC2 remake on the caliber/scale of an RE remake.
[2:06:42] <+OranHexthief> yeah it goes through enemies so it might be intended for just mass amounts done to large groups
[2:06:44] <aeonicvector> @Jarvanii all over? naj just in 3 big splotcjes like mari kart ink
[2:06:45] <%Divryne> @AngriestPat What attacks can you cancel?
[2:06:47] <+Cavumentum> Doesn't the artbook say it goes 3-1-4-2
[2:06:55] <%ShovelJustice21> oyveyDONG apatDab oyveyDONG
[2:06:56] <Broand> hey what serb does pat play on for ff14
[2:06:57] <%Trinity5> @Cavumentum ye. so one of them is wrong now
[2:07:00] <+Sxy_T_Rex> I want a DMC5 mod that lets me play as Mr. X
[2:07:01] <+Cavumentum> Because I trust that way more than "Capcom TV"
[2:07:02] <HaikuRaichu> From "DMC4 did not sell as much as MW2" to DMC5 exists. You gotta wonder why Capcom had a change of heart?
[2:07:03] <tmix1600> 2 original had plans for the cycle weapon but didnt work it in
[2:07:05] <T_Sasquatch> the game feels kinda loose but not in a bad way
[2:07:08] <%Solidus_113> @AngriestPat you can adjust the camera settings yourself in the options
[2:07:08] <uberhox> BEYOND EXPECTATIONS
[2:07:12] <+PeaceCentennial> oh you mean in that way, tmix
[2:07:12] <%Divryne> FUCK THAT'S GREAT.
[2:07:14] <%BlitzChocula> I agree with Nero
[2:07:17] <%ThePuddingDead> just runs past
[2:07:22] <%lewdskeletor13> Ok so I’m just gonna assume Capcom madd a mistake with that timeline until proven otherwise
[2:07:23] <+PeaceCentennial> yeah but that doesn't do anything for the canon
[2:07:24] <majindusto> Artbook is indeed 3 - 1 - 4 - 2
[2:07:26] <+mik255> isnt the same demo woolie played?
[2:07:29] <%TheFilth> fluid animations make this leagues better than 4
[2:07:29] <tmix1600> Thats why Dante always has a bike in 2
[2:07:30] <+namillus> @HaikuRaichu They released DMC4 Special Edition really close to DmC Definitive and DMC4SE blew out DmC
[2:07:31] <%aishman> @AngriestPat So, now that a new Titanfall..something is in the works now. Are you gonna try out the new hotness Apex Legend?
[2:07:32] <%Kravedarknesss> just gonna leave Nico on ring like that?
[2:07:32] <+xx123manxx> but can your new arm give demons the big suck like your old one?
[2:07:35] <%ShovelJustice21> apatBig oyveySNIFF
[2:07:35] <+PeaceCentennial> >CANERA DISTANCE
[2:07:37] <%joylent_blue> mik255 new arms and moves
[2:07:38] <+BorinCorran> @HaikuRaichu Inafune left the company and stopped pissing on everyones cheerios.
[2:07:38] <Broand> answer the phone
[2:07:43] <+mik255> ah ok
[2:07:43] <%joylent_blue> mik255 arm*
[2:07:53] <+PrincessRapier> sdogLove sdogLove
[2:07:59] <Jaxnos> I N S O L E N T
[2:08:06] <+BorinCorran> Mighty #9 aside of course.
[2:08:08] <HaikuRaichu> So Capcom doesn't have those expectations to sell as much as MW2 then.
[2:08:17] <tmix1600> The anime leads into 4 and its after 1
[2:08:17] <+PeaceCentennial> god this game looks so good
[2:08:20] <+PeaceCentennial> march can't come soon enough
[2:08:21] <%mister___doctor> I like how Nero was initially designed to be simple for Newcomers but now he has ALL THIS FUCKING SHIT
[2:08:25] <%BlitzChocula> this boss reminds me of the Spiral King's mech in Gurren Lagann.
[2:08:27] <%Jaxnos> mmmmmmm
[2:08:27] <+bigb00gi3> got here a few minutes ago, did we make a wisecrack about how this looks like the taurus demon fight
[2:08:39] <+PeaceCentennial> no bigb00gi3
[2:08:41] <+PeaceCentennial> that's all yours
[2:08:43] <HaikuRaichu> @mister___doctor You mean A TASTE OF THE GOOD SHIT!
[2:08:46] <+TopTieramisu> is this stray demon?
[2:08:47] <+bigb00gi3> aw, well it's not anymore
[2:08:50] <Foxbane44> tap B to defense
[2:08:52] <majindusto> Im still mad at Inafune for Legends 3 getting killed BibleThump
[2:08:52] <+bigb00gi3> BibleThump
[2:08:53] <T_Sasquatch> red orb gain seems alot better than every other game tho
[2:08:54] <Inebriateddonut> So Matt Walker says they have confirmed multiple times that 5 takes place after 2
[2:08:55] <tmix1600> 2 HAS to be after 4, it doesnt fit otherwise
[2:08:55] <%Jaxnos> apatSmug what a beautiful man and emote
[2:08:56] <artoflec> @mister___doctor i think compared to Dante, Nero will still be the "easier" character :P but i guess we'll see what V is about too
[2:09:02] <b_ikki> it's just a hit it's not a parry
[2:09:04] <%mercado94> The anime is from a timeline were link failed to save Hyrule
[2:09:04] <gordieda20> Pat says it's a better Beo Fight
[2:09:06] <b_ikki> same as sword
[2:09:12] <yoishbedoish> vineTommy good dodge pat
[2:09:13] <+PeaceCentennial> THE ANIME IS CANON
[2:09:15] <+PeaceCentennial> ACTUALLY CONFIRMED
[2:09:19] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@PeaceCentennial) (warning)
[2:09:20] <Ropcord> PogChamp
[2:09:20] <artoflec> there's still a crazy animation ive seen in this fight before that hasn't happened yet
[2:09:22] <randomness_yo> the dodging is so forgiving
[2:09:33] <tmix1600> Unless its the same bad writing from 4 and its novel
[2:09:35] <%BlitzChocula> they're trying to censor your truth @PeaceCentennial
[2:09:36] <b1gboss007> Penny is 18 in dmc5 Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm
[2:09:37] <+namillus> What about the new anime we're getting, how canon is that gonna be
[2:09:40] <+Grayhammatter> but is anime real pat?
[2:09:42] <sunny_side_up> pat when are you removing the moobot caps purge LUL
[2:09:43] <AlasterAngelo> depressed dante is canon
[2:09:43] <yorik1> is super best friends canon?
[2:09:44] <%Nobrev> alright I looked at the new dmc timeline video on capcom's channel and they really did alter their timeline for some reason. it's 3, 1, anime, 2, 4, 5 now
[2:09:45] <+天使42199> DAT GOOD SHIT
[2:09:46] <Hydrapissed> ewwwwwww is it
[2:09:47] <+Hell_Raz0r> can we get an HD, 3D Penny?
[2:09:48] <%TheFilth> I can't wait for Royal Guard to be more forgiving
[2:09:48] <Hydrapissed> yikes
[2:09:49] <Ropcord> НO0ОଠOOOOOОଠଠOoooᵒᵒᵒᵒᵒᵒᵒᵒᵒ👌 👌👌 👌 💯 👌 👀 👀 👀 👌👌Good shit
[2:09:50] <Inebriateddonut> But are they gonna explain why Morrison is suddenly black?
[2:09:51] <%Keyd00d> Does that mean I should WATCH it though?
[2:09:53] <b_ikki> strawberry icecream is canon
[2:09:54] <+PeaceCentennial> @BlitzChocula I'll spread the word of Penny some day
[2:09:54] <%TheSpiritof2277> Moobot hates the anime and Penny
[2:10:00] <artoflec> 4's writing is positively shakespearan, not like the angst vomit of that other thing
[2:10:01] <%Plague_Nurse> The anime is not worth watching
[2:10:02] <HaikuRaichu> @Inebriateddonut Shhhhh......
[2:10:02] <+paladinstarbuster> it alright
[2:10:04] <b1gboss007> @inebriateddonut he pulled an ariana grande
[2:10:07] <+PeaceCentennial> I like Penny as a character concept
[2:10:08] <%rumtumtugnutz> There's a Dante May Cry anime?
[2:10:10] <yoishbedoish> a demon calling someone else 'scum' is a weird line to me i dunno
[2:10:10] <b_ikki> yeah the anime is ass
[2:10:12] <+imporia_> Patty ?
[2:10:15] <Dvvolf> o wow so the dmc 2 before 4 is really a thing
[2:10:19] <gustavozxd> anime being canon means literally nothing
[2:10:19] <+PeaceCentennial> oh god it is Pattyu
[2:10:22] <VentusHero> but is the anime "canon" or "kh canon where nothing really happens"?
[2:10:23] <%lewdskeletor13> @angriestpat Capcom made a mistake on their timeline regarding 2 and 4 which is confusing people I guess
[2:10:24] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Well thats good because nothing happened in the anime
[2:10:24] <%TheMilhouseExperience> The anime is worse than 2
[2:10:25] <yorik1> Dante may appear for 5 minutes anime
[2:10:25] <%Nobrev> the anime is fun it's just not as good as it should have been
[2:10:26] <%mister___doctor> The intro to the DMC anime is the best part
[2:10:27] <+PeaceCentennial> Patty
[2:10:27] <artoflec> the anime must have been made on instant ramen budget because they never show any fights
[2:10:27] <fmbboaventura> The anime is just ok.
[2:10:27] <LowHighKang> @AngriestPat You can parry his tackle charge with a regular Overture attack
[2:10:27] <ebonifragaria> The anime is ok
[2:10:29] <%ThePuddingDead> i wonder in the full version, u could break his horns
[2:10:30] <%Jaxnos> look at this weird demon deviljho wannabe
[2:10:32] <gustavozxd> especially since one of the characters from the anime is now black
[2:10:33] <+BorinCorran> Fun fact, the anime was directed by the guy that made Berserk 2016.
[2:10:35] <+LiveStreamOnyx> @inebriateddonut he got Norted lorLOCKED
[2:10:37] <%ThePuddingDead> they look breakable
[2:10:39] <%BlitzChocula> I still cringe at DmC...like imagine the writers room - "Yeah, then Vergil takes a high caliber sniper rifle and executes the pregnant lady!"
[2:10:44] <T_Sasquatch> woof
[2:10:45] <+paladinstarbuster> The show is fine
[2:10:46] <+namillus> 5 seconds of one final boss clip does not really provide conclusive evidence of DMC2's place in the timeline.
[2:10:48] <+Grayhammatter> way too early
[2:10:59] <+Grayhammatter> F
[2:11:00] <metalliec> who do you think is stronger. Pat or Goliath

[2:12:27] <%TheSpiritof2277> KH3 stream YEYEYE
[2:12:29] <%lewdskeletor13> That timeline nonsense made my head spin for a sec LUL
[2:12:35] <%UltraCasualBoom> I still want Raditz as DLC
[2:12:37] <tmix1600> @Kakdela7 probably both
[2:12:37] <%awsomesaucekirby> HUNKULESE
[2:12:38] <ebonifragaria> Nico has such a great design
[2:12:39] <%Plague_Nurse> No KH3 stream
[2:12:40] <artoflec> @ramix_the_red Pat made a new zealand account or something, just gotta check the timezones
[2:12:43] <%voidthieff> we can skip kh3
[2:12:44] <majindusto> GIVE US KH3!!!
[2:12:49] <%BlitzChocula> Final Fantasy dlc for KH3 when
[2:12:50] <artoflec> @ramix_the_red otherwise it is out tomorrow for everyone else
[2:12:53] <+PeaceCentennial> I'm sure if we ask Matt Walker he'll give an answer
[2:12:57] <%FrostMass22> So the new demo is just the old one?
[2:13:00] <%mercado94> Final Fantasy in KH3 LUL
[2:13:00] <+LiveStreamOnyx> bardYell When’s Shaggy for FighterZ!

[2:13:07] <+BorinCorran> Pat will stream KH3 when Sora gets in Smash LUL
[2:13:16] <+PeaceCentennial> @Youwereeatenbyalid ha ha ;-;
[2:13:18] <%Plague_Nurse> that won't happen
[2:13:23] <%Prism_Wing> KH3 stream will just be 3 hours of chat corrections.
[2:13:25] <%BlitzChocula> @Youwereeatenbyalid that made me feel pain in my chest.
[2:13:34] <%FrostMass22> @borincorran Don't open that Pandora's Box.
[2:13:36] <%UltraCasualBoom> Everybody raffle when he comes back!!
[2:13:36] <ramix_the_red> @artoflec ah alright, thanks. I'm excited because I just beat dmc4 for the first time last night and now I can jump right into 5. kinda
[2:13:38] <%mercado94> @youwereeatenbyalid why are you like this?
[2:13:38] <artoflec> is That a SeCret Emblem
[2:13:45] <+Wool> So what's going on right now?
[2:13:47] <%voidthieff> @Youwereeatenbyalid Too real man
[2:13:52] <+badchoice5> KH3 is so incredible in some areas, but is straight up missing some staples I love (like FF characters)
[2:13:53] <krymzen5> 3 hours of acting like KHs plot isn't hot trash
[2:13:54] <%Hilleltaco> @FrostMass22 There's a fight that wasn't there before, you can buy Shuffle, and the Punchline arm is available
[2:13:56] <%MelBrooksKA> @Prism_Wing So nothing new?
[2:13:59] <%Plague_Nurse> everyone dab when he gets bacls
[2:14:02] <+Cavumentum> Matt Walker has already stated that DMCV takes place after 2 so that's that, now KH3 OR COWARD
[2:14:07] <%UltraCasualBoom> Dab and raffles
[2:14:07] <+天使42199> @Youwereeatenbyalid in the best timeline the friends would get back together
[2:14:07] <%rumtumtugnutz> Pat's gonna go touch a Dragon's Balls.
[2:14:08] <+BorinCorran> @FrostMass22 I know. I'm really playing with fire there.
[2:14:11] <+PeaceCentennial> yeah but if 4 is after 2
[2:14:16] <+PeaceCentennial> then so is 5
[2:14:21] <+PeaceCentennial> ;)
[2:14:21] <artoflec> yeah KH3's story makes me question why people were so mad at FFXV when THAT kind of garbage is what we could have ended up with
[2:14:21] <%voidthieff> @Plague_Nurse aye aye
[2:14:30] <+PeaceCentennial> well hold on
[2:14:35] <+PeaceCentennial> KH3 is an actually good game though
[2:14:36] <waifoong98> @TopTieramisu Fuck Frozen
[2:14:38] <+Bloodxb> why 5 be befre 2 he has the bike and he jsut got out of hell
[2:14:42] <+天使42199> so uh does kh3 SUCK or is it good
[2:14:43] <+PeaceCentennial> like FFXV has some gameplay problems
[2:14:43] <%mercado94> KH3 is fun
[2:14:44] <waifoong98> ah shit link the wrong people
[2:14:48] <krymzen5> KH3 is fun ye
[2:14:51] <tmix1600> 3,1,4,2,5
[2:14:52] <+PeaceCentennial> while KH3 is fucking solid as a game
[2:14:53] <%UltraCasualBoom> I can’t wait for Kingdom Hearts: The Story Ends in Total Confusion.
[2:14:54] <+PeaceCentennial> KH3 is good
[2:14:54] <%Plague_Nurse> KH3 is not a good game
[2:14:57] <Jaysky> The game, is fun.
[2:14:57] <%rumtumtugnutz> There are a million other people playing Kingdom Hearts 3. Let Pat play games he wants to.
[2:14:57] <AlasterAngelo> DMC5 demo is out in Japan if any of you want to try it right now
[2:15:00] <BlacSoul> It’s fun but just ok
[2:15:01] <%joylent_blue> KH3 plays really well
[2:15:01] <artoflec> KH3 is fantastic, its narrative stuff is just insane
[2:15:03] <%BlitzChocula> and so it begins.
[2:15:06] <Jaysky> KH3 is a good game though?
[2:15:07] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@IndoorSitup) (warning)
[2:15:11] <mario_Sif> its out in the UK too the dedmo
[2:15:12] <AlasterAngelo> i've heard KH3 plays like shit
[2:15:13] <mario_Sif> emo
[2:15:14] <mario_Sif> demo
[2:15:15] <+BorinCorran> I actually liked FFXV's story until it got literally railroaded. Would've liked all the DLC to come out...Too bad that ain't happening.
[2:15:18] <krymzen5> its a good game with a bad plot. bit easy even on proud tho
[2:15:20] <cayvalentine> Kingdom Hearts 3 is divisive.
[2:15:21] <%lewdskeletor13> They said KH3 is the end of the FIRST ACT. Like WTF
[2:15:26] <weissguard> And so chat goes to shit, because Pat forgot to clean up his applications. smh
[2:15:29] <%mercado94> @angel42199 it's fine. people overhype it a lot but turn out to be a really fun game
[2:15:33] <+PeaceCentennial> KH3 plays better than fucking anything to come out since 2
[2:15:35] <%Plague_Nurse> The gameplay is fun, but that's the only praise the game will get from me. From a narrative point, it SUCKS SO BAD
[2:15:37] <+PeaceCentennial> god fuck BBS
[2:15:37] <%rumtumtugnutz> Kingdom Hearts is a technically proficient game loaded down with weeb garbage that makes it difficult to take seriously
[2:15:38] <+Bloodxb> its the ned of the story weve knwon
[2:15:39] <+badchoice5> KH3 is even a great game
[2:15:39] <arkv01> man I really like the break music a lot more than P5
[2:15:40] <%BlitzChocula> the debate over KH3 was the REAL keyblade war the Master of Masters foretold.
[2:15:41] <artoflec> @BorinCorran well, they expanded that a lot mroe in Royal Edition and was frankly my favourite part of the game
[2:15:41] <Parapattern> The narrative stuff in KH3 is insane and fun laugh at
[2:15:45] <%joylent_blue> IndoorSitup you need to set up a new user on your ps4 and say they're in new zealand
[2:15:52] <IndoorSitup> Seriously how did Pat get the demo I need to know.
[2:15:55] <%voidthieff> KH never made any sense to me
[2:15:55] <AlasterAngelo> narratively only KH1 is good
[2:16:04] <AlasterAngelo> but people don't play KH for narrative
[2:16:06] <+mechslayer71> @indoorsitup New Zealand account
[2:16:06] <%UltraCasualBoom> KH3: Welcome to Storyline Die
[2:16:07] <+天使42199> @mercado94 huh okay. seriously ive only played KH1. im kinda tempted to play more cause kh2 is supposedly good, but then people are like the story sucks and whatnot
[2:16:09] <waifoong98> @IndoorSitup contact the Capcom people prob
[2:16:14] <%rumtumtugnutz> @IndoorSitup He created a New Zealand PSN account and downloaded it.

[2:16:23] <%Rhinoprotoss> Ready to watch Pat's ass get blown out?
[2:16:23] <artoflec> yeah you never take KH story SERIOUSLY, its just got VERY responsive fun combat and lots of fun polished stuff to do that fits the themes of the worlds you go to.
[2:16:23] <AlasterAngelo> no
[2:16:24] <%Mornaka> meh

[2:17:07] <+PeaceCentennial> it's sad that Vergil's voice actor can't participate in any of the pre-release fun even though he's in the game
[2:17:07] <+Promessa_EX> having ps+ in 2019 lol
[2:17:08] <%rumtumtugnutz> @chrisp1200 Yeah, but only the base game
[2:17:08] <+sleepwalk1221> Team Get Fuzzied
[2:17:09] <%Trinity5> wow that team sounds wacky as fuck lmao
[2:17:09] <artoflec> @BorinCorran i waited til that came out to play it the first time and just learning all the stuff that WASNT in there before, i can see how that game would just be kind of confusing and rushed. I mean, they added the city of insomnia as an actual area with sidequests and optional bosses and everything now.

[2:18:37] <%awsomesaucekirby> cheer600 pat: "I wanted them to add higher difficulty stuff to MHW." Also pat: "I hate lunastra because she's so hard." Jeez man. If you want to satisfy that grinding itch, might I reccomend Disgaea? It's the only game series I ever played to make mindless grinding really fun. Reccomend 5 because duh. Speaking of dbfz, I realized something. Yamcha and krillen are stronger than videl. Tell that to woolie. Also that long hair videl is better. Salt his wounds. Play long hair videl against him

[2:25:35] <Zereaux> is it stream sniping if you paint the target on your back?
[2:25:36] <%Aztec50> learn how do combo
[2:25:36] <%axellogic> You need to harness the power of the super saiyan baby
[2:25:36] <deviljhojho94> Just dont lose 4Head LOOOOOOOL
[2:25:37] <+NotGran> S U P E R D A S H

[2:25:40] <aeonicvector> your pressure isnt safe @AngriestPat
[2:25:41] <BadgerDK> all he has is counter
[2:25:41] <Jaysky> Pat please block attacks and grab when you can grab.
[2:25:42] <%Black_Machete> do the fighter line up like woolie
[2:25:42] <+AncientToco> Hold back to block
[2:25:42] <Ugato> They did a lot of combo
[2:25:43] <+Thorlias> barrScrem barrHyuck barrSqueent barrNOPE
[2:25:44] <%awsomesaucekirby> Use long hair videl
[2:25:44] <%Remery_> Ban Wool
[2:25:45] <Run44forrest> pat when you do the assist mid combo you should try jumping and doing combo instead of going straight for the grab
[2:25:45] <%BlitzChocula> the nervousness powers him up.
[2:25:47] <+VektorTroika> Just score more points than the other team!
[2:25:47] <Ugato> Pat didn’t do any combo
[2:25:49] <+Bloodxb> raise your number
[2:25:50] <+BorinCorran> Is it wrong I want canon 21 just so there's more fanart of her?
[2:25:52] <%Wrashis> my best advice is to stop touching your nose when you go for the command grav
[2:25:53] <+Cavumentum> Go Ultra Instinct, no thinking
[2:25:55] <KeiPrime> this great youtube channel called woolieversus has a primer on anime fighters
[2:25:55] <%goose_attack_almanac> Did Woolie just beat down PAt
[2:25:55] <+sleepwalk1221> I like it @AngriestPat
[2:25:56] <darmanitan555> never stop dashing
[2:25:56] <+jorgamund> @AngriestPat have you tried reducing the OTHER guy's HP to 0?
[2:25:57] <BigNerdSam> Play to win
[2:25:58] <Run44forrest> PICCOLO PogChamp
[2:25:58] <%HyperCharge_Sam> you need to learn big combo for max damage
[2:25:59] <%rad_rice> true gamers don't lab
[2:26:00] <%Trinity5> @BorinCorran no
[2:26:00] <%Appleauce101> wool was nervous when he beat woolie
[2:26:01] <SirBrawler18> You going team big boy?
[2:26:01] <haisho> quick someone show Pat the TED talk Pedro did in Woolie's stream
[2:26:02] <+PeaceCentennial> Canon 21 would be fun
[2:26:02] <krymzen5> mine are too pat. SF players are anti anime
[2:26:02] <CalderGaming> scrubquotesx
[2:26:06] <bigbradish> Pat is the anti Max
[2:26:07] <Run44forrest> pat you need to lab
[2:26:09] <+天使42199> @BorinCorran that is the correct reason to want her to be canon
[2:26:09] <%AncelDeLambert> labbing is for NERDS
[2:26:10] <%trez_> this IS the lab boys
[2:26:12] <KiraKamixephos> So you know what to do
[2:26:12] <lloyddboy> UH OH
[2:26:13] <Limes528> Be like Max and lab for 7 hours on stream
[2:26:15] <Jackedalot123> We all live to murder Pat
[2:26:17] <%Wrashis> @AngriestPat lab stands for lame ass bullshit amirite
[2:26:17] <austinj24> Always stretch Pat
[2:26:18] <Jon64s> Joe vs Steve who wins
[2:26:19] <+jazzcrasher> No LAB! NotLikeThis
[2:26:21] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> Any more AC7 Pat? There’s some wild bs later in that game
[2:26:21] <%BlitzChocula> @Limes528 I was just about to say that lmfao
[2:26:22] <BadgerDK> labbing is fun thoguh
[2:26:22] <%TheStarbecue> Protip: if you lost, it means you shouldn't have tried @AngriestPat

[2:26:28] <+VektorTroika> TRIPLE DUNK
[2:26:33] <+TopTieramisu> if they introduce canon 21, i'd prefer her without her majin form
[2:26:33] <%Trinity5> this game is on sale on steam btw
[2:26:34] <ghostravens> the ghost of fuggins is coming back to haunt you
[2:26:34] <Run44forrest> ok for someone who Never labbed pats doing ok

[2:26:43] <%Trinity5> all arcsys fighters are on sale i think
[2:26:45] <Jaysky> EVen if Android 21 isn't made canon at least we have a cute green alien chick whose canon
[2:26:45] <BigNerdSam> TRIPLE DUNKS RaccAttack RaccAttack RaccAttack ueah
[2:26:49] <%Trinity5> @luketrapwalker qanba obsidian

[2:26:54] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> Bakemono? Chigau. AKUMA DA.
[2:26:56] <+TopTieramisu> majin 21 is too rule34 buu for me
[2:26:59] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Cooler has an anime girl yell
[2:26:59] <%Trinity5> @AngriestPat OBSIDIAN YE
[2:26:59] <+NotGran> loop him
[2:26:59] <+PeaceCentennial> yep
[2:27:01] <AlasterAngelo> if Pat is the anti-Max and Max is only average what does that make Pat
[2:27:01] <%PanicSwytch> Where's fuggins?
[2:27:02] <+VektorTroika> the freaking voice crack Cooler makes when he does his fireball
[2:27:02] <JDRK> looks like an Obsidian yeah
[2:27:02] <+PeaceCentennial> obisdian
[2:27:05] <%bendatron> this is why pat when you queue up for ranked you go strait to the practice room and lab between matches
[2:27:06] <+luketrapwalker> cool thanks @Trinity5
[2:27:09] <aeonicvector> @AngriestPat biggest thing is practice your blockstrings and coolers pressure, your taking decisions that work online, but not against mixups as well
[2:27:10] <son_lefty> you're pressing buttons when you are unsafe
[2:27:12] <+PeaceCentennial> I have that arcade stick and it's amazing
[2:27:13] <+johnny_cue> THEN BROLY
[2:27:18] <%tinyswampthing> @AngriestPat your team is all big guys to they move a bit slower which is a big disadvantage in anime games also they get hit by more stuff easier
[2:27:18] <FruitBasketVidya> pat needs to quit reading chat mid match
[2:27:21] <SirBrawler18> I hear Videl is super fun.
[2:27:22] <+VektorTroika> Broly sendin fools to Burger King
[2:27:24] <%BlitzChocula> Pat has some pretty solid executions/string memorization for seldomly labbin'
[2:27:30] <waifoong98> READ US PAT Kappa
[2:27:36] <+Dovakhin573> also Dont forget you can swicth characters to heal bliue life
[2:27:39] <StarkMaximum> @tinyswampthing Yeah but they're so much bigger tho, which makes them superior to other, smaller, baby characters
[2:27:42] <aeonicvector> lmfao
[2:27:44] <+chrisp1200> HEY PAT READ ME!
[2:27:45] <%Trinity5> @aeonicvector oh hey i remember you from the sbfp dnd discord
[2:27:46] <KeiPrime> plz
[2:27:47] <+honorable_captain_garlock> they will eventually
[2:27:49] <arkv01> you thought you were gonna make lobby 4 your bitch but you actually came to the WRONG NEIGHBOURHOOD
[2:27:50] <AlasterAngelo> you're right pat
[2:27:50] <%ThePuddingDead> yeah might i suggest monhun dude
[2:27:51] <%Trinity5> @aeonicvector you got this game on PC?
[2:27:53] <+Sulfur_Boride> So what do people think of Broly's VA, Vic Mignogna, getting yeeted from Rooster Teeth and a role in a Funimation dub?
[2:27:53] <MisterArmory> USE SPARKING
[2:27:54] <+sleepwalk1221> @AngriestPat Broly's ki blasts are good for zoning
[2:27:56] <%trez_> broly going nuts in here
[2:27:57] <+badchoice5> Well, YOURS don't, clearly
[2:27:58] <leerocku> Nor do dead characters
[2:28:00] <%3xgilly> aDvIcE
[2:28:02] <yorik1> you time traveled to when DMC5 is playable, why don't you time travel to when you're good at DBZ?
[2:28:02] <BigNerdSam> @angriestpat You got too many heavies weighing you down. Switch to someone light and fast
[2:28:05] <aeonicvector> @Trinity5 not yet, but might this weekend
[2:28:06] <+TopTieramisu> i wonder how they'll change super broly to be different from boring broly
[2:28:06] <+BorinCorran> @tinyswampthing Pat needs to compensate tho.
[2:28:06] <AlasterAngelo> what is the likelihood of Pat winning a match tonight
[2:28:13] <arkv01> I love broly so much i want him to have my babies
[2:28:15] <%ECRead> @AngriestPat Cooler's assist guarantees Broly's 214SH super. Especially if Broly gets the unique air H that brings the enemy to the ground
[2:28:15] <%ThePuddingDead> eventually yeah but...
[2:28:16] <$Retrocop87> Try collecting the dragonballs and wishing for your opponent to shit their pants mid match?
[2:28:17] <%afronooch> @Sulfur_Boride huh?
[2:28:19] <%Trinity5> @aeonicvector sweet
[2:28:20] <+McSoliace> everyone is a killer
[2:28:21] <KiraKamixephos> Rip
[2:28:21] <haisho> KAKAROT
[2:28:22] <lionmanguy> Don't just sit there when they're hitting you, cause if they drop like that you miss any chance to get out
[2:28:25] <cayvalentine> MY BOY BEERUS has gotta come out someday
[2:28:25] <+paladinstarbuster> gotta mix it up
[2:28:26] <mr_slaide> Wow PAt, you're on a bigger losing streak than the Ottawa Senators.
[2:28:26] <AFoolishPaper> im open to advice but why would i do that
[2:28:27] <%rad_rice> play as krillin its your destiny
[2:28:28] <ShichiNoBushi> Because he's "Grapple Dad">
[2:28:29] <%commanderclaw> Team Composition matters
[2:28:31] <%Remery_> carrot :)
[2:28:31] <Jaysky> He's not here Broly
[2:28:31] <%ThePuddingDead> wat
[2:28:34] <alrobot2014> @yorik1 because that part of the timeline doesn't exist Kappa
[2:28:38] <exalt4747> @retrocop87 The podcast tells me that a guy who shit their pants can still win ONCE
[2:28:41] <+VektorTroika> Broly is almost as big and as strong as Paige
[2:28:43] <+a_deadbeat> So I was that Broly, you generally want to rely on your projectiles with him and move in after
[2:28:44] <StarkMaximum> Pat is a man after my own heart
[2:28:49] <%ECRead> @AngriestPat you gotta time it right though
[2:28:50] <StarkMaximum> He just picks the largest characters in the roster
[2:28:50] <+Sulfur_Boride> @afronooch Got yeeted cuz of sexual misconduct allegations
[2:28:50] <%Rhinoprotoss> So eat shit
[2:28:51] <%1buckboom> Holy shit elmo is being the cutest right now
[2:28:51] <aeonicvector> your fundamentals dont seem bad, just your a bit to agressive

[2:29:19] <+Bloodxb> NAPPA NAN8
[2:29:19] <horfenico> I bought this game and got bored so fast
[2:29:19] <+PeaceCentennial> NAPPA
[2:29:21] <+McSoliace> you can play anyone in this game as long as you put the time in
[2:29:21] <+a_deadbeat> With 16 you should probably use your mediums more than your heavies in neutral
[2:29:21] <CalderGaming> "open to suggestions"
[2:29:23] <a_mad_dragon> chat: "Spend less on candles!" Pat: "No."
[2:29:24] <+dijonaroni> Zangief >> Abigail
[2:29:24] <aeonicvector> your going in when they havent made a mistake, leading to who picked better
[2:29:25] <%afronooch> @Sulfur_Boride ahhh welp

[2:30:08] <%Trinity5> did this man just air 2H twice in the corner lmfao
[2:30:14] <aeonicvector> yeah, when you pick right, you WAIL on em, but your very momentum heavy as a player
[2:30:15] <ShichiNoBushi> When Takahata101 voice pack?

[2:31:16] <%ECRead> @AngriestPat A16's assist makes Broly's 236M safe on block
[2:31:18] <+Bloodxb> gohan is half a goku

[2:31:25] <+PeaceCentennial> get your characters out of the fight man
[2:31:35] <%Trinity5> @Sir_Gawain_Lotsson gotta get bodied to get better luygSmrt
[2:31:37] <DracaenaLeaf> When you kill Nappa but get beaten terribly
[2:31:40] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Pat playing DBFz like KOF
[2:31:40] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> Pat is like 12 times better than me and still gets his ass kicked
[2:31:45] <%Wrashis> it sure is nice of pat to give chat free wins
[2:31:46] <KiraKamixephos> Using 5H constantly in neutral is gonna get you big punished
[2:31:47] <+Pobega> will Pat ever tag to get red health back? Find out next week ...
[2:31:48] <+johnny_cue> New Broly better have that first person perspective combo
[2:31:50] <%Aztec50> he is just using weaponized 「Crazy Talk」guys cmon
[2:31:50] <%Superstarsage> Nice
[2:31:51] <fmbboaventura> He so dumb. But he's soo COOL
[2:31:52] <%tinyswampthing> man i havent seen teen gohan in a while this character got destroyed for no reason
[2:31:56] <%Keyd00d> begone come back
[2:32:03] <tmix1600> Pat doesnt tag when he needs too.Need to work on it
[2:32:05] <+BorinCorran> @Sir_Gawain_Lotsson I'm a huge coward so I don't either.
[2:32:06] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> @Trinity5 getting bodied does not make you better unless you can see what you did wrong
[2:32:07] <cayvalentine> Gotta get that Vegeta 2H in there.
[2:32:08] <%Trinity5> @tinyswampthing isn't teen gohan decent this latest patch?

[2:33:47] <horfenico> @borincorran sweet
[2:33:48] <Run44forrest> switch out. forward and tag
[2:33:55] <%ThePuddingDead> frieza is surprisingly fun to play
[2:34:05] <%vinlyxg> love to get a game in
[2:34:05] <%Trinity5> who's playing teen gohan
[2:34:06] <KeiPrime> freiza is cool
[2:34:07] <%Trinity5> Kaimart?
[2:34:07] <%Wrashis> oh is there no tag button? like a dedicated one?
[2:34:08] <StarkMaximum> good ol' freezer
[2:34:13] <%tinyswampthing> T gohan wasnt amzing to begin with ether
[2:34:14] <%Wrashis> is this a plague of gripes thing?
[2:34:14] <%Trinity5> @Wrashis there's two
[2:34:18] <%vinlyxg> but what up yall
[2:34:19] <+paladinstarbuster> 1.Dont let your team die 2.hit enemy 3.???? ***
[2:34:20] <+a_deadbeat> Much better with the 5Ms that round though
[2:34:23] <exalt4747> I'mma deck you in the schnoz!
[2:34:26] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Be better
[2:34:27] <horfenico> @borincorran better not be a separate character. 😂😂
[2:34:28] <+VektorTroika> tag in instead of super dashing
[2:34:28] <+honorable_captain_garlock> yeah you can tag before you die
[2:34:30] <StarkMaximum> You did, in fact, die. Sometimes that happens
[2:34:32] <Run44forrest> sucks that they fucked up golden frieza
[2:34:33] <StarkMaximum> This is unfortunate
[2:34:34] <%rad_rice> EL HERMANO
[2:34:40] <Naho_Saenoki> @exalt4747 That's... a new one.
[2:34:41] <+miguelrod777> THE BROTHER
[2:34:41] <+a_deadbeat> Even if you hit them in the air, it brings them to the ground, making hit confirms pretty easy
[2:34:46] <%Trinity5> oh yeah there's no point to play frieza now, huh
[2:34:47] <%AncelDeLambert> BROTHAAAAAAAAhh!
[2:34:49] <+BorinCorran> @horfenico Oh he totally is lol
[2:34:51] <%MightyMaxT> Pat's on PC, I'm assumign?
[2:34:56] <%Trinity5> @MightyMaxT nah
[2:34:58] <%Trinity5> ps4
[2:34:59] <cayvalentine> Gettin tagged by raw vanishes like a real champ
[2:35:08] <%AncelDeLambert> Any Freiza that is not Kuriboh is a fake Freiza
[2:35:09] <%Trinity5> @cayvalentine sometimes it be like that
[2:35:16] <StarkMaximum> that was a bit of a risky super dash ey?
[2:35:18] <cayvalentine> oh trust me i know
[2:35:23] <Nighthawkmun> Oh god a fight game, huh?
[2:35:23] <aeonicvector> @AncelDeLambert truest words
[2:35:24] <AlasterAngelo> why does Pat play such big characters when he is so small
[2:35:26] <+VektorTroika> looks like it's Frieza's turn on the xbox
[2:35:28] <%Trinity5> i can't fucking believe Kazunoko won 4 fucking dragonballs and the tour
[2:35:30] <+Pobega> i wish health wasnt normalized in this game
[2:35:33] <Run44forrest> too bad this frieza kinda sucks
[2:35:37] <+VektorTroika> go GOOOOOLD
[2:35:38] <%Trinity5> yamcha assist forever
[2:35:39] <Run44forrest> ooooooooooooooo
[2:35:40] <StarkMaximum> Does DBFZ have crossplay so PC players can play against Pat or do you need the PS4 game
[2:35:41] <%Trinity5> even when it sucks
[2:35:41] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> I was almos an '09er, but I got bodied so hard by everyone ever that it turned me off to playing fighting games online in any capacity
[2:35:45] <exalt4747> Good ol' Iron Frieza
[2:35:45] <Limes528> He's lovin' it
[2:35:46] <%Trinity5> @StarkMaximum no crossplay
[2:35:46] <NicholasKane> @AlasterAngelo same reason i play characters who are cool and look good
[2:35:46] <+TheHeroAppears> LUL
[2:35:46] <+honorable_captain_garlock> wut a waste
[2:35:50] <+TopTieramisu> @Trinity5 not too surprising. kazunoko is really good
[2:35:52] <StarkMaximum> @Trinity5 owned
[2:35:52] <Run44forrest> NotLikeThis
[2:35:53] <Geno4344> did they replace Broly's VA yet Kappa
[2:35:55] <+Mikatonic> is the server discord only?
[2:35:57] <+TopTieramisu> he's pretty much the best dbfz player atm
[2:35:57] <%vinlyxg> reminds me of the roly movie
[2:35:59] <%yeknomlive> let's go justin!
[2:36:01] <ArtThouBored> Better than Old Dub Frieza
[2:36:07] <%tinyswampthing> The fact that golden Frieza got destoryed indirectly by system changes is very upseting
[2:36:07] <exalt4747> But that's do dumb! But he's so cool!
[2:36:10] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> I can get into For Honor, but even that mostly just against AI. I rarely go against real people
[2:36:12] <Tonytehgreat> when does the demo come out?
[2:36:13] <yorik1> pat time traveled to play DMC5, why doesn't he time travel to when he's good at DBZ?
[2:36:13] <%trez_> vegeta too short to grab
[2:36:15] <Geno4344> wasn't old dub Frieza literally Sabat's mom
[2:36:19] <%ECRead> @AngriestPat yes oki is wakeup. especially hard knockdown in this case. I throw them out after lvl3s a lot.
[2:36:20] <%ThePuddingDead> yep...
[2:36:20] <%Trinity5> @TopTieramisu yeah it's not surprising I just find it great we needed to have 4 LCQs just for it to not matter LUL
[2:36:22] <Quikanims> so is push blocking in the game now?
[2:36:27] <+BorinCorran> @Geno4344 It wouldn't be hard. I'll do it for $20 my demo reel could use some high profile work.
[2:36:30] <ArtThouBored> Where everyone thought Freeza was a girl
[2:36:35] <KiraKamixephos> pat you gotta use your meter
[2:36:36] <%SpamKingRathalos> jesus
[2:36:37] <%laserbeaming> It's rough to play Broly with no assist
[2:36:38] <+TopTieramisu> @Trinity5 hey one of the LCQ winners got to grand finals
[2:36:48] <%ThePuddingDead> throw it on the GROUND
[2:36:49] <%Trinity5> @TopTieramisu truuuuue
[2:36:50] <+VektorTroika> "On a scale of 1 to 10, how arcsys is this fighting game banter?"
[2:36:51] <%Wrashis> when you said the guy won 4 dragonballs for a second my brain thought you meant the same guy went to different tourneys and won every gemstone in the battle for the stones
[2:36:55] <Fujiwara_92> RAW TIME
[2:36:57] <%tinyswampthing> never change shitty beerus orbs
[2:36:58] <%ThePuddingDead> no way
[2:37:00] <+TopTieramisu> i was rooting for go1
[2:37:01] <+miguelrod777> WHAT
[2:37:01] <%Trinity5> @TopTieramisu fenritti is a god
[2:37:06] <+Bloodxb> DOO ET
[2:37:06] <%Rhinoprotoss> This guy is throwing the game
[2:37:07] <+honorable_captain_garlock> oh god no pat please dont win you dont deserve it
[2:37:08] <+TopTieramisu> but good shit from all
[2:37:09] <aeonicvector> @AngriestPat you seem alot better with broly then cooler
[2:37:10] <%rad_rice> pat just spam autocombos true gamers get the dragon balls
[2:37:10] <+Wool> @tinyswampthing Beerus' orbs are actually pretty solid now
[2:37:10] <%ThePuddingDead> dammit
[2:37:11] <buffmurffy> you can tag out of a block for one meter, that gives you an opportunity to get someone else in
[2:37:14] <%yeknomlive> good effort
[2:37:14] <IminyourBase> you tried tho
[2:37:16] <cuteboySNOWY> really good comeback though
[2:37:16] <+Wool> so Pat has the bigger combos and damage while Woolie has the better neutral in DBFZ
[2:37:16] <Jaysky> Broly almost solo'd
[2:37:17] <%LixFury> Fuuuck
[2:37:17] <AlasterAngelo> tap
[2:37:20] <%blackace186> the whiff exchange
[2:37:20] <AnimeJedi25> soooo close
[2:37:22] <+Dovakhin573> ggs
[2:37:24] <IBeastmanNinjaI1> Damn, close
[2:37:28] <%ElenaManetta> With how much you dumped on Broly as a character, it's funny you main him
[2:37:29] <cayvalentine> i would say on a scale of one to ten this game is like 7 arcsys, not quite 10 asrcys blazblue
[2:37:29] <+a_deadbeat> After 2H with Broly, if you do jump heavy, he'll chokeslam them to the ground. You can do light air command grab after that and then vanish, letting you extend the combo low to the ground
[2:37:31] <%ElenaManetta> on the podcast
[2:37:32] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> Vegeta wtf
[2:37:34] <%Keyd00d> vegeta showing shame in front of freeza
[2:37:35] <%Trinity5> i forget is guard cancel good now
[2:37:37] <%Rhinoprotoss> BUT WHAT IF I NEED IT
[2:37:37] <KeiPrime> gotta spend meter sometimes
[2:37:37] <darthkickass> how much longer till the demo drops?
[2:37:42] <BadgerDK> meter is gaing fast in this game
[2:37:43] <gottigotbundles> its punishable if blocked
[2:37:44] <Xirn> meter's pretty easy to build
[2:37:44] <%voidthieff> will pat ever stream xcom again?
[2:37:46] <Tonytehgreat> whens that demo come out patty?
[2:37:47] <+VektorTroika> Vegeta is super scared of Beerus because he respects hierarchy
[2:37:48] <%afronooch> it do be like that pat
[2:37:49] <BadgerDK> you have so much meter wtf
[2:37:51] <JDRK> how's Pat gonna raw level 3 if he spends his meter?
[2:37:53] <KiraKamixephos> pat you had max meter and didn’t do anything with it
[2:37:54] <%TheNommad> Yay my weird dwarf father is on
[2:37:55] <StarkMaximum> "yeah but that takes meter which means less level 3s!!"
[2:37:56] <%ironshah> any for honor tonight?
[2:38:02] <%tinyswampthing> @Wool yeah but the super dashing still destroys it
[2:38:02] <%Trinity5> @Tonytehgreat out in new zealand, if you were waiting for it on stream you missed it
[2:38:04] <%ElenaManetta> 1281 matches
[2:38:06] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Happy Crimus
[2:38:07] <+a_deadbeat> If we play again I'll try to demonstrate it
[2:38:09] <AnimeJedi25> you can just tag with the d-pad on a controller
[2:38:12] <+QuadraticGravity> "But that takes a meter"This isn't a JRPG, you don't get to save your ethers :P
[2:38:17] <%Gatzarlok> 1281 matches, jesus fuck...
[2:38:18] <antthefool> U
[2:38:18] <%rad_rice> tien mains rise up
[2:38:24] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> Demos out isn’t it? I’m playing it now
[2:38:25] <%Trinity5> @rad_rice yo
[2:38:25] <+a_deadbeat> The jump heavy is after you superdash after them
[2:38:25] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> @VektorTroika nah Vegeta is scared of Beerus because Beerus hangs out with Bulma and Bulla all the time
[2:38:30] <%Trinity5> OH FUCK
[2:38:32] <%Trinity5> VEGITO BLUE

[2:38:52] <alrobot2014> wo
[2:38:56] <%tinyswampthing> this character takes learning
[2:38:57] <+PeaceCentennial> JUST LOOK AT MY SPEED
[2:38:57] <cedryk98> this guy is just going to shit on him then leave im assuming
[2:38:58] <+Pobega> woof
[2:39:00] <haisho> look at his speed guys
[2:39:00] <KiraKamixephos> vegito is a big scrub killer
[2:39:03] <%SpamKingRathalos> f u n

[2:39:04] <+honorable_captain_garlock> block that next time pat
[2:39:04] <+VektorTroika> @Sir_Gawain_Lotsson ah yes, the only human being in the universe that Vegeta truly fears
[2:39:05] <%trez_> monkaS
[2:39:05] <StarkMaximum> just look at my speed!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[2:39:05] <%ElenaManetta> Pat is deer in the headlights
[2:39:05] <%tinyswampthing> to fight\
[2:39:07] <%Trinity5> this is now a single player game
[2:39:09] <%Big_Dream> he is so fast
[2:39:09] <%blackace186> dammit pat block
[2:39:11] <+BorinCorran> Speed? Vegito is Sanic confirmed!
[2:39:12] <%ThePuddingDead> might as well put the controller down
[2:39:13] <%Trinity5> OH SHIT
[2:39:13] <deviljhojho94> monkaS !
[2:39:14] <Fujiwara_92> HOLY FUCK
[2:39:15] <%TheStarbecue> vegito is sonic
[2:39:17] <+miguelrod777> that's a strong opener
[2:39:25] <%Gatzarlok> Pat got a hit in, good job!
[2:39:35] <BadgerDK> it's not your turn
[2:39:37] <fmc009> Is it possible for me to join on the looby or is Pat just doing ranked?
[2:39:37] <%Trinity5> i still get mixed by vegito's basic strings lmao
[2:39:38] <+PeaceCentennial> he's formulaic
[2:39:39] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> @VektorTroika yeah that and the initial fear that Beerus would destroy the Earth, those two included
[2:39:40] <%MightyMaxT> Is he quite confident in his speed though?
[2:39:45] <cedryk98> this guy isnt even a good vegito though
[2:39:47] <+PeaceCentennial> it's 3 normals and then attempt at overhead
[2:39:49] <%Niney_Who> GO BROLY
[2:39:51] <+TopTieramisu> anyone notice goku's hair transformations in super were red, white, and blue? murrica
[2:39:53] <DefaultSettiings> I came here to judge Pat for using boss characters, but I'm satisfied with watching this beating instead
[2:39:53] <+PeaceCentennial> you can reflect
[2:39:54] <cayvalentine> This vegito is doing okay but they dropped a lot of shit they shouldn't
[2:39:56] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> whoa, cool Cooler color
[2:39:58] <+QuadraticGravity> You can't combo into broly ground grabs
[2:39:59] <fmbboaventura> This guy is good
[2:40:10] <Hellarussian> VERY cool
[2:40:11] <KaptainKappathe5th> "now this is a worthy challenge" gee you dont say cooler
[2:40:11] <%ThePuddingDead> thats it
[2:40:14] <+johnny_volcano> HAHAHHAHS
[2:40:15] <%Trinity5> Pat's treating this like an arcade, labbing mid match lmao
[2:40:18] <+honorable_captain_garlock> very cool kanye

[2:43:30] <+VektorTroika> this guy cleaned up on woolie's stream too
[2:43:33] <ManOfReason> "Certified Bussass!"
[2:43:34] <Twoiis> Every Broly block string he does ends in a 'tick' grab.

[2:44:17] <%ThePuddingDead> this is not a good night
[2:44:17] <Run44forrest> especially now that you cant hellzone 2s 2s 6S 5H into lvl 3
[2:44:17] <+a_deadbeat> Cooler's 236M is a true reversal Pat
[2:44:18] <%ElenaManetta> Pat should DBFZ for charity. 24 hours straight
[2:44:20] <+TopTieramisu> gohan is the sean of dbz. designed to take the mantle but was relegated to a joke because the creators got cold feet

[2:44:41] <%Trinity5> sometimes you just gotta wakeup level 2 sparking man
[2:44:44] <%UltraCasualBoom> Big meaties
[2:44:46] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> WTF are meaties
[2:44:47] <KeiPrime> you need a reversal move or yeah reflect
[2:44:48] <VentusHero> @TopTieramisu sean from what, if i may ask?
[2:44:50] <+PeaceCentennial> just reflect more
[2:44:52] <+TopTieramisu> sf3
[2:44:53] <BadgerDK> it's not your turn on wakeup pretty much ever
[2:44:53] <aeonicvector> solid, but since you cant outpace your defensive turnaround game needs to be on point
[2:44:54] <%ECRead> meaties are extremely strong.
[2:44:55] <+天使42199> sean is from street fighter
[2:44:58] <+天使42199> 3
[2:44:58] <+QuadraticGravity> You cannot hit buttons out of wakeup unless you're going to raw lv3
[2:45:01] <%TheStarbecue> Remember to guard cancel, dad
[2:45:01] <+GlewmanIII> no
[2:45:02] <fmc009> @AngriestPat Where is the lobby at to join
[2:45:02] <+PeaceCentennial> no
[2:45:03] <%Trinity5> @Sir_Gawain_Lotsson moves timed to hit them on wakeup
[2:45:12] <+TopTieramisu> sean was supposed to be the only shoto in sf3 originally
[2:45:17] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @VentusHero Street Fighter 3
[2:45:18] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> @Trinity5 I fuckin hate meaties in fighting games
[2:45:18] <Run44forrest> does pat even have a low 2L
[2:45:25] <%Pakooboomi> is pat playing on the ps4 or pc?
[2:45:27] <VentusHero> oh poor sean
[2:45:27] <KiraKamixephos> Only with 16
[2:45:28] <%ECRead> reflect doesn't have startup anymore. it used to.
[2:45:29] <+PeaceCentennial> PS4
[2:45:30] <KeiPrime> ps4
[2:45:31] <%Trinity5> @Sir_Gawain_Lotsson yeah they get me too
[2:45:33] <+BorinCorran> Gohan would be better if he wasn't wearing Goku's gi. I'll only accept him in Piccolo Purple or his Saiyaman suit.
[2:45:38] <%Trinity5> @Sir_Gawain_Lotsson just gotta block on wakeup
[2:45:41] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> And Alex was supposed to be the poster boy, not Sean.
[2:45:46] <fmc009> No I mean literally what lobby is Pat at xD
[2:45:47] <NotoriousColossus> neat
[2:45:48] <mordeesuno> LMAO
[2:45:51] <mr_slaide> ...
[2:45:54] <%Pakooboomi> @PeaceCentennial @KeiPrime thanks
[2:45:54] <+badchoice5> Wow Pat's Broly got REALLY good
[2:46:00] <StarkMaximum> I always forget about reflects, are they just a go-to defensive move that stops most aggression or do you need to find the right spot
[2:46:03] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> @Trinity5 see I never got good at blocking in games where you have to hold Back to block
[2:46:06] <%iwishthiswasicq> @fmc009 Canada East Coast, 4th lobby
[2:46:09] <%ECRead> @fmc009 Canada East 4
[2:46:14] <%Trinity5> @Sir_Gawain_Lotsson so you're an mk/soul calibur kinda guy then?
[2:46:14] <alrobot2014> canada, east coast #4 password 1115
[2:46:15] <fmc009> Thanks guys
[2:46:18] <+GlewmanIII> LMAO
[2:46:18] <+TopTieramisu> @Sphincter_Spelunker he did play that role in sf3. also, he wasn't viewed as a joke in that game at least
[2:46:18] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> @Trinity5 just super fucking counter intuitive for me
[2:46:20] <%blackace186> DODGE
[2:46:24] <%HyperCharge_Sam> Pat just needs to have some more optimized combos
[2:46:29] <AlasterAngelo> this is what happens when you don't lab Pat
[2:46:29] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> @Trinity5 nah I never played those
[2:46:30] <+cahv123> Broly going ham.
[2:46:31] <%Rhinoprotoss> Damn
[2:46:31] <NicholasKane> Canada East Meeting 04, 1115. be sure to line up
[2:46:38] <mordeesuno> good night sweet prince
[2:46:38] <+GlewmanIII> broly the worlds strongest
[2:46:39] <%Rhinoprotoss> Learn to block fool
[2:46:39] <%tinyswampthing> Wow an actual optimized broly combo
[2:46:42] <KeiPrime> for me 2d fighters make more sense to hold back and 3d fighters make more sense to have a block button
[2:46:43] <%Trinity5> @Sir_Gawain_Lotsson lol i'm young what other fighting games have button blocks
[2:46:55] <+badchoice5> That's Broly's infinite Pat, if you don't block or counter it he can just keep hitting you
[2:46:59] <+TopTieramisu> tekken's fine without a block button
[2:47:04] <%Trinity5> @TopTieramisu i agree
[2:47:06] <+TopTieramisu> especially since it has neutral block
[2:47:08] <%3xgilly> oooooooooo
[2:47:10] <+GlewmanIII> you need to block in tekken sometimes
[2:47:10] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> @Trinity5 my FG experiences are: SF4/SSF4, Injustice 1, Budokai, DBFZ
[2:47:12] <%Nobrev> Ok pat I got the foolproof strategy. you gotta not lose anymore. (I'm sorry I don't have enough experience in this game to give legit advice)
[2:47:14] <%3xgilly> thats super interesting
[2:47:15] <mr_slaide> ...
[2:47:15] <%Niney_Who> This is proof that All Short People are Bottoms.
[2:47:19] <+a_deadbeat> I'm sorry I had to do that do you
[2:47:20] <%Quigsies> clempsF clempsF clempsF
[2:47:22] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> @AngriestPat Your front door is open.
[2:47:22] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> @Trinity5 and For Honor
[2:47:22] <KeiPrime> i got used to tekken but i feel like i need a button on 3d
[2:47:28] <%Trinity5> @Sir_Gawain_Lotsson so budokai's the only one with a block button ye? and for honor?
[2:47:33] <AlasterAngelo> BLAME YOUR OWN FATE
[2:47:34] <+a_deadbeat> but hopefully I showed what Broly can do
[2:47:37] <+GlewmanIII> @TopTieramisu there's a hanful of strings that neutral block doesn't work on
[2:47:41] <Naho_Saenoki> @Trinity5 Mortal Kombat
[2:47:41] <+McSoliace> the people saying just block are crazy
[2:47:42] <%ECRead> oh some of these killers were in Woolie's stream last night
[2:47:42] <mr_slaide> Pat = Gillberg. WHO'S NEXT?
[2:47:43] <StarkMaximum> Pat are you upset
[2:47:44] <Run44forrest> Elmho
[2:47:45] <%Trinity5> @Sir_Gawain_Lotsson just gotta hold down + back for like 95% of the time
[2:47:45] <+a_deadbeat> sorry man
[2:47:46] <septimberwolf> Piccolo is a monster
[2:47:46] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Piccolo wanted to help in the new Broly movie. But knew he couldn't FeelsBadMan
[2:47:56] <%Trinity5> @Naho_Saenoki yeah i know but i'm asking about this guy specificially
[2:47:56] <+VektorTroika> learn BETTER
[2:47:57] <+Shastafield> LUL
[2:47:58] <%Rhinoprotoss> Wonder why people don't like fighting games....
[2:47:59] <tmix1600> Tag out more
[2:47:59] <Kaneis> Especially with two compatible assists, Broly can be a total fucktrain
[2:47:59] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> @Trinity5 I don't even remember if budokai had blocking lol. For honor has the 3-directional block/parry system
[2:48:00] <DefaultSettiings> time for waifu OhMyDog
[2:48:02] <+TopTieramisu> @GlewmanIII yeah. which is why you shouldn't neutral block through strings. but it helps in neutral
[2:48:05] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> welcome to fighting games
[2:48:06] <+a_deadbeat> If you want, hit me up about Broly later, I'd be happy to explain stuff
[2:48:07] <LibriJamm> Don't ArcSys games kinda punish you for blocking in the first place?
[2:48:07] <mr_slaide> Waifu 21
[2:48:11] <+Bloodxb> vegeta best gorl
[2:48:13] <buffmurffy> if you have ANY blue health, DHC
[2:48:13] <+johnny_volcano> @angriestpat call assists to start safe pressure
[2:48:13] <+honorable_captain_garlock> ya gotta read that mixup
[2:48:15] <Run44forrest> hold that fuzzy
[2:48:17] <+badchoice5> You learned something about inevitability
[2:48:19] <%HyperCharge_Sam> LUL
[2:48:21] <%PanicSwytch> Can't escape from crossing fate
[2:48:22] <%Trinity5> @LibriJamm yeah they do lmao
[2:48:24] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> I FEEL THAT PAT
[2:48:24] <+a_deadbeat> now I feel bad :(
[2:48:25] <Ion_LaserX> I see Vore Waifu is in this match
[2:48:30] <Twoiis> He def mixed and did a few d rushes.
[2:48:32] <%Trinity5> man the fucking RISC gauge in guilty gear
[2:48:34] <gottigotbundles> buss ass is my main account
[2:48:35] <AlasterAngelo> don't feel bad Pat deserved that
[2:48:37] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> waifu
[2:48:38] <+bigb00gi3> aw, don't give the guy sass, he wasn't being mean
[2:48:43] <+Promessa_EX> don't, pat is wrong
[2:48:49] <%Trinity5> play to win
[2:48:49] <Jackedalot123> I’m next. Hope I don’t make a fool of myself
[2:48:50] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> "Hopefully getting absolutely smashed here helped you get better" But I have NO CLUE what you were DOING to me
[2:48:52] <exalt4747> PAT SWITCHED
[2:48:52] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat's getting beaten by a GURL hurr hurr hurr
[2:48:53] <emeraldskrull> how embarrassing
[2:48:54] <%Nobrev> I love 21's voice
[2:48:54] <CptBritches> Pat, he was being nice
[2:48:58] <cedryk98> the learning path is mostly this: Learn to do BNB, learn to block a string, learn neutral, learn how to incorporate assists into combos
[2:48:59] <StarkMaximum> @a_deadbeat Don't, it's just difficult to learn while getting your head kicked in, and one game won't teach you much
[2:49:00] <+TopTieramisu> as for a game that uses a block button, there's SC6
[2:49:01] <+cahv123> Pat its not a good idea to just press buttons. Especially against someone who knows what theyre doing.
[2:49:05] <NicholasKane> i wanna get beaten by a girl
[2:49:06] <%Niney_Who> Android 21 is just Paige
[2:49:07] <%Rhinoprotoss> Stop doing level 1s
[2:49:10] <fmc009> I'm on the line for the lobby
[2:49:17] <fmc009> quest to wait confirmed
[2:49:27] <%blackace186> You can't just sit there and press nothing man. Mash a button and hope they fudge up their combo.
[2:49:37] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> "Any girl" "This is literally Paige" coxDerp
[2:49:38] <+GlewmanIII> use meter for dhc kills
[2:49:39] <Fujiwara_92> 3
[2:49:43] <KeiPrime> tag in broly man
[2:49:45] <+wanggeniee> PC?
[2:49:45] <+honorable_captain_garlock> yeah if you arent gonna kill and you dont have 7 bars save it
[2:49:46] <AlasterAngelo> Vegeta is literally Paige
[2:49:46] <Run44forrest> you can keep the combo going pat
[2:49:47] <%Trinity5> i mean if you can't kill it's just wasting meter most of the time, yeah?
[2:49:47] <+Shastafield> hmmst
[2:49:50] <+QuadraticGravity> Twitch chat is sure suddenly experts at fighterz huh
[2:49:53] <Kaneis> Spending meter after every combo isn't the best thing every time
[2:49:53] <tmix1600> Switch out if you have a lot of blue health
[2:49:55] <KeiPrime> bleedin so hard right now
[2:49:55] <person181> that palit for veggi looks good
[2:49:56] <+TopTieramisu> android 21 never turns anyone into mustard
[2:49:58] <cedryk98> only level one to confirm kills, level 3s are for setting up a mixup
[2:49:58] <%Niney_Who> @Sphincter_Spelunker >Girl that can turn people into food she can eat.
[2:49:58] <KiraKamixephos> Should only do level one if it’s gonna kill or switch out
[2:50:01] <%afronooch> @QuadraticGravity hahah yup
[2:50:01] <tmix1600> Like now
[2:50:23] <fmc009> Up teching is a plague
[2:50:24] <%Rhinoprotoss> It's better to pressure instead of level 1
[2:50:24] <+VektorTroika> shoulda swapped cooler after a launch
[2:50:29] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> Level 1 supers don't do much more damage than free specials
[2:50:30] <Kaneis> Use the knockdown to mix up for another combo
[2:50:32] <gottigotbundles> no use the meter for level for hard knockdown and mix
[2:50:33] <DefaultSettiings> Pat got beat by a girl sofieGasp
[2:50:38] <+MMetas> This that thing that woolie was talking about where his older brother was adamant about using the big character and only heavy attacks, pat is the older brother now with the big mans getting slapped by smaller characters
[2:50:41] <gottigotbundles> level3
[2:50:46] <KeiPrime> i like using level 1s to get characters in but im not great at this game
[2:50:46] <tmix1600> Try to get back blue health
[2:50:46] <Leud_De_Grace> 21 kills her son 😢
[2:50:47] <Zombrocom> Swap out more, regen your blue health
[2:50:49] <%Niney_Who> yes like that
[2:50:50] <%ElenaManetta> i love broly's laugh every time
[2:50:54] <%zerocruz> Is the DMC demo available on the us already ?
[2:50:56] <DefaultSettiings> Pat just beat up a girl sofieGasp
[2:50:58] <KeiPrime> i havent even played it since like base goku
[2:51:00] <+GlewmanIII> not yet
[2:51:02] <%Trinity5> bruh upteching is literally the greatest
[2:51:02] <AlasterAngelo> @zerocruz in Japan
[2:51:07] <%Trinity5> so is downtech buttons LMAO
[2:51:09] <+GlewmanIII> EU too
[2:51:09] <%Niney_Who> WWHHAT
[2:51:10] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> whaaaat
[2:51:18] <+johnny_volcano> good job
[2:51:19] <lionmanguy> Activate
[2:51:19] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@PeaceCentennial)
[2:51:19] <%Toynota10> oh shit Max just went live with DBFZ! You should fight him!
[2:51:20] <%Nobrev> @zerocruz no. tomorrow. pat was using a NZ account for time zone fuckery
[2:51:21] <AlasterAngelo> @zerocruz if you have a JP account you can play it
[2:51:21] <%Trinity5> @iwishthiswasicq yo this this you?
[2:51:21] <+TheHeroAppears> what
[2:51:22] <buffmurffy> if you have some blue life you should level 1 into DHC, you do damage and will gain life back. its a net gain
[2:51:23] <fmc009> I got the DMCV download of the jpn psn
[2:51:24] <%iwishthiswasicq> Yikes, I'm worse than I remember.
[2:51:25] <KeiPrime> fuuuuuu-
[2:51:26] <Leud_De_Grace> WAT
[2:51:28] <AnimeJedi25> done and done
[2:51:28] <+VektorTroika> we need a broly dlc this season and bio broly next season so we can have team broly
[2:51:32] <+天使42199> pat won PogChamp
[2:51:33] <%ECRead> @AngriestPat Don't forget also, Air Dragon Rush (the grab) is a sliding knockdown after last patch.
[2:51:34] <fmc009> That's a dead
[2:51:35] <+Shastafield> there we go
[2:51:35] <%temsik> god, broly is fucking disgusting
[2:51:40] <%Niney_Who> Just stop being combo'd 4Head
[2:51:42] <%Rhinoprotoss> You have alot of blue health in this. Use DHC to switch
[2:51:42] <+GlewmanIII> hold tag when they're blockstringing you
[2:51:42] <%Trinity5> yeah you gotta find a good spot to do it
[2:51:44] <Xirn> you can guardcancel out
[2:51:44] <+QuadraticGravity> guard cancel or DHC
[2:51:45] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Not raw switch
[2:51:45] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> paat is saad
[2:51:46] <tmix1600> Guard cancel
[2:51:48] <%laserbeaming> You can switch during your combo
[2:51:51] <%afronooch> yeah just dont let them hit you
[2:51:52] <fmc009> @AngriestPat Guard Cancel or cover you tags
[2:51:53] <+johnny_volcano> @angriestpat guard cancel switch was buffed
[2:51:53] <AnimeJedi25> use assists to make switching safer
[2:51:53] <StarkMaximum> You are correct, you need to find a safe spot
[2:51:54] <+GlewmanIII> guard cancel is op now iirc
[2:51:54] <exalt4747> @VektorTroika New Broly will be coming.
[2:51:56] <+cahv123> Why bio broly(that which shouldn't be spoken of) instead of just Kale for team broly?
[2:51:56] <cedryk98> any situation where you could land the level 1, you can just save the ebar, try to do another combo and save the meter for living longer or securing a kill
[2:51:57] <septimberwolf> Switch Out during your combo
[2:51:57] <+GlewmanIII> so use that too
[2:51:57] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> When Pat was going up against fugginz he didn't switch out ONCE, even when he was dying
[2:51:58] <+a_deadbeat> Try to reflect sometimes. 4S
[2:51:59] <aeonicvector> yeah so some blockstring practice will go awhile
[2:51:59] <%Trinity5> well, everyone has that problem don't feel bad
[2:52:01] <+jjjkopf> Pat am I wrong for thinking the Jem'Hadar are lame
[2:52:05] <%tinyswampthing> @AngriestPat if you need to swtich out try and use an assist to try and cover it
[2:52:05] <%Toynota10> You think you can play against Max? he's on rn
[2:52:08] <+honorable_captain_garlock> reflect really sets stuff back to zero
[2:52:12] <+blademaster247> Stop getting opened up
[2:52:13] <fmc009> That's DBFZ tho, pressure is a fuck
[2:52:13] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Uh oh, which Videl
[2:52:14] <%BestTeaMaker> don't get hit
[2:52:14] <gottigotbundles> max is on PC
[2:52:15] <Limes528> Defense is super tough in this game. It's the one thing I don't like about it
[2:52:18] <NicholasKane> @AngriestPat consider lowering your mental threshold for what is "enough blue life to be worth switching out for"
[2:52:21] <DefaultSettiings> every time Android 21 isn't involved in this stream I get slightly more depressed.
[2:52:21] <+GlewmanIII> wake up level 3 then tag Kappa
[2:52:21] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> try jumping in?
[2:52:22] <cedryk98> too late once you're getting combod
[2:52:24] <Leud_De_Grace> VIDEL
[2:52:26] <+honorable_captain_garlock> if you get kockdown try reflecting on wakeup
[2:52:26] <+VektorTroika> that's why you gotta practice your blockstrings, duh
[2:52:27] <%FrostMass22> @jjjkopf They are engineered to be boring
[2:52:27] <KeiPrime> i think its more familarity that has to happen
[2:52:29] <+VektorTroika> so you don't get comob
[2:52:29] <Kaneis> In neutral you should try taking to the air a little more so that dragon rushes don't nail you as often
[2:52:30] <tmix1600> Guard cancel, DHC ,switch middle of a short combo
[2:52:32] <%Kravedarknesss> funimation is really going to be downplaying Broly for a good while and I don't blame them
[2:52:33] <cedryk98> wait till youre down to try and break out
[2:52:34] <%Toynota10> oh yeah he is on pc
[2:52:35] <InugamiTheHound> you get caught in their rhythm
[2:52:36] <aeonicvector> hrmm not SUPER familiar with the heavies so no strong answers beyond more practice turning momentum
[2:52:37] <+blademaster247> But for real momentum is a bitch to reverse in this game
[2:52:37] <+JohnXuandou> Pat why you so pringles
[2:52:38] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> BEST VIDEL
[2:52:41] <+QuadraticGravity> GOOD VIDEL
[2:52:51] <gottigotbundles> cuz of the curly mustache
[2:52:51] <Fujiwara_92> BAD VIDEL
[2:52:52] <KeiPrime> you just gotta put the time in for reals tho
[2:52:53] <CptBritches> WORST VIDEL
[2:52:55] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> @AngriestPat just go up against people who are too bad at the video game to combo you
[2:52:57] <KeiPrime> theres no quick answer
[2:52:57] <AlasterAngelo> BEST VIDEL
[2:52:58] <cedryk98> its just to get used to blocking high & low
[2:52:58] <%Trinity5> @JohnXuandou i can't fucking believe brian f played koihime
[2:52:58] <+chaos5338> best Videl!
[2:53:01] <InugamiTheHound> is cooler any fun to play as??
[2:53:01] <+VektorTroika> MEDIOCRE VIDEL
[2:53:01] <+honorable_captain_garlock> well you can know when its your turn to push buttons
[2:53:02] <StarkMaximum> calm down you idiots both videls are good videls
[2:53:03] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> ALL VIDEL ARE GOOD
[2:53:04] <+JohnXuandou> lmao
[2:53:06] <exalt4747> Can we not fight about Videl EVERY SINGLE TIME?
[2:53:08] <Ion_LaserX> DECENT VIDEL
[2:53:09] <+BorinCorran> There's such thing as a good Videl? LUL
[2:53:10] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> where is helmet videl ?
[2:53:10] <fmc009> @AngriestPat Learning gaps can be good but like overall defense, it will train reactions
[2:53:11] <+badchoice5> You need to become closer with your fighterz. See through their eyes, walk in their shoes.
[2:53:14] <CptBritches> BOTH VIDELS ARE BEST
[2:53:17] <Kalcom> when you find someone weak beat them again
[2:53:17] <lionmanguy> Now look for a chance to switch
[2:53:19] <%BestTeaMaker> when do we get saiyawoman
[2:53:20] <seycheles> dark videl
[2:53:20] <lionmanguy> SWITCH
[2:53:20] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> SAIYAWOMAN BEST
[2:53:22] <alrobot2014> all videls are created equal, but some are more equal than others
[2:53:22] <NicholasKane> GOOD DHC
[2:53:23] <AlasterAngelo> if your combos and strings are optimized there's more chance you'll kill them before they kill you
[2:53:26] <cedryk98> and learning to react to Dragon rushes
[2:53:27] <KeiPrime> i mean launch is better than videl so who cares
[2:53:28] <NicholasKane> DO IT AGAIN
[2:53:28] <Limes528> @InugamiTheHound I think so
[2:53:30] <tmix1600> There ya go
[2:53:30] <aeonicvector> I mean learn the common blockstrings that will be used on you, fnd the pattern to block
[2:53:32] <+VektorTroika> @Sir_Gawain_Lotsson this man gets it
[2:53:38] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> by git gud
[2:53:39] <Run44forrest> block more
[2:53:44] <aeonicvector> most players are creatures of habit
[2:53:47] <cedryk98> learning to block high & low, and reacting to Dr's
[2:53:49] <Run44forrest> dont always challenge
[2:53:49] <%Trinity5> @AngriestPat lab the blockstrings used against you
[2:53:53] <+Eclipse_knight_> milf videl is trash tier though
[2:53:53] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> That visor on the helmet is STYLIN'
[2:53:54] <+Dovakhin573> You learn when its safe to press a button
[2:53:55] <Xirn> it'll give you an understanding of the gaps in pressure, when it's your turn, etc
[2:53:55] <DefaultSettiings> Hit isn't wearing clothes btw. that's just his super fucked up anatomy
[2:53:57] <Leud_De_Grace> Insolence!
[2:53:58] <%Rhinoprotoss> You have to realize at some point there's gonna be a gap or an assist call to extend
[2:53:59] <+honorable_captain_garlock> The only thing I can think of is knowing the gaps in a blockstring
[2:54:01] <+MMetas> @AngriestPat You can get familiar with attacks coming in and counter them
[2:54:04] <AnimeJedi25> knowing when it's safe to go in
[2:54:06] <+badchoice5> The first step to improving at fighting games is not to read the chat during a match
[2:54:08] <+DFDEDSDCD> Learn how to use Ultra Instinct IRL.
[2:54:08] <lionmanguy> switch
[2:54:10] <tmix1600> If they are too aggressive try a reflect
[2:54:10] <+johnny_volcano> @angriestpat block low, react high. reflect on wakeup is valid if you don't abuse it and become predictable
[2:54:10] <rubbishbinge> Has Pat won yet?
[2:54:11] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> That definitely sounds like Mission Vao
[2:54:12] <StarkMaximum> I love how big Videl's shirt is it looks like she's wearing Gohan's shirt to sleep in
[2:54:12] <%Trinity5> @badchoice5 lmfao
[2:54:13] <fmc009> Great Sayiaman PogChamp
[2:54:13] <+BorinCorran> @DefaultSettiings W-what>
[2:54:18] <+a_deadbeat> So right there where you supered with Cooler, that would've been a good time to go into Broly or A16 to recover Cooler's blue health
[2:54:30] <Limes528> @rubbishbinge Once, I think
[2:54:36] <%Trinity5> THIS IS THE STANCE
[2:54:38] <%Trinity5> _/_/
[2:54:39] <+blademaster247> Also learn to implement assists better
[2:54:40] <%Trinity5> sajamHit
[2:54:40] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> _/_/
[2:54:42] <%PanicSwytch> Git gud Pat!
[2:54:42] <+GlewmanIII> use 236s after a 5H to make it a bit safer
[2:54:42] <rubbishbinge> Ooof
[2:54:44] <+QuadraticGravity> _/_/
[2:54:44] <%mayorrev> STANCE
[2:54:47] <+VektorTroika> Stance'd
[2:54:48] <AlasterAngelo> you guys remember when Gohan called Buu a retard
[2:54:49] <+GlewmanIII> with a16]
[2:54:49] <Gutsandlove> _/_/
[2:54:50] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> @AngriestPat can't get combo'd if you get bullied out of playing the game
[2:54:54] <Leud_De_Grace> “Foolish...”
[2:54:57] <%joylent_blue> HIT IS SO COOL
[2:54:58] <+VektorTroika> @AlasterAngelo boy DO I
[2:54:58] <cedryk98> imlementing assists at this stage would be to hard
[2:55:00] <gottigotbundles> any recommendations for who I should play against pat
[2:55:05] <cedryk98> he cant even bnb properly yet
[2:55:10] <SomersaultJustice> you need to hit the guy more than he hits you
[2:55:11] <%Trinity5> @gottigotbundles all blue team
[2:55:14] <+conradical> protip: do the thing better than your opponent
[2:55:15] <NicholasKane> @gottigotbundles his own characters
[2:55:16] <+honorable_captain_garlock> its real diffficult especially with the assists you have
[2:55:17] <septimberwolf> Train more with y
[2:55:18] <%Rhinoprotoss> Literally call an assist at the end of a blockstring
[2:55:20] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Beerus Tien and Yamcha
[2:55:21] <fabnanman> the dmc5 demo is out tonight?
[2:55:22] <%Trinity5> @gottigotbundles point vegito, blue goku, bluegeta
[2:55:24] <KeiPrime> not more, just harder, thats why he picks big guys
[2:55:29] <+blademaster247> Basically using them to extend combos to get kills without having to spend meter
[2:55:33] <%joylent_blue> fabnanman yessir, in 10 mins
[2:55:35] <Fujiwara_92> ppl here are like "learn to do the thing you aren't doing" wtf guys 4Head
[2:55:35] <Run44forrest> frieza piccolo goku black
[2:55:36] <%afronooch> @AngriestPat just tell them to stop their combo on you
[2:55:37] <+blademaster247> or extending blockstrings
[2:55:38] <StarkMaximum> I feel like this chat is equal amounts of "genuine advice" and "ironic git guds" and Pat keeps seeing the second and missing the former
[2:55:40] <%iwishthiswasicq> @gottigotbundles 18, Videl, Ginyu and spam assists.
[2:55:43] <gottigotbundles> team blue it is then big bois
[2:55:43] <fabnanman> @joylent_blue nice
[2:55:44] <CptBritches> Just grind some levels offscreen @angriestpat
[2:55:49] <tmix1600> Use broly armor then spark to get blue health back
[2:55:59] <BlacSoul> I was gonna say team goku
[2:55:59] <+QuadraticGravity> You got a new medal!
[2:56:02] <AlasterAngelo> @StarkMaximum the git guds aren't ironic I feel
[2:56:04] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> Fighting games are in that weird spot where I'm better at them than anyone I know personally, but I can't beat a single person online in any of them
[2:56:05] <septimberwolf> Train more with that team to get the assist timing down better
[2:56:08] <Nighthawkmun> Protip just be better than you currently are by winning
[2:56:12] <fmc009> @AngriestPat With this team, you can use your assists to make things that aren't safe, into safe. It needs practice but in neutral neither of these will help you open up. Also combo extensions
[2:56:16] <Kaneis> You can also use assists when you do a hard knockdown if they're too far away, then follow up with a blockstring
[2:56:20] <%Trinity5> @Sir_Gawain_Lotsson same in my friend group, except for smash
[2:56:20] <KiraKamixephos> And to learn how to do that you need to LAB
[2:56:21] <cedryk98> he really needs to understand the basic bnb and the timing before going ito using assists
[2:56:22] <StarkMaximum> @AlasterAngelo I mean "giy guds" where they're just like "yeah but do better tho" as opposed to "here's what you're doing wrong"
[2:56:24] <faegbeard> "Just git gud" — Chat Helpfulman, 2019
[2:56:25] <Run44forrest> spend 30 min in practice and learn some BnBs
[2:56:26] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@mr_slaide) (warning)
[2:56:27] <NicholasKane> @Sir_Gawain_Lotsson same
[2:56:28] <+honorable_captain_garlock> you can learn how to combo most assist out of a light combo ender in the air
[2:56:30] <AnimeJedi25> then go to the lab and practice it
[2:56:35] <+MMetas> It all comes down to labs!
[2:56:36] <mr_slaide> Pet Elmo. It will help you.
[2:56:37] <exalt4747> Pat, drop your shield!
[2:56:40] <%Trinity5> sliding knockdowns apatDab
[2:56:40] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @Sir_Gawain_Lotsson That's the best I've ever been. Now I'm all around scrub
[2:56:41] <exalt4747> See what I mean?
[2:56:42] <umm_idunno> watch some pro matches off-stream
[2:56:43] <exalt4747> PERFECT
[2:56:45] <+a_deadbeat> Stuff that gives knockdowns is just character specific and takes time to learn
[2:56:46] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> Patrick, just do your best.
[2:56:53] <Fujiwara_92> Then lab pat, then lab ...
[2:56:56] <person181> get some elmotional support
[2:56:57] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> @Trinity5 oh Smash is the exception. I'm worse than anyone I know at smash, and everyone I know is worse than anyone online.
[2:57:01] <AnimeJedi25> Just watch Max's steam. He's on right now.
[2:57:01] <+honorable_captain_garlock> like 4 lights knoksdown to ground where assist is waiting for them
[2:57:02] <Phantonbat> Just do it perfectly every time
[2:57:03] <%Trinity5> @Sir_Gawain_Lotsson lmfao
[2:57:04] <+blademaster247> Text Max for advice
[2:57:04] <c_drolet> No for honor?
[2:57:04] <deviljhojho94> Freeza themed team
[2:57:04] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> Grew up without smash bros.
[2:57:04] <+Promessa_EX> nuetral areil heavy does hard knockdown
[2:57:06] <StarkMaximum> AngryPat sure sounds moer like SadPat tonight and it's making me sad...
[2:57:09] <mr_slaide> Pet Elmo for emotional support.
[2:57:11] <Revant_tillywink> as long as your having FUN
[2:57:11] <+Promessa_EX> mix off that
[2:57:13] <cedryk98> the last heavy hit in the air is the opportunity to call an assist
[2:57:13] <+QuadraticGravity> You just said what to lab
[2:57:16] <aeonicvector> i dont know all the lockdowns/knockdowns yet, so cant help on that. sorry
[2:57:18] <Jackedalot123> Wish my Videl didn’t go out so quickly
[2:57:19] <DefaultSettiings> Pat, if you believe in yourself hard enough you will still not improve. get in the lab
[2:57:20] <Run44forrest> look up some videos
[2:57:24] <nobknee> @AngriestPat Hey, Pat. I lost touch with my best Friend tonight. Probably for good this time. Dunno how much longer I'll be up tonight, but I wanted to say thanks for bein' cool and fun. You're a good dude.
[2:57:26] <+Dovakhin573> But not with 16
[2:57:26] <Leud_De_Grace> Tag in Elmo to assist in fighting your opponent
[2:57:26] <fmc009> We need to make a lab portofolio
[2:57:28] <KiraKamixephos> We can send you combos
[2:57:29] <+QuadraticGravity> Except with specific characters
[2:57:29] <%GlewmanIII> not with 16
[2:57:30] <Xirn> it's character specific, not with 16
[2:57:31] <Limes528> Not for 16
[2:57:31] <+DFDEDSDCD> how do download dmc v demo?
[2:57:32] <%Trinity5> character specific @AngriestPat
[2:57:33] <+MMetas> You have to test EVERYTHING in a lab pat
[2:57:34] <%chiluzza> we re only 10 viewers away from max

[2:57:36] <+blademaster247> Throws give knockdowns now
[2:57:40] <+Promessa_EX> piccolo can't either
[2:57:42] <+johnny_volcano> @angriestpat Block default low and react high.
[2:57:43] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> Pat just switch to Shugoki
[2:57:43] <+a_deadbeat> Jump 5H does not universally give knockdowns lol
[2:57:44] <StarkMaximum> he's dead boi
[2:57:44] <Zombrocom> @AngriestPat It's character specific, there is no easy answer we can give you dude.
[2:57:44] <Fujiwara_92> LUL for the that does work
[2:57:45] <%Rhinoprotoss> It's not a hard knockdown, those are after level 3s
[2:57:48] <+honorable_captain_garlock> 16 has a weird ender
[2:57:50] <cedryk98> those moments when you use a level one are the moments to call an assist instead
[2:57:51] <IOptimusGrimes> switch 16 out
[2:57:52] <tmix1600> 16 doesnt hardknock down
[2:57:57] <smallboops> google the current popular combo on youtube and copy that, duh.
[2:57:58] <+ArcanumMBD> Pat playing on PS4?
[2:58:00] <TheShockVox> Is he playing on PC?
[2:58:01] <tmix1600> Switch out
[2:58:02] <Leud_De_Grace> 16 decides to plant a dumb ass tree
[2:58:03] <%Trinity5> ps4
[2:58:03] <%afronooch> yeah ps4
[2:58:05] <gottigotbundles> ps4
[2:58:07] <TheShockVox> Good
[2:58:12] <%Trinity5> GOOD DHC
[2:58:12] <TheShockVox> I want to fight him
[2:58:12] <+a_deadbeat> GOOD SWITCH
[2:58:13] <StarkMaximum> gottem
[2:58:14] <%GlewmanIII> im going to shit my pants if pat doesnt tag
[2:58:16] <%GlewmanIII> OH THANK GOD
[2:58:16] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> NICE SWITCH
[2:58:18] <%Rhinoprotoss> TAGo
[2:58:19] <aeonicvector> Damn good reaction
[2:58:19] <+VektorTroika> good switch
[2:58:20] <+Promessa_EX> fake it till you make it
[2:58:22] <fmc009> #SAVED
[2:58:22] <TheShockVox> What server is he on?
[2:58:25] <StarkMaximum> @GlewmanIII The pants are safe!
[2:58:26] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> nice
[2:58:28] <AlasterAngelo> oh look pat's learning
[2:58:34] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> that was cool
[2:58:37] <+Promessa_EX> they have to be launched high too
[2:58:37] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> OH NO HE HAS GINYU
[2:58:38] <Revant_tillywink> whats dhc?
[2:58:38] <%Rhinoprotoss> Why don't you just learn your characters??
[2:58:40] <%GlewmanIII> do J.H after the air launch
[2:58:42] <%afronooch> i think east coast canada 4
[2:58:43] <bronxlegendw232st> You don't switch out to regain blue health enough
[2:58:43] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> East Canada 4, password 1115?
[2:58:44] <%tinyswampthing> that was a weird interaction
[2:58:46] <%Trinity5> who plays cooler in here, hit em with a combo
[2:58:49] <%afronooch> or something like that
[2:58:49] <tmix1600> Dont worry about hardknock down
[2:58:50] <KiraKamixephos> We need someone there to help him
[2:58:50] <TheShockVox> @afronooch Thanks brother
[2:58:55] <%Trinity5> @Revant_tillywink delayed hyper combo i think
[2:58:55] <IOptimusGrimes> just do raw tags you dingus
[2:58:55] <StarkMaximum> @Revant_tillywink Delayed Hyper Combo is a Marvel vs Capcom term for when you do a super and then call someone in to do another super
[2:58:58] <Jackedalot123> I wonder if my spot will stay if I do ranked in the meantime
[2:59:03] <Run44forrest> delayed hyper combo its when you do super into super
[2:59:08] <+a_deadbeat> I wish I could be there in person to explain this stuff lol. Trying to teach via chat sucks
[2:59:09] <%Trinity5> NICE SPARKING BAIT
[2:59:10] <umm_idunno> just super dash nonstop
[2:59:11] <%Trinity5> HOLY SHIT
[2:59:12] <%Rhinoprotoss> None of your characters have easy sliding knockdown
[2:59:15] <+blademaster247> Easiest way to get a knockdown is to 2H then vanish then throw
[2:59:17] <cedryk98> if you use your double jump before your launcher you cant HKD
[2:59:18] <AlasterAngelo> just watch Chris Hu explaining DHC you'll understand
[2:59:19] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> YEYEYEYE
[2:59:19] <+Promessa_EX> okay do that with 16
[2:59:19] <StarkMaximum> Yeah like if you need a character out and you're just desperate even a raw tag is better than letting a character die
[2:59:20] <jobbedbone> why give advice if it has so many preconditions lol
[2:59:22] <aeonicvector> regen
[2:59:24] <KeiPrime> sparking dude
[2:59:24] <tmix1600> If the recover run after there recovery with buttons
[2:59:24] <+badchoice5> Sparking
[2:59:25] <%GlewmanIII> spark
[2:59:25] <%afronooch> @TheShockVox it may be meeting 4, I saw it in chat a while ago
[2:59:25] <fmc009> ARMOR BOYZ
[2:59:25] <+Promessa_EX> the slam good
[2:59:26] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> Man it's harder to tell what's going on on this screen now than while playing Warframe with Particle effects maxed
[2:59:26] <+QuadraticGravity> 16's lv 3 doesnt freeze sparking
[2:59:27] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> uh oh
[2:59:30] <Fujiwara_92> sparking
[2:59:32] <+SoriduSnaku> LUL
[2:59:34] <%GlewmanIII> spark does regen during a16's super
[2:59:34] <%Trinity5> well yeah, sparking lmfao
[2:59:35] <+Grayhammatter> he still had sparking
[2:59:36] <%Trinity5> it's abitch
[2:59:41] <NicholasKane> sparking still recovers health during cinematic supers
[2:59:45] <gottigotbundles> reactions
[2:59:50] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 3 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 12oz (360mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[2:59:50] <%GlewmanIII> only in the slow damage supers
[2:59:54] <+a_deadbeat> How in the world did you get j.2H to land mid screen?
[2:59:55] <%Trinity5> SPARK
[2:59:57] <+honorable_captain_garlock> if you had someone like vegeta or ssj goku assists would be a lot easier to string into combos
[2:59:57] <jobbedbone> You mean sparkling, right?
[2:59:58] <%GlewmanIII> nuke supers are better at sparking
[3:00:01] <fmc009> Up teching needs a hard nerf
[3:00:02] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> YOU CAN DO IT PATTT
[3:00:02] <%Trinity5> @jobbedbone nah
[3:00:03] <+Promessa_EX> hmm
[3:00:04] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> LUL
[3:00:06] <KeiPrime> DO IT
[3:00:06] <%HyperCharge_Sam> LUL
[3:00:08] <%GlewmanIII> LOL
[3:00:08] <%Trinity5> YEAH
[3:00:08] <%PanicSwytch> Hydrate
[3:00:09] <+Promessa_EX> ok
[3:00:10] <%Trinity5> WE DO IT
[3:00:10] <+a_deadbeat> Is that a large body only combo?
[3:00:10] <+Dovakhin573> PAT PLS
[3:00:10] <+QuadraticGravity> AGAIN
[3:00:10] <KeiPrime> YEA
[3:00:10] <cedryk98> he simply has to play more and learn for himself when things occur on his own before looking to learn more stuff, pat simply wont understand what to do before then
[3:00:11] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> We do it
[3:00:13] <StarkMaximum> GET BROLY'D
[3:00:13] <%ECRead> LUL
[3:00:13] <Run44forrest> stop
[3:00:13] <Zombrocom> @AngriestPat With Cooler, just use the flying knee attack as your ender, it's always a knockdown regardless of situation, 16 can't really knockdown at all, and Broly gets his knockdowns off air grab usually.
[3:00:14] <Fujiwara_92> TIME TO RAW
[3:00:14] <+Promessa_EX> Yuhhhh
[3:00:16] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> YAAAAAAY
[3:00:16] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> FIRST TRY
[3:00:17] <Run44forrest> oh my god
[3:00:18] <+ArcanumMBD> If they're in the corner you can do the full LMH > 236M in the area with 16. Or do LMH > SS > 236M
[3:00:18] <aeonicvector> the DOUBLE RAW strat Kappa
[3:00:18] <+VektorTroika> the broly level is MAXIMUM
[3:00:21] <Nighthawkmun> I have zero idea what is happening on screen rn
[3:00:21] <%HyperCharge_Sam> IT'S FUCKING RAWWWWWW
[3:00:21] <+Grayhammatter> raw super LUL
[3:00:23] <jobbedbone> @Trinity5 Sparking doesn't make sense tho
[3:00:23] <AnimeJedi25> raw everyday
[3:00:25] <%galaxyswirl> 2 RAW LVL 3????
[3:00:25] <exalt4747> What's with this stand that allows Pat to get away with that?
[3:00:26] <+Promessa_EX> m64StocksUp m64StocksUp m64StocksUp m64StocksUp
[3:00:28] <KeiPrime> if it dont wokr the first time JUST DO IT AGAIN
[3:00:31] <BlacSoul> Yeesh
[3:00:31] <nobknee> @AngriestPat Hey, Pat. I lost touch with my best Friend tonight. Probably for good this time. Dunno how much longer I'll be up tonight, but I wanted to say thanks for bein' cool and fun. You're a good dude.
[3:00:33] <Leud_De_Grace> First try 💪
[3:00:36] <%Prism_Wing> lul
[3:00:37] <aeonicvector> real talk though, your improving
[3:00:37] <+blademaster247> I'd say stop raw lvl 3 but it's working so whatever works I guess
[3:00:38] <%commanderclaw> apatHoldon
[3:00:42] <+seductivezz> It’s Vic Magnono
[3:00:43] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> MASH SUPERS
[3:00:44] <+badchoice5> Before you execute a Super, you must feel it in your kokoro ("heart of hearts")
[3:00:50] <Limes528> You're letting a lot of blue health go to waste. Try switching more.
[3:00:51] <+VektorTroika> nobody expects the same attack twice, NOBODY
[3:00:52] <bronxlegendw232st> If at first you don't succeed i guess LUL
[3:00:53] <Run44forrest> pat never stop blocking unless youre attacking
[3:01:03] <Zombrocom> Throw aint a hard knockdown, it leaves them airborne
[3:01:03] <%Trinity5> @jobbedbone its dbz lore, reference to the theme song i think
[3:01:06] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Vanish?
[3:01:13] <Xirn> you could do the hcf or hcb into tagged super
[3:01:15] <Xirn> or vanish
[3:01:16] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> always go in
[3:01:16] <cedryk98> call an assist on hit when youre really high
[3:01:20] <%TheStarbecue> learn the timing
[3:01:24] <Run44forrest> do assist Super Dash
[3:01:24] <+QuadraticGravity> at that point it just becomes muscle memory for timing
[3:01:25] <IOptimusGrimes> learn
[3:01:26] <gottigotbundles> sonicfoxcosplay theres a open spot in the ring match
[3:01:29] <%PanicSwytch> Never Stop Not Stopping
[3:01:29] <SomersaultJustice> is he playing ps4 or pc version?
[3:01:29] <dimmensional> what console are you playing on
[3:01:30] <+johnny_volcano> @angriestpat timing and practice
[3:01:30] <fmc009> yeah I know it's timing man
[3:01:32] <%Trinity5> ps4
[3:01:32] <aeonicvector> vanish on lighters, not sure on heavybois
[3:01:35] <cedryk98> do it just before the last hit if you are lower
[3:01:38] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> @Trinity5 Yeah it's the last part of the DBZ theme
[3:01:39] <+blademaster247> That was close
[3:01:39] <TheShockVox> Not seeing him in Canada 4
[3:01:40] <+a_deadbeat> Extending after the end of your combo that high in the air isn't really what you want to be doing anyway
[3:01:40] <%Rhinoprotoss> IT'S NOT A HARD KNOCKDOWN, it's a sliding knockdown
[3:01:42] <Zombrocom> Dont bother using assists in combos right now, just use them to make stuff safe or reset pressure
[3:01:51] <%Superstarsage> ... hit the buttons?
[3:01:54] <tmix1600> Before you launch up use ground resources
[3:02:01] <%voidthieff> Max is on MonkaS
[3:02:02] <cedryk98> hold down to fall faster
[3:02:05] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> double tap down
[3:02:05] <+Promessa_EX> there's enouigh time
[3:02:06] <%LixFury> Fast fall Kappa
[3:02:10] <%Superstarsage> OHHH you mean fast fall
[3:02:15] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> pat match up with max
[3:02:17] <KeiPrime> theres fast fall?
[3:02:19] <%GlewmanIII> yeah
[3:02:23] <IOptimusGrimes> depends on assists that'll pop you up high enough/hitstun all that
[3:02:25] <NicholasKane> ...there's fast fall in this game?
[3:02:25] <bronxlegendw232st> You have to fast fall like smash Kappa
[3:02:25] <KeiPrime> huh..
[3:02:26] <exalt4747> Don't only two characters have fast fall?
[3:02:26] <%GlewmanIII> to an extent
[3:02:35] <exalt4747> Adulthan and someone else
[3:02:40] <%ECRead> Max is on PC, chat
[3:02:40] <%Trinity5> @exalt4747 gohan and yamcha has a dive kick
[3:02:42] <%GlewmanIII> depends on the assist
[3:02:44] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Did Max spend the whole last stream in the lab? I left after a couple hours
[3:02:46] <IOptimusGrimes> because your timings wack
[3:02:46] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> Fast Fall is a button iirc
[3:02:48] <cedryk98> kay im confused about what hes confused on
[3:02:51] <%Trinity5> @Sir_Gawain_Lotsson nah
[3:02:52] <%GlewmanIII> some assists take longer to come out
[3:02:53] <%NWR_James> gettin worked
[3:02:54] <NicholasKane> Could it be that other people are using assists that stay out for longer?
[3:02:57] <Run44forrest> this is why you lab
[3:02:58] <+ArcanumMBD> @AngriestPat depends on the attack, and the assist. there's weird windows where you can press the button and you kind of just have to get used to it
[3:02:59] <%Superstarsage> also some assists only go on the ground
[3:03:01] <+honorable_captain_garlock> your team really isn't built for combo assists because your smash attacks don't knock people down towards your other assists most "normal" characters have that
[3:03:03] <+PeaceCentennial> Maybe you need a character with a better assist
[3:03:04] <%Superstarsage> I think Nappa is one of those
[3:03:06] <+blademaster247> It's honestly just one of those things you get a feel for as you play more
[3:03:13] <KeiPrime> thats why fuckin composition matters
[3:03:14] <fmc009> I love how the lobby people are all in a line. Literally a queue xD
[3:03:15] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> @nobknee I sent your message in as a donation, hopefully he sees it
[3:03:22] <Zombrocom> @AngriestPat We can't give you an answer for that because that answer is "IT DEPENDS"
[3:03:23] <%TheStarbecue> you might be holding forward during assist call if they just dont come out @AngriestPat
[3:03:26] <%Trinity5> S U P E R D A S H
[3:03:26] <%voidthieff> @ECRead doesnt this game have cross play though?
[3:03:27] <%Trinity5> apatDab
[3:03:28] <tmix1600> Depends on assist, different assist different timing
[3:03:29] <%GlewmanIII> the 2 superdashes in a row LOL
[3:03:30] <%BlueMoonBlues> QUITE CONFIDANT
[3:03:30] <%Trinity5> @voidthieff no
[3:03:43] <+badchoice5> What happened to playing Cell? You used to be really good with him
[3:03:46] <%voidthieff> @Trinity5 oh thanks
[3:03:48] <%ECRead> @voidthieff no
[3:03:53] <StarkMaximum> @badchoice5 He's not big enough!
[3:03:54] <gottigotbundles> in the corner you can combo into r2 lvl3 after 16 or cooler knocks them into it
[3:03:55] <%GlewmanIII> canadian resets
[3:03:55] <%Trinity5> oh shit he did it
[3:03:57] <%Trinity5> fuckin nice
[3:03:59] <StarkMaximum> This is big boy squad!!
[3:04:00] <IOptimusGrimes> your team composition sucks,
[3:04:00] <fmc009> Play the game don't worry about it xD
[3:04:02] <+honorable_captain_garlock> put em out of his missery
[3:04:03] <Zombrocom> Just do that
[3:04:04] <Leud_De_Grace> MY... PERFECTION!!! rip Cell
[3:04:04] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> the most important thing is to have fun
[3:04:05] <+QuadraticGravity> At this point we're confused as to what you're asking
[3:04:07] <FunkyRot> heyyo what gaemu is this?
[3:04:08] <+VektorTroika> more like BROLY SQUAD
[3:04:08] <StarkMaximum> @AngriestPat have you ever heard of Rooflemonger? He plays a team very similar to yours and I've been watching a lot of his videos.
[3:04:10] <+mugwugsampoo> Pog
[3:04:14] <IOptimusGrimes> team doesn't work well assists don't work well with each other
[3:04:15] <+ArcanumMBD> @AngriestPat chaining assists into combo is a finnicky thing you kind of just have to lab a bunch to get the feel for
[3:04:15] <+PeaceCentennial> Pat we're saying that once you're in the air, it all depends on what assist you have
[3:04:15] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> He means his assists don't come in in the right place, but other people's do
[3:04:16] <exalt4747> Is it coincedence or is Pat better at Broly than with the others?
[3:04:17] <+honorable_captain_garlock> do you mean when your trying to keep em in the corner?
[3:04:18] <FunkyRot> kaka is poop in spanish
[3:04:20] <%ElenaManetta> I love that Broly is so fucking big he blocks your third fighter
[3:04:22] <bronxlegendw232st> There you go u fucked him LUL
[3:04:31] <Leud_De_Grace> Smacking em with Broly is working out tho
[3:04:38] <IOptimusGrimes> you don't go up to the sky
[3:04:39] <%Rhinoprotoss> It literally depends on your team
[3:04:40] <NicholasKane> let's go, friend.
[3:04:40] <Revant_tillywink> @AngriestPat youll have to lab it to see when to use each assist in the combo theres no 1 perfect way to do it
[3:04:40] <cedryk98> basic assist string from the air > Jm, L,L,Jump, L,M,H>Assist>land, do a new combo, either starting with 2M or 5L and jump
[3:04:41] <+honorable_captain_garlock> thats not really when you use assists to combo
[3:04:46] <%babrukus> you do it before you get up in the air
[3:04:49] <%Trinity5> what does 16 air light auto combo do
[3:04:53] <%Trinity5> does it lead into dunk?
[3:04:54] <+honorable_captain_garlock> not when you smash up into the air
[3:04:55] <+blademaster247> The assist is before the 2H
[3:04:55] <sdgundum990> notification says DMC5. I want to call Pat a piece of shit but I know it's a limitation of the phone.
[3:04:57] <gottigotbundles> I'll show you
[3:04:58] <+ArcanumMBD> @AngriestPat with most characters neutral heavy will knock them to the ground. You picked weird characters
[3:04:58] <aeonicvector> assists more short hop then sky on heavies
[3:05:02] <tmix1600> Your team is meant for the ground game, air is bad, keep close to floor
[3:05:06] <+Llyrumi> pick better characters
[3:05:07] <+a_deadbeat> It depends on what attack you use in the combo to do your smash as well
[3:05:09] <+QuadraticGravity> what tmix said
[3:05:11] <Mr_pwng3> half circle forward assist does that persons lvl 1 or 3 without doing yours, so you can do that
[3:05:11] <+honorable_captain_garlock> just before the smash attack
[3:05:13] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> Heavy to smash down, assist to get them @AngriestPat
[3:05:14] <%GlewmanIII> it can be
[3:05:15] <fmc009> depends per team man also
[3:05:15] <+SoriduSnaku> after you use 16's dunk use the assist
[3:05:15] <model_gx> only gotenks can use assits high in the air
[3:05:23] <Kalcom> someone beat pat with his team
[3:05:29] <c_drolet> Gitgud
[3:05:33] <%GlewmanIII> it really depends on the assist and the team comp in general pat
[3:05:34] <+blademaster247> There that
[3:05:35] <+PeaceCentennial> The problem is Pat is that this isn't universal
[3:05:37] <+a_deadbeat> If you only 2H in combos with Broly and Cooler, its much more difficult to use assists
[3:05:37] <cedryk98> he did it just now!
[3:05:39] <+blademaster247> With cooler
[3:05:39] <%GlewmanIII> it's going to drastically alter how you use assists
[3:05:40] <cedryk98> wtf
[3:05:43] <+honorable_captain_garlock> yeah its almost impossible to combo with assist up there
[3:05:44] <KantusMonkus> whats the ring password
[3:05:46] <+ArcanumMBD> @AngriestPat before the 2H depending on the assist. You just gotta lab it. Or watch combo videos
[3:05:48] <+Mr_Kooly> @AngriestPat you could also superdash after you grab with 16 and do L M Jump L M then grab for dunk
[3:05:50] <%iwishthiswasicq> Yeah, if you 2H, it's hard to have assists extensions after that for most character.
[3:05:54] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> @AngriestPat good superdash punish
[3:05:55] <cedryk98> you did it just nowmy man!
[3:06:03] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> cutie
[3:06:05] <%TheStarbecue> this is hard cuz a lot of this stuff is sorta charcter specific
[3:06:05] <+PeaceCentennial> oh those are some good 21 colors
[3:06:07] <%drabberfaun535> did i miss dmc5?
[3:06:09] <Ion_LaserX> @KantusMonkus 1115
[3:06:10] <%Superstarsage> Yes
[3:06:14] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> @drabberfaun535 yes
[3:06:16] <Mr_pwng3> half circle and hit assist if uoure too high up is my recommendation
[3:06:17] <KantusMonkus> thanks
[3:06:27] <+a_deadbeat> If you do 5H instead, you'll be lower to the ground, making it more feasible to use assists for extension
[3:06:31] <+badchoice5> Have you tried slapping the controller out of your opponent
[3:06:34] <+badchoice5> hand?
[3:06:34] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> YAMCHA'D
[3:06:39] <+PeaceCentennial> look at that switch
[3:06:41] <Xirn> yeah HCF or HCB if you get a sliding knockdown too high to convert off with your point character
[3:06:42] <cedryk98> essentially just call assist as you are about to send them down, and just feel the timing
[3:06:42] <Triplicat> there's that Meno guy that makes super basic combo demos for like every DBFZ/SF5/BBTAG character
[3:06:42] <+PeaceCentennial> that was a safe switch
[3:06:47] <%Superstarsage> Sick assist timing
[3:06:51] <+PenmanLupine> Walk up on that Yamcha and BURY HIM
[3:06:53] <KeiPrime> awoooooooooooo
[3:06:53] <Leud_De_Grace> YAM CHAD
[3:06:54] <fmc009> He almost got the assist down
[3:06:56] <%Trinity5> @Sir_Gawain_Lotsson yamcha's pretty top tier in this game
[3:06:57] <Jaysky> Yamcha > Broly
[3:07:01] <%Trinity5> @Sir_Gawain_Lotsson so yamchad is not wrong
[3:07:02] <%GlewmanIII> good tag
[3:07:04] <+ArcanumMBD> @AngriestPat using chat to learn this is terrible because it's all character and assist specific. Gotta lab or watch videos
[3:07:18] <+a_deadbeat> With Broly, you probably won't be able to get a follow up after the air grab because it side switches
[3:07:22] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> COMPETENT FOOL
[3:07:26] <%GlewmanIII> those assists were good too
[3:07:28] <NicholasKane> @AngriestPat Good match, friend. I'm quite rusty.
[3:07:29] <%Sulliman34> that was a clean blockstring dude
[3:07:29] <+a_deadbeat> with an assist I mean
[3:07:30] <%GlewmanIII> kept them guessing for longer
[3:07:31] <+honorable_captain_garlock> that was really good blockstringing pat
[3:07:32] <fmc009> The strings PogChamp
[3:07:38] <mr_gentleman96> @AngriestPat Check your twitter. Made some fan art of you
[3:07:38] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> @Trinity5 Yamcha's cool, it's a shame Toriyama has joined in on bullying him
[3:07:38] <+blademaster247> I'd say don't worry too much about assists at the moment and focus more on learning to approach safely
[3:07:46] <+QuadraticGravity> You did good this round =w=
[3:07:52] <cedryk98> i swear he used the assist for the extention already
[3:07:52] <%3xgilly> is the DMC 5 demo out for anyone yet?
[3:07:55] <%Trinity5> yeah i get you, Pat
[3:07:56] <Zombrocom> Pat is improving in realtime
[3:07:57] <DSD24> I love Cooler so much
[3:07:58] <+badchoice5> Plus, half of chat is actually worse at this than you, at least
[3:07:59] <%Trinity5> i was the same way
[3:07:59] <cedryk98> i seen it
[3:08:00] <%korth367> ask woolie lol
[3:08:00] <+PeaceCentennial> because assists are per character
[3:08:01] <mr_slaide> Pet Elmo you fuck.
[3:08:06] <%iwishthiswasicq> Honestly, I'm just waiting for P5A anyway.
[3:08:06] <Xirn> @3xgilly yeah it's out NZ/AU etc
[3:08:09] <mikesapartment> weave assists between combo strings
[3:08:11] <fmc009> @3xgilly I have it but I'm getting it on JPN PSN
[3:08:12] <KeiPrime> thats why you gotta practice, theres no shortcuts
[3:08:13] <exalt4747> I've had assist trouble for th elongest time but i've gotten better
[3:08:14] <+honorable_captain_garlock> its easiest to use them with the basic bitch characters I.E. sayins main cast
[3:08:17] <+a_deadbeat> Defense is the hardest part of DBFZ
[3:08:19] <%Rhinoprotoss> I wonder why people don't play fighting games....
[3:08:19] <Mr_pwng3> DMC 5 Demo finally came to ps4?
[3:08:20] <PerrinGoldeneyes> The irony of getting an Apex Legends ad here is palpable
[3:08:20] <Fujiwara_92> EL HERMANO
[3:08:22] <%GlewmanIII> you've gotta try reflect on wakeup more
[3:08:25] <%korth367> EL PAYASO
[3:08:25] <+a_deadbeat> especially online
[3:08:26] <+BorinCorran> @Sir_Gawain_Lotsson Yamcha should've been in the ToP instead of Tien. But at the same time he probably would've done about as poorly.
[3:08:28] <%Dr_DangerPhD> I notice that on block or neutral you tend to superdash, you would be better served learning how to instant air dash overhead for approach
[3:08:28] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> just b urself ;)
[3:08:30] <misterbackdown> Hey guys, how was the DMC5 demo?
[3:08:32] <InugamiTheHound> does cooler still have the same voice like in DBZ movie? Or is this a new voice actor?
[3:08:33] <+blademaster247> Forget about assists for now and focus on defense and neutral
[3:08:33] <fmc009> Defense is waaaaayyyyyy too bad in this game
[3:08:35] <+biggysweet> PM. don't play with assist. this isn't evo just play.
[3:08:38] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> The Clown
[3:08:39] <+honorable_captain_garlock> do it tho
[3:08:41] <%GingaNZ> defense is hard in this game
[3:08:42] <cedryk98> you should crouch block anything that isnt an overhead or aerial attack
[3:08:43] <+PeaceCentennial> Like Pat, I play BBTAG. In that game, assists can even be normals
[3:08:44] <%GlewmanIII> I don't think I've seen you reflect since I started watching
[3:08:45] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Fitting
[3:08:45] <DSD24> I want Gohan Blanco in this game
[3:08:45] <Jaysky> That Jiren color is awful
[3:08:46] <+honorable_captain_garlock> its a good way to not
[3:08:48] <+VektorTroika> Crayola Jiren
[3:08:50] <fmc009> You have Guard Cancel and Reflect........ That's it
[3:08:55] <Run44forrest> reflect and do an attack with long reach like 5H
[3:08:57] <godgamernoc> diediediediediediediediediediedie
[3:08:58] <+Promessa_EX> why couldn't we have el hermano
[3:08:59] <%Superstarsage> Part of your problem is lack of reflect and teamcomp. Frame data is frame data, and fatties and frame data don't mix.
[3:09:01] <+Grayhammatter> good god, these colors
[3:09:01] <+cahv123> It's all about timing pat.
[3:09:05] <%afronooch> ....is that TieTuesday?
[3:09:05] <+a_deadbeat> I'm glad you're using 5M more
[3:09:09] <Xirn> reflect was the weirdest thing to adjust to from other FGs for me, but with 16 you have stuff like reflect -> 5H which will maul people
[3:09:10] <Triplicat> You can also backdash on wakeup.
[3:09:11] <%Trinity5> Can pat's team extend off of dunk i don't know
[3:09:11] <Zombrocom> I feel like you challenge things way too much and it gets you hit, but that's just me
[3:09:11] <+VektorTroika> out here with his buddy RoseArt Zamasu
[3:09:12] <+PeaceCentennial> This game does have an issue with not having enough defense issues
[3:09:15] <cedryk98> you should crouch block anything that isnt an overhead or aerial attack
[3:09:16] <%PanicSwytch> Elmo Is A Better Player Than Pat! Elmo Is Future Evo 2019 Champ
[3:09:17] <+honorable_captain_garlock> you keep reflecting untill you find a gap then you 2m them
[3:09:17] <%vincerocmm> boi jerrin be swimming in strawberries
[3:09:19] <T_Sasquatch> wtf is that shit jiren color
[3:09:23] <fmc009> Jiren LUL
[3:09:23] <tmix1600> Thats just Jiren being good pat, reflect is fine
[3:09:25] <%3xgilly> Im just have a US PSN and I imagined that it would come out at midnight
[3:09:25] <+blademaster247> No
[3:09:27] <+honorable_captain_garlock> noooooo
[3:09:27] <+QuadraticGravity> It does not
[3:09:27] <%GlewmanIII> yes
[3:09:28] <cedryk98> NOPE
[3:09:28] <%Rhinoprotoss> No
[3:09:31] <+sindrantz> now it does
[3:09:32] <%GlewmanIII> it just got invuln didn't it
[3:09:32] <%Prophet_v3> NOOO
[3:09:33] <+johnny_volcano> No
[3:09:33] <%GlewmanIII> in the new patch
[3:09:33] <Fujiwara_92> no
[3:09:33] <%GingaNZ> no
[3:09:34] <%ECRead> it does now
[3:09:34] <Gutsandlove> no
[3:09:36] <+Mr_Kooly> it doesnt at all
[3:09:38] <%GlewmanIII> yes it does you fools
[3:09:38] <fmc009> HELL NAH
[3:09:38] <+a_deadbeat> backdash does not have invincibility
[3:09:40] <Gutsandlove> but it was buff
[3:09:41] <+QuadraticGravity> @GlewmanIII nope, it just goes farther
[3:09:41] <%GlewmanIII> it jsut got patched
[3:09:43] <BadgerDK> no it's pretty risky at times even
[3:09:44] <%GlewmanIII> ah fuck
[3:09:45] <StarkMaximum> See this is why asking Twitch chat is awful
[3:09:46] <TheShockVox> Alright just a reminder, what server is he in? Because I’m not seeing it in east coast Canada 4
[3:09:48] <%GlewmanIII> I was owned by twitter again
[3:09:49] <tmix1600> No but its fast and cover distance
[3:09:50] <%GingaNZ> distance buff
[3:09:52] <StarkMaximum> We've gotten like 2/3 "NO" and 1/3 "yeah it does"
[3:09:53] <sdgundum990> happy birthday
[3:09:54] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> @BorinCorran I liked how Frieza acted in ToP but I thought it was super unneccessary for Skinnybuu to become fatbuu again at the last minute. I thought getting closer to Super Buu was a good change.
[3:09:58] <%Prophet_v3> no'
[3:10:02] <+honorable_captain_garlock> im like 90% sure no
[3:10:04] <fmc009> Nice Gotenks extension
[3:10:05] <IOptimusGrimes> who told all you guys it invul? lmfaoo
[3:10:06] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Password 1115 @TheShockVox
[3:10:07] <+honorable_captain_garlock> even after patch
[3:10:08] <NicholasKane> @TheShockVox he put the ring in the middle of the arena
[3:10:09] <+thebadpope> To snap out. You can auto combo the opponent into the air and on the second hit in the air, teleport attack and mash the rush attack button. You'll catch them bouncing off the wall.
[3:10:10] <+cahv123> Reflect works on someone who goes in on you and pressess buttons but if they time themselves and bait you it fails. It's very much reading your opponent. Right now you lack knowledge. And wake up reflect doesn't work the same against every character.
[3:10:11] <IOptimusGrimes> its not
[3:10:13] <c_drolet> It’s because you’re old Patrick
[3:10:15] <%GlewmanIII> think I saw nakkiel say something about it
[3:10:21] <%GlewmanIII> but I might just be fucking insane
[3:10:27] <Press_Any> is this the ugliest jiren colour
[3:10:27] <%GlewmanIII> I'm also uhhh not sober
[3:10:28] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> JIREN GOT A BLACK EYE
[3:10:31] <tmix1600> You can use backdash as a get off
[3:10:32] <Press_Any> he looks like a clown
[3:10:35] <%Sulliman34> anyone know why the dmc5 demo isnt showing up on the store yet
[3:10:36] <+blademaster247> Just focus on blocking and punishing. Stop going in for a minute
[3:10:38] <+ArcanumMBD> @Sir_Gawain_Lotsson don't worry, the manga is doing more stuff with Buu that SURELY won't end in disappointment
[3:10:39] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> GOT SOME TROUBLE IN tHE SPACE RANGERS
[3:10:45] <+BorinCorran> @Sir_Gawain_Lotsson Like a lot of Dragon Ball the ToP had some missed opportunities. I still enjoyed it but there were problems.
[3:10:48] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> he attacc, but also, he attacc
[3:10:50] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @Press_Any His name is literally Spanish for The Clown
[3:10:50] <Leud_De_Grace> Broly is so nice giving everyone presents
[3:10:51] <%gessho> backdashing to get people off you isn't a great idea
[3:10:57] <cedryk98> blocking is probably the worst part of this game, you can be sitting there for 40+ seconds if you dont guard cancel
[3:10:59] <tmix1600> Press_Any thats the point
[3:11:06] <%GlewmanIII> GOOD tag patrick
[3:11:07] <%GingaNZ> dont press a button after blocking a vanish grounded
[3:11:08] <StarkMaximum> he attacc, he attacc, but more importantly, he never switch bacc
[3:11:24] <fmc009> The spark to cut the momentum
[3:11:26] <+honorable_captain_garlock> vanish is safe on block most of the time pat be careful
[3:11:29] <+Floofiie> As a cooler main is there potential in his combos :/
[3:11:33] <%iwishthiswasicq> The lack of defensive options really killed the fun of this game for me.
[3:11:35] <exalt4747> People are saying that Gotenks is the best character in the game rn
[3:11:36] <Zombrocom> Vanish is PLUS on block
[3:11:39] <+BorinCorran> @Leud_De_Grace I mean the new movie was in the Arctic...BROLY = SANTA CONFIRMED!?
[3:11:44] <%GlewmanIII> it's hard to do online but you can react with 2h to vanish
[3:11:45] <%Sulliman34> you have to spark earlier and lower to the ground
[3:11:46] <AlasterAngelo> do fusion characters like Gotenks and Gogeta have two dicks
[3:11:47] <TheShockVox> @nicholaskane In east coast Canada? Which one?
[3:11:52] <%GlewmanIII> all 4
[3:11:54] <cedryk98> LMHS
[3:11:56] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> @BorinCorran there were definitely lots of problems. Zen-Oh was the dumbest and most pointless character (this is getting out of hand, now there are two of them), right up next to that idol girl who was ugly on the outside AND the inside
[3:11:57] <Leud_De_Grace> This... ENERGYyYyYyY!
[3:12:00] <+Mr_Kooly> just catch em with 2m on the floor
[3:12:01] <+blademaster247> A LOT of this stuff comes with practice, you can't just do it.
[3:12:01] <tmix1600> Cooler has combo options yeah
[3:12:02] <Zombrocom> Lower to the ground
[3:12:02] <StarkMaximum> I don't think he meant "what input is it", guys
[3:12:04] <Run44forrest> when you drop a combo stop hitting buttons and block
[3:12:06] <+Mr_Kooly> before the smash tho
[3:12:07] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> do combo
[3:12:08] <%GlewmanIII> do sparking low to the ground before air knockup
[3:12:08] <BadgerDK> everything is jum cancelable in sparking even on block
[3:12:10] <StarkMaximum> I think he meant "how do i use it efficiently in this context"
[3:12:11] <+VektorTroika> so much Broly goin on
[3:12:12] <%Dr_DangerPhD> Pat you tend to default to superdashing during a scramble/neutral/air recovery, it would help you out a lot to start using instant air dash overheads to approach, you can use assists to make them safe
[3:12:13] <BadgerDK> jump*
[3:12:14] <Gutsandlove> dont worry
[3:12:14] <%Trabnaxes> bum1
[3:12:15] <+ArcanumMBD> @AngriestPat you spark relatively close to the ground. Then time your attack to when they're about to hit the ground
[3:12:16] <+honorable_captain_garlock> oh yeah you can spark anytime in a combo they will pop up and you can catch em with 2 m
[3:12:16] <+a_deadbeat> If you superdash someone and want to continue the combo, pop sparking
[3:12:26] <+PeaceCentennial> god I can't wait to get rid of this broly
[3:12:26] <KiraKamixephos> You gotta lab is how you use it
[3:12:26] <cedryk98> Oh whenever you character is besides theirs they will bounce off the ground for a free combo
[3:12:28] <arkv01> MAXimum
[3:12:36] <+honorable_captain_garlock> yeh
[3:12:38] <fmc009> Any hit, spark, after the first bounce they are out
[3:12:39] <StarkMaximum> "spark on the floor"
[3:12:39] <Xirn> yeah sparking has a hitbox, so you can spark then pick them back up
[3:12:40] <%vincerocmm> apatBig shadbaseChad
[3:12:41] <%GlewmanIII> or close to the ground
[3:12:43] <+JohnXuandou> sparking is Persona 4 Arena One More Burst
[3:12:43] <%Trinity5> sparking combos are actually some of the coolest shit
[3:12:45] <+JohnXuandou> it's the same
[3:12:46] <+BorinCorran> @Sir_Gawain_Lotsson Zen-Oh made everything substantially less hype every time they cut to them. I can't stand them and I hope they never show up again.
[3:12:47] <TheShockVox> Found it
[3:12:52] <%GlewmanIII> doesn't have to be on the floor but low air combos
[3:12:52] <nobknee> Do lab, tho.
[3:12:53] <+MechaBaphomet> Lab tho
[3:12:56] <+a_deadbeat> you can spark in the air and both of you will fall to the ground, usually giving you enough time to follow up
[3:12:58] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> The locker
[3:13:00] <%Sulliman34> us telling you what to practice now is going to be forgotten
[3:13:02] <NicholasKane> @TheShockVox There you go. don't forget to line up.
[3:13:02] <+ArcanumMBD> @AngriestPat just pull up the WORST combo videos on youtube and watch them with chat
[3:13:03] <+honorable_captain_garlock> practice practicing
[3:13:03] <+badchoice5> If you practice hard enough you'll win
[3:13:04] <+Grayhammatter> but do lab, tho
[3:13:06] <StarkMaximum> YEah you're trying to learn mid-game which seems really challenging
[3:13:07] <+PeaceCentennial> lab your assists
[3:13:07] <nobknee> No, do lab, tho.
[3:13:10] <+miguelrod777> play fallout
[3:13:11] <fmc009> Lab will never end tho
[3:13:11] <%CaptainPileDriver> @AngriestPat what lobby?
[3:13:11] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> 745
[3:13:12] <%trnzero> @AngriestPat Lab the Locker tho
[3:13:12] <%ElenaManetta> hit the stream labs. read some donations
[3:13:14] <InugamiTheHound> I saw on youtube SJW are after vic mignogna and he got fired from RWBY
[3:13:14] <+MechaBaphomet> You have lab
[3:13:15] <+PeaceCentennial> you know exactly what you need to lab
[3:13:15] <%GingaNZ> watching match footage would be a start
[3:13:17] <seylumiue> Look up combo videos
[3:13:17] <Run44forrest> look up broly combo
[3:13:17] <%HyperCharge_Sam> google some optimized bnb combos
[3:13:18] <+PeaceCentennial> it's your assists
[3:13:19] <%galaxyswirl> okay i dont know fighting games, WTF is a lab???
[3:13:20] <Leud_De_Grace> VIDEL
[3:13:23] <tmix1600> Sparking combos are kind of complex
[3:13:24] <person181> make a lab to tell you what to lab
[3:13:24] <%Aztec50> find a combo guide video online maybe, and then try to do the combos
[3:13:25] <KiraKamixephos> Well you gotta get in there first
[3:13:25] <fmc009> Yes, but there are a lot of directions in this chat xD
[3:13:26] <%Trinity5> @galaxyswirl training mode
[3:13:26] <Fujiwara_92> do lab is the new do combo 4Head
[3:13:26] <%gessho> Chocolate 21 is the only real choice
[3:13:27] <%iwishthiswasicq> @galaxyswirl Training mode
[3:13:29] <nobknee> why you no do lab
[3:13:31] <%CaptainPileDriver> anybody know the lobby?
[3:13:31] <%babrukus> google any character TOD and they'll use sparking in the combo, can prolly get some inspiration there
[3:13:32] <%gessho> anything else is inferior
[3:13:32] <ArtThouBored> I miheard that as Paige telling him to lab
[3:13:32] <StarkMaximum> @galaxyswirl Studying stuff and experimenting in training mode
[3:13:34] <+honorable_captain_garlock> cooler wanted a piece
[3:13:36] <+a_deadbeat> good guard cancel
[3:13:39] <+MMetas> @AngriestPat You're not supposed to practice one thing you're supposed to practive familiarity with everything
[3:13:40] <cedryk98> try to extend a bsic auto cmbo using asiists in the lab till you get a feel for it
[3:13:40] <%Superstarsage> Everything you've been mad about is the thing to lab if i'm understanding it right.
[3:13:43] <+ArcanumMBD> Oh man, that waifu team. 21, Videl, and Vegeta. Ultimate waifus Kreygasm
[3:13:45] <StarkMaximum> @ArtThouBored WHO'S TALKING
[3:13:47] <gottigotbundles> east Canada 4
[3:13:47] <+biggysweet> I get stuck in lab just doing bnbs. lab is not always the answer.
[3:13:48] <+bigb00gi3> where's shantae colors for 21 TakeNRG gimme gimme
[3:13:50] <fmc009> I like team big boy
[3:13:54] <arkv01> keep doing that thing 21 Kreygasm
[3:13:54] <+badchoice5> Go to the lab each day, and do 1000 punches. By the end of the month, you'll be able to simply out-punch your opponents!
[3:13:59] <Leud_De_Grace> Vegeta is best waifu
[3:14:02] <chester804> I feel your frustration Pat, I'd lab too but wtf am I supposed to lab, I get blown up on defense as well and it's frustrating to not know why or how to fix it
[3:14:05] <%iwishthiswasicq> @bigb00gi3 There's a mod for that on the PC.
[3:14:08] <T_Sasquatch> chocolate 21 .....
[3:14:10] <+bigb00gi3> hellllll yeah
[3:14:10] <+honorable_captain_garlock> see now that bar is wasted
[3:14:11] <T_Sasquatch> my wallet
[3:14:13] <hntronium> WRONG VIDEL
[3:14:13] <seylumiue> @CaptainPileDriver eastern canada 4, password 1115
[3:14:13] <T_Sasquatch> nooooo
[3:14:20] <+PeaceCentennial> god videl is so cool
[3:14:21] <%Trinity5> NICE GUARD CANCEL
[3:14:22] <+a_deadbeat> another good guard cancel
[3:14:23] <%Trinity5> THAT WAS GOOD
[3:14:23] <chester804> k
[3:14:25] <Run44forrest> but pat can barely do combo he needs to learn Big Boy BnBs
[3:14:28] <%CaptainPileDriver> @seylumiue thanks
[3:14:30] <+ArcanumMBD> When in doubt, super dash in
[3:14:33] <Gutsandlove> RIGHT VIDEL
[3:14:36] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> I don't understand the love for that 21 color. She's not a nubian goddess, she just looks like she's made of chocolate
[3:14:38] <Huntercd> Long hair Videl the best
[3:14:40] <cedryk98> defence in this game is entirely experience based, you gotta know the other characters arsenal and be prepared to block correctly for it
[3:14:44] <c_drolet> The invisible hand of the Lab will guide you!!
[3:14:47] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> @BorinCorran "Wow, so exciting!" "Wow, so cool!" It's like they were trying to tell us how we would have reacted as kids to the moments, and it was super dumb and annoying. Deserved no screentime. I also got super pissed when the Idol girl who was always talking about beauty and love mocked Krillin & 18 because she didn't consider Krillin attractive. Wanted 18 to strangle her.
[3:14:53] <Naho_Saenoki> @Sphincter_Spelunker Exactly/.
[3:14:54] <%ECRead> @AngriestPat generally, yes, spark on the floor. Broly has some fun stuff in the air though using sparking and air dash to switch sides and continue combo
[3:14:57] <%gessho> @Sphincter_Spelunker that doesn't make it worse at all it's fine either way
[3:15:04] <son_lefty> when they jump and dash with a heavy block standing then block crouching
[3:15:06] <exalt4747> At the very least Pat, look up combos for the characters you want toplay.
[3:15:06] <%iwishthiswasicq> Waifu made of chocolate, what's to get?
[3:15:06] <nobknee> @Sphincter_Spelunker Don't ya wanna have her omnomnom
[3:15:07] <T_Sasquatch> @Sphincter_Spelunker brown is brown
[3:15:08] <StarkMaximum> dunk her pigtails
[3:15:11] <Leud_De_Grace> Aww, no more presents from Broly
[3:15:14] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> Videl is more powerful than Brolly confirmed.
[3:15:23] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> D O W N Y O U G O
[3:15:25] <+a_deadbeat> With 16, you can't do two of the same grab in a combo
[3:15:25] <arkv01> brolly was just being a gentleman
[3:15:32] <+VektorTroika> Spopovich more powerful than Broly confirmed
[3:15:35] <exalt4747> Broly gave us the present of making himself a better character.
[3:15:36] <%CaptainPileDriver> in this game videl is stupid good
[3:15:38] <TheShockVox> @sir_gawain_lotsson Blame Toei. I fully expected her to find Krillin beautiful. And the manga for Super had her do exactly that. She thought krillin was hot
[3:15:40] <King___Crimson> "Leave Jiren to me." -videl
[3:15:42] <+BorinCorran> @Sir_Gawain_Lotsson Remember. Ribbriane lasted longer than Hit. Her only contribution was A17 shooting her mid transformation. Because he's a good boi and it was super funny.
[3:15:42] <StarkMaximum> yourpowerisinfiNITESIMAL
[3:15:42] <fmc009> DOUBLE DUNK
[3:15:45] <%CaptainPileDriver> unlike 17 her rekka's are good
[3:15:47] <cedryk98> hes using assists to extendd his dunk tho...
[3:15:52] <%ABajaChalupa> @AngriestPat hey :)
[3:15:55] <+honorable_captain_garlock> o fuk
[3:15:58] <nobknee> I take fightin' game matches to be canon, so I see it like everyone is equal in power. Yamcha can beat up Beerus.
[3:15:59] <Pnutz409> Woolie has taught you well
[3:16:00] <%gessho> @AngriestPat you can super dash after that cooler assist to get another air series
[3:16:00] <+Grayhammatter> o crap
[3:16:01] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> waifu powar
[3:16:03] <arkv01> "Leave Xehanort to me" - Jiren
[3:16:03] <StarkMaximum> Excuse me, young girl! Please stop kicking my face!!
[3:16:04] <+QuadraticGravity> Videl REFUSES to calm down
[3:16:04] <%CaptainPileDriver> THE BALLS
[3:16:04] <cedryk98> cant he just experiment using it at the end of an auto combo?
[3:16:06] <Xirn> there you go
[3:16:09] <+biggysweet> screen carry wtf
[3:16:13] <Leud_De_Grace> Videl is angery
[3:16:17] <fmc009> THAT'S THE DO IT
[3:16:20] <son_lefty> nice
[3:16:21] <%Rhinoprotoss> Air dash after level 3!!!!
[3:16:22] <+DK_Rance> @nobknee cmonBruh
[3:16:23] <person181> videl yips like a dog
[3:16:24] <%GlewmanIII> nope
[3:16:25] <%TheStarbecue> We DO IT SON
[3:16:27] <+a_deadbeat> If you land on the ground, you can superdash again
[3:16:28] <+QuadraticGravity> You can super dash once you hit the ground
[3:16:29] <%Sulliman34> once per ground touch
[3:16:29] <%CaptainPileDriver> damn
[3:16:29] <%Trinity5> @nobknee a team of gotenks, yamcha, and adult gohan is the strongest team in canon then
[3:16:30] <raveous> absolutely not
[3:16:31] <+blademaster247> When you touch the ground you can super dash again
[3:16:32] <BadgerDK> once til you tough the ground again
[3:16:35] <+JohnXuandou> once you touch the ground you can super dash again it doesn't matter
[3:16:35] <%iwishthiswasicq> @AngriestPat If you land you can do it again.
[3:16:37] <%Trinity5> @nobknee as it should be
[3:16:39] <BadgerDK> touch
[3:16:39] <cedryk98> landing on the ground resets your super dash
[3:16:41] <%iwishthiswasicq> Also sentai kick is rad.
[3:16:42] <fmc009> @AngriestPat You can super dash once per landing on the ground
[3:16:42] <Zombrocom> If you touch the ground you can dash again
[3:16:43] <%CaptainPileDriver> yeah
[3:16:43] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> I love that Saiyaman color
[3:16:43] <Run44forrest> yeah but you hit the floor so you can super dash again
[3:16:46] <%TheStarbecue> Super dash resets when your feet hit the ground
[3:16:52] <Leud_De_Grace> Good level 3 videl
[3:16:57] <%CaptainPileDriver> @AngriestPat i'm coming for you with my ginyu level 3 again
[3:16:58] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> @TheShockVox REALLY?! Man, talk about bastardization. @BorinCorran 17 is a good boi and shooting her mid transformation may have been rude, but it was super deserved.
[3:17:00] <+badchoice5> Have you tried having the computer wail on your Broly over and over until he becomes immune to blows?
[3:17:00] <%ECRead> DR is once per combo, not SD
[3:17:04] <%Rhinoprotoss> Do pressure after level 3 hard knockdown
[3:17:05] <+ArcanumMBD> @AngriestPat with 16 in the air after you do combo you can throw in 2 specials and then 236M grab
[3:17:06] <%Kravedarknesss> videl should've learned ki
[3:17:07] <cedryk98> as well as double jump
[3:17:11] <%Trinity5> @AngriestPat sliding knockdown does not equal hard knockdown just fyi
[3:17:12] <%iwishthiswasicq> Man, Videl might actually get me back into this game.
[3:17:14] <tmix1600> As many as you can fit you only get one per combo usually
[3:17:15] <$MajorCrasher> @angriestpat just get Woolie to coach you Kappa
[3:17:20] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> haha hey remember the time videl got the shit beaten out of her haha that was kinda hot haha
[3:17:21] <+honorable_captain_garlock> it doesn't reset your smash attack I don't think at lleast
[3:17:22] <raveous> landing on the ground OR blocking restores your superdash
[3:17:25] <Xirn> so if after you dunk -> assist with 16, you can often super dash and get another few hits into the other airgrab
[3:17:26] <arkv01> I'll show you something fierce
[3:17:34] <Leud_De_Grace> Oh fuck guys, he has Yamcha
[3:17:34] <%MightyMaxT> The best PC mod is Short Hair Videl with Helmet Saiyaman. Along with normal hair Vegito
[3:17:44] <%Kravedarknesss> @desudesudokidoki please no
[3:17:45] <r_Foeburden87> Them Jiren colors
[3:17:46] <jusros1023> Which lobby?
[3:17:55] <cedryk98> instead of your 2nd dunk just super dash
[3:17:55] <Xirn> god this jiren colour is the best LUL
[3:17:56] <+BorinCorran> The best Mod is Marge Broly and don't pretend otherwise.
[3:17:57] <+QuadraticGravity> it's a DP
[3:18:01] <%Trinity5> is cooler's knee a dp assist?
[3:18:04] <+DK_Rance> clown jiren LUL
[3:18:06] <%Trinity5> can he call cooler after dunk?
[3:18:08] <%Trinity5> would that work?
[3:18:08] <%iwishthiswasicq> Man, Jiren's number is soooooo big.
[3:18:10] <TheShockVox> @sir_gawain_lotsson Nah to be fair, Toei did theirs first. The manga came out second. The manga benefits from seeing what the anime does right AND wrong and can change accordingly
[3:18:14] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> @Kravedarknesss ;3
[3:18:14] <Ion_LaserX> @jusros1023 4
[3:18:15] <gottigotbundles> east Canada 4 password 1115
[3:18:16] <+a_deadbeat> DP assists are kind of hard to use in pressure compared to other assists
[3:18:19] <aeonicvector> @BorinCorran SSBlue Kermit
[3:18:19] <fmc009> Nice of Pat doing first to 1 so everyone can play
[3:18:22] <+QuadraticGravity> Cooler was on cd
[3:18:23] <Xirn> if he superdashes after cooler assist I assume it would
[3:18:24] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@TheStarbecue) (warning)
[3:18:25] <Xirn> most do after SD
[3:18:26] <Twoiis> You used him as an assist.
[3:18:26] <+honorable_captain_garlock> you gotta hit forward too
[3:18:29] <+JohnXuandou> because you couldn't tag after the assist call Pat
[3:18:31] <%Trinity5> @AngriestPat trying to tag cooler while he wasn't ready
[3:18:32] <%Rhinoprotoss> You're not even holding the buttom
[3:18:33] <%babrukus> cooler was on CD because of assist
[3:18:34] <Twoiis> had cooldown on tag.
[3:18:35] <fmc009> He was on cooldown?
[3:18:36] <+blademaster247> You can't tag the character whose assist you just used
[3:18:43] <Zombrocom> On cooldown because you used him as an assist
[3:18:43] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> @TheShockVox That seems like it's the opposite of how the order usually goes but aight
[3:18:45] <Fujiwara_92> assist and tag have cooldowns
[3:18:48] <ScreamingMeat> Those colors on Jiran are AWEFUL
[3:18:49] <Xirn> when the portrait's greyed out you can't tag/call
[3:18:52] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Chat advice got Pat on tilt
[3:18:56] <%gessho> Watching people who aren't good at this game is amusing lol
[3:18:57] <tmix1600> Jesus Pat
[3:19:01] <NicholasKane> so what you do is, you either figure out one specific move that lets you follow up after cooler's assist, or, you never use cooler's assist to extend the combo and use broly's instead
[3:19:02] <raveous> you can't tag unless their character icon is NOT grayed out
[3:19:08] <%gessho> People just wanna have fun in the fight game
[3:19:20] <StarkMaximum> Fun?! Not on MY fucking watch
[3:19:22] <cedryk98> instead of that level 1 you could have called in broly
[3:19:26] <cedryk98> for an asiist
[3:19:27] <%CaptainPileDriver> good job
[3:19:27] <TheShockVox> @sir_gawain_lotsson It’s absolutely is, but that’s what happens when a manga comes out monthly instead of weekly. The anime was WAY ahead. Same for Boruto.
[3:19:27] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> "Play to learn, not to win" fuck that. Kick their asses, Pat! apatBig apatDab
[3:19:32] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> coolers abilities have coodowns LUL
[3:19:33] <%Trinity5> what's coolers slide knockdown, chat?
[3:19:34] <+Probliterator> Gotta master that cooldown between assists/tags
[3:19:36] <Pnutz409> duff
[3:19:42] <%TheStarbecue> coolerdowns
[3:19:43] <%CaptainPileDriver> you, did it
[3:19:49] <+Probliterator> That's why I ain't good at this game either
[3:19:51] <%CaptainPileDriver> lol
[3:19:52] <%gessho> @Trinity5 knee

[3:20:10] <%gessho> @Trinity5 qcb
[3:20:11] <Run44forrest> 500 IQ
[3:20:17] <tmix1600> If the character is grey you can only dhc into them, no assist no tag
[3:20:17] <%CaptainPileDriver> lol
[3:20:18] <%iwishthiswasicq> God, the more I see Jiren in motion, the worse he fucking gets.
[3:20:20] <%HyperCharge_Sam> IT'S FUCKING RAAAWWWWWWW
[3:20:22] <+honorable_captain_garlock> oh my gosh
[3:20:22] <jayteh3> When does the devil may cry demo launch?

[3:20:29] <+Grayhammatter> wow
[3:20:30] <exalt4747> Is Pat fightingPat?
[3:20:30] <TheShockVox> I NEED TO FIGHT PAT. I didn’t get a chance to fight him for third strike for the machinima episode or the SoulCal5 episode
[3:20:31] <Maddeax> whatta ya doin streamin Dragonball while max is, that's suicide
[3:20:32] <+honorable_captain_garlock> pop pat pop
[3:20:34] <+ArcanumMBD> How many Raw L3s will Pat eat in a single fight?
[3:20:36] <+Grayhammatter> that RAW

[3:20:37] <Fujiwara_92> I MEAN RAWS

[3:20:40] <Pnutz409> wow
[3:20:41] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> gg patty
[3:20:43] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Ok, that one was raw. The first one wasn't
[3:20:45] <King___Crimson> First time I've seen Jiren's level 3. It was just as boring as I expected
[3:20:46] <Josef_Stryker> At least Jiren has that nice Patrick Seitz voice now
[3:20:47] <%CaptainPileDriver> @AngriestPat it's not a waste to honestly pop sparking to save acharacter when someone does that
[3:20:50] <Leud_De_Grace> Rip jiren
[3:20:51] <+ahegotrigger> good job
[3:20:55] <%gessho> @Trinity5 knee ender for supers Light divekick ender for oki
[3:20:58] <+QuadraticGravity> @AngriestPat Here's a fun one for you. If you have them in the corner with Cooler, 5H can be followed up with a divekick to keep them on the floor for beating.
[3:20:58] <%aishman> @angriestpat GG man
[3:20:58] <+honorable_captain_garlock> dont be afraid to pop sparking to save a character who has a lot of blue life
[3:21:02] <+badchoice5> Pat's power right now is not Maximum
[3:21:05] <+GreatBrightBlack> Jiren is going in Coller's sex dungeon
[3:21:05] <%Trinity5> @gessho should tell pat that lmao
[3:21:06] <Josef_Stryker> What has Pat's W/L ratio been so far?
[3:21:06] <+Grayhammatter> leave jiren to broly i guess
[3:21:06] <%aishman> sorry if I wasn't a fun fight
[3:21:07] <+VektorTroika> leave Jiren to ooler
[3:21:10] <Leud_De_Grace> Also what does jiren say when he gets ko’d as the last man standing?
[3:21:15] <+ahegotrigger> Jiren losing to cooler is kinda funny to me honestly
[3:21:21] <T_Sasquatch> is jiren the worst designed character in dragon ball ever
[3:21:23] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> @VektorTroika is Ooler like, a fusion of Oolong and Cooler?
[3:21:28] <T_Sasquatch> yes , yes he is
[3:21:31] <%Big_Dream> Jiren has 100% to zero combo
[3:21:31] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> LUL
[3:21:32] <+Grayhammatter> F

[3:22:21] <%ECRead> @AngriestPat don't forget that sparking can be activated on block now
[3:22:21] <+ArcanumMBD> @AngriestPat Do Combo
[3:22:21] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> @AngriestPat You can never be too salty with fighting games
[3:22:22] <+a_deadbeat> I completely understand
[3:22:26] <raveous> oh shit, no mvc or any of that
[3:22:26] <%Rhinoprotoss> It's like fighting games are frustrating
[3:22:26] <cedryk98> learn the basics first
[3:22:27] <Kalcom> hwat

[3:22:29] <nina9669> your pretty salty
[3:22:32] <fmc009> @AngriestPat You ranaway from me xD
[3:22:32] <+VektorTroika> skullgrils?
[3:22:33] <+JohnXuandou> the thing is, there's not much actual general advice and a lot of the questions you're asking can't be explained generally
[3:22:34] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> Oh wow
[3:22:35] <r_Foeburden87> This team
[3:22:36] <%Kuro_Koshka> @AngriestPat You know Wooolie and NEVER played Marvel?
[3:22:36] <%bendatron> lies pat you played mahvel
[3:22:38] <%3xgilly> OMG DUDE
[3:22:39] <Fujiwara_92> just tag and do combo
[3:22:40] <%bigfado287> Skullgirls?
[3:22:41] <IOptimusGrimes> novriltataki has sick quick tutorials on this game
[3:22:41] <%Sulliman34> ok so: reflect is your best friend defensively. its like pushblock
[3:22:43] <+ArcanumMBD> Just do combo
[3:22:44] <%3xgilly> BUSS BRUH
[3:22:44] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> BUSSASS
[3:22:44] <StarkMaximum> @AngriestPat I don't think asking chat for general advice is the way to go, you're getting everytihng chaotic and messy. If you're looking for general advice why not hunt down some videos to watch?
[3:22:45] <+honorable_captain_garlock> o fuk u bout to get laid out
[3:22:47] <%Big_Dream> hmm me thinks this guy palys way too much
[3:22:47] <mikesapartment> Just try to do super strings to get used to doing it
[3:22:48] <aeonicvector> @AngriestPat nah i totally get it, its just a bit weird because your on weird characters and its case based
[3:22:48] <TheShockVox> I WAS SNAPCHATTING A GIRL! What was I thinking?!
[3:22:52] <+SoriduSnaku> this dude here to flex LUL
[3:22:54] <tmix1600> Your playing and trying to learn, its understandable
[3:22:54] <%Kravedarknesss> it looks like funimation Is replacing Vic in some of their dubs so we'll probably be getting a new voice actor for super broly
[3:22:55] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> y do u not like them?
[3:22:56] <%Sotetsu> They went in a whole new art direction with DMC5, huh?
[3:23:01] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> COMBO TIME
[3:23:02] <%CaptainPileDriver> @AngriestPat honestly, it depends on what you're running, like, cooler assist is generally good but broly's requires specific timing and circumstance
[3:23:03] <T_Sasquatch> fucking goku , vegeta and their baby
[3:23:05] <+ArcanumMBD> Pink square. RIP Pat
[3:23:07] <fmc009> Live stream footage of Pat running away from me Kappa

[3:23:16] <%Rhinoprotoss> Pat locked in his fighting game skill when he was still in colleg
[3:23:17] <raveous> can't call assists while blocking
[3:23:17] <%CaptainPileDriver> you're blocking and the game sometimes lags
[3:23:18] <%GlewmanIII> cant call assist if you're blocking
[3:23:18] <+ArcanumMBD> @AngriestPat Can't assist while in blockstun
[3:23:18] <%Trinity5> assist was on cooldown?
[3:23:18] <+blademaster247> You can't call assists when in blockstun
[3:23:21] <$TheCrispyBoi> it did
[3:23:22] <+honorable_captain_garlock> you cant use assist in blockstun
[3:23:28] <+a_deadbeat> you can't call assists for a certain amount of time after blocking

[3:23:36] <%Superstarsage> plus cooler was on cooldown if you were hitting him
[3:23:37] <+Mr_Kooly> @AngriestPat when you are hit while blocking there is a cooldown

[3:23:53] <%Trinity5> nice whiff punish
[3:23:55] <berasite> hope nothing explodes
[3:23:56] <son_lefty> while blocking you do forward plus assist call to get an assist put bit it requires 1 bar
[3:23:57] <%Trinity5> THERE WE GO
[3:23:58] <Pnutz409> Pat will figure it out
[3:23:58] <+blademaster247> Don't worry Pat, your still better at this game than DSP
[3:23:59] <%ECRead> you CAN sparking in blockstun though
[3:24:00] <%Trinity5> GOOD KNOCKDOWN
[3:24:01] <Brandon__Brando> im just like that I hate assists it adds a whole layer I dont want to think about

[3:25:07] <raveous> most lvl 1s are not invincible on startup, and they well spend a meter if you try and are interrupted
[3:25:08] <%CaptainPileDriver> @AngriestPat depending on the timing you can get hit out of supers, usually only if they are right ontop of you
[3:25:09] <%gessho> @cedryk98 level 3's aren't safe on block you crazy
[3:25:15] <TheShockVox> Anyone in the server who’s not in the room want to fight while we don’t get to fight Pat?

[3:25:38] <Kalcom> is this broly super
[3:25:39] <%Rhinoprotoss> Man puts in no work to learn fighting games, gets frustrated, and then wonders on the Podcast why fighting games aren't popular

[3:25:44] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> emlo
[3:25:45] <nobknee> @AngriestPat You should do GokuGokuGoku. I saw Woolie and his other people mess around with that, they can't handle it. Do GokuGokuGoku, and make Woolie touch his nose in defeat and shame.
[3:25:48] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> Super dashes are fun

[3:26:04] <%GlewmanIII> yeah
[3:26:04] <+a_deadbeat> Broly's level 3 can connect after his jumping neutral heavy, so you can keep the corner and still get almost full damage

[3:26:06] <raveous> Yes
[3:26:07] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> have emlo play

[3:26:53] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> ELMO GIVES YOU POWER
[3:27:03] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> awwwwww
[3:27:08] <%Trinity5> @gessho after the dunk, is that agood time to call cooler assist?
[3:27:08] <%CaptainPileDriver> @AngriestPat honestly, i know you love broly, but broly's assist is basically a zoning tool and isn't the best for combo's imo
[3:27:10] <+QuadraticGravity> @a_deadbeat hey what lobby is this in?
[3:27:14] <nobknee> Elmo do combo
[3:27:14] <ShichiNoBushi> Let Elmo play.

[3:27:42] <%Trinity5> @gessho okay yeah that's really good we should tell that to pat lmao
[3:27:45] <ShichiNoBushi> Use Elmo as an assist.
[3:27:45] <%TheStarbecue> i seent it
[3:27:45] <+ArcanumMBD> @AngriestPat with 16 in the corner you can do the full LMH, SS, 236M, instead of just LM
[3:27:52] <%CaptainPileDriver> @AngriestPat if someone whiffs a super, just vanish, it's safer and easier
[3:27:53] <%GingaNZ> cooldown
[3:27:55] <%gessho> @Trinity5 I already did
[3:27:55] <ScreamingMeat> Remember that Android 21 is 9 years old
[3:27:55] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> @FrostMass22() just rub it in why don't ya
[3:27:57] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Plague, help1 Android 21's voice is doing weird things to me
[3:28:00] <+honorable_captain_garlock> lol whyd he let you do that
[3:28:00] <Pnutz409> cooldown
[3:28:00] <%babrukus> cooldown pat
[3:28:01] <StarkMaximum> It was so nice of Pat's opponent to wait for him to figure out how to tag out
[3:28:02] <%ECRead> cooldown
[3:28:03] <%Trinity5> @gessho yeet
[3:28:04] <KeiPrime> they were on cooldown
[3:28:05] <%GlewmanIII> cooldown off assist
[3:28:06] <KeiPrime> the big red x's
[3:28:08] <nobknee> Does Android 21 appear in the shows at all, or only game?
[3:28:08] <%skizzuto> there's a cooldown on swapping characters after they snapback you
[3:28:09] <crazydiamond_fgc> If you get switched out there is an 8 second cooldown
[3:28:10] <+Eclipse_knight_> thats a smexy lookin 21
[3:28:13] <%Trinity5> @nobknee only game
[3:28:16] <Naho_Saenoki> @nobknee Game only.
[3:28:24] <+WayneTheNerd> Emo want up
[3:28:24] <%FrostMass22> @youwereeatenbyalid It hurts me too, I tried Apex and I just can't get into it.
[3:28:25] <%Trinity5> for after match? yeah
[3:28:25] <+Mr_Kooly> @AngriestPat when you are snapped back in there is a bigger cooldown for assists doing anything
[3:28:30] <%Rhinoprotoss> No
[3:28:31] <nobknee> Is she the only game-specific character?
[3:28:31] <%ECRead> sure
[3:28:31] <ScreamingMeat> She's 9
[3:28:34] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> NICE vanish
[3:28:35] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> Eh
[3:28:39] <cedryk98> what time does anyone have after the match? Like 8 seconds?
[3:28:41] <+badchoice5> Quick dodge that punch! Super, SUPER!
[3:28:44] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> 21 is a mother
[3:28:49] <Pnutz409> There is a bar around the assist that is cooling down. Once it fills back up, you can use again.
[3:28:52] <%xGreenflame> teacherCpunch
[3:28:53] <+Eclipse_knight_> shes made from a mom
[3:28:54] <StarkMaximum> yeah after the match he tends to see one or two comments out of like, 12
[3:28:55] <Naho_Saenoki> @nobknee Yes.
[3:28:56] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> it's just 9 years since she became a cyborg buu cell thing
[3:28:58] <KeiPrime> awoooooooo
[3:29:02] <nobknee> That's an odd one.
[3:29:11] <%gessho> It's adorable how pat takes his hands off the stick when he starts getting hit or dies
[3:29:12] <King___Crimson> @ScreamingMeat Nice
[3:29:12] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> ???
[3:29:12] <fmc009> @AngriestPat Remember Cooler has a invincible DP, the M and H DPs
[3:29:13] <ScreamingMeat> She's based on the mother of the man 16 is based on
[3:29:16] <+Papafleish> use focus attack
[3:29:21] <stabbityrabbit> I'mma say something controversial: MvCI had better gameplay than this. Anybody agree with me?
[3:29:24] <OToole42> the yamcha runback
[3:29:29] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> Why the raw supers when he was on block?
[3:29:34] <%Trinity5> @AngriestPat try calling cooler dp assist after you dunk with android 16, it should extend the combo if I understand it correctly
[3:29:34] <+a_deadbeat> You can't tag for a little while after getting hit even if your assists are off cooldown, just fyi
[3:29:35] <+ArcanumMBD> @AngriestPat Currently your air combo is just Light Medium, Special punches, Grab. But in the corner you can do Light Medium Heavy, Special punches, Grab, because they don't get knocked away
[3:29:36] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@NicholasKane) (warning)
[3:29:36] <+honorable_captain_garlock> "ArcanumMBD: @AngriestPat with 16 in the corner you can do the full LMH, SS, 236M, instead of just LM"
[3:29:36] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> @AngriestPat Is there a way to play different stages? Like a randomize button?
[3:29:37] <cedryk98> ya y he dit it!
[3:29:38] <nobknee> @stabbityrabbit You are right, that is a spicy opinion.
[3:29:38] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> cooler is so COOL
[3:29:38] <Pnutz409> the conversion!

[3:30:10] <%CaptainPileDriver> @AngriestPat i know you love broly, but you may wanna put him on point cause his assist is honestly for zoning and clipping someone when they whiff something
[3:30:12] <crazydiamond_fgc> Cooler's Medium DP is invincible. @Rhinoprotoss
[3:30:12] <StarkMaximum> Elmo has HAD ENOUGH

[3:32:35] <%TheStarbecue> jeez guys
[3:32:35] <+honorable_captain_garlock> SCRUBS!
[3:32:35] <%gessho> Losing in any fighting game is frustrating
[3:32:37] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> It's fusstrating playing Sub Zero
[3:32:38] <Run44forrest> paiges blindness is spreading
[3:32:39] <%3xgilly> arenas are weird in this game
[3:32:43] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@TheShockVox) (warning)
[3:32:44] <+mmSoTasty> I never get past that feeling LUL
[3:32:46] <%3xgilly> or ring matches rather
[3:32:46] <+badchoice5> You should try do combo
[3:32:55] <fmc009> @AngriestPat We all scrubs man the point is to strive out of of being bad
[3:32:57] <Run44forrest> oof
[3:32:59] <cedryk98> believe there are people ALOT worse than you
[3:33:02] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> Fighting games make my stupid become the apatBig stupid
[3:33:02] <FstSergeant8595> Always bet DBZ
[3:33:03] <duneblythe> You sure say "I don't understand " a lot
[3:33:05] <Pnutz409> predictabow!?
[3:33:08] <TheShockVox> Moo, you don’t understand the pain I feel
[3:33:11] <+ArcanumMBD> I've been working my way up the ladder and that stupid feeling NEVER GOES AWAY. There are always better players with better tech and boy do you feel dumb and bad often
[3:33:16] <TheShockVox> You’re just a machine
[3:33:16] <kazic5000> I like the music.
[3:33:16] <+Grayhammatter> predictabo
[3:33:24] <fmc009> @FstSergeant8595 The amount of bets lost in Salty Bet
[3:33:28] <Run44forrest> why
[3:33:32] <NickCaesar7> @angriestpat i always feel stupid when I try to learn to play a fighting game
[3:33:33] <%CaptainPileDriver> @AngriestPat on this guy, honestly, just do 16's heavy attacks cause he'll probably just get hit by them every time
[3:33:34] <+DestroyerPhoenix> man jiren must hate being in fighterz and being able to get bodied by mere earthlings 4Head
[3:33:34] <+JohnMarkley> good evening everyone :)
[3:33:36] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> I thought "I don't understand" was Paige's catchphrase
[3:33:36] <cedryk98> like this guy you're facing
[3:33:37] <Mr_pwng3> @angriestpat its that sorta frustration that led me to getting more into fighting games and eventually ss3 in this game
[3:33:44] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I don't even feel stupid. it's just "oh i got hit by a launcher, i'm dead from full health now. Guess I'll just sit here and watch myself die"
[3:33:44] <%GeckoLeo> I don't think I have the mental fortitude to be good at fighting games.
[3:33:46] <Pnutz409> JIren's dry af.
[3:33:52] <NicholasKane> @AngriestPat good matches, ill back out for now, gotta grind out that kh3 100%
[3:33:56] <Mr_pwng3> great first one to get into i think
[3:33:56] <+Promessa_EX> i'm playing ac7 right now and some of the music sounds the same
[3:33:57] <+miguelrod777> aaaugh
[3:34:02] <FstSergeant8595> @fmc009 DBZ in Salty Bet is a 50/50 shot honestly
[3:34:04] <limeyprick> bardock's cool
[3:34:04] <%GeckoLeo> @JohnMarkley Evening! fragHand
[3:34:06] <nobknee> Krillin can kick Jiren's butt. FighterZ is the real canon.
[3:34:18] <%GingaNZ> good shit with the more 2H
[3:34:24] <+a_deadbeat> yeah, after that chokeslam, do light command grab, then vanish
[3:34:27] <%afronooch> that AC5 soundtrack tho woolieMIRIN
[3:34:32] <StarkMaximum> @nobknee Krillin throws a rock at Jiren, what's that bug-eyed bastard gonna do? Unstoppable.
[3:34:36] <+a_deadbeat> you can run up and continue the combo
[3:34:38] <ptmpopulatethemoon> i straight up thought cooler was debora for a second
[3:34:39] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> are you trippin
[3:34:41] <+VektorTroika> are you trippin?
[3:34:43] <+JohnMarkley> hey @GeckoLeo :) /
[3:34:45] <ScreamingMeat> Love hoe Vegeto talks shit even when he's getting his teeth kicked in
[3:34:46] <+DK_Rance> are you trippin?
[3:34:50] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> brolly is bowser
[3:34:52] <nobknee> How can Jiren defeat a man who cannot smell him?
[3:34:56] <Brandon__Brando> @geckoleo you can get use to it once you learn the movements qnd what they doit its not so hard to figure out what to do
[3:34:58] <fmc009> @AngriestPat Your grab game was always a forte. Why not more grabs mid pressure with Broly?
[3:35:01] <+Promessa_EX> oh i meant to say a lot of the ac7 music sounds the same as fighterz
[3:35:12] <%GingaNZ> press M after your divekicks for a nice tail to the face meaty
[3:35:15] <cedryk98> worst possible bardock
[3:35:16] <%ssjklyco> They should add 18 yr old ChiChi, but have Goku be her assist much like Saiyaman and Videl. Making him a 4th or 5th goku by default
[3:35:18] <StarkMaximum> bardock more like smelly man
[3:35:19] <%Trinity5> @Promessa_EX this song especially
[3:35:30] <%Trinity5> bardock more like one of the longest level 3's in teh game lmao
[3:35:30] <+Promessa_EX> @Trinity5 exactly
[3:35:34] <%CaptainPileDriver> @AngriestPat that medium grab broly does, in the corner, can combo and go into super if need be
[3:35:43] <ptmpopulatethemoon> is that thing still in here where is broly misses the first hit of the auto combo it fucks with the scaling?
[3:35:44] <Jackedalot123> I don’t think people are even leaving the ring after a match anymore
[3:35:46] <spire6> Bustin, Bustin, Bustin, Bustin, Bustin, Bustin makes me FEEL GOOD (inc.)
[3:35:47] <Run44forrest> bardock canonically very smelly
[3:35:49] <+honorable_captain_garlock> you just gotta mix it in
[3:35:51] <%Trinity5> @AngriestPat if you can get comfortable with reflect it would be a huge boon to your defense
[3:35:53] <%CaptainPileDriver> @AngriestPat you'd be surprised
[3:35:54] <+honorable_captain_garlock> they cant exppect it
[3:35:54] <%jusros23> damn I suck
[3:35:56] <%jusros23> lol
[3:35:58] <%bevyrage> pressure doesn't require the grabs to hit
[3:36:00] <%jusros23> that was me
[3:36:02] <+a_deadbeat> If you want, I can talk to you more about all three of your characters after this stream
[3:36:10] <%bevyrage> pressure is part of the mind game
[3:36:12] <%GingaNZ> I think LLL works
[3:36:15] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> @spire6 what about the wicki wicki wow wow wow west, desperado
[3:36:15] <+a_deadbeat> I've played all of them, but I'm definitely a Broly main
[3:36:16] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> b r o l l y b o i
[3:36:18] <+ArcanumMBD> I think they said vansih after the choke?
[3:36:19] <crazydiamond_fgc> You can do his air throw after the chokeslam.
[3:36:24] <%brackboi> CHALLANGE MAX/FIGHT MAX
[3:36:24] <Mr_pwng3> could try throw more when you have them in the corner and your string is Done
[3:36:25] <+ArcanumMBD> i could be wrong
[3:36:26] <%bevyrage> let them know you can grab
[3:36:29] <%bevyrage> make 'em scurred
[3:36:33] <+a_deadbeat> air throw after the chokeslam, then vanish
[3:36:33] <FstSergeant8595> @Brandon__Brando You must be my doppelganger we have the same name and nickname
[3:36:36] <+grutamesh> ALL BIG CHARACTERS doodScrub
[3:36:39] <%3xgilly> just an idea but you could enter a combo is a ki attack hits then vanish
[3:36:40] <TheShockVox> “I’ve gotta get IN THERE!” -Yami Yugi
[3:36:41] <%jusros23> gg pat
[3:36:41] <%Kravedarknesss> why are 2/3 of the lady characters in fighterz built around having an assist
[3:36:44] <+a_deadbeat> light air throw specifically
[3:36:50] <%GeckoLeo> @Brandon__Brando Is this a good game to start on? I don't have any experience with traditional fighting games, just platforms like smash.
[3:36:55] <%3xgilly> idk
[3:36:57] <cedryk98> cover your throw with an assist
[3:37:00] <%GlewmanIII> people be mashing online
[3:37:01] <spire6> @Sir_Gawain_Lotsson I know that Loveless lost his damn mind in the Wicky Wicky Wild West
[3:37:03] <Run44forrest> try and do instant air dash heavies instead of just jump in medium
[3:37:07] <%jusros23> apatDab apatDab apatDab apatDab
[3:37:08] <Pnutz409> Pat with the footsies!
[3:37:09] <%GingaNZ> yeah thats plus
[3:37:14] <+a_deadbeat> Broly's grab has a hit of armor, so if you time it right, they usually can't get two hits out
[3:37:17] <NicholasKane> if a jab comes out, it's because they're mashing. consider trying to learn some form of frametrap
[3:37:19] <%Trinity5> i'm a fan of jiren's side switch on the 2H, honestly
[3:37:32] <+ArcanumMBD> @AngriestPat you can use an assist to bait them into keeping their guard, then grab. But if your assist hits before the grab, your grab will whiff
[3:37:35] <+a_deadbeat> good switch btw
[3:37:39] <fruit_pie_the_magician> If you're going by the show, everything jiren has should be plus
[3:37:41] <StarkMaximum> @GeckoLeo It's really hard to say what fighting games are good for a beginner but honestly I think this one would be a nice starting point, especially if you're a fan of Dragon Ball (tho when I started playing I didn't like Dragon Ball at all and now after playing it I'm a huge nut about it)
[3:37:42] <fmc009> Good sequence and with the dhc to save blue health
[3:37:42] <gottigotbundles> the honor system is failing
[3:37:49] <%Trinity5> lmfao
[3:37:56] <+ArcanumMBD> GET MORE EYES PAT

[3:37:59] <%Trinity5> WHIFFS FOR DAYS
[3:38:00] <%BestTeaMaker> everyone give more advice now and none later
[3:38:03] <arkv01> don't listen to pay, SCREAM ADVICE LOUDER
[3:38:04] <%Tredecian> just pause the game
[3:38:05] <StarkMaximum> Pat why not take longer breaks in between matches to read more advice?
[3:38:07] <hntronium> TWO SETS OF EYES
[3:38:09] <eco419> Win
[3:38:10] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> hey pat. you're doing great.
[3:38:10] <%AncelDeLambert> grab that advice titty, Pat!
[3:38:13] <%bbomi1995> use your six sets of eyes
[3:38:13] <Run44forrest> lmaoo the little look over
[3:38:16] <StarkMaximum> You get out of a match and then eight seconds later the next match loads
[3:38:16] <%GeckoLeo> @StarkMaximum That's what I was thinking. I've never really watched DB but it looks super interesting.
[3:38:16] <arkv01> FOUR SETS if you put on sunglasses!
[3:38:17] <fmc009> That... should've combo'ed
[3:38:23] <%Trinity5> @AngriestPat keep it up you're doing well
[3:38:23] <King___Crimson> PAT BELIEVE IN YOURSELF

[3:38:58] <fmc009> Annotations mid match LUL
[3:39:06] <StarkMaximum> @GeckoLeo I'm a simple guy, I like big dumb fights where people yell about how powerful their opponent is but the hero wins because they believe in their friends
[3:39:07] <%3xgilly> do big buttons
[3:39:09] <%ssjklyco> With your 3rd eye
[3:39:10] <+badchoice5> Just spin the sticks Pat, just keep spinning the sticks
[3:39:12] <+Grayhammatter> with your lazy eye pat
[3:39:12] <+DK_Rance> just look at it LUL
[3:39:13] <arkv01> duh, ULTRA INSTINCT pat
[3:39:13] <ebonifragaria> Hook chat directly to your brain. It's not like you can get any crazier
[3:39:17] <raveous> just scroll up after the match, ezpz
[3:39:20] <%Prism_Wing> @theshockvox When's the first date?
[3:39:22] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> @Run44forrest yes
[3:39:33] <arkv01> all these killers on dbfz can ultra instinct in real life
[3:39:33] <%GeckoLeo> @StarkMaximum Hell yeah! I can appreciate that. Been meaning to watch DB anyway.
[3:39:45] <fmc009> I forgot Tien had a grab
[3:39:46] <%GingaNZ> gp to training mod for a bit to learn some stuff while not fighting
[3:39:47] <%Trinity5> @AngriestPat it's not a bad idea if the opponent has sparking activated to just wait it out and not go in on them
[3:39:48] <+ArcanumMBD> @AngriestPat you can use assist to bait them in keeping their block while you use a grab. But if your assist hits before the grab, your grab will whiff since you can't grab while they're in blockstun
[3:39:50] <+BrendorTheEndor> @AngriestPat there's a google doc out there with optimal combos in most situations for all characters if you want it, it's super useful
[3:39:51] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> @AngriestPat pat you smell
[3:39:51] <firesonicz> Command grabs don't work against players that can't be conditioned to not press buttons
[3:39:54] <cedryk98> the bounce on vanish only occurs if they are in hitstun
[3:39:54] <+honorable_captain_garlock> You can cover a throw with an assist just make sure it hits AFTER the block stun or else it will miss. if you think they will jab when you let up pressure delay your block strings a little bit and you can catch them if you have faster startup, like a lot of 2l's.
[3:39:59] <%Flambage> You got TWO eyes Pat! obviously just look at both at the same time @AngriestPat
[3:40:00] <%ECRead> @AngriestPat after Broly chokeslam, you can Cooler assist when you nearly hit the ground, 214SH, then DR, 236L, and then lvl 1
[3:40:04] <StarkMaximum> @BrendorTheEndor Can you link that shit
[3:40:07] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> !uptime
[3:40:07] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 40m.
[3:40:14] <%korth367> @AngriestPat you can tech a throw by dropping darknight for warrior
[3:40:19] <%Trinity5> @korth367 nice

[3:40:45] <+badchoice5> The secret is to NEVER stop pressing buttons
[3:40:45] <stabbityrabbit> @AngriestPat Why not take a little bit longer between matches to read what chat says? Could help.
[3:40:45] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> but you're not playing smash
[3:40:46] <ebonifragaria> pat smells only of lemons
[3:40:51] <TheShockVox> @prism_wing As soon as I get in that ROOM! I missed out on playing him in SF3TS and SC5. I won’t miss this chance. I have work,in the morning and my basement flooded with shit today. I need to fight this man.
[3:40:52] <nobknee> I can smell your thumb on your nose.

[3:40:58] <fmc009> dragon rush
[3:41:00] <Mr_pwng3> be careful when they spark to keep blocking, because they'll jab twice while falling then can still continue soon as they touch the ground @angriestpat

[3:42:15] <Run44forrest> i feel like this game was made for regular controllers
[3:42:18] <StarkMaximum> i didn't feel--i didn't feel th--i didn't fe--i did--i
[3:42:22] <%Rhinoprotoss> The lack of pressure Pat puts on after sliding knockdown...
[3:42:25] <+Grayhammatter> what does pot of greed do?
[3:42:26] <%afronooch> ididntfeelthaididntfeididntfeelthat
[3:42:27] <%Trinity5> @Woozie56k i agree but everyone uses it sajamStare
[3:42:28] <%Prism_Wing> 2468 who do we appreciate?
[3:42:32] <fmc009> @AngriestPat try to remember Videl has an overhead in her rekka
[3:42:34] <ptmpopulatethemoon> i think broly didnt feel that
[3:42:43] <%CaptainPileDriver> someone can join lobby
[3:42:44] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Man, those Videl colors makes it look like she's only wearing a t shirt monkaS
[3:42:45] <ptmpopulatethemoon> but im not sure
[3:42:46] <KeiPrime> modern fighting games are designed with controllers in mind
[3:42:46] <%CaptainPileDriver> nvm
[3:42:47] <+ArcanumMBD> @Grayhammatter pot of green allows me to draw TWO EXTRA CARDS
[3:42:53] <KeiPrime> 1000%
[3:42:53] <deviljhojho94> hot
[3:42:54] <+ArcanumMBD> greed* fuck
[3:43:09] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> @GeckoLeo T-that card!? It allows you to draw two additional cards from your deck into your hand!!
[3:43:09] <%Rhinoprotoss> pot of pot
[3:43:11] <Worldbrand> pot of green allows you to get so fucking blazed
[3:43:11] <%CaptainPileDriver> omg
[3:43:12] <%Trinity5> OH SHIT
[3:43:12] <%Kirijuo> I don’t even understand what any of these numbers or letters mean pvpSK
[3:43:14] <fmc009> THE READ
[3:43:17] <egggggggggggggggggggggg> @angriestpat Videls 6H is not a true block string. you can reflect or guard cancel before she goes into her rekka
[3:43:19] <%CaptainPileDriver> he actually went for a jab
[3:43:25] <KeiPrime> but its just a matter of preference really, like i use my stick for tekken sf, dbfz, but i use a controller for soulcalibur
[3:43:27] <Worldbrand> @Kirijuo look at your numpad
[3:43:30] <%CaptainPileDriver> ded cooler
[3:43:37] <Kyle4sod> poopin in quick I'm at work was the dmc5 demo the same demo
[3:43:37] <Leud_De_Grace> You dont touch Cooler like that, Vegeta
[3:43:40] <exalt4747> I couldn't stand numpad at first but now that I know it, it's way more efficient
[3:43:43] <%Trinity5> NICE
[3:43:50] <%CaptainPileDriver> nvm
[3:43:52] <Run44forrest> nice
[3:43:55] <fmc009> THE GRAB
[3:43:56] <+ArcanumMBD> @Kirijuo look at your numpad. Imagine a stick at 5. The numbers are directions. Letters are the attack button. Light, Medium, Heavy, Special
[3:43:57] <%Iplatypusprime> naicu
[3:43:59] <KeiPrime> noice
[3:44:02] <deviljhojho94> graboid
[3:44:02] <OToole42> that was filthy
[3:44:08] <StarkMaximum> I feel liek the key to understanding numpad notation is just remembering that 5 is neutral and 2 is down
[3:44:09] <deviljhojho94> also fuck moobot
[3:44:09] <%CaptainPileDriver> yeeeep
[3:44:14] <%CaptainPileDriver> raw level
[3:44:14] <%GeckoLeo> @DesuDesuDokiDoki Yes! Which will allow me to play the magic card, Pot of Greed!
[3:44:14] <%Rhinoprotoss> Vore me
[3:44:15] <Leud_De_Grace> I first learned about the num pad directional inputs from Blazblue
[3:44:15] <+honorable_captain_garlock> big oof
[3:44:16] <deviljhojho94> hpt
[3:44:17] <%CaptainPileDriver> or that
[3:44:20] <+BrendorTheEndor> @AngriestPat there's a google doc out there with optimal combos in most situations for all characters if you want it, it's super useful
[3:44:22] <IminyourBase> VORE
[3:44:23] <+honorable_captain_garlock> You might wanna try and use that vanish combo to snap in lower health enemies/ take away there blue health it makes a big difference.
[3:44:23] <fmc009> LEVEL 1 HAS ARMOR???????
[3:44:23] <+a_deadbeat> You have a pretty good amount of time to DHC, so you can visually confirm if you need to do another super to kill someone
[3:44:23] <Run44forrest> reflect pat NotLikeThis
[3:44:24] <+badchoice5> Crush dat puss
[3:44:25] <Mr_pwng3> nice
[3:44:26] <%Kirijuo> Holy shit that actually makes sense pvpFATTERZ
[3:44:27] <firesonicz> Pat if you want to do cooler's divekick after air 2S, use the ex version
[3:44:28] <deviljhojho94> vore lords
[3:44:32] <Justinbattleborn> yues
[3:44:39] <Zombrocom> Literally everything but brolys lights have armour its nuts
[3:44:40] <nobknee> do combo
[3:44:41] <%ECRead> @AngriestPat 214SH with Broly is an alt version of his lvl 3 that is a delayed hit (which is why you use Cooler to pop them up into the hit). this version lets you continue comboing while the super is still active (hence why you can catch them with Dragon Rush)
[3:44:46] <%GingaNZ> go to training more for a bit
[3:44:46] <+BrendorTheEndor> they're really easy bnb's as well
[3:44:48] <%Trinity5> @AngriestPat want some bread and butters in the discord?
[3:44:55] <deviljhojho94> use your big boy words patricio
[3:44:57] <%nmaten> learn stuff off of stray hits
[3:44:57] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> @GeckoLeo T-that card!? It allows you to draw two additional cards from your deck and place them into your hand!!
[3:45:03] <+honorable_captain_garlock> EL HERMANO
[3:45:04] <%GingaNZ> learn something then come back fresh
[3:45:05] <+BrendorTheEndor> im a turbo scrub and i use it, id highly recommend personally
[3:45:05] <raveous> you just need your BnB
[3:45:08] <T_Sasquatch> I still prefer just saying d, df , uf etc
[3:45:13] <+badchoice5> The trick is to keep your assist alive
[3:45:14] <%Trinity5> i mean you don't need assist combos, they just help
[3:45:15] <%nmaten> thats what lab is for
[3:45:16] <%Rhinoprotoss> But why'd you put Android 16 first then
[3:45:19] <StarkMaximum> That's why your assist is put later in the lineup so they're in danger less
[3:45:21] <%nmaten> find more combo to do
[3:45:22] <IOptimusGrimes> should do arena mode so you can read info in chat in between matches
[3:45:22] <KeiPrime> thats kinda the game tho, isnt it?
[3:45:22] <+ArcanumMBD> @AngriestPat just be a scrub like me who doesn't use assists in big combos
[3:45:30] <Woozie56k> play how you want, man. don't worry about optimisation if you don't want to do it, @AngriestPat !!
[3:45:39] <IOptimusGrimes> or add more time on the auto out in ring matches
[3:45:51] <%Iplatypusprime> those colors on jiren hurt my eyes
[3:45:56] <gottigotbundles> the last 3 people stayed in I'm telling mom
[3:45:57] <%bigfado287> The same people seem to keep showing up
[3:46:01] <+a_deadbeat> this is the best Jiren color
[3:46:03] <%afronooch> yeah
[3:46:07] <Leud_De_Grace> Jiren has weird taste in palette colors
[3:46:13] <KeiPrime> these fucking colors
[3:46:17] <%Iplatypusprime> apatWrong
[3:46:18] <ebonifragaria> Those pants are aggressively pink
[3:46:40] <+FierceDeityGabriel> Because he's el payaso
[3:46:47] <%Rhinoprotoss> Have a training stream with Woolie tho
[3:46:53] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@CaptainPileDriver) (warning)
[3:46:56] <nobknee> do big combo
[3:46:57] <StarkMaximum> @Leud_De_Grace I like to imagine Jiren showed up for color palette asignments and he was like "I don't care about colors I only care about strength" and they were like "does that mean we can just give you whatever colors we want" and he was like "sure" and smash cut to that monstrosity
[3:46:57] <Pnutz409> Jiren aka wedding photographer
[3:46:57] <egggggggggggggggggggggg> His name is literally "The Clown" Lul
[3:47:01] <%GeckoLeo> How else are you supposed to dab on the haters without eye melting color palettes?
[3:47:06] <+rooked4> Are you tripping!?
[3:47:08] <%GingaNZ> character specific
[3:47:09] <%GeckoLeo> apatDab
[3:47:12] <+BrendorTheEndor> depends on the way the combo started
[3:47:16] <raveous> Jiren looking like he's ready for the olympics vaulting
[3:47:18] <+honorable_captain_garlock> it depend on whether or not they already spent there smash attack
[3:47:21] <%CaptainPileDriver> @AngriestPat it depends on if you're holding a direction or in neutral
[3:47:21] <Leud_De_Grace> Lol, I can see that happening Stark
[3:47:23] <+QuadraticGravity> NASTY cross up
[3:47:28] <Leud_De_Grace> Thanks for the laugh 🤣
[3:47:31] <+Dovakhin573> if the combo starts with down H or dragon rush it leads into hard knockdown
[3:47:32] <Justinbattleborn> nice cross up
[3:47:36] <fmc009> @AngriestPat 2H makes H in the air cause a sliding knockdown, that can be used to combo into a super
[3:47:50] <Zombrocom> @AngriestPat IN GENERAL, air heavys cause the slide after either a 2h or an air 2h in a combo, charater specific
[3:47:55] <StarkMaximum> Did Gotenks literally just say "I'm getting juicy" and how do I unhear those words
[3:47:58] <mistersups> Smash attacks are the combo extensions. If you use a smash, it will become a sliding knockdown.
[3:48:03] <%Iplatypusprime> how are the new characters? they look cool
[3:48:10] <Zombrocom> @AngriestPat Literally none of the characters you play behave this way
[3:48:12] <%CaptainPileDriver> pat, gotenks is bs
[3:48:17] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> pat u gotta smash
[3:48:20] <gottigotbundles> dizzy*
[3:48:23] <+honorable_captain_garlock> soup or donut?
[3:48:30] <%Rhinoprotoss> Yes
[3:48:32] <fmc009> I think Cooler does? not sure
[3:48:37] <KeiPrime> cause you pick big duders
[3:48:39] <Makaru225> funny how Tiny Dwarf Prince Pat's team consists of Nothing but the Tallest, most mountainous behemoths
[3:48:42] <Mr_pwng3> @angriestpat 16 sucks without assists but people like hit or Goku can still rock somebody with the mix-ups on how many different combos and moves they have
[3:48:45] <nobknee> @StarkMaximum Get juiced boys.
[3:48:49] <%ECRead> @AngriestPat i hope i've at least been some help. i gotta get up at 5:30 so I'm out. later guys apatDab
[3:48:52] <+honorable_captain_garlock> nop
[3:48:55] <KeiPrime> i guess not?
[3:48:58] <%Iplatypusprime> apatDab apatMenace apatDab
[3:48:59] <Worldbrand> peace
[3:49:02] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> poop
[3:49:02] <StarkMaximum> @Makaru225 We play video games to engage in fantastical situations we could never recreate in real life
[3:49:04] <%Rhinoprotoss> 16 is decent as an anchor
[3:49:06] <%CaptainPileDriver> okay
[3:49:12] <fmc009> FINALLY MY TIME

[3:49:49] <arkv01> @a_deadbeat give pay a dbfz handjob and you're in
[3:49:49] <KeiPrime> i mean hes doin shit, but fuck
[3:49:49] <%CaptainPileDriver> oh, basic bnb's, you got a lot of them down
[3:49:50] <KiraKamixephos> Do the ghost ahki pat
[3:49:51] <%Rhinoprotoss> lul
[3:49:54] <Mr_pwng3> hold back, tap special, then throw
[3:49:57] <%grimpo96> Y O U C A N D O I T
[3:49:59] <%ECRead> I got you, Pat doodGood
[3:50:02] <+QuadraticGravity> hmm
[3:50:05] <nobknee> Nah, but seriously, I'm just bullshittin' in chat. I don't know anything about fightin' games.
[3:50:11] <%dking0000> I hope Super Broly plays really different to not make OG Broly irrelevant
[3:50:16] <%babrukus> apatRaffle
[3:50:17] <KeiPrime> theres just so many variables in a game like this
[3:50:22] <+a_deadbeat> @arkv01 poor college student no money :(
[3:50:31] <Pnutz409> gang signs
[3:50:58] <Mr_pwng3> MY BOY DOING IT
[3:51:00] <arkv01> @a_deadbeat doesn't cost anything to guide his controller while jacking him off ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
[3:51:03] <nobknee> When is Mr. Popo gonna step into the ring?
[3:51:11] <%Xooler67> how do you even get a hit in?
[3:51:11] <ebonifragaria> @nobknee Same here. I don't even know enough to properly shitpost
[3:51:15] <%babrukus> I love trunks
[3:51:16] <+a_deadbeat> oh my
[3:51:22] <KeiPrime> i dont like fighting trunks
[3:51:33] <nobknee> I know, they can be hard to get on.
[3:51:36] <%jusros23> Patrick only plays big bois
[3:51:36] <Futurecity10> Welp, Sam Lloyd's about to die
[3:51:37] <KeiPrime> idk why that guy blew me up all the damn time
[3:51:52] <+honorable_captain_garlock> no
[3:51:54] <%CaptainPileDriver> @AngriestPat you are picking bad times to reflect
[3:51:54] <+QuadraticGravity> @AngriestPat Broly has a projectile blocking shield with D,D,Special
[3:51:56] <%babrukus> Such power! you'll need more!
[3:51:56] <oldmemesdiehard> Jesus
[3:51:56] <duneblythe> omg I just tried to pause to go to the bathroom
[3:51:57] <chester804> take that princes trunks
[3:51:58] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Pat, your problem is that you are playing this game out of an enjoyment for the characters and enjoyment of the mechanics rather than a desire to exploit the meta. Vegeta for example is primarily used because he has an OP assist.
[3:52:00] <%GeckoLeo> @ebonifragaria Shit shit-posting is the best kind of shitposting.
[3:52:04] <%CaptainPileDriver> cause people are fishing for you to do it
[3:52:08] <DavidSanChan> just like in the old broly movies
[3:52:11] <%Appleauce101> wait there is a sub discord
[3:52:12] <+a_deadbeat> the projectile blocking shield is qcb special
[3:52:13] <deviljhojho94> man trunks you suck
[3:52:16] <+BrendorTheEndor> @AngriestPat every time you're in a combo, hold any attack button and a direction, it'll guarantee you pop out if the combo isnt true
[3:52:20] <VVerewolfJones> "I'm picking Bab."
[3:52:23] <+FrostedZaibatsu> @fruit_pie_the_magician ban youre self
[3:52:24] <nobknee> Wow, thanks for lettin' me know Scrubs actor is about to die.
[3:52:26] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> u gat a participation medal patt ;)
[3:52:29] <+honorable_captain_garlock> its not that great anymore actually
[3:52:30] <fmc009> @AngriestPat ggs man
[3:52:31] <%Appleauce101> been subbed for 2 months how do i not know this
[3:52:32] <%CaptainPileDriver> on vegeta assist, honestly, just D.R. through it cause it's safe to do now
[3:52:33] <nobknee> One of the few actors I enjoyed on that show.
[3:52:37] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> @Appleauce101 sure is, go check servers you've been invited to
[3:52:41] <%babrukus> BE NICE TO 16
[3:52:45] <KeiPrime> well vegeta assist is not as good anymore
[3:52:49] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> fun > all
[3:52:50] <Mr_pwng3> youre doing the reflects well, just gotta keep doing them for the main guys attacks rather then his assists
[3:52:51] <%Rhinoprotoss> Your team choice has nothing to do with it. It's your ordering
[3:52:53] <%TheStarbecue> Defense is weird cuz its really just about learning when you can do video game
[3:52:54] <Idon__> no bully the android
[3:52:55] <%babrukus> He didn't choose to look like an idiot.
[3:52:55] <%nmaten> vegeta is too small for pat to play
[3:52:57] <ACuddleyTeddy> Playing a game to have fun? What is that like?
[3:52:57] <1stpigeon2scuba> How come insta thots don't message me back
[3:52:57] <+phatmac16> Fuck you
[3:52:59] <%babrukus> no bully
[3:53:00] <%CaptainPileDriver> don't be mean cause he's a bigger ginger then you @AngriestPat
[3:53:00] <KeiPrime> its still dece
[3:53:01] <%dking0000> That team isn’t even too bad tbh, I’d just put Cooler on point for assist purposes
[3:53:03] <arkv01> damn pat you're the opposite of woolies characters choices
[3:53:04] <Idon__> ya gotta learn when to take your turn
[3:53:05] <Worldbrand> pat's real team is elmo, skelmo, and steve buscelmo
[3:53:10] <Huntercd> Boo short hair
[3:53:16] <Leud_De_Grace> NO ESCAPE
[3:53:17] <%xGreenflame> Pat picks these character because it makes him feel big by extension
[3:53:22] <Leud_De_Grace> Videl a cute
[3:53:30] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> waifu on scren
[3:53:44] <%babrukus> saiyaman a cute
[3:53:45] <Worldbrand> good read
[3:53:47] <%CaptainPileDriver> @AngriestPat good job on that punish on the vanish
[3:53:58] <+badchoice5> Goku dunk: Unsuccessful
[3:53:59] <TheShockVox> @nobknee Who?
[3:53:59] <gottigotbundles> what's the discord so i can share tech
[3:54:03] <nobknee> When we are all bein's of pure energy, Pat will be the biggest poise boy.
[3:54:05] <%dking0000> Isn’t Cooler’s assist worse thank 16’s?
[3:54:11] <+TheHeroAppears> LUL pat
[3:54:11] <%CaptainPileDriver> you punished his vanish with the 2H
[3:54:17] <nobknee> @TheShockVox Sam Lloyd has brain tumor.
[3:54:22] <Worldbrand> that guy did the thingy and then you turned around and did the thingy
[3:54:23] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> cutie punch <3
[3:54:23] <oldmemesdiehard> Cell is probably my favorite character in this game
[3:54:25] <cool_culainn> Coolers assist is good
[3:54:28] <%Rhinoprotoss> Should go Broly Cooler 16, Broly has the worst assist of them
[3:54:34] <Idon__> yeyeye do combo
[3:54:37] <+a_deadbeat> I think it would be a good idea to switch one of these characters for Vegeta. They all work well with him, and each one works decently well with one other character on this team, but all three could use some help that the others just can't provide
[3:54:39] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> noo
[3:54:41] <+honorable_captain_garlock> 2h counters vanish like all airborne attacks
[3:54:41] <+johnny_volcano> hey pat, start off a cooler round with quarter circle back ki blast. It's a quick full screen low
[3:54:45] <KeiPrime> but broly is his level 3 do it guy
[3:54:45] <Aussie_Manny> KAPOW
[3:54:45] <+FrostedZaibatsu> @AngriestPat Super dash after a you do a assist combo with 16.
[3:54:49] <%CaptainPileDriver> @AngriestPat like chat said, honestly, broly should be your front man cause his assist isn't very good
[3:54:50] <KeiPrime> i understand that
[3:54:50] <%grimpo96> Videl Castro
[3:54:52] <+a_deadbeat> Broly's assist is super good
[3:54:53] <RoachOverlord> I think she might be dead
[3:54:55] <+akingofnoobs> did I already miss him playing the new dmc demo??
[3:54:58] <DavidSanChan> which cooler is cooler
[3:55:01] <fmc009> !uptime
[3:55:02] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 55m.
[3:55:04] <%FrostMass22> @nobknee He has cancer that's basically spread everywhere: like from his lung to his brain. We can't find a cure for cancer fast enough.
[3:55:05] <arkv01> alexa, read out chats advice
[3:55:06] <%dking0000> Broly assist is good if you know how to time it
[3:55:12] <+a_deadbeat> If anything, Broly has the best assist out of these three
[3:55:15] <%dking0000> The delay can help in neutral
[3:55:24] <raveous> he was still in hit stun so the grab wouldn't work
[3:55:26] <chester804> I'm just here to eat shortbread fudge cookies and chill before my performance evaluation tomorrow at work
[3:55:27] <KiraKamixephos> Cuz it doesn’t combo
[3:55:29] <Aussie_Manny> GG
[3:55:29] <+BrendorTheEndor> @AngriestPat every time you're in a combo, hold any attack button and a direction, it'll guarantee you pop out (in the direction you hold) if the combo has any holes in it. If the combo counter turns blue it means you could've escaped.
[3:55:31] <Idon__> you........ did it.
[3:55:37] <+honorable_captain_garlock> niceu niceu
[3:55:37] <%dking0000> If anything Broly’s level 1 is his worst move by far
[3:55:41] <KantusMonkus> hek
[3:55:43] <arkv01> yees....
[3:55:45] <arkv01> kill goku..
[3:55:49] <SeventyForce> Big boiz doin et
[3:55:51] <Aussie_Manny> he do it
[3:55:55] <Worldbrand> was it made to protect or destroy goku? im getting mixed messages
[3:55:56] <+BrendorTheEndor> aight cool just wanted to make sure
[3:55:57] <nobknee> @FrostMass22 Agreed. It's also why I support everyone gettin' into cryonics. Hey, if that shit doesn't work, who cares? You're dead, anyway. Better chance with ice than dirt or fire.
[3:55:57] <Idon__> Dr Gero definitely did not make you to protect what is precious
[3:56:03] <+mmSoTasty> kill goku or protect that which is precious? which is it?
[3:56:04] <ghostravens> kill_son_goku.exe
[3:56:05] <ACuddleyTeddy> Team Big Dick Energy
[3:56:09] <cool_culainn> His level used to be great but the super nerfs kinda screwed him
[3:56:12] <grimshuck> Hi Pat!
[3:56:12] <ghostravens> kill_son_goku. exe
[3:56:14] <+FrostedZaibatsu> @AngriestPat Super dash after a you do a assist combo with 16. Dont just dunnk again
[3:56:15] <fmc009> BUT HUGE BOYZ
[3:56:15] <+johnny_volcano> @angriestpat there's 3 really strong ways to open neutral with Cooler
[3:56:26] <musti_jaja_> Dragon ball fighterZ? HA, more like: Dragon balls purple PEE
[3:56:26] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> yea put a waifu in
[3:56:28] <stabbityrabbit> @AngriestPat Switch to Jiren
[3:56:28] <%ThePuddingDead> cuz broly is clearly your anchor
[3:56:32] <raveous> 16 is very good if you learn how to use him though
[3:56:34] <IOptimusGrimes> 16 the best lmao
[3:56:34] <+tintin1029> Play Jiren you coward
[3:56:35] <%jusros23> I'm next again
[3:56:38] <%Rhinoprotoss> Just change the order of your team
[3:56:39] <+honorable_captain_garlock> cell is good but he has weird combos like 16
[3:56:40] <SeventyForce> Killing Goku to protect Gohan is honestly the best thing to do
[3:56:48] <+WayneTheNerd> Jiren is BIG
[3:56:52] <%GlewmanIII> anchor is last character pat
[3:56:55] <%ThePuddingDead> fat buu is big
[3:56:59] <%Trinity5> @angriestpat last character alive
[3:57:00] <fmc009> Jiren is not big LUL
[3:57:02] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> @AngriestPat Hold back to block
[3:57:06] <%babrukus> fat buu is hard to learn
[3:57:07] <+BrendorTheEndor> point = first, anchor = last
[3:57:08] <%ThePuddingDead> Anchor is the one that can pull your balls outta the blender at the end
[3:57:13] <NicholasKane> Someone, after the match, explain to him the concepts of "point" and "anchor" and why they matter
[3:57:14] <ShichiNoBushi> If there was no Android 16 in Future Trunks's timeline, why are all the others numbered 17+? Was 16 just ignored and left in his box the whole time?
[3:57:16] <+a_deadbeat> You can only do one of each grab in a 16 combo
[3:57:16] <IOptimusGrimes> 1st character point, second mid, last is anchor
[3:57:18] <%Tokanova> android 16 vs goku black is basically 16's wet dream. an evil goku he has no reason to not want to kill
[3:57:21] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> Point guy: Starter, big damage
[3:57:21] <raveous> anchor is your last stand, tryhard, comeback character
[3:57:24] <+honorable_captain_garlock> pew pew
[3:57:29] <EMP_Ike_Turner> Pat’s journey to a DBFZ major starts now
[3:57:30] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> Battery: Character used to build super
[3:57:35] <nobknee> If I was gonna play any one character in this game, it'd be Fat Buu. Fat Buu is the best character in anything forever.
[3:57:35] <%CaptainPileDriver> @AngriestPat an anchor is the 3rd character on the team cause he's the character you have the most confidence and if it's your last character you have a better chance to win
[3:57:37] <%dking0000> Anchor’s are the clutch/assist characters
[3:57:41] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> Anchor: Comeback character
[3:57:42] <%ThePuddingDead> its mostly where u place them without tagging them away
[3:57:50] <%dking0000> Tien, Vegeta, etc
[3:57:55] <%Tokanova> future trunks should have been working with android 16 in super to try and fix the world
[3:57:55] <%ThePuddingDead> like for example, 17 is my point t. gohan is my anchor
[3:58:05] <%Rhinoprotoss> Anchor's are USUALLY last, not all the time
[3:58:08] <%ThePuddingDead> cuz t gohan is great with all those meters
[3:58:16] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Its basically your best character. Your ace in your back pocket.
[3:58:19] <TheShockVox> FINALLY IN!! Yes!
[3:58:23] <%ThePuddingDead> nj
[3:58:24] <raveous> hey I know what will make you like 16! use his alternate lvl 3
[3:58:26] <+BrendorTheEndor> @AngriestPat point character is first out, typically the one that works best with assists. Anchor is last so they typically live longest, and should have good assists and comeback potential. In general, order teams around assist strength
[3:58:28] <NicholasKane> @AngriestPat The anchor is the character who needs assists the least
[3:58:29] <+reluctant_monkey> american reset
[3:58:30] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> An anchor is the last runner in a relay or a part of a boat.
[3:58:35] <%babrukus> muh birds
[3:58:40] <%jusros23> here I go
[3:58:40] <+johnny_volcano> Tien is a great anchor
[3:58:47] <Mr_pwng3> protect the birds
[3:58:48] <musti_jaja_> h35
[3:58:49] <+mmSoTasty> birbs go away :(
[3:58:51] <IOptimusGrimes> an anchor is a character with good neutral, and a good assist.
[3:58:54] <Mr_pwng3> and the not birds
[3:59:01] <+a_deadbeat> Broly needs assists very badly
[3:59:02] <%CaptainPileDriver> basically, put broly on point
[3:59:03] <%jusros23> nvm thought I was next
[3:59:03] <%ThePuddingDead> broly by himself ur doing well
[3:59:03] <nobknee> @AngriestPat Give Sam Lloyd your energy. He got a big case of the Big C.
[3:59:05] <IOptimusGrimes> broly is a terrible anchor
[3:59:09] <%Rhinoprotoss> YES Broly needs to be point
[3:59:09] <Solid_as_a_brock> Touching your nose still applies when the grab is apart of the combo?
[3:59:15] <PessimisticOptimism> Play game
[3:59:16] <+a_deadbeat> Broly should definitely be on point
[3:59:19] <KeiPrime> but you do levle 3 with broly get the big wins
[3:59:20] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> Hence why ur sucking
[3:59:21] <%jusros23> I'm at this fight
[3:59:24] <+a_deadbeat> but so should A16 imo
[3:59:26] <%jusros23> after
[3:59:27] <%GingaNZ> put broly first
[3:59:29] <%dking0000> Broly is the best point on your team
[3:59:29] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> You're using broly as an anchor
[3:59:33] <%bigfado287> Is there a good source for team comp?
[3:59:33] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> when he should be a point
[3:59:35] <IOptimusGrimes> a16 a solid mid
[3:59:39] <%Aztec50> I have been told anchor is the character you are most comfortable with solo
[3:59:42] <musti_jaja_> what kinda shit line was that? "you made so much noise, the birds flew away" it was pretty stuff voice acting too
[3:59:43] <%dking0000> 16 should be the anchor if you want to optimize
[3:59:52] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 4 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 16oz (480mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[4:00:09] <IOptimusGrimes> @dking0000 don't tell a man who drops his combos to have a16 as anchor hahhaha
[4:00:10] <%ThePuddingDead> give it a try and change their positions, who know
[4:00:11] <%ThePuddingDead> s
[4:00:15] <%GeckoLeo> apatBig water
[4:00:15] <Tawbah_> Pat Don't freak out, but you might be one of my favorite people in the world.
[4:00:18] <%jusros23> @stay_hydrated_bot thank you for your service
[4:00:22] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> anime is real
[4:00:31] <+BrendorTheEndor> the mad lad missed

[4:01:01] <fmc009> That Goku is so low tho
[4:01:01] <tmix1600> Broly for point, 16 mid and Cooler for anchor
[4:01:02] <Jaxiis0> man I still need to get this game. it looks so good
[4:01:04] <EMP_Ike_Turner> super shredder pls
[4:01:09] <+johnny_volcano> @angriestpat don't run up with Cooler. a lot of his moves have great range or close the gap easily
[4:01:10] <KeiPrime> RIP
[4:01:12] <$TC_Lagann> @IOptimusGrimes Thank you kindly
[4:01:12] <%ThePuddingDead> damn happy birthdays
[4:01:18] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> TL;DR: Swap Broly and 16 in the lineup
[4:01:19] <%TheStarbecue> Anytime you get your opponent's health down to about half or less, start getting ready to punish their raw tag with a 2H @AngriestPat
[4:01:27] <%Kuro_Koshka> THERE YOU ARE
[4:01:31] <fmc009> what's the lobby number again? 1117?
[4:01:32] <IOptimusGrimes> @tc_lagann it's my favourite stick personally
[4:01:38] <nobknee> So, I've been outta the loop. Can DBFighterZ not be in any tournaments anymore still?
[4:01:38] <%GeckoLeo> @Yeajow One Sugar Free Redbull © is able to sustain a grown man for days.
[4:01:42] <%dking0000> 16 has better comeback potential, I’d say overall he’s a great anchor
[4:01:52] <%dking0000> At least for this team
[4:01:58] <$TC_Lagann> @IOptimusGrimes it looks SUPER cool, thought i might consider picking one up
[4:01:59] <%Rhinoprotoss> You need to actually put pressure on after knockdown
[4:02:01] <+BrendorTheEndor> @AngriestPat abuse cooler's crouch and jumping m at range, they are fucking HUGE
[4:02:03] <DavidSanChan> blow em up
[4:02:03] <fmc009> @nobknee Harada kinda fixed it. For now tourneys are safe
[4:02:04] <%ThePuddingDead> self destruct
[4:02:08] <%Rhinoprotoss> Oof
[4:02:09] <%ThePuddingDead> darn
[4:02:10] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> LUL
[4:02:11] <+honorable_captain_garlock> Maybe switch 16 for a really good assist / anchor ssj vegeta, ssj goku, black, tien.
[4:02:12] <NicholasKane> The character who needs assists the most should go first (the "point" position, since you'll have your other character's assists available. When your first two characters die, you only have one character left (the anchor), and they should be someone who you can play competently without using assists, since they won't have any available.

[4:06:58] <%ThePuddingDead> look at all that meter
[4:07:07] <nobknee> Are those shitty Universe 6 or whatever Saiyans in this game yet? The stupid shits that look like they never eat 'til they get roided up.
[4:07:09] <+Modern_Myth> yiu can reflect her rekkas pat
[4:07:10] <$TheCrispyBoi> the panic is real
[4:07:12] <tmix1600> What is wrong with this guy, he's going apeshit on Pat
[4:07:17] <%ThePuddingDead> that downward grab is nuts, i need to practice that
[4:07:19] <%Trinity5> @nobknee nope
[4:07:28] <%CaptainPileDriver> i mean

[4:07:58] <+NovaTera> final boss plankton
[4:08:00] <djbrooks603> @nobknee not yet, I would guess one of them are gonna be in season 2 though
[4:08:01] <+BrendorTheEndor> @AngriestPat might wanna try and use coolers HUGE mediums to keep distance (can combo off them) and use his DP to get them off you
[4:08:03] <%ThePuddingDead> oh well
[4:08:04] <%babrukus> HELLO
[4:08:07] <nobknee> I hate most Super stuff. Fuck that stupid little blue god.
[4:08:12] <+DrunkenDice> lytCANDY
[4:08:15] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> lewd
[4:08:16] <raveous> lab time?
[4:08:17] <%CaptainPileDriver> REALLY long
[4:08:18] <faegbeard> reset the vore clock
[4:08:19] <ShichiNoBushi> I just now remembered that Cell said he knew the Spirit Bomb, but I don't recall him ever using it.
[4:08:21] <+ArcanumMBD> @AngriestPat Just be confidant in your speed, you know
[4:08:23] <arkv01> shoe cell's feet
[4:08:25] <%Trinity5> quick chat cell bnbs rn
[4:08:27] <Mr_pwng3> bardoc has longer legs
[4:08:30] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> helOOO
[4:08:34] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> show cell bepis
[4:08:39] <ghostravens> hello~
[4:08:40] <%CaptainPileDriver> @AngriestPat do lab with cell for knowledge
[4:08:41] <%Trinity5> is "ba ba ba" the command grab?
[4:08:43] <%Spydurman> show feet
[4:08:43] <%GeckoLeo> Not the bepis!
[4:08:43] <King___Crimson> Cell has them bayonetta legs
[4:08:46] <%dking0000> I’d rather have Baby then any of the Universe 6 saiyans
[4:08:46] <%ThePuddingDead> this might be quick....
[4:08:48] <arkv01> technically cell has perfect legs
[4:08:49] <%babrukus> Hewwooooo~
[4:08:49] <%dozind16> how about some Halo 5 crendorLurk crendorLurk
[4:08:51] <ShichiNoBushi> I think that's his tail.
[4:08:53] <tmix1600> Broly legs are longest
[4:08:57] <$TC_Lagann> do you think we'll get Kale/Caulifla as character? or do you think they'll cop out and just throw Kefla at us?
[4:08:58] <Tawbah_> I brought this game, was super pumped, got bodied in ever match for about 4 days and never booted it up again :(
[4:08:59] <$ThirdStrike_Alex> cheer100 @angriestpat would you mind letting me know how you made your dummy account for DMCV demo? I’m sick and I can’t wait
[4:09:02] <fmc009> Could some of you guys give space to the people waiting outside of the lobby?
[4:09:13] <%ThePuddingDead> oh look another corner game
[4:09:15] <%dking0000> That’s the problem with fighting games
[4:09:19] <faegbeard> big blowups
[4:09:21] <%Rhinoprotoss> An actual serious Beerus???
[4:09:23] <%Spydurman> PogChamp
[4:09:24] <%Townspoon> ok so this guy is pretty good
[4:09:25] <%babrukus> eyyy get 'em beerus
[4:09:25] <%Trinity5> @tc_lagann I think its kefla and the dude saiyan coming
[4:09:25] <%Trabnaxes> God of Destruction
[4:09:30] <nobknee> Like, I also don't care for Beerus, but at least he can be punched. That shitty blue god takes all the tension out of anything.
[4:09:30] <arkv01> @fmc009 I'm not in the lobby but I imagine the short answer is 'pay me'
[4:09:33] <%dking0000> It feels like you have to crank in so much consistent time to see any growth
[4:09:43] <+sceptic62> Is pat playing casual pc or PS4?
[4:09:48] <$TC_Lagann> @Trinity5 im ok if Kefla gets in, i think cabba would be a waste though
[4:09:49] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> hey you know how cells tail vores people haha wouldn't it be funny if it vored people in this game haha that would be funny haha
[4:09:51] <+a_deadbeat> ps4
[4:09:54] <arkv01> hes on ps4 with all the killers
[4:09:56] <%Dagman72> oof
[4:10:05] <dsauce999> Pat's not hot.
[4:10:07] <%Xooler67> @dking0000 I agree and by the end you question if you're even having fun
[4:10:12] <Mr_pwng3> @tawbah_ the getting bodied gets less intense the more you play, or train with friends
[4:10:12] <%Idziman> pat jobs live on stream
[4:10:15] <%korth367> why is pat getting murdered
[4:10:16] <Mr_pwng3> it's fun
[4:10:17] <+sceptic62> Damn I wanted to play against him
[4:10:20] <lozscat> Fucking get dunked on pat
[4:10:23] <%Rhinoprotoss> Pat Jobs At
[4:10:25] <%Trabnaxes> Come on Sparda!
[4:10:29] <nobknee> Cell do combo
[4:10:34] <$TheCrispyBoi> lowtierpat
[4:10:35] <%Iplatypusprime> oh
[4:10:35] <%Trinity5> OR WAS IT
[4:10:40] <%Dagman72> dammit cell
[4:10:45] <%GeckoLeo> @DesuDesuDokiDoki Hahaha, yeah, that'd be a really funny prank. Not that I'm into vore, haha, just can appreciate a good ruse, hahahaha.
[4:10:46] <%dking0000> If I had a dollar for every time I picked up then dropped Tekken I’d be a rich man
[4:10:46] <%Spydurman> shouldn't have come to play with killers
[4:10:48] <+BrendorTheEndor> you can hold assist while getting hit and you'll tag out right after the combo, it can help keep characters alive, but can be risky if you do it too much
[4:10:50] <%babrukus> aw that flick would have been sick
[4:11:00] <%Trinity5> @spydurman lmfao
[4:11:03] <tmix1600> Pat would have done better against the xbox casuals, PS fighters fight to kill
[4:11:07] <%ThePuddingDead> watching this is making keep reinstalling this...im torn
[4:11:19] <gottigotbundles> that's what you get for letting your son play with killers
[4:11:20] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@dsauce999) (warning)
[4:11:20] <Leud_De_Grace> I wonder whats for dinner
[4:11:21] <%Xooler67> @dking0000 that was my experience the first time I played tekken 6 online
[4:11:22] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> @GeckoLeo yeah haha as a joke haha
[4:11:23] <$TC_Lagann> @Spydurman LUL
[4:11:35] <KiraKamixephos> Training mode?
[4:11:37] <%Dagman72> yamero
[4:11:37] <Mr_pwng3> @angriestpat lab in jump force?
[4:11:38] <nobknee> I think my team, if I ever played, would be fat Buu, Mr. Satan, and Dog.
[4:11:39] <dsauce999> LOW...TIER...GAWD
[4:11:46] <+badchoice5> Should we get Fuggins in here again?
[4:11:49] <+BrendorTheEndor> lab some bnb's man no worries
[4:11:50] <arkv01> its okay pat, we're having a good time
[4:11:52] <%Kuro_Koshka> It's okay Pat you can alsways play Smash Ultimate :v
[4:11:56] <%Trinity5> LUL
[4:11:59] <+FierceDeityGabriel> But Jotaro
[4:12:02] <Justinbattleborn> PAT GO TO THE LAB
[4:12:02] <$TC_Lagann> Jumpforce looks like the anime trash we deerve
[4:12:04] <%CaptainPileDriver> @AngriestPat it's better then mine, mine is like 1300 matches with 500 wins
[4:12:05] <%dking0000> Killer Instinct is the only fighting game I’ve sinked hundreds of hours into and that game is super approachable in comparison to other stuff out now
[4:12:07] <KeiPrime> the only lab jump force belongs in is a quarantine
[4:12:09] <Leud_De_Grace> Does pat play smash ultimate?
[4:12:16] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> its trash but you love it
[4:12:24] <+PenmanLupine> all 3D anime arena fighters are bad
[4:12:27] <+PenmanLupine> you can't change my mind
[4:12:30] <+phatmac16> Dio looks okay.?
[4:12:35] <%ThePuddingDead> you're not punishing those dragon pursuits NEARLY enough
[4:12:42] <+ArcanumMBD> @PenmanLupine I mean, you're not wrong, but I stll love them. They are my guilty pleasure
[4:12:49] <$TC_Lagann> i watched an extended gameplay yesterday and all i have to say is, Why does it have to look like that?
[4:12:49] <%dking0000> @penmanlupine this is the least controversial statement
[4:12:49] <Mr_pwng3> i was sad boku game was what i expected it to be
[4:12:52] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Jump Force the only thing keepingBleach and Yu Yu Hakusho alive FeelsBadMan
[4:12:52] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> @Leud_De_Grace he did a stream with fug and pag a while back.
[4:12:57] <dsauce999> *screams fighting game tips into the void*
[4:12:59] <Leud_De_Grace> Coo
[4:13:00] <tmix1600> Budokai Tenkaichi was legit
[4:13:01] <King___Crimson> Would Anarchy Reigns count as a 3D anime arena fighter?
[4:13:10] <MutedMimic> That dio walk animation though Kreygasm
[4:13:15] <%ThePuddingDead> the trick is not to block them
[4:13:20] <gottigotbundles> cooler has a dp
[4:13:22] <nobknee> I like Trunk's vogue hands.
[4:13:24] <%CaptainPileDriver> @AngriestPat if you know it's coming, 2H if you blocked it, try jab or vanish honestly
[4:13:24] <%ThePuddingDead> time them with downH
[4:13:28] <%Trinity5> isnt superdash safe on block?
[4:13:29] <Mr_pwng3> easy advice: if you meet a vegito player in real life STAB them
[4:13:30] <+ArcanumMBD> @King___Crimson AR isn't anime enough sadly
[4:13:33] <%CaptainPileDriver> just be carefull
[4:13:33] <$TC_Lagann> @MutedMimic ok... i will give you the DIO walk as classy LUL
[4:13:38] <%Trinity5> @mr_pwng3 that's facts
[4:13:38] <arkv01> i played bid for power on a pentium 3 with no dedicated gpu FeelsBadMan
[4:13:41] <%dking0000> Even if we count Anarchy Reigns it’s such a rare exception
[4:13:43] <King___Crimson> HEY
[4:13:48] <dyja> pat i love you so much man
[4:13:49] <KiraKamixephos> Rip birb
[4:13:52] <%ThePuddingDead> thatll work
[4:13:55] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> RIP birb
[4:14:00] <ScreamingMeat> @AngriestPat Jump Force's artstyle looks like garbage. Everyone is in 3D versions of their original art style (Which doesn't alway translate well to begin with) and then everything has this gritty, dirty texture on top of it.
[4:14:03] <%Nobrev> that was an oof round
[4:14:05] <%Dagman72> rip
[4:14:09] <%GeckoLeo> @DePhat1 Condolences, what kinda birb?
[4:14:10] <nobknee> @DePhat1 I'm sorry for your loss. My best Friend left me tonight, so I empathize. Different pain, but bad pain, too.
[4:14:12] <%dking0000> And that’s only because it’s fucking Platinum
[4:14:15] <Ugato> Pat bravely defeats a young teenage girl
[4:14:16] <+badchoice5> Use the autocombo!
[4:14:25] <+BrendorTheEndor> about superdash, if you block it they're safe, but you can try to stuff them with a safe jab because they might try to follow up
[4:14:32] <%ThePuddingDead> damn UUUUUUU
[4:14:35] <%DePhat1> @GeckoLeo Budgie
[4:14:37] <ScreamingMeat> DAMN UUUUUU
[4:14:38] <$TC_Lagann> you need it pat...
[4:14:39] <%Nobrev> @ScreamingMeat some characters from older series look fine enough. art style aside the game looks fun to play
[4:14:43] <dsauce999> just react and counter everything they do 4Head
[4:14:43] <lozscat> L
[4:14:47] <Tawbah_> @DePhat1 Sorry for your bird dude :(
[4:14:47] <%CaptainPileDriver> @AngriestPat no
[4:14:55] <+ArcanumMBD> @AngriestPat some characters auto combo is a legit part of combos
[4:14:55] <+BrendorTheEndor> autocombo teleports you into proper position, seriously
[4:14:58] <%CaptainPileDriver> @AngriestPat some auto moves only come out with autocombos
[4:14:59] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> It's training wheels
[4:15:01] <%Nobrev> apatWrong
[4:15:05] <Ugato> It’s a trap if it’s all you use, from what I understand
[4:15:10] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> Also it has some bullshit properties
[4:15:11] <%ThePuddingDead> in the middle of a fight? u silly?
[4:15:11] <+BrendorTheEndor> they make you gain height and are good startes
[4:15:14] <+BrendorTheEndor> starters
[4:15:15] <King___Crimson> Remember when Videl kicked a guy so hard that his head turned a full 180 degrees?
[4:15:20] <KeiPrime> some characters have unique moves in their autocombos i know that much
[4:15:20] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> That let you magnetically float towards enemies
[4:15:22] <+ArcanumMBD> LAB
[4:15:24] <+a_deadbeat> @AngriestPat It might be a good idea to play against Woolie, I think he's actually around the same skill level. Should make figuring the flow of the game easier than playing against a bunch of style beasts
[4:15:24] <$TC_Lagann> always use it
[4:15:25] <%Spydurman> git gud
[4:15:25] <%dking0000> If you decide to stick with Broly, his regular Ki blasts are surprisingly good @angriestpat
[4:15:25] <+badchoice5> Take it to the lab
[4:15:25] <KeiPrime> the lab
[4:15:27] <+ArcanumMBD> DO LAB
[4:15:31] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> ULTRA INSTINCT
[4:15:31] <%CaptainPileDriver> @AngriestPat practice
[4:15:32] <%ThePuddingDead> u need practice
[4:15:33] <%babrukus> chaaaaaaaaracter specific
[4:15:33] <ebonifragaria> Uh oh! Back to the lab again
[4:15:34] <Ugato> Never stop going in
[4:15:34] <KiraKamixephos> LABBO
[4:15:35] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> DO TIME
[4:15:35] <+BrendorTheEndor> mash it out when they block and confirm if it hits
[4:15:37] <%GeckoLeo> @DePhat1 Aw, well sorry to hear that, man.Hope you feel better.
[4:15:43] <dsauce999> JUST TIME HARDER
[4:15:45] <$TC_Lagann> just ask Max 4Head
[4:15:48] <Ninjagregory98> Why not spend time in training mode?
[4:15:49] <+tigerfang86> implying labbing on stream would be good for a stream haHAA
[4:15:59] <%Trinity5> I love lab streams
[4:16:02] <Ugato> Jiren too strong
[4:16:03] <+Promessa_EX> max does it for like 4-7k viewers
[4:16:04] <%Trinity5> but I get it
[4:16:08] <%dking0000> That’s always been another problem with fighting games
[4:16:10] <Mr_pwng3> is doing lab way to avoid salt and pain from slowly learning in ranked beat downs?
[4:16:12] <Tawbah_> How do you activate the Stands?
[4:16:12] <Ninjagregory98> It’s been done before
[4:16:14] <%ThePuddingDead> dontchu wanna beat Maximillian?
[4:16:15] <+BlainPLD> Pat, I am so sorry. This is why I dont play Fighting Games
[4:16:16] <+xpakeo> a solid 60% of fighting game streams tend to be labbing
[4:16:18] <%ThePuddingDead> DONTCHU?
[4:16:20] <%Dagman72> Activate Kid Mode
[4:16:20] <nobknee> Alright, goodnight, lads. Enjoy combo
[4:16:21] <+BlainPLD> This hurts
[4:16:22] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Same people not leaving the lobby 😡
[4:16:23] <dsauce999> I would watch the lab
[4:16:24] <%dking0000> Labbing sucks if you’re not into it
[4:16:29] <+tigerfang86> ^
[4:16:30] <%GeckoLeo> @nobknee Night!
[4:16:33] <Ugato> Yeah see I don’t give a shit about fighting games so comparing this to max is probably not the same thing
[4:16:40] <Ugato> Considering his brand and all
[4:16:44] <KiraKamixephos> Usually streamers start off in the lab before going into online fights
[4:16:46] <MutedMimic> LUL
[4:16:47] <%DePhat1> @GeckoLeo Thanks dude <3
[4:16:55] <+badchoice5> Losing is worse
[4:16:57] <%ThePuddingDead> stop being difficult pat...hoe mah gosh
[4:16:57] <%GeckoLeo> <3
[4:16:57] <Dao_Puppy> So no 7 hour lab stream?
[4:17:00] <+ArcanumMBD> Lab while waiting in queue for multiplayer
[4:17:00] <%dking0000> Some people are super into breaking a game down and shit but it can feel like wasted time when you face real people
[4:17:01] <$TheCrispyBoi> @AngriestPat you need to lab...
[4:17:04] <+SpikedFreak> 6 frames of delay doesn't help, jfc
[4:17:04] <$TC_Lagann> id watch a coaching session with you and Sensei Maz
[4:17:12] <+phatmac16> Labs are for nerds
[4:17:14] <+badchoice5> That's fair
[4:17:15] <Ugato> I mean go nuts, I just won’t watch it
[4:17:18] <+xpakeo> labbing is fun once you know what your doing
[4:17:19] <%WackyXmand> if you don't remember how to play a character then go practice
[4:17:21] <Run44forrest> thats what i thought but then i labbed for an hour and got big and strong
[4:17:24] <KiraKamixephos> Learning how to play sure sucks
[4:17:24] <ScreamingMeat> Cell doesn't look half bad in Red. Must be because Red is Green's compliment
[4:17:24] <Shooterboy23> Yeah but nobody likes to watch you get your ass kicked online
[4:17:24] <%CaptainPileDriver> @AngriestPat that's. like, weird.
[4:17:26] <exalt4747> I really hope this doesn't discourage Pat from streaming fighting games. ):
[4:17:31] <+badchoice5> Same reason I still suck at guitar
[4:17:36] <Mr_pwng3> flashbacks to how sucky the campaign of this game was
[4:17:40] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> @Shooterboy23 i do
[4:17:42] <Doc1790> Who needs labbing when you can lose faster? Keepo
[4:17:47] <Mr_pwng3> 7 hour lab against bread dead bots
[4:17:49] <%LixFury> I'd rather learn from play then practice
[4:17:51] <+amazinggamingchannel> 7 frame delay looking rough....
[4:17:54] <%dking0000> “Turn that L into a lesson”
[4:17:55] <$TC_Lagann> its like watching a fighter suffer from Osteoporosis
[4:17:59] <danknugglit> I love watching pat get his shit pushed in LUL
[4:18:01] <%GeckoLeo> I just like watching the pretty colors and the big bois doing good hits on each other.
[4:18:03] <$TC_Lagann> drink your milk pat
[4:18:05] <+Promessa_EX> never practice or study kids, just try really hard
[4:18:08] <Run44forrest> we need woolie to set pat straight
[4:18:09] <%FrostMass22> I'm not well versed in fighting games. If Pat was in training mode the whole time, I would not be able to drop the stream fast enough.
[4:18:18] <fmc009> ... how does one improve if not for training mode?
[4:18:20] <%CaptainPileDriver> @AngriestPat so you'd rather be bodied and not get actual chances to test out combos?
[4:18:27] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Pat drank all the milk. Then got upset when he didn't grow bigger
[4:18:27] <%Rhinoprotoss> Of course not
[4:18:33] <eccentricprinceofroses> have you watched Woolie's video on the basics? :)
[4:18:39] <Tawbah_> @Promessa_EX Also Remember if something is hard to do, its prob not even worth it so give up super hard
[4:18:39] <King___Crimson> DAB
[4:18:45] <%GeckoLeo> apatDab
[4:18:47] <$TC_Lagann> @fmc009 i believe he's going the B"Brute Force" technique, forbidden by the ancients
[4:18:48] <%CaptainPileDriver> @AngriestPat i mean, if you're ded you can't
[4:18:49] <Run44forrest> training stream would be hype. we all PogChamp when Pat does combo
[4:18:50] <%ThePuddingDead> really? how's that gone so far?
[4:18:53] <Shooterboy23> the reason is that you're too busy eating a combo yourself
[4:18:53] <+Anonymasque> Labbing is a very repetative process and not everyone can learn like that. Just cause some "experts" do it..
[4:18:55] <%Stratiotai2> LEARN BY DOIN, CHAT
[4:18:56] <Kalcom> then auto comboin a match
[4:18:59] <+amazinggamingchannel> it's very possible to learn a lot by throwing your face into the wall in fighting games
[4:19:02] <%Nobrev> you can get a better feel for how to do it right in practice though
[4:19:05] <+amazinggamingchannel> you just need fundamentals in order to do so
[4:19:06] <%LixFury> you can lab a combo all day, but if you cant land it in a real match whats the point LUL
[4:19:09] <+Promessa_EX> @Tawbah_ sage
[4:19:12] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> All gokus. Oopsie
[4:19:16] <ManfredA> You can learn by getting your ass kicked in fighting games, there's no one way to do things
[4:19:19] <Shooterboy23> this entire chat is a scrub quote goldmine btw
[4:19:20] <%3xgilly> no feel good about this match
[4:19:21] <battlebeast67> Hey Pat I'm just happy you're playing the game still
[4:19:21] <ScreamingMeat> When are Trunks and Goten going to suddenly grow 3+ feet taller and loose all their baby fat?
[4:19:22] <danknugglit> Let pat play his vidya games chat BabyRage
[4:19:22] <Tawbah_> Giving up is an art form,
[4:19:25] <+badchoice5> When the alternative is no combo, yes
[4:19:25] <%dking0000> You really have to be a specific kind of person to enjoy labbing

[4:20:32] <%dking0000> @angriestpat you can probably get Cooler assist of brolys air throw
[4:20:35] <%Tomiko0> I'd try to give advice, but I suck way more shit at DBFZ than him, so... apatJpeg
[4:20:37] <Run44forrest> labbing is boring but then you get good
[4:20:37] <+phatmac16> Ignore chat
[4:20:43] <Shooterboy23> how can you be "on tilt" when you didnt lab? LUL what you forgetting, the pause button?

[4:21:27] <+WhatTheFlox> brucegScared
[4:21:29] <$TheCrispyBoi> maybe you should lab it........
[4:21:33] <+ArcanumMBD> Cooler assist before you do the throw maybe?
[4:21:37] <+JohnXuandou> you know maybe if you labbed it you could learn the timing, funny thing that

[4:21:50] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Soul Cal LUL
[4:21:52] <ScreamingMeat> Before Zamatsu was ruined as a villain Goku Black's english voice actually did sound bad ass. Even if it was just Normal Goku's voice actor acting evil
[4:21:52] <ManfredA> yeah I figured, was just wondering
[4:21:52] <+Anonymasque> I'm not saying labbing is boring. Just not everyone can learn that way.

[4:23:22] <+Heroes_of_Vale> On fire? Again?
[4:23:22] <%Stratiotai2> why would he lab something if he is going to hate it. He can play this way, enjoy the game and learn by DOING his way. ya'll need to lower then salt levels
[4:23:26] <%CaptainPileDriver> @AngriestPat then go back to 16 on your team since you learned how to play him again
[4:23:29] <Run44forrest> i want to play yamcha but my dick isnt big enough
[4:23:29] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Wrong. California is in mud season after being on fire
[4:23:31] <Mr_pwng3> If youre worried about sucking without assists, play nappa Kappa
[4:23:32] <dsauce999> Bruh, just pick a top tier 4Head
[4:23:33] <Tawbah_> @DesuDesuDokiDoki when is it not on fire?
[4:23:41] <+Anonymasque> Chat is a big bully today, huh?
[4:23:42] <tmix1600> I think Pat needs Nappa
[4:23:43] <%ThePuddingDead> eyy
[4:23:46] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> LUL
[4:23:49] <Shooterboy23> @Stratiotai2 maybe they just dont enjoy one sided matches and just wanna see him get better
[4:23:54] <gottigotbundles> I'm next
[4:24:01] <ManfredA> sounds like a them problem tbh
[4:24:09] <%ThePuddingDead> he still at the same room?

[4:26:11] <+McLellanJ> remember when sfv was good? I dont
[4:26:19] <+a_deadbeat> Cell's assist is best for neutral I think
[4:26:20] <Hammerknife> is this saltybet
[4:26:20] <%CaptainPileDriver> @AngriestPat broly, throw the cell assist in the corner and go for command grab cause they'll be blocking
[4:26:22] <%bevyrage> throw to air maybe
[4:26:22] <%Tomiko0> Crazy Talk on all the fuckers in chat who didn't #Believe.
[4:26:29] <%dking0000> Honestly if your old team works better stick with it
[4:26:30] <+a_deadbeat> jump back, call Cell, move in
[4:26:31] <kakdela7> hey pat I noticed you don't tend to block overheads in the corner and they're always getting you that way
[4:26:34] <%Tomiko0> <3
[4:26:40] <%Dagman72> #Believeit
[4:26:52] <tmix1600> Broly point use armor, switch Nappa to mid and Cooler for anchor

[4:28:14] <%VanaSkiller> consider other people want to glass Pat too
[4:28:15] <Ugato> They want to piss you off to make you lab so they can watch that
[4:28:20] <%CaptainPileDriver> i've gotten my matches in
[4:28:21] <KiraKamixephos> I left after our first match :(
[4:28:23] <Kalcom> like there's new pepole
[4:28:45] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> We didn't even see the 16
[4:28:45] <%ThePuddingDead> christ
[4:28:46] <+LowEnergyStarman> Did I walk into an ass whoppin'?
[4:28:54] <%iwishthiswasicq> Yeah, I thought it was pretty obvious to leave after your match.
[4:28:59] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@ArcanumMBD)
[4:29:04] <danknugglit> Just win Kappa
[4:29:09] <+joeypinoli> you can combo into dragon rush off of certain moves
[4:29:09] <TheShockVox> I’m actually honored I got to play him
[4:29:12] <+blademaster247> Broly can combo off of his lvl 3
[4:29:13] <+a_deadbeat> yeah, Broly's alternate level 3 makes things pretty hard to interpret
[4:29:15] <%Trinity5> yeah people use that in setups
[4:29:17] <%CaptainPileDriver> pat, maybe, just, go, practice
[4:29:20] <%ThePuddingDead> yeha pat if u need to kick, go for it, im sure no hard feelings
[4:29:30] <%dking0000> Broly has some dumb stuff with bar
[4:29:34] <atkScrub> broly has crazy mixes in the corner, command grabs are dirty
[4:29:37] <gottigotbundles> I called cooler assist then did the r1 version of his lvl 3 then sparked. threw you into lvl 1
[4:29:39] <tmix1600> If they are stunned enough you can throw
[4:29:41] <+CeeSaw> He called a 16 assist right before the slow version of brolys level 3. That gave him enough time to land and grab
[4:29:47] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> !uptime
[4:29:47] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 29m.
[4:29:49] <gottigotbundles> *r2 version
[4:29:53] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> 2 hours is right
[4:29:57] <danknugglit> Let steam slave play the game the way he wants BabyRage
[4:29:57] <+blademaster247> Practice defense
[4:29:59] <%Rhinoprotoss> Welcome to fight games
[4:30:10] <tmix1600> Is Pat getting redder?
[4:30:10] <fmc009> Is there space in the lobby now?
[4:30:12] <RezzyOK> learning how to training mode is definitely a skill in its own right
[4:30:17] <Kalcom> yes
[4:30:18] <perfectlypoorgaming> please check out my youtube channel its's perfectypoorgaming thank you!
[4:30:18] <%ssjklyco> There should be aspot now
[4:30:19] <Ugato> If I had the game I’d be glad to jump in and get blown out harder than pat even remotely has lost so far
[4:30:23] <kakdela7> ultra instinct pat
[4:30:28] <Samex_Comex> Smash them all!
[4:30:30] <tmix1600> Im worried now
[4:30:34] <%dking0000> The worst thing in the world is knowing your doing something wrong but not knowing how to learn and improve
[4:30:41] <Run44forrest> hey pat theres this guy on youtube called woolieversus you should check his stuff oout
[4:30:44] <+badchoice5> Didn't Bruce Lee have a saying about how practicing the same shit over and over was the best way to train?
[4:30:49] <%Dagman72> BURN EM ALL
[4:30:58] <%ThePuddingDead> still at room 4?
[4:31:02] <%CaptainPileDriver> fine, there's so much bnb and what you need online like you used to tell us in FNF. i'm out for tonight
[4:31:05] <fmc009> Yeah but Bruce Lee is dead Kappa
[4:31:14] <%ThePuddingDead> take it easy dude, thnx for info
[4:31:15] <McAngrimStein> shoulda practiced living
[4:31:20] <VolumetricMike> I can't believe Pat is streaming DBF at the same time as Max! Why are you trying to steal his views? XD
[4:31:26] <tmix1600> Pat i think you might need some water buddy
[4:31:30] <%ThePuddingDead> there ya go
[4:31:31] <battlebeast67> A blue square. I haven't seen that awhile.
[4:31:32] <Hammerknife> wait how come i can't place bets on red or blue here
[4:31:34] <EMP_Ike_Turner> Isn’t this the Chris and Wesker volcano
[4:31:35] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Not really. Bruce Lee said he fears the man who practiced the same punch 1000 times over the man with 1000 different punches
[4:31:38] <kakdela7> did gohna say yikes?
[4:31:42] <%iwishthiswasicq> You don't have to learn how to move your arms and legs when you start training in martial arts.
[4:31:44] <Run44forrest> howd bruce lee die again
[4:31:45] <%Dagman72> W
[4:31:50] <%CaptainPileDriver> nothing, just rank
[4:31:52] <Run44forrest> weakest
[4:31:53] <+blademaster247> It means he lost a bunch
[4:31:54] <RezzyOK> means baddie
[4:31:55] <+a_deadbeat> Blue square is the lowest skill ranking
[4:31:55] <danknugglit> His power is MAXIMUM
[4:31:57] <+fugatlas> its the rank by their gamer tag
[4:31:58] <%CaptainPileDriver> @AngriestPat low rank
[4:32:03] <+fugatlas> blue square means the lose alot
[4:32:05] <tmix1600> Blue square is bad win rate
[4:32:07] <wolvenelf> means im garb
[4:32:09] <cool_culainn> I thought white was lowest??
[4:32:10] <%ThePuddingDead> ah, i see Im on PC....oh well
[4:32:15] <Kalcom> oh no
[4:32:19] <ogcornflakes> white is unranked
[4:32:21] <%ThePuddingDead> i guess i can practice in the quiet channel
[4:32:21] <NicholasKane> white is havent played enough to get a rank
[4:32:21] <alwayspronking> uh oh
[4:32:22] <Kalcom> its pink
[4:32:24] <+blademaster247> White means not enough match data to rank
[4:32:24] <tmix1600> White is new
[4:32:26] <+fugatlas> white is the square you get before you are assigned a color I think?
[4:32:26] <%CaptainPileDriver> @AngriestPat night, sorry, just wanna see you get better cause i want to see you at EVO
[4:32:28] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> White is the starting. Blue is after the record kicks in
[4:32:28] <Run44forrest> white just means they havent played enough to get a rank
[4:32:33] <battlebeast67> I think Pink is the highest rank.
[4:32:39] <EMP_Ike_Turner> Men in pink how bizarre
[4:32:55] <fmc009> for the dudes making space on the lobby, thanks <3
[4:32:58] <danknugglit> Pat rank is best rank <3
[4:32:59] <%ThePuddingDead> anybody on PC version, canada east server room 4
[4:33:00] <%dking0000> I just noticed how dumb Broly’s hair looks
[4:33:01] <NicholasKane> if you dont wear pink you're a coward
[4:33:06] <%ThePuddingDead> pretty low rank myself but I need pracice
[4:33:09] <%iwishthiswasicq> Man, I hope Videl is good enough to get some tournament play.
[4:33:21] <cool_culainn> God videl is a blender of pain to block
[4:33:25] <%Rhinoprotoss> Yeah so fighting games
[4:33:25] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> pat is salt
[4:33:27] <krin_x> I would wanna play but I would probably have a 20f connection
[4:33:32] <+a_deadbeat> I think Videl is definitely good enough for tournament
[4:33:38] <DreamerTTV> Is the dmc 5 demo out on ps4 yet?
[4:33:41] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> or just look up combos
[4:33:44] <+a_deadbeat> She's got some good mix and pretty good neutral too
[4:33:44] <EMP_Ike_Turner> Apparently Japan is all over Videl
[4:33:46] <%CaptainPileDriver> @AngriestPat why is it when you explain things you get really good at blocking
[4:33:49] <danknugglit> Videl combos>
[4:33:49] <%lewdskeletor13> This ginger is still streaming? DansGame
[4:33:51] <+noajenkk> videl is amazing
[4:33:52] <Run44forrest> id say do ranked for fundamentals
[4:33:54] <RezzyOK> first thing I'd practice is extending your combo with each assist
[4:33:56] <+noajenkk> and yeah japan is all over videl
[4:33:59] <+noajenkk> sonicfox is playing her too
[4:34:02] <%dking0000> It’s like the difference between learning a character and learning the game
[4:34:06] <RezzyOK> just to get more comfortable using them
[4:34:07] <tmix1600> Pat wants to understand the game from a playing stand point
[4:34:08] <+badchoice5> In 100% seriousness, I bet Woolie both has all these answers and would love to tell you them (long term solution)
[4:34:14] <%iwishthiswasicq> Fuck, I can't believe Videl is actually getting me back into this game.
[4:34:17] <Doc1790> KEEP EXPLAINING
[4:34:18] <%Fruitywhompus> its the defensiveness
[4:34:21] <+noajenkk> videl is so dope
[4:34:22] <%dking0000> Knowing how to play Jin and knowing how to play Tekken are two different things
[4:34:26] <fmc009> Learning the game be hard,
[4:34:29] <CrimsonBrave> you could just ask chat what may be best to learn
[4:34:32] <%BestTeaMaker> just keep talking
[4:34:33] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> keep talking
[4:34:33] <%Tomiko0> Maybe the problem is less that he's bad and more that he's fighting people with 20x more times under their belt? apatJpeg
[4:34:38] <%TheStarbecue> Explain astrophysics and block forever
[4:34:42] <%BestTeaMaker> Crazy Talk has evolved where just talking affects your ability to block
[4:34:43] <danknugglit> Dont think FEEL
[4:34:49] <Kalcom> is this a side effect of crazy talk
[4:34:51] <%ThePuddingDead> there ya go
[4:34:52] <%Tomiko0> Pretend I said the smart words~
[4:34:52] <%TheStarbecue> Neil deGrasse Tyson never gets opened up
[4:34:54] <$Princepurple8> Im trading in a bunch of games tomorrow and this is one of them.
[4:34:54] <KeiPrime> crazy block
[4:34:56] <%lewdskeletor13> Feel the heart of the cards
[4:34:58] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> tell us how your day has been patrick
[4:34:58] <Hammerknife> well at least he's choosing who to play with and not getting streamsniped?
[4:34:58] <%CaptainPileDriver> @AngriestPat either way, i gotta work as a carryout/cart pushing job tomorrow in snow and ice by myself for 7 hours, see yall next stream.
[4:34:59] <tmix1600> Woolie is the Goku to Pats Vegeta
[4:35:00] <kakdela7> pat maybe you should play a standard character like goku or bardock to get the fundamentals?
[4:35:03] <+fugatlas> videl plays like a weird p4a character but in a good way
[4:35:07] <%dking0000> You can’t really lab to learn the game
[4:35:14] <fmc009> LUL
[4:35:28] <%iwishthiswasicq> Using Persona as a comparison is a sure way to get me to care.
[4:35:30] <%dking0000> You have to get a good enough understanding of how other people play to even know how to play the game
[4:35:41] <%laserbeaming> All Gokus are lame
[4:35:41] <fmc009> Fundamentals in this are hmmmmm not the same as other fighters
[4:35:45] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> pat u smell
[4:35:50] <%Solidus_113> I thought you gave up like an hour ago woolieMIRIN
[4:35:50] <+Anonymasque> Aren't we all a little lame in some way?
[4:35:51] <Run44forrest> pat is a lot like vegeta! short, receding hairline, angry
[4:35:59] <fmc009> SALT IN CONTROL
[4:36:00] <%Xooler67> @desudesudokidoki smells good
[4:36:04] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> smell of salt
[4:36:05] <%dking0000> Once you learn the game then labbing actually does something
[4:36:06] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Hey, Pat. I like you. No hard feelings
[4:36:10] <+CarlitosAP> gg Pat, I'm gonna leave so other people can play
[4:36:12] <+a_deadbeat> As someone who went down this same path, its definitely difficult to learn the game at the same time you learn a non-conventional character like Broly
[4:36:13] <Ugato> You are doing fine Pat
[4:36:18] <Dao_Puppy> Well, there's always Kage.
[4:36:19] <dimmensional> what time is it where you are
[4:36:24] <danknugglit> Dont be salt youre doing fine :)
[4:36:24] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Oh, you're getting better. It's just ridiculously easy to get pwned.
[4:36:24] <lozscat> Low Sodium Levels

[4:36:33] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> AM
[4:36:35] <+badchoice5> An assist is not a temporary buff

[4:36:47] <%Dagman72> sidenote: I'm going to Japan this April. any basic tips or what to avoid

[4:36:51] <%AncelDeLambert> dc?
[4:36:55] <RezzyOK> are you comfortable 6ming into an assist to extend?
[4:37:04] <+badchoice5> DO IT ON STREAM
[4:37:04] <%Tomiko0> Yeah, I don't think Pat's playing bad as much as he is playing against incredibly experienced players. apatJpeg
[4:37:04] <faegbeard> Life is a temporary buff.
[4:37:06] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> YEYEYEYEE
[4:37:09] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> DO IT

[4:37:25] <Dao_Puppy> @dking0000 Htiting the trigger button? : p
[4:37:26] <+Anonymasque> Oh thank christ a break
[4:37:32] <gottigotbundles> pick a saga and I'll play a team based on it
[4:37:39] <Run44forrest> frieza
[4:37:40] <ManfredA> Android
[4:37:40] <%TheStarbecue> Pat is sponsored by Not Pissing His Pants
[4:37:48] <%dking0000> @dao_puppy not even wrong, Cody’s V Triggers are dope
[4:37:51] <+Maids4lyfe> all this time I just now realized that's an IV drip of mustard and not a mustard bottle LUL
[4:37:54] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Said lost connection to host on this end @Jackedalot123
[4:38:00] <Run44forrest> base goku frieza base vegeta would be pretty cool
[4:38:02] <gottigotbundles> freiza it is hero or Villians?
[4:38:03] <Ugato> It didn’t look like Pat did anything to cause the DC
[4:38:04] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> @gottigotbundles play all waifus
[4:38:07] <%AncelDeLambert> well, it's that he's playing against experienced players AND he's been going for three hours
[4:38:14] <%8inchepinch> Sourpls
[4:38:23] <Hammerknife> well back to watching exhibs
[4:38:24] <Jackedalot123> Weird. I played Pat earlier and the connection was solid
[4:38:25] <mikesapartment> where did patrick go???
[4:38:31] <Dao_Puppy> @dking0000 plural? You use the knife too? I only ever see the pipe.
[4:38:33] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> pee break
[4:38:34] <Run44forrest> he piss
[4:38:34] <gottigotbundles> don't have jiren and videl yet
[4:38:35] <dsauce999> certified B A N G E R
[4:38:40] <%Tomiko0> In-Game: 40hrs vs 800hrs Chat: Must be those damn assists
[4:38:43] <Ugato> He’s just using it as a chance to water the toilet
[4:38:47] <%Tomiko0> apatJpeg
[4:38:59] <%dking0000> @dao_puppy knife can do some goofy stuff if you just throw it a ton
[4:38:59] <Run44forrest> pat should do ranked and fight other jobbers
[4:39:00] <%AncelDeLambert> apatRaffle
[4:39:05] <%8inchepinch> This song is good enough to go on repeat for a bit
[4:39:21] <%TheStarbecue> He's sacrificing his liquid to Piss God tm
[4:39:22] <%tiishi> ayo peeps, im back.... and i see pat will be shortly
[4:39:24] <+Anonymasque> I'm having second thoughts on DBFZ maybe it's too inaccessable after a certain point to people at a certain skill level..
[4:39:29] <%dking0000> Pipe is taking me a while to get all the timings down
[4:39:36] <fmc009> @AngriestPat whatever the fuck happens, you should do more streams with fight games cuz if you prefer this to labbing than maybe continue with more streams
[4:39:41] <%dking0000> So knife kinda simplifies thkngs
[4:39:41] <+badchoice5> So Pat, how's the dick?
[4:39:44] <Ugato> That’s a lot of fighting games really
[4:39:52] <%AncelDeLambert> @anonymasque isn't that ALL fighting games, tho?
[4:39:54] <ghostravens> Piss Speedrun any%
[4:40:00] <%VanaSkiller> you lick them hands clean?
[4:40:01] <dsauce999> Just play divekick Kappa
[4:40:11] <Ugato> This one is better than most because it’s more popular, so there’s more jobbers around
[4:40:12] <danknugglit> Speed pee PogChamp
[4:40:13] <%dking0000> You have to play the game a lot to really know how it works
[4:40:13] <+casualbaloth> just finished listening to the podcast, why did you cancel titanfall 3 pat?
[4:40:25] <%ThePuddingDead> pat does this room match PC version or just ps4?
[4:40:27] <EMP_Ike_Turner> When’s Virtual On MrDestructoid
[4:40:28] <Dao_Puppy> @dking0000 Pipe rocks seem like a bit of a chance, what makes me angry fighting him is that with the pipe he kind of turns into a grappler which is a mid match shift I have trouble with.
[4:40:30] <+mmSoTasty> fuckin bussass
[4:40:37] <Ugato> But eventually the general skill ceiling of a game just goes up
[4:40:37] <Run44forrest> theres no real reason to put a password its not like a rando will join
[4:40:39] <%BestTeaMaker> Pat is definitely not a marvel guy
[4:40:45] <+dawsfloss> hi pat teathePickme
[4:40:48] <fmc009> Dude I am still weird with assits
[4:40:49] <Ugato> For vs games like this
[4:40:51] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> PatDisconnectedMe cmonBruh
[4:40:54] <%ThePuddingDead> buss?
[4:40:57] <+a_deadbeat> Honestly, just call assists at weird times and get a feel for what works
[4:40:58] <fmc009> BACK IN
[4:41:00] <%dking0000> @dao_puppy the fact pipe is two bars is something I’ll always say is super dumb
[4:41:01] <+badchoice5> He's bussing your ass
[4:41:03] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> he play
[4:41:04] <%BestTeaMaker> HERE WE GO
[4:41:05] <Run44forrest> he cannot stop bussin
[4:41:12] <%Nobrev> you should kick that dude
[4:41:12] <danknugglit> LUL greedy chat
[4:41:14] <Jackedalot123> Ima try fighting Pat again and hopefully there’s no issue
[4:41:17] <fmc009> THE SANDBAG
[4:41:27] <EMP_Ike_Turner> Bustin bustin bustin bustin
[4:41:33] <+NeonTurnip> LUL
[4:41:36] <%TheStarbecue> lend me your sandbag
[4:41:38] <+Anonymasque> @AncelDeLambert I just remember hearing from I think Max or something that your best chance at being good at a game is being there to learn it from day 1 it launches and learning with the community.
[4:41:39] <danknugglit> Raw spirit bomb \ PogChamp /
[4:41:41] <%dking0000> @dao_puppy like he goes from made footsie with st lk and then you pop pipe and the whole match goes nuts
[4:41:45] <Captain_Joe1911> notekBust
[4:41:46] <+Anonymasque> Feels like maybe you miss the bus if your not on it kinda thing..
[4:41:52] <DovaDude29> Boi
[4:41:54] <mikesapartment> Just throw them out as much as possible so you can get a feel for when they work
[4:42:06] <%Nobrev> I still haven't grasped assists at all either
[4:42:08] <Dao_Puppy> Exactly, be lying if I said it wasn't fun then, but it can be rough.
[4:42:16] <$Princepurple8> Anyone ever think about the future of cybernetic prosthetics and they might change E sports or fighting games?
[4:42:23] <%ssjklyco> Pats resting his power level
[4:42:25] <fmc009> @AngriestPat I don't know if you read but, if you would rather have this than lab, you should probably stream more fighting games
[4:42:32] <+badchoice5> How will BussAss know you are letting him have it, and not that he's blowing you out?
[4:42:33] <%TheStarbecue> Comeback?
[4:42:34] <shockmaster3> wait why is pat just sitting there
[4:42:35] <$hatesdps> you didnt win
[4:42:36] <Kalcom> yeah and?
[4:42:39] <AlasterAngelo> @Princepurple8 i think about how cybernetic prosthetics can turn me into a badass all the time
[4:42:39] <danknugglit> Perfect PogChamp LUL
[4:42:41] <+a_deadbeat> Cooler's assist comes out fast, so what you can do is when you're up in the air you can call him and because the camera focuses on the person in the air, your opponent won't see him come out and get hit
[4:42:44] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Rock Lee disagrees
[4:42:47] <Doc1790> Goku giving Pat advice
[4:42:51] <%dking0000> Throwing assists isn’t usually as awful compared to other games because the leave pretty fast
[4:42:58] <RezzyOK> does woolie give good advice on training modde stuff?
[4:43:01] <SeventyForce> Play ace con birb
[4:43:01] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> @Anonymasque The problem is that fighting games arn't fun until you're good at them, and getting good takes a while.
[4:43:08] <%BestTeaMaker> LUL
[4:43:22] <%ThePuddingDead> yeah i think PC version doesnt match up in the same game dude, I'd play ya but...
[4:43:25] <danknugglit> Maybe he closed stream
[4:43:25] <%dking0000> Fighting Games are the WORST genre to jump in and out of
[4:43:26] <fmc009> Lobby reflexes oof
[4:43:28] <moogleboy1984> It's that Saltlord from XIV
[4:43:37] <Kalcom> just play jojo
[4:43:42] <Kalcom> battle royale
[4:43:48] <gazingeye1> ace combat
[4:43:49] <+Maids4lyfe> ff14 saltlord lmao
[4:43:51] <%TheStarbecue> Just possess Woolie's body to learn how to dbfz
[4:43:51] <%dking0000> You can’t drop a fighting game it’s impossible
[4:43:57] <Dao_Puppy> I just want a prosthetic bladder that can hold a few days worth of fluid. It's so troublesome.
[4:44:00] <fmc009> Jojo all star battle Kreygasm
[4:44:03] <%iwishthiswasicq> Yeah, if I stop playing any fighting game for more than like 2 weeks, I lose months of progress.
[4:44:07] <%TheStarbecue> i know yall know basic body possesion
[4:44:19] <+ArcanumMBD> has Pat made any comment on streaming apex?
[4:44:27] <$hatesdps> i want them to install shit eating bacteria inside of me so i never have to poop
[4:44:28] <Ugato> Did... did Goku just say Chungus?
[4:44:36] <Ugato> I swear I heard it
[4:44:37] <%skybriel1> yo, does anybody know if the dmc5 demo is live in the US yet
[4:44:48] <$Princepurple8> Well it's like, if you just got robo hands, even a previous scub could have the potential to be tournament material.
[4:44:58] <%TheStarbecue> Big Chugus WAS created by Toriyama
[4:45:02] <dsauce999> Devil May Pat: V Has Come To
[4:45:08] <%TheStarbecue> so it would make sense
[4:45:12] <moogleboy1984> because Canon
[4:45:19] <fmc009> I feel like to late
[4:45:20] <%dking0000> Imagine the future of eSports with people getting bio implants
[4:45:22] <%iwishthiswasicq> Too late
[4:45:23] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> too middle
[4:45:25] <+LowEnergyStarman> It looked too late
[4:45:26] <+ArcanumMBD> @princepurple8 so you're saying I should make a deal with the Robot Devil?
[4:45:32] <+Anonymasque> @DesuDesuDokiDoki I have been humbled before by fighting games though it's been a long time and I have never really done much online play. I more so meant it feels like you become disadvantaged when you don't keep up to date with the infomation passed around within the FGC of a specific game.
[4:45:33] <%TheStarbecue> too earlate
[4:45:52] <$Princepurple8> @arcanummbd HELL YES I am saying that
[4:46:10] <Ugato> Yes that’s true
[4:46:28] <Chumblago13> goes the matches?

[4:52:21] <+DrunkenDice> if the overhead hits call assist and start the combo
[4:52:38] <%Halowood> 6M > Assist will combo, normally can't get anything off a 6M
[4:52:40] <danknugglit> Im sure he had that mane by coincidence LUL
[4:52:46] <$Princepurple8> !BigRigged
[4:52:50] <TwistedVerse> nah rigged af
[4:52:51] <%BestTeaMaker> @AngriestPat congrats on 1 million twitch views
[4:52:52] <danknugglit> Name
[4:52:52] <%dking0000> Most overheads in this game have a visible leap startup, assist can cover anything during that start up
[4:52:58] <+fugatlas> doing it on hit either a) keeps them in block stun if they block or b) helps keep them there while you recover from the hit connectiong
[4:53:08] <%a_deadbeat> There's a timing where you do the input before the hit the ground and it''l come out as soon as you land
[4:53:16] <tmix1600> The spin brings you to the ground
[4:53:19] <fmc009> @AngriestPat GGs Pat
[4:53:51] <tmix1600> Use armor
[4:53:56] <dimmensional> ki blast
[4:53:59] <eprorkeqardhje> back up and shield up
[4:54:02] <+sunnythedrunk> Use cell on point then
[4:54:03] <%TheStarbecue> i actually have this problem a lot, If you go for standing overhead (6M) you have to let go of forward to get assist to come out to continue combo
[4:54:05] <%iwishthiswasicq> @thewinged7 Woolie has a real good video on it, but a quick answer is to look into Qanba sticks.
[4:54:05] <dsauce999> These Names Tho
[4:54:14] <TwistedVerse> android 21 Kreygasm
[4:54:18] <+fugatlas> do an entire game of all 2H
[4:54:20] <RezzyOK> replace him for someone vanilla with a good assist and throw them in the back?
[4:54:21] <tmix1600> Use Broly armor, build blue health then switch
[4:54:24] <%dking0000> Broly is really unconventional in comparison to other characters
[4:54:26] <+fugatlas> no moving, no jumping, no combo. Just upper cut
[4:54:37] <%a_deadbeat> I subscribed so I could try to help you learn in the discord but I don't know how to get to the discord BibleThump
[4:54:48] <danknugglit> 21 Kreygasm

[4:54:51] <+DrunkenDice> !discord
[4:54:51] <TwistedVerse> 21 hits..
[4:54:53] <StrikeTheGiant> pat already play the dmc 5 demo?
[4:54:54] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Step 1, make a discord
[4:55:03] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Step 2 link to twitch account
[4:55:04] <Kalcom> brain dry
[4:55:08] <%a_deadbeat> I have, and I linked it
[4:55:15] <dsauce999> Step 1: Write all of discord's code.
[4:55:18] <TwistedVerse> @StrikeTheGiant yea
[4:55:20] <thwak> it takes a while for it to link
[4:55:24] <tmix1600> Broly is the big "im coming in ready or not" piece
[4:55:37] <%a_deadbeat> okay, cool lol. Thought something was wrong
[4:55:44] <Ugato> I’m pretty sure Pat isn’t even half as desiring of getting good at this game as the people who are talking about it in chat
[4:56:14] <%thewinged7> @iwishthiswasicq ive looked at Qanba sticks, but you just cant realy get them here without paying ~$300+ aussie dollarydoos
[4:56:14] <Run44forrest> ghost of combos dropped is a pretty good name
[4:56:26] <cool_culainn> Thanks
[4:56:28] <tmix1600> Im want him to succeed thought
[4:56:29] <fmc009> @AngriestPat Since you aren't gonna lab, one of the best Broly players plays Broly and Goku as an assist, because they synergize really well, including leading to combos after super. Maybe try that on your own time. See if you like it.
[4:56:54] <%thewinged7> only real option here is "Real Arcade" sticks
[4:56:59] <artoflec> this game always seemed a bit frustrating but it looks super hype LUL
[4:57:03] <fmc009> SSJ Goku to specific
[4:57:11] <%a_deadbeat> you did it!
[4:57:14] <TwistedVerse> now hes gonna grind off screen @fmc009 gottemm
[4:57:17] <alwayspronking> he did it!
[4:57:27] <fmc009> @TwistedVerse Kappa
[4:57:29] <alwayspronking> \ PogChamp /
[4:57:35] <%dking0000> @ugato probably not, but I think it’s pretty generally thought that low levels suck because you don’t know what to do fundamentally
[4:57:40] <tmix1600> All fighting games are frustrating when you cant play
[4:57:49] <Ugato> I’m sure he’d like to be good at the game, but he’s more interested in playing all the shit people like. And there’s plenty of times he’s just going to drop this for other stuff as it comes out
[4:57:54] <Run44forrest> oh yeah beam assists are great you should try and incorporate one of the into your team pat
[4:57:58] <%luftraumm1> @angriestpat yo, remember to have fun, do combo! cya
[4:57:59] <chester804> @AngriestPat Pat do you think maybe playing players your level in ranked might help you more then people on the stream?
[4:58:05] <NicholasKane> @AngriestPat The idea behind "use your assist every time you throw out an overhead" is that your assist will continue the blockstring even though your overhead is unsafe. Your assist's hits need to collide porperly after your own hits, right? So what you have to do is, press the button at a specific timing either before or after you input the overhead, depending on the startup of the assist and the startup of the overhead.
[4:58:08] <%TheStarbecue> Pat will only improve if he plays the entire story mode on stream no bathroom breaks
[4:58:11] <+phatmac16> Lol
[4:58:13] <+DrunkenDice> meg
[4:58:14] <%a_deadbeat> Cell doesn't count, no
[4:58:17] <+DrunkenDice> meh*
[4:58:18] <fmc009> Cell kinda counts but not really no
[4:58:19] <%Hilleltaco> His is weird and diagonal
[4:58:21] <dimmensional> not as good as gokus
[4:58:21] <%BestTeaMaker> horizontal beams
[4:58:22] <exalt4747> I wish Cell counted
[4:58:26] <tmix1600> Cell is a werid beam
[4:58:27] <%iwishthiswasicq> @thewinged7 Well, see how cheap getting parts would be. Even the shittiest stick can be made decent if you replace the actual stick and buttons
[4:58:30] <artoflec> how many more gokus do you want in this game
[4:58:36] <TwistedVerse> @TheStarbecue not if he keeps drinking that many energy drinks
[4:58:39] <TwistedVerse> :P
[4:58:39] <%a_deadbeat> If Cell had a true beam assist I'd cream my jeans
[4:58:44] <cool_culainn> Gg Patrick
[4:58:45] <exalt4747> I want a beam assist but I keep not wanting the characters that get them
[4:58:45] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat I need sleep. Good bye.
[4:58:47] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @thewinged7 This is very second hand information. But I heard if you're building a stick, look for the brand Sanwa nearly exclusively.
[4:58:48] <+TheHeroAppears> @artoflec 25% of the roster
[4:58:48] <fmc009> 2 Brolys Kreygasm
[4:58:49] <TheShockVox> I just want blue gi end of Z Goku.
[4:59:01] <%dking0000> A “true” beam assist covers a lot of the screen
[4:59:01] <Ugato> Putting in a lot of work seems counter-intuitive when he’s just going to drop it for a few weeks or months and just get rusty again, is all I’m saying.
[4:59:08] <TheShockVox> It’s like games Toei HATES that Goku design
[4:59:14] <tmix1600> Cell's assist can work as any othe beam when close
[4:59:17] <TheShockVox> It’s been in like only 3 games
[4:59:18] <$Princepurple8> So when is the dmcv demon avalible?
[4:59:19] <Gogie420> start doing a combo, heavy them down + assist
[4:59:20] <TwistedVerse> nice
[4:59:23] <%TheStarbecue> @TwistedVerse yea, idk why Pat keeps converting energy drink into pee, convert into energy thats what theyre for
[4:59:24] <%AncelDeLambert> baited
[4:59:24] <Quabadaba> welp
[4:59:30] <$Princepurple8> Demo**
[4:59:42] <TwistedVerse> @TheStarbecue ikr LUL
[4:59:46] <NicholasKane> So, since you knocked the opoonent down and they slid away, which caused Cell to miss, you have to call Cell's assist way earlier in the exchange
[4:59:49] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 5 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 20oz (600mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[4:59:51] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@fmc009) (warning)
[4:59:55] <ebonifragaria> @TheStarbecue His system must become so efficient that he pees only light
[5:00:07] <fmc009> I forgot Hit was in the game
[5:00:11] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat's learndning
[5:00:13] <Gogie420> also dont forget to tag out
[5:00:14] <dsauce999> STAR PISS
[5:00:19] <%thewinged7> yeah hori buttons are about $2 a pop, and a sanwa stick is arround $36 here
[5:00:19] <artoflec> I want Goku in that suit the aliens gave him when he learned instant transmission, kid goku, red goku, white goku, baby goku crying in a saiyan ship, goku with a saiyan scouter

[5:00:50] <+NovaTera> couldnt we just have goku and kid goku then call it a day, do we really need 30 gokus
[5:00:54] <%dking0000> Crying Goku v Broly is a 10-0 matchup
[5:00:55] <CatsEyeBlind> GT Kid Goku

[5:01:10] <dsauce999> RAW SUPES
[5:01:11] <%AncelDeLambert> oh SNAP
[5:01:13] <NicholasKane> @AngriestPat It is very important to know that you can call your assist two or even three moves before you need the move to come out, so that their startup matches up with the combo ender / overhead / dunk / whatever you need the assist to catch.
[5:01:14] <The_500lb_Child> Dont forget SSJ4 Goku Kappa
[5:01:15] <%ghostfarts315> Nice
[5:01:15] <TwistedVerse> and all the gokus are equally dopes
[5:01:22] <%TheStarbecue> @AngriestPat Cell's teleport move has three hits, idk if you want just the two or not
[5:01:23] <darthkickass> how much longer till the demo drops?
[5:01:25] <artoflec> @The_500lb_Child that's not my goku DansGame

[5:01:42] <%ghostfarts315> @AngriestPat well I need sleep. good night, your doing good.
[5:01:45] <%dking0000> When’s Dragonball Goku with his stick?
[5:01:45] <TwistedVerse> LUL @spiegelspike
[5:01:45] <fmc009> Yes it does
[5:01:49] <exalt4747> What has three hits?
[5:01:52] <Ugato> you can’t just have kid goku and goku
[5:01:54] <$Princepurple8> I unironcally think ss4 vegeta would be great.
[5:01:57] <%TheStarbecue> @AngriestPat ye, just hit button again
[5:02:01] <artoflec> superhuman water goku
[5:02:02] <%a_deadbeat> qcb+button has three hits on the ground, or the ex version
[5:02:03] <thejarman> grounded it does
[5:02:07] <+fugatlas> "team reanimated"
[5:02:10] <Ugato> What about Dark Goku? and Toon Goku?
[5:02:13] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Demo should be out in Central and Eastern time
[5:02:13] <fmc009> SSJ4 Kreygasm
[5:02:17] <artoflec> god that arc with the purple slime bois was the most filler shit in the universe
[5:02:27] <+Bloodxb> the issue is that ssj4 adds gt to the can of worms
[5:02:28] <Gogie420> now heavy them to send them down plus do the assidt
[5:02:30] <TwistedVerse> what if all past present and future gokus fused... :LLLLL
[5:02:31] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> maybe Mountain time in a few minutes
[5:02:32] <The_500lb_Child> Toon Goku can only be summoned when Toon World is on the field.
[5:02:34] <danknugglit> What about grandma goku LUL
[5:02:39] <fmc009> That kinda works
[5:02:44] <%dking0000> Remember that part of GT were they had to stop dancing to win?
[5:02:52] <TwistedVerse> whUt
[5:02:56] <+fugatlas> is there an embargo on streaming the demo? Easy Allies are kinda just dicking around for now, implying there is one keeping them from playing
[5:02:57] <artoflec> wtf is toon goku
[5:03:05] <fmc009> Yamcha is legit good
[5:03:20] <TwistedVerse> yeaaaa whoop krillin's ass, kill him again

[5:03:31] <dsauce999> You Summon Goku but apply the Toon World Card to him
[5:03:34] <tmix1600> Broly's
[5:03:35] <Ugato> It’s a smash brothers joke
[5:03:36] <%Hilleltaco> Doesn't Cell's 214 automatically do the extra hits though? It just only does 2 in the air
[5:03:36] <fmc009> @AngriestPat Cell's Heavy is one of the non standard ones
[5:03:37] <Gogie420> hit t
[5:03:42] <%laserbeaming> Still live? That's a lot of Dragon Ball
[5:03:44] <TwistedVerse> @Ugato oohhh
[5:03:46] <+fugatlas> wake up supers: they feel great when you block them, and make you feel like a scrub when they connect
[5:03:49] <%a_deadbeat> all your characters are nonstandard. Cooler and Cell's air 2H goes sideways, not up
[5:03:55] <Gogie420> hit the heavy button in the air to send them down
[5:03:56] <alwayspronking> chat is full of liars and masters
[5:04:02] <Ugato> Since there’s 4 f’ing Links
[5:04:06] <%Implosivestar> @AngriestPat Would you consider yourself a reactive type or a lab type of player?
[5:04:07] <%a_deadbeat> Broly's air 2H doesn't connect unless you're in the corner
[5:04:08] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Masters of Lying

[5:05:51] <$Mendin> solo brolo
[5:05:54] <TheShockVox> Hes the 2 btw
[5:05:54] <fmc009> Can't you 1v1 on the weird cup mode???
[5:05:58] <NicholasKane> @AngriestPat Have you ever tried party battles?
[5:06:00] <tmix1600> If it was solo it would be P4A
[5:06:00] <%crimsonharvest> good job fighter
[5:06:03] <ebonifragaria> So like.. if my PC was middling-low tier about 4 years ago, how much would I need to upgrade it to play DMC5? Should I just get a PS4?
[5:06:07] <+fugatlas> I feel bad that the mode where a different player controls all 3 characters didn't get more ground swell
[5:06:14] <+fugatlas> Max's streams of that mode were awesome
[5:06:14] <Neo_Kaiser> So why does Pat think he's not good enough for Evo?
[5:06:15] <thejarman> better broly combos are super reliant on assist synergy, it's why he isn't considered all that good
[5:06:15] <Gogie420> in the air

[5:06:22] <dsauce999> A battle where you party
[5:06:28] <NicholasKane> @AngriestPat Party Battle is a mode where you team up with two other players, and each of you controls one character.
[5:06:29] <xiccy> 6 people play each character
[5:06:31] <Run44forrest> 6 players every player gets one character
[5:06:36] <TheShockVox> A battle where it’s 3 players vs 3
[5:06:36] <fmc009> @AngriestPat Party Battle everyone uses only one character. it's 3v3 with 6 people total.
[5:06:37] <danknugglit> Its a battle with coke and strippers
[5:06:39] <%laserbeaming> Battle Hard, Party Hard
[5:06:42] <TwistedVerse> dayum
[5:06:43] <swift_malachi> @AngriestPat It'sa mode where 6 people all play in the same round. One character each

[5:11:53] <fmc009> Tag out
[5:12:31] <%a_deadbeat> Generally speaking, if you have the meter and are switching out a character, you should end in a level 3 so you can get a hard knockdown
[5:12:32] <%laserbeaming> Yay, violence!
[5:12:33] <TwistedVerse> :L

[5:12:46] <%TheStarbecue> @AngriestPat Broly's 214S is his barrier, protects against S attacks. A lot of ppl use it after the throw down in his air combo because you kinda just have free time until you hit ground.

[5:13:29] <%Implosivestar> I'm always surprised by how good at fighting games Pat is when he doesn't have to go against Woolie apatJpeg
[5:13:34] <fmc009> this cornflakes be og
[5:13:38] <+Bloodxb> "you only made me use 10% of my power Eugene"
[5:13:39] <%a_deadbeat> Broly and Cell's level 3 are very easy to DHC into, Cooler's is finicky
[5:13:39] <%TempestaDePrimo> the fuk pat
[5:13:48] <%TheStarbecue> Woolie's never even played a fighting game
[5:13:52] <TheShockVox> @implosivestar I’d say he’s probably better when he plays Woolie
[5:13:54] <TwistedVerse> never ever
[5:14:03] <+Promessa_EX> what is ff14 starter edition
[5:14:11] <%dking0000> Woolie relys on his boss characters
[5:14:27] <+Bloodxb> base ff14 for a month @promessa_ex
[5:14:30] <TwistedVerse> F
[5:14:30] <NicholasKane> has woolie ever even played a videogame before
[5:14:33] <%TheStarbecue> If you like character, just play them and pair them with yamcha kek
[5:14:33] <%Implosivestar> Woolie also steals pies though what am I saying
[5:14:35] <tmix1600> Pick who you want and work from there is what I do
[5:14:38] <Gogie420> dat superdash tho
[5:14:39] <dimmensional> find a point that you like and build a team around him/her @AngriestPat
[5:14:45] <+Promessa_EX> @Bloodxb neato
[5:14:54] <fmc009> @AngriestPat I had the same problem, but certain characters it's easy. If you are lost just pick someone you really like, ssj goku and vegeta. almost always works. But to find a good team on what you like can be tough
[5:14:57] <Vigonept> Come back incoming
[5:14:58] <%Hilleltaco> Does Broly's jab even hit Vegeta?
[5:15:03] <%dking0000> Wasn’t Woolie’s original team Gohan 16 Hit? Some of the thought to be best characters at start?
[5:15:09] <TheShockVox> I’m with Pat, never been an assist guy in fighting games. My enjoyment from MvC was always the gimmick itself and playing like it was street fighter, but with switching out, assists are lame to me
[5:15:10] <McAngrimStein> Being a manlet finally pays off for Vegeta
[5:15:11] <+Bloodxb> then you leanred you dont like them
[5:15:13] <gottigotbundles> what's the invite to the discord?
[5:15:13] <TwistedVerse> dont defeat woolie in 2s tho, he'll reset the game >:L
[5:15:16] <+DrunkenDice> Pat then learn with losers and then you'll know what to change
[5:15:17] <%a_deadbeat> Playing a team game is weird because you have to decide what you value more: playing 3 characters you like or playing 1 to 2 extremely effectively because the third character has a good assist for them
[5:15:17] <fmc009> this dude is going for the loops Kappa
[5:15:18] <RezzyOK> just pick one person with a good assist and two you like, youll be fine that way
[5:15:19] <dimmensional> Everyone in this game is usable if you lab
[5:15:20] <%GingaNZ> if who you like is the concern then just play who you like
[5:15:24] <Yeajow> You'll like at least one
[5:15:25] <Ugato> Them’s the breaks in video games
[5:15:28] <ScreamingMeat> DAM UUUUU
[5:15:37] <tmix1600> If you like a character enough, you make it work
[5:15:39] <Cardboard96> Cell still sounds like fucking plankton to me in this game
[5:15:46] <tmix1600> Like marriage
[5:15:46] <TwistedVerse> correct
[5:15:49] <swift_malachi> @AngriestPat fuck assist synergy. Pick fun shit
[5:15:52] <Ugato> Sometimes you have to play shitters to be cool
[5:15:57] <%TheStarbecue> Challenge Max on stream right now, you can take him
[5:15:59] <fmc009> Yes that's how it be
[5:16:00] <%dking0000> It’s best to just find who you like and then place them via point mid anchor
[5:16:01] <Ugato> Or play dorks to be good
[5:16:04] <%GingaNZ> yeah so just play who you like if thats what matters to you
[5:16:07] <fmc009> Oh shit my turn xD
[5:16:11] <+DrunkenDice> Then keep the point and change the other 2
[5:16:11] <+Bloodxb> sometimes ot be like that
[5:16:13] <RezzyOK> like 1 AND 2, you can feel despair when 3 comes in
[5:16:14] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Who plays like that
[5:16:15] <TwistedVerse> true pros play shit fighters, and win with those to boot
[5:16:15] <ScreamingMeat> Why not play story mode for a while?
[5:16:16] <%laserbeaming> Looking at you Vegeta Kappa
[5:16:17] <+Rolandknight> he's getting tired
[5:16:19] <%PaladinDupre> YOU'LL LEARN to LOVE THEM
[5:16:19] <Phalanx_Soul> at least 33.3 percent of your team will be awesome?
[5:16:27] <thwak> that's pretty much how mvc2 worked out, people just gave up when it got to psylocke or captain commando
[5:16:32] <+Promessa_EX> is that bussass
[5:16:36] <%a_deadbeat> I totally get you. I felt the same way, but I've come to love SSJ Goku even if I originally picked him only for his assist synergy with Broly
[5:16:40] <RezzyOK> brolly is a punching bag
[5:16:56] <%laserbeaming> Brolly is really easy to hit
[5:16:57] <%calvarok> why broly aint got a neck
[5:16:57] <%TheStarbecue> Broly is secretly a huge bitch
[5:16:58] <Twoiis> Pretty sure everyone has the same life.
[5:16:58] <Gogie420> you got hit by sweep starter. that hurts alot
[5:17:01] <%TheStarbecue> and a sub
[5:17:01] <+NovaTera> i started with Cell, Kid Buu and Piccolo
[5:17:02] <TwistedVerse> broly tHICC
[5:17:03] <Sokumotanaka> can you put broly and...broly(tm) on a team?
[5:17:03] <%GingaNZ> no extra HP for being big in DBZ
[5:17:06] <tmix1600> People rush Broly out of fear
[5:17:11] <%dking0000> You REALLY need to snowball to get Broly going
[5:17:17] <danknugglit> Broly, his power MAXIMUM. Killed by a 12 year old
[5:17:17] <%Hilleltaco> Everyone has the same health, Broly's just easy to hit I guess
[5:17:19] <+Bloodxb> yes you will be able to use both brolys
[5:17:22] <Gogie420> also your uppercut completly missed
[5:17:29] <ScreamingMeat> Well if you remember. His power is SOOOO MAXIMUM that he is basically a Ki Baloon. And if you hurt him he'll explode
[5:17:33] <Gogie420> eduard9Picgun
[5:17:37] <exalt4747> If you can have three gokus or Vegetas
[5:17:40] <exalt4747> You can have two Brolys
[5:17:52] <tmix1600> Broly/Broly/Kefla
[5:17:54] <%laserbeaming> They should put Bio Broly in. If you can have a team of Gokus, having a team of Broly is only fair
[5:18:04] <Sokumotanaka> @exalt4747 Hi...larious
[5:18:07] <%dking0000> How would Super Broly play? Like is he just gonna be Broly again?
[5:18:09] <TwistedVerse> man those animations sure lookin guilty gear-ish
[5:18:10] <+Promessa_EX> it's canon broly explodes if you punch him in the gut hard enough
[5:18:12] <exalt4747> Hmm?
[5:18:24] <Flyrant> nobody knows how super broly will play
[5:18:27] <%TheStarbecue> Broly Super is gonna play like Bedman
[5:18:33] <%TheStarbecue> confirmed
[5:18:37] <%calvarok> why is the small blonde man killing the devil
[5:18:40] <exalt4747> I just hope new Broly is fun tbh
[5:18:43] <junglist_760> hes butt raping you man...
[5:18:44] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> LUL
[5:18:45] <%laserbeaming> Super Broly is gonna play like Bridget
[5:18:47] <tmix1600> Super Broly i assume will be more Ki based
[5:18:48] <TwistedVerse> guilty dragon ball gear fighterZ
[5:18:50] <%GingaNZ> GO TO TRAINING MODE
[5:18:52] <Flyrant> because you are bad pat
[5:18:52] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> HOW CAN THIS BE
[5:18:53] <%Hilleltaco> do input good
[5:18:54] <moogleboy1984> How can this bee?
[5:18:55] <dimmensional> dont build around that character just for the assist. many assist do pretty much the same so you have options.
[5:18:56] <%GingaNZ> learn something
[5:19:00] <Sokumotanaka> I just want my guy tapion and pikkon
[5:19:00] <+badchoice5> Salt gumming up your pad?
[5:19:02] <%dking0000> I’d love it if new Broly is a hybrid grappler
[5:19:05] <exalt4747> Wow, team white boys
[5:19:05] <NicholasKane> @AngriestPat So what you do is, first you try out every character in an anchor context (i.e. without an assist), and you cross off all the characters you don't like the normals and specials of. Then you take that list, and you learn the properties (startup, stun duration, hitbox, knockback) of every assist on that list. Then, you look at every character on your list that you say "man i wish i could assist right here" and just pick which assist does what you want.
[5:19:07] <McAngrimStein> shut up Gohan
[5:19:12] <fmc009> @AngriestPat I'm gonna leave the lobby now. Thanks for the games Pat.
[5:19:15] <%LocoCrazy_> Look at that boy band shit
[5:19:17] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> 200 word essay
[5:19:17] <%TIME_PUNCHER> @AngriestPat With assists, sounds like a fashion frame problem. You KNOW you like Inaros, but you're picking the rest of the squad too. So it becomes a question of fashion Vs. function.
[5:19:19] <thejarman> so the rules on that are really fucking arbitrary
[5:19:22] <+austinlamode> Lol it’s okay bud.
[5:19:25] <TwistedVerse> ah the ol aryan team
[5:19:30] <+TallYoda08> Gohan is the best
[5:19:35] <tmix1600> Regular Broly is a hybrid grappler lol
[5:19:41] <TwistedVerse> blond, white, white robes
[5:19:42] <%TheStarbecue> to hit Cooler's LVL3 in the air DONT hit the button after knee that does the smack down, cancel that into LVL3
[5:19:43] <Flyrant> man nice essay
[5:19:43] <Ugato> This sounds a lot like homework
[5:19:45] <junglist_760> nahh just have fun and play... itll all come natural
[5:19:50] <nepwar> ,
[5:19:52] <fmc009> Discord please help pat
[5:19:58] <Futurecity10> its almost like its a mistake to try and play a fighting game for fun
[5:20:02] <majindusto> STILL UP?
[5:20:05] <%ThePuddingDead> i wish we could choose the assists they do like mvc 2
[5:20:15] <Ugato> A rousing endorsement of fighting games
[5:20:18] <%ThePuddingDead> that way u wont feel left behind and still work chars u love in ur team
[5:20:20] <exalt4747> mvc2 had that?
[5:20:21] <TheShockVox> Almost my turn, hope he at least does one more
[5:20:22] <ScreamingMeat> God the animation is SO GOOD!
[5:20:24] <Flyrant> that's been something people have wanted for a while.
[5:20:25] <junglist_760> i mean to you but at the end of the day its just a game
[5:20:43] <%dking0000> Skullgirls is the one game where assists felt natural to me
[5:20:45] <%ThePuddingDead> @exalt4747 oh yeah, each char from that huge roster could have 3 choices of asists
[5:20:50] <exalt4747> Damn.
[5:20:56] <%ThePuddingDead> Skullgirls is another good example
[5:20:59] <TwistedVerse> videl woooo
[5:21:04] <Sokumotanaka> Arksys really needs to make that jojo x persona fighter so I can die happy
[5:21:05] <TwistedVerse> F
[5:21:06] <%ThePuddingDead> and that one u can MAKE your own assits
[5:21:10] <danknugglit> This game looks so pretty its not fare to other fighting games
[5:21:11] <exalt4747> I played some mv2 at like, my stepdad's friends house once but I didn't know that was a thing
[5:21:13] <%laserbeaming> My team is 21, Broly and Yamcha. I eventually figured out how to make the assists work. Might've been lucky though
[5:21:13] <junglist_760> kick her in the front butt
[5:21:23] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> I have yet to see a short hair Videl today. FeelsGoodMan
[5:21:25] <Flyrant> I just wish this game had more playstyle variety, some zoning or trap characters would be nice
[5:21:26] <TheShockVox> Why not play third strike?
[5:21:29] <%ThePuddingDead> mvc2 was fantastic, just really shit sound design :P
[5:21:30] <TwistedVerse> videl a BEAST
[5:21:32] <%TheStarbecue> Leave my baby alone Pat
[5:21:32] <tmix1600> Is nobody new coming or are people not leaving?
[5:21:45] <%VanaSkiller> @Sphincter_Spelunker woopsKek
[5:21:45] <%LocoCrazy_> Holy ball bags I'm getting the johns from watching that
[5:21:53] <%laserbeaming> You should play Under Night In Birth instead Kappa
[5:21:55] <danknugglit> Videl, her power is MAXIMUM
[5:21:57] <%ThePuddingDead> @AngriestPat Oh yeah Pat, give Videl a try! She's a half grappler with wrestling moves!
[5:22:01] <%calvarok> wait how is videl clashing with people
[5:22:01] <Flyrant> UNIEL Kreygasm
[5:22:04] <gottigotbundles> no one new there like 9 people in lobby
[5:22:04] <%GingaNZ> honestly did pretty good against a pink square rank
[5:22:07] <ogcornflakes> oof
[5:22:07] <King___Crimson> Videl doin to Pat what Spopavich did to her
[5:22:09] <%TheStarbecue> @AngriestPat to hit Cooler's LVL3 in the air DONT hit the button after knee that does the smack down, cancel that into LVL3
[5:22:12] <g_dondo> @AngriestPat what characters do you like?
[5:22:18] <NicholasKane> @AngriestPat Well, like, say you've decided that you want to be able to, as Broly, knock the opponent down from the air to the ground, fast fall, run forward, then continue hitting the opponent. There's a specific hitbox, range, and stun length that lets you do that, and you would have to find a character that you like playing as, who has an assist that does that. In this context, it would most likely be something like Gold Vegeta.
[5:22:21] <%ThePuddingDead> but she has lots of grapples tho
[5:22:22] <+austinlamode> Does pat have a basic comprehension of universal punishes and bnbs for the characters he’s using?
[5:22:26] <%Implosivestar> That shade
[5:22:30] <Gogie420> lol Mr satan

[5:23:18] <danknugglit> Mr satan is the strongest in the universe his power is MAXIMUM
[5:23:20] <%ThePuddingDead> that goku black arc was fuckin abyssmal
[5:23:20] <TwistedVerse> super duper sayainZ
[5:23:21] <%ThePuddingDead> imo
[5:23:22] <%Plague_Nurse> It's not worth a watch
[5:23:22] <Gogie420> oh boy super sash eduard9Mashin
[5:23:22] <%TIME_PUNCHER> Come again?
[5:23:23] <%D_day> fake fan Kappa
[5:23:24] <Neo_Kaiser> Pats a fake fan! Fraud detected!
[5:23:25] <+DrunkenDice> What happened to your child pat psykenHuh
[5:23:25] <Luesagna00> wtf did goku mean by that? "ur pretty strong for mr satan daughter. i better train hard not to lose to gohan"
[5:23:26] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> SSJ Goku, Blue Goku, Goku Rose, Base Goku, Vegito, (Zamasu fused technically)
[5:23:26] <+Promessa_EX> + filler guide or something for super
[5:23:27] <Sokumotanaka> super is eh, introduced too many waifus I'm mad aren't returning
[5:23:27] <junglist_760> then log off and watch dragonball maybe then will you be able to achieve their full potential
[5:23:31] <%Implosivestar> apatMenace
[5:23:33] <%TIME_PUNCHER> Wow
[5:23:36] <tmix1600> I hate how close your exaggeration was. There are 4 gokus.....
[5:23:41] <exalt4747> Black and Zamasu were cool, but the arc itself could be shit outside the fights
[5:23:43] <%TIME_PUNCHER> Pat watched HxH before Dragon Ball
[5:23:46] <Gogie420> super dash DoritosChip
[5:23:49] <junglist_760> down heavy
[5:23:56] <wondersloth07> i want dragon ball gt characters because their designs are amazing
[5:24:01] <ebonifragaria> All I know about DBZ comes from the Abridged series
[5:24:03] <TwistedVerse> literally oops all the same character with different hair colors
[5:24:04] <%calvarok> apatMenace apatMenace apatLiz apatMenace apatMenace
[5:24:05] <junglist_760> button mash
[5:24:05] <+badchoice5> HxH was a spite watch tho
[5:24:13] <exalt4747> He liked it by the end
[5:24:14] <TwistedVerse> whUt
[5:24:16] <ScreamingMeat> I'm so glade Broly says more than "KAKAROT!" in this game. In all the other DBZ games he's in that's the only word he knows
[5:24:18] <RickieCheese> cmon pat, i told my friends you were cool. now youre saying you cant pick a team because your point might die and you havent watched dragon ball. youre making me look bad man
[5:24:19] <%laserbeaming> @ebonifragaria you got the better version then
[5:24:21] <exalt4747> He praised the heck out of Chimera ant
[5:24:24] <%ThePuddingDead> zamasu had the weakest motivations compared to other enemies in the franchise
[5:24:24] <%TheFilth> Are ya winning son?
[5:24:31] <%ThePuddingDead> he was just crazy
[5:24:33] <+Promessa_EX> the logos on the gi are different too
[5:24:33] <exalt4747> How?
[5:24:38] <junglist_760> what console?
[5:24:39] <Gogie420> oh boy more superdash DoritosChip
[5:24:42] <exalt4747> What are Frieza, Cell, etcs motivations?
[5:24:58] <danknugglit> Moms spaghetti
[5:24:58] <TwistedVerse> nice
[5:25:05] <Ugato> Noice
[5:25:19] <TwistedVerse> dayum
[5:25:22] <%TheStarbecue> ayyyy
[5:25:27] <Ugato> Full screen footsies didn’t you know
[5:25:28] <KeiPrime> whooOAAOoaoaoaoaoaooo
[5:25:31] <Hammerknife> isn't it super cold in montreal right now
[5:25:42] <%TheStarbecue> Goku sounds like a Sonic
[5:25:42] <Sielas> imagine playing 3 gokus
[5:25:42] <tmix1600> Cell is just a whiny goku
[5:25:44] <TwistedVerse> one super sandwich left
[5:25:49] <danknugglit> The comeback \ PogChamp /
[5:25:53] <%ThePuddingDead> Frieza was a power hungry megalomaniac who thought he conquered the universe; a tyrant. Cell just did what he did to achieve his perfect form and wanted to wipe out planets for the lolz
[5:25:55] <TheShockVox> Good game Pat
[5:25:56] <TwistedVerse> weLP
[5:26:02] <TheShockVox> 2 - 2
[5:26:05] <Ugato> Good match
[5:26:06] <$MajorCrasher> just watch DBZA @angriestpat
[5:26:07] <danknugglit> So close
[5:26:15] <%TheStarbecue> Just watch GT
[5:26:15] <TwistedVerse> big whiffs
[5:26:17] <%calvarok> i really love that the villain in the opening scene of one punch man looks like a dragonball
[5:26:17] <%GingaNZ> if you see a super flash mash on vanish, it sometimes will save you
[5:26:18] <%Mikatonic> can anyone join?
[5:26:18] <majindusto> So Pat will spite watch HxH...But won't even wantch any Dragon Ball? lol
[5:26:26] <junglist_760> i believed in you until he hit you with that level 3...
[5:26:27] <+VelvetRobot> those pecs
[5:26:34] <majindusto> "watch"
[5:26:34] <%ThePuddingDead> Buu and the incarnations of him were just an outta control monster
[5:26:35] <exalt4747> There are way more DB episodes than hxh
[5:26:41] <exalt4747> It's more than double the size
[5:26:42] <+badchoice5> Wait, I thought Pat watched DBZ but not Super?
[5:26:44] <exalt4747> granted, there's Kai but
[5:26:46] <junglist_760> what console?
[5:26:51] <%TheStarbecue> DBZ is not worth watch tbh
[5:27:01] <%Trinity5> did pat read dbz?
[5:27:01] <+DrunkenDice> ^ ???
[5:27:03] <$MajorCrasher> Frieda is not the middle
[5:27:05] <RezzyOK> lol
[5:27:06] <+mmSoTasty> LUL
[5:27:09] <junglist_760> we have the internet... catch up bro...
[5:27:09] <%Mikatonic> @junglist_760 ps4
[5:27:12] <%TheStarbecue> Shit;s a slog. a slog that i love, but a slog
[5:27:14] <Hammerknife> you dont have to really watch dbz to figure out pretty much everything that happens and why
[5:27:15] <%Hilleltaco> I'm a similar huge fraud
[5:27:16] <TwistedVerse> so you got to see gorilla goku :L
[5:27:16] <+Maids4lyfe> that's completely fair
[5:27:17] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Abridged my dude
[5:27:17] <majindusto> FRAUD
[5:27:25] <Flyrant> just watch up to the end of Namek saga
[5:27:26] <tmix1600> Super is worth watching, Z ehhh
[5:27:27] <TheShockVox> This is the biggest reveal ever
[5:27:27] <DatGreyMind> DansGame DBZ Kai? Slow?
[5:27:28] <ScreamingMeat> Beef vs Beef
[5:27:28] <%ThePuddingDead> thats weird cuz kai was almost an abridged version
[5:27:28] <%Hilleltaco> I've never watched it but I can kinda talk to people about it
[5:27:29] <%VanaSkiller> fake faaaaan
[5:27:29] <+Promessa_EX> everone started dragonball from the middle
[5:27:31] <+badchoice5> Yeah...Super isn't really any faster
[5:27:31] <%ThePuddingDead> "almost"
[5:27:32] <Ugato> Abridged is worth the watch at least
[5:27:33] <%laserbeaming> Honestly Pat, you didn't miss that much.
[5:27:35] <NicholasKane> the problem with abridged is that a lot of the jokes require prior knowledge
[5:27:39] <+VelvetRobot> two UNITS
[5:27:40] <GameOver_Here> Pat confirmed fake DBZ fan.
[5:27:41] <NicholasKane> like "cat loves food" and shit
[5:27:45] <TwistedVerse> swole bois
[5:27:46] <%ThePuddingDead> dbza did a great job of the series tho
[5:27:47] <+DrunkenDice> dbz as an adult must be painful. 30 episodes of talking before an actually fight starts
[5:27:49] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Pat just said he had prior knowledge
[5:27:50] <%LixFury> the abridged is faster and funy LUL
[5:27:53] <majindusto> KAI? SLOW?
[5:27:55] <Hammerknife> i mean everyone 'starts' dragonball from the middle since the very first episode goku and gohan show up at roshi's house
[5:27:58] <Neo_Kaiser> How late is Pat going for?
[5:28:06] <Flyrant> Abridged is amazing
[5:28:10] <Hammerknife> and if you never watch the original dragonball you pretty much go in blind
[5:28:10] <%lazysaiyajin> manga is short. read that instead, toriyama has excellent use of panels and page turn
[5:28:14] <exalt4747> Vegeta
[5:28:16] <exalt4747> I CAN FLY
[5:28:17] <GameOver_Here> Just watch abridged
[5:28:19] <TwistedVerse> more like Swoly
[5:28:20] <+NovaTera> pat confirmed to have saved a lot of time
[5:28:22] <ScreamingMeat> What do the Dragon Balls even do in this game?
[5:28:24] <Futurecity10> @AngriestPat Havent you seen all of DBZ abridged? If so you've seen dragonball z
[5:28:24] <DojimaDetective> @Hammerknife Pretty sure that's dragon ball z.
[5:28:30] <TheShockVox> I feel how Woolie felt when he found out Pat didn’t play much street fighter outside of Alpha 3
[5:28:35] <dimmensional> light and medium
[5:28:36] <%ThePuddingDead> im not sure, i didnt buy him
[5:28:37] <majindusto> Motions
[5:28:38] <+badchoice5> Quantum uncertainty principle
[5:28:39] <danknugglit> It just works
[5:28:39] <%bestwaifuritsu> because his numbers are apatBig
[5:28:40] <%TheStarbecue> broly just takesit to the face... like a man
[5:28:41] <Hammerknife> @DojimaDetective yeah thats what i mean. the anime just sort of plops you into the first saga
[5:28:48] <nina9669> wow
[5:28:48] <TheShockVox> Because. He’s a terrible character that Toriyama had to save
[5:28:53] <dimmensional> what do you mean then
[5:28:55] <tmix1600> Air
[5:28:57] <Rikui_> depends on the height
[5:28:58] <DojimaDetective> Yeah, but Dragonball starts at a decent spot to build context
[5:28:58] <%laserbeaming> You mean with the air grab?
[5:29:06] <somesidecharacter> light version and medium version
[5:29:09] <Hammerknife> not really much of an intro to anything you just grab and go, which is fine when its a show for little kids
[5:29:10] <Sokumotanaka> Chat only answer if you know
[5:29:11] <%ThePuddingDead> and if im not mistaken pat, yeah I "think" broly does take more damage and that super armor i guess was their way of balancing him out
[5:29:15] <%LocoCrazy_> super helpful non answers.
[5:29:21] <g_dondo> @AngriestPat its because he only slams them if you used his 2h on the ground to launch them
[5:29:22] <dimmensional> it depends if you down heavy
[5:29:22] <+badchoice5> Sweet spot?
[5:29:25] <TwistedVerse> ds lite vs ds phat
[5:29:35] <%ThePuddingDead> there ya go
[5:29:38] <gottigotbundles> it's the smash attack
[5:29:38] <dimmensional> if you down heavy he choke slams if not he just huits
[5:29:39] <majindusto> Dunk vs Throw?
[5:29:39] <$ThirdStrike_Alex> down heavy
[5:29:39] <%TheStarbecue> AYYYY
[5:29:40] <+DrunkenDice> That just the last hit of the L auto combo
[5:29:40] <%laserbeaming> Oh, that. Is that nnot the Auto Combo?
[5:29:42] <%a_deadbeat> depending on what move takes your "smash" (the big cinematic hit in you combo) some moves have different properties. The only smash attack that dives you the chokeslam is his 2H
[5:29:51] <%a_deadbeat> gives*
[5:29:56] <TwistedVerse> woo
[5:30:03] <tmix1600> If it was done after a Down Heavy it brings down if you dont it doesn't
[5:30:22] <Sokumotanaka> When I nut "Destructive finish!"
[5:30:23] <tmix1600> Basically
[5:30:29] <TwistedVerse> nappa :L
[5:30:35] <%Nobrev> same pat, same
[5:30:38] <dimmensional> go to the lab and let us helpp your broly
[5:30:41] <ScreamingMeat> Memory go down
[5:30:44] <NicholasKane> Unfortunately, the solution is to watch videos.
[5:30:44] <%Mikatonic> basically teleport into wall bounce and auto combo again
[5:30:51] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> oh man, I got to get up early in the morning. Get fucked future me
[5:30:52] <%Hilleltaco> Same thing as other jumping heavies kinda. Others do a sliding knockdown if you've 2H'd them, while Broly's becomes a hit-grab
[5:30:53] <Rikui_> did you watch any broly tutorials?
[5:30:57] <Flyrant> it's the weird "smash attack" rule. Different moves take on different knock down properties in the air if you were launcher by a 2H prior
[5:30:57] <ScreamingMeat> Princess Trunks
[5:31:11] <exalt4747> But that's so dumb! But he's so cool!
[5:31:17] <majindusto> I want a Nappa with Hair alt
[5:31:31] <%a_deadbeat> @AngriestPat remember this is all in one day. It's completely natural you won't get everything
[5:31:31] <sdgundum990> Do a fight games stream with Woolie were you go in with the set goal of getting better at fight games.
[5:31:33] <%Mikatonic> broly's j2h is the stomp
[5:31:37] <TwistedVerse> but nappa is.. ooooh
[5:31:39] <Hammerknife> i haven't watched any of super. how did they get yamcha to stop playing baseball
[5:31:42] <TwistedVerse> LUL
[5:31:51] <exalt4747> They didn't.
[5:31:56] <Flyrant> I would LOVE to see Woolie and Pat play Guilty Gear
[5:32:10] <%bestwaifuritsu> apatBig apatWrong apatPat
[5:32:11] <tmix1600> Light dp Pat lol
[5:32:13] <+DrunkenDice> chat wrong? no Kappa
[5:32:14] <TwistedVerse> @Flyrant this is close enough :P
[5:32:18] <%Plague_Nurse> 3
[5:32:20] <+badchoice5> You have to build Broly's trust first, if he believes in you he'll do it
[5:32:27] <Sokumotanaka> does yamcha call nappa saiyan cause he never learned his name? That's awesome
[5:32:28] <Flyrant> nah DBfZ is nothing like guilty gear
[5:32:29] <Phalanx_Soul> sometimes its okay not to be the hero
[5:32:30] <%LocoCrazy_> @Flyrant I'm with you there
[5:32:34] <majindusto> Yamcha never stopped with baseball
[5:32:51] <exalt4747> Yamcha is like, the oldest pro athlete ever
[5:32:52] <TwistedVerse> losing to nappa welp
[5:33:01] <exalt4747> He's older than Goku and Chichi, who are grandparents now.
[5:33:16] <TheShockVox> I’m a might be a bad opponent for Pat, solely for the fact I also don’t like assists much and try to make it 1 on 1, when fighting him, with only switching being the most tag action I do. That being said, fun matches. I’m really surprised with how well he does a come back when I think I might have him beat.
[5:33:21] <Flyrant> yamcha drinks unicorn blood to stay young
[5:33:22] <tmix1600> Med dp CAN work but only sometimes and you have to really delay and time Super
[5:33:22] <Zteck123> Im still upset that they chose to put in Nappa over Raditz
[5:33:26] <ScreamingMeat> What do those Dragonballs do?
[5:33:31] <fmc009> @AngriestPat Hey thanks for the stream. I'm going to bed. You should do more of these. GGs
[5:33:35] <%NopeBadguy> yamcha is like
[5:33:36] <NicholasKane> @AngriestPat Consider intentionally dedicating some Streamed Labtime With Chat Coaching
[5:33:36] <exalt4747> Raditz had like, nothing to work with though
[5:33:37] <%NopeBadguy> 60 and single
[5:33:41] <%NopeBadguy> that's major FeelsBadMan
[5:33:58] <majindusto> Oh god...Yamcha IS older than Goku!!!
[5:33:59] <RezzyOK> LUL
[5:33:59] <Zteck123> So did Nappa, but they put him in anyway
[5:34:01] <Sielas> Jesus fuck all DBZ characters looking the same is so shit
[5:34:02] <TwistedVerse> all the single fighters, all the single fighters
[5:34:04] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> So what's stopping saiyans from doing the nearly kill myself hack again and again? If Dende isn't enough, senzu beans exist
[5:34:13] <majindusto> I totally forgot that
[5:34:15] <Sokumotanaka> Cell: Enjoy oblivion! *throws a copy of the game at you*
[5:34:20] <+badchoice5> it's pretty late
[5:34:29] <Flyrant> Max labs on stream all the time, it's honestly more interesting than watching you get bodied
[5:34:31] <duneblythe> 780
[5:34:35] <dimmensional> im one of the 40
[5:34:41] <TwistedVerse> lol
[5:34:44] <+badchoice5> I mean, I'll keep it on til I go to sleep
[5:34:47] <%NopeBadguy> maybe get woolie here to coach you next time you play figherz?
[5:34:52] <+Naniko> To be fair a lot of people would stay for your lovely personality, Patrick
[5:34:56] <dimmensional> is woolie better?
[5:34:57] <%Trinity5> pat it IS 2:30 in the morning lmao
[5:34:58] <exalt4747> COACH WOOLIE
[5:35:06] <duneblythe> I just like the sound of your voice
[5:35:13] <ebonifragaria> Peach needs to come and tell him to go to bed lol
[5:35:18] <tmix1600> Brolys air down Heavy is only good for corner combos
[5:35:20] <TwistedVerse> im here to stare into pat's sleepy eyes
[5:35:25] <dimmensional> does woolie stream dbfz?
[5:35:27] <TwistedVerse> before peach comes in to scold him
[5:35:28] <danknugglit> 230am on a Wednesday LUL
[5:35:32] <TheShockVox> @majindusto Always has been. remember Goku was dead for 7 years. So Yamaha is even OLDER
[5:35:38] <Hammerknife> its not like pat has to keep working hours
[5:35:41] <%megabrogus> It's 2 30 I gotta go to bed. Stupid life
[5:35:41] <danknugglit> Or thurs i guess LUL
[5:35:42] <gottigotbundles> woolie streamed yesterday
[5:35:46] <+Naniko> also at least 50% of us arent even watching, i've had the stream on for like 4 hours and have watched probably 45 minutes at most
[5:36:04] <Flyrant> lol yeah I'm just reading chat :P
[5:36:11] <TwistedVerse> pat asmr huh
[5:36:19] <ogcornflakes> good games Pat
[5:36:20] <Sokumotanaka> If you need help pat your discord may be the only choice and those broly combo vidoes
[5:36:22] <Hammerknife> i had this on while playing wargroove. that game is unstreamable and unplayable for more than a 2hr stretch
[5:36:23] <shockmaster3> pat no good
[5:36:26] <%TheStarbecue> Im here to try to help
[5:36:28] <%BlancoRico> I saw you get bodied
[5:36:28] <%Mikatonic> I'm watching
[5:36:29] <bigstupidjellyfish1337> holy shit pat get fucked
[5:36:32] <TheShockVox> Here’s hoping he puts on Third Strike some day
[5:36:32] <TwistedVerse> im watchin you pat, dont look away
[5:36:32] <%stolando_florida> I'm just kinda listening while I play Space Station 13
[5:36:32] <shockmaster3> pat sad
[5:36:33] <tmix1600> Im watching
[5:36:34] <NicholasKane> @AngriestPat As someone who's not big into the streaming game, I'd understated the importance of "making sure that I'm streaming something people want to watch." That being the concern, I know that my favorite episodes of Fisticuffs were the ones where Woolie would start the episode by trying to teach you and Matt how everything worked.
[5:36:34] <Hammerknife> but its nice to listen to pat be passive aggressive in the background
[5:36:35] <danknugglit> Im watching :)
[5:36:35] <%yay_waffles> ITS FINE
[5:36:37] <majindusto> Yamcha is likearound 49- 52 Years old!!!
[5:36:38] <Vroom0> I'm watching :)
[5:36:38] <%supersugoisenpai1> I'm playing Kingdom Hearts while listening
[5:36:39] <%tiishi> I'm here for the late night chilling
[5:36:42] <EJLeen> im watching :)
[5:36:42] <%megabrogus> Its true im not really watcing
[5:36:46] <MutedMimic> Its time to sleep FeelsBadMan 7
[5:36:48] <%calvarok> i always watch unless im listening to a vod
[5:36:48] <+badchoice5> I just hopped into Max's DBFZ stream, but the excessive competence repelled me
[5:36:49] <dimmensional> i wish you were on pc
[5:36:49] <%LixFury> i'll be real i was watching old videl clips from Z LUL
[5:36:50] <WhatzePh> Has Pat already played the DMC demo?
[5:36:52] <TwistedVerse> im watching your lush orange locks sway in the wind
[5:36:52] <shockmaster3> pat need elmo
[5:36:52] <Vigonept> Im loving listening to the bully pat stream
[5:36:53] <+DrunkenDice> viewing bot 325 reporting for duty :)
[5:36:53] <%bestwaifuritsu> At least you're not whining DSP style
[5:36:54] <$SirG005E> left tiddy right tiddy you know how it is
[5:36:54] <Chumblago13> imstill watching @AngriestPat
[5:36:54] <TheShockVox> you fool! You broke Pat’s heart!
[5:36:55] <+Naniko> PAT you know you're our favorite background noise cmon
[5:36:58] <sirrice77> @Hammerknife Do you find it have sudden difficulty spikes on some missions or am i just bad
[5:36:59] <%Trinity5> I'm watching whole labbing, oddly enough
[5:37:00] <%lazysaiyajin> girls are watching
[5:37:01] <%TheStarbecue> Yea, as much as i love this, Maybe DBFZ is a bad stream for Pat
[5:37:08] <A_Zealous_Retort> its fun to just hang out and listen to pat get bodied
[5:37:11] <+badchoice5> Damn straight
[5:37:12] <Mechanical_Mayhem> Don't be the big rude to pat! I'm watching, as long as you're enjoying yourself the content is good
[5:37:13] <cool_culainn> I'm watching while playing
[5:37:13] <duneblythe> headphones in, eyes closed
[5:37:14] <Twoiis> That's true about pretty much most games played.

[5:37:14] <TwistedVerse> LUL
[5:37:16] <Hammerknife> @sirrice77 there are occasional ones but so far you can't fail by just doing the advance war strat
[5:37:29] <Sokumotanaka> @AngriestPat You'll get it buddy
[5:37:29] <+MMetas> @AngriestPat It could be worse, you could be complaining how your rent isnt being paid and how it's our jobs to get on that
[5:37:30] <%TIME_PUNCHER> @AngriestPat Huh? Sorry, wasn't listening :P
[5:37:33] <Hammerknife> which is spamming mechs/spearmen and the occasional ranger/trebuchet/ballista
[5:37:45] <danknugglit> Max IS a fighting game robot
[5:37:49] <+JuriHansFeet> Still goin', eh?
[5:37:51] <TwistedVerse> videl Kreygasm Kreygasm

[5:38:04] <Flyrant> short hair videl > pigtails
[5:38:07] <Patitentiary> I'm here for pat voice and elmo appearances
[5:38:10] <StrikeTheGiant> play the dmc demo again, i still cant download that shit
[5:38:11] <Hammerknife> won't get you the S ranking, but its not like the missions tell you the turn maximum for S ranks...
[5:38:11] <bigstupidjellyfish1337> broly is too big
[5:38:12] <%yay_waffles> back when Videl was a good character
[5:38:12] <majindusto> SUPERIOR VIDEL
[5:38:13] <Rikui_> maybe people are leaving cause you keep losing to the same people Kappa
[5:38:13] <Sokumotanaka> @bestwaifuritsu Finally a man of culture
[5:38:20] <tmix1600> Use brolys mids and heavys more in neutral, they have armor
[5:38:25] <%TheStarbecue> You short hair degenerates leave this wholesome chat right now
[5:38:26] <sirrice77> eh i dont really care about S rank right now
[5:38:32] <%calvarok> there is so much talking in this even when ppl r just blocking shit
[5:38:34] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Adult Variant Videl is best Videl
[5:38:46] <Hammerknife> yeah just hold choke points with spearmen and chip with rangers/trebs/ballistae
[5:38:48] <TwistedVerse> @TheStarbecue you dirty evil kinkshamer you >:L LUL
[5:38:58] <%TheStarbecue> REEEEEe
[5:38:58] <DracaenaLeaf> I just took a nap whoa we're still streaming
[5:38:59] <+JuriHansFeet> Pigtails are the least wholesome thing in this mortal coil
[5:39:00] <%MightyMaxT> It's been a while since I've seen the second Broly movie. Didn't videl put up a somewhat fight against normal Broly?
[5:39:02] <Sokumotanaka> @TheStarbecue Make me *hiding on a castle wall* pfffffft
[5:39:07] <Bluewind098> so why did Pat drop 16?
[5:39:10] <danknugglit> Its anime you need to talk while you fight LUL
[5:39:19] <tmix1600> Hell no max
[5:39:37] <tmix1600> Videl get screwed immediately
[5:39:37] <+NovaTera> Teen Chichi > Videl
[5:39:42] <Sokumotanaka> TIME PRARDOX!!!
[5:39:43] <ogcornflakes> videl got instantly bodied
[5:39:44] <+JuriHansFeet> I still need to watch the new movie
[5:39:48] <TwistedVerse> monologueing mid fight makes me diamonds
[5:39:48] <+JuriHansFeet> Launch > Everyone
[5:39:52] <sirrice77> kinda boring but i mean i'd rather do that then get steamrolled accidentally
[5:39:55] <TheShockVox> @novatera That’s a fight I want to see.
[5:39:57] <+badchoice5> Videl is cheat, bringing in BF like that
[5:40:08] <%Trinity5> @angriestpat random rule of thumb: if they're health is over the sparking icon, 3 level 1s will kill the opponent
[5:40:08] <shockmaster3> why dont you switch characters out?
[5:40:08] <%LocoCrazy_> Remember Pat: it's trash CAN, not trash cannot. Love ya buddy.
[5:40:10] <%ThePuddingDead> bravo
[5:40:10] <tmix1600> Also second coming is bad
[5:40:12] <TwistedVerse> whUt
[5:40:13] <%Hilleltaco> YEYEYE
[5:40:17] <+NovaTera> we need a movie lol @theshockvox
[5:40:18] <danknugglit> LUL
[5:40:19] <%MightyMaxT> Sorry, it's been at least 10 years since I watched it and just remember she was there with Goten & Trunks
[5:40:20] <%ThePuddingDead> but gj with the block string
[5:40:22] <bigstupidjellyfish1337> CUTE
[5:40:26] <%Plague_Nurse> cheap
[5:40:27] <Sokumotanaka> Couple goals
[5:40:27] <%TheStarbecue> WAIT THATS GoHAN???
[5:40:29] <Bluewind098> Saiyaman's monologue is the best
[5:40:30] <%bestwaifuritsu> I honestly dont get why some people enjoy this game so much, seems like long periods of time doing nothing waiting for your opponent to finish their 500 hit combo
[5:40:34] <ebonifragaria> Ok so Hit's head just looks like a purple glans
[5:40:40] <Hammerknife> @sirrice77 its a problem with the type of game. when there's no big aoe damage and units can only kill at most 1 other unit no matter how strong they are, it means spam cheap filler
[5:40:40] <+JuriHansFeet> Different people like different games, shocking
[5:40:42] <%MightyMaxT> Also that Krillin got flung into a rock for the whole movie
[5:40:45] <ahalfeatenchocolateorange> just out his secret identity
[5:40:46] <%calvarok> that's hilarious
[5:40:54] <longrat> did pat manage to s-rank the DMC5 demo?
[5:40:55] <dance_c0mmander> just checking in on pat and Apex ad starts. big feels
[5:41:07] <TwistedVerse> oh look green pinnochio
[5:41:12] <Hammerknife> and for their cost spearmen are literally the best unit in the game in direct combat
[5:41:16] <+timbob> is he on pc or ps4?
[5:41:19] <%BlancoRico> its fine
[5:41:24] <%ssjklyco> ps4
[5:41:25] <%a_deadbeat> don't apologize for learning a game
[5:41:25] <%BlancoRico> ps4
[5:41:32] <TwistedVerse> @Hammerknife the ouya
[5:41:33] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> I didn't want to kick your ass to hard anyways
[5:41:36] <cool_culainn> Big sads
[5:41:38] <sirrice77> @Hammerknife yeah that makes sense, oh well
[5:41:39] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Kappa
[5:41:56] <danknugglit> You can do it pat \ :) /
[5:42:12] <%ThePuddingDead> @AngriestPat You ARE showing improvement, you got a lot of rust to shake off dude
[5:42:14] <Rikui_> last match now do a europe friendly dbfz stream
[5:42:17] <TwistedVerse> f
[5:42:27] <%Shindeil> DMC 5 doing the fighting game anime aesthetic is a bold move.
[5:42:34] <SilverRoddo> Bring it back, Pat.
[5:42:40] <%Shindeil> Looks like an ArcSys game
[5:42:41] <%Shindeil> Kappa
[5:42:45] <ebonifragaria> You can doooooo
[5:42:51] <AlasterAngelo> this is an NRS game

[5:43:08] <+Toast_Master_General> I totally forgot you were streaming tonight. Wish i could have been here the whole time
[5:43:17] <%bestwaifuritsu> You can at least kill Tien
[5:43:20] <ebonifragaria> Rusty old Pat, full of green rust
[5:43:20] <TwistedVerse> yamcha leaving craters everywhere
[5:43:24] <%TheStarbecue> ALMOST
[5:43:35] <dance_c0mmander> Your starting from the bottom so only up from here rite?
[5:43:37] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> use your S-Cells properly
[5:43:40] <+badchoice5> You were better when you streamed it a ways back, and you were better earlier tonight before you started focusing on improving

[5:44:10] <%Plague_Nurse> this game doesn't look fun
[5:44:12] <tmix1600> Light dp should work
[5:44:13] <cool_culainn> Cooler is cool
[5:44:16] <ebonifragaria> @Manjove I agree, you love Cooler Kappa
[5:44:16] <+mmSoTasty> does anyone disagree that Manjove loves Cooler?
[5:44:16] <TwistedVerse> comeback??
[5:44:21] <nepwar> pat must channel his inner GO1
[5:44:22] <Run44forrest> i never thhought of that, actually why would you demon elbow he couldve done a whole combo
[5:44:23] <%TheStarbecue> just pick a hot beer
[5:44:25] <%Aleate> Just pick a top tier 4Head
[5:44:25] <Sokumotanaka> PICOLOOOOOOOO
[5:44:25] <%TheStarbecue> yum
[5:44:27] <Rikui_> you should watch some broly/cooler tutorials pat
[5:44:29] <danknugglit> Oooh baby i like it raaaaaw
[5:44:29] <TwistedVerse> imagine dying to tien LUL
[5:44:31] <NicholasKane> @AngriestPat I know it's easy for me and others to say something like "Oh, just bring Woolie on so he can teach you!" and it's likely that that's quite a bit more difficult to schedule than it seems, but I'm certain that "Pat brings in Woolie to coach him to get good at DBFZ" would be a quite fun little event that have some nice cross-channel draw. Just something to think about, if the aims are "I want to get better", "I want competent information" and "I want people to not be bored as fuck by l
[5:44:37] <ogcornflakes> knee to the brain
[5:44:43] <+showmeyourmango> Just mash
[5:44:44] <TheShockVox> Woooooooo good game Pat, it’s been an honor
[5:44:46] <%ssjklyco> Just have fun
[5:44:49] <%AncelDeLambert> frustrating, but true of everyone
[5:44:50] <+YiggityYoni> oop
[5:44:57] <majindusto> STOP GETTIN GOOD
[5:45:01] <%AncelDeLambert> because improving involves ACTIVE thinking, aka choking
[5:45:04] <Bluewind098> It's probably because you're either being self conscious or overthinking things
[5:45:08] <+badchoice5> No, it's when you focus on "practice" you aren't playing to win, you are trying to learn. Which is fine, but it does happen.
[5:45:10] <TwistedVerse> emlo BibleThump
[5:45:14] <RantingRavager> Is it just because that every time you're trying to improve, you're focusing on one thing and not remembering to do other things that you do unconsciously?
[5:45:26] <%gusdabus91> hi pat
[5:45:28] <tmix1600> Pat you just need to learn at your own pace
[5:45:28] <Manjove> i wish i was good at fighting games, i wanna play Cooler
[5:45:29] <Sokumotanaka> I forgot bardock was a fighter
[5:45:32] <danknugglit> My dog does that sleep twitch BibleThump
[5:45:35] <%mercado94> punch them
[5:45:36] <Cowctus> Did I miss anything good?
[5:45:39] <Bluewind098> also what badchoice. You're probably figuring out what works compared to doing the thing you know works
[5:45:39] <%TheStarbecue> baby apatWink apatWink apatWink
[5:45:42] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> just play a decent Fighting Game like Melee
[5:45:46] <%Aleate> Big boi fight PogChamp
[5:45:49] <majindusto> BROCCOLI BATTLE
[5:45:50] <+mmSoTasty> well, trying to improve means changing what you're used to. which inevitably means getting worse at first

[5:45:53] <+LoudPackLarry15> sub only lobby?
[5:45:56] <ebonifragaria> What would be the most mismatched genre of game for DBZ characters?
[5:45:56] <nepwar> oh no
[5:45:57] <Hammerknife> the only fighting game i play are saltybet exhibs
[5:45:59] <%AncelDeLambert> it truly is ridiculous how BIG Broly is
[5:46:00] <Rikui_> ITS THE HEIGHT PAT
[5:46:01] <Sokumotanaka> Which broly do I shoot!?

[5:46:26] <Flyrant> survival horror
[5:46:26] <%a_deadbeat> Oh god I feel so bad. Pat, Broly's auto combo also gives him the chokeslam. I've been lying this whole time, it isn't just 2H
[5:46:26] <ebonifragaria> DBZ dating sim when
[5:46:27] <%TheStarbecue> If Pat ever streams Melee i will actually eat a grenade idec
[5:46:32] <sdgundum990> I just want to see Woolie and Pat play the fight games. People who play together at relatively close power levels who fight together improve together.
[5:46:35] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> DBZ Point and Click adventure
[5:46:36] <Bluewind098> Like Professor Layton kind of puzzle game
[5:46:37] <Hammerknife> if pat played puyo puyo or some other competitive puzzle game i'd sub immediately

[5:46:39] <+dougrayman> infinite!!!!
[5:46:41] <%Plague_Nurse> No Fun Match
[5:46:41] <tmix1600> WHY
[5:46:42] <Rikui_> also m just thew auto combo
[5:46:43] <EJLeen> never stop going in
[5:46:43] <Manjove> Xenoverse 2 is basically a dating sim already
[5:46:47] <%Shindeil> Talking strictlt gameplay; KHII - III is like Smash Melee - Ultimate.
[5:46:52] <TwistedVerse> swoly
[5:46:54] <Zteck123> I mean, there is a DBZ dating sim
[5:46:54] <%mercado94> magic
[5:46:55] <cool_culainn> God broly is like the least fun character to fight in this game
[5:46:57] <tmix1600> FUCK THIS GUY
[5:46:57] <TheShockVox> Thats literally it. Just gotta have fun with it. I’ll admit, it would’ve helped ME if I didn’t hear you on the stream while fighting you saying “well this will be a short match” that literally psyched me out. I finally get what you guys meant by what Woolie did in fisticuffs. That shit really works, and you weren’t even TRYING to psyche me out
[5:47:04] <$hatesdps> X FACTOR
[5:47:04] <%LocoCrazy_> These strings
[5:47:05] <nepwar> bigpow bringing in the big ouch
[5:47:05] <Zteck123> Just not what you want it to be
[5:47:06] <+ironkingk> pat its easy just do better
[5:47:08] <%Hilleltaco> @AngriestPat He only does the grab if they've been launched by an upwards "smash" attack, with the camera shift. 2H and auto combo count as the right kind of launcher
[5:47:10] <TwistedVerse> EZ
[5:47:15] <+dougrayman> wow...
[5:47:16] <danknugglit> Brolly is so fucking cool
[5:47:18] <Twoiis> read like a book.
[5:47:19] <Rikui_> thats the auto combo
[5:47:19] <Flyrant> what don't you get?
[5:47:21] <ahalfeatenchocolateorange> can barely go 3 for 3? apparently yes.
[5:47:22] <+dougrayman> thats a good brolly
[5:47:22] <+zinris> JUST MASH LIGHT PAT
[5:47:24] <Mechanical_Mayhem> Never ending Broly combos, rip
[5:47:24] <tmix1600> Auto combo mashing
[5:47:24] <ogcornflakes> hit the guy until he stops moving
[5:47:26] <ahalfeatenchocolateorange> broly
[5:47:28] <Manjove> Broly power MAXIMUM
[5:47:32] <$hatesdps> i mean you could always just give in and play apex legends
[5:47:34] <nepwar> must be his color choice
[5:47:36] <+zinris> thats the auto combo
[5:47:41] <nepwar> green=more power
[5:47:43] <TwistedVerse> knees broken: check
[5:47:43] <%mercado94> it has to be magic
[5:47:44] <Rikui_> but it is
[5:47:45] <+DrunkenDice> it is
[5:47:47] <bananachode> elmo power is maximum
[5:47:49] <%Hilleltaco> If you haven't "smashed" them upwards, jumping heavy just does a hit
[5:47:51] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Play Melee instead, something GOOD
[5:47:53] <%TempestaDePrimo> broly is the dumbest goddamn character
[5:47:56] <Bluewind098> Has Pat tried out Apex?
[5:47:58] <+DrunkenDice> no he linked them with cmd grabs
[5:48:02] <Rikui_> it didn't loop though
[5:48:03] <Manjove> but he is so cool!
[5:48:03] <+zinris> at end after the mash you do the grab
[5:48:04] <Zteck123> How fuking dare you
[5:48:08] <tmix1600> Thats why he walked forward
[5:48:11] <redgrave0> wait Pat's doing matchs
[5:48:11] <Flyrant> it didn't lop though
[5:48:12] <%Plague_Nurse> Play a more fun and balanced fighting game
[5:48:14] <SilverRoddo> The Apex Predator?
[5:48:14] <%a_deadbeat> it will, I promis it will
[5:48:15] <BIGPOW777> The Auto combo does the coke slam
[5:48:19] <Flyrant> loop*
[5:48:21] <+LoudPackLarry15> You can do it up to 2 times
[5:48:25] <sdgundum990> Ghost of combos dropped is a great name.
[5:48:44] <Manjove> 21 is only 9 years old!!!
[5:48:44] <sdgundum990> No combo.
[5:48:53] <TwistedVerse> nice
[5:48:54] <nepwar> chocolate 21 Kreygasm
[5:48:55] <+DrunkenDice> Pat did it!
[5:48:56] <+zinris> LOL
[5:48:56] <Sinister_Aglet> @Bluewind098 he said he tried it off stream, doesn't seem to care for it
[5:49:02] <+StrokeGodMillionair> that then vanish after
[5:49:05] <Flyrant> then do vanish
[5:49:06] <%mercado94> that color of #21 Kreygasm
[5:49:10] <+zinris> do a vanish after
[5:49:11] <tmix1600> Then vanish and repeat
[5:49:26] <Bluewind098> ah ok. Shame I enjoyed my 4 games I just did tonight
[5:49:28] <Flyrant> too late
[5:49:30] <TwistedVerse> chocolate goddess
[5:49:32] <arfdude> GO INTO TRAINING MODE
[5:49:33] <+Naniko> P A T H E T I C W O R M
[5:49:36] <%Hilleltaco> Idea was right, timing was off
[5:49:38] <+LoudPackLarry15> delay the air throw pat
[5:49:42] <+badchoice5> Nice
[5:49:48] <Flyrant> vanish was too late
[5:49:51] <%Hilleltaco> It was just a little too slow
[5:49:52] <SilverRoddo> I feel the Ghost of Combos Dropped looks out the window on occasion.
[5:49:52] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Ghost of Combo's Dropped
[5:49:55] <johnnyiguess> pat, play a balanced game like Def Jam NY
[5:49:56] <+DrunkenDice> time the vanish better
[5:49:59] <+ironkingk> JUST DO BETTER
[5:50:02] <+badchoice5> Broly Power < Maximum
[5:50:04] <+zinris> well you're halfway there pat
[5:50:04] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@Manjove) (warning)
[5:50:07] <Rikui_> @AngriestPat btw if your assist doesn't come out that is because you were blocking before calling it the game doesn't allow that
[5:50:13] <StrikeTheGiant> did kingdom hearts 3 disappoint anyone as much as it did me cause i was pretty miffed by that game
[5:50:21] <%Plague_Nurse> 3
[5:50:27] <%a_deadbeat> don't tell him to delay the air throw, you haven't had to delay the air throw since like 3 patches ago
[5:50:29] <%Shindeil> Yes
[5:50:29] <%mercado94> i love the game
[5:50:30] <tmix1600> Wait to meet height
[5:50:30] <Manjove> do a better cooler tho
[5:50:31] <Flyrant> KH III LUL
[5:50:35] <Zteck123> Don't spoil the game I dont plan on playing
[5:50:36] <sdgundum990> KH3 was shit out in a year I guarentee it.
[5:50:38] <johnnyiguess> do combo
[5:50:38] <Bluewind098> There are some people who weren't happy but I loved it
[5:50:42] <TwistedVerse> F
[5:50:47] <%a_deadbeat> Also, that does link, the timing is just weird and specific
[5:50:54] <%TheStarbecue> @AngriestPat My b, i only played Cooler for a bit, maybe i forgot
[5:50:59] <+ironkingk> F
[5:51:00] <Bluewind098> Might be my favorite KH and I hope it gets DLC/Final Mix to round it better
[5:51:03] <ahalfeatenchocolateorange> kh 3 is okay. not as good as 2 but it's not a bad game. just not worth the time hype.
[5:51:06] <tmix1600> I well send you me doing it on twitter if you want
[5:51:10] <TwistedVerse> woah
[5:51:21] <NicholasKane> KH3 was not worth waiting 17 years for.
[5:51:23] <TwistedVerse> comeback :LLLL
[5:51:28] <Flyrant> KH 3 is just boring. Way too easy, story is whatever as always
[5:51:32] <mikesapartment> whyd oes he keep touching his nose?

[5:51:44] <+badchoice5> Good win Pat
[5:51:46] <TwistedVerse> WOO
[5:51:48] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> I can't wait for FF7 to not be worth the wait
[5:51:49] <%TheStarbecue> ayyyyyyyy
[5:51:50] <nepwar> gg
[5:51:50] <%ThePuddingDead> nj
[5:51:50] <sdgundum990> I waited 37 years for this! residentSleeper
[5:51:50] <+DrunkenDice> psykenGG
[5:51:52] <%LocoCrazy_> Good way to close the night off buddy
[5:51:55] <%TheStarbecue> We DO IT
[5:51:56] <+badchoice5> Go to bed on that win
[5:51:56] <bananachode> pat power is maximum
[5:52:01] <%mercado94> damn
[5:52:02] <Flyrant> FF 7 remake will be awful
[5:52:04] <+Naniko> @Bluewind098 No Final mix sadly but will be DLC
[5:52:06] <%Plague_Nurse> Memes aside, KH3 left me blue balled hard. The entire game felt pointless and rushed
[5:52:07] <ebonifragaria> Maybe you've gotten better at video games in the meantime? @Flyrant
[5:52:07] <cool_culainn> @silverroddo only when it rains
[5:52:09] <TwistedVerse> @Flyrant :c
[5:52:10] <Hammerknife> well that's generally the problem with resurrecting ancient franchises to get nostalgia purchases
[5:52:14] <tmix1600> You have to let the dp ride for a bit
[5:52:20] <ahalfeatenchocolateorange> ff7 remake is destined to fail at this point.
[5:52:22] <Flyrant> @ebonifragaria that's probably true
[5:52:23] <NicholasKane> @AngriestPat Don't get discouraged. The discord will give you the help you ask for.
[5:52:24] <Bluewind098> Honestly a large part of the reason why I like KH3 is because I really liked dicking around in the Disney worlds
[5:52:24] <danknugglit> Saltiest pat
[5:52:26] <Manjove> can mosquitoes actually bite Cell?
[5:52:27] <SilverRoddo> spyPraise spyTea
[5:52:28] <TyroneRugen> you should rest on that win. Positive thoughts.
[5:52:33] <%bestwaifuritsu> Have you tried doing combo though
[5:52:34] <%Trinity5> probably getting frustrated with chat too lmfao
[5:52:36] <sdgundum990> Don't get mad, get competitive.
[5:52:39] <%TheStarbecue> there's a lot of rules
[5:52:43] <Bluewind098> I didn't really mind the story taking until the end to get going
[5:52:43] <majindusto> No FINAL FANTASY characters being in Kingdom Hearts 3 pisses me off!
[5:52:44] <Hammerknife> nobody who is asking for a ff7 remake has played the game recently. it's pretty good but very clunky
[5:52:46] <artoflec> yeah KH3 was great so far, story stuff is whatever as always
[5:52:50] <TyroneRugen> only the worlds strongest mosquitos
[5:52:51] <%FeralFozzie> rules are for suckers
[5:52:56] <AlasterAngelo> don't get mad, get sad. sad that you can't win. that's the key to winning
[5:53:03] <TwistedVerse> :L
[5:53:10] <ebonifragaria> @AlasterAngelo not for the Hulk
[5:53:16] <TwistedVerse> korean pro tip git guuuuud
[5:53:17] <Hammerknife> but it has never been a game that deserved the 20+ years of fellating by people who were like 3 when it came out
[5:53:17] <TheShockVox> @plague_nurse 13 years will do that to ya
[5:53:19] <Flyrant> I recently replayed FF7, was just as good as I remember it.
[5:53:22] <%mercado94> after this stream I'll be continuing playing KH3 LUL
[5:53:24] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> is the image frozen for anyone else? is it not supposed to be an animated loop anymore?
[5:53:28] <%Plague_Nurse> 5 years
[5:53:28] <SilverRoddo> Pat's gonna yell a hole in the clouds.
[5:53:36] <ebonifragaria> It is frozen!
[5:53:39] <%mercado94> its also frozen
[5:53:39] <TwistedVerse> so are kh fanboys the new sonic fanboys
[5:53:41] <%mercado94> to me
[5:53:45] <%TheStarbecue> did yall know that if you belch and fart at the same time it causes liver failure and you die instantly?
[5:53:48] <Flyrant> frozen!
[5:53:49] <ahalfeatenchocolateorange> "I was frozen today"
[5:53:53] <ebonifragaria> Frozen mustard
[5:53:56] <%Plague_Nurse> @TwistedVerse yes
[5:54:01] <Hammerknife> @Flyrant as a evolutionary step in games its superb. as a rpg it's kind of dull and doesn't know what kind of story it wants to tell
[5:54:01] <%chrishnaw> !uptime
[5:54:02] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 5h 54m.
[5:54:02] <Bluewind098> Like whatever about Xehanort is putting his dark dick into I just want to make dandelions float for Rapunzul
[5:54:05] <danknugglit> The lupis broke it
[5:54:05] <TheShockVox> Did he says he’s done for the day?
[5:54:08] <TwistedVerse> @Plague_Nurse welp
[5:54:11] <ebonifragaria> @TheStarbecue is that a glitch or intended?
[5:54:15] <NicholasKane> @TheStarbecue how dare you get my hopes up
[5:54:20] <%mercado94> @TwistedVerse Its just a combination of shitposters, people that didnt played previous games, hate the popular thing mentality, stupid people that really thought this will be the last game and people that overhyped the game.
[5:54:22] <+badchoice5> KH3 was by far the highest production quality KH game, it's gorgeous, I just wish it had more endgame/secret bosses
[5:54:23] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> @TheShockVox Yep hes gonna do donations in a sec
[5:54:27] <%ThePuddingDead> i mean he IS a good teacher when it comes to being introduced to this
[5:54:29] <%ThePuddingDead> he needs time
[5:54:34] <TheShockVox> Ok thanks
[5:54:35] <%TheStarbecue> @ebonifragaria intended. god is a dick
[5:54:36] <Hammerknife> the rpg system is too easily broken by busted materia combinations and the world is not all that interesting outside the 'fuck the man' vibe of shinra megacorp
[5:54:40] <majindusto> No, Cause Kingdom Hearts games are good...Unlike Modern Sonic games
[5:54:41] <%FrustratedAF> uh.... should the stream be stuck on the paige frame?
[5:54:41] <TwistedVerse> @mercado94 probably :L
[5:54:52] <Bluewind098> With that said Endgame was fun even though there were some things that were rushed in areas
[5:54:59] <AlasterAngelo> hey that character looks like paige
[5:55:02] <artoflec> yeah kind of ridiculous to compare...ANYTHING to modern sonic
[5:55:03] <Manjove> i miss Cooler
[5:55:03] <Bluewind098> But whatever because Secret Ending was the hypest shit
[5:55:05] <ahalfeatenchocolateorange> stream, much like paige, is broken
[5:55:06] <%chrishnaw> apatHoldon ???
[5:55:17] <Rikui_> you really should watch rooflemongers tutorials they helped me a great deal
[5:55:17] <+badchoice5> Pat, we all want our power to be at MAXIMUM in everything we do, but it's ok to be momentarily less than MAXIMUM sometimes, especially when you are trying to learn.
[5:55:19] <%FrustratedAF> apatBig apatHoldon
[5:55:21] <Manjove> want to watch movie again
[5:55:22] <dance_c0mmander> If meltyblood is played in bathrooms where does saltyblood pat play his fighting games?
[5:55:22] <ebonifragaria> Pat accidentally peed on his computer
[5:55:22] <Mechanical_Mayhem> Eat a copy of the game to learn all it's mechanics
[5:55:25] <%mercado94> I love Kingdom Hearts but I'll never consider them a 10/10 game. Its the best and more fun 8/10 game
[5:55:25] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Sonic is the best franchise ever
[5:55:30] <%chrishnaw> apatSkelmo apatSkelmo apatSkelmo apatSkelmo apatSkelmo
[5:55:34] <%Trinity5> sup
[5:55:38] <ebonifragaria> ..please don't read that.
[5:55:39] <%mercado94> im not here
[5:55:39] <Manjove> i want Cooler back
[5:55:39] <ebonifragaria> damn it
[5:55:42] <artoflec> hi pat :)
[5:55:44] <%Trinity5> lmfao
[5:55:46] <Zteck123> The thing I want from KH3 is to play as Roxas. If thats not the case, fuk it
[5:55:46] <Flyrant> :c
[5:55:46] <danknugglit> 3am guess i should sleep maybe <3 thanks pat :) big good night
[5:55:47] <TwistedVerse> LUL
[5:55:50] <NicholasKane> Why is dmc5 listed under Demos, but there's no demo on its page?
[5:55:50] <%mercado94> lies!
[5:55:51] <Mechanical_Mayhem> consume
[5:55:52] <%Trinity5> were gonna be here for an hour
[5:55:52] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> No Kappa
[5:55:53] <%ssjklyco> Big sandbags
[5:55:54] <%Plague_Nurse> ban him
[5:55:56] <majindusto> Peed the Compy
[5:55:59] <%mercado94> ban him
[5:56:03] <TheShockVox> Haha, I’m just so damn happy I actually got some matches in. I’m likely never gonna meet the dude at a con, so this was the closest I can get. Big thanks to any and everyone who helped me find the server he was on. Here’s hoping someday he does Third Strike. Now that’s where I want to take him on
[5:56:03] <+ironkingk> belmo
[5:56:03] <Hammerknife> there's also the fact that if you disconnected the arcs of the game you could easily imagine disc 1 ff7 being a completely different game from disc 3
[5:56:03] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Don't ban me plz
[5:56:05] <Manjove> bought REsi2 just now
[5:56:05] <TwistedVerse> emlo has arisen
[5:56:07] <cool_culainn> @angriestpat thanks for the games fun to be bodied by you
[5:56:22] <gottigotbundles> I'll make a video for you pat
[5:56:27] <nina9669> like 700 people left
[5:56:28] <bananachode> elmos power is maximum
[5:56:29] <%Plague_Nurse> Wait what
[5:56:31] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Maybe he was just a G
[5:56:35] <Neo_Kaiser> I'm still here.
[5:56:38] <%Plague_Nurse> I thought the case was full of G
[5:56:43] <SilverRoddo> A gram?
[5:56:44] <StrikeTheGiant> kh3s levels were boring and empty, graphically it looked good, but it has way less cool moves than 2 did, way way to little variety in keyblades, 8 worlds. the best part was the end of the game.
[5:56:47] <%ssjklyco> Resident Evil GT
[5:56:57] <%TheStarbecue> "thanks molested"
[5:56:57] <majindusto> Case had T and G
[5:57:07] <%Plague_Nurse> ooooh
[5:57:12] <Bluewind098> Nah I disagree with everything there
[5:57:13] <Flyrant> RE 2 Remake is better than the original, don't @ me
[5:57:17] <TwistedVerse> @StrikeTheGiant :L
[5:57:22] <Bluewind098> Espeically on the Keyblades. They were kickass
[5:57:25] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> @Flyrant @@@@@@@
[5:57:28] <ogcornflakes> game peaked at toy box tbh
[5:57:34] <Flyrant> :O
[5:57:34] <%Plague_Nurse> THe keyblades were ass
[5:57:38] <StrikeTheGiant> lol they looked like ass
[5:57:44] <%mercado94> LUL
[5:57:45] <TwistedVerse> x blade AHa
[5:57:55] <artoflec> @StrikeTheGiant i feel the complete opposite, i spent hours just exploring and looking for things and the keyblade transformations were all so much fun to work with, and the last world is the most linear, least interesting and least involved.
[5:57:58] <+Neryl_> C++ that's not even a B-. Kappa
[5:58:00] <+darksteel78> Good ole C++
[5:58:10] <Bluewind098> Nah. They're the best they've ever been in terms of functionality
[5:58:17] <nightwing1936> Dude No Joke an RE Battle Royale could actually Be Pretty Amazing
[5:58:18] <StrikeTheGiant> looking for what? there was nothing there
[5:58:20] <Futurecity10> kill your teacher and eat her.
[5:58:28] <dance_c0mmander> Play a game of LANCER if you love robots
[5:58:36] <Flyrant> they need to remake RE outbreak
[5:58:36] <TwistedVerse> @Neryl_ and not an a+, automatic fail
[5:58:41] <Hammerknife> i would also immediately sub if pat and woolie got into board game streaming
[5:58:43] <%TheStarbecue> This Stream was the only thing keeping me tethered to this world and I for one am glad i can finally abandon this shit existence. Earth is ya'lls problem now, fuckers apatWink apatWink apatWink
[5:58:44] <artoflec> @StrikeTheGiant treasures, photo missions, mickey symbols, whatever other fights
[5:58:58] <Hammerknife> there's nothing more pure than board game salt from catan or dominion
[5:58:58] <+badchoice5> Lunastra and Teostra are cancer
[5:58:59] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> RE Mercenaries is one step away from Battle Royale already
[5:58:59] <Flyrant> teostra is easy peasy
[5:59:06] <%mercado94> oh boy
[5:59:07] <StrikeTheGiant> well all that shit is extremely fucking boring
[5:59:16] <+badchoice5> Lunastra is to Teostra as Teostra is to everything else
[5:59:26] <artoflec> @StrikeTheGiant it was not and that's why i did it elaSmile
[5:59:28] <exalt4747> I have no idea what that even means
[5:59:32] <nina9669> ye
[5:59:43] <Bluewind098> Well it's either what KH3 has or the literal box and hallways previous games had
[5:59:44] <majindusto> REMAKE 2 is by no means a perfect remake like RE1 REMAKE...Too much cut enimies/scenes without adding any new enemies like RE did Crimson heads/Lisa Trevor
[5:59:45] <StrikeTheGiant> lol fair enough diggity
[5:59:46] <$MajorCrasher> COWARD
[5:59:48] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Long Hair Videl is for Pedos
[5:59:51] <TheShockVox> That’s depressing
[5:59:51] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 6 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 24oz (720mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
