[0:06:34] <lambishly> Bioware has been gutted beyond recognition, so many people left during the development of Anthem it's like entirely new staff
[0:06:46] <+Plankman> it just now started bugging me that this intro is persona 5 aesthetic themed, but pat is wearing the persona 4 uniform in his drawing
[0:06:52] <+Dayube> am I just bad or is grandmaster a bit rough?
[0:06:56] <+Diamond_Dynamo> I'm excited to see Pat play this, because I'm really enjoying it, and it's definitely not what I expected, in a way that I don't wanna spoil
[0:06:59] <+el_thag> So it’s took EA six years to make a good trouble free game? HA!
[0:06:59] <Riorii> The game isn’t even trying to hide it, it’s STAR SOULS and I love it

[0:11:14] <+DesertPenguin> Apex Legends?
[0:11:14] <Mendin> There's a seasonal Plum Twist Redbull out now and it's actually quite delightful.
[0:11:15] <+soulsbjorne> is he playing on grandmaster?
[0:11:16] <%supersugoisenpai1> I didn't know it existed
[0:11:17] <aracon_> oh god yeah
[0:11:17] <%Bt_Robot> Fuck EA.
[0:11:19] <+Alopekis> @dekkitout I haven't seen anyone helicopter themselves with it, but they do have the sword.
[0:11:19] <%PigGuy800> also I loved Republic commando
[0:11:19] <+Punchasaur> Vader’s edgy apprentice who looked like every game protagonist from 2006 to 2014 lol
[0:11:21] <%Taglog7> Jedi Nioh Soul Sekiro
[0:11:23] <Solidnick18> well EA did it with titanfall 2
[0:11:23] <+DesertPenguin> Apex Legends had ZERO advertisement
[0:11:25] <%Kiiper> Did you know Need For Speed had a new game?
[0:11:26] <+D00msDayDan> what's up with respawn games and bad advertising
[0:11:27] <devanmuse> @AngriestPat is peach okay after nearly getting concussed?
[0:11:29] <%Razputin217> EA BAD
[0:11:30] <deadbeat34> I forgot it was coming out.
[0:11:30] <%THATGUY_789> UnSharted
[0:11:30] <Vashido22> @AngriestPat It felt like EA wanted it to bomb
[0:11:30] <+Diamond_Dynamo> Has Respawn ever had a well advertised game?
[0:11:31] <%vaporousTippler> It has a lot of Uncharted, but the rest of the game makes up for that.
[0:11:31] <+el_thag> Inquisitor fidget spinners are intact whoever asked!
[0:11:31] <mield916> EA is trying to kill this game by ignorance
[0:11:32] <%3rdwarrior> thought you didnt follow stars wars?
[0:11:32] <thegreenbenis> This game looks like a stinker. @AngriestPat
[0:11:34] <nawadap136> i mean its Respawn, EA hats them
[0:11:35] <%happyface699> Oh yeah
[0:11:36] <Dakuu75> finally, a triple-A game with a ginger-protagonist~ <3
[0:11:37] <TotallyJustBacon> its not really
[0:11:37] <+Siconia> I'm sorry?
[0:11:38] <Solidnick18> it's kinda like that
[0:11:39] <damascussteele> shittime LESGO
[0:11:39] <BlindGato> Oh man it's like Respawn has a track record of getting SHAFTED
[0:11:40] <tacoisgoods> When did Titanfall 2 come out?
[0:11:41] <GTgamerZ> you going for a DEX build or a Riotous STRENGTH build
[0:11:42] <%g_rimbo> EA dont want it to sell thats why
[0:11:42] <Vashido22> GIMME THAT
[0:11:42] <%Ranryu692> All of these things are accurate
[0:11:42] <%keyworthe> it's uncharted dark souls with puzzle jumping platformer
[0:11:43] <%stemlo_> Isn't more Sekiro than Souls?
[0:11:45] <+DesertPenguin> Yea Apex Legends was also Respawn
[0:11:45] <%keyworthe> ugh
[0:11:46] <+Alopekis> It's like Sekiro mated with Uncharted
[0:11:47] <dekkitout> Show. Don't tell.
[0:11:47] <+griffball13> because EA
[0:11:47] <+DesertPenguin> and EA
[0:11:48] <d00hicky2> EA just dropped a NFS game out of nowhere.
[0:11:48] <Aydarkzero> hey Pat
[0:11:49] <Lenmutt> Game looked like the safest piece of dry toast.
[0:11:50] <+DesertPenguin> EA sucks
[0:11:51] <Deadbulky> Its kida like uncharted
[0:11:51] <%GarbageQueenEllie> This is why marketing is important, people
[0:11:53] <%ChaosAethr> Because EA
[0:11:55] <%xtremegamer80> @AngriestPat How much do you know about Star Wars Rebels?
[0:11:59] <+soulsbjorne> play on grandmaster you big coward
[0:11:59] <TotallyJustBacon> because spoilers, its very heavy on story
[0:12:02] <%BallinArbiter> EA bad
[0:12:02] <TheDr0t> it's a dark Souls of star wars
[0:12:04] <%Savarro> Yeah I only knew about the Metroidvania aspects because of reddit links
[0:12:06] <%Bt_Robot> How does EA still have the Star Wars license?
[0:12:09] <%ShichiNoBushi> Not playing Pokémon today?
[0:12:09] <Solidnick18> yay for respawn fuck EA
[0:12:09] <+el_thag> It’s Space Charted Souls
[0:12:11] <+griffball13> EA doesn't want to be wrong
[0:12:12] <%THATGUY_789> Electronic Sharts
[0:12:14] <Aydarkzero> well fuck that guy cause this game is solid
[0:12:14] <%cvp5127> ITS STAR WARS THO
[0:12:16] <+Plankman> it's the dark souls of marketing campaigns
[0:12:16] <+Alopekis> Respawn did a great job
[0:12:16] <zipfile777> NotLikeThis
[0:12:17] <dekkitout> @xtremegamer80 You really expect Pat to know about Rebels?
[0:12:17] <Reanimator83> Thought it was shit until the second trailer
[0:12:23] <%PigGuy800> Exactly!!!!
[0:12:24] <%JJCheeker> Those bastards
[0:12:25] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Sounds like a suit.
[0:12:25] <%Taglog7> Gotta kinder egg the shit out of em
[0:12:25] <%Stratiotai2> white monster lol
[0:12:27] <%Savarro> They also put it up against Pokemon too
[0:12:27] <Aydarkzero> it's a bit jank but still pretty good
[0:12:27] <thegreenbenis> MONSTER
[0:12:31] <%a_lucky_soul> no doubt
[0:12:31] <+Siconia> Man I did my final business report on how EA was fucking up it's entire business model. Full fucking marks.
[0:12:32] <heavenlygunner> EA is peek boomer
[0:12:32] <MoulesFritz> white monster is the best tasting energy drink fight me
[0:12:33] <%xtremegamer80> @dekkitout He probably knows someone
[0:12:34] <+ZoltanBMagnus> @AngriestPat Hey, man. child gambling sells

[0:12:36] <+Punchasaur> White man protag 4Head
[0:12:41] <%nevan0> LMAO
[0:12:42] <+Alopekis> Maybe Respawn will overthrow their EA overlords
[0:12:43] <%cerazor01> Star Wars Rebels is boring
[0:12:43] <Solidnick18> not really
[0:12:43] <%BallinArbiter> EA is boomer

[0:12:47] <%ShichiNoBushi> It has robot spider Darth Maul.
[0:12:49] <%Bt_Robot> How much monetization do you think this game will have?
[0:12:49] <+Siconia> Togrutan

[0:12:50] <+Diamond_Dynamo> I mean, I was gonna get it regardless because Respawn, but I'm really glad it's actually good
[0:12:51] <CelioHogane> THE HOT PILOT GIRL
[0:12:53] <nawadap136> "Those Apex guys could NEVER make a good singleplayer game." - EA, probably.

[0:12:58] <dekkitout> I stand corrected
[0:12:58] <+Alopekis> The double twi'lek
[0:12:58] <%BallinArbiter> Clone wars is good
[0:13:04] <+Plankman> what?!
[0:13:07] <%Cloudkiller91> EA actively tries to sabotage their companies for profit though.
[0:13:07] <Vashido22> no?
[0:13:07] <dekkitout> That was Clone Wars
[0:13:08] <%stemlo_> nah that was still TCW

[0:17:59] <$Chatterbox1991> MrDestructoid500 Yeah Sure, Star Wars is incapable of depth in the Modern Era; because KOTOR1 and 2 Hand of Thrawn and the Clone Wars series are all just schlocky action garbage, right Pat? I love but seriously you and Woolie need to sleep more often before you do stuff because when ether of you are underslept and cantankerous its legit hard to listen to.
[0:18:00] <TwoThirdsBucky> what
[0:18:00] <AnacondaVirtue> Pat that's not how that worked

[0:18:28] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Force Unleashed 1 was lit AF too
[0:18:29] <%vaporousTippler> SWTOR isn't bad if you play solo and ignore the first 50 hours or so.

[0:19:01] <%thegreatestbambe> moon2COOM

[0:19:10] <%rumtumtugnutz> also the new game is pretty good. no means perfect, but it is by no means bad

[0:20:06] <laguerrilha> Pat could be dumping right now and we would never know
[0:20:06] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> I hope ReSpawn keep getting good jobs
[0:20:06] <Deofiro> Paige is fist fighting the wall
[0:20:06] <%AncelDeLambert> ah, the Titanfall guys
[0:20:07] <TotallyJustBacon> the story in this is really good
[0:20:07] <%mh9s> and like most women when she says no she means yes
[0:20:07] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @King_Wolf_Rigger I did enjoy what little of the Smuggler campaign I played.
[0:20:08] <%Alopekis> Respawn is officially my only hope with EA
[0:20:09] <Psyramics> against all odds, Respawn makes good video games
[0:20:10] <Louie_Salmon> Good video games that EA refuses to advertise
[0:20:12] <Dakuu75> *breathes in deep... the exhales...* "Yup, this is why I watch this stream." <3
[0:20:15] <TheDr0t> respawn is like the last hope of ea
[0:20:17] <%joylent_blue> the little bit i saw of this game seemed pretty bland, but maybe that was the players fault
[0:20:20] <%AncelDeLambert> well, if this has movement like Titanfall, it might actually be good
[0:20:22] <Dwarven_Gaming> lets see how long EA can choke em before they die and get swept under the rug
[0:20:23] <+D00msDayDan> i'm not even that hype for fallen order i'm just buying it for respawn
[0:20:25] <Aydarkzero> i don't know how to feel about Death Stranding
[0:20:26] <%StrifeZubia> In celebration of watching Pat play the game I've been banging my head against, I've now ordered VVcDonald's
[0:20:27] <%ShiftyFish> ShiftyFish subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months! Star Wars is dumb, but its usually entertaining despite quality. I've been waiting to see you play this because I wasn't sure on it. I hope you enjoy it.
[0:20:30] <+Story_Ark> ive already given in to fanservice and wanting dumb shit. hell yeah ill get hyped for an at st

[0:20:43] <%DracaenaLeaf> You can understand the game just by the trailers
[0:20:43] <%rumtumtugnutz> the monster has defeated pat. the delicious zero ultra white goodness has ruined his taste for the red bull.
[0:20:54] <%dmtjinni> apatCanada stupid Canadian pat
[0:20:55] <Tedious_Tickles> don't expect the movement from Titanfall, completely different game genre
[0:20:57] <Riorii> You finished it?

[0:21:00] <+AnthraxJohnson> Pat how big is your wheen
[0:21:06] <Mendin> Wait, what? Kojima's infinite budget and time let him make a game that actually wraps up and explains all its plot by the end?!
[0:21:07] <%joylent_blue> no he didn't
[0:21:07] <aracon_> still in chapter 3 and atm things aren't as wacky as I was expecting
[0:21:08] <%blastazoid26> Better than astral chains ending
[0:21:09] <Hellarussian> its about family

[0:21:20] <baronvonbirman> but what about the telekenisi?
[0:21:20] <Cerabret100> @AngriestPat yeah i beat it this morning and if you ignore kojima's shitty specific writing, it all works out for the most part
[0:21:20] <laguerrilha> If it ended like Evangelion it would be so fun. Red sky and his giant sister face on the ocean
[0:21:21] <dekkitout> It's a saga on how soon can there be a new way to lasersword
[0:21:22] <faldin> too late, doctor alreay chopped it
[0:21:22] <reonome> star wars finally has a good game

[0:48:41] <%derap41> Why do you like having the game look objectively worse
[0:48:41] <TinalaCoakes> Liking motion blur might be the worst opinion Pat has ever had.
[0:48:42] <Dakuu75> welp, ok.
[0:48:43] <%ArcanumMBD> Motion blur is fine on TVs. I find it more obtrusive when playing on my PC monitor
[0:48:44] <worldbrand> It changes more of the screen from frame to frame, making compression have to do more
[0:48:46] <evbites> Emotes mode?
[0:48:46] <+Punchasaur> Nice?
[0:48:47] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat It makes many people physically ill / sick. (Effects me a lot, but I try to ignore it.)

[0:51:17] <+HellCopter> By Uncharted 4 there were actual reflex things
[0:51:17] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Can you reall ynot fall off? Can you TRY to kill yourself? Will it let you?
[0:51:17] <Vashido22> in AC you an did
[0:51:18] <otakon17> yeah you could fall in AssCreed
[0:51:18] <Psyramics> its just padding thats slightly more interesting than walking down hallways
[0:51:19] <%kingbaconcrispy> Yeah Uncharted platforming losses it's appeal fast. Prince of PErsia though, that's something else. You can actually die.
[0:51:20] <Vashido22> die
[0:51:20] <%joylent_blue> god i thought we were done with this kind of climbing mechanics
[0:51:21] <%jessyg920> I really hope this game continues to be as good as it looks. Guess I'll have to wait for the youtube upload to watch the rest.
[0:51:21] <%CrossCottonwood> To be fair, also just walking is pointless. It's just a way to mix up the pointless
[0:51:21] <Dakuu75> yep
[0:51:22] <+Punchasaur> OH NO THE LEDGE CRUMBLED
[0:51:22] <segbas2004> much better that then falling to your death for no reason
[0:51:22] <%NovaKnightmare> AT TES
[0:51:23] <Tedious_Tickles> The climbing in Uncharted was for casuals to trick them into thinking something intense was happening despite it being on rails
[0:51:23] <dredshift> Totally pointless is apt for everything in Uncharted
[0:51:27] <NotLysander> this looks like uncharted alot
[0:51:27] <%AncelDeLambert> this is feeling very modern Tomb Raider, and I hate that game
[0:51:30] <leinadtonu> no consecuence in missing a jump?
[0:51:30] <otakon17> a literal cutter of ships
[0:51:32] <%NovaKnightmare> LUL

[0:52:13] <NoirePanzer> Kreygasm Republic Star Destroyer
[0:52:14] <%This_is_Marco> I think lack of agency is what makes it feel empty, even though it looks pretty
[0:52:15] <%Nicos143> Jedi can't assert dominance

[0:52:32] <Redmannasah> Steeeeve
[0:52:34] <%deviljhojho_> how come all humans can understand aliens
[0:52:35] <Dragon_Batman> Yea like the series or not the music is great
[0:52:35] <%patriotrenegade> @angriestpat the game was clearly made for 30 FPS, it can’t handle anything above that
[0:52:36] <Admiral_PopnFresh> STEEEEEEEEEEEEVE
[0:52:36] <+Punchasaur> Force T pose is a Jedi master technique
[0:52:37] <%primax104> yes, Mr. Blum

[0:53:09] <Admiral_PopnFresh> 19 year span
[0:53:11] <DeltaD36> It sets the idea that the Empire is dismanteling their old shit and making room for the new shit
[0:53:14] <generalve> YURI
[0:53:15] <%This_is_Marco> its the wild west KKona

[0:53:23] <%patriotrenegade> @angriestpat he runs like he got his lightsaber up his butt
[0:53:25] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> I kinda wish we stayed at this location forever. Like, as a normal person, just fighting as a rebel.
[0:53:25] <+Promessa_EX> so are they scrapping the prequel ships for original ships
[0:53:27] <%joylent_blue> see that sarlacc? don't worry about that
[0:53:28] <Admiral_PopnFresh> @dekkitout please o
[0:53:30] <Admiral_PopnFresh> no
[0:53:32] <@SSaryn> I also actually like the "Use" button being on R3
[0:53:36] <%derap41> Where is OSHA!
[0:53:38] <+gustavozxd> Omega buff arms to do this kind of jump

[0:53:53] <otakon17> friggin' hazard pay
[0:53:53] <+TheNewZealandStory> why do developers keep putting this awful non-gameplay shit climbing in games
[0:53:54] <mayorrev> X WIIIIINGS
[0:53:58] <%SWFanatic> So at the end of this game Vader should kill the protagonist
[0:53:58] <otakon17> THE CLAMPS
[0:53:58] <%honeyman18> How is everyone just blase about this parkour on death mountain.
[0:53:59] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @derap41 I know right? They'd be losing their shit right about now lol.

[0:55:31] <%DSD24> Why is his name Cal
[0:55:31] <DatAsuna> There's a lot of sliding in this game
[0:55:31] <+Daidis> that wizard came from the moon

[1:25:20] <%juxtest> Pockets lost the force in a game of Pazzak
[1:25:20] <+kingcroix> Luke quit
[1:25:20] <%AnIcedCoffee> You close yourself off from the force
[1:25:20] <%ShockzNDrawe> Jedi is more of a religion than anything
[1:25:21] <%miguelrod777> I need to LEVEL UP
[1:25:21] <%Deano8817> tell that to kyle katarn
[1:25:21] <+DesertPenguin> Jedi is a religion

[1:25:23] <@commanderclaw> Kyle Katarn did
[1:25:23] <+Ominnous> yoda did it

[1:25:24] <@SSaryn> Shhhhhh its fine
[1:25:24] <+Diamond_Dynamo> I need Adam to give me clearance to use my force powers
[1:25:24] <TioXyco> Cere looks like Samuel L Jackson but with boobs
[1:25:25] <%TDAWS_MP132> it's like stopping a diet
[1:25:25] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> Its more like a job than a permenant this
[1:25:25] <$StarlitStunner> PTSD
[1:25:25] <%SWFanatic> @FrostMass22 I concur
[1:25:25] <%MagickBurritoh> You stop fuckin with the force
[1:25:25] <%templar010> you can be severed
[1:25:25] <+ghostsofcarcosa> Its a religion you go grey
[1:25:25] <ThirdPersonPhil> you just burn the tree
[1:25:25] <+crowmium> you can
[1:25:25] <transporterthesequel> no it is not
[1:25:26] <Mister_McDerp> according to episode 8 you can
[1:25:26] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> thing
[1:25:26] <%Niney_Who> Okay but why doesn't she have a lightsaber then Skeletor.
[1:25:26] <Dragon_Batman> Well when everyone gets murdered I imagine you do
[1:25:26] <twistedj3ster> they stop doing it ALL THE TIME
[1:25:27] <$OranHexthief> theres a couple ways to do it pat
[1:25:27] <%floralkami> Thats ptsd
[1:25:27] <Virokwet> Luke did it
[1:25:27] <%stemlo_> @AngriestPat Jolee Bindo disagrees. As does Obi Wan and Yoda
[1:25:27] <ape_hawk> its like quitting being a christian
[1:25:27] <+punit216> Her eyes freak me out
[1:25:27] <Bluewolf544> Will probably be a plot point @AngriestPat
[1:25:27] <TwinBat> stahp being ginger pat
[1:25:28] <%mh9s> decided the force was fuckin dumb
[1:25:28] <Redmannasah> Literally Ben kenobi
[1:25:28] <Thorn14> You can sever your connection with the Force.
[1:25:28] <BrownMcgee> yoda quit
[1:25:29] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Sith torture had that result
[1:25:29] <majindusto> HER EYES ARE FREAKY
[1:25:29] <%xtremegamer80> @AngriestPat I mean you can quit being a priest
[1:25:29] <+Siconia> Obi-wan did it
[1:25:29] <%Explodincatz> force neutered
[1:25:30] <+gustavozxd> Kyle Katarn did it
[1:25:30] <secretbosssauce> She ran out of Midiclorians
[1:25:30] <Nina96> vader did @AngriestPat
[1:25:30] <+r_Foeburden87> You just Go Grey
[1:25:31] <JoshyJ> turn in your jedi two week notice
[1:25:31] <%TDAWS_MP132> you stop praticing
[1:25:31] <+Caped_Eggy> You gotta kill at least half the bosses to get fiber connection
[1:25:31] <dresdengh0st> you can be a force user and not a jedi
[1:25:32] <$AtomicExperience> So you won't be doing some Star Killer shit becuase you are not as connected to the force.
[1:25:32] <%MelBrooksKA> Also known as Samus Arius Syndrome
[1:25:33] <+Promessa_EX> swipe
[1:25:33] <Manjove> i guess you have to stop it intentionally
[1:25:33] <BalloniWright> unless you do it to turn evil
[1:25:33] <JittersCaffeine> Mostly because of their "no fucking allowed" rules
[1:25:33] <CelioHogane> SHE DONATED HER MIDICLORIANS!
[1:25:33] <LunarRemix> Yeah I quit bikes, I no longer know how to ride a bike
[1:25:34] <Khorneflakes_> Things like trauma can sever a persons connection
[1:25:34] <%bevyrage> @AngriestPat if you stop believing in the force then you lose your force powers (mostly)
[1:25:34] <dredshift> That's what all the Grey Jedi do, Pat
[1:25:35] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @majindusto 20 people have left the Jedi Order in History
[1:25:35] <%rumtumtugnutz> Only Jizz musicians are jizz wailers
[1:25:36] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat it kinda is the sort of thing you stop doing actually. Either that or you get expelled.
[1:25:36] <kerotuyu> Dooku quit being a Jedi.
[1:25:37] <otakon17> I would think being a Jedi would be like a PART of you
[1:25:37] <%PipIV> Kyle did it all the time
[1:25:38] <%a_lucky_soul> it's like D&D cleric or warlock i guess
[1:25:39] <zenith0111> You're super wrong
[1:25:39] <+LegacyOfTheSith> kotor 2 explains OpieOP
[1:25:40] <%Anime_Flux> We've arrived on Bulgogi
[1:25:42] <%WackyGear> @AngriestPat some peopel just left the order
[1:25:42] <%TIME_PUNCHER> "I quit being psychic"
[1:25:42] <lexitheshark> Her actor is Debra Wilson. Tons of TV and video game credits
[1:25:43] <Namillus> I mean, "being a Jedi" is supposed to be "wander the galaxy helping those in need".
[1:25:43] <+Punchasaur> You will unlock more force by leveling up lol
[1:25:43] <Bearistotle> like in KOTOR 2 when the exile was cut off from the force i guess?
[1:25:43] <startstoprepeat> kotor 2 was all about cutting yourself off from the force
[1:25:44] <otakon17> lol
[1:25:44] <%FrostMass22> @angriestpat In KOTOR 2 people cut themselves off from the force but eh
[1:25:44] <%GarbageQueenEllie> No more Amadama
[1:25:44] <%Alopekis> Bogano
[1:25:45] <Solidnick18> wooo this is a bagano
[1:25:45] <ricotez> oh my god they use the fucking same transitions too
[1:25:45] <+Midashu> maybe if she was a gray jedi who was fed up, but she wants to rebuild the order and says she ISN'T a jedi anymore? wtf is going on...
[1:25:47] <+xBolts4Lifex> wait.........thats your plinkit voice?
[1:25:48] <Edjager97> the last jedi kinda explains it @angriestpat
[1:25:48] <kerotuyu> Anakin stopped being a jedi, too
[1:25:48] <collind99> connection to the force severed
[1:25:49] <@lewdskeletor13> Jedi is a religion, you’re not born as a Jedi
[1:25:50] <@SSaryn> THATS RIGHT JAY
[1:25:52] <Namillus> Kinda hard to do that when the Empire's watching for people doing that.
[1:25:52] <otakon17> Plinkett should do an audio book for Star Wars
[1:25:53] <%CrossCottonwood> I also call things I like stupid to avoid being judged
[1:25:53] <%chrishnaw> The jungles of Russia!
[1:25:54] <%rumtumtugnutz> max reebo was a jizz wailer
[1:25:54] <MessyBristles> you just leave and cut yourself from the force its like becoming a space atheist
[1:25:55] <+drwhofan999> you dont follow the teaching of the Jedi
[1:25:56] <BrownMcgee> Why does he wear one glove
[1:25:57] <Nina96> didnt that one girl from clone wars quit?
[1:25:57] <%Svanyr> inb4 tracker on the ship
[1:25:59] <Admiral_PopnFresh> maybe's she's force sensitive, but is shit with a light saber and left the order when she was young
[1:26:01] <otakon17> not yet they don't
[1:26:01] <+gustavozxd> Kyle Katarn stops and he loses all his cool shit
[1:26:01] <%Alopekis> Yo
[1:26:02] <BrownMcgee> Is he an anime protag
[1:26:02] <+DesertPenguin> Fallen Order means those left from Order 66?
[1:26:04] <%miguelrod777> until the final act
[1:26:05] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Thats right Jay
[1:26:07] <+crowmium> what's that from
[1:26:07] <cat5kable> OH MAN it used a star wars transition, classic screen wipe!

[1:38:49] <zamzoph> His weird Force sensitivity is how we're going to get backstory scenes, isn't it?

[1:55:50] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @ThatGuyfromMars Is there at least Pazaak?
[1:55:53] <mostundesired> If T-pose asserts dominance, does A-pose assert sumbission?

[1:57:38] <Louie_Salmon> Did he just force touch a wall to gain the memories of a wall-running lizard?
[1:57:38] <+Diamond_Dynamo> Because it's a Respawn game, so of course the first ability you unlock is wallrun
[1:57:39] <%Deano8817> eh probably
[1:57:39] <+griffball13> this remind me of psy ops

[1:59:10] <omen_setter> it's an everything stew
[1:59:12] <%JJCheeker> seems like a long time ago
[1:59:15] <+MisterAngryEyes112> It's an amalgamation of a lot of mechanics and does it well, no particular innovation
[1:59:17] <%rumtumtugnutz> Melange E Trois
[1:59:19] <%Explodincatz> best term u guys invented
[1:59:20] <%Agami23> you put all the chunks of other games in, mix it in wlel, get a good ol' gumbo goin'

[1:59:21] <BoomerUnchained> Good old frankengame
[1:59:21] <+VektorTroika> Yo Pat you're getting the lore mixed up. Melange is from Dune
[1:59:24] <Dr_Mooose> not that part though
[1:59:25] <T_Sasquatch> Yea and i hate that
[1:59:27] <@lewdskeletor13> It’s taking a lot of ideas from other games is what you’re saying?
[1:59:28] <mostundesired> Bonfire?
[1:59:30] <+Hoisengineer> worked for dying light
[1:59:30] <Monkeyweed21> STEW WARS
[1:59:30] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> For folks who don't know, gumbo is a meldy stew with rice, beans, meat, veg, and spices.
[1:59:30] <%Nope80808> Was that English?
[1:59:31] <%Alopekis> This is an example of taking good things from various games and making another good game out of them.
[1:59:33] <Cymen90> @AngriestPat Has that not been a thing since action game with "RPG elements"??
[1:59:33] <+Sento_vidya> I hate that cause it usuallyu created unblending emchanics
[1:59:34] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Basically it has a little bit for everyone - Dunkey
[1:59:36] <%cureneckbeard> Parkour!
[1:59:37] <%king_wragles> Pat you okay? Do you smell burnt toast?
[1:59:38] <%PROUD2beGINGER> Melange et trois
[1:59:38] <%Rumbutt> Gamer stew? Sounds gross oroLUL

[1:59:51] <%pilgrimsayswhat> It gumbo
[1:59:51] <%PigGuy800> and strain out an EA that may have gotten in
[1:59:52] <%Nicos143> It takes a lot to make a stew
[1:59:53] <omen_setter> the broth for gamer stew is mountain dew
[1:59:57] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> can you use the force to force your opponent to shit their pants?
[1:59:57] <%Anime_Flux> poor grub-things
[1:59:59] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Anybody know about the Jedi snipers?
[2:00:01] <%Saltmeisterr> pat speak real people language
[2:00:02] <mrmike5150> I can’t beat that damned frog thing!
[2:00:03] <%NovaKnightmare> I bet its a file in the game
[2:00:05] <%wolfofsound> i'm sure they will
[2:00:06] <T_Sasquatch> Just mixing a bunch of things and then there's nothing unique about the game
[2:00:06] <Bigbossman91> @AngriestPat don't forget to scan dead enemies for xp
[2:00:09] <@lewdskeletor13> Man I want a new God of War, gotta see what boi is up to

[2:00:15] <otakon17> I LOVE BESTIARIES
[2:00:16] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @pilgrimsayswhat Some folks just have never had gumbo. I feel sad for them.
[2:00:16] <%ShichiNoBushi> I cut you so bad, you... you wish I no cut you so bad!
[2:00:18] <dekkitout> The Jedi had force-snipers? That surprises me little
[2:00:18] <butthurtdave> but can you force choke a dude and throw your lightsaber at him over and over like a psycho
[2:00:18] <%SWFanatic> "I wanna see you bleed." -Pat 2019
[2:00:21] <%chrishnaw> It's another Metroid Prime ability!
[2:00:23] <otakon17> okay that's it I'm getting this game
[2:00:24] <mankeyfigh> Can YOU NOT??
[2:00:26] <Dakuu75> I need mroe power
[2:00:29] <Ion_Laser> It's not the true Jedi Knight experience until I can hack the limbs off of everything
[2:00:29] <+Punchasaur> Disney sez no
[2:00:36] <%Rumbutt> BD stands for BOY Droid
[2:00:40] <Psyramics> can you force choke a dude and then just send him flying off a cliff to his death?
[2:00:41] <Ion_Laser> And Force Choke enemies of cliffs and ledges
[2:00:42] <otakon17> I'd go max life
[2:00:44] <darkocore> Tells enemy weaknesses too
[2:00:45] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @xtremegamer80 I think there was a lore text written where the Temple Guards wait at the rooftops with their sabers and jump on people
[2:00:49] <Ion_Laser> off of*
[2:00:50] <%PROUD2beGINGER> Is that a DAB

[2:01:20] <mrmike5150> How do you kill that frog monster thing?!?
[2:01:21] <mankeyfigh> If I can’t dismember other people what am I even doing with a lightsaber
[2:01:31] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> if having a high amount of midichlorians means you're stronger with the force, why haven't the sith figured out how to juice themselves up with midichlorian injections?
[2:01:33] <Namillus> Ooh Stinger on a hold input? That seems uncomfortable

[2:02:01] <VirtuaRailith> When do you get Sin Jedi Trigger?
[2:02:09] <%ArcanumMBD> Pat your level up choices are the antithesis to mine. I always max out a thing first, occasionally taking upgrades from other paths
[2:02:09] <%narusao> use the forks Pat
[2:02:10] <Tedious_Tickles> gotta do it in order to maintain the reputation as the OCD Force user
[2:02:11] <Admiral_PopnFresh> BECOME GIANT
[2:02:14] <dekkitout> How has someone in Star Wars never summon-sworded light sabers- wait no, Traya did that
[2:02:14] <%Alopekis> You've already been up there
[2:02:17] <APsaull> how can this beee?!
[2:02:18] <Palmtuna> What's with the blur at the start of the wall run animation?
[2:02:20] <alwayspronking> Prince of Persia?
[2:02:20] <+Punchasaur> All in luck
[2:02:21] <%Alopekis> Oh. That one
[2:02:24] <mankeyfigh> @thatoneguyyousaw I don’t think you can inject midichlorians
[2:02:25] <butthurtdave> i wish they'd put in goofy fail animations like running facefirst into a wall when you miss your jump timing
[2:02:27] <%NovaKnightmare> Anakin?
[2:02:30] <%wolfofsound> hmmm
[2:02:30] <%AnIcedCoffee> People have already made texture mods, so limb cutting soon hopefully

[2:02:37] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> I know what Coruscant is!
[2:02:40] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Everyone hates the Council. They're fuckwads
[2:02:41] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @VirtuaRailith Okay, so is Sin Jedi Trigger just Sith Trigger?
[2:02:45] <mostundesired> Ginger seeking Butt Jedi

[2:02:58] <%Alopekis> @JittersCaffeine There's a lot of Jedi, so I don't think so.
[2:02:59] <%Mekhet09> Time to kill the YOUNGLINGS
[2:03:00] <%Saltmeisterr> Ashoka cool
[2:03:00] <%TIME_PUNCHER> I bet this used to be Darth Boob Troopers home
[2:03:00] <dekkitout> The Council were the supreme dumb dumbs
[2:03:00] <otakon17> yeah it literally JUST came out
[2:03:01] <The7thCrownLessKing> THE JEDI ARE EVIL
[2:03:02] <+VektorTroika> Yo is frustration like a kinda anger? Does Karenism lead to the dark side?

[2:03:21] <%GarbageQueenEllie> I wish there was a Youngling Massacre Simulator
[2:03:24] <%PROUD2beGINGER> What if it was a mimic

[2:03:28] <Thalchampz> eletric bogaloo
[2:03:29] <Shadope342> electric boogaloo
[2:03:30] <otakon17> I wonder if these chests actually have GOOD things in them like actual supplies or XP?
[2:03:30] <uncledoodsauce> if I don't like dark souls I probably won't like this. jedi academy just has the perfect combat system
[2:03:30] <%SWFanatic> KIRYU CHAN
[2:03:32] <combomaniadeluxe> I feel like every good pre original trilogy story involves someone saying fuck the jedi
[2:03:35] <mostundesired> It's not bad.
[2:03:38] <JittersCaffeine> @Alopekis Every main character jedi we see gets mad at the jedi council.
[2:03:39] <%JohnAtDawn> BUT PAT EA BAD
[2:03:40] <%demegodz> This game okay
[2:03:40] <Thalchampz> it aint bad yee
[2:03:42] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> I like that shortcut stuff.
[2:03:42] <%ShockzNDrawe> wowie 30 bucks strident
[2:03:43] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @vektortroika the council would say yes, there is no emotion in a jedi
[2:03:44] <Tedious_Tickles> pretty good so far
[2:03:44] <otakon17> YES
[2:03:45] <%joylent_blue> wish it had less platforming
[2:03:45] <+domic_hrv> it gets better
[2:03:45] <%lLuciid> lLuciid subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[2:03:45] <%JJCheeker> The intro was a little wonky

[2:03:48] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> Does it give you the Big Penis Pat?
[2:03:48] <Admiral_PopnFresh> hey
[2:03:50] <otakon17> but this is a good game
[2:03:50] <SeventyForce> Short cut pr0n
[2:03:51] <pibbleton> Pat only likes it because the protagonist is a red head... WITH A HUGE COCK
[2:03:51] <mostundesired> I'm waiting for it to fall apart.
[2:03:52] <trueherobappo> @AngriestPat Is this gonna be a one shot?
[2:03:53] <%xtremegamer80> @JohnAtDawn But Respawn pretty good
[2:03:53] <butthurtdave> looks like a very ambitious 7/10
[2:03:55] <%a_lucky_soul> there is no EA stink on this
[2:03:56] <+MisterAngryEyes112> It's a good ass gumbo game!
[2:03:56] <majindusto> For Now
[2:03:56] <%JJCheeker> This part is OK
[2:03:57] <%TIME_PUNCHER> @angriestpat can Star Wars have mimics?
[2:03:58] <subjectg> It’s good, but lotta uncharted stuff
[2:04:02] <zipfile777> Fun DansGame
[2:04:02] <otakon17> begone bugs
[2:04:06] <anthonysthename> EA sucks but it's not the developer gusy
[2:04:06] <%Typhaeon> Definitely not because the MC is Young Pat-awan
[2:04:07] <%demegodz> BAITED
[2:04:08] <%lLuciid> Is this star wars meets Dark souls?
[2:04:08] <%nekodelic> @johnatdawn ea bad, respawn good

[2:04:56] <%Alopekis> @lLuciid First off, I thought the first part of your name was an "i" so fuck you for that. Second, it's basically like Sekiro, Uncharted, and Star Wars
[2:04:57] <twistedj3ster> throw a rock at it
[2:04:57] <%ArcanumMBD> That dino would kill itself under its own weight if it weren't for force magic
[2:04:58] <mostundesired> I like that they're implenting Star Wars-esque music. It's usually not this good IMO.
[2:04:58] <%animalxer> look at that dark souls boss
[2:04:58] <%TIME_PUNCHER> KILL IT
[2:05:00] <otakon17> that's the secret boss of the level

[2:05:04] <ScreamLord> Space Dragon
[2:05:05] <+domic_hrv> i love the game just put 8 hours in it
[2:05:07] <CptHarlok> Looks like a practical effect dino and I love it for that.
[2:05:07] <%xtremegamer80> Funny enough, there are "dragons" in Resistance, they lived underground
[2:05:11] <+VektorTroika> @TIME_PUNCHER If a sufficiently large dianoga decides to set up shop in a trash can, I guess it'd be a ghetto mimic
[2:05:11] <+Punchasaur> Dimetrodon?

[2:05:23] <Xiangchang> See that dinosaur over there? You can extinct it.
[2:05:25] <dekkitout> The Xylo Beast might as well be a 'dragon'
[2:05:25] <%Alopekis> No
[2:05:27] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> did the force tell Luke to kill Kylo in his sleep, or what?
[2:05:30] <%animalxer> No, because force PTSD
[2:05:30] <%chrishnaw> Force run broke
[2:05:31] <%GarbageQueenEllie> You're letting him win. He's your son

[2:11:41] <danknugglit> How long is this game roughly?
[2:11:41] <+MisterAngryEyes112> He's not on Jedi Grandmaster, what difficulty is he on?
[2:11:42] <@lewdskeletor13> I imagine it won’t be as strong with other enemies

[2:11:57] <%Laecerelius> If only you had a weapon that could cut through almost anything

[2:12:00] <%Laecerelius> If only
[2:12:01] <%xtremegamer80> @AngriestPat Did you know that there was a Mandalorian Jedi, the only one in its history, that made a black light saber called THE DARK SABER?
[2:12:04] <butthurtdave> if only you had a giant laser sword capable of cutting through almost any material
[2:12:06] <thehashslingingslashers> @angriestpat I think I'm just nitpicky but I don't like that time slows down when you shpuld parry especially being on a high difficulty.
[2:12:07] <gonzy92> @angriestpat scan the dinosaur and everything you ll
[2:12:08] <@lewdskeletor13> @leblanc233 Anything with Star Wars in the title will bring that out

[2:23:22] <%xtremegamer80> @AngriestPat Pat, did you know that there was a Mandalorian Jedi, the only one in its history, who had a lightsaber that was black called "THE DARKSABER?"
[2:23:22] <mostundesired> It matters a little.
[2:23:22] <天使42199> :P
[2:23:22] <Namillus> It's just glass from Umbara

[2:23:32] <%ShockzNDrawe> because STARWARS
[2:23:32] <+domic_hrv> Dathomir
[2:23:33] <%bevyrage> is it any different from going irl 'german bratwurst' or 'nihong steel'?
[2:23:33] <samuelfisk> Umbaran glass would be super strong since those Umbarans love their bubble domes.
[2:23:34] <%kingbaconcrispy> Oh Pat, we've all noticed. Umbaran gamer cube.
[2:23:34] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Legion told me space glass is stupid

[2:23:38] <%InnocentAce> Or steel for Ger-Money
[2:23:39] <%Alopekis> Umbaran glass might be particularly strong
[2:23:39] <%MonsieurHedge> french onion soup
[2:23:40] <jimmypurple> Oh dog, weve been knew.
[2:23:40] <AmericanaRed> PAT RUINS EVERYTHING
[2:23:41] <%cureneckbeard> but pat, umbaran glass is better and more resistant to shattering.

[2:23:47] <butthurtdave> Get your flux capacitor and jam it into the orbital drive
[2:23:48] <+Opalance> Why would they feel the need to specify a type of glass if that's the only type they have?

[2:25:59] <%chrishnaw> Do they change how it acts, or just appearance?
[2:25:59] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> The planet selection is like the Mass Effect 3 endings. You want Blue, Yellow, or Red?

[2:26:21] <%Stan_Van01> Wonder how big his number will get

[2:26:24] <Badgerconda_> he stuck the blade right through the fucking ceiling
[2:26:24] <%Laecerelius> Look at your lightsaber as it slices through the ship

[2:27:03] <T_Sasquatch> Why would you THINK that .....
[2:27:03] <dekkitout> But can it be a Malachorian lightsaber (Kylo Ren's)
[2:27:03] <%PROUD2beGINGER> There's room on the table for it too
[2:27:05] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> oh god, I hate that look
[2:27:05] <%RyanDD781> green blade
[2:27:07] <%Saltmeisterr> Cool
[2:27:07] <otakon17> >stupid >the classic candle emitter
[2:27:08] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> @AngriestPat single bladed saber master race
[2:27:08] <transporterthesequel> Yeah that explains why the top was so huge
[2:27:09] <%aslfrasle> Double-bladed lighsaber is always cooler than two lightsabers.
[2:27:10] <%arancet> @AngriestPat omg i love stab flashlights
[2:27:14] <%TheAsianAvenger96> that so ugly
[2:27:15] <trianglehat> candle stick
[2:27:17] <Bluewolf544> Its 100% double holy fuck
[2:27:18] <Tedious_Tickles> it looks like the mouthpiece to a Tuba
[2:27:19] <Pnutz409> It was Cal in the spaceship with the candlestick!
[2:27:19] <otakon17> I don't know but that makes PERFECT sense
[2:27:23] <%JJCheeker> vineTommy
[2:27:23] <%doc_ock_rokc> @aslfrasle You are both wrong and wrong
[2:27:28] <blackesteagle> UI foreshadowing* :P
[2:27:30] <%Swish19XX> Is it gonna be that you found Darth Mauls lightsaber or some shit
[2:27:31] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @Tedious_Tickles You're super right!
[2:27:33] <%arcaderabbit48> But what about General Grievous who wields like 6?
[2:27:33] <AzirothTheGreat> I wonde what planet has that?
[2:27:33] <$Yakobro> single
[2:27:33] <%xtremegamer80> @AngriestPat Pat, did you know that there was a Mandalorian Jedi, the only one in its history, who had a lightsaber that was black called "THE DARKSABER?"
[2:27:36] <%PROUD2beGINGER> ye
[2:27:37] <%XeroSigmaPrime> WHAT ABOUT TWO CURVED?!
[2:27:38] <BoomerUnchained> two > double
[2:27:38] <ape_hawk> dual wielding?
[2:27:38] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat there's no such thing as a bad choice for lightsabers
[2:27:39] <+shnoz_berries> Yuhh
[2:27:40] <mor3gan> double blade is better
[2:27:40] <%Typhaeon> Two one-handed is cooler
[2:27:40] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> I like the double sided dildo
[2:27:41] <%DSD24> Two Lightsabers
[2:27:41] <AmericanaRed> TWO LIGHTSABERS
[2:27:41] <Hollowknight45> yep
[2:27:41] <Namillus> Okay to be fair
[2:27:41] <%RyanDD781> single is best
[2:27:42] <tmix1600> Can you change protags outfit?
[2:27:42] <%Alopekis> I really like the staff
[2:27:42] <%g_rimbo> Why not two lightsabers that can combine into one bigger lightsaber
[2:27:43] <%MagickBurritoh> 2 better than dumb staffsaber
[2:27:44] <transporterthesequel> Yes
[2:27:44] <MadDesperado13> yesh
[2:27:44] <mostundesired> DISAGREE
[2:27:44] <HeadsHeldHigh> Where the fuck are the GREATSABERS
[2:27:44] <DatAsuna> I love saber spears
[2:27:45] <%RyanDD781> nah
[2:27:46] <T_Sasquatch> Two is always cooler
[2:27:46] <skeletonknifefight> what about a big lightsaber that splits into 2
[2:27:46] <Bluewolf544> True
[2:27:46] <mor3gan> NOOO
[2:27:46] <lyzejag> no
[2:27:46] <天使42199> true
[2:27:46] <waifoong98> dual >>> 2 bladed
[2:27:47] <Mister_McDerp> yeah
[2:27:47] <+shnoz_berries> No doubt
[2:27:47] <aracon_> yeah
[2:27:47] <$Yakobro> no
[2:27:48] <dekkitout> Then there's Pong Krell's lighsabers
[2:27:48] <Badgerconda_> WRONG
[2:27:48] <%a_lucky_soul> I like dooku's design
[2:27:48] <%bevyrage> agreed
[2:27:49] <otakon17> Lightclaymore
[2:27:49] <trianglehat> eh
[2:27:49] <%TDAWS_MP132> eh

[2:27:50] <Virokwet> sure
[2:27:50] <robwob2016> What about 2 Big lightsabers
[2:27:50] <%Maids4lyfe> true
[2:27:51] <+scarabswarms> yoda's tampon lightsaber is the best one
[2:27:51] <%GarbageQueenEllie> What about a saber and GUN
[2:27:51] <Baeltyr> noo not always
[2:27:51] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Single saber is dumb
[2:27:52] <+palebluedots> knife sabers
[2:27:53] <bleugh> No
[2:27:53] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> @AngriestPat why don't they have shields?
[2:27:53] <@commanderclaw> Nah
[2:27:53] <+Link232> Yes
[2:27:53] <+kd0g_> What about 2 big lightsabers
[2:27:54] <Fryclan> yeah
[2:27:54] <aeonicvector> now what about lightsabre and parrying lightsabre?
[2:27:54] <%RyanDD781> single is best
[2:27:54] <%TaifuDragon> FUCK YOU SINGLE SABER IS BEST
[2:27:54] <+nirvana227> i love all
[2:27:55] <%xtremegamer80> But what about the DARK SABER?
[2:27:56] <%Swish19XX> 4 better than 2
[2:27:56] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat What about Light Whips?
[2:27:56] <Namillus> This interface spoiler has like tripled my enthusiasm for this game
[2:27:56] <blackesteagle> Dual Wield is coolest
[2:27:57] <%goose_attack_almanac> Where is my Light-Battleax
[2:27:57] <+Fenlig> 2 is the dumbest shit
[2:27:57] <KattyCitty> zweihander-saber all the way
[2:27:57] <+Diamond_Dynamo> Do the Ventris thing, and get 2 that can combine into 1 double sided
[2:27:57] <%g_rimbo> Whip saber
[2:27:57] <Namillus> Also
[2:27:58] <%cureneckbeard> why don't they just make a lightsaber that's like 20 feet long
[2:27:58] <%RobotPancake> Ahsoka Tano dual wield for the win!!!
[2:27:58] <%arcaderabbit48> @AngriestPat What about a robot wielding 6 at once?
[2:27:58] <butthurtdave> i want more unorthodox lightsaber shit, gimme some lightsaber nunchuks dammit
[2:27:58] <aracon_> dual wielding light sabers is sick
[2:27:58] <corn_dad> Lightsaber gun
[2:27:59] <ape_hawk> what about light daggers?
[2:27:59] <%doc_ock_rokc> I want two light sabers that inter connect to make a BIG LIGHT SABER
[2:27:59] <@Fuggins4U> Lightsaber + Vibrowhip
[2:27:59] <+domic_hrv> Dathomir
[2:27:59] <Tedious_Tickles> how about TWO double sided lightsabers
[2:28:00] <+Reizie_Etherealm> No doubt no doubt no doubt
[2:28:00] <%XeroSigmaPrime> what about TWO SABERS WITH CROSSHILTS
[2:28:01] <%Neo_Kaiser> So Pat prefers combo lightsaber over big number lightsaber?
[2:28:01] <+Midashu> Should try for a saber and force-shield in a future game
[2:28:01] <dekkitout> Those things were lightsaber/vlubs
[2:28:02] <%MagickBurritoh> No single is better than staff
[2:28:02] <T_Sasquatch> DUAL WEILD
[2:28:02] <%Typhaeon> Double-bladed was only cool in Phantasy Star Online
[2:28:02] <Lenmutt> Ventress style 2 in 1
[2:28:02] <Whyverns> WHERE ARE THE ZWEI LIGHT SABERS
[2:28:03] <%Laecerelius> Ultra Greatsaber. It was too big to be a lightsaber, too bright, too sabery!
[2:28:03] <blackorchidKI2> Unless you're really proficient in using one lightsaber.
[2:28:03] <+punit216> Lightesaber and a gun
[2:28:03] <worldbrand> nah light hammer
[2:28:04] <Admiral_PopnFresh> I like sing over double ended
[2:28:04] <MSCanyon> not unless you have a cool curved lightsaber like dooku
[2:28:04] <Monkeyweed21> LIGHTSABER ARMOR
[2:28:04] <%DSD24> Doublebladed was
[2:28:04] <Namillus> What about a lightsaber with a stun pistol hilt
[2:28:04] <%chrishnaw> Vibro blades are pretty fuckin cool too
[2:28:04] <Psyramics> what about 2 double lightsabers
[2:28:04] <HeadsHeldHigh> We need greasabers
[2:28:05] <+Link232> Duelists were trash, duel-wield or bust
[2:28:05] <Dwarven_Gaming> how about 2 that JOIN into a double
[2:28:05] <+Reizie_Etherealm> For sure for sure for sure
[2:28:05] <%g_rimbo> WHIP SABER
[2:28:06] <Commander_Spyke> depends on how you use the single blade
[2:28:06] <AmericanaRed> TWO DIFFERENT COLORS LIGHTSABERS
[2:28:08] <RushUnplugged> who is cooler, the guy that needs 2 blades, or the guy that kicks his ass with one?
[2:28:09] <nobody12349> I like the single lightsaber cause I like the fancy fencing and the classic feel
[2:28:09] <Bluewolf544> Dual saber makes your pp bigger @AngriestPat
[2:28:11] <HeadsHeldHigh> greatsabers
[2:28:12] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Dooku's "curved for his pleasure" is pretty alright too
[2:28:12] <Pnutz409> munnies
[2:28:12] <otakon17> it has LISTINGS
[2:28:13] <%VantomPayne> but you cant do the Obiwan stance with 2 sabers
[2:28:14] <%Alopekis> 43 chests
[2:28:14] <%SWFanatic> Go to Blighttown
[2:28:14] <aracon_> and general grievous quad wielding light sabers is even cooler
[2:28:15] <otakon17> that's greats
[2:28:16] <bleugh> curved light saber Kreygasm
[2:28:16] <Aydarkzero> Ratchet & Clank Kreygasm
[2:28:16] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Saber in one hand, han solo blaster in the other, true Rand style
[2:28:17] <jimmypurple> Dude i want a like Light-Claymore
[2:28:17] <%arcaderabbit48> What about a Light Greatsaber?
[2:28:17] <mankeyfigh> Bigger lightsaber?
[2:28:21] <+domic_hrv> Go to Dathomir
[2:28:21] <MidnightBurst12> we can all agree that the light whip is some dumb shit
[2:28:23] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> how does Rei's folded lightsaber supposed to work?
[2:28:23] <%DSD24> Doublebladed had sick combos in Academy
[2:28:24] <%RyanDD781> red planet
[2:28:24] <mield916> dual lightsaber deals less damage per hit
[2:28:25] <zmuno> !uptime
[2:28:25] <Manooz> GO GO DATHOMIR
[2:28:25] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 28m.
[2:28:26] <+TheBitingIrish> I like 1 long saber and 1 short
[2:28:27] <Zebroneath> If only this was shown in the trailer
[2:28:27] <+psychocalibur> metroid prime like
[2:28:27] <Clowns> dual lightsabers are overdone
[2:28:27] <%AnIcedCoffee> Go to Dathomir
[2:28:28] <%g_rimbo> DATHOMIR
[2:28:29] <%TheAsianAvenger96> go to dathomir to fix saber
[2:28:29] <skeletonknifefight> poetry
[2:28:29] <%juxtest> Spherical light saber
[2:28:29] <otakon17> Lightspears
[2:28:30] <%PROUD2beGINGER> Zippo
[2:28:30] <AzirothTheGreat> Red planet
[2:28:31] <worldbrand> A lightsaber but its like those multi color pens so you can use one of three lightsabers
[2:28:31] <%v1Ables> the only time a single lightsabe is cooled than either is when the specific jedi weilding it is being like CRAZY good with it in comparison to the dual, double lightsaber wielders
[2:28:32] <+shnoz_berries> Lightsaber wayyyy better than no lightsaber
[2:28:32] <+Opalance> Dang, they need some google map images of that place
[2:28:32] <otakon17> oh shit
[2:28:32] <%ShichiNoBushi> Said Dr. Suess
[2:28:33] <%RyanDD781> dathomir
[2:28:33] <BagofBones42> Double Lightsaber is fun as hell in Jedi Academy and is Revan's prefered style
[2:28:36] <Clowns> single lightsabers are now back in style
[2:28:39] <mankeyfigh> Aren’t the lightsabers roughly the same size chat?
[2:28:41] <nuane> space nazis
[2:28:41] <%Swish19XX> As dumb as it is, I like Kylo Rens
[2:28:43] <BagofBones42> And hey Steve Blum

[2:28:50] <dukenux> TRESH
[2:28:50] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> The light whip was the dumbest shit, thank god Mickey Mouse made that shit non-cannon
[2:28:51] <Mister_McDerp> the empire did nothing wrong
[2:28:52] <+phamchri> go dathomier
[2:28:53] <bleugh> juggle three lightsabers
[2:28:53] <%Alopekis> You can't do this No matter how much you try So come back later You dumb, idiot guy
[2:28:56] <blackesteagle> lightsabers were more charming in Kotor games

[2:29:34] <Bigbossman91> @Whiskey_T_Foxtrot Star Wars has always been political
[2:29:35] <+Opalance> What would be the possible use for the shape of that ship and the huge top part?
[2:29:35] <%arcaderabbit48> Maybe there just shouldn't be jedi? You know what true balance is? Zero
[2:29:35] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @xtremegamer80 I'm not familiar with this. Are you talking about those weird bugs that couldn't be cut by lightsabers?
[2:29:35] <%decisivelynameless> should've gone to Dathomir
[2:29:37] <poweredscoot> Vote for Papa Palpatine

[2:29:39] <samuelfisk> Palpatine is a right crowdpleaser he is
[2:29:40] <nuane> @Whiskey_T_Foxtrot The Empire is an obvious analogue to Nazi Germany
[2:29:43] <%RyanDD781> in return of the jedi small alien dude and lando flew the shhip
[2:29:45] <otakon17> TO THE EYE OF THE STORM

[2:29:51] <Tedious_Tickles> This is on PC @Swish19XX
[2:29:52] <%xtremegamer80> @King_Wolf_Rigger No like a suit with lightsaber dealies sticking out of it
[2:29:53] <%Alopekis> This ends with Cal beheading the Emperor and taking his place on the throne.
[2:29:54] <%deviljhojho_> monkaS
[2:29:56] <%ivansonic08> Is combat good?
[2:29:57] <%Swish19XX> @Ion_Laser Cool, thanks
[2:29:57] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @XeroSigmaPrime But then he'll be stronger than ever
[2:29:57] <butthurtdave> I want you to step out of the ship and Vader's just there jacking off into the wind
[2:29:58] <blackorchidKI2> I hate how the alien's head is bigger than his body. It looks so dumb.

[2:31:53] <hawkofgp> Where's Kyle Katarn?
[2:31:54] <dekkitout> In cannon it briefly did, in Legends yeah of course
[2:31:56] <%debugdrawray_> it used to in the old extended universe
[2:31:57] <DatAsuna> MULTIPLE TIMES
[2:31:57] <@commanderclaw> Fuck Canon
[2:31:58] <rockmansrb2> Talk to him again
[2:31:59] <Namillus> Luke built one in the EU and it was fine
[2:31:59] <+Opalance> Not the Sparksteel Mantis?
[2:32:00] <+Siconia> Luke fucking tries
[2:32:03] <+Siconia> Doesn't work
[2:32:03] <%Typhaeon> They called the prequels pretty much
[2:32:04] <Cymen90> What? MULTIPLE TIMES
[2:32:05] <+Punchasaur> Do they even have mantises
[2:32:05] <%SWFanatic> @hawkofgp Disney Killed him
[2:32:06] <%snow_bush> Yes
[2:32:07] <%snow_bush> Many
[2:32:07] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> Kyle Katarn is non canon
[2:32:07] <+VektorTroika> Back in the old days it did
[2:32:08] <%RyanDD781> they do but it fucks up again
[2:32:08] <Delenay> they are
[2:32:09] <MidnightBurst12> yep
[2:32:10] <%snow_bush> Many Times
[2:32:11] <+nirvana227> true
[2:32:11] <%Alopekis> The Jedi Order was corrupt and incompetent
[2:32:13] <%TDAWS_MP132> big yep
[2:32:13] <DatAsuna> THE JEDI FALLEN PART AND REFORM LIKE 5 TIMES
[2:32:16] <%doc_ock_rokc> It kinda does in Legends but because Luke isn't a great teacher it factures into a new sith shit
[2:32:16] <nobody12349> Just like the Prequels
[2:32:16] <+griffball13> because they lazy
[2:32:18] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Jedi didn't do nuffin
[2:32:18] <dekkitout> Jedi are why Mandalorians exist
[2:32:19] <%NovaKnightmare> The Jedi Order dies constantly
[2:32:19] <%GarbageQueenEllie> GOOD. That's a true to life lesson
[2:32:20] <ape_hawk> PALPATINE WAS RIGHT
[2:32:21] <%RyanTheRecluse> For a few years
[2:32:21] <hawkofgp> @SWFanatic ...oh...
[2:32:22] <%deviljhojho_> buncha slack jawed imbeciles
[2:32:23] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> JEDI DESERVED TO DIE AND I HOPE THEY BURN IN HELL
[2:32:24] <+Daidis> grey jedi is best jedi
[2:32:25] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Yeah, they are aggresively ingorant and dumb.
[2:32:26] <DisGuyOvahEre> the jedi order does restore in the original EU but not in this new one. it never gets restored
[2:32:26] <%Agami23> lets not forget forcing children to never have any emotion ever.
[2:32:26] <Tedious_Tickles> Jedi are quite literally a religion who contradicts themselves constantly
[2:32:28] <%doc_ock_rokc> Kreia was right
[2:32:29] <%cureneckbeard> they sent the jedi to settle that trade order
[2:32:29] <%a_lucky_soul> Revan was right all along
[2:32:30] <%NovaKnightmare> this is like the 10th time theyve died out
[2:32:30] <iamyoungdabnow> Jedi are dummies
[2:32:30] <%ImmaCanuck> dems LUL
[2:32:33] <+mrbleeeh> IN MY EYES THE JEDI ARE EVIL
[2:32:33] <CrypticMochi> Built for failure
[2:32:33] <%Alopekis> Not all Jedi were bad but the Jedi Order was incredibly incompetent.
[2:32:33] <%Typhaeon> Kreia did nothing wrong
[2:32:34] <%doc_ock_rokc> Kreia was RIGHT
[2:32:35] <+domic_hrv> fatty
[2:32:36] <%GoogleyGareth> That's what they get for not letting Anakin in the council
[2:32:36] <Tedious_Tickles> Sith > Jedi
[2:32:37] <+nirvana227> mandoloarian had the right to fight back
[2:32:37] <%honeyman18> Also Slave monks
[2:32:38] <MidnightBurst12> they die and reform and fuck up in the same exact way
[2:32:38] <%Rumbutt> The Jedi and the Sith are both wrong: middle road is the way to go
[2:32:39] <thetruenicster> #RevanWasRight
[2:32:39] <butthurtdave> It's why the Grays are so much better
[2:32:39] <waifoong98> they were too busy smelling their own farts Kappa
[2:32:40] <closetgremlin12> Revan did nothing wrong
[2:32:41] <%juxtest> Somebody should probably do something about this Sith thing.
[2:32:42] <T_Sasquatch> Its almost like the jedi aren't completely right
[2:32:42] <skeletonknifefight> grey jedi are edgelord mary sues
[2:32:42] <+TechnicolorNinja> That is why the force needed to be balanced
[2:32:42] <%DSD24> Revan was the coolest

[2:33:07] <DisGuyOvahEre> the jedi order did nothing wrong
[2:33:09] <poweredscoot> also no sex
[2:33:13] <%xtremegamer80> @AngriestPat Pat, did you know that there was a Mandalorian Jedi, the only one in its history, who had a lightsaber that was black called "THE DARKSABER?"
[2:33:13] <Rotabrutsama> THE JEDI ARE ASSHOLES
[2:33:13] <based_versauen> So many people in chat. Such unreadable.

[2:33:19] <T_Sasquatch> The jedi are the reason anakin turned into an emotional baby
[2:33:20] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> I like how the original Sith were fucking sorcerers
[2:33:23] <+CountNebula> Kreia did nothing wrong.
[2:33:25] <+VektorTroika> @DisGuyOvahEre it's true, cuz they didn't do much of anything
[2:33:25] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Kreia wanted to reform the Jedi, and also maybe kill the Force. Whichever works
[2:33:27] <%Laecerelius> Poncho materials!
[2:33:29] <%SWFanatic> PONCHO UP
[2:33:32] <%doc_ock_rokc> @DisGuyOvahEre The Jedi order did nothing in general
[2:33:32] <ScreamLord> "Wha Happun?" Said the Jedi Order as they're destoryed for the 800th time by a problem they could have easily solved if they acted faster than not at all
[2:33:34] <%Typhaeon> Bravo, another road worker getup
[2:33:35] <%SWFanatic> pfffff

[2:40:17] <dekkitout> The only clones left are Boba, Rex and two others who's names I forgot
[2:40:17] <+CountNebula> Was there an actual reason Papa Palpatine replaced all the clones with people who can't fire for shit? Couldn't he just grow more?
[2:40:18] <%Alopekis> @Nina96 First generation were, I believe. They came in when the Empire was first established and then were phased out because it was unsustainable since they couldn't make more.
[2:40:23] <%RobotPancake> yea after the empire took over they started open recruiting. Clones were mostly for the purge
[2:40:23] <+fromnibelheim> he sounds like a tiny cow mooing
[2:40:23] <%WackyGear> @AngriestPat just go and pick him up
[2:40:25] <%DSD24> @SarcFa It cuts animals and droids but not humans

[2:40:51] <%Faustgesicht> Is game good?
[2:40:51] <@lewdskeletor13> @typhaeon The explanation most often given is imperial propaganda mixed with the fact that people think the Jedi were hoaxes created by the Republic. Most people in the galaxy would never even see a Jedi in their lifetime
[2:40:52] <T_Sasquatch> He just cuts them down silently. Hardcore
[2:40:53] <%cureneckbeard> apatGib

[2:41:40] <otakon17> @CountNebula clones are used sparingly but the shoot for shit thing is a theory is it's literally the Force messing with their ability to aim at certain people. Plus blasters are generally inaccurate

[2:46:14] <isboombox> one of my cats have been having that issue every now and then as well, do I need to find specific food that has extra salt or can I add some to their food myself? They eat dry food @AngriestPat

[2:48:46] <CommanderCOOL> i love this game so much. its feels like sands of time mixed with sekiro combat.
[2:48:47] <otakon17> man
[2:48:57] <otakon17> I ALMOST feel sorry for these Stormtroopers
[2:48:57] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @King_Wolf_Rigger aaaaaaaaa
[2:49:04] <Mister_McDerp> they got this
[2:49:05] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @GarbageQueenEllie IT IS!
[2:49:05] <%konekoryugamine> FUCKING A
[2:49:06] <TikanZK> NOT AN EASY TARGET GUYS
[2:49:09] <%Anime_Flux> wow that stormtrooper was confident...
[2:49:09] <JT137> smoking sick style
[2:49:11] <%konekoryugamine> NICE ONE
[2:49:11] <otakon17> they have little talks beforehand
[2:49:12] <Gorgen> YURI NO
[2:49:15] <trianglehat> g get the jedi
[2:49:22] <+yoshkosh20> what difficulty we playin on?
[2:49:22] <Tedious_Tickles> I'm rooting for the Storm Troopers, they need the support
[2:49:23] <%konekoryugamine> Oh man this looks fun - OH NO IT LOOKS FUN
[2:49:25] <+earthboy2k> they're as useless as the phantom menace droids
[2:49:28] <%Reaviar> i dont think crippled is the right word
[2:49:31] <%konekoryugamine> I didn't want this game to succeed!
[2:49:32] <Monkeyweed21> wow
[2:49:34] <extradopeness> This looks great wow
[2:49:34] <+gantz_zero> they talk to each other a surprising amount @AngriestPat
[2:49:37] <thetruenicster> He Tposed Again
[2:49:37] <+Evergreen_45> this is some stiff dialogue
[2:49:38] <%SWFanatic> Jedi Murderer
[2:49:39] <Mister_McDerp> maybe they'll win next time
[2:49:41] <pantherpiss2> so their bodies can take light sabers
[2:49:43] <%RyanDD781> @AngriestPat Hold block to block
[2:49:43] <Essixian> Can you not dismember people? I'm sure I saw that in a trailer.
[2:49:44] <otakon17> good parry Pat
[2:49:44] <Hellarussian> YEYEYE
[2:49:44] <@lewdskeletor13> Oh man you can really that Yuri scream
[2:49:45] <dekkitout> It must really suck to be a Stormtrooper and not know shit all about what Jedi are capable of
[2:49:47] <mostundesired> Nice.
[2:49:49] <T_Sasquatch> The lack of dismemberment is saddening
[2:49:49] <%Alopekis> He took down the shooty bois!
[2:49:51] <otakon17> uh oh
[2:49:51] <Monkeyweed21> whens the Owen Wilson mod
[2:49:52] <%konekoryugamine> They counter!
[2:49:53] <otakon17> tougher scout
[2:49:54] <%konekoryugamine> They fucking COUNTER!
[2:49:55] <+Evergreen_45> I CAN'T LAND A HIT.
[2:49:56] <CommanderCOOL> This game is fun. on Grandmaster its fucking TOUGH
[2:50:00] <otakon17> his pauldron denotes him as tougher
[2:50:02] <%honeyman18> I just want them to beg for life, at about 5% troopers left
[2:50:05] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> you'd think they'd surrender after you killed 10 of their buddies
[2:50:05] <+Ell1ot> identify yourself... BANG!
[2:50:05] <Tedious_Tickles> I really like that the grunts have so much dialogue
[2:50:10] <%juxtest> Scan his butt
[2:50:10] <qsirius> Scan his butt
[2:50:11] <%konekoryugamine> Holy CRAP when do you go Darth Vader for it
[2:50:13] <energywarning> scan his bum
[2:50:16] <Mister_McDerp> pauldron means he's cool
[2:50:17] <%konekoryugamine> And jsut choke slam someone
[2:50:20] <Dehlome> hes got the orange thing that means hes a cool guy
[2:50:22] <%pilgrimsayswhat> Adapt the SBFP XCOM voices mod for the troopers
[2:50:23] <+earthboy2k> no dismemberment :(
[2:50:27] <%RyanDD781> Hold block to block
[2:50:29] <%konekoryugamine> DId you just fucking light a TORCH
[2:50:31] <%Alopekis> Pauldron means he makes more money
[2:50:32] <%Bt_Robot> You miss a chest?
[2:50:33] <%Anime_Flux> I really hope there's a dark side path in this game
[2:50:33] <+yoshkosh20> the fighting looks really grounded. I'm kinda suprised to not see any high flying acrobatics
[2:50:36] <indigobat91> i hate that human enemies make the lightsabre a glowing baseball bat
[2:50:38] <Rotabrutsama> hmmmmm
[2:50:40] <%UmoLoco> UmoLoco subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months, currently on a 1 month streak! Yo Pat is this game fun?

[2:50:46] <LeBlanc233> almost
[2:50:46] <+gantz_zero> @Tedious_Tickles my favorite so far is when there's one storm trooper left and he's just like "I knew it would end like this!"
[2:50:48] <ape_hawk> they sent them to camps for... concentration?
[2:50:49] <Rotabrutsama> china
[2:50:50] <%SWFanatic> the empire did nothing wrong
[2:50:56] <DrunkenEdubs> @angriestpat play more death stranding you :)
[2:50:57] <+Blargimazombie> No way
[2:50:59] <theKingRamses> no the jedi are evil
[2:50:59] <WanderingBard> But Thrawn though...
[2:51:01] <Tedious_Tickles> @gantz_zero that's a nice touch, love that kind of stuff
[2:51:02] <%Faustgesicht> So is this just Star Wars: Shadow of Mordor?
[2:51:04] <extradopeness> La Sociedad
[2:51:08] <Hellarussian> from my point of view Smellmo is evil
[2:51:08] <qsirius> I love camp!
[2:51:10] <+earthboy2k> maybe PC mods will add dismemberment
[2:51:10] <%konekoryugamine> The Empire is just another corporation! Fuck it!
[2:51:11] <+grim_abel> Space Hobo
[2:51:12] <otakon17> Star Wars Soulsvania
[2:51:14] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> I think I prefer the plain Jacket look
[2:51:15] <collind99> @angriestpat how are you liking the game so far
[2:51:15] <+yoshkosh20> sweet. you can be the jedi with no name.
[2:51:19] <ape_hawk> no, this is star warsvania
[2:51:22] <+gantz_zero> Dark Star Soul Wars
[2:51:23] <%UmoLoco> @Faustgesicht Thats what i was thinking!
[2:51:24] <+zombiedinosour> have to go good by lunch break over
[2:51:24] <Badgerconda_> BABYJAR
[2:51:25] <samuelfisk> Thrawn is just Rommel
[2:51:25] <mostundesired> Peepoops?
[2:51:27] <%Alopekis> @Faustgesicht More like Star Wars: Sekiro Uncharted
[2:51:33] <%Alopekis> He's right
[2:51:35] <+OkamiDude15> soultroid wars
[2:51:36] <%konekoryugamine> Damn it this is WAY better than it needs to be and I hate that I like it
[2:51:39] <BoomerUnchained> steal his blaster
[2:51:40] <Bigbossman91> @Faustgesicht no more like Dark Souls
[2:51:41] <%Faustgesicht> Aight, I can dig it
[2:51:41] <DrunkenEdubs> okay thnks LUL
[2:51:42] <%Alopekis> No reason to be mad at him when he didn't do anything
[2:51:46] <%GarbageQueenEllie> I always love waiting and listening in on enemy dialogue.
[2:51:46] <otakon17> woo another skill point HIT THE BONFIRE
[2:51:47] <+Ell1ot> if the Empire took over, wouldn't that mean the galaxy would be unified and there wouldn't need to be anymore fighting?
[2:51:49] <%DracaenaLeaf> Jobbers
[2:51:51] <+yoshkosh20> I wish nioh 2 was here
[2:51:55] <%Typhaeon> Pretty bog standard stormtroopers

[2:52:03] <mostundesired> The T-pose is real.
[2:52:05] <Hellarussian> F
[2:52:05] <%king_wragles> I SAW THE T POSE
[2:52:05] <ape_hawk> did he slide for no reason?
[2:52:06] <Tedious_Tickles> rip
[2:52:06] <mostundesired> LUL
[2:52:08] <%konekoryugamine> @gantz_zero Right?!
[2:52:10] <%SWFanatic> collect cosmetics to defeat the emperor
[2:52:11] <mield916> look for orange crates
[2:52:11] <butthurtdave> so do the lightsaber parts give you any bonuses or boosts or are they purely cosmetic?
[2:52:12] <internetexplorer11> f
[2:52:13] <+Mitchellsocks> This place reminds me so much of the Undead Burgh, don't laugh, I
[2:52:13] <mankeyfigh> IF YOU SAY SO????
[2:52:15] <%Ner234> "FUN"
[2:52:16] <cheesedburgers> This game is forever linked to the time it was “announced” by dejected Vince in the front row of the most boring show of all time I can’t think of anything else
[2:52:18] <TikanZK> being able to customize your lightsaber has to be one of the coolest parts of this game easily
[2:52:21] <+yoshkosh20> did he think he was gonna win a duel with a jedi?
[2:52:22] <%invisi_bliss> You got
[2:52:24] <Essixian> F U N
[2:52:26] <%invisi_bliss> NO CHANCE
[2:52:29] <%xvalltendo> @AngriestPat so I take it this game is better than Force Unleashed?
[2:52:32] <%Lambda_man> is that yuri lowenthal?
[2:52:34] <%monaman1> Also I love Elmo. Cheer100
[2:52:39] <mankeyfigh> JOBBERS
[2:52:40] <%cureneckbeard> all the jedis were killed so everybody assumes they're chumps
[2:52:44] <%rbakervv> @butthurtdave cosmetic only
[2:52:46] <%Alopekis> @Ell1ot Except for when people decide they don't want to live under a crazy dictator who looks like a nutsack.
[2:52:46] <mankeyfigh> All of em
[2:52:46] <dekkitout> Moar blocks
[2:52:47] <%Laecerelius> block gooder
[2:52:52] <otakon17> I dunno man Force Unleashed was pretty good
[2:52:53] <mostundesired> That's a hot take and a half.
[2:52:54] <%Bane_Kaikyo> I really liked Force Unleashed imo
[2:52:56] <trianglehat> neat
[2:52:58] <%a_lucky_soul> more grounded so to speak
[2:53:01] <+yoshkosh20> I forgot about order 66
[2:53:02] <hunter4813> These are still clones yeah?
[2:53:03] <FirearmsInstructor> @Laecerelius more betterer
[2:53:03] <T_Sasquatch> You LIE
[2:53:07] <%konekoryugamine> Pretty sure some Star Wars fans are gonna tear your ass for that one
[2:53:07] <mankeyfigh> Parry this YOU FUCKING CASUAL
[2:53:10] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @Alopekis But I love nutsack dictators!
[2:53:11] <Essixian> Using your lightsaber as a torch? I like it.
[2:53:12] <+gantz_zero> did you opt to match your light saber to your beard? @AngriestPat
[2:53:17] <ChoculaUltra> I wonder if Pat's going to feel the same way when the backtracking starts.
[2:53:18] <collind99> The force unleashed isn’t a good game
[2:53:20] <%RyanDD781> I love using a lightsabre as a light source
[2:53:21] <dekkitout> There's only 4 clones left @hunter4813
[2:53:23] <ScreamLord> Force Unleashed was like classic God of War but in Star Wars
[2:53:23] <+Blargimazombie> Pat doesn't like the Force Unleashed so of course he says that
[2:53:24] <%konekoryugamine> OH GOD DAMMIT why does it LOOK SO GOOD?!
[2:53:27] <Tedious_Tickles> I'm very surprised there's so much to the map, I thought it would be more linear
[2:53:27] <CommanderCOOL> oh its get sooo much better
[2:53:27] <+Punchasaur> The Star Wars of dark souls
[2:53:32] <HaikuRaichu> Are you playing on the hardest difficulty @angriestpat
[2:53:33] <%juxtest> Tomb of the Buddlefluppan Giants
[2:53:36] <%Alopekis> @King_Wolf_Rigger You do. But some of us prefer our dictators with a little less sack.
[2:53:43] <otakon17> just FORCE it open
[2:53:44] <+GingerStrawhat> Hows the Game so far Pat?
[2:53:46] <mankeyfigh> @haikuraichu he is
[2:53:47] <%SWFanatic> shits locked
[2:53:48] <ape_hawk> hes playing it on bitch mode
[2:53:51] <Dwarven_Gaming> if only you have a LIGHTSABER TO CUT IT
[2:53:55] <%Typhaeon> Apart from the one frog boss it really doesn't seem hard
[2:53:57] <+Blargimazombie> I mean it might be true, but he still was going to say that
[2:54:00] <samuelfisk> I couldn’t finish Force Unleashed because of a glitch on Felucia
[2:54:01] <pantherpiss2> they difficulty they call very normal
[2:54:03] <%SWFanatic> @Dwarven_Gaming i know...
[2:54:05] <butthurtdave> for second hardest, weird that one blaster deflect is an instakill on enemies
[2:54:08] <Tedious_Tickles> Respawns intended difficulty is usually the hardest difficulty
[2:54:11] <otakon17> on mooks
[2:54:13] <otakon17> theyr'e mooks
[2:54:14] <+yoshkosh20> its made out of that metal that lightsabers can't cut.
[2:54:14] <%miguelrod777> if only i had a super laser that can cut metal
[2:54:16] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @Alopekis I understand. It's an acquired taste.
[2:54:17] <otakon17> ofc they're gonna be easy
[2:54:19] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> why doesn't he just use the force to see in the dark?
[2:54:21] <Virokwet> wouldnt that be normal?
[2:54:29] <Psyramics> except everything around the door is rock
[2:54:30] <+starknight7> Pat are you still fat?
[2:54:30] <otakon17> they're only a danger in GREAT amounts
[2:54:30] <+Dayube> difficulty doesn't change enemy hp
[2:54:33] <%cureneckbeard> lightsabers can't cut through this door. it's umbaran steel
[2:54:37] <%GarbageQueenEllie> I had fun with the Force Unleashed games. But looking back on it, I haven't played either in ages... it's not the best by any means
[2:54:41] <+VektorTroika> @yoshkosh20 finally remembered that metal was called cortosis
[2:54:43] <%Tearonex> It's usally the second hardest
[2:54:46] <%pilgrimsayswhat> Pat that’s not Respawn apatWhat
[2:54:51] <beetbo2> The ginger metal
[2:55:01] <ChoculaUltra> I've seen some tweets saying this game is by default better than any Souls game because of it's selectable difficulties. Can't make this shit up.
[2:55:01] <ScreamLord> Copper and Bronze are good colors
[2:55:02] <Hellarussian> calladooty
[2:55:04] <%Typhaeon> Infinity Ward though
[2:55:05] <%RyanDD781> cortosis copper gotta keep it space themed
[2:55:06] <LixFury> I love that meaty fuckin ignition sound
[2:55:07] <otakon17> The gingerest of metal
[2:55:07] <KaiserMario> OH MY GOD RICH, ITS STAR WAAAAAARSSS
[2:55:08] <+yoshkosh20> @VektorTroika I was thinking it was cortisol, but that a chemical.
[2:55:10] <pantherpiss2> heroic was the intented for halo?
[2:55:12] <mor3gan> look up
[2:55:12] <%konekoryugamine> Oh MUCH better

[2:57:00] <ChoculaUltra> I find it weird they let you chop up the tiny non-combat critters. EA really trying to cap on that young serial killer audience.
[2:57:03] <%RyanDD781> Space Goat most deadly enemy
[2:57:07] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @GarbageQueenEllie it's space copper

[2:57:39] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @Sphincter_Spelunker You'd want to use cortosis or something similar for a hilt. So that other lightsabers can't break it

[2:59:35] <$spardanwarrior> Rawket Lawnchair
[2:59:36] <otakon17> I bet there is a Rocket Redirect Force ability later in the tree
[2:59:36] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Man, a boltgun would fuck a jedi's day up so bad.
[2:59:37] <+HellCopter> Gotta force push the rocket back of course

[2:59:45] <Manjove> if only you had some kind of push with the force
[2:59:46] <Rotabrutsama> stormtroopers dont even have dental
[2:59:46] <%konekoryugamine> OH! BD-1! BUDDY-1!

[3:00:16] <%Neo_Kaiser> If you compare the percentage of hits Stormtroopers had in the original trilogy compared to real life percentages they're actually way better.

[3:01:26] <Manjove> he got a good hit in tho
[3:01:27] <DisGuyOvahEre> most soldiers in real life are built to die
[3:01:28] <dekkitout> Better to be built to die than cloned to die
[3:01:32] <+joekuta71> We need a Tr*R in this game
[3:01:33] <%konekoryugamine> Okay that was kind of cool
[3:01:34] <%GarbageQueenEllie> I mean, all enemy npcs are built to die. What makes these so special?
[3:01:34] <%cureneckbeard> wheeee
[3:01:38] <%kujofire990> don't let up....they let up

[3:01:40] <%supersugoisenpai1> No, I must murder
[3:01:40] <%v1Ables> basic storm troopers are essentially military police

[3:01:59] <%Typhaeon> They never learned object permanence
[3:01:59] <Essixian> He got a good hit in though
[3:01:59] <+OkamiDude15> that dude got some good hits in
[3:02:00] <%Alopekis> In fairness, that's probably what they should do.
[3:02:00] <%RyanDD781> that fucking punch is so funny
[3:02:02] <+Adalore> I love that their punches are the most successful means of harming you.
[3:02:02] <%SWFanatic> baba doesn't like it

[3:02:16] <%honeyman18> I'd give up, what the hell I'm supposed to do?
[3:02:20] <FalseEyeD> Kill'em All 1977 I am jedi man
[3:02:26] <Tedious_Tickles> To be fair, they probably though you slid right off the cliff
[3:02:27] <NeroInfinite> for a second I thought he was using a storm tropper's body to get down the snow.
[3:02:27] <ChoculaUltra> this is the ai on the second hardest difficulty too.
[3:02:27] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> OSFrog woof
[3:02:30] <%RyanDD781> does he just call them all dogs
[3:02:31] <Tedious_Tickles> *thought
[3:02:31] <%realm_forge> Stormtroopers have always been shit it’s tradition.
[3:02:31] <Rotabrutsama> this game seems super easy
[3:02:36] <%RyanDD781> was the frog a dog
[3:02:43] <hunter4813> They made the dog stand there to make you feel cool. game design
[3:02:46] <+ATentacleMonster> are these stormtroopers okay
[3:02:47] <%SWFanatic> "I did some grinding offscreen and now I'm Yoda." -Pat 2019

[3:03:27] <NeroInfinite> The storm troopers witht he shock batons ar basically riot police
[3:03:28] <%Faustgesicht> HE shined so bright, he died instantly
[3:03:29] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @mugwugsampoo Second highest difficulty.
[3:03:31] <Pnutz409> any prediction on bf deal?
[3:03:32] <+joekuta71> SO wait he has Time Stop but not Force Push?
[3:03:37] <%razielhex> neffo de zeffo
[3:03:37] <Namillus> @deviljhojho_ Are we counting the military staff on the Death Star?

[3:03:41] <%NovaKnightmare> Good ole Sheev
[3:03:41] <ape_hawk> "my time to shine!" "killed in less than a second"
[3:03:43] <KaiserMario> @AngriestPat Is this better than The Last Jedi?
[3:03:44] <%konekoryugamine> THAT'S A HUGE SHIP
[3:03:49] <NeroInfinite> Their stuff was made to resist light sabers to a degree
[3:03:50] <Manjove> SCOMP
[3:03:54] <ChoculaUltra> this guy can force freeze shit but some how can't force jump?!
[3:03:55] <+Evergreen_45> now i am reminding that look has killed hundreds of thousands
[3:03:56] <+VektorTroika> Coruscant. The entire planet is like one big city.
[3:03:57] <%deviljhojho_> @Namillus @twistedj3ster he didnt see the light fade from their eyes... helmets....
[3:03:58] <%Havictos> @UmoLoco oh....well then so another game that treats a lightsaber like a glowing baseball bat?
[3:04:01] <+Evergreen_45> luke* lol
[3:04:04] <%JJCheeker> I mean he sent troops here
[3:04:05] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Everything is better than TLJ
[3:04:05] <+palebluedots> Not a high bar
[3:04:08] <+spacehouse> Palpations has a hospital
[3:04:08] <+Adalore> What sort of nonsense promotion system do they have that the "Last to survive" of a squad gets extra like points?
[3:04:09] <%NovaKnightmare> a warm turd is better than TLJ
[3:04:11] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Story makes sense, so it's automatically better than that movie.
[3:04:12] <Mister_McDerp> second sister is just a better kylo ren
[3:04:13] <Manjove> not a high bar at all
[3:04:13] <%xtremegamer80> That's pretty cool for a normie
[3:04:14] <%TDAWS_MP132> Ok, but that's a movie tho???
[3:04:16] <%Neo_Kaiser> Why what's wrong with The Last Jedi, do you hate women?
[3:04:17] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> Is it full of gambling for children?
[3:04:18] <%konekoryugamine> @AngriestPat Pretty sure someone's gonna tear your ass for that hot take
[3:04:20] <+TheBitingIrish> Aren't some jedi just not good at certain force abilities?
[3:04:26] <Manjove> no gambling
[3:04:27] <butthurtdave> at this point i'm convinced you can kill a stormtrooper just by sneezing on them
[3:04:27] <Ion_Laser> Star Wars games are always better than the films. Period
[3:04:28] <+Adalore> Bonfire detected
[3:04:30] <Cymen90> @tdaws_mp132 a bad movie
[3:04:33] <FunkyStreams> coool
[3:04:33] <Namillus> Talent with the Force varies by individual.
[3:04:34] <%NovaKnightmare> Pat, do you ever think about how Palpatine's first name is fucking Sheev?
[3:04:36] <%RyanDD781> last jedi banned for loot boxes
[3:04:36] <+TheBitingIrish> @Neo_Kaiser No, he hates shitty movies.
[3:04:39] <ChoculaUltra> but why don't the Storm Troopers get a broom to sweep away the Jedi floor magic
[3:04:42] <b1gboss007> low bar
[3:04:42] <Namillus> Cal has Stasis and Psychometry primarily.
[3:04:42] <+VektorTroika> @TDAWS_MP132 there's a movie of an old EU book?
[3:04:43] <Pnutz409> I hate echoes.
[3:04:46] <bsmusic> @konekoryugamine More like lukewarm take
[3:04:47] <+KingOfTheFist> This game seems very generous with the amount of bonfires
[3:04:48] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> @TheBitingIrish why don't they just use the force to get better at the force?
[3:04:48] <%JJCheeker> Hell attack of the clones is better than tlj
[3:04:51] <%Faustgesicht> this senseless property damage was a good thing
[3:04:58] <+TheBitingIrish> @ThatOneGuyYouSaw ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[3:05:00] <%Neo_Kaiser> That's a Red Letter Media reference...
[3:05:00] <+CrazyRainbows> better than TLJ is like bottom of the fucking barrel lmao
[3:05:11] <Manjove> they know they are jobbers
[3:05:15] <collind99> @jjcheeker that’s the dumbest fucking take dude
[3:05:17] <Essixian> These stormtroopers are really into deflecting blame, aren't they.
[3:05:18] <%xtremegamer80> MINIGUN
[3:05:24] <Hellarussian> how unfortunate
[3:05:25] <$HyperionXV> Hey it's the shield from battlefront
[3:05:25] <%Alopekis> It's a Battlefront 2 stormtrooper!
[3:05:27] <otakon17> he has a MINIGUN with a SHIELD
[3:05:29] <collind99> The Last Jedi is better than all of the prequels lmao
[3:05:29] <%This_is_Marco> Can we use Jedi mind tricks to make the stormtroopers quit their jobs?
[3:05:29] <%NovaKnightmare> Hey thats the thing from Battlefront 2
[3:05:30] <Mister_McDerp> I played as that guy in bf2!
[3:05:33] <+VektorTroika> @ThatOneGuyYouSaw You gotta use the mitochondria to use the force to get the force
[3:05:33] <+palebluedots> The praise that the enimies give is such bs
[3:05:37] <Manjove> no it isnt
[3:05:41] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> I think a real LMG would have more effect
[3:05:43] <nuane> this is on hard? pat looks like he's coasting through
[3:05:44] <%cerazor01> cerazor01 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months, currently on a 10 month streak! Jedi Academy Stream sometime?
[3:05:45] <%honeyman18> The implication is force abilities are just expressions of personal emotions, so some people can't feel it enough to use that ability. Takes a mindset
[3:05:47] <%RyanDD781> literally just tachanka
[3:05:51] <+ATentacleMonster> wow
[3:05:53] <%Alopekis> lol
[3:05:54] <DisGuyOvahEre> tfw the storm troopers respawn like its dark souls but dark souls had an actual in canon reason for why things respawned and somethings didn't
[3:05:56] <DashXero> I wish "It's a Jedi, you dumb bitch." was actual dialogue in this game.
[3:05:57] <mor3gan> Shield
[3:05:59] <%Alopekis> "Overheated, hold on."
[3:06:01] <otakon17> good thing you picked up improved guard
[3:06:01] <%Neo_Kaiser> In Jedi Academy you could put points into Jedi Mind Tricks that make the Stormtroopers forget you exist. and invisible in multiplayer.
[3:06:02] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @nuane Yeah, it's on the second hardest difficulty.
[3:06:02] <+ATentacleMonster> LOL
[3:06:03] <waifoong98> @nuane it varies, the hardest difficulty is pretty bullshit
[3:06:08] <%konekoryugamine> Either Pat is too good or this is too easy
[3:06:10] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> @VektorTroika why can't non-force sensitives just use the force to become force sensitive?
[3:06:13] <dukenux> me? :)
[3:06:16] <+palebluedots> This is a joke
[3:06:22] <+darkgareth01> BATTLE BREAKEEEERS@
[3:06:27] <trianglehat> how far is this in the game?
[3:06:27] <+darkgareth01> WOOO
[3:06:31] <dekkitout> @ThatOneGuyYouSaw I think Savage Oppress essentially did that
[3:06:35] <+VektorTroika> @ThatOneGuyYouSaw cuz their mitochondria don't wanna
[3:06:35] <DisGuyOvahEre> @ThatOneGuyYouSaw cause non force sensitives cant use the force
[3:06:36] <pth88> these guys are so fucking casual about being 2 seconds away from getting chopped in half
[3:06:43] <AzirothTheGreat> if you parry them all then yes
[3:06:43] <+Arsimckhoi> What is this ? The Witcher : The force awakens?
[3:06:44] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @ThatOneGuyYouSaw That's not how the Force works.
[3:06:44] <Tedious_Tickles> only the second planet since he started
[3:06:44] <%king_wragles> !playtime
[3:06:47] <hunter4813> They would probably be way more effective with any sense of their surroundings in anyway whatsoever
[3:06:47] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Hes 40 hours in
[3:06:48] <subjectg> saying shit like “i’ll break your guard” is too much, it’s like saying “i will deplete your health points, scum”
[3:06:49] <%king_wragles> !uptime
[3:06:49] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 6m.
[3:06:51] <%Anime_Flux> If this is medium hard, how easy is Easy? Like, do the troopers just stand around and not shoot at all?
[3:06:54] <+darkgareth01> is this game good guys?
[3:06:55] <dekkitout> He hated his way into using the force- with help from magic, nevermind...
[3:06:57] <%konekoryugamine> Poor doggie behind me is reverse sneezing
[3:06:57] <VJdarkworld> @pth88 storm troopers in a nutshell
[3:06:59] <gonzy92> you can
[3:06:59] <trianglehat> ah
[3:07:03] <+TheBitingIrish> Stupid lazy mitochondria...
[3:07:14] <%qazwsxedc168> wait hes how far into the game?
[3:07:14] <+ATentacleMonster> really
[3:07:15] <otakon17> MIDICHLORIANS
[3:07:17] <%Alopekis> @darkgareth01 So far, yes. :D
[3:07:18] <%SWFanatic> men only want one thing and its disgusting: lightsaber sleeves
[3:07:22] <+TheBitingIrish> @konekoryugamine My dog does that, it's awful :(
[3:07:23] <%Neo_Kaiser> Midiclorians is the mitochondria of the soul.
[3:07:28] <+VektorTroika> @otakon17 are the powerhouse of the force cell
[3:07:28] <otakon17> Mitochrondia set you on fire or turn you to goo
[3:07:30] <%deviljhojho_> game looks nice so far
[3:07:32] <%konekoryugamine> @TheBitingIrish it sounds painful as hell
[3:07:33] <FunkyStreams> Can you upgrade you jedi ice abilities?
[3:07:34] <%RyanDD781> you mean ice pat?
[3:07:37] <+CptnCampy61> Oh it’s the Disneyland pieces for the saber
[3:07:42] <%deviljhojho_> pfffft
[3:07:42] <%konekoryugamine> You know that ice is going to hit a hazard sooner or later
[3:07:43] <otakon17> can you slow the rocket?
[3:07:44] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @konekoryugamine From what I've heard, the one difficulty higher than this, is dummy hard and a little BS, so it's kinda weird. I think Pat is just really good and we usually never take that into consideration.
[3:07:44] <%deviljhojho_> nice aim
[3:07:46] <%konekoryugamine> WATCH ME BE RIGHT
[3:07:46] <sonicblade38> so when does a giant hawk drop the pursuer on him
[3:07:54] <otakon17> bc they're animals
[3:07:58] <%deviljhojho_> animals are dumb
[3:07:58] <Mechazoic_Era> bc blubber
[3:07:58] <robwob2016> Cuz they Chonky
[3:07:58] <lyzejag> deep
[3:07:59] <otakon17> have you SEEN a bear?
[3:07:59] <%MagickBurritoh> more fat
[3:08:01] <Essixian> Thiccer body
[3:08:01] <+Adalore> because they are melee.
[3:08:02] <%konekoryugamine> @King_Wolf_Rigger Figured it was the latter
[3:08:03] <DashXero> Because Stormtroopers are bitches.
[3:08:04] <+Dayube> @konekoryugamine *honking intensifies in the background*
[3:08:05] <Mister_McDerp> humans are squishy
[3:08:05] <otakon17> Bears can tank WAY more than a human can
[3:08:05] <mostundesired> Dude, animals are minmaxed to survive.
[3:08:06] <Tedious_Tickles> well, animals are more durable than humans in real life
[3:08:07] <%Havictos> @AngriestPat Does the fact that you can't lightsaber people to pieces affect your opinion if the game so far?
[3:08:07] <Cool_Guy45> bears are alot strong than people pat
[3:08:07] <bsmusic> Because they're stormtroopers
[3:08:09] <Avoxis> That felt more like Jak and Daxter than uncharted to me
[3:08:09] <Gorgen> Where is Jar Jar? Is he okay?
[3:08:09] <%deviljhojho_> Jotaz
[3:08:09] <%Maids4lyfe> so how's Star Souls Pat?

[3:08:20] <Madax_Rixala> Have you ever fought a Moose Pat?
[3:08:20] <Bigbossman91> @AngriestPat Because humans are weak
[3:08:20] <subjectg> @king_wolf_rigger it could be like how heroic and legendary in halo have massive differences too
[3:08:21] <ScreamLord> Because Storm Trooper is literally made out of plastic
[3:08:21] <+JavaManJoJo> why is the lightsaber only lighting up infront of you?
[3:08:22] <%konekoryugamine> YOUSA OK BOOGIE
[3:08:22] <+VektorTroika> @Gorgen it seems that in your anger...you killed him

[3:08:37] <FunkyStreams> @AngriestPat I dont think the Empire spends too much currency on each Stormtrooper. whereas nature has spent millenia perfecting those animals to survive.
[3:08:38] <%honeyman18> Storm trooper armor is shit, basically paper

[3:09:07] <dekkitout> Force, I ain't gotta explain shit
[3:09:07] <Gorgen> Nanomachines pat
[3:09:07] <%Alopekis> Because you're focusing the light in one direction with the Force
[3:09:08] <%AncelDeLambert> this game cribs HARD off of so many games and it's kinda blatant when it does
[3:09:08] <%konekoryugamine> "In accordance with the Emperor's will"
[3:09:09] <Tedious_Tickles> Same reason why a torch in Bloodborne would do the same
[3:09:10] <bsmusic> because cool
[3:09:10] <FrostyStreamTV> maybe it has a flashlight setting
[3:09:12] <$shurtal> extra button for flexing the lazer sword?

[3:13:41] <%realm_forge> YOU WERE THE CHOSEN ONE
[3:13:44] <%cureneckbeard> this is how Order 66 was so successful. The Jedi suck
[3:13:45] <+Punchasaur> Snek
[3:13:50] <CrypticMochi> Get these guys armor upgrades
[3:13:52] <%AncelDeLambert> this combat is way too Shadow of Mordor

[3:13:59] <%NovaKnightmare> I legit feel bad for these guys
[3:14:00] <astrophizz> chain paries
[3:14:00] <+dante_must_die_exe> Wouldn't they stop shooting after they see the first perfect deflection?
[3:14:05] <%supersugoisenpai1> These guys seem way too confident
[3:14:08] <%konekoryugamine> CLIFF
[3:14:10] <Dakuu75> they don't give you force-push yet... because you'd jsut fling um all off the cliff and be done in half-a-second
[3:14:12] <otakon17> okay that Stormtrooper SHOT through him
[3:14:13] <+dante_must_die_exe> Or is their clone brain have the big dumb
[3:14:14] <otakon17> that was bullshit
[3:14:14] <FunkyStreams> combat in this reminds me a lot of the Mordor games.
[3:14:16] <+Jaysky> Imagine being a stormtrooper and you manage to knock a jedi off a cliff only for him to teleport back infront of you and then kill him again
[3:14:18] <Dakuu75> I assume you get it later
[3:14:22] <+chocothunder_> that trooper called that assist 1
[3:14:22] <ChoculaUltra> what the hell triggers that full heal on hit? that seems kind've busted.
[3:14:24] <+CptnCampy61> This is the best enemy chatter ever

[3:14:30] <%This_is_Marco> I-I hit him.. now what??
[3:14:32] <%AncelDeLambert> it's really weird that the force power you start with is TIME DILATION

[3:14:33] <VJdarkworld> @Jaysky FeelsBadMan
[3:14:33] <+Grizzytron> @Dakuu75 They're adapting the tried-and-true methodology of trialing the minority as an adult

[3:16:28] <Tedious_Tickles> this is what DS2's lighting was gonna be like before they downgraded everything for console plebs
[3:16:29] <+CrazyRainbows> I LOVE that this game lets you use the saber as your flashlight. Because of course a jedi would just whip it out to see in the dark.
[3:16:29] <swagemite282> can you choose your lightsaber color? if so which colors are available?

[3:16:50] <aracon_> soon you can push storm troopers into bottomless pits
[3:16:50] <ChoculaUltra> what Star Wars game perfectly captures the light saber/force power fantasy? Cuz watching these rats tank multiple hits makes me feel some type of way
[3:16:50] <%Keyd00d> the force

[3:16:52] <%DSD24> @swagemite282 I think Blue Green and Yellow that's all I know so far
[3:16:53] <+Pigg1yJuffs> So is the general consensus about this game that it's a good and Respawn did a good and saved EA's Star Wars license? @angriestpat

[3:17:12] <DisGuyOvahEre> tfw he gets time stop when force speed and force push are the first two spells you get. TFW SKYRIM got forcepowers right more than this game
[3:17:21] <otakon17> @ChoculaUltra Force Unleashed and the Jedi Academy games come to mind if you don't mind going older
[3:17:24] <+palebluedots> Did an average
[3:17:25] <bleugh> we did a good
[3:17:25] <%Keyd00d> look we did a good now let us run the license into the ground once more

[3:18:43] <%Havictos> @ChoculaUltra The Jedi outcast games especially 2. You put in a mod the re enables violence and you can chop people up in one lightsaber hit.
[3:18:43] <%SWFanatic> "Who needs fucking?" -Pat 2019
[3:18:45] <mostundesired> Goats to stronk
[3:18:45] <sonicblade38> @AngriestPat imagine if the goats has a sword like sif the game would be unbeatable
[3:18:46] <+dante_must_die_exe> Goat Gang! Goat Gang!
[3:18:47] <%Keyd00d> Goats are the natural enemy of the Jedi
[3:18:51] <%realm_forge> Goats always have the high ground
[3:18:51] <%NovaKnightmare> OI think those are the asshole goats on Dantooine from KOTOR 1
[3:18:56] <IminyourBase> @AngriestPat militarized space animals is a terrifying concept
[3:18:58] <+TheBitingIrish> This dude has no hops
[3:18:58] <%Alopekis> You can't yet
[3:18:59] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Also goats are tough and chewy
[3:19:00] <otakon17> oh I remember those asshole goats
[3:19:01] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> thicc goat must die
[3:19:04] <rockmansrb2> Super Goat
[3:19:05] <otakon17> I hated those goats
[3:19:06] <%Finakala> Most animals in games are stronger than regular humans
[3:19:07] <dekkitout> If the goats are this capable, imagine the geese monkaS
[3:19:09] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @NovaKnightmare Kath Hounds?
[3:19:10] <+VektorTroika> @King_Wolf_Rigger ah, but wouldn't that also make them like paladins?
[3:19:15] <%goose_attack_almanac> Zoids
[3:19:15] <+Jaysky> @IminyourBase So the krogan? Kappa
[3:19:17] <%Laecerelius> If only this lamer knew how to Force Jump
[3:19:19] <mankeyfigh> @angriestpat You get skill points “snaps” like that
[3:19:20] <Dakuu75> I love it when a jedi or sith is so strong. the force is basically a symbiote suit
[3:19:25] <%honeyman18> You gotta roast them and simmer them in sauce. Make Carnittas
[3:19:25] <DisGuyOvahEre> bounty hunters use dogs that can smell the force so its already a thing
[3:19:27] <%NovaKnightmare> @GarbageQueenEllie on second look, probably not, but close
[3:19:29] <otakon17> BAD space goat
[3:19:30] <uncledoodsauce> sidious should have made a clone army of goats instead
[3:19:31] <%a_lucky_soul> isn't that the plot of aliens
[3:19:33] <IminyourBase> @Jaysky lol pretty much
[3:19:40] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat did you scan the goats?
[3:19:42] <Essixian> INFINITE GOAT RUSH
[3:19:45] <trianglehat> from the goat closet
[3:19:46] <+earthboy2k> the goat dimension
[3:19:47] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @VektorTroika That means Sith really are Dark Knights
[3:19:51] <+Punchasaur> GORT
[3:19:54] <%This_is_Marco> Like those armored boars in DS
[3:19:56] <+CrazyRainbows> where's the boss goat
[3:19:57] <StuffNFluff> Did he just parry a goat
[3:19:59] <medjoe> Force goat uses MULTIPLY
[3:20:00] <otakon17> Goat DEFEATED
[3:20:00] <%vaporousTippler> I like to think every one of these goats are voiced by Adam Sandler.
[3:20:02] <+Pigg1yJuffs> So how does this game feel, I keep hearing it feels like a Souls game but it looks like it handles like an Uncharted games. @angriestpat
[3:20:02] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> I mean, that one hologram was just saying how they were being killed by the fauna.
[3:20:04] <AzirothTheGreat> War Elephants. but goats
[3:20:05] <ScreamLord> Sure wish there was a Lightsaber bench nearby so we can look at all these parts he's collecting
[3:20:07] <%Anime_Flux> harvest them to make a goatsaber
[3:20:09] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @VektorTroika Sure. But Paladins are just Clerics with less Jesus juice, and more Fighter salt lol.
[3:20:09] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @AngriestPat Wow, No More Heroes 3 looks funky
[3:20:09] <%Finakala> Nothing as satisfying in Sekiro as parrying dogs
[3:20:10] <Mister_McDerp> the empire was working on an infinite goat superweapon
[3:20:17] <otakon17> anger goats are around
[3:20:22] <Mister_McDerp> it got out of control
[3:20:25] <Essixian> @AngriestPat Are the goats the Black Knights or Silver Knights of this game?
[3:20:29] <%SWFanatic> the goat has the high ground
[3:20:30] <uncledoodsauce> pretty sure these goats are no match for goat simulator goat though
[3:20:31] <%SWFanatic> don't try it
[3:20:31] <+CrazyRainbows> You mean it goat out of control
[3:20:34] <+Punchasaur> Capra demons
[3:20:35] <%GarbageQueenEllie> "These things are pretty cute" (STAB)

[3:22:17] <FunkyStreams> I hate goats. They're coarse, and they get everywhere.
[3:22:18] <%Keyd00d> Is this the Dark Souls of Star Wars games? Someone's probably already said that right
[3:22:18] <grayjammer> I cant see anything
[3:22:18] <mankeyfigh> ITS NO USE
[3:22:18] <otakon17> The Goat is the final boss

[3:24:02] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @VektorTroika Sure, but now you're thinking too literally about martial prowess. I play all my clerics as front line fighters. I set most of my spells to be something other than healing too.

[3:45:01] <Tedious_Tickles> nice transition
[3:45:03] <KeiPrime> cal looks like a dumb kid let him get hit in the face

[3:45:14] <reonome> YER A JEDI PAT
[3:45:14] <otakon17> AND THE BOUNCY EXPLODEY BALLS
[3:45:16] <%GraceTBM> I think it's really important that slow was your first power so that you're really looking forward to force push by the time you get it
[3:45:16] <%Laecerelius> EAt shit, child!
[3:45:17] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @ape_hawk Knuckles
[3:45:17] <TwinBat> BASED STAND

[3:45:31] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 45m.
[3:45:31] <DisGuyOvahEre> how did he forget how to PUSH???
[3:45:33] <Dr_Mooose> he did it
[3:45:33] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Looks like you're just breaking your obstacles to me
[3:45:33] <+justianxix> If you can dodge a wretch...
[3:45:36] <%ImmaCanuck> USE DA FORKS

[3:45:40] <Dakuu75> push it to the limit
[3:45:42] <majindusto> STEEL BALL TO THE GUT
[3:45:44] <nuane> this dude has the dumbest amnesia
[3:45:44] <+palebluedots> Why didn't he just force push from the beginning?
[3:45:44] <ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Walls are doors if you're MAGIC
[3:45:46] <crimsonsaens> Why didn't he do that sooner
[3:45:48] <%SWFanatic> I finally remembered how to PUSH after 3 hrs of slaughtering innocent animals and stormtroopers!
[3:45:49] <trianglehat> amazing bark
[3:45:49] <subjectg> walk along the razor’s edge
[3:45:52] <$Haughtymoss> Game doesn't start with force push? 0/10 IGN

[3:46:09] <%Laecerelius> OFF TO PLANET WE KNOW!
[3:46:10] <+CrazyRainbows> YEAAAAAAH
[3:46:11] <ape_hawk> called it

[3:46:11] <otakon17> OH SHIT
[3:46:11] <%razielhex> @otakon17 You mean to prime Trandoshan hunting grounds
[3:46:12] <robwob2016> YOOOOOOO

[3:46:12] <subjectg> Are we going to find the Star Map there?
[3:46:14] <ZE_Count> Time for big trees!
[3:46:14] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @SWFanatic Those animals had it coming. They knew what they did.
[3:46:19] <%AncelDeLambert> LUL
[3:46:20] <robwob2016> YODA'S WOOKIE PAL
[3:46:20] <%Anime_Flux> oh hey again

[3:46:22] <trianglehat> oh yea
[3:46:23] <majindusto> Oh No...WOOKIES
[3:46:24] <%LiquidShake83> vex?
[3:46:29] <Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> wouldn't kashykk be under the empire's yolk at this point?
[3:46:29] <+CrazyRainbows> Let's go on Life Day though!
[3:46:30] <rcand9> but what about the droid attack on the wookies
[3:46:35] <+palebluedots> Atleast in metroid other m there was a reason why samus couldn't use her weapons
[3:46:36] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> did he forget that he already knew how to force push?
[3:46:36] <ape_hawk> YOU HAVE TO UNPLUG HIM TO STUN HIM!
[3:46:38] <DisGuyOvahEre> tarful is the wookie chieftain in episode 3
[3:46:40] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> no sackbeating
[3:46:40] <FunkyStreams> Impressive!
[3:46:40] <+Punchasaur> ITCHY AND STINKY
[3:46:46] <otakon17> ofc you need FORCE to do it
[3:46:47] <%joylent_blue> don't fucking spoil mechanics, nerds
[3:46:49] <@StridentSong> Don't backseat.
[3:46:50] <prophetdisharmonious> I need healing!
[3:46:53] <Dr_Mooose> foot
[3:46:54] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat gotta read
[3:46:55] <otakon17> you really need a passive force regen in this
[3:47:04] <ElemeNtxt> dis game is so boring
[3:47:05] <%AncelDeLambert> chargin up his LASAH
[3:47:13] <Pnutz409> carve for parts
[3:47:15] <%MelBrooksKA> @StridentSong can I front seat?
[3:47:16] <Dakuu75> gotta say. your dodge-roll being a back-flippy-dippy... pretty cool
[3:47:17] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @otakon17 Every other Star Wars game has one
[3:47:19] <teamjflight> LETS GO
[3:47:20] <%joylent_blue> ElemeNtxt ur boring
[3:47:21] <MoulesFritz> your shirt is fucking dumb
[3:47:21] <+trustycoyote> @AngriestPat Can the force push help you get the shiny thing back there or did it need some lever or something?
[3:47:28] <prophetdisharmonious> if you can't rip out a human heart with the force don't talk to me about mechanics Kappa
[3:47:30] <MoulesFritz> nice poncho nerd
[3:47:35] <Tatrix912> Someone needs to mod it with Alex Jones
[3:47:46] <OToole42> @ElemeNtxt no one is forcing you to stay bub
[3:47:51] <otakon17> @GarbageQueenEllie yeah they seem to have made it either a skill tree/plot progression unlock or made it so it's not passive to force you to atack enemie sand not play keep away with force powers
[3:47:56] <+Pharmakokinetic> so aside from the obvious Souls comparison does this game seem dope on its own merits cause it looks pretty cool for the most part
[3:47:57] <crimsonsaens> Is this just jedi Dark Souls>
[3:48:00] <dekkitout> Wait, he went into a giant circular room and didn't fight a boss? Or was I away for 1 second too long
[3:48:09] <+palebluedots> This game just takes a bunch of elements from other games and shoves them together and adds nothing new. Pure boring safety.
[3:48:09] <otakon17> he fought a Tomb Guardian
[3:48:19] <otakon17> kind of a miniboss mook
[3:48:26] <%AncelDeLambert> @palebluedots sadly true
[3:48:27] <Gorgen> Your droid is such a potty mouth jermaDisgust
[3:48:27] <Ion_Laser> @crimsonsaens pretty much along with sekiro
[3:48:28] <%animalxer> shortcut
[3:48:35] <%AncelDeLambert> and the writing is pretty mediocre, too
[3:48:40] <nuane> Tomb Raider Dark Souls with a Star Wars paint job
[3:48:40] <+CrazyRainbows> I love BD-1 so much, he's cute
[3:48:42] <%JJCheeker> the midichlorians in the water are turning the frogs gay
[3:48:44] <%NovaKnightmare> a whole bitch
[3:48:47] <%MelBrooksKA> It's a front baby bitch room
[3:48:47] <Monkeyweed21> BLIND
[3:48:52] <%Capta1n_H3nry> Metroidvania?!
[3:48:54] <AzirothTheGreat> go back to scrungus
[3:48:54] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> You're a side baby bitch room
[3:48:56] <rcand9> right pat I'm leaving i wanna play the game now bye bye
[3:48:58] <CybertronPrime> @palebluedots I mean, is there something wrong with that?
[3:48:59] <Monkeyweed21> BIG BLIND
[3:49:05] <otakon17> SAVE POINT
[3:49:09] <%bevyrage> what?
[3:49:09] <CybertronPrime> Not every game has to inovate.
[3:49:13] <Dakuu75> @AncelDeLambert what, you don't like examining a kitchen and getting the dialogue "ppl use to store food here."
[3:49:13] <ape_hawk> that is too many y's
[3:49:14] <%joylent_blue> Pharmakokinetic its a bit of everything kinda, its got puzzles and spectacle platforming along with the combat
[3:49:14] <%razielhex> original tomb rtoom
[3:49:14] <FunkyStreams> kashyeeet
[3:49:16] <%AncelDeLambert> @CybertronPrime there's nothing RIGHT about it
[3:49:18] <+palebluedots> @CybertronPrime It's boring
[3:49:21] <Monkeyweed21> YOU HAVE A MAP CUMBO
[3:49:24] <%AncelDeLambert> @Dakuu75 LUL
[3:49:30] <%seaearthandsky> @palebluedots not every game has to reinvent the wheel. Is the game fantastic? no. does it look like good dumb fun? yes.
[3:49:30] <%Capta1n_H3nry> IM GONNA COOOOOOOM
[3:49:31] <majindusto> YOU ARE ZE STUPID
[3:49:37] <teamjflight> wait I'm confused Kashyyk is a planet
[3:49:43] <%MelBrooksKA> Have we unlocked easy mode yet?
[3:49:44] <teamjflight> right?
[3:49:46] <crimsonsaens> Get Time Stop
[3:49:46] <mankeyfigh> OH
[3:49:46] <+Punchasaur> You just unlocked a planet by going into a room
[3:49:47] <teamjflight> chat?
[3:49:49] <%Laecerelius> Big Khimari push
[3:49:53] <+joekuta71> Mass push seems real good
[3:49:54] <otakon17> AUTO BLOCK WHEN SPRINTING
[3:50:00] <%LiquidShake83> agile
[3:50:00] <%joylent_blue> teamjflight yeah
[3:50:00] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Is there an ability to make you better at combat
[3:50:02] <Aji__> @teamjflight yeah wookie planet
[3:50:04] <%WackyGear> push
[3:50:08] <%AncelDeLambert> wait, they put a Ninja Run in this game?
[3:50:10] <FunkyStreams> Do the one that gives you the high ground.
[3:50:11] <subjectg> where’s my death field respawn
[3:50:11] <+CrazyRainbows> It is, Pat just unlocked being able to go there I think
[3:50:12] <dekkitout> Moar forss
[3:50:12] <%SWFanatic> Use the Force Pat
[3:50:13] <+palebluedots> @seaearthandsky Then what is the point of playing it? They could atleast try to add something new.
[3:50:14] <%GarbageQueenEllie> dash dash dash
[3:50:16] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Overwhelming Force
[3:50:16] <+TheBitingIrish> Auto block should probably come first
[3:50:19] <Hellarussian> never delay the thrust
[3:50:22] <theKingRamses> force recovery is pretty good
[3:50:28] <%AncelDeLambert> Raiden, use ze ninja run!
[3:50:29] <skeletonknifefight> whats the point of any video game?
[3:50:30] <skeletonknifefight> entertainment
[3:50:31] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> @CybertronPrime true, but having too many copycats gets old aftera while
[3:50:31] <Dakuu75> improve dash sounds like the way to go but, you-do-you brother~
[3:50:32] <teamjflight> @Aji__ @joylent_blue ok cause they called it an area and I thought I was dumb
[3:50:38] <majindusto> FORCE THRUST
[3:50:39] <bendatron> i would have gone straight to stims
[3:50:40] <otakon17> Let's WHOOP HIS ASS
[3:50:42] <CybertronPrime> @palebluedots ...To have fun? That's the point of every video game.
[3:50:49] <butthurtdave> can you push the ball down the ramp and crush him
[3:50:50] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Become strong.Become, forceful.
[3:50:51] <%Finakala> You know what was a fun game? Darksiders. And that game did very, VERY little new
[3:50:53] <Hellarussian> Black Manta?
[3:50:55] <%bevyrage> RESPECT WALK
[3:51:00] <%razielhex> theren it is
[3:51:01] <Ion_Laser> PogChamp
[3:51:03] <otakon17> THERE you finally got the cool kill
[3:51:03] <dekkitout> Neat
[3:51:04] <+ATentacleMonster> D:
[3:51:06] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> does that robot have a skirt?
[3:51:07] <nuane> you did the cool thing
[3:51:11] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> YO! Fuckin noice!
[3:51:11] <%AncelDeLambert> WOW the window on blasting its core out was long
[3:51:12] <zipfile777> gooder
[3:51:12] <+VektorTroika> @King_Wolf_Rigger this setting is a treasure trove. thanks man!
[3:51:13] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Did you do a cool? I was looking away
[3:51:13] <teamjflight> EPIC
[3:51:14] <%MelBrooksKA> Thank god for time stop
[3:51:24] <%Anime_Flux> That hint just cost you 5 MAGIC RINGS, Pat
[3:51:24] <%razielhex> ROCKET LEAGUE
[3:51:24] <Dakuu75> now it's a force-party
[3:51:34] <Ion_Laser> More Force is always a good idea in a Star Wars game
[3:51:37] <%joylent_blue> yeah there go your save items
[3:51:39] <+VektorTroika> now we sonic 06
[3:51:40] <%AncelDeLambert> oh god, physics puzzles
[3:51:40] <+TheBitingIrish> Me name am Pat, me have muich gooder talky skills
[3:51:45] <+palebluedots> @CybertronPrime To have fun is the point of almost every video game. If your video game adds nothing new then why make it?
[3:51:45] <dekkitout> Jedi-sports must've been rad in the Republic days
[3:51:46] <mankeyfigh> @angriestpat This upgrade made this enemy type laughably easy
[3:51:48] <teamjflight> rocket league 2 LEAKED?
[3:51:49] <%GarbageQueenEllie> At least there's that
[3:51:51] <Hellarussian> uh oh
[3:51:53] <%seaearthandsky> @palebluedots the same could be said of most beat em ups. that doesn't stop people from enjoying it. If you need new the things to be able to enjoy them because you get tired of the old I get that, but theres nothing wrong with taking old things and reusing or combing them.
[3:51:53] <otakon17> PHYSICS PHYSICS PHYSCIS
[3:51:55] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @VektorTroika No prob bud. I'm glad you like.
[3:51:57] <%bevyrage> how long until we get IT'S NO USE!
[3:51:58] <+Punchasaur> Look at this botw shrine
[3:52:06] <trianglehat> hold on
[3:52:08] <+CrazyRainbows> flip the map pat
[3:52:13] <otakon17> Okay
[3:52:13] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Sonic 06 Silver's Telekenesis ball puzzles..... same energy, just way more polish
[3:52:18] <Hellarussian> here we go
[3:52:24] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Is this like a Jedi pinball machine?
[3:52:24] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> It's no use. Take this.
[3:52:25] <%SWFanatic> Baba doesn't like it
[3:52:26] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> @AngriestPat use force pull
[3:52:28] <CybertronPrime> @palebluedots To... have... fun? I don't understand your point.
[3:52:34] <%AncelDeLambert> nothing worse than struggling with the physics engine
[3:52:34] <+palebluedots> @seaearthandsky It's fine if they reuse old game mechanics, but they can add something new.
[3:52:40] <%JJCheeker> If I made a video game I would have it insult the player for asking for a hint
[3:52:44] <%AncelDeLambert> LUL
[3:52:47] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> oh wait, nevermind
[3:52:48] <majindusto> Push, Push, push, SPHERES!!!
[3:53:03] <%Finakala> That was a counterweight you were looking at I think
[3:53:03] <MoulesFritz> thats.... where you came from
[3:53:03] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Must we become as Elton John?
[3:53:04] <+VektorTroika> @Bane_Kaikyo exactly, thank goodness
[3:53:05] <dekkitout> There's too many moving parts, I'm tappin out
[3:53:08] <Admiral_PopnFresh> This is just a Breath of the Wild shrine
[3:53:10] <Hellarussian> what a big hero
[3:53:13] <Dakuu75> look at this ancient pinball-temple
[3:53:15] <mankeyfigh> Puzzle time
[3:53:26] <otakon17> ah , second ball acquired
[3:53:31] <%Finakala> I love how Breath of the Wild just copied Tomb Raider
[3:53:34] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> The Who, whatever.
[3:53:36] <+valkuma> Pat finally has 2 balls.
[3:53:38] <trianglehat> one ball is lower
[3:53:40] <majindusto> TWO BALLS
[3:53:40] <butthurtdave> Pats got blue balls
[3:53:41] <ape_hawk> now he has two blue balls
[3:53:44] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> play with your balls
[3:53:46] <artoflec> @palebluedots i think a lot of the time the something new can take away from just fundamentally doing mechanics well.
[3:53:48] <%seaearthandsky> @palebluedots well, if thats how you feel then this game isn't for you, but that doesn't mean that pat or others shouldn't be allowed to enjoy it or have their fun.
[3:53:48] <%Bt_Robot> Multiball!
[3:53:52] <subjectg> it’s a good thing ancient jedi tombs were designed to have all this climbable geometry
[3:53:53] <%joylent_blue> pat's 2nd ball finally dropped
[3:53:53] <shiny_prinny> narrowly avoided saying two balls - ah nvm
[3:53:53] <iosephe> the balls touched!
[3:53:55] <Ion_Laser> BALLS OF STEEL
[3:53:55] <+twohitgood> go back to the skungus ?
[3:53:58] <%ShichiNoBushi> I've got two balls. I've got two balls.
[3:53:59] <%AncelDeLambert> I'd kill for a Dead Space telekinesis unit right now
[3:54:00] <%MelBrooksKA> Pat can finally shlorp his balls
[3:54:00] <Tedious_Tickles> rub the balls together
[3:54:03] <Hellarussian> wee
[3:54:03] <%Bane_Kaikyo> It's funnt cause T E S T I C L E S
[3:54:04] <FunkyStreams> I dont see how there's anything vaguely sexual about that remark.
[3:54:04] <+KingOfTheFist> Oh my god those are the literal exact hamster balls from Mortal Kombat Annihilation
[3:54:06] <%honeyman18> And they're blue
[3:54:06] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> yeet
[3:54:07] <%JJCheeker> danK
[3:54:07] <%Finakala> I'd kill for a new Dead Space that isn't 3
[3:54:12] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> big juice
[3:54:13] <teamjflight> 2 balls... one bigger than the other...
[3:54:13] <majindusto> THREE WOULD BE TOO MUCH
[3:54:17] <SchroedingersFerret> I don't get why people are saying this game has nothing new. The novelty is that it is Star Wars content that is actually good.
[3:54:17] <Holycow8498> The skungus
[3:54:22] <+Punchasaur> A ball and person moving at the same time?? 2 much 4 me!
[3:54:27] <%AncelDeLambert> nah, let Dead Space stay dead
[3:54:28] <otakon17> okay this is a multi tier puzzled
[3:54:31] <+VektorTroika> "A brass-bollocked bourgeoisie boiler!"
[3:54:31] <+palebluedots> @CybertronPrime The point it is boring and adds nothing new. Generally when making something new you add something new. Just shoving together old game mechanics just shows creative laziness.
[3:54:33] <%AncelDeLambert> EA can only make it worse
[3:54:39] <trianglehat> blue ball machine
[3:54:40] <%RobotPancake> @palebluedots something new like what? being a jedi has had most of the same rules for decades. Some of the later abilities are "new".
[3:54:45] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> what if you had a put put game, but you used force push?
[3:54:49] <nuane> what a puzzle, push ball into hole
[3:54:49] <crimsonsaens> Does Star Wars make Pat talk like Jar-jar?
[3:54:49] <dekkitout> To clarify, I meant my brain tapping out from whatever space wizard puzzle that was
[3:54:57] <DisGuyOvahEre> push the other one
[3:55:00] <TwinBat> big brain pat
[3:55:03] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Yup, become as The Who, and Pinball Wizard this game.
[3:55:04] <otakon17> he can't
[3:55:07] <ItsAGundamu> !uptime
[3:55:07] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 55m.
[3:55:10] <Hellarussian> how can it be
[3:55:10] <otakon17> he needs it to stay there
[3:55:10] <skeletonknifefight> if you cant enjoy a game that doesnt add a new thing never seen before in gaming that sounds like a legit bummer
[3:55:12] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Bork Bork Bork
[3:55:15] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> but how
[3:55:16] <Dakuu75> do you need a third ball?
[3:55:18] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> can this be
[3:55:18] <APsaull> how can this be?
[3:55:19] <CommanderCOOL> there another ball...
[3:55:22] <Rotwik> if only there was a third ball around...
[3:55:25] <Chumblago13> have boss fights been cool?
[3:55:27] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> It's impossible.
[3:55:30] <collind99> ANOTHER BALL
[3:55:33] <Tedious_Tickles> the new Doom games barely innovate at all but they are still good games
[3:55:33] <collind99> NO
[3:55:37] <CybertronPrime> @palebluedots If it's not broke, don't fix it. Whether it's boring or not is entirely subjective.
[3:55:37] <Hellarussian> always 2 balls
[3:55:40] <%MelBrooksKA> If only time stop
[3:55:41] <artoflec> I guarantee you palebluedots the games you've enjoyed in the past decade have all done things that were done before LULW
[3:55:42] <%AncelDeLambert> no wind
[3:55:42] <TwinBat> nope
[3:55:43] <%aslfrasle> Spheres and blocks, pushing. thinking and cubes, and think, think, think.
[3:55:43] <theKingRamses> air go down tho
[3:55:46] <%GarbageQueenEllie> 3
[3:55:50] <+trustycoyote> They even put a concave relief next to the hole to help keep the ball from falling off. Nice touch!
[3:55:53] <collind99> There are 3 balls pat
[3:55:54] <%AncelDeLambert> WEEE
[3:55:55] <+palebluedots> @RobotPancake An element that would be unique to the game. Even something small would atleast give it a reason to exist.
[3:56:04] <Delenay> the ball is stuck
[3:56:06] <FunkyStreams> Use your big shinny brain, Pat.
[3:56:10] <%JJCheeker> There's always a bigger ball
[3:56:12] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Ball is you
[3:56:13] <Delenay> i saw it on the ramp
[3:56:18] <ArtooKilledYou> If there were four balls, then that’s a jojo reference
[3:56:19] <%AncelDeLambert> shinny? He should use his calves?
[3:56:23] <subjectg> BALL is STUCK
[3:56:24] <majindusto> Nah, to become Jar-Jar...Pat would need to constantly say "Meesa" before everything he says
[3:56:27] <Gorgen> @palebluedots Its reason to exist is MONEY. Star wars prints money.
[3:56:27] <otakon17> Push the busted wall?
[3:56:28] <CybertronPrime> You've seen a third ball somewhere before.
[3:56:32] <Monkeyweed21> no he isnt
[3:56:37] <+ontoue> holy shit i just looked up a picture of the Skungus, it has eyes it's an animal, I thought it was a plant lmao
[3:56:38] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @palebluedots I think the reason for this game existing is money. No need to over-analyze it all.
[3:56:44] <%ShichiNoBushi> Big push.
[3:56:45] <%JJCheeker> Ball is smarter than Pat
[3:56:46] <+polaroidjackson> i just showed up is the game worth a shit so far
[3:56:48] <dawnks> Is this game good?
[3:56:49] <+Punchasaur> The idea that games HAVE to innovate is why miyamoto keeps ruining games nowadays
[3:56:57] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @palebluedots I'm pretty certain it exists because a souls game with tomb raider elements is nifty.
[3:56:58] <FunkyStreams> This flute playing in the background is perfect for this.
[3:57:03] <artoflec> @Punchasaur god you're so right NotLikeThis
[3:57:06] <DatAsuna> @AngriestPat you should maybe go back to the first planet with force push after this
[3:57:08] <Hellarussian> huh
[3:57:08] <%MelBrooksKA> It looks fine @dawnks
[3:57:09] <%AncelDeLambert> @dawnks it's middle of the road AAA
[3:57:20] <otakon17> HAHA I knew it
[3:57:22] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> big brain
[3:57:22] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> @Punchasaur oh come on, he's only ruined the paper mario ones
[3:57:25] <+palebluedots> @Sphincter_Spelunker That's the problem. There is no creative thought put into the game.
[3:57:25] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Personally, I think the game dangling basic force abilities over your head like a carrot is pretty annoying
[3:57:30] <otakon17> we have THIRD ball now
[3:57:33] <FunkyStreams> Look at those Frobite physics.
[3:57:34] <+Reizie_Etherealm> A game being fun > A game being unique
[3:57:37] <dawnks> interesting i see
[3:57:38] <+shnoz_berries> lul
[3:57:50] <majindusto> CAN WE GET A FOURTH?
[3:57:52] <artoflec> chibi robo was supposed to be a point and click adventure thing and miyamoto insisted it to be a really shitty platformer instead
[3:57:52] <%Anime_Flux> pff whatever, game looks fun to me
[3:58:00] <%seaearthandsky> @palebluedots this is literally a matter of opinion, for some people something can be enjoyable with out the need to be reinvent things, if you need more than thats fine but thats literally what you like versus what someone else likes. people like what they like
[3:58:00] <otakon17> can we get a QUAD?
[3:58:03] <DatAsuna> game is fun, but yeah
[3:58:04] <%AncelDeLambert> typically a game being generic interferes with it being fun, because you've played it before
[3:58:12] <%Laecerelius> ARGH! SHEPHARD, MY QUAD!!
[3:58:14] <DatAsuna> it is a bit underwhelming that the unlockable powers are such basic ones
[3:58:15] <Hellarussian> oh
[3:58:17] <mostundesired> This is some real BOTW shit.
[3:58:17] <+Ell1ot> lol
[3:58:19] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Shepard. Wrex.
[3:58:25] <Chumblago13> So that's a no on boss fights being cool sofar?
[3:58:26] <majindusto> MULTIBALL!!!!
[3:58:26] <%LiquidShake83> lol
[3:58:27] <otakon17> lol
[3:58:27] <DisGuyOvahEre> HA
[3:58:28] <CybertronPrime> Interdasting

[3:58:28] <trianglehat> hah
[3:58:29] <%Finakala> Pfft

[3:58:30] <+VektorTroika> Rube Zoidberg Contraption Action
[3:58:31] <+trustycoyote> Hahaha
[3:58:32] <FunkyStreams> O_O
[3:58:32] <lyzejag> I fucking jumped
[3:58:32] <dawnks> LUL
[3:58:33] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> ball in da face
[3:58:34] <%Maids4lyfe> pat
[3:58:35] <%joylent_blue> that scared me LUL
[3:58:37] <otakon17> same I jumped
[3:58:39] <%SWFanatic> now you're thinking with balls
[3:58:43] <OToole42> considering the main character is a padawan, it makes sense he only knows basic powers
[3:58:45] <Hellarussian> BIG smart
[3:58:48] <%Anime_Flux> It's definitely cooler than I was expecting, though my expectations were LOW
[3:58:49] <trianglehat> big brain
[3:58:50] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> OOH nice!
[3:58:51] <otakon17> SMART BRAIN
[3:58:52] <%AncelDeLambert> I can't believe that WORKED
[3:58:53] <otakon17> push and slow
[3:58:54] <subjectg> Just sitting around fondling your balls
[3:58:57] <+Punchasaur> “If it’s not fun, what’s the point” - Reggie our lord and savior
[3:59:00] <otakon17> and NOW WE HAVE A QUAD
[3:59:00] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> is he still a padawan?
[3:59:00] <%ShichiNoBushi> Biggest smart.
[3:59:01] <WalkingErection01> imagine going onto a stream and the only contribution to chat you make is "Dis game is boring"
[3:59:01] <DisGuyOvahEre> imagine getting jumpscared by your own big smart brain
[3:59:02] <%Finakala> MORE balls
[3:59:03] <%Laecerelius> Brute. Smarts.
[3:59:04] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> MORE BALLS
[3:59:04] <%Capta1n_H3nry> Holy fuck
[3:59:05] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> This is making me miss that free pinball game that was pre-installed in Windows
[3:59:06] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @OToole42 I guess the frustration can be rewarding, in a way
[3:59:06] <+palebluedots> @seaearthandsky I am talking about creativity not enjoyment. This is a piece of art in the end.
[3:59:13] <%Capta1n_H3nry> Sasuga Respawn
[3:59:15] <Tedious_Tickles> Time to save Big Hat Logan
[3:59:16] <majindusto> Pat, Do not take Balls to the Face!!!
[3:59:18] <Hellarussian> huh
[3:59:24] <zipfile777> O OW
[3:59:28] <lyzejag> F
[3:59:29] <trianglehat> oof
[3:59:31] <otakon17> and BACK WE GO
[3:59:31] <theKingRamses> rip
[3:59:32] <%AncelDeLambert> LUL
[3:59:32] <%ImmaCanuck> sfoxLOL shaunfHa
[3:59:32] <AzirothTheGreat> pat. the upgrade
[3:59:33] <Hellarussian> UP WE GO
[3:59:33] <%Laecerelius> BIG UP
[3:59:34] <%SWFanatic> See the ancient Grouchos KNEW you'd remember a basic jedi ability FORCE PUSH and designed this whole dungeon around it
[3:59:34] <%LaughingCatt> it go up
[3:59:34] <%Anime_Flux> Up we go!
[3:59:35] <Bigbossman91> @AngriestPat you can go down again
[3:59:36] <mostundesired> CRAZY TALK
[3:59:36] <thetruenicster> Foolishness, Pat. Foolishness
[3:59:42] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @Sphincter_Spelunker I loved that game. That and the one where you played the skier and had to run away from the abominable snowman.
[3:59:42] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> that's a lot of work to use an elevator
[3:59:42] <+xBolts4Lifex> LUL
[3:59:42] <%Capta1n_H3nry> "Don't go up"
[3:59:44] <+VektorTroika> @WalkingErection01 because sithposting is fun
[3:59:47] <%Finakala> Pat's about to have a Kylo Ren angsty moment
[3:59:49] <artoflec> @palebluedots ah the goal posts have moved I see
[3:59:49] <Ion_Laser> @Sphincter_Spelunker Space Cadet SeemsGood
[3:59:49] <Dr_Mooose> kill the elevator
[3:59:49] <robwob2016> YOOOOOO
[3:59:51] <+TheBitingIrish> Wookie time :D
[3:59:53] <robwob2016> WOOKIE TIME
[3:59:56] <%Capta1n_H3nry> *immedieatly presses button*
[3:59:57] <reonome> oooh thats a nice touch
[3:59:57] <Edjager97> HAAAAA
[3:59:58] <%RobotPancake> @palebluedots I think the characters can be unique. Too early but Greezy is great. the scale is unique and level design seems far more elaborate that I thought. The ability to force stop objects is relatively new since Kylo was the first time I saw it. That's small.
[4:00:01] <%seaearthandsky> @palebluedots you conflating video games with art. video games as a medium are literally made for enjoyment, which is as a subjective as it can get
[4:00:03] <SchroedingersFerret> I hope we se Chewie so I can CLAP
[4:00:04] <otakon17> "LET ME EXPLORE DAMN YOUT!"
[4:00:07] <collind99> You’ll be able to go back down @angriestpat
[4:00:11] <+Grizzytron> there's so much to explore in this fucking game
[4:00:12] <TonyPullMyDTRedgrave> @palebluedots it's a video game in the end... which is meant to be fun above all else. If it has a message or adds new stuff or whatever that's nice bonus stuff but games are meant to be fun. if it fits that criteria i think that's fine imo
[4:00:14] <WalkingErection01> @VektorTroika HA.....sithposting , i like what you did there
[4:00:14] <Monkeyweed21> what did you expect Cumbo
[4:00:20] <otakon17> plus no quick travel
[4:00:27] <otakon17> you gotta trek every time
[4:00:28] <majindusto> "Kylo Ren Temper Tantrum" Time!!!
[4:00:29] <+JavaManJoJo> gotta mask them loading screens
[4:00:29] <otakon17> nope
[4:00:31] <Hellarussian> U SUPER CANT
[4:00:31] <reonome> uh oh
[4:00:32] <otakon17> that's it FOR NOW
[4:00:32] <theKingRamses> you can
[4:00:32] <+DrunkenDice> LUL
[4:00:33] <ScreamLord> LOAD
[4:00:36] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Big stumbo
[4:00:36] <subjectg> Are we gonna go mess with wookiee tribal politics again?
[4:00:38] <prophetdisharmonious> do wookies do no shave november?
[4:00:38] <%JJCheeker> But what about the wookies
[4:00:39] <%animalxer> push the goats off the stone
[4:00:39] <pillowwasp> When does starkiller show up
[4:00:43] <+Grizzytron> step out and back in, it's dumb
[4:00:43] <otakon17> you can probably get back in later
[4:00:46] <Bigbossman91> @AngriestPat rest then go down
[4:00:50] <+CrazyRainbows> lmao
[4:00:53] <%Finakala> You'll probably get the Lordvessel at some point
[4:00:53] <+VektorTroika> @WalkingErection01 "sithspit" was a star wars curse word back in the day too
[4:00:53] <otakon17> Exploraaaaaaaaaaaaaaaation!
[4:01:00] <artoflec> if you're going to bother arguing what is subjectively "fun" to you and then go to what is "creative" to you there's no discussion to be had elaWeird
[4:01:03] <otakon17> Soft Elmo, good Elmo
[4:01:04] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Is this a loading screen?
[4:01:06] <RushUnplugged> Pat stop having fun with the game, chat decided it's not fun
[4:01:07] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> @pillowwasp what if we were playing starkiller the whole time?
[4:01:08] <samuelfisk> Why are forest bears one of the most long standing allies of the Jedi?
[4:01:09] <+ontoue> skungus
[4:01:10] <%nekodelic> going up?
[4:01:13] <trianglehat> no elevator music
[4:01:13] <+Punchasaur> Go meet Han Solos dog
[4:01:13] <%GarbageQueenEllie> pure pazaak
[4:01:14] <+Grizzytron> I did everything I could on first visit to zeffo and apparently I didn't find half of the shit that's there
[4:01:15] <otakon17> this is basically a loading screen
[4:01:18] <+Reizie_Etherealm> If only you can snitch on a wookie and get paid for it in this game
[4:01:18] <pillowwasp> @thatoneguyyousaw oh shit!
[4:01:22] <otakon17> but hey I'd rather have this than a static screen
[4:01:22] <WalkingErection01> @VektorTroika oh shit i didnt even know that. learn something new everyday
[4:01:25] <%realm_forge> Vick that place go party with the Wookiees!
[4:01:25] <%SlagChambers> reminds me of Mass Effect
[4:01:26] <ape_hawk> everything is a loading screen
[4:01:28] <Tedious_Tickles> gotta hide those load screens
[4:01:28] <Dr_Mooose> but it doesn't say "loading..."
[4:01:29] <otakon17> I liked the elevators for Mass Effect
[4:01:33] <FunkyStreams> Pretty cool this game was made by the same guys that did CoD 4
[4:01:37] <%honeyman18> Do you think you'll blow up the secret death star?
[4:01:37] <ape_hawk> technically, the entire game is a loading screen
[4:01:37] <+trustycoyote> so it IS Metroid Prime!
[4:01:42] <otakon17> Respawn made COD4?
[4:01:43] <Tedious_Tickles> same guys who did Titanfall too
[4:01:46] <collind99> Go to that big circular room and do a puzzle and you get a Force or health upgrade @angriestpat
[4:01:49] <otakon17> time to EXPLORE
[4:01:51] <artoflec> where are the PORGS guys?
[4:01:56] <otakon17> The Skungus calls to us
[4:01:57] <trianglehat> plumbus
[4:01:58] <SchroedingersFerret> How gross do you think a wookie's ass must be? It must be caked in feces.
[4:01:58] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Mass Effect elevators were secretly great, because you got to hear your companions talk.
[4:01:59] <otakon17> not here yet
[4:02:00] <%Anime_Flux> p-plumbus?
[4:02:01] <%GarbageQueenEllie> the cumbuc
[4:02:01] <+palebluedots> @RobotPancake The force powers are nothing new at all, just a collection of abilities from previous games. Character wise there is not much there, and even if there was, that's not adding anything that hasn't already existed.
[4:02:03] <pillowwasp> Is this guy as cool as Starkiller tho?
[4:02:03] <+OkamiDude15> so did pat get force push or naw?
[4:02:05] <Bigbossman91> @artoflec not on this planet
[4:02:05] <%SWFanatic> Become as SKUNGUS
[4:02:12] <prophetdisharmonious> when do we find out about the reapers?
[4:02:13] <artoflec> @Bigbossman91 artofl1Sad
[4:02:16] <extradopeness> SKUMBO
[4:02:17] <Rotwik> @artoflec Delicious
[4:02:23] <artoflec> @Rotwik elaD
[4:02:28] <subjectg> When do we get to play pazaak?
[4:02:31] <+OkamiDude15> nice
[4:02:32] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> It's chrismin
[4:02:32] <otakon17> @King_Wolf_Rigger EXACTLY I loved the conversations they had especially Wrex and his "Who would win in a fight between you and Shepard?" convos
[4:02:41] <%Finakala> Wrex is the best
[4:02:42] <otakon17> Push the ratto
[4:02:47] <+VektorTroika> *Life Day
[4:02:50] <trianglehat> elmo move
[4:02:52] <otakon17> Urdnot Wrex was a goddamn lad
[4:02:52] <+twohitgood> don't forget to force push your skungus
[4:02:56] <%MelBrooksKA> Rats, rats, we're the rats
[4:03:00] <%seaearthandsky> @palebluedots it doesn't HAVE to add something new
[4:03:12] <%joylent_blue> saying a game has to have a completely new idea in it in order to have merit is frankly a ridiculous statement
[4:03:13] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @otakon17 Wrex was probs the best written character of that console generation.
[4:03:13] <+VektorTroika> We're gonna make to Kashyyyk in time for Life Day guys!
[4:03:21] <%Anime_Flux> LUL
[4:03:27] <%animalxer> turn off the vents
[4:03:27] <otakon17> @King_Wolf_Rigger I loved Wrex, my fav squaddie
[4:03:28] <extradopeness> When do we get to hear MOOCHU SHAKA PAKA
[4:03:31] <%Finakala> I'm gonna laugh if that ball slams into him
[4:03:32] <%Neo_Kaiser> Marble Madness!
[4:03:33] <prophetdisharmonious> Wrex's best moment was in the citadel DLC. you know the one
[4:03:46] <trianglehat> turn off that wind
[4:03:50] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @VektorTroika plz no. I don't want to see his kid.
[4:03:53] <otakon17> @prophetdisharmonious I miss playing the Citadel DLC now, that was SUCH a great swan song for the series
[4:03:58] <%WackyGear> @AngriestPat push the ball into the center of the room
[4:03:58] <artoflec> I'd rather a game include the things that SHOULD be there and execute on them well than have some new half baked mechanic in trade for all the fundamentals.
[4:04:02] <+palebluedots> @seaearthandsky It doesn't have to, but when it doesn't, it is creatively bankrupt.
[4:04:04] <+Punchasaur> 👽
[4:04:14] <otakon17> bad ratties bad! you should try pushing them when they charge
[4:04:14] <%AncelDeLambert> KAAAAAAAsheeta
[4:04:15] <+Tunamanguy> oh so you can cut THESE guys in half
[4:04:17] <%seaearthandsky> @palebluedots and?
[4:04:28] <collind99> The ball will be able to break the wall
[4:04:31] <prophetdisharmonious> @otakon17 it was so much better than anything previous
[4:04:32] <%honeyman18> Itsike the protheans? they just assumed anyone who'd find it could hear that shit with their mind I guess?
[4:04:35] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Star Wars IS creatively bankrupt
[4:04:36] <%seaearthandsky> @palebluedots if its fun then its doing its job
[4:04:37] <+palebluedots> @seaearthandsky and its a bad piece of art
[4:04:38] <Rotwik> blocking a rat with a lightsaber should just kill it right?
[4:04:49] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Guys, guys. ALL video games are garbage. New, old, they're all a waste of time. That's why I dedicate my life to watching and playing them. Every day.
[4:04:53] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Should
[4:04:55] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @otakon17 I loved in Mass Effect 2 when you headbutt a Krogan, and he bursts out laughing.
[4:04:55] <FunkyStreams> ball tech
[4:04:58] <Hellarussian> huh
[4:04:59] <artoflec> @GarbageQueenEllie hell yeah
[4:05:03] <otakon17> @prophetdisharmonious agreed, best DLC of the bunch for ME3 which I still think was a really good game overall
[4:05:03] <%Capta1n_H3nry> @Rotwik But vidya game though
[4:05:10] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> @GarbageQueenEllie this gal knows whats up
[4:05:12] <%AncelDeLambert> hooray, more fart gas!

[4:05:40] <otakon17> Zeffo are the Chozo in this game
[4:05:41] <%MelBrooksKA> @extradopeness lewd
[4:05:42] <%seaearthandsky> @palebluedots it is a video game, not a piece of art. that is not the point of this game. video games can be art, but that is not a necessity
[4:05:45] <otakon17> he's a loofa

[4:06:00] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Elmo is 12
[4:06:00] <OToole42> @palebluedots I think the problem is you're comparing different types of games, its like film, you got your Rambo movie, then you got citizin Kane, the same can be said of this ant KOTOR 2, both are games, but we enjoy them in different ways for different reasons
[4:06:03] <+Yash3ahuja> @AngriestPat how are you liking this game so far?
[4:06:29] <+Punchasaur> I want there to be a xenomorph in this game
[4:06:31] <otakon17> I think I'm gonna grab this game
[4:06:38] <otakon17> GOD Pat you ain't kidding
[4:06:44] <extradopeness> EMLO
[4:06:44] <%Finakala> Was KOTOR the last good one?
[4:06:46] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat likes Big Dumb, it makes him giggle
[4:06:46] <+ATentacleMonster> refreshing to hear
[4:06:46] <Big_King_Coconut> LUL
[4:06:47] <Tedious_Tickles> too long since a good one
[4:06:47] <Hellarussian> nice
[4:06:49] <%AncelDeLambert> LUL
[4:06:50] <majindusto> ahhhhhh
[4:06:50] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> pfff
[4:06:51] <DatAsuna> SWTOR was the last good one
[4:06:52] <artoflec> LUL
[4:06:52] <%ArcanumMBD> @OToole42 yo get that sane rational thinking out of here. outrage only
[4:06:53] <Tedious_Tickles> good job
[4:06:54] <AzirothTheGreat> toss blob
[4:06:55] <otakon17> you ALMOST Hank Hill "B'wahd!"
[4:06:58] <RushUnplugged> Pat stop, chat said the game is bad, you can't have fun
[4:06:58] <%supersugoisenpai1> look out for that hole Pat
[4:07:03] <+Lostinafantasy> Did Pat go to Darthmir yet?
[4:07:08] <%Typhaeon> Nope
[4:07:09] <+Yash3ahuja> @AngriestPat that's great to hear. I work at Respawn actually haha. Really excited to see you and Max play it
[4:07:09] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> butt y wuld u give EA ur $$$?
[4:07:09] <DatAsuna> So, 2011 launch for SWTOR
[4:07:10] <%AncelDeLambert> I call shenanigans on that updraft!
[4:07:11] <artoflec> but i LOVE fun artofl1Sad
[4:07:12] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Hey. I liked base game SWTOR...
[4:07:12] <collind99> Will you be using the yellow blade color when you get it because of Mustard Lady? @angriestpat
[4:07:15] <DatAsuna> Still a long time
[4:07:15] <%MelBrooksKA> But Pat, how could you possibly enjoy a single player game? spyCappa
[4:07:18] <otakon17> SWTOR is..okay
[4:07:19] <%a_lucky_soul> i got this game in the hope that ea will allow more single players story mode games but i doubt it
[4:07:25] <OToole42> @ArcanumMBD sorry, REEEEE bad art game fun
[4:07:27] <otakon17> I just WISH we had another proper TOR RPG
[4:07:27] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Damn it's been 4 hours and our boi Cal has Force push and a fussy kick. They sure are going for the long haul, here. I can respect that. Even if I can't choke peeps
[4:07:28] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Dread Masters were cool
[4:07:29] <+VektorTroika> @DatAsuna 2011 was eight years back
[4:07:29] <%AncelDeLambert> Orange Guardian beam color is best color!
[4:07:33] <prophetdisharmonious> SWTOR is good, if you ignore infinite empire, which was really bnad
[4:07:34] <trianglehat> sniff all the force gas
[4:07:36] <otakon17> damn that's a LOT of XP
[4:07:40] <Dr_Mooose> feel that hate
[4:07:41] <asurite_warrior> @AngriestPat just jumped into the stream hows the game so far?
[4:07:42] <Gorgen> thats some good hate crikGasm
[4:07:43] <%TheAsianAvenger96> The last good stars wars gmae I played was KOTOR
[4:07:44] <otakon17> you just need ONE kill for askill point Pattyboy
[4:07:49] <beetbo2> Let the HATE flow through you
[4:07:50] <DatAsuna> @VektorTroika Hence "still a long time"
[4:07:50] <Hellarussian> OOMF
[4:07:52] <%joylent_blue> asurite_warrior he likes it quite a bit
[4:07:59] <otakon17> @TheAsianAvenger96 that and the original Battlefronts
[4:08:01] <+VektorTroika> @DatAsuna ah, missed that part
[4:08:06] <+Punchasaur> Hate of the act lol
[4:08:10] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Suffer not the xenos to live! HATE!
[4:08:10] <%WackyGear> @AngriestPat what about throwing that plant at the door
[4:08:11] <otakon17> A Ginger Jedi
[4:08:15] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> But where are the big tiddy twileks
[4:08:17] <otakon17> EL-0
[4:08:18] <prophetdisharmonious> can gingers be jedi?
[4:08:19] <ape_hawk> but can you Force Shit Your Pants???
[4:08:19] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Sing not the Gingers
[4:08:21] <%ShichiNoBushi> E7-M0
[4:08:22] <%Anime_Flux> A Ginji
[4:08:26] <beetbo2> E7-M0
[4:08:27] <DatAsuna> I don't hate zakuul in concept, I just hate how they rushed it instead of developing further
[4:08:30] <+Punchasaur> The Last Ginger
[4:08:31] <otakon17> E1-M0
[4:08:31] <+joekuta71> LM0-1
[4:08:32] <%animalxer> went the wrong way pt
[4:08:34] <%a_lucky_soul> circle dingdong
[4:08:37] <beetbo2> LMO-1
[4:08:39] <beetbo2> perfect
[4:08:39] <otakon17> @joekuta71 very good
[4:08:40] <collind99> Pat turn around
[4:08:41] <DatAsuna> Overreacting to bad feedback led to throwing away potential
[4:08:45] <beetbo2> joetuka did it
[4:08:46] <prophetdisharmonious> @DatAsuna fair
[4:08:48] <otakon17> L-M0
[4:08:50] <beetbo2> he named the boy
[4:08:51] <ElemeNtxt> this game is better tomb raider than tomb raider nowdays
[4:08:52] <FunkyStreams> did the droid just point int he direction of progress?
[4:09:01] <otakon17> this game REALLY needs stealth kills I swear
[4:09:07] <collind99> You missed something in the room with the moveable pillar @angriestpat
[4:09:08] <+VektorTroika> E1-M0 is that one DooM level nobody plays
[4:09:09] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @DatAsuna They did write themselves into a corner trying to wrap that up
[4:09:10] <%Anime_Flux> man, force push really trivializes this mob
[4:09:10] <DatAsuna> Handled Right, vaylin coulda been an Azula level clssic Villain but they botched her
[4:09:17] <prophetdisharmonious> Ayyyyy
[4:09:17] <otakon17> BEGONE THOT!
[4:09:18] <NeroInfinite> NICE
[4:09:19] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> @otakon17 lightsaber too loud
[4:09:24] <%Laecerelius> VERY cool
[4:09:24] <FunkyStreams> no nvm. Think he was just stretching out his lil droid legs.
[4:09:26] <%AncelDeLambert> suck it, Tarkus
[4:09:32] <%AncelDeLambert> mmmm, fart gas
[4:09:33] <otakon17> FULL FORCE JUICE!
[4:09:35] <%Laecerelius> Yaaay!
[4:09:39] <trianglehat> sniff it
[4:09:42] <otakon17> Gimme that juice
[4:09:43] <%ShichiNoBushi> Skungas
[4:09:44] <DatAsuna> @Sphincter_Spelunker kinda happens when you try to tell a 3 expansion plan story in 2 where the second is reduced budget
[4:09:47] <Hellarussian> aalways inhale the force juice
[4:09:52] <%MelBrooksKA> Got our plorb
[4:09:54] <DatAsuna> IT all comes back to anthem stealing their resources
[4:09:55] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @DatAsuna OH MY GOD. Arcaan was just Zuko! NotLikeThis
[4:09:57] <%Anime_Flux> Delicious, delicious force juice
[4:09:58] <Tedious_Tickles> It's a P-Orb like in DMC, collect 3 for more juice
[4:10:01] <otakon17> Blue Milk
[4:10:01] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Somebody did some iconoclast shit on the Wind Worshippers. Jedi Inquisition?
[4:10:03] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> HE EVEN HAS THE SCAR
[4:10:04] <%AncelDeLambert> Ain't my fault that I'm out here feeling loose gotta blame it on Force JUICE
[4:10:09] <otakon17> UGH
[4:10:17] <otakon17> Mutliplayer WOULD ONLY WORK if it was co-op
[4:10:19] <%joylent_blue> ughhhhh
[4:10:20] <DatAsuna> The deceived cinematic is still GOAT
[4:10:21] <Dehlome> INVASIONS
[4:10:21] <otakon17> CO-OP or bust
[4:10:22] <%ssjklyco> Great pat, you added multiplayer to it now
[4:10:22] <Dr_Mooose> you know it's coming
[4:10:23] <Zombrocom> Dead space it?
[4:10:23] <King_Necrow> what about invasions?
[4:10:24] <+OkamiDude15> microtransaction
[4:10:25] <Fryclan> its a forb like force orb
[4:10:25] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> asymmetrical multiplayer where one player plays the droid
[4:10:26] <+Crippl3> No way, Jedi Outcast and Jedi Academy fucking ruled
[4:10:26] <FunkyStreams> good thoughts,Pat.
[4:10:26] <%Typhaeon> The entire mechanics of this are single player oriented
[4:10:27] <Big_King_Coconut> needs PVP Kappa
[4:10:34] <%joylent_blue> zero lessons learned
[4:10:34] <+crusaderthree7gamer> crusaderthree7gamer subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months! 
[4:10:35] <%Finakala> Multiplayer wouldn't necessarily break it by itself, Dead Space 2 was still fantastic
[4:10:38] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Co Op on this game would be fun
[4:10:38] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Gettin loosey goosey for the Force Juicy.
[4:10:40] <%Finakala> But it would lead to Dead Space 3
[4:10:42] <%Typhaeon> They'd have to remake Jedi Outcast combat for MP to work
[4:10:42] <otakon17> @Big_King_Coconut I wills strangel you like Ghsot Dad
[4:10:45] <+joekuta71> Invasions as Sith ghosts would be kinda sick though
[4:10:46] <%ShichiNoBushi> It's a Souls-like, right? So just have other players showing up as Force phantoms or whatever.
[4:10:48] <%Savarro> Why wouldn't you want multiplayer when it worked SO well for Dead Space LUL
[4:10:52] <Hellarussian> thats a funky run
[4:10:52] <beetbo2> Multiplayer AFTER single player release
[4:10:54] <GenericTwitchAcc1> so, how are we hating the game so far gang?
[4:10:54] <DatAsuna> @Sphincter_Spelunker that's rough buddy
[4:10:56] <otakon17> that run cycle animation is a LITTLE silly though
[4:10:58] <collind99> Oh nevermind I thought you hadn’t gotten that @angriestpat my bad
[4:11:00] <beetbo2> like, a month-year after
[4:11:00] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @ShichiNoBushi YES! And have invasions too!
[4:11:00] <subjectg> to be fair, multiplayer for this game would actually be sick
[4:11:03] <%joylent_blue> GenericTwitchAcc1 eh, its fine actually
[4:11:07] <otakon17> CO OP would be sick
[4:11:07] <DisGuyOvahEre> "Dark Spirit *xXxDarth Nader 420xXx has invaded"
[4:11:10] <%a_lucky_soul> keep the multiplayer to battlefront
[4:11:10] <Admiral_PopnFresh> I mean, multiplayer jedis is a thing, it can be done poorly like DICE Battlefront, or well like Movie Battles 2
[4:11:11] <GenericTwitchAcc1> dang shame
[4:11:11] <Tedious_Tickles> Invaded by Sith Lord XxLord DouchessXx
[4:11:12] <%Laecerelius> Summon force ghosts to help you, but watch out for the red sith ghosts!
[4:11:13] <prophetdisharmonious> @joekuta71 Invaded by dark spirit Revan
[4:11:20] <kylecorr> if they have the saber combat like jedi academy trukBoomer
[4:11:23] <beetbo2> Forvce GHOSTS!
[4:11:26] <%AncelDeLambert> nah, the only soulsian aspect this game has is the corpse run, ie the WORST PART of soulsians
[4:11:27] <mankeyfigh> @angriestpat Wouldn’t a Jedi PvP 1v1 combat arena be tight as hell tho?
[4:11:31] <beetbo2> force ghosts as co-op/invaders!
[4:11:38] <otakon17> ah the corpse run
[4:11:43] <$Piemono> He's got a weird run
[4:11:44] <otakon17> I hate corpse runs
[4:11:47] <BeefyQueefer> !uptime
[4:11:47] <Tedious_Tickles> It is EA after all
[4:11:47] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 11m.
[4:11:49] <%Capta1n_H3nry> Thanks EA
[4:11:51] <+Punchasaur> “sekiro sucked cuz you only get the one sword” “fallen order is good because the sword glows and makes noise” Kappa
[4:11:51] <collind99> I recommend Going to Dathomir after this it’s gorgeous and difficult @angriestpat
[4:11:54] <beetbo2> Corpse runs into Microtransactions
[4:11:55] <mayorrev> thanks EA
[4:11:57] <Fryclan> curse you eaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
[4:11:59] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @AngriestPat MicroTransactions are the way of the Dark Side
[4:12:03] <Dr_Mooose> $10 for a better force powers
[4:12:05] <%seaearthandsky> @AncelDeLambert also takes the inspiration for shot cuts galore and things like that
[4:12:07] <SuperCreeperBlocks> He’s got a run like he Shit himself
[4:12:07] <GenericTwitchAcc1> just climb lol 4Head
[4:12:07] <Hellarussian> buy all the MTX for the brand
[4:12:08] <kylecorr> want a gold vader skin 10 bucks trukBoomer
[4:12:08] <theKingRamses> move a ball
[4:12:09] <DatAsuna> the longer we go without anyone doing jedi academy combat the better ff my eventual jedi academy spiritual sucesor will be lol
[4:12:10] <collind99> Jedi For Honor would be dope @angriestpat
[4:12:12] <%a_lucky_soul> jedi knight series was great for pvp
[4:12:12] <DisGuyOvahEre> sith cant make force ghosts, they only inhabit/possess people or relics
[4:12:17] <%Anime_Flux> that music drop is so good
[4:12:17] <%Typhaeon> This is that dumb boss monster from Thor 1
[4:12:17] <mayorrev> tall boy
[4:12:18] <DisGuyOvahEre> so invading isn't possible
[4:12:19] <%joylent_blue> don't say PvP i'm still mad about the dmc5 steam page shenanigans
[4:12:19] <Monkeyweed21> climb
[4:12:20] <+TheBitingIrish> Use the overhead attack when it's disabled
[4:12:20] <King_Necrow> we on grandmaster mod?
[4:12:21] <FunkyStreams> Never have I sense a player backtrack as hard as Pat just did.
[4:12:22] <+restivewolf> can you go darkside
[4:12:23] <DatAsuna> YEs and no
[4:12:29] <DatAsuna> Sith can be force ghosts in legends
[4:12:29] <%LiquidShake83> mortis
[4:12:30] <%Finakala> @Typhaeon Yeah I said that earlier, it totally is
[4:12:30] <%Typhaeon> Corner trap
[4:12:30] <beetbo2> then maybe pvp's like Doom Eternal
[4:12:31] <%LouieRouie> very carefully
[4:12:31] <Tedious_Tickles> More like $10 for a chance at getting better force powers via loot box and "Star Cards"
[4:12:33] <GenericTwitchAcc1> nice T pose
[4:12:33] <%AncelDeLambert> has Pat tried force pushing it during its stomp?
[4:12:33] <MoulesFritz> geeeeeeeeeeet dunked on
[4:12:33] <Hellarussian> and thats how my story ends
[4:12:35] <beetbo2> they posess enemies
[4:12:35] <%SWFanatic> whoopsie doodle
[4:12:36] <prophetdisharmonious> Sith can haunt shit
[4:12:36] <DatAsuna> in canon they can't be ghosts period
[4:12:37] <trianglehat> can you hit the ball you push out his chest?
[4:12:37] <sonicblade38> Invaded by dark jedi stabz4less
[4:12:37] <mayorrev> wait you died? Where's your health?

[4:13:04] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @Hellarussian I love how that game is still being used as a meme all these years later.
[4:13:06] <collind99> Jedi For Honor would be dope as fuck @angriestpat
[4:13:07] <otakon17> the game needs some more battle music
[4:13:08] <+TheBitingIrish> The soundtrack tho
[4:13:08] <kylecorr> could you use dark force powers in this like force lightning
[4:13:08] <beetbo2> ELMO, give him a stim!
[4:13:09] <%AncelDeLambert> LUL
[4:13:13] <Big_King_Coconut> lol that robot just kicked you in the teeth
[4:13:13] <%Typhaeon> One hit to recover souls is very generous
[4:13:14] <BeefyQueefer> So how is the game so far? First stream I saw it crashed in 30 minutes and had camera freakouts.
[4:13:15] <collind99> No @kylecorr
[4:13:16] <GenericTwitchAcc1> first try
[4:13:18] <MoulesFritz> that was the most telegraphed kick of all time

[4:13:22] <Monkeyweed21> climb
[4:13:23] <@ShockzNDrawe> What secret is that?
[4:13:28] <otakon17> I bet they'll introduce a force skill that gives you life back when you kill an enemy
[4:13:33] <mankeyfigh> Chat is Pat done with this area? I think he’s done
[4:13:42] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @ShockzNDrawe The Secret of Nimh
[4:13:42] <%MelBrooksKA> @ShockzNDrawe more force juice
[4:13:47] <otakon17> I think he is done

[4:14:46] <%realm_forge> The music is amazing
[4:14:47] <collind99> @gorgen unreal 4
[4:14:49] <DisGuyOvahEre> BD cant detect BTs but BD can give you monster energy when you run out
[4:14:49] <%Finakala> BB-8 vs BB
[4:14:52] <otakon17> @majorchange it's default on browser, how do I change it?
[4:14:57] <prophetdisharmonious> oof
[4:14:59] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> @QueequegTheater you're not stealing, you're just making a copy, so it's k
[4:14:59] <otakon17> inb4 more deadlly Stormies are used
[4:15:00] <asurite_warrior> so how darksouls is this
[4:15:02] <beetbo2> @DisGuyOvahEre Legit, you're not wrong
[4:15:03] <+Nightmarecast> Is this game worth a month of origin premier to play it?
[4:15:06] <Bigbossman91> @AngriestPat you can get the scomp link for BD-1 on this planet btw
[4:15:07] <beetbo2> That's best
[4:15:08] <%seaearthandsky> why is that so true LUL ?
[4:15:09] <%Laecerelius> Look at these weak-ass bitches using highly advanced weaponry
[4:15:09] <dekkitout> The goats were demoted
[4:15:10] <otakon17> time to slaughter some imps
[4:15:10] <KeiPrime> this is unreal engine
[4:15:11] <%AncelDeLambert> the Jedi's greatest foe: NATURE
[4:15:12] <%ShichiNoBushi> @MoulesFritz It was. But it's officially BD-1, but I figured to combine them to BD-70Fuck.
[4:15:13] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Kill them all, Peter
[4:15:13] <mankeyfigh> @prophetdisharmonious lightning is cheap, I want force jump and lightsaber boomerang toss
[4:15:14] <+majorchange> @otakon17 not sure, ive always used the app
[4:15:16] <GenericTwitchAcc1> ????
[4:15:19] <%QueequegTheater> @ThatOneGuyYouSaw No, you're stealing a product without paying
[4:15:19] <Tedious_Tickles> Heads or Tails?
[4:15:21] <%Laecerelius> nothing compared to those space goats
[4:15:25] <%joylent_blue> otakon17 in the top right, click on your profile to get a drop down menu, dark mode option should be there
[4:15:27] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @otakon17 Click your icon in the top right

[4:15:50] <Hellarussian> oh
[4:15:50] <Tedious_Tickles> no you can't
[4:15:50] <prophetdisharmonious> how many rockets does it take to bring down a jedi?

[4:15:56] <%Laecerelius> Whelp
[4:15:57] <Moonlight_Grimoire> uh
[4:15:57] <DisGuyOvahEre> @AngriestPat would you trade your ability to sense BTs for more monsters on the clock?
[4:15:57] <bendatron> well then

[4:16:08] <asurite_warrior> @AngriestPat wait you didnt even fallover
[4:16:08] <%AncelDeLambert> nice quality assurance, EA
[4:16:08] <%Laecerelius> force push rockets?
[4:16:08] <butthurtdave> pat try and stasis a rocket and see if you can push it
[4:16:11] <%a_lucky_soul> friendly fire is on
[4:16:14] <+xBolts4Lifex> how did this get a 9? LUL
[4:16:15] <Hellarussian> YEYEYE
[4:16:16] <%joylent_blue> LUL
[4:16:16] <otakon17> They killed the goast, ergo more dangerous
[4:16:17] <Big_King_Coconut> wouldn't slow-moving rockets be the WORST thing to use against a jedi?
[4:16:17] <%Ner234> JANK
[4:16:18] <KeiPrime> what difficulty is he playin at?
[4:16:23] <Admiral_PopnFresh> LUL
[4:16:25] <GenericTwitchAcc1> Y E E T
[4:16:28] <%joylent_blue> i was HOPING he wouldn't grab the ledge
[4:16:29] <collind99> It’s a good game with a tiny bit of Kano
[4:16:29] <datmouse> BLAST EM
[4:16:30] <Tedious_Tickles> force push those rockets
[4:16:33] <WaitHowDidIGetHere> Raid on the Jedi Temple Aug. 20. They can’t stop all of us!
[4:16:34] <subjectg> clearly they know you’re a shit jedi
[4:16:35] <+Punchasaur> ACTUAL JEDI CONFIRMED WORSE WITH THE FORCE THAN JESSE FROM CONTROL
[4:16:36] <rockmansrb2> Jank
[4:16:41] <%joylent_blue> KeiPrime second hardest
[4:16:41] <%Niney_Who> Is there anything about Jedi Religion or whatever that says you can't use a lightsaber AND a gun?
[4:16:42] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> you could totally reflect rockets in the Havoc Battlefronts
[4:16:47] <%Finakala> Those rockets actually do less damage than the goats
[4:16:53] <trianglehat> watch feet
[4:16:54] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @Niney_Who Unless you
[4:16:54] <otakon17> damn blew up his own GUY
[4:16:54] <King_Necrow> rocket man
[4:16:54] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> I mean, Pandemic
[4:16:57] <dekkitout> @Niney_Who Essentially, yes
[4:16:59] <%Niney_Who> Woah where did my stuff go
[4:17:00] <Gorgen> BLUE ON BLUE
[4:17:01] <%Niney_Who> weird
[4:17:09] <zipfile777> LUL
[4:17:11] <GenericTwitchAcc1> LUL
[4:17:11] <%kenstank> his dying noises are dramatic lol
[4:17:12] <+majorchange> LUL
[4:17:12] <Admiral_PopnFresh> @Sphincter_Spelunker I get angry every time
[4:17:12] <%LiquidShake83> mortis
[4:17:13] <%AncelDeLambert> LUL
[4:17:13] <KeiPrime> yeah the way these shots are chunking his health that makes sense
[4:17:14] <DisGuyOvahEre> why does the force push not do damage
[4:17:16] <%Laecerelius> if only you could heal
[4:17:16] <%Typhaeon> Pushed to a better position LuL
[4:17:16] <otakon17> Pat you need to learn to heal when in the red
[4:17:17] <asurite_warrior> is this combat fun it seems kinda slow
[4:17:18] <%SWFanatic> go faster die faster
[4:17:20] <%joylent_blue> hey pat watch out
[4:17:20] <%TDAWS_MP132> try pushing the rockets?
[4:17:21] <BeefyQueefer> HE CAN'T KILL ALL OF US
[4:17:21] <prophetdisharmonious> Rocket person sacrificed his friend
[4:17:21] <%joylent_blue> a rocket
[4:17:22] <Mariakko> Watch those wrist rockets!
[4:17:23] <%GraceTBM> i bet you can push those rockets back
[4:17:23] <KeiPrime> its almost like he got a power to deal with those rockets just now
[4:17:24] <DisGuyOvahEre> remember when force push did hella damage
[4:17:24] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @Niney_Who Agh, finger slipped, unless you're a weapon master, most jedi i think prefer to spend their points elsewhere
[4:17:27] <%QueequegTheater> Look at all this white on white violence Kappa
[4:17:27] <otakon17> Push does not do damage, hitting a surface does
[4:17:28] <Monkeyweed21> EASY MODE IS ABAILABLE
[4:17:28] <%Laecerelius> man healing would be so useful
[4:17:29] <+majorchange> star wars has so many races why do we have to play as a human again
[4:17:30] <FunkyStreams> The Troopers are pretty effective when theyre amoungst their ranks it seems.
[4:17:30] <%Laecerelius> if only
[4:17:31] <%AncelDeLambert> if only you could reflect their rockets with some kind of pushing force ability
[4:17:38] <mankeyfigh> Like in every game
[4:17:38] <jouzuyumi> use the force pat
[4:17:39] <SolverCODO> WHOA-AHH
[4:17:39] <%joylent_blue> Hello? pvpWhy
[4:17:42] <collind99> Get the rocket people first
[4:17:47] <bendatron> this game looks good but combat looks like it gets dry kinda quick
[4:17:48] <GenericTwitchAcc1> yes
[4:17:49] <rockmansrb2> Warning: This is where Max's game crashed.
[4:17:53] <%SWFanatic> Force PUSH rockets

[4:18:27] <%Anime_Flux> lol
[4:18:27] <prophetdisharmonious> anyone see that stormtroopers head start to bobble
[4:18:29] <+Punchasaur> A real Jedi wouldn’t need air boosters
[4:18:31] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> bobble headed storm trooper
[4:18:32] <medril07> tr8ter!
[4:18:35] <subjectg> They’re basically the firebomb undead
[4:18:35] <Humanpeep> vibrating stormtrooper
[4:18:36] <ha2ken> We got bobblehead stormtroopers
[4:18:36] <%JJCheeker> Can't believe this game came out I thought it was coming out later
[4:18:39] <based_versauen> Force push their rockets back at ‘em
[4:18:40] <%SWFanatic> Use the force
[4:18:43] <%joylent_blue> yeah its cool
[4:18:43] <+majorchange> LUL

[4:18:59] <Jam29Josh> So Pat did ya ever figure out that you can parry melee attacks in Death Stranding?
[4:19:01] <prophetdisharmonious> They can be felled, they can be beaten~
[4:19:02] <%GarbageQueenEllie> One thing I'll give this game, this is the most I've ever cared about the troopers
[4:19:03] <Monkeyweed21> now get that chest
[4:19:05] <Tedious_Tickles> Vortex Shield Unlocked!

[4:19:32] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Okay, anybody else think Zeffo sounds derogatory?
[4:19:34] <%Finakala> The map makes me think of new DOOM
[4:19:35] <+Punchasaur> Zeffomorph
[4:19:43] <otakon17> there's a breakable door above the area
[4:19:43] <+twohitgood> did he get the other case?
[4:19:48] <%realm_forge> Zeffo sounds like google’s next canceled project
[4:19:49] <Roach3s> Zeffos sounds like a race thing
[4:19:52] <KeiPrime> zeffo isnt derogatory, calling them zeffs maybe
[4:19:53] <%MelBrooksKA> Yes @Admiral_PopnFresh
[4:19:56] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @AngriestPat Plague is crushing this game. He's way better than you
[4:19:58] <otakon17> Zeffo sounds like a Zippo ripoff
[4:19:59] <%AncelDeLambert> omg what was the made up Zaibatsu slur?
[4:20:02] <Monkeyweed21> the chest pat
[4:20:02] <ODSTEvan147> Chest Pat

[4:20:23] <Zinax7> Hi, I'm Leon. I'm undefeated. This is my Charizard
[4:20:26] <Jam29Josh> What difficulty are you playing on?
[4:20:26] <+justianxix> Hes balder then you, cant beat him there
[4:20:26] <otakon17> oh Plague is playign too?
[4:20:27] <datmouse> LUL
[4:20:28] <%PROUD2beGINGER> The ancient Spagos
[4:20:35] <%MelBrooksKA> He draws better than you too spyCappa
[4:20:35] <%Finakala> The fact that they let id have extra time to make DOOM ETERNAL good gives me hope
[4:20:35] <GenericTwitchAcc1> he's WAY better than you at drawing furry shit Pat @AngriestPat
[4:20:39] <otakon17> his baldness gives him POWER
[4:20:40] <KeiPrime> NOW he is
[4:20:42] <King_Necrow> @ScreamLord did someone say microtransactions already planned
[4:20:43] <KeiPrime> in time..
[4:20:43] <%QueequegTheater> @AngriestPat Yeah, he's only better at video games, art, height, general hygiene, and charisma, he needs something Kappa
[4:20:43] <%AncelDeLambert> next planet will be the home of the noble SPAGGOS
[4:20:43] <%GarbageQueenEllie> If there's one thing I'm good at, it's fake racism
[4:20:45] <otakon17> that and the ladies
[4:20:47] <DevilDeus13> Pat starts crushing it at making furry art
[4:20:56] <otakon17> suddnely droid
[4:20:57] <%Savarro> Also fun fact: When you buy spaghettios, they ring up as spagos. I lost my shit in the store LUL
[4:21:00] <%miguelrod777> he wears his baldness better
[4:21:01] <prophetdisharmonious> How's pats furry drawing skills coming along? What's his fursona?
[4:21:02] <fusedforms> @DevilDeus13 NOT furry
[4:21:04] <DisGuyOvahEre> plague is the only member of the ustabiaz that hasn't succeded his original yet
[4:21:08] <%PROUD2beGINGER> He's better at animating
[4:21:10] <+TheBitingIrish> I wish they had given Machine Games more time to make The New Colossus good
[4:21:17] <otakon17> slide time!
[4:21:17] <GenericTwitchAcc1> weeee
[4:21:20] <+Punchasaur> My daughter ain’t marryin no zeffer!
[4:21:26] <%joylent_blue> i'm not sure the word charisma is applicable to Plague
[4:21:34] <%joylent_blue> he's beyond charisma
[4:21:36] <%AncelDeLambert> I want Pat to eat shit in one of those sliding sequences so bad
[4:21:43] <otakon17> he did earlier
[4:21:45] <KeiPrime> princess's secret slide all this level at the end
[4:21:48] <otakon17> slid off the edge
[4:21:49] <DisGuyOvahEre> right into a skeleton ball
[4:21:49] <%Tman451> Tman451 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 33 months! 33!
[4:21:51] <NotLysander> the movement looks chunkier than earlier in the game. does it feel different?
[4:21:52] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Actually, now that I think about it, Zeffer also sounds like the name of a Smuggler
[4:21:54] <NeroInfinite> he did earlier
[4:21:54] <otakon17> LIFE UP Pat you've been getting bodied a lot

[4:22:21] <%Finakala> I already have no hope at all in Bethesda's own franchises so if they consistently fuck up with their subsidiary works I'm gonna be pissed
[4:22:22] <KeiPrime> thats it
[4:22:26] <GenericTwitchAcc1> MASS YEET
[4:22:29] <otakon17> @AncelDeLambert it did some damage to him

[4:22:49] <prophetdisharmonious> why does the sound from moving the skill point sound like someones trying to contact snake via codec?
[4:22:54] <Jam29Josh> Nice to see that there's an industry that's finally casting gingers as hero's rather than the annoying bully characters they're typically cast as
[4:23:02] <ArtooKilledYou> If it’s not on two legs, it’s a dog
[4:23:04] <%Finakala> Does that count as eating shit on sliding
[4:23:07] <otakon17> he ALMOST ate shit there

[4:23:25] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @Jam29Josh Gingers are very versatile folk. They have to be in order to gain more Souls
[4:23:26] <%joylent_blue> feces almost ingested
[4:23:26] <%AncelDeLambert> this game sucks, it has no visceral punishment for ramming into crap
[4:23:27] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Ah yes. Ron Weasly. The bully
[4:23:34] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @ArtooKilledYou If it is on two legs, it's a featherless bird.

[4:24:06] <Gorgen> do you customize your character in the beginning of the game?

[4:25:50] <otakon17> you need Force PULL it seems
[4:25:50] <%AncelDeLambert> WHY ARE THESE JEDI MAGGOTS BREATHING MY AIR!?!

[4:26:54] <GenericTwitchAcc1> LUL
[4:26:54] <%v1Ables> @King_Wolf_Rigger basic grunt soldiers were still clones, but freom different strains. Officers were actual people

[4:28:07] <%BlackJack607> You guys remember vine?
[4:28:07] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @v1Ables Not from what I've seen. The Emperor hated the clones, and once order 66 was completed, he booted them out and had straglers killed. Filled the ranks with regular folks.

[4:29:14] <$Taisuru> OH
[4:29:15] <+Punchasaur> They know what Jedi are but don’t know any of their abilities?
[4:29:15] <%supersugoisenpai1> Wait wut?
[4:29:16] <Wan6Saber> Pat has a soul, unlike HJTenchi
[4:29:20] <+heartbbyy> The Force Unleashed was a sekiro clone too ohnKazpa
[4:29:26] <%v1Ables> @King_Wolf_Rigger depends on where we get our info, Im mainly refering to the explanation given in the second Battlefront game. But I guess if youre going off of actual cannon from the jedi Rebels tv show then yea your right
[4:29:27] <%ultimatetotoro> FROM MY POINT OF VIEW IT IS THE JEDI WHO ARE EVIL
[4:29:29] <subjectg> “If I don’t see them they can’t see me.”
[4:29:31] <%xvalltendo> any Wilhelm screams yet?
[4:29:32] <+Punchasaur> Oh...YOU
[4:29:39] <triangularblasphemy> Yknow just saying, I think these Stormtroopers are much more relatable than the MC
[4:29:39] <%GraceTBM> more like they didn't believe that they were so supernatural probably
[4:29:39] <mankeyfigh> You should quit

[4:29:55] <triangularblasphemy> Listen to their lines!
[4:29:57] <Manjove> they sound SCARED of you
[4:29:58] <Dutchpotato> I like that this game has an in universe excuse for bad stormtooper ai OpieOP
[4:30:01] <%AncelDeLambert> these guys need to realize what level they're on
[4:30:01] <%SWFanatic> big nope
[4:30:02] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> so how many orphans did you make today?
[4:30:03] <ittla> @AngriestPat are you enjoying your star war
[4:30:04] <$Taisuru> Game does not look like it has the difficulty of a Souls game (Which is fine)
[4:30:07] <SpaceGuntank> they talk so big for cannon fodder LUL
[4:30:08] <+Arsimckhoi> I like the jojo sound design during that moment
[4:30:10] <%GraceTBM> I wish a game like Fallout would have these situational loud combat barks

[4:30:23] <MoulesFritz> @Taisuru pat has it on normal mode
[4:30:24] <NeroInfinite> nice
[4:30:26] <collind99> The sweep and stab down move is the best @angriestpat
[4:30:27] <triangularblasphemy> One of the stormtroopers even says "I knew I would go out like this..."
[4:30:27] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> llol
[4:30:28] <%GarbageQueenEllie> that looks tricky
[4:30:28] <MoulesFritz> hard is the sekiro mode
[4:30:29] <CrypticMochi> I want to see one just book it out of there
[4:30:29] <+EmotionalFatGuy> Is jar jar in this?
[4:30:30] <mankeyfigh> I FEEL GREAT I CAN DO THIS I CAN WIN YES YES YES
[4:30:30] <triangularblasphemy> Like FUCK
[4:30:30] <Tedious_Tickles> well he is playing on a lower difficulty than the hardest
[4:30:31] <%realm_forge> “I’ve got this” lol
[4:30:31] <Wan6Saber> kek
[4:30:35] <%SWFanatic> dig up
[4:30:37] <%GraceTBM> this whole game seems a lot like sekiro actually
[4:30:39] <Monkeyweed21> the door pat
[4:30:42] <+Punchasaur> FROM MY PERSONAL PERSPECTIVE THE JEDI ARE THE ONES COMMITTING IMMORAL ACTS
[4:30:42] <collind99> Pat turn around
[4:30:47] <FunkyStreams> you can do it rickety legs!
[4:30:56] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @v1Ables Oh man, yeah. I completely forgot about that game. Man, kinda sucks when lore gets all loopy like that. That would explain some things about the original trilogy though. Thanks for reminding me about that.
[4:30:58] <TheMorilo> "Pat stares at" except he doesn't
[4:31:02] <Tedious_Tickles> I see more similarities to Witcher 3 combat than Sekiro
[4:31:02] <collind99> Go towards the meditation point in that area
[4:31:04] <triangularblasphemy> Light side demands more stormtrooper kill
[4:31:05] <$Taisuru> @MoulesFritz Normal mode is the way all games should be viewed initially, if you're expected to play on a harder difficulty then they don't know what Normal means
[4:31:08] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @Punchasaur said Anakin moments after killing toddlers
[4:31:09] <triangularblasphemy> Its the only way to get stronger
[4:31:11] <Hellarussian> he said halt
[4:31:14] <%Finakala> Just because he stares at something doesn't mean he sees it
[4:31:15] <%GarbageQueenEllie> If Pat's a droid, do you think Matt would be an Imperial?
[4:31:17] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat, you have a map
[4:31:18] <Fryclan> at-st
[4:31:20] <KeiPrime> no ice caves? shame
[4:31:21] <AncyentMarinere> How long you been playing Pat
[4:31:23] <%SvenHolgersson> So on a scale of Holiday Special to Genndy's Clone Wars how good is this game @AngriestPat
[4:31:25] <%SWFanatic> I CLAPPED
[4:31:26] <MoulesFritz> @Taisuru sure, but you also shouldn't expect Normal to be Dark Souls
[4:31:28] <Fryclan> atstatstatstatstatstatstatstatstatstatstatst
[4:31:31] <%SWFanatic> They broke new ground!
[4:31:34] <+Punchasaur> @sphincter_spelunker they were evil toddlers

[4:32:24] <%GraceTBM> i wish it's blaster bolts were wider
[4:32:28] <collind99> Attack it’s legs with your lightsaber you deal a ton of damage @angriestpat
[4:32:28] <MoulesFritz> mass push can push big boys

[4:32:57] <dekkitout> @GarbageQueenEllie That's cause Starkiller would pretzel the legs like a true Force-Chad Kappa
[4:32:58] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Amazing

[4:33:33] <MoulesFritz> why doesn't the empire just blow up your ship
[4:33:34] <%PauliusMaximus> really could have used a ludicous ammount of quicktime events LUL
[4:33:38] <%Finakala> This guy just took out my tank, better shoot him on foot
[4:33:41] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> she got crazy eyes
[4:33:45] <%GarbageQueenEllie> The Jedi prolly murdered them all
[4:33:46] <dekkitout> Another one of those civilizations, huh...
[4:33:47] <MoulesFritz> kasheeeeeek
[4:33:49] <%AncelDeLambert> this writing ain't good, man
[4:33:49] <Moonlight_Grimoire> holy cow Cere is just Pockets
[4:33:49] <%PROUD2beGINGER> I was gonna say, the guy inside didn't die
[4:33:51] <+Punchasaur> It’s really impractical of the empire to build tanks that can easily be tripped
[4:33:54] <MasterDecoder> Tarfull?!
[4:33:55] <Tedious_Tickles> I feel like any minute this woman is gonna shoot her eyeballs straight out her sockets
[4:33:57] <prophetdisharmonious> Wow, an ancient race of force users? That's never EVER been done before.
[4:34:01] <%JJCheeker> She looks like a skeleton with big eyeballs
[4:34:01] <%honeyman18> I like his jacket
[4:34:02] <trianglehat> space pat hates it
[4:34:06] <GenericTwitchAcc1> I hate all these characters :)
[4:34:10] <%Anime_Flux> Why does this captain put up with their shit exactly?
[4:34:13] <Admiral_PopnFresh> this dialogue is terrible
[4:34:14] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Nevermind she's not Lamar, she's Dex from saints row
[4:34:17] <MoulesFritz> his goofy tunic looks like shit
[4:34:17] <triangularblasphemy> Lady he killed a tank. Yeah, he's gonna be cocky as shit
[4:34:18] <collind99> @angriestpat I recommend going to Dathomir next
[4:34:19] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @GenericTwitchAcc1 Oh wow, do tell
[4:34:20] <%SWFanatic> My ponchos showing some wear.
[4:34:22] <mankeyfigh> FIGHT FOREVER
[4:34:23] <FunkyStreams> "you got any suncreen on ya?"
[4:34:24] <ThornJay> this dialog feels so wooden
[4:34:26] <SpellCatty> The MC looks like he's one of Ron Weasly's brothers
[4:34:30] <%SWFanatic> I better craft a new poncho.
[4:34:30] <%realm_forge> The empire fucked kysheek up royally
[4:34:31] <prophetdisharmonious> also that chick looks like she's about to break out and sing purple rain
[4:34:33] <DisGuyOvahEre> how did this guy even survive order 66
[4:34:33] <%derap41> pop you eyes back in dammit
[4:34:33] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @Finakala Reminds me of Fist of the North Star, where after the dude walks through a collapsing sky-scraper, somebody picks a fight with him.
[4:34:39] <+TheBitingIrish> Anyone else tired of voice actors also doing their own mo-cap?
[4:34:40] <+ktfright> Wow Debra Wilson from MadTV
[4:34:40] <%GraceTBM> "rather not talk about it" makes for a really dull protagonist
[4:34:41] <Monkeyweed21> IT MADE MY EYES HUGHE
[4:34:42] <triangularblasphemy> Most people don't singlehandedly kill Abrahms battle tanks
[4:34:42] <+Bipolarhernandez> YOUNGLINGS
[4:34:46] <trianglehat> oh no not the younglings
[4:34:46] <DatAsuna> Pat is cuddling his own youngling
[4:34:46] <reonome> did he kill the younglings
[4:34:52] <GenericTwitchAcc1> PogChamp is this a The Purge franchise spinoff?
[4:34:52] <%AnIrishPapaya> Not the younglings
[4:34:54] <Dr_Mooose> oh no
[4:34:54] <%arancet> god i hate the younglings

[4:35:09] <bluescreen1988> gee i wonder who the mysterious lady is
[4:35:09] <%GraceTBM> this is the lady version of that Mr Robot guy
[4:35:09] <TonyPullMyDTRedgrave> THE YOUNGLINGS D:
[4:35:20] <+KingOfTheFist> Why do they insist on calling them younglings, makes them sound like animals
[4:35:20] <DisGuyOvahEre> PrisON?
[4:35:22] <%Typhaeon> @GraceTBM Pepe Maliq Kappa
[4:35:23] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> AHHH character spoilers!

[4:35:34] <%mh9s> his hair is buggin out a bit
[4:35:35] <+Punchasaur> Torture? Yuck!
[4:35:36] <%honeyman18> Cause child Murder sounds bad I guess
[4:35:39] <Monkeyweed21> MY EYES ARE HUGE
[4:35:40] <SolverCODO> She's SEEN THINGS
[4:35:44] <MoulesFritz> why doesn't the empire just blow up your ship
[4:35:45] <+quinnage7> @collind99 dude its kind of obvious
[4:35:46] <prophetdisharmonious> She's a sith now
[4:35:47] <GenericTwitchAcc1> she a Sith now
[4:35:47] <Hellarussian> she super did I bet
[4:35:48] <otakon17> SO who wants to bet Trilla is the Second Sister?
[4:35:48] <Dehlome> definitely a sith
[4:35:48] <reonome> its the sith lady
[4:35:50] <dekkitout> Oh GOD DAMMIT...
[4:35:50] <transporterthesequel> Padawan is 100% the Second Sister
[4:35:50] <DatAsuna> "from a certain point of view" bullshit
[4:35:52] <Zudrag> she did and now she's super evil i bet
[4:35:52] <%chaumiester> She got the force tortured out of her....?
[4:35:53] <%SWFanatic> whatever you say Kreia
[4:35:53] <+heartbbyy> @KingOfTheFist I SLAUGHTERED THEM LIKE ANIMALS
[4:35:54] <ha2ken> She's the 2nd sister I bet
[4:35:55] <%honeyman18> I mean Darth Vader iced a planet so that seems worse?
[4:35:55] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Trilla is the Sister now
[4:35:56] <+mugwugsampoo> Kappa
[4:35:57] <%ShichiNoBushi> I bet she's Second Sister.
[4:35:57] <%BlackJack607> She second sister now
[4:35:58] <Idon__> [THAT'S ROUGH] "no"
[4:35:58] <Dutchpotato> I feel like she made a deal
[4:35:58] <$Taisuru> BIG Sith
[4:35:59] <energywarning> why would you keep that information from us?
[4:35:59] <MoulesFritz> why doesn't the empire just blow up your ship?
[4:36:00] <+Reizie_Etherealm> So you didn't want to turn to hatred and become a sith so you just gave up the force instead, that's a good alternative
[4:36:01] <%Rumbutt> Her Padawan is almost definitely Second Sister
[4:36:01] <cowardlord> Bet she's evil
[4:36:02] <SchroedingersFerret> Padowan is the inquisitor
[4:36:02] <otakon17> I'm SORRY GAME
[4:36:02] <%xtremegamer80> Oh Trilla must've been turned into an Inquisitor
[4:36:02] <Hellarussian> oh
[4:36:03] <%derap41> So she is Pockets
[4:36:04] <zipfile777> POP
[4:36:04] <DisGuyOvahEre> jedi younglings: gotta murder. black wamen? nah just send them to jedi jail
[4:36:04] <thetruenicster> She's the Second Sister Isn't She
[4:36:04] <FunkyStreams> When do you get to play as Cpt. Price?
[4:36:04] <dekkitout> Please don't Obi Wan it up, lady

[4:36:11] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> "Pat, I am your sister!"
[4:36:11] <trianglehat> sith ghost
[4:36:12] <Moonlight_Grimoire> She's the ghost of Pocket's, Pat
[4:36:20] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Oh god, I hate that idea. "They are dead now because they are not good anymore" fuck right off.
[4:36:21] <%PauliusMaximus> she is new Kreia
[4:36:26] <MoulesFritz> why doesn't the empire just blow up your ship, tho
[4:36:26] <otakon17> time to level up!
[4:36:27] <%a_lucky_soul> plant your seed patrick
[4:36:27] <%GraceTBM> this is a really weird lady for a star wars game but honestly it's kinda refreshing to have a weirdo normal human running around
[4:36:28] <DatAsuna> Don't even bother touching your saber
[4:36:28] <subjectg> now where have i seen this before...
[4:36:31] <%Finakala> Sherlock Holmes Watson.ogg
[4:36:33] <DatAsuna> just go to bogano then do it later
[4:36:34] <+mgskomododragon> All i can see with the backpack bot is Ratchet and Clank
[4:36:34] <mankeyfigh> OOH PRETTY FLOWERS
[4:36:35] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @King_Wolf_Rigger Maybe she doesn't know
[4:36:36] <nobody12349> SlKE HER PADWAN'S GONNA BE THE BIG MONSTER 100%
[4:36:42] <%Typhaeon> Diet Kreia, now with half the depth
[4:36:45] <%v1Ables> WATCH THE DROID ALSO BE IN ON IT
[4:36:46] <+Punchasaur> Hello my name is pockets here are my eyes 👁👁
[4:36:46] <%realm_forge> Plant some dank force herb
[4:36:47] <%SWFanatic> Delay Thrust lets you last another minute in bed
[4:36:48] <%xtremegamer80> @AngriestPat Sith and Inquisitors are not really the same thing. They don't kill the masters.
[4:36:51] <Tedious_Tickles> More force yeet
[4:36:58] <$Taisuru> BIG Force
[4:36:58] <teamjflight> padawan definitely the villain
[4:37:01] <MoulesFritz> excited for the game to end with vader ganking you and you die
[4:37:05] <%joylent_blue> man when are we gonna see Second Sister again
[4:37:06] <otakon17> I'd take more life myself
[4:37:07] <dekkitout> Kreia, but without summon-sword lightsabers PunOko
[4:37:07] <DatAsuna> Always buy moves before health
[4:37:09] <prophetdisharmonious> But what about the droid attack on the wookies?
[4:37:09] <%xtremegamer80> Man I hope we can learn more about Inquisitors in this game
[4:37:13] <DatAsuna> Health is the brad shoemaker move
[4:37:16] <DatAsuna> the move of SCRUBS
[4:37:19] <%GraceTBM> @MoulesFritz "Die for the canon"
[4:37:20] <collind99> Delay thrust is good
[4:37:21] <%SWFanatic> seed
[4:37:22] <%AnIrishPapaya> Is there a force lightsaber throw in this?
[4:37:22] <%animalxer> check out your new lightsaber parts
[4:37:23] <Dwarven_Gaming> you had 2 points didnt you?
[4:37:25] <%animalxer> and your plants
[4:37:27] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @GarbageQueenEllie Yeah, your right. I hope. I just never liked that excuse given by Yoda and Kenobi.
[4:37:27] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> @xtremegamer80 what's stopping them from killing their master?
[4:37:29] <DatAsuna> :P
[4:37:29] <Jam29Josh> did you get the double bladed lightsaber?
[4:37:30] <Monkeyweed21> plant some seeds and mod your saber
[4:37:32] <DisGuyOvahEre> remember when vader was completely blood thirsty between 3 and 4 and would go out of his way to hunt jedi even if it was just a rumor from a fringe patrol? nah lets just let this one jedi go
[4:37:37] <nobody12349> "And that padwan's name? Patrick Boiven."
[4:37:37] <%joylent_blue> whenever Second Sister isn't on screen, everyone should be asking, where's Second Sister!?!
[4:37:42] <mankeyfigh> No lightsaber upgrades
[4:37:42] <Bigbossman91> @AnIrishPapaya yes there is
[4:37:43] <collind99> Lightsaber customization tho
[4:37:44] <Dehlome> habeeb it
[4:37:46] <Monkeyweed21> dattebayo
[4:37:47] <+joekuta71> Dattebayo
[4:37:48] <%derap41> DATEBAYO
[4:37:48] <%ShichiNoBushi> Believe it!
[4:37:48] <%xtremegamer80> @ThatOneGuyYouSaw They just don't, Inquisitors act more like a group than Sith.
[4:37:50] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @King_Wolf_Rigger I think it's more like, "I don't even know you anymore"
[4:37:51] <$Taisuru> Stop saying youngling
[4:37:52] <%GraceTBM> yeah throw lightsaber seems like a slam dunk, i'd be super disappointed if there isn't one
[4:37:55] <%AnIrishPapaya> Awesome
[4:37:55] <DatAsuna> dancing cal
[4:37:55] <%Bt_Robot> Daddy bye-O
[4:37:58] <%joylent_blue> i hate him
[4:37:59] <thetruenicster> Your Nindo
[4:38:01] <%SWFanatic> it makes your eyeballs grow up
[4:38:02] <DisGuyOvahEre> @Taisuru ok oldling
[4:38:04] <prophetdisharmonious> remember when Vader had an evil assassin version of R2D2 and C3PO?
[4:38:06] <DatAsuna> cal has terrible posture
[4:38:10] <%honeyman18> Ever since I was a kidnapped child slave to the jedi order.
[4:38:10] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Ready to respawn at the nearest checkpoint lol
[4:38:13] <+Punchasaur> Naruto jewtsu
[4:38:13] <FunkyStreams> you guys growin some shroom bruh?
[4:38:20] <TonyPullMyDTRedgrave> Lmfao the head tracking through that was uhh something
[4:38:22] <%AnIrishPapaya> Loved doing the lightsaber throw in Jedi Outcast
[4:38:23] <%mckraven> just say kid
[4:38:25] <ittla> Light Saber.
[4:38:28] <Jam29Josh> @angriestpat If you go to Dathomir you can get a double bladed lightsaber upgrade
[4:38:31] <DatAsuna> ugly
[4:38:36] <ittla> Death Starrrrrrr
[4:38:37] <%GraceTBM> i wish these had stats
[4:38:37] <KeiPrime> the dog chewed on the bottom of it look kinda bugs me
[4:38:40] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> @xtremegamer80 they managed to create a dark side faction that's not full of selfish pricks? incredible
[4:38:44] <%joylent_blue> Jam29Josh dude why would you tell him that
[4:38:51] <KeiPrime> that emitter sucks tho
[4:38:59] <+Ell1ot> is this purely cosmetic or are these upgrades?
[4:39:00] <%joylent_blue> let him find stuff on his own
[4:39:01] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Durasteel is a pretty good material
[4:39:01] <otakon17> I still like the classic Emitter
[4:39:02] <%Typhaeon> That's pretty lookin
[4:39:05] <TonyPullMyDTRedgrave> do the new parts actually affect damage or stat output or is it purely aesthetic?
[4:39:06] <beetbo2> looks like a hunk of shit, i love it
[4:39:07] <%GraceTBM> or it would be cool if they had bonuses like deflection window or something
[4:39:08] <%SvenHolgersson> gottem
[4:39:08] <subjectg> mods not doing their jobs, woohoo
[4:39:09] <%xtremegamer80> @ThatOneGuyYouSaw Oh they are selfish pricks, but they just don't work together.

[4:39:23] <%realm_forge> Where are you seeing the benefits?
[4:39:24] <%AnIcedCoffee> @ThatOneGuyYouSaw the inquisitors answer to Vader, he's scarred them all in some way so they're scared of him
[4:39:25] <$Taisuru> @DisGuyOvahEre That slayed me, gj
[4:39:26] <prophetdisharmonious> Looks good besides the torn cloth
[4:39:27] <CSharkpunk> What is that sound it doesn't even sound like a lightsaber
[4:39:30] <DisGuyOvahEre> ginger lightsaber
[4:39:32] <DatAsuna> I love orange sabers, it just sucks when you also have orange hair
[4:39:32] <%honeyman18> The bottom part broke off in your ass
[4:39:34] <+Ell1ot> i think Elmo was chewing on it
[4:39:35] <%xtremegamer80> @AngriestPat Hey, how do you like your Ginger-saber?
[4:39:35] <mankeyfigh> Oh that’s cool
[4:39:38] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @GarbageQueenEllie Oh for sure, but the way said it, and acted like Luke was a weirdo for being emotional about it? I get not wanting to tell the kid, but when he finds out, you lay it down straight. Not just shrug and wave it off, you know what I mean?
[4:39:39] <Monkeyweed21> DISGUSTING GINGER SABER
[4:39:43] <%GraceTBM> or you attach a GUN to the bottom!

[4:40:16] <+Punchasaur> Matching your lightsaber with your hair is a dumb Woolie move
[4:40:17] <prophetdisharmonious> When are we just going to see a memory of his old master just telling him to remember to press the second button to unleash the double sided lightsaber?
[4:40:19] <%Finakala> Does look pretty neat

[4:41:02] <%SWFanatic> <3 MercyWing1 apatWink MercyWing2 <3
[4:41:07] <%ShichiNoBushi> So precious you should put him on a ring.
[4:41:11] <%derap41> its not a tumma
[4:41:12] <%GraceTBM> It would have made more sense to me if death stranding was 20 to 30 hours and outer worlds was 65
[4:41:12] <%JJCheeker> enbSwoleL apatWink enbSwoleR
[4:41:15] <+Zeghart> @joylent_blue Thank you, it's a really difficult time

[4:44:25] <%rumtumtugnutz> best Monster is Zero Ultra Sunrise
[4:44:30] <mostundesired> Fell back fuck asleep Paige.
[4:44:31] <%GraceTBM> or she fell down the stairs
[4:44:36] <%joylent_blue> that's understandable AND relatable
[4:44:37] <+rdark_ksu> I always assumed Paige straight up hibernated

[4:46:17] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Always kill Rosh
[4:46:22] <MasterDecoder> Pay me in entertainment @AngriestPat
[4:46:26] <%derap41> Plague is complaining about having to climb shit
[4:46:37] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> Pat is racist against black dragons, confirmed.
[4:46:38] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> They fuckin better! Gimme some goddam Fatalis!

[4:47:08] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Looked it up, the lady is Debra Wilson from MADtv
[4:47:28] <%Zeghart> apatWink apatBlep apatWink
[4:47:28] <%GarbageQueenEllie> How about Saber and smol saber?
[4:47:30] <%AncelDeLambert> it's the same fecking thing, frankly
[4:47:30] <%BoboDaHobo> BoboDaHobo subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 16 months! Hey Pat, work has been soul crushing recently, thanks for all the streams. Also, cat update: he's an asshole that's eating all of my erasers but I still love him I guess.
[4:47:32] <Tedious_Tickles> What about two dual light sabers
[4:47:34] <izaich> what about lightsaber nunchuks?
[4:47:41] <%mh9s> light hammer
[4:47:46] <NeroInfinite> There are bigger lightsaber pat
[4:47:47] <%AncelDeLambert> there is no nodachi lightsaber and SHAME ON THE UNIVERSE FOR THAT!
[4:47:48] <%ShichiNoBushi> Double weapons usually counted as using a light weapon for off-hand attacks.
[4:47:49] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @GarbageQueenEllie They are adorable, and must be protected.
[4:47:56] <nobody12349> There's giant light clubs Pat
[4:47:57] <%GraceTBM> i way preferred having two super upgrade juiced blades than just a two blade
[4:47:58] <%Bt_Robot> Dark Saber has weight
[4:47:58] <robwob2016> The big ones are called Great Lightsabers
[4:48:01] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @King_Wolf_Rigger Agreed
[4:48:02] <%joylent_blue> lightsaber nunchuks sound like a problem
[4:48:02] <ScreamLord> Light Whips are probably the coolest dumb weapons in Star Wars
[4:48:06] <northsouthmiddledakota> sometimes they have, they never manage too confirm that
[4:48:11] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> why haven't they ever made a shield?
[4:48:13] <nobody12349> Also Lightapears
[4:48:14] <+Winnosh> Sword chucks Yo!
[4:48:17] <%AncelDeLambert> frankly... it's good that the EU died
[4:48:18] <%rumtumtugnutz> Bobo the Hobo sounds like you're making fun of italian people
[4:48:19] <%GraceTBM> seems like a lightsaber dagger would be the most efficient
[4:48:25] <NeroInfinite> "FUCKK THISS"
[4:48:25] <%WackyGear> @AngriestPat I think there are some lightsaber that can change the length of their beam
[4:48:26] <%SWFanatic> Good stream Pat.
[4:48:27] <indigobat91> tonfa lightsabres for the win yo
[4:48:27] <Tedious_Tickles> Shields are for cowards
[4:48:32] <Dr_Mooose> oh my god, I just realized I bought a something at the store and left it in the cart when I left.
[4:48:33] <+Diamond_Dynamo> Cya

[4:48:39] <%BoboDaHobo> @rumtumtugnutz how so?

[4:48:40] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> butt dual wielding is impractical and dumberer
[4:48:41] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> there were lightshields, or something like that I think
