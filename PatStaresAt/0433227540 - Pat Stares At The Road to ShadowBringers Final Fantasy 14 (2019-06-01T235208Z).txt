[0:14:43] <%Kirijuo> Pat why does this game have such a good macro system
[0:14:44] <Xelhesia> @Nanomachiner maybe but its gonna be tough
[0:14:44] <%vaporousTippler> It's called FFXII.

[0:14:54] <@JustinianKnight> not really yet
[0:14:59] <+Deosier> would I miss much if i skip all the scenes so i can catch up
[0:15:03] <DetroitSentai> trusts are the solution soon
[0:15:04] <@SSaryn> And also can't progress through main story otherwise

[0:15:22] <Louie_Salmon> I hate people
[0:15:22] <%valkuma> ITS AN MMO why would you complain about social interaction
[0:15:23] <Sloavon> ANGERY
[0:15:26] <Angry_Ev1L> I don't Kappa TALKING lmao
[0:15:27] <%Divryne> FFXIV is a FF game first MMO second, but it's still an MMO.
[0:15:32] <@JustinianKnight> Hello it is I
[0:15:33] <%AppleBasket> ANGER
[0:15:35] <%valkuma> De-socialization of MMO's is why Classic WoW is making a comeback
[0:15:36] <+VashyronM> But the community is pretty good for the most part. So, don't be too scared.
[0:15:36] <+arbiduck> @Deosier Skipping the story kinda defeats the point, everything in the game is gated by it and has to do with it
[0:15:37] <fearhurst> Ever wonder whether the next fantasy will be the final?
[0:15:41] <hntronium> What a weeb
[0:15:41] <BappoSama> NINJA1
[0:15:41] <@CreepyPorpoise> HM.
[0:15:44] <Kongro_> Once FF14 is dying or lost most of it's playerbase the game'll be a lot more singleplayer friendly.
[0:15:45] <+Deosier> figured. ehhh I'll do it slow as quick as possible.
[0:15:45] <Tucker0603> trying to find Pat to meme him
[0:15:45] <%DXLelouch24> Remember

[0:18:29] <%Svanyr> Yeeeup
[0:18:29] <Xelhesia> orbonne monastery can get really bad
[0:18:30] <+Xalgar> Heavensward was godlike (unless you were a Bard main LUL )
[0:18:30] <ColRedyx> An MMO sub really isn't that much when you think of it per hour instead of per game. 1 new game = 4 months of an MMO.
[0:18:30] <%Arnschen> It hurt
[0:18:30] <@SSaryn> Oh ok yeah.
[0:18:30] <+Silent_Sheep> weeping city is great
[0:18:32] <%MegboyManuel> Niddhogg bridge is the greatest story moment.
[0:18:35] <snowmanse> Bad Orbonne just gives you more of Cid's amazing dialogue
[0:18:36] <%QuadraticGravity> Orbonne is fucking fun though
[0:18:40] <%rumtumtugnutz> @BappoSama As in toward the heavens
[0:18:41] <%Fidel_Castbro> But even a bad Orbonne has Thunder King
[0:18:45] <Tucker0603> I want that fending gear from weeping city
[0:18:46] <%Svanyr> Better go place the shadow orbs right next to other ones
[0:18:47] <chris_babaganoosh05> I've seen entire alliances wipe on the first trash pull of Labyrinth of the Ancients. Literally HOW
[0:18:48] <Dastardry> Jokes on you I almost wiped on Mustardio and wiped on Agrias today.

[0:19:02] <Neoripo> Cid is great, not so much when people don't know how to DPS
[0:19:02] <%Arnschen> It's always Thunder King
[0:19:05] <+Vijuani> @AngriestPat transferred from JP to NA servers recently, how come you guys are trash?
[0:19:07] <%apostateCourier> Thunder God*

[0:19:50] <+Xalgar> Healers in Heavensward = PogChamp , Healers in Shadowbringers = ResidentSleeper
[0:19:50] <expressnode> Sony doesn't agree
[0:19:51] <%terminallyCapriciousz> DISAGREE
[0:19:52] <+Kise77> @AngriestPat Have you read the threads about MCH issues in 5.0?

[0:20:00] <Angry_Ev1L> You can put HUGE fucking hat there too
[0:20:00] <ShichiNoBushi> "Big anime titties are good." -Pat
[0:20:01] <JWright2396> Sony didn't like that
[0:20:03] <%jerree66> Noice
[0:20:03] <%ThatOneGameTester> Big ole sweater cows
[0:20:04] <%QueequegTheater> tiny hats > big tiddy

[0:20:16] <@mothmandraws> this crafting system is actually kinda fun
[0:20:16] <%jessedouglas> I just got here... I have many questions
[0:20:17] <Xelhesia> ive been barding since 2.0 launch and im still excited for bard in SHB
[0:20:18] <ColRedyx> @Lapinelis Well yeah up front, but if you play at least 15 hours a month that's $1 an hour which is good value. FF14 is only $13/mo anyway.
[0:20:18] <zecht89> Dark Knight, The Cuttest of Corners

[0:20:30] <%Reanimator83> I heard titties. What’s going on
[0:20:31] <@SSaryn> Probably better on PS4 Pro but yeah, as long as you have a stable connection.
[0:20:33] <ShichiNoBushi> Put a tiny hat directly on the anime titties.
[0:20:34] <Tucker0603> my leader of my FC is on PS4

[0:21:11] <%CitrusDrink> He's a damn dirty potato is what he is
[0:21:14] <%IMDRanged> Was he the one clawing his face?
[0:21:16] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Oh I see
[0:21:16] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> theres like 3 documentaries about how great he is

[0:21:30] <LegendGHT> @angriestpat best way to get through pre-expansion updates fast?
[0:21:30] <ShichiNoBushi> Not this chat. The other chat.
[0:21:33] <Angry_Ev1L> SHOW THE HYPE shit
[0:21:34] <snowmanse> Could we get his pouty face from when the audio was having issues?
[0:21:36] <%Bane_Kaikyo> a silly chat-blocking suare of Yoshi-face

[0:22:42] <BunnyEmperor> The Minstrel's Ballad: The Weapon's Refrain (Ultimate)
[0:22:49] <Bailey__gaming> Oh @angriestpat have you decided what the E3 stuff will be?
[0:22:49] <Xelhesia> me and my group have wiped 392 times on UwU
[0:22:51] <$SleepyMaribo> @gespenst25 Ultima Weapon Ultimate, hardest optional fight in the game.
[0:22:54] <%QueequegTheater> Is that a solo thing? Is that why the clear rate is so low
[0:22:56] <+fatal_penguin_> Pat, the Lone Wolf
[0:23:00] <%drabberfaun535> !uptime
[0:23:01] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 23m 2s.
[0:23:01] <garbageheaphound> Pat is made for Loneliness
[0:23:03] <%ElenaManetta> yourself and 1000+ viewers
[0:23:03] <%MegboyManuel> Pat is good at single player life
[0:23:05] <DetroitSentai> 8 man raid
[0:23:05] <CopperTucker> I do a ton of cons, I cope with just taking time to recharge
[0:23:08] <helpmeimafruit> is there any reason not to POTD all the way to 60
[0:23:08] <PowerWeightedCell> @kujofire990 just wait for 54, fell cleave changes things so much
[0:23:10] <%spiritofmojave> @queequegtheater no still 8 man raid
[0:23:14] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> It's a 8 person thing, whch arguably makes it harder
[0:23:17] <+MeatBomb> Is this the newbie helper stream?
[0:23:19] <+phamchri> @wackygear buy it off square
[0:23:22] <GarbageQueenEllie> Do you prefer Single-Players or MMO's overall?
[0:23:25] <%QueequegTheater> Holy hell
[0:23:28] <garbageheaphound> So madmen
[0:23:28] <haveswordmuststing> so i just farmed Meridium for 7 hours, i now have enough for a mount and watched all of Phantom blood
[0:23:29] <+Xalgar> Soloing in an MMO ResidentSleeper
[0:23:30] <theobble> Time to make my appearance. I'm on my way.
[0:23:30] <nsDrummer> ultimate is the hardest raid imaginable
[0:23:31] <+Bad1uck> @WackyGear If you buy off of steam you MUST buy every other chunk of content via steam too
[0:23:33] <+thundiedramon> it's basically for the 1% of raiders
[0:23:38] <%blinkinthedark> blinkinthedark subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months! Just started FFXIV now. Thanks for finally putting me on after many years of hearing you talk about it
[0:23:38] <%NovraSplice> No worries duder! I know i'll be grand :D Games always help
[0:23:39] <%QueequegTheater> Sounds like fighting Midir with Skyrim controls
[0:23:41] <$SleepyMaribo> i think gold bahumet has a higher clear rate then UwU
[0:23:53] <SailingSaturn> We're getting more Ultimates in 5.X patches I think cirThink
[0:23:53] <LegendGHT> so if I sub... he'll read my comment lol
[0:23:54] <+fatal_penguin_> The bebe is sleeping?
[0:23:56] <%MegboyManuel> Elmo is timed???
[0:23:59] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> Bahamut probably has a higher clear rate because its been around longer
[0:23:59] <ColRedyx> @QueequegTheater It's a raid that's harder than anything in WoW. It took the world first group 10 days to clear the first one, and it's just one boss that you need to already be BiS to stand a chance against.

[0:30:47] <Mexrage> why is the reason so many are going DRG? they don't seem to have any significant changes for shadowbrinber
[0:30:47] <+iwasJase> that's fair
[0:30:49] <Xelhesia> i picked archer and never looked back up. samurai is my secondary and warrior is my tertiary

[0:33:38] <%QueequegTheater> Is there an auto-lockon? I feel like I'm not contributing enough to dungeons because it takes me several seconds to lock on after killing an enemy
[0:33:38] <%AquilaHarukaze> I've gone so far as to using this hotbar simulator thing to figure out how my hotbar is going to look like the moment GNB is out. I can't be more ready

[0:34:53] <+VashyronM> why no dragoon?
[0:34:54] <%VanaSkiller> yes
[0:34:56] <@mothmandraws> Pat should have sat at the ampitheatre
[0:34:58] <+Xalgar> I remember almost getting kicked out of the Stormfeelers for making creepy sex noises with my Lalafell LUL
[0:34:59] <haveswordmuststing> or Jojo
[0:35:02] <%Ner234> LUL
[0:35:03] <$valriot> ...No scarfD
[0:35:03] <@mothmandraws> so he could be on stage for his ted talk

[0:35:09] <BunnyEmperor> He just doesn't have the Soul of the Dragon equipped.... I hope LUL
[0:35:10] <+metalsiren31> PREENG
[0:35:15] <Thalchampz> LUL
[0:35:23] <%DavidSanChan> I'm gonna PING
[0:35:25] <HeadsHeldHigh> LUL DPS problems
[0:35:25] <DefaultSettiings> but FFXIV is pornography
[0:35:26] <%CitrusDrink> Oh dang that's pretty useful actually
[0:35:28] <contrope> You don't wait when you play non dps
[0:35:29] <+iwasJase> I have that on when I'm semi-afk fishing while watching something else on my other monitor. That and my controller vibrates if a fish bites too.
[0:35:31] <@SpaceCaptainCrone> Tanks might be waiting around at the beginning of Shadowbringers
[0:35:31] <%LegendGHT> who all are stormfeelers here anyway
[0:35:33] <indig0bird> I was today years old...
[0:35:33] <%BlitzNeidhart> DPS do watch more porn after all
[0:35:37] <%QueequegTheater> tfw you DPS on offpeak hours
[0:35:38] <%QuadraticGravity> Turn on SFX for alt tab fishing
[0:35:38] <Zix_Serro> "Pornography is extremely useful" -Pat Boivin 2019
[0:35:38] <Saltmeisterr> is lancer one of starting classes?
[0:35:40] <griffemto> lvl 64 LNC majinoWeebey1 majinoWeebey2
[0:35:42] <%Bane_Kaikyo> porn useful for dps... got it
[0:35:48] <Tucker0603> IVE DONE SOMETHING GREAT
[0:35:58] <HeadsHeldHigh> AH YES
[0:35:58] <ColRedyx> Pretty sure it's all at 100 by default.
[0:35:59] <johnny2by4x6> @Saltmeisterr Yes
[0:36:07] <ColRedyx> BGM and Voice at 100 and everything else at 50 is perfect.
[0:36:09] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> FFXIV's OST is SO FUCKING GOOD TOO
[0:36:11] <Mexrage> if playing on PS4, the PS4 speaker will do the sound when Queue is ready, so you can change the channel while you wait
[0:36:11] <HeadsHeldHigh> MUSIC should be blasting out your window
[0:36:15] <%QueequegTheater> @Saltmeisterr Lancer is spear bois, once Lancer is at 30 and you have Marauder at 15 you can upgrade to Dragoon
[0:36:17] <%LegendGHT> apatDab Stormfeelers role call
[0:36:18] <$valriot> PLEASE SHOW OMEGA, PAT
[0:36:19] <ColRedyx> And yeah 14's music is godlike
[0:36:20] <+Xalgar> Used to be a Stormfeeler till the FC chat got a ton of rules and became ResidentSleeper
[0:36:27] <+iwasJase> it also helps that FFXIV BGM is AMAZING
[0:36:32] <%Keyd00d> 📝
[0:36:32] <Mexrage> PS4 controller speaker i mean
[0:36:33] <%QueequegTheater> FATE guitar theme Kreygasm
[0:36:35] <$Yakobro> @QueequegTheater don't need cross class since stormblood
[0:36:37] <%Venhammer> @ItsYaGirlMaria It has a world record for most pieces of music in a single piece of media
[0:36:41] <Thalchampz> @QueequegTheater no need to level marauder anymore, just lancer to 30
[0:36:42] <shockmaster3> Make it an even 100
[0:36:43] <GarbageQueenEllie> That's what I do
[0:36:50] <%Reizie_Etherealm> You guys wanna hear some HERESY? I mute the BGM so I can play my own songs when I play
[0:36:51] <%QueequegTheater> @Yakobro Well I wasted like two hours on Wednesday LUL
[0:36:53] <%Venhammer> @Xalgar Same, left a while ago

[0:37:23] <%Ner234> LUL
[0:37:26] <%supersugoisenpai1> OCD satisfied
[0:37:29] <Dastardry> You should look up a video of all the voices because some are freaking unbearable when you play jobs like Archer/Bard

[0:37:36] <@JustinianKnight> the cities are bad right now
[0:37:37] <%NWR_James> destroy the fps
[0:37:39] <%QueequegTheater> NOTICE US
[0:37:40] <%RadDude6969> hi Pat :)
[0:37:46] <HeadsHeldHigh> POWER
[0:37:55] <ShichiNoBushi> Everyone's gong to move to the other side.
[0:38:01] <Ggamre> I'm kinda over orchestral ost's
[0:38:01] <+Justlaxy> o I wanna do the shadowbringers benchmark so bye for now.
[0:38:07] <+Bipolarhernandez> I heard that dote
[0:38:14] <+SuicidalLemmming> get a better pc nerd
[0:38:15] <@SSaryn> And if you really want something better than that, use a Reshade or something.
[0:38:21] <%kujofire990> Ps4 settings....don't have to do shit
[0:38:25] <@SSaryn> MXAO is preeeeeeeety gud
[0:38:29] <supuhmagikarp> Mouse??
[0:38:32] <GarbageQueenEllie> That's the thing that Elmo chases
[0:38:33] <Mexrage> is a small rodent
[0:38:34] <%MegboyManuel> i click my skills with my mouse
[0:38:36] <shockmaster3> Mouse is for editing and ultra porn
[0:38:38] <%Bane_Kaikyo> a smol rodent
[0:38:38] <%valkuma> is Pat on Famfrit
[0:38:39] <%Lapinelis> What if the benchmark gives you like 15k points at max?
[0:38:39] <TheWhiskeySpirit> Nani!?
[0:38:39] <johnny2by4x6> Its pretty good
[0:38:42] <ShichiNoBushi> That some sort of rodent?
[0:38:42] <%VanaSkiller> the thing that can't swin
[0:38:42] <Ggamre> feel like all the orchestral osts blend together too much
[0:38:43] <$Valdorick> Mouse options are always dependent on the mouse and user anyway, so fuck that setting anyway.
[0:38:46] <Saltmeisterr> is pat just gonna be talking about beginner stuff?
[0:38:47] <+iwasJase> @AngriestPat are you gonna cover parsing/DPS meters or nah?
[0:38:48] <%MegboyManuel> apparently im weird and dumb for clicking my skills
[0:38:48] <%valkuma> !ffxiv
[0:38:52] <%valkuma> !ff14
[0:38:54] <%QueequegTheater> So what are Dragoons getting in the new expansion?
[0:38:54] <%MegboyManuel> :/
[0:38:55] <ShichiNoBushi> I thought we dealt with the rats, already.
[0:38:56] <narusao> protips
[0:39:00] <%valkuma> What server is pat on?
[0:39:01] <+bluedude152> Show us pat, show us your fans terrible costumes
[0:39:02] <+QuasartheHero> @kujofire990 because the console version is fixed so shit dont break
[0:39:02] <theobble> the wanderers have arrived.
[0:39:09] <%QueequegTheater> Is it a huge rework or just buffs
[0:39:15] <%voremommy69> Ultros on the primal data center @valkuma
[0:39:19] <%valkuma> oo
[0:39:19] <%kujofire990> @QuasartheHero it's perfect....
[0:39:23] <fearhurst> what is touchpad for
[0:39:26] <%Venhammer> @QueequegTheater Super sick jumps, same one that nidhogg uses
[0:39:28] <%tyler274> i totally want controller on when client is inactive
[0:39:29] <@SSaryn> And if you're a KB+M player, you can stand over the controller peasants Kappa
[0:39:37] <%supersugoisenpai1> Touchpad works like a mouse
[0:39:38] <Dastardry> Vibration is crucial for leveling Fishing.
[0:39:38] <Mexrage> it only function for certain cutscenes on PS4 @AngriestPat
[0:39:39] <MoonObscure> xD
[0:39:46] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> autorun is great and terrible at the same time
[0:39:48] <ColRedyx> @MegboyManuel Yeah, you should find a keybind setup so you can hit everything with keys, it's faster.
[0:39:52] <PontiusPyrite> the vibration doesn't work on the ds4 for me
[0:39:53] <Saltmeisterr> rip Nintendo switch pro controller
[0:39:55] <Ggamre> @ssaryn obviously keyboard+controller is the pinnacle
[0:39:56] <troytaco> run pat
[0:39:58] <@JustinianKnight> Use Vibrate for Fishing
[0:39:59] <%QueequegTheater> @Venhammer Cool. I'm only just past Titan so far so I don't know who that is
[0:40:00] <Dio_TR> Woolie's brain is melting so why not watch Pat talk about an mmo for 8 hours
[0:40:02] <%kujofire990> @ItsYaGirlMaria i'm leaning that slowly
[0:40:03] <%MegboyManuel> Listen man, nothing is faster than clicking on your skills
[0:40:03] <%tyler274> switch pro controller does work
[0:40:04] <%Ner234> Weirdos just crowding LUL
[0:40:05] <LandOfTheWay> @AngriestPat you can't escape the manderville manbo
[0:40:07] <%tyler274> just use the non shit drivers
[0:40:11] <LandOfTheWay> *mambo
[0:40:13] <%QueequegTheater> @AngriestPat Alright, I gotta jet, catch you on the VOD
[0:40:14] <%MegboyManuel> That is the shortest fucking Roe ive seen
[0:40:14] <%tyler274> or steam
[0:40:16] <@mothmandraws> ESPECIALLY TO WAKING SANDS
[0:40:18] <%AquilaHarukaze> I'd like auto run but I hold L1 and use the D-pad to select enemies on the aggro list and I end up accidentally auto running whenever I do that :c
[0:40:20] <@mothmandraws> IM FED UP OF WAKING SANDS
[0:40:25] <%Venhammer> @QueequegTheater Oh woops, just know that you get a lot of cool stuff between now and the current endgame
[0:40:26] <zecht89> Is pat a roe?
[0:40:26] <Monkeyweed21> Where is your job crystal pat
[0:40:27] <+mattsoestupido> PRAY RETURN
[0:40:29] <@CreepyPorpoise> Yeah, he made himself as short as he could be iirc
[0:40:29] <%Remery_> more time to Wank
[0:40:30] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> nice way to sneak away from everyone
[0:40:31] <+iwasJase> @JustinianKnight facts. vibrate while afk fishing on controller is top tier.
[0:40:31] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Pray return to the waking sands!

[0:43:47] <%Venhammer> @RioGascar You should roll on stuff your character can equip?
[0:43:48] <FairOnFire> we need a "right" emote for every time pat says it
[0:43:48] <$Valdorick> He killed the Lalifels, and the Moogles too!
[0:43:50] <ColRedyx> It's L3 that's Draw Weapon/Lock On by default. CHANGE THAT ASAP. Draw/Sheathe Weapon. Lock on SUCKS.

[0:44:54] <Lotharman> Hey, FF14 around here? Awesome!
[0:45:01] <@mothmandraws> THE FINAL MACRO (hard)
[0:45:03] <%LegendCobra> das a lot o macros

[0:45:20] <FairOnFire> oh shit that's actually useful. i need to do that
[0:45:21] <helpmeimafruit> wtf sprint is free now?
[0:45:21] <ColRedyx> Sprint is free. Sprint often. Sprint all the time.
[0:45:25] <%MegboyManuel> SLOPPY
[0:45:26] <StaticSunrise> I want to use primarily MKB but I want my arcade stick to be a hotbar on its own
[0:45:27] <@SSaryn> To be fair, Mages were fine till you NERFED IT
[0:45:27] <Jarvanii> I have peloton and mount on the same macro as well
[0:45:28] <umbrus89> lvl 64 lancer thats a first xD
[0:45:31] <%CitrusDrink> It's free but a longer cooldown now
[0:45:32] <ricotez> sprint has been free since the launch of stormblood
[0:45:34] <$Valdorick> All your TP, suck it War DPS, Caster's escape all the AoEs!
[0:45:38] <%MegboyManuel> SLOPPEH *fucking sprint*
[0:45:38] <ColRedyx> Doesn't need to be on the stick, just bind sprint and use it.
[0:45:38] <+Sgt_Wigglytuff> I've been switching with R1 and a button to sprint this whole time lol
[0:45:39] <theobble> sprint duration used to last as long as how much tp you burned. it was weird af
[0:45:41] <+iwasJase> like AOE markers in end-game raids LUL
[0:45:42] <%BlitzNeidhart> Sprint is mandatory in some of the hardest fights
[0:45:43] <@mothmandraws> I saw some meme macros
[0:45:46] <%Zamorouskiwhich> Maybe there are randoms on the internet standing behind you and you need to run ruuS
[0:45:51] <BunnyEmperor> man im glad not playing with a controller
[0:45:54] <%LegendGHT> i don't even know macros lol I think I need to know
[0:45:55] <@mothmandraws> ninja trick attack "now its time for an all out attack"

[0:46:23] <%BlitzNeidhart> @LegendGHT You can't
[0:46:27] <%gespenst25> sprint also builds the LB gague or at least it used to
[0:46:28] <mikash81> suicide isn't the answer pat
[0:46:29] <%LegendGHT> oh
[0:46:29] <ShichiNoBushi> Go to high level zone so it'll filter out about half of these guys.
[0:46:30] <CyndaneTierney> I was kind of surprised that he didn't go into a private apartment, or something.
[0:46:32] <ColRedyx> @LegendGHT You can't infinite sprint, but you can bind a macro to your analog sticks.
[0:46:33] <%Reizie_Etherealm> You can do the same but switch the stick to L3 instead of R3 too if you prefer
[0:46:33] <Xelhesia> omg these guys XD
[0:46:33] <@SSaryn> You also need to know that there are many memes in FFXIV, you should play FFXIV just for this reason.
[0:46:39] <%Venhammer> it's really nice that pat is giving the rundown of all the basic stuff
[0:46:45] <$Valdorick> Okay guys, ALL OF YOU stop following him... Only one of you should follow him, then the next person should follow that guy, then the next, then next LUL
[0:46:47] <+megaman0591> Was that a Dante glamor on one of those people?

[0:47:06] <%Arnschen> Legacy>Standard
[0:47:10] <+Bipolarhernandez> god gpose is so good
[0:47:11] <%MegboyManuel> can we only have cat girls following Pat, only cat girls
[0:47:14] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Free movement!
[0:47:15] <ColRedyx> Legacy is so much better than standard.
[0:47:16] <yosukecchi> it says a lot that someone like pat is doing controller stuff. it means that he really loves the game
[0:47:16] <DetroitSentai> I actually hate legacy
[0:47:26] <Dastardry> Don't be a backpedaling silly person
[0:47:26] <%Harawanagangsta> Strafing
[0:47:29] <%MegboyManuel> YEH LEGACY, suck my dicc blitz
[0:47:32] <%kujofire990> TANK CONTROL?
[0:47:46] <+TheDestinyPotato> You should only use standard if you're used to playing other MMO's on keyboard like WoW
[0:47:48] <$Yakobro> tank controls!
[0:47:48] <DetroitSentai> If you need to run just use mouse movement
[0:47:49] <+MaddyCaddy> But Dragoons can backflip
[0:47:49] <%QuadraticGravity> Standard is for M&K, Legacy is for Controller
[0:47:49] <%Venhammer> legacy best just for the back upo
[0:47:51] <%Fidranth> but I like spinning my camera around!
[0:47:51] <%MegboyManuel> Legacy is FAR superior
[0:47:52] <%Dkun4> Even on mouse Legacy is better, fuck standard type
[0:47:52] <%Harawanagangsta> no, not tank controls. its strafing
[0:47:52] <%MrBorisMakarov> oooooooooo
[0:47:52] <ColRedyx> You will also do that if you lock on, which is why you should unbind it immediately.
[0:47:53] <AdmiralButtloaf> oh shit
[0:47:54] <%Arnschen> Only villains use Standard
[0:47:55] <%BlitzNeidhart> @MegboyManuel STANDARD IS BETTER ON M+KB
[0:47:58] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Either spin the cam like a peasant or FREE RUN like a pro
[0:47:58] <AdmiralButtloaf> thanks for that tip pat
[0:48:05] <Basch71> put that shit ob
[0:48:07] <Basch71> on
[0:48:08] <%WackyGear> "kapow chitah chpow" - Pat
[0:48:10] <Nurdock> Alas my broken mind which kept using this while you needed to face enemies to autoattack them
[0:48:11] <ColRedyx> @BlitzNeidhart It's really not.
[0:48:12] <@mothmandraws> skip all cutscenes, speedrun
[0:48:13] <%MegboyManuel> @BlitzNeidhart no you though!
[0:48:13] <%Venhammer> @QuadraticGravity nah I still use legacy with mouse and keyboard
[0:48:14] <Nurdock> And now can't change
[0:48:14] <%Lapinelis> Praetorium
[0:48:14] <%Dkun4> @BlitzNeidhart No it isn't!
[0:48:14] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> turn all those on

[0:48:24] <%MegboyManuel> yeyeyeye legacyyyyy
[0:48:26] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> you WILL be left behind
[0:48:26] <FairOnFire> fuck i didn't know about that either
[0:48:26] <Dastardry> Turning your camera away from the action and strafing away is never the right option
[0:48:29] <%Arnschen> Everyone is waiting for you
[0:48:29] <@SSaryn> Especially the NEW 24-man dungeons.
[0:48:35] <MoonObscure> ^

[0:48:56] <%Solidus_113> @AngriestPat what targeting options make it so I stop tabbing between enemies who aren't in combat?
[0:48:56] <Lotharman> Remember the story raids from ARR? LUL
[0:49:02] <Arktonyel> What DC is Pat on?
[0:49:03] <%Remery_> Can't wait for the Furry Races quiettAww
[0:49:18] <Manooz> Protip: you CAN rewatch cutscenes in ANY Inn and using the Adventurer's Log or whatever it's called!
[0:49:23] <%Harawanagangsta> Literally the Shire Theme except not
[0:49:28] <+megaman0591> Pretty sure it’s the Primal Dc
[0:49:29] <ColRedyx> @AngriestPat "3rd Person Camera Angle" under the character tab is very handy for taller HUD layouts or just seeing stuff behind you.
[0:49:31] <$Valdorick> UNLESS YOU ARE HEALING (antipoobot)
[0:49:35] <yosukecchi> but healer?
[0:49:41] <GarbageQueenEllie> But friendly fire is funny

[0:49:55] <+Zepshire> didn't know about the cutscene skipper until I was light farming
[0:49:59] <%Zamorouskiwhich> They are enemies, destroy them! ruuFight
[0:50:00] <ColRedyx> Because that's target cycling with left/right Pat.
[0:50:00] <ShichiNoBushi> They're enemies because they are jackasses.
[0:50:01] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> NPCs LUL
[0:50:04] <Amberizing> what about pets for summoners?
[0:50:11] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Weapon drawn = combat mode where your target select becomes enemy only
[0:50:11] <%MegboyManuel> Its not the hildibrand dance, im not impressed with this schmuckssss
[0:50:11] <ColRedyx> It doesn't affect targeting with X.
[0:50:13] <lirowisk> Friends atpLaw atpWind
[0:50:25] <@mothmandraws> its me chat
[0:50:25] <%MegboyManuel> Give me hildibrand dance ya scrubs
[0:50:25] <BunnyEmperor> friendly fire
[0:50:27] <@mothmandraws> in the distance
[0:50:29] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> turn off battle effects for others if you do like eureka on ps4

[0:50:46] <Lotharman> Randomize idle animation is cool sometimes
[0:50:47] <@mothmandraws> I dont have it yet
[0:50:50] <Dastardry> This is not a problem on m+kb btw, only for controllers
[0:50:53] <ColRedyx> Only if you don't select hotbar 1 when out of combat.
[0:50:56] <@mothmandraws> im a lowly lvl 26
[0:50:56] <%MegboyManuel> FUCK
[0:50:59] <badhaye> ....

[0:51:16] <Manooz> maybe I do pat
[0:51:17] <%Venhammer> this is especially important for 24 man raids
[0:51:17] <Xyall> But I like blinding the melee with RDM lb3
[0:51:19] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> except the RDM LB3, everyone has to see that
[0:51:19] <HeadsHeldHigh> You don't wanna see my 5 fell cleaves? :(
[0:51:20] <%THATGUY_789> where was the discord company again
[0:51:25] <Nurdock> Arsenal runs are the worst for this
[0:51:27] <Dastardry> Try playing a melee job with all effects on.
[0:51:27] <@mothmandraws> good, I fight with my heart not my eyes
[0:51:28] <ColRedyx> If you have hotbar 1 selected when out of combat then your hotbar won't change when you put your weapon away.
[0:51:29] <%voremommy69> tfw 2400 hours and i just found out about this setting

[0:51:31] <@SSaryn> I like WHM holying in my face every 3 seconds in dungeons.
[0:51:35] <%LegendCobra> what do i press to force everyone to see my move
[0:51:36] <garbageheaphound> what about the enemy?
[0:51:36] <OverlordedK> More importantly see the floor markers below the effects lol
[0:51:37] <helpmeimafruit> You mean you don't want seizure inducing light shows in every raid?
[0:51:38] <mr_hunter> Yeah i really want to see a fucking rdm lb3 during aoes
[0:51:43] <ShichiNoBushi> But what about MMEEEEEE!?
[0:51:43] <@CreepyPorpoise> Like blinding red mage limit breaks
[0:51:44] <Nurdock> Good look seeing anything on AV when there's 20 blms blowing their load on them

[0:52:55] <%crimsonharvest> if you leave it on you'll never be able to see anything
[0:53:00] <@mothmandraws> this group looks goofy from POV up the hill

[0:53:03] <+Justlaxy> I have been using standard controls all this time so I may stick to it cause legacy weirds me out.

[0:54:43] <dickbuttwoman> Crafting is either "Level all, or level none"

[0:54:58] <Covil91> Pat never struck me as a guy to level crafters
[0:54:59] <%AquilaHarukaze> That earth is so salted right now
[0:54:59] <%BlitzNeidhart> Pat has been learning from Billy
[0:55:00] <BunnyEmperor> lmao are you actually swapping between them
[0:55:03] <Mexicanskydiver> But crafting is Duuuuuumb >(
[0:55:05] <Futurecity10> God I love chat
[0:55:08] <ColRedyx> Because every individual window has its own scale.

[0:55:33] <$Valdorick> @mothmandraws Are you shunning pat? Your back is turned LUL
[0:55:36] <robobeau> I'm on PC :B

[0:55:48] <Bielzitcho> that's a lot of crystals
[0:55:49] <@mothmandraws> im just red
[0:55:51] <+ManiacJoe360> @ManiacJoe360 is new here. Say hello! HeyGuys
[0:55:52] <@mothmandraws> hair and face
[0:55:57] <@mothmandraws> just looks like I am
[0:55:59] <$Valdorick> Oh shit! So it is, nevermind
[0:55:59] <+talfurt> What was that little goblin Elmo thing
[0:56:01] <%SpcOpsBear> SpcOpsBear subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months! 
[0:56:05] <%Lapinelis> You're kinda making me want to play this with a controller
[0:56:11] <%Lapinelis> I'm m/k boi
[0:56:15] <PontiusPyrite> there's no such thing as "a lot of crystals"
[0:56:16] <dickbuttwoman> Pat, where the fuck do you find the time to do all this shit
[0:56:17] <$Yakobro> no
[0:56:18] <Nanomachiner> controller fun
[0:56:18] <Xelhesia> controller is fantastic
[0:56:19] <%kujofire990> ah i see you now moth
[0:56:21] <BusterWoIf> you have so much free space
[0:56:27] <Monkeyweed21> SOUL CRYSTAL PAT
[0:56:28] <lucidcalyx> Sorry why is this Pat’s Tutorial Hour?
[0:56:31] <%VioletHeart> I really should try with a controller.
[0:56:32] <@mothmandraws> I like empty UI
[0:56:32] <mustyketchup> why am i watching this i already play this game
[0:56:33] <Reisadan> Controller is bester
[0:56:34] <%MyDarkStorm> What you no Dragoon?
[0:56:34] <GarbageQueenEllie> gotta select FAST
[0:56:34] <%Shadowthedigger> Controller sucks so much.
[0:56:36] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> takes some practice but it goes
[0:56:36] <@mothmandraws> I hate mmo clutter
[0:56:42] <r_Foeburden87> my muscler memory is already coming back
[0:56:42] <+mik255> controller is the shit
[0:56:43] <%MyDarkStorm> Why You No Dragoon
[0:56:44] <+SeriousCreeper> i tried to get used to controller, but had to switch back to keyboard. maybe will try again one day
[0:56:47] <ColRedyx> By the way, Pat doesn't have "Store all newly obtained items in the Armoury Chest" enabled. If you don't have that enabled, then auto-equip won't work until you manually put new gear in the armoury chest.
[0:56:51] <+AlwaysHuffer> i wish i didnt hate controller so much in mmos
[0:56:52] <Dragon_boy21> I think my Only 70's are Dark Knight and red mage. Any suggestions on my next 70?
[0:56:56] <mrpandabear437> I've never not used controller
[0:57:07] <+iwasJase> my only gripe with controller is that i found it hard to move around quests and teleporting from place to place.
[0:57:15] <$Yakobro> @mothmandraws HeyGuys
[0:57:23] <yosukecchi> KENPACHI RAMASAMA?
[0:57:28] <+bluedude152> But how do you see incredible names
[0:57:31] <%LegendGHT> mothman called out live on stream
[0:57:33] <%MegboyManuel> YOU are a fucking dragoon
[0:57:36] <ColRedyx> @AngriestPat You have new gear set not to go in the armoury chest. The auto-equip function can't see gear in the inventory so new players may prefer to have that on.
[0:57:45] <+Revets315> @AngriestPat does the recommended gear button work?
[0:57:46] <x02DannyBoy> Hey Pat, is there a way to make the mouse size bigger without using the 3rd party option to increase it?

[1:06:15] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> its the best
[1:06:22] <ColRedyx> This is why controller works.
[1:06:25] <$Wisconsinite> usually you need a special password for the back bar
[1:06:30] <ColRedyx> The fact that it's not on by default is a crime.
[1:06:32] <IndoorSitup> Aw look at that chicken.
[1:06:32] <+mik255> controller is so well thought out
[1:06:38] <$SleepyMaribo> futre tanks pay attention, this is essential to keeping your party alive
[1:06:44] <Mexrage> i prefer using double tab L2 or R2
[1:06:44] <InsomniacPersona> Hey Gamers
[1:06:48] <@SSaryn> And for Monks, you can just remove One Ilm Punch, btw.
[1:06:48] <%Reizie_Etherealm> @ColRedyx That's all fine and good but I mean, keeping the middle finger holding the trigger, the index spamming skills and using thumb to manipulate the camera as you dance around the AoEs
[1:07:00] <%MegboyManuel> has Pat put on his soul crystal yet?
[1:07:00] <helpmeimafruit> just count down in your head 4Head
[1:07:11] <ColRedyx> You can set up a set of 3 horizontal bars to mimic cross hotbar 2 so you can keep an eye on cooldowns and have a visual aid for your button binds at the same time.
[1:07:12] <%supersugoisenpai1> Damn, that's good

[1:07:22] <+thundiedramon> it's a literal godsend for controller
[1:07:22] <@mothmandraws> you get feeling for it after a bit
[1:07:25] <Kghaleon> *brain explodes*
[1:07:26] <@mothmandraws> similar to RTS
[1:07:30] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> setting up cds on hotbars specifically to keep track of cds is insanely good

[1:08:20] <Forester_Skippy> that move is now confirmed broken as said by the games director
[1:08:28] <+aslfrasle> I still maintain that this game is best on a Steam Controller.
[1:08:29] <dickbuttwoman> Haha, time for gubal!
[1:08:33] <%MegboyManuel> passage of arms is 2 minutes, much more important to keep track of

[1:10:41] <%Leodude> @AngriestPat Doing MSQs once is the best thing for a WoW refugee.
[1:10:41] <Jdrockefeller> people only make alts if you wanna get around loot lock outs or you just like dressing up different characters
[1:10:42] <Tucker0603> AND THATS WHY I LOVE THiS GAME!
[1:10:43] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Too late I have 3 alts.
[1:10:44] <$Bonkasaurusrex> Blue mage got done dirty. It should have been a real job.
[1:10:44] <Malziel> god that's so FUCKING GOOD
[1:10:45] <+thundiedramon> you can for RP, wanting to play on a different data center
[1:10:46] <Calek> I'd only make a new character to experience the story

[1:13:00] <+kyuubisonic> I lost my layout cause i didn't back it up after not playing for a year. It sucks.
[1:13:01] <ColRedyx> Bring your target bar and status effects down to the bottom guys.
[1:13:09] <@mothmandraws> I put my status ticks just above HP and stuff

[1:13:47] <%CaptainKarite> Is there a way to auto target an enemy?
[1:13:52] <ColRedyx> @AngriestPat Go into HUD layout and select the target bar, then click the gear. You can also split up status effects.
[1:13:55] <BunnyEmperor> you drag the gear into the hotbar
[1:13:59] <Monkeyweed21> @cvp5127 Red mage is easy to learn and great for solo play
[1:13:59] <+Rabbitmage> Tell us about the font color window

[1:14:27] <@mothmandraws> pc with controler
[1:14:28] <@SSaryn> You can do that with your buffs/debuffs/enhancements, etc; as well.
[1:14:30] <%QuadraticGravity> Now the boss cast bar can be made REAL BIG
[1:14:33] <ColRedyx> Put all that shit at the bottom.
[1:14:34] <OverlordedK> That could save my melee ass from certain spells...
[1:14:39] <iheartmota> yea you can make the enemy progress bar REALLY large
[1:14:41] <+blastazoid26> PogChamp
[1:14:44] <Forester_Skippy> dump that castbar jsut above the center so you neve rmiss it for thsoe spicy cleaves

[1:19:03] <ShichiNoBushi> Level Stynk
[1:19:04] <BunnyEmperor> sleipnir barding?
[1:19:04] <Angry_Ev1L> ALso you can make a macro to lvl sync and literally press 1 button
[1:19:06] <haveswordmuststing> i think
[1:19:08] <superchronicc> but why use level sync?
[1:19:10] <ColRedyx> What Pat's failing to say is that pressing select cycles your cursor through different parts of the UI.
[1:19:13] <zecht89> wow a controller is awful lol
[1:19:18] <%SirGO0SE> @thundiedramon wait its a real thing thats in the game? lmao amazing. ty
[1:19:19] <%rumtumtugnutz> Fates are lame.

[1:19:25] <Mr_Strut> That sounds terrible. Why would you ever do that though?
[1:19:32] <%valkuma> use a mouse instead Kappa
[1:19:32] <Quietshun13> you have to use level sync
[1:19:32] <%CitrusDrink> You have to use level synch to join the FATEs
[1:19:35] <+NYCrownlessKing> cause u have to.. @Mr_Strut
[1:19:36] <%rumtumtugnutz> Especially when you do 300 of them for 12 stinking Atma crystals. >>
[1:19:37] <+thundiedramon> @sirgo0se yeah, it was available up until last week
[1:19:39] <HibikiYamada> @Shadowthedigger they made it 200 GC Seals ages ago
[1:19:43] <Mr_Strut> Well that's lame
[1:19:45] <JamJamX3> @AngriestPat Sorry if you've been asked this a lot, but what server do you play on?
[1:19:48] <+Ell1ot> did i miss Pat's controller lesson?
[1:19:56] <superchronicc> @NYCrownlessKing you have to use level sync becasue?
[1:19:56] <+NYCrownlessKing> its not. dont do low level fates @Mr_Strut

[1:20:12] <ColRedyx> @AngriestPat Before you get off controller, Mothman linked another really slick way to track cooldowns on controller earlier. It's what I use.
[1:20:16] <+NYCrownlessKing> because its a LEVEL...5..FATE..a lvl70 player will ruin fates for all new players if they can do it WITHOUT syncing @superchronicc
[1:20:19] <+Rabbitmage> I want to change into a minor
[1:20:19] <haveswordmuststing> i just have a grid with all of them displayed because Keyboard
[1:20:19] <$Valdorick> FATEs get you stuff, like worthless pets that follow you around and do nothing!
[1:20:21] <%rumtumtugnutz> I never thought of hotbarring Job Crystals.
[1:20:23] <%CaptainKarite> Or apatHoldon
[1:20:26] <JamJamX3> Fark. I was hoping he was on Crystal or something so I could visit!
[1:20:26] <+NYCrownlessKing> so u must sync..to make it fair for everyone @superchronicc
[1:20:28] <%rumtumtugnutz> I AM A PUTZ

[1:21:30] <+Sgt_Wigglytuff> How are you doing lockons on enemies that you have free movement for. mine always makes me slowwalk backward and strafe.
[1:21:37] <Angry_Ev1L> rip heavy thrust

[1:21:57] <ssks123> wait they're removing heavy thrust?
[1:22:03] <%rumtumtugnutz> Someone should start a *** to save heavy Thrust. Even though I hate it.
[1:22:05] <theobble> go to a dummy
[1:22:06] <ssks123> are they at least replacing it?
[1:22:07] <%QuadraticGravity> @ssks123 ye

[1:22:14] <%Arnschen> Nope, just gone
[1:22:14] <xmetalicdemonx> Thats cool you can get used to the mechanics starting early in the game. Thats cool
[1:22:15] <%crimsonharvest> sync to a low fate
[1:22:15] <+NYCrownlessKing> just dont worry about it @ssks123
[1:22:15] <ssks123> fucking RIPP
[1:22:16] <%Typhaeon> Yeah it's a 10% damage buff from Disembowel now
[1:22:19] <ColRedyx> Hell no, Heavy Thrust can go.
[1:22:20] <+NYCrownlessKing> their doing something with it
[1:22:21] <%Typhaeon> And no piercing debuff
[1:22:22] <%QuadraticGravity> Heavy thrust is leaving, and the damage buff is being moved to Disembowel
[1:22:23] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> you can set up combos on buttons any way you want
[1:22:30] <Dakuu75> where's that cross-hotbar, son
[1:22:32] <ssks123> im glad piercing/slashing is going tho

[1:23:28] <KazMkII> Didn't expect to take a FFXIV college course today Kappa
[1:23:30] <@mothmandraws> pro tips new ppl, the game gives you a handy guide on where to stand, big orange circles pop up, those are where you should stand to be safe
[1:23:37] <%valkuma> Im probably in the minority here but i HATE the global cooldown in FFXIV its so long and painful
[1:23:39] <%EvilSoully> @AngriestPat How much do you like the Dragoon, anyway?
[1:23:40] <%QuadraticGravity> what moth said
[1:23:42] <Covil91> As a caster I put spells on dpad and instants on face buttons
[1:23:42] <%a_lucky_soul> Ninja seals are excellent examples of button combos
[1:23:46] <$valriot> Anyone watching this is literally now better than 70% of the playerbase @angriestpat
[1:23:46] <troytaco> pat is tall and imposing
[1:23:48] <%Reizie_Etherealm> I've had to claw an OGCD on the d-pad before while needing to move, so what I ended up doing is use my right thumb for the movement stick and use the left thumb for the d-pad
[1:23:49] <xeros720> did the hall of newbies the other day, it's pretty damn great
[1:23:50] <+NYCrownlessKing> dont listen to moth

[1:24:04] <+NYCrownlessKing> Blood for the Blood god
[1:24:06] <%Venhammer> @valkuma I mean if it wasn't long weaving in off-GCD's endgame would be impossible
[1:24:07] <@JustinianKnight> oh wait
[1:24:09] <snowmanse> @valkuma The reason it's slow is because when you level up you get a lot of off gcd abilities you weave in between.
[1:24:10] <ColRedyx> Oh yeah, speaking of AOEs and telegraphs, it would be a very good idea to explain to people the desync between target locking and damage.
[1:24:14] <ssks123> learning how to weave with DRG is some shit
[1:24:15] <+millionstabz> @AngriestPat Is there a way to pay for sub via in-game currency?
[1:24:20] <KVD22> fuck him up
[1:24:21] <ssks123> granted i only know DRG lmao
[1:24:23] <%rumtumtugnutz> Dragoons are the most necessary class cause you always need a floor tank.
[1:24:27] <theobble> how about some jumps
[1:24:28] <+NYCrownlessKing> no @millionstabz
[1:24:29] <+Kurogane_Dread> @millionstabz nope.

[1:24:49] <@SSaryn> And if you love weaving, play DRG, NIN, MNK.
[1:24:54] <%crimsonharvest> weaving always was and will be bullshit
[1:24:57] <xmetalicdemonx> Whats a jump?
[1:24:59] <@mothmandraws> 4 more levels then I can do jump
[1:25:00] <DefaultSettiings> Pat are you gonna be a bunny or a mutant lion OhMyDog
[1:25:05] <+NYCrownlessKing> bob and weave or be a loser and be a ranged DPS that just stands there

[1:25:25] <dickbuttwoman> Holy fuck level 45 CNJ IS THE WORST
[1:25:25] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Weaving is fun most of the time if you do it right
[1:25:26] <xeros720> REAL SHIT
[1:25:28] <moogleboy1984> Shoutouts to MRD in Labs, because MRD did more damage
[1:25:29] <Angry_Ev1L> SMN was a weaving machine. Not sure about 5.0 tho. They change a bunch of stuff
[1:25:30] <%DavidSanChan> lvl 34 streamer
[1:25:32] <Rhinoprotoss> Oh man that's a lot
[1:25:33] <@SSaryn> Like JUMPS, who would have guessed.
[1:25:34] <+NYCrownlessKing> REAL SHIT
[1:25:35] <Paranoid_Jumbotron> rip Minh
[1:25:36] <%Agami23> @AngriestPat but pat, Mihn said he beat the 2nd coil with just a lancer!
[1:25:37] <flubber3d> neet class
[1:25:41] <ColRedyx> If you are still a class at level 31, people wion't like you!
[1:25:45] <Kghaleon> each has a quest attached to it, if I recall
[1:25:52] <BunnyEmperor> Nastrond Poggers
[1:25:52] <xeros720> Minh is a dick to his friends for doing that
[1:25:54] <+enterprise900> That means that Minh got carried through second coul
[1:25:56] <Quietshun13> minh literally gimped his team
[1:25:56] <ssks123> @AngriestPat i once did a 24 man with like 3 normal classes and they kept pulling the bosses
[1:25:58] <ricotez> there used to be a lancer build that worked in coil
[1:25:58] <DefaultSettiings> but what about Blue Mage PowerUpL LUL PowerUpR
[1:26:00] <+enterprise900> *coil
[1:26:03] <Paranoid_Jumbotron> nah Minh kicks ass shut up
[1:26:05] <haveswordmuststing> @Agami23 but he's amazing at being Lancer so why be useful Kappa
[1:26:06] <$Valdorick> Much like in real life, if you don't have a job at past 30, people will judge you Kappa
[1:26:06] <+ravenrooke> Wow! D:
[1:26:06] <mikesapartment> Nut of the Dragon
[1:26:08] <Analogflame> oh shit. I'm lvl 30 rn. I'l lget on that quest
[1:26:09] <+Dessbocito2> OMEGALUL
[1:26:11] <r_Foeburden87> Flashy
[1:26:11] <Rhinoprotoss> What's happening
[1:26:12] <ricotez> but not anymore, not after the cross-class skill system got changed
[1:26:15] <%QuadraticGravity> forgot Mirage Dive
[1:26:16] <+Taglog7> "Becuase I'm fukin gud!" - minh
[1:26:16] <%Linearlinera> uhhhhhhh
[1:26:21] <KatabolicRage> teach em on monk lol
[1:26:23] <%seraphimjordan> @AngriestPat you are doing a great job and im learning a lot which is good for me because im very unfamiliar with mmos
[1:26:24] <ah_ping> oh of course
[1:26:24] <%LegendCobra> no newbie is going to get that
[1:26:25] <Valsera> pat I'm a 380 drk and I feel confident in tanking but I don't feel like I'm dpsing enough, is this normal?
[1:26:27] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> positionals are also super important
[1:26:27] <%Venhammer> This is why the GCD is long, you have A TON of stuff to weave
[1:26:28] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Global, off global, global, off global, rinse and repeat
[1:26:29] <%Keaton_x> I don't even know what just happened...
[1:26:30] <%Linearlinera> that's a lotta buttons
[1:26:31] <%MisterTylerrr> MisterTylerrr subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 16 months! 
[1:26:32] <troytaco> should do monk to show off positionals ;3
[1:26:34] <moogleboy1984> Just play BLM
[1:26:35] <Monkeyweed21> Minh needs no job crystal
[1:26:37] <ColRedyx> If you only played 14 up to level 30 and you thought it was slow, you just didn't keep at it long enough.
[1:26:39] <@SSaryn> And if you like many buttons, go play NIN.
[1:26:39] <+Bad1uck> @ssks123 That's when you let natural selection take it's course and tell everyone else to hold back
[1:26:46] <ColRedyx> The game is anything but slow at endgame.
[1:26:48] <Forester_Skippy> fucking drk opener right now is so stupid with weaving
[1:26:49] <@mothmandraws> the global cooldown as said gets easier when you get those skills
[1:26:49] <@JustinianKnight> Yes, hit all of the buttons
[1:26:56] <@mothmandraws> as it speeds up
[1:26:58] <+NYCrownlessKing> Pat is saying do Weapon Attack > GCD > Weapon Attack > GCD. you can link buff moves inbetween the animations. of your combos
[1:26:58] <Analogflame> is summoner strict?
[1:27:01] <lachlanpal> Just started the stream and this game, was there a reason for this tutorial stream?
[1:27:02] <+NYCrownlessKing> gcd's are sub-moves
[1:27:03] <%rumtumtugnutz> LOL ASS stab
[1:27:06] <%crimsonharvest> read. the. damn. words.

[1:27:18] <Rhinoprotoss> What is potency?
[1:27:18] <@mothmandraws> hes streaming this because artists are scrubs
[1:27:19] <+FadingEmber> !uptime
[1:27:19] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 27m.
[1:27:20] <%Reizie_Etherealm> It's a god damn mmoRPG play it like a god damn RPG!
[1:27:22] <zajoestar> whats a flank?
[1:27:24] <+NYCrownlessKing> dmg @Rhinoprotoss
[1:27:24] <flubber3d> never read
[1:27:25] <%Straylightgg> you can jump in between gcd skills
[1:27:25] <xmetalicdemonx> Oh shit thats cool.
[1:27:29] <%ShogunNoonto> he he shown gloryist doman steel yet
[1:27:30] <%EvilSoully> Oh this is a LEGIT TUTORIAL you're doing
[1:27:30] <GarbageQueenEllie> Pegging 101
[1:27:32] <KruelDestiny> 🤔 the pole has a butthole
[1:27:35] <+NYCrownlessKing> where u put it in the butt @zajoestar
[1:27:35] <yosukecchi> the butt hole...
[1:27:38] <%BlitzNeidhart> @Rhinoprotoss The damage potency
[1:27:40] <+SweepTheLegoMyEggo> this game is wayyyy too generic fantasy looking for me
[1:27:42] <ColRedyx> The little nub on one side is the front, the gap is the rear, and the sides are the flanks.
[1:27:45] <%Arnschen> @Analogflame It is now, but with the new expansion, it's going to be a bit better
[1:27:48] <BunnyEmperor> no new player will ever learn to play a job by watching a stream, just play it to max level and you get the basics
[1:27:48] <+Valiantsystem> positionals get you killed ;P
[1:27:50] <%killfrost11> number go up
[1:27:52] <Cerabret100> Gonna be honest, i fucking hate positionals
[1:27:58] <%LegendCobra> do the big damage
[1:27:59] <+Ell1ot> i think i made a black mage
[1:28:00] <Jdrockefeller> play caster
[1:28:00] <@mothmandraws> just pop true north
[1:28:01] <+Bad1uck> @mothmandraws I feel like Pat just made us all look like scrubs
[1:28:03] <+FadingEmber> Did he start a new character?
[1:28:03] <%Venhammer> @SweepTheLegoMyEggo Its Final Fantasy, what do you expect
[1:28:04] <Jdrockefeller> casters have no positionals
[1:28:07] <sonofthedeepsouth> DABS
[1:28:09] <ColRedyx> @BunnyEmperor If that was true, you wouldn't see the truly awful players you do at max level.
[1:28:10] <JamJamX3> @AngriestPat Thoughts on Dancer?
[1:28:14] <%fFailureatlife> im lost
[1:28:17] <sonofthedeepsouth> !uptime
[1:28:17] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 28m.
[1:28:19] <xeros720> people saying this is generic looking hasn't watched the Regalia roll by
[1:28:20] <Jdrockefeller> melee dps are usually the ones that use positionals
[1:28:21] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> getting rid of heavy thrust makes the dance smoother and people dont realize it
[1:28:23] <ssks123> positionals on PUG/MNK confuses the shit out of me
[1:28:23] <KruelDestiny> Magic don't give a fuck FeelsGoodMan
[1:28:25] <sonofthedeepsouth> however?
[1:28:26] <Linvoni> Monks are almost ALL positionals
[1:28:26] <%LegendCobra> so just melee dps then
[1:28:28] <+FadingEmber> nvm
[1:28:28] <+NYCrownlessKing> some moves require u to be standing on the side of the enemy or behind to get better damage @fFailureatlife
[1:28:29] <ssks123> i just need to get used to it
[1:28:29] <ItIsSky> caster attacks are omnipositional
[1:28:33] <+NYCrownlessKing> so.. MOVE @fFailureatlife
[1:28:34] <%Arnschen> Sam has 2 I believe
[1:28:35] <theobble> wjay
[1:28:35] <ColRedyx> @BunnyEmperor I have TONS of empirical evidence that people do not learn their job just from leveling.
[1:28:37] <Monkeyweed21> Real men play MNK
[1:28:39] <helpmeimafruit> just roleplay as an ice-only BLM Kappa
[1:28:42] <Helghast102> SAM has very little but they're extremely important
[1:28:42] <Darkrenai> Monk has all the positionals
[1:28:43] <%LegendGHT> since I play dps that's probably why I've never heard of it
[1:28:45] <Latija> wait i just realized flank is different from rear
[1:28:46] <HoldBtoRun> is it easier to deal with Square's launcher or Steam for 14?
[1:28:46] <ShichiNoBushi> Oh no! They've found you, Pat!
[1:28:48] <Angry_Ev1L> Summoner is literally the best JOB
[1:28:49] <beelzebubdafirst> bard is best
[1:28:50] <Xelhesia> samurai has two positionals
[1:28:50] <+Dessbocito2> even realer play lala monks
[1:28:52] <Pallion_> NIN only has two
[1:28:53] <Jdrockefeller> DRG positionals are easy. And also you don't need to move aaaaalll the way
[1:28:58] <%fFailureatlife> @NYCrownlessKing got it, stay still
[1:28:59] <%ShogunNoonto> real floor tanks play sam
[1:28:59] <umbrus89> i cant mnk
[1:29:01] <%shawntk_> @HoldBtoRun Square's
[1:29:04] <Dastardry> Monk sure is fun, flank flank back, back back, flank, flank flank flank, back back back repeat forever
[1:29:05] <+NYCrownlessKing> exactly.
[1:29:05] <sonofthedeepsouth> Is Dancer healsut?
[1:29:05] <BunnyEmperor> @colredyx i dont count the ignorant ones who dont bother improving after reaching max level
[1:29:06] <Jdrockefeller> you just need to stradle the boarder of rear and flank
[1:29:07] <xmetalicdemonx> You can have multiple classes for the same character?
[1:29:13] <ssks123> yes
[1:29:14] <+Qsmash_> i didn't know this
[1:29:14] <%shawntk_> @sonofthedeepsouth No, it's DPS
[1:29:14] <Jdrockefeller> yes
[1:29:15] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@ColRedyx) (warning)
[1:29:16] <%Nanocomputer> yep
[1:29:16] <Xelhesia> yes
[1:29:16] <$Valdorick> And note that solo, you really don't have to worry about all those fancy damage bonuses of your positionals.
[1:29:17] <+TheDestinyPotato> @Pallion_ NIN has 3
[1:29:21] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> lock on is pretty alright
[1:29:21] <Lotharman> I love this option
[1:29:22] <AllenDeadman> HOW?
[1:29:25] <sonofthedeepsouth> Who be healsut in this game?
[1:29:25] <Jdrockefeller> you can max EVERY SINGLE CLASS AND JOB on a single character
[1:29:25] <ColRedyx> Nooooooooooooo! Lock-on is awful!
[1:29:26] <Darkrenai> @xmetalicdemonx You can swap to every job on a single character
[1:29:33] <mikesapartment> You can face away and auto now
[1:29:37] <%Reizie_Etherealm> LOCK ON IS BAD
[1:29:38] <%Venhammer> @xmetalicdemonx You can level every single combat and non-combat class on the same character
[1:29:39] <ssks123> remember when you couldnt lmao
[1:29:40] <+Jay667b> lol
[1:29:42] <$Valdorick> @sonofthedeepsouth White Mages
[1:29:43] <ColRedyx> If you lock on you can't move your camera and you backpedal when you move away. It's terrible.
[1:29:44] <theobble> i member
[1:29:47] <sonofthedeepsouth> thaank you
[1:29:53] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> auto attack working in any direction is a change that saved lives

[1:31:25] <theobble> RDM dps LUL
[1:31:26] <%Reizie_Etherealm> RDM is when you wanna ignore your rotation and your class mechanic and focus on the battle mechanic
[1:31:28] <Carnivoreking> But pat. BLM is the only caster that does damage
[1:31:28] <Monkeyweed21> Pat is a huge coward that runs away from BLM and MNK
[1:31:30] <ColRedyx> Also good BLMs save their triplecasts.
[1:31:30] <hooooooooly_shiiiiiiiiiit> i hate black.... mages
[1:31:31] <inksmears> WHM: the only healer that didn't get fucked in 5.0

[1:33:28] <ColRedyx> Yeah, for the people that haven't tried controller, left and right on the dpad when neither trigger is held selects enemies. Up and down with neither trigger selects party members in the same order they are on your list.
[1:33:30] <%Reizie_Etherealm> There's soft lock, hard lock and camera lock on which is bad
[1:33:31] <%apostateCourier> you're mostly gonna be dpsing you mean :v
[1:33:32] <%MegboyManuel> the best tank skill ever, Passage!!
[1:33:32] <%danpc5> right
[1:33:34] <BunnyEmperor> Wings
[1:33:36] <Monkeyweed21> PLD BEST TANK
[1:33:37] <%Venhammer> @Agami23 You should heal anyone that takes damage but tank gets priority
[1:33:40] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> mention that you had Asylum macro'd maybe
[1:33:43] <%MegboyManuel> "Get behind me!"
[1:33:45] <+WzillNJ> @Agami23 Both
[1:33:46] <TheEvilOmega> Okay, folks, so I'm level 50 now. Finished the main story. Just started unlocking a boatload of dungeons. What's the best way to gear up? Grinding out Castrum for poetics and getting that stuff?
[1:33:51] <%Fenrirlives> @AngriestPat will you update any of this info when Shadow Bringers pops?
[1:33:51] <$valriot> Nah fuck them guys
[1:33:54] <badhaye> heal everyone FOR NOW
[1:33:59] <+enterprise900> NOT ANYMORE FOR SCH
[1:33:59] <theobble> except when the other party wipes LUL
[1:34:00] <BinaryShuffle> Not anymore they don
[1:34:02] <ssks123> just keep leveling @TheEvilOmega
[1:34:04] <+NYCrownlessKing> poetics give u decent gear. then just keep doin story @TheEvilOmega
[1:34:06] <%QuadraticGravity> @TheEvilOmega doing dailies for poetics and picking up Ironworks gear
[1:34:07] <%Venhammer> @TheEvilOmega just keep leveling
[1:34:07] <ssks123> if you have the expansions i mean
[1:34:07] <Covil91> They can deal damage for 1 more month
[1:34:08] <IndoorSitup> NOT FOR LONG
[1:34:08] <HibikiYamada> @Agami23 Priority is yourself, tank, everyone else
[1:34:08] <+Greerhead> rip aero 3
[1:34:09] <blond_e> Until 5.0 :(
[1:34:09] <Helghast102> and healers doing damage is expected of you in this game
[1:34:09] <$valriot> NOT ANYMORE OMEGALUL
[1:34:12] <@mothmandraws> throw rocks
[1:34:12] <$Valdorick> @Agami23 As a long time DPS in many games - Scrub DPS can go fuck them selves, Tank is priority, and good DPS won't need much healing beyond unavoidable damage.
[1:34:12] <ColRedyx> @TheEvilOmega Pay someone to pick up a full set of 115 gear from Ishgard and then continue the MSQ.
[1:34:15] <itsamarshian> you just made the PLD waste divine veil
[1:34:19] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@enterprise900) (warning)
[1:34:22] <Luckster1234> THROW ROCKS
[1:34:24] <%MegboyManuel> that striking dummy is invincible
[1:34:25] <ColRedyx> @TheEvilOmega Are you on Ultros?
[1:34:31] <$valriot> This is what i do instead of healing people
[1:34:34] <Forester_Skippy> stone spam and not healing can be really high dps if you have gear
[1:34:35] <%MegboyManuel> they arent doing any damage to it, look
[1:34:46] <$valriot> YEYEYE PALADIN COMBOS
[1:34:46] <TheEvilOmega> I'm on Siren.
[1:34:47] <BunnyEmperor> @theevilomega literally just jump from one tomestone gear to the next while picking up dungeon gear in between
[1:34:54] <ssks123> he has party damage turned off i think
[1:34:56] <Tucker0603> Paladin best job
[1:34:57] <@Pandora_Prime> >_>
[1:35:12] <TheEvilOmega> Mmkay. Thanks, folks. Been dual leveling Bard and WHM.
[1:35:19] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> yeye I learned this like a month ago after playing this game for 5 years
[1:35:38] <Covil91> I never knew that...
[1:35:42] <ColRedyx> You can also cycle through the enemy list with L1+up and down.
[1:35:43] <+JerseyBleek> PowerUpL TriHard PowerUpR protips!!!
[1:35:45] <%Solshine11> Just play with a touch screen lol
[1:35:47] <@JustinianKnight> Left and right on the dpad also works
[1:35:49] <xmetalicdemonx> Fuck that solves so many problems I had.
[1:35:57] <+ravenrooke> @AngriestPat This is why i quit: I was playing Warrior and I couldnt maintain aggro control on controller
[1:35:57] <@JustinianKnight> and is easier imo
[1:36:01] <ColRedyx> Left and right on the dpad will cycle targets in the order they are on your screen.
[1:36:03] <$valriot> Who?
[1:36:04] <%MegboyManuel> Pat, favourite Class and Outfit
[1:36:04] <Angry_Ev1L> FF14 controller support is LITERALLY the best in the industry
[1:36:11] <%EvilSoully> Horizon?!
[1:36:11] <$Valdorick> But how do I configure my game to play on a Donkey Kong Bongo Controller!?
[1:36:12] <DublinRage> Pat should save this separately from this stream for his YT as a tutorial vid.
[1:36:12] <%yeknomlive> for new healers dont forget you can res in battle
[1:36:13] <ColRedyx> L1+up and down will cycle in the order they are on the enemy list
[1:36:20] <%EvilSoully> *PTSD flashbacks*
[1:36:21] <%MegboyManuel> dammit
[1:36:23] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> How do you have aggro problems on WAR though

You've never had hot dogs until they are cooked on a pitchfork. Glad I got the catch the rest of the FFXIV stream, gotta get those learnings.

[1:38:21] <ShichiNoBushi> No. It died of a heart attack.

[1:38:55] <Guardiansaiyan> !uptime
[1:38:55] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 38m.
[1:38:55] <%Zamorouskiwhich> who mad tho 😠

[1:38:58] <ShichiNoBushi> Like FF12.
[1:39:02] <ssks123> trust me im DRG ;)
[1:39:02] <GarbageQueenEllie> Yes, I'm watching the Big Orange Shit's stream
[1:39:03] <@SSaryn> Hey if you're a BLM, and you stand in it, I hate you.
[1:39:06] <Guardiansaiyan> doesn't have to tell time! Yes!
[1:39:06] <+Qsmash_> definitely don't stand in 9 of those at the same time like I did
[1:39:07] <haveswordmuststing> stand in fire, DPS higher
[1:39:07] <Captain_Joe1911> hello @Guardiansaiyan :)
[1:39:08] <DetroitSentai> Healers adjust
[1:39:10] <$valriot> HUH HOW scarfD scarfD
[1:39:11] <itsamarshian> can you please tell people to not pull with provoke?
[1:39:11] <%EvilSoully> I am a Dragoon, and know that what Pat is saying is lies
[1:39:11] <@mothmandraws> healers will fix it
[1:39:12] <%Swampykins> Unless you're in a leyline.
[1:39:12] <Monkeyweed21> just tell healers to adjust
[1:39:13] <theobble> you don't pay my sub
[1:39:13] <Guardiansaiyan> @Captain_Joe1911 hello
[1:39:13] <johnny2by4x6> adjust
[1:39:13] <Derkinstacker> Unless you're a BLM and you just stand in it because damage.
[1:39:14] <helpmeimafruit> no but moving means less dps so its the healers fault Kappa
[1:39:16] <Calek> just stay in it that's what healers are for Kappa
[1:39:16] <%Wonderbot3000> unless you're dragoon than soak up all the aoe
[1:39:17] <%spiritofmojave> Healer adjust to standing
[1:39:17] <%Gogogolem> Get out 2017
[1:39:18] <@SSaryn> @mothmandraws I WILL NOT.
[1:39:19] <DetroitSentai> or use CDs, BLM has manaward for a reason
[1:39:20] <Forester_Skippy> if you are a black mage and use those leylines IT WILL target you
[1:39:20] <+Tolvan> healers adjust
[1:39:21] <xmetalicdemonx> It took me a while to learn that you have to unlock to run faster.
[1:39:22] <blackbeaking> that's wrong pat, that orange circle screams stand in it
[1:39:24] <%walternatorz> what about the orange shit in the bottom left?
[1:39:25] <Finaldragoon> don't get server ticked
[1:39:25] <moogleboy1984> Hey, if you're not a BLM, don't be near my dance floor, thanks
[1:39:25] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@Fenrirlives) (warning)
[1:39:27] <$valriot> Literally AT END GAME people cannot avoid SHIT
[1:39:30] <troytaco> if theres lag it still hits you
[1:39:33] <Jdrockefeller> castbar is all that counts
[1:39:35] <$Valdorick> That circle is known in many groups as "Healer problems" just stand it in, your DPS is more important Kappa
[1:39:44] <Monkeyweed21> you stand in it if you're BLM
[1:39:44] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat Pat why aren't you a lalofel ?
[1:39:47] <AdmiralButtloaf> its based on the cast bar
[1:39:52] <%vaporousTippler> It's why healers have group heals.
[1:39:53] <BunnyEmperor> getting fire4 off is more important than moving out aoes LUL
[1:39:53] <moogleboy1984> I got Manaward
[1:39:57] <@mothmandraws> dab on the boss
[1:39:57] <theobble> Sometimes there's some aoes are persistant :)
[1:39:58] <%Arnschen> Hey, BLU
[1:40:00] <%a_lucky_soul> You would think that was obvious
[1:40:04] <%Agami23> remember that one boss that actively tricks you with those? fun
[1:40:06] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> a lot of ARR attacks are obtuse but yeah youll learn
[1:40:08] <%Arnschen> They die
[1:40:12] <%shawntk_> @Valdorick Listen, the boss is almost dead, if I just stand in it I'm sure it'll be dead before it casts i- FUCK
[1:40:13] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Selecting a target without pressing x to confirm is a soft lock, pressing x is hard lock. If you have already have hard lock target then a soft lock will use only one skill on that target before selecting the hard lock target again, just an FYI
[1:40:16] <%kujofire990> @mothmandraws you mean /dab at the boss
[1:40:17] <helpmeimafruit> he kicc
[1:40:20] <Derkinstacker> Gonna switch that kick for interupt soon.
[1:40:22] <ColRedyx> Something new players REALLY need to know that's not obvious is the desync between target locking and damage. You can run back into abilities before they appear to go off and not take damage if you were out when they locked targets, and vice versa.
[1:40:25] <%spiritofmojave> I just saw the weird spinning mechanic AoE this patch and it threw me tf off
[1:40:28] <Oleai> Just run Bardam's Mettle on stream, Pat. Because for some reason the raid mechanic tutorial boss is in a mid-tier dungeon from two expansions in.
[1:40:38] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat Pat no Dragoons are awful
[1:40:38] <%Bane_Kaikyo> @AngriestPat HO Do KIKK tho?
[1:40:47] <theobble> Didn't you already build a drg hotbar?
[1:40:58] <%Arnschen> Yeah, Bardam is great for teaching mechanics
[1:40:58] <KatabolicRage> guess he's doing it again for our benefit
[1:41:01] <ColRedyx> Well RIP lol
[1:41:02] <$valriot> Put Fell Cleave on every slot
[1:41:06] <%spiritofmojave> Heavy Thrust Jebaited
[1:41:08] <Guardiansaiyan> Needs more Redbull DrinkPurple On this stream
[1:41:09] <Derkinstacker> Surprised pats mind goblins aren't acting up
[1:41:09] <@mothmandraws> pat what dungeon should I run
[1:41:09] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> why not just use spare hotbars?
[1:41:22] <ColRedyx> Could have just copied and cleared those.
[1:41:24] <ItsAGundamu> !uptime
[1:41:24] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 41m.
[1:41:24] <$Valdorick> Okay but real talk - BLMs, you have Scathe for a reason, stop casting fucking Fire IV and just move and Scathe (if the circle is so large that you'll go through a large portion of your GCD before you can plant feet again)
[1:41:26] <Guardiansaiyan> @Derkinstacker they were here the whole time
[1:41:28] <BappoSama> HAT GIRL FOR SMASH!!!!!!
[1:41:29] <%SirKamBam> I actually need this info
[1:41:30] <FairOnFire> yo chat what was the text for the sprint macro on R3?
[1:41:30] <%Unlimited_> @mothmandraws satasha until you die
[1:41:31] <ItsAGundamu> oh cool just started
[1:41:34] <DublinRage> what are the icons on the side of the hotbar?
[1:41:40] <$valriot> @valdorick Scathe is fucking shit
[1:41:44] <@SSaryn> Piercing Talon Kappa
[1:41:47] <%Solshine11> @angriestpat do you know how to cope with the loss of losing a mount loot roll with a 92? Because I sure as fuck don’t.
[1:41:51] <+Tolvan> scathe? more like dps loss
[1:41:51] <@mothmandraws> which one dublin
[1:41:56] <%Keyd00d> these buttons are your life
[1:41:58] <%apostateCourier> Heavy thrust is getting THE FUCK OUT
[1:41:59] <theobble> Yes, you will always be using impulse drive and heavy thrust :)
[1:42:04] <BlueLunecy> HT is rip in ShB innit?
[1:42:06] <xmetalicdemonx> Whats that shit on the side of the hotbar? Are they just active buffs?
[1:42:09] <ColRedyx> FYI guys, you can copy hotbars with "/hotbar copy LNC 1 DRG 1" for example. The first job abbreviation and number is the source, the second is the destination. /chotbar for controller hotbars.
[1:42:15] <DonovynN> heavy thrust is dead thank god
[1:42:22] <+titans_ace_jerid> I swear to God.
[1:42:25] <AdmiralButtloaf> no, vorpal thrust is gone
[1:42:26] <DonovynN> its built in to the combo
[1:42:27] <ColRedyx> @xmetalicdemonx Pat's system of cooldown tracking.
[1:42:28] <BunnyEmperor> Diversion, pre Shadowbringers ofc
[1:42:33] <haveswordmuststing> @xmetalicdemonx cooldowns, buffs have a different icon
[1:42:33] <+titans_ace_jerid> The "Healer Problems" jokes hurt.
[1:42:36] <%Solshine11> apatWrong eventually
[1:42:40] <AdmiralButtloaf> heavy thrust is the opener for both comost now
[1:42:43] <@mothmandraws> they are other skills not commonly used, so he gotta do button imputs to access
[1:42:47] <$valriot> BLM is Pog, people just dont know how to stutter cast cos people who play this game as gakaxy brain dingbats
[1:42:48] <DublinRage> @mothmandraws nvm they are cooldowns i think
[1:42:48] <AdmiralButtloaf> no nvm heavy thrust is gone
[1:42:52] <HibikiYamada> @titans_ace_jerid "jokes" :(
[1:42:57] <DonovynN> its gone its buff isnt tho
[1:42:57] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> heavy thrust is gona and true thrust is used for chaos thrust and full thrust combo
[1:42:59] <%spiritofmojave> @titans_ace_jerid my WHM now knows who to sparingly heal :)
[1:43:01] <ColRedyx> Cooldown* not cast time.
[1:43:05] <%Reizie_Etherealm> @DublinRage Those skills are on a custom hot bar and are only there to show the availability of the skill, whether it's on cooldown or ready to be used etc.
[1:43:10] <%QuadraticGravity> you only cast Blood of the Dragon like once or twice per fight
[1:43:21] <MultipleJiggs> How long has Pat been just talking about the game's UI and his controller layout?
[1:43:22] <AdmiralButtloaf> right true thrust
[1:43:26] <+Angrec> what spear skin is that he is using
[1:43:33] <xmetalicdemonx> @ColRedyx Alright now im even more confused, whats cooldown tracking?
[1:43:34] <DublinRage> @Reizie_Etherealm oh... that makes sense thank you
[1:43:39] <+smevvster> Looks like the Shire spear
[1:43:39] <%QuadraticGravity> @Angrec looks like shire
[1:43:40] <ColRedyx> @MultipleJiggs As long as it merits talking about.
[1:43:46] <theobble> I've never played this game on pad I have no idea
[1:43:59] <Analogflame> I've only used keyboard for this game
[1:44:01] <$valriot> Trash opener, grey numbers omegalul
[1:44:03] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> its a 30s cd too
[1:44:03] <$Valdorick> Also, yeah, because I doubt we're seeing this from Pat, casters - the last .3 seconds of your spell are already done on the server side, you can move (depending on latency, of course); find your stutter window, and fucking move after casts.
[1:44:04] <Jdrockefeller> you can maintain blood of the dragon forever if you keep up the rotation
[1:44:06] <%QuadraticGravity> No it's important, you just cast it once or twice because of duration extension
[1:44:11] <+Angrec> @QuadraticGravity thanks!
[1:44:13] <%Solshine11> @angriestpat don’t forget Life Surge before every Full Thrust
[1:44:20] <TerryTheTurret> @AngriestPat You don't use W-Bar?
[1:44:22] <%Reizie_Etherealm> That's why I use double press on the trigger instead
[1:44:23] <%a_lucky_soul> I'm still gonna stick with KBaM
[1:44:23] <%Mawarup> Mawarup subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 16 months! Thanks Pat for all the content! Started XIV around Feb and now I'm coming close to the end of SB. What grand time it is in Hydalen. Keep it up
[1:44:25] <ColRedyx> @xmetalicdemonx Certain skills can't just be spammed all the time, when you use them they become unavailable for a while. Since Pat's setup doesn't show his second hotbar at all times, he needs another place to put that button so he can see how long before they're ready again.
[1:44:26] <Jdrockefeller> you would use it only to extend timer or reapply if boss becomes invincible
[1:44:34] <%Solshine11> I went to long without knowing to do that...
[1:44:35] <Guardiansaiyan> @Mawarup congrats
[1:44:35] <$valriot> Best moves
[1:44:36] <TerryTheTurret> Ah okay
[1:44:49] <%kiiiirsten> When the MMO isn't WoW ResidentSleeper
[1:44:51] <xmetalicdemonx> @ColRedyx oh ok thats cool thanks
[1:44:55] <+Risingxiv> @AngriestPat you can enter and leave the house to break aggro faster
[1:44:55] <%Reizie_Etherealm> The WXHB is the shit
[1:44:58] <+smevvster> WoW ResidentSleeper
[1:45:01] <@mothmandraws> Pats when ff14 classic
[1:45:04] <%kiiiirsten> @smevvster Don't you judge me
[1:45:07] <%apostateCourier> oh jeez doin drg opener wrong
[1:45:11] <Angry_Ev1L> fuck WoW
[1:45:20] <BappoSama> @AngriestPat Quick question in terms of the different jobs: Are they all level locked or are there some that require to be at a certain point in the game overall?
[1:45:22] <%spiritofmojave> WoW doesn't have my Au-Ra boy
[1:45:22] <%kiiiirsten> @Angry_Ev1L Don't you judge me either!
[1:45:23] <$valriot> Man, FFXIV Classic would be fuckin dogshit
[1:45:30] <@mothmandraws> I know id love it
[1:45:32] <+smevvster> Sad when the most exciting thing in your MMO is like a 15 year reversion
[1:45:33] <@mothmandraws> let me see the jank
[1:45:36] <ssks123> I have a friend who unironically thinks 1.0 was better
[1:45:37] <Angry_Ev1L> @kiiiirsten You did it to yourself!
[1:45:38] <ssks123> he is wrong
[1:45:50] <%kiiiirsten> Disclaimer: I am fully aware that WoW is dogshit HOWEVER! I love it and that makes it valid
[1:45:56] <scoan> ff11 classic
[1:45:57] <ColRedyx> @BappoSama Level locked? Most classes you can pick to start as but all the expansion classes require reaching at least level 50 to unlock.
[1:45:58] <%apostateCourier> even with the tools he has he's doing it wrong
[1:45:59] <$valriot> Sure think, grey logs Kappa
[1:46:00] <%QuadraticGravity> Oh, that explains no mirage dive.
[1:46:04] <%Mythicalbrit> @ssks123 your friend is insane
[1:46:09] <haveswordmuststing> @bapposama Dark knight, Samurai, any of the jobs that have a lvl 50 quest to unlock them
[1:46:20] <theobble> Show new melee dps what true north does
[1:46:23] <@mothmandraws> I dont think the exact details of the combo matters in this stream
[1:46:29] <%apostateCourier> (blood of the dragon gets popped before you hit any damage button)
[1:46:33] <+Ell1ot> but i want to make big explosions
[1:46:36] <Analogflame> style is always important
[1:46:37] <Covil91> No looking pretty is the most important thing.
[1:46:37] <Analogflame> Kappa
[1:46:40] <Angry_Ev1L> 1.0 was a fucking dogshit with almost no redeemable qualities
[1:46:41] <%Fidranth> true north is for cowards
[1:46:50] <$Yakobro> goodbye dark arts!
[1:46:51] <%AquilaHarukaze> Not for long
[1:46:51] <%kiiiirsten> Someone talk me out of buying WoW classic in....August? I think? cause I"m already thinking about buying a desktop just so I can Do That
[1:46:53] <$valriot> Nah, im an Ice Mage Kappa Kappa @angriestpat
[1:46:54] <hooooooooly_shiiiiiiiiiit> D A R K A R T S
[1:46:57] <Finaldragoon> Press F for Dark Arts
[1:46:59] <%kiiiirsten> Even though WotLK was the best xpac
[1:46:59] <%Arnschen> RIP Dark Arts
[1:47:01] <+Tolvan> f
[1:47:01] <Besadon> F
[1:47:03] <$valriot> ITS AWFUL
[1:47:07] <BappoSama> @haveswordmuststing Well, that's kind of a bummer, but I guess it makes sense.
[1:47:07] <TerryTheTurret> @BappoSama Basically the expansion jobs you can't choose when you create a character.
[1:47:08] <%AquilaHarukaze> RIP Darts
[1:47:10] <+smevvster> Good riddance
[1:47:10] <Forester_Skippy> you press it on everything but 2 attacks in your normal combos
[1:47:11] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> god DRK is so busy
[1:47:11] <%Mythicalbrit> "dark arts is the singular most pressed button" fixed that for you Pat
[1:47:12] <$valriot> BWEEEEEWWW
[1:47:14] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@BlitzNeidhart) (warning)
[1:47:25] <ColRedyx> Basically, what pat's saying is that you don't want to be juggling triggers constantly.
[1:47:34] <%Reizie_Etherealm> My preference is GCD on face buttons cause those are the main combo skills and OGCD on the d-pad cause you don't use them that often and that's harder to press on the fly
[1:47:35] <$valriot> Didnt even do Bloodspiller SMH
[1:47:37] <ColRedyx> You want to have buttons that are often used together placed together.
[1:47:37] <%apostateCourier> And I know it's not super important atm but giving pat shit for being bad is 90% of the fun here :v
[1:47:38] <%yeknomlive> did pat teach everyone about clipping gcd?
[1:47:49] <+smevvster> I can't [Dark Arts] wait for [Dark Arts] for them to [Dark Arts] remove [Dark Arts] Dark Arts.
[1:47:51] <Angry_Ev1L> will balance discord dunk on you if you're bad?
[1:47:54] <theobble> Scourge BibleThump
[1:47:57] <%BlitzNeidhart> Countdown until Dark Arts will finally be gone: 26 days
[1:47:59] <ColRedyx> @Reizie_Etherealm Yeah that's exactly how I do it too.
[1:48:01] <%AquilaHarukaze> I've been playing for over a year and I still don't fully understand clipping
[1:48:07] <$DarkKnightGrave> LANCER~
[1:48:07] <@mothmandraws> I dont even have disembowl yet
[1:48:09] <@mothmandraws> feels bad
[1:48:13] <Lotharman> Missing Life Surge
[1:48:15] <BappoSama> So it's basically like picking a fighet, ranger, thief, or wizard then branching off to the super high class shit after you've gained enough experience.
[1:48:18] <$SleepyMaribo> where do i go for that macro setting?
[1:48:22] <@mothmandraws> I only just got full trhust
[1:48:29] <$valriot> Man, i cant believe Flash is dead in 5.0, RIP
[1:48:30] <ColRedyx> Noooooooooo, I wouldn't agree with that.
[1:48:35] <@mothmandraws> I pop life surge for my baby crits
[1:48:38] <Angry_Ev1L> Flash Kappa
[1:48:46] <theobble> @mothmandraws don't give up , skeleton
[1:48:51] <haveswordmuststing> @bapposama theres the basic Classes which upgrade into Jobs with a new mechanic and more than double the moves
[1:48:52] <%QuadraticGravity> Full Thrust feels so good when you finally get it
[1:48:52] <Covil91> Look at Pat disrespecting Piercing Talon
[1:48:53] <ColRedyx> If you build up muscle memory for a skill being in one place, it's going to be harder to adapt than just setting up your bars the right way first.
[1:48:54] <Angry_Ev1L> PAL looks OP as fuck for no reason AGAIN in 5.0... when will square learn
[1:48:56] <@mothmandraws> soon ill poke strong
[1:48:59] <$valriot> Total Eclipse feels awful to pull aggro with
[1:49:00] <AdmiralButtloaf> impulse drive is pointless until lvl 36 lol
[1:49:02] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> Make sure you tell people Heavy Thrust is gone in ShB
[1:49:02] <%spiritofmojave> @bapposama That's about right!
[1:49:05] <AngryPhant0m> Balance link?
[1:49:08] <+Silentman0> ff14 has a way better new player experience/difficulty curve than other mmos
[1:49:15] <metrying> This game is so good
[1:49:16] <daedri> To be DRK is to suffer.
[1:49:22] <katocrimson> Just tuned in. How is Pat sensei's teachings?
[1:49:24] <ColRedyx> If you're really serious, check a guide and learn how your job works and set up your bar in advance so that you don't have to rebuild your muscle memory.
[1:49:31] <Finaldragoon> Role actions are leaving in a month
[1:49:31] <BappoSama> @haveswordmuststing I wonder why that is..I'm not bothered by it though.
[1:49:32] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Adjust your hotbar and your skills according to your usage of them, whatever you prefer, whatever makes you comfortable

A non-ff related question tho: Have you heard of Outer Wilds? It's a cool space exploration zelda-esque game that I think you might like! Check it out!
[1:49:37] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> Read Trait tooltips too!
[1:49:39] <Angry_Ev1L> @katocrimson decent actually
[1:49:40] <Neoripo> DRG lvl opener: Heavy thrust-> Impulse drive- (start of rotations)
[1:49:46] <+Qsmash_> I was cycling befween 3 hotbars in fights with one bar being misc things NotLikeThis
[1:49:50] <%yeknomlive> mercy stroke BibleThump
[1:49:50] <Covil91> Role actions are staying. Just different
[1:49:53] <$valriot> YEAH, THEY DO
[1:49:57] <haveswordmuststing> @bapposama because youre more busy learning a role early game than your class
[1:49:58] <%Fidel_Castbro> Take Goad you asshole

[1:50:12] <%kiiiirsten> I would like to say fuck this chat cause not ONE of you told me not to buy WoW Classic and therefore you are all enablers
[1:50:14] <Forester_Skippy> not feint as a tank main pat WTF?
[1:50:15] <+Noponiz> feint is literally the most important one of those
[1:50:20] <%Reizie_Etherealm> @Qsmash_ You can set it so that the misc hot bar can't be cycled in combat
[1:50:26] <+smevvster> Pat is non-goading scum
[1:50:28] <+Tolvan> @kiiiirsten don't buy wow classic
[1:50:30] <@mothmandraws> btw does 2nd wind ever improve its heal or is it locked to 500 heal
[1:50:35] <%spiritofmojave> Goad is a Monk's best friendo now
[1:50:36] <%kiiiirsten> @Tolvan Try and stop me!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[1:50:36] <%Lapinelis> Damn man, you're real fast going through menus

[1:50:40] <Angry_Ev1L> LUL
[1:50:41] <%a_lucky_soul> ALSO let the tank get in position before using positionals because that can screw you up.
[1:50:43] <Neoripo> Feint is better the true north
[1:50:44] <+Noponiz> why do you hate reducing feint damage
[1:50:49] <Forester_Skippy> i ment as a tank main you would apreciate if someone used it @AngriestPat
[1:50:50] <@SSaryn> Same thing with Arm's Length.. but not for Ranged.
[1:50:50] <TerryTheTurret> @BappoSama Yeah that's why the newer jobs are unlocked as jobs rather than classes immediately, even the devs realized it's weird.
[1:50:50] <%spiritofmojave> LUL
[1:50:51] <+Noponiz> i mean raid damage
[1:50:51] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> I think Feint is staying?
[1:50:51] <BappoSama> @haveswordmuststing I play too much TERA. All the badass shit in there you can get super early aside from i think 1.
[1:50:53] <%kiiiirsten> If I wanna play WoW again I gotta get a desktop again and that's effort. I'm a casual console bitch and that's how I like it.
[1:50:53] <Angry_Ev1L> Is it going away? Addle is still in LUL
[1:50:54] <+Qsmash_> @Reizie_Etherealm Yeah, I'm learning a lot this stream
[1:50:55] <+Bad1uck> @mothmandraws It scales with level, the potency is 500
[1:50:55] <ColRedyx> It's really important that you keep the same function in the same area so your skill can transfer smoothly between classes.
[1:50:56] <meteor530> FREAK OUT!
[1:50:56] <%yeknomlive> you dont pay his sub >:(
[1:50:58] <zepelinnn> you still spent years not goading coward

[1:52:10] <Finaldragoon> Maelstrom for life
[1:52:11] <+max_byer> are there any instances where youd want to completely replay a combo in your hotbar with a better version of the same thing? sorry if that was already addressed that.

[1:52:14] <+barkon345> God I Love the worlds in this game
[1:52:17] <transporterthesequel> So, Maelstrom
[1:52:18] <ColRedyx> @Reizie_Etherealm THIS! Turn off all other hotbars in combat but 1 and use extended hold and WXHB. Hotbar cycling is for losers.

[1:55:08] <+Rose_Silver> @Bad1uck not anymore, just logging out at any city gives you rested exp now
[1:55:10] <ssks123> show hildy
[1:55:11] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> the thing i dont like about the unending journey is that it doesnt have ALL the cutscenes, just the fancy ones
[1:55:12] <BappoSama> @AngriestPat Are those also level locked?
[1:55:13] <$Valdorick> So many spoilers Kappa
[1:55:15] <%spiritofmojave> Yep you can skip most everything and have movie night if you wanted
[1:55:16] <Tucker0603> IMMORTAL FLAMES
[1:55:20] <%Reizie_Etherealm> MONTHS worth of cutscenes
[1:55:21] <Huntercd> Where are the sexy ladies? @AngriestPat
[1:55:23] <ColRedyx> These aren't even all the cutscenes by the way. Quests with multiple cutscenes are combined into one quest listing, and a lot of those categories had dropdowns.
[1:55:27] <ColRedyx> There is SO MUCH PLOT in 14.
[1:55:27] <+Bad1uck> I thought it was recovered at a higher rate but wasn't required anymore
[1:55:27] <+thundiedramon> you can also watch side quest cutscenes and job quest ones if you want
[1:55:28] <%kiiiirsten> Shit YOu Don't Want

[1:57:08] <%yeknomlive> thant's the standard. sometimes they have sales at least
[1:57:08] <theobble> You do get free fantasia.
[1:57:09] <%tyler274> ARR gives you one free race change
[1:57:11] <Monkeyweed21> Why doesn't Pat play lalafell
[1:57:11] <Xelhesia> 10 dollars for fantasia
[1:57:12] <$valriot> Its terrible
[1:57:13] <+Justlaxy> I got the free fantasia from the 30 days
[1:57:13] <+krispen_wa> Pay Square 10 dollars for a Race Change sounds like a podcast title

[1:57:13] <Analogflame> How do u get so much gil btw? Do u just end up with alot end game
[1:57:14] <Forester_Skippy> after beating the level 50 main story you get 1 time use race change

[1:57:27] <$valriot> It doesnt even work half the time
[1:57:31] <DublinRage> Someone should start an email to the BeastCast as "Dear Bigger and Baldur"
[1:57:32] <+Zepshire> we going into glamour plates
[1:57:37] <+Rose_Silver> @Nina96 if you have the expansions then yes
[1:57:38] <%shawntk_> @Nina96 Some require you to have bought an expansion, but otherwise yes
[1:57:38] <metrying> @Nina96 yeah you can be an elf, a human and a dwarf thing
[1:57:48] <haveswordmuststing> @nina96 some races are expansion only
[1:57:49] <AllenDeadman> pat's character looking like iskandar
[1:57:50] <ColRedyx> @AngriestPat SUPER important tip for saving Glamour Dresser space and not having to dump old items. The Armoire is infinite storage space for items it can accept (one-of-a-kind event items usually). Anything in it is accessible by the glamour dresser, so ALWAYS deposit in the Armoire first.
[1:57:53] <Darkrenai> @AngriestPat What top is that for the samurai, that's a pretty sick top
[1:57:55] <Finaldragoon> Glamour is the true endgame
[1:57:56] <+ryujinran> dont you get an appearance change potion for free in msq?
[1:58:01] <$DarkKnightGrave> THE SHIT'S SHIT

[1:58:11] <+Rose_Silver> @ryujinran you do! after completeting ARR msq you get a free fantasia
[1:58:12] <helpmeimafruit> it's a super eyepatch
[1:58:20] <Monkeyweed21> on a wolf
[1:58:22] <Analogflame> woah its like the vanity slot in terraria
[1:58:22] <+krispen_wa> every game should have this kind of system
[1:58:22] <+Tolvan> honestly I need like 20 plates
[1:58:28] <%walternatorz> em examines you
[1:58:32] <2DSuperiority> Hopefully we get triple the space in ShB
[1:58:33] <%Reizie_Etherealm> MAGNUM OPUS
[1:58:34] <%AquilaHarukaze> I can't believe he's talking about endgame content already
[1:58:36] <metrying> Is this game easier to play on controller?
[1:58:37] <Derkinstacker> LOOK AT IT!
[1:58:37] <ColRedyx> They're adding more plates and more dresser storage in Shadowbringers.
[1:58:37] <@SSaryn> Get the glowy bits off
[1:58:38] <%kiiiirsten> fusG
[1:58:39] <+Dessbocito2> Pog
[1:58:42] <$valriot> Take the shit effect off
[1:58:43] <KatabolicRage> it's important to note the glamour dresser is an additional thing on top of the basic system of "make one thing look like another by spending a prism"
[1:58:44] <midnightmile> SOul edge
[1:58:46] <Tucker0603> it's fucking rad

[2:03:57] <Angry_Ev1L> SHow some COOL fucking shit instead of goddamn sastasha... what are you doing
[2:03:58] <Monkeyweed21> Remember to talk to Avere and Edda in front

[2:04:00] <$valriot> Pup
[2:04:05] <metrying> @AngriestPat is this better on controller or is it your preference?
[2:04:10] <%MegboyManuel> big dick mount
[2:04:18] <%a_lucky_soul> hehe duty
[2:04:18] <DublinRage> How does one get that cool PUPPER?

[2:04:35] <$Valdorick> Mothman doesn't have time to get more dances, he's busy dabbing on his enemy's corpses with his sick DPS >.>
[2:04:36] <ColRedyx> @metrying It will always be preference, but I also strongly prefer controller, even on PC, even as someone that has played years of WoW.
[2:04:42] <%Arnschen> Oh wow, really?
[2:04:43] <+thundiedramon> @DublinRage Extreme Primal fight from Stormblood
[2:04:46] <Xelhesia> aw doggo whine
[2:04:46] <HeadsHeldHigh> sprouties
[2:04:47] <ColRedyx> @metrying Controller is just SO much more comfortable. WAY more comfortable.
[2:04:47] <$Yakobro> DO THIS
[2:04:48] <%SirKamBam> Where is your mount Action?
[2:04:49] <$valriot> SCRUB LAND
[2:04:51] <@SSaryn> That's accurate.
[2:04:51] <+HoboCabs> D:
[2:04:52] <AllenDeadman> ... it does?
[2:04:53] <Covil91> The game very sadly does not require nearly enough of this
[2:04:53] <%kiiiirsten> LUL
[2:04:54] <$DarkKnightGrave> LUL
[2:04:54] <theobble> It is worth it to do this. You get a lot of very good rewards.
[2:04:54] <Nordguy> you HAVE to? dang
[2:04:54] <+thundiedramon> All Extreme Primal fights drop mounts
[2:04:55] <Monkeyweed21> especially pat
[2:04:56] <%MegboyManuel> LOL
[2:04:56] <thelaxinator> DPS are still shit
[2:04:57] <%cvp5127> Kappa
[2:04:58] <$KnivesEve> this is new
[2:04:58] <DKDiamantes> Truth hurts man
[2:04:59] <MaeMae94> I did this, ITS VERY USEFUL
[2:05:00] <%Arnschen> That's awesome, I'm glad they changed that
[2:05:00] <+thundiedramon> but the chances are low
[2:05:00] <KatabolicRage> hall of the novice is worth doing even if your a vet with some unleveled classes, you get a xp ring out of it and a free set of level 15 gear
[2:05:00] <%AquilaHarukaze> I forgot that the hall of the novice was an actual location
[2:05:00] <+DrunkenDice> it's true spekelFeels
[2:05:02] <%PanicSwytch> Noobs
[2:05:02] <+frostyfromage> D:

[2:05:11] <%Linearlinera> LUL
[2:05:11] <flubber3d> git on their level
[2:05:13] <%kiiiirsten> This message brought to you by the Shit Gang
[2:05:13] <+ravenrooke> @AngriestPat As a tank, is holding L2 and using L1 the way you recommend selecting the enemy with the lowest aggro to top it off again?
[2:05:13] <Forester_Skippy> do this its a level 15 tutorial chain and it reward sarmor thats a strong as level 20 dungeon armor
[2:05:14] <%Reizie_Etherealm> It's not required to do the whole thing, but I think it's required you're made aware that this thing exist by talking to them at least once
[2:05:15] <$valriot> @angriestpat Theyre still shit, level 70 Ice Mages RIP
[2:05:16] <metrying> @Silentman0 @ColRedyx cool thank you guys. I got to level 13 and my back is killing me on key/mouse. Never thought about plugging in the controller
[2:05:19] <TheNocturnalScotsman> exp ring too for beating it
[2:05:21] <+ryujinran> ah yes the place that gives some of the best early game glamour
[2:05:22] <helpmeimafruit> Tank Healman
[2:05:23] <transporterthesequel> ARR launch repRESENT
[2:05:24] <Forester_Skippy> and a ring that works til llevel 30 that gives bonus exp
[2:05:24] <%Voidwyvern> @Kenori no need to transfer long as you log in with same info
[2:05:28] <ColRedyx> @Kenori You don't need to. Just buy the game on PS4 and register the code you get to the account you already have.
[2:05:29] <%Arnschen> What's up with that music...?
[2:05:39] <+alcieta> LUL
[2:05:40] <+Silentman0> @metrying i personally use kb/m because of muscle memory but they both work perfectly well
[2:05:41] <$Valdorick> Ice BLM are best mages Kappa
[2:05:41] <ColRedyx> @Kenori You won't need to transfer, you'll be able to log in from either system.
[2:05:41] <%Reaped_Psyche> Reaped_Psyche subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months, currently on a 4 month streak! Playing WoW for 15ish years, I find it hard to swap/focus my time on FF14 instead. But, I think it's just sunken cost BS. Your tutorial is awesome and really making me reconsider. Have a great time with Shadow Bringers and I can't wait for more FF14.
[2:05:42] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Cafe music
[2:05:43] <%ArcanumMBD> You get some cool armor for doing these too
[2:05:44] <+Laxriu> @Kenori i believe its the same account but you need to buy the game again
[2:05:48] <%MegboyManuel> why is music scuffed??
[2:05:49] <Finaldragoon> SourPls
[2:05:52] <+cephaloboss> 'too many of you people were shit' cool exactly the reason ive been afraid to play any mmo ever lol thanks
[2:05:55] <@mothmandraws> more importantly
[2:05:55] <DKDiamantes> You also get some cool shite for doing it
[2:05:56] <%Nobrev> SourPls
[2:05:57] <theobble> SourPls
[2:05:57] <$DarkKnightGrave> Huh. Nice. I like this.
[2:05:58] <%yeknomlive> ff2 hype
[2:05:58] <@mothmandraws> they give you dope gear
[2:06:01] <+SeriousCreeper> also has the best background music
[2:06:03] <%kiiiirsten> @cephaloboss ikr LOL
[2:06:03] <+metalsiren31> They give you crazy good armor
[2:06:03] <KatabolicRage> you also get an xp ring
[2:06:04] <@mothmandraws> I was wearing the lancer set
[2:06:06] <%valkuma> I've been MMO'ing for 15 years i think i can skip the training
[2:06:06] <@mothmandraws> just died
[2:06:10] <+metalsiren31> And Brand New Ring
[2:06:11] <+mik255> great music
[2:06:11] <$Yakobro> @MegboyManuel refresh? it might be the twitch thing where sound gets funky if it buffers
[2:06:11] <garbageheaphound> the armor also looks awesome
[2:06:11] <%Reizie_Etherealm> The most important part of this thing is that it gives you DECENT gear
[2:06:13] <indig0bird> The Brand-New set is also cool looking
[2:06:13] <Monkeyweed21> foestriker tabard is bae
[2:06:13] <AllenDeadman> well I sure as hell didn't do that :)
[2:06:15] <%Leodude> I don't think I've heard this music, hot damn, this shit good.
[2:06:16] <Notsocleveruser> SourPls
[2:06:18] <%Deathofgho> that brand new set can carry you up to lvl 25-30 easily
[2:06:18] <DKDiamantes> There's literally no reason not to do it
[2:06:20] <jay521> @AngriestPat is it possible to play through this game solo?
[2:06:21] <ColRedyx> @metrying Oh yeah, I was developing RSI from raiding in WoW. I'm never going back. A regular ass Xbox One controller will do you just fine on PC.
[2:06:21] <thelaxinator> It's all about the Brand New Ring. +30%XP for all classes under 30
[2:06:23] <Analogflame> I didn't do that. god dammit
[2:06:28] <Monkeyweed21> SHOW US THE SUBLIGAR
[2:06:28] <@SSaryn> Eyyyyyyyy DK
[2:06:28] <xmetalicdemonx> That dialogue takes forever.
[2:06:28] <dickbuttwoman> @cephaloboss For what it's worse, people are still too shit even after this thing is out. People are just shit. It's okay to be shit. We live and we learn.
[2:06:29] <%Kenori> does anyone know how to transfer a PC account to a Ps4?
[2:06:31] <%shawntk_> @valkuma You still get really good armor out of it
[2:06:32] <+Silentman0> the brand new gear is honestly gorgeous and the ring is incredibly useful
[2:06:33] <$valriot> Show Omega so we can listen to his stupid song
[2:06:35] <DKDiamantes> @SSaryn Ayyyyye
[2:06:36] <JavaManJoJo> Yo this music is great
[2:06:38] <outis94> great remix
[2:06:42] <ColRedyx> @Kenori We just told you... scroll up.
[2:06:44] <@mothmandraws> all music is great
[2:06:46] <%kujofire990> good times
[2:06:53] <%LegendCobra> this song I love so much
[2:07:00] <Derkinstacker> Seems easy, but you'd be surprised.
[2:07:04] <+Cardz_> Run into the orange
[2:07:05] <@SSaryn> Also yeah, if you don't know, FFXIV has a lot of original tracks that range from decent to FUCKING INCREDIBLE.
[2:07:09] <@mothmandraws> ORANGE MARKER IS LIKE LAMP

[2:07:12] <@mothmandraws> I cant resist
[2:07:14] <%QuadraticGravity> SourPls
[2:07:16] <ColRedyx> @cephaloboss If you're worried about being shit then you have an extremely low probability of being shit. It's the people that don't care that are the problem.
[2:07:17] <%Kenori> alright thats some bullshit I spent like 100 bucks and I cant play it anymore god
[2:07:19] <KatabolicRage> ffxiv got in the guiness book of records for most amount of tracks lol
[2:07:19] <%Bane_Kaikyo> But I LOVE Orange :(
[2:07:20] <+thundiedramon> This theme is the 1.0 battle theme if I remember
[2:07:23] <+BioHunter> except savage says fuck orange markers
[2:07:25] <flubber3d> Stand in the orange?
[2:07:26] <Covil91> Healers adjust! sofiePout
[2:07:26] <$Valdorick> But I have to stand in orange marker, I just put down my Ley Line.
[2:07:26] <+UberWolfman> But im BLM I dont AJUST
[2:07:26] <%Kenori> I was thinking about playing again but that ain happening
[2:07:26] <%Reizie_Etherealm> You'd be amazed by how many people know this but STILL stay in the damn circle thinking they can take it
[2:07:28] <longsilver97> stand in Orange you get exp
[2:07:31] <+Cardz_> Remember if you're a dragoon and you're dead, you're doing your job right
[2:07:37] <%yeknomlive> if you're a blm stay in it for damage
[2:07:40] <%PanicSwytch> Dont stand on orange markers Noobs
[2:07:40] <+Silentman0> you can ignore the actual spell animation as long as you're not standing in the orange when it disappears
[2:07:43] <ColRedyx> @Kenori Did you make a separate account or something? SE support might be able to help you.
[2:07:46] <$Big_Dream> Dragoon's tank the floor
[2:07:47] <@mothmandraws> guys secretly
[2:07:47] <yosukecchi> dead equals 0 dps
[2:07:50] <Monkeyweed21> it's really not
[2:07:52] <@mothmandraws> dragoons get a bonus to their jumps
[2:07:55] <@mothmandraws> if they land in orange
[2:07:58] <DublinRage> So FFXV has an anime prequel, and PSO2 has anime. Any chance we can get a FFXIV anime about the game?
[2:08:03] <$valriot> Wow, you won Pat
[2:08:04] <Angry_Ev1L> But almost all my SMN skills are instant monkaS
[2:08:10] <%valkuma> Stand in Fire, DPS IS HIGHER!

[2:08:15] <%Lapinelis> Dragons are the special, cleaning the floor class
[2:08:17] <metrying> @ColRedyx damn, im definitelly giving the controller a try. Looking at pat's screen, the layout looks great
[2:08:20] <Monkeyweed21> BLM doesn't dodge just yell at healer
[2:08:21] <+TheImmortal70> See you think they're making DRG easier, but in reality it's MUCH harder because you have to time your jumps even more to land in the orange
[2:08:22] <%Kenori> possibly I;ll try that, I have up to Heavensward and I really really do not wanna rebuy all this because my comptuer fucked up
[2:08:22] <ColRedyx> @Kenori You don't have to transfer, just add the PS4 key to the account you already have. Contact SE support and explain to them what's going on, they might be able to help you.
[2:08:25] <%kujofire990> they really are nice
[2:08:29] <Guardiansaiyan> LOVE the Victory Fanfare I am hearing
[2:08:29] <LandOfTheWay> @DublinRage there's no anime, but there is a FFXiV isekai manga
[2:08:32] <flubber3d> sir pat the nerd
[2:08:33] <+Silentman0> @DublinRage there's actual a live action drama based around ff14 about a guy trying to use the game to be friends with his dad
[2:08:36] <KruelDestiny> threw away the gift D:
[2:08:43] <Finaldragoon> @DublinRage there's actually a live action series called 'Dad of Light' that is a retelling of a real life story between a father and son that got into FF14
[2:08:51] <Forester_Skippy> @AngriestPat tell em about the ring you get for doign all of 1 roles serries
[2:08:52] <+cephaloboss> Dad of Light is cute, i just rewatched recently
[2:08:52] <+smevvster> @AngriestPat Pat are you taking advantage of your chocobo saddlebag?
[2:08:59] <Monkeyweed21> MNK

[2:11:19] <Nina96> is it pats class or race as to why his characters huge?
[2:11:19] <haveswordmuststing> since Pat cant help since he's on controller, whats a good hotkey setup
[2:11:24] <Angry_Ev1L> Playing monk in 2k19 Kappa
[2:11:25] <kazedan> MNK is the true master race
[2:11:26] <kazedan> I agree
[2:11:31] <%Leodude> Leodude subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 29 months, currently on a 29 month streak! I have been catching up on CSB Podcasts, but just to let you know on Ep. 5 when Woolie says "The name of the game is Anthem" You saying "Oooppss" is my text ringtone.
[2:11:32] <+Silentman0> @mik255 it sucks! but not enough to get me to stop playing that job
[2:11:36] <+sanoblaze> holla if you a PLD
[2:11:37] <+krispen_wa> does this game have a big stronk story? i only played swtor because it let me fulfill my fantasy of banging everyone as an agent\
[2:11:44] <rekinom> PogChamp
[2:11:44] <%Reizie_Etherealm> PLD!
[2:11:44] <$valriot> HOLLA PLD BOIS
[2:11:47] <%spiritofmojave> thank god MNK getting a bandaid, still moving to RDM tho
[2:11:47] <+Zepshire> pat should do a 24 man to show what it is like
[2:11:48] <Angry_Ev1L> @krispen_wa yes
[2:11:48] <Monkeyweed21> BIG JRPG STORY
[2:11:50] <+thundiedramon> Yes, the story is great. Really slow start though.
[2:11:51] <kazedan> Game has a good story for an MMO
[2:11:52] <rekinom> white knights in chat
[2:11:55] <xmetalicdemonx> When running a dungeon do tanks normally lead? Because I play as a tank and everyone follows me. Unless its someone thats played that dungeon before.
[2:11:59] <$valriot> BIG SHIELD = BIG DIK
[2:12:01] <kazedan> it's not amazing or incredible, but it's good
[2:12:06] <DetroitSentai> ARR is okay, HW is amazing and SB is pretty good
[2:12:06] <%Reizie_Etherealm> But I main RDM u_u
[2:12:07] <%SirKamBam> Ninja gang
[2:12:07] <rekinom> @xmetalicdemonx Yes
[2:12:07] <KatabolicRage> I usually main dragoon but dark knight is pretty tempting for the shadowbringers storyline
[2:12:09] <%VioletHeart> @krispen_wa Story's one of the best parts of the game. It's a bit weak to start but hits huge highs during its first expansion onwards.
[2:12:11] <+thundiedramon> Tanks normally lead but to be fair, anyone can so long as you don't pull for them
[2:12:12] <Monkeyweed21> tanks are the frontline
[2:12:18] <haveswordmuststing> @krispen_wa games story is lower end final fantasy ubtil the expansions where its really good
[2:12:20] <+thundiedramon> I do this a lot as a healer lol
[2:12:21] <LandOfTheWay> Bard Boiz
[2:12:23] <+smevvster> ARR story is pretty forgettable, Heavensward story is pretty great, and the Stormblood story is pretty okay.
[2:12:27] <%yeknomlive> as long as the healer/dps dont pull
[2:12:36] <Angry_Ev1L> ULTIMA is forgettable Kappa yeah sure
[2:12:39] <%Reizie_Etherealm> THE RACE WAR THO
[2:12:39] <+mik255> WAR best tank
[2:12:41] <KatabolicRage> either way, you should observe the ARR story, don't skip that shit man
[2:12:47] <$valriot> Bard is the cuck Job, begging for buffs like some back alley whore
[2:12:48] <Monkeyweed21> Hildibrand is 20/10 best questline ever om any game
[2:12:49] <Angry_Ev1L> shit between ARR and HW is pretty EW
[2:12:50] <@mothmandraws> ARR is pretty fun so far I put down slave rebellion yesterday and stopped a cult
[2:12:54] <%spiritofmojave> ARR is tedious but necessary
[2:12:57] <KatabolicRage> story is a strong point of the game nobodies gonna look kindly on someone who skips everything and then asks what is going on
[2:12:58] <meteor530> What music is this?
[2:13:01] <%spiritofmojave> Even Elf Hell
[2:13:02] <%Reizie_Etherealm> WAR best DPS in tank slot, PLD best actual tank class
[2:13:05] <+smevvster> I mean Ultima and Baelsar were cool, but the actual story itself is a bit of a slog with like 2 hype moments.
[2:13:06] <DetroitSentai> ARR isnt really bad until the postgame before HW
[2:13:06] <+Gamegeneral> I missed start of stream. did pat post his full controller config anywhere
[2:13:08] <Derkinstacker> the last half of ARR is a slog.
[2:13:10] <Monkeyweed21> Massage that supple old man for his pants
[2:13:16] <rekinom> Nothing balance wise matters, expansion is coming soon
[2:13:19] <rekinom> play what you want
[2:13:28] <DetroitSentai> the post ARR stuff is neat but is badly paced
[2:13:30] <$valriot> Noone can defeat Godbert
[2:13:31] <+thundiedramon> In general, play what you want in this game
[2:13:32] <Angry_Ev1L> How about Ifrit Levi Ramuh and other cool ARR shit? come on
[2:13:32] <LandOfTheWay> more like everyone else is begging for the buffs i give
[2:13:37] <+thundiedramon> every job is pretty good
[2:13:40] <kazedan> Every job is viable, nothing is bad enough to be excluded
[2:13:40] <zamzoph> @mothmandraws those pesky slave rebellions
[2:13:45] <xmetalicdemonx> @rekinom I didnt know that when I first started so it kinda freaked me out.
[2:13:45] <Angry_Ev1L> Also cabbage kick
[2:13:49] <kazedan> some jobs wont get into speedkills because they don't bring enough
[2:13:53] <kazedan> but nothing is actually bad
[2:13:54] <+bluedude152> Cant wait to learn how to floor tank
[2:13:55] <+smevvster> But HW blows ARR outta the water.
[2:14:00] <%spiritofmojave> Cabbage kick was great gotta say
[2:14:02] <Monkeyweed21> make sure to do HILDIBRAND
[2:14:09] <%MoraMiarty> man, can't seem to catch the stream of the start
[2:14:12] <%yeknomlive> hey chat what's the first job you started as vs what you play mainly now
[2:14:14] <%MoraMiarty> what have I missed
[2:14:14] <Derkinstacker> Hildibrand is the true story.
[2:14:26] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Gigi best boi
[2:14:27] <+smevvster> Do the DRK quest story, the plot there is great.
[2:14:27] <%spiritofmojave> Howdy
[2:14:27] <$valriot> Hildibrand is literally SFM Shitposting
[2:14:40] <+thundiedramon> Started as Summoner, now Black Mage and looking into Astro and Gunbreaker
[2:14:43] <haveswordmuststing> BIG STRONK AXE is the best class hands down
[2:14:46] <kazedan> Started on BRD in ARR, playing mainly melee's now
[2:14:46] <aeonicvector> biggest question,,, tripple triad... whats the local rules
[2:14:46] <%MoraMiarty> ew sastasha
[2:14:47] <%NWR_James> Pat's back, raffle!

[2:14:59] <xmetalicdemonx> Hey pat how long do those primal quests take? Because they are taking forever.
[2:15:00] <@mothmandraws> pat doesnt want to turn that camrea around
[2:15:02] <$rdark_ksu> @AngriestPat you ate KC bbq or not?
[2:15:05] <$Valdorick> Except BLM, because you can just look at the ground to see what they do Kappa
[2:15:05] <+mik255> Can we nuke sastasha already
[2:15:07] <+ravenrooke> @AngriestPat I think you may be about to show this but, As a tank, is holding L2 and using L1 the way you recommend selecting the enemy with the lowest aggro to top it off again?

[2:15:26] <BinaryShuffle> Anyone know how large the FF14 install is now?
[2:15:26] <expressnode> My sleeping has been bad too. I didn't sleep until 8am today.

[2:15:40] <%snow_bush> Stop making me want to play this pat. I already have to paint a bunch of minis and Finish my Second Sekiro run
[2:15:46] <Angry_Ev1L> @AngriestPat when will you show COOL SHIT to bait people in? Like hype trailers or crazy fights with amazing music? instead of lame fucking dungeons
[2:15:46] <theobble> @LandOfTheWay that's me :)
[2:15:51] <+TheImmortal70> @angriestpat Have you seen the changes made to Dark Knight, and how do you feel about how it'll play in ShB?
[2:15:51] <meteor530> Everyone has their vice. Pats is Redbull
[2:15:52] <+midnightq2> how many people play as healer vs tank vs damage? is is easier for healers and tanks to get into groups?
[2:15:55] <%TheShal> Is he just standing around?
[2:15:55] <+thackattack00> @BinaryShuffle I think the base game is like 25 gigs
[2:15:55] <%MegboyManuel> okay question, can you show me your favourite class and outfit? Unless it's Dragoon
[2:15:56] <%TheShal> ....
[2:15:58] <+UndeadManatee> please show a cool primal to hype people
[2:16:01] <+mik255> youll get over it
[2:16:01] <%CaptainKarite> Mine is heal anxiety
[2:16:05] <%valkuma> tank anxiety? you just slap that boss
[2:16:07] <PontiusPyrite> the DPS are more afraid of you than you are of them
[2:16:07] <%TheSniperJoe> Tell that to the healer.
[2:16:10] <%yeknomlive> @vVAstrAVv yeah that sucks. they do have a tendency to fix classes each patch so hopefully that gets addressed
[2:16:12] <LandOfTheWay> @theobble congrats dude! still working on clearing o12s myself
[2:16:17] <%spiritofmojave> Heal anxiety is realer, but understandable
[2:16:18] <$valriot> Healer is the actual anxiety Role
[2:16:21] <yosukecchi> heal anxiety is the real tho
[2:16:22] <+cawi> Tank anxiety gets easier. Just tell people you are learning, and people generally understand.
[2:16:23] <%Venhammer> I love tanking
[2:16:23] <Nina96> @AngriestPat y is your character so huge?
[2:16:24] <BinaryShuffle> @thackattack00 TY
[2:16:25] <%MegboyManuel> I just wanna draw this FF14 boi apatGib
[2:16:25] <%DXLelouch24> How do you type with controller?
[2:16:26] <%snow_bush> @AngriestPat Do what I did as a healer in WoW. Hate everyone.
[2:16:27] <Analogflame> best way to get gil?
[2:16:27] <A_Red_Robot> @AngriestPat Thoughts on the 5.0 Dark Knight changes?
[2:16:28] <%ArcanumMBD> Watch a guide before every dungeon, then still be anxious. Thats what i do
[2:16:30] <Basch71> you basically stop giving a fuck what people think as an idea, its still just a class like any other
[2:16:30] <%yeknomlive> tankxiety = lack of confidence. you're gonna have to learn somehow though. it's kinda like fight games and playing online
[2:16:31] <%thefishofwar> thefishofwar subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months! Hey Pat, picked up 14 a month ago and now I've got two jobs at 60 and I'm just starting Stormblood! Thanks for the new addiction Mr. Ginger Funnyman :D
[2:16:33] <%EvilSoully> I've been playing for 3 years and I've been too scared to tank this entire time
[2:16:34] <2DSuperiority> I would just say if you're new just go with a DPS
[2:16:34] <%drabberfaun535> Why is there a picture of yoshi p in the corner?
[2:16:36] <%OdysseyKnight> Marauder/Warrior or Dark Knight as a first tank
[2:16:40] <+Bad1uck> Tanking anxiety? Just learn to loathe your party members
[2:16:42] <KatabolicRage> man don't watch guides for non savage content, your just ruining y our first time in shit
[2:16:43] <%Reizie_Etherealm> I have tank PTSD from fucking up this one time in an alliance raid and I caused my entire alliance to wipe, I quit being a tank after that
[2:16:43] <Bamcrash> I'm getting tanxiety right now leveling dark knight
[2:16:44] <$valriot> GREED ALL
[2:16:44] <@mothmandraws> im still not sure on etiquette
[2:16:44] <theobble> @LandOfTheWay don't give up, man. it'll become automatic at one point and everything will click all at once.
[2:16:45] <+Zepshire> I have tank anxiety but no heal anxiety
[2:16:48] <+thundiedramon> @DXLelouch24 If you have controller, odds are you have a keyboard on the side
[2:16:50] <Thepothero> Yeah don’t worry is what I’d say too
[2:16:50] <$valriot> FUCK EVERYONE ELSE
[2:16:54] <%spiritofmojave> Don't feel bad, people can replay shit

[2:17:06] <expressnode> The Need for Greed
[2:17:10] <Xelhesia> i started tanking recently and i too get really anxious but i've got nothing but support so far :)
[2:17:12] <+mik255> who wants shit from sastasha anyway?
[2:17:13] <@JustinianKnight> In an actual party with people you know you should usually ask first tho
[2:17:13] <+thundiedramon> I pass on most gear unless I need seals or glamor
[2:17:14] <%spiritofmojave> passing is too nice a gesture
[2:17:16] <+Silentman0> @drabberfaun535 nobody needs to see the in-game chat
[2:17:17] <+Deosier> I was too kind at first. now that i'm back I'm super need and greeding
[2:17:20] <%spiritofmojave> GREED ALL
[2:17:21] <xmetalicdemonx> I usually wait like 10 secounds and turn around and start jumping to see if everyone is ready between each fight.
[2:17:23] <+kyuubisonic> @angriestpat any tips for a SCH who hasnt played in two years and didnt backup their hotbars. I fucked up in a story dungeon and my anxiety has peaked. also can i see your sch hotbar?
[2:17:27] <@mothmandraws> my pretty butterfly sits on my shoulder

[2:17:50] <TheNamelessGun> First time through a dungeon I always pass on loot, cause I'm not a horrible person.
[2:17:50] <$valriot> OH BOY
[2:17:51] <+jsb011> its the whole cotanking thing that gives me anxiety
[2:17:54] <%frsttcs> free heavensward not compatible with the steam version

[2:18:48] <theobble> the ozma mount is dope
[2:19:04] <%Lapinelis> Explain the injokes of the game. Lalas - Evil potatoes, Dragoons - cleaning floors, Roe's - endangered species.
[2:19:04] <+Riseskimo> @AngriestPat When tanking, is there a way to track Enmity? I don't want to use the Enmity attacks all the time just to be sure
[2:19:09] <haveswordmuststing> @xmetalicdemonx it does not, 20 bucks more for complete edition should have everything after it launches
[2:19:12] <%SilverSFS> SilverSFS subscribed at Tier 1. 
[2:19:22] <@mothmandraws> explain adjusting as white mage
[2:19:28] <+midnightq2> how many people play as healer vs tank vs damage? is is easier for healers and tanks to get into groups?
[2:19:29] <+Silentman0> @AngriestPat please oh god please tell me that you don't have eos on sic, please
[2:19:32] <xmetalicdemonx> @haveswordmuststing thanks
[2:19:34] <DetroitSentai> Encounter table
[2:19:46] <%joylent_blue> more people DANCE FOR US apatGib
[2:19:48] <+thundiedramon> It's easier for dps to get into groups on party finder, but queue wise, tanks and healers have it easier
[2:19:48] <%QuadraticGravity> BIG CHAT
[2:19:49] <ColRedyx> @midnightq2 Much easier for tanks and healers.
[2:19:49] <smward87> Pat, healing? what madness is this
[2:19:50] <katocrimson> lol
[2:19:51] <Angry_Ev1L> @midnightmile yeah in general it's easier for healers and tanks to get into parties

[2:20:04] <haveswordmuststing> @xmetalicdemonx be sure to read the fine print before buying it to make sure it ACTUALLY comes with everything

[2:20:27] <%Rlexp> apatBig apatHoldon
[2:20:27] <%spiritofmojave> apatHoldon apatGib
[2:20:27] <Angry_Ev1L> Bullshit have your pet on SIC always be the real scrub Kappa
[2:20:28] <+Silentman0> @KatabolicRage it's fine for ifrit and titan but NEVER do that with the fairies
[2:20:36] <%joylent_blue> so guys, code vein is pretty cool
[2:20:47] <$Valdorick> YoshiP's vengeance comes for you, Pat!
[2:20:49] <ColRedyx> There are TWO places that aggro is displayed: the party list shows your aggro on your CURRENT TARGET ONLY in relation to everyone else under the job icons. The ENEMY LIST displays your aggro on every enemy as a colored symbol. Red = you have aggro, green = less than 50% aggro.
[2:20:50] <Angry_Ev1L> yeah sic on fairies is a big no no tho. might as well play white mage
[2:20:51] <%monstergills> apatBig apatHoldon apatDab
[2:20:58] <%spiritofmojave> oh man pets can fuck off into the next dimension next patch, thank god
[2:21:02] <@JustinianKnight> yep
[2:21:03] <vVAstrAVv> being a sic smn is fine but no no for sic fairies
[2:21:05] <%TheSniperJoe> ...wait can't you?
[2:21:06] <%PunishedRaccoon> @AngriestPat do you think i will be fine to wait for sb so i can play as GNB thru stormblood
[2:21:08] <smward87> I see that Yoshi-P hiding in the corner. you can't fool me Pat
[2:21:08] <+grenberr1> @AngriestPat i'd love to start playing this game, but my pc explodes anytime i look at this game, do you think its worth getting into the game on ps4? or should i wait to upgrade my pc and play it then?
[2:21:18] <%a_lucky_soul> How do you remember what Seal combination does what when using ninja?
[2:21:20] <AngryPhant0m> @AngriestPat Hey I just finished the first part of the MSQ and there are now A TON of dungeon/raid quests in Mor Dhona is it nessasary to complete them all or should i just continue the MSQ
[2:21:21] <%Lapinelis> Trying out controler, how do you adjust window size live again?
[2:21:23] <Rentixx> Oh hey, the new FF14 update is out?
[2:21:24] <%SirKamBam> lol Yoshi P
[2:21:24] <%gunplagoat> @AngriestPat Any chance your gonna check out classic wow when that launches since you like mmos >
[2:21:25] <ColRedyx> I did not know about the enemy list aggro display when I started.
[2:21:26] <theobble> light party
[2:21:28] <+Rabbitmage> What is a reason to play FF14 over WoW?
[2:21:28] <%yeknomlive> pat's been pretty on point so far
[2:21:31] <+Rose_Silver> @grenberr1 it's pretty good on the ps4
[2:21:33] <@mothmandraws> expert pat
[2:21:35] <%Reizie_Etherealm> LUL
[2:21:36] <+thundiedramon> @a_lucky_soul personally I remember them as 123 for mudras
[2:21:37] <ColRedyx> @Rentixx Not yet, teaching noobs in preparation.
[2:21:37] <@JustinianKnight> Muscle Memory
[2:21:38] <$rdark_ksu> salsa or horshradish?
[2:21:38] <+TheDestinyPotato> You remember by remembering it
[2:21:39] <%Arnschen> You get used to it
[2:21:40] <+Silentman0> @Rabbitmage it's much better made
[2:21:43] <$valriot> @punishedraccoon Gunbreaker starts at 60, so i dont see why not
[2:21:44] <%Halowood> It's whatever the last seal is
[2:21:44] <+Zepshire> practice the mudra combos
[2:21:44] <Angry_Ev1L> @Rabbitmage Cute cat girls
[2:21:45] <%CaptainKarite> I got mine to 47, honestly, you just memorize it
[2:21:46] <+thundiedramon> So Suiton is 123, Huton is 321
[2:21:46] <@JustinianKnight> you just memorize
[2:21:47] <LandOfTheWay> @Rabbitmage an actual story that's legit good
[2:21:50] <$valriot> PALADIN
[2:21:50] <PontiusPyrite> BLU
[2:21:52] <@SpaceCaptainCrone> If you think about it, you mess it up, those are the rules.
[2:21:54] <%cvp5127> booo
[2:21:54] <%Arnschen> If you keep the mudras in the same place, it comes naturally after a while
[2:21:54] <Covil91> The only seal that matters for ninjutsus are the last one.
[2:21:54] <thetyrantcbass> The PS4 version is fine, better on a pro obv
[2:21:56] <KruelDestiny> You'll remember the more you use them
[2:21:57] <IFlaske> WRONG! Gatherers are excellent for solo
[2:21:59] <+TheSaintJohn> Trust System coming tho
[2:22:00] <%AquilaHarukaze> You remember NIN mudras by coming up with dumb analogies in your head.
[2:22:00] <+thundiedramon> it comes naturally after a while
[2:22:00] <ColRedyx> For Ninja, you remember the shapes you make to get skills rather than the exact orders.
[2:22:02] <%TheSniperJoe> Literally all of them can solo.
[2:22:03] <indig0bird> The combination doesn't matter, just the end mudra
[2:22:03] <%joylent_blue> @Rabbitmage FF14 isn't butt ugly
[2:22:03] <%Jaxnos> you can't make me have friends limesD
[2:22:06] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Paladin ignoring mechanics with hallowed ground LUL
[2:22:06] <%snow_bush> Why are your initials the same as mine? They mess with me!
[2:22:09] <KatabolicRage> Paladin is also up there cos they have a heal
[2:22:09] <$valriot> LMAO NO
[2:22:10] <%spiritofmojave> Trust system might build that up
[2:22:11] <Bamcrash> For ninja, only the number and FINAL mudra matter
[2:22:11] <%PunishedRaccoon> @valriot thank you :)
[2:22:13] <%yeknomlive> redmage top tier in eureka and potd
[2:22:14] <Xelhesia> Samurai after that
[2:22:14] <metrying> whats a good hub for new players to get some friends? all my buddies play br's rn :(
[2:22:16] <Tucker0603> Paladin
[2:22:16] <+cawi> For NIN combinations I just remember what the last mudra is to determine what ability I want.
[2:22:16] <%TombstoneTTromboners> warrior
[2:22:17] <@CreepyPorpoise> Blue mage is the true solo class
[2:22:19] <%Jamejarrs> Barring dungeons, Scholar is pretty good cuz you never die haha
[2:22:20] <ColRedyx> And yeah, the combos for Ninja don't matter, only how many mudras and which was last.
[2:22:22] <IFlaske> Become miner and get black lung it's sick
[2:22:23] <blond_e> Is Paladin worth leveling for Shadowbringers?
[2:22:23] <$valriot> Cuck DPS
[2:22:23] <Angry_Ev1L> Here's the tip for you boys - FUCK RED MAGE. If you want to be cool play some real jobs Kappa
[2:22:30] <%PanicSwytch> @angriestpat Do you recommend if i create a character now or wait for update?
[2:22:30] <ColRedyx> The most important are just 123 and 321 anyway.
[2:22:31] <meteor530> So wait...if I want to play a different class I don't need a separate character?
[2:22:31] <Daniel_Is_I> Do people not know what the second M in MMO stands for? lol
[2:22:33] <Bamcrash> So a>b>c is the same as b>a>c
[2:22:35] <%templar010> OH GOD, BLUE is nonexistent
[2:22:36] <+Silentman0> best solo job: blue mage
[2:22:38] <%templar010> BLU*
[2:22:39] <+TheImmortal70> DRG
[2:22:43] <$valriot> Red Mage is for babies, its garbage
[2:22:47] <%TheSniperJoe> Dragoon gets A LOT of buttons.
[2:22:49] <vVAstrAVv> bard!
[2:22:50] <%killfrost11> bard
[2:22:53] <@mothmandraws> fun and have some self sustain heals
[2:22:55] <%templar010> BRD is good
[2:22:56] <Derkinstacker> And you'll be expected to die, so no pressure.
[2:22:56] <%TheSniperJoe> I would go with a Warrior or a Black Mage.
[2:23:01] <$valriot> LUL
[2:23:01] <moogleboy1984> my husband solo'd Mist Dragon on PLD lol
[2:23:05] <Finaldragoon> level Arcanist because when you unlock Summoner and Scholar you level both at the same time
[2:23:05] <+reddpop_> I started recently and went lnc>drg>rdm and im having a great time
[2:23:05] <ColRedyx> Not Arcanist > SMN? The pet will take care of a good portion of your DPS for you.
[2:23:07] <+bluedude152> play blu
[2:23:09] <Angry_Ev1L> For dragoon hype watch HW trailer
[2:23:11] <meteor530> I'm looking to play Pugilist. Never played FF14 before. Is this a mistake????
[2:23:14] <ColRedyx> And they can summon a tank pet to distract enemies.
[2:23:14] <xmetalicdemonx> I've had a good time playing with randoms they have always done their job.
[2:23:15] <+Zepshire> arcanist to dual level a dps and healer
[2:23:17] <+Bad1uck> RDM shines as a res bot
[2:23:19] <+Silentman0> @ColRedyx plus you get to level up 2 jobs at the same time
[2:23:20] <+Angrec> yeah at 70 drg is super busy with mirage dive
[2:23:25] <%Arnschen> Yeah, Arcanist is another good one to start with
[2:23:28] <+Huderga> @meteor530 no
[2:23:28] <@mothmandraws> If I can do it so can you
[2:23:34] <%a_lucky_soul> ok thanks
[2:23:39] <%Reizie_Etherealm> I will fight everyone who class shame RDM
[2:23:40] <Xelhesia> lancer archer marauder conjurer are best beginning classes
[2:23:40] <+UndeadManatee> only mch is a mistake
[2:23:41] <ColRedyx> Yeah I would say start as Arcanist because the pet will ensure you do at least some decent DPS
[2:23:44] <%spiritofmojave> @meteor530 it'll be up to spec by next expansion soon, you should be good
[2:23:50] <supuhmagikarp> "Beginers should play lancers" lies your just trying to create more floor tanks. for too long the floor has been left unchecked.
[2:23:51] <thetyrantcbass> Start as arcanist or marauder so Limsa is your hometown, then switch to rogue at lv10
[2:23:54] <haveswordmuststing> @meteor530 just remember many of you moves have extra effects at certain positions
[2:23:54] <$valriot> Red Mage is literally inferior to both other Casters cos they put obsurd weight onto its rez ability, plus its rotation is broken
[2:24:02] <%yeknomlive> rezmage
[2:24:04] <%LegendCobra> are you going to upload it?
[2:24:13] <+Silentman0> i personally just think red mage is fun to play, even if it's not particularly strong
[2:24:16] <Dastardry> No job in this mmo is so complicated you can't pick it. This isn't DMC

[2:29:42] <+ecolli37108> so you can sink a lot into it for free
[2:29:44] <%Kenori> its not free on PS4

[2:33:23] <Xelhesia> lol
[2:33:23] <ColRedyx> Woo! Most boring boss in the entire game!
[2:33:23] <%MegboyManuel> Copperbell is FINE
[2:33:25] <r_Foeburden87> MMAID Archer
[2:33:27] <+The_UnfathoMarble> Taco Bell?
[2:33:28] <%snow_bush> Now to shit the bed live on stream
[2:33:29] <+TheImmortal70> Fuck Copperbell
[2:33:29] <theobble> Snowcloak is the worst in the game
[2:33:30] <%yeknomlive> copperbell has one of the best unique bosses
[2:33:31] <%LegendCobra> secretly all the low level dungeons are shit
[2:33:31] <$valriot> Copperbell is actually a good one for teaching
[2:33:31] <+TheImmortal70> It's BORING
[2:33:32] <+DrunkenDice> can't tell if this is sarcasm
[2:33:33] <+Silentman0> the slime boss is boring but otherwise good dungeon
[2:33:33] <$SleepyMaribo> @AngriestPat do Susano'o!!!
[2:33:33] <Covil91> Worst bosses in the game
[2:33:34] <ItIsSky> everything is gonna be destroyed
[2:33:35] <AdmiralButtloaf> lol all the bosses have gimmick mechanics
[2:33:37] <+ecolli37108> copperbell is a weird starter dungeon. mechanics that never get used again. lol
[2:33:38] <%radda343> yeyeyeye I love those little dust balls
[2:33:41] <+TheImmortal70> Snowcloak is WONDERFUL compared to copperbell
[2:33:41] <+Answer_Moose> Tanking low level is the worst
[2:33:46] <haveswordmuststing> Astra-low-gion Kappa
[2:33:47] <ColRedyx> Yeah otherwise good dungeon but the slime is the worst boss in the whole game.
[2:33:48] <+mrkevinorex> Wha saaaaaaaaaaaa
[2:33:53] <+ch0ob> Copperbell was fine until you start getting it 90% of the leveling roulette while progressing SwiftRage
[2:33:56] <+TheImmortal70> The worst is aurum vale, followed by totorak
[2:33:56] <%snow_bush> Is that a maid?
[2:34:01] <IntrepidEye> we doing XIV tutorial for babbys?
[2:34:02] <+thundiedramon> Yes
[2:34:04] <thetyrantcbass> Big pulls!
[2:34:04] <ShutUpAceyP> battlemaid!
[2:34:05] <pepsi591ml> zoning in to a low level roulette is like logging in to World of Warcaft at the beginning of an expansion!
[2:34:12] <%snow_bush> Go Go Meido!
[2:34:12] <Animal_Farm4> It's on the left by default pat
[2:34:17] <%yeknomlive> first room of aurum vale is so fucked
[2:34:19] <HeadsHeldHigh> TP can't go away soon enough
[2:34:19] <@lewdskeletor13> “Just hit ‘em” expert gameplay advice
[2:34:23] <theobble> blue?
[2:34:27] <ColRedyx> He meant green
[2:34:33] <Helghast102> as a DPS you want to see blinking orange
[2:34:34] <Dastardry> Could you lower the sound effects a bit? They're overpowering you talking.
[2:34:35] <ColRedyx> Tanking is going to become even easier in Shadowbringers
[2:34:38] <%PabuPanda> Yo, someone tell me again how Pat's got those other buttons on the side of the crossbar?
[2:34:41] <$Valdorick> If you're a BLM, always stay at orange Kappa
[2:34:42] <%LegendCobra> how do you not steal aggro from tank as dps?
[2:34:45] <Angry_Ev1L> I'll steal all the agro and I don't give a fuck
[2:34:46] <%LegendCobra> do less shit?
[2:34:51] <%a_lucky_soul> does that mean bad tank or?
[2:34:52] <rekinom> Battle maid PogChamp
[2:34:52] <+cawi> you can also see the threat order by the health bars.
[2:34:53] <MoonObscure> RIP
[2:34:53] <Angry_Ev1L> rip mothman
[2:34:54] <+thundiedramon> @PabuPanda they're pc hotbars set to the side to see them as cooldowns
[2:34:56] <%valkuma> WAIFU
[2:35:00] <+miguelrod777> F
[2:35:02] <%yeknomlive> you have to let the dps die when they pull
[2:35:02] <%korth367> u lived a good life mothman
[2:35:06] <%shawntk_> pat not even putting on stance
[2:35:08] <%PabuPanda> Oh, only PC? Not for PS4?
[2:35:13] <ColRedyx> @AngriestPat In Shadowbringers tanking will just be turning on tank stance and doing whatever the hell you want because everything will generate enmity. Tanking will be even easier than now.
[2:35:14] <$valriot> Also the small bars under your Job icon shows aggro meter
[2:35:15] <@lewdskeletor13> Grand Moff Man
[2:35:18] <MoonObscure> or let them die so they learn the lesson.
[2:35:19] <+thefakeh> just let them dier
[2:35:24] <+BioHunter> its for ps4 too
[2:35:25] <Kghaleon> Good job Mothman
[2:35:26] <Xelhesia> gj mothman
[2:35:26] <yosukecchi> mothman's character is super cute
[2:35:29] <Nina96> how tanky are takes in this game?
[2:35:29] <@SpaceCaptainCrone> Kinda hard to tell in Copperbell since enemies don't do a lot of damage yet
[2:35:29] <Daniel_Is_I> Or just let them die because don't fucking pull ahead of the tank.
[2:35:29] <@SSaryn> Mothman is so strong than he can tank everything.
[2:35:31] <+thundiedramon> @PabuPanda You can set up pc bars on PS4 too, it's just if you have controller that it's useful for
[2:35:32] <AdmiralButtloaf> happy gay pride moth
[2:35:37] <%Nobrev> @PabuPanda you can set them upon ps4 too
[2:35:40] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Alternatively, there's an aggro BAR underneath the class icons at the top left of the screen
[2:35:42] <Lotharman> Except for those crocodiles!
[2:35:49] <+thundiedramon> you can't see everything so it helps for seeing when things on another hotbar are up
[2:35:51] <@lewdskeletor13> @admiralbuttloaf You too! KappaPride
[2:35:53] <HibikiYamada> @LegendCobra there are one or two abilities that let you manage your own aggro, but it usually isn't a problem. Problems pop up when there's an undergeared tank or the tank is just bad.
[2:35:53] <xmetalicdemonx> Alright I feel good playing as a tank. I try to do the same thing.
[2:36:02] <%Typhaeon> Where somebody = Pat
[2:36:03] <RadShiro> Assume ALL DPS are too stupid to function unless they prove otherwise

[2:36:06] <Clyderso> Leashed PogChamp
[2:36:07] <%LegendCobra> thank you
[2:36:08] <%Shady_Squid> Any advice on how to switch targets using the controller? When I gave 14 a shot a while back I couldn't get into it because I felt like the targeting system was fighting me.
[2:36:09] <ColRedyx> Yup, there are aggro bars on the party list as well but they only apply to the current target.
[2:36:09] <+hazzy_o7> Don't let them die. That's really annoying and waste time for the other 2.
[2:36:13] <%rumtumtugnutz> womp womp
[2:36:14] <Angry_Ev1L> it was green
[2:36:15] <Monkeyweed21> it's green pat
[2:36:16] <ColRedyx> What you actually want to look at is the enemy list.
[2:36:16] <+hazzy_o7> I hate that mentality
[2:36:17] <$shadow1man9> Yeah the mobs in this dungeon have weird tether points
[2:36:21] <Covil91> That is like the only mob pack in the game that leashes
[2:36:29] <+Silentman0> pat is apparently japanese because he doesn't know the difference between blue and green
[2:36:34] <%frsttcs> It's definitely green

[2:36:58] <Monkeyweed21> Pat is colorblind remember
[2:37:05] <Angry_Ev1L> smug idiot tanks that let people die deserve to be kicked. Only let dps die if they're ANNOYING and pulled several times for no good reason
[2:37:08] <$valriot> DPS need to know to ACTUALLY attack the SAME target as the tank and or other DPS @angriestpat
[2:37:12] <%ThatGuyfromMars> POTION SELLER
[2:37:12] <Clyderso> cant wait for braindead aggro management in ShB PogChamp
[2:37:13] <helpmeimafruit> You can't handle my potions
[2:37:18] <%TheSniperJoe> apatHoldon apatWrong apatCrazyhand apatCrazyhead
[2:37:19] <ColRedyx> @Shady_Squid If you need to retarget quickly, press B/Circle to cancel your target and then A/X to retarget whatever your character is pointing at. Otherwise left/right on the dpad with neither trigger held will cycle enemies based on their position on your screen. L1+up or down will select targets based on their order in the party list.
[2:37:21] <@lewdskeletor13> ONLY THE FINEST POTIONS
[2:37:21] <%Kenori> Maybe you just need Stronger Potions potion seller
[2:37:22] <theobble> Is he colorblind? I suddenly feel like a dick.
[2:37:24] <DetroitSentai> for your current target on the party list
[2:37:27] <+hazzy_o7> @Angry_Ev1L Agreed. there's more than 2 ppl in a instance.
[2:37:31] <@JustinianKnight> YOU CAN'T HANDLE THEM
[2:37:33] <%TheSniperJoe> You will use things like Potions on high end stuff and raiding, Pat's super wrong about that.
[2:37:36] <$Valdorick> If you're with a BLM, just expect that fucker to unload with FireII all the time.
[2:37:41] <Derkinstacker> Less than a month now.

[2:37:50] <KruelDestiny> do combo
[2:37:52] <HeadsHeldHigh> Oh shit they're getting rid of em?
[2:37:54] <DetroitSentai> That blm is just being optimal
[2:37:56] <+thundiedramon> Yeah
[2:37:57] <%ThatGuyfromMars> I CAN'T WlN THE BATTLE WITHOUT YOUR STRONGEST POTlONS POTION SELLER
[2:37:57] <Clyderso> yep BibleThump
[2:37:58] <@SpaceCaptainCrone> Unless you're a warrior, then they do the MOST damage for some reason
[2:37:58] <ColRedyx> @Shady_Squid If you don't press A/X after picking a new target, then only your NEXT ability will hit that enemy and then your target will return. To hard lock, just press A/X after selecting a new target before using abilities again.
[2:37:58] <Monkeyweed21> don't forget to shirk the dps who forget their place
[2:37:59] <SailingSaturn> Ice 2 is worthless cirBlech
[2:38:01] <DetroitSentai> they should divery tho
[2:38:03] <thetyrantcbass> Potions are for people who don’t have Vercure [tipping feather hat]

[2:38:09] <%TheSniperJoe> You're useless in savage.
[2:38:11] <+NeonLight> Tanks now just have their aggro stance
[2:38:11] <+thundiedramon> everyone is gonna have tank stance as mandatory, so no need for aggro combos
[2:38:11] <Daniel_Is_I> CHAIN PULL
[2:38:14] <Xelhesia> big pulls XD
[2:38:15] <%MegboyManuel> Yeeeee Wall to Wall

[2:38:26] <%yeknomlive> over pull and sprint away/los from the healer is a tanking classic
[2:38:26] <%MegboyManuel> pop cooldowns
[2:38:28] <$valriot> No, thats what good players do
[2:38:32] <ColRedyx> Why wouldn't a new player do this? Best way to train :D Just remember to pop your cooldowns!
[2:38:33] <DetroitSentai> Big pulls arent hard to heal
[2:38:33] <@lewdskeletor13> I see that shit
[2:38:40] <@JustinianKnight> THIS IS BAD THO
[2:38:40] <%MegboyManuel> Wall to fucking wall
[2:38:40] <%PabuPanda> Okay. I finally figured out those hotbars. Thanks, people.
[2:38:41] <Daniel_Is_I> If you have a new healer, ONE PACK AT A TIME
[2:38:42] <+thundiedramon> Basically mass pulls are not a good idea if you don't know what you're doing

[2:39:03] <%CaptainKarite> it's level 20, what aoes? LUL
[2:39:04] <%Unlimited_> never again
[2:39:06] <ColRedyx> Basically, figure out what you're doing so you can do mass pulls.
[2:39:06] <%LegendCobra> low level dps doesnt have aoe
[2:39:07] <cylish> They dont have any aoe right now
[2:39:08] <%MegboyManuel> THey dont have AOES dude
[2:39:10] <RollCritFail> My favorite aggro combo is kicking them in the shins then insulting their mother Kappa
[2:39:10] <DetroitSentai> General rule is 3 or 4 groups, AOE
[2:39:11] <DaydreamDisaster> low level dont have many aoe opetions :o
[2:39:12] <SailingSaturn> what not to do as a newbie who doesn't know what they are doing
[2:39:16] <Smileyhat> @AngriestPat At this level most jobs don't have their AOEs

[2:39:41] <+trainflip> DRG gets those pretty late
[2:39:42] <%Reizie_Etherealm> 3* more than 3 is the calculated DPS increase threshold
[2:39:44] <%QuadraticGravity> Pat you asshole DRG gets doom spike at 40
[2:39:45] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> pat is a dummy
[2:39:45] <@lewdskeletor13> It’s not Moff Mans fault!
[2:39:46] <%MegboyManuel> but wall to wall anyway
[2:39:46] <+ThatHomestar> bard/archer absolutely has an AoE at that level

[2:40:06] <Smileyhat> @SailingSaturn I think black mage would be the only other one.
[2:40:07] <DetroitSentai> blm has fire ii at 18
[2:40:10] <$Valdorick> PROOF that Black Mage is the best - they have Fire 2 at level 18, Kappa
[2:40:14] <@lewdskeletor13> @desudesudokidoki Whoa those are fighting words
[2:40:17] <AdmiralButtloaf> RDM, BLM, ARC, MCH have aoe at low lvls
[2:40:17] <Xelhesia> samurai aoes and bard aoes are the best
[2:40:18] <Clyderso> rip Scholar AoE BibleThump
[2:40:19] <$valriot> SHAME CHECK
[2:40:26] <+Kaask> that's not inherently true. monks arm of the destroyer is only better than bootshine at 5 enemies. in shadowbringers, itll be 4 enemies. you have to calculate potency per skill, but usually 3 or 4 is safe.
[2:40:34] <+mik255> take your time
[2:40:35] <+thundiedramon> Casual reminder that gear does not equal skill as well
[2:40:36] <SailingSaturn> @valriot thank goodness cirCola
[2:40:45] <Rhinoprotoss> Please explain upgrading gear and stuff
[2:40:46] <+Answer_Moose> Or don't do big pulls if your healer is a scholar
[2:40:50] <Lotharman> Level might be minimum required too
[2:40:55] <@lewdskeletor13> What is a pull?
[2:40:57] <+thundiedramon> but checking to see if your healer has the gear to be able to do the pull is always good
[2:41:01] <DetroitSentai> Usually ask if the healer would be comfortable going big imo
[2:41:03] <Daniel_Is_I> Worst way to waste time is trying to save time.
[2:41:03] <DonovynN> scholars can handle big pulls just fine tho?
[2:41:04] <+Deosier> yup then I get flack for not healing
[2:41:04] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> wats a pull
[2:41:06] <%valkuma> Astrologian healers are best healers Pog
[2:41:07] <ColRedyx> @lewdskeletor13 Engaging an enemy.
[2:41:07] <+cawi> I ask my group if they want big pulls or not.
[2:41:07] <SailingSaturn> I remember spamming my cone aoe as a WAR and wasting TP LUL
[2:41:08] <+thundiedramon> Asking the healer is also good
[2:41:11] <+mik255> "boss"
[2:41:17] <ColRedyx> A pull is when you engage enemies, because you "pull" them toward you.
[2:41:17] <+Silentman0> @DesuDesuDokiDoki attack a group of enemies to start an encounter
[2:41:18] <$shadow1man9> This boss is just trash
[2:41:18] <+thundiedramon> """"boss""""""
[2:41:19] <Angry_Ev1L> never ask healer anything. If they fuck up silently judge them Kappa
[2:41:26] <$valriot> "Stats" is half true, its also general compitance and skill needed to know how to play

[2:42:22] <+NeonLight> oh god theyre gonna have to explains the slime boss
[2:42:22] <thetyrantcbass> (I seem to have misplaced my keyboard.)
[2:42:27] <%DXLelouch24> Theres a jump button now?
[2:42:30] <+thundiedramon> Yes
[2:42:33] <+ClaireBearz> yet even max lvl players still fuck up the next boss all the time
[2:42:36] <+sanoblaze> There’s also a cheer emote you can buy which basically doubles as those airplane coordinator things
[2:42:42] <@JustinianKnight> Not in this fight
[2:42:44] <%AquilaHarukaze> This room is mostly kind of a freeforall for the dps
[2:42:45] <+TheImmortal70> Except not really because these things are PUSHOVERS
[2:42:50] <Kghaleon> I have no idea where to plug a keyboard into my PS4, all the ports are used <_<
[2:42:52] <+TheImmortal70> You breathe on them and they die
[2:42:56] <+Answer_Moose> It must be nice to have a damaging AoE pre-46
[2:42:57] <Daniel_Is_I> And if your tank can't cut it, DPS gotta protect the healers
[2:43:01] <+mik255> heres the "boss"
[2:43:04] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> lewd
[2:43:11] <@lewdskeletor13> Big boys making big noise
[2:43:11] <+Qsmash_> So, are DRKs supposed to use Grit ever?
[2:43:19] <+hazzy_o7> No
[2:43:20] <+thundiedramon> Yes
[2:43:20] <%TheShal> Explain the target circle next!!!
[2:43:22] <thetyrantcbass> You can totally use a usb hub on a ps4
[2:43:23] <professorarcana> @Answer_Moose I hate how long it takes SMN to get decent AOE
[2:43:23] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Enemies in dungeons are bundled together into groups and pulling one will aggro all the enemies in that group
[2:43:24] <KruelDestiny> do combo
[2:43:25] <ricotez> yes
[2:43:27] <+TheImmortal70> Grit is required
[2:43:27] <+Rabbitmage> This game looks really easy.
[2:43:29] <+thundiedramon> You're supposed to be in Grit to pull enemies
[2:43:30] <ZaDoorman> this is why my rule of thumb with dungeons is Tip Your Tank when you give a commendation.
[2:43:31] <+cawi> Did you explain positionals? @AngriestPat

[2:43:42] <Monkeyweed21> USE TANK STANCE
[2:43:42] <%AquilaHarukaze> He did
[2:43:43] <ColRedyx> Dark Knights don't have Grit until level 30, and this is a level 20 dungeon.
[2:43:44] <KlorikonWilds> Wait, so is the whole agro mechanic just being dropped?
[2:43:44] <theobble> @cawi he did
[2:43:44] <+thundiedramon> Yes they did @cawi
[2:43:48] <@lewdskeletor13> @rabbitmage I thinks this is like an early dungeon
[2:43:49] <+cawi> oh ok thanks
[2:43:53] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Show them orbonne
[2:43:53] <DetroitSentai> 3rd dungeon in the game
[2:43:55] <@JustinianKnight> its not being dropped
[2:43:56] <%shawntk_> he can't use grit in this dungeon, it's a level 30 skill
[2:43:56] <+NeonLight> I love that stance dancing is toned way the hell down
[2:43:58] <+thundiedramon> Aggro is still here, but they made is MUCH easier to keep
[2:43:59] <ColRedyx> @Rabbitmage Because this is the easiest type of group content in the game pretty much.
[2:44:00] <$valriot> All dungeons are easy to be honest
[2:44:02] <transporterthesequel> Pat show them SUSANOO
[2:44:03] <Covil91> Next do The Vault with a new healer. LUL

[2:44:18] <ColRedyx> @Rabbitmage Go to Youtube and search for "UCoB" to see the game at its hardest.

[2:45:01] <professorarcana> @Answer_Moose Such sad :( This game feels like it has a big lack of AOE early game
[2:45:02] <@lewdskeletor13> apatGib apatGib apatGib
[2:45:02] <Angry_Ev1L> Show suzaku
[2:45:03] <CybertronPrime> Wild and pure and FOREVER FREE
[2:45:05] <%MyDarkStorm> @AngriestPat With chat?
[2:45:05] <keiji_maede> Are you a man or a boi?
[2:45:05] <BanSenpai> What server, I can probably help
[2:45:06] <%Zamorouskiwhich> Id heal for Susano, but I'm stuck at work BibleThump
[2:45:18] <Derkinstacker> Very few bosses need Tank LBs
[2:45:23] <%shawntk_> when should tanks ever be the ones to use LBs
[2:45:23] <+mik255> mothman is ranged
[2:45:26] <%LegendCobra> i always take that LB
[2:45:27] <Covil91> In 4 mans the best LB is an AoE one.
[2:45:29] <%Lapinelis> It depends if you have big pulls magic LB is great
[2:45:32] <ColRedyx> Mothman is the DRG
[2:45:33] <DetroitSentai> Sometimes a caster DPS for big pull strats
[2:45:34] <CybertronPrime> What Data Center are you on Pat?
[2:45:35] <+Silentman0> i can heal susanoo but he's probably going to have a full party already on account of his guild
[2:45:35] <+Kaask> its rangeds job to limit large groups
[2:45:37] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Mothman is a LANCER, how is that ranged
[2:45:37] <@SpaceCaptainCrone> There are some fights where you BS mechanics by using tank limit breaks
[2:45:37] <+Answer_Moose> @professorarcana The next xpac though PLD is getting SO MANY AoE's
[2:45:41] <+thundiedramon> He's on Primal
[2:45:43] <AdmiralButtloaf> explain the roles of LBs
[2:45:43] <+Kaask> even in trash pulls, its just faster than using it on a boss
[2:45:46] <thetyrantcbass> The LB bar is for Alisaie.
[2:45:48] <$Valdorick> He can throw his spear Kappa
[2:45:48] <+NeonLight> aoe lb is great for big pulls
[2:46:04] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> lances are long so it is a ranged poke
[2:46:07] <Derkinstacker> It's gonna get edgier
[2:46:08] <ShichiNoBushi> Edgy
[2:46:08] <Xelhesia> i would bard or samurai for susano'o but im at work atm :(
[2:46:10] <$valriot> LB is for when the boss is at 1% @angriestpat Kappa Kappa
[2:46:11] <@lewdskeletor13> Elmo the people wanna see you
[2:46:15] <Derkinstacker> Edgy stands
[2:46:16] <%rumtumtugnutz> Still doesn't make lancer a range class
[2:46:18] <+mik255> show off the power of fell cleave!
[2:46:19] <+The_UnfathoMarble> It's a pretty design!
[2:46:27] <SailingSaturn> So many classes I want try in 5.0 cirPls
[2:46:27] <ColRedyx> @AdmiralButtloaf Tank LB = reduce damage, never use except for required mechanics. Healer LB = mass heal/res, use for near-wipes. Melee LB = single-target damage, use on bosses. Ranged/Caster LB = AOE, use on trash.
[2:46:28] <flubber3d> edge. edge.
[2:46:32] <+Riseskimo> @AngriestPat With Shadowbringers, will Tanks basically be DPS with tanking capabilities (if they wish to do so)?

[2:46:55] <%st4rrytea> abuse!!
[2:46:56] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@thetyrantcbass) (warning)
[2:46:57] <AdmiralButtloaf> @ColRedyx I know. explain for the people
[2:46:57] <Angry_Ev1L> @Riseskimo tanks are already DPSes with tanking capabilities
[2:46:57] <+Dogfootjoe> @AngriestPat Whats the skill difference between controller and Keyboard? sorry if you already talked about it
[2:46:58] <+Silentman0> @Shady_Squid black mage
[2:47:04] <%TheSniperJoe> Limit Breaks, are largely only for DPS to use at the end of a boss fight to deal a tremendous ammount of damage and finish it off. Healer LB's can resurrect a team when almost everyone is dead and put them at full, and TANK LB's are used in like...three encounters in the whole game so don't worry about it.
[2:47:04] <%frsttcs> Elmo the big mad
[2:47:05] <+thundiedramon> RDM has the most extra spells, BLM for the most explosion
[2:47:11] <+Answer_Moose> Also Sussano is a GREAT fight to show off for the stream. God that Active time event is GREAT
[2:47:17] <%Reizie_Etherealm> And here we have an example of how not to tank, going afk or making the party wait just cause you can set the pace
[2:47:20] <CybertronPrime> New Primal? Because the servers were rearranged a while back.
[2:47:23] <Derkinstacker> Always fighting for MT on susanoo
[2:47:24] <ZaDoorman> man, I hope Gunbreaker gets some sick looking weapons.
[2:47:26] <+mik255> comfort mostly
[2:47:27] <+Dogfootjoe> @AngriestPat kk ilkl wait for Vod
[2:47:29] <+Riseskimo> thank you for the answers
[2:47:31] <ColRedyx> @Dogfootjoe None, except maybe healer has a slightly harder time picking targets until you get good at it.
[2:47:31] <%Ninestempest> @AngriestPat you better put a vod up of this, I play this game a lot but i wanna hear you talk about it more
[2:47:32] <@lewdskeletor13> Remember when Pat knocked over Elmo with a couch arm chair? I remember
[2:47:34] <%Shady_Squid> @Silentman0 Sounds like what i'll be playing then
[2:47:36] <HeadsHeldHigh> Controller doesn't destroy my wrists
[2:47:37] <ZimmiZ> damn now I want to play ffxiv
[2:47:38] <+SDT_Mercury> @AngriestPat what serber are you on??
[2:47:40] <+thundiedramon> His server never moved from Primal
[2:47:41] <Animal_Farm4> Is there any good way to queue for extremes? I've been in queue for over 30 minutes for 5 different ones and none of them are even close to filling
[2:47:42] <meteor530> I find playing with a controller is tough
[2:47:47] <+Answer_Moose> @ZaDoorman They get gunblades man, how is that not sick.
[2:47:48] <+NeonLight> BEST BOSS
[2:47:51] <$SleepyMaribo> @AngriestPat that sword looks sick.. and now i gotta go get it...
[2:47:53] <+thundiedramon> Oh god, this boss
[2:47:53] <xmetalicdemonx> This one sucks.
[2:47:56] <ColRedyx> @Dogfootjoe There are controller players in all the world first groups, it's not a hindrance at all.
[2:47:59] <%Unlimited_> this boss sucks
[2:48:02] <@lewdskeletor13> FLUBBER?
[2:48:03] <+Dogfootjoe> @ColRedyx gotcha.
[2:48:03] <+Silentman0> @Shady_Squid it's a good job, just remember that avoiding mechanics is more important than "ideal damage"
[2:48:03] <TheNamelessGun> Controller is for couch potatoes. Key+Mouse is for Lalafell potatoes.
[2:48:06] <Angry_Ev1L> @Animal_Farm4 use party finder for extremes
[2:48:08] <Storm_Samurai> That explosion lacked umph
[2:48:08] <2DSuperiority> This requires Mechanical knowledge
[2:48:10] <$Valdorick> Spam Fire forever, got it.
[2:48:14] <@lewdskeletor13> THATS FUCKING FLUBBER
[2:48:15] <CybertronPrime> Ah, ok. I play on Diabolos, which used to be Primal but got moved to Crystal.
[2:48:18] <+metalsiren31> I honestly kinda wish there were just a handful more bosses like this
[2:48:19] <+Zepshire> personally I use keyboard for main content and controller for crafting and gathering
[2:48:20] <+mik255> fun fact: the bomb can one shot pat
[2:48:23] <suikudo> Just got here what i miss?
[2:48:23] <yosukecchi> mechanics? i'm a MNK i don't know em
[2:48:25] <$valriot> The only boss to ever have a mechanic
[2:48:38] <%yeknomlive> kill that spriggan
[2:48:40] <$OranHexthief> yeah no for those who don't have it heavensward is just free right now at least in NA
[2:48:42] <+cawi> Im told controller for fishing is good due to the vibration if you find fishing boring.
[2:48:44] <ColRedyx> It's really easy if you know it.
[2:48:45] <+Answer_Moose> I hated the server thing they did, I had friends on Cactuar I can't talk to anymore.

[2:48:52] <+thundiedramon> Pro strat advice; go and dance if you're a dps for this fight
[2:48:58] <+DAIROCKETTO> good thing i'm a healer so i don't have to pay attention to puzzle bosses!
[2:48:58] <yosukecchi> mechanics mean less DPS
[2:49:00] <ZimmiZ> I used to have problems with using a controller but I found a really good BLM crossbar guide and im super comfortable now
[2:49:02] <+jsb011> !server
[2:49:04] <ColRedyx> It will take you an HOUR if your group never figured out they can interact with the plunger.
[2:49:11] <%AquilaHarukaze> Remember, when you provoke make sure to follow up with a ranged attack or something, because if the healer so much as looks at you they'll pull it.
[2:49:15] <@lewdskeletor13> !discord
[2:49:16] <IFlaske> its true
[2:49:20] <%Piemen99> why does pat have so little health then he did when he was in the public places @AngriestPat

[2:49:23] <@lewdskeletor13> DansGame
[2:49:26] <+Answer_Moose> That taunts are weird in this game
[2:49:29] <$valriot> Yes i like it when Tanks acrually do their Job
[2:49:34] <Brainworm205> As a healer, can confirm, we do like it
[2:49:39] <%frsttcs> You forgot to tell them if your dps you ignore mechanics and do damage
[2:49:40] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Number 1 tank pro tip, marry the best healer you find so you can call dibs on the heals you're comfortable with
[2:49:45] <%cryobyjorn> Nah man healers love their heartrate randomly spiking

[2:50:47] <ColRedyx> @Redpointshine Pretty much no difference but performance.
[2:50:49] <+kuervojones> Pat, is FFIV a good game? and should I give it a whirly-whirl?
[2:50:49] <+allups> yo tht new MHW expansion though! HYPED
[2:50:50] <+NeonLight> farm the old ARR bosses for horsies
[2:50:57] <ColRedyx> @Redpointshine And the PS4 version performs just fine.
[2:50:59] <$valriot> @aquilaharukaze Its fine, Living Dead still exists and that move is fucking garbage, so Superbolide is fine
[2:51:09] <theobble> You can easily solo most HW dungeons
[2:51:09] <+Answer_Moose> @AngriestPat You should do the MHW boss for the stream too
[2:51:12] <%Ninestempest> Summoner can ssolo a lot of shit with titan lmao
[2:51:14] <%Fortegod> Fortegod subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[2:51:16] <%Lapinelis> Go solo Titan, pat
[2:51:20] <DetroitSentai> superbolide is fine if you and your healer arent braindead
[2:51:20] <+NeonLight> Ravana ex is totally soloable but outside of that its rough
[2:51:23] <+RushUnplugged> what you can't solo, you can definitely duo
[2:51:25] <%Lapinelis> Or Levathian, best ost
[2:51:26] <%LegendCobra> but what kinda loot would you do it for? wouldnt the gear be too shitty?
[2:51:26] <transporterthesequel> Do it for FAAAASHION
[2:51:28] <%AquilaHarukaze> That's fair
[2:51:31] <Angry_Ev1L> @Ninestempest not for long now Kappa
[2:51:37] <Nina96> is the monhun boss hard?
[2:51:38] <%Ninestempest> :(
[2:51:38] <+Answer_Moose> It's a dumb fun fight though
[2:51:41] <transporterthesequel> Old content I mean
[2:51:43] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Monster hunter fan being bad at monster hunter fight in a different game LUL
[2:51:44] <Guardiansaiyan> I was gone for a bit...is Pat shitting on FFXIV still?? CurseLit TwitchLit
[2:51:46] <Angry_Ev1L> @Nina96 not really
[2:51:48] <@SSaryn> apatCrazy
[2:51:51] <2DSuperiority> @legendcobra you glamor it for cosmetics
[2:51:54] <%a_lucky_soul> how do you gear up if you have no friends or a freecompany?
[2:51:55] <%yeknomlive> the monhun is special it ignores aggro, healers cant heal but you get potions
[2:51:56] <Guardiansaiyan> @Fortegod congrats!
[2:52:04] <koolaid_kevster> pat have you played any autochess?
[2:52:06] <kimikta> MrDestructoid MrDestructoid
[2:52:07] <ColRedyx> @Nina96 The extreme version is.
[2:52:07] <+Answer_Moose> @Reizie_Etherealm To be fair, it is not your typical fight.
[2:52:09] <+talfurt> When you are synched is the exp you get scaled your regular level
[2:52:10] <$valriot> I grinded thar fight for Rathalos mount then bought the Fat Cat mount a week later
[2:52:14] <Angry_Ev1L> @a_lucky_soul just run shit with randoms.
[2:52:16] <+Silentman0> oh god i just realized rathalos is going to be boring as hell as scholar soon
[2:52:16] <%Fortegod> Hey im at level 48 and i need to level up to play the next story quest what is the best way to level up
[2:52:25] <fireking900> dose the Exp scale with lvl sync?
[2:52:29] <+thundiedramon> @a_lucky_soul do dungeons and hope you get gear, ther's also msq giving you gear and going to the marketboard
[2:52:29] <%Lapinelis> Also, trying out controller Pat. Honestly, seems to work better than keyboard at my 20 hotkey kusts
[2:52:29] <ZimmiZ> i didnt know you could do that
[2:52:32] <Guardiansaiyan> @AngriestPat I got here late! I didn't know who you were shitting on...SORRY! <3
[2:52:33] <%Unlimited_> @talfurt yes
[2:52:34] <%Ninestempest> THe mechanics are easy lmao
[2:52:36] <%CitrusDrink> Mechanics you can safely ignore
[2:52:40] <%a_lucky_soul> ok
[2:52:42] <professorarcana> @Fortegod Palace of the Dead is good for leveling then
[2:52:43] <LeiaSkynoober> That’s such a cute maid dress
[2:52:46] <%yeknomlive> he's a burn boss
[2:52:49] <$SleepyMaribo> @a_lucky_soul randoms, luckily there are daily quests that high levels do, so you will get paired with high lvl players, you can also buy gear, item lvl 380 which is lvl 70 can be bought and crafted
[2:52:52] <ColRedyx> These early bosses are so weak that you can just ignore mechanics in the early dungeons.
[2:52:53] <Malziel> LUL
[2:52:53] <+Answer_Moose> The mechanics for this boss literally don't matter
[2:52:56] <%Ninestempest> the mechanics are kill the mobs before they bring in more mobs
[2:53:01] <%AquilaHarukaze> I just realized pat has the modded maid dress
[2:53:04] <%Fortegod> Thank you! @professorarcana
[2:53:11] <%LegendCobra> isnt he doing the mechanic rn
[2:53:11] <@lewdskeletor13> Whoop on that ass
[2:53:11] <%Ninestempest> Technically doesn't it not matter i fyou do it late or early
[2:53:12] <theobble> it's fine
[2:53:12] <professorarcana> No prob
[2:53:15] <+Silentman0> @fireking900 kind of. you don't get as much of a percentage of a level as you would have earlier, but you get much more than the numbers themselves would let you think
[2:53:16] <%Unlimited_> wait there is a option to turn off cutscenses?
[2:53:18] <Helghast102> it's not like you were going to get LB2 anyway
[2:53:18] <AdmiralButtloaf> melee LB1 is Braver
[2:53:21] <thetyrantcbass> Ooh, the lv48-50 quest gap. Try chain running FATEs if there aren’t side quests
[2:53:24] <%Reizie_Etherealm> @Answer_Moose To be fair that fight doesn't let you do most of the stuff in actual monster hunter like the damn dodge roll and super man dive or even the mantles so it's kinda unfair
[2:53:25] <@SSaryn> It's a DPS check
[2:53:30] <%killfrost11> the mechanic is to hit him untell he dies
[2:53:32] <%LegendCobra> its a dps race!!!
[2:53:33] <@SSaryn> Kappa
[2:53:33] <jay521> Looks like Gyges isnt so great afterall
[2:53:33] <+thundiedramon> @Unlimited_ there's a button to skip cutscees you've viewed already
[2:53:37] <+Answer_Moose> @you right
[2:53:46] <DetroitSentai> There is a mantle in the MH fight though
[2:53:47] <+Answer_Moose> @Reizie_Etherealm you right
[2:53:50] <+TheImmortal70> "There were mechanic here; they're gone now
[2:53:53] <@lewdskeletor13> @ssaryn Binch
[2:53:53] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@suikudo) (warning)
[2:53:55] <professorarcana> He moves away from the boss to breath
[2:54:02] <+Redpointshine> can you map a keyboard to the ps4 version? Because I don't think I wanna play an mmo with a gamepad
[2:54:04] <+SDT_Mercury> HIGH LEVEL TANK STRATS
[2:54:06] <pmtriox> unless he's one of those bosses which randomly targets dudes
[2:54:06] <suikudo> EVERYONE DO WHAT PAT DOES WHEN you tank
[2:54:10] <@SSaryn> @lewdskeletor13 whaddya MEME
[2:54:13] <ColRedyx> Whether or not you get hit is determined when the telegraphs disappear, NOT when the animation plays.
[2:54:19] <@JustinianKnight> pretty sure you can use keyboard on ps4 too
[2:54:20] <+thundiedramon> @Redpointshine Yes, you can hook up a keyboard and mouse to a PS4 and play like that
[2:54:21] <ColRedyx> The animation is PURELY cosmetic.
[2:54:22] <%yeknomlive> @Redpointshine yeah i used a m keyboard on ps4 for a long time
[2:54:24] <+RushUnplugged> tank >> enemies >> party is the ideal position
[2:54:26] <@SSaryn> Eyyyyy
[2:54:29] <%radda343> or he has mechanics where he moves
[2:54:29] <Maids4lyfe> whoa
[2:54:30] <Marpolo13> @suikudo but I like it when my group has to sweat
[2:54:35] <+Redpointshine> good to know
[2:54:36] <+Riseskimo> Is the DPS difference between Shadowbringers Tanks and DPS known?
[2:54:36] <ColRedyx> @JustinianKnight You can, but a friend of mine tried and there's input lag.
[2:54:36] <%CaptainKarite> Mothman is wearing it LUL
[2:54:39] <+mik255> has pat done his scratchoffs?
[2:54:40] <AllenDeadman> so the monk can play fucking DDR while punching the enemy
[2:54:40] <$valriot> GREED IT
[2:54:40] <%PanicSwytch> Idiots
[2:54:41] <Klefth> Man, the combat in this game still makes me kinda sad when compared to what 1.23 had :/
[2:54:47] <Nina96> u share loot?
[2:54:49] <@SSaryn> apatGib apatGib apatGib
[2:54:52] <Futurecity10> Of course everyone but pat is a female character
[2:54:53] <+ClaireBearz> always greed for those seals rooSip
[2:54:55] <+ElizzGlaster> @AngriestPat did that new event to run old content and get those new tomes start today?
[2:54:56] <@JustinianKnight> ah, yea personally I'd play controller no matter what anyways
[2:54:56] <baronvonkame> Hey Pat, super ready to get back into FFXIV the 28ths
[2:54:57] <Helghast102> Foestrikers is useless now because Brand new is free from the hall of the novice
[2:54:58] <+NeonLight> sometimes the visuals are that, some aoe attacks dont have that orange area and you do need to watch them
[2:54:59] <DetroitSentai> @Riseskimo no because potency is getting a rework and numbers are probably not final
[2:54:59] <misha_kastrilevich> How hard is it to play a MMO with a controller?
[2:54:59] <@mothmandraws> I was already wearing it
[2:55:00] <ColRedyx> @Redpointshine You should really give controller a try before you assume that. The controls are extremely smart and easy. There's also input lag on PS4 with a keyboard.
[2:55:01] <%Lapinelis> Greed it pat, exchange it for seals and laugh at the scrubs
[2:55:01] <Angry_Ev1L> @Riseskimo no but I bet it will be comparable to how it is now
[2:55:02] <ShichiNoBushi> If it's Elmo, not over the FF victory music.
[2:55:02] <Themanlevan> Crazy talk. One is wearing it
[2:55:03] <%Fortegod> Thanks for getting me back into ff14 @AngriestPat
[2:55:05] <+samuraijoe_> pat what does "ROLL" mean?
[2:55:12] <%yeknomlive> remember casting shields and casting 1 handeds
[2:55:13] <+JadeKapa> Hey Pat, do you do Disciple of Land/Hand stuff? What would you recommend levelling for Shadowbringers?
[2:55:16] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> dancing
[2:55:17] <RadShiro> @AngriestPat hey pat are you changning into a big cat man for ShB
[2:55:17] <+thundiedramon> Everyone rolls a number between 1-99 to get the gear
[2:55:19] <+Answer_Moose> @AngriestPat I am a bit surprised you don't have mentor queue unlocked though. I figured you would have by now.
[2:55:21] <Guardiansaiyan> @Futurecity10 because Pat is true to himself!
[2:55:21] <expressnode> Holy shit you type fast
[2:55:21] <+SDT_Mercury> @AngriestPat what server are you on?
[2:55:27] <AdmiralButtloaf> @AngriestPat do shiva
[2:55:29] <thetyrantcbass> Foestriker is a good low level glamour if nothing else
[2:55:30] <+thundiedramon> Need = job that can use the gear has highest priority for the 1-99
[2:55:30] <+Valison> @angriestpat I remember you mentioning that the 1-50 story quests suck, when are they supposed to be good, hevansward?
[2:55:31] <+Sir_gonthorian> what professions would you recommend for new lvl 70 player
[2:55:33] <%MegboyManuel> Run a Trial dude to show neat shit
[2:55:33] <Soulsbjorne> remeber cross class leveling to unlock jobs
[2:55:33] <+talfurt> I heard you get stormblood if you preorder shadowbringers is that true
[2:55:36] <+thundiedramon> Greed = less priority but can still roll
[2:55:39] <+thundiedramon> Pass is obvious
[2:55:39] <+Linktheserf> Remember that Japanese movie where a kid buys FF online for his dad and they bond in the game world?? Good times.
[2:55:39] <%radda343> best Primal waifu: Lakshmi or Shiva?
[2:55:41] <%MegboyManuel> Do Trial
[2:55:42] <%PanicSwytch> Roll means you are bidding to own the loot
[2:55:42] <justafoxhere> @misha_kastrilevich actually not too bad at least with this one
[2:55:44] <ColRedyx> @samuraijoe_ In an MMO, it means like rolling the dice. You "roll" on loot to try and obtain it in groups and the player who rolls highest wins it.
[2:55:44] <%Mawarup> REJOICE
[2:55:44] <Angry_Ev1L> ACTUALLY do shiva at least
[2:55:45] <Nina96> whats a light party?
[2:55:45] <$valriot> Pals-adin
[2:55:47] <%Shady_Squid> Welp, officially re-downloading f14 to give it another shot. Thanks pat
[2:55:51] <%yeknomlive> suzaku
[2:55:51] <$Valdorick> Oh wait, a real question with no sarcasm for once @AngriestPat - I tank in WoW, and I have to worry about "Toe stepping asshole" bosses, who like to take steps forward even if I don't move; how's the Toe Stepping in FF14?
[2:55:55] <@lewdskeletor13> You have pals? Kappa
[2:55:56] <DetroitSentai> Light party is 4, full party is 8
[2:55:58] <%MegboyManuel> Trial for big show of neat stuff
[2:55:59] <Nordguy> is there a dark party?
[2:55:59] <%Lapinelis> @talfurt If oyu get the newest DLC you get all the DLC. But only once the newest DLC unlocks
[2:56:00] <Angry_Ev1L> @AngriestPat do shiva or suzaku
[2:56:01] <%snow_bush> @samuraijoe_ When you get loot for the party, everyone that tries to get it rolls a random number between 1-100. I think the higher number wins in FF14
[2:56:01] <baronvonkame> @AngriestPat can I reccommend jadoe stoa, best fight in the game ot show off Kappa
[2:56:01] <+Riseskimo> @Angry_Ev1L @DetroitSentai thank you for the answers! how much difference is there currently? i never used a dps meter (if there even is one)

[2:56:47] <%Shady_Squid> Susano-o? Like the persona?
[2:56:49] <CyndaneTierney> Susano-o is why I started tanking. Tanking that fight is so fun.
[2:56:49] <%Ninestempest> @Klefth the word you want is stat bloat
[2:56:49] <+Grizzytron> Oh man Susano was such a fucking shock to me as a new player leveling to 70
[2:56:50] <+samuraijoe_> pat what about commendations?
[2:56:51] <joeobo2> This fight was always great
[2:56:52] <+Linktheserf> Is this Pat trying to sell FF 14 to me? Lol
[2:56:57] <%Shadowthedigger> @samuraijoe_ Rolling is clicking one of those three buttons. Need means you can equip the item and want priority, greed means you want it but either don't or can't trump everyone else, and pass passes. Then you get a 1 to 99 die roll that compares to everyone else that rolled that. If people needed it one of them get it, otherwise greed is used.
[2:56:57] <zamzoph> like Naruto?
[2:56:57] <Angry_Ev1L> @Riseskimo you can use said fflogs to check DPS.

[2:57:55] <LandOfTheWay> @AngriestPat do you have a favorite trial/raid boss?
[2:57:57] <indig0bird> Awww, yeah, Octavia is wearing my favourite mail!
[2:57:58] <%CaptainKarite> BONUS
[2:57:58] <+SDT_Mercury> AW FUCK YEAH SUSANOO
[2:57:59] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> yay bonus
[2:58:00] <+jsb011> bonus of pain sometimes
[2:58:00] <%TheShal> B-b-bonus!
[2:58:01] <Sloavon> SourPls
[2:58:04] <baronvonkame> HW best story tbh
[2:58:04] <professorarcana> I always skip the cutscene because I hate inconveniencing people by making them wait :/
[2:58:06] <Angry_Ev1L> @Riseskimo For example if DPS does 7-8k DPS Tanks will do 3-5k
[2:58:08] <indig0bird> High Steel/Valerian
[2:58:08] <%JGardner88> What have I missed since he started?
[2:58:10] <%radda343> I see that AST in AF gear
[2:58:13] <DetroitSentai> @Riseskimo Like if a tank out damages a DPS then someone is playing bad or got really unlucky, Gear also accounts for this too
[2:58:15] <+metalsiren31> This boss is so beast as tank
[2:58:19] <+BioHunter> heavenward is free as well
[2:58:21] <MaeMae94> That's why the party wasn't mad at me for watching the cutscene?! 'Cause they get a bonus?! That's fucking awesome!
[2:58:28] <ShichiNoBushi> That's a good practice.
[2:58:31] <+HelloImTom08> @professorarcana naw man you pay the sub you watch the cutscence
[2:58:33] <yosukecchi> oh wow his english voice
[2:58:33] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> hype
[2:58:34] <pmtriox> which makes early adopting kinda stupid, but whatever
[2:58:34] <r_Foeburden87> BEGIN
[2:58:35] <+Qsmash_> Shadowbringers comes with Heavensward and Stormblood
[2:58:36] <+demoncleanr> short answer: play the free trial then buy the base game then preorder/buy shadowbringers
[2:58:39] <ColRedyx> Basically, you can trial the game for free up to level 35 with NO TIME LIMIT right now, and just buy the Shadowbringers complete edition when that comes out. You will get the game and every expansion for regular price.
[2:58:40] <%Divryne> WILD AND PURE.
[2:58:40] <+RushUnplugged> basegame includes all but the last expansion to be out, then you just buy that
[2:58:40] <+Answer_Moose> sbfpYeyeye sbfpYeyeye sbfpYeyeye sbfpYeyeye sbfpYeyeye sbfpYeyeye sbfpYeyeye sbfpYeyeye sbfpYeyeye
[2:58:42] <%Divryne> AND FOREVER FREE.
[2:58:46] <%MrBorisMakarov> BIG NUMBERS
[2:58:49] <$valriot> EARTH AND SEA
[2:58:51] <ShichiNoBushi> I don't want to pay $20 - $40 per expansion when there are 3 or 5.
[2:58:52] <Xelhesia> heavensward best story stormblood best villian and character moments/growth
[2:58:54] <theobble> The seas part for WE ALONE!
[2:58:55] <$OranHexthief> yeah complete is not worth right now cause you can just get starters then heavensward for free and then buy stormblood
[2:58:56] <%Shady_Squid> This guy's design is pretty sick
[2:59:02] <+NeonLight> Its the reverse of WoW: Blizzard lumps all the old expacs with the base game, this one has the base game, then -and-everything-else
[2:59:07] <Daniel_Is_I> @AngriestPat When you're leveling as a healer/tank is it fastest to just spam dungeons and ignore quests?
[2:59:07] <ZimmiZ> RushUnplugged nope thats not right. base game is only the base game.
[2:59:10] <dickbuttwoman> Heh, was just doing some dungeons and drop back to my favorite fight
[2:59:17] <$Valdorick> Never look at a bosses balls - if you see is the boss' balls, you're tanking wrong, pull out your camera.
[2:59:21] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@dickbuttwoman) (warning)
[2:59:25] <ColRedyx> This isn't even the coolest boss in SB. Kreygasm
[2:59:27] <EmoLlama97> which data center is pat on?
[2:59:27] <%yeknomlive> gotta love the fights that have instant death falls

[2:59:42] <+thundiedramon> He's pressing it, he's just in grit lol
[2:59:49] <Clyderso> THE SEAS PART
[2:59:52] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 3 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 12oz (360mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[2:59:53] <%MegboyManuel> STACK
[2:59:56] <+sourceofall> your messing up the melees dps by turning the boss like that
[2:59:59] <Marpolo13> but it's orange !
[2:59:59] <Angry_Ev1L> @Daniel_Is_I if you're doing main story for the first time it will be enough for leveling. If not - yeah dungeons for tanks especially
[3:00:01] <@mothmandraws> the orange light calls to me

[3:03:02] <+Fynale> MAKE WAY
[3:03:03] <+Hobojo153> Yeah I stopped with controller because I don't like not having all my buttons at once. Now I use a Logitech mouse with it's extra button set to ctrl, so I've got like 4 hot bars at all times.

[3:03:18] <%radda343> tankbuster
[3:03:20] <Covil91> Susano and Ravana would be BFFs
[3:03:20] <CybertronPrime> @jack_nightshadow Fancy meeting you here.
[3:03:21] <%yeknomlive> tip for ranged dps help your tanks out with a def buff
[3:03:23] <+thundiedramon> Cup game now
[3:03:24] <+Armeggadon> And now the music changes, one of my favorite parts of the trials is the music changing with phases
[3:03:24] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> Tank Buster is cooler
[3:03:25] <+Answer_Moose> Big hit that pat didn't use a good cd for the tankbuster
[3:03:25] <Helghast102> who the FUCK says tank crush
[3:03:29] <+RushUnplugged> You usually have tanks do it because everybody else has to dps the sword to stop it
[3:03:30] <thetyrantcbass> Susan and Ravana brofisting in the aether
[3:03:34] <%Ninestempest> probably everquset or some other dumb shit mmo
[3:03:36] <Angry_Ev1L> rip
[3:03:38] <ssks123> tank buster is a cooler term therefore it is the correct one
[3:03:38] <%Ninestempest> says tank crush
[3:03:39] <Jack_Nightshadow> I go where I please
[3:03:40] <+NeonLight> Even WoW community calls it a tankbuster iirc
[3:03:41] <%Ninestempest> I've never heard of that
[3:03:42] <+alcieta> tide pod LUL
[3:03:43] <+Grizzytron> the absolute balls of that bard
[3:03:46] <%ShogunNoonto> i have never hear someone call it a tank crash
[3:03:47] <%Ninestempest> YEAH TIDE PODS
[3:03:49] <+NeonLight> And WoW and XIV have different terms even for aggro
[3:03:56] <+alcieta> omg do orbonne monastery
[3:03:57] <+BioHunter> never heard tank crush
[3:04:00] <%Ninestempest> i think xiv uses enmity for copy right reasons, maybe
[3:04:01] <professorarcana> Tank Is Not Crush
[3:04:01] <Soulsbjorne> What is that bard doing?!
[3:04:04] <KatabolicRage> everyone says aggro, nobody says enmity

[3:06:49] <+NeonLight> Try out Ordonne for a 24 man
[3:06:51] <%Ninestempest> @Klefth power creep more refers to how metas change and leave old options in the past as less good, despite not actually being changed. Old content is easy just because it's being out leveled. Even then, most extreme/savage stuff has instant-kill mechanics you still have to pay attention to anyway
[3:06:54] <%free_7> can you show off a 24-man

[3:06:55] <+alcieta> not what Pat did LUL
[3:07:00] <+miguelrod777> Report tank for dying
[3:07:00] <%Kisabuza> tanking is no more difficult than dps, it can just be kind of stressful since its all on you and one other person typically
[3:07:01] <+Angrec> dont forget how there is a line down the center and one person gets rooted and blows up and the rest have to swap to the other side back and forth
[3:07:01] <$valriot> Do Omega scarfDab scarfDab
[3:07:02] <ShichiNoBushi> Be kind and rewind.
[3:07:05] <+RushUnplugged> @EvilSoully there are some excellent youtubers that make video tutorials, watching those is usually enough to learn tank mechanics

[3:07:40] <dickbuttwoman> The off tank hits provoke. The Full tank hits shirk. The Off tank becomes the full tank. Provoke puts you at Highest enmity -1. Shirk shifts 25% of enmity to the target

[3:07:55] <Guardiansaiyan> @laazybulbasaur congrats
[3:08:05] <Soulsbjorne> I think you should have tohave leveld a tank class to 50 before allowing people to try gunbreaker just my opinion
[3:08:10] <+max_byer> Elmo is such a good tank, get him in there!
[3:08:10] <+Dogfootjoe> anyone else video feed dead?
[3:08:12] <+NeonLight> Gunbreaker is strange: it plays like a dps, that just happens to have defense CDs
[3:08:12] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> hey hey hey
[3:08:14] <%Ninestempest> @Klefth content being made strictly vertically isn't the same as the meta of Pokemon leaving pokemon in gen 4 in the dust, while gen 6-7 suff is OP, despite not much actually changing for old stuff.
[3:08:14] <@SSaryn> *use shirk on the other tank first tho*
[3:08:22] <ZimmiZ> @AngriestPat how do you know who is main tank or off tank?
[3:08:23] <haisho> I thought the off-tank said YOUR MOTHER
[3:08:24] <%Divryne> Yes use Shirk too.
[3:08:26] <Jack_Nightshadow> shirk is after provoke
[3:08:27] <sidstyler> Fuck you, bitch! It's ME! zoneRage
[3:08:27] <+Zepshire> What about shirk
[3:08:27] <+Dessbocito2> voke first shirk after, not the other way around
[3:08:28] <+thundiedramon> @NeonLight truthfully that's all tanks
[3:08:31] <+cawi> ifrit EX requires tank swaps
[3:08:31] <dickbuttwoman> Ssaryn, I thought it was after?
[3:08:31] <Helghast102> also provoke is not an aggro skills, it's top of enmity list +1
[3:08:32] <theobble> shirk pat
[3:08:33] <KatabolicRage> main tank is the guy being punched in the face by the boss
[3:08:33] <+thundiedramon> they're just blue dps
[3:08:34] <AzureFlame98> Dont forget about "Shirk"ing your duty too
[3:08:35] <smward87> that's gonna be every tank in ShB @NeonLight
[3:08:38] <%TombstoneTTromboners> wrong
[3:08:38] <ItIsSky> don't you have to be level 60 to unlock gunbreaker though?
[3:08:39] <+Hobojo153> @Soulsbjorne You probably will have to get someone to 50 at least
[3:08:39] <pmtriox> usually role
[3:08:40] <@SSaryn> @dickbuttwoman It is, I'm an idiot.
[3:08:40] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> dying is a canadian tank swap
[3:08:41] <%TombstoneTTromboners> you play chicken
[3:08:42] <$DarkKnightGrave> IT WAS ME BITCH
[3:08:44] <%AquilaHarukaze> The person who pops tank stance first to assert cominance
[3:08:44] <+Riseskimo> @AngriestPat how do you use tanking cooldowns correctly? since there are many abilities, how do you know what to keep and what to use, especially since they have differing cooldowns and you'd possibly wanted to have the highest possible uptime
[3:08:45] <troytaco> they'll have tank stance ;/
[3:08:47] <%Ninestempest> @Klefth like Power Creep is a word you use for card games and stuff that uses old content for a long time
[3:08:47] <$Valdorick> The tanks will discuss it - sometimes.
[3:08:50] <Jack_Nightshadow> So its the BRD
[3:08:51] <yosukecchi> top and bottom tanks
[3:08:52] <EVOriginal> @AngriestPat Can you explain your DRK rotation? I've been out of the game for a bit.
[3:08:54] <+Bad1uck> You measure dicks at the start to see who is MT
[3:08:58] <pandangerous> I can just sprinkle provoke in for more enmity right Kappa
[3:08:59] <+FennecZephyr> The main tank is the one best at taking aggro
[3:09:00] <$valriot> The one who doesnt change to Tank stance is the off tank
[3:09:00] <SailingSaturn> BLM is MT cirSlain
[3:09:02] <indig0bird> Look up who has aggro stance activated
[3:09:02] <%Kenori> Just beat Sekiro and I NEVER WANNA PLAY THIS GAME AGAIN
[3:09:02] <GambolMuse> Certain tanks also tend to pull first, at least in high end content
[3:09:04] <Basch71> tanks usually call shotgun with their sword
[3:09:05] <+Hobojo153> Well you can tell by stance, for now. Aren't those leaving
[3:09:08] <Mr_Strut> How do you track your DKP?
[3:09:09] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Look at their stance icon among the status icons
[3:09:12] <+Greywyn00> can you do dun scaith to show off a cool alliance raid?
[3:09:13] <AdmiralButtloaf> WAR makes better OT
[3:09:13] <+the22cstomp> the tank who is a natural bottom is the one who is the main tank because they like getting spanked
[3:09:13] <+NeonLight> Gunbreaker feels like it started as a dps class, others feel like theres still utility
[3:09:14] <TheSinner42> who has tank buff = MT
[3:09:16] <zamzoph> @AngriestPat what does the non-tanking tank do in the meantime?
[3:09:18] <silvcrest> STANCES ARE DEAD
[3:09:18] <SailingSaturn> @Kenori congrats! cirPat
[3:09:19] <Copperama> OOOH Pat's playing the MMO he sold everyone on including me like a real sketchy car sales man
[3:09:22] <@mothmandraws> T POSE
[3:09:23] <+democrazyyy> do you have any tips for getting over tank-xiety? I've tried for years in multiple games (wow/FF14/rift) to tank and can never bring myself to actually do group content for fear of fucking up
[3:09:25] <@mothmandraws> ESTABLISH DOMINANCE
[3:09:28] <Onamar> FEL CLEEEEEEEEAVE
[3:09:29] <%Kisabuza> i dont know about ff14 but many raid bosses have swap mechanics pretty frequently throughout the fight, pretty much meaning both people are main tanks
[3:09:31] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> what is that disgusting creature
[3:09:33] <theobble> Unless you're doing o10s in which case the boss will decide who is mt
[3:09:38] <TheNocturnalScotsman> pld will shield oath
[3:09:39] <transporterthesequel> You are the hardiest DPS
[3:09:41] <korean_random> I like how MMORPG boss mechanics become a fucking clusterfuck of fuck - just a bunch of different colored boxes on the floor overlaid on each other and changing each second. You'll never see anything like this in any other game
[3:09:41] <haveswordmuststing> theres a big A on the name of who's got aggro, let them main tank
[3:09:41] <dickbuttwoman> Lol, WAR pre-pull shirk off so that MT can do more damage. So much masturbation
[3:09:42] <Derkinstacker> Using your tank stance establishes dominance. It signals confidence.
[3:09:42] <+Hobojo153> Also stun sometimes
[3:09:44] <%OdysseyKnight> They become DPS and insurance
[3:09:47] <+RushUnplugged> warriors like to showoff but then they get too scared to actually MT
[3:09:48] <transporterthesequel> So you can fuck up and not die!
[3:09:50] <WaitHowDidIGetHere> @desudesudokidoki His name is Pat.
[3:09:50] <%yeknomlive> usually
[3:09:51] <$valriot> Also use Support cooldowns on the Tank and Party @angriestpat
[3:09:53] <suikudo> Tell that to my 8 fell cleaves
[3:09:55] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> LUL
[3:09:55] <%Lammchen> @angriestpat do you use shaders or anything? I can’t tell from my phone screen
[3:10:02] <Guardiansaiyan> @AngriestPat what about DSP
[3:10:03] <%Reizie_Etherealm> A substitute on the bench waiting to be tagged in
[3:10:03] <+alphonseisbest> War say fuck ur dps
[3:10:07] <AdmiralButtloaf> @transporterthesequel physical dps have more hp than casters
[3:10:08] <$Valdorick> If your off-tank is the highest DPS for an extended period of time, then you will meet what is called the "Enrage Timer" - this is bad. You will die.
[3:10:09] <@SpaceCaptainCrone> I just treat the MT like an extended defensive buff.
[3:10:12] <%AquilaHarukaze> PLD who know to use intervention and cover make for great offtanks
[3:10:16] <pmtriox> same engine FF13 used actually
[3:10:17] <%Trias801> Trias801 subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[3:10:18] <%TheSniperJoe> Off tanks do damage, pick up adds, handle mechanics like those floating orbs and use support abilities to help out the tank and healers.
[3:10:19] <+max_byer> Elmo's the main tank
[3:10:20] <+ZweihanderSteve> So off tank is a backup essentially
[3:10:22] <EMMerc> how do you turn off cutscenes
[3:10:23] <%TombstoneTTromboners> MT priority: PLD > DRK > WAR

[3:10:27] <Guardiansaiyan> @Trias801 congrats
[3:10:27] <+Riseskimo> @AngriestPat how do you use tanking cooldowns correctly? since there are many abilities, how do you know what to keep and what to use, especially since they have differing cooldowns and you'd possibly wanted to have the highest possible uptime
[3:10:29] <Nina96> @AngriestPat how do u or can u dye gear?

[3:10:30] <@mothmandraws> elmo screams do draw aggro
[3:10:30] <%jiin6> LOVE HIM
[3:10:31] <+mik255> off tank also picks up adds
[3:10:32] <ShichiNoBushi> Because you're aggroing him.

[3:10:34] <+thundiedramon> @TombstoneTTromboners that's actually the reverse
[3:10:35] <ZaDoorman> unless you're a warrior, than you're DPS AND Tank by default
[3:10:36] <ZimmiZ> ok
[3:10:36] <%Reizie_Etherealm> PLD has so much damage reduction and party utility it's great
[3:10:37] <%Leodude> @AngriestPat Third party programs?
[3:10:37] <LandOfTheWay> @AngriestPat do you have a favorite trial/raid boss?
[3:10:37] <%laazybulbasaur> Any advice for newcomers?
[3:10:38] <dickbuttwoman> It's a backup, and in some fights they have specific mechanics
[3:10:38] <@Velyndra> wrong. WAR is best MT
[3:10:39] <@SSaryn> Now tell people how to do Kefka EX
[3:10:39] <+Hobojo153> Elmo drawing chats aggro
[3:10:39] <+Answer_Moose> @TheSniperJoe We gotta stop following each other around.
[3:10:40] <%TheShal> Hey Pat, did you explain the target circle underneath the enemy yet?
[3:10:44] <@Velyndra> but only in late game
[3:10:47] <%Lammchen> Default? This looks better than I thought it would lol.
[3:10:49] <@Velyndra> cause you dont need to sit in tank stance
[3:10:55] <@Velyndra> but thats when you know what youre doing
[3:10:56] <+miguelrod777> why does your butt smell

[3:11:20] <%spiritofmojave> PS4 is atleast consistent 30
[3:11:20] <+Bad1uck> @democrazyyy Try tanking with people you know so you can get comfortable, then when you have confidence/learn to not care, try duty finder
[3:11:21] <Soulsbjorne> has he explained the threat bars next to peoples names in party list
[3:11:21] <%killfrost11> ps4 verson runs awsome

[3:19:45] <Clyderso> nom
[3:19:54] <vVAstrAVv> dont research bosses learn them yourself
[3:20:09] <%Keeble24> for a sec i thought your mic was muted for some reason
[3:20:30] <shotgang86> this is the first time that I ever see this game in action
[3:20:32] <Helghast102> nobody counts the seconds, they base it on GCD typically
[3:20:35] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Oh that's next gen tech
[3:20:41] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Didn't know that
[3:20:42] <zamzoph> can't remember everything NotLikeThis
[3:20:58] <+mrshazboto> Dear Dr. Pat, I played for a few months a while ago and got bard to mid 40s before petering out and starting warframe. Paid for heavensward because it came with something like 30-60 days of gameplay and figured i'd actually play through that content...I was wrong. Been interested in going back, but I forgot my email that I used. Should I bother going through support to figure out which email I used so I can start again?
[3:21:01] <horsesaredumb> poor frog
[3:21:15] <theobble> @Venhammer The first boss of any given tier will be on par or easier than an ex trial. After that it depends on the tier 10s I'd say is about the same as an ex. Past that it gets harder. All of omega I cleared the first two fights of any given tier either on the first day or within the week.
[3:21:16] <+cawi> savage 3 boss tank buster always crits.
[3:21:16] <+Grayhammatter> rampert

[3:21:42] <ZaDoorman> @grayhammatter 5.0 pre order minion
[3:21:45] <ShichiNoBushi> And you don't play on on TV.
[3:21:51] <DublinRage> @Roundelay11 that is one of his mind goblins given corporeal form
[3:21:55] <%DXLelouch24> Tanking is muscle memory dont bother remembering ittl come too you
[3:21:55] <GenericTwitchAcc1> @AngriestPat Pat have you been keeping up with the r/gmaeofthrones charity drama? That's some tasty shit right there
[3:21:57] <Binarypony> only features that would be restricted are like your characters birthday and god
[3:22:01] <+mik255> early game is toture
[3:22:03] <%CaptainKarite> YES, I had to do that and it took like 5 minutes
[3:22:07] <%TheSniperJoe> Support might take awhile to get someone but they are VERY helpful and can fix a wide range of problems.
[3:22:08] <%Venhammer> @theobble Ok, been wanting to try it, I like EX but after a few fights it gets really easy once I learn the dance, wanted to try savage in Shadowbringers

[3:38:59] <thetyrantcbass> BLU right now is less a job than a side mode
[3:39:00] <DetroitSentai> Best job
[3:39:00] <%OdysseyKnight> Black Mage is the easiest job to start with but it gets really hard to manage later on
[3:39:01] <%spiritofmojave> Nice
[3:39:01] <CuriousReborn> LUL
[3:39:03] <@SSaryn> Remember when we had to get Blood for Blood at DRG Lv35. Good times.

[3:39:04] <%Lapinelis> Why do you hate BLM?
[3:39:05] <+mik255> black mage is fun tho
[3:39:12] <%TheShal> BLM is the best job in the game
[3:39:12] <+cawi> I leveled DRG just for blood for blood. Then they took it away
[3:39:12] <Angry_Ev1L> Remember when we had to lvl other jobs to get role skills? oh the times

[3:39:16] <andyspz> summoners rise up
[3:39:17] <hooooooooly_shiiiiiiiiiit> fuck black...... mages
[3:39:17] <KatabolicRage> black mage is a tactical nuke, did a black mage steal aggro from you or something?
[3:39:18] <moogleboy1984> Why do you hate the best DPS class?
[3:39:21] <+Vanic_Venator> Black Mage was my first class way back
[3:39:21] <ZimmiZ> thats my main BibleThump
[3:39:21] <%TheSniperJoe> Black Mage is very powerful, Pat is being Salty.
[3:39:23] <vVAstrAVv> how can you hate it you barely ever played it

[3:39:41] <%CitrusDrink> @AngriestPat I wanna try out Gunbreaker once it's out but I've never tanked before, do you think I'd be ok jumping in and joining queues at 50/60 or whatever it starts at or should I do some practice runs with a lower level class first to make sure I know what I'm doing?
[3:39:43] <%NWR_James> They run too far forward and get everyone killed

[3:40:37] <@SSaryn> If you're a BLM, I probably already hate you since I'm a healer btw.
[3:40:42] <Covil91> HEalers are the only people watching everyone else fuck up
[3:40:43] <Madbearv> tanking is the best
[3:40:44] <$OmegaWeltall> he's not wrong abotu hearlers. but Pat is super wrong about BLM though... BLM is great
[3:40:48] <%xemnahort> He’s right I have become a monster and I fucking love it #healer4life
[3:40:48] <%OdysseyKnight> and not dying
[3:40:48] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> is it like herding cats
[3:40:51] <@mothmandraws> ssaryn adjust your feelings towards them
[3:40:52] <$valriot> @angriestpat Literally mained Healer for 3 years, and im a cunt, so im tanking in Shadowbringers now, i cant deal with it anymore
[3:40:57] <haveswordmuststing> i met one of those Salt white mage baby
[3:40:59] <Angry_Ev1L> Pat is right about BLMs
[3:41:00] <@SSaryn> @mothmandraws THEY WILL DIE.
[3:41:01] <aeonicvector> Healer has the problem of you LITERALLY cant save it if THEY screw it up too hard, your a stopgap who cant fix it
[3:41:01] <IFlaske> absorb mistakes
[3:41:02] <%Arnschen> Yes
[3:41:02] <+Doculus> Healer's job is to adjust!
[3:41:02] <%Ninestempest> @SSaryn nah, BLM is fine cause they can actually do enough damage to make up for a few extra heals. DRG on th eother hand...
[3:41:04] <Marpolo13> DONT STAND IN THE FIRE SwiftRage

[3:41:17] <Angry_Ev1L> now imagine being BLM and not having top DPS... now this is a real problem
[3:41:17] <Kurochiooo> But manawall!
[3:41:18] <%jiin6> the Healer is the IT of your party
[3:41:18] <Kodpol> @AngriestPat is there a rogue like class like in World of Warcraft?
[3:41:18] <jin_the_medic> not a ff14 question, but do you plan on doing anything with Code Vein?
[3:41:18] <+Innocuous_Goat> And you get no commendations for your trouble
[3:41:19] <%Ninestempest> YEAP
[3:41:20] <+Cardz_> LOL DRG
[3:41:20] <Basch71> that shit infuriates me
[3:41:20] <%frsttcs> I hadn't played for a long time and my inventory/armoury is a fucking mess and I don't know to start
[3:41:20] <+ch0ob> Why u gotta say DRG :(
[3:41:20] <Jarvanii> but then also if healer dies it's all fucked
[3:41:20] <+HelloImTom08> Healer knows why and who is completely shit LUL
[3:41:21] <+ClaireBearz> healers are playing against their parties own stupidity
[3:41:22] <theobble> but muh parse
[3:41:22] <KruelDestiny> FeelsBadMan
[3:41:23] <+Hobojo153> They clean up your oopsies
[3:41:23] <Madbearv> let dps die
[3:41:27] <supuhmagikarp> True facts
[3:41:27] <%spiritofmojave> That DRG jumped into the orange :)
[3:41:29] <@SSaryn> DRG has gotten better. BLM continues to be a meme.
[3:41:29] <+Silentman0> (note: none of what he's saying applies to scholars. scholars are dps who have healer pets)
[3:41:29] <@JustinianKnight> NIN,BRD, and MCH also give out buffs etc
[3:41:30] <DetroitSentai> BLM also has tons of movement with procs and slidecasts that you shouldnt be getting hit that often
[3:41:30] <Xelhesia> healer is the mommy
[3:41:32] <@JustinianKnight> so...
[3:41:32] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@EvilSoully) (warning)
[3:41:34] <$valriot> I HATE ITTTTT
[3:41:34] <%Arnschen> "Oh...it's you"
[3:41:34] <+DrunkenDice> welcome to the life of a healer :)
[3:41:38] <ItsKitKat_> YUP
[3:41:41] <%Ninestempest> >I'm in this picture and I don't like it
[3:41:41] <+HelloImTom08> Healer is a baby sitter
[3:41:44] <thetyrantcbass> Healer is true pvp
[3:41:46] <@SSaryn> Rescue is also used for memes.
[3:41:48] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> LUL team mommy
[3:41:49] <@SpaceCaptainCrone> The experienced Healer response to these things is "THEN PERISH"
[3:41:49] <%EvilSoully> BUt AoEs are so pretty Pat, they call to my DRG brain
[3:41:49] <+RaziWraith> NO PAT! That's not how it works!!! I only heal the tank. If you get dmg as dps you are wrong!!! LUL
[3:41:49] <$valriot> Pull them off a cliff
[3:41:49] <+DAIROCKETTO> please just wait for five seconds so i can recover some mp between fights
[3:41:50] <Basch71> This is true
[3:41:51] <dickbuttwoman> And if you DON'T fix them, it's very obvious, cause they die
[3:41:51] <Neo_Kaiser> Use rescue as you jump off a cliff
[3:41:52] <+Grayhammatter> healer is just a babysitter
[3:41:56] <+Innocuous_Goat> "I'm here to help you idiots, stop screwing up so hard" is something I've thought more than once
[3:41:58] <supuhmagikarp> rescue is the best thing that ever hapened for healers
[3:42:02] <Angry_Ev1L> HEALERS ADJUST
[3:42:03] <aeonicvector> Healer is See everyones mistakes + be unable to fix everything
[3:42:05] <haveswordmuststing> DRG whole job is to stand still and die
[3:42:07] <+Bad1uck> Rescue is amazing, like slapping tehm across the face and saying "stop fucking up!"
[3:42:09] <%Ninestempest> That is false, I love seeing good DPS top the chart while avoiding mechanics
[3:42:12] <+alcieta> use rescue from opposite side of Suzaku void LUL
[3:42:14] <redial_nick> everyone is stupid but me
[3:42:16] <$valriot> I cant unsee it even when ive swapped over to playing a Tank
[3:42:17] <Basch71> we pay attention to health bars more than anyone
[3:42:19] <@mothmandraws> meme squad
[3:42:19] <%TaifuDragon> I am a monument to all your sins
[3:42:20] <haveswordmuststing> i should know, i maxed one out
[3:42:21] <+HelloImTom08> I could only heal for one raid set, it was so annoying knowing who was bad LUL
[3:42:24] <+Double_Tap_That> I wanted to help people, but now I just want to murder them.
[3:42:24] <+guyalex> healer main, yes you all suck

[3:42:31] <%Blackgaver> Kreygasm
[3:42:32] <theobble> ninja has at least 3
[3:42:32] <+ch0ob> Kreygasm
[3:42:34] <@SSaryn> If you like moving a lot, boi is Monk gonna be your class.
[3:42:37] <IFlaske> every GCD on monk is a positional i think
[3:42:37] <+Hobojo153> Either die the hero or live to become the villain
[3:42:38] <$valriot> DPS is for dumb fucks, except Machinist, which is for dumb bitch energy
[3:42:39] <Binarypony> monk is all positionals
[3:42:39] <%NWR_James> they're fisting its butt
[3:42:40] <%Ninestempest> STICKS
[3:42:41] <+Innocuous_Goat> I love being healer, I like helping people, but being a healer does things to you
[3:42:42] <dickbuttwoman> Fist it
[3:42:42] <%OdysseyKnight> If you around the front as a melee DPS you are bad
[3:42:43] <%Blackgaver> so much booty work
[3:42:44] <Binarypony> but monk is fast
[3:42:47] <%spiritofmojave> Fist that ass

[3:43:00] <haveswordmuststing> its like being a Medic Main in tf2, its a thankless, complicated, painful job to do
[3:43:00] <@mothmandraws> and bard can move alot
[3:43:00] <@SSaryn> Sticks that you throw he says.
[3:43:01] <Binarypony> bard is real fun
[3:43:01] <+Hobojo153> Also they sing to you
[3:43:02] <rekinom> bow magic instead of magic magic
[3:43:02] <dickbuttwoman> BRD is best class
[3:43:03] <%Blackgaver> that you throw
[3:43:03] <Mexicanskydiver> "whO cArEss JuSt dO YoUr jOb aND HeAlzZZ"- people who dont appreciate the healer.
[3:43:03] <+Dragonslaved> monk main here, they are 90% positionals and very fast
[3:43:05] <KatabolicRage> ranged dps generally are very mobile because they can move around while doing shit
[3:43:05] <%Ninestempest> BARD SMASHES BUTTONS
[3:43:06] <Bane3341> LUL
[3:43:06] <professorarcana> Best explanation of a bow and arrows ever
[3:43:08] <+Grayhammatter> they also sing
[3:43:08] <Binarypony> machinist is clunky
[3:43:09] <+thundiedramon> Remember Bowmage
[3:43:10] <DetroitSentai> buffs
[3:43:12] <PontiusPyrite> tanks used to have positionals in 1.x, and not just "from the front"
[3:43:13] <%frsttcs> congratulations on becoming a Dragoon, here's your stick

[3:43:23] <haveswordmuststing> i always comend a healer because theres too few out there
[3:43:23] <thetyrantcbass> I want to level MCH but oh god not until 5.0
[3:43:25] <+Dragonslaved> the only problem is when there's a big aoe, they're a little slow to run out so you have to spring out or get rescued
[3:43:26] <+mik255> theyre "support"
[3:43:29] <Angry_Ev1L> @AngriestPat show off Bahamut
[3:43:30] <Xelhesia> party buffs
[3:43:35] <%DXLelouch24> MCH has aStand
[3:43:37] <+Silentman0> machinist is going to completely change in a month so don't bother doing any research right now
[3:43:38] <%VioletHeart> Crits, supports, and moves off your main cooldown.
[3:43:40] <%VioletHeart> It's a weird class.
[3:43:41] <Madbearv> dancer will end up being a required class
[3:43:41] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> sounds cool

[3:43:49] <%OdysseyKnight> Red Mage 90% pew and 10% We goin' in!
[3:43:49] <+Vostroyan1> so what is the deal with blue mage not being a class

[3:45:09] <Helghast102> WAR is the best maintank though, PLD is the offtank
[3:45:09] <+Bad1uck> PLD has the "grab onot my buttocks children" with passage of arms
[3:45:09] <thetyrantcbass> Five fell cleaves.
[3:45:09] <aeonicvector> Hammer is just BRICK ON STICk @AngriestPat

[3:45:14] <+miguelrod777> CALL CLEVE
[3:45:18] <theobble> PLD also has the best button. Every other tank is jealous of it.
[3:45:18] <+Innocuous_Goat> Fell Cleave! Fell Cleave! Fell Cleave!
[3:45:19] <xelomaimhov> WAR is technically best tank at the moment
[3:45:19] <dickbuttwoman> You hit inner release
[3:45:20] <+jinshiroi> muh FELL CLEAAVEs!
[3:45:21] <%TheSniperJoe> Warrior is a tank that thinks it's a dps.

[3:45:32] <vVAstrAVv> show inner release
[3:45:33] <%TG_Cid11> WAR is best tank
[3:45:33] <KoyFoster> Uninstalling FF14. The login is already giving my trouble
[3:45:33] <pandangerous> SourPls
[3:45:35] <+Hobojo153> They're a tank who doesn't know what a tank is
[3:45:35] <%korth367> warrior is simplest tank
[3:45:36] <Rukabuk> INNER BEAST
[3:45:37] <haveswordmuststing> WAR is single target damage, PLD is AOE damage, DRK look cool i guess
[3:45:38] <+DrunkenDice> they sound like beserkers
[3:45:39] <%QuadraticGravity> They also have the most HP
[3:45:40] <$valriot> DO INNER RELEASE
[3:45:40] <+RinPeda> less defense lots of health
[3:45:41] <+ch0ob> warrior best dps
[3:45:42] <+bluedude152> But blu tho
[3:45:44] <+Tuxadracles> This is the PC version right?

[3:45:51] <transporterthesequel> There is a face on the back of Pat's Warrior set and now I can't unsee it
[3:45:52] <%frsttcs> holmgang is the best invulnibility
[3:45:53] <haveswordmuststing> Kappa
[3:45:53] <Grandmeridi> PLD aoe ?? Kappa
[3:45:53] <dickbuttwoman> Inner release and do BIG numbers
[3:45:55] <@SSaryn> If you like the sound of Fell Cleave, and you probably threw your head back at the sound of Fell Cleave, you'll probably like WAR.
[3:45:56] <+Dragonslaved> elmoooo
[3:45:57] <%TheSniperJoe> Paladins are all "Get behind me fellow party members." Dark Knights are like "Get out of my way fellow party members."
[3:45:57] <@mothmandraws> warriors get meme eyes
[3:45:58] <koffeemancer> Face roll as in all you to is smash your face into the keyboard and roll around and you win lol
[3:46:02] <%spiritofmojave> WAR consumed all the other DPS to gain power
[3:46:03] <theobble> face camera
[3:46:07] <Binarypony> inner release make eyes glow
[3:46:08] <Saltmeisterr> is fell cleave just big damage?
[3:46:13] <%Venhammer> @headsheldhigh I probably did at least 70 today LUL
[3:46:13] <dickbuttwoman> BIG numbers
[3:46:14] <transporterthesequel> :|

[3:46:17] <%TG_Cid11> yea
[3:46:17] <+mik255> YEA
[3:46:17] <Grandmeridi> WAR has highest aoe and single right now LUL
[3:46:18] <%Ninestempest> @Tuxadracles yes but the versions are identical
[3:46:18] <Jarvanii> warriors will even off-tank in a normal dungeon believe it or not
[3:46:18] <+BioHunter> glowy eyes is the best
[3:46:18] <dickbuttwoman> Highest DPS for 10 seconds
[3:46:19] <Neo_Kaiser> Use a limit break
[3:46:21] <%spiritofmojave> FAT NUMBERS
[3:46:21] <HeadsHeldHigh> NOOOO
[3:46:26] <Kung_Fu_KaiTV> RIP AND TEAR
[3:46:28] <ModelAmi> Direct Crit BIG DAMAGE
[3:46:29] <$Desmond_Vakarian> gauranteed crit direct hits
[3:46:30] <+Roundelay11> BIG NUMBER
[3:46:32] <+AverageBlubber> It's quite literally kill cut
[3:46:32] <+Grayhammatter> the fattest numbers
[3:46:34] <DetroitSentai> Crit, direct hit and BIG!!
[3:46:35] <Saltmeisterr> GOOD
[3:46:38] <+Tuxadracles> Okay thanks @Ninestempest I may pick both up in case I don't wanna be on PC
[3:46:39] <For_Temeria> Warriors have strong personal mitigation and make very good main tanks because of it. They don't have a lot to do as off-tanks
[3:46:41] <%AquilaHarukaze> PLD is the only tank that doesn't get a cool aura with their tank stances :c
[3:46:42] <+thundiedramon> PLD will actually feel good to level
[3:46:43] <%Nobrev> @Neo_Kaiser can't LB without a party
[3:46:45] <+mik255> forgot onslaught and upheaval
[3:46:46] <%Divryne> @AngriestPat Don't forget DRK gets Inner Release in 5.0.
[3:46:47] <+Silentman0> drk: the matt class
[3:46:47] <xelomaimhov> Yuuuuuup

[3:46:57] <%QuadraticGravity> Wrong, MCH
[3:46:57] <theobble> Not bigger than MCH
[3:46:57] <dickbuttwoman> And people are STILL not happy!
[3:46:57] <+ecolli37108> i mean mch
[3:46:58] <+Bad1uck> @KoyFoster Trying to use your password in the launcher?
[3:46:58] <+Greywyn00> STANDO

[3:46:58] <%Shadowthedigger> No that's MCH
[3:46:59] <+BioHunter> mch begs to differ
[3:46:59] <r_Foeburden87> MCH
[3:46:59] <Binarypony> machinists rework is bigger
[3:46:59] <tsuchi7> machinist tho
[3:46:59] <%TheSniperJoe> Machinist is getting the biggest rework.
[3:46:59] <+Grayhammatter> 1 month
[3:46:59] <+NeonLight> MCH
[3:47:00] <DetroitSentai> No that's mch
[3:47:00] <moogleboy1984> wrong
[3:47:00] <moosemonkey397> MCH is clearly bigger
[3:47:00] <+Pyr0_Fr0st> DRK is good for magic bosses
[3:47:01] <+thundiedramon> biggest remake next to mch
[3:47:01] <GambolMuse> Machinist says otherwise
[3:47:01] <+bluedude152> Lies, machinest xists
[3:47:02] <+Dubcrookz> machints D:
[3:47:02] <haisho> Life has many doors, edge boi.
[3:47:02] <itsamarshian> MCH
[3:47:03] <$valriot> MACHINIST IS
[3:47:04] <+miguelrod777> Mch
[3:47:05] <+Zepshire> Mch has the biggest rework
[3:47:05] <Angry_Ev1L> Crazy Talk
[3:47:07] <DaydreamDisaster> Well MCH is biggest.
[3:47:07] <AdmiralButtloaf> NO MCH is pretty much a new job
[3:47:07] <+Bipolar_Bear0> Bigger than machinist?
[3:47:08] <Lotharman> Astrologian though LUL
[3:47:08] <tsuchi7> muh chinist
[3:47:08] <+Hobojo153> @Tuxadracles Be sure to decide early then because you do have to buy expansions per platform.
[3:47:08] <%Shadowthedigger> MCH literally looks like a different class.
[3:47:09] <%Arnschen> MCH
[3:47:11] <HeadsHeldHigh> Edge abilities LUL
[3:47:11] <dickbuttwoman> Now it's "Too simple"!
[3:47:13] <%Ninestempest> @Tuxadracles if you don't wanna be on PC just get it on PS4, there's cross play (LITERALLY THE SAME GAME) and m&k work on ps4
[3:47:14] <+ClaireBearz> I meannnn ast rework feels like the biggest in the wrong direction xD
[3:47:14] <+Grayhammatter> machinist is getting the bigger rework
[3:47:15] <GundamF91> Crazy Talk
[3:47:15] <Xelhesia> machinist is tho
[3:47:17] <r_Foeburden87> Crazy Talk Removing MCH from game
[3:47:20] <%DXLelouch24> STANDO POWAH
[3:47:21] <frostycrinkle> Machinist and Scholar are getting pretty huge reworks, but DRK is probably 3rd
[3:47:23] <@SSaryn> DRK: I made this rework. MCH: You made this? I made this.
[3:47:26] <xelomaimhov> MCH is worst class over all, DRK is worst Tank.
[3:47:28] <DetroitSentai> The Darkest Knight is hella good
[3:47:29] <+mik255> class id used to be hurt yourself to hurt enemy more
[3:47:30] <%CrimsonCore90> uptime!
[3:47:39] <ArthurDoyleRPG> MCH is a different job pretty much
[3:47:43] <A_Red_Robot> I'm going to miss Abyssal Drain being a normal GCD
[3:47:46] <+thundiedramon> !uptime
[3:47:47] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 47m.
[3:47:48] <%xemnahort> Real talk drk, mch, and ast are gonna be so different
[3:47:51] <AdmiralButtloaf> Yoshi P says MCH is pretty much a new job
[3:47:53] <+ClaireBearz> gonna miss ammo on mch rooCry
[3:47:55] <vVAstrAVv> rip abyssal drain
[3:47:57] <bigstupidjellyfish1337> !uptime
[3:47:58] <+grenberr1> @AngriestPat do the racial stats of youre character actually matter for the classes? or is it more for flavor?
[3:47:58] <transporterthesequel> GIANT swords
[3:47:59] <A_Red_Robot> AST looks largely the same
[3:48:00] <Angry_Ev1L> rule of cool
[3:48:01] <+Hobojo153> You like being an edgy boi
[3:48:02] <%TheSniperJoe> Best Job Quests in the whole game.
[3:48:02] <+Innocuous_Goat> That's a good reason
[3:48:05] <%skizzuto> Pat like the big sword
[3:48:06] <+thundiedramon> @grenberr1 racial stats don't matter
[3:48:07] <%CrimsonCore90> apatGoblin thanks.
[3:48:09] <%skizzuto> just like in MH
[3:48:09] <DetroitSentai> Also worse tank doesnt mean bad, just the other two are more optimal
[3:48:11] <%xemnahort> @grenberr1 flavor
[3:48:12] <$valriot> Didnt even do Bloodspiller
[3:48:12] <%VioletHeart> AST doesn't look all that different. The cards are only half their moveset and even then it's not changing that much.
[3:48:12] <+miguelrod777> 2 main mechanic in mcg are gone
[3:48:15] <+Bad1uck> Also Frey is a badass
[3:48:18] <Binarypony> 1 combo in shadowbringers tho
[3:48:19] <%Ninestempest> they don't EXIST ANY MORE
[3:48:19] <%TG_Cid11> DRK will go from shit tier to not quite as shit tier
[3:48:21] <+SuperChumps> Hey! This isn't ESO. Pfffft.
[3:48:21] <dickbuttwoman> They're like 2 points
[3:48:22] <+cawi> I play as a lala tank
[3:48:22] <+RinPeda> Lalafel tank for life
[3:48:22] <%spiritofmojave> I love my Guts class even if he's not a great tank rn
[3:48:23] <moosemonkey397> are there racial stats?
[3:48:24] <+Hobojo153> I forgot there are racial buffs
[3:48:25] <+Kango234> I really appreciate all the info in this stream.
[3:48:27] <dickbuttwoman> And you get like 1000
[3:48:27] <%Ninestempest> THey got rid of them
[3:48:29] <thetyrantcbass> serve save slave slay.
[3:48:29] <@mothmandraws> as long as you are not doing speed runs of bosses you are fine taking any class
[3:48:29] <+Grayhammatter> pokey stick
[3:48:30] <%GarbageNirvana> Racial stats are a 1.0 holdover
[3:48:33] <HeadsHeldHigh> Time to hug to floor
[3:48:34] <Neo_Kaiser> What would Pats reaction be if Elmo was made a pet in FF14?
[3:48:36] <+mik255> JUMPY BOIS
[3:48:38] <@mothmandraws> dragoon like combo
[3:48:38] <xelomaimhov> Racial stats don't matter, this isn't early FFXI
[3:48:40] <+RaziWraith> racial stats are like 1-3 point difference. negligible
[3:48:43] <KatabolicRage> dragoon is about blood of the dragon management, and getting life of the dragon which y ou don't have yet
[3:48:44] <%xemnahort> @a_red_robot are you serious? The cards are changing dramatically
[3:48:44] <+Hobojo153> I mean, you can have a cat
[3:48:50] <theobble> Racials are more of an XI thing
[3:48:52] <Soulsbjorne> 1.0 content negligible at this point
[3:48:59] <+Grayhammatter> boo!
[3:49:05] <Monkeyweed21> MNK is a class for real men only
[3:49:05] <+Silentman0> potatoes can be good warriors, race don't mean shit
[3:49:05] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Try to pick the race that gives you more vitality, it's the difference of few thousand points of HP
[3:49:06] <%Typhaeon> No Nastrond, too bad
[3:49:07] <Saltmeisterr> theres currently 3 tanks right?
[3:49:10] <@SSaryn> There's a Dragon jump, it cool
[3:49:10] <+Innocuous_Goat> Five jumps
[3:49:12] <KatabolicRage> your missing the mirage dives and dragoneyes shit man
[3:49:13] <DetroitSentai> 1.0 doesnt exist
[3:49:14] <A_Red_Robot> @xemnahort They're all changing to basically be balance and the rest of their kit is largely the same
[3:49:17] <+thundiedramon> @angriestpat how do you like the Niddhog jump
[3:49:19] <AdmiralButtloaf> STARDIVER big jumps
[3:49:21] <vVAstrAVv> your racial differences at endgame amount to plus 1 point in a pool of 1500 points or more
[3:49:23] <+mik255> DO PVP

[3:52:04] <%TheSniperJoe> Elmo called me a bad word. :_:\
[3:52:05] <+claudesavegely> elmo don't type the n word
[3:52:06] <%yeknomlive> you guys check the manga 'samnk" it's a comedy romance about a samurai who cant get into groups
[3:52:06] <Monkeyweed21> heated kitty moment
[3:52:06] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Elmo is starting the RACE WAR??
[3:52:06] <Xelhesia> samurai's flow is arguably the best in the game
[3:52:07] <%MonsieurHedge> elmo out here shouting PECK live on stream
[3:52:07] <xelomaimhov> And effective, but not really great in Super-Endgame stuff.
[3:52:08] <Kung_Fu_KaiTV> Elmo gonna start the war.

[3:52:20] <haveswordmuststing> you mean Monk Kappa
[3:52:21] <Saltmeisterr> that samurai needs a GUN
[3:52:22] <%PanicSwytch> Elmo is allowed to be racist
[3:52:26] <$antibonehurtingjuice> Ozma flex
[3:52:26] <+ch0ob> It's becuz sam was already preparing for Shadowbringers before it was announced Kappa
[3:52:26] <Neo_Kaiser> Elmo is like those AI bots that play GTA5
[3:52:28] <ShichiNoBushi> Elmo: I hate those rats! They are responsible for all the social problems!
[3:52:28] <Kung_Fu_KaiTV> SAM is basically the Braindead DPS class.
[3:52:28] <%GarbageNirvana> Welp
[3:52:28] <+VashyronM> the other weeb job
[3:52:29] <%Fidel_Castbro> Oh yeah they're getting rid of Slashing Debuff SAM Literally as nothing to bring now
[3:52:29] <DetroitSentai> BLM lost their only utility
[3:52:31] <$Valdorick> Best 2 DPS to bring to a 4 man - SAM and BLM Kappa

[3:52:54] <Saltmeisterr> SUBOPTIMAL
[3:52:58] <theobble> I can't watch this
[3:52:58] <@mothmandraws> cherry blossom
[3:52:59] <+Hobojo153> Build weeb to deal big damage
[3:53:01] <Binarypony> samurai is doing combos to get those symbols, then spending those symbols on moves. they also get a red kenki gauge that can be used for big moves
[3:53:02] <%jiin6> SHAMFUL DISPRAY pat
[3:53:05] <%MonsieurHedge> SCHUM
[3:53:07] <+thundiedramon> there ya to

[3:53:18] <+thundiedramon> Pat pls
[3:53:21] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@Ninestempest) (warning)
[3:53:23] <%ArcanumMBD> @AngriestPat can you judgement cut?
[3:53:25] <Dastardry> wooden beam censored the Midare
[3:53:26] <%Reizie_Etherealm> He didn't do the opener correctly lol
[3:53:27] <%Shadowthedigger> Covered the cool move with a fucking stick,
[3:53:27] <Saltmeisterr> WTF
[3:53:29] <@mothmandraws> tree block
[3:53:29] <expressnode> Did a black line just show up?
[3:53:30] <ModelAmi> hagakure is getting removed, F
[3:53:30] <%Kirby_Sauce> Yeah, so MHW longsword
[3:53:32] <xelomaimhov> SAM is great unless you want to do all of the SAVAGE and HARD MODE stuff
[3:53:33] <%MonsieurHedge> pat confirmed as not worthy as his opponent
[3:53:33] <@mothmandraws> gaijin not allowed to watch
[3:53:36] <kirin53> Whats a dps that people actually want to take to do content? Im debating between leveling DRG or SMN but cant decide
[3:53:36] <rekinom> BIG NUBMER
[3:53:38] <%Ninestempest> 41k dang
[3:53:39] <+mik255> does pat have any ravana weapons?
[3:53:39] <+Grayhammatter> iaijutsu
[3:53:41] <ModelAmi> 41K WOO
[3:53:43] <EVOriginal> @AngriestPat When do you use Devil Trigger on this class?
[3:53:44] <For_Temeria> It's important to remember that if you fail to do big damage as a samurai, you're gonna be useless
[3:53:44] <%TheShal> wa
[3:53:45] <%yeknomlive> notice that was 41k vs is other attacks
[3:53:46] <Helghast102> you only Midare when you don't have hagakure
[3:53:47] <Binarypony> people wanna take everything,
[3:53:57] <HeadsHeldHigh> SAM players MUST carry around flower petals to throw around
[3:53:59] <HibikiYamada> @kirin53 Dragoon, Bard and Ninja are pretty popular
[3:54:00] <$valriot> Hagakure is so boring
[3:54:00] <Binarypony> dont take a class over whether they will be let into content
[3:54:03] <Binarypony> be a good player
[3:54:10] <Binarypony> being good is what gets you slots
[3:54:11] <%Ninestempest> 60 second dot??
[3:54:14] <+SDT_Mercury> SAM is trash
[3:54:17] <+ZenVulgarity> Sorry, I may have missed it. What is a nice class to start as if I am mechanically kind of garbage? Anyone here have suggestions? I'm definitely looking to start playing when the new expansion hits.
[3:54:18] <+thundiedramon> yeah, the dot is a minute
[3:54:19] <Angry_Ev1L> @kirin53 SMN will be meta in 5.0 cause of 5% aoe damage buff and res
[3:54:19] <pandangerous> no one knows if you're a good player when you just join a party lmao they just kick you
[3:54:20] <rekinom> Wow your Roe actually looks good @AngriestPat
[3:54:24] <ItIsSky> god, SAM does a ton of damage
[3:54:25] <@SSaryn> @Ninestempest It's very good.
[3:54:28] <Binarypony> literally every class in this game is viable, this isnt wow
[3:54:30] <+Ryallen> But the biggest disappointment is that they can't nothing personnel kid people
[3:54:30] <horsesaredumb> dot?
[3:54:31] <%Ninestempest> Im used to bard life :(
[3:54:32] <Kung_Fu_KaiTV> My SAM glam is Vergil @AngriestPat
[3:54:32] <RavenHellkite> i like my animy
[3:54:34] <$valriot> Armourer Rotation PogChamp
[3:54:36] <Monkeyweed21> they're babies first melee class
[3:54:40] <xelomaimhov> Most people don't care about the super-hard modes, so it doesn't matter to the majority of players.
[3:54:43] <@mothmandraws> id imagine mages are easier on mechanics
[3:54:43] <+The_UnfathoMarble> dmg over time
[3:54:45] <%Kirby_Sauce> Call it a "doot"
[3:54:46] <theobble> The mobility of sam is what makes me love them. Short CD off global EJ and gap closer.
[3:54:46] <+Dessbocito2> what binary said, no amount of "meta" will carry you being bad at what youre playing. Go for what you like and master it first, then think about class meta
[3:54:46] <@mothmandraws> as you dont move as much
[3:54:47] <%NWR_James> play some music!
[3:54:47] <Binarypony> machinist doesnt work
[3:54:48] <SeventyForce> Damage Over Time ie; poison
[3:54:50] <+Cardz_> Doot for my amusement
[3:54:51] <Lotharman> @ZenVulgarity Lancer is easy to start.
[3:54:52] <horsesaredumb> @The_UnfathoMarble thnx
[3:54:53] <%xemnahort> @zenvulgarity what role dps, healer, or tank
[3:54:54] <AdmiralButtloaf> shadow priest
[3:54:55] <Angry_Ev1L> Working very hard on the looks only to look like a WoW refugee Kappa
[3:54:56] <@lewdskeletor13> Y’all are nerds
[3:54:57] <@SSaryn> MCH is something you shouldn't even show anyway. It's gonna so different that it doens't matter.
[3:54:57] <KatabolicRage> mch doesn't work, bard is about maintaininng dots and songs
[3:54:58] <+ch0ob> MCH is for masochists
[3:54:59] <%yeknomlive> if you wanna know mch endgame hoo boy that'll take a sec
[3:54:59] <kirin53> SMN looks neat but I'm kinda hesitant to level them now with the changed coming in 5.0
[3:55:00] <xelomaimhov> Bard is great. Trust me, I'm a Bard.
[3:55:01] <%EvilSoully> Machinist gets a robot jojo stand next expansion
[3:55:01] <%spiritofmojave> just play copyright tunes as BRD
[3:55:02] <Kung_Fu_KaiTV> I just notcied, Pat has no MONK. DansGame
[3:55:03] <Binarypony> SMN is a fun cluster fuck
[3:55:04] <+ch0ob> BRD is great tho
[3:55:05] <%TheSniperJoe> Machinist doesn't matter because it's becoming an entirely different class in Shadowbringers were it will get a big robot with a pilebunker.
[3:55:08] <Kain5707> show PLD
[3:55:10] <Binarypony> like they have so much shit to juggle
[3:55:12] <$valriot> BIG UNIT
[3:55:13] <+ZenVulgarity> I dunno. I haven't actually played an MMO in forever. I remember healing in WoW being very boring.
[3:55:13] <%Ninestempest> @AngriestPat Bard puts dots on people, increases it's crit chance, and when dots crit, it gets special effects based on the song the bard is currently playing
[3:55:14] <%QuadraticGravity> @Kain5707 he did
[3:55:17] <Guardiansaiyan> ...
[3:55:19] <+RaziWraith> Summoners are gettting to summon what now??? monkaS
[3:55:20] <%spiritofmojave> @kung_fu_kaitv My main MNK is crying at the fact
[3:55:21] <Guardiansaiyan> ....
[3:55:21] <+Greywyn00> SMn is very timing focused
[3:55:21] <+ZenVulgarity> Mage seems fun.
[3:55:24] <Kain5707> oh i must have not been watching LUL
[3:55:25] <%mastertwin2> Hold up, you're just allowed to change class whenever?
[3:55:27] <%Ninestempest> I DO BUT IM NOT HERE
[3:55:28] <ModelAmi> yes
[3:55:32] <Monkeyweed21> coward ass
[3:55:33] <+thundiedramon> @mastertwin2 yes

[3:55:42] <@mothmandraws> remember turn on your ability to view effects
[3:55:42] <OrphixPride> if you were on crystal i could show FeelsBadMan
[3:55:43] <+thundiedramon> Time to wait 2 minutes for Bahamut
[3:55:43] <+EatinEden> Monk?
[3:55:44] <+Grayhammatter> two minute rotation, but sweet deeps
[3:55:45] <%mastertwin2> jesus that's sick
[3:55:45] <haveswordmuststing> aspiring MCH need to wait for the expansion since it'll be entirely different
[3:55:46] <+mik255> just SMN things
[3:55:46] <thetyrantcbass> Not in the middle of a fight or duty
[3:55:48] <+Dessbocito2> effects off @AngriestPat
[3:55:48] <AdmiralButtloaf> show effects!
[3:55:49] <+Ryallen> That's the biggest difference between WoW and FFXIV on the surface, you don't need to change characters
[3:55:50] <Xelhesia> bard is amazing. the flow of the song rotation and the procs feel really good
[3:55:50] <%Ninestempest> @OrphixPride same :(
[3:55:51] <xelomaimhov> Not in fights or dungeons
[3:55:51] <Covil91> Let's watch someone take 2 minutes to build to Bahamut!
[3:55:53] <HeadsHeldHigh> The cutscene guy can change in the middle of fights
[3:55:53] <%frsttcs> put effects back on
[3:55:55] <vVAstrAVv> have vel show blm too
[3:55:56] <%xemnahort> @mastertwin2 out of combat yes but you need to keep the gear with you
[3:55:59] <Kurochiooo> Go 1st person pat!
[3:56:00] <%CrimsonCore90> yeah you gotta level them up though separately
[3:56:01] <+BioHunter> thats the final eureka weapon
[3:56:01] <%Kirby_Sauce> Nerd class
[3:56:03] <2DSuperiority> I'd wait till the changes to play SMN
[3:56:04] <%TheSniperJoe> Summoner is basically Warlock.
[3:56:05] <%Kirby_Sauce> I love it
[3:56:09] <+midnightq2> is there any reason to play more than one character?
[3:56:09] <TerryTheTurret> @mastertwin2 Yup, one character can level every job.
[3:56:11] <Kung_Fu_KaiTV> The Pokemon class.
[3:56:12] <%TheSniperJoe> Big Dots into BIG summons.
[3:56:16] <Psykoknight65> did he already show off dark Knight?
[3:56:23] <+AmaniIsYourBoss> Pat, stop stalling and do UWU you coward babby. LUL
[3:56:23] <%spiritofmojave> I only regret Bahamut not being even biggerer
[3:56:25] <Angry_Ev1L> ANd you can move for most of that
[3:56:25] <+Grayhammatter> big dots for big bois
[3:56:26] <professorarcana> SMN Gang represent

[3:56:32] <%Ninestempest> they didn't do ahk morn
[3:56:32] <+Silentman0> summoner can use glamour on their pets to make them look like pokemon

[3:58:17] <Angry_Ev1L> RDM is for noobs
[3:58:17] <$OmegaWeltall> THis is why i like Woolie more
[3:58:17] <+AmaniIsYourBoss> Pat talkin' shit bout the blacks AGAIN. Kappa
[3:58:18] <+Ryallen> RDM is super simple
[3:58:18] <@SSaryn> But no actually show BLM tho
[3:58:19] <+thundiedramon> why you gotta have a heated gamer moment
[3:58:19] <+RinPeda> red mage for life
[3:58:20] <%TheSniperJoe> Pat's Black Mage hate is unreasonable and silly, just like him. They're super strong and have a fun balancing act with their spells.
[3:58:20] <Covil91> Give me the option for a bigger bahamut!
[3:58:21] <Helghast102> this classism
[3:58:22] <CuriousReborn> Blue mages are the best
[3:58:22] <%Leodude> @AngriestPat BUT KONOSUBA!!!
[3:58:22] <@SSaryn> Dualcast
[3:58:25] <moogleboy1984> Pat is afraid of BIG NUMBER
[3:58:26] <+VashyronM> Pat is just bitter that he can do as big numbers as Black Mage
[3:58:31] <+AmaniIsYourBoss> YEAH RED MAGE Kreygasm
[3:58:31] <%Kyma1020> 40k fouls is pretty good
[3:58:35] <$valriot> Sounds like Classism Pat being mad at one player you dont like @angriestpat Kappa Kappa
[3:58:36] <Binarypony> Black mage is a turret class, that rotates between high damage that uses a lot of mana, and a mana regen phase
[3:58:36] <+Ryallen> But not too uneven
[3:58:37] <theobble> ?????
[3:58:41] <EVOriginal> What you got against BLM atpCarl
[3:58:44] <%Ninestempest> NO MANAFICATION
[3:58:45] <%Kyma1020> Big numbers big damage
[3:58:46] <rekinom> ????
[3:58:46] <Binarypony> red mage is babys first mage
[3:58:46] <%korth367> @AngriestPat red mage lb3 blocks the entire floor, black mage dont do that shit
[3:58:47] <%Ninestempest> PAT NO
[3:58:47] <Binarypony> for pat
[3:58:48] <+Silentman0> crazy talk, you want them very even
[3:58:48] <%tyler274> no pat
[3:58:49] <+RushUnplugged> black mage is literally caster Sam so pat is big wrong
[3:58:51] <+Ryallen> If there's a difference above 30 for RDM, then their mana gain slows down and their DPS suffers
[3:58:53] <haveswordmuststing> @thesniperjoe Pat likes numbers, but BLM and Disgaea are too big number for pat brain
[3:58:53] <moosemonkey397> 1
[3:58:55] <+Grayhammatter> 90
[3:58:55] <+thundiedramon> no Manafication rip
[3:58:57] <%spiritofmojave> BIG UNEVEN BOIS
[3:58:58] <%Ninestempest> NO you want it to be the most uneven possibl eactually

[3:59:19] <haveswordmuststing> @bane3341 the VOD and the video on his channel
[3:59:22] <+thundiedramon> you want your Black and White Mana at around 80 but slightly uneven
[3:59:22] <%Ninestempest> Woolie would play sam or monk
[3:59:26] <%korth367> smol numbers
[3:59:27] <Monkeyweed21> show BLM you bitch
[3:59:28] <Binarypony> red mage is simple and easy, also can heal and raise

[3:59:36] <+Dessbocito2> show BLM 😡
[3:59:36] <%TheSniperJoe> Woolie would play Ninja because it's the closest to a fighting game.
[3:59:37] <%Typhaeon> Green Flare or Green Holy Kappa
[3:59:39] <Binarypony> red mage is loved because they can save scuffed runs
[3:59:40] <$OmegaWeltall> yea Woolie would play Monk
[3:59:40] <Dastardry> epic melee combo that does about as much damage as 1 BLM fire iv crit
[3:59:40] <+SDT_Mercury> Monk showcase??
[3:59:43] <zamzoph> Blowout Kreygasm
[3:59:43] <%Reizie_Etherealm> RDM can go one step beyond for more damage by doing what's called a double combo
[3:59:44] <+AmaniIsYourBoss> We're also getting cooler AOE spells
[3:59:45] <+thundiedramon> I see Woolie playing NIN or MNK
[3:59:45] <Saltmeisterr> woolie would play baba is you
[3:59:45] <%TheSniperJoe> Big combos.

[4:02:07] <+thundiedramon> @twerknadooo you can set up the glamor dresser and apply different plates per job
[4:02:10] <Psykoknight65> @angriestpat is crafting the best way to get money?
[4:02:11] <$SleepyMaribo> @AngriestPat why does every Blue mage i see suddenly decide to cast self destruct in the middle of town?
[4:02:13] <Binarypony> crafting is hell
[4:02:19] <Binarypony> but it make a lotta money

[4:02:30] <+cawi> gathering
[4:02:30] <%Typhaeon> Real men do it manually
[4:02:30] <xelomaimhov> Gathering makes money
[4:02:30] <moogleboy1984> Gathering
[4:02:31] <haisho> gotta spend money to get money
[4:02:31] <%ArcanumMBD> LIES
[4:02:32] <MultipleJiggs> Treasure maps can give decent money
[4:02:33] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> @AngriestPat is it required
[4:02:34] <ShichiNoBushi> Spend money to make money.
[4:02:34] <Angry_Ev1L> I get money by selling shit my retainers bring me
[4:02:35] <Covil91> Desynth is money
[4:02:35] <@SSaryn> Tell that to Strident
[4:02:36] <sidstyler> what the fuck
[4:02:36] <%ArcanumMBD> Sell drops for money
[4:02:37] <@CreepyPorpoise> Crafting might be one of the WORST ways to make money
[4:02:38] <Binarypony> gathering and treasure maps
[4:02:38] <%jiin6> a sink of LIES
[4:02:38] <+SevenDeadlyCyns> that's wrong
[4:02:38] <moogleboy1984> PAt has never been so wrong
[4:02:38] <TerryTheTurret> Gathering tho
[4:02:38] <%Arnschen> Definitely not
[4:02:39] <Kurochiooo> "ONLY WAY"
[4:02:40] <%TheShal> ?? You can just sell Materia and primal drops
[4:02:41] <@CreepyPorpoise> unless you're the tip top

[4:03:14] <Twerknadooo> Keep in mind, if you want to be a totally self-sufficient crafter who makes optimal 100% benefits you need to be all of the crafting classes at once.

[4:03:45] <$OmegaWeltall> FUN!!! riveting gameplay !! PogChamp
[4:03:46] <@JustinianKnight> collectable mining is more complicated

[4:04:18] <Bane3341> farming*

[4:11:37] <+Naniko> 200 iq
[4:11:37] <theobble> using your catch as bait
[4:11:38] <%TheSniperJoe> Literally catch big fish, use big fish as bait for EVEN BIGGER FISH.
[4:11:41] <%MonsieurHedge> isnt that warframe fishing
[4:11:44] <%Nobrev> a 4 pound anchovy must be huge
[4:11:46] <%MonsieurHedge> god i hate cetus fishing
[4:11:47] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@DoctorDerp388) (warning)
[4:11:47] <+Silentman0> @Psykoknight65 welcome to fantasy capitalism hell
[4:11:52] <%jiin6> apatGib gib to Elmo
[4:11:53] <PontiusPyrite> vibration will work if you run the thing that makes your computer think the ds4 is a xbox controller
[4:11:55] <%PanicSwytch> Does it auto catch or do u have to press inputs to reel and catch?
[4:11:56] <RavenHellkite> it works on ps4
[4:11:56] <%korth367> is it off on steam
[4:11:58] <ameraaaaaa> I'm back
[4:11:59] <$Vilecrow> FUCK YEAH FF14 steam!!!!
[4:12:01] <+Nymphonomicon> Smug Patkid.
[4:12:01] <PontiusPyrite> or just use the xbox controller
[4:12:03] <+gutlesscoward> when do you catch the fish of fun
[4:12:03] <RavenHellkite> ps4 is a better system for fishing
[4:12:06] <+MeatBomb> I've never got rumble to work on PC.
[4:12:07] <+NgaveD> How is targeting on controller?
[4:12:08] <ameraaaaaa> hey pat can i ask a question
[4:12:09] <AdmiralButtloaf> is vitbration on is steam
[4:12:15] <@mothmandraws> ultra instinct fishing
[4:12:16] <$Vilecrow> i'm late af
[4:12:17] <+Innocuous_Goat> Supah fish!
[4:12:19] <Kurochiooo> You need to hit input to catch
[4:12:19] <yosukecchi> yeah ds4 windows allows rumble
[4:12:20] <KVD22> what's that elmo monster
[4:12:22] <moogleboy1984> You have to use DS4Windows to get the vibration to work on a PS4 pad
[4:12:24] <+cawi> you can also break fish down into materials that crafters want.
[4:12:30] <%TheSniperJoe> The best part of fishing is the ability to get unique fish to put in the fishtank in your house.
[4:12:32] <theobble> you did it
[4:12:32] <%spiritofmojave> SUPREME FISH
[4:12:33] <IFlaske> there's legendary fish too, that you can only catch under certain weather conditions and at certain times
[4:12:33] <+Naniko> shrimp aren't fish 😡
[4:12:33] <Wigglebottom_> ds4windows + vibration is easy fishing Kreygasm
[4:12:36] <%TheSniperJoe> I've go ta BIIIIG shark, it's the best.
[4:12:38] <ItIsSky> 8 inch shrimp?
[4:12:39] <+RoByte2> Wow, I would have died leveling fishing without the vibration letting me know to hit the button
[4:12:49] <PontiusPyrite> probab
[4:12:50] <%Divryne> No you don't.
[4:12:52] <%MegboyManuel> aite going back to bed, fuck 8am
[4:12:55] <RavenHellkite> it's pretty bad
[4:12:59] <%Divryne> You can play with PS4 by itself.
[4:13:03] <moogleboy1984> it's a "feature" they fucked up with an update to the PS4 controller function
[4:13:05] <+Nymphonomicon> @AngriestPat I never did the fishing job, do you need to find designated fishing spots or just face any water source?
[4:13:05] <%Divryne> DS4 Controller I mean.
[4:13:06] <+aslfrasle> Show us your fishing log coward!
[4:13:08] <+SevenDeadlyCyns> it also makes a noise
[4:13:10] <KVD22> look at this tip
[4:13:10] <Helghast102> with vibration you don't have to watch the game
[4:13:11] <Binarypony> >looking at the screen while fishing
[4:13:11] <%frsttcs> Just shake your hands pretend vibration is on
[4:13:12] <+Innocuous_Goat> For when you're watching Star Trek
[4:13:13] <RavenHellkite> but if you are watching whatever you can just not pay attention
[4:13:14] <%Arnschen> While you're alt tabbed out
[4:13:15] <moogleboy1984> so you can not watch the screen and fish
[4:13:17] <@mothmandraws> now tier list the races
[4:13:18] <+aslfrasle> I want to see if it's empty!
[4:13:21] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> nani
[4:13:28] <+Nymphonomicon> Naoto!
[4:13:28] <Kung_Fu_KaiTV> Uh oh @mothmandraws
[4:13:29] <haveswordmuststing> theres also a button to toggle a glowing thing on the tip of the fishing pole
[4:13:37] <count_bob> @AngriestPat What's the deal with housing in this game? Last I heard, land was limited, and only so many people per server could buy a house?
[4:13:42] <Wigglebottom_> second... monitor... ?
[4:13:48] <DevinMayCry> Time to play Mahjong Pat.
[4:13:49] <%Typhaeon> You can configure the game to play sound when out of focus
[4:13:50] <Shinjiro120> @AngriestPat kinda stupid question, but does DoH/DoL have armory bonus?
[4:13:50] <Wigglebottom_> FeelsBadMan
[4:13:57] <%Reizie_Etherealm> 2 monitor advantages
[4:13:57] <+Silentman0> @count_bob yeah, but if people are logged out for too long, like a couple of months, they get evicted
[4:14:00] <+Nymphonomicon> I'm guessing there aren't any towns called Satonaka...
[4:14:03] <DaydreamDisaster> @AngriestPat vibration makes it super simple to tell between light, heavy, legendary tugs. when fishing for certain fishies it is great. especially for legendary.
[4:14:04] <+SkitsofRandom> what's a good noobie class
[4:14:05] <%yeknomlive> guild hest
[4:14:07] <Helghast102> teach us how to mahjong pat
[4:14:07] <%TheSniperJoe> Mahjong littler takes hours.
[4:14:08] <@mothmandraws> explain the entire story
[4:14:09] <DevinMayCry> Just a little pinfu
[4:14:09] <ameraaaaaa> pat I'm just gonna ask I'm thinking of playing a paladin warrior white mage astrolgeon scholar and samurai which one should i play
[4:14:09] <theobble> what about pachinko
[4:14:10] <moogleboy1984> Mahjong makes no sense
[4:14:10] <dickbuttwoman> Triple triad?
[4:14:12] <2DSuperiority> just get a vibration keyboard SeemsGood
[4:14:13] <Mr_Strut> Do pocket circuit
[4:14:14] <+MeatBomb> What're good classes to fuck up with and not hurt the party too much?
[4:14:15] <smallboops> PLAY MAHJONG YOU COWARD
[4:14:16] <%jiin6> Play it you Coward
[4:14:20] <+TheWhiteTrey> Would you be willing to run a dungeon so we could see your Dark Knight rotation in action?
[4:14:21] <DevinMayCry> Mahjong is easy guys. Just 3 melds and a pair.
[4:14:23] <Kurochiooo> Alright now back to showing us BLM
[4:14:25] <DevinMayCry> Except all those times its not
[4:14:27] <%Divryne> @AngriestPat TBH you need a high IQ to play Mahjong.
[4:14:29] <%frsttcs> palace of the deeeead
[4:14:32] <+Sonbunns> kokushi musou OR RIOT
[4:14:32] <ArthurDoyleRPG> You need three Strobe of Agony to feel vibrations LUL
[4:14:41] <HibikiYamada> ???
[4:14:44] <DevinMayCry> Just go for 7 pairs every time. Its foolproof
[4:14:44] <%PanicSwytch> @angriestpat Do you recommend if i create a character now or wait for update?
[4:14:47] <%Ninestempest> @AngriestPat this stacks with preferred worlds lol
[4:14:47] <moogleboy1984> I was hoping the game would teach me, but instead it was like "first you juuhachigo, then they Shakshouka, and then you Bankai and win."
[4:14:52] <%Ninestempest> so it's hilarious exp
[4:14:55] <OrphixPride> its not even at 50/60/70 its just leveling anything under the level of whatever your highest is isnt it?
[4:14:56] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Show us how you organize your armory chest?
[4:14:58] <ArthurDoyleRPG> *Stone of Agony
[4:14:59] <+gutlesscoward> so you pay $15/mo to catch fish and avoid playing mahjong?
[4:15:01] <%OdysseyKnight> Make it now
[4:15:03] <Shinjiro120> ty @AngriestPat !
[4:15:04] <Nina96> is the ps4 version up to date?@AngriestPat
[4:15:05] <%AmaniIsYourBoss> AmaniIsYourBoss subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months, currently on a 3 month streak! Pat, tell Orborne Monastery to drop this fucking Holy Knight armor my axe boy NEEDS to be fancy Paaaaaaaaat!
[4:15:11] <%OdysseyKnight> They are incentivizing doing low level content right now
[4:15:12] <+Sir_gonthorian> what professions would you recommend for new lvl 70 player for gill
[4:15:12] <Firaga64> Will this be on Youtube later?
[4:15:17] <@mothmandraws> mahjong always has the issue where they assume you are japanese and know the rules, its like chess, everyone knows chess
[4:15:20] <xeros720> if you're interested now, i'd say pick a class that they said won't change much and play through the plot
[4:15:24] <+max_byer> does the game actually teach mahjong?
[4:15:27] <+cawi> you can create a character in the benchmark, and then transfer its look over in the main game.
[4:15:27] <%QuadraticGravity> it's also cross-play
[4:15:28] <%ArcanumMBD> Cross playy
[4:15:28] <A_Red_Robot> @AngriestPat Thoughts on the DRK changes in 5.0?
[4:15:31] <InkyDraconian> is this stream titty still goin >:?
[4:15:32] <xeros720> it takes a long time and a bunch of features are hidden behind the plot quests
[4:15:40] <%Divryne> LUL
[4:15:42] <DevinMayCry> You just have to play Mahjong and look at the hands. It eventually makes sense
[4:15:45] <@mothmandraws> I managed to get rough idea on mahjong but its the scoring system that throws me
[4:15:48] <%Arnschen> YUUUUP
[4:15:52] <%yeknomlive> aurum vale HYPE
[4:15:52] <r_Foeburden87> Thats the place
[4:15:52] <haveswordmuststing> its best if you have an aunt or grandma who can teach you mohjong instead of the game
[4:15:52] <+cawi> aurum vale sucks.
[4:15:54] <suikudo> The worst dungeon in the whole game
[4:15:55] <2DSuperiority> PS4 can use Keyboard and Mouse as well
[4:15:55] <%OdysseyKnight> Describe Aurum Vale for us Pat
[4:15:56] <%blastazoid26> apatBig OOF
[4:15:58] <Helghast102> Aurum Vale is an amazing dungeon
[4:16:01] <+Silentman0> @max_byer yes but it's full of bullshit words that don't mean garbage if you're not japanese
[4:16:01] <+metalsiren31> pvpLUL
[4:16:03] <%TombstoneTTromboners> piss dungeon
[4:16:04] <Kung_Fu_KaiTV> FUCK THE VALE
[4:16:04] <%Arnschen> The range of Flash
[4:16:07] <Psyramics> @AngriestPat I have a trial account on steam, should I buy it there or on the SE store
[4:16:07] <Kain5707> show AV pat
[4:16:08] <+Nymphonomicon> If I had some more sub time, I'd be all over Dark Knight...
[4:16:08] <ameraaaaaa> hey pat I'm thinking of playing samurai astrolgeon scholar white mage warrior or paladin which one should i play
[4:16:10] <ArthurDoyleRPG> AV NotLikeThis
[4:16:12] <theobble> Fun fact: aurum vale is optional.
[4:16:12] <+Revets315> @AngriestPat does the recommended gear button actually work?
[4:16:15] <%yeknomlive> first room is a fucking experience
[4:16:16] <+DrunkenDice> so basically suck it up LUL
[4:16:19] <Xelhesia> oh god oh no OH GOD THE AV FLASHBACKS
[4:16:19] <%TheSniperJoe> How big is Batista's dick?
[4:16:20] <%spiritofmojave> Aurum Vale is torterous to start/vet people
[4:16:21] <+Sir_gonthorian> what professions would you recommend for new lvl 70 player
[4:16:22] <KVD22> is this the end of the stream
[4:16:22] <Kghaleon> How do I use my beast gauge?

[4:16:25] <Ravoric> @AngriestPat When is Fishing stream?
[4:16:28] <+Bipolar_Bear0> How come you dont like black mage?
[4:16:29] <ItsKitKat_> i literally abandon that run every time
[4:16:29] <RavenHellkite> AV isn't optional if you want to rank up the GC
[4:16:30] <$hatesdps> why is pee stored in the balls?
[4:16:35] <%QuadraticGravity> @AngriestPat thank you for providing background for leveling fishing. Just hit 67.
[4:16:38] <TerryTheTurret> @PanicSwytch Just keep in mind there's a lot of story-locked stuff, so if you start now you might be able to catch up by the time of the update.
[4:16:38] <Kyderz3> well rip flash soon
[4:16:38] <@mothmandraws> the official store has heavensward for free, not sure if steam does
[4:16:39] <+Revets315> thanks!
[4:16:40] <+SevenDeadlyCyns> Do you like the story?
[4:16:40] <Jack_Nightshadow> BTW Flash is going away in ShB
[4:16:40] <count_bob> Housing? How does it work?
[4:16:42] <%blastazoid26> @angriestpat Whats the best way to level your crafts?
[4:16:46] <%frsttcs> why aren't you playing a cat girl?
[4:16:52] <xeros720> i hate that armory chest rule
[4:16:56] <MasterCosmic> dont know what i like best. MK or controller :(
[4:16:59] <%Nobrev> buy it on the SE store because if you buy it on steam you can only buy the rest of the stuff on steam and can't take advantage of SE deals
[4:17:01] <+DoctorDerp388> @AngriestPat what's your favorite fight in the game
[4:17:01] <Helghast102> @Sir_gonthorian ALL of them, you can't get by only using 1
[4:17:05] <%CrimsonCore90> Why aren't you a potato?
[4:17:05] <%PanicSwytch> @terrytheturret Thanks
[4:17:09] <+Nymphonomicon> @frsttcs Because a balding ginger catgirl would just look riddickulous.
[4:17:11] <+Vanic_Venator> Pat or whomever: if I was in on the base game before the expansions and wanted to get back in, what's the best way to pick up everything I've forgotten?
[4:17:11] <%TheSniperJoe> Yeah, abuse beast tribe quests and leves.
[4:17:14] <gypsystranger> are the PC and ps4 servers separate? meaning can you cross platform play?

[4:17:39] <RavenHellkite> who's your fav character from the story ?
[4:17:43] <%Typhaeon> Turn in HQ items for leves & GC turn-ins for double XP
[4:17:43] <%Faustgesicht> Class-wise
[4:17:43] <+Deebo305> recommended gear button slightly works, ring, earring and bracelets tend to never work properly with recommended
[4:17:43] <@mothmandraws> because people like to role play as something they are not, hence pat hates lalas
[4:17:46] <+Amaterasu_Nyan> Why is everyone jelly over BLM DPS?
