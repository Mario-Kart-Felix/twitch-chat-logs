[0:47:43] <%Cozy90> @AFlyingTaco1 i know sorry i was messing around.
[0:47:47] <Onatamana> Hey, don't diss the turret. I'm sure it fills a valuable missing niche
[0:47:54] <$ringabal> The turret is actually Pat's semi ultimate form
[0:47:57] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Man im bummed Mick didnt respect his deadlines
[0:47:59] <%SirKeigan> You learn to hate the turret quickly, nice
[0:48:01] <AvoidingTheCoronaVirus> this whole dlc is just ID annoying the fans
[0:48:06] <%AzureGale> Can you play as turret in battlemode
[0:48:07] <+Calek> it's a minor annoyance at best
[0:48:09] <%SirKeigan> It fucks with the pacing
[0:48:11] <%R3Roundabout> snapshotking, you thought that described your shooting ability?
[0:48:16] <peachy996> It's just 2 Scope Shots
[0:48:18] <+Regigangster> Yeah doesn't seem fun at all

[0:49:30] <%Anime_Flux> yup, he's a madlad
[0:49:33] <geassguy360> turrets also drop ammo
[0:49:37] <%dekkitout> So what's the approach to an archvile when one used their hell-powered-laser-sword to kill the 6th strongest guy in hell?
[0:49:44] <1matheuw> QUAD

[0:50:20] <geassguy360> music is great
[0:50:21] <%BoxNavy> the music is just kinda there, yeah
[0:50:24] <yourliteraldog> Turret looks fine I want written apology for Marauder and the person who thought it didn't stop the flow of combat to be publicly flogged
[0:50:30] <%SirKeigan> Can the people complaining about "no keyboard and mouse" please just shut the fuck up or go away
[0:50:33] <%dekkitout> @UnwoundCaesar70 Till it dies?
[0:50:35] <$RealThiele> SNEK

[0:50:47] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> RIP and TEAR
[0:50:48] <Cici_TheMoonRabbit> Music hasn't kicked in yet. This room isn't finished.
[0:50:48] <cephas97> love the music
[0:50:51] <peachy996> So far the Music is on par with the combat music in the Doom Hunter Base
[0:50:52] <%BoxNavy> pats doing fine on controller so it really doesnt matter lol
[0:50:56] <+UnwoundCaesar70> @dekkitout Yes
[0:50:59] <1matheuw> snek girls sliding into your dms real smooth like:
[0:50:59] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Stfu Marauder is AWESOME
[0:50:59] <%SirKeigan> ROUND 3
[0:51:00] <geassguy360> @yourliteraldog lol marauder is a chump get gud
[0:51:04] <+MayorRev> This Hulshult?
[0:51:07] <GeneralHysterics> If you've got frags you can stop archeviles from shooting fire at you long enough to shoot back.
[0:51:07] <jbrowning134> that was so close
[0:51:12] <mdkcde> The music is by the Dusk guy isn't it?
[0:51:13] <%SirKeigan> That's the fisrt time you used grenades
[0:51:13] <%BallerSwagBro9k> yes
[0:51:13] <chaosbringer28> its only more intense from here
[0:51:15] <+Regigangster> Its Doom

[0:51:18] <%donkymagooterson> heard this DLC was hard as shit
[0:51:19] <Saltmeisterr> ye mayorrev

[0:51:20] <$RealThiele> stay frosty
[0:51:21] <valriot> LUL yeah
[0:51:21] <trfurkanrey18> marauder really is easy and also it diversifies the game
[0:51:26] <%Mr_November> I super dig this track
[0:51:36] <+Calek> I remember when the music actually kicked in in this room I was like "What just showed up"
[0:51:38] <geassguy360> Archvile shortcut: Icebomb + 2x Lock on burst
[0:51:41] <%SirKeigan> That explosion hurts you
[0:51:44] <%AFlyingTaco1> I mean it's DLC. They probably expect you to have played a good bit of the game before this, so this would be par for the course.
[0:51:47] <1matheuw> hulshut is fucking everywhere good for him to finally make it into the AAA scene
[0:51:48] <%realm_forge> You’ve only been playing for 5 min
[0:51:49] <Onatamana> Yeah, Woolie is DEFINITELY gonna need to practice off screen before he streams the dlc
[0:51:56] <yourliteraldog> I forget hardcore gamers don't have fun while playing

[0:56:25] <%SirKeigan> What is that?
[0:56:31] <Onatamana> If Cacos didn't have the grenade weakness they'd still be a late game enemy
[0:56:33] <BliVru> Hey chat are the Glory kills faster now?

[0:57:19] <+TheBitingIrish> @winniethecoof A good amount of power, probably
[0:57:21] <CappuccinoGuil> This definitely seems like a "play this right after the main campaign" DLC LUL
[0:57:25] <%SirKeigan> You grab the keycard and then it's electrified. Defense system?
[0:57:27] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @winniethecoof i recommend the BFG 10000

[1:17:20] <Onatamana> staying in melee range of a cacodemon really is like sticking your face in a blender, huh?
[1:17:21] <$Order_of_Mystery> has Pat seen the familiar enemy from DOOM 2016 yet?
[1:17:23] <%toolofparanoia> The blade is in the Icon of Sin's head
[1:17:23] <Maids4lyfe> the sword is in the Icon of Sin

[1:20:11] <%DensityD> paige is so broken
[1:20:24] <Moondoggie25> @Jrocy247 basically if you were playing the base game and though, "man, this combo of enemies would be really hard to fight, glad they didnt do that" those fights are probably in this dlc
[1:20:24] <geassguy360> they saw the horde mode mod and were like "we can top that"
[1:20:24] <BoneBagMel> :(
[1:20:27] <%realm_forge> @peachy996 mick just hits so much harder
[1:20:28] <+RSNoon> paige is the best kind of broken

[1:21:33] <+Calek> @Onatamana ;_;
[1:21:36] <GeneralHysterics> ANOTHER ONE
[1:21:40] <SentientMN> @lion_kun its three levels and two slayer gates... id say about 5-6 hours
[1:21:49] <SentientMN> really worth it
[1:21:58] <geassguy360> pat you need to drop the sfx to like 70 so the music is audible lol

[1:24:01] <yourliteraldog> They should add a style meter to this game
[1:24:10] <%SilvaChariot0133> Just kill them before they kill you 4Head

[1:26:52] <%maenos2> DEATHS - 10 WE ATE DOUBLE DIGITS PEOPLE
[1:26:54] <Moondoggie25> gotta say, i like the new music, but it sure isnt as good as the base game stuff
[1:26:57] <%maenos2> are
[1:26:58] <cephas97> the dlc is dick hard
[1:26:59] <%crimsong0ddess> 10 deaths right?
[1:27:02] <SentientMN> this shit is happening because of the controller
[1:27:05] <khrispane> PepeLaugh :point_right:
[1:27:06] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt try focusing on grenading the cacodemons
[1:27:11] <%JD_Lars> I’m assuming this is not on normal?
[1:27:14] <%maenos2> @crimsong0ddess by my count yup
[1:27:22] <+Calek> Ultra Violence
[1:27:32] <1matheuw> psaGiefrail
[1:27:36] <Onatamana> Music is pretty good considering it was probably on super short notice due to whatever happened with/to Mick Gordon
[1:27:37] <+Nomenanza> the final room of this level took me around 30-40 minutes to beat alone. This DLC rocks
[1:27:51] <SentientMN> @moondoggie25 my thoughts exactly... mick is too good
[1:27:51] <dan_g_v> fak uf
[1:27:53] <%JD_Lars> Lol. Good luck Pat.
[1:27:58] <azacca_bitter> nice
[1:28:01] <%AncelDeLambert> alright, someone give Pat (and me) a hint: how do you kill the big Hell Knights?
[1:28:02] <cephas97> nightmare is fucking brutal
[1:28:03] <+Mr_Misanthropy> where will you be when heqartburn takes hold
[1:28:08] <Cici_TheMoonRabbit> @Onatamana Expect the next DLC to have the really good tracks
[1:28:10] <yourliteraldog> Also shield explosions do an insane amount of damage to enemies
[1:28:16] <+Calek> @AncelDeLambert chaingun
[1:28:19] <1matheuw> @AncelDeLambert shoot them i guess
[1:28:20] <%SilvaChariot0133> Shoot them until they die @AncelDeLambert
[1:28:22] <%SilvaChariot0133> Kappa
[1:28:22] <peachy996> @AncelDeLambert brrrrrrrr
[1:28:35] <%AncelDeLambert> sounds like that enemy type SUCKS ASS
[1:28:51] <+Calek> chaingun has a good stun rate against Hell Knight types
[1:28:53] <azacca_bitter> really? a hunter too?
[1:28:58] <1matheuw> NO CHECKPOINTS dont fuck it up
[1:29:02] <%Reveresao> ice bomb the Hunter, full auto the sled, switch to ballista.....
[1:29:04] <%Mopper_Rod> I wish Pat could hear my 5 year old daughter shit-talking him. Just to lower his morale more.
[1:29:04] <%AncelDeLambert> does Pat just have bad enemy focus?
[1:29:14] <%BLK_HRLQN_13> Are you winning, SON?
[1:29:23] <%realm_forge> @anceldelambert hit em with ice bomb, then double frags while dumping on them with a heavy weapon
[1:29:25] <OverlordedK> using freezebomb on that one zombie... lol
[1:29:28] <peachy996> Spicy
[1:29:30] <Onatamana> HARDSTUCK
[1:29:31] <+Calek> Pat also hasn't played in 6 months, and the DLC is really hard

[1:29:34] <%maenos2> Deaths - 11
[1:29:34] <dan_g_v> not high health and not much ammo!!
[1:29:36] <%DappercatEsquire> coward out
[1:29:36] <%AncelDeLambert> "priorities" that's the word I'm looking for. Who should Pat be prioritizing?
[1:29:38] <%the_vedo_show> oos
[1:29:40] <SentientMN> i like how this fight is nothing compared to the rest of the dlc
[1:29:42] <+GingerStrawhat> Pat is slowly morphing into DSP
[1:29:42] <cephas97> ice grenades!!!!!!!
[1:29:44] <andritt> Having fun Pat?
[1:29:46] <1matheuw> M O R T I S
[1:29:47] <%kingmemelord97> kill the carcarss pat hes the one that keeps fucking you over

[1:29:56] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> grenades dude
[1:29:56] <%SilvaChariot0133> need that armor
[1:29:57] <+Nomenanza> Yeah, this DLC is a rough welcome back after not playing Doom for months.
[1:30:00] <TheTakkster> Is Doom the Dark Souls of FPS?
[1:30:03] <%SirKeigan> BFG?
[1:30:05] <Giztech> still confident from yesterdays statement that you didn't need practice :D
[1:30:05] <%dj_xo98> blood punch rune pat
[1:30:08] <+MayorRev> @PatStaresAt pat here's the big question though, are you having fun
[1:30:14] <%maenos2> DEATHS ARE ELEVEN, SLAYER AIN'T MAKING IT TO HEAVEN
[1:30:14] <cephas97> we told you to practise!!!!
[1:30:15] <peachy996> @AncelDeLambert Every enemy that's not an Imp, Soldier or Gargoyle
[1:30:18] <+Calek> weirdly enough you have to prioritize the big guys because everything else infinitely respawns until the big guys are dead
[1:30:18] <%dj_xo98> use it
[1:30:20] <SentientMN> doom os like skyrim with guns
[1:30:20] <+Mr_Misanthropy> LUL
[1:30:22] <+GingerStrawhat> Does he have BFG ammo?
[1:30:24] <%the_vedo_show> aw geez
[1:30:27] <%realm_forge> @thetakkster more like the DMC of shooters

[1:30:38] <ulcaban> This is a FUCK ROOM
[1:30:39] <%DappercatEsquire> in retrospect, no
[1:30:40] <+GingerStrawhat> Well that answers my question
[1:30:42] <SentientMN> it really makes you FEEL like batman with Skyrim
[1:30:42] <peachy996> probably
[1:30:44] <Onatamana> Especially not on that ceiling
[1:30:45] <yourliteraldog> Not gonna lie boys I'm feeling pretty hot and bothered for some doom
[1:30:48] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt focus on grenading cacodemons for health and punch charges
[1:30:48] <+Nomenanza> I used it in that same room too, regretting it later bitterLOL
[1:30:49] <whitebatsy> Prob should have grinded some extra lives

[1:32:05] <dan_g_v> best chat
[1:32:05] <Crackensan> I don't know what Hugo and the team at ID was thinking; but some of these arena's are -incredibly- difficult. Like; the speedrunners and hardcore DooM guys make 'em look easy but these are all unholy creations
[1:32:05] <%1matheuw> psaCaco psaCaco now i can use the pat cacos
[1:32:07] <OverlordedK> god those shields are so obnoxious in the dlc
[1:32:07] <%mield916> Thanks for the KPOPlove @odetokale
[1:32:09] <%Odetokale> No problem!
[1:32:10] <brachydios777> Are we sure Pat isn’t a relative of Rich Evans?
[1:32:12] <%AncelDeLambert> are the shield-casting assholes infinite spawns too?
[1:32:14] <%SirKeigan> Odeto Kale is better. There's no going back

[1:32:22] <+GingerStrawhat> Time to bump down the Difficulty?
[1:32:23] <KaiserMario> Ready to give up yet?
[1:32:24] <%maenos2> deaths - 13
[1:32:25] <%drabberfaun535> side dash out of damage
[1:32:25] <yourliteraldog> Allegedly every encounter is designed to be completed with no bfg. Allegedly...
[1:32:26] <+Calek> @AncelDeLambert yup
[1:32:27] <%maenos2> jolliSad
[1:32:28] <%DappercatEsquire> @PatStaresAt maybe switch up your runes?
[1:32:29] <+Thelovelybison> also remember, full charge pulse buffs the pulse gun, and killing with regular AR bullets buffs missiles
[1:32:31] <SentientMN> PAT USE THE FUCKING ICE GRENADE
[1:32:34] <%AncelDeLambert> FUCK THAT
[1:32:39] <+Calek> oh shield casting, I don't think so
[1:32:42] <+KidsSeeGh0sts> pat you gotta shoot better
[1:32:51] <Onatamana> so when this is uploaded to youtube, can we get a winning attempt timestamp?
[1:32:51] <+Calek> I was thinking of soldiers with shields
[1:33:00] <cephas97> ask god for help
[1:33:07] <%Mr_November> I remember this one vividly
[1:33:07] <peachy996> Frag Grenade also does cluster bombs on kill so keep that in mind too
[1:33:10] <%AncelDeLambert> so if Pat overloads those shields, does he get an AOE out of it?
[1:33:17] <%maenos2> deaths - 14
[1:33:20] <yourliteraldog> Shield Overloads are super worth it
[1:33:20] <+THE_CYB3R_FOX> LIVE DIE REPEAT. Starring pat stares at
[1:33:21] <+Calek> yup

[1:33:38] <%AncelDeLambert> oh, he should be abusing the SHIT out of that, then
[1:33:41] <%Birdigalore> PUNCH THAT BELLY
[1:33:41] <SentientMN> @anceldelambert only if theyre close
[1:33:43] <%realm_forge> A good start is to flame belch the trash mobs before chainsaw I got them for max return
[1:33:44] <%SirKeigan> Always overload the shields with the Plasma Rifle, it's an AOE
[1:33:45] <DSD24> basic punch is a bunch of weaksauce
[1:33:46] <BurningAc3s> woolieGASM woolieGASM woolieGASM woolieGASM woolieGASM woolieGASM woolieGASM
[1:33:47] <yourliteraldog> @AncelDeLambert A big one
[1:33:55] <cephas97> god declined
[1:33:56] <%SirKeigan> PLASMA RIFLE
[1:34:03] <Cici_TheMoonRabbit> Plasma Rifle hard counters shields
[1:34:06] <%AzureGale> Nah, Marauders will always be wht eworst
[1:34:08] <Onatamana> Were the shield guys changed for the DLC? I swear to god their shield placements are better than ever.
[1:34:12] <NicholasOsen_> parried
[1:34:13] <%DappercatEsquire> pat trying Consecutive Normal Punches on that Mancubus to little success
[1:34:25] <%realm_forge> Heat blast plasma rifle melts those bastards real nice
[1:34:36] <%Mr_November> I find myself marching around this room almost 90 percent of the time with the plasma gun
[1:34:46] <valriot> need more GUNTRICKSWORD level of weapon switching
[1:34:48] <%SilvaChariot0133> Super shotty REAL useful with this shit for farming armor and getting out of the clusterfuck
[1:34:51] <%AncelDeLambert> this is why I'm not gonna ever try Infinite, this game'll melt my poor scrub brain
[1:34:57] <%SirKeigan> Plasma barely damages the big guys
[1:34:59] <SentientMN> marauders are not that hard and they're not even the worst fight in this dlc
[1:34:59] <%SirKeigan> Use real bullets
[1:35:02] <CappuccinoGuil> Does he have "longer stuns"? Helps at getting health and controlling enemies
[1:35:02] <geassguy360> gotta rebind jump and dash for that to happen bruh

[2:07:01] <stardustcrusad3r> god i wish that were me

[2:11:50] <Onatamana> Id Software be like "Hey, lets take a page out of those bullshit Doom WADs and trap the player if a 5ft by 5ft room with a cyberdemon."

[2:14:00] <boywunderkind> The music is strangely heroic?
[2:14:00] <+tigerfang86> you think you're SO COOL
[2:14:02] <%mighty_max_t> gottem
[2:14:05] <%SirKeigan> Woolie has so much other stuff going on right now
[2:14:09] <%SirKeigan> Maybe after something finishes
[2:14:11] <%1matheuw> back broken
[2:14:20] <%maenos2> so far this actually seems easier.
[2:14:20] <MasterTonberry23> geez woolz is always so busy XD
[2:14:23] <BliVru> @MasterTonberry23 He's usy with Call of Duty now
[2:14:24] <boywunderkind> did Mick do the music for this DLC?
[2:14:32] <+Calek> snake lady's!
[2:14:33] <+Nomenanza> no
[2:14:34] <Saltmeisterr> no
[2:14:38] <%1matheuw> time for sneks
[2:14:41] <knotsundownsyndrome> @boywunderkind no, it was hulshult and levi
[2:14:44] <Saltmeisterr> its andrew something
[2:14:44] <%maenos2> spoke too soon
[2:14:46] <GeneralHysterics> whiplashes go die
[2:14:49] <geassguy360> ROCKET LOCK ON BURST
[2:14:51] <Saltmeisterr> hulshult
[2:14:55] <%captain_thickthighs> wasn't there some controversy about Mick and his soundtrack while ago
[2:14:55] <MasterTonberry23> wait hulshult did the music for this? hot damn
[2:14:58] <OverlordedK> oof
[2:15:00] <+Nomenanza> David Levy and Andrew Hulshult did the music for this as Mick ended his relation with bethesda
[2:15:00] <%1matheuw> DENIED
[2:15:00] <peachy996> The dream is Mick and Hulshult collaborating on a piece someday
[2:15:00] <yourliteraldog> sploorch
[2:15:01] <%AzureGale> YOU DIED
[2:15:02] <%SirKeigan> Yea
[2:15:04] <+twohitgood> is it just me or do the arenas in the DLC feel too "arena like" rather than like level progression?
[2:15:05] <+oktavia_von> charboDead
[2:15:08] <%SirKeigan> Getting caught on things is happening a lot in the DLC
[2:15:11] <penitentpendant> Body Blocked
[2:15:12] <%1matheuw> hulshut is making it big
[2:15:12] <%maenos2> Deaths - 17
[2:15:16] <Cici_TheMoonRabbit> Those Whiplashes are tough, but at least they're not invisible.
[2:15:17] <KaiserMario> Are ya winning, son?
[2:15:18] <geassguy360> just you
[2:15:19] <%SirKeigan> Too many enemies in too small an arena
[2:15:20] <+twohitgood> nevermind
[2:15:22] <+Thelovelybison> Whiplashes die in one hit by the fully charged ballista scythe btw
[2:15:24] <AncyentMarinere> PowerUpL PogChamp PowerUpR
[2:15:38] <%Anime_Flux> Face to your fist style, how do you like it?
[2:15:45] <%primarch_lupercal> @twohitgood wasn't the main game similar
[2:15:54] <geassguy360> for the love of god stop walking into the mancubi
[2:16:13] <%SirKeigan> The main game had more area to go through between arenas
[2:16:16] <%riderstrike152> Yo chat, did pat trigger the Korone Easter egg yet?
[2:16:21] <%alcors_wisdom> uhh
[2:16:25] <MasterTonberry23> i mean even the main game was almost all arenas, so it was more like Painkiller than classic Doom
[2:16:28] <%alcors_wisdom> anyone else loose the stream
[2:16:28] <%1matheuw> i think not
[2:16:31] <%mighty_max_t> IIRC, Mick was taking too long to do the music and was being pressured to speed it up, right?
[2:16:31] <%maenos2> @riderstrike152 at the stsrt
[2:16:40] <%riderstrike152> Coool
[2:16:42] <%TheWinged7> @Anime_Flux how about my nuts to your foot style?
[2:17:08] <%Anime_Flux> LUL
[2:17:09] <%AFlyingTaco1> @mighty_max_t Not pressured, he just never met his deadlines
[2:17:12] <+twohitgood> @twohitgood yeah, i didn't realize he was on a challenge right now.
[2:17:18] <MasterTonberry23> @mighty_max_t pretty much,
[2:17:19] <+HellHunter120> What difficulty is this on?
[2:17:21] <+Thelovelybison> at least micks work with BMTH is really good
[2:17:26] <godzookylives> what difficulty is he playing on
[2:17:27] <$ringabal> This difficulty is VERY BAD
[2:17:27] <%Laecerelius> You teleported behind him
[2:17:27] <%1matheuw> more like he signed a contract he couldnt fulfill and got shafted because he made a unecessary amount of noise in social medias
[2:17:29] <%doc_ock_rokc> Local Slayer to angry to move through space
[2:17:31] <+LandOfTheWay> NOTHIN PERSONNEL KID
[2:17:40] <valriot> Yes Pat
[2:17:43] <valriot> Thats Doom
[2:17:46] <%SilvaChariot0133> never not be moving
[2:17:48] <+Nomenanza> yeah, never stop moving
[2:17:54] <peachy996> There it is that's the way
[2:17:58] <penitentpendant> Move towards the safety
[2:18:00] <valriot> Its been that way since the game came out LUL
[2:18:05] <MasterTonberry23> moving to where you can see instead of walking blindly into something? you might be onto something Pat
[2:18:05] <%Jekado> boy twitch streaming can't handle this game
[2:18:06] <Onatamana> backpedaling is death
[2:18:13] <+Calek> move to where they aren't and you'll be fine
[2:18:14] <+Nomenanza> because of increased fodder counter per arena there are increased cases of enemies just collision trapping you
[2:18:18] <@SoFarFetched> watching this doom stream makes me feel like Im back in time when Animal Crossing New Horizon came out.
[2:18:27] <+THE_CYB3R_FOX> So to win DOOM you have to play it like DOOM.
[2:18:31] <valriot> SPEED
[2:18:31] <AncyentMarinere> This one room took me bout an hour
[2:18:35] <+tigerfang86> Animal Crossing Eternal
[2:18:39] <+tigerfang86> Doom New Horizon
[2:18:42] <%1matheuw> uhh what?
[2:18:43] <MasterTonberry23> @SoFarFetched Doomguy for smash so he can hang out with his friend isabelle
[2:18:44] <+Thelovelybison> i love this game to death but i wish the non blood punch melee had a bit more knockback
[2:18:57] <%1matheuw> how can you move into somenthing you cant see?
[2:19:01] <geassguy360> also hard playing with any speed when dash is on fucking B
[2:19:09] <@SoFarFetched> psaGib DoomGuy and Isabelle are best friends forever
[2:19:14] <%mighty_max_t> It's crazy how this came out as the pandemic started. Like, it seems like a lifetime ago
[2:19:19] <MasterTonberry23> Hey this isnt so hard! Kappa
[2:19:20] <%alcors_wisdom> the heavy is dED!?
[2:19:23] <+Nomenanza> too easy huh

[2:20:26] <valriot> EVERYONE IS HERE

[2:20:36] <%SirKeigan> The forest looks so cool dude
[2:20:41] <whitebatsy> And they don't stop coming
[2:20:43] <Onatamana> Suddenly everything is rethinking that weapon mod
[2:20:52] <suikudo> mega miss
[2:20:59] <suikudo> that was like 4 rockets
[2:21:07] <MasterTonberry23> oh great, a doom hunter. whats next a marauder?
[2:21:21] <%SirKeigan> Doom Hunter now. Okay they're just throwing everything at you. That's not hard, that's just Lost Izalith LUL
[2:21:21] <geassguy360> pat is in the zone rn
[2:21:27] <%1matheuw> why not two marauders
[2:21:31] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> So, when does the Icon of Sin show up?
[2:21:34] <%luftraumm1> psaBig_HF
[2:21:34] <%mighty_max_t> Nah TWO archvilles
[2:21:37] <+Nomenanza> @Onatamana experienced players iirc figured that mod out a long time ago, where you can microwave lock an enemy by spamming it in short bursts while switching to other weapons in between
[2:21:37] <MasterTonberry23> Pat please dont bork this up last second
[2:21:50] <+Teintstein> what's up y'all - how bad has pat getting his cheeks clapped? I took a nap earlier when he just started out the dlc
[2:21:56] <%Ranryu692> what do you mean, "you people?"
[2:21:59] <suikudo> Pat please bork this up last second?
[2:22:06] <cephas97> come on Patrick!!!!!!
[2:22:09] <%bread_assassin> I never played this, but it feels kinda like what DMC would be if it were an FPS.
[2:22:13] <%maenos2> @teintstein 17 deaths and counting
[2:22:16] <%alcors_wisdom> @mighty_max_t "jeez pat how come your mom lets you have TWO archphiles?'

[2:22:32] <MasterTonberry23> @bread_assassin a lot of people have made that observation LUL
[2:22:34] <%AFlyingTaco1> @bread_assassin That pretty much sums it up, honestly
[2:22:35] <+cascadepersona> "The only good demon is a dead demon, ey Slayer?"
[2:22:41] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt You shouldn't speak to the diferently mortal like that

[2:23:16] <brachydios777> GG
[2:23:18] <%SilvaChariot0133> Would HIGHLY recommend the weakpoint rune
[2:23:19] <%SirKeigan> Watchu get?
[2:23:19] <+THE_CYB3R_FOX> Well done
[2:23:19] <AncyentMarinere> PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[2:23:21] <MasterTonberry23> Never doubted you for a second Pat
[2:23:21] <GeneralHysterics> easier than some level 2 fights
[2:23:21] <%Ner234> Pat sweating right now
[2:23:22] <%saadi90> Awesome!
[2:23:22] <penitentpendant> I think you have more health coming out than going in
[2:23:22] <Zebroneath> 4th rune
[2:23:22] <%SirKeigan> NEW RUNES
[2:23:22] <%doc_ock_rokc> Punch shit
[2:23:23] <%Ynkubus_> Now breathe
[2:23:25] <%realm_forge> psaCaco psaCaco psaCaco
[2:23:26] <$RealThiele> glory
[2:23:28] <%1matheuw> THANOS RUNES THANOS RUNES
[2:23:30] <%Typhaeon> Jim Norton is tired and confused
[2:23:30] <+Calek> I went with the third one
[2:23:30] <geassguy360> last is best
[2:23:32] <+Thelovelybison> 1st one is super clutch, 2nd is really good if you have the lives
[2:23:32] <%drabberfaun535> that looks like a missing texture
[2:23:36] <+THE_CYB3R_FOX> For glory
[2:23:36] <%captain_thickthighs> the doom complete nut
[2:23:37] <%SirKeigan> THIRD ONE
[2:23:37] <Zebroneath> Blood Punch is really nice
[2:23:38] <%transporterthesequel> reporting Pat for using slurs for the Mortally Challenged.
[2:23:38] <cephas97> weak point
[2:23:38] <Guardiansaiyan> BUY IT ALL
[2:23:39] <Saltmeisterr> 3
[2:23:40] <%maybefalco> 3rd is the most useful
[2:23:41] <peachy996> Oh so that's what these are
[2:23:42] <%SirKeigan> THIRD ONE MOST AGGRESSIVE
[2:23:43] <%donkymagooterson> watching this game feels like riding a roller coaster somehow
[2:23:44] <Saltmeisterr> easily
[2:23:46] <$ringabal> Blood Punch for SURE
[2:23:48] <%Ner234> Third one
[2:23:50] <+Nomenanza> I initially went for 1 but found it hyper situational
[2:23:53] <Cici_TheMoonRabbit> Desperate Punch might suite him more
[2:23:54] <peachy996> I didn't do the gate so I'm in level 2 without one
[2:23:55] <$RealThiele> big paunch
[2:23:56] <MasterTonberry23> boring, but practical
[2:24:02] <geassguy360> YUP GOOD CHOICE
[2:24:04] <%SirKeigan> Third, then First, then Second
[2:24:07] <AncyentMarinere> I went with the life one
[2:24:11] <%maenos2> thi4d
[2:24:11] <%realm_forge> Victory chug
[2:24:16] <$ringabal> OH
[2:24:18] <spawnzie> Ended up liking big punch the most
[2:24:19] <+tigerfang86> bishi bishi BREAKY BREAKY point
[2:24:21] <+Thelovelybison> life one is super good in extra life mode :)
[2:24:24] <%AzureGale> Power creep woooooooooo
[2:24:24] <+Teintstein> !uptime
[2:24:25] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 24m.
[2:24:25] <geassguy360> i like them all but yeah that third
[2:24:27] <%SirKeigan> You get four runes now
[2:24:31] <%1matheuw> THANOS RUNE
[2:24:32] <MasterTonberry23> yeah probably
[2:24:33] <+Nomenanza> maybe?
[2:24:34] <geassguy360> no idea hope so
[2:24:34] <%SirKeigan> yes?
[2:24:37] <%aishman> Don't think so since this is a stand alone no?
[2:24:39] <+Nomenanza> never tested it
[2:24:44] <MasterTonberry23> so i guess if youre having trouble you can go back with your new stuff
[2:24:50] <Guardiansaiyan> tired?
[2:24:52] <Pyon84> Doing ok there buddy?
[2:24:56] <+Estuko> noone who answered has given a definite answer lol
[2:24:59] <$RealThiele> id imagine so since you can go back into levles with cheats
[2:24:59] <MasterTonberry23> Pat looking like he just survived D-Day
[2:25:01] <penitentpendant> Pat Melts
[2:25:01] <brachydios777> Assume so
[2:25:01] <+Thelovelybison> i havent tested it but i dont think so since you have to make a seperate dlc save file
[2:25:03] <%Anime_Flux> it's intense as shit
[2:25:04] <%DianaTheAscian> ???
[2:25:04] <spawnzie> Doom hard man
[2:25:06] <peachy996> That's the good feeling
[2:25:06] <geassguy360> this DLC is an experience
[2:25:07] <%SilvaChariot0133> it's an ordeal
[2:25:08] <BliVru> you wanna take5?
[2:25:08] <+Teintstein> 17 deaths in 2 and a half hours, so like a death every 10ish minutes
[2:25:10] <peachy996> Cry with joy
[2:25:16] <%Laecerelius> Your eyes are dying from the intense staring at the screen?
[2:25:16] <suikudo> Buttholes arent meant to be clutched this long with no break
[2:25:16] <Guardiansaiyan> Thats rough Buddy VirtualHug
[2:25:20] <penitentpendant> This is the exact emotional opposite to the Amnesia stream
[2:25:23] <Onatamana> Doom Eternal DLC is the Dark Souls of video games
[2:25:24] <%luftraumm1> felt like that playing DMCV
[2:25:27] <DontChuckle98> Terry Bogard: “Are you okay?”
[2:25:28] <+Teintstein> this game is really exhausting
[2:25:28] <$RealThiele> *ripping and tearing emotions*
[2:25:28] <Wolfwood315> we're here for you pat
[2:25:29] <geassguy360> Doom is kinda supposed to be brutal a lot of the time. at least by ep4 which is what this is
[2:25:29] <$connorfromearth> you got this pat
[2:25:31] <spawnzie> And this still the FIRST LEVEL
[2:25:36] <%toolofparanoia> Because its so beautiful Pat. Game good.
[2:25:44] <MasterTonberry23> after that a minor encounter like this is like a pleasant summer walk
[2:25:44] <Guardiansaiyan> @luftraumm1 I am sure Dante is in here somewhere
[2:25:48] <brachydios777> Oh shit!
[2:25:53] <suikudo> YES
[2:25:54] <MasterTonberry23> nevermind LUL
[2:25:55] <%Laecerelius> Wow
[2:26:00] <%SirKeigan> blast damage
[2:26:02] <Guardiansaiyan> lol
[2:26:06] <%maenos2> Deaths - 18
[2:26:07] <+Teintstein> time to reset the clock
[2:26:09] <%aishman> @PatStaresAt Hey man you okay? Is the game frustrating you? It's okay to take a break man
[2:26:10] <%cvp5127> Become doog
[2:26:12] <KingVantq> 1 level per Stream for sure
[2:26:14] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Guardiansaiyan knowing dante he is in the cafeteria
[2:26:15] <shadowcrisis> teared and ripped
[2:26:15] <%captain_thickthighs> it's like dark souls with guns
[2:26:15] <%toolofparanoia> He's turning into dog
[2:26:15] <+Nomenanza> I found the final encounter in this level much harder than the Slayer Gate
[2:26:17] <+twohitgood> did they give that one enemy anything special other than a gamertag?
[2:26:18] <geassguy360> srsly rebind dash it makes shit easier
[2:26:18] <caja_de_ojos> doog
[2:26:19] <$ringabal> OH MAAAAAAN
[2:26:19] <%realm_forge> SPLAT
[2:26:19] <suikudo> i would have died
[2:26:23] <%alcors_wisdom> man been reading a bunch of 40k books lately and now all i can think about when i see the demons are nergels blight legions
[2:26:24] <suikudo> i would have rolled over and died
[2:26:31] <%Anime_Flux> LUL
[2:26:31] <+NitronStreams> DO IT AGAIN
[2:26:36] <Onatamana> It's oddly on brand for pat to rip and tear his way through a slayer gate only to immediately die on the next regular encounter
[2:26:37] <$RealThiele> the price is wrong, orbman
[2:26:38] <peachy996> Oh don't worry checkpoints are generous
[2:26:38] <re0killer> pat, looks like u dint see that
[2:26:38] <%toolofparanoia> almost freakout lol
[2:26:40] <%realm_forge> LUL LUL LUL
[2:26:40] <peachy996> rn
[2:26:47] <MasterTonberry23> oh yeah if it didnt save your progress there, something would have gotten broken, either your controller, your monitor, or something else
[2:26:49] <Guardiansaiyan> @doc_ock_rokc eating all the pizza...Vergil keeps stealing the pineapple ones
[2:26:54] <%doc_ock_rokc> @alcors_wisdom does this make Doomguy Cain?
[2:26:59] <Klarrann3> does anyone know if he's done the Korone easter egg?
[2:27:00] <+Teintstein> @alcors_wisdom which series? I've been on a massive 40k binge over the past couple of months
[2:27:09] <+GingerStrawhat> ***
[2:27:10] <%alcors_wisdom> @doc_ock_rokc hell yeah
[2:27:19] <%captain_thickthighs> @alcors_wisdom yo imagine this game of like a 40K mod
[2:27:19] <re0killer> larxaStudy

[2:27:29] <rufus2k2> @Klarrann3 the WHAT
[2:27:32] <%toolofparanoia> This game isn't the good kind of punish its the bad kind of punish
[2:27:35] <+Nomenanza> what is the logic behind empowered demons? a demon that managed to kill another player while they were online?
[2:27:40] <+Estuko> @Teintstein the binge combined with couple of months is such an intimidating amount of information lol
[2:27:47] <$RealThiele> doomguy is the emperor
[2:27:47] <%doc_ock_rokc> @alcors_wisdom I'm not picturing Doomguy as having imposter syndrome
[2:27:49] <%SirKeigan> It's just an invasion
[2:27:51] <Cici_TheMoonRabbit> @Nomenanza Yes
[2:27:56] <%toolofparanoia> the kind of punish that involves you getting effed in the a
[2:27:57] <%alcors_wisdom> @captain_thickthighs i want something like that so bad i love 40k but im an fps player

[2:28:16] <%doc_ock_rokc> @RealThiele He might be angron
[2:28:19] <Klarrann3> @rufus2k2 hitting the chainsaw button 4 times in a row in the Runes menu does a Korone reference
[2:28:23] <%SirKeigan> rockets kill you when you're close dude
[2:28:25] <%SirKeigan> back off

[2:29:49] <%captain_thickthighs> LaCroix
[2:29:50] <%SirKeigan> because Hugo Martin is a troll LUL
[2:29:51] <+Nomenanza> it's like doomguy goes "whaaa how breathe do"
[2:29:52] <mandalor89> is he still doing it?
[2:29:53] <+getinthetent> man why is vidya swimming always so SHIT
[2:29:54] <%Valdorick> Doomguy can't swim
[2:29:55] <spawnzie> Yeah the water mechanic in the DLC is fucking stupid
[2:29:56] <$RealThiele> Pat Swims at
[2:29:56] <CappuccinoGuil> @Zooperton isn't that just vodka?
[2:29:57] <%Dakuu75> The swimming is honestly the worst part of this game. no one will dissagree
[2:30:02] <geassguy360> he doesnt need to breathe, but his lungs still dont like having water in them
[2:30:03] <Dutchpotato> Jesus the swimming is so bad in this game
[2:30:06] <%toolofparanoia> at iD software, GAME BREAK YOU
[2:30:11] <+oktavia_von> its gamer girl bath water
[2:30:12] <+Estuko> @alcors_wisdom I know almost nothing, sorry about that lol. I mean there's the 3rd game that seems more closer(?)
[2:30:12] <tolloponik> your drowning Armor go Down?
[2:30:18] <%Ner234> Pat sounds like he's gonna fall over LUL
[2:30:19] <%doc_ock_rokc> That little suit wouldn't fit
[2:30:23] <ammobasket> regular swimming is pretty shit tho tbh
[2:30:24] <%captain_thickthighs> is there any game that has decent water levels? in a fps
[2:30:26] <%Dakuu75> and it's ONLY because it's so finiky when you try to get OUT
[2:30:27] <shadowcrisis> sore anus, your bum bum says me no likey water. pew pew
[2:30:29] <MasterTonberry23> Okay NOW you can go in the water
[2:30:30] <%alcors_wisdom> @Teintstein yeah im on like the 6th book and theyre just now finish with malcador 3
[2:30:32] <%arcielardor> is Pat crying?
[2:30:33] <%cvp5127> why
[2:30:33] <+Calek> didn't need this suit in the main game why need it now
[2:30:35] <geassguy360> how? the swimming is totally fine, just fucking literally never stop dashing
[2:30:35] <Saltmeisterr> what?
[2:30:37] <$RealThiele> rad suit was too much effort for this section
[2:30:37] <%Ner234> ???
[2:30:38] <Zooperton> it's like the radiation suit
[2:30:38] <suikudo> LUL
[2:30:39] <%maybefalco> alternative rad suit
[2:30:41] <%aishman> Now get in the water!
[2:30:41] <Cici_TheMoonRabbit> The swimming is such a small part I don't know why they even bothered
[2:30:43] <+THE_CYB3R_FOX> On the minigun you should use the shield it’ll help you analyze the situation and breath for a moment
[2:30:44] <%Ner234> Couldn't he swim before???
[2:30:46] <%kingmemelord97> Did I miss any major plot points outside of him getting the key ?
[2:30:46] <shadowcrisis> super cereal
[2:30:47] <+Pyroclase> He's the SCUBA Slayer now.
[2:30:50] <+Nomenanza> you want to push a button in that room too to unlock shit
[2:30:51] <KingVantq> puzzle encountered
[2:30:53] <geassguy360> he doesnt need to breathe, but his lungs still dont like having water in them
[2:30:54] <Onatamana> Ah, so the slayer can breathe just fine in the poison water.
[2:30:58] <spawnzie> Even though you dont need to bretah in the base game
[2:30:59] <brachydios777> Switch!
[2:31:03] <%Anime_Flux> god I'd be awful at this game...
[2:31:05] <%realm_forge> SCUBA STEVE
[2:31:07] <+Pyroclase> I think you just missed a button
[2:31:12] <%alcors_wisdom> @Estuko is there? i hadnt seen that yet
[2:31:13] <%dj_xo98> pat switch in room
[2:31:16] <+Calek> @PatStaresAt button the room you got the dive suit in
[2:31:16] <brachydios777> Button!
[2:31:17] <%WackyGear> down
[2:31:23] <+Nomenanza> I think the damage in water is supposed to be the ocean pressure but considering this is just a pool it makes no sense at all
[2:31:23] <$RealThiele> Scuba Steve HATES smash melee
[2:31:29] <%Zulrez> Zulrez subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 12 months! is DOOM guy actually SCUBA Steve?
[2:31:32] <+Estuko> @alcors_wisdom it was one of the trailers released this year in that big event, looks super neat
[2:31:34] <%AFlyingTaco1> This swimming mechanic is so stupid. Like why even?
[2:31:34] <+Teintstein> definitely wouldn't have guessed swimming was a mechanic they'd add
[2:31:36] <+Thelovelybison> yeah he's used to poison water so regular water is too basic, its like swimming in soap
[2:31:49] <%Jrocy247> Y'know I'm shocked Doomguy's heavy ass can swim
[2:31:59] <%alcors_wisdom> @Estuko ill have to take a look after the stream thanks for the heads up
[2:32:02] <shadowcrisis> soon you will learn the ability to take a bath, you filthy filthy, spartan

[2:34:17] <Zebroneath> Just tested. It seems as of now, you can't carry any of the runes you get from the DLC back to the main game.
[2:34:18] <%alcors_wisdom> mistakes into miracles~~~~
[2:34:23] <%luftraumm1> that hallway was weid as hell
[2:34:27] <+Nomenanza> iirc invisible pinkies don't have the same ultra-hard armour as normal pinkies do
[2:34:30] <%kingmemelord97> Wait is he still on stage one ?
[2:34:32] <%Ner234> Shit's on fire yo
[2:34:33] <%toolofparanoia> is it the Trump boat parade?

[2:35:20] <%Ner234> Nice save
[2:35:20] <%doc_ock_rokc> @ringabal the OIL in the ocean is burning
[2:35:23] <GeneralHysterics> we could tell
[2:35:27] <+Teintstein> we're coming up on 10 minutes since the last death, so he's probably due another death anytime
[2:35:29] <%kingmemelord97> is this the longest dlc ever made ?!
[2:35:31] <$RealThiele> its a demon baby
[2:35:37] <MasterTonberry23> Alert! Empowered demon approaching fast!

[2:36:21] <$RealThiele> SUP
[2:36:27] <spawnzie> You ee an archvile you kill an archvile
[2:36:45] <+Pyroclase> YEP
[2:36:49] <%SilvaChariot0133> Just cut the fucker
[2:36:50] <%Monkeyweed21> Thats not true @PatStaresAt
[2:36:52] <+Nomenanza> totally
[2:36:52] <%cvp5127> yup
[2:36:53] <%Dakuu75> yep
[2:36:53] <%maybefalco> YUP
[2:36:53] <%captain_thickthighs> some of this enemy placement is evil 😂
[2:36:54] <+KidsSeeGh0sts> yup
[2:36:55] <+Pyroclase> Save them for ARchviles and Tyrants
[2:36:56] <geassguy360> no bro the first one was before the crucible
[2:36:57] <$Futurecity10> Nope, you fight a archvile before getting a crucible
[2:36:57] <+Nahual_Amini> But they don't
[2:36:59] <$ringabal> Man, this Seraphim better be the hypest holy SMT looking shit
[2:36:59] <%SirKeigan> nope
[2:36:59] <xanerts> it did beforw tho
[2:37:00] <Saltmeisterr> Same with the tyrant too
[2:37:02] <Cici_TheMoonRabbit> Totally right
[2:37:03] <Zebroneath> I agree. Also the Tyrants.
[2:37:04] <toyforus235> sure i did pat
[2:37:04] <spawnzie> the first Arhcvile is before
[2:37:04] <MasterTonberry23> the crucible, aka the "i dont wanna deal with this archvile the honest way" button
[2:37:09] <%toolofparanoia> god this really is a one stream per level. unless we get to go back to the doom fortress
[2:37:10] <%1matheuw> archviles are the scum of the earth
[2:37:10] <+tigerfang86> still right
[2:37:12] <Cici_TheMoonRabbit> You only fight 1 Archville before Crucible
[2:37:13] <$RealThiele> tyrant + archvile solver
[2:37:15] <geassguy360> yes lol all the following ones were
[2:37:18] <geassguy360> it was a trap
[2:37:20] <%SirKeigan> Still no. I used the BFG on them
[2:37:22] <%realm_forge> They did it before you got the crucible
[2:37:24] <%AzureGale> Always shoot the medic first
[2:37:24] <Bustahhwulf> so pat admits cowardice 😂
[2:37:25] <BliVru> @PatStaresAt First one had a bug were it didn't show any info about it
[2:37:29] <+Nomenanza> this dlc also showcases just how EVIL the carcass x mancubi combo is
[2:37:31] <%Dakuu75> I think there was an objective that required you to kill one a certain way though. at one point. so you couldn't one-shot it
[2:37:32] <CappuccinoGuil> "Here's Archville. And here's the solution to Archville" xD
[2:37:36] <spawnzie> y'all dont fight the tyrants?
[2:37:40] <+Atomic_ColliderSG> BUT you had the BFG for the first Archville
[2:37:50] <+tigerfang86> sick FIRE SEA in the background btw
[2:37:52] <%SirKeigan> Seriously, why no Pinky's ?
[2:37:55] <+tigerfang86> check that shit out
[2:38:01] <$RealThiele> PLA HEE MAH
[2:38:05] <Josef_Stryker> Carcasses continue to be major assholes
[2:38:09] <+Atomic_ColliderSG> tyrants are a joke
[2:38:11] <Cici_TheMoonRabbit> @SirKeigan Saving them for the later levels
[2:38:19] <shadowcrisis> tickle the pickle...tickle that pickle...tickle the fudge out of that pickle
[2:38:19] <%SilvaChariot0133> "Why is water on fire!?"
[2:38:20] <%SirKeigan> I guess
[2:38:22] <BliVru> @spawnzie Hey man I fought them in a purple room I earn the right to cheese them
[2:38:24] <%mighty_max_t> Have there been any major lore/reveals or just mainly combat?
[2:38:25] <%SirKeigan> You need armor not health. Do more flame
[2:38:25] <%realm_forge> Ah yes the destroyer blade: the thinking man’s gun
[2:38:33] <$RealThiele> water is on fire cause oil floats
[2:38:38] <+Nomenanza> @spawnzie tyrants honestly dont hold as much utility power as Archviles, so archvile will always take priority over tyrants who you can just juke
[2:39:07] <suikudo> is this still only lvl 1?
[2:39:08] <+tigerfang86> PUNCH
[2:39:12] <%doc_ock_rokc> @realm_forge a man in combat without his sword is improperly dressed - "Mad Jack" Churchill
[2:39:13] <peachy996> Still the sheer number of Tyrants you fight in Base and DLC
[2:39:16] <+tigerfang86> THE TOTEM'S OUT
[2:39:16] <MasterTonberry23> theres your big shit
[2:39:19] <%primarch_lupercal> dont jinx it
[2:39:21] <Cici_TheMoonRabbit> OH GOD NOT THE BUFF TOTEMS
[2:39:33] <$RealThiele> buff totem ACTUAL worst enemy
[2:39:34] <GeneralHysterics> he's so good at predicting the pain
[2:39:50] <%1matheuw> is that a bugged archvile spell?
[2:39:58] <MasterTonberry23> pats played enough vidya games to see where this is going
[2:40:14] <+tigerfang86> Give em the NHL SlapShits pat
[2:40:52] <%Mr_November> I'm so glad Pokemon DLC comes out tomorrow to nurse my pain from these levels
[2:41:03] <Aydarkzero> hows Pat treating the old gods?
[2:41:04] <%SirKeigan> SHIELD
[2:41:20] <%Monkeyweed21> Why isnt Pat using the super shotgun?
[2:41:28] <%luftraumm1> fuck this demon in particular
[2:41:34] <GeneralHysterics> shield isn't FOUR MINIGUNS IN ONE

[2:41:45] <%luftraumm1> i think pt forgot the super shotgun exists
[2:41:48] <%SilvaChariot0133> Fight Forever!
[2:41:49] <peachy996> There's a lot of weapons and strats to juggle in your head
[2:41:51] <MasterTonberry23> WHO ELSE WANTS SOME

[2:41:58] <Guardiansaiyan> thats WHY
[2:41:58] <Kronark> Because more
[2:41:59] <+Pyroclase> This DLC makes you kill all the imps and zombies first, it's weird
[2:42:00] <$ringabal> WHY IS MY BOSS MUSIC STILL PLAYING
[2:42:01] <+THE_CYB3R_FOX> Use the Woolie gun!
[2:42:02] <%Anime_Flux> that was just the warmup fight
[2:42:05] <%BoxNavy> Jebaited
[2:42:05] <%Ner234> SourPls

[2:42:12] <+Calek> that was weird
[2:42:12] <+oktavia_von> "why do I hear boss music"
[2:42:13] <spawnzie> Prolly just an imp or soldier
[2:42:13] <Cici_TheMoonRabbit> Nevermind
[2:42:15] <%toolofparanoia> THE METAL WILL LIVE ON
[2:42:18] <peachy996> Makin ya sweat lol
[2:42:20] <%BoxNavy> i think the game fucked up a bit
[2:42:22] <+GingerStrawhat> I guess that Imp fucked off
[2:42:28] <gekizenbu> @Dakuu75 composer not appearing in this DLC LUL
[2:42:29] <KaiserMario> Shit's broke
[2:42:31] <geassguy360> that last imp ran off into a corner and died of fear thats what that was
[2:42:36] <+tigerfang86> :)

[2:42:46] <%kingmemelord97> yey yey yey
[2:42:47] <+GingerStrawhat> this is exactly what I wanted
[2:42:48] <%SirKeigan> It's just room after room. Not very inspired, to be honest
[2:42:55] <+LandOfTheWay> THE RIDE NEVER ENDS
[2:42:56] <geassguy360> no rest, just like late game doom should be
[2:43:02] <azacca_bitter> This is unreasonably triggering my shadenfreude
[2:43:04] <Onatamana> I think Pat wants to end the stream now.
[2:43:14] <suikudo> I just wish the first doom had something this relentless
[2:43:15] <%Anime_Flux> Player_Relaxation=False
[2:43:16] <+GingerStrawhat> You Rip and Tear Patrick until it's done
[2:43:23] <suikudo> I like 2016 more than this one

[2:43:32] <brambobelurkin> @gekizenbu I started the DLC and it just didnt sound the same. Had to play Meathook in the background
[2:43:35] <%1matheuw> empower this nutz
[2:43:35] <%AzureGale> A demon-powered penis sounds scary
[2:43:37] <umbrellaswereawesome> Oh, this level's just the warmup.

[2:56:08] <$Afterman_> shoot*
[2:56:09] <+Thelovelybison> marauders are probably my second favorite enemy
[2:56:10] <+Nomenanza> honestly, it is the part AFTER the double marauders that is harder
[2:56:14] <%maenos2> this seems...oddly non chaotic.
[2:56:18] <gamerform> tonari no seinferudo
[2:56:33] <MasterTonberry23> did you ever have to fight two marauders at once in the base game?
[2:56:39] <+gammerkid96> @nomenanza Oh I know, they can still be a pain in the ass, though.
[2:56:42] <%primarch_lupercal> two of these guys cause enough chaos LUL
[2:56:43] <Cici_TheMoonRabbit> Corner = Death
[2:56:43] <CappuccinoGuil> nope
[2:56:45] <%kingmemelord97> nope

[2:56:58] <Saffry_Ruzin> @mastertonberry23 I encountered two in the Rip-a-torium
[2:57:00] <peachy996> Luckily I did fine in this room
[2:57:01] <neVan0> sweet baby jesus
[2:57:02] <+Calek> seemed to work out
[2:57:08] <+twohitgood> that enemy just seems annoying. neat as a one-time boss but a chore to have to encounter multiple times.
[2:57:15] <%Dakuu75> gees, talk about a boss fight'n a half
[2:57:16] <+Nomenanza> @MasterTonberry23 the final level iirc but that was just back to back marauders and never a 2v1
[2:57:18] <peachy996> And I didn't even get the 2up
[2:57:20] <%toolofparanoia> forsaken, they are awakened
[2:57:33] <ulcaban> Goddamit, if there's two of them, you should be able to tag in Dante or something

[2:58:42] <+Nomenanza> THAT WAS JUST A WARM UP TO THE REAL FIGHT PAT
[2:58:46] <+tigerfang86> SourPls
[2:58:49] <%kewlmyc> FLOOR IS LIGHTNING
[2:58:51] <%doc_ock_rokc> Did you think they would stop with TWO
[2:58:51] <umbrellaswereawesome> Hilariously enough, a streamer I saw yesterday beat the double Marauder fight in 5 seconds with one BFG blast and a single SSG shot.
[2:58:57] <ulcaban> Pinky?
[2:58:58] <%toolofparanoia> Appetizer done... here comes the main course.
[2:58:58] <%Typhaeon> Doom Eternal (Savage)
[2:59:01] <%AzureGale> The prequel to the sequel
[2:59:06] <%SirKeigan> BFG doesn't work on them
[2:59:13] <%SirKeigan> BFG would be good now
[2:59:13] <umbrellaswereawesome> Apparently Marauder doesn't shield well against another demon exploding from the BFG.
[2:59:15] <+Pyroclase> but the BFG doesn't work on them
[2:59:15] <+Reise04> so this is without Mick right?
[2:59:18] <+Thelovelybison> well doom guy is human, not whatever race the og sentinels are but marauders are corrupted sentinels yeah @kingmemelord97
[2:59:20] <+Calek> bfg works if you time it right
[2:59:23] <ulcaban> RIIIGHT
[2:59:24] <%Anime_Flux> you did it real cool
[2:59:25] <%kingmemelord97> y
[2:59:26] <%doc_ock_rokc> YOUR BFG IS EASY TO KILL
[2:59:28] <%SirKeigan> BFG Good right about now
[2:59:29] <+Pyroclase> @Reise04 yeah, this is Andrew Hulshult
[2:59:30] <%SirKeigan> DO IT
[2:59:31] <Cici_TheMoonRabbit> BFG can work, but it's super tricky.
[2:59:32] <+Thelovelybison> BFG does work but it doesnt hurt them as much as leaves them open
[2:59:33] <umbrellaswereawesome> Actually, you can BFG the Marauder if you SSG them first.
[2:59:33] <%Monkeyweed21> You can do it if you time it right
[2:59:34] <+Nomenanza> I mean, they block BFG. it CAN make them expose their back to you while they block the shot though
[2:59:35] <spawnzie> so many rooms in this where I was like "Surely this is where I'm supposed to BFG" and I was wrong every time
[2:59:37] <MasterTonberry23> @Reise04 no Mick, but they got the guy who did the music for Dusk
[2:59:38] <Onatamana> next you must fight cyber archviles with marauder shields
[2:59:39] <%Typhaeon> Yeah, non-Mick, and you can tell there's a lot more repeititon in the soundtrack
[2:59:44] <+gammerkid96> “Shit, he beat the Marauders! Throw everything we got at him, even the kitchen sink if you have to!”
[2:59:44] <%toolofparanoia> he wanted to Vergil that fight
[3:00:01] <suikudo> POGGERS
[3:00:02] <%Mr_November> Is it weird that I find the two marauders easier than the earlier rooms?
[3:00:03] <+LandOfTheWay> oof
[3:00:09] <%maenos2> deaths - 19
[3:00:09] <suikudo> That would ahve been the fucking end
[3:00:09] <%kingmemelord97> @Thelovelybison i thought the og game conmfired doom guy isnt human anymore
[3:00:10] <KaiserMario> Got greedy
[3:00:13] <neVan0> monkaS
[3:00:14] <%Anime_Flux> if he dies now does he have to do the marauders again?
[3:00:16] <Onatamana> stepped in the fire
[3:00:21] <%SirKeigan> You have more space against the two marauders and they're the only enemies
[3:00:22] <%luftraumm1> that mancubus floor shit really screws you
[3:00:23] <%Typhaeon> It's always, ALWAYS the cyber-mancubuses
[3:00:23] <%SirKeigan> It's not that bad actually
[3:00:25] <+THE_CYB3R_FOX> No
[3:00:29] <%doc_ock_rokc> Cayber mancubuses are kicking pats ass mor ethen the marauders are
[3:00:30] <%Typhaeon> That floor AOE sucks so much
[3:00:31] <chaosbringer28> he does not have to do the mauraders again, it check points right after
[3:00:31] <+l3sovikk> Are you enjoying Doom for big boys?
[3:00:31] <Martiger434> no @Anime_Flux
[3:00:32] <Cici_TheMoonRabbit> @Anime_Flux No
[3:00:34] <GeneralHysterics> not really, marauders are simple when you get the combo down
[3:00:39] <%Anime_Flux> oh thank god
[3:00:39] <BurdRightsActivist> @kingmemelord97 He was, then the dudes saw him and hit him with the makr juice or something
[3:00:40] <+gammerkid96> @anime_flux I think he’s safe... I think.
[3:00:43] <%the22cstomp> @kingmemelord97 he's a demi god so kinda human?
[3:00:43] <gamerform> PogChamp
[3:00:47] <+Nomenanza> pretty much, basically a human who has god juice flowing through his veins @kingmemelord97
[3:00:48] <%maybefalco> this dlc loves cyber-mancubi
[3:00:49] <+Thelovelybison> well he's still mostly human he just got a big buff by seraphim
[3:01:01] <Cici_TheMoonRabbit> The music hasn't even kicked in yet.
[3:01:11] <shutupyouprick> we know who Seraphim is right
[3:01:23] <Teyaric> Yeah but it was like, THE juice the Maykyr were planning to let them subjugate hell? So it's like heaven's own super soldier serum
[3:01:39] <%Mr_November> Even if the track is repetitive, its a cool ass fuckin' beat
[3:01:40] <ulcaban> Seraphim is a giraffe
[3:01:46] <%SirKeigan> Another one
[3:01:56] <%SirKeigan> I bet a Doom Hunter shows up
[3:02:00] <+LandOfTheWay> if i'm remembering right doomguy still has human dna and a discernable blood type, at least according to that one scientist who was splooshin all over him in the main game
[3:02:01] <%mighty_max_t> The seraphim are DmC Dante and Vergil
[3:02:05] <+Nomenanza> anything but the fodder takes 3 iirc
[3:02:05] <%WSintai> ur dum
[3:02:06] <%SilvaChariot0133> who even HAS three fuel?
[3:02:08] <%Typhaeon> Yeah there are too few 2-gas monsters
[3:02:15] <+gammerkid96> @shutupyouprick It’s more obvious than Vergil being Nero’s daddy.
[3:02:15] <+tigerfang86> Y E S

[3:02:33] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Someone was asking for pinkies. Here you go.
[3:02:34] <%Mr_November> Where's the brain?

[3:13:42] <$zyberion626> you got anything better to do?
[3:13:42] <Zebroneath> The next mission is about as long
[3:13:43] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> itsonly 5 hours long patty
[3:13:44] <%wruce__billis> ONE STREAM
[3:13:45] <ulcaban> Five nights at Doomys
[3:13:46] <%Bluwizard21> 5 nights at doom
[3:13:46] <MasterTonberry23> Five nights at Doomguys eh? Eh.
[3:13:46] <%alcors_wisdom> 24 hour stream LETS GGGGGGOOOOOOOOOO
[3:13:46] <%AzureGale> I predict eight nights
[3:13:47] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> This seems like a one level at a time thing.
[3:13:49] <%SirKeigan> Like, 2.5 hours of gameplay for one level
[3:13:51] <Onatamana> But isn't Vega the Father and isn't he a good boy
[3:13:52] <%BoxNavy> five nights at doomys
[3:13:52] <%kingmemelord97> nah you got it in two pat your super streamer
[3:13:53] <+GADtheBAD> ive been playing this on ultra violence
[3:13:54] <+gammerkid96> More like 1/3
[3:13:55] <$ringabal> THIS was the warmup
[3:13:55] <%Jmann9218> Pat just back down and put it on easy
[3:13:55] <%captain_thickthighs> @patstaresat remember at the podcast you said you liked when YouTubers suffer for videos now?
[3:13:56] <%Puhff> yeah the intensity is what ended up driving me away from Doom Eternal
[3:13:56] <GeneralHysterics> no, the dlc is all pain
[3:13:56] <%aishman> Other than Doom Eternal base game?
[3:13:56] <%rumtumtugnutz> Pat you look so defeated
[3:14:00] <DontChuckle98> If it takes 5 nights, get your pal Freddy to play it. :)
[3:14:01] <RantingRavager> @PatStaresAt it took ex-overwatch pro Moonmoon an entire 11+ hour stream to finish the DLC
[3:14:01] <+Pyroclase> I played Taras Nabad first and it relaly helped
[3:14:03] <%DianaTheAscian> is Pat okay?
[3:14:03] <Oxybe> Five Nights at Zangeif's
[3:14:09] <morethantwo> Nice work, Pat! Get some rest.

[3:14:16] <%BoxNavy> ...
[3:14:17] <Aydarkzero> man Pat looks like he's been through Hell Kappa
[3:14:17] <+leviting> this looks like the sort of game where you have to warm up, like, physically

[3:14:26] <Zooperton> pat dead
[3:14:28] <%rumtumtugnutz> Are you actively dying?
[3:14:30] <$ringabal> I can't believe Pat chose to do Ultraviolence
[3:14:30] <chaosbringer28> shits only going to be more intense and wilder from here
[3:14:31] <+Thelovelybison> it took me about 7 hours to beat it on nightmare, it's tough
[3:14:34] <%Monkeyweed21> is that a sex thing
