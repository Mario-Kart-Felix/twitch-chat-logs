[0:01:28] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah pat's not bothering with Ghost of Tsushima because it's too long of a game. especially when it's mostly calm and quiet.
[0:01:34] <abakkus> @DappercatEsquire i woke up at 7:30 to the emergency tone and then slept til 2pm oops. it didnt hit us too bad here.
[0:01:38] <@SoFarFetched> So he only did the two streams and has been playing the rest on his own time.

[0:26:40] <%Dingalow> That Beirut explosion is fucked, man
[0:26:42] <%ragingbrachy> SourPls
[0:26:42] <+Donchalant402> @majima666 yeah they kept an old stockpile of ammonium nitrate next to a warehouse filled with fireworks
[0:26:45] <%CommanderSqueaks> Baby is currently doing the big poo, probably.
[0:26:46] <%TheotherKristian> FALL Guy is available woth your PS Plus account
[0:26:46] <%DesertPenguin> If Paige is sleeping then Pat's the only one to take care of dog AND do stream? Uh oh....
[0:26:47] <Kain5707> i dont think he realizes how much of a commitment a baby is
[0:26:48] <mastermidget23> After all the tension and buildup with Zangief, Pat shit his pants.
[0:26:49] <+Donchalant402> the results are as expected
[0:26:52] <estacado262> Fall guys is okay
[0:27:02] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Donchalant402 Cannot tell if shitpost or truth
[0:27:05] <%DesertPenguin> Anyone with PS+ can download Fall Guys. It's basically MXC from back in the day
[0:27:08] <Vitoria90> If you want to read about a historical event similar to this Beirut accident, look up the Halifax Explosion of 1917
[0:27:17] <%joylent_blue> Fall guys is super fun that's for sure
[0:27:17] <%vibe__lord> Pat Definetly just shit his pants on stream
[0:27:23] <Vitoria90> a ship full of ammo bound to the Western Front of WWI exploded the whole harbor
[0:27:29] <%joylent_blue> especially when the griefing starts pvpSK
[0:27:38] <+Donchalant402> @CommanderSqueaks legit unfortunately, they knew about this for about half a year that it was ready to explode at any moment and they did nothing
[0:27:40] <+GuilKato> Pat may need to picture in picture a second camera stream. watching Zangief sleep if he's a sleepy puppy
[0:27:45] <%CommanderSqueaks> Hey remember when Pat said Peach would have enough time to shower before Zangief awoke? psaCrazyhead psaCrazyhand
[0:27:56] <estacado262> Baby shit pats pants
[0:27:56] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Donchalant402 ...... -Heavy Sigh-

[0:33:39] <RichochetForce> @estacado262 Unfortunately, this. Dogs are ridiculously attuned to people.

[0:36:24] <%ragingbrachy> la bomba
[0:36:25] <@SoFarFetched> If you don't know if what you said was assholish or creepy,we got a problem.
[0:36:43] <@SoFarFetched> Cause nothings worse than "I dont know what I said but Im sorrry for whatever"
[0:36:48] <%Loinclothiclese> @lunaraci big
[0:36:53] <%ragingbrachy> ^
[0:36:54] <cipher758> guess being a decent person is overrated
[0:36:56] <phantomsleeves> honestly he made it weirder the more he went on
[0:36:57] <%Chichen> yep farfetched
[0:37:01] <%maskofmichael> Don't fuck up, dogs are watching
[0:37:01] <estacado262> What just happened lol
[0:37:03] <%CzeekyPlays> @SoFarFetched "I learned nothing but that's not my problem"
[0:37:03] <%argavus> have i ever tld you the definition of insanity?
[0:37:14] <%Dingalow> Man, I adore this kinda game
[0:37:14] <@SoFarFetched> Someone made a stalkerish creepy comment.
[0:37:15] <%tigerfang86> @SoFarFetched I guess I'll ALLOW myself to be owned I SUPPOSE
[0:37:19] <%CommanderSqueaks> "Hey I'm being kind of creepy and making people uncomfortable, should I back off or DOUBLE DOWN?"
[0:37:20] <+DoktorZee> u got this!
[0:37:20] <SolsticeZro> yo I watched the last vod of this, this game is crazy
[0:37:21] <%Chichen> People with no self reflection scare me
[0:37:23] <%lunaraci> Well thats always fun when it happens
[0:37:25] <%ragingbrachy> nah your fine
[0:37:28] <CursedNobleman> LUL
[0:37:28] <BallerSwagBro9k> Yeah this game has a rhythm
[0:37:32] <+DoktorZee> abuse that slowtime!
[0:37:33] <%DappercatEsquire> @PatStaresAt You played better almost falling asleep
[0:37:34] <%DedlokPM> @lunaraci speculating on what car they have and wondering if "people who live in montreal will be looking for a red head driving" it
[0:37:36] <%za7az> To be fair, you were really tired
[0:37:39] <%tigerfang86> game just seems hard tbh
[0:37:47] <estacado262> Ewwww get fuckt then
[0:37:51] <%tigerfang86> that's pat's secret
[0:37:51] <%ragingbrachy> it is a hard game
[0:37:51] <Aydarkzero> splat
[0:37:52] <Ikazix> The dev did say he was working on more content for this game, we should get some eventually.
[0:37:52] <$JamJamX3> I wonder how Pat would enjoy Hotline Miami, assuming he hadn't played it already. :o
[0:37:53] <%Starotter70> psaDab
[0:37:54] <%joylent_blue> so its perfect!
[0:37:54] <%tigerfang86> he's always tired
[0:37:54] <nomolomo> thats my secret, im always sleeping
[0:37:56] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> @DappercatEsquire sure, but it's harder now than before lol
[0:37:59] <%Typhaeon> He's the Hulk but lazy
[0:37:59] <%za7az> lol
[0:38:01] <CursedNobleman> not using timeslow isnt helping
[0:38:01] <Maleicus> ha
[0:38:02] <RichochetForce> Nah, this is where the game gets REAL
[0:38:02] <%skizzuto> you are at the hard part of the game
[0:38:04] <%CommanderSqueaks> This stream got off to a strange start, everyone can understand if your rhythm is a bit off.
[0:38:04] <+meatmaaan> always almost asleep
[0:38:06] <kikoeru_san> oh man Pat is at meat grinder
[0:38:07] <%Starotter70> It's tough towards the end
[0:38:08] <BallerSwagBro9k> Nah this game is ez. I got stuck long on only 1 room
[0:38:10] <cureneckbeard> That's my secret. I'm always asleep.
[0:38:11] <%Typhaeon> (well, tired but lazy is funnier)
[0:38:13] <%ragingbrachy> use the slowdown if you think you need it (you coward)
[0:38:13] <%Dingalow> Man, this game pure goes in on you straight away, from the looks of things
[0:38:13] <%skizzuto> everything post chinatown required me to bash my head against it a ton
[0:38:18] <%DappercatEsquire> @SaltkeyAndAckfish a likely excuse! nah you right
[0:38:18] <%JD_Lars> Sometimes it works like that. Brain get stumbo focused somehow
[0:38:19] <kikoeru_san> and he woke up Leon
[0:38:20] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> random fun fact: watching Muholland Drive while super tired is the best way to watch it
[0:38:21] <+EySoyCoco> he gonna do an ng+ run for blasphemous? cool
[0:38:22] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Yeah the games difficulty really gets going this level onward
[0:38:22] <dukenux> psaSleep
[0:38:24] <wibbwobbler> just dont get hit
[0:38:36] <SolsticeZro> 4Head
[0:38:45] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Chester_goes_Berserk How were the fever-dream-esque nightmares you inevitably had?
[0:38:46] <kikoeru_san> this ain't too bad, hard mode in this game is absolutely fucked
[0:38:47] <BallerSwagBro9k> Just Git Gud :)
[0:38:47] <HarmlessCrow> Honestly this level gave me so many headaches
[0:38:57] <+meatmaaan> this place is a gauntlet tbf
[0:39:05] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> @DappercatEsquire nothing to see here, just moving my troops next to your borders
[0:39:06] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[0:39:12] <Ikazix> Hard mode goes full IWTBG, but it's recommend atlest trying it once or twice.
[0:39:13] <%joylent_blue> they were READY
[0:39:15] <%UvBenServed> psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead
[0:39:19] <%Dingalow> Going from this to the more slower paced Blasphemous will be fascinating to watch
[0:39:23] <%elicoy> This seems incredibly fun and frustrating at the same time
[0:39:25] <CursedNobleman> NotLikeThis imagine not using bullettime mechanics
[0:39:25] <BallerSwagBro9k> Welp so much for Blasphemous tonight LUL
[0:39:26] <uncledoodsauce> pat has already forgotten his ghost of tsushima skills Kappa

[0:52:31] <Vashido22> you dodge the cameras
[0:52:33] <Xelgus> stay on the ground
[0:52:33] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> I dont think it works in a normal run tho
[0:52:34] <+aWanderingKaivo> there is always speedrun tech
[0:52:34] <%ragingbrachy> its not speedrun tech but yeah
[0:52:36] <CursedNobleman> iron maiden but whenever you hear a gunshot the lazers speed up

[0:53:14] <SomeAsianDood> there's motion sensors in the tv rooms. Look at the roof. You can dodge them @Donchalant402
[0:53:16] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> And cameras you can roll past
[0:53:19] <%ScottishMadJacko> how is he doing that without slo2m9

[1:20:26] <Vashido22> I'm way too used to it
[1:20:29] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> V and Snow are good enough to kill people with actual king crimson tech

[1:20:40] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Youre right
[1:20:41] <+Jaysky> That also had a bunch of flower petals up her cooter for incidental use?

[2:10:56] <%skizzuto> I think so
[2:10:57] <megaminimechamocha> I was pretty sure I knew
[2:10:58] <+QuadraticGravity> I'd wait until the text appears of him scolding you, to be sure
[2:10:59] <dinnydanny777> If can has then go?
[2:11:00] <+Castle_Kundarak> Try it?
[2:11:06] <%DappercatEsquire> PrideShrug

[2:11:46] <%ScottishMadJacko> where does the difference start between regular scene and secret?

[2:12:07] <%Daskolin> Found it
[2:12:11] <SomeAsianDood> Maybe you didn't refuse drugs at DJ?
[2:12:13] <+TehBeerBaron> One of the steps requires you to not interrupt the psych
[2:12:18] <dinnydanny777> This music is pretty nice

[2:13:59] <narusao> patlogic FailFish
[2:14:01] <devilmanjay> chat confirmed liara
[2:14:04] <megaminimechamocha> Chat the Liar stole Pat's stream time

[2:14:23] <ha2ken> Don't lie to Pat...it will make Woolie stronger.
[2:14:26] <@StridentSong> Pat you were supposed to say Hello during the call.
[2:14:30] <Jetsfantasy> @FutaSnek I've had a couple one guy moments in other streams, sometimes it's legit not remembering things correctly
[2:14:35] <0rond> DA CAT THO
[2:14:36] <%Piemono> 100% of the time, there's someone wrong in Chat
[2:14:40] <devilmanjay> chat tells streamer what to do ha
[2:14:41] <%GabeSweetMan> lmao
[2:14:49] <@SoFarFetched> no shut up
[2:14:50] <@SoFarFetched> its fine
[2:14:53] <iosephe> It's a secret
[2:14:54] <ManfredA> it's just relationship values
[2:14:56] <%CommanderSqueaks> "Why does video game make me do what it tells me to do.:"
[2:14:59] <ScatterCatt> Where's da baby?
[2:14:59] <+TheOneCalledRock> because fuck you that's why OpieOP
[2:15:02] <%Mendin> He got the achievement for the hangups he's fine
[2:15:03] <%GabeSweetMan> psa1guy disagrees that psa1guy is wrong about psa1guy .
[2:15:04] <devilmanjay> because chat playing you
[2:15:05] <marvel877> if it was easy, it wouldn't be a secret then.
[2:15:06] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> maximum dickery required
[2:15:09] <devilmanjay> like a fiddle
[2:15:09] <+QuadraticGravity> You're the first person I've seen have so much issue getting it to pop
[2:15:09] <BallerSwagBro9k> This seems pointless
[2:15:10] <Daxalog> Probably for 2nd playthroughs
[2:15:18] <R3Roundabout> Why is the hidden boss hidden?
[2:15:18] <%DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt its called a SECRET boss Pat
[2:15:22] <FutaSnek> @Jetsfantasy Usually if I'm not sure what the answer is I wont answer, not spew something incorrect out with 100% assurance
[2:15:24] <%Dr_DangerPhD> "why is this secret boss so hard to find?"
[2:15:31] <%juxtest> Stomp on your right foot DONT FORGET IT
[2:15:32] <megaminimechamocha> Honestly I don't remember facing the secret boss being this difficult.
[2:15:33] <%CommanderSqueaks> "Secrets shouldn't be too secret."
[2:15:34] <dinnydanny777> Have you tried circle X circle X up down left right r1 l1 l2 r2, spinning on the spot three times and pressing start and select at the same time while holding down both analog sticks?
[2:15:37] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> ?????
[2:15:40] <%DappercatEsquire> How did they figure out the necessary steps for the secret boss to being with? That's always the more interesting story to me.
[2:15:44] <megaminimechamocha> I think Pat is just Crazy Talking Katana Zero
[2:15:48] <%CommanderSqueaks> Mushi mushi?
[2:15:55] <KeiPrime> JERRY
[2:16:00] <dinnydanny777> Press Alt F4 for a secret ending
[2:16:00] <%Shwepie> @FutaSnek Sadly a lot of chat is the exact opposite of that.
[2:16:00] <ManfredA> it's worth it
[2:16:04] <+QuadraticGravity> @DappercatEsquire It's not super difficult, you just take every opportunity to piss him off
[2:16:07] <+Donchalant402> cat
[2:16:07] <Jetsfantasy> @FutaSnek I totally agree, but one of my moments I was completely sure of myself
[2:16:08] <RichochetForce> Katana FOREVER
[2:16:10] <@SoFarFetched> Pat should have played smarter Kappa
[2:16:11] <Sol_Install> it's worth it yea
[2:16:17] <Rafikator> @PatStaresAt You need to be an absolute asshole to get this ending tbh
[2:16:20] <%ClericOfSparda> Pat just flip to Blasphemous
[2:16:22] <megaminimechamocha> Blasphemous, another over-produced bad game.
[2:16:27] <%CommanderSqueaks> @SoFarFetched How dare you imply that any of this is Pat's fault.
[2:16:35] <+Donchalant402> @Rafikator so its the perfect end for pat?
[2:16:45] <%za7az> The boss is worth it
[2:16:46] <dinnydanny777> Over produced???
[2:16:46] <Rafikator> Bruh

[2:16:52] <%Daskolin> Its da one guy
[2:16:53] <%DappercatEsquire> @QuadraticGravity I was speaking more generally, but consistently being an asshole in this game seems like an easy way to discover it.
[2:16:56] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat has successfully taken the bait.
[2:16:58] <FutaSnek> That guy has been super negative this whole time LUL
[2:16:59] <RichochetForce> Some peopel TRIPPING over their dick

[2:17:31] <%Piemono> How quick someone goes from calling it over produced to "okay" after getting called out
[2:17:33] <@SoFarFetched> I can't believe there are 20 blasphemous games we didn't know about.
[2:17:37] <%sockybalboa> A spicy take indeed.
[2:17:38] <%Maids4lyfe> psa1guy
[2:17:41] <+QuadraticGravity> You know the point of bait is that your dumb asses aren't supposed to acknowledge it
[2:17:42] <+Jaysky> Man, Hollow Knight is just a glorified demo for Silksong :)
[2:17:49] <+Donchalant402> CYKA
[2:17:50] <+TheOneCalledRock> @DianaTheAscian yeah the same guy who screamed the cops were in the cells OpieOP

[2:18:17] <+TheOneCalledRock> @megaminimechamocha that does not make your stance any better dude LUL
[2:18:18] <%holydeviant1> You can stop throwing the whole rod in the water man

[2:18:40] <sir_foxwood> I think so?
[2:18:41] <%Spydurman> but Baba is Secret Ending
[2:18:43] <+QuadraticGravity> What if you stop redtexting during this segment
[2:18:45] <%GabeSweetMan> @Jaysky You say that, but if Silksong becomes like... the biggest game ever then people might ACTUALLY look back on Hollow Knight as being one.

[2:20:10] <+slimmixrp> We can youtube the boss
[2:20:12] <kingra> Dang this boss is good but GODDAMN
[2:20:12] <+xeros720> the secret is to play blasphemous
[2:20:13] <devilmanjay> yup
[2:20:13] <%velemi> just look it up
[2:20:14] <+QuadraticGravity> just quit mashing the red options man q-q
[2:20:14] <heartlesshealer> So hey, Daskolin's instructions mention not using red dialogues at one point. So if you're following those...
[2:20:14] <dinnydanny777> We haven't even lost to the secret boss yet
[2:20:15] <%AncelDeLambert> you only NOW came to that realization?
[2:20:16] <%ScottishMadJacko> @stridentsong in a row? really? wow
[2:20:16] <%AyotoCorp> @PatStaresAt You don't need to do the steps in order
[2:20:18] <+TAFK> @PatStaresAt - If you’ve done all the steps up to this point, you can see if you’re on the way to the hidden boss by going to the psychiatrist session in Bunker. During this session the psychiatrist will tell you something different. He will say, “I’m almost disappointed that you’re still alive, after what you’ve put me through.” If get this dialogue it means you will have unlocked the boss fight.
[2:20:19] <LordOfThePoultry> it is worth it
[2:20:19] <+Donchalant402> aww dang
[2:20:20] <FutaSnek> I was gonna say its cool but not that cool LUL
[2:20:20] <+xeros720> the reward is you get to play blasphemous
[2:20:21] <sir_foxwood> When the psychiatrist said something about being disappointed that you survived, then that means you did it
[2:20:21] <%cvp5127> kay
[2:20:22] <%miguelrod777> nope
[2:20:23] <%Spydurman> find a video online and show us
[2:20:23] <dan_g_v> don't listen to chat, watch a youtube guide
[2:20:25] <rosemon5001> literally could youtube it but fuck it
[2:20:27] <0rond> it's super worth it but i understand why you'd do it
[2:20:28] <dinnydanny777> We literally didn't even lose to the boss once
[2:20:30] <+PleasantLee> I think you need to interrupt him and ask him for medicine
[2:20:34] <jorniev> IT REALLY ISN'T
[2:20:35] <%ScottishMadJacko> we getting conflicting info
[2:20:35] <%ClericOfSparda> It's all good Pat, Secret bosses are BS
[2:20:37] <%GabeSweetMan> The steps are *too* specific and esoteric. This is Cave Story shit.
[2:20:38] <%maskofmichael> Just look it up on youtube
[2:20:40] <heartlesshealer> Bunker and not Bunker 2?
[2:20:42] <devilmanjay> its too late
[2:20:43] <%sockybalboa> LUL LUL
[2:20:47] <+QuadraticGravity> You're missing tons of dialogue options by mashing red text
[2:20:48] <%ScottishMadJacko> not your fault, its ours
[2:20:48] <+ShinBojangles> Anyone else here waiting for fall guys to work?
[2:20:49] <nomolomo> too bad, next bit
[2:20:49] <Rafikator> @PatStaresAt Wartch it on youtube
[2:20:49] <+Donchalant402> yeah you skipped the bunker step
[2:20:49] <jorniev> WHAT
[2:20:50] <heartlesshealer> yeah, jut youtube it
[2:20:56] <%holydeviant1> 2late\
[2:20:56] <%CommanderSqueaks> I mean, you've basically got to do everything in your power to piss off the therapist @QuadraticGravity
[2:21:01] <FutaSnek> OH DOES HE HAVE TO OPEN THESE \
[2:21:04] <ManfredA> the bunker step is optional
[2:21:09] <dinnydanny777> So if we reached the boss fight would we even win?
[2:21:10] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Sick
[2:21:11] <+ConLin_Arts_> LUL
[2:21:12] <%GabeSweetMan> WHAT?!
[2:21:14] <$Afterman_> links sword
[2:21:18] <+PleasantLee> yeah I think you havent interrupted the psychiatrist for medicine
[2:21:19] <heartlesshealer> master sword, rainbow sword
[2:21:20] <WhatzePh> @GabeSweetMan Try getting true ending in Steins Gate. Now that's esoteric.
[2:21:21] <$Afterman_> sword of masters, master sword
[2:21:27] <%Mendin> Wait does that actually do
[2:21:28] <+QuadraticGravity> @CommanderSqueaks I'm actually convinced that he already opened it and just keeps mashing through the right option
[2:21:32] <%Aeoneth> I like that the icon for it was 3 squares
[2:21:32] <bleugh> i know that reference nyannPOG
[2:21:32] <SomersaultJustice> LUL
[2:21:34] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Rainbow sword best sword
[2:21:38] <%DappercatEsquire> dog break?
[2:21:41] <dinnydanny777> What game has the most esoteric endings
[2:21:42] <%CommanderSqueaks> @QuadraticGravity I don't even know anymore
[2:21:45] <0rond> @PatStaresAt be sure to watch that boss on youtube tho
[2:21:46] <%AngriestAngryArtist> kaeitana
[2:21:46] <megaminimechamocha> Okay enjoy bad dark souls 2
[2:21:46] <heartlesshealer> not better, but still alright
[2:21:47] <theloganbrand> I hear it's 'overproduced'
[2:21:48] <%Starotter70> psaUp
[2:21:49] <+TehBeerBaron> yeah, buy the game and find it!
[2:21:49] <smuggleruncle> kay tana LUL
[2:21:55] <%GabeSweetMan> @WhatzePh From watching the Anime, I can believe that.
[2:21:56] <+xeros720> less annoying secrets
[2:21:56] <%CommanderSqueaks> @dinnydanny777 Cave Story is pretty bad.
[2:21:57] <SummonerMagno> larrAnimeleft larrAnimeright
[2:22:02] <%chiluzza> where pup??
[2:22:08] <+ShinBojangles> Did Pat never play Blasphemous? Was it all a dream I imagined?
[2:22:09] <%AngriestAngryArtist> patana
[2:22:10] <%chiluzza> WHERE PUP
[2:22:10] <%SaiyanShoto> We'll make our own Katana Zero stream! With blackjack and hookers
[2:22:14] <%Starotter70> psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhand
[2:22:17] <ManfredA> it's not that bad to find it's just probably one little thing tripping him up
[2:22:18] <@SoFarFetched> Pat played it,he's doing the new DLC for it.
[2:22:21] <heartlesshealer> someone talking shit on cave story???
[2:22:23] <%CommanderSqueaks> Like I cannot see anyone ACCIDENTALLY stumbling over Cave Story's secret boss.
[2:22:23] <+TheOneCalledRock> OH
[2:22:25] <jorniev> I DID NOT EVEN LIKE THAT SECRET BOSS
[2:22:29] <+TheOneCalledRock> i remember having the same issue
[2:22:34] <megaminimechamocha> Awww he added Zangief that's so cute!
[2:22:35] <+TheOneCalledRock> and i remember how i solved it!
[2:22:40] <heartlesshealer> OH
[2:22:40] <%CommanderSqueaks> @heartlesshealer The game is great, the things you have to do to get to the secret boss is obtuse as shit.
[2:22:43] <zDepp> Say "Fuck you" to the therapist on Mission 7
[2:22:43] <heartlesshealer> The hell section
[2:22:48] <+ShinBojangles> Theres Blasphemous DLC????
[2:22:49] <tanarath> did the kaytana zero dlc drop?
[2:22:59] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah Blasphemous DLC came out recently
[2:23:03] <%CommanderSqueaks> @heartlesshealer No, not the level, the flags you have to trigger to unlock that
[2:23:03] <estacado262> Zanny
[2:23:08] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Blasphemous DLC just came out today
[2:23:09] <FutaSnek> I'm exited too see this DLC
[2:23:11] <heartlesshealer> @CommanderSqueaks no yeah, I understand now if we're talking about that part
[2:23:19] <+TheOneCalledRock> after killing all the police you have to trigger the dialog with the phycastrist
[2:23:21] <+ShinBojangles> Oh shit gotta jump on that! Loved the base game.
[2:23:36] <+TheOneCalledRock> i remember do that then i got the secret boss to trigger LUL
[2:23:40] <+TheOneCalledRock> it was really fucking stupid
[2:23:40] <WhatzePh> If you have the GOG version, you'll have to wait undefined amount of time though.
[2:23:44] <ShinobiPhoenix> I feel like Pat might not have told the Psych "fuck" during the Therapy session in Chinatown
[2:23:46] <megaminimechamocha> I hope the Blasphemous DLC isn't ponderous and tedious like the entire rest of the game was.
[2:23:59] <heartlesshealer> @CommanderSqueaks Yeah, my friend had to tell me how to save Curly because I couldn't figure out how the first time around
[2:24:02] <+rottingpastry> There are multiple guides it's fine he doesn't wanna
[2:24:05] <zDepp> the good thing about the dlc is its is free
[2:24:08] <dinnydanny777> What's that one guy got against Blasphemous anyway
[2:24:10] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Ya know, I'm probably just going to play through the Blasphemous DLC stuff on my own, so y'all have a nice evening
[2:24:13] <FutaSnek> @megaminimechamocha Dude we get it you didn't like it
[2:24:16] <+TheOneCalledRock> no it's fine if he dosn't want to
[2:24:22] <%barkon345> wow I just watched how your supposed to do it. on the first mission your supposed to hang up on him immediately all but 2 times. the first time your supposed to let it go past the red part and then hang up on him then the the next call answer him.
[2:24:34] <%CommanderSqueaks> @dinnydanny777 He's a troll that has been successfully baiting Pat and most of chat for the last hour.
[2:24:37] <+TheOneCalledRock> i just remember how that the issue was caused by a very specific problem
[2:24:49] <%Daniel_Is_I> We get it, you don't like Blasphemous and want everyone to know it. Good for you.
[2:24:49] <%orphan_ash> sheesh the secret boss looks pretty awesome, just saw a vid
[2:25:00] <megaminimechamocha> @FutaSnek I mean at this point I'm just addicted to the salt, I'll go do something else and get it out of my system now lol
[2:25:05] <%ScottishMadJacko> eh, I'm sure the secret boss wasn't worth the frustration
[2:25:07] <dinnydanny777> Is the secret boss Julius
[2:25:08] <%CommanderSqueaks> They're not going to stop until you people stop taking the bait.
[2:25:18] <+cafefunk> How long have they had Zangief
[2:25:23] <+ShinBojangles> Did pat get a dog? Haven't been here in a few weeks.
[2:25:28] <%CommanderSqueaks> 2 weeks?...
[2:25:30] <%CommanderSqueaks> I thnk?
[2:25:30] <%za7az> @ScottishMadJacko It really is worth it though...
[2:25:30] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah he got the dog on Friday.
[2:25:32] <%Maids4lyfe> yes
[2:25:34] <@SoFarFetched> well sorryt not got
[2:25:36] <estacado262> PJSalt PJSalt PJSalt PJSalt PJSalt
[2:25:36] <@SoFarFetched> *announced* on friday
[2:25:41] <ShinobiPhoenix> also, maybe it's impossible to get the secret boss if your prison level already wants you to kill all the cops, as opposed to the version where you're supposed to stealth and NOT kill the cops, which pisses off the psych
[2:25:48] <megaminimechamocha> Incidentally I assume Pat would have been frustrated by the Katana Zero secret boss, it gets pretty tedious too.
[2:25:49] <@SoFarFetched> during the other Katana Zero Stream.
[2:25:53] <%CommanderSqueaks> Peach gave birth to Zangief on Thursday.
[2:25:53] <jorniev> did the katana zero devs say anything about a sequel?
[2:25:53] <%orphan_ash> guys you should block that annoying person.
[2:25:56] <heartlesshealer> @ShinBojangles check out pat's youtube channel, there's a couple videos of puppy
[2:25:59] <%ScottishMadJacko> @za7az for us maybe, but pat was getting annoyed there
[2:25:59] <%CalderGaming> just joined. is blasphemous up next, or more katana?
[2:26:00] <dan_g_v> isnthere an option for spaniard dub in blasphemous? the blasphemy must be enjoyed. in its original. language
[2:26:07] <%CommanderSqueaks> @jorniev Yes
[2:26:09] <ShinobiPhoenix> Pat's version wanted him to kill all the cops, not AVOID killing all the cops
[2:26:14] <dan_g_v> blasphy
[2:26:14] <+ShinBojangles> @heartlesshealer will do thx
[2:26:14] <+cafefunk> Is Zangief getting along with Elmo
[2:26:23] <FutaSnek> Simon from DP said it best "How could you possibly enjoy anything when your so busy putting people down, your like IBS, you always flare up at the worst times and theres no end in sight.
[2:26:29] <%CommanderSqueaks> Apparently Zangief barely knows Elmo exists.
[2:26:32] <%FusRoDom> Why make it such a weird set of steps to do that. I feel like if you need a guide it makes it less fun to get to. Like how are you supposed to figure that out on your own?
[2:26:33] <estacado262> BibleThump
[2:26:43] <+ShinBojangles> Has Elmo taken in zangief as his apprentice?
[2:26:46] <%ScottishMadJacko> Good call on blocking that guy chat
[2:26:50] <%za7az> @ScottishMadJacko I consider it one of the best bosses in videogames, period. So I have to disagree on that one
[2:27:04] <FutaSnek> Zangief preforms Final Atomic Buster when?
[2:27:04] <+rottingpastry> The steps are literally "piss of the psychiatrist" they're not exactly super secret.
[2:27:05] <+TheOneCalledRock> it's a really good boss
[2:27:22] <@SoFarFetched> Honestly it's best to ignore when certain people talk a specific way about things. Because then it just ends up being a talk that just goes around in circles until someone decides to stop engaging.
[2:27:22] <afronooch> on one hand, fuck tedious steps. on the other it is a secret boss
[2:27:27] <Kain5707> what was his name again?
[2:27:48] <%FusRoDom> Okay gotcha, it just sounded a lot more complicated as people were reading off the steps individually
[2:27:51] <%ScottishMadJacko> @za7az personally if getting it pisses me off, then I probably won't enjoy it out of spite but that's just me I think
[2:28:01] <%Paralurx> Paralurx subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 28 months, currently on a 28 month streak! Jesus Christ over 2 years of this shit. Guess I'm in too deep to quite subbing now. Pet da baby. And da other baby. And da other other baby.
[2:28:21] <+TheOneCalledRock> its complicated because there is specific situations that the guides do not mention that's easy to over look
[2:28:22] <%FacetiousAF> changing gears from ninja man blade runner to spanish catholic metal souls
[2:28:40] <@SoFarFetched> No one expects the Spanish Inquisition.
[2:28:45] <+slimmixrp> A lot of shit lords in here today between that dickbag and the stalker guy and the really insensitive Iwata message from that one dude
[2:28:49] <%ScottishMadJacko> the guides miss steps? that's a terrible guide
[2:28:50] <estacado262> Sekiro secret bosses are easy to get at least
[2:29:01] <%za7az> @ScottishMadJacko That's the funny part, because unlocking it pissed me off too, but it was just too well designed and cool to stay mad at lol
[2:29:05] <FutaSnek> @SoFarFetched I've found most people who that overtly negative will burn themselves out pretty quick as well. But not engaging def helps
[2:29:06] <Kain5707> LUL good old monty python

[2:30:56] <ShinobiPhoenix> @PatStaresAt I think you couldn't get the secret boss because your run of the game WANTED you to kill all the cops, as opposed to avoid killing them and stealth out of the Prison, where killing them pissing off the Psych

[2:55:50] <%Mendin> psaBig Stumbo
[2:55:52] <+ShinBojangles> "I'm gonna walk slowly at you with this knife, if you walk into it its your own fault"
[2:55:59] <FutaSnek> @ScottishMadJacko For example the bones of saints become power ups after they die and are highly saught after by people in the church LUL
[2:56:02] <%Mendin> It's your DS Rings analogues
[2:56:05] <%DianaTheAscian> his junk is covered in rope

[2:56:38] <Pookiedaexzile> Whose this asshole in Zangiefs Seat
[2:56:58] <dinnydanny777> I like how all these things have so much lore to them but because this is a game we're just going "dodge distance"
[2:57:04] <%ScottishMadJacko> Oh sick, religious power ups, lemme just crunch this old man bone i guess @FutaSnek LUL
[2:57:09] <FutaSnek> Its Zangief's personal trainer he lets him use his setup for free seshions
[2:57:26] <%Dakuu75> knowing this game, that guy probably wrapped his junk in bramble spikes and itching powder before the rope
[2:57:34] <Pookiedaexzile> @FutaSnek How generous

[3:04:08] <%Mendin> The DLC is ng+
[3:04:11] <MassConnect> this makes me wonder: if you had to choose, would you rather keep upgrades or keep the map?
[3:04:11] <dukenux> the DLC is said to include NewGame+

[3:13:44] <BallerSwagBro9k> Pat Fails At
[3:13:47] <%arcielardor> @pat, you're gonna get stuck if you keep going this way. you were supposed to go right from the doctor church.
[3:13:49] <%Skelegroove> You have to find Jibrael in several other locations to get the bosses
[3:14:04] <%CommanderSqueaks> God did some brand image management between Testaments.
[3:14:08] <%Mendin> @arcielardor wrong
[3:14:20] <bashful_bard> Does that slide have a cd or is it just free damage?
[3:14:42] <%Mendin> The slide-stab has a slight cooldown and needs a minimum range to execute
[3:14:44] <%DappercatEsquire> fuck it back to Katana Zero
[3:14:46] <WhatzePh> @arcielardor You can go any of the three ways.
[3:14:47] <%CommanderSqueaks> Couldn't you look up a guide?
[3:14:48] <chambatron> snped
[3:14:48] <dinnydanny777> Isn't there a part of the bible that explains God has the Angel's because hearing him speak to human beings would cause them to die horribly, like he's some kind of Eldritch Being
[3:14:48] <WeebFever> You managed to see face chest man-baby
[3:14:52] <%saadi90> thus is life

[3:15:18] <%CommanderSqueaks> @dinnydanny777 Yes, at one point he decides to show his back to a mountain to demonstrate and it basically glasses the fucking thing.

[3:16:14] <%MelBrooksKA> Oh thank god, my AC is back on
[3:16:35] <%CommanderSqueaks> @dinnydanny777 Looking at him basically forces a penance stare, and because of the original sin, every human's soul would immediately immolate. That's the gist.
[3:16:36] <BallerSwagBro9k> @dinnydanny777 Hearing his voice or seeing his face would kill you according to the bible
[3:16:45] <+hax_metatron> What a disappointing decision to gate DLC behind NG+. Lost a lot of favor with me for this. :/
[3:16:52] <@SoFarFetched> @MelBrooksKA have you become fully revived from the AC sipsipDab
[3:17:00] <WhatzePh> I feel like their attack rate was reduced, no?

[3:17:29] <MelBrooksKA> @SoFarFetched It's gonna take a while till a full revive

[3:18:39] <+RowenCleric> they fixed the spikes glitch didnt they
[3:18:45] <BallerSwagBro9k> BONFIRE
[3:18:58] <+stickygumbolee> Is the boss in the DLC just 8-bit Gwyn?
[3:19:00] <trfurkanrey18> @SoFarFetched coo it with the puns bro Kappa
[3:19:04] <trfurkanrey18> cool* fuck
[3:19:10] <%CommanderSqueaks> That's the whole concept of the Ark of the Covenant, the idea is that it's so holy that only the holiest of high priest, after spending about a day purifying themselves, can even look upon it, everyone else just melts (which if the Nazi's READ the old testament in Indiana Jones, would have known that, the dummies.)
[3:19:16] <BallerSwagBro9k> Dayum
[3:19:19] <@SoFarFetched> I see someone lost their cool psaWink
[3:19:28] <saito47> The slide does a ridiculous amount of damage and was the only real way i found myself killing dues in ng+
[3:19:36] <dinnydanny777> But when do we get to the Jesus Christ boss fight
[3:19:40] <bashful_bard> Slaughter your foe in god's name
[3:19:53] <%CommanderSqueaks> I mean, Jesus was pretty much the first boss in this game.
[3:20:01] <@SoFarFetched> And Jesus is also a JoJo
[3:20:08] <@SoFarFetched> the first one
[3:20:16] <@SoFarFetched> psaMenace psaMenace
[3:20:19] <dukenux> You also fight Baby Jesus in this
[3:20:19] <%Skelegroove> Seems like you want to go to the Convent of Our Lady of the Charred Visage. Seems like the most easily accessed of the new bosses
[3:20:20] <trfurkanrey18> nah we cool man Kappa @SoFarFetched
[3:20:27] <dinnydanny777> I still can't believe that part where Moses used a Beyblade to part the Red Sea
[3:20:28] <@SoFarFetched> psaDab
[3:20:38] <%CommanderSqueaks> Also, Jesus would make the majority of this penance irrelevant because the idea is he takes all of mankind's sins upon himself. So this game literally couldn't exist if that was the case.
[3:20:42] <%DappercatEsquire> YOU'RE FAVORITE ENEMY
[3:20:44] <%arcaderabbit48> What all did the DLC add?
[3:20:44] <+hax_metatron> Here you got this really cool game and a great way to solidify your fanbase with extra content they’ve been waiting for (I adore the art style and music of this game).... what would possess them to go after difficulty boners and restrict DLC to NG+? So disappointing.

[3:21:28] <Ner234> @someyounguy1 New DLC. This is NG+
[3:21:33] <dukenux> no. this is more old testament god marred with old catholic ritualism
[3:21:48] <BallerSwagBro9k> There's also this one part in the bible where the Ark is being transported to a city on a cart. The cart almost topples over so some guy tries to grab the ark to prevent it from falling and God strikes him dead cuz no one is allowed to touch it.
[3:21:55] <+someyounguy1> @Ner234 oh i see. that makes much more sense as to why he had the seed relic. ty

[3:24:53] <%CommanderSqueaks> @dmtjinni Start every new enemy encounter with parries and dodges until you learn the patterns.
[3:24:54] <Jaghatai> This a first time playthrough or NG+?
[3:25:01] <%Skelegroove> There is a dlc area connected to Jondo here
[3:25:16] <BallerSwagBro9k> AFTER 84 YEARS
[3:25:21] <%Skelegroove> Go up and right from here
[3:25:22] <%possumwalsh1221> @dmtjinni learn parry timing and the rest follows.
[3:25:28] <ミュウレ4242> yeah, catholic lore is metal. there's a story about king ghidora trying to eat some chick's baby, but then she jumps off a cliff w/ it and grows wings, angels all fighting him and shit.
[3:25:39] <+HumanDoctor> isn't the pagen tree near here?
[3:25:48] <%notgarza> Firecrackers are a must 2, as well as shurikens imo @dmtjinni
[3:25:50] <dinnydanny777> The story of Cain and Abel is basically about how much God loves meat and hates eating his veggies
[3:25:50] <%DensityD> DensityD subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months! This channel sub streak is growing bigger and stronger, but I don't think it will ever be as much as the mighty Zangief. At least it's not ginger. Keep it up Pat and Paige! (^3^)

[3:26:01] <Jaghatai> Yeah, dlc area on the right most of Jondo
[3:26:02] <$lotharrio> I'm very amused that the character isn't dual wielding. That's just a big, pointy hat.
[3:26:05] <%possumwalsh1221> Omg I just looked at a map layout for this game it’s way bigger than I thought LUL
[3:26:10] <bashful_bard> Deflect more and experiment with what bosses do when they deflect you. Lots of hard sekiro bosses are manageable if you exploit their deflect attacks
[3:26:24] <dukenux> i love how the story of Cain isnpired Inglorious Basterds
[3:26:24] <ミュウレ4242> pointy hats are serious business.
[3:26:28] <dinnydanny777> A lot of Catholic Lore is also watered down Paganism isn't it?
[3:26:28] <%DensityD> tell me more about the bonks? what do the bonks do
[3:26:43] <KaiserMario> There is quicksilver close by, but I don't recommend those now, since you have only 1 Bile Flask...
[3:26:47] <Ner234> Show smol borker

[3:29:57] <dinnydanny777> @dukenux To be honest I don't remember where or which books all the stories come from, I just know some of them
[3:30:01] <ミュウレ4242> was abraham the one who literally fought an angel and won, and got to start a new tribe w/ stat bonuses because of it?

[3:30:51] <%DensityD> the piss is all coffee?

[3:31:09] <GrandmasterBFunk> baby
[3:31:10] <dukenux> oh wait, was it Joseph?
[3:31:11] <fockniapo> what the fuck
[3:31:14] <%doc_ock_rokc> NEVER
[3:31:20] <$lotharrio> But apparently it was Jacob, yeah.
[3:31:22] <fockniapo> there's adog
[3:31:22] <dukenux> goddamit, too many Jojos in the Bibble
[3:31:23] <%ScottishMadJacko> giefmo?
[3:31:46] <%whiskey_wolfe_> So has anyone asked about the EyepatchWolf beef on Twitter yet?
[3:31:46] <BallerSwagBro9k> Ya know it kind of just occured to me that the story of King David is basically the story of king arthur. Probaly what inspired it.
[3:31:50] <%ScottishMadJacko> or zangiefmo?
[3:31:51] <CasualAlohaFriday> Featuring brand new character Zangief!
[3:32:15] <%ragingbrachy> SourPls
[3:32:19] <ミュウレ4242> BallerSwagBro9k, then who was merlin in the bible?
[3:32:28] <%DensityD> so zangief's character card gets even more animation because he does a 2 frame mouth-opening, neat
[3:32:33] <dinnydanny777> @ballerswagbro9k Kind of, but not really, the story of King Arthur is actually literally fanfiction
[3:32:54] <ミュウレ4242> well, lancelot is definitely fanfiction.
[3:33:13] <%DensityD> additional colored shadows as well
[3:33:14] <dinnydanny777> @ballerswagbro9k A story about a king that got turned into a story about a king, a romance novel with a French man and the search for the Holy Grail
[3:33:20] <dukenux> Joseph was proto Moses i think? israeli slave who became an egyptian nobility?
[3:33:24] <BallerSwagBro9k> @ミュウレ4242 David had some guy as a mentor called Samuel i think
[3:33:26] <$lotharrio> Moses was the Bible Merlin.
[3:33:59] <$lotharrio> Literally has duels with wizards at some points, then calls down meteor swarms and firestorms.
[3:34:02] <ミュウレ4242> i think moses had a higher power level than merlin, based soley on the basic feats lists.
[3:34:15] <BallerSwagBro9k> @dinnydanny777 Oh i know its not 100% the same but its has a TON of similarities
[3:34:38] <dinnydanny777> Nah, Moses without his Beyblade is a total bitch
[3:34:38] <$lotharrio> Plus he's got that staff, you know? Classic D&D wizard.
[3:34:40] <%DensityD> does that make Jesus the bible lady of the lake?
[3:34:52] <%DensityD> Jesus is the morgan le fey of the bibile?!?!
[3:35:09] <$lotharrio> Only during Revelations, when he has a sword shooting out of his mouth for some reason.
[3:35:27] <dinnydanny777> That Beyblade is the real hero of Moses's story
[3:35:35] <dukenux> Revelations Jesus is just Yahtzee's PCMR Guy?
[3:35:38] <%FacetiousAF> shit, is he done for the night or just a BRB pee break thing?
[3:35:39] <BallerSwagBro9k> @lotharrio Yeah John was tripping on some shit when he wrote that XD
[3:35:42] <dukenux> its amazing
