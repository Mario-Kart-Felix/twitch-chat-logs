[0:08:18] <%SovPho> You mean two games where 75% of the gameplay is savescumming?

[0:08:37] <+thelonechris> Uh oh

[0:10:10] <+Thyzoon> Forgotten City is the game from the mod developer of that Skyrim mod yea?
[0:10:16] <%pokefan9956> wait. humankind is coming out next week?
[0:10:22] <draca23> Ender Lilies I'm legit interested in. It seems to be Salt and Sanctuary but not utter trash.
[0:10:26] <+fetrigon> @thyzoon yes
[0:10:35] <+fetrigon> humankind is good
[0:10:39] <+rafaelba93> i could do with a new civ
[0:10:41] <%thedankestmeeme> humankind is trhe monkey one right?
[0:10:42] <%pokefan9956> oh shit. I bought it months and months ago
[0:10:45] <%Sotetsu> The combat in Human Kind felt really bad in the beta
[0:10:48] <%WaitHowDidIGetHere> Maybe even rewrite history?
[0:10:54] <+thelonechris> Spoilers; humans came out of the ocean as fish and became monkeys
[0:10:58] <%MidnightBurst12> ye
[0:11:12] <semachie> salt and sanctuary was cool
[0:11:17] <%pokefan9956> I like how it seems like there aren't any real victory conditions.
[0:11:18] <Profmcstevie> Oh look, competence
[0:11:27] <ToneBacas> oh neat
[0:11:30] <+fetrigon> LUL
[0:11:34] <%thedankestmeeme> buit is it the monkey one?
[0:11:36] <derap41> you tryna pimp Adidas?
[0:11:40] <huskarl_zap> just call it personkind
[0:11:41] <SilverFaustX> D:

[0:11:47] <+Seancicle> Woolie dire Salute
[0:11:47] <%thedankestmeeme> im not intrested without the monkey
[0:11:56] <%zuzuxiv> I am lost - oh civ
[0:11:57] <+Fabpsi_> such changes, much reading, big text, wow
[0:11:58] <ToneBacas> put that on the back of the box
[0:12:00] <+rafaelba93> it for MONITORS
[0:12:10] <draca23> Thanks to my computer dying, I can't play any Civ-type games for a couple months :/
[0:12:16] <+TheBitingIrish> What's on his shirt?
[0:12:16] <%Ziegsy> @thedankestmeeme you mean ancestors?
[0:12:28] <%Axellogic> hi
[0:12:30] <%Ziegsy> @TheBitingIrish Paige
[0:12:34] <+TheBitingIrish> HA
[0:12:36] <@TheYellowcouch> there it is. I was wondering what about civ was was hard to understand lol
[0:12:39] <%greasypete00> by "this monitor" do you mean the tv?
[0:12:41] <Profmcstevie> Just play civ at 480p as god intended
[0:12:43] <%thedankestmeeme> @Ziegsy YEH YEH YEH
[0:12:50] <%thedankestmeeme> i just saw humankind
[0:12:52] <%thedankestmeeme> sadge
[0:12:53] <%SovPho> I just want literally no UI
[0:12:55] <%thedankestmeeme> not monkey
[0:12:59] <%Ziegsy> @thedankestmeeme MONKE GOOD GAME
[0:13:00] <@MistyMntns> It is only those types of games that have that tiny text
[0:13:01] <%Sotetsu> I liked everything about Humankind except the combat. It was slow, cluttered, and awkward.
[0:13:05] <+rafaelba93> never had any problems with on reguylar pc monitors
[0:13:05] <%BoxNavy> what is the up with that indeed
[0:13:07] <%trianglehat> because monitors are sharp
[0:13:12] <Profmcstevie> Just give me UI on and off, but make it BEEG by default
[0:13:12] <%thedankestmeeme> YEH YEH YEH
[0:13:14] <%BoxNavy> monkie game
[0:13:15] <+rafaelba93> monke game\
[0:13:21] <draca23> I don't get it either. I usually make text the biggest possible by default.
[0:13:26] <+thelonechris> Return to monke
[0:13:26] <+TheBitingIrish> Monke game looked fun
[0:13:27] <ToneBacas> because some stuff is made with one resolution in mind, and they don't bother to scale stuff like fonts or other UI elements if they're using sprites
[0:13:27] <%BoxNavy> pat play the monkey game
[0:13:30] <+Fabpsi_> I think they figured the "big text for ui" stuff about 10 years ago,  you know some old games have no problem with it...but then ...idk..stuff changed? Maybe the hardware or the way people want to focus less on reading/big texts in games
[0:13:39] <derap41> Civ has Combat?
[0:13:43] <DomunDomunDomun> Remember BC?
[0:13:45] <ToneBacas> play Fallout 2 with ultra-wide resolution
[0:13:45] <%X2Eliah> @PatStaresAt Hey Pat. Why are you fighting with ppl on twitter again?
[0:13:47] <%pokefan9956> civ combat is kinda poopy
[0:13:47] <+D00msDayDan> I loved ancestors
[0:13:47] <%thedankestmeeme> i returned to monke sadge
[0:13:54] <%Ziegsy> Ancestors has to be one of the hardest games Ive ever played. Because dumb.
[0:13:58] <%Sotetsu> I miss my stacks of doom.
[0:14:12] <PyroDrag> Civ is a game where your try hard friend plays Zulu and your capital is sieges by turn 5
[0:14:18] <Gorgs7> ye ye ye, stack of like 30 artillery
[0:14:22] <PyroDrag> sieged*
[0:14:23] <%Valdorick> Hex based Civ Combat is fucking AWFUL.
[0:14:25] <derap41> Get Giant death Robots and win the game
[0:14:26] <+Thyzoon> I really only ever played Civ Revolution, was fun though.
[0:14:26] <+rafaelba93> its like chess
[0:14:27] <Zeemod155> i fucking hated that lol
[0:14:36] <@TheYellowcouch> My favourite civ 5 strategy was the death wall
[0:14:41] <DomunDomunDomun> I hate the stacks.
[0:14:43] <+rafaelba93> only 10?
[0:14:46] <+TDotGoat> and each turn is a year...
[0:14:58] <%Sotetsu> Fall From Heaven 2 was my favorite way to play any Civ game. psaUp
[0:15:03] <%SilvaChariot0133> everybody gangsta till the Ottomans roll up with a 100k doomstack
[0:15:06] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Only way to move units fast is railroads
[0:15:14] <%Valdorick> Each unit type should really stack with a separate unit type. Pair up your melee with arty and archers.
[0:15:20] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> and those are such a pain to build
[0:15:22] <Profmcstevie> Oh you do baby skirmish setups? neat
[0:15:32] <SilverFaustX> crusader kings 3 has death stacks
[0:15:37] <+Fabpsi_> why do i have to think of Deus Ex when I hear humankind...wasn't the name of 1 part humankind or something like that?
[0:15:38] <derap41> Giant train of death
[0:15:57] <+rafaelba93> kind of like total war generals?
[0:15:59] <%Broand> Endless legend huh
[0:16:04] <%Ziegsy> @Fabpsi_ Humankind revolution?
[0:16:04] <theonefinger> so the combat In humankind is like endless legend?
[0:16:06] <%Valdorick> Its like Endless Legends
[0:16:16] <%X2Eliah> @Fabpsi_ there was mankind divided, and 1st was human revolution iirc
[0:16:16] <godila2> that sounds like endless legends
[0:16:17] <%Sotetsu> The Endless Legend combat (which Humankind uses) was originally supposed to be all automatic. Like Endless Legend.
[0:16:18] <+fetrigon> sick KomodoHype
[0:16:24] <%Valdorick> Since it IS just the Endless Engine, it makes sense.
[0:16:26] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> @fabpsi_ and mankind divided after human revolution
[0:16:28] <%Sotetsu> I mean Endless Space.

[0:41:50] <LorcaNomad> Ask him about Mithras, pat
[0:41:52] <%Ipsenscastle> This guy looks terrified of you LUL
[0:41:55] <JdotSweapA> Jebus!
[0:41:57] <sirrice77> @goddamndavid Yes because it would be rome. Rome is forever
[0:41:57] <%Mahbonk> The LAAAW
[0:41:59] <%Piemen99> ha golden
[0:42:00] <draca23> "Follow the law, or we'll kill you"
[0:42:02] <%pokefan9956> I...don't think that's accurate
[0:42:05] <%Pappajimbo> Jesus  hes gonna be a thing
[0:42:07] <%BoxNavy> no :)
[0:42:08] <$Jaxnos> why is mr clean here
[0:42:08] <JdotSweapA> LAAAWWWW
[0:42:08] <+Fabpsi_> did that old roman dude just make the "throat slice" gesture?
[0:42:15] <+Midashu> taking you to see Judge Dredd
[0:42:22] <%Dakuu75> but, we can see the sky right?
[0:42:22] <not_twitter_rowan> @Fabpsi_ yeah, it's that old
[0:42:23] <%Valdorick> Nice of him to give you the choice.
[0:42:26] <stantheman_97> was that a skyrim quest sound?
[0:42:35] <%Ches_Neckbeard> man is this fallout/skyrim engine?
[0:42:36] <+Fabpsi_> must be truly ancient around there
[0:42:43] <DomunDomunDomun> If anyone knows about slicing throats, it's old Roman dudes.
[0:42:50] <Seraphim9> unreal engine iirc
[0:42:50] <goddamndavid> @sirrice77 good point lol
[0:42:53] <$Faustgesicht> I thought for sure you were at the Ides of March
[0:42:58] <ape_hawk> yeah, aurelia, that dick is only for his fiance
[0:43:00] <+tempestzephyr> damn hussy
[0:43:01] <kotl7> """""""politics"""""""
[0:43:02] <Yakobro> @Ches_Neckbeard unreal, but it's a port of a skyrim mod
[0:43:03] <%BlackStarAura> SHE A HOE
[0:43:04] <+Fabpsi_> i think they are more for "stabbing people in the back"-methods
[0:43:09] <draca23> Pat, you're in Rome, get used to people going after your penis
[0:43:12] <%BoxNavy> ok :)
[0:43:15] <@TheYellowcouch> hmmmm interesting name for that lady
[0:43:17] <%DashXero> You already started the sentence, pal. Finish it. What's her deal?
[0:43:17] <%MechArch> oh okay
[0:43:19] <%Piemen99> Yo I'll be down to fuck a ancient Roman whore
[0:43:21] <%Mahbonk> No! You're crazy! D:
[0:43:27] <%Ches_Neckbeard> @Yakobro explains a lot. ty

[0:43:35] <%X2Eliah> ok this odes look cool
[0:43:41] <%X2Eliah> does*
[0:43:43] <goddamndavid> Galerius is taking his situation extraordinarily well
[0:43:43] <+Fabpsi_> how many people, 23? This place is HUGE
[0:43:51] <%Ziegsy> *vincent vice* Lucrecia???
[0:43:54] <$ItsRatman> Thats where the OTHER pats live
[0:43:55] <SivSarcast> Shivers trying to talk to you? :V
[0:43:58] <kotl7> How is this a forgotten city if this guy knows everyone?!
[0:44:02] <@MistyMntns> I'm laughing because his character is in modern clothing and everyone is in Roman clothing.
[0:44:10] <loukemia83> 23 people + all the statues that used to be people
[0:44:11] <KaiserMario> Romani ite Domum
[0:44:12] <propmaster256> I don't know who Galerius is, that's obviously Mr. Clean.
[0:44:14] <derap41> Which means they must be Evilk
[0:44:16] <%WhereIsWill> sup pat n chat laynaHi laynaHi
[0:44:20] <+Fabpsi_> Can't wait for Galerius sidekick: Hilarious!
[0:44:25] <+Fabpsi_> i am...gonna try to go
[0:44:26] <+Daedalus119> @MistyMntns yeah they all make fun of your weird clothes
[0:44:27] <KhaishaD> Why does this chasm of 23 people have a class system
[0:44:36] <%Ghufufin> gameplay 40 min in? is this the right stream
[0:44:37] <%SovPho> These NPCs look better than Skyrim's
[0:44:37] <%UvBenServed> STOP RIGHT THERE CRIMINAL SCUM
[0:44:37] <%ConLin_Arts_> why do they speak English?
[0:44:38] <%Ghufufin> ?
[0:44:42] <%BlackStarAura> GOLDEN RULE
[0:44:46] <goddamndavid> wouldnt Romans sound closer to Italians?
[0:44:47] <%X2Eliah> wait so they *know* Pat just warped in
[0:44:56] <DSD24> Ave true to Caesar
[0:44:56] <%SovPho> @ConLin_Arts_ They established that they are speaking Latin already
[0:45:01] <LorcaNomad> holy shit why don't more games have this follow option
[0:45:03] <+Fabpsi_> @ConLin_Arts_ they are all speaking latin, but thanks to the stargate headache/magic, it sounds like english for us
[0:45:03] <%Valdorick> DECIMATION
[0:45:04] <%LouieRouie> Treat others as you would be treated?
[0:45:05] <%Dakuu75> They keep saying "Golden rule" and I'm jsut thinking of that spiral-box from art school
[0:45:07] <%ConLin_Arts_> ah
[0:45:08] <%GeneralSCPatton> Decimation
[0:45:08] <draca23> "Golden Rule" something tells me if you break it, you turn into a nice sculpture
[0:45:08] <reasonance> I love the face-opened doors
[0:45:17] <propmaster256> Ah, Decimation, yep
[0:45:19] <+Fabpsi_> "This here is our leader, Biggus Dickus"
[0:45:26] <kotl7> wow are those raytraced marble floors?
[0:45:29] <%Gasgrave> Gasgrave subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 41 months! 41 months?! In the immortal words of Owen Wilson, "Wow!"Ender Lilies feels like it has a lot of potential to be an actually interesting map-discovery, collection,  adventure...game. (I'm trying to avoid the obvious buzzwords)
[0:45:31] <%Valdorick> Its Centimation?
[0:45:31] <%Treasure_Vault> centimation
[0:45:34] <derap41> Huh Even the Right period for the use of the Segmentata
[0:45:34] <%X2Eliah> jazz hands
[0:45:35] <%Ziegsy> 10 die?
[0:45:36] <DSD24> What's so funny about Biggus Dickus
[0:45:38] <%RonaldMcDownload> That explained nothing
[0:45:44] <%Agami23> oh. decimation. 10. i get it now
[0:45:48] <SivSarcast> Loot all the cupboards! Oh wait this is not Skyrim.
[0:45:49] <%Dakuu75> Sus-us... Amogus~
[0:45:50] <@ssjklyco> Is  the golden rule "No anime Titties"? Because that's rough
[0:45:50] <%Ziegsy> @DSD24 he has a wife you know
[0:45:59] <SpaceManHotepIV> Summary, nice
[0:46:01] <%BoxNavy> yo, jupiter optimus maximus
[0:46:03] <Tomschiii> oh hell yeah, forgotten city. great title
[0:46:07] <%masterfire23> isn't this a skyrim mod?
[0:46:13] <SivSarcast> I like how they give you a summary for the notes.
[0:46:17] <%Valdorick> Or Hm... Or its unusmation...
[0:46:19] <ape_hawk> the golden rule is "no politics"
[0:46:19] <%BoxNavy> AAGH!
[0:46:22] <+Fabpsi_> i love how he says "there is only 1 RULE" and not tells him that one rule directly, but only the consequences for breaking said 1 rule
[0:46:23] <@TheYellowcouch> Jump button? 10/10 goty
[0:46:23] <stantheman_97> do you find it funny when i say biggus... dickus?
[0:46:25] <not_twitter_rowan> @masterfire23 skyrim mod made into a full game yea
[0:46:25] <DSD24> @masterfire23 I think it used to be but now its a full game
[0:46:26] <SilverFaustX> what if u die here
[0:46:36] <%Ipsenscastle> The golden rule is 'no backseating'
[0:46:39] <draca23> "Did that jackass just jump into fire?"
[0:46:41] <ToneBacas> LUL
[0:46:47] <+Fabpsi_> Pat the curious, I like that sound
[0:46:50] <%GalacticaPhanto> The Golden Rule is Hustle, Loyalty, Family
[0:46:51] <+mattiabh> pat the patrician
[0:46:51] <propmaster256> "We're finally alone"???
[0:46:51] <SpaceManHotepIV> No Pats
[0:46:53] <%Valdorick> What if you named yourself Julius?
[0:46:55] <%SovPho> mihi nomen pat
[0:47:01] <+ReallyBigRocks> I see you have the pissing eyes
[0:47:06] <KhaishaD> I think there was a readable by the fire you jumped in
[0:47:14] <%DashXero> "It's not that wondrous."
[0:47:19] <DomunDomunDomun> I thought he said "I see you have a piercing"
[0:47:20] <%Dakuu75> he's offering you the kool-aid all ready, eh?
[0:47:20] <%VictorVonLouche> The rules gonna be super shitty i bet lol
[0:47:20] <%Agami23> actually, pat is a name that could work here. they could think its short for patroclus or something
[0:47:25] <DSD24> I like this music
[0:47:26] <%bread_assassin> @Ipsenscastle That means if even one person backseats, everyone in chat gets banned. That's hardcore.
[0:47:29] <%BlackStarAura> bend over, boy.
[0:47:31] <+Fabpsi_> 7 months? that is...like....nothing
[0:47:35] <Parapattern> 23 people isn't exactly a community
[0:47:42] <loukemia83> Oh this guy is from the future and took over?  or like....hundreds of years from 65 CE
[0:47:45] <+ReallyBigRocks> @DomunDomunDomun he did but the accent made it sound a little odd lol
[0:47:47] <+mattiabh> good god the exposition
[0:47:48] <%Valdorick> "The golden rule is this... Never get caught shitting. No one shits here, and if we find out you do, you die."
[0:47:50] <%Dakuu75> then why do you need guards???
[0:47:54] <%DashXero> That depends on the definition of "sin."
[0:47:58] <Ner234> 23 people isn't a lot tho
[0:48:02] <%masterfire23> LULi though he said simp
[0:48:02] <%Ipsenscastle> @bread_assassin well he did appoint a million mods
[0:48:04] <+Fabpsi_> 23 people in 7 months is still just in the early phase of "figuring that place out and all the shit we should build"
[0:48:07] <%GeneralSCPatton> THE MURACLE - Blasphemous
[0:48:10] <ape_hawk> define "sin"
[0:48:11] <Sapphire_Breeze> monkaS
[0:48:12] <%Valdorick> Omnimation, got it.
[0:48:14] <+Daedalus119> @Parapattern I disagree
[0:48:18] <@TheYellowcouch> So don't play this game like a skyrim player
[0:48:18] <$ItsRatman> Stab him right now. No balls
[0:48:19] <Ner234> But y tho
[0:48:19] <%X2Eliah> what constitutes a sin?
[0:48:19] <LorcaNomad> big cursed monkaS
[0:48:23] <+ReallyBigRocks> How do you figure that out without everyone dying?
[0:48:23] <Sapphire_Breeze> what's a sin tho
[0:48:23] <%Dakuu75> THAT SOUNDS LIKE A HORRIBLE DEAL
[0:48:27] <kiwicoffin> I guess because no one died yet?
[0:48:28] <%WhereIsWill> dafuq is this blasphemous nonsense
[0:48:29] <%BogBodyPositive> HWAT
[0:48:30] <+red_cuppa> you can only test it once lol
[0:48:32] <%Valdorick> Commit and sin and find out, Save Lord.
[0:48:34] <DSD24> Medusa is pretty hot though
[0:48:38] <+mattiabh> why would you even live there
[0:48:39] <+Fabpsi_> the LAW. the LAW nobody tells me about!
[0:48:45] <%VictorVonLouche> They just said theres no way out
[0:48:45] <draca23> Oh, that plaque earlier makes a lot of sense. "Everyone suffers from the sin of one" or something
[0:48:46] <not_twitter_rowan> @Sapphire_Breeze good fucking question
[0:48:53] <kiwicoffin> Premarital sex about to ruin this town
[0:48:57] <%BogBodyPositive> why do you STAY then???
[0:49:10] <%BlackStarAura> bepis
[0:49:11] <+Daedalus119> @ReallyBigRocks they're making assumptions based on environmental clues, basically. They don't want to risk experimenting to see if it's true
[0:49:17] <Tomschiii> there are reasons for them to stay
[0:49:18] <+haitakaa> is this Minority Report
[0:49:18] <@TheYellowcouch> Me must stop them from spilling their seed
[0:49:19] <%NateyBeak> someones about to beat off and sin so hard
[0:49:19] <Minorou> this sounds familiar to that one popular skyrim mod
[0:49:21] <Parapattern> Latin name for the Greek goddess Persephone
[0:49:22] <ScreamLord> So is this during the time Rome was plagiarizing Greek Mythology or Christian?
[0:49:25] <+Fabpsi_> Oh, those are really nice questions
[0:49:26] <+TDotGoat> I bet it's EVERYONE
[0:49:30] <%BoxNavy> wheres al... jermaPluto
[0:49:33] <+Fabpsi_> did not expect this amount of variet
[0:49:38] <%Treasure_Vault> 00000000000000000000000000000000000........3+++.
[0:49:39] <%Ne1son> @PatStaresAt Proserpina is Roman Persephone
[0:49:40] <not_twitter_rowan> THEY DON'T KNOW.
[0:49:41] <+Daedalus119> @mattiabh because they can't leave
[0:49:41] <DSD24> Is talking shit a sin?
[0:49:46] <SpaceManHotepIV> THEY DON'T KNOW
[0:49:46] <+isadorenta> be gay do crime
[0:49:49] <%Valdorick> Save and murder this man.

[0:59:05] <%blastyoboots> sure, all romans agree on time paradoxes
[0:59:13] <%MugenSandan> just came in, what IS the Golden Rule?
[0:59:13] <%Piemen99> Question does our MC have a wife?
[0:59:15] <stantheman_97> romans had a concept of time paradoxes?
[0:59:17] <%zuzuxiv> gOULden rule
[0:59:17] <%UvBenServed> Hearing a lot of "should"
[0:59:21] <KhaishaD> But if you're sent back to your own time, then the golden rule would be broken again
[0:59:24] <Pookiedaexzile> Dude the fuck You usually don't start till a hour 20 atleast
[0:59:25] <%Puhff> how tf this ancient human know what a paradox is????

[0:59:53] <%X2Eliah> @Puhff they are ancient, not stupid.
[0:59:54] <ape_hawk> thats right, start breaking into peoples places, totally not a sin
[0:59:54] <SivSarcast> Ah so that's how you can loot, uh I mean inspect everyone's houses. You got permission to do so.

[1:00:32] <+Fabpsi_> the golden rule is never lick golden snow
[1:00:45] <%SovPho> paradox just means contrary to thought, it's not like rule-bending bullshit everyone thinks it is
[1:00:46] <Profmcstevie> WHAT WIZARDY, A STAFF OF LUMINATION
[1:00:57] <Pookiedaexzile> Nah, If someone in the past saw a flash light they'd just think you were a god and keep it pushing

[1:04:14] <kiwicoffin> sentia, lesser sentia, least sentius
[1:04:16] <draca23> I like how the more you talk to her, let her get her stress about her sister off her chest, she calms down.
[1:04:17] <%joodatious> her face is so tired
[1:04:18] <%BoxNavy> :)
[1:04:20] <%HairballCT> why does she sound like great value dao morrigan

[1:06:33] <%joodatious> what is the point of this game?
[1:06:34] <sirrice77> @mattiabh we care because we're stuck with them
[1:06:43] <%Treasure_Vault> "I needed to meet you in my military garb."?

[1:08:53] <@Lion_kun> He deserves a pat on the back.

[1:09:19] <@MistyMntns> I love how they display their unfortunate people.
[1:09:20] <SpartanSeventyEight> Not the MH scoutflies, they didn't snap your neck to get your attention.
[1:09:20] <%AncelDeLambert> if you touch the egg, do we all wake up in a desert?

[1:09:47] <%Agami23> apollo throwing the gift of prophesy at one random person on the internet is my favorite.
[1:09:48] <sightlesspoem> Being a shitty doctor is a sin
[1:09:50] <Pookiedaexzile> Jokes on you Body squats are better
[1:09:50] <%CalderGaming> oh thank god someone who's not a British Roman
[1:09:51] <@TheYellowcouch> she was fished
[1:09:51] <%MechArch> why she have that accent?
[1:09:54] <draca23> "I killed Aerith before Sephiroth could"
[1:09:59] <%X2Eliah> well a poisoning would be a sin
[1:10:00] <loukemia83> She was poisoned...and everyone isn't gold?  Poisoning isn't a sin apparently?
[1:10:02] <Calamity2007> I remember playing the Skyrim mod of this. It was pretty good and I am glad that it is its own thing
[1:10:05] <+Fabpsi_> That is a normal Latin accent
[1:10:05] <propmaster256> Nirnroot huh?
[1:10:08] <%Piemono> They all have accents
[1:10:09] <%BlackStarAura> It's time for some gelato
[1:10:09] <+Fabpsi_> you don't know how they talked back then
[1:10:13] <derap41> Silphium is the stuff that makes your dick hard
[1:10:21] <%Meekest> That sounds like a villain
[1:10:23] <%AncelDeLambert> no he didn't say that shut the fuck up
[1:10:25] <KhaishaD> Well, I guess murder isn't against the Golden Rule
[1:10:32] <Tomschiii> he is the best tho^^
[1:10:32] <%joodatious> is this game just walking around talking to boring people?
[1:10:58] <Calamity2007> @joodatious Kinda yeah, it is a mystery game
[1:11:00] <+Fabpsi_> talking to boring people with fancy accents
[1:11:04] <%AncelDeLambert> don't overthink it
[1:11:04] <loukemia83> It's like...if I put a snake or venomous spider in your room, and it bites you, that is just nature, not a sin
[1:11:06] <%Ne1son> He didnt kill her though
[1:11:06] <sightlesspoem> Necromancer hype
[1:11:07] <@ssjklyco> So being an asshole is fine, just don't do sin?
[1:11:08] <+Fabpsi_> i am entertained
[1:11:08] <%vandastelka> loop holes i guess?
[1:11:10] <%X2Eliah> @joodatious yes
[1:11:11] <kiwicoffin> How does that guy know extortion failed isn't a crime?
[1:11:14] <TheFramedWarlock> This game looks incredibly boring
[1:11:15] <+mattiabh> @joodatious yes so far
[1:11:17] <+rdark_ksu> maybe only direct violent premeditated murder
[1:11:19] <%joodatious> awesome
[1:11:22] <ToneBacas> boring people with important things to say even
[1:11:26] <%AncelDeLambert> @ssjklyco I mean, that's life
[1:11:30] <%Ne1son> Only if you subscribe to that school of thought
[1:11:31] <%Piemono> Is that a crime in Rome thou
[1:11:32] <@TheYellowcouch> This would get your doctor's license revoked for sure
[1:11:32] <sightlesspoem> Centrism us not a sin in Rome
[1:11:34] <%Dakuu75> I like her

[1:11:39] <%joodatious> ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper
[1:11:40] <%Ipsenscastle> 'depraved indifference' is a great turn of phrase
[1:11:43] <Sunstalker> Is that latin for arsehole?
[1:11:48] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[1:11:49] <Pookiedaexzile> Depraved Indifference is my new Lofi band who can play drums
[1:11:50] <%joodatious> @sightlesspoem it should of been
[1:11:56] <+redthebaron> me too
[1:11:57] <kiwicoffin> Wait MULTIPLE people have disappeared?
[1:11:59] <%Puhff> Imagine calling characters boring after learning almost nothing about them
[1:12:01] <Yakobro> @joodatious don't watch then
[1:12:01] <sightlesspoem> agreed
[1:12:19] <%joodatious> @Yakobro jokes on you im not watching
[1:12:21] <%DashXero> Ouch.
[1:12:24] <+Fabpsi_> where is the person carrying all the owls to rome?
[1:12:33] <%Movemeister> LUL
[1:12:54] <Sunstalker> If this is really Rome, why aren't they cooking da pizza? D:
[1:12:55] <sightlesspoem> oh yeah that's fuckin subtle
[1:12:58] <%joodatious> ah the river styx
[1:13:01] <$SGrim> When there's fire, styx to the river.
[1:13:01] <KhaishaD> @kiwicoffin Three of em
[1:13:02] <%joodatious> good job dummy
[1:13:05] <commanderapathy> did they have dowries back then?
[1:13:07] <brainbustaaaaa> leapt in the river with all that money, huh?
[1:13:09] <%AzureGale> FORNICATING
[1:13:11] <%aogman> aogman subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months! ohhhh goddddddddddddddd
[1:13:12] <Parapattern> Subtext is for cowards
[1:13:12] <+Fabpsi_> *wink wink nudge nudge*
[1:13:19] <@MistyMntns> @SGrim I crackled at this.
[1:13:20] <sightlesspoem> she should've seen the big green skulls in the river
[1:13:24] <%joodatious> HMMM
[1:13:27] <%joodatious> i wonderr
[1:13:29] <kiwicoffin> surely there's no pattern here
[1:13:30] <sightlesspoem> marking it as the death river
[1:13:41] <%vandastelka> maybe
[1:13:43] <+redthebaron> that is a good guess
[1:13:45] <propmaster256> I can't believe a mudcrab got her
[1:13:47] <+TheAdMerlin> Rome burned, did you forget about Nero?
[1:13:50] <%CalderGaming> wow i was joking about Pompeii Premium but,
[1:13:51] <sirrice77> @commanderapathy yes
[1:13:56] <%Piemen99> Are we not going to talk about golden statues?
[1:13:57] <Kingjoker310> could be
[1:13:58] <%Puhff> Rome burned, dude
[1:13:58] <%ElkRiverDog> Or Rome when it burned down
[1:14:01] <marcomatame> only cowards use subtext, we need to start using the Chad DOMtext
[1:14:02] <derap41> Nero wasn't even in fucking Rome
[1:14:03] <%Agami23> rome has alot of fires
[1:14:04] <LilacsandFreedom> if it was Pompeii it'd be the ash that's the biggest issue, I think
[1:14:06] <%Movemeister> Pretty sure it’s Rome
[1:14:07] <@MistyMntns> This is kinda very hard on the nose in referencing Mythology.
[1:14:12] <%Ipsenscastle> Jesus burned Rome down
[1:14:17] <+Fabpsi_> Pat KNOWING years but not rivers in rome....this is getting sus
[1:14:18] <%vivaldiva> didn't rome burn every other day pretty much?
[1:14:19] <%Puhff> Pompei didn't burn down, it fucking exploded
[1:14:19] <%Meekest> Yeah I bet she did
[1:14:21] <sightlesspoem> There was probably more than one roman fire
[1:14:21] <studleydoorite> up to date is an odd way to describe that LUL
[1:14:22] <+mattiabh> that was in 64
[1:14:25] <%X2Eliah> Pompeii blew in 79 ad tho
[1:14:26] <%GeneralSCPatton> I am really curious what the Skyrim version is like without all the Roman context and subtext
[1:14:30] <%Puhff> Yeah you're not cuz you're super wrong

[1:23:19] <+rdark_ksu> Imagine Italian but with a german acccent for example
[1:23:19] <tanarath> Probably included east asian people.
[1:23:22] <+TheAdMerlin> Rome had north Africa, Greece, Syria, Britain, Spain, France, into Germany and austria
[1:23:22] <+Fabpsi_> maybe the Magic is just racist. Is that the answer?
[1:23:28] <%Ipsenscastle> @Pookiedaexzile it's just US shorthand for aristocracy
[1:23:28] <%SaiyanShoto> But they don’t have a New York accent
[1:23:30] <leinadtonu> So Roman's were like New Yorkers?
[1:23:31] <sirrice77> @BoomerTiro they're from rome though? all of them?
[1:23:45] <tanarath> They found someone from east asian in britian from like 100 CE
[1:23:49] <sightlesspoem> this might be more of a purgatory test
[1:23:49] <%BoxNavy> oh no :)
[1:23:51] <+Fabpsi_> can't wait to meet the new-yorker italian-rome-person
[1:24:03] <+BoomerTiro> @sirrice77 Are they? Honestly everything about this seems inconsistent
[1:24:04] <%Dakuu75> Nooo... nooo... nooo... (Bring more lemon pledge)
[1:24:06] <+Fabpsi_> 23 people are enough so they might exist
[1:24:12] <%Puhff> LUL
[1:24:21] <stantheman_97> "oh nooooo that's not normal" LUL
[1:24:22] <%joodatious> it would be nice if this game wasn't in english. its not like this game is going for mass audience appeal
[1:24:27] <%Meekest> This seems like a cool puzzle game
[1:24:34] <tanarath> It IS
[1:24:41] <%BoxNavy> lubooblia
[1:24:41] <sirrice77> @BoomerTiro well as far as i know everyone here came from some part of rome
[1:24:44] <leinadtonu> I wanna hear someone go "forget about it"
[1:24:59] <%joodatious> this seems like the kind of game you rather watch someone play rather then doing yourself
[1:25:00] <+Fabpsi_> and "I am walking here"
[1:25:03] <kiwicoffin> clearly it doesn't matter if the crime is discovered, it just has to happen
[1:25:05] <Pookiedaexzile> Listen I just wanna see a Roman thing with Italian accents so I can make pizza pasta jokes
[1:25:06] <+mattiabh> is trying to cover a crime a sin itself?
[1:25:07] <%Ipsenscastle> @joodatious It'd probably be real difficult to do it in Latin. It'd be cool though for sure!
[1:25:08] <tanarath> This is everything I want from elder scrolls that it will NEVER deliver.
[1:25:10] <+BigBruthaThunda> someone in this city hates sand
[1:25:21] <$SGrim> BOOBA
[1:25:21] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[1:25:29] <%blastyoboots> "trying to help me" --she wants to die?
[1:25:30] <@MistyMntns> I suppose?! Ungrateful person
[1:25:42] <%Puhff> Hey chat, let's not make fun of someone's accent. Just cuz you've never heard an African accent doesn't mean it's "bad" or "weird".
[1:25:42] <sightlesspoem> her haircuts the fucckin sin lamo gottem
[1:25:54] <ExpressNode> Her eyes look crazy
[1:26:00] <%Ziegsy> talk them into taking it themself would be suicide, right?
[1:26:05] <+Fabpsi_> golden rule "you must die with poison if your haircut is weird"
[1:26:06] <goddamndavid> gave herself the poison
[1:26:07] <sightlesspoem> bitch let me be batman
[1:26:15] <@TheYellowcouch> Do you do poision
[1:26:17] <%DashXero> I've got time.
[1:26:18] <%joodatious> @Puhff what if you've heard many african accents and theirs is shitty?
[1:26:20] <KhaishaD> She looks like her hair is tied back in a bun with a wig on top
[1:26:29] <%kingofasgard> i dunno, i think Mr X was more persistent
[1:26:31] <%Dakuu75> ok, I like that she used "saga" instead of "story"
[1:26:40] <Pookiedaexzile> African accents cool, the british is weird, this language didn't exist how did the posh version come to be
[1:26:53] <kiwicoffin> 1000 denarii is just a meme here
[1:26:53] <%Ipsenscastle> does she have a secret smaller haircut underneath her haircut?
[1:26:55] <%cvp5127> im guessing children would be a bad idea here
[1:27:03] <%Pappajimbo> Fun fact: romans had a primative steam engine. But considered just a toy
[1:27:06] <sightlesspoem> is loan sharks not a sin?
[1:27:08] <%joodatious> I understand faces aren't easy but.. you probably shouldn't shove the camera in the faces of crappy face models
[1:27:13] <+redthebaron> that is the same amount the dude asked for the cure of the poison
[1:27:18] <+Fabpsi_> so just making yourself a slave with loans? neat.
[1:27:19] <Tomschiii> @Pookiedaexzile isnt it rather the opposite. brit is cool, afri = weird?
[1:27:21] <Animal_Farm4> A gun
[1:27:24] <%Sotetsu> I mean, if you're running away, might as well max out your credit cards.
[1:27:27] <%LouieRouie> Poison?
[1:27:28] <loukemia83> Debt Slavery should clearly some kind of sin
[1:27:28] <%BlackStarAura> Time travel would be so fucked if it was an actual thing. Too many people would try to change history
[1:27:29] <%AzureGale> Oh jesus
[1:27:30] <reonome> i mean, she's not wrong
[1:27:31] <%Sotetsu> Oh no.
[1:27:32] <+mattiabh> how are these not sins lol
[1:27:45] <+Fabpsi_> totally not a sin
[1:27:46] <@ssjklyco> In a place of 23 people, what are you gonna do with soo much money?
[1:27:46] <%Ne1son> Caveat emptor
[1:27:49] <%MelBrooksKA> @Pookiedaexzile The African accent probably didn't exist either, language changes a lot
[1:27:51] <kiwicoffin> WTF is she going to do with that money anyways
[1:27:52] <+redthebaron> that is pretty much killing someone
[1:28:06] <%Ziegsy> @mattiabh disclaimers
[1:28:08] <%Ne1son> @Fabpsi_ I mean the sign was right there
[1:28:10] <+Fabpsi_> Note: Capitalism & betrayal ) not a sin.
[1:28:10] <%Meekest> But they didnt break the rule
[1:28:11] <%X2Eliah> How. Is that not a sin
[1:28:14] <kiwicoffin> Usury is literally a sin
[1:28:20] <propmaster256> That is legit killing somebody, how doesn't that count??
[1:28:31] <Calamity2007> @Fabpsi_ What is this the United States?
[1:28:31] <+Fabpsi_> Idk, it is reallly getting into sin-territory
[1:28:33] <sightlesspoem> ACAB
[1:28:38] <%Piemen99> didnt romans live until like 60, she looks at least early 30s
[1:28:40] <%CalderGaming> ah so it's about law not justice
[1:28:40] <%joodatious> the concept for the game is cool but all the writing for the characters are so bland. ResidentSleeper
[1:28:48] <%DashXero> This Golden Rule is fucked.
[1:28:50] <+mattiabh> this golden rule has so many asteriks
[1:28:52] <+Fabpsi_> @Calamity2007 well earlier people said this was hell...so...maybe?
[1:28:52] <%Treuan> Jesus
[1:29:05] <+redthebaron> this is a bad rule
[1:29:07] <%X2Eliah> Ok, so the Golden Rule is just some lawyer rule-phrasing porn
[1:29:09] <%joodatious> @Piemen99 depends who you were
[1:29:11] <+Fabpsi_> Golden Rule is "Idk, just wing it and hope for the best" so far
[1:29:11] <propmaster256> The Golden Rule (Some Restrictions May Apply)
[1:29:13] <$Faustgesicht> Part of her contract, sadly
[1:29:14] <%Broand> Lawful evil counts it seems
[1:29:17] <sightlesspoem> thats fuckin cartoonish
[1:29:26] <%Sigma_190_Beta> Wowzers... this is cartoonish.
[1:29:28] <Djinnazz> why not just kill them.
[1:29:31] <%Piemen99> @Piemen99 understandable
[1:29:33] <+mattiabh> ok, at what point do you say fuck it and bring everyone down with you?
[1:29:34] <sightlesspoem> wheres cruella skinning puppies cuz its not a sin
[1:29:34] <+Mrbaconator> so what happens when someone says i dont care if everyone dirs
[1:29:35] <%Valdorick> Suicide? That's a sin.
[1:29:36] <%joodatious> also there are romans and then there are Romans
[1:29:44] <%Sotetsu> You prevented her from killing herself, you mobster.
[1:29:46] <Tomschiii> @joodatious nah, its pretty okay. they have enough
[1:29:47] <commanderapathy> golden rule getting really vague
[1:29:49] <Ner234> So suicide doesn't count?
[1:29:49] <TheFramedWarlock> The writing of this game is so on the nose it might as well be the nose
[1:29:51] <%blastyoboots> THAT MEANS THERE'S MORE HEMLOCK
[1:29:53] <%Dakuu75> fuck off. just DON'T honor the deal, because it's shit
[1:29:53] <goddamndavid> called it
[1:29:53] <%LouieRouie> So suicide doesn't count
[1:30:02] <kiwicoffin> she succeeded in the other timeline, so yeah...
[1:30:03] <%AncelDeLambert> no no no, you tried to CON a loan shark
[1:30:08] <sightlesspoem> not honring the deal is sin
[1:30:11] <sightlesspoem> probably
[1:30:11] <sirrice77> @TheFramedWarlock subtext is for cowards
[1:30:18] <%JehutyVer2> you didn't save me life, you ruined my death!
[1:30:20] <commanderapathy> @ner234 apparently not
[1:30:21] <%Sigma_190_Beta> YOU TRIED TO CON A LOAN SHARK.
[1:30:23] <%joodatious> @joodatious not sure "pretty okay" is much praise lmao
[1:30:26] <+Fabpsi_> this is the big question, and this could be really interesting
[1:30:28] <loukemia83> Iulia is going to kill them, thats the sin, kill her
[1:30:38] <%DashXero> Hm... Potential weapon, maybe?
[1:30:39] <DSD24> Fraud Not Detected
[1:30:39] <derap41> God Ordained that Suicide is Badass
[1:30:44] <%kingofasgard> ah so it's acti-blizz
[1:30:45] <%AncelDeLambert> the thing is, SHE tried to fraud FIRST
[1:30:45] <+Fabpsi_> and maybe suicide can be a rulebreaking thing if you do it with the wrong intentions
[1:30:57] <%Dakuu75> uh-oh
[1:30:57] <%AncelDeLambert> now that she's being held to the agreement, it isn't fraud anymore
[1:31:06] <goddamndavid> but then why was your friend turned t ogold?
[1:31:09] <+Fabpsi_> like, no suicide "for fun", only if you sign a contract or if you want to save another person
[1:31:15] <commanderapathy> pacts can be broken
[1:31:21] <sightlesspoem> oh shut up
[1:31:26] <%AncelDeLambert> oathbreaking is a sin
[1:31:30] <sightlesspoem> i cant NOT kill myself :(
[1:31:37] <%Dakuu75> Why not TELL EVERYONE about the scam?
[1:31:40] <commanderapathy> well shit
[1:31:43] <%kingofasgard> thrown himself from the highest mountain in all of ~greece~ rome
[1:32:06] <+Fabpsi_> "don't take to long" pat "tell me EVERYTHING about you!!" "ok."
[1:32:22] <kiwicoffin> especially since not all of them will be alive in every loop
[1:32:27] <Yakobro> ferroSmuggy
[1:32:28] <%Treuan> It feels kind of like Outer Wilds, going to each planet to learn new breadcrumbs for other plants
[1:32:28] <Tomschiii> yeah, outer wilds but not so good but still pretty sweet
[1:32:33] <+Fabpsi_> timeloops are always fun
[1:32:37] <%BlackStarAura> That zip line will come in clutch
[1:32:41] <derap41> Pretty sure ypu
[1:32:42] <sightlesspoem> i hope theres a lotte4ry in this town you can scam
[1:32:44] <%GeneralSCPatton> I wonder if the ending depends on how many loops you take
[1:32:49] <$Faustgesicht> Curious if Seneca's Golden Rule has sway
[1:32:58] <%Ipsenscastle> I can't wait for Outer Wilds 2
[1:33:00] <Calamity2007> How many NPCs did the original mod have?
[1:33:02] <+Fabpsi_> yea
[1:33:04] <derap41> Pretty sure you're not suppose to pray to Vulkan
[1:33:05] <+mattiabh> outer wilds has other mechanics outside talking tho
[1:33:05] <kiwicoffin> into the horse LUL
[1:33:05] <%DashXero> Goddamned River.
[1:33:06] <%Ziegsy> did they all go in with valu- pat got there
[1:33:09] <$Faustgesicht> diving into the horse?
[1:33:10] <sightlesspoem> you gott have coins for Karen
[1:33:14] <Parapattern> Purgatory for greedy people
[1:33:15] <+FoolsArcade> into the horse!?
[1:33:15] <Tomschiii> @Ipsenscastle you mean the addon
[1:33:19] <$SGrim> Valuables... perhaps to pay some kind of toll?
[1:33:19] <%AncelDeLambert> I don't imagine this game will have an Outer Wilds situation where you can beat the game in fifteen minutes once you know where to go
[1:33:25] <+redthebaron> fair
[1:33:31] <DianaTheAscian> Pat
[1:33:34] <%CalderGaming> wow rude
[1:33:37] <%AzureGale> Pat is a doo doo head
[1:33:38] <SpaceManHotepIV> oopsie poopsie
[1:33:38] <goddamndavid> Iulia will remember that
[1:33:39] <@TheYellowcouch> This timeloop stuff can get real interesting if you both have to save everyone and stop the golden rule
[1:33:41] <%GeneralSCPatton> Yeah, ironic punishment for greedy people?
[1:33:43] <%Ipsenscastle> @Tomschiii I'm just wishfully thinking of a whole sequel
[1:33:44] <chaosbringer28> conversation options matter
[1:33:46] <Calamity2007> @AncelDeLambert Not the good ending anyway
[1:33:50] <commanderapathy> so what about accidental death?
[1:33:52] <+ReallyBigRocks> wow those cheekbones are blasting out of his face
[1:33:55] <+ReallyBigRocks> strong
[1:33:58] <%Broand> didn't you start with a denarius in your inventory
[1:34:00] <Pookiedaexzile> Wait what
[1:34:01] <%AzureGale> I bet saying "suck my own ass" would break the golden rule
[1:34:03] <%bread_assassin> @AncelDeLambert I don't know about the time, but there's a trophy for beating the game without looping.
[1:34:08] <loukemia83> Watch your step?  Or what?  You will beat me and kill all of us?  Big Threats golden boy
[1:34:10] <+redthebaron> big babylon dude
[1:34:10] <Tomschiii> @Ipsenscastle idk about that. i think its a one time thing in general, even with a sequel
[1:34:29] <Mattais88> Man, I can really see the Skyrim in him
[1:34:29] <derap41> IronClad is a ship designation and nothing else
[1:34:30] <%vandastelka> true
[1:34:35] <Parapattern> Can you imagine if everyone literally just floated down the river and this isn't some kind of afterlife
[1:34:37] <%Ipsenscastle> @Tomschiii yeah, not same world, just same general idea
[1:34:43] <+Fabpsi_> "Hello, I am Rufius! Here, have a drink!" .... "Did...did you just put a little pill in my drink before giving it to me?"  ... "What? Me? NOooo, what am I? Some kind of rufee-pill-dealer?"
[1:35:00] <+isadorenta> nooo my secret rheumatism
[1:35:07] <%joodatious> we certainly are not in rome since he wouldn't be allowed to have a weapon anyway
[1:35:10] <Pookiedaexzile> Awww his venerable now
[1:35:13] <%NopeBadguy> Is it just me or do these facial expressions seem...uncanny?
[1:35:17] <Tomschiii> @Ipsenscastle difficult, truly difficult
[1:35:19] <+ReallyBigRocks> Forbidden Arthritis
[1:35:19] <kiwicoffin> constant pain can change personalities
[1:35:19] <sightlesspoem> the ru in rufius stands for rumatism
[1:35:42] <loukemia83> Have some opium, should be fine
[1:35:44] <+Fabpsi_> rheumatism...as bad as  boneitis
[1:35:47] <Tomschiii> the thing is, you are the character, not like you are you in outer wilds
[1:35:55] <$SGrim> He has gout!
[1:35:58] <derap41> Is this game going to be solved with a mass suicide
[1:35:59] <%joodatious> everyone here is an asshole
[1:36:06] <Pookiedaexzile> Tsundere Pain man
[1:36:08] <sightlesspoem> sounds like a future loop problem

[1:46:48] <%DashXero> Why didn't he see Ulpius?
[1:46:50] <+Fabpsi_> So what I get so far about the moral of this game: Stealing is a sin, BUT it literally solves ALL YOUR PROBLEMS longterm
[1:46:50] <DianaTheAscian> yup
[1:46:51] <derap41> Makes the Brain Goblins happy
[1:46:52] <+BoomerTiro> Majora's Mask

[1:47:02] <+BoomerTiro> @ssjklyco Ehhhhh! High five
[1:47:02] <ExpressNode> @ssjklyco I was just thinking that
[1:47:05] <+tempestzephyr> pat loves stealing
[1:47:09] <+mattiabh> steal everything, pretty much
[1:47:12] <%Ipsenscastle> the fact that you have infinite silphium seems pretty weird
[1:47:15] <chaosbringer28> i just realized, if you took the key before hand it would have been stealing, and thus a reset
[1:47:22] <%AzureGale> Is this basically speedrunning the apocalypse: the game?
[1:47:27] <Pookiedaexzile> Oh snap
[1:47:30] <%AncelDeLambert> mumblemumblemumble
[1:47:32] <%Ziegsy> youre not a stoic...
[1:47:34] <derap41> Debate me with facts and logic
[1:47:36] <%AncelDeLambert> WHAT?
[1:47:37] <%GeneralSCPatton> Stoicism = Poker face as a lifestyle
[1:47:38] <$Faustgesicht> Stoicism, eh?
[1:47:39] <%AncelDeLambert> I CAN'T HEAR YOU
[1:47:41] <+ReallyBigRocks> Very quiet, very far conversation
[1:47:43] <+redthebaron> oh horatio
[1:47:45] <%Ipsenscastle> Oim a cockney geezah
[1:47:46] <+Fabpsi_> they can't here each other so far apart
[1:47:46] <ExpressNode> That sounded like a Skyrim sound effect
[1:47:51] <%AzureGale> I CAN'T HEAR YOU
[1:47:56] <%Ipsenscastle> from SAAAAAHHFFF landan
[1:48:00] <sightlesspoem> fuckin political ads

[1:48:13] <@ssjklyco> that was a bad one, pat
[1:48:14] <+fetrigon> she chillin
[1:48:15] <%kingofasgard> wow, bitch
[1:48:18] <+wmeldrum> the coliseum has a giant ancient penis graffiti. it's rad
[1:48:18] <goddamndavid> you're wearing her moms period??
[1:48:29] <+mattiabh> is the golden rule some kind of panopticon?
[1:48:33] <kiwicoffin> the gold border is nice sir
[1:48:34] <%Bailey__gaming> she looks uber umcomfortable
[1:48:34] <@TheYellowcouch> I'm a big fan of the colour. no reason
[1:48:35] <ChungusQuest> red and gold is a great combo
[1:48:38] <+Fabpsi_> fancy gold border. For the next stream i am waiting for the fancy gold ginger buddha
[1:48:39] <SpaceManHotepIV> Nice gold border
[1:48:41] <RamenRiderZ> A bit cross eyed there
[1:48:43] <karismaticprik> "That outfit breaks the golden rule. BUUUURRRNNN"
[1:48:45] <%DashXero> Blasphemy is off the menu.
[1:48:46] <%joodatious> she says lounging casually
[1:48:49] <scrumbotime> Blasphemy no, Suicide no, Stealing DIE!
[1:48:49] <%HairballCT> god's like "eh, that's fair"
[1:48:51] <+ReallyBigRocks> gold border is very cash money
[1:49:01] <%Meekest> I find it really cool that the conversations clue you in on what isnt and isnt a rule breaker
[1:49:04] <%Ziegsy> unless youre the only one who can break the rule?
[1:49:07] <rosemon5001> pog hail satan time
[1:49:09] <%Bailey__gaming> WHO SITS LIKE THIS!
[1:49:09] <sightlesspoem> Ego ist a sin for sure
[1:49:13] <kiwicoffin> someone with no reason to lie to you? yeah probably
[1:49:14] <sightlesspoem> isnt*
[1:49:18] <1matheuw> is this a visual novel?
[1:49:20] <%DashXero> I hope she gets turned to gold first.
[1:49:23] <sightlesspoem> or i guess pride
[1:49:24] <%GeneralSCPatton> This barbarian is a time lord psaBougie psaDab
[1:49:29] <%greasypete00> she doesn't look very relaxed
[1:49:39] <Kingjoker310> YIKES
[1:49:39] <1matheuw> damn she kinda woke
[1:49:41] <+Fabpsi_> it is a time-travel-puzzle-solving-fps-murder-mystery-game. Duuuh.
[1:49:43] <+Fabpsi_> the usual
[1:49:43] <%Ipsenscastle> trade off to who, you live in a hole
[1:49:50] <Pookiedaexzile> Time Barbarians is the name this game should have had
[1:50:05] <%Ziegsy> calling it, the only one who can break the rule is the player
[1:50:08] <1matheuw> ah yes its a TTPSFPSMMG
[1:50:16] <%Bailey__gaming> time for Sparticus Quotes!
[1:50:25] <$Faustgesicht> How does "Treat others as you would have them do unto you" fit into this actions
[1:50:27] <dekkitout> Dialogue skipping as canon
[1:50:31] <Tomschiii> thats why galerius is the best, he takes it like a champ

[1:52:00] <Calamity2007> I think this dialogue was like note for note in the original mod
[1:52:01] <DianaTheAscian> Why not just do terrible shit until you figure out which specific  things break the rule?
[1:52:02] <+mattiabh> might be a red herring, you never know
[1:52:03] <kiwicoffin> Even if you know the big reveal, the little mysteries are where the game is
[1:52:08] <%Bailey__gaming> TBH the Romans just stole all their gods and myths from the greeks anyway
[1:52:09] <%vandastelka> its the whole Baldur problem again
[1:52:16] <+rdark_ksu> I read a shit load of greek myth as a kid, its weird when it pops up in story stuff
[1:52:16] <+redthebaron> lets steal more money
[1:52:20] <%Bailey__gaming> they just renamed them
[1:52:20] <%Piemen99> Can we punch people?

[1:52:47] <%Bailey__gaming> @PatStaresAt What of Noble Batiatias?
[1:52:56] <%AzureGale> Is that a prototype Master Chief helmet
[1:53:00] <%bassoontyphoon> Tylenol should be good for the rheumatism

[1:53:35] <dukenux> why does Horatius' face look real-er
[1:53:40] <%Ipsenscastle> Horatius seems cool
[1:53:44] <Mattais88> I guess that expains why there's a sisyphus statue at the suicide cliff
[1:53:46] <+mattiabh> why does everyone seem unhappy to be here
[1:53:56] <+Fabpsi_> no hair - only helmet --> face looks "better"
[1:53:59] <DianaTheAscian> his face is less unreal
[1:54:01] <Tomschiii> why would anyone be happy here
[1:54:03] <@ssjklyco> If that one guy running for election doesn't think the Golden Rule is real, then why does he not just murder the Magistrate and his guards?  If it's not real then just break rules.
[1:54:04] <1matheuw> OMG it was nero er I mean, the christians all along !!!
[1:54:06] <%Bailey__gaming> this guy is cool
[1:54:07] <%Dakuu75> did they all jump into a literal river styx?
[1:54:19] <Pookiedaexzile> Lightings better and more of it is covered
[1:54:23] <%moonmintparadise> sounds like he has a STYX up his ass
[1:54:23] <%Puhff> @mattiabh cuz they can't leave and miss their friends/family?
[1:54:25] <dukenux> So is this Rome, or is this a legally distinct Rome
[1:54:30] <Zudrag> they all had valuables on them, did they pay the ferryman on the river styx?
[1:54:43] <@MistyMntns> Jesus now everyone gets it lol
[1:54:46] <sirrice77> @ssjklyco because murder is wrong? Like it's not just law that keeps people from doing bad things
[1:54:59] <%Pappajimbo> Ah yes floating in his iron amour
[1:55:00] <%Sigma_190_Beta> @dukenux This is a district of Rome.

[1:57:49] <%joodatious> time to eat these babies for Rome
[1:57:54] <+Fabpsi_> "War crimes? We don't do that here"....yeaaa...funny enough people also say that in my time
[1:58:05] <@MistyMntns> Real talk, Why is modern media obsessed with Mythology right now?
[1:58:06] <%Bailey__gaming> That sounds like Rome to me
[1:58:07] <%Shubreaker> Malleolus?
[1:58:16] <%AzureGale> PainStaresAt
[1:58:17] <Tomschiii> i guess we can skip ender lillies and play this one?
[1:58:21] <%Shubreaker> might as well name him Le Bad Guy
[1:58:24] <1matheuw> time to burn some orphanages for the greater good(s)
[1:58:25] <%Bailey__gaming> that's an evil name tbh
[1:58:28] <commanderapathy> mmmmm, you wouldn't be saying that if you saw what happens in the future
[1:58:29] <%joodatious> @MistyMntns same reason media has always been obsessed with mythology
[1:58:29] <PartyFavors> @MistyMntns media is always obsessed with mythology
[1:58:33] <stantheman_97> i like that clashings between modern and ancient morality here
[1:58:39] <%GeneralSCPatton> "War crimes"? Sounds like something for weak pansies who don't like having their babies set on fire.
[1:58:39] <Tomschiii> @MistyMntns the question is rather why is is always the same mythology
[1:58:40] <%Movemeister> Good old rat boy
[1:58:42] <%joodatious> even back in ancient rome they loved mythology in forms of fiction
[1:58:47] <%Bailey__gaming> Equity the Priestest
[1:58:53] <dekkitout> @MistyMntns Because once upon a time, some dudes around a campfire needed something to do to pass the time
[1:58:56] <%Pappajimbo> War crimes? Laughs  in crucifixion
[1:58:59] <dukenux> war crimes weren't invented yet
[1:59:08] <kiwicoffin> @MistyMntns modern mythology is wrapped up in modern politics i guess
[1:59:13] <+Fabpsi_> they change the mythology from time to time (and depending on the region you are living in a little bit)
[1:59:17] <dukenux> its just all good soldier fun time for now
[1:59:27] <@MistyMntns> I think this year's Mythology that everyone is Obsessed with is Hades and Persephone right now.
[1:59:30] <Pookiedaexzile> Why wouldn't he suspect you
[1:59:39] <+Fabpsi_> so sometimes egypt is in the spotlight, sometimes greek stuff, or rome, sometimes nordic stuff
[1:59:50] <Pookiedaexzile> Someone goes missing and you stroll into town
[1:59:57] <%Bailey__gaming> oh dont let this guy be doing bad things he seems cool :O
[2:00:00] <+Fabpsi_> stories and legends are always nice
[2:00:00] <Parapattern> Mythology is fuckin cool as hell
[2:00:01] <mr_saturday93> LUL
[2:00:04] <@TheYellowcouch> Since Rome
[2:00:05] <+Fabpsi_> never gonna die out
[2:00:05] <derap41> Since the Renisance
[2:00:06] <%Ipsenscastle> since ancient rome
[2:00:08] <1matheuw> hades and persephone are a pretty okay couple all things considered
[2:00:09] <dukenux> since it fell
[2:00:11] <+BoomerTiro> Since roughly AD 300
[2:00:11] <%Sigma_190_Beta> Nah, like year 1.
[2:00:13] <%joodatious> rome was birthed by mythology
[2:00:13] <Kingjoker310> long time
[2:00:13] <%AzureGale> See: Norse mythology and literally every Japanese RPG ever
[2:00:14] <derap41> Since the Renaissance
[2:00:18] <Pookiedaexzile> Rome was the First Anime
[2:00:19] <+redthebaron> since people got it back from the whole dark ages
[2:00:21] <+tempestzephyr> forever
[2:00:22] <PettyFunk> It never stopped
[2:00:22] <ExpressNode> Centuries
[2:00:22] <%moonmintparadise> aaaaaaall the time ???
[2:00:23] <commanderapathy> since the goddamn dawn of time
[2:00:23] <%bassoontyphoon> Since Rome
[2:00:24] <+rdark_ksu> Since it was current
[2:00:29] <%MidnightBurst12> since rome was built
[2:00:31] <+ReallyBigRocks> People have been obsessed with mythology since the mythology was created. Thats what mythology is
[2:00:33] <%baka_sugoi> D R A M A
[2:00:33] <1matheuw> dont lie to me pat
[2:00:38] <%Puhff> If it isn't a Marvel movie, it's news to these people.
[2:00:40] <draca23> Even modern games take HEAVY inspiration from myth.
[2:00:40] <%Piemen99> @MistyMntns Cause humans have been the same since our beginnings, and we like imagining shit like this
[2:00:41] <%Sigma_190_Beta> Rome has been a setting from like the time it fell/was built @PatStaresAt
[2:00:44] <Tomschiii> i wonder why agypt stuff is so "rare"
[2:00:44] <+Ondartyr> Would've been difficult to say that while being stabbed many times
[2:00:45] <%Ziegsy> No, pat, youre wrong. Its a line from the genie in aladdin
[2:00:51] <stantheman_97> people have been using religion in stories since writing was first used to make stories
[2:00:52] <Mattais88> Even before Rome people were making stories about Babylon
[2:00:52] <@TheYellowcouch> Also hey. you know what's really rad right now? not making stories about *current year*
[2:00:53] <@MistyMntns> Yes I know that but recently every other media that I see is more obsessed with it.
[2:00:56] <%AzureGale> Is there a JRPG that DOESN'T make a mention of a world tree at all
[2:00:56] <studleydoorite> yeah the real quote is "what the FUCK bruce!?"
[2:00:56] <$KnivesEve> no he did say that you cant tell me anyway else
[2:00:57] <Calamity2007> All culture is just mythology fanfiction
[2:01:04] <%Ipsenscastle> @Ziegsy you're a criminal
[2:01:05] <+TheNommad> S T O I C
[2:01:10] <+Bluemanzee> To be fair Rome still technically existed in the 1400s
[2:01:13] <%bassoontyphoon> Ceaser last words were probably more like “Ah Fuck Ah Shit”
[2:01:15] <Pookiedaexzile> All Culture is Fanfiction
[2:01:17] <%joodatious> daily reminded that ancient rome committed ritual sacrifice all the time. Ceaser himself had children sacrificed
[2:01:18] <SpaceManHotepIV> stoi boi
[2:01:20] <sightlesspoem> shake the tree, see what falls out
[2:01:22] <%Ziegsy> @Ipsenscastle see anyone turn to gold? Clearly im not
[2:01:25] <Teyaric> Seriously, though, Horatius' voice actor is goddamn killing it here. That's a raspy, tired soldier-man-and-a-half
[2:01:26] <+Fabpsi_> *draws sword and kills you*
[2:01:30] <+ReallyBigRocks> @Bluemanzee to be fair, Rome still exists
[2:01:30] <1matheuw> kinda sus this guy
[2:01:30] <%Ipsenscastle> @MistyMntns this particular game is a remake of a skyrim mod
[2:01:32] <%Dakuu75> they had straws in this time?
[2:01:33] <sightlesspoem> go back in there and raise some lumps
[2:01:34] <%Piemen99> @bassoontyphoon LUL

[2:01:45] <+Bluemanzee> @ReallyBigRocks I meant the Eastern Roman Empire
[2:01:46] <+Fabpsi_> OH, now you can
[2:01:47] <+Fabpsi_> interesting
[2:02:07] <$KnivesEve> so is pat's character isekai'ed or just a foreigner?
[2:02:08] <sightlesspoem> listen sentius whos the time traveller here?
[2:02:14] <%AzureGale> How much does this dude know
[2:02:19] <sightlesspoem> isekai
[2:02:21] <dukenux> Sure, blame the dead guy

[2:02:51] <+vexion_smh> ???
[2:02:52] <@TheYellowcouch> I love this man immediately
[2:02:53] <Pookiedaexzile> Look at his form
[2:02:55] <+Fabpsi_> Oi, ain't that a cheeky little roman cunt down there?!
[2:03:01] <Pookiedaexzile> This man is strict
[2:03:04] <Explodincatz> all of these Romans are gamers out of their time
[2:03:05] <@MistyMntns> Its just recently there had been more of a spotlight on it. Hades the game, hadestown the musical, Lore Olympus the web comic. TONS of books just recently released.
[2:03:05] <+Fabpsi_> favorite npc right there
[2:03:10] <sightlesspoem> i wonder why you can examine all the ink jars
[2:03:11] <2Bs_USB_port> is this based on that skyrim mod?
[2:03:12] <%Ziegsy> PAT HE CALLED YOU A POOP
[2:03:17] <%Bailey__gaming> this guy is RIIIICH
[2:03:19] <@MistyMntns> Everyone is so obsessed with hades right now.
[2:03:19] <+TheNommad> It's called a building Pat, people live in thm
[2:03:34] <+chaumiester> What game is this.....
[2:03:36] <%AzureGale> I know why he does push-ups all the time, it's so that he can look up
[2:03:46] <dukenux> aka Athena
[2:03:50] <Calamity2007> I like how this is following Roman times, I feel it makes the story fit better with that than with the Elder Scrolls setting
[2:03:52] <+ReallyBigRocks> sick bust
[2:03:58] <+TheNommad> @chaumiester read stream title maybe?
[2:04:00] <%Bailey__gaming> gotta rotate the object for the shield key pat
[2:04:01] <+vexion_smh> I fucking thought that sculpture is gonna turn her head and talk
[2:04:01] <sirrice77> @MistyMntns Besides the Hades game, what are you talking about/
[2:04:03] <commanderapathy> @mistymntns and that's a bad thing?
[2:04:03] <Ner234> Fire hot. Check
[2:04:06] <%Garthunox> I got here late, whats the premise of this game?
[2:04:09] <%AzureGale> Also Hades came out on Xbox and PS4 like yesterday
[2:04:13] <+Fabpsi_> talk to both at the same time
[2:04:16] <%chiluzza> my personal reason i think it is is the dude is big into survival horror so he must know something is important
[2:04:18] <%greasypete00> also why does it look kinda beaten up in ancient Rome when it was made
[2:04:20] <Pookiedaexzile> Aka Owl Skull Burster
[2:04:22] <%AzureGale> @Garthunox Groundhog Day but Rome
[2:04:26] <+Fabpsi_> what....was she doing there?
[2:04:29] <sightlesspoem> its her shes the sinner
[2:04:33] <+Mrbaconator> pat did you know rats swimming is sn ancient roman myrh because rats can not swim
[2:04:40] <@ssjklyco> Don't sin but also groundhogs day
[2:04:40] <%Bailey__gaming> was she called Lootcratia?
[2:04:45] <%Puhff> @MistyMntns probably because Greek mythology is the most popularized and well preserved of the ancient world religions. Norse being a close second.
[2:04:46] <%Ipsenscastle> Did anyone play the Sexy Brutale? I just realised this is kind of reminding me of that too
[2:04:49] <Calamity2007> @Garthunox This was also originally a Skyrim mod where this was a lost Dwarven City originally
[2:04:57] <Coystick> Dat middleware facial animation
[2:04:58] <@MistyMntns> @commanderapathy I'm not saying it is a bad thing. Just pointing things out.
[2:05:07] <+TheNommad> @Mrbaconator rats can definitely swim dude
[2:05:14] <%Ziegsy> That music bit, with the lady singing? makes me think its gonna burst into the eulmore theme

[2:28:35] <+redthebaron> is it you did not make the building fall on him
[2:28:35] <funnyfunnykid> Is it murder if you didn't cause the building to crash?
[2:28:36] <+tempestzephyr> I mean "you" didn't kill him

[2:28:47] <Pookiedaexzile> He could have looked
[2:28:47] <dekkitout> I bet he's a Thalmor in Skyrim
[2:28:49] <%Sigma_190_Beta> How are you breaking the rules. You just lied.
[2:28:49] <%VictorVonLouche> But how do you know it will collapse?
[2:28:50] <Yakobro> you didn't MAKE him go in there
[2:28:55] <+mattiabh> oh noooo

[2:29:06] <%baka_sugoi> LUL
[2:29:08] <MechanizedGentleman> did he even get hit by anything?
[2:29:08] <scrumbotime> its not stealing if they die
[2:29:09] <%Sotetsu> Gottem

[2:29:10] <%Bailey__gaming> lol Assasanis cant read

[2:29:11] <jabroni_mike_official> it didnt count LUL
[2:29:11] <+ReallyBigRocks> HE didn't get hit by a single piece of debris
[2:29:11] <+Fabpsi_> nooooo problem
[2:29:12] <funnyfunnykid> LMFAO
[2:29:14] <%NateyBeak> NOT murder and NOT theft
[2:29:17] <%HoldBtoRun> lol he didnt even get hit?
[2:29:18] <DSD24> So now you get to be a Stealth Archer
[2:29:19] <karismaticprik> it's nto stealing if he's dead
[2:29:20] <+MisterAvry> is that a bounty notice for your head? yeah self defense AF
[2:29:20] <%baka_sugoi> baited
[2:29:20] <Enajy314> LUL
[2:29:21] <Pookiedaexzile> Shoulda checked the foundation
[2:29:21] <%AzureGale> Did he even get hit by the debris
[2:29:22] <$KnivesEve> Emperor Umu
[2:29:23] <+mattiabh> he barely got hit
[2:29:24] <studleydoorite> that was like a stage play LUL
[2:29:25] <+TheBitingIrish> A whole penny
[2:29:25] <goddamndavid> 1 full money
[2:29:25] <+ReallyBigRocks> The surprise is what killed him
[2:29:26] <Ner234> OR THEFT
[2:29:26] <%blastyoboots> blackmail malleolus w/ bounty thing
[2:29:26] <+redthebaron> accidents don't count
[2:29:29] <scrumbotime> oh so he had a coin on him as well, probably his payment for the job
[2:29:30] <%HoldBtoRun> man died by observation
[2:29:30] <kiwicoffin> Just looting a random corpse
[2:29:31] <+BoomerTiro> Oh man, show him bounty order on next loop and team up with him!
[2:29:32] <%baka_sugoi> UmU
[2:29:34] <+CabbyDM> it scared him to death
[2:29:35] <goddamndavid> is it stealing if they're dead?
[2:29:36] <%HotSauceFiend> HITMAN rules=Accidental Kill
[2:29:36] <%Valdorick> Nature killed him, and dead men have no property rights.
[2:29:38] <DSD24> Emperor Umu and her 6 costumes
[2:29:38] <%Caped_Eggy> He's dead, it's free real estate
[2:29:39] <Charlie99993> UMU
[2:29:41] <%Bailey__gaming> Sick Lootin isnt theft
[2:29:41] <Pookiedaexzile> He should have checked the structure he was in
[2:29:41] <%Ne1son> Yeah duh rocks killed him. And you cant steal from the dead @PatStaresAt
[2:29:41] <%VictorVonLouche> You heard it here GRAVE ROBBERY IS NOT A SIN
[2:29:41] <+Fabpsi_> God looking at you doing that shit "Oh...well...this *was* kinda clever, so you are good this time"
[2:29:44] <%Puhff> 1 down, 1999 to go!
[2:29:45] <@TheYellowcouch> He's just sleeping
[2:29:47] <chaosbringer28> indirect murder might be good then
[2:29:47] <%SmolBluGhost> "Accidental" murder LUL
[2:29:48] <+puffinup> TWO THOUSAND CASH BRO
[2:29:50] <Pookiedaexzile> Its not the Buildings fault
[2:29:51] <+HuoShengdi> Everyone enters here with 1 denarius
[2:29:53] <DSD24> Padoru Parodru
[2:29:53] <topiodonk> this looks wonky but time loops are always cool
[2:29:54] <@TheYellowcouch> and you'll give it back tomorrow
[2:29:59] <%Puhff> fuck off
[2:30:01] <%Dakuu75> now do that 2,000 more times to pay off their debt
[2:30:08] <dekkitout> I sense a hustle
[2:30:10] <tubit> Lots of misadventure in the military
[2:30:13] <%baka_sugoi> UmU UmU UmU
[2:30:18] <Explodincatz> im loving this game
[2:30:20] <+TheNommad> how tf does he know that
[2:30:21] <hitaker> yeah wait how tf does he know
[2:30:24] <@ssjklyco> Does he know the loop?
[2:30:25] <%Meekest> Yeah how could he know that
[2:30:25] <%Bailey__gaming> Magic Arrows?
[2:30:25] <+Fabpsi_> is...is he also timetraveling and remembering stuff?
[2:30:27] <%Bailey__gaming> hmmm
[2:30:28] <@TheYellowcouch> The plot thickens
[2:30:30] <%Valdorick> HARVEST THE GOLD CORPSES FOR 2000 DOLLARS
[2:30:33] <Pookiedaexzile> Wait a second
[2:30:35] <goddamndavid> he probably didnt but tricked you maybe?
[2:30:40] <Kingjoker310> i think he time travels as well
[2:30:40] <@commanderclaw> That's not how markets work!
[2:30:40] <+Fabpsi_> he can't know the loop, he would be the boss of this place if he knew about it
[2:30:44] <hitaker> another time traveler??? that would be sick
[2:30:46] <kiwicoffin> Maybe he knows more than he says
[2:30:46] <+ReallyBigRocks> There's nothing else to learn from that fable
[2:30:47] <%SmolBluGhost> This greedy dood
[2:30:50] <+ReallyBigRocks> Just wealth
[2:30:53] <dekkitout> What are you, Mansa Musa?
[2:30:54] <dukenux> we're talking inflation
[2:30:55] <hitaker> but dont let it be this nerd
[2:30:56] <@commanderclaw> If you create a fuckton of gold out of nothing the value will drop!
[2:31:01] <Sunstalker> The gold would devalue D:
[2:31:04] <%Treasure_Vault> I dunno Patches, how can I trust you?
[2:31:04] <Yakobro> LUL
[2:31:05] <MechanizedGentleman> how you gonna pick up an arrow that turns you to gold, smart guy?
[2:31:07] <%HairballCT> LUL
[2:31:07] <%bassoontyphoon> And crash all economies
[2:31:10] <+puffinup> LMAO
[2:31:13] <@ssjklyco> Actually, it would just decrease the value cause if everything is gold, then nothing is gold
[2:31:14] <ape_hawk> @commanderclaw yup
[2:31:15] <%LouieRouie> That's not how wealth works
[2:31:17] <+Fabpsi_> desius even said before that "inflation" is a problem here.
[2:31:19] <+TheNommad> infinite gold would mean gold would be worthless
[2:31:21] <+Fabpsi_> So this is not gonna help
[2:31:22] <+mattiabh> wait, is this the same voice actor for Patches?
[2:31:23] <DianaTheAscian> Huh?
[2:31:24] <tanarath> 'Without the drawbacks'
[2:31:25] <Parapattern> There are a lot of stories with Diana
[2:31:27] <1matheuw> so artemis?
[2:31:27] <+ReallyBigRocks> Diana was a princess idiot
[2:31:34] <Pookiedaexzile> this is Hades
[2:31:36] <%Sigma_190_Beta> @PatStaresAt Diana is roman Artemis.
[2:31:37] <%DashXero> Oh. Thigh chick from Hades...
[2:31:38] <studleydoorite> da undawaud
[2:31:39] <Parapattern> Diana, the best goddess
[2:31:42] <+Bluemanzee> Unless you control the supply of gold like De Beers
[2:31:46] <%Bailey__gaming> And the arrows make your Stands even sicker
[2:31:46] <%Pappajimbo> No it make gold wortless inflation man
[2:31:50] <%DashXero> Artemis
[2:31:58] <PettyFunk> Diana is Artemis, yeah?
[2:32:02] <%NeonPopT> NeonPopT subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months! how's the game so far? would you recommend?
[2:32:06] <%Puhff> a pizza?
[2:32:09] <MoonKing> Is that patches
[2:32:10] <%Valdorick> This is just theft with extra steps!
[2:32:11] <ExpressNode> "I won't be dead"
[2:32:18] <MechanizedGentleman> sounds like theft to me, buddy
[2:32:18] <sightlesspoem> gods cant see in the dark LUL
[2:32:21] <Louie_Salmon> Man someone made this game because they wanted to nerd out about old mythology, and I respect that.
[2:32:21] <%GeneralSCPatton> That is a fucking gamble
[2:32:22] <1matheuw> this is not gonna work for sure
[2:32:24] <%vandastelka> true
[2:32:24] <+tempestzephyr> that's theft
[2:32:25] <sirrice77> It wouldn't make the gold worthless if he was careful with how much gold he generated
[2:32:27] <%justcallmebobplease> Under the cover of darkness and OUTSIDE THE FOV CONE of the statues, perhaps?
[2:32:28] <+puffinup> YEYEYE
[2:32:28] <%Treasure_Vault> Alright idiot, let's do this
[2:32:29] <+mattiabh> resident evil shotgun swap
[2:32:33] <dekkitout> AND WHERE'S JA?
[2:32:33] <@TheYellowcouch> I mean every loophole has worked so far so
[2:32:36] <Kingjoker310> 100% fail for sure
[2:32:38] <Specularii> This man is a GENIUS
[2:32:38] <Parapattern> Sins aren't sins if you do them in the dark
[2:32:38] <+probably_facetious> Trade without permission. Yup.
[2:32:42] <+Fabpsi_> if that is theft, what you did 6min ago was "murder"
[2:32:47] <+tempestzephyr> he's more of a slaveryman
[2:32:49] <MechanizedGentleman> Prometheus got fucked up bro
[2:32:53] <brunoberserk> so this is a total overall skyrim mod ?
[2:32:53] <%kingofasgard> yes
[2:32:57] <kiwicoffin> Dumbass gods
[2:32:59] <+ReallyBigRocks> You're just like Prometheus dude, just like him
[2:33:03] <+gespenst25> Oh they can't see you if it's dark
[2:33:07] <%CalderGaming> i have an idea about what counts as breaking the rule but i'll keep it private
[2:33:08] <%Valdorick> The Gods' one weakness... The cover of darkness.
[2:33:09] <+Fabpsi_> interesting TIP
[2:33:10] <Yakobro> LUL
[2:33:10] <+skylerpilot> gods can't see in the dark, duh
[2:33:17] <%DashXero> Wait a second. This guy's plan is stupid. If gold becomes infinite, it becomes worthless.
[2:33:17] <1matheuw> thats a nice pop up
[2:33:20] <%Piemen99> You son of a bitch Im in
[2:33:20] <topiodonk> silly prometheus
[2:33:21] <Twistedwolfie> Lmao this game is awesome
[2:33:21] <sirrice77> @brunoberserk No it was once a mod but then they remade the mod in unreal engine
[2:33:21] <dekkitout> Got caught? It was very obvious the culprit was Prometheus...
[2:33:25] <%coward_man> what if he called you pard'ner with a cowboy accent?
[2:33:32] <%Puhff> huh...
[2:33:33] <+ReallyBigRocks> looks kinda small ngl
[2:33:36] <%vandastelka> close enough
[2:33:38] <Parapattern> Dude, Diana can and WILL fuck you up
[2:33:44] <%Treasure_Vault> When does he kick you down a cliff?
[2:33:54] <%Valdorick> if the gods are watching... wouldn't they have heard your dumb ass idea?
[2:33:54] <%Ziegsy> how come that gold statue had a toga?
[2:33:56] <scrumbotime> may the gods see fuck all so you can do big crimes
[2:33:59] <+charm_quark_> Diana gonna gank you bro
[2:34:01] <+Fabpsi_> the BEES

[2:34:13] <kiwicoffin> @DashXero that's pretty much the lesson of the whole goose fable. Attempting infinite value only destroys it
[2:34:13] <%Ipsenscastle> NOT THE BEES
[2:34:15] <studleydoorite> some sort of bee cult jermaOld
[2:34:16] <Zudrag> just a casual wasp nest in a temple of a god

[2:37:23] <Explodincatz> dont worry guys gold can swim
[2:37:26] <%VictorVonLouche> you can put it down lol
[2:37:28] <kiwicoffin> does gold algae keep the same density?
[2:37:31] <%Ipsenscastle> Galatea. Huh.
[2:37:34] <dukenux> congrats, all those denari you found are worthless
[2:37:35] <%joodatious> pat you're ruining the economy
[2:37:37] <MacMog> free skeleton, and surely somebody would buy it off you
[2:37:39] <+TheNommad> silver prices will skyrocket!
[2:37:42] <ExpressNode> I guess you're Midas and you can turn everything into gold
[2:37:48] <%bread_assassin> My one problem is that I wish the game just almost immediately gives you the answer to the puzzles.
[2:38:00] <Sunstalker> It wouldnt sink if it's wedged into the rock?
[2:38:01] <%baka_sugoi> sbfpSetIn WutFace
[2:38:11] <@Jekado> wouldn't gold be worst for a bridge?
[2:38:25] <goldenwerewolf> Pat please shoot the floor and kill all life on earth
[2:38:30] <%kingofasgard> magic gold
[2:38:31] <DSD24> Is your character just a normal dood
[2:38:31] <hitaker> better than leaves tho
[2:38:32] <Pookiedaexzile> NETPICKER?
[2:38:36] <Mobilebeardunit> psaSkelmo psaSkelmo psaSkelmo
[2:38:36] <sightlesspoem> egypt?
[2:38:37] <+Fabpsi_> maybe not for a bridge, but as a climbable object?
[2:38:37] <%HotSauceFiend> do you have limited arrows?
[2:38:37] <%Ipsenscastle> @Jekado shhhhh
[2:38:37] <%Shubreaker> that shit would tear your hands apart
[2:38:38] <+Fabpsi_> maybe
[2:38:41] <Sunstalker> Shoot the sun PogChamp
[2:38:42] <%TrafficCohen> OOF
[2:38:43] <DragonBornKing> @bread_assassin yeah its kinda dumb when the game whispers to you 3 seconds f=after a puzzle starts
[2:38:45] <%cade_calrayn> wouldn't that hurt like a fucking lot to climb golden ivy?
[2:38:49] <%NateyBeak> NOW GO BACK AND SHOOT THAT GUY
[2:38:49] <ExpressNode> Oh fuck that was scary
[2:38:50] <Chaossheep> is this the white hallway or nah
[2:38:51] <%Retinolgaming> The statues are following you with their gaze
[2:38:58] <dekkitout> Oh yeah, Kurzgesagt has a video on what could happen if you turned things into gold
[2:39:03] <+ShitLord> you can now quit your job and live stinking rich forever
[2:39:09] <%moonmintparadise> so turning someone into gold is NOT MURDER, Pat
[2:39:09] <hitaker> Please turn Patches into gold
[2:39:11] <Gorshum> The white hallway
[2:39:13] <%NateyBeak> wait yea, what IS the white hallway?
[2:39:17] <MechanizedGentleman> what if you shoot a statue?
[2:39:20] <+pectusumbra> So you're saying IT DOESN'T COUNT
[2:39:20] <@MistyMntns> This is the hallway I believe
[2:39:21] <%Treasure_Vault> White hallway, huh?
[2:39:23] <Chaossheep> cade_calrayn gold is fairly soft so probably not, but the ivy would fall off the wall super hard
[2:39:24] <%baka_sugoi> dang
[2:39:25] <1matheuw> TURN THE MFER INTO GOLD
[2:39:28] <@Jekado> @MechanizedGentleman double gold.
[2:39:29] <+Fabpsi_> the people inside the gold things are still alive
[2:39:31] <+ReallyBigRocks> double gold
[2:39:31] <+Fabpsi_> so it is not murder
[2:39:32] <%Ipsenscastle> clonk
[2:39:35] <goldenwerewolf> You need the fire arrows for that, Pat
[2:39:38] <%zuzuxiv> damn i wanna see more of this
[2:39:40] <+RelikaNox> I thought the white hallway was something else near the very end
[2:39:43] <%AzureGale> Oh that's cool
[2:39:45] <+RelikaNox> but idk
[2:39:46] <hitaker> dont waste arrows my boy
[2:39:46] <dukenux> that helped
[2:39:50] <goddamndavid> wont it only get heavier?
[2:39:52] <+FoolsArcade> Can you turn the fire to gold???
[2:39:58] <DragonBornKing> is that the hall way?
[2:39:58] <%bread_assassin> White hallway is later.
[2:40:00] <sightlesspoem> aww
[2:40:01] <+ReallyBigRocks> Does that effect happen on every surface?
[2:40:03] <Parapattern> This game is dope
[2:40:05] <+Fabpsi_> Will you play it again in the future?
[2:40:05] <+FoolsArcade> awh man
[2:40:06] <%Ipsenscastle> Thanks Pat, this was great
[2:40:06] <dukenux> Aww
[2:40:07] <Zudrag> white hallway is way later
[2:40:08] <@TheYellowcouch> Yeah that's a good stopping point

[2:40:13] <%vandastelka> aww oh well

[2:40:17] <sauceboss310> sugoiDansuhyper sugoiDansuhyper
[2:40:18] <ToneBacas> i do think it's cool

[2:40:29] <%bassoontyphoon> Super neat game!
[2:40:30] <sightlesspoem> boo
[2:40:31] <+Devilbringer814> Tiny girl with stand powers time
[2:40:32] <%Agami23> im gonna grab that game for sure. that was rad as shit
[2:40:32] <+Mordexai_> Ah gotcha
[2:40:33] <chimeraxmachina> Awww yeahhh
[2:40:35] <sightlesspoem> last game
[2:40:35] <%SovPho> the forgotten city rightt
[2:40:35] <1matheuw> andre lilies?
[2:40:38] <ape_hawk> also, its a good stopping point
[2:40:43] <%vandastelka> ender lillies is great
[2:40:43] <tanarath> This game is GREAT
[2:40:45] <@SoFarFetched> he's gonna grab a piss
[2:40:46] <Chaossheep> @SovPho the forgotten city
[2:40:49] <%AzureGale> Don't worry folks he's still playing games for a little while longer
[2:40:52] <%SovPho> 25 denari what
[2:40:56] <%Puhff> i dont get it
[2:40:59] <%SovPho> wishlist for sales
[2:41:03] <%Ziegsy> @1matheuw isnt he playing knuckles?
[2:41:14] <stantheman_97> it started off meh but seeing the dialog post-loop got me interested
[2:41:16] <topiodonk> reminds me of pathologic
[2:41:18] <Tomschiii> idk but ender looks so generic in what it does. like this type of indie game comes out every month
[2:41:25] <%Ziegsy> @SoFarFetched TBF unless they sit, guys have to grab the piss. so I have been told
[2:41:35] <+mattiabh> pathalogic has a lot more going on tbh
[2:41:35] <PettyFunk> I still haven't played Ender Lillies, but the vibe I get is like halfway between Momodora and Salt&Sanctuary. I liked the former but didn't like the latter so no idea if it's for me
[2:41:37] <DragonBornKing> another 2d soulslike metroidvania BrokeBack
[2:42:07] <%Ipsenscastle> @Ziegsy we have to cup our hands, it's a whole thing
[2:42:19] <%SovPho> @PettyFunk any game that looks like it was animated in Pivot isn't worth your time
[2:42:23] <Tomschiii> @PettyFunk what, you didnt like s&s?
[2:42:51] <%SovPho> salt and sanctuary was lame
[2:43:14] <%joodatious> salt&sanctuary ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper
[2:43:17] <Tomschiii> it was a blast, espeically with a friend
[2:43:22] <ExpressNode> I loved Momodora
[2:43:22] <StarlitStunner> oooooh we got an opinion baby
[2:43:23] <%AzureGale> nyannHypers nyannHypers nyannHypers nyannHypers nyannHypers
[2:43:24] <topiodonk> s&s was ok
[2:43:26] <Minorou> salt and sanctuary was fine
[2:43:29] <%Ziegsy> @Ipsenscastle ah, the true midas touch
[2:43:29] <+mattiabh> ender lilies is quality, way better than salt and sanctuary, blasphemous and most recent metroivanias
[2:43:36] <%LeiaSkynoober> Momodora is rad
[2:43:45] <Minorou> we need more momodora love
[2:43:46] <%AzureGale> Momodora is cool
[2:43:52] <%AzureGale> Kaho is adorbs :3
[2:43:57] <%Evitron1> blasphemous was good evitroPensive
[2:44:03] <+Devilbringer814> Ender Lilies music is great too, especially "Harmonious"
[2:44:12] <PettyFunk> @Tomschiii Not personally, I was put off by the art direction and nothing struck me as too interesting. Which is weird because I love a lot of games that are very similar
[2:44:19] <ExpressNode> I bought Blasphemous but I never had a chance to try it out
[2:44:24] <Tomschiii> nah, blasphemous only had style, sadly :/
[2:44:47] <%AzureGale> CALLED OUT
[2:44:49] <%vandastelka> it is

[2:45:20] <Sunstalker> Blasphemous with it's upgrade is amazing. though FUCK that one boss, the fucker
[2:45:22] <PettyFunk> It was mostly a diffiulty barrier that kept me out of latter Blasphemous
[2:45:24] <+battle_of_the_meat> and so is the dog
[2:45:26] <@SoFarFetched> I wish to pet him
[2:45:26] <Chaossheep> that dog is almos as big as pat now

[2:45:44] <%Zero_Jacks> zyzxGRASP PET
[2:45:44] <%VictorVonLouche> @Devilbringer814 Harmonious only gets better as you progress the game without changing a thing lol
[2:45:46] <%kingofasgard> the problem with blasphemous is that it exists in a post-hollow knight world and that's not fair on it
[2:45:52] <%Puhff> oh he sleepy
[2:45:53] <+MisterAvry> it's like you're friends with a pile of Ed Gein's dirty laundry
[2:45:56] <PettyFunk> :)

[2:46:00] <%BlackStarAura> Beautiful boy
[2:46:02] <Chaossheep> also blasphemous was excellent and ender lillies is also p. neat

[2:47:46] <@MistyMntns> Favorite game, No Signal
[2:47:49] <+D00msDayDan> ! signal loss !
[2:47:50] <+MisterAvry> Yay No Signal!
[2:47:50] <%VictorVonLouche> It needs more eyes on it.
[2:47:52] <%AzureGale> Ender Lilies: No Signal
[2:47:56] <+vexion_smh> ohhhh
[2:47:58] <+Grayhammatter> no signal, best game

[2:48:02] <+Midashu> We get signal, main screen turn on
[2:48:04] <Profmcstevie> That's not black
[2:48:10] <%kingofasgard> wow that's a hollow knight right away
[2:48:11] <%HairballCT> peepo detuneV
[2:48:11] <+MisterAvry> Ender Lillies: Quietus of the No Signal
[2:48:11] <%AzureGale> btw you spelled "Lillies" wrong on the thing
[2:48:14] <PettyFunk> I think one of my big problems is comparing a lot of 2D Metroidvanias/Soulslikes to Hollow Knight and that's supremely unfair to all other games
[2:48:16] <topiodonk> that gray
[2:48:16] <+Grayhammatter> wuzzau
[2:48:20] <tanarath> @patstaresat that's not black
[2:48:22] <+D00msDayDan> thank you money
[2:48:23] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> after following the artist behind this gam,e on twitter for years it feels so weird that they made a game now, but also ayyy
[2:48:40] <@SoFarFetched> no forgotten city for us
[2:48:51] <grimwire1> the music in this is so soothing
[2:48:54] <%RealThiele> time for the worst 2d map ive seen in a long time
[2:48:58] <%vandastelka> to be fair this game needs some more attention
[2:49:28] <@MistyMntns> Whelp. I am going to bail because I need a nap. Chat be Nice, Dont be an asshole, Do good.
[2:49:37] <PettyFunk> I love that the "blahs" were def added by the donator but it sounded like Pat being rude LUL
[2:49:42] <scarman125> @PatStaresAt curious where you stand on this whole Cruise Chaser mount issue.
[2:49:49] <%GeneralSCPatton> I like this game quite a bit. Fell off before I got too far. Need to resume.
[2:49:51] <Jaysky> HungryPaimon
[2:49:59] <%kingofasgard> @PettyFunk i hear you, but if you've got 20ish moneys to spend, would you buy the one everyone raves about or the one which got buried under all the others doing similar things?
[2:50:01] <Tomschiii> @RealThiele truly? the game itself is 2d so how can the map be so terrible?^^
[2:50:02] <%baka_sugoi> IT GOOD GAM
[2:50:14] <+RelikaNox> People frothing at the mouth cause it's a mog station item
[2:50:17] <@SoFarFetched> People dont like it's on Mogstation and 30 bucks apparently.
[2:50:22] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt It's a $30 mount instead of an achievement is what some people have issue with it
[2:50:22] <Teyaric> Thats the forward'n'back one?
[2:50:25] <cherrycottontail> people don't want to pay for it
[2:50:26] <goldenwerewolf> That it's not earnable ingame because it's a raid boss
[2:50:28] <Azathotic> What dumb drama is happening now?
[2:50:30] <scarman125> people are losing their shit about it being a cash shop mount
[2:50:35] <@SoFarFetched> @Teyaric yea it is
[2:50:37] <dekkitout> What's wrong with a bicycle for two?
[2:50:37] <%RealThiele> @RealThiele they try to do layered maps in a 2d space and so its arrows pointiong every which way with no actual bearing on the direction you are supposed to go
[2:50:37] <%monsieurfantastic> monsieurfantastic subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 9 months! Patron!!!! i watched re infinite darkness and black widow both in one day. im never seen two movies that have such little impact to the main stories and do nothing for character development. dont waste your time. stay safe and pet babies❤
[2:50:40] <MechanizedGentleman> I'd rather it be in mogstation than PVP
[2:50:45] <%BioHunter> so glad it wasnt feast
[2:50:48] <goldenwerewolf> People wanted it to be a raid mount from the raid that the raid boss mount it sfrom
[2:50:54] <%SmolBluGhost> i see no issue
[2:50:55] <+Grayhammatter> fuck the feast mount
[2:50:58] <%Puhff> Feast DansGame
[2:51:01] <+TheBitingIrish> FF14 pvp is AAYUSS
[2:51:04] <@Jekado> All i know about the mount is i go backwards and fowards and backwards and fowards and one step foward
[2:51:21] <%NopeBadguy> Maybe hold it for Dragonsong War Ultimate
[2:51:24] <%SmolBluGhost> as i do the raid XD
[2:51:25] <@TheYellowcouch> It was fun how people were mad about it potentially being a feast mount and now they're mad it's not l
[2:51:27] <scarman125> isn't TEA brand new?
[2:51:28] <%Retinolgaming> PVP in ff14 is soooooo bad. It's like reverse warhammer online where the PVE was terrible.
[2:51:34] <%BioHunter> all i know is that the mount is now mine
[2:51:36] <%Ipsenscastle> starting the game nude?
[2:51:37] <scarman125> or is he not in TEA?
[2:51:38] <+KojiColnair> no start it in slot 2
[2:51:40] <@SoFarFetched> Funny thing is I recently did t he Alexander Raid.
[2:51:41] <%NopeBadguy> TEA is like almost two years old
[2:51:43] <+Devilbringer814> I want ng+ in this game
[2:51:44] <%Valdorick> ANIME
[2:51:46] <%RealThiele> I like the game I had fun and 100% ender lillies but its got issues
[2:51:46] <+Grayhammatter> nude?
[2:51:48] <@SoFarFetched> so CC was fresh on me

[2:53:22] <%coward_man> stand name: knights of cydonia
[2:53:29] <+tempestzephyr> little anime girl cowering in fear
[2:53:39] <%Pappajimbo> Muda muda muda

[2:54:14] <%Ne1son> Omg poat staring right at chat
[2:54:15] <stantheman_97> ew bottom right pat
[2:54:18] <ChungusQuest> now small anime girl is running towards the Pat instead of away
[2:54:19] <Allofmytears> the music in this game is pretty good
[2:54:24] <%vandastelka> you have a superman dive
[2:54:25] <%coward_man> @PatStaresAt should make an animation for the transition of your box sliding into each position
[2:54:25] <%DashXero> Do we have i-frames on the Dodge?
[2:54:27] <%Dakuu75> that the dodge "eat shit" lol
[2:54:28] <%baka_sugoi> ok for now
[2:54:30] <+Grayhammatter> map looks... a little jank
[2:54:31] <thackattack00> baby dive
[2:54:31] <+tempestzephyr> face plant dodge roll
[2:54:34] <@SoFarFetched> Im surprised her dress isnt getting more filthy from just shoving herself into the dirt
[2:54:38] <%Ziegsy> when a female au ra chooses dark knight
[2:54:42] <+TheNommad> This is giving me hollow knight vibes for some reason
[2:54:42] <%RealThiele> yes your baby dodge has many iframes
[2:54:44] <%Shubreaker> isn't this more like Order of Ecclesia?
[2:54:51] <ExpressNode> I hope this isn't one of those games where you take fall damage
[2:55:00] <%coward_man> @SoFarFetched but she must be pure innocent child
[2:55:02] <thackattack00> map in this game is great actually, shows you all the exits and tells you when you found all the goodies in the room
[2:55:17] <%vandastelka> red glow is perfect dodge
[2:55:24] <@SoFarFetched> geefPoint look unless you're telling me this is some "Magical" dress that can never get dirty
[2:55:24] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[2:55:45] <%Esparsenior> Pretty game…
[2:55:47] <%Meekest> yo Pat both of the games you've played today are sick
[2:55:48] <%RealThiele> dont worry farfetched they got you covered
[2:55:50] <%Ziegsy> Dress is pure tefflon
[2:55:51] <PettyFunk> Anyone else in chat blighted? :(
[2:55:58] <%coward_man> @SoFarFetched it's magical by the power of childlike innocence
[2:56:01] <@SoFarFetched> cause white clothing is the most easily stained type of clothing geefBruh
[2:56:01] <%Esparsenior> Menu gave me Neil vibes
[2:56:04] <thackattack00> bonfire!
[2:56:10] <%AzureGale> Wow what a concept
[2:56:11] <ExpressNode> @SoFarFetched The stand dry cleans the dress everytime he goes back in
[2:56:16] <+pectusumbra> walked past an item
[2:56:16] <+D00msDayDan> imagine if bando namcai patented that mechanic
[2:56:16] <hakumaribo> MSSED ITEM
[2:56:18] <%Esparsenior> Neir*
[2:56:19] <+pectusumbra> to the left
[2:56:20] <@SoFarFetched> geefGasp
[2:56:21] <%RealThiele> menu lets you homeward bone tho so thats nice
[2:56:25] <linSP> protect the anime from da enemy!
[2:56:26] <@SoFarFetched> well shit that's a handy stand ability
[2:56:27] <+Grayhammatter> missed item
[2:56:32] <revoltingimp> is that stand the Goblin Slayer man?
[2:56:40] <ChungusQuest> was that a secret ledge?
[2:56:41] <%AzureGale> It's stainproof, it's all good
[2:56:43] <%RealThiele> you will miss many items
[2:56:50] <draca23> This seems like Oninaki but better.
[2:56:51] <+Devilbringer814> the homeward bone in the menu was very useful later
[2:56:54] <kikoeru_san> wow this be like some tiny child hollow knight
[2:56:55] <%toastybites> cower in fear little girl
[2:56:55] <%vandastelka> this has hollow knight levels of hidden shit
[2:56:59] <+TurnArklight> blue rooms still have goodies, orange ones are complete
[2:57:06] <%Ziegsy> that only works for paige
[2:57:10] <+CrimsonDio11> the art style of this game reminds me of Child of Light for some reason
[2:57:11] <%coward_man> the enemies are themselves stands so don't goo on the dress
[2:57:11] <%DashXero> Panic Dive.
[2:57:12] <zzNamttamzz> Room color changes when you get everything resi style
[2:57:14] <%GeneralSCPatton> That's totally the hollow flurry attack
[2:57:30] <%RealThiele> anime girl does her nyeh midair
[2:57:43] <+TopTieramisu> OwO attack
[2:57:43] <@SoFarFetched> I KNEW IT
[2:57:44] <%Wallabri> Patton the Mod
[2:57:46] <%Treasure_Vault> become as mod
[2:57:47] <@SoFarFetched> I SAW THE KEYBOARD
[2:57:48] <+MisterAvry> Cute Souls
[2:57:49] <%Ziegsy> here comes the sword
[2:57:50] <%Ipsenscastle> modding Patton
[2:57:51] <%DashXero> Sounds like we have a new mod.
[2:57:51] <%Ne1son> I like the music
[2:57:54] <@GeneralSCPatton> Things are good. Whoa, wait. Mod!? Holy shit. Thanks dude!
[2:57:56] <%Ne1son> very pretty
[2:57:56] <Renkage> Is this Jojo's Darksouls Adventure?
[2:57:59] <dekkitout> Arise mod
[2:58:01] <intylerwe_trust> What’s up Pat
[2:58:08] <StarlitStunner> so much power
[2:58:12] <%AzureGale> OH SNAP
[2:58:14] <+Grayhammatter> arise mod!
[2:58:16] <%Valdorick> Spoiler - the thing on the back of a car.
[2:58:16] <%RealThiele> oops, all mods
[2:58:20] <%Valdorick> Kappa
[2:58:21] <%AzureGale> With great power etc.
[2:58:21] <+ReallyBigRocks> The Moderators Curse
[2:58:24] <Ner234> Ascend!
[2:58:24] <%masterfire23> spoilers
[2:58:25] <%kingofasgard> but patton's got tanks, he'll do fine
[2:58:26] <+MisterAvry> heavy is the head that wears the crown
[2:58:28] <%Esparsenior> It’s like Knighting someone…
[2:58:30] <%Sigma_190_Beta> Mod everyone.
[2:58:31] <zanzibarian_hamster> When will the influence of dark souls finally peter out? Every second game has dark souls influences these days
[2:58:32] <Dakuu75> does that mean the mods need to spoil themselves to KNOW what spoilers are?
[2:58:34] <@TheYellowcouch> Welcome to the anti spoiler brigade
[2:58:34] <draca23> Or just banning if you feel like it
[2:58:34] <%Shubreaker> "responsibility" he says
[2:58:34] <@Lion_kun> Only for spoilers and nothing else.
[2:58:35] <TheEmperorsEyebrows> shoudl we point out secrets?
[2:58:38] <+D00msDayDan> if everyone's a mod then no one is
[2:58:39] <revoltingimp> Vader is Luke's father
[2:58:41] <BigColossus> Jesús died in the bible
[2:58:43] <MechanizedGentleman> wow that little girl has strong ankles
[2:58:43] <+FoolsArcade> never
[2:58:43] <+TheBitingIrish> NEVER
[2:58:43] <grimwire1> never
[2:58:44] <+ReallyBigRocks> Ban the entire chat pls
[2:58:44] <@GeneralSCPatton> Now I'm a mod for 3 streamers. Neat.
[2:58:44] <stantheman_97> now ban all of chat
[2:58:45] <%vandastelka> never
[2:58:46] <hakumaribo> fucking never
[2:58:47] <%Treasure_Vault> when something better comes along
[2:58:47] <%SovPho> never
[2:58:47] <ChungusQuest> she got some strong leg bones
[2:58:48] <%VictorVonLouche> never
[2:58:48] <+MisterAvry> NEVER
[2:58:48] <%Meekest> You mean the influence of Berserk
[2:58:49] <scarman125> no body every thinks of the poor mods who get spoiled on every game ever
[2:58:49] <linSP> I hope woolie mods a tyrant someday, he needs one
[2:58:49] <%Agami23> the same time the influence of zelda does
[2:58:50] <@Lion_kun> Why would you want it to?
[2:58:53] <%AzureGale> "Wait, it's all mods?" "Always has been"
[2:58:54] <PettyFunk> The nice thing is assholes tend to draw a lot of attention to themselves
[2:58:54] <+MisterAvry> hopefully never
[2:58:56] <+Grayhammatter> never
[2:58:56] <Tracazoid> Only if From ends up Blizzarding themselves up
[2:59:00] <%SovPho> "When will this GOOD THING die out?"
[2:59:01] <ExpressNode> When we have another video game crash
[2:59:02] <+Ne1son> All things will become as souls
[2:59:02] <%Agami23> oh and the same time as mario
[2:59:03] <+TopTieramisu> dark souls is the dark souls of influential games
[2:59:03] <%baka_sugoi> this is more metro then any
[2:59:03] <draca23> When something bigger comes along.
[2:59:03] <%Sigma_190_Beta> Never, because Berserk will influence verything.
[2:59:06] <Teyaric> About the same time we all collectively forget Mario, Doom, Metroid, Castlevania, Half Life, and so on.
[2:59:06] <%RealThiele> dark souls influence unlikely to fade, espcecially with elden ring soon
[2:59:06] <retrosadness> dark souls changed games like forever
[2:59:07] <+0dinpen> reminds me of re4's impact
[2:59:08] <@Lion_kun> It's so much better than the call of duty phase.
[2:59:13] <Ner234> Oops all Dark Sould
[2:59:14] <ExpressNode> Because of too many dark souls
[2:59:14] <@SoFarFetched> @Dakuu75 yeah sometimes it be like that. Mods can check if something is a spoiler,or if they know the knowledge of the game already.
[2:59:16] <Lancaster_H> dude this looks real smooth
[2:59:16] <%Ipsenscastle> It'll kind of proliferate and branch out into new things over time
[2:59:18] <Zeemod155> The influence of Mario would peter out sooner
[2:59:19] <+pectusumbra> and dark souls overall is very archetypal itself
[2:59:21] <stantheman_97> i feel like soulsborne is here to stay
[2:59:23] <%VictorVonLouche> might want to pray again
[2:59:23] <%coward_man> DS1 is still a great game
[2:59:24] <StarlitStunner> If only we were in the Armored Core timeline instead
[2:59:25] <%ElkRiverDog> Right after Berserk stops being the model for Dark Knight
[2:59:26] <%pilgrimsayswhat> "when will Mario's influence peter out"
[2:59:27] <@Lion_kun> Or the arkham asylum phase.
[2:59:28] <+Ondartyr> It's basically at the level of metroidvanias by now. Which also explains the many combinations with those.
[2:59:30] <%Deano8817> when will doom stop influencing all these dooms clones? I want something new :)
[2:59:43] <+0dinpen> @Lion_kun re4 had a big impact too
[2:59:51] <Afterman_> thought that said the polish way
[2:59:52] <%Esparsenior> Dark Souls did a lot for games. Like the first 2 MGS games or Disco Elysium for writing
[2:59:52] <@GeneralSCPatton> psaDab psaDab psaDab psaBougie
[2:59:52] <%RealThiele> yellow meter on monsters is their stagger
[2:59:53] <linSP> dark souls is Doom levels of important as an influential game
[2:59:54] <dekkitout> Back in my day, fps games were called doomclones
[2:59:55] <%Treasure_Vault> Tired of all these pong-em-ups
[2:59:56] <%Puhff> Dark...Souls? Never heard of it
[2:59:58] <%SovPho> batman game that made assassins' creed into a blockbuster
[2:59:58] <+TopTieramisu> every platformer is a mario-like
[3:00:00] <+FoolsArcade> If Dark Souls wasn't a big deal it wouldn't have... 6 games.... that grew out from it.
[3:00:02] <%Meekest> It REALLY feels like there should be VA
[3:00:07] <%coward_man> Dark souls is just 3D castlevania (but not bad like thos bad 3D castlevanias)
[3:00:14] <+0dinpen> whats that thing, your dark...soul
[3:00:15] <%LouieRouie> Clever name
[3:00:17] <@SoFarFetched> I heard barking geefThink
[3:00:18] <@Lion_kun> I am so hyped for elden ring, I'm taking time off work for it.
[3:00:19] <MechanizedGentleman> MEIDO
[3:00:19] <%RealThiele> oozing with ooze
[3:00:20] <@SoFarFetched> HE BARK
[3:00:21] <%AzureGale> BORK
[3:00:23] <+MisterAvry> the thing about the dark souls influences is that they're REALLY good ideas to make games fun
[3:00:23] <%Ipsenscastle> The Arkham Asylum phase was okay, hell, Spider-man only perfected that combat system very recently
[3:00:26] <%baka_sugoi> boss 1
[3:00:27] <Mattais88> I'm playing Hollow Knight right now
[3:00:28] <@SoFarFetched> DOGGO BORKS PAT
[3:00:32] <MechanizedGentleman> I would smooch
[3:00:35] <%RealThiele> this will be great
[3:00:36] <%kingofasgard> his stance is all wrong
[3:00:37] <%Dakuu75> COOL
[3:00:37] <%coward_man> corrupted robot nun?
[3:00:37] <%justcallmebobplease> @TopTieramisu Every Mario game is a Jump-man-like.
[3:00:37] <%vandastelka> crasy priest fight
[3:00:38] <%joodatious> this is so anime
[3:00:40] <%Ziegsy> ooo crazy nun
[3:00:42] <@TheYellowcouch> idk why I thought she as on a motorcycle lol

[3:00:54] <linSP> the crazy nun!
[3:00:55] <%Dakuu75> omg she has those angel-wing bones
[3:00:56] <%DashXero> The lady he was supposed to what?

[3:01:02] <intylerwe_trust> Love the music choice
[3:01:07] <triangularblasphemy> At least the fight will smell nice
[3:01:07] <%Sigma_190_Beta> Lady he was supposed to travel with.
[3:01:10] <+MisterAvry> the art in this room is great
[3:01:12] <$KnivesEve> ohh a nun
[3:01:17] <triangularblasphemy> This music is placid, man. It works for some reason
[3:01:18] <TheEmperorsEyebrows> OST be proper sad
[3:01:20] <%Sigma_190_Beta> At least according to the notes.
[3:01:21] <+TheBitingIrish> Is it a censer?
[3:01:23] <%baka_sugoi> save her pat
[3:01:25] <%AzureGale> Is this game's soundtrack all melancholy tunes
[3:01:28] <%Esparsenior> The sound design in this game is nutty
[3:01:28] <%coward_man> oh man if each boss becomes an attach that would be DOPE
[3:01:29] <Tomschiii> the music is great but for some reason it doesnt fit. cant really say why
[3:01:32] <%Esparsenior> It’s so nice
[3:01:32] <@GeneralSCPatton> This game really does the sad moody fight music well
[3:01:35] <%Dakuu75> OH SHIT

[3:02:30] <%joodatious> the DARKNESS
[3:02:33] <%sirisvirus> is there no stamana meter in this game
[3:02:35] <%vandastelka> stand power upgrade
[3:02:37] <linSP> feel like a hero yet
[3:02:39] <%RealThiele> my olnly other complaint besides map is the unlock order of stands is wildly all over the place
[3:02:45] <%coward_man> can we get more boss fights with sad themes? It's so damn good
[3:02:53] <chimeraxmachina> That slow-mo blood splatter was cooooool
[3:03:14] <intylerwe_trust> “Feel like a hero yet” my favorite line in any game with its context
[3:03:15] <MechanizedGentleman> the Rain
[3:03:16] <olm46> Did the opposite of that
[3:03:20] <Tomschiii> @coward_man its a skill to make them "right"
[3:03:23] <+TurnArklight> just about every boss in this game hecking owns
[3:03:33] <+Grayhammatter> the Rain monkaS
[3:03:35] <%baka_sugoi> woolieDATTEBAYO
[3:03:39] <hakumaribo> actually she did a really good job, she held the line till the end
[3:03:40] <AhmCha> Yeah this is a game with some solid bosses
[3:03:44] <+Midashu> strand style rain
[3:03:44] <+MisterAvry> shit yeah
[3:03:44] <%baka_sugoi> P A I N
[3:03:45] <sirrice77> @sirisvirus No instead attacks either have a cool down or they like attack at a certain rate that is not as fast as you can push the button
[3:03:45] <DianaTheAscian> STAND GET?
[3:03:53] <%vandastelka> second stand acquired
[3:03:54] <%RealThiele> City of tears nods approvingly
[3:03:58] <MechanizedGentleman> no way, double jump should be a mid-game unlock
[3:04:09] <olm46> It would!
[3:04:09] <stantheman_97> is this like a BB unit thing?
[3:04:12] <%VictorVonLouche> Well look at her
[3:04:14] <%vandastelka> .......

[3:15:01] <notsoy> oh no is this a bloodborne where they take someone else's corruption into themselves?
[3:15:04] <+Grayhammatter> that's a little concerning
[3:15:05] <zanzibarian_hamster> It's the opposite of frosted tips

[3:15:36] <Charlie99993> Speaking about Mili, they also did a bunch of sick songs for a game called Library of Ruina
[3:15:38] <+vexion_smh> niceee horse fren

[3:15:40] <zhenthrim213> i cant
[3:15:41] <Enn19> LUL
[3:15:44] <%vandastelka> notice how you have two sets
[3:15:45] <%baka_sugoi> pojectile
[3:15:51] <haisho> it's a slug
[3:15:52] <triangularblasphemy> Wormy
[3:15:53] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[3:15:54] <zanzibarian_hamster> holy water fart gas
[3:15:54] <draca23> Holy water
[3:15:56] <draca23> Kinda
[3:16:00] <+Grayhammatter> it certainly is
[3:16:03] <%BoxNavy> oh
[3:16:04] <%VictorVonLouche> well its a worm child
[3:16:06] <%hax_metatron> Just wait till you get the axe tho. It rules
[3:16:09] <sightlesspoem> need a grounder pound
[3:16:09] <%AzureGale> That's more like someone hurling a pile of wet towels
[3:16:11] <%baka_sugoi> later
[3:16:18] <%Treasure_Vault> You'll worm up to it
[3:16:26] <+Grayhammatter> need a better ground pound i guess
[3:16:31] <zhenthrim213> the crew
[3:16:39] <PartyFavors> squad up
[3:16:51] <%BoxNavy> A R F
[3:16:54] <tanarath> bork
[3:16:56] <%RealThiele> the save button is weird to me cause it saves when you use a bench
[3:17:07] <zhenthrim213> can you knockback those?
[3:17:12] <%AzureGale> It's funny 'cause ground pound is what I did to your m-*shot*
[3:17:24] <macathelo> she's a necromancer?
[3:17:24] <%baka_sugoi> the hard route
[3:17:41] <zhenthrim213> @AzureGale Ame has thought you well
[3:17:46] <%zuzuxiv> god these sound effects are fantastic
[3:17:46] <%vandastelka> try the priest while jumping
[3:17:50] <+breakersnap> is this game just worse bloodstained
[3:17:56] <%BoxNavy> the witch's thick
[3:17:58] <%BinaryFireball> did pat already do forgotten city?
[3:18:01] <%The_Protagonist> damn that Witch Thicket
[3:18:05] <%CalderGaming> ooo that dissonance
[3:18:05] <%BinaryFireball> that game is.... a thing
[3:18:10] <olm46> The witch's thick cat
[3:18:11] <triangularblasphemy> @BinaryFireball Yes
[3:18:13] <Jaysky> He did
[3:18:15] <%Ipsenscastle> Witch's Thicket sounds like a euphemism for pubic hair
[3:18:19] <%hax_metatron> My fav track
[3:18:19] <%BinaryFireball> did he hate it?
[3:18:29] <triangularblasphemy> @BinaryFireball No
[3:18:32] <%RealThiele> bloodstained item drop % make enough of a slog that is put these 2 games at a tie
[3:18:32] <%AzureGale> He loved it actually
[3:18:33] <olaksi> I feel like I saw this exact game like 10 years ago?
[3:18:36] <%Deano8817> @breakersnap this game looks way better then bloodstained tbh
[3:18:37] <charrchord> Hemwick
[3:18:40] <%BinaryFireball> ah thats good
[3:18:51] <zhenthrim213> oh man im goona have to get this for the soundtrack alone
[3:18:56] <%Ipsenscastle> @olaksi it's a lot like Child of Light
[3:19:01] <%DashXero> Like marionettes.
[3:19:03] <%Shubreaker> @binaryfireball he stopped where the devs told him too
[3:19:04] <Jaysky> He said he'll never stream it again though and only do offline
[3:19:07] <thackattack00> most people do
[3:19:07] <zhenthrim213> i do too
[3:19:08] <%BoxNavy> its very ugly
[3:19:09] <%The_Protagonist> yeah Salt and Sanctuary looks awful
[3:19:09] <triangularblasphemy> Hmmm... disagree on that one but it is a matter of taste
[3:19:09] <%Ipsenscastle> aesthetically speaking
[3:19:12] <%RealThiele> LUL
[3:19:12] <zhenthrim213> and i beat it
[3:19:13] <+Grayhammatter> oof
[3:19:13] <+mattiabh> s&s has a terrible art style
[3:19:14] <+0dinpen> was it too tweeny for you?
[3:19:15] <%coward_man> yeah all the models have multiple layers that slider around for movement, and it looks nice
[3:19:18] <Manwad> paper doll animation is rad as fuck
[3:19:19] <DynzelWashington> Really reminds me of Child of Light.
[3:19:20] <%The_Protagonist> the second one looks worse somehow
[3:19:22] <%Treasure_Vault> It looks so bad. I enjoyed playing the game but actively forgot what every boss looked like.
[3:19:23] <charrchord> heavy tweening
[3:19:27] <%hax_metatron> You’re not alone Pat
[3:19:30] <%hax_metatron> It’s a good game tho
[3:19:33] <StarlitStunner> The faces in Salt and Sanctuary looked like poptropica
[3:19:38] <%Ne1son> I adore everything about this aesthetic, it really gels
[3:19:38] <%hax_metatron> You should try Vigil: The Longest Night
[3:19:48] <%Agami23> it reminds me of a mix of vanillaware games and momodora
[3:19:51] <linSP> it reminded me of old flash animation games
[3:19:51] <Louie_Salmon> The head of every human in salt and sanctuary looks like a moldy potato
[3:19:52] <mrtanaka111> whos this cute girl on the couch?
[3:19:52] <%RealThiele> in S&S defrense its kinda old these days
[3:19:56] <%Treasure_Vault> Salt and Sanctuary has some really cool ideas, hidden behind an ugly everything
[3:19:57] <@GeneralSCPatton> Alright, rebooted internet. Maybe the stream won't stutter anymore.
[3:20:03] <sightlesspoem> Worm Grenade
[3:20:06] <%hax_metatron> This game is also the perfect length. I want more AA gems like this < 20 hours
[3:20:11] <%The_Protagonist> like as an animator, watching gameplay of S&S made me cringe, and I feel bad saying it but it's just not well done
[3:20:12] <brunoberserk> my problem with is more salt&sanctuary is more with the systems/mechanics , is too much and the game dont do a great job explaining
[3:20:24] <%Treasure_Vault> S&S had weapon buff resins that refilled like estus, so you actually used them
[3:20:28] <@GeneralSCPatton> Ok, this tune is definitely more of a Castlevania vibe
[3:20:31] <$Wynzler> I was super underwhelmed when I first started playing this game
[3:20:35] <%baka_sugoi> a bit
[3:20:35] <%VictorVonLouche> by like 3 i think
[3:20:36] <zhenthrim213> how much is this
[3:20:41] <%RealThiele> its a small amount
[3:20:50] <$Wynzler> Then after I 100%ed it in a few days I couldn't help but wonder "where's the rest"
[3:20:50] <%baka_sugoi> @VictorVonLouche ye
[3:20:56] <%vandastelka> cant wait till you get to the ending and turns out its  based on how many stands you have like if you have too many you get a bad end.
[3:20:57] <+unfortunatpanda> critroleHellobees jocatBEES critroleHellobees jocatBEES critroleHellobees
[3:21:09] <$Wynzler> In the best way
[3:21:18] <%Dakuu75> ok, can swim and it's not death. that's nice
[3:21:18] <Enn19> @Wynzler Yeah it was a slow burn but give it time,it really opens up SeemsGood
[3:21:19] <%Ipsenscastle> These platforming environments are lessening my hype
[3:21:25] <%BinaryFireball> @hax_metatron the world needs more AA games
[3:21:37] <%RealThiele> the game does a shitton of platforming
[3:21:40] <%BinaryFireball> especially now with where the tech is at
[3:21:50] <$Wynzler> @Enn19 I was saying I loved it lol I *did* say I 100%ed it, ya silly
[3:21:53] <Enn19> Pretty water effect :O
[3:22:03] <%baka_sugoi> equipt
[3:22:09] <Enn19> @Wynzler Yeah I saw that too late sorry LUL
[3:22:15] <%The_Protagonist> if you guys like Metroidvanias like this I highly recommend checking out the games by Team Ladybug. They have a Shin Megami Tensei one, a Touhou one, and a Record Of Lodoss War one and they're all phenomenal
[3:22:16] <%baka_sugoi> blep
[3:22:23] <triangularblasphemy> Yeah, I think I am going to steal this ost for a tabletop campaign I'm running
[3:22:24] <$Wynzler> This game's music is so quaint, I love it
[3:22:26] <DianaTheAscian> upgrades people upgrades
[3:22:33] <triangularblasphemy> This is hitting just right
[3:22:33] <Buttku> Is the game any good? Compared to hollow or ori?
[3:22:39] <Louie_Salmon> Yes those ladybug games kick ass
[3:22:43] <%BoxNavy> nice looking wodder too
[3:22:43] <%RealThiele> shove the goo into your stando for power
[3:22:44] <Minorou> Team Ladybug stuff is freak
[3:22:50] <Minorou> great*
[3:22:50] <%Dakuu75> @The_Protagonist doodShake
[3:22:51] <%AzureGale> Can confirm, Touhou Luna Nights fucking owns
[3:22:54] <$Wynzler> @The_Protagonist have you heard of an underrated gem by the name of HOLLOW KNIGHT lol I kid, I kid
[3:22:56] <Minorou> heck of a mispelling
[3:23:02] <+Nnapss> Nnapss subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! psaGib
[3:23:05] <%RealThiele> @Buttku worse that hollow knight id put if half a notch above Ori 2
[3:23:14] <%AzureGale> You get to play as knife maid time girl Sakuya
[3:23:21] <ExpressNode> Gensokyo Night Festival is a good one too
[3:23:22] <%The_Protagonist> also the Shin Megami Tensei one is free so
[3:23:27] <%hax_metatron> Some of the stands you get in this game are awesome. Really creative even if some are unfortunately kind of far into the game
[3:23:29] <DianaTheAscian> I like it
[3:23:32] <%The_Protagonist> you just gotta grab an english patch for it
[3:23:34] <%NopeBadguy> I think it's largely the piano
[3:23:34] <ExpressNode> Though its not completely finished
[3:23:35] <linSP> these guys made Luna nights? no wonder
[3:23:39] <%baka_sugoi> This got me through a roadtrip
[3:23:39] <%NopeBadguy> This piano piece is beautiful
[3:23:49] <triangularblasphemy> The music is very chill, but it also feels properly off
[3:23:49] <+Sendrak70> Meh
[3:23:58] <brunoberserk> lodoss war metroidvania is really good but is so short and is kinda easy
[3:24:03] <Buttku> @realthiele so, pretty good
[3:24:05] <%RigmaroleHM> I keep thinking the tune is going to do the Pirates of the Caribbean Theme
[3:24:12] <%DashXero> Gotta get up to get down...
[3:24:16] <@GeneralSCPatton> Gotta clear them delicious side paths
[3:24:20] <%AzureGale> Gacha
[3:24:23] <@GeneralSCPatton> POT MIMIC
[3:24:26] <%RealThiele> yea its not a bad game, if im a number guy id give this a 8/10
[3:24:29] <Enn19> POT MIMIC
[3:24:30] <+Axle13j> yooo
[3:24:33] <%RealThiele> MIMIC-CHAN
[3:24:34] <+Grayhammatter> WHOA
[3:24:40] <@GeneralSCPatton> BENCH MIMIC WHEN?
[3:24:40] <%baka_sugoi> nom
[3:24:40] <triangularblasphemy> I think pot mimic is living the best life here
[3:24:41] <%hax_metatron> LUL
[3:24:43] <charrchord> They beat elden ring to the punch
[3:24:45] <+Grayhammatter> a mimic! great!
[3:24:46] <%hax_metatron> Mimic CHWAAAN
[3:24:50] <%AzureGale> I bet Pot Mimic oculd get me real high
[3:24:52] <Louie_Salmon> Was I seeing things, or does this character have a 3D mario mid-air dive move for platforming?
[3:24:55] <triangularblasphemy> Without health insurance, I think pot mimic is what I will become in twenty years
[3:25:04] <%RealThiele> @Louie_Salmon yes
[3:25:06] <Enn19> What's next? A LADDER mimic?
[3:25:14] <%hax_metatron> This boss is a test for sure
[3:25:15] <%baka_sugoi> SLO MO
[3:25:22] <%RealThiele> FART GAS GET
[3:25:23] <%thebeargoesHONK> goth lolita souls?
[3:25:24] <%hax_metatron> Oh wait I’m thinking of another one nvm
[3:25:24] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[3:25:29] <+Devilbringer814> poison mist is great
[3:25:33] <%AzureGale> I bet her hair only changes for major bosses
[3:25:33] <triangularblasphemy> For all you mimic lovers, Enter the Gungeon has a pretty insane roster
[3:25:40] <%VictorVonLouche> Doesn't change on mini bosses
[3:25:40] <notsoy> i think the ends of her hair darkened
[3:25:41] <%RealThiele> poison mist is no joke the best stand
[3:25:42] <%vandastelka> yeah it does get darker
[3:25:44] <enreimirai> Oh hey, I love this game
[3:25:45] <Louie_Salmon> No game will ever go farther with mimics than Death's Gambit
[3:25:46] <%Shubreaker> there's a black streak
[3:25:48] <linSP> fart gas
[3:25:48] <enreimirai> gl pat!
[3:26:05] <triangularblasphemy> @Louie_Salmon What kind does it have?
[3:26:10] <%AzureGale> The streak was there after the first boss :x
[3:26:10] <@GeneralSCPatton> I never noticed that
[3:26:21] <%Caped_Eggy> She's sucking up the black juice
[3:26:27] <zhenthrim213> @triangularblasphemy bonfir mimics
[3:26:28] <%RealThiele> @GeneralSCPatton it gets wild later
[3:26:34] <%The_Protagonist> but yeah if you guys love the Jack Bros, definitely go play Shin Megami Tensei Synchro. You swap between Frost and Pyro. Free To Play, just needs an english patch. Definitely one of my favorites. thepro95Jack thepro95Jack thepro95Jack
[3:26:37] <linSP> corrupt the anime!
[3:26:39] <ExpressNode> I completely forgot about that movie
[3:26:40] <notsoy> yeah, the streak was after first boss, the ends turned black after the second
[3:26:41] <%hax_metatron> She made friends with F.F.
[3:26:45] <Louie_Salmon> @triangularblasphemy Bloodstain mimic
[3:26:48] <triangularblasphemy> @zhenthrim213 ahhhh I see
[3:26:50] <%coward_man> who I never noticed that before
[3:26:53] <%AzureGale> This reminds me of Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time where the Prince loses more of his clothes as the game progresses
[3:26:56] <%Treuan> The only scene I remember is that one messed up scene with PH
[3:27:07] <TheresAGoff> Whats the consensus on The first Silent Hill film? Good or Shit?
[3:27:23] <+Grayhammatter> oh right, that scene
[3:27:29] <%coward_man> I'd say generally good but flawed
[3:27:32] <@GeneralSCPatton> @AzureGale Was I crazy or did that slightly buff his platforming abilities each time?
[3:27:34] <thackattack00> jump down the put
[3:27:35] <lethallylactic> @TheresAGoff Shit with maybe 1 or 2 good scenes
[3:27:36] <thackattack00> pit
[3:27:42] <Nautilaa> did he finish ME3?
[3:27:54] <%RealThiele> ME3 still being worked on
[3:28:02] <+Grayhammatter> wtf?
[3:28:10] <%rumtumtugnutz> That was up Pat
[3:28:19] <%hax_metatron> I want more waterfalls you can swim up in video games
[3:28:21] <%AzureGale> @GeneralSCPatton p sure only his health and sand capacity upgraded in that game
[3:28:25] <%RealThiele> Waterfall? no. Waterfloat
[3:28:51] <%RealThiele> paige burger worm
[3:28:51] <%AzureGale> YOU DIED
[3:28:56] <%AzureGale> ight back into it tho
[3:28:57] <+Grayhammatter> F
[3:28:58] <%NopeBadguy> very metroid fusion/zero mission death animation
[3:29:03] <%VictorVonLouche> missed the shortcut though
[3:29:05] <%bravebravesrobin> I'm so pissed they messed up the second SH movie; I actually really liked the first one Cheer500
[3:29:09] <@GeneralSCPatton> I knew that wall shot would get him. They're tough until you learn the pattern.
[3:29:09] <%coward_man> damn that's a real fast respawn, music didn't even cut
[3:29:11] <+Grayhammatter> oh wow, and we back at it again
[3:29:34] <%RealThiele> some of those shortcuts can be hit with cheddar
[3:30:02] <%Raiden_Breaker> this reminds me of the momodora games witch you have likely heard people say multiple times
[3:30:07] <linSP> the music is growing on me, it isn’t phoned in like in a lot of anime games
[3:30:08] <%VictorVonLouche> missed it again
[3:30:12] <+TheBitingIrish> wot
[3:30:18] <Enn19> @PatStaresAt Look at it on the ground,it moves further into the foreground
[3:30:25] <%RealThiele> Halfcoordinateds momodora run was a blast to watch
[3:30:26] <ChungusQuest> aww, they got little black mage hats
[3:30:48] <thackattack00> the degree to which projectiles track in this game is kinda BS
[3:30:58] <@GeneralSCPatton> Just Monica
[3:31:04] <Enn19> @PatStaresAt The water,sorry
[3:31:05] <Louie_Salmon> I'm loving the heavy emphasis on projectile enemies, bodes well for later bosses
[3:31:05] <%VictorVonLouche> care on iframes multiple projectiles stack damage
[3:31:06] <+Grayhammatter> manisa
[3:31:08] <%baka_sugoi> stairs
[3:31:16] <%AzureGale> Fucking Monikammmmmmmmmmmm
[3:31:22] <%Retinolgaming> ded
[3:31:28] <triangularblasphemy> That is a shiny way to go
[3:31:29] <hakumaribo> try poison mist
[3:31:30] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> Pat can't stop destroying children
[3:31:34] <%baka_sugoi> ope
[3:31:35] <hakumaribo> is actually kinda op
[3:31:39] <ExpressNode> That bench thing is totally a Hollow Knight
[3:31:43] <%hax_metatron> Jojo poses galore!
[3:31:55] <+fetrigon> wow that's a nice death animation
[3:31:57] <%AzureGale> why run past all the xp
[3:32:17] <%RealThiele> poison mist IS the best stand no joke imo
[3:32:33] <Louie_Salmon> @azuregale Gotta stream fast
[3:33:09] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> this game seems very pretty
[3:33:15] <+Grayhammatter> whoa
[3:33:22] <%VictorVonLouche> More attacks
[3:33:22] <%RealThiele> this game is VERY pretty
[3:33:36] <%vandastelka> 3 more
[3:33:42] <+pectusumbra> More Stando powa
[3:33:51] <enreimirai> Can I just say how much I appreciate no fall damage?
[3:33:58] <enreimirai> This game would be miserable with fall damage
[3:34:18] <Louie_Salmon> In a platformer, no fall damage is a neccesity
[3:34:18] <%vandastelka> this game is big as hell
[3:34:18] <%RealThiele> you can equip a stand on multiple loadouts like the sword
[3:34:21] <%AzureGale> Noice
[3:34:33] <artoflec> harpSIchord elaSmile
[3:34:34] <+Grayhammatter> noice
[3:34:38] <$Faustgesicht> How long have we been on Ender Lilies?
[3:34:50] <%RealThiele> maybe 1hr?
[3:34:54] <Enn19> @PatStaresAt You can put the same soul in BOTH sets if you want
[3:34:55] <%VictorVonLouche> about an hour
[3:34:57] <%AzureGale> About an hour
[3:35:08] <%AzureGale> Miss me, miss me, now you gotta kiss me
[3:35:09] <+Devilbringer814> here we gooo
[3:35:10] <enreimirai> you are still within beta territory in terms of completion, so basically the start-ish
[3:35:28] <%vandastelka> remember to press rb to switch to your second set of stands
[3:35:34] <+Devilbringer814> oh yeah we cant see boss names
[3:35:56] <%Faustgesicht> Faustgesicht subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 31 months! Resub. what what
[3:36:07] <%BoxNavy> socceress
[3:36:08] <%AzureGale> WIND BLADE
[3:36:13] <@GeneralSCPatton> Aww, you reunited that couple in death
[3:36:16] <%RealThiele> never cared for this one
[3:36:32] <+Devilbringer814> this one is pretty good when upgraded
[3:36:39] <%BoxNavy> hmmm
[3:36:40] <+D00msDayDan> does it lack soul
[3:36:44] <%Meekest> Maybe you hate women
[3:36:45] <%Ipsenscastle> the level design is real blocky, it feels like Subspace Emissary to me
[3:36:46] <%AzureGale> Souls fatigue, perhaps?
[3:36:46] <$Wynzler> Probably because the combat isn't very complex
[3:36:46] <+FoolsArcade> It seems a bit shallow? Just from watching
[3:36:47] <%RealThiele> fair
[3:36:47] <olaksi> art is good but concept seems a bit tired
[3:36:48] <Teyaric> It's because the enemy placement / design doesn't live up to the combat standard.
[3:36:49] <+puffinup> it's the anime girl
[3:36:49] <Louie_Salmon> You should give Death's Gambit a shot at some point
[3:36:50] <+fetrigon> hits aren't meaty enough?
[3:36:53] <+pectusumbra> item
[3:36:53] <%VictorVonLouche> item
[3:36:54] <+PR0swagonist> hits dont have a satisficing effect to them
[3:36:54] <ExpressNode> I guess it seems pretty aimless?
[3:36:58] <%RealThiele> combat is just smack smack smack
[3:36:59] <%AzureGale> DED
[3:37:00] <%ElkRiverDog> Progression seems too linear?
[3:37:03] <%NopeBadguy> W A S T E D
[3:37:03] <%Agami23> could be the sound design. attacks seem to lack and umf
[3:37:05] <%livlinn> Looks repetitive
[3:37:05] <$Wynzler> @AzureGale is there such a thing?
[3:37:06] <%SaphronBlackbourne> I'm digging this way more than Hollow Knight
[3:37:08] <%VictorVonLouche> meaty how?
[3:37:10] <+ReallyBigRocks> I guess there's only so much you can do with a side scroller souls em up
[3:37:11] <+FoolsArcade> more meat is always good
[3:37:12] <thackattack00> the combat lacks impact yeah, it's my only complaint
[3:37:19] <%crimsonharvest> i have a hard time with these lavish sprites its kind of floaty and indistinct what they're doing
[3:37:21] <%VictorVonLouche> Oh you get meaty attacks later
[3:37:21] <%Meekest> gg Pat
[3:37:23] <%AzureGale> Good look anyhow
[3:37:25] <%vandastelka> well rip
[3:37:27] <%RealThiele> we need Vordt
[3:37:28] <@TheYellowcouch> It's very pretty
[3:37:32] <@GeneralSCPatton> There is a heavier main weapon you get kind of early
[3:37:36] <@TheYellowcouch> but there's not much to it yet
[3:37:38] <%justcallmebobplease> If the feel isn't it, that's that.
[3:37:38] <@GeneralSCPatton> But it do feel light
[3:37:39] <+vexion_smh> it's okay
[3:37:39] <Sabbrewolf> There are meatier spirits. But if you aren't feeling it you aren't feeling it
[3:37:40] <%Agami23> this makes me want to play aria of sorrow instead
[3:37:41] <%Ipsenscastle> that first boss was rad, but then there was nothing else
[3:37:42] <%baka_sugoi> it okay
[3:37:43] <%SveriSageAdvice> oh, i know what it is, Hitstop
[3:37:43] <%AzureGale> Thanks for giving it a shot
[3:37:43] <%vandastelka> oh well its not for everyone
[3:37:44] <linSP> I do like the style more than holler knight
[3:37:44] <%livlinn> Yeah there’s something with soundtrack too
[3:37:47] <%SveriSageAdvice> lack of hitstop
[3:37:48] <enreimirai> sadge
[3:37:48] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt Any chance of playing the FF Pixel Remasters on stream?
[3:37:48] <%BoxNavy> thank peepo
[3:37:49] <%Faustgesicht> Yeah, this feels super floaty.
[3:37:50] <@TheYellowcouch> Week done
[3:37:54] <@Lion_kun> Is Enders not worth playing?
[3:37:55] <%RealThiele> the stands are too far apart
[3:37:59] <Mr_pwng3> fuck
[3:38:00] <+pectusumbra> It's a good looking game for sure. Probably a personal taste more than anything
[3:38:01] <%Dakuu75> "now"
[3:38:07] <Mr_pwng3> get here just as it ends
[3:38:09] <%Puhff> oops, boring game

[3:38:24] <%coward_man> the first is pretty good until the plot dump in the hospital
