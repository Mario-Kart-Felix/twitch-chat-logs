[0:13:41] <$ImasukyLomae> 1
[0:13:41] <Cranky_Construct> Toriyama's style is incredibly samey
[0:13:42] <madogod> why is paige always eating on stream?
[0:13:42] <element_of_loyalty> AH HAH
[0:13:43] <+Elexius> That's fair, everyone looks like Goku, Trunks, Bulma, or Android 17.
[0:13:43] <%goose_attack_almanac> 2
[0:13:44] <%applesonthemoon> 2
[0:13:44] <Prevot> Pat doesn't know what an artstyle is
[0:13:44] <crimsonharvest> Pat's doing everyone a service
[0:13:44] <%PipIV> 2
[0:13:44] <MasterDecoder> XD
[0:13:45] <ProRJHunter> 2
[0:13:45] <+redanimator> one piece is better
[0:13:45] <MeAuntieNora> I think I kind of agree
[0:13:46] <mrjohncarlton> His robots look great. All his monsters are just Cell/Frieza parts mushed together though
[0:13:46] <+Fynale> paige is wrong
[0:13:46] <+Fenlig> Whats your style Pat?
[0:13:46] <DonatelloJose> 2
[0:13:46] <+Bupkis7> He can draw one male face and two female faces
[0:13:47] <madogod> 2
[0:13:48] <treborant> Kappa
[0:13:49] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> 2
[0:13:49] <%goose_attack_almanac> But he's right
[0:13:49] <+griffball13> THAT IS A FAIR OPINION
[0:13:50] <redwilt> his artstyle has a certain consistency
[0:13:50] <ShadowZiggy> Old Dragonball style is the best imo
[0:13:51] <%patriotrenegade> Except he's right
[0:13:51] <+bigbradish> Crazy Talk is a thing for a reason
[0:13:51] <@SSaryn> 2

[0:13:55] <DonatelloJose> I ALREADY DID PAT
[0:13:55] <outis94> but i love magus im vegeta
[0:13:56] <NopeBadguy> He has a very distinct artstyle with his characters, but the actual aesthetic of it all varies from work to work. It's very easy to be desensitized to it due to Dragon Ball oversaturation. @AngriestPat
[0:13:57] <CatmanIX> @Djinnazz better, due to re-usability, but only if you stick with that straw some few hundred uses or so
[0:13:57] <scottysunday> Blue Dragon gave us a chicken dew so I'm happy.
[0:13:57] <%GarbageNirvana> He sure knows how to design the same characters over and over
[0:13:57] <%ThatGuyfromMars> 2

[0:14:09] <%PipIV> ?
[0:14:12] <%cyberbunny48> His "style" is 4 different faces and 4 different haircuts. And if you're really lucky, the faces between the men and women won't look the same
[0:14:12] <@SSaryn> Wow
[0:14:15] <MarylandJutsu> CLEMPS SAYS THIS IS A GOOD GAME TOO
[0:14:15] <Parapattern> Toryiama drawings is the same

[0:18:30] <TheBlankAce> Dragon Quest 8 did have the orchestrated tracks in the west but there was a big kerfuffle and western Square got chewed out
[0:18:31] <%deviljhojho94> we should probably just pirate this LUL

[1:43:20] <dero45> That’s some wet water boi
[1:43:21] <shnorkk> One touch I really loved is that if you break pots or open dressers next to npc's in their house, they yell at you
[1:43:22] <dekkitout> link is a maniac
[1:43:24] <+chrishnaw> BotW has better water

[1:43:39] <crimsonharvest> Pat this is a pro tip: get the Greatsword's AOE move asap.
[1:43:39] <%jonesyboy_19> Link just breaks into your house and steals your coins

[1:43:44] <DeanX27> Link also gets pulled into every woman's house so they can "restore his health".
[1:43:45] <+FeVaRi024> The correct term is RuPess
[1:43:45] <Zinectrik> Cause this is amazing
[1:43:46] <SulfurousAcid> Pat you are wasting your MP
[1:43:47] <Semiconductive> OMG she cheers!?

[1:43:51] <%DedlokPM> He runs in and bust expensive vases for the $1 inside of them.
[1:43:54] <Maleicus> sandy goodest girl
[1:43:56] <CrypticMochi> He’s redecorating
[1:43:58] <dero45> Link thinks he’s the chosen but he’s just crazy
[1:43:58] <Warbot40> This version of the soundtrack is so much better.
[1:44:00] <TheBlankAce> The Dragon quest protagonists are worse, they rummage through cabinets to steal clothes as well.
[1:44:00] <shnorkk> @x24sonic You haven't played many rpg's, have you?
[1:44:00] <+JenovasPuppet> She's doing her best!

The main story involves defeating and forcing the hero and demon lord of each planet to expand your power. They do not shy away from the kind of sketchy behaviour heroes get up to.

[2:28:42] <awsomesaucekirby> cheer232 hey pat, we were covering marxist economics in class today, apparently something something items of value by use only have value when in use. Therefore, saving up items makes them objectively useless. You're whole ideology on rpg items has been brought down around your head

[2:28:43] <%AncelDeLambert> I guess there's not enough girls around going uguu for this to be Liam

[2:31:24] <%deviljhojho94> BUY EVERY WHORE ON THIS GODFORSAKEN VILLAGE
[2:31:27] <+Mekhet09> @AngriestPat You should play puppeter it's a good game. I'd suggest it to paige but I realized it had mashing. But seriously it is an underrated classic.
[2:31:28] <+Arbal3st> who cares money aint shit in this game
[2:31:33] <+Grayhammatter> only the ones with the pink sparkles on them have outfit changing properties
[2:31:37] <%SuperCasualBoom> Unlike Paige, Pat won’t let Yang dead while shopping.
[2:31:37] <element_of_loyalty> waste cash on space hats
[2:31:40] <+LucentWulf> its not just dlc items that change your look, its any armor with purple sparkles @AngriestPat
[2:31:40] <$NocturneNovember> Tell your mom to give you the Puff-Puff!
[2:31:41] <+JenovasPuppet> Man, that sucks about the outfits not changing.
[2:31:43] <ekkieekk> some change the look, some don't
[2:31:43] <crimsonharvest> But for real go huge on the MC it's super fun to greatsword the fuck out of things
[2:31:43] <+Kravus> Remember to tell the other boys in the village that you're dumping Gemma
[2:31:45] <count_bob> !uptime
[2:31:46] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 31m 47s.
[2:31:48] <Lunatyr_> money doesn't matter so much this early anyway
[2:31:48] <+frigglefroogle> stores are a sham until later on in the game
[2:31:49] <%THATGUY_789> ya gone and fuked up

[2:32:13] <Crimpson> Yeah
[2:32:13] <echodrone81> you can upgrade the DLC outfit to literally the best end game armor
[2:32:14] <shockmaster3> yes
[2:32:14] <%OdysseyKnight> Yes
[2:32:18] <+GuelermeDias> yes
[2:32:18] <$NocturneNovember> @element_of_loyalty Hell yeah, she is!
[2:32:18] <+Arbal3st> you can only hold 3 pages of items on you
[2:32:21] <+Grayhammatter> yes
[2:32:21] <crimsonharvest> You can only use items you are holding in combat, the rest in the pack are for out of combat
[2:32:23] <SulfurousAcid> You can only carry so much the rest goes in your bag
[2:32:23] <+Kravus> A character can only hold so much
[2:32:25] <+resstarr> Party Members have a limit but your bag is bottomless
[2:32:26] <Crimpson> You can transfer the items to other characters later
[2:32:27] <Donchalant402> yes in order to use items you have to have them on your person
[2:32:28] <count_bob> Each party member has a different Inventory as well.
[2:32:29] <themightyseptopus> items on party members can be used in battle
[2:32:30] <thisisacoolguy> 4 pages
[2:32:30] <SulfurousAcid> the stuff on you is what you can use during battle
[2:32:33] <Crimpson> Or to your inventory bag
[2:32:34] <+dylin456> but pat its uneven stock on the items its only allowed to be uneven if its a 5
[2:32:35] <TheyCallMeVawn> Its for combat stuff

[2:33:36] <rasamune> The movement in this game looks weird
[2:33:36] <+Arbal3st> It should be addressed that DQ's inventory system is clunky and garbage.

[2:41:58] <%DedlokPM> @AngriestPat There was a Cypress Stick weapon in Nier Automata. Which was a crossover weapon from Dragon Quest. So that might be why it seemed kinda familiar.
[2:42:00] <%WorthlessSamurai> WutFace
[2:42:00] <crimsonharvest> If you notice, the battle is framed in the same place you start it, just after a cut

[2:52:13] <Donchalant402> @AngriestPat The draconian quest options exist because everyone thought this game was too easy. As you've noticed even this early on when you're at your weakest its kind of really hard to die. Harder monsters option is a godsend for anyone that doesnt want the game to be way too easy.
[2:52:13] <%ViewtifulYoshi> Persona 5 is so good.

[3:07:34] <%wkostecki> cheer201 Hey Patio! I'm taking a game development class at uni and was wondering how you guys would feel about a shitty fan mad sbfp fight game? Additionally, outside of your stand crazy talk, what kind of moves do you think you guys would want if you were fighting characters? All the best!
[3:07:37] <Austin0097> @sleepy_coffee A better question is why is there a couch under the ketchup?
