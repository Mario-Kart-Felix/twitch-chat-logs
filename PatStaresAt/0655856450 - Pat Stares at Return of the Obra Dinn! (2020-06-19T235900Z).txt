[0:04:56] <%AncelDeLambert> Sony Ponies can cry into their PS4 disc drives
[0:05:00] <%Dementedpenguin> @AxelCezar People on twitter called us an echo chamber LUL
[0:05:00] <%Promessa_EX> The only thing elmo passes is gas
[0:05:02] <CyricZ42> Just as a note, if you folks are thinking of playing this, might want to cut out after about half an hour of play.
[0:05:04] <%derap41> Honestly chat should be slow mode by default makes it way less spammy
[0:05:05] <+Solutha> Glory to Arstotzka
[0:05:06] <%Bailey__gaming> I don't know anything about this game I'm interested
[0:05:07] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> @AxelCezar ...how is anyone surprised by that though?
[0:05:09] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> psaBig psaBig psaBig
[0:05:14] <%Clundy> Just gotta hope mods are quick to catch spoilers cause hoo boy whenever anyone streams this that all I see in chat LUL
[0:05:17] <AntChodeny> i heard Zack passed away. big sads :(
[0:05:19] <nodge56> was watching some other last of us streams, and yeah it doesnt really get any better

[0:05:25] <%thelonechris> FeelsBadMan
[0:05:26] <indig0bird> oh, this game is so good
[0:05:27] <+konekoryugamine> Echo chamber? Damn can they come up with anything original?
[0:05:28] <@SoFarFetched> Im sure there will be a lot of backseating in this.
[0:05:30] <+stealthyProboscis> Not sure how well this game works as a stream game but it is a really good game

[0:05:35] <Robot_Nixon_> @garbocardboardington woudlnt 100% be just completing the game?
[0:05:39] <%Starotter70> @Clundy I just hope they have an easier time than yesterday
[0:05:39] <%Joustar_> Thanks for the PrideFloat @tizz86
[0:05:40] <+Maldoree> Confused elmo with Zach.....F
[0:05:42] <%AncelDeLambert> @CyricZ42 they can stick around pretty long, the actual puzzle portion of the game mostly takes place after the story portion. Which, while interesting, is quite short
[0:05:44] <%bugz_munny> Time for VIOLINS
[0:05:53] <%Promessa_EX> sweet baby m64Cry
[0:05:53] <%bugz_munny> and FRENCH HORNS
[0:05:55] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @Clundy Isn't this the game where you can just pin the blame all on one dude with no real evidence and walk away with an ending?
[0:05:56] <%Bt_Robot> Bt_Robot subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 16 months! Greeting s Pat and good luck fighting the Old Gods. If the old ones from H.P. Lovecraft's series were real, which one would you worship? Or would you rail futilely against the dark?
[0:05:56] <indig0bird> There sure fucking will! Sorry in advance @sofarfetched
[0:05:57] <%tizz86> @j0ustar np
[0:06:02] <%ThePuddingDead> Thankfully he's checking this out, I've thought about picking this up
[0:06:09] <+konekoryugamine> Same
[0:06:11] <CyricZ42> @AncelDeLambert Good point. It'll probably take him a bit to get through all that
[0:06:12] <%Bailey__gaming> what is the game about
[0:06:12] <+icerpendune> hey chat how is all
[0:06:16] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> this is also definitely one of those games that, if you watch the stream and like it, stop watching spoilers and go play it
[0:06:16] <%bugz_munny> yeah this has an achievement for blaming everything on the butler
[0:06:17] <$HyperionXV> distComfy
[0:06:20] <@SoFarFetched> You figure out what happened on the obra dinn
[0:06:27] <%bugz_munny> Thinks its called "Butler did it"
[0:06:28] <alephalpha> AYYYYY OBRA DINN
[0:06:33] <%garbocardboardington> IF YOU HAVEN‚ÄôT PLAYED ALREADY: I highly recommend picking this up on steam, it‚Äôs pretty cheap, and watching someone else play can ruin the experience.
[0:06:35] <%PeruggiaUK> I‚Äôve heard so many good things about this but no clue how it plays.
[0:06:35] <$JayKitsuneStreaming> JayKitsuneStreaming subscribed at Tier 1.

[0:06:50] <+konekoryugamine> I keep forgetting today is Friday
[0:06:52] <+NutolasCage> Reminds me that Outer Wilds just came out on Steam too
[0:06:55] <%Frost_Quill> I have no idea what this game is about.
[0:06:56] <%ThePuddingDead> I just want to see how gameplay is
[0:06:57] <+dmtjinni> Fps?
[0:07:01] <%goatbait> Today feels like a Thursday
[0:07:05] <%bugz_munny> This game is going to be a lot like outer wilds guys, careful with puzzle solutions if you think of em before pat
[0:07:08] <%BallerSwagBro9k> This can't be s good game, it doesn't have AAA graphics Kappa Kappa Kappa
[0:07:08] <%AncelDeLambert> @Frost_Quill then strap in, this is gonna be fun
[0:07:09] <%ThePuddingDead> if gameplay is solid, i'll definitely pick it up

I'd rather see you stream DMC 2 with a broken Madkatz controller than see you continue that journey. I think I would get more emotional resonance from a 3 hour super-cut of Elmo's litterbox habits.

[0:28:03] <%PanicSwytch> Roses are legs?
[0:28:04] <%heartlesshealer> it's the director's fault
[0:28:06] <%dinnydanny777> Ellie's voice actor can sing
[0:28:06] <%Th3SmartAlec> It's the voice director's fault
[0:28:08] <%derap41> Its 100% directing
[0:28:09] <megatronsdong96> tbf Pat can't read either
[0:28:09] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> it's both
[0:28:12] <+OwlLightningMage> The voice directing is terrible
[0:28:14] <benjiFG> "make sure yuo sound exactly the same"
[0:28:14] <%Monkeyweed21> low monotone voice is SERIOUS DRAMA
[0:28:15] <$RealThiele> Ashley Johnson has pipes

[0:28:19] <Solidnick18> some va's called people bots or something
[0:28:20] <SGrim> @BinaryFireball does having your soul die before your body make you a god or a devil?
[0:28:20] <%BoneofMalkav> Wouldn't be surprised if Neil Druckman directed them.
[0:28:23] <%RedKnightVI> She was good in Westworld
[0:28:26] <%MalekDracarus> channel points go brrrr
[0:28:27] <%twoto858> I can excuse Ellie's voice, but Dina was just kinda boring
[0:28:27] <televisedrevolting> Good directions, eh?
[0:28:27] <lloyddboy> EXPOSED
[0:28:27] <+Remery_> "Sound tired and bored"
[0:28:28] <%spiritofmojave> Troy Baker also sounds not amazing here, it's clearly direction
[0:28:32] <%Starotter70> Or fuck her
[0:28:35] <%heartlesshealer> It's like Padme in SW prequels directing
[0:28:36] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> Metal Gear?
[0:28:36] <%Dementedpenguin> Pat playing TLoU2 reminded me when he played through Code Veronica. Looked like he was being tortured.

[0:28:42] <%walternatorz> I wish I was a sexy exposition device.
[0:28:43] <%garbocardboardington> It‚Äôs true
[0:28:44] <SGrim> Dina's personality is peppy but depressed.
[0:28:49] <+blurblewurble> @optimasmaximas almost definitely, because art is Suffering
[0:28:49] <bluebiscuit94> Direction can make or break a performance, regardless of the skill of the voice actor
[0:28:49] <%dinnydanny777> Ellie and Joel had good chemistry in the first game, Dina and Ellie have no chemistry
[0:28:51] <%lockhead45> sbfpPatschwitz
[0:28:51] <+OwlLightningMage> She only exists to fuck Ellie. This game doesn't have characters like the first one did
[0:28:54] <+konekoryugamine> YEAH
[0:28:57] <%derap41> You have know Idea most of her dialog is asking Ellie how they should Progress so Eliie can tell the player what to do
[0:28:58] <+konekoryugamine> DEAD BY DAYLIGHT!
[0:29:00] <+konekoryugamine> WHOO!
[0:29:00] <%Captainahab_37> is Pat done completely with TLOU2
[0:29:01] <KLouDraws> its like a combo of weird writing and odd direction for the voices, in my opinion of course
[0:29:01] <televisedrevolting> @sgrim That's an oxymoron?
[0:29:01] <AxelCezar> dina could be just a faceless tposing model and nothing would change
[0:29:14] <%garbocardboardington> Dina only exists so that Ellie can be gay with someone
[0:29:15] <patpoops> Dead by Daylight is not a good game. Please, change my mind.
[0:29:16] <%Mendin> Killers queue is also kinda fucked right now because a new killer just came out
[0:29:21] <%heartlesshealer> All PvP games have matchup times dependent on time of day because timezones
[0:29:22] <%lockhead45> sbfpUno sbfpUno sbfpUno
[0:29:24] <SGrim> @televisedrevolting exactly. She swings wildly between the two, and never settles on either. It's awful.
[0:29:25] <PlasticJake> the only good parts in TLOU2 are the Ellie/Joel flashbacks. that game is hot garbage otherwise
[0:29:28] <%optimasmaximas> @blurblewurble damn, and during pride month smh, fuck neil drukkman
[0:29:30] <%BusterRepukken> @Captainahab_37 Potentially, hasnt fully decided yet.

[0:50:14] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @Fien111 As someone who lived in New England which is better England, I can tell you that it comes from worse England.
[0:50:16] <%r0chelimit> I've been meaning to pick it up
[0:50:17] <+OwlLightningMage> When do you murder a dog?
[0:50:19] <@commanderclaw> This game's aesthetic is fucking baller

[0:50:27] <yeetdabsenpai69> @bread_assassin I mean if you know the game enough but hearing mr so and so died like this means nothing to a rando
[0:50:27] <@StridentSong> @patstaresat There's other color filters in the options, similar to World of Horror
[0:50:30] <reonome> fuck i love this game
[0:50:30] <%de1ete_forever> how informationative
[0:50:33] <%garbocardboardington> *EVERY PART OF THIS BOOK IS IMPORTANT*
[0:50:33] <%dukenux> this reminds me of The Terror series
[0:50:34] <@SoFarFetched> @SomeOtherNeb variety,he asked in discord if people wanted Obra Din or Warhammer 2,most people said Obra Dinn
[0:50:37] <+konekoryugamine> Right down to the Peak of God Hope

[0:50:57] <%Fien111> @King_Wolf_Rigger yes but I need to know what part specifically to avoid
[0:50:58] <a_mad_dragon> orlop?
[0:50:59] <Robot_Nixon_> The ship is also made of wood
[0:51:00] <+krabsan> THATS A MADE UP WORD
[0:51:00] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> FFXIV has ruined me because I can only think of Larboard
[0:51:00] <%Commiekin> starboard is a side
[0:51:08] <$dalmek> @PatStaresAt there's a Glossary at the back of the book
[0:51:10] <%thegreenbenis> BOSUN MATE @PatStaresAt
[0:51:11] <tranquilturnip> Ther's a glossory of terms thankfully
[0:51:11] <%AncelDeLambert> a Bosun is a Quartermaster
[0:51:14] <kozboz96> @Fien111 well pirate talk is commonly associated to robert newton who played long john silver in the 1950s treasure island so ummm i guess dorset?
[0:51:16] <%EyeFarted> SURGERY
[0:51:18] <%Dfreddy8> Would Woolie know?
[0:51:19] <+mczarklesby> I was really gratified to play a game where years of maritime history as a child finally paid off. .
[0:51:20] <filialpails> bosun = boatswain
[0:51:23] <SomeOtherNeb> they DED
[0:51:23] <%dukenux> oh you gonna learn so much maritime lingo
[0:51:23] <%Niney_Who> Yep
[0:51:24] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @Fien111 the middle bits, the rest are okay though.

[0:51:24] <reonome> they be dead
[0:51:26] <%Bt_Robot> Purser is kind of a quartermaster
[0:51:26] <%BinaryFireball> they all skeletons I guess
[0:51:27] <%spiritofmojave> Bitches dead
[0:51:27] <%SuckerPunchSyd> you can look at the jobs at the back of the book
[0:51:27] <%Commiekin> solve every single death
[0:51:27] <Zap_Rowsdower32> DEAD
[0:51:27] <%de1ete_forever> dirty dirty scotts

[0:52:04] <%BinaryFireball> that guy got deaded
[0:52:06] <%ThePuddingDead> and hung him
[0:52:07] <+konekoryugamine> That's what happened to people who commited mutiny
[0:52:07] <%Commiekin> @patpoops italian identity predates italy's unification. like germany.
[0:52:08] <%Dementedpenguin> Jesus.
[0:52:09] <%de1ete_forever> good old mob justice
[0:52:09] <Man_in_the_Red> @spiritofmojave yes, its that far back
[0:52:10] <%Frost_Quill> I don't know any spoilers about this game if I make an accurate guess I didn't know.
[0:52:10] <%NekoUrabe> NekoUrabe is gifting 1 Tier 1 Subs to PatStaresAt's community! They've gifted a total of 31 in the channel! 
[0:52:10] <%dinnydanny777> Wow, firing squad into the ocean
[0:52:11] <%NekoUrabe> NekoUrabe's Gift shared rewards to 5 others in Chat! 
[0:52:11] <%NekoUrabe> NekoUrabe gifted a Tier 1 sub to benjiFG! 
[0:52:11] <krikitbonez> i got pretty far in this game, it is amazing
[0:52:14] <zettig> iirc Formosa = Taiwan
[0:52:14] <@SoFarFetched> They shot him for being so hung
[0:52:15] <tranquilturnip> Firing squad
[0:52:15] <%Fien111> Can't be too sure....
[0:52:15] <%BubbaRands> Sea justice
[0:52:16] <%Pyroclase> that seems unnecessary
[0:52:17] <%dinnydanny777> Shoot him into the ocean
[0:52:18] <Solidnick18> hmmm
[0:52:18] <+troxvon_the_lesser> YEAH FUCK THAT GUY HE PROBABLY DESERVED IT
[0:52:18] <TheBadoe> seems a bit exessive
[0:52:20] <Huntercd> Is this a slave ship?
[0:52:22] <%benjiFG> @NekoUrabe thank u
[0:52:22] <jacob_1909> why would someone shoot a man before throwing him out of a ship
[0:52:23] <%Bailey__gaming> he's just hanging around f
[0:52:24] <Freelance_Astronaut> Yoooo, sick ass execution
[0:52:25] <Darkfire346> Wheres Henry Avery and Thomas Tew?
[0:52:25] <%spiritofmojave> @man_in_the_red interesting stuff :b

[0:52:26] <%Dfreddy8> Who's E.S.?
[0:52:27] <+krabsan> THE DOOM
[0:52:30] <%NekoUrabe> C:
[0:52:30] <King_Wolf_Rigger> I bet his ghost did it
[0:52:30] <%dukenux> yes Formosa is modern Taiwan
[0:52:38] <CyricZ42> Alt. Boatfucker
[0:52:38] <%BubbaRands> booooooook is looooong
[0:52:39] <%dinnydanny777> Fun fact, Francis Drake once executed a man for being a werewolf
[0:52:42] <tranquilturnip> Firing squad is for the people shooting, so no single person feels like they killed the prisoner
[0:52:44] <+konekoryugamine> The guy who would help bring up the sail
[0:52:44] <+mczarklesby> "Bosun" sounds like the Mosin in Mosin-Nagant.
[0:52:45] <yeetdabsenpai69> @jacob_1909 gotta get rid of the body somehow
[0:52:46] <krikitbonez> BOAT SWAIN
[0:52:49] <%BinaryFireball> They probably didnt want to shoot the ship or get rid of the body
[0:52:50] <+senfood> SKULL
[0:52:50] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat, actually READ that glossary, it is important.

[0:54:40] <%CommanderSqueaks> Here goes Pat, immediately assuming things.
[0:54:41] <+Mijymish> ok, but be more specific about the "fd his ass up" or you'll never finish the game
[0:54:43] <%Nupinoop296> just like in Shadowbringers Kappa
[0:54:44] <%Commiekin> ah yes, the darkness that visits everyone in the final minutes of sleep
[0:54:44] <%marsantas> Check out behind the captain!
[0:54:45] <cipher758> shotgunned
[0:54:45] <%Fien111> Imagine if a game like this was just a normal, but well done, murder mystery. Like any other form of media. Why it always gotta be space/time eating demons or some shit?
[0:54:46] <+konekoryugamine> No, "memento mori" is "Remember you can die". "Memento Mortem" is "Remember death"

[0:55:33] <Man_in_the_Red> @jekado basically
[0:55:38] <%Mofirelizard> @PatStaresAt is clearly the Nightman
[0:55:39] <patpoops> this book writes itself
[0:55:46] <%dukenux> btw, thanks @doruben fotr a sub!
[0:55:48] <%StooEsq> this presentation is damn good
[0:55:52] <+konekoryugamine> So they were coming in FROM the Cape of Good Hope.
[0:55:52] <%ThePuddingDead> I wish connor and hank had their own game and did, JUST THIS
[0:55:55] <spacecatstreams> how did they die is usually easy to solve. who is this is ususally hard
[0:55:57] <+Mijymish> the x next to the quote is helpful to remember that the dead person said that
[0:55:58] <%BinaryFireball> he has the hat
[0:55:58] <%medusasghost> this is really cool
[0:56:02] <%UvBenServed> Looks captainy
[0:56:06] <%GeneralSCPatton> Lines marked by an X were said by the dead man
[0:56:10] <%Commiekin> You can identify characters before they're unblurred, but it's extra hard
[0:56:11] <%dukenux> he has the capn hat
[0:56:11] <+konekoryugamine> Or it's the hat
[0:56:11] <%Sol_Install> also the hat
[0:56:12] <CyricZ42> IS IT THO
[0:56:13] <%MidnightBurst12> biggest hat = captain
[0:56:13] <%BinaryFireball> grumpy captain
[0:56:13] <Ragnakawaii> Seeing this game again gives me chills
[0:56:14] <%huskarl_zap> Is this Limbo of the Lost?
[0:56:15] <%Pappajimbo> also has boss hat
[0:56:20] <cipher758> the cap
[0:56:20] <+Mijymish> "can be identified" sometimes feels like real b.s.
[0:56:20] <seainspace> OH SHIT I ALMOST MISSED THIS
[0:56:21] <+konekoryugamine> WOOF
[0:56:22] <CyricZ42> And he has his own breakfast cereal
[0:56:23] <yeetdabsenpai69> and big hat
[0:56:24] <Solidnick18> ooof
[0:56:28] <%joylent_blue> SIXTY
[0:56:32] <%ThePuddingDead> dont do that
[0:56:35] <%spiritofmojave> Sixty unidentified peeps oof

[0:56:37] <+konekoryugamine> So giant logic pouzzle on ship
[0:56:38] <%AncelDeLambert> THAT'S A LIE. EVERYONE HAS CLUES
[0:56:41] <%ThePuddingDead> never pressume ANYTHING in a crime scene
[0:56:42] <spacecatstreams> god i fucking love this game
[0:56:42] <%Frost_Quill> Is the whole game just finding out what happened to these 60 people?

[0:57:52] <+mczarklesby> @delilah4you This moment is the whole reason I'm here.
[0:57:53] <%spiritofmojave> Goblins LARBOARD, Captain! psaGoblin
[0:57:53] <%bread_assassin> When you have three correct fates, the game will confirm them for you.
[0:57:55] <startstoprepeat> finish the tutorial
[0:57:59] <wruce__billis> The game will "lock in" three at a time
[0:58:00] <%TheAsianAvenger96> For each three you get right it will tell you
[0:58:01] <%Klonoa__> paige got a brain
[0:58:03] <TheTunnelSn8ke> Get three identities/deaths correct and the game will notify you.
[0:58:05] <beautyfulman> @PatStaresAt Once you fully identify 3 people, the game will confirm that you were right, and lock them in
[0:58:07] <%marsantas> ANY three right will confirm if you are right
[0:58:07] <%Pappajimbo> arrr these be pirate goblins psaGoblin
[0:58:07] <ScreamLord> When do the Skeleton Pirates come in?
[0:58:08] <TheFramedWarlock> If you get 3 right it locks them in
[0:58:08] <%Klonoa__> doing a big think
[0:58:08] <%ElkRiverDog> psaGoblin_UN
[0:58:09] <bananagourmet> any three identities and the game lock them in, prevents cheesing it

[0:58:15] <KingVantq> Im da cappin
[0:58:15] <Robot_Nixon_> Paige goin in PogChamp
[0:58:18] <%ZE_Count> Paige smart
[0:58:21] <%huskarl_zap> AHHHHHHA THE BLOOD RUNS COLD.
[0:58:23] <%dukenux> might be Bosun
[0:58:23] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> It could be anyone for the others.
[0:58:23] <+OwlLightningMage> WHY IS PAIGE SO FOCUSED
[0:58:24] <+legitimatejohnathan> you're overthinking the chat, keep going or you'll be confused
[0:58:24] <%Undenizen> you don't have enough yet
[0:58:25] <%dinnydanny777> Shirtless in the rain, on a boat
[0:58:25] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Could be bosun
[0:58:25] <%BlueMoonBlues> Paige big smarts
[0:58:26] <%Nupinoop296> this is only the first one, it's fine
[0:58:27] <CyricZ42> Arrrr
[0:58:27] <%BinaryFireball> bald boi
[0:58:27] <Railgun5> @PatStaresAt ZOOM IN WHILE LOOKING AT THE CAPTAIN
[0:58:31] <%dinnydanny777> Shirtless in the rain
[0:58:31] <+Mijymish> but you can fill in the fate without the name
[0:58:31] <TheStarvingGood> hold right mouse button to match their face to their portraits @PatStaresAt
[0:58:32] <%dukenux> or first mate whatever
[0:58:34] <Robot_Nixon_> its all good, takes time to get used to
[0:58:35] <SomeOtherNeb> I'd like to agree with Paige but that thought makes me feel dirty
[0:58:36] <%Nupinoop296> zoom in on people to highlight them
[0:58:36] <%huskarl_zap> WE TAKE OUR LOOT AND DONT GROW OLD.
[0:58:36] <%Commiekin> Each of the characters has a "fate" - who they were, how they died, who or what killed them. When you CORRECTLY record three deaths the game jumps in and says "hey you got these three fates right"
[0:58:37] <%Joustar_> Paige is.... actually helping??
[0:58:38] <%BinaryFireball> whats in his mouth?
[0:58:42] <patpoops> knife mouth

[0:58:50] <%President_Miyazaki> President_Miyazaki subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 28 months! Surely this stream will go well and not cause any headaches for viewers or player.
[0:58:51] <TheTunnelSn8ke> Yeah, you can zoom in and the game focuses on who they are in the two sketches
[0:58:54] <+Mijymish> @BinaryFireball a knife

[0:59:15] <%GingerStrawhat> I could have sworn it was four
[0:59:16] <+Freelance7> It's three
[0:59:21] <mrblack499> he going to have to use brain
[0:59:22] <%GingerStrawhat> Oh well
[0:59:22] <%SuckerPunchSyd> i dont think he can get behind the capitan yet
[0:59:22] <%Commiekin> hats are important, on ships
[0:59:26] <%AncelDeLambert> NEW HET
[0:59:27] <+konekoryugamine> Paige is right
[0:59:27] <%BinaryFireball> the bosun or first mate?
[0:59:27] <+Mijymish> or cold ears
[0:59:27] <cipher758> goblins defeated
[0:59:30] <%thegreenbenis> Wow Paige with big brain
[0:59:30] <%nmaten> a hat is the sign of a hat
[0:59:31] <KingVantq> Tiny hat=big status
[0:59:32] <%Pappajimbo> only important people get hats
[0:59:32] <Karhax> q to go back to first page
[0:59:32] <%Th3SmartAlec> It's a sign of Pat's fetish
[0:59:33] <%Undenizen> they could easily have lost their hats.
[0:59:33] <%CommanderSqueaks> HAT means IMPORTANT
[0:59:34] <+CarlosEoM> like TF2
[0:59:34] <%SirGO0SE> a little hat is a sign of hot
[0:59:35] <Robot_Nixon_> hats make me feel important :)
[0:59:35] <%dukenux> yeah but its not a pimpin hat like capn's
[0:59:36] <+konekoryugamine> What about the sneak on the stairs?
[0:59:36] <%ThePuddingDead> prolly capt, first mate
[0:59:41] <%BinaryFireball> Paige Big Brain
[0:59:42] <tranquilturnip> its the other way around, hats are naturally drawn to people of status to roost
[0:59:43] <patpoops> and a sign of good fashion
[0:59:44] <TheFramedWarlock> Paige going in
[0:59:44] <%Frost_Quill> What the fuck Paige. You're so focused today. What the hell.
[0:59:45] <%bread_assassin> Hat's are the most expensive article of clothing.
[0:59:48] <Freelance_Astronaut> I think we should get off the boat and die of small pox, just get it over with.
[0:59:56] <%spiritofmojave> Fashion is status PogChamp
[0:59:58] <%Joustar_> What status does a tiny hat give them Pat?
[0:59:59] <+Taglog7> People with hats like status and crime
[1:00:01] <%bread_assassin> But not impossible.
[1:00:01] <CyricZ42> Don't be unproductive PAT
[1:00:04] <+mczarklesby> 'May'. Not 'is'.
[1:00:06] <%MidnightBurst12> people went crazy making hats
[1:00:08] <+krabsan> THIS IS IMPORTANT
[1:00:08] <%GeneralSCPatton> You can get some of them right even while blurred
[1:00:08] <%SuckerPunchSyd> but you do know how they died
[1:00:09] <bananagourmet> you can still do it though
[1:00:12] <%AncelDeLambert> this is THE BEST
[1:00:13] <+konekoryugamine> So you can say how they died, but you can't name them without the right information.
[1:00:13] <%Th3SmartAlec> PogChamp
[1:00:14] <+konekoryugamine> DOPE
[1:00:15] <+Mijymish> If you're REALLY sure, you can go ahead and fill in their name even if blurred
[1:00:18] <%Klonoa__> there are so many death options
[1:00:18] <%ThePuddingDead> its like a dark souls comment section
[1:00:20] <%AncelDeLambert> I love how THOROUGH it is
[1:00:21] <shevan123> @patstaresat they also have descriptions of different positions at the back of the book
[1:00:21] <Man_in_the_Red> lots of verbs, some of them are never used
[1:00:24] <%marsantas> CRUSHED BY BEAST!
[1:00:25] <%dukenux> What status does GET SMOKED cap speak
[1:00:28] <+Mijymish> oh, and some of these verbs are so annoying

[1:22:40] <%Nupinoop296> the atmosphere in this game is GREAT

[1:22:44] <%thelonechris> Doritos in one hands, mouse in the other
[1:22:44] <%Onmi_Khaos> Just a reminder that this is a game about investigating a not-haunted ship to figure out what happened to the crew, we are in no danger at all, and yet, we are fucking ENGROSSED
[1:22:45] <CyricZ42> That dude's kinda all over
[1:22:47] <%spiritofmojave> psaCanada DoritosChip

[1:24:37] <%Commiekin> Who is this? Some chump. How did they die? Painfully.
[1:24:40] <%ZE_Count> its true
[1:24:41] <%aishman> Did we get his name?
[1:24:42] <%Parapattern> They died SUPER RAD

[1:24:48] <%MidnightBurst12> yep
[1:24:49] <lesserkarl> who murdered this innocent kraken?
[1:24:50] <%Pyroclase> would that count as a suicide?
[1:24:51] <narusao> he 'sploded
[1:24:51] <%dashmatt> This unknown bitch
[1:24:52] <brachydios777> These dudes got fucked
[1:24:52] <%spiritofmojave> Local POOR SOUL exploded
[1:24:55] <Csagets> There's some wipeouts in this game
[1:24:57] <librettodude> @televisedrevolting i'm not so sure, they're circular but not curved like a celt tatt
[1:25:00] <ThDark> Wasn't there a name in the memory?
[1:25:03] <%Joustar_> boi got BLASTED
[1:25:05] <%thelonechris> Went out like a boss
[1:25:07] <%Monkeyweed21> the guy with all the guns is probably quartermaster
[1:25:08] <narusao> he went out with a bang
[1:25:08] <%SuckerPunchSyd> boy howdy
[1:25:09] <%espanishcanamurciana> WHAT WAS THAT!?
[1:25:11] <%aishman> @PatStaresAt Didn't the memory say a name?
[1:25:12] <spacecatstreams> i dont think so guys
[1:25:13] <%TheBitingIrish> Focus on them, Pat
[1:25:14] <tranquilturnip> Explosions like that probably don't hurt at least
[1:25:16] <%weissguard> This poor, unFORTUNATE SOOOUUULLL
[1:25:16] <%de1ete_forever> this is what happens when u let Celts on ur ship, nothin but fist fights and mythical monster fights
[1:25:18] <Man_in_the_Red> @pyroclase no, he was grabbed, and they blew him up along with the tentacle
[1:25:18] <%dinnydanny777> The door is floating
[1:25:20] <Radski5> Kablamsos. No more Amadama.
[1:25:20] <%Chatterbox1991> @PatStaresAt look at the crew list and check for Nordic names, that ight be your tattoo man
[1:25:23] <CrimsonFox777> @espanishcanamurciana The kraken or the explosion?
[1:25:29] <+Mijymish> Not nordic or celtic
[1:25:32] <SomeOtherNeb> aight I'm off to bed, this game is great but I'm too tired to enjoy it properly
[1:25:32] <FullMetalEmblem> lol gamer and his doritoes
[1:25:34] <%Chatterbox1991> you think?
[1:25:38] <shotgang86> psaCrazyhand
[1:25:40] <CyricZ42> Martin: WHATUP!
[1:25:41] <%heartlesshealer> What was she yelling to Martin?
[1:25:41] <+AWanderingKenku> Apparently tattoo guy is identifiable???
[1:25:52] <%heartlesshealer> Martin Perrot
[1:25:52] <televisedrevolting> @librettodude Fair point. Most of what I know about the celts come from Anime and assorted videos on the internet.
[1:25:53] <%aishman> THIRD MATE
[1:25:56] <+Mijymish> @Chatterbox1991 I know. I'm trying not to be annoying about it
[1:25:57] <%Mr_Pylon> #4
[1:25:59] <Tisaric> tattoo guy is a 2 star identify so it's a bit hard
[1:26:00] <%thegreenbenis> 4
[1:26:01] <Karhax> missed one, #4
[1:26:01] <TheFramedWarlock> Just remember clear portrait means you can name them

[1:26:03] <+trekkie11041> blind
[1:26:03] <%TheBitingIrish> doodwesker
[1:26:04] <%dinnydanny777> This is a very multinational ship you know
[1:26:05] <+legitimatejohnathan> his tattoos are cultural, so you _could_ figure it out
[1:26:05] <%heartlesshealer> Only one
[1:26:09] <%aishman> Third Mate
[1:26:09] <+krabsan> 1

[1:26:31] <SirDogBear> 3rd mate? thats for sure a hat. Nice hat? Hard to tell
[1:26:32] <+brightman42> realistically there'd probably be like 5 Mikes
[1:26:35] <%heartlesshealer> what did lady say? might be clue on which dead man was Martin
[1:26:40] <%benjiFG> willem dafoe?
[1:26:40] <%ZE_Count> left
[1:26:45] <CyricZ42> Dude on the left
[1:26:45] <%GingerStrawhat> What about that guy to the captains left
[1:26:48] <CyricZ42> Or whatever
[1:26:49] <%aishman> Go to the memory
[1:26:49] <%AncelDeLambert> psaBlind psaBlind psaBlind
[1:26:50] <%Klonoa__> left of cap too tho
[1:26:52] <TheTunnelSn8ke> It's all about them hats.
[1:26:55] <%aishman> You don't have to go to the corpse to view the memory dude
[1:26:56] <Kojixif> psaBlind
[1:26:57] <+mczarklesby> shhh
[1:26:57] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Plenty of hats.
[1:27:03] <%garbocardboardington> Oof
[1:27:09] <%ZE_Count> zoom
[1:27:10] <beautyfulman> @PatStaresAt You really gotta remember the bit about the photo being unblurred meaning you have everything you need
[1:27:10] <%espanishcanamurciana> I was thinking the same thing @PatStaresAt
[1:27:10] <%SuckerPunchSyd> i like how it does the quick enter
[1:27:11] <CyricZ42> WHATUP
[1:27:16] <%heartlesshealer> beard and coat
[1:27:21] <%thelonechris> There's many dudes with beards
[1:27:23] <%TheBitingIrish> @PatStaresAt You can revisit memories from each person in the photo
[1:27:25] <TheTunnelSn8ke> Hatless, but that's him
[1:27:25] <%Piemen99> nice
[1:27:26] <seainspace> insane that this was made by a single guy
[1:27:28] <+ShinBojangles> pat needs to zoom zoom more
[1:27:31] <+waltzqueen> That's the bitch!
[1:27:34] <amask777> notice the upper guys all dress the same
[1:27:34] <%MelBrooksKA> The heck is this?
[1:27:35] <CyricZ42> I hope they throw his hatless butt in jail
[1:27:35] <%marsantas> Hats and uniforms are IMPORTANT
[1:27:38] <%MayorRev> Pat was the origami killer
[1:27:38] <%ZE_Count> Always zoom pat
[1:27:41] <+lbCyber> Lucas Pope made the music, too
[1:27:45] <%rasterman> if the face is clear, you have enough info to identify
[1:27:47] <tonfirean> He zoomed but the body blocked the view.
[1:27:49] <SirDogBear> Star Fleet wishes it got cool hats like this
[1:27:49] <Tisaric> almost everything about the person is important for some things
[1:27:51] <%espanishcanamurciana> So this is the Bloodborne DLC
[1:27:52] <%GingerStrawhat> I can never remember what the triangles mean, is it difficulty to solve?
[1:27:57] <reonome> yes
[1:27:58] <wruce__billis> If you read Hopratio HJronblower as a kid this game becomes so much easier
[1:27:59] <noahjpvd> How you liking this so far?
[1:28:03] <%cureneckbeard> DoritosChip
[1:28:05] <%AncelDeLambert> @GingerStrawhat yes
[1:28:05] <%MidnightBurst12> not the same hat
[1:28:06] <Tisaric> yeah triangles are difficulty
[1:28:06] <+Kiltedpunk> Kiltedpunk subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[1:28:08] <Radski5> Is that the Polar Express conductor?
[1:28:09] <+Mijymish> "enough to identify" by the game's standards
[1:28:11] <+brightman42> some clear faces are difficult af tho
[1:28:12] <%GingerStrawhat> Okay yeah
[1:28:19] <patpoops> that dude has a honker
[1:28:20] <Tisaric> I think triangles can go down with more info as well
[1:28:23] <+brightman42> this one's hard
[1:28:24] <Tisaric> it's kind of cool like that
[1:28:24] <%huskarl_zap> When do we get past the mates and get to the BRUVS
[1:28:28] <reonome> that guy is hard to solve
[1:28:28] <%aishman> It's like in a memory
[1:28:29] <%AncelDeLambert> tattoo
[1:28:29] <%thegreenbenis> TATTOOS
[1:28:31] <%aishman> Someone said a name
[1:28:32] <%Roundelay11> look for celtic style names in the register
[1:28:33] <%ZE_Count> tats man
[1:28:33] <%SuckerPunchSyd> yeah this ones a doosie
[1:28:33] <librettodude> If you're familiar with the tattoos, maybe
[1:28:34] <%Commiekin> He's a three triangle, meaning basically some incidental detail reveals his identity
[1:28:35] <startstoprepeat> be racist and you'll work it out
[1:28:35] <+mczarklesby> OK don't tell him. :D
[1:28:36] <%aishman> ALso tattooes
[1:28:42] <+krabsan> nationalities :)
[1:28:42] <CuttleCrow> just cause its clear doesn't mean its going to be esy
[1:28:43] <%thegreenbenis> lOOK AT THE TATS
[1:28:44] <beautyfulman> @PatStaresAt So, this is the key distinction, the unblurring means you have been given everything the GAME will tell you
[1:28:45] <+Freelance7> Quiet guys
[1:28:47] <%joylent_blue> chat don't give it all away lol
[1:28:47] <+brightman42> above their pics
[1:28:49] <Andrizzleton> new guinea tatts
[1:28:50] <%PettyFunk> I don't think those tattoos are Celtic, guys
[1:28:51] <+brightman42> click it
[1:28:53] <%Parapattern> It says their nationalities on the manifest
[1:28:54] <%Commiekin> Click on them and look at the portrait
[1:28:54] <+MrAristocrates> in da book under the pictures
[1:28:54] <%GingerStrawhat> On the character cards
[1:28:56] <%thegreenbenis> Tats
[1:28:56] <%xxmagonx> Arm
[1:28:57] <librettodude> triangles above his entry in the manifest
[1:28:59] <AFewGoodTaters> i got tattoo boy from an episode of futurama
[1:29:03] <+Ominnous> TheIlluminati
[1:29:06] <%Commiekin> Oh is he a two triangle? thought he was a three
[1:29:08] <beautyfulman> @PatStaresAt The rest is up to you, some people you will HAVE to make an assumption to solve them
[1:29:09] <+blurblewurble> guys shut the fuck up and let him work things out
[1:29:09] <@StridentSong> You won't be able to solve everything immediately. There's even chapters in The Doom you won't have enough information for until near the end
[1:29:16] <+Mijymish> Gonna have to make some assumptions about them nationalities
[1:29:20] <CyricZ42> Let's go dig up some more bodies gang!
[1:29:22] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Stridents right
[1:29:23] <Saltmeisterr> god this game is fooking rad
[1:29:29] <%huskarl_zap> psaBig TheIlluminati
[1:29:29] <atgithursdays> Eat the Doritos faster, tiny ginger man
[1:29:35] <tonfirean> I would double-check Martin, since there were two guys with beards, and you had the other one in mind as third mate when you were looking at the picture before.
[1:29:36] <%aishman> What the fuck is that
[1:29:37] <AFewGoodTaters> Racism is a legit strat here
[1:29:46] <King_Wolf_Rigger> what the hell is that?
[1:29:46] <%UvBenServed> Shiny
[1:29:46] <Tisaric> you can change the color scheme as well, I love the art style but some people hate it
[1:29:47] <%cvp5127> gotta profile
[1:29:49] <reonome> I want dorites
[1:29:55] <%dinnydanny777> Maybe it's a kraken
[1:29:59] <Zap_Rowsdower32> FORESHADOWING
[1:30:00] <Mr_Strut> Is that a fucking portal?
[1:30:03] <noahjpvd> Thoughts on the game so far?
[1:30:04] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> english hatin on the scots?
[1:30:07] <%ringabal> Shits locked
[1:30:08] <Robot_Nixon_> but who was kraken then?
[1:30:10] <%Commiekin> X on the lock means you can't open it
[1:30:12] <%joylent_blue> noahjpvd radical
[1:30:28] <librettodude> two sets of eyes, two brain
[1:30:30] <+Mijymish> flies mean bodies
[1:30:34] <CyricZ42> Let's put on some Old Spice and go below decks
[1:30:34] <%Bt_Robot> YOU MISSED A DOOR

[1:35:30] <%de1ete_forever> this is just an Alestorm album cover
[1:35:31] <Radski5> Why would the Karken do this?
[1:35:35] <+PenmanLupine> now to solve the mystery of the disappearing hat
[1:35:36] <+stealthyProboscis> Octopus with a cannon is the most dangerous thing in the world, probably
[1:35:38] <%ZE_Count> KRAKEN HAS LEARNED POWER OF GUN!
[1:35:38] <madskull456> man these guys are getting it rough
[1:35:40] <silverira> GUN TRICK SWORD!

[1:35:59] <%Mr_Pylon> So many corpses
[1:36:02] <@SoFarFetched> The kraken was just trying to say "hat's off to you sir" but apparently did it literally
[1:36:02] <%Parapattern> Obliterated
[1:36:02] <shotgang86> so the kraken got a hat?

[1:36:55] <%MidnightBurst12> yep
[1:36:55] <wruce__billis> liability claims are serious business
[1:36:55] <%Commiekin> insurance fraud is a serious crime
[1:36:57] <%EyeFarted> IT'S BIG MONEY PAIGE
[1:36:57] <%ZE_Count> yeah insurance be cra cra
[1:37:00] <madskull456> its magic insurance
[1:37:00] <CandideCamera> East India Company takes their insurance reports seriously
[1:37:01] <TheTunnelSn8ke> Lucas Pope knows how to make the mundane become outstanding
[1:37:01] <Radski5> Gotta fuel the hustle.
[1:37:02] <%cvp5127> its a living
[1:37:03] <Ragnakawaii> East Indian Trading Company is not to be messed with
[1:37:03] <SirDogBear> insurance fraud is a war crime you didn't know?
[1:37:06] <%walternatorz> yeah, I wouldn't mess with the east india company
[1:37:06] <TheTunnelSn8ke> See: Papers Please
[1:37:07] <%thelonechris> "Sorry, your insurance doesn't cover sick-ass headshots with cannons."
[1:37:07] <TheBadoe> you gotta be accurate

[1:37:22] <Fear_Ranjer> JESUS CHRIST
[1:37:24] <+moonseas4> is anyone even left alive to claim insurance LUL
[1:37:25] <SGrim> At this point I think the phrase "The whole ship got fucked by a Kraken" could suffice as an explanation.
[1:37:25] <%ringabal> More like Obra Dire
[1:37:26] <%Dfreddy8> CRUSHED
[1:37:26] <kingra> What crushed him.
[1:37:28] <librettodude> I wonder if Lucas Pope looked at the word "Mortgage" and slammed the table in realization
[1:37:28] <%spiritofmojave> Obra Dinn should've gotten the Kraken plan smh
[1:37:29] <%Idziman> DO YOU HAVE KRAKEN INSURANCE
[1:37:30] <%dashmatt> Yeah but does their policy cover krakens????
[1:37:30] <+MrAristocrates> oh, yep, the dude was stuck to the cannon

[1:37:32] <gryffinp> This is the best luxury cruise ever
[1:37:38] <%BubbaRands> *squish*
[1:37:38] <%GingerStrawhat> So maybe it was that guy who killed him
[1:37:40] <%Mr_Pylon> guy 2!
[1:37:41] <%benjiFG> point blank damn
[1:37:43] <Mr_Strut> I think you could call this an act of god the moment the kraken appeared
[1:37:44] <%dashmatt> KRAKEN KOVERAGE
[1:37:44] <%ChaosAethr> OH SHIT WRONG END TO BE ON
[1:37:44] <Man_in_the_Red> 2 guys got shot, AND this guy gets caught in the cannon
[1:37:46] <yeetdabsenpai69> @thelonechris does it cover NORMAL headshots with a cannon?
[1:37:46] <%de1ete_forever> the 6 billion double dollar kraken
[1:37:47] <gryffinp> @moonseas4 mostly I think it's about the rich landlubbers who owned the boat and it's cargo
[1:37:47] <%ZE_Count> kraken are scary
[1:37:49] <%garbocardboardington> GUY 2!
[1:37:52] <$Caped_Eggy> Kraken's doing more work than cap
[1:37:52] <%MidnightBurst12> double kill with the cannon
[1:37:53] <%ZE_Count> blown up
[1:37:53] <+Taglog7> Tacoma wen?
[1:37:54] <Radski5> The Kraken had an accomplice aboard. TRAITOR!
[1:37:54] <tranquilturnip> I wonder if Westworld would create a "killed by kraken" simulator
[1:37:56] <%dukenux> Pat!
[1:37:56] <+krabsan> MIST
[1:37:57] <+brightman42> blood mist
[1:38:00] <%KoiRedd> Is the Kraken an act of God?
[1:38:01] <DashXero> Krakens don't shoot people. People shoot people.
[1:38:01] <+Solutha> two ppl at the end of that cannon there
[1:38:02] <Saltmeisterr> THE DOUBLE
[1:38:02] <startstoprepeat> in a wide area
[1:38:02] <%maskedriderhero> it stopped existing
[1:38:03] <delerim001> in pieces
[1:38:04] <+Mijymish> listen to the audio cues in the previous memory
[1:38:05] <shotgang86> WutFace WutFace WutFace WutFace WutFace
[1:38:05] <zedravan> stumbo
[1:38:05] <cipher758> kraken is cleaning house
[1:38:07] <Karhax> those are the two that you just looked at
[1:38:08] <Mr_Strut> Kraken's gonna shoot his dick
[1:38:09] <%realm_forge> That Kraken is John Wick
[1:38:10] <wruce__billis> He's right next to a gunport pat use your head
[1:38:10] <+Mijymish> and you will know where the body is
[1:38:11] <%Nupinoop296> i agree, Tacoma when
[1:38:30] <shotgang86> psaBougie
[1:38:35] <%thegreenbenis> CANNON
[1:38:36] <%ZE_Count> now Kraken has a gun it changes everything
[1:38:37] <%TheBitingIrish> no
[1:38:41] <%Frost_Quill> Cannon
[1:38:42] <%Faustgesicht> It counts
[1:38:43] <Tisaric> Is tacoma kind of like this? I was put off by the walking sim tag a bit
[1:38:44] <%xxmagonx> No
[1:38:44] <%dashmatt> I want an insurance policy that covers being shot by a kraken
[1:38:44] <Saltmeisterr> Cannon?
[1:38:44] <%AncelDeLambert> cannon and beast are both valid
[1:38:46] <%ergulor> By a beast of by a cannon?
[1:38:46] <%de1ete_forever> speaking of Beast Wars
[1:38:47] <%MidnightBurst12> it works
[1:38:47] <%SuckerPunchSyd> it counts yall
[1:38:47] <%Frost_Quill> Or it might count.
[1:38:47] <SubjectX07x> The audio is fucking horrific for pretty much all of these.
[1:38:47] <%Piemen99> wouldnt have been a cannon?
[1:38:47] <%toastybites> The boat is the Schindler's List to the Kraken's John Wick
[1:38:49] <%Commiekin> the game's more lenient than you're giving it credit for
[1:38:49] <%thegreenbenis> Fair
[1:38:51] <ShinMaddrox> Pretty sure it was the cannon that crushed him
[1:38:52] <+Mijymish> so... where do you think his body went?
[1:38:53] <tonfirean> Chat, let him get things wrong and go back and fix them.
[1:38:55] <%ChaosAethr> This crew got all kinds of Fucked up
[1:38:55] <+brightman42> maybe?
[1:39:00] <tranquilturnip> That guy either got knocked out of the ship or obliterated LUL
[1:39:06] <Lophostrix_> LOOK OUT THE WINDOW IN THE OTHER MEMORY
[1:39:07] <%garbocardboardington> Guy 2 prolly also shot by cannon?
[1:39:10] <%schlager087> schlager087 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months! 6 Months have gone by so quick, thanks for being a funny giant baby man to give me much needed mental breaks when my actual baby takes a nap
[1:39:10] <+Freelance7> Let him figure things out. No hints
[1:39:10] <+krabsan> @PatStaresAt he turned o dust :)
[1:39:11] <%huskarl_zap> psaBougie psaBlind
[1:39:12] <%UvBenServed> SHOT THROUGH THE HEART
[1:39:12] <%Nupinoop296> essentially both were blasted to hell
[1:39:13] <%MayorRev> If pat gets things wrong he's gonna hyperventilate again
[1:39:13] <+brightman42> yep
[1:39:13] <%ringabal> Being on the Obra Din is suffering
[1:39:15] <shotgang86> So there are no survivors huh
[1:39:15] <narusao> does insurance cover kraken attacks?
[1:39:15] <%Mr_Pylon> take a look at the other vision?
[1:39:18] <+stealthyProboscis> I think "by a beast" or "by a cannon" both count as correct here. The game isn't extremely picky about that.
[1:39:19] <%AncelDeLambert> Chunky salsa
[1:39:19] <wruce__billis> There are actually two completely different answerrs for that guy and the game counts both as correct
[1:39:20] <MillaMoks> didnt you find he legs
[1:39:21] <%TheBitingIrish> Focus on them, Pat
[1:39:23] <tranquilturnip> He's one of the harder ones too I think
[1:39:25] <%MSN04_Sazabi> This is like Das Boot except at the end of the movie instead of Allied bombers it was a fucking kraken
[1:39:26] <MillaMoks> his legs*
[1:39:27] <%Pyroclase> Yes that's right
[1:39:29] <%UvBenServed> Basically
[1:39:29] <$dalmek> you're just some dude
[1:39:30] <Man_in_the_Red> its the clock
[1:39:30] <%Mister_McDerp> yes
[1:39:30] <%Nupinoop296> only the watch is magic
[1:39:31] <%spiritofmojave> I guess so
[1:39:31] <%ZE_Count> You find out later
[1:39:31] <gryffinp> More or less
[1:39:32] <librettodude> You're a Company Mortgage Man
[1:39:32] <DashXero> He was either blasted into hell or getting the best beej from a cannon.
[1:39:33] <%Klonoa__> Chief inspector is my understanding?
[1:39:33] <%Roundelay11> a claimsman that was sent a magical clock
[1:39:34] <%SuckerPunchSyd> pretty much
[1:39:35] <Saltmeisterr> obra dinn is suffering meguca
[1:39:35] <narusao> act of god i guess
[1:39:35] <%MidnightBurst12> There are multiple ways to list a death.
[1:39:38] <+mczarklesby> Actually Paige all claims adjusters get these watches.
[1:39:38] <+MrAristocrates> you're a normal insurance claimsman who got sent a magic watch
[1:39:39] <%dinnydanny777> Insurance Claimsman with a Stand
[1:39:39] <%MayorRev> YOU'RE not magical, the watch is
[1:39:40] <%Monkeyweed21> just a normal insurance agents
[1:39:40] <%ringabal> "It's my first day!"
[1:39:40] <Mr_Rakjo> Character is not magical i think just the clock
[1:39:41] <%Commiekin> Yes. You're an insurance claimsman with a mcguffin watch
[1:39:42] <SirDogBear> hes an insurance claimsman that was provided magic
[1:39:42] <+krabsan> He got the clock with the letter
[1:39:42] <%de1ete_forever> Basically a Christopher Nolan pirate movie
[1:39:42] <Karhax> you can see the location of a body on the page
[1:39:44] <%Piemen99> oh ok im wrong then
[1:39:45] <%huskarl_zap> the CCC
[1:39:50] <%dinnydanny777> Insurance Claimsman who can use Stopza

[1:40:06] <%Faustgesicht> Insurance claimsmen who recieved a magic watch from someone who wants you to investigate
[1:40:07] <+brightman42> as long as they're close enough
[1:40:07] <+mczarklesby> He died WITH cannon, not OF cannon.
[1:40:07] <%bugz_munny> The book has a map of the ship with all the section names
[1:40:09] <%Idziman> He's a professional
[1:40:10] <%dukenux> crunchy
[1:40:10] <%Frost_Quill> Can you open the doors?
[1:40:11] <gryffinp> it's a little unclear how normal magic is in this setting
[1:40:12] <sophienatorz_unite> fate extra CCC
[1:40:12] <%schlager087> this seems fine
[1:40:13] <Radski5> I'll never get used to that sound.

[1:41:21] <%rasterman> can't open the door?
[1:41:23] <%cvp5127> give her the controller
[1:41:23] <%Piemen99> The door to the next room?
[1:41:23] <Ultimatefool> BABA IS WINDOW
[1:41:23] <%OmegaWeltall> How can this BE?!
[1:41:25] <RutilusMonachus> Just climb out of the window
[1:41:27] <Lophostrix_> zoom?
[1:41:28] <Radski5> But who is baba?
[1:41:29] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> that troll giggle
[1:41:29] <%NekoUrabe> what about above
[1:41:30] <%ZE_Count> zoom on bodys
[1:41:30] <noahjpvd> Try hard die hard
[1:41:34] <Saltmeisterr> wow that killsthe bitrate
[1:41:34] <+stealthyProboscis> Zoom to see if you can get it to show
[1:41:35] <%bugz_munny> Keep on movin
[1:41:39] <+Mijymish> make sure to listen to all the audio, not just the talking
[1:41:42] <+brightman42> they died in the same instant
[1:41:43] <BlacSoul> click everywhere
[1:41:45] <Fear_Ranjer> So he either launched out of the window or broke through the wall into the other room
[1:41:46] <%bugz_munny> Keep checking shit off
[1:41:50] <%ZE_Count> remember zoom pat
[1:41:51] <+MrAristocrates> oh, the corpse is straight-up missing from the map, yeah, it got destroyed
[1:41:51] <+Mijymish> they put so much effort into the gore sounds
[1:41:55] <+stealthyProboscis> They're visible in the memory of the guy getting crushed
[1:42:04] <%Commiekin> wait until you discover the sound they put the MOST effort into
[1:42:07] <%garbocardboardington> Remember, the game said you would have to make assumptions to solve everything!
[1:42:08] <%UvBenServed> Don't worry about it
[1:42:08] <%de1ete_forever> crack in dat ass
[1:42:10] <%AncelDeLambert> things get thrown overboard
[1:42:11] <%bugz_munny> process of elimination helps immensely so just keep filling in shit
[1:42:12] <gryffinp> maybe the bits got et by seagulls
[1:42:12] <+Mijymish> kraken probably pushed the ship back to England
[1:42:13] <%de1ete_forever> nailed it
[1:42:15] <+brightman42> I think there's like a 4 year gap or something
[1:42:16] <%Frost_Quill> Meat probably got eaten by birds.
[1:42:17] <gryffinp> no bones left in a tentacle
[1:42:17] <%Mister_McDerp> maybe they ate it
[1:42:20] <%Piemen99> boooo
[1:42:22] <Man_in_the_Red> theres 4 chapters after the Doom, theres time to clean up
[1:42:22] <%ringabal> Sleeping next to a cannon? Rough
[1:42:23] <AFewGoodTaters> Kappa
[1:42:26] <%BubbaRands> ghost kraken
[1:42:27] <%rasterman> weird place for a canon
[1:42:27] <+stealthyProboscis> The two guys right in front of the cannon are the ones who got shot by it
[1:42:30] <TheTunnelSn8ke> Geez, imagine whomever manning that cannon being woken up by it.
[1:42:32] <%huskarl_zap> Squid1 Squid2 Squid2 Squid2 Squid2 psaOrange Squid4
[1:42:34] <%AncelDeLambert> nothing but a necklace
[1:42:37] <%toastybites> 1804
[1:42:39] <+Mijymish> smells like BLOOD
[1:42:40] <$dalmek> it's 1807, and the ship got lost in 1803
[1:42:41] <%dashmatt> FREE CALAMARI
[1:42:44] <%Nupinoop296> it's a mystery~
[1:42:46] <Radski5> Long enough to have skeletons
[1:42:46] <gryffinp> That guy looks like he had a bad time
[1:42:47] <+MrAristocrates> hi mr skellington
[1:42:48] <%AncelDeLambert> @PatStaresAt ship was lost at sea for three years
[1:42:48] <%Pyroclase> it wasn't in port, it was adrift, wasn't it?
[1:42:53] <Dreigun> if all the people have desiccated into skeletons, I imagine a boneless tentacle's probably long gone
[1:42:53] <wruce__billis> dun DUN
[1:42:55] <+wellshuckit> @PatStaresAt the other corpse was under the canon on the other side of the wall, with the other men, he was thrown from teh canon going trough the wall.
[1:42:55] <%Commiekin> Yeah, it was adrift
[1:42:56] <%KoiRedd> Looks pretty tidy all things considered..
[1:42:56] <%dukenux> wasnt it found drifting and hauled back
[1:42:57] <%Faustgesicht> OCH

[1:43:02] <%marsantas> Well it was already pointed in the right direction, tides would take it
[1:43:05] <OozieStream> 4~5 years ago
[1:43:05] <AThing_> Accents very important
[1:43:06] <PROUD2beGINGER> Long enough for bodies to turn to skeletons
[1:43:07] <%dukenux> BibleThump
[1:43:09] <+stealthyProboscis> That's a lot of blood still on the floor around a skeleton
[1:43:12] <%redrins> and his name is JOHN AMERICA
[1:43:12] <%Klonoa__> oooh peach smart enough to pick up on accents!

[1:43:21] <CoffeeSlice> FeelsBadMan
[1:43:23] <%PettyFunk> Did Pat look at the glossary so he knows what terms like "midshipman" mean?
[1:43:23] <Fear_Ranjer> A murder??
[1:43:24] <%SubjectTea> is paige's ass still broken?
[1:43:25] <%ha2ken> Tell Pete's mother I love her

[1:43:37] <%de1ete_forever> racist
[1:43:39] <+brightman42> who is scottish
[1:43:39] <%Klonoa__> Man when peach wants to pay attention she GETS it, man
[1:43:41] <+stealthyProboscis> @PettyFunk He's looked at the glossary before
[1:43:47] <%king_wragles> I forgot Paige can decipher accents, should make things a bit easier
[1:43:49] <gryffinp> This game basically DEMANDS you be racist
[1:43:50] <+FatherGreyBeard> JESUS
[1:43:53] <+mczarklesby> Hahaha, yes.
[1:43:55] <%AncelDeLambert> I LOVE THIS GAAAAAAAAAME!
[1:43:56] <doctordotdj> that's all his blood lmao
[1:43:56] <%bendatron> i have more questions about why the ship is in such good condition post kraken

[1:44:01] <TheTunnelSn8ke> That is a LOT of blood.
[1:44:01] <%UvBenServed> What's that smell?
[1:44:02] <Radski5> Don't know whats worse, dying to blood loss or dying Scottish.
[1:44:02] <+Mijymish> yeah, but the scottish one isn't the dying one here. the "transcript" will have an x next to who's dead
[1:44:02] <gryffinp> Racism is required for 100% completion
[1:44:04] <AThing_> @gryffinp I think I know the part you're talking about
[1:44:05] <%bugz_munny> RACISM IS A MECHANIC
[1:44:06] <+wellshuckit> he very dead.
[1:44:06] <%vaporousTippler> That amount of blood demanded an emergency Dorito.
[1:44:09] <%ZE_Count> looks around and zoom on faces!
[1:44:11] <%ringabal> This man is bleeding, making him the victor
[1:44:12] <%Dfreddy8> IT'S BLUUUUD
[1:44:12] <+Taglog7> I'm giving it all she's got, captain!
[1:44:12] <%cvp5127> racism is a feature
[1:44:16] <%joylent_blue> Radski5 LUL
[1:44:20] <gryffinp> @AThing_ What "Part", there's like seven!
[1:44:20] <Freelance_Astronaut> Racism is a speed running strat
[1:44:22] <%espanishcanamurciana> Slam me pregnant til I cry Cloud - Paige
[1:44:22] <+Grayhammatter> jesus, that's a lot of blood
[1:44:24] <%Frost_Quill> Is Brennan the guy running down or the guy listening?
[1:44:24] <%goatbait> thay's waaaaaaaaaaaaaay too much blood
[1:44:24] <startstoprepeat> this is why i didn't care when pat said he's spoiled, there's too much going on to get spoiled
[1:44:25] <%bread_assassin> If it's not a shadow puzzle, Paige ain't half bad.
[1:44:25] <%BubbaRands> Was he 90% blood LUL
[1:44:26] <+brightman42> this is fun
[1:44:29] <silverira> the schindler list of video games!
[1:44:29] <%dukenux> "hellooo"
[1:44:32] <%SuckerPunchSyd> god theres so many bodies
[1:44:33] <%Piemen99> There's not enough blood in the human body for that trail
[1:44:35] <AThing_> @gryffinp I'm thinking the chinese crewmen, not the taiwanese
[1:44:42] <TheTunnelSn8ke> That is more blood than a human body can even let.
[1:44:44] <+stealthyProboscis> That's the guy who got his throat cut by the captain
[1:44:44] <%Dfreddy8> "is it me your looking for"
[1:44:49] <%bugz_munny> The chinese are the hardest in the game to identify for me lol
[1:44:50] <+wellshuckit> Brennon must be the one listening.
[1:44:53] <BlacSoul> BIG COWARDING
[1:44:55] <%bugz_munny> And thats racist
[1:44:58] <Fear_Ranjer> OCH
[1:44:59] <%huskarl_zap> dawn of war blood
[1:45:02] <+Grayhammatter> exploded
[1:45:02] <%Frost_Quill> Cut.
[1:45:05] <%MelBrooksKA> But is he the King of Sit?
[1:45:06] <+krabsan> @silverira it has literally nothing in common with schindlers list man
[1:45:11] <%Frost_Quill> The guy on the ground was cut in some way.
[1:45:16] <+brightman42> there is no stabbed
[1:45:17] <%cureneckbeard> kick bishop brennan up the arse
[1:45:24] <%Commiekin> the distinction is very important, knives and swords
[1:45:24] <%toastybites> maybe he was eaten LUL
[1:45:27] <%huskarl_zap> shankes
[1:45:28] <+Mijymish> there was a weapon on the floor
[1:45:28] <%SuckerPunchSyd> there is a bit of leway
[1:45:30] <Radski5> Humans have alot more blood in them than we give them credit for.
[1:45:31] <Man_in_the_Red> there should be a bled out option
[1:45:32] <%arancet> @PatStaresAt sometimes itll accept multiple answers
[1:45:37] <%joylent_blue> paige's hiccups always freak me out at first LUL
[1:45:37] <dirigibledplomo> If the faces are not blurry, that means you already have all the information to identify someone
[1:45:39] <%aishman> Who is NOT Blurry anymore
[1:45:39] <%Klonoa__> a clear picture! hmmm
[1:45:40] <+MrAristocrates> wait until you have to learn the difference between "speared" and "spiked"
[1:45:42] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> dem paige burps
[1:45:42] <Saltmeisterr> does the first mate have a son?
[1:45:44] <%bugz_munny> Remember the names!
[1:45:44] <CuttleCrow> what kind of insurance company cares about if you it was a knife or a sword LUL
[1:45:45] <seainspace> brenann?
[1:45:47] <%bugz_munny> The names!
[1:45:49] <Andrizzleton> they're pretty generous with the methods
[1:45:50] <+stealthyProboscis> You might get more clues about some deaths from scenes other than the one where they actually died
[1:45:53] <Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> Bottom right is brenann?
[1:45:59] <%TheBitingIrish> mmissed
[1:46:01] <+brightman42> they said a name
[1:46:04] <AThing_> You skipped the surgeon
[1:46:05] <BlacSoul> TIM
[1:46:08] <AThing_> Higher ranks at top
[1:46:10] <%TheBitingIrish> nah
[1:46:13] <%Joustar_> This ship didn't have Kraken insurance
[1:46:14] <%bugz_munny> not right
[1:46:14] <%espanishcanamurciana> Now this is podracing
[1:46:14] <%Faustgesicht> Good jo
[1:46:16] <+Freelance7> Guys quiet
[1:46:16] <+Mijymish> @dirigibledplomo Yeah, but "have all" might be after making some difficult assumptions
[1:46:18] <amask777> this guy is everywhere
[1:46:18] <%bugz_munny> oh wit
[1:46:19] <AThing_> woops
[1:46:20] <Radski5> Speared implies the spear stayed in while spiked implies it was removed, no?
[1:46:24] <%TheBitingIrish> Oh hey, I have sub?
[1:46:24] <$Bane_Kaikyo> Bane_Kaikyo subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 20 months!

[1:46:41] <%MidnightBurst12> Disregard

[1:46:49] <delerim001> just let it like that for now
[1:46:49] <%bread_assassin> This is definitely a sub mode only kinda stream.
[1:46:50] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> The game will tell you if you're right later, you'll be fine
[1:46:50] <%Sendrak70> Any chance of us getting more world of horror in the nearish future?
[1:46:50] <+Merhabi> fix it in post
[1:46:50] <spacecatstreams> let pat be wrong. it's okay if he's wrong. the game will tell him eventually.
[1:46:51] <+Mijymish> @Radski5 I think spiked implies a spike (of a beast)
[1:46:51] <%aishman> Nothing to be sorry about Paige
[1:46:51] <%spiritofmojave> Ignore chat harder tho

[1:50:32] <%huskarl_zap> how is keel hauled not a death option?
[1:50:32] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> It sounded like Hobbit to me.
[1:50:32] <%ringabal> That accent was Yuri Lowenthal
[1:50:32] <+Mijymish> You can go back later
[1:50:34] <%Czar_Kazem> fuck that's big and real
[1:50:34] <+stealthyProboscis> @wellshuckit You have to have three deaths completely correct to get them confirmed
[1:50:35] <%BubbaRands> DAMN

[1:50:49] <%CommanderSqueaks> Natural causes.
[1:50:49] <Solidnick18> blasted his brains out
[1:50:52] <TheTunnelSn8ke> Flintlocks are brutal.
[1:50:56] <+Mijymish> I only knew this accent by imagining how my parents would say that line.

[1:51:06] <amask777> go upstairs
[1:51:07] <Radski5> He was just trying to help him summon his persona.
[1:51:09] <%schlager087> is snitching an option for how someone was killed?
[1:51:10] <%Czar_Kazem> this reminds of the pictures we saw in a forensic investigation class i took in college. that was gnarly
[1:51:11] <%Reanimator83> His face is fucking gone LUL
[1:51:14] <+Taglog7> BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump
[1:51:15] <+A_mere_shrubb> what if the shooter and the stabbed are the same person?
[1:51:17] <%espanishcanamurciana> Imagine this game mode in bloodborne doing crime scene work in Yharnam
[1:51:19] <%ZE_Count> You can hear the voices in the book
[1:51:19] <%CursedNobleman> "Poisoned by his enemies!"
[1:51:20] <Fear_Ranjer> So was he stabbed in the process of the mutiny?
[1:51:24] <delerim001> now you can
[1:51:24] <%SaiyanShoto> Magic cock? What?
[1:51:25] <stardustcrusad3r> pat real name PATRICK?

[1:51:30] <+Grayhammatter> look at his face
[1:51:31] <%SuckerPunchSyd> its fine
[1:51:32] <PROUD2beGINGER> The power of Pat's magic cock
[1:51:32] <%Frost_Quill> Using the Epstein case as a guide this was clearly a suicide.
[1:51:34] <%BinaryFireball> He is the only guy with no face?
[1:51:34] <%cureneckbeard> clockpatrick
[1:51:34] <%TheBitingIrish> His snazzy hat
[1:51:35] <silverira> USE THE CLOCK STAND
[1:51:37] <+wellshuckit> His hat.
[1:51:38] <+stealthyProboscis> @espanishcanamurciana I don't think they bother with that in Yharnam
[1:51:40] <amask777> a hand cannon

[1:51:44] <+Solutha> his cool hat
[1:51:44] <+Iamdenril> "he was stabbed in the back 37 times.... worse case of suicide ive ever seen"
[1:51:46] <%SuckerPunchSyd> some guy
[1:51:49] <gryffinp> "This unknown soul met an unknown fate" is such a choice line of text to see a hundred times
[1:51:49] <%Dfreddy8> ZA WARUDO
[1:51:50] <%Frost_Quill> The guy Brennan shot.
[1:51:51] <%Nupinoop296> you'll figure it out

[1:51:58] <cipher758> that guy ain't using a hat no more I tell u what
[1:51:59] <+Mijymish> try mainland europe
[1:52:00] <BinaryBetrayer> I like how the methods of death available are the first warning that things went to all kinds of shit.
[1:52:00] <%dashmatt> Passenger penis manifest
[1:52:01] <%walternatorz> looked like a suicide to me, the guy was trying to stop him
[1:52:01] <%Mister_McDerp> It sounded human
[1:52:02] <serrule1> Clearly these sailors broke into this Kraken's boat and sprinkled blood everywhere!
[1:52:02] <%Parapattern> @espanishcanamurciana 90% of those cases would be "cause of death: torn apart by werewolf."
[1:52:03] <Robot_Nixon_> human accents
[1:52:03] <%Klonoa__> you can listen again if you go back to the memory
[1:52:07] <Wight_Trash> He called the guy fresh

[1:55:43] <BinaryBetrayer> There's no chill at sea
[1:55:46] <+brightman42> the fart gas can be a bit dramatic
[1:55:48] <%AncelDeLambert> tell us the lesson that we should learn
[1:55:49] <ExpressNode> Hey chat dumb question but I hope someone might answer. Got a new gpu and it idles at 46 Celcius without fans turning on. Is that a feature of new GPUs unless they hit 60 Celcius (that I've read and looked at in some forums)?
[1:55:51] <%OhioNitsud> DEATHWATCH
[1:55:52] <%CommanderSqueaks> I feel like some people might have made a few oopsies during this trip
[1:55:52] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> that glow in the distance is super ominous now
[1:56:00] <+Mijymish> The captain has the most dramatic, wonderful voice.
[1:56:00] <%bugz_munny> There are many Plague of Gripes on this boat
[1:56:00] <%AncelDeLambert> @PatStaresAt that ghost gas is actually a loading screen. Isn't that neat?

[1:59:17] <+withguac> Why does Paige sound like the devious imp in a children‚Äôs movie that wants the main characters‚Äôs magical item?
[1:59:25] <+mczarklesby> Don't try to outrace your ghost. It gets lonely.
[1:59:26] <%huskarl_zap> one armed bandit hes called
[1:59:27] <+brightman42> you can't beat it there, you have to follow it, it's dumb
[1:59:30] <BinaryBetrayer> We're getting close to the moment when stuff gets crazy.
[1:59:30] <%walternatorz> I wonder what a speed run looks like in this game...
[1:59:36] <%ringabal> Time ghost wants to be your friend
[1:59:37] <librettodude> follow the white goo ghost?
[1:59:38] <+Flambage> @PeachSaliva Can you help Pat solve this puzzle through the power of music?
[1:59:38] <%Commiekin> go find your fart ghost
[1:59:38] <tonfirean> Let the ghost lead you
[1:59:40] <+brightman42> look at the magic
[1:59:41] <%Mister_McDerp> LUL
[1:59:42] <gryffinp> The magic smoke is a very pissy baby smoke and sometimes really gets mad if you try to skip it's flight path
[1:59:44] <%Piemono> Just follow the stink
[1:59:45] <%MayorRev> why didnt you follow it :(
[1:59:46] <%CommanderSqueaks> LUL
[1:59:47] <%UvBenServed> Gotta escort fart gas
[1:59:48] <%spiritofmojave> @withguac I live for how specific this is LUL
[1:59:49] <noahjpvd> Follow the ghost
[1:59:49] <+Loinclothiclese> @withguac they got the inspiration from somewhere LUL
[1:59:50] <%dashmatt> you gotta follow it
[1:59:52] <%joylent_blue> Jebaited
[1:59:53] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat hates fart gas.
[1:59:53] <tranquilturnip> it got annoyed LUL
[1:59:54] <Radski5> Hardly neede the Kraken with how many people just merc'd each other.
[1:59:55] <ShiningAxis> You have to be near the trail or it will not progress
[1:59:57] <delerim001> IT IS SLOW AS FUCK
[2:00:00] <+krabsan> you gotta look at the trail tho
[2:00:02] <%KoiRedd> Whirly thing go swoosh
[2:00:03] <+Mijymish> would a speed run just be memorizing them all?
[2:00:03] <%Commiekin> it needs to be seen, okay
[2:00:04] <wruce__billis> @walternatorz It looks look filling in the entire book by nuscle memory before the game even really begins
[2:00:04] <%ZE_Count> FOLLOW MAGIC PAT!
[2:00:04] <+mczarklesby> Fart ghosts love the big reveal. They HATE when you skip the lead in.
[2:00:06] <%huskarl_zap> 1OMEN AND ORENTIALS?
[2:00:07] <tranquilturnip> Dramatic Timing ghost moves at its own pace
[2:00:08] <+brightman42> if you look away it stops so you don't lose it I think
[2:00:08] <%Commiekin> it's an exhibitionist
[2:00:09] <%ringabal> No time for ghosts! Only insurance
[2:00:10] <%Parapattern> It takes its sweet as time
[2:00:10] <narusao> his once bright future as a juggler cut short
[2:00:16] <%MidnightBurst12> magic runs for no man
[2:00:18] <%Dfreddy8> The trail is ALWAYS where you went
[2:00:19] <%spiritofmojave> tf is that accent

[2:01:27] <%walternatorz> he's a gunner
[2:01:32] <%huskarl_zap> >Pickofscwartsaneggergivingromansalite.jpg
[2:01:33] <+Mijymish> the gunner does not have a frenchman tho

[2:01:41] <%encrouched> 2 OF EVERY TYPE
[2:01:44] <%arancet> but only 1 frenchman
[2:01:45] <%dukenux> its not russian
[2:01:45] <+Shubreaker> HE'S DEF NOT RUSSIAN
[2:01:46] <gryffinp> Paige has a good point about following on the multiple austrian possibility
[2:01:46] <%Frost_Quill> Just one frenchman.
[2:01:47] <TheFramedWarlock> VERDAMMT

[2:01:55] <deafmutelaughing> "my frenchman" is the key line here
[2:01:55] <%Frost_Quill> So he's probably Alfred then.
[2:01:55] <%spiritofmojave> Not Russian I don't think
[2:01:57] <%Dfreddy8> "Remember, no Russian"

[2:03:35] <%Mister_McDerp> french torn apart yes
[2:03:36] <%SaiyanShoto> Paige is the best LUL LUL
[2:03:37] <+Ancopro> frenchman was tron apart
[2:03:38] <%king_wragles> SPECIFICALLY, he was torn in half I think
[2:03:39] <BinaryBetrayer> It's a safe bet that the Squid also too his arm
[2:03:42] <+Mijymish> he said squid about his own arm toooooo
[2:03:43] <+Shubreaker> they could be lying
[2:03:44] <cipher758> big nutz
[2:03:52] <%spiritofmojave> That Frenchman got ripped and teared
[2:03:54] <%Frost_Quill> "Took" him could mean just killing or literally taking him off the ship.
[2:03:56] <%huskarl_zap> GOTT SCHITZ UND DE KONGREICH
[2:03:59] <gryffinp> Not sure if that narrows it down much because it seems like the squiddo racked up a pretty big body count
[2:04:00] <%encrouched> The Calamari Killer
[2:04:02] <bluebiscuit94> See what's up topside
[2:04:03] <+Mijymish> frenchy killed offscreen
[2:04:11] <%Czar_Kazem> the music fits your narration so well
[2:04:12] <+brightman42> if you check the map you can see that William is comi
[2:04:15] <+WarDogOnTheBeat> yo fuck this boat

[2:04:21] <+brightman42> nvm
[2:04:21] <%CommanderSqueaks> WOTS ALL DIS DEN
[2:04:21] <%encrouched> Are you 007 wtf

[2:04:27] <+FatherGreyBeard> This boat fucking sucked
[2:04:28] <Party_de_Dos> cheeky buggers
[2:04:28] <librettodude> @goatbait only on the first viewing
[2:04:30] <%bugz_munny> Theres a time limit on the first view
[2:04:31] <%ChaosAethr> It got hit by the Kraken!!!!!!!!!!

[2:04:32] <%aishman> Expired
[2:04:32] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Paige is helping, I just witnessed her brain turn back the record too many seconds, and forget something she figured out herself.
[2:04:35] <%CommanderSqueaks> BOATS ARE TERRIBLE
[2:04:35] <%goatbait> :0
[2:04:35] <+Mijymish> read the transcript pat
[2:04:37] <tranquilturnip> Boats are like proto-spaceships
[2:04:39] <Karhax> sure
[2:04:40] <%ZE_Count> READ evrything
[2:04:40] <+radda343> radda343 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 27 months! 
[2:04:41] <+brightman42> either
[2:04:41] <Kojixif> expired
[2:04:42] <%PhantomMiG> Wait that guy was coming out of his room
[2:04:42] <%miguelrod777> exploded lol
[2:04:42] <seainspace> expired
[2:04:42] <bluebiscuit94> EXPIRED
[2:04:42] <TheFramedWarlock> @goatbait There is the first time you see them, but you can go back any time
[2:04:44] <%spiritofmojave> Boats AND cruises SUCK
[2:04:44] <%dukenux> EXPIRED?
[2:04:46] <%marsantas> Don't worry about doing them all right away
[2:04:47] <Wallrod> to be fair the boat managed to sail back on its own, it's probably pretty good
[2:04:47] <BinaryBetrayer> I wonder if the Squid took his arm too.
[2:04:48] <%huskarl_zap> GOTT REITZ EN DE KONGREICH
[2:04:49] <%Onmi_Khaos> The Kraken tore his arm off
[2:04:50] <+Edrem> multiple different death types count sometimes
[2:04:50] <%CommanderSqueaks> Coming from a person whose uncle was a harbormaster, BOATS SUCK
[2:04:52] <+brightman42> X is dead guy
[2:04:52] <%GingerStrawhat> I would think it would
[2:04:52] <gryffinp> oh god he left it on expired
[2:04:54] <%ringabal> The arm sped up the process
[2:04:54] <%spiritofmojave> why would you ever go on a cruise
[2:04:56] <deafmutelaughing> "a lot going on" oh honey you haven't even seen the half of it
[2:04:58] <%dukenux> like yoghurt?
[2:05:04] <%Frost_Quill> So we know who that is.
[2:05:05] <%Commiekin> You can bookmark a character to highlight other memories they showed up in. This can help with ambiguous deaths.
[2:05:07] <%ZE_Count> this game so good
[2:05:07] <%WackyGear> @PatStaresAt is bled out an option?
[2:05:10] <juliberna> man i remember playing this game, it's so good
[2:05:10] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Did you see him before?
[2:05:10] <%A0N33> "Electrocuted" is an option, I don't think it'll be used LUL
[2:05:11] <kazadaz> Sometimes there are multiple acceptable answers for cause of death.
[2:05:13] <%encrouched> Left the Blood letting machine on accidentally
[2:05:13] <%Klonoa__> maybe add that in the manifest?
[2:05:19] <+Mijymish> You can also look at their clothes and think about stereotypes.
[2:05:19] <%ringabal> Multiple ways to bleed out
[2:05:20] <%joylent_blue> the captain seems like he did some shit
[2:05:21] <bluebiscuit94> Maybe Alfred was torn apart as well? he's missing an arm after all
[2:05:25] <Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> The torn apart guy the same person with the tattoos?
[2:05:26] <%GingerStrawhat> So the frenchman is possibly the guy with the Tattoos?
[2:05:30] <+Double_negative> Torso up top is probably the frenchman
[2:05:32] <%PhantomMiG> @patstaresat One of the guys came out of his room and some of the rooms are rooms for certain rooms
[2:05:35] <%CommanderSqueaks> Is this what it meant to be an Insurance Adjuster back in the 1800's?
[2:05:37] <%benjiFG> this is like that one song with miku
[2:05:38] <+Mijymish> @GingerStrawhat Nope
[2:05:38] <%CommanderSqueaks> What the fuck!?
[2:05:39] <+FatherGreyBeard> Alive is probably the most fucked up fate of all
[2:05:39] <%Frost_Quill> Unknown might be a legit thing if you can't figure it out.
[2:05:42] <+brightman42> kinda has to be that
[2:05:42] <%MelBrooksKA> @A0N33 They could be struck by lightning
[2:05:46] <%Faustgesicht> his arms missing
[2:05:46] <%Nupinoop296> well his arm did get ripped off
[2:05:47] <%aishman> @GingerStrawhat Those tattooes are curely [REDACTED]
[2:05:47] <%CommanderSqueaks> Peach, don't worry about that
[2:05:47] <+DaoistSensei> just move on
[2:05:47] <@SoFarFetched> torn apart seems the closest
[2:05:47] <Robot_Nixon_> he died on account of his arm being ripped off
[2:05:48] <%KoiRedd> Is "Tickled" on there?
[2:05:51] <%GingerStrawhat> Torn apart sounds the most appropriate
[2:05:51] <+rascalrebel> literally said he was torn apart
[2:05:52] <%aishman> Torn apart dude
[2:05:54] <%TheBitingIrish> His arm's off!
[2:05:54] <%Mister_McDerp> torn apart technically right?
[2:06:00] <+brightman42> torn apart is the only one that works tho
[2:06:02] <%goatbait> damn, this is a lot I can't keep up
[2:06:02] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Look at other memories?
[2:06:04] <%encrouched> Is Murked by Dagon an option?
[2:06:04] <%CommanderSqueaks> Is mutilated an option?;
[2:06:06] <%SuckerPunchSyd> i mean his arm is gone
[2:06:06] <+Mijymish> torn... ap-arm
[2:06:06] <%whiskey_wolfe_> The only Irishman is a butcher called EMIL. WHAT IS THIS
[2:06:06] <%bugz_munny> technically torn apart?
[2:06:07] <%Forente> he feels torn apart
[2:06:07] <%dukenux> he lost an arm?
[2:06:09] <%ringabal> "This unknown soul was spiked with the sickest dunk."
[2:06:09] <%cureneckbeard> HE DIED SOMEHOW
[2:06:13] <Firesparks> how long have the game been going on?
[2:06:13] <%Frost_Quill> We know the name of the guy who got torn apart by the kraken now too.
[2:06:17] <%spiritofmojave> HE DIED IDK MAN
[2:06:18] <+brightman42> check map
[2:06:18] <%CommanderSqueaks> N A T U R A L C A U S E S
[2:06:19] <%Onmi_Khaos> I mean it's clear WHY he died, his arm was forcebly removed from his body
[2:06:19] <%spiritofmojave> LUL
[2:06:22] <%MidnightBurst12> who could say how he died
[2:06:23] <%dukenux> doesnt that count as torn?
[2:06:25] <+Mijymish> @Frost_Quill now
[2:06:27] <%spiritofmojave> that's his official cause of death
[2:06:29] <+Mijymish> no
[2:06:29] <Firesparks> !hour
[2:06:30] <+burgerdicks> is "disarmed" a cause of death option?
[2:06:30] <%miguelrod777> shots popping off as he's waking up
[2:06:32] <%ZE_Count> Oh shit
[2:06:32] <%toastybites> multiple people could have been torn apart by the kraken guys
[2:06:34] <+Mijymish> multiple people got torn apart

[2:06:44] <%Dfreddy8> smh
[2:06:48] <+brightman42> this page is really handy
[2:06:48] <brachydios777> This games manages to tell a great story with barely any animation while TLOU 2 shits it‚Äôs narrative‚Äôs bed with its triple A budget
[2:06:48] <Man_in_the_Red> a literal time line, yes

[2:07:02] <%honeyman18> This game design is amazing.

[2:07:24] <+Mijymish> @Frost_Quill sorry, typing exuberance. No, frenchy is not the tattooman
[2:07:27] <%CommanderSqueaks> PAT BIG BRAIN
[2:07:32] <librettodude> The idea of solving the deaths of 60 people in a shared fate is just inherently compelling
[2:07:34] <%CommanderSqueaks> Peach also big brain
[2:07:38] <%Frost_Quill> @Mijymish Oh, that's interesting.
[2:07:42] <SaltyAzteca> LUL
[2:07:43] <%ZE_Count> that voice pat
[2:07:45] <%dukenux> Genius Columbo
[2:07:47] <%CommanderSqueaks> @librettodude And you're not even a fucking detective, you are an INSURANCE adjuster.
[2:07:53] <%spiritofmojave> TLOU2 needed a small country worked to death, this needed probably a small city at best of peeps given direction/proper time id assume
[2:07:56] <+brightman42> next one
[2:07:57] <+Mijymish> @Frost_Quill Kraken has so many tentacles, it can pull apart many people
[2:08:05] <%bread_assassin> So if those two were co-conspirators, why did one shoot the other?

[2:09:11] <%Joustar_> chaaAATTTT

[2:09:14] <@SoFarFetched> Also pat just said midships room LUL
[2:09:19] <tranquilturnip> its intentionally a little clunky
[2:09:19] <+Loinclothiclese> fucking idiots

[2:18:29] <%bread_assassin> TBF, Pat did label the other guys as Lars first.
[2:18:30] <lesserkarl> victim is the dane and murderer has the brother
[2:18:31] <+Mijymish> lol, the pooping transcript has no words
[2:18:31] <%Frost_Quill> Paige started this stream super on top of everything and now this.
[2:18:32] <%Onmi_Khaos> Yeah, the one who said "Let me on" and got told "Over my dead body you bloody Dane"

[2:18:46] <%Radski5> But Baba is...but Baba...
[2:18:48] <+brightman42> Peter Parker, murderer
[2:18:48] <%spiritofmojave> It's an understandable thing
[2:18:53] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Engwithan_Elder_God Absolutely not
[2:18:56] <BinaryBetrayer> But Lars ceases to be
[2:18:57] <%Chatterbox1991> @PatStaresAt only black dude on the crew manifest
[2:18:58] <%SomeSageAdvice> he named two people Danish
[2:19:01] <noahjpvd> He did I think
[2:19:03] <%Mister_McDerp> but who was brother?
[2:19:03] <+Loinclothiclese> @PatStaresAt there was a guy from sierra leone towards the bottom of the book
[2:19:08] <%huskarl_zap> That guy was all like POGGERS PogChamp
[2:19:08] <%CommanderSqueaks> But who was phone?
[2:19:13] <%king_wragles> I think I saw it
[2:19:14] <%Onmi_Khaos> A brother who died in the ropes
[2:19:17] <lloyddboy> OMID
[2:19:17] <%AncelDeLambert> There's three black men on this ship
[2:19:18] <%dukenux> cant you sort names alphabeticallt
[2:19:22] <%TheFabledAble> the brother died beforehand so he might not be listed in the manifest
[2:19:32] <%Radski5> This is an ex-Lars.
[2:19:32] <%Mister_McDerp> peters I saw twice
[2:19:34] <+Mijymish> in the ropes and earlier, so not yet seen his death/corpse
[2:19:34] <SirDogBear> the memories bookmarks help in these situations
[2:19:35] <%huskarl_zap> Topman as opposed to Bottom men
[2:19:36] <+brightman42> two Peters
[2:19:38] <zedravan> 48 60
[2:19:42] <noahjpvd> Peters
[2:19:42] <%ringabal> That's what insurance men DO, Pat
[2:19:42] <%CommanderSqueaks> "enemy'?!
[2:19:46] <%AncelDeLambert> @PatStaresAt Pat, if he has a brother, and that guy killed his brother, then both brothers are on the list. So who's the killer?
[2:19:48] <CandideCamera> you wouldn't know which brother anyway, gotta wait for later
[2:19:54] <%Piemen99> enemy?
[2:19:55] <%huskarl_zap> Power Top men vs Power Bottom men
[2:19:55] <%CommanderSqueaks> @ringabal This is what they do!?
[2:19:57] <Karhax> who knows
[2:19:57] <%encrouched> Double Pete
[2:19:58] <%ZE_Count> Wait for later

[2:20:00] <%Faustgesicht> 50/50 shot
[2:20:01] <+Mijymish> just pick a name. who's a killer, sam or nate
[2:20:02] <%walternatorz> start with one
[2:20:02] <%king_wragles> It narrows it down at least
[2:20:07] <%Parapattern> Pete and Pete
[2:20:09] <%bugz_munny> better find that brother
[2:20:09] <+DaoistSensei> just pick one lol

[2:25:35] <%Undenizen> I forgot i had this tab open. Where's Pat?
[2:25:40] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pee
[2:25:44] <%PettyFunk> @CommanderSqueaks You gonna stand there and pretend you can't hear the toilet crying out in pain?
[2:25:46] <%Psych_man13_13> Drinking his pee
[2:25:49] <gryffinp> Pat's on a boat
[2:25:50] <%PettyFunk> I KNOW YOU CAN
[2:25:51] <%ringabal> Whenever Pat's not on screen...
[2:25:55] <%CommanderSqueaks> @PettyFunk I KNOW YOU CAN
[2:25:56] <%KoiRedd> He's "self-pissing"
[2:25:58] <+trekkie11041> LOUD PEE
[2:26:12] <%KoiRedd> Do with that phrase what you will
[2:26:13] <%Klonoa__> JermaMustard
[2:26:14] <%Undenizen> @ringabal that's not true. sometimes he has to help Paige's butt.
[2:26:18] <%Psych_man13_13> Glass cutting pee
[2:26:20] <+DinnerCalzone> pat's brb music kinda slaps
[2:26:29] <%cureneckbeard> toothpeest
[2:26:33] <%CommanderSqueaks> I just imagine Pat talking like Barret to himself while peeing and I can't stop laughing now
[2:26:52] <%PettyFunk> @CommanderSqueaks Naked, with the TP roll on his arm like a machine gun
[2:27:04] <%CommanderSqueaks> I'm ascending, fuck LUL
[2:27:16] <%KoiRedd> Pat is a naked shitter, remember that..
[2:27:22] <@StridentSong> Barrett doing the Jerry Stiller talk to himself in the bathroom in Zoolander
[2:27:29] <%WhereIsWill> just got here sup fans of the ORB
[2:27:35] <%Undenizen> Did you guys see Tony Hawk actually responded to the animated existential nightmare short?
[2:27:37] <+sixcubit> @KoiRedd truly, we have much to learn from him
[2:27:38] <%CommanderSqueaks> I just believe Pat is naked whenever he's not on camera.
[2:27:44] <+ShinBojangles> Does pat have large rolls of TP or small arms?
[2:27:47] <@StridentSong> "Come on na, gimme a little pee pee"
[2:27:48] <%cvp5127> tony hawk sempai noticed us
[2:27:49] <%benjiFG> nice cut back
[2:27:51] <%joylent_blue> Paige, outside the bathroom, softly going "Get help"
[2:27:52] <%CommanderSqueaks> @ShinBojangles Yes
[2:27:55] <%WhereIsWill> its TRUE
[2:27:56] <%miguelrod777> LUL
[2:28:00] <SummonerMagno> Alf is back
[2:28:00] <%CommanderSqueaks> XD
[2:28:02] <%CommanderSqueaks> LUL
[2:28:08] <%Parapattern> Pat is naked whenever you are not looking directly at him
[2:28:08] <+Mijymish> don't forget to label nate!!
[2:28:10] <Kojixif> dont forget to mark nathan
[2:28:10] <%spiritofmojave> LUL
[2:28:11] <%Psych_man13_13> How was your pee
[2:28:11] <%ringabal> Blunt force trauma is no joke
[2:28:12] <%KoiRedd> I have nothing more to learn from him @sixcubit
[2:28:14] <BinaryBetrayer> Sailors are burly
[2:28:14] <%CommanderSqueaks> I forgot Peach was watching the chat the entire time.
[2:28:19] <%PettyFunk> He could be naked right now, with convincing bodypaint
[2:28:21] <BinaryBetrayer> And barely human
[2:28:23] <%goatbait> BFT man
[2:28:23] <%Mr_Pylon> You've got Nathan and the other guy for sure
[2:28:24] <tonfirean> You should mark the killer's portrait as Nathan Peters too, I don't think you did that. @PatStaresAt
[2:28:28] <gryffinp> that book probably doesn't matter
[2:28:37] <%ringabal> Mans really walking around with Grimoire Weiss
[2:28:38] <Superfly_Magpie> a curse book?
[2:28:46] <%Mr_Pylon> And Brennan
[2:28:46] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> paiges been hit with pats big club if ya know what i mean ;)
[2:28:46] <%CommanderSqueaks> .. Wait, doesn't this take place in the 1800's? Couldn't a lot of people read by then?
[2:28:47] <BinaryBetrayer> Mark his brother for death by accident too
[2:28:50] <+ShinBojangles> Your a wizard Harry!
[2:28:52] <%PettyFunk> Pat, that guy he's leaning in and whispering to is probably his brother!
[2:28:55] <+ShinBojangles> fug
[2:28:58] <%benjiFG> haha milk
[2:29:00] <+ShinBojangles> You're
[2:29:03] <%walternatorz> printing press?
[2:29:12] <%aishman> HOly shiy that's a lot of dead people
[2:29:12] <%walternatorz> bible
[2:29:14] <%CommanderSqueaks> TOMES
[2:29:16] <%GoCoSpace> GoCoSpace subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 11 months! henlo
[2:29:18] <%doc_ock_rokc> Thats a professonal 200 pound sailor with a thick as club
[2:29:21] <BinaryBetrayer> Wipeouts
[2:29:23] <TheTunnelSn8ke> They probably had rudimentary grasps at best.
[2:29:25] <Andrizzleton> literally only in the last 100 years
[2:29:27] <+Mijymish> there are some people on a boat. and there are other people NOT on the boat
[2:29:28] <gryffinp> Well, this is a ship of the crown rather than a pirate ship, so probably the officers were literate, most of them anyway
[2:29:28] <%CommanderSqueaks> I'm calling it in my head who that nerd is.
[2:29:29] <%marsantas> It depends on the country, mostly post 1800's
[2:29:29] <%KoiRedd> Very good deduction, Paige
[2:29:31] <%Undenizen> Yeah by 1800s most people could ready, they just maybe didn't own any books.
[2:29:32] <+brightman42> what's he doing?
[2:29:34] <%Monkeyweed21> The early 20th century when public education became standard
[2:29:38] <@StridentSong> You do, but 2 triangles
[2:29:40] <delerim001> people of the same status are together in the picture
[2:29:41] <%Idziman> like a couple years ago
[2:29:42] <%Mendin> They might be able to read the bible a little bit but literacy is mostly for the officers for paperwork purposes
[2:29:42] <+Mijymish> it's his occupation and portrait
[2:29:42] <%Mr_Pylon> They were in other visions
[2:29:43] <%Parapattern> That guy took me forever
[2:29:45] <Solidnick18> elmo
[2:29:46] <%CommanderSqueaks> 2 triangles.
[2:29:48] <@StridentSong> Means you'd have to investigate scenes he's in
[2:29:51] <+brightman42> he's unblurred from the get go
[2:29:51] <tranquilturnip> There's a clue right there
[2:29:52] <CandideCamera> You know they disappeared during The Doom, you just don't have corpses
[2:29:52] <%MidnightBurst12> look at what he's doing
[2:29:54] <amask777> Check the First Mate's door (the open one in the back)
[2:29:58] <%aishman> @PatStaresAt Remember you can see all the memories a person shows up in the book
[2:30:00] <deafmutelaughing> just because it's unblurred doesn't mean you can REALLY figure it out until after you've seen everything
[2:30:01] <Corvax__> you can look at the last memory he appeared in
[2:30:05] <+Mijymish> definitely make assumptions based on clothes
[2:30:07] <kazadaz> I just looked it up, like 70% literacy in Britain in 1850
[2:30:10] <%marsantas> The crew get increasingly difficult to match
[2:30:17] <beautyfulman> @PatStaresAt Theres an important distinction, the blurring is when you have all the info the game will GIVE you
[2:30:22] <%marsantas> You have to PAY ATTENTION TO THE ENVIROMENT
[2:30:22] <%Dfreddy8> There's 2 Fat smelly bellies here
[2:30:23] <+Mijymish> FLIES
[2:30:23] <lloyddboy> LEG
[2:30:24] <TheTunnelSn8ke> Flies outside.
[2:30:25] <gryffinp> I mean, a photo wouldn't be meaningfully different than the portraits, unless the photo was helpfully labeled
[2:30:25] <+mczarklesby> Haha!
[2:30:28] <tonfirean> iirc it's a bit vague on when it unblurs, like, maybe you have enough to make a good educated guess but sometimes you can get more evidence later.
[2:30:28] <beautyfulman> @PatStaresAt It may not be enough to make it immediately obvious
[2:30:29] <%UvBenServed> FEET
[2:30:32] <%GingerStrawhat> Is that the goat?
[2:30:33] <terminusterminal> AH MY LEG
[2:30:33] <BinaryBetrayer> Show feet
[2:30:35] <bluebiscuit94> HANGED MAN
[2:30:36] <%Aydarkzero> this game looks cool
[2:30:36] <TheTunnelSn8ke> That's a femur.
[2:30:38] <%cvp5127> nani

[2:30:47] <%GingerStrawhat> Oh no I know what that is
[2:30:51] <+Mijymish> Formosans!

[2:31:05] <tranquilturnip> sad music Pepehands
[2:31:05] <+mczarklesby> Things get real now!
[2:31:07] <lloyddboy> MENACING
[2:31:09] <@StridentSong> @PatStaresAt You can select a person to "bookmark" in your book. Then you can use the bookmark at the top of the book to see every memory they appear in
[2:31:11] <%Undenizen> that's the guy who got executed! in the picture!
[2:31:14] <TheTunnelSn8ke> Hostage situation!
[2:31:14] <%spiritofmojave> That probably was a Taiwanese man/woman watching
[2:31:18] <+Ancopro> was that the brother in the ropes
[2:31:20] <Solidnick18> damn
[2:31:20] <%ZE_Count> tats
[2:31:22] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt Fun fact - historians actually think there was literacy was more common then the previous assumption.. but books were fucking expesnive
[2:31:25] <%GingerStrawhat> He's got a tattoo
[2:31:30] <%Nupinoop296> take another look at the shot dude
[2:31:34] <%spiritofmojave> oh wait I shouldn't of said that ZZT
[2:31:36] <%GingerStrawhat> That one guy has a lady tattoo
[2:31:36] <cipher758> the party never ends over here
[2:31:46] <deafmutelaughing> a ladytree
[2:31:49] <+waltzqueen> tree lady
[2:31:50] <%KoiRedd> Dude, some shit went down on this here boat
[2:31:53] <TheTunnelSn8ke> Pin-up tattoo on his right forearm
[2:32:01] <terminusterminal> TAIWAN NUMBER 1
[2:32:03] <TheTunnelSn8ke> Correct.
[2:32:07] <%Frost_Quill> I went to the bathroom when Pat did, what did I miss?
[2:32:08] <%GingerStrawhat> Real early in the books so way before any of that stuff
[2:32:08] <+Mijymish> It's on the artist's sketch
[2:32:08] <%PhantomMiG> @patstaresat In 1800 in the U.K about 40% of men were illiterate and 60% of women
[2:32:09] <%Daxalog> I love these FACTS
[2:32:09] <TheTunnelSn8ke> Formosa = Taiwan.
[2:32:11] <%Dfreddy8> it was MURDER
[2:32:11] <%CommanderSqueaks> BIG BRIAN PEACH
[2:32:14] <gryffinp> Chapter 3: MURDER
[2:32:18] <%huskarl_zap> Made in Taiwan
[2:32:21] <lloyddboy> TOES
[2:32:23] <%spiritofmojave> Actual brain 100!
[2:32:25] <%CommanderSqueaks> So wait did all of this take place BEFORE the Kraken!?
[2:32:30] <+withguac> Why does pat only say the ethnicity of the Asians and not the others? ü§î
[2:32:32] <%GingerStrawhat> So the guy who was shot only spoke the once
[2:32:33] <@StridentSong> Clearly this was the only murder in the game
[2:32:36] <+mczarklesby> Are the Formosans speaking Hokkien and the topmen speaking Cantonese?
[2:32:37] <%dukenux> PogChamp
[2:32:40] <turbofolk> Can we paiges comment on Vtubers or favorite Vtubers?
[2:32:40] <+Mijymish> You can try for her.

[2:33:12] <%Promessa_EX> what do you think of pink rushia
[2:33:15] <%Frost_Quill> Yubi yubi.

[2:33:20] <%spiritofmojave> Korone is amazing, and she's also super weird
[2:33:21] <%GingerStrawhat> Isn't that the guy from the drawing?
[2:33:21] <+Trunksmad> Hey Pat, you gonna play the open access to Gundam Maxiboost On?
[2:33:23] <%Undenizen> this is the guy from the picture
[2:33:23] <%ShichiNoBushi> I also like Coco Kiryu because she knows English as well as many vulgarities.
[2:33:24] <%huskarl_zap> Sugoi dicku patsama
[2:33:26] <%doc_ock_rokc> samuale peters

[2:33:29] <Solidnick18> it's cool
[2:33:29] <%Nupinoop296> looks cool
[2:33:31] <+brightman42> nostalgia for old games
[2:33:32] <librettodude> It's Mystical
[2:33:32] <%CommanderSqueaks> Limitations.
[2:33:34] <gryffinp> Because old-ass apple II
[2:33:34] <Saltmeisterr> cuz it looks cool
[2:33:35] <Djinnazz> GGGGG GHOSTS!
[2:33:35] <%GoCoSpace> "It appears a dog-human hybrid creature forced the crew members to remove their fingers in tribute" *Korone sweating*
[2:33:37] <TheTunnelSn8ke> Something about Lucas Pope's aesthetic.
[2:33:39] <%GingerStrawhat> Reminds me of Old PC adventure games
[2:33:39] <wruce__billis> @PatStaresAt Don't have to deal with textures
[2:33:40] <BinaryBetrayer> Looks like an old DOS game but it's 3D
[2:33:40] <+brightman42> also what paige's saying
[2:33:41] <%AncelDeLambert> I love this art style
[2:33:41] <%Klonoa__> I think it helps certain things stick out too
[2:33:42] <brachydios777> I have very conflicted feelings on v tubers
[2:33:42] <+thekerobit> nostalgia
[2:33:44] <reonome> no need to texture the modd
[2:33:45] <+brightman42> super easy
[2:33:45] <Orenjevel> It's a real striking style
[2:33:46] <librettodude> Old Tech just has an air of mystery and age about it
[2:33:48] <professorno> looks like murder scene sketches
[2:33:48] <%SinisterBroccoli> It's like book illustrations
[2:33:48] <%Promessa_EX> I like how Korone likes fat old men
[2:33:49] <%AncelDeLambert> check out this CORPSE
[2:33:50] <%CommanderSqueaks> @wruce__billis Smart
[2:33:50] <%Shubreaker> Kiryu's also from ATL so i gotta stan
[2:33:52] <reonome> models
[2:33:52] <%MidnightBurst12> mysterious
[2:33:52] <Amadeusguy> here comes the big one
[2:33:53] <%PettyFunk> Also it's incredibly striking
[2:33:55] <gryffinp> Who could it be
[2:33:57] <terminusterminal> @PeachSaliva He was trying to capture old ink drawings of the time alongside liking the DOS stuff.
[2:33:59] <+thekerobit> its meant to look like an old hypercard game
[2:33:59] <ginnypigz> lol cool
[2:34:01] <Orenjevel> It really sets the game apart from others
[2:34:06] <spacecatstreams> thats three names in one
[2:34:07] <TheTunnelSn8ke> I saw an Abaj.
[2:34:17] <%dukenux> EIC DansGame
[2:34:21] <%Frost_Quill> Oh so the captain was racist.
[2:34:22] <Slimeking_Mike> It sort of feels like the modern equivalent of old timey woodcut drawings
[2:34:23] <BinaryBetrayer> Good luck finding who shot the killing shot
[2:34:23] <%ZE_Count> mr wolff
[2:34:24] <+Mottyrob> It's good that even the subs get subs, this pocket watch truly is magical
[2:34:25] <spacecatstreams> 4 names
[2:34:25] <%Faustgesicht> Buncha names
[2:34:26] <%Allenora> It‚Äôs surreal. Like old time illustrations
[2:34:28] <+Mijymish> Use PHYSICS for the gunz
[2:34:29] <%TheBitingIrish> Oh god, is EVERYONE in this one?
[2:34:33] <gryffinp> No
[2:34:34] <+withguac> British people been hating Chinese since 1800s smh
[2:34:35] <reonome> Â∞èÂßêis just miss, thats a bullshit translation
[2:34:35] <gryffinp> Not everyone
[2:34:35] <%SvenHolgersson> THATS OVERKILL FUCK
[2:34:36] <kingra> 3 missed LUL
[2:34:37] <%dukenux> wait would EIC even be a thing at this point
[2:34:37] <Andrizzleton> we know this picture
[2:34:38] <+brightman42> only one hit
[2:34:38] <+Mijymish> which bullet hit?
[2:34:39] <%ringabal> Now that's a party
[2:34:39] <%ZE_Count> whitch bullet hit him?
[2:34:39] <%walternatorz> track the bullet to determine the actual killer
[2:34:39] <%spiritofmojave> is that necessary LUL
[2:34:40] <$Caped_Eggy> 3 missed LUL
[2:34:41] <%toastybites> Yeah but who hit him?
[2:34:42] <%ergulor> isn't this the photo?
[2:34:43] <startstoprepeat> but who got the kill
[2:34:47] <%Radski5> Pope had established this art style years ago with the teaser he released over half a decade ago.
[2:34:50] <TheTunnelSn8ke> Top hat!
[2:34:50] <%goatbait> Looks like a suicide to me
[2:34:51] <+brightman42> I think they missed cause he's swinging around
[2:34:52] <thatonepassionbentgamer> they really lifted him into the air for that? Geezus
[2:34:52] <$Caped_Eggy> What a bunch of nerds
[2:34:52] <%Undenizen> oh god you have to figure out who didn't miss.
[2:34:53] <%spiritofmojave> ENG aim Jebaited
[2:34:54] <%huskarl_zap> Why not keelhaul?
[2:34:54] <%PettyFunk> There's your other Austrian!
[2:34:56] <%BubbaRands> THAT'S A COOL SCENE
[2:34:56] <+Trunksmad> Pat, you gonna play Gundam Maxiboost On?
[2:34:56] <seainspace> hey remember that drawing
[2:34:57] <@StridentSong> This is like one of the most important scenes in the game

[2:35:04] <%CommanderSqueaks> N A T U R A L C A U S E S
[2:35:08] <wruce__billis> Bullshit. It's to not deal with textures. Texturing SUCKS
[2:35:11] <+thekerobit> itsmeant to be like old hypercard games

[2:35:18] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> 1 hit
[2:35:20] <+withguac> Sprinkle some opium on him
[2:35:20] <TheTunnelSn8ke> Who was the kill shot?
[2:35:21] <+mczarklesby> It's a firing line. Only one gun loaded.
[2:35:21] <kazadaz> nice catch
[2:35:22] <%questionablemat> no one tell him its the drawing in the book
[2:35:23] <%ZE_Count> who killed him?
[2:35:24] <gryffinp> This is one of the better tableaus in the game
[2:35:24] <+brightman42> no
[2:35:27] <%Nupinoop296> no
[2:35:28] <@SoFarFetched> Gun's weren't great back then
[2:35:28] <tranquilturnip> LUL

[2:35:30] <%Klonoa__> blind
[2:35:30] <%toastybites> WRONG
[2:35:33] <+waltzqueen> no!
[2:35:34] <a_mad_dragon> rifles were GARBAGE then
[2:35:35] <delerim001> wrong
[2:35:36] <%Faustgesicht> retrace your shots
[2:35:37] <@SoFarFetched> Think it took them awhile to make a gun that can fire correctly straight
[2:35:37] <zedravan> stumbo
[2:35:39] <+Mijymish> i'm not sure blasted by the terrible beast is right. if i remember, you gotta go back and see who lit the fuse, and the death is attributed to him
[2:35:40] <%Klonoa__> lol
[2:35:41] <@StridentSong> psaBlind
[2:35:41] <+Solutha> blind
[2:35:42] <%CommanderSqueaks> psaBlind Trajectories are hard
[2:35:43] <reonome> lol
[2:35:43] <brachydios777> How did two missed?
[2:35:44] <librettodude> psaWrong
[2:35:45] <%TheBitingIrish> Brennan
[2:35:45] <%Nupinoop296> there ya go
[2:35:47] <riiloseah> OH SHIT THIS IS THE DRAWING
[2:35:49] <BinaryBetrayer> That guy kills a lot of people
[2:35:50] <gryffinp> oh no the ink
[2:35:50] <%PettyFunk> Yep!
[2:35:50] <lloyddboy> BRENNAN
[2:35:52] <%Shubreaker> fuckin brennan
[2:35:53] <+Jaegen16> Brennan
[2:35:53] <wruce__billis> This guy is in EVERY memory
[2:35:53] <TheTunnelSn8ke> Brennan can actually AIM
[2:35:54] <%dukenux> it was the one on a grassy knoll
[2:35:55] <%Nupinoop296> @riiloseah yup
[2:35:56] <+mczarklesby> On an execution, four guns, only one loaded bullet so the team had a 'clean conscience."
[2:35:56] <+brightman42> yep
[2:35:58] <Andrizzleton> that's why you have a firing line diffusion of responsibility as well as make sure he ded
[2:35:59] <jordanstayshome> I love insurance adjuster the game
[2:36:00] <%PettyFunk> He has a lot of blood on his hands yikes
[2:36:01] <+Loinclothiclese> @brachydios777 theyre on a ship
[2:36:02] <%Faustgesicht> Brennan's killstreak continues
[2:36:02] <%ZE_Count> Thats soo cool you get walk in the drawing
[2:36:04] <%ringabal> Hmmmmm
[2:36:05] <%huskarl_zap> maybe
[2:36:06] <%Forente> aslo shitty guns
[2:36:07] <reonome> I WONDER
[2:36:08] <%Promessa_EX> firing lines like that remove guilt from the individual
[2:36:12] <%ringabal> BUT IS HE
[2:36:14] <Orenjevel> They're also blind
[2:36:16] <brachydios777> @loinclothiclese Yeah that‚Äôs true
[2:36:17] <+Mijymish> you can also label her as miss lim!
[2:36:20] <%CommanderSqueaks> I T W A S N A T U R A L CAUSES
[2:36:20] <kingra> It's obviously omid
[2:36:22] <kn1gh75> Isn't the point of a firing line is so know one know who made the killing shot
[2:36:23] <ammobasket> executed
[2:36:24] <%dukenux> Executed
[2:36:25] <CandideCamera> Part of the point of a firing line was that no one guy has to take responsibility for the kill, since everyone shot at once and it'd be hard to tell who hit
[2:36:30] <%Klonoa__> Our good pal brennan
[2:36:33] <+brightman42> yep
[2:36:35] <Solidnick18> oh executed
[2:36:39] <%huskarl_zap> Was it Miko and Watame who killed Korone.
[2:36:40] <+Mijymish> @kn1gh75 yeah, but they don't have a magic death watch
[2:36:40] <%PettyFunk> But we have magic
[2:36:42] <AFewGoodTaters> player of the game
[2:36:46] <tranquilturnip> yes LUL
[2:36:48] <%ZE_Count> MAGIC CLOCK
[2:36:51] <amask777> they didn't hand out blanks
[2:36:53] <+JustToWatch> no firing lines have only blank
[2:36:55] <TheTunnelSn8ke> I bet the ship sway didn't help.
[2:36:56] <+Mijymish> yeah, a MURDER
[2:36:56] <tonfirean> Utterly defeated by insurance investigators
[2:36:58] <gryffinp> Well... he's being executed for MURDER
[2:36:59] <tranquilturnip> Of Corpse
[2:36:59] <+JustToWatch> only one blank
[2:37:02] <+Mijymish> Nunzio
[2:37:02] <+teavian> LUL
[2:37:03] <%Radski5> The reason they had firing LINES rather than a single executioner was to diffuse responsibility for who fired the killing shot, as well as the obvious fact guns are super inaccurate.
[2:37:04] <%Undenizen> the victim!
[2:37:04] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> The Italian guy or something.
[2:37:06] <%ZE_Count> the murder victim
[2:37:06] <%CommanderSqueaks> @tranquilturnip Booo
[2:37:06] <Solidnick18> LUL
[2:37:07] <BinaryBetrayer> Nuncio Pazcua
[2:37:08] <%AncelDeLambert> No, in this case the weapons of the time were so inaccurate, they needed a line to be sure SOMEONE hit
[2:37:08] <gryffinp> Nusca Pardo!
[2:37:09] <+mczarklesby> First best Italian.
[2:37:10] <turbofolk> Naruto
[2:37:11] <TheTunnelSn8ke> The Vinny.
[2:37:11] <Saltmeisterr> executed pat
[2:37:11] <lloyddboy> NUTS CAPARDOO
[2:37:12] <+brightman42> he sounds like a prize box fighter
[2:37:12] <%PettyFunk> "What!? There's another corpse HERE???" How many times will we hear this, hahaha
[2:37:12] <%redrins> poopoo
[2:37:12] <%spiritofmojave> Nuzlocke Farto
[2:37:14] <%walternatorz> ghost fart
[2:37:14] <%dukenux> Nazca Pardo
[2:37:16] <%CursedNobleman> i see dead people
[2:37:19] <brachydios777> This game is crazy
[2:37:23] <Orenjevel> I could never remember all these names
[2:37:27] <%Shubreaker> the wheel of fate is turning
[2:37:31] <+Flambage> @PatStaresAt
[2:37:33] <@SoFarFetched> yeah guns sucked back then
[2:37:35] <%PettyFunk> Porque no los dos
[2:37:35] <%Faustgesicht> muskets can't hit shit
[2:37:36] <%goatbait> 20% chance of hitting
[2:37:37] <%spiritofmojave> That'd be interesting/make sense
[2:37:37] <%Promessa_EX> not at 5 meters
[2:37:39] <wruce__billis> @PatStaresAt "guns at the time were bad" is completely wrong. This takes place after the 1860's, rifles got super accurate due to the minet ball and, well, rifling.
[2:37:39] <%Parapattern> It's probably a little of both
[2:37:40] <Solidnick18> um
[2:37:42] <%Radski5> It's a combination of both.
[2:37:42] <%Pyroclase> Imagine if everyone missed and they had to spent two minutes reloading their muskets
[2:37:43] <%Monkeyweed21> Guns sucked ass until the 1860's
[2:37:43] <%dukenux> yes? :)
[2:37:43] <%huskarl_zap> smoothboar
[2:37:44] <%TheFabledAble> muskets had insane spin
[2:37:45] <%BubbaRands> Tell us the lesson that we should learn
[2:37:45] <%ringabal> WHO'S TALKING
[2:37:47] <%huskarl_zap> bore
[2:37:47] <brachydios777> Damn
[2:37:48] <TheTunnelSn8ke> XCOM accuracy back in the day
[2:37:49] <%Dfreddy8> Imagine missing all 4 shots
[2:37:50] <%GoCoSpace> Between inaccuracy and jams, yeah it was a humane thing to make sure multiple shots hit
[2:37:52] <BinaryBetrayer> Signor
[2:37:54] <%spiritofmojave> :)
[2:37:54] <%Undenizen> I MEAN. Muskets could hit shit 8 feet in front of them.
[2:37:55] <Orenjevel> Maaan, imagine being on the firing line and everyone just WHIFFS
[2:37:57] <%huskarl_zap> smoothbore
[2:37:58] <%Promessa_EX> even unrifled can make a hit at 50+ meters
[2:37:58] <%GoCoSpace> Stops a guy screaming in pain for ages
[2:37:59] <%dukenux> Kappa
[2:38:00] <gryffinp> We're all fine here. How are you?
[2:38:03] <thatonepassionbentgamer> Super Suspicious, mate
[2:38:04] <%Faustgesicht> Nichols, you motherfucker
[2:38:05] <gryffinp> hm
[2:38:06] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Orenjevel There are cases of it ABSOLUTELY happening
[2:38:07] <+Mijymish> LET ME HELP YOU TO DIE
[2:38:11] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Fucking British asshole
[2:38:11] <%BubbaRands> SIGNOR
[2:38:14] <gryffinp> that doesn't LOOK like an asian man
[2:38:15] <librettodude> The Actual Murder is easiest to solve LUL
[2:38:16] <%spiritofmojave> Isn't anyone on this ship nice or sane LUL
[2:38:17] <pth88> all firing squads use multiple people to reduce guilt of causing the death
[2:38:26] <+Mijymish> look at the faces and think which one looks italian
[2:38:28] <%dashmatt> Look how they massacred my boy!
[2:38:28] <terminusterminal> Did Lucas Pope do he music here too?

[2:41:58] <+Mijymish> blud
[2:41:58] <%benjiFG> the goat was the origami killer all along
[2:41:58] <%Parapattern> This game demonstrates how much potential is wasted by most AAA games in what you can actually do with video games as a medium.
[2:42:00] <NBD_Rab> the blood gets off here
[2:42:00] <%bugz_munny> YEYEYEYYE THIS DECK

[2:42:23] <ThirdPersonPhil> Ohh boy the game is about to get cool
[2:42:27] <librettodude> If you were thinking of playing this game, this is the time to look away
[2:42:27] <TheTunnelSn8ke> There's a well-hidden body in this deck you might overlook the first time. Just a heads up.
[2:42:29] <%CommanderSqueaks> @AFewGoodTaters MAYBE!?

[2:42:49] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt bags of gunpoder

[2:53:59] <kazadaz> yah
[2:54:00] <TheTunnelSn8ke> Correct.
[2:54:00] <gryffinp> more or less
[2:54:00] <%PettyFunk> Omid is the only Persian, he's in the front of one of the pictures!
[2:54:01] <SGrim> Most of it
[2:54:02] <+RhaskaFyraska> Oh my god
[2:54:02] <%dukenux> more or less
[2:54:02] <amask777> there's an achievement the captain did it - where you erroneously say the Captain murdered everyone and leave the ship
[2:54:02] <%MidnightBurst12> yes
[2:54:03] <+mczarklesby> Mostly yeah.
[2:54:04] <%huskarl_zap> 69 KreyGasm

[2:54:05] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt Did you two hear about eh guy that was fired because he didn't want to use the Vietnamese student's name in public...the name was phuc bui... I think he was kinda justified for that.
[2:54:06] <%dashmatt> part Iraq too
[2:54:06] <+ThomasOfTroy> Roughly
[2:54:06] <%PettyFunk> Only Persian looking guy
[2:54:06] <BinaryBetrayer> It's complicated
[2:54:07] <%CommanderSqueaks> Yes
[2:54:12] <+ThomasOfTroy> Paige, no
[2:54:13] <%Faustgesicht> wellikers wellikers wellikers
[2:54:13] <%cureneckbeard> yes
[2:54:16] <+DinnerCalzone> Not Arabic LUL
[2:54:17] <Superfly_Magpie> bigger than Iran but yes
[2:54:18] <reonome> it wasn't arabic paige
[2:54:19] <%Dfreddy8> IT WAS HINDU
[2:54:19] <librettodude> Big Confusion
[2:54:20] <Dumple_Roe> Part Iran, Part Itaq
[2:54:20] <ItIsSky> Iran is Farsi
[2:54:22] <%MSN04_Sazabi> Persia was always Iran, also Farsi is not Arabic
[2:54:22] <professorno> It was hindi or something indian
[2:54:22] <%PettyFunk> Paige the language earlier was Hindi, and it was an Indian guy speaking.
[2:54:23] <%dukenux> not arabic
[2:54:23] <%LiquidDinosaur> Yes
[2:54:24] <+ThomasOfTroy> They speak Farsi
[2:54:25] <%benjiFG> escape? no, murder.
[2:54:27] <RedPlasticCup> starBOG
[2:54:28] <%cureneckbeard> the language was hindi
[2:54:28] <%LiquidDinosaur> No it's 1:1
[2:54:28] <kazadaz> "Persia" is a foreigner-name, "Iran" is the Iranian name
[2:54:29] <televisedrevolting> Istanbul was Constantinople, but now it's Istanbul, not Constantinople.
[2:54:31] <TheTunnelSn8ke> Though the language Syed speks is Hindi
[2:54:32] <a_mad_dragon> what the fuck kind of sailor tattoo is that?
[2:54:35] <amask777> took me forever to find that tattoo
[2:54:38] <%Treuan> A top man
[2:54:39] <%huskarl_zap> we call them Saracens
[2:54:39] <%Parapattern> Well done
[2:54:41] <%MSN04_Sazabi> Persia was just a western name for Iran that was used until 1935 or something
[2:54:42] <%king_wragles> Persia was HUGE
[2:54:43] <%LiquidDinosaur> Persia==Iran
[2:54:48] <Solidnick18> noice
[2:54:50] <+Mijymish> @a_mad_dragon the clipart kind lol

[2:55:48] <%goatbait> Is brute force cheating??
[2:55:49] <%TIME_PUNCHER> Guesstimations
[2:55:53] <%CommanderSqueaks> Stop brute forcing it you loser.
[2:55:53] <+Trunksmad> And they ignore the guy in the other bunk bed next to the dieing guy
[2:55:53] <TheTunnelSn8ke> Tough to bruteforce when there's three of them
[2:55:55] <%ZE_Count> Dot try to force it pat
[2:55:56] <%jerree66> Brute force isn't cheating guys
[2:56:01] <terminusterminal> They're sooo close
[2:56:09] <Solidnick18> oh
[2:56:09] <%spiritofmojave> Brute force is an anti-cheat method LUL

[2:56:49] <+mczarklesby> Laudinum is opium in alcohol.
[2:56:50] <%dashmatt> old school painliller
[2:56:51] <%PettyFunk> Laudanum is old timey morphine
[2:56:51] <%Pookiedaexzile> I leave for 2 hours all of a sudden PAt is hunting for Indian guys

[2:57:03] <%TIME_PUNCHER> DON'T DEAD, OPEN INSIDE
[2:57:04] <%Broand> Laudanum is totally poison anyway tho
[2:57:13] <CoffeeSlice> Pat
[2:57:17] <%walternatorz> you might be able to eliminate more people from bunks
[2:57:19] <%CommanderSqueaks> Laudanum is poison, but it wouldn't kill you fast enough to die on this boat.
[2:57:19] <%Broand> Like its not good to have
[2:57:19] <%Mr_Pylon> But he had a bunk in the other one...
[2:57:19] <%huskarl_zap> GETTIN LIT panicBasket

[2:57:25] <Man_in_the_Red> what was Consumption named after back in these days
[2:57:25] <%Radski5> Laudanum is super toxic but functs like morphine.
[2:57:25] <wruce__billis> @PatStaresAt a lascar house is where people from india lived when they were in england. this info doesn't mean anything, i just hink it's neat
[2:57:26] <+Grayhammatter> LUL

[3:05:05] <gryffinp> I like how "spiked" auto-fills in with "By a terrible beast"

[3:07:36] <%CommanderSqueaks> So he was too much of a bitch to handle the slaughter of a cow, but was enough of a baller to jump on a crab ON FIRE.

[3:09:56] <%chanseychild> as if i needed another reason to fear japanese spider crabs
[3:09:57] <%Spudnacious_Dynasty> This ship sucks the best
[3:09:58] <terminusterminal> Did you guys expect the Kraken to be the LEAST INTERESTING part of this super cool game?
[3:09:58] <+It_sjustjoey> What if sick ppl became crab?
[3:09:59] <%MSN04_Sazabi> I don'tthink insurance covers any of this shit
[3:10:01] <+ShinBojangles> WWWOOOOOOOOOO
[3:10:01] <startstoprepeat> it's fun because everyone gets spoiled on the kraken and assumes that's like an endgame reveal
[3:10:01] <%AncelDeLambert> Ship of the GET FUCKED
[3:10:03] <+brightman42> big backtracking, yeah
[3:10:03] <kazadaz> those guys'll never get AHEAD with that attitude
[3:10:03] <MildMannered_Creighton> look like crab, talk like people

[3:10:11] <deafmutelaughing> you'll have to backtrack basically the entire game. it's intended
[3:10:11] <%Pookiedaexzile> When you just walk up riding a crab like sup bitch
[3:10:12] <%CommanderSqueaks> Oh shit, right, this is an insurance report this guy is submitting. WHO is going to believe this shit?
[3:10:14] <tonfirean> "Act of God"
[3:10:14] <%honeyman18> BIG CRAB MURDERS
[3:10:14] <gryffinp> Honestly it's reasonable to just go straight through a chapter, and then go back and meticulously go through it at a pace of your choosing
[3:10:14] <%MidnightBurst12> there's gonna be alot of that
[3:10:15] <%toastybites> solve the ones you know first
[3:10:19] <+Mijymish> @MSN04_Sazabi You'd be surprised.
[3:10:26] <Amadeusguy> The amount of shit these people had to go through all because of a freaking shell really sucks eh?

[3:10:38] <AFewGoodTaters> ü¶Ä
[3:10:39] <+TombstoneTTromboners> @CommanderSqueaks "Well you see, a large portion of the ship was killed by Crab Riders"
[3:10:40] <annearkie> I'm really enjoying getting here late and having absolutely no clue about anything here. like a puzzle but I'm drunk and scared R)
[3:10:42] <gryffinp> Poor nick
[3:10:44] <ShineTheDiamond> Even minor injuries could be deadly due to the lack of medical knowledge and unsanitary conditions. Sea life was brutal
[3:10:44] <+Mijymish> @Amadeusguy To be fair, it is a very purty shell
[3:10:46] <silverira> did they found One Piece?
[3:10:49] <thatonepassionbentgamer> PFFFT

[3:11:10] <$TehPryceIsRight> This is what happens when you go peepee in the ocean too much.
[3:11:10] <%arcanemacrocosm> you'd think the craziest thing would be attacked by a kraken, but i guess not
[3:11:11] <%Pookiedaexzile> Has anyone made this joke yet " This game screams, I make good models but animation is hard"
[3:11:11] <%dashmatt> A cathulu
[3:11:11] <%Nupinoop296> dude's aim was off by a bit

[3:11:28] <%Onmi_Khaos> No they "Already got Nick"
[3:11:29] <TheTunnelSn8ke> Half-second before disaster on the dude on his knees
[3:11:29] <+wellshuckit> @PatStaresAt came for the open sea, stayed for the crab people.
[3:11:33] <$Falilth> bloodborne shit
[3:11:35] <reonome> CRAB PEOPLE CRAB PEOPLE
[3:11:35] <%Forente> you have angered the crab people
[3:11:37] <%PettyFunk> These crab boys were CLEANING UP
[3:11:40] <startstoprepeat> "it's already done for nick" is a different sentence from "it's already done for, nick"
[3:11:41] <%dashmatt> Love that design
[3:11:41] <+ALazo> Oh, there are motherfuckers riding the crabs?
[3:11:41] <+Grayhammatter> wow, those above deck got FUCKED
[3:11:42] <Lord_of_all_Edges> Simple elementary, death by spider monster
[3:11:43] <%CommanderSqueaks> C R A B P E O P LE
[3:11:45] <%PlagueOfGripes> these are clearly deep sea dark wraiths doubling as nazguls
[3:11:45] <%Cavumentum> Crab Riders

[3:11:52] <CoffeeSlice> you angered the crabbo you get the stabbo
[3:11:53] <%joylent_blue> ok the crab dudes are legit terrifying
[3:11:53] <+Mijymish> @reonome I've been wanting to sing than since you asked
[3:11:53] <%Onmi_Khaos> That guy was noping the fuck out!
[3:11:54] <%Mister_McDerp> the crab riders have come for vengeance
[3:11:54] <%ringabal> Scuze me m'am, did your husband have Crab insurance?
[3:11:58] <%Piemen99> OK YEAH I WOULD MUTINY AS WELL AFTER ALL THIS
[3:12:01] <%CommanderSqueaks> This is what happens when you litter, Pat.
[3:12:02] <%Allenora> The music is so jaunty
[3:12:05] <%gupple_> the giant enemy crab
[3:12:05] <kazadaz> It's weird how crabs are 90% the same as spiders, but only 20% as creepy
[3:12:07] <%spiritofmojave> Crab Riders would be a cool band name
[3:12:13] <%DakotaMacDoodle> This is some cursed shit
[3:12:19] <+FatherGreyBeard> I cannot blame anyone for wanting to desert atthis point
[3:12:22] <$Falilth> @kazadaz it's because they are delicous
[3:12:24] <%ZE_Count> tommahawk
[3:12:27] <+Grayhammatter> parried
[3:12:29] <Lord_of_all_Edges> axe immunity
[3:12:30] <%Piemono> To be honest, after all this monster shit a mutiny seems pretty reasonable
[3:12:31] <ThirdPersonPhil> Got parried
[3:12:35] <%AncelDeLambert> ninja parry
[3:12:35] <%Dfreddy8> Was his name Matt?

[3:12:37] <Lord_of_all_Edges> immune to axes
[3:12:37] <+schlager087> oh man, can you imagine getting told your beloved was murdered by Crab Demons
[3:12:39] <%kewlmyc> HE SCREM
[3:12:40] <%PettyFunk> @kazadaz I'd say similarly creepy, but a very different flavor. More fear of the unknown, rather than something close to home.
[3:12:42] <%CommanderSqueaks> Maybe don't DECLARE you are attacking someone before you attack them Big Brain.
[3:12:43] <%PlagueOfGripes> your coverage does not cover death at the hands of abyssal crab warlords ma'am
[3:12:43] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Triling as Crab Centaurs
[3:12:46] <televisedrevolting> This Insurance Claims gonna be a payload.
[3:12:50] <turf_wind_and_fire> Dude that crew stuck around for crab people AND a Kraken before they mutinied. That‚Äôs pretty fucking loyal.
[3:12:50] <TheTunnelSn8ke> That one got turned into a party skewer.
[3:12:52] <+Trunksmad> There was a game that showed those long legged crabs
[3:12:53] <Man_in_the_Red> @kazadaz i mean, those giant, invasive spider crabs are pretty freaky, enough no one buys them to eat
[3:12:55] <BinaryBetrayer> No kidding, There was no mention of big Kaiju fights on the brochure, i'm sure.
[3:12:55] <%Pookiedaexzile> Bruh they got killed by the red dude from Don't hug me I'm scared
[3:12:58] <librettodude> This game really knows how to earn its drama
[3:12:59] <%AncelDeLambert> this is the best loading screen
[3:13:05] <%CommanderSqueaks> WHO IS GETTING THIS INSURANCE PAYOUT!?
[3:13:06] <Lord_of_all_Edges> mutiny but also crab people
[3:13:09] <%SomersaultJustice> DUDUH
[3:13:10] <%AncelDeLambert> Ghost farts are a great system for loading

[3:14:29] <BinaryBetrayer> Because goats stink big time
[3:14:29] <+thekerobit> its their natural habitat
[3:14:29] <%spiritofmojave> of course
[3:14:29] <%GingerStrawhat> Possibly for the milk
[3:14:30] <%PlagueOfGripes> goats love nothing
[3:14:31] <%MidnightBurst12> space?
[3:14:31] <Lord_of_all_Edges> it's to show the goat the ocean
[3:14:31] <+brightman42> needs fresh air?
[3:14:31] <Potatoidea> Didn't know
[3:14:32] <%Spudnacious_Dynasty> Good luck goat
[3:14:39] <%Spudnacious_Dynasty> m[
[3:14:39] <%chanseychild> symbolic?
[3:14:39] <$dalmek> GOAT stands for GOAT On Atop TheDeck
[3:14:40] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Nick?
[3:14:41] <+Mijymish> Meat tastes better when it's free-range?
[3:14:41] <%Archphronimos> goats also give milk
[3:14:41] <%CommanderSqueaks> That goat was just KIDDING around.
[3:14:41] <+FatherGreyBeard> Speared
[3:14:41] <%king_wragles> True fact: Goat are descended from mermaids, that's why they're so attractive.
[3:14:42] <%DakotaMacDoodle> it likes to feel tall
[3:14:43] <ammobasket> Goats were the first shipwrights
[3:14:43] <%CommanderSqueaks> Eh, eeeeh?
[3:14:45] <tranquilturnip> goats love trash
[3:14:46] <%Klonoa__> not in this one no
[3:14:47] <%Pookiedaexzile> @PlagueOfGripes Get Turned down buddy
[3:14:47] <%ZE_Count> you hear his name pat
[3:14:48] <Potatoidea> Beyonce loves the ocean?
[3:14:49] <ginnypigz> Goats love eating garbage
[3:14:49] <%CommanderSqueaks> YEET
[3:14:51] <ThirdPersonPhil> it needs to sunbath so it can do Photosynthesis
[3:14:51] <turf_wind_and_fire> ITS WHY THEY LIVE IN THE OCEAN
[3:14:52] <%Ranryu692> it's why they climb mountains: so they can see the ocean
[3:14:53] <%cvp5127> yeeted
[3:14:54] <gryffinp> At least this dude's death was fun
[3:14:55] <%spiritofmojave> goats enjoy woolieTRASH
[3:14:57] <thatonepassionbentgamer> That dude's going back to his home planet
[3:14:59] <%arcanemacrocosm> goat kids are cute

[3:15:03] <terminusterminal> Nah that dude got rocked
[3:15:06] <turf_wind_and_fire> YEET
[3:15:06] <reonome> cause of death: yeet
[3:15:07] <librettodude> The density of deaths on this ship is ASTONISHING
[3:15:09] <%PlagueOfGripes> "you know nothing of my work" - goat
[3:15:09] <+Mijymish> Just not yet
[3:15:09] <terminusterminal> But you'll see it's so crazy
[3:15:12] <televisedrevolting> That man was dead before he hit the ground apparently.
[3:15:13] <%SaiyanShoto> You got something against goats?
[3:15:13] <delerim001> that guy was the unlukest
[3:15:14] <Lord_of_all_Edges> "Yup. That's me. Being flung through the air by a crab person. I bet you're wondering how I ended up like this. Well it all started..."
[3:15:15] <terminusterminal> He wasn't thrown
[3:15:16] <$Caped_Eggy> Like a hero
[3:15:16] <%Piemen99> @gryffinp oh yeah totally
[3:15:16] <ammobasket> bullseye
[3:15:16] <terminusterminal> I think
[3:15:19] <%Archphronimos> Goats, naturally seaborne creatures that hunt rats, which, as we all know, cannot swim
[3:15:20] <%honeyman18> Goat needs a sailor suit and cap
[3:15:20] <%weissguard> Back BROKEN.
[3:15:21] <%huskarl_zap> it's a brothel goat
[3:15:21] <%doc_ock_rokc> sweet throw
[3:15:21] <terminusterminal> Oh yeah
[3:15:21] <Zebekis> "Yote by a terrible beast"
[3:15:23] <terminusterminal> OH YEAH
[3:15:23] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Goats can't float, just like rats can't swim.

[3:15:55] <+Mijymish> Go read the glossary
[3:15:56] <ammobasket> it's a relevant question, given the crab riders
[3:15:57] <+Grayhammatter> oh my god
[3:15:57] <+TombstoneTTromboners> imagine all this shit happened and you're the guy who got done in by fucking lightning
[3:15:58] <%chanseychild> well this is just getting even worse somehow

[3:16:20] <%Spydurman> talk about FUCKING CURSED
[3:16:23] <silverira> at least it was it was a instant death
[3:16:27] <Mr_Rakjo> BIG CURSE
[3:16:28] <Amadeusguy> Like, every time they get to a new memory it's like 'fuck, that's rough man'
[3:16:28] <%Parapattern> Jaws on the floor
[3:16:29] <%honeyman18> Zeus' pissed
[3:16:29] <TheTunnelSn8ke> That topman died in the most metal way
[3:16:29] <+Loinclothiclese> This shit is mega cursed!
[3:16:30] <+Trunksmad> heading off to gunda maxiboost on. laters
[3:16:30] <fjordicjordic> This game is so harrowing
[3:16:31] <+Grayhammatter> this ship is fucking CURSED
[3:16:31] <+Mijymish> Figure out who does the rigging, it'll help identify a buncha folks
[3:16:31] <%weissguard> Are they in the middle of a storm or something?
[3:16:34] <+schlager087> unfortunate
[3:16:34] <%PlagueOfGripes> trying to lower the main
[3:16:34] <%Spudnacious_Dynasty> This cruise stinks
[3:16:34] <a_mad_dragon> this fucking boat
[3:16:35] <%goose_attack_almanac> Can you see Crabbos?
[3:16:36] <Orenjevel> Wizard Crabs???
[3:16:37] <%Sol_Install> this cursed item really must be worth it
[3:16:37] <%marsantas> This game is THE BEST, I can't wait for his next game
[3:16:38] <%Klonoa__> cuuuursed
[3:16:39] <Zebekis> Crabmage cast Thundaga
[3:16:39] <+schlager087> that guy got off the best so far
[3:16:40] <Lord_of_all_Edges> at least he was spared the crab people
[3:16:40] <MistahMrMatt> the music is fuckin with me lol
[3:16:40] <kazadaz> I love that you actually get to use the "electrocuted" cause
[3:16:41] <%MidnightBurst12> or planned
[3:16:41] <dragonofdojima6> Boats cursed *Loads blunderbuss*
[3:16:42] <%questionablemat> he will be one of the people allowed to climb ropes
[3:16:42] <BinaryBetrayer> So these crab people can cast miracles
[3:16:44] <%Pyroclase> TBF it's not hard to get hit by lightning in the rigging in the middle of the ocean
[3:16:45] <tonfirean> Or fortunate, given what happened to some of these other people
[3:16:46] <%MayorRev> These guys are QUADRUPLE CURSED
[3:16:46] <gryffinp> @weissguard The storm JUST rolled up on them all unnaturallike
[3:16:46] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat, he probably had the LEAST painful death of everyone who died on this boat.
[3:16:49] <yeetdabsenpai69> @ze_count old age?
[3:16:51] <madskull456> lol leaving the ship dont seem to crazy
[3:16:51] <%Frost_Quill> Considering what happened like right after he probably suffered less than a LOT of the other guys.
[3:16:54] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Lightning was a distraction
[3:17:06] <delerim001> good look with those guys
[3:17:08] <AFewGoodTaters> ching chong.
[3:17:08] <+FatherGreyBeard> He was lucky it was just Lightning and not Crabs
[3:17:09] <%CommanderSqueaks> Again, this was probably the LEAST painful death, death by lightning.
[3:17:09] <startstoprepeat> @PatStaresAt if you don't know their name, you could at least assign them a job to make it easier later
[3:17:09] <Man_in_the_Red> i assumed the door opening was the memory exit
[3:17:10] <+TombstoneTTromboners> there's the door
[3:17:11] <%weissguard> @gryffinp NotLikeThis This crew can't catch a break.
[3:17:12] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Literally cursed by the ocean
[3:17:13] <grimwire1> this is come fucken final distention shit
[3:17:13] <+Grayhammatter> 2 of 8?!
[3:17:16] <Lord_of_all_Edges> the lightning was the true culprit, the crab people were the distraction
[3:17:16] <%CommanderSqueaks> @AFewGoodTaters no
[3:17:17] <%spiritofmojave> OF 8
[3:17:17] <+Grayhammatter> HOLY SHIT
[3:17:18] <%Pookiedaexzile> IF you have Lightning why send the crab men
[3:17:19] <%Parapattern> It's just comical at that point
[3:17:19] <%chanseychild> sluuuuuuuurrrrp
[3:17:20] <SGrim> @PettyFunk or worse yet, fallen on his ribs and have his lungs punctured.
[3:17:21] <serrule1> Did they christen this ship the SS CURSED.JPG!?
[3:17:21] <televisedrevolting> @artoriasthetrenchfighter A distraction from Poseidon.

[3:18:32] <Slimeking_Mike> Chat For Christ's Sakes They Dont Want Your Hints And Clue's
[3:18:32] <CandideCamera> luckily Pat is too dumb to be spoiled
[3:18:32] <+Mijymish> Hello, I'm Top Ship-man
[3:18:33] <AnneSQF> ban all of chat
[3:18:37] <gryffinp> emote chat would be such a bummer
[3:18:41] <%bread_assassin> I'm more of a power bottomman
[3:18:41] <+desfore> Also, reading the glossary does help
[3:18:41] <@StridentSong> We're not doing emote only mode
[3:18:43] <%Pookiedaexzile> Ban Humanity
[3:18:44] <%spiritofmojave> Get Elmo to ban me!
[3:18:44] <jubejube56> That guy on the ropes looked like he was climbing down from the top before the crab skewered him
[3:18:47] <ammobasket> mods-only chat
[3:18:51] <%Dfreddy8> It was ZEUS ALL ALONG
[3:18:52] <turf_wind_and_fire> Sub mode maybe?

[3:18:54] <Mr_Rakjo> The dude on the wall?
[3:18:56] <critiquequartz> CHAT no hints
[3:19:02] <%moondog_> it was colonel mustard in the library with the knife
[3:19:02] <Man_in_the_Red> Twitch viewers want to act like their the smartest in the room, and in the pursuit of acting like a smarty pants, will spoil at every oppurtunity
[3:19:04] <+schlager087> emotes only
[3:19:04] <%Daxalog> Im assuming people in chat are probably tryign to figure it out as well
[3:19:06] <%joylent_blue> the dude that gave the hint WAS a sub
[3:19:06] <%CommanderSqueaks> WRONG ANSWERS ONLY
[3:19:07] <+Grayhammatter> da boat
[3:19:07] <%ringabal> Come to the back of da booaaaat
[3:19:08] <@StridentSong> Sub mode if things really get out of hand, but I don't see that happening
[3:19:10] <%Pookiedaexzile> Emote only mode will make everyone spoil TLOU2 using that string someone figured out
[3:19:14] <TheTunnelSn8ke> We've been doing alright so far on the spoiler minimization.
[3:19:15] <@StridentSong> Eventually we're just gonna time out everyone who can't take a hint.
[3:19:19] <%doc_ock_rokc> snape killed aries with rosebud
[3:19:21] <%ZE_Count> DECAPATATIONNNN
[3:19:22] <+Grayhammatter> they both got decapped
[3:19:23] <@SoFarFetched> Sub mode wouldn't really work cause the person who said that and got timed out was a subbed person.

[3:22:27] <gryffinp> The best kind of lovecraft shit is the unexpected lovecraft shit
[3:22:28] <%CommanderSqueaks> I was expecting Lovecraft solely because of the art style and because it happened on a boat.

[3:22:32] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Zebekis old gods
[3:22:36] <@StridentSong> Paige, I'm going to turn on Non-Mod Chat delay. It causes messages to not appear in chat until a few seconds have passed. It allows us to time things out before they're even visible.

[3:23:24] <+FatherGreyBeard> Woudln't that be a beast? The descrpiton of enemy implies it's a human, i think
[3:23:26] <%cureneckbeard> N I C C
[3:23:30] <terminusterminal> Maybe Nick's short for Huang Li
[3:23:35] <kingra> The creatures RIDING the beasts are enemys

[3:50:33] <+TombstoneTTromboners> this is why we should have never gone to the ocean
[3:50:34] <%Daniel_Is_I> At least the guards learned to shoot on sight
[3:50:35] <+Mijymish> And the merpeople put on crazy robe outfits to ride the crabs.
[3:50:36] <+Ancopro> Obra deez nuts
[3:50:37] <cipher758> fuck

[3:50:39] <%PettyFunk> @SjoeB89 See, you say that, but I don't believe you.
[3:50:39] <%CommanderSqueaks> So it's literally all this person's fault?
[3:50:41] <gryffinp> "man it sure seems like some crazy shit happened on these rowboats. I don't envy the guy who's job it is to figure out what it was. ...Oh wait."
[3:50:43] <deafmutelaughing> I love and hate this chapter
[3:50:44] <@PlagueOfGripes> six, six mertits! gahaha!
[3:50:45] <%huskarl_zap> Is this a Light House prequel?
[3:50:45] <%MakotoPB> looks like plague got a new project
[3:50:45] <%Onmi_Khaos> The Kick Off it seems
[3:50:45] <%TIME_PUNCHER> Mammary glands seem really fucking useless on fish people
[3:50:47] <%crimsonharvest> i love the vocabulary in this game, my dad's a sailor and taught me some, this is neat
[3:50:50] <KitsuneCrew> He just wanted some sweet fish pussy and ended up getting shot :(
[3:50:51] <gryffinp> and he fucking deserved it
[3:50:51] <%UvBenServed> NICHOLS
[3:50:52] <BinaryBetrayer> Pretty much. It's all Edward's fault
[3:50:52] <%Mister_McDerp> one guy ruins it
[3:50:55] <lessthanhuman_tv> the age old question, mermaid or fish with human bottom?
[3:50:59] <+desfore> Formosa

[3:51:02] <turf_wind_and_fire> There‚Äôs nothing quite worth the price of fish titties
[3:51:03] <%BinaryFireball> wouldn't he already be dead?
[3:51:05] <+Merhabi> who's calling why are we calling, stop doing that
[3:51:12] <+Mijymish> @CommanderSqueaks Kinda, yeah.
[3:51:16] <Tisaric> I love how much time jumping you do in the process, it's really fun to piece that all together
[3:51:17] <+duckmeat_woohoo> holy shit paige

[3:51:29] <@commanderclaw> BUT BABA
[3:51:29] <TheTunnelSn8ke> There's two male names to pick from.
[3:51:30] <%spiritofmojave> snort LUL
[3:51:30] <%CommanderSqueaks> LUL
[3:51:31] <%KilogramHours> You could brute force it

[3:51:35] <alexandrecau> baba is topman
[3:51:36] <%joylent_blue> strong snort
[3:51:37] <%ShichiNoBushi> "Unknown Passenger"
[3:51:39] <+Mijymish> Hok-Seng was one guard. But you have to figure out whether It-Beng or Chioh is guard or prince
[3:51:39] <%Onmi_Khaos> Paige is correct
[3:51:39] <%CommanderSqueaks> HONK
[3:51:39] <%TIME_PUNCHER> same convo, different phrasing
[3:51:41] <%PettyFunk> Hok was the guy who got framed
[3:51:44] <%Piemen99> BABA IS THE NAME
[3:51:45] <%ssjklyco> who's in first
[3:51:47] <gryffinp> Pat has forgotten that hok seng lau was the dude who got executioned
[3:51:48] <kazadaz> You don't ever have to guess (but like 80% of players did at least a little guessing)
[3:51:48] <TheTunnelSn8ke> Hok-seng Lau was the executed Formosan.
[3:51:56] <+desfore> @PeachSaliva They don't give you every single name. You have to guess sometimes base off clues
[3:51:56] <lloyddboy> WALK ON WATER
[3:52:01] <ThirdPersonPhil> This cheat would only work if you have other 2 Correct guesses waiting for approval
[3:52:03] <@StridentSong> This is such a good chapter
[3:52:04] <%CommanderSqueaks> How did YOU die?
[3:52:08] <%TheBitingIrish> But you couldn't see his face while he was executed, soooo

[3:52:27] <+Grayhammatter> this game is wild

[3:52:30] <BinaryBetrayer> This part gets even weirder
[3:52:31] <ItIsSky> I love this game
[3:52:33] <librettodude> @TheBitingIrish The game tells you the name, and shows you the portrait at his death
[3:52:33] <%Sol_Install> OH
[3:52:35] <%crimsonharvest> i think this is the kind of surreal fantastic journey the text adventure writers of the 80s wanted to portray, you could read the fiction in the feelies and it was always great
[3:52:37] <@SoFarFetched> Yes it was too much info.
[3:52:38] <gryffinp> well miss lim was already identified
[3:52:39] <%CommanderSqueaks> Wait this game is getting weirder?
[3:52:45] <%TheBitingIrish> Oh, fucking duh

[3:54:00] <%ZE_Count> Man now I wanna watch g gundam
[3:54:00] <%TheBitingIrish> I think the royals tried to steal the treasure, but one dude brought it back
[3:54:02] <%MakotoPB> @ze_count I appreciate the Gundam reference
[3:54:02] <lessthanhuman_tv> how did this guy possibly get back to the ship after leaving on that tiny thing LUL
[3:54:13] <%CommanderSqueaks> So is the moral of this story is fuck the East India Trading Company?
[3:54:15] <+Blargimazombie> Looks like you've got a baby penis
[3:54:17] <%bread_assassin> So what WAS Pat spoiled on. He seems pretty surprised by all the different plot points.

[3:54:48] <Bouerd> man this ship is all kinds of fucked up
[3:54:50] <ItIsSky> ocean's haunted
[3:54:50] <%king_wragles> @bread_assassin some jerk told him this happens on a boat, can you believe it?

[3:54:58] <kazadaz> and like 65% of the land
[3:55:00] <%crimsonharvest> Space is just an ocean where the water is super far apart
[3:55:00] <%TheBitingIrish> And the jungles :/
[3:55:00] <%ZE_Count> The disney animated Alantis film was really good.
[3:55:00] <vaporousTippler> Ocean's worse. We know shit's in there.

[3:56:47] <OperatorPlease> @korth367 "bleed out" would cover a fourth of the deaths though
[3:56:53] <%Owkono> merdur
[3:56:54] <ThirdPersonPhil> died after a while from something probably
[3:56:54] <%CommanderSqueaks> "I don't know yet." is always a valid answer.

[3:57:01] <gryffinp> I like how pat accurately observed that nichols "cowarded his bitch ass out" like one scene before it is firmly established that that's exactly what he did.

[4:01:01] <lessthanhuman_tv> @fathergreybeard are the mermaids enemies or beasts LUL
[4:01:05] <%BinaryFireball> btw if you guys haven't seen it checkout the BATMETAL mermaider video
[4:01:10] <%CommanderSqueaks> Man this book is very motivational
[4:01:15] <deafmutelaughing> 1/4 done!
[4:01:17] <$Ziegsy> My aunt did this as a job.
[4:01:19] <%CommanderSqueaks> Fuck 1/4th
[4:01:19] <lloyddboy> WOO
[4:01:21] <%CommanderSqueaks> !uptime
[4:01:21] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 1m.
[4:01:21] <balquisa> Death PogChamp
[4:01:22] <+FatherGreyBeard> I'm thinking Beasts
[4:01:22] <+waltzqueen> woo
[4:01:25] <%bread_assassin> Apparently, Beng can either be burnt or electrocuted.
[4:01:25] <Amadeusguy> He's been making pretty good time on this game all things considered.
[4:01:26] <@commanderclaw> This game is fucking metal
[4:01:29] <%MakotoPB> keep going cowards!
[4:01:30] <+TenguGemini> okay so this game looks incredible and I think I need to play it
[4:01:36] <+Mijymish> If the mermaids have a civilization then they're Foreign, otherwise they're Beasts. And that's way overthinking it.
[4:01:38] <+FatherGreyBeard> Drowning?
[4:01:39] <%arancet> and stealin his pants!
[4:01:42] <gryffinp> that guy got it bad
[4:01:43] <%cureneckbeard> !uptime
[4:01:45] <%tolloponik> is this a one off?
[4:01:48] <NeonBleu> he was one day from retirement BibleThump
[4:01:49] <%dashmatt> Hauled down to Davey Jones Locker
[4:01:51] <+TombstoneTTromboners> that's bob
[4:01:51] <lloyddboy> YEET
[4:01:52] <%Commiekin> beast
[4:01:53] <+desfore> BEAST
[4:01:56] <Man_in_the_Red> yes
[4:01:56] <+brightman42> beast
[4:01:57] <%chambatron> Beast
[4:01:57] <Mr_Rakjo> beast
[4:01:57] <Bouerd> that is a beast
[4:01:58] <%Mister_McDerp> spiked by beast
[4:01:58] <+Kitafin> beast
[4:02:01] <+krawtch> he looks like he died of natural causes
[4:02:01] <+mczarklesby> They actually say it somewhere, but I can't remember if it counts as spoiler to say.
[4:02:02] <%Commiekin> foreign enemy means "a human from another country"
[4:02:03] <+FatherGreyBeard> Humans are Enemies, i think
[4:02:04] <Zap_Rowsdower32> Beasts
[4:02:05] <%cureneckbeard> mans are enemy
[4:02:06] <jubejube56> Look at those nails, it is a beast for sure
[4:02:07] <%marsantas> BEAST, enemy is ONLY human
[4:02:08] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Beast is non-human
[4:02:09] <%Pookiedaexzile> Sex Machine
[4:02:09] <OperatorPlease> @PatStaresAt the game considers "enemy" to mean "foreign nation"
[4:02:11] <Tisaric> enemy means human
[4:02:14] <Amadeusguy> I think it might actually be either
[4:02:15] <kingra> Mermaids are people üò°
[4:02:22] <TheTunnelSn8ke> She sells seashells
[4:02:24] <%MidnightBurst12> could be either
[4:02:27] <Huntercd> Mermurder
[4:02:29] <%Pookiedaexzile> PAT
[4:02:32] <+The_Protagonist> he clearly tripped and fell onto that spear
[4:02:37] <+waltzqueen> @kingra yeah but its the 1800s everyone is racist
[4:02:38] <Max_Millien> its the foreign city state of atlantis
[4:02:40] <cipher758> sick aim
[4:02:48] <deafmutelaughing> they're doin some pretty terrible things!
[4:02:49] <%Commiekin> look they're british they're kinda shitty about people
[4:02:49] <vladhelsin> Yo i forgot how cool this game is
[4:02:49] <%Daniel_Is_I> They can spike cannon you, Paige
[4:02:52] <%chambatron> theyre kinda hot tbh
[4:02:52] <%PettyFunk> How can something with so many nipples be terrible?
[4:02:55] <%CommanderSqueaks> Peach they LITERALLY ATE AND STABBED EVERYONE
[4:02:56] <+krawtch> speared by a fine-ass sea beast
[4:02:58] <turbofolk> THESE MERMAIDS ARE QUEENS
[4:03:02] <%ZE_Count> 1803 people were sea racist and normal racist
[4:03:03] <+desfore> @PeachSaliva This is the 1800's. Anything that's not a white englishman is "Terrible"
[4:03:05] <Man_in_the_Red> Imagine
[4:03:07] <%Commiekin> oh you wear weird shirts? barbarians. - the british
[4:03:13] <librettodude> This game is FULL of very intentional and deliberate design, as all good mysteries are
[4:03:13] <Huntercd> Fish parts
[4:03:15] <%LiquidDinosaur> are giant crabs beasts or enemies?
[4:03:15] <%cureneckbeard> Didn't someone earlier say that people are enemy and non-humanlike creatures are beasts
[4:03:17] <%LouieRouie> Yeah but they're hot
[4:03:19] <+Mijymish> @CommanderSqueaks Now that's going far, they didn't eat anyone!
[4:03:21] <gryffinp> they KNEW it was gonna go bad
[4:03:23] <%EyeFarted> Oh course Ms. Undyne Cosplay would find the fish beasts attractive.
[4:03:24] <gryffinp> and they were RIGHT
[4:03:27] <+Grayhammatter> oh fuck
[4:03:33] <@PlagueOfGripes> is she tied up....
[4:03:35] <%CommanderSqueaks> About monstersACH!
[4:03:36] <%Pookiedaexzile> That American accent on the chinese voice actors is hilarous

[4:03:43] <thatonepassionbentgamer> SICK MATRIX DODGe
[4:03:43] <Man_in_the_Red> thats real close
[4:03:44] <Tisaric> WHAT A GOD
[4:03:45] <BinaryBetrayer> I think you can see the other mermaids in this scene
[4:03:46] <sougoe> Someone fucked up
[4:03:50] <%Faustgesicht> Beng was ready
[4:03:50] <BlacSoul> bitches is gettin SPEARED
[4:03:52] <%tolloponik> nat 20 dex check
[4:03:52] <Slimeking_Mike> It-Beng Sia was a real baller
[4:03:56] <Zebekis> Ultra Instinct Formosan
[4:03:58] <+krawtch> that ocean already got plenty of chests in it
[4:03:58] <Huntercd> So are those fishy bits compatible with humans?
[4:03:58] <gryffinp> well
[4:03:58] <%snow_bush> NIPPLE
[4:03:58] <%jiin6> Harpooned
[4:04:02] <%Commiekin> they weren't kidnapped initially
[4:04:03] <SGrim> Because Britian
[4:04:04] <%count_bob> "Passengers"
[4:04:06] <BinaryBetrayer> Because Nichols fucked up
[4:04:06] <OperatorPlease> formosan ROYALTY
[4:04:06] <$Ziegsy> 'The varnish isnt dry!'
[4:04:07] <%ZE_Count> They got kidnapped off the ship
[4:04:07] <thatonepassionbentgamer> "Passengers"
[4:04:07] <%marsantas> On the BOAT they were passangers
[4:04:07] <%arancet> we were passengers first
[4:04:09] <Man_in_the_Red> its a long ztory
[4:04:10] <%ringabal> Oh god it's like Pirates all over again
[4:04:10] <+TombstoneTTromboners> they were at first
[4:04:11] <%Commiekin> a kidnapping can happen at any moment
[4:04:12] <%Piemono> They were passengers, until they got kidnapped
[4:04:12] <%MidnightBurst12> they got kidnapped off the ship
[4:04:13] <+Mijymish> They were passengers on the ship, they were kidnapped by some of the crew
[4:04:14] <+Kitafin> nick got greddy
[4:04:17] <%bread_assassin> They were kidnapped by the mutineers.
[4:04:17] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> They were passengers...until they weren't
[4:04:18] <%count_bob> ""PASSENGERS""
[4:04:18] <NeonBleu> were they suppose to be luggage?
[4:04:19] <oOZtkOo> "slave" doesnt look good on the roster
[4:04:21] <Amadeusguy> Recall that there was that episode earlier where Nick had kidnapped them
[4:04:23] <+Mijymish> So many mutinies, so little time
[4:04:24] <%ShichiNoBushi> Perhaps passengers initially but kidnapped by these jerks.
[4:04:25] <%marsantas> MUTINY
[4:04:25] <%Piemono> Sailors can be greedy shits
[4:04:26] <deafmutelaughing> they were passengers on the Obra Dinn
[4:04:26] <natebud> Kidnapped from the obra dinn
[4:04:26] <TheTunnelSn8ke> They were taking a boat home to the direction of Taiwan.
[4:04:27] <terminusterminal> I hope Pat eventually figures it out later
[4:04:30] <tranquilturnip> If all else fails you can check the book for the timeline
[4:04:31] <Man_in_the_Red> shit did indeed go down
[4:04:33] <cipher758> these mermaids are thirsty... for BLOOD
[4:04:37] <Man_in_the_Red> give it a minute
[4:04:38] <+brightman42> unknown dumb bitch
[4:04:39] <%Commiekin> do you know where your [LOVED ONES] are?
[4:04:39] <librettodude> Remember that "Signor Nichols" Was stirring shit and framed hok-seng lau
[4:04:44] <KLouDraws> maybe they tried to steal the items and were caught?
[4:04:49] <%CommanderSqueaks> So the Second Mate fucked everyone, got it
[4:05:04] <%LiquidDinosaur> they're Surprise Passengers
[4:05:06] <+brightman42> second mate was a dick, yeah
[4:05:08] <%CommanderSqueaks> They're not even at the cape yet!
[4:05:09] <%jerree66> @CommanderSqueaks typical
[4:05:09] <%ZE_Count> Someone got greedy and did stupid stuff
[4:05:10] <gryffinp> Eventually it may be useful to walk through all of the dialogue in the book in chronological order
[4:05:12] <+Mijymish> @CommanderSqueaks He couldn't have fucked them if the shell wasn't on the ship, but yeah
[4:05:18] <deafmutelaughing> ü§î
[4:05:19] <lessthanhuman_tv> I want to see them beat this :(
[4:05:34] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Mijymish The shell wouldn't have been on the ship if the merpeople didn't attack and the Second Mate didn't coward out.
[4:05:34] <%Commiekin> Return of the Obra Dinn: A catalogue of everything being just the worst
[4:05:35] <tranquilturnip> born rotten
[4:05:36] <+waltzqueen> Human Greed is the root of all sorts of stupid and awful shit
[4:05:41] <Lophostrix_> @lessthanhuman_tv it'll probably take 2 streams
[4:05:45] <gryffinp> shit's locked
[4:05:49] <+Grayhammatter> no fish people here
[4:05:52] <%MelBrooksKA> This is a pretty cool art style
[4:05:53] <%SuckerPunchSyd> shits super locked
[4:05:56] <%CommanderSqueaks> Also why did they decide to drag the mer people onto the boat?
[4:05:59] <+Mijymish> @CommanderSqueaks The chapters are jumping around a TON.
[4:06:05] <Huntercd> so is Pat investigating Cthulhu shenanigans?
[4:06:08] <%MidnightBurst12> @commandersqueaks money
[4:06:08] <TheTunnelSn8ke> Lazarette denied.
[4:06:09] <+brightman42> check doors...he can't see this....
[4:06:11] <+ShinBojangles> isnt there a door that got unlocked earlier?
[4:06:19] <%MelBrooksKA> @CommanderSqueaks They don't seem very smart
[4:06:27] <+schlager087> Insurance Investigator for smash When?
[4:06:28] <Man_in_the_Red> @huntercd it was just an abandoned ship just an hour ago
[4:06:32] <BinaryBetrayer> More like Umberlee shenanigans
[4:06:37] <%Commiekin> ah yes my french swirls
[4:06:38] <gryffinp> I like how he has one name
[4:06:40] <%Commiekin> all us french have them
[4:06:47] <critiquequartz> Paige can you ask him to check the doors at the bottom deck?
[4:07:01] <gryffinp> Chapter I was still blank
[4:07:05] <TheTunnelSn8ke> At this point, thunk will be required.
[4:07:08] <delerim001> missing chapter 1
[4:07:11] <+Mijymish> No, everyone knows you Frenchies wear stripes
[4:07:11] <televisedrevolting> @schlager087 He just shows up after the match is over. "This unknown plumber was brutally dunked."
[4:07:16] <TheTunnelSn8ke> Since you're about 1/4th of the way in.
[4:07:20] <Man_in_the_Red> Big Thinkin' required
[4:07:20] <natebud> Should try to guess what killed the Formossan lady
[4:07:22] <librettodude> You didn't label Lim's death
[4:07:30] <lessthanhuman_tv> wait so in the earlier scene people were jumping into boats and getting shot. Is that related to the second mate's treasure journey?
[4:07:44] <Man_in_the_Red> @lessthanhuman_tv they were just escaping after the kraken
[4:07:45] <FoolproofDread> (not trying to hint) you can enter the Second Mate's death
[4:07:51] <tranquilturnip> if an incomplete entry has a circle on it you can find that body
[4:07:57] <librettodude> The biggest obstacle in this game is forgetting to nail down causes or names
[4:08:08] <lessthanhuman_tv> @man_in_the_red somebody on the deck shot them?
[4:08:15] <%Onmi_Khaos> So he got shot trying to stop them kidnapping the royals
[4:08:19] <Man_in_the_Red> the order was all this mermaid nonsense, the Crab Rave, then the Kraken, then the Mutiny
[4:08:41] <Zap_Rowsdower32> Head down to the Cargo Deck, Pat
[4:08:41] <delerim001> you miss it
[4:08:45] <+TombstoneTTromboners> we have to go back marty
[4:08:51] <%CommanderSqueaks> Boats are great, aren't they guys?
[4:08:55] <lessthanhuman_tv> I see
[4:08:56] <%TheBitingIrish> Did he ever name the dude with the lady tattoo?
[4:09:03] <cipher758> sick boat
[4:09:04] <%Piemen99> the best squeakes
[4:09:06] <Amadeusguy> He did
[4:09:07] <%Onmi_Khaos> Yes
[4:09:07] <@SoFarFetched> Pat can't see the chat.
[4:09:14] <@SoFarFetched> Since people keep spoiling
[4:09:20] <+wmeldrum> chiyo chan?
[4:09:20] <%Mister_McDerp> invisible chat
[4:09:22] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[4:09:24] <%CommanderSqueaks> Mwahaha, scream your anger into the void, bastards!
[4:09:25] <critiquequartz> @thebitingirish yes
[4:09:26] <+Mijymish> I thought he turned it back on at some point?
[4:09:26] <%SuckerPunchSyd> LUL
[4:09:28] <%king_wragles> Cruises suck anyhow
[4:09:30] <+waltzqueen> Never
[4:09:32] <%Nupinoop296> hoo boy
[4:09:34] <@SoFarFetched> So Paige is looking at chat to kind of help nudge pat.
[4:09:37] <+TombstoneTTromboners> why not, this shit seems sick as hell
[4:09:40] <@SoFarFetched> and look out for spoilers
[4:09:41] <librettodude> Now comes the deductions
[4:09:48] <+Mijymish> Gotcha
[4:09:54] <lessthanhuman_tv> @sofarfetched I don't think he confirmed or denied if he closed it after modding plague
[4:09:56] <%ZE_Count> clawed works
[4:09:57] <kazadaz> Are there any empty chapters in the book?
[4:09:59] <natebud> bet its strangled
[4:10:05] <%chambatron> Clawed
[4:10:07] <tranquilturnip> Can I try and tell paige non-spoiler UI/Book tips?
[4:10:15] <natebud> called it
[4:10:18] <%SuckerPunchSyd> NICE
[4:10:20] <%TheBitingIrish> Close enough!
[4:10:20] <+Grayhammatter> strangled? that's weird
[4:10:20] <%Commiekin> Strangled, clawed, or drowned would have all worked
[4:10:21] <+Mijymish> The audio cue gives the strangling away
[4:10:22] <%CommanderSqueaks> BOO, Brute Force'
[4:10:22] <OperatorPlease> mauled or *clawed?*
[4:10:25] <+TombstoneTTromboners> PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[4:10:26] <+Reecer6> game accepts both strangled and clawed for her
[4:10:28] <%Pookiedaexzile> Strangled with teeth
[4:10:29] <librettodude> Should be noted that the game accepts "Close Enough" answers
[4:10:30] <+God_Of_Oreos> yooo obra dinn nice. love this game
[4:10:30] <%Piemen99> psaDab psaDab psaDab psaDab psaDab psaDab psaDab psaDab psaDab psaDab psaDab
[4:10:33] <%king_wragles> You guys here about King George? He was strangled by the guillotine
[4:10:35] <+Grayhammatter> nice job pat
[4:10:35] <TheTunnelSn8ke> 18/60 done
[4:10:35] <%jiin6> Brute forced it
[4:10:35] <Slimeking_Mike> Maba is New
[4:10:37] <bananagourmet> i think it accepts multiple deaths for her
[4:10:37] <%dashmatt> Killin it
[4:10:40] <%Laecerelius> Yay!
[4:10:42] <+lbCyber> a quarter of the way there
[4:10:43] <%TheDullaMAN> TheDullaMAN subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 26 months! Hey nerd, girl nerd, lesser nerds who watch greater nerds, and Elmo. It's me, that guy who says things sometimes. Just using my Prime sub to call you all nerds and ask that you call them all nerds as well, you big nerd. You're all nerdy nerd nerds.
[4:10:44] <kayamek> Paige Puzzle Godis you
[4:10:44] <seainspace> down pat
[4:10:45] <+Mijymish> The sound design is so rad.
[4:10:49] <%YakumoYomi> ÔºùMegalohydrothalassophobia activated=
[4:10:50] <delerim001> Go down
[4:10:51] <natebud> The mermaid had her hands around her neck
[4:10:54] <tranquilturnip> Paige if pat needs help finding corpses the circled unfinished entries in the book are hints on where to go
[4:10:54] <lunarcivilwar> death by self-insertion
[4:10:55] <Amadeusguy> nearly a third of the way done
[4:11:00] <@StridentSong> Can you guys seriously stop
[4:11:00] <%MidnightBurst12> cargo deck
[4:11:01] <televisedrevolting> The bastards at the Insurance Company might split hairs though.
[4:11:02] <%ZE_Count> theres a really hidden body that pat kind of noticed the hand moving to
[4:11:04] <Tisaric> there is a decent amount of leeway for some deaths which is nice
[4:11:04] <%doc_ock_rokc> cargo deck
[4:11:06] <SGrim> 30%
[4:11:08] <%Pookiedaexzile> You're f- just became an f+
[4:11:08] <librettodude> monkaS
[4:11:11] <lessthanhuman_tv> :o
[4:11:12] <Zap_Rowsdower32> They're watching...
[4:11:12] <Hellarussian> who was compass
[4:11:15] <oOZtkOo> i dont like that
[4:11:18] <%marsantas> It goes much faster when you notice patterns and start knocking out groups
[4:11:25] <natebud> You can totally solve the slapped by a shrimp guy based on dialogue alone.
[4:11:29] <+ShinBojangles> just swim to it
[4:11:38] <critiquequartz> Pagie can you ask @patstaresat to check ALL the doors down on the bottom deck
[4:11:45] <+mczarklesby> Oh, neat! I never knew that!
[4:11:45] <gryffinp> I think that chapter one is hte last one?
[4:11:47] <+duckmeat_woohoo> CARGO DECK
[4:11:49] <gryffinp> Oh no there's a few more
[4:11:51] <+duckmeat_woohoo> CAR GO BRRM BRRM
[4:11:52] <+Grayhammatter> there's tons of corpses, wow
[4:11:53] <%CommanderSqueaks> Wait he hasn't finished the FIRST chapter?
[4:11:54] <%CommanderSqueaks> XD
[4:12:00] <cipher758> sound design is amazing. art direction kind of speaks for itself, beautiful gaem
[4:12:02] <+duckmeat_woohoo> CARGO VROOM VROOM
[4:12:03] <deafmutelaughing> remember that's the chapter you can't get
[4:12:04] <kazadaz> born rotten, born rotten
[4:12:06] <%Commiekin> nonlinear storytelling
[4:12:08] <%Nupinoop296> finally
[4:12:11] <@SoFarFetched> Well the chapters seem to be jumping around.
[4:12:15] <Man_in_the_Red> @commandersqueaks gotta work backwards one corpse atta time
[4:12:15] <%king_wragles> @CommanderSqueaks None of these chapters are in order
[4:12:21] <%jiin6> Big brain go brrrrrrr
[4:12:21] <%MidnightBurst12> basement
[4:12:23] <seainspace> oh finally
[4:12:25] <%bread_assassin> Game already said you can't do the Bargain chapter.
[4:12:29] <%king_wragles> First corpse was in like, chapter 6
[4:12:29] <%Parapattern> John Madden having a field day with those maps
[4:12:32] <librettodude> The Chapters are in order, but not the way you discover them
[4:12:33] <gryffinp> The chapters are in chronological order, but the order that you get TO chapters is chaotic and in some cases nonllinear
[4:12:33] <+Grayhammatter> OH
[4:12:36] <+lbCyber> Another hint: You can check what scene a character was last seen in, which is likely their point of death
[4:12:37] <+waltzqueen> WELL
[4:12:38] <%ZE_Count> CRABBBB
[4:12:39] <Mr_Rakjo> Hellooo

[4:13:38] <thatonepassionbentgamer> WHAT A HERO
[4:13:39] <Amadeusguy> impaled from 3 different directions and he still managed to shoot it
[4:13:40] <gryffinp> that dude is doing his best to help
[4:13:43] <ginnypigz> Mysterious
[4:13:43] <%CommanderSqueaks> He stabbed it in the asshole!
[4:13:43] <terminusterminal> It is so cool watching everyone become badasses on this ship
[4:13:45] <Zap_Rowsdower32> Yes
[4:13:46] <+NoGodsNoSenpais> he's in stovokor
[4:13:47] <+lbCyber> He's a hero, that's who he is
[4:13:49] <+Loinclothiclese> @TIME_PUNCHER yes, with fishmen riding them
[4:13:50] <lessthanhuman_tv> imagining seeing that thing in motion in real life is scaring me
[4:13:50] <%MidnightBurst12> american?
[4:13:52] <@SoFarFetched> NO SOLICITORS ON THIS SHIP
[4:13:53] <%Parapattern> Nathan is smart to be behind the stairs
[4:13:54] <alexandrecau> nah no barrel
[4:14:00] <+mczarklesby> But it was COOL
[4:14:01] <%A0N33> Man, how the HELL do you even design this fucking game?
[4:14:02] <wruce__billis> Doesn;t this remind you of that one episode of Star Trek?
[4:14:06] <%SuckerPunchSyd> that guy is the coolest
[4:14:06] <+awesomeguy423> this game is better than Papers Please
[4:14:07] <%chambatron> It's amazing how this is better than tlou2
[4:14:08] <+awesomeguy423> fight me
[4:14:11] <critiquequartz> He‚Äôs the strongest
[4:14:13] <Zap_Rowsdower32> WHERE'S ME MUSKET?!
[4:14:14] <%Link232> BRAVE but unfortunate soul o7
[4:14:16] <Stoogeish> did pat find nathan by checking for brothers?
[4:14:17] <%TheBitingIrish> Especially at this hour!
[4:14:18] <%SuckerPunchSyd> coolest last words
[4:14:19] <giuseppe455> spooder
[4:14:24] <%SuckerPunchSyd> "Is that all"
[4:14:28] <%bread_assassin> I wonder why the game only marks the death of one of the crap people.
[4:14:29] <%twohitgood> now i want some boiled crab legs.
[4:14:30] <+brightman42> red herring?
[4:14:32] <%LiquidDinosaur> What like a barrel falling on them?
[4:14:32] <+lbCyber> enemy is foreign national
[4:14:32] <startstoprepeat> some stuff is red herrings
[4:14:32] <@commanderclaw> Crab battle!
[4:14:33] <%arancet> some are red herrings
[4:14:34] <%Daniel_Is_I> I think "enemy" is just "another human who isn't a crewmember" but idk
[4:14:35] <zettig> enemy = human
[4:14:36] <gryffinp> "Enemy" is human forigeners who are enemies to the crown of england.
[4:14:36] <+Mijymish> I think the mermaid can be beast or enemy
[4:14:37] <%Faustgesicht> red herring
[4:14:37] <+FatherGreyBeard> Enemy seems to be Foreign humans
[4:14:37] <+mczarklesby> Enemy is a human that is not on this boat.
[4:14:38] <%CommanderSqueaks> Foreign human
[4:14:39] <%king_wragles> @PeachSaliva Enemies would be people
[4:14:40] <%Mister_McDerp> a human
[4:14:40] <Zebekis> A human from another country
[4:14:40] <%ZE_Count> there are red herrings
[4:14:41] <%EyeFarted> HUMAN
[4:14:41] <natebud> There are many pointless entries
[4:14:42] <%toastybites> enemy refers to humans
[4:14:43] <%MidnightBurst12> humanoid
[4:14:43] <Tisaric> enemy just means "human not identifiable"
[4:14:44] <Zap_Rowsdower32> Enemies are human
[4:14:44] <gryffinp> Like pirates or spaniards or something
[4:14:45] <OperatorPlease> "Foreign enemy" = "we're at war with France"
[4:14:47] <zettig> beast = non-human
[4:14:48] <delerim001> you are right
[4:14:48] <%Link232> Enemy would be like pirate
[4:14:49] <TheTunnelSn8ke> Enemies can be a red herring option.
[4:14:50] <%Shubreaker> enemy is just "human"
[4:14:51] <Railgun5> Enemy = Human
[4:14:54] <critiquequartz> @patstaresat not everything is used
[4:14:56] <Zap_Rowsdower32> The mermaids and spider crab riders are beasts
[4:14:57] <%arancet> some causes are red herrings, just to pad out options
[4:15:03] <Amadeusguy> Not every option will be used
[4:15:05] <+Maswrath> Enemy as in rival nations
[4:15:06] <%CommanderSqueaks> WAIT IS THIS GAME GOING TO HAVE PIRATES TOO!?
[4:15:11] <%Monkeyweed21> human that isnt part of the crew
[4:15:22] <giuseppe455> @Amadeusguy shhhhh
[4:15:25] <tonfirean> the giant enemy crab
[4:15:28] <natebud> Pat missed another sneaky corpse in this room
[4:15:29] <+Mijymish> flies
[4:15:30] <+michaelsadler> if anyone who's not on the crew an enemy, would that make the player an enemy?
[4:15:33] <+brightman42> blind
[4:15:35] <kazadaz> HORN SOUND
[4:15:35] <critiquequartz> Yes!
[4:15:37] <deafmutelaughing> @CommanderSqueaks I'm sure some people played it without paying
[4:15:38] <%dashmatt> blind
[4:15:38] <Man_in_the_Red> this is insurance collection, remember, gotta account for every possible fate

[4:16:05] <+mczarklesby> It's looped around to be hilarious
[4:16:06] <seainspace> HE WAS RIGHT THERE, AGAIN
[4:16:06] <brachydios777> Taste like crab, talk like people
[4:16:06] <%Klonoa__> no hints! don't say blind!

[4:16:28] <+FatherGreyBeard> Seems like it'll be the start of another minimassacre
[4:16:31] <%CommanderSqueaks> Even the MODS are calling you blind.
[4:16:32] <Iam_Dead> what'll happen next on the WACKY misadventures of the obra dinn?
[4:16:35] <Man_in_the_Red> just wait out for the clock

[4:17:52] <%Klonoa__> now he has to commit assisted suicide!
[4:17:54] <%ringabal> His soul was weighed down by gravity

[4:17:59] <Stoogeish> oh I live the solution to who the crushed crewmen is here
[4:18:00] <The_Dudde> what is this game
[4:18:02] <%Commiekin> turns out 1800s labor was awful and risky
[4:18:02] <%rdark_ksu> barrels are the most dishonorable container
[4:18:03] <%cureneckbeard> These barrels have no honor!
[4:18:08] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Ohhh, no spoilers but I think we know who this is
[4:18:09] <+FatherGreyBeard> That guy looks like a Morrowind npc

[4:18:20] <%tolloponik> work safty psa
[4:18:22] <alexandrecau> that is a klingon death
[4:18:24] <+Grayhammatter> the start of the troubles
[4:18:25] <%arcielardor> @PatStaresAt You should be playing sea shantys in the background
[4:18:27] <Stoogeish> you can totally figure out who worf is from here
[4:18:27] <%cvp5127> lame
[4:18:28] <+snorlaxbud> Pat, above the accident site
[4:18:29] <%tolloponik> safety
[4:18:29] <%ZE_Count> stowaway in barrel died same time
[4:18:30] <librettodude> Didn't even make it out of port
[4:18:31] <SGrim> First Death is Worf LUL
[4:18:32] <+kukadin> hahaha barrels great pewdiepie joke pat
[4:18:33] <%bread_assassin> He didn't even get to die to like the kraken or crab people.
[4:18:38] <+Ominnous> died before they even left the dock
[4:18:40] <gryffinp> This game's music is too good to cover it up with actual sea shanties
[4:18:43] <%TheBitingIrish> INSIDE?
[4:18:44] <kazadaz> bit of a contrast to the guy who dies shooting a crab
[4:18:46] <+TombstoneTTromboners> this poor fucker
[4:18:48] <%SuckerPunchSyd> god thats rough
[4:18:49] <BinaryBetrayer> He got off easy, all things considered
[4:18:50] <@PeachSaliva> @kukadin huh???
[4:18:50] <televisedrevolting> So they were just fucked from the start.
[4:18:52] <%CommanderSqueaks> Wait, INSIDE?
[4:18:53] <@PlagueOfGripes> eating into mic
[4:18:55] <%Commiekin> not on the manifest? not your problem
[4:18:57] <%CommanderSqueaks> So he was INSIDE the barrel?
[4:18:58] <%ZE_Count> unknow passenger I guess
[4:19:00] <ginnypigz> ???
[4:19:00] <+Grayhammatter> oh, he fell out of it
[4:19:02] <Man_in_the_Red> LUL

[4:19:07] <kazadaz> the stowaways IN the computer
[4:19:11] <%Piemen99> ooooooh
[4:19:11] <critiquequartz> That‚Äôs why the Barrel was missing
[4:19:11] <tranquilturnip> ancient Pewdie reference
[4:19:11] <deafmutelaughing> ASMR Kappa
[4:19:12] <+Mijymish> So this is not the shell's fault, at least.
[4:19:14] <BinaryBetrayer> I'd rather die to the barrel than get decapitated by a giant enemy crab of be thunderstruck
[4:19:14] <TheTunnelSn8ke> That one is just a crewman in the wrong place at the wrong time
[4:19:16] <%MidnightBurst12> he's still in the barrel
[4:19:16] <%Chichen> CAROMCH
[4:19:17] <%cureneckbeard> abipopSNACK
[4:19:18] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> Now Pat is Paige and Paige is Pat
[4:19:20] <%doc_ock_rokc> Relax don't do it
[4:19:22] <jubejube56> and I guess the flies were supposed to hint that there was a corpse?
[4:19:24] <brachydios777> Paige literally said that
[4:19:29] <Man_in_the_Red> @jubejube56 yep
[4:19:32] <tonfirean> He succeeded at stowing away, just didn't survive the experience.
[4:19:35] <ginnypigz> OY
[4:19:35] <SomeAsianDood> so what's this guy making after this game? Cuz this and papers please were great
[4:19:38] <lessthanhuman_tv> imagine having a lame death AFTER the mermaid bullshit

[4:19:51] <terminusterminal> Everything is going wrong on this fucking ship
[4:19:52] <%dashmatt> ohhhhh
[4:19:52] <thatonepassionbentgamer> Curbed stomped by a barrell
[4:19:53] <tranquilturnip> They died within like .5 seconds of each other
[4:19:56] <seainspace> sounded german
[4:19:56] <%Faustgesicht> Killed onboard before departing: Yeah, that's a sign of cursed voyage.
[4:19:57] <Man_in_the_Red> with how dead still the ship is, any movement would be a giveaway
[4:19:57] <%Parapattern> "Ten Banana Cream Pies! WOOAH!"
[4:19:58] <%Mister_McDerp> how unfortunate
[4:19:59] <%CommanderSqueaks> THat's rough buddy
[4:19:59] <+Ancopro> thats rough buddy
[4:20:03] <professorno> 60 stooges
[4:20:03] <natebud> You should know who this is
[4:20:09] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> We know who this guy is, let's see if they remember
[4:20:10] <Voxus_Lumith> Man sailing was fuckin' rough.
[4:20:12] <%jiin6> 2 worf'd

[4:20:15] <%spiritofmojave> 60 comical ways to die
[4:20:15] <%cureneckbeard> they dropped one guy on the other guy
[4:20:17] <%ZE_Count> Remember!
[4:20:18] <%Mr_Pylon> big brain coming uo
[4:20:22] <+Mijymish> It was an accident, I swear.
[4:20:22] <BinaryBetrayer> This moment has been mentioned before, in another death
[4:20:23] <%ringabal> Remember kids, never get yourself into a barrel, Wind Waker taught me as much
[4:20:23] <brachydios777> Is everyone clumsy as hell?
[4:20:23] <%Nupinoop296> oh good he looked up
[4:20:25] <+Maswrath> Bout half a second
[4:20:26] <wruce__billis> @turbofolk what pewdiepie barrel jokes? is it the worf jokes? if pewdiepie is a trekker i might have to actually check out his stuff
[4:20:26] <+Grayhammatter> two people got worf'd
[4:20:27] <librettodude> Clear Picture means "You have enough information", not necessarily "You should know"
[4:20:30] <kazadaz> drop a stowaway on it
[4:20:30] <%Mr_Pylon> cargo sucks
[4:20:35] <cipher758> barrel mutiny
[4:20:36] <Stoogeish> is pat the big smart? let's find out
[4:20:38] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Voxus_Lumith Sailing wasn't a job you took because you were well off in life.
[4:20:44] <%spiritofmojave> CARGO HAS NO HONOR!
[4:20:55] <Firesparks> @CommanderSqueaks midshipman?
[4:20:56] <%bread_assassin> This crew is like 10% bumblefucks 90% badass warriors.
[4:20:58] <%ZE_Count> I wonder what the pay was?
[4:21:05] <librettodude> Time to solve some deaths
[4:21:06] <Stoogeish> pat is not the big smart FeelsBadMan
[4:21:06] <%arcielardor> David Cage trilogy of sadness is on sale on steam.
[4:21:08] <%PettyFunk> @bread_assassin So the inverse of this chat?
[4:21:08] <+Loinclothiclese> @brachydios777 id assume waves also dont help much
[4:21:12] <gryffinp> Yep
[4:21:15] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Firesparks Even then, most likely second or third sons of noble families who weren't going to get inheritances.
[4:21:15] <BinaryBetrayer> Time to solve the game, Pat
[4:21:15] <natebud> Before the voyage
[4:21:16] <gryffinp> that one's just a tragic accident
[4:21:17] <+brightman42> Do not leave the boat until you've filled everything out, it'll trigger the end
[4:21:18] <terminusterminal> Living in America
[4:21:19] <%Nupinoop296> shit was cursed even before the shells

[4:22:31] <%furiousfurioso> now its time to solve the thing
[4:22:32] <Railgun5> You can rewind to the point before you leave
[4:22:32] <Amadeusguy> thanks paige
[4:22:33] <tonfirean> I think the game warns you too.
[4:22:34] <delerim001> Read the book
[4:22:34] <+lbCyber> old guy will be wet and that's fine
[4:22:34] <Firesparks> good job paige
[4:22:36] <%cvp5127> good chat
[4:22:36] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> Paige saved the stream
[4:22:37] <%Klonoa__> everything but that
[4:22:38] <PartyFavors> You've officially seen every scene.
[4:22:38] <tranquilturnip> You have everything you need other than the Bargain chapter
[4:22:38] <+desfore> You can go down to the boat, and he gives you the option to get back on the SHip
[4:22:38] <gryffinp> pat needs to reread the foreward of the book
[4:22:38] <%ZE_Count> thats the last one after you solve everything
[4:22:39] <%JonathLP> WAIT
[4:22:39] <librettodude> There is one chapter that is off-limits, which will unlock at the end
[4:22:39] <%MidnightBurst12> that's later
[4:22:39] <kazadaz> (You can also leave, get the bad ending, and then go back into the game whenever to get the good ending)
[4:22:39] <BinaryBetrayer> No Lazzarette for you
[4:22:39] <%Link232> Yeah you have access to all the memories (except for the one that's specifically omitted if you check the book)
[4:22:40] <critiquequartz> No remember the letter?
[4:22:40] <SGrim> Why did you stop him chat!?
[4:22:40] <Man_in_the_Red> you need to solve all the fates to get the last chapter
[4:22:41] <+waltzqueen> Thanks, paige
[4:22:42] <+TombstoneTTromboners> well almost everything
[4:22:43] <natebud> Lazarette is only for good end
[4:22:43] <+Maswrath> Don‚Äôt leave, it‚Äôll tell you when you‚Äôve solved everything you can
[4:22:43] <Railgun5> Leave now and you get a special ending
[4:22:45] <%JonathLP> Don't leave yet
[4:22:45] <+duckmeat_woohoo> You need to discover everyone's name and fats to get the Lazarette ending
[4:22:45] <%CommanderSqueaks> Peach you are the best.
[4:22:46] <Tisaric> You've seen every scene you can I think?
[4:22:47] <startstoprepeat> remember the locked chapter?
[4:22:47] <%ringabal> Insurance heeds for no one
[4:22:47] <%Nupinoop296> hey guys did pat find the other thing? i don't wanna say it
[4:22:48] <+RyTYoung> nope
[4:22:51] <%Piemen99> wow chat did something right for once
[4:22:54] <%Klonoa__> Isn't this one huge hint?
[4:22:54] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> Pat give piage the good dick for preventing your major fuck up
[4:22:55] <%Commiekin> No you can get to the lazarette, you just don't have access to The Bargain
[4:22:58] <Thetruestblacksun> Wooooo
[4:23:03] <Thetruestblacksun> Lucky, lucky
[4:23:06] <kingra> CRAB
[4:23:07] <+Mijymish> you can't solve EVERYONE yet. but the game will tell you when you solve everyone you "can"
[4:23:07] <Zap_Rowsdower32> You want to just solve everything
[4:23:08] <+lbCyber> bad ending is just a portion of the good ending, it's not worth doing
[4:23:10] <%Commiekin> real special ending is blaming everything on the captain
[4:23:11] <worsealex> Hey Pat, just saw all your TLOU2 tweets... Eeeeeessshhh
[4:23:11] <%Nupinoop296> you can save at any point on the ship
[4:23:11] <kingra> CRAB CORPSE
[4:23:12] <Man_in_the_Red> you need to re input all the info
[4:23:15] <Railgun5> It saves your progress and rewinds to the point before you left
[4:23:15] <%Klonoa__> You can just load after
[4:23:17] <%jiin6> Yes:)
[4:23:19] <%Piemen99> he already saw it
[4:23:23] <saraizarai> I didn't know you could end it here and get a epcial ending
[4:23:24] <+wellshuckit> Key on cap corpse?
[4:23:24] <lessthanhuman_tv> is it spoilers to ask what they were guarding in Chapter 1 before they left the port?
[4:23:32] <%NekoUrabe> Paige is BIG KUSA
[4:23:33] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Lasarette is forbidden chapter you get after everything, I think it was mentioned at the start?
[4:23:33] <Iam_Dead> lazerette remains closed until after you return the completed book, the surgeon says as much in his letter to you in the beginning.
[4:23:34] <natebud> Read dialogue from slapped by shrimp man, use big brain
[4:23:34] <Voxus_Lumith> You just come back and tell your bosses "yeah shit's fucked," and leave.
[4:23:38] <PartyFavors> Check the note on The Bargain
[4:23:38] <%JonathLP> Lazarette is bonus if you solve EVERYTHING before leaving the boat
[4:23:39] <ShineTheDiamond> @PatStaresAt Are we finishing the game tonight?
[4:23:41] <%CommanderSqueaks> Will Pat's mind goblins let him leave tho!?
[4:23:46] <+Mijymish> @lessthanhuman_tv I think that was the shell.
[4:23:49] <%ZE_Count> The hammock memory is really useful

[4:24:38] <%cureneckbeard> the true obra dinn starts here
[4:24:38] <%PettyFunk> Achievement unlocked: Prologue
[4:24:39] <%CommanderSqueaks> Si
[4:24:40] <%dashmatt> Hoy!
[4:24:45] <+TombstoneTTromboners> bad ending time
[4:24:46] <%huskarl_zap> gonna go watch korone
[4:24:47] <+schlager087> Congratulations, you pressed Start
[4:24:48] <%Commiekin> you have finally completed The Second Dream
[4:24:52] <%D00msDayDan> now pick up your shotgun
[4:24:52] <%arcielardor> YOU GOT PUNKED PAT
[4:24:53] <%MidnightBurst12> some of these deaths are bullshit
[4:24:54] <%cureneckbeard> will you continue this game later
[4:24:57] <Stoogeish> how many has he done?
[4:25:05] <gryffinp> This is your "turn back and don't get the bad ending dumbass" message
[4:25:06] <%Nupinoop296> around 15?
[4:25:13] <Zap_Rowsdower32> I completed this game legit and it took me like eight hours
[4:25:13] <TheTunnelSn8ke> Tick. Tock.
[4:25:18] <%Klonoa__> love the visuals
[4:25:19] <kazadaz> This game does the Rust thing where your character's gender is randomly determined (though there's literally two voice lines)
[4:25:21] <+desfore> He got around 18
[4:25:27] <Khorneflakes_> LUL he's like, "yup, this ship was F*****"
[4:25:34] <Tisaric> oh wow I didn't know the gender was random, that's cool
[4:25:38] <+TombstoneTTromboners> crab people killed em all
[4:25:40] <tranquilturnip> Fun fact the voice of the Protag at teh beginning is randomized between a male and a female
[4:25:41] <%ringabal> "I have so many claims to file."
[4:25:41] <terminusterminal> Write that in your insurance repor: "Shit was cray. $1000."
[4:25:43] <Zap_Rowsdower32> Yup, the captain killed everyone
[4:25:44] <%PettyFunk> *Loads gun* Ship's haunted.
[4:25:44] <+greenfall> i got the insurance lady
[4:25:44] <cipher758> shit's fucked yo
[4:25:44] <%Monkeyweed21> There's a special achievement for blaming EVERY death on the Captain, called "Technically True"
[4:25:45] <%huskarl_zap> MURMAIDER MURMAIDER MURMAIDER
[4:25:45] <Zap_Rowsdower32> Case Closed
[4:25:47] <%dashmatt> This game is dope, can't believe I'm just heading about it now
[4:25:51] <SGrim> Finally summary: some assholes found a cursed shell, then demons killed everyone!
[4:25:51] <%LiquidDinosaur> @kazadaz Does it also procedurally generate your genitalia
[4:25:54] <tranquilturnip> wow I missed someone else saying that LUL
[4:25:55] <%Commiekin> Dear East India Company, ship sucked. Next time don't send a ship that doesn't suck.
[4:25:57] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Monkeyweed21 That's the best
[4:26:01] <T_Sasquatch> Is what??
[4:26:02] <critiquequartz> It took me about 6 hours and I was playing with someone who had just finished the game giving me hints
[4:26:04] <Man_in_the_Red> MONEY
[4:26:05] <@StridentSong> This is your insurance claim
[4:26:07] <@SoFarFetched> PAPERS PLEASE
[4:26:11] <%huskarl_zap> LIMBO OF THE LOST 2?
[4:26:12] <tranquilturnip> This part is 100% better if you're seeing it after fully completing the game
[4:26:14] <gryffinp> You know what, the bummer is that this sequence is super cooll when you've actually beat the game, but it's just gonna be kinda dumb with half of it uncompllete
[4:26:19] <Zebekis> "England now ruled by the Crab Empire."
[4:26:32] <%ZE_Count> these are cool
[4:26:34] <tonfirean> Read to few to see what they got
[4:26:40] <Man_in_the_Red> and the storm takes the goddamn boat back the minute you leave
[4:26:42] <%dashmatt> What about our hero Charlie???
[4:26:45] <Man_in_the_Red> thats great
[4:26:46] <%Shubreaker> a cool 45 pounds
[4:26:46] <Tisaric> I would read those when you get the real ending
[4:26:47] <librettodude> No Insurance for the bereaved NotLikeThis

[4:30:32] <critiquequartz> @patstaresat any plans to finish it on stream?
[4:30:34] <%cureneckbeard> pat will you be continuing this game in later stream
[4:30:35] <+schlager087> schlager087 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months!

[4:30:47] <%Klonoa__> the sound effect work too
[4:30:48] <%marsantas> The speedrun for the bad end is to just say the captain killed everyone

[4:31:10] <%Sol_Install> WE would LOVE TO SEE THIS STREAM
[4:31:10] <%AncelDeLambert> @PatStaresAt this game is about 9 hours long on your first try, assuming you're not just brute forcing solutions
[4:31:11] <Amadeusguy> it's unfortunate, but understandable
[4:31:11] <+TombstoneTTromboners> I ALREADY PLAYED IT, I WANNA SEE PAT DO IT
[4:31:11] <xxdj1173xx> Booooooo

[4:31:15] <%MayorRev> its good
[4:31:16] <wruce__billis> @PatStaresAt do you think you'll finish this in time to talk about it on CSB
[4:31:18] <%cureneckbeard> obra dinn speedrun world record is about 1 hour 35m any%, and people have beaten it 100 in 2 hours
[4:31:18] <+mczarklesby> I mean, I DO wanna watch him stream it, but I get if he dont' wanna.
[4:31:18] <TheTunnelSn8ke> Restream this. It's still worth it.
[4:31:19] <Slimeking_Mike> Oh yeah the rest of the game wouldn't be a good stream.
[4:31:19] <lilmac64> Overwhelming spoiler potential. I'd be cautious streaming.
[4:31:20] <%Laecerelius> Do it coward!
[4:31:20] <%Klonoa__> I think popping on for the ending and explaining some high lights would be good
[4:31:21] <AGood_Noodle> I would LOVE to see you play it more @PatStaresAt
[4:31:22] <kazadaz> There's a special bad-end cheevo where you attribute all deaths to the captain
[4:31:22] <%goose_attack_almanac> @DGenerator He didn't complete it. I think he's gotten 15?
[4:31:25] <lessthanhuman_tv> PAT YOU ROTUND BITCH PLAY THIS ON STREAM
[4:31:26] <%GingerStrawhat> I would like to hear you talk about the missing chapter eight

[4:31:53] <turbofolk> Pat you are gonna be awake at least until 5 in the morning who are we kidding here
[4:31:54] <%CommanderSqueaks> @critiquequartz YEs, PEACH you stream the rest of this
[4:31:56] <%PettyFunk> It WAS Hindi, I feel vindicated
[4:31:57] <deafmutelaughing> it's tough but it's SO rewarding
[4:31:58] <%Nupinoop296> that's what the bunks are for
[4:31:58] <%Klonoa__> You really gotta learn about boats and jobs on boats lol
[4:32:01] <Man_in_the_Red> the final chapter acts as fine glue to piece together all the disasters
[4:32:01] <%danielm427> steam
[4:32:01] <%cvp5127> pls
[4:32:03] <%Sol_Install> poll it
[4:32:05] <OperatorPlease> there are some people that can only be identified by their shirts
[4:32:06] <%CommanderSqueaks> PAT
[4:32:06] <%marsantas> Focus on groups, like the indians! What were they doing?
[4:32:07] <+NoGodsNoSenpais> pls do
[4:32:08] <%thepizzaman5> DO AN UNRELIABLE POLL
[4:32:08] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> DO IT COWARD
[4:32:09] <timblenaut> 1200 viewers is good numbers
[4:32:09] <%PhantomMiG> I would think it would be like two more sessions
[4:32:10] <natebud> continue and be big smart
[4:32:13] <%LiquidDinosaur> but he beat it
[4:32:15] <%CommanderSqueaks> Peach, if Pat is too much of a coward, can you stream it?
[4:32:17] <%LiquidDinosaur> how does he continue
[4:32:18] <terminusterminal> uh oh
[4:32:19] <%Promessa_EX> Chat would have voted to continue TLO2, fuck the viewers
[4:32:20] <%GingerStrawhat> Big detective brains

[4:32:26] <%za7az> I'd be down to see the rest of this on stream

[4:32:26] <%ShichiNoBushi> "Rewind"
[4:32:26] <reonome> please stream the true ending at least
[4:32:29] <%SuckerPunchSyd> rewind?
[4:32:31] <%PettyFunk> On one hand it would be satisfying to see Pat finish it, on the other hand this incomplete playthrough is excellent advertisement to encourage people to try it themselves.
[4:32:32] <%bread_assassin> If you're not gonna continue LOU2, ya might as well do this.
[4:32:35] <terminusterminal> Alright let's see how big your brain is
[4:32:38] <deafmutelaughing> it's rewind time
[4:32:38] <%dashmatt> ok cool

[4:32:53] <%ergulor> Please continue this it was fantastic
[4:32:55] <%Monkeyweed21> There's an achievement for blaming every death on the Captain, which is "Technically" true under loose definitions @PatStaresAt
