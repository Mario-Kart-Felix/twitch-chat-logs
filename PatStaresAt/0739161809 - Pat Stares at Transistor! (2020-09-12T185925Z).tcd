[0:16:51] <ToneBacas> cat slug
[0:16:51] <JobbedBone> you play as a slug cat
[0:16:52] <%SaiyanShoto> You’re an anime girl in my heart
[0:16:53] <$ItsRatman> You're also not a corporate mascot
[0:16:54] <JobbedBone> its weird
[0:17:01] <%TallYoda08> LUL LUL
[0:17:01] <SarahTsang> can i have an anime girl, pat
[0:17:02] <%Nordguy> rainworld is SICK
[0:17:14] <@SSaryn> My thoughts should be when is Inertial Drift
[0:17:16] <+lethallunacyx> Too much white
[0:17:18] <ergulor> Ah dune not doom
[0:17:20] <%UvBenServed> Something something spice
[0:17:21] <SirKeigan> I thought you saw it cuz the David Lynch fandom LUL
[0:17:22] <%SWFanatic> ehh
[0:17:22] <%bevyrage> Rainworld is where you run amok as a slug cat in a low res pixelated environment. It's super punishing and is even more obtuse a storyline than dark souls because it takes hours to get to any point of dialogue.
[0:17:23] <Mr_Strut> Is spice just drugs?
[0:17:25] <BoneofMalkav> The Spice Must Flow Pat!
[0:17:28] <ToneBacas> the fudge must flow
[0:17:30] <ThePimpGuin> isn't dune a hentai game tho?
[0:17:30] <%SWFanatic> ehhhhhh
[0:17:32] <filialpails> and they drink their own piss
[0:17:40] <SirKeigan> Real talk
[0:17:41] <+lethallunacyx> Spice is drugs yea
[0:17:42] <%SWFanatic> Eekum Bokum must flow
[0:17:53] <%maenos2> sting codpiece
[0:17:59] <+Loinclothiclese> @Mr_Strut yea its a drug
[0:18:01] <JobbedBone> Indigenous rights is one of the themes
[0:18:02] <SoySocks> but what a bout FEAR IS THE MINDKILLER
[0:18:03] <%CalderGaming> that's actually pretty accurate
[0:18:05] <@SSaryn> Ok but I didn't hear the word Dune a single time
[0:18:08] <cureneckbeard> doon
[0:18:14] <godspeedspacebat> and if you stop taking it you die
[0:18:16] <%brickwall35> what about the Spice Girls?
[0:18:19] <%DakotaMacDoodle> The Argent energy must flow
[0:18:24] <%Spydurman> wow . . . .
[0:18:24] <%SWFanatic> learn the lore nerd
[0:18:35] <+michingmallecho> The sleeper must awaken
[0:18:36] <cureneckbeard> I thought it was from Earthworm Jim
[0:18:44] <godspeedspacebat> dune is full of great quotes and questionable opinions on eugenics
[0:18:45] <ToneBacas> i thought the fear quote was from a general or something
[0:18:46] <SirKeigan> Are you gonna check out the Doom Eternal DLC when it comes out?

[0:40:52] <WaitHowDidIGetHere> 🍴
[0:40:57] <cyclog> @bevyrage I can't into twitter so couldn't find it. twitter looks incomprehensible to me,maybe a youtube video ?
[0:41:02] <%cvp5127> epic: oops i shot myself
[0:41:02] <KingKZ> Self-inflicted wounds.
[0:41:05] <%rumtumtugnutz> apparently the nexus war thing sucks buns
[0:41:24] <filialpails> remember, jaunt is more efficient than walking
[0:41:28] <mellorolo> defiantly indeed because its trying not to be the guitar rift for there main menu but it is..
[0:41:37] <%Broand> Clucker*
[0:41:37] <LoneFonte> imagine the shitshow when they wont be able to spend infinite money on the EGS exclusivity
[0:41:39] <DawnsRoyal> now the kids can play real games like league of legends and shin megumi tensai HahaShrugMiddle
[0:41:44] <Vashido22> im just mad dr doom is in fornite but not on mvci
[0:41:46] <%Mendin> no pat t hat's a CLUCKer
[0:41:49] <+lethallunacyx> If Fall Guys and Among Us kill Fortnite, I will start going to church again
[0:41:55] <wibbwobbler> sowwy apple uwu. can fortnite pwease get back on ios :(
[0:41:55] <cyclog> @bevyrage I dont even have a account on it,there is that too.
[0:41:57] <$joylent_blue> mellorolo the hell are you even on about lol
[0:41:58] <%donstylo> Next year we see a lot of games like Fall Guys and I can only imagen what a CoD Fall Guys would like like
[0:42:31] <%Broand> I'mm a play hardspace while listening to this
[0:42:38] <WaitHowDidIGetHere> @donstylo Eliminated for speaking Russian
[0:42:40] <Vashido22> HE'S LEARNING PogChamp
[0:42:51] <%kyh9> Cucker
[0:42:57] <%rumtumtugnutz> this whole thing with Epic challenging Google and Apple by violating their terms of service to be apps and then getting pissed when they get delighted is mind boggling
[0:43:09] <%rumtumtugnutz> delisted I mean
[0:43:15] <%kyh9> get the dogs
[0:43:16] <dukenux> get clucked
[0:43:54] <%Bailey__gaming> Hello Pat :)
[0:43:58] <%donstylo> Damn I love Transistor I should play it again.
[0:44:21] <mellorolo> @joylent_blue for transistor, the level ending guitar rift track sounds like fortnite's menu guitar sound track or at least sounds similiar
[0:44:27] <WhatzePh> Epic should just stop doing stupid shit and make another Unreal (a proper one, not some Tournament stuff)
[0:44:40] <wibbwobbler> how r u?
[0:45:04] <Vashido22> did I miss the pizza chat?
[0:45:22] <%Bailey__gaming> hope you are doing well today pat :) is Paige feeling better after the overheating on the chaos stream?
[0:45:26] <%donstylo> You can build some cool shit with this skill system.
[0:45:47] <%Saltmeisterr> i don't think pat has been to the apartment yet
[0:45:47] <StrawberryBandit> idk why but the UI in this game really turned me off
[0:45:47] <DawnsRoyal> @mellorolo actually fortnite invented all music instruments, and all composed music, so any music sounds like fornite's menu music
[0:45:48] <DKDiamantes> Oh fuck, I haven't played Transistor in forever
[0:46:14] <spacecatstreams> yeh its p gud
[0:46:20] <DKDiamantes> Its a swell game, I remember the OST was dope af
[0:46:24] <%Deano8817> my favorite supergiant game of the, like, 2 I played
[0:46:26] <WhatzePh> They do, except for Franz
[0:46:29] <LoneFonte> are you enjoying it this time pat?
[0:47:15] <%PettyFunk> I definitely found Bastion way more accessible, but I always wanted to play Transistor. I've been sitting on it for a while but never really got into it
[0:47:25] <PirateMike_> That sounds like the metal gear 5 sniper lady song
[0:47:25] <%Daniel_Is_I> Hades is my favorite mechanically but Transistor blows them all out of the water aesthetically
[0:47:37] <+Aeriqui> transistor and pyre are still my favorites
[0:47:41] <%Saltmeisterr> SourPls
[0:47:44] <+Aeriqui> pyre is so underrated
[0:47:50] <spacecatstreams> hades is so good
[0:47:50] <Vashido22> Pyre is still easily my favourite, but transistor's ost is just so amazing
[0:47:51] <StrawberryBandit> I never beat Transistor but I listen to the OST regularly
[0:47:53] <mellorolo> @dawnsroyal sassy xD
[0:48:13] <+Aeriqui> hades is also incredible
[0:48:16] <%Mendin> Hey Pat have you ever played the Shadowrun games (Dragonfall or Hong Kong, at least)? The cyberfights here always remind me of the hacking minigame from there even though they're almost completely different.
[0:48:24] <spacecatstreams> just blocks your vision
[0:48:26] <PirateMike_> A good game sound track adds so much to the experiense
[0:48:26] <+Aeriqui> bastion is my least favorite because the others are so damn strong
[0:48:27] <Daxalog> Snapshots are shooting you
[0:48:31] <%PettyFunk> Pretty much all of the Supergiant soundtracks make amazing biking music
[0:48:37] <%cvp5127> they obscure your view
[0:48:37] <PirateMike_> experience*
[0:49:05] <%ZizerX> ZizerX subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 17 months! Never did finish Transistor, great aesthetic though
[0:49:05] <StrawberryBandit> "immediately"
[0:49:06] <wibbwobbler> @aeriqui truth bombs
[0:49:26] <%Daniel_Is_I> The picture is just a blocker, they also shoot bullets
[0:49:27] <%Saltmeisterr> i kinda dislike breach as a main attack
[0:49:32] <StrawberryBandit> waiting between turns always felt kinda wkward
[0:49:38] <%CalderGaming> @Mendin he spoke highly of Dragonfall years ago on the podcast. I don't remember if he ever got around to hong kong
[0:49:44] <%Saltmeisterr> to slow and takes to much turn space
[0:49:45] <Vashido22> REMEMBER WHEN DESTINY WON BEST OST OVER THIS?
[0:49:48] <Vashido22> I remember
[0:50:14] <StrawberryBandit> wait really? wow
[0:50:16] <Daxalog> Destiny has an OST?
[0:50:35] <%PettyFunk> @Vashido22 Ah what for real? I'm gonna blame Brad Shoemaker just because.
[0:50:36] <%Saltmeisterr> destiny won an award?
[0:50:40] <%Daniel_Is_I> Your first mistake was expecting game awards to be anything other than a popularity contest
[0:50:44] <%DEETRz> DEETRz subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 26 months, currently on a 26 month streak! 
[0:51:00] <WhatzePh> @Vashido22 Does Destiny have a typical sci-fi blockbuster ambient epic trash as a soundtrack?
[0:51:03] <%SirGO0SE> remember when awards weren't paid for? (can't)
[0:51:20] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> this combat system still holds up great
[0:51:22] <%Daniel_Is_I> Get and Ping
[0:51:23] <Vashido22> I just remember feeling super disappointed when it happened
[0:51:24] <lol_red_ranger> get ping
[0:51:28] <lol_red_ranger> you want ping
[0:51:29] <Blank9> ping rules
[0:51:30] <Vashido22> @WhatzePh basically
[0:51:31] <%Saltmeisterr> ping is a good sub slot
[0:51:33] <StrawberryBandit> ping get
[0:51:33] <user_naim> I just started Bastion, but in every way that it differs from Transistor, I prefer Transistor.
[0:51:39] <Daxalog> Ping is fun
[0:52:01] <StrawberryBandit> @user_naim agreed, but bastion is still good
[0:52:05] <%kyh9> Gentrified?
[0:52:07] <%Daniel_Is_I> Cool, but also YOU'RE THE WALL
[0:52:10] <ToneBacas> futuristic. i like it
[0:52:11] <OvaltineDream> o r d e r
[0:52:11] <@SSaryn> It's pretty nice all things considered.
[0:52:15] <%Saltmeisterr> get() is really good if you have something like void
[0:52:15] <%kyh9> Reminds me of Williamsburg in Brooklyn
[0:52:16] <StrawberryBandit> translation: stop LUL
[0:52:17] <Vashido22> SICK
[0:52:19] <%cvp5127> sterile and white?
[0:52:28] <%PettyFunk> There's no moisture here AT ALL
[0:52:33] <user_naim> @strawberrybandit Hopefully it grabs me when continue
[0:52:33] <%Daniel_Is_I> They're also making you into a brick. Then again Pat wouldn't mind that.
[0:52:34] <StrawberryBandit> make us whole isaac
[0:52:36] <%SirGO0SE> looks better than america r/n
[0:52:43] <+l3sovikk> Its Pat's ideal society
[0:52:43] <Vashido22> Chat, did I miss the pizza moment?
[0:52:44] <StrawberryBandit> @user_naim fingers crossed
[0:52:50] <StrawberryBandit> @Daniel_Is_I immortality??
[0:52:59] <%Mendin> I'm waiting for Adam Automata to walk out and monologue about humanity to you
[0:53:00] <%DappercatEsquire> The Process feels like something Pat would welcome
[0:53:37] <%Bailey__gaming> Hey Paige! Feelin better after the overheat?
[0:53:42] <+Loinclothiclese> @DappercatEsquire as long as pat gets to be an aware toilet hes happy
[0:53:42] <%Daniel_Is_I> Pat: "PROCESS ME! SET ME FREE!"
[0:53:54] <%AncelDeLambert> I'm late, is the Paige there?
[0:53:59] <%AncelDeLambert> Is Broken Peach present?
[0:53:59] <snakemuho> designation: Weed CiGrip
[0:54:03] <%AncelDeLambert> and does she have a robot arm?
[0:54:06] <+Plus_On_Black> it would be dope as Red levels she start to handle the sword differently, like she's start to carry it like an damn Cloud Strife.
[0:54:11] <StrawberryBandit> Help() is one of my favs
[0:54:24] <spacecatstreams> pingus
[0:54:27] <%PettyFunk> @Loinclothiclese I like how originally the toilet was the term he had to accept to achieve immortality, but now we've shifted into the toilet being the goal itself
[0:54:43] <%SirGO0SE> ping go bratatatatatat
[0:54:53] <+Loinclothiclese> @PettyFunk i mean its the natural course of things for pat LUL
[0:54:53] <wibbwobbler> p e a c h i s c o o l
[0:55:01] <StrawberryBandit> bang bang
[0:55:01] <%Saltmeisterr> GUN
[0:55:12] <Vashido22> GUN
[0:55:22] <blitzmentalist> hehe Ping goes brrrrrrrr
[0:55:28] <snakemuho> @Plus_On_Black her animation is made up of 2D sprites pre-rendered from a 3D model, it'd be A LOT of work making her have variations like that
[0:55:33] <%Saltmeisterr> It kinda sucks during turn
[0:55:39] <+Loinclothiclese> Losing?
[0:55:51] <%SirGO0SE> @Saltmeisterr not if you attach a debuff to it
[0:55:57] <%SirGO0SE> bc its turn cost is very low
[0:56:10] <%SirGO0SE> so you can slap debuffs on everyone during turn
[0:56:14] <SaltyAzteca> Gateless Kreygasm
[0:56:21] <Vashido22> SourPls
[0:56:22] <filialpails> ELEVATOR STAGE
[0:56:25] <+Xelig> is this your first time through transistor?
[0:56:35] <+Plus_On_Black> @snakemuho Facts, it would have been ill tho.
[0:56:49] <%Saltmeisterr> @SirGO0SE i haven't thought of that, but i honestly like Void for that way more
[0:56:52] <SaltyAzteca> Your Jaunt has charm, use it
[0:57:13] <%Saltmeisterr> Void with Crash and Get is Kreygasm
[0:57:15] <%SirGO0SE> @Saltmeisterr thats the cool thing about this game imo :)
[0:57:32] <Oleai> Kill 'em all in one hit
[0:57:33] <Bob8644> Hey, Pat, what do you think of dog owners who try to justify leaving their dog off a leash?
[0:57:37] <%miguelrod777> I've become a simp to the tentacult
[0:57:40] <%Saltmeisterr> yeah man
[0:57:47] <RajidaViper> Oh sweet! I love this game.
[0:57:52] <+pectusumbra> alright, there is a reprieve
[0:57:56] <filialpails> use different functions to combo
[0:58:03] <lol_red_ranger> snapshot blocks your screen and if you get close they do damage in a burst
[0:58:03] <snakemuho> they just shoot at you and hide the screen if they hit
[0:58:14] <Daxalog> Snapshots literally just shoot you. They sometimes flash an image thats it
[0:58:27] <%YakumoYomi> I have returned from the land of anime streamers. Is Pat doing a good job？
[0:58:31] <stormhawk9891> They just obscure your screen
[0:59:03] <RajidaViper> Yeah, crash is good
[0:59:18] <%Mendin> I don't remember this game's pace but I don't want to spoil accidentally, how long until T.S.o.t.W. shows up?
[0:59:18] <%tanarath> he's surviving
[0:59:19] <OvaltineDream> phew
[0:59:32] <snakemuho> Crash can perma stun with right setups
[0:59:36] <wibbwobbler> bruh
[1:00:04] <lol_red_ranger> he's like 30 min away from TSOTW probably, maybe
[1:00:06] <user_naim> is this the 0451?
[1:00:09] <%Saltmeisterr> @Mendin till what shows up?
[1:00:11] <OvaltineDream> Camarilla LUL
[1:00:15] <%Saltmeisterr> oh
[1:00:18] <%Saltmeisterr> no i know
[1:00:20] <SaltyAzteca> Heightmap Kreygasm
[1:00:24] <%Mendin> ok that long? Got it, coo
[1:00:25] <%Saltmeisterr> now*
[1:00:25] <Vashido22> they sure are
[1:00:44] <+pectusumbra> I mean they are called the Camarata and dress like fascists
[1:01:01] <%Saltmeisterr> mask with crash is hella tight
[1:01:11] <+Tomschiii> they are dressed with fashion
[1:01:21] <+vaultzombie> Mask on? Fuck it, mask off.
[1:01:31] <%ShootThatZombie> I MADE IT, I'M HERE. Did I miss anything?
[1:01:51] <+lordericter> BAD DOG
[1:01:55] <%SirGO0SE> hit with debuff first
[1:01:55] <%Saltmeisterr> oh god these guy
[1:02:02] <%Saltmeisterr> these dogs suck
[1:02:04] <%SirGO0SE> perfect

[1:02:44] <SaltyAzteca> Da weeeeds
[1:02:48] <Vashido22> hey man want some WEED 2.0?
[1:02:56] <snakemuho> Fetches are Dark Souls tier of bad doggos
[1:03:20] <+lordericter> too far
[1:03:39] <SaltyAzteca> @PatStaresAt If you hate when they get pushed, you can use Get next time you level
[1:03:47] <%byuniart> pat use the bombs
[1:04:25] <snakemuho> it doesn't move because you can't see it anymore Kappa
[1:04:31] <critfumble_> aah man i missed the start, oh well off to the vod, have fun pat!
[1:04:40] <%Valdorick> Getting stabbed in the chest tends to do that... make one super dead.
[1:04:41] <critfumble_> can't wait to see the end
[1:04:50] <%Saltmeisterr> oh
[1:04:52] <filialpails> remember to remove limiter
[1:04:58] <BlueLunecy> You literally ripped the sword outta him
[1:05:11] <%Saltmeisterr> yeah crash with get seems very good
[1:05:20] <%Saltmeisterr> and with the other melee function
[1:05:31] <%Saltmeisterr> whats it called again?

[1:15:43] <RajidaViper> Woolie seemed more excited to talk about Frank Miller's Batman
[1:15:44] <%weissguard> Woolie also danced around the fact that he thought the Shazam movie sucked.
[1:15:44] <penitentpentwitch> Jaunt() + Ally() = You leave a clone wherever you dash from. Great when you have a lot of Mem to use
[1:15:45] <%CalderGaming> @PatStaresAt I recommend listening to the podcast Mobile Suit Breakdown as a companion to Zeta if you rewatch from the beginning
[1:15:47] <%thewhiterice92> He’s gonna talk about Watchmen because now he knows

[1:25:24] <PanicSwytch> Dead Space and Bioshock infinite did the track line great
[1:25:24] <Dragon_Batman> I think it's good for some games, it was perfect for dead space tho
[1:25:28] <penitentpentwitch> Test your skills~
[1:25:39] <penitentpentwitch> You gain Mem per round

[1:27:17] <+lordericter> tripple creep is a rough one
[1:27:17] <PatchySouls> @snakemuho Spark() with the Mask() upgrade really helped me out there
[1:27:20] <%SirGO0SE> big damblage
[1:27:28] <%Saltmeisterr> cuz void and tap*
[1:27:49] <steff_mcbee> Looking at this map layout is triggering something deep in my brain, I think I had lots of issues with this one first playthrough haha
[1:27:50] <snakemuho> I got soft locked a couple of times thanks to Switch

[1:31:25] <Blank9> I'm free, free ballin'
[1:31:27] <penitentpentwitch> Yes, but that also doubles as 'freeballing' aka 'getting exposed'
[1:31:28] <Dragon_Batman> More like orbing
[1:31:29] <BoneofMalkav> We need Chad Warden to confirm if you are ABAP to be Ballin

[1:32:04] <@SSaryn> At least you ain't seeing Chris Evans nudes
[1:32:07] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> You're min-maxing future limiters
[1:32:10] <filialpails> keep using limiters until it becomes a round number again
[1:32:15] <bigunclebungus> have u tried liking it?
[1:32:17] <SaltyAzteca> If you had used limiters youd have been a level further already Kappa
[1:32:20] <%Spydurman> Limiters are for New Game Plus in my opinion
[1:32:24] <Dragon_Batman> Why you seeing Chris Evan nudes?
[1:32:29] <Ipsenscastle> at least it's not like 92.3 or something

[1:33:13] <%Saltmeisterr> use ping to detonate packets pat
[1:33:15] <penitentpentwitch> Load() creates an explosive at the location you attack to create a massive explosion. It's a finicky ability.
[1:33:26] <%byuniart> No!
[1:33:40] <PanicSwytch> People were talking about chris evans penis for like 20 mins in Woolie's stream
[1:33:47] <%SWFanatic> Pat: "Reading is for nerds." Later Pat: "I was confused."
[1:33:59] <%Saltmeisterr> u can also use ping on cooldown
[1:34:05] <snakemuho> Packet gets range and Ping you can use during cooldown @PatStaresAt
[1:34:12] <%Th3SmartAlec> @PanicSwytch "That's America's penis."
[1:34:16] <penitentpentwitch> Load() then Ping() then switch targets

[1:45:43] <%Daniel_Is_I> He will snap her legs like twigs
[1:45:43] <PanicSwytch> He gonna crush your legs
[1:45:43] <Dragon_Batman> When he grows older he'll probably crush her
[1:45:46] <penitentpentwitch> NW then east of the save point

[1:45:59] <penitentpentwitch> *NE
[1:46:04] <$liger_zero_jager> I just picked up hades like, 2 days ago, I feel bad for sleeping on supergiant up to now
[1:46:12] <chambatron> Is pat gonna finish the game today or maybe in 1 or 2 more streams?
[1:46:33] <+Tomschiii> @liger_zero_jager better late than never. how aout the other games?
[1:46:33] <%SirGO0SE> @liger_zero_jager dont feel bad, youre lucky to be experiencing all of them for the first time
[1:46:34] <%velemi> yes
[1:46:37] <Dragon_Batman> I wouldn't be surprised if it was 1 more
[1:46:38] <%SWFanatic> yeah
[1:46:38] <artificiallynatural> pyre's kinda long
[1:46:40] <%Valdorick> It is
[1:46:41] <%SirGO0SE> dude pyre is so fucking good
[1:46:41] <Vashido22> yes
[1:46:42] <%twoto858> Pretty long
[1:46:42] <%Daniel_Is_I> It varies, but yes
[1:46:43] <Gutsandlove> yes
[1:46:45] <Ipsenscastle> Honestly I was disappointed when they first announced Hades was a roguelike, but now I think it's their best work
[1:46:46] <%za7az> OH YEAH
[1:46:46] <%arancet> maybe longer, cause more text to read
[1:46:47] <+AzureGale> Depends on how many endings you want to get
[1:46:50] <Vashido22> its by far the longest
[1:46:50] <%Valdorick> More VN stuff, and the matches can be long
[1:46:52] <%Arweynn> no idea I bounced off pyre super hard
[1:46:56] <artificiallynatural> but it's mostly dialogue
[1:46:56] <%za7az> Looooooong
[1:46:56] <tattleworm> it speeds up as you go
[1:46:58] <+ALazo> Play multiple seasons of pyre sports ball
[1:46:58] <%AncelDeLambert> isn't it longer because of the game type?
[1:46:58] <Ipsenscastle> Pyre's three streams at least
[1:47:03] <%bread_assassin> Pyre bonked out for me at the end, but I really liked it.
[1:47:04] <Vashido22> @patstaresat there's WAY more text
[1:47:04] <$liger_zero_jager> I probably shoulda picked up the bundle
[1:47:05] <RajidaViper> Pyre is a lot of fun.
[1:47:05] <+BloodyBurney> Longer and more replayable
[1:47:16] <Dragon_Batman> I've been wanting to play that so I'm interested in him streamin it
[1:47:22] <+Tomschiii> pyre is fricking long
[1:47:22] <Tisaric> SourPls
[1:47:23] <Vashido22> SourPls
[1:47:24] <SaltyAzteca> Notify him in HEEEELLL
[1:47:27] <%SWFanatic> HLTB Pyre: 11ish hrs
[1:47:31] <+oda_flobunaga> Pyre felt too long to me, something was up with the pacing
[1:47:42] <artificiallynatural> took me four hours to get through the first rite
[1:47:43] <+Negator7> Love Transistor
[1:47:47] <Tisaric> Pyre definitely had a bit of odd pacing
[1:47:49] <+Tomschiii> but it has best design, best music, right behind transistor and sweet characters
[1:48:06] <$liger_zero_jager> hades is actually the first game I picked up when I finished building my first pc.
[1:48:19] <Vashido22> I guess it depends, Pyre never felt like it dragged for me. I enjoyes the pacing
[1:48:30] <Sotetsu> Is this the inside of the Ark? fmgPRAMS
[1:48:40] <+oda_flobunaga> Pyre definitely has the deepest mechanics of the three but Transistor is my fave
[1:49:03] <$liger_zero_jager> pyres heavy on reading, isnt it?
[1:49:03] <%Arweynn> I got through the first Rite and a half and quit, I really didn't like the delete-your-favorites-and-keep-people-you-hate aspect
[1:49:06] <%Valdorick> He's fucking WASTED
[1:49:09] <SaltyAzteca> he is soooooooooo drunk
[1:49:17] <Tisaric> Pyre's like half VN yeah
[1:49:20] <penitentpentwitch> Silent Hill moving in
[1:49:23] <snakemuho> Pyre is a VN with some sports
[1:49:27] <+Tomschiii> pyre seems like very easy but when you experience the god difficulty, you realise how you can use the mechanics
[1:49:30] <heartlesshealer> just some crazy fog
[1:49:32] <%za7az> HMM
[1:49:34] <+Tomschiii> some are still busted
[1:49:38] <PatchySouls> he got drunk right when that weird monster creature showed up
[1:49:41] <%kysath> kysath subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! Hey Pat, nice to see you playing Transistor, very good video game. I've been playing playing your Control streams in the background while working on college stuff, and was wondering if you might do other Remedy games in the future?
[1:49:43] <PatchySouls> speaking of
[1:49:48] <RajidaViper> Of the 3 I've played (Bastion, Transistor, and Pyre), Transistor is the one I loved the most and Bastion the least.
[1:49:59] <SaltyAzteca> Rucks! is that you!
[1:49:59] <%Arweynn> also the upgrade/mastery tests sucked ass super bad. the Imp's almost made me quit right there
[1:50:01] <emeraldskrull> full on yikes, pat
[1:50:02] <Blank9> pyre is my least favorite, it's just too boring to me
[1:50:05] <Blank9> not enough game
[1:50:10] <Ipsenscastle> No you were right first time it's a giant detective
[1:50:15] <+Tomschiii> @Arweynn well, just think what your character would do, not whom you like
[1:50:19] <+oda_flobunaga> T>P>B
[1:50:25] <StencilOST> is this spine?
[1:50:27] <$liger_zero_jager> pigs and dogs are different
[1:50:32] <%Mendin> Time for dat boy?
[1:50:32] <Tisaric> the mastery tests in basically every game are like some of my favorite mechanics
[1:50:41] <Dragon_Batman> I think it will be spine
[1:50:43] <+Tomschiii> P>B>T
[1:50:55] <Tisaric> yes this is the spine
[1:50:58] <Vashido22> P>T>B for me
[1:51:06] <heartlesshealer> forget
[1:51:11] <user_naim> 0451
[1:51:15] <SaltyAzteca> Yup
[1:51:18] <+AzureGale> 0451
[1:51:25] <heartlesshealer> yup
[1:51:28] <+AzureGale> Is that a Deus Ex reference
[1:51:30] <%velemi> YEP
[1:51:31] <+Tomschiii> with a dfferent combat and loop in transistor, i would rate it higher
[1:51:32] <heartlesshealer> LUL
[1:51:38] <Tisaric> System Shock
[1:51:40] <Tisaric> not Deus Ex
[1:51:41] <RajidaViper> I still need to get the rest of Pyre's endings. I've only played once through.
[1:51:41] <OvaltineDream> nerds
[1:51:42] <Camail> yes the fight gazebo
[1:51:46] <heartlesshealer> spine of the world
[1:51:49] <reonome> oh shit its the spine
[1:51:50] <+AzureGale> You must face the Gazebo alone
[1:51:51] <Tisaric> though Deus Ex also references
[1:51:53] <heartlesshealer> SingsNote
[1:51:53] <$liger_zero_jager> I actually have no Idea what transistor is or what its about, so this is strange.
[1:51:53] <+oda_flobunaga> Cast Fireball at the Gazebo pls
[1:51:57] <Parapattern> Those symptoms are just Paige's existence
[1:51:59] <%Aeoneth> what's the significance of 0451
[1:52:01] <SaltyAzteca> RUN
[1:52:02] <RajidaViper> RUN
[1:52:02] <%Saltmeisterr> SourPls
[1:52:11] <SaltyAzteca> JAUNT YOU MAD MAN
[1:52:18] <Tisaric> @Aeoneth the first code you find in System Shock 1
[1:52:27] <penitentpentwitch> Just the tip
[1:52:30] <filialpails> queen anne has grown
[1:52:31] <Dragon_Batman> Be nice to Gief
[1:52:35] <snakemuho> @Aeoneth 451 Fahrenheit reference
[1:53:16] <heartlesshealer> baby dog flop <3

Been watching since the first machinima days, and your stuff helped me get through high school and college. Feels weird to be a working adult now but happy to see you're still sticking around
[1:53:33] <Vashido22> @PatStaresAt was the second Bastion vod deleted?
[1:53:49] <heartlesshealer> damn
[1:53:50] <%FutaSnek> psaDogchamp
[1:54:00] <Vashido22> oh
[1:54:03] <Tisaric> Get() is super fun
[1:54:04] <heartlesshealer> it was too hip to fuck bees
[1:54:07] <%Saltmeisterr> get is good on crash
[1:54:17] <StripesUltimateEdition> @snakemuho is it not a callback to 0451 from system shock?
[1:54:23] <OneThousandTomatoes> what did Paige think?
[1:54:28] <penitentpentwitch> Get() is great as a passive, but a bit iffy as an active or an upgrade
[1:54:32] <Ipsenscastle> was that the stream where it was hip to fuck bees?
[1:54:41] <heartlesshealer> yeah
[1:55:07] <Ipsenscastle> @StripesUltimateEdition yeah but in system shock it was a reference to ray bradbury
[1:55:21] <Dragon_Batman> He shake
[1:55:22] <Camail> yea the way they encourage experimentation with lore is just... so smart
[1:55:28] <$liger_zero_jager> haha, weed 2.0
[1:55:29] <Tisaric> (also the key to get into the studio)
[1:55:46] <heartlesshealer> SingsNote SingsNote SingsNote
[1:55:52] <user_naim> I thought 0451 was actually just some office number, and the Bradbury angle was an accident
[1:56:05] <$liger_zero_jager> is this turn based?
[1:56:10] <user_naim> In any case, it’s a Bradbury reference now
[1:56:16] <Tisaric> yeah it was just a happy accident from what I read
[1:56:33] <+AzureGale> lol
[1:56:33] <heartlesshealer> Mmmm difficulty
[1:56:37] <Tisaric> @liger_zero_jager not really turn based but you can pause and plan a set of moves
[1:57:27] <$liger_zero_jager> @tisaric is it like ff7r?
[1:57:30] <%AzureGale> psaGiefrail psaGiefrail psaGiefrail psaGiefrail psaGiefrail
[1:57:44] <penitentpentwitch> Layin' a trap for Sherlock Holmes
[1:57:47] <%Aeoneth> He's a loose cannon
[1:58:25] <%kysath> Everyone knows archivists are the real heroes
[1:58:28] <Tisaric> @liger_zero_jager I guess kind of? It's more like you get a resource that is timeline when planning and you can fit as many moves as you want that fit in it
[1:58:30] <user_naim> A quarter you just moved through, funny enough
[1:58:30] <+TryJake> This is such a cool system for combat
[1:58:35] <Gallhint> cronch
[1:58:50] <heartlesshealer> nice
[1:58:54] <Tisaric> @liger_zero_jager and then based on how much of that timeline you use the cooldown for it is longer/shorter so you can do it again sooner
[1:58:56] <chhdez> gitHim()
[1:59:18] <$liger_zero_jager> sounds like a more active othercide
[1:59:40] <Tisaric> yeah othercide had a bit of the same mechanics
[1:59:42] <chhdez> Are Paiges knees/ankles crunching
[1:59:52] <Dragon_Batman> I love this one

[2:21:12] <Dragon_Batman> Wishful thinking is all he got
[2:21:14] <Tisaric> sucks that jaunt got fucked
[2:21:50] <heartlesshealer> They ate her because she knew about history
[2:22:01] <+Jaysky> I used jaunt as a sub Effect most of my game
[2:22:04] <penitentpentwitch> Diet mode is go
[2:22:12] <Dragon_Batman> Oooo yea that one blows
[2:22:15] <Tisaric> oh yeah Cull() is insane
[2:22:19] <heartlesshealer> Cull
[2:22:22] <penitentpentwitch> Super uppercut
[2:22:22] <%Daniel_Is_I> Heavy hit
[2:22:23] <0mnis_edge> Cull with get best combo.

[2:22:40] <OvaltineDream> Big number
[2:22:43] <%Aeoneth> Crash Cull, was my favorite 1 -2 combo attack
[2:22:43] <%SirGO0SE> cull changes everything
[2:22:43] <+xemnahort> Big fucky wucky indeed
[2:22:45] <heartlesshealer> upward impact removed
[2:22:45] <+SpookyCookieMonster> big damage for big boys
[2:22:49] <Tisaric> BIG number
[2:22:51] <LoneFonte> biggest number
[2:22:56] <chhdez> Big number in his hip ♪
[2:22:58] <Dragon_Batman> The effect probably
[2:23:07] <penitentpentwitch> Unfortunately unlocking Cull() lore is demanding due to its load
[2:23:15] <+oda_flobunaga> yeah, but upward impact does damage when the targets land
[2:23:33] <%Saltmeisterr> cull with get is really good
[2:23:34] <%SirGO0SE> it good to knock up then pull in

[2:27:27] <heartlesshealer> one turn
[2:27:39] <heartlesshealer> good job
[2:27:48] <$RealThiele> Olly North'ed the whole shebang
[2:27:55] <Tisaric> the planning tests are so cool
[2:28:16] <lol_red_ranger> chat real quick I'm gonna fart do I record it and send it to my ex hurry I'm running out of time
[2:28:23] <heartlesshealer> S P E E D
[2:28:33] <Dragon_Batman> NAh it's yours ranger
[2:28:36] <$RealThiele> do not contact ex with ass
[2:28:39] <%DappercatEsquire> @PatStaresAt what'd you think of the accidental free upgrade to Control 505 said was impossible?
[2:28:41] <ergulor> S P E E N
[2:28:49] <penitentpentwitch> Dot + Debuff test
[2:28:51] <+SpookyCookieMonster> do not contact ex, period
[2:28:53] <0mnis_edge> My fav move.
[2:28:53] <PatchySouls> @penitentpentwitch Isn't Grant Kendrall the admin? If you're talking about Royce Bracket, he was on there too
[2:28:55] <%Saltmeisterr> VOID
[2:28:56] <T_Sasquatch> @lol_red_ranger why do you stlll have her contact LUL
[2:28:57] <user_naim> @lol_red_ranger jerk off, then send it
[2:29:11] <%Saltmeisterr> void is so good
[2:29:12] <%SirGO0SE> more dots
[2:29:15] <NoireRequiem> one of my minis just snapped
[2:29:18] <$RealThiele> good dog
[2:29:21] <lol_red_ranger> its over, its too late, fart sent
[2:29:26] <heartlesshealer> Yeah, this one is trap lines and DoTs
[2:29:37] <%ElkRiverDog> !uptime
[2:29:38] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 29m.
[2:29:41] <+SH1NK1R0> Or better yet. The excuse 505 gave when they took it back
[2:29:59] <%Saltmeisterr> @PatStaresAt stack 3 voids then purges
[2:30:00] <+SpookyCookieMonster> it's a purge it slows them too
[2:30:07] <$RealThiele> 505 "well you see we found out we CAN do it, but want to sell it as DLC"
[2:30:27] <T_Sasquatch> Tfw you jerk off but post nut clarity still makes you want to talk to your ex NotLikeThis lacStare lacStrong
[2:30:27] <%twoto858> I think I never finished this particular test
[2:30:32] <heartlesshealer> well now you can do it better
[2:30:56] <Ipsenscastle> 505 just shouldnt have offered the free upgrade at all, it was a dumbass move
[2:31:02] <0mnis_edge> void stacks 3 times.
[2:31:12] <%Evil_Emu147> Evil_Emu147 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months, currently on a 4 month streak! Keep on being my favorite stream goblin. Also, I'm happy to report my shih tzu recovered from her surgery!
[2:31:18] <%Saltmeisterr> void stacks multiple times pat
[2:31:37] <Tisaric> void does
[2:31:39] <%Saltmeisterr> yes it does pat
[2:31:40] <Tisaric> not purge
[2:31:40] <+SpookyCookieMonster> the one that said so was purge
[2:31:44] <Dragon_Batman> You don't know what your doing and that is ok
[2:31:48] <Ipsenscastle> I can legit see their difficulty because for example physical owners cant verify their purchase on the discless ps5, etc, but they just shouldnt have opened the can of worms in the first place
[2:31:49] <penitentpentwitch> @PatchySouls Your right. I forgot he doesn't mention himself since it's a formal admission and would be redundant.
[2:31:56] <+ZE_Count> So is Transistor good?
[2:32:02] <%Arweynn> CRAZZZZY TALLLLKO
[2:32:15] <user_naim> Was Cull + Void any good? That might have one of my go to’s when i played this
[2:32:16] <$RealThiele> BALLS SLIPPIN
[2:32:22] <LoneFonte> much better
[2:32:23] <%Daniel_Is_I> Transistor is great.
[2:32:24] <%Solid_Stro> psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead
[2:32:26] <penitentpentwitch> Void does no damage by itself, so little point in spam
[2:32:27] <T_Sasquatch> @ze_count great , if you enjoy strategy , art and baller music
[2:32:28] <Dragon_Batman> I think it's really good personally count, one of my favorites
[2:33:11] <Tisaric> Oh I love that they get smol
[2:33:17] <penitentpentwitch> They've been upgraded to puppies
[2:33:35] <%Aleate> There goes Paige honking her boobs again Kappa
[2:33:38] <lol_red_ranger> do I hear paige's squeaky ankles in the background
[2:33:44] <lol_red_ranger> classic squeak ankles dude
[2:33:49] <T_Sasquatch> H O N K
[2:34:04] <penitentpentwitch> More Dots!
[2:34:16] <LoneFonte> you can also use Purge to just slow them down, since you dont have Jaunt
[2:34:19] <Tisaric> MORE DOTS
[2:34:19] <$RealThiele> mother clucker
[2:34:22] <lol_red_ranger> come on more dots
[2:34:38] <$RealThiele> LUL
[2:34:44] <lol_red_ranger> thats a 50 dkp minus
[2:34:46] <Dragon_Batman> So close
[2:34:52] <penitentpentwitch> Close, at least
[2:34:57] <Tisaric> yeah this one is a bit of a pain
[2:35:08] <Tisaric> use your pause as often as you can
[2:35:09] <penitentpentwitch> Void until maximum debuff then DoT as much as you can
[2:35:09] <$RealThiele> more dots
[2:35:12] <Daxalog> Purge is leaving a damage line of damage
[2:35:15] <ToneBacas> do Paige's ankles do that squeak every time she stands up?
[2:35:20] <%Saltmeisterr> the trick is to group em up then void the purge
[2:35:35] <Vyskus> hi pat
[2:35:46] <Daxalog> Where the hell is Purge used in programming? Is it a GIT thing?
[2:35:54] <%Calenrow> Calenrow subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months! beep boop we're robots
[2:36:05] <Tisaric> function names aren't static
[2:36:10] <Tisaric> so Purge could literally mean anything
[2:36:14] <penitentpentwitch> This is one of the tougher challenges
[2:36:54] <$RealThiele> thats what we say all the time
[2:37:10] <user_naim> Man I should include a method called Purge() in something, so that it doesnt actually do anything, but gets called all the time
[2:37:54] <+SpookyCookieMonster> you ddidn't purge aaaaaaaaaaaaa
[2:37:59] <heartlesshealer> He moved in that split second between program start and aiming at him
[2:38:32] <Daxalog> The fetches should be priority 1
[2:39:04] <%valriot> LUL
[2:39:06] <heartlesshealer> on the final one....
[2:39:06] <%AzureGale> F
[2:39:08] <BoneofMalkav> It's never ogre Pat LUL
[2:39:10] <Tisaric> you're wasting time not pausing to move around
[2:39:15] <Garry_Guyface> explodes on the last frame
[2:39:29] <+BloodyBurney> turn should be used on cooldown it seems
[2:39:47] <Tisaric> yes Turn() on cooldown almost always in the speed test
[2:40:50] <%ElkRiverDog> psaBig psaDogchamp
[2:41:09] <$RealThiele> LUL
[2:41:48] <LoneFonte> you did it!
[2:41:52] <%Saltmeisterr> clap
[2:41:53] <Dragon_Batman> Noice
[2:41:59] <%AzureGale> "short and sweet" lol
[2:41:59] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> that was... ruff?
[2:42:01] <%twoto858> Aw yeah!
[2:42:03] <@Moobot> I don't know if I can trust that. (@penitentpentwitch) (warning)
[2:42:06] <heartlesshealer> clap
[2:42:07] <RajidaViper> \o/
[2:42:14] <%FutaSnek> Dude I just got a board in 1+2 that has a bear in a luchador mask ITS FUCKING AMAZING
[2:42:21] <$RealThiele> please clap
[2:42:32] <%FutaSnek> clapclapclap
[2:42:33] <penitentpentwitch> Huh. That wasn't a link? Or at least it wasn't intended.
[2:42:58] <$RealThiele> if you add DOT between stuff twitch tries to auto link it
[2:42:59] <heartlesshealer> probably no space after the .
[2:43:01] <%FutaSnek> Sometimes a . between words can make it a link
[2:43:09] <Dragon_Batman> Was there an accidental period?
[2:43:22] <%FutaSnek> musta been
[2:43:30] <penitentpentwitch> But to reiterate, that test is good at teaching that debuffs stack and work with dot application. I assume that was deleted because of bad period placement.
[2:43:46] <penitentpentwitch> The woes of fat fingering
[2:44:38] <$RealThiele> music reminds me of the Maya in rogue legacy
[2:45:52] <penitentpentwitch> Reminder: You can walk through enemies during your Turn to save time
[2:46:35] <penitentpentwitch> Especially useful for backstab attacks
[2:46:59] <Garry_Guyface> lmao cull is so broken
[2:47:03] <+SpookyCookieMonster> pat really hates turn() right?
[2:47:19] <Animorphimagi> how far into the game?
[2:47:49] <LoneFonte> just finished the spine
[2:47:56] <snakemuho> about 70%
[2:48:11] <musti_jaja_> howdy
[2:48:14] <Animorphimagi> oh. so basically endgame time now
[2:48:22] <penitentpentwitch> @SpookyCookieMonster There is a benefit to saving it. If you take a fatal hit when not recharging you do an Emergency Turn rather than losing an ability. I can understand hesitation to use Turn for that, at least.
[2:48:38] <Dragon_Batman> Yea not too far from the end but just alot of stuff in that portion
[2:48:45] <musti_jaja_> how are ya finding transistor?
[2:49:08] <heartlesshealer> SingsNote SingsNote SingsNote
[2:49:08] <penitentpentwitch> Progress wise, we're between halfway and two-thirds point.
[2:49:23] <user_naim> !uptime
[2:49:23] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 49m.
[2:50:56] <heartlesshealer> 👏👏
[2:50:56] <Ipsenscastle> Cull is the MVP
[2:51:01] <musti_jaja_> good job!
[2:51:05] <Dragon_Batman> Good shit
[2:51:10] <%SirGO0SE> it do what it say
[2:51:18] <heartlesshealer> 3 of 7
[2:51:18] <+oda_flobunaga> CULL()=GOAT()
[2:51:23] <penitentpentwitch> Cull is that big uppercut for spike damage
[2:51:34] <OvaltineDream> cull0
[2:51:37] <%Sycada> Cull is Big Number
[2:51:43] <penitentpentwitch> Unmasking into a Cull can one shot quite a few things
[2:51:54] <%AzureGale> Is that dog in the background
[2:52:28] <stormhawk9891> Dead Doggo
[2:53:46] <PatchySouls> This test reminds me of Hades and its boon progression
[2:53:52] <PatchySouls> :o
[2:53:53] <PatchySouls> :O
[2:54:14] <heartlesshealer> So good
[2:54:18] <+SpookyCookieMonster> i love charm
[2:54:27] <@commanderclaw> Marin fucking Karin
[2:54:34] <0mnis_edge> Yeah get and jaunt
[2:54:38] <heartlesshealer> bork busted
[2:54:41] <+oda_flobunaga> doesn't work on some bosses though
[2:55:48] <Animorphimagi> hey Pat. are you going to play Cyberpunk on stream when it comes out? and if not, what's your next big anticipated game, other than Silksong?
[2:56:32] <0mnis_edge> I hate how you can't hurt your charmed allies.
[2:56:34] <Dragon_Batman> lol
[2:56:50] <@commanderclaw> I'm looking forward to Baldur's Gate 3
[2:56:53] <%AzureGale> I don't think there's a game called Christ
[2:56:58] <penitentpentwitch> Has there been any updates about Silksong, I feel they went dark a year ago
[2:57:09] <%dasmause> @PatStaresAt are you gonna play ULTRAKILL, and if yes then is it soon or when its fully released?
[2:57:24] <musti_jaja_> how is transistor compared to bastion pat?
[2:57:28] <%JD_Lars> Thinking about streaming PS5 event on Wednesday?
[2:57:30] <Dragon_Batman> Yea I only remember the nintendo tree house thing a while back
[2:57:36] <%CzeekyPlays> Darkest Dungeon 2 miiiiight be something in a year or two?
[2:58:06] <$dalmek> Spelunky 2 in a few weeks I think
[2:58:41] <heartlesshealer> =T
[2:58:46] <Animorphimagi> lol. he says "of course" to playing cyberpunk but he has said he wants to keep some games to himself so he doesn't have to go by stream schedule.
[2:59:22] <%CzeekyPlays> @Animorphimagi why would you ask just to try to dunk on him
[2:59:44] <$dalmek> I think Crash makes things vulnerable to "non-Crash" attacks
[2:59:49] <%afronooch> how dare pat want to play games for himself instead of us idiots
[2:59:54] <penitentpentwitch> @musti_jaja_ Bastion has a more forgiving combat system. Transistor has a stronger sense of theme. Both are good.
[3:00:07] <$RealThiele> even gief knows to avoid moldy potato salad
[3:00:15] <mozu_madness> w
[3:00:17] <Dragon_Batman> lol
[3:00:20] <musti_jaja_> ye @penitentpentwitch
[3:00:23] <heartlesshealer> w
[3:00:27] <Animorphimagi> @czeekyplays I do want him to play it. if he says he will that's only good news
[3:00:52] <heartlesshealer> get that cheerleader
[3:00:53] <%Sycada> Why does Pat hate jaunting in Turn()?
[3:01:07] <mozu_madness> is this game ever gonna come to xbox ive been waiting for years
[3:01:14] <penitentpentwitch> @dalmek Correct! More accurately, attacks that make targets 'vulnerable' do not get a damage buff from the enemy having the 'vulnerable' debuff.
[3:01:33] <heartlesshealer> bye Jaunt, you weren't used
[3:01:43] <musti_jaja_> @mozu_madness low chance sadly, don't have a PC or other system for it?
[3:01:45] <$dalmek> @penitentpentwitch thanks for the clarification. It's been years so I wasn't sure
[3:01:45] <penitentpentwitch> Oh dear, many dogs

[3:02:19] <%ElkRiverDog> psaBig psaDogchamp sipsipHonk
[3:02:23] <musti_jaja_> sunglasses
[3:02:31] <penitentpentwitch> @dalmek A lot of effects in this game aren't explicit. It's one of the downsides to this game in that it forces you to experiment to learn, rather than have more informative tooltips.
[3:02:33] <mozu_madness> i have it on switch and ps4 i just really want it on xbox
[3:02:43] <Ipsenscastle> I remember this really stressing me out

[3:04:00] <heartlesshealer> bye Cull
[3:04:09] <%AzureGale> Cull was culled
[3:04:13] <%superc37> nice one pat
[3:04:17] <mozu_madness> you askin mr streamer?
[3:04:56] <heartlesshealer> everything's on eternal cooldown after a turn, so use your enemy stealing ability right before a turn if you want a decoy
[3:05:07] <+SpookyCookieMonster> gattem
[3:05:14] <heartlesshealer> also good job
[3:05:18] <Dragon_Batman> Nice
[3:05:24] <musti_jaja_> good jerb pat

[3:14:29] <penitentpentwitch> The Bork Space Program
[3:14:37] <+Toblo1> YEET
[3:14:43] <huskarl_zap> Weed three is just Krokodil laced weed
[3:14:54] <user_naim> @penitentpentwitch fuck thats good
[3:15:10] <%Daniel_Is_I> Weed 2.0 had planned obsolescence.
[3:15:15] <%Daniel_Is_I> 3.0 is where it's at
[3:15:16] <+SpookyCookieMonster> look at it fly lmao
[3:15:22] <+Dova573> I feel jaunt is kinda shitty as a dodge maneuver
[3:15:28] <+Toblo1> Big Yeetus
[3:15:40] <penitentpentwitch> Cull is good as a big hit and indirect CC
[3:15:44] <+Dova573> the recovery after it just fucks you
[3:16:13] <SummonerMagno> When is Pat getting a shark hoodie to boost views??
[3:16:14] <+SpookyCookieMonster> jaunt is back!
[3:16:17] <penitentpentwitch> Remove limiter, read limiter lore.
[3:16:55] <heartlesshealer> "arrangement"
[3:17:13] <%superc37> Pat the limiter
[3:17:59] <%superc37> @patstaresat check makes it so that touching an enemy while in turn becomes an attack
[3:18:24] <heartlesshealer> Yeah, so now walking is actually useful
[3:18:39] <Dragon_Batman> Football go brr
[3:18:53] <@StridentSong> @PatStaresAt You may not get as much use out of it since you use Turn() a lot, but using Help() with Spark() and Crash() sub systems give you two Lunas that stun things they bark at
[3:19:25] <heartlesshealer> that's always fun
[3:20:29] <penitentpentwitch> Note! The floor pattern that emerges in their impact crater prevents Turn. This means if you are full on Turn and take a fatal hit, you are prevented an Emergency Turn and lose an ability.
[3:20:32] <%Saltmeisterr> i bout to boot up transistor just to try that strident
[3:20:32] <+SpookyCookieMonster> super user is op
[3:20:55] <arkv01> is pat using a voice mod for the narrator?
[3:21:19] <Dragon_Batman> Nah that's just how he is modulated
[3:21:30] <heartlesshealer> Fortitude
[3:22:19] <heartlesshealer> cull = jaunt
[3:22:19] <penitentpentwitch> I do love all the weird buffs recursive abilities get in New Game Plus.
[3:22:29] <@StridentSong> Another fun one is Ping() with Surge() and Switch(). It poisons them and converts them, but since the poison hits first, they lose HP even though they stop attacking you and help
[3:22:31] <%mike2hands> Hey pat , how are you today ?
[3:22:37] <+LandOfTheWay> it's been years since i played this game, but i remember using a setup with Get that let me cheese the game even with all limiters on
[3:22:44] <%SirGO0SE> nothing peronel kid
