I am in the application process, because I have finally hit an income I can reasonably afford my own apartment, by which I mean half my take-home pay after-taxes a month, because Oregon is expensive as fuck. Paige may know the town and may slightly cringe, but it is on the outskirts of Gresham, and thus the good part of Gresham. So I am a happy cat, but never as happy as Elmo.

[3:26:10] <%captainthunderwolf> @ZoeyKillJoy Honestly, it's because Hip-Hop is most relevant genre.
[3:26:10] <%Dr_DangerPhD> reason its so offputing is that it reminds you of borderlands so much

[4:29:49] <+JenovasPuppet> Pat in bed with Peach every night "What!? Oh that's not how I thought that was going to happen"
[4:29:51] <CrypticMochi> So all the smashes are on hit now?
[4:29:51] <+SparkAfterDark> They all suck at smash because they showered too recently
[4:29:52] <DracaenaLeaf> This is a disaster
[4:29:53] <OwlLightningMage> Fuggins blew the lead BibleThump
[4:29:58] <alcors_wisdom> its because your controllers registered in a different order when pat relaunched the game
[4:29:58] <%skizzuto> you guys got switched because fuggins hit his controller before paige so it thought he was player 2, it does the same thing in smash 4
[4:30:00] <$GohanEgret> @Tokanova if you charge up that S flag, I believe
[4:30:01] <mostundesired> That stock up is the fucking best thing, people will kill you IRL just so you don't use it.
[4:30:01] <arcaderabbit48> @SirSmudgey They changed a lot of smashes. They're more cinematic now, in the vein of Duck Hunt or Captain Falcon
[4:30:03] <ducethegamer> Pat getting ready for the Fisticuffs huh?

[4:51:58] <+HelloImTom08> trust is a weakness
[4:51:58] <$philoboy123> the fake ones are the logo upside down
[4:52:06] <+JenovasPuppet> Samus is the Japanese Majima!
[4:52:07] <%skizzuto> @A_Zealous_Retort the thick and thin lines of the crosshair on the logo are switched
[4:52:07] <+Antoids> you can tell theyre fake if the ratio or position of the two lines isnt brand-accurate
[4:52:07] <IHaveNoFunnyName> I'm pretty sure there are a bunch of different types of fake ones
[4:52:09] <+barretzm> The colors are different
[4:52:10] <%Your_Friendly_Futa> Are you exited for Bloodborne 2 Paige? It looks pretty hype
[4:52:15] <IHaveNoFunnyName> Not moving, wrong logo, different colours etc...
[4:52:20] <%JGardner88> @arcaderabbit48 its subtle if your not looking but the thickness of the lines are switched

[5:31:02] <mostundesired> Marth is bad? What year am I in?
[5:31:06] <DaHaLoJeDi> JUST THE TIP
[5:31:06] <Stoike> since we're speaking our local lingua franca : cunt, fourex, bogan
[5:31:07] <%Beough> @AngriestPat GOODNIGHT GUYS
[5:31:07] <%seaearthandsky> Quebec french is to ghetto for smash LUL
[5:31:08] <+gantz_zero> his tip is sensitive @AngriestPat
[5:31:11] <masso101> Tout le monde ici
[5:31:12] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> Lucina is the consistent version of Marth and that makes her playable LUL
[5:31:12] <+Great_Sage> marth is always amazing because of the tipper
[5:31:12] <+Rhinoprotoss> He's wrong
[5:31:12] <powerprotoman> pats crazy talk
[5:31:13] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @OceanGovernor Other way. Parisians hate veryone
[5:31:15] <TheDarthRyu719> @mostundesired 2018. Stop time travelling. Kappa
[5:31:16] <OwlLightningMage> Marth is bad in every game he has ever been in
[5:31:16] <+jishjoshjash> I just want to unlock Dark Pit so I can play the game.
[5:31:16] <%Ninestempest> Lucina is just somewhat better cause her blade is balanced
[5:31:17] <Stoike> Lucina sucks
[5:31:18] <+barretzm> Quebec French doesn't exist to the world
[5:31:18] <mostundesired> But Lucina does less damage over all.
[5:31:19] <%Ninestempest> can I get a 1 chat
[5:31:21] <+Great_Sage> Pat is suuuuper wrong
[5:31:22] <+ChaosVulpes> Marth "Just the Tip" Jones
[5:31:22] <Rincewind1998> So the tipper, one of the strongest things about Marth, makes him bad?
[5:31:23] <mostundesired> 1
[5:31:24] <Umbrul> 1
[5:31:24] <ThePuddingDead> I THOUGHT THIS WAS Devil May Cry theme from 3 for a hot second
[5:31:24] <+McSnazzyPants> marth is good BECAUSE of the tip
[5:31:25] <%Ninestempest> Pat is the most wrong
[5:31:25] <%Beough> 1
[5:31:27] <%doc_ock_rokc> Marths smashs are based on spacing
[5:31:27] <$lolslowking> Okay then explain Roy???
[5:31:28] <Rincewind1998> Fuckign Pat
[5:31:28] <troxcree> Marth is good if you're good.
[5:31:30] <Stoike> Lucina shouldn't have been created
[5:31:31] <%Ninestempest> 1
[5:31:32] <succ699> Where my girl peach at! I demand the disabled
[5:31:32] <shadic7701> 1
[5:31:33] <+Mutraex> his tip is less consistent but he's still good
[5:31:35] <%Aleate> That was actually pretty rad
[5:31:35] <zafooru> hey look its palutena over there
[5:31:36] <salty_syd913> 1
[5:31:37] <+Freakgurru> the mounties need their horses the french Cans need their wine and the Newfoundlanders need their Sodomy
[5:31:37] <+Great_Sage> 1
[5:31:38] <PanicSwytch> sound track is good
[5:31:38] <$Piemono> 1
[5:31:38] <Hanbei1708> lucina is marth for children
[5:31:38] <%TheOpinionater> 1
[5:31:40] <+NopeBadguy> !raffle
[5:31:40] <@Moobot> Added one or more users to the raffle
[5:31:40] <DaHaLoJeDi> Also yeah Lucina is better if you can't hit tippers because her damage is averaged out along the length of her sword
[5:31:41] <snake_zen> 1
[5:31:41] <+gantz_zero> french cowardice
[5:31:42] <SuperBen97> 1
[5:31:43] <time_axis> the french need no items
[5:31:43] <TheDarthRyu719> The French are too good for items Kappa
[5:31:43] <zafooru> france FORBIDS items
[5:31:43] <BeNiceImShy> The French HATE items
[5:31:44] <$nademonkey1100> and white flags
[5:31:44] <Graywolf_the_45th> 1
[5:31:44] <%Aleate> Only white flags Kappa
[5:31:47] <+Tokanova> "We determined french players, HATE items."
[5:31:47] <%jiin6> Marth has pointy
[5:31:49] <NonAddictiveSlurm> Marth is best played as a grappler, i know this from melee Kappa
[5:31:50] <booglesnurf> Marth is just the tip but Lucina brings the whole shaft
[5:31:51] <+gantz_zero> 1
[5:31:51] <%doc_ock_rokc> FRENCH ARE ALL MELEE PLAYERS
[5:31:52] <Hanbei1708> just like awakening is FE for children Kappa
[5:31:52] <Ropcord> le fucc
[5:31:53] <git_loe> fuque
[5:31:54] <wsintai> The French lack the mental capacity to comprehend items on screen

[5:32:08] <+gantz_zero> omfg it's so big :ahegao:
[5:32:08] <DaHaLoJeDi> But Marth is better if you can't consistently land tips because of the damage and KO potential being so good
[5:32:09] <TheDarthRyu719> France needs the items for the Soul Calibur finals
[5:32:09] <NonAddictiveSlurm> what

[6:05:59] <TheFilth> when are we getting Bloodborne in Smash?

[6:31:33] <leviathan666303> In mathematical measure theory, for every positive integer n the ham sandwich theorem states that given n measurable "objects" in n-dimensional Euclidean space, it is possible to divide all of them in half (with respect to their measure, i.e. volume) with a single (n − 1)-dimensional hyperplane.
[6:31:34] <succ699> These beautiful siblings

[6:46:23] <TheDarthRyu719> @leviathan666303 How? Just...how?
[6:46:24] <%Dragonfang1337> only a pearl necklace with link Kappa
[6:46:25] <OwlLightningMage> Math basically become magic and lies after a certain point LUL
[6:46:30] <DaHaLoJeDi> A PEARL NECKLACE = SNEAKING IN DIRTY SHIT UNDER THE RADAR LUL
[6:46:30] <Dragon_Batman> not even Popo Kappa
[6:46:36] <Admiral_PopnFresh> um, Popo is a dude
[6:46:39] <TheDarthRyu719> pearl necklace is a decent ZZ Top song
[6:46:43] <gnarly_memes_bro> Paige is the only true gamer here
[6:46:55] <BlackfyreRoy> I got jesus on my neckalace
[6:46:55] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> gamers rise up. and say no to vapes

[6:47:17] <TheDarthRyu719> @leviathan666303 Aahhhh fuck you're right
[6:47:19] <%LouieRouie> Yeah that's rest
[6:47:19] <%Order_of_Mystery> Iam ze ubermensche!
[6:47:21] <SulfurousAcid> Does Paige not know about Rest?
[6:47:21] <gnarly_memes_bro> @Sphincter_Spelunker gaming is in our dna, its our birthright to rise up
[6:47:29] <+GuelermeDias> just a big ice dick
[6:47:38] <leviathan666303> @Jontman42 he gets it
[6:47:41] <+GuelermeDias> this stage kinda sucks
[6:47:48] <DaHaLoJeDi> HIT THE REST PEACH
[6:47:49] <RollCritFail> Inb4 Paige gets a EVO tier Rest KO
[6:47:49] <$ooblagis> It does BIG DAMAGE
[6:47:50] <+GuelermeDias> at least it's not P O K E F L O A T S
[6:47:50] <Dragon_Batman> I'm pretty shure Paige doesn't know 100 percent of the moves in this game
[6:47:56] <+lethallunacyx> Paige doesn't know about anything
[6:47:59] <TheDarthRyu719> I'm salty because I will be living in a cardboard box with my Spider-Man vs Superman scripts
[6:48:01] <+SergeantSov> Big rest
[6:48:02] <Chaos80omega> I'm sad that I have to wait until the morning to get this game
[6:48:03] <AlexanderTheConquerer> crazy talk activating
[6:48:15] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Yeah, because H-Box falls asleep on accident all the time Kappa
[6:48:18] <BeeNoons> dormir
[6:48:22] <+Chitsuhana> I guess Pat doesn't know about rest either
[6:48:23] <+GuelermeDias> OH NO
[6:48:29] <+Ssaik> P U F F
[6:48:29] <TheDarthRyu719> Where is my "I have to wait for Christmas because I'm broke but my relatives arent" camp?
[6:48:32] <drfights> Oh. BIG
[6:48:33] <+GuelermeDias> cursed puff
[6:48:36] <%Everpresent_Overseer> I managed to catch the stream!
[6:48:37] <Gorgen> KAIJU
[6:48:40] <SulfurousAcid> Pat how do you not know about Rest
[6:48:43] <TheDarthRyu719> Biggie Puffs
[6:48:48] <doctor_piranha> Jiggly is a Kaiju confirmed
[6:48:50] <%TheMattman1313> @AngriestPat that bat noise was a successful rest, which does a lot of damage and knockback. Also makes Puff go to sleep.
[6:48:52] <TheDarthRyu719> Biggie Smalls Puff Daddy
[6:48:54] <DaHaLoJeDi> That's Rest, Paige, the only hitbox is on the eyes at the moment they close but it does FUCKING RIDICULOUS KNOCKBACK and can KO someone at like 10% or so
[6:49:06] <mercado94> ???
[6:49:07] <gnarly_memes_bro> @AngriestPat did you realize that Joker's VO is the smash announcer?
[6:49:09] <+JavaManJoJo> @TheDarthRyu719 my friend ISN'T broke but he knows his family is already buying him Smash so he has to fight not just getting it anyway
[6:49:18] <NME_Dom> Rest is a move that will basicly destroy a person, it has to be on the opponent, but it has a hard punnish @AngriestPat
[6:49:19] <+GuelermeDias> SPIKED RIGHT IN THE BUTT
[6:49:22] <doctor_piranha> That down b is point blank range attack Paige
[6:49:44] <Chaos80omega> Man I absolutely love the implementation of the smash meter
[6:49:44] <%Dragonfang1337> LUL
[6:49:51] <pshuuu> yea gurl
[6:49:52] <nepwar> LUL

[6:50:24] <BlackfyreRoy> One of the worst starters.
[6:50:25] <floatRand> Throwing around explosive poop?
[6:50:32] <BeeNoons> needles
[6:50:34] <TheDarthRyu719> Stages built for 8 Player Smash should be automatically disables from random
[6:50:35] <%Everpresent_Overseer> Seed bomb
[6:50:47] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Grass starters for life CoolCat
[6:50:51] <+GuelermeDias> lol pat
[6:50:54] <DaHaLoJeDi> Jigglypuff is one of the lightest characters in the game
[6:50:54] <$rdark_ksu> i think thats just the map cause this shit is just sprawling
[6:50:55] <OwlLightningMage> Bad starters are depressing
[6:50:58] <Dragon_Batman> I'm pretty shure every stage has the ability to be on 8 player
[6:51:01] <+GuelermeDias> i was about to ask why the fuck you were hitting the other climber
[6:51:05] <BlackfyreRoy> I'm pretty shure too man
[6:51:10] <LifesNeverHumDrum> what a move
[6:51:20] <TheDarthRyu719> The blatantly built for 8 Player
[6:51:39] <LifesNeverHumDrum> git gud at large frozen masses
[6:51:45] <TheDarthRyu719> If i have a time machine, I'm going to snap kindergarten me for complaining about the size of Hyrulw Temple in Melee
[6:51:49] <%TheWallOfMeat> WOW that range
[6:51:50] <Naho_Saenoki> I just got home, everyone. So was there any announcement at the Game Awards?
[6:51:51] <floatRand> D e l e t e d
[6:51:52] <Dragon_Batman> yea just like every stage has a battlefield
[6:52:03] <+Ssaik> DON'T TRY IT
[6:52:04] <Dragon_Batman> variant
[6:52:04] <+Punchasaur> Gen 5 has pretty lame starters
[6:52:12] <leviathan666303> its over pat i have the moral high ground
[6:52:12] <DaHaLoJeDi> Joker from P5 in Smash

[6:52:38] <Dragon_Batman> Techincally i would say yea
[6:52:38] <%TheWallOfMeat> We live in a world where Kirby v. Joker in a fighting game is possible.

[6:52:52] <+Punchasaur> Lisa Ann Zelda
[6:52:54] <LifesNeverHumDrum> why not both
[6:52:55] <+NWR_James> THIS SONG IS SO GOOD
[6:52:55] <$ooblagis> Best new Remix in the game
[6:52:56] <TheDarthRyu719> That's strong
[6:53:02] <DaHaLoJeDi> Google it now, he has a trailer and everything
[6:53:03] <+AlfredoChicken> SourPls
[6:53:14] <DaHaLoJeDi> Also GOD I LOVE THIS FUCKING REMIX
[6:53:18] <Dragon_Batman> That's a really good song dam
[6:53:19] <Innocuous_Goat> There's a fixed unlock order, but it's nonsensical
[6:53:20] <BeeNoons> dankey crank
[6:53:23] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Mai stando [ THE BIG RED DOG ]
[6:53:34] <Admiral_PopnFresh> HYPERCLAP
[6:53:37] <gnarly_memes_bro> he got the BOOT
[6:53:40] <LifesNeverHumDrum> heowwww
[6:53:42] <$ooblagis> He's apparently really good too
[6:53:42] <doctor_piranha> Nice shot Pat!
[6:53:49] <leviathan666303> the real question is bowser a kaiju @AngriestPat
[6:53:52] <TheDarthRyu719> Back when I was a stupid kid playing Melee, my cousin lied and said if I wait long enough, Cranky would come out and I could unlock him
[6:53:53] <Innocuous_Goat> Like, Palutena is the very last character you unlock this way
[6:53:53] <+Abbis> It's funny how much more people like K Rool in general than donkey kong
[6:53:58] <+Buytoast> best part is that there's even a Crocodile Cacophony remix in here too
[6:53:58] <gnarly_memes_bro> falcon has the knee but zelda has the BOOT
[6:54:00] <zamzoph> PAT LIKES HIM CUZ HE WANTS TO CHEAT
[6:54:02] <AdmiralButtloaf> Call Arin Hanson and discuss if things are Kaiju lol
[6:54:03] <+NADeusX> Can smash bloom on the battlefield
[6:54:03] <+Punchasaur> Lol the fallout
[6:54:08] <+Punchasaur> Callout
[6:54:09] <TheDarthRyu719> That's how he unlocked Mewtwo. Because I'm an idiot.
[6:54:13] <%foreverN2dust> Big Black Croc
[6:54:33] <DukeMoose> this room Stinks! that means they could go pro
[6:54:35] <+SuichiTanaka> Wombo
[6:54:39] <Dragon_Batman> so if you just fought without resetting you would do release order?
[6:54:48] <TheDarthRyu719> That's just Paige's fartgas
[6:54:49] <gnarly_memes_bro> cuck-o
[6:54:51] <leviathan666303> hey cucko

[6:55:01] <mercado94> CUCK O
[6:55:02] <TheDarthRyu719> And Elmo's greasiness
[6:55:04] <DaHaLoJeDi> His recovery is ridiculous for a heavy, he's got fast and hard-hitting tilt and smash attacks, he gets Super Armor on a lot of his attacks, he has janky projectiles that are good at fucking you up, and because he's a super-heavyweight he's SO HARD to kill, yeah K.rool is great Kappa
[6:55:07] <Innocuous_Goat> No, the order is nonsense
[6:55:08] <nepwar> THE MARCH OF THE CUCK-Os
[6:55:09] <Stoike> cuckoos, my favourite cereal

[6:56:37] <SteelyCorvid> Distorted Lizard Impact
[6:56:44] <Naho_Saenoki> @Dragon_Batman The character is right in the middle of the eyehole.
[6:56:44] <booglesnurf> There's nothing inherently wrong with having a cuckoo in smash
[6:56:46] <DaHaLoJeDi> It throws you to DK Island and blows it up
[6:56:48] <%foreverN2dust> LUL

[7:02:51] <Dragon_Batman> Yes @thedannydarko
[7:02:51] <gnarly_memes_bro> @AdmiralButtloaf no its because sakurai saw persona on the list of possible dlc he could do and he chose joker immediately because he liked p5 a lot

[7:02:59] <DaHaLoJeDi> Oh yeah, K rool's recovery can float up from almost the bottom blast line and it protects you from getting spiked because the propeller is a hitbox
