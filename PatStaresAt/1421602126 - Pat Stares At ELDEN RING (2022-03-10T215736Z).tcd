[0:03:50] <Nordguy> Time for Old Hole!!
[0:04:07] <%JoshManVGH> This is the type of game where I wouldn't be shocked if somone opened a door and found themselves in Elden Ring 2
[0:04:08] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> I just noticed Paige didn't even shoot the gun in the opening

[0:04:49] <%JoshManVGH> He hopes to absorb the hotdogs from you
[0:04:54] <Big_Dream> you smell like meat
[0:05:02] <%luftraumm1> @PatStaresAt hey pattycakes! have you checked on woolie's progress recently?
[0:05:13] <bran316555> Nutrition achieved for Pat
[0:05:20] <lyzejag> Woolie is making good progress rn
[0:05:21] <%JoshManVGH> I imagine that cradling that dog takes some arm heft.
[0:05:26] <marvel877> You smell like meat like that one episode of Invader Zim. Pat is now turning into hot dog meat.
[0:05:38] <SilverChariotAxel> @PatStaresAt how many shardbeares have you killed?
[0:05:38] <%luftraumm1> Yay!
[0:05:50] <%luftraumm1> yeah that place is tearing him a new one

[0:06:33] <@Spydurman> watch there will be a brand new map
[0:06:40] <tanarath> but what if you're only like 33% done?
[0:06:51] <%Smokay17> Has Pat not finished the prologue still? Seesh.
[0:06:52] <%cade_calrayn> Farum Azula is a legacy dungeon

[0:07:07] <%cade_calrayn> Farum Azula is a *big* dungeon
[0:07:15] <@Spydurman> idk man are you high enough level for that boss?
[0:07:16] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt you also have the haligtree
[0:07:19] <Guardiansaiyan> sup
[0:07:28] <+UltimortalMoth> Hi Pat and Chat hope you are doing well today
[0:07:29] <%JoshManVGH> My money is on Bloodbrone where each boss leads to another boss, but like 7 times in a row.
[0:07:37] <YokaiZee> I just got the platinum myself like 10 min ago
[0:07:39] <%cade_calrayn> Oh yeah the Haligtree is *also* a legacy dungeon
[0:07:48] <Guardiansaiyan> @PatStaresAt what happened to video quality?
[0:07:49] <%luftraumm1> the USSY is strong today
[0:07:53] <@Spydurman> LUL keep it up
[0:07:59] <SilverChariotAxel> @PatStaresAt You still have a Optional Legacy dungeon
[0:08:02] <%ThomasOfTroy> It seems normal to me
[0:08:08] <+UltimortalMoth> big boy big snores
[0:08:11] <@Spydurman> fine for me
[0:08:13] <Guardiansaiyan> @PatStaresAt you look 720P
[0:08:13] <ebrion> Turn the twitch add block off
[0:08:22] <mrcelab> yep
[0:08:24] <Nordguy> baby BIG loud
[0:08:34] <%luftraumm1> Rump ahead
[0:08:41] <%blastyoboots> @Guardiansaiyan turn it up from 720p?
[0:08:43] <Guardiansaiyan> @ebrion I use ublock origin
[0:08:46] <%TarikBot> Puppy snores are like a lovely backdrop to the talking
[0:08:51] <Nordguy> baby bring atmosphere
[0:08:51] <Guardiansaiyan> its at 1080p
[0:08:56] <Guardiansaiyan> I put it there
[0:08:57] <+UltimortalMoth> fat baby
[0:09:01] <Guardiansaiyan> guess it takes a while?
[0:09:05] <jubejube56> Dog completes cube
[0:09:08] <%blastyoboots> oh you're right it looks kind of buzzy, the image in 1080p

[0:09:32] <Guardiansaiyan> just Pat looked 720p
[0:09:40] <mrcelab> @PatStaresAt Elden Ring without Giefs snoring is not a genuine Pat stream
[0:09:46] <ebrion> @Guardiansaiyan I will check that out, another one quit working recently.
[0:09:53] <%cade_calrayn> Honestly the Haligtree will probably be it’s own stream, Pat
[0:10:11] <%espanishcanamurciana> Alright I don’t want spoilers have fun Pat!
[0:10:16] <+Dustwalker44> oh lord you can get yourself to look so bad ass in thisgame
[0:10:20] <ZachariasBass> Hype!
[0:10:28] <sundizzle> do you have half of the secret medallion? it tells you about the haligtree
[0:10:32] <%crimsonharvest> i did a lot of running past fights here, tired of trying so hard
[0:10:35] <%octavian_wolf> that was sick!
[0:10:37] <%luftraumm1> this game got big numbers
[0:10:39] <%radiorosewater> oh hey pat stream
[0:10:43] <%zarkazeon> go to the castle near the back of this map peice for haligtree
[0:10:44] <mrcelab> Classic question Pat, what did You off stream???
[0:10:57] <+Shimano232> Hey Pat, not sure if you've gotten this tip already. But you can kill all the random no name merchants across the world and give all the bells to the hub merchant to make 1 mega shop.
[0:10:57] <%cade_calrayn> Nope! It’s its own legacy dungeon
[0:11:12] <Saturation_Lizard> this place was my rune farm before i found moghwyn palace, the zamor heroes drop boss-tier runes on death (because of course they are bosses)
[0:11:20] <%blastyoboots> how much Endurance u got
[0:11:21] <%cade_calrayn> You have to go to Castle Sol for the medallion and then it’s a whole process to reach the tree
[0:11:23] <%luftraumm1> Oh you DID??? Good Job
[0:11:27] <mrcelab> what did you get from him?
[0:11:42] <%BlueLunecy> Outplayed
[0:11:54] <sundizzle> miniboss aka normal enemy

[0:12:52] <%luftraumm1> why the hell are there Ghost TREES here?
[0:12:54] <%blastyoboots> better jump a lot in case Hidden Floor >_>"
[0:13:02] <%Pookiedaexzile> That Depends on whether you're gonna break the walls DOWN
[0:13:09] <$HyperionXV> Hello folks. VoHiYo raysH
[0:13:20] <%blastyoboots> @luftraumm1 where do trees go when they die
[0:13:31] <%luftraumm1> hulo!

[0:13:39] <%greasypete00> what is that helmet it looks great
[0:13:53] <%luftraumm1> @blastyoboots never knew trees had souls
[0:14:18] <sundizzle> gottem
[0:14:19] <lyzejag> Gottem
[0:14:20] <%radiorosewater> birds should follow
[0:14:21] <%blastyoboots> @luftraumm1 you need to kill a tree and check how many souls it gives you.  I mean runes
[0:14:24] <%imthewisejanitor> Treeees aaare ussss...
[0:14:31] <%MaybeFalco> bird up
[0:14:53] <jubejube56> I mean considering there is a super holy special tree
[0:14:54] <%luftraumm1> @imthewisejanitor godamn that welcome to  nightvale episode is ANCIENT
[0:15:02] <jubejube56> Maybe trees get to be in the afterlife
[0:15:17] <Guardiansaiyan> @PatStaresAt water levels?
[0:15:23] <%crimsonharvest> im so glad it doesnt have shitty piano and chime music
[0:15:24] <+Cecrios> Nobody likes an ice level company
[0:15:31] <Nordguy> a cum panied
[0:15:34] <%greasypete00> accompanied by?
[0:15:34] <%radiorosewater> a compogne
[0:15:36] <%Pookiedaexzile> A Cum-pan-ied
[0:15:40] <%Felhad> Waiting for the bus in the rain
[0:15:42] <razz_zie> Do u smell burnt toast rn Pat?
[0:15:43] <%radiorosewater> sardines
[0:15:47] <TheSandmanIsHere> a company
[0:15:48] <+dudlerand> acumpany
[0:15:54] <%blastyoboots> COMbust vs CUMbust
[0:16:00] <+ScrapKingKeita> slide puzzles DansGame
[0:16:02] <@Spydurman> uh-cum-pun-need
[0:16:02] <%luftraumm1> a Cum panini?
[0:16:05] <atlasdotwav> Pat fight pat yet?
[0:16:12] <%crimsonharvest> the slippyness is only good if it leads to sick ramp jumps
[0:16:19] <%luftraumm1> cum paninis must be horrible
[0:16:19] <critterfreak> Or when there is "Cold Damage" from being in an area.
[0:16:21] <%blastyoboots> Pat fight PAT, fight pat.
[0:16:23] <+ScrapKingKeita> I sure /loved/ the Ice temple in FFX /s
[0:16:23] <%greasypete00> ice physics are fun when you can gain mega speed from them and there isnt annoying platforming to do with it
[0:16:23] <%radiorosewater> TRIBES 2 WAS THE SHIT I LOVE SLIPPYNESS
[0:16:23] <bobxmaker> i'm so sad, my girl died in my game
[0:16:24] <%imthewisejanitor> @imthewisejanitor Glad at least one person got it! LUL
[0:16:33] <jubejube56> Idk why but I’m fondly remembering the ice level from Spector of torment
[0:16:47] <Saturation_Lizard> this part starts very narrow
[0:16:47] <Giztech> @PatStaresAt that maker is deceiving it actually down the other side of the hill
[0:16:48] <%KishinGrek> well I just met the eye of Sauron and his wonderful madness
[0:17:04] <%blastyoboots> Shazbot!
[0:17:08] <%luftraumm1> @imthewisejanitor i'm surprised someone brought those trees up
[0:17:19] <Druss_M> VGTG
[0:17:28] <%luftraumm1> Even more death
[0:17:31] <%Felhad> Pain ahead
[0:17:38] <@DakotaMacDoodle> good luck
[0:17:44] <%blastyoboots> hit the summon statue just to turn it on
[0:17:48] <%luftraumm1> @PatStaresAt gotta go fast
[0:17:52] <jubejube56> Damn maybe you’ll get to throw an even bigger rock
[0:18:06] <%crimsonharvest> ive never come into one that didnt hurt me
[0:18:07] <+GuildmasterAhnonay> So I still can't tell, does activating the summon statue actually DO anything
[0:18:11] <%barrakuta371> your welcome
[0:18:15] <%Daskolin> You welcome pat :D
[0:18:34] <sundizzle> the hero's graves are the real pain
[0:18:41] <%crimsonharvest> its mostly ok but when they get clever and im not ready for that, is when i suffer
[0:18:43] <+ScrapKingKeita> at least it isn't ones like the rot dungeon
[0:18:43] <ape_hawk> did you like the minidungeons in skyrim?
[0:18:50] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> after the first area or so, i just stopped going to them just cause the overall vibe felt similar between them
[0:18:50] <%Felhad> Hero's Graves are Pain Elementals
[0:18:52] <%greasypete00> that looks like a fake wall
[0:19:00] <%luftraumm1> your red juice isnt clearing your girthy vigour
[0:19:01] <Augus7717> damage will only get higher from here on out pat
[0:19:05] <atlasdotwav> This game has the best dungeons and dragons
[0:19:08] <MelfinaStarwind> melfin1Spin
[0:19:08] <tri3dgE027> weirdly enough these are more enjoyable to do in comparison to chalice dungeon...probably because all the cool shit it has at the end LuL
[0:19:14] <jubejube56> I’m just waiting for a random catacomb to exist that requires you to gesture at a wall while tossing 3 rainbow stones
[0:19:24] <%luftraumm1> OOOOO
[0:19:31] <%SveriSageAdvice> *thats why that's there lol*
[0:19:34] <Augus7717> wait its THIS ONE FUCK THIS ONE
[0:19:35] <%blastyoboots> SO THAT'S WHY it's there, to trick you into bringing THIS up!
[0:19:46] <%SveriSageAdvice> wait oh god right this one
[0:19:52] <%luftraumm1> these have been getting way more complex
[0:20:02] <%Daskolin> Use it again. Because you never know :)
[0:20:04] <%VictorVonLouche> lol
[0:20:04] <Nurdock> No way lol
[0:20:12] <sundizzle> maybe saturday, but lol
[0:20:12] <%SveriSageAdvice> tomorrow night? probably not Pat lol
[0:20:13] <Augus7717> no shot LUL
[0:20:13] <lyzejag> No way lmao
[0:20:15] <TwistParabola> yeahhh
[0:20:18] <atlasdotwav> oh this one...
[0:20:19] <%SveriSageAdvice> Saturday is a good chance
[0:20:20] <DensityD> ugly face, cute cat
[0:20:20] <%Daskolin> wait they are normal mob now?
[0:20:22] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> "ma, theres a weird cat outside"
[0:20:23] <%Daskolin> f that
[0:20:26] <mrcelab> bosses are regular now, ok
[0:20:27] <tri3dgE027> CHAOS
[0:20:28] <+ScrapKingKeita> KILL CHAOS
[0:20:31] <%cade_calrayn> You’ll get it done by Saturday or Sunday I think
[0:20:32] <%Felhad> Normal ass mob
[0:20:33] <%greasypete00> you could always do alternating streams
[0:20:37] <lyzejag> CHAOS ?
[0:20:38] <+noctofell> pyrooMA
[0:20:38] <%barrakuta371> r u serious? get outta here with this statue bullshit
[0:20:44] <Augus7717> you will finish it on monday/tuesday
[0:20:44] <Solvari> right somebody has to kill chaos
[0:20:47] <%MaybeFalco> definitely not by tomorrow night, my guess would be at least 3 more streams
[0:20:50] <%luftraumm1> don't thin thats a good assessment  of how much more there is
[0:20:52] <%cade_calrayn> The Haligtree, Farum Azula and the Mountaintop are what you have left
[0:20:55] <jubejube56> Do blunt weapons work against these ones too?
[0:20:56] <%crimsonharvest> also didnt fight this type of guy, wasted like 20 deaths tryin to work though it before giving in to coward strats
[0:21:00] <DensityD> LIVIN on the EDGE
[0:21:07] <%blastyoboots> what an asshole
[0:21:09] <@Spydurman> there's still all of Satan to handle
[0:21:12] <sundizzle> just a normal enemy
[0:21:13] <NewHamwall> Pain ahead
[0:21:16] <TwistParabola> yeahh
[0:21:20] <%Pookiedaexzile> Damn Pat you still dying to normal enemies
[0:21:21] <DensityD> can you get summoned spirits in for that?
[0:21:31] <%Daskolin> Wait they would not make you fight like 5 of these, do they?
[0:21:41] <DensityD> just the right amount of dastardly
[0:21:46] <Saturation_Lizard> @Daskolin :)
[0:21:46] <@Spydurman> @DensityD it's a boss turned normal enemy LUL
[0:21:48] <%luftraumm1> Stranger of paradise isn't gonna meke the same impact this  did
[0:21:49] <Augus7717> at least they give you a marika statue so you dont have to take the elevator down again
[0:21:51] <%greasypete00> iraq
[0:21:57] <%MaybeFalco> yknow i forgot stranger of paradise was coming out on pc, and then i remembered it was being released on epic
[0:22:02] <TheBlankAce> Its not full even out on early access until the 15th, you've got time
[0:22:07] <DensityD> I threw a rock at 'em!~
[0:22:09] <+GuildmasterAhnonay> its not just a boulder
[0:22:21] <%Daskolin> @Saturation_Lizard  oh ffs, goodbye melle build. I rerolling faith
[0:22:22] <BigFingerRo> so Pat, with your current knowledge, how would you rank this difficulty-wise compared to the other dark souls?
[0:22:27] <atlasdotwav> jits a have;
[0:22:39] <atlasdotwav> its a havel^
[0:22:42] <Omenaire_> completely agree
[0:22:42] <+Cityscape17> Hey pat, are there any "early" talismans you would recommend a new player gets?
[0:22:44] <+ratreborn> Depends on the boss
[0:22:46] <%luftraumm1> you can CHEESE way more in this game
[0:22:53] <%radiorosewater> it's as hard as ya want it to be
[0:23:02] <Samhotdamn> THat's what I thought too
[0:23:05] <micolash28> Malenia is absolute BS
[0:23:17] <+GuildmasterAhnonay> some of the main bosses can be really fucked, Radahn kicked my shit in for hours
[0:23:29] <+1shoting> why is game audio so bit crunched
[0:23:43] <%greasypete00> those fuckin crystalians
[0:23:46] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> true, but radahn could be also be done at lvl 200
[0:23:58] <Augus7717> more than half the game is optional though LUL
[0:24:10] <DensityD> blame pat
[0:24:17] <+GuildmasterAhnonay> 49 was what I saw
[0:24:18] <%Pookiedaexzile> "Optional"
[0:24:20] <lyzejag> 59:38 ?
[0:24:21] <%MaybeFalco> the entire game is optional
[0:24:21] <ebrion> I had to turn low latency off last week for that
[0:24:25] <Augus7717> 49
[0:24:28] <Augus7717> i think
[0:24:32] <%greasypete00> 100% of the game is optional
[0:24:33] <@Spydurman> 95% of the game is optional
[0:24:36] <lyzejag> ITS ALREADY BELOW 59 MINUTES ??
[0:24:37] <%luftraumm1> saw a YT recommend for a DEATHLESS in 3h40m
[0:24:39] <SQDizzy> wrongwarps are pretty strong
[0:24:51] <+GuildmasterAhnonay> every video game is optional, if you think about it
[0:24:53] <ape_hawk> ur face is optional
[0:24:54] <ape_hawk> lol
[0:24:56] <DensityD> 3 faces
[0:25:03] <@Spydurman> @greasypete00 we were so close Kappa
[0:25:06] <bobxmaker> if you have low levels and low upgrades the game is a lot harder, and rushing through it not knowing where to go is hard as balls
[0:25:06] <AlphaRayAllen> Wow $60 for a 40 minute game thanks fromsoft
[0:25:07] <%imthewisejanitor> @luftraumm1 Saw that too, shit is bonkers.
[0:25:08] <Solvari> is it like BOTW, just run to the final boss if you want to?
[0:25:12] <+xpakeo> i had no problem with radahn and it surprises me alot of people did
[0:25:18] <%MaybeFalco> the any% speedrun had some crazy shit in it, i recommend watching it once you finish
[0:25:20] <%ThomasOfTroy> Technically, it's 100% optional since people don't have to play it at all
[0:25:21] <DensityD> try tail cut
[0:25:36] <urkleturtle> you do get super-easy mode if you want, but only after beating radahn. the mimic summon is absurd
[0:25:36] <@Spydurman> @Solvari it seems like there's a few mandatory bosses before that but almost

[0:25:39] <%imthewisejanitor> PAZUZU...
[0:25:42] <ergulor> yum a patleta
[0:25:52] <ape_hawk> yknow, life itself is optional
[0:25:58] <oda_flobunaga> Has Pat done the dungeon in Caelid hidden behind a illusory cliff?
[0:26:00] <%Bluwizard21> But all bosses is insane to try to speedrun, if you choose to say all bosses are anything with a name
[0:26:01] <Solvari> @Solvari i see thanks
[0:26:04] <+ratreborn> what main boss are u on Pat? or are you just cleaning up now
[0:26:04] <atlasdotwav> The Depths Part 2
[0:26:05] <doster504> I think if I did my math right without glitches you only have to fight 10 bosses
[0:26:11] <Eye_of_the_red_giant> i just got here where are we

[0:26:22] <%luftraumm1> Mimic time?
[0:26:30] <%Nobrev> I found the blood priest down there but can't for the life of me find mohg and dung eater
[0:26:35] <Augus7717> people figured out a way to activate the lift in the capital when you take the teleporter from the tower of return
[0:26:36] <$HyperionXV> Some dungeon or other under the giant's mountain zone
[0:26:43] <+ZaheerMyHomeBoy> Did you beat that black bird that's around here yet?
[0:26:45] <%Glass_Muffin> @PatStaresAt I fully upgraded my mimic tear summon yesterday. Holy shit give that thing guts greatsword and that shit does WORK for you
[0:26:46] <ape_hawk> @luftraumm1 he cant, theres no summon symbol
[0:26:50] <Augus7717> it involves some heavy shenanigans and fuckery with pvp
[0:26:50] <+ZaheerMyHomeBoy> that shit was impossible
[0:26:52] <+GuildmasterAhnonay> To be fair the entire game becomes easy mode with the night and flame sword
[0:27:02] <+GuildmasterAhnonay> that thing is fucked busted
[0:27:13] <%luftraumm1> @ape_hawk oh shit diddnt notice
[0:27:30] <%Felhad> You don't have the right, o you don't have the right, you don't have the right o you don't have the right
[0:27:32] <jacksawjack> did I miss deeproot depths
[0:27:49] <doster504> @jacksawjack yesterday
[0:27:50] <ape_hawk> @jacksawjack yes
[0:27:57] <%imthewisejanitor> "The damage. The baby."
[0:28:06] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt I'd really like to see someone go through this game with absolutely maxed stats weapons and armor and see if this game can really be outleveled
[0:28:13] <doster504> @jacksawjack wait no he did that area proper a while ago he just ended up back there yesterday
[0:28:15] <ape_hawk> a fire monk is called a "funk"
[0:28:19] <Augus7717> what do you think they will nerf first in a future patch? mimi tear summon or some spells?
[0:28:24] <+LandOfTheWay> shields really do seem crazy good in this game
[0:28:27] <%Felhad> Damage from regular ass enemies is so busted for the rest of the game
[0:28:30] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> you'd still die in 2 hits
[0:28:40] <+furiousfurioso> it's a bit tough to get excited for ashes once you have mimic and tiche
[0:28:57] <%luftraumm1> seems optional
[0:28:57] <+dudlerand> there are definitely areas that will destroy you at max level
[0:28:58] <$SGrim> Optional
[0:28:58] <+alphonseisbest> yea EVEN AT 99VIT U WILL BE 3 SHOT
[0:28:58] <it_came_from_outer_space> seems optional by virtue of no boss
[0:28:59] <doster504> Shields are only good if you have barricade which is in some missable night boss lol
[0:29:00] <it_came_from_outer_space> or lever
[0:29:01] <oda_flobunaga> its optional
[0:29:08] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> bloodhound step breaks the game more than anything
[0:29:21] <+zaradax95> zaradax95 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! i dont watch often but its always great to watch my favorite streamer playing such a great game
[0:29:24] <%Felhad> "maxed stats armor" isnt really a thing either
[0:29:33] <critfumble_> @doster504 you can also get it from the tortoise shield
[0:29:34] <%greasypete00> can you go even further down on that elevator
[0:29:35] <+LandOfTheWay> i honestly assume everyone using a shield uses barricade
[0:29:38] <%luftraumm1> and what with soft caps it really seems to be non overlevelable
[0:29:40] <+GuildmasterAhnonay> the best part about this game is that it feels like EVERYTHING is broken
[0:29:49] <Augus7717> is that the one where you do a teleport slash forward?
[0:29:56] <+GuildmasterAhnonay> like it doesnt matter what you want to go for, you CAN get super busted
[0:29:57] <+dudlerand> barricade is really good but shields are still only applicable to some bosses
[0:30:00] <urkleturtle> the weapon art of blasphemous blade has pretty much become my "i win" button
[0:30:10] <doster504> @doster504 I still don't know where to get that I've almost 100% the game
[0:30:12] <%MaybeFalco> or no skill
[0:30:16] <@Spydurman> Spydurman is gifting 1 Tier 1 Subs to PatStaresAt's community! They've gifted a total of 1 in the channel! 
[0:30:16] <@Spydurman> Spydurman gifted a Tier 1 sub to Kingkaiju0618! 
[0:30:17] <%zaradax95> i parry just to try, im garbage at it
[0:30:18] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> bloodhound step is the dagger quickstep with intangibility zapping frames
[0:30:18] <sundizzle> nah, I put "no skill" on mine and was using all my cool weapon arts
[0:30:18] <%Nobrev> im still rocking no skill on my shield
[0:30:25] <%Danitaras> will Pat be keeping this new scheduled or is it for Eldan Ring only?
[0:30:25] <Giztech> i just use it to block and use my weapon art instead
[0:30:28] <+LandOfTheWay> i figured if you're a parry god you'd use something lighter, like a fist
[0:30:28] <%luftraumm1> ppl were defending no skill > barricade on woolie's chat
[0:30:31] <+GuildmasterAhnonay> I just keep turtle shield on my back and two hand
[0:30:32] <%Felhad> The most cheese weapon art by far us Hoarfrost Stomp and it's not even close
[0:30:34] <Nurdock> You MONSTER
[0:30:35] <%furiousfurioso> for the longest time I had no skill shield with moonviel cause the moonveil skill is so good
[0:30:36] <Augus7717> or you dont know about those options and just use a shield like you did in DS1
[0:30:37] <DensityD> LUL
[0:30:39] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt As a sorcerer with the moonlight I use the no skill on my greatshield
[0:30:48] <bobxmaker> i'm not really surprised, there is busted things in a souls game that makes the content trivial, now if you're a real G you intentionally nerf yourself.
[0:30:48] <doster504> no skill is good until the last 10%
[0:30:51] <urkleturtle> oh, it's THIS dungeon
[0:30:55] <%zaradax95> i just find it enjoyable to find out what i can and cant parry
[0:31:00] <$SGrim> No, not Alexander 3.0
[0:31:00] <DensityD> memories of small mushrooms
[0:31:02] <Zourath> @furiousfurioso Yeah, the perfumer one that applies a defensive buff was kind of exciting, until I realized I could equip that perfume, and my mimic would use it without consuming it.
[0:31:06] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> its like how the improved dodge abilities in monster hunter is one of the strongest things
[0:31:11] <Augus7717> memories of PAIN
[0:31:14] <sundizzle> i used no skill for a while and then eventually moved onto dual wielding scythes
[0:31:28] <%greasypete00> spook the giefer
[0:31:33] <atlasdotwav> visions of Sen's
[0:31:36] <Solvari> gief spooked
[0:31:40] <%BlueLunecy> I used barricade for one specific boss and dual wielded otherwise
[0:31:50] <%Bluwizard21> Fighting a black blade assassin to get his black blade I have noticed there is noone in the armor
[0:31:54] <%luftraumm1> that guy was hard to hit
[0:31:57] <%radiorosewater> thats a dog
[0:32:03] <DensityD> memories of brume tower
[0:32:04] <sapphomet777> yall im liking being an underleveled lymgrave zoomer
[0:32:15] <sapphomet777> but i cant WAIT to fuck margit
[0:32:43] <+Cityscape17> are mimics in this game?
[0:32:51] <SQDizzy> there was 1 guy
[0:32:52] <+Chosington> 1 jarry boi
[0:32:52] <%luftraumm1> noone and nothing
[0:32:55] <%Pookiedaexzile> yes
[0:32:55] <SQDizzy> that counts
[0:32:57] <eleskei> lil babby pot
[0:32:58] <%Felhad> No mimics
[0:32:59] <%zaradax95> not that im aware
[0:32:59] <Augus7717> yes and they are your best friends
[0:33:02] <%Felhad> only Brazil
[0:33:06] <JoshyJay> that jar is a person man D:
[0:33:09] <Nurdock> This one is SO long
[0:33:10] <%Aeoneth> @sapphomet777 You mean in a fight right?
[0:33:15] <Solvari> you can't talk about the pot boi like that pat
[0:33:18] <+ReallyBigRocks> squirtin
[0:33:18] <eleskei> poppa pot
[0:33:19] <sundizzle> just squirtin
[0:33:26] <mrcelab> hehe, he said squirts..
[0:33:28] <eleskei> chodes
[0:33:29] <%greasypete00> did you know if you toxic these poison squirts they fucking explode
[0:33:31] <Augus7717> if you poison those pods they explode @PatStaresAt
[0:33:32] <atlasdotwav> and fartin
[0:33:35] <%zaradax95> man poison is so underwhelming in this game
[0:33:48] <%Felhad> squirting
[0:33:58] <eleskei> mommy pot
[0:34:05] <DensityD> dungeon complete?
[0:34:11] <%rkbinder> rkbinder subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 18 months! 
[0:34:20] <+Chosington> The virgin poison versus the chad Scarlet rot
[0:34:20] <JoshyJay> rot monkaS
[0:34:22] <oda_flobunaga> But, Poison+ Rot is Godlike
[0:34:28] <RubberFistFight> Pat didn't go behind The Scary Door yet, did he?
[0:34:32] <Augus7717> rot FUCKS
[0:34:32] <%Valdorick> Poison sucks, heavy poison is good, scarlet rot is cheating and I love it.
[0:34:38] <%zaradax95> theres just scarlet rot and worse scarlet rot if you ask me
[0:34:44] <%Valdorick> Heavy Poison is so rare though.
[0:34:44] <%Aeoneth> It feels like there's 2 stages of each status. Poison which is later upgraded to Rot Bleed which is later "upgraded" to Frostbite
[0:34:45] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> what damage type is tiche's projectile?
[0:34:55] <Solvari> speaking of frames, is Pat playing it on PC or PS5?
[0:34:55] <mrcelab> follow the sound?
[0:34:56] <sundizzle> no levers?
[0:35:00] <BYAKURENLOVER763> they dont know about death
[0:35:05] <doster504> @Solvari PS5

[0:35:09] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt remember that side tomb?
[0:35:11] <%Aeoneth> And then Madness > Death
[0:35:16] <Solvari> @Solvari gotcha
[0:35:18] <%Felhad> Where's the lever Pat
[0:35:21] <%Monkeyweed21> the real lever was the friends we made along the way
[0:35:23] <%Wrashis> Wrashis subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 53 months! 53 months of pat stares at elden ring while dog gets silenced in the background. im personally not a fan of the doggo silencer because it cuts out parts of your belly laughs and they give me life. but i mean i like doggo noise so I'm not who its for.
[0:35:24] <%zaradax95> i dont think i actually have been here

[0:36:14] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt Also the first elevator has a secret underneath it
[0:36:17] <doster504> I got stuck in this catacomb for like 20 minutes I felt like somone slipped me drugs
[0:36:20] <%Felhad> WHERE'S THE LEVER PAT
[0:36:30] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> invading within these dungeons is a weird experience- getting just as lost as the hosts
[0:36:30] <+Freakin_Wolfy> wait, how did the dungeon gaslight pat?

[0:37:30] <doster504> @Wrashis he's found many
[0:37:30] <+Freakin_Wolfy> Now that pat said that we can finally figure out what's stronger? FromSoftware's level design or Pat's crazy talk.

[0:39:52] <%GodDougle> GodDougle subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 16 months, currently on a 16 month streak! 
[0:39:56] <+Shimano232> I petition to rename this dungeon to "Gas-light dungeon"

[0:41:08] <@Fuggins4U> you dyed
[0:41:10] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt hey pat I recently beat NG+ and I'm not ENTIRELY sure but I think NG is fucked, one of the optional areas seems to use the NG+ values for enemy damage
[0:41:15] <TwistParabola> LUL
[0:41:15] <RubberFistFight> @Chosington careful, don't get too close to criticising the game or the stans will get tilted.
[0:41:15] <%Daskolin> But Babba
[0:41:18] <RubberFistFight> :P
[0:41:20] <%zaradax95> ulcerated tree spirit seems to have a 50% chance for its ai to break at any given time
[0:41:23] <+Stormzcales_Lair> and now I barely laugh
[0:41:24] <Solvari> prehistoric LUL
[0:41:24] <%Pookiedaexzile> Cliffnotes you dead

[0:41:32] <+Stormzcales_Lair> belly laugh
[0:41:37] <+Freakin_Wolfy> pat can you open your map?
[0:41:43] <%zaradax95> its legit the only boss ive seen do that
[0:41:47] <%MaybeFalco> we take wins wear the AI breaks
[0:41:49] <%zaradax95> and multiple times
[0:41:58] <RubberFistFight> @zaradax95 that's because it's a lazy, shithouse enemy they didn't properly playtest and just copy-pasted all over the map for the sake of padding.
[0:41:59] <tanarath> f
[0:41:59] <doster504> I was on a cool ass secret boss and it's just turned off when it went into phase 2
[0:42:02] <@Fuggins4U> that was brutal
[0:42:07] <DensityD> you have been transported, like Seathe's archives??
[0:42:07] <%greasypete00> [ GASLIT ]
[0:42:14] <+Chosington> This game is a solid 9/10 with issues that put it away from a 10 COME AT ME STANS
[0:42:16] <Solvari> so much gas
[0:42:22] <%cade_calrayn> The secret boss of Farum Azula broke on me at 30% :(
[0:42:25] <@Fuggins4U> Beast Eye for the Elden Guy
[0:42:28] <doster504> @rosabellamelantha honestly the last 10% of the game feels like this to me
[0:42:29] <%MaybeFalco> !! GASLIGHT !!
[0:42:30] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> gaslighting is the latest soulsborne damage type
[0:42:33] <%Felhad> shyyFine
[0:42:40] <rosabellamelantha> @Chosington I can't haligtree is garbage
[0:42:40] <BigFingerRo> nobody light matches, all this gaslight makes it dangerous
[0:42:44] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> this is what's called a gaslight swamp
[0:42:47] <oda_flobunaga> I actually had one of the secret bosses break on me this morning.  I was spamming an incantation I got from a later story boss and this bosses second phase just broke and I got a free kill.
[0:42:53] <%Felhad> Where's the boss, Pat
[0:42:53] <BigFingerRo> Why are you the way that you are?
[0:42:59] <%Deft_Thought> Deft_Thought subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 46 months, currently on a 42 month streak! Hey Pat.
[0:43:01] <+Keiyum> no up only down
[0:43:05] <@Fuggins4U> y do birbs suddenly appear
[0:43:10] <RubberFistFight> @Chosington actually, I wouldn't put the game above a 6, due to numerous broken quests, the tiresome repeating of bosses, and various balance issues. Not saying it's not a good game, there's plenty of good in it. But man does it need some tweaking.
[0:43:14] <rosabellamelantha> @rosabellamelantha yeah I did some tests with a NG and NG+ file in haligtree and for some reason I actually take LESS damage in NG+ there
[0:43:19] <BigFingerRo> time for a gajillion buffs
[0:43:23] <BYAKURENLOVER763> another one!
[0:43:38] <+ratreborn> @RubberFistFight what quests are broken?
[0:43:41] <+Chosington> if I were a bit more critical I'd put it at an 8
[0:43:42] <%greasypete00> wow this one has some fuckin health
[0:43:44] <%cade_calrayn> Speak of the devil
[0:43:48] <doster504> @rosabellamelantha DMC 3 again huh?
[0:43:48] <BigFingerRo> this tree needs some ointment, or some pepto, jesus
[0:43:48] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> is tiche doing scarlot rot or another dmg type?
[0:43:49] <Solvari> yeyeye
[0:43:50] <critfumble_> YO THAT DOT IS FILTHY
[0:43:55] <critfumble_> WHAT THE HELL IS THAT
[0:44:02] <%cade_calrayn> @beatboxersdevmike special bleed
[0:44:07] <BYAKURENLOVER763> go get 'er tiche
[0:44:08] <oda_flobunaga> @BeatBoxersDevMike Tiche does the Rune of death
[0:44:09] <BYAKURENLOVER763> attagirl
[0:44:33] <Vyskus> Tiche does a dot that hit's for % of max health lol, it's nuts
[0:44:33] <Solvari> the DOT LUL
[0:44:36] <%Breaknoon> ggez
[0:44:36] <jubejube56> Ah I guess pay is using that incantation now
[0:44:37] <BigFingerRo> TWO TRIES
[0:44:39] <%Monkeyweed21> good job Tiche
[0:44:40] <+alphonseisbest> yo what's that claw attack @patstaresat is using?
[0:44:43] <TwistParabola> gg
[0:44:44] <DKDiamantes> Black Knife Tiche's DOT does WORK
[0:44:46] <sundizzle> yup
[0:44:51] <%zaradax95> are there more tree avatars or tree spirits?
[0:44:52] <eleskei> why does it have to look so fugly
[0:44:53] <RubberFistFight> @ratreborn I can't get festering fingerprint vyke OR revenger edgar to invade, despite having gotten both of those quests to the point where they should be - no steps missed or skipped. They've just stalled out. Pat is having the same problem with Vyke.
[0:44:54] <+Shimano232> @critfumble_  The DoT is coming from his spirit summon. the dagger it wields applies the DoT.
[0:44:55] <%luftraumm1> Butt Fuck It
[0:44:56] <%greasypete00> is that your final deathroot
[0:45:00] <TwistParabola> yayy deathroot
[0:45:02] <rosabellamelantha> @rosabellamelantha Yep, I didn't level up at all but I KNEW some bullshit was going on when I actually survived Malenias attack in NG+
[0:45:05] <critfumble_> that dot is disgusting
[0:45:09] <sundizzle> the bell-bearings come way too late for progress
[0:45:10] <oda_flobunaga> its the Rune of Death
[0:45:11] <BYAKURENLOVER763> thats death!
[0:45:18] <%Felhad> @alphonseisbest Blackflame Talons, you can see the name above Pat
[0:45:26] <DKDiamantes> The beefier the enemy, the better and better she becomes
[0:45:30] <+Chosington> black flame is nutso in this game, its why I use the black flame ritual on my faith build
[0:45:33] <doster504> @rosabellamelantha if that actually turns out to be an issue I want my playthrough back lol
[0:45:36] <%luftraumm1> oOoooO
[0:45:36] <Augus7717> 2 left
[0:45:36] <+Chosington> that spell is good Kreygasm
[0:45:37] <DensityD> zzzzin
[0:45:39] <RubberFistFight> @rosabellamelantha so Malenia is broken in NG? That doesn't surprise me at all and explains a great deal.
[0:45:43] <DensityD> stick
[0:45:45] <+DrFacilier> big bonk
[0:45:49] <BigFingerRo> BEASTCLAW GREATHAMMER OF THE BLOOD OF THE WOLF
[0:45:53] <DensityD> lemme smash
[0:45:57] <+booty_menace> I finished his stuff last night and you get cool stuff for it
[0:46:01] <BigFingerRo> MMMMMMYES
[0:46:08] <+FlappySeal_> Man, I accidentally aggro'd that guy when fighting the gargoyle outside and even with absolution, you can't reset his aggro. That was so frustrating
[0:46:12] <+Chosington> yeah I also finished this guy entirely
[0:46:15] <atlasdotwav> this game has so many str weapons
[0:46:22] <rosabellamelantha> @rosabellamelantha it seems like the entire haligtree is busted tbh
[0:46:30] <PenguinPall> 2
[0:46:30] <+ReallyBigRocks> just to be clear, you hit people with that?
[0:46:36] <+ratreborn> @FlappySeal_ that happens when u give him 4 death roots
[0:46:45] <+booty_menace> so much cool shit I cant use
[0:46:45] <sundizzle> @FlappySeal_ you sure you aggro'd him? there is a part of his quest where he just aggro's automatically
[0:46:45] <jubejube56> “This is my crystallian smashin stick”
[0:46:58] <atlasdotwav> he speaks the truth
[0:47:00] <rosabellamelantha> @rosabellamelantha yeah if I'm not just gaslighting myself or something I will genuinely be mad
[0:47:01] <%Nobrev> @FlappySeal_ Was it after you gave him 4 roots? he naturally aggros then and you have to beat him up a bit to calm him
[0:47:02] <%Hexidimentional> was that the gravewort bellbearing?
[0:47:07] <+Chosington> @FlappySeal_ yeah thats meant to happen, if you beat him down a certain amount he calms down
[0:47:07] <+FlappySeal_> @booty_menace @sundizzle ...oh. Oh well lmao
[0:47:07] <%AHomeschoolDropout> Started a dex build and I don't know if I wanna used curved greatswords, great piercing sword, or a funny flail I got
[0:47:11] <%cade_calrayn> @patstaresat there’s 9 Deathroot
[0:47:15] <+ratreborn> whack him a bit (if you can) and he calmcs donw
[0:47:18] <%zaradax95> ive had friend attack him, and he just reset after my friend died
[0:47:23] <sundizzle> @FlappySeal_ just smack him a few times, he'll calm down
[0:47:31] <%Felhad> Beat his ass til he cries
[0:47:33] <Elykial> have there been any weapon types that just plain suck yet?
[0:47:33] <oda_flobunaga> Well, day 1 balance in From games is always fucked.  Remember the Ringed City Angels?
[0:47:35] <+ReallyBigRocks> even the most obscure weapon types have like 3 or 4
[0:47:39] <DensityD> sekiro arm prosthetic?
[0:47:43] <RubberFistFight> @rosabellamelantha it really does. When the pissbabby trash mobs are hitting like a dump truck despite you being in heavy armor with 60 vit, something is absolutely wrong.
[0:47:45] <+FlappySeal_> @sundizzle Already on my third playthrough now, so he's back to normal anyway :P
[0:47:47] <sundizzle> yo you should go get that medallion
[0:47:47] <@Fuggins4U> Bionic Commando Paige seems nice.
[0:47:49] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> Spoilers
[0:47:49] <BYAKURENLOVER763> hehehehe
[0:47:50] <%Cozy90> It's a place
[0:47:51] <+Freakin_Wolfy> Pat shut up and go to the fort
[0:47:51] <+swesterly> he doesn't know
[0:47:51] <%Aeoneth> You'll find out
[0:47:52] <BYAKURENLOVER763> he's on the way there. to her
[0:47:53] <%zaradax95> a less biggerer tree
[0:47:54] <ape_hawk> wait, malenia or melina?
[0:47:54] <TwistParabola> a tree
[0:47:58] <+ReallyBigRocks> thats the thing the Albinauric dude was all about
[0:47:59] <PenguinPall> the other way
[0:47:59] <+Mrbaconator> you will find out
[0:48:02] <lyzejag> HE LACKS INFORMATION
[0:48:03] <Nordguy> it is a tree thst is holy
[0:48:05] <%Felhad> @elykial Whips are still weird
[0:48:06] <+FlappySeal_> It's a tree. But Halig.
[0:48:08] <sundizzle> do you have the first half?
[0:48:08] <%Cozy90> Pat doesn't know
[0:48:10] <%boggsz12> @ape_hawk she said melania
[0:48:11] <+Shimano232> Pat open your map and look at the very north of the island.
[0:48:13] <TwistParabola> 'Halig' means holy
[0:48:17] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt it's an optional zone that you can do to attain the "exit clause" for the ending you lock into by going through the Scary Door.
[0:48:20] <JoshyJay> he lackcs critcal information
[0:48:21] <+Mrbaconator> more like helags information
[0:48:23] <+booty_menace> a new challenger tree approaches
[0:48:24] <%Felhad> Go Haligtree
[0:48:24] <%cade_calrayn> It’s Miquella’s tree. Halig means holy
[0:48:25] <+ratreborn> jrsd
[0:48:27] <+ratreborn> jes*
[0:48:29] <+Freakin_Wolfy> Pat stop what you're doing and go to the cool ass fort
[0:48:29] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt its a *Spoiler* *Spoiler* where *Spoilers* Happen
[0:48:29] <Elykial> @Felhad man really? why cant they make fun useable whips...
[0:48:34] <%Mathochism> It's the opposite of Woolie Will Figure It Out.
[0:48:37] <TwistParabola> yup
[0:48:43] <jacksawjack> Pat doesn't know, don't be a Ph.D
[0:48:45] <%kknutson4> Did Pat botch any NPC questlines
[0:48:48] <%cade_calrayn> You can’t see it on the map yet, it’s one of the missing zones
[0:48:48] <+Mrbaconator> spoilers do indeed happen in that spoiler
[0:48:51] <+Cityscape17> Did you know you cant build up a status effect if you are on torrent? like walking through a swamp?
[0:48:53] <TwistParabola> LUL
[0:48:53] <rosabellamelantha> @rosabellamelantha Yeah that's the thing I only had 40 vig in both and in NG that would be near instant dead, in NG+ I can take like 4-5 hits from those big fuckers and be fine
[0:48:54] <%MaybeFalco> its the scrimbli bimblo
[0:48:56] <%Felhad> They aren't unusable, just not great
[0:49:01] <%sporeian94> Pat all I'm gonna say is if you go to The Haglitree, PREPARE TO GET YOUR SHIT PUSHE DIN
[0:49:01] <%Cozy90> I'm so pissed last night i jumped on an NPC and accidently killed them.
[0:49:03] <oda_flobunaga> More like Pat doesn't give two shits
[0:49:04] <lyzejag> PAT THE SCRUNCKLO
[0:49:06] <RubberFistFight> That's Captain Picard's approach lol.
[0:49:07] <T_Sasquatch> VVomen
[0:49:09] <sundizzle> pat do you have the first half of the secret medallion? i haven't been keeping up but it's very easily missable early in the game
[0:49:11] <%luftraumm1> Pat just doesn't Know, but Woolie is gonna figure it out
[0:49:12] <+booty_menace> big lies get the ladies
[0:49:16] <Elykial> thats just a tip for life, fake it til you make it.
[0:49:18] <+keiji_maede> CRAZY TALK, HUH?
[0:49:20] <%luftraumm1> VVymen
[0:49:22] <$SGrim> Nah, just GAslight
[0:49:23] <ape_hawk> and when she says she's fine after a huge fight, she's actually fine, dont do anything
[0:49:27] <+ReallyBigRocks> women love it when men act like they know a lot of things and explain them all
[0:49:28] <BigFingerRo> No, you should say "I never said that, you must be crazy"
[0:49:33] <%Aeoneth> All I will say is the payoff is worth it
[0:49:35] <%Freakin_Wolfy> Freakin_Wolfy subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months, currently on a 1 month streak! Pat go to the cool ass fort
[0:49:35] <BigFingerRo> ans just gaslight really hard
[0:49:36] <TwistParabola> sure is!
[0:49:37] <%Felhad> Manlying
[0:49:40] <pillowwasp> My go to is “of course”
[0:49:42] <Nordguy> wait there's two nedallions
[0:49:42] <lyzejag> You can also gaslight them, no maybe not
[0:49:44] <%AHomeschoolDropout> Do you have the albernaic woman ash summon? This is also a payoff for that Kappa
[0:49:45] <j_t_g_15> then she gets really SWEATY
[0:49:47] <+Mrbaconator> i got that medallion piece second LMAO
[0:49:50] <%zaradax95> doesnt the old dude say where to get the other half?
[0:49:56] <NewWillinium> Hey everyone, sorry I'm late had to deal with taking apart and back together again a couch and loveseat, what are we up to now?
[0:49:58] <Elykial> the correct answer to being called out is just shove the nearest food into your mouth and mumble a LOT until they give up
[0:49:58] <RubberFistFight> @ape_hawk y'know what? i actually agree with this. If she's not fine she should fucking say so instead of playing stupid shit-test mindgames.
[0:49:58] <Augus7717> did you exhaust millicents dialouge ?
[0:50:02] <TwistParabola> it'll be some time until you see Millicent again
[0:50:02] <sundizzle> I had to use an item that I had gotten literally 100 hours prior for a quest
[0:50:06] <oda_flobunaga> How may streams left for Pat to finish? My guess is 3 to 5
[0:50:14] <+TuskDeluxe> ha
[0:50:16] <it_came_from_outer_space> kinda
[0:50:16] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> its basically postgame
[0:50:17] <+booty_menace> he doesnt know
[0:50:19] <+ratreborn> if you go straight to story stuff it is
[0:50:21] <+Chosington> The dude that gives you the first half of the medallion never got to talk because the perfumer enemy close to it set the dude on fucking fire when he aggro'd
[0:50:21] <TwistParabola> it is.
[0:50:23] <%luftraumm1> the 80% mark?
[0:50:23] <Augus7717> yea
[0:50:24] <BigFingerRo> it feels end zone-y
[0:50:24] <%Aeoneth> That is a fair assumption
[0:50:25] <+ReallyBigRocks> you're in the final 150hrs for sure
[0:50:26] <+Chosington> in my game
[0:50:28] <%greasypete00> these merchants are fuckin wild man
[0:50:28] <R3Roundabout> does Pat know how to take down mausoleums?
[0:50:30] <it_came_from_outer_space> like its long but it does feel like a wind down
[0:50:31] <+TuskDeluxe> you would think that huh
[0:50:31] <RubberFistFight> @oda_flobunaga Easily unless he somehow dominates the Superboss.
[0:50:32] <%VictorVonLouche> Kinda
[0:50:33] <+beardy_foxbear> that's fair
[0:50:37] <+ratreborn> id say about the 80% mark
[0:50:40] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt there is a point of no return (for sidequests and stuff) coming up if you just b-line for the main story so
[0:50:40] <%Hexidimentional> someone explain tree ghosts to me
[0:50:43] <@Fuggins4U> its Jorgeous
[0:50:44] <%AHomeschoolDropout> it's more like Anor Londo in terms of placement
[0:50:44] <%cade_calrayn> It is, but the end is LONG
[0:50:47] <sundizzle> the area is also a little bit tighter than the plateau
[0:50:48] <NewWillinium> It's very Skyrimy with all of the Ruins scattered about
[0:50:48] <TwistParabola> you're about right
[0:50:49] <%Mathochism> Yeaaaaaah.
[0:50:49] <%Felhad> Only kind of wrong
[0:50:50] <Elykial> did the patches ever fix the performance?
[0:50:53] <%rkbinder> your about the half way point
[0:50:55] <ape_hawk> its bothering me that the trees arent connected to the ground
[0:50:57] <%radiorosewater> i know that you are definitely past the halfway point
[0:50:57] <tri3dgE027> Boy, VIDEO GAME awards gonna be real interesting this year, eh?  This game gonna take a good couple of chunk of the awards LuL
[0:50:58] <%Cozy90> Pat pro tip for the future. Don't jump on an NPC. It is possible to kill them just by jumping on them. i jsut did it last night
[0:51:02] <%greasypete00> lol
[0:51:03] <+ratreborn> LOL
[0:51:03] <%livi242> I'm glad to see the game's areas don't get worse as it gets on the end
[0:51:04] <%zaradax95> the last 2 zones are both beautiful
[0:51:05] <%Monkeyweed21> if Radahn is 50%, the capital is 75 to 80ish% through
[0:51:05] <sundizzle> good one
[0:51:06] <Elykial> LUL
[0:51:07] <%vivaldiva> LUL
[0:51:08] <+Chosington> Good one 4Head
[0:51:12] <@Fuggins4U> huehuehuehue
[0:51:12] <+swesterly> without spoilers you still have about a solid 4 zones left
[0:51:12] <jubejube56> I want to say it’s gorgeous but every tree looks like it is glitching
[0:51:15] <%luftraumm1> @Fuggins4U Jorgeous is a drag queen competing in drag race
[0:51:16] <%sporeian94> There's about 5 mandatory bosses left
[0:51:18] <+rbakervv> fucking patches
[0:51:19] <%MaybeFalco> you're about 20% through the game pat, this is only the first island
[0:51:20] <johnny_scissors> golem with the bitch ass ankles
[0:51:22] <RubberFistFight> @Cozy90 go get absolution, they'll respawn
[0:51:24] <+swesterly> so yeah beginning of end but it's a long long road ahead
[0:51:27] <%Felhad> Lol at Radahn being 50%
[0:51:27] <%Nobrev> get this dude off the stage
[0:51:32] <BYAKURENLOVER763> where IS patches anyway
[0:51:32] <%Freakin_Wolfy> Yeah, someone remember to remind Pat to not jump/fall on Malenia at the end of her quest
[0:51:33] <@Fuggins4U> @Fuggins4U oh i know. now... sashay away
[0:51:38] <DestroPrime83> Haha is funny
[0:51:39] <+ReallyBigRocks> he's only on the first continent Kappa
[0:51:44] <rosabellamelantha> @tri3dgE027 Devs and journalists super hate this game so I doubt it, there's a lot of legit anti japanese racism being thrown out over the game on twitter
[0:51:47] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt you haven't even been to Esos yet
[0:51:47] <%Cozy90> @RubberFistFight it was apart of a quest. I don't think they are coming bnack
[0:51:48] <Elykial> wow, big stabby.
[0:52:00] <NewWillinium> I feel safe to say that Radahn is about 35% of the way through the game
[0:52:03] <johnny_scissors> @fuggins4u hi fuggins
[0:52:05] <DensityD> juice me up
[0:52:06] <TwistParabola> oh neat

[0:52:19] <it_came_from_outer_space> *insert double tigers*
[0:52:22] <BigFingerRo> you didn't like the poison swamps?
[0:52:23] <%Freakin_Wolfy> This ice zone is amazing. The other one sucks, though
[0:52:25] <+ReallyBigRocks> I can't believe Pat hasn't even found the FTL drive yet Kappa
[0:52:25] <%zaradax95> you'll regret that statement
[0:52:26] <lyzejag> It's pretty good
[0:52:27] <urkleturtle> you didn't like horsecock valley?
[0:52:27] <%luftraumm1> @Fuggins4U a true lip sinc black knife assassin
[0:52:28] <+Cityscape17> imagine anor londo just showed up?
[0:52:29] <RubberFistFight> imagine if the fucking lightning deer from the bonus zone in DS2's DLC showed up.
[0:52:30] <+ratreborn> well when u compare it to the dogshit in Dark Souls 2 yes
[0:52:39] <johnny_scissors> it could be a hellzone you don't know
[0:52:42] <@Fuggins4U> @Fuggins4U many, many death drops, okurrr
[0:52:44] <NewWillinium> Horsecock Valley?
[0:52:48] <%Dunsparcetheglare> it's time for horsefuckvalley round 2
[0:52:48] <+FlappySeal_> I thought I was gonna hate this when you first have that misty area, just glad that was temporary
[0:52:50] <DestroPrime83> Hey pat what does the map look like so far? is it stupid huge
[0:52:50] <$HyperionXV> It's a million times better than horse relations valley
[0:52:52] <+booty_menace> HORSE DICK VALLEY IS ASS
[0:52:58] <%luftraumm1> horsecock valley is ok, worst problem is the beans
[0:52:59] <Solvari> YEP Horsecock Valley
[0:53:02] <+swesterly> that's what it's called though
[0:53:03] <%sporeian94> What about Bloodborne?
[0:53:06] <@Fuggins4U> I know nothing, Jon Horsecock
[0:53:07] <Elykial> someday i too will discover horse cock valley for myself
[0:53:09] <%Aeoneth> It's Ds2 isn't it
[0:53:09] <+TheBitingIrish> I am unaware
[0:53:09] <@Spydurman> Horsecock Vallussy?
[0:53:13] <jacksawjack> I call it Horse Fuck Valley
[0:53:15] <%Nobrev> all my homies hate horsecock valley

[0:53:20] <oda_flobunaga> Horse Smegma Flats
[0:53:26] <T_Sasquatch> @Spydurman ban yourself
[0:53:28] <%radiorosewater> it's probably DS2
[0:53:30] <+ReallyBigRocks> sometimes

[0:53:36] <NewWillinium> They absolutely will hit you more then once.
[0:53:38] <RubberFistFight> no it's fine just navigate through a complete whiteout while you're being tracked by multiple obscenely strong enemies who know exactly where you are at all times because the computer game is a cheating cunt Kappa
[0:53:39] <digaogrunge> Also, no actual horses in horsecock valley
[0:53:39] <TrollKing96> How do you think the balance of these Souls game would work with CRPG values?

[0:53:59] <+ReallyBigRocks> The Scarlet Rot ones will fuck you the fuck up
[0:54:01] <%MaybeFalco> @ape_hawk LUL

[0:54:56] <sundizzle> summon icon popped
[0:54:58] <NewWillinium> So what the heck is the Scarlet Rot? It was the curse of Malenia that erupted during her fight with Radahn, but what is it, why was she cursed with it, and why and HOW the fuck did it just explode outward like that?

[0:56:10] <+Chosington> this place sure is a place
[0:56:11] <oda_flobunaga> Oh, THIS fucking one
[0:56:11] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> this one is actually a fun one
[0:56:11] <%MaybeFalco> oh i remember this one
[0:56:12] <WeebFever> oh no
[0:56:18] <RubberFistFight> @Schrodingers_Box a couple. he still has haligtree and the spot behind the scary door to do. But everyone was screaming that going behind that door will fuck his save so i'm not sure if he will, despite that not being true.
[0:56:18] <%Cozy90> no
[0:56:19] <it_came_from_outer_space> i remember
[0:56:20] <it_came_from_outer_space> i like thosse
[0:56:21] <T_Sasquatch> literally no
[0:56:21] <%Felhad> Why was it, Pat?
[0:56:21] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> what's castlevania?
[0:56:23] <%sporeian94> PAT TUrN BACL
[0:56:25] <%Nobrev> no
[0:56:25] <%zaradax95> i only remember a netflix series
[0:56:26] <TwistParabola> no
[0:56:26] <@Fuggins4U> you mean Troidlikes?
[0:56:28] <Elykial> pat are you comparing this to SOTN because that is badass
[0:56:29] <ebrion> You even flip a tower
[0:56:29] <DestroPrime83> No
[0:56:30] <NewWillinium> Or. . Technically three. Did Pat go back to kill Blood Satan before I arrived?
[0:56:30] <+alphonseisbest> BLOODSTAINED is a thing
[0:56:30] <%greasypete00> every time LUL
[0:56:32] <Solvari> ah yes, it was 500 years ago
[0:56:34] <+beardy_foxbear> pat didn't get the cool castlevania whip right?
[0:56:35] <%imthewisejanitor> Remember Konami? Shame they died.
[0:56:35] <%MaybeFalco> LUL
[0:56:36] <lyzejag> lmao

[0:56:48] <+ReallyBigRocks> seek snail
[0:56:50] <Fien111> Old man yells at upsidedown castles
[0:56:55] <%cade_calrayn> @newwillinium her rune explains it -because Radagon and Marika are the same, their direct kids are fucked up. Miquella is permanently child and Malenia has the rot; it exploded because she was stabbed and lost control during the fight
[0:56:55] <+Schrodingers_Box> So Haligree and 3 Finger?
[0:57:00] <NewWillinium> I somehow missed this cave
[0:57:07] <%luftraumm1> Konami died so hard it is like it never was
[0:57:09] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt have you killed the real Mogh yet?
[0:57:12] <RubberFistFight> inaba? Oh no it's Adachi
[0:57:12] <Sunstalker> I can't beliieve the droprate talisman is stuck post capital but the rune talisman is just right there at caelid
[0:57:16] <%cade_calrayn> This cave sucks
[0:57:17] <TwistParabola> weeb alert
[0:57:23] <NewWillinium> Doesn't that NPC help you against Radahn?
[0:57:26] <+Schrodingers_Box> I also missed this Cave somehow
[0:57:26] <sundizzle> oda_flobunaga that's a spoiler
[0:57:32] <%greasypete00> i hate how those guys are called slugs when theyre clearly dogs
[0:57:33] <%luftraumm1> @oda_flobunaga only the mogh in the depths of the sewers
[0:57:36] <butthurtdave> Hey Pat, still getting caught up on your vods but I appreciate your streams and how you/chat clue me in on things I missed in my own playthrough.
[0:57:38] <%zaradax95> okina did
[0:57:38] <Fien111> Dweeb that Weeb npc
[0:57:40] <RubberFistFight> @Sunstalker a lot of the item distributions make zero sense
[0:57:41] <CashZen> Did Pat take Jellygirl to see her sister already?
[0:57:46] <%cade_calrayn> @sundizzle he’s fought both and beaten the sewer one
[0:57:47] <sundizzle> no, Okina helped you. that was a disciple of Okina
[0:57:48] <+TuskDeluxe> I love this cave because of several factors
[0:57:51] <oda_flobunaga> @sundizzle he's done the fight and died to him several streams ago
[0:57:56] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> maybe dont ask "hey has streamer seen ___ yet?"
[0:57:57] <+Schrodingers_Box> I Had Patches help me against Redahn....well kinda, he peaced out after looking at him
[0:57:58] <%luftraumm1> and you killed most of them @PatStaresAt
[0:58:01] <%RealThiele> that was Okinas bitch apprentice
[0:58:03] <%greasypete00> you also killed some of them
[0:58:06] <Saturation_Lizard> blaidd helped you fight radann :(
[0:58:08] <eleskei> how is a tree growing in a cave
[0:58:08] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt oh don't forget to go back to that blood palace and fight Literally Blood Satan at some point.
[0:58:08] <%Daskolin> Even Patches did 1 swing
[0:58:10] <sundizzle> oda_flobunaga cade_calrayn okay I retract my statement and look like a fool
[0:58:12] <butthurtdave> hey chat what sword is pat using
[0:58:13] <fluffyesttail> I just made it to Caelid and I haven't found any cool weapons yet.
[0:58:15] <%Monkeyweed21> SELUVIS HELPED YOU FIGHT RADAHN
[0:58:20] <ebrion> Boss fountain?
[0:58:27] <+ReallyBigRocks> did he?
[0:58:33] <%Aeoneth> Seluvis did?
[0:58:33] <athuramn> @beatboxersdevmike but then how will the people intentionally spoil while making it sound like a question?
[0:58:35] <TwistParabola> no?
[0:58:38] <+swesterly> @NewWillinium someone helping you previously doesn't mean you should allow them to attack you currently
[0:58:40] <Sunstalker> Seluvis? Wasn't that a different mage?
[0:58:40] <%zaradax95> one of his puppets was a summon yeah?
[0:58:42] <%Aeoneth> I don't recall ever seeing his summon sign
[0:58:43] <sundizzle> Seluvis controls a puppet lady in the fight
[0:58:44] <NewWillinium> I think Goat Man also helps you fight Radahn if you don't kill himm first
[0:58:49] <fluffyesttail> When should I expect to start finding cool weapons?
[0:58:53] <Fien111> "thanks in the fight, ASSHOLES! You guys were the key to my victory you FUCKING PRICKS"
[0:58:55] <TwistParabola> goat man definitely helps you
[0:58:56] <+ReallyBigRocks> oh that makes sense
[0:58:57] <TwistParabola> so does Lionel
[0:58:59] <%Monkeyweed21> Finger Maiden Therolina is one of his fuck puppets
[0:59:11] <Sunstalker> yeah the maiden but that's just the usual timeline is convuluted shit.
[0:59:11] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> every elden ring stream's chat has been the worst, and i'll gladly include myself in that
[0:59:12] <+Schrodingers_Box> So Pats done Blood Boy, Ranni Quest and Fia so far?
[0:59:19] <DensityD> looping
[0:59:23] <%TG_Cid11> @PatStaresAt There is now a sub 40 min run of Elden Ring
[0:59:24] <RubberFistFight> @Monkeyweed21 Finger maiden Kappa
[0:59:24] <Zourath> At least these ones don't seem to go intangible after summoning.
[0:59:26] <sirrice77> @fluffyesttail anywhere from immediately to a dozen hours in depending on where you go
[0:59:27] <NewWillinium> Can you actually *meet* Lionel ever? Or just find his armor and fight him at protecting Fia?
[0:59:28] <%Aeoneth> @Monkeyweed21 I don't like this revalation
[0:59:35] <%cade_calrayn> Back to the Grace Hole, Pat?
[0:59:43] <%RealThiele> i mean poop eater is still the worst but incel mage is pretty up there
[0:59:48] <%Monkeyweed21> @Aeoneth Seluvis is a fuckin creep man
[0:59:49] <fluffyesttail> Okay thanks @sirrice77
[0:59:52] <butthurtdave> Thanks for fighting that one dude at the bottom of that tower in Caelid, Pat.  I beat him last night and that sword is carrying me
[0:59:55] <%NBUsagi> did Pat already do the Ice Castle?
[0:59:57] <+TuskDeluxe> IT'S so pretty for something locked away
[1:00:00] <%luftraumm1> looks kind of zelda like
[1:00:05] <@Spydurman> like this underground grove
[1:00:06] <+TuskDeluxe> which makes the boss. greaaty
[1:00:08] <%AHomeschoolDropout> I can't name a game that isn't Dragon's Dogma that I find as fun to just explore the open world
[1:00:10] <%Aeoneth> Fuck I missed this dungeon
[1:00:10] <+Schrodingers_Box> Poop Boy's rune is a pain to get since those curses are ALL over the place.
[1:00:11] <rosabellamelantha> This game is SO PRETTY
[1:00:14] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt do you care about the sorcery trainer's quest?
[1:00:15] <+LandOfTheWay> @Monkeyweed21 seluvis is tied with mohg as the biggest creep in this game
[1:00:16] <NewWillinium> @NBUsagi . .Do you mean the Fort here? No
[1:00:16] <sundizzle> NBUsagi nah, he just got here and went south instead
[1:00:17] <%greasypete00> LUL
[1:00:20] <+beardy_foxbear> what about the loathsome dung eater?
[1:00:20] <NewHamwall> lmao
[1:00:21] <%luftraumm1> oh fuck
[1:00:21] <+ReallyBigRocks> :)
[1:00:21] <critfumble_> DOUBLEKO
[1:00:23] <%Valdorick> oof
[1:00:24] <Fien111> Pat is scraping a game meant to drive game scrapers to abject madness and still survives
[1:00:27] <tanarath> f
[1:00:29] <%zaradax95> now the snail will summon YOU
[1:00:37] <LMTTN> The sorcery trainer in Limgrave?
[1:00:38] <%imthewisejanitor> P o o p b o y r u n e s
[1:00:48] <%NBUsagi> Thank you @NewWillinium and @sundizzle <3
[1:00:52] <lyzejag> MMMH ?
[1:00:53] <%Aeoneth> She is sick indeed
[1:00:55] <rosabellamelantha> YEAH SHE SUCKS
[1:00:55] <%imthewisejanitor> Mary?
[1:00:55] <Yakobro> ??? she's really not that hard idk what people are doing
[1:00:57] <+Mrbaconator> I caved on that sick lady and respecced to bleed for her
[1:00:57] <+Schrodingers_Box> Oh Rotten Paige
[1:00:59] <%Cozy90> She can do some crazy ass shit
[1:01:00] <YokaiZee> millicent?
[1:01:01] <RubberFistFight> For that person who just made that message - that whole area is apparently broken and uses ng+ scaling in ng
[1:01:01] <+chaggles> she cool
[1:01:03] <@Spydurman> Paige?
[1:01:07] <+swesterly> damn i wonder what kind of tree a sick lady like that would live in
[1:01:08] <DensityD> scarlet rooooooot
[1:01:08] <Glockroach2774> Gonna grab some DRANK. Watching Pat while drunk is a national sport here
[1:01:11] <%JonathLP> @PatStaresAt Would you say incest is a superpower?
[1:01:11] <%crimsonharvest> oh is this the fucking ghost wolf zone
[1:01:13] <TwistParabola> LUL
[1:01:13] <oda_flobunaga> So yeah, Paige is actually in this game and its wild.
[1:01:13] <R3Roundabout> Ultra-Paige is a nightmare to fight
[1:01:14] <%MaybeFalco> the only boss i had to respec for
[1:01:15] <%Aeoneth> IT IS fucking Paige
[1:01:16] <+ReallyBigRocks> terrible Psoriasis
[1:01:16] <DensityD> sundowning
[1:01:17] <NewWillinium> She is *insanely* hard, ESPECIALLY that first phase
[1:01:18] <%RealThiele> paige gives you the mold and wins
[1:01:18] <%Freakin_Wolfy> Yeah, I have eczema and I can one shot everyone in my neighborhood
[1:01:19] <%zaradax95> i had to grind so hard for that boss i ended up stomping the final story bosses into dust
[1:01:21] <Solvari> monkaS NOT THE LUPUS
[1:01:21] <%AHomeschoolDropout> Her Attacks literally heal her for 200+ if she hits you, EVEN IF YOU BLOCK IT
[1:01:22] <%VictorVonLouche> Paige is pretty bullshit in that fight.
[1:01:24] <Saturation_Lizard> she is honestly not that bad, i was running a basic strength faith build and managed her in 7 tries
[1:01:26] <+Shimano232> I bet the skin lady on my 2nd try... But I was rocking 80int super spells soooo....
[1:01:27] <lyzejag> @RubberFistFight No fucking way
[1:01:27] <%Monkeyweed21> people are overstating it but it is hard as shit
[1:01:28] <PenguinPall> Mimic-chan will help you out
[1:01:29] <+Mrbaconator> she really IS ULTRA PAIGE
[1:01:30] <+Schrodingers_Box> I find it funny both Pat and Paige were put into this game as bosses
[1:01:30] <RubberFistFight> I wouldn't be surprised if it got hit with the nerf bat when Fromsoft make the first major patch.
[1:01:30] <sundizzle> I wanna believe that the area is using NG+ scaling but at the same time I believe its just meant to be omega fucking hard
[1:01:31] <%furiousfurioso> @Yakobro right? I got it in under 10 tries I think some builds are just hard countered there
[1:01:41] <Sunstalker> Where the hell does the Unaltered Banished Knight chest drop from?
[1:01:43] <RubberFistFight> @RubberFistFight rosabella was just talking about it.
[1:01:43] <+beardy_foxbear> shes so much harder than any other the mainline bosses after her
[1:01:47] <+Schrodingers_Box> Looking forward to Pat fighting Pat this stream.
[1:01:47] <@DakotaMacDoodle> She'll kick your dick in  more then once but its not that bad
[1:01:49] <+TheBitingIrish> Chat, is there no fire whetblade?
[1:01:49] <%RealThiele> Ultra instinct paige LUL
[1:01:52] <NewWillinium> Especially because in addition to her skin disease powers, she ALSO  has that Boss Healing bug that some of the others do. Specifically *bug* not her gimmick
[1:01:53] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 20 months! Orb
[1:01:54] <%Zundelle> nah she's cool
[1:01:54] <+ReallyBigRocks> Don't forget, Pat is a god gamer
[1:02:00] <+swesterly> @Monkeyweed21 idk man she's literally the hardest boss in the series imo
[1:02:01] <%zaradax95> the one move though
[1:02:04] <oda_flobunaga> There is a fire whetblade
[1:02:05] <TwistParabola> Ultra instinct paige is my favorite way of referring to her
[1:02:10] <%cade_calrayn> Malenia really is Paige. Built like glass, hits like a truck, red haired, hot, and has a skin thing
[1:02:11] <RubberFistFight> wait wait boss healing "bug"?
[1:02:11] <urkleturtle> that lady is still super easy to cheese with mimic, because mimic is dumb. i beat her on my second try
[1:02:12] <RubberFistFight> what bug
[1:02:12] <critfumble_> i saw brozime cheese the fuck out of her with mimics and powerwave sword
[1:02:13] <+Mrbaconator> i struggled on her and the final boss more than the others
[1:02:16] <critfumble_> youll be fine
[1:02:19] <RubberFistFight> since she has a mechanic based around lifesteal
[1:02:19] <+swesterly> Punished Paige
[1:02:19] <TwistParabola> bug?
[1:02:19] <Fien111> There's a lady that is The Psoriasis and she is UPSET
[1:02:22] <%furiousfurioso> I'm pretty sure that's exactly her gimmick lmao
[1:02:24] <Solvari> O R B
[1:02:25] <+TuskDeluxe> words spoken
[1:02:30] <+ZaheerMyHomeBoy> Who is that you're talking about?
[1:02:30] <+FlappySeal_> Famous last words
[1:02:32] <%luftraumm1> well every game introduces at least ONE boss that is the hardest its ever been
[1:02:36] <+beardy_foxbear> she was hard for my high end tanking build
[1:02:38] <dirtyswampman> its def not a bug thats one of her mechanics
[1:02:39] <%cade_calrayn> It’s not a bug, that’s her gimmick
[1:02:41] <Saturation_Lizard> that healing thing is NOT a bug, it happens when you use tiche because her knife reduces enemy max HP and then gives it back after a while
[1:02:42] <NewWillinium> @RubberFistFight Where Bosses, even those without gimmicks, will just regain chunks of their health for no reason. I've had it happen with most of the major boss fights in the game
[1:02:43] <DestroPrime83> Who was the skin lady i havent seen a couple streams
[1:02:44] <jubejube56> I’ve only ever seen footage of that boss getting extremely cheesed
[1:02:44] <oda_flobunaga> Are people reporting the bug using Tiche or the Black Dagger.  Because if so, then its not a bug
[1:02:45] <DensityD> illusory floor ahead
[1:02:47] <+Schrodingers_Box> Those Godskin are a pain since their AI auto throws that fireball if you try and si[
[1:02:48] <Fien111> Great start
[1:02:49] <%Valdorick> She heals while hitting dying entities, is the real bug.
[1:02:55] <%AHomeschoolDropout> I was doing a black flame build and boy is that fun
[1:02:57] <%Monkeyweed21> @swesterly oh yea shes hard as shit but the talk of her being "unbeatable with certain builds" or having "undodgeable" attacks is just salt
[1:03:00] <RubberFistFight> @furiousfurioso eh, she does it whether you're blocking or not which kinda makes no sense. She shouldn't be able to steal your life if you have a 100% reduction shield.
[1:03:06] <T_Sasquatch> wtf is that claw attack
[1:03:12] <RubberFistFight> @RubberFistFight HOLY FUCK I THOUGHT I WAS IMAGINING THAT
[1:03:12] <%NBUsagi> Yooo Pat has blood magic
[1:03:14] <T_Sasquatch> god this game is hot with the magi shit
[1:03:17] <RubberFistFight> IM NOT CRAZY
[1:03:21] <+FlappySeal_> Has anyone officially confirmed it's a bug or are some players just on mad copium?
[1:03:23] <RubberFistFight> well... i am crazy but not about that specifically.
[1:03:26] <+ReallyBigRocks> fuck blood magic, throw rocks
[1:03:29] <%greasypete00> big rocks make big damage
[1:03:29] <+Schrodingers_Box> UI Paige Boss is also a pain due to summons being a liability on her.
[1:03:32] <@Spydurman> rocks rock rocks
[1:03:32] <DensityD> bendy boy
[1:03:34] <%livi242> I feel like it's copium
[1:03:35] <+ScrapKingKeita> that throw move really rocks, huh?
[1:03:38] <%Hexidimentional> i hate how noodly he is
[1:03:44] <ArOne_Start> chuck rock
[1:03:46] <DestroPrime83> wow that just straight wiffed
[1:03:48] <%zaradax95> damn i didnt know eye lazers were a thing
[1:03:49] <urkleturtle> i love the godskin dudes' boss theme so much
[1:03:50] <%RealThiele> stretch armstrong
[1:03:53] <+ReallyBigRocks> hahaha
[1:03:56] <+Chosington> whirlwind beats rock
[1:03:57] <%Maids4lyfe> he's like that one dude from street fighter
[1:03:57] <NewWillinium> I mean I've beaten her, and seen the bug happen with Rykard, and and Radahn as well
[1:03:58] <%luftraumm1> talk shit get juiced
[1:04:02] <%Zundelle> hahahaha! oh no!
[1:04:03] <%Valdorick> Why would you taunt Crazy Talk like that by laughing?
[1:04:04] <Solvari> careful, crazy talk is still active
[1:04:14] <+FlappySeal_> PopCorn
[1:04:15] <Yakobro> 278 LUL
[1:04:19] <sundizzle> ngl that red lightning spell SUCKS
[1:04:20] <Solvari> LUL
[1:04:21] <NewWillinium> FUCK Faith spells are so Flashy in this game
[1:04:22] <%RealThiele> wow tiche ate shit to him
[1:04:24] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> Now do it again
[1:04:26] <%Valdorick> Oh shit, did he kill Tiche?
[1:04:27] <WeebFever> DO IT AGAIN
[1:04:27] <+TuskDeluxe> lmao
[1:04:28] <TwistParabola> Crazy Talk, Activate!
[1:04:28] <$ShadowZiggy> Got cocky lol
[1:04:30] <+ReallyBigRocks> :)
[1:04:30] <it_came_from_outer_space> LUL
[1:04:30] <%Valdorick> THAT'S GONNA SUCK
[1:04:31] <sundizzle> OH YOU THOUGHT
[1:04:31] <+booty_menace> LUL
[1:04:31] <valstriam> LUL
[1:04:32] <%VictorVonLouche> AHahhaha
[1:04:32] <MoonObscure> LOL
[1:04:32] <%boggsz12> lmao
[1:04:32] <+LandOfTheWay> LUL
[1:04:34] <%furiousfurioso> I can't help but feel jumping to calling "bug" is a bit premature
[1:04:36] <%JonathLP> He doesn't know
[1:04:37] <narusao> LUL
[1:04:37] <oda_flobunaga> SO, THE WAY BLACK FLAME WORKS/ the RUNE OF DEATH is that it reduces total health for a certain amount of time but that reduction reverses after like 20 seconds.  It makes it look like the boss regains health, which technically they are doing.  But, it is a feature, not a bug.
[1:04:37] <%Zundelle> yeah fuck you
[1:04:37] <Solvari> Pat it's not a player
[1:04:37] <%MaybeFalco> LUL
[1:04:40] <+TuskDeluxe> what you get for teabaging lmao
[1:04:42] <Fien111> Round Two.....FIGHT
[1:04:43] <%RealThiele> PHASE 2
[1:04:43] <+Schrodingers_Box> I beat her with Mimic Tear alternating hits with Colossal swords to perm stun her
[1:04:44] <RubberFistFight> @livi242 loads of other stuff in the other games got originally dismissed as "salty gamerbro copium" before it turned out they were actual bugs or oversights, so i feel it's a bit unfair to dismiss this since it's being consistently complained about from what I can gather.
[1:04:45] <@Fuggins4U> is it just me or did that sith lightning have zero range?
[1:04:46] <+izanagi22> Well that's just rude
[1:04:46] <+ReallyBigRocks> ooh he's blubbery
[1:04:49] <whimwhisp> What level is pat now anyway?
[1:04:49] <johnny_scissors> more of these godskin freaks lol
[1:04:52] <Solvari> monkaS ORB BOSS
[1:04:52] <lyzejag> HE LACKS CRITICAL INFORMATION
[1:04:52] <%Valdorick> They're ghosts, by the way. Immune to Rot
[1:04:55] <Butch_DeLoria> Overconfidence is a very fast, insidious killer
[1:04:55] <+CatRidder> fight all the foreskin guys
[1:04:55] <%Aeoneth> Crazy Talk  used 2nd Sentance.  It's effect now works on time delay
[1:04:58] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> I don't think you can give aids to ghosts
[1:04:58] <TheBlankAce> And they can't be decayed
[1:05:00] <%RealThiele> yea the lightning sweep is very close range
[1:05:02] <BYAKURENLOVER763> i hate these guys
[1:05:03] <HotSauceFiend> I gotta ask, are there bosses that Pat has gotten absolutely stuck on for a while. I just pop in and out with these elden ring streams
[1:05:05] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> you cannot defeat the ORB
[1:05:08] <sundizzle> Fuggins4U it has piss range and does way less damage than most spells like it
[1:05:09] <fluffyesttail> Beanpole ahead, and then prepare for fatty
[1:05:11] <%NBUsagi> Im so interested in the lore of the Godskin and why they are mutant freaks
[1:05:13] <%Deft_Thought> Man, these dudes are gross
[1:05:20] <rosabellamelantha> @sundizzle I could just be completely wrong but like I GENUINELY take less damage on NG+ in haligtree
[1:05:21] <NewWillinium> @oda_flobunaga Except I was fighting them with Lhutel, not Tiche. And Luhtel does not have that ability
[1:05:23] <%Freakin_Wolfy> they're not ghosts, they're ILLUSIONS, michael
[1:05:36] <sundizzle> Fuggins4U also has a long startup timer that you can be smacked out of really easily
[1:05:38] <+swesterly> @NBUsagi they wear rykards shedded skin
[1:05:46] <%Zundelle> yeah I'm a big not fan of that red lightning
[1:05:47] <oda_flobunaga> @NewWillinium were you using any Black flame?
[1:05:56] <NewWillinium> Question. Are the Godskin Nobles Demi-Humans? Why does he have a tail?
[1:05:57] <sundizzle> rosabellamelantha I haven't tried NG+ myself but that's crazy
[1:06:00] <TwistParabola> F
[1:06:07] <NewWillinium> @oda_flobunaga Nope. Mage build. using the Cold Naginata
[1:06:08] <%RealThiele> him rolling in here is awful
[1:06:12] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> linguine and meatball
[1:06:13] <%NBUsagi> @NBUsagi OH, like form his snake body in the Volcano? 0w 0
[1:06:22] <ergulor> snails
[1:06:24] <WeebFever> You have to kill both in a row and then the snail spawns out of thin air, there's no secret
[1:06:26] <+Schrodingers_Box> Are people going to spoil him on how to get to the dragon in last area?
[1:06:29] <+CatRidder> kill the summoner?
[1:06:34] <Fien111> That dude looks like a lump of literal cancer flesh and I don't like it
[1:06:36] <@QueequegTheater> @Schrodingers_Box No.
[1:06:37] <+FlappySeal_> yeeeah, getting back to that boss when you die is a pain in the ass
[1:06:38] <oda_flobunaga> Okay @NewWillinium Yeah, problem in need of fixing
[1:06:42] <+BloodyBurney> do you wanna know?
[1:06:42] <@QueequegTheater> If he asks, I will tell him
[1:06:44] <Augus7717> they are but the snail wont show up until you kill both in a row
[1:06:46] <%greasypete00> is it on the ceiling
[1:06:48] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> nopw
[1:06:49] <%RealThiele> if you can kill the snail that summoned them first lemme know i just fought them all
[1:06:49] <TheBlankAce> Its just a small boss rush
[1:07:01] <%Valdorick> Come on Chat, don't tell him that, let him work it out and die trying to find something he can't.
[1:07:02] <TwistParabola> dw just kill them
[1:07:02] <+ReallyBigRocks> Godskin Snail
[1:07:04] <+Schrodingers_Box> Ok, yeah was worried since how easy it is to miss content in this
[1:07:05] <%TG_Cid11> no its an endurance fight
[1:07:12] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> chat's the worst
[1:07:14] <TioXyco> are you going in circles?
[1:07:15] <RubberFistFight> @sundizzle I think you're onto something. That area and the boss of it are being called out for a very specific and consistent group of things. There is a very perceptible jump in damage output from even the basic mobs like those little dooters, or the demihumans with daggers.
[1:07:20] <rosabellamelantha> @sundizzle it's very crazy and I'm like 99% sure it's a bug, I even explored around a lot to get the platinum trophy
[1:07:21] <%crimsonharvest> i lamestomped the noble out just tired of fighting that guy
[1:07:24] <NewHamwall> No there isn't
[1:07:26] <+Rofiarf> naah
[1:07:27] <Ethel9727> There is no secret
[1:07:28] <ape_hawk> the secret is you shouldve recruited grumblo
[1:07:28] <oda_flobunaga> No there ain't
[1:07:29] <+TuskDeluxe> just fight them
[1:07:30] <+BloodyBurney> no secret, just murder harder
[1:07:32] <+Rofiarf> just keep fighting
[1:07:32] <Ethel9727> Just beat them both, it sucks
[1:07:33] <Saturation_Lizard> there is no secret, its just one after the other
[1:07:34] <Wakerz140> No secret
[1:07:34] <+FlappySeal_> Nope
[1:07:34] <%TG_Cid11> no just fight
[1:07:36] <TwistParabola> just kill them
[1:07:36] <Solvari> kill or be killed
[1:07:41] <%Valdorick> There is no trick to the fight, just fight it out.
[1:07:41] <Augus7717> no secret just murder
[1:07:45] <Fien111> Git Gud
[1:07:46] <+BoboDaHobo> the secret is that when they have 0 health you'll win
[1:07:53] <%crimsonharvest> big shields big wins
[1:07:54] <RubberFistFight> just lame it out like cross tekken
[1:08:02] <%Felhad> yes
[1:08:04] <+BloodyBurney> love the godskin theme tho
[1:08:07] <+TuskDeluxe> the secret is that hitting them deals damage
[1:08:10] <%TarikBot> Is the boss fight music slightly distorted and disturbing in this fight or is that just a sound issue because its sounds awesome
[1:08:18] <+xerj> Sacrifice your spirits for more time on the clock
[1:08:26] <+ZaheerMyHomeBoy> runes?
[1:08:32] <NewWillinium> I think that's a sound issue @TarikBot
[1:08:39] <%greasypete00> this song is really fuckin good
[1:08:44] <%furiousfurioso> @TarikBot if you're on low latency mode that's probably that
[1:08:56] <+BloodyBurney> twitch sound fucks up sometimes, gets warbly, reload the tab or pause for a bit and it should be fixed
[1:09:04] <RubberFistFight> @rosabellamelantha like, that flurry attack she does, the really big one. That is reliably killing people after 2 hits and yet it goes on much, much, MUCH longer than that. Why? Seems pointless to program that all in if you're only ever gonna be subject to less than half of it. But if her damage output is broken, it would make a lot more sense.
[1:09:05] <+ReallyBigRocks> I hate his stretchy shit
[1:09:06] <Fien111> It's always great when an enemy attack hits and you have SIX status build-ups on screen
[1:09:11] <NewWillinium> . . Oh hey was that the equivalent of the Spin Weapon Weapon Art? Is that thing actually good because it looks like the Boss Shreds with it
[1:09:18] <%TarikBot> I prefer it this way
[1:09:20] <Solvari> monkaS Luffy
[1:09:28] <%radiorosewater> fuckin stylish
[1:09:29] <%crimsonharvest> no mames
[1:09:31] <+Schrodingers_Box> You can cheese her with Ultra Poise builds
[1:09:37] <%Hexidimentional> ugh so noodly
[1:09:37] <%luftraumm1> dodge into the spinny
[1:09:49] <%Pookiedaexzile> Now Again
[1:09:49] <rosabellamelantha> @RubberFistFight Yeah on NG+ even when it did kill me I lived through the first 2 parts of the combo reliably then died to the third
[1:09:49] <+Schrodingers_Box> In had the Goat Armor with Fingerprint Shield for UI Paige boss
[1:09:56] <%Pookiedaexzile> but fat
[1:10:00] <RubberFistFight> @rosabellamelantha compare it to bosses like manus or midir or even gael who all have long combo strings, but the entirety of which only really do maybe 3/4 to 4/5 of your health bar.
[1:10:03] <+ReallyBigRocks> when the creepy skin man leans towards you and then just keeps leaning towards you
[1:10:05] <%zaradax95> cheesing a boss shouldnt feel almost necessary
[1:10:07] <%NBUsagi> fat powers
[1:10:07] <+Schrodingers_Box> I could just Block it
[1:10:15] <it_came_from_outer_space> @RubberFistFight actually you can tank a lot more hits
[1:10:18] <%furiousfurioso> I can't help but wonder if people just have the soreseals on during that area, I took that off and put on the damage mitigation talismans and was totally fine
[1:10:22] <it_came_from_outer_space> you just need to wear super heavy armor
[1:10:23] <%MaybeFalco> @TarikBot if you also have the frankerz addon, there's an option that speeds up the stream if you get behind, that can also cause it
[1:10:23] <Fien111> I know there's no way every boss has a unique theme but just how many boss themes are in this game?
[1:10:24] <heartlesshealer> oh fuck yeah, Pat's in this cave
[1:10:30] <%Dakuu75> Woah, fat-evil
[1:10:34] <+ReallyBigRocks> ez
[1:10:36] <Solvari> jesus
[1:10:44] <it_came_from_outer_space> havel strats still work in this game
[1:10:45] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> the ORB is defeated
[1:10:50] <%Zundelle> I love just throwing a bunch of rocks
[1:10:51] <%Dakuu75> Lol
[1:10:53] <RubberFistFight> @rosabellamelantha Malenia's flurry, on the other hand, is a guaranteed death sentence. So is her phase 2 opener if you don't manage to evade it which seems largely luck-based since she tracks you across the arena.
[1:10:54] <%Pookiedaexzile> Anotha One
[1:10:57] <+Schrodingers_Box> One thing i am dissapointed with in Elden Ring. Is that there are no tails to cut off.
[1:10:57] <%TG_Cid11> That was pat's final form
[1:11:04] <NewHamwall> You found the snail :)
[1:11:06] <@Spydurman> LUL
[1:11:06] <+ReallyBigRocks> Godshell Snailpostle
[1:11:11] <heartlesshealer> Snail summoner <3
[1:11:13] <+Schrodingers_Box> No Pats Final Form is on this Mountain
[1:11:14] <%Willowight> a snail?
[1:11:16] <NewWillinium> Ooh! New Incatation?
[1:11:16] <TwistParabola> ty tiche
[1:11:17] <lethallylactic> Was that thing just there invisible the whole time?
[1:11:19] <%YakumoYomi> DansGame
[1:11:19] <sundizzle> yo black flame ritual is so good
[1:11:20] <TwistParabola> LUL
[1:11:22] <+Schrodingers_Box> Its a really hot one.
[1:11:24] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> that one is pretty good
[1:11:25] <heartlesshealer> YEAH LOOK AT IT PAT
[1:11:27] <%Eldalu> omg gross
[1:11:28] <Gray_LoFi> Love that Tiche was just ON murdering that snail
[1:11:28] <$OfficerMods> man wouldn't it suck to fight those again
[1:11:31] <+swesterly> definitely feels like maybe some of the 85 bosses were designed with spirit summons in mind
[1:11:31] <NewWillinium> Ooooohhhh. Black Flame Firestorm
[1:11:31] <%MaybeFalco> insanely good talisman btw
[1:11:34] <%luftraumm1> empyrean like ranni?
[1:11:36] <+ReallyBigRocks> Kreygasm the gloaming
[1:11:40] <Solvari> DansGame eat it
[1:11:40] <RubberFistFight> The fact that you have to respec into what are essentially heavy cheese builds just to stand a CHANCE at beating her obviously points to something being amiss. No other boss in the entire Fromsoft catalogue has required that.
[1:11:42] <%TG_Cid11> Bloodborne talisman
[1:11:44] <rosabellamelantha> @RubberFistFight I can dodge her phase 2 opener pretty consistently but that bullshit anime phantasm attack is REALLY BAD if she decides to swap targets in the middle of it which she can apparently.
[1:11:48] <%SveriSageAdvice> fuck, i need this for my build
[1:11:48] <%greasypete00> thats gross
[1:11:48] <%Maids4lyfe> I hate it
[1:11:51] <%radiorosewater> pontiffs eye
[1:11:51] <kazadog> pontiffs left eye
[1:11:53] <PenguinPall> I think the theory is that Ranni is their boss
[1:11:57] <%SveriSageAdvice> i was literally coming here next
[1:11:59] <%luftraumm1> bloodborne yeah
[1:12:02] <boostergoldz> you can go full rally
[1:12:03] <%furiousfurioso> @RubberFistFight you really dont
[1:12:06] <+Rofiarf> naah there is a bloodborne item later
[1:12:06] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt Gloam Eyed Queen is 100% gonna be a DLC boss
[1:12:08] <%YakumoYomi> Probably more like the Pontiff's Left Eye from DS3
[1:12:10] <+Schrodingers_Box> I thought it was Rykard?
[1:12:11] <+ratreborn> they dicks
[1:12:11] <sundizzle> what if i said there's an actual bloodborne rally mechanic
[1:12:17] <%TheAdMerlin> Ranni isn't hte only Empyreon, there's a few of them
[1:12:19] <%luftraumm1> wait ranni is their boss???
[1:12:21] <%crimsonharvest> on the one hand i hate gods
[1:12:22] <BYAKURENLOVER763> theyre kind of a problem
[1:12:25] <+LandOfTheWay> from what i know of the lore, ranni probably isn't the gloam eyed queen. think she might be marika's sister
[1:12:25] <it_came_from_outer_space> @RubberFistFight you really can just beat her normally
[1:12:27] <+Schrodingers_Box> I want Moon DLC
[1:12:27] <TrollKing96> @PatStaresAt How do you think the balance of these Souls game would work with CRPG values?
[1:12:29] <%Cozy90> i just want a dedicated PVP arena
[1:12:30] <%barrakuta371> that thing looks awful, ability seems useful
[1:12:31] <rosabellamelantha> Ranni is NOT their boss
[1:12:36] <%SveriSageAdvice> dude if the DLC is as big as any one of these regions, i'll flip my shit lol
[1:12:39] <BigBruthaThunda> I just want them to patch the unfinished questlines
[1:12:41] <NewWillinium> The Game feels overwhelming at first, but after a while it doesn't feel as much
[1:12:45] <$OfficerMods> they put the dlcs in this game and forgot to charge you
[1:12:49] <TioXyco> Classical RPG
[1:12:50] <rosabellamelantha> there's a bunch of other godskin lore that clashes with Ranni's
[1:12:58] <%zaradax95> i honestly feel this game doesnt need dlc
[1:13:01] <%imthewisejanitor> Canadian RPGs?
[1:13:01] <@QueequegTheater> It wouldn't, at all
[1:13:01] <rosabellamelantha> so it's not her
[1:13:02] <heartlesshealer> What counts as classical?
[1:13:06] <+Schrodingers_Box> Id be Happy with DLC thats effectively just one of the Legacy Dungeons
[1:13:07] <%Monkeyweed21> Well you're in Heavensward right now so the next DLC will be Stormblood right
[1:13:07] <%crimsonharvest> you mean like if it rolled for everything like morrowind?
[1:13:10] <%Dunsparcetheglare> @PatStaresAt theres a dark souls table top coming out
[1:13:10] <TrollKing96> Baldur's gate values @PatStaresAt
[1:13:12] <Fien111> I wanna know for certain how much dev time they had on this game. Cause I'm sure it was much less than you'd think for a game this big
[1:13:13] <digaogrunge> CRPGS mean Computer RPGS, not Classic
[1:13:21] <NewWillinium> I'm still mad that Kenneth Haight's quest apparently goes NOWHERE
[1:13:22] <+swesterly> DLCs? You mean the 6 subterranean sections and the secret zone?
[1:13:23] <ebrion> Did you check the White Samuri gear?
[1:13:26] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> yeah it made a kajillion bucks
[1:13:29] <NewWillinium> His VA was so much fun
[1:13:30] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> probably
[1:13:31] <sundizzle> I hope they put DLC on a boat
[1:13:37] <%Valdorick> There's TWELVE placeholder NPCs in the game files!
[1:13:37] <fishmonger555> I want DLC that takes place pre-shattering, maybe during the night of black knives
[1:13:37] <+Schrodingers_Box> There is confirmed Muiltiple Cut Quests that just end
[1:13:38] <Saturation_Lizard> there's definitely plenty of spaces on the map where you could slap a DLC island
[1:13:39] <+BloodyBurney> hell, it could have multiple
[1:13:40] <%zaradax95> it will have dlc but its the most complete game ive seen come out in years
[1:13:40] <%Willowight> i thought that was for tabletop games turned into a video game
[1:13:40] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt Marika came from somewhere, These are the lands between. Between what?
[1:13:41] <%Valdorick> ~12~
[1:13:42] <+Queenemereldas> why didnt ssekiro get dlc?
[1:13:44] <+TheBitingIrish> I thought Sekiro would get DLC, but look where that got me
[1:13:44] <%Monkeyweed21> They literally said they were already working on DLC iirc
[1:13:44] <+Rofiarf> i think pat know what crpgs means, hes confused what you mean by the question, i think.
[1:13:46] <%crimsonharvest> d&d stats make no sense to even consider using when the power curve goes from 'you are a corpse' to 'you have absorbed the power of all gods'
[1:13:47] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> was the dlcs of the other soulsbonrne games as obtuse to find as DS1?
[1:13:47] <RubberFistFight> @Fien111 given the amount of bugs and balance issues present, yeah. i'd say they didn't spend as much time polishing as people thinjk./
[1:13:48] <Giztech> i feel like people that talk about DLC this early don't explore the map
[1:13:49] <%radiorosewater> space DLC
[1:13:49] <%luftraumm1> hmmmm it would be hard to set up a game like  this in a d20 base
[1:13:50] <+ReallyBigRocks> Time machine DLC
[1:13:50] <@QueequegTheater> Why is it silly
[1:13:51] <okramv> how do you access dld
[1:13:52] <heartlesshealer> then which computer rpgs? there's rpgs that are essentially jrpgs on the pc from old times
[1:13:53] <digaogrunge> The Dark Souls Tabletop RPG is a hack of 5e Dnd
[1:13:53] <@QueequegTheater> I want more content
[1:13:56] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> The game practically says outright what will be dlc
[1:13:57] <+Schrodingers_Box> Kenny Haight, Nephli Loux for example
[1:14:10] <NewWillinium> Wait Lands-In-Between.  . . . Are we playing in Purgatory?
[1:14:10] <boostergoldz> yeah instead of dlc in sekiro we got a bunch of free stuff what a let down
[1:14:13] <Pt_Kamen> ECLIPSE dlc
[1:14:14] <%Monkeyweed21> missed an item in the corpse pile
[1:14:16] <%Cozy90> Would you guys play a souls game that had a mmo like structure?
[1:14:17] <+Schrodingers_Box> Also that Item you get from Alexanders quest with no use.
[1:14:19] <+aaymon86> This game is so gigantic that they could release DLC 2 years later.
[1:14:26] <NewWillinium> Or like a Afterlife? Is this Valhalla?
[1:14:31] <it_came_from_outer_space> @RubberFistFight The game definitely got rushed out the door somewhat, delays are an easy indicator of this
[1:14:32] <%strakillias> Fuck DLC this game needs to have full on expansion packs. Just dump a new continent off to the side
[1:14:33] <BYAKURENLOVER763> these merchant dudes are crazy
[1:14:36] <+swesterly> @Cozy90 fuck no
[1:14:38] <BYAKURENLOVER763> how did he get here?
[1:14:38] <klooswep> If the DLC is on a boat, that means that Miyazaki can finally adapt the best part of Berserk!
[1:14:40] <+LandOfTheWay> how the fuck did this guy get up here?
[1:14:44] <klooswep> Kappa
[1:14:47] <Ethel9727> First DLC: "Welcome to the town of...Tharnam."
[1:14:48] <+TheBitingIrish> Idk, they're pretty damn tough
[1:14:52] <RubberFistFight> And honestly despite enjoying it for the most part, I do feel like the game used the "polish vader's helm with woodoo hide to mask the flaws" thing. Whenever people talk about it the first things that get mentioned are "open world", "beautiful", "so much detail", etc.
[1:14:59] <+swesterly> "this is how far the vagabond made it"
[1:15:00] <%Aeoneth> Kill them to centralize all merchants in one place
[1:15:04] <boostergoldz> and vagabond is just straight worse than the knight set
[1:15:12] <+Schrodingers_Box> DLC "TO THE MOON! YOUR WAIFU NEEDS YOU"
[1:15:14] <Pt_Kamen> @NewWillinium it's midgard, middle kingdom kind of word
[1:15:14] <RubberFistFight> Dazzling people with spectacle is a tried-and-true method.
[1:15:15] <TrollKing96> @PatStaresAt I mean values like in Baldur's Gate or Pathfinder.
[1:15:23] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> i just want the dlc to have more respec items
[1:15:28] <%radiorosewater> thats a lot of words
[1:15:36] <eleskei> PAT
[1:15:36] <%Hexidimentional> @Schrodingers_Box i hate that what you said is a spoiler
[1:15:37] <+Schrodingers_Box> That Fortress is important to access optional area
[1:15:39] <TrollKing96> @PatStaresAt Numerical.
[1:15:40] <eleskei> oh nvm
[1:15:43] <klooswep> Family values Kappa
[1:15:43] <@QueequegTheater> What does that mean
[1:15:45] <digaogrunge> What does that mean?
[1:15:45] <Ashecroft> I think I feel fairly confident in quitting Elden Ring. The game is great, but I am not and I just cant enjoy it. Oh well, it was a decent 30 hour attempt
[1:15:50] <+5Two> Killing Patches early gets you a great early game weapon.
[1:15:58] <TrollKing96> @PatStaresAt Yes
[1:16:00] <+Schrodingers_Box> Wait in thought people said he had done that?
[1:16:00] <%luftraumm1> i think that rolling this game into a d20 base would lose a LOT of the interest
[1:16:03] <DensityD> m-masaka
[1:16:05] <RubberFistFight> @Ashecroft what killed it for you?
[1:16:06] <boostergoldz> yeah but you have to kill patches
[1:16:13] <+Schrodingers_Box> So he hasnt done Moon Waifu quest?
[1:16:14] <heartlesshealer> oh. You mean high values of "8"
[1:16:19] <%TG_Cid11> like 1 to 20 D&D style?
[1:16:19] <+ReallyBigRocks> I mean, the numbers don't matter at all as long as everything is scaled the same
[1:16:24] <%crimsonharvest> oh yeah i murdered Big P immediately what a chode
[1:16:30] <%Willowight> low numbers feel better to me, feels better when they get high
[1:16:36] <BYAKURENLOVER763> but you shouldn't kill patches!
[1:16:38] <BYAKURENLOVER763> he's your boy!
[1:16:43] <Butch_DeLoria> Yeah but doing that locks you out of the Belmont whip
[1:16:45] <Ashecroft> @RubberFistFight Generally being beaten repeatedly by bosses and the sheer vastness of the open world. Both just really wore me down
[1:16:47] <+ReallyBigRocks> 4.5 could be 450 if you want it to be
[1:16:51] <NewHamwall> I hate this
[1:16:51] <+ratreborn> jelly
[1:16:52] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt use the jelly summon
[1:16:52] <%MaybeFalco> SURE IS
[1:16:54] <%crimsonharvest> friend ahead, try summoning
[1:16:55] <Augus7717> i love this one
[1:16:55] <Talinu> Doesn't that knight in the south also have a +8 spear?
[1:16:56] <heartlesshealer> yeah those low numerical values don't work with all the things that vary up the damage you do to something's health
[1:16:58] <DensityD> cotton eye joe
[1:16:58] <%NBUsagi> And instantly creepy
[1:16:59] <%SveriSageAdvice> they are not kidding you
[1:17:00] <TwistParabola> FRIEND
[1:17:00] <%YakumoYomi> Jellyfish?!
[1:17:01] <+Schrodingers_Box> This has a really weird puzzle solution
[1:17:02] <fishmonger555> ;-;
[1:17:05] <eleskei> a smol girl
[1:17:05] <heartlesshealer> Jelly?
[1:17:05] <%Valdorick> Don't TELL him the solution
[1:17:11] <fiabobia> : D
[1:17:12] <digaogrunge> A 50 in an Elden Ring Atribute is like a 20 in DnD
[1:17:13] <DestroPrime83> It sounds like Kill all NPCs to get really good gear
[1:17:14] <%Hexidimentional> who's talking
[1:17:16] <Solvari> peepoSad
[1:17:17] <%NBUsagi> Talking jelly?
[1:17:19] <Jace_Keats> BROOOOO
[1:17:19] <BYAKURENLOVER763> its ok he knows
[1:17:22] <+Schrodingers_Box> Wait...did this get spoiled for him?
[1:17:25] <klooswep> LUL
[1:17:28] <NewHamwall> HOW did you instantly know
[1:17:28] <heartlesshealer> Sad jelly
[1:17:37] <NewHamwall> I'm so mad this took me like 3 hours
[1:17:37] <+Schrodingers_Box> or did he really remember it that fast?
[1:17:37] <%dekkitout> BibleThump
[1:17:38] <+Schrodingers_Box> wow
[1:17:40] <+ReallyBigRocks> aww
[1:17:42] <outofbonelesswings> Yoooo that's sick
[1:17:42] <%luftraumm1> <3
[1:17:43] <RubberFistFight> @RubberFistFight I feel like they didn't do enough to mesh their quest design with the open world design. And yeah, fighting the same 5 bosses over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over does get really tedious really fast.
[1:17:45] <+TheBitingIrish> BibleThump
[1:17:46] <%Call_Me_Deacon_Blues> legit saf
[1:17:46] <%VHGS> chat it's not that fucking mysterious

[1:18:39] <@QueequegTheater> rd row
[1:18:40] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> So fancy
[1:18:40] <+ReallyBigRocks> yeyeye
[1:18:41] <it_came_from_outer_space> I love the gestures in this game

[1:18:53] <+TheBitingIrish> Wait, was that a fourth tier of spirit ashes?
[1:18:54] <boostergoldz> t-pose and fancy spin both assert dominance
[1:18:59] <NewWillinium> That's really good
[1:19:05] <klooswep> Pog
[1:19:10] <+TuskDeluxe> glass cannon talisman
[1:19:14] <+ReallyBigRocks> bruh
[1:19:17] <+ReallyBigRocks> why
[1:19:19] <+alphonseisbest> @patstaresat when u say DLC for this is silly do u mean overwhelming? cuz Skyrim is about as large as this game world is and that had TONS of DLC some of which was whole games in size
[1:19:22] <eleskei> yea
[1:19:23] <digaogrunge> 200hp?!
[1:19:25] <heartlesshealer> cut consumption by around 1/4 for less max health
[1:19:29] <+Shimano232> it's 50% spell cost and 10% hp reduction i believe.
[1:19:31] <%VictorVonLouche> about 10 vit?
[1:19:34] <@QueequegTheater> Hey, does anyone know why Raya Lucaria is closed for me? I already have the glintstone key
[1:19:35] <%dekkitout> What % is that?
[1:19:36] <pillowwasp> Gamer mage
[1:19:39] <+ReallyBigRocks> imma put my soul in this rock, oops i died
[1:19:44] <heartlesshealer> 50% sounds insane???
[1:19:45] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> chat: "summon the jellyfish"   - 2 seconds after the npc appears
[1:19:47] <%crimsonharvest> if a boss kills you in 2 anyway then losing 230 doesnt really matter much huh
[1:20:02] <%YakumoYomi> 12
[1:20:04] <no123450n> percentile or flat?
[1:20:05] <+ZaheerMyHomeBoy> 12
[1:20:09] <heartlesshealer> 12
[1:20:09] <%crimsonharvest> probably rounded
[1:20:12] <%crimsonharvest> 25%?
[1:20:14] <TwistParabola> 20%
[1:20:17] <+Schrodingers_Box> That description is relevant to something quest related
[1:20:18] <Talinu> This would be good for spells that cost a lot.
[1:20:18] <heartlesshealer> 12 cost
[1:20:21] <%tetraes> its better the more FP a spell takes
[1:20:22] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt it's percentile so more worth it on big spells
[1:20:28] <%Dunsparcetheglare> try with dragon breath?
[1:20:29] <heartlesshealer> 1/4 ~ 1/5
[1:20:30] <%Monkeyweed21> 10% health for 20% less cost
[1:20:40] <%watts121> IMO FP cost reducers are never worth it. Just make more blue juice.
[1:20:43] <boostergoldz> 100% not worth it when you can have infinite fp for 10 seconds without a ring slot
[1:20:43] <%Dakuu75> Wow… Pat’s numbers are mega
[1:20:58] <critfumble_> meh
[1:21:04] <%luftraumm1> bigger spells are afected more
[1:21:09] <+superchronicc> its probably worth it for cheap spells
[1:21:12] <digaogrunge> very meh
[1:21:19] <critfumble_> surprised thats not where the jelly shield is
[1:21:20] <%crimsonharvest> is there something you can channel for your whole bar no matter how big it is, that might be the best use for it
[1:21:26] <%VictorVonLouche> I guess you have all those items stack for an insane FP cost reduction
[1:21:28] <%Zundelle> I would actually take that hit if it didn't also cost me a talisman slot
[1:21:29] <%luftraumm1> get batted
[1:21:30] <heartlesshealer> It's more worth it when you full cast and spam quick spells probably
[1:21:33] <+alphonseisbest> @patstaresat when u say DLC for this is silly do u mean overwhelming? cuz Skyrim is about as large as this game world is and that had TONS of DLC some of which was whole games in size
[1:21:34] <Butch_DeLoria> Why reduce FP cost when you can just use the physick flask tear that gives infinite FP for 15 seconds
[1:21:35] <Saturation_Lizard> there's a lot of rings in the game that just dont do enough, especially the incantation/sorcery damage boost rings
[1:21:41] <LMTTN> Does any gear/talismans upgrade the horse?
[1:21:42] <%watts121> Yeah maybe Glintstone Pebble spam..but I would still just have another damage increaser honestly.
[1:21:44] <+Schrodingers_Box> Yes i think?
[1:21:44] <+ReallyBigRocks> I hate bats 😡
[1:21:45] <NewWillinium> As far as I am aware yeah
[1:21:49] <Zourath> Might be worth it if it stacks with other fp cost reduction, but on its own kind of meh.
[1:21:51] <TwistParabola> think so
[1:22:13] <+swesterly> this erdtree sure is a fun one
[1:22:19] <+Schrodingers_Box> There is one at the Fort enterance.

[1:24:36] <baronvonbirman> Ever Brilliant Goldmask indeed! bitterDab
[1:24:40] <eleskei> HE HATES IT
[1:24:40] <%Aeoneth> I hope Goldmask becomes a recurring character from here out
[1:24:43] <%Hexidimentional> wait that's goldmask? i found him before the trainer did lmao
[1:24:43] <+ReallyBigRocks> maybe you're just not finding them Kappa
[1:24:44] <+swesterly> the monk is fully shinji mode in the face of goldmask giga chadding on him
[1:24:52] <NewHamwall> It's Fort Knight
[1:24:53] <%sonuke_draws> and a giant
[1:24:53] <+superchronicc> FORT, NIGHT!
[1:24:58] <%rDAKODAc> rDAKODAc subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months, currently on a 8 month streak! Gold Mask has such a way with words
[1:24:59] <sundizzle> fort, night
[1:25:02] <TwistParabola> Fort, Noon?
[1:25:03] <+izanagi22> I mean the capital was also pretty stingy with grace sites too
[1:25:04] <DestroPrime83> That mountain is a dead dude
[1:25:07] <%SveriSageAdvice> no for real the area only has a handful, like maybe 6-7
[1:25:14] <+Schrodingers_Box> I would purposefully travel at Night to be able to see them easier
[1:25:15] <+FlappySeal_> climate?
[1:25:17] <heartlesshealer> Biome?
[1:25:24] <DestroPrime83> anyone else see the giant dead guy?
[1:25:36] <+swesterly> so has Pat done the sewers
[1:25:45] <pissdegaulle> Kappa

[1:26:25] <%NBUsagi> It seems Erdtrees are super resilient
[1:26:25] <+ReallyBigRocks> inb4 it's both
[1:26:29] <%Dakuu75> Do we have a vague idea of the kinda ending pat’s going for?
[1:26:33] <+Schrodingers_Box> Did Pat find the Mimic Tear btw?
[1:26:38] <eleskei> who is that
[1:26:41] <+swesterly> tiche is fucking cooked

[1:26:45] <sundizzle> YEYEYE
[1:26:45] <%radiorosewater> @Schrodingers_Box ye
[1:26:45] <%greasypete00> STANDO POWA
[1:26:45] <klooswep> It's not "an" avatar Kappa
[1:26:47] <no123450n> wtf it splits?
[1:26:49] <%SveriSageAdvice> yeah but this summon is amazing
[1:26:54] <Yakobro> wait he didn't do that for me lmao

[1:27:03] <%VictorVonLouche> Bye spirirt
[1:27:05] <%Willowight> 2 v 2!
[1:27:06] <%dekkitout> Did Pontiff reincarnate as a tree?
[1:27:07] <%crimsonharvest> very on-brand for something called an avatar to have linked health pool
[1:27:08] <+imthinkingdarbys> see ya tiche
[1:27:12] <oda_flobunaga> Erd Tree Avatussy
[1:27:12] <klooswep> Darklurker!
[1:27:14] <heartlesshealer> Oh, lonely fight
[1:27:18] <Fien111> "Oh fuck, now there's two of them"
[1:27:18] <%Daskolin> @swesterly Tiche is the best waifu and no one can change my mind
[1:27:21] <+BloodyBurney> man i nuked this guy before he did this, no idea lol
[1:27:22] <@QueequegTheater> The old Darklurker trick
[1:27:23] <%Hexidimentional> haha killed himself
[1:27:27] <TwistParabola> gg
[1:27:29] <%Dakuu75> Still only one health bar
[1:27:29] <no123450n> tree felled
[1:27:29] <%NBUsagi> Pat is the ultimate dragon
[1:27:32] <+Schrodingers_Box> To be honest always found Mimic Tear to be the best at full power
[1:27:32] <sundizzle> technically pontiff was always a tree @dekkitout
[1:27:36] <boostergoldz> black knife summon got melted holy shit
[1:27:36] <+swesterly> Mimic-kun is best summon imo
[1:27:37] <heartlesshealer> good job
[1:27:43] <Yakobro> can make it 100% heal
[1:27:44] <+Rofiarf> bubble below
[1:27:47] <+ReallyBigRocks> two halves of the same whole
[1:27:48] <Clyderso> 100% FP in 1 sip, completely useless
[1:27:53] <Saturation_Lizard> you can make your physik a fully restore now
[1:27:55] <heartlesshealer> wonder if it takes double rot damage when you get both of the bodies on it
[1:28:06] <lyzejag> lol
[1:28:09] <+TuskDeluxe> Kappa
[1:28:11] <%Hexidimentional> you can make that jump pat cmon
[1:28:12] <%luftraumm1> stingy graces
[1:28:19] <+Schrodingers_Box> Get Ready for Attack on Titan.
[1:28:25] <PenguinPall> Hey chat, have Pat been the the bottom of the sewers?
[1:28:26] <lyzejag> TRUST US PAT
[1:28:26] <boostergoldz> i think it does the health bar is shared
[1:28:27] <Saturation_Lizard> @Clyderso its good if you'd rather effectively have an extra red/blue flask than a buff
[1:28:31] <NewHamwall> Coward
[1:28:32] <NewWillinium> How Graceful
[1:28:33] <%Dakuu75> @heartlesshealer I wanna say yes but, idk really
[1:28:34] <+alphonseisbest> @patstaresat when u say DLC for this is silly do u mean overwhelming? cuz Skyrim is about as large as this game world is and that had TONS of DLC some of which was whole games in size
[1:28:35] <it_came_from_outer_space> time for fort, night
[1:28:45] <%Hexidimentional> the sewers are the fucking worst
[1:28:48] <no123450n> the shittin' pit
[1:28:48] <+ReallyBigRocks> ultra bottom
[1:28:51] <+Schrodingers_Box> Did he see The Door at the bottom?
[1:28:52] <+ReallyBigRocks> the underest

[1:28:54] <TwistParabola> Fort, Evening!
[1:28:55] <%Hexidimentional> and i've been to the lake of rot
[1:28:57] <+swesterly> the sewers berserk reference is so cool
[1:28:58] <%Hexidimentional> i hate the sewers more
[1:29:03] <+alphonseisbest> skull snail wtf
[1:29:03] <cherubs_anonymous> @alphonseisbest Yeah but this game is good and actually has content
[1:29:05] <LMTTN> @Hexidimentional In this game or among Soulsborne sewers?
[1:29:09] <klooswep> 💀 🐍
[1:29:11] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt there's an easy to miss mariner in this graveyard
[1:29:14] <%Aeoneth> @Schrodingers_Box Yes but he chose not to enter The Door
[1:29:18] <ebrion> Snaileton Warriors
[1:29:19] <%Daskolin> @alphonseisbest And dont forget mods done by people in a size of the game
[1:29:24] <+FlappySeal_> oh this place lel

[1:29:25] <it_came_from_outer_space> @alphonseisbest bro 3 times is enough

[1:29:28] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> hey yall, even if he did, probably dont ask "Hey did pat see ___ yet"
[1:29:29] <PenguinPall> OKay, but did he see the "THING" at the bottom?
[1:29:30] <%crimsonharvest> try down
[1:29:31] <Jace_Keats> monkaW
[1:29:35] <NewWillinium> @alphonseisbest I Love Skyrim but I woould argue that this game's game world is at least 5 times as big. Which makes sense considering that it was made more then a decade later

[1:32:11] <DestroPrime83> You cock is so huge pat
[1:32:11] <doster504> @psimon_ poise is a stat that armor gives you where the heavier the armor the larger poise is
[1:32:31] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> solaire Y posed
[1:32:32] <%Hexidimentional> @it_came_from_outer_space i think goldmask is supposed to be solaire
[1:32:38] <doster504> @psimon_ it's supposed to make it so you don't flinch when getting hit but it doesn't really do anything in this game
[1:32:44] <TioXyco> NO ELP NOPPERS
[1:32:45] <%Aeoneth> @it_came_from_outer_space Notice they both use a Sun motif

[1:38:02] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt that should have been the last one? I guess you're missing one somewhere
[1:38:04] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Did you know that sometimes you can see Gurranq outside howling in the direction of the final zone
[1:38:08] <%Deft_Thought> Big ole beastman eating death plants
[1:38:14] <rosabellamelantha> since if you had them all he'd vanish
[1:38:15] <%angryoptimist> I presume this dude's deal is he's hangry.
[1:38:16] <+ReallyBigRocks> @Deft_Thought he eat the death
[1:38:20] <no123450n> there are like 9 deathweeds I think
[1:38:20] <%CTMathiu> Puppy dog

[1:38:25] <Augus7717> "wouldnt you like to know?" -Miyazaki @rosabellamelantha
[1:38:26] <%cade_calrayn> @rosabellamelantha there’s one last one under the secret path to the haligtree
[1:38:32] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> you can lock invaders inside and just fuck them up
[1:38:34] <%luftraumm1> area denial must be useful

[1:39:08] <%Deft_Thought> @Deft_Thought Damn makes you think

[1:39:16] <%NBUsagi> Beast Knight!
[1:39:16] <+ReallyBigRocks> you're using the beast seal right?
[1:39:17] <pi_in_the_sci> Blackflame does that DoT
[1:39:18] <IvanMistwalker> yeah The C L A W rules
[1:39:20] <Sol_Install> both
[1:39:21] <heartlesshealer> Fire lasts longer, but claw comes out faster
[1:39:21] <%Fenrisulfr_V> Oh god I missed so much of the stream

[1:39:24] <%NBUsagi> SUPER BEAST PAT

[1:40:08] <boostergoldz> do you have the flame of frenzy
[1:40:13] <%tetraes> @PatStaresAt  u should stick with beast incants for the most part cause thats what your seal boosts
[1:40:15] <ape_hawk> barkon deez nuts
[1:40:20] <it_came_from_outer_space> killed a death rite bird and a tibia mariner @cade_calrayn

[1:40:48] <+FlappySeal_> Hello, I am seal
[1:40:57] <%CrackerJack450> CrackerJack450 subscribed with Prime. 
[1:41:04] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> beastmode combo
[1:41:04] <%cade_calrayn> Ahh the bird
[1:41:23] <it_came_from_outer_space> probably fuck all
[1:41:24] <%cade_calrayn> If that was the 7th Deathroot there’s two more
[1:41:27] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> pocket sand
[1:41:31] <%Cozy90> yusuke urameshi shotgun
[1:41:41] <+TheBitingIrish> About half as much as the boulder
[1:41:44] <+LandOfTheWay> i heard beat sling is really useful in pvp cause it's basically a quickfire shotgun
[1:41:56] <signofzeta> oh i remember playing a demo of that AGES ago!
[1:41:57] <+LandOfTheWay> *beast
[1:42:00] <@QueequegTheater> WHEN CHROMEHOUNDS 2 THO
[1:42:06] <%RigmaroleHM> I need to play LBA2
[1:42:06] <%SveriSageAdvice> i literally never knew the name of it and it was one of those games lost to me until you brought it up on the podcast @PatStaresAt
[1:42:12] <%Hexidimentional> how do i get down without dying, is the elden ring question
[1:42:12] <boostergoldz> anything that's fast is useful in pvp
[1:42:30] <+imthinkingdarbys> oh i had a shareware disk for twinsen's odyssey
[1:42:46] <+FlappySeal_> did she get locked in like the Tomb Raider butler?
[1:42:48] <%dekkitout> He knew food was implied
[1:42:53] <eleskei> this is mean but it would be funny if you could kick goldmask off a ledge just to see that priest guy freak out
[1:42:59] <%RealThiele> did pat do the zone behind mohg last night i missed it
[1:42:59] <%luftraumm1> bong
[1:43:03] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @PatStaresAt I've been doing a run with just the Misericorde and a Buckler, and there's so much more you can parry in this game than I thought.
[1:43:04] <BYAKURENLOVER763> bing bong
[1:43:07] <sundizzle> dog
[1:43:23] <RubberFistFight> @RealThiele no. Chat convinced him it would break his game.
[1:43:32] <boostergoldz> like the majority of margitt's moveset
[1:43:34] <%RealThiele> boooo
[1:43:36] <ape_hawk> so whats the point of the turtles other than remembrances?
[1:43:38] <%Schrodingers_Box> You can parry Moon Blade
[1:43:38] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> a parry-only run would be insane
[1:43:38] <%radiorosewater> You can parry birds
[1:43:45] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @PatStaresAt The Godskin Apostle can be parried, but you have to parry him twice in a row to knock him down, as an example.
[1:43:54] <+TheBitingIrish> Can you parry Nightriders right off their horses?
[1:43:56] <no123450n> parry Radahn meteor dive
[1:43:56] <BYAKURENLOVER763> YOU CAN PARRY BIRDS!?
[1:44:03] <PersonifiedTFT> I parried the final boss yesterday
[1:44:04] <oda_flobunaga> @RealThiele he did the fall puzzle
[1:44:07] <%cade_calrayn> @rubberfistfight pretty sure I saw him go all the way down to the bottom?
[1:44:08] <TioXyco> sword birds
[1:44:11] <%Freakin_Wolfy> with good timing
[1:44:13] <%dekkitout> Crows moght
[1:44:16] <%dekkitout> *might
[1:44:17] <+TheBitingIrish> Does it need to?
[1:44:19] <%radiorosewater> ye, the sword birds
[1:44:20] <%zaradax95> you parry birds cuz they have swords
[1:44:21] <%radiorosewater> no
[1:44:28] <%RealThiele> bummer that zone pat missed is cool
[1:44:28] <%TINMANxHMx> dumb birbs the bane of my playthrough
[1:44:29] <Ghufufin> french birbs do
[1:44:30] <%radiorosewater> bird is smart :(
[1:44:33] <RubberFistFight> @cade_calrayn yes but he didn't go through the door because a bunch of people told him the game would end right there if he did.
[1:44:36] <Sunstalker> Pat, fi you can riposte a child, you can riposte a bird.
[1:44:40] <%cade_calrayn> Birds have sword in this game
[1:44:42] <jubejube56> A bird understands falling on its face
[1:44:43] <+ScrapKingKeita> Of course you can, there is this dude who has Rheas that he takes care of and he has to riposte them with a garbage can lid
[1:44:45] <%delilah4you> Stupid birds cant be parried because they dont know what a parry is
[1:44:47] <+deathbyace> what about irl birds?
[1:44:51] <%captain_thickthighs> of course birds know about repost who you think started Twitter
[1:44:52] <MikeCosimano> You can parry your cousin in certain parts of the world Kappa
[1:44:55] <+FlappySeal_> god is angry
[1:44:58] <%delilah4you> Oh I cant wait for this nonsense
[1:45:00] <%MaybeFalco> its a pretty good castle
[1:45:00] <digaogrunge> Drop the bing bong
[1:45:01] <Oxybe> Lightning feilds? is this FFX?
[1:45:02] <bobxmaker> i was originally gonna go dex/int and parry my way through the game but there's so many enemies that i just use the carian greatsword >.<
[1:45:02] <BYAKURENLOVER763> praise the sun!
[1:45:03] <ape_hawk> castle fartbutt
[1:45:03] <TwistParabola> Fort, Night!
[1:45:04] <samuelfisk> Does something have to understand a riposte to be riposted
[1:45:05] <%zaradax95> people really just lied to a streamer like that?
[1:45:07] <+BloodyBurney> what, no way
[1:45:07] <%Hexidimentional> castle superbeast
[1:45:10] <+CatRidder> castle bloodborne
[1:45:14] <sundizzle> fort, night

[1:45:36] <ape_hawk> the snow texture is masking it
[1:45:38] <%abakkus> they blend in well
[1:45:39] <NewHamwall> It's hard to see because white on why
[1:45:42] <Augus7717> you hit the feet pat
[1:45:43] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> core to a parry working is the enemy understanding that they just got bodied
[1:45:43] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> psaBlind
[1:45:46] <TwistParabola> blends in
[1:45:52] <sundizzle> hit that bell dog's foot

[1:45:53] <+BloodyBurney> actually hard to see because snow
[1:46:04] <+FattimusSlime> Is that a testibell?
[1:46:07] <+izanagi22> Can someone whisper me what% of the game Pat is through?
[1:46:12] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @bobxmaker Boss Soul Duplication. One per tower.
[1:46:13] <+FlappySeal_> Step on me pls uwu
[1:46:16] <sundizzle> @bobxmaker you can dupe boss souls
[1:46:17] <%BinaryFireball> you missed a spot
[1:46:18] <%BinaryFireball> lol
[1:46:20] <TwistParabola> barnacles
[1:46:27] <%captain_thickthighs> if a bell rings and no one's around to hear it does it still make a sound?
[1:46:28] <boostergoldz> why does cleaning its foot fungus kill it
[1:46:28] <+CatRidder> he hungry
[1:46:30] <%luftraumm1> cleaning giant tortle hoofies
[1:46:41] <Eye_of_the_red_giant> its because Paige is inside the fridge

[1:47:09] <+FlappySeal_> Where does the bell even go when it collapses
[1:47:16] <%BinaryFireball> omg
[1:47:20] <tanarath> Zangief is just folds of skin & bones at this point
[1:47:25] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> the bell gets sucked back up inside
[1:47:30] <@QueequegTheater> @BinaryFireball I'll fucken do it again
[1:47:30] <TwistParabola> time for Fort

[1:47:33] <%luftraumm1> where does your bell go when you colapse
[1:47:34] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Naeruto
[1:47:37] <%zaradax95> oh fuck this place
[1:47:38] <%RealThiele> Godskin Gief
[1:47:39] <BYAKURENLOVER763> heh
[1:47:43] <@Ranryu692> was that a second naruto in the corner?
[1:47:43] <heartlesshealer> so there's multiple duplication shrines or what?
[1:47:48] <%Willowight> oh sol as in sun
[1:47:49] <%Fenrisulfr_V> I wasn't a big fan of this place.
[1:47:51] <+FlappySeal_> yep, definitely blind lmao
[1:47:53] <bobxmaker> @sundizzle ok, i haven't found much of anything i use from them yet :P
[1:47:58] <%Monkeyweed21> thats Chipp zanuff
[1:47:59] <Ghufufin> hes from the ice village
[1:48:01] <%captain_thickthighs> @boostergoldz because it had athletes foot, once you get rid of it it doesn't want to do cross country
[1:48:02] <%Hexidimentional> @heartlesshealer about a few
[1:48:03] <%RealThiele> this place is :E
[1:48:10] <%BinaryFireball> @QueequegTheater i cant even
[1:48:17] <%Deft_Thought> Beast sling does nada
[1:48:21] <heartlesshealer> @heartlesshealer Cool
[1:48:24] <ape_hawk> yeah, like Gwyn
[1:48:30] <%radiorosewater> what
[1:48:30] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> blind
[1:48:31] <%dekkitout> So on input then
[1:48:31] <NewWillinium> Wait do they?
[1:48:33] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> Never charge spells against fast enemies
[1:48:35] <+FlappySeal_> Yep, it makes glintblade soooo good
[1:48:40] <+TheBitingIrish> Yea, so casters can adjust, but archers get fucked
[1:48:40] <TwistParabola> do they?
[1:48:41] <%crimsonharvest> do you suppose demihumans in general are omenkids?
[1:48:41] <%luftraumm1> beast sling is simply worse than rock throw
[1:48:44] <%zaradax95> i pulled my hair out in this area
[1:48:46] <+Arrotal> yer them dodging on cast makes rock sling the best spell in the game
[1:48:54] <heartlesshealer> you can see remnants of omen horns in the mane, yeah
[1:48:59] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> there's some spells that intentionally avoid proc-ing the dodge too
[1:49:02] <heartlesshealer> that or he just bumpy
[1:49:06] <%Monkeyweed21> @TheBitingIrish thats why archers get the delayed arrow rain ashes
[1:49:12] <Ghufufin> red glaive
[1:49:30] <%Fenrisulfr_V> I've been watching Plague's Elden Ring LP, and the 5-6 second hard freezes he's getting while roaming around on his horse are fucking ridiculous.
[1:49:31] <@Ranryu692> I wish the black flame weapon enchant lasted for longer than 15 seconds or however short it is
[1:49:32] <%crimsonharvest> seen a lot of enemies that will dodge a charged spell but not a standard cast
[1:49:45] <NewWillinium> It is a problem. Having to search for the spell you need in hectic ombat
[1:49:50] <%Bluwizard21> Wait till you try sorceries, by the end i had 5 out of the like 50
[1:49:51] <leole11> hey hey people, has pat been to the secret snow area?
[1:49:59] <%crimsonharvest> love the no-sell greatshield lifestyle
[1:50:06] <Sunstalker> Yeah, you gotta put some spells in the other quick select just to swap easier. Wish we had better quick change buttons
[1:50:06] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> hey chat, dont ask questions like that
[1:50:14] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @leole11 Not yet. Might happen today.
[1:50:19] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt More like NaraTWO
[1:50:19] <Namillus> ROUND TWO
[1:50:23] <boostergoldz> he's just starting castle sol so no
[1:50:26] <BYAKURENLOVER763> ANOTHER ONE
[1:50:26] <@Ranryu692> yep, that was another one in the corner
[1:50:31] <TwistParabola> LUL
[1:50:32] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt did you ever unlock the magma breath incant after doing Mt Gelmir?
[1:50:34] <+ReallyBigRocks> Has pat discovered the super secret path to the Scrimblo Fields?
[1:50:35] <IvanMistwalker> duplicate bug?
[1:50:36] <leole11> @leole11 @Fenrisulfr_V thanks!
[1:50:39] <@Ranryu692> it was lying down in the corner on the right when you first looked around
[1:50:39] <TwistParabola> WHAT IF THERE WERE TWO
[1:50:42] <%RealThiele> BORUTO
[1:50:46] <sundizzle> @leole11 this fort is literally how you access it, so not yet
[1:50:47] <%NBUsagi> thats a big cat 0w 0
[1:50:55] <boostergoldz> this one at least has half hp
[1:50:57] <%crimsonharvest> PS the activation of Barricade counts as a block
[1:51:00] <leole11> @sundizzle i'm silly, you're right, i forgot hehe
[1:51:07] <%Fenrisulfr_V> Where's the castle with 6 Naruto lions that all aggro when you get the first one to 1/2 HP?
[1:51:08] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> there should be a way to block anyone who starts a comment with "has pat seen ___"
[1:51:12] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt Its the. ICE OF THE TIGER!
[1:51:21] <%MaybeFalco> he was sitting in the corner to the right of the door
[1:51:22] <TwistParabola> a corner
[1:51:23] <heartlesshealer> it was next to that item
[1:51:23] <@Ranryu692> it was lying down in the corner on the right when you first looked around
[1:51:23] <signofzeta> it was sleeping ro the right of the gate
[1:51:24] <leole11> it was just there lmao
[1:51:30] <oda_flobunaga> Has Pat seen Ligma?
[1:51:39] <%Deft_Thought> psaDogchamp Faaaaaaather
[1:51:56] <@QueequegTheater> Imagine only using one greatsword Kappa
[1:52:04] <@QueequegTheater> Couldn't be me
[1:52:24] <RubberFistFight> @I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I I mean it's entirely possible for people to start a sentence like that and then successfully avoid spoilers. People just don't know how to be cryptic.
[1:52:39] <%MaybeFalco> @oda_flobunaga no but he's be to Mt. Sugondese
[1:52:45] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> every single elden ring stream is full of people who have no inhibition over spoilers and constantly ask if "streamer has seen spoiler yet"
[1:53:17] <RubberFistFight> @I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I "full" lol, it's a handful of people at worst.
[1:53:19] <Eye_of_the_red_giant> yeee guilty
[1:53:19] <@QueequegTheater> @I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I I had to stop watching Woolie's stream because of it
[1:53:51] <%BlueLunecy> I know a streamer who has the "yet" protocol on their moobot. When it's active, anything that has yet in it gets timed out
[1:53:58] <%Fenrisulfr_V> Whenever I watch Woolie's stream, I just hide the chat and pretend I'm watching a really long episode of the LP.
[1:53:59] <%delilah4you> Oh a BRB, I will just skip this
[1:54:04] <%delilah4you> Wait...THIS IS LIVE?! OH NOOOOOOOO
[1:54:08] <leole11> i just beat the game, what a masterpiece, i can't wait for pat to get to some bosses
[1:54:31] <oda_flobunaga> Yeah, I like going in with obviously fake spoilers.  Has Pat seen the bit were the Stargate open up and an Army of Ultralisks trashes the Rivendell valley zone?
[1:54:32] <%delilah4you> I cant wait for pat to go to LOCATION and see CONTENT
[1:54:36] <%delilah4you> Maybe fight BOSS and find ITEM
[1:54:45] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I There were some big shitheads in Max's stream that were backseating so hard that, I think, Max had to go into emote only mode temporarily.
[1:54:50] <%zaradax95> i mean, he'll get to allt he bosses eventually right? i dont think any big ones are missable
[1:54:51] <zanzibarian_hamster> I cant wait for pat to get to the part that is just literally the entirety of dark souls again
[1:55:02] <%MaybeFalco> cant wait for pat to see scrimbli bimblo
[1:55:14] <leole11> scimbli bimblo had the best boss fight
[1:55:17] <Eye_of_the_red_giant> i asked Pat if he "found Frozen Lightning Spear and where is it" minutes before he found it
[1:55:21] <+dearghostss> where is pat right now? just started watching
[1:55:34] <%zaradax95> fort sol
[1:55:43] <@QueequegTheater> @dearghostss Last 1/4 of the game
[1:55:43] <DuckAlfred> dog walkin
[1:55:44] <+ReallyBigRocks> Can you imagine if you walked through a door and the game just popped "Blighttown" up on the screen
[1:55:48] <$drabberfaun535> I also cant wait for pat to get to the scrimbli bimblo
[1:56:00] <leole11> @ReallyBigRocks nah, "Anor Londo, Again really"
[1:56:13] <%Fenrisulfr_V> I'm still kinda pissed over the guy that spoiled the Goldmask riddle to Pat.
[1:56:32] <%Fenrisulfr_V> If for no other reason than me getting to see Pat's eyes bug out when he reads it.
[1:56:43] <oda_flobunaga> I'm really surprised that Pat has managed to Miss the Cohen the Barbarian quest line

[1:57:42] <@Ranryu692> where you picked up that item is where the second Naruto was hiding

[1:58:07] <$Jaxnos> the second naruto lion was the bottom.
[1:58:08] <@Ranryu692> I dunno, I've run into a few big enemies at half health, it's weird
[1:58:09] <+Kyma1020> Naruto has been in the zeitgeist so long that it's interchangeable to ninja at this point
[1:58:10] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> He probably got hit by the first naruto
[1:58:10] <no123450n> nute
[1:58:12] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> naruto killed them all first
[1:58:13] <+ReallyBigRocks> Naruto killed everyone
[1:58:14] <%sniffy77> sniffy77 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 19 months! Hey Pat I just got to the Lake of Rot. Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
[1:58:16] <mike2hands> stoopid phone didn't notify me about the stream
[1:58:17] <Ghufufin> that was sasuke duh
[1:58:20] <oda_flobunaga> because *spoiler*
[1:58:22] <heartlesshealer> they probably ate everyone
[1:58:23] <andoowhy> because you're in a forbidden zone?
[1:58:24] <digaogrunge> The narutos killed everyone?
[1:58:30] <andoowhy> idk
[1:58:31] <DuckAlfred> maybe the lions killed everyone
[1:58:35] <%Fenrisulfr_V> I'm really happy Fromsoft finally got to make their "Snow Giants" area. Been waiting for it since DeS.
[1:58:36] <+aaymon86> The sad thing is, not a single Naruto fan would disagree with you
[1:58:37] <%cade_calrayn> Pat, who the fuck would live here?
[1:58:40] <+LandOfTheWay> the appropriate reaction
[1:58:48] <heartlesshealer> I'm only guessing, I know jack shit about this fort
[1:58:51] <@QueequegTheater> I want to go home, O I want to go home...

[1:59:11] <Sunstalker> The mushroom armor helps A LOT with the ROT
[1:59:19] <%MaybeFalco> it definitely works better with faster weapons

[2:01:41] <DuckAlfred> up the ladder
[2:01:43] <%geekjacob> ia it important
[2:01:44] <@Ranryu692> are the rewards for finding the locations in the paintings any good?
[2:01:48] <heartlesshealer> upstairs
[2:01:48] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @PatStaresAt I ended up looking at a guide for all the paintings after I picked up all of them.
[2:01:49] <leole11> up the ladder
[2:01:54] <MaraSmug> @oda_flobunaga I did, it was awful. This game feels like everything does more damage than previous games
[2:01:58] <+Rofiarf> the body
[2:01:59] <%dekkitout> Chat's vaunted six pairs of eyes
[2:01:59] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @Ranryu692 Some of them are great, yeah.
[2:02:03] <DensityD> mystery is dead
[2:02:07] <+ReallyBigRocks> pat you missed an item 3 areas ahead of where you are
[2:02:07] <digaogrunge> HE BLIND
[2:02:08] <Saturation_Lizard> @Ranryu692 the ones i've found are, there's one in caelid that gives a really good ash of war for bows
[2:02:08] <Eye_of_the_red_giant> VERY GOOD
[2:02:09] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Get Better Eyes
[2:02:15] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> this game is big, he doesnt need EVERY item
[2:02:18] <heartlesshealer> eye doctor
[2:02:23] <%MaybeFalco> especially that one item in the hero's grave that was super important LUL
[2:02:25] <+imthinkingdarbys> no that wasn't it
[2:02:25] <DuckAlfred> NOPE
[2:02:26] <+Rofiarf> i didn't see that one
[2:02:30] <DuckAlfred> THAT NOT IT
[2:02:30] <leole11> ooooo nice
[2:02:30] <heartlesshealer> I DIDN'T KNOW THAT ONE
[2:02:32] <$Jaxnos> the funny part is that wasn't the item people meant
[2:02:32] <NewHamwall> Looks like you.... killed a bird with a stone
[2:02:34] <ArgentUndaCova> Dafuq Pat just throwing rocks LUL
[2:02:35] <oda_flobunaga> @MaraSmug yeah, I only have 25 vigor and I'm at the final boss
[2:02:35] <%JokerNewby> you can mash the rock throw
[2:02:36] <@Spydurman> we didn't even see that LUL
[2:02:38] <tanarath> no
[2:02:43] <%Schrodingers_Box> It was on a body under the tent up there
[2:02:45] <tanarath> It's by the ladder
[2:02:49] <heartlesshealer> Different item, but cool find
[2:02:49] <%Eldalu> bird was like, noty
[2:02:52] <Eye_of_the_red_giant> killing one bird with one stone and sword
[2:02:55] <%RealThiele> bird is stronk
[2:02:56] <AthenaAegis> I guess you'd call that bird....a ROC Kappa
[2:02:58] <%dekkitout> A bird that isn't flying type? Weird
[2:02:59] <%Fenrisulfr_V> I hate the fire birds
[2:03:06] <MaraSmug> @oda_flobunaga A certain optional rot boss made me completely change my build and give up on low vigor but I was about the same as you before that
[2:03:08] <$drabberfaun535> eveything here seems like newgame plus plus
[2:03:13] <+PARARScs> on corpse
[2:03:14] <%Monkeyweed21> you still missed the item
[2:03:16] <@Ranryu692> no, under the tarp there's a body with an item

[2:03:40] <%Fenrisulfr_V> You just looked at it lmao
[2:03:42] <+Rofiarf> so it makes sense
[2:03:42] <@Ranryu692> it was on screen SO many times lol
[2:03:43] <tanarath> 45 degrees to the left after you climb up
[2:03:44] <+BlandSpice> Snow blindness is real in these areas

[2:03:50] <Giztech> what does the axe do?
[2:03:52] <%Monkeyweed21> blinded by the white
[2:03:53] <$Jaxnos> did you know that 1 in 12 men suffer from color blindness?
[2:03:53] <%Fenrisulfr_V> I don't blame you on that one, I could barely see it too.

[2:04:27] <$Jaxnos> though to be fair, it was more visible when there were still brown boxes behind it
[2:04:33] <oda_flobunaga> @MaraSmug I didn't change to beat that one, I have a bleed build and ended up needing to get a barricade greatshield.  It still took me 2 days
[2:04:33] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @Giztech It's just a generic axe that starts with the Thunderstorm Weapon Art.
[2:04:35] <Nordguy> That wasn't it either, Pat. Go up

[2:05:54] <%MartinOfLoxley> GD autocorrect
[2:05:56] <RubberFistFight> lol just confirmed yet another bug in the game - fighting Alecto in the Ringleader's Evergaol. If the fire debuff kills you, when you respawn you'll be missing about 3/4 of an inch of your healthbar.
[2:06:09] <@Spydurman> @Nordguy LMAO
[2:06:25] <DramaticTension> whoa his bars are huge
[2:06:28] <DramaticTension> what level is he
[2:06:32] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @RubberFistFight That happens if you die to any hit from a black blade ability.
[2:06:33] <@QueequegTheater> 162
[2:06:36] <%EldritchBee> EldritchBee subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 10 months! Castle Sol, eh? Fuck this place
[2:06:40] <%RealThiele> BNG
[2:06:40] <@Ranryu692> is 100k runes even enough for a level for Pat anymore?
[2:06:45] <$Jaxnos> damn
[2:06:47] <+ReallyBigRocks> oh jesus he leveled up even more
[2:06:48] <%NBUsagi> Ice Knight 0w 0

[2:06:52] <DramaticTension> 162 on NG? Holy moly
[2:06:53] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @Ranryu692 Hasn't been for a while.
[2:06:53] <doster504> @RubberFistFight speaking of bugs when you die after riding Torrent does Torrent's health still stay where it was for you
[2:06:54] <@QueequegTheater> Hey I think Woolie's fighting this guy too Kappa
[2:06:55] <heartlesshealer> almost
[2:07:00] <%Pookiedaexzile> NightCrawlered

[2:07:08] <leole11> i finished the game at lv 177
[2:07:09] <%strakillias> Pat got Iced
[2:07:11] <RubberFistFight> @Fenrisulfr_V nope. I tested it. The only thing that does it is the big fire flurry, and only if you die specifically to the debuff it inflicts and not the attack itself.
[2:07:12] <@QueequegTheater> NO
[2:07:14] <@QueequegTheater> NO CONTENT
[2:07:16] <oda_flobunaga> @MaraSmug there are several incantations that give bleed buildup at range.  I used one of those + Tiche and the Bloody Helice rapier

[2:08:00] <Talinu> So which lord's castle is this?
[2:08:04] <+SilverDevilfish> ROCK THROW

[2:08:09] <+SilverDevilfish> super effective
[2:08:21] <@QueequegTheater> It's Fire/Bird, rock is 4x
[2:08:26] <%RealThiele> Rock-type defeats flying

[2:24:54] <NewWillinium> That Leg Drop is a One Hit Kill on most players by the way
[2:24:54] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt I killed him before he could even move after the first fight by walking in and insta casting kamehameha
[2:24:54] <signofzeta> nicely done!

[2:26:11] <+Cuon_Alpinus> Solo ONial is really good
[2:26:12] <%Pookiedaexzile> I want Mimic Chans Option
[2:26:14] <+Cuon_Alpinus> with adds is bad
[2:26:16] <oda_flobunaga> Says the Chad who oneshotted it
[2:26:17] <%dekkitout> It was a kinda wack encounter
[2:26:18] <%Cozy90> jesus 163
[2:26:18] <+Shikari21> really? i thought it was fine
[2:26:21] <+swesterly> imagine trying to do it without being able to turtle and guard counter
[2:26:23] <%RealThiele> yea mimic crushed that
[2:26:23] <+Rofiarf> oh yeah i use his armour
[2:26:26] <%luftraumm1> His big white leg, like woolie's @patstaresat
[2:26:27] <tanarath> it's fiiiiiine
[2:26:29] <+Nomenanza> his armour is pretty good for the weight it gives imo. Though god it makes you look chunky
[2:26:31] <Elykial> can i ask why it was bad/
[2:26:35] <doster504> @DramaticTension that doesn't make it a good fight it literally just throws 2 ass knights at you
[2:26:37] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @PatStaresAt You aren't done at that fort, btw.
[2:26:38] <%Pookiedaexzile> Mimic chans Opinion seems more valid on this one
[2:26:41] <DuckAlfred> there was still stuff after the boss room
[2:26:43] <Sol_Install> uh
[2:26:43] <%Zundelle> I liked the fight because it was the most obvious "okay I'm going to just use my mimic and not feel bad" fight
[2:26:45] <+Shimano232> Damn Pat, your a higher level right now then I was when I beat the game.
[2:26:46] <Sol_Install> you can tho
[2:26:48] <%Cozy90> i believe in you pat. i think you could have done it
[2:26:53] <%Bluwizard21> i beat it 176 going int tank str
[2:26:54] <cavefishes> i was at like 161 at the final boss
[2:26:55] <sundizzle> nah I beat all the content at like 155
[2:26:56] <KyberNasse> Multi fights are annoying
[2:26:57] <+Mrbaconator> this armor prob has the best defenses in the entire game
[2:27:01] <DensityD> that is very stylish
[2:27:01] <+BloodyBurney> he isnt overleveled now tbh
[2:27:04] <connerhozer> Only been watching the youtubes, nice to see some big results from scrapping
[2:27:04] <+Shikari21> wait damn i beat it at 150
[2:27:06] <+ScrapKingKeita> @Elykial Add boss that summons some of the most overtuned mob enemies in the game and all his attacks do frostbite
[2:27:06] <%RealThiele> become swole
[2:27:08] <+Mrbaconator> i beat this game at exactly level 150

[2:27:34] <%jamsbybetty> I beat it at 140 and it wasn't easy lol
[2:27:35] <signofzeta> i wish the visor wasn't up, but other than that it's a great helmet
[2:27:36] <Trace_Bovier> did it solo, it's doable you have to rush the oleg and then after him the shield guy. then just focus on veteren
[2:27:37] <tanarath> And it shows your face too!
[2:27:38] <oda_flobunaga> I love the asymmetry of so many of the sets in this
[2:27:46] <senfood> Look at the fit goddamn bruh fr fr no cap on god
[2:27:47] <%geekjacob> every day you are looking more like gale the slave knight
[2:27:48] <+OneTrueAsshat> You’re at endgame and not even at vig softcap
[2:27:48] <sundizzle> it has really good poise too
[2:27:49] <%JoshManVGH> Why is Dungeaters armor so disgusting!

[2:28:42] <%Pookiedaexzile> Go full ric flair
[2:28:45] <+imthinkingdarbys> that red hood just makes me think of Darksiders
[2:28:47] <jubejube56> How's the conversing with the Greater Will going fingers?
[2:28:48] <%EldritchBee> Looks like red riding hood from a mid 2010s action movie
[2:28:49] <%dekkitout> Better
[2:28:54] <IminyourBase> BIG HAT
[2:28:59] <doster504> @KyberNasse saw some people saying that fight was really fun on twitter I don't know what people want
[2:29:01] <oda_flobunaga> @Fenrisulfr_V i unironically rocked Margit's omen Cloak for like 50 hours
[2:29:02] <+swesterly> gank fights and endless combos is peak boss design where my ds2 bros at
[2:29:13] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> That helmet is ugly
[2:29:13] <IminyourBase> what if big hat, but metal?
[2:29:16] <digaogrunge> I love that metal sombrero
[2:29:18] <+alphonseisbest> oh wow yea u CAN just make WAR from darksiders huh
[2:29:29] <%Willowight> wish they didnt have the sword on shoulder idle that clips through everything
[2:29:32] <%sniffy77> Hey Pat here's a update on Lake of Rot: It sucks balls
[2:29:51] <%Pookiedaexzile> Wonder what happened to the DS2 team, like are they alive
[2:29:57] <%NopeBadguy> i can't wait for the dlc to come out and people are like "YO WHERE THE FUCK IS THE DLC"
[2:30:02] <TwistParabola> LUL
[2:30:02] <KyberNasse> Do you have the chainmail hood from those godskin dudes?
[2:30:07] <@QueequegTheater> @Pookiedaexzile They designed the Crucible Knights
[2:30:08] <NewWillinium> This is Dark Souls 2 2
[2:30:11] <+swesterly> @Pookiedaexzile who do you think made the minidungeons?
[2:30:12] <connerhozer> Amazing that the game is this big while also being so vertically dense
[2:30:13] <doster504> @Pookiedaexzile the director of 2 codirected this so
[2:30:14] <%dekkitout> Blightcon, Blightcon South, Blightcon East, and Blightcon London
[2:30:15] <sundizzle> this has so much DS2
[2:30:18] <roguemephilesclone> Dude, this game is radiating DS2 energy.
[2:30:19] <+Shikari21> this is ds2 2
[2:30:19] <%EldritchBee> Giving you a horse that can't get poisoned REALLY helps w the poison swamps
[2:30:22] <+alphonseisbest> @pookiedaexzile They MADE THIS
[2:30:23] <%TheGreatSkenardo> This is Dark Sould 4-6
[2:30:24] <Ekaelis> They worked on power stancing and all the optional bad dual bosses LUIL
[2:30:25] <Jiyairo> This game has quite a bit of DS2 influence
[2:30:26] <%Schrodingers_Box> Wonder how Paige will feel when she finds out shes the hardest boss for alot of players.
[2:30:26] <@Ranryu692> they had to have, or else this game wouldn't be out for another 5 years
[2:30:26] <Ekaelis> LUL
[2:30:31] <%Fenrisulfr_V> DS2's director co-directed this game with Miyazaki. @PatStaresAt
[2:30:33] <IminyourBase> i heard they kept DS2 devs away from fall damage
[2:30:34] <+swesterly> elden ring is 100% ds2 2
[2:30:35] <Sunstalker> I bet das 2 team worked on the chariot dungeons and putrid tree bosses D:
[2:30:37] <%Bluwizard21> which is why we have those two repeat map dungeons
[2:30:37] <%NBUsagi> that makes sense, there is a good chunk of Bloodborne in this game
[2:30:39] <Elykial> DS2 is my favorite dark souls, idc. i was even replaying it when the servers went down lmao
[2:30:41] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt The Crucible Knights feel like Tanimura took offense at people saying to skip DS2
[2:30:42] <ohno58> This feels like open world DS2 honestly...
[2:30:42] <%Zundelle> a lot of the dark souls 2 people are probably real talented it's just that a few design decisions told them to do something not that good
[2:30:44] <connerhozer> I think every team made at least some of the minidungeons
[2:30:48] <%luftraumm1> and a lift?
[2:30:48] <Ghufufin> @PatStaresAt so you're saying there is an Armored Core section?
[2:30:58] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> There it is
[2:31:04] <%radiorosewater> this is kings field
[2:31:07] <%radiorosewater> and ninja blade
[2:31:09] <TwistParabola> YEAH BOY
[2:31:12] <%Freakin_Wolfy> did pat beat the bleed boss already?
[2:31:12] <%BinaryFireball> you should read that description
[2:31:12] <+Shikari21> its time
[2:31:14] <%dekkitout> That's a lotta blank map
[2:31:14] <+alphonseisbest> The DS2 director IS the co-director on this, even if u hate ds2 gotta give him credit
[2:31:14] <roguemephilesclone> MAP GET BIGGER
[2:31:17] <%JoshManVGH> where the fuck is there another grand lift!?
[2:31:17] <KyberNasse> DS2 team prob designed the multiboss fights lol
[2:31:19] <cavefishes> both halves pog
[2:31:20] <+HuoShengdi> Time for lift, then tree ahead
[2:31:20] <IminyourBase> holy shit, the map keeps zooming out... how many hours are you into this game?
[2:31:20] <%cade_calrayn> Yup!
[2:31:20] <$Jaxnos> enjoy.
[2:31:21] <NewWillinium> THAT is the Kiln yeah
[2:31:23] <jubejube56> Time to abandon mountain?
[2:31:24] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt I suggest going to the haligtree before the kiln but that's me
[2:31:24] <+Shimano232> Pat tiem
[2:31:26] <digaogrunge> Is the Halligtree making the fog?
[2:31:26] <%luftraumm1> there's a lift back there where does it go?
[2:31:27] <%Schrodingers_Box> Select to use a different medal.
[2:31:28] <TwistParabola> yeah
[2:31:28] <cavefishes> yup
[2:31:29] <+Shimano232> item over the egde
[2:31:31] <%zaradax95> oh boy here we go
[2:31:37] <+Mrbaconator> pat DON'T get in the kiln!
[2:31:38] <heartlesshealer> Giant bowl in the sky
[2:31:39] <+swesterly> @alphonseisbest that explains a lot actually
[2:31:39] <roguemephilesclone> Oh my gosh, the shape of that unlocked map.
[2:31:41] <RubberFistFight> @Zundelle a lot of the same bad design decisions were made in this game. I've noticed a few cases of jank-ass hitboxes and good-ol DS2-brand perfect-tracking overheads.
[2:31:42] <leole11> oh boy oh boy
[2:31:44] <%BinaryFireball> oh he has both?
[2:31:45] <%BinaryFireball> nice
[2:31:48] <+Huderga> fucko shit area time
[2:31:48] <%zaradax95> pat walking straight into hell
[2:31:51] <leole11> switch actions
[2:31:51] <%JonathLP> GET OUT OF THE KILN
[2:31:51] <mr_dream__> you can see the forge when you first step out into limgrave it kinda owns
[2:31:52] <%Schrodingers_Box> Can Kill Kiln Boss without getting in the Kiln
[2:31:52] <joodatious> lmao i made that mistake
[2:31:53] <%Monkeyweed21> get outta the Kiln!
[2:31:56] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt Also did you kill the lord of blood?
[2:31:57] <@QueequegTheater> But I wanna get in the kiln
[2:31:57] <+Nomenanza> why is it always kiln
[2:31:57] <IminyourBase> is this anor lando?
[2:32:01] <oda_flobunaga> yarp
[2:32:05] <oz19999> wait, what do I do?
[2:32:06] <NewWillinium> It took me hours of wandering around to find out that is where you used it
[2:32:07] <Mechazoic_Era> get hoistin
[2:32:07] <%Cozy90> I'm really excited for this.
[2:32:08] <TwistParabola> yep
[2:32:11] <Wakerz140> I had to look up how to actually use the haligtree medallion
[2:32:13] <jubejube56> Hoist your super secret medallion
[2:32:13] <%AHomeschoolDropout> bruh it took me over an hour to try and find out how to use that damn medallion
[2:32:13] <leole11> you can warp to the lord of blood from this area
[2:32:16] <+alphonseisbest> @swesterly doesn't it just
[2:32:22] <%NopeBadguy> you can hoist the normal medallion! or you can hoist the mystery box
[2:32:22] <bassoontyphoon> “Now Homer, don’t get in that Kiln”
[2:32:23] <+FlappySeal_> hold up the cookie
[2:32:24] <%dekkitout> Wait, is this that place under- no that might've been someone else's stream I saw
[2:32:25] <+eldritchtea> YOOO I DIDNT KNOW THIS EXISTED
[2:32:29] <%Valdorick> But what if the Unkindled is in the kiln, then I should get in the kiln?
[2:32:29] <+BloodyBurney> there are 3 games about how getting in the kiln is the bad idea
[2:32:35] <%Schrodingers_Box> Kiln boss to unlock the Bonfire then do this place....since its gonna be harder
[2:32:36] <%Niney_Who> Niney_Who subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 39 months, currently on a 39 month streak! Time to go to the fucked Zone

[2:42:35] <JossyJoestar> Was that in another souls game or am I thnking of Fable?
[2:42:36] <Saturation_Lizard> do a bunch of dragon shit and you get snake eyes
[2:42:39] <oda_flobunaga> And they go catty if you go Dragon
[2:42:42] <leole11> @leole11 i need to watch that

[2:43:24] <TheSandmanIsHere> you got a face full of octopussy
[2:43:30] <leole11> this area is supposed to be super mega end game, the damage numbers are adjusted for that

[2:43:51] <$Jaxnos> i'mma be real, i think it would've been hilarious if they made that floor you just jumped down to fake. this is why i'll never be a dev.
[2:43:54] <%AHomeschoolDropout> @PatStaresAt Real talk why do all women I see play this 14 minus Paige pick fem-au'ra?
[2:44:03] <%luftraumm1> well pat IS super endgame level
[2:44:06] <joodatious> @leole11 its also optional end game which means they just say fuck it like usual and make it super fuck you hard
[2:44:11] <leole11> you missed a lever
[2:44:17] <%Fenrisulfr_V> There was also a lever there
[2:44:18] <PenguinPall> The lever is under the octopus
[2:44:18] <cavefishes> MIYAZAKIIIII
[2:44:21] <joodatious> optional stuff in souls games are usually the hardest parts

[2:44:43] <leole11> you get something really cool :)
[2:44:43] <%Felhad> Wanna know?
[2:44:45] <sirrice77> @leole11 someone said earlier that it seems that it's actually scaled for ng+ because it's bugged
[2:44:47] <%MaybeFalco> you get scrimblo bimblo
[2:45:00] <%Monkeyweed21> gurranq sucks your dick or w/e
[2:45:01] <%Valdorick> Yes
[2:45:07] <cavefishes> i'm more interested in the all remembrances run than any%
[2:45:09] <leole11> @leole11 that might make sense, my 60 VIG run was getting one shotted by a couple enemies
[2:45:21] <%BinaryFireball> ill be sad when the boss skips are patched
[2:45:25] <T_Sasquatch> depends on the run category, any% is always memes
[2:45:27] <+imkino_> the godskin apostle ai break isnt in the new route
[2:45:32] <DramaticTension> Speedrunners will just only ever run 1.0 so patching will do nothing
[2:45:32] <%Valdorick> I'm interested in Glitchless speedrun myself.
[2:45:37] <chowndawg> speedruns usually run whatever version is fastest
[2:45:38] <+ReallyBigRocks> YEAH STAB THAT KID
[2:45:43] <%luftraumm1> lever under octopussy
[2:45:51] <digaogrunge> the lever
[2:45:51] <+imkino_> new route doesnt go to rykard for the wrong warp
[2:45:51] <ohno58> STOP TEACHING THE OCTOPUSSIES
[2:45:54] <%Valdorick> Also, if its faster, they'd likely just revert to old patches.
[2:45:56] <%Fenrisulfr_V> I'm really interested in All Remembrances or Any% - no Wrong Warp.
[2:45:57] <%AHomeschoolDropout> what bosses are actually required to beat the game minus the final ones?
[2:45:58] <%crot454> the new route is new route o
[2:46:01] <+imkino_> it goes to some cave in altus that does the same glitch
[2:46:02] <NewWillinium> Glitchless Speedrun is what I am interested in watching as well yeah
[2:46:14] <oda_flobunaga> Octopustules
[2:46:17] <TwistParabola> lever is above iirc
[2:46:17] <rosabellamelantha> lever is above
[2:46:19] <cavefishes> i mean the only godskin fight in the route is duo
[2:46:20] <connerhozer> love the idea that gnomes are gurranqs most tresured students
[2:46:21] <%Valdorick> @AHomeschoolDropout With Wrongwarping... The final boss.
[2:46:35] <%Zundelle> excited for an ocarina of time tier wrong warp where you fight the tree sentinel and then go straight to the credits
[2:46:42] <%BinaryFireball> yea glitch runs are more about finding the glitches then doing cool things fast I feel
[2:46:45] <leole11> lmao nice
[2:46:45] <%Valdorick> @AHomeschoolDropout Without, uh... 4 of them, the last 4.
[2:46:52] <+imkino_> @AHomeschoolDropout theres like 5 bosses in the speedrun, all the ones right before the final boss and the final boss
[2:46:58] <Hoaxfish> Konami: Hit the Lever

[2:47:06] <Omenaire_> that thing has an assload of health
[2:47:06] <%Mantorok06> I sometimes find speed runs asinine as most of them do glitches to get what they want
[2:47:15] <blue8moon> that's a dangerous tentacle-monster
[2:47:26] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @Mantorok06 ...That's the point.
[2:47:28] <+ReallyBigRocks> wonder
[2:47:36] <+muushies> wow I didn't explore this place for shit lol
[2:47:40] <+alphonseisbest> As juice
[2:47:43] <%BinaryFireball> to do glitches?
[2:47:44] <NewWillinium> I don't think I ever changed my Physic from the Damage Bubble and Health Pickmeup
[2:47:46] <KyberNasse> Does anyone know how much does the Crucible armor boost the Crucible incants?
[2:47:47] <oda_flobunaga> Pat probally has ligma in his Physic
[2:47:50] <%radiorosewater> @Mantorok06 ??? that's why the glitchless% exists
[2:48:01] <%EldritchBee> It's for the elevator
[2:48:01] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> no just to drop the elevator down if needed
[2:48:02] <%BinaryFireball> its just the elevator lever
[2:48:03] <ape_hawk> mimic... lever?
[2:48:05] <joodatious> whats ligma?
[2:48:05] <TwistParabola> it
[2:48:05] <%cade_calrayn> no, you've just not triggered the elevator
[2:48:08] <TwistParabola> it's for the elevator
[2:48:09] <leole11> i really like that shield
[2:48:10] <%luftraumm1> calling elevator
[2:48:12] <%cade_calrayn> it's to bring the elevator back down
[2:48:24] <%cade_calrayn> and that goes out to the exit I believe
[2:48:33] <%cade_calrayn> it drops down onto the staircase of the first room
[2:48:42] <Admiral_PopnFresh> nice helmet
[2:48:45] <%TheGreatSkenardo> wasn't there a jump off point on that elevator?
[2:48:47] <%Mantorok06> Glitchless speedruns you say? I like the sound of that
[2:48:53] <DramaticTension> let them fight
[2:49:02] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> ROUND 2
[2:49:06] <BYAKURENLOVER763> doppelganger rematch!
[2:49:08] <%Bluwizard21> shit i missed this
[2:49:11] <Gorgs7> Nega-Pat
[2:49:12] <%Valdorick> Aw, no hot Mimic Tear on Mimic Tear action.
[2:49:18] <doster504> Greggory
[2:49:19] <%luftraumm1> Gregg????
[2:49:21] <%Valdorick> This one isn't +10, so Tiche.
[2:49:22] <ohno58> shoulve walked in naked
[2:49:23] <Tempmael> cage match, taking bets?
[2:49:25] <Saturation_Lizard> i actually like that they give you a round 2 at endgame so that you can throw a REAL build at yourself
[2:49:28] <Big_Dream> mimc tear is strongest summon
[2:49:31] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> unfortunately, the mimic fight doesnt bring in copies of player summons
[2:49:32] <IminyourBase> pokemon battle
[2:49:35] <+imkino_> mimic has heals so I assume that one
[2:49:35] <connerhozer> The is Greg's Vergil
[2:49:38] <%Mantorok06> Tiche for the gold
[2:49:39] <Sunstalker> Astel is a realy shitty boss for melee. Glad I can pull out dragonrot on bosses like that
[2:49:43] <+Shimano232> Pat, did you know if you un-equip everything before fighting a mimic tear the boss is EZ as shit.
[2:49:47] <XxMoliciousxX> depends on the equipment I guess
[2:49:53] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt You havent seen double greatshield mimic in action have you? That shit is beast
[2:49:55] <+Rofiarf> flonk!
[2:49:57] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> "weak enemy ahead"
[2:49:57] <%EldritchBee> bunk amon
[2:49:59] <%boggsz12> flomk
[2:49:59] <%BinaryFireball> astel made me cry as I got 1shot so often
[2:49:59] <$SGrim> lufumba?
[2:50:00] <rommlll> blackamon
[2:50:01] <connerhozer> Amon from the Yakuza series
[2:50:02] <DramaticTension> Do you summon on eveery boss first try? FeelsBadMan
[2:50:02] <sirrice77> @Sunstalker really? i had zero trouble as melee aside from the grab
[2:50:04] <+ReallyBigRocks> I've been reading that having a lot of sorceries can confuse the mimic tear, it works better with unga bunga
[2:50:06] <NewWillinium> Amon is cool. He's like a tankier, less mobile Tiche
[2:50:06] <Admiral_PopnFresh> your buddy is too powerful
[2:50:06] <Oxybe> good reading
[2:50:07] <$drabberfaun535> i missed this boss :D
[2:50:07] <oda_flobunaga> Badonkadonk Amon
[2:50:11] <Ghufufin> blaflamingo!
[2:50:12] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt Tiche is actually really bad in NG+ because only the mimic scales to your current HP and defenses
[2:50:16] <AdmiralButtloaf> Amon, at your service
[2:50:25] <+Nomenanza> wow what a great summon "he is a coward piece of shit"
[2:50:26] <+swesterly> astel was super tough but he was learnable
[2:50:34] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> Yes
[2:50:34] <TwistParabola> Amon, aka Fandaniel
[2:50:35] <rosabellamelantha> yes
[2:50:47] <%TheGreatSkenardo> is that balcony jumpable?
[2:50:50] <%Monkeyweed21> Mimic scales with you forever
[2:50:51] <%AHomeschoolDropout> Does that Ash have a fancy hat?
[2:50:52] <%MaybeFalco> cant believe they put fandaniel in elden ring
[2:51:00] <domukujira> thats sad
[2:51:04] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> Tiche really can't handle the damage that NG+ deals
[2:51:09] <joodatious> fuck fandaniel
[2:51:10] <cavefishes> mimic is cool as shit even if it is kinda busted
[2:51:11] <+alphonseisbest> Pat did u know Mimic also sucks your dick in ng+ too Kappa
[2:51:13] <joodatious> destroy that dumb twink
[2:51:14] <leole11> reload the area
[2:51:16] <sundizzle> mimic tear is just as busted with spells, since it can just heal you too

[2:59:18] <ohno58> Why do those wolves have five hit combos?
[2:59:18] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> perhaps waypoint markers can help navigate
[2:59:25] <XxMoliciousxX> mounted archers? didn't someone conquer most of eurasia with those?

[3:12:00] <%Maids4lyfe> they said watch your back
[3:12:01] <%Fenrisulfr_V> ...I didn't know she was there and was never attacked by her lmao
[3:12:01] <+Nomenanza> actually not THOSE ghosts. The locations and mobs differ from ones you see before going into evergaol. Which is a weird ass decision
[3:12:06] <+ReallyBigRocks> fucking sick
[3:12:07] <Ekaelis> Remember DS2 misty forest? LUL
[3:12:07] <%Schrodingers_Box> Use the Hip Torch
[3:12:07] <leole11> only the assassin
[3:12:08] <%nip_nips> i did not have the torch
[3:12:09] <joodatious> i did this without torch lol
[3:12:15] <joodatious> just run honestly
[3:12:19] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> darn, they shouldnt have told pat that
[3:12:19] <leole11> i did this without the torch too
[3:12:20] <+MarkoTolstov> Once, that guy just stabbed me, then before I can heal he grabbed me AGAIN and killed me. Almost threw my controller LUL
[3:12:22] <MartyFun11> Don't worry, candles stay lit up between attempts
[3:12:24] <+croutonian> yea didnt know about the torch thing lmao
[3:12:25] <+ReallyBigRocks> so much scrimblo
[3:12:26] <%justcallmebobplease> You missed an item there Pat
[3:12:26] <Augus7717> i didnt know the torch did that...
[3:12:27] <+BlandSpice> I think the blue torches by the ladders will reveal her, but they're very low-range
[3:12:29] <ArgentUndaCova> I didn't know about the torch strat
[3:12:30] <joodatious> @Schrodingers_Box it has to be sentry torch
[3:12:31] <%justcallmebobplease> On that last roof you jumped off
[3:12:33] <micolash28> the first 75% of this game is amazing, the final 25% has too much bullshit
[3:12:40] <+scumbudy> I didn't know about the torch when I did this area. So much pain
[3:12:43] <+HuoShengdi> just running only helps if you know where you're going
[3:12:49] <+croutonian> honestly its not that bad without the torch, its just the floor is lava
[3:12:51] <cavefishes> yeah the staying lit thing made this actually reasonable ahaha
[3:12:53] <+ATorL> the black knives aren't even the bad part
[3:12:55] <+Rofiarf> early game
[3:12:56] <%nip_nips> even running they can still catch up to you
[3:13:01] <$Jaxnos> they're only in like 4 spots, so after i got stabbed 4 times i knew where they were
[3:13:01] <TwistParabola> a merchant?
[3:13:01] <%Felhad> merchant I think
[3:13:03] <+alphonseisbest> @micolash28 ...so a normal fromsoft game then
[3:13:04] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> you bought it stream 1
[3:13:04] <leole11> random merchant in altus plateau
[3:13:04] <%MaybeFalco> sentry torch was bought off a merchant i believe in altus
[3:13:05] <MartyFun11> In Altus plateau
[3:13:06] <Jiyairo> You purchase it from the Liurna academymerchant I believe
[3:13:07] <Ashecroft> Bought it from Kale most likely
[3:13:10] <+BlandSpice> Merchant in altus sells it I think
[3:13:12] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> he picked it up from steve jobs
[3:13:14] <ergulor> yeah you bought it
[3:13:15] <senfood> A wandering merchant near Volcano Mansion, I think.
[3:13:18] <%luftraumm1> i think you got it at the capital
[3:13:20] <+ATorL> those archers are the bad part
[3:13:21] <%G_476> bought it from a merchant in Altus, I think
[3:13:27] <Jiyairo> Oh Altus plateau shack yeah
[3:13:31] <KyberNasse> Scrimblo found you
[3:13:33] <%nip_nips> he got moves
[3:13:38] <%MaybeFalco> my advice is to just run
[3:13:41] <%crot454> lol
[3:13:41] <%Niney_Who> Yeah this place is like
[3:13:41] <%BlueLunecy> Oh yeah
[3:13:43] <STORMWIZARD1> HaHaHa
[3:13:43] <%Felhad> lololololol
[3:13:43] <Saturation_Lizard> they aren't worth fighting
[3:13:44] <TwistParabola> yeah
[3:13:44] <%Niney_Who> Shrine of Amana o ncrack
[3:13:44] <+HuoShengdi> I believe if you kill the black knife she stays dead
[3:13:45] <+Rofiarf> just run
[3:13:47] <athuramn> she*
[3:13:47] <NewHamwall> Yo John Cena just beat your ass
[3:13:47] <+Tredecian> i didnt know you could use a torch
[3:13:48] <scrumbotime> oh so those are the guys you need the torch to see
[3:13:50] <%Pookiedaexzile> What Part of Invisible didn't Click
[3:13:50] <ohno58> that guy lied
[3:13:50] <$Jaxnos> this is a stealth mission.
[3:13:54] <%Zeroblazex> Violence probably isn’t the answer
[3:13:54] <%abakkus> turbohell
[3:13:54] <TwistParabola> they dont respawn thankfully
[3:13:55] <+alphonseisbest> THATS EVIL EVILLLLLLL
[3:13:57] <oda_flobunaga> GOOD LUCK Kappa
[3:13:57] <heartlesshealer> can't target what you can't see
[3:13:58] <MartyFun11> If you're smart you can avoid all of the assassins
[3:13:59] <jell_ree> u can only see him with the torch
[3:14:00] <%Maids4lyfe> they said they stay invisible
[3:14:00] <%Puhff> You got it back in Fomunda
[3:14:02] <+HuoShengdi> but yeah not worth fighting
[3:14:03] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> 100% invisiblessed
[3:14:03] <reasonance> it's kinda BS how much poise those guys despite being lightweight assassins
[3:14:06] <%Willowight> oh, she gets for real invisible
[3:14:10] <spinningchurro> Not totally invisible but close enough.
[3:14:17] <+BlandSpice> @Tredecian Has to be the item "sentinel's torch" it has a description mentioning it reveals the invisible
[3:14:20] <%Felhad> Violence is always an answer, if you have enough violence
[3:14:20] <ohno58> you can do it without ever fighting them if ur sneaky
[3:14:24] <some_brave_apollo> this entire area is unbearable
[3:14:30] <+Nomenanza> also no idea why they put barriers in THIS version of the town. They'd be much more useful in evergaol
[3:14:31] <joodatious> @reasonance i mean they killed a demigod..
[3:14:32] <Jace_Keats> I'm sorry multiple assassins?
[3:14:33] <%TheGreatSkenardo> this town kind of sucks dawg
[3:14:36] <%Zeroblazex> @felhad touché
[3:14:39] <leole11> @Tredecian there's also a hint a merchant sells that alludes to a torch being able to do that
[3:14:49] <%Zeroblazex> THE CHEESE
[3:14:56] <domukujira> its not bad if u know where the ladders are
[3:15:14] <+Rofiarf> lefter
[3:15:14] <joodatious> this area is not too hard honestly. once you know where to go its just a run
[3:15:19] <oda_flobunaga> On your left
[3:15:21] <leole11> what a mistery
[3:15:29] <%luftraumm1> its gotta be at night is that it?
[3:15:29] <ohno58> that child statue has a big ass head
[3:15:32] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> hey chat shut up
[3:15:33] <cavefishes> one is on ground level
[3:15:36] <%Zeroblazex> This part sucks..
[3:15:39] <%Felhad> Be wary of archers ahead
[3:15:48] <$Jaxnos> all of Latenna's sisters are way better than her
[3:15:48] <joodatious> yes
[3:15:49] <cavefishes> dung ahead
[3:15:51] <rosabellamelantha> yes
[3:15:54] <RubberFistFight> we told you this place sucked lol
[3:15:54] <sirrice77> arrows do so much goddamn damage
[3:15:55] <oda_flobunaga> They may have gone too far in some places
[3:15:57] <cavefishes> YEAH
[3:15:58] <Saturation_Lizard> this is shrine of amana on cocaine
[3:15:59] <+Nomenanza> "what if Anor Londo archers had a machine gun"
[3:16:02] <scrumbotime> Try Finger But Hole
[3:16:02] <heartlesshealer> ah, those placements... of course the archers will be assholes
[3:16:06] <+Stormzcales_Lair> Wow look at this cool shit i'll see next month
[3:16:08] <%abakkus> hey. hey pat. there's enemies in that dungeon.
[3:16:09] <%Valdorick> Try Ranged Battle

[3:16:11] <KyberNasse> Pincushioned
[3:16:11] <%nip_nips> DONT GET HIT BY THAT BOMB
[3:16:12] <+aaymon86> So.... Pat is not overleveled
[3:16:18] <jubejube56> What if the archers had a machine gun with homing ammo
[3:16:19] <%Monkeyweed21> WOLVES HUNT IN PACKS ARISEN
[3:16:20] <+AyupaPupa> idk if you saw the archers
[3:16:20] <sundizzle> you can try to plan out a route before you go in
[3:16:20] <+Nomenanza> "JC a bomb!"
[3:16:22] <spinningchurro> Shield useful ahead.
[3:16:24] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt it's legit one of my favourite jokes.
[3:16:25] <%G_476> JC, a bomb!
[3:16:25] <$bcdenton> Oh my god JC, a bomb!
[3:16:25] <Paperware> They should stay lit once you touch them so you don't need to get all of them in one run
[3:16:28] <heartlesshealer> JC a bomb!
[3:16:28] <Giztech> @PatStaresAt it's easy if you holdem
[3:16:30] <%Maids4lyfe> LUL

[3:16:33] <%Felhad> LOOK OUT FOR THAT DRAGON
[3:16:33] <%nip_nips> what a shame
[3:16:34] <+KipTheSmuggler> wow pat and woolie are BOTH playing with equal viewership
[3:16:35] <%Monkeyweed21> THEIR KIND HATES ICE AND FIRE BOTH
[3:16:35] <%Valdorick> I have a hint... They're weak to Greatbows.
[3:16:40] <sirrice77> @aaymon86 It's more that endgame enemies simply do so much damage it doesn't matter what level you are
[3:16:44] <%Pukenasty> if your hp reaches zero you die
[3:16:46] <$Jaxnos> Pat is not overlevelled for the secret optional areas, it's true.
[3:16:47] <joodatious> @Paperware they do stay lit
[3:16:49] <%Freakin_Wolfy> Try scouting the area before you spawn the boss strength enemies
[3:16:54] <Namillus> Oh christ an entire city inside an Evergaol? Fuck
[3:16:56] <%pinkslimegoblin> be careful there's invisible enemies @PatStaresAt
[3:16:58] <%Zundelle> WOLVES HUNT IN PACKS
[3:16:58] <cavefishes> those two fuckers are the new anor londo archers
[3:17:05] <RubberFistFight> @sirrice77 endgame seems massively overtuned tbh
[3:17:06] <%Pookiedaexzile> BackStab
[3:17:09] <scrumbotime> dog puzzles
[3:17:12] <%luftraumm1> nope
[3:17:13] <+Rofiarf> what is?
[3:17:13] <%abakkus> is what too loud
[3:17:14] <%Xevtes> no
[3:17:14] <%twohitgood> not too loud for me
[3:17:14] <+twdlrr> nah
[3:17:16] <Nordguy> what is
[3:17:16] <%crot454> is what too loud?
[3:17:18] <%AHomeschoolDropout> @PatStaresAt Which Male Viera face has the most tired eyes
[3:17:20] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> does a lantern count for visibility?
[3:17:22] <TwistParabola> what is
[3:17:22] <%Maids4lyfe> she
[3:17:24] <%MaybeFalco> is it the coffee maker or some shit?
[3:17:24] <Augus7717> what is?
[3:17:25] <jbrachob> it's literally drax yelling "look out!" a full second after mantis gets smashed by a rock in guardians of the galaxy 2
[3:17:28] <heartlesshealer> no, also that backstab barely did anything
[3:17:29] <%Maids4lyfe> those assassins are women
[3:17:38] <spinningchurro> Does the lantern work?
[3:17:39] <+Stormzcales_Lair> y no bloodborne lanturn
[3:17:41] <%Pookiedaexzile> Would the Lantern do the same thing as teh torch
[3:17:45] <%luftraumm1> this place seems designed to fuck with shield users
[3:17:54] <%retrohazard> He's doing it
[3:17:58] <senfood> The yassiification of god slaying assassins.
[3:17:59] <%retrohazard> He's beginning to believe
[3:18:02] <+Nomenanza> @Pookiedaexzile nah you need a special torch
[3:18:02] <jubejube56> They are cool and all but they also killed Iji so.....
[3:18:05] <scrumbotime> Glovewort nine, nice
[3:18:06] <%EriksBlue> nice
[3:18:06] <TwistParabola> yayyyyy
[3:18:08] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt she stays dead I believe
[3:18:11] <TwistParabola> lets gooooo
[3:18:12] <heartlesshealer> good job, you beat one
[3:18:13] <eleskei> they dont have gigantic tiddies and arent wearing a bikini so they cant be women
[3:18:18] <%Freakin_Wolfy> lol, pat really playing hard mode over here
[3:18:19] <eleskei> stop lying
[3:18:28] <Augus7717> Pat watch out its invisible
[3:18:28] <%justcallmebobplease> Just going to ignore that item pat?
[3:18:33] <sirrice77> @RubberFistFight i personally wouldn't say massively but yeah overtuned. Like there's always several things endgame stuff does that are hard to deal with when really giving them one or two of those was enough to make it hard
[3:18:35] <ergulor> was that a item?
[3:18:35] <jubejube56> okay so I know we saw that
[3:18:41] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> big brain geif
[3:18:41] <TwistParabola> ?
[3:18:41] <+Rofiarf> give him the controller then
[3:18:47] <ape_hawk> zangief beat the game before you did
[3:18:51] <+ReallyBigRocks> NotLikeThis can
[3:18:54] <%justcallmebobplease> Sure was an item, right when he jumped and broke the boxes.
[3:18:56] <+Nomenanza> lol
[3:18:58] <%MaybeFalco> gief smort, gief can beat elden ring
[3:18:59] <ArgentUndaCova> Good job Zangief doodGood
[3:19:01] <TwistParabola> ohhhhh
[3:19:01] <+BloodyBurney> bold to walk around with half hp
[3:19:02] <+ReallyBigRocks> can't believe pat would ignore the scrimblo
[3:19:04] <heartlesshealer> the toy puzzle
[3:19:08] <+imthinkingdarbys> get a big brain for gief
[3:19:11] <scrumbotime> sit 'gief down with a blackboard and chalk and tell him "you'll get ham if you solve global warming"
[3:19:16] <%Felhad> Let Gief play Elden Ring, coward
[3:19:17] <cavefishes> elden ring is just a doggie puzzle for pat
[3:19:17] <leole11> the dog puzzle? dozzle?
[3:19:27] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> i had gief beat outer wilds for me the other day
[3:19:36] <RubberFistFight> @sirrice77 the two cleanrot knights flanking the corrupted erdtree avatar on the platform with ballista dudes right before that one grace spot was pure sadism. like wtf were they thinking.
[3:19:36] <%pinkslimegoblin> is that why you got this game?
[3:19:38] <oda_flobunaga> If Pat 1 shots Rot Mommy how salty will we all be?
[3:19:38] <jbrachob> what BRAIN?
[3:19:42] <%Bluwizard21> this area is cancer
[3:19:45] <%G_476> Do you have an anti-magic shield?
[3:19:51] <cavefishes> you were on the right route
[3:19:51] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @oda_flobunaga I would be.
[3:19:52] <@Spydurman> watch out for archers
[3:19:59] <%MaybeFalco> @oda_flobunaga extremely, but its not gonna happen
[3:20:01] <%Fenrisulfr_V> Took me two days of attempts and giga cheese to beat her
[3:20:03] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> gief is getting too smart
[3:20:13] <RubberFistFight> @oda_flobunaga probably a new record for salt levels would be set.
[3:20:14] <rosabellamelantha> @oda_flobunaga he can probably do it if Mimic keeps ALL her attention
[3:20:16] <sirrice77> @RubberFistFight yeah turns out you can go to the side and then drop down and run past which is what i did
[3:20:20] <%MaybeFalco> yup
[3:20:25] <NewWillinium> Once a Statue is lit it stays lit
[3:20:26] <rosabellamelantha> Yes
[3:20:31] <Augus7717> yes
[3:20:32] <%Felhad> You're doing it right @patstaresat
[3:20:34] <Augus7717> its the only way
[3:20:35] <%Felhad> it just sucks
[3:20:36] <cavefishes> you have to get up on the roof with the archer
[3:20:37] <sephyrs> theres another way
[3:20:38] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt Yes you were on the right path, you just have to deal with that anor londo shit
[3:20:39] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt there is but it's in a spot you wouldn't think to look.
[3:20:52] <cavefishes> you were doing it right before you tried to jump on the balcony
[3:20:55] <%MaybeFalco> if you have a great bow or ballista you can knock them out of LoS
[3:21:00] <leole11> just dodge
[3:21:00] <%Zeroblazex> When you’re doing it right it’s SUPPOSED to feel wrong
[3:21:02] <cavefishes> the ladder is right next to the left archer
[3:21:02] <jubejube56> If only torrent were here :/
[3:21:03] <%jamsbybetty> this area feels like the process to unlock a dlc
[3:21:06] <fishmonger555> I've had luck climbing on the rubble
[3:21:11] <Saturation_Lizard> anor-amana
[3:21:15] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt Sentry torch out or these assassins will just instakill you
[3:21:27] <%justcallmebobplease> perhaps illusory, below the seemingly pointless ladder?
[3:21:31] <%Valdorick> Oh my god, that blood stain pile
[3:21:50] <+Shikari21> Ni e
[3:21:52] <+Shikari21> Nice
[3:21:54] <%Felhad> PREY SLAUGHTERED
[3:21:55] <%MaybeFalco> thats the hardest part fortunately
[3:21:56] <cavefishes> NICE
[3:21:56] <joodatious> hard part over
[3:21:56] <ArgentUndaCova> Goddamn these archers mopSweat
[3:21:57] <+Stormzcales_Lair> fkn slyvanusses

[3:26:01] <%Felhad> @patstaresat Theres no such thing as a weak enemy post-Lyndell
[3:26:02] <%Zeroblazex> Both giants to die to a tiny sword
[3:26:02] <TwistParabola> explosive crossbows!
[3:26:03] <Oxybe> something was done about it
[3:26:10] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> HUGE BRAIN
[3:26:12] <%notsoy> yeah that sounds like the zangief approach
[3:26:13] <%Freakin_Wolfy> just like his dad
[3:26:16] <+Stormzcales_Lair> LUL
[3:26:16] <Morsuzado> sounds like a bull dog
[3:26:16] <oz19999> that's how my dog solved his
[3:26:17] <+twdlrr> just like his mom would
[3:26:17] <%notsoy> use STR not INT
[3:26:18] <ohno58> just destroy the puzzle
[3:26:21] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> brute smarts for the win
[3:26:21] <+ReallyBigRocks> Dogs don't understand the concept of puzzle
[3:26:24] <%Pookiedaexzile> Zangief Learned Brute Smarts
[3:26:25] <%jamsbybetty> brute smarts
[3:26:26] <%Monkeyweed21> like mother like son
[3:26:27] <+Massimoman64> just like his mother
[3:26:28] <+ReallyBigRocks> they just eat
[3:26:28] <Ghufufin> adventurer standard solution
[3:26:29] <knotsundownsyndrome> he learned his unga well from his bunga father
[3:26:29] <%sniffy77> IGNORE BRAIN USE BRAWN
[3:26:29] <Gorgs7> sounds like the correct solution
[3:26:32] <+twdlrr> brute smarts always wins
[3:26:35] <%abakkus> work smarter not harder
[3:26:40] <%Felhad> He used the Paige Solution
[3:26:40] <%luftraumm1> Brute Smarts just like his mother
[3:26:42] <%Zundelle> puzzle defeated, forever
[3:26:54] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> you can just smack em to stop it
[3:26:55] <%Freakin_Wolfy> Zangief going that Strength/faith build
[3:26:57] <MidnightPacif1c> to shreds you say
[3:27:01] <ArgentUndaCova> Victory Achieved PrideRise

[3:27:56] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> get them to aggro
[3:27:57] <+HateChoosingNames> Gotta be melee
[3:28:01] <%Monkeyweed21> they have to aggro

[3:30:44] <%EldritchBee> There's one of these guys outside the Volcano Manor
[3:30:54] <%Deft_Thought> Sure is a lot of Chaos in this place
[3:30:55] <ArgentUndaCova> Oh damn, didn't realise hitting them in the head staggered the madness giants super hard mopT
[3:30:56] <jubejube56> oh god frenzied rats
[3:31:16] <domukujira> CHAOS
[3:31:18] <%Felhad> @patstaresat this is another way to Mogh's Underground Ruins Adventure
[3:31:27] <%EldritchBee> MAD RATS
[3:31:29] <rosabellamelantha> RATS
[3:31:30] <TwistParabola> rats rats
[3:31:31] <leole11> he's the big rat that makes all the rules
[3:31:33] <TwistParabola> we're the rats
[3:31:34] <rosabellamelantha> WE'RE RATS
[3:31:34] <ArgentUndaCova> I must kill CHAOS
[3:31:35] <%notsoy> the rats were just getting even for all the slander you've spread about them
[3:31:38] <%cade_calrayn> Clemps has come to take revenge for you mocking the British, Pat
[3:31:40] <Ner234> ratJAM
[3:31:46] <%VeryBestPlot> kzxMonkaTg kzxMonkaTg kzxMonkaTg
[3:31:48] <KatabolicRage> yeah that caravan back there has more things to get from it at night, and only at night
[3:31:54] <%Dakuu75> "Mad Ratz" the new competitor to "Mad Catz"
[3:32:05] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> item
[3:32:09] <NewWillinium> So if one takes the Frenzied Flame, do you also get Frenzy Flame eyes?
[3:32:13] <jubejube56> lol did she just save you from a grab?
[3:32:17] <Zourath> There's nothing stopping the power of rats in a place where water freezes
[3:32:17] <%Willowight> the mad ratter
[3:32:18] <eleskei> cant believe that dude was just lying there he is not dressed for the weather
[3:32:20] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> item outside on body
[3:32:25] <zanzibarian_hamster> Man is Hatsur in charge of this place or what?
[3:32:29] <MidnightPacif1c> real greasy
[3:32:31] <%Freakin_Wolfy> the moonlight greatsword and rats with stagger are the only constants in Dark souls
[3:32:32] <Saturation_Lizard> @NewWillinium you get a lot more than eyes actually
[3:32:33] <%Freakin_Wolfy> and poison swamps
[3:32:34] <%Pookiedaexzile> Its OooKey Bubbles, I got it all figured out
[3:32:38] <zanzibarian_hamster> All the yellow crazy shit
[3:32:45] <TwistParabola> there should be a basement nearby
[3:32:46] <%geekjacob> oh god theirs more of them
[3:32:49] <ebrion> Mad Cthulhu Giants
[3:32:56] <leole11> it's there
[3:32:59] <NewWillinium> @NewWillinium I've heard that only happens *after* the game, not the game itself. Or was that untrue?
[3:33:10] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Theres another item when you killed a guy during the rukus
[3:33:12] <%Dakuu75> @PatStaresAt you think they made this zone intentionally end-game because it's harder to see messages?
[3:33:40] <%strakillias> Gief heard the word relax and freaked out lol
[3:33:54] <Hoaxfish> The puzzle looks solved to me
[3:34:01] <NewWillinium> Speaking of beating the game. . . Hoarfrost is totally going to be nerfed into the ground ain't it? I only discovered it at the final dregs of the game, but fuck did it make that final fight easier
[3:34:03] <bassoontyphoon> Gief too strong
[3:34:17] <%nip_nips> im sure they'll nerf hoarfrost
[3:34:25] <+ReallyBigRocks> why does your facecam zoom in a tiny bit for like a half second every now and again?
[3:34:31] <Omenaire_> CHAOS
[3:34:35] <%Dakuu75> Is this normal for Pat's view count? I ussually don't look and I wonder if it's becaus ehe's so far in the game now, ppl wanna dodge spoilers
[3:34:35] <%Felhad> Respec to Madness coward
[3:34:36] <joodatious> @NewWillinium hard to tell, just about every status effect in the game is broken
[3:34:41] <%nip_nips> @ReallyBigRocks trying to refocus?
[3:34:48] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt I actually think the original frenzy flame is better than this because this has animation lock
[3:34:52] <joodatious> this game follows the "if everything is broken nothing is"
[3:34:52] <senfood> Can be used while in motion!
[3:34:52] <ape_hawk> can be used while moving
[3:35:05] <%Dakuu75> wouldn't madness jsut be arcane?
[3:35:05] <%Felhad> Dont the incants need higher ARC?
[3:35:10] <MartyFun11> By the way, there's a mines along the cliffside here
[3:35:12] <+ReallyBigRocks> @nip_nips ahh yeah that makes sense
[3:35:14] <%notsoy> what are the odds an invisible floor is around here
[3:35:15] <rosabellamelantha> yeah
[3:35:17] <NewWillinium> @NewWillinium Cold Spells and Cold Weapons CARRIED my Mage throughout like. . . 80% of my playthrough. I can't imagine how broken Bleed and the others are.
[3:35:21] <sundizzle> there is also a mine relatively close
[3:35:35] <domukujira> there more
[3:35:39] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt check out the trees next to the ruins
[3:35:40] <%Felhad> @dakuu75 Depends, goes up to 1.2-1.5k sometimes
[3:35:47] <+ReallyBigRocks> watch out for that landmine
[3:35:57] <rosabellamelantha> Oh this one SUCKs
[3:36:01] <ohno58> yolo tunnel
[3:36:02] <rosabellamelantha> mostly because of the boss
[3:36:03] <MartyFun11> Oh yeah this one is fun
[3:36:03] <TwistParabola> oh yeah THIS one
[3:36:05] <%Dakuu75> I looked up what changes ppl's eye colors. aparently it has to do with stuff like, how much dragon magic you use or blood magic and stuff like that
[3:36:14] <sundizzle> oh have fun
[3:36:15] <+ReallyBigRocks> Anix Kappa
[3:36:20] <%Valdorick> This one is the BEST
[3:36:20] <%Felhad> PAIN AHEAD
[3:36:21] <%nip_nips> thats this whole game pat
[3:36:22] <oda_flobunaga> Fuck this one
[3:36:23] <+AyupaPupa> try fingers this hole
[3:36:23] <joodatious> i hope they dont go around nerfing stuff. I swear whenever something is ACTUALLY USEFUL this community will complain that it needs to be nerfed
[3:36:24] <NewWillinium> And thankfully the game does not dump you immediately into New-Game _
[3:36:25] <sundizzle> the ice caves are super cool though, wish there were more
[3:36:26] <%tetraes> i like this one
[3:36:27] <TwistParabola> LUL
[3:36:28] <NewWillinium> +
[3:36:34] <%HiroProtagonest> Turns out the whole game sucks, damn
[3:36:35] <NewWillinium> Oh this one? This one is easy though
[3:36:36] <sirrice77> Nah this one is cool
[3:36:37] <+ReallyBigRocks> this is the easiest cave in the game
[3:36:37] <ebrion> This is a Skyrim ass cave
[3:36:38] <ohno58> the whole second half of the game is basically the fuck zone
[3:36:40] <ArgentUndaCova> Horse but hole
[3:36:42] <$drabberfaun535> yeah the last 20% of this game didnt need to hit so hard
[3:36:43] <KyberNasse> This wasnt so bad
[3:36:43] <XxMoliciousxX> cus they do, want us to lie?
[3:36:43] <%Dakuu75> doodMash doodMash doodMash doodMash doodBurst
[3:36:45] <%Fenrisulfr_V> That's just kind of how the end-game zones are. Some people fucking hate them.
[3:36:50] <Explodincatz> Skyrim Cave
[3:36:58] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> the gaslight swamp
[3:37:01] <Augus7717> the gaslight dungeons are pain but that's it
[3:37:06] <%Zundelle> you won't BELIEVE what's in this area, it killed my entire clan and family and also my dog, now I have to find Itachi
[3:37:06] <rosabellamelantha> I like this cave I just hate the boss of this for personal reasons
[3:37:13] <XxMoliciousxX> sewers?
[3:37:14] <joodatious> yeah
[3:37:14] <DestroPrime83> I was ljust thinking wow this is a Skyrim
[3:37:17] <+Nomenanza> I felt my enthusiasm kinda drain at giants' mountain
[3:37:18] <TwistParabola> gaslight catacombs though
[3:37:24] <leole11> oh right... this boss
[3:37:32] <rosabellamelantha> yeah
[3:37:40] <ape_hawk> draugrs? you mean 90% of the enemies in skyrim?
[3:37:44] <xDartuzax> I found it bad because for 98% of my run I didn't use a greatshield
[3:37:48] <leole11> hehehe
[3:37:48] <rosabellamelantha> I normally don't mind the reuse but here...
[3:37:48] <+OneTrueAsshat> I did not expect dropping into a well to turn into a whole ass complex zone
[3:37:49] <joodatious> that dungeon is arguably the worse.
[3:37:50] <ArgentUndaCova> You're doing it Pat PrideRise
[3:37:51] <NewWillinium> This boss is fine.
[3:37:52] <eleskei> this cave looks like a good time
[3:37:56] <%Valdorick> What's here Pat. Give us your brain.
[3:38:02] <domukujira> what a fun area i hope the boss is easy :)
[3:38:03] <ergulor> a good time?
[3:38:05] <%Dakuu75> If you don't get ONE-SHOT, you're over-powered... said every one-guy
[3:38:07] <leole11> what do you think is here, pat
[3:38:09] <%shootbang_exe> tell us pat
[3:38:11] <NewWillinium> Also wow I forgot how Skyrim this dungeon is.
[3:38:12] <+ReallyBigRocks> is it satan?
[3:38:13] <joodatious> maybeee
[3:38:15] <Saturation_Lizard> correct
[3:38:19] <NewWillinium> We will not confirm or deny
[3:38:20] <%Deft_Thought> Oh, two-handing a greatsword does get through their tough body?
[3:38:20] <%EldritchBee> You killed that dude, Pat, how could it be Astel
[3:38:20] <leole11> yes, astel 2, the astelling
[3:38:23] <TwistParabola> ehhh
[3:38:27] <KyberNasse> These guys are chumps with that greatshield of yours
[3:38:27] <%MaybeFalco> its a scrimblo bimblo
[3:38:29] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt it's actually Mohg part 3
[3:38:31] <ArgentUndaCova> mopT
[3:38:33] <leole11> i liked astel :)
[3:38:34] <%Deft_Thought> I thought it had to be a blunt weapon
[3:38:35] <%EldritchBee> Astel is dead
[3:38:36] <%Valdorick> That could just be Space Elves... or Starfallen Beasts
[3:38:37] <jubejube56> I'd love it was just like.......Radahn in a small hallway
[3:38:38] <%Toast_Master_General> gl
[3:38:38] <DestroPrime83> Im playing skyrim rn because I cant play Elden Ring :)
[3:38:51] <%boggsz12> the way this is going is making me think grinding up to your level before the mountaintop areas is actually a good decision
[3:38:51] <joodatious> SPACE ELF
[3:38:55] <%EldritchBee> You're thinking of Letsa
[3:38:55] <RubberFistFight> @rosabellamelantha he hasn';t even tried mohg proper yet since that first time LUL
[3:39:01] <joodatious> i love that this game has space elves
[3:39:05] <+ReallyBigRocks> not even the boss Kappa
[3:39:06] <+croutonian> Diaper Dark Elf
[3:39:08] <%Felhad> As a Bloodborne supremacist I think Astel was the coolest boss in the game
[3:39:10] <%EldritchBee> DIAPER ELF
[3:39:13] <eleskei> slenderman
[3:39:13] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> i bet it's rodahn 2
[3:39:16] <%greasypete00> these guys are pathetically non-threatening
[3:39:16] <ArgentUndaCova> Damn this gravity man gets staggered super easily
[3:39:16] <%shootbang_exe> missed opportunity for them to put gravity squeeze in the game
[3:39:18] <%nip_nips> bitch ass gravity
[3:39:19] <%strakillias> The boss will be Worf son of Mohg
[3:39:28] <DestroPrime83> Have you heard of the High Elves?
[3:39:29] <joodatious> @boggsz12 grinding is worthless. if you want to level up just do dungeons and stuff thats where the majority of souls come from
[3:39:30] <sirrice77> oh i didn't know they were elves i just thought they were diaper giants
[3:39:31] <ape_hawk> no souls?
[3:39:33] <RubberFistFight> @Felhad agreed and I was disappointed as fuck to find out they couldn't resist copy-pasting him too.
[3:39:34] <rosabellamelantha> @Felhad I agree I just don't like them reusing the coolest boss in the game
[3:39:34] <%EldritchBee> They put Radhan in a tiny hole this time
[3:39:36] <%tetraes> The stars just being Freakbeast is my jam
[3:39:37] <%nip_nips> @strakillias LUL
[3:39:41] <%greasypete00> reverse sneeze?
[3:39:46] <%BonewheelVanguard> man, these Dark Elves suck
[3:39:47] <%Felhad> Totally fair
[3:39:50] <+ReallyBigRocks> Scrimblo, Son of Bimblo, Progenitor of the Skrunko
[3:39:53] <RubberFistFight> @rosabellamelantha me either.
[3:39:56] <%Deft_Thought> Snot goes in?
[3:39:59] <rosabellamelantha> @RubberFistFight yeah that's the thing he would be kino if they just left him alone as a one time thing
[3:40:01] <+WalkingGears> WalkingGears subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! 
[3:40:14] <NewWillinium> The Oynx Lords are literally Aliens who just adapted to live in this realm. Except for pants. They refused to adopt pants
[3:40:15] <%greasypete00> tussy
[3:40:27] <%boggsz12> @boggsz12 i've done all the dungeons up to that point and i'm not nearly pat's level lmao
[3:40:30] <+chimaera24> Yeah but that debuff is insane
[3:40:33] <some_brave_apollo> mimic does the job
[3:40:35] <RubberFistFight> @rosabellamelantha a lot of the bosses would be if they hadn't used them to pad out the game.
[3:40:37] <%Valdorick> They give you SO MANY
[3:40:38] <Halfsock> as a guy whose had 3 bulldogs growing up, i understand exactly what reverse sneezing is
[3:40:40] <ape_hawk> another one
[3:40:41] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> one downside mimic has is that they can be command grabbed
[3:40:44] <leole11> by end game i got 6
[3:40:45] <joodatious> @RubberFistFight isn't Astel just one of his weird race though?
[3:40:47] <%Valdorick> You uh... forgot to heal after falling down.
[3:40:48] <%Nobrev> good thing i leveled both tiche and mimic to 10
[3:40:50] <+imthinkingdarbys> that guy seemed tougher
[3:40:51] <bassoontyphoon> Gotta keep that mimussy close
[3:40:54] <Augus7717> you get like 5 of those at least
[3:40:56] <%nip_nips> i needed mimic tear for malenia
[3:40:57] <%Felhad> I found Tiche to be way more survivable but less damaging than my Mimic
[3:40:59] <Saturation_Lizard> yeah you're in the "better have maxed out weapons" section of the game
[3:41:02] <mrcelab> So that is a walkers from GOT?
[3:41:10] <ohno58> at the same time?
[3:41:11] <%strakillias> No the loudest is the Husky house Pat
[3:41:12] <Halfsock> they were so smelly
[3:41:12] <%EldritchBee> My dog had zero percent bulldog in him and he reverse sneezed all the time
[3:41:14] <+twdlrr> My Corgi does it a lot to
[3:41:19] <joodatious> Tiche is a dodge tank yeah
[3:41:22] <Jiyairo> Tiche can help for bleed buildup at least
[3:41:22] <%Monkeyweed21> the most adorable house
[3:41:43] <some_brave_apollo> I want to see a boss battle against a giant gravity elf guy riding a fallingstar beast in the DLC
[3:41:44] <%tetraes> @PatStaresAt  Double Husky is where loud is
[3:42:16] <Saturation_Lizard> the last bell bearing for mining stones are loot in various upcoming areas
[3:42:17] <%Maids4lyfe> my neighbor has a german shepherd that goes around visiting everyone, and sometimes he brings a bulldog with him and they like to come get their bellies rubbed
[3:42:19] <+ReallyBigRocks> I had multiple Beagle mixes growing up, those motherfuckers love making noise
[3:42:21] <%Valdorick> Wow, he's got hands
[3:42:22] <some_brave_apollo> nice
[3:42:25] <joodatious> @RubberFistFight "pad it out" its literally an optional boss though
[3:42:27] <+ScrapKingKeita> damn, you got Iron Tager'd
[3:42:27] <Omenaire_> that was badass
[3:42:30] <TwistParabola> F
[3:42:32] <AlexJacobVO> space elf
[3:42:35] <%Maids4lyfe> you almost had him
[3:42:36] <%TheGreatSkenardo> guy seems kind of for real
[3:42:39] <Paperware> You were talking mad shit about his brother being a bitch, now he's mad
[3:42:41] <leole11> there's a couple extra [8] where purple guy is
[3:42:45] <%Dakuu75> has Pat gotten a bell for buying +6-7 smithing stones? (I need that)
[3:42:51] <joodatious> this game is MASSIVE and they arguably need to reuse certain bosses
[3:42:51] <+5Two> Gollum's been hitting the weights.
[3:42:58] <zanzibarian_hamster> I've never met a husky that wasn't legitimately fucking insane
[3:43:03] <senfood> Huskies are big babies. Such giant, silly losers.
[3:43:05] <leole11> @Dakuu75 no, that's in an area he hasn't done
[3:43:16] <NewWillinium> Alright Game has been beaten. . . Time for a Faith Build!
[3:43:17] <badhaye> You jump slam 3 times it puts them in a stun state and dodges most attacks
[3:43:23] <+Ragnakawaii> Alabaster Lords are so cool
[3:43:30] <Omenaire_> i have that pull in spell, its really good for exactly that, reeling in and attacking . gravity magic is my favorite thing i think
[3:43:33] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> any good range summons (that pat has seen already) or should someone use a mimic tear with a range build?
[3:43:39] <joodatious> This game has more unique bosses then just about any game on the market anyway so its not like they lack designs
[3:43:46] <%Valdorick> You can now dual wield the Alabaster Lord Sword... for some reason.
[3:43:58] <joodatious> pat you're clearly overleveled
[3:43:58] <%Monkeyweed21> @RubberFistFight Dude you have been complaining about enemy/boss reuse in every single one of pats streams for over a week we get it
[3:44:04] <sirrice77> @I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I there are range summons, but personally i haven't checked them out
[3:44:10] <%soloshotfirst82> My cousin has always had 3 huskies at any given time and all she does is bitch about how annoying and loud they are, as if she doesn't have a choice to, you know, not constantly get huskies.
[3:44:13] <leole11> there's like 50 unique ones
[3:44:15] <%Valdorick> The boss reuse in this game is SO MUCH BETTER than fucking Dark Souls 1
[3:44:15] <%greasypete00> pat is always reading chat
[3:44:20] <TwistParabola> mood
[3:44:22] <zanzibarian_hamster> Hey, gotta complain about something
[3:44:25] <ape_hawk> "no, but its lazy to reuse assets!"
[3:44:30] <+TVs_Rob_and_Friends> "content diverse"
[3:44:33] <%EldritchBee> Plus it means you get to fight some cool ass bosses multiple times
[3:44:34] <Ekaelis> Quality vs Quantity
[3:44:35] <%Valdorick> Skyrim doesn't HAVE bosses!
[3:44:38] <%nip_nips> @Valdorick you dont miss copy pasted taurus and capra demons?
[3:44:40] <$drabberfaun535> "oh thank God it's a boss I know how to fight" is my thoughts on this
[3:44:41] <phoenix_games87> It lacks fishing  and swimming
[3:44:41] <leole11> total, yes
[3:44:43] <Omenaire_> of the greatest open world action adventure games, this triumphs every one.
[3:44:44] <+croutonian> i've fought bowser like 6 times in a single game lmao
[3:44:45] <rosabellamelantha> I'm fine with MOST boss reuse, that's fine I just don't like this one is the thing @PatStaresAt
[3:44:46] <DestroPrime83> *Cough CowboyFanboy Cough*
[3:44:47] <%delilah4you> I dont mind the boss reuse, its when you start adding 2 or 3 bosses in one fight. That shit gets oooold.
[3:44:48] <%Freakin_Wolfy> I hate that they reuse the gargoyle bosses because fuck gargoyles
[3:44:52] <ArgentUndaCova> Skyrim has dragons that are reskins of each other PepeLaugh
[3:44:53] <DramaticTension> And you get to se your mastery over the bosses
[3:44:55] <joodatious> skyrim has like maybe 4 or so unique bosses?
[3:44:56] <joodatious> maybe
[3:44:58] <+ReallyBigRocks> NotLikeThis why not 300hours of completely unique content
[3:44:59] <$drabberfaun535> or "oh no not him again"
[3:44:59] <mrcelab> SPOILER ALERT!!!!!
[3:44:59] <%radiorosewater> no pat you don't get it they want to be mad don't hurt the snowflakes
[3:44:59] <ArgentUndaCova> I guess Dragon Priests in Skyrim are cool
[3:45:00] <it_came_from_outer_space> Most are fine but I just dont like when big impactful like story bosses are reused @PatStaresAt
[3:45:01] <+twdlrr> I feel like they probably could've spaced out some of those Ulcerated Tree Spirits at least
[3:45:04] <%Felhad> @rubberfistfight you keep replying to yourself...
[3:45:06] <blue8moon> and a lot of the reuse is in this game's version of chalice dungeons, which is the perfect place for it
[3:45:09] <%Valdorick> ... But you were correct... it is Astel.
[3:45:12] <%EldritchBee> I see it like "Aw hell yeah I get to fight this guy again"
[3:45:14] <it_came_from_outer_space> @PatStaresAt like when you fought godrick 2.0 that wass real lame imo
[3:45:16] <leole11> they should just make a 200 hour game with 100% unique content throughout
[3:45:16] <Sol_Install> The problem is people bloody don't understand reusing assest is normal
[3:45:18] <%Valdorick> HE CAME IN!?
[3:45:20] <%notsoy> gg
[3:45:21] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> now that's unfair
[3:45:21] <+ReallyBigRocks> fuck
[3:45:25] <Namillus> Elden Ring has bosses, Bosses, and BOSSES
[3:45:25] <TwistParabola> F
[3:45:26] <%Cozy90> :O
[3:45:27] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> SNIPED
[3:45:28] <%EldritchBee> LMAO
[3:45:28] <KyberNasse> Its the Nerds Rope Demon
[3:45:28] <BigBruthaThunda> he shouldnt lol
[3:45:31] <+Tredecian> He came in before the fog gate appreared
[3:45:31] <NewWillinium> Huh.  NEVER saw him come in before. That's wild
[3:45:31] <TheSandmanIsHere> welcome to the meme beam
[3:45:32] <%greasypete00> so is astel not a name
[3:45:32] <%Freakin_Wolfy> To the guy who grew up with Bulldogs, did they tear apart every toy you gave them? Every toy we give ours she IMMEDIATELY tears it apart like it's her fucking job
[3:45:33] <ohno58> how'd he get in there?
[3:45:33] <Omenaire_> that thing is awesome
[3:45:33] <Saturation_Lizard> he clipped through before the fog wall materialized
[3:45:36] <%G_476> the fog door formed late, I guess
[3:45:36] <%sniffy77> thats a tad bs
[3:45:37] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> So no Coward. Kill that man lol
[3:45:38] <%TheGreatSkenardo> alabaster lord doesn't give a FUCK
[3:45:38] <+Ragnakawaii> That man took that hit like it was nouthing
[3:45:38] <ebrion> He was most way through the door befor the wall came up
[3:45:39] <+ReallyBigRocks> why don't they just hire more artists Kappa
[3:45:41] <eleskei> just make the bosses sexier and or cuter then ppl wont mind reuse so much
[3:45:42] <Augus7717> bugged his way in LUL
[3:45:43] <joodatious> @Namillus this is true
[3:45:44] <sephyrs> its an old glitch LUL
[3:45:46] <%twohitgood> he got in front of you during the animation so i guess he got in before the wall spawned.
[3:45:46] <Giztech> maybe cause fog door wasn't there
[3:45:57] <leole11> dark souls 1 is like 30 hours long
[3:45:59] <BigBruthaThunda> i do
[3:46:05] <ohno58> They do
[3:46:07] <rosabellamelantha> DRAGON ASSES
[3:46:09] <%Puhff> Wow yeah wtf
[3:46:09] <%strakillias> You buggged that dude in. He was touching you as the door opened then the wall went up behind the two of you.
[3:46:12] <Omenaire_> yea they have the same movement patterns
[3:46:16] <Omenaire_> LUL
[3:46:17] <%greasypete00> and theyre asll doing the same idle anims
[3:46:22] <joodatious> that was because DS1 had UNFINISHED areas
[3:46:26] <%twohitgood> yeah, the dragon butts are just all in a giant row. it's actual copy paste. not just asset reuse.
[3:46:30] <Doordox> what the hell is this boss omg
[3:46:30] <doster504> people till do tho triple asylum demon isn't just something people don't talk about lol
[3:46:31] <%Valdorick> @Sol_Install The most frustrating complaint I hear is "They reused the backstab animation, how lazy!" Like, fucker, you don't make a new animation set EVERY GAME. If you have an attack animation for your skeleton, you reuse it!
[3:46:36] <Doordox> it looks so cooooool
[3:46:37] <senfood> How many Astels did those huge nerds make, good lord.
[3:46:39] <heartlesshealer> enjoy this dragonfly man
[3:46:40] <%Monkeyweed21> you can literally see the ctrl c ctrl v placing of the dragon asses
[3:46:47] <SomeAsianDood> LUL
[3:46:47] <NewHamwall> Based
[3:46:48] <+Panic_at_the_Discord> atpLaw atpWind
[3:46:49] <SomeAsianDood> gottem
[3:46:53] <%notsoy> lmao get fucked
[3:46:53] <%greasypete00> rip
[3:46:54] <some_brave_apollo> i do think the 20 near identical variations of asylum demon in this game is pretty egregious
[3:46:54] <+orochiblood> Lol
[3:46:56] <+Tunnelcakesrule> based on how quickly and how much game we got, im glad they copy pasted stuff from ds3
[3:46:58] <+Fetrigon> OMEGALUL
[3:46:58] <heartlesshealer> Baby grandpa appear <3
[3:46:59] <casualbaloth> decimated
[3:47:01] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> BUT MY STRAWMAN
[3:47:02] <%notsoy> also asset reuse rules, look at RGG
[3:47:03] <%TheGreatSkenardo> The fist fight got a bit less rubbery
[3:47:03] <TwistParabola> rip
[3:47:03] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> dont taunt chat
[3:47:05] <+orochiblood> People get so heated over Elden Ring, its so funny
[3:47:05] <%SveriSageAdvice> annihilated
[3:47:05] <%abakkus> this game is so huge that i would be straight up worried for the devs if every single mobset in every single zone and every single supersecret boss was a unique model with a unique moveset. thats so much work.
[3:47:05] <joodatious> man that tail attack wiffs so often its hilarious if you're just running to it
[3:47:06] <%Felhad> RIP Rubber
[3:47:06] <digaogrunge> lul
[3:47:10] <DestroPrime83> Get Hammered Bro
[3:47:11] <bassoontyphoon> Dear god ty Pat
[3:47:13] <+Ragnakawaii> Friendship with Oleg ended, now Mimic Tear is my best friend
[3:47:14] <some_brave_apollo> but fighting most bosses twice is actually a positive I think
[3:47:16] <MidnightPacif1c> i like how this thing is being contained by wood
[3:47:18] <ohno58> Kinda expected reusing stuff in an open world game.
[3:47:19] <churropoppa> imagine going to a twitch chat to argue
[3:47:21] <%Pookiedaexzile> Boss reuse what is this a Video game
[3:47:22] <+ScrapKingKeita> to be fair, some of the reused bosses here are ass, like the Triple  Putrid Crystalian fight
[3:47:24] <leole11> why'd you jump down lmao
[3:47:24] <DramaticTension> He's also @ ing you evry time
[3:47:25] <fatsausagedoggo> F
[3:47:27] <%Puhff> LMAO
[3:47:27] <+RedMaskBandit> there's a second version of this boss??
[3:47:28] <Omenaire_> what was even the argument LUL
[3:47:31] <%JoshManVGH> It's from the same school of thought as "Oh no Kratos pushed the boat the same way!"
[3:47:32] <%notsoy> because shut up, that's how
[3:47:36] <NewHamwall> He's just polite
[3:47:37] <%MrMegaJackpots> he chooses to be there
[3:47:38] <Oxybe> if's allergic
[3:47:38] <joodatious> ELDEN WOOD
[3:47:38] <senfood> That's a GOOD POINT
[3:47:38] <%pinkslimegoblin> he's an introvert
[3:47:39] <%Freakin_Wolfy> Can we talk about boss reuse of gargoyles? Because the only correct amount of gargoyles is 0
[3:47:39] <+Casavilla458> hello everyone I'm new one thing they did in DS1 the first demon was used three times fire version and the other two versions in the beginning
[3:47:40] <Saturation_Lizard> i think he's comfy down there
[3:47:41] <%AHomeschoolDropout> ! ENEMY FELLED ¡
[3:47:41] <ebrion> Bugs get slow in the cold maybe, lol
[3:47:42] <%Puhff> Git owned
[3:47:43] <Namillus> It's being contained by the golden fog
[3:47:43] <+RedMaskBandit> I'm just tired of you saying his weird name.
[3:47:45] <TheSandmanIsHere> the same way the original Green Lantern was
[3:47:46] <%Cozy90> little fences are the toughest force fields
[3:47:46] <$bcdenton> trapped by its own cake
[3:47:48] <%geekjacob> it dosent want too get a splinter
[3:47:49] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> it took one look outside and noped back in the cave
[3:47:50] <joodatious> he likes it in there lmao
[3:47:51] <%greasypete00> he has no reason to leave
[3:47:53] <Augus7717> maybe it just really likes its cave
[3:47:54] <%mythcreant> @JoshManVGH was just gonna say this
[3:47:56] <moneymoves2030> I have never gave a spider monkey a reach around while reciting the pledge of allegiance
[3:47:58] <+deathbyace> OR THIRD VERSION OF THIS DUDE? FUCK
[3:47:58] <%Monkeyweed21> @ScrapKingKeita yea but thats bad cuz of overtuning rather than because you fight too many Crystallians over the game
[3:47:59] <Namillus> Just because you can't see the golden fog until the fight starts doesn't mean it isn't there
[3:48:00] <XxMoliciousxX> it's not being contained, he lives there!
[3:48:00] <%Felhad> @dramatictension Thats not true, he often @s himself
[3:48:04] <%notsoy> how long did you time him out, i hope it was 8 weeks
[3:48:09] <+anoldtoilet> lol
[3:48:09] <Augus7717> LUL
[3:48:10] <%BinaryFireball> hey did you guys know that they refuse bosses sometimes?
[3:48:10] <ape_hawk> how about i reuse the same kicking animation of my foot up their asses?!?
[3:48:10] <@Spydurman> who would win? An Eldritch abomination from beyond the space or one wooden splinter
[3:48:12] <+muetank> it's not trying to get out. its trying to keep YOU out
[3:48:13] <knotsundownsyndrome> you know how it is with splinters
[3:48:13] <leole11> @Freakin_Wolfy i like the gargoyles, but yes, you have to play sooo passively, waiting for them to finish their moveset to get maybe 1 hit in
[3:48:17] <%Valdorick> Yeah, that's the front door to his HOUSE
[3:48:19] <%Puhff> That dude loves to argue just to do it
[3:48:20] <sundizzle> wait pat why do you run that way every time, you unlocked a shortcut
[3:48:21] <%Dakuu75> Hey, getting a splinter under your finger nail... that shit changes a man.
[3:48:22] <+anoldtoilet> oh uh
[3:48:24] <NewWillinium> Hey Chat, what would you suggest for starting a Faith build? Prophet, Confessor, or Bandit?
[3:48:25] <+anoldtoilet> hi
[3:48:30] <domukujira> astel just really likes caves
[3:48:31] <+Nomenanza> wait wouldnt it be easier for you to go through that door you opened that leads straight from grace?
[3:48:34] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> mimic chan is stuck
[3:48:35] <Aussie_Manny> WHAT IN THE FUCK IS THAT THING??! WutFace
[3:48:37] <+BloodyBurney> i do wonder how astel is around after we killed him, but there's some weird stuff going on with the metaphsics of this world
[3:48:38] <+anoldtoilet> this is certainly something huh
[3:48:41] <%BinaryFireball> astel is such a shitter, so cool and so much bullshit
[3:48:41] <%JoshManVGH> "It's a new game, damn it, he should push the boat a NEW way!"
[3:48:42] <+glybirdy> This boss is disturbing looking
[3:48:45] <+ReallyBigRocks> mans got wiggly bones
[3:48:45] <oedocontroller> oh, pat doin my fav boss as of late, next to mimic tear
[3:48:50] <Omenaire_> LOOK AT THIS FUCKER
[3:48:50] <rosabellamelantha> tbh I wouldn't really care if it was another boss so I think it's just my bias cus Astel is REALLY cool and him being here makes like 0 sense but I acknowledge a bunch of other bosses wouldn't make sense either
[3:48:51] <ebrion> Big cosmis eye in the skull
[3:48:55] <%Valdorick> Breath vape at this fucker
[3:48:56] <%Zundelle> @NewWillinium I like confessor because the armor is real flowy and nice
[3:48:58] <%Willowight> theres no way it could fit through that door, open
[3:49:00] <%Dakuu75> Getting some Dark Beast Paarl vibes here... io'm getting hitbox PTSD
[3:49:01] <Namillus> People can't die right in a different way to in Dark Souls
[3:49:02] <%radiorosewater> @NewWillinium confesssor if you want good melee off the bat, they have a 100 phys reduction shield
[3:49:02] <joodatious> probably confessor honestly but starting classes aren't a huge deal tbh
[3:49:02] <+orochiblood> Has anyone seen people getting xenophobic about this game, its kinda messed up
[3:49:04] <%mythcreant> love this space dragonfly guy
[3:49:04] <DerpioParty> Covid dragon
[3:49:05] <+AyupaPupa> space bug catches the common cold

[3:49:13] <AlphaRayAllen> Covid breath
[3:49:16] <Oxybe> Throw rocks at bug pat! remember the pokemon matchups!
[3:49:17] <Omenaire_> HOLY SHIT
[3:49:17] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> one downside of mimic is they can get command grabbed
[3:49:19] <Morsuzado> as someone who doesn't play the games a lot but seen Elden ring everywhere, I do recognize bosses lifted from other games. I figured it was for people who wanted to be able to redo those fights.
[3:49:19] <%Valdorick> Vored
[3:49:20] <+Captain_sevatar> nom
[3:49:21] <XxMoliciousxX> ever read "color out of space"? yeah that
[3:49:22] <+Tredecian> nomed
[3:49:24] <%Deft_Thought> That's some bullllshit
[3:49:24] <%BinaryFireball> @orochiblood  I don't even want the know

[3:49:28] <Omenaire_> COSMIC FLYING ANT???
[3:49:28] <%mythcreant> this astel guy is real mad
[3:49:29] <%Dakuu75> oof... can't mash outa that one, eh.
[3:49:29] <Zarokaz> what do these bosses do in their spare time, Astel could probably run a pretty mean knitting circle
[3:49:29] <MidnightPacif1c> NomNom NomNom
[3:49:29] <+TVs_Rob_and_Friends> pwnvicerated
[3:49:30] <%Felhad> Vore
[3:49:30] <@DakotaMacDoodle> This is such a cool boss
[3:49:30] <%MrMegaJackpots> never saw that
[3:49:31] <sundizzle> @patstaresat you unlocked a shortcut door btw, don't know if you realized
[3:49:31] <oedocontroller> you probably shouldn't scarlet rot a boss that lives next to a lake of rot xD
[3:49:31] <TwistParabola> vored
[3:49:32] <Strigiform> watching mimic get grabbed and like wow looks like that hurt
[3:49:34] <%soloshotfirst82> Looking at all these enormous caverns and buildings and the sewers and everything, I just wanna know ... who builds all this stuff and how long do you think it took?
[3:49:35] <x2Twistedx> is there multiple of this guy ?
[3:49:36] <rosabellamelantha> @orochiblood yeah it's a bunch of game devs on twitter getting REAL xenophobic because they hate the japanese it's bad
[3:49:38] <Aussie_Manny> Eww, tastes like salt.
[3:49:39] <+RedMaskBandit> ggez no re
[3:49:40] <leole11> i absolutely love AND hate that grab
[3:49:47] <riley_the_mudwing> That ambush grab is BS
[3:49:51] <Khester824> Just fought this Astel and Bleed Whips owned him
[3:49:52] <ohno58> feels like a jank monhun boss
[3:49:53] <+Fetrigon> THAT WAS COOL AS SHIT PogBones PogBones PogBones PogBones PogBones PogBones PogBones
[3:49:55] <+deathbyace> SPACE BUG SUCKSS
[3:49:55] <KyberNasse> Pat watch out for the grab
[3:49:58] <%BinaryFireball> wait are the devs xenophobic??? oh boy
[3:50:00] <+Captain_sevatar> its a fuckin cool boss tho
[3:50:00] <+orochiblood> People going full Disco Elysium Measurehead over this game
[3:50:02] <+BloodyBurney> astel stars of darkness feels like a kingdom hearts name
[3:50:10] <moneymoves2030> they're tagged don't worry about it
[3:50:12] <STORMWIZARD1> I thought u were a tough guy PAT LUL
[3:50:12] <AlphaRayAllen> xenojiva looking ass dude
[3:50:12] <%whyskeywolfe> Eh.
[3:50:15] <%twistedj3ster> the amount of bosses in this game that have 90% health grab moves is starting to frustrate me
[3:50:19] <rosabellamelantha> @BinaryFireball No not these devs it was horizon and ubisoft devs
[3:50:22] <oedocontroller> oh wait that's NOT the "tough one" xD
[3:50:24] <%MrMegaJackpots> LOOK AT THAT POSION
[3:50:29] <TheSandmanIsHere> @orochiblood did Pat play that? would be neat to see
[3:50:29] <oedocontroller> didn't know this game has 2 of those
[3:50:38] <%BinaryFireball> yea I was guessing it was them
[3:50:43] <+Captain_sevatar> rot breath mvp
[3:50:44] <+alphonseisbest> is this guy about as hard as the last one? @patstaresat
[3:50:45] <%greasypete00> what the fuck
[3:50:46] <+anoldtoilet> OH HE HATES THE ROT
[3:50:46] <%Dakuu75> What if the Elden ring is just the entrance to an Ant-Hill and these are cosmic ants?
[3:50:49] <Aussie_Manny> Stinky breath!
[3:50:49] <%Valdorick> Welcome to Meteor town, YOU NEVER SAW THIS MOVE
[3:50:55] <joodatious> its always funny when a none nintendo Japanese game is popular you end up seeing some real assholes getting salty
[3:50:56] <%shootbang_exe> wait is it actual xenophobia or is it just bad takes because "best practices" have been beaten into them?
[3:50:57] <+kewlmyc> Is this the same boss from Ranni's quest?
[3:51:00] <Aussie_Manny> Oh GOD
[3:51:01] <%AHomeschoolDropout> Safest place for me when I fought him was, funnily enough, right in front, as he tended to not do his crazy-ass AOE
[3:51:06] <%Deft_Thought> Ranni wants to go to space where these fuckers live?
[3:51:12] <%BinaryFireball> honestly I'm surprised I didn't run into a giant ant boss
[3:51:12] <+deathbyace> dragon spells fucking rn
[3:51:15] <some_brave_apollo> cyclops is cool
[3:51:19] <%greasypete00> @Dakuu75 there are actual giant ants in this game
[3:51:20] <%nip_nips> @kewlmyc yeah its a second one
[3:51:21] <Aussie_Manny> OPTIC BLAST
[3:51:24] <+anoldtoilet> @shootbang_exe its hardcore racism disguised as best practices
[3:51:27] <+Nomenanza> it's VERY hard not to use bleed/rot in this game
[3:51:28] <%Freakin_Wolfy> @Dakuu75 that's some lovecraftian level shit that I'm not prepared to deal with on a Thursday night
[3:51:29] <sirrice77> @kewlmyc almost entirely the same yeah
[3:51:39] <DestroPrime83> WTF happned to its health
[3:51:41] <Aussie_Manny> Max?!
[3:51:48] <+croutonian> he healed???
[3:51:48] <+Captain_sevatar> makes you feel like a crazy ass cyclops too
[3:51:49] <+anoldtoilet> every one of those people three tweets down is like "actually its jkust the japanese traits, they have a bone in their leg that makes them make bad games"
[3:51:50] <DestroPrime83> it just started to melt away
[3:51:51] <AlphaRayAllen> BEHOLD
[3:51:52] <Aussie_Manny> Doesn't look like it.
[3:51:54] <rosabellamelantha> @Deft_Thought I mean have you seen the ocean? people still love that
[3:51:55] <+ReallyBigRocks> cool
[3:51:56] <artoflec> thats still from REALLY far away yeah
[3:51:56] <Saturation_Lizard> you dodge ANOTHER boss' BS attacks
[3:51:57] <TwistParabola> gg
[3:51:58] <Aussie_Manny> Ah well. GG.
[3:51:58] <+Huderga> "max range" lmao
[3:51:58] <+Teilwal> good job Cyclops
[3:51:59] <%Felhad> @patstaresat When you get to your INT playthrough you should try out the Wing of Astel curved sword, it's super fun
[3:51:59] <%twistedj3ster> Crazy Talk is a bastard
[3:52:00] <%radiorosewater> YO
[3:52:01] <%furiousfurioso> this spell is super good against big bitches with the infinite FP physick
[3:52:03] <joodatious> amazing
[3:52:05] <sendart> Tiche happened
[3:52:08] <%VeryBestPlot> and wife still rocks
[3:52:13] <Aussie_Manny> Pretty far, yeah.
[3:52:15] <%greasypete00> frenzied burst is also prety alright in pvp if people dont know what it is
[3:52:15] <sundizzle> that boss somehow healed itself, is that the bug someone was talking about earlier?
[3:52:16] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> does that got a cool lore?
[3:52:23] <Omenaire_> wheres the heartpiece ?
[3:52:24] <joodatious> thank you wife
[3:52:25] <Noshi1234> by the door
[3:52:25] <%shootbang_exe> @anoldtoilet that's dumb as hell
[3:52:26] <%geekjacob> oh no he got a splinter and died
[3:52:28] <DestroPrime83> THat thing looks like its the final boss to Darkest Dungeon
[3:52:28] <%Willowight> did it drop anything
[3:52:28] <+Captain_sevatar> run straight through
[3:52:29] <Morsuzado> a big man, just like Cyclops
[3:52:30] <+stellarseeker> @PatStaresAt Wait, did you try out that new madness spell?
[3:52:30] <%TheGreatSkenardo> got to be a hidden wall
[3:52:31] <+dudlerand> yeah it's the best snipe spell
[3:52:33] <rosabellamelantha> @sundizzle yes
[3:52:34] <Aussie_Manny> I did it!!
[3:52:36] <+Ragnakawaii> Those boss's gravity well move is so cool
[3:52:37] <TwistParabola> there should be a thing out
[3:52:39] <doster504> @sundizzle Pat's summon puts a max health debuff on the boss and it wore off
[3:52:39] <+ReallyBigRocks> can you fast travel out?
[3:52:40] <Saturation_Lizard> that version of astel has a move where he summons clones of himself in a circle all around the arena that do the teleport grab at the same time
[3:52:40] <joodatious> that spell IS COOL
[3:52:46] <%Dakuu75> These are some Sephiroth-ass Sephiroth magics
[3:52:46] <%JoshManVGH> Which one?
[3:52:47] <+ReallyBigRocks> neat
[3:52:51] <Aussie_Manny> SE PHI ROTH
[3:52:53] <%Willowight> ohh like a meteor shower
[3:52:53] <%nip_nips> ew, licking PATS feet?
[3:52:54] <sundizzle> doster504 oh no shit, I didn't know that worked on bosses
[3:52:58] <bassoontyphoon> Man what a dick
[3:52:59] <%twistedj3ster> he snort
[3:52:59] <leole11> @Saturation_Lizard that move is so good, sad that pat didn't get to see it
[3:53:03] <joodatious> literally meteor shower on dudes
[3:53:03] <%Valdorick> So... is there more than one Astel, or is he bound space and time and in multiple places at once?
[3:53:03] <Aussie_Manny> DA BABY
[3:53:04] <oedocontroller> what helmet is that?
[3:53:04] <%radiorosewater> so nokron was leveled by that thing?
[3:53:05] <KatabolicRage> that caravan from earliar has something else to get from it at night
[3:53:06] <DestroPrime83> BEHOLD! THE INFINITE MALIGNITY OF THE STARS!
[3:53:06] <+ReallyBigRocks> oh no
[3:53:07] <heartlesshealer> <3
[3:53:08] <Oxybe> DOG STREAM!DOG STREAM!DOG STREAM!
[3:53:12] <%Valdorick> Beyong*
[3:53:13] <sirrice77> @sundizzle no so he used the summon Tiche, and tiche has a move the temporarily reduces the bosses hp. When it wears off the bosses health "heals"
[3:53:14] <%Felhad> I think you can port out of any dungeon after you kill the boss
[3:53:14] <moneymoves2030> lil tiny feets
[3:53:15] <%Valdorick> BEYOND*
[3:53:15] <doster504> @sundizzle it's pretty nutty
[3:53:16] <%radiorosewater> is that a dog?
[3:53:20] <%BlackStarAura> psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp
[3:53:21] <%shootbang_exe> so is astel a name or a type of creature?
[3:53:23] <%radiorosewater> fuuny dog
[3:53:24] <sundizzle> sirrice77 yeah, I just realized
[3:53:24] <%Kurgash> His other 100k are just gone now? He left them behind?
[3:53:26] <+Casavilla458> GG
[3:53:27] <joodatious> gravity magic is so fun in this game i love it
[3:53:29] <+BloodyBurney> no its a turtle
[3:53:31] <nevan_44> snort
[3:53:35] <some_brave_apollo> the "lore" behind multiple versions of the same boss is pretty hard to justify, but that should never get in the way of gameplay anyway
[3:53:35] <%Niney_Who> that shit is wild
[3:53:38] <Aussie_Manny> I love Zangief, he seems so nonplussed all the time
[3:53:40] <%Monkeyweed21> Y'know if Astels and other naturalborns are just common place in space I dont know about Rannis plan
[3:53:42] <roguemephilesclone> Dude, the Sephiroth builds you could make in this game...
[3:53:43] <dds333a> the fuck was that LUL
[3:53:44] <leole11> that's pretty cool :)
[3:53:47] <%Dakuu75> Pat, literally using a crazy-talk build now
[3:53:48] <ExpressNode> That gauge go up
[3:53:53] <%radiorosewater> @BloodyBurney explains the carapace!
[3:53:55] <+Casavilla458> this game reminds me a lot of DS3 convergence mod
[3:53:56] <oedocontroller> @shootbang_exe no it's a character/boss/individual. It's just appears twice, similar to regal spirit
[3:53:58] <%MrMegaJackpots> what a good dancer
[3:54:01] <bassoontyphoon> Hey Pat! As someone who doesn’t have a huge amount of free time to game, do you think Elden Ring would be a waste of money for me because of the time commitment to beat it?
[3:54:03] <TheSandmanIsHere> Inescapable frenzy is a meme for pvp
[3:54:04] <%strakillias> Reminder: Night Caravan
[3:54:05] <TwistParabola> BABY
[3:54:06] <+BubbaRands> look he blep
[3:54:08] <+anoldtoilet> @shootbang_exe i think technically every one of the stars in the sky is supposed to be one of him
[3:54:09] <%Dakuu75> Gief: No fucks given~
[3:54:11] <joodatious> I'm making an Armstrong build rn and its fun as hell
[3:54:11] <%Willowight> is that max duration?
[3:54:12] <%WhereIsWill> WhereIsWill is gifting 5 Tier 1 Subs to PatStaresAt's community! They've gifted a total of 5 in the channel!

[3:54:14] <TheSandmanIsHere> insta-kill if you get the grab
[3:54:14] <NewWillinium> I like how people added GODEFREY to the God Family tree. When I think it's literally just a mispelling
[3:54:18] <%AyveeVA> AyveeVA subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months! 
[3:54:20] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt those ruins you were at earlier have a cool secret next to them in the trees
[3:54:22] <+dudlerand> we do we all talk to our pets this way?
[3:54:23] <DestroPrime83> How can that dog possibly be that fat, dumb, and smelly?
[3:54:23] <+Soul_Force> what a cutie
[3:54:25] <AlphaRayAllen> ayy
[3:54:30] <%twistedj3ster> I'm so bummed they put the blood katana so far into the game
[3:54:36] <joodatious> @NewWillinium its amazing
[3:54:45] <%geekjacob> psaGiefstare
[3:54:51] <roguemephilesclone> Isn't Godefrey an actual boss, though? And he LOOKS like Godrick?
[3:54:53] <mikesapartment> csbeastScared
[3:55:11] <%Dakuu75> (can't imagine how many night-bosses I've missed)
[3:55:13] <oedocontroller> @roguemephilesclone no but he is a boss

[3:55:39] <%Monkeyweed21> @shootbang_exe When stars fall in ER they adapt to the environment around them, if they land near people they turn into alabaster lords, if they land near rocky areas or mining outcrops they become falling star beasts and if they land near an eternal city they turn into a "naturalborn" like Astel

[3:57:45] <%pinkslimegoblin> cosmos eating bug< 3 dogs
[3:57:46] <+ReallyBigRocks> Pat you're not overleveled enough
[3:57:46] <Ekaelis> A man who kills demigods for a living, dies to a pack of mangy dogs.
[3:57:48] <roguemephilesclone> This game was more designed to be broken than even we know.
[3:57:48] <moneymoves2030> That's what you get for not saving the dog at the beginning
[3:57:49] <rekinom> Tarnished can kill a dead god from beyond the stars but gets vibe checked by two dogs
[3:57:52] <%Felhad> @roguemephilesclone The entire last 25% of the game is like this
[3:57:54] <blue8moon> dogs man
[3:57:58] <athuramn> these dogs aint barkin around
[3:57:58] <Aussie_Manny> Is this all snow or salt?
[3:58:02] <moneymoves2030> no you have to start all over
[3:58:02] <sundizzle> the caravan was south of the river
[3:58:04] <%Valdorick> The Tarnished "I killed a literal god child from the stars themselves, who laid low an ancient, powerful, eternal city. Also the Tarnished "Oh no, dogs, oof, ouch, owie"
[3:58:07] <oedocontroller> i like how dying to low-level enemies in souls games is not considered being bad at games xD
[3:58:21] <%Dakuu75> did Pat ever do anything with Dung Eater? I still dunno wtf that guy's deal is
[3:58:21] <%TheGreatSkenardo> fuck them off yourself, coward!
[3:58:27] <moneymoves2030> Your right hand comes off
[3:58:29] <+imthinkingdarbys> it's being chased
[3:58:29] <zanzibarian_hamster> Yeah why don't we just get a pile of rats to throw at bosses? Those little bastards are stupid powerful
[3:58:29] <+ReallyBigRocks> it just wants to live Pat
[3:58:40] <joodatious> these games sure know how to humble you
[3:58:40] <%AyveeVA> Check the caravan, it has some sick loot
[3:58:40] <phoenix_games87> I use night shade to kill those things lol
[3:58:41] <Oxybe> Giant galaxy scorpion dragonfly demon? easy. 4 doggos? hardmode.
[3:58:43] <Aussie_Manny> I hope Zangief isn't troubled by this.
[3:58:44] <oedocontroller> it's dark souls dogs, pat. Being an asshole is kinda their thing
[3:58:45] <ArgentUndaCova> Damn, I completely missed this Ash mopO
[3:58:46] <%Felhad> @dakuu75 You probably do, he is not deep
[3:58:49] <blue8moon> well there is a summon that's a pack of rats

[3:58:54] <%Valdorick> @zanzibarian_hamster You can.
[3:58:58] <joodatious> yeah you can fight demigods but your never too strong not to get beaten up by some dogs
[3:58:59] <mantyz> is the same caravan
[3:58:59] <%tetraes> at night
[3:59:03] <KatabolicRage> southeast of you I think
[3:59:08] <+ReallyBigRocks> right over there 👉
[3:59:13] <sirrice77> @Dakuu75 Pat killed him. Dung eaters deal is he was a mixed race of human and something else and both races rejected and scorned him. So he hated the world
[3:59:16] <%Dakuu75> @Felhad Not deep, eh. ok, cool.
[3:59:18] <%greasypete00> red flowers monkaS
[3:59:18] <oedocontroller> what helmet is that, pat?

[4:00:08] <+anoldtoilet> yueah he wants revenge for being locked in a basement and forced to eat poop
[4:00:11] <+anoldtoilet> or something
[4:00:15] <%dcentii> oh dam is that nerijus
[4:00:18] <+anoldtoilet> no the blood lord is different actually lol
[4:00:20] <%Valdorick> Wow, the AI does not know how to handle jump attacks, huh?
[4:00:33] <joodatious> love how this kind of dude was just a npc fight at the start of the game, such a nice way to tease late game stuff
[4:00:33] <leole11> i wonder if pat is going to go fight BOSS or OTHER BOSS tonight
[4:00:34] <+swesterly> @anoldtoilet i'm almost positive he likes eating poop
[4:00:36] <+ReallyBigRocks> @anoldtoilet hes a synonym

[4:01:17] <joodatious> have you see the poop man again @PatStaresAt
[4:01:20] <ExpressNode> He beat your ass so hard it was like a drum solo
[4:01:23] <%radiorosewater> watch out for the knife
[4:01:25] <GhostPyre> what was that about the AI being bad at handling jump attacks?
[4:01:26] <KyberNasse> for no reason
[4:01:38] <+orochiblood> how come when i throw blood at people, I get kicked out of the hospital

[4:02:23] <GhostPyre> the jump attack has massive startup lag. It is one of the riskiest basic attacks in the game
[4:02:24] <%Felhad> @dakuu75 its a tree

[4:02:35] <%AyveeVA> There's a field boss at the cliff side

[4:05:14] <%JustToWatch> Pat look out, he has 2 Reduvias
[4:05:14] <ape_hawk> "now ill show you the power, of TWO reduvias!"
[4:05:18] <Paperware> @ArgentUndaCova Happened to me too, but I managed to get the bear to hug the invader to death
[4:05:21] <Baeltyr> yes
[4:05:21] <%Dakuu75> that'd be rad

[4:05:47] <%radiorosewater> psaElmo
[4:05:59] <%AHomeschoolDropout> Ofnir
[4:05:59] <%Valdorick> Maybe he's DLC man?
[4:06:02] <ape_hawk> someone who really hates shiteater
[4:06:02] <ArgentUndaCova> @Paperware Oh yeah, I just kept kiting the invader myself and he kept getting hit by friendly fire from the bear, but shit was still rough
[4:06:03] <oedocontroller> it's GGRM

[4:06:07] <TwistParabola> random dude
[4:06:08] <joodatious> its not
[4:06:13] <some_brave_apollo> is it not the same guy who introduced Radahn?
[4:06:13] <+ATorL> that is not ofnir
[4:06:15] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> I like invading players to act as a vergil boss fight, making sure my weapon cant oneshot
[4:06:15] <Baeltyr> is it the blacksmith god or something?
[4:06:17] <+alphonseisbest> no
[4:06:18] <Aussie_Manny> Only WHO can prevent forest fires? [You] You pressed you, referring to me, that is incorrect. The correct answer is you. 🐻
[4:06:19] <%Valdorick> Its not Ofnir, its just some dude who isn't in game.
[4:06:20] <joodatious> I love Shabriri
[4:06:23] <%Puhff> Steve Jobs
[4:06:23] <+imthinkingdarbys> @Freakin_Wolfy there's a crossbow that is Gut's hand crossbow

[4:06:28] <%Felhad> Just a guy
[4:06:33] <%Dakuu75> @Freakin_Wolfy I think your best bet is to use a short bow (maybe crossbow) with the multi-fire ash move
[4:06:34] <%EldritchBee> It's deffo not Ofnir, I think it's just Shabriri
[4:06:34] <nevan_44> me :)

[4:14:38] <$SGrim> Lobo is jut st wolf in spanish
[4:14:38] <SomeAsianDood> it's loretta's sister (not literally)
[4:14:38] <%TheGreatSkenardo> my mans named her wolf "wolf"
[4:14:41] <%strakillias> She named her wolf wolf
[4:14:41] <oedocontroller> that's not the quest's end
[4:14:43] <sirrice77> @Baeltyr what're you confused about
[4:14:44] <+RedMaskBandit> that albernaruic chick with the wolf
[4:14:44] <$SGrim> Lobo is just wolf in spanish
[4:14:47] <%greasypete00> lay her to rest beside the main man
[4:14:49] <%Valdorick> @TheSandmanIsHere He did
[4:14:52] <%radiorosewater> @TheSandmanIsHere ye
[4:14:53] <+rbakervv> @TheSandmanIsHere yeah he did that already
[4:14:54] <sjcodan> What?
[4:14:59] <%MaybeFalco> OH ITS NOT?
[4:15:00] <oedocontroller> pat, 90% of quests in this game end with a boss
[4:15:01] <%SveriSageAdvice> *what do you mean the quest doesnt end there*
[4:15:04] <TwistParabola> ?
[4:15:04] <%JonathLP> Yeah, let her rest in peace dude
[4:15:05] <+RedMaskBandit> best boi
[4:15:06] <MartyFun11> Are Albinaurics related to mimic tears?

[4:15:12] <XxMoliciousxX> no lobos is a dark souls streamer
[4:15:13] <%baka_sugoi> KOKOMI JELLYFISH PogChamp HungryPaimon
[4:15:19] <%EldritchBee> @Baeltyr The Albinaurics are an artificial people created to be servants for Raya Lucaria, they believed the Haligtree would be a place where they could be free, so they all tried to journey there
[4:15:21] <%JonathLP> She said, "I'll be at your side, UNTIL YOU LAY ME TO REST"
[4:15:27] <klooswep> So if someone gets a lobotomy, does that mean they got their wolf removed? Kappa
[4:15:31] <jubejube56> That quest ends there far as I know, somebody made a video about the "quest" with extra stuff that doesn't do anything
[4:15:33] <%EldritchBee> Go to Wolfie
[4:15:33] <%Felhad> @bakademic nah. he helped her sister impregnate her
[4:15:34] <sjcodan> Go back to wolf?
[4:15:36] <oedocontroller> you gotta fight a boss
[4:15:38] <leole11> albinaurics = homonculus
[4:15:43] <bakademic> cool
[4:15:44] <%EldritchBee> Lower
[4:15:45] <%SveriSageAdvice> no
[4:15:48] <%EldritchBee> South-er more
[4:15:49] <%SveriSageAdvice> further down
[4:15:49] <%Dakuu75> now wait for something to be born then eat its umbilicle cord... in true bloodborne fashion
[4:15:53] <%SveriSageAdvice> to the right
[4:15:57] <oda_flobunaga> Right
[4:16:21] <Baeltyr> ?
[4:16:22] <$bcdenton> That was the end of the quest, idk what folks mean
[4:16:22] <%Valdorick> Did you just get... 1 guy'd?
[4:16:24] <Baeltyr> its dead?
[4:16:27] <%Felhad> to the LEEEEFT
[4:16:35] <heartlesshealer> slumbering
[4:16:35] <sjcodan> I'll be real with you champ, I'd have done that too
[4:16:42] <%EldritchBee> There COULD BE more, there's so much unknown shit rn
[4:16:42] <%G_476> It was always dead, that's why she became ashes
[4:16:44] <%Valdorick> Yeah, you got a Dragonstone, that seems like end of quest.
[4:16:46] <rosabellamelantha> 1 guy?
[4:16:47] <%SveriSageAdvice> for real is there more to the quest or what
[4:16:49] <sjcodan> I MEAN IT MADE SENSE
[4:16:49] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> psa1guy
[4:16:57] <%EldritchBee> Nobody knows how to complete Nepheli's questline
[4:17:01] <$bcdenton> no, the quest is over
[4:17:04] <+silver__viii> you didn't get a big "quest complete" popup silly :)
[4:17:08] <%radiorosewater> i am confused
[4:17:09] <joodatious> quest guides are indeed unfinished and awful
[4:17:15] <sundizzle> i think you have to talk to ofnir after you complete the secret zone, maybe thats whey mean
[4:17:16] <sirrice77> @Baeltyr Gist of it is like the souls games. Just instead of you being chosen to link the flames instead there's a power vacuum and people are fighting/questing to be the one to fill it
[4:17:17] <%Dakuu75> I botched Volcano Manor because I beat the final boss too soon
[4:17:17] <%SveriSageAdvice> ok good because i was about to lose my mind and start looking
[4:17:23] <%Valdorick> @EldritchBee I'm convinced its bugged.
[4:17:26] <peachy996> Nice quests I can see why HZD devs are so jealouus
[4:17:46] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> @EldritchBee Or unfinished like a bunch of other quests
[4:17:51] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @Valdorick Someone e-mailed Bandai Support, and they said that they would be "looking into it."
[4:17:51] <TheSandmanIsHere> did you visit the Stargazer Ruins and solve the puzzle there?
[4:17:59] <Aussie_Manny> Bears sleep in-game? Cool.
[4:18:04] <sjcodan> THERES SO MANY NIGHT BOSSES
[4:18:04] <Baeltyr> @sirrice77 i meant more in a sense of what im meant to be doing at any particular point, the previous games were so much more linear, and im jsut lost as what to do
[4:18:11] <zenith0111> @dakuu75 Oh just revisit the boss room shes still their
[4:18:17] <%Valdorick> I'm a little shocked there's so many night bosses, and like... ONE daytime boss.
[4:18:22] <sjcodan> I mean you COULD
[4:18:23] <%Felhad> lolno
[4:18:24] <senfood> The Original Stargazer Ruins

[4:18:37] <%Monkeyweed21> maybe if you go 10 hours a night
[4:18:38] <$bcdenton> and pat, you ignored the teleporter in the village
[4:18:39] <Wakerz140> Two more streams minimum if you want to do at least most content
[4:18:43] <%Felhad> @patstaresat Haligtree is through the portal at Liturgical town
[4:18:43] <%Dakuu75> @zenith0111 my problem was I never finished all the letters/invades
[4:18:47] <bakademic> dank bud
[4:18:47] <ohno58> haligtree is wall to wall cancer
[4:18:48] <joodatious> @PatStaresAt you forgot to check out the seal you unlocked at the village
[4:18:48] <TheSandmanIsHere> reunited the jellyfish with her sister, nice

[4:19:10] <sirrice77> @Baeltyr Oh well you gotta go after the demigods to be able to become elden lord. That never changes, so a large part of the game is just trying to find them

[4:21:26] <%Felhad> What about Walking Trees
[4:21:27] <oedocontroller> this game has a real boner for trees, you should respect them a bit more
[4:21:28] <joodatious> case and point
[4:21:28] <Aussie_Manny> dumbiss
[4:21:29] <roguemephilesclone> Dumb-oid MrDestructoid
[4:21:30] <sirrice77> @Baeltyr i would say after raya go up the lift and do altus. then either caelid or the capital. After you do both then try the mountains where pat is now
[4:21:30] <peachy996> Nice dumbiss
[4:21:31] <+kahryez> Kudzu?

[4:21:36] <knotsundownsyndrome> you lost your rights
[4:21:37] <sjcodan> TREES ARE TALLER THAN PAT
[4:21:38] <%radiorosewater> manzanita trees bleed when you bonk them
[4:21:41] <%tetraes> yeah trees suck we should burn down the Amazon Rainforest PogChamp
[4:21:42] <%Valdorick> Pat - thoughts on grey goo eating all trees and replacing us with perfect, dry, robot bodies?
[4:21:45] <jubejube56> Bears are just Rocks that move a lot
[4:21:46] <sjcodan> PAT MALDING BECAUSE SHORTER THAN TREES
[4:21:48] <%dekkitout> Pat's clearly envious of trees' ability to easily overcome gravity
[4:21:51] <oda_flobunaga> Such word much wow
[4:21:51] <oedocontroller> everyone's taller than pat :3
[4:21:52] <%nip_nips> @sjcodan SO IS ALMOST EVERYTHING

[4:22:35] <leole11> DOMINATING
[4:22:35] <oda_flobunaga> Wow, Pt is REALLY Overleveled for this
[4:22:35] <+anoldtoilet> pat is hardcore conspiracy theorist "mountains are petrified mega trees"
[4:22:36] <sjcodan> mothHeh mothHeh mothHeh
[4:22:36] <%dekkitout> What daggers are those and where can you get them
[4:22:37] <athuramn> hey yo you're bleeding

[4:22:45] <%Pookiedaexzile> Stylin On em
[4:22:45] <MartyFun11> I don't know pat, I stunlocked him with jump attacks
[4:22:47] <satiresatyr> came back with a pot of mash potatoes what id miss?
[4:22:52] <XxMoliciousxX> double bleed dagger seems good
[4:22:52] <joodatious> I cant believe pat is so overleveled
[4:23:01] <+RedMaskBandit> back to back
[4:23:03] <+Tredecian> dog can kill you at every single level
[4:23:03] <%Felhad> You literally cant overlevel
[4:23:06] <fistynopunches> everything post capital is a dick
[4:23:07] <sjcodan> I beat the game at 150, there's no such thing as overleveling
[4:23:08] <NewWillinium> There is no such thing as Overleveled in Elden Ring
[4:23:10] <knotsundownsyndrome> big penis levle
[4:23:11] <blue8moon> I never care about over-leveling LUL
[4:23:12] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> how can you "overlevel" when there's no "set level"?
[4:23:13] <joodatious> post capital tells you that you better be fucking ready
[4:23:14] <Zebroneath> it's the realist
[4:23:15] <zenith0111> This is technically a "Secret Map" too
[4:23:15] <%Valdorick> Complaints about being over leveled is just malding from people who play the game bad Kappa
[4:23:16] <oedocontroller> did pat do Ranni's questline?
[4:23:16] <akitanito> I feel like the entire design is intended for you to keep leveling
[4:23:17] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> 2 if youre Pat
[4:23:20] <%Dakuu75> how much vigor does Pat have like, 50?
[4:23:21] <%Felhad> 99VIG still gets 2-3shot by lategame shit
[4:23:23] <Komayeda> Oh hey, did you just get to this area too?
[4:23:24] <%furiousfurioso> do you still  have that thing that makes you take more damage though
[4:23:25] <leole11> you should probably get HP pat
[4:23:28] <+niknikmcsneakerton> you can definitely overlevel
[4:23:28] <XxMoliciousxX> overleveled?? you're still world 1 map 1
[4:23:32] <%Agami23> i actually think the damage numbers are kinda silly in this game
[4:23:35] <%Sneaky_Catfish> @PatStaresAt Can I give a tip? Try the Hoarfrost Stomp Ash of War.
[4:23:35] <%BonewheelVanguard> @PatStaresAt This guy is a real Blood for the Blood God type
[4:23:36] <42nfl19> @PatStaresAt Main story/boss track wise I feel like you are strong. Anythign extra or side content you are under level.
[4:23:37] <@goose_attack_almanac> WELL. Found the sorcery that has the level 68 int requirement
[4:23:39] <DerpioParty> That dog has a real bad case of mange
[4:23:40] <+nial_evol> talking about this game's progress in terms of weeks LUL
[4:23:43] <klooswep> This game is *very* determined to kill you as often as possible. I admire its tenacity in that regard.
[4:23:45] <satiresatyr> me too i overlevel and its still can be hard to play
[4:23:47] <RyuuAoi> Did he beat the game!?
[4:23:50] <%Fenrisulfr_V> I'm pretty sure Fextralife's leveling chart is just a fat lie.
[4:23:53] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> lorax comin for you
[4:23:57] <+ChaosedStar> what do yall think that spell smells like?
[4:24:01] <%greasypete00> fuck him
[4:24:03] <sjcodan> WHATS THAT SMELL?
[4:24:03] <joodatious> @RyuuAoi no lmao
[4:24:03] <%Felhad> CHOPPED
[4:24:04] <42nfl19> JUST DONT BE FANCY
[4:24:05] <%Valdorick> Just Zug Zug
[4:24:06] <sjcodan> ITS BLOOOOOOOOD
[4:24:07] <Komayeda> heck yeah
[4:24:09] <Aussie_Manny> Gottem
[4:24:11] <joodatious> that set looks so nice
[4:24:14] <%dekkitout> And you got some dope threads
[4:24:15] <+BubbaRands> DAWN THE DRIP
[4:24:15] <%Valdorick> Never be fancy, just rushdown
[4:24:17] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt check out the cliffs near here
[4:24:17] <+Grayhammatter> not even a problem
[4:24:19] <Aussie_Manny> Sanguine set!
[4:24:20] <oedocontroller> so pat got the moonblade?
[4:24:21] <sirrice77> @Baeltyr caelid is like supposed to be after liurnia but also part of it is just endgame level. Caelid is just slightly harder than altus imo. But honestly nothing wrong with just trying either and seeing which is easier to tackle
[4:24:23] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> it looks pretty cool
[4:24:25] <Komayeda> Maybe I should try to overlevel next playthrough...
[4:24:27] <%dekkitout> WUS DAT SMEL
[4:24:28] <%Pookiedaexzile> Stylish
[4:24:30] <klooswep> It's a lot easier to murder people when your blood stays inside your body
[4:24:32] <bakademic> sick af
[4:24:33] <joodatious> yeah pat has moonblade
[4:24:37] <+Tredecian> somthing somthign rocks over there
[4:24:37] <%boggsz12> you gonna go fight mohg before haligtree?
[4:24:37] <%Niney_Who> Check the hood out tho
[4:24:39] <bakademic> its blud
[4:24:40] <+ScrapKingKeita> Has Pat met the Lord of Blood?
[4:24:45] <%Pookiedaexzile> Vampyr incoming
[4:24:49] <oedocontroller> sick
[4:24:51] <XxMoliciousxX> khronites!!
[4:24:52] <%BonewheelVanguard> FOR KHORNE
[4:24:55] <%Niney_Who> Hood might look good as an alternate to the Red Hood
[4:24:58] <%Dakuu75> question: Do you ever get invaded by Dialos? or get anything from him (quest wise)? Or should I jsut kill him?
[4:24:59] <sjcodan> YUP
[4:25:02] <oedocontroller> it's not raw xD
[4:25:02] <NewWillinium> Pat met the Lord of blood aaaaages ago. Could probably murk him pretty easily now
[4:25:03] <joodatious> BLOOD TELEPORTER
[4:25:05] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> the blood is coming THROUGH the teleporter
[4:25:05] <%boggsz12> wait nvm you're going now lol
[4:25:06] <%Valdorick> Its covered in blood, so you know its evil
[4:25:06] <$HeyItsSirBanana> Oh look, magic but hole
[4:25:06] <some_brave_apollo> it's a BLOODY teleporter
[4:25:07] <sjcodan> ITS JUST A RANDOM FUCKING TELEPORT
[4:25:08] <Komayeda> And there's *blood* all over it
[4:25:08] <+Tredecian> blood dripping tp lol
[4:25:09] <TwistParabola> blood-covered
[4:25:12] <Aussie_Manny> ow
[4:25:16] <leole11> it's a bit bloody :p
[4:25:17] <zenith0111> YOU DID IT PAT
[4:25:19] <%dekkitout> Advanced darkness
[4:25:21] <Aussie_Manny> Can't see shit.
[4:25:22] <bakademic> hole
[4:25:23] <sirrice77> @Dakuu75 straight up idk what happens with diallos after volcano manor. I have no idea what happens to him
[4:25:27] <oedocontroller> this is a blood area
[4:25:28] <%Valdorick> Yeah, you can likely this kill Satan now.
[4:25:28] <Baeltyr> @sirrice77 ok sweet, i thought i was jumping into areas way past my lvl, so good to know
[4:25:30] <%Pookiedaexzile> NEW ZONE
[4:25:33] <Aussie_Manny> What the/!
[4:25:35] <sjcodan> USE YOUR EYES
[4:25:40] <eleskei> satans mansion
[4:25:42] <joodatious> lmao
[4:25:43] <%pinkslimegoblin> I missed this shit
[4:25:44] <%furiousfurioso> I WONDERED WHAT THAT FUCKING CAVE WAS FOR
[4:25:45] <sjcodan> ACTUALLY NEW ZONE
[4:25:50] <%Valdorick> Pat came here at, what, level 60?
[4:25:53] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> a questline pop's you here
[4:25:53] <%dekkitout> New Zone .5
[4:25:57] <some_brave_apollo> this zone is a lot shorter than it looks i feel
[4:25:59] <%whyskeywolfe> Pat pledged his soul to the Blood God and got here early
[4:26:02] <%nip_nips> NEW OLD ZONE
[4:26:04] <sjcodan> Oh, he got here the other way?
[4:26:05] <fistynopunches> Blood Hell
[4:26:06] <%Dakuu75> @sirrice77 yeah, he never gave me any quests or anything in the manor, then he just peaced out. (I was thinking I shoulda jsut killed him for loot.)
[4:26:06] <leole11> he has been here, there's a quest that just straight up tps you here
[4:26:06] <Komayeda> Yeah, I just got here like, an hour ago
[4:26:07] <sjcodan> Neat
[4:26:11] <NewWillinium> So from what I gather about the lore of the game, the boss here is ACTUALLY the worst person in the game. . . by miles
[4:26:12] <Augus7717> wait there i thought the teleporter was the only way to get here whats the other way? @PatStaresAt
[4:26:13] <%EldritchBee> Zone that you're now the technical level to be in
[4:26:15] <sirrice77> @Baeltyr basically if you can do decent damage and not get instantly murdered then you're good to do it
[4:26:15] <%Valdorick> The boss one shot him with his WEAKEST ATTACK
[4:26:23] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> but this time he's proper leveled
[4:26:26] <Aussie_Manny> Oh, this place.
[4:26:28] <%boggsz12> they really aren't?
[4:26:29] <oedocontroller> there is a lot of zones you get teleported to that you should not be at before post-capital
[4:26:29] <%dekkitout> Oh man is this place bloodtown?
[4:26:31] <Aussie_Manny> It's the leveling zone!
[4:26:34] <%Monkeyweed21> @Augus7717 do the varre questline and you get an item to teleport here
[4:26:35] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @NewWillinium Him and Dung Eater, for sure.
[4:26:36] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt you can absolutely beat mohg now
[4:26:37] <fistynopunches> very strong frog blood bois
[4:26:45] <%Pookiedaexzile> What's Da Smell
[4:26:46] <DerpioParty> Who spilled all this Hawaiian Punch on the floor?

[4:26:50] <sjcodan> GO MOG MOHG
[4:26:51] <zenith0111> @newwillinium That title can be a lot of people in this tbh
[4:26:55] <Aussie_Manny> The real rune farm prize is the bird.
[4:26:56] <bakademic> poisin swap?
[4:26:57] <sjcodan> BIRD UP
[4:26:58] <lethallylactic> monkaS
[4:27:00] <%dekkitout> Yharnamites would love to vacation here
[4:27:02] <Aussie_Manny> Speaking of which
[4:27:02] <sirrice77> @Dakuu75 from what i know. Diallos drops the same whip as his brother from the volcano manor invasions and his mask which looks like his brothers but with different horns
[4:27:03] <+anoldtoilet> lol
[4:27:03] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> BAGAWK
[4:27:04] <digaogrunge> The white masked no maidens dude, he ever shows up again or he stays at that bloody church?

[4:27:13] <oedocontroller> "the irony"
[4:27:13] <Aussie_Manny> OH FUCK
[4:27:14] <%Pookiedaexzile> 2 Piece and A Biscuit
[4:27:15] <joodatious> Dung Eater is the most fucked character in these games for sure
[4:27:15] <+ChaosedStar> bloodborne crows heard us talking shit
[4:27:16] <%Valdorick> Certainly not any White Mask you would know!
[4:27:16] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> ARISE CHICKEN!
[4:27:17] <+Funky_Honkey> this place sucks
[4:27:17] <%MaybeFalco> watch out pat
[4:27:18] <+zashr_> oh
[4:27:19] <ArgentUndaCova> Wtf there's an invader there too?
[4:27:19] <MidnightPacif1c> caelid 2
[4:27:19] <athuramn> how did you know where these people were?
[4:27:20] <digaogrunge> oh
[4:27:21] <%dekkitout> Everything about that encounter was cursed
[4:27:22] <+anoldtoilet> @digaogrunge he literally just invaded.
[4:27:22] <mrcelab> so this is gonna suck
[4:27:23] <%boggsz12> yeah he invades in the meanest place possible
[4:27:23] <Strigiform> those birds are possibly the hardest mobs
[4:27:25] <NewWillinium> That Bird is one of my most hated enemies in any game ever
[4:27:25] <Baeltyr> hey its the die in a ditch guy
[4:27:28] <+BoboDaHobo> he got his revenge
[4:27:30] <%greasypete00> so do you actually have to invade to get this guys quest done
[4:27:32] <fistynopunches> does anyone know what the weird red growths on the crows are?
[4:27:32] <+Saunt> force kill it before you head down?
[4:27:35] <leole11> i HATE the birds
[4:27:38] <+anoldtoilet> yes
[4:27:40] <peachy996> Good try
[4:27:41] <%Dakuu75> @sirrice77 oh ok, so nothing even that special, unless you wanna duel-whip
[4:27:41] <%EldritchBee> @joodatious I killed dung eater simply because he made me GENUINELY uncomfortable
[4:27:45] <Baeltyr> booo dinner breaks
[4:27:47] <digaogrunge> @digaogrunge perfect timing

[4:28:16] <%Valdorick> @greasypete00 You could always invade then server finger. Since you don't have to win, I doubt the game is tracking anything complex.

[4:30:45] <Aussie_Manny> I like these guys. When I see an enemy, I also start cartwheeling.
[4:30:46] <ohno58> @oedocontroller Castles are fun though.
[4:30:48] <joodatious> there should be more poison swamps honestly

[4:47:32] <+alphonseisbest> THE OTHER SECRECT MEDALLEN LUL

[4:47:36] <digaogrunge> Ensha was a bitch tho
[4:47:39] <joodatious> mohg needed that demi-bussy
[4:47:40] <+swesterly> @swesterly mohg smash bros discord mod confirmed
[4:47:44] <rosabellamelantha> @EldritchBee No he straight up says he wanted to be Miquella's consort
[4:47:48] <%Valdorick> @EldritchBee He forced Milquella into bed and when Milquella protested, he killed him...
[4:47:54] <Minorou> subtitles need that grammar pass
[4:48:00] <+MarkoTolstov> So the lore for Mohg and Miquella is like, *INCREDIBLY* fucked up lol
[4:48:01] <%Valdorick> The phrase "consecrate their union" is used.
[4:48:01] <ArgentUndaCova> Mohg the Satan pervert mopCringe
[4:48:08] <Komayeda> apparently this next one is the hardest boss in the game

[4:48:32] <Namillus> .... wait
[4:48:33] <zenith0111> The Formless Mother.
[4:48:33] <%twohitgood> is this a bloodboon?
[4:48:34] <joodatious> though its debatable
[4:48:35] <%Valdorick> He's empowered by a non-golden order God
[4:48:36] <Namillus> The Formless Mother?
[4:48:37] <iteruq> FORMLESS ODEON
[4:48:38] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> @EldritchBee Miquella is still alive, i think Mogh was trying to use him to bring his to life
[4:48:39] <domukujira> isnt miquella a child
[4:48:41] <+eanscrale> Mohg had eyes on the inside
[4:48:41] <Namillus> Formless Oedon????
[4:48:42] <rosabellamelantha> also yeah Mohg tried to literally force him into sex and then murdered him when Miquella said no
[4:48:43] <%BonewheelVanguard> its a Bloodboon

[4:48:55] <TwistParabola> read his remembrance
[4:48:56] <NewWillinium> You can also get his robes. I rocked it for the rest of the game.
[4:48:57] <bakademic> WOUNDS FOR THE WOUND GOD

[4:49:08] <senfood> I don't want to say it was aliens...but it was aliens.
[4:49:10] <+MarkoTolstov> Not only was Mohg in love with a dead guy THAT HE KILLED, but the dead body was literally permanently in an infant form LUL What a freak.
[4:49:10] <%Dakuu75> @sjcodan oh nooooooo lol
[4:49:14] <%xcompleasedad> What does the Rune do?
[4:49:20] <MoustacheCEO> @EldritchBee Mogh is struggle snuggling Miquellas coma body to bring the formless mother into the world I think
[4:49:21] <domukujira> so mohg touches kids
[4:49:21] <%Felhad> @patstaresat "Wishing to raise Miquella to full godhood, Mohg wished to become his consort, taking the role of monarch. But no matter how much of his bloody bedchamber he tried to share, he received no response from the young Empyrean."
[4:49:21] <%Maids4lyfe> OEDON THE FORMLESS ONE?
[4:49:31] <TheSandmanIsHere> I mean you might actually want to use that one and grab the incantation?
[4:49:34] <%Valdorick> OH! Pat, his rune, acitavte it
[4:49:34] <%TheGuesty> @PatStaresAt Decided on which +10 Unique or +25 weapon?
[4:49:37] <oda_flobunaga> @xcompleasedad it makes summons better
[4:49:39] <%EldritchBee> @xcompleasedad It's only for multiplayer summons
[4:49:45] <@QueequegTheater> I'm back, what I miss
[4:49:48] <%Valdorick> He's at his brother's

[4:49:57] <%NBUsagi> @Felhad Thats a big yikes
[4:49:58] <senfood> The Outer Ones have been fucking up this world for a long ass time. If there's any DLC, you're gonna go fight the big one.
[4:50:00] <%tetraes> Read Description?
[4:50:02] <Sunstalker> Pat, how did you beat Alecto again? She's kicking my ass with my mace
[4:50:05] <phoenix_games87> Do you want to know how to get to halitree Pat?
[4:50:07] <+anoldtoilet> dung eater probably worse
[4:50:07] <MoustacheCEO> @joodatious Dung Eater is arguably worse
[4:50:08] <TwistParabola> read description
[4:50:09] <%Fenrisulfr_V> East Altus
[4:50:16] <+anoldtoilet> yeah there are several outer gods it seems its cool
[4:50:19] <Tenebrae94> pat read the boss soul lore @patstaresat
[4:50:24] <MoustacheCEO> Dung Eater did nothing wrong though
[4:50:31] <Gray_LoFi> Also what's the causality spell do?
[4:50:37] <+swesterly> the outer gods sound like bad news
[4:50:38] <%NBUsagi> No Mohg is bad, but from what i have read the Dung Eater is actually worse XD
[4:50:43] <+alphonseisbest> @anoldtoilet what did Dung water do?
[4:50:46] <+swesterly> but greater will kind of sucks too

[4:51:00] <%Valdorick> That rune is GREAT.
[4:51:00] <TwistParabola> bruh indeed
[4:51:03] <sothatsprettybrutal> should probably work on getting the blood out of that bedchamber before sharing it
[4:51:04] <joodatious> ohh?
[4:51:05] <+anoldtoilet> @alphonseisbest he pretty much does nothing but murder people and have sex with their corpses all day
[4:51:06] <sothatsprettybrutal> unsanitary
[4:51:08] <digaogrunge> Oh gay satan was in love
[4:51:08] <%watts121> Miquella was male.

[4:51:36] <TwistParabola> summons or just phantoms?
[4:51:39] <%sporeian94> Satan being gay is in line, after all he constantly disguises himself as a school girl in SMT
[4:51:42] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt reminder that Miquella was also his half brother
[4:51:42] <%Fenrisulfr_V> You get an item while invdaing people that buffs nearby enemy mobs.
[4:51:43] <%Niney_Who> Polnareff did you lay this egg
[4:51:44] <TrollKing96> Forgot to read the rest of the lore
[4:51:47] <TwistParabola> bruh
[4:51:47] <NewWillinium> You Egg stuck as a child bro
[4:51:50] <ape_hawk> it wasnt consensual, tho

[4:51:52] <%tetraes> His Child Body Egg Bro lol
[4:51:56] <xSelfs> hey Pat, are  you playing at stable 60fps?
[4:51:57] <Zourath> @DrFacilier It gives an item that you can use to buff hostile mobs when you invade.
[4:51:58] <jubejube56> As you do
[4:51:59] <%TINMANxHMx> ahhh yes, the big gay for egg pro phase
[4:51:59] <%Monkeyweed21> Miquella is cursed to be an eternal child
[4:52:06] <TheBlankAce> Its the big gay for the eternally youthful egg dude he abducted though
[4:52:10] <+anoldtoilet> lol
[4:52:10] <DestroPrime83> Does Pat is the Gay?
[4:52:10] <@QueequegTheater> Miquella was also a little boy
[4:52:11] <+croutonian> im stuck in the eggussy half-bro
[4:52:11] <+silver__viii> D:
[4:52:12] <ArgentUndaCova> Mohg wanted to fuck a child mopCringe
[4:52:13] <digaogrunge> You think he sexed that egg?
[4:52:16] <+MarkoTolstov> Big gay for your BABY egg bro
[4:52:17] <%Valdorick> Oh, and you get a consumable when you succeed an invasion that lets you buff mobs in the host's world.
[4:52:18] <%Ynkubus_> Who'd've thunk that gods like this are fucked up and evil
[4:52:18] <GenericTwitchAcc1> D:
[4:52:25] <sjcodan> We KNOW he sexed the egg
[4:52:29] <%xcompleasedad> Has he seen the giant yet?
[4:52:31] <rosabellamelantha> I would like to point out Malenia ALSO wanted to be his consort so it's incest all the way down
[4:52:31] <+DrFacilier> @Zourath oh christ...
[4:52:31] <+MarkoTolstov> Miquella was permanently stuck as an infant, it’s fucked
[4:52:39] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt Mogh is basically that guy from Berserk that Griffith fucked for money
[4:52:40] <+ReallyBigRocks> Fuck mages
[4:52:46] <+WutangchickeN> wtfSpin wtfSpin wtfSpin
[4:52:46] <+swesterly> so what precisely does his rune do
[4:52:49] <%twistedj3ster> that was my favorite part of the game
[4:52:53] <joodatious> didn't Gwyn basically force his son to be a girl?
[4:52:59] <joodatious> these gods are just awful
[4:53:01] <+anoldtoilet> @rosabellamelantha and people say they cant see the GRRM influence
[4:53:05] <%NBUsagi> As an infant or as a child? cause there is lore that does describe him able to like...do things and he is even apart of a specific religious order? Miquella i mean
[4:53:07] <jubejube56> You care for their respecs
[4:53:09] <ArgentUndaCova> Wtf where are all these Pat balls coming from mopSweat
[4:53:10] <senfood> awooo
[4:53:18] <%Call_Me_Deacon_Blues> moon magic is pretty hype tho
[4:53:20] <sjcodan> Did that wolf just Plesioth hipcheck you?
[4:53:20] <%Monkeyweed21> @joodatious the pantheon needed more bussy
[4:53:21] <+ReallyBigRocks> woof woof
[4:53:22] <rosabellamelantha> @NBUsagi Child physically not mentally
[4:53:23] <@QueequegTheater> @rosabellamelantha Man, everyone but Radahn is assholes
[4:53:24] <+Silv3rS0und> SIG?
[4:53:26] <ohno58> oh shit kurama
[4:53:33] <TwistParabola> speaking of Raya Lucaria...
[4:53:38] <joodatious> @Monkeyweed21 thats fair
[4:53:41] <GenericTwitchAcc1> magic wolf is cool tho
[4:53:41] <goddesstabrasa> Sif is that you? lol
[4:53:45] <+MarkoTolstov> @nbusagi I forget where, but I specifically remember the word “infant” used to describe his perpetual form
[4:53:48] <%Valdorick> @swesterly Buffs Spirits, if you summon a co-op player, you'll activate their rune for them, and if you invade, you copy the host's equiped rune, and if you win, get an item that lets you buff invaded player's mobs
[4:53:49] <joodatious> most pantheons could use more bussy
[4:53:49] <ohno58> he's buffin the wolves
[4:53:50] <rosabellamelantha> @rosabellamelantha I mean it's implied he actually loved his sister so that's at l;east consensual
[4:53:54] <joodatious> looking at you jesus
[4:54:04] <%NBUsagi> @NBUsagi ahh like Detective Konan if i remember that name right
[4:54:11] <%Call_Me_Deacon_Blues> roaming boss fights
[4:54:14] <sothatsprettybrutal> Incantation: Invisible Fencing
[4:54:25] <sjcodan> Just an asshole
[4:54:27] <NewWillinium> He's just an asshole I think
[4:54:27] <sjcodan> Not even a boss
[4:54:31] <+ReallyBigRocks> these red wolves look great
[4:54:31] <rosabellamelantha> @NBUsagi yeah basically detective konan
[4:54:31] <%BonewheelVanguard> God I hope these Wolves become summons in the DLC
[4:54:34] <$Artoo__The_Me> The second
[4:54:42] <joodatious> these wolves look so cool
[4:55:00] <%EldritchBee> Consort I think doesn't mean "literally get married" in every case, I think it just means "someone to be the Elden Lord to the God"
[4:55:06] <%Valdorick> Like, with the bloodrune active, a Mimic Tear +10 does ~90% of your damage, instead of ~80%.
[4:55:07] <KatabolicRage> Cliffords gonna magic missle your ass
[4:55:10] <+ReallyBigRocks> especially at night with the lighting from the spells
[4:55:18] <+ReallyBigRocks> very cool
[4:55:22] <kinkade_77> nooooo

[4:55:29] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt btw the lore for the raging wolf set states that wolves aren't natural and are sentries of the two fingers so blame them for this
[4:55:30] <sjcodan> mothJam mothJam mothJam mothJam

[4:55:35] <Khester824> no
[4:55:39] <sjcodan> Nop
[4:55:43] <Midnight188> Overconfidence something something killer
[4:55:44] <sjcodan> He's JUST an asshole
[4:55:44] <joodatious> @EldritchBee it depends, there is a certain consort that seems VERY marriage
[4:55:48] <digaogrunge> I hope modders can make us ride the magic red sif someday

[4:56:40] <sjcodan> THERES NOTHING TO BE GAINED
[4:56:40] <jubejube56> That’s why there are wolves outside of Ranni’s tower?
[4:56:41] <+kongx24> thats why three finger's are the best waifu
[4:56:41] <+swesterly> ok so all the gods and demi gods suck sure whatever but isn't ranni the best
[4:56:42] <sothatsprettybrutal> wolves hate rocks
[4:56:48] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> DOES THIS MEAN ZANGEIF DOESNT EXIST?!?
[4:56:49] <sjcodan> THIS WOLF IS JUST AN ASSHOLE

[4:57:18] <Guardiansaiyan> Zangief is a DOGGO and not a wolf...therefore REAL! VirtualHug <3 VirtualHug
[4:57:19] <sjcodan> Ranni is the best, yes
[4:57:33] <+swesterly> @swesterly but that's just demi-god revolution, if the prior order sucks ass then wasn't that for the best?
[4:57:38] <%EldritchBee> Ranni is the reason everything's a bit fucked rn, so not quite
[4:57:41] <+ATorL> That's not what it says, it says that "According to old legends, wolves are shadows of the Empyrean" that's not quite the same thing

[5:00:31] <joodatious> she doesn't have red hair though?
[5:00:32] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> a lot of characters share similar names... or use 2 names for some reason that are real similar
[5:00:35] <Ghufufin> its wheel of time all over again
[5:00:36] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Melina has purple hair
[5:00:36] <joodatious> pretty sure its brown
[5:00:38] <%TheAdMerlin> Ranni's corpse had redhair too

[5:00:39] <cthulu_fearlock> purdy
[5:00:40] <+eanscrale> melina has red hair?
[5:00:41] <+LandOfTheWay> marika didn't have much imagination when it came to names
[5:00:41] <%sporeian94> Dual and Mistaken Identity appears to be a big part of this game
[5:00:41] <+croutonian> melina doesnt have red hair
[5:00:42] <leole11> @ape_hawk they're hommonculi
[5:00:47] <+Shoosler> @sjcodan lol I didn't notice that xD good point

[5:01:18] <it_came_from_outer_space> I think
[5:01:18] <%Valdorick> Fuck'n wizard tower
[5:01:18] <%Fenrisulfr_V> All of Radagon's kids have red hair.
[5:01:19] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> You were right beside it
[5:01:20] <TwistParabola> yeah
[5:01:26] <joodatious> more important question
[5:01:26] <%papabigrooster> papabigrooster subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months! Hey Pat I’ve been slogging through all the Elden Ring VODs and since I’m starting my first engineering job I thought I sub for reals since I’ve been watching since the Machinima days keep pondering dat orb.
[5:01:27] <TheSandmanIsHere> think there's a theory that bonfire girl is descended from rot goddess
[5:01:30] <joodatious> would you fuck your mimic tear?
[5:01:31] <%EldritchBee> I thought Godfrey and Godwyn were the same person for 99% of the game
[5:01:31] <%Fenrisulfr_V> It's why they're called the "Red-haired Stepchildren"
[5:01:35] <@QueequegTheater> @CoogiDown2MySocks You're too late to spoil that twist so I won't time you out
[5:01:39] <%Felhad> yes
[5:01:40] <WillSin4Cash> Arise, ye tarnished!
[5:01:41] <%whyskeywolfe> There's a dragon in the ravine
[5:01:43] <+LandOfTheWay> every time the lore brings up the Greater Will, it makes me think of SMT
[5:01:46] <micolash28> yes the asylum demon
[5:01:48] <%EldritchBee> @TheSandmanIsHere Melina literally says her mom is Marika
[5:01:49] <TwistParabola> I'm partial to the theory that Melina is one of Marika's children
[5:01:54] <%Valdorick> This guy doesn't have much HP
[5:01:54] <+CoogiDown2MySocks> @CoogiDown2MySocks i didn't even say anything
[5:01:58] <+ReallyBigRocks> extra stinky
[5:02:01] <rosabellamelantha> You're next to rot land
[5:02:03] <+CoogiDown2MySocks> yall quick to shoot
[5:02:07] <TwistParabola> @TheSandmanIsHere she more implies at it
[5:02:11] <%Monkeyweed21> @TheSandmanIsHere the red hair is a consistent feature across many of Radagon's kids
[5:02:21] <zenith0111> @twistparabola Only makes sense once you know more about Marika
[5:02:28] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @TwistParabola HIghly likely. Red-haired, one of her eyes is cursed, etc.
[5:02:31] <sjcodan> A bit harsh there, Qeequeg, he didn't even spoil anything
[5:02:34] <jubejube56> Oh god a rot one
[5:02:38] <@QueequegTheater> @CoogiDown2MySocks "Tee hee there's a reason for the red hair, it's a secret tho you'll never guess it Kappa "
[5:02:41] <digaogrunge> NICE
[5:02:45] <@QueequegTheater> Sure buddy

[5:04:00] <@QueequegTheater> @CoogiDown2MySocks I might be, but it has happened in multiple streams where some """genius""" thinks they're being cryptic and it spoils Pat or Woolie
[5:04:01] <peachy996> SLOG
[5:04:07] <rosabellamelantha> yep
[5:04:11] <peachy996> Slog is a fun word

[5:05:34] <Khester824> hardest puzzle in the game
[5:05:34] <zenith0111> SHHHH
[5:05:35] <sirrice77> man i did not find this
[5:05:36] <%RealThiele> welp found a mine out here and got my shit wrecked by the boss holy shit
[5:05:42] <joodatious> hehe they're dancing
[5:05:46] <+CoogiDown2MySocks> @CoogiDown2MySocks i can understand the feeling to react
[5:05:46] <WillSin4Cash> I hated this
[5:05:51] <%Aeoneth> Got this in like 2 minutes
[5:05:51] <%Monkeyweed21> oh I get it
[5:05:51] <TwistParabola> they're making out
[5:05:52] <%Fenrisulfr_V> I figured this out pretty quickly, actually. Mostly because I was also watching Plague make his character at the same time as I was doing this.
[5:05:54] <sothatsprettybrutal> hmm
[5:06:01] <leole11> unironically didn't finish it even after knowing the answer, i was that pissed
[5:06:10] <%tetraes> theres a hint by the door if i remember correctly
[5:06:16] <%kewlmyc> kewlmyc subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 40 months! Question.  I am doing the grape chick's quest and got to the point where you need to get the special grape from the invader.  Dude never showed up, and when googling it, I found your tweet where you said you also couldn't get the invader to show up.  Did you ever manage to proceed, or is the quest just fucked for you?
[5:06:17] <TwistParabola> oh he doesnt have them
[5:06:20] <zenith0111> omg you didnt find the merchant for them lol
[5:06:28] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @PatStaresAt Raya Lucaria bridge merchant sells them.
[5:06:31] <TwistParabola> lol. lmao
[5:06:37] <%Aeoneth> maybe a scriptstone will reveal extra dev clues?
[5:06:59] <zenith0111> Hr had the answer in his head but not in his inventory
[5:07:03] <+typicalTablesalt> have a nice dinner pat
[5:07:05] <joodatious> now what this game needs is a questlog on the screen
[5:07:08] <KobeTeeth90> pat have u touched gracetoday?
[5:07:10] <RubberFistFight> that quest is busted for a load of people. it was working for me, and then all of a sudden it wasn't. nobody knows if it's a bug or a seemingly unrelated quest flagging it as failed.
[5:07:15] <%radiorosewater> yummy give food
[5:07:15] <@Fuggins4U> bon appetit
[5:07:17] <joodatious> Kappa
[5:07:24] <Guardiansaiyan> ????
[5:07:24] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> @Fenrisulfr_V in a fight, maureen is apparently summoned. one of millicent's sisters
[5:07:24] <Baeltyr> rush
[5:07:25] <%MaybeFalco> too late gone
[5:07:29] <joodatious> everyone leave hurry!
[5:07:30] <Baeltyr> speedrun dinner
[5:07:36] <darce_avidson> @RubberFistFight which quest?
[5:07:41] <Sunstalker> Fuck yeah, just beat Alecto by repelling his bloodfire projectile back at him PogChamp
[5:07:45] <dantheskeleman> Lol I just got here lol
[5:07:48] <Baeltyr> so what scrimblo does pat need?
[5:07:49] <sjcodan> The ONLY thing this game needs is a "Complete" marker on side caves once you beat the boss
[5:07:52] <%RealThiele> now that pats gone, FUCK ASTEL
[5:07:53] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I Oh, right. There's the two named sisters and the two numbered sisters.
[5:07:53] <%MaybeFalco> i too, also have food
[5:07:55] <Midnight188> clearly you just scrimblo the blimbo and there you go door open
[5:07:55] <%abakkus> and now we jam waynerGoChimp waynerGoChimp waynerGoChimp
[5:07:56] <joodatious> it sure is cool that patches is the final boss
[5:07:57] <zenith0111> @rubberfistfight Gotta kill both imps and replace them with your summoned imps
[5:08:02] <@QueequegTheater> @RubberFistFight 2nd playthrough I went all the way up to Dragonkin Tree Sentinel and back then started the quest and it still worked fine, it seems completely random
[5:08:04] <RubberFistFight> @RubberFistFight >nobody knows - it's like you didn't even read my comment...
[5:08:08] <zenith0111> @rubberfistfight Is the idea
[5:08:11] <+GilroyGoldBlood> vineKermiepls vineKermiepls vineKermiepls
[5:08:17] <sjcodan> mothDance mothJam mothDance mothJam mothDance mothJam mothDance mothJam
[5:08:18] <Baeltyr> @zenith0111 really? man this game
[5:08:21] <%baka_sugoi> Pat Mukbangs At
[5:08:30] <@QueequegTheater> @RubberFistFight @darce_avidson Hyetta's quest
[5:08:32] <%abakkus> waynerGoOff waynerGoChimp waynerGoOff waynerGoChimp waynerGoOff waynerGoChimp
[5:08:36] <$bcdenton> hey newwillinium, that might be a spoiler chief
[5:08:38] <%Felhad> ironmouseWiggly ironmouseWiggly ironmouseWiggly ironmouseWiggly ironmouseWiggly
[5:08:42] <@QueequegTheater> @RubberFistFight You misread his comment Kappa
[5:08:51] <%baka_sugoi> SourPls
[5:09:01] <Khester824> is he eating more hotdogs?
[5:09:06] <RubberFistFight> @QueequegTheater no i didn't, he was asking about the grape girl quest
[5:09:11] <joodatious> @zenith0111 thats incredible
[5:09:15] <RubberFistFight> and that vyke isn't spawning
[5:09:27] <@QueequegTheater> @QueequegTheater He said which quest and you said nobody knows
[5:09:55] <RubberFistFight> @QueequegTheater I assumed he was asking about which quest flags Hyetta's as failed.
[5:10:05] <NewWillinium> After watching Pat try and get Vyke to spawn for so long, I just ran into him while exploring.   I *have* to wonder what made it that broke Pat's questline
[5:10:11] <joodatious> I assumed pat killed Rykard?
[5:10:12] <zenith0111> Can we discuss the fact all magic is space magic?
[5:10:12] <@QueequegTheater> @QueequegTheater I think he was just asking which quest was borked
[5:10:21] <@QueequegTheater> @joodatious Much earlier
[5:10:30] <RubberFistFight> @QueequegTheater the original comment said it was hyetta's though...
[5:10:36] <joodatious> Rykard is my favorite version of the "storm ruler" fight
[5:10:39] <RyuuAoi> How long we been on BRB?
[5:10:42] <NewWillinium> @joodatious Oh yeah. He and his mimic slaughtered Rykard. Didn't even get to do his Flaming Skull
[5:10:44] <joodatious> mainly because it still feels like an actual boss
[5:10:52] <%Felhad> @ryuuaoi like 2mins
[5:10:54] <joodatious> awesome
[5:10:57] <NewWillinium> @RyuuAoi Like 3 minutes? Pat went to go eat.
[5:10:59] <Baeltyr> @RyuuAoi like 2 min
[5:11:00] <joodatious> i love his cutscene
[5:11:17] <@QueequegTheater> @QueequegTheater "that quest is busted for a load of people".  You were responding to someone but the original comment wasn't linked
[5:11:17] <RyuuAoi> Cool
[5:11:22] <joodatious> cant wait for pat to get the world change event
[5:11:30] <@QueequegTheater> I win once again Kappa
[5:11:39] <joodatious> i was worried there would be no moments when the world changed from story events
[5:11:42] <RubberFistFight> @QueequegTheater it'
[5:11:49] <joodatious> but this is the biggest in any of the games i love it
[5:11:57] <RubberFistFight> @QueequegTheater it's linked for me, though. if i could show you a screenshot i would.
[5:12:18] <NewWillinium> So. . .speaking of NPC questlines.  Where do y'all think Kenneth and Nephali's quests would have gone if they had been completed?
[5:12:21] <@QueequegTheater> It's fine
[5:12:21] <darce_avidson> Wanna know one major issue I personally have w/Elden Ring?
[5:12:28] <@QueequegTheater> @darce_avidson Not big enough
[5:12:32] <DuckAlfred> Food time
[5:12:41] <@QueequegTheater> catJAM
[5:12:42] <zenith0111> @darce_avidson Its too good
[5:12:46] <darce_avidson> How hard it is to find NPCs for later steps of their questlines
[5:13:04] <darce_avidson> like, not even saying "oh I'll be exactly here on the map"
[5:13:07] <joodatious> i mean they try to help you atleast
[5:13:09] <NewWillinium> That is a legitamite problem.
[5:13:14] <zenith0111> Thats how they make the gane repayable
[5:13:15] <joodatious> well when it comes to certain characters
[5:13:15] <darce_avidson> just no indication where they're going whatsoever
[5:13:17] <darce_avidson> see millicent
[5:13:32] <+swesterly> so who is the corpse in fia's arena
[5:13:40] <+swesterly> is that the outer god of death?
[5:13:46] <joodatious> I mean there is nothing saying they have to tell you
[5:13:47] <darce_avidson> godwyn
[5:13:55] <darce_avidson> after severe decay/bloating
[5:13:57] <NewWillinium> I *think* that's supposed to be Godwyn the Golden.
[5:13:59] <%Felhad> Prince of Death
[5:14:00] <TheSandmanIsHere> @newwillinium I know where they've gone: DLC
[5:14:08] <joodatious> and it would kinda take away the fun of completing quests since it would just be like any other game
[5:14:12] <NewWillinium> Who I presume was the Balder figure of the lore.
[5:14:16] <%Felhad> Nah, Godwyn's body is in Lyndell
[5:14:26] <%EldritchBee> It's Godwyn.
[5:14:31] <zenith0111> Godwyn died in Spirit but his Body lives
[5:14:40] <%EldritchBee> @Felhad Fia's arena is underneath Lyndell
[5:14:41] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @Felhad The Prince of Death IS Godwyn, though.
[5:14:42] <darce_avidson> hard confirmed godwyn, yeah
[5:14:42] <TheSandmanIsHere> Godwyn's face is under Stormveil and in Lyndell at the same time
[5:14:44] <+swesterly> yeah the text did say godwyn decayed and became prince of death
[5:14:56] <+swesterly> so is he and fia the avatar for the outer god of death
[5:15:03] <@QueequegTheater> It would be fine if From just added in some kind of record of NPC dialogue so you can check "Oh, she said she was going to Scrimblo Cave 6"
[5:15:04] <TheSandmanIsHere> also he has a dragon in his brain now
[5:15:09] <%Felhad> Huh, guess I missed that
[5:15:17] <darce_avidson> which is weird that he's a weird fish monster thing now, since he originally looked like a normal dude
[5:15:24] <zenith0111> The ancient dragons seem like assholes
[5:15:28] <+swesterly> right
[5:15:38] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @QueequegTheater I've been talking to friends about it, and a Morrowind-style journal would do a lot.
[5:15:40] <RubberFistFight> @QueequegTheater half the time they don't even say that though. They just spout some whimsical bullshit and then despawn
[5:15:46] <RubberFistFight> and show up in a completely random-ass location
[5:15:46] <@QueequegTheater> I dunno, the dragons actually seem pretty neutral
[5:15:48] <+swesterly> are there any details about the outer god worshiped by placidusax?
[5:15:52] <TheSandmanIsHere> bad things happen when you murder someone's soul and leave their body alive, especially when they're a demigod
[5:16:02] <darce_avidson> the one rolling around inside godwyn seems pretty cool
[5:16:06] <joodatious> dragons are just weirdos who wanna be left alone
[5:16:24] <NewWillinium> So are those who Live in Death . . . literally just Tarnished? Just the Bone Skellies?
[5:16:25] <@QueequegTheater> Like, Placidusax is a prick but most of the other dragons are kinda just sitting around
[5:16:25] <darce_avidson> since it's been explicitly trying to fight off the influence of death in his body
[5:16:26] <+swesterly> assumedly the outer god of time
[5:16:32] <@QueequegTheater> @NewWillinium Undead
[5:16:37] <zenith0111> They created their own religion about themselves by preaching how dope they are
[5:16:44] <jubejube56> If dragons want to be left alone why do they drop dragon hearts?
[5:16:50] <@QueequegTheater> @zenith0111 You would too if you were a dragon
[5:16:57] <TheSandmanIsHere> Those Who Live In Death are Hollowed
[5:17:02] <RubberFistFight> @QueequegTheater Placidusax? I haven't seen that one yet, where's he at?
[5:17:06] <NewWillinium> @NewWillinium Yes but does that include Tarnished?
[5:17:06] <+swesterly> tarnished rejected the order imposed by the elden ring (life and death) and are thus undead/immortal
[5:17:12] <zenith0111> Yeah but as a dragon not disguised as a preist
[5:17:18] <@QueequegTheater> @QueequegTheater Superboss
[5:17:19] <joodatious> @QueequegTheater farum azula
[5:17:20] <+swesterly> @QueequegTheater he's a secret boss in farum azula
[5:17:26] <%Brassnarwhal> is this the dinner break?
[5:17:27] <darce_avidson> I find it funny that compared to Dark Souls's view on dragon worship, Elden Ring's view is "yeah they're pretty cool"
[5:17:53] <+swesterly> there are a lot of lore parallels actually
[5:17:54] <@QueequegTheater> Ya know
[5:18:01] <@QueequegTheater> Some are dicks, some are chill
[5:18:02] <+swesterly> the dragons being beyond time, everlasting etc
[5:18:12] <%Brassnarwhal> @darce_avidson the dragon communion spells say that people who overindulge in communion become wyrms
[5:18:17] <+LandOfTheWay> @QueequegTheater wait, why is placidusax a dick? all the lore i've seen just said he used to rule, not that he was a notable asshole
[5:18:18] <RubberFistFight> @QueequegTheater some just wanna fuck cars and be left alone
[5:18:21] <joodatious> my favorite thing about elden ring is that i can now make my character into a twink and nobody can stop me
[5:18:34] <NewWillinium> Two Fingers: Yeah Dragons are lit. You can worship them too
[5:18:36] <@QueequegTheater> @LandOfTheWay He worshipped a space monster
[5:18:37] <darce_avidson> @Brassnarwhal I mean the actual kingdom allowed dragon worship
[5:18:42] <zenith0111> Only difference is becoming a Dragon is legit when in Dark Souls its never happening
[5:18:52] <+swesterly> they all worshipped space monsters
[5:18:54] <darce_avidson> not munching on dragon bits
[5:18:56] <zenith0111> Theyre just gone
[5:19:06] <%Brassnarwhal> I'm working on graabbing all the dragon spells to see if it does anything specific
[5:19:08] <joodatious> the final boss of elden ring is a twink
[5:19:10] <joodatious> fact
[5:19:17] <+LandOfTheWay> @QueequegTheater oh, well, to be fair that's basically a requirement for being a ruler in this setting, but yeah i get you
[5:19:24] <%Brassnarwhal> @darce_avidson i wasn't disagreeing i was just adding a bit i learned about dragons today
[5:19:30] <+swesterly> the duel nature of radagon/marika is super confusing too
[5:19:43] <darce_avidson> Can't wait for Miquella to be the DLC superboss and be one of the less then a handful of enemies that uses sleep
[5:19:49] <zenith0111> How buggy is dragon communion? It keeps saying "new powers unlocked" but I still get nothing
[5:19:57] <darce_avidson> like I think there are three in the game?
[5:20:00] <jubejube56> There is dialogue I learned that Melina can say in the queens bedchamber
[5:20:09] <jubejube56> Makes it sound almost like radagon took over the queen
[5:20:13] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @zenith0111 The new ones are only at the Caelid church.
[5:20:13] <%Brassnarwhal> @zenith0111 are you at the right church?
[5:20:14] <+swesterly> like they were split had kids, marika rebelled when confronted with death after godwyn died thanks to ranni, then the greater will bound them again
[5:20:15] <%EldritchBee> Yeah I have no idea what Sleep is or does
[5:20:15] <+Edrem> @zenith0111 there is more then 1 dragon communion vendor
[5:20:18] <darce_avidson> @zenith0111 are you going to the cathedral, or the church at night?
[5:20:26] <sirrice77> @zenith0111 are you looking in the church or the cathedral? the cathedral has the new powers not the one in limgrave
[5:20:32] <jubejube56> Idk if they were always the same person or if radagon pulled some bs to merge with her
[5:20:32] <+LandOfTheWay> the marika/radagon thing is mostly confusing just by virtue of how little we have to go on
[5:20:58] <%Brassnarwhal> @eldritchbee it's all in the name really
[5:21:00] <NewWillinium> @swesterly I don't think he died because of Ranni though. Ranni gave the Assassins to Rykard as some kind of last resort I . . .think?
[5:21:06] <jubejube56> Plus radagon was an outsider at first so idk how that would work
[5:21:07] <darce_avidson> There are lore trinkets that mention that Radagon always felt "imcomplete"
[5:21:07] <+typicalTablesalt> how was dinner
[5:21:11] <+Grayhammatter> da boi
[5:21:15] <%abakkus> psaDogchamp
[5:21:19] <rosabellamelantha> the baby
[5:21:19] <darce_avidson> so whether that was literal or figurative is up in the air
[5:21:23] <zenith0111> NotLikeThis I just assumed there was one
[5:21:24] <sweatch0> YEAAAH GET HIM
[5:21:27] <%EldritchBee> There'
[5:21:28] <%AKW4RD_BUFF4LO> Hope dinner was good!
[5:21:31] <RyuuAoi> How was dinner?
[5:21:32] <%baka_sugoi> psaDogchamp F OO B
[5:21:33] <sweatch0> OOOOH
[5:21:37] <+LandOfTheWay> my interpretation is that marika splintered herself into radagon in order to pacify the carian spellcasters, but eventually radagon and marika came to different opinions on the Golden Order
[5:21:42] <+swesterly> @darce_avidson that's because he was a duality split from marika
[5:21:46] <RyuuAoi> Awwwe the baby!
[5:21:54] <joodatious> tbh i feel like Elden Rings lore might be better constructed then Dark Souls. it seems a bit more tangible
[5:21:56] <%Agami23> considering the food paige has shown off before, its no wonder dinner was amazing.
[5:21:58] <TwistParabola> baby
[5:22:00] <+swesterly> @LandOfTheWay this checks out
[5:22:07] <+teddyz_ow> baby
[5:22:10] <%Brassnarwhal> @darce_avidson yesterday someone said she split him off from her so that would make him "incomplete" in a way, idk how true that is though it could be psa1guy
[5:22:13] <%EldritchBee> *there's a concept in Alchemy of the Rebis, a perfect being hermaphrodite made of a Red king and White queen, there's also the Lunar Princess in alchemy
[5:22:21] <majindusto> FOREVER  BABY
[5:22:22] <RyuuAoi> LUL
[5:22:30] <%BonewheelVanguard> Is the Queen of Rot joining us today?
[5:22:37] <+Romuken> Yo Pat, I'm doing a mostly INT build and I'm being showed the error of my ways in Raya Lucaria.
[5:22:45] <%luftraumm1> so what has pat done since the liturgical town?
[5:22:48] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> You can also craft it
[5:22:49] <+ChaosedStar> how was din din
[5:22:51] <+swesterly> @EldritchBee hermaphroditic demigods are recurring in many myths, real proto-psychological beast with two back shit
[5:22:52] <%notsoy> i know paige is frail, but rot? that's a bit rude
[5:22:53] <leole11> @BonewheelVanguard he has to do the entirety of haligtree, it's unlikely
[5:22:55] <%Brassnarwhal> @bonewheelvanguard you should be nicer to paige
[5:23:20] <joodatious> @EldritchBee gwyndolin is a trap case and point
[5:23:20] <+swesterly> paige as malenia fan art when
[5:23:28] <%Brassnarwhal> @bonewheelvanguard i meant that as a joke i realized with no punctuation or emotes it might not read as such
[5:23:33] <sjcodan> KILL HIM AND TAKE HIS BELL BEARING
[5:23:36] <%Agami23> my super good laser beam did no damage to phase 2 renala. but throwing rocks did big number
[5:23:44] <zenith0111> Yeah that was summon you couldve started with instead of buying btw
[5:23:55] <%notsoy> obviously, her fake arm is all bones
[5:23:57] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt you can also craft a item that makes enemies fight each other
[5:23:59] <RyuuAoi> Maybe Halloween
[5:23:59] <%abakkus> caelid except instead of scarlet rot it's just mustard
[5:24:12] <%BonewheelVanguard> @Brassnarwhal took it as joke my dude, no worries
[5:24:14] <+swesterly> not good enough
[5:24:15] <sjcodan> Man, FUCK Scrot
[5:24:15] <RyuuAoi> True
[5:24:18] <%Agami23> the only difference is the chin
[5:24:21] <peachy996> Who's Maelonia?
[5:24:21] <%Brassnarwhal> what if she's actually a skeleton and her meat suit is melting
[5:24:26] <majindusto> IS IT WRONG  THO?
[5:24:28] <%Monkeyweed21> just photoshop yellow mustard stains on Malenia
[5:24:28] <+swesterly> pat as mohg fan art when
[5:24:31] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> And they are both busted
[5:24:34] <joodatious> Scarlet Rot is just Lupus
[5:24:36] <%luftraumm1> so what has this area been like i missed the exploration
[5:24:37] <sjcodan> BLIND
[5:24:37] <digaogrunge> and she has the rot
[5:24:38] <+theoldone001> Fuck Malenia, literally and figuratively
[5:24:42] <Parapattern> Gold red lady who is BIG and STRONG
[5:24:45] <zenith0111> Kill the other imps too. The idea is that youre replacing the imps with your own
[5:24:50] <%Brassnarwhal> @bonewheelvanguard just gotta be careful, over in woolies chat i coulda got a death sentence for being misunderstood
[5:24:59] <joodatious> Pat has more of a Dung Eater vibe
[5:25:04] <+Grayhammatter> you... did it
[5:25:07] <+Edrem> wow, thought only way was with bewitching item
[5:25:08] <%Aeoneth> Not how I solved that puzzle but hey it worked
[5:25:10] <+swesterly> ooh weird i solved this puzzle another way
[5:25:16] <sjcodan> Pat is 100% Dung Eater
[5:25:26] <%Agami23> no, thats totally the sollution
[5:25:27] <oda_flobunaga> He may get to Malenia today.  However I doubt he will beat her today
[5:25:29] <%Aeoneth> I used a bewitching branch on one of the gargoyles and had it kill the other one
[5:25:29] <+swesterly> you can use an item that aggros enemies against one another
[5:25:31] <+Edrem> bewitching branch is a charm item you use on them
[5:25:32] <%Brassnarwhal> how does this puzzle have multiple solutions
[5:25:35] <%Agami23> that or a bewitching branch
[5:25:35] <zenith0111> Is it just summoning?
[5:25:37] <digaogrunge> You make them fight
[5:25:37] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt you use an item to make the imps fight each other
[5:25:37] <+swesterly> and make the imps kill each other
[5:25:40] <Saturation_Lizard> thats absolutely the way you do it
[5:25:43] <MoustacheCEO> Reminder Dung Eater did nothing wrong
[5:25:44] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt crystal darts make constructs attack each other
[5:25:49] <rosabellamelantha> yes
[5:25:54] <zenith0111> Ooooh
[5:25:54] <rosabellamelantha> there's not much here
[5:25:55] <sjcodan> Hahaha
[5:25:56] <%Brassnarwhal> that's so cool
[5:25:58] <%Valdorick> Did you fight the Night Cav?
[5:25:58] <NewWillinium> Y'all. The Wild Strikes Weapon Skill is the dumbest funnest thing.  It's just "I'm going to keep walking forward swinging. If you get hit it's your own fault"
[5:25:59] <+theoldone001> I'm stuck on Malenia right now, she literally has attacks that you cannot block
[5:25:59] <Sigma_190_Beta> Pretty much.
[5:25:59] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> Missing an dungeon
[5:26:00] <TwistParabola> uhhh
[5:26:01] <sirrice77> did you kill the death rite bird?
[5:26:03] <%pinkslimegoblin> you forgot the river boss
[5:26:03] <+swesterly> for the most part
[5:26:05] <%MaybeFalco> there's a catacombs
[5:26:05] <%EldritchBee> Yeah there's not much in the area
[5:26:07] <@QueequegTheater> BUT THE SCRIMBLO
[5:26:07] <TwistParabola> well there's a dungeon over there on the east side
[5:26:08] <Namillus> Turns out there's multiple ways to solve the puzzle! which is neat
[5:26:08] <+Edrem> there is a guy along the light path that is a hidden mimic bear
[5:26:09] <%SveriSageAdvice> there's a faith sword you're gonna want to look at later at least lol
[5:26:11] <oda_flobunaga> Its pretty ......
[5:26:13] <oda_flobunaga> UGLY
[5:26:14] <Augus7717> no not completely
[5:26:17] <sjcodan> You've missed a lot

[5:26:19] <%EldritchBee> JUST GO TO THE HALIGTREE
[5:26:20] <ape_hawk> you forgot to sacrifice grumblo on this one specific patch of snow
[5:26:21] <zenith0111> @namillus Huh weird
[5:26:22] <+Huderga> go to tree
[5:26:22] <peachy996> It never stops
[5:26:23] <%Brassnarwhal> @newwillinium use it with bleed?
[5:26:27] <MartyFun11> In the river
[5:26:27] <%SveriSageAdvice> that circlular alcove
[5:26:28] <%whyskeywolfe> There's a boss at the mouth of the river and a cave right beside it.
[5:26:28] <%Valdorick> Uh, 2 down
[5:26:29] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @NewWillinium Wild Strikes is comical on the healing Greataxe.
[5:26:36] <leole11> @theoldone001 you can dodge everything but the first burst, good luck
[5:26:36] <Augus7717> at the end of the river @PatStaresAt
[5:26:37] <%strakillias> Ever get those supposed Night's Cavalry?
[5:26:37] <TwistParabola> around the southeast side
[5:26:37] <%radiorosewater> scrimblo
[5:26:37] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt there is a dungeon on the river in the east but DO TREE
[5:26:38] <peachy996> You will never finish this game
[5:26:39] <%SveriSageAdvice> that one
[5:26:41] <%Valdorick> That one, yeah
[5:26:41] <%NBUsagi> Dont forget the scrumpus
[5:26:44] <%MaybeFalco> yes
[5:26:47] <%whyskeywolfe> Ye
[5:26:48] <%SveriSageAdvice> and at end of river ye

[5:26:52] <TwistParabola> think so yes
[5:26:53] <+Nomenanza> oh yeah there is stuff there too
[5:26:55] <zenith0111> So either use a super hyper rare item or use a summon wtf lol
[5:26:56] <TwistParabola> around there
[5:26:58] <%EldritchBee> RUINED RUINED RUINED
[5:26:59] <blue8moon> treeeeeeeeee
[5:27:01] <%Brassnarwhal> i had been avoiding capital cause I didn't want to get into the endgame, i massively underestimated this game
[5:27:08] <sjcodan> YOOOOOOOU
[5:27:10] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> There is a night boss there too
[5:27:10] <+swesterly> you did death bird before sol
[5:27:11] <%radiorosewater> flungo not seeded
[5:27:11] <TwistParabola> anyway BONUS ZONE TIME
[5:27:12] <+swesterly> ?
[5:27:14] <joodatious> does pat have all 3 scrimbus fetuses? he wont get the real ending otherwise
[5:27:19] <%pinkslimegoblin> goblins got you?
[5:27:28] <%radiorosewater> birds should follow
[5:27:32] <zenith0111> DO THE CAPITOL COWARD
[5:27:36] <joodatious> lol you thought!?
[5:27:37] <SIydoc> yes the "end" game
[5:27:38] <+swesterly> that's not real
[5:27:45] <joodatious> did you eat them?
[5:27:45] <%Agami23> did you get the dragonmaw miracle?'
[5:27:46] <sjcodan> Unironically did he find the umbilical cords?
[5:27:48] <wolfen091> did ya do the scrimblo bimblo stuff?
[5:27:49] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> did you feed at least 15 rice to the star- child?
[5:27:49] <senfood> You get to the endgame and realize you're only 60% done.
[5:27:51] <%BonewheelVanguard> turns out the capital is the half way point
[5:27:52] <%EldritchBee> Pat doesn't have the Sungnus Funguli, LP RUINED
[5:27:55] <TwistParabola> that's bloodborne
[5:27:55] <leole11> what about the secret scrimblo bimblo boss fight
[5:27:58] <%luftraumm1> but then there was a WHOLE other game after it
[5:27:58] <joodatious> if you dont eat them at midnight you dont get any endings
[5:28:02] <%dekkitout> The snake scrimbus? Was that an actual question or someone joshing?
[5:28:02] <ape_hawk> did you eat three of dlumpro's placentas?
[5:28:10] <sirrice77> did you get the petrified conjoined dragon twins?
[5:28:11] <%pinkslimegoblin> is there a crab boss in this game?
[5:28:13] <%EldritchBee> Oh shit its the Infraorder of Brachyura
[5:28:14] <NewWillinium> Isn't the Capital always the Half-way point?
[5:28:17] <+swesterly> the capital really is the halfway
[5:28:17] <@QueequegTheater> woolieCRAB
[5:28:24] <%Brassnarwhal> @dekkitout if scrim is in the name it's a bit
[5:28:24] <a_mad_dragon_> all the crabs are boss
[5:28:26] <NewWillinium> Like it was that way in DS and DS II as well
[5:28:26] <Macguffn> Crab reminds me of zangief
[5:28:28] <%NBUsagi> Snow crab
[5:28:29] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> that crab is the key to the final ending
[5:28:34] <MoustacheCEO> Did D die in this playthrough? He can't get the TRUE ending
[5:28:35] <%whyskeywolfe> Good crab.
[5:28:36] <it_came_from_outer_space> Is there ANY zone in this game without any crabs?????
[5:28:36] <%baka_sugoi> CRAB BATTLE
[5:28:37] <TheSandmanIsHere> needs more butter
[5:28:42] <SIydoc> has pat done the sewers yet?
[5:28:44] <%Felhad> He doesn't even use the Scrimbloblade of Blimblos, of course the LP is ruined
[5:28:48] <%EldritchBee> @MoustacheCEO D is DDead
[5:28:50] <@Fuggins4U> mmm crabohydrates
[5:28:53] <%Brassnarwhal> @it_came_from_outer_space *NO*
[5:28:53] <joodatious> @it_came_from_outer_space there better not be
[5:28:59] <casualbaloth> oh, this one is named
[5:29:00] <sjcodan> Hmmm yes bird.
[5:29:00] <senfood> Ha. His name it "Theodore."
[5:29:01] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt this is the final Wyrm
[5:29:12] <%MaybeFalco> VERY BIG WOW
[5:29:15] <%dekkitout> Teddy the Wyrm
[5:29:15] <sjcodan> TRY BLOCKING
[5:29:17] <sjcodan> 5head
[5:29:20] <peachy996> Theodorix ha what a nerd
[5:29:24] <TheSandmanIsHere> @senfood were the first two Alvin and Simon?
[5:29:26] <badhaye> Well shit now I gotta go back and fight this thing
[5:29:27] <%Brassnarwhal> i bet he u locks a new dragon spell, he has a name
[5:29:39] <+swesterly> be very careful in final boss arena, messages are on the ground and endings are chosen via summons signs with no confirmation prompt
[5:29:43] <%whyskeywolfe> "What if I just never shut my mouth?"
[5:29:45] <joodatious> ohh you probably right
[5:29:48] <wolfen091> big wyrm
[5:29:49] <RyuuAoi> GG, Teddy
[5:29:50] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> thats a lot of souls
[5:29:51] <Sigma_190_Beta> @PatStaresAt Maybe equip Godrick's rune again?
[5:29:53] <rosabellamelantha> anytime
[5:29:53] <DuckAlfred> big salamnder man
[5:29:53] <senfood> @TheSandmanIsHere They are now.
[5:29:57] <+Kalentan> whenever
[5:29:57] <%Brassnarwhal> that tigrex walk is so annoying
[5:30:00] <%whyskeywolfe> He's a whenever boss
[5:30:00] <NewWillinium> Naw I think he's a whenever bos
[5:30:03] <oda_flobunaga> Its normal boss
[5:30:10] <MoustacheCEO> @swesterly That got me my first run but it was the one I wanted so it was fine
[5:30:11] <%bigbrothergannon> become giant
[5:30:12] <sjcodan> I think your current rune is kinda useless for normal play?
[5:30:15] <Macguffn> If that's Theodorix, where are Alvinoth and Simonal?
[5:30:18] <%MaybeFalco> its a scrimblo only boss
[5:30:21] <TwistParabola> there IS still a dungeon near there
[5:30:38] <sjcodan> THATS LIKE NOT POPPING HUMANITY
[5:30:38] <+swesterly> @swesterly it got me too but and it didn't give me the ending i wanted but it ended up being the coolest one imo so i didn't feel cheated
[5:30:40] <Sigma_190_Beta> @PatStaresAt Godrick's still gives you a bonus to your stats.
[5:30:44] <RustyQuarters> He HATES rune marks
[5:30:46] <sjcodan> He's fuckin crazy
[5:30:48] <+Kalentan> Yeah... Rune Arcs are good but bad to rely on them, you'll go through them like candy.
[5:30:51] <%EldritchBee> RED CRAB RED CRAB RED CRAB
[5:30:54] <leole11> no idea why you don't just pop rune arcs, i played 90% of the game with them on
[5:30:58] <%Brassnarwhal> @sjcodan I didn't use humanity for 99 percent of ds1
[5:31:01] <%Agami23> i wish rune arcs worked like embers in ds3 where you get the rune powered by beating bosses
[5:31:05] <joodatious> Runes are pretty useful since they only go away on death
[5:31:05] <+cowkid222> I'm bashing my head against black blade kindred chat, and tips? in level 62, thinking just come back a bit later
[5:31:08] <%EldritchBee> Red crab missed LP ruined
[5:31:15] <%RealThiele> oh shit gotta uturn for that
[5:31:16] <@Fuggins4U> its true, i did
[5:31:19] <it_came_from_outer_space> it was me
[5:31:21] <%boggsz12> anypme else encounter a bug in the divine towers where the top is filled with fucking blinding lights?
[5:31:28] <+Grayhammatter> yeah this is just monster hunter
[5:31:37] <%dekkitout> You got me, I played monster hunter
[5:31:41] <SIydoc> i wish having a rune active opened you up to invasions even while solo
[5:31:48] <+Nomenanza> oh no I hate tigrex
[5:31:52] <sirrice77> @cowkid222 he's like lategame level so come back later
[5:31:58] <%sebbbbb> have you named your mimic tear yet pat
[5:31:59] <%MaybeFalco> @boggsz12 no but that sounds hilarious for some reason
[5:32:00] <@Fuggins4U> Tigrex Garag
[5:32:01] <+swesterly> pat you have to hit him
[5:32:06] <%BonewheelVanguard> The Gore Magala be looking different
[5:32:07] <joodatious> @SIydoc ewww why would you want that?
[5:32:07] <%RealThiele> dats a lot of HP
[5:32:10] <%luftraumm1> that's a lot of helath
[5:32:11] <joodatious> invasions suck
[5:32:12] <zenith0111> Tigrex would take this fool easily tho
[5:32:12] <Namillus> @SIydoc You want Humanity/Embers back?
[5:32:14] <+Grayhammatter> tigrex with a sword
[5:32:19] <sjcodan> WHAT
[5:32:20] <%Brassnarwhal> rune arc is a consumable why use consumable now when i can save consumable for later, it's a very simple concept
[5:32:22] <it_came_from_outer_space> LMAO

[5:33:39] <@Fuggins4U> now you're a magma dragoon
[5:33:39] <%Brassnarwhal> very cool
[5:33:43] <%Fenrisulfr_V> That just said Theodorix was a troll before he became a Wyrm.
[5:33:46] <it_came_from_outer_space> magmuh
[5:33:52] <+Grayhammatter> whoa
[5:33:56] <rosabellamelantha> @Aussie_Manny Wyverns in this setting are people who ate a TON of dragons like pat but gave into their dragon hunger
[5:33:59] <%baka_sugoi> L A V A

[5:34:23] <sjcodan> OTHER end of the river has boss too
[5:34:24] <%Brassnarwhal> i got that from killing the one on gelmir
[5:34:29] <Aussie_Manny> Doesn't go too far, but I bet it hurts a lot of enemies A LOT
[5:34:38] <%shootbang_exe> night boss though
[5:34:48] <%Taisuru> So do the dragon attacks scale off faith?
[5:34:48] <+swesterly> haligtree is probably about the size of the ringed city
[5:34:49] <sjcodan> Yeah night boss bird
[5:34:58] <%Brassnarwhal> @aussie_manny it doesn't do as much damage as the boss' does
[5:35:05] <joodatious> Haligtree is an absurdly pretty area
[5:35:08] <%RealThiele> so pat cleared the mine here already?
[5:35:13] <%luftraumm1> did you know that you can start the heavy attack on horseback and jump after?
[5:35:26] <%Brassnarwhal> @taisuru i honestly can't tell if they scale cause their raw damage is so high
[5:35:29] <@Fuggins4U> nani
[5:35:31] <joodatious> WOH thats so cool!

[5:39:15] <Sigma_190_Beta> You missed.
[5:39:15] <sendart> short range
[5:39:16] <morkelebmink> it might be immune

[5:39:31] <+TheBitingIrish> It's honestly very weak
[5:39:33] <majindusto> THAT'S  A BIRD? cmonBruh
[5:39:34] <Saturation_Lizard> you missed, the death bird has a weird hitbox
[5:39:35] <TheSandmanIsHere> note that it was taking damage as it stood in the lava
[5:39:36] <Zourath> Remember how weak magma was against you?
[5:39:38] <zenith0111> Youre in a ice biome so fire spells are nerfed right?
[5:39:41] <%RealThiele> magma range is like pointblank and was ticking for like 100?
[5:39:43] <%tetraes> at niht
[5:39:51] <+DrFacilier> The Death Rite Bird is a species i wouldnt mind going extinct
[5:39:52] <digaogrunge> Its daytime Pat
[5:40:09] <%Fenrisulfr_V> I really wish dying didn't pass time. Makes night bosses very annoying.
[5:40:11] <%Brassnarwhal> i use the lava to punish stationary enemies it's pretty bad if they move a lot, deatbird is pretty mobile
[5:40:15] <TwistParabola> LUL

[5:41:05] <%RealThiele> well from what ive seen only special bosses at night so daytime seems like a waste
[5:41:10] <TwistParabola> because it's in a later zone
[5:41:11] <@Fuggins4U> @Fenrisulfr_V also i imagine it lets you gets your souls back if it's a boss you cant beat yet
[5:41:11] <%Fenrisulfr_V> It's covered in Deathfire.
[5:41:15] <SinisterBroccoli> just wait for his absolute bullshit atytack
[5:41:16] <@goose_attack_almanac> It's got an extra four letters, thus making it more powerful
[5:41:18] <halfmasks> BIRDS AINT SHIT
[5:41:20] <joodatious> its really cool to play through certain areas at different times of day.
[5:41:23] <%Pookiedaexzile> Tweetie flexing
[5:41:25] <+croutonian> tweety bird lookin ass
[5:41:25] <%Brassnarwhal> the aoe is the big thing and deathbird isn't gonna stand in it

[5:41:35] <majindusto> That is one UGLY  Bird
[5:41:39] <Therusher> @luftraumm1 pretty sure they explicitly say that in the intro cinematic
[5:41:39] <%Brassnarwhal> squeeze him good pat
[5:41:41] <joodatious> its very pretty on the boss fight area
[5:41:42] <%RealThiele> oh he didnt kill death bird in caelid then
[5:41:49] <%Brassnarwhal> really wring that piss out
[5:41:52] <%Fenrisulfr_V> OH CHRIST, a skunk just sprayed the wall outside my AC unit. I'm gonna throw up.
[5:41:52] <+RedMaskBandit> yeah fighting Radahn at night was beautiful
[5:42:18] <%RealThiele> Spray the skunk back assert dominance
[5:42:18] <+rbakervv> i bet that after he gets back from taking the dog out, he will play for like 10 minutes, then have to stop and go to the bathroom
[5:42:20] <%abakkus> @fenrisulfr_v waynerF
[5:42:28] <%Felhad> @fenrisulfr_v RIP

[5:42:52] <%radiorosewater> @Fenrisulfr_V good luck homie
[5:43:00] <%Brassnarwhal> if you kill the skunk boss you get the spray ash of war
[5:43:03] <%Fenrisulfr_V> This is what I get for living somewhere rural lol
[5:43:21] <majindusto> Skunks are Assholes
[5:43:47] <%Brassnarwhal> @majindusto i hear they're pretty cool if they don't think you're gonna eat them
[5:44:09] <%RealThiele> Skunk thought the AC was gonna eat it so spraaaaay
[5:44:18] <%abakkus> simply do not inhale mirakuruQuan
[5:44:19] <%soloshotfirst82> @Fenrisulfr_V I live downtown in a suburb and the same thing happened to me last summer.  Skunks give 0 fucks.
[5:44:36] <joodatious> you are now breathing manually
[5:44:44] <RubberFistFight> @Fenrisulfr_V now you gotta wash the wall with gazpacho soup loloololol
[5:44:47] <majindusto> Don't  Breathe...GOT IT
[5:44:48] <%Brassnarwhal> the issue is that their only weapon is a nuclear option so it's always kinda sketch to have them around
[5:45:17] <%Brassnarwhal> @joodatious jokes on you you're tongue isn't sitting comfortably in your mouth anymore
[5:45:20] <%RealThiele> return the skunk to caelid where it belongs
[5:45:25] <%Brassnarwhal> your
[5:45:57] <%abakkus> just talking bout skunks
[5:46:00] <%soloshotfirst82> I used to have a huge skunk living in an old burrow in my backyard that had a summer-long turfwar with a groundhog family.  At least once a week I'd hear ungodly screaming and horrible smells at like 3 in the morning.
[5:46:04] <%Brassnarwhal> @realthiele don't send the skunk to caelid, you saw what it did to dogs and crows, do you REALLY want a caelid giant rot skunk?
[5:46:15] <%baka_sugoi> DANK
[5:46:20] <%RealThiele> giant rot skunk sounds like a miyazaki enemy
[5:46:21] <RustyQuarters> cuz you smell haha gottem
[5:46:23] <RustyQuarters> Kappa
[5:46:23] <joodatious> @PatStaresAt I watched that newer suicide squad movie last night and was really mad when they perpetuated the myth that rats can swim..
[5:46:28] <Nordguy> they're cool
[5:46:29] <joodatious> i hate hollywood
[5:46:31] <BreakfastSampler> Anyone know how to disable the loading screen tips?
[5:46:31] <Augus7717> Skunk deez nuts @PatStaresAt

[5:46:39] <%Brassnarwhal> @fenrisulfr_v had a skunk spray their ac unit
[5:46:40] <%Monkeyweed21> cuz skunks are adorable but smelly like gief
[5:46:41] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @PatStaresAt The wall with my AC unit in it got sprayed by a skunk and blew skunk gas straight into the unit.
[5:46:44] <%sniffy77> plz tarnished. if you summon me to help fight radahn, DONT GET UP IN HIS FACE THAT'S MY JOB
[5:46:51] <%abakkus> poor dude in chat had a skunk spray on his ac intake 🙏 RIP to a real one
[5:46:53] <TheSandmanIsHere> probably don't want that AC unit on unless absolutely necessary, otherwise it'll just pipe the stank through your house
[5:46:54] <+CherteuseKapibara> no friends for birds
[5:47:06] <+LandOfTheWay> oh that's fucking rough
[5:47:08] <%RealThiele> Torrent only friend needed
[5:47:16] <digaogrunge> oof, thas rough bud
[5:47:25] <%Fenrisulfr_V> Man, deathfire in this game is sick.
[5:47:37] <%Fenrisulfr_V> Freezing flames are such a neat idea.
[5:47:39] <%Brassnarwhal> @sniffy77 i feel that way about when they take agro from me on the fat apostle's roll attack, like do you not see the barricaded greatshield in my hand?
[5:47:39] <sjcodan> You have to hit them ,woolie
[5:47:43] <some_brave_apollo> he's a tough 1

[5:48:08] <badhaye> AOE spell
[5:48:12] <%Monkeyweed21> necromancy shit
[5:48:13] <%RealThiele> Torrent jousting is how i kill those
[5:48:14] <TheSandmanIsHere> summon the archer lady off to the side where she's safe
[5:48:17] <%Brassnarwhal> he's a death RITE bird not a deathbird @patstaresat
[5:48:28] <%Willowight> gives you a hard time
[5:48:28] <%furiousfurioso> this part of the game is when I took off those talismans that increase the damage you take and put on ones that up your defense and never looked back
[5:48:30] <%TheAdMerlin> Sense of pride and accomplishment?
[5:48:33] <mellshone> He gives you a big dick
[5:48:52] <%RealThiele> great outfit here
[5:48:54] <%radiorosewater> should birds follow? science
[5:48:56] <%luftraumm1> so you solved this place then
[5:49:06] <joodatious> a tree dummy
[5:49:07] <%MrMegaJackpots> helligtree
[5:49:11] <ape_hawk> i dunno, whats the haligtree with you?
[5:49:14] <%Monkeyweed21> its a tree that Haligs
[5:49:16] <+Grayhammatter> it's a tree
[5:49:16] <%MaybeFalco> its a scrimblo bambooni
[5:49:18] <%TINMANxHMx> I nuked him a few times with Rannis dark moon spell, but it took several tries
[5:49:21] <%shootbang_exe> halitosistree
[5:49:23] <Augus7717> its a tree :)
[5:49:24] <%RealThiele> Haligma balls
[5:49:34] <%Brassnarwhal> @monkeyweed21 haligma balls
[5:49:36] <TwistParabola> :)
[5:49:36] <badhaye> Time to find out
[5:49:42] <Sunstalker> Something holy? The holy arrows get called that? There's Golden arrows and haligbone arrows which are ones dipped in golden excrement.
[5:49:43] <TwistParabola> IT'S TIME
[5:49:43] <%TINMANxHMx> I figured the Halig tree was like an artificial erd tree
[5:49:46] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> good luck!
[5:49:47] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt this next zone is the size of the entire ringed city dlc

[5:50:00] <+AyupaPupa> fun tree time
[5:50:02] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @PatStaresAt The armor set of one of the gemeric enemies in the Haligtree explains it. It was an Erdtree sapling being fed directly by Miquella's blood.
[5:50:04] <zenith0111> Its especially weird when you read the descriptions implying the Elder Tree is relatively new
[5:50:04] <%MrMegaJackpots> it's a fake erdtree
[5:50:05] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> DOOT pt 2
[5:50:07] <%RealThiele> its ok i dont mind shared jokes

[5:50:29] <RustyQuarters> Great Value brand capital
[5:50:31] <%Brassnarwhal> they refer to it as hers a few times offhandedly and in descriptions
[5:50:31] <NewWillinium> I think it was the Capital of the two Twins.
[5:50:32] <sirrice77> i hope you like the doot squad
[5:50:33] <+Grayhammatter> this seems like hell

[5:50:46] <%TINMANxHMx> this is the zone that belongs to that dude in the cacoon
[5:50:48] <%RealThiele> tree seems kinda fungus-y
[5:50:52] <Augus7717> or used to at least
[5:50:53] <jubejube56> Wait was that a different effect for grace?
[5:50:59] <halfmasks> its the doot doot tree
[5:51:05] <%TINMANxHMx> satan kidnapped the dude

[5:52:03] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt I mean it was stated before that Miquella was meant to be the new god, Malenia was just the consort/godfrey stand in
[5:52:07] <youngin_______420> what are youuuuu?! cool!
[5:52:07] <sjcodan> POOP-TOOT
[5:52:09] <+anoldtoilet> this looks a lot more natural and alive than the erd tree
[5:52:13] <+GammaSan55> @alphonseisbest nope
[5:52:15] <Evendrag> holy tree id imagine
[5:52:15] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> DO NOT DOOT
[5:52:19] <%sniffy77> ...aliens?
[5:52:21] <jubejube56> From what I understand Miquella was the brain and Malenia was the brawn

[5:52:29] <Sunstalker> Man, this place seems like the spot to pull out the greatbows and just knock off every pest
[5:52:29] <+alphonseisbest> @gammasan55 ty

[5:52:46] <RustyQuarters> Yeah a real giant fuck off tree would have all sorts of crazy shit growing off of it
[5:52:48] <%EldritchBee> You can't get the Tuba AFAIK
[5:52:48] <Ethel9727> Malenia and Miquella seem like close, like GRRM sibling close
[5:52:48] <zenith0111> @tinmanxhmx This is all technically a big "secret zone" thats unlocked after you get access to the whole map so its recc lvl is probably absurd
[5:52:50] <%Brassnarwhal> @eldritchbee yaaaas
[5:52:55] <halfmasks> O, Gravity
[5:52:56] <kingra> OOF
[5:52:56] <oda_flobunaga> Halig means Holy in Old English
[5:53:00] <digaogrunge> Im impressed with Froms restrain here... where are the archers? Why dont all these guys have WoG prepared?
[5:53:01] <sjcodan> Didn't expect gravity
[5:53:04] <ohno58> I like you how you immediately knew you fucked up as soon as you jumped
[5:53:07] <%Felhad> jumping off ahead
[5:53:14] <rosabellamelantha> @Ethel9727 there are statues of them being **very** close
[5:53:16] <%whyskeywolfe> Hold onto that feeling.
[5:53:22] <ape_hawk> its a tree
[5:53:24] <%MrMegaJackpots> trees are nature
[5:53:26] <ape_hawk> thats really fucking big
[5:53:26] <sjcodan> It IS nature, good job pat
[5:53:32] <%luftraumm1> my beloved seems apropriate
[5:53:32] <%Felhad> its the Haligtree
[5:53:33] <%RealThiele> DS1 Tree maze
[5:53:35] <RubberFistFight> it's a thing called a "tree'. it's made of wood, it's got leaves on it, and it grows in nature.
[5:53:35] <%Pookiedaexzile> DOOT
[5:53:38] <+anoldtoilet> lol these enemies are so weird
[5:53:38] <%Felhad> its Miquella's
[5:53:38] <some_brave_apollo> Patron my beloved
[5:53:39] <NewWillinium> I think it was the City of the Twins. Like how Ranni and her Mother and the Lake and Academy
[5:53:40] <%Monkeyweed21> @zenith0111 Yea this is the optional endgame superboss zone for crazy people
[5:53:40] <%rumtumtugnutz> It's a tree
[5:53:41] <halfmasks> WELCOME TO TOUHOU MF
[5:53:41] <%sniffy77> pat its probably aliens
[5:53:41] <Wobuzhidao> The nature of this stand fight?
[5:53:44] <%justcallmebobplease> It's a Scarlet Rotted tree.
[5:53:45] <hellfirejefe> the great hollow 2
[5:53:45] <%baka_sugoi> ANT BIG
[5:53:46] <+anoldtoilet> this zone is really cool
[5:53:47] <Foopoof> Probably wood element or something
[5:53:48] <TwistParabola> you can easily get lost here
[5:53:49] <%TINMANxHMx> @zenith0111 really? I thought this was natural progression lol I just went here after completing the snowfields like I thought I was supposed to
[5:53:50] <%Brassnarwhal> @patstaresat the great hollow from ds1 got a psaBig glowup
[5:53:55] <sjcodan> Why rotted?
[5:53:57] <+GammaSan55> it's like groot without talking
[5:53:57] <Sunstalker> Are these levels the reason you can't R1 yourself off edges anymore?
[5:54:00] <sjcodan> I wonder
[5:54:02] <ohno58> It's ZUN's wet dream
[5:54:03] <%Felhad> Because Malenia
[5:54:05] <%furiousfurioso> I was able to get a good grasp on what this place is by the end
[5:54:10] <%soloshotfirst82> Is this karma for when Pat was yellin' about trees earlier?
[5:54:11] <%justcallmebobplease> Did Pat ever talk to Gowry AFTER giving Millicent the Prosthetic?
[5:54:12] <@Spydurman> maybe it's a dead Erdtree from the rot?
[5:54:16] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> i sure wasnt
[5:54:18] <%Brassnarwhal> i bet there will be basilisks here, it's the great hollow 2
[5:54:22] <sjcodan> Correct
[5:54:25] <+anoldtoilet> this looks more alive than the normal erdtree
[5:54:29] <SIydoc> well pretty much all of the demigods have their own place
[5:54:32] <+anoldtoilet> is this like, the real world tree and the erdtree is an alien
[5:54:32] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> i beat the game and have no clue
[5:54:35] <%Pookiedaexzile> Miyazaki getting his Miyazaki on with the forest Spirits
[5:54:36] <ape_hawk> are these godskin guys?
[5:54:42] <+LandOfTheWay> just keep an eye out for items and read their descriptions. it'll become clear enough
[5:54:46] <%Monkeyweed21> short answer is that Empyreans have some shit going on
[5:54:47] <%shootbang_exe> listen what even is an erd tree or a halig tree ok it's all big tree
[5:54:47] <%Brassnarwhal> @i_oneguy_over_heaven_i
[5:54:48] <SIydoc> they dont live with their parents pat
[5:54:49] <RustyQuarters> Tree but Blight Town Kappa
[5:54:52] <%luftraumm1> not godskin no
[5:54:57] <zenith0111> @tinmanxhmx No you have to actively switch action prompts on the elevator after find two hidden pieces at two ends of the map lol
[5:54:57] <%Brassnarwhal> oops sorry @i_oneguy_over_heaven_i
[5:55:02] <digaogrunge> Is scarlet rot just a fungal disease?  Can we get this tree some cream?
[5:55:02] <TwistParabola> Miquella just grew this.
[5:55:05] <sjcodan> JUMP
[5:55:07] <%abakkus> delighted by a fromsoft game where you actually get answers without having to do a PhD thesis deep dive on lore scraps
[5:55:07] <%sniffy77> DOOT
[5:55:08] <sjcodan> JUMP COWARD
[5:55:08] <Foopoof> Oh I can’t wait to see pat fight the last boss of this area
[5:55:14] <Talinu> Erdtree mean Earth Tree and Haligtree means Holy Tree.

[5:58:16] <%dekkitout> The Lands Adjacent?
[5:58:17] <it_came_from_outer_space> I like how obvious it is that the ants are from the real world due to    them looking less stylized than all other enemies basically
[5:58:20] <%RealThiele> Marika from the moon?
[5:58:21] <ape_hawk> maybe she came from Lands Betwixt?
[5:58:23] <TwistParabola> @some_brave_apollo i wouldnt put it past miyazaki or GRRM

[6:00:11] <%TINMANxHMx> I think its implied the rest of the world is more or less normal. bonfire-chan says something about it. But in the lands between, no one died or some shit. So it was special. The tarnished were booted out for being heretics because the tree didnt like them anymore. Or something like that.
[6:00:11] <boostergoldz> I got so burned out at this point I ran through this zone.
[6:00:13] <%Pookiedaexzile> YEYEYEYEYEEYYEYEYEYE

[6:00:14] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @PatStaresAt Random question. Why do you never quit out while falling, since it returns you to the last bit of safe ground you were on?
[6:00:16] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt just go down the other way
[6:00:16] <Sunstalker> Hey pat, you're faith. Could probbaly slap on the Force/God of Wrath incantations and yeet them off

[6:02:19] <sothatsprettybrutal> it is sort of funny, the necessity of making a workable game, even massive-ass elden ring, everything of importance is in like one metro area and there are 5 biomes and so on. the rest of the planet, irrelevant

[6:05:35] <%NBUsagi> I wonder why the Demihumans are worshipping Miquella
[6:05:37] <cavefishes> man guard counter looks fun af
[6:05:50] <ape_hawk> are those egg sacs?
[6:05:54] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @NBUsagi Misbegotten, not demihumans.
[6:05:58] <sjcodan> ALMOST
[6:05:59] <%Brassnarwhal> @cavefishes it's pretty good
[6:06:02] <%EldritchBee> @NBUsagi These are Misbegotten, not Demihumans
[6:06:07] <%EldritchBee> Demihumans are monkeys
[6:06:19] <SinisterBroccoli> That's racist
[6:06:21] <some_brave_apollo> what's the lore for misbegottens
[6:06:28] <RustyQuarters> TRUE
[6:06:33] <%luftraumm1> architecture looks valar
[6:06:34] <%EldritchBee> @some_brave_apollo They're misbegotten
[6:06:39] <wolfen091> the year was 19xx
[6:06:39] <%NBUsagi> @NBUsagi Misbegotten? like failed gods?
[6:06:41] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt I imagine since Mohg stole Miquella
[6:06:45] <some_brave_apollo> makes sense
[6:06:46] <NewWillinium> And used as slaves
[6:06:48] <SIydoc> misbegottens are normal people that were born fucked up and with horns
[6:06:49] <jacksawjack> I still think the Erd Tree is a Lavos
[6:06:51] <cavefishes> I have not used a shield in my whole 120 hours
[6:06:57] <ohno58> "where'd everbody g-FUCK"
[6:07:00] <+anoldtoilet> @SIydoc i thought those were Omens
[6:07:06] <Gimplock> 99% of all messages on the ground are just trolls =P
[6:07:10] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> yeah omens
[6:07:11] <+anoldtoilet> i think so as well jacksaw
[6:07:17] <sothatsprettybrutal> you can't solve all your problems by lavosing them
[6:07:18] <SinisterBroccoli> Is he giving that guy cpr?
[6:07:20] <+anoldtoilet> it seems like an alien colonizing the world or something
[6:07:23] <SIydoc> wait yea i think i just combined the two in my head
[6:07:25] <%EldritchBee> That's omens, misbegotten are their own thing
[6:07:26] <%luftraumm1> important bloodstain there
[6:07:28] <%Brassnarwhal> @some_brave_apollo Miss B. Got on deez nuts
[6:07:31] <Sunstalker> Pat, your fire sword not dealing more dmg here?
[6:07:36] <cavefishes> indeed they were
[6:07:45] <%sniffy77> tfw host dies to radahn at 5%hp :(
[6:07:47] <AlexJacobVO> Man... I can't get multiplayer to work in this at all... Can't invade. Can't co-op. Internet connection I know is stable. All settings are showing correct. Anyone got anything? Is it me? Is it the game? Is FromSoft doing a bad?
[6:07:47] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> the southernmost misbegotten were the castle slaves revolting
[6:07:48] <%EldritchBee> I think they're like. slave race, like the albinaurics
[6:07:49] <%RealThiele> i still think omens are just a product of godly incest
[6:07:51] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> but thats all i know
[6:08:00] <%Brassnarwhal> @sunstalker fire sword was so 20 hours ago
[6:08:01] <sjcodan> This is why you never put items away
[6:08:07] <sjcodan> YOU MIGHT NEED IT
[6:08:09] <some_brave_apollo> people in the lands between sure love slavery
[6:08:14] <+AyupaPupa> mushroom mushroom!
[6:08:20] <SIydoc> no morgott is godfrey and marikas kid though
[6:08:20] <rosabellamelantha> down is prog
[6:08:22] <%RealThiele> nom
[6:08:23] <%justcallmebobplease> The game says fuck you, go down.
[6:08:28] <Vermillion129> Oh pat is here, cool
[6:08:29] <%Brassnarwhal> @sjcodan you might need to reequip fast more
[6:08:32] <TwistParabola> LUL
[6:08:43] <doster504> @AlexJacobVO what level are you?
[6:08:46] <%Willowight> antidown
[6:08:47] <Sunstalker> Always up first. You started high and high always lets you see what the area is like
[6:08:54] <zenith0111> @realthiele Natural Births stopped a long time ago and its just one lady doing it apparently
[6:08:57] <%justcallmebobplease> Horse?
[6:09:00] <+Kalentan> yes.
[6:09:00] <%justcallmebobplease> Horse jump?
[6:09:02] <rosabellamelantha> Miquella child, Malenia Rot
[6:09:03] <%luftraumm1> thats where you were
[6:09:06] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> no horse here
[6:09:06] <wolfen091> shroom jump?
[6:09:08] <sjcodan> No horse
[6:09:12] <RustyQuarters> OOO
[6:09:14] <%EldritchBee> No Horse Ahead
[6:09:14] <AlexJacobVO> @doster504 78
[6:09:19] <jacksawjack> The Scarlot Trussy
[6:09:22] <%justcallmebobplease> Ah
[6:09:23] <peachy996> literally my waifu is 1000 year old vampire
[6:09:24] <+AyupaPupa> no horse but hole
[6:09:34] <%furiousfurioso> yea I couldn't figure out the point of that path either
[6:09:37] <TwistParabola> born with it
[6:09:38] <NewWillinium> Morgott was an Omen.
[6:09:45] <%pinkslimegoblin> is malenia the source of all of the rot? did she give it to radahn?
[6:09:46] <ohno58> they were incest babies and incest is bad
[6:09:49] <sjcodan> probably an invasion spawn
[6:09:54] <%EldritchBee> Morgott and Mohg are Omen Twins
[6:09:55] <jacksawjack> Hey some Jalapeno KY
[6:09:58] <%justcallmebobplease> They say Malenia's Rot, but I feel like that's a poor in-verse understanding of what Rot is - because Scarlet Rot sure does a lot of not-rot-related nonsense.
[6:09:58] <sjcodan> GOTTEM
[6:10:00] <cavefishes> malenia hardcore rotted up
[6:10:01] <pi_in_the_sci> The lore on the mushroom hat offers some insight on why Rot
[6:10:01] <knotsundownsyndrome> radahn doesn't suck
[6:10:01] <Sunstalker> LuL asshole message
[6:10:02] <%TheLemuroid> LUL
[6:10:04] <%Brassnarwhal> @ohno58 mmkay
[6:10:05] <+swesterly> an omen of what though
[6:10:05] <NewWillinium> Mohg is also an Omen.   Rykard. . . .Became a Snake
[6:10:07] <+LandOfTheWay> the kids are NOT alright
[6:10:08] <+MarkoTolstov> yes, the two curses: rotting and baby
[6:10:12] <SIydoc> morgott and mohg are twins and the younger brother of godwyn i believe
[6:10:15] <knotsundownsyndrome> radahn's the coolest of them all
[6:10:20] <boostergoldz> I like all the minor details that sell this as a rotting tree. like if you look at some of the branches there's some clear dieback.
[6:10:22] <%notsoy> the classic lying message lmao
[6:10:23] <zenith0111> Fuck them kids
[6:10:24] <TheSandmanIsHere> yeah, it's almost like there was something wrong about Marika and Radagon having children
[6:10:32] <+imthinkingdarbys> i'm shocked more messages aren't like that
[6:10:35] <knotsundownsyndrome> radahn named his horse leonard and learned gravity magic just to ride it
[6:10:42] <%luftraumm1> wait what the fuck is that statue??
[6:10:42] <%fanciful_fright> I think Malenia's interaction with the three fingers created scarlet rot? Not 100% sure, its vague.
[6:10:44] <+Funky_Honkey> slab get
[6:10:46] <AlexJacobVO> @doster504 lvl 78
[6:10:47] <TheSandmanIsHere> by the way, did Pat find the secret of Radagon's statue in the capital?
[6:10:51] <knotsundownsyndrome> i dunno about you but that's prime demigod material to me
[6:10:55] <+anoldtoilet> rot is probably isomething like the buddhist "kegare" knowing froms earlier takes on stagnation and rot
[6:10:57] <%LeiaSkynoober> @TheSandmanIsHere Yes!
[6:11:00] <boostergoldz> they really like that push trap.
[6:11:01] <sjcodan> Hush
[6:11:02] <+LandOfTheWay> that statue explains most of the lore of this place
[6:11:03] <RubberFistFight> @TheSandmanIsHere he did yeah
[6:11:03] <rosabellamelantha> @fanciful_fright No she had it from birth
[6:11:06] <%Brassnarwhal> @thesandmanishere yes
[6:11:07] <NewWillinium> Oh and then there was Godrick. Who us barely a Lord
[6:11:13] <zenith0111> Im still unsure of what the Greater Will is refering to
[6:11:16] <+alphonseisbest> @fanciful_fright cant be she had since she was born
[6:11:18] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt twincest is the lore
[6:11:27] <%Brassnarwhal> @newwillinium 3rd cousin to a lord
[6:11:28] <%NBUsagi> Its Milenia and Miquella
[6:11:31] <%luftraumm1> huh
[6:11:32] <knotsundownsyndrome> @anoldtoilet i think i know what the scarlet rot, but i have no idea if it's spoilers so i kinda wanna avoid saying it
[6:11:34] <TheSandmanIsHere> so he knows about the problem with Marika and Radagon having kids then
[6:11:38] <Sunstalker> This statue exists elswhere, right?
[6:11:39] <wolfen091> can't hug yo children with no arms
[6:11:41] <Ethel9727> Being like "We're twins written by GRRM."
[6:11:41] <NewWillinium> This was their city I think
[6:11:41] <knotsundownsyndrome> that be malenia holding miquella
[6:11:46] <Sunstalker> I've seen it before
[6:11:50] <TheSandmanIsHere> incest and narcissism all in one
[6:11:53] <jacksawjack> Well, considering Radagon was Marika and Radagon was the second King Consort that means Cartmans Mom was also his Dad\
[6:11:55] <%geekjacob> how was dinner pat
[6:12:17] <pi_in_the_sci> Stuff in the Rotten Lake suggests that rot predates the golden order, like it's an atavistic trait of this people
[6:12:25] <TwistParabola> LUL
[6:12:30] <+alphonseisbest> DONT FUCK YOURSELVES CHAT, SELFCEST IS STILL IN CEST
[6:12:30] <%Brassnarwhal> @jacksawjack so cartman is jesus? that sounds like immaculate conception
[6:12:31] <zenith0111> The plot twist is literally Ace Ventura
[6:12:32] <sjcodan> Turns out the only thing GRRM brought to the table was incest
[6:12:36] <%EldritchBee> Pat sayng Ugh before even seeing what the snails were summoning
[6:12:46] <TwistParabola> Great instinct
[6:12:46] <%Brassnarwhal> @alphonseisbest I'd fuck me
[6:12:52] <Vermillion129> LUL

[6:13:04] <%shootbang_exe> yeah this zone is wild
[6:13:06] <halfmasks> FOR REAL
[6:13:08] <+heyitsbrian> heyitsbrian subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 48 months! 
[6:13:08] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt You are no longer overlevelled
[6:13:08] <zaptar13> How big is this fucking tree? Surely there can't be that much more?
[6:13:09] <+swesterly> i hate those farquads
[6:13:11] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> this is a real fun place to invade
[6:13:12] <ape_hawk> alright, who let the snails into the godforsaken tree city??
[6:13:13] <cavefishes> this is a good fucker tree area i'm a genuine fan
[6:13:14] <ohno58> welcome to mushroom town motherfucker
[6:13:16] <rosabellamelantha> OOPS ALL INCEST
[6:13:16] <sjcodan> Hey man, as long as you don't have kds
[6:13:20] <it_came_from_outer_space> Hunt those snailss to extinction honestly
[6:13:21] <Baeltyr> i hate these fucking ants
[6:13:21] <cavefishes> prob my fave area
[6:13:26] <+LandOfTheWay> so yes, whole tree made for the cursed and scorned, cause lord knows the erdtree wasn't helping with that considering their policy for what to do with omens
[6:13:29] <+RushUnplugged> @anoldtoilet nope, crystallians as RESPAWNING SUMMONS from the slugs lol
[6:13:30] <+alphonseisbest> @brassnarwhal selfcest is  best cest Kappa
[6:13:31] <SIydoc> radagon and marika having kids being bad doesnt expain morgott and mohg though since their godfreys kids
[6:13:38] <boostergoldz> i first ran into crystillians as normal enemies. there's a few of them hanging out in the west half of the lake.
[6:13:43] <+anoldtoilet> @anoldtoilet hahahahaha
[6:13:44] <+MarkoTolstov> ANTS! Ants! Ant-man! Ants!!
[6:13:48] <ape_hawk> not one, but four!
[6:13:51] <%Brassnarwhal> @alphonseisbest who knows what you like better than you?
[6:13:51] <Khester824> still picked it up
[6:13:56] <%EldritchBee> @SIydoc They're omens of bad shit to come
[6:13:59] <Ghufufin> lepidopterist
[6:13:59] <SinisterBroccoli> I think those are used for rot cures
[6:13:59] <Sunstalker> Remember to pull out fire sword next death, just to see if it's making life easier on ya here
[6:14:01] <rosabellamelantha> @SIydoc they just got unlucky
[6:14:05] <ohno58> The really treats those like they're super valuable
[6:14:06] <TheSandmanIsHere> wrong
[6:14:06] <AgnusLaplace> maybe the erdtree is just a regular sized tree and everyone is just small
[6:14:10] <%luftraumm1> someone was saying in woolie's chat that the arteria leaves have a purpose?
[6:14:11] <sjcodan> OOPS ALL CURSES AND INCEST
[6:14:12] <some_brave_apollo> that's just bad luck
[6:14:17] <+RushUnplugged> mohg was just supergay for miquella
[6:14:18] <TheSandmanIsHere> all the M kids were kids of Radagon and Marika
[6:14:21] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> Marika genes are just fucked
[6:14:23] <+RushUnplugged> (actual lore)
[6:14:24] <+Tredecian> might be after godfrey became tarnished
[6:14:25] <+anoldtoilet> @luftraumm1 yeah theyre for crafting bleed items
[6:14:26] <%NBUsagi> wasnt Godfry like a blood thirsty warlord who had to slay a bunch of people to become Elden Lord? like it sounds like the only one that came out right was Godwyn
[6:14:30] <+anoldtoilet> like bleed arrows
[6:14:38] <xerotwo> FamilyMan O O P A W W
[6:14:41] <zenith0111> Underleveled?
[6:14:43] <badhaye> it's a snake snail
[6:14:44] <halfmasks> The lesson is sometimes the kids are just shit
[6:14:45] <no123450n> look at it go tho
[6:14:46] <TrollKing96> I think anyone can be born an Omen, no matter your heritage.
[6:14:47] <sjcodan> Oh, he'll die to pick up THOSE runes, but 200k was nothing
[6:14:47] <Vermillion129> all I can say is the entire family tree being a bunch of fucked up is just right up GRRM's alley
[6:14:49] <ohno58> yep wall to wall cancer
[6:14:50] <SinisterBroccoli> @RushUnplugged Who was a child forever
[6:14:51] <no123450n> singing snek
[6:14:53] <badhaye> so either a snake or a snail
[6:14:53] <ghoulspan> SETTLE DOWN SON
[6:14:54] <+LandOfTheWay> Mohg and Morgott have a birth defect, not a curse
[6:14:55] <NewWillinium> . . Elden Ring just CRASHED on me! During a cutscene.
[6:15:01] <SIydoc> pats level is fine for this place
[6:15:02] <+swesterly> empyreans are fucking numens, just cosmic ants crawling on the erdtree spawned by the elden ring sent by the greater will
[6:15:02] <Omenaire_> striking weapons work against those crystal guys
[6:15:05] <%luftraumm1> @luftraumm1 someone said that they had something more important than that, but idk
[6:15:06] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> those snails just vibin
[6:15:07] <%EldritchBee> We don't even know what Godwyn got up to when he was still alive, so he couldve been just as fucked
[6:15:07] <sjcodan> I beat the game at 150, pat's pretty on level
[6:15:07] <digaogrunge> THROW ROCK
[6:15:08] <zaptar13> Just need to run past everything towards the end of the game
[6:15:11] <@QueequegTheater> Sure Kappa
[6:15:11] <cavefishes> i had the same experience
[6:15:15] <+swesterly> it's all aliens and outer gods
[6:15:16] <%SveriSageAdvice> this area's scaling is claimed to be bugged, and is on a NG+ scale
[6:15:17] <Vermillion129> I came here at 190 and found insane amount of summon signs
[6:15:17] <armadaofghosts> I find it kinda funny that Miquella, the eternal child, was granted essentially an oversized treehouse.
[6:15:17] <boostergoldz> I was 155 doing this area and did no rune farming.
[6:15:22] <halfmasks> Why not throw rocks
[6:15:26] <some_brave_apollo> if this whole zone just had 40% less enemies overall it would be a lot more enjoyable
[6:15:27] <%SveriSageAdvice> remains to be seen if thats actually true
[6:15:29] <ArgentUndaCova> Stopped him before the big cast mopSwat
[6:15:32] <Omenaire_> try da rock
[6:15:32] <ArgentUndaCova> mopSweat *
[6:15:34] <sjcodan> LISTEN
[6:15:34] <MartyFun11> You can hear it
[6:15:34] <%fanciful_fright> I don't think that Radagon and Marika literally fucked each other. Considering, well, how they work physically.
[6:15:36] <%NBUsagi> oh it is taking no damage
[6:15:39] <sjcodan> SLUG MAKE NOISE
[6:15:50] <%EldritchBee> OUM OUM OUM OUM
[6:16:00] <peachy996> Mickey's Treehouse
[6:16:01] <sjcodan> Those guys ALWAYS take no damage until you crack them
[6:16:09] <it_came_from_outer_space> bad city with too many ladders
[6:16:10] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> if you could clone yourself, you'd make it work
[6:16:12] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt yeah pat I had a few people run some test and haligtree might be completely fucked as the damage values are the same on NG and NG+
[6:16:13] <NewWillinium> And Mohg tried to force Miqella into his bedchamber, and was just. . . all of the Evil.   Rykard was a loving family man and Inquisitor, before becoming the BIGGEST Hesiarch
[6:16:13] <%luftraumm1> twinkle twankle
[6:16:14] <%CopperTucker> is this a Bloodborne
[6:16:19] <+anoldtoilet> @sjcodan they take regular dam from blunt weapons
[6:16:24] <+ATorL> they're weak to blunt damage
[6:16:25] <SIydoc> hell apparently there was another alien god before the greater will that peaced out before the erdtree was even a thing
[6:16:25] <it_came_from_outer_space> Urban planners off their rockers imo
[6:16:28] <+swesterly> @fanciful_fright nah they split at some point and were only bound again in imprisonment as punishment for marika's destruction of the elden ring
[6:16:36] <Vermillion129> yea mogh and miquella stuff is kinda yikes
[6:16:39] <sjcodan> Yeah but who uses blunt weapons anyway
[6:16:40] <%EldritchBee> Radhan was like, the only NORMAL one of these demigos
[6:16:45] <oda_flobunaga> self-cest is a tag for a reason.
[6:16:53] <%ElkRiverDog> Fun fact: "Halig" is Old English for "holy", but it also has connotations of "Hale, healthy".
[6:16:54] <+LandOfTheWay> @fanciful_fright honestly, they might have. some lore indicates radagon was doing stuff at the same time marika was elsewhere, so the latter may have splintered off from the former
[6:16:57] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> yeah the incest was fine by the gods, it was the ring they cared about
[6:16:59] <+swesterly> @SIydoc assumedly whoever placidusax worshipped beyond time
[6:17:07] <SIydoc> yea
[6:17:17] <%NBUsagi> Radhan does seem to be the most wholesome out of all of them, considering he protected the world from falling stars and loved his horse?
[6:17:20] <some_brave_apollo> I think renalla was pretty normal until her husband left her
[6:17:20] <zenith0111> @sjcodan Stagger chads
[6:17:24] <+cursedwithadhd> this reminds me of the bird architecture from The Outer Wilds
[6:17:24] <rosabellamelantha> So I was super wrong earlier BTW NG+ Haligtree is NOT easier it's just literally the same as NG which means it's still broken as hell
[6:17:27] <+Tredecian> yes
[6:17:28] <Sunstalker> Trash mobs with grabs that do 50% of a tank's hp. D:
[6:17:28] <%MrMegaJackpots> yeah
[6:17:29] <$OfficerMods> its a souls game
[6:17:30] <+alphonseisbest> YES
[6:17:31] <sjcodan> Correct
[6:17:34] <SinisterBroccoli> yeah sounds about right
[6:17:34] <%sniffy77> Pat someone might want that scrimbo
[6:17:35] <%Brassnarwhal> @elkriverdog so they nicknamed the big guy tiny huh?
[6:17:36] <it_came_from_outer_space> there are so many items
[6:17:38] <sjcodan> Anything worth a fuck will be in a chest
[6:17:38] <+CherteuseKapibara> cliffs, traps
[6:17:39] <Vermillion129> Yea that sound about right for souls game
[6:17:39] <V0LK__> its because all "real items" are now craftable
[6:17:40] <+alphonseisbest> FUCKIN RED LEAFS BS
[6:17:40] <it_came_from_outer_space> soooo many items
[6:17:44] <no123450n> yes, but maybe it's good tho
[6:17:52] <wolfen091> but pat, crafting though
[6:17:56] <NewWillinium> @NBUsagi Wasn't he mostly doing that JUST to block Ranni's path to becoming the Elden Lord?
[6:17:57] <Vermillion129> found a purple item? it's a gravel LUL
[6:17:57] <MartyFun11> Is there a confirmation that the stats are exactly the same in NG+
[6:17:57] <%Pookiedaexzile> Negative  impact Bias
[6:18:05] <zaptar13> its a great trap. Unfortunately Patches doesn't take advantage
[6:18:11] <sjcodan> FUCK CRAFTING ANYTHING OTHER THAN GREASE AND ARROWS
[6:18:11] <it_came_from_outer_space> Yes
[6:18:13] <%twistedj3ster> probably
[6:18:16] <%ElkRiverDog> @Brassnarwhal pretty much
[6:18:18] <AgnusLaplace> probably
[6:18:18] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> "we placed it there, as a joke"
[6:18:19] <it_came_from_outer_space> well that and crafting arrows
[6:18:19] <SIydoc> not sure but ranni didnt want to be elden lord anyway
[6:18:21] <it_came_from_outer_space> thats also nice
[6:18:23] <wolfen091> I've seen worse excuses for a crafting system
[6:18:25] <%twistedj3ster> they needed to pad some of the dead ends
[6:18:27] <sothatsprettybrutal> they could have just all been pebbles
[6:18:33] <+swesterly> @NBUsagi redahn was the star scourge, he hated the moon and the celestial outer god worshipped by ranni
[6:18:39] <+anoldtoilet> i like the crafting in this game because im insane
[6:18:43] <%furiousfurioso> I've mostly only crafted the rot and poison healing doodads
[6:18:43] <%NBUsagi> @NBUsagi Ranni was his mom though wasnt she? Cause he is a child of Radagon and Ranni
[6:18:44] <TwistParabola> fuckzone ahead
[6:18:44] <Sunstalker> Crafting Iron Flesh perfume is prety dope though
[6:18:47] <sjcodan> Yesn't
[6:18:50] <digaogrunge> Crafting is really powerfull in this game
[6:18:52] <+MarkoTolstov> @sjcodan boluses?
[6:18:58] <thesaverofhumens> just tuned in, what sword is pat using?
[6:19:02] <+SLVRBAKSLPZ> that thing face was fucked
[6:19:05] <SinisterBroccoli> this game is literally all about the deformed and mishapen
[6:19:07] <SIydoc> ranni is radahns sister, their mom is rannela
[6:19:08] <TwistParabola> @NBUsagi Rennala and Radagon
[6:19:08] <NewWillinium> @NBUsagi Not a child of Ranni, a Child of Ranni's mother
[6:19:10] <%NBUsagi> No wait shit, Rhadan is the child of Radagon and Renala
[6:19:12] <+swesterly> @SIydoc ranni was like yo fuck lords and servants fuck all social order let's go to space
[6:19:14] <%Brassnarwhal> @patstaresat giving crafting materials in the dungeons could reasonably be a concession to players who don't spend time foraging and need a bare minimum of mats for people who need crafted items
[6:19:16] <%EldritchBee> @NBUsagi Radhan is child of Radagon and Renalla, Ranni is his sister(maybe half sister)
[6:19:19] <Vermillion129> Oh these guys
[6:19:20] <sjcodan> @MarkoTolstov I never found the poison heal so I just chugged until it went away
[6:19:26] <boostergoldz> lmao
[6:19:27] <+anoldtoilet> LUL
[6:19:31] <NewWillinium> Stronk Mage is here to fite
[6:19:31] <zenith0111> LUL
[6:19:33] <tolloponik> wow the scarlet rot grew all the way up here?
[6:19:34] <sothatsprettybrutal> nothing more magic than a big rock
[6:19:34] <sjcodan> BUT IT WASNT A ROCK
[6:19:35] <TwistParabola> LUL
[6:19:40] <sjcodan> IT WAS A ROCK LOBSTER
[6:19:42] <%Brassnarwhal> ROCK
[6:19:42] <ohno58> he tried to run up on you
[6:19:43] <xerotwo> LUL\
[6:19:43] <%fanciful_fright> I just think its a little weird to assume that Radagon and Marika work in the same way humans do, considering they're about as human as Ebreitas was.
[6:19:45] <xerotwo> LUL
[6:19:51] <%luftraumm1> rocks trump magic
[6:19:54] <%EldritchBee> The Regen Physick outheals basic poison anyway
[6:19:57] <%Brassnarwhal> steal their clothes
[6:19:57] <zenith0111> Wizard who spent years of his life dedicated to sorcery vs a Big Rock. Who wins?
[6:20:07] <rosabellamelantha> Ranni and Radahn (and Godfrey) are the ONLY NORMAL KIDS
[6:20:15] <%Brassnarwhal> @eldritchbee that's why i use it tbh
[6:20:20] <TwistParabola> these zones are super generous with runes
[6:20:20] <V0LK__> this is looking like Rivendell now
[6:20:21] <rosabellamelantha> it is
[6:20:26] <Vermillion129> yes it is
[6:20:28] <RustyQuarters> Why is there a Wookie village in my Fromsoft game?
[6:20:28] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @rosabellamelantha idk, Ranni had Godwyn murdered.
[6:20:29] <+anoldtoilet> yeah if marika is capable of splitting herself into two people and reproducing with herself she definitely only looks like a person out of convenience
[6:20:34] <%EldritchBee> @rosabellamelantha Rykard was normal and then he got snorny(snake horny)
[6:20:34] <+anoldtoilet> this is some alien shit
[6:20:37] <it_came_from_outer_space> up
[6:20:37] <%ElkRiverDog> All this family tree talk is reminding me of the mess that was the Hapsburgs
[6:20:37] <+swesterly> @fanciful_fright they don't have to work exactly the same way in order to be physically separate, especially considering they were explicitly reintegrated as punsihment
[6:20:40] <jacksawjack> Pointy Earred Leaf Lovers
[6:20:41] <+RushUnplugged> it's big shortcut
[6:20:43] <%luftraumm1> first platform?
[6:20:46] <AgnusLaplace> "it's becoming understandable" he's gonna get lost as fuck isn't he?
[6:20:48] <+anoldtoilet> ranni is possibly not alive anymore and being puppeted by star creatures
[6:20:54] <%NBUsagi> I mean they are weird esoteric gods, Zeus himself gave birth to 2 gods just by pretty my mitosis? Athena was in his head and he cracked it open and i think it was Artemis he cut out of his thigh? Essentilaly gods are weird beings that work in weird ways humans dont
[6:21:01] <sjcodan> Local man stores things he might need in chest
[6:21:01] <TwistParabola> @AgnusLaplace he hasn't seen anything yet
[6:21:03] <oda_flobunaga> @EldritchBee You mean scaley, its a real thing
[6:21:21] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> @anoldtoilet She is literally super anti gods, and is alive in soul only
[6:21:24] <rosabellamelantha> @rosabellamelantha Murdering for your own goals is not the same as being actively cursed but yeah Rykard too I guess, Rykard was also rennala's though
[6:21:33] <%Brassnarwhal> @nbusagi so you're saying they reproduce by budding?
[6:21:33] <NewWillinium> Didn't Ranni work with Rykard to have Godwyn killed so that she could take half of his Rune of Death to kill her mortal Body?
[6:21:40] <badhaye> Putting my controller down so I can watch the next part
[6:21:43] <tolloponik> the randomizer mods for this game will be soul annihilating
[6:21:45] <+swesterly> @anoldtoilet nah ranni bound her soul into a vessel in order to have immortality without having it be the gift of the greater will, though she does worship the outer god of the moon
[6:21:45] <%pinkslimegoblin> upgrade to 10?
[6:21:46] <sjcodan> Nobody tell him
[6:21:47] <%NBUsagi> @Brassnarwhal I mean if they want to pretty much
[6:21:52] <%xcompleasedad> Had Pat fought the guy with the FACE yet?
[6:22:09] <Sigma_190_Beta> @NewWillinium No Ranni wanted to die first to get the Rune of Death herself.
[6:22:13] <V0LK__> Elden Ring Master quest
[6:22:13] <%Niney_Who> Randomizer is the definition of unreasonable
[6:22:16] <sothatsprettybrutal> what we fighting here in this huge open area
[6:22:16] <RustyQuarters> monkaS
[6:22:18] <badhaye> YEEEEEAAAAHHHH
[6:22:19] <kinkade_77> randomized should be fun
[6:22:19] <Vermillion129> She'sssss back
[6:22:26] <SIydoc> non ghost loretta
[6:22:26] <@QueequegTheater> THE RETURN
[6:22:26] <rosabellamelantha> @anoldtoilet The Dark Moon isn't an actual outer god so much as a force
[6:22:27] <%NBUsagi> Oh she looks bad ass
[6:22:32] <it_came_from_outer_space> Loretta ur so cool
[6:22:32] <%fanciful_fright> @NewWillinium Mmmmmaybe? Godwyn was always supposed to die though, at worst Ranni just messed it up.
[6:22:33] <42nfl19> SUMMONED SWORD
[6:22:33] <SuperBloodWolfMoon> Loretta is so cool. Respecced to in cause she's so cool.
[6:22:33] <DancesWitBalrog> not a ghost this time
[6:22:35] <some_brave_apollo> her armor is awesome
[6:22:38] <Zebroneath> there are way too many item points spawns for a randomizer
[6:22:39] <ohno58> omg look how pretty loretta is
[6:22:39] <SinisterBroccoli> her spear is so cool
[6:22:39] <sjcodan> Fuckin baddass too
[6:22:39] <%livi242> she's got a great int weapon
[6:22:41] <V0LK__> POWA WAVE!
[6:22:42] <badhaye> The other fight was a Ranni Summon
[6:22:43] <RustyQuarters> Mimic Pat is so much cooler than real pat
[6:22:45] <AgnusLaplace> he trained a horse to do this shit?
[6:22:47] <%Valdorick> Ah, I see Pat went back to the Blasphemous Sword
[6:22:50] <%Monkeyweed21> @NewWillinium Rykard wasnt involved, Ranni stole the Rune of Death and collabed with the Black Knife Assassins so she could shed her Empyrean flesh and Those Who Live in Death could get their own prince of death from Godwyn
[6:22:59] <rosabellamelantha> @anoldtoilet like the astrologians already worshipped it alongside the greater will until a certain starscourge stopped the stars
[6:23:00] <RustyQuarters> POWA GAYSER
[6:23:00] <Sigma_190_Beta> @PatStaresAt You know what would be a fun randomizer as long as it's made fair? A Boss randomizer.
[6:23:03] <%NBUsagi> Bad ass spell knight lady 0w 0
[6:23:04] <+swesterly> @NewWillinium ranni wanted the rune of death explicitly to smash to age of order and defy the greater will
[6:23:05] <%DashXero> Got her in a bit of a wobbly H...
[6:23:19] <SinisterBroccoli> her weapons are sick af
[6:23:19] <RustyQuarters> @V0LK__ R U OK?!
[6:23:29] <%EldritchBee> Ranni didn't want to be an empyrean, so she killed her physical body to shed all connection to the Two Fingers
[6:23:30] <sjcodan> Mimic really does kinda play the game for you, huh
[6:23:33] <oda_flobunaga> A Remixer that just makes every enemy Malenia
[6:23:34] <Zebroneath> nice
[6:23:37] <AgnusLaplace> pure cheese
[6:23:40] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> @Monkeyweed21 I think he was, there is an item later on that says that she gave him something to protect him from the black blade
[6:23:43] <V0LK__> @RustyQuarters BUSTA WOLF
[6:23:45] <xanerts> bruh
[6:23:45] <TwistParabola> nice
[6:23:45] <42nfl19> My brain autocompletes Mimic Tear as Mimir for short
[6:23:47] <SuperBloodWolfMoon> my mimic just eats shit and dies :(
[6:23:47] <badhaye> dude she's so cool
[6:23:48] <zenith0111> NICE
[6:23:49] <%EldritchBee> Coolest halberd in the game
[6:23:50] <%Valdorick> Honestly, with that weapon art, the boss of this area won't be shit to you.
[6:23:51] <SIydoc> i dont think ranni specifically targeted godwyn, he just got unlucky
[6:23:55] <+swesterly> @Monkeyweed21 this. ranni and fia serve different outer gods but their interests aligned in seeing godwyn assassinated
[6:23:56] <NewWillinium> That Bow is part of got me through the Boss fight at the end of the game.
[6:24:01] <42nfl19> @PatStaresAt So is this place actually snow or some bullshit like ash?
[6:24:01] <+TheBitingIrish> You can buy her armor from Enia
[6:24:03] <badhaye> her gear is back at the roundtavble
[6:24:05] <%EldritchBee> Unique halberd moveset
[6:24:06] <+Glidemusic> Rykard sword reminds me of the behelit sword form berserk
[6:24:06] <%Niney_Who> so she turned her Staff into a Polearm
[6:24:06] <RustyQuarters> YO?!
[6:24:08] <%TheAdMerlin> Does it count as a staff though
[6:24:08] <V0LK__> damn, thats a nice moveset
[6:24:12] <%Valdorick> That's a good moveset!
[6:24:19] <BreakfastSampler> Sick
[6:24:19] <sothatsprettybrutal> unalloyed gold, nice and soft
[6:24:19] <+ATorL> that's really similar to the Guardian Swordspear moveset
[6:24:19] <$SGrim> YO\
[6:24:20] <rosabellamelantha> Again Ranni doesn't serve an outer god, the dark moon ISN'T A GOD
[6:24:21] <SinisterBroccoli> That's the weapon I want
[6:24:21] <VelkHarone> oh its the swordspear moveset
[6:24:22] <+ATorL> it's good
[6:24:22] <rosabellamelantha> it's a force
[6:24:24] <tolloponik> new int weapon goal
[6:24:24] <digaogrunge> THATH MOVESET
[6:24:25] <+MarkoTolstov> Loretta's Mastery does fucking damage with the spell damage buff crystal
[6:24:25] <RubberFistFight> is that the black knight halberd moveset?
[6:24:28] <+BubbaRands> SPEEEN
[6:24:29] <%X2Eliah> its the tree guardian swordspear movement
[6:24:31] <%Monkeyweed21> @swesterly Ranni didnt even want to kill Godwyn, she just needad a blade that could kill god flesh
[6:24:32] <%luftraumm1> isnt it simmilar to a scythe?
[6:24:36] <Sigma_190_Beta> @PatStaresAt Also shouldn't you equip Godrick's rune? Even if you don't use an arc it gives stats.
[6:24:36] <rosabellamelantha> Ranni is explicitely reject gods
[6:24:37] <TheSandmanIsHere> what are the stat requirements
[6:24:38] <Vermillion129> Man imagine if miriam use that
[6:24:43] <sjcodan> Not a ALL black knight halberd
[6:24:49] <%Niney_Who> It's big Sister lady
[6:24:49] <cavefishes> the greatbow kinda sucks compared to the regular one sadly
[6:24:51] <42nfl19> HUG
[6:24:51] <+anoldtoilet> ranni is just replace gods with different gods
[6:24:53] <ohno58> the r1 bounces off the floor sometimes
[6:24:54] <sjcodan> BKH is much more... Thunky
[6:24:54] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> it doesnt give stats without rune
[6:24:55] <%NBUsagi> Malenia shielding Miequlla?
[6:24:58] <Vermillion129> is that marika?
[6:24:58] <%fanciful_fright> @rosabellamelantha Well, Ranni rejected the Fingers.
[6:25:02] <digaogrunge> SISTERS
[6:25:05] <rosabellamelantha> @anoldtoilet No she isn't
[6:25:05] <oda_flobunaga> Now go, let the Legend come back to life
[6:25:07] <%X2Eliah> because the text says so
[6:25:09] <%Monkeyweed21> 2 arms now
[6:25:16] <badhaye> read the armor
[6:25:17] <+anoldtoilet> @PatStaresAt because the in game text has an error and it says it does.
[6:25:19] <+LandOfTheWay> yeah, ranni shared her mother's infatuation with the cosmos, not service to a god. she pretty explicitly wants to be free of that kind of order
[6:25:19] <rosabellamelantha> @anoldtoilet that is a gross misunderstanding of her ending that I hate
[6:25:19] <%luftraumm1> who's the second child?
[6:25:31] <@goose_attack_almanac> Doesn't it only give stats if you use a rune arc
[6:25:33] <+anoldtoilet> i know it doesnt actually do that but the in game description SAYS it does that.
[6:25:34] <halfmasks> you have to use the rune arc for it
[6:25:35] <%Brassnarwhal> you only get the stats if you turn it on
[6:25:40] <+swesterly> @rosabellamelantha the wiki says ranni serves the outer god of the moon where are you seeing that the dark moon isn't an outer god
[6:25:42] <+alphonseisbest> so what does it even do then?
[6:25:49] <@goose_attack_almanac> or am I thinking of a different rune entirely
[6:25:50] <+anoldtoilet> thats why people are mistaken because unlike you they read the entire item description
[6:25:51] <rosabellamelantha> @LandOfTheWay exactly, Ranni does not want ANY GODS to rule over the world
[6:25:52] <sjcodan> Pop a humanity, goddamn
[6:25:54] <+TheBitingIrish> Yeah, it's worded poorly
[6:25:54] <$OfficerMods> PLAY FOREVER 👏 👏 👏
[6:25:58] <Vermillion129> what does mogh rune even do
[6:26:02] <%EldritchBee> The wiki is fan run, not official
[6:26:03] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> soulsborne doesnt have the greatest trackrecord for item accuracy
[6:26:04] <BreakfastSampler> it gives its benefit with a rune arc, same as all the others
[6:26:04] <oda_flobunaga> Is this Anor Londo?
[6:26:05] <it_came_from_outer_space> The game text says that using a rune arc gives "even greater benefits" which implies it gives benefits passively
[6:26:05] <17sevens> rune arc is needed to get great rune benefits
[6:26:06] <42nfl19> If you turn it on, is it really a passive?
[6:26:06] <rosabellamelantha> @rosabellamelantha Are you seriously using fextralife as a source
[6:26:07] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @alphonseisbest +5 to all stats when you pop a Great Rune Arc/
[6:26:07] <wolfen091> still in a dream
[6:26:08] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> @anoldtoilet Her whole deal is that she doesn't want the gods meddling with men
[6:26:08] <%Call_Me_Deacon_Blues> NOT FOR HONOR
[6:26:09] <it_came_from_outer_space> but it doesnt
[6:26:11] <RustyQuarters> Blight City PogChamp
[6:26:12] <zenith0111> @rosabellamelantha In mythology celestial bodies are in fact gods
[6:26:12] <%NBUsagi> Maybe Radagon was prepairing to have everything handed over to Miquella? including giving him his own capitol?
[6:26:13] <+anoldtoilet> @LandOfTheWay is that why she opens the world to rule by outer beings
[6:26:13] <TwistParabola> what a thrill...
[6:26:14] <halfmasks> @alphonseisbest you have to use a rune arc for it to pop, its like a physick
[6:26:18] <%Monkeyweed21> welcome to the Ringed City
[6:26:21] <RustyQuarters> SNAKE EEEEATEEEEER
[6:26:21] <digaogrunge> Ringed City vibes
[6:26:22] <TwistParabola> I'm Searching and I'm Melting For youuuuuu
[6:26:23] <Zebroneath> bonus stats only proc on rune arc use
[6:26:31] <Evendrag> @Call_Me_Deacon_Blues but for you
[6:26:32] <+HuoShengdi> it pretty much is a second capital
[6:26:33] <sjcodan> You don't meme snake eater on the way down, nerds
[6:26:34] <+RedMaskBandit> guys pat never uses comsuables so telling him to slap on godrick is not based
[6:26:37] <+TheBitingIrish> What a thrill...
[6:26:37] <+anoldtoilet> the only one who explicitly wants no gods at all, reset the world to zero is frenzied flame iirc
[6:26:37] <ape_hawk> pat, i dont think youre finishing this game this week
[6:26:40] <RustyQuarters> Fromsoft loves fucked cities
[6:26:42] <+swesterly> @rosabellamelantha are you seriously questioning my source instead of stating your own?
[6:26:42] <Sunstalker> Pls be boxrats
[6:26:43] <V0LK__> why so many bloodstains near therre O_O'
[6:26:43] <%luftraumm1> out the wazzoo
[6:26:43] <coziestbank> Probably is like the original capital that got abandoned because of Rot
[6:26:46] <XxMoliciousxX> undead burg?
[6:26:50] <Zebroneath> they really want you to be ready
[6:26:51] <%Niney_Who> Lotta slabs
[6:26:53] <SinisterBroccoli> slabs
[6:26:54] <%JoshManVGH> @alphonseisbest Great Runes are like customizable Humanity effects. Instead of straight Health and Stamana, you can choose different effects
[6:26:58] <%bluetocho13> bluetocho13 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 62 months! 
[6:27:03] <%EldritchBee> Not the OG capital, just Miquella and Malenias's home
[6:27:04] <Vermillion129> @V0LK__ gravity LUL
[6:27:09] <%NBUsagi> Down into caiptol 2 electric bugaloo
[6:27:09] <+LandOfTheWay> @anoldtoilet she... doesn't? she creates an order embracing the uncertainty of cosmic knowledge, not one of rule by outer gods
[6:27:11] <sjcodan> Pat he meant left as in the stairs
[6:27:13] <sjcodan> lol
[6:27:18] <%JoshManVGH> But you gotta pop a humanity/ember to get the benifits
[6:27:20] <rosabellamelantha> @LandOfTheWay No did you not talk to her in her chambers at all? she outright says she will keep the stars FAR AWAY from the earth and nothing will decide humanity's fate but their own
[6:27:25] <SIydoc> actually the frenzy flame wants everything returned to nothing to kinda make a singular god
[6:27:29] <Vermillion129> I check those bloodstain and they all fall while running back
[6:27:29] <%Niney_Who> Anor Londo 3
[6:27:30] <Sunstalker> ANOTHER ANOR LONDO LuL
[6:27:31] <senfood> @PatStaresAt What do you plan to get to +25 before true endgame?
[6:27:33] <%Felhad> Welcome to hell 2.0
[6:27:36] <TwistParabola> The Ringed City!
[6:27:36] <Omenaire_> its a big tree
[6:27:38] <@Spydurman> holy shit
[6:27:38] <halfmasks> OH GOD
[6:27:38] <%EldritchBee> it IS rotting
[6:27:38] <%fanciful_fright> @coziestbank Nope, this is basically where Miquella went off to when trying to go full god, before Mohg happened.
[6:27:39] <sothatsprettybrutal> so there's just anor londo down here too
[6:27:40] <V0LK__> its a big pot city? :O
[6:27:42] <buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut> That sword WutFace
[6:27:42] <thesaverofhumens> lisa needs braces
[6:27:42] <%Monkeyweed21> THE RINGED CITY
[6:27:42] <+anoldtoilet> @LandOfTheWay the moon and stars are not aligned and ranni is under the influence of it
[6:27:42] <sjcodan> It's holdin it up, baby!
[6:27:42] <XxMoliciousxX> gondor?
[6:27:45] <+Grayhammatter> oh look, anor londo
[6:27:46] <rosabellamelantha> Seriously anyone arguing that she wants to replace them didn't actually talk to Ranni in her Chamber
[6:27:46] <sothatsprettybrutal> we have anor londo at home
[6:27:46] <%Brassnarwhal> the ringed city
[6:27:47] <boostergoldz> it's a rotting tree after all
[6:27:48] <+anoldtoilet> moon and stars are enemies
[6:27:48] <+Tredecian> its build around the tree like a ring
[6:27:48] <Zebroneath> Resembles Gondor a bit
[6:27:52] <zenith0111> TREE ON LICE SUPPORT
[6:27:52] <Varanoo> The original capital is cool
[6:27:55] <zenith0111> LIFE*
[6:27:59] <%TheAdMerlin> Brace against the ocean
[6:28:01] <@Spydurman> dis dick is +25
[6:28:03] <%NBUsagi> Big lady 0w 0
[6:28:05] <tolloponik> another one?
[6:28:12] <+anoldtoilet> ranni doesnt want the stars to influence you because she serves the moon. thats it
[6:28:14] <rosabellamelantha> @LandOfTheWay that is not correct at all please actually go talk to ranni
[6:28:14] <%Monkeyweed21> oh shit look at this cleanrot farming set
[6:28:16] <sjcodan> I think the fire was better
[6:28:21] <rosabellamelantha> literally just go to her chambers
[6:28:22] <%Monkeyweed21> spot*
[6:28:22] <sjcodan> The flames made her recoil
[6:28:23] <cavefishes> these knights are cool as fuck
[6:28:23] <Omenaire_> this knight is sick
[6:28:24] <sothatsprettybrutal> this guy is cool
[6:28:26] <42nfl19> @PatStaresAt Wait wtf +25? It aint +10???
[6:28:30] <RustyQuarters> omg shoes
[6:28:33] <%EldritchBee> @Monkeyweed21 better cleanrot farm is from heart of Aeonia
[6:28:39] <%tetraes> Cleanrots resist Holy
[6:28:42] <sjcodan> +10 for somber weapons, 25 for normal
[6:28:45] <TwistParabola> exhaust her dialogue!
[6:28:46] <$OfficerMods> they 100% could have sold this area as dlc a few months after release and no one would blink
[6:28:48] <Vermillion129> @42nfl19 normal weapon is plus +25, unique weapon is +10
[6:28:51] <+anoldtoilet> @LandOfTheWay literally read item descriptions. ranni herself is either leaving things out intentionally or a puppet
[6:28:52] <Evendrag> try not to miss her stuff, finding it is kinda tuff
[6:28:58] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt completing her quest here requires some BS
[6:29:01] <%EldritchBee> Millecent my Beloved, I love you so much
[6:29:05] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> the lack of arm is genetic
[6:29:09] <+anoldtoilet> the moon is an external presence influencing minds and fate and its not aligned with astel or the stars
[6:29:10] <%SveriSageAdvice> her quest for the next part is super easily missable btw @PatStaresAt
[6:29:14] <ohno58> who did Malenia fuck though?
[6:29:17] <%Monkeyweed21> what badass is her dad?
[6:29:19] <+swesterly> @rosabellamelantha i understand her intention is about rejecting outer god lordship and humanity's servitude, but that isn't  exclusive to her goals falling in line with the unknown motives of the dark moon
[6:29:21] <%EldritchBee> REMEMBER: FALLING ON NPCS DEALS DAMAGE DONT FALL ON HER EVER
[6:29:22] <Talinu> reedahn?
[6:29:24] <%Brassnarwhal> OFFSHOOT SEEMS LIKE AN IMPORTANT CONCEPT
[6:29:26] <SIydoc> yes
[6:29:26] <sjcodan> SUPER EASILY MISSABLE
[6:29:26] <%whyskeywolfe> Yeah we'll tell you where it is
[6:29:27] <Vermillion129> yea it's here
[6:29:28] <%dekkitout> Just noticed Pat has that neato sword mage of fingies
[6:29:29] <+Tredecian> yes
[6:29:29] <sjcodan> But yes
[6:29:29] <Evendrag> yeah, its off to the side
[6:29:29] <oda_flobunaga> yes
[6:29:30] <%strakillias> Wait is she an anime-esque split off personality?
[6:29:30] <Zebroneath> in this zone, yes
[6:29:30] <%pinkslimegoblin> did she also have to cheese radahn with scarlet rot?
[6:29:30] <%SveriSageAdvice> its super far ahead in a big chasm area
[6:29:31] <TwistParabola> yeah
[6:29:33] <TwistParabola> we'll tell you.
[6:29:33] <sjcodan> its in this area
[6:29:38] <sothatsprettybrutal> my sister, my daughter, my sister, my daughter
[6:29:39] <%EldritchBee> DO NOT DROP ONTO ANY NPCS EVER
[6:29:40] <SIydoc> you have to kill one of the big tree snake worm things
[6:29:40] <+LandOfTheWay> @rosabellamelantha @anoldtoilet i did, as a matter of fact. i also read all relevant item descriptions, including all of her associated armor, weapons, and spells
[6:29:41] <+anoldtoilet> @pinkslimegoblin yes
[6:29:43] <+anoldtoilet> lol
[6:29:43] <TwistParabola> @pinkslimegoblin she kinda did
[6:29:43] <Evendrag> after some dank miyazaki shit
[6:29:44] <ohno58> also don't jump near her
[6:29:44] <+HuoShengdi> it's easily overlooked but it's not actually missable
[6:29:52] <%Brassnarwhal> sveri always has sage advice
[6:29:53] <cavefishes> there's a big snake wiggly tree guy to fight
[6:29:53] <TwistParabola> welcome to hell
[6:29:59] <%xcompleasedad> @sothatsprettybrutal Oh God, not Chinatown AGAIN
[6:30:01] <rosabellamelantha> reading comprehension for ranni's stuff is like 0 I s2g
[6:30:02] <peachy996> Lol that premature drink
[6:30:03] <%dekkitout> Cause of Princess Filianore?
[6:30:03] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> DOOT
[6:30:03] <%Brassnarwhal> @huoshengdi so easily forgotten
[6:30:08] <%Niney_Who> He was thirmsty
[6:30:10] <Evendrag> he thought he had a horn lmao
[6:30:10] <Lulu19> holy zealots
[6:30:11] <%doc_ock_rokc> THE TREE IS GREAT
[6:30:12] <%livi242> this whole area felt like the size of a DS3 dlc
[6:30:12] <%radiorosewater> ya kinda are
[6:30:13] <cavefishes> yeah this whole place felt like a DLC zone i love it
[6:30:16] <%Brassnarwhal> DOOT
[6:30:17] <+Tredecian> this is a great farm spot these guys a re easy
[6:30:17] <%NBUsagi> makes sense, fire burns away the rot
[6:30:24] <%luftraumm1> haligtree crest surcoat lore?
[6:30:25] <Midnight188> does anyone in chat know where in here is the secret teleporter to Mohgwyn Palace? because I cant find it.
[6:30:28] <sothatsprettybrutal> @sothatsprettybrutal it's all chinatown
[6:30:36] <tolloponik> runs up to opponent takes drugs win fight?
[6:30:39] <Gimplock> @PatStaresAt  were did you get that sword?
[6:30:39] <%Brassnarwhal> armor lore?
[6:30:40] <+SLVRBAKSLPZ> Pat they were on break WTF
[6:30:47] <thesaverofhumens> unholy
[6:30:47] <%EldritchBee> @Midnight188 It's not in Haligtree, it's in the snowfields
[6:30:48] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> halig even
[6:30:55] <SinisterBroccoli> is there any fire weapons that scale with int?
[6:30:56] <+swesterly> @rosabellamelantha imagine doubling down and calling everyone else dumb while acting like an ass without backing up any of your claims
[6:30:57] <42nfl19> EGGS?
[6:30:58] <boostergoldz> the teleporter to mohgwyn is in the west part of the snowfields
[6:31:01] <Sunstalker> Rykard's deepthroating sword
[6:31:01] <Evendrag> u gotta trade in rykards shit
[6:31:02] <NewWillinium> His moving not dead head
[6:31:03] <%Valdorick> Its a good fuck'n sword
[6:31:03] <%fanciful_fright> @Midnight188 Its along the cliffside in consecrated snowfields
[6:31:03] <%NBUsagi> Lol oh god is this city also broken into sectors?
[6:31:05] <ohno58> they be dropping runes tho
[6:31:05] <%Monkeyweed21> the burning Vord seems good
[6:31:11] <@Spydurman> its so big jesus
[6:31:12] <boostergoldz> fire is fai in this game
[6:31:14] <oda_flobunaga> @Midnight188 Consecrated snowfield to the west
[6:31:16] <+alphonseisbest> @midnight188 the early one or the late one?
[6:31:17] <+Tredecian> @Midnight188 it's in consecrated snowfield near teh sanguine noble invasion near a cliff
[6:31:18] <Lulu19> this area is dope, tons of secrets
[6:31:20] <Vermillion129> @Midnight188 it's the west area of mountain top of giant
[6:31:20] <%soloshotfirst82> How could anyone live here?  It looks like an incredible bitch to navigate.
[6:31:22] <Midnight188> @EldritchBee I thought I needed the medallion to get there from the Lift...
[6:31:26] <+anoldtoilet> hmmm
[6:31:26] <TwistParabola> yup
[6:31:34] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> maybe?
[6:31:35] <coziestbank> Aliem mind control spores
[6:31:37] <some_brave_apollo> i bet it stinks
[6:31:38] <Midnight188> welp I went the wrong fuggin way
[6:31:41] <cavefishes> bro it's just a little rot it'll buff right out
[6:31:44] <cavefishes> no worries
[6:31:50] <%EldritchBee> @Midnight188 You use the medallion to get to the consecrated snowfields, then the snowfields to the haligtree
[6:31:56] <RubberFistFight> just run a cold tap on it, it'll be fine
[6:31:57] <%X2Eliah> is the tree actually just the alien spaceship they arrived in?
[6:31:57] <SinisterBroccoli> @some_brave_apollo idk poison is said to smell sweet
[6:32:02] <+MarkoTolstov> at this point of the game, I was legitimately too tired to bother exploring every part of these areas. I said fuck it and just explored some lol
[6:32:11] <%luftraumm1> uuuuu
[6:32:12] <Midnight188> I went way too far then gdi. BACK TO SNOW HELL
[6:32:20] <SuperBloodWolfMoon> the rot might be a parasite, like ivy. That would explain the vines on all the branches/roots.
[6:32:23] <boostergoldz> it's bad
[6:32:26] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @X2Eliah My headcanon is that it's like the one tree from Naruto.
[6:32:29] <%sniffy77> Just had Radahn jump up and disappear for 5 minutes. The host stayed though and we kicked his ass when he bugged back in
[6:32:35] <Vermillion129> LUL
[6:32:41] <TwistParabola> LUL
[6:32:43] <SuperBloodWolfMoon> oh that's a rot erdtree
[6:32:47] <thesaverofhumens> rotten tree
[6:32:51] <sjcodan> Shortcut for later
[6:33:00] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> looks like youre gonna have to jump
[6:33:02] <%Brassnarwhal> @superbloodwolfmoon lots of mushrooms around, spores can be parasitic too
[6:33:05] <%fanciful_fright> Gotta love putrid avatars
[6:33:05] <Vermillion129> they wont stop spamming
[6:33:09] <@goose_attack_almanac> man that thing needs to calm down
[6:33:13] <%Eldalu> oh he made
[6:33:14] <zenith0111> Wow hes zoning hard
[6:33:17] <sjcodan> HOW THE FUCK DID NONE OF THOSE HIT YOU
[6:33:17] <buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut> LUL
[6:33:17] <digaogrunge> gotta Jump
[6:33:18] <zenith0111> Pog
[6:33:18] <%Eldalu> mad
[6:33:19] <senfood> So, we're all in agreement that the Erdtree and everything involving it is parasitic, right?
[6:33:24] <%Brassnarwhal> this guy looks like he wants a rot dragon bath
[6:33:29] <zenith0111> That was cool
[6:33:31] <boostergoldz> oh man that blasphemous blade damage is so good
[6:33:31] <SuperBloodWolfMoon> @Brassnarwhal good call
[6:33:36] <%NBUsagi> Wait a mintue i recognize that paunch....ASSYLUM DEMON?
[6:33:43] <+anoldtoilet> oo0ooofffff
[6:33:47] <SinisterBroccoli> that's a LOT of damage
[6:33:47] <%luftraumm1> well played tho
[6:33:50] <sjcodan> Yup its 100% assylum demon
[6:33:50] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @senfood Definitely. It's forcing all souls to go through reincarnation for some reason.
[6:33:50] <+swesterly> @senfood yes, the erdtree and greater will are cosmic parasites
[6:33:52] <+wizard_of_diamonds> All things considered, I'm surprised Dungeater isn't from or allied with the foks in the Haligtree
[6:33:54] <%DashXero> @NBUsagi Yup.
[6:33:54] <%Brassnarwhal> @nbusagi the slam confirms it
[6:34:00] <+anoldtoilet> definitely seems that way yea
[6:34:01] <digaogrunge> beeg dmg on the art tho
[6:34:03] <godlesscruelty> that was prety good
[6:34:03] <%xcompleasedad> is that Asylum Demon with ROT?
[6:34:05] <zenith0111> Dying to Asylum Demon even 10 years later
[6:34:06] <turtlebits64> I'd recognize that fat ass anywhere
[6:34:07] <Evendrag> i beat the game with this weapon
[6:34:14] <RubberFistFight> best part is that's not even the worst encounter with one of those here
[6:34:17] <boostergoldz> I struggled dex/fai with a buffed +25 straight sword here.
[6:34:20] <+teddyz_ow> Hey pat, ive been binging your elden ring streams on youtube. glad to finally catch you live :D
[6:34:24] <%MrMegaJackpots> blasphemous blade carried me endgame
[6:34:26] <SIydoc> so have you seen the glitch where you can kill your allies with auto death procs
[6:34:28] <%Brassnarwhal> @wizard_of_diamonds he just wants to fuckncorpses he doesnt need a team
[6:34:33] <Sunstalker> You're fine, Pat. Stuff is just such beefcakes here, like everything's the npc hunters in bloodborne
[6:34:35] <+anoldtoilet> lol holy suicide bombs
[6:34:36] <+anoldtoilet> alright.
[6:34:39] <%NBUsagi> Honestly for a game this big, im not surprised they are reusing stuff. If it aint broke dont fix it
[6:34:40] <Padrexd24> hello chat
[6:34:41] <%fanciful_fright> @wizard_of_diamonds best thing about Dung Eater is that he's just an asshole. Absolutely unrepentant about it.
[6:34:44] <STORMWIZARD1> Pat what in the H*** are u doing go GETER DUN LUL
[6:34:45] <TwistParabola> they are actually
[6:34:49] <TwistParabola> they can drink flasks
[6:34:52] <ohno58> they're tired
[6:34:55] <$OfficerMods> much like the Vatican this holy city is filled with deadly toxins
[6:35:02] <TwistParabola> they were hell for my dex build
[6:35:08] <%EldritchBee> Dung Eater made me genuinely uncomfortable to be around, from knocked it out of the park with his shit
[6:35:18] <%Brassnarwhal> i wonder if you can defect and join the haligtree faction
[6:35:21] <sjcodan> Yes but actually no
[6:35:25] <%Brassnarwhal> dont answer that
[6:35:30] <some_brave_apollo> i think all the paths end up in the same place eventually
[6:35:33] <gryffinp> This whole area feels like a second dlc pack
[6:35:39] <%Brassnarwhal> @sjcodan vague enough for me
[6:35:40] <%Monkeyweed21> So if the people of the lands between and the Erdtree are british, are these the Welsh?
[6:35:50] <%EldritchBee> I like how their helms have crowns
[6:35:56] <%Brassnarwhal> @monkeyweed21 blaidd is the welsh
[6:36:07] <+TheBitingIrish> Damn, they Elden Blingin' in here
[6:36:13] <some_brave_apollo> @Monkeyweed21 the welsh are British, and all of the people in Raya Lucaria have Welsh accents
[6:36:15] <+swesterly> what is the nature of the curse sought by the dung eater
[6:36:22] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Monkeyweed21 not enought goats
[6:36:25] <ohno58> lucaria are welsh
[6:36:28] <+swesterly> is it a perversion of immortality
[6:36:29] <tolloponik> man these grunts would be bosses in a regular medieval setting
[6:36:30] <+leviting> its wild seeing all those different builds and its back to sword, board, and cape
[6:36:36] <%EldritchBee> @swesterly "fuck em"
[6:36:38] <RubberFistFight> @Monkeyweed21 if the lands of the erdtree = the lands between, they're all pretty predominantly welsh based on the accents
[6:36:39] <TwistParabola> yup
[6:36:39] <$OfficerMods> the welsh are not british
[6:36:42] <42nfl19> why is pat attacking people just taking a nap?
[6:36:47] <+Deebo305> @patstaresat and chat are the boost from the soreseals worth the damage increase?  I know every hit harder the further you go so generally curious
[6:36:47] <+imthinkingdarbys> sonic
[6:36:47] <%Brassnarwhal> @swesterly the curse of... Necrophillia
[6:36:48] <%luftraumm1> huuu?
[6:36:49] <%NBUsagi> @swesterly actually accurate
[6:36:50] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @swesterly It prevents the souls from returning to the Erdtree and forcibly locks them into suffering.
[6:36:51] <%fanciful_fright> Oh! I just realized what they're actually doing. They're drinking flasks of wonderous physick aren't they
[6:36:52] <Vermillion129> krillin?
[6:36:54] <zenith0111> They give sooooo many stonesword keys
[6:36:55] <@QueequegTheater> @OfficerMods They are, they're just not English
[6:36:56] <thesaverofhumens> gaels spell?
[6:36:57] <TwistParabola> Gael!
[6:37:02] <%dekkitout> Gael's spell?
[6:37:07] <%Brassnarwhal> @deebo305 it's worth it
[6:37:09] <tolloponik> its Gaels spell
[6:37:11] <$OfficerMods> ah ok got that backwards
[6:37:14] <+Grayhammatter> oh hey, now you can be gael
[6:37:15] <Talinu> @OfficerMods If anything the Welsh are the original British. The Anglos became Brits afterwrds.
[6:37:16] <%DashXero> How much Vigor do you recommend for an extremely short-range melee build?
[6:37:18] <sjcodan> The external is where you faught tree
[6:37:22] <zhenthrim213> his father/mother
[6:37:25] <sjcodan> 60
[6:37:25] <+anoldtoilet> @swesterly fwiw souls are not supposed to go to the erdtree and the tree is basically eating them for sustenance
[6:37:25] <%doc_ock_rokc> Its Darksouls gael's spell
[6:37:32] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @DashXero I'd say 60.
[6:37:35] <$drabberfaun535> any idea what mog's rune actually does?
[6:37:37] <+LandOfTheWay> @swesterly far as i can tell, it's just a curse of never-ending suffering of the soul, for no real purpose other than the suffering itself
[6:37:37] <TwistParabola> @DashXero 45 at least
[6:37:53] <sjcodan> I recommend 60 vigor to literally any build, you need it
[6:37:55] <%Brassnarwhal> @doc_ock_rokc my favorite video game icon, Darksouls Gael
[6:37:55] <%DashXero> Oh goddammit. I'm gonna need a lot more Vigor....
[6:37:56] <RubberFistFight> @OfficerMods Welsh are most definitely British. Source: I'm a welshman.
[6:37:59] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @drabberfaun535 When you invade someone, it gives you an item that buffs surrounding mobs.
[6:38:02] <%Monkeyweed21> @DashXero as much as you can get up to the soft cap of 60, as long as you do ENOUGH damage you want to have a healthy amount of vigor
[6:38:08] <gryffinp> jesus pat is in the 160s?
[6:38:10] <%fanciful_fright> @Deebo305 the damage taken is barely increased (like 10-15 points from what I know), feel free to use them
[6:38:11] <gryffinp> I'm still in the 120s
[6:38:20] <%Brassnarwhal> @sjcodan i got past fat apostle sub 20 😂
[6:38:31] <Laseki> oh shit destructo disks?
[6:38:35] <%Brassnarwhal> just dont get hit
[6:38:41] <@QueequegTheater> @RubberFistFight Aren't you Australian
[6:38:51] <%luftraumm1> twinkle twwankle
[6:38:53] <sjcodan> JUMP
[6:38:55] <some_brave_apollo> here it comes
[6:38:56] <sjcodan> ITS NOT DEATH
[6:38:57] <SIydoc> hey pat you should probably not go down
[6:39:02] <%luftraumm1> listen
[6:39:02] <RubberFistFight> @QueequegTheater I live in Australia, yes, but I was born in South Wales.
[6:39:03] <TheSandmanIsHere> no torrent?
[6:39:05] <senfood> I bet that message just says "fuck"
[6:39:07] <%Brassnarwhal> @laseki the triple version, i think the destructo disk weapon art is the best version i have found
[6:39:15] <%xcompleasedad> Drop a Rainbow?
[6:39:15] <sjcodan> No torrent, this is a dungeon
[6:39:18] <%dantejoestar21> what armor is he wearing?
[6:39:19] <+swesterly> @swesterly hmm it's odd how many nuances there are to death and the use of souls there are, fia and destined death seem distinct form the order of life and death of the erdtree, and erdtree feeding on the souls of the dead to fuel reincarnation also seems to be just for the benefit of the greater will, while ranni seems to be seeking immortality for cosmic transcendence of class
[6:39:21] <+anoldtoilet> @RubberFistFight did you move to New South Wales? LUL
[6:39:22] <42nfl19> What is that twinkling sound and the sound of bug wings in that room?
[6:39:22] <colonelcool12> Hi pat
[6:39:25] <Baeltyr> what are the triggers again, the items good for your build? Kappa
[6:39:26] <+FZeroDMX> Lmao I just warped to Stormveil and the ground wasn’t loaded in so I fell through the world
[6:39:29] <%Brassnarwhal> @laseki but it only works on scythes and halberds
[6:39:30] <SinisterBroccoli> Can you believe how hidden a place like this is tho?
[6:39:37] <thesaverofhumens> @42nfl19 probably a dung beetle
[6:39:40] <RubberFistFight> @anoldtoilet nah actually, Queensland, lol.
[6:39:45] <ape_hawk> newman!
[6:40:08] <%Valdorick> Goddamn
[6:40:08] <%Brassnarwhal> @sinisterbroccoli do you remember the month it took people to find Artorias & The Abyss?
[6:40:10] <sjcodan> BURN, BURN BURN
[6:40:10] <%livi242> man weapon arts are busted in this aren't they
[6:40:14] <%luftraumm1> that art of war is fucked up
[6:40:16] <TwistParabola> the cheese
[6:40:23] <%X2Eliah> rot buoldup
[6:40:24] <+leviting> is that just an asylum demon?
[6:40:25] <buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut> Wow
[6:40:25] <%X2Eliah> yooo
[6:40:30] <SinisterBroccoli> @Brassnarwhal I love it
[6:40:31] <@QueequegTheater> @leviting ye
[6:40:38] <+anoldtoilet> a slab just laying in the street
[6:40:38] <%fanciful_fright> @swesterly my take on Ranni's stuff was guiding souls via the moon, to transcend the current shitty world into a better form. Basically Bloodborne squid baby style, but less lovecraftian.
[6:40:46] <TwistParabola> left
[6:40:54] <%Valdorick> Between that weapon art and the one you get at the end of the game (and Horafrost stomp), yeah, weapon arts are busted this game.
[6:41:04] <RubberFistFight> @QueequegTheater in fairness i've been here since basically the same age i started to talk, so you'd be forgiven for not knowing. But I consider myself Welsh before Australian and just go with the Aussie assumption unless it becomes relevant.
[6:41:05] <%Felhad> RIP
[6:41:05] <%livi242> I'm glad this game isn't as boringly balanced as DS3 was
[6:41:07] <%Brassnarwhal> @sinisterbroccoli i expect people to discover a new ending 5 years from now
[6:41:11] <%NBUsagi> WTF is that 0w 0
[6:41:17] <+Grayhammatter> oh no, these assholes
[6:41:29] <Vermillion129> Just heal them Kappa
[6:41:29] <+anoldtoilet> @Brassnarwhal there is a lot of speculation theres one more ending thats just REALLY hidden
[6:41:30] <boostergoldz> those are the worst enemies in the game
[6:41:31] <+Edrem> any aoe healing can instantly stun these guys
[6:41:33] <DuckAlfred> BRO
[6:41:34] <%Brassnarwhal> @livi242 i love ds3, but i also agree wholeheartedly
[6:41:36] <+anoldtoilet> connected to nepheli loux and rykard
[6:41:37] <+imthinkingdarbys> lol
[6:41:38] <sothatsprettybrutal> wow he took a long time to notice you
[6:41:39] <SinisterBroccoli> @Brassnarwhal Definitely something big at least
[6:41:40] <+swesterly> @Brassnarwhal they have confirmed there is an ending people haven't found yet i believe
[6:41:40] <it_came_from_outer_space> you've been dilligent
[6:41:43] <%pinkslimegoblin> got damn
[6:41:45] <TwistParabola> yeah
[6:41:47] <tolloponik> those things can die in a fire
[6:41:48] <%Brassnarwhal> @edrem that's sick
[6:41:50] <SinnerEbru> oooh fashion ring
[6:41:51] <TwistParabola> you're diligent
[6:42:00] <%Brassnarwhal> @swesterly so at least 1 then
[6:42:03] <sjcodan> The ouchie-seal
[6:42:05] <Vermillion129> it's weird how late this is compare to radagon soreseal
[6:42:11] <@QueequegTheater> @Brassnarwhal Unless there's an interview source, I call BS. People have platinumed it already
[6:42:12] <Vermillion129> AND behind a swordseal wall
[6:42:29] <Sunstalker> Not even worth equipping this late with the dmg they dish out
[6:42:30] <gryffinp> those things are so fucked up
[6:42:30] <%Valdorick> There's many thing here that are baffling they're this late.
[6:42:34] <%EldritchBee> There's a reason why you can summon in this little area
[6:42:34] <%X2Eliah> man those guys suck
[6:42:34] <+alphonseisbest> wait what did pat just pick up?
[6:42:34] <%NBUsagi> oh thats a Bloodborne
[6:42:36] <%DashXero> Jesus. That guy was PISSED.
[6:42:38] <thesaverofhumens> those things suck no matter what level apparently
[6:42:39] <%doc_ock_rokc> I HATE those things
[6:42:40] <some_brave_apollo> fuck this area
[6:42:40] <%furiousfurioso> I want to know what the deal is with these freaks, why are they all over
[6:42:41] <+Murimlol> mimic time
[6:42:41] <TwistParabola> hate these dudes
[6:42:41] <boostergoldz> that gap clear is ridiculous
[6:42:45] <boostergoldz> and it teleports
[6:42:45] <ohno58> with the Honda hands
[6:42:47] <jacksawjack> Ah the multiarmed fuck horse
[6:42:50] <%Valdorick> There is for SURE going to be mods made to give you some of the stuff from this dungeon earlier
[6:42:53] <%Monkeyweed21> you can just heal on those dudes
[6:42:55] <SinnerEbru> thats like the water boiler keeper in spirited away
[6:42:56] <+swesterly> @Brassnarwhal yeah tbf it's jsut hearsay i don't have a source there, though they could easily not tie that ending to a trophy
[6:42:56] <$drabberfaun535> im not a fan of that kind of enemy design
[6:42:59] <%Brassnarwhal> @queequegtheater i still think there will be a new ending found in 5 years, never trust from to not hide it so well that there are no achievements
[6:42:59] <%xcompleasedad> It's like a Torch Enemy, but it doesn't hit you with a torch. It hits you with ACTUAL attacks
[6:43:00] <bassoontyphoon> How is that a fun enemy type
[6:43:02] <no123450n> one of those teabagged me to death
[6:43:05] <RubberFistFight> @Brassnarwhal maybe they outdid themselves on the stupid convoluted bullshit required to trigger the ending
[6:43:11] <+swesterly> you could get here pretty quickly actually
[6:43:14] <Sunstalker> @Brassnarwhal Not all the endings are trophies but yeah, they're already datamining the game. We'd know already
[6:43:17] <Evendrag> did anyone watch the picard show?
[6:43:17] <@QueequegTheater> @Brassnarwhal Or it requires DLC
[6:43:30] <@QueequegTheater> no
[6:43:30] <Evendrag> or is it a movie? keep getting ads
[6:43:32] <+anoldtoilet> yeah it may just be cut content that will be dlc
[6:43:32] <sjcodan> OIC
[6:43:40] <+anoldtoilet> picard is bad
[6:43:44] <+anoldtoilet> its sad
[6:43:44] <%cade_calrayn> Ahhh welcome to the Haligtree
[6:43:45] <RubberFistFight> @Brassnarwhal actually yeah that could be it, since platinum = gotten all the trophies that are currently gettable, yeah?
[6:43:47] <sothatsprettybrutal> "you haven't discovered it yet because we haven't made it yet, technically accurate"
[6:43:49] <@QueequegTheater> No, Pat, it's pronounced "D L C"
[6:43:51] <Evendrag> is it?
[6:43:52] <+anoldtoilet> but hey let my man get paid
[6:43:52] <TwistParabola> LUL
[6:43:52] <%cade_calrayn> How goes the exploration
[6:43:54] <sjcodan> LOCAL MAN CHUGS EVERY POTION BUT THE ONE HE MEANT TO
[6:43:57] <+ArmoredDeath> hggShaq
[6:43:57] <%rosysyntax> Picard is atrociously bad
[6:43:58] <SinnerEbru> NICE
[6:44:00] <%Brassnarwhal> @sunstalker people are very confidently wrong all the time, we shall see, dlc is a valid guess from queequeg tho
[6:44:01] <%EldritchBee> holy shit I didn't know that was survivable
[6:44:04] <no123450n> parkour
[6:44:04] <$OfficerMods> ding ding
[6:44:06] <TwistParabola> nice
[6:44:13] <Evendrag> THAT bad huhh?
[6:44:13] <%nip_nips> oh lawd, this spot
[6:44:14] <%cade_calrayn> ugh these fucking things
[6:44:16] <%fanciful_fright> @Brassnarwhal Thats my thought. Theres a hint for a possible further ending, but no interactions that could really result in it. DLC or cut content is a safe bet.
[6:44:22] <WillSin4Cash> there's multiple variations for the basic ending which all give the same achievment/trophy so there could be another one potentially
[6:44:24] <Sunstalker> Pat, could slap the health and mana flasks on the Triangle quickselect left/right instead?
[6:44:27] <%NBUsagi> Oh these things suck ass
[6:44:29] <%nip_nips> i hate this enemy type the most
[6:44:29] <%Monkeyweed21> @rosysyntax even the ads show how badly they understand Star Trek
[6:44:31] <sjcodan> I didnt even fight these things, I just ran
[6:44:33] <%Brassnarwhal> @sjcodan subsequently dies of thirst in about 20 minutes
[6:44:41] <Baeltyr> why not pat, why not
[6:44:41] <Vermillion129> huh, the weapon arts go up the wall?
[6:44:41] <some_brave_apollo> to punish you for exploring
[6:44:42] <boostergoldz> it makes the horrific and loud pus of man sounds too
[6:44:46] <%DashXero> That's an interesting question.
[6:44:47] <%doc_ock_rokc> THOSE ARE GHOSTS
[6:44:47] <MartyFun11> You can also hold down the button to switch directly to the estus
[6:44:49] <%EldritchBee> These aren't grafted, they're Nobles
[6:44:50] <%luftraumm1> i find it weird too
[6:44:53] <%xcompleasedad> To kill you?
[6:44:54] <V0LK__> the extra ending stuff, I saw a tweet from a famous dataminer saying it wasn't implemented, so probably will be DLC stuff
[6:44:55] <%doc_ock_rokc> not grafted
[6:44:56] <Evendrag> cuz the Ad is just Q saying some shit
[6:44:57] <%Heart_of_Gold9000> Heart_of_Gold9000 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 30 months, currently on a 30 month streak! keep doin it dood
[6:45:00] <TheSandmanIsHere> "because fuck you, that's why"
[6:45:01] <%rosysyntax> @Monkeyweed21 yupppp. The only good thing to come out of it is the Red Letter Media videos. The suffering is delicious.
[6:45:01] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> because fuck you
[6:45:03] <sjcodan> ????
[6:45:06] <+anoldtoilet> are they grafted or primordial crucible guys
[6:45:07] <%EldritchBee> They're in the Shaded Castle
[6:45:08] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt those arent grafted they're revenants
[6:45:10] <ohno58> what?
[6:45:11] <sjcodan> Bight town was all wood and scafolding
[6:45:16] <%Maids4lyfe> golden order is corrupt probably
[6:45:17] <+swesterly> you could sprint here right away actually, the only thing you need to do is grab the rold medallion from liurnia, warp to volcano from academy, beat morgott, beat castle sol, and beat loretta
[6:45:18] <%EldritchBee> Which has deep ties to Malenia
[6:45:19] <%cade_calrayn> These things are like, naturally born
[6:45:23] <%xcompleasedad> Blighttown, but NOT covered in shit and piss and death.
[6:45:23] <%cade_calrayn> they're not artificial
[6:45:28] <Baeltyr> same thing
[6:45:29] <sjcodan> This is NOTHING like blighttown
[6:45:29] <%Brassnarwhal> @queequegtheater or maybe they just stealth patch an ending in peacemeal or all at once inside another patch
[6:45:31] <%SveriSageAdvice> oh my god you're right, it absolutely is blighttown and the giant tree place
[6:45:35] <$drabberfaun535> mabye these guys would be more fair if you had real poise in this game
[6:45:36] <Mitchellsocks> @xcompleasedad Yes but also no
[6:45:36] <%luftraumm1> ??
[6:45:36] <TheSandmanIsHere> these are probably what Godrick was imitating
[6:45:38] <RubberFistFight> @rosysyntax yeah. seems this season is shaping up to be "patrick stewart explores his childhood trauma" since this is the first we've heard of Picard having an abusive childhood (like patrick stewart did). Oh well. At least after years of being wasted on Voyager, John DeLancie has shown he still remembers how to do Scary Q properly.
[6:45:41] <%Monkeyweed21> its just a Yokai
[6:45:43] <%cade_calrayn> Yeah, the arms and tail aren't added on
[6:45:44] <@QueequegTheater> @Brassnarwhal "Made several changes"
[6:45:46] <Sunstalker> OH so THESE are the fuckers that dmg from HEALING SPELLS?
[6:45:58] <$HeyItsSirBanana> I love the little grabby hands on the sword
[6:45:58] <+Tredecian> i think they might be a pile of corpses rather than grafted
[6:46:00] <+anoldtoilet> @drabberfaun535 this game does have poise you just need really really high poise stats
[6:46:05] <+Edrem> any healing will basically wipe them out instantly
[6:46:06] <%Brassnarwhal> @queequegtheater updated localization files is my favorite
[6:46:06] <sjcodan> CAST REVIVE ON SKELETON
[6:46:07] <%cade_calrayn> This area is a maze, yeah, it can take some time
[6:46:07] <%SveriSageAdvice> there is no way to grab all the paths the first time lmao
[6:46:10] <+theoldone001> After playing this game Blighttown seems like a stroll through Disney Park, going back won't be the same lol
[6:46:12] <thesaverofhumens> the undead are weak to healing'
[6:46:13] <Mitchellsocks> Yeah, easily most frustrating enemy in the game
[6:46:25] <Vermillion129> ohhh nooooo
[6:46:29] <no123450n> hit him with the stones
[6:46:30] <%dekkitout> SPEEN
[6:46:32] <$drabberfaun535> @drabberfaun535 even with max poise you still get one touch staggered
[6:46:33] <gryffinp> hope you're ready for normal enemy crystarians
[6:46:34] <%NBUsagi> SPEEEEEN
[6:46:35] <pi_in_the_sci> SLUG
[6:46:36] <boostergoldz> you need like 60 poise to start noticing anything
[6:46:44] <%Call_Me_Deacon_Blues> strike damage
[6:46:47] <%Brassnarwhal> if only i had shield bash
[6:46:47] <RyuuAoi> This fucker
[6:46:51] <senfood> FIGHT BACK
[6:46:53] <sjcodan> Poise depends on the weapon you're using
[6:46:53] <SinisterBroccoli> Tear is fading
[6:47:03] <%xcompleasedad> @RubberFistFight Isn't Picard's mom ALIVE in an episode? Like, we SEE her, as a 75-year-old woman, but she was alive. Did they just forget that?
[6:47:04] <%Maids4lyfe> god I hate it here
[6:47:09] <V0LK__> criticals seems barely useful in this game, when enemies stagger I just spam my ash of war
[6:47:11] <tolloponik> is this just a gauntlet of the most annoying enemies?
[6:47:12] <sjcodan> If you're using a great axe, even 20~ poise is enough to tank a hit
[6:47:13] <RyuuAoi> Wombo Combo
[6:47:14] <%strakillias> Would rocks work better to break these guys?
[6:47:21] <some_brave_apollo> lol
[6:47:22] <%X2Eliah> Picards mom is obviously the Borg Queen
[6:47:25] <%cade_calrayn> Y'all.... I just found out that my boyfriend has 14,000 unread emails
[6:47:29] <+Nomenanza> nop
[6:47:30] <+anoldtoilet> @RubberFistFight probably? they dont seem to really care about continuity
[6:47:32] <%DashXero> But wait. There's more.
[6:47:36] <Vermillion129> it's a crafting material and you know it pat
[6:47:37] <+Tredecian> it wont
[6:47:37] <%cade_calrayn> he says there are also even more inboxes I haven't seen
[6:47:37] <%rosysyntax> Narrator: It didn't slap.
[6:47:37] <ohno58> red leaf lol
[6:47:38] <Baeltyr> rune (1)
[6:47:41] <sjcodan> @cade_calrayn Yeah, and?
[6:47:42] <RustyQuarters> JUMP HIM
[6:47:42] <%nip_nips> @sjcodan literally ANY attack would knock me out of my attack while swinging dual colossal swords in medium armor
[6:47:42] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> I beelined through this whole area,
[6:47:44] <%Valdorick> Hope you're ready for a Hero Soul [2]
[6:47:46] <%Brassnarwhal> rock spell?
[6:47:47] <SinisterBroccoli> it never does
[6:47:49] <+Tredecian> i dont know what it is but it wont
[6:47:59] <RubberFistFight> @RubberFistFight Nope. That was his GRANDMA, and it was during the first episode with The Traveller where they went to a place in the universe where thoughts influenced reality. She appeared in the corridor and offered him tea, because for some reason he was thinking about her.
[6:48:00] <SinisterBroccoli> yeah worth
[6:48:02] <SuperBloodWolfMoon> somber 9's not bad
[6:48:15] <%luftraumm1> ooo read that
[6:48:19] <sjcodan> Yes
[6:48:19] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> this is postgame pretty much
[6:48:21] <gryffinp> It feels like dlc
[6:48:22] <%cade_calrayn> it's the edge of the world
[6:48:23] <%Brassnarwhal> @nip_nips armor gives poise and if you are desperate the deathbed maidens buff gives you poise if you consume it
[6:48:24] <%cade_calrayn> it kind of is
[6:48:25] <+Nomenanza> it is THE hardest zone yes
[6:48:26] <TwistParabola> it is
[6:48:27] <%MisterRockett> Why we still playing this GARBAGE when the Strangers of Paradise demo is out?
[6:48:30] <RubberFistFight> His mother has actually never been referenced in the series before directly. His FATHER appeared during the episode where he got shot in the heart and died, and Q appeared to give him a second chance.
[6:48:33] <sjcodan> it is
[6:48:34] <%xcompleasedad> @X2Eliah The only way she's not, is if the Borg are fucking with him, and making him forget his mom died 15 years ago. Which could be smart.
[6:48:37] <%EldritchBee> This place feels more like a Final Area than the actual Final Area
[6:48:38] <%NBUsagi> Yeah this feels like your supposed to come here after beating the game
[6:48:40] <SinisterBroccoli> That weapon art doesn't use a ton of FP too
[6:48:44] <%rosysyntax> @MisterRockett CHAOS
[6:48:46] <%Brassnarwhal> @misterrockett who?
[6:48:47] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> i would imagine most come here after the final boss
[6:48:49] <RyuuAoi> Boss rush ha
[6:48:55] <%Valdorick> Yeah, this is 'Post Game'
[6:48:59] <TheHotStuven> Memek getting skewered
[6:49:06] <42nfl19> @PatStaresAt IDK, this place looks too pretty to be the end of the game. Aren't all end boss fights in souls game all bleak and dank?
[6:49:09] <%Brassnarwhal> that grab was sick
[6:49:13] <%xcompleasedad> @RubberFistFight Oh, so THAT'S why she was old. My bad.
[6:49:14] <RubberFistFight> @X2Eliah There's no way they could make that kind of "plot twist" remotely intelligent or respecting of previous canon. It couldn't even be called a hail mary because of how pants-on-head it would be.
[6:49:16] <+Glidemusic> mimic tears are the best
[6:49:18] <%luftraumm1> son't even care just spam that fire studff
[6:49:21] <+swesterly> i usually save forge and onward for last
[6:49:22] <Vermillion129> tons the monster here have been bosses before
[6:49:26] <Sunstalker> I wish we had a nice magma sword then the fucking throatscraper of rykard
[6:49:30] <%luftraumm1> woa you got their sowrd
[6:49:33] <sothatsprettybrutal> can you keep playing after the end without ng+ing?
[6:49:33] <%fanciful_fright> Wow, Rykards sword is just better than the Dark Moon Greatsword, huh?
[6:49:40] <sothatsprettybrutal> i'm assuming no?
[6:49:45] <%Brassnarwhal> sparkle
[6:49:47] <RubberFistFight> @RubberFistFight all good. I'm a giant, GIANT trek nerd so I remember this shit 😅
[6:49:51] <@QueequegTheater> @sothatsprettybrutal yes
[6:49:53] <%luftraumm1> gregg is on point you're just following
[6:49:54] <+OneTrueAsshat> You can yeah
[6:49:54] <gryffinp> ghost clone go poof
[6:50:00] <RickyRelucent> Anor Londo?
[6:50:01] <+swesterly> @fanciful_fright yes, it heals and the weapon art with flame grant me strength is op as fuck
[6:50:03] <rosabellamelantha> I just spent way too much time checking and double checking literally every single source relating to the dark moon and not a single one even implies it's a god, just had to make sure of that so yeah no
[6:50:05] <sothatsprettybrutal> well that's what assumptions get you i guess
[6:50:08] <%X2Eliah> i think you are going backwards from the "intended" path
[6:50:08] <%Brassnarwhal> sporkle
[6:50:09] <TheSandmanIsHere> @fanciful_fright depends on your build
[6:50:12] <RyuuAoi> You're mowing though
[6:50:12] <rosabellamelantha> yes
[6:50:13] <%Felhad> different and fth scaling
[6:50:15] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> yes
[6:50:17] <%X2Eliah> a lot of the messages make sense going in reverse
[6:50:20] <%fanciful_fright> @sothatsprettybrutal You totally can. NG+ is accessed via the roundtable
[6:50:20] <%Valdorick> Correct
[6:50:20] <oda_flobunaga> Vraismenty
[6:50:21] <+anoldtoilet> @X2Eliah making it intelligent or respecting canon dont seem to be even remotely close to the goals of the people making star trek in 2022
[6:50:22] <%luftraumm1> ashes lore?
[6:50:25] <TwistParabola> mostly
[6:50:27] <TheSandmanIsHere> @rickyrelucent this and the capital are what they wanted Anor Londo to be
[6:50:28] <%EldritchBee> This is a side way to get to progress
[6:50:28] <+swesterly> @fanciful_fright although the big difference is projectiles on dmgs are free after imbued so the fp cost is higher on rykard
[6:50:31] <%Valdorick> The point all the ballista are point is progress
[6:50:32] <gryffinp> LET US USE THE BALLISTAE
[6:50:34] <RustyQuarters> Sounds about Souls game
[6:50:34] <Vermillion129> up is actually progress
[6:50:36] <%EldritchBee> because fuck this next encounter
[6:50:38] <boostergoldz> darkmoon greatsword unfortunately needs the buff for sword beams and that buff has a long animation
[6:50:40] <+anoldtoilet> trek is now bad mass effect fanfic its not even star trek fanfic
[6:50:40] <%cade_calrayn> Yeah, the building you're looking at is progress, Pat
[6:50:45] <RickyRelucent> double jump gap
[6:50:47] <RickyRelucent> get horsie?
[6:50:49] <+Tredecian> below ypu
[6:50:50] <RickyRelucent> oh nvm
[6:50:50] <Vermillion129> that door is progress
[6:50:52] <sothatsprettybrutal> just felt like whatever you do at the end should like fundamentally change the world so continuing wouldn't make sense
[6:50:54] <+anoldtoilet> nice
[6:51:05] <%Valdorick> +2 faith helm!
[6:51:06] <TwistParabola> haha, it does seem familiar
[6:51:07] <%EldritchBee> Ladder left
[6:51:11] <%luftraumm1> @PatStaresAt read the lore for the haligtree ashes too
[6:51:13] <%NBUsagi> Whats with these guys and unalloyed gold?
[6:51:13] <%strakillias> Increases fatih huh?
[6:51:19] <+swesterly> no
[6:51:23] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> no
[6:51:26] <%fanciful_fright> Sideways moonlight greatsword beams also break on most collision. Can't use them in alot of places, its sad to me.
[6:51:27] <+Tredecian> nope
[6:51:27] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> well yes, but actually no
[6:51:28] <+swesterly> the other door actually
[6:51:29] <Sunstalker> @NBUsagi its helps with rot
[6:51:29] <TwistParabola> no
[6:51:31] <%Valdorick> No, THAT door is decoration.
[6:51:37] <Omenaire_> holy shit there are a lot of summons
[6:51:39] <+swesterly> the lavish door is lavish but alas you don't have the right
[6:51:39] <sothatsprettybrutal> won't catch me alloying any gold. couldn't be me
[6:51:43] <RickyRelucent> are these the guys plague drew
[6:51:47] <RickyRelucent> they look like it
[6:51:53] <%fanciful_fright> @NBUsagi Unalloyed gold staves off scarlet rot
[6:51:55] <thesaverofhumens> kamikaze soldiers
[6:51:56] <%cade_calrayn> Oh, so the Haligtree wasn't like that before Miquella was kidnapped?
[6:51:57] <%luftraumm1> so these guys didn't know they were bombs?
[6:51:59] <%cade_calrayn> Huh
[6:52:01] <%NBUsagi> @NBUsagi ohhhh
[6:52:01] <Baeltyr> @Omenaire_  and like 7 of them are good
[6:52:04] <Sunstalker> Pretty much every enemy aside from like tree monsters are summons
[6:52:06] <%X2Eliah> looks like it
[6:52:07] <Vermillion129> are you sure Kappa
[6:52:07] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Pat is using Soul Edge lol

[6:53:02] <TwistParabola> rotted
[6:53:04] <RickyRelucent> GGs

[6:53:05] <oda_flobunaga> can you though?
[6:53:07] <RubberFistFight> yeah this one's uh

[6:53:08] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> i mean the grace is there
[6:53:08] <%DEETRz> fuckin rot
[6:53:09] <RubberFistFight> super great
[6:53:09] <Strigiform> of course its a rot tree
[6:53:15] <%cade_calrayn> @Monkeyweed21 you mean Mohg kidnapping Miquella? Basically yeah
[6:53:17] <$realm_forge> Asylum demon says hi
[6:53:23] <Vermillion129> you cant fight it outside too LUL
[6:53:31] <%cade_calrayn> calling an eternal child his "lover" and "consort" is fucked up
[6:53:31] <%Valdorick> Oh damn, you have 250K souls
[6:53:39] <%Call_Me_Deacon_Blues> Asylum Treemon
[6:53:39] <+Tredecian> nice
[6:53:46] <%Monkeyweed21> @cade_calrayn yea Mohg ruined shit for this whole place
[6:53:47] <boostergoldz> these knights fuck
[6:53:48] <%luftraumm1> haev you already read the lord's rune?
[6:53:56] <gryffinp> two of these guys AND the tree AND the ballista shooting you
[6:53:57] <gryffinp> madness
[6:54:02] <%furiousfurioso> wow I wish I knew I could get behind it because fighting it with these fuckers in the arena sucked
[6:54:04] <RickyRelucent> @Call_Me_Deacon_Blues rexgun2Laugh
[6:54:10] <%rosysyntax> brutal
[6:54:10] <%cade_calrayn> @Monkeyweed21 I never read the ashes so I didn't realize that the Haligtree wasn't intentionally rotted
[6:54:10] <tolloponik> Magic?!
[6:54:12] <+swesterly> the numen rune description is also pretty important
[6:54:13] <%fanciful_fright> @SveriSageAdvice Mohg was creepy about Miquella, cut him out of a tree and stole him. Personally I think its a very weird worship/devotion thing rather than sexual.
[6:54:14] <%luftraumm1> these guys have everything
[6:54:14] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> tree bois makin noise
[6:54:15] <%cade_calrayn> that's actually really interesting
[6:54:16] <%NBUsagi> This game runs the bracket on knights i have to give them, you get wind knights, ice knights, holy knights, and all sorts
[6:54:21] <%strakillias> Greg took a hot minute to turn around and fight
[6:54:21] <RyuuAoi> Help?
[6:54:22] <Evendrag> this is the place
[6:54:23] <Vermillion129> ya, imagine fighting that urdtree avatar out there LUL
[6:54:25] <%NBUsagi> Rot Knights
[6:54:30] <TwistParabola> you were saying something about the soldiers not being good?
[6:54:37] <%DEETRz> you can actually bait that erdtree in front of the ballistas and it'll chunk him
[6:54:38] <%cade_calrayn> @fanciful_fright he specifically calls Miquella his consort and lover
[6:54:39] <Varanoo> The Golden Order just seems to be an interplanetary system of Godhood if each tree in the finalboss is representative of a world each, while Ranni's ending is her desire to be fully sovereign and it's just her setting herself up as God but independent of the Golden Order system.  Overall things seem to have gone bad because Marika messed up herself and not due to any inherent flaw of the G.O. system at all
[6:54:48] <%cade_calrayn> so without Miquella's influence, Malenia's rot just fucked up the whole tree, didn't it
[6:54:50] <+MarkoTolstov> @fanciful_fright nah it explicitly says he wanted to share his bedchamber with him
[6:54:53] <RickyRelucent> Think he just wanted Pat to realise they're free dmg
[6:54:54] <%Valdorick> @SveriSageAdvice He's literally in his Bedchamber! He wanted to be his consort! AN ITEM SAYS "CONSECRATE THEIR UNION"
[6:54:57] <@QueequegTheater> @SveriSageAdvice One of the item descriptions say Mohg shared his bedchambers with Miquella's corpse
[6:55:03] <%Monkeyweed21> @cade_calrayn the rot is because Miquella is here sans unalloyed gold needle, so shes spewing rot uncontrollably and without Miquella here to make a new needle shits fucked
[6:55:03] <TwistParabola> yep
[6:55:05] <RickyRelucent> the summon, i mean
[6:55:05] <%fanciful_fright> @cade_calrayn Never found that bit of lore. Ick.
[6:55:07] <no123450n> slappo
[6:55:08] <%Valdorick> Consummate*
[6:55:08] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> So...The Erdtree was a better spin off of the Hali tree
[6:55:08] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> o you dont have the right
[6:55:09] <+Esquinn> ORAORAORAORAORA
[6:55:10] <%DashXero> Jesus.
[6:55:12] <RickyRelucent> fucking spider
[6:55:16] <Sunstalker> These guys suck so much ass.
[6:55:18] <boostergoldz> miquella was the one keeping it from rotting right? since he's basically human unalloyed gold?
[6:55:23] <+Nomenanza> and that is the main reason I fucking despise that enemy
[6:55:23] <xDartuzax> Very cool enemy design
[6:55:23] <oda_flobunaga> So overlevel much WOW
[6:55:27] <ianweatherell> pat you're the reason I got into souls games
[6:55:29] <sothatsprettybrutal> tarnished can't climb the back sides of ladders, their one curse
[6:55:30] <$realm_forge> Ora Ora Ora
[6:55:30] <Midnight188> forgot which end of the ladder was climbable
[6:55:31] <%cade_calrayn> yeah the revenants are the WORST
[6:55:44] <+swesterly> @Monkeyweed21 miquella isn't here though
[6:55:47] <RickyRelucent> 120 is actually a safe lvl to stop at, and the softcaps are higher this time around
[6:55:49] <+leviting> why are they Like That
[6:55:50] <%Monkeyweed21> @boostergoldz Miquella made the unalloyed needle specifically to help Malenia contain the rot
[6:55:52] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> rip runes
[6:55:53] <%Brassnarwhal> summon to distract?
[6:55:54] <%cade_calrayn> *F*
[6:55:54] <%Valdorick> Oh my god
[6:55:56] <%luftraumm1> well
[6:55:57] <Vermillion129> welp 270k gone
[6:55:59] <%Monkeyweed21> @swesterly sorry I meant Malenia

[6:56:03] <TwistParabola> F
[6:56:04] <Boombay1213> I had paralysis demon dream with those guys
[6:56:04] <TheSandmanIsHere> because Miquella wasn't penetrating her with his tiny golden needle, Malenia rotted
[6:56:04] <+Tredecian> this enemy slaps
[6:56:05] <RubberFistFight> welcome to the haligtree
[6:56:08] <+Tredecian> literally
[6:56:09] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> It didnt even follow the first time. Thats bullshit

[6:56:12] <2deep5u> this place seems serious
[6:56:13] <%twohitgood> how much do levels cost RN?
[6:56:14] <+RealMichaelPhelps> alriiiiiight
[6:56:21] <$realm_forge> Go Greg go
[6:56:21] <RubberFistFight> pretty sure i heard that arm spider yell "WELCOME TO REVACHOL" too
[6:56:21] <SinisterBroccoli> Have you been to Farum Azula yet?
[6:56:24] <%cade_calrayn> @TheSandmanIsHere Miquella's a kid, so ew.
[6:56:25] <%xcompleasedad> Is it to the point that you feel like leveling is meaningless? @PatStaresAt
[6:56:28] <2deep5u> boletaria'd
[6:56:30] <%luftraumm1> fuckiiiing arteria leaf
[6:56:37] <Sunstalker> Garbage like that is why I'm considering slapping the raven feathers art onto a side arm just to never get hit by shit while running throough
[6:56:37] <boostergoldz> yes but he also resists the influences of the outer gods. it's why gideon says mohg's efforts are fruitless.
[6:56:42] <%cade_calrayn> @SinisterBroccoli he visited it briefly from the telporter but that's it
[6:56:45] <Vermillion129> @RickyRelucent mind has no diminishing returns and damage stat cap is like 80 in this game
[6:56:46] <+Rigid_Digidi> what rune is that
[6:56:54] <%Call_Me_Deacon_Blues> it do go down
[6:56:56] <SinisterBroccoli> @cade_calrayn cool thank you
[6:57:02] <Vermillion129> @Rigid_Digidi mogh, dunno what it does tho
[6:57:03] <RustyQuarters> Zangief cam pls
[6:57:05] <RickyRelucent> Thanks for looking out @Vermillion129
[6:57:06] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> So is the Rot from the Haligtree?
[6:57:06] <%Aeoneth> did you get the ash above that room?
[6:57:07] <RyuuAoi> Mental mapped
[6:57:13] <$OfficerMods> zangief cam needed
[6:57:18] <+swesterly> @Call_Me_Deacon_Blues i said the same thing when i got here
[6:57:18] <TwistParabola> bullshit in 1, 2, 3
[6:57:20] <+LandOfTheWay> lmao
[6:57:22] <+Akizea> i like how chat evolved into lore talk now
[6:57:23] <it_came_from_outer_space> fuck that lol
[6:57:26] <+Tredecian> yoink chest
[6:57:26] <%Valdorick> Try Luring Out
[6:57:27] <TwistParabola> yeah
[6:57:32] <+Esquinn> Dung indeed
[6:57:34] <%X2Eliah> another rot dot?
[6:57:37] <coziestbank> Mind has dimishing returns at 52 the numbers are on the wiki
[6:57:37] <%luftraumm1> three spears???
[6:57:37] <RubberFistFight> it's pronounced "muh-LAY-knee-uh", if Ofnir's to be believed.
[6:57:38] <RyuuAoi> Gotta do it
[6:57:39] <ianweatherell> Boston Crystal Sword
[6:57:39] <%cade_calrayn> @PatStaresAt I believe they drop the Rotten Crystal Staff too
[6:57:41] <zenith0111> LUL
[6:57:41] <senfood> oh my god amazing get
[6:57:45] <%Aeoneth> It's a Cleanrot Knight Ash anyway
[6:57:46] <%Monkeyweed21> @boostergoldz is that because Miquella is naturally resistant like unallyed gold or because he's already the vessel for the Haligtree
[6:57:48] <%cade_calrayn> it's what I'm using
[6:57:48] <%Valdorick> Yeah, its a Scarlat Rot int weapon
[6:57:51] <+LandOfTheWay> @Akizea always was
[6:57:54] <+Nomenanza> there is even a collosal weapon that does rot
[6:57:55] <%X2Eliah> I mean yeah only clerics get the rot dragon breath
[6:57:59] <RickyRelucent> Bet tons of people finished the game by now, feels right for lore to be the topic
[6:58:03] <boostergoldz> I'm not sure.
[6:58:04] <%doc_ock_rokc> HOLY SHIT
[6:58:07] <%Call_Me_Deacon_Blues> @Call_Me_Deacon_Blues applicable to a lot of the game
[6:58:21] <%fanciful_fright> Can't complain about Rot weapons because a Madness weapon exists. PvP is a nightmare.
[6:58:24] <%pinkslimegoblin> it would be fun if there was a way to set twitch chat so that people can only talk in dark souls messages
[6:58:29] <$OfficerMods> alot of people have beaten the game but those people are freaks, MOST people haven't
[6:58:35] <%tsuchi7> tsuchi7 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months! i dont know twitch, what is this pop up that appears all the time
[6:58:35] <%Monkeyweed21> I beat Radahn without rot its not as bad as people made it seem
[6:58:38] <Sunstalker> I wish the dragon stuff had like elemental claws more, instead of just the one pair of claws and then dupes for every breathe
[6:58:38] <%whyskeywolfe> @PatStaresAt The next grace is the one with Milicent's quest beside it. Stop when you get there.
[6:58:39] <Vermillion129> where's a rot int katana so I can do rot bleed frost build
[6:58:40] <+swesterly> @RickyRelucent true, now it's time to start arguing about the vague lore and who is the best outer god waifu
[6:58:43] <%X2Eliah> Pat why are you upgrading your shields? does it do *anything*?
[6:58:47] <Giztech> i am a full faith build and still having no issues
[6:58:51] <%doc_ock_rokc> @pinkslimegoblin Try Fingers, But hole
[6:58:53] <%Brassnarwhal> keeps it simple, great strategy
[6:58:54] <sjcodan> @OfficerMods ??? I beat the game like over a week ago
[6:58:57] <%cade_calrayn> @PatStaresAt probably not worth fighting them, but they do drop the Rotten Crystal Staff if you beat them
[6:58:57] <+anoldtoilet> @X2Eliah you get a little more stability/guard boost
[6:58:58] <+anoldtoilet> over time
[6:59:01] <%Call_Me_Deacon_Blues> Newman...
[6:59:04] <%fanciful_fright> @X2Eliah buffs weapon ash
[6:59:05] <RickyRelucent> @OfficerMods Maybe they just watch and LP to know the way forward, plus ez magic
[6:59:09] <zenith0111> @x2eliah It helps with stamina
[6:59:10] <%Kiiper> @fanciful_fright Can't complain about madness weapons when a deathblight weapon exists lmao
[6:59:12] <Sunstalker> @X2Eliah ups guardbreak every few upgrades
[6:59:13] <Sigma_190_Beta> Numen are Aliens?
[6:59:14] <+swesterly> numen runes are found around ANTS
[6:59:18] <+anoldtoilet> why do those runes look more like eyes
[6:59:21] <SinisterBroccoli> anyone know if there are fire weapons that scale with int?
[6:59:22] <%X2Eliah> off it does? ok
[6:59:24] <TwistParabola> Numen are also a player background option!
[6:59:25] <%fanciful_fright> @Kiiper WHERE?!?!
[6:59:28] <RickyRelucent> can't wait for someone to do the first, fully invaded run
[6:59:29] <Sigma_190_Beta> IS MARIKA AN ANT?
[6:59:29] <%notsoy> do those mega-runes have no use beyond being turned into cash?
[6:59:30] <%ElkRiverDog> Normans. Got it.
[6:59:31] <thesaverofhumens> @anoldtoilet grant us eyes
[6:59:34] <Vermillion129> ohhhh this part
[6:59:35] <%X2Eliah> I tried the +1 and didnt see a guardbreak change, so
[6:59:37] <RustyQuarters> monkaS

[6:59:43] <+LandOfTheWay> @Sigma_190_Beta seem to just be humans from another land
[6:59:43] <boostergoldz> are you ready for another rot swamp
[6:59:44] <%DashXero> Woof.
[6:59:44] <%EldritchBee> @notsoy Only cash
[6:59:45] <sjcodan> Maybe why it needs a brace
[6:59:46] <%X2Eliah> oh wow yeah its just leaking ror
[6:59:46] <%cade_calrayn> this is technically the side tree
[6:59:46] <+Grayhammatter> jesus, ok
[6:59:48] <AtisutoCurry> HOLY SHIT
[6:59:48] <gryffinp> I'm honestly wondering if this tree was ever NOT rotted
[6:59:48] <TwistParabola> ROT EVERYWHERE
[6:59:49] <%X2Eliah> rot
[6:59:52] <%Call_Me_Deacon_Blues> I hope you have some anti rot bolbs
[6:59:52] <%cade_calrayn> It's not the tree proper
[6:59:54] <+lord_sykos> Can we burn down THIS tree instead?
[6:59:55] <%Kiiper> @fanciful_fright Castle Sol
[6:59:56] <%shootbang_exe> you can see the bottom from here too I think
[6:59:56] <senfood> Imagine getting powerful enough to become an Elden Lord but then you die and your soul becomes nothing but a nameless consumable item.
[6:59:57] <%Monkeyweed21> POISON SWAMP #53
[6:59:57] <%shootbang_exe> it's neat
[6:59:58] <+swesterly> THE EMPYREANS ARE COSMIC ANTS CRAWLING ALONG PARASITIC ERD TREES
[6:59:59] <zenith0111> Oh so the trees fucking dead?
[6:59:59] <tolloponik> thats some good maple syrup
[7:00:03] <$OfficerMods> @sjcodan i have too but again I'm just saying that people have beaten the game aleady are a small percentage of people who have played
[7:00:03] <V0LK__> tree dead inside FeelsBadMan
[7:00:04] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> This place is royally fucked
[7:00:09] <RubberFistFight> shitter's rotted
[7:00:12] <%Brassnarwhal> the brace is holding the tree together
[7:00:15] <%fanciful_fright> @Kiiper OH YEA, THE SHOTEL
[7:00:18] <%Fenrisulfr_V> I think Miquella is the only reason it wasn't already rotting out, and it died when Mogh stole him.
[7:00:20] <@DakotaMacDoodle> Get ready for Pain
[7:00:21] <%EldritchBee> @gryffinp According to items it was when Miquella was still there pre-shattering
[7:00:21] <%tsuchi7> has he done milicent questline?
[7:00:22] <%DashXero> Oh my god... These things are like Termites!
[7:00:24] <thesaverofhumens> ocean of rot

[7:01:01] <+anoldtoilet> LUL
[7:01:02] <$OfficerMods> ha ha can you imagine going through this area with a poision cure?
[7:01:02] <%Ironbuttz> got a dagger for dashing
[7:01:06] <RubberFistFight> if you used torrent he'd drown for sure
[7:01:06] <+LandOfTheWay> @Solid_Stro lore indicates he was really charming, to the point it was possibly a supernatural ability
[7:01:07] <zenith0111> How many journeys down to the core of the earth until we just foghr dinosaurs?
[7:01:08] <+Rigid_Digidi> if its that easy to cure scarlet rot why is caelid so fucked
[7:01:09] <Vermillion129> anyone else got tire of this swamp and grab a weapon with bloodhound step?

[7:01:19] <armadaofghosts> Is THIS the actual poison swamp of this game?
[7:01:27] <%fanciful_fright> @Solid_Stro Miquella was the most godly of Marika's descendants, super pure and perfect Elden canidate from what I recall.
[7:01:29] <boostergoldz> there are baby pests swimming around here
[7:01:30] <sjcodan> @OfficerMods On PC, 13% of people have unlocked the last boss, so its more than you think
[7:01:33] <Vermillion129> @RealMichaelPhelps can only walk in this swap unless backdash
[7:01:35] <%Fenrisulfr_V> Miyazaki snuck in one last miniature swamp. Just for us.
[7:01:38] <Evendrag> poison but worse

[7:01:54] <thesaverofhumens> thanks miyazaki
[7:01:55] <SinisterBroccoli> grab a dagger?
[7:01:55] <%luftraumm1> aomwonw auffered the sme as you
[7:01:57] <%nip_nips> @RealMichaelPhelps use dagger quickstep instead of backstep
[7:02:01] <Paranoid_Jumbotron> you dont have a weapon with quickstep?
[7:02:02] <+Tredecian> juvenile pests
[7:02:04] <%shootbang_exe> yeah baby bug boys
[7:02:04] <RickyRelucent> rexgun2Monk
[7:02:06] <TheSandmanIsHere> giant lice
[7:02:06] <halfmasks> try boulder
[7:02:07] <2deep5u> they look like the sewer bugmen from irithyll
[7:02:07] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt try quickstep
[7:02:09] <%Brassnarwhal> @sjcodan 13% of the entire playerbase is a lot of individuals but a timy minority
[7:02:09] <sjcodan> Use BLOODHOUND step
[7:02:11] <%ElkRiverDog> Wait, I was wrong: Numen. New Men.
[7:02:14] <zenith0111> DansGame
[7:02:15] <%Call_Me_Deacon_Blues> Their incest children?! Damming GRRM
[7:02:15] <boostergoldz> this is the only place you can find them i'm pretty sure
[7:02:17] <%imthewisejanitor> Kill them all, Patrick.
[7:02:17] <+swesterly> pests i think are rotted numen
[7:02:22] <%cade_calrayn> @PatStaresAt I believe this is actually the *side* of the tree, the city of Elphael was built along the side but the actual tree trunk is south of you
[7:02:25] <%shootbang_exe> you can range them out super easy though
[7:02:27] <$OfficerMods> When i did this i just walked at the very edge of the waterfall and sipped until i found a grace
[7:02:30] <+Tyk1337> Why does every Souls game, in the middle of the all the gorgeous environmental design and art direction, need a zone that just looks like total shit
[7:02:32] <%Valdorick> Pat *refuses* to quickstep
[7:02:33] <%fanciful_fright> Not their kids, just weird things that are born from rot
[7:02:34] <RickyRelucent> Podrick
[7:02:35] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt this is why the tree needs a brace I guess
[7:02:36] <Midnight188> i think is Numen as in Numinous like of the heavens.
[7:02:36] <+LandOfTheWay> @Solid_Stro goldwyn is actually the baldr stand in, like super explicitly
[7:02:36] <%cade_calrayn> but yes, the tree is fucked in general
[7:02:38] <Vermillion129> mistake has been made
[7:02:47] <%blankwaffle> I bet Jerry hates nueman
[7:02:58] <RickyRelucent> Potrick of House Flame, we fry em good!
[7:02:58] <Giztech> why no use dot heal?
[7:03:05] <%luftraumm1> throw rocks
[7:03:05] <SinisterBroccoli> What are the odds the ARC scaling weapons getting fixed?
[7:03:10] <boostergoldz> something something the good stuff shines better when you surround it with shit
[7:03:13] <+tkzhyon> Pat is a fellow blasphemous blade gang member? PogChamp

[7:03:30] <+AyupaPupa> 2 years from now
[7:03:40] <%cade_calrayn> @Monkeyweed21 nah, this city existed a long time before the tree rotted, I think
[7:03:41] <sjcodan> 2 years
[7:03:43] <Vermillion129> til DLC
[7:03:46] <+Rigid_Digidi> Elden ring Erd tree edition
[7:03:46] <+tussletoes> WOAH you are far into this aren't you oh god i gotta get out of here lol
[7:03:50] <@QueequegTheater> Don't be ridiculous, first we need to nerf Faith
[7:03:51] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> When the dlc come out
[7:03:52] <digaogrunge> Elden RIng Remastered
[7:03:55] <zenith0111> Tomorrow :)
[7:03:56] <RickyRelucent> this level progression man
[7:04:00] <RickyRelucent> jesus
[7:04:02] <+Edrem> I thought arcane scales the buildup not the damage itself
[7:04:03] <%DashXero> Should they not be buttmad?
[7:04:03] <%Valdorick> That jump is AMAZING
[7:04:05] <sjcodan> 2 more weeks
[7:04:07] <+Tredecian> down is grace
[7:04:08] <TwistParabola> :)
[7:04:08] <%EldritchBee> Get that grace!!!!
[7:04:08] <%fanciful_fright> Oh? Are ARC weapons not working well enough or are they too good? I haven't used an ARC build yet.
[7:04:11] <some_brave_apollo> go for grace
[7:04:13] <RickyRelucent> i'm 4 streams into this game and i still dunno what the fuck
[7:04:17] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> grace behind you
[7:04:20] <@QueequegTheater> @fanciful_fright Scaling is broken
[7:04:21] <TwistParabola> go for grace
[7:04:22] <%X2Eliah> arc weapons dont scale
[7:04:22] <%tsuchi7> can he just roll to get by faster, then just use a soap to stop the extra build up?
[7:04:22] <%NBUsagi> So wait wait, Miquella was a literal golden boy?
[7:04:25] <+Rofiarf> grace down there so maybe get that first
[7:04:28] <+Tredecian> down ladder for grace
[7:04:28] <%EldritchBee> @fanciful_fright Bleed is fantastic but Arc weapons don't scale right
[7:04:29] <+FZeroDMX> From went crazy with the jump button in this game
[7:04:30] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @fanciful_fright 2/3 of Arc weapons get no scaling.
[7:04:31] <42nfl19> @QueequegTheater My Faith is my Shield, my Fury is my Sword....buff everything else
[7:04:32] <+theoldone001> Pat go for Grace
[7:04:36] <+Tredecian> this is milli quqest
[7:04:36] <xanerts> I got real buttmad
[7:04:36] <+crimsonomen0> So when you guys both finish the game will you and woolie talk about the lore on the podcast? Because honestly what the fuck is even going on half the time.
[7:04:37] <oda_flobunaga> ARCane is SO Sick, but certain weapons have damage no scaling
[7:04:37] <Vermillion129> @fanciful_fright any arcane weapon that have multiple type of damage have 0 scaling
[7:04:38] <sirrice77> @fanciful_fright arc weapon scaling doesn't increase damage, only the status buildup
[7:04:38] <%EldritchBee> Get the grace
[7:04:39] <%furiousfurioso> you should get that grace
[7:04:39] <+swesterly> arc increases both damage and build up
[7:04:39] <%doc_ock_rokc> @fanciful_fright too good
[7:04:41] <+tkzhyon> what is this area?
[7:04:47] <+ATorL> @Edrem there's apparently a bug where weapons that have split damage and arcane scaling don't actually scale with anything
[7:04:47] <TwistParabola> there's Millicent's thing
[7:04:50] <%Call_Me_Deacon_Blues> grace that pole
[7:04:54] <%whyskeywolfe> @patstaresat And that's how you get to Milicent's quest area.
[7:04:56] <TwistParabola> yeah
[7:04:57] <+Rigid_Digidi> @tkzhyon Haligtree
[7:04:59] <Vermillion129> @tkzhyon Miquellas Haligtree
[7:05:01] <+Rofiarf> yeah
[7:05:01] <+Tredecian> no but you should
[7:05:10] <TwistParabola> ye
[7:05:14] <TwistParabola> well it's ideal
[7:05:18] <%fanciful_fright> Ahh okay, so most likely Arc weapons are going to get *stronger*
[7:05:21] <TwistParabola> you don't HAVE you
[7:05:24] <+tkzhyon> @Rigid_Digidi @Vermillion129 thanks
[7:05:24] <TwistParabola> to
[7:05:25] <+ScrapKingKeita> yep
[7:05:25] <%furiousfurioso> you don't have to get the grace first, you just really should
[7:05:26] <%fanciful_fright> YUP
[7:05:27] <+Rigid_Digidi> yes

[7:06:17] <%Valdorick> REVENGE!
[7:06:18] <%fanciful_fright> @sirrice77 Blasphemous Blade is actually prolly gonna be too slow to do well.
[7:06:18] <%boggsz12> 'pest' is a very fitting name for these enemies
[7:06:20] <sjcodan> I legit don't get how people had issues with her
[7:06:27] <%DashXero> Wasn't that grace supposed to be quest-related or something?
[7:06:29] <%Monkeyweed21> So they just PUT the Ringed City equivalent in the base game, wtf is the DLC gonna be?
[7:06:33] <%Call_Me_Deacon_Blues> they are shooting their ribs
[7:06:36] <@QueequegTheater> @sjcodan She's literally bugged to NG+ values
[7:06:37] <%Valdorick> @fanciful_fright The weapon art stun locks.
[7:06:39] <Midnight188> is there one more conversation with that girl we saw at the top of this city place?
[7:06:40] <sirrice77> @fanciful_fright When paired with mimic you can spam the weapon art to keep her on the floor
[7:06:41] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @sjcodan I didn't use or have any shields.
[7:06:43] <RickyRelucent> i like how they turned greatbow sniping into an actual enviromental hazard

[7:09:08] <%Call_Me_Deacon_Blues> not it, them
[7:09:08] <oda_flobunaga> Well, I'm doing a Faith Arc build and am at the final boss
[7:09:09] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt I can't wait for Woolie to face Malenia in September
[7:09:10] <senfood> I can absolutely believe you're at 111 hours. What I can't believe is that you haven't finished the map yet.

[7:12:26] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt when this finishes, since you ain't going Chaos you can safely kill her yourself for an absolutely OP talisman
[7:12:26] <%theeffay> pro gamer moves
[7:12:30] <%EldritchBee> IF YOU FALL ON HER YOU BREAK THE QUEST
[7:12:30] <%Valdorick> YEEEAH! BLASPHMOUS BLADE WINS AGAIN
[7:12:34] <Evendrag> @patstaresat dont hit her while jumping!!!!
[7:12:36] <%nip_nips> DONT DROP ON HER
[7:12:36] <%strakillias> Damn Mili pulled her weight there
[7:12:37] <ohno58> DON'T JUMP ON HER
[7:12:39] <zenith0111> EZ Clap

[7:12:56] <%EldritchBee> DO NOT fall on her
[7:12:59] <cthulu_fearlock> get out of my swamp!
[7:13:02] <some_brave_apollo> is Gowry their dad
[7:13:03] <%EldritchBee> COME FROM BELOW
[7:13:03] <RickyRelucent> the ring from the hippi ogre
[7:13:04] <%luftraumm1> who's gowry again?
[7:13:04] <%Cozy90> DONT JUMPO ON HER
[7:13:05] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt basically they were born asexually when she scarlet rotted all over caeild
[7:13:08] <%Cozy90> PAT BE CAREFUL
[7:13:08] <RickyRelucent> hippo*
[7:13:08] <Mitchellsocks> Gowry hit that
[7:13:10] <AtisutoCurry> DONT DO IT MAN
[7:13:10] <sjcodan> NO JUMPING
[7:13:10] <TwistParabola> careful
[7:13:11] <oda_flobunaga> Now you can kill her yourself
[7:13:16] <sjcodan> DO NOT JUMP
[7:13:19] <%SveriSageAdvice> no she literally dies if you drop on her @PatStaresAt
[7:13:24] <%Cozy90> she has less that 4 health
[7:13:26] <%NBUsagi> Oh so i read up on Miquella, apparently the stuff between him and Mohg is stil messed up but a lil less so? Basically Miquella was in a god coccoon and Mohg stole it. All of thate "Beseeching in his scarlet chambers" was him trying to basically coax Miquella out of the coccoon so they could ascent together
[7:13:28] <ohno58> So many people have accidently done myself included
[7:13:28] <oda_flobunaga> Kill
[7:13:29] <%SveriSageAdvice> and she DOESNT drop her stuff
[7:13:30] <pi_in_the_sci> she has 1 hp
[7:13:31] <V0LK__> game thinks you're mario and borks stuff easily
[7:13:33] <%fanciful_fright> Well, you don't break the quest, you just opt in to the other reward
[7:13:34] <+Nomenanza> considering they have had barriers for that entire reason before, it's baffling they dont now
[7:13:34] <SinisterBroccoli> it's kinda fucked up, but you get something way better for killing her
[7:13:40] <%NBUsagi> Also he isnt believed to be dead
[7:13:43] <%theeffay> Damn that sword looks spooky
[7:13:44] <TwistParabola> BibleThump
[7:13:57] <+mecha_11> level?
[7:13:58] <oda_flobunaga> She does Drop an OP Talisman
[7:13:58] <%cade_calrayn> @NBUsagi where'd you see that? I heard it as Mohg murdering him and putting him in a cocoon
[7:14:08] <%SveriSageAdvice> go back to reload the area, and come back for the needle
[7:14:13] <%imthewisejanitor> So no head?
[7:14:18] <%NBUsagi> @cade_calrayn The wiki and some lore items
[7:14:20] <%shootbang_exe> who could have forseen a fromsoft sidequest ending in tragedy
[7:14:24] <Ethel9727> @cade_calrayn Miquella went into the cocoon himself. It's not clear if he's dead or not now
[7:14:26] <+RushUnplugged> Miquella isn't dead so no, Mohg didn't murder him
[7:14:27] <%rosysyntax> time for a MERCY KILL
[7:14:29] <%radiorosewater> PogChamp
[7:14:29] <thesaverofhumens> reload time
[7:14:30] <Zebroneath> reload
[7:14:31] <rosabellamelantha> reset
[7:14:32] <%nip_nips> reload
[7:14:32] <+crimsonomen0> Every NPC in this game is bullshit. Every quest is you helping someone who tries to kill you.
[7:14:32] <%justcallmebobplease> Reload again
[7:14:33] <Lulu19> ya
[7:14:34] <+Tredecian> reload

[7:14:37] <%pabloelenano2> reload
[7:14:40] <%fanciful_fright> @cade_calrayn no, the cocoon is from Miquella growing the Haligtree
[7:14:40] <RickyRelucent> she wants to stay, let her stay
[7:14:42] <%Redsitza> I just did this part and accidentally landed on top of her with a jump, killing her instantly
[7:14:42] <%X2Eliah> leave and come back ya
[7:14:44] <TwistParabola> reload
[7:14:45] <+alphonseisbest> she big wifu
[7:14:46] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt you don't need the needle if you are not going chaos.  You can kill her for a cool item
[7:14:47] <coziestbank> If you would have killed her you would have got BOTH tailismans
[7:14:48] <+AyupaPupa> never
[7:14:49] <arkv01> why didnt you kiss her sugoiAwawa
[7:14:51] <+Rigid_Digidi> some things never change
[7:14:52] <+swesterly> @DashXero ayyyy Yo

[7:14:53] <boostergoldz> reload for the lore item, kill her for a good ring
[7:14:55] <+alphonseisbest> <3 <3 <3
[7:14:57] <TwistParabola> they do.
[7:14:58] <42nfl19> I mean they "expect" you to leave and come back after some time but WHO DOES THAT?
[7:14:59] <Profmcstevie> They've had over a decade, they refuse
[7:15:00] <+alphonseisbest> NotLikeThis SeemsGood
[7:15:00] <%NBUsagi> He made this tree that we are in right now to allow himself to transcend his curse and grow to adult hood and to purge the rot from Malenia but Mogh stole his coccoon before he could do that
[7:15:00] <artoflec> theres a lot they have to improve from like demon's souls and never did/will
[7:15:01] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> Miquella is super not dead, and is still incubating on the cocoon
[7:15:02] <+BubbaRands> HEY! YOU TWO SHOULD KISTH
[7:15:03] <@Spydurman> damn gameplay time at 112 hours?
[7:15:04] <sjcodan> READ NEEDLE
[7:15:07] <spinningchurro> You can save her.
[7:15:08] <+Nomenanza> Gowry in his shack has new dialogue
[7:15:11] <sothatsprettybrutal> unalloyed gang
[7:15:12] <spinningchurro> Forgot what item you need.
[7:15:13] <Khester824> SKIP TIME MECHANIC
[7:15:17] <arkv01> WITH A KISS <3
[7:15:17] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt you now have the first half of your "get-out clause" item if you wanted to check out what was behind the Scary Door.
[7:15:18] <%EldritchBee> You can't save her
[7:15:20] <+crimsonomen0> Do you need to reload or can you just fast travel?
[7:15:20] <+wizard_of_diamonds> No you can't.
[7:15:21] <%fanciful_fright> You can't save her
[7:15:21] <%cade_calrayn> No you can't
[7:15:23] <Sunstalker> I hate the reload shit and the non-linear quest locations for npc's. If you need the wiki to do stuff, it's not good enough
[7:15:24] <%rosysyntax> ZA WARUDO
[7:15:27] <TwistParabola> no?
[7:15:28] <%shootbang_exe> that sounds like bs @spinningchurro
[7:15:30] <+Rigid_Digidi> by not progressing the quest
[7:15:31] <ohno58> you can't
[7:15:31] <Sigma_190_Beta> No whoever said that is wrong.
[7:15:31] <%Monkeyweed21> with your penis
[7:15:32] <RickyRelucent> i do like how u can save/kill every npc
[7:15:32] <%Valdorick> psa1guy
[7:15:33] <@QueequegTheater> That's pure copium
[7:15:34] <TheSandmanIsHere> you can't
[7:15:34] <%Brassnarwhal> psa1guy
[7:15:36] <+joker626> as far as I know, you can't
[7:15:37] <spinningchurro> Ok well I guess you can’t.
[7:15:38] <RickyRelucent> rewards in every case
[7:15:38] <%Ynkubus_> the start of the quest is saving her
[7:15:41] <TwistParabola> if you can that's new info
[7:15:41] <RickyRelucent> no wrong options
[7:15:53] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> uno hombre
[7:15:54] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt the item you get for killing her is a talisman that gives 5 DEX and boosts consecutive attacks
[7:15:56] <Paranoid_Jumbotron> you cant save her, but i can
[7:16:03] <Zebroneath> If you end up killing her, you miss out on the needle, but get a Talisman that raises Dex and successive attck power.
[7:16:05] <%JustToWatch> "I can save her" say Pat who is worse
[7:16:07] <+Tredecian> gowry is a dumb bitch
[7:16:09] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> If you don't play the game she technically never dies
[7:16:11] <%pabloelenano2> un wey
[7:16:12] <%Freakin_Wolfy> did he kill Gowry?
[7:16:14] <arkv01> look some of us can't get through the day without copium :(
[7:16:16] <%livi242> you can save her by not finishing her quest :)
[7:16:20] <%X2Eliah> its wild that such an important item (unalloyed needle) is hidden behind this random missable npc in a shack
[7:16:23] <Sunstalker> You already have a consecutive attack buff talisman. Fuck that 5 dex
[7:16:24] <spinningchurro> You can always save the tatted up alt chick at the coffee shop.
[7:16:43] <Sunstalker> @X2Eliah Its not, it drops from a field boss in the swamp
[7:16:46] <SinisterBroccoli> @Sunstalker they stack
[7:16:48] <@QueequegTheater> monkaS
[7:16:52] <%radiorosewater> most things in life are hidden behind missable npcs in a shack
[7:16:53] <%livi242> ew
[7:16:55] <%luftraumm1> ????
[7:16:55] <%X2Eliah> @X2Eliah broken
[7:16:59] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt he wanted to make her into a Rot God
[7:17:00] <+swesterly> they wanted to turn her into a flower of rot
[7:17:01] <%EldritchBee> kill this fuck
[7:17:06] <jubejube56> I’ve also heard there’s an interesting thing if you kill gowry
[7:17:07] <%X2Eliah> @X2Eliah you need gowry to fix it
[7:17:08] <+Nomenanza> so he was a rot psycho all along
[7:17:08] <+crimsonomen0> Hahah dude just face palming from all the bullshit.
[7:17:09] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Kill his ass.
[7:17:09] <digaogrunge> KILL THIS BITCH
[7:17:11] <%Valdorick> Oh, he's a doomsday cultist.
[7:17:12] <+Smokebanshee> kill him
[7:17:14] <+Rigid_Digidi> end him
[7:17:14] <+TheBitingIrish> RELOAD
[7:17:16] <Mitchellsocks> He tapped Malenia
[7:17:19] <sappinmahbinyot> Ratio'd
[7:17:20] <ohno58> half the npcs in this game are dirtbags
[7:17:20] <RubberFistFight> pfft hahahaha
[7:17:20] <+Nomenanza> bonk
[7:17:21] <+wizard_of_diamonds> HELL YEAH
[7:17:21] <%shootbang_exe> lol
[7:17:24] <+wizard_of_diamonds> LONG DESERVED
[7:17:24] <%Freakin_Wolfy> The way he always says "us" makes me think the pests are a hivemind
[7:17:25] <oda_flobunaga> KILL
[7:17:25] <%justcallmebobplease> They wanted a rot god to follow, Malenia and Millicent both wanted NONE of that.
[7:17:25] <no123450n> BONK
[7:17:25] <RubberFistFight> sent him to the fucking shadow realm
[7:17:25] <%DashXero> Fuck that guy in particular.
[7:17:27] <%fanciful_fright> OH SHIT
[7:17:28] <ohno58> bop
[7:17:37] <boostergoldz> ohhhh shit
[7:17:38] <%fanciful_fright> THATS GOOD
[7:17:39] <+Tredecian> rot cultist
[7:17:39] <%Brassnarwhal> circle of spores druid isn't inherently evil
[7:17:41] <@Spydurman> fuck that guy
[7:17:43] <boostergoldz> i didn't know about this
[7:17:45] <+LandOfTheWay> think you could have just reloaded, but it's fine
[7:17:47] <NewWillinium> So because the Needle used to be used on Milenia by Miqella, I *think* that he was trying to turn Millicent into Malenia with the same needle?
[7:17:50] <sothatsprettybrutal> seems uh good
[7:17:51] <%X2Eliah> rot worshippers
[7:17:51] <%EldritchBee> reload now
[7:17:52] <%rosysyntax> can you get that if you kill him earlier?
[7:17:55] <%Valdorick> But is that one better than just adding +5 faith Kappa
[7:18:00] <some_brave_apollo> what was he even trying to do?
[7:18:14] <@QueequegTheater> @some_brave_apollo Make his daughter a rot goddess
[7:18:16] <+TheBitingIrish> Too late
[7:18:20] <%EldritchBee> aw what???
[7:18:21] <%Freakin_Wolfy> @PatStaresAt if you never killed him before, he turns into one of those centipedes that are all over the haligtree area.
[7:18:22] <%Brassnarwhal> @valdorick i will be equipping both thank you
[7:18:24] <+Rigid_Digidi> japed
[7:18:26] <zenith0111> What a line "What is faith but not affirmation?"
[7:18:31] <sjcodan> You uh, killed him early
[7:18:32] <%EldritchBee> He usually leaves a corpse of one of the Rotspawn bug shitheads
[7:18:35] <TwistParabola> hmm
[7:18:36] <+Nomenanza> Someone also mentioned that if you hit him and the hit doesnt kill outright, he turns into one of those pests. Couldnt verify myself tho
[7:18:43] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt if you attack Gowry earlier he turns into a Kindred of Rot and then shows back up like normal going "Yea I'm a hivemind you cant kill me"
[7:18:46] <$Timesteel> his bell bearing has a decent incant
[7:18:47] <%theeffay> CAT
[7:19:00] <@PrefectusCorgi> Elmo
[7:19:01] <+crimsonomen0> Are we reloading because that’s faster than traveling to a site of grace and running back?
[7:19:03] <+swesterly> @Monkeyweed21 what the fuck
[7:19:04] <+RedMaskBandit> the BABY
[7:19:05] <%Freakin_Wolfy> @PatStaresAt then he comes back when you reload, hinting at a hivemind for the pests since he's still himself
[7:19:11] <%radiorosewater> look at that cat
[7:19:16] <%radiorosewater> who is that
[7:19:19] <RickyRelucent> Olem
[7:19:20] <ArgentUndaCova> Huh, I gotta kill Gowry then mopT
[7:19:31] <%cade_calrayn> Behold, the Lord of Light, the Elden Kitteh, the Great Elmo
[7:19:32] <%rosysyntax> Horrible things? In my Soulsborne?
[7:19:34] <@QueequegTheater> ALien biocurse
[7:19:34] <%Freakin_Wolfy> you can fast travel to the site of grace that's closer
[7:19:36] <Ethel9727> I dunno, I think if we inject that rot we could take over the world with BIO TERROR
[7:19:37] <%Monkeyweed21> the rot is also an outer god
[7:19:38] <%Niney_Who> Miyazaki comes up with worse and worse Supernatural illnesses every game
[7:19:39] <+TheBitingIrish> Chat, did he get Pest Threads?
[7:19:41] <%theeffay> What the hell even IS the scarlet rot, lore wise?
[7:19:43] <it_came_from_outer_space> From is just invent worse and worse cursed ailments
[7:19:43] <sothatsprettybrutal> pat's been making the rot super strong by rotting everybody oops
[7:19:46] <boostergoldz> it's more likely than you think
[7:19:47] <Kilikan5670> Oh man. I thundergunned the fuck out of this place
[7:19:48] <TwistParabola> up!
[7:19:51] <%fanciful_fright> Can't wait for the DLC where we get to throw hands with the Outer Gods
[7:19:57] <it_came_from_outer_space> *inventing
[7:20:02] <%Niney_Who> Do you want Hivemind Parasitic Red Goo or Immortality Evil Primordial Centipedes
[7:20:02] <%Felhad> @patstaresat good item if you drop in through the roof of this building
[7:20:05] <%Brassnarwhal> @queequegtheater sounds like an umbrells corp setup to me
[7:20:11] <Sunstalker> fuck these shrimp and their jizz darts.
[7:20:18] <boostergoldz> oh now it makes sense why gowry sells that bug spell
[7:20:20] <zenith0111> All thr answers so far just give MORE questions
[7:20:20] <%cade_calrayn> @theeffay it's a manifestation of the corruption that occurred by Radagon and Marika (who are the same person) having children. Miquella is also cursed, he's a permanent child
[7:20:22] <NewWillinium> Think the inevitable DLc will add more endinds to the game as well?
[7:20:22] <+Nomenanza> jesus
[7:20:24] <+crimsonomen0> I like how people in here discussing lore and I have no idea wtf is going on.
[7:20:25] <it_came_from_outer_space> wow this is hell
[7:20:29] <%rosysyntax> shrimp'd
[7:20:32] <+gruff_gridof> dang

[7:21:11] <+Kinggarbage> But there’s a bell bearing outside for really good stuff
[7:21:11] <%Valdorick> You know, Pat will likely beat the game next session.
[7:21:11] <TwistParabola> climb branches.
[7:21:11] <%theeffay> @cade_calrayn Huh, that's quite fucked up lmao
[7:21:12] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt yeah so more Rot stuff he didn't mention is all the sisters were asexually made when Malenia unleashed the rot and he groomed them into becoming basically clones of their mother but Millicent didn't due to memory loss
[7:21:14] <pi_in_the_sci> @NewWillinium most of the DLC From makes adds endings
[7:21:21] <%EldritchBee> No Jumping Ahead

[7:22:07] <MooCartoons> pat cant jumb only bounce
[7:22:13] <%jamsbybetty> this whole area feels like DLC
[7:22:13] <@PrefectusCorgi> LUL
[7:22:14] <%fanciful_fright> @pi_in_the_sci Wasn't DS2 literally the only DLC that added an ending?
[7:22:18] <+pittbulldogg> finger but hole
[7:22:20] <sjcodan> Rot MIGHT be outerdimensional space aids
[7:22:20] <%Monkeyweed21> watch Pat beat the boss first try
[7:22:21] <%X2Eliah> I cannot image how woolie will cope wit hthis
[7:22:27] <digaogrunge> Pat is sundowning
[7:22:30] <+Nomenanza> the scale is done very well yes
[7:22:30] <Wakerz140> Honestly, I feel like the talisman in there might be one of the best ones full stop
[7:22:31] <%X2Eliah> ... actually woolie is NEVEr getting here, is he
[7:22:34] <%tsuchi7> I love Haligtree, its like anor londo + great hollow
[7:22:34] <it_came_from_outer_space> vividly
[7:22:34] <RickyRelucent> Not like this game has aftertouch in jumps
[7:22:40] <ape_hawk> ds1 with its fake geometry?
[7:22:42] <rosabellamelantha> @cade_calrayn Gowry outright tells you if you leave him alive long enough also Millicent's talisman
[7:22:42] <TwistParabola> yeah
[7:22:43] <%cade_calrayn> the draw distance is a big part of that
[7:22:47] <knotsundownsyndrome> it's an entire evolution on shadow of colossus' distance scale
[7:22:57] <+Nomenanza> this talisman is great
[7:22:57] <+crimsonomen0> Just add birds.
[7:23:02] <+eanscrale> The Duke's Archive too.
[7:23:02] <rosabellamelantha> @cade_calrayn you also have to buy Gowry's rot spells
[7:23:03] <TwistParabola> YEAH
[7:23:06] <cavefishes> and DS1 CHEATED
[7:23:07] <+Drigoooooo> best defensive talisman
[7:23:08] <TwistParabola> THE BEST TALISMAN
[7:23:10] <+theoldone001> It's literally the See that Mountain? Meme
[7:23:13] <Wakerz140> 20% @PatStaresAt
[7:23:14] <sjcodan> A LOT
[7:23:14] <%rosysyntax> "enormously"
[7:23:14] <ape_hawk> like, 15%?
[7:23:15] <+AyupaPupa> by enourmous
[7:23:15] <it_came_from_outer_space> enormously
[7:23:15] <+Gorgodrn> Almost double
[7:23:16] <V0LK__> by an ENORMOUS ammount
[7:23:16] <%Felhad> like 15%
[7:23:17] <Vermillion129> 10%
[7:23:18] <sothatsprettybrutal> enormously.
[7:23:19] <sjcodan> CHANGE STAT PAGE
[7:23:19] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> a lot
[7:23:20] <%Valdorick> @pi_in_the_sci Dark Souls 3 didn't add a new credits trigger, but it is, in a way, a new ending.
[7:23:22] <GrenYena> AN enormous amount
[7:23:25] <%Valdorick> Hit Triangle
[7:23:27] <TwistParabola> check resists
[7:23:29] <+Nomenanza> pretty much offsets radagon's seal
[7:23:30] <@QueequegTheater> Just use that stat page to see
[7:23:31] <Vermillion129> you can  check stat page
[7:23:36] <%Valdorick> You can change to your resists on that screen
[7:23:36] <sothatsprettybrutal> they really should just put numbers in all of these. just put in numbers
[7:23:37] <+Drigoooooo> never take it off
[7:23:37] <+TheBitingIrish> Just hit Y
[7:23:38] <Khester824> 40
[7:23:40] <Frostydough1> it was the difference between me killing malenia
[7:23:42] <+TheBitingIrish> Er Triangle
[7:23:43] <+Gorgodrn> Only DS2 has added a proper new ending
[7:23:43] <TwistParabola> hit triangle on the stat page
[7:23:45] <%EldritchBee> it balances the soreseal
[7:23:50] <sjcodan> You can literally see it on your stats
[7:23:54] <RickyRelucent> Methinks 15% in a game where 80 dmg is alot is amazing
[7:23:54] <%dekkitout> Rocks, quite strong against bug types
[7:23:59] <rosabellamelantha> ITS HUGE

[7:28:59] <%cade_calrayn> @PatStaresAt she's basically been in a coma since Caelid, I believe, she came back to the Haligtree looking for Miquella and her rot exploded

[7:29:40] <Ethel9727> I mean, Radahn technically lost. He got a  stalemate but was infected

[7:29:44] <ape_hawk> yeah, but radahn contyrolled the stars
[7:29:47] <senfood> RADAHN DIDN'T DO IT
[7:29:48] <%boggsz12> she fucked radahn up dude
[7:29:49] <%fanciful_fright> Radahn just got to Phase 2
[7:29:49] <RyuuAoi> That's a huge blade
[7:29:50] <MicrotonalMatt> Tiny horsey could do it
[7:29:50] <%JonathLP> Radahn didn't do it though?
[7:29:51] <Khester824> FOR RADAHN!!!
[7:29:51] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> She cheesed Radahn
[7:29:51] <Profmcstevie> He fought her to a stand still
[7:29:52] <%Valdorick> Radahn was a draw though, and HE went feral and savage.
[7:29:52] <peachy996> Radahn tried and got fucked up after
[7:29:52] <thesaverofhumens> radahn was beating her but she literally called the god of rot to help her
[7:29:53] <Doc_Crumbles> he didnt do it, though
[7:29:54] <$Solid_Stro> Malenia, remember that time you fought Radahn to a standstill, scarlet rotted him, then ran away like a bitch
[7:29:54] <TheSandmanIsHere> she and radahn drew
[7:29:57] <+Rigid_Digidi> THis ends when she jumps
[7:29:58] <Purpleleven> What os this fuckin Sephiroth sword
[7:29:58] <42nfl19> SHE GOT LIFE STEAL
[7:29:58] <kingra> NO DAMAGE LUL
[7:29:59] <@QueequegTheater> LOOK AT HER HEALTH
[7:30:01] <%tetraes> Best do it solo
[7:30:02] <%dekkitout> Greg the Immovable Vs Malenia the Unbeatable
[7:30:02] <sjcodan> Look at the health bar
[7:30:03] <%retrohazard> look at  this fuckin Lady Maria shit
[7:30:03] <+Nomenanza> Mimic is gonna help but for a different reason
[7:30:04] <Varanoo> Radahn was the coolest tho and all he got was a tie Pat
[7:30:04] <+Grayhammatter> radahn really didn't do it
[7:30:05] <%EldritchBee> Radhan super lost
[7:30:05] <+wizard_of_diamonds> SHE HAS LIFESTEAL

[7:30:10] <%nip_nips> she usin that mimic like a health potion
[7:30:11] <+Huderga> he hasn't noticed
[7:30:11] <%Zundelle> yeah fuck your stupid summon
[7:30:12] <ohno58> just spam weapon arts
[7:30:12] <+joker626> the fact that she heals on hit is funny ngl
[7:30:12] <V0LK__> mimic helps but he can't carry this fight
[7:30:13] <sothatsprettybrutal> does she have regain on everything?
[7:30:13] <sjcodan> She's playing bloodborne
[7:30:16] <%Ironbuttz> she heals?!
[7:30:16] <%justcallmebobplease> It's pretty wild Radahn COULD do it, given he's 'just' a Demigod and she's a bullshit Empyrean.  That, on top of his Star-stopping... just how rad was Radahn with his wits about him!?
[7:30:16] <%TG_Cid11> She has the bloodborne talisman to
[7:30:18] <penitentpendant> She has lifesteal~
[7:30:19] <Omenaire_> shes leeching health from mimic
[7:30:19] <%Freakin_Wolfy> @PatStaresAt Don't forget, Radahn didn't win, he just fought her to stalemate
[7:30:20] <sirrice77> nah radahn got to phase 2 and then the rot got him
[7:30:21] <zenith0111> Oh?
[7:30:21] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> "I am Malenia, Blade of Miquella and I have never known defeat"
[7:30:21] <sjcodan> yes
[7:30:22] <%Maids4lyfe> girl got some reach
[7:30:23] <%EldritchBee> A tie where you become a feral beast? thats an L
[7:30:23] <oda_flobunaga> SHE HAS BLOODBOURNE
[7:30:25] <%JonathLP> She has bloodborne healing
[7:30:26] <%strakillias> She's too fast, need Tiche speed tank
[7:30:27] <Finchit> yea do it
[7:30:27] <digaogrunge> chain stunlocks
[7:30:27] <%whyskeywolfe> Yeah, she heals with every hit you take.
[7:30:28] <+Rigid_Digidi> Hesitation is defeat
[7:30:28] <thesaverofhumens> she heals on hit @PatStaresAt
[7:30:28] <wolfen091> her attacks heal her?!
[7:30:31] <+Tredecian> heals on hit
[7:30:31] <+Drigoooooo> yeah you need to trade shots with your mimic
[7:30:31] <Finchit> stun lock er
[7:30:32] <TheSandmanIsHere> mimic helps her every time she hits it
[7:30:33] <$OfficerMods> she's playing dmc didn't you see that pole dance?
[7:30:33] <%retrohazard> Lady Maria lives
[7:30:34] <RyuuAoi> Her blade tucking heals?
[7:30:34] <+crimsonomen0> She heals? Nah.
[7:30:35] <RubberFistFight> every hit on you or greg heals a BIG chunk
[7:30:36] <sjcodan> Your mimic has done nothing but heal her
[7:30:36] <Doc_Crumbles> @patstaresat have fun with FromSoft Sephiroth
[7:30:36] <%Pookiedaexzile> You're not in her league
[7:30:36] <+Queenemereldas> the mimic is giving her something else to heal on
[7:30:37] <RyuuAoi> Fucking
[7:30:37] <%boggsz12> tiche might, if she dodges
[7:30:37] <TwistParabola> She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella.
[7:30:37] <majindusto> YEP
[7:30:38] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Radahn AT HIS PEAK only fought her to a draw
[7:30:38] <%justcallmebobplease> She has lifesteal, yes.
[7:30:39] <%dekkitout> Greg has this for sure!
[7:30:39] <%nip_nips> its not just lifesteal, she heals on blocked hits too
[7:30:41] <senfood> Hope you enjoy hearing that line.
[7:30:42] <%cade_calrayn> Radahn stabbed her and the Rot exploded, no one won
[7:30:43] <boostergoldz> i'd advise loading up some heals then having your seal out when you summon mimic
[7:30:43] <thesaverofhumens> even if you block she heals
[7:30:43] <%pabloelenano2> fuck you... she does heal on hit
[7:30:44] <TheSandmanIsHere> yep, even through block
[7:30:44] <%greasypete00> man i popped out for a bit and this fight looks like ass
[7:30:44] <+Nomenanza> welcome to reason 1 as to why this fight sucks
[7:30:44] <kingra> Yeah this boss is some shit
[7:30:47] <%pinkslimegoblin> she heals on hits to shield too
[7:30:47] <Finchit> well i lost 50 bucks
[7:30:48] <peachy996> Yeah she's great ain't she?
[7:30:49] <+blitz31295> the moment ive been waiting for
[7:30:50] <%Niney_Who> Artorias Orphan of Kos-ass
[7:30:51] <@Spydurman> everyone settle in, this might take a bit
[7:30:51] <ape_hawk> who is she the blade of?
[7:30:52] <CashZen> Watch her not do the 30 Hit Super DMC Combo, Pat's been so lucky this run.
[7:30:52] <%luftraumm1> she's just Maria + Gehrman
[7:30:52] <%Valdorick> Tip - if you use Mimic-Chan on this fight, pop a rune arc to give mimic more health and damage.
[7:30:54] <pi_in_the_sci> Radahn walks away from that fight way more fucked up than she did
[7:30:54] <no123450n> does she heal on block?
[7:30:55] <sothatsprettybrutal> gyobu masataka oniwa over here
[7:30:55] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> alright guys, see you in 50 more attempts
[7:30:56] <RyuuAoi> Wow BS
[7:30:57] <%Cozy90> So it begins
[7:30:57] <thesaverofhumens> summons will keep her alive forever
[7:30:58] <zenith0111> B-but mimic? BibleThump
[7:30:58] <tolloponik> just parry Kappa
[7:30:58] <sjcodan> She heals on BLOCKS too
[7:30:58] <+BoboDaHobo> heals on hit, even blocked hits
[7:31:01] <@QueequegTheater> @no123450n yes
[7:31:01] <Zebroneath> she even heals on blocked hits
[7:31:03] <RubberFistFight> again, she's rockin 3 prosthetics and isn't at her best. Imagine what she could do if healthy.
[7:31:03] <sappinmahbinyot> @QueequegTheater and then she dirty bombed hs entire region for the lols
[7:31:03] <Kanrir_> The fact she went hiding for all eternity proves she didnt win against radhahn
[7:31:05] <rosabellamelantha> To be fair he BEAT EHR but then she pulled out the Rot
[7:31:05] <$Bruh_itsTC> summon kept her topped off
[7:31:06] <%Valdorick> She DOES hela on a block
[7:31:09] <peachy996> Yeah now she'll walk
[7:31:10] <TwistParabola> @CashZen she only does it below 80%
[7:31:10] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> The only reason Radahn lost was because she cheesed it with rot
[7:31:11] <cavefishes> yeah but she got her ass beat so bad one of her knights had to carry her back to the haligtree
[7:31:12] <no123450n> wtf im a block build
[7:31:13] <%The_0_2_Hero> The_0_2_Hero subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 25 months! Jump attacks stronk
[7:31:14] <AtisutoCurry> just dont get hit, EZ
[7:31:14] <Finchit> basically jet stream sam
[7:31:16] <$realm_forge> Greg will never give in! Fight until the end Greg!
[7:31:19] <RubberFistFight> this is like Artorias kicking your ass with a broken arm on steroids.
[7:31:20] <+Tredecian> gowry's bell bearing lets you buy pest homing missles
[7:31:21] <turtlebits64> btw she can't be parry'd
[7:31:22] <%nip_nips> this gonna take a hot minute
[7:31:23] <%cade_calrayn> @sappinmahbinyot she lost control, I believe, it wasn't her fault
[7:31:23] <%whyskeywolfe> I found Tiche to be pretty helpful here.
[7:31:24] <%Pookiedaexzile> Full Health

[7:32:35] <%JonathLP> Weapon switch
[7:32:37] <TwistParabola> @ScrapKingKeita who?
[7:32:37] <+leviting> she looks like the sequal to Orphan of Kos
[7:32:38] <+theoldone001> Her sword is part of her prosthetic, she's so cool
[7:32:39] <thesaverofhumens> @thesaverofhumens which one? phase 1 or 2 or the constant healing
[7:32:39] <%X2Eliah> "biggest male vtuber" of is that how we call male porn actors now
[7:32:41] <Kanrir_> @RedMaskBandit she sleeping for all eternity under a tree isnt a win either, radhahn lost his sanity but she couldnt kill him either
[7:32:41] <%Valdorick> Blasphemous Blade is going to be a godsend here.
[7:32:41] <+eanscrale> you know, that bleeding whip looks really useful right about now
[7:32:43] <+swesterly> @sjcodan what'd you use to beat her
[7:32:44] <pth88> last boss in most from games is usually a joke
[7:32:44] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt That command grab might 1-shot you, btw
[7:32:46] <%JonathLP> She switched to the slow, hard hitting mode
[7:32:48] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> she doesnt have much health, it just takes forever and you cant make mistakes
[7:32:49] <+ScrapKingKeita> @ScrapKingKeita Kuzuha, from Nijisanji
[7:32:49] <peachy996> I fear the day Paige meets her ingame self in Elden Ring and tries to beat her
[7:32:52] <ArgentUndaCova> You're doing it Pat PrideRise
[7:32:53] <%Pookiedaexzile> You can jump her low slash
[7:32:56] <%X2Eliah> her sword is just a naked blade
[7:32:58] <%NBUsagi> That slow walk is intimidating
[7:32:59] <%X2Eliah> very edge
[7:33:00] <%EldritchBee> the command grab WILL kill him
[7:33:00] <sjcodan> @sjcodan Moonviel and Greg
[7:33:04] <Finchit> imagine if artorias had a prosthetic arm, basically the same thing
[7:33:08] <@QueequegTheater> @sjcodan You said this earlier and got an answe
[7:33:12] <Mitchellsocks> She's got the Senpou High Kick
[7:33:13] <%tetraes> My favorit e fight
[7:33:14] <Kilikan5670> Bleed is great for this fight.
[7:33:18] <RubberFistFight> @QueequegTheater which one - the one with the big upward thrust or the other one that everyone loathes
[7:33:20] <TwistParabola> She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella.
[7:33:21] <doster504> @I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I Is that what not too much health looks like that looks like a slog to me
[7:33:22] <%Pookiedaexzile> Red Artorias
[7:33:24] <sjcodan> DEX ARTORIAS
[7:33:26] <42nfl19> Hold on, I think I is heard...what was her name again?
[7:33:27] <%LaughingCatt> Artorias is a joke compared to her
[7:33:28] <@QueequegTheater> @RubberFistFight The skewer
[7:33:29] <%whyskeywolfe> Her Poise isn't great, so fast weapons can interrupt her.
[7:33:30] <senfood> I'd say she's Lady Maria.
[7:33:31] <Wakerz140> Artorias before he got all goopy and broke his arm
[7:33:31] <%Cozy90> She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella.
[7:33:31] <TwistParabola> Artorias wishes he was this cool
[7:33:32] <%twohitgood> ishin
[7:33:32] <%shootbang_exe> mariartorias
[7:33:33] <$realm_forge> I wanna see her go head to head with Lady Maria
[7:33:33] <thesaverofhumens> I want to see modders make her fight other bosses
[7:33:33] <oda_flobunaga> More like the Orphan of Artorias
[7:33:34] <%MrMegaJackpots> she is malenia blade of miquella
[7:33:34] <Vermillion129> imagine if paige beat her in one try
[7:33:35] <peachy996> aka Milennia, as in you'll be here forever
[7:33:35] <$OfficerMods> you WISH she was artorias
[7:33:36] <Finchit> yes
[7:33:36] <MoustacheCEO> Starscourge Greatsword can stunlock her easy idk why Radahn couldn't beat her
[7:33:36] <TheSandmanIsHere> also Maria
[7:33:36] <Profmcstevie> Artorias had a cool dog and a busted arm, I dunno man
[7:33:37] <bassoontyphoon> Wait who is she again?
[7:33:38] <tolloponik> can you duck that kick?
[7:33:39] <%jamsbybetty> She's my favorite boss design in the game I want the action figure
[7:33:41] <+CherteuseKapibara> ArtoriASS
[7:33:41] <Mitchellsocks> And she has never known defeat
[7:33:42] <Khester824> SHE’S MARIA FROM BLOODBORNE
[7:33:42] <Strigiform> I am Artorius the Abyss Walker
[7:33:42] <+Tredecian> red head artorias maria
[7:33:42] <%Cozy90> No She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella.
[7:33:42] <ArgentUndaCova> She be ZOOMIN
[7:33:43] <mike2hands> R36 artorias RED
[7:33:43] <+Nomenanza> They've been trying to out-artorias themselves ever since DS1
[7:33:44] <Sigma_190_Beta> Dex Artorias is probably the most correct.
[7:33:44] <peachy996> She's definitely Maria
[7:33:45] <sappinmahbinyot> Orphan of Isshintorias
[7:33:45] <TwistParabola> Artorias with a prosthetic
[7:33:45] <ohno58> no
[7:33:46] <+Huderga> yeah no range
[7:33:46] <Varanoo> She's Artorias if Artorias wasn't fucked up
[7:33:46] <RubberFistFight> Artorias, maria, gael, on steroids.
[7:33:46] <+AyupaPupa> freide
[7:33:47] <+RushUnplugged> more Maria than Artorias for sure
[7:33:48] <%EldritchBee> I got her in under an hour and I regret it because it felt cheesy with twin blood curve greatswords and mimic
[7:33:51] <TheSandmanIsHere> Maria, Orphan of Artorias
[7:33:51] <Finchit> fucked up arm
[7:33:51] <+Huderga> she dodges it all the time
[7:33:52] <@QueequegTheater> She's Fume Knight too
[7:33:53] <+Rigid_Digidi> Feels like maria with the sidestepping
[7:33:54] <sjcodan> Mariartorios
[7:33:55] <T_Sasquatch> she is a player character LUL that became a boss
[7:33:55] <+leviting> dextorias
[7:33:57] <Lulu19> way harder than both.
[7:33:58] <RubberFistFight> bit of Isshin in there too
[7:33:58] <+swesterly> @sjcodan oh so you cheese'd her, cool
[7:33:59] <ohno58> Artorias was an actually good boss fight
[7:34:00] <%shootbang_exe> has he upgraded anything to +10 or +25?
[7:34:00] <+Gorgodrn> Fast = Artorias Woman = Maria Checks out
[7:34:01] <it_came_from_outer_space> its so funny the way enemies just orbit around you when they jump
[7:34:01] <Lulu19> imo
[7:34:02] <%shootbang_exe> might help
[7:34:02] <%Maids4lyfe> LADY MARY ARTORIAS THE DEXTERITY WALKER
[7:34:02] <%Valdorick> Black Flame Fredia
[7:34:03] <thesaverofhumens> @MoustacheCEO because she abused rot and ran away
[7:34:03] <TrollKing96> This is a Sekiro boss.
[7:34:03] <WillSin4Cash> if she's artorias does that mean she's GUTS :O
[7:34:04] <oda_flobunaga> and then ther's phase 2
[7:34:07] <+noelsixty> love the fact that she's not even that much aggressive. her personality shows
[7:34:08] <%Maids4lyfe> *Maria
[7:34:09] <digaogrunge> Shes pretty fucking cool, maybe the best in all these games
[7:34:12] <%EldritchBee> I stopped using Mimic after her because it felt cheap
[7:34:12] <%greasypete00> she also looks like she has sekiro moves
[7:34:12] <%whyskeywolfe> She's Brockway, Ogdenville, North Haverbrook
[7:34:16] <+LandOfTheWay> Martoria of the Astral Blood Wolf Rot
[7:34:17] <MooCartoons> Im sorrry, could you say your name again? I didn't quite hear it
[7:34:17] <%Niney_Who> There is no such thing as Overlevelled to this boss
[7:34:17] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> this fight is built to cheese
[7:34:18] <%nip_nips> she is malenia
[7:34:19] <+Nomenanza> oh you definitely not overleveled for this
[7:34:22] <%fanciful_fright> Imagine if she didn't stagger. How much of a nightmare would that be.
[7:34:23] <+leviting> I'd say she's more genichiro than maria
[7:34:23] <Omenaire_> damn
[7:34:24] <%CopperTucker> the real game is now
[7:34:24] <ArgentUndaCova> She is what again? mopT
[7:34:24] <%Maids4lyfe> JESUS CHRIST
[7:34:25] <%watts121> It should be noted that Radahn was winning that fight.
[7:34:25] <+Nomenanza> this is THE hardest boss in the game
[7:34:25] <no123450n> almost
[7:34:25] <RubberFistFight> Even if you were overlevelled it doesn't matter. you're doing like, 400ish per hit. She's a fucking tank.
[7:34:26] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> She is Malenia
[7:34:27] <peachy996> blade of miquella
[7:34:27] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> She'smy favorite Dark Soul
[7:34:27] <Sigma_190_Beta> She is Malenia.
[7:34:27] <TwistParabola> She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella.
[7:34:28] <%TG_Cid11> This is considered the endgame
[7:34:29] <sjcodan> @sjcodan Define "Cheesing" I don't even HAVE mimic tear
[7:34:29] <mike2hands> she's indeed malenia
[7:34:30] <%Cozy90> She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella.
[7:34:31] <%luftraumm1> man enb is gonna try to parry everything she's got
[7:34:34] <Wakerz140> You might actually be a bit weak for this fight
[7:34:35] <cavefishes> your damage actually seems kinda low
[7:34:36] <+Tredecian> wait itll it gets hard
[7:34:36] <+BoboDaHobo> I genuinely think they overdid it with the heals. blocked hits should at least have reduced heal.
[7:34:36] <+theoldone001> FromSoft has the coolest female characters
[7:34:37] <+Edrem> I just wanna see her anime jump LUL
[7:34:39] <halfmasks> Okay, Millicent, Sword of Morgot
[7:34:39] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt imagine doing this with 700 Health
[7:34:40] <@QueequegTheater> She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella
[7:34:40] <+Rigid_Digidi> What level is he?
[7:34:40] <+Rofiarf> erdtree greatshield build is a pretty good counter for her
[7:34:41] <$OfficerMods> i actually beat her way under pat's level but i used the bloodhound skill over and over
[7:34:42] <MoustacheCEO> @MoustacheCEO Radahn could've just spammed R1 though but he was a scrub
[7:34:42] <%geekjacob> can we give her status effefts?
[7:34:43] <mike2hands> blade of michaella
[7:34:45] <%watts121> Radahn was about to win so she injected rot directly into his body.
[7:34:48] <TheSandmanIsHere> there is no such thing as overleveled for this fight
[7:34:50] <+Drigoooooo> this fight is basically how broken is your character?
[7:34:52] <%geekjacob> or is she immune too them?
[7:34:53] <%Zundelle> I enjoy the range of opinions on this boss "she's the coolest shit ever" "this is the worst boss fromsoft has ever made"
[7:34:54] <ohno58> What's her name again?
[7:34:55] <%Felhad> Her name is Robert Paulson
[7:34:55] <Lulu19> bloodloss
[7:34:58] <thesaverofhumens> his damage isn't low, she's just insane
[7:34:59] <$realm_forge> I am Ligma  champion of deez nutz
[7:35:00] <sappinmahbinyot> God it feels great to see other people suffer with thisboss after I put 9 hours into beating her. the hype was so insane when I beat her I felt like an empyrean
[7:35:00] <xanerts> Before I bear she actually felt impossible
[7:35:02] <Sunstalker> So you can't even try to guard counter her with here hp drain?
[7:35:03] <%EldritchBee> The heal is overtuned, they gotta change it
[7:35:03] <%MrMegaJackpots> She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella
[7:35:03] <NewWillinium> @Rigid_Digidi 153 ish
[7:35:07] <spectre_shrimp> melanie blade of michelle
[7:35:08] <projecthazoid> she's even healing off your dying corpse
[7:35:08] <Midnight188> this seems like a fight you, optmally, never want to get hit in at all.
[7:35:10] <rosabellamelantha> the only way I can beat her is by doing 2k per hit every hit
[7:35:10] <+SaintSalted> you have to powerstamce for more dps
[7:35:11] <MoustacheCEO> @Drigoooooo This is Emerald Weapon type of bullshit JRPG boss
[7:35:14] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @Zundelle I honestly think it's both.
[7:35:15] <%SaiyanShoto> I'm kinda surprised how low your damage is
[7:35:17] <%Valdorick> Yeah, she has... 15K hp?
[7:35:18] <V0LK__> her hits erase your fight progress T_T that's unfair
[7:35:18] <T_Sasquatch> @watts121 and he still lived LUL
[7:35:19] <$Jaxnos> i have committed completely to the cheese strat and am still struggling with her.
[7:35:21] <%greasypete00> thats definitely a sekiro kick
[7:35:23] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> She pops the wrist joint to get extension!
[7:35:24] <Midnight188> like her healing is like "no you need to no-hit this"
[7:35:26] <MooCartoons> OOF
[7:35:28] <sjcodan> His damage does seem a bit low, my katana was doing more per hit than this greatsword
[7:35:29] <peachy996> she's got some cool animations
[7:35:29] <boostergoldz> she's at least not super aggressive on punishing heals
[7:35:30] <%MaybeFalco> i had to cheese this fight with powerstancing and a LOT of consumables
[7:35:31] <%EldritchBee> I'm pretty sure she can heal off of other player phantoms
[7:35:32] <RickyRelucent> I'm sorry, the fact hat she has a prosthetic katana still gets me LUL
[7:35:33] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt try bleed
[7:35:33] <sothatsprettybrutal> hell of a stinger
[7:35:34] <%Niney_Who> She hasn't done The Move yet
[7:35:34] <@QueequegTheater> lmao
[7:35:35] <SinisterBroccoli> @Valdorick 26k
[7:35:35] <Mitchellsocks> she has 28000 hp
[7:35:37] <Lulu19> she still hasnt done that move lol
[7:35:37] <%livi242> just don't get hit :)
[7:35:40] <%watts121> I will say the way I beat her was me and my mimic stunlocked her ass in a corner
[7:35:41] <+swesterly> she's easy to cheese, but so cool you don't want to
[7:35:42] <sjcodan> Wait, is he back to using the holy weapon?
[7:35:42] <TheSandmanIsHere> also some Isshin in here
[7:35:42] <%EldritchBee> not summons, but literally the random phantoms
[7:35:44] <Omenaire_> your only choice is dip ducking and dodging
[7:35:46] <%whyskeywolfe> She unlocks the big move at 75%.
[7:35:47] <$OfficerMods> WHATS HER NAME PAT?
[7:35:50] <MooCartoons> Her effective range is all
[7:35:52] <@QueequegTheater> dodge duck dip dive and dodge
[7:35:53] <NewWillinium> So I do think that having a companion in this fight is worth it, if just to distract her attention and stagger her for more of the fight
[7:35:54] <@QueequegTheater> She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella
[7:35:54] <%Cozy90> She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella.
[7:35:55] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt I would powerstance maybe to boost your dps
[7:35:56] <%MrMegaJackpots> She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella
[7:35:56] <RubberFistFight> SHE IS MALENIA
[7:35:56] <RickyRelucent> she's the trailer person
[7:35:57] <TwistParabola> She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella.
[7:35:57] <tolloponik> she only heals 200 per hit
[7:35:57] <%greasypete00> She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella
[7:35:58] <+crimsonomen0> So when do we summon and then spam magic?
[7:35:58] <Sigma_190_Beta> @sjcodan Yes, Because Moonveil is super DPS.
[7:35:59] <televisedrevolting> "Just don't get hit." whatever her name is said to your still corpse
[7:35:59] <mike2hands> her name is what?
[7:35:59] <ArgentUndaCova> She is something or rather mopT
[7:35:59] <RickyRelucent> amazing
[7:36:00] <%X2Eliah> Pat you might want a weapon with ssome status effects on it
[7:36:00] <RubberFistFight> BLADE OF MIQUELLA
[7:36:02] <+blitz31295> SAY HER NAME
[7:36:04] <+RushUnplugged> AND SHE HAS NEVER KNOWN DEFEAT
[7:36:06] <%Valdorick> What's her BROTHER'S name!?
[7:36:08] <%shootbang_exe> or upgrade a weapon
[7:36:08] <%X2Eliah> because your damage is pitiful here
[7:36:08] <sappinmahbinyot> Who is this boss? Didn't catch that quote at the end Kappa
[7:36:08] <+Rigid_Digidi> Blade of what?
[7:36:09] <sjcodan> Maybe the firesword would be better?
[7:36:11] <RubberFistFight> Pat's gonna wake up screaming that for the next week lol
[7:36:11] <%theeffay> This is a Sekiro ass boss lol
[7:36:14] <oda_flobunaga> BLEED or FROST
[7:36:15] <Khester824> Time to bring in Black Knife Waifu
[7:36:16] <some_brave_apollo> not rot, obviously
[7:36:17] <+theoldone001> She feels like a boss you should have Sekiro's deflect for but they forgot to put it in the game
[7:36:17] <halfmasks> just perfectly dodge everything, easy
[7:36:17] <%whyskeywolfe> @QueequegTheater *(throws wrench)*
[7:36:19] <Mitchellsocks> I honestly dont know how you beat her without bleed or frost
[7:36:19] <Lulu19> moveset and speed wise shes more similar to a sekiro boss.
[7:36:20] <%Niney_Who> Because she's TOUGH
[7:36:20] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> Tiche can throw her around no problem
[7:36:22] <peachy996> Think Malenia and Radahn are gonna be the standout bosses of Elden Ring
[7:36:22] <tolloponik> would rot even work?
[7:36:22] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Summon Oleg lol
[7:36:23] <2deep5u> you're not overleveled, that's all
[7:36:24] <%greasypete00> i think shes just tough as shit
[7:36:25] <+Huderga> she is very strong
[7:36:25] <Zourath> Wait, I missed that, what was her name again?
[7:36:25] <Finchit> bleed and frost destroy her
[7:36:26] <boostergoldz> it's not low she just has a ton of hp
[7:36:29] <sjcodan> MAYBE SHE RESISTS THAT DAMAGE TYPE?
[7:36:30] <%Maids4lyfe> what if you chuck lightning at her?
[7:36:30] <@QueequegTheater> She's got NG+ values I think
[7:36:30] <+BahaPrisdimee> because it isnt the almighty bleed
[7:36:31] <%vexion_smh> OH HER
[7:36:32] <cavefishes> use the faith buff spells
[7:36:32] <sirrice77> that's not low, that's just her health
[7:36:32] <SinisterBroccoli> maybe the split damage?
[7:36:33] <%SaiyanShoto> She's just that beefy I guess
[7:36:34] <vivaciouseff> your damage isn't low, her health bar is just massive
[7:36:35] <RickyRelucent> she was in the trailer guys, i just realized
[7:36:35] <%Valdorick> She has high Phys and holy defense.
[7:36:36] <+Nomenanza> She lifesteals like 300 HP per hit, even when blocked
[7:36:37] <Midnight188> would Black Knife work here?
[7:36:37] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt prevailing theory is this area is broken and working on NG+ stats for some reason. rosabella was talking about it in here earlier.
[7:36:38] <+RushUnplugged> LOL no, 40 vigor isn't maxed out
[7:36:39] <NewWillinium> I wonder if anyone has dared try to Parry Malenia to death
[7:36:40] <+Huderga> yep
[7:36:42] <some_brave_apollo> probably because most people use a status effect that does a percentage, like bleed
[7:36:43] <candidateplays> Isn't the Soft cap at 80 now? How do you have that on NG?
[7:36:45] <GrenYena> Your damage isnt low, she's just strong
[7:36:46] <digaogrunge> Clearly underlevel
[7:36:46] <+theoldone001> I beat her with Hoarfrost Stomp and Bleed
[7:36:47] <+SpiritRoads> @PatStaresAt she prolly has good holy res since this is holy faith land
[7:36:47] <fumbles_tho> cause you think 40 is the is enough
[7:36:49] <RickyRelucent> 70 0 is maxed
[7:36:49] <%luftraumm1> game probably expects you to have a +10
[7:36:50] <%vexion_smh> JEEZ
[7:36:50] <Omenaire_> BACK TO FULL
[7:36:50] <%EldritchBee> She hasn't even done the Waterfowl Step
[7:36:53] <senfood> Malenia is an optional super boss. She's busted af.
[7:36:55] <boostergoldz> vig soft cap is 60
[7:36:57] <AtisutoCurry> YEAH STABBO
[7:36:59] <%livi242> @newwillinium Lobos did
[7:36:59] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> black knife DOES help, just not for the whole fight
[7:37:00] <it_came_from_outer_space> @QueequegTheater huh, how come?
[7:37:01] <%whyskeywolfe> Tiche really helps out here.
[7:37:01] <%jamsbybetty> she heals on blocks which, honestly, is the most bullshit part of the fight
[7:37:02] <no123450n> she even leeches off her kicks
[7:37:02] <sjcodan> Literally don't get hit
[7:37:02] <%Cozy90> @Midnight188 the weapon?
[7:37:02] <thesaverofhumens> split damage has to go through two sets of defenses before calculation that's why, and she has absurdly high resistances
[7:37:02] <+Huderga> wait till the fucko move
[7:37:03] <RubberFistFight> @some_brave_apollo even that barely helps
[7:37:04] <%Valdorick> His sword IS +10
[7:37:04] <halfmasks> @PatStaresAt she's probably resistent to holy given she's a demigod
[7:37:04] <RickyRelucent> 70 80* hardcaps are way highr this time aroun
[7:37:05] <Omenaire_> PERFECT
[7:37:05] <cavefishes> golden vow and flame give me strength both stack
[7:37:05] <%MrMegaJackpots> She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella
[7:37:05] <+Edrem> @NewWillinium there is a "no damage" run that does that, a lotta parries and the mega giant shield for her anime attack
[7:37:05] <%nerxiv> dunno, she should be weak to fire being rot based
[7:37:07] <sappinmahbinyot> @Nomenanza It's actually a flat percent  of her own HP based on the move she uses IIRC
[7:37:08] <%twohitgood> time to break out the havels.
[7:37:10] <AtisutoCurry> she is malenia, blade of miquella
[7:37:11] <%MrMegaJackpots> you can knock her down with blasphemous blade
[7:37:11] <TwistParabola> She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella.
[7:37:12] <%X2Eliah> She can outheal you
[7:37:12] <+SaintSalted> yo i just learned something
[7:37:12] <%Cozy90> She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella.
[7:37:12] <%Felhad> @rubberfistfight rosabella also retracted that
[7:37:13] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @candidateplays 1st Softcap is 50-ish. Scaling basically drops off completely after 80.
[7:37:13] <RyuuAoi> Maybe she weak to fire
[7:37:16] <Paperware> still at max health too
[7:37:16] <+SaintSalted> she is melania
[7:37:16] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Malenia
[7:37:17] <+crimsonomen0> That timing.
[7:37:18] <Midnight188> @Cozy90 yeah the weapon art
[7:37:19] <@QueequegTheater> @it_came_from_outer_space She's bugged
[7:37:19] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt it's not that your damage is low it's that you're not BROKEN which is how people tend to beat her
[7:37:21] <%SaiyanShoto> If she's got NG+ stats does that mean she would be NG++ on NG+ LUL
[7:37:21] <%nip_nips> im confused, who is this boss again?
[7:37:22] <%sporeian94> Fromsoft really took that "Soulsborne No Hit Series Run" to heart here
[7:37:22] <Sigma_190_Beta> She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella.
[7:37:22] <lockoo404> might come back after the final boss
[7:37:24] <+Nomenanza> @sappinmahbinyot oh that's nice to know
[7:37:24] <coziestbank> Black Flame
[7:37:25] <+crimsonomen0> You’re getting sucked into her rhythm.
[7:37:25] <%whyskeywolfe> She's resistant to Rot, nut sure anything else.
[7:37:26] <%jamsbybetty> black flame helps mitigate her healing
[7:37:27] <+SaintSalted> blade of miquella apparently
[7:37:28] <%watts121> This fight took lobos jr several hours with his strength build.
[7:37:28] <+theoldone001> What's her Name? I forgot
[7:37:30] <sothatsprettybrutal> gods hate blasphemy
[7:37:31] <cavefishes> Golden Vow is pog
[7:37:32] <Sunstalker> Anything wearing Gold Armor tends to resist holy
[7:37:33] <peachy996> She is Blade
[7:37:33] <%Cozy90> @Midnight188 she dodges it real quick
[7:37:34] <ArgentUndaCova> Blade of Nicholas Cage mopT
[7:37:34] <no123450n> maybe weak to scarlet rot Kappa
[7:37:34] <%cade_calrayn> Yeah I did a lot more damage with Moonveil
[7:37:36] <RubberFistFight> @Felhad did she? All i saw was she wasn't entirely certain because she's not a tester.
[7:37:38] <+Kinggarbage> THIS is a super boss
[7:37:38] <%watts121> Granted he wasn't using Hoarfrost Stomp or anything OP.
[7:37:44] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> SHE RAN TO MEET YOU
[7:37:44] <%Valdorick> 150 more
[7:37:49] <@QueequegTheater> @SaiyanShoto No, she's bugged, she does the same damage on NG+ as here
[7:37:51] <+Kinggarbage> Bleed with slime is dirty but works
[7:37:54] <RubberFistFight> @cade_calrayn i did fuck-all damage with moonveil and couldn't figure out why
[7:37:56] <%shootbang_exe> she staggers easy-ish too if you wanna throw rocks
[7:37:56] <%SaiyanShoto> That's better
[7:37:57] <%Pookiedaexzile> Malenia Side Bitch Supreme
[7:37:57] <+Nomenanza> yeah pretty much treat it as a super boss
[7:38:03] <%EldritchBee> Like, he hasn't even SEEN The Move yet
[7:38:03] <jubejube56> Considering how she fights summons with multiple numbers might do well at staggering her, idk how much health they give her off life steal tho
[7:38:13] <purple9z> takers is also good since her poise is low
[7:38:14] <%SaiyanShoto> @SaiyanShoto Oh damn. well that kinda sucks
[7:38:14] <%luftraumm1> is the God slayer gonna see a return???
[7:38:16] <rosabellamelantha> @SaiyanShoto Yeah on NG+ she does the exact same damage and has the exact same HP
[7:38:18] <%AyotoCorp> Fun fact: to parry Malenia, Blade of Miquella, you have to parry her THREE times before she enters a stagger state.  Also like half of her moves are unparryable.
[7:38:18] <+BoboDaHobo> weird that they wouldn't tell the player this boss's name because she seems important
[7:38:20] <+Rigid_Digidi> Its so depressing when you have her a quarter down and by the time she kills you shes up to full health
[7:38:20] <Mitchellsocks> Like Maria, she has low poise outside of her prosthetic charged moves
[7:38:21] <+blitz31295> Some bosses are easily forgotten, then there's Malenia, Blade of Miquella
[7:38:21] <sjcodan> Parrying IS an option
[7:38:22] <+Kinggarbage> Same amount but if you stun lock ur good
[7:38:23] <%MrMegaJackpots> She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella
[7:38:24] <sothatsprettybrutal> Z for Zorro
[7:38:25] <Omenaire_> had it for a second
[7:38:25] <+Nomenanza> iirc she even gives more souls than the final boss if that is an indicator
[7:38:25] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> med range weps like the moonveil helps
[7:38:26] <thesaverofhumens> gotta watch your stamina
[7:38:26] <%tetraes> Dodge into it
[7:38:26] <%theeffay> That multislash move fucks me up too lmao
[7:38:27] <NewWillinium> So why is Moonveil the meme Int-Dex weapon?  My Cold Grand Epee and Cold Naginata did more damage then it, *and* procced Frost faster then bleed.
[7:38:28] <oda_flobunaga> SO, anyone who beats her right now gets serious bragging rights
[7:38:28] <TwistParabola> She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella.
[7:38:28] <AtisutoCurry> she is malenia, blade of miquella
[7:38:29] <$OfficerMods> just play perfect
[7:38:30] <%tetraes> not away
[7:38:30] <JDlightside> powerstance?
[7:38:30] <%shootbang_exe> she has low poise
[7:38:31] <%SveriSageAdvice> i ended up powerstancing fully upgraded Moonveil and fully upgraded Meteoric Ore Blade with a mimic tear just to deal nearly enough damage with bleed and stunlock
[7:38:31] <+noelsixty> dodge into her if she does that
[7:38:31] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Blade of Miquella
[7:38:32] <@QueequegTheater> You fucken don't
[7:38:33] <peachy996> You know who she is?
[7:38:33] <%greasypete00> just get out of the way id imagine
[7:38:33] <%fanciful_fright> Can't backstep it, gotta sideroll her stuff
[7:38:34] <%whyskeywolfe> Just wait.
[7:38:34] <Omenaire_> PARRY IT OLD SCHOOL STYLE
[7:38:35] <%DashXero> She made a sound before that flurry...
[7:38:35] <it_came_from_outer_space> @it_came_from_outer_space Does she do like the same amount of dmg in NG+ or something?
[7:38:35] <+SaintSalted> need to quickstep plus bleed basically
[7:38:36] <+SpiritRoads> they really expect you to use your guard here
[7:38:36] <NanoHologuise> big thancred vibes from this lady
[7:38:37] <%Valdorick> That's not even the final form of her combo
[7:38:37] <SinisterBroccoli> you can parry her
[7:38:38] <thesaverofhumens> your stamina is your hp in this fight LUL
[7:38:38] <+crimsonomen0> Where the thief bitch at? Get her up in here.
[7:38:38] <%Maids4lyfe> god you know what would suck? if she had a phase two
[7:38:39] <+Drigoooooo> me and the Mimic stunlocked her with Guts sword with frost wasn't easy tho
[7:38:39] <sjcodan> You CAN do this fight without getting hit
[7:38:39] <+Huderga> dodge in on the flurry
[7:38:40] <RubberFistFight> I've learned how to avoid that one, you need to dodge towards and past her
[7:38:40] <%whyskeywolfe> It'll get worse.
[7:38:41] <RickyRelucent> inigo montoya
[7:38:43] <%X2Eliah> moonveil is the meme katana
[7:38:43] <RickyRelucent> prepare to die
[7:38:44] <coziestbank> Frostbite work?
[7:38:45] <TwistParabola> gotta sideroll that one
[7:38:46] <RubberFistFight> it's super unintuitive
[7:38:47] <%boggsz12> maybe roll towards her instead of back?
[7:38:47] <NewWillinium> @oda_flobunaga *Proceeds to brag*
[7:38:49] <Zebroneath> she backsteps a lot of parry attempts
[7:38:49] <+swesterly> you can sprint away from the first two flurries and roll into the last one
[7:38:52] <coziestbank> like hoarfrost stomp?
[7:38:55] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt See how powerstancing goes
[7:38:57] <boostergoldz> i used hoarfrost stomp
[7:38:57] <$realm_forge> Try seducing her with your sexy orb dance
[7:39:00] <Mitchellsocks> @NewWillinium Because you one or 2 tap people with the weapon art in PVP
[7:39:04] <%dcentii> Roll through that one
[7:39:05] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> stomp is pretty good
[7:39:05] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt she's probably going to get nerfed because she currently have NG+ values for all her shit right now pat
[7:39:06] <+SaintSalted> most people change their whole build fpr this fight
[7:39:06] <%MrMegaJackpots> the blasphemous blade weapon art works on her
[7:39:09] <sappinmahbinyot> A lot of her moves need to be rolled in different directions
[7:39:10] <+blitz31295> the best part is hes seen nothing yet
[7:39:11] <Paperware> jumping R2 is pretty good since she has a tendency to swing over you
[7:39:13] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @NewWillinium Its weapon art staggers as much as a colossal weapon, does a fuckton of damage, and applies bleed if done in melee range. 3-4 of them with your Mimic will knock her down.
[7:39:14] <+ArmoredDeath> romollaRomegalul
[7:39:15] <oda_flobunaga> @NewWillinium *nods knowingly*
[7:39:15] <42nfl19> It sucks that all Pat's heals are on kill while hers is on hit
[7:39:16] <%greasypete00> were back to this bad boy
[7:39:16] <%nip_nips> @Drigoooooo yeah i had to make sure mimic tear had aggro whenever she did the big fucko move
[7:39:18] <+BubbaRands> B I G G E R
[7:39:18] <%Cozy90> Pat the way i did this fight was low equip roll for more i frames
[7:39:18] <Omenaire_> bigger number
[7:39:19] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> OLD RELIABLE
[7:39:19] <Vermillion129> das big
[7:39:19] <senfood> ...BIGGER
[7:39:20] <+Nomenanza> oh right godslaying sword
[7:39:20] <halfmasks> LETS GO
[7:39:20] <NewWillinium> @NewWillinium Ahhhhh. PVP Got it
[7:39:20] <%EldritchBee> You basically HAVE to stagger her
[7:39:24] <+SaintSalted> bigger LUL
[7:39:24] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Unga that Bunga
[7:39:26] <+Huderga> the boss that makes everyone change their gameplay up
[7:39:26] <%Valdorick> It may also be good time to pick a weapon for +10
[7:39:26] <TwistParabola> BEEG
[7:39:26] <halfmasks> HUGE QUEST ACTIVATED
[7:39:26] <+swesterly> @X2Eliah that guy earlier was like "how did this give anyone any trouble" and he used moonveil and summoned lmao
[7:39:27] <+LandOfTheWay> time to kill a god
[7:39:28] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> Tiche is also good here
[7:39:30] <Sol_Install> MMMM
[7:39:31] <%Felhad> Someone managed to no-hit Soul Level 1 this today
[7:39:32] <Sol_Install> BIGGER
[7:39:32] <@QueequegTheater> meowriiiOmegaLUL
[7:39:37] <@QueequegTheater> BIGGER.GIF
[7:39:37] <digaogrunge> Chain stagger
[7:39:41] <AtisutoCurry> SHES CAUTOUS
[7:39:44] <@DakotaMacDoodle> the blade of night and flame +10 got me through this fight.
[7:39:44] <%nip_nips> BIGGER
[7:39:47] <fumbles_tho> not so big
[7:39:50] <$realm_forge> More......MORE
[7:39:52] <Mitchellsocks> I used Moonveil and Mimic and it STILL took me like 25 tries
[7:39:54] <+imthinkingdarbys> *jeff gerstmann voice* BIGGER
[7:39:55] <Omenaire_> who?
[7:39:57] <sjcodan> I went into the game blind, how the fuck was I suposed to know Moonveil was some kinda cheese weapon?
[7:39:58] <RubberFistFight> she is malenia, blade of miquella
[7:39:58] <%watts121> Yeah Blasphemous is better
[7:39:59] <%nip_nips> MORE unga bunga
[7:40:00] <majindusto> BECOME  BIGGER
[7:40:00] <%tetraes> look at this Sekiro Shit
[7:40:01] <Sigma_190_Beta> She is Malenia.
[7:40:03] <TwistParabola> unupgraded?
[7:40:04] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> But you didi better
[7:40:05] <TwistParabola> She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella.
[7:40:07] <Sigma_190_Beta> Blade of Miquella.
[7:40:07] <T_Sasquatch> @felhad saw a Japanese player parrry the fuck out of her
[7:40:08] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Try dual wield
[7:40:08] <halfmasks> NOT BIG ENOUGH
[7:40:08] <+BubbaRands> BIGGER but s m o l
[7:40:09] <+LandOfTheWay> burn the rot away
[7:40:10] <%Noogiez> hit that bitch wit a rock
[7:40:11] <%EldritchBee> @DakotaMacDoodle Well yeah cus it's the Blade of Night and Flame
[7:40:11] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Malenia
[7:40:11] <%Niney_Who> Fire and Bleed mainly
[7:40:11] <%theeffay> She's pretty weak to bleed
[7:40:13] <+AyupaPupa> hesitation is defeat
[7:40:13] <XxMoliciousxX> better range
[7:40:13] <oda_flobunaga> BLEED
[7:40:14] <NewWillinium> Burning the Rot away sounds nice
[7:40:14] <42nfl19> your first sword was in the 700's that thign was in teh 500's
[7:40:14] <%fanciful_fright> Rivers of Blood with Mimic Tear did this on for me
[7:40:14] <%shootbang_exe> bleed is also super good if you have it
[7:40:17] <boostergoldz> the l2 r2 on night and fire prob does easy 2k
[7:40:17] <AtisutoCurry> She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella.
[7:40:19] <+sermittens> I used pure physical and bleed
[7:40:19] <%boggsz12> also maybe upgrade it to 10
[7:40:20] <Sol_Install> GO BIGGER
[7:40:20] <@Spydurman> double scythes?
[7:40:21] <%luftraumm1> that blade being bad is such a bummer
[7:40:21] <coziestbank> Isn't Black Flame good against Demi Gods?
[7:40:21] <Ghufufin> isnt there an anti heal something?
[7:40:21] <MooCartoons> Pat just grow three feet and beat her
[7:40:24] <%EldritchBee> She melts to bleed
[7:40:24] <%strakillias> try making it +10 and use tha poke
[7:40:25] <signofzeta> fire, bleed and frost are alright against her
[7:40:26] <%EldritchBee> most bosses do
[7:40:27] <+gamemas10> black blade dagger weapon art helped me with this
[7:40:27] <digaogrunge> Get mimic and overwhelm her
[7:40:28] <Vermillion129> @DakotaMacDoodle is there anything that sword cant get through LUL
[7:40:28] <+Nomenanza> you'd think something that says "GODSLAYING BLADE" would be more effective
[7:40:30] <sothatsprettybrutal> hit her with scarlet rot maybe she loves it _too_ much
[7:40:31] <+target227> @PatStaresAt cold is the best for her
[7:40:31] <$realm_forge> EVEN BIGGER
[7:40:31] <MoustacheCEO> Malenia and Radahn being bullshit superbosses cause they're so strong in the lore is so fucking good
[7:40:34] <armadaofghosts> Burn out the Rot.
[7:40:34] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> No ash of war?
[7:40:35] <+Rigid_Digidi> try throwing a rock
[7:40:36] <+Kensun7> Bleed + frost
[7:40:39] <+blitz31295> @Mitchellsocks i see another man of culture as well
[7:40:40] <$OfficerMods> black monk amon actually helps alot in this fight if you can stagger her
[7:40:45] <%Pookiedaexzile> Why Not Dual Wield
[7:40:46] <Omenaire_> or until you win
[7:40:47] <Sigma_190_Beta> @digaogrunge Mimic is just another healing fountain for her.
[7:40:48] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> @Nomenanza I'm saying
[7:40:50] <%Valdorick> *10 hours later*
[7:40:50] <%watts121> You can also parry her...but it's not worth it IMO.
[7:40:51] <+swesterly> yeah bleed is helpful if you aren't summoning
[7:40:51] <%Maids4lyfe> @digaogrunge he tried that, mimic just healed her more
[7:40:55] <buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut> Sheldon ring
[7:40:56] <halfmasks> @Nomenanza malenia is a demi god so its only half effective
[7:40:56] <ArgentUndaCova> I cheesed her out with mimics and a fire weapon art that has stupid stagger mopK
[7:41:00] <thesaverofhumens> she's miyazaki's waifu
[7:41:06] <cavefishes> good luck my man
[7:41:07] <Omenaire_> @buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut BAZINGA
[7:41:08] <TwistParabola> She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella.
[7:41:10] <Sigma_190_Beta> Malenia is She.
[7:41:11] <sappinmahbinyot> damn she really do be malenia blade of miquella
[7:41:11] <%Pookiedaexzile> Dual Wield
[7:41:12] <AtisutoCurry> She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella.
[7:41:13] <NewWillinium> So I rocked Malenia's Helm, and Mohg's Robe for the last bits of the game. And MAN is that such a fly ass fashion combo
[7:41:14] <turtlebits64> you can parry her but 9/10 she jumps away
[7:41:16] <+target227> @PatStaresAt cold is the best for her also helps slow her attacks
[7:41:17] <boostergoldz> mimic is a liability because it sits there, eats it and heals her
[7:41:20] <V0LK__> that phrase is gonna be ENGRAVED in our minds isn't it?
[7:41:23] <+crimsonomen0> Do we have a moral objection to summoning?
[7:41:24] <%justcallmebobplease> POWERSTANCE
[7:41:28] <buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut> @omenaire_ thank you
[7:41:28] <peachy996> You may not be tired yet but she is Malenia, Blade of Miquela
[7:41:29] <+MarkoTolstov> I used Mimic and just went to TOWN on her while she attacked him. She staggered so much it's crazy. Moonveil Katana OP
[7:41:29] <%Pookiedaexzile> YEYEYEYEYEEYEY
[7:41:30] <+Rigid_Digidi> pontiff mode
[7:41:30] <halfmasks> YEAH YEAH YEAH POWERSTANCE
[7:41:31] <TheSandmanIsHere> now imagine doing this with a mage build
[7:41:32] <boostergoldz> unless you stunlock her
[7:41:32] <digaogrunge> Time to get that +25 frost/bleed weapon
[7:41:33] <%X2Eliah> @PatStaresAt Maybe you have to respect completely into an int moonveil build for this
[7:41:35] <%nip_nips> @V0LK__ what phrase? Kappa
[7:41:37] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt If you dual wield with Mimic you can stunlock the shit out of her
[7:41:37] <halfmasks> PUT HER IN THE BLENDER
[7:41:38] <+FZeroDMX> Mimic is good if you put out HIGH dps, like moonveil bleeding and stagger level
[7:41:39] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> your summon will heal her, so you have to make up with the summon doing enough dmg (like tiche) or you taking advantage of the distraction
[7:41:39] <cavefishes> jumping L1 ENGAGE
[7:41:42] <thesaverofhumens> @crimsonomen0 summons will heal her
[7:41:43] <sjcodan> The mimic tear just healed her, he tried it
[7:41:44] <+Drigoooooo> if you use Mimic you have to be aggressive you have to cover it's back
[7:41:45] <RubberFistFight> is malenia still the blade of miquella, guys? i was afk for a minute
[7:41:46] <RED_LASH> has he gotten to the vergil phase?
[7:41:47] <%pabloelenano2> @crimsonomen0  the summon is healing her
[7:41:48] <TheSandmanIsHere> where anything with a casting time gets punished
[7:41:54] <%Felhad> I found tiche useful here, dodges a lot of attacks and is a good distraction
[7:41:55] <Sigma_190_Beta> Miquella of Blade, Malenia is She.
[7:41:55] <%Fenrisulfr_V> I ended up doing Rivers of Blood WA spam with my mimic to beat her.
[7:41:56] <+blitz31295> im excited for the next podcast where pat repeats her name for 4 hours
[7:41:56] <thesaverofhumens> much better
[7:41:56] <MooCartoons> just use your feminine charms on her
[7:41:57] <@DakotaMacDoodle> @EldritchBee Rivers of Blood also does a great job
[7:42:00] <RubberFistFight> SHE'S SO AWESOME OH MY GOD
[7:42:00] <V0LK__> @nip_nips you will hear it in some seconds LUL
[7:42:00] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt try incantations, I cheesed her with me and my mimic being JUST spellcasters
[7:42:01] <+CherteuseKapibara> :)
[7:42:02] <Vermillion129> what was better pat?
[7:42:02] <@QueequegTheater> She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella
[7:42:03] <%tetraes> dodge in away not in
[7:42:05] <TwistParabola> She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella.
[7:42:06] <%fanciful_fright> Sideroll
[7:42:08] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> Tiche is better than the mimic on this one because she can dodge and knock her down super easily
[7:42:10] <+Tredecian> roll toward her
[7:42:10] <%DashXero> The sound is somewhat different.
[7:42:11] <%luftraumm1> dodge in
[7:42:11] <+Huderga> dodge in
[7:42:11] <Grunkle_Dan_> i roll in
[7:42:13] <sjcodan> Baricade shield
[7:42:14] <sothatsprettybrutal> you should slide into different pieces after she does that move
[7:42:15] <rosabellamelantha> She hasn't even done the big anime attack yet
[7:42:16] <sappinmahbinyot> dodge to her right
[7:42:16] <oda_flobunaga> DODGE IN
[7:42:17] <%boggsz12> dosge in not back
[7:42:17] <@QueequegTheater> Roll forward
[7:42:17] <%shootbang_exe> dodge in
[7:42:17] <+swesterly> roll towards her to the side
[7:42:17] <%dcentii> Mimic works you just have to be hyper aggressive
[7:42:18] <no123450n> watch for the sparks
[7:42:18] <Sigma_190_Beta> She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella.
[7:42:18] <+LandOfTheWay> dodge forward, right past her
[7:42:18] <%nip_nips> @V0LK__ i must've missed it, still no idea who this boss is
[7:42:19] <TwistParabola> roll in
[7:42:19] <+Akizea> she has a lot of moves that punish you rolling away
[7:42:19] <candidateplays> when she does the tell for that, you can roll either left or right
[7:42:20] <%UltraViolet371> I dodge to 2:00
[7:42:20] <turtlebits64> thankfully I already had a moonveil build and it still took me about an hour
[7:42:21] <sjcodan> Roll in
[7:42:22] <%X2Eliah> dodge almost in
[7:42:22] <D4N5T3P> dodge in
[7:42:22] <MartyFun11> I read that you need to sideroll most of her attacks
[7:42:22] <cavefishes> get behind ideally
[7:42:23] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> bloodhound step
[7:42:23] <Gimplock> Dodge Left in
[7:42:23] <Ethel9727> If there's the  spark, you have to roll through. If there isn't, you can roll back or in.
[7:42:24] <NanoHologuise> roll in
[7:42:25] <thesaverofhumens> to her right
[7:42:25] <some_brave_apollo> dig up
[7:42:28] <sjcodan> But also baricade shield
[7:42:28] <%watts121> DO NOT DO BARRICADE SHIELD
[7:42:28] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt her dash moves have not great tracking so dodge into and past her
[7:42:29] <halfmasks> Tiche might be able to dodge her moves
[7:42:29] <%whyskeywolfe> You're dodging in.
[7:42:29] <WillSin4Cash> in or side
[7:42:30] <Finchit> the triple slash you dodge in
[7:42:31] <$TzarSalad> I roll in, out with the other crazy move
[7:42:31] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt ok for the quick 3-strike, you can sort of dodge past her forwards if you time it right. For the looooong chargeup stab, it's a regular dodge/roll.
[7:42:32] <cavefishes> bosses love punishing back rolls
[7:42:33] <+Nomenanza> I have no idea because my strat was to just stunlock her with mimic wielding collosal weapon and pray to jesus
[7:42:35] <Gimplock> not were the blades stops but were it starts
[7:42:35] <boostergoldz> on the stinger? dodge in and it's an easy punish.
[7:42:37] <Sigma_190_Beta> Miquella of Blade, Malenia is She.
[7:42:38] <Omenaire_> perfect
[7:42:39] <rudiciuscaesar> wow, almost 8 hours, crush it Pat.
[7:42:40] <bassoontyphoon> Lore wise doesn’t Tiche make sense here?
[7:42:41] <RickyRelucent> give it a second
[7:42:42] <%DashXero> Right.
[7:42:43] <sothatsprettybrutal> PERFECT
[7:42:43] <RickyRelucent> c :
[7:42:45] <TwistParabola> She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella.
[7:42:45] <%Cozy90> She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella.
[7:42:47] <D4N5T3P> I just finished this fight, it took me like 5 hours LUL
[7:42:47] <+Tredecian> sparks her hand yeah
[7:42:50] <halfmasks> yes
[7:42:52] <%The_0_2_Hero> Yeah, I did it with the mimic and chaining jump attacks to stun her and keep her from murdering it
[7:42:53] <TwistParabola> yeah
[7:42:53] <%EldritchBee> Be wary, she can heal off ghosts too
[7:42:54] <%luftraumm1> cocks
[7:42:58] <@QueequegTheater> She has a tell on all her biggest attacks, yeah
[7:42:59] <RickyRelucent> download: 36%
[7:42:59] <%Monkeyweed21> she Exceeds her arm
[7:43:00] <RubberFistFight> Better suck a red bull into your butt Pat, you're gonna be here awhile.
[7:43:00] <Sigma_190_Beta> @bassoontyphoon Tiche would be bodied here.
[7:43:01] <%watts121> Yeah her moves have tells. Has he seen her wombo combo yet
[7:43:02] <Ethel9727> No, she has a spark version of the flurry and a nonspark  that have different timings and movement
[7:43:02] <TwistParabola> because it's a prosthetic, it has no hilt
[7:43:03] <$OfficerMods> barricade shield also helps too, yeah she heals but if you keep slapping her she'll get staggard and can't keep up
[7:43:03] <+swesterly> @bassoontyphoon idk but it makes sense cheese wise
[7:43:06] <oda_flobunaga> This fight took me 2 days
[7:43:07] <T_Sasquatch> I 😇 am 👏 Malenia, Blade 🔪  of  😞 Miquella
[7:43:08] <+crimsonomen0> Miquella is not a boys name.
[7:43:08] <%Niney_Who> She Transforms her hunter weapon yes
[7:43:09] <+ReallyBigRocks> who's this?
[7:43:12] <+pkmamsters> Male Nia, Blade of Milktoast
[7:43:13] <+joker626> yeah pat might be in for a ride and a half
[7:43:16] <%whyskeywolfe> @bassoontyphoon Tiche makes this fight a lot easier, I assume he's just trying to learn it first.
[7:43:16] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> tiche makes up for the healing with the dmg
[7:43:17] <Omenaire_> STICK AND MOVE
[7:43:18] <%X2Eliah> pat
[7:43:19] <%nip_nips> @watts121 he hasnt seen IT yet
[7:43:20] <%X2Eliah> this is pat
[7:43:20] <@DakotaMacDoodle> @PatStaresAt Side roll is better then back roll for a lot of her moves
[7:43:20] <candidateplays> It is in this world
[7:43:21] <NewWillinium> Tiche is good here ONLY because she is so mobile of a Spirit. She hits hard and doesn't stay the fuck still for Malenia to get heals off of her
[7:43:22] <@QueequegTheater> @bassoontyphoon Tiche is made of paper compared to Mimic, and Mimic gets fucked
[7:43:25] <%dcentii> im waiting for the actual sick shit
[7:43:31] <+pittbulldogg> I found mimic helped and just stagger the hell out of her.... she still has 2 moves that i pray the mimic gets
[7:43:33] <MicrotonalMatt> Somehow she bugged out and insta-died for me after two hours at it and I feel cheated
[7:43:36] <$TzarSalad> pat not using spirit ashes?
[7:43:39] <%EldritchBee> Can't wait for him to see The Move
[7:43:39] <Sigma_190_Beta> @pkmamsters Ah, you may not know. She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella.
[7:43:45] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> depends on the mimic build
[7:43:46] <thesaverofhumens> I can't wait to see pats reaction to the second phase
[7:43:49] <RickyRelucent> download: 42%
[7:43:51] <%EldritchBee> @TzarSalad She heals too much off them
[7:43:54] <+Rigid_Digidi> Has she used waterfowl yet?
[7:43:55] <%dcentii> mimic is real gud you just gotta spam r1 pretty much
[7:43:56] <%Niney_Who> Shut up
[7:43:57] <%whyskeywolfe> @QueequegTheater Tiche is actually very good here. She dodges a lot and won't hold aggro much.
[7:43:58] <sirrice77> tiche is hit or miss, depends on how she attacks and whether or not she gets hit by anime slash
[7:44:00] <sjcodan> Don't fucking spoil it
[7:44:01] <RubberFistFight> @QueequegTheater the frustrating thing is mimic can allow you to stunlock her and get easy staggers but MAN is the healing thing a pita
[7:44:02] <+anoldtoilet> hey that was Loretta's move.
[7:44:04] <Omenaire_> ranged summons would draw her away
[7:44:04] <bassoontyphoon> @queequegtheater I just mean Tiche has a blade designed to kill demigods so it would make sense here right?
[7:44:05] <%Niney_Who> No spoiling anything
[7:44:05] <+RealMichaelPhelps> progress!
[7:44:07] <%EldritchBee> Powerstance Jump Attacks are how I did this
[7:44:08] <+RushUnplugged> @crimsonomen0 neither was Gwyndolyn, there's a pattern
[7:44:08] <%watts121> IMO Mimic does fine if your build is power stancing heavy weapons. Lhutel also does good here.
[7:44:10] <%fanciful_fright> DANGER UNLOCKED
[7:44:10] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> @bassoontyphoon But the black flame deal a lot of damage, and she has a lot of moves that knock her down
[7:44:14] <+Nomenanza> good rng so far
[7:44:15] <+swesterly> so this is melina blade of michael right?
[7:44:16] <TwistParabola> is she gonna use it?
[7:44:17] <%whyskeywolfe> Here comes the big one.

[7:44:46] <%dekkitout> Tiche- you're up to bat
[7:44:47] <Sigma_190_Beta> \She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella.
[7:44:48] <oda_flobunaga> YEP
[7:44:49] <thesaverofhumens> all you can do is run
[7:44:49] <%Willowight> she turns into a tornado, huh
[7:44:49] <%watts121> Except hers actually has power armor.
[7:44:49] <+Drigoooooo> the most broken boss move
[7:44:50] <cavefishes> her weapon is SO SICK
[7:44:50] <TwistParabola> yeah
[7:44:50] <Zebroneath> that move is the most bs
[7:44:52] <%Niney_Who> Dodge a fucking blender
[7:44:53] <sirrice77> @PatStaresAt so that move can just happen anytime in the fight after she hits 70%
[7:44:53] <AtisutoCurry> She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella.
[7:44:54] <halfmasks> ANIME BULLSHIT GO
[7:44:56] <Sigma_190_Beta> Miquella of Blade, Malenia is She.
[7:44:56] <%luftraumm1> that's dmc bullshit
[7:44:56] <%whyskeywolfe> WFD bitchesss
[7:44:56] <+HuoShengdi> Millicent was using it too
[7:44:56] <sjcodan> MAYBE BARICADE SHIELD THAT, WHO KNOWS
[7:44:56] <rudiciuscaesar> I also love how that attack clipped Pat and did 80% of his HP
[7:44:57] <%Maids4lyfe> TREESUS CHRIST
[7:44:57] <%geekjacob> metal gear rising plays
[7:44:58] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> That's just a Sekiro move on a souls game
[7:44:59] <tolloponik> cant run from it BTW Kappa
[7:45:00] <T_Sasquatch> Dude you're fighting a dmc character
[7:45:01] <sothatsprettybrutal> the slap chop

[7:45:01] <Vermillion129> HELL YEA TICHE
[7:45:02] <thesaverofhumens> @rudiciuscaesar she heals on EVERY hit she lands
[7:45:04] <Sunstalker> malenia, Blender of miquella
[7:45:05] <NewWillinium> I usually had the Spirit Summon tank that move or avoided it as best I can by panic rolling and or running straight away from her
[7:45:06] <sjcodan> Literally SPRINT away from that move
[7:45:06] <Finchit> woolie is gonna fucking love that when he gets here some time next year
[7:45:07] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt That move takes like 30% of Mimic's health
[7:45:09] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @PatStaresAt Her weapon takes 48 Dex to use too lmao
[7:45:09] <Eye_of_the_red_giant> I 😇 am 👏 Malenia, Blade 🔪 of 😞 Miquella
[7:45:11] <%Valdorick> She dodges... Tiche's blackflame.
[7:45:11] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt Barricade Shield that move
[7:45:12] <TheSandmanIsHere> yeah her remembrance is worth duping
[7:45:12] <RubberFistFight> @rudiciuscaesar because they heal her. it's a tradeoff. some people do better without them.
[7:45:12] <+imthinkingdarbys> does Tiche inflict bleed?
[7:45:15] <+anoldtoilet> uhhhhh THATS some damage
[7:45:19] <%SveriSageAdvice> holy shit what, she takes rot damage???
[7:45:20] <+Drigoooooo> if she didn't have that move she would be a 10/10 fight
[7:45:21] <+anoldtoilet> what the fuck was that DOT
[7:45:22] <Paperware> sometimes it's just better to eat the healing and block the super combo
[7:45:24] <%Valdorick> She also BENEFITS from the health reduction.
[7:45:24] <+anoldtoilet> whoaaaaa
[7:45:25] <T_Sasquatch> @finchit 😂

[7:45:41] <%DashXero> How the fuck do you even deal with that?
[7:45:42] <42nfl19> YOU GOT TO PHASE 2 FASTER!
[7:45:42] <Sunstalker> So if you msitraven that big move? She just fucking combos you to death in the air anyway?

[7:45:46] <T_Sasquatch> I 😇 am 👏 Malenia, Blade 🔪  of  😞 Miquella.
[7:45:46] <+Nomenanza> NO ONE KNOWS
[7:45:47] <+Kinggarbage> What the
[7:45:47] <sjcodan> LITERALLY RUN
[7:45:47] <%strakillias> Tiche is back on top
[7:45:47] <%Pookiedaexzile> Away
[7:45:47] <Vermillion129> @PatStaresAt you can attack her while she's on the ground btw
[7:45:48] <RubberFistFight> best strategy people have found for that one is just fucking run your ass off if she goes in the air
[7:45:48] <+SaintSalted> to hell
[7:45:48] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> To sleep
[7:45:48] <sothatsprettybrutal> home
[7:45:48] <halfmasks> GET YO ASS MIXED UP
[7:45:49] <RubberFistFight> just RUN
[7:45:49] <+BahaPrisdimee> run or roll into her
[7:45:49] <T_Sasquatch> Run
[7:45:49] <Sigma_190_Beta> @PatStaresAt Unlock, and Run.
[7:45:50] <sjcodan> LIKE, SPRINT
[7:45:50] <digaogrunge> IT WORKS
[7:45:51] <%EldritchBee> One in, two out, one in
[7:45:51] <rudiciuscaesar> can a greatshield help?
[7:45:51] <%dekkitout> That flurry can be done in triplets? Why?
[7:45:51] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt you need to run
[7:45:52] <tolloponik> nowhere
[7:45:53] <mike2hands> SHE'S malenia blade of milataka
[7:45:53] <%Maids4lyfe> away
[7:45:53] <%watts121> for the Wombo Combo you have to run.
[7:45:53] <NewWillinium> You run straight back away from her. Or get lucky with your rolls
[7:45:53] <%X2Eliah> @PatStaresAt you go Hollow, thats where
[7:45:54] <some_brave_apollo> you just hope she does it to your summon
[7:45:55] <+chimaera24> Run away
[7:45:55] <+swesterly> sprint away from the first two flurries and roll towards her during the last
[7:45:55] <%sporeian94> here's the trick, you gotta run away from it for the first two slash combos, then the third redirect and roll away
[7:45:55] <%SveriSageAdvice> you can dodge through it if you have the right timing but itt sucks ass
[7:45:55] <RickyRelucent> in the direction of safety
[7:45:56] <RubberFistFight> leg it clear to the other side of the room
[7:45:56] <boostergoldz> you can't run from it consistently either
[7:45:56] <TwistParabola> RUN
[7:45:57] <%theeffay> I have no idea how you're supposed to dodge the virgil slash without bloodhound dash
[7:45:57] <%justcallmebobplease> Maybe you have to barricade block it?
[7:45:57] <$TzarSalad> you can time the roll but its hard af
[7:45:58] <candidateplays> I beat her and I don't know how to dodge the first part of that move
[7:45:58] <Midnight188> how do u dodge that
[7:45:58] <@QueequegTheater> Into the ground
[7:45:58] <pi_in_the_sci> away
[7:45:58] <cavefishes> you CAN dodge it but it's hard as fuck
[7:45:58] <+gunbusted> run from the first 2 volleys dodge in on the 3rd
[7:45:58] <$HyperionXV> Run from first part, dodge in to second half
[7:45:59] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt Barricade Shield
[7:45:59] <%dcentii> @PatStaresAt waterfowl dance has to either be blocked/used on a summon or perfectly dodged or it will kill you
[7:46:00] <%whyskeywolfe> You gotta be running when you see her jump
[7:46:00] <thesaverofhumens> just run
[7:46:01] <%greasypete00> also why would she not just always do that move against her enemies
[7:46:02] <pi_in_the_sci> you go away
[7:46:03] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt either run away or roll past it
[7:46:03] <%luftraumm1> probably run, or dash through AND run
[7:46:04] <bassoontyphoon> Run
[7:46:05] <$realm_forge> Dam girl...
[7:46:05] <+Rigid_Digidi> Sprint out for two and roll back for the third flurry
[7:46:05] <+RushUnplugged> you can both dodge the whole chain, and block it
[7:46:07] <+Nomenanza> You summon mimic and pray it targets them
[7:46:08] <+leviting> elsewhere
[7:46:09] <Zebroneath> you either perfect frame dodge or run the fuck away
[7:46:09] <RubberFistFight> Run and also pray.
[7:46:09] <%nip_nips> run and pray to rngesus
[7:46:09] <MoustacheCEO> You need to run but you'll still probably die to it
[7:46:10] <Eye_of_the_red_giant> I 😇 am 👏 Malenia, Blade 🔪 of 😞 Miquella
[7:46:11] <%Valdorick> When she jumps in the air, run away from her for the first 2, then roll toward her as she starts the third
[7:46:11] <Paranoid_Jumbotron> running doesnt work, chat
[7:46:15] <rudiciuscaesar> treat it like dragon fire and just run away?
[7:46:15] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> You can dodge if you roll into her, but the timing is super tight
[7:46:16] <T_Sasquatch> Sometimes you just fucking run away
[7:46:17] <sjcodan> Sprinting in fights is super good in this game
[7:46:17] <+joker626> yeah run and dodge for the 3rd one
[7:46:19] <%EldritchBee> Dodge inwards for the first one, outwards for the rest
[7:46:20] <+Nomenanza> Running is also not always consistent, you WILL get hit
[7:46:24] <sirrice77> You sprint away for the first two then roll towards her for the last
[7:46:25] <%shootbang_exe> @PatStaresAt unironically run away during the windup and she'll miss the first 2, then you can either dodge or handle the last one
[7:46:26] <+swesterly> @Paranoid_Jumbotron yes it does
[7:46:27] <+Grayhammatter> go tiche go!
[7:46:28] <+RushUnplugged> it is actually surprisingly fair, considering it's a combo from hell
[7:46:30] <MoustacheCEO> @Paranoid_Jumbotron You run from the first 2 then the 3rd goes behind you
[7:46:36] <RubberFistFight> this has taken some people upwards of 200 attempts
[7:46:40] <RickyRelucent> Pat is thirsty
[7:46:40] <+gamemas10> lots of her moves require you to Dodge towards her
[7:46:43] <RED_LASH> run from first burst, dodge into 2nd, 3rd will miss
[7:46:43] <%luftraumm1> tiche seems extra good here
[7:46:44] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> PAT IS TWO HANING IT
[7:46:44] <+Drigoooooo> I just blocked it even if she heals I can just take it back
[7:46:44] <+Rigid_Digidi> A greatshield also helps
[7:46:45] <+kaztinka> Tiche is dominating PogChamp
[7:46:47] <XxMoliciousxX> Tiche is like STOP HEALING HER
[7:46:48] <RickyRelucent> He did so well last try
[7:46:48] <some_brave_apollo> i feel like she would be really easy with another human player because it seems like she swaps aggro on hit, so you could just back and forth the whole thing
[7:46:50] <turtlebits64> dodge right after each flurry
[7:46:50] <%fanciful_fright> RUN
[7:46:52] <%CopperTucker> is she the new Fume Knight
[7:46:53] <+OneTrueAsshat> Sprint away for the first, dodge in, then backwards
[7:46:53] <thesaverofhumens> Kappa
[7:46:54] <T_Sasquatch> YEYEYEYEYEYE
[7:46:56] <rudiciuscaesar> her healing is super significant too, you guys weren't joking...
[7:46:56] <RubberFistFight> LOOK AT THOSE NUMBERS THOUGH
[7:47:01] <Vermillion129> Bruh I got stab by the dash while doing something and she deal 1.4k damage on me
[7:47:03] <RubberFistFight> shes got like a bazillion health
[7:47:04] <%watts121> damn Tiche is bullying the fuck outta her
[7:47:04] <thesaverofhumens> here it comes
[7:47:04] <penitentpendant> Praise the godkilling assassin!
[7:47:06] <TheSandmanIsHere> stop making the fight harder for your summon
[7:47:10] <%Niney_Who> Tiche is OP
[7:47:11] <+Rigid_Digidi> Your holding TIche back
[7:47:11] <RickyRelucent> download: 51,0
[7:47:13] <sappinmahbinyot> There's multiple ways to dodge it. All of them are hard or have tradeoffs.
[7:47:13] <+imthinkingdarbys> Tiche is doing work
[7:47:13] <+anoldtoilet> bro what the fuck is that damage over time effect
[7:47:14] <boostergoldz> damn black knife summon helps a lot
[7:47:15] <Vermillion129> GO TICHE GO
[7:47:17] <+anoldtoilet> is that tiche's god killer
[7:47:18] <RickyRelucent> FUG I
[7:47:19] <%EldritchBee> Tiche doing good work, damn
[7:47:20] <RickyRelucent> LETS GOOO
[7:47:20] <+blitz31295> damn, tiche kinda bodying her
[7:47:21] <NewWillinium> I wonder if Tiche will be getting nerfed in the future
[7:47:22] <+lord_sykos> Tiche is putting in work
[7:47:22] <TwistParabola> lets go TICHE
[7:47:24] <RubberFistFight> also her stagger is super short
[7:47:25] <TheBlankAce> Tiche is helping so much
[7:47:25] <sjcodan> GO TICHE
[7:47:28] <%watts121> RUMN
[7:47:28] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> bloodhound step makes that undodgable attack managable
[7:47:28] <+kaztinka> he's insane PogChamp
[7:47:29] <+AyupaPupa> lol
[7:47:29] <%Eldalu> tiche is practically carrying pat
[7:47:30] <ArgentUndaCova> mopD
[7:47:31] <RickyRelucent> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[7:47:31] <%watts121> Run lol
[7:47:33] <Finchit> nah dog RUN away
[7:47:33] <%greasypete00> imagine the randomizers with this woman
[7:47:34] <%NBUsagi> Well shit
[7:47:35] <%watts121> I knew when it was coming
[7:47:35] <%justcallmebobplease> Pat, gotta run from it.
[7:47:36] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Why didnt you run lol
[7:47:36] <V0LK__> black knife is DOING WORK
[7:47:38] <RickyRelucent> better each try!
[7:47:38] <mike2hands> BOI
[7:47:40] <mrtanaka111> lol what
[7:47:40] <+swesterly> sprint from the first two, roll into the 3rd pat
[7:47:40] <+gamemas10> that one dodge towards her
[7:47:40] <Gimplock> That attack was sick
[7:47:41] <penitentpendant> Good try Tiche
[7:47:41] <TwistParabola> She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella.
[7:47:41] <@QueequegTheater> Stop dodging, JUST RUN
[7:47:41] <%justcallmebobplease> Use the power of cowardice!
[7:47:42] <TheHotStuven> so close almost free
[7:47:43] <Sigma_190_Beta> Just run.
[7:47:43] <rudiciuscaesar> is there even a noticeable start up lol
[7:47:43] <+Rigid_Digidi> Tiche is the real main character
[7:47:43] <RickyRelucent> download: 68%
[7:47:43] <halfmasks> THATS A BIG ASS TELEGRAPH THO
[7:47:43] <%DashXero> Tiche puttin' in WORK.
[7:47:45] <TheBlankAce> You just gotta dodge octoslash
[7:47:45] <+swesterly> not roll into the attack
[7:47:45] <%MrMegaJackpots> away away
[7:47:46] <doster504> yea just roll into it totally works
[7:47:47] <sjcodan> RUN LIKE FUCK
[7:47:47] <%theeffay> The virgil slash is the only thing she does when she jumps like that
[7:47:47] <+Tredecian> shes more likly to do that move after getting knocked down
[7:47:48] <%watts121> You always have to respect her jump.
[7:47:48] <$OfficerMods> bloodhound step helps alot in this fight
[7:47:48] <%whyskeywolfe> You can techincally roll through that, but it's wildly difficult.
[7:47:49] <%Maids4lyfe> why no run
[7:47:50] <digaogrunge> its workinh tho
[7:47:51] <markdreizehn> Pat finally realized you need to get her corner locked
[7:47:51] <sappinmahbinyot> First attack CANNOT be i-framed. Every subsequent attack can. You have to avoid first one by running.
[7:47:53] <sothatsprettybrutal> my favorite is the 4 more times you'd have died that she keeps going after
[7:47:54] <%dcentii> its run then dodge in the n dodge to the side
[7:47:54] <+gamemas10> yea and black knife!!!
[7:47:55] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Also Pat why dont you heal to full? Is there a trick to that
[7:47:55] <%theeffay> There's no mixup, just start sprinting
[7:47:56] <@QueequegTheater> @RickyRelucent No
[7:47:56] <%tetraes> if she hoverin  start sprinting lol
[7:47:57] <Sigma_190_Beta> Stop Dodging, that Stamina can be used to run.
[7:47:57] <%watts121> If she goes in the air make distance.
[7:47:58] <+RushUnplugged> the leap back fucks everyone up because the delay ALMOST lets you get a hit in, but then she starts
[7:47:58] <boostergoldz> imagine the replace every enemy with melania runs
[7:47:58] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt you cant roll into her you have to roll PAST her each time she changes direction
[7:48:00] <RubberFistFight> @I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I thing is it's not undodgeable. I can dodge the first two. Problem is you have to dodge them all, perfectly, and it goes on for like 5 seconds.
[7:48:02] <Evendrag> the rykard sword attack knocks her to the ground
[7:48:03] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt Barricade Shield will keep you alive
[7:48:05] <RickyRelucent> Kinda, maybe
[7:48:05] <%luftraumm1> I think that a soon as she floats a while you run away fast
[7:48:06] <Midnight188> you have to not be in the same post code as that, got it
[7:48:06] <T_Sasquatch> Black knives killed a God. They can handle it LUL
[7:48:06] <RickyRelucent> ish.
[7:48:14] <XxMoliciousxX> GET THE CANNON!
[7:48:19] <sappinmahbinyot> @Midnight188 basically LUL
[7:48:21] <sjcodan> Baricade shield can just tank it, although she heals a bit
[7:48:24] <+Nomenanza> it is a big telegraph but personally I found it looks too similar to her other aerial slams by the time you realise it's different you are dead
[7:48:24] <+OneTrueAsshat> You have to read that she’s gonna go for it when she’s in the air to have the time to sprint away
[7:48:26] <%dekkitout> 1 sec
[7:48:27] <+Rigid_Digidi> hammer time
[7:48:27] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt if you try and use collosal weapons you WILL die
[7:48:27] <%MrMegaJackpots> she heals on block
[7:48:28] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> ERD TREE SLAM
[7:48:28] <RubberFistFight> yeah the second she goes up in the air you need to glue your ass to the complete other side of the arena
[7:48:29] <rudiciuscaesar> colossal weapon is a good description for a weapon
[7:48:30] <+Huderga> @oda_flobunaga and give her all her life back
[7:48:33] <T_Sasquatch> You're either blocking that or dodging it
[7:48:34] <%kknutson4> pop that mixed flask that  absorbs a hit maybe?
[7:48:35] <%dekkitout> Pulling out the stop sign
[7:48:35] <RickyRelucent> the beyblade move is a doozy
[7:48:36] <%watts121> I'm gonna upgrade Tiche to lvl 10 on my next character, he's bampf.
[7:48:36] <digaogrunge> YOU WANNA BE HUGE
[7:48:37] <Vermillion129> Tiche is my wife Kappa
[7:48:39] <@QueequegTheater> @rosabellamelantha I beat her with colossal weapons
[7:48:40] <RickyRelucent> let her r i p
[7:48:42] <MoustacheCEO> That move is honestly just a tilter you can dodge it most times but it's hard to get consistent
[7:48:51] <halfmasks> Stop, Hammer Time
[7:48:52] <%Valdorick> But isn't it Holy damage?
[7:48:53] <%watts121> I got her too late to upgrade on my first game.
[7:48:53] <it_came_from_outer_space> I wonder what dragonbolt buff with a barricade greatshield would do to her
[7:48:56] <+gamemas10> no pat don't go slow weapon
[7:49:00] <RickyRelucent> ehh, win some lose some
[7:49:00] <boostergoldz> the hit absorb is one and the move is multi-hit it doesn't help
[7:49:02] <+anoldtoilet> lol
[7:49:04] <+anoldtoilet> erdtree time
[7:49:04] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> @kknutson4 It doesn't work on that move since its a multi hit one
[7:49:06] <+Rigid_Digidi> do it
[7:49:06] <Vermillion129> @rosabellamelantha you definitely can beat her with colossal yea, the stun is super useful vs her
[7:49:07] <%dcentii> barricade with any shield can block it if you can live with the fact she heals 25% from it
[7:49:08] <RubberFistFight> we're about to see some absolute "fling shit at the wall" tactics 😂
[7:49:08] <+SaintSalted> yea bigger and slower
[7:49:08] <T_Sasquatch> And by dodge i mean the old joestar technique
[7:49:10] <@QueequegTheater> Chat, slow weapons stunlock her
[7:49:11] <sjcodan> SLOW WEAPON LOL
[7:49:11] <+Nomenanza> Isnt she resistant to holy?
[7:49:14] <thesaverofhumens> NotLikeThis
[7:49:15] <+SaintSalted> lets gooo
[7:49:15] <+Grayhammatter> erdtree time
[7:49:16] <RubberFistFight> I've respecced twice trying to knock this bitch over
[7:49:16] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> @RubberFistFight "undodgable" as in there's literally not enough iframes to dodge through. without bloodhound step you need to run premptively far enough away. with it, you can just dodge back back forward each time
[7:49:17] <%luftraumm1> no
[7:49:18] <TwistParabola> you have 3 of those.
[7:49:19] <+anoldtoilet> yeah colossal seems like a good idea tbh
[7:49:22] <+anoldtoilet> holy maybe not
[7:49:22] <%theeffay> B O N K
[7:49:22] <digaogrunge> DO IT
[7:49:23] <%luftraumm1> nooo
[7:49:23] <Lulu19> you can plus ten your swords bruh
[7:49:24] <Evendrag> with the mimic i was able to loop knockdown her with the rykard sword
[7:49:24] <Gamer76255> Does the winged scythe's art stop her heal?
[7:49:24] <@QueequegTheater> You have 3 pat
[7:49:26] <TwistParabola> do as thou wilt
[7:49:32] <@QueequegTheater> @Gamer76255 nope
[7:49:32] <RickyRelucent> Mhm
[7:49:32] <oda_flobunaga> @Huderga no, not all.  If you are also using Bleed, her healing can be bursted back down super fast so blocking is worth it just to live
[7:49:33] <Khester824> Bloodhound step is really good for This
[7:49:35] <Paperware> radagon's soreseal also might be more a liability at this point
[7:49:36] <MoustacheCEO> @rosabellamelantha Starscourge Greatswords and a mimic made the fight bearable for me
[7:49:38] <%watts121> lol yeah see how it does at lvl 9 before you waste that Somber Dragon
[7:49:43] <Vermillion129> I know a guy who double collosal GS vs her using Bloodhound Step LUL
[7:49:46] <+anoldtoilet> lol pat
[7:49:46] <RickyRelucent> remember, 25 quick, 50 mid, 75 fat
[7:49:48] <RickyRelucent> c :
[7:49:50] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> More like Nerd Tree am I rght?
[7:49:51] <sappinmahbinyot> @I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I You can also run around the attack and i-frame the last of it but the positioning and timing are incredibly difficult
[7:49:51] <+RushUnplugged> you can absolutely bonk her with bigass weapons, she gets staggered
[7:49:54] <projecthazoid> B E C O M E W O O D
[7:49:55] <+anoldtoilet> @Vermillion129 lmfao
[7:49:57] <+gamemas10> yea. bloodhound step is bae

[7:54:23] <%Niney_Who> @thesaverofhumens You literally spoiled it earlier
[7:54:26] <+theoldone001> Its cause you're both gingers
[7:54:26] <%Valdorick> I say go back to Mimic Chan, if you're dual wielding.
[7:54:27] <%greasypete00> does the phase at least keep once you die to it
[7:54:27] <ErikFeral> that was a great run, so raw!!
[7:54:27] <MoustacheCEO> Every boss has a phase 2 in this game
[7:54:28] <SinisterBroccoli> does she bounce of shields with barricade?
[7:54:29] <nelsonq415> You interrupted her whirlwind attk once
[7:54:29] <bassoontyphoon> She has a phase 2???
[7:54:30] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> WHo didnt spoil at this point
[7:54:31] <%watts121> If you have the talisman that increases defense at max HP
[7:54:33] <V0LK__> cause chat can't shut up?
[7:54:34] <%Valdorick> Because she's a boss in Elden Ring?

[7:54:41] <sjcodan> LUL
[7:54:41] <@QueequegTheater> Kappa
[7:54:41] <+Edrem> the fact she heals off hitting your corpse is extra insulting
[7:54:43] <%dcentii> it has been way more than 5-7 attempts
[7:54:44] <boostergoldz> also everything in this game has a phase 2 lol
[7:54:45] <purple9z> now that you've seen it I beat her by basically stunlocking with takers flame
[7:54:45] <+anoldtoilet> love her music tbh
[7:54:46] <%whyskeywolfe> She doesn't have WFD in phase 2.

[7:56:07] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> You deserved that one

[7:56:15] <%fanciful_fright> She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella
[7:56:16] <RickyRelucent> she moves like owl and dodges like bloodborne, she has a sekiro weapon, she speared pat like ornstein
[7:56:18] <@QueequegTheater> She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella
[7:56:24] <%JustToWatch> Phase 69 where she tags in Sans Undertale is where it gets REALLY fucked
[7:56:25] <RickyRelucent> and she HEALS.
[7:56:25] <Khester824> Phase 3 tho
[7:56:27] <boostergoldz> of course how else will they top gael
[7:56:27] <Vermillion129> golden vow workds
[7:56:28] <cavefishes> oh yeah using Sacred Vow is always good
[7:56:30] <RickyRelucent> what is this game
[7:56:30] <%dcentii> She has never known defeat
[7:56:30] <$Jaxnos> i need you to beat this boss for me, Pat. so my soul can finally be put to rest and I can leave this mortal plane.
[7:56:31] <thesaverofhumens> she is the storm that is approaching
[7:56:32] <%vexion_smh> Pat do you know who she is? Kappa
[7:56:33] <+Nomenanza> damn what armour set is that tho
[7:56:35] <@DakotaMacDoodle> Malenia, Blade of Miquella.
[7:56:35] <+Nomenanza> looks sick
[7:56:35] <%boggsz12> also don't forget tiche
[7:56:36] <%luftraumm1> she is Malenia, blade of Miquella
[7:56:37] <%livi242> I want From to make a 10 phase boss fight and I'm not kidding
[7:56:37] <cavefishes> same with fire strength or whatever
[7:56:38] <boostergoldz> and isshin
[7:56:38] <mrtanaka111> try rotting her Kappa
[7:56:39] <%MrMegaJackpots> She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella
[7:56:40] <%kknutson4> what flask mix you use
[7:56:40] <+Rofiarf> phase 3 is easy compared to phase 5 though
[7:56:40] <+blitz31295> summon tiche  and use golden vow, gives him buff to
[7:56:42] <RickyRelucent> i mean they made the smough buttslam a weapon art
[7:56:43] <Khester824> EAT SOME BOILD CRAB
[7:56:47] <RickyRelucent> what is actually this game
[7:56:48] <%boggsz12> oh ok
[7:56:52] <$realm_forge> She is Bimblo. Blade of Schmimblo
[7:56:52] <cavefishes> golden vow is 1 minute
[7:56:55] <neoscremlass> this begs the question, is malenia super diesel BECAUSE she's a selfcest baby or DESPITE it?
[7:57:01] <dante_must_die_exe> big learn it
[7:57:02] <thesaverofhumens> this boss is the "fuck you, learn to dodge" boss
[7:57:05] <dante_must_die_exe> learn it big good
[7:57:05] <sappinmahbinyot> LABBING
[7:57:10] <%watts121> @NewWillinium when she uses it it's attached to her prosthetic so I'm guessing she doesn't really need the protection.
[7:57:10] <T_Sasquatch> I 😇 am 👏 Malenia, Blade 🔪  of  😞 Miquella. I 😇 am 👏 Malenia, Blade 🔪  of  😞 Miquella
[7:57:10] <Vermillion129> yeesh
[7:57:10] <%Valdorick> God, she just rushed down that time
[7:57:11] <%MrMegaJackpots> She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella
[7:57:13] <@QueequegTheater> She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella
[7:57:16] <%VivalaDragoon> I can’t believe the streamer is beating up his girlfriend live on stream
[7:57:17] <RickyRelucent> super diesel? no cuz she got no family
[7:57:20] <%EldritchBee> @neoscremlass Both
[7:57:21] <%fanciful_fright> She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella
[7:57:23] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> You learning Squidward?
[7:57:23] <%Call_Me_Deacon_Blues> Pat would never summon us to help
[7:57:24] <%jamsbybetty> her moveset is pretty simple but she's super fast and heals
[7:57:25] <RickyRelucent> Kappa
[7:57:25] <Sigma_190_Beta> Miquella of Blade, Malenia is She.
[7:57:26] <%tetraes> most of the time dodging past her is better than away
[7:57:27] <RubberFistFight> @QueequegTheater you sure about that/
[7:57:28] <%vexion_smh> She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella
[7:57:31] <%justcallmebobplease> justcallmebobplease subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 18 months, currently on a 18 month streak! Frost can work great on her - maybe try Hoarfrost Stomp or something.
[7:57:33] <+AyupaPupa> peepoG
[7:57:33] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> Is crazy that to beat phase 10 you need to T-pose her for 4 hours straight
[7:57:33] <halfmasks> What is the talisman he put on? it might not be helping
[7:57:35] <sjcodan> It really feels like she has different AI sometimes
[7:57:36] <cavefishes> practice and sleep on it
[7:57:39] <%watts121> @VivalaDragoon Umm...I think you got that backwards lol
[7:57:39] <Finchit> the dodges on this boss are the most specific in any souls game ever
[7:57:42] <%Felhad> Is this Malenia, blade of Miquella?
[7:57:45] <+Nomenanza> either lot of practice till you dodge everything or you get good rng and delete her before anything bad happens
[7:57:45] <Paperware> I believe there's a flask that reduces damage per consecutive hits
[7:57:46] <Finchit> precise i mean
[7:57:49] <%greasypete00> this is definitely the devs telling you that "blocking engenders passivity"
[7:57:50] <oda_flobunaga> All of tomorrow's stream: THIS
[7:57:51] <+Rigid_Digidi> rip
[7:57:54] <%watts121> @VivalaDragoon Peach is kicking his ass.,
[7:57:56] <$OfficerMods> SCOOPS
[7:57:57] <Archer336> Ouch
[7:57:58] <%X2Eliah> ripperooni
[7:57:59] <peachy996> grabbed
[7:58:00] <%DashXero> A little early for that, isn't it?
[7:58:01] <%SilvaChariot0133> Casual 85% HP nbd Kappa
[7:58:01] <$realm_forge> Calm down everyone Pat is used to getting his ass beat by a hot redhead
[7:58:03] <bassoontyphoon> It’s weird how her boss theme is just an orchestral version of “sweet home Alabama “
[7:58:04] <RickyRelucent> what, getting shafted?
[7:58:04] <%EldritchBee> I think he put on the guardbreak talisman, which is useless
[7:58:05] <2deep5u> penetrated
[7:58:06] <RubberFistFight> @Call_Me_Deacon_Blues no joke it would probably make this fight 10x harder because of the increase in health plus the heals
[7:58:07] <no123450n> stabbed in the breakfast
[7:58:08] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> one weakness of mimics is they can get command grabbed by that
[7:58:08] <%luftraumm1> I  don't understand why ppl say this is the worst boss in fromsoft?
[7:58:09] <%DashXero> Just command grab out of the blue?!
[7:58:09] <sothatsprettybrutal> i feel like that should just be an instakill on general principle
[7:58:11] <thesaverofhumens> if you kneel in front of her when you enter the boss room she steps on your face and lets you live
[7:58:12] <RickyRelucent> you'd think otherwise
[7:58:17] <RickyRelucent> but no
[7:58:17] <Ethel9727> This is Paige if she had a slightly less debilitating disease
[7:58:19] <sjcodan> SPOUSAL ABUSE: THE STREAM
[7:58:23] <+anoldtoilet> @EldritchBee he put on the jump attack talisman
[7:58:24] <sappinmahbinyot> that CG heals her for like 20% LUL
[7:58:25] <Profmcstevie> Good thing we specced into so much health so she can command grab 70% of it
[7:58:27] <+anoldtoilet> rofl
[7:58:27] <%MartinOfLoxley> She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella
[7:58:30] <%vexion_smh> She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella
[7:58:30] <Sigma_190_Beta> She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella.\
[7:58:32] <reonome> LUL
[7:58:33] <mrtanaka111> she is mileena
[7:58:34] <Sigma_190_Beta> Miquella of Blade, Malenia is She.
[7:58:34] <@QueequegTheater> She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella
[7:58:34] <RubberFistFight> WHAT';S HER NAME CHAT
[7:58:37] <%fanciful_fright> She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella
[7:58:38] <sjcodan> IS SCARLET ROT JUST LUPUS?
[7:58:38] <%MrMegaJackpots> She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella
[7:58:38] <%Valdorick> Paige is going to come in here and one shot her
[7:58:39] <$OfficerMods> There's alot of stuff in this game that seems like it should be instant kill but its not
[7:58:40] <Vermillion129> She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella
[7:58:41] <penitentpendant> @luftraumm1 Lifesteal is hated in boss design
[7:58:41] <ReverendGodshyne> I'm starting to think that she's Malenia, Blade of Miquella
[7:58:44] <cavefishes> maybe 3 honestly with the dual wield stagger
[7:58:44] <$OfficerMods> did you know you can tank the chariots?
[7:58:45] <+blitz31295> Paige with scarlet rot
[7:58:45] <+anoldtoilet> she has auto immune disease this boss really is paige
[7:58:48] <RickyRelucent> She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella
[7:58:48] <@DakotaMacDoodle> She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella.
[7:58:48] <+Nomenanza> I personally always had trouble dodging those 3 quick slashes
[7:58:51] <T_Sasquatch> @luftraumm1 she has the most bullshit combination of attacks I've ever seen PLUS lifesteal
[7:58:51] <TheProtomanBlues> Hows Pat fearing against Melina
[7:58:52] <+AyupaPupa> hesitation is defeat
[7:58:54] <D4N5T3P> AYAYA
[7:58:56] <+Drigoooooo> simp
[7:58:56] <SinisterBroccoli> I always blocked that move witha greatshield
[7:58:57] <mrtanaka111> thats a form of griefing
[7:58:58] <TwistParabola> She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella.
[7:58:58] <%shootbang_exe> she says it just like the health bar too
[7:58:59] <%watts121> Hesitation is Defeat yo.
[7:58:59] <tolloponik> 8 years
[7:58:59] <+Rofiarf> is that sarcasm?
[7:59:02] <Ghufufin> its make it memorable
[7:59:03] <NewWillinium> You ever get so rotted with disease that you become a Super Hero? That's what happened with Malenia. Also incest powers
[7:59:04] <RickyRelucent> I like her fit
[7:59:04] <cavefishes> just so you KNOW
[7:59:05] <+anoldtoilet> is cool she does lorettas move
[7:59:07] <%SilvaChariot0133> You WILL know her name
[7:59:08] <thesaverofhumens> she watched too much anime
[7:59:08] <Astral_Seraph> bunnnAYAYA
[7:59:10] <+anoldtoilet> or loretta does her move i guess
[7:59:11] <%Fenrisulfr_V> I'm still so mad about this fight. We killed each other on my, like, fourth attempt. Her death speech was so long that it didn't count for me, so I had to spend another several hours fighting her.
[7:59:15] <mrtanaka111> shes verbally teabaging pat
[7:59:15] <%luftraumm1> @penitentpendant but it is a mechanic available to the player too?
[7:59:16] <@QueequegTheater> @penitentpendant Well they should get good
[7:59:21] <RickyRelucent> its armored, but only in the good spots
[7:59:22] <AmusingMantis> Scarlet Rot is super mega CancAIDS
[7:59:23] <%fanciful_fright> They even have the height difference of Pat and Paige
[7:59:23] <+anoldtoilet> lmao fenrir
[7:59:25] <%dcentii> I am melania, you were just a pup
[7:59:25] <thesaverofhumens> pat is doing much better though in general
[7:59:26] <+anoldtoilet> fenris
[7:59:30] <Vermillion129> did you really win that LUL
[7:59:33] <%MartinOfLoxley> Dude, if you get her as a summon that would be broken.
[7:59:34] <%cade_calrayn> @PatStaresAt Paige needs to start introducing herself as "Paige, Blade of Elmo"
[7:59:35] <mrtanaka111> malenia
[7:59:36] <@QueequegTheater> Did you win that one too
[7:59:37] <Gimplock> Iam not on that boss yet but goddamn i want to fight her now, but iam not going to rush this game
[7:59:39] <Sigma_190_Beta> She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella.
[7:59:42] <Sigma_190_Beta> Miquella of Blade, Malenia is She.
[7:59:42] <D4N5T3P> @anoldtoilet wait what move exactly?
[7:59:42] <reonome> are you getting worse LUL
[7:59:44] <%fanciful_fright> She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella
[7:59:44] <AtisutoCurry> She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella.
[7:59:45] <%Call_Me_Deacon_Blues> Pat, might I recommend bleed
[7:59:45] <ErikFeral> I think she's saying her name over and over to maintain her sense of self. To avoid forgetting.
[7:59:48] <@QueequegTheater> She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella
[7:59:51] <bassoontyphoon> You got some good hits in though
[7:59:55] <SirItGoBoomAlot> needs some one winged angel in the background
[7:59:55] <MooCartoons> LOOKS LIKE A WIN TO ME
[7:59:55] <sothatsprettybrutal> one of those pyhrric victories
[7:59:57] <%watts121> man imagine how freaking loud this fight would be in Sekiro, so many damn sword clashes.
[8:00:02] <%cade_calrayn> that's exactly what she's doing, yeah
[8:00:03] <AmusingMantis> Oh no no, you missed that one, try another LUL
[8:00:03] <%dcentii> any damage trade in this fight you very specifically do not win
[8:00:04] <+Rofiarf> Malenia, Blade of Miquella
[8:00:04] <mrtanaka111> sureee vaati
[8:00:04] <D4N5T3P> LUL
[8:00:05] <%greasypete00> scarlet rotmentia
[8:00:06] <%MrMegaJackpots> She is Blade, Malenia of Miquella
[8:00:08] <%SilvaChariot0133> Memories Broken?
[8:00:08] <%cade_calrayn> yeah she's losing her mind here
[8:00:08] <tolloponik> you think she's saying that to keep herself sane
[8:00:09] <Vermillion129> wao she's just like Paige
[8:00:09] <Shockmaster182> Hey pat you died
[8:00:10] <sjcodan> SHE REALLY IS PAIGE
[8:00:13] <%CopperTucker> Paige, blade of Blindness
[8:00:14] <%Valdorick> @MartinOfLoxley You don't get her as a summon... you get her moveset, as her boss weapon.
[8:00:15] <tolloponik> I was just typing that
[8:00:16] <%luftraumm1> good ass headcannon
[8:00:18] <GrenYena> Scarlet Rot dementia probably tbh
[8:00:18] <RickyRelucent> like a can rolling down a flight of stairs
[8:00:21] <valstriam> Malenia is just sundowning as well
[8:00:23] <ArgentUndaCova> Oh no, her dementia's kicking in doodSad
[8:00:23] <+anoldtoilet> @anoldtoilet that rising slash is a weapon art you get from ghost form loretta
[8:00:23] <Finchit> i thought it was a warrior thing. remember who beat you kinda shit
[8:00:25] <ErikFeral> maybe, if it's immortality induced
[8:00:27] <RickyRelucent> tink tonk tonk tink
[8:00:28] <$realm_forge> This is Paige’s vengeance for the Nidhogg stream
[8:00:31] <+anoldtoilet> called lorettas something
[8:00:32] <+Drigoooooo> whose going to tell her Miquella is not coming
[8:00:32] <MooCartoons> SHE MIGHT FORGOR
[8:00:35] <+anoldtoilet> maybe lorettas slash idk
[8:00:39] <doster504> oh just set it to night and come back she'll be drinking a bottle of tree sap and won't be able to fight
[8:00:39] <%cade_calrayn> she's absolutely losing herself in the fog of the rot, yeah
[8:00:40] <@QueequegTheater> I FORGOR
[8:00:42] <%Monkeyweed21> the unalloyed gold needle was made for her
[8:00:43] <+anoldtoilet> but its the same move malenia does, the rising launcher slash
[8:00:44] <NewWillinium> Is there a proper term for this kind of Winged Helm? Because it never doesn't look amazing.
[8:00:44] <%Valdorick> I mean, Scarlet Rot made Radahn eat corpses, so...
[8:00:47] <RubberFistFight> @Finchit Probably a little from column a, little from column b
[8:00:52] <T_Sasquatch> I am PeachSaliva, Bane of Pregnant Women
[8:00:56] <%shootbang_exe> god that life steal is so aggressive
[8:01:01] <RickyRelucent> YOU CAN DO IT
[8:01:08] <%cade_calrayn> @T_Sasquatch Blade of Elmo
[8:01:11] <armadaofghosts> Problem with that is, how long until she stops rememebering what those words mean?
[8:01:12] <+sashagreenspiderqueen> i love that this boss heals with a 20 hit combo that doesnt need to do damage to leech from you
[8:01:13] <%MartinOfLoxley> Man, I can't believe PeachSaliva is destrying Pat in PVP on stream!
[8:01:14] <%fanciful_fright> Also, you can see that she's blind in the intro cutscene of the fight
[8:01:16] <+sashagreenspiderqueen> thats really good design
[8:01:19] <sjcodan> You need to lower her HP before she'll do it
[8:01:20] <%watts121> So she kicked Godricks ass so bad that he had to kiss her feet right?
[8:01:22] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> its at 50% or so i think
[8:01:23] <+Rofiarf> she only does the move when threatened ;)
[8:01:25] <T_Sasquatch> @cade_calrayn LUL
[8:01:27] <%greasypete00> is she just jetstream sam? would it not be fitting to play "the only thing i know for real" over her fight
[8:01:27] <basedfresh> this fight is bloodborne your not being aggressive enough
[8:01:29] <%vexion_smh> She is Paige, Blade of Mustard Queen
[8:01:29] <Vermillion129> really need to dodge forward I think?
[8:01:30] <RickyRelucent> PowerUpL SwiftRage PowerUpR
[8:01:30] <sjcodan> She unlocks more moves the lower she gets
[8:01:30] <%boggsz12> she doesn't do the big one until you get her health lower
[8:01:31] <Sigma_190_Beta> She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella.
[8:01:32] <Finchit> pat has dodged the triple slash wrong every time. its hilarious
[8:01:32] <AmusingMantis> Oh no no, you missed that one, try another LUL
[8:01:34] <Sigma_190_Beta> Miquella of Blade, Malenia is She.
[8:01:36] <%MartinOfLoxley> She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella
[8:01:37] <%Felhad> PeachSaliva, Blade of Skeletons
[8:01:38] <thesaverofhumens> she only does that move under 60% hp
[8:01:38] <TwistParabola> She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella.
[8:01:38] <cavefishes> she'll only do it below 70% hp
[8:01:43] <%fanciful_fright> She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella
[8:01:48] <rudiciuscaesar> who is she again?
[8:01:48] <RickyRelucent> PowerUpL SwiftRage PowerUpR PowerUpL SwiftRage PowerUpR
[8:01:48] <@QueequegTheater> She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella
[8:01:52] <%EldritchBee> @AmusingMantis You missed that one! Try another!
[8:01:57] <+Rofiarf> Malenia, Blade of Miquella
[8:01:58] <oda_flobunaga> This ficht would suck if it wasn't so FUCKING COOL
[8:02:00] <%JustToWatch> can't wait for the mods that replace every enemy in the game with her
[8:02:02] <Vermillion129> what is malenia big move called again?
[8:02:06] <+Kinggarbage> Shoulda made her say something different after try 100
[8:02:07] <%livi242> she is Paige, Blade of Mustard
[8:02:08] <mrtanaka111> try parry
[8:02:11] <@DakotaMacDoodle> Its a hard fight but i really enjoyed it.
[8:02:14] <%EldritchBee> @Vermillion129 Waterfowl Dance
[8:02:15] <RickyRelucent> tree sentinel is gonna have to be my first armor
[8:02:17] <ALazo> what's her name again?
[8:02:19] <%dcentii> yeah you can be hyper aggressive in this fight if you can start reading the startups
[8:02:23] <%MartinOfLoxley> @livi242 Perfection
[8:02:24] <MooCartoons> pry tarry
[8:02:30] <RickyRelucent> its bronze, it has a tree
[8:02:33] <RickyRelucent> spartan mohawk
[8:02:36] <%jamsbybetty> @mrtanaka111 you have to hit 3 parries to get a riposte it's pretty rough
[8:02:37] <NewWillinium> So if one were to change her fight even a little, how would y'all do it? I think that I would just make the healing effect a *bit* less aggressive and or adding more room to dodge in the Waterfowl dance
[8:02:38] <Khester824> Using bloodhound step made this really easy
[8:02:40] <Vermillion129> danke
[8:02:44] <%EldritchBee> Pat she's strong against Holy, weak to fire
[8:02:46] <%VivalaDragoon> I love that she has the anime extra slice, it’s so good
[8:02:49] <OverlordedK> I only beat her because I went in hard cause she staggers easily and you can corner trap her a bit
[8:02:55] <Finchit> her move is called the duck dance?>
[8:03:00] <RubberFistFight> @NewWillinium reduce her healtha bit, tone down the heal
[8:03:00] <+condemned_15> Bearer of the Malenia, Blade, Blade, Miquella
[8:03:01] <AtisutoCurry> I wonder how peach will fare against this fight
[8:03:02] <%MartinOfLoxley> Who can I commission to draw Peach as Malenia?
[8:03:04] <%tetraes> check you storage box?
[8:03:05] <$OfficerMods> its on another sword
[8:03:05] <thesaverofhumens> to defeat the cyberwoman, hit it until it dies
[8:03:07] <coziestbank> hoarfrost is STRONK
[8:03:07] <RubberFistFight> reduce the damage output of the flurry
[8:03:08] <%fanciful_fright> ITs a greatsword pat, no blood slash
[8:03:09] <RickyRelucent> did u ever pick up the seppuku katana?
[8:03:09] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @NewWillinium I'd probably halve her healing and reduce the damage she does by 20%.
[8:03:09] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> maybe wrong type?
[8:03:11] <@QueequegTheater> @Finchit shuba shuba
[8:03:12] <%dcentii> has to be a smaller sword
[8:03:12] <OverlordedK> makes bleed procs real good
[8:03:13] <+cawi> does blood slash work on greatswords?
[8:03:15] <+Tredecian> might not be available fro greats word
[8:03:15] <+LandOfTheWay> "I am Paige, Blade of Elmo. And I have never known what Baba is."
[8:03:17] <mrtanaka111> wtf is occult
[8:03:20] <%DEETRz> i didnt find her too bad to be honest, but i was heavy, holy, and had a halberd so she went down pretty easy
[8:03:21] <digaogrunge> Smaller swords
[8:03:24] <%greasypete00> i put blood slash on claymore
[8:03:27] <RickyRelucent> occult is unholy
[8:03:28] <turtlebits64> maybe give her less health if shes just gonna heal everything. it makes shields pretty useless against her
[8:03:31] <Sigma_190_Beta> @PatStaresAt Check the other weapons in your box as well.
[8:03:32] <RickyRelucent> kinda like dark
[8:03:32] <sjcodan> I mean, I put bloodslash on my great Epee
[8:03:35] <RickyRelucent> but holy
[8:03:36] <+anoldtoilet> occult used to be god killing weaponry
[8:03:38] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @mrtanaka111 Occult is high Arcane scaling.
[8:03:40] <%sporeian94> how long has pat been at this boss so far?
[8:03:41] <+anoldtoilet> in dark souls
[8:03:45] <%Felhad> @mrtanaka111 Makes undead unable to revive
[8:03:49] <oda_flobunaga> She's Persica, Blade of the Salvia
[8:03:50] <RickyRelucent> oh its arcane here?
[8:03:51] <%dcentii> blood is arcane and cold is int, both can cheese her with mimic but both would need respec
[8:03:53] <+anoldtoilet> aaahhh arcane
[8:03:53] <RickyRelucent> weird
[8:03:55] <Vermillion129> @sporeian94 35 mins
[8:03:57] <RickyRelucent> makes sense
[8:03:57] <%X2Eliah> @sporeian94 than an hour
[8:04:00] <RickyRelucent> but kinda weird
[8:04:03] <CashZen> Bleed + Frost weapon is best combo
[8:04:07] <%tetraes> did u box it?
[8:04:11] <Sigma_190_Beta> @PatStaresAt It's on a weapon in your box.
[8:04:14] <%EldritchBee> is it on another weapon?
[8:04:15] <%X2Eliah> @PatStaresAt Seriously respecc into int moonveil build
[8:04:15] <NewWillinium> I'm surprised you haven't upgraded any of your weapons to +25 or +10 yet
[8:04:20] <mrtanaka111> do it with cestus coward
[8:04:22] <%deadguydied> on a different weapon?
[8:04:25] <%strakillias> +25 that claymore
[8:04:34] <Sigma_190_Beta> Maybe not then.
[8:04:37] <%tetraes> Uchi works
[8:04:38] <RickyRelucent> any blood items?
[8:04:41] <RickyRelucent> resin
[8:04:41] <+swesterly> @X2Eliah lmaooooo
[8:04:44] <RubberFistFight> god i love how she just fucking stalks you slowly and paces if you don't initiate the fight
[8:04:46] <%Felhad> @x2eliah a cowardly suggestion
[8:04:47] <+blitz31295> katana time
[8:04:48] <%greasypete00> i can put bloody slash on my claymore thats really weird
[8:04:49] <Sunstalker> Flamberge with blood slash and frost affinty pretty good
[8:04:55] <Ghufufin> lightsaber?
[8:04:55] <%EldritchBee> She's resistant to Holy, Pat
[8:04:56] <Lulu19> coded
[8:04:56] <$realm_forge> Does she steal health from summons too?
[8:05:00] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt its on a weapon in your box, blood blade is the reduvia move
[8:05:01] <+Rofiarf> i unno
[8:05:02] <%X2Eliah> none of them take ashes
[8:05:04] <SinisterBroccoli> resists holy
[8:05:06] <%Fenrisulfr_V> Is your Bloody Slash already on something?
[8:05:06] <Sigma_190_Beta> Both deal holy, so she'll resist it.
[8:05:07] <digaogrunge> Has to be a normal weapon
[8:05:07] <RickyRelucent> back on forth a bit
[8:05:08] <oda_flobunaga> Coded can't be messed with
[8:05:08] <%fanciful_fright> Can't ash either
[8:05:09] <doster504> you can't put bloodslash on either of those
[8:05:09] <+anoldtoilet> dont even tell him any more lol
[8:05:09] <Lulu19> cause the ashe but she's strong against holy
[8:05:12] <coziestbank> It'd be kinda crazy if you could burn her up with madness
[8:05:12] <%Willowight> i thought holy was bad
[8:05:12] <+Smokebanshee> @realm_forge yep
[8:05:13] <sjcodan> STOP DOING HOLY DAMAGE, PAT
[8:05:15] <%luftraumm1> coded is just holy no?
[8:05:16] <1_Dusk> the epitaph has more AR
[8:05:16] <basedfresh> for anime slash you just have to unlock and Sprint away
[8:05:18] <+Nomenanza> @realm_forge anything she hits gives her HP back
[8:05:22] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> bloodhound step, stomp, bloodslash, and spinning slash are good choices for wep arts
[8:05:26] <+swesterly> has to be a normal weapon
[8:05:26] <SinisterBroccoli> go fire
[8:05:27] <+anoldtoilet> pat try whatever you want, equip the holy only fist weapon
[8:05:30] <$realm_forge> That’s messed up
[8:05:32] <Sigma_190_Beta> @PatStaresAt Also, those are unique weapons.
[8:05:33] <SinisterBroccoli> or ice
[8:05:34] <%strakillias> Fight this bitch with a red lightsaber
[8:05:34] <%DashXero> Man... Pat really seems to like holy damage...
[8:05:37] <Sigma_190_Beta> Can't Ash them up.
[8:05:38] <%bruuzer12> She's strong to holy Pat
[8:05:39] <%jamsbybetty> I heard the jellyfish doesn't give her health back when she hits it
[8:05:41] <%Valdorick> It fucking BLOWS the only way to get fucking faith scaling on a weapon is via holy damage
[8:05:41] <+anoldtoilet> fire is her main weakness yes, you beat scarlet rot with fire
[8:05:42] <%dcentii> holy damage big poopoo vs ginger   orphan of maria
[8:05:43] <%Felhad> @patstaresat try Hoarfrost Stomp
[8:05:44] <RickyRelucent> so...mlgs is confirmed
[8:05:45] <%JustToWatch> Dragon Fist her
[8:05:45] <RickyRelucent> btw
[8:05:46] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt TRY Black Blade KNife
[8:05:46] <%tetraes> Oh yeah the art ur looking for is on a weapon in ur box lol
[8:05:48] <OverlordedK> her being resistance to holy sure explains why I had so much trouble, I was using the winged scythe lol
[8:05:50] <RickyRelucent> for anybody not aware
[8:05:51] <+lord_sykos> Yeah I had to do a complete respec for this one
[8:05:51] <+anoldtoilet> just like you can cheese radahn with rot
[8:05:52] <NewWillinium> . . Do the Cipher weapons get S scaling on Faith? I don't think I've seen a single scaling higher then a B
[8:05:54] <+swesterly> does he have the dark whetblade?
[8:05:57] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> You are doing fine with rykard sword, you just need to learn her moves
[8:05:57] <doster504> this fight is why I respecced to katana cheese just so I could get through it
[8:05:57] <%greasypete00> is blood slash on a weapon thats in your chest
[8:05:58] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @PatStaresAt Just buff one of your weapons with Bloodflame Blade.
[8:06:02] <Lulu19> what about rahadns swords?
[8:06:04] <Sigma_190_Beta> @RickyRelucent He did the quest for it.
[8:06:09] <Sunstalker> @Valdorick No i isn't? Flame Art is fire that scales of faith
[8:06:14] <$OfficerMods> pat please just sell runes
[8:06:15] <%luftraumm1> radahns are int
[8:06:19] <RickyRelucent> @Sigma_190_Beta : o i missed out
[8:06:31] <+ZephynM> Wow, Pat's stats tell me I have been doing EVERYTHING wrong with my build.
[8:06:41] <neoscremlass> move here is to clearly to +10 rykard and black gargoyle
[8:06:43] <+blitz31295> @doster504 same
[8:06:45] <mrtanaka111> or pat has
[8:06:46] <%Valdorick> @Valdorick OH RIGHT! I always forget about Flame Art... because it isn't in the holy/lightning class.
[8:06:56] <+anoldtoilet> pats build looks insane but whatever works
[8:07:00] <%dcentii> pats build is weird I wouldn't take much from his stats
[8:07:08] <mrtanaka111> git gud
[8:07:14] <RickyRelucent> @ZephynM ehh, not rly
[8:07:16] <Shockmaster182> Pat what’s scarier, death or aging?
[8:07:16] <sjcodan> Zeph, you say that like pat knows what he's doing
[8:07:18] <thesaverofhumens> skill matters
[8:07:18] <mrtanaka111> i mnaxed arcane and won the game with 10 vigor
[8:07:19] <%DashXero> Why is that?
[8:07:22] <RickyRelucent> low? np, over 60? still np
[8:07:23] <@QueequegTheater> You need more vig
[8:07:28] <RickyRelucent> beyond 80? maybe?
[8:07:33] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> she's 2 hits regardless of your stats
[8:07:36] <Khester824> Just use the bloodborne doge
[8:07:37] <sjcodan> You need 60 Vog
[8:07:39] <+tnomads> what is the thesis of pat's build
[8:07:45] <+KingKrampus> pat, good Heaven, it is 1am, how long have you been streaming
[8:07:49] <+anoldtoilet> you dont need that much vigor jesus
[8:07:49] <Lulu19> hoarforst stomp is hella op and the ice axe has it. Uchi with bloodblade.... prob the best bets. str, faith bros got fucked.
[8:07:50] <Finchit> pat is the excellence of execution, he's gonna destroy her after he changes his build a bit
[8:07:52] <+ZephynM> @sjcodan Well, he is further along than I am and I'm so bad at the game. I can't barely fight in those dang mountains.
[8:07:54] <%fanciful_fright> Isn't Vig vastly diminished returns after 40?
[8:07:55] <Sigma_190_Beta> @tnomads Grind of Stream.
[8:07:56] <Finchit> not copium 100%
[8:07:57] <RickyRelucent> @sjcodan poggies
[8:08:00] <@QueequegTheater> @KingKrampus !uptime
[8:08:01] <@Moobot> @KingKrampus I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 8h 8m.
[8:08:03] <%dcentii> arcane/int is prob the best stats for her just cause of the frost/blood procs
[8:08:06] <Sigma_190_Beta> @tnomads Grind Off Stream to be big.
[8:08:15] <RickyRelucent> did pat get the trinket for runes?
[8:08:16] <RickyRelucent> c :
[8:08:19] <+ZephynM> I could probably start by not using a +18 Lordsword Straight sword too.
[8:08:23] <rudiciuscaesar> I like this sword dipped in peanut butter...
[8:08:23] <RickyRelucent> like silver serpent
[8:08:30] <thesaverofhumens> milkeena is weak to being hit in the face really hard
[8:08:31] <mrtanaka111> imagine this fight with a heavy weapon
[8:08:31] <%dcentii> naww vigor goes well into like 60
[8:08:33] <NewWillinium> This is the first time I've seen a weapon scale higher then a B
[8:08:37] <mike2hands> Did he do it? He beat her?
[8:08:40] <%X2Eliah> Sooo I'm guessing that Uchigatana with hoarfrost stom would do well here
[8:08:41] <@QueequegTheater> Oh so close
[8:08:43] <+anoldtoilet> vigor doesnt go over 20
[8:08:46] <it_came_from_outer_space> youre only missing rune
[8:08:47] <sjcodan> Vigor softcaps at 60
[8:08:51] <%fanciful_fright> Talk to Gideon?
[8:08:51] <it_came_from_outer_space> i think
[8:08:52] <%Valdorick> I forget, how close is Pat to the last Smithing Stone bell?
[8:08:53] <Ethel9727> Ran out of souls not upgrade materiaals
[8:09:00] <digaogrunge> You just need runes
[8:09:02] <mrtanaka111> vigor max at 80
[8:09:06] <+KingKrampus> no no, Mods, that was rhethorical, I'm concerned that pat is streaming still this late
[8:09:14] <+kaztinka> yes lol
[8:09:18] <+KingKrampus> ORB man must protect his health
[8:09:29] <+AyupaPupa> i'm concerned that you're playin elden ring
[8:09:29] <+ZephynM> Btw, does armor really matter in this game besides resistances? I feel like my best heavy armor still gets me killed as fast as my default vagabond armor most of the time.
[8:09:38] <%dcentii> and the damage stats go to 80 its kinda crazy, like I had arcane/int at 80 on different runs and that stuff is busted
[8:09:43] <@QueequegTheater> @ZephynM A little
[8:09:43] <Vermillion129> I have never seen pat stream this long, it's great
[8:09:50] <+Nomenanza> poise does matter bit more than it used to
[8:09:54] <sjcodan> Armor is KINDA useless but not entirely
[8:09:55] <NewWillinium> Huh. Want me to look up where you get that last one?
[8:09:55] <%fanciful_fright> @ZephynM Armor is mostly about poise.
[8:10:01] <doster504> @ZephynM not really
[8:10:08] <+tnomads> @zephynm you can turn 800 damage into 775 damage
[8:10:10] <boostergoldz> well pat changed armor and it allowed him to live through malenia's anime move so yes.
[8:10:17] <RubberFistFight> @Vermillion129 he did a 10 hour for sekiro and a 10 hour for hollow knight
[8:10:21] <Vermillion129> @ZephynM at best you get like 5-10% more damage reduction
[8:10:33] <+anoldtoilet> @ZephynM uh no
[8:10:36] <+RedMaskBandit> the Mountain top of the Giants reminds me of that lost archstone from Demon Soul's.
[8:10:38] <mrtanaka111> wtf is a haligtree
[8:10:41] <+KingKrampus> good Lord, there's STILL map Pat hasn't unlocked yet?! how big is this game
[8:10:43] <xDartuzax> If only there was an easy place to farm runes…
[8:10:44] <doster504> someone said you can havel this where the fuck are they now
[8:10:47] <+ZephynM> So I could probably look for another Larval tear and swap out my 30 some-odd Endurance for some Faith so I can use my fancy Gargoyle swords. Since I don't use most of that stamina anyway.
[8:10:49] <+anoldtoilet> the number it says your damage reduction stat is, is the percentage of damage that you get reduced by
[8:10:57] <+anoldtoilet> if you say 60 dr, your damage is reduced by 60 percent.
[8:10:59] <$OfficerMods> if you wear the heaviest armor and drink damage reduction phisik AND have damage reduction talismans AND cast damage reduction incatations its pretty good
[8:10:59] <+anoldtoilet> armor is strong.
[8:11:00] <+swesterly> @RedMaskBandit love thinking of it like this
[8:11:02] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt You get the 4th smithing stone bell bearing from an MSQ boss
[8:11:02] <oda_flobunaga> A Haligtree is a Blessed Tree
[8:11:17] <it_came_from_outer_space> @doster504 I have heard anecdotally you can havel it
[8:11:20] <Lulu19> spam stomp lol
[8:11:21] <Vermillion129> @QueequegTheater kek MSQ boss LUL
[8:11:23] <mrtanaka111> no wonder she killed raddan
[8:11:23] <Sigma_190_Beta> She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella.
[8:11:24] <@QueequegTheater> She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella
[8:11:25] <%dcentii> the pearldrake+2 and dragoncrest greatshield talismans you get from the haligtree are also super duper busted
[8:11:26] <%fanciful_fright> Wait, does Pat not have Bloodflame Blade? Or does it need INT?
[8:11:28] <%MartinOfLoxley> She is Miquella, Blade of Malenia
[8:11:30] <TwistParabola> She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella.
[8:11:30] <+anoldtoilet> you have to also worry about weaknesses and stuff that penetrates various defenses because not much armor defends vs all types well
[8:11:36] <djblue_shift> does this track remind anyone of hollow knight?
[8:11:36] <doster504> @it_came_from_outer_space you can eat one more hit if you're lucky
[8:11:37] <%luftraumm1> just gotta execute
[8:11:39] <%fanciful_fright> She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella
[8:11:39] <+sashagreenspiderqueen> you should also be eating a fuckload of prawns, theyre like 600 souls and give you defense boosts
[8:11:46] <$OfficerMods> Also damage reduction helps if you are using barricade shield
[8:11:46] <Mitchellsocks> Hoarfrost + staggering weapon SHOULd make your Mimic good
[8:11:53] <@DakotaMacDoodle> She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella.
[8:11:54] <%discoinfierno> I literally could not have arrived at a better time. Was hoping I could catch this moment all day
[8:12:01] <+ZephynM> @anoldtoilet Okay that makes sense then, thank you.
[8:12:02] <+anoldtoilet> but no, armor is not "weak", or "caps out at 10 percent", its literally the percentage you see in the equip menu is the percentage your damage is reduced by
[8:12:08] <+swesterly> oh no the stomp
[8:12:09] <RubberFistFight> conventional wisdom here suggests a stacking debuff that'll erase a chunk of her health when it procs, like frost or bleed, since the small hits are likely to be undone when she tags you.
[8:12:10] <%justcallmebobplease> GO FROST GO
[8:12:11] <%brungoboy> How many attempts is he on?
[8:12:12] <Vermillion129> hoarfrost stomp rocks
[8:12:13] <sothatsprettybrutal> oh my that damage
[8:12:17] <$OfficerMods> meme stomp
[8:12:17] <%MartinOfLoxley> Bring back your old friend, the Mimic!
[8:12:17] <RubberFistFight> that's what most people seem to be doing
[8:12:19] <sjcodan> WHORESTOMP
[8:12:24] <+sashagreenspiderqueen> prawns are like an extra 10-15% mitigation which has helped me a lot
[8:12:24] <RickyRelucent> that was the grab
[8:12:26] <RubberFistFight> i know it's what i'm doing, 2x blood uchis
[8:12:28] <RickyRelucent> AGAIN?
[8:12:28] <$OfficerMods> SCOOPS
[8:12:28] <penitentpendant> Command GRAB
[8:12:29] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt Try putting on Both Soreseal talismans
[8:12:29] <Sigma_190_Beta> She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella.
[8:12:32] <RubberFistFight> it stacks bleed very fast
[8:12:34] <TwistParabola> She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella.
[8:12:34] <@QueequegTheater> She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella
[8:12:34] <%MartinOfLoxley> She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella
[8:12:34] <Lulu19> stomp def getting nerfed
[8:12:34] <RickyRelucent> spamming B!TCH
[8:12:37] <+swesterly> the fucking meme stomp
[8:12:38] <%Felhad> She is Melony, Blade of Michael Jordan
[8:12:38] <rudiciuscaesar> This dame does insane damage....
[8:12:39] <sjcodan> DONT ACT LIKE YOU WONT GET COMMAND GRABBED
[8:12:41] <bassoontyphoon> A song of fire and ice realness
[8:12:43] <@DakotaMacDoodle> She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella.?
[8:12:44] <@QueequegTheater> @Lulu19 lmao no
[8:12:44] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> doesnt work i think
[8:12:45] <%dcentii> pat could probably get the icerind hatchet up to +10 and do way more damage with the stomp
[8:12:45] <+sashagreenspiderqueen> she is malenia blade of miquella
[8:12:46] <%vexion_smh> She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella
[8:12:48] <mrtanaka111> learn2parry
[8:12:48] <+Rigid_Digidi> It would actually hurt
[8:12:50] <$OfficerMods> you can't put on both
[8:12:50] <Vermillion129> he gonna die in one shot with both soreseal LUL
[8:12:50] <oda_flobunaga> Its like an extra 40 levels
[8:12:51] <$realm_forge> Pat is off of the dance
[8:12:51] <%fanciful_fright> She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella
[8:12:52] <legend_of_nolan> gotta jump when she grabs for a easy punish
[8:12:54] <coziestbank> Do you have the Crystallin summon. She is using one handed slash attacks.
[8:12:56] <%Felhad> @patstaresat got any prawns or crabs?
[8:12:57] <Sunstalker> What? those would be worse at the stat levels he's a
[8:12:59] <sjcodan> MIMIC WITH THE WHORESTOMP
[8:13:00] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> @anoldtoilet Any armor that lowers the style meter is weak to me
[8:13:01] <%nip_nips> who is she?
[8:13:01] <GamesNoir> is this the last boss
[8:13:06] <thesaverofhumens> you can do it maybe possibly I might believe in you
[8:13:07] <%Cozy90> maybe try light equip load for more i frames on rolls?
[8:13:10] <Lulu19> no
[8:13:12] <%luftraumm1> mimic with only blood fire would be good now
[8:13:12] <MoustacheCEO> She is Melany blade of Mackayla
[8:13:13] <+swesterly> @mrtanaka111 yeah it only takes three parries to riposte
[8:13:13] <+Rigid_Digidi> Good damage
[8:13:18] <+ZephynM> Wow she hurts
[8:13:19] <%Felhad> @gamesnoir hardest, not final
[8:13:20] <thesaverofhumens> @GamesNoir optional ultra boss
[8:13:20] <Vermillion129> @GamesNoir no she's an optional boss
[8:13:23] <oda_flobunaga> @OfficerMods yes you can.  I know you can because I am currently running with both

[8:13:56] <Lulu19> 13 more hours lets gooo
[8:13:57] <%X2Eliah> @mrtanaka111 woolie will never find this
[8:13:57] <doster504> damn 21 hour stream bois
[8:13:59] <BlueSpartan119> ok good
[8:14:01] <sjcodan> NO TAKESIES BACKSIES
[8:14:03] <%discoinfierno> @D4N5T3P mhm
[8:14:06] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Summon Mimic and bully her with stomp
[8:14:07] <LittleBigQuebec> hey pat and the gang i'm going in vacation in like 2h
[8:14:08] <+anoldtoilet> their kind hates ice and fire both.
[8:14:09] <LittleBigQuebec> get her
[8:14:12] <Khester824> She fights using the bloodborne system you gotta do the same
[8:14:12] <RickyRelucent> almost had her one try, no?
[8:14:12] <%The_0_2_Hero> Definitely recommend throwing Bloodhound Step on whatever weapon you use, it makes dodging and closing in on this so much easier
[8:14:14] <+anoldtoilet> woolie will find this in 2023
[8:14:14] <+blitz31295> holy shit hoarfrost is busted
[8:14:19] <RickyRelucent> like literal magic pixel
[8:14:21] <+OneTrueAsshat> Toughest boss From has ever made
[8:14:22] <rudiciuscaesar> man, imagine if Pat got up at like 6am and did a 6am stream, I bet that would....alter the tone.
[8:14:24] <TheSandmanIsHere> 2 pm sounds realistic for time to beat her
[8:14:27] <sjcodan> @anoldtoilet LUL
[8:14:28] <Finchit> do it off stream and have a weird recap session?
[8:14:34] <+RocketBarrel> Man, I cannot stay at a boss for an hour in SP games. My patience is so thin
[8:14:36] <%SilvaChariot0133> lytMOTIVATED
[8:14:38] <NewWillinium> Woolie is going to love and loathe this boss
[8:14:40] <Sigma_190_Beta> She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella.
[8:14:43] <+Rigid_Digidi> liked the jump
[8:14:45] <+LandOfTheWay> yes
[8:14:50] <%MartinOfLoxley> She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella
[8:14:50] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> or bloodhound step
[8:14:50] <%EldritchBee> Has Pat gone to the Fingers yet?
[8:14:51] <%fanciful_fright> She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella
[8:14:53] <%vexion_smh> NIGERUN DAYO
[8:14:53] <sjcodan> RUUUUUUN
[8:14:56] <Sunstalker> Can Mistraven even protect you from thios blender?
[8:14:58] <%dcentii> Run, dodge in, unlock dodge away I think was the pattern
[8:14:58] <rudiciuscaesar> like one time I got called in to work at 11am, and I'm a night crew worker, it was like I was replaced with an alligator, I couldn't have been more aggressive and lazy lol.
[8:15:00] <RickyRelucent> can u mount here?
[8:15:03] <@QueequegTheater> Either that, or 7 frame-perfect dodges
[8:15:04] <+anoldtoilet> @NewWillinium oh yeah this is his favorite boss lol. he hasnt seen her yet but i can tell
[8:15:07] <swordorwhip> She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella.
[8:15:07] <%MartinOfLoxley> Reggie is going to love the feet shots through this fight
[8:15:07] <+Rigid_Digidi> @I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I This carried me through the fight
[8:15:08] <oda_flobunaga> Regie is so going to be able to get Woolie back for cheering on Artorias
[8:15:11] <$OfficerMods> BARRICADE BOYS
[8:15:15] <+swesterly> you must sprint away the instant she goes up, keep sprinting until after the second volley, then roll towards her before she starts the third
[8:15:25] <+anoldtoilet> shes such a cool boss
[8:15:29] <+OneTrueAsshat> Given Woolies love for Maria he’s gonna be head over heels for Malenia
[8:15:30] <rudiciuscaesar> greatshield, no clothes?
[8:15:30] <+swesterly> spamming attacks will get you kill by attack queing when you should be sprinting
[8:15:31] <RickyRelucent> has to be out there
[8:15:34] <sjcodan> BARR I CADE! BARR I CADE!
[8:15:37] <RickyRelucent> no way theres no poison or flame enchant
[8:15:38] <+Smokebanshee> it exists
[8:15:39] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> frame perfect dodges arent enough
[8:15:42] <%dcentii> @PatStaresAt barricade on any shield does work but it does give back like 15-20% of her health
[8:15:43] <RubberFistFight> i will mention Pat that you did better when you had a summon. Yes, you were dealing with her healing, but when you and tiche did the wombo combo it took huge chunks off her
[8:15:45] <+anoldtoilet> isnt there a black flame blade from D
[8:15:47] <%EldritchBee> Woolie isn't gonna be able to do this guys, hes not even gonna find the area I bet
[8:15:48] <RickyRelucent> with swamps and volcanoes and crap
[8:15:49] <Finchit> i just wish woolie would stream on his own more often
[8:15:51] <+anoldtoilet> but thats holy i think
[8:15:52] <%X2Eliah> theres a poison enchant for sure
[8:15:53] <+gamemas10> too bad she doesn't get recycled
[8:15:54] <+anoldtoilet> rip
[8:15:57] <thesaverofhumens> @OneTrueAsshat only until he actually fights her
[8:15:58] <@QueequegTheater> @sjcodan She still heals off 100% blocks and 1-hand damage is too low
[8:15:59] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> @sjcodan She heals even on blocks
[8:15:59] <%fanciful_fright> There is a Poison enchant, dunno about flame enchant
[8:16:02] <Sunstalker> I guess thats hat teh weapon arts are for?
[8:16:03] <$OfficerMods> @dcentii depends entierly on your damage reduction
[8:16:04] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> No Moonlight Great Sword?
[8:16:05] <RubberFistFight> but since you're trying to learn her combos and shit it's fair to not use one.
[8:16:06] <RickyRelucent> Not sure how far you're into this
[8:16:07] <legend_of_nolan> elden footies
[8:16:09] <%dekkitout> "still no head..." tajC
[8:16:15] <RickyRelucent> so i can say if you might've missed em
[8:16:15] <+pkmamsters> Oh my god, holy shit. is that Malenia, Blade of Miquella?
[8:16:17] <RickyRelucent> can't*
[8:16:18] <oda_flobunaga> MLGS is in the game
[8:16:23] <%jamsbybetty> I wish I hadn't beaten her I wanna try out different tech to see what little weirdsies I can figure out about the fight
[8:16:31] <sjcodan> @sjcodan Barricade and parries are how you do the fight with no hits, though
[8:16:32] <+OneTrueAsshat> @thesaverofhumens good point lol
[8:16:39] <Sigma_190_Beta> She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella.
[8:16:42] <mrtanaka111> she malenia
[8:16:47] <%dcentii> she has never known de feet
[8:16:48] <TwistParabola> She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella.
[8:16:51] <swordorwhip> She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella.
[8:16:52] <@DakotaMacDoodle> She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella.
[8:16:53] <Soulsbjorne> whats this bosses name again?
[8:16:56] <+Rigid_Digidi> I am chlamydia
[8:16:56] <coziestbank> BTW ice weapon arts DO NOT care about your INT
[8:16:58] <+blitz31295> i want them to release a DLC called "fuck you" where you fight 2 malenias at once
[8:16:59] <%VivalaDragoon> Who is this lady?
[8:17:04] <%fanciful_fright> Doing well enough that you can prolly get her down with Tyche added in
[8:17:04] <oda_flobunaga> Actually, by the time Woolie gets to her she'll probably be fixed and tuned down
[8:17:05] <+ZephynM> Alrighty my super-duper-delicious burrito bowl is almost ready
[8:17:07] <Finchit> ironically she has been defeeted
[8:17:07] <LittleBigQuebec> MLGS is Int scalling so even if pat has/would have it there's not much it would do on pat's build
[8:17:09] <thesaverofhumens> LUL
[8:17:11] <%DashXero> Goin' stompin' in his airforce ones...
[8:17:17] <@QueequegTheater> I don't really get the whole "don't summon" thing, I kept summoning every single time.  You can't learn phase 2 without getting to it
[8:17:23] <thesaverofhumens> @Finchit by her own power
[8:17:23] <%dcentii> Should find out what her name is in about a minute or so
[8:17:24] <rudiciuscaesar> this is a Bloodborne speed boss in a game not meant for that speed
[8:17:28] <$OfficerMods> SCOOPS
[8:17:28] <mrtanaka111> now realize that the early draft for this arena was on a rot pool
[8:17:30] <%ZephynM> ZephynM subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 14 months! yay 13 months
[8:17:33] <swordorwhip> @Soulsbjorne She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella.
[8:17:34] <Vermillion129> There's bloodflame blade from scarab in liurnia near rose church iirc
[8:17:34] <+OneTrueAsshat> God I hope they don’t nerf her
[8:17:35] <Soulsbjorne> tech they tied
[8:17:35] <@QueequegTheater> She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella
[8:17:36] <%dcentii> oh thats what it was
[8:17:36] <TwistParabola> She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella.
[8:17:37] <bassoontyphoon> @patstaresat how can you face the girlboss supreme when you’re still just a boyemployee
[8:17:38] <%DashXero> "Just command grab."
[8:17:38] <%MartinOfLoxley> She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella
[8:17:39] <+sashagreenspiderqueen> she is malenia blade of miquella
[8:17:40] <sjcodan> BLADE OF MIQUELLA
[8:17:44] <TheProtomanBlues> Melina is really the anti Unga bunga
[8:17:45] <Sigma_190_Beta> She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella.
[8:17:45] <@DakotaMacDoodle> She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella.
[8:17:58] <RickyRelucent> @LittleBigQuebec Sadly your choice for a first run is really important, going spells/quality is def one of the frontrunners tho
[8:17:59] <+swesterly> @QueequegTheater you can't learn phase 1 as well with a summon
[8:18:00] <Finchit> oh rot pool that she would heal off of. thats nutty
[8:18:00] <+Nomenanza> lol
[8:18:03] <%Aeoneth> Welp I can't stay up till 2am so goodnight Pat and Chat.  GL with the fight Pat,  this took me 2 days of attempts
[8:18:04] <thesaverofhumens> LUL what does that even mean
[8:18:09] <@QueequegTheater> @QueequegTheater But you beat it easier
[8:18:09] <RickyRelucent> unsure how quality stands here
[8:18:10] <%jamsbybetty> FADC into command grab chefs kiss
[8:18:11] <senfood> chef boyemployee
[8:18:12] <%fanciful_fright> UH OH

[8:18:22] <@QueequegTheater> Who cares about learning it if mimic facetanks it
[8:18:24] <%ZephynM> ZephynM gifted a Tier 1 sub to anoldtoilet! They have given 6 Gift Subs in the channel!

[8:18:32] <$Emperor_Machinus> she killing your battery too!
[8:18:34] <+handfulofslugs> Girlboss is Gatekeeping the secrets and gaslighting herself.
[8:18:37] <%radiorosewater> pog stoot LiveSlug
[8:18:40] <+pkmamsters> Gaslight, Gatekeep, Girlboss, Blade of Miquella
[8:18:46] <Guardiansaiyan> Skyward Sword Fi back for REVENGE
[8:18:49] <%fanciful_fright> Don't forget to re apply frost
[8:18:54] <sjcodan> Is scarlet rot just gaslighting?
[8:18:57] <%strakillias> If you go naked can you get a better  roll to create distance or are swords too heavy?
[8:18:57] <%discoinfierno> Ey Tony! Do I need to get my ears checked or did she just say she was Malenia, Blade of Miquella?
[8:18:58] <Sigma_190_Beta> She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella.
[8:18:59] <%X2Eliah> jeez
[8:18:59] <Vermillion129> owowowowowow
[8:19:00] <rosabellamelantha> yes
[8:19:01] <Sigma_190_Beta> Yes.
[8:19:01] <%anoldtoilet> the blenderis so crazy
[8:19:03] <mrtanaka111> dive in
[8:19:03] <%MartinOfLoxley> She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella
[8:19:03] <%Agami23> nope
[8:19:03] <$OfficerMods> in theory yes
[8:19:04] <thesaverofhumens> yes if you're not locked on
[8:19:04] <Finchit> run and dodge away at the start
[8:19:05] <%EldritchBee> She
[8:19:06] <+Nomenanza> no idea
[8:19:06] <%dekkitout> In that armor, probably not
[8:19:06] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> eh
[8:19:06] <$Jaxnos> you have to get REALLY far away
[8:19:07] <sjcodan> YOU GOTTA SPRINT
[8:19:09] <Grunkle_Dan_> it was always luck for me
[8:19:09] <Akiyashi> you can run the first two, last one needs a dodge
[8:19:10] <xanerts> use shield
[8:19:10] <+Rigid_Digidi> If youre lucky
[8:19:10] <Sigma_190_Beta> But it has to be imediately.
[8:19:11] <sjcodan> SPRINT BABY
[8:19:12] <%VivalaDragoon> Eh
[8:19:13] <TwistParabola> yeah
[8:19:13] <%anoldtoilet> @ZephynM Thanks for the gift sub!
[8:19:13] <%Aeoneth> run from 1st volley., dodge into the 2nd and then away for the 3rd
[8:19:13] <@QueequegTheater> See that's why you need  summon to tank it
[8:19:14] <rosabellamelantha> you just need to start running the moment she goes up @PatStaresAt
[8:19:14] <@DakotaMacDoodle> yeah
[8:19:14] <TwistParabola> sprint
[8:19:15] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> bloodhound step gets you far enough away
[8:19:17] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt yes, to skip the first two parts of the combo
[8:19:18] <armadaofghosts> I guess it makes sense Lightning would be effective. All the metal prosthetics and all.
[8:19:18] <swordorwhip> She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella.
[8:19:19] <%whyskeywolfe> Yes, but you have to be at a decent distance and moving right away.
[8:19:19] <%dcentii> @PatStaresAt its run from first, roll into second, roll side for third
[8:19:20] <%EldritchBee> She's gaslighting herself, that's actually Miquella, blade of Malenia
[8:19:21] <mrtanaka111> or just dive in her direction
[8:19:21] <rosabellamelantha> I've done it consistently
[8:19:22] <+swesterly> @QueequegTheater learning the boss is kind of the point no?
[8:19:23] <+OneTrueAsshat> Second flurry you have to dodge in
[8:19:27] <$OfficerMods> BARRI CADE
[8:19:29] <Zebroneath> you have to run immediately, but even then she catches up on her follow ups
[8:19:31] <thesaverofhumens> locking on makes a slight delay in turning away from enemies
[8:19:34] <rudiciuscaesar> kinda wish after so many deaths she'd say "Bitch, please" on killing you
[8:19:36] <%anoldtoilet> psaBig psaOrb
[8:19:37] <Finchit> i dont wanna backseat too hard. but there is a very specific dodge sequence
[8:19:37] <Paperware> I hear you can avoid if you're up close, but the timing is rtricky
[8:19:37] <%dcentii> barricade lezzgo
[8:19:37] <@QueequegTheater> @QueequegTheater Why, I'm not being graded. A win is a win
[8:19:39] <riley_the_mudwing> @patstaresat Run from the first two combos and roll forward on the third
[8:19:42] <$Jaxnos> run super far, and then when she lands to restart you have to dodge toward her for the final flurry.
[8:19:45] <+swesterly> @dcentii for me running from the first two and into the third worked best
[8:19:46] <digaogrunge> GET BIGGER
[8:19:47] <+Rofiarf> tire her out!
[8:19:50] <$OfficerMods> FAT
[8:19:54] <%dcentii> oh do not block normal hits that is super not worth
[8:20:01] <+AyupaPupa> i dodge into 2nd and walk back from 3rd
[8:20:04] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> Just giving her free heals
[8:20:14] <+Rigid_Digidi> Bloodhound step gives you the bloodborne speed for the bloodborne fight
[8:20:18] <+swesterly> @QueequegTheater valid mentality
[8:20:19] <thesaverofhumens> what will break first, pats will or his controller?
[8:20:20] <%EldritchBee> Yeah you're just healing her
[8:20:23] <rudiciuscaesar> Pat! She's healing on blocks!
[8:20:25] <$Jaxnos> mmmm full heal
[8:20:27] <+AyupaPupa> she's got sick blockstrings
[8:20:29] <%dcentii> The only thing you should block is waterfowl dance
[8:20:30] <%EldritchBee> You're refilling HER estus
[8:20:30] <@QueequegTheater> 0 damage
[8:20:32] <%DashXero> This fight seems to punish you for using a shield...
[8:20:34] <rudiciuscaesar> even if she does no damage, she's healing on the blocked hits!
[8:20:35] <sjcodan> I mean still dodge, but at least you aren't just dying outright
[8:20:36] <sothatsprettybrutal> he knows
[8:20:44] <%fanciful_fright> She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella
[8:20:47] <@QueequegTheater> She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella
[8:20:49] <%dcentii> the only thing to block is the big attack, shield away for everything else
[8:20:49] <swordorwhip> She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella.
[8:20:50] <%EldritchBee> Use Tiche again, you nearly got her that time
[8:20:50] <%ZephynM> That life leach would irritate me lol
[8:20:52] <Sigma_190_Beta> @PatStaresAt I'd say start doing attempts with Tiche?
[8:20:53] <%MartinOfLoxley> She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella
[8:20:54] <@DakotaMacDoodle> She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella.
[8:20:57] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> She is called Malenia for a reason
[8:20:59] <thesaverofhumens> fun fact even if you bring her down to unlock additional moves, if she heals to full she retains all moves
[8:20:59] <xanerts> use shield for the big anime move
[8:21:02] <%Agami23> yeah this is the first darksouls boss i thought was absolute bullshit. because she heals on blocked hits
[8:21:03] <+swesterly> claws and bloodhound step are great for this, what a sick way to foight
[8:21:04] <rudiciuscaesar> that is not fair, how the fuck does she just get a heal, she isn't evne get chip damage...
[8:21:04] <%fanciful_fright> Having a shield is a great panic button for Waterfowl Dance imo
[8:21:05] <$OfficerMods> yeah blocking little baby hits isn't the best and again damage reduction means less heals
[8:21:11] <NewWillinium> The Healing on Blocks that are being 100% blocked kind of feels like bullshit no? At least require her to have to do actual DAMAGE to you somehow
[8:21:15] <digaogrunge> TICHE HAD THE BEST RUN SO FAR
[8:21:19] <rudiciuscaesar> might as well heal with each swing, whether it's at thin air or Pat
[8:21:22] <Sunstalker> Stuff like this is why I'm going shieldless second playthrough
[8:21:26] <+pkmamsters> Sometimes I wish I was Malenia, Blade of Miquella.
[8:21:35] <rudiciuscaesar> @NewWillinium I agree, that is total shit.
[8:21:35] <+Rigid_Digidi> Tiche is the real girl boss
[8:21:37] <%dcentii> naww if she couldn't heal on blocks this fight would be actually really easy
[8:21:45] <+Rigid_Digidi> NICE
[8:21:47] <+swesterly> @NewWillinium then people would just turtle
[8:21:47] <%SveriSageAdvice> NICE
[8:21:48] <sjcodan> @pkmamsters Even with all the rot?
[8:21:49] <it_came_from_outer_space> @NewWillinium if it didnt heal off of that it would just negate her gimmick entirely to use a shield
[8:21:49] <penitentpendant> Perfect!
[8:21:50] <RubberFistFight> SHE'S COMIN FOR YOUR ASS
[8:21:50] <%fanciful_fright> NICE
[8:21:50] <ArgentUndaCova> PogChamp
[8:21:50] <%pabloelenano2> yus
[8:21:51] <oda_flobunaga> Perfection
[8:21:52] <%BlackStarAura> fuck this fight
[8:21:55] <+RushUnplugged> "what if I simply walked away though"
[8:21:56] <riley_the_mudwing> hell yeah batman
[8:21:57] <TwistParabola> YES

[8:24:32] <%EldritchBee> Tiche doin numbers
[8:24:32] <TwistParabola> Let your flesh be consumed. By the scarlet rot.
[8:24:32] <+Rigid_Digidi> Doesnt that move hurt her?
[8:24:33] <%dcentii> she starts the fight at like 75% in phase 2
[8:24:33] <%SveriSageAdvice> i highly recommend BOOKING it because that drops a ton of rot on the ground too lol
[8:24:33] <%justcallmebobplease> Tiche had it.
[8:24:34] <+theoldone001> Pat you jumped right into the explosion lol
[8:24:34] <$sarah_galb> winnable
[8:24:34] <+Nomenanza> Tiche might actually do this
[8:24:35] <Vermillion129> phase 2 got no health
[8:24:35] <MoustacheCEO> Silver Chariot with AIDS powers
[8:24:35] <%Fenrisulfr_V> All attacks now apply rot :)
[8:24:35] <Sigma_190_Beta> She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella.
[8:24:36] <oda_flobunaga> BOOOOOOOSH
[8:24:36] <%ithonmage> one shot rot

[8:24:38] <%Maids4lyfe> YES
[8:24:38] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Half of that was her hurting herself actually
[8:24:39] <%justcallmebobplease> Didn't even need you.
[8:24:40] <%Pookiedaexzile> She's using your tricks
[8:24:41] <Gimplock> You know it's real when he adjusts his neck
[8:24:42] <Moonlight_Grimoire> I need to get that summon
[8:24:42] <TwistParabola> She starts phase 2 at 80%
[8:24:43] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Im convinced that Pat isnt the main character....it's Tiche
[8:24:43] <blue8moon> she actually starts the phase with missing health
[8:24:43] <NewWillinium> . Hey don't you also have a Blade of Death like Tiche? Do those attacks stack?
[8:24:44] <digaogrunge> TICHE CAN DO IT
[8:24:44] <%fanciful_fright> Tiche is one of the Godslayers if I recall
[8:24:44] <%greasypete00> her phase 2 is "you may look, but you may not touch" lol
[8:24:45] <%Ynkubus_> Tiche got the numbers and the zoomies
[8:24:46] <rudiciuscaesar> is this a girl boss even?
[8:24:48] <%luftraumm1> tiche is the goat
[8:24:48] <MicrotonalMatt> She starts at 75%
[8:24:49] <sothatsprettybrutal> tiche is wondering why your ass is holding her back
[8:24:49] <$sleepystardewfarmer> yikes
[8:24:49] <%boggsz12> you can totally beat her
[8:24:49] <+blitz31295> damn, tiche might be better than mimic for this fight
[8:24:49] <rudiciuscaesar> feel very unsure lol
[8:24:50] <%MartinOfLoxley> She blew up your B-Hole
[8:24:53] <XxMoliciousxX> Tiche: stop feeding
[8:25:02] <Sigma_190_Beta> @PatStaresAt Add the Miracle that cures rot.
[8:25:08] <sjcodan> Tiche could do the fight on her own
[8:25:08] <%X2Eliah> Now we know where Radahn learned his dumb meteor-crash-landing attack
[8:25:08] <thesaverofhumens> @blitz31295 depends on your gear
[8:25:13] <%imthewisejanitor> @sporeian94 That's how they get you. Stay strong, Kings.
[8:25:14] <bassoontyphoon> Tiche was the real girlboss the whole time
[8:25:20] <+blitz31295> Tiche is the support carrying the lane
[8:25:21] <@QueequegTheater> @blitz31295 Yeah but mimic charging into the flower like Guts is worth the trade-off, that's a proper shonen idiot hero
[8:25:26] <%boggsz12> @blitz31295 she actually dodges attacks so malenia cant heal off her as easily
[8:25:30] <djblue_shift> tiche screaming TOP IS FED
[8:25:31] <@QueequegTheater> Tiche is fed
[8:25:38] <rudiciuscaesar> I miss Oleg...
[8:25:39] <%X2Eliah> sploosh
[8:25:43] <sjcodan> KEEP RUNNING
[8:25:44] <neoscremlass> can you believe i was worried pat would oneshot malenia like he did morgott?
[8:25:47] <swordorwhip> She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella.
[8:25:47] <%MartinOfLoxley> She is Blade, Miquella OF Malenia
[8:25:48] <TwistParabola> She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella.
[8:25:50] <@DakotaMacDoodle> She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella.
[8:25:51] <@QueequegTheater> She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella
[8:25:51] <Sigma_190_Beta> Tiche is Screaming at you to stop feeding.
[8:25:52] <penitentpendant> Tiche is tryin' her best
[8:25:55] <%fanciful_fright> Tiche: LEASH BLUE, LEASH BLUE
[8:26:00] <sjcodan> RUN FOREVER AND JUST LET TICHE DO IT
[8:26:12] <%dcentii> also if you got the build for it aka bleed+frost with mimic you can end this fight in like 50 seconds
[8:26:13] <+MarkoTolstov> would a Rune Arc'd Godric Rune help out?
[8:26:15] <NewWillinium> So I've been saying her name like "Tye (like Tye-Dye)-Che".
[8:26:28] <+swesterly> i love malenia because unless you go full cheese you have no choice but to do the fight perfectly
[8:26:44] <%jamsbybetty> rune arc helps quite a bit
[8:26:46] <sjcodan> It's either Tyesh or Teeche
[8:26:47] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @NewWillinium I've been pronouncing it like quiche with a T.
[8:27:00] <%X2Eliah> @NewWillinium same
[8:27:01] <penitentpendant> @NewWillinium I just sidestep the issue and call her 'Knifu Waifu' summon
[8:27:04] <+RushUnplugged> tiche is a real name/last name though, kinda sounds like tick
[8:27:09] <neoscremlass> i think its pronouced tie-key
[8:27:10] <%MartinOfLoxley> This is kind of a curbstomp if it wasn't for the fact that she can two-shot you
[8:27:11] <digaogrunge> SIT DOWN SAYS TICHE
[8:27:19] <@QueequegTheater> Also, Siofra is pronounced "Chef-ra"
[8:27:24] <ArgentUndaCova> Damn, that dance between this lady that I don't know the name of,  and Tiche mopK
[8:27:26] <+blitz31295> gotta say tiche like sheesh
[8:27:28] <NewWillinium> MAN BARRACADE is so good
[8:27:31] <sjcodan> SEE? JUST BLOCK IT
[8:27:32] <%dekkitout> Wow, you no sold that string
[8:27:35] <TwistParabola> phew
[8:27:37] <sjcodan> I FUCKIN TOLD YALL
[8:27:42] <T_Sasquatch> BLOCK THAT BITCH
[8:27:43] <%MartinOfLoxley> BARRICADE IS RIDICULOUS!!!
[8:27:47] <NewWillinium> @QueequegTheater Man and here I've been calling it "C-oh-fra"
[8:27:50] <ohno58> YO WHAT
[8:27:52] <it_came_from_outer_space> @QueequegTheater Chef-ra(msay)
[8:27:52] <+sashagreenspiderqueen> @sjcodan "just block it" except she heals 25% of her lifebar through your block
[8:27:54] <riley_the_mudwing> Barricade shield does block it? good to know
[8:27:56] <it_came_from_outer_space> ramsey?
[8:28:02] <it_came_from_outer_space> idk his last name actually
[8:28:03] <rosabellamelantha> that only works if you have barricade which I did not
[8:28:11] <sjcodan> Sure she heals a bit BUT YOU DONT FUCKING DIE
[8:28:12] <%VHGS> Even if she heals, that's better than dying
[8:28:14] <@QueequegTheater> @QueequegTheater DW about it, Irish names are fucking stupid.  Saoirse is pronounce Sir-sha
[8:28:15] <+sashagreenspiderqueen> health bars should not fucking do that
[8:28:17] <%dcentii> her healing with waterfowl is better than you just dying
[8:28:19] <+OneTrueAsshat> @sashagreenspiderqueen he’s alive tho
[8:28:19] <oda_flobunaga> Barricade shield on a great shield specifically
[8:28:20] <+swesterly> it also only works because tiche counters the heal
[8:28:22] <%Fenrisulfr_V> Or if you actually have the Strength to use a Greatshield.
[8:28:26] <$Jaxnos> there's the bug
[8:28:28] <+Rofiarf> wait what
[8:28:29] <thesaverofhumens> healed
[8:28:30] <TwistParabola> LETS GO
[8:28:31] <@QueequegTheater> LUL
[8:28:31] <Sigma_190_Beta> Oh that glitch.
[8:28:32] <%pabloelenano2> the bug
[8:28:33] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> bugged out
[8:28:34] <sjcodan> Waterfoul doesnt even heal too much
[8:28:34] <sothatsprettybrutal> what happened there
[8:28:36] <%sporeian94> DID THEY PATCH THAT GLUTCH?
[8:28:36] <+Nomenanza> huh?
[8:28:36] <LittleBigQuebec> BLACK BLADE RAN OUT?
[8:28:38] <%radiorosewater> i feel like im watching a ZeroLenny stream
[8:28:39] <$Jaxnos> tiche bug. fire healed her
[8:28:39] <TwistParabola> the bug
[8:28:40] <%fanciful_fright> @sashagreenspiderqueen She heals, but in exchange you don't die.
[8:28:40] <%Willowight> the bug oh no
[8:28:42] <ArgentUndaCova> Dafuq just happened
[8:28:42] <+sashagreenspiderqueen> good boss very good
[8:28:48] <%Agami23> yeah i've noticed black flame bugs out sometimes like that
[8:28:50] <dante_must_die_exe> HUGE BUG OHNO
[8:28:51] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> tiche's bleed doesnt kill phase 1
[8:28:51] <NewWillinium> The Bug I've been talking about that people keep insisting doesn't exist
[8:28:53] <%dcentii> black blade debuff ran out
[8:28:54] <rudiciuscaesar> yeah, wtf was that?
[8:28:55] <+suicidallobo> its a mechanic where sometimes your or the enemies live with one hp
[8:28:55] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt You can't finish the phase with a crit for some reason, and the black flame ran out so she healed
[8:28:56] <oda_flobunaga> Black Blade RUNS out after 20 seconds
[8:28:59] <+Kinggarbage> SHES TOO STRONG
[8:29:04] <ArgentUndaCova> atpGasm atpGasm atpGasm
[8:29:07] <%retrohazard> I can't believe that is only part 1
[8:29:08] <+Rigid_Digidi> Tiche health critical
[8:29:11] <%twohitgood> you can't end phase 1 on a crit
[8:29:13] <%retrohazard> ridiculous
[8:29:13] <%imthewisejanitor> r u s s y
[8:29:14] <%VHGS> Gaining max health does not heal in this game. Black flame wearing off would not do that.
[8:29:18] <%jamsbybetty> sometimes her heal can lag and keep her alive at the end of phase 1
[8:29:18] <T_Sasquatch> Loooool
[8:29:20] <+pkmamsters> Rottie Rotten
[8:29:29] <thesaverofhumens> she has MORE SHIT

[8:30:08] <%dekkitout> It took an omega level turbo boss to kill Tiche. Best Girl.
[8:30:10] <sjcodan> HE LEARNED TO RUN AWAY!
[8:30:12] <MicrotonalMatt> Tiche tdogSad
[8:30:16] <WillSin4Cash> imagine attempting to engage in promiscuous activities, the pers9n said sorry just FYI I have the rot
[8:30:16] <it_came_from_outer_space> Full hp LUL
[8:30:18] <%Kiiper> Phase 2 WFD see
[8:30:19] <+blitz31295> tiche down, time for the double kill
[8:30:19] <+swesterly> alright now your summon is dead, use everything you learned when it was 2v 1
[8:30:20] <@QueequegTheater> BACK TO FULL
[8:30:20] <+eanscrale> Boy this fight REALLY wants you to use bloodhound step huh.
[8:30:21] <%justcallmebobplease> Did she just... Summon Self, in lieu of Summon Swords?  Throw simulacra of HERSELF at you as projectiles, complete with their own sword arms - is that what that move is?
[8:30:21] <sothatsprettybrutal> healthier than when she started
[8:30:21] <%EldritchBee> ! ROT !
[8:30:22] <tolloponik> summon swords that Pussy shit summon swordsman now thats where its at
[8:30:22] <%ZephynM> This must be what it's like to take Paige's last pizza.
[8:30:23] <%SilvaChariot0133> Oops ALL Rot
[8:30:23] <+Rigid_Digidi> FULL HEALTH
[8:30:24] <TwistParabola> Let your flesh be consumed. By the scarlet rot.
[8:30:25] <T_Sasquatch> SHE FULL HEALED
[8:30:27] <DracaenaLeaf> LUL
[8:30:28] <NewWillinium> And Pat waaaaaaaalks away
[8:30:29] <digaogrunge> FULLY HEALED
[8:30:32] <sjcodan> !!! ROT !!!
[8:30:34] <TwistParabola> LUL
[8:30:36] <%MartinOfLoxley> DAAAAAANG, Can you SMELL what She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella is cooking?!
[8:30:36] <sappinmahbinyot> LUL
[8:30:38] <$OfficerMods> thats the appropriate response
[8:30:39] <thesaverofhumens> pats just GONE
[8:30:39] <%strakillias> She hit you so many times she full healed off your shield
[8:30:39] <+blitz31295> and hes gne
[8:30:40] <%imthewisejanitor> He's getting Paige.
[8:30:40] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> She's cooler than Artorias. There I said it
[8:30:41] <goddesstabrasa> damn she makin artorias look like a cake walk
[8:30:41] <TheSandmanIsHere> her lifesteal is stronger
[8:30:41] <+sashagreenspiderqueen> this boss is just stupid as shit and needs to be both fixed and nerfed
[8:30:44] <MicrotonalMatt> LUL
[8:30:45] <TwistParabola> Phase 2 death count: 2
[8:30:45] <%Agami23> i kinda wish that the game didnt make you go through phase one again considering how tough they both are
[8:30:45] <@Spydurman> LUL
[8:30:45] <%greasypete00> so did the fight start in her second phase or was pat really quick at getting her back down
[8:30:46] <@QueequegTheater> aight imma head out LUL
[8:30:47] <oda_flobunaga> SO FUCKING GOOD
[8:30:50] <Varanoo> Pat had never seen such bullshit
[8:30:53] <IntrepidEye> it took me like 10 attempts on this phase and shes pulling out a bunch of shit I never saw
[8:30:53] <%jamsbybetty> pro tip: keep throwing knives on your bar for when she does her flower meteor so you can keep the damage up
[8:30:55] <sjcodan> @sashagreenspiderqueen Nah get good
[8:30:55] <%DashXero> Miyazaki: "No. Just dodge everything."
[8:30:56] <James_Quivers> I just beat this fight, here's a big tip: Hoarfrost Stomp is REALLY GOOD against her @PatStaresAt
[8:30:59] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> I wish we could learn her name
[8:31:00] <+MarkoTolstov> The entire time I fought her I thought that Millicent WAS Melania
[8:31:01] <%greasypete00> oh boy
[8:31:04] <ohno58> aight imma head out
[8:31:06] <%dcentii> naww as a hyper optional/hidden boss what she does is fine
[8:31:08] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> i mean, she's fully optional, so it doesnt necessarily have to be tuned
[8:31:12] <+Rigid_Digidi> me when I am Milenia, Blade of Miquella
[8:31:14] <digaogrunge> Buff Tiche, get some AOE heals, play the support
[8:31:15] <@Spydurman> @James_Quivers he tried
[8:31:20] <+sashagreenspiderqueen> @sjcodan *** yeah dude get good through a fundamentally broken boss
[8:31:22] <%discoinfierno> So how does she rank among all the badasses in from games? At least top 5 right?
[8:31:23] <rudiciuscaesar> just realized she's a super amputee. Clearly spending more time watching her attacks then looking at her design
[8:31:23] <Sigma_190_Beta> @PatStaresAt Maybe keep the healing for Tiche in the second phase?
[8:31:23] <+OneTrueAsshat> This fight is tuned perfectly
[8:31:26] <Sunstalker> I really do not like sekiro when playing as a dark souls :(
[8:31:32] <sjcodan> @sashagreenspiderqueen Yeah get good
[8:31:33] <+sashagreenspiderqueen> as a 10 year souls fan, souls fans shut up lol
[8:31:36] <@QueequegTheater> @sashagreenspiderqueen 1. the only thing it needs is to fix the number values 2. git gud lmao it's a superboss
[8:31:39] <manateeworkshop> WOW
[8:31:40] <Sigma_190_Beta> Like add some of those miracles to heal her up?
[8:31:42] <TwistParabola> She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella.
[8:31:45] <RyuuAoi> Pat gonna be hella mad at Peach for weeks after this one. She will be so confused. He will have flashbacks. LUL
[8:31:49] <James_Quivers> @James_Quivers Damn, really? Welp, guess he'll never beat her then lmao
[8:31:55] <sjcodan> @sashagreenspiderqueen Nah, just do it, get good, lmao
[8:31:57] <thesaverofhumens> @sashagreenspiderqueen damn we got 10 year olds in chat
[8:31:57] <+sashagreenspiderqueen> @sashagreenspiderqueen did you watch the same clip
[8:31:57] <+pkmamsters> Malenia, Blade of Milqussy
[8:32:00] <Sigma_190_Beta> @sashagreenspiderqueen Also the Glitch with regaining HP randomly.
[8:32:11] <@QueequegTheater> @sashagreenspiderqueen That's a game wide issue
[8:32:16] <sjcodan> IT DIDNT NOT WORK
[8:32:25] <Sigma_190_Beta> @sashagreenspiderqueen Fair.
[8:32:26] <@QueequegTheater> NOT CLEAR NOT CLEAR
[8:32:36] <sjcodan> That's a glitch with Tiche's black blade, not the boss
[8:32:40] <tolloponik> demi-god > dragon
[8:32:43] <James_Quivers> My critique for this fight is that it's great EXCEPT for the omnislash thing, it's way too overtuned and forces you into using a shield even if you don't want to
[8:32:48] <TwistParabola> She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella.
[8:32:51] <+blitz31295> if an optional boss is beatable what needs to be fixed?
[8:32:56] <digaogrunge> YOU THINK YOU CAN DO IT ALONE LUL
[8:32:59] <Sunstalker> I have never used Tiche's summon and not seen that bug once
[8:33:03] <%justcallmebobplease> I like that Phase 1, she JUST woke up and is fighting you in her bedroom, you need to beat a health bar off her before she wakes up properly for Phase 2.
[8:33:04] <%jamsbybetty> I tried poisoning myself to see if that counteracted the heal. It didn't LUL
[8:33:14] <+OneTrueAsshat> @james_quivers that attack is 100% dodgeable
[8:33:15] <@QueequegTheater> @Sunstalker Are you using black flame on enemies
[8:33:20] <+sashagreenspiderqueen> @James_Quivers the fact that she doesnt need to do damage to heal makes the fight miserable
[8:33:23] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @James_Quivers That's my big gripe. My entire first playthough I either dual wielded or two-handed, and I didn't have the Strength for ANY greatshield. Made the fight feel giga lame.
[8:33:23] <NewWillinium> So honest question. I keep seeing people say it and write it.  What does "Overtuned" *mean* in terms of a boss fight?
[8:33:26] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> @sjcodan I've seen it happened multiple times without using tiche or black flames
[8:33:27] <oda_flobunaga> Tiche's Black blade running out is a feature, not a bug
[8:33:32] <%Aeoneth> @James_Quivers Beat her without a shield,  but it was me and mimic going to town on her with dual bleed longswords with me periodically applying frost
[8:33:34] <MicrotonalMatt> Imagine people who have never played these games getting here
[8:33:34] <+HuoShengdi> a good time to use a breath attack is when she does the big flower bomb jn phase 2
[8:33:34] <Sunstalker> @Sunstalker Nope, none of the black flames
[8:33:36] <$Artoo__The_Me> I’ve seen people do a critical strike as the last hit and she is still good with no health
[8:33:36] <HeroToxiko> i love how i heard you say millicents name out loud and realized who she was LUL
[8:33:49] <%discoinfierno> @blitz31295 Literally starts the fight by warning you she's never lost
[8:33:57] <%ZephynM> @MicrotonalMatt I reckon it would take them a long time.
[8:33:57] <+swesterly> @James_Quivers doing it with claws and bloodhound step is the hypest shit
[8:33:58] <%dekkitout> For once, I'm not sure Greg has this
[8:34:01] <+RushUnplugged> @NewWillinium "I can't win so there must be something wrong with the game, it can't be that I need to adapt my strats"
[8:34:04] <oda_flobunaga> Overtuned means "I can't beat it, I wanna I wanna I wanna."
[8:34:05] <satiresatyr> i like rani a lot
[8:34:06] <sirrice77> @NewWillinium Overtuned means it's designed to deal with people who have incredibly min maxed and broken build instead of what a average person would have
[8:34:08] <+wizard_of_diamonds> BRUTAL
[8:34:09] <manateeworkshop> NICE
[8:34:14] <tolloponik> can't backstab her while she's winding up?
[8:34:15] <senfood> I can't believe you've committed suicide. I cannot believe you've committed suicide. How could you have done this? How could you have committed suicide?
[8:34:15] <TwistParabola> YEAH
[8:34:18] <%fanciful_fright> @NewWillinium Mostly just that the boss has too many mechanics. Honestly I personally don't think she's overtuned.
[8:34:19] <Sigma_190_Beta> HA HA.
[8:34:20] <Ghufufin> she got maaaad
[8:34:21] <Vermillion129> LUL
[8:34:22] <NewWillinium> And yes the Bug happens even without Black Flames on solo play or without Tiche. It's a thing
[8:34:23] <Sigma_190_Beta> She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella.
[8:34:23] <@QueequegTheater> I'M A GENIUS
[8:34:23] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> just because people have beaten this with insane restrictions doesnt mean the boss aint bs. cheese it as much as possible
[8:34:24] <@QueequegTheater> OH NO
[8:34:24] <+blitz31295> @NewWillinium people think they made her too strong
[8:34:24] <sjcodan> No backstabs
[8:34:25] <Dunkle321> Wait how do you even with that move???
[8:34:25] <%pabloelenano2> well...atleast you got a laught out of it
[8:34:26] <peachy996> What Haha?
[8:34:27] <@QueequegTheater> She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella.
[8:34:28] <+Glidemusic> you got vergil'd
[8:34:28] <boostergoldz> you can attune heals and have your mimic play healer
[8:34:28] <TwistParabola> She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella.
[8:34:29] <%radiorosewater> jmikeSadbungle jmikeSadbungle jmikeSadbungle
[8:34:30] <Evendrag> "I can jump attack too"
[8:34:30] <+Rigid_Digidi> Unless your in another zip code it might be better to block
[8:34:31] <James_Quivers> Oops she hit the I win button Pat, sorry
[8:34:33] <taylorpony> she melts if you use horefrost stomp
[8:34:35] <%fanciful_fright> She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella
[8:34:37] <rudiciuscaesar> man, no one clip that, that's a dark comment.
[8:34:38] <Vermillion129> that what u get for laughing pat LUL
[8:34:39] <+aaropoll> pat playing Tekken tag
[8:34:42] <RyuuAoi> Big damage though!
[8:34:42] <+sashagreenspiderqueen> @NewWillinium you can only counter the boss lifesteal on omnislash especially by rolling perfectly through it, blocking heals her
[8:34:43] <%greasypete00> i cant help you out of this one buddy
[8:34:43] <+Smokebanshee> I beat the fight by using mimic and dual bleed katanas, and I do feel the fight is ridiculous
[8:34:46] <thesaverofhumens> LUL
[8:34:46] <HeroToxiko> i also realized after she invaded me and used "the attack"
[8:34:49] <%radiorosewater> how could you have done this
[8:34:51] <%SilvaChariot0133> Peepee poopoo nyannHeh
[8:34:51] <%JonathLP> Oh, hi, Malenia
[8:34:53] <Vermillion129> nice username
[8:34:56] <HeroToxiko> Yeah that one
[8:35:00] <%imthewisejanitor> We're here. We Have reached the Breen stage of delerium.
[8:35:01] <+blitz31295> glad pat took the time to acknowledge that person lol
[8:35:02] <RubberFistFight> @Smokebanshee that's whgat im going with right now
[8:35:03] <%ZephynM> "Peepeepoopoo" immediately makes me think of Nyanners.
[8:35:04] <RubberFistFight> it's promising
[8:35:05] <%ZephynM> I love it
[8:35:05] <+sashagreenspiderqueen> if they removed that condition or reduced the heal it would be less miserable and thats from someone who's beaten the boss lmao
[8:35:06] <$OfficerMods> pink cat bad
[8:35:08] <NewWillinium> @sashagreenspiderqueen I think you meant to reply to another person there
[8:35:11] <Eye_of_the_red_giant> whats this characters nam again and who does she work for??
[8:35:13] <toyforus235> paige boss
[8:35:15] <oda_flobunaga> I beat her with Tiche and Bloodfly Swarm
[8:35:27] <it_came_from_outer_space> @sashagreenspiderqueen why shouldnt it be that difficult though? like actually
[8:35:28] <sjcodan> The boss is fine, its an OPTIONAL SUPERBOSS
[8:35:30] <+sashagreenspiderqueen> @NewWillinium you asked why it was overtuned
[8:35:31] <%fanciful_fright> Ye, maybe try Hoarfrost stomp with Tyche? That way she has the weakness and slowness debuff
[8:35:35] <@QueequegTheater> Mimic just fucking tanks it lmao
[8:35:41] <+HuoShengdi> I beat her with mimic, moonveil, and comet azur
[8:35:41] <+RedMaskBandit> nice
[8:35:41] <TwistParabola> HAHA-OH NO
[8:35:43] <+ScrapKingKeita> yeah she gets stronger on consecutive hits
[8:35:44] <rudiciuscaesar> oh this poster boss is optional?
[8:35:51] <rudiciuscaesar> she's in the trailer lol
[8:35:52] <Vermillion129> mimic tanks like a champ
[8:35:58] <sjcodan> If you can't beat her, that's fine, you literally don't need to
[8:36:09] <@QueequegTheater> @rudiciuscaesar extremely, you have to do an entire two optional zones to access it
[8:36:09] <taylorpony> i ahte she ehals even though you block
[8:36:09] <%ZephynM> Two of my co-workers aren't Souls gamers and they gave up on this game. One deleted his digital copy and the other is looking to sell his physical ps5 copy lol
[8:36:10] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @sjcodan Don't complain about horsefuck valley, it's an OPTIONAL SUPERARAEA.
[8:36:12] <rudiciuscaesar> wait, does that mean Radahn is optional? I only got Pat's fight with him, didn't see the whole stream for context
[8:36:16] <+HuoShengdi> yeah she's totally optional
[8:36:19] <%dekkitout> Greg can heal?
[8:36:20] <@QueequegTheater> @sjcodan @Fenrisulfr_V yes, unironically
[8:36:22] <thesaverofhumens> @rudiciuscaesar 99% of players wouldnt finish if it wasnt
[8:36:23] <%ZephynM> I'm a stubborn lad so I keep throwing myself at this wall until I break through.
[8:36:24] <oda_flobunaga> Like 80% of the content in the game is optional
[8:36:25] <+Smokebanshee> @sjcodan But shouldn't a fight be fun
[8:36:28] <RubberFistFight> if you can, let your mimic get the last hit, that way she focuses on him for her little flower charge and you can leg it
[8:36:29] <%X2Eliah> @ZephynM how far did they get?
[8:36:30] <sjcodan> PRECISELY
[8:36:32] <rudiciuscaesar> @QueequegTheater that is NUTZ lol.
[8:36:35] <+HuoShengdi> Radahn is also optional but you need to beat him for ranni quest
[8:36:36] <boostergoldz> 3 times NotLikeThis
[8:36:37] <+HaloIsA> how long has orbman been on malenia i just got here
[8:36:38] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @QueequegTheater lmao
[8:36:38] <@QueequegTheater> @rudiciuscaesar Shockingly few bosses are required
[8:36:52] <$OfficerMods> watching the speedrun i think there isn't a mandatory boss fight until the fuck boi twins
[8:36:53] <+imthinkingdarbys> @rudiciuscaesar most of the bosses are optional, i believe only 5 are required to finish
[8:36:53] <+RushUnplugged> @rudiciuscaesar strictly speaking you only need 2 shardbearers so you could avoid him
[8:36:57] <@QueequegTheater> @rudiciuscaesar Margit is optional
[8:37:03] <sjcodan> Just because I can't 1CC touhou doesn't mean its too hard
[8:37:03] <%fanciful_fright> @sjcodan Whose to say that it isn't fun?
[8:37:06] <%ZephynM> @ZephynM One with digital copy kept dying to the first Tree Sentinel and knew he didn't want to play anymore. The one with the PS5 explored some but he hates the boss fights lol.
[8:37:06] <%X2Eliah> I mean this boss is "required" if you want to find out wtf miquella is all about
[8:37:07] <boostergoldz> 4 times NotLikeThis
[8:37:12] <Vermillion129> @rudiciuscaesar yea, iirc you only need to beat 10-12 boss to finish the game
[8:37:14] <rReizs> feels gud to parry her 3 times in a row
[8:37:23] <%SilvaChariot0133> KABOOOOOM!
[8:37:24] <sjcodan> Fun is subjective. I had fun with this fight
[8:37:25] <Vermillion129> here we go again

[8:37:43] <TwistParabola> Phase 2 deaths: 3
[8:37:43] <%dekkitout> Greg held out too
[8:37:44] <sothatsprettybrutal> then perish

[8:37:45] <jnexgen717> What level are you again pat ?
[8:37:46] <MagmaLycan> nukes the whole room
[8:37:47] <senfood> Her second phase is so fucking stupid.
[8:37:47] <@QueequegTheater> I love how Mimic just fucking Leeroy Jenkins his way in
[8:37:48] <cavefishes> BOOM
[8:37:49] <sjcodan> THE ROTUSSY TOO STANK
[8:37:50] <%luftraumm1> that kaboom8s crazy
[8:37:51] <RyuuAoi> Pat's gone madM
[8:37:52] <+sashagreenspiderqueen> @X2Eliah nah its okay to have fundamentally broken overloaded bosses if theyre optinoal apparently
[8:37:53] <%strakillias> I can't fucking wait to see Paige fight this boss in the future
[8:37:53] <+blitz31295> goota roll run and roll again for that damn flower
[8:37:54] <taylorpony> horefrost melts her
[8:37:55] <$Artoo__The_Me> Get Lotussied
[8:37:55] <$realm_forge> splat
[8:37:56] <NewWillinium> I found that the trick was to run *under* her and away that way
[8:37:57] <%jamsbybetty> pro tip: at the start of phase 2 run under her and she'll miss the flower meteor
[8:38:02] <rudiciuscaesar> idk how I feel about the optional bosses thing, since that's content you could miss, like, I guess it adds replay value?
[8:38:03] <tanarath> 165 or 166 now?
[8:38:03] <MoustacheCEO> This fight is fun if you love total bullshit
[8:38:04] <Sigma_190_Beta> @PatStaresAt Can you go Light Roll?
[8:38:07] <turtlebits64> that is actually totally garbage
[8:38:09] <+HaloIsA> I had to learn to count the seconds on the second phase
[8:38:11] <tolloponik> is this the closest to a visualization of a fight between Femto vs Guts and Skeleton knight
[8:38:11] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @sjcodan And I was miserable the entire time. I eventually just used Rivers of Blood and a Mimic. I don't LIKE having to cheese bosses to beat them
[8:38:13] <%dcentii> because mimic can't get scarlet rot he does way better in phase 2 than 1
[8:38:13] <+RedMaskBandit> good job
[8:38:17] <NewWillinium> Like don't stop under her, but run under and past her
[8:38:18] <sothatsprettybrutal> drakengard 3's performance looking better than usual
[8:38:19] <$OfficerMods> People warn you the entire game "don't even think about taking on gods its way too hard"
[8:38:19] <turtlebits64> gotta roll it
[8:38:20] <taylorpony> can block the blade and explosion too
[8:38:21] <Khester824> You gotta bloodborne dodge
[8:38:22] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> running under wont work
[8:38:27] <cavefishes> if you had backrolled agian you would have been safe too
[8:38:27] <%ZephynM> @ZephynM I'm level 100 or so and I'm burning out but I'm really really stubborn so I always come back another time.
[8:38:27] <+suicidallobo> wonder how many runs pat has in him before he breaks like me and just pulls out the bloodhound claws
[8:38:36] <boostergoldz> it's not cheese you're using the tools the game gives you
[8:38:37] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> @strakillias Paige would be the one to one shot both forms lol
[8:38:44] <sjcodan> I mean, you didn't HAVE to cheese it, you chose to. And that's fine. But the fight's good
[8:38:49] <%Aeoneth> Mimic is done with this shit
[8:38:49] <Sigma_190_Beta> Greg hard carrying once again.
[8:38:50] <NewWillinium> @I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I It absolutely will. Especially for that initial bombing.
[8:38:51] <+sashagreenspiderqueen> @rudiciuscaesar its also not optional if you want one of the endings anyway but its a stupid argument to begin with, you dont have to play the game either
[8:38:53] <IntrepidEye> first phase I thought was fun. second phase I hated but only because of the healing otherwise I liked it
[8:38:57] <%ZephynM> I don't do 100% runs though if I'm not obsessed with the game. I managed 100% Sekiro, Scarlet Nexus and Evil Within 2.
[8:39:01] <@QueequegTheater> @sjcodan That's not cheese
[8:39:05] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> you still need to dodge when it impacts
[8:39:05] <+Rigid_Digidi> I respeced my build 3 times trying this fight
[8:39:15] <%luftraumm1> what's the episode shinai and asuka have to be in perfect sync? you gotta do that with gregg
[8:39:16] <@QueequegTheater> Cheese is sneaking past the gold mist to turn off their AI
[8:39:19] <+swesterly> the fight is difficult but learnable, when you learn it and can read what's coming it feels really good to just dodge everything, 'fun' is subjective, and you can always just cheese it
[8:39:20] <James_Quivers> Oh yeah, and if you can cast the incantation that heals scarlet rot, have it equipped so your mimic can use it on themselves for phase 2 because they ALWAYS run into the flower, lmao
[8:39:30] <sjcodan> He himself called it chesse, I was just agreeing with him
[8:39:37] <+RushUnplugged> "if I don't win naked with a greatsword, it's cheese and bad design"
[8:39:39] <+HaloIsA> this fight was only doable for me after I put hoarfrost stomp on nagakiba and spammed frost/bleed
[8:39:39] <%dekkitout> Our hero Greg
[8:39:41] <%dcentii> mimics can't get scarlet rot, they are just taking the damage the flower does
[8:39:44] <oda_flobunaga> Summons can't get statused
[8:39:45] <boostergoldz> i really like that she's not invincible on knockdown
[8:39:48] <@QueequegTheater> @sjcodan I was telling him, not you
[8:39:50] <%dekkitout> SO BASED
[8:39:55] <taylorpony> mimic has no fear!
[8:39:55] <James_Quivers> LEROY
[8:39:57] <halfmasks> YO
[8:39:58] <%pabloelenano2> greg dosnt give a fuck
[8:39:59] <%Aeoneth> Mimic doesn't care about Rot
[8:40:01] <sjcodan> GREG DONT CARE
[8:40:01] <@QueequegTheater> LEEROY MMMJEENNNNNKIIINNNNS
[8:40:02] <Estwilde> Mimic no fear
[8:40:03] <NewWillinium> Mimic: LORD OF THE FACE TANK
[8:40:04] <TheBlankAce> Greg has balls
[8:40:04] <%greasypete00> tiche is fucking unreal
[8:40:04] <TwistParabola> NO FEAR
[8:40:05] <$OfficerMods> the mimic is just you but better
[8:40:05] <rosabellamelantha> GREG IS BASED
[8:40:06] <%Aeoneth> He should, but he doesn't
[8:40:06] <%jamsbybetty> she's not too ridiculous. she just has a couple of moves that hard hard to deal with. the heal is the biggest obstacle honestly
[8:40:07] <%dekkitout> Heaven forbid g
[8:40:09] <halfmasks> GREG GIVES NO SHITS
[8:40:11] <satiresatyr> oh beautiful she's like a harpy
[8:40:12] <+sashagreenspiderqueen> @HaloIsA same i just had to change my entire build for this fight and spam hoarfrost through it and even then it was bullshit
[8:40:13] <digaogrunge> GO GO GREGGGG
[8:40:17] <%dcentii> mimic eats damage for breakfast
[8:40:18] <thesaverofhumens> mimic stronk
[8:40:19] <NewWillinium> After a while The Mimec just completely replaces Lhutel
[8:40:20] <rudiciuscaesar> @sashagreenspiderqueen I'm just saying from an artistic design standpoint, if this wasn't a FromSoft game, and well known for hiding stuff in it, a casual player would totally miss stuff, which is a shame, the developers put time and effort into it, their work should be enjoyed in the fullest.
[8:40:22] <+Rigid_Digidi> nice roll greg
[8:40:25] <freddiefreeloader_> you can run in while the flower is still there but fading and not get rot
[8:40:25] <Vermillion129> GO GREGGGGG
[8:40:26] <sjcodan> WHY IS GREG SO MUCH STRONGER THAN YOU
[8:40:26] <James_Quivers> WOMBO COMBOOOOO
[8:40:30] <+sashagreenspiderqueen> @jamsbybetty the heal is basically my entire complaint
[8:40:30] <AtisutoCurry> GREG GREG HES OUR MAN
[8:40:30] <sjcodan> HE DIDNT EVEN BLOCK IT
[8:40:31] <%dekkitout> And you tellin me Greg could* use a healing spell?
[8:40:32] <oda_flobunaga> This is a Good Run
[8:40:34] <senfood> oh my god that heal on hit
[8:40:38] <boostergoldz> twice in a row NotLikeThis
[8:40:45] <senfood> SHE HEALS WHEN SHE HITS GREG
[8:40:46] <halfmasks> GREG YOURE CRAZY
[8:40:47] <%greasypete00> i didnt realize her legs were prosthetic as well
[8:40:47] <%Pookiedaexzile> Greg was the Favored Son
[8:40:52] <MoustacheCEO> back to 66% LUL
[8:41:02] <sjcodan> Yeah, she heals even if she hits a SHIELF
[8:41:02] <%dekkitout> o7
[8:41:03] <$OfficerMods> bye greg
[8:41:04] <@QueequegTheater> Goodbye Tiche, Mimic is my new best friends

[8:41:06] <penitentpendant> Greg Defeated
[8:41:07] <AtisutoCurry> NOOOOOOOOOOOO GREG
[8:41:07] <+sashagreenspiderqueen> @senfood the summons have tank AI and int feed her as well lol
[8:41:07] <thesaverofhumens> SUMMON ANOTHER
[8:41:07] <Lulu19> mimic just giving her health in phase 2
[8:41:10] <+Rigid_Digidi> sleep now Greg, good work warrior
[8:41:11] <Vermillion129> GREGGGG NOOOOOOO
[8:41:13] <+blitz31295> shadow clone time?
[8:41:14] <NewWillinium> Why can she grow Rot Wings but not a Rot Arm?
[8:41:17] <digaogrunge> GREEEEEEEG
[8:41:20] <+blitz31295> called it
[8:41:20] <pi_in_the_sci> can you bring in tiche now?

[8:41:28] <tanarath> f
[8:41:30] <cyberjellyfist> Thats the thing with this fight, dodge into and through her attacks, keep the pressure on her up 100%. Gives her less opportunity to attack and heal. Stagger her ass. You already got this.
[8:41:30] <bassoontyphoon> Does her design imply that the butterflies in game are derived from the rot?
[8:41:30] <TwistParabola> Let your flesh be consumed. By the scarlet rot.
[8:41:31] <MoustacheCEO> @Lulu19 Lets you aggro swap though
[8:41:31] <sjcodan> O O P A W W
[8:41:32] <%dekkitout> Greg is the real superboss
[8:41:33] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> only 1 summon per fight
[8:41:33] <TigerClaws12> phase 2-2
[8:41:33] <Vermillion129> I NEVER SAW THAT MOVE
[8:41:36] <Guardiansaiyan> I SAW HER ASS
[8:41:37] <@QueequegTheater> That Stand attack is some bullshit
[8:41:41] <oda_flobunaga> She's basically Slan
[8:41:44] <thesaverofhumens> @NewWillinium her limbs got rotted off
[8:41:45] <%luftraumm1> good job
[8:41:46] <digaogrunge> HEALS FOR GREG
[8:41:48] <+imthinkingdarbys> why would you need a new arm if you've got that sick as prosthetic?
[8:41:53] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @QueequegTheater DOn't complain, it's an optional superboss
[8:41:56] <+HuoShengdi> summons help but you really have to keep up the pressure
[8:41:57] <%strakillias> Anybody else hear the RLM technology failing beep boop noises when she moves her arm around?
[8:41:58] <RustyQuarters> FeelsBadMan
[8:42:01] <@QueequegTheater> @QueequegTheater I'm not complaining
[8:42:02] <%ZephynM> I hope I don't find her because I'm going to be too stubborn to give up lmao
[8:42:06] <it_came_from_outer_space> @sashagreenspiderqueen and thats cool!!!! like its a new mechanic and having it be detrimental for this feels like  a nice subversion imo
[8:42:07] <+HuoShengdi> can't let her beat on the summon too much
[8:42:12] <%ZephynM> I'd probably be stuck on her for a few days like I was with the final boss in DS3.
[8:42:13] <+swesterly> the spirits can be dodged mostly through sprinting in one direction and rolling the ones that come straight for you but you have to leave room to dodge her stinger at the end of the spirit summon
[8:42:23] <Sigma_190_Beta> @PatStaresAt Maybe Add some Healing Miracles to your Bar for Greg to use up?
[8:42:24] <+RealMichaelPhelps> its late
[8:42:26] <%dcentii> dodge into her. proceeds to roll away exclusively
[8:42:27] <James_Quivers> Yeah the best way to fight her is by out-aggroing her, but even that's tough when sometimes she just stops staggering lol
[8:42:37] <taylorpony> that heal is outrageous
[8:42:37] <+blitz31295> i gave my mimic a bow and just aggro swapped like crazy as i i used dual bleed katanas, i dont think adapting is chesing
[8:42:37] <TwistParabola> She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella.
[8:42:38] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt If you equip heal miracles, mimic uses them
[8:42:39] <$OfficerMods> what i generally like to do with shield is have it up and try to dodge, if i do it too late i just block
[8:42:41] <+hybridfusio> This boss is tough as hell. Good luck
[8:42:44] <NewWillinium> I have to say that "Don't complain it's obtional" seems kind of shitty.   Of course people are going to complain about optional bosses. People complained about Raime all the time back in the day.
[8:42:46] <%strakillias> Gief would eat her
[8:42:47] <%Aeoneth> She really punishes panic rolling,  but her 28hit combo is SUPER terrifying
[8:42:47] <penitentpendant> Behold! Paige's Final Form!
[8:42:51] <+MarkoTolstov> Kirby: Butterfly is an ancient evil(??)cosmic entity. Elden Ring: there are butterflies created from life destroying rot. Why all the butterfly hate? :(
[8:43:02] <%dekkitout> What cheese would you be, chat?
[8:43:08] <$OfficerMods> japan
[8:43:09] <Grabnok> a barbed greatsword? is that found up north?
[8:43:21] <deviljhojho_> whats the idea
[8:43:25] <@QueequegTheater> @Grabnok Rykard
[8:43:26] <oda_flobunaga> Yeah, don't do that
[8:43:29] <Sigma_190_Beta> @Grabnok Nah, it's a boss weapon.
[8:43:30] <NewWillinium> Is the idea to level up to level 200?
[8:43:31] <TwistParabola> She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella.
[8:43:32] <+sashagreenspiderqueen> @NewWillinium its just the same "git gud" shit that fromboys have always deployed
[8:43:32] <+hybridfusio> If I could make one recommendation, it would be to use bleed. She can heal her health bar, but bleed stack stays
[8:43:32] <$OfficerMods> in japan butterflies basically mean death
[8:43:36] <sothatsprettybrutal> jellyfish will win this one
[8:43:39] <+aaropoll> she isn't a mainline boss?
[8:43:40] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> Is the ideia killing her ?
[8:43:43] <%dekkitout> Bow only fight?
[8:43:45] <@QueequegTheater> Is the idea to drown her in your own bodies?
[8:43:47] <$Artoo__The_Me> @markotolstov Gundam turn A, butterfly destroy world :)
[8:43:49] <+blitz31295> is the idea to let her remain undefeated? she deserves it tbh
[8:43:53] <%jamsbybetty> this whole area and boss feels like DLC that you're supposed to be 40 levels over the main game for lol
[8:43:53] <Sunstalker> @Grabnok It's a boss weapon. There is a Flamberge down in Caelid though, if you fancy it
[8:43:55] <%dcentii> pat should get huger, come back at level 300 and then realize that she still does the same amount of damage
[8:43:59] <rudiciuscaesar> @aaropoll apparnetly not, she's an optional superboss
[8:44:02] <NewWillinium> She's a mainline Lore boss, but not a main path boss
[8:44:10] <%Aeoneth> @dekkitout fuck i have no idea how I'm going to do this on my bow only playthrough
[8:44:15] <+swesterly> yeah you can't panic roll at all, rolls have to be perfect, same when you go offensive, you shouldn't spam attacks because when her stagger wears off she can punish you and take back all the progress you made, or go into the flurry and if you are spamming you wont be able to run away in time
[8:44:18] <NewWillinium> @QueequegTheater Hey that was my strategy for the Final boss. It *eventually* worked
[8:44:25] <+hybridfusio> Goo boy gonna heal her a lot
[8:44:27] <%dekkitout> @dekkitout With the wii zapper, duh
[8:44:29] <@QueequegTheater> @dekkitout I have the answer.  You're not
[8:44:41] <+swesterly> this fight is designed specifically to punish the gut reaction to panic and try to out dps
[8:44:41] <+blitz31295> big brain
[8:44:48] <MaraSmug> This boss made me hurt moon2SUFFER
[8:44:48] <%luftraumm1> is the lore for this game just that tumblr post about fungi being eldritch horrors? decay is an extant for of life, you cannot kill me in any way that matters stuff?
[8:44:50] <$OfficerMods> @Aeoneth use a shield to block her spammy bullshit and serpent bow+arcane her with status
[8:44:52] <Lulu19> lol
[8:44:52] <$OfficerMods> ALL the status
[8:45:04] <%dcentii> look at him spammin hoarfrost he really is a player
[8:45:05] <tri3dgE027> mmmmm Lifesteal
[8:45:06] <RustyQuarters> JUMP HER ASS
[8:45:07] <Sigma_190_Beta> @PatStaresAt Also add some Healing to your bar so that Greg has something to do whenever he decides to one hand.
[8:45:07] <Lulu19> ouch
[8:45:09] <%ZephynM> Time for me to watch anime and play games. GLHF buds.
[8:45:13] <+hybridfusio> Look at them heals
[8:45:16] <%Zundelle> but tons of people like this sort of boss and it's optional, you'd be taking away a fight people enjoy just because you don't like it
[8:45:18] <+CherteuseKapibara> dat combo
[8:45:19] <NewWillinium> YES! BULLY HER!
[8:45:20] <%theeffay> C L A N G
[8:45:21] <rudiciuscaesar> so Pat must become a Marlboro and stack the status effects, I like where this is going.
[8:45:23] <coziestbank> @patstaresat Could you also put the aggro attracting tailisman on your mimic and then switch it?
[8:45:26] <+RushUnplugged> @luftraumm1 only part of it
[8:45:27] <James_Quivers> specifically, Hoarfrost on a bleed weapon absolutely melts her, I got phase 2 down in less than a minute
[8:45:28] <+sashagreenspiderqueen> @luftraumm1 guys in power broke the world to keep power now you have to do the same thing or dont (same as all other souls games and also bloodborne)
[8:45:29] <%dekkitout> FrostiestGreg in going ham
[8:45:29] <Grabnok> do Mimics not swap between the weapons you have equipped and just use the weapon you're holding? I sweat mine has swapped to my seal before to cast spells
[8:45:41] <%Agami23> wow, its weird seeing you and your mimic pontiff sulyvyning the enemy
[8:45:42] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @Zundelle From Software killed my Pure Faith build in DS2 because other players complained about it.
[8:45:46] <+sashagreenspiderqueen> @Grabnok they swap
[8:45:48] <%X2Eliah> @Grabnok yeah
[8:45:51] <+blitz31295> just wailing on a boss with my mimic is my favorite part of this game tbh
[8:45:56] <Lulu19> yea if you put healing and support spells in your quickslots the mimic will use them, same with items and they have unlimited
[8:45:56] <cavefishes> mimic will swap weapons yeah
[8:45:59] <+RushUnplugged> @Grabnok they do, they use everything you have equipped, including items on your item bar
[8:46:00] <Grabnok> ok
[8:46:17] <+RushUnplugged> Perfumes are actually awesome to have for the Mimic
[8:46:25] <%Pookiedaexzile> "Elden Ring Needs an Easy Mode"
[8:46:27] <+blitz31295> health too low
[8:46:29] <deviljhojho_> bro....
[8:46:33] <RyuuAoi> Let the butterflies spread until the dawn
[8:46:33] <Aldesso> @PatStaresAt did you see the clip of a japansese player stacking every single attack buff in the game and one shotting Malenia?
[8:46:35] <+Cuon_Alpinus> so that was a fuckin lie
[8:46:36] <+swesterly> >side sprinting
[8:46:36] <penitentpendant> "Running Under" didn't work
[8:46:36] <rudiciuscaesar> that's kinda horseshit
[8:46:37] <Zap_Rowsdower32> Jebaited
[8:46:37] <James_Quivers> Gotta RUN under her quick
[8:46:38] <halfmasks> .....
[8:46:39] <TwistParabola> Let your flesh be consumed. By the scarlet rot.
[8:46:40] <oda_flobunaga> DED, D E D DED
[8:46:42] <taylorpony> you can block through that
[8:46:43] <dante_must_die_exe> LUL
[8:46:43] <xerotwo> FamilyMan O O P A W W 󠀀
[8:46:45] <cavefishes> you hoesntly wanna dodge back
[8:46:47] <Sunstalker> How bad is Iron Flesh for this fight?
[8:46:50] <%jamsbybetty> keep throwing knives on your belt for when you can't approach, helps when she's healng or in her scarlet rot fog, I did probably half a health bar's worth when I beat her
[8:46:51] <+MarkoTolstov> you should use Godric's rune haha
[8:46:51] <@QueequegTheater> RUN UNDER HER THAT WILL WORK Kappa
[8:46:53] <TwistParabola> that's not side sprinting
[8:46:55] <RustyQuarters> DansGame WAT
[8:46:56] <%dekkitout> @Aldesso That sounds hype
[8:46:57] <RubberFistFight> so running towards and under her so the camera kinda flips around when she's doing her flower thing seems to work
[8:47:02] <satiresatyr> no i only saw the study one
[8:47:04] <it_came_from_outer_space> @Zundelle your pure faith build affected other players in pvp to be fair (I think they shouldn't have but there is rationale for it)
[8:47:04] <Grabnok> yeah I've considered having my mimic use a great bow. dunno if that's a good idea
[8:47:04] <TigerClaws12> the monster hunter experience
[8:47:06] <TwistParabola> one-shot per phase
[8:47:06] <$OfficerMods> @Sunstalker very bad unless you have great dps
[8:47:08] <RustyQuarters> You are def getting better tho @PatStaresAt
[8:47:10] <+RushUnplugged> usual Hyper damage buff-stacking but yes, literal one-shot
[8:47:16] <satiresatyr> where the college student has to study everytime he dies
[8:47:19] <James_Quivers> @QueequegTheater it will if you actually run and don't take a sippy first, honest :P
[8:47:23] <@QueequegTheater> @Sunstalker bad
[8:47:24] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @it_came_from_outer_space My pure Faith build was PvE only.
[8:47:24] <+sashagreenspiderqueen> @RubberFistFight you can block the dive bomb and aftershock aoe both with a good enough shield and stam bar
[8:47:25] <coziestbank> Sooooo, if you put the sleep grease on the mimics item slot before summoning....
[8:47:25] <HeroToxiko> can somebody whisper me that clip
[8:47:29] <NewWillinium> Running under and past her ABSOLUTELY works. It's what got me to survive her Phase 2 100% of the time
[8:47:30] <+swesterly> has anyone else noticed that activating runes seem to make enemies and bosses even more aggressive?
[8:47:31] <%Aeoneth> I thought that blood stain was a red phantoim for a sec and I was like WUT
[8:47:36] <%Felhad> technically 2 shot her
[8:47:37] <+blitz31295> you can dodge her phase 2 dive in any direction, just gotta roll again when it blooms
[8:47:42] <rudiciuscaesar> aw man, I just went and looked at that clip, that's a good one, whoever mentioned that, thanks for pointing it out.
[8:47:45] <%Felhad> 1 hit for each phase
[8:47:45] <Sunstalker> @OfficerMods I guess fire or ice dragonbreathe and capping FP could work?
[8:47:51] <+RedMaskBandit> fucker was insane
[8:47:58] <@QueequegTheater> Mimic seems better at this game, maybe he should be the streamer
[8:48:08] <+sashagreenspiderqueen> the aoe divebomb is one of the few things you can actually just block without consequence unlike the stand attack (shreds any stam bar)
[8:48:14] <$OfficerMods> @Sunstalker possibly
[8:48:17] <+RushUnplugged> GregStaresAt
[8:48:17] <%dekkitout> @QueequegTheater I'd tier 3 sub to Greg
[8:48:23] <+sashagreenspiderqueen> youll get a sliver of SR buildup but thats about it
[8:48:27] <+blitz31295> he upgraded mimic right?
[8:48:27] <@QueequegTheater> GregGazesAt
[8:48:31] <TheSandmanIsHere> Pat is just John Ring, mimic is Sir Elden John
[8:48:35] <NewWillinium> I swear that some of the bosses in this game feel hyper aware of your button presses. The *millisecond* you go to drink they've either thrown something at you, or got you in a chokehold
[8:48:36] <+Cuon_Alpinus> you can also just dodge the flower dive, then mash dodge away until the bloom finishes
[8:48:38] <%fanciful_fright> @QueequegTheater What are you talking about? Thats just Pat summoned in to help Greg.
[8:48:45] <%dekkitout> GregGlancesAt
[8:48:46] <James_Quivers> This fight with mimic is amazing because it looks like two 3rd graders teaming up and wailing on a 6th grader, lmao
[8:48:48] <djblue_shift> but what if he was power stancing tho
[8:48:50] <%Agami23> rycards weapon is nearly a garenteed knockdown so that makes sense
[8:48:51] <%Aeoneth> Why not have Him dual weild the sword?
[8:48:53] <Sigma_190_Beta> @PatStaresAt When is Greg starting his channel GregGazesAt?
[8:48:56] <digaogrunge> maybe you use stomp then
[8:48:58] <+sashagreenspiderqueen> @NewWillinium bosses have read inputs since ds1, you could bait gwyn by healing after a parry
[8:49:00] <rudiciuscaesar> who dis again lol
[8:49:00] <%dcentii> @PatStaresAt any temp item that buffs damage that you put on your hotbar the mimic can use infinitely
[8:49:01] <Grabnok> perhaps I should upgrade my vigor. I'm super focused on being able to use as many weapons as possible that I end up neglecting it and getting one shot so often.
[8:49:02] <%dekkitout> Wait, GregGandersAt
[8:49:05] <TwistParabola> She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella
[8:49:06] <LittleBigQuebec> is there a reason we are using mogh's rune?
[8:49:08] <@QueequegTheater> do it no balls
[8:49:10] <+blitz31295> GregGlaresAt
[8:49:12] <@QueequegTheater> She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella
[8:49:14] <Gamer76255> Your fire is curing the frost
[8:49:15] <RustyQuarters> greedy boi
[8:49:15] <%fanciful_fright> Maybe you use Hoarfrost and let summon use the Rykard weapon?
[8:49:18] <coziestbank> a throw away poison weapon in the offhand?
[8:49:18] <+RushUnplugged> @James_Quivers who would win, 10 duck-sized horses vs 1 horse-sized duck
[8:49:19] <MicrotonalMatt> GregGazesToward
[8:49:28] <%jamsbybetty> use a rune arc man helps a lot
[8:49:29] <rudiciuscaesar> @TwistParabola thanks
[8:49:31] <NewWillinium> @LittleBigQuebec Looks cool and Pat doesn't use the Great Runes anyhow
[8:49:46] <+blitz31295> @James_Quivers probably malenia, blade of miquella
[8:49:46] <%dekkitout> @James_Quivers What's a normal duck's carry capacity?
[8:49:50] <James_Quivers> @PatStaresAt If you have any colossal weapons you like, their jump heavys straight up knock her FLAT ON THE GROUND for big follow up damage
[8:49:50] <Grabnok> GIVE THAT BITCH A WUMPING
[8:49:52] <thesaverofhumens> @James_Quivers duck you just get a dinosaur
[8:49:54] <@QueequegTheater> @jamsbybetty What if he needs it later
[8:50:08] <RubberFistFight> YEEEEESSSSSSS I JUST DOWNED THE BITCH
[8:50:13] <rudiciuscaesar> oh man that was optimal.
[8:50:14] <@QueequegTheater> woo
[8:50:29] <@QueequegTheater> @rudiciuscaesar It's even better when you have 4 UGS
[8:50:30] <+RushUnplugged> GO GREG
[8:50:32] <%jamsbybetty> @QueequegTheater oh yeah for Malenia 2: Rot Around the Clock
[8:50:46] <+imthinkingdarbys> it makes sense but the fact you can get hung up on your summon is very annoying sometimes
[8:50:46] <+TheBitingIrish> Just spam the weapon art and juggle aggro LUL
[8:50:52] <%dekkitout> Champion of our hearts, Greg
[8:50:53] <+blitz31295> hes getting phase 1 down
[8:50:53] <James_Quivers> Why is mimic tear trying to be bootleg Oleg lol
[8:50:56] <rudiciuscaesar> @QueequegTheater 4 UGS? Not familiar with that term
[8:51:01] <NewWillinium> Man you can activate Barricade reaaaal fast huh?
[8:51:05] <MikeCosimano> Oh I tuned in at the right time
[8:51:05] <Grabnok> OOF
[8:51:07] <oda_flobunaga> WOW
[8:51:09] <@QueequegTheater> @rudiciuscaesar Ultra greatswords
[8:51:11] <Midnight188> oh good i idnt miss a kill
[8:51:12] <@QueequegTheater> She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella
[8:51:12] <%fanciful_fright> OOF. AIR STINGER
[8:51:13] <%Agami23> do you take more damage when you're jumping?
[8:51:16] <%Pookiedaexzile> HER NAME IS
[8:51:18] <James_Quivers> Guys, what's this bosses name again?
[8:51:20] <TwistParabola> She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella.
[8:51:20] <@DakotaMacDoodle> She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella.
[8:51:25] <NewWillinium> This is the Way
[8:51:27] <+Jasek7> i gave up bleed for frost
[8:51:29] <%geekjacob> okay we got the combo
[8:51:31] <rudiciuscaesar> @QueequegTheater OHHH ok, thank you.
[8:51:32] <$OfficerMods> barricade's animation is purely for show, it can activate frame 1
[8:51:33] <RubberFistFight> Bleed is absolutely the best option by far
[8:51:34] <Sigma_190_Beta> She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella.
[8:51:35] <taylorpony> just need to be bigger!
[8:51:37] <%luftraumm1> UGS for mimic???
[8:51:39] <+hybridfusio> DRIP SET
[8:51:40] <taylorpony> golder!
[8:51:43] <RubberFistFight> consider your hits lost, rely on the proc for damage
[8:51:48] <MikeCosimano> Big Huge
[8:51:50] <blue8moon> will the gold skeleton distract her?
[8:51:55] <+blitz31295> paiges weakness, not malenias
[8:51:57] <+MarkoTolstov> i had a FP regen item on my hohtbar and my mimic WOULD NOT STOP using it over and over, it was infuriating LUL
[8:52:03] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt if you have that seal of mohg, whatever it is, it increases your attack power if someone procs bleed near you.
[8:52:10] <+swesterly> get the dodges down and you'll be fine, blocking is for melvins
[8:52:17] <rudiciuscaesar> Hmmm, this boss is a ginger....
[8:52:20] <NewWillinium> I was using the Mirror Shield and a Cold Naginata. Which natively has bleed on it, though I swear that it never procs.  I mainly used the Naginata because it has a entirely unique moveset
[8:52:25] <+Romuken> im lvl 45 and need a place to get like 10k souls, any tips?  Almost made it but i found a fallingstar beast lol
[8:52:56] <NewWillinium> @Romuken 10K? Just go to Stormveil and farm some Giants.
[8:53:09] <@QueequegTheater> @Romuken Look up Vaati's recent video about how to get swole early
[8:53:10] <James_Quivers> Imagine this fight is she actually had some poise, oy vey
[8:53:13] <%dekkitout> Greg gives no quarter
[8:53:22] <NewWillinium> Or Beast Sanctum and kill the Milita men for easy 1k souls each
[8:53:27] <%justcallmebobplease> I look away for a minute - why is he repeating 'gold skeleton'?
[8:53:27] <djblue_shift> this might work, it IS paige's weakness
[8:53:28] <+Romuken> Thank you both!
[8:53:29] <D4N5T3P> @Romuken you can farm little dudes near bestial sanctum in caelid
[8:53:31] <@QueequegTheater> We thought Tiche was the protag, but she was just the Vegeta
[8:53:33] <+AyupaPupa> gold skeleton
[8:53:41] <%twohitgood> can't finish phase 1 on a crit
[8:53:42] <%justcallmebobplease> Is this his power mantra?
[8:53:50] <%VHGS> gold skeleton!
[8:53:50] <Lulu19> the dmg
[8:53:50] <+Romuken> Awesome, thanks!
[8:53:54] <+blitz31295> man, if this is the run i dont know if i should be proud or annoyed, GOLD SKELETON

[8:53:58] <%dekkitout> What ya gonna do when Skullmageddon runs wild
[8:54:08] <cavefishes> just keep rollin back there
[8:54:09] <+AlecBaldwinsTriggaFinger> Mimic is such a stupid mechanic in this game
[8:54:11] <+swesterly> the side sprint dodge the dive but you have to unlock and roll away from the bomb
[8:54:16] <Lulu19> uses rykards weapon ashe when shes in the flower
[8:54:16] <rudiciuscaesar> that red shockwave attack caused a knockdown on her old form, would it effect her the same way here?
[8:54:21] <@QueequegTheater> @AlecBaldwinsTriggaFinger Why
[8:54:31] <+TheBitingIrish> She has armor on, she's poiseless! GET HER! doodCrazy
[8:54:36] <thesaverofhumens> KomodoHype
[8:54:41] <halfmasks> YEAH GREG GET HER
[8:54:42] <+TheBitingIrish> has no armor on*
[8:54:43] <cavefishes> nah mimic is cool as shit
[8:54:49] <NewWillinium> Are there any Greatswords that have better Critical Damage?
[8:54:51] <Lulu19> get her
[8:54:52] <+5Two> Don't give up, Gold Skeleton!
[8:54:54] <Zap_Rowsdower32> Don't get greedy now
[8:54:55] <+AyupaPupa> GET HER
[8:54:59] <+swesterly> that attack where she thrusts down into aoe is great you can punish it hard
[8:54:59] <NewWillinium> YOU CAN BLOCK THAT SHIT?!

[8:57:20] <+AlecBaldwinsTriggaFinger> @it_came_from_outer_space It trivializes all bosses.
[8:57:22] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> item
[8:57:23] <+Nomenanza> Usable not key
[8:57:26] <@QueequegTheater> @AlecBaldwinsTriggaFinger Then don't use it

[8:57:31] <+Smokebanshee> consumable
[8:57:32] <RubberFistFight> YOU NOW HAVE THE ESCAPE CLAUSE FOR THE FRENZIED FLAME ENDING, MEANING IT'S SAFE TO GO BEHIND THE DOOR.

[8:57:53] <HeroToxiko> @AlecBaldwinsTriggaFinger You can't Stando the mimick?
[8:57:59] <rosabellamelantha> don't do frenzy flame still
[8:57:59] <@QueequegTheater> @AlecBaldwinsTriggaFinger Then there's no problem for you, why does it matter
[8:58:04] <Devbob98> Pat streaming hard tonight I see
[8:58:08] <TwistParabola> nods
[8:58:11] <RyuuAoi> Thought Pat would beat it in two weeks. He beat it in one. Cheers
[8:58:12] <tanarath> Rip
[8:58:13] <Sigma_190_Beta> You also got another Slab.
[8:58:14] <Lulu19> only useful if youve met 3 fingers
[8:58:15] <Midnight188> ok so this is how you Unbecome Lord of Frenzied Flame
[8:58:16] <+RushUnplugged> @AlecBaldwinsTriggaFinger bro you're so cool, let me suck your dick
[8:58:16] <tolloponik> wow you have to EARN un fucking up the ending
[8:58:20] <thesaverofhumens> we bloodborne now
[8:58:21] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt the rot is a god
[8:58:23] <it_came_from_outer_space> @AlecBaldwinsTriggaFinger Why does that matter?? its a videogame and not a movie. You can make your own choices and play it how you want to play it so the existence of powerful stuff doesnt matter to you
[8:58:24] <Evendrag> its how to "save" your maiden
[8:58:24] <sothatsprettybrutal> ending item? feels endingish
[8:58:26] <RustyQuarters> We Bloodborne now
[8:58:29] <+5Two> Aliens?
[8:58:29] <Zebroneath> Three fingers
[8:58:29] <%dcentii> There be outergods, like the god of rot and maybe god of the moon we don't know
[8:58:29] <+wizard_of_diamonds> There are WAY more gods out there then the one(s) on earth
[8:58:30] <+Tredecian> she used her rot to fuck up radhn and it fucked her up too
[8:58:30] <TwistParabola> OUTER GODS
[8:58:30] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt remember where you found the gold needle originally
[8:58:30] <$OfficerMods> was the space bugs not a hint enough?
[8:58:30] <%Niney_Who> @PatStaresAt Look up at those fucking Tree roots my dude there's a WOMAN
[8:58:31] <halfmasks> DONT FORGET THE OUTER GODS THAT LOVE BLOOD
[8:58:32] <%ScreamLord> Yog-Sothoth is in this?
[8:58:32] <whimwhisp> space~
[8:58:32] <no123450n> the meddling of DLC gods??
[8:58:33] <cavefishes> the greater will
[8:58:33] <Gorgs7> OUTER gods!?!?
[8:58:34] <TheBlankAce> You know you got the inner gods and outer gods
[8:58:35] <RustyQuarters> @thesaverofhumens eyyy
[8:58:36] <%sporeian94> THIS IS JUST BLOODBORNE 2
[8:58:38] <%tetraes> check her boss items
[8:58:39] <+Nomenanza> I think that is because she didnt die from rot. But they still bloom into these rot flowers from within I guess?
[8:58:39] <TheSandmanIsHere> Given you went with faith, go check out the incantation her remembrance gives you
[8:58:41] <TwistParabola> you can go get her sword now btw
[8:58:43] <digaogrunge> space rot
[8:58:45] <AtisutoCurry> BLOODBORNE??
[8:58:46] <%jamsbybetty> space herpies
[8:58:48] <NewWillinium> We wanna check out her gear at the Finger Reader to close out the night?
[8:58:48] <@QueequegTheater> Oh god, ALIEN AIDS
[8:58:49] <+sashagreenspiderqueen> outer gods would be i think the three fingers
[8:58:49] <thesaverofhumens> elden ring confirmed prequel to BB
[8:58:49] <penitentpendant> Milenia: "I Was Holding Them Back"
[8:58:51] <%ScreamLord> Time too fight fucking Azathoth
[8:58:51] <TwistParabola> oh check her Great Rune too
[8:58:53] <tanarath> Man, Ranni's sounding like a better and better option.
[8:58:54] <James_Quivers> Mohg got his powers from an outer god
[8:58:55] <%dcentii> there might be a blood outer god, rot outer god, moon outer god and otheres
[8:58:57] <%Kiiper> @Niney_Who He saw
[8:58:57] <Gimplock> Vati is going to have alot to do after this game
[8:58:58] <TheSandmanIsHere> where do you activate her rune?
[8:59:02] <perfectharbinger> Check out her rune. It's a good one.
[8:59:02] <%dekkitout> Do the Fromsoft games just have a casual interconnected cosmic war going on in the background of all the games?
[8:59:03] <+theoldone001> So wait, I did Ranni's quest, do I need to finish this quest to unfuck the ending?
[8:59:05] <+sashagreenspiderqueen> frenzied flame being "eldritch truth" that drives you mad to witness i think
[8:59:05] <halfmasks> @PatStaresAt Dont forget Mohg's sick blood powers are from the Outer Gods
[8:59:08] <%Monkeyweed21> An Empyrean is just someone who can serve as a vessel for an outer god, Malenia is the vessel of scarlet rot
[8:59:13] <+Smokebanshee> @sashagreenspiderqueen It's a bunch of things, there's multiple
[8:59:15] <NewWillinium> @TheSandmanIsHere Isolated Divine Tower I think
[8:59:15] <+AlecBaldwinsTriggaFinger> @it_came_from_outer_space Being powerful and trivializing something are two different things.
[8:59:17] <+swesterly> her rune gives you rally
[8:59:18] <+Nomenanza> GOLD SKELETON
[8:59:18] <%Niney_Who> Look up at the Roots
[8:59:19] <+AyupaPupa> gold skeleton
[8:59:20] <%DashXero> Gold. Skeleton.
[8:59:27] <sirrice77> @theoldone001 what do you mean unfuck? Did you do the frenzy quest too?
[8:59:30] <+wizard_of_diamonds> #FuckGowry
[8:59:30] <%ScreamLord> "Formless" Seals like the Dragon Communion Seal are weightless
[8:59:33] <TheSandmanIsHere> @theoldone001 no, frenzied flame is different from Ranni's ending
[8:59:36] <%Pookiedaexzile> Pat went full Goldar
[8:59:37] <$OfficerMods> you killed her
[8:59:41] <boostergoldz> you have to go back to the place you pick up the sun princess ring equivalent
[8:59:42] <+Nomenanza> nah she is there, you can see her face a bit
[8:59:42] <%Monkeyweed21> TRUSSY
[8:59:43] <+LandOfTheWay> the rot might be a cursed offshoot of the greater will, but i think it's more likely the power is an outer god itself
[8:59:43] <%dcentii> ye basically empyreans just have the power to taker over marikas place and become gods themselves
[8:59:43] <+Rofiarf> shes still there
[8:59:44] <%Niney_Who> Lady gone
[8:59:45] <TheSinner42> shes there still
[8:59:46] <@QueequegTheater> F
[8:59:46] <%DashXero> Oh she there.
[8:59:46] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt the lady degrades after the fight
[8:59:47] <Zebroneath> it's Miquella, the boy
[8:59:49] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> she is right there
[8:59:49] <cavefishes> @theoldone001 if you also did the freziedd flame quest yeah
[8:59:53] <$OfficerMods> oh there she is
[8:59:54] <rudiciuscaesar> @Pookiedaexzile Yeah, Goldarrr
[8:59:56] <%Pookiedaexzile> Finna fuck around Attack some teenagers with attitude
[8:59:57] <%Niney_Who> Oh yeah no she's there
[8:59:58] <%DashXero> She was right there!
[8:59:59] <it_came_from_outer_space> @AlecBaldwinsTriggaFinger I will reiterate. Why does it matter to /you/ that the /option/ to trivialize stuff existss
[8:59:59] <$SGrim> rooBlind
[9:00:00] <%moondog_> you can still see her face. it's WAAAAAY up there
[9:00:01] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> WAit he won? I missed it?!
[9:00:04] <+swesterly> nah she is still there
[9:00:04] <boostergoldz> which is through a trap chest warp in limgrave
[9:00:05] <%imthewisejanitor> Back up and to the lest.
[9:00:06] <@QueequegTheater> @AlecBaldwinsTriggaFinger If you don't use it, it doesn't matter
[9:00:08] <%imthewisejanitor> left*
[9:00:11] <NewWillinium> So. . . If this is the source of the Rot. . .the fucks with that giant lake of it? Why is this place so pretty by comparison?
[9:00:11] <Sigma_190_Beta> @PatStaresAt It's Miquella, not a lady.
[9:00:12] <+theoldone001> I wanted Ranni's ending, I'm in Azula right now. Just wanted to make sure before the end.
[9:00:14] <TheBlankAce> Its the former body of Miquella, there's a cavity where the cocoon used to be
[9:00:20] <Lulu19> bloodborne rune
[9:00:26] <%dekkitout> @TurtlesAndTentacles You shoulda saw it, Greg's number got so huge
[9:00:29] <TwistParabola> yeaaah
[9:00:30] <@QueequegTheater> @theoldone001 As long as you got the wedding ring you're fine
[9:00:30] <Evendrag> remember how to get there right?
[9:00:34] <Zebroneath> And Mohg took him out
[9:00:37] <%DashXero> So... What's the point of cashing in runes? I haven't been doing it.
[9:00:38] <+Nomenanza> Yeah Mhog ripped Miquella out of that shit
[9:00:42] <sirrice77> @theoldone001 if you did rannis ending, and didn't lock into the frenzy ending then you're fine. Just look for her sign after the final boss
[9:00:45] <+Nomenanza> While Melenia was sleeping I guess?
[9:00:46] <%BlueLunecy> Mohg ruins everything
[9:00:48] <%boggsz12> gold skeleton

[9:01:44] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt thoughts on Malenia's boss fight? Is it as bad as people were making it out to be or do you feel its an appropriate challenge for the superboss?
[9:01:49] <%dekkitout> Gold Skeleton, aka Daniel Elden Ring. This is essential lore
[9:01:57] <%Fenrisulfr_V> Make sure to look East from the top of the tower @PatStaresAt
[9:01:57] <%strakillias> Friendship ended with Disc Room, Gold Skeleton is my new best friend
[9:01:58] <+Tredecian> keep looking
[9:01:59] <Akett> Goldar and Rito having done a fusion dance.
[9:02:01] <+Nomenanza> @boggsz12 oooh where do you get that?
[9:02:05] <RickyRelucent> ahh, he made it
[9:02:07] <TwistParabola> yup
[9:02:07] <Lulu19> See that mountain over there?
[9:02:08] <RyuuAoi> It's ALL yours, Pat
[9:02:11] <RickyRelucent> now whats this
[9:02:15] <thesaverofhumens> Finger, but hole?
[9:02:15] <+SpiritoftheBat> !uptime
[9:02:15] <@Moobot> @SpiritoftheBat I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 9h 2m.
[9:02:21] <STORMWIZARD1> To bad u did not get her sword, Or did u?
[9:02:23] <boostergoldz> rally time
[9:02:26] <Zebroneath> Makes shield play very frustrating
[9:02:26] <deviljhojho_> finger but hole
[9:02:26] <pi_in_the_sci> The fuck is that over there?
[9:02:29] <%Cozy90> Woolie will love her
[9:02:30] <James_Quivers> BECOME BLOODBORNE
[9:02:31] <%LaughingCatt> so did you like Bloodborne?
[9:02:32] <RickyRelucent> looks like priscilla's place
[9:02:34] <%echobee_tv> Doesn't help when you use shield half the game too...them heals are nuts.
[9:02:36] <NewWillinium> You can get her sword at the Finger-Reader
[9:02:37] <$OfficerMods> now its YOUR bullshit mechanic
[9:02:42] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> You can now play bloodborne
[9:02:43] <deviljhojho_> finally, bloodborne
[9:02:44] <%echobee_tv> BLOODBORNE
[9:02:45] <%boggsz12> @Nomenanza aurizia hero's grave, outside leyndel
[9:02:46] <Lulu19> bloodborne rune
[9:02:46] <@QueequegTheater> It basically tells sword and board to go fuck itself, unfortunately
[9:02:46] <+Rofiarf> bloodborne
[9:02:46] <+Tredecian> immidiatly
[9:02:46] <%dekkitout> For the hijinks the game lets you do, that boss makes sense to be what it is
[9:02:47] <RickyRelucent> the bloodborne rune
[9:02:48] <%fanciful_fright> ITS JUST RALLY
[9:02:48] <%Niney_Who> BLOODBORNE RUNE
[9:02:48] <%Agami23> bloodborne rune
[9:02:48] <+Nomenanza> flask go down but shittier BB rally go up
[9:02:48] <%twohitgood> it's rally!
[9:02:49] <%pabloelenano2> bloodborn rune
[9:02:49] <Zebroneath> just Bloodborne
[9:02:49] <penitentpendant> Become Bloodborne
[9:02:50] <%ScreamLord> Bloodborne
[9:02:50] <thesaverofhumens> bloodborne mode
[9:02:51] <%discoinfierno> lmao
[9:02:52] <AtisutoCurry> FINALLY BLOODBORNE
[9:02:53] <%Monkeyweed21> BLOODBORNE
[9:02:53] <%Kiiper> Turns Estus in vials and gives you rally
[9:02:53] <$Emperor_Machinus> so bloodborne?
[9:02:54] <halfmasks> DA BLOODBORNE
[9:02:55] <it_came_from_outer_space> makes you bloodborne
[9:02:55] <$sarah_galb> regain from bloodbrone
[9:02:58] <some_brave_apollo> the only change i would make to her boss is let the player hit her out of the air before she does the flurry attack
[9:02:59] <tolloponik> bloodborne mode engaded!!
[9:03:03] <%dekkitout> Wus dat smel?
[9:03:04] <%Kiiper> Bad
[9:03:05] <+ipaintwithcolor> The heal is fine. The big issue is the flurry, it’s pure RNG.
[9:03:05] <$OfficerMods> pretty good
[9:03:05] <RubberFistFight> i think there's some slight tuning issues, and i think it's unfortunately a boss that demands narrow approaches- most people seem to be succeeding with either rot, bleed or frost - meaning a stackable debuff that deals a shit-ton of damage, whilst the hits that caused it get healed from.
[9:03:05] <+Nomenanza> @boggsz12 oh thanks, I thought I did that, guess not
[9:03:06] <sothatsprettybrutal> even then you only get Bloodborne and not her totally busted full regain
[9:03:07] <rudiciuscaesar> Bloodborne Skeleton?
[9:03:08] <%CopperTucker> Bloodborne 2 is the real Eldin Ring
[9:03:08] <+AyupaPupa> bloodborne from bloodborne series
[9:03:09] <%tetraes> Her boss item lore is cray
[9:03:09] <+swesterly> it's fucking great for dex builds
[9:03:09] <TwistParabola> bloodborne poggers
[9:03:10] <deviljhojho_> eh
[9:03:10] <$sarah_galb> its just regain
[9:03:11] <+Rofiarf> i didn't use it lol
[9:03:11] <+SaintSalted> other very lmao
[9:03:12] <+Nomenanza> awful
[9:03:12] <Sigma_190_Beta> @PatStaresAt It's Rally. I like it.
[9:03:13] <Kinteka> Not that good
[9:03:13] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> pretty decent
[9:03:14] <%dcentii> not as good as 40 free levels
[9:03:14] <+RushUnplugged> goodbad
[9:03:15] <RickyRelucent> it needs to be rly goodto replace the 15% dmg
[9:03:16] <+RushUnplugged> badgood
[9:03:18] <%strakillias> To the Giants testing center
[9:03:19] <@QueequegTheater> bood
[9:03:19] <halfmasks> WUZ DAT SMELL
[9:03:19] <%Agami23> i like that you can see some crazy stuff in the distance
[9:03:19] <RickyRelucent> REDUCED
[9:03:21] <NewWillinium> Don't know! I never turned off the Attribute Rune
[9:03:21] <TwistParabola> dunno
[9:03:21] <Lulu19> first one is stll the best
[9:03:23] <%Aeoneth> yeah it's a very short time frame for rallying
[9:03:23] <Evendrag> its "ok"
[9:03:24] <perfectharbinger> It's pretty good.
[9:03:26] <Lulu19> godrick
[9:03:27] <TheSandmanIsHere> DLC presumably will let you get the last few off Miquella and Godwyn to finish your collection
[9:03:27] <oda_flobunaga> You can hit her out of the air with status PRoccs so its not busted
[9:03:31] <LittleBigQuebec> if you use her katan its even better
[9:03:32] <Kinteka> You need to use a heavy weapon to get the most out of it
[9:03:32] <rudiciuscaesar> Beasts all over the shop.
[9:03:37] <%boggsz12> @Nomenanza it's hidden in there, you may have just missed it, i did at first
[9:03:39] <%xcompleasedad> Do you remember how to play Bloodborne? @PatStaresAt
[9:03:41] <+Nomenanza> I am once again just baffled how good Godrik's rune is
[9:03:42] <%Kiiper> It's really short for how much you get knocked down in this game
[9:03:43] <%dcentii> Godrick/Morgott still prob the best runes in the game
[9:03:45] <lilmac64> Build dependent.
[9:03:46] <+swesterly> that rune let's you face tank as dex
[9:03:46] <TwistParabola> the katanaaaaa
[9:03:49] <%Aeoneth> My dual longsword Quality build only had time for like 2 hits to regen off
[9:03:53] <deviljhojho_> now THIS is a weapon
[9:03:53] <%fanciful_fright> @TheSandmanIsHere Mohg's rune IS Miquella's rune
[9:03:56] <megaman_sentinel> what's that smell
[9:04:08] <%vexion_smh> become sephiroth
[9:04:08] <%twohitgood> or both
[9:04:09] <%barrakuta371> 48 dex!
[9:04:09] <RyuuAoi> USE IT
[9:04:09] <%dekkitout> Unique Skill: Duck Dance
[9:04:09] <@QueequegTheater> They have now
[9:04:11] <rudiciuscaesar> that is a fucking cool spell
[9:04:15] <%boggsz12> @Nomenanza wait nvm you get it for destroying the chariots
[9:04:15] <+Nomenanza> Aeonia is good but has HUGE recovery frames
[9:04:16] <%Niney_Who> Oh
[9:04:17] <%EldritchBee> Get that fucking sword pat
[9:04:17] <Lulu19> 3 slots
[9:04:17] <%echobee_tv> That sounds fun
[9:04:18] <%Niney_Who> So did you just
[9:04:18] <deviljhojho_> hmm, the best dex weapon in the game or a bad incantation
[9:04:19] <NewWillinium> . . That sounds cruel as fuck
[9:04:20] <RyuuAoi> Blade
[9:04:20] <%Agami23> her weapon is probably the best in the game from what i've seen
[9:04:22] <deviljhojho_> oh
[9:04:23] <%Niney_Who> Kill her into being a Goddess
[9:04:23] <+RushUnplugged> honestly the spell is way too slow
[9:04:24] <$SGrim> 3 slots rooPog
[9:04:25] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> It sucks but is so stylish so it balance itself out
[9:04:29] <+imthinkingdarbys> i want that katana, fighting malenia, not so much
[9:04:30] <%EldritchBee> WHA
[9:04:33] <Lulu19> kinda ASS

[9:04:40] <TheBlankAce> There's plenty of dupe places
[9:04:41] <%dcentii> yo nothing in this game is built around taking the waterfowl weapon art damage, it just melts everything
[9:04:44] <sothatsprettybrutal> he can double it
[9:04:46] <sothatsprettybrutal> it's fine
[9:04:46] <+zaddyforever> IMMEDIATE CHOICE
[9:04:47] <IntrepidEye> the spell looks fucking cool but has a half hour charge time

[9:05:59] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt looks really cool but the animation lock is death unfortunately
[9:06:01] <rudiciuscaesar> I think the color really adds to it, like if it was blue or green, it wouldn't be nearly as cool
[9:06:05] <sirrice77> @HeroToxiko can you clarify your question?
[9:06:07] <+Nomenanza> oh god that poor giant is getting fucked all the time
[9:06:08] <RyuuAoi> Yes ma Lord!

[9:06:37] <%EldritchBee> See
[9:06:37] <deviljhojho_> the sword is the best in the game tho
[9:06:38] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> but it is so stylish tho
[9:06:38] <TwistParabola> COMMIT
[9:06:43] <Lulu19> refund that shit
[9:06:45] <rudiciuscaesar> so it really needs to kill?
[9:06:51] <it_came_from_outer_space> Does it stagger human sized enemies?
[9:06:54] <%dcentii> the sword is  prob the best weapon in the game though
[9:06:54] <Evendrag> how invincible is it?
[9:06:55] <+Nomenanza> it also has a huge ass AoE
[9:06:55] <%dekkitout> Your health is very huge
[9:06:56] <James_Quivers> Use it with the free hit crystaltear
[9:07:00] <Sunstalker> Good finisher also good with summons
[9:07:02] <%DEETRz> your mimic can cast it too, can't he?
[9:07:07] <+swesterly> just respec twice
[9:07:07] <thesaverofhumens> what a foul outcome
[9:07:09] <sirrice77> @HeroToxiko Im not sure how it would?
[9:07:10] <tolloponik> we saw it enough times
[9:07:11] <+theoldone001> As a Dex build her sword is so fucking good
[9:07:12] <+swesterly> larval tears grow on trees
[9:07:16] <TwistParabola> use the Dexterity-Knot
[9:07:16] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Mondo props for winning against Malenia on 1st sitting
[9:07:20] <RyuuAoi> Fight the birds with the blade feet!
[9:07:22] <+Nomenanza> eh if it doesnt involve magic you can still see the moveset
[9:07:22] <tanarath> You should get dex up to 20 or 30 for the casting boost
[9:07:26] <+HuoShengdi> I think it will still play the animation
[9:07:28] <Lulu19> dex is for nerds
[9:07:29] <cavefishes> her weapon is so fucking cool
[9:07:30] <sothatsprettybrutal> @tolloponik brutal
[9:07:31] <deviljhojho_> can we power stance it
[9:07:31] <%CopperTucker> painted ashes, painted snow
[9:07:32] <RyuuAoi> That's sexy!
[9:07:33] <rudiciuscaesar> oh so this is what my friend meant by "I got a Sephiroth sword"
[9:07:36] <HeroToxiko> @HeroToxiko im asking if he wants to know she is dead or if it would make him sad
[9:07:36] <%vexion_smh> WOW
[9:07:36] <cavefishes> the weapon art is crazy
[9:07:37] <Khester824> Did pat beat Melania?
[9:07:38] <%Monkeyweed21> its the best pure dex weapon in the game
[9:07:41] <RickyRelucent> i like the shit version
[9:07:42] <%EldritchBee> It's still PRETTY good
[9:07:44] <RyuuAoi> Nice!
[9:07:44] <kulmoth> it just doesn't do any ddamage
[9:07:47] <%Kiiper> There's three steps
[9:07:49] <cavefishes> you get the airburst if you meet dex
[9:07:51] <%EldritchBee> @Khester824 He's using her weapon so
[9:07:52] <%pabloelenano2> yes this thing has octoslas
[9:07:52] <RickyRelucent> tiny murakumo
[9:07:54] <HeroToxiko> I saw that so many times when she invaded me
[9:07:56] <%greasypete00> thats just that one genichiro move thats so cool
[9:07:57] <+MarkoTolstov> it's pretty awesome and staggers like hell
[9:07:58] <sappinmahbinyot> you get the judgement cut if you have the dex
[9:07:58] <RickyRelucent> actual nodachi
[9:07:59] <%dcentii> @PatStaresAt that is prob top 2 weapon in the game
[9:07:59] <Evendrag> thats TIGHT
[9:08:05] <$OfficerMods> it is
[9:08:05] <RyuuAoi> NG+ with that, Pat
[9:08:06] <rudiciuscaesar> Pat's thinking about reallocating isn't he?
[9:08:07] <+Glidemusic> that sword is MOTIVATED
[9:08:08] <%Pookiedaexzile> No Hilt she held it raw
[9:08:08] <%Niney_Who> Yes
[9:08:10] <+RushUnplugged> it's up there
[9:08:11] <Sigma_190_Beta> @PatStaresAt You can do it up to three times.
[9:08:11] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> pretty much
[9:08:11] <NewWillinium> I would presume so
[9:08:11] <cavefishes> the damage is INSANE if you can land the full thing
[9:08:12] <RickyRelucent> wait nooooo
[9:08:15] <Varanoo> The waterfowl dance looks like what the fish dudes from sekiro did
[9:08:16] <Zebroneath> pretty much
[9:08:16] <cavefishes> yeah basiaclly
[9:08:17] <TwistParabola> it's up there.

[9:08:20] <%dekkitout> Watching a clip of the duck dance, looks neato
[9:08:21] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt this is why pure dex players were complaining because their best weapon is locked behind HER
[9:08:21] <RickyRelucent> washing pole! upgraded!
[9:08:22] <+LandOfTheWay> pretty much
[9:08:23] <%barrakuta371> for 48 dex it better be
[9:08:24] <thesaverofhumens> @Pookiedaexzile it was part of her robot arm
[9:08:24] <%luftraumm1> 48 woooff
[9:08:24] <%xcompleasedad> Bleed TOO
[9:08:24] <Khester824> If you have the stats you can do the anime lines
[9:08:25] <%strakillias> With that Dex cost it better be
[9:08:25] <%EldritchBee> It beat the game for me
[9:08:25] <digaogrunge> 48
[9:08:25] <%Kiiper> It's not as good as power stanced rapiers, but it has crazy damage on the L2
[9:08:26] <TheSandmanIsHere> how much more dex you need for it?
[9:08:26] <%dcentii> l2 spam
[9:08:27] <sirrice77> @HeroToxiko OH uh nah he just goes "Oh so that's how it is" like he does with anything else basically

[9:08:46] <%boggsz12> can't wait to get it, my dex character has been using the dismounter and bloodhound fang the whole game lmao
[9:08:46] <tanarath> Pat was used a katana in DS, so you know he'd be thinking about this.
[9:08:47] <HeroToxiko> @HeroToxiko nice
[9:08:48] <RyuuAoi> BIG COMBO

[9:09:02] <+LandOfTheWay> you can
[9:09:02] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt you can
[9:09:03] <TwistParabola> yeah
[9:09:03] <$OfficerMods> everyone wears it at high level
[9:09:05] <cavefishes> it's got some super armor but you can get hit out of it
[9:09:06] <RickyRelucent> i want her helmet, the wings look neat
[9:09:08] <NewWillinium> Her Helmet ended up being my mainstay for the rest of the game
[9:09:11] <+Edrem> if you activate a great rune can you get enough stats for the big attack?
[9:09:11] <+sashagreenspiderqueen> you can
[9:09:12] <Vermillion129> Loretta
[9:09:17] <cavefishes> i like her armor a lot
[9:09:17] <TwistParabola> also, talk to Gideon
[9:09:29] <@QueequegTheater> Gideon
[9:09:35] <cavefishes> at least the hat and dress
[9:09:36] <%EldritchBee> @Edrem It needs basically 50 dex, no way can he
[9:09:37] <deviljhojho_> you look like a cosplayer
[9:09:38] <%dcentii> @PatStaresAt if you have enough rebirth items I would just test it cause the sword is legit the coolest thing in the game
[9:09:38] <RickyRelucent> The armor kinda looks like "the dead" orc armor from shadow of war
[9:09:38] <thesaverofhumens> its light because dex
[9:09:39] <NewWillinium> Malenia's Helmet, and Mohg's robes. It's a GORGEOUS Combo
[9:09:40] <+sashagreenspiderqueen> the armor also shows to everyone that summons you that your dick is debilitatingly huge
[9:09:41] <Lulu19> nice dress
[9:09:41] <+HuoShengdi> malenia's helm is like the only way to give your char long hair
[9:09:44] <%Monkeyweed21> rub that shit in Gideons dumb face like a bitch
[9:09:44] <+swesterly> pairing the weapon art with her rune can let you tank through anything while dealing massive damage
[9:09:47] <James_Quivers> well yeah, she had like no poise, lol
[9:09:51] <$OfficerMods> horrifying
[9:09:52] <deviljhojho_> the hair too?
[9:09:52] <+Walopoh> lol cosplayer armor
[9:09:52] <%dekkitout> Not skeletal enough

[9:09:59] <+RushUnplugged> Patlenia
[9:10:01] <rudiciuscaesar> look at that man cleavage
[9:10:02] <%DEETRz> not a fan of the boots
[9:10:02] <AtisutoCurry> PAT WITH HAIR
[9:10:03] <RubberFistFight> oh pat you're stunning Kappa
[9:10:03] <TwistParabola> hmm
[9:10:04] <%luftraumm1> cosplay
[9:10:05] <+RealMichaelPhelps> would
[9:10:06] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Of course it's light. She's got, like, one real arm left.
[9:10:06] <@QueequegTheater> Neither gold enough nor skeletony enough
[9:10:07] <+Walopoh> did you STEAL her scalp?
[9:10:08] <Lulu19> it always is
[9:10:10] <%strakillias> Wait, the HAIR is part of the helmet?
[9:10:11] <%Monkeyweed21> TOE ARMOR
[9:10:13] <+sashagreenspiderqueen> the feet are the best touch
[9:10:13] <Gorgs7> Pat crossdress armor
[9:10:14] <RubberFistFight> you are the prettiest Pat-Tron at the rotten gala ball.
[9:10:14] <sirrice77> I don't like the color of the metal, doesn't work with anything
[9:10:15] <cavefishes> absolutely
[9:10:17] <%Pookiedaexzile> Play of Cos
[9:10:17] <tanarath> It's just Paige
[9:10:17] <%boggsz12> you and paige should co-op ng+ both with the outfit
[9:10:17] <digaogrunge> EVEN THE HAIR?
[9:10:21] <RyuuAoi> It's Old Pat! Ha
[9:10:23] <valstriam> This is the final form when Pat and Paige really become one person
[9:10:24] <$realm_forge> You’re the prettiest girl at the ball
[9:10:25] <%vexion_smh> Become as Paige
[9:10:29] <RickyRelucent> even the hair
[9:10:30] <%Monkeyweed21> that thigh gap tho
[9:10:31] <Vermillion129> the helmet having her hair is hilarious
[9:10:34] <%discoinfierno> The special edition has a statue of her so... they knew what they were doing
[9:10:39] <+Walopoh> did you cut off her hair? @PatStaresAt
[9:10:40] <%twohitgood> pait? peatches?
[9:10:41] <rudiciuscaesar> @Walopoh yeah, wait, wasn't she actually a ginger? After she exploded into butterfly mom or whatever, she had red hair, right?
[9:10:41] <sothatsprettybrutal> complete with vibram fivefingers
[9:10:42] <%dcentii> rebirth time to use op weapon
[9:10:50] <%Pookiedaexzile> Peach of Saliva
[9:10:52] <NewWillinium> That Helmet goes on everything I love it so much
[9:11:05] <rudiciuscaesar> no more Gold Skeleton?
[9:11:11] <rudiciuscaesar> just armored Akuma?
[9:11:13] <%dcentii> Abomination

[9:11:18] <deviljhojho_> now this is a set
[9:11:19] <+ScrapKingKeita> what's good old gideon gotta say
[9:11:23] <%Pookiedaexzile> Genghis Vibes
[9:11:26] <MicrotonalMatt> PatchesSalivatesAt
[9:11:27] <%X2Eliah> What a meme char
[9:11:31] <Sigma_190_Beta> I like it.
[9:11:32] <Lulu19> max set
[9:11:34] <RickyRelucent> i like the helmet, the hair mhm
[9:11:36] <RyuuAoi> Pat Saliva
[9:11:37] <%Pookiedaexzile> Finna Conquer the Steepe
[9:11:43] <halfmasks> GOLD SKELETON
[9:11:47] <Varanoo> Gold Skeleton looks so good
[9:11:48] <%dcentii> see how high you can upgrade that weapon
[9:11:49] <rudiciuscaesar> G O L D
[9:11:51] <RustyQuarters> I love the gold skeleton
[9:11:55] <Sigma_190_Beta> Not really.
[9:11:57] <RickyRelucent> don't give up, skeleton warrior
[9:12:00] <digaogrunge> HES THE HERO
[9:12:00] <%Kiiper> No
[9:12:00] <%dcentii> Time to be dex/faith
[9:12:00] <cinnamontography_> Does any one else feel Ganon vibes?
[9:12:01] <NewWillinium> The Hair actually sold me on it. Because it matched my character's hair color
[9:12:02] <%EldritchBee> Not buffable
[9:12:03] <Lulu19> gold skeleton is cool
[9:12:04] <cavefishes> nah
[9:12:07] <cavefishes> no
[9:12:08] <%Kiiper> It would be the best weapon in the game if it were
[9:12:14] <Lulu19> WE LOVE GOLD SKELETON
[9:12:15] <%EldritchBee> If you could bloodflame that shit it would be FUCKING BUSTED
[9:12:18] <%xcompleasedad> Bleed weapon, I think
[9:12:20] <cavefishes> real good dex scaling
[9:12:20] <Sunstalker> None of teh Somber stuff is
[9:12:24] <rudiciuscaesar> do it do bleed damage like most katanas though?
[9:12:24] <%Pookiedaexzile> Pat looks like he's about take on Bullet Club in the Tokyo Dome
[9:12:26] <%EldritchBee> It ALREADY does 55 bleed
[9:12:32] <%discoinfierno> @xcompleasedad it is yeah
[9:12:38] <%EldritchBee> @Sunstalker Some of it is, boss weapons are not
[9:12:40] <RickyRelucent> nice fit
[9:12:41] <cavefishes> like 3AR a level at +10 from 70-80 dex
[9:12:42] <RickyRelucent> : 3
[9:12:42] <%dcentii> dex faith yeye
[9:12:46] <tanarath> Wait, it's a bleed katana?
[9:12:49] <%boggsz12> have a nice night pat! congrats on beating the toughest challenge in the game!
[9:13:03] <%Monkeyweed21> rub that shit in Gideons face
[9:13:04] <%EldritchBee> @tanarath All katanas are bleed except for magic ones
[9:13:05] <tanarath> That's just dirty.
[9:13:05] <oda_flobunaga> Radagon's Soreseal
[9:13:07] <NewWillinium> There's a Soreseal that raises Dex but I'm not sure if you ahve that on or not
[9:13:08] <digaogrunge> Multi hit talisman
[9:13:08] <rudiciuscaesar> bleed seems real strong, so hopefully FromSoft doesn't nerf it
[9:13:10] <TheSandmanIsHere> successive attack boost stuff?
[9:13:11] <+swesterly> attack power bonus near bleed effects, attack power bonus with successive attacks
[9:13:12] <thesaverofhumens> the toughest challenge is putting the game down
[9:13:14] <RickyRelucent> all katana are bleed
[9:13:16] <RickyRelucent> shrug
[9:13:16] <halfmasks> @PatStaresAt the talisman that boosts consecutive hits
[9:13:17] <%luftraumm1> winged sword talisman
[9:13:25] <TwistParabola> Dexterity-Knot from your flask of wondrous physick
[9:13:31] <RickyRelucent> even the curved greatswords by dark souls 2
[9:13:38] <RickyRelucent> 3 forsure
[9:13:42] <Carlioo> rotten winged huh
[9:13:51] <%EldritchBee> That talisman procs on like, 2 hits it's busted
[9:13:55] <RickyRelucent> probably 3, i remember going big luck
[9:13:55] <tanarath> It makes rule-of-cool sense that they'd be bleed.
[9:13:55] <%Cozy90> rotten wing is fuckin HOT
[9:14:00] <%Pookiedaexzile> Now put the Great Sword in your other hand
[9:14:01] <Sunstalker> @EldritchBee I hate the bleed procc stats. Frostbite properly differs between weapons. Bleed? 55 for everything no matter how slow it is (except fists, who get even less)
[9:14:08] <Sigma_190_Beta> GOLDEN!
[9:14:09] <%justcallmebobplease> ...Has anyone Powerstanced Malenia's sword yet?
[9:14:09] <cavefishes> now get that respec, KING
[9:14:12] <halfmasks> GOLD SKELETON SAMURAI
[9:14:14] <%EldritchBee> GOLD KATANA SKELETON
[9:14:14] <RyuuAoi> So Pat beat ER! What will he LP next!? NotLikeThis
[9:14:23] <%dcentii> YEYE DEX/FAITH
[9:14:24] <deviljhojho_> do what
[9:14:24] <%EldritchBee> @justcallmebobplease Beat the game with that build, it was SICK
[9:14:26] <TheSandmanIsHere> chat with Gideon first
[9:14:26] <zenith0111> Theres so many cool weapons and moves in this game its insane
[9:14:33] <thesaverofhumens> @RyuuAoi its not over yet
[9:14:35] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> you should also use a katana on your other hand to proc both bleed and frost
[9:14:36] <rudiciuscaesar> wait?
[9:14:37] <NewWillinium> Okay but can you be MORE Gold though?
[9:14:38] <+wizard_of_diamonds> I'm waiting.
[9:14:40] <cavefishes> ...
[9:14:40] <TwistParabola> ?
[9:14:40] <%luftraumm1> oh you really doing this huh
[9:14:42] <digaogrunge> UPGRADE
[9:14:42] <halfmasks> JUST TRADE SOME HEALTH FOR DEX THO
[9:14:44] <%boggsz12> @EldritchBee most katanas get 30 don't they? Dismounter is broken though, you can upgrade that shit to 90
[9:14:44] <+MarkoTolstov> he's been converted into a dex user yeeesssss
[9:14:50] <+swesterly> you should have plenty of somber
[9:14:53] <RickyRelucent> if you go quality you'll probably use most firt run
[9:14:53] <rudiciuscaesar> hold onto our butts?
[9:14:56] <%dcentii> you got a +9 and +10 so you should be able to
[9:14:57] <RickyRelucent> first*
[9:15:05] <satiresatyr> hunters yassification
[9:15:08] <coziestbank> @EldritchBee Bleed AND Frostbite scale with arcane, the Int is only for regular attack damage, the status and weapon art are arcane.
[9:15:12] <+imthinkingdarbys> so my friend is playing this as his first from game and is deadset on staying with a thief starter. unsurprisingly it's not going well for him
[9:15:13] <%X2Eliah> Katanas have 50 (or was it 55) at base
[9:15:13] <@PrefectusCorgi> Dont forget to talk to Gideon
[9:15:34] <$OfficerMods> absolute mad man
[9:15:38] <+imthinkingdarbys> 45 base
[9:15:38] <NewWillinium> So I forgot to speak to Ofnir in my own game, and by watching your streams I've learned that he comments on your Demigod fights. Does he do that for all of them?
[9:15:48] <+swesterly> put on the fap ring
[9:15:53] <rudiciuscaesar> Gold Skeleton too heavy?
[9:15:56] <@QueequegTheater> @NewWillinium yes
[9:16:01] <%X2Eliah> ok 45 base and probably most ppl have enough base arcane to get to around 50
[9:16:04] <%dcentii> @PatStaresAt you can put like a point in end during respec
[9:16:05] <+Based_Moose> Is Pat about to beat the game?
[9:16:09] <+GilroyGoldBlood> that works
[9:16:12] <%discoinfierno> too much drip, please nerf
[9:16:13] <TheSandmanIsHere> what does Gideon have to say about her death?
[9:16:16] <NewWillinium> Man I missed so much content then
[9:16:17] <cavefishes> works
[9:16:19] <thesaverofhumens> DeS boys
[9:16:19] <+RushUnplugged> GOLD SKELETON
[9:16:19] <+GilroyGoldBlood> @Based_Moose still got a bit to go
[9:16:19] <%X2Eliah> pat has already beaten the game
[9:16:23] <%X2Eliah> this is all just optional
[9:16:23] <megaman_sentinel> holy s*** 170
[9:16:23] <%boggsz12> @X2Eliah oh i'm mixing this game up with the katanas in ds3, my bad
[9:16:24] <halfmasks> GOLD SKELETON SAMURAI OF THE LORD
[9:16:26] <rudiciuscaesar> man, that is a pavise for sure
[9:16:28] <RickyRelucent> can't stress tiny stuff
[9:16:31] <%dekkitout> If anything you're more gold
[9:16:31] <oda_flobunaga> Pat's got at least 1 super long stream to go to beat the game
[9:16:32] <RickyRelucent> light is a big factor
[9:16:32] <$OfficerMods> aw now your livery is all silvery
[9:16:32] <sirrice77> @Based_Moose he probably will in 1-2 streams
[9:16:34] <%vexion_smh> PatDripsAt

[9:17:44] <%Ynkubus_> Yorkshire accent
[9:17:47] <%dcentii> it decrease holy damage by a lot
[9:17:47] <%Pookiedaexzile> his accent is KING OF NORF
[9:17:49] <Evendrag> the all knowing
[9:17:53] <sothatsprettybrutal> good for when you attack and dethrone god
[9:17:54] <James_Quivers> @PatStaresAt Ask about the medalions to him, it's a different talk option this time

[9:21:21] <Strigiform> you can do 11 str and still 2 hand 16 str weapon
[9:21:24] <%dcentii> put the rest in dex that sword scale good
[9:21:28] <rudiciuscaesar> @RubberFistFight thank you.
[9:21:30] <cavefishes> dex is good up to like 80 with this weapon
[9:21:37] <%EldritchBee> You want that HP pat
[9:21:37] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Softcap is 80 for DEX
[9:21:49] <cavefishes> i get +3 per level from 70-80
[9:21:51] <Omenaire_> does dex make incants faster?
[9:21:55] <TwistParabola> HP for sure
[9:21:59] <TheQuadrupleS> Pat gave up on strength?
[9:22:01] <+swesterly> what is the plan?
[9:22:04] <+swesterly> two handing only?
[9:22:05] <+RushUnplugged> pat pls, vigor
[9:22:10] <tanarath> @omenaire_ it makes all casts faster
[9:22:17] <rudiciuscaesar> wait, sacrifice all of the strength?
[9:22:24] <TwistParabola> he's gonna die in like two hits
[9:22:26] <NewWillinium> That Vigor hurts me knowing what comes next
[9:22:29] <@QueequegTheater> @rudiciuscaesar Yes, we are katana skeleton now
[9:22:30] <%dcentii> @PatStaresAt you can also put it at 75 and use Godricks rune
[9:22:30] <%dasmause> why is your R armament not gaining any damage?
[9:22:32] <halfmasks> PAT YOU MADMAN
[9:22:33] <%Pookiedaexzile> Vig Dump
[9:22:37] <+ReallyBigRocks> just don't get hit
[9:22:37] <RyuuAoi> No more faith?
[9:22:45] <%Kiiper> 16 str
[9:22:48] <%dekkitout> Oh, you're not for real about this, you're 5real
[9:22:49] <sirrice77> If anyone cares the guardian swordspear off of the tree guys with spears near erdtrees has the same moveset as lorettas
[9:22:52] <+swesterly> you aren't two handing either
[9:22:54] <cavefishes> 12 strength means you'd need to two hand
[9:22:55] <Gamer76255> Soreseal is 5 dex too
[9:22:57] <%EldritchBee> No, you put the items away
[9:22:58] <+swesterly> the damage will be shit
[9:23:03] <$realm_forge> Glass Cannon Greg
[9:23:07] <%dcentii> because you don't have the 16 strength so it doesn't count 2 hand
[9:23:09] <%EldritchBee> @sirrice77 IT DOES???
[9:23:15] <NewWillinium> Does anything have the same moveset as the Naginata you get?
[9:23:15] <%FunkyStreams> what is he respecing for?
[9:23:21] <+theoldone001> Need 16 Strength to use her sword
[9:23:26] <%dasmause> oh ok. im asking because apparently one of the katanas in the game is bugged and gets no scaling
[9:23:26] <zenith0111> @sirrice77 Isnt the Dex scaling A too?
[9:23:26] <NewWillinium> New Katana
[9:23:28] <%Kiiper> 16 strength
[9:23:34] <sirrice77> @sirrice77 exactly the same but doesnt have lorettas slash of course, you can use any other ash of war though
[9:23:37] <tanarath> He found a great katana he likes
[9:23:38] <halfmasks> @FunkyStreams Gold Skeleton Samurai of the Lord
[9:23:39] <+imthinkingdarbys> i think it's cuz you're one handing so you can't swing it
[9:23:42] <Sigma_190_Beta> 2 Handing Chat.
[9:23:43] <@QueequegTheater> You had FTH at 40
[9:23:44] <TheSandmanIsHere> 16 str apparently?
[9:23:44] <sirrice77> @zenith0111 goes up to A yes
[9:23:45] <%Felhad> @patstaresat 16str
[9:23:45] <%vexion_smh> 9 hours and a half stream PogChamp
[9:23:54] <Sigma_190_Beta> 2 Handing adds 5.5 Strength.
[9:23:56] <%dcentii> hes gonna 2 hand it so he's fine
[9:24:00] <Octopimp> 69 strength
[9:24:01] <tanarath> You need 11 str to 2h or 16 str to 1h it?
[9:24:02] <coziestbank> He only wants the shield effect
[9:24:04] <rudiciuscaesar> minimum for the katana?
[9:24:11] <sothatsprettybrutal> they're saying just because it explains why the damage number shows wrong
[9:24:17] <rudiciuscaesar> oh wait, yeah, two-hand
[9:24:20] <Vermillion129> what does that shield do btw
[9:24:24] <+swesterly> you get the heal while wearing it?
[9:24:25] <%justcallmebobplease> Does the shield's HP regen care if you have stat requirements?  That seems a concern with a Fromsoft game.
[9:24:30] <Ghufufin> try skill?
[9:24:32] <Vermillion129> oh adju shield
[9:24:32] <Omenaire_> passively?
[9:24:34] <RyuuAoi> Fashion shield, guys. Chill
[9:24:34] <digaogrunge> You will cast something and forget and fuck up, we know it Pat
[9:24:34] <coziestbank> and boosts rock sling
[9:24:38] <@QueequegTheater> @justcallmebobplease no
[9:24:38] <+imthinkingdarbys> but the number isn't going up because its not effective with that low of strength
[9:24:39] <it_came_from_outer_space> circled all the way back to demon's souls builds
[9:24:43] <%dcentii> go hit a giant
[9:24:45] <rudiciuscaesar> oh is that the shield from Demon's Souls? At least an homage to it
[9:24:50] <+GilroyGoldBlood> Ah, I was wondering why it looked like the adjudicator shield. Makes sense
[9:24:50] <Octopimp> oh i never found that shield. neat!
[9:24:51] <TwistParabola> lmao
[9:24:55] <HeroToxiko> stares at calendar melting away to 2009
[9:24:55] <rudiciuscaesar> Wow, Pat really is a Gold Katana Skeleton now
[9:24:57] <thesaverofhumens> @rudiciuscaesar yeah
[9:24:57] <+MarkoTolstov> how do you know what the stat requirements are for two handing it?
[9:25:03] <%DEETRz> what shield is that? i dont think i ever found it
[9:25:10] <rudiciuscaesar> lmao Gold Katana Skeleton who self identifies as a tree?
[9:25:10] <+AyupaPupa> gold... skeleton?
[9:25:11] <cavefishes> tree cosplay mode
[9:25:15] <@QueequegTheater> @MarkoTolstov requirement * 2 / 3
[9:25:16] <TheSandmanIsHere> bring str up to 16 to see the actual damage, then lower it again before finalize
[9:25:18] <%dekkitout> We've come full circle, form hating trees to becoming tree
[9:25:20] <%luftraumm1> @patstaresat octopimp in chat, say hi
[9:25:20] <trixterDeVil> is this 1st playthrough? still on new game?
[9:25:20] <djblue_shift> don't you only need 75 dex with the soreseal?
[9:25:22] <+imthinkingdarbys> number go up
[9:25:23] <zenith0111> @justcallmebobplease Theres a clear trade off tho. Its a greatshields so heavy af and cant use it for blocking so its not busted
[9:25:25] <+swesterly> woah wait
[9:25:25] <@QueequegTheater> @MarkoTolstov then round up
[9:25:29] <+imthinkingdarbys> real big now
[9:25:31] <%soloshotfirst82> "Trees are basically rocks that move a tiny bit" - Pat, about 8 hours ago.
[9:25:31] <RickyRelucent> i'm thinking 60 is the softcap for most and 80 hardcap
[9:25:32] <Sigma_190_Beta> @MarkoTolstov We know the exact stats you gain for two handing. and it's 5.5 Str.
[9:25:33] <Octopimp> hey man! hope youre enjoying this game

[9:26:21] <%Call_Me_Deacon_Blues> Pat why arent you using the super Dragon Lighting Spear?
[9:26:22] <cavefishes> 16 str is probably nice for the 1 handing if you wanna shield
[9:26:22] <Octopimp> @cawi octoKnife
[9:26:26] <Evendrag> have*
[9:26:27] <%dekkitout> Health still looks massive
[9:26:33] <TheBlankAce> Doesn't the beast catalyst blow now since you killed strength
[9:26:36] <RyuuAoi> You'll get it all back, Pat. Next week you'll be capped.
[9:26:38] <%EldritchBee> @Evendrag No rot, it's busted enough already
[9:26:45] <djblue_shift> he doesn't need 16 with the soreseal, it's fine
[9:26:56] <Evendrag> @eldritchbee ok i see tstyNoise
[9:26:57] <Chrisboy265> Skeletor lookin ass
[9:26:57] <+GilroyGoldBlood> Your health is still great than mine. I beat the game at 35 vigor
[9:26:58] <+swesterly> there's a talisman that heals on successive attacks as well
[9:27:05] <+GilroyGoldBlood> greater*
[9:27:08] <NewWillinium> So what kind of damage are we looking at? 700s?
[9:27:17] <thesaverofhumens> how high do you plan to level up to @PatStaresAt
[9:27:25] <%Felhad> whoof, shield is only 3hp/s
[9:27:27] <$realm_forge> Gold katana skeleton build complete
[9:27:35] <masterp1e> are u gonna use the bloodborne great rune too?
[9:27:40] <halfmasks> @PatStaresAt doesnt your catalyst now suck cause your strength is now doodoo?
[9:27:45] <RickyRelucent> doot
[9:27:48] <rudiciuscaesar> Jesus that dude got deleted

[9:28:09] <TwistParabola> do it to them
[9:28:11] <TwistParabola> do the move
[9:28:13] <Chrisboy265> Thats rad
[9:28:14] <$OfficerMods> ANIMEEEEE
[9:28:16] <$sarah_galb> doesnt the skeleton mask give hp regen too ?
[9:28:16] <Vermillion129> LUL
[9:28:16] <+imthinkingdarbys> holy hell
[9:28:17] <thesaverofhumens> LUL
[9:28:17] <+GilroyGoldBlood> lmfao

[9:28:19] <@QueequegTheater> @dcentii much faster though
[9:28:20] <cavefishes> LMAO
[9:28:20] <%FunkyStreams> ...I see why he respeced
[9:28:22] <medril07> whoa
[9:28:24] <%JustToWatch> Don't you get HP from the mask though?
[9:28:30] <cavefishes> i fucking love this weapon
[9:28:30] <+GilroyGoldBlood> like ZERO fp cost too
[9:28:31] <+swesterly> evil eye talisman or heal on successive attacks pairs great here
[9:28:31] <RubberFistFight> HOLY SHIT I NEED THAT SWORD
[9:28:33] <%dcentii> 3 times l2
[9:28:34] <thesaverofhumens> downside is if you get hit when you're doing it you instantly flop
[9:28:37] <%dekkitout> Turbo weeb coming at ya
[9:28:39] <+Glidemusic> do all 3
[9:28:41] <oda_flobunaga> Skele mask only gives regen is hp critical
[9:28:43] <rudiciuscaesar> so 3 combos?
[9:28:47] <+imthinkingdarbys> these guys are not willing to test you
[9:28:48] <RyuuAoi> Ballin
[9:28:50] <cavefishes> just keep mashing basically
[9:28:55] <Vermillion129> I wonder if I should try duel wield hand of malenia and nagakiba
[9:29:02] <Chrisboy265> Pat can you convince Joel to keep streaming Elden Ring
[9:29:02] <cavefishes> yeee you get the air burst finish too
[9:29:02] <$realm_forge> GOLD. KATANA. SKELETON.
[9:29:03] <TheSandmanIsHere> it's beautiful
[9:29:06] <+cawi> a NPC invader did that to me during a quest before I saw that boss
[9:29:16] <cavefishes> it MELTS shit in NG+
[9:29:21] <%echobee_tv> You can sell runes to get them faster, right?
[9:29:22] <cavefishes> like one combo boss dead
[9:29:22] <+GilroyGoldBlood> @cawi yeah, Millicent does it
[9:29:26] <+swesterly> trading the physical dmg reduction for the other healing talismans is more optimal imo
[9:29:27] <%dcentii> 51 rune arcs lul
[9:29:35] <%Pookiedaexzile> Garo cosplay
[9:29:35] <halfmasks> @realm_forge FOR JESUS

[9:29:41] <%Monkeyweed21> why?
[9:29:42] <NewWillinium> Didn't some of your Faith spells also scale with Strength? Is that going to be an issue with your build going forard?
[9:29:45] <Sigma_190_Beta> You can also use your Boss Souls @PatStaresAt
[9:29:54] <%vexion_smh> so many runes PogChamp
[9:30:02] <+cawi> @cawi one of the giant jar NPCs did it to me.

[9:30:31] <Sigma_190_Beta> @swesterly They are, but he's not using them.
[9:30:33] <rudiciuscaesar> because they're a remembrance?
[9:30:34] <OBS_VinnieK> err but duplicate is limited
[9:30:37] <ysybusybear> mausoleums only dupe one rememberance per
[9:30:39] <%Pookiedaexzile> Acksually you just locked yourself out of a secret ending
[9:30:45] <Chrisboy265> I thought you could only duplicate them if you have them in your inventory?
[9:30:46] <@QueequegTheater> But what if you need them later tho Kappa
[9:30:49] <thesaverofhumens> you used one earlier to get the sword

[9:32:31] <coziestbank> jumps at the last level i think
[9:32:31] <cavefishes> yeah you need a knockdown or opening on big bosses
[9:32:33] <zenith0111> Dex chads
[9:32:43] <NewWillinium> It felt like most weapons only go to B Scaling
[9:32:47] <%Monkeyweed21> letters are lies remember
[9:32:55] <Sunstalker> Paige, tell him his dick only goes to B scaling D:
[9:32:56] <%vexion_smh> WTF
[9:32:58] <rudiciuscaesar> oh, if you get it, he cancels your recovery frames?
[9:33:12] <thesaverofhumens> @NewWillinium some str weapons go to S
[9:33:13] <%vexion_smh> oop
[9:33:13] <cavefishes> that spell is cool af but kinda trash to use cause the recovery is so long
[9:33:14] <RubberFistFight> fuck me, it hits big
[9:33:15] <NewWillinium> Man Scarlet rot is actually doing respectable tick damage
[9:33:15] <TheHotStuven> Panic rolls PogChamp
[9:33:16] <Strigiform> str gets s scaling stuff, but dex stuff has things like bleed
[9:33:19] <+imthinkingdarbys> apparently what we've learned is Death Rite Bird would've fucked Malenia up
[9:33:21] <+zaibatsu_member_333> onlyafroCry onlyafroCry onlyafroCry
[9:33:22] <%Felhad> @monkeyweed21 Letters arent lies, its just that they range, so a Low B is worse than a High B

[9:33:47] <bassoontyphoon> Goodnight!
[9:33:48] <digaogrunge> This is gonna need some adjustments to the playstyle
