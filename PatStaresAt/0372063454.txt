[0:17:26] <%Typhaeon> The good taste of RED BULL Kappa

[0:17:32] <+Nomicro4u> Chug redbull ever 30 minutes
[0:17:33] <scrumbotime> The Good Taste of Red Bull
[0:17:33] <AmericanaRed> RED BULL IS KING BlessRNG DrinkPurple
[0:17:35] <%Remery_> Red Bull loves Pat
[0:17:35] <%walternatorz> and that good taste is the taste of Diet Coke!
[0:17:35] <OwlLightningMage> Pat is dying inside of the Red Bulls
[0:17:36] <%konekoryugamine> Oh FINALLY my earbuds work for me! XD
[0:17:37] <deadredeyez> is this a red bull add

[0:17:37] <Youwereeatenbyalid> OOF
[0:17:38] <ebonifragaria> Paige in the room increases the shame level
[0:17:38] <matrignomy7> But Pat I thought you said to sell out all the time!
[0:17:39] <Novillion> LUL
[0:17:39] <@mothmandraws> oh thanks for the sub

[0:17:46] <$MajorCrasher> red bull tastes like crap though
[0:17:49] <ScreamingMeat> Where Screamo?
[0:17:51] <Youwereeatenbyalid> She's just standing there...MENACINGLY
[0:17:52] <+redstonej> IV Redbull directly into the bloodstream
[0:17:54] <+Emperor_Bad> pat isnt even a real sellout
[0:17:55] <deadredeyez> OhMyDog look out
[0:17:55] <%irziggo> judge him Paige
[0:17:56] <%Bailey__gaming> I live in England its a shit hole
[0:17:58] <the_sprankton> Pat says he doesn't want to be beholden to red bull, but would probably die from caffeine withdrawal if he quit
[0:17:59] <Giga_Wattz> The blueberry Red Bull is good
[0:18:03] <%ShaneWhite> Stand there and look down at Pat
[0:18:03] <%Ell1ot> i like the yellow red bull
[0:18:10] <AMajorTom> What if you could get 3 times the subscribers but you had to be a mouse and keyboard FPS man? What about 10 times?
[0:18:11] <%konekoryugamine> I've never been out of the country
[0:18:14] <invisi_bliss> you truly are the resident evil
[0:18:17] <ackshun_jacksun> LUL
[0:18:24] <+ShlickShlocks> I would prefer if RedBull were beholden to Pat
[0:18:25] <haisho> this still has some scripted scares with Mr X
[0:18:25] <%konekoryugamine> What about the dogs in the hall
[0:18:32] <lesbianmimikyu> @AngriestPat Piranha Plant is live with the new smash patch

[0:18:38] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> knock knock open up the door it's real
[0:18:40] <deadredeyez> they cant put colors next to red bull can they
[0:18:40] <%connos_livereview> the sherry ada sections are kinda tedious after the first time
[0:18:41] <CrimsonGargoyle> @ShlickShlocks truly the best timeline
[0:18:44] <+Nomicro4u> Hes just a bro
[0:18:45] <theInkShow> oh shit: Pat

[0:18:47] <%Ell1ot> i think Oven Man from RE4 is my favorite
[0:18:47] <HyperionXV> Have you heard about the FPS bug with knife damage that returned from RE7?
[0:18:48] <%nofestu2> OPEN UP THE DOOR
[0:18:49] <marvel877> Oven man in RE4 gets me every time, even though I know its coming.
[0:18:50] <%konekoryugamine> With the nonstop POP PO of stainless steel!
[0:18:51] <@mothmandraws> I wish there was a hardcore mode where they make him there all the time
[0:18:51] <Bouldus> @AngriestPat you hear about exodus getting pulled from the steam store and is only on the epic store now?
[0:18:52] <+Camail> familiarity destroys fear
[0:18:52] <%SilverDevilfish> Mr. X honestly gets annoying after the 3rd or so time
[0:18:53] <ert2112> that that bench circling gif

[0:19:15] <%konekoryugamine> Speaking for Woolie equals never good shit
[0:19:16] <%snow_bush> @AngriestPat How would you feel about replacing Mr. Xs footsteps with that song where it increases and decreases in volume to represent distance via mod?
[0:19:17] <%Laecerelius> Mr. X literally smashes through walls constantly
[0:19:25] <+Toblo1> @AngriestPat Getting chased by Mr X isn't scary. Getting *ambushed* by him is.
[0:19:26] <Ion_LaserX> Yup
[0:19:29] <%konekoryugamine> Screw the scaling no one cares.
[0:19:35] <FruitBasketVidya> Pat did you see the knife damage is tied to FPS?
[0:19:43] <%konekoryugamine> That's basically what;s become the point today
[0:19:45] <%sleepy_coffee> @psithen Capcom mentioned that if there was enough attention to Re2 Remake then they would think about doing an Re3 remake
[0:19:53] <%konekoryugamine> YES
[0:19:56] <%konekoryugamine> TEHRE NEEDS TO BE ONE
[0:20:02] <+psithen> plz capcom
[0:20:03] <%konekoryugamine> Imagine Nemesis looking badass in HD!
[0:20:07] <ScreamingMeat> @AngriestPat I love how politely Mr. X opens and closes doors, considering he can just tear them off the wall
[0:20:08] <+Yokuho> @AngriestPat Play with classic music and alt costumes, don't forget
[0:20:17] <%konekoryugamine> Yeah

[0:22:10] <%konekoryugamine> Bioshock is one of the best fucking games I have ever played damn it!
[0:22:10] <Finakala> KH is awful anyway
[0:22:14] <%ToxInjection> Bioshock CAN be spooky.
[0:22:15] <CalderGaming> bioshock with a Super big daddy pursuing you constantly would be interesting
[0:22:18] <%konekoryugamine> Anyone here who says Bioshock sucks can go SUCK IT
[0:22:24] <jj_cabo> TWO?!
[0:22:25] <CrazyGunMan100> KH is weird cuz i cant get over the fact that the world is ending then it just cutting to a shot of Goofy going 'Gorsh'
[0:22:29] <MyNameIsRasus> KH is so dumb. I love it.
[0:22:29] <%snow_bush> Chungas of unusual size
[0:22:30] <gustavozxd> cutscenes are awkward and badly paced in 3, and tangled world is literally shot for shot just the tangled movie where sora will SOMETIMES show up maybe
[0:22:32] <DonatelloJose> Bioshock is in my top 10
[0:22:32] <%Ell1ot> Pat, that soda is not a red bull. they're going to almost offer you a sponsor again

[0:22:38] <%ElenaManetta> Mickey stared deeply into Riku's eyes. "We have to save our friends from being consumed by the darkness!" he bellowed with tears in his eyes. Riku looked down and sighed. He thought about all the good memories he had with Sora and Kairi. Motivated, a twinkle appeared in Riku's eyes as he lifted his keyblade and shouted, "We must save our friends!!!"
[0:22:38] <+boomstickery> what is the scariest game ever? outlast has to eb up there
[0:22:40] <nobody12349> Hot Take: Kingdom Hearts is dumb and confusing fanfiction that got really popular.

[0:47:14] <neooneshin> Where is Jill?
[0:47:15] <Flamekidx> I don't like Claire's classic outfit here
[0:47:16] <preexitman> it just asked
[0:47:16] <%rumtumtugnutz> I wonder if VR gives Pat vertigo.
[0:47:19] <+Alig200> @The_Butterfly_Man it already is, its avaialble as an individual dlc on steam and ps4, dunno bout xbox one, but i assume so.
[0:47:20] <Futuretimetraveller> I prefer her leather jacket
[0:47:20] <%DirtyGaijin> What have they done to her classic?
[0:47:21] <%ToxInjection> OG Claire Kreygasm
[0:47:22] <fragdar> yo.. just got here.. how much i missed
[0:47:23] <majindusto> Terrible Claire "Nostalgia" costume

[0:47:26] <%Laecerelius> Woolie's on!
[0:47:27] <TheEnablerr> Those clothes do NOT look great
[0:47:28] <SociallyAwkwardToaster> Why isn't claire wearing her shirt underneath the jacket?
[0:47:28] <Desertfishing> Booty short Clair
[0:47:31] <@PlagueOfGripes> so the story is that Leon drives into a zombie war zone out of curiosity, then leaves
[0:47:31] <%sleepy_coffee> oh man that clasic claire costome looks odd, why no black shirt underneath her vest?
[0:47:31] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> So Claire is the one who popularized jumpers
[0:47:32] <GohanEgret> @fragdar just started the game
[0:47:33] <%walternatorz> cavalcade is a $5 word
[0:47:34] <Bouldus> was that MJ
[0:47:35] <%willjar313> Leon's life is all zambambos, all the time.
[0:47:36] <%connos_livereview> It needs the black tee badly
[0:47:39] <fragdar> nice
[0:47:39] <%joylent_blue> its not an actual classic outift if Claire's hair doesn't look like dog poop
[0:47:40] <Nighthawkmun> Such a pretty man
[0:47:42] <TheEnablerr> then again, it IS the 90's
[0:47:45] <dukenux> Lacks black tee
[0:47:46] <+Nomicro4u> who said taht

[0:49:13] <jacksawjack> First day on the job. Great, huh?
[0:49:14] <Mangahero18> Montreal should be renamed Raccoon City.
[0:49:15] <ketchuo13> I thought he left a few days after RE2
[0:49:17] <WAE21> No
[0:49:20] <+GameBeardHS> and all those zombies just lett after he did so they didnt have to fight them
[0:49:21] <The_Butterfly_Man> I want to play as hunk all the time
[0:49:24] <$ooblagis> HUNK escapes just before the nuke
[0:49:24] <$milhousego> Why is Montreal used so often for stuff like this?
[0:49:25] <Meekest> The RPD is WAYYY more fucked in Hunk's version, wtf are you talking about Pat
[0:49:27] <Desertfishing> you bump into him as you enter the gate
[0:49:29] <%Corporate_Redeemer> @angriestpat The Subway is going to be an area for Kendo's scenario
[0:49:31] <%ElenaManetta> Why would a Canadian city be fucked by a pharmaceutical company anyway? It really should be more American, unless Canadians are doing some dank ass things behind the scenes
[0:49:31] <%Everpresent_Overseer> We all knew Canadians were housing Bioterrorism. They were too nice to be true
[0:49:31] <gustavozxd> wait I thought hunk escaped after them
[0:49:32] <%lewdskeletor13> He left before the Nuke went off didn’t he?
[0:49:35] <%cureneckbeard> There's a dude on Reddit who can recognise any town from its street layout

[0:49:49] <%Fenrirlives> oh does he not get the G sample? I thought he got it and escaped after Leon in 2?
[0:49:50] <haisho> HUNK escaped as they were faffing around in the lab.
[0:49:51] <+ateliermorgan> jill is unconscious in a church rn
[0:49:51] <greenwashcloth> pretty big city for one police station
[0:49:52] <bigdumbidiotguy> I would assume he left the RPD right after claire and Leon left

[0:49:54] <Vohs_Bru> Dont look at the ZOMBIES
[0:49:54] <lesbianmimikyu> I thought he left like right before the nuke, doesn't the heli guy say something like that
[0:49:55] <%NovaKnightmare> that annoucement probably killed more people than helprf
[0:49:58] <serra255> HE left after the front doors to the RPD were blocked
[0:49:59] <%NovaKnightmare> helped*
[0:49:59] <madogod> what you drinking pat?
[0:49:59] <42nfl19> It was after cause even in dialogue they said escape before they nuke/wipe the place

[0:50:04] <$HentaiSenpai9K> But Jill left after Leon
[0:50:05] <devanmuse> It had to be AFTER Mr X dropped in, but BEFORE Mr X died, right?

[0:51:51] <Meekest> @AngriestPat Every costume has degradation, your Leon'll look nice and shitty by the end
[0:51:53] <%ThatGuyfromMars> Leon looks like shit by the end, his shirt went from a light blue to like a navy color by the end
[0:51:53] <GameXful2> the costumes get fucked up too @AngriestPat
[0:51:53] <Soul_Intern> BOOBIES
[0:51:53] <jacksawjack> And covered in shit.
[0:51:54] <twoface1240> i miss twobestfriends. RIP
[0:51:55] <%rumtumtugnutz> hhhhhhooooooooseeeeeeeeeers
[0:51:56] <%JJCheeker> his real name is Hung
[0:51:56] <Desertfishing> sounds like Plague needs to read the wiki Kappa
[0:51:56] <dukenux> dirty Clairw
[0:51:56] <%connos_livereview> yeah the damaged models is a really nice touch
[0:51:56] <ChiefSombrero> Costumes also take damage
[0:51:59] <PSI_Guy95> Agent HUNK, and his teammates Major Dreamboat and Private 'Prince' Charming
[0:52:00] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Fun Fact: Hunk has blonde hair
[0:52:00] <%Implosivestar> Leon Kennedy's school of driving didn't last very long did it
[0:52:01] <lizard0tm> Huk, aka Grim Reaper aka Death
[0:52:03] <$megamonmon123> they also look like shit cause they fell into the sewers
[0:52:04] <GUNxSPECTRE> Wait, this isn't KH3
[0:52:06] <thelonechris> Just like how Batman gets more and more damaged as the Arkham games progress
[0:52:07] <+harpsichord_uiy> Did they model Claire after Hunger Games Woman
[0:52:07] <%Bailey__gaming> Bio Slime
[0:52:10] <%rumtumtugnutz> tofu
[0:52:10] <alexandrecau> he wanted his code name to be tofu but it was taken
[0:52:12] <OwlLightningMage> The real super power they have is that somehow they don't get regular infected by anything for some reason
[0:52:14] <+ziplockfriday> its like you dont understand human anatomay .... what whaa wait ....

[0:52:27] <%rumtumtugnutz> tofu is the real hunk
[0:52:27] <%connos_livereview> SORRY ABOUT THAT BABe
[0:52:29] <Vohs_Bru> I dont like that its super easy to erach the police station
[0:52:30] <majindusto> Its stipid how accurately they made Leon's costume....Byt Claire had to be made "Sexy" and be so inaccurate!!!
[0:52:30] <GohanEgret> when is it going to play CLOWNS FARTING IN THE BASEMENT
[0:52:30] <%DirtyGaijin> I was disappointed at how short a walk it was to the RPD
[0:52:30] <%ElenaManetta> If anyone saw zombies in the real world, would they actually mentally comprehend the situation or would most people, even trained military folk, just fucking freeze up because they literally don't know what is happening
[0:52:31] <%ramielthe5th> Look at those Claire Shoulders apatLiz
[0:52:32] <blackbookalpha> wait til Pat hears the DUN DUNT! music
[0:52:32] <+SWindleFeD> Kinda annoyed we don't go through the gun store to get to the station

[0:52:47] <+HoloToast> right, the soundtrack, that's what I forgot when I played this again sbfpPatschwitz
[0:52:49] <+Zerodyne90> yeah I miss RE4 Leon
[0:52:50] <lizard0tm> @AngriestPat Wow, this KH3 gameplay looks a lot more serious than I remember the series being
[0:52:53] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Wait, but the MR X theme will be different too. Aw man. I liked the new one
[0:52:53] <zafooru> can you imagine if everything was alright when they get to the police station
[0:52:54] <%DirtyGaijin> My pepis is ready
[0:52:56] <+harpsichord_uiy> Isn't "theyve all turned" anachronistic? this is the first zombie outbreak ._.
[0:52:57] <%Ultradoom333> hey guys what difficulty is this
[0:52:58] <%ThatGuyfromMars> I put down KH3 for this, pat, don't let me down
[0:52:58] <thelonechris> What difficulty is this on?
[0:52:59] <Darlington_the_Deceiver> Maybe goofy and donald are at the poilice station Kappa
[0:52:59] <reonome> why is that gate open
[0:53:04] <%willjar313> Now we're safe forever.

[0:53:05] <$megamonmon123> @elenamanetta idk, we have seen alot of zombie media to get over that eventually
[0:53:07] <Mr_Strut> Nothing bad EVER happened in a police station
[0:53:07] <%lewdskeletor13> Leon will learn to suplex zombies eventually
[0:53:07] <GUNxSPECTRE> KH3 is better than RE2 because 3 is bigger than 2
[0:53:08] <%Plague_Nurse> Normal, everyone
[0:53:09] <%Corporate_Redeemer> Locked the gate on Claire
[0:53:10] <+asgard147> Kreygasm

[0:53:50] <%LogothX> I prefer soundtracks like this over ambient stuff honestly
[0:53:50] <$ooblagis> @ElenaManetta Most people are split. In immediate crisis most people either panic, or go into ultra calm crisis management mode. Very few freeze when they don't have the option

[0:58:41] <%AirlineFood74> Marvin saves Leon/Claire because he can grab their waists

[1:00:36] <PSI_Guy95> Leon you're late. You're really late.
[1:00:37] <%ToneBacas> Marvin's one hand is better than both Leon's and Claire's hands
[1:00:39] <+SenorCounter> They should have gotten Danny Glover to Voice act Marvin
[1:00:39] <twoface1240> stole his wallet too
[1:00:39] <%TeraMercier> They shoulda put a bunch of spaghetti in a coconut and broke it
[1:00:40] <+zaworldo> If marvin wasn't infected, he'd solo berkin fr
[1:00:42] <+Zerodyne90> but you can't do anything

[1:01:10] <+harpsichord_uiy> SECRET TUNNELLLL
[1:01:12] <Darlington_the_Deceiver> they had to nerf marvin by injuring him from the start FeelsBadMan
[1:01:12] <DIOandTheWorld> @DuoScratch why not? Not like he thinks he can survive. He knows he's been bitten.
[1:01:12] <+HoloToast> secret passage? in a Resident Evil game?
[1:01:14] <Antecursor> So is this where he gets the uniform when you're not using costumes?
[1:01:14] <jacksawjack> Bullshit Leon, you had a fight with your girlfriend and got drunk.
[1:01:14] <%Remery_> I really like that they added the new ass-eating zombies in this game :)
[1:01:16] <+Alcamest> How Many Times Pat Play this now?
[1:01:16] <CptBritches> BibleThump
[1:01:16] <%NovaKnightmare> Elliot really cuts himself short

[1:01:19] <reonome> marvin BIbleThump 7
[1:01:20] <%lewdskeletor13> Egotistical Leon LUL
[1:01:21] <Cthulos> Leon's original outfit makes it look like he was supposed to be a motorcycle cop
[1:01:21] <%TeraMercier> Nah, he wishes he could have helped at a more instrumental time
[1:01:22] <dukenux> GODDAMIT ROOKIE
[1:01:25] <%Ahack13> How did Eliot find out about the passage?
[1:01:26] <%riantDeliration> i like his dialogue with Leon a lot more
[1:01:26] <%LogothX> God damnit Darpa chief!
[1:01:26] <%Corporate_Redeemer> Noooo, not Will Smith!!
[1:01:31] <reonome> BibleThump 7
[1:01:31] <+EmotionalFatGuy> Marvin has the best voice and character model
[1:01:32] <+8framelag> Marvin doesn't point his gun at Claire PogChamp

[1:01:34] <ChiefSombrero> BibleThump Marvin best bro
[1:01:34] <+Tarantulawl> Rookie? Marvin's the one who couldn't conserve his ammo...

[1:01:47] <%UW_Duncan> I can't take this, it's covered in your goo

[1:01:51] <+Alcamest> WHEN MARVIN DLC?
[1:01:53] <%crimsonharvest> Marvin's face is really good
[1:01:53] <%UltraCasualBoom> Stop. Drop. Shut them down and open up shop!!!
[1:01:54] <neooneshin> Marvin looks kinda Japanese
[1:01:55] <DuoScratch> @DIOandTheWorld it's more that Leon should be helping Marvin up when he stumbles after being a bad ass. ;p
[1:01:55] <+harpsichord_uiy> will die for marvin
[1:01:56] <%MyDarkStorm> Dont Be bitch ricky
[1:01:56] <dukenux> BibleThump
[1:01:56] <%ThatGuyfromMars> Marvin is fucking awesome in Remake 2
[1:01:56] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Marvin's facial capture is great
[1:01:57] <Cthulos> I like how the line delivery changes for the routes
[1:01:57] <JoshyJ> Marvin PepeHands
[1:01:59] <Vohs_Bru> Marvin is turning into a white man , you know he is evil
[1:01:59] <OwlLightningMage> Why does he have two lazy eyes though?
[1:01:59] <marvel877> I love the different line reads between characters
[1:01:59] <bigdumbidiotguy> Marvin Branagh
[1:01:59] <@PlagueOfGripes> Thanks Will Smith
[1:02:00] <GUNxSPECTRE> Gray Zombie Marvin, not so much
[1:02:00] <+8framelag> Marvin DLC ooh
[1:02:01] <+HoloToast> if Marvin was outside before this did he get bit by Brad?
[1:02:01] <+solzan2000> marvin the mvp
[1:02:01] <PROUD2beGINGER> Run like a bitch Leon
[1:02:03] <+Blain_Cooper> <3 Marvin
[1:02:05] <+Spikyshrike> I would LOVE Marvin DLC PogChamp
[1:02:05] <blackbookalpha> softboi Leon
[1:02:06] <+risenlp2> Shoot Marvin
[1:02:06] <%DirtyGaijin> Marvin for Ghost survivors?
[1:02:07] <%RandyBobandy72> that would be a cool dlc with marvin
[1:02:07] <+Talbz> Marvin is the true hero of RE
[1:02:08] <Jugg4n4ut> Marvin is best boy
[1:02:08] <Cthulos> it's a nice touch
[1:02:09] <reddeadwine1277> Wool Smoth
[1:02:11] <%willjar313> Marvin is the hero we need, but not the one we deserve.
[1:02:12] <alexandrecau> Marvin was the first LEGEND
[1:02:13] <%TeraMercier> His textures look like he has little blood left in him
[1:02:14] <gustavozxd> the kendo gun store from the original to the remake is insane
[1:02:15] <%fattness132> TAKE THIS KEYCARD
[1:02:16] <FriendlyCheer> Him dealing with his pain is just like paige and her back problems!
[1:02:16] <Ultimatefool> Looks like your party...has been cancelled
[1:02:16] <A_Zealous_Retort> paid DLC costumes for Marvin
[1:02:16] <%JJCheeker> I miss the old marvin's moans
[1:02:16] <%ElenaManetta> His facial animation is so good I'm convinced they re-used the black cop from RE7's facial capture tech or something because he seems to have better expressions than anyone else in the game.
[1:02:18] <%Codemaster7777> "I'm black and dead as shit" -Matt "If-Hes-Old- Put-'Em-In-A-Choke-Hold" McMuscles
[1:02:20] <+McSnazzyPants> @AngriestPat mind doing a run with all settings as low as possible? might be more reminiscent of the ps1 version LUL
[1:02:20] <Nighthawkmun> Marvin DLC would be sick
[1:02:22] <allanmiri> Marvin is a bro
[1:02:24] <+Nomicro4u> ITS MY FIRST DAY
[1:02:25] <krimshot846> How much of this game is like the original? Obviously not the camera, but like the levels and story
[1:02:28] <%Taisuru> This an alt costume?
[1:02:29] <%Typhaeon> Marvin better be one of the non-canon survivors in the DLC modes
[1:02:29] <PROUD2beGINGER> Now go
[1:02:30] <DIOandTheWorld> @DuoScratch you're missing the point. Marvin has nothing to lose, helping Leon up. His death is guaranteed.
[1:02:32] <%Ell1ot> if will smith dies here then he wont have that weird kid
[1:02:33] <%AbnormalVoid> It's how I imagine my first day
[1:02:34] <%AirlineFood74> @AngriestPat Download the RE7 Chris modelswap and do a knife-only run pls
[1:02:34] <Divantae> The real Resident Evil is the friends we made along the way
[1:02:35] <@PlagueOfGripes> I loved you in Men in Black, Marvin
[1:02:35] <42nfl19> samurai edge?
[1:02:36] <+HoloToast> Marvin DLC: get fucked up as fast as possible sbfpPatschwitz
[1:02:37] <%Corporate_Redeemer> I would no joke love a Marvin-centered dlc. He should've been a Ghost Survivor instead of a SOLDIER
[1:02:37] <%DirtyGaijin> Id like a DLC for the police station during the outbreak
[1:02:38] <theInkShow> That means he is jobless=?
[1:02:38] <person181> paige you crazy
[1:02:39] <+EmotionalFatGuy> They should have an alternate DLC with his first day without the outbreak
[1:02:41] <davejackman> LMAO

[1:03:40] <%TaifuDragon> @AngriestPat Paige should be a civil officer. They're cops that do all that helping-cats-out-of-trees stuff because real police really don't have the time

[1:03:44] <Antecursor> The only thing pat knows is how little he knows
[1:03:45] <+Kingjhon8> this sounds like old games sounds, neat

[1:04:57] <reonome> KNIFE ONLY RUN LETS GO
[1:04:58] <jacksawjack> Beware the Nugget Zombies. Even without limbs they can stun lock to death.
[1:04:59] <%AirlineFood74> standard
[1:05:00] <%UW_Duncan> this is pathetic
[1:05:01] <luckysteak> behold, the power of KNIFE
[1:05:01] <+HoloToast> this is how every infinite knife runs go btw
[1:05:02] <+Talbz> I LOVE the contrast between this game and RE4
[1:05:02] <+8framelag> increase the fps, it buffs the knife TPFufun
[1:05:02] <%TeraMercier> The canon costume looks much more like a legit cop outfit
[1:05:02] <%RandyBobandy72> WOO
[1:05:03] <%lewdskeletor13> @ozzyzak Watch Pat obviously apatSmug
[1:05:04] <42nfl19> will the infinite blade not effect his score or the ability to unlock stuff?
[1:05:05] <%Hazard_Kujacker> AIIIIIIEEEEEeeee
[1:05:06] <figysmalls_> lol
[1:05:08] <Ultimatefool> Knife can swing like 90 times on standard, way better than 2 counters
[1:05:08] <%Corporate_Redeemer> @angriestpat CAPCOM really went out of their way to improve the RE knives from RE7 and now this
[1:05:08] <theTrapWizard> mr.raccoon west offf
[1:05:09] <arfsm95> @TeraMercier yeah but he knows the combination already
[1:05:10] <+Blackgaver> dad?
[1:05:10] <Vohs_Bru> Pat stop, he was just exhausted from the masturbation
[1:05:10] <DonatelloJose> Yes my lucky brothers. RISE UP
[1:05:11] <%ElenaManetta> That's.... dumb
[1:05:12] <%DirtyGaijin> how?
[1:05:13] <$ooblagis> Protip: Knives are tied to framerate, high framerates turns your knife into STUPID powerful damage
[1:05:17] <GoldeNOVA> Leon training for that Krauser fight
[1:05:18] <+8framelag> 240p
[1:05:19] <%AncelDeLambert> what is WRONG with people?
[1:05:20] <The_Blumper> even against bosses?
[1:05:21] <%ozzyzak> @lewdskeletor13 that would be the easiest choice... hmmm
[1:05:23] <davejackman> NED MRG
[1:05:24] <%Laecerelius> WE DO IT!
[1:05:27] <OwlLightningMage> That seems like a massive oversight LUL
[1:05:28] <%connos_livereview> lol i missed that one
[1:05:29] <ScreamingMeat> Ned
[1:05:29] <%GeneralSCPatton> @42nfl19 It only prevents S+ rank

[1:05:30] <reddeadwine1277> We are the Blaarrgh. Resistance is futile. Taste is unimportant .
[1:05:30] <%commanderclaw> Knife only hardcore run under 1 hour already done
[1:05:31] <thelonechris> How do you kill the gator using only a knife?
[1:05:34] <PSI_Guy95> THAT'S THE WAY WE DO IT
[1:05:34] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat why the framerate up?

[1:05:40] <Antecursor> Damn Leon is one hell of a cop
[1:05:40] <Jugg4n4ut> MORE LIKE MPREG
[1:05:40] <RiverBirch> Nef Anyo?
[1:05:40] <+cappyd33> speedruuuuuuuuuun
[1:05:41] <+Verd_254> what does having the frame rate turned up do?
[1:05:41] <DIOandTheWorld> I hope they manage to fix that framerate damage glitch. But FromSoft sure never fixed that for DS2...
[1:05:42] <$megamonmon123> someone did a tofu run in about 9 minutes
[1:05:42] <%Laecerelius> Nef Anyo's a bitch!
[1:05:45] <RiverBirch> Did someone say, NEF ANYO?
[1:05:45] <Helghast102> the knife is super broken with high framerates, it's CVX all over again but worse
[1:05:46] <Youwereeatenbyalid> OH FORTUNA
[1:05:46] <+Spikyshrike> Knife only speedrun, hard, no damage --> one hour
[1:05:47] <+greyestfox> this soundtrack is so much bettdt

[1:05:56] <%JJCheeker> It's not quite like the knife in code veronica though
[1:05:57] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat why with the framerate up?
[1:05:58] <deadredeyez> "Knife fight" "you betta fight for your life"
[1:05:58] <PROUD2beGINGER> Okaly Dokely
[1:05:58] <%DirtyGaijin> Love the original OST
[1:05:59] <%AirlineFood74> @Verd_254 Knife durability is tied to frame rate LUL
[1:06:01] <%ToneBacas> the music is going nuts

[1:06:20] <+Verd_254> @AirlineFood74 dark souls all over again LUL
[1:06:20] <$Bane_Kaikyo> So I guessin this is Leon A ?
[1:06:20] <Gruhunchously> @AirlineFood74 But how?

[1:06:26] <PROUD2beGINGER> ???
[1:06:27] <Youwereeatenbyalid> Oh wow you were serious
[1:06:28] <faegbeard> thanks japan
[1:06:28] <Jugg4n4ut> lmao
[1:06:28] <TheEnablerr> WHAT.
[1:06:29] <Ion_LaserX> That is ridiculous
[1:06:29] <%cureneckbeard> You're a little rusto apatPat
[1:06:29] <%connos_livereview> hon hon
[1:06:32] <DIOandTheWorld> @PlagueOfGripes they locked it as a prank before the zombie outbreak, then added the "Be glad you're not here" at the end after the outbreak started
[1:06:32] <Helghast102> higher framerate = knife hits more per swing
[1:06:33] <$ooblagis> It's the DS2 durability bug, basically
[1:06:33] <TheHeroAppears> mid max that frame rate you bastard
[1:06:33] <dekkitout> makes sense
[1:06:34] <%3xgilly> HUH
[1:06:35] <blackbookalpha> We Vanquish now <3
[1:06:37] <+Alig200> play at the 640x480 for the ultimate knife.
[1:06:37] <+Nomicro4u> WHO SAID THAT
[1:06:38] <+Talbz> @AngriestPat I think the fastest time for Leon A is 59 minutes
[1:06:39] <Vohs_Bru> classic japanese game design

[1:06:40] <%AirlineFood74> @Youwereeatenbyalid I was LUL
[1:06:41] <the_sprankton> it's like mom's knife in Isaac?
[1:06:41] <%GeneralSCPatton> Really?
[1:06:42] <valentinostand> hey pat do you love RE2 MORE than Paige?
[1:06:43] <%Hazard_Kujacker> Why do devs tie things to Framerate
[1:06:44] <Ion_LaserX> How do you code a knife in a game like that?
[1:06:44] <blackbookalpha> more fps = more knife dmg
[1:06:45] <+Nomicro4u> I heard a zombie noise
[1:06:46] <%3xgilly> !uptime
[1:06:46] <%TeraMercier> PC players get better knives than PS4
[1:06:46] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 6m.
[1:06:47] <TakesGuts> bethesda tier knife
[1:06:49] <TheEnablerr> How does that even-
[1:06:52] <%lewdskeletor13> WHO HICCUPED
[1:06:52] <%Agent_For_Hire> Its the same thing as DS2's collision physics
[1:06:53] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Who hiccuping?
[1:06:57] <C_S_N_G> For a second I thought Paige's hiccup was a zombie
[1:06:57] <+Nomicro4u> Zombie Hiccup
[1:06:59] <+8framelag> low res is the new meta
[1:06:59] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @AirlineFood74 that's absurd. Still, I guess the physics aren't tied to it
[1:07:01] <+mechslayer71> The same Jann ass shit they were doing in fucking DARK SOULS 1 WHY DO THEY STILL DO THIS
[1:07:03] <%TeraMercier> Who's belching
[1:07:04] <%DirtyGaijin> how?
[1:07:05] <Finakala> Uncapped framerate Need for Speed is the best
[1:07:05] <+Blackgaver> 59 mins monkaS
[1:07:06] <+mechslayer71> JANK*
[1:07:06] <+harpsichord_uiy> j e s u s
[1:07:06] <theInkShow> WTF
[1:07:08] <missingangle> wut
[1:07:08] <+Zerodyne90> Was that a zombie or paige
[1:07:10] <TheEnablerr> DAMN
[1:07:11] <theInkShow> Bugs?
[1:07:12] <PROUD2beGINGER> There's more people now
[1:07:13] <$ooblagis> Oh, they did get to sub 1 hour today?
[1:07:13] <$megamonmon123> yeah its 59
[1:07:14] <Ultimatefool> This save room Kreygasm
[1:07:14] <+asgard147> really? monkaS
[1:07:15] <%Codemaster7777> I did it in an hour 50
[1:07:17] <%Laecerelius> Don't know how do but it do
[1:07:19] <righteousjam> characters move faster, simple
[1:07:20] <%connos_livereview> 59 mins is ludicrous my best is 2 hours
[1:07:20] <lemon_lore> only been like 1week
[1:07:22] <+Blackgaver> mix da herbs
[1:07:22] <Ion_LaserX> NOSTALGIA PEPIS GO UP
[1:07:22] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat how people figure out the framerate stuff?
[1:07:23] <+HoloToast> and here I was proud of my 2h30 Leon run LUL
[1:07:23] <person181> so calming
[1:07:24] <+Blackgaver> 420
[1:07:25] <Videogamer4> music Kreygasm
[1:07:25] <dukenux> thought you will say 15
[1:07:26] <+MeatBomb> Track jams.
[1:07:28] <%ThePuddingDead> I remember this as the theme from their Revelations 2 LP
[1:07:28] <$megamonmon123> it was like 1:10 the day the game came out
[1:07:29] <Vohs_Bru> the original can be beat under 45 minutes
[1:07:30] <lionmanguy> Those red herbs look familiar for some reason
[1:07:30] <reonome> they did it by going out of bounds
[1:07:31] <%templar010> Kreygasm
[1:07:31] <CptBritches> They've already found a couple of out of bounds glitches, apparently
[1:07:32] <Grennold> The knife framerate glitch helps
[1:07:32] <dukenux> Kreygasm
[1:07:33] <DIOandTheWorld> The knife damage is based on for how many frames the knife is inside an enemys hitbox. So on PC knives are better than on console LUL
[1:07:34] <%valriot> My fastest is about 1:43 but ye peolle are nuts
[1:07:35] <bigdumbidiotguy> I've been watching the speed runners since the release and those dudes start on Hardcore and work backwards.
[1:07:37] <lionmanguy> Like I've seen that plant in real life
[1:07:37] <$Bane_Kaikyo> blaz erb
[1:07:37] <%Corporate_Redeemer> SPEEDRUN FAILED
[1:07:38] <DonatelloJose> speedrunners are not normal people.
[1:07:39] <%TeraMercier> Pat mix the gunpowder with your gout
[1:07:42] <dukenux> so saaafe
[1:07:42] <valentinostand> hey Pat do you Love this Game MORE than Paige
[1:07:42] <+asgard147> Kreygasm
[1:07:42] <righteousjam> not tank controls, ez
[1:07:44] <DuoScratch> That seems like too fast...but then again, I love to take my time with games like this, so yeah...there ya go.
[1:07:45] <+Blackgaver> typewriter noise LUL
[1:07:45] <%ThePuddingDead> God I hope we get Revelations 3
[1:07:47] <Youwereeatenbyalid> Idk why but that music reminds me of hollow knight

[1:07:55] <HowlJames> You know what the PS4 version should have had? The color on the controller would change based off health. Kinda like the controller attachment for the dreamcast

[1:08:27] <InkyDraconian> stab him more he doesn't deserve tendons
[1:08:27] <%rdark_ksu> @AngriestPat What is Paige's RE2? Is it just her love for Final Fantasy or does she have an even bigger favorite?
[1:08:28] <PSI_Guy95> lady cops are THE TOUGHEST
[1:08:30] <%AncelDeLambert> So this is why Leon's so into his knife in 4
[1:08:34] <HowlJames> Does it?
[1:08:35] <$megamonmon123> @angriestpat do you know the trick with birken and the flamethrower in your second fight with him?
[1:08:35] <%mostundesired> Damn, she's stronk
[1:08:35] <%MyDarkStorm> Miss
[1:08:36] <PSI_Guy95> she's also a single mom which is why she's so RESILIANT
[1:08:39] <TheEnablerr> Kevlar wigs man
[1:08:42] <%crimsonharvest> real question, ddoes every bitten person get changed into a zombie or do some just die for real right then
[1:08:43] <The_Blumper> thats why she was a cop
[1:08:44] <Gruhunchously> Paige approves
[1:08:46] <blackbaron98> we really used to do a dance called the stanky leg LUL
[1:08:48] <Gweryan> @PSI_Guy95 LUL
[1:08:48] <%DirtyGaijin> @ilpeggiore_ it was a deluxe edition thing that you can turn on in options
[1:08:48] <FoulNightingale> This a hardcore run?
[1:08:49] <SoFarFetched> Wouldn't shooting the legs be better?
[1:08:49] <DIOandTheWorld> @Gruhunchously nothing new from PC versions from Japanese devs. In Dark Souls 2 your weapons degrade like many times faster on PC because durability is tied to framerate, and FromSoft never fixed it

[1:09:46] <%LogothX> yeahhhh
[1:09:48] <hntronium> BOOO THAT CHRONO CROSS
[1:09:50] <PROUD2beGINGER> Play funky town
[1:09:50] <%Laecerelius> Pat is already forgetting
[1:09:53] <DIOandTheWorld> @Xaxas115 remake is not a remaster though, completely different things. RE4 remake but horror instead of action would be sweet
[1:09:54] <%AirlineFood74> Oh no Pat's stupid
[1:09:54] <Helghast102> puzzle god
[1:09:54] <garbageheaphound> Pat
[1:09:56] <reonome> you're just bad pat
[1:09:57] <%AncelDeLambert> FF7 is already a massive trash fire, so that's a bust
[1:09:58] <%nademonkey1100> MGS for me
[1:09:58] <+CrowGuy> Pat do you have any merch man?
[1:09:59] <SoFarFetched> Crazy Talks
[1:10:01] <+Bupkis7> KOTOR 2 for me
[1:10:01] <$ooblagis> The mere mention of Crono Cross (best JRPG ever) broke Pat's mind
[1:10:02] <%MyDarkStorm> Freelancer
[1:10:02] <%lewdskeletor13> FAKE GAMER
[1:10:03] <+Blackgaver> pat please
[1:10:03] <%TeraMercier> Paige is obviously a Brute Force fan
[1:10:04] <IronhideRyback> BEEP BEEP BEEP
[1:10:05] <CptBritches> Have you seen the new fan Banjo-Kazooie game where it takes place in the map of Ocarina of Time?
[1:10:05] <Gruhunchously> Bleep Bloop Blip
[1:10:06] <missingangle> at least you didn't take ten minutes ammirite
[1:10:06] <Futuretimetraveller> @AncelDeLambert I know... And we'll never get a proper sequel
[1:10:09] <%DirtyGaijin> That reminds me of the Zelda chest theme
[1:10:10] <ScreamingMeat> Portable Safes are a stupid idea
[1:10:11] <Ion_LaserX> FF7 for the PS5
[1:10:11] <Desertfishing> @AngriestPat someone is working on FF9 to make it look better I forget who but Vinny(vinesauce) knows
[1:10:13] <%ThePuddingDead> Mine was Star Fox 64, Mischief Makers and Sonic 3 and Knuckles
[1:10:14] <+Zerodyne90> zelda song
[1:10:15] <%JJCheeker> i miss doodLoen
[1:10:19] <AbnormalEnd> i just want a metroid fusion sequel
[1:10:20] <TheEnablerr> Reminder that keyboards do NOT work that way.
[1:10:21] <pimpinahz> would love a remake of Zelda: A link to the past and a remake of Ocarina of Time
[1:10:22] <dukenux> i agree
[1:10:22] <%Toynota10> i see what you did there Paige
[1:10:23] <GUNxSPECTRE> It wouldn't work today
[1:10:23] <jacksawjack> Pat, any puzzle kicks your ass. :p
[1:10:24] <OwlLightningMage> Chrono R though
[1:10:24] <%TeraMercier> And why would you put a plastic key in a portable safe
[1:10:24] <Youwereeatenbyalid> That said, gib sequel
[1:10:25] <$ooblagis> Chronot Trigger is the least flawed game of all time
[1:10:27] <+Blackgaver> chrono trigger Kreygasm
[1:10:28] <%AirlineFood74> Remake Chrono Trigger but make it good
[1:10:28] <JoshyJ> FF7 for the PS8 cant wait
[1:10:28] <+LowBatteryLife> Perfect in every way.
[1:10:30] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@Fujiwara_92)
[1:10:32] <%Laecerelius> Devil Cry May
[1:10:33] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> DISGUSTED
[1:10:34] <%FracturedImage> loCkER
[1:10:34] <%DirtyGaijin> oh god a Chrono trigger remake
[1:10:35] <Divantae> People are asking for an RE4 remake laugh at them carciLeon
[1:10:35] <a_mad_dragon> DS version of chrono trigger is the best, if you ignore the added dungeons
[1:10:36] <theInkShow> tur
[1:10:37] <OhioNitsud> Mine is GTA 4 although I don't like R* as a developer anymore
[1:10:38] <Xaxas115> DIOandTheWorld your right, but like its perfect imo. I just thought more and I say Crimson Skies
[1:10:38] <dukenux> it is timeless Kappa
[1:10:41] <%AirlineFood74> I meant Chrono Cross LUL
[1:10:41] <Futuretimetraveller> Golden Sun!
[1:10:43] <luckysteak> chrono trigger is an example of style aging well
[1:10:44] <Valentinius_Anodyne> GBA version is fine looking
[1:10:45] <bigdumbidiotguy> I like how if you flip the portable safes upside down the item makes the sound of hitting the bottom of the safe.
[1:10:49] <+Demichan> did you see chrono trigger 3d fan made trailer? it was so cool cell shaded
[1:10:52] <blackbookalpha> Chronic Cross
[1:10:53] <%LogothX> GBA version has fucked up sound
[1:10:54] <dukenux> RE4 dont need a remake yet
[1:10:55] <%Fenrirlives> what's up with that version?
[1:10:56] <RiverBirch> Megaman Legend 1
[1:10:58] <%cureneckbeard> The PS1 version is fine
[1:11:01] <RiverBirch> I'd cry if that got remade
[1:11:02] <%AncelDeLambert> I guess the Monkey Island games? But you can only replay those so many times
[1:11:02] <Desertfishing> she mean chrono cross
[1:11:03] <@PlagueOfGripes> this room sucks
[1:11:04] <PSI_Guy95> How do we feel about retranslations? Like CTDS getting rid of Frog's ye olde talke
[1:11:04] <%3xgilly> Tony Hawk Pro Skater 3 PLZZZZZZZ
[1:11:05] <Youwereeatenbyalid> NOT THE DS VERSION
[1:11:05] <Huntercd> I love Pat like this
[1:11:05] <+harpsichord_uiy> is this HC or Standard
[1:11:06] <SoFarFetched> Does Paige like the cutscenes for Chrono Trigger on the PS1?
[1:11:08] <+Nomicro4u> mutheeeerr
[1:11:08] <OwlLightningMage> chrono resurrection looked so cool though
[1:11:08] <+HoloToast> Earthbound is amazeballs
[1:11:10] <%ThePuddingDead> I wish someone could sell me on ChronoTrigger...
[1:11:10] <%DirtyGaijin> @Demichan that the one that got destroyed due to Copyrights?
[1:11:10] <bigdumbidiotguy> Chrono triggers original English translation is poopie
[1:11:11] <Finakala> Vita version of FFVI is good other than the PS1 load times
[1:11:12] <Vohs_Bru> you can say about this game as well
[1:11:13] <jj_cabo> Just like Woolz

[1:11:18] <FriendlyCheer> Co LP with Woolie!
[1:11:19] <%vaporousTippler> Chrono Trigger looking like DQ8/11 would be fine by me.
[1:11:19] <%ThePuddingDead> I had it, and couldnt bring myself to play it
[1:11:20] <%TheGreatBamBe> LITERALLY A BETTER undertale
[1:11:20] <PROUD2beGINGER> Earthbound is Undertale
[1:11:21] <%AncelDeLambert> Like, there's no point to me replaying Curse of Monkey Island, I know it back to front
[1:11:22] <ebonifragaria> HOLY SHIT Play MOther 3!!!!
[1:11:22] <theInkShow> PLAY WITH WOOLIE
[1:11:22] <DIOandTheWorld> @Xaxas115 its good but I never found it the best RE because its not scary at all. Too goofy and too action focused. According to the end result screen, you kill around 900 enemies in RE4 lol.

[1:14:00] <+solzan2000> new tech cool
[1:14:01] <42nfl19> Was there ever knife durability in the first game?
[1:14:01] <%JJCheeker> dat a** must be tasty
[1:14:01] <%TeraMercier> @ElenaManetta The entire game's structure and gameplay design is based on not moving while shooting.
[1:14:01] <+Puppet88> YALL DIDNT KNOW!??
[1:14:01] <deadredeyez> I'm shook
[1:14:02] <%ElenaManetta> I adore these key animations
[1:14:02] <GUNxSPECTRE> Punch boulders motherfucker
[1:14:02] <%GeneralSCPatton> @xaxas115 You have to retrieve it
[1:14:03] <+Yokuho> Speedrunning was a mistake

[1:14:04] <%DirtyGaijin> how strong is Leon?
[1:14:04] <%NobleJedi> so much time I could have saved against Mr X....
[1:14:04] <%mostundesired> For the record, that's how those things work in real life. It's only impressive because a game can do it.
[1:14:05] <%Finalknightmare> you can do it to all four
[1:14:05] <%TheGreatBamBe> I missed the tech
[1:14:06] <@PlagueOfGripes> they should be pretty easy to move
[1:14:07] <%TheGreatBamBe> what was it
[1:14:07] <Sinister_Aglet> BUT CAN He PUNCH A BOULDER?
[1:14:09] <+8framelag> lol fuck you X

[1:14:23] <deadredeyez> Mr x beat my a$$ in that library
[1:14:25] <+manwithboxonhead> Fat EVIL
[1:14:26] <Kyderz3> does pat like this game more than RE4?
[1:14:26] <%Dungeon00X> I had a job where I could do that with rolling racks and I did that immediately
[1:14:27] <%lewdskeletor13> COP DAD NOO
[1:14:29] <bigdumbidiotguy> *rescue the survivors. get yer shit right patato
[1:14:29] <GUNxSPECTRE> Leon is such a sweet baby boy
[1:14:31] <%Codemaster7777> WHAT
[1:14:34] <%CollinsOfBodom> Marvin's on Netflix
[1:14:35] <JoshyJ> tfw claire hardly remembers leon name but he remembers her name
[1:14:35] <Desertfishing> ya we fucked before the zombies showed
[1:14:35] <Xaxas115> GeneralSCPatton Thanks, but im a bit sad, i hoped it would be new best friend knife
[1:14:35] <%Codemaster7777> YOOO
[1:14:35] <+HoloToast> long sleeves
[1:14:35] <@PlagueOfGripes> did Marvin get bit in the front of his stomach?
[1:14:36] <%Corporate_Redeemer> Time for flirting!!
[1:14:38] <$megamonmon123> @thegreatokosan you can move the book cases in a row instead of one at a time
[1:14:38] <%AirlineFood74> Time for Claire and Leon to give each other the fuck eyes Kreygasm
[1:14:49] <%lewdskeletor13> I think so Plague
[1:14:49] <dukenux> Damn Marvin dying and he steal have enough strentght for one last fap. F
[1:14:53] <Desertfishing> cause she's a girl
[1:14:54] <%ThePuddingDead> He's his C.O.
[1:14:54] <PSI_Guy95> poor Marv
[1:14:56] <thelonechris> He's Leon's superior
[1:14:56] <+Blackgaver> brace face LUL
[1:14:58] <+SenorCounter> Putting on a brave face for a civilian
[1:15:00] <A_Zealous_Retort> wait is that where they meet after the helicopter crashes? does B just sit and wait there for a few hours?
[1:15:01] <+8framelag> he likes her
[1:15:02] <Reanimator83> I did those one at a time with Mr. X breathing down my neck FailFish
[1:15:03] <%hamborhger> based marv
[1:15:04] <%Aztec50> he a good police ossifer
[1:15:07] <%DirtyGaijin> Shes a civilian
[1:15:07] <Divantae> Kendo in the original RE2 was waaaay more sympathetic to Claire
[1:15:08] <dukenux> Cause Leon is a rookie cop
[1:15:08] <JoshyJ> LISTEN ROOK
[1:15:08] <%TeraMercier> @PlagueOfGripes I get the implication from the Leon scenario that he was probably trying to help a cop that was a zombie
[1:15:08] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@Gogogolem) (warning)
[1:15:09] <%Codemaster7777> Dont scare the VVymin
[1:15:11] <%Corporate_Redeemer> He also draws a gun on Leon and almost bites Leon
[1:15:13] <+Verd_254> Leon is a subordinate. Treats him like one.
[1:15:13] <%ThatGuyfromMars> the last dialogue you have with marvin as leon is pretty sad too
[1:15:13] <%ToxInjection> Well, he doesn't gotta be more tough when he's a fellow cop
[1:15:14] <DIOandTheWorld> Leon is also working for him, while Claire is a random person
[1:15:14] <Angry_Ev1L> He knows that claire is chris's sister
[1:15:14] <PROUD2beGINGER> It's because she's a girl
[1:15:15] <%Codemaster7777> She a CIvi
[1:15:15] <+Sathelan1> WHAT! Mother fucker
[1:15:17] <%hamborhger> leon is a jabroni
[1:15:17] <Desertfishing> Marvin is top cop
[1:15:18] <+Alig200> @AngriestPat He seemed to be friends with Chris, so that probably played a part in being nice to Claire.
[1:15:18] <%Dungeon00X> It really is.
[1:15:18] <reonome> you're so cool marvin senpai
[1:15:19] <+Blackgaver> jizz on the music
[1:15:20] <dukenux> LISTEN HOTHEAD
[1:15:21] <%Laecerelius> Fuckin ROOKIES!
[1:15:21] <%ElenaManetta> It takes some dedicated to have individual animations according to who you're playing as
[1:15:22] <Ion_LaserX> NOSTALGIA GO UP
[1:15:25] <%ElenaManetta> some dedication even
[1:15:26] <%AirlineFood74> @A_Zealous_Retort Nah, the cutscene starts as B approaches the gate
[1:15:27] <GUNxSPECTRE> Claire reminds Marvine of his daughter
[1:15:29] <%TeraMercier> Leon immediately jumps into the chain of command, so he follows his lead
[1:15:29] <%JJCheeker> He's trying to toughen leon up
[1:15:30] <theInkShow> OKey, bye gang. will watch later.
[1:15:31] <jacksawjack> He also doesn't pull his gun on Claire
[1:15:32] <%Codemaster7777> woow twitch app is bs with the chat. It bad
[1:15:34] <PROUD2beGINGER> Gotta look tough for the girl
[1:15:34] <bigdumbidiotguy> most of the original soundtrack works really well here
[1:15:35] <%DirtyGaijin> until MR X
[1:15:36] <%lewdskeletor13> YOUR A LOOSE CANNON LEOn
[1:15:37] <+Talbz> Where's all the Marvin fanart?
[1:15:42] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat Fun fact pat being around women during times of physical pain can reduce it in men.
[1:15:43] <deadredeyez> how is this game so dam good
[1:15:44] <The_Blumper> Don't meet any Polish or Irish cops strangely enough
[1:15:44] <valentinostand> if RE2 were a Pretty Girl would Paige let you Fuck her for 1 Night?
[1:15:47] <JDRK> 208

[1:16:58] <+LethalPlacebo> You move slower.
[1:17:00] <Desertfishing> you do move slower in danger
[1:17:01] <%AirlineFood74> you do move slower
[1:17:01] <%lewdskeletor13> Mr X could get it
[1:17:01] <dukenux> From the closet
[1:17:03] <%TeraMercier> There's no cuckolds in this game 0/10
[1:17:03] <%hamborhger> @SoFarFetched That implies that someone with the voice of X isn't gonna give it to you instead
[1:17:03] <%rdark_ksu> ....I just realized something. How did Leon get the uniform for RPD if its literally his first day?
[1:17:07] <%connos_livereview> re2 is a hot MILF
[1:17:09] <+cappyd33> pat wouldn't fake it with re2
[1:17:10] <+mjkenney24> has anyone modded mr. x into shaggy yet

[1:17:12] <IsaiahOmega> airbag?
[1:17:14] <jacksawjack> Where's Mondo when you need him?
[1:17:15] <thatd00doverthere> they mailed it to him
[1:17:17] <+Blackgaver> huh they actually changed the game
[1:17:18] <+Spikyshrike> @rdark_ksu He picked it up early from the cleaners Kappa
[1:17:22] <%Tearonex> Aquarius
[1:17:23] <%Laecerelius> RE2make is the hot milf's hot daughter
[1:17:25] <%TeraMercier> @rdark_ksu He shows up in casual clothes and changes in the first scene with Marvin
[1:17:27] <%MyDarkStorm> @AngriestPat So Pat Question Do the Tyrants have a Hyper Regain If not How is mr X Is Still ALIVE?!
[1:17:28] <+HoloToast> TeraMercier Claire kinda gets cucked by Ada I guess
[1:17:30] <SoFarFetched> @hamborhger Kappa I mean I see no complaints on that
[1:17:31] <OwlLightningMage> Leon stole it. The irony
[1:17:34] <Meekest> @AngriestPat Transfer?
[1:17:34] <JoshyJ> because hes a good boy
[1:17:34] <TheEnablerr> Fish scorpion bullshit why do these exist even as a museum. the fuck umbrella.
[1:17:37] <ChiefSombrero> Or his closet is just full of police armor
[1:17:39] <pimpinahz> yiu need to get into RE2s devil pit with those kids who love rock music, cuz they are down with da devil!!!
[1:17:39] <%Laecerelius> STARS is just that good, man!
[1:17:40] <GUNxSPECTRE> Leon should be NYPD right?
[1:17:40] <Desertfishing> @AngriestPat he killed a minority
[1:17:41] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Because that's how it do
[1:17:41] <%mostundesired> Listen. You gotta work somehow.
[1:17:42] <%nademonkey1100> better pay
[1:17:42] <%ThePuddingDead> get away from the crazy bitch back home prolly
[1:17:43] <reonome> he was assigned there I guess
[1:17:43] <DuoScratch> Placements
[1:17:43] <%PaladinDupre> @AngriestPat thats actually how it usually works
[1:17:44] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@hamborhger) (warning)
[1:17:44] <%ThatGuyfromMars> maybe he can't afford to live in the city
[1:17:44] <+harpsichord_uiy> maybe he wanted to leave his hometown boyyy
[1:17:44] <Valentinius_Anodyne> He has a dark past
[1:17:45] <einSynd> Might have just been the closest with an opening
[1:17:45] <matrignomy7> Conspiracies is why!
[1:17:46] <%GrugOfWar> Leon is the Ocelot of RE
[1:17:48] <A_Zealous_Retort> cuz of the murders in the mountains
[1:17:48] <%Corporate_Redeemer> Because the dental plan
[1:17:48] <%nademonkey1100> FUCK YOU MOOBOT
[1:17:48] <%ElenaManetta> I live in NYC where it's common to commute long distances for a good job, so IDK.
[1:17:48] <$megamonmon123> dont worry about it
[1:17:49] <+MeatBomb> That always happens. Go where the openings are.
[1:17:49] <%TeraMercier> He was moving and had the plans set up
[1:17:49] <Divantae> I believe he transferred cause he wanted to be the hero and solve the murders in the mountains like a big hero
[1:17:50] <@PlagueOfGripes> do they really let people police cities they've never been to
[1:17:50] <+Talbz> He probably lived in the suburbs of RC @AngriestPat
[1:17:50] <%JJCheeker> Maybe he was gonna live at the station
[1:17:51] <SoFarFetched> Birdy....birdy mirdy HMMM
[1:17:52] <+Verd_254> Maybe he was just out of town on the outskirts or was going to move.
[1:17:52] <deadredeyez> sounds like a donation name lol
[1:17:53] <+JWhite0920> im new to RE2, it feels like Pat is rushing through. or is this normal speed?
[1:17:53] <%AirlineFood74> @TheEnablerr It's because of Irons' fat evil
[1:17:54] <%rdark_ksu> @TeraMercier Ah i was unaware. Thank you
[1:17:54] <%RaikenTB> Leon was a new hire in response to the mansion incident.
[1:17:54] <tank7013> @Meekest Do they do transfers fresh out of training?
[1:17:55] <CookieCutter007> FOR THE KIDS
[1:17:56] <Gruhunchously> It's a cosplay that he got before joining the force.
[1:17:58] <$Chimeraelite> I mean thats what Im doin.._
[1:17:59] <%DirtyGaijin> My head canon was that he was straight out of the Academy and moving to Raccoon city
[1:17:59] <reonome> SHUTUP
[1:18:00] <+chaumiester> That's actually quite normal. You get assigned where you get assigned as a Law Enforcement
[1:18:00] <JoshyJ> because UMBRELLA
[1:18:01] <%ToxInjection> Maybe he'd move? Like when NBA players move cities when they change teams
[1:18:01] <%AirlineFood74> BECAUSE FAT EVIL
[1:18:01] <%TombstoneTTromboners> chief irons
[1:18:03] <%lewdskeletor13> That’s not that weird
[1:18:04] <Youwereeatenbyalid> MUSEUM
[1:18:05] <%Agent_For_Hire> @AngriestPat Have you upgraded the magnum to get a free reload yet?
[1:18:05] <+Blackgaver> because why not!!
[1:18:05] <Dieworc> Thats actually common cops move to different towns for better pay conditions ect
[1:18:05] <valentinostand> its RAD
[1:18:05] <jj_cabo> Shut up doe
[1:18:06] <%TeraMercier> It's a really cool detail, rdark
[1:18:07] <+harpsichord_uiy> people join the military all the time to leave home, why not the police too
[1:18:07] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat Pat they give you the uniform after graduating the academy. Also its really common to work in different town because your family and friends arn't in that town preventing conflict of interest.
[1:18:07] <DIOandTheWorld> Well the secret passages could ahve been commissioned by Umbrella
[1:18:08] <%ElenaManetta> I've seen people commute from upstate New York to Connecticut go to their job in Manhattan
[1:18:08] <+Tadashi047> Umbrella did it
[1:18:08] <+HoloToast> because this was made in 1998 Kappa
[1:18:09] <%hamborhger> Just larp until you get hired
[1:18:09] <$HentaiSenpai9K> Gotta get work where you can
[1:18:09] <Ion_LaserX> SHUT UP THOUGH
[1:18:10] <+tigerfang86> SHUT UP CAUSE UMBRELLA
[1:18:11] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> All the cops I knew never worked in the city they lived in
[1:18:11] <OwlLightningMage> A lot of RE lore is just shut up LUL
[1:18:11] <gustavozxd> Annette is voiced by nanako
[1:18:12] <+tigerfang86> basically
[1:18:12] <%RandyBobandy72> Illuminati confirmed
[1:18:13] <%BoboDaHobo> Because you go to academy but the local City aint hiring
[1:18:13] <+Lolo27234> he could have gotten transfured over due to the need of more cops
[1:18:16] <%hamborhger> it just werks
[1:18:19] <PROUD2beGINGER> Because the residence is EVIL
[1:18:19] <dukenux> STFU UMBRELLA DID IT
[1:18:20] <Gruhunchously> The crazy dude was right.
[1:18:21] <@PlagueOfGripes> why doesn't your house have secret passages
[1:18:22] <$megamonmon123> because UMBRELLA
[1:18:23] <%Pilzkun> @AngriestPat don't you live in montreal? Isn't that an old city with secret passages everywhere?
[1:18:23] <Scorian> Why are the remaining STARS members not around?
[1:18:24] <green_tall_trees> he was transferred like in hotfuzz, Leon was so good he was making the other officers look bad
[1:18:24] <bigdumbidiotguy> I like to think that Irons had the place renovated to fit Umbrellas needs. it seems that NEST has been there for years and years
[1:18:25] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> Plebs don't know about the secrert passages in museums.
[1:18:25] <The_Blumper> @AngriestPat I heard cops don't want to serve in the same city they live in incase they see someone they just so happened to arrest a week ago
[1:18:26] <HyperionXV> Maybe the museum was made by the same folks who made the mansion.
[1:18:26] <dukenux> WE DO IT
[1:18:29] <Gruhunchously> Elliot was genre savvy.
[1:18:30] <PSI_Guy95> The police station used to be a museum and the museum was built out of a haunted castle and the haunted castle had secret passages for satanic rituals OK
[1:18:32] <count_itachi> @angriestpat is my spirit animal
[1:18:33] <%lewdskeletor13> RE Lore: JUST SHUT UP
[1:18:33] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @PlagueOfGripes bold of you to assume it doesn't
[1:18:33] <+PhysicsLB> the greenest herb
[1:18:36] <+Spikyshrike> @PlagueOfGripes How do you know it doesn't??
[1:18:37] <SoFarFetched> Can just imagine the guy asks the architecture, "Yeah can you like make the police station have a SHIT LOAD of puzzles? Just for the hell of it?"
[1:18:38] <%TeraMercier> Leon may have trained in a different, larger city and been transferred
[1:18:38] <%hamborhger> RE in paris with catacombs when
[1:18:38] <+Blackgaver> hmmmmm heeerb
[1:18:39] <jacksawjack> Originally the uniform was supplied to him and he changed into it at a Motel after his binge drinking episode due a fight with his GF at the time.
[1:18:40] <$megamonmon123> any stupid plothole? because UMBRELLA
[1:18:40] <bigdumbidiotguy> umbrella has been paying Irons for a long time
[1:18:40] <+Devilbringer133> Need some way for irons to get there
[1:18:42] <dukenux> dank wod
[1:18:42] <+crazzy294> The curse its cursed
[1:18:44] <Buka_Zero> give marvin a first aid spray
[1:18:45] <%ConquestBoogaloo> Every time you want to use the break room you need to gather medallions.
[1:18:46] <Kitty_Maid> been playing both the B scenarios, odd hearing Marvin's voice again lol
[1:18:47] <%PalmtopNami> wait how do you do the boss fights with just a knife?!?!
[1:18:48] <42nfl19> So legit, how does he get his uniform in Leon A if he does not start outside?
[1:18:48] <PROUD2beGINGER> Inhale good plant
[1:18:48] <+Blackgaver> was probably a bunch of parsley herb
[1:18:51] <devanmuse> Pat, if you had the money/resources, would you install RE style secret puzzle passages in your house?
[1:18:54] <OwlLightningMage> They wouldn't be secret passages if we knew about them
[1:18:54] <%hamborhger> @Spikyshrike that's why they're secret
[1:18:56] <+HoloToast> did you know that the plants in Coca Cola came from the Arklay mountains? That's why it's so good!!
[1:18:58] <Vohs_Bru> Had the same designer as the Spencer estate
[1:19:01] <%MyDarkStorm> So Pat Question Do the Tyrants have a Hyper Regain If not How is mr X Is Still ALIVE?!
[1:19:02] <Yummy_Nukes> musium literally have secret passages irl though
[1:19:07] <$megamonmon123> 1 hour speed run confirmed
[1:19:07] <sdgundum990> Hey Pat. Just saying, don't play Kingdom Hearts or else Woolie might announce that the stream is cancelled.
[1:19:08] <%connos_livereview> i hope he gets stomped for overconfidence
[1:19:08] <+Spikyshrike> @PalmtopNami Verrrry carefully
[1:19:08] <+Robopengy> Hey guys, R-Truth took the belt off of Nakamura
[1:19:09] <vedammi> im about to inhale good plant
[1:19:09] <PSI_Guy95> Every time you take a shit you need to find the 3 sacred amulets to open the rest room door
[1:19:10] <lesbianmimikyu> @AngriestPat Do you think you can get through both scenarios tonight?
[1:19:13] <%AirlineFood74> @Scorian Chris and Barry are hunting down Euro Umbrella off the top of my head. Wesker's doing the huge evil after chris stuffed him in a locker and made fun of his tyrants
[1:19:13] <bigdumbidiotguy> this is supported by the Knights Construction Company doing work in the sewers
[1:19:13] <+Talbz> @AngriestPat I just realised that the layout of the lobby is almost exactly the same as the mansion in RE1
[1:19:14] <SoFarFetched> @devanmuse He'd get locked out of his house more often then Kappa
[1:19:15] <invisi_bliss> this kind of sounds a bit like The Room theme
[1:19:15] <dukenux> Any plothole in RE can be explained by "the virus did it"
[1:19:20] <%DirtyGaijin> lol Pat would put a Shadow puzzle on his red bull and sweets supply to stop paige from throwing it out
[1:19:20] <evbites> maybe in it was an exhibit or where they stored all the stuff that could get easily stolen at night
[1:19:22] <@PlagueOfGripes> still don't know what the ruby is for
[1:19:22] <%TeraMercier> Pat would hide his sleeping mask in an RE medallion puzzle during the day
[1:19:23] <%JJCheeker> you should do hardcore some time
[1:19:25] <vingadivo> WR pace
[1:19:26] <%ElenaManetta> Is that significant?
[1:19:26] <jacksawjack> Apparently if you shoot off X's hat he gets more aggressive.
[1:19:28] <reddeadwine1277> When a fictional place has passages and compartments, they call it "cool". When I try to put in the same shit at my place, I get a visit from very rude men in black suits. So unfair.
[1:19:30] <$megamonmon123> how many viruses are there in the resident evil series
[1:19:31] <TheEnablerr> @AirlineFood74 I can just imagine Umbrella's finance department calling Irons constantly to say "the fuck did you commission now!? Why!?"
[1:19:33] <DIOandTheWorld> Her?
[1:19:33] <CrazyGunMan100> @angriestpat remember you can combine on pickup
[1:19:34] <%hamborhger> why is this the most important cutscene
[1:19:34] <%Laecerelius> You will learn, Plague!

[1:19:43] <KeystoneA1> @PlagueOfGripes It's for a box you find in a room.

[1:19:57] <CrazyGunMan100> there are hinges and balljoints
[1:19:57] <+harpsichord_uiy> @Paige they're probably plastic, since the other hand just popped on
[1:19:57] <%GrugOfWar> How does Mr.X give it to ya? it's a video game
[1:19:57] <evbites> joints,possession
[1:19:58] <%Fenrirlives> It had movable joints tho

[1:20:05] <OwlLightningMage> We need a Shut up Emote LUL
[1:20:06] <bigdumbidiotguy> actually paige, in the description for the red book it says the book is plastic. I'm assuming the statue may be plastic as well.
[1:20:08] <%hamborhger> It's fine
[1:20:09] <%connos_livereview> thats a paige
[1:20:10] <Hydrapissed> "because shut up "
[1:20:11] <%AirlineFood74> @TheEnablerr "It's for security! File it under expenses!"
[1:20:12] <+Blackgaver> THEY ALL DOO
[1:20:14] <%Typhaeon> I would go to more museums if they had secret passages
[1:20:17] <%mostundesired> Shit, you're right.
[1:20:17] <+Blackgaver> Kappa
[1:20:17] <Hydrapissed> They all do actually

[1:20:18] <+tigerfang86> I DONT
[1:20:19] <OwlLightningMage> patShutUp
[1:20:20] <%Codemaster7777> Because Umbrella
[1:20:20] <matrignomy7> THATS TRUE
[1:20:20] <righteousjam> havent you seen Night at the Museum guys!?!?
[1:20:21] <+tigerfang86> I DONT THO
[1:20:22] <ProRJHunter> It might though
[1:20:22] <puhff> it's true
[1:20:23] <%DirtyGaijin> Ive seen national treasure
[1:20:24] <+asgard147> 🤔
[1:20:25] <Gameslayer2> I hope it does
[1:20:25] <%PalmtopNami> it doea
[1:20:26] <%Laecerelius> It's to run from all of the exhibits coming to life!
[1:20:26] <+FrostMass22> You don't understand, Chief Irons NEEDS to hide a red jewel behind a painting
[1:20:26] <Youwereeatenbyalid> It's the MET, so it probably does
[1:20:27] <+ForteBlade> IT'S SECRET
[1:20:28] <%AirlineFood74> NOT OPTIMAL
[1:20:28] <%ToneBacas> gotta check it out
[1:20:28] <%Wallabri> that's what makes them SECRET
[1:20:28] <puhff> u don't know
[1:20:29] <dukenux> YOU DONT KNOOOOW
[1:20:29] <Yukasmarvin> It might, but it would be less cool for sure
[1:20:29] <garbageheaphound> thats true
[1:20:30] <Vohs_Bru> Paige has a secret passage
[1:20:32] <+BloodborneSammich> No u
[1:20:32] <PROUD2beGINGER> Secret passage to dat aas
[1:20:33] <valentinostand> geez i love this game hope re3 grts same treatment i wanna see what Jill Will look like
[1:20:33] <C_S_N_G> But are they puzzle secrets?
[1:20:33] <%lewdskeletor13> SHUT UP should be an emote
[1:20:33] <IsaiahOmega> Pat wouldn't install the puzzles in his house, he'd never be able to get anywhere in his house without a guide book.
[1:20:37] <jestrfestr> poor claire just standing at that gate
[1:20:38] <Xaxas115> dosent the museum in The Relic have a secret passage?
[1:20:39] <%ConquestBoogaloo> Everyone would go to museums more if they had secret passages.
[1:20:41] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Speed run ruined
[1:20:42] <deadredeyez> every library has lions by them right
[1:20:42] <%ThePuddingDead> I think the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York actually HAS a passage way built in it's underground
[1:20:43] <xchaikagaz> LUL LUL LUL
[1:20:44] <Idon__> beep beep!
[1:20:45] <%commanderclaw> It's optimal for pat's goblolins
[1:20:47] <Gruhunchously> @Typhaeon How do you know which museums have secret passage and which don't?
[1:20:48] <@PlagueOfGripes> wrong warp to the shotgun
[1:20:48] <%connos_livereview> i wish the shotgun was better
[1:20:48] <Hydrapissed> Beep
[1:20:50] <+tigerfang86> STEEL BOY
[1:20:51] <Hydrapissed> Bwap
[1:20:52] <$megamonmon123> shotgun seems super important in alot of runs
[1:20:54] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @Vohs_Bru Paige has a passage alright, but it certainly isn't a secret
[1:20:55] <jacksawjack> The Museum has secret passages for X to gon get to you so he can gon give it to you.
[1:20:57] <dukenux> Kreygasm
[1:20:58] <SoFarFetched> Each SFX punches you right in the Nostalgia
[1:20:59] <+Blackgaver> re7 engine wow

[1:21:05] <%ThatGuyfromMars> is pat using the infinite knife
[1:21:06] <TheEnablerr> @AirlineFood74 a fucking safe under the floorboards would make more sense and be more secure than half of this bullshit
[1:21:08] <%connos_livereview> steel boi steel boi
[1:21:09] <Nighthawkmun> Sound is integral
[1:21:10] <bigdumbidiotguy> the soundtrack implemented works very well in nearly every spot. just wait until you get to the morgue
[1:21:12] <%TeraMercier> Which STARS officer put their fucking badge in a box and then removed it's jewel and stuck it on a statue?
[1:21:12] <%DirtyGaijin> The shotty only get sort of ok after the upgrades
[1:21:14] <valentinostand> so far which you like playing more Leon ab or Clair ab
[1:21:16] <Antecursor> I think the shotgun looks way cooler without the stock
[1:21:17] <%ElenaManetta> "I get nostalgic over hearing these old nostalgic sounds" Pat is truly wise
[1:21:17] <Idon__> They need to patch this game to add Mr X busting through walls
[1:21:17] <%lewdskeletor13> @thatguyfrommars Nope
[1:21:18] <SoFarFetched> He's using Infinity Blade Works???
[1:21:19] <evbites> licker suck on leon's playthrough
[1:21:21] <%hamborhger> shotgun is super important in all runs
[1:21:24] <%ThatGuyfromMars> thanks @lewdskeletor13
[1:21:26] <Cleric4gg> This lockers could have been a zapping mechanic
[1:21:28] <+HoloToast> just like real life!

[1:21:29] <Xaxas115> TeraMercier Wesker

[1:21:29] <%Remery_> Lewd
[1:21:32] <%stoicman90> brad vickers
[1:21:33] <%AirlineFood74> @TheEnablerr yeah but secret passages and color-coded keys tho
[1:21:33] <bigdumbidiotguy> the final bosses the original soundtrack isn't so great.
[1:21:34] <JoshyJ> shoty is great for just destroying lickers
[1:21:34] <$megamonmon123> @hamborhger not knife only
[1:21:36] <%connos_livereview> 50 percent chance on base 90 on upgraded
[1:21:38] <dukenux> thats hot
[1:21:39] <xchaikagaz> Time to shoot some Zombies
[1:21:40] <deadredeyez> sometimes it just blows the skin off
[1:21:44] <+thewaifoo> X GON GIVE IT TO YA
[1:21:45] <reonome> WOW
[1:21:45] <+BizarreRevolver> Has Pat heard about the Claire cuck meme?
[1:21:48] <%ThePuddingDead> Sir? you ok?
[1:21:49] <missingangle> Don't worry 'bout it!
[1:21:50] <+Blackgaver> helicopter just hit the police station... DOUCEMENT
[1:21:52] <+HoloToast> I hope no one ever lifts that helicopter up
[1:21:52] <+PhysicsLB> ALL THIS HERB
[1:21:53] <Gruhunchously> Whoops. Was Pat flying it?
[1:21:54] <%ElenaManetta> So THAT doesn't explode on impact
[1:21:54] <a_mad_dragon> i still say that sounds more like a prop plane
[1:21:54] <reddeadwine1277> smoke that thing yo
[1:21:57] <%Fenrirlives> why does that Helicopter crash tho?

[1:21:59] <person181> clair
[1:22:00] <bigdumbidiotguy> the final Super Tyrant fight sounds so much more amazing with the new soundtrack
[1:22:00] <%ElenaManetta> But the cars WHICH ARE PROVEN NOT TO EXPLODE do
[1:22:01] <%GeneralSCPatton> And here is approximately when Scenario B begins

[1:36:27] <%nmaten> FACE // OFF
[1:36:27] <+miguelrod777> jesus plague lol
[1:36:27] <Renuarb> Marvin is an asshole. Why didn't he shoot himself if he knew he was a lost cause? Instead he lets himself become a zombie obstacle
[1:36:27] <%joylent_blue> if that what you're into
[1:36:28] <Sinister_Aglet> alexa play despacito
[1:36:29] <lionmanguy> It feels a bit worse when leon can take tons of gameplay bites and just walk it off

[1:36:44] <Shwepie> @vindaxxv Because of the Zapping System™!
[1:36:44] <Gruhunchously> @Renuarb Maybe he couldn't go through with it?
[1:36:46] <%Remery_> Hopefully Marvin becomes a Ass-eating zombie :)
[1:36:46] <vextalyst> seriously tho pat gets paige a pearl necklace and no one goes "Gigity" am i the only childish one here?

[1:43:48] <DIOandTheWorld> @AngriestPat you're missing out by not playing hardcore, the game is definitely designed around it

[1:44:30] <bigdumbidiotguy> @AngriestPat heres a tip; if you stand far away from the G-embryo and shoot them you can run by them as they rise out of the poop water
[1:44:32] <%TeraMercier> Leon's hair in this one looks the most like a real human and not an anime
[1:44:37] <%ElenaManetta> yOU BEAT THE GAME 4 TIMES
[1:44:37] <Cleric4gg> Are you doing Kh3?
[1:44:37] <%Luna_Ashford> @AngriestPat Just a heads up, not sure if you know this, Claire's revolver has a higher crit chance so it more than makes up for its 5 rounds max

[1:45:04] <%ThatGuyfromMars> leon never changed his hairstyle, he keeps it to his 40s and he still looks good with it
[1:45:04] <reddeadwine1277> "My neck, my back, hang these pouches 'round my crack"
[1:45:05] <+G_Thunders> @mastertwin2 kind of, but it’s way easier taking out a leg and just letting them crawl the rest of the game
[1:45:07] <%Trabnaxes> New Challenge run: No knife
[1:45:09] <$HentaiSenpai9K> What about Ghost Survivor?
[1:45:10] <%TeraMercier> Claire's revolver also allows you to move with pinpoint aim once you're centered
[1:45:12] <hntronium> @smargh1015 He beat it on accident apparently
[1:45:12] <%AncelDeLambert> gotta save that Hardcore run for Halloween
[1:45:14] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @ElenaManetta iS THIS THE DISCORD TECH TO COUNTER MOOBOT?
[1:45:16] <DIOandTheWorld> He hasnt died in hours and thinks he isn't ready for Hardcore LUL
[1:45:17] <+Talbz> Why does Claire get 3 pistols?
[1:45:23] <+HoloToast> Did you check the weekly challenges at all?
[1:45:23] <%Toynota10> @AngriestPat What would you want in RE8?
[1:45:27] <mastermidget23> @Angriestpat I know you're not using it this run, but you did unlock the infinite samurai edge right?
[1:45:28] <%lewdskeletor13> Men in an outfit get me all hot and bothered KappaPride
[1:45:29] <42nfl19> So how does he have a Samurai Edge? S rank from previous run @AngriestPat
[1:45:31] <$Dotta5> Where's Poochi?
[1:45:33] <Gruhunchously> JUST capitalize EVERY second WORD
[1:45:37] <%bestwaifuritsu> Why is there no bow gun
[1:45:38] <reddeadwine1277> Someone stomps the lid down on Leon's head
[1:45:38] <%willjar313> Oh wow. @AngriestPat has more viewers than StreamFourStar.
[1:45:39] <%Agent_For_Hire> apatBig lobosReset
[1:45:41] <red_blaster> What's the point of the secret passage if it just goes to the parking lot?
[1:45:41] <+Blackgaver> DOGE
[1:45:43] <+zaworldo> BORF BORF

[1:51:06] <DIOandTheWorld> Good, completely irrelevant plot that doesn't need to exist
[1:51:06] <Desertfishing> that look
[1:51:06] <DarkKnightGrave> Streamline.
[1:51:08] <%Plague_Nurse> Cause it wasn't important
[1:51:08] <hoopray> because no sex in RE now
[1:51:08] <+PenmanLupine> @AngriestPat FBI agent is a better cover than random reporter with a missing boyfriend
[1:51:09] <nina9669> who ks mr x anyway?

[1:51:17] <GameXful2> she with the """""fbi"""" now, that's her new cover
[1:51:18] <+Punchasaur> Ada gave her trench coat to X
[1:51:18] <davejackman> @AngriestPat Would you be cool with a RE1 remake in this style?
[1:51:18] <%Corporate_Redeemer> DMX broke back into jail just to kill Ben
[1:51:19] <+Rust_Wick> leon want that booty
[1:51:20] <%JerithGeros> I think the FBI cover is a much better excuse than looking for your boyfriend
[1:51:20] <+tigerfang86> HE LOVES IT
[1:51:20] <$megamonmon123> ada was in re 1?
[1:51:21] <+Toblo1> I do like the shift from Ada being coy to Ada just being not-as-coy
[1:51:23] <%TeraMercier> No cockteasing if we know she's got some asshole stickin it oto her
[1:51:23] <%AirlineFood74> Mr X is a tyrant

[1:51:33] <bigbradish> Claire > Ada
[1:51:33] <%lewdskeletor13> The FBI thing is better
[1:51:34] <%FrostMass22> It wasn't ointless, it was her cover story to hide the fact she's a spy.
[1:51:34] <+PhysicsLB> PAT FOUND HIMSELF
[1:51:35] <%FracturedImage> No
[1:51:35] <+Neo_Antwon> ClappyHype ClappyHype ClappyHype

[1:51:36] <%DirtyGaijin> remake them all
[1:51:36] <%badmr7> Ada giving Leon the vapors
[1:51:37] <%mostundesired> Oof, that puzzle.
[1:51:37] <einSynd> Why isn't Ada an ADA
[1:51:41] <Huntercd> Her being FBI makes no sense
[1:51:42] <%AirlineFood74> Not actually named Mr X in any official capacity by Capcom themselves mind you
[1:51:42] <CptBritches> "I can't wait to cuck Claire for eternity with this Ada woman"
[1:51:43] <+AlopekisPup> Remake all the REs. :D
[1:51:44] <germanmafia23> @megamonmon123 She was a password in RE1 or something
[1:51:44] <reddeadwine1277> I know it'll fit somewhere around here
[1:51:44] <OwlLightningMage> Is her name even actually Ada? Has she been lying for decades? LUL
[1:51:45] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Another REmake 1 God....
[1:51:45] <%JerithGeros> Like if he's just a boyfriend... I wouldn't fight zombies for him
[1:51:45] <+8framelag> 1 is already good, fix CV
[1:51:45] <%NDHCemployee> Leon hates to see her go but loves to watch her walk away
[1:51:46] <kingbaconcrispy> There's no sex it that universe anyway.
[1:51:47] <gustavozxd> I want to say Leon's lucky, but he never got the big sex so idk
[1:51:47] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Remake of the remake that just came out
[1:51:47] <切捨御免> Leon's dumb one-liners are the best
[1:51:47] <%MakotoPB> I would like trench coat Ada if she didn't have the sunglasses. girl it's night time and craps dark
[1:51:48] <holis_crayolis> OUTBREAK REMAKE¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡
[1:51:48] <+Blackgaver> remake re1 remake?
[1:51:49] <TheEnablerr> RE-REMAKE2
[1:51:50] <bigdumbidiotguy> RE remake is good enough. it works fine even now
[1:51:51] <+NWR_James> REMAKE RE2 REMAKE
[1:51:52] <noahjpvd> Nut n' go bitch
[1:51:54] <DIOandTheWorld> @Huntercd she's lying...
[1:51:55] <$HentaiSenpai9K> @megamonmon123 Shes mentioned in memos in RE1
[1:51:56] <Gruhunchously> He splooshed himself hard.
[1:51:57] <breakerdsx> It happened so quick
[1:51:57] <%AirlineFood74> REMAKE 2 REMAKE
[1:51:58] <Yummy_Nukes> BIG sploosh
[1:51:58] <%TeraMercier> @AngriestPat Do you think there's enough actual shooty bang bang content to make RE1 last like this?
[1:51:58] <Hydrapissed> would they attempt a remake of Re4 @AngriestPat ??
[1:51:59] <Kitty_Maid> I wanna see 3 first though
[1:52:00] <AmericanaRed> More RE2
[1:52:01] <bigbradish> Is this Leon A or B?
[1:52:01] <%Agent_For_Hire> Cue the god hand "I Love It" audio
[1:52:02] <%ThatGuyfromMars> I remember Pat saying he was gonna be so mad if Remake 2 had this camera style
[1:52:03] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@payatanharkonnen) (warning)
[1:52:04] <%DirtyGaijin> i just want RE3 to be remade
[1:52:05] <Bamboo_Bushido> i don't need it personally
[1:52:05] <bigdumbidiotguy> preemptively kill the dogs in the kennels
[1:52:05] <%ShaneWhite> Guys Piranha Plant is awesome!
[1:52:06] <+Zerodyne90> remake all capcom games
[1:52:07] <%rumtumtugnutz> isn't this already an RE1 Remake style remake of this game?
[1:52:07] <%DirtyGaijin> which it is!
[1:52:08] <%templar010> @AngriestPat Will you do a classic camera playthrough?
[1:52:08] <%AirlineFood74> @bigbradish A
[1:52:09] <+HoloToast> if you're using the normal costume you can see where Leon's balls blew out after he met Ada
[1:52:10] <+Toblo1> @AngriestPat REmake 3 or REmake Code Veronica?
[1:52:11] <%joylent_blue> Leon A bigbradish
[1:52:11] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> That's the tipping point. No new games, just remake'ing remakes again and again
[1:52:11] <+lucidrush> Next is R3make
[1:52:11] <$Wafflum> Her cover in RE2 is that she's a completely normal civilian looking for her boyfriend who happens to be beasting her way through this apocalypse no problem. It's baffling
[1:52:14] <mastermidget23> This is one of the many, many times I find myself thinking of a different solution than an re protagonist. I'd be using a stick to yank Bens busted corpse over near the bars for that card.
[1:52:14] <GohanEgret> woolieVERGIN woolieVERGIN woolieVERGIN woolieVERGIN
[1:52:15] <%blubbins> Look at all these terrible parking jobs...
[1:52:17] <%Corporate_Redeemer> Remake this but in FIRST-PERSON
[1:52:17] <AmericanaRed> MORE LIKE. R3Make
[1:52:17] <Videogamer4> REmake operation racoon city Kappa
[1:52:18] <bigbradish> Thanks guys
[1:52:19] <+asgard147> monkaS
[1:52:20] <kingksywarp> is pat doing a speed run ?
[1:52:21] <$Wafflum> original, I mean
[1:52:22] <+8framelag> 3 would be easiest though they could reuse some of this
[1:52:24] <%AirlineFood74> kill the doggos
[1:52:25] <+AlopekisPup> There is in RE3 though
[1:52:25] <bardofurbellum> So why does X kill Ben?
[1:52:27] <%rumtumtugnutz> RE3make
[1:52:29] <Worldbrand> What about a silent hill, despite how impossible that would be?
[1:52:32] <%RogueCrocodile> @angriestpat are you ever gonna actually finish revelations 1?
[1:52:38] <bigdumbidiotguy> kill them
[1:52:40] <%AirlineFood74> @bardofurbellum because he knows about Tyrant and the fucked up umbrella stuff
[1:52:43] <Bamboo_Bushido> They should just remake all the bad RE games
[1:52:44] <%DirtyGaijin> yeah you murdered them for NO reason
[1:52:46] <%TeraMercier> REMake has a lovely tone, but there's not necessaritly enough in it
[1:52:51] <Desertfishing> ammo wasters
[1:52:52] <+8framelag> another speedrun tech
[1:52:52] <%ThatGuyfromMars> fuck
[1:52:52] <%mostundesired> Okay but you should kill them anyway.
[1:52:52] <garbageheaphound> its a trick
[1:52:52] <%templar010> @AngriestPat Will you do a classic camera playthrough?
[1:52:55] <%LogothX> "murder" they're already dead
[1:52:55] <%DirtyGaijin> just for the Thrill
[1:52:56] <OwlLightningMage> You Woolied those dogs for no reason
[1:52:56] <Gruhunchously> Pat continues to murder puppers
[1:52:56] <%connos_livereview> its a bait and switch
[1:52:57] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @bardofurbellum Same reason he goes after Hunk. Programed to eliminate all survivors
[1:52:57] <%Laecerelius> But you gain the power from snuffing puppers!
[1:53:01] <mastermidget23> Well I wasted bullets in both my playthroughs...
[1:53:01] <BestBrosPlay123> I can’t believe there are people who hate this game.
[1:53:01] <dragoon001914> REmake is perfect, and the mansion is small enough that going for over the shoulder camera wouldn't be great for it.
[1:53:02] <%derpumpkinking> hey pat, looking forward to your continued streams. got out of the hospital today and the bed rest requirements enable me to sit on my ass and play KH3 and listen to you in the background and nobody can say shit. good stuff. keep up the good work.
[1:53:08] <bardofurbellum> Thanks all!
[1:53:10] <%ElenaManetta> I thought it does
[1:53:10] <%TeraMercier> @templar010 There's currently only a concept mod for fixed camera
[1:53:10] <sukiyakiwestern> Finish what you were sayingg
[1:53:12] <SchroedingersFerret> An original RE1 style demake: make the original voice acting even worse.
[1:53:14] <%sobek399> I thought the 3 dogs would join the other dog ranks
[1:53:15] <%DirtyGaijin> pop door zomb
[1:53:16] <%templar010> Oh ri[
[1:53:18] <kingksywarp> hey guys if i may ask does the story acutally change in scenarios?
[1:53:18] <%templar010> rip
[1:53:21] <$megamonmon123> i thought it reduced the number of dogs that spawn
[1:53:23] <Laycas49> @AngriestPat Tofu run at any point?
[1:53:23] <SpydaMan_SLiM> I actually prefer RE1make to RE2make
[1:53:25] <Desertfishing> classic cam seems hard to do with how dark the game is now
[1:53:26] <bigdumbidiotguy> let's not retcon RE Remake. remake is fine and is great even with this remake.
[1:53:26] <%Prism_Wing> Holy fuck. Been playing KH3 for 7 hours straight and now I get some Pat Evil2 while I have a dinner HeyGuys
[1:53:27] <jacksawjack> Flashbang the dogs in the garage when you return with both parts for the puzzle. They despawn due to the cutscene.
[1:53:29] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @SchroedingersFerret man that's really tough
[1:53:30] <Shwepie> They don't disappear, they magically teleport out of their cages and result in more dogs in the hallways.
[1:53:32] <TerraWraith> Judging by this current pace, I gotta go in like 2 minutes
[1:53:35] <%AirlineFood74> @SchroedingersFerret Turn Chris' bullying of Wesker up to 20
[1:53:37] <$megamonmon123> @laycas49 he hasnt beaten hunk
[1:53:40] <mastermidget23> @SchroedingersFerret Clown fart the whole soundtrack!
[1:53:43] <%TombstoneTTromboners> someone's made a concept mod for fixed camera
[1:53:46] <darthriven501> !uptime
[1:53:46] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 53m.
[1:53:48] <OwlLightningMage> He did beat Hunk
[1:53:51] <Vohs_Bru> Has Paige already turned into the L-creature?
[1:53:51] <turth3> Pat finish your thought please what should they make after this
[1:53:52] <bigdumbidiotguy> @angriestpat you can only pull the Dimaond key out mostly and he wont wake up and you can collect the key
[1:53:54] <+8framelag> Zapping DLC PogChamp
[1:53:54] <%TeraMercier> @kingksywarp The cutscenes happen in A to B order, it features whichever character you have in each cutscene
[1:53:55] <Laycas49> @megamonmon123 Ohh that's exciting
[1:53:55] <+Blackgaver> EEW
[1:53:57] <%DirtyGaijin> Mr X seems to be the biggest difference
[1:53:57] <TheEnablerr> Zombie sympathists probably exist in this universe.
[1:53:58] <+Zerodyne90> mod better has tank controls
[1:54:02] <Yummy_Nukes> but where's the DONGLE key?
[1:54:04] <%ElenaManetta> I wonder if Pat would win in an RE2 trivia off
[1:54:05] <%RogueCrocodile> @angriestpat if I remember correctly you’ve never completed revelations 1 right?
[1:54:07] <$Dotta5> made that Alabama kush
[1:54:09] <mayorrev> someone made a classic camera mod as an experiment, did you see it? @angriestpat
[1:54:09] <+Toblo1> @AngriestPat Its mainly puzzle locations and Mr X appearing earlier, isn't it?
[1:54:09] <%connos_livereview> 2nd run is funner
[1:54:11] <%DirtyGaijin> he arrives sooner on part B
[1:54:17] <%TeraMercier> 2nd run skips the slow intro pretty nicely
[1:54:17] <+HoloToast> megamonmon123 he has actually, he was doing a "training run" for the stream and accidentally cleared it
[1:54:18] <+Talbz> Was the ending of this game changed from the original?
[1:54:19] <bigdumbidiotguy> @angriestpat dude won't wake up if you pull him out only most of the way
[1:54:22] <sukiyakiwestern> its also harder
[1:54:22] <+AccioSkullar> close the thing monkaS
[1:54:25] <DIOandTheWorld> Well B scenarios are also harder, since tyrant appears right at the start
[1:54:27] <%TeraMercier> It also cuts out large chunks of shared cutscenes
[1:54:29] <Gruhunchously> Nope

[1:54:45] <%TombstoneTTromboners> can't reach the key

[1:55:09] <%AirlineFood74> JUST KILL HIM NOW
[1:55:09] <%Corporate_Redeemer> SHOOT HIM
[1:55:11] <%lewdskeletor13> LEON CANT REACH
[1:55:11] <+AlopekisPup> Shoot him though
[1:55:12] <luminousTURQUOISEwater> Jebaited
[1:55:13] <+8framelag> he only wakes when you take it
[1:55:15] <cjsugar> frk
[1:55:15] <jacksawjack> The B scenarios are lazily done and really the only real gripe I have with the game...besides the enemy RNG.
[1:55:18] <%connos_livereview> can you shoost him ?
[1:55:18] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Leon has stubby Pat arms
[1:55:19] <%DirtyGaijin> @AngriestPat shoot him now
[1:55:21] <+Zerodyne90> SeemsGood
[1:55:22] <%Corporate_Redeemer> PULL THE TRIGGER
[1:55:23] <gustavozxd> there's literally no need to waste ammo on him
[1:55:26] <+AXL808> a little more... a little more... a little more...
[1:55:29] <%ElenaManetta> Holy shit Pat that turn around was so fucking fast
[1:55:31] <cjsugar> yraahhhhh
[1:55:32] <$Wafflum> The goofy part is that woman who flops around will not get up
[1:55:33] <bigdumbidiotguy> he didnt wake up lol

[1:55:37] <%FracturedImage> apatWrong 3
[1:55:37] <+HoloToast> leaving that one open, big mistake Kappa
[1:55:41] <%TeraMercier> I feel like the B scenario is mostly to experience the opposite set of weapons
[1:55:41] <%lewdskeletor13> 3
[1:55:42] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@Blackgaver) (warning)
[1:55:42] <+Alig200> you definitely can do it, just tried it on Leon B, just made sure to inch it out.

[1:55:51] <nicoleymcquack> I know its unlikely but how rad would a remake like this of classic silent hill games be??
[1:55:52] <+Blackgaver> blap blap blap blap
[1:55:54] <bennc60> that fire rate tho
[1:55:56] <%ElenaManetta> Oh I thought Pat just had lightning reflexes
[1:55:58] <%RogueCrocodile> The main problem I have with revelations 1 is the lack of co op that could have been easily added
[1:55:59] <%Corporate_Redeemer> Bang Bang Pull My Leon Triggdr
[1:56:00] <+Blackgaver> the gun go skraaa
[1:56:07] <+Punchasaur> Brrrrrap
[1:56:09] <+HoloToast> powder on shelf
[1:56:10] <%TeraMercier> Proper silent hill remakes could be incredible
[1:56:11] <+Alig200> @AngriestPat you can do it without him waking, but you have it inch it out very carefully and slowly.
[1:56:12] <Fujiwara_92> should've could've would've
[1:56:13] <%lewdskeletor13> Pat has goblin reflexes
[1:56:14] <%konekoryugamine> Oh SURE, Konami would INSTANTLY turn over and remake Silent Hill
[1:56:15] <%GohanEgret> apatFist apatFist apatFist
[1:56:16] <%Lion_kun> im trying to speed run claire a to get the infinite gun, i got to the sewers in 90 minutes, is that good time you think?
[1:56:17] <SpydaMan_SLiM> @AngriestPat What do you like better RE1make or RE2make?
[1:56:24] <%FrostMass22> I think anything other than fixed camera angles would ruin any Silent Hill game
[1:56:29] <+sham_> Just finished claire b. This game is fucking great, god damn.
[1:56:37] <%DirtyGaijin> Konami make too much money on the big gambles now
[1:56:41] <+neo_cosmos> 134
[1:56:44] <$megamonmon123> the b scenarios are not merciful

[1:56:50] <%sobek399> two right ones
[1:56:50] <%konekoryugamine> Konami actively will RUIN you
[1:56:53] <kingksywarp> so does anyone know why the shotgun is so nerfed in this game like i headshot one and it wasnt even a insta kill at close range
[1:56:54] <%AncelDeLambert> turn them on one by one and then MATH

[1:57:04] <+cannondrill1> @Lion_kun what difficulty are you on? the grade for high ranks and unlockables changes based on difficulty
[1:57:04] <%ElenaManetta> Everytime I hear that CLANG I just think of Conkers Bad Fury Day
[1:57:04] <%TeraMercier> @FrostMass22 You make a good point. Those games are also really contingent on hiding the environment with very specific levels of visibility

[1:59:49] <%DirtyGaijin> @OwlLightningMage drop that bomb owl
[1:59:49] <kingbaconcrispy> dogs are underwhelming

[1:59:49] <%lewdskeletor13> TELL US Owl
[1:59:50] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 2 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 8oz (240mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.

[1:59:59] <%TeraMercier> @AncelDeLambert Stocked handguns are a legit thing that are useful in close quarter situations. Though my info on that is heavily shaped by resident evil
[2:00:00] <jacksawjack> You don't have to kill the garage puppers if you just wait until you have both parts.
[2:00:02] <+Blackgaver> @quodo45 fuckin never LUL

[2:00:12] <%konekoryugamine> Looked it up. Fallout 76 had a patch come up today
[2:00:13] <%DirtyGaijin> Do you think Fallout 76 is like a social experiment
[2:00:13] <%GohanEgret> @TerraWraith Kappa

[2:00:38] <%TeraMercier> @AncelDeLambert The Beretta M93R is a burst fire handgun featured in RE5 that's available in limited amounts to police forces
[2:00:39] <Ion_LaserX> A patch that reintroduces old bugs? That sounds like Bethesda alright
[2:00:41] <%lewdskeletor13> Night Fist
[2:00:41] <OwlLightningMage> Fallout 76 is the gift that keeps on giving LUL
[2:00:41] <%superxinvader> what's the new 76 news?

[2:01:29] <+G_Thunders> I got 76 for half off. Played it after the patch today and people are just making shit up. No bugs reintroduced on PS4
[2:01:31] <%ElenaManetta> Was that a scream?

[2:01:42] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 1m.
[2:01:43] <+zaworldo> DOES X APPROACHETH
[2:01:43] <Gruhunchously> Why does Fallout 76 still exist? It's probably hurting Bethesda more than helping them.
[2:01:44] <%DirtyGaijin> @Wafflum Leon doesn't get Irons office tho
[2:01:44] <%walternatorz> ASMR stream of just menu sounds for 10 hours
[2:01:49] <Guardiansaiyan> WOW I am late...
[2:01:52] <OwlLightningMage> I hope Fallout 76 never stops being a trash fire LUL
[2:01:53] <+alexth3gr3at> Now I really can't wait to get RE 2
[2:01:55] <$punkthepsychopenguin> Wait a minute. This isn't Kingdom Hearts 3.
[2:02:01] <%connos_livereview> claires elza walker outfit is the shit
[2:02:04] <+psithen> nostalgia go up but intended experience go down
[2:02:07] <%mastertwin2> 76 has GOT to be some kind of long-con by Godd Coward
[2:02:10] <+Slice_of_Kris> for the shutter where guy got choped inhalf
[2:02:12] <%Agent_For_Hire> OG game sounds make my iron become the big iron
[2:02:13] <+Blackgaver> pat come on LUL
[2:02:19] <%konekoryugamine> I'm looking at the official Patch notes right now
[2:02:21] <%konekoryugamine> This has to be good
[2:02:21] <%mitchteck> @angriestpat why don’t the green herbs work sometimes
[2:02:22] <ScreamingMeat> Pat not rotating his saves? oof
[2:02:22] <Guardiansaiyan> @punkthepsychopenguin Sora had a selfie with Mister X upstairs, just wait...
[2:02:22] <Predatorhahaha23000> let f76 be free to play so I do not need to but it Kappa

[2:02:24] <+HoloToast> that one Kappa
[2:02:25] <Naho_Saenoki> RIP Elliot.
[2:02:25] <%DirtyGaijin> that one
[2:02:27] <bigdumbidiotguy> the last window
[2:02:28] <Fujiwara_92> second and 4th
[2:02:29] <%TeraMercier> When you turn on the nostalgia noises, the intended experience is nostalgia
[2:02:30] <TheAspiringWriter> @angriestpat Fallout 76 JUST released a patch that’s apparently fucking up the game and Bethesda is damage controlling the fuck out of it by DELETING complaints
[2:02:32] <+neo_cosmos> how long do you think its ganna take for 76 to go f2p chat?
[2:02:33] <$punkthepsychopenguin> @mastertwin2 it's a money laundering scheme.
[2:02:37] <dekkitout> fo76 is almost definitely some long con
[2:02:38] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @Yummy_Nukes Claire gets this room too
[2:02:41] <Videogamer4> LUL
[2:02:42] <%DirtyGaijin> gooey
[2:02:43] <$punkthepsychopenguin> Isn't it already f2p?
[2:02:47] <TheAspiringWriter> From what I hear
[2:02:47] <+LethalPlacebo> Why does Pat shoot them in the chest like that?
[2:02:48] <$megamonmon123> you wanna barracade all of them though
[2:02:49] <theTrapWizard> 3 farthest from steps
[2:02:50] <$Wafflum> @DirtyGaijin Yeah, but he never does. Just like how Claire never gets that pathway from the basement to here, but Claire B can just come here anyway.
[2:02:50] <%superxinvader> probably that one
[2:02:51] <$punkthepsychopenguin> Wait you had to pay money to play 76?
[2:02:53] <+Blackgaver> blat blat blat.. pow
[2:02:53] <+HoloToast> hey look, it's Elliot's legs
[2:02:55] <+valkuma> @AngriestPat you get enough barricades to do every single window (even in hardcore)
[2:02:56] <bigdumbidiotguy> I wish they had included the wire and fuse box
[2:02:57] <%AncelDeLambert> has anyone done any workshops yet to determine if center mass is as good as headshots in this game?
[2:02:57] <TheEnablerr> I say 2 more months
[2:02:59] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @LethalPlacebo
[2:03:01] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> oops
[2:03:02] <%TeraMercier> Fallout 76 is still definitely full priced in many places
[2:03:05] <Beef_Broganoff> My KH3 preorder got screwed up so I'm still playing and watching RE2 instead at the same time instead lmao
[2:03:07] <ScreamingMeat> Officer Stumpy returns

[2:03:15] <切捨御免> YOU BASTARD
[2:03:15] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Headshot don't mean much, body shots work just as well
[2:03:17] <germanmafia23> Hang in there Elliot!
[2:03:18] <bigdumbidiotguy> @anceldelambert in hardcore, leg shots are better than headshots
[2:03:20] <Yummy_Nukes> @thatguyfrommars ah okay thanks
[2:03:22] <%superxinvader> I miss the pools of blood
[2:03:24] <%TeraMercier> Headshots just stagger reliably
[2:03:25] <+HoloToast> Walk if off Elliot !!
[2:03:28] <%DirtyGaijin> its sometimes better to cripple them
[2:03:33] <Gruhunchously> What the...
[2:03:36] <dukenux> What tha?
[2:03:41] <+LethalPlacebo> @Sphincter_Spelunker Really? The headshots still seem to do more damage even if they don't put them down?
[2:03:45] <+AccioSkullar> ! ammo at risk !
[2:03:46] <%Aztec50> a well placed grenade as you find these guys is great
[2:03:47] <Gruhunchously> What the ADA WAIT
[2:03:50] <TerraWraith> Literally eating that dude's ass around the corner. It's a shame his legs by themselves didn't get zombified
[2:03:55] <KeystoneA1> Those janitor zombies in the overalls are fucking tanks, even in Standard.
[2:03:55] <Vohs_Bru> @AngriestPat Would you do a classic RE 1 steam just for the LULZ? you love it
[2:03:57] <%TombstoneTTromboners> elliot you ok
[2:03:57] <mojokingizakku> Zombies are essentially mini Mr.X with the amount of damage they can take
[2:03:59] <PROUD2beGINGER> Hey buddy
[2:03:59] <+Blackgaver> boy he looks good
[2:04:01] <%DirtyGaijin> stop picking of the crippled pat

[2:04:03] <%AncelDeLambert> woah, there, stumpy, maybe just stay down
[2:04:04] <%TeraMercier> I'd fucking love if his legs walked around
[2:04:05] <PSI_Guy95> Zombified legs? oh no evil pant

[2:04:21] <KenKhaoz> oh did he beat it?
[2:04:21] <+The_monster_hunter> zombies take way too much to die sometimes
[2:04:22] <SpydaMan_SLiM> Elliot is half the Zombie Brad was lol

[2:04:25] <%TeraMercier> Shotgun him
[2:04:27] <+Blackgaver> sir SIR
[2:04:27] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @LethalPlacebo For the amount of bullets you end up using, might as well just down them and move on
[2:04:27] <Yummy_Nukes> elliot pls
[2:04:30] <Gruhunchously> You have the right to remain DEAD
[2:04:31] <%DirtyGaijin> Pat finally fighting someone his own size
[2:04:33] <%AncelDeLambert> LUL at the ricochet sounds from the knife
[2:04:35] <$Wafflum> You can't say he didn't give it an honest try
[2:04:36] <Predatorhahaha23000> S t o p R e s i s t i n g
[2:04:38] <42nfl19> that means the otehr zombie is eating the booty
[2:04:40] <+Alig200> @negawrecka just slashing like, it lasts a decent amount of time, if you regularly use it to break out of grabs, very quickly
[2:04:41] <PSI_Guy95> @DirtyGaijin ehehehhe LUL
[2:04:41] <KahtaLzargo> Pat, I bet the sounds aren’t as much nostalgia as getting to play the zapping system again.
[2:04:43] <Beef_Broganoff> Which difficulty is this?
[2:04:43] <+LethalPlacebo> @Sphincter_Spelunker I see.
[2:04:43] <FoghornLeghornII> @dekkitout booooooo

[2:04:56] <+LethalPlacebo> @Beef_Broganoff standard
[2:04:56] <Guardiansaiyan> ALL the Ass
[2:04:56] <+HoloToast> that zombie eating out like his undead life depends on it is so goofy I love it
[2:04:58] <bigdumbidiotguy> did anyone else see the video of the 2 Mr. X running around? game was obviously hacked, but it was spooki
[2:04:58] <dekkitout> oh you were thinking it too
[2:05:00] <DarkKnightGrave> Still eating ass
[2:05:05] <%Aztec50> x bout to give it to ya
[2:05:06] <%TombstoneTTromboners> that guy will be eating ass for the rest of his days
[2:05:07] <%AncelDeLambert> man, look at those nasty gashes on Leon's neck
[2:05:08] <Beef_Broganoff> Cool cool, I haven't tried Hardcore yet tbh
[2:05:12] <%DirtyGaijin> only in B
[2:05:13] <TheEnablerr> zombies really go for the neck and ass. the SUPPLE meats
[2:05:14] <DarkKnightGrave> Eating Ass in 1998.
[2:05:15] <%DirtyGaijin> i think
[2:05:16] <Guardiansaiyan> @Totally_not_toby Nice
[2:05:16] <PROUD2beGINGER> Let's go to the lobby
[2:05:19] <%konekoryugamine> OKay, I looked at the Fallout 76 patch notes: 1500 lb weight limit, 20-40-60 damage ratio, recipes and plans in vendors are no longer randomized, PvP Hunter/Hunted got fixed, they fixed some exploits for duplication of blueprints and items, and as an added note the Vendor and Recipes now cost more
[2:05:23] <$megamonmon123> the mr x timer is counting down
[2:05:23] <KenKhaoz> so this is B?
[2:05:26] <+HoloToast> big dead ends
[2:05:27] <gustavozxd> flame zombies disappear from there after a while
[2:05:28] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Leon A
[2:05:29] <%Totally_not_toby> @Guardiansaiyan ;)
[2:05:31] <bigdumbidiotguy> the flame zombies despawn after a certain amount of time
[2:05:31] <%DirtyGaijin> this is LEON A
[2:05:34] <ovan20> @KenKhaoz A
[2:05:37] <+Punchasaur> Flombies
[2:05:51] <+AccioSkullar> ohhhh this a good
[2:05:51] <bigdumbidiotguy> @angriestpat youee good for now. how many statues do you have already?
[2:05:52] <%DirtyGaijin> Leon A-DA wait
[2:05:53] <+HoloToast> the most annoying item in the world
[2:05:56] <Beef_Broganoff> I'm doing my third run myself rn, Claire A Leon B
[2:06:01] <%kiiiirsten> His hat!
[2:06:02] <+Blackgaver> bald zombie
[2:06:03] <%TombstoneTTromboners> watch out for the two dudes in here
[2:06:04] <yakuzaspirit> is this assisted????????
[2:06:04] <PSI_Guy95> Mr. X says "Your motherfucking life ends in 30 minutes" and waits patiently
[2:06:06] <germanmafia23> I always forget the damn gear here
[2:06:07] <KenKhaoz> what did he finish? I saw the first stream but been working
[2:06:10] <+psithen> i'm so disappointed there is no classic crank noise with the classic pack
[2:06:11] <Yummy_Nukes> bleeeeeaarrrghghgh
[2:06:11] <dukenux> geez
[2:06:15] <bigdumbidiotguy> zombies with hats are way tougher in this game still
[2:06:16] <+Xx_Estos_xX> So I hear they can’t attack you without their heads....can you confirm this pro strat? KappaHD
[2:06:21] <%Aztec50> i did not know there were zombies in this room before mr x came
[2:06:24] <%DirtyGaijin> Mr X gives you a sporting head start
[2:06:25] <%connos_livereview> soon
[2:06:27] <bigdumbidiotguy> this room in general is fucking annoying

[2:08:25] <gustavozxd> @bigdumbidiotguy it's there in leon A
[2:08:26] <Guardiansaiyan> Get Marvins dead theme song going...
[2:08:27] <%konekoryugamine> Okay, apparently there is a new bug that came up in 76 BECAUSE of this patch. PUrchasing plans sometimes has it come up as NOT available on the PIPBoy, and then when you look in your inventory you have it.
[2:08:29] <Predatorhahaha23000> WITH DARKNESS AND SILENCE through the night.
[2:08:31] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @tigerfang86 it's totally the game I've waited 13 years for tho, but it's a little overwhelming that they put in EVERYTHING from ALL THE GAMES. Flowmotion and shotlocks are nuts
[2:08:32] <%TombstoneTTromboners> yo paige mind if I take the food outta your fridge
[2:08:32] <bigdumbidiotguy> my dad fell off a 40 ft ladder and hurt his back real bad
[2:08:32] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@garbageheaphound) (warning)
[2:08:32] <%konekoryugamine> So then you have to buy it again
[2:08:32] <%Aztec50> WHO'S SIGNING
[2:08:32] <OwlLightningMage> I hope it was neon blue
[2:08:33] <%rdark_ksu> Paige you would have a blue barn
[2:08:33] <PortableBoredom> Is this Leon A or B?
[2:08:34] <Desertfishing> tie the mic to her so she cant push it away Kappa
[2:08:35] <+SweepTheLegoMyEggo> Cant be a barn unless its red
[2:08:37] <+Alig200> @bigdumbidiotguy all Leon scenarios get that room, just Claire that doesnt.
[2:08:38] <%konekoryugamine> THANKS BETHESDA
[2:08:38] <%DirtyGaijin> A
[2:08:41] <InkyDraconian> Just like Molo and Otis
[2:08:41] <dukenux> and then they scratched you
[2:08:42] <+Bagmanmanman> Ive completed Leon A and Claire B so I have no idea how to get those original sound effects
[2:08:43] <Yummy_Nukes> we're all literally sitting right in front of y'all geez

[2:09:16] <+jjjkopf> F
[2:09:16] <%connos_livereview> whyd you do him like that
[2:09:17] <%ThePuddingDead> big back down
[2:09:17] <TheHeroAppears> he didn't have a gun it seems
[2:09:17] <Desertfishing> he's a coward
[2:09:17] <FoghornLeghornII> vashCry
[2:09:17] <Vohs_Bru> COWARD
[2:09:17] <%AncelDeLambert> maybe he did?
[2:09:17] <Worldbrand> he fell asleep
[2:09:18] <%Remery_> Marvin could have been an ass-eating zmbie :(
[2:09:18] <lloyddboy> WHERE'S HIS AMMO
[2:09:18] <+Robopengy> Maybe he tried
[2:09:19] <BeefyQueefer> barns are traditionally red because people mixed in rust powder to the pain, because it helped killed bacteria and moss that would rot the wood
[2:09:19] <DeliciousPears> Who's talking!?
[2:09:20] <+WormBoss> where's his gun?
[2:09:21] <+tigerfang86> COWARD OUT
[2:09:21] <+PenmanLupine> figured he passed out before he could
[2:09:21] <A_Zealous_Retort> F
[2:09:21] <Fujiwara_92> no balls
[2:09:23] <%snow_bush> Suicide is a sin!
[2:09:24] <Blackjacket644> Do you have to kill him?
[2:09:24] <%Hazard_Kujacker> I'VE GOT A SHOTGUn
[2:09:24] <dekkitout> it probably hurts ALOT
[2:09:25] <%konekoryugamine> Yeah what he sad
[2:09:25] <dukenux> Leon took all the ammo LUL
[2:09:25] <nobody12349> No ammo
[2:09:26] <Predatorhahaha23000> he will turn faster
[2:09:26] <%ThatGuyfromMars> It's hard to kill yourself
[2:09:26] <%rdark_ksu> in many religions suicide is a big no no
[2:09:27] <%ElenaManetta> Even Lee asked a little girl to shoot him in the face like a man would.
[2:09:27] <$Chimeraelite> Facts
[2:09:27] <+HoloToast> maybe he was allergic to bullets
[2:09:27] <Overloard> don't worry marvin we'll get you to a doctor real soon Kapppa
[2:09:28] <missingangle> Maybe he didn't want to kill himself??
[2:09:29] <+The_monster_hunter> @AngriestPat they can obviously survive multiple headshots lol
[2:09:29] <%DirtyGaijin> was a fake gun
[2:09:29] <%konekoryugamine> SAD, SURE
[2:09:30] <%superxinvader> Marvin got juicy
[2:09:30] <+MeatBomb> He passed out and turned in sleep.
[2:09:31] <%TombstoneTTromboners> who's to say he didn't shoot himself, think of how much you've shot zombies in the head and they've been fine
[2:09:31] <+Thorn14> He also thought Leon was probably not going to return to the PD
[2:09:31] <%RaikenTB> Dammit, Paige FailFish
[2:09:32] <OwlLightningMage> He probably did and it didn't work. Marvin is too strong
[2:09:32] <%Remery_> Maybe he wanted to be a ass-eating zombie!!1
[2:09:32] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Because he passed out from blood loss?
[2:09:32] <TheEnablerr> He thought Leon wouldn't come back?
[2:09:35] <Grennold> Marv LuL
[2:09:35] <ScreamingMeat> In OG RE2 it's implied he was going to but then pussied out
[2:09:36] <+Talbz> Maybe he thought he could keep helping Leon
[2:09:37] <%TeraMercier> He was waiting as long as he could and he reanimated before he could tell
[2:09:37] <+Nomicro4u> Maybe you don't know whatcha messin with
[2:09:37] <Vohs_Bru> HE HAD TWO GUNS
[2:09:37] <CrabSlacks> you've seen how many bullets it takes, he turned into a zombie after the first shot
[2:09:37] <PROUD2beGINGER> So he was bluffing earlier?
[2:09:38] <bigdumbidiotguy> he doesnt kill himself in the original either
[2:09:38] <bennc60> I wonder how many pulp fiction jokes are made with marvin
[2:09:40] <SpydaMan_SLiM> Because according to RE2make Headshots don't mean nothing lmao
[2:09:40] <CptBritches> Pat you would not have the nuts to shoot yourself
[2:09:40] <%bbomi1995> he was probably trying to help leon as long as possible and passed out
[2:09:41] <+Templar15> You probably lose awareness on they way out, so you forget to shoot
[2:09:41] <%Jjrossman> Maybe he's catholic
[2:09:42] <+Spikyshrike> LUL
[2:09:43] <dukenux> dammit Leon
[2:09:43] <%konekoryugamine> That Joker laugh shit
[2:09:44] <Beef_Broganoff> He probably knew Leon was a super-rookie cop and could take care of it
[2:09:44] <Yummy_Nukes> no gun means no bullet!
[2:09:45] <ohgodnotthebeees> LUL

[2:10:03] <%snow_bush> @AngriestPat The truest way is to get a grenade, walk into zombies, and pull the pin
[2:10:03] <%willjar313> Maybe one of Marvin's zombie plans involved knowingly infecting himself so he could eat someone he didn't like?
[2:10:03] <Gruhunchously> Hahahah I'm gonna die

[2:10:58] <+Spikyshrike> @Jjrossman There is an interpretation of the CCC that says suicidal ideation itself implies you are not of right mind. And you cannot commit a mortal sin if you're not of right mind, so suicide may be interpreted as never damning to hell.
[2:11:03] <%Toynota10> @AngriestPat He probably tried to take out as many as he could before his inevitable death
[2:11:04] <+Talbz> @AngriestPat I wish when you kill Marvin, you see his soul fly up to heaven like Joseph and he gives Leon/Claire a thumbs up

[2:13:54] <%ElenaManetta> Hearing Pat spastically do the inventory with those old sounds makes him almost sound like a pro speedrunner
[2:13:54] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 13m.
[2:13:55] <%rdark_ksu> Paige what is your favorite think you have had in Montreal that isnt Mcdonalds?
[2:13:56] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Pat's muscle memory is kicking in with the old sounds
[2:13:57] <$Dotta5> MAG Ammo, or MAGA for short
[2:14:05] <+Talbz> @AngriestPat Which is cannon, Leon A or Claire A?
[2:14:13] <%DirtyGaijin> Paige hasn't got her skin on
[2:14:13] <$megamonmon123> what?
[2:14:14] <+HoloToast> I feel like Leon A is "big gunpowder into shotgun" and the rest is combining the same variants
[2:14:15] <%Archphronimos> I suggest we start a protest !raffle until we get BABY
[2:14:15] <DotDusk> Hi Elliot

[2:14:19] <$megamonmon123> leon b is way harder
[2:14:20] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @Talbz I believe Claire A is canon
[2:14:20] <germanmafia23> never stop eating ass
[2:14:21] <PROUD2beGINGER> Enjoying your meal sir?
[2:14:21] <bigdumbidiotguy> claire has the 2 lickers in the basement and that's it, really.
[2:14:22] <+Slice_of_Kris> lickers are super hard for leon compaired to clair but that is because clair has all the guns!
[2:14:28] <%GohanEgret> I wish there was an animation of nailing the boards to the windows
[2:14:28] <%connos_livereview> it seems like niether are in this game
[2:14:38] <PSI_Guy95> Mr. X was only in B routes originally right?
[2:14:40] <Gruhunchously> Not one can parse what actually happened that night
[2:14:42] <reddeadwine1277> RE2 runs on Dark Souls time
[2:14:42] <%DirtyGaijin> Claires Grenade launcher is pretty strong
[2:14:43] <+zetaplus> Claire a is canon
[2:14:43] <OwlLightningMage> It's canon like Dark Souls canon
[2:14:43] <+Templar15> plot twist there were TWO ANNETTES
[2:14:44] <%RaikenTB> the story in this version is told worse for the most part.
[2:14:46] <DarkKnightGrave> Make Magnum Great Again
[2:14:46] <%ThatGuyfromMars> yes @PSI_Guy95
[2:14:46] <%snow_bush> The novelization is canon

[2:15:03] <benjiFG> time is convoluted in montreal
[2:15:04] <ScreamingMeat> Y'know the upgraded Shotgun and Magnum taking up more inventory space makes no sense. Because extended barrel/stock or no the Shotgun still sets on your back the same way

[2:43:29] <%TeraMercier> @bigdumbidiotguy I thought that since he doesn't show up after getting disemboweled by G that it's only one and he does some dumb teleporting video game shit
[2:43:30] <zeepyrus> Zoom on da ass
[2:43:32] <+Alig200> @valkuma I believe the lore reason for that is Kendo gave away all his weaponry so that people could try and survive.

[2:46:11] <+SPKTR34> @AngriestPat it appears younger people have a higher chance to tolerate a virus, like sherry with G and this girl with T
[2:46:11] <$SGrim> DOUBLE KILL rooH
[2:46:13] <AmericanaRed> cmonBruh
[2:46:14] <%willjar313> That kid held it together better than most of the adults that got infected.

[2:46:18] <+LethalPlacebo> Wasn't Kendo supposed to be Japanese-American?
[2:46:19] <%lewdskeletor13> Oh wait is Martinez in the DLC?
[2:46:19] <bananrrr> leon da hero
[2:46:20] <ClarkWasHere> i want to see raccoon city blow up on current gen graphics
[2:46:20] <%JerithGeros> Crazy how they turned Keno from a joke into such a solid moment of grief
[2:46:22] <+Nomicro4u> So shiney
[2:46:22] <Cthulos> What if Kendo survives and becomes the gun dealer in 4?
[2:46:22] <MyNameIsRasus> The DLC is why there's no second shot
[2:46:23] <%connos_livereview> DOUBLEKILL

[2:46:27] <+Sxy_T_Rex> He dropped his gun
[2:46:27] <%TeraMercier> @Beef_Broganoff I didn't think of that, that would have been an incredible touch like halfway through this conversation
[2:46:28] <circular7> lies
[2:46:29] <%AirlineFood74> @circular7 Her
[2:46:29] <%sobek399> kendo has to get eaten by zombies

[2:46:34] <%Corporate_Redeemer> Sorry about that, darlin.
[2:46:34] <Cthulos> They have similar builds
[2:46:35] <+HoloToast> lucky for Kendo, his daughter was just enough XP to level up so he'll be fine
[2:46:35] <+grumbleroar> Leon is so bishie in this game, it's nuts.
[2:46:35] <Junkfist> He shot their dog who we'll play in Ghost Survivors
[2:46:37] <bigdumbidiotguy> @alig200 that's what the original RE3 says, but this time around that may not be the casw
[2:46:37] <AlasterAngelo> "Nah we're gonna make out all right"
[2:46:38] <MyNameIsRasus> WHO'S SHOOTING?
[2:46:39] <%AncelDeLambert> that or they get infected differently
[2:46:43] <TheEnablerr> WHAT CITY Leon
[2:46:43] <%bearalin> Well she isn’t lying
[2:46:44] <%Totally_not_toby> like the measles
[2:46:47] <tank7013> The DLC is all what if scenarios though, so Kendo not killing himself here means nothing
[2:46:47] <+runegod20> sherry doesn't get infected until like, way later and don't we cure her not long after?
[2:46:48] <germanmafia23> The kid obviously shot Kendo
[2:46:49] <Guardiansaiyan> SAVE THE CITY
[2:46:51] <%lewdskeletor13> WHAT CITY
[2:46:51] <+Slice_of_Kris> like the kid who comes back and killes tommy
[2:46:52] <dekkitout> kids are walking petri dishes so that doesnt surprise me
[2:46:53] <%connos_livereview> im resistant to earl gray hot
[2:46:53] <%harrydeans_hawaiian_shirt> LEON IS NOT A BADASS, BUT A KING OF CRINGE, pat
[2:46:54] <Beef_Broganoff> Yeah @TeraMercier I was bracing for it during their conversation
[2:46:54] <+Punchasaur> Rob shot first
[2:46:56] <%ThatGuyfromMars> I hope there's Ada DLC that covers her fucking surviving the facility because I still dunno how she did it
[2:46:56] <%mostundesired> SECRETY
[2:46:56] <%RaikenTB> You actually see Ada emote in these scenes now.
[2:46:57] <Desertfishing> like pat being D resistant
[2:46:58] <%DirtyGaijin> Test it on the kids so the adults dont stand a chance
[2:46:58] <CastellanVon> Leon and Claire are modeled after actual models in this game. They're so bishie
[2:46:58] <%DetroitSentai> Sherry wasn't tolerance, shes justa genetic match from Birken
[2:47:02] <reddeadwine1277> hurr udrr
[2:47:03] <%ElenaManetta> Umbrella is a dumb name
[2:47:04] <dan_g_v> also that girl from Darkside Chronicles, she was on the younger side
[2:47:04] <mastermidget23> That line.
[2:47:05] <TheEnablerr> Leon, everyone's fuckin' dead.
[2:47:05] <bigdumbidiotguy> I wonder if the kids in the orphanage are Wesker kids.
[2:47:06] <Guardiansaiyan> The CITY can be SAVED
[2:47:07] <%TeraMercier> @germanmafia23 That would be a great twist for the DLC, play as the infected kid
[2:47:07] <%whydoprintersbreak> what about D RESISTANT!?!?!
[2:47:08] <+Yokuho> @AngriestPat After the croc theres a racoon, you can't go back if you missi t

[2:47:09] <%DirtyGaijin> thats such a strange delivery
[2:47:09] <AlasterAngelo> "Indestructible"
[2:47:09] <%stoicman90> dont forget that one monster from RE1
[2:47:10] <fruit_pie_the_magician> %10 of the population is t resistant
[2:47:10] <+DestroyerPhoenix> said leon, cheerfully
[2:47:12] <Lesionnaire> what a dork
[2:47:13] <+HoloToast> it's raining on the city because UMBRELLA is fucked
[2:47:16] <gustavozxd> leon does actually "save" the city in one of those game clear images in re2
[2:47:17] <garbageheaphound> the things you've seen that will never go away
[2:47:19] <%Ahack13> He says that line so cheerfully

[2:47:35] <+LinkmanBG> leon's playthrough is campy like the original
[2:47:35] <%ThatGuyfromMars> Yo the alligator is the fucking best
[2:47:36] <%willjar313> The only person in this game that fought off the virus better than that girl was Marvin.
[2:47:37] <%Corporate_Redeemer> SAVE THE CITY *city gets nuked*
[2:47:38] <FoghornLeghornII> just sex her already

[2:49:10] <AmericanaRed> I can’t wait for memes to become something old people do
[2:49:10] <MyNameIsRasus> the best part about this part of the game is seeing everyone on strem getting banned from trying to type the meme in all caps

[2:50:19] <+Alig200> I mean, all the original did was make you manually run back to the gas canister and then shoot it, this just streamlines it.
[2:50:20] <%Cobalt_Racer> PEE PEE WATER
[2:50:21] <%Kahnicus> @mostundesired I'm assuming people who live in towns with puzzle museums converted into police stations probably mostly funded by some eccentric corporate overlord were still using typewriters in 98.
[2:50:22] <dan_g_v> that will demoralize him!
[2:50:23] <%TeraMercier> @ElenaManetta There was a vague concept in the original that it made animals bigger, which was vaguely elaborated on in 0. There were giant spiders in the original

[2:51:10] <bigdumbidiotguy> @angriestpat don't forget my tip for the sewer. get close enough to the G embryo to shoot them and then run by them. it will save a lot of ammo
[2:51:10] <+Yokuho> Did he miss the racoon?
[2:51:11] <+Blackgaver> all that doodoo water... surpised leon didin't get the syphalus
[2:51:14] <BeefyQueefer> that means someone in Raccoon City flushed a handgrenade down the fucking toilet at some point

[2:51:21] <OwlLightningMage> They sell them to aliens
[2:51:21] <+Alig200> have you gotten through Ada's segment using only the EMF visualizer? @AngriestPat
[2:51:22] <AlasterAngelo> We have no idea what Umbrella does Leon
[2:51:26] <+Slice_of_Kris> does route a or b change the lab sequence at all?
[2:51:27] <%ThatGuyfromMars> why the fuck would they sell the viruses
[2:51:27] <+DestroyerPhoenix> military loves the big monster bois
[2:51:28] <%connos_livereview> annette is an uggo

[2:51:29] <+mugwugsampoo> cmonBruh
[2:51:30] <AlasterAngelo> No selling the virus is stupid
[2:51:32] <Trashboat_W> The gator has nothing to do with the T-virus. Somebody just flushed it years ago.

[2:51:44] <AlasterAngelo> sell Tyrants not the means to make Tyrants

[2:51:46] <ChiefSombrero> OOPS ALL VIRUS
[2:51:47] <Beef_Broganoff> I like the idea of Umbrella shipping a box full of G Virus meat to somebody's doorstep

[2:58:04] <IFlaske> disney magic :)
[2:58:04] <bigdumbidiotguy> the unlockables in this game require some serious ability
[2:58:05] <+CBROGERS2013> He's gotta pure heart, he'll walk it off
[2:58:06] <dan_g_v> and the bandages are OVER the clothes
[2:58:06] <Worldbrand> he's got thick pecs
[2:58:06] <%Typhaeon> The heart is in the center of the chest
[2:58:08] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> He has the thing where the organs are on the opposite side
[2:58:08] <Beef_Broganoff> @DSD24 That I did notice, I think she voiced a system voice in Rev 1 too
[2:58:08] <Gruhunchously> Nah, that's above the heart
[2:58:08] <%GohanEgret> it is
[2:58:08] <reonome> oh wow thats a nice detail

[2:58:12] <%JerithGeros> I prefer the gangster outfit from RE2 where he takes no damage... his skin just deflects it
[2:58:12] <vedammi> RE pat is BEST Pat
[2:58:13] <%Arsimckhoi> Leon's heart is on his sleeve soooo... the bullet missed his chest
[2:58:13] <%ElenaManetta> The heart is in the shoulder
[2:58:14] <%Jjrossman> Heart is in the middle
[2:58:15] <reddeadwine1277> Lung at risk, not heart
[2:58:16] <%Typhaeon> That would be his lung
[2:58:17] <%Big_Dream> yea the hart is lower
[2:58:18] <1stpigeon2scuba> I took seven grenades to the heart
[2:58:18] <+Dr_DangerPhD> Leon too stronk for a bullet to the heart to kill him
[2:58:18] <PROUD2beGINGER> eh, lung but no heart
[2:58:19] <%FracturedImage> Is pat a heartless?

[2:58:49] <Dieworc> That wound is gonna get super infected
[2:58:49] <pimpinahz> the heart is in the middle of your chest, slightly leaning to the right. behind the sternum
[2:58:49] <thebakaliyen> no bulli

[2:58:53] <+Slice_of_Kris> go go electic zap gun oh wait
[2:58:53] <Gruhunchously> Leon thinks he's such a badass
[2:58:53] <TheIncoherentGamer> thats a lung 100% though
[2:58:53] <stoneyjenson> That is in thr top of the lung. he would be doing not so great right now.
[2:58:54] <%ElenaManetta> Is Elmo is a good pest and mouse hunter or is he too grandpa to chase mice
[2:58:55] <Desertfishing> the heart is a wee bit lower like more towards the center under nipple level
[2:58:56] <leinadtonu> Pat doesn't know what a heart is
[2:58:57] <oponomo2> Chris can teach a few things to Leon
[2:58:59] <Beef_Broganoff> Leon is resistant to T. And bullets.
[2:59:00] <%Aztec50> i would think getting shot in the torso region would be pretty fatal anyways
[2:59:00] <%GohanEgret> @GeneralSCPatton [SHIT TALK]
[2:59:01] <%ThatGuyfromMars> I like how they progressively look more like shit as you play the game
[2:59:02] <Ariksgabs> Elmo can handle Jiren

[2:59:24] <dan_g_v> Elmo can't hunt rodents
[2:59:28] <%ThatGuyfromMars> was arkham the first game that did that? as you played on the character got more haggard and beaten?
[2:59:31] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Everyone always acts like getting stabbed in your shoulder is okay, but your big heart tubes go up there
[2:59:34] <%connos_livereview> OLD
[2:59:35] <%willjar313> Heart is slightly to the left. Even still, bullet to the lung is potentially lethal. He could very well lose that lung.
[2:59:36] <DarkKnightGrave> G GON GIVE IT TO YA
[2:59:38] <KenKhaoz> He'll be fine.
[2:59:39] <AntChodeny> Elmo for the 4th ghost survivor

[3:05:18] <bigdumbidiotguy> @angriestpat I wouldn't lead you astray. I've beaten the game on hardcore
[3:05:18] <+runegod20> i feel like crawling zombies are ones you should be allowed to counter the most
[3:05:20] <Tevvy> yeah knifing from the front is mad danger, you dont stunlock them. gotta knife downed guys from behind
[3:05:20] <ScreamingMeat> He did even do a grab animation
[3:05:21] <%FrostMass22> Raise your framerate to make the knife more gooder
[3:05:27] <ScreamingMeat> *didn't
[3:05:28] <Desertfishing> if only the knife was like the one in CVX
[3:05:36] <leinadtonu> yeyeye go zombie
[3:05:40] <+Blackgaver> bitch knife
[3:05:42] <+valkuma> if only you could just curbstomp their head
[3:05:49] <%sobek399> super knife
[3:05:49] <dukenux> Yeah you gotta backstab zombies like a real hero
[3:05:50] <$Princepurple8> Why does he kill them instead of saving time by just running past them?

[3:05:56] <Beef_Broganoff> god lmao blasting the "sleeping" zombies is so funny
[3:05:57] <Gruhunchously> @FrostMass22 The idea of knife damage being tied to framerate is still blowing my mind.
[3:05:58] <Ion_LaserX> Gotta wait for RE8 for that
[3:06:00] <+CBROGERS2013> This game could Really use a Dead Space stomp
[3:06:01] <Acidshocker> Did he get the tape?
[3:06:03] <%DirtyGaijin> code veronica remake?
[3:06:06] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @Princepurple8 he has to come back to that area
[3:06:07] <Desertfishing> worst water slide ever
[3:06:09] <%GeneralSCPatton> What is CVX?
[3:06:10] <thelonechris> The big stupid bandage is a nice touch
[3:06:14] <valachi> @CBROGERS2013 Every game could use a Dead Space stomp tbh
[3:06:15] <LustrousEudemon> bring back RE5 stomp into RE2
[3:06:17] <Desertfishing> code veronica X
[3:06:20] <reddeadwine1277> Use your power fist
[3:06:20] <%TeraMercier> @Gruhunchously Same principle as Dark Souls 2 durability being tied to framerate
[3:06:21] <Tracazoid> So in a potential CVX remake do you think they'll make the knife as OP
[3:06:22] <%Mikatonic> if only the knife was like MW2 commando pro perk

[3:08:40] <garbageheaphound> 2nd run puzzle it seems

[3:09:01] <Cthulos> To update the name of the item
[3:09:02] <gustavozxd> @valachi what i mean is re6 Ada belongs in the trash

[3:10:33] <%TeraMercier> @Princepurple8 RE4 HD is pretty much that. Too much of RE4's design is based in it's movement and shooting system. An overhaul would be like making a different game, not even in the same spirit
[3:10:35] <gustavozxd> nothing needs to change in re4, maybe remove tank controls but that's it
[3:10:37] <%FrostMass22> @princepurple8 Maybe change the tone from an action game to more like traditional survival horror, maybe

[3:11:14] <Shwepie> @Princepurple8 I don't think anything in RE4 needs to be remade/reimagined. Maybe a remaster down the line that just changes all the graphics but nothing else would be interesting.
[3:11:23] <dking0000> There is nothing even remotely necessary to change
[3:11:23] <Fujiwara_92> just use the shottie pat
[3:11:24] <%TeraMercier> @valachi TBH I've noticed that some companies like Konami and Capcom will fuck around with how racially pronounced their characters are

[3:11:27] <%DirtyGaijin> A remaster would be fine for 4
[3:11:27] <%Bredirish123> @ThatGuyfromMars It's almost disconcerting how close it's remained to the original. You always worry about remakes taking too many liberties. This is a perfect balance
[3:11:30] <Beef_Broganoff> What the hell was that crunchy noise
[3:11:35] <%sobek399> remake RE6
[3:11:35] <Gruhunchously> There seem to be a large number of asian zombies for an American mid-size town.
[3:11:38] <OwlLightningMage> They should make RE4 more like the better game 6 Kappa
[3:11:40] <%JJCheeker> When Pat gets old he's gonna be like Abe Simpson
[3:11:44] <+HoloToast> forgot the key
[3:11:46] <%TeraMercier> @DirtyGaijin We got that a couple years ago on Ps4 and PC
[3:11:49] <person181> use GUN
[3:11:53] <Coystick> !uptime
[3:11:54] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 11m.
[3:11:56] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @Bredirish123 it's weird how much love Capcom puts into their RE remakes. if only they could do that with their core series
[3:11:56] <leinadtonu> I'd like RE 4 with this controls
[3:11:57] <lionandfox21> I want a remake for Code Veronica and 3
[3:11:59] <Beef_Broganoff> splorch
[3:12:00] <OwlLightningMage> Every RE game should be 6 Kappa
[3:12:05] <gustavozxd> re6 is fine as it is, either retcon it or just don't ever touch it
[3:12:05] <dekkitout> "I used to be with it, then they remastered it"
[3:12:06] <IminyourBase> shotgun shells are like mega-potions, you save them forever til you need them.
[3:12:07] <%GohanEgret> s q u e a k
[3:12:07] <dking0000> Make Leon the only part in RE6 and it automatically becomes better
[3:12:10] <+Blackgaver> skeaky skeaky
[3:12:15] <TheEnablerr> [ S Q U E A K ]
[3:12:15] <%lewdskeletor13> A Code Veronica REmake would be lit
[3:12:16] <%DirtyGaijin> @OwlLightningMage why do you try to hurt us
[3:12:23] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Feels so good gurl
[3:12:26] <%TeraMercier> RE123 "suffer" from their tank controls and non 3d environments, RE 4 does not.
[3:12:28] <%connos_livereview> ah yes chat does the very funny and original resident evil 6 is good joke
[3:12:32] <%sobek399> remake re6 but betterer
[3:12:34] <gustavozxd> leon's section is awful in re6 though LUL cheap jumpscares and forced walking
[3:12:34] <reddeadwine1277> Damn it feels good to be a gansta...
[3:12:36] <%s_xylocalsingles> Woolie just read Paiges dono
[3:12:47] <valachi> @lewdskeletor13 I wonder if they would have to change the crossdressing dude around so Capcom doesn't catch any flak
[3:12:47] <Beef_Broganoff> I had fun with 6 but it was a fundamentally different kind of fun than like any other game in the series
[3:12:51] <Gruhunchously> RE 6 is the best game in the series hands down.
[3:12:57] <%TeraMercier> Who the fuck even wants the awful story from RE6, even if you made it play better
[3:13:01] <FstSergeant8595> RE4 will hold up until 2030 or later. No need to remake that game for a long ass time
[3:13:06] <%JJCheeker> Code Veronica is awful so they could definitely fix it
[3:13:09] <dking0000> I remember Leon’s section compared to Chris and Weskers Balls
[3:13:15] <mayorrev> paige just fuckin roasted you on woolies stream
[3:13:15] <%JJCheeker> If they remake it
[3:13:17] <%sobek399> they'd have to do a whole new story
[3:13:17] <valachi> I'm gonna say this now, If Jake from RE6 played like a DMC character I'd call that part of RE6 a 10/10
[3:13:20] <%GeneralSCPatton> @gruhunchously Hammer the buttons and wiggle the sticks!
[3:13:21] <allanmiri> pop
[3:13:31] <+runegod20> remaking the games that were either really old or really jank should be the next step
[3:13:33] <%connos_livereview> code veronica is beyond saving
[3:13:33] <mayorrev> she called you a smelly and a poopy
[3:13:34] <OwlLightningMage> Jake should straight up just be a DMC character instead
[3:13:35] <Gruhunchously> @GeneralSCPatton Love hammering the buttons
[3:13:35] <reddeadwine1277> itum
[3:13:36] <%Kahnicus> BE KNIFED FAT EVIL
[3:13:39] <%sobek399> yes
[3:13:39] <%Bredirish123> RE4 remake wouldn't be bad if they held it to this standard
[3:13:40] <%TeraMercier> Would Code Veronica's story fit a 'realistic' tone?
[3:13:41] <gustavozxd> Chris was a fun action game, leon was a comical re2 and jake was just bad
[3:13:44] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> blow dudes
[3:13:57] <valachi> Also RE6 Sherry and RE4 Ada > Almost every other RE girl. Change my mind.
[3:13:58] <AlasterAngelo> Leon is slightly better at blowing dudes than Claire
[3:13:58] <%valriot> wrong
[3:14:00] <%RaikenTB> Claire has a magnum.
[3:14:01] <AlasterAngelo> but only slightly
[3:14:03] <Gruhunchously> Bazooka doesn't pop heads?
[3:14:03] <%sobek399> For real though, remake 3
[3:14:04] <The_Blumper> LUL
[3:14:07] <garbageheaphound> big whiff
[3:14:07] <%DirtyGaijin> Id be happy for them to make new stories set between this and 5 using this style
[3:14:10] <%TeraMercier> A flame grenade is just as good
[3:14:10] <+runegod20> so is the long barrel for the grenade launcher worth it?
[3:14:13] <%sobek399> complete the trilogy
[3:14:14] <gustavozxd> Jake is pretty damn lame
[3:14:17] <%Kahnicus> Aaaaannnnndd Leon steps on a used needle.
[3:14:18] <%ThatGuyfromMars> what is chat's opinion on the redfield redesign in 7
[3:14:21] <+Templar15> Claire has a better time with Lickers, Leon is better with normal zombies and plants
[3:14:24] <%sobek399> dislike
[3:14:30] <valachi> @ThatGuyfromMars It's shit.
[3:14:31] <%connos_livereview> leon is the best re girl
[3:14:31] <%TeraMercier> I'd say 2.5 with Chris' adventures in Europe could be fun!
[3:14:35] <%DirtyGaijin> Not a problem for me @ThatGuyfromMars
[3:14:36] <dking0000> Jake as Wesker’s son is less interesting then Sheva
[3:14:39] <ShichiNoBushi> "It can't be aimed adequately," he says as he misses a zombie.
[3:14:41] <Tevvy> not even then
[3:14:42] <%Bredirish123> @ThatGuyfromMars Not bad tbh
[3:14:43] <OwlLightningMage> I don't like 7 Christ but I like this new Claire
[3:14:44] <reddeadwine1277> @ThatGuyfromMars Not on board with it
[3:14:44] <%valriot> Claires magnum is that, cos her smg, flarerounds and sparkshot are BUSTED
[3:14:45] <gustavozxd> @thatguyfrommars they redesigned his ass 30 times
[3:14:48] <%GeneralSCPatton> Am I the only one who doesn't use that 3 round burst part? Total waste of ammo.
[3:14:48] <+Yokuho> My problems
[3:14:48] <person181> things i don't like
[3:14:49] <vextalyst> @AngriestPat Claire's hp rounds pop heads reliably
[3:14:49] <Tevvy> you dont need the g launcher at all for the birkins
[3:14:52] <OwlLightningMage> Christ LUL
[3:14:54] <gustavozxd> just another one to the list
[3:14:55] <Fujiwara_92> a plant monster
[3:14:56] <Gruhunchously> Pat may not be a reliable source
[3:14:58] <Tevvy> let alone the gl stock
[3:14:58] <nobody12349> My hopes and dreams
[3:15:00] <lloyddboy> but A E S T H E T I C tho
[3:15:03] <%GohanEgret> Sheva is best RE waifu, @ me only if you agree
[3:15:05] <%JerithGeros> Sometimes you just gotta let a peacock fly, man
[3:15:13] <vampireinarm> WTF does an avarage workday look like in this looney puzzle land of a city
[3:15:15] <dking0000> Sheva deserves more
[3:15:15] <+G_Thunders> Does anyone actually want to see Ethan and Mia in RE8?
[3:15:16] <%connos_livereview> moira is actually the best girl
[3:15:17] <$MajorCrasher> 7 Chris was cool and makes more sense than re5 chris
[3:15:18] <%DirtyGaijin> he looks like a mess
[3:15:19] <%ThatGuyfromMars> wow I got 4 varying opinions, sick.
[3:15:19] <lionandfox21> HIS KNEES
[3:15:23] <AlasterAngelo> I PUT SO MUCH IN YOU
[3:15:24] <Angry_Ev1L> 7 chris is literally wtf who is this guy tier
[3:15:26] <%TeraMercier> @GeneralSCPatton It only fires as many rounds as you hold the trigger for. You can reliably only fire a single shot
[3:15:28] <OwlLightningMage> That wasn't his true form LUL
[3:15:29] <+Yokuho> Hahaah 1 shot
[3:15:32] <%sobek399> lol "puzzle land of a city"
[3:15:35] <gustavozxd> knife is not good for that Pat FailFish
[3:15:36] <gunzerkingdunce> @angriestpat so there IS a Basketball Rebecca EE
[3:15:38] <Beef_Broganoff> Y'all are sleepin on Lady Hunk
[3:15:39] <reddeadwine1277> @ThatGuyfromMars Chris is in his late 30's early 40's by now? How are you gonna sell me that he cut all that mass, and looks younger/less haggard?
[3:15:41] <dking0000> If we get RE8 Sheva should be part of blue Umbrella in some way
[3:15:45] <Angry_Ev1L> I played in VR and when he was like I'm redfield I was like ???
[3:15:46] <+zetaplus> Sheva is great waifu
[3:15:49] <JittersCaffeine> Pat the Ripper
[3:15:49] <Desertfishing> you were 1 short like in the height
[3:15:49] <person181> why does watching this game make me sleepy
[3:15:51] <Gruhunchously> The less dignified parts of zombie killing
[3:15:53] <%connos_livereview> lady hunk is kinda lame tbh
[3:15:54] <$Big_King_Coconut> that was just a hobo, not a zombie
[3:15:55] <%DirtyGaijin> I wasnt a fan of Chris the brickhouse
[3:15:55] <%TeraMercier> @vampireinarm It all falls apart once you imagine regular people trying to accomplish anything normal at work
[3:15:57] <Fujiwara_92> SHEENA FOR RE8
[3:15:58] <%mostundesired> The RE zombies do kind of break apart super easily.
[3:15:59] <%valriot> Thats the point Pat, she can just murder every enemy here in one shot, cos the rounds arent worth using on the bosses
[3:15:59] <reonome> I love seeing pat so happy about videogames
[3:16:03] <+Blackgaver> he luves it
[3:16:03] <%GeneralSCPatton> @teramercier Neat
[3:16:04] <Fujiwara_92> *SHEEVA
[3:16:05] <AlasterAngelo> Side characters never come back Sheva is gone forever
[3:16:06] <VERDAXY> you need to burn the zombies
[3:16:07] <%Niney_Who> All asses inferior to the Leon Badonkadonk must perish
[3:16:08] <+HoloToast> Leon liked to cut his meat before eating
[3:16:09] <curse85> my problem with chris in 7 is hes rather generic looking
[3:16:09] <Beef_Broganoff> @connos_livereview trust me you are right
[3:16:11] <%connos_livereview> missed opportunity to make her swole
[3:16:11] <Acidshocker> Please stay dead, please just stay dead! vanaCrossem vanaCrossem
[3:16:16] <%sobek399> heat the zombies
[3:16:19] <circular7> makes leon feel like a big man
[3:16:21] <Beef_Broganoff> Double right in fact
[3:16:23] <FstSergeant8595> I want to see what a 2019 RE0 Rebecca would look like
[3:16:23] <%AceofThePack> Because no one is allowed to be thicker than Leon
[3:16:24] <%JerithGeros> That zombie butt was coming right for me!
[3:16:24] <Fujiwara_92> SHEEVA AND LEON IN RE8
[3:16:25] <%sobek399> then, freeze the zombies
[3:16:25] <+Sutokingu> RE8: Sheeva and Rebecca's power hour
[3:16:26] <lionandfox21> Well I think the furthest in the timeline the games have gotten to so far is maybe 16 to 17 years post Raccoon city according to RE7?
[3:16:26] <vextalyst> @AngriestPat clair has so many problem solvers i find it worth it to magnum strategic zombies
[3:16:28] <OwlLightningMage> @curse85 I agree with this
[3:16:30] <+Sxy_T_Rex> Barry disguised as Ada
[3:16:36] <%DirtyGaijin> They are never bringing Sheeva back
[3:16:39] <mastermidget23> Man, it would blow my mind if RE8 gets announced and Sheva is just the MC.
[3:16:41] <%mostundesired> Hey, what was X doing in the sewers, anyway?
[3:16:43] <dukenux> :(
[3:16:45] <%ThatGuyfromMars> I would love for Capcom to actually age up these characters because they still look good even though most of these characters are in their late 30s-early 40s in the later RE games
[3:16:46] <%Bredirish123> Pat don't forget to stretch my dude and drink some water.
[3:16:47] <%heliosvaporizer> apatDab apatDab
[3:16:48] <ObsidianDragon86> RIP Sheeva
[3:16:49] <+critfumble_> mr x is just zombie mister shakedown send tweet
[3:16:50] <+runegod20> can you consider sheva a side character if she was with you the entire game and is the coop character
[3:16:51] <%lewdskeletor13> Sheva BibleThump
[3:16:54] <%TeraMercier> @GeneralSCPatton I would normally agree, but I got my ass out of corners using rapid fire on it in ways that semi auto couldn't
[3:16:56] <gustavozxd> Chris never looked very unique in any re though LUL his green jacket was the only thing
[3:16:57] <%sobek399> stomping through shit
[3:16:58] <Beef_Broganoff> What about an RE Gaiden remake
[3:17:00] <dukenux> SHEVA, HURRY
[3:17:03] <%BrazenMask> Looking for his hat
[3:17:03] <%Laecerelius> Sheeva and THE LEGEND Josh Stone for RE8!
[3:17:03] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Maybe they could bring Sheva back and give her a personality
[3:17:04] <Desertfishing> he was getting his fuck on
[3:17:06] <valachi> Reminder that it isn't racist to have Sheva dress up in her Tribal costume if you're in a loving relationship with her and only have her do it if she's comfortable with the thought.
[3:17:07] <%JJCheeker> What about AAADAAA dood3S
[3:17:07] <%Kahnicus> Swimmin' in poo poo water.
[3:17:08] <%FracturedImage> itdapupu
[3:17:08] <AlasterAngelo> @runegod20 yes
[3:17:10] <%ElenaManetta> Getting lost was cute. Big strong man getting lost. Then Pat ruined it with eating poopoo water.
[3:17:12] <Gruhunchously> "K'thanks"
[3:17:14] <LiquidMathew> He was there because the Mr.X Everywhere system
[3:17:19] <+FImLazy> !uptime
[3:17:19] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 17m.
[3:17:19] <%DirtyGaijin> why do those zombies Reee
[3:17:21] <OwlLightningMage> They need to just age the story up decades and give us the children of these characters LUL
[3:17:23] <korpocalypse> @AngriestPat any changes in the remake you've noticed?
[3:17:24] <leinadtonu> It's like an artisan o isacc clarking the enemy
[3:17:25] <Beef_Broganoff> popop
[3:17:26] <AntChodeny> Mr. X eat da pupu
[3:17:27] <%superxinvader> have you given any thought to doing a No HUD run?
[3:17:27] <%connos_livereview> i like rebbeca cos i have short hair disease but shes not a particularly good character
[3:17:28] <%Bredirish123> Nice!
[3:17:29] <%TeraMercier> I always felt like it was kind of plausible that Chris just got super buff and idealistic for RE5
[3:17:29] <Gruhunchously> What the...!?
[3:17:30] <%sobek399> noice
[3:17:35] <%Laecerelius> OH NO
[3:17:38] <%mostundesired> Nice crits
[3:17:39] <OToole42> heyo pat and chat
[3:17:44] <dukenux> member Ethan Kappa
[3:17:45] <OToole42> how goes RE2?
[3:17:45] <VERDAXY> aim for the eyes
[3:17:47] <FstSergeant8595> @connos_livereview Shes hot and thats all that matters for Rebecca
[3:17:47] <%DirtyGaijin> @connos_livereview ah woolie syndrome
[3:17:47] <%ElenaManetta> Claire and Leon don't really need to say anything. I don't like hearing the WHAT THE or WHY WON'T YOU DIE or THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU lines
[3:17:50] <vampireinarm> Leon is gonna need so many anti-biotics are this is over
[3:17:52] <Gruhunchously> Pat, chat with cat.
[3:17:56] <AlasterAngelo> They either need to introduce new main characters or slide the timeline back because these characters are in their late 30s now
[3:17:56] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @TeraMercier Same, up until boulder punching
[3:17:57] <lilmac64> So what's the verdict? Is this a good or bad sewer level?
[3:17:59] <IminyourBase> do the guns have stats?
[3:18:03] <valachi> Ethan is a garbage character. Just give me Joe instead.
[3:18:06] <OwlLightningMage> Move over Ethan. Joe Baker is fucking here
[3:18:10] <+Templar15> yeah, I wish the random voice lines would change as you go forward
[3:18:10] <FstSergeant8595> @lilmac64 I hated this section of the game
[3:18:12] <dukenux> Yeyeye
[3:18:14] <valachi> @OwlLightningMage YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH
[3:18:15] <+runegod20> but what about billy
[3:18:15] <reddeadwine1277> Leon is gonna need ALL the drugs to cope after this
[3:18:16] <$Princepurple8> So is the eye critical hit real? Or is it a percent chance for the head pop?
[3:18:17] <%lewdskeletor13> Joe Baker is the best
[3:18:19] <+HoloToast> it even smells like a sewer
[3:18:20] <%ElenaManetta> Better than the Mario sewer levels?
[3:18:21] <DSD24> It looks like shit
[3:18:21] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @vampireinarm he's just gonna have an iv in his arm for the next few months
[3:18:21] <DarkKnightGrave> JOE BAKER
[3:18:22] <dking0000> Leon’s delivery on “son of a bitch” is garbage imo
[3:18:24] <OwlLightningMage> Joe Baker needs to be 8 somewhere
[3:18:26] <%TeraMercier> @ElenaManetta It's about characterization and the idea that these are regular people responding to this situation. More like a zombie movie
[3:18:28] <%mostundesired> Goo hallway WutFace
[3:18:28] <+lazerbear77> goo hallway?

[3:18:40] <%lewdskeletor13> Night Snow
[3:18:41] <%mostundesired> What's more horrifying is I know what you mean by goo hallway.
[3:18:41] <dukenux> Joe Baker is like Mr. X
[3:18:42] <cant_pick_a_name> I hate it in a good way

[3:18:47] <$MajorCrasher> bring back Joe Baker
[3:18:49] <JittersCaffeine> Apparently the most recent F76 patch undid a bunch of the "please don't be mad at us" fixes that they had implimented earlier
[3:18:49] <%BrazenMask> YAAAAAY GOO
[3:18:50] <%TeraMercier> @Sphincter_Spelunker You're totally right, I forgot it turned into comic book spinoff level nonsense by the end
[3:18:50] <dking0000> Could Joe Baker beat Mr X in a fist fight?
[3:18:51] <%Kahnicus> WHO'S
[3:18:51] <Beef_Broganoff> Yeah @VantomPayne I think you're right
[3:18:51] <+Sxy_T_Rex> Joe Baker comes in and suplexes Mr. X
[3:18:51] <%Ahack13> Fuck the goo hallway.
[3:18:52] <Worldbrand> that's what we're calling it now?
[3:18:52] <+Blackgaver> half hour ResidentSleeper

[3:19:02] <%sjay449> I hate the goo hallway
[3:19:02] <dking0000> Could he just powerbomb mr x ?

[3:19:08] <+Blackgaver> hiaaaarg
[3:19:09] <Beef_Broganoff> What if Kuze was in the goo hallway
[3:19:09] <%TeraMercier> The goo hallway seems inspired by the Revelations section where there's an infected pool on the ship
[3:19:10] <+Blackgaver> heeeeu

[3:24:55] <+runegod20> the shotgun just works better as a zombie instant kill weapon but only when you have the upgrade

[3:25:26] <Beef_Broganoff> @Aztec50 Their claws are too big to grab the door and using their tongue to turn the handle would be unsanitary

[3:25:47] <gustavozxd> @theenablerr he either moved really fast or was teleporting idk
[3:25:48] <mastermidget23> So, am I wrong in feeling like the shotgun is an absolute middle child in this game? Too pricy to use on zombies, not powerful enough on bosses? If I get h-gun powder, I always save it for magnum rounds.
[3:25:49] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @connos_livereview I don't understand how she has a huge fanbase cause she's only in two games

[3:26:37] <gustavozxd> @mastermidget23 I just use it to make sure zombies stay dead, outside from that it does seem awkwardly weak
[3:26:37] <Brandon__Brando> Time to talk MAD SHIT about pat now that hes gone
[3:26:39] <TheEnablerr> @gustavozxd that would make the photo blurry so that can't be the explanation
[3:26:40] <%Kahnicus> @mastermidget23 Mebbe it's more useful in 2nd run Leon where ammo is scarcer?
[3:26:41] <%FrustratedAF> it'd be cool if pat could get a nightbot or something for quotes
[3:26:42] <JDRK> @mastermidget23 more or less, on my Leon B run I used it like exclusively on zombies

[3:26:48] <DrMoose7> these jams
[3:26:50] <+runegod20> it's better for bosses than the normal handgun unless you want to piss bullets burst firing, but it's no so valueable that you don't want to waste it on zombies
[3:26:53] <mastermidget23> @runegod20 What do you find yourself using it on?
[3:26:59] <$SleepyMaribo> Why does Elmo have a Box cutter?

[3:37:38] <InugamiTheHound> redwall mother fuckers!!
[3:37:40] <%TeraMercier> @AngriestPat Is the goosebumps why you're so scared of everything
[3:37:40] <%Kahnicus> Animorphs was actually pretty good...
[3:37:41] <%rdark_ksu> Man i loved the hell out of the Narnia books as a kid
[3:37:43] <%Shikari21> the guy who finished it is great
[3:37:47] <OwlLightningMage> I wished I read Animorphs as a kid after hearing how raw it was as an adult.
[3:37:47] <%ElenaManetta> I'm moderately attractive, yes
[3:37:47] <nobody12349> He died because you stopped reading
[3:37:47] <Zombrocom> Sanderson did really well finishing it
[3:37:50] <%FrustratedAF> netflix is gonna grab animorphs, i'm calling it
[3:37:50] <%mostundesired> Wait, time out, Wheel of Time is YA?
[3:37:50] <%Shikari21> i love his mistborn series
[3:37:50] <Nighthawkmun> My name is Perrin irl
[3:37:51] <%TaifuDragon> Brandon Sanderson finished it, right/
[3:37:51] <Ir_ramble> liked Clive Barker's stuff as a kid
[3:37:54] <42nfl19> is pat taking a break or is he done?
[3:37:54] <$Piemono> I'm listening to the series over on audible
[3:37:57] <+metalsiren31> That's exactly the same path I took with Wheel of Time
[3:37:57] <Xenstroke> I was an Artimis Fowl book fan
[3:37:58] <+Verd_254> Hatchet, just the first one. Didn't read much as a kid.
[3:37:59] <%FrustratedAF> maybe adi shankar can save animorphs Jebaited
[3:38:01] <$SGrim> @mostundesired kind of. the themes fit, but the narractive is so convoluted it might break youthful brains.

[3:39:20] <%DJFakie> Yep, Aigis, EDF announcer, etc.
[3:39:23] <TheHeroAppears> she's also aigis
[3:39:25] <DSD24> She's also Kitana
[3:39:26] <+Puppet88> wait is Annette not Laura Bailey?
[3:39:28] <%MisterCrimson> Everyday's great at your G-VIRUS
[3:39:29] <FeedbacK7777> What the fuck did i just walk in on. that's crazy to hear LUL
[3:39:30] <Ir_ramble> Thought Paige was Annette
[3:39:36] <+Dr_DangerPhD> That Atari boxing game is pretty legit though
[3:39:38] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@valriot)
[3:39:39] <+jjjkopf> also Aigis
[3:39:41] <+Devilbringer133> I need Annette to say My Armor
[3:39:41] <+runegod20> everytime i heard her VO it always sounded the exact same to me
[3:39:43] <%TeraMercier> It's not so much that Pong doesn't hold up, more that we're used to more complicated goals in games
[3:39:45] <OwlLightningMage> Annette sounds nothing like Laura Bailey.
[3:39:48] <%ThatGuyfromMars> wow mind = blown
[3:39:48] <Darlington_the_Deceiver> AIGIS WAIT
[3:39:48] <LiquidMathew> She's also a cute redhead too!
[3:39:49] <DSD24> She's also the Thief in Disgaea
[3:39:53] <%Hazard_Kujacker> @Puppet88 nope
[3:40:00] <+harambi> USA
[3:40:00] <TafferAA> who's HUNK? he sounds familiar
[3:40:02] <+Maids4lyfe> Annette isn't played by Laura Bailey
[3:40:03] <+Tentacruelty_> She also played Alexia in Darkside Chronicles
[3:40:04] <OwlLightningMage> Oh you LUL
[3:40:08] <%TeraMercier> If Pong had a speed slider it would hold up forever with two competitive players
[3:40:09] <+RageCasanova> is this the beginning of stream or the end?
[3:40:11] <lionandfox21> I was 4 or 3 when RE2 came out and I remember the classic music so much it probably influenced my taste in music lol

[3:40:39] <+Spikyshrike> @AngriestPat Joseph Anderson begs to disagree
[3:40:39] <%ElenaManetta> The RE2 rain is really relaxing
[3:40:40] <dekkitout> pretentious? 45-70 minutes
[3:40:44] <+pleasenameyourcharacter> The longer, the better
[3:40:44] <A_Zealous_Retort> oh hey she was in FUCKING OMIKRON TOO
[3:40:46] <+Verd_254> you have to be at least 20min to be pretentious in the first place.
[3:40:46] <%ElenaManetta> I think you should always have rain sounds playing on your streams
[3:40:50] <%topendbuzz> I can go hours GO DEEP IN THERE
[3:40:51] <OwlLightningMage> Make it a commentary track over the entire game
[3:40:54] <blademaster247> Talk for an hour about why FFXV is bad
[3:40:54] <dekkitout> actually good, anything under 40
[3:40:55] <ebonifragaria> @ElenaManetta I thought that was my tinnitus LUL

[3:46:05] <%MisterCrimson> @AngriestPat alright, so I had a great idea for a DLC mode for RE2 where weapons are replaced by cards and you have to build a deck to handle the situation. Also every bullet is a card and you can only have 12 cards in a deck

[3:51:47] <+dickbuttwoman> Avoiding and running through is the best solution

[3:51:50] <hypercolourdeathmachine> ive been calling it the tumour dumpster but you do you
[3:51:57] <%Kahnicus> And just face vomit poison you
[3:51:57] <Ion_LaserX> It looks like a giant shit monster
[3:51:59] <Geno4344> aw yeah get the poo poo water in those wounds
[3:52:00] <%ThePuddingDead> Do you think these monsters are the dumped corpses of the orphans?
[3:52:02] <ObsidianDragon86> These things are silent hill looking motherfukers
[3:52:04] <Beef_Broganoff> I still haven't seen a death animation with that grab and I sure hope I never do
[3:52:06] <+runegod20> flash and frags could get you through every encounter in the game if you were willing to go through them

[3:52:27] <%TeraMercier> @king_wragles Yeah, I think you're right
[3:52:29] <+Blackgaver> pat poison is bad
[3:52:29] <thebehatted> YOU THINK IT'S OVER
[3:52:30] <%Grazerite> RIP
[3:52:30] <%Implosivestar> The goo pit? Oh, the dead orphan sewer
[3:52:31] <%Kahnicus> @ThePuddingDead They're called G-Adult in the models, so I'm thinking not
[3:52:31] <+RageCasanova> nightmare*
[3:52:33] <Beef_Broganoff> Really brave of Leon to just shove his fist all up in there
[3:52:40] <%connos_livereview> birkins spawning pit
[3:52:41] <%TeraMercier> I was always just holding a combined herb by now
[3:52:42] <+ArcLifth> also poisoned
[3:52:47] <%DirtyGaijin> @ThePuddingDead they are imperfect g creatures from Birkin trying to reproduce
[3:52:47] <talfurt> what are those enemies mutated from
[3:52:49] <ShichiNoBushi> "squelch"
[3:52:49] <benjiFG> at least you're not poisoned or anything
[3:52:50] <%pleasenameyourcharacter> You survived the Mt Dew, well done!
[3:52:50] <TikanZK> wait im stupid and never played these games, how come leon and claire and all them dont get infected?
[3:52:50] <TafferAA> did you get the raccoon
[3:52:52] <+dickbuttwoman> There's a blue down there
[3:52:53] <$Big_King_Coconut> that was the third gooiest hallway I've ever seen
[3:52:53] <%Zhesbe> Gotta get that herb
[3:52:55] <%Tearonex> theres a blue herb in there]
[3:52:57] <germanmafia23> missed blue
[3:52:58] <%Bredirish123> G creatures are rats right?
[3:53:05] <reddeadwine1277> He has to prove to himself that he can use those fist strats for Ada.
[3:53:05] <+dickbuttwoman> Left
[3:53:06] <+lazerbear77> why isnt leaon SUPER infected now?
[3:53:06] <%Kahnicus> Get the bluest herb!
[3:53:09] <whalewoof> these addidas ads are the worst lol
[3:53:09] <Naho_Saenoki> @TikanZK Because canonically, they never got hit or bit.
[3:53:10] <%lewdskeletor13> @tikanzk Canonically they never get bitten
[3:53:13] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @TikanZK cuz shhhhhhh.
[3:53:15] <TafferAA> begone toxin!
[3:53:15] <TikanZK> ahh kk thanks
[3:53:18] <+Nomicro4u> Pat too toxic for Leon
[3:53:19] <%griffball13> ! TOXIC !
[3:53:19] <%king_wragles> Leon needs to rub onions on his thighs
[3:53:20] <dekkitout> oh no, leon played a game of overwatch
[3:53:23] <+Devilbringer133> @TikanZK Player convenience
[3:53:28] <%Kahnicus> G+R+B = Med-X
[3:53:31] <%king_wragles> for the toxins
[3:53:35] <Bradley117> If you're in caution health i don't think they can poison you
[3:53:35] <%DJFakie> You know, I finished Leon A and I never once got poisoned. It was weird.
[3:53:35] <%TeraMercier> @TikanZK Plot armor, or they never canon got infected, or my favorite, the idea that the infection just advances general injury and only changes you on death
[3:53:36] <majindusto> G- creatures are now the worst thing to exist by making more than one of em be a thing!
[3:53:49] <%king_wragles> Ya, @Kahnicus does blue even do anything on its own?
[3:53:50] <%connos_livereview> wish i could monch a blue herb and clear my body poison
[3:53:53] <Beef_Broganoff> I still have yet to get poisoned, don't know how
[3:53:58] <Beef_Broganoff> On playthrough 3 rn
[3:53:59] <+RageCasanova> when i played this segment i totally fucked up and forgot the flamethrower
[3:54:04] <ShichiNoBushi> Eff you, zombie.
[3:54:05] <%DirtyGaijin> Ive only seen the G monsters poison in this game
[3:54:07] <TafferAA> eh its standard who cares
[3:54:11] <%Kahnicus> @king_wragles It heals poison, but obviously way better when combined with red.
[3:54:11] <FeedbacK7777> Sweet baby
[3:54:14] <ebonifragaria> emmo
[3:54:19] <%TeraMercier> The blue herb says it strengthens constitution, what does that mean?
[3:54:19] <OToole42> emlo
[3:54:19] <+Nomicro4u> Aww he paw
[3:54:19] <%king_wragles> huh, neat
[3:54:21] <%ElenaManetta> Hi kitty!
[3:54:21] <%valriot> Best gun
[3:54:21] <Guardiansaiyan> @Illucination congrats!
[3:54:26] <Beef_Broganoff> Murble
[3:54:28] <%DirtyGaijin> Blue used to cure poison
[3:54:28] <%Zhesbe> apatElmo apatElmo
[3:54:28] <+dickbuttwoman> Backwards
[3:54:29] <%ElenaManetta> Elmo wants to cuddle
[3:54:30] <%lewdskeletor13> God I love cats
[3:54:30] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @TeraMercier damage reduction, I think
[3:54:33] <+Alig200> @TeraMercier temporary damage/poison resistance buff
[3:54:34] <hlreiku> Nya
[3:54:36] <+dickbuttwoman> Grab that!
[3:54:38] <Beef_Broganoff> It is Elmo time
[3:54:40] <Nighthawkmun> THEBOY
[3:54:42] <+RageCasanova> if you mix blue and red herb you can get a defense buff.
[3:54:43] <%TeraMercier> It actually does something! Cool to know
[3:54:43] <arcaderabbit48> So how is the flamthrower in this game? Because it seems super solid for a video game flamthrower
[3:54:45] <+Nomicro4u> He want affection
[3:54:47] <+NoGoodAtGames> This speedrunner is terrible
[3:54:47] <%WheatlyXT> Shadowwwwww puzzzzzllleeedd
[3:54:47] <Hellarussian> Big Amnesia
[3:54:49] <+Blackgaver> miaaaw
[3:54:49] <+RageCasanova> CON BUFF = Def
[3:54:49] <reddeadwine1277> big fluff
[3:54:50] <%DJFakie> The damage reduction is for like a minute as well, it's pretty good.
[3:54:51] <Beef_Broganoff> [rubba rubba]
[3:54:51] <Naho_Saenoki> @DirtyGaijin Blue still cures poison. It just also increases defense when combined with red now.
[3:54:55] <%ElenaManetta> He's grandpa but also your son
[3:54:55] <Sinister_Aglet> SCREM
[3:54:55] <Desertfishing> elmo looms over pat
[3:54:56] <SiameseSneeze> Big boy screms
[3:54:59] <%Kahnicus> @TeraMercier It heals poison, and allows you to resist poison, but when combined with red herb, gives you damage resistance
[3:55:01] <%TeraMercier> @arcaderabbit48 It's most useful specifically on the plant monsters
[3:55:01] <%ElenaManetta> He's your own grandpa!!
[3:55:01] <Predatorhahaha23000> he calls
[3:55:02] <ScreamingMeat> Elmo cries
[3:55:02] <%king_wragles> and from what I know, red just doubles the effect of whatever it's combined with
[3:55:03] <Shwepie> LUL
[3:55:04] <%rumtumtugnutz> elmo wants hobbit dad's attention
[3:55:05] <%Das_Bass> apatWink
[3:55:06] <ebonifragaria> He scream right into your ear
[3:55:07] <Beef_Broganoff> [screams directly into your ear]
[3:55:07] <%pleasenameyourcharacter> Oh, Elmo just reminded me, anybody here seen sad cat diary?
[3:55:07] <Gruhunchously> What's the best flamethrower in all of video games?
[3:55:11] <reddeadwine1277> He's teaching Elmo naughty words....
[3:55:13] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Someone pet that child for the love of all holy
[3:55:19] <%lewdskeletor13> He’s a baby son grandpa? @angriestpat
[3:55:22] <thebehatted> kill them all elmo
[3:55:22] <%TeraMercier> I only ever used blue in a completely combined herb, so I never knew
[3:55:23] <%Bredirish123> That ham needs some honks
[3:55:24] <%DirtyGaijin> elmo just wants love
[3:55:25] <Desertfishing> elmo gets need when close to bed time
[3:55:27] <%BioApple> elmo has the real t virus - toxoplasmosis
[3:55:28] <majindusto> Like a Shark
[3:55:28] <%walternatorz> Elmo Mr. X
[3:55:28] <Gruhunchously> Is this child abuse?
[3:55:33] <ebonifragaria> He wants daddy
[3:55:35] <TafferAA> RACCOON
[3:55:37] <%DJFakie> Uh, this game's flamethrower is pretty good. I've merc'd a few crowds with the flamethrower endgame.
[3:55:38] <TafferAA> i heard it
[3:55:38] <%TeraMercier> @Gruhunchously The one in World at War was pretty brutal
[3:55:40] <arcaderabbit48> @TeraMercier I figured as much. How is it on the bosses themselves? Its really hard to tell if it was damaging them at all when Pat was roasting them
[3:55:44] <Gruhunchously> Or is it elder abuse?
[3:55:46] <+Blackgaver> big poopoo alley
[3:55:48] <%king_wragles> @TeraMercier I think you can only get poisoned in the sewer?
[3:55:54] <%Zhesbe> Can y'all imagine if Mr. X meowed menacingly
[3:55:54] <reddeadwine1277> da wheezing
[3:55:55] <+dickbuttwoman> sbfpSetIn
[3:55:55] <%3xgilly> That sounds horrible
[3:55:57] <%ElenaManetta> Holy shit it's almost midnight
[3:55:57] <dekkitout> i am the legendary super saiyan, son granpa
[3:56:00] <%valriot> @arcaderabbit48 You can basically hard low G2 fight and one phase it using a flash nade and just dumping on him with the flamethrower
[3:56:00] <ObsidianDragon86> All I hear in this shit pit swere is Awoooo!
[3:56:00] <+dickbuttwoman> One last one
[3:56:01] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@majindusto) (warning)
[3:56:02] <%DirtyGaijin> Only the G-Units can poison
[3:56:03] <%MisterCrimson> you...did it
[3:56:04] <Darlington_the_Deceiver> Elmo wants in on the poop water
[3:56:08] <%Tearonex> not done yet
[3:56:08] <%lewdskeletor13> DOING IT
[3:56:08] <garbageheaphound> you can do it
[3:56:10] <%FracturedImage> you did it apatDab
[3:56:11] <%king_wragles> so like, you wouldn't use it that much on its own tbh
[3:56:11] <+dickbuttwoman> Good shit
[3:56:13] <Hellarussian> WE DO IT
[3:56:14] <Desertfishing> sounds and looks like my exwife
[3:56:15] <%DirtyGaijin> apatDab apatDab apatDab apatDab
[3:56:17] <arcaderabbit48> @valriot That's really cool, thank you
[3:56:18] <%DJFakie> You get an upgrade for the flamethrower that makes it uses ammo half as fast super late.
[3:56:20] <%Tearonex> nice
[3:56:20] <%Kahnicus> Juked that G adfult
[3:56:22] <%Kahnicus> adult
[3:56:23] <ProRJHunter> YEYE
[3:56:24] <ObsidianDragon86> You didnt shoot not a one
[3:56:25] <garbageheaphound> you.....did it
[3:56:25] <%ShiftyFish> I only just realized there aren't any spiders in this game.
[3:56:28] <Desertfishing> and i never been married Kappa
[3:56:28] <%Grazerite> apatDab apatDab
[3:56:29] <%superxinvader> yassss
[3:56:34] <Guardiansaiyan> The retro music really helps with the atmosphere
[3:56:34] <$Kyupo> yay
[3:56:36] <%TeraMercier> You get a chunk of fuel in the last G fight, but generally I didn't fuck around with using it on bosses. The plant monsters are fucking regenerators from RE4, so I feel like the flamethrower is best on them
[3:56:38] <arcaderabbit48> Man, look at all this orphan bio-mass. Surprised an infection didn't occur sooner, Christ
[3:56:42] <%connos_livereview> boutta pass out from injury chat goodnight sweet princes and such
[3:56:43] <%Tearonex> he used a knife and a grenade, good shit Pat
[3:56:43] <%ThePuddingDead> Nick: "Blood aint easy getting outta wedding dress.......don't ask me how I know that."
[3:56:43] <%ElenaManetta> Is Paige talking? Unironically WHO'S TALKING?
[3:56:45] <%superxinvader> so question, have you thought about doing a No HUD run?
[3:56:45] <JJMR322> you did it
[3:56:46] <Naho_Saenoki> @ShiftyFish That's probably why the G-Adults cause poison now.
[3:56:51] <+RageCasanova> TAKE THAT BLIGHT TOWN
[3:56:53] <%lewdskeletor13> Paige is so quiet
[3:56:55] <%king_wragles> Who's talking?
[3:56:58] <%All_Salt> Doesn't Pat need the thing on the way back
[3:56:59] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Mic Paige
[3:57:00] <$Kyupo> We survived the wolly hole
[3:57:02] <Intolerable> EAT THE MIC PAIGE
[3:57:03] <+Blackgaver> @king_wragles nobody
[3:57:07] <%DJFakie> There's a hidden full fuel tank in the police office too.
[3:57:10] <%lewdskeletor13> SWALLOW THAT MIC
[3:57:16] <%TeraMercier> @king_wragles Yeah, pretty sure that's the only place. I had shitloads of spare blue herbs at this point
[3:57:17] <%cureneckbeard> om nom mic
[3:57:20] <Dieworc> man fuck that bear!
[3:57:21] <%valriot> king queen pawn, bishop rook knight
[3:57:21] <+Maids4lyfe> lol
[3:57:24] <Ir_ramble> Did Pat get the Racoon figure in the sewer?
[3:57:24] <TafferAA> da bear
[3:57:26] <Hellarussian> i clapped when i saw the alligator
[3:57:27] <%Kahnicus> I think of the living island Krakoa. It was a mutant.
[3:57:28] <%TeraMercier> Condomed 2
[3:57:29] <CrabSlacks> Does this have the giant moth?
[3:57:29] <ObsidianDragon86> Oh god the Rabies Bear
[3:57:30] <%maskedriderhero> Devour the recording equipment Paige
[3:57:34] <InugamiTheHound> i love the bear scene from condemned 2
[3:57:34] <+Blackgaver> it was un-BEARable
[3:57:38] <%ElenaManetta> The Lost bear
[3:57:39] <SplatterAte> Just got here and got an ad for KH3, what a game series I've play before that I could care less about.
[3:57:40] <%DJFakie> They honestly give you a lot of fuel to work with, I had plenty of spare.
[3:57:40] <ObsidianDragon86> Still not as scary as the Annihilation Bear
[3:57:43] <$TheNeedlesD> Da Bears
[3:57:44] <%TeraMercier> That's the opposite of that Dead Space story for the tentacle
[3:57:46] <ObsidianDragon86> FUCK that bear
[3:57:47] <%Corporate_Redeemer> We need more bears in vidya games
[3:57:48] <%lewdskeletor13> Have you guys read the part about the bear yet?
[3:57:53] <+Maids4lyfe> but what inspired the alligator?
[3:57:53] <majindusto> G-Creatures are literally a huge problem and now I understand nuking the city
[3:57:55] <JJMR322> leonardo dicaprio has something to say about bears
[3:57:56] <Gruhunchously> Funny thing is, this music feels like a dark version of the Vigil theme from Mass Effect.
[3:58:00] <+Blackgaver> bear grills would have handled that bear better Kappa
[3:58:00] <%king_wragles> I don't remember the bear
[3:58:01] <%FracturedImage> stream it?
[3:58:04] <romanticzomedy> i've never heard of Condemned
[3:58:06] <waifoong98> Rip Condemn
[3:58:06] <TafferAA> bears are the scariest
[3:58:11] <dekkitout> aint no bear scarier than a cave bear
[3:58:11] <%ThePuddingDead> shame condemned got a REALLY shitty port to PC
[3:58:12] <+runegod20> i only know of the original
[3:58:12] <%ElenaManetta> I thought Paige couldnt handle first person horror
[3:58:14] <%riantDeliration> all I know about Condemned is its the game with that One Creepy Mannequin Room
[3:58:16] <%TeraMercier> I'd be down for a Condemned stream from one of these two
[3:58:19] <%ThePuddingDead> or was that 2?
[3:58:21] <%DirtyGaijin> Im getting worked up that he hasnt mixed those herbs
[3:58:22] <LiquidMathew> Condemned had that weird vocal plot that was kinda lame
[3:58:24] <InugamiTheHound> got all the achievements for both games
[3:58:25] <romanticzomedy> Oh WOW that sounds rad
[3:58:27] <+Nomicro4u> I think most people where too young to play it lmao
[3:58:29] <%Ml33tninja> MOST of 2 is great!!
[3:58:29] <Ion_LaserX> Was that a Xbox 360 launch title?
[3:58:30] <waifoong98> They played it on the channel lads
[3:58:30] <reddeadwine1277> so the bear asked the rabbit; Do you have trouble with shit sticking to your fur?...
[3:58:31] <%trnzero> Come on Crazy Talk, you can do it
[3:58:32] <ebonifragaria> I've only heard of it 'cause of Zero Punctuation
[3:58:33] <%ElenaManetta> You get a stick
[3:58:33] <faegbeard> survival whorey?
[3:58:33] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Man, enough of Remasters. Make a sequel
[3:58:34] <%Kahnicus> It was real XBoxy
[3:58:35] <+Verd_254> condemned is a hobo horror simulator
[3:58:36] <Junkfist> The second one is when it got weird and you had to skyrim shout at people?
[3:58:36] <Riki_Mau> first person hobo fights
[3:58:38] <foreverN2dust> Paige beat something first person?
[3:58:38] <%lewdskeletor13> Yeah I don’t know anything about it
[3:58:38] <Gruhunchously> First Person Bludgeoner
[3:58:38] <Desertfishing> wasnt there some bullshit with that game like people freaking out about it
[3:58:38] <%Tearonex> It was a 360 launch game
[3:58:38] <%3xgilly> purse fursin
[3:58:39] <%ElenaManetta> And like... A camera?
[3:58:41] <%Ml33tninja> one is outstanding for its time!
[3:58:41] <%king_wragles> Wait... Condemnded isn't that one game where you're in a dream world?
[3:58:44] <majindusto> I heard of it...Never played it
[3:58:45] <%TeraMercier> You get a gun off and on I think
[3:58:45] <Wisconsinite> Condemned is one of my favorite horror games. So good.
[3:58:45] <A_Zealous_Retort> first person hobo horror
[3:58:48] <%ElenaManetta> That was one of the first shitstorms
[3:58:49] <%TheMilhouseExperience> You mean the xbone rwverse compatibility?
[3:58:50] <%Grazerite> you fight a lot of hobos in condemmedd
[3:58:51] <%Das_Bass> you get guns but like no ammo
[3:58:52] <+runegod20> the biggest thing i remember of the game is that there's a glitch where if you don't get the achievement during your first playthrough where you never use a gun, the game gltiches out and you can't get anymore achievements
[3:58:52] <Slasher9485> Peach have you seen Pyrocyincal's video on Condemned 1?
[3:58:55] <+Maids4lyfe> are we talking about the guy who investigates murders, Condemned Criminal Origins?
[3:58:56] <%king_wragles> I thought that was 3rd person
[3:58:57] <SiameseSneeze> Beat the hit out of people with lead pipes and your fists
[3:58:57] <%Keyd00d> shitstorm FeelsBadMan
[3:58:59] <%valriot> @angriestpat Stand to the side of the bucket between the junvtion box to cheese this first part
[3:58:59] <%DirtyGaijin> You can get a way with using next to no ammo on this fight
[3:58:59] <%Das_Bass> I love that game
[3:59:00] <InugamiTheHound> you get gun in condemned 1 but not all ammo
[3:59:00] <+Yokuho> Condemned is garbage, you can't be serious
[3:59:01] <$TheNeedlesD> Gun doesn't last very long, great launch title for the 360 and its backwards compatible on the Xbone.
[3:59:02] <%king_wragles> I must be high
[3:59:03] <%Corporate_Redeemer> It's a horror game with detective elements to it
[3:59:05] <JJMR322> damn it... we arent getting any more shitstorms...
[3:59:05] <%ThatGuyfromMars> is condemned the one with all the mannequins?
[3:59:06] <majindusto> Shitstorm BibleThump
[3:59:06] <Dementedpenguin> Condemned 1 was a fun experience when it first came out.
[3:59:08] <+Blackgaver> how high do you recommend it?
[3:59:10] <Tracazoid> You get guns but they're super limited on ammo, a few shots before you throw them on the ground for a pipe.
[3:59:10] <arcaderabbit48> Literally the only thing I know abotu Condemned is the name, and that people mention it a lot
[3:59:10] <thebehatted> is it that one Cryostasis game?
[3:59:10] <%ElenaManetta> It's an ollld game. It's one of those horror games that helped popularize the "Stream people playing horror games and freaking out" genre
[3:59:11] <+Verd_254> the mannequins in condemned 1 ScaredyCat
[3:59:12] <%ThePuddingDead> yeah it is guy
[3:59:13] <SiameseSneeze> shit*
[3:59:14] <%MisterCrimson> You know what needs a remake? Breath of Fire 6. By which I mean they need to scrap that mobile horseshit and make a real fucking game
[3:59:14] <%Bredirish123> I won't lie, I'm gonna miss Shitstorms
[3:59:17] <%Kahnicus> @ThatGuyfromMars Yeah, I think so
[3:59:19] <%TeraMercier> I feel like this next fight is WAYY less reliable as Claire
[3:59:25] <Darlington_the_Deceiver> shitstorm FeelsBirthdayMan
[3:59:25] <%valriot> The bucket to the right of the box
[3:59:25] <ShichiNoBushi> I heard it as "blood-geon" like a dungeon with (a lot of) blood.
[3:59:26] <Slasher9485> Pyrocyincal did a one hour video all about condemned
[3:59:31] <%Ml33tninja> LOVE condemned one!
[3:59:35] <waifoong98> spyCheese

[4:02:21] <+AXL808> just your regular old museum flamethrower
[4:02:24] <thebehatted> is it possible to kill him without the shipping container?
[4:02:28] <%DirtyGaijin> no crane?
[4:02:28] <%TeraMercier> Any reason he's actually fighting here? Anybody know?
[4:02:29] <%ElenaManetta> Who am I to question Patrick Boivin: RE2 Expert (Title still pending)
[4:02:31] <MyNameIsRasus> We cheevo hunting?
[4:02:31] <JDRK> he's probably going for the achievement for damaging him enough that he dies to one crane hit
[4:02:32] <+chrimbooooo> i bet i can use the crane
[4:02:35] <+Yokuho> he got it
[4:02:37] <Nova712> one and done
[4:02:38] <Firesparks> birkin, you're small time
[4:02:40] <majindusto> Begone Birkenstock!
[4:02:42] <%DJFakie> There's an achievement for only using the crane once.
[4:02:43] <couch_potato_Ed_Boy> I like my Birkin well done, with a side of Horse radish.
[4:02:45] <+Alig200> @TeraMercier acid rounds give i-frames if you keep Claire close to him when you shoot them. You can also just abuse his flying claw attack and do this without using any ammo.
[4:02:45] <CrabSlacks> Now I've got your power!
[4:02:45] <$MajorCrasher> that's a colossal waste of ammo
[4:02:45] <%TeraMercier> Oh, the achievement? Gotcha
[4:02:45] <%DirtyGaijin> Bitch Birkin
[4:02:47] <%maskedriderhero> Amazing how Pat has already played this enough to pretty much memorize the game
[4:02:48] <TafferAA> he was almost dead should've just finished normally
[4:02:48] <Nova712> GG lobosHype
[4:02:49] <%lewdskeletor13> There’s an achievement for only using the crane once
[4:02:50] <%ThePuddingDead> huh
[4:02:50] <TheTrueZyozz> Hey, Pat. I just finished streaming my run of the Minimalist achievement. I streamed it as well and have it in the archives of my channel. If you'd like to use it for reference, feel free to. It was done in 4:15:##.

[4:02:55] <Beef_Broganoff> Merkin' Birkin
[4:03:00] <+tigerfang86> NOT TUFF ENUFF
[4:03:02] <%willjar313> How's it feel, Birkin? To be a BITCH.
[4:03:02] <%king_wragles> wow
[4:03:04] <Nova712> lobosFalling
[4:03:07] <%Ahack13> I didn't know you could do it in one crane hit. Cool.

[4:03:08] <Flunkorg> wait he actually has an HP pool?
[4:03:09] <TheTrueZyozz> For the Minimalist achievement.

[4:03:16] <%RPG_CHICAGO> apatLiz apatLiz apatLiz apatLiz apatLiz
[4:03:17] <BeefyQueefer> Part of his model was clipping through the giant eyeball, 0/10 do not buy.
[4:03:18] <+Verd_254> so if you do enough damage it skips the first one where he climbs back up eh
[4:03:19] <thebehatted> spoilers: it wasn't
[4:03:19] <%TeraMercier> Acid grenades give I frames? Not flame ones?

[4:08:35] <%TeraMercier> Why are you bringing these?
[4:08:36] <SplatterAte> @Corporate_Redeemer I'm mad I didn't think of that
[4:08:37] <+Puppet88> its outside in the goo room isnt it?
[4:08:44] <%stolando_florida> It's too bad that Capcom can't make reasonable female models and Claire looks like a dumb bimbo RealDoll with no facial expression
[4:08:45] <+Puppet88> not in the actual room where you got the keys
[4:08:48] <%DirtyGaijin> Thats why he needs to shoot them all
[4:08:50] <%nademonkey1100> dat ass?
[4:08:59] <+Meiou> @Typhaeon too bad. elmos going to evolve into a raccoon and haunt him forever
[4:09:05] <Jrockoni> wow the old soundtrack is great
[4:09:09] <+dickbuttwoman> It isn't in the goo room, it's in the storage room itself, right before the entrance door to the room proper I beleive
[4:09:13] <Guardiansaiyan> Shoot them ALL
[4:09:16] <%pleasenameyourcharacter> @legendscar01 my question is would they sell it as a blueprint or a product
[4:09:16] <%topendbuzz> apatWrong
[4:09:16] <%Kahnicus> So, I'm an architect, how can I my work exclusively to my monmania and make it a bitch for everyone else on the fucking planet? I KNOW. CHESS ELECTRICITY.
[4:09:17] <reonome> @stolando_florida ada looks great tho
[4:09:22] <thelonechris> Back into the bloody poop
[4:09:25] <+Puppet88> game too good with classic ost
[4:09:28] <%stolando_florida> @reonome Ada does look good but that's one out of many
[4:09:34] <%TeraMercier> Man, the old sountrack feels so natural that I routinely forget until everybody else mentions it again
[4:09:41] <reonome> annette is fine
[4:09:41] <Guardiansaiyan> @Kahnicus Don't forget the crests and shitty keys hidden everywhere!

[4:10:24] <Hellarussian> BrainSlug
[4:10:26] <%pleasenameyourcharacter> i feel like selling how to make the virus would be catastrophic, but selling it premade keeps it reigned in

[4:16:41] <Ion_LaserX> that zombie is enjoying that salad
[4:16:48] <%TeraMercier> @SplatterAte It'll only give you like two, maybe three saves if you don't knife anything manually, and always retrieve it. It's a very perishable asset
[4:16:52] <%Bredirish123> Ass is a part of a well balanced diet
[4:16:52] <+Blackgaver> poop juiice

[4:17:13] <majindusto> Aigis?
[4:17:13] <%pleasenameyourcharacter> @teramercier to start over, i'm baffled mostly at how Umbrella plans to make money, not what the customers do. like, if they sell the formula, then there's no repeat business. but if they sell it by the vial, they'd likely run out of customers fairly quick due to accidents, death of clients, or even full blown apocalypse. badically, "who thought this was a good idea?"
[4:17:17] <thebehatted> THE BABY
[4:17:17] <thelonechris> I thought you were talking about the flamethrower for a second
[4:17:19] <Darlington_the_Deceiver> Elmo will remember that

[4:17:28] <%Corporate_Redeemer> The Ass-Eating Virus will be in RE8

[4:18:02] <taptapmuhgap> @pleasenameyourcharacter but see then umbrella does what all companies are trying to do. With everyone dead they effectively control all the money in the world

[4:18:06] <%TeraMercier> @pleasenameyourcharacter It's the single hardest actual thing for me to recommend about this game. It's really incredible and realistic, except if you think at all about any of the villain's motivations
[4:18:08] <%Niney_Who> The other is Mr. X
[4:18:10] <%Corporate_Redeemer> Don't kinkshame

[4:28:56] <%topendbuzz> clickers vs lickers. who wins?
[4:29:01] <RiverBirch> Dark Souls 2 V1 is just Dark Souls 2A
[4:29:02] <majindusto> Are they the stronger BLACK LICKERS?
[4:29:12] <RiverBirch> Dark Souls 2 Scholar of hte First Sin is just Dark Souls 2B
[4:29:20] <Naho_Saenoki> @topendbuzz Lickers are faster and stronger, with more range.
[4:29:20] <+RageCasanova> is there a dedicated quick turn in this game?
[4:29:22] <+Giantcanaloupe34> @topendbuzz def clickers
[4:29:23] <%legendscar01> Just kill them pat
[4:29:23] <Gruhunchously> Black liqueurs
[4:29:28] <%pleasenameyourcharacter> chat, what determines if a body becomes a zombie pr is just eaten by a zombie? do they have to be alive to turn or am i just overthinking it?
[4:29:28] <allanmiri> Lickers beat CLickers any day
[4:29:29] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> A 180, yeah
[4:29:31] <+DK_Rance> @topendbuzz witch ones though theres lots of clickers ? we talkin blind stage ?

[4:29:37] <+RageCasanova> huh
[4:29:37] <TafferAA> there's no black lickers because regular lickers already hit like trucks
[4:29:38] <$Wafflum> Last Mr Raccoon if you still need it is in the Nap Room after you power it up in one of the beds.

[4:34:31] <MattDemers> Hey @AngriestPat do you think that Mouse Aim would make this significantly easier?
[4:34:33] <TheTrueZyozz> Use the flamethrower. You don't need to shoot their bulbs.
[4:34:34] <%SilvaChariot0133> "A little"
[4:34:34] <+RushUnplugged> CWISPY
[4:34:35] <+Yokuho> Takes 60

[4:34:38] <%legendscar01> So pat, do same rules apply to getting a s rank?
[4:34:41] <+DGenerator> It takes 60 with patience
[4:34:41] <%willjar313> TOASTY!
[4:34:45] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@QueequegTheater) (warning)
[4:34:49] <+Yokuho> Just 60 bud
[4:34:50] <+x24sonic> 6o with patience is correct
[4:34:50] <Naho_Saenoki> @Maids4lyfe I kinda think it's supposed to be reminiscent of both ofld detective noir films AND Sebastian Castellanos.
[4:34:50] <majindusto> Shame the same Can't be said for the quality of Claire's Nostalgia costume BibleThump
[4:34:51] <JJMR322> 60 if ur good at the game
[4:34:52] <%BioApple> Can't you just puff him once, wait for the DOT to finish, and puff him again? takes like 20
[4:34:52] <TheTrueZyozz> It doesn't.
[4:34:53] <FeedbacK7777> it takes a bit over 60

[4:34:57] <+shadowace2400> Not really
[4:34:59] <%Aztec50> you can kill them for good?!?
[4:35:01] <couch_potato_Ed_Boy> CRAZY TALK ACTIVATE!
[4:35:02] <ShinobiPhoenix> @angriestpat I'll admit I am learning how to play RE2 better from watching you, but I need to improve my footsie game in Smash, and Foozies helps that.
[4:35:03] <DarkKnightGrave> Fried Cabbage
[4:35:03] <FeedbacK7777> you just need 60, pat
[4:35:08] <+Verd_254> you can just tap shoot it and use almost no ammo. Just takes longer.
[4:35:09] <%DirtyGaijin> Who grills a salad?
[4:35:10] <+shadowace2400> \you can just do it with bursts until they catch fire on htem
[4:35:10] <dekkitout> i guess he rounds up
[4:35:11] <TheTrueZyozz> Just hold until they fall, then tap a bit.
[4:35:13] <+DK_Rance> @Aztec50 you have to burn them
[4:35:13] <$Wafflum> So much easier to eradicate them with Claire if you've been hoarding Flame Rounds
[4:35:13] <%Corporate_Redeemer> X gonna give it to ya
[4:35:14] <+x24sonic> pat, it's only 60
[4:35:15] <%Pilzkun> @Aztec50 yup

[4:35:39] <thelilliestoflivers> pay you don't have to continuously burn them. You can just use a little bit to set them on fire until they drop, and then another little burst charger them black
[4:35:42] <CalderGaming> they kind of explode a little when they're totally burned up

[4:36:19] <+Yokuho> Too bad, you will
[4:36:22] <+Verd_254> you can just tap shoot it and wait for the dot to kill them

[4:37:12] <%TeraMercier> @LogothX In your first two or three runs I feel like they add some characterization and highlight the idea that these are normal people

[4:37:43] <TheTrueZyozz> Why is he doing item management? There's another item box.
[4:37:48] <+RageCasanova> ballsy no save
[4:37:48] <The_Blumper> does Leon kill Mister X?
[4:37:55] <taptapmuhgap> @willjar313 to get hold of someone and fuck they face?

[4:37:59] <%TeraMercier> Is there anybody that likes Jack more than X? I sure don't

[4:38:04] <%Kahnicus> @The_Blumper Yeah
[4:38:05] <CalderGaming> @theblumper in his scenarios, yes
[4:38:06] <ShinobiPhoenix> Woolie finished up, about to come INVADE WITH THE FOOZIES GANG
[4:38:06] <thelilliestoflivers> how much you want to bet he's still going to be wasting fuel like that on the next stream?
[4:38:09] <+RageCasanova> eh guess not
[4:38:20] <%cureneckbeard> Why does Pat and Wooolie stream at the same time
[4:38:29] <Gruhunchously> How many viruses does Umbrella develop anyway? How many viruses do you even need?
[4:38:29] <CalderGaming> throw the tape at mr x
[4:38:32] <%NME_Dom> poor alpha team
[4:38:38] <Cthulos> Stream tiddies
[4:38:39] <InugamiTheHound> pat has OCD and misses the attache case from RE4
[4:38:42] <+dougrayman> look at that muscle memory
[4:38:44] <%legendscar01> Hey guys is the secret room here?
[4:38:45] <majindusto> OSS
[4:38:45] <%TeraMercier> @thelilliestoflivers It's a tough enemy that he hates fighting, I doubt he'd care that much about using the flamethrower on any other enemy much anyway
[4:38:46] <%Aztec50> Hottest OSS
[4:38:47] <+Giantcanaloupe34> @cureneckbeard cause great minds think alike
[4:38:50] <Gruhunchously> Pat, get ur tiddies out
[4:38:51] <CalderGaming> just joined, how do you mute the signal modulator noises?
[4:38:53] <%willjar313> @taptapmuhgap Kinda sorta. Better put: to act as sort of a mobile obstacle to the player that complicates traversal through the area.
[4:38:53] <%DirtyGaijin> Oof
[4:38:54] <Shwepie> You can kill the plants with about 40 flame ammo if you let the fire on them do damage and then relight them. But it takes longer than just hosing them and you get some 1000 ammo for it.
[4:38:55] <+Blackgaver> this is a dumb puzzle
[4:38:57] <ShinobiPhoenix> pat streams for 5 million years, Woolie was on earlier teaching
[4:39:00] <vicviper_t301> Do we know why they call it the G virus? T was for Tyrant I assume but what's G then?
[4:39:02] <+runegod20> how good is the flamethrower against anything else really
[4:39:07] <%Kahnicus> @Gruhunchously Depends on how many ace upstart young people keep fucking up your virus monsters.
[4:39:11] <majindusto> EMAIL!
[4:39:12] <%king_wragles> @vicviper_t301 Gyrant?
[4:39:15] <CrabSlacks> slap that OSS
[4:39:17] <TheTrueZyozz> Oh, he noticed! Wish he noticed every other tip, though. Out of all the things I said, that was the least required thing for him to see.
[4:39:19] <%TeraMercier> The flamethrower is ass against zombies for the most part
[4:39:19] <%BioApple> Gherkin Birkin
[4:39:20] <germanmafia23> G is for Goo
[4:39:28] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Golgotha Virus, says google
[4:39:30] <+x24sonic> i genuinely do not know why they're still giving you blue herbs at this point in the game because you can only get poisoned by the g creatures
[4:39:32] <+Blackgaver> build up damage
[4:39:38] <%mostundesired> Phrasing.
[4:39:39] <%TeraMercier> Yeah, but that's what all the guns do idiot
[4:39:39] <taptapmuhgap> @willjar313 when I first played isolation I got backed into a corner and shotgunned the Xeno in futility. but when its hand came over my face it was bleeding. so I counted that a win
[4:39:41] <%TeraMercier> You just aim
[4:39:46] <thelilliestoflivers> I guess it makes sense to keep the okay wasting fuel on those, but you think he would want to conserve it because of his OCD which resource management generally speaking
[4:39:48] <InugamiTheHound> no laser hallway moment like in re4?
[4:39:48] <+Blackgaver> spray and pray
[4:39:49] <dekkitout> are we bringing back phrasing?
[4:39:49] <+runegod20> i feel like the only one that it would be decent against is the dogs since they seem a bit weaker but i think it would take too long
[4:39:51] <TheTrueZyozz> He doesn't have a lot of ammo.
[4:39:54] <%Kahnicus> @x24sonic Combined with red herb it does damage reduction
[4:39:56] <CalderGaming> @x24sonic because in remake RGB herb gives you damage reduction buff
[4:40:02] <%mostundesired> Phrasing never left in my heart.
[4:40:03] <+runegod20> and you don't fight dogs outside of the garage
[4:40:03] <+x24sonic> i did not know that
[4:40:08] <TheTrueZyozz> How is he gonna get through this?
[4:40:09] <%willjar313> @vicviper_t301 According to the wiki, the G stands for Golgotha. What's Golgotha? Fuck if I know.
[4:40:12] <%valriot> @angriestpat When he leans back into vulnerable state, just knife him in the back where you can also hit both his arms, they each count as a hit cos this game is dumb
[4:40:13] <taptapmuhgap> @willjar313 I have never beat mr. x though. though its been a long while since re2
[4:40:17] <+Blackgaver> bipbipbiiipbipbipbipbipbbip
[4:40:17] <+x24sonic> i thought the shield was just poison resistance that's actually cool as shit
[4:40:21] <+runegod20> but doesn't red and blue also give the damage thing
[4:40:23] <majindusto> Is the secret Lab room still in this version of RE2?
[4:40:24] <+brightman42> just finished a no item box run, was a lot more doable than i thought it'd be
[4:40:25] <+dickbuttwoman> Just hit the sort button pat!
[4:40:27] <%Kahnicus> @willjar313 Golgotha is the hill on which Jesus was crucified.
[4:40:30] <%TeraMercier> @thelilliestoflivers I've been in that mentality before, but it's not like there's a shortage of other ammo.
[4:40:30] <thelilliestoflivers> I believe Golgotha was a biblical City or something
[4:40:35] <davejackman> @willjar313 Golgotha is the hill that Jesus died on
[4:40:42] <+hillbillypowpow> This is as close as we'll get to Attache Case: Remastered
[4:40:43] <vicviper_t301> Yeah that definitely rings a bell
[4:40:43] <+runegod20> which some of the other modes do
[4:40:51] <%willjar313> @Kahnicus Now I know, and knowing is half the battle!
[4:40:51] <dekkitout> huh, the more you know 🌠
[4:40:53] <%pleasenameyourcharacter> witcher 3 merchant flashbacks...
[4:40:54] <%Corporate_Redeemer> Blue+Red herbs give you a damage resistance boost when combined. So you can take hits from Mr. X that'll leave you at Fine instead of at Caution
[4:41:05] <%texaporte> bring knives for G3's downed state!
[4:41:07] <%Kahnicus> @willjar313 GI JOOOEEEEE
[4:41:10] <+runegod20> a red/green and red/blue should be the exact same as a RGB mix
[4:41:11] <+Alig200> I find the auto-sort button for the item box is god tier
[4:41:17] <+Alig200> its so helpful to group shit together
[4:41:20] <%ThePuddingDead> u made rly good progress dude
[4:41:23] <majindusto> ONE MORE THING!
[4:41:23] <+dickbuttwoman> Whoa man, that's his 3 for an s+
[4:41:23] <TafferAA> forgot the virus LuL
[4:41:26] <ShinobiPhoenix> Golgatha is the hill Christ was crucifixed
[4:41:26] <TheTrueZyozz> If he gets through William and Mr. X easily--
[4:41:29] <TikanZK> did pat just say jew virus
[4:41:29] <Allthegoodnamesweretak3n> dont forget the g virus
[4:41:29] <+dickbuttwoman> can't save again
[4:41:30] <Gruhunchously> You can't forget the G-Virus
[4:41:30] <CalderGaming> That Was Easy
[4:41:31] <+hillbillypowpow> What did I come here for?
[4:41:32] <person181> oops
[4:41:34] <+Blackgaver> the jesus virus
[4:41:35] <%Corporate_Redeemer> RACCOON
[4:41:35] <+runegod20> the RGB mix takes up less room but you can use one without doing the other
[4:41:36] <%BioApple> "Leon you made it! You got the G-Virus right?" "uhhhhh"
[4:41:36] <+hillbillypowpow> OH YEAH THE VIRUS
[4:41:36] <vicviper_t301> All employees proceed to the platform
[4:41:37] <+DukeMoose> Ooopsi do
[4:41:38] <%stolando_florida> I think you can only get S in standard. I could be wrong
[4:41:41] <dekkitout> youll never get my precious g virus
[4:41:42] <Acidshocker> Did het put the mag ammo back?
[4:41:45] <%cureneckbeard> G-virus = ginger virus
[4:41:52] <%nademonkey1100> no
[4:41:54] <+dickbuttwoman> I don't believe the cutscenes take timer
[4:41:56] <+x24sonic> i don't think cutscenes count to timer
[4:41:58] <%WheatlyXT> Just the extra mag ammo
[4:41:58] <+Alig200> @stolando_florida nah, you can get S+ in standard too
[4:42:00] <+brightman42> good to know
[4:42:03] <TheTrueZyozz> I believe they do.
[4:42:04] <%Corporate_Redeemer> I think they might
[4:42:04] <Guardiansaiyan> Wish Annette had the classic model
[4:42:06] <Allthegoodnamesweretak3n> thot
[4:42:07] <%stolando_florida> Interdasting
[4:42:10] <Ir_ramble> its Paige!!!
[4:42:11] <dekkitout> leave birkin to me!
[4:42:11] <+nathandiel> No
[4:42:12] <CalderGaming> doesn't she know flame rounds work better than acid on this stage Kappa
[4:42:16] <%pleasenameyourcharacter> "But the world refused to change..."
[4:42:20] <+dougrayman> that eye though
[4:42:20] <majindusto> NOPE
[4:42:21] <faegbeard> as evil as Umbrella is, having only ten minutes before everything blows up upon a virus being removed without authorization is pretty strong
[4:42:22] <waifoong98> No cutscene doesn't count
[4:42:24] <%ThePuddingDead> so were those acid rounds?
[4:42:26] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> stump stump stump
[4:42:29] <InugamiTheHound> i resident evil raccoon city leon kills Mr.X but ada dies and they have kiss
[4:42:34] <JDRK> LUL
[4:42:35] <JJMR322> in stage 5 you can see his face
[4:42:35] <natebud> Still wearing those pants though william?
[4:42:36] <Guardiansaiyan> @faegbeard I thought it would be 5 minutes
[4:42:37] <Heyestus> How come nobody gets her little handheld grenade launcher @AngriestPat
[4:42:38] <Hellarussian> GOTEM
[4:42:39] <%TeraMercier> And Leon just walks over to it assuming it's actually dead
[4:42:40] <%Corporate_Redeemer> No those were Aqua Rounds
[4:42:40] <+DukeMoose> i want her flare gun grenade launcher
[4:42:41] <vicviper_t301> I thought it was freeze maybe and she's got tricks Claire doesn't
[4:42:42] <Naho_Saenoki> @ThePuddingDead Yes.
[4:42:44] <Guardiansaiyan> We can still SAVE THE CITY
[4:42:44] <majindusto> No You
[4:42:45] <+Nomicro4u> NO BUT IT WASN'T ME ME
[4:42:47] <+hillbillypowpow> YOU made the virus!
[4:42:48] <+AXL808> YO'RE wearing the lab coat!
[4:42:49] <LtThunderbolt> stupid bitch
[4:42:49] <+dickbuttwoman> Ice rounds
[4:42:51] <%ThePuddingDead> what the fuck was your plan bitch!?
[4:42:54] <%texaporte> spray birkin with water, instakill
[4:42:54] <+dickbuttwoman> From africa
[4:42:55] <+AXL808> you're
[4:42:56] <Guardiansaiyan> The CITY can be SAVED
[4:42:59] <Gruhunchously> F L A S H B A C K
[4:43:01] <+brightman42> is he using classic soundtrack with the costumes too?
[4:43:02] <%Docblargle> Excuse me Pat, this doesn't look like Kingdom Hearts 3 to me
[4:43:02] <%Keyd00d> BUT I FELT BAD ABOUT IT
[4:43:05] <CalderGaming> but they checked his pulse tho
[4:43:07] <%BioApple> We made the super zombie virus but we never meant for there to be super zombies HERE
[4:43:07] <Valdorick> We never meant for the zombie super soldiers to be used as zombie super soldiers!
[4:43:08] <%Corporate_Redeemer> We never meant for our ultimate BIOWEAPON to be so dangerous
[4:43:08] <%NWR_James> why did umbrella leave him with the vial
[4:43:09] <Guardiansaiyan> @brightman42 yes
[4:43:11] <natebud> I just wanted to run my MURDER ORPHANAGE in peace!
[4:43:11] <TheTrueZyozz> @Heyestus, it's a flare gun that shoots acid shells.
[4:43:13] <%TeraMercier> Annette mostly has conversations with herself that other people interrupt
[4:43:14] <%willjar313> Why does the syringe look like that?
[4:43:14] <thatd00doverthere> WHAT WAS HIS PLAN
[4:43:14] <+dickbuttwoman> "I'm going to make the worst possible decision"
[4:43:15] <%Starlight_Gamer> how many bullets did william take?
[4:43:16] <+Nomicro4u> So if he injected himself after he was shot, why didn't HUNK's squad realize he wasn't dead?
[4:43:19] <%korth367> how is he alive after all those bullets
[4:43:20] <%legendscar01> That doesn't look like William
[4:43:20] <mastermidget23> just saw the anime league of legends and and I want to stab someone.
[4:43:21] <poweredscoot> I wasn't planning for the rats to get into the virus. Everything else was fine.
[4:43:21] <%cureneckbeard> We never meant our zombie virus to turn people into zombies
[4:43:22] <Desertfishing> that's why the transformation is on his right side
[4:43:26] <%Kahnicus> So.... I'm calling bullshit on Birkin still being alive to inject himself. And why would the USS guys leave him an injector?
[4:43:27] <The_Blumper> BUT THAT SWEET REVENGE
[4:43:29] <TheTrueZyozz> Closest thing to getting it is in the models.
[4:43:29] <Gruhunchously> Oops
[4:43:32] <silvcrest> He was already dying
[4:43:32] <+brightman42> it's perfect
[4:43:33] <LtThunderbolt> CRUSH
[4:43:34] <+oOZtkOo> i mean he was gonna die if he didnt
[4:43:35] <+Nomicro4u> He had no pulse after they put rounds into him
[4:43:35] <Beef_Broganoff> To be fair, knowing he won't get to enjoy it is like the purest form of spite
[4:43:35] <Renuarb> I mean Pat... he was dying
[4:43:36] <RiverBirch> Question for chat
[4:43:36] <%TeraMercier> Yeah, but he got to have funu using his work
[4:43:36] <dekkitout> so who shot him
[4:43:37] <%Corporate_Redeemer> BUT DEM EYES
[4:43:37] <reonome> BYE ANNETTE
[4:43:39] <ObsidianDragon86> Cronch
[4:43:39] <%TheMilhouseExperience> We made the virus, but not to use. Just to use with discretion.
[4:43:40] <%Big_Dream> i didnt agree to make that bio weapon they hired me to make
[4:43:40] <ShinobiPhoenix> I would IMMEDIATELY turn off the stream if Pat switched to Kingdom Hearts III
[4:43:40] <%salty_syd913> crunch
[4:43:40] <thelonechris> "I'm gonna turn myself into a monster because fuck you guys!"
[4:43:40] <couch_potato_Ed_Boy> @mastermidget23 What now?
[4:43:41] <RiverBirch> What causes Him to even inject himself?
[4:43:41] <%Ell1ot> I'm back Pat!
[4:43:42] <$SleepyMaribo> DIVORCE CLAW!!!
[4:43:42] <shaneok64> DEAD
[4:43:43] <taptapmuhgap> dead
[4:43:43] <Bouldus> you burnt the roast Kappa
[4:43:44] <RiverBirch> Who shot Berkin?
[4:43:46] <romanticzomedy> tfw william begs you to help him in your first boss fight with him in this game (:
[4:43:47] <%Ahack13> Yeah, but he was already dieing when he became a goo monster. Unlike every other RE villian that does it.
[4:43:47] <arcaderabbit48> To be fair, he was dying at thew time. So he wasnt gonna see his vengeance play out either way
[4:43:47] <%WheatlyXT> Hype
[4:43:48] <%Corporate_Redeemer> It was worth it for the EYEBALLS
[4:43:48] <%korth367> the hell
[4:43:50] <IminyourBase> that's the first time in months burkin has touched his wife
[4:43:51] <CalderGaming> SYMMETRY ACHIEVED
[4:43:51] <person181> big goo
[4:43:51] <Desertfishing> the end of matrimony
[4:43:53] <Gruhunchously> How is she still alive?
[4:43:54] <Guardiansaiyan> @Kahnicus its like people accidently falling on dicks a lot...he 'accidentally' fell on the injector
[4:43:55] <Allthegoodnamesweretak3n> Don't think i wont inject myself with this horrible virus that i dont want anyone to take... ill do it
[4:43:57] <majindusto> GORO MODE
[4:44:03] <%cureneckbeard> F
[4:44:04] <%texaporte> i definitely heard a spine break, that's bullshit she still stand
[4:44:04] <ScreamingMeat> And now there is no evidence of Birken left
[4:44:04] <%TeraMercier> @Kahnicus It was maybe already in an injector, and leon got shot in this game too, so whatever
[4:44:08] <dekkitout> hey look, hes in his cool curse mark stage 3 form Kappa
[4:44:13] <Guardiansaiyan> Classic boss fight music
[4:44:13] <+dougrayman> BS, i heard her body crack, how is she able to stand?
[4:44:16] <+hillbillypowpow> There was a definite crunch
[4:44:17] <%ThePuddingDead> I thought he said "Leon is Here!"
[4:44:17] <%Corporate_Redeemer> When Annette told Berkin to choke her she didn't mean it like THAT
[4:44:18] <%joylent_blue> RiverBirch Hunk and his squad were sent to get the virus from Birkin, and Birkin resisted, they shot him
[4:44:18] <BakedPretzels> leon is so fucking cool
[4:44:21] <+blondie_ow> THE MUSIC <3
[4:44:21] <+Yokuho> You can still see william's face on his chest
[4:44:22] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> 🎺
[4:44:22] <romanticzomedy> them ribs busted, y'all
[4:44:24] <CalderGaming> yeah classic soundtrack
[4:44:25] <+DK_Rance> @RiverBirch hunk and crew when they showed up to take the virus from him
[4:44:25] <%TeraMercier> This design is so fucking radical
[4:44:26] <%willjar313> Not only does Birkin not get to enjoy his revenge, but he also DRASTICALLY exacerbates the T-Virus out break in Raccoon City, thus putting his own daughter in danger.
[4:44:29] <+dickbuttwoman> One magnum in each eye, pat
[4:44:29] <%pleasenameyourcharacter> "THIS IS THE POLICE!"
[4:44:29] <+hillbillypowpow> Burkin in Smash when?
[4:44:30] <Zombrocom> Theres no birkin left
[4:44:30] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@RageCasanova) (warning)
[4:44:31] <+AXL808> i forget is G -virus an evolution of T or separate?
[4:44:31] <%topendbuzz> oof
[4:44:31] <+nathandiel> Paige just killed Leon
[4:44:34] <InugamiTheHound> he looks like a necromorph from dead space now
[4:44:36] <Bouldus> moobot down
[4:44:42] <Bouldus> down moobot, bad bot
[4:44:43] <natebud> So much for the no heal run
[4:44:44] <romanticzomedy> or the necromorphs looked like HIM
[4:44:44] <%TeraMercier> @willjar313 They both stopped caring about their daughter a long time ago
[4:44:46] <Valdorick> I really love the difference between Leon and Claire, with Claire going "Leave Birkin to me!" and Leon going "What the fuck are you doing ya crazy lady!?"
[4:44:46] <Beef_Broganoff> I honestly don't know how much Birkin cares about his daughter
[4:44:46] <%ThePuddingDead> Eeerngh
[4:44:49] <RantingRavager> DODGE ROLL
[4:44:50] <%Corporate_Redeemer> OLE' RELIABLS
[4:44:54] <%cureneckbeard> But what if you need it later
[4:44:55] <JetpackMcQuack> such reliable
[4:44:56] <TheTrueZyozz> He's not making it through this easily.
[4:44:57] <majindusto> FUCK YOUR EYES!
[4:44:57] <Mage_Neb> dadSlark
[4:44:57] <+Blackgaver> SPLAT
[4:44:58] <+dickbuttwoman> Shotgun is not reliable for arm eye
[4:44:59] <42nfl19> This is weird, in Leon's run Anette sends Leon down to fight. For Claire she sends her own self down.
[4:44:59] <dekkitout> drop your shield
[4:45:00] <Beef_Broganoff> We at least know Annette cares like the bare minimum
[4:45:00] <+RageCasanova> best boss music in all video games
[4:45:01] <romanticzomedy> Sherry was the Uh Oh baby
[4:45:01] <%Tearonex> yup
[4:45:03] <DracaenaLeaf> because your aim sucks
[4:45:03] <%Kahnicus> @TeraMercier I'm more thinking they should've rifled his pockets as part of their job, but I suppose the plot hinges on failing upward.
[4:45:05] <%3xgilly> BIG SUCC
[4:45:05] <+Yokuho> BEAT YOU UPP
[4:45:05] <ScreamingMeat> Fuck off that it
[4:45:06] <Jammho> uh
[4:45:09] <Darlington_the_Deceiver> DIG UP
[4:45:09] <%willjar313> William Birkin might actually be a worse father than Goku.
[4:45:10] <%TeraMercier> I bet Sherry happened on fucking accident
[4:45:12] <ScreamingMeat> *hit
[4:45:12] <%BioApple> leave jiren to claire
[4:45:12] <thatd00doverthere> eeswww
[4:45:15] <%Corporate_Redeemer> POP POP
[4:45:18] <ObsidianDragon86> GRANT US EYES
[4:45:20] <+Nomicro4u> yeah rub your face in his eyes
[4:45:22] <CrabSlacks> just tank the hits!
[4:45:23] <TheTrueZyozz> Nope. Don't need the magnum for him.
[4:45:24] <%topendbuzz> WHY EYES THO
[4:45:25] <TrashCorner> i actually miss actions prompts for dodge
[4:45:25] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Shoot the big glowing bits for maximum damage
[4:45:26] <%TeraMercier> @Kahnicus Yeah, they cap him and then just fuck off without confirming the kill
[4:45:26] <+dickbuttwoman> I don't think it's possible to one phase it
[4:45:29] <+runegod20> i like how it gets an actual monster face
[4:45:30] <Valdorick> Ultra Instinct Claire

[4:45:37] <CalderGaming> has he been saving the magnum for the whole game or did he just get a ton of ammo
[4:45:40] <%pleasenameyourcharacter> i wonder how fucking god tier of a cop Leon would've been if the zombie outbreak never happened and he just suplexed street criminals...
[4:45:45] <%ThePuddingDead> Hrrrrngh!
[4:45:46] <TafferAA> lol controller aiming
[4:45:47] <majindusto> Such a lust for Eyes
[4:45:49] <+Nomicro4u> How many people in the world have Eye fetish?
[4:45:50] <%General_Terro> i demand more eyes
[4:45:53] <Valdorick> !Rank at risk!
[4:45:55] <L33TLink> That defense up is doing some work!
[4:45:57] <PoketVision22> you can do it Pat!!
[4:45:57] <dekkitout> velstadt flashbacks intensify
[4:45:59] <%TeraMercier> Caldergaming, there's not much point using magnum on most other enemies
[4:46:01] <+dickbuttwoman> Arm eye should be mugnum
[4:46:05] <+AXL808> i want world of light music playing in the background
[4:46:05] <TheTrueZyozz> @CalderGaming, he won't have enough for Mr. X.
[4:46:05] <+x24sonic> NICE JUKE
[4:46:05] <%Corporate_Redeemer> S Rank at risk!!!!
[4:46:06] <+Yokuho> DO COMBO PAT

[4:46:21] <+x24sonic> god you are KILLING it
[4:46:27] <Gruhunchously> @pleasenameyourcharacter he would be like Kiryu except on the police's side.
[4:46:27] <+brightman42> right next to a spray, will he see it?
[4:46:27] <Beef_Broganoff> If the outbreak never happened Leon would've just been like, a Final Fight cop
[4:46:30] <thebakaliyen> did pat intetionally crazy talk?
[4:46:33] <%TeraMercier> @ScreamingMeat The true beauty of the tofu mode is to see the hitbox

[4:46:51] <zoopbooploop> FIRST TRY
[4:46:52] <mastermidget23> @teramercier What's weird is they DID confirm the kill by checkin his pulse. I guess who ever checked it was just shit at it.
[4:46:52] <%bigdogsteve54> IF YOU WANT A BETTER TIME: instantly reload the same save after you die! Hitting continue or load game on the death screen keeps your wasted time but reloading it sets it back
[4:46:52] <+RageCasanova> hype
[4:46:52] <%pleasenameyourcharacter> @gruhunchously oh, man, that's too accurate...

[4:47:08] <+x24sonic> holy shit you used crazy talk to your advantage
[4:47:08] <Valdorick> Bregenwerth are losers who want eyes on the inside, the only true form of eyes is eyes on the outside. Outside Eyes, all the time.
[4:47:09] <thebakaliyen> he almost reversed it
[4:47:10] <+brightman42> weaponized stand go
[4:47:12] <+thewaifoo> if only he had flamethrower
[4:47:13] <natebud> I can believe he's finally dead

[4:47:21] <TheTrueZyozz> Seriously using a magnum bullet on a three burst kill.
[4:47:21] <sackerkappa> He talks Crazy Talk...
[4:47:25] <%Tearonex> crazy goddamn talk
[4:47:29] <%TeraMercier> @mastermidget23 They did? That's some straight up plot hole bullshit. You don't get into these fucking spec ops units without being able to check a fucking pulse
[4:47:29] <%pleasenameyourcharacter> @beef_broganoff also weirdly on point
[4:47:33] <Desertfishing> but the future refused to change
[4:47:38] <ScreamingMeat> Every time I kill a boss in this game my RE4 instincts tell me to pick up the item he drops, but there is no item
[4:47:38] <majindusto> CRAZY TALK will not Save You
[4:47:47] <InkyDraconian> Stab his not dead body
[4:47:48] <%RageKingDomo> they should add a WEsker part as DLC
[4:47:51] <Mangahero18> Why is there so much loose ammunition in this STERILE LABORATORY?
[4:47:51] <%3xgilly> thatt THICCCCCCCCCCCC ammo
[4:47:53] <%CubicPhantom> and with him dies the secret of why kids love cinnamon toast crunch - only he had eyes to see it
[4:47:53] <Beef_Broganoff> I would believe Final Fight and RE share the same universe
[4:47:56] <thatd00doverthere> looks like that'll be the last time we see THAT guy amiright fellas
[4:48:04] <Beef_Broganoff> An outbreak in Metro City would be some REAL bad shit
[4:48:05] <%Kahnicus> @Valdorick I like where this eye thing is going.
[4:48:11] <TafferAA> i think you're good pat
[4:48:11] <%cureneckbeard> Who just leaves a shitload of various bullets around a quarantine zone
[4:48:15] <%TeraMercier> During this timeframe, hasn't Wesker had to get the fuck out of dodge already?
[4:48:16] <Allthegoodnamesweretak3n> Is resident evil nemesis not on pc?
[4:48:20] <vicviper_t301> Dude the computer voice even said 'threat neutralized'
[4:48:21] <+mgs3ladderscene> Just think of Nemesis if they do re3
[4:48:25] <+brightman42> bullet fairy
[4:48:27] <arcaderabbit48> @RageKingDomo Okay but legit question, what the hell was Wesker doing during RE2 other than not being dead?
[4:48:28] <CalderGaming> where is wesker at this point in time? chilling in a lab somewhere out of the city?
[4:48:30] <Beef_Broganoff> Though then again, everyone would just Joe Baker their way through it
[4:48:32] <+ahdurian> i love when they're deader
[4:48:33] <mastermidget23> @teramercier They sure did! Finger to neck and everything. it's real weird.
[4:48:37] <+8framelag> this isn't even my final form!
[4:48:41] <TheTrueZyozz> @thatd00doverthere, it is. He's not playing the 2nd scenario.
[4:48:41] <Lord_Atreides> Oh hey everyone - had a day off from the grocery mines so I can join you for the strem
[4:48:43] <%RageKingDomo> @arcaderabbit48 Exaccctlyyy my poiny
[4:48:44] <Naho_Saenoki> @Beef_Broganoff I'm pretty sure Cody could take on the whole outbreak, Joe Baker style.
[4:48:48] <ScreamingMeat> @AngriestPat what do you think of Metro Exodus coming out in a couple weeks?
[4:48:50] <%Ell1ot> but where's mr x?
[4:48:52] <%ThePuddingDead> So what was Claire's final boss btw? I missed when he beat Claire A
[4:48:52] <%BrazenMask> Theres no way he's become some kind of...sluudge vestibule
[4:48:55] <%TeraMercier> @cureneckbeard The same police chief that justifies hiding ammo in his Museum police station by mentioning a commie invasion
[4:48:58] <InugamiTheHound> remember Irvine from RE5 becoming that huge lake whale monster in minutes
[4:49:00] <%RageKingDomo> even if hes just sitting at a desk gimme some WEsker
[4:49:01] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> If Paige is asleep, whisper "Stop eating McDonalds." to her. Maybe her subconscious will remember
[4:49:02] <arcaderabbit48> Is Wesker just in a DBZ-style healing tank right now, floating in a combination of Las Plagas and TG Juice?
[4:49:05] <+oOZtkOo> I wish Joe Baker would show up and suplex Mr. X
[4:49:07] <Run44forrest> HES STILL STREAMING?
[4:49:13] <+8framelag> Irvine weskermod PogChamp
[4:49:14] <zettig> Is that thing that attacks the train supposed to be Birkin or is it a different G-creature?
[4:49:15] <%MattDemers> apatBig troyHey
[4:49:15] <Valdorick> Alright, alright, hear me out, okay, what if meet in the middle, and have an eye, right, and then, inside that eye, it grows eyes, but also, on the outside of the eye, it grows EVEN MORE EYES! And then THOSE eyes do the same thing! I'll call it, the Eye-Cell!
[4:49:17] <TafferAA> more hand grenades
[4:49:19] <majindusto> G Virus refuses to Die.
[4:49:20] <+CrookedSpiral> gdqSanic gdqSanic gdqSanic
[4:49:23] <thatd00doverthere> I would very much like Wesker Jaguar dashing through this game
[4:49:24] <Lord_Atreides> Much love @angriestpat - you’re a madman for still streaming this strong :O
[4:49:26] <Naho_Saenoki> @zettig It's Birkin.
[4:49:27] <%BioApple> the I-Virus
[4:49:33] <AntChodeny> just ditch the flamethrower. It's easy to bypass the planet zombies.
[4:49:33] <%Starlight_Gamer> what is with the different samurai edges?
[4:49:34] <%Ell1ot> is Paige still here?
[4:49:35] <ShinobiPhoenix> Final Fight is already Street Fighter Universe and I don't think Bison is allowing Umbrella to do anything that gets his way, and Wesker would be constantly trying to undermine Shadowloo
[4:49:35] <CalderGaming> @zettig that is birkin, yes
[4:49:36] <+Nomicro4u> ouch
[4:49:36] <%Keyd00d> X rank PogChamp
[4:49:37] <+brightman42> plenty of time
[4:49:40] <person181> spoilers pat
[4:49:41] <%Plague_Nurse> Really?
[4:49:42] <zettig> thanks
[4:49:42] <Gruhunchously> Harsh
[4:49:44] <+AXL808> Bye, Ada
[4:49:44] <%Kahnicus> Stumble the Tyrant! @AngriestPat
[4:49:46] <natebud> I can't believe Ada's finally dead
[4:49:48] <arcaderabbit48> Birkin has more eyes on the inside than the av erage Bloddborne boss
[4:49:48] <+oOZtkOo> do you unlock anything with better ranks?
[4:49:49] <daisymaisy02> Except not really tho right?
[4:49:49] <%TeraMercier> I could see someone making the argument that USS operative's gloves are thick, but the cutscene where he's alive hes awake and everything, he doesn't even like wake up from a coma
[4:49:52] <+brightman42> you got less than 10
[4:49:53] <majindusto> I...NEED...MORE....EYES!
[4:49:54] <vicviper_t301> I was hoping this game would actually explain how Ada survives the fall but eh
[4:49:58] <Desertfishing> IT WORKED!
[4:49:58] <%Kahnicus> Annette's like BITCH you get on MY cycle
[4:50:01] <InugamiTheHound> so ada does die and other versions of her are a plane made by wesker?
[4:50:05] <Gruhunchously> Wait, how can Ada be dead if she's in RE6?
[4:50:09] <%TeraMercier> I assume Ada just used her grapple gun from RE4
[4:50:10] <%Corporate_Redeemer> Ada is TOTALLY dead
[4:50:16] <CalderGaming> ada probably uses grapple gun that she didn't show anyone the whole game
[4:50:16] <+oOZtkOo> PogChamp WOW
[4:50:16] <%ThePuddingDead> christ
[4:50:18] <+blondie_ow> S plus rank. Not just S rank.
[4:50:20] <%lessclams> s+
[4:50:21] <+dickbuttwoman> S+ does something too, right?
[4:50:21] <Emzero> you mean S / S+
[4:50:22] <+runegod20> aren't the only times you see the plants the times where they're getting up from the ground so you can just walk pass them
[4:50:23] <arcaderabbit48> @vicviper_t301 It makes it even more unlcear! She plummets into an abyss of darkness, but fuck us I guess!
[4:50:23] <+Yokuho> Actually...
[4:50:24] <JDRK> those are S and S+ not A and S
[4:50:27] <%Plague_Nurse> oh damn
[4:50:28] <%bendatron> how do you get the classic costumes
[4:50:32] <%BioApple> ooh I should look up those raccoon locations
[4:50:33] <Tevvy> yeah its actually even harder than that. its S and S+
[4:50:38] <%TeraMercier> Ada shows up in Re4 too after this
[4:50:38] <+runegod20> do you still need to reload the guns?
[4:50:38] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> DLC, or special edition
[4:50:39] <germanmafia23> just beat one scenario for costumes
[4:50:40] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@Puppet88) (warning)
[4:50:40] <Desertfishing> so pat when you gonna get that rocket launcher
[4:50:40] <Beef_Broganoff> rest in peace Ada, too bad she couldn't have stuck around in the series longer
[4:50:42] <%GeneralSCPatton> A doesn't unlock shit.
[4:50:43] <%Corporate_Redeemer> There's an Infinite MP5, too
[4:50:43] <+oOZtkOo> even an infinite handgun feels broken
[4:50:44] <Rellim80> S+, not S
[4:50:46] <+Alig200> S+ on Hardcore for Leon gives Infinite Rockets, S+ on Hardcore for Claire gives Infinite Minigun.
[4:50:47] <%Aztec50> infinite rocket launcher PogChamp
[4:50:47] <Run44forrest> shouldnt leon shoot ada on sight in Re4
[4:50:48] <+8framelag> would be hilarious if X takes rockets like a boss
[4:50:48] <Megapikman132> How does one even get S+?
[4:50:51] <%Kahnicus> @bendatron Think it's just beat first run, I got em
[4:50:53] <+Apokiliptickaos> atpGasm atpGasm atpGasm
[4:50:54] <TheTrueZyozz> Hopefully, in the next few days, I'll be able to get that "S" rank on hardcore.
[4:50:56] <dekkitout> but wait- eyes on the outside, right, but what about- the inside; like, writhing with eyes too
[4:50:58] <+Yokuho> You get the rocket launcher if you beat LEON on HARDCORE with S+, that means you can only save 3 times and have to beat the timer
[4:50:59] <arcaderabbit48> Is Ada a clone?
[4:50:59] <+Puppet88> all employees proceed to the bottom platform!
[4:51:01] <%WackyGear> you missed an item
[4:51:02] <Slasher9485> Does your rank suffer based on how much you save?
[4:51:06] <%pleasenameyourcharacter> @run44forrest he tried and failed
[4:51:06] <+x24sonic> so now the rank is basically guaranteed bc you're limited to 10 minutes now
[4:51:06] <+ahdurian> what happened to Big Chungus?
[4:51:07] <Naho_Saenoki> @Megapikman132 Same as S, except you have to save 3 or fewer times.
[4:51:08] <Beef_Broganoff> I can't imagine doing a sub 2 hour run on Hardcore
[4:51:11] <+Yokuho> Claire gets a minigun
[4:51:11] <%TeraMercier> @arcaderabbit48 I think in Re6 yes
[4:51:11] <Beef_Broganoff> I am just not that good
[4:51:13] <TheTrueZyozz> I want the achievements first, though.
[4:51:15] <%Corporate_Redeemer> @angriestpat Don't forget the Infinite MP5
[4:51:15] <%Plague_Nurse> Does saving a lot hurt your grade?
[4:51:15] <luckycloud91> Man this music is great
[4:51:16] <+runegod20> if you don't have to reload, the rocket launcher would be better if it means no start up time
[4:51:17] <Valdorick> When I play games, every rank is S rank! If that S stands for shit...….
[4:51:31] <+oOZtkOo> can you use the infinite handgun on subsequent playthroughs to help get a better rank?
[4:51:31] <Highwang> are you using the old soundtrack?
[4:51:33] <Guardiansaiyan> The MUSIC
[4:51:36] <%ThePuddingDead> that music :3
[4:51:38] <Guardiansaiyan> @Highwang yes
[4:51:39] <ScreamingMeat> X GONNA GIVE IT TO YA!!!
[4:51:39] <%CubicPhantom> you're not yourself zombie, have a flash grenade
[4:51:40] <CalderGaming> yup, old st
[4:51:42] <+Blackgaver> Kreygasm
[4:51:43] <+oOZtkOo> or would it disqualify you
[4:51:43] <Highwang> Excellent
[4:51:44] <%GeneralSCPatton> @megapikman132 I believe it's a speedrun with no deaths, at most 3 saves, and none of the infinite weapons used.
[4:51:48] <+dickbuttwoman> @oOZtkOo You can't get the S+ rank with the infinite stuff
[4:51:48] <+Maids4lyfe> classic escape theme
[4:51:49] <vicviper_t301> Aim for S, settle for A, that's my motto
[4:51:49] <arcaderabbit48> @TeraMercier But that's a different Ada, right? The Real Ada is also there? I havent actually seen RE6 in any capacity, I'm mostly just taking a stab at the dark as to how she survives this game
[4:51:50] <+Alig200> @oOZtkOo yes, but not for S+
[4:51:51] <Megapikman132> Thanks all.
[4:51:52] <TheTrueZyozz> Flash grenade to get by him faster.
[4:51:53] <SeventyForce> Baiiiiiiiii
[4:51:53] <%Kahnicus> I always think of Arrested Development... MISTER X
[4:51:54] <+brightman42> music still holds up, so good
[4:51:54] <+oOZtkOo> dammit
[4:51:54] <%CubicPhantom> and you're the PUNCHline kennedy
[4:51:54] <+Apokiliptickaos> atpCap atpSpiner
[4:51:58] <Naho_Saenoki> @oOZtkOo Infinite weapons besides the knife prevent you from getting S+.
[4:52:00] <+Blackgaver> quick get aboard the GALAXY CINQ MILLE
[4:52:01] <%Docblargle> X gonna give it to ya
[4:52:01] <+critfumble_> mister shakedown!
[4:52:03] <LtThunderbolt> Ah! is this a fucking meme!
[4:52:14] <+blondie_ow> I wish the classic music replaced the self destruct voice as well.
[4:52:15] <+Darastrix> Take, this broken knife, and learned to stab again, learn to live your life..
[4:52:15] <scrumbotime> the music on the ladder almost sounded like the start of the spiderman pizza music
[4:52:22] <arcaderabbit48> Honestly this game needs an ADA and Wesker DLC just to explain how the hell 4 actually happened
[4:52:22] <%TeraMercier> Idunno man, it's probably just a grapple hook justification. Never actually beat re6
[4:52:24] <%Niney_Who> Your ass has clapped for the last time, LEON
[4:52:25] <+Yokuho> @AngriestPat If you never shoot his hat he wears it in the cutscenes
[4:52:25] <Beef_Broganoff> @arcaderabbit48 oh my god I forgot about Fake Ada.
[4:52:25] <%ThePuddingDead> landed on his car keys
[4:52:26] <mastermidget23> @naho_saenoki the knife doesn't prevent it?
[4:52:27] <+Nomicro4u> Hold up the X with your arms everytime Mr. X does something cool
[4:52:28] <natebud> The run away music from Re2 is top tier
[4:52:31] <ScreamingMeat> I love how his gross arm stays on fire
[4:52:34] <Naho_Saenoki> @mastermidget23 Correct.
[4:52:34] <+psithen> can you even "kill" him in the remake?
[4:52:39] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> So why does only now his arm get Tyrant-y
[4:52:43] <Gruhunchously> Gotta go FAST
[4:52:43] <TafferAA> laying on that flamethrower has to be painful
[4:52:51] <%legendscar01> SONIC
[4:52:51] <%TeraMercier> @psithen I'm told he'll just take a knee for a few seconds
[4:52:53] <CalderGaming> @Sphincter_Spelunker he finally takes enough damage
[4:52:53] <Highwang> >4 Samurai Edge models
[4:52:55] <Highwang> dude what
[4:52:55] <Firesparks> is leon or chris resident evil's poster boy?
[4:52:56] <thatd00doverthere> somebody call platinum and get them to make a Wesker character action game
[4:52:56] <majindusto> The Self Destruct Sequence has Been Activated...This Sequence May Not Be Aborted!
[4:52:56] <vicviper_t301> It's some limiter thing under his coat
[4:52:57] <+Blackgaver> but first..... INVENTORY
[4:52:58] <SchroedingersFerret> X gon something something something
[4:52:58] <InugamiTheHound> in resident evil outbreak file 2. Tyrant goes out of control and kills the person with the remote. Later on Nyx absorbs Tyrant in the final boss fight
[4:53:00] <%pleasenameyourcharacter> Joestar bloodline technique... GOOO!
[4:53:00] <%GeneralSCPatton> That DOES sound kind of like pizza time!
[4:53:02] <%Kahnicus> not sure how a 10 foot fall stops Tyrant but alright
[4:53:03] <TheTrueZyozz> Item boxes and inventory add to time.
[4:53:07] <Beef_Broganoff> Yeah, he takes a knee for maybe 30
[4:53:08] <+dickbuttwoman> Wooo glad he didn't save
[4:53:09] <TheTrueZyozz> adds*
[4:53:10] <%sirmackslot> If only the costume returned his fish lips
[4:53:10] <%TeraMercier> @thatd00doverthere Basically Re5 mercenaries
[4:53:11] <Lord_Atreides> X be praised all praise x
[4:53:12] <vicviper_t301> The fire burns it away and he gets tyrant claw
[4:53:12] <+runegod20> whenever i see the stock to the flamethrower, i keep thinking it's a MP40 or something
[4:53:13] <+Bakin1989> Woah, how many times have you beaten this?
[4:53:13] <waifoong98> @Highwang Chris Jill Albert and INFINITE
[4:53:14] <ScreamingMeat> @psithen No, he just takes a knee for a few seconds before continuing the chase
[4:53:14] <%ThePuddingDead> gl
[4:53:15] <+AXL808> Pat makes sure to grab all his crack before leaving
[4:53:17] <Beef_Broganoff> Long enough to run your ass in the other direction
[4:53:22] <+psithen> so no secret rewards for downing him then
[4:53:25] <thatd00doverthere> yeah but a whole game like that
[4:53:26] <Beef_Broganoff> Nope
[4:53:26] <%TeraMercier> Runegod, totally it gets me too
[4:53:28] <+Yokuho> It autosaves when you get to the lift
[4:53:32] <Gruhunchously> Jesus
[4:53:34] <%Piemen99> 5TH?
[4:53:37] <+dickbuttwoman> He might get S+, so long as he didn't use any of the infitnite stuff
[4:53:38] <Highwang> oh look a battle arena
[4:53:38] <+psithen> that's kinda cool, makes him more threatening really
[4:53:39] <+x24sonic> jesus christ
[4:53:39] <arcaderabbit48> @psithen Nope. Sadly this is not a Nemesis situation
[4:53:42] <%Niney_Who> ONE SHALL CLAP
[4:53:43] <+oOZtkOo> you really like re2 huh?
[4:53:44] <%Niney_Who> ONE SHALL FALL
[4:53:46] <%CubicPhantom> KNOCK KNOCK, open up the door it's REAL
[4:53:46] <%salty_syd913> the biggest boy
[4:53:46] <natebud> Dat boi
[4:53:48] <%Kahnicus> @AngriestPat Stumble him when he dashes for an unlock!
[4:53:50] <切捨御免> this tyrant looks so good
[4:53:51] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> A and B on stream and off
[4:53:52] <CalderGaming> His Heart, It Beats For YOU
[4:53:52] <+Blackgaver> ge Ged the f up
[4:53:52] <Gruhunchously> I guess he really likes this game, huh?
[4:53:53] <lionandfox21> That's a pretty spicy tyrant
[4:53:54] <Beef_Broganoff> Look at that Kratos-esque dad bod
[4:53:57] <JonKhan> one beefy lad
[4:53:58] <+oOZtkOo> WutFace MR X
[4:54:00] <Geno4344> it's just not the same
[4:54:00] <+AXL808> Mr. X looks even bigger without his coat
[4:54:01] <%Niney_Who> THE MUSIC
[4:54:03] <dekkitout> TALK lS CHEAP MOTHAFUCKA!
[4:54:04] <+x24sonic> something gives me the impression you kind of like this game @AngriestPat
[4:54:04] <+Yokuho> I don't think he can get s+ cause he saved too much
[4:54:07] <%Kahnicus> FireClaw.
[4:54:08] <arcaderabbit48> What is it with the T-Virus and exposed organs
[4:54:08] <Gruhunchously> Now his arm is ON FIRE
[4:54:08] <daisymaisy02> ass clap ass clap ass clap ass clap ass clap ass clap ass clap ass clap ass clap ass clap ass clap ass clap ass clap
[4:54:09] <%TeraMercier> So this definitely isn't the same MR X that gets disemboweled?
[4:54:10] <+Sxy_T_Rex> sbfpWipeouts sbfpWipeouts sbfpWipeouts
[4:54:12] <bloodypurpledog> Alexa play Dicko Mode
[4:54:15] <taptapmuhgap> omg
[4:54:15] <majindusto> You wanna get nuts? LET'S GET NUTS!
[4:54:15] <Desertfishing> oh jeeze the back of my head
[4:54:16] <Beef_Broganoff> Was he always on fire too in the original? I can't remember
[4:54:21] <SeventyForce> X is gonna gice it to ya Through the fire and the flames
[4:54:23] <+runegod20> so the boss fights for each character is the same regardless of scenario
[4:54:23] <%CubicPhantom> see, take off leon's shirt and put it in the rain and Woolie'd be all up on this
[4:54:23] <Gruhunchously> @arcaderabbit48 This is the G-Virus, isn't it?
[4:54:25] <zoopbooploop> There's two Mr. X's
[4:54:27] <Highwang> HNNNNNNNNNNNGH
[4:54:29] <NepuNeppu> damn just eat it
[4:54:31] <taptapmuhgap> Mr. X is just Drax's socially akward cousin O.o
[4:54:31] <PrePaid_Hero> OOF
[4:54:34] <InugamiTheHound> in raccoon city we also had to fight a tyrant without its limiters and its was game elevator
[4:54:35] <+OKNewman> Missing that RE4 dodge roll about now
[4:54:38] <thatd00doverthere> eegghhhaaahhhh
[4:54:39] <切捨御免> eeeurrrraaagh
[4:54:40] <+Nomicro4u> He even does the anime hand swipe thing after hits
[4:54:43] <Geno4344> they timed his roar with the crescendo of the song in the OG re2
[4:54:46] <vicviper_t301> "Research shows that the Tyrant BOW would be much more effective if it didn't stop to pose after every successful slash"
[4:54:46] <+Mottyrob> That range is fucked
[4:54:46] <majindusto> Such a Triumphant intro for Tyrant!
[4:54:48] <TheTrueZyozz> Knew it.
[4:54:49] <%Kahnicus> I like how he does the same claw Riposte as the Tyrant in REmake.
[4:54:50] <Geno4344> felt off here BibleThump
[4:54:50] <arcaderabbit48> @TeraMercier Apparently multiples Xs were released into the city. Birkin kills one, Nemesis killed some more, and this is a totally different one
[4:54:53] <sackerkappa> Damn... Look at that juicy little slut.
[4:54:54] <+DGenerator> YEEEEEEErrrrrAHHHHHHHH
[4:54:55] <%SlugNut> eeeurrrraaagh
[4:54:55] <natebud> How many magnum rounds does it take to get to the center of a Mr. X?
[4:54:56] <daisymaisy02> eEEEUUUUUUAAAAARRRRGGGGGHHHHH
[4:54:57] <+psithen> EUGHHHHHHHHHHHHHaaaa
[4:55:01] <ThanksVideogames9> damn pat's really prepared for this
[4:55:01] <+DK_Rance> ayeeeeah
[4:55:03] <TafferAA> just tank it
[4:55:03] <lesbianmimikyu> Big dodges from pat
[4:55:05] <+Yokuho> Really bothers me that leon only has one grunt
[4:55:05] <AsinineWaffle> eeeeuuuraghhh
[4:55:06] <+oOZtkOo> a flaming tyrant arm is pretty strong
[4:55:07] <%pleasenameyourcharacter> Would Mr X just chase anybody, or is he targeting Leon amd Claire? Like, would he try this hard to kill Marvin or some rando?
[4:55:10] <person181> more than we have
[4:55:12] <%TeraMercier> Gotcha, I thought there was only one on my first way through
[4:55:17] <thatd00doverthere> EEUUGGHHaraaAaaaahhh
[4:55:17] <Allthegoodnamesweretak3n> Is there a time during their damage cycle where any weapon doesnt do damage?
[4:55:19] <%Implosivestar> EURRRRRRRRRRAGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH is way better than OWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOUA
[4:55:22] <Gruhunchously> Congratulations, you played yourself.
[4:55:23] <+runegod20> you know, when shao kahn would waste time during a boss fight, it would take the time to taunt instead of just standing around
[4:55:23] <arcaderabbit48> @Gruhunchously Mr. X is a T-Type Tyrant unrelated to the G-Virus. Tyrants are all about exposed organs, G-Virus is all about them thicc eyes
[4:55:25] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> X is chasing any survivors. He chases HUnk too
[4:55:28] <zoopbooploop> yeeee
[4:55:30] <Geno4344> IIRC the Mr. X's were programmed to murder the shit out of any survivors
[4:55:30] <%salty_syd913> yeyeye
[4:55:31] <Huitzil37> his range in this fight is bananas
[4:55:31] <CalderGaming> nice, no command grab
[4:55:32] <reonome> ADA WAIT
[4:55:34] <+Yokuho> Oh wow he never did the instakill
[4:55:34] <%pleasenameyourcharacter> Ah, okay.
[4:55:39] <%TeraMercier> @pleasenameyourcharacter The characters say that he's hunting survivors. These are the only two that are around X
[4:55:39] <%cureneckbeard> Attack his weak point for massive damage
[4:55:41] <+OKNewman> OHAI
[4:55:43] <+Mottyrob> SWEET
[4:55:44] <SchroedingersFerret> They should patch in RE4 death gurgles.
[4:55:44] <%texaporte> quick, use this!
[4:55:46] <RiverBirch> "You never left my side...rocket launcher."
[4:55:46] <+oOZtkOo> oh shit
[4:55:47] <TheTrueZyozz> @natebud, depends on the difficulty. I end up with excess ammo for the magnum on Assisted because I save it all.
[4:55:47] <arcaderabbit48> HOW BITCH
[4:55:47] <Highwang> okay that's a good touch on the Ada help
[4:55:48] <Gruhunchously> @arcaderabbit48 Sorry. I keep getting all these viruses mixed up.

[4:56:27] <$drfaustisdead> I forget which game introduces the fact that Umbrella dropped a ton of Tyrants in RC.

[4:56:34] <mastermidget23> @arcaderabbit48 Nemesis killed some of the Mr x's? I thought he pretty much had the same job as them, just more specific to stars members?
[4:56:34] <+dougrayman> you have the world record

[4:56:43] <+dickbuttwoman> S+ if he didn't use any infinites and didn't save more than 3 times

[4:56:50] <+Bakin1989> is there an achievemetn for sub 3hrs?
[4:56:51] <arcaderabbit48> @Gruhunchously For the record, Nemesis is also a T-Type Tyrant, they just finally managed to fix the "giant exposed weak point"
[4:56:52] <lloyddboy> can you kill him without the rockets?
[4:56:54] <%Plague_Nurse> A little disappointed that the A B scenarios aren't like the ones in original RE2
[4:56:56] <OToole42> he saved a bunch
[4:56:58] <%Corporate_Redeemer> SPEEDRUN COMPLETE
[4:56:58] <%BioApple> he saved about 23 more times than 3 times
[4:56:58] <TheTrueZyozz> @natebud, I use it all on Mr. X and G-5.
[4:56:58] <%Kahnicus> "Why don't I hate this bitch for trying to confuse me with her tits?"
[4:57:02] <%TeraMercier> I think he saved too many times for s+
[4:57:02] <%sirmackslot> Ever planning on getting S+ rank?
[4:57:02] <+MellowYellowFellow> there's still time for Claire B

[4:57:28] <arcaderabbit48> @mastermidget23 I admit I dont know? I keep hearing people say he did, but admittedly I don't know why he would? Because yeah, they're both Tyrants that would be working for Umbrella?
[4:57:28] <ScreamingMeat> No Sex For ANYONE
[4:57:30] <+Apokiliptickaos> why no bow gun in the game?
[4:57:32] <Desertfishing> aww he misses Ada
[4:57:33] <%TheMilhouseExperience> And this Leon went on to tell the president’s daughter ‘NWF!’
[4:57:35] <thatd00doverthere> I hope Leon never had to deal with anymore zombie things after this
[4:57:37] <+ArcLifth> Hey
[4:57:38] <%Piemen99> What's with that disney love music
[4:57:38] <Nova712> Fun Fact: If you start that fight with the IFR, you one shot him immediately.
[4:57:41] <natebud> @TheTrueZyozz I can never do that, always end up wasting a few on Lickers.

[5:05:10] <%TeraMercier> Hunk is the Legendary Death Knight of this universe
[5:05:10] <Beef_Broganoff> @dimeybot Nah by the time you see Mr X as Hunk Umbrella has ordered a full cleanup of Raccoon City
[5:05:13] <%Tearonex> most of the sewers you can honestly just walk passed, did like 20 attempts today and finally beat it witha 10:14
[5:05:14] <+dimeybot> Casual, Standard, Hardcore, Nightmare, Hunk
[5:05:16] <%cureneckbeard> SMG stands for S-rank Mcdonalds Ginger
[5:05:27] <+dickbuttwoman> Woooo half done
[5:05:31] <+runegod20> so how does mr X know, does he have an ear piece in or something
[5:05:33] <Desertfishing> stage clear
[5:05:34] <Warbot40> So what is this mode?
[5:05:34] <majindusto> Too be fair...This is still probably easier than the PS1 version
[5:05:34] <Bonbie> So, is it not viable at all to shoot your way through more of this?
[5:05:36] <Guardiansaiyan> Mister X says Hello!!
[5:05:36] <Run44forrest> im reading that dumb skeleton comic now
[5:05:40] <arcaderabbit48> Mr. X does not understand high fives. He only understands The Punch
[5:05:41] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Clap those cheeks to the beat
[5:05:45] <%maskedriderhero> @runegod20 He's programmed
[5:05:45] <Naho_Saenoki> @dimeybot And Tofu is a step above Hunk.
[5:05:51] <%Keyd00d> I need to see how to do the garage well
[5:05:54] <JJMR322> Hunk running simulator
[5:06:00] <%TeraMercier> @Bonbie No way you can barely manage to shoot like a quarter
[5:06:01] <%Tearonex> hate this licker
[5:06:01] <CalderGaming> @runegod20 he does actually have a device in the left side of his skull NEAR his ear
[5:06:04] <Allthegoodnamesweretak3n> nicely done
[5:06:05] <%mostundesired> WHO'S SNEEZING
[5:06:06] <+dimeybot> @naho_saenoki no one is a step above Hunk.
[5:06:10] <+Voidwyvern> just tuning in, how long has pat been at the Hunk game?
[5:06:10] <+x24sonic> oh my god i takes 3 magnum rounds for a licker holy shit
[5:06:11] <+runegod20> there's a ton of sections where you just can just run pass people, like the maingame @Bonbie
[5:06:13] <%Kahnicus> 'zat a deagle? sounds like a deagle.
[5:06:18] <%Plague_Nurse> 3 shots for a licker? Jesus
[5:06:18] <BeefyQueefer> did paige just died off camera?
[5:06:22] <arcaderabbit48> @runegod20 Mr. X is actually really dumb and has to be programmed with very specific commands that usually amount to "kill these people"
[5:06:24] <Bonbie> Jeez. This seems really cool then, no wonder people say Hunk is the shit
[5:06:28] <Run44forrest> Mr X is dummy thick the stomping is actually his asscheeks clapping
[5:06:28] <TheTrueZyozz> Half way.
[5:06:32] <+hillbillypowpow> WHO'S SNEEZING?
[5:06:34] <AntChodeny> Paige has left the chatroom
[5:06:34] <%Tearonex> Parking garage and courtyard are the worst rooms in this mode
[5:06:35] <TheTrueZyozz> Just run.
[5:06:36] <+runegod20> actually using the frags and flashes isntead of just keeping them to counter grabs do clear up areas a ton

[5:06:52] <PSI_Guy95> HUNK putting everyone on a grenade diet
[5:06:53] <+Alig200> @Tearonex 2 shotgun shells seems to handle parking garage fairly well.
[5:06:54] <TheTrueZyozz> No more flashes. You needed them for Mr. X.
[5:06:54] <The_Blumper> dud
[5:06:56] <MrGreenToS> I've seen people toss a flash into that room
[5:07:01] <%JGardner88> What I do for that is hug left and run past into the left doggo
[5:07:02] <%maskedriderhero> Synchronized rise up
[5:07:03] <%Keyd00d> NICE GARAGE
[5:07:07] <%TeraMercier> @Bonbie Hunk is a super experienced operative in canon, he's probably done a dozen missions where there wan't time to even look at all the bullshit going on
[5:07:07] <TheTrueZyozz> Nope.
[5:07:08] <+Yokuho> Damn
[5:07:12] <TheTrueZyozz> Why!?!?

[5:08:52] <arkv01> hunk sounds soooooo dreamy
[5:08:53] <arcaderabbit48> @thelilliestoflivers At this point, Mr. X's kill switch has been flipped and he's on orders to paste anything he sees

[5:11:16] <arcaderabbit48> It should be noted that the fact that Nemesis is designed to go after specific people in STARS and not just everyone in general is a huge accomplishment in-universe. Tyrants are FUCKING STUPID.

[5:12:25] <+runegod20> ah, so i guess still useful if poison actually does happen
[5:12:30] <arcaderabbit48> @PSI_Guy95 Yep! The fact that Nemesis can vocalize even a single word is a small miracle, and him lacking an exposed vital organ is part of what makes him so special.
