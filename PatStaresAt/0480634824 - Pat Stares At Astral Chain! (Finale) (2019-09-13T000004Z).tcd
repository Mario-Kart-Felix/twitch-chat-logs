[0:20:48] <%Futurecity10> @AngriestPat The censor was from "To Train me to be a good, submissive wife, he'd do things like tie me to a chair and leave me there all day, challenging me to stay quiet." to "To train me to be a good wife, he'd do things like tie me to a chair"

[0:21:23] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Dude I miss streams constantly.. hell I'm missing this stream *RIGHT NOW*. .-.
[0:21:24] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> WHa...they got rid of the "submissive" part? But that makes it even more heinous and fucked up, which was the fuckin point, right?
[0:21:25] <%Keaton_x> Even if it's just on in the background, I'm always watching you, Wazowski
[0:21:30] <%Agami23> @AngriestPat did you hear about rooster teeth?
[0:21:31] <%depressed_skeleton> biggerer

[0:21:56] <+Darren716> RED COP
[0:22:00] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat I mean, the best part of the stream sure aint your gameplay LUL
[0:22:00] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> @Agami23 What about Roosterteeth?
[0:22:00] <@lewdskeletor13> Wouldn’t he have to hear what you daid
[0:22:02] <%Soul_Intern> Lets do an Astral Chain
[0:22:03] <+Dreadlord134> He talk about playing borderlands 3 tonight?
[0:22:06] <%razielhex> razielhex subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 2 month streak! Making Biggs, Wedge, and Jessie good looking rather than side- comic relief means post-Millenials who missed out on the '96-'97 release are gonna get their hearts broken when they get impaled by railing at the end.
[0:22:10] <%InugamiTheHound> @FirearmsInstructor what are you cooking?
[0:22:13] <%brickwall35> I'm the only one watching, everyone else are bots I set up
[0:22:14] <%Soul_Intern> b o b b e r
[0:22:16] <%Agami23> @Zaphire_Saucypants they layed off 13% of their employees
[0:22:17] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @FirearmsInstructor Toss some of that grub over here chief.
[0:22:19] <ShichiNoBushi> Red Cop...
[0:22:20] <%depressed_skeleton> better cook enough for the whole stream
[0:22:21] <%PROUD2beGINGER> PROUD2beGINGER subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months! I just finished this game and I have to say, it's not a true Platinum game without a QTE that makes me laugh maniacally with excitement.
[0:22:21] <%McSnazzyPants> daemon x machina waiting room
[0:22:22] <%Bane_Kaikyo> <3
[0:22:25] <%gryffinp> "Finale?" is, I think, optimistic.
[0:22:25] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> @Agami23 Oh shit.
[0:22:26] <%Louie_Salmon> Whoever I just accidentally friend requested in chat, that was a mistake my bad

[0:22:49] <gimmickypizza> red cop
[0:22:51] <%gryffinp> Yeah I got gift subbed against my will while I happened to have a tab idling
[0:22:59] <%RubberFistFight> @Agami23 for the record, whilst layoffs suck, they're also part and parcel of business/employment. However, a 13% layoff is fucking crazy.
[0:23:01] <ShichiNoBushi> Yoseph: "You're a loose cannon, Red Cop!"
[0:23:02] <%king_wragles> @floralkami so female MC has best ending, got it

[0:27:33] <T_Sasquatch> I tried Borderlands 2, it's just not fufilling ,at all
[0:27:40] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat The "White neuron set" was mostly blue though...
[0:27:41] <ShichiNoBushi> Blue
[0:27:45] <Sphincter_Spelunker> That's a navy blue
[0:27:46] <+CharredChord> There's a bunch of custom color sets
[0:27:46] <%Chichen> "purple"
[0:27:47] <%Jeemukun> I recently found out the concept artist for this game also did the designs for tiger & bunny, I knew this game looked fammilar for some reason
[0:27:48] <%1matheuw> but thats blu tho
[0:27:49] <%Soul_Intern> porplu

[0:28:24] <%doc_ock_rokc> @worldbrand goes for 60 plat
[0:28:29] <+twohitgood> so i saw that cleaning them actually does something and makes them a little faster and have faster attack strings?
[0:28:32] <%1matheuw> ive seen someone saying on the stream that makes them faster
[0:28:33] <DSD24> @Soul_Intern Marie is a good choice
[0:28:34] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> there's a whiter color set out there.

[0:28:53] <T_Sasquatch> did you just call TEAL , GREEN LUK
[0:28:54] <+crimsonharvest> 20 should be renamed 'color set woolie'
[0:28:54] <%corinv> Taura said on twitter that legion maintenance makes your legion "more proactive in battle"
[0:28:56] <%Louie_Salmon> You can customize these if you want btw
[0:28:59] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> That "green" is turquoise.
[0:29:00] <%Ranryu692> @AngriestPat it's for getting 500,000 money

[0:29:40] <%doc_ock_rokc> @DSD24 so that is why I mentally labled that color scheme "the concept of love"
[0:29:42] <%SilvaChariot0133> HERE WE GO PogChamp
[0:29:42] <%dekkitout> No! GOD! NO GOD, NO! NOOOOO!
[0:29:42] <%BoboDaHobo> This is easier than the ice cream

[0:30:03] <DSD24> @doc_ock_rokc It was what first came to mind
[0:30:07] <%PROUD2beGINGER> Don't drop them even once for S+
[0:30:09] <ShutenDragoon> I hate this mission purely for one reason
[0:30:09] <%Soul_Intern> UNDER THREE MINUTES

[0:30:10] <%doc_ock_rokc> Oh boy SLIDE PUZZLE MK 2

[0:30:18] <%rumtumtugnutz> Weaknesses are my only weakness.
[0:30:19] <ShichiNoBushi> Also cops run around and bump into you like jerks.
[0:30:23] <jcflyguy> S+ first try
[0:30:26] <Sphincter_Spelunker> he didn't read it again
[0:30:26] <+Jonesman64> this one is actually a lot easier
[0:30:30] <anuchallengertwitch> Y'know this would be a lot easier with a legion
[0:30:31] <%McSnazzyPants> this one's actually really easy to s+
[0:30:33] <%PaleBloodInk> One of the things I hate in these is the animations take so long. You burn through four whole seconds just waiting to actually pick up the boxes.
[0:30:34] <cureneckbeard> death stranding

[0:32:22] <%Soul_Intern> THAT WAS CLOSE
[0:32:25] <%corinv> Good idea, get your stand that is constantly writhing in agony to carefully carry these boxes
[0:32:25] <%SergeantSov> PHASE 3
[0:32:25] <ape_hawk> FUCK YOU

[0:32:35] <%Louie_Salmon> @floralkami You can use the right stick but if you use gyro at all (I.E., move the controller at all), it takes over, so it's more reliable to just use the gyro
[0:32:35] <%InugamiTheHound> lifting that many boxes is not good for your back
[0:32:35] <imontwitch> what a time to join the stream lmao, why are they running?

[0:35:38] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @doc_ock_rokc It's the little things in life, you know?
[0:35:44] <KilljoyHexx> we all need a nut sometimes
[0:35:48] <%Soul_Intern> apatBig Memory
[0:35:48] <Strider222> he needs a nut, nut and a NUT
[0:35:51] <%brickwall35> NUT
[0:35:51] <%gryffinp> You can even use the additional details button on the notes list, and the ones he needs will say so in their description
[0:35:51] <%1matheuw> he needs some bussy
[0:35:52] <%shawntk_> pat you forgot the suspension
[0:35:53] <%SergeantSov> Tasty floor medicine
[0:36:02] <%Louie_Salmon> He definitely needs a nut, spring, and bolt
[0:36:06] <%Keyd00d> Pat you forgot one
[0:36:11] <+Clik404> @sergeantsov pop it in your fucking gon
[0:36:26] <+Clik404> Gob, autocorrect I swear
[0:36:32] <%hazzy_o7> Do you actually plan to stay up till the end of this?
[0:36:37] <Derkinstacker> It's still not open.
[0:36:38] <%dekkitout> He said a spanner, sprocket, and headlight fluid Kappa
[0:36:41] <%doc_ock_rokc> No
[0:36:42] <%Divryne> WOOOOOOOOOOW.
[0:36:42] <DSD24> Yes
[0:36:43] <Sphincter_Spelunker> call him Mr. Abacus, you can count on him
[0:36:43] <This_is_Marco> D:
[0:36:44] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> I need to SCREW this NUT on this large bolt. Gotta make certain the nipple is closed first.
[0:36:45] <%ToadKing> X
[0:36:45] <%rumtumtugnutz> He's not going to finish tonight
[0:36:46] <%Laecerelius> Kiiiinda
[0:36:47] <%Soul_Intern> apatBig GRIND
[0:36:48] <+Jonesman64> SMALL LEVEL
[0:36:49] <%doc_ock_rokc> Not leveled at all
[0:36:50] <Mendin> He did a little offscreen grinding
[0:36:50] <%1matheuw> grinded a little
[0:36:50] <%Shadicara> apatBig apatBig apatBig
[0:36:51] <+CharredChord> all of them?
[0:36:53] <+stellarseeker> "So I grinded a bit off screen"
[0:36:53] <%Keyd00d> damn
[0:36:53] <%BoboDaHobo> @hazzy_o7 no, he's finishing it on Saturday
[0:36:57] <%rumtumtugnutz> Actual finale for AC will be Saturday Afternoon
[0:36:59] <%InugamiTheHound> grinding off screen and became GIANT!!
[0:37:02] <anuchallengertwitch> Jena can wait, I need to raise my relationship with my coworkers.
[0:37:06] <+Jonesman64> axe is only CX LUL
[0:37:13] <%hazzy_o7> Cool
[0:37:14] <agumon9000> Wow the final boss is going to be a joke lmao
[0:37:17] <%FirearmsInstructor> Ok I only caught the first part of this game where the dad was sacrificing himself after all the stands got free... now you're stacking boxes at helicopters and getting nuts and bolts? WTF is this game??
[0:37:18] <Derkinstacker> Axe is the best.
[0:37:18] <+CharredChord> me too
[0:37:18] <%Soul_Intern> Clean off that grind juice
[0:37:20] <%skizzuto> he a BIG STRONG
[0:37:21] <ultimate_joker_main> he's ok
[0:37:21] <%Divryne> Dad's pretty good.
[0:37:22] <%Louie_Salmon> Ah, so they do end up with 5 ability slots. That's nice.
[0:37:27] <%Divryne> Big and strong.,
[0:37:29] <bigstupidjellyfish1337> HE HATES IT
[0:37:30] <Tisaric> Axe legion does so much fucking damage
[0:37:30] <%Shadicara> You're gonna job the last boss
[0:37:31] <%ArcanumMBD> axe legion likes you
[0:37:31] <T_Sasquatch> Astral chain will never be AC
[0:37:32] <%gryffinp> @FirearmsInstructor Japanese.
[0:37:32] <%rumtumtugnutz> Does using Axe Legion make you Axe Cop?
[0:37:33] <%BoboDaHobo> Axe is best by far
[0:37:37] <DSD24> Axe Arm and Beast are my favorites
[0:37:39] <+Jonesman64> I do like the versatility of sward boi tho
[0:37:44] <%dekkitout> He's great for when you need to axe someone a question
[0:37:47] <UnfilteredComic> They all Cap at 5
[0:37:47] <%FirearmsInstructor> @gryffinp .... yea you're right... :|
[0:37:51] <%Ascethetic> i just like that Arms legion is just a gorilla
[0:37:54] <%rumtumtugnutz> Astral Chain is already AC. Just like Ace Combat and that other AC game.
[0:37:58] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> can't wait to see that shit
[0:37:59] <%rumtumtugnutz> I can
[0:38:00] <%Louie_Salmon> @t_sasquatch Air Conditioners have too much mindshare
[0:38:01] <ALazo> I still don't see a point to this outside of making it hard to see the color you pick for them in the selector
[0:38:03] <%corinv> Final boss is still pretty tough, I had 2k hp and a couple legions maxed when I reached it and it wasn't a pushover
[0:38:05] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> or rather, your reaction to that shit.
[0:38:05] <%SergeantSov> Give the good boi a bath
[0:38:06] <+Zereaux> @AngriestPat does the mc's silhouette remind you of sam's from vanquish
[0:38:07] <Tisaric> I really enjoy the doggo skills
[0:38:08] <%rumtumtugnutz> I can't remember what it's called.
[0:38:15] <Tisaric> the lightning chain is so good
[0:38:17] <ape_hawk> AXE COP
[0:38:18] <%rumtumtugnutz> Aheron's Call!
[0:38:18] <%InugamiTheHound> does Axe legion make the others useless now?
[0:38:19] <T_Sasquatch> Clean your slaves
[0:38:24] <%nmaten> is this the new nintendogs?
[0:38:24] <%StaceMcGate> PogChamp1000 PogChamp1000 Love this game but good lord are all the characters wet blankets
[0:38:33] <%rumtumtugnutz> *Asheron's Call
[0:38:35] <ultimate_joker_main> @InugamiTheHound nah he slow
[0:38:36] <+Risingxiv> is the Axe weapon clipping into the wall?
[0:38:42] <%Shadicara> So yes
[0:38:51] <This_is_Marco> axe parry is great
[0:38:57] <%king_wragles> Was it just me, or was Axe the most chill about getting cleaned? He was moving around a bunch, but didn't really swing at the MC
[0:38:59] <%Ranryu692> I used to think Arms was slow. then I got Axe
[0:39:01] <+Wool> what chapter is Pat on right now?
[0:39:02] <%Soul_Intern> If you like the axe legion yes, if you have another favorite no
[0:39:04] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> go for middle
[0:39:06] <%BoboDaHobo> all the other legions are functions, axe is a character
[0:39:06] <%gryffinp> Sword and Arm are genuinely useful for different combat styles, Arrow and Beast are only useful when the game forces them through specific mechanics
[0:39:09] <%doc_ock_rokc> big number
[0:39:10] <Mendin> Buff the Pupper
[0:39:19] <Derkinstacker> It sure is
[0:39:22] <%Louie_Salmon> Buffer Pupper
[0:39:23] <%CalderGaming> autobind is gr8
[0:39:25] <%corinv> Nah beast is suuuper useful a lot of the time
[0:39:28] <%GeneralSCPatton> @king_wragles They only act up if you pet badly too many times.
[0:39:28] <+Wool> awww I can't watch tonight then. I'm only on 8 :'(
[0:39:33] <Tisaric> autobind is super great
[0:39:33] <%corinv> Being able to instantly auto dodge anything is a big lifesaver
[0:39:34] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> multi chaining bonus
[0:39:34] <%Chichen> @AngriestPat Pat with HItrush you can release one of your legions, then swap to another one and have 2 out
[0:39:34] <%ArcanumMBD> Autobind is for cowards
[0:39:35] <UnfilteredComic> I used autobind on arm because hes so slow
[0:39:36] <%shurtal> swol patrol
[0:39:37] <%skizzuto> It's great especially on the slower legions like Axe
[0:39:37] <%StaceMcGate> Arrow really improves late game, Arm is best DPS, and I haven't used Axe apart from his blue shield
[0:39:38] <joeinky> with hit rush you can swap to a different legion and pull that out as well
[0:39:39] <%Soul_Intern> WAIFU
[0:39:43] <%miguelrod777> thicc
[0:39:44] <+Darren716> Autobind is for scrubs
[0:39:44] <%Shadicara> Big tiddy
[0:39:45] <%MoulesFritz> damn
[0:39:45] <anuchallengertwitch> @AngriestPat Pat is this or is this not the best "Evangelion" game currently
[0:39:45] <%gasgrave> This game is about to get fucking crazy.
[0:39:48] <%InugamiTheHound> look at them huge tits
[0:39:48] <%MoulesFritz> those are some big tiddies
[0:39:49] <ShichiNoBushi> I figured that Auto-Bind was pointless since it does what you can do already.
[0:39:50] <+Jonesman64> BIG TIDDY COP GF
[0:39:50] <%rumtumtugnutz> JESUS she's got some tits
[0:39:51] <%doc_ock_rokc> ITS LAPPYS HANDLER
[0:39:51] <PrimeNeverproc> tifa wannabe
[0:39:53] <%Ascethetic> big tiddy nerd gf
[0:39:54] <+Clik404> @gryffinp nah, Beast is dodge master and I use arrow all the time against fast/flying enemies
[0:39:54] <+Zereaux> gonna beat it cuz spoilers have fun stream
[0:39:54] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> I call her pancakes, cuz she stacked.
[0:39:56] <%kyh9> Auto bind undermines the point of the system
[0:39:59] <This_is_Marco> I just spam circle + arm legion call to ora everything
[0:40:01] <DSD24> Brenda's cute too
[0:40:04] <+Risingxiv> Autobind unique LUL
[0:40:07] <Derkinstacker> Hit rush on arrow is great since you can keep things juggled with it.
[0:40:08] <%Koosahmii> Tifa with glasses?
[0:40:08] <%PROUD2beGINGER> Auto Bind is great for sneaking missions
[0:40:10] <ape_hawk> jena is a whackjob, fools
[0:40:12] <+Darren716> She aint smart enough to shower
[0:40:13] <%Louie_Salmon> @anuchallengertwitch Between this and the old ass fighting game? Is there literally anything else?
[0:40:17] <%42nfl19> Dark blue and yellow? Are we UK cops now?
[0:40:23] <%kyh9> Favorite?
[0:40:28] <%Soul_Intern> @ape_hawk I wanna whack HER job
[0:40:31] <%GeneralSCPatton> Having 2 legions out at once stacks their Ability buffs.
[0:40:33] <ShichiNoBushi> File 09/11
[0:40:33] <ALazo> Must be the first end of the game then
[0:40:35] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat This is like Ghostbusters X Transformers X Pokemon... all rolled into an animus game.
[0:40:35] <ShawnEXE> I was doing post game missions and the only legion that has really lost usability for me is the arm legion somehow
[0:40:38] <Mendin> please hack the work cameras
[0:40:39] <%Divryne> IT'S FASTER.
[0:40:39] <+CharredChord> its faster
[0:40:39] <%StaceMcGate> Wait, Pat is only chapter 9? I thought he'd be post game by now
[0:40:40] <%Ranryu692> faster
[0:40:41] <%gryffinp> Some fuckin THIEF???!??!?
[0:40:41] <starlitalpha> its faster
[0:40:44] <%dukenux> UNATCO?
[0:40:46] <agumon9000> Considering its Nine out of Elev- Good job cutting yourself off.@AngriestPat
[0:40:47] <%skizzuto> it's faster when you have a stand
[0:40:49] <%1matheuw> why not just look at the video ?
[0:40:50] <+Jonesman64> FUCK CLEARANCE
[0:40:50] <ape_hawk> ITS A BOXMAN
[0:40:50] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> do it, you elite hacker.
[0:40:56] <%BoboDaHobo> @42nfl19 it's purple, trust pat
[0:41:02] <anuchallengertwitch> @Louie_Salmon That game let you punch with buildings as leliel
[0:41:04] <WanderingSwordsman> there's a lot of red tape
[0:41:11] <+CharredChord> There must be a witness
[0:41:12] <%Louie_Salmon> The fact that Sword legion can both grab and cut DATA is wild
[0:41:15] <KitsuneManami> @AngriestPat Is your BGM turned up?
[0:41:20] <%Louie_Salmon> Like that is straight up a stand ability
[0:41:32] <%Soul_Intern> YEAH PULL OUT THE DATA
[0:41:34] <+malacante> HERMITO PAPUL
[0:41:37] <T_Sasquatch> Look at those honkers
[0:41:40] <%StaceMcGate> Sword Legion has the most functions, curing dimensional aids and hacking cameras
[0:41:40] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> check nooo
[0:41:44] <%nmaten> elevators have cameras
[0:41:44] <Derkinstacker> Check it
[0:41:46] <%InugamiTheHound> do the others know you throwing a stand at the camera?

[0:42:25] <%Louie_Salmon> @shawnexe Don't forget beast legion has the invincible Dodge sync, along with arm
[0:42:26] <Tisaric> Howl and the electric chain did so much for me
[0:42:32] <%GeneralSCPatton> @louie_salmon Sword Legion is fluent in both binary and encryption. They were electives at FDU: Frame-rate Dimension University.

[0:43:19] <%brickwall35> just open the elevator then have the footage start
[0:43:23] <ArmoredRevenger> brute force it lol

[0:43:29] <%Soul_Intern> BRUTEEEEEE
[0:43:30] <KitsuneManami> lol
[0:43:32] <ShawnEXE> @StaceMcGate Visit old missions, ton of places where you needed an unavailable legion. Those places have premiums
[0:43:32] <Derkinstacker> So much time wasted
[0:43:33] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> I love how Pat deliberately ignores the prompt that tells him to check the data. He is so good at video games, he has to make it harder on himself.

[0:44:13] <+Darren716> Jena just blew up 5 orphanages while you were doing that

[0:44:18] <%skizzuto> there's a terrorist to apprehend

[0:44:28] <ape_hawk> i like how jena is doing a 9/11 RIGHT NOW but you have sidequests to do first
[0:44:29] <%Soul_Intern> Redu coppu
[0:44:29] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Those orphanges knew what they were doing
[0:44:35] <Derkinstacker> Those orphans were gonna blow up anyways.
[0:44:35] <%Divryne> They were dead anyways.
[0:44:38] <Sphincter_Spelunker> who's gonna miss those orphans
[0:44:38] <%nmaten> not like anyones gonna miss them
[0:44:39] <%StaceMcGate> This whole mission was a wild ride, "This isn't even my final form"
[0:44:39] <%InugamiTheHound> was that Johnny from MGS games?
[0:44:39] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat This game's fucking weird, man... japanese, right?
[0:44:40] <DSD24> They were asking for it
[0:44:41] <Tisaric> oh man I can't wait for this case
[0:44:42] <Sphincter_Spelunker> their parents?
[0:44:47] <%doc_ock_rokc> sned the bill to their parents

[0:45:00] <agumon9000> Jena just summoned 3 homunculi! You'll have to fight the same boss 3 TIMES IN A ROW!!
[0:45:02] <Derkinstacker> No it'll be great
[0:45:04] <agumon9000> Wait you already did that
[0:45:09] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> This is totally going to work.
[0:45:10] <%Louie_Salmon> Those orphans were just gonna grow up to do big crime, so that was actually good police work
[0:45:20] <%GeneralSCPatton> Jena injected the orphans with the chimera juice, and then fed them to HOMUNCULUS OMEGA
[0:45:21] <%Divryne> LUL
[0:45:24] <%rumtumtugnutz> One of these two is gonna die, aren't they? This seems like a 'one of us is gonna die" moment.
[0:45:32] <%StaceMcGate> Jena did nothing wrong

[0:46:34] <ShawnEXE> The axe legion is the main damage dealer but against the fast bosses, sword legion is great
[0:46:37] <Derkinstacker> Corrupted sex energy.
[0:46:38] <%Laecerelius> Redshift sex energy
[0:46:41] <cureneckbeard> it's the hiss
[0:46:44] <DSD24> Redshiftism?
[0:46:45] <%McSnazzyPants> @AngriestPat corruption levels are so high that everything is starting to redshift
[0:46:51] <+Darren716> Man i totally forgot about the first half of this mission
[0:46:58] <KitsuneManami> @AngriestPat "Oh no my little Boy, he loves Red Sex Juice"

[0:47:00] <Mendin> It's the Hiss leaking over
[0:47:00] <%Louie_Salmon> The music in this game whiplashes between beats to study/relax to, and dubstep buttrock
[0:47:00] <%dekkitout> Tags: Shotacon
[0:47:03] <%GeneralSCPatton> The very fabric of reality being corrupted, by the bullshit
[0:47:04] <%Divryne> Red cherry-poppin' juice.
[0:47:06] <%CalderGaming> male!akira starts sounding like a huge tool after becoming Red Cop
[0:47:08] <ShichiNoBushi> Can't have the kids exposed to the sex juice.
[0:47:10] <+Darren716> I remember it starting at the tunnel
[0:47:11] <%Laecerelius> I wish I could do something but I'm so busy being kinda worthless over here...
[0:47:15] <T_Sasquatch> Oh dear

[0:48:27] <%spacehouse> Sniff the Lappy doll' s sex energy
[0:48:34] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> That dog monster wants to hunt that child down for dinner.

[0:49:16] <%Soul_Intern> PENETRATE

[0:49:40] <PrimeNeverproc> damn jenna got another one
[0:49:41] <%Louie_Salmon> You should go in here, get all the loot, and then just come back and say there was nothing anyone could do
[0:49:42] <%dukenux> @blackorchidKI2
[0:49:44] <T_Sasquatch> @louie_salmon its so the dumb player knows its detective vision . I unironically played most of Arkham ayslum with it on
[0:49:48] <KitsuneManami> THAT HAPPENED TO ME IN THE SAME SPOT! Lol!
[0:49:49] <%SilvaChariot0133> LUL
[0:49:51] <ShawnEXE> Everything is cooler in framerate hell
[0:49:51] <%Soul_Intern> hehehehehehhehe
[0:49:52] <KitsuneManami> LUL
[0:49:55] <%supersugoisenpai1> This hole was made for me
[0:49:55] <Derkinstacker> Pat sleeps in the frame rate dimension, which he believes gives him sexual powers.
[0:50:01] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> The most annoying thing in this game is the goddamn fall damage.
[0:50:05] <Saltmeisterr> hello some one catch me up on this file
[0:50:13] <Saltmeisterr> just got here
[0:50:20] <%dukenux> @blackorchidKI2 "He was a good boy. *smack* What a rotten way to die."
[0:50:20] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> File 9
[0:50:24] <ape_hawk> evil smelly lady is doing a big 9/11
[0:50:26] <%malacante> Jena's being evil again, gotta get her
[0:50:27] <%doc_ock_rokc> Axe Kune
[0:50:28] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> Just started.
[0:50:29] <KitsuneManami> @AngriestPat Why is he so slow on manual movement but normal speed when following? Its so dum
[0:50:29] <%StaceMcGate> the most annoying part is your legions assuming direct control of your camera
[0:50:32] <%SilvaChariot0133> *Whisltes Innocently*4
[0:50:40] <ShichiNoBushi> Wow. Already a third of the way.
[0:50:41] <%SilvaChariot0133> *whistles
[0:50:46] <%dekkitout> Pat carried some boxes, fetched some junk, and is now looking for a dead child
[0:50:48] <Saltmeisterr> what kind of big evil?
[0:50:49] <+OUTheTeam> remember jena
[0:50:52] <%supersugoisenpai1> She's a red cop, she can take it
[0:50:52] <Dragovus> @AngriestPat Remember to arrest the child for littering by leaving his lappy doll on the ground
[0:50:52] <Mendin> that makes sense of Jenna is eating out
[0:50:53] <ALazo> so close yet so far
[0:50:54] <%Soul_Intern> ALMOST
[0:50:55] <Sphincter_Spelunker> @SilvaChariot0133 you did it
[0:50:58] <%CalderGaming> edgeguarded!
[0:50:58] <agumon9000> Ah yes the good Platforming
[0:51:00] <ShawnEXE> Nah the most annoying thing in the game is revisting a section of the level to get an S+ rank but the specific red case is at the very end of the section and then you fail it so you need to do it all over again.
[0:51:01] <%Soul_Intern> ALMOST A HYPE MOMENT
[0:51:08] <%Soul_Intern> OH YEAH
[0:51:08] <%Louie_Salmon> @t_sasquatch I guess, I just hate walking through an area with everything blue, moving the dog everywhere to look for hidden items, and mashing my character against every wall to see if it's an illusory wall
[0:51:08] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> yes
[0:51:09] <%SilvaChariot0133> Typing hard
[0:51:09] <%skizzuto> because you're pulling him along maybe?

[0:51:19] <Sphincter_Spelunker> I was looking at chat, sorry
[0:51:20] <%skizzuto> LUL
[0:51:21] <%malacante> I wasn't watching better do it again
[0:51:23] <%Soul_Intern> Nice
[0:51:30] <Derkinstacker> Axe legion did something cool, what a surprise.
[0:51:30] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> I also saw the anti-cool
[0:51:31] <%Louie_Salmon> I saw that for sure
[0:51:31] <Strider222> you forgot some red stuff
[0:51:45] <T_Sasquatch> I can see the nier automata technology
[0:51:46] <%1matheuw> ded

[0:52:03] <%StaceMcGate> cure his space aids
[0:52:04] <%doc_ock_rokc> He will turn into a monster later
[0:52:08] <ape_hawk> "why is his head spinning and vomiting red stuff?!"
[0:52:12] <%Laecerelius> He would've become red goo or something like that
[0:52:12] <%spacehouse> Now my son has the SEX ENERGY
[0:52:13] <%malacante> Chimeras don't kill you, they just want you to sit there till you get corrupted
[0:52:16] <%Louie_Salmon> So we can can just BAMF out of the framerate dimension now?
[0:52:19] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> more like cross-dimensional aids.

[0:52:26] <Sphincter_Spelunker> You just killed the mom by bringing back the redshifted kid

[0:52:50] <%dekkitout> Man, lots of dead kids this file

[0:52:59] <%StaceMcGate> remember when the astral plain was this great unknown and now it's in-out in 20 mins?
[0:53:03] <agumon9000> OH GOD JENA HAS JUST TOPPLED DOWN TWO MASSIVE TOWERS IN ZONE 11

[0:54:05] <ALazo> blue shield is such a good skill
[0:54:05] <%reonome> guys fighting two monsters doesn't automatically mean they're agni and rudra
[0:54:06] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> I've always loved the whole red oni/blue oni trope. Probably my favorite one.
[0:54:09] <Sphincter_Spelunker> I thought it was gonna say Kodos and Kang
[0:54:10] <%Louie_Salmon> Get that blue shield on my dude
[0:54:12] <joeinky> the amount of side boss fights that actually have unique models in this game is kinda ridiculous
[0:54:12] <%McSnazzyPants> the real agni and rudra was capaneus and astraeus

[0:56:27] <+Jonesman64> took me forever to realize it was the same cat
[0:56:35] <%malacante> Pat hit Mia like a statue of the Thinker
[0:56:37] <%supersugoisenpai1> They put the red in her
[0:56:42] <%kyh9> The other guy was supposed to throw him
[0:56:44] <anuchallengertwitch> One of these days, a cat is going to be a secret boss in a platinum game and it's going to be super difficult

[0:57:21] <%Solidnick18> time for potty
[0:57:21] <%Soul_Intern> O-oh?
[0:57:22] <%gryffinp> The actual answer as to why her outfit is different is: We don't know, it's kinda nuts. After she got injured she showed up out of the blue in the middle of a fight wearing red and black armor that says RAVEN on it instead of blue and white armor with NEURON on it. Mysteeeeeerious.
[0:57:23] <agumon9000> @AngriestPat If it isn't like very noticable. Simply by how the ranking system works, early in the game you'll get shit like D/C ranks because you don't have all the options yet
[0:57:23] <%rumtumtugnutz> It's because they are the chosen ones who have to parent Purple Cop
[0:57:24] <%Divryne> SHUT UP I'M PISSING.
[0:57:24] <blackorchidKI2> "I DID IT, ALL ME"
[0:57:25] <%doc_ock_rokc> Sorry BROWN ROCK demons

[1:00:02] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> If blue is good, and red is evil, then is purple neutral?
[1:00:02] <DSMatticus> In true Evangelion fashion, the final boss is a bag of tang.

[1:00:17] <%Soul_Intern> @King_Wolf_Rigger Woolie is the proof of that
[1:00:27] <%corinv> @AngriestPat There's a bullshit hidden case before you proceed, do you wanna know how to get it?
[1:00:32] <xcompleasedad> THAT IS SO COOL
[1:00:33] <%dekkitout> @RubberFistFight The Fat Evil did the REd Ice, no?
[1:00:35] <$arcielardor> so do people see the chain or is that invisible too?
[1:00:36] <%StaceMcGate> skill
[1:00:48] <Sphincter_Spelunker> @arcielardor it's "astral"
[1:00:49] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @Soul_Intern Does that mean that Pat is evil?

[1:04:56] <joeinky> all except the box game
[1:04:58] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Crazy Talk activated, it actually looked like sword legion, but Pat's stand changed it to an arrow legion.
[1:05:01] <+BlindingFlash> too bad about the boxes
[1:05:02] <anuchallengertwitch> Maybe it's supposed to be the full Chimera equivalent
[1:05:03] <+Darren716> Yeah because youre max level nerd

[1:05:18] <%supersugoisenpai1> Astral Chain seems super generous with S ranks compared to past games

[1:06:20] <ScreamLord> So Dad's Legion is called Axe? But it's clearly using a giant ass SWORD
[1:06:20] <+CharredChord> 10,000 points gives you an S+ rank. It depends on how generous the time bonus is.

[1:07:45] <agumon9000> TO FIGHT THE SAME BOSS FOR THE 5TH TIME IN A ROW!
[1:07:45] <%pilgrimsayswhat> The true enemy of humanity was showers all along, Smash was right
[1:07:47] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Time Square, noooo!
[1:07:47] <KitsuneManami> Like your Boss Stage? lol
[1:07:48] <All_MightOFA> 20 years no shower
[1:07:48] <%Solidnick18> Um
[1:07:50] <@lewdskeletor13> PogChamp100 PogChamp100 PogChamp100 PogChamp100 PogChamp100 sorry to dredge sad stuff earlier, now let’s talk about Spoder-Man. No idea if you read comics but I’d highly recommend a 6 part series called Spider-Man: Life Story (written by a fellow Canuck). Each issue takes place in a different decade starting in the 60’s to 2019. You get to see Peter age in real time from 1962 with great remixes on Spidey stories. It also involves stuff like Iron Man and Cap fighting over Vietnam. Good shit.
[1:07:52] <vonmaultke> They wouldn't be red if they could dodge red Pat Jebaited
[1:07:52] <%Solidnick18> Oh no
[1:07:53] <%dekkitout> Wasn't Red Cop born in the red, while we merely adopted the red?
[1:07:53] <+FackuIkari> ARE YOU READY?!
[1:07:55] <%42nfl19> Don't worry, that's the same crystals you wash off your legions @AngriestPat
[1:07:56] <%Divryne> Very carefully.
[1:07:57] <+Caped_Eggy> Big boi 2019
[1:07:59] <%Solidnick18> they just get birthed
[1:07:59] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> I think this is what happened to the rest of the world.
[1:08:00] <Strider222> in the astral plain?
[1:08:00] <%StaceMcGate> they got alot of mileage out of this boss model
[1:08:00] <%skizzuto> the Astral Plane I guess
[1:08:01] <TioXyco> hiding in plain sight
[1:08:01] <%McSnazzyPants> she hides them in the astral plane dummy
[1:08:03] <%Soul_Intern> THERES MANY

[1:08:15] <agumon9000> YEAH BOI LETS FIGHT THE SAME BOSS 5 TIMES IN A ROOOOOOOW
[1:08:16] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat Where you can't see them
[1:08:16] <%gryffinp> WHO'S THAT POKEMON?
[1:08:18] <xcompleasedad> You gotta destroy the people to save the people.
[1:08:22] <%gryffinp> IT'S [Homunculus Delta.]
[1:08:23] <%Solidnick18> alright
[1:08:24] <%Ranryu692> @lewdskeletor13 I just read the last issue of Spider-Man Life Story yesterday. I cried super hard. Zdarsky is amazing

[1:08:49] <%doc_ock_rokc> Maybe director Trench has some insight into this
[1:08:50] <jorniev> mundus from DOntes adventures!?
[1:08:51] <hassanico1> !uptime
[1:08:51] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 8m.
[1:08:52] <starlitalpha> alpha is okay
[1:08:52] <@lewdskeletor13> @ranryu692 For sure. Best series of the year so far. Chip is on fire atm
[1:08:55] <UnfilteredComic> Omega is best
[1:08:56] <%Soul_Intern> AXE BEEFY BOI
[1:09:00] <KitsuneManami> Oh.........
[1:09:02] <%Louie_Salmon> Eh that seems okay

[1:09:08] <%Solidnick18> LUL
[1:09:08] <Sphincter_Spelunker> @Dakuu75 the script has less to be voiced?
[1:09:09] <%SilvaChariot0133> LUL
[1:09:11] <+Jonesman64> HOW ARE YOU NOT USING OMEGA?
[1:09:12] <+HyperCharge_Sam> I feel like Super Armor just makes you die super fast in this game
[1:09:12] <%gryffinp> You underestimate Pat's farming
[1:09:20] <%doc_ock_rokc> ded
[1:09:20] <%McSnazzyPants> @KitsuneManami that's not a unique skill, also you can get omega on a 1-slot chip like i did
[1:09:20] <vVAstrAVv> super armor = big good
[1:09:21] <%TheBitingIrish> What's the max lvl on upgrades?
[1:09:22] <%StaceMcGate> I only equip abilities if the effect spreads Kreygasm Kreygasm
[1:09:23] <%skizzuto> super armor is good because damage doesn't matter for rankings, so it lets you go all out
[1:09:24] <WanderingSwordsman> its the thought that counts
[1:09:25] <%KrimsonKyle> KrimsonKyle subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months! I hope you have been doing well.
[1:09:26] <agumon9000> @AngriestPat Do you want tips on the boss since there is some shit you will not get
[1:09:39] <%pilgrimsayswhat> This OST track is.... disappointing
[1:09:44] <%TheBitingIrish> @AngriestPat Where did you farm for gene code/abilities/etc?
[1:09:44] <%MoulesFritz> lol redcop gonna die

[1:10:59] <+Jonesman64> I used arrow legion for this
[1:10:59] <%Solidnick18> axe legion is so slow
[1:11:00] <KitsuneManami> @AngriestPat do the Stinger summon to get him over faster
[1:11:07] <%Ranryu692> bind the arms

[1:11:37] <agumon9000> Congrats you beat it without it doing its bullshit attack for a second time
[1:11:37] <UnfilteredComic> Gamers
[1:11:40] <gekizenbu> pat is incredibly huge in level
[1:11:45] <Push_Hardly> Can't wait for someone to beat this game without using the legion.
[1:11:49] <%MoulesFritz> going to space
[1:11:50] <%pilgrimsayswhat> Dumb police hat whole game huh lmao
[1:11:52] <%Louie_Salmon> Nice, a shot from the intro

[1:12:00] <%malacante> Legions Rise Up! oh no......
[1:12:00] <@lewdskeletor13> *Batman Beyond meme*
[1:12:01] <Tony0ni> SHITS FUCKED
[1:12:06] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Push_Hardly I don't think that is possible
[1:12:09] <%Soul_Intern> NO
[1:12:11] <%Soul_Intern> PURPLE IS BAD
[1:12:12] <+BlindingFlash> oh right this thing
[1:12:12] <%StaceMcGate> time for an abortion
[1:12:14] <rosemon5001> digimon 1 transition much
[1:12:14] <%supersugoisenpai1> Beating the final boss without Legions seems impossible
[1:12:15] <%Soul_Intern> PURPLE IS VERY BAD
[1:12:15] <Derkinstacker> Thats where shes hiding them pat.
[1:12:17] <agumon9000> @AngriestPat Btw in that first phase that giant long sweeping laser is completely unblockable/avoidable...unless you hide behind those tiny rock pillars that were off to the side.
[1:12:18] <%bevyrage> @Push_Hardly that's not going to happen because you're hard locked to use legions during most fights
[1:12:19] <+nekodelic> @push_hardly Astral Chain speedrun no legion %
[1:12:19] <%PROUD2beGINGER> EGG
[1:12:22] <%d00msdaydan> alright, clear out that hiss and cleanse the OOP

[1:12:33] <KitsuneManami> Purple
[1:12:37] <+AXL808> NO! It's BLUE!
[1:12:37] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Jenna's not wrong there.
[1:12:38] <%reonome> thats what she said
[1:12:38] <%gryffinp> It's really not clear what the fuck Jena's plan is

[1:14:04] <+Clik404> I think Jena is just kinda fucking insane, she’s like half chimera and got stuck in the Astral Plane for 20 years, so her speaking a buncha bullshit kinda makes sense

[1:14:07] <+Jonesman64> yeah
[1:14:08] <anuchallengertwitch> inb4 Chimeras are just humans in the Astral Plane
[1:14:08] <%hazzy_o7> kill them all
[1:14:10] <+Evitron1> ostensibly jena is right. all we know is that her creations eat chimeras and framerate dimension, which helps solve that problem

[1:17:25] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat That so clearly NOT an Axe LUL
[1:17:25] <%Solidnick18> wait
[1:17:27] <%ArcanumMBD> sending axe out at an enemy hovering over the edge is hilarious. He just dunks himself off the level

[1:18:05] <jubejube56> It is an axe in the same way that a switch axe isn’t a charge blade
[1:18:07] <%Soul_Intern> apatBig True
[1:18:07] <%Solidnick18> yeah their was a chest
[1:18:09] <%PROUD2beGINGER> You can still jank the secret if you have a chain extend
[1:18:15] <%ArcanumMBD> if you have + chain range you can jump to that
[1:18:17] <%supersugoisenpai1> Come back for it on the replay
[1:18:17] <%Solidnick18> you can do that to
[1:18:20] <+BlindingFlash> equip a 3 meeter abality and u can make it
[1:18:20] <%Solidnick18> it works
[1:18:23] <%McSnazzyPants> that's probably reachable with stacked chain length mods
[1:18:23] <%Solidnick18> i tried it
[1:18:24] <ultimate_joker_main> tried to cheese it huggCheese

[1:20:13] <+HyperCharge_Sam> the push blocks detonate along with the Axe Legion blocks
[1:20:14] <joeinky> you put it there then blow up the block
[1:20:15] <%ToadKing> you were supposed to move it before detonating
[1:20:15] <%corinv> Wuh oh I got a spambot pm

[1:20:16] <%Shadicara> Forever being ghosted to victory by chat Kappa
[1:20:22] <+Jonesman64> You were supposed to do that before blowing up one of the axe blocks
[1:20:22] <%supersugoisenpai1> Blows up adjacent blocks
[1:20:24] <%PROUD2beGINGER> Time to hack pillar
[1:20:25] <%skizzuto> if you hadn't blown up that thing earlier pushing that block there would have completed the chain and allowed all of those to detonate too
[1:20:33] <hassanico1> how do you manage to not understand that...

[1:23:01] <%NeroInfinite> The camera is a bit pants yeah
[1:23:09] <%FirearmsInstructor> @ミュウレ4242 Seriously. I was thinking that too. All these alternate dimensions looks like bismuth or black salt chunks.

[1:38:26] <+Clik404> @angriestpat I find it kinda interesting that Jena says you’ve already seen all the shit that’s going down, meaning your character is following Yoseph anyway, even though he actually apparently killed your parents
[1:38:27] <%skizzuto> they sure are giving you a lot of extra lives

[1:39:11] <KitsuneManami> @AngriestPat Your Legion only gets pissy if you mess up the Cleaning
[1:39:13] <UnfilteredComic> Nah axe is dirty

[1:39:40] <+Clik404> THE GOOD OL DAYS AFTER
[1:39:41] <+RootVeggie> I read a post that says cleaning actually affects their speed or auto attack rate
[1:39:41] <%1matheuw> THE GOOD OLD DAYS
[1:39:41] <%McSnazzyPants> @HyperCharge_Sam affects how often they attack on their own, which is kinda useful but not really later on
[1:39:41] <%GeneralSCPatton> BECOME AS 「STANDS」
[1:39:43] <%skizzuto> the more you use 'em, the dirtier they get

[1:39:53] <%BestTeaMaker> yes it does, it affects how often they auto attack
[1:39:55] <+Jonesman64> all that jena sex goop on axe
[1:39:59] <%StaceMcGate> @thefishofwar its theorized dirty legions have slow attack speed
[1:40:03] <%hazzy_o7> I can't tell if the game actually wants to trick you that this is the end

[1:41:15] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat It would be great if there's a legit hidden timer and you just game over right now because you're dicking around instead of trying to catch up. :P
[1:41:16] <agumon9000> You can complete Arm Boi

[2:06:08] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat Well you're a Legion now and your Core is still intact so...no?
[2:06:10] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> btw, Pat, you know the code for the locked files, right?
[2:06:16] <8_Bit_Badger> This government seems open and fair
[2:06:21] <%StaceMcGate> Astral Chain Ending [A]
[2:06:32] <%McSnazzyPants> [a]stral chain
[2:06:33] <starlitalpha> file password is 1125 if you dont know it yet pat
[2:06:36] <LeeOhX> wait how can there possible be more
[2:06:39] <+SolverCODO> [A]stral chain
[2:06:41] <Cranky_Construct> he scrolled by them without prompts
[2:06:43] <+Jonesman64> union totally just found out.. for reals yo
[2:06:44] <AllenDeadman> oh so they already made chimeras public
[2:06:45] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> The Twins B-Day
[2:06:45] <%floralkami> WAIT, SO THERE ARE OTHER POPULATIONS
[2:06:49] <Cranky_Construct> so he already opened them up i bet
[2:06:52] <%Lazyallaround> So where's Mundus
[2:06:53] <Sphincter_Spelunker> @VJdarkworld he doesn't know how long the last two files are. people are saying there's should be 1 more stream
[2:06:57] <%bevyrage> there's other populations in the same city
[2:07:01] <Zelluluus> I really hope he gets to hear Dark Hero tonight
[2:07:09] <KitsuneManami> HES LIES
[2:07:11] <%Dakuu75> Soldier 1st Class
[2:07:17] <KoryMccool> dark hero op
[2:07:18] <+HyperCharge_Sam> file 10 is SUPER LONG
[2:07:18] <+Darren716> Both the final chapters are super long
[2:07:18] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> oh he hasnt
[2:07:18] <%bevyrage> remember that we have the slums and middle class locations
[2:07:19] <Cranky_Construct> oh no there it is
[2:07:20] <starlitalpha> 1125
[2:07:20] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> 1125
[2:07:23] <%SergeantSov> I will point out: Humans can't see chimeras, but in our first case humans very much saw the GIANT HAND of the chimera dragging people into the gate
[2:07:26] <+Jonesman64> the last 2 files are actually kind of long
[2:07:27] <%StaceMcGate> Don't believe Ondore's lies!
[2:07:28] <+Darren716> 10 in particular has so much side stuff
[2:07:30] <%McSnazzyPants> he did that already in file 6 he knows
[2:07:35] <+Darren716> Its great though
[2:07:36] <%marsanta> 1125
[2:07:36] <%Laecerelius> Pretty sure he already read the locked ones
[2:07:36] <AllenDeadman> pat do you want the codes for those?
[2:07:37] <%shadowace2400> did you notice anything OFF about the ravens?
[2:07:37] <%dekkitout> Red Cop: Red Case

[2:07:42] <VJdarkworld> @Sphincter_Spelunker yeh im assuming another stream
[2:07:42] <%malacante> they can see like whispy shadows of chimeras, like you could in the first mission
[2:07:43] <Cranky_Construct> oh does it relock then during this intermission?
[2:07:48] <Mendin> He alrady read the codelocked ones
[2:07:48] <8_Bit_Badger> This is pat announcing his employment with audible
[2:07:51] <KoryMccool> whats the longest file been so far?
[2:07:54] <KoryMccool> and hoiw long
[2:07:55] <%snow_bush> Raven always makes me think of Armored Core 2
[2:07:56] <%McSnazzyPants> @Cranky_Construct yeah, for some reason
[2:07:57] <starlitalpha> no, he was in the ark files, those arent locked
[2:08:02] <%FirearmsInstructor> Why is everyone saying 1125??
[2:08:03] <Cranky_Construct> That's odd
[2:08:04] <haisho> aren't those...your accomplishments?

[2:16:40] <%CrypticMochi> A bee
[2:16:40] <LandOfTheWay> @purple_bagel 10
[2:16:40] <%dukenux> Its a spider
[2:16:42] <8_Bit_Badger> I think she almost choked on mustard honestly
[2:16:45] <purple_bagel> Oh fuck i love this chapter
[2:16:46] <+heroicspiritavenger> It’s probably that she ran out of mustard
[2:16:46] <%BioApple> "house centipede" is a bad term because it implies those fuckers belong anywhere near MY turf
[2:16:49] <%NeroInfinite> 5
[2:16:50] <Sphincter_Spelunker> @dekkitout I don't like that. I don't like that at all
[2:16:51] <@lewdskeletor13> Maybe she broke another door
[2:16:56] <LeeOhX> I like the hasty rise to action Pat just did
[2:17:03] <%Nina96> she broke the house
[2:17:07] <8_Bit_Badger> Maybe she ate poison AGAIN
[2:17:13] <%Monkeyweed21> she broke her eyeballs
[2:17:14] <%dekkitout> Though a centibee would probably resemble a hawk wasp
[2:17:19] <%doc_ock_rokc> maybe elmo killed a bug and gave it to her
[2:17:21] <%StaceMcGate> Pat will fend off the burglar with axe legion and parrying
[2:17:24] <@lewdskeletor13> Stop eating glass Paige!
[2:17:25] <%Shadicara> Pat comes back covered in blood and piss
[2:17:25] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Is a centibee a bee with a hundred stingers?

[2:17:39] <%doc_ock_rokc> @King_Wolf_Rigger no and yes

[2:18:00] <%doc_ock_rokc> Its fine
[2:18:03] <+Jonesman64> *sweating intensifies*
[2:18:04] <8_Bit_Badger> We're gonna look like assholes if they both get murdered by a robber and we were just joking here about it
[2:18:05] <%Meekest> It'll be fine, worst comes to worst we have Elmo
[2:18:06] <KoryMccool> dont worry guys... its just elmo revolting to overthrow the home
[2:18:15] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> I know that a beepede is a bee with a hundred legs.
[2:18:15] <%StaceMcGate> Elmo will survive in the end
[2:18:17] <%Soul_Intern> @8_Bit_Badger Dark
[2:18:21] <LeeOhX> its fine she probably fell down some stairs
[2:18:23] <%Shadicara> apatBlep
[2:18:27] <%dekkitout> Well, when a daddy bee and a mommy centipede make baby centibees, all but 1 of the babies die to cannibalism...
[2:18:35] <+heroicspiritavenger> A centibee would be a flying centipede with small wings that somehow make it fly and it has two stingers on it’s end. It retains all the legs and huge front mandibles. It also doesn’t produce honey because it only exists to be an asshole.

[2:26:43] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat you also have empty ability slots on beast
[2:26:43] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @doc_ock_rokc That's good. I know that the BR causes your flesh to disintigrate and that's just fuckin terrifying hahaha.
[2:26:47] <ChaoticDaKiller> doesn't always work on some exceptionally large enemies tho
[2:26:48] <cassiecagedd> GRAVITY SNEEZE

[2:26:57] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> left one on Sword is a new skill
[2:26:59] <iaraCatunda> but is it beast?
[2:27:00] <Caidezes> No. It's a beast skill.
[2:27:04] <blackorchidKI2> YOU ARE DEFEATED
[2:27:04] <cassiecagedd> sword feels unloved
[2:27:09] <jubejube56> It’s just an ability slot
[2:27:12] <al0nem0nster> sword is unloved.

[2:27:30] <WanderingSwordsman> triple swords ain't great
[2:27:31] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> Sword Skill
[2:27:35] <%doc_ock_rokc> @King_Wolf_Rigger yeah there is a reason we take small spiders more seriously down here. if a BR venom sinks into the skin to long only cutting out the section would stop it
[2:27:36] <%Soul_Intern> maow
[2:27:50] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat you should delete mods you'll never use
[2:27:57] <%InugamiTheHound> apatGib xcalLove
[2:28:02] <%Louie_Salmon> @stacemcgate What if he needs it later
[2:28:10] <%BioApple> @StaceMcGate but apatGoblin apatGoblin apatGoblin
[2:28:11] <%dekkitout> Throw on a sick pair of shades?
[2:28:13] <%mayorrev> GOBLINS ACTIVATED

[2:28:13] <iaraCatunda> what if he need it
[2:28:14] <%VantomPayne> apatGoblin apatGoblin apatGoblin apatGoblin apatGoblin
[2:28:15] <%StaceMcGate> if it doesn't have an added effect its trash
[2:28:15] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> plus it's not like you get anything for deleting them
[2:28:19] <%Monkeyweed21> Speed for doggo
[2:28:21] <%Ion_Laser> apatGoblin apatGoblin apatGoblin
[2:28:23] <xcompleasedad> Because you already have 30 copies of them?
[2:28:27] <8_Bit_Badger> Did someone just ask pat to part ways with an item in a videogame
[2:28:31] <%BoboDaHobo> you won't use them if you delete them
[2:28:34] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> Sword
[2:28:34] <purple_bagel> You can find more of the same mods, they’re not finite
[2:28:37] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @doc_ock_rokc Where you at in the world if you don't mind me asking? I'm in the Pacific Northwest, so we got BRs more common than the BWs.
[2:28:37] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> or Arrow
[2:28:38] <%Monkeyweed21> Sword
[2:28:42] <%Louie_Salmon> @stacemcgate But what if he uses an added affect one, and then wants another copy of that same ability?
[2:28:44] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> left one
[2:28:44] <vVAstrAVv> stop ignoring the mechanic
[2:28:57] <%StaceMcGate> @Louie_Salmon apatGoblin
[2:29:01] <vVAstrAVv> just look for 3 minutes
[2:29:03] <TeethandHunger> save them all. You have to save them all.
[2:29:05] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> the left one is a new skill
[2:29:06] <gustavozxd> LUL
[2:29:08] <al0nem0nster> welp too late, apparently left was skill
[2:29:13] <WanderingSwordsman> @AngriestPat get the middle skill for arrow
[2:29:25] <%hawk_rush> LUL
[2:29:31] <%1matheuw> why you have autp-bind in all of them?
[2:29:36] <%Louie_Salmon> @stacemcgate It's called redundancy sweetheart, look it up
[2:29:43] <Ciriliko> evoMindBlown evo19Rekt
[2:29:45] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> middle for Arrow, left for Sword
[2:29:51] <al0nem0nster> they just mean those upgrade chips.
[2:29:52] <%Monkeyweed21> abilities
[2:29:54] <al0nem0nster> probably
[2:29:57] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Give him a sec he might be typing it out.
[2:29:57] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> I'm a mechanic, don't ignore me.
[2:30:01] <%StaceMcGate> good thing there are 20 sidequests in this chapter to get some material
[2:30:05] <Saltmeisterr> lol dude just peaced out
[2:30:08] <%NeroInfinite> the fact that ikeeps the stats for the others
[2:30:08] <transporterthesequel> I have no idea what he's talking about
[2:30:08] <%Monkeyweed21> you can get crazy shit like sync heal or parry
[2:30:09] <vVAstrAVv> abilities theres not that many youre just seeing all the variations and running
[2:30:13] <gustavozxd> I'm curious to know about this mechanic
[2:30:16] <purple_bagel> You should grind so that you can steamroll the final boss and have it be anticlimactic
[2:30:17] <Tha_Mik> ju don't ignore it
[2:30:20] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> I think the guy is getting ahead of himself.
[2:30:20] <%InugamiTheHound> @King_Wolf_Rigger hello, <3 xcalLove
[2:30:23] <%Dakuu75> be more vague chat. don't explain a fucking thing.
[2:30:25] <%doc_ock_rokc> @King_Wolf_Rigger North texas area its not uncommon to run into BRs and BWs in sheds
[2:30:26] <xcompleasedad> ????
[2:30:30] <transporterthesequel> ....okay!?
[2:30:33] <transporterthesequel> ONE GUY
[2:30:37] <Saltmeisterr> WHAT
[2:30:40] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @InugamiTheHound Howdy!
[2:30:44] <%BioApple> were those all just attack uos
[2:30:45] <vVAstrAVv> all attack doesn't count lol
[2:30:46] <SleepyMaribo> some abilites have extra effects and your jsut equiping the worst ones
[2:30:47] <DSD24> The Dandiest of Men
[2:30:48] <%42nfl19> IS THAT MISSING DOGGO?
[2:30:49] <%Louie_Salmon> But that's the problem, that there's a bunch of variations and they're all different
[2:30:52] <Phoenon> Probably means the plus sign effects
[2:30:52] <%Monkeyweed21> they mean things that actually do something like parry or legion rush
[2:30:59] <%StaceMcGate> I think the guy meant he wasn't looking at the added effects of each one
[2:31:01] <%BioApple> at least get the fucking moon of mahaa-kalaa one
[2:31:02] <%redrins> play the game MY WAY
[2:31:03] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> ignore them Pat. Play however you want.
[2:31:04] <%doc_ock_rokc> I'm gonna sell this cop Grenades
[2:31:05] <jubejube56> Is triple sword spam the quickest way to build trigger gauge?
[2:31:07] <%FirearmsInstructor> @vVAstrAVv Can you elaborate further? What are you trying to suggest or say?
[2:31:07] <iaraCatunda> a
[2:31:09] <vVAstrAVv> btw you left your chain length on axe legion i think
[2:31:09] <%supersugoisenpai1> Pat likes big damage
[2:31:09] <%Monkeyweed21> beacause it means you are a basic bithc
[2:31:11] <transporterthesequel> @vVAstrAVv Dude what specifically are you talking about?
[2:31:19] <WanderingSwordsman> oh yea, there's a hidden shop in file 3
[2:31:19] <Cranky_Construct> I mean, i'd spam attack mods too if I had that many
[2:31:21] <purple_bagel> I just learned that this game has ukemis and I’m intimidated
[2:31:23] <%rumtumtugnutz> That guy lookedlike a hobo Pat Howard
[2:31:25] <transporterthesequel> What did he do that you think was wrong?
[2:31:25] <%InugamiTheHound> @King_Wolf_Rigger apatDab xcalDab
[2:31:26] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @doc_ock_rokc Yeah, sheds are havens for the little bastards. I have to clean the garage frequently to keep them from settling in.
[2:31:27] <%doc_ock_rokc> man that guy looks good in his cop cosplay
[2:31:32] <KitsuneManami> @AngriestPat New Guilty Gear Info Soon!
[2:31:35] <darkdagon769> not sure I wanna watch a stream where pat just looks at abilities and not play the game for 45 mins
[2:31:35] <Sonicdy> im pretty sure the missing doggo is legion now
[2:31:37] <%StaceMcGate> CATEPILLERS
[2:31:40] <%Louie_Salmon> This is definitely a "one dude" situation
[2:31:40] <iaraCatunda> all attack, big strong
[2:31:47] <Ciriliko> TehePelo
[2:31:48] <%malacante> I stopped paying attention to abilities at like file 9 and I was fine at a way lower level than pat
[2:31:49] <+Dorf1> i think he means the randomized elements of the abilities like the parry
[2:31:53] <Huntercd> Is Paige okay?
[2:31:53] <Sphincter_Spelunker> A dick in a box is a good present for a stranger
[2:31:54] <%doc_ock_rokc> @King_Wolf_Rigger I just bomb garages and sheds before going in
[2:31:56] <+Caped_Eggy> Take her yourself
[2:32:06] <+darquezsmith> Just ingnore them
[2:32:07] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @doc_ock_rokc lol good plan
[2:32:08] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat talk to npcs to find out gift ideas
[2:32:09] <hassanico1> @Louie_Salmon nah, Pat is severely not engaging with the abilities
[2:32:10] <%Monkeyweed21> because it means you're a basic bitch
[2:32:11] <%dukenux> just give her the D-r Pepper
[2:32:17] <Sphincter_Spelunker> @Huntercd she's fine. it was a spider she was yelling about
[2:32:18] <%pilgrimsayswhat> Pat just play the game how you want, literally just ignore that
[2:32:20] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> yeah, I getchu.
[2:32:22] <%dekkitout> Weird flex, but okay
[2:32:24] <%dukenux> everyone likes Dr Pepper
[2:32:25] <TeethandHunger> To be fair hes been getting S ranks with what he has on now
[2:32:25] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @InugamiTheHound How's the day finding you?
[2:32:27] <KitsuneManami> @AngriestPat Guilty Gear News INC
[2:32:28] <doggieo> Effect Spread ability will help ith that
[2:32:29] <%malacante> I kinda wish you could set one ability set for all your legions
[2:32:30] <Ciriliko> tpKyawawa
[2:32:31] <+Dorf1> there is an ability for that i forgot what it is called
[2:32:35] <%1matheuw> can you devil trigger pat?
[2:32:36] <%NeroInfinite> yeah you can just ignore the abilities at this point tbh
[2:32:41] <%McSnazzyPants> i mean that's half your ability slots locked off for auto bind of all things, but you do you
[2:32:44] <Phoenon> Now this is an important case
[2:32:47] <%rumtumtugnutz> Giver that blend of 23 flavors that is the Dr Penis
[2:32:49] <%BioApple> super armor's real good tho
[2:32:50] <+Jonesman64> talk to many people
[2:32:56] <%StaceMcGate> Caterpillars!
[2:32:59] <%InugamiTheHound> @King_Wolf_Rigger good, I finally bought capture card, so I can finally sit down and learn how to stream on twitch.
[2:33:03] <+Caped_Eggy> Gross her out
[2:33:05] <%Laecerelius> gross bugs! Girls love those!
[2:33:06] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Caterpillars are weird.
[2:33:07] <purple_bagel> Do what jena didnt and JUST TALK
[2:33:07] <DSD24> Get her a Caterpie
[2:33:08] <cassiecagedd> trust the "grabbing man"
[2:33:08] <Sonicdy> LUL LUL
[2:33:12] <Phoenon> Tell him she likes caterpillars Kappa
[2:33:13] <Cranky_Construct> Auto-bind's stupid good yeah
[2:33:15] <Idon__> Yeah but for... everyone?
[2:33:15] <%42nfl19> did that woman just dab?
[2:33:16] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Misty loved Caterpie
[2:33:17] <%Monkeyweed21> you only need it on one legion tho
[2:33:19] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> bonus points for multi-bind.
[2:33:21] <%1matheuw> isnt better to use it on just one?
[2:33:23] <GeltonZ> Caterpillars are hella cute
[2:33:26] <vVAstrAVv> autobind is good as heck lol
[2:33:27] <%McSnazzyPants> i just bind manually and it's find
[2:33:29] <jubejube56> I'd suggest at least going for speed star on Axe legion
[2:33:30] <Cranky_Construct> I mean if you only have it on one you gotta keep switching
[2:33:33] <Cranky_Construct> and that can be a pain
[2:33:34] <%42nfl19> chat with everyone?
[2:33:35] <%SilvaChariot0133> It's good until the boss you're fighting reists it
[2:33:42] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @InugamiTheHound Sweet deal. Been thinking about something similar.
[2:33:43] <%rumtumtugnutz> That guy wanted to fondle your X-Baton
[2:33:46] <%1matheuw> is not like you catn switch legions on the fly
[2:33:46] <%Monkeyweed21> so you can use stuff like speed star and hit rush
[2:33:48] <al0nem0nster> guess the chat just prefers variation
[2:33:49] <%McSnazzyPants> i find it far more useful to have a variety of skills
[2:33:51] <transporterthesequel> Yeah but it's two instances of free damage
[2:33:54] <%McSnazzyPants> just bind manually
[2:33:55] <%thefishofwar> Hey Pat, what do you think about speedstar on axe legion?
[2:33:56] <%BioApple> i have autobind on sword and the range seems super limited
[2:33:57] <%Monkeyweed21> switching is INSTANT
[2:34:02] <Idon__> Like, what about the cooler shit
[2:34:06] <%1matheuw> thats fine
[2:34:09] <hassanico1> And switching Legions is an issue because?
[2:34:09] <%Louie_Salmon> @monkeyweed21 Not if you're in the middle of a combo
[2:34:10] <+Jonesman64> hal has a sugesstion
[2:34:10] <%SilvaChariot0133> NotLikeThis
[2:34:11] <%malacante> Well if you're playing optimally, you should put autobing on everyone, then when it stales, you open the pause menu and switch it out
[2:34:11] <%pilgrimsayswhat> Yeah ask this weirdo instead of Olive herself LMAO
[2:34:11] <%Big_Dream> Mind goblins
[2:34:13] <Zelluluus> Hit rush is too good for allowing multiple legions on the field though
[2:34:15] <%DeathsDoom> FILE 12 OUCH
[2:34:15] <%malacante> the real pro strats
[2:34:15] <Tha_Mik> No Pat do it MY way
[2:34:15] <%InugamiTheHound> apatGoblin apatGoblin apatGoblin
[2:34:16] <%SilvaChariot0133> apatGoblin
[2:34:16] <Saltmeisterr> what evs pat
[2:34:17] <%worldbrand> chat, stop trying to un-crazy pat
[2:34:17] <pwnhills> oh god
[2:34:18] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat Hal is the last
[2:34:19] <%supersugoisenpai1> Don't try to argue with Pat, nobody wins
[2:34:20] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Isn't switching a legion like style switching?
[2:34:22] <al0nem0nster> you aren't minmaxing enough Pat
[2:34:24] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> You're a goddamn poet, Pat.
[2:34:25] <iaraCatunda> is there an ability to auto focus when doing slash/zandatsu????
[2:34:28] <%joylent_blue> let him play how he wants jesus christ
[2:34:32] <pwnhills> please stop this immediately
[2:34:33] <%rumtumtugnutz> You guys can always just go and play the game yourselves instead of telling Pat he's playing it wrong.
[2:34:34] <al0nem0nster> must Minmax for da chat
[2:34:35] <%Monkeyweed21> you mean like DIFFERENT ABILITIES
[2:34:37] <%BoboDaHobo> But Pat, play the game the way I did
[2:34:37] <%ToadKing> NO PAT PLAY _MY_ WAY
[2:34:38] <Caidezes> Just play the game "perfectly".
[2:34:38] <%king_wragles> Let the weird man play his game
[2:34:39] <Strider222> yeah just play
[2:34:41] <%VantomPayne> stop giving pat opportunities to be pat
[2:34:41] <+Darren716> How are you getting S+s again?

[2:34:47] <+badbloodbear> Hey pat any plans for Greedfall
[2:34:49] <%McSnazzyPants> just play it exactly like i do and this wouldn't be a problem
[2:34:49] <VorpalFork> Jesus Christ just let Pat play the game the way he wants
[2:34:50] <Idon__> Get her a girlfriend, she'll love that.
[2:34:50] <%dekkitout> Second game with big boy style scoring can't come fast enough tajC
[2:34:51] <vVAstrAVv> pat do you only use one weapon in bayonetta
[2:34:52] <%GeneralSCPatton> BABY LEVEL: BEYOND INFINITE
[2:34:54] <%brickwall35> @rumtumtugnutz bruh don't White Knight for Pat
[2:34:59] <%Monkeyweed21> Let Pat be a basic bitch
[2:34:59] <hassanico1> Oh boy here comes the overdefensive baby squad
[2:35:00] <%floralkami> Can y'all let Pat play how he wants? If y'all want to play the game like that, go get the game.
[2:35:00] <Cranky_Construct> You get S+ ranks by doing sync attacks, backstabs, and varied legion use typically
[2:35:01] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat BUT PAT I THINK YOU SHOULD PLAY THIS WAY AND WHY AREN'T YOU PLAYING THE WAY I WANT YOU TO PLAY BECAUSE REASONS DO IT MY WAY!!! D:<<<
[2:35:04] <Sonicdy> pat want to cheat Chat
[2:35:06] <iaraCatunda> Olive is in love with Brenda
[2:35:10] <Tony0ni> stop your making pat stronger
[2:35:11] <Cranky_Construct> It gets easier to do the further in you get with your character progression
[2:35:12] <%SilvaChariot0133> WHY ARE WE YELLING
[2:35:12] <+rogoho> you guys are arguing with a crazy person
[2:35:13] <FalseEyeD> GreedFall is 100% EuroJank
[2:35:15] <DSD24> Greedfall's pretty fun
[2:35:16] <%1matheuw> i thought he just didnt notice that he had it on every legion
[2:35:19] <%rumtumtugnutz> @brickwall35 Are you serious? Cause if you are, you're a fucking idiot.
[2:35:20] <%Big_Dream> to be fair we always give pat a hard time so you white knights can chill
[2:35:20] <%InugamiTheHound> if that bitch a bag full of ice cream and bugs an flowers
[2:35:21] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> LOUD NOISES!
[2:35:23] <TeethandHunger> pat dosn't want to cure cancer, he wants to turn people into Leagons
[2:35:25] <hassanico1> You people are fucking lunatics
[2:35:25] <WanderingSwordsman> save back seating for when he dies
[2:35:27] <DSD24> @FalseEyeD It actually runs pretty well
[2:35:32] <Sphincter_Spelunker> @rumtumtugnutz calm down, dude
[2:35:34] <%42nfl19> Wait maybe the vending machine as a gift idea...SODA
[2:35:34] <Phoenon> SourPls
[2:35:34] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat hal is the last npc
[2:35:35] <%malacante> if he dies
[2:35:35] <Archmortal> did someone just suggest auto-bind is cheating? Lmfao
[2:35:36] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> And for using all your x-baton modes, don't forget that
[2:35:43] <al0nem0nster> NOw to be fair, It's all fine to play a game the way you want, up until they start complaining about a game, because of the stupid way their playing. As of yet this has not happened with Pat so he's fine playing however he wants.
[2:35:46] <FalseEyeD> @DSD24 Talking more about controls and animation, really
[2:35:48] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> more pts towards the evaluation
[2:35:48] <Phoenon> Don't think there's a single bad song on this OST
[2:35:49] <%Louie_Salmon> @vvastravv Of course, you equip the best weapons and use that
[2:35:50] <%rumtumtugnutz> Whatever.
[2:35:52] <%brickwall35> @rumtumtugnutz oof ouch big insult
[2:35:58] <UnfilteredComic> ARM -> Grav Storm -> Auto Bind -> BEAST -> Howl -> Hit Rush -> AXE -> Sync Attack -> Crash Bomb is my go-to late game combo
[2:35:59] <%malacante> I went with the diet drinks
[2:36:00] <+HyperCharge_Sam> LUL
[2:36:00] <Sphincter_Spelunker> @brickwall35 knock it off
[2:36:01] <%StaceMcGate> Caterpillars is true answer
[2:36:02] <cassiecagedd> Hal wouldnt know girls
[2:36:04] <+Darren716> Do the diet drink one
[2:36:04] <transporterthesequel> Hal is BAD AT THIS

[2:36:09] <Cranky_Construct> Hal that sounds like an insult
[2:36:09] <haisho> wow Hal
[2:36:09] <%InugamiTheHound> he saying that she's fat LOL slim fast for the bitches
[2:36:11] <ShichiNoBushi> "Here. I think you're fat."
[2:36:11] <%SilvaChariot0133> That's suicide LUL
[2:36:11] <%dekkitout> Hal's lowkey dissing her LUL
[2:36:12] <+Darren716> This dude is a schlub
[2:36:12] <%doc_ock_rokc> Hal would die
[2:36:13] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Hal... bud....
[2:36:14] <%McSnazzyPants> bless you hal
[2:36:14] <Phoenon> I got Otacon vibes as soon as I saw this guy, then I see his name's Hal
[2:36:15] <+HyperCharge_Sam> drink this diet drink fatty LUL
[2:36:15] <%Reaviar> that sounds like it would backfire hard
[2:36:16] <%mrgrimsmiles> the only bad thing about this thats not better than the police station is.... there is no lappy
[2:36:19] <+Darren716> Olive deserves better
[2:36:19] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Diet drinks and caterpillars are totes wrong. I would know. I have talked to a girl or two in my time.
[2:36:20] <%doc_ock_rokc> This isn't hal emeric
[2:36:21] <%worldbrand> I totally went with bugs
[2:36:24] <+Darren716> Than this jackass
[2:36:24] <%BioApple> hal, master saboteur
[2:36:25] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Bugs
[2:36:25] <%StaceMcGate> Caterpillars
[2:36:26] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Aren't you like, GOLD+ S+ rank?? I'm guessing your setup is working just fine...
[2:36:26] <hassanico1> Give her Catterpliallrs
[2:36:27] <%StaceMcGate> nooo
[2:36:27] <%Big_Dream> nope
[2:36:31] <%NeroInfinite> nope
[2:36:31] <gustavozxd> the problem with someone playing is when someone is playing it wrong, and is blaming the game as if it's not their fault for failing
[2:36:32] <+Darren716> Boo
[2:36:33] <purple_bagel> CATERPILLARS
[2:36:35] <+Jonesman64> cam confirm she didnt like bag actually
[2:36:35] <%malacante> my lategame combo was use oraoraora over and over because it has super armour and you have a million lives
[2:36:36] <Phoenon> MY LOVE
[2:36:37] <SlimeSlimeSlime> GIrls like bugs!
[2:36:39] <%Futurecity10> @AngriestPat If you saw flowers, he gives her weeds.
[2:36:40] <DSD24> @FalseEyeD Oh ok I get you, but most eurojank games run poorly so I was surprised that Greedfall runs well
[2:36:41] <%worldbrand> What if she already has one
[2:36:42] <%Big_Dream> qrong
[2:36:47] <%StaceMcGate> REJECTED
[2:36:47] <%Soul_Intern> WRONG
[2:36:50] <%Big_Dream> wrong
[2:36:50] <%Soul_Intern> BAD END
[2:36:50] <Phoenon> RESET
[2:36:51] <powerprotoman> man pat is bad with women
[2:36:51] <%McSnazzyPants> the flowers one was hilarious
[2:36:52] <+ToiletTrees> so does anyone know when bl3 will come out ofr steam? i know its timed but how long we gotta wait?
[2:36:54] <%SilvaChariot0133> F
[2:36:55] <SlimeSlimeSlime> GET DUNKED ON!
[2:36:56] <ALazo> If you try to give her flowers, he finds weeds and gives them to her
[2:36:57] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Buy the women stuff then they love you
[2:36:59] <iaraCatunda> she's gay and in love with Brenda
[2:36:59] <%worldbrand> That was a really soft landing
[2:37:03] <%totesmcgoat_> Save scum
[2:37:05] <%rumtumtugnutz> @Toilet April
[2:37:08] <SleepyMaribo> @McSnazzyPants next year
[2:37:09] <%Starlight_Gamer> is there a right answer for that?
[2:37:09] <Tha_Mik> It was the drink all along
[2:37:12] <Strider222> the flower option is funny
[2:37:12] <purple_bagel> Caterpillars make her flip her absolute fuck
[2:37:13] <%Monkeyweed21> find a toilet
[2:37:13] <+ToiletTrees> oof
[2:37:14] <+Jonesman64> file restarrrr
[2:37:20] <DSD24> @iaraCatunda She didn't say she lover her like that though
[2:37:21] <hassanico1> She wanted the Catterpillars
[2:37:23] <%CherrieVelvet> she already has a best friend
[2:37:30] <%NeroInfinite> air shot not great
[2:37:30] <powerprotoman> hit rush si the cool shit tho
[2:37:30] <+HyperCharge_Sam> you get a better skill at the end of the skill tree
[2:37:35] <%McSnazzyPants> air shot is ok if you encircle an enemy since it traces the chain
[2:37:36] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat Arrow has slow arrow in the middle, which is nice
[2:37:36] <Phoenon> Hit Rush is sick on Arrow
[2:37:37] <%BioApple> i started to like air shot once i realized it followed the chain
[2:37:38] <jubejube56> Slow shot on arrow is far better anyways
[2:37:39] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Nice sabotage job! now get in there and give Olive the ol' greasy... nevermind
[2:37:40] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> just move on, Pat.
[2:37:40] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @AngriestPat I think the Beast Legion's Howl does the same as Auto-bind, could be wrong.
[2:37:41] <%Big_Dream> sync keep is really stogn @AngriestPat
[2:37:41] <%McSnazzyPants> slow shot is the real good shit
[2:37:42] <UnfilteredComic> It is, keep it
[2:37:44] <%1matheuw> nothing wrong with it
[2:37:45] <al0nem0nster> I think their reasoning is you have 4 copies of it.
[2:37:46] <vVAstrAVv> @firearmsinstructor thats not a setup thing. your rewards get higher as you level up so it just gets easier to s+ with more upgrades
[2:37:46] <%worldbrand> It's fine, It's literally fine
[2:37:46] <transporterthesequel> Auto bind IS great
[2:37:46] <%FlyingRamen> oh shit we back on this
[2:37:46] <DSD24> Hit Rush on Arrow is pretty good
[2:37:48] <%ToadKing> BECAUSE PAT IT'S NOT WHAT I WAAAAAAAAANT
[2:37:49] <%Monkeyweed21> its not stylish to have it on EVERY Legion
[2:37:51] <%SilvaChariot0133> It IS great, for two uses Kappa
[2:37:51] <joeinky> I straight up ignored that sidequest because olive clearly is into the MC
[2:37:52] <Strider222> JUST PLAY THE GAME MAN
[2:37:53] <ChaoticDaKiller> Howl does what autobind does but way better
[2:37:53] <al0nem0nster> 5 copies*
[2:37:55] <hassanico1> @ToadKing shut up
[2:37:56] <ShichiNoBushi> It just does something fast that you could do yourself.
[2:37:57] <%NeroInfinite> it fucks up combos that lead to bigger damage but you do you
[2:37:58] <%DeathsDoom> Speed star is good for Axe and gladius
[2:38:00] <+BlindingFlash> Not sure how you live without speedstar though
[2:38:02] <vVAstrAVv> pats actually right here guys autobind is great lol
[2:38:06] <Saunt> Why are the ability triangles red on all the legions besides arrow?
[2:38:07] <iaraCatunda> @dsd24 it's joke my dude
[2:38:07] <cassiecagedd> Hand the controller to chat. worked for twitch plays pokemon right? RIGHT?
[2:38:09] <%malacante> If I don't put autobind on all legions I forget which button does what
[2:38:13] <ne0bunny> how dare you like playing the game in a different way than I do!
[2:38:18] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Summon Swords are so cool
[2:38:18] <gustavozxd> just turn the game off, g
[2:38:22] <DSD24> @iaraCatunda My bad
[2:38:24] <%Monkeyweed21> you can use it to have 2 stands
[2:38:24] <%McSnazzyPants> i just use the time pause to actiuvate skills
[2:38:26] <%Kyma1020> It’s great for one legion but not every legion
[2:38:26] <%malacante> that's not me memeing that's forreal
[2:38:27] <jubejube56> I didn't like an ability because I didn't use it
[2:38:28] <+HyperCharge_Sam> hit rush is good to pop out and then you switch to something else
[2:38:29] <purple_bagel> Chat would flip their shit watching me play, i had autobind and attack boost on all of my legions
[2:38:29] <Zelluluus> Hit rush lets you swap to other legions while they stay attacking
[2:38:30] <Phoenon> I like using it on Arrow for constant DPS then just switching Legions
[2:38:32] <iaraCatunda> I hate sync keep!!
[2:38:33] <%totesmcgoat_> Wait, this isn't Destiny 2
[2:38:34] <%McSnazzyPants> wait shit that's not how that works
[2:38:37] <%arancet> auto bind is good, but seems silly to put it on all the legions
[2:38:37] <%worldbrand> I like to use hit rush on everyone
[2:38:38] <gustavozxd> damn I sent the message before I finished typing
[2:38:38] <+Vayatan> hit rush is good for arrow. he makes a good long range distraction
[2:38:43] <%Goobbue> apatGib
[2:38:45] <+HyperCharge_Sam> LONG MISSION
[2:38:46] <+Jonesman64> i never used any of the legion skillls... other than attack up lol
[2:38:48] <SleepyMaribo> @AngriestPat i think people are saying that because binding the same target over and over weakens the bind, enemies will instantly break out after being binded 3 times.
[2:38:48] <%Soul_Intern> big sidequest time
[2:38:49] <%FirearmsInstructor> @vVAstrAVv Honestly I don't know the mechanics or anything. I was just suggesting you explain what you wanted Pat to do in greater detail so he understands and can make a decision. :)
[2:38:50] <al0nem0nster> please get arrested immediately
[2:38:51] <iaraCatunda> I HAte Sync keep
[2:38:51] <%1matheuw> auto bind needs to be its own thing kinda like air hike to be honest
[2:38:52] <ALazo> side mission town
[2:38:53] <vVAstrAVv> PAAAT you left chain length on arrow legion
[2:38:53] <%42nfl19> WHISPER? SPY ON THAT SHIT
[2:38:53] <%SilvaChariot0133> Marathon time
[2:38:54] <Idon__> Yup, it's a sidequest File...
[2:38:56] <%StaceMcGate> so many redcases Kreygasm Kreygasm
[2:38:59] <AwesomeDan_> Pat how the hell do you put up with all the backseaters and spoilers? Would drive me nuts.
[2:39:08] <gustavozxd> turn the game off, and go full screen on the camera and stare at it for 2 hours
[2:39:11] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> dont forget the hidden cases you don't even see, Pat.
[2:39:14] <%worldbrand> This chapter unlocks more sidequests after you clear them all here, as a heads up
[2:39:14] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Question. I was debating buying a Switch. Can I play physical copies without downloading day 1 patches?
[2:39:15] <%DeathsDoom> HMMM
[2:39:19] <%Monkeyweed21> then why on every legion
[2:39:21] <SleepyMaribo> @AngriestPat your good man, i use the same set up lol
[2:39:29] <%pilgrimsayswhat> apatDab
[2:39:30] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @gustavozxd If he did that, too many people would beat off.
[2:39:35] <Disfaceplank> SeriousSloth Just shut them down.
[2:39:37] <%VantomPayne> apatGoblin apatGoblin apatGoblin apatGoblin apatGoblin
[2:39:38] <%Soul_Intern> LUL
[2:39:39] <Phoenon> He likes having it on every legion so he doesn't have to think when he wants to Autobind
[2:39:39] <%SilvaChariot0133> NotLikeThis
[2:39:40] <%BioApple> BUT I DIH IT I IT'S DIFFERENT
[2:39:41] <vVAstrAVv> dab on the backseaters
[2:39:41] <+Estuko> :o
[2:39:42] <%SilvaChariot0133> apatGoblin
[2:39:42] <SleepyMaribo> LOL
[2:39:43] <Gorshum> LUL
[2:39:44] <%brickwall35> @sphincter_spelunker I think you still get stuck with day 1 patches

[2:39:45] <@lewdskeletor13> They are mad hoes
[2:39:46] <rattler123> PAT GANG
[2:39:46] <%pilgrimsayswhat> LUL LUL LUL LUL
[2:39:47] <KoryMccool> LUL
[2:39:48] <%supersugoisenpai1> Pat is playing. Therefore, he is right
[2:39:48] <%rumtumtugnutz> @Sphincter_Spelunker If it needs a patch, it needs a patch. Physical or non physical makes no difference
[2:39:49] <hassanico1> Except that didn't happen
[2:39:50] <transporterthesequel> Right in the Beefers
[2:39:51] <%VantomPayne> goblin will always win
[2:39:51] <%republicofu> LUL
[2:39:51] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Being a shitter to people feels REALLY GOOD
[2:39:53] <Archmortal> You know what? Chat's got the mind goblins with this auto-bind fixation holy shit
[2:39:53] <AwesomeDan_> Oh. yeah i guess that would feel good.
[2:39:53] <%thefishofwar> apatWhat
[2:39:54] <iaraCatunda> Joe's mad
[2:39:54] <%ToadKing> pat's got it all figured out
[2:39:56] <Tha_Mik> But Pat, MY way is better
[2:39:56] <%StaceMcGate> apatDab apatDab apatDab
[2:39:56] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat But Pat... you're W R O N G, according to me. D:<
[2:39:56] <+darquezsmith> or just hang them LUL
[2:40:00] <iaraCatunda> hoes mad
[2:40:00] <hassanico1> Except you're the one who freaked out Pat
[2:40:01] <%Monkeyweed21> Man you are the opposite of woolie
[2:40:03] <%brickwall35> apatDab apatDab apatDab
[2:40:06] <+darquezsmith> Ban I ment ban
[2:40:07] <%VantomPayne> PAT WILL FIGURE IT OUT
[2:40:07] <Phoenon> Lotion: On, oh yeah, it's DSP time
[2:40:07] <%rumtumtugnutz> Biggest advantage to physical is it doesn;t use up as much hard drive space
[2:40:08] <WanderingSwordsman> Steal the controller from the ginger goblin
[2:40:09] <SleepyMaribo> i havent laughed that hard in a while
[2:40:13] <Captain_Aham> that's mad ×23
[2:40:16] <transporterthesequel> You could go with the Aris school of thought and SHOOT THEM
[2:40:20] <+BlindingFlash> imagine thinking that talking about different skills is backseating must suck to bee that uptight
[2:40:21] <Captain_Aham> chat's*
[2:40:24] <%Futurecity10> @AngriestPat You want a hint for the hidden wall on this map or nah?
[2:40:40] <%SilvaChariot0133> But wait, that's the poin....
[2:40:40] <@lewdskeletor13> Backseating? In this chat? Neverrrr
[2:40:41] <al0nem0nster> So spite
[2:40:41] <%SilvaChariot0133> NotLikeTHis
[2:40:42] <%Soul_Intern> That would take time and be smart Pat
[2:40:44] <hassanico1> Except you never use abilities
[2:40:47] <%reonome> good job chat
[2:40:47] <al0nem0nster> yeah that's a good play.
[2:40:48] <%SilvaChariot0133> NotLikeThis
[2:40:49] <transporterthesequel> AAHAHAHA
[2:40:51] <iaraCatunda> to be fair it's hard to write like that on twitch chat
[2:40:55] <vVAstrAVv> typing all that is haaaaarrrd
[2:40:55] <transporterthesequel> Autobind TO HELL
[2:40:57] <hassanico1> And you just totally had a meltdown cause someone suggested using multiple legion
[2:41:01] <Archmortal> to ignore the ability system, you would have to not equip abilities.
[2:41:04] <Phoenon> I do like stun on Doggo since it never stops being effective
[2:41:04] <KitsuneManami> @AngriestPat But I told you nicely in first stream :(
[2:41:04] <%Ranryu692> it's not like Platinum Standard is difficult
[2:41:05] <+Darren716> But Pat this is how youd react to sub-optimal play
[2:41:07] <%GeneralSCPatton> Don't worry guys. When P+ Ultimate starts kicking his ass, and the controls are second-nature, he'll probably make his shit more complex.
[2:41:09] <+darquezsmith> it's cool pat just play now you want
[2:41:11] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> I like that. All chat had to do was talk nice. You fucked up chat.
[2:41:18] <%pilgrimsayswhat> Okay so are Legions just invisibile to normies then
[2:41:18] <hassanico1> @AngriestPat when someone suggested using multiple legions calmly you just freaked out about it instead
[2:41:20] <iaraCatunda> when you're on twitch chat you're full lizard brain
[2:41:21] <%doc_ock_rokc> Doggo time
[2:41:22] <%DeathsDoom> one cool thing is power charge and speed star transfer to legions if you swap
[2:41:28] <+rogoho> No one is going to say all that in chat
[2:41:28] <%Deft_Thought> @AngriestPat Do you feel like you stick to a legion or two in fights or do you find yourself moving through the whole gang?
[2:41:28] <PizzicatoFive5> Patrick, viste lo que pasó en la Tokyo Game Show? no mames
[2:41:32] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Aka "YOU'RE breath taking!"
[2:41:33] <ShichiNoBushi> "Buried somewhere" = use doggo.
[2:41:34] <%brickwall35> Pat doesn't want to be talked nice to. he has a bully kink.
[2:41:36] <SleepyMaribo> Legal Drugs!
[2:41:37] <+rogoho> Brevity
[2:41:40] <@lewdskeletor13> BabyRage paaaaaaaaat
[2:41:41] <KitsuneManami> Kill that fucker
[2:41:41] <%Deft_Thought> I feel like I'd default to one
[2:41:43] <%ArcanumMBD> Hey pat did you know you can make your character stronger and have more style if you have autobind on every legion? its true!
[2:41:47] <%StaceMcGate> SAve kitty!
[2:41:51] <%Soul_Intern> @PizzicatoFive5 Estamos en un chat Norteamericano
[2:41:51] <%pilgrimsayswhat> Kill the doctor for being a fuck
[2:41:51] <%Ranryu692> time for work. g'night all
[2:41:52] <Phoenon> American Medicare
[2:41:53] <iaraCatunda> @brickwall35 LUL
[2:41:56] <%42nfl19> buried? use doggo legion @AngriestPat ?
[2:41:59] <@lewdskeletor13> @ranryu692 Night!
[2:41:59] <hassanico1> @Deft_Thought he just said earlier he refuses to ever switch legions
[2:42:02] <KitsuneManami> Pat Rhymes with Cat, THATS WHY HE LIKES CATS!
[2:42:04] <jubejube56> Who doesn't have a map nowadays?
[2:42:08] <Sphincter_Spelunker> @rumtumtugnutz I just forgot about the paid online and figured I wasn't gonna use the e shop or multiplayer games
[2:42:10] <%NeroInfinite> Ahhh the corruption
[2:42:11] <%doc_ock_rokc> Silent Hill?
[2:42:12] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat fog appears after clearing main quest
[2:42:13] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Is the fog the Hiss?
[2:42:18] <AllenDeadman> oh shit p4?
[2:42:18] <%Deft_Thought> @hassanico1 Oh, I missed that
[2:42:28] <Saltmeisterr> guilty gear news?
[2:42:34] <vVAstrAVv> HEY PAT....DO YOU LIKE NINETAILS
[2:42:36] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Does the outfit matter, or is it purely cosmetic? (Will you be KoS in that uniform?) I thought the flying donut said something about different clothes.
[2:42:40] <%bevyrage> i wonder if you end up going to the cat hospice your adopted dad set up and akira is there
[2:42:40] <%NeroInfinite> She's just FULL of corrupto juice
[2:42:49] <hassanico1> @Deft_Thought it was pretty bad for the latest boss fight
[2:42:50] <%totesmcgoat_> The POLICE in block letters on an enormous sword is fucking hilarious
[2:42:50] <al0nem0nster> missed a pickup
[2:42:56] <%brickwall35> Pat drop you're shield
[2:43:01] <%StaceMcGate> main story?
[2:43:03] <Phoenon> Howl is 10/10
[2:43:08] <%arancet> howl and autobind is redundant
[2:43:09] <%worldbrand> Howl's pretty great
[2:43:09] <%brickwall35> your*
[2:43:18] <%StaceMcGate> chain drive is fun
[2:43:21] <iaraCatunda> sync keep sucks!!!!
[2:43:22] <al0nem0nster> yeah the abilities seem a bit subpar in this game.
[2:43:23] <+BlindingFlash> even speedstar you get to just facerool everythign with it and blue shield
[2:43:24] <%Futurecity10> @AngriestPat A lot of quests show up after completion of most of the side quests in this mission. Just keep a look out on the main menu
[2:43:25] <Buzzard42> Chain Drive is nuts
[2:43:30] <Cranky_Construct> Tbh same? A lot of their abilities are too situation-specific for me to want to equip
[2:43:30] <Buzzard42> Speed Star is also nuts
[2:43:31] <Idon__> but power charge means NUMBER GO UP
[2:43:32] <Phoenon> Motivation Sword
[2:43:32] <@lewdskeletor13> I’ve heard the abilities aren’t great
[2:43:33] <UnfilteredComic> Crash Bomb is a 2.5 second cooldown
[2:43:38] <%Deft_Thought> Crash bomb seems neat cuz you can wrap your chain around em
[2:43:39] <%worldbrand> Wait do we mean skills or abilities, because Abilities is what the passives are called
[2:43:40] <vVAstrAVv> yeah the abilities that are just a buff are lame
[2:43:40] <+HyperCharge_Sam> No, I agree Pat
[2:43:41] <doggieo> If you have the Effect Spread ability that legions abilitys apply to everyone.
[2:43:41] <%NeroInfinite> That's a fair enough pat.
[2:43:42] <+BlindingFlash> like oncer i got axe blue shield+speed star auto mash every boss
[2:43:44] <%arancet> hit rush is a really good back up on any of them
[2:43:44] <%StaceMcGate> Arrow Slow Bomb is my go to
[2:43:45] <%dekkitout> Would they be better if the abilities were more like combos that unlocked?
[2:43:46] <iaraCatunda> I don't understand how to use sync keep
[2:43:47] <Sokumotanaka> you're insane pat
[2:43:47] <+Darkmuramasa> I mostly just spam use certain abilities to get the Order for them done.
[2:43:50] <+HyperCharge_Sam> the only good ones are at the very end of the skill trees
[2:43:51] <%Laecerelius> Turning your arrow legion into a turret sounds pretty good
[2:43:51] <%enickma11> Crash Bomb is ridiculously OP
[2:43:55] <cassiecagedd> Auto Bind is sick. i think hit rush is sick on bow Stand. just because you can swap out bow when its using hit rush at a range.
[2:43:55] <SleepyMaribo> yeah im the same, most of the abilities are meh
[2:43:55] <Buzzard42> yeah that's an ability to spam
[2:43:56] <%Big_Dream> @AngriestPat sync keep is good pat because it buffs speed and dmg of attacks for you and legion
[2:43:56] <al0nem0nster> Someone was saying hit rush is good on arrow because it's continous dps as you switch to another legion.
[2:44:05] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Is there some cool combo shit you're missing that you can chain? Not just individual abilities but buildups?
[2:44:06] <%rumtumtugnutz> @Sphincter_Spelunker Yeah, it's kinda nonsense really.
[2:44:07] <%reonome> we win!
[2:44:11] <%brickwall35> chat wins!
[2:44:15] <%malacante> that hit rush tactic seems good but also such a pain
[2:44:16] <%Monkeyweed21> as long as you get by its good
[2:44:17] <WanderingSwordsman> the 2nd arrow's ability is solid
[2:44:18] <%arancet> auto-bind great on axe at least cause of his slow ass
[2:44:18] <%Soul_Intern> Its ok Pat you can play the game in the way you want to
[2:44:19] <Captain_Aham> you've come too far
[2:44:24] <Phoenon> Arrow Hit Rush is worth a shot, it lasts stupid long
[2:44:27] <ChaoticDaKiller> crash bomb and the arm legions gravity well is a good combo
[2:44:27] <+Darren716> Honestly Axe would be the best to have auto bind on
[2:44:28] <%Soul_Intern> Abilities dont really change the gameplay that much
[2:44:30] <+Darren716> Since it's so slow
[2:44:36] <%Soul_Intern> Classic Pat moment
[2:44:37] <%Monkeyweed21> wait why
[2:44:38] <%Deft_Thought> 🤔
[2:44:38] <+darquezsmith> Don't give in play how you want
[2:44:43] <Buzzard42> You'll have to use abilities in Chapter 12 tbh
[2:44:44] <%StaceMcGate> well if you don't want S+
[2:44:45] <%Soul_Intern> @Monkeyweed21 He forgets
[2:44:47] <+Darren716> He might need the abilities later
[2:44:50] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> I like to swing my fists until the noises stop.
[2:44:51] <%republicofu> I actually tend to forget about them
[2:44:51] <vVAstrAVv> just try not having the goblins lol
[2:44:52] <UnfilteredComic> Youll have time to get it in muscle memory
[2:45:02] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> Nah, I make a point to use abilities. Makes it more likely to get S+.
[2:45:03] <%malacante> Also I'm glad no one in chat is freaking out about everyone calling skills abilities oh no shit its me
[2:45:07] <Buzzard42> a lot of the combat challenges require you to use them to do well
[2:45:08] <%SilvaChariot0133> apatGoblin
[2:45:09] <%Deft_Thought> The hit rush is cool cuz you can jump to another Legion and they just run around and keep using it
[2:45:12] <ISkyHunterI> Guilty Gear now get hype PogChamp
[2:45:12] <%NeroInfinite> Arm and Axe are fine with auto bind since they aren't the fastest
[2:45:13] <ALazo> I've taken a liking to power charge. I pick a legion with unique skills I don't like, give it auto-hit and power charge. Then I get to buff myself, unchain the thing so that it distracts the monster, and then switch to the legion I actually want to do damage with.
[2:45:16] <%Soul_Intern> Youre gonna regret not being accostumed to doing them lol
[2:45:18] <%BioApple> when in doubt, use the powerups since they're always at least kind of useful
[2:45:23] <powerfulhairline> @angriestpat which control scheme are you using?
[2:45:28] <jubejube56> Abilities are almost a must in file 12, whether or not you learn to use them now is up to you
[2:45:30] <Phoenon> SPEEN
[2:45:30] <Mendin> look what you did chat, you stirred up the mind goblins
[2:45:30] <+HyperCharge_Sam> Auto Bind is good on slow legions cause they take forever to move
[2:45:30] <AllenDeadman> GG news happening now, I'll be back
[2:45:39] <%dekkitout> "But you'll have to learn how to do trigonometry to advance to calculus" "Well I'm not taking calculus now..."
[2:45:39] <Hyp3r4ctive> I didn't like using abilities cause often I felt like I had to stop moving entirely for them to activate, and what good is that in a fast moving character action game
[2:45:41] <WanderingSwordsman> let him play until file 12 comes to kick his ass like bloody palace
[2:45:47] <%Deft_Thought> It's weird that you can only put two abilities on at a time
[2:45:47] <al0nem0nster> Well if you like the attack up's in the add ons you might as well just give them all buff abilities right? for the extra dps?
[2:45:48] <%StaceMcGate> Platinum has trained me for 14 years not to use items and now they just throw them in my face
[2:45:59] <jubejube56> I think chain drive is trash
[2:46:00] <+amurter19> guitly gear thing is haooening now *rusn fro mastral chain spoilers*
[2:46:02] <+HyperCharge_Sam> it looks awful I never used chain drive
[2:46:06] <al0nem0nster> that way you can just increase the attack even further and ignore abilities entirely again.
[2:46:07] <UnfilteredComic> I dont like Chain Drive
[2:46:07] <+darquezsmith> it's not
[2:46:12] <vVAstrAVv> @mendin i do regret my words and deeds
[2:46:17] <MattDemers> Speed Star: it's lightning in the jungle
[2:46:18] <%arancet> @AngriestPat i didnt enjoy using chain drive much, but it is really good damage if you line it up
[2:46:23] <Phoenon> YEAH FAST
[2:46:24] <hassanico1> @AngriestPat does the fact these skills don't use a resource or energy make them more forgettable?
[2:46:28] <%Soul_Intern> F A S T
[2:46:32] <%SilvaChariot0133> lytALRIGHT
[2:46:42] <%Soul_Intern> S P E E D
[2:46:45] <SleepyMaribo> axe legion so good
[2:46:45] <Captain_Aham> sanic boi
[2:46:49] <powerprotoman> can you have blue shield while in arm legion mode
[2:46:53] <%BioApple> so are the speed/power upgrades percentage-based or flat increase?
[2:46:56] <%StaceMcGate> 60% of skills are just powerups
[2:46:57] <%brickwall35> Sonic boom, Sonic boom
[2:46:57] <al0nem0nster> hopefully the ability system will be expanded upon or eradicated for more combos if there's a sequel.
[2:46:58] <+Darren716> I was the same way, you forget them in the rush
[2:47:02] <powerprotoman> speed star into arm legion for jojos
[2:47:02] <%BioApple> abilities*
[2:47:04] <UnfilteredComic> End Axe Combos with Crash Bomb to animation cancel
[2:47:06] <GuilKato> pat is attacking random civilian
[2:47:07] <%CrypticMochi> Mental mapping the legions into a role might help you memorize the abilities
[2:47:07] <vVAstrAVv> @powerprotoman he can
[2:47:15] <hassanico1> Eh it happens
[2:47:16] <GuilKato> or random civilian is very confused by your dancing
[2:47:17] <+Darren716> I use them all the time in 12 though since i can spam hit rush to get another legion out
[2:47:18] <TigerClaws12> oh shit guilty gear is up
[2:47:21] <al0nem0nster> the pickup's in this game are useless but you did miss one anyway
[2:47:22] <%BoboDaHobo> the fundamentals are so engaging that it's hard to remember the abilities
[2:47:26] <%Monkeyweed21> cumbo likes consistency over variety
[2:47:27] <+BlindingFlash> yeah blue shield stays out its insane once stuff starts doing half your health
[2:47:27] <%Soul_Intern> BROTHER
[2:47:33] <%StaceMcGate> this case is a waste of life
[2:47:34] <+Darren716> Ooh this quest, it's so clever
[2:47:51] <%dekkitout> Brother, can you spare some measurements
[2:47:55] <eldragon_1> Guilty Gear thing is on
[2:48:00] <+Darren716> Are you ready for math
[2:48:00] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> I love the idea that nobody around you can see what you're doing, and you look like an idiot swinging your arms around.
[2:48:02] <+OUTheTeam> i feel like when you get into it the abilities can sync really well with combat
[2:48:26] <TigerClaws12> math NotLikeThis
[2:48:29] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> But then the boxes explode so they think you're a witch or some shit.
[2:48:53] <ShichiNoBushi> "How'd you get over there!?"
[2:49:09] <%StaceMcGate> addition time!
[2:49:12] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> yay basic math
[2:49:13] <+HyperCharge_Sam> time to do big math
[2:49:15] <%d00msdaydan> time for MATH
[2:49:16] <%Laecerelius> Maaath!
[2:49:19] <Rexenexus> sugoiBestgirl
[2:49:21] <Daxalog> @AngriestPat Now that you have merged with your pocket monsters do they fidget around angrily?
[2:49:22] <%42nfl19> OH NO MATH
[2:49:29] <jubejube56> Now imagine how much easier this side misson would have been switch speed star + beast legion
[2:49:32] <%ToadKing> ur so smart
[2:49:34] <powerprotoman> "15"
[2:49:35] <%dekkitout> I'm ready for some Pythagorean shit
[2:49:37] <ShichiNoBushi> Geometry's for nerds.
[2:49:38] <ArmoredRevenger> good quick mental math big brain
[2:49:38] <%Piemen99> 15? oh
[2:49:47] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> He's too scared to talk to the witch.
[2:49:53] <Phoenon> Not police anymore, free to trash the place PogChamp
[2:50:04] <%dekkitout> Wow they actually didn't make you solve for hypotenuse? 0/10
[2:50:10] <%Monkeyweed21> is this discrimination against americans?
[2:50:23] <%Soul_Intern> apatJpeg
[2:50:27] <%malacante> it's that dog!
[2:50:29] <%1matheuw> murica measurement systems big sucks
[2:50:29] <ChaoticDaKiller> America doesn't exist anymore in astral chain
[2:50:30] <Phoenon> I'm not gonna sit here and let you badmouth the greatest democracy the world has ever known
[2:50:33] <%Ion_Laser> apatJpeg
[2:50:34] <%Goobbue> apatJpeg apatJpeg apatJpeg
[2:50:35] <%42nfl19> @AngriestPat Try and use the doggo to find the buried treasure that was hinted at? Also maybe cat as well.
[2:50:39] <%StaceMcGate> this game does not allow pets, 0/10
[2:50:39] <fIashman92> Guilty Gear time
[2:50:53] <UnfilteredComic> It sucks
[2:50:55] <GuilKato> you made him a dog
[2:50:56] <%malacante> you have 5 pets! slash slaves
[2:50:56] <%BioApple> what are you talking about, you got five pets right there
[2:50:57] <jubejube56> That is whyit sucks
[2:50:57] <%NeroInfinite> yeah
[2:50:57] <ArmoredRevenger> the chain hurts
[2:50:58] <cassiecagedd> the chain hurt
[2:50:59] <+Darren716> Yeah its crap
[2:51:01] <%Soul_Intern> CARLOS
[2:51:03] <cassiecagedd> its bad hahaha
[2:51:04] <%StaceMcGate> chain drive is great against mobs
[2:51:04] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> As a 'Murican, I use both measurements and don't give a fuck.
[2:51:06] <%Soul_Intern> THEY GOT HIM
[2:51:06] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> you wrap it around them. And yeah, that's the worst thing about it.
[2:51:09] <+Jonesman64> CARLOS
[2:51:09] <Zebroneath> Is there any way to integrate that into a combo?
[2:51:10] <WanderingSwordsman> @AngriestPat the gravity bomb works on most bosses
[2:51:12] <+Darren716> Also it does hurt enemies you tie up
[2:51:17] <%Soul_Intern> NO CARLOS
[2:51:17] <%ToadKing> carlos no!
[2:51:17] <%GeneralSCPatton> How dare THEY
[2:51:19] <%dekkitout> Carlos, don't you die on me!
[2:51:21] <%FirearmsInstructor> WHOOOO?
[2:51:21] <%Ion_Laser> Damn you THEY!
[2:51:23] <%Laecerelius> Gravity bomb seems pretty awesome
[2:51:23] <%Big_Dream> take a picture of of carlos when he is in his underwear for the album
[2:51:23] <ChaoticDaKiller> CARLOS WHO?
[2:51:26] <hassanico1> THEY
[2:51:26] <al0nem0nster> "Carlos who?" HAH

[2:51:31] <%Soul_Intern> YES CARLOS
[2:51:34] <%Big_Dream> it vounts

[2:51:48] <vVAstrAVv> CAN carlos die?
[2:51:49] <%d00msdaydan> finally, realistic depiction of police officers in this game
[2:51:49] <%dekkitout> But Carlos, that's- illegal!
[2:51:51] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Carlos is a good guy.
[2:51:53] <iaraCatunda> die Carlos
[2:51:59] <@lewdskeletor13> Carlos you fuck
[2:51:59] <Idon__> shut up he's nice
[2:52:05] <%Frostydough1> IS THAT JEREMIAH GOTTWALD??
[2:52:11] <%Laecerelius> Carlos loves polishing his rod
[2:52:16] <Sokumotanaka> You know he could of just fought you idiot
[2:52:17] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> He'll buy you a burger at his uncle's shop.
[2:52:18] <%ShaneWhite> But he’s your asshole Pat
[2:52:20] <vVAstrAVv> hes not an asshole hes juuust stupid lol
[2:52:20] <ActualNobody6400> It was carlos all along, I swear to god...
[2:52:21] <+reluctant_monkey> OFC Carlos would polish his batton
[2:52:28] <%Big_Dream> @AngriestPat take picture of carlos in his underwear for an order completion
[2:52:35] <cassiecagedd> puppy paws
[2:52:36] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> Fuckin Orange Boy.
[2:52:36] <Aamoth> !uptime
[2:52:36] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 52m.
[2:52:41] <%BioApple> it's gotta be pretty hard to polish a weapon made of ghost matter
[2:52:42] <%42nfl19> @AngriestPat what are the green zones on the map? the side quest areas?
[2:52:52] <ChaoticDaKiller> Hal says the beast legion can't actually smell SO WHY IS IT SNIFFING THE GROUND
[2:53:04] <%StaceMcGate> main quest stuff
[2:53:04] <gekizenbu> its simuating sniffing by reading data obv
[2:53:06] <hassanico1> @ChaoticDaKiller data
[2:53:09] <Idon__> delicious rorbs- I mean ratters
[2:53:19] <%BioApple> beast legion is a cross-dimensional furry RPer
[2:53:52] <%d00msdaydan> give the cat food to the dog
[2:53:56] <%Soul_Intern> Why would you say that
[2:54:01] <%arancet> @AngriestPat nibbled cat food is a quest item..
[2:54:05] <%malacante> how does the beast legion connect to the police database anyway
[2:54:11] <+Estuko> @BioApple plrease
[2:54:15] <iaraCatunda> @bioapple I wish I could unread this sentence
[2:54:23] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Just air hump that guy to heal him
[2:54:23] <%dekkitout> A vpn tajPF
[2:54:25] <%malacante> why did Hal try to give an explanation that makes even less sense than just it sniff
[2:54:28] <Phoenon> Nice to not have to rescent every time Beast is out
[2:54:31] <Sphincter_Spelunker> THEY
[2:54:32] <%Soul_Intern> ITS THEY
[2:54:35] <al0nem0nster> yep
[2:54:37] <%arancet> ACTION ROLL
[2:54:37] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> lololol
[2:54:40] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat More like a barrel roll
[2:54:40] <%dekkitout> Would you not?
[2:54:42] <Ciriliko> sick back rolll dude
[2:54:42] <%CherrieVelvet> tactical roll
[2:54:57] <Sphincter_Spelunker> YEAH YEAH
[2:54:58] <%StaceMcGate> I like how Pat didn't change out of his cop uniform
[2:55:01] <%42nfl19> I wonder if the conversation would be different if you used the civie outfit @AngriestPat
[2:55:01] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> I fuckin love this dude.
[2:55:03] <%Shadicara> LAW
[2:55:06] <%bevyrage> i'm a fan of how dramatic carlos is
[2:55:07] <%Ion_Laser> LAW
[2:55:09] <%dekkitout> Time for apatBig JUSTICE
[2:55:10] <%NeroInfinite> HE HAS A GUN NOW HE IS HTE LAW
[2:55:12] <UnfilteredComic> SourPls Love this battle mix
[2:55:21] <%Frostydough1> is that fucking kaneki
[2:55:22] <Idon__> Police Brutality has never been more stylish
[2:55:32] <Ciriliko> hi im Carlos im a voice actor"
[2:55:35] <%BioApple> civvie fights are the best use of auto-bind, just ends them immediately
[2:55:39] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> oh dear
[2:55:42] <%Soul_Intern> CARLOS NO
[2:55:42] <%StaceMcGate> ded

[2:56:01] <%Ion_Laser> Carlos is fiiiiiiine
[2:56:03] <californaya> I can't believe Carlos is fucking dead
[2:56:05] <iaraCatunda> is this whole thing a Sidequest?
[2:56:07] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Wait, was that from their perspective? Why couldn't we see the Chimeras
[2:56:07] <Phoenon> He'll be fiiiine
[2:56:12] <UnfilteredComic> @iaraCatunda Yes
[2:56:13] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Don't forget the pre-cutscene alley with the red stuff back to the right.
[2:56:14] <%AgentOrangeShoes> 410 BILLION DEAD CARLOSES
[2:56:19] <Idon__> They were sucked in, not carried in
[2:56:24] <Idon__> or osmething
[2:56:27] <Idon__> PAT HOW
[2:56:28] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> I hope Carlos gets his own stand and follows you around.
[2:56:28] <%Ion_Laser> :D
[2:56:29] <%Soul_Intern> NICE
[2:56:32] <%dekkitout> Why did I read that as calories LUL
[2:56:33] <ArmoredRevenger> lol
[2:56:44] <ISkyHunterI> @AngriestPat why do you call it the frame rate dimension
[2:56:46] <KitsuneManami> @AngriestPat how much longer you got left playin today?
[2:56:49] <+ATorL> you missed one I think
[2:56:50] <reddpop_> because chat is a hivemind
[2:56:51] <%42nfl19> ride doggo for extra speed
[2:56:55] <%d00msdaydan> (use your legion/stand to complete the mission/level)
[2:56:55] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @dekkitout Are you hungry by any chance?
[2:56:59] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> The Collective Consciousness of Chat.
[2:57:03] <%dekkitout> For once, no
[2:57:04] <%bevyrage> 'I'll be scrubbing this whole thing' he says before passing by a bunch of red crystals
[2:57:06] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> Otherwise known as C3.
[2:57:08] <%CrypticMochi> Less to focus on
[2:57:10] <Idon__> This mission is suuuuper long
[2:57:12] <%decisivelynameless> This mission is super long
[2:57:18] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> damn, I had a dad joke lined up too
[2:57:26] <%SilvaChariot0133> Not quite File 06 long, but it's up there
[2:57:32] <+ATorL> My favorite part of redoing AC missions is getting to the end with 99% red matter
[2:57:34] <%FirearmsInstructor> What is red matter? Why's he collecting it? I keep having to go AFK and miss details. ;(
[2:57:53] <Daxalog> Radio Whales
[2:57:55] <GuilKato> a radial Whale?
[2:57:57] <%BioApple> it'd make more sense to save some of this mission for next stream since F11 is pretty short iirc (unless you're planning to postgame on stream)
[2:57:57] <%Monkeyweed21> then dont
[2:58:00] <vVAstrAVv> noone does lol
[2:58:05] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Ratchet and Clank vibes :(
[2:58:06] <%Monkeyweed21> just press y
[2:58:08] <iaraCatunda> LUL same
[2:58:08] <ShichiNoBushi> Whould you prefer a dropdown menu?
[2:58:08] <%Goobbue> How would you make it different?
[2:58:09] <vVAstrAVv> radials suck lol
[2:58:11] <noobpsyboticus> weird complaint
[2:58:12] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Yeah, I feel the way DMC V handled it is a little better.
[2:58:12] <jubejube56> Well you could also just tap the button quickly, idk what a better alternative is
[2:58:12] <GuilKato> is is a humpback radial whale?
[2:58:13] <+ATorL> I just tap Y and use them sequentially
[2:58:13] <%McSnazzyPants> you don't need to open the wheel all the way, a quick flick will do
[2:58:16] <%dekkitout> What's the best version of a radial wheel like thing you've used?
[2:58:16] <%GeneralSCPatton> Count the Y taps?
[2:58:20] <GuilKato> or a false killer radial whale
[2:58:22] <KitsuneManami> I like to switch between them each combo
[2:58:23] <%SilvaChariot0133> penta-directional pad when Kappa
[2:58:23] <%42nfl19> well that is the nature of the beast, a dpad does not have 5 directions
[2:58:26] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> You can arrange your legions so you can just do it with a button press, in your own determined legion combo
[2:58:28] <POUNDCAYK> that seems really janky with the fast pace you cna play this
[2:58:29] <vVAstrAVv> but it beats cycling with the shoulder button
[2:58:30] <Sokumotanaka> Something to fix in the sequel again
[2:58:33] <%Divryne> It's a free timestop nerd.
[2:58:52] <%Soul_Intern> Pat is just weird
[2:58:54] <%NeroInfinite> @AngriestPat Autobind doesn't multi bind
[2:58:55] <%CrypticMochi> Doesn’t look as cool as timestop
[2:58:59] <+Maximum_KIX> Just pressing the button works pretty well if you set them up in the order you like
[2:59:01] <%Soul_Intern> So lets not worry about his play style
[2:59:09] <Blank9> holding a trigger button + tapping a direction or shoulder button would be good for quick select in a sequel
[2:59:10] <Phoenon> thx Vergil Legion
[2:59:12] <%malacante> autobind absolutely does multibind
[2:59:14] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> Yeah, what @Maximum_KIX said.
[2:59:15] <%Kiiper> Whast? autobind does multibind
[2:59:17] <UnfilteredComic> It does
[2:59:21] <%Monkeyweed21> do whatever you want
[2:59:22] <vVAstrAVv> it binds at most 2 or 3
[2:59:25] <%StaceMcGate> its an aoe
[2:59:28] <GuilKato> so much red matter
[2:59:29] <noobpsyboticus> autobind definitely does multibind
[2:59:31] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> I bet they could trim down the legions, give other legions some of the other abilities, and make it super fast to switch between them all.
[2:59:32] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Is there a non-radial wheel setup? Can you set your preferences to the D-Pad or something for quick select?
[2:59:33] <cassiecagedd> thats more then 1 nerd hahaha
[2:59:35] <%dekkitout> Carlos my lad, welcome to the framerate dimension
[2:59:36] <%NeroInfinite> DOes it? Well shiit
[2:59:36] <%shurtal> Just got here? Still doin cop stuff huh? think we gonna finish tonight?
[2:59:41] <iaraCatunda> OH you can use a different legion during hit rush????
[2:59:42] <%king_wragles> It shows you that it binds multiple enemies in the fucking video FOR auto bind
[2:59:44] <Phoenon> Following VERY close behind
[2:59:48] <%BestTeaMaker> btw 2
[2:59:51] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> You can arrange them in the menu
[2:59:52] <@lewdskeletor13> Jesus Christ Carlos
[2:59:54] <Edible_Enthusiasm> escort mission 0:
[2:59:54] <al0nem0nster> Really if they make a sequel, they should just give you one legion,that you can fully customize the abilities of.
[2:59:54] <ShichiNoBushi> You got a party, now.
[2:59:57] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> the order by which you use them
[3:00:05] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat I hope that cool Monster Form isn't gonna be a thing that only shows up in cutscenes and for the final boss
[3:00:09] <%Kev1n36> Kev1n36 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months! apatDab
[3:00:10] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Trick-Sword-Gun-Roy-Trick
[3:00:20] <vVAstrAVv> i with you could unequip legions and just mash to cycle like 3
[3:00:20] <DGmaka> How many weapons did you have equipped for Dante DMC5?
[3:00:24] <%BestTeaMaker> @AngriestPat the thing that makes hitrush amazing is that you pop it on one legion, then switch to another legion so that now you have two legions out on the battlefield, where the hit rush'd legion is busy whaling on the enemy
[3:00:25] <%Monkeyweed21> doggo dig back there
[3:00:25] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> Have you tried arranging them in your preferred setup via the legion menu?
[3:00:26] <%Big_Dream> @Screamlord ssh
[3:00:31] <%42nfl19> @AngriestPat Is there a button that has not been used yet? Probably the DT button?
[3:00:35] <UnfilteredComic> IF they did a Sequel, what major gameplay fixes would you want?
[3:00:37] <%dekkitout> 'Being able to rebind Legion summon order' is now added to the "Things Astral Chain 2: 2Chainz needs"
[3:00:40] <%BestTeaMaker> I put hitrush on everyone so that i can cycle through them without losing damage
[3:00:45] <%Soul_Intern> Wow PAt
[3:00:46] <%StaceMcGate> they are doing a sequel
[3:00:48] <%1matheuw> Axe-Swo-Beast-Arm-Arro
[3:00:55] <%GeneralSCPatton> How quick can you switch by hitting Y? It's been a week since I played and I don't remember how smooth it is.
[3:00:56] <Sphincter_Spelunker> @DGmaka He pretty much only used Devil Sword when he got it
[3:00:59] <+ATorL> @ScreamLord you unlock it and can use it when you build a bar up enough
[3:01:18] <iaraCatunda> did iris just say arm??
[3:01:19] <ScreamLord> @ATorL cool
[3:01:27] <noobpsyboticus> @dekkitout it's already in the game dude
[3:01:48] <%malacante> its pretty smooth switching but it's hard to count on the fly how many presses to get to a specific legion
[3:01:49] <%FirearmsInstructor> Can anyone tell me what this red matter stuff is and why he's collecting it? I missed the explanation before.
[3:01:52] <%dekkitout> Is it now, well my list tracking is 1 item easier
[3:01:53] <DGmaka> @Sphincter_Spelunker on stream right? he did have variety in the lp
[3:02:04] <%SilvaChariot0133> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[3:02:05] <+ATorL> it's teaching you how it works,. pat
[3:02:06] <%BioApple> @FirearmsInstructor solid corruption basically, it's just for points
[3:02:11] <+ATorL> chains explosions to the touching blocks
[3:02:11] <%Monkeyweed21> dig on the hump
[3:02:14] <%FirearmsInstructor> @BioApple Thanks :)
[3:02:15] <ChaoticDaKiller> but what if there WAS something there pat
[3:02:15] <%GeneralSCPatton> @firearmsinstructor Concentrated corruption. Gotta clean it up.
[3:02:17] <UnfilteredComic> @FirearmsInstructor Solid "Corruption" its what redshifts ppl
[3:02:23] <%Monkeyweed21> dig
[3:02:25] <noobpsyboticus> I just hold the button and use a quick flick of the stick. it's pretty smooth when you get used to it
[3:02:26] <%StaceMcGate> @FirearmsInstructor bad collectathon gimmick that exists only to drive you insane and retrace your steps
[3:02:32] <+ATorL> next part is a puzzle where you have to move the detonator block to the right places if you want some chests
[3:02:34] <%FirearmsInstructor> @GeneralSCPatton @UnfilteredComic @StaceMcGate Thank you all :)
[3:02:44] <+ATorL> IIRC anyway
[3:02:44] <%FirearmsInstructor> @StaceMcGate lol
[3:02:47] <vVAstrAVv> @firearmsinstructor you get a prize for collecting a certain percentage and it lets you overcap your legions meter
[3:03:03] <+ATorL> might not be there yet
[3:03:25] <+ATorL> Astral Plane does all kind of blend together since it looks the same no matter what chapter you're on
[3:03:32] <spacecatstreams> ahhhhh
[3:03:34] <GuilKato> carlos is very chill about being in an extradimensional space
[3:03:35] <%StaceMcGate> there's like 5 more astral plane visits this file
[3:03:45] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> I'd fuck it
[3:03:45] <%BoboDaHobo> Carlos deserved a whole mission
[3:03:46] <cassiecagedd> HOT
[3:03:48] <%Soul_Intern> WAIFU
[3:03:48] <%Dr_Mooose> hot
[3:03:52] <%Laecerelius> ghost titties
[3:03:52] <%mankeyfigh> Did he do the cool boss fight?
[3:03:53] <%StaceMcGate> doggo
[3:03:57] <%Big_Dream> beast legion
[3:03:58] <%doc_ock_rokc> need doggo
[3:04:01] <%malacante> what class is artimis do you think?
[3:04:03] <vVAstrAVv> time for beast
[3:04:05] <al0nem0nster> OH that's why we couldn't see it.
[3:04:05] <%Monkeyweed21> need dog
[3:04:07] <%Big_Dream> need dog
[3:04:09] <+ATorL> Yeah I must be thinking of another Astral Plane section
[3:04:10] <%malacante> Im thinking gel
[3:04:11] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Goddess of the hunt
[3:04:16] <%Shadicara> Time for axe
[3:04:17] <%FlyingRamen> Artemis is a cool sword legion
[3:04:19] <%Shadicara> Kappa
[3:04:30] <+HyperCharge_Sam> beast legion to see him
[3:04:31] <%Monkeyweed21> use dog
[3:04:32] <%Soul_Intern> What if
[3:04:35] <%StaceMcGate> doggo
[3:04:35] <%Big_Dream> use dog
[3:04:36] <cassiecagedd> Oh beast lets you see invis
[3:04:36] <%NeroInfinite> Ah he can see the stands nowhuh?
[3:04:36] <%Soul_Intern> Just what if
[3:04:39] <%doc_ock_rokc> use dog to see invisible enemies
[3:04:42] <+DeaconBluesClues> i would assume Artemis would be a bow and arrow user
[3:04:43] <%Soul_Intern> Pat had a more faster legion
[3:04:44] <iaraCatunda> Carlos you big bitch
[3:04:45] <%sirisvirus> BEAST CAN SEE INVISIBLE ENEMIES
[3:04:46] <%dekkitout> Carlos can see her? Is Carlos now a stand user- cause I'd be on that hype train
[3:04:47] <vVAstrAVv> paaaat she cant turn invisible with pupper legion
[3:04:49] <%Monkeyweed21> use beast
[3:04:50] <%Soul_Intern> But thats impossible
[3:04:52] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> yes
[3:04:53] <%mankeyfigh> BEAST
[3:04:54] <%GeneralSCPatton> DOG BEATS CAMO
[3:04:59] <%NeroInfinite> dog vision
[3:05:00] <%Dr_Mooose> it's a dog, of course
[3:05:01] <%Big_Dream> pat
[3:05:01] <+ATorL> Beast Legion and IRIS, though IRIS can't be kept on in battle because attacking disables it
[3:05:02] <%ArcanumMBD> the game tells you this
[3:05:03] <+Darren716> Wait you didnt know?
[3:05:03] <%BioApple> yeah they gloss over that real fast
[3:05:06] <%Dr_Mooose> all dogs can do that
[3:05:06] <%Big_Dream> the game told you this
[3:05:06] <%Shadicara> LUL
[3:05:07] <%Divryne> THE GAME TOLD YOU.

[3:06:35] <%ArcanumMBD> you dont need to follow the law
[3:06:35] <+ATorL> Carlos is so melodramatic
[3:06:38] <ChaoticDaKiller> this choice actually matters for real tho
[3:06:38] <%Starlight_Gamer> is carlos luka?
[3:06:39] <ne0bunny> leave him behind!

[3:08:15] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Carlos will now take a mortal blow for you
[3:08:20] <%PauliusMaximus> Cant*
[3:08:21] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> I love characters like that.
[3:08:22] <%Soul_Intern> NICE
[3:08:22] <%StaceMcGate> NOT NOW HAL...sidequests
[3:08:26] <%Soul_Intern> Uh oh
[3:08:33] <mudapersona> Carlos will remember this.
[3:08:38] <%Soul_Intern> No Im doing sidequest hHal
[3:08:43] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Fuck off 9000 times Hal.
[3:08:44] <al0nem0nster> Time to see what the mysterious metal contraption was then I guess.
[3:08:48] <Phoenon> It's weird how text speed is always a second slower than when it finishes
[3:08:58] <ChaoticDaKiller> Carlos will only allow photos of himself not in uniform
[3:09:00] <iaraCatunda> did we meet hal in person? will we ever?
[3:09:08] <%Starlight_Gamer> Did Pat find the missing cat?
[3:09:13] <%tragicjohnson84> Busy doing the sweet sidequests!
[3:09:23] <%StaceMcGate> good lord this game needed a jump
[3:09:30] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @Phoenon It does that so the subtitles don't spoil you on events.
[3:09:32] <%BioApple> man the weather outside is mad weird
[3:09:40] <Captain_Aham> find the Elmo sidequest
[3:09:41] <Ciriliko> cute
[3:09:45] <+Fynale> beast legion is best legion
[3:09:46] <%42nfl19> multiple items for cat?
[3:09:49] <%mankeyfigh> @angriestpat How did you feel about the Jena fight and fusion transformation?
[3:09:56] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat btw, why do you take pictures of bosses and things but not save the image? XP? Unlocks? Not saving the images is throwing me off.
[3:10:16] <%BioApple> @FirearmsInstructor taking the picture fills out a database but you don't need to save it
[3:10:16] <%malacante> you unlock the database image whether or not you save the image
[3:10:19] <Flunkorg> @FirearmsInstructor Saving the pictures does nothing
[3:10:19] <%StaceMcGate> @FirearmsInstructor taking pictures updates the database on them, don't need to save
[3:10:25] <ne0bunny> you dont need to save the image to have the enemies added to your database
[3:10:38] <%Big_Dream> use axe leagion go past the gas
[3:10:38] <vVAstrAVv> @firearmsinstructor it unlocks the bestiary page. even without saving
[3:10:38] <grimporio> you have axe legion
[3:10:38] <cassiecagedd> axe boy
[3:10:40] <%BioApple> actually, on that note, how do you review the pictures you did save?
[3:10:41] <Rexenexus> LUL
[3:10:44] <%Capta1n_H3nry> Send it around the corner maybe?
[3:10:46] <Phoenon> Invisible wall'd
[3:10:49] <Flunkorg> Pat, use the axe legion
[3:10:53] <Rexenexus> nier automata invisible walls LUL
[3:10:56] <iaraCatunda> @firearmsinstructor there's only space for like 30 pics and just taking a picture adds to the databsde

[3:12:30] <%ShaneWhite> Red crack for Pat
[3:12:31] <Phoenon> Oh yeah the new skills you can get with the Rare Mats
[3:12:37] <Buzzard42> tbh you only need 80% of red matter in a mission to get the reward
[3:12:40] <Idon__> why is the vergil stand's ability healing again?
[3:12:41] <iaraCatunda> @king_wolf_rigger NotLikeThis
[3:12:43] <al0nem0nster> @malacante ....is it like what ff15 did with the pictures?
[3:12:44] <cassiecagedd> aw yeah
[3:12:49] <Buzzard42> BUT, brain goblins also compelled me to try and get 100% every time

[3:13:15] <Phoenon> Bodied LUL
[3:13:16] <%FirearmsInstructor> LOL
[3:13:16] <Buzzard42> same, same
[3:13:17] <Idon__> RIP ARROW
[3:13:18] <%NeroInfinite> niice
[3:13:21] <Buzzard42> LUL
[3:13:25] <Tha_Mik> nice
[3:13:26] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> you know what I would have loved? Being able to delete/turn in those extra abilities for something useful.
[3:13:29] <%StaceMcGate> RIP Arrow
[3:13:33] <Phoenon> Arrow Hit Rush is probably my favorite anyways
[3:13:40] <Phoenon> Great to just toss out there
[3:13:41] <cassiecagedd> same
[3:13:45] <Buzzard42> same, wish I could convert the extra abilities for gene code or something
[3:13:51] <vVAstrAVv> itsnt it the same move
[3:13:52] <DGmaka> Arrow hit rush is consistent damage
[3:13:56] <%Capta1n_H3nry> Is it just me or does Arm lose it's luster over the course of the game?
[3:14:13] <Vigonept> that's just zinogre wtr
[3:14:13] <vVAstrAVv> no arms amazing
[3:14:17] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @iaraCatunda If the Sword Legion didn't lift its leg, and air hump them, I wouldn't be thinking lewd thoughts, so really it's not my fault. hahahaha
[3:14:24] <%malacante> I used arm primarily for the whole game
[3:14:28] <%StaceMcGate> My Problem with Arm is it has the lamest skills, but its its unique action is my go to for damage
[3:14:32] <%StaceMcGate> ORA ORA
[3:14:43] <iaraCatunda> @king_wolf_rigger LUL you're correct
[3:14:52] <vVAstrAVv> its sync attack for your main conbo is pure invuln and staggers even power chimeras
[3:14:54] <Buzzard42> yeah when i use Arm in combat it's typically to suit up and Ora Ora a motherfucker
[3:14:58] <Phoenon> Arm Gravity sphere is 2gud for random mobs
[3:15:03] <iaraCatunda> Edward sword hands is my favorite legion
[3:15:03] <HibikiYamada> Arm's last skill is god like.
[3:15:15] <Buzzard42> I love Arrow's last skill
[3:15:16] <%BioApple> i need to use arm more, it's surprisingly versatile for being the heavy punch archetype
[3:15:18] <Buzzard42> slow arrows are bunkers
[3:15:22] <%joylent_blue> the gravity attack more than makes up for round bullet sucking ass
[3:15:35] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Finally off the force and no one to snitch on you for vandalism
[3:15:43] <%FirearmsInstructor> Love how he destroys a few thousand dollar dumpster for like a $5 mini medicine
[3:15:44] <%malacante> plus its bind sync is pretty good for auto bind
[3:15:46] <%Capta1n_H3nry> I use Arm hit rush while Sword binds enemies
[3:15:49] <%InugamiTheHound> iris! iris!! What I am fighting for!!
[3:15:50] <%StaceMcGate> Anyone else struggle to pull off the full circle x-baton/Legion commands? It should of been a half-circle
[3:16:02] <stabbityrabbit> Maybe I'm the only one, but everytime I see Astral Chain I can't help but think their original ideas were more interesting than the ones they went with.
[3:16:11] <jubejube56> actually not the kitty
[3:16:19] <%Capta1n_H3nry> Also, I love how 2B's voice is an IRIS voice
[3:16:21] <Idon__> Well I don't even know what the original ideas were so whatevs
[3:16:21] <Sokumotanaka> Or he's trying to lead you into a trap get outta there pat!
[3:16:22] <stabbityrabbit> Not trying to say it's a bad game, but one that could've been better.
[3:16:23] <%Soul_Intern> YEYEYEYEYEYEYEYYE
[3:16:23] <vVAstrAVv> what were the original ideas
[3:16:25] <Phoenon> FUCK YO MOBS
[3:16:27] <Idon__> holy shit the DAMAGE
[3:16:28] <Buzzard42> YEYEYEYE
[3:16:28] <+FackuIkari> HOLY SHIT!

[3:16:51] <%NeroInfinite> 'alright' he says
[3:16:57] <%Capta1n_H3nry> So far Arm has been my go-to slime killer because of snatch
[3:17:12] <%StaceMcGate> Yeah Arm trivializes slimes
[3:17:13] <Buzzard42> this is file 10, right
[3:17:17] <Idon__> now THIS is some shit
[3:17:20] <DGmaka> @Capta1n_H3nry how do you snatch?
[3:17:35] <Mendin> Hey what happens if you Irish Whip a charging chimera while you have electric chain?
[3:17:36] <iaraCatunda> eyy. chain drive was Almost useful
[3:17:36] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Beast Legion want the whole tiddy
[3:17:37] <vVAstrAVv> just send your legion like normal
[3:17:40] <Phoenon> SourPls
[3:17:42] <%Monkeyweed21> photo
[3:17:44] <%StaceMcGate> @DGmaka you just send out arm like, and it brings back small enemies

[3:17:53] <%Soul_Intern> YEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
[3:17:53] <%Capta1n_H3nry> @DGmaka When you send arm out via left trigger, it'll grab the enemy and bring it to you

[3:17:55] <%Ion_Laser> PogChamp
[3:17:56] <%SilvaChariot0133> *achoo*

[3:18:06] <al0nem0nster> ....hell it is a Claydoll.
[3:18:06] <Idon__> sword, dude, ya missed
[3:18:07] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Man, Pat's really good at Pokemon Snap.
[3:18:10] <%ShaneWhite> Mario odyssey boss
[3:18:20] <stabbityrabbit> @vVAstrAVv There were things like having the ability to level up your legion in a more traditional sense. Depending upon what stats you leveled it would gain the ability to change to a different type. Such as one with a lance arm and a shield arm.
[3:18:32] <seycheles> D:
[3:18:41] <+Fynale> ok this looks pretty hype
[3:18:49] <stabbityrabbit> Plus they were originally going to have a lot more legions.
[3:18:54] <+Fynale> all the camera tilts are fucking cool
[3:18:55] <POUNDCAYK> starcraft archon lookin ass
[3:19:01] <vVAstrAVv> oh nice. maybe next game i guess

[3:19:20] <%Capta1n_H3nry> YOU'VE GONE PALE
[3:19:20] <al0nem0nster> first death of the playthrough?
[3:19:20] <Finaldragoon> super armor can't save you from dying
[3:19:23] <+nekodelic> GREED
[3:19:25] <%FirearmsInstructor> Wait, why's he alive?
[3:19:25] <+reluctant_monkey> muerto
[3:19:26] <%SilvaChariot0133> Betrayed by your armor
[3:19:27] <%Puhff> Gawddamn
[3:19:32] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Are they just giving you mid-bosses that are variants on your own legions?
[3:19:33] <+HyperCharge_Sam> Super Armor does that to you, it's better just to take the hit and get invincable frames
[3:19:35] <%goose_attack_almanac> New Guilty Gear Trailer dropped
[3:19:37] <%NeroInfinite> No S rank for this
[3:19:39] <%FirearmsInstructor> Auto-defib?
[3:19:40] <iaraCatunda> @stabbityrabbit they said they wanted to make a trilogy so they'll probably do it in one of the sequels, this one was good for testing the waters
[3:19:40] <%goose_attack_almanac> May is confirmed!
[3:19:44] <%goose_attack_almanac> AND SHE'S AN ADULT NOW
[3:19:46] <%BioApple> @stabbityrabbit i can see why they nixed that tbh, makes more sense for a platinum game to have you work up to a more unified movelist
[3:19:48] <%goose_attack_almanac> OR CLOSE
[3:19:57] <%StaceMcGate> D
[3:20:01] <vVAstrAVv> nah you can s rank even if you die
[3:20:01] <+HyperCharge_Sam> S+
[3:20:05] <%Soul_Intern> S+
[3:20:06] <%NeroInfinite> Close isn't the same as being ana dult
[3:20:08] <UnfilteredComic> @goose_attack_almanac WHAT
[3:20:09] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Aw yeah~
[3:20:10] <%StaceMcGate> S+?!
[3:20:12] <Buzzard42> S+ baby
[3:20:12] <%Starlight_Gamer> LUL
[3:20:13] <%NeroInfinite> H o w
[3:20:18] <vVAstrAVv> told ya lol
[3:20:20] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> dying don't matter
[3:20:22] <%ToadKing> nope that was just a random gate
[3:20:23] <%NeroInfinite> no it wasn't a kitty
[3:20:24] <Buzzard42> no lol
[3:20:26] <%linkster291> Death and health lose don't affect score rank.
[3:20:28] <%worldbrand> wait holy shit may?!
[3:20:31] <Sphincter_Spelunker> @UnfilteredComic Someone in Max's chat said she was too old LUL
[3:20:31] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> style and using all your game mechanics does.
[3:20:33] <Damie904> How did you die ad get an S+?
[3:20:37] <%linkster291> Only amount of moves used.
[3:20:38] <%SilvaChariot0133> LUL
[3:20:40] <Idon__> *that* is the kitty
[3:20:40] <%Starlight_Gamer> WTF
[3:20:41] <ShichiNoBushi> Bell collar.
[3:20:41] <%ShaneWhite> No cat
[3:20:45] <+CharredChord> That was a giant arm chimera, not a kitty, silly
[3:20:45] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> May is a fictional character, therefore not a human. If it ain't human, how can laws work?
[3:20:54] <noobpsyboticus> probably my biggest complaint with the game is S+ is waaay too easy. next biggest complaint is shit platforming
[3:21:13] <%SilvaChariot0133> LUL
[3:21:22] <%FirearmsInstructor> THAT'S RAD
[3:21:23] <%NeroInfinite> YOu say that but theres a reason why dog fuckers get arrested @King_Wolf_Rigger
[3:21:27] <%malacante> lol poor doggo can't hit
[3:21:27] <+CharredChord> That sync attack never hits. swear to god.
[3:21:29] <+justianxix> Hey Pat, are you going to watch the Guilty Gear stuff from TGS?
[3:21:42] <%malacante> it hits normal enemies fine
[3:21:44] <%StaceMcGate> Yeah combat rank is too easy, but the fact minigames account for your rank is a travesty
[3:21:46] <iaraCatunda> @damie904 damage and deaths don't account into the rank, only how much you attack and the variety of combos. death only impacts your rank in the sense that it takes time away from attacking
[3:22:08] <AwesomeDan_> you get a lot of points for time
[3:22:09] <%SilvaChariot0133> 0-3
[3:22:17] <%SilvaChariot0133> 1-3
[3:22:18] <+CharredChord> Sync attacks aren't free
[3:22:31] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @NeroInfinite Well, okay. Dogs ARE living things so yeah
[3:22:33] <elbigante> this ranking system would be perfect for the game if it punished you for anything rather than rewarding you less
[3:22:33] <vVAstrAVv> yeah time feels like an insane score boost
[3:22:36] <noobpsyboticus> it's not as satisfying to S+ compared to something like dmc
[3:22:37] <+Clik404> @stacemcgate Not like Bayonetta Kappa

[3:23:09] <%CherrieVelvet> apatGib TakeNRG
[3:23:14] <%malacante> I think this ranking system is fine for Normal but it'd be nice if it got stricter at the higher difficulties
[3:23:14] <iaraCatunda> they should've made the rewards for s ranking and then made S+ ranking harder
[3:23:15] <noobpsyboticus> ye this chapter is fucking great
[3:23:18] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Pet the kitty, feed the kitty, store the kitty.
[3:23:24] <LorcaNomad> It's honestly kinda longer than you think lol

[3:23:35] <%arancet> @AngriestPat you havent even started the mission proper yet
[3:23:39] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Give that cat up so it safe.
[3:23:43] <powerprotoman> pat would never gvie up elmo
[3:23:43] <%StaceMcGate> @Clik404 stupid stealth mission and those balancing minigames are preventing me from S+ most of my files
[3:23:45] <%worldbrand> Yeah but i want the feet though
[3:23:47] <+Estuko> FeelsBadMan
[3:23:48] <Idon__> there's SOOOOOO much
[3:23:52] <iaraCatunda> I feel like they made S+ rank easier because of all the unlocks
[3:23:53] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat ... wait case reported? Aren't you on a Most Wanted list? Why are you submitting popo paperwork? lol
[3:23:54] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Cat's like "Alright"
[3:23:58] <%NeroInfinite> ah this is gonna be a long one
[3:23:59] <+CharredChord> The post game would fucking kill any chance of getting an S+ rank if you were punished for taking damage. Like holy shit would that be unfair.

[3:24:45] <%d00msdaydan> finally, the stream is worth watching

[3:27:52] <%Intolerable> @lewdskeletor13 He's ghetting a redbull refill

[3:30:23] <%Soul_Intern> It was pretty humerus apatSkelmo
[3:30:32] <Sphincter_Spelunker> @Estuko Well, dog's will just, at most, wonder where you are. My dad gave our Lab Mix when we had to move. Kept the dog away from my sister and I to make it easier. First time he saw the dog in weeks, he wagged his tail the second they made eye contact, from behind a kennel. :(
[3:30:40] <%StaceMcGate> new guilty gear trailer is just the same from before + 2 seconds of May redesign

[3:32:48] <@lewdskeletor13> I lose a piece of my sanity everytime
[3:32:51] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> I liked yesterday's stream, but I could live without knowing that so many people don't even manually aim their dick when pissing.
[3:32:52] <%Soul_Intern> And many more laughs
[3:32:54] <Sphincter_Spelunker> I forgot the stream was supposed to be Control it got so bad

[3:36:06] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @AngriestPat She should take propeller planes then.

[3:37:01] <%BoboDaHobo> no jet
[3:37:02] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @AngriestPat They aren't Jets. That the limit to the joke. Sorry.
[3:37:02] <+A0N33> Propeller planes have no JET lag Kappa
[3:37:04] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Maybe you take longer to travel, so the time zone difference is less abrupt? idk
[3:37:07] <%BoboDaHobo> no jet lag
[3:37:07] <@lewdskeletor13> Hot air balloons have zero jet lag
[3:37:09] <Valdorick> But the real question is - DID YOU REMEMBER THE COOKIES!?
[3:37:25] <Sphincter_Spelunker> who said that
[3:37:26] <+HyperCharge_Sam> that or the very bottem one
[3:37:27] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> Slow Shot

[3:37:29] <UnfilteredComic> The one below it
[3:37:30] <Phoenon> Slow Shot, yeah
[3:37:32] <%miguelrod777> i dunno
[3:37:32] <UnfilteredComic> I think
[3:37:33] <vVAstrAVv> that arrow skill is super cool yes
[3:37:33] <%BestTeaMaker> no, below it
[3:37:34] <@lewdskeletor13> Do you have the Konami code tho?
[3:37:40] <al0nem0nster> ....please verify, don't trust chat
[3:37:44] <+HyperCharge_Sam> thats the good one
[3:37:44] <%Soul_Intern> Pat will figure it out
[3:37:45] <@lewdskeletor13> It’s “Pachinko”
[3:37:50] <%BestTeaMaker> there it is
[3:37:50] <UnfilteredComic> Time Stop
[3:37:52] <doggieo> good skill
[3:37:55] <ExpressNode> Inject it with your genes
[3:37:55] <%BestTeaMaker> literally timestop arrows
[3:37:56] <Finaldragoon> literally ZA WARUDO shot
[3:37:59] <SlimeSlimeSlime> ZA WARUDO!
[3:38:00] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> That just leaves Three Swords on Sword
[3:38:03] <iaraCatunda> what does it do
[3:38:05] <%Soul_Intern> Za Warudo in arrow form
[3:38:07] <%miguelrod777> Toki wa tomare
[3:38:08] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> or whatever it was called
[3:38:09] <Phoenon> Box Shot
[3:38:11] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Looks like a snare
[3:38:13] <Mendin> Za Warudo Nuke
[3:38:14] <%Soul_Intern> WRYYYYYYY
[3:38:15] <Valdorick> Its a orbital laser?
[3:38:19] <vVAstrAVv> told u
[3:38:24] <%BestTeaMaker> it also has a relatively short cooldown
[3:38:25] <%Shadicara> ROAD ROLLA DA
[3:38:25] <@lewdskeletor13> That was indeed cool
[3:38:28] <%Monkeyweed21> RAGTIME
[3:38:28] <%BestTeaMaker> so spam it with gravity storm
[3:38:33] <iaraCatunda> nooo stream lagged and I missed
[3:38:34] <%BestTeaMaker> and everything will die
[3:38:41] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat autoheal is trash
[3:38:45] <%Soul_Intern> @BestTeaMaker Thats the best idea ive read all night
[3:39:04] <%42nfl19> MORE SLOW
[3:39:04] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> I could go for some tea
[3:39:11] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Why so many copies of the same thing? So you can have different Legions equip the same ability?
[3:39:17] <vVAstrAVv> dont even look at auto heal
[3:39:22] <%BestTeaMaker> slow arrows > gravity storm > howl > crash bomb > round sword
[3:39:23] <jubejube56> effect spread + slow attack!
[3:39:26] <%BestTeaMaker> everything dies
[3:39:27] <@lewdskeletor13> If you bring tea you have to bring enough to share with the rest of chat
[3:39:28] <Sphincter_Spelunker> don't shake auto heal's hands
[3:39:38] <+SnookTF2> Good God, this looks just like Nier.
[3:39:41] <%BestTeaMaker> does the chat deserve tea
[3:39:42] <%brickwall35> @firearmsinstructor because mind goblins apatGoblin

[3:39:53] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat Just gun for shared effect then
[3:39:54] <%Ascethetic> @AngriestPat cull the herd

[3:40:13] <%BestTeaMaker> I like the variety
[3:40:14] <cassiecagedd> Big good
[3:40:15] <%Laecerelius> Yeah, the abilities look as annoying as the chips in Nier
[3:40:16] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat shared effect puts that ability on all legions
[3:40:16] <%ShaneWhite> Really
[3:40:19] <%GeneralSCPatton> Feed them to each other. Do Persona fusion.
[3:40:20] <iaraCatunda> @snooktf2 nier but saturated
[3:40:22] <%BestTeaMaker> effect spread is probably what you want
[3:40:23] <%malacante> iiii
[3:40:24] <Caidezes> It's just the Automata chip system, Pat.
[3:40:25] <doggieo> Effect Spread
[3:40:29] <%Monkeyweed21> shared effect means it applies to ALL legions
[3:40:31] <@lewdskeletor13> Just tweet at Kamiya and tell him how much you dislike it. I’m sure he’ll hear you out
[3:40:33] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Oh hai doggy
[3:40:36] <+HyperCharge_Sam> Yeah, I kinda just want the Nier Automata approach
[3:40:38] <%Monkeyweed21> effect spread
[3:40:38] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> I'm not a fan of the overcomplexity either. Like, complex and different is nice, but not to the point where I have to remember what EACH of the five legions have equipped on them.
[3:40:39] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat effect spread* typo
[3:40:45] <vVAstrAVv> pat if legions were identicle youd have to change skills if hypothetically you wanted something besides attack up
[3:40:46] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Kojima is fuckin hilarious
[3:40:51] <%d00msdaydan> it was super randomized, just with less variability
[3:40:52] <%Louie_Salmon> It was to a degree
[3:40:53] <%arancet> it totaly was, its values had rng
[3:40:54] <agumon9000> @AngriestPat Like a few people I've heard from have basically made the game difficulty a joke since they found the atk 25% boost early and it made every fight A JOKE
[3:40:56] <%BestTeaMaker> well, it was sorta randomized in how much each chip cost
[3:41:02] <%BestTeaMaker> but yeah it didn't affect the effect
[3:41:03] <%Monkeyweed21> thats it
[3:41:03] <al0nem0nster> it's one of the + things
[3:41:05] <%Laecerelius> it's on your slow attack +2%
[3:41:07] <%Frostydough1> you're telling me a shrimp fried this rice
[3:41:13] <%malacante> slow effect spread is real good
[3:41:18] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat effect spread will put 2% slow attack on all legions, and yes its a plus
[3:41:19] <%BestTeaMaker> you passed an ability that had effect spread
[3:41:21] <jubejube56> You might like quick cooldown on the axe guy for more shields
[3:41:23] <elbigante> i thought effect spread only worked as like "if you legion is equipped but not out you still get the effect"
[3:41:26] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Is it that you don't like the system? Or you don't understand it or it's too complicated to bother with? Is it just poorly done? Seems convoluted as hell to me...
[3:41:26] <%Monkeyweed21> now EVERY legion has slow attack
[3:41:28] <iaraCatunda> its one of the plus things
[3:41:32] <iaraCatunda> LUL
[3:41:39] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> I've had Call Burst fuck me over in destroyed property
[3:41:40] <Phoenon> Spread Effect Fortitude looks good
[3:41:43] <vVAstrAVv> effect spread only gives you their buff when theyre not out too it doesn't pass to all legions afaik
[3:41:43] <al0nem0nster> does the affect spread come on attack +15s?
[3:41:44] <agumon9000> Nah this system is just bad
[3:41:46] <%BestTeaMaker> now every legion will do call burst
[3:41:49] <%worldbrand> I dont mind the system but I wish it were more robust than random drops
[3:41:51] <doggieo> ALL LEGIONS
[3:41:53] <al0nem0nster> can you have attack + 225 then?
[3:41:56] <noobpsyboticus> ability code system sucks ass
[3:41:57] <%BoboDaHobo> that's just when it's not called, not when the legion isn't selected
[3:41:58] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat effect spread means that all legions will share from that ability
[3:41:58] <%Soul_Intern> Oh god
[3:42:03] <elbigante> "WHEN LEGION IS NOT CALLED" so you still need it equipped
[3:42:03] <%Kiiper> effect spread ONLy does the main effect
[3:42:03] <+OUTheTeam> pat brain
[3:42:08] <%Soul_Intern> He cannot handle it
[3:42:11] <Sphincter_Spelunker> finishing the file tonight, eh
[3:42:11] <%malacante> who cares
[3:42:12] <%Ascethetic> @AngriestPat theyre saying keep the ones with equip effects
[3:42:12] <%republicofu> goblins
[3:42:14] <%BestTeaMaker> your slow attack also has effect spread already
[3:42:15] <ScreamLord> Use your words Pat
[3:42:16] <%SilvaChariot0133> apatGoblin
[3:42:17] <%GeneralSCPatton> BUT IF BABA
[3:42:18] <%VantomPayne> theres also the fact pat mostly played this on stream so he cant spend too much time on it and 80% of his response to it is 'i dont understand'
[3:42:19] <@lewdskeletor13> Pat is at risk
[3:42:19] <agumon9000> Also reminder. YOU CANNOT SELL ANY OF THESE. THEY WILL FILL YOUR INVENTORY FOREVER
[3:42:19] <%Monkeyweed21> you cant
[3:42:20] <%malacante> haha whats a sort
[3:42:21] <%Black_Machete> apatGoblin
[3:42:22] <%brickwall35> apatWhat apatGoblin apatWhat apatGoblin
[3:42:23] <%worldbrand> You got this far without it, you will be fine
[3:42:26] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat you can't, that's why I trash everything that isn'tthat
[3:42:29] <%Soul_Intern> ! BRAIN AT RISK !
[3:42:30] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat I mean you're kicking ass and getting S+ so you can just roll with what you have. It seems to be super effective.
[3:42:34] <vVAstrAVv> pat they were wrong don't worry about it
[3:42:35] <al0nem0nster> the pain is not worth the added efficiency
[3:42:36] <@lewdskeletor13> I actually agree this stuff bugs me
[3:42:37] <+HyperCharge_Sam> doesn't effect spread only effect you if your Legion is equiped? or does it apply to all of them?
[3:42:39] <%Louie_Salmon> @stacemcgate But what if you need those later
[3:42:44] <agumon9000> Just bulk trashing them is all you can do
[3:42:47] <agumon9000> which is dumb
[3:42:50] <%BestTeaMaker> yeah, the ability system isn't the greatest
[3:42:51] <%ShaneWhite> I don’t know Pat. I just play the game. apatLiz
[3:42:52] <agumon9000> why can you not sell these
[3:42:55] <%Shadicara> Sounds like you want effect spread on everything
[3:42:56] <%GeneralSCPatton> Wait for QoL patch to add good sort and auto-trash
[3:42:56] <%BestTeaMaker> i understand what they wanted to go for, but it's eh
[3:43:03] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Look at bottom... says "Sort by Set"
[3:43:04] <%BioApple> I just go for whatever abilities have two pluses as long as it's not that damn flick skill
[3:43:05] <%Soul_Intern> BUT
[3:43:07] <%StaceMcGate> yeah, you should of been able to recycle abilities into materials or genes
[3:43:07] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Have we reached Snailborne levels because chat won't shut up?
[3:43:08] <%SilvaChariot0133> It becomes passive for ALL
[3:43:08] <powerprotoman> Yes
[3:43:11] <%Shadicara> Yes
[3:43:11] <%SilvaChariot0133> yes
[3:43:11] <jubejube56> @AngriestPat lets say you have an ability on arrow legion that makes you not burn, normally this only works if your arrow legion is on the field. With effect spread, you do not need it on the field, but it needs to be equipped
[3:43:12] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Push in Right stick
[3:43:13] <%Louie_Salmon> Yes
[3:43:13] <%Kiiper> YES
[3:43:13] <@lewdskeletor13> Is this something Pat even really needs to fuck with
[3:43:14] <%BestTeaMaker> it means every legion has it
[3:43:14] <al0nem0nster> yes.
[3:43:14] <doggieo> yes
[3:43:14] <transporterthesequel> Yes pat pretty much!
[3:43:15] <%Monkeyweed21> yes
[3:43:15] <%BestTeaMaker> yes
[3:43:16] <Phoenon> Yeah that was confusing to me too, I thought it just meant it effected your character as well
[3:43:17] <ALazo> It's okay, Pat. We agree that the unsortable +s are shit. Actually, nevermind. We still have to deal with it, so it's not okay.
[3:43:18] <%doc_ock_rokc> apparently so
[3:43:19] <+HyperCharge_Sam> REALLY? WHAT!?!?
[3:43:22] <elbigante> NO it doesn't
[3:43:23] <WanderingSwordsman> no
[3:43:24] <SlimeSlimeSlime> 0_0 what?
[3:43:26] <%worldbrand> Do we know this for sure or are we taking one guy at his word?
[3:43:29] <ne0bunny> oh I thought it only applied to that legion
[3:43:29] <iaraCatunda> yes
[3:43:33] <%brickwall35> that doesn't sound right
[3:43:35] <%StaceMcGate> TIME TO TRASH
[3:43:38] <%Kiiper> @AngriestPat It only applys to the master skill though, sub skills do not effect spread
[3:43:45] <%moogleboy1984> so just find the best abilities, and pray for Effect Spread
[3:43:47] <%Kiiper> applies even
[3:43:47] <elbigante> I have auto heal on mine with effect spread but I only get auto healed when I have the legion equipped but not out @AngriestPat
[3:43:50] <%Monkeyweed21> just ignore it for now
[3:43:50] <vVAstrAVv> im really positive this is incorrect
[3:43:52] <noobpsyboticus> fuck this shit who cares
[3:43:53] <Caidezes> He'll never recover from this.
[3:43:54] <%Monkeyweed21> just do game
[3:43:54] <%Ascethetic> @AngriestPat theyre wrong, its status effects
[3:43:55] <%worldbrand> Because I thought it just meant it affects your character
[3:43:59] <%malacante> I was so confused when I got effect spread slow, i though my game was bugged because all the legions were slowing
[3:44:00] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat What are you trying to figure out? Tell me and I'll google it and try to figure it out.
[3:44:00] <%Shadicara> It does
[3:44:04] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat What is your goal?
[3:44:10] <%NeroInfinite> it's just status effects
[3:44:11] <%Louie_Salmon> What else would it possibly do? Make your chain longer when the chain isn't even there?
[3:44:14] <%Monkeyweed21> just do it later
[3:44:15] <%dekkitout> What's this now about more slots or something?
[3:44:19] <ExpressNode> So you can't unequip abilities and equip back up ones in this game?
[3:44:19] <%InugamiTheHound> why is everyone in the chat complaining about how pat manage his legions on the final video!! xcalAngry
[3:44:20] <%Monkeyweed21> off camera
[3:44:20] <iaraCatunda> what
[3:44:22] <%Ascethetic> stop making it harder for him
[3:44:30] <vVAstrAVv> ive had auroheal spread on sword and it didn't heal without sword eqquiped
[3:44:30] <cassiecagedd> Just get S+ and make chat look like a fool
[3:44:32] <%malacante> lol @ this being the final video
[3:44:33] <%brickwall35> make it harder for him
[3:44:34] <WanderingSwordsman> @AngriestPat effect spread just let the legions abilities remain active when they are not out, it doesn't spread to every legion
[3:44:34] <%BestTeaMaker> LUL
[3:44:36] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> don't forget crit
[3:44:37] <%moogleboy1984> what if you had Attack Up 25% with Effect Spread on all your Legions?
[3:44:39] <%malacante> we have barely started this file
[3:44:41] <al0nem0nster> Hey Pat, Imagine attack up +15's all with effect spread, then you'd have attack up 225
[3:44:42] <%Shadicara> You're thinking about it too hard man
[3:44:43] <iaraCatunda> LUL big strong
[3:44:54] <+OUTheTeam> just take them all off and have nothing DarkMode
[3:45:10] <%NeroInfinite> @angriestpat attack up on everything is fine too less to worry about
[3:45:16] <%Monkeyweed21> dig
[3:45:16] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> 5x15 is 75 tho
[3:45:20] <ammobasket> oh hey mark
[3:45:22] <al0nem0nster> =.=
[3:45:22] <Mendin> Kakashi?!?
[3:45:24] <%brickwall35> chat seems apatBig apatWrong on spread
[3:45:29] <al0nem0nster> yes, but 3 attack up 15's per legion
[3:45:31] <%StaceMcGate> mmmm delicious slow
[3:45:32] <KitsuneManami> these guys SUCK
[3:45:35] <+Maximum_KIX> Effect spread only works when you have that legion equipped i thought
[3:45:36] <%Kiiper> Nah, it's just misunderstandings
[3:45:40] <%Louie_Salmon> @wanderingswordsman Then what the hell does chain extension do with effect spread? Nothing?
[3:45:41] <KitsuneManami> I hate them, their cheap ass stuff
[3:45:50] <+Maximum_KIX> I wanted to do parry and effect spread tsbFeels
[3:45:53] <elbigante> wee woo
[3:45:54] <+HyperCharge_Sam> the only problem with the ranking system is that these super small fights are really hard to S+
[3:45:54] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> What are humans gonna do to your magic ass?
[3:45:56] <Phoenon> WRYYYY
[3:46:01] <%StaceMcGate> S
[3:46:02] <%Kiiper> Effect spread applies the master ability even when the Legion isn't summoned
[3:46:04] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat You'd think being attacked by invisible ghosts would freak them out
[3:46:07] <Sphincter_Spelunker> You beat up those woman. Paige would be proud
[3:46:10] <%Monkeyweed21> use doggo
[3:46:10] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> gotta break out more legions and x-baton modes man
[3:46:12] <ne0bunny> search this area with doggo
[3:46:14] <Sphincter_Spelunker> women even
[3:46:14] <%BestTeaMaker> you got hit, and there wasn't enough time
[3:46:16] <%brickwall35> S for SUCK
[3:46:19] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> basically going too fast and too powerful
[3:46:23] <Phoenon> I don't get what affects ratings most yet, I assume speed and not getting hit like most other of these games
[3:46:25] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> and the children
[3:46:26] <%Kiiper> SO if you have a chain length 3.0m with effect spread and super armor omega, it only applies the chain length
[3:46:28] <%Louie_Salmon> A perfect world
[3:46:31] <jubejube56> This um...
[3:46:34] <%ShaneWhite> Is it bothering you that much Pat
[3:46:38] <%Louie_Salmon> This is great
[3:46:41] <al0nem0nster> gonna miss that damage but okay sure.
[3:46:42] <elbigante> is this the goblins
[3:46:42] <%dekkitout> Solution: "Why don't we take the Attack Ups, and push them somewhere else!?"
[3:46:42] <%brickwall35> Nani?
[3:46:43] <%StaceMcGate> ummm whats going on
[3:46:46] <vVAstrAVv> you broke him you idiots lol
[3:46:48] <%malacante> PERFECTLY BALANCED, AS ALL THINGS SHOULD BE
[3:46:48] <%brickwall35> apatGoblin apatGoblin
[3:46:50] <%BestTeaMaker> LUL
[3:46:52] <%NeroInfinite> OH NO
[3:46:52] <iaraCatunda> oh no
[3:46:56] <%Soul_Intern> OH GOD
[3:47:00] <%Louie_Salmon> Now they're all the same. You did it.
[3:47:00] <%Soul_Intern> EXTREME MIND GOBLINS
[3:47:03] <Caidezes> Congrats chat. You ruined the game for him.
[3:47:03] <%BestTeaMaker> NOW EVERYONE IS THE SAME
[3:47:03] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Get a snack while you can guys
[3:47:05] <pwnhills> It doesn't have to be like this
[3:47:06] <WanderingSwordsman> no, effect spread is for all abilities on that legion
[3:47:07] <%Soul_Intern> WHAT HAVE YOU DONE CHAT
[3:47:09] <al0nem0nster> then again, this is just monster hunter gems.
[3:47:11] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Abort! Abort! The goblins are taking over.
[3:47:11] <iaraCatunda> he snapped, y'all
[3:47:11] <%boxedbit> Squid1 apatGoblin Squid4
[3:47:13] <$TheCrispyBoi> pat...
[3:47:14] <%Starlight_Gamer> okay
[3:47:14] <%StaceMcGate> communist legions
[3:47:16] <%brickwall35> perfect
[3:47:22] <Mendin> Harrison Bergeson'd those slave demons
[3:47:23] <Sphincter_Spelunker> A true red
[3:47:24] <%worldbrand> Now it's perfect and empty, just like the ideal bedroom
[3:47:27] <%malacante> effect spread works the same way legion cleaning does
[3:47:28] <+Zxtole> I'm so happy my chat has backseaters, said no one ever
[3:47:32] <iaraCatunda> BIG GOBLINS
[3:47:33] <%dekkitout> Hey, you call it the same, we call it a handicap
[3:47:35] <vVAstrAVv> just try not having goblins :p
[3:47:44] <%BoboDaHobo> Regret incoming: ETA 25 minutes
[3:47:49] <%Kiiper> @WanderingSwordsman That doesn't make sense, because a subability auto-collect will not effect spread
[3:47:50] <%brickwall35> about time you turned off easy mode
[3:47:51] <%Louie_Salmon> You may not like it, but this is what peak performance looks like.
[3:47:58] <%NeroInfinite> I said it was alright to be all attack up. NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[3:47:59] <+MageInSpanish> heyo whats up nerds
[3:48:02] <%Kyma1020> I’m proud of you Pat, you made the number go down
[3:48:07] <%Monkeyweed21> this is REAL GOBLINY
[3:48:09] <%Shadicara> Just set them up
[3:48:14] <%StaceMcGate> Pat removed all performance-enhancing ability mods from Legions, now competition is fair
[3:48:19] <%Shadicara> all damage all day
[3:48:19] <%malacante> we just saw slow spread; arm legion didn't have it and its attacks slowed anyway
[3:48:25] <+NeonBleu> is he actually planning to play until the end?
[3:48:26] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @MageInSpanish The sky so far, but I'm carrying my shield just in case.
[3:48:27] <WanderingSwordsman> don't know about auto collect since I didn't test it out on it
[3:48:28] <%BestTeaMaker> pat didn't notice, but oh well
[3:48:38] <%dekkitout> @StaceMcGate Is that how communism works?
[3:48:41] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Jezus FUCK these guides are complicated and convoluted... just equip the strongest % you can unless there's something super strong, and keep your legions "clean".
[3:48:43] <%BestTeaMaker> LUL
[3:48:48] <iaraCatunda> auto collect is good af
[3:48:48] <%Louie_Salmon> Nah it's perfect
[3:48:49] <al0nem0nster> So this is just the monster hunter decoration system right?
[3:48:53] <%Capta1n_H3nry> Maybe instead of thinking that they all need to be the same, maybe you could think of it as further speccing into each legion's niche?
[3:48:58] <al0nem0nster> except less convoluted.
[3:49:19] <%arcaderabbit48> This is a really cumbersome system, wow
[3:49:20] <%Kiiper> But also has random slots and effect spread is badly explained
[3:49:21] <WanderingSwordsman> I know that when I didn't have my legion out without effect spread I didn't benefit from the passive skills
[3:49:24] <%BioApple> I just put on the ones that sounded strong and didn't bother trying to remember what had what
[3:49:25] <%doc_ock_rokc> Increase speed for Axe. damage on beast, slow on arm, and go crazy for arrow and sword
[3:49:42] <%Louie_Salmon> @capta1n_h3nry That would be nice, except that all the pieces are random so who's to say he even has something for each niche, and how long it would take to find the best chip for whatever purpose
[3:49:44] <Mendin> Use the 25% on the 4-slotters for efficiency?
[3:50:03] <iaraCatunda> Christ here we go
[3:50:06] <%ShaneWhite> It’s bothering you that much huh Patrick
[3:50:09] <%Shadicara> Big damage
[3:50:15] <%Monkeyweed21> do something else then
[3:50:19] <%Soul_Intern> Jesus
[3:50:23] <cassiecagedd> number go up
[3:50:24] <iaraCatunda> he feeding the goblins tonight huh
[3:50:25] <%Soul_Intern> It never ends
[3:50:26] <%StaceMcGate> this is effect spreads fault
[3:50:34] <Mendin> SMOrc
[3:50:37] <%dekkitout> So why can't you combine the ability cards into higher tier versions of themselves
[3:50:39] <+HyperCharge_Sam> so does this actually work or is chat wrong?
[3:50:42] <al0nem0nster> oh an effect spread on that one,nice.
[3:50:43] <%CherrieVelvet> mind goblins vs chat goblins NotLikeThis
[3:50:43] <MrGremy> pat needs a goblin slayer
[3:50:46] <vVAstrAVv> pat you wont beat the game tonight like this
[3:50:46] <%Louie_Salmon> I think you goblin-less people are the real crazy ones. This is the default state of humanity
[3:50:50] <ScreamLord> The Hypest gameplay on Twitch
[3:50:53] <%Soul_Intern> WHY DO YOU KEEP TELLING HIM WHAT TO DO CHAT
[3:50:55] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> You poor, poor man.
[3:50:55] <$TheCrispyBoi> it's okay, pat
[3:50:57] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Put a supercharger on your 440, a turbo on your B-13, and up the compression on your 351. That'll improve your drag times a bit, but you also want to adjust the suspension to seat the car right on launch.
[3:51:04] <%Kiiper> OH
[3:51:08] <%BestTeaMaker> what
[3:51:10] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Is it additive or cumulative for the boost?
[3:51:13] <liflamor> It would be cool if you could merge all those useless chips to make them better
[3:51:16] <%Kiiper> So it allows the abilties to work when the Legion is gone
[3:51:26] <%Kiiper> Doesn't spread to other legions
[3:51:29] <jubejube56> Man I would laugh if this was just additive
[3:51:33] <al0nem0nster> yeah a warframe esque, fusion upgrade system would be nice.
[3:51:43] <vVAstrAVv> @firearmsinstructor are you TRYING to give him a panic attack
[3:51:47] <%Louie_Salmon> @jubejube56 Even if it is, he still has to make it perfect
[3:51:53] <MrGremy> he is doing scott steiner math
[3:51:59] <%StaceMcGate> @Kiiper where'd you get that from? I'm having different information thrown at me
[3:51:59] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> And don't forget to install a manual valve body on the Torqueflite to improve shift points and timing.
[3:52:03] <Phoenon> Maximum STRONK
[3:52:03] <%Soul_Intern> FINALLY
[3:52:07] <%Soul_Intern> Its over
[3:52:07] <iaraCatunda> do they even have the same attack value to begin with?
[3:52:08] <%Monkeyweed21> fine
[3:52:16] <Mendin> Big Numbos
[3:52:16] <%Starlight_Gamer> well okay
[3:52:20] <%Soul_Intern> apatBig Sip
[3:52:22] <%Monkeyweed21> until File 12
[3:52:22] <al0nem0nster> wonder who designed that part of the game.
[3:52:22] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat They're all multiples of 10 or nicely divide by 5!! :D
[3:52:22] <%Shadicara> Lies
[3:52:24] <%Kiiper> @StaceMcGate pulling from forums and general consensus
[3:52:25] <ScreamLord> Or will you?
[3:52:25] <%BioApple> pat you did it wrong, i won't tell you how but i will intermittently yell at you anyway
[3:52:26] <%dekkitout> But my Legion- is a genetic freak!
[3:52:34] <%Kiiper> And sort of my own testing
[3:52:37] <%ShaneWhite> Holy Crap
[3:52:42] <iaraCatunda> ...unless?
[3:52:43] <%ShaneWhite> Finally
[3:52:43] <%GeneralSCPatton> Subway500 bonus50 The Mind Goblins are evolving into Spirit Orcs, and soon will become Soul Trolls.
[3:52:48] <vVAstrAVv> this is why i call attack ups "ignoring" it
[3:52:49] <%StaceMcGate> @Kiiper welp then my builds are trash in my game then, I thought effect spread affected all my legions
[3:52:56] <%Kiiper> because I know super armour doesn't apply to the player when the legion is not summoned unless I had effect spread on
[3:52:58] <MrGremy> what are the odds of pat winning summer slam?
[3:53:08] <%Soul_Intern> We dont
[3:53:10] <%worldbrand> I really dont!
[3:53:11] <%Monkeyweed21> BIG GOBLINS
[3:53:11] <%Shadicara> apatGoblin
[3:53:12] <Baconrath> mind goblins again D:
[3:53:12] <%Soul_Intern> We dont want to
[3:53:12] <%BestTeaMaker> we really don't
[3:53:14] <%StaceMcGate> Subway100 Subway100 Subway100 bonus30
[3:53:15] <jubejube56> I can't understand it
[3:53:15] <%malacante> it does apply to all legions, it's just worded in a way that sounds like it doesn't
[3:53:18] <%dekkitout> @MrGremy Is Kurt Angle in the mix?
[3:53:21] <Sphincter_Spelunker> We have a pretty good idea. There's plenty of video evidence
[3:53:21] <Mendin> We should probably never show Pat the Warehouse Optimization Simulator, it will destroy him
[3:53:28] <%Lurantis_> This kind of feels like a mental illness
[3:53:28] <vVAstrAVv> im so glad i dont
[3:53:29] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @MrGremy Pretty good as long as he min-maxes every little thing.
[3:53:29] <MrGremy> @dekkitout LUL
[3:53:31] <%joylent_blue> i’m sorry pat
[3:53:33] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> you opened up a new mission with that guy I think
[3:53:35] <iaraCatunda> get well soon pat
[3:53:35] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat I genuinely was just curious as to why there were so many duplicates. Didn't mean for you to redo your whole setup. :|
[3:53:37] <%Soul_Intern> @Lurantis_ It definetly is
[3:53:44] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> since you removed the gas
[3:53:49] <Captain_Aham> change your outfit, youre not a cop anymore
[3:53:53] <%ShaneWhite> apatBig ADD
[3:53:55] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> yeah, that guy.
[3:54:09] <%NeroInfinite> Says you Aham
[3:54:10] <%Kiiper> If you want to play with it, turn on auto heal with effect spread and switch to a different legion
[3:54:16] <%Kiiper> auto heal stops
[3:54:18] <cassiecagedd> Is there something chat isnt hung up on
[3:54:20] <%NeroInfinite> ech autoheal
[3:54:22] <jubejube56> But on the other hand, if none of the abilities are equiped, you can enjoy the combat for 30% longer
[3:54:23] <%StaceMcGate> these guys took me awhile to find, mostly the guy high up places
[3:54:30] <%dekkitout> Now I want a compilation of Pat messing with his build with he steiner math audio in the background
[3:54:31] <vVAstrAVv> if he misses another chest and needs chain length again i will laugh tho
[3:54:33] <%BioApple> apatJpeg
[3:54:45] <Sphincter_Spelunker> "last time"
[3:54:45] <Captain_Aham> the cops tries to kill him, I'd say hes off the force
[3:54:45] <%Soul_Intern> NOOOOOOOOOO
[3:54:46] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> Just...ignore...it...
[3:54:46] <Mendin> oh no
[3:54:46] <%SilvaChariot0133> NotLiekThis
[3:54:48] <%Shadicara> LUL
[3:54:50] <vVAstrAVv> NOOOOOOO
[3:54:52] <%SilvaChariot0133> NotLikeThis
[3:54:53] <%NeroInfinite> oh no
[3:54:53] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @cassiecagedd I just want him to get the best possible times on the quarter mile.
[3:54:55] <$TheCrispyBoi> @AngriestPat nononononono
[3:54:55] <%Soul_Intern> oh my god
[3:54:57] <%Lurantis_> Fucking kill me
[3:54:58] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> Please...for the love of my and your sanity, please ignore.
[3:55:04] <%Kiiper> YOu need to be damaged lmao
[3:55:05] <jubejube56> chat already came to a conclusion about effect spread
[3:55:05] <%Soul_Intern> please NotLikeThis
[3:55:08] <%BestTeaMaker> LUL
[3:55:16] <%BioApple> get hurt for SCIENCE
[3:55:17] <Mendin> Pat workshop this offstream when you have luxury and brainpower
[3:55:18] <%malacante> Im curious about this, it's good science
[3:55:18] <%worldbrand> I kind wanna know but we dont gotta do it here
[3:55:20] <doggieo> do you hve effect spread + legion rush?
[3:55:22] <WanderingSwordsman> just makes you auto heal without the legion being out is all
[3:55:23] <iaraCatunda> NotLikeThis
[3:55:25] <vVAstrAVv> PAT IM SORRY NOW PLAY THE GAME LOL
[3:55:30] <doggieo> you could test with that
[3:55:34] <%dekkitout> This effect spread thing seems pretty damn rad
[3:55:35] <%GeneralSCPatton> MEGA MILK
[3:55:47] <Captain_Aham> punished Howard needs an outfit change to mark the fall
[3:55:47] <%NeroInfinite> Doggo
[3:55:49] <%Shadicara> No test it pat Kappa
[3:55:51] <%Macbutters86> oof
[3:55:52] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Isn't that a hentai brand?
[3:55:52] <%SilvaChariot0133> There is still SO much level left still NotLikeThis
[3:55:58] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat Pat I was wrong about effect spread, sorry for making you question your build
[3:56:06] <%NeroInfinite> ...Yesmegamilk is ahentai brand
[3:56:09] <%NeroInfinite> Kappa
[3:56:11] <%Soul_Intern> @SilvaChariot0133 Well be here for a while
[3:56:13] <%ShaneWhite> Just play the game PT
[3:56:20] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Don't forget that side alley to the right pre-cutscene for the red crystals.
[3:56:21] <vVAstrAVv> LOOK, LOOK. HE WAS WRONG
[3:56:26] <iaraCatunda> "I gotta get hurt" - pat, 2019
[3:56:34] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Good thing is, all the info I shared is valid.
[3:56:54] <%worldbrand> who did he put auto heal on? sword?
[3:56:55] <Mendin> There's a man who woke up to justice
[3:57:07] <iaraCatunda> @worldbrand ye
[3:57:07] <%NeroInfinite> there'shella weird stuffhere
[3:57:25] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat YOU. DID. IT.
[3:57:57] <%Soul_Intern> SO LONG
[3:58:03] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> why pat?
[3:58:03] <%Soul_Intern> ?????????????????/
[3:58:06] <%Meekest> ?
[3:58:14] <%Soul_Intern> OH MY GOD NotLikeThis
[3:58:14] <%StaceMcGate> oh no, I was right
[3:58:17] <+MageShady> BUSTED
[3:58:21] <%Kiiper> Told you
[3:58:22] <%FirearmsInstructor> ??
[3:58:23] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> lol, your advice sucks chat.
[3:58:26] <islandoasis> so is this a chaos legion game after all?
[3:58:31] <%dekkitout> I'm lost what happun
[3:58:31] <Sphincter_Spelunker> but what if that only applies to auto heal? LUL
[3:58:36] <Zebroneath> That's terrible
[3:58:38] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @islandoasis Yes.
[3:58:41] <%Kiiper> @Sphincter_Spelunker STAHP D:
[3:58:42] <islandoasis> nice
[3:58:44] <iaraCatunda> clap cla
[3:58:44] <%NeroInfinite> Yeah auto heal is no good
[3:58:52] <iaraCatunda> clap
[3:58:57] <%Soul_Intern> Hello big boy
[3:58:58] <%GeneralSCPatton> They hoped that the system was super exploitable
[3:59:01] <al0nem0nster> oh well that's a disappoint,
[3:59:12] <%dekkitout> Casual miniboss
[3:59:15] <%StaceMcGate> the boss from the motorcycle chase
[3:59:20] <iaraCatunda> @dekkitout he was testing the ability spread thing
[3:59:22] <Mendin> This went from 0 to Party rather fast
[3:59:29] <%Shadicara> No effect spread is just a misleading name
[3:59:30] <%Kiiper> Dude, if effect spread worked the way everyone wanted it to, it would be so fun and interesting for builds
[3:59:46] <vVAstrAVv> bladewolf you suck lol
[3:59:51] <%doc_ock_rokc> it would also BREAK THE GAME
[3:59:58] <%Kiiper> So?
[4:00:09] <%NeroInfinite> IT's a singleplayer game
[4:00:10] <%Kiiper> Breaking the game is the point of RNG systems like that
[4:00:11] <vVAstrAVv> soooo dont do it?
[4:00:19] <%BioApple> it would actually be less interesting since every legion would have the same tech
[4:00:20] <noobpsyboticus> @kiiper no it wouldn't, it would just make having effect spread optimal
[4:00:20] <%StaceMcGate> @Kiiper I put an item drop rate 18% with effect spread on one my legions and then items dropped all the time, which I why I thought it worked the way I did
[4:00:21] <VJdarkworld> Wait what happened to effect spread?
[4:00:28] <%NeroInfinite> It's not like souls my dude who cares if your build is busted
[4:00:41] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Break the game like Ivan Drago
[4:00:44] <%Kiiper> @StaceMcGate I did the same with a item drop auto collect
[4:00:45] <%dekkitout> Nothing gets my rocks off more than min-maxing rare endgame stat boosts
[4:00:45] <Idon__> lmao axe straight up launched you off
[4:00:46] <%doc_ock_rokc> i don't know I like challenge in my games. Otherwise I would jsut use god mode and play easy
[4:00:48] <%Monkeyweed21> SLAVE REVENGE
[4:00:50] <%Kiiper> Made me rage so hard when I realised
[4:00:54] <%BestTeaMaker> BETRYAL
[4:00:55] <%Kiiper> But I was half wrong still
[4:00:56] <jubejube56> @VJdarkworld he took it off
[4:01:05] <Mendin> That was a hell of a lot of recoil/shake on a laserbeam
[4:01:12] <%Kiiper> because I thought the skill spread only the master skill
[4:01:18] <%SGrim> @AngriestPat it's almost like they're angry slaves who want you to die.
[4:01:22] <%Kiiper> instead it spreads nothing ;_;
[4:01:23] <%StaceMcGate> new types
[4:01:30] <%NeroInfinite> Stupid sexy lizard chimeras
[4:01:30] <Idon__> I really hate how all the enemies have codenames and not real ones, lmao
[4:01:31] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> I'd fuck those too
[4:01:32] <al0nem0nster> oh that was a good one, a speed boost +30 with 2 extra effects.
[4:01:33] <jubejube56> Oh these icey bastards
[4:01:34] <%Shadicara> apatCaw
[4:01:36] <%BestTeaMaker> ice waifus
[4:01:39] <WanderingSwordsman> oh crap, these fuckers
[4:01:40] <$arcielardor> Pat, you ever thought about using chain jump to get out of the way of those beams?
[4:01:41] <%dekkitout> They look like Garuda
[4:01:45] <%FirearmsInstructor> Health
[4:01:46] <iaraCatunda> chain drive is so useless
[4:01:50] <%Kiiper> They are pretty much Garuda lol
[4:01:52] <vVAstrAVv> wat why was the chain yellow
[4:01:52] <Sphincter_Spelunker> icefus
[4:01:53] <+Clik404> Why do these chimeras have such fat tits?
[4:01:57] <VJdarkworld> @jubejube56 i mean like whats deal with it. Does it not work like it describes? D:
[4:01:59] <%Shadicara> apatCaw apatCaw
[4:02:04] <+Proswagonizt> did pat watch the GG trailer?
[4:02:13] <%Soul_Intern> @Clik404 They used to be human once, gues they had fat titties then
[4:02:18] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @Clik404 That's where they store their energy
[4:02:20] <jubejube56> It works like it is described, it just heals a pitiful amount
[4:02:21] <%NeroInfinite> Why wouldn't they have fat tits @Clik404
[4:02:26] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> fo BIG lasers
[4:02:34] <+Clik404> Was the Astral Plane like “Yeah, let’s beef up these milkers some” when it turned them chimera?
[4:02:34] <%SGrim> What if ya mom... Nah, what if YOU ran on bat-ries? PogChamp
[4:02:45] <%Kiiper> @VJdarkworld It only allows the abilities to work when the legion is not summoned.
[4:02:45] <Caidezes> Told you. Game ruined forever.
[4:02:47] <%FirearmsInstructor> What ability stuff?
[4:02:55] <iaraCatunda> 🥺
[4:02:55] <%Soul_Intern> @FirearmsInstructor DONT
[4:02:58] <%StaceMcGate> My world is shattered too, all my legion setups are now trash
[4:02:59] <vVAstrAVv> dont bring it back up lol
[4:03:02] <%Kiiper> Abilities are the worst part of the game 100%
[4:03:03] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @SGrim Do I get tits like these chimeras?
[4:03:04] <Idon__> jesus christ you destroyed em
[4:03:05] <iaraCatunda> 🥺🥺🥺🥺
[4:03:06] <Caidezes> Thanks chat.
[4:03:07] <%dekkitout> Is this why you do an Occam's razor and stack atk
[4:03:08] <%Lurantis_> @firearmsinstructor just don’t worry about it
[4:03:12] <%BioApple> i feel like chat's going to hate me for this but I swear I saw a single +3 from the autoheal during the experiment
[4:03:18] <%Monkeyweed21> Pat's greatest enemy is himself
[4:03:23] <%Shadicara> apatGoblin
[4:03:29] <islandoasis> you died really well, S+ rank dying
[4:03:30] <VJdarkworld> @kiiper ohhh, so when the legion IS summoned the abilities no work? D:
[4:03:31] <%Soul_Intern> @BioApple please NotLikeThis
[4:03:33] <%SGrim> @King_Wolf_Rigger who would I be to say no?
[4:03:34] <Sphincter_Spelunker> @BioApple that was from the one it was equipped on
[4:03:35] <%malacante> I just tested on my own swich and I must admit to being possessed by Crazy Talk
[4:03:43] <%GeneralSCPatton> The Spirit Orcs have broken him
[4:03:47] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @SGrim Then I will run on the batteries.
[4:03:51] <%Kiiper> @VJdarkworld No lmao, normally when a legion is not summoned it's abilities don't proc
[4:03:52] <%worldbrand> He did get healed, but he also still had sword legion equipped, just not active
[4:04:00] <%BioApple> ah
[4:04:09] <%FirearmsInstructor> @GeneralSCPatton neohGoodBoy
[4:04:14] <%worldbrand> Im... not entirely sure what we learned, actually
[4:04:22] <%Kiiper> @VJdarkworld effect spread allows it to work when you don't have them summoned IE. when you are playing as blue cop
[4:04:33] <vVAstrAVv> nothing was learned or gained let it go lol
[4:04:33] <%NeroInfinite> that is A LOT of red matter
[4:04:43] <%Kiiper> But also ONLY applies to the legion it's on
[4:04:50] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @worldbrand We learned that chat is stumbo, and Pat has goblins. Wait, we didn't learn anything... damn
[4:04:57] <%Soul_Intern> @worldbrand That Pat needs to go to a psychiatrist
[4:04:58] <VJdarkworld> @kiiper ok good. Ppl were talking in chat that it wasnt useful so i was confused
[4:05:06] <%Kiiper> It's mainly for passive skills like auto-collect and auto-heal
[4:05:09] <islandoasis> so this game is about a cop in anime detroit?
[4:05:13] <islandoasis> looks neat
[4:05:21] <%Kiiper> Less anime detroit
[4:05:26] <%BestTeaMaker> it's post apocalypse cops
[4:05:27] <islandoasis> ima step out before i gett too spoiled
[4:05:35] <%dekkitout> More like the rest of the world is Detroit
[4:05:38] <%dekkitout> SeriousSloth
[4:05:42] <%worldbrand> damn
[4:05:46] <%Redpointshine> Redpointshine subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! Hey pat whats popping, I still don't know what this game is but I'm glad youre enjoying it
[4:05:48] <%Kiiper> lmao gottim
[4:05:51] <islandoasis> the planet of Detroit
[4:05:57] <vVAstrAVv> its the final stream why would you ever step in lol
[4:06:00] <%BioApple> there are only three guys
[4:06:04] <Mendin> DOGCHILD
[4:06:05] <%ArcanumMBD> dog child?
[4:06:08] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Lappy?
[4:06:08] <%ArcanumMBD> dog child!
[4:06:10] <vVAstrAVv> well "fiiinal""
[4:06:16] <%doc_ock_rokc> Dogman a kojima character?
[4:06:21] <Mendin> ^5 Arcanum
[4:06:25] <islandoasis> wanted to see some gameplay of this, who better than AngriestPat(tm)
[4:06:27] <iaraCatunda> @islandoasis it's also every Platinum game mashed together
[4:06:28] <%StaceMcGate> we're like 2 more streams away from final
[4:06:29] <%BioApple> Dog Hardman
[4:06:29] <%Soul_Intern> He really got his mojo fucked
[4:06:31] <%FirearmsInstructor> Dumpster
[4:06:40] <%Shadicara> No this is the last one guys
[4:06:47] <%NeroInfinite> ah I saw that cykabylat in cyrillic
[4:06:49] <%Kiiper> Pat's actually super good at this game
[4:07:10] <%Kiiper> It's just the game badly explains pretty much everything
[4:07:16] <implied_consent> Why so few viewers?
[4:07:17] <vVAstrAVv> @soul_intern this is his real mojo man
[4:07:17] <ArmoredRevenger> tents in me near the start
[4:07:22] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> hi Mr Patrick
[4:07:22] <Sphincter_Spelunker> You're your own worst enemy
[4:07:24] <%Monkeyweed21> This amazing
[4:07:26] <%BestTeaMaker> LUL
[4:07:28] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat you're honestly a master at the perfect syncs and parry
[4:07:29] <%Soul_Intern> @vVAstrAVv Tragic
[4:07:31] <%Kiiper> apatGoblin
[4:07:34] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat don't worry about it right now
[4:07:39] <%NeroInfinite> You're doing great Pat don't worry.
[4:07:42] <Mendin> Oh and they brought the dog to hang with the gang
[4:07:45] <transporterthesequel> You can do it @AngriestPat defeat the ultimate mind goblin
[4:07:45] <%worldbrand> pat taught me that parries could deflect fireballs
[4:07:46] <%Shadicara> I wanna see you play a game with an actual skill tree now LUL
[4:07:47] <islandoasis> >the old crew is back together
[4:07:55] <islandoasis> j-just like best friends, right?
[4:07:55] <%BioApple> This stream taught me some tech, like the legion sendout into air autobind
[4:07:56] <Idon__> AHAHAHAHA
[4:07:58] <%Soul_Intern> @Shadicara YOU REALLY DONT
[4:08:00] <%Ion_Laser> :D
[4:08:00] <%NeroInfinite> MINUS POINTS
[4:08:01] <%doc_ock_rokc> AHAHAHAHAHA
[4:08:03] <%Kiiper> Yeah, for real the fireball parry surprised me lmao
[4:08:04] <Sphincter_Spelunker> DAMN IT
[4:08:07] <%BestTeaMaker> LUL
[4:08:09] <%NeroInfinite> You found how to do it
[4:08:10] <Idon__> that's so fucking stupid LUL
[4:08:16] <%doc_ock_rokc> that isn't a skill tree...thats a skill bank
[4:08:35] <jubejube56> I've only had a single case in the whole game where I wanted effect spread and that was a post-game slime mission
[4:08:35] <%AnIrishPapaya> Path of Exile would be a nightmare for you
[4:08:48] <%worldbrand> oh yeah that would be straight poison
[4:08:48] <%dekkitout> Unfortunately, not every game let's Pat build like his Amprex with hunmu
[4:08:53] <Idon__> imagine not being able to see the stand
[4:08:55] <%Kiiper> PoE would actually kill Pat
[4:09:00] <%Shadicara> It'd give him an aneurism
[4:09:00] <+Matak98> same
[4:09:01] <Sielas> two???
[4:09:01] <Idon__> guys just randomly dying while you do nothing
[4:09:07] <%NeroInfinite> Same PoE is a fucking nightmare
[4:09:09] <lionmanguy> The goblins win again
[4:09:10] <%StaceMcGate> What's up with Path of Exile?
[4:09:12] <%AnIrishPapaya> Same here, and that skill tree is woof
[4:09:20] <%BioApple> how the heck did you do warframe pat, that game has some of the wonkiest numbers mechanics I've ever seen
[4:09:20] <%Laecerelius> I hated the materia system in PoE. I thought I'd love it because it sounds good but it does not mesh well with random loot.
[4:09:21] <%Kiiper> I get about 30 in before I call PoE
[4:09:24] <%Shadicara> It's a really big skill tree
[4:09:29] <%Monkeyweed21> you shouldve played warframe back when it had skill trees
[4:09:33] <Sielas> guys just steal a streamer's build and copy it
[4:09:34] <%ThatOneGameTester> PoE also made my goblins howl
[4:09:35] <Sielas> it's not hard
[4:09:38] <%NeroInfinite> It's noteven a TREE my dude it's a skill UNIVERSE
[4:09:41] <islandoasis> its like diablo 2 but 'modern'
[4:09:42] <ChaoticDaKiller> it'd be pretty fucked if perfect DIDN'T give S+
[4:09:50] <%Shadicara> Skill galaxy
[4:09:51] <%worldbrand> imagine if FFX's sphere grid were actually complicated and actually consequential
[4:09:52] <Sphincter_Spelunker> speaking of goblins. as pat grabs wet wipes
[4:09:54] <+Zxtole> It's not bad at all once you play a few times, just stick with a common build you can find online until you get your bearings
[4:10:17] <%Kiiper> But then they patch and change everything
[4:10:24] <+Zxtole> Then you go online and find another one
[4:10:26] <%BestTeaMaker> I can hear the panic attack waiting to happen inside pat
[4:10:27] <%worldbrand> there's tons of decision paralysis, especially because you can totally fuck a build in that unlike here
[4:10:28] <%luckysteak> luckysteak subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months, currently on a 8 month streak! Hey Pat! thanks for convincing me to get this game! this is the first platinum game to keep me going. Keep up with the great content
[4:10:28] <Mendin> I'm too lazy to look up the SBFP FFX LP, did Pat run away screaming from the sphere grid?
[4:10:36] <%AnIrishPapaya> How do you do with something more bare bones like Skyrim's skill tree?
[4:10:39] <%BestTeaMaker> pat wasn't in the ffx lp
[4:10:42] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Pat wasn't in ff10
[4:10:43] <Cranky_Construct> The problem with path of exile is unless you're know what you're doing you'll fuck yourself however many levels out
[4:10:45] <+Zxtole> But seriously they don't change that much unless you care about min maxing, I've been playing a Necro for 2 years and every season is basically the same build
[4:10:49] <%Zombrocom> PoE is a lot simpler than it looks
[4:10:51] <%ThatOneGameTester> it was matt and woolie
[4:10:51] <Cranky_Construct> and not even realize it until its too late
[4:10:55] <%dekkitout> All I remember from the FFX lp is Grand Wizard Waka
[4:10:56] <%worldbrand> sphere grid is actually just a tree wrapped into a circle
[4:10:59] <islandoasis> sphere grid is a legit straight line
[4:11:01] <%worldbrand> it barely branches
[4:11:05] <%Zombrocom> You just path to the notables you want it's easy
[4:11:06] <%Laecerelius> I remember the Sphere Grid being mostly a straight path
[4:11:07] <vVAstrAVv> if i have to be told how to play a game before i play it fuck it i wont play. fuck looking up builds
[4:11:12] <%ThatOneGameTester> Grand Wizard wakka was a gift from that LP
[4:11:14] <LandOfTheWay> that new GG trailer looks fucking good; wish it showed some UI tho
[4:11:14] <ExpressNode> It's pretty linear until late game
[4:11:15] <%doc_ock_rokc> So do you hate skill trees that shut off branches when you chose an option @AngriestPat ?
[4:11:18] <austinj24> THE RACE WAR STARTS NOOOOW
[4:11:24] <%arcaderabbit48> Sphere Grid is a straight line disguised as something more complex
[4:11:24] <%Laecerelius> With a few branches off for later when you wanted to learn another character's skills
[4:11:26] <%BestTeaMaker> when is grand wizard wakka gonna appear in astral chain
[4:11:27] <butthurtdave> it doesnt matter what your name is!
[4:11:27] <%Soul_Intern> ???
[4:11:28] <iaraCatunda> @landoftheway GG?
[4:11:30] <%Soul_Intern> Ok bro
[4:11:32] <Sphincter_Spelunker> I never finished Demons' Souls for that exact reason
[4:11:33] <%Zombrocom> Nah the tree is misleading, you just find the notables you want and follow the path to them
[4:11:33] <%Shadicara> Get kicked
[4:11:34] <Sielas> @AngriestPat just steal a meta build
[4:11:36] <%StaceMcGate> Tapeworms inc
[4:11:36] <%BestTeaMaker> LUL
[4:11:37] <LandOfTheWay> @iaraCatunda guilty gear
[4:11:41] <%BestTeaMaker> just let him kick you
[4:11:42] <%Soul_Intern> Get your shit pushed in
[4:11:43] <%catastrophecorvid> @AngriestPat POE is just Sphere grid on steroid.
[4:11:45] <iaraCatunda> ooooooh
[4:11:47] <+Zxtole> You don't have to look up builds either, you just wont push as hard as min maxed builds
[4:11:48] <islandoasis> man, they really went ham on the Guyver inspiration on these designs
[4:11:48] <%luckysteak> how much of an emmerich is this hal?
[4:11:54] <%doc_ock_rokc> Darksouls
[4:11:56] <+Zxtole> Pick the systems you want to engage with
[4:11:57] <jubejube56> Like dark souls!
[4:11:57] <%arcaderabbit48> Yeah
[4:12:02] <+Matak98> yes i agree with thta so much
[4:12:02] <Baconrath> fuck the meta
[4:12:02] <%dekkitout> GRABBOID!
[4:12:02] <%malacante> a failure of the game designer?
[4:12:02] <Caidezes> Warframe though.
[4:12:03] <%worldbrand> i concur
[4:12:04] <%Soul_Intern> So Dark souls!!!
[4:12:05] <al0nem0nster> depends on if it was explained in game and ignored by player.
[4:12:06] <Mendin> Is that a Kyriaki?
[4:12:07] <+pjkmgs> dark souls teaches you literally all of the mechanics lol
[4:12:07] <%Starlight_Gamer> agreed
[4:12:10] <%BestTeaMaker> @AngriestPat but you did that with warframe
[4:12:11] <%Soul_Intern> And Warframe!!!
[4:12:11] <Valdorick> Sphere grid only gets fucky if go for clearing low stats and shit.
[4:12:12] <%dekkitout> Hail
[4:12:15] <%linSP> thats every game pat
[4:12:17] <islandoasis> yeah, dark souls is terrible
[4:12:18] <%WackyGear> big ugly
[4:12:18] <%catastrophecorvid> HAIL HYDRA
[4:12:18] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat Darksouls, Warframe, Destiny...
[4:12:18] <%arcaderabbit48> Why si everyone screaming Dark Souls in the chat?
[4:12:19] <%Ion_Laser> PogChamp
[4:12:19] <%BestTeaMaker> FACE WORM
[4:12:20] <ChaoticDaKiller> OH MY GOD IT HAD A HEAD IN ITS MOUTH
[4:12:20] <%worldbrand> yeah and it's a common complaint about warframe
[4:12:21] <jubejube56> Oh god the serpents, why do they kill you in 3 hits?!
[4:12:24] <iaraCatunda> I mean I had to be told how to play bloodborne and darksouls but they're still good games
[4:12:24] <kehnimentu> oh god it has a head in it's mouth
[4:12:27] <+Zxtole> But you don't have too! You can make your own build and easily beat the game and push most content
[4:12:27] <VJdarkworld> Dune saintrMonkaS
[4:12:33] <vVAstrAVv> doggo again
[4:12:36] <Valdorick> GYROIDS!?
[4:12:37] <%dekkitout> You can't fool me anime, that's a mf Graboid
[4:12:37] <vVAstrAVv> and iris
[4:12:39] <%Ascethetic> @AngriestPat beast
[4:12:42] <%Laecerelius> I didn't mind Grim Dawn's skill tree and constellation system because it was easy to respec
[4:12:48] <%doc_ock_rokc> is this....STREET SHARKS
[4:12:49] <al0nem0nster> redshifted tape worms?
[4:12:50] <+pjkmgs> ???? dark souls literally is developed to teach you how to play to game get gud
[4:12:50] <%worldbrand> i actually dont understand why DS is being mentioned because the magic of that game disappears once you understand the meta. unless you really like pvp i guess
[4:12:51] <%FirearmsInstructor> GRABOID!!
[4:12:54] <%BestTeaMaker> use doggo
[4:12:56] <Baconrath> if you walk without rhythm you wont attract the worm
[4:12:57] <islandoasis> when is pat gonna stream the La Mulanas and be told how to play the game at every second puzzle
[4:12:59] <%Kiiper> Warframe has that problem in spades, but as long as you don't go above 80 or hunt eidolons your can use literally any frame/weapon combo
[4:13:02] <%Divryne> User doggo
[4:13:05] <Sielas> @AngriestPat the game's tutorialisation has gotten super in-depth since the last expansion. doesn't help you make a build from the ground up tho
[4:13:08] <islandoasis> not like i had to, haha...
[4:13:22] <%TheHypestCripple> TheHypestCripple subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 22 months! It's nice of Twitch to let me know I've been using a parasocial relationship to distract me from my slow descent into insanity for all of 22 months!
[4:13:23] <Sielas> MAI WIFE
[4:13:27] <%arcaderabbit48> @Laecerelius I was pleasantly surprised by Grim Dawn, but I wish it didnt look so daunting the first tiem you see it
[4:13:29] <%worldbrand> La Mulana is a great game for fucked up people
[4:13:30] <Sphincter_Spelunker> your wife's not hot? how tragic
[4:13:30] <%StaceMcGate> new red cases are available!
[4:13:31] <%Soul_Intern> Still, fuck you dude
[4:13:33] <jubejube56> IRIS/mini map can be used to see serpents underground, then you can use doggo to dig them up for a free stun
[4:13:34] <%dekkitout> I wonder if a Graboid would lose its mind if it was put underground in a city...
[4:13:43] <%Laecerelius> Yeah, Grim Dawn looks a lot scarier than it is
[4:13:51] <%Soul_Intern> I mean fair, but still fuck you
[4:13:57] <%Capta1n_H3nry> 600%?!
[4:13:58] <%doc_ock_rokc> @dekkitout it probablly would do a lot of damage
[4:14:00] <+nekodelic> @angriestpat how do you enjoy creating a deck in a card game?
[4:14:01] <%Kiiper> Really Jube? that would have been handy in a file 12 mission D:
[4:14:03] <%Monkeyweed21> thats what you get for stacking damage
[4:14:04] <%BestTeaMaker> A for ass
[4:14:09] <%Laecerelius> But once I found out that respeccing was super cheap I started experimenting and had a lot of fun
[4:14:09] <%Capta1n_H3nry> On a self-destruct?!
[4:14:10] <butthurtdave> WHOAH OH
[4:14:11] <Shadope342> whoa oh oh
[4:14:11] <%FirearmsInstructor> These delayed subtitles are messing with my head, but I understand and appreciate *why* they did it the way they did. Makes sense.
[4:14:13] <islandoasis> S for Suck
[4:14:18] <%doc_ock_rokc> POPALA
[4:14:19] <+Zxtole> Like I said earlier, just engage with the systems you want too
[4:14:19] <vVAstrAVv> eww card games lol
[4:14:20] <stingray53_1> which file is this?
[4:14:21] <%Soul_Intern> OLIVE?
[4:14:22] <Sphincter_Spelunker> thicc
[4:14:26] <%StaceMcGate> no time Olive, sidequests!
[4:14:27] <ravencloak13> The subtitles are delayed?
[4:14:29] <jubejube56> Lol I had to learn how to deal with the serpents properly 30 missions into file 12
[4:14:29] <%ThatOneGameTester> i make up bullshit
[4:14:34] <islandoasis> you build decks for maximum FUN
[4:14:35] <Twoiis> netdecking
[4:14:36] <stingray53_1> oh no
[4:14:37] <%Soul_Intern> OH NO
[4:14:46] <%ShaneWhite> So no YuGiOh for you
[4:14:46] <VJdarkworld> @firearmsinstructor you can disable it if ya want luckily
[4:14:50] <%Soul_Intern> OLIVE NO
[4:14:50] <%Ascethetic> @AngriestPat oh hey, the Boss Coffee with milk is the best
[4:14:51] <%WackyGear> @AngriestPat what dickery do you think the commander is up to now?
[4:14:56] <%Ion_Laser> Olive NO
[4:15:00] <+nekodelic> yugioh would be absolute hell then
[4:15:02] <%arcaderabbit48> @Laecerelius Absolutely. Grim Dawn would be a very different game if they didn't give you essentially free respecs
[4:15:05] <%Zombrocom> filithy netdecker Kappa
[4:15:07] <Caidezes> How are people still surprised by Pat's goblins?
[4:15:07] <%FirearmsInstructor> @VJdarkworld yea I prefer em, but it's tweaky.
[4:15:09] <stingray53_1> he's probably not finishing this tonight
[4:15:12] <+Zxtole> Isn't looking up a build in PoE netdecking? It's fun to play unique and interesting builds
[4:15:12] <%Lurantis_> Is this game any good? I’ve heard good things, but pat sounds and looks miserable
[4:15:13] <Sokumotanaka> WTF IS OLIVE GONNA DO!?
[4:15:13] <Baconrath> if only i could make a deck out of nothing but Goldshire Footman Kappa
[4:15:16] <%doc_ock_rokc> I don't like card games ether...mostly because I grew up poor and could neer get card packs
[4:15:21] <%Louie_Salmon> But there's always the best cards, and you just put the best cards in. Like that's actually totally different
[4:15:23] <%NeroInfinite> I just put whatever cards do good stuff into my decks sometiems it work sometimes itnow ork.
[4:15:23] <%BioApple> @Lurantis_ that's our fault, game is '''c
[4:15:24] <vVAstrAVv> fyi you dont have to stay far away from olive its not forced prog
[4:15:28] <%FirearmsInstructor> @VJdarkworld obviously can't do anything about it through Pat's stream lol
[4:15:29] <+conradical> i'm totally with you on that, pat
[4:15:31] <%BestTeaMaker> TIME FOR OLIVE TO SAVE THE DAY
[4:15:31] <%Zombrocom> @Lurantis_ Pats misery has little to nothing to do with the game
[4:15:35] <transporterthesequel> Building a deck is all about lowering that variability to the smallest manageable number
[4:15:35] <%Soul_Intern> @Lurantis_ Thats entirely on him, the game is great
[4:15:37] <%arcaderabbit48> @Lurantis_ The game is great and he loves it, this is mostly just the mind goblins attacking him.
[4:15:37] <islandoasis> Throne of Eldraine out soon
[4:15:42] <%Lurantis_> tytyty
[4:15:43] <%CrypticMochi> All about themes or optimizing win cons
[4:15:44] <VJdarkworld> @firearmsinstructor 😅😅
[4:15:44] <%PauliusMaximus> tcgs/ccgs are the only kind of game i have an active hate towards
[4:15:46] <Sielas> Half the fun of PoE is learning, the other half is GETTING PAID
[4:15:47] <ChaoticDaKiller> this was The American Healthcare System
[4:15:47] <%StaceMcGate> Demon jesus curing the lepers
[4:15:50] <%malacante> I play a ton of mtg and I can't make non-netdecks
[4:15:52] <%Laecerelius> For me deck building, at least with Magic the Gathering, is mostly about finding the mechanic you really like and then building around that.
[4:15:57] <%Louie_Salmon> I have a lot of goblins, but card games do not anger any of my goblins
[4:15:57] <%malacante> it's like, too hard for no reward
[4:15:58] <Sphincter_Spelunker> @Lurantis_ it's goblins. he's been having fun for over 5 streams now and its all crashing down that he might not have been optimized
[4:16:02] <%Soul_Intern> @ChaoticDaKiller "Was" LUL
[4:16:05] <%dekkitout> Hugs do fix everything
[4:16:08] <transporterthesequel> Cop Jesus CONFIRMED
[4:16:09] <butthurtdave> i cant play card games against real people anymore it's too expensive and the huge luck factor destroyed my adult brain, i miss being a stupid kid with money to burn
[4:16:10] <ravencloak13> Now beat up the dealer. And take his money.
[4:16:11] <%NeroInfinite> Goblins in MTG are my fav mechanic
[4:16:18] <%BestTeaMaker> tbh, to them it is a miracle since they can't see stands
[4:16:26] <%SirFancySwank> jesus touch
[4:16:26] <Valdorick> Are you Omnijesus?
[4:16:27] <%Lurantis_> @sphincter_spelunker the added 2% efficiency is VITAL apatSmug
[4:16:30] <%Shadicara> Min max goblins
[4:16:30] <%Niney_Who> apatBig 3
[4:16:31] <%StaceMcGate> this red case confused me at first
[4:16:33] <%DeathsDoom> CAR PUZZLES
[4:16:33] <al0nem0nster> the hype will come back when he unlocks devil trigger
[4:16:33] <Valdorick> Astral Jesus

[4:16:45] <%Soul_Intern> SQUIRREL
[4:16:46] <%worldbrand> What if I told you that your choice of real life footwear is making you 3% slower?
[4:16:46] <%Monkeyweed21> IS THAT A TANUKI
[4:16:47] <islandoasis> goblins and dwarves do have some bad history

[4:16:58] <%Shadicara> ANIME
[4:16:58] <GuilKato> @AngriestPat you need to watch Goblin Slayer - learn to slay those brain goblins
[4:16:59] <WanderingSwordsman> still not done yet with side content
[4:17:01] <%Black_Machete> this is new to me
[4:17:03] <Valdorick> Tame it. Tame that fucker.
[4:17:03] <%NeroInfinite> ah the tankui legion with it's GIANT BALLS
[4:17:04] <+Zxtole> Pat's suffering from overchoice, it's sadly a natural brain process that you can have mindfully fight in order to deal with it
[4:17:07] <vVAstrAVv> was he trying to blame me?
[4:17:10] <%doc_ock_rokc> ALL YO YENS YIP YIP YAP!
[4:17:10] <Sielas> Hello my new waifu

[4:17:15] <%AnIrishPapaya> I Am Legion? Don't kill the pupper
[4:17:15] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat It's hilarious... if people can't see Legions and you're just straddling an invisible creature, riding around on nothing at like 20 MPH. xD
[4:17:17] <%SirFancySwank> even more enemy types wow
[4:17:17] <Sokumotanaka> @AngriestPat Hey pat when you gonna say yolo and do FO: NV dead money on stream so I can see you get mad?

[4:17:52] <al0nem0nster> oh too bad, those DLC are fantastic
[4:18:01] <transporterthesequel> KiLL MAGIC CLOUD
[4:18:03] <ravencloak13> Oh great, they are going to explain that mythology was just fucking Chimera’s.
[4:18:03] <islandoasis> well, the tribal one was shit
[4:18:06] <%InugamiTheHound> @AngriestPat what about fallout 4? At least the base game?
[4:18:08] <islandoasis> what was it called
[4:18:14] <Valdorick> Those DLC are amazing; minus dead money.
[4:18:15] <%Lurantis_> Old world blues and honest hearts were the only good ones apatDab
[4:18:16] <Sokumotanaka> @islandoasis You rite

[4:18:36] <ravencloak13> Oh Honest Hearts.
[4:18:37] <butthurtdave> The DLCs are great but there's so much stuff to play and having to pick back up a save file from like 5 months ago is hard as hell to do
[4:18:37] <%Monkeyweed21> if you do F4 just do Far Harbor
[4:18:37] <%GeneralSCPatton> Another settlement needs your help
[4:18:41] <%malacante> did you hear the theory that this is a NIER:A sequel and everything is data because they're in the Ark?

[4:24:27] <islandoasis> i cant believe you are summoning a bunch of guyvers
[4:24:28] <al0nem0nster> you just native american rope toy swords between the two of you
[4:24:28] <%BestTeaMaker> triple sword is chain ping pong
[4:24:30] <%BioApple> pat sneezes like a muppet
[4:24:31] <%dekkitout> Well that looks neat, you get to play catch with Sword-kun, too bad for anyone who gets in your way however
[4:24:32] <%NeroInfinite> You just shoot swords now I guess
[4:24:32] <ravencloak13> That’s a good skill.
[4:24:33] <jubejube56> This is really good for using many sync points which is important for .....reasons
[4:24:34] <%BestTeaMaker> it's very weird
[4:24:36] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> It goes on longer with actual enemies
[4:24:41] <ShichiNoBushi> Moves along the chain.
[4:24:46] <ArmoredRevenger> you fucked it
[4:24:46] <%worldbrand> Oh that's cool actually
[4:24:47] <%NeroInfinite> It's basically pignpong
[4:24:48] <Sphincter_Spelunker> but why tho

[4:25:01] <%Soul_Intern> THATS SO COOL
[4:25:01] <%Louie_Salmon> Keep the chain long and you can see what it does
[4:25:01] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Ping Pong Murder Machine
[4:25:01] <Mendin> That could get FUCKING BONKERS
[4:25:02] <%StaceMcGate> now that's an exploit
[4:25:03] <ravencloak13> Okay, that’s fucking strong.
[4:25:03] <al0nem0nster> now to see the damage
[4:25:04] <%Shadicara> GOOFY SKILLS
[4:25:04] <%doc_ock_rokc> its a round blade on your chain you can bounce back and forth
[4:25:05] <ChaoticDaKiller> it does more damage the faster it goes
[4:25:05] <%ThatOneGameTester> until it drains all your meter i guess
[4:25:07] <%NeroInfinite> YOu trap anenmey and play ping pong with your legion
[4:25:07] <%Kiiper> Yeah, not turn on auto sync lmao
[4:25:09] <Asuxley> it's pong
[4:25:10] <%dekkitout> Can that stack with the Legion unchain whatsit?
[4:25:17] <cielrayze> play tennis with your legion
[4:25:19] <LorcaNomad> is that just pure juggle tech or nah
[4:25:23] <vVAstrAVv> i wish all skills were that fun
[4:25:26] <WanderingSwordsman> its ping pong, think of it like the magic ball you got to hit back at ganon in LOZ
[4:25:32] <transporterthesequel> That is a BAD SKILL
[4:25:40] <ArmoredRevenger> @angriestpat do you have the baton 360 attacks?

[4:26:10] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat "You can't farm them. They are given to you from orders and missions and sometimes found in crates, on the ground or hidden dig sites, but are one time rewards. You are given a lot more of them in chapter 12 however, so use them as you see fit."

[4:28:40] <al0nem0nster> I wonder, when you fuse with your legion are you invisible to regulars?
[4:28:45] <ravencloak13> She’s not wrong.

[4:30:48] <jubejube56> Its just the area from 2 missions ago
[4:30:48] <Valdorick> Thank god they put arrows on their own secret hide out. Don't want the cultists getting lost.
[4:30:50] <VJdarkworld> (Second to Last Stream)
[4:30:54] <%Kiiper> It's the cleanup map from file 8 lmao
[4:31:00] <Mendin> Pat you ju st murdered that man

[4:31:30] <%dekkitout> We specialize in the best of 'git fuk'd'
[4:31:31] <ChaoticDaKiller> Gravity storm is pretty fantastic against most enemies
[4:31:35] <%Soul_Intern> OH
[4:31:36] <%arcaderabbit48> So now that we have another new Guilty Gear game, does this mean we have to sit through 3 more years of "When Baiken?"
[4:31:36] <Zebroneath> It's hard to believe you are knocking these people out with your stand powers
[4:31:38] <%Soul_Intern> OH YEAH?
[4:31:40] <Idon__> bro, did you just taunt the guy with a STAND
[4:31:41] <%Capta1n_H3nry> Are there hermit hideouts in other levels then?
[4:31:41] <vVAstrAVv> its basically a character action staple in general
[4:31:41] <%InugamiTheHound> killing the hermits helps clean up our gene pool /sarcasm
[4:31:42] <%doc_ock_rokc> pat got butthurt
[4:31:43] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> I think people don't survive when they are pulled into an event horizon. could be wrong though.
[4:31:43] <ravencloak13> ...I thought he sucked them in a black hole and they were just gone for a second.
[4:31:49] <%Starlight_Gamer> brenda mission still a thing?
[4:31:49] <islandoasis> pat you might as well test the pingpong here
[4:32:00] <Idon__> it's a TRAPPU
[4:32:02] <AwesomeDan_> brenda is taking a backseat to the hermits
[4:32:06] <%Big_King_Coconut> @King_Wolf_Rigger nah it's fine, happens to me all the time
[4:32:09] <%Soul_Intern> YEYEYYEYEYEYEYEYEYYE
[4:32:12] <%BioApple> hadogken
[4:32:14] <Sphincter_Spelunker> maximum beast legion
[4:32:14] <Mendin> MAXIMUM PUPPER
[4:32:17] <Valdorick> THAT'S RAD
[4:32:21] <$Tarcanist_> is astral chain fun to play? when i saw the trailer for it, i was turned off, because of the anime art style and goofy looking anime costumes. @angriestpat
[4:32:30] <ravencloak13> @inugamithehound I know it’s sarcasm but we don’t have a lot of humans left. The gene pools already been clean.
[4:32:40] <Mendin> @Tarcanist_ It's a PLATINUM game
[4:32:40] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @Big_King_Coconut Good to know. Now I can unleash my new creation without remorse.
[4:32:42] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Tarcanist_ its a platnum game....its usually fun to play
[4:32:49] <%InugamiTheHound> why can't our doggo look like cool fox demon box from earlier
[4:32:49] <%Laecerelius> Sweeped the leg!
[4:32:52] <islandoasis> naw, its lame
[4:32:55] <AllenDeadman> get his toes
[4:32:59] <%FirearmsInstructor> @BioApple your sub-eyeball is SUPER grody D:
[4:33:00] <VJdarkworld> glasses :O
[4:33:02] <Sphincter_Spelunker> uh oh, don't crazy talk platinum
[4:33:03] <auspiciousdgg> Is that a Blade Wolf stand?
[4:33:04] <islandoasis> platinum lost its luster at korra
[4:33:05] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> That's... not true.
[4:33:06] <8_Bit_Badger> Is that their actual slogan at platinum
[4:33:11] <%Shadicara> If you don't like the anime style don't get it because it doesn't change LUL
[4:33:11] <%InugamiTheHound> boss not box sorry
[4:33:13] <vVAstrAVv> @tarcanist_ if you dont like how anime this game is youll probably hate it fun or not man
[4:33:13] <%arcaderabbit48> Except that one time it fell int he sewer and some turtles found it. But aside form that!
[4:33:14] <islandoasis> korra is the peak of plat games
[4:33:18] <%NeroInfinite> It is there slogan
[4:33:18] <+Slowpoking> What chapter are you on?
[4:33:18] <%BioApple> @FirearmsInstructor I've been staring for 27 months, like that guy on fridge duty
[4:33:20] <%Kiiper> Korra was passable
[4:33:23] <islandoasis> kek
[4:33:26] <ravencloak13> @auspiciousdgg It has a lot of Blade Wolfs moves yeah. You can also ride it.
[4:33:26] <%StaceMcGate> These characters are not the best they've ever written however
[4:33:28] <ne0bunny> @AngriestPat look up at pipe in that middle hermits area
[4:33:30] <islandoasis> i didnt even play it
[4:33:31] <8_Bit_Badger> That's a pretty dang cool slogan
[4:33:31] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Gold is the only metal that doesn't oxide.
[4:33:33] <%doc_ock_rokc> @islandoasis plat built that in like 3 months
[4:33:33] <%NeroInfinite> Korra aside...
[4:33:34] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Gotta get some eyedrops. Remember to blink, etc. ;)
[4:33:39] <vVAstrAVv> i actually like korra lol
[4:33:40] <ravencloak13> @stacemcgate Doesn’t matter.
[4:33:48] <%Starlight_Gamer> never played korra
[4:33:50] <+Slowpoking> Chapter 11 isn't that long
[4:33:51] <%Louie_Salmon> TMNT was rushed, Korra and Transformers were cool
[4:33:51] <%cereal_box_conspiracy> I'm in the middle of Chapter 11 myself. I've lost everything.
[4:33:54] <Onmi_Khaos> Hey remember when you planned to play FF7?
[4:33:59] <%BioApple> 11 is like a normal length for a level
[4:34:01] <%Capta1n_H3nry> Sphere Hunter Suzi is based
[4:34:01] <islandoasis> wow, for a 3 month game, that looked really passable
[4:34:01] <%NeroInfinite> It wasn't great
[4:34:04] <%Monkeyweed21> STEALTH TIME
[4:34:06] <%StaceMcGate> @ravencloak13 ehh, it's a story focused game and in the past they've made quirky/memorable characters
[4:34:07] <Onmi_Khaos> Days gone, distant memories
[4:34:09] <%SilvaChariot0133> Nah, this is doable in one more stream ez
[4:34:21] <%InugamiTheHound> is this a sneaking mission?
[4:34:25] <Bloodhit> Is that russian text on the wall?
[4:34:29] <VJdarkworld> Astral Chain vs. Sleep
[4:34:31] <%Kiiper> Yes
[4:34:32] <Onmi_Khaos> So wait
[4:34:34] <+Slowpoking> Oh yeah now I know where you are. I just never found that Hermit area so I was lost
[4:34:41] <%Kiiper> The slums have russian everywhere

[4:36:39] <islandoasis> WAT AM I FIGHTING FOR
[4:36:39] <vVAstrAVv> @anirishpapaya you should make your own decisions man
[4:37:06] <vVAstrAVv> idk why we cant mute iris
[4:37:08] <%GeneralSCPatton> The officer have started to move
[4:37:08] <%BlueMoonBlues> big smarts
[4:37:13] <auspiciousdgg> very clever use of your stand
[4:37:14] <%AnIrishPapaya> I just feel like on release that game's going to shit the bed
[4:37:23] <islandoasis> too smart for stealth
[4:37:28] <%InugamiTheHound> IRIS!!!
[4:37:43] <%StaceMcGate> more bosses
[4:37:48] <8_Bit_Badger> If your stand is invisible just make it vore you and carry you to the end of the level duh
[4:37:55] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Brenda will be fine. kbai
[4:38:03] <islandoasis> iris: i dream of a world of only legions
[4:38:12] <+Slowpoking> @8_Bit_Badger But then they'd just see a floating police officer
[4:38:12] <%Soul_Intern> USE ARM BOI
[4:38:12] <%dekkitout> Holy crowd control, Batman
[4:38:14] <%Soul_Intern> YEYYEYEYEYEYYE
[4:38:27] <%dekkitout> Lucky Ted lucky?
[4:38:33] <%StaceMcGate> sbfpYeyeye sbfpYeyeye
[4:38:38] <8_Bit_Badger> @Slowpoking This is the "can you see the invisible man's pee inside him" argument all over again
[4:38:40] <Onmi_Khaos> Can you not chain "Finish Off" like you could in Revengeance?
[4:38:56] <vVAstrAVv> dog on dog? thats heartless lol
[4:39:08] <islandoasis> that dog is cool, BUT can it do an azuna drop?
[4:39:14] <Onmi_Khaos> IZUNA
[4:39:17] <ravencloak13> It can actually.
[4:39:19] <%FirearmsInstructor> It's like really long nun-chucks... except you have a demon dog / Legion on the end of the chain that you're slapping against people rofl
[4:39:21] <islandoasis> nice
[4:39:21] <8_Bit_Badger> Glad to see blade wolf getting his own game
[4:39:25] <Sphincter_Spelunker> of course it's heartless. he's pulling their hearts out
[4:39:34] <KitsuneManami> Balls EXPOSED
[4:39:37] <%MoraMiarty> I dont get axe legion
[4:39:45] <islandoasis> the okami is real

[4:39:50] <%BioApple> what does waiting for the sync flash in the finish off do?
[4:39:51] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Heartless? THE DARKNESS!
[4:39:57] <islandoasis> dorkness
[4:40:00] <Onmi_Khaos> Has Pat Finally figured out how to fight the big guys?
[4:40:07] <ravencloak13> Axe is high defense and meaty hits.
[4:40:19] <%doc_ock_rokc> Okami is the Novermber rain of videogames
[4:40:21] <+Slowpoking> @MoraMiarty It's principally used for defense with lots of shield options, but it also deals huge single-burst damage and can trap enemies with explosives
[4:40:27] <ChaoticDaKiller> Big guys are pretty weak against blue shield and axe
[4:40:27] <%StaceMcGate> and all the guards respawn
[4:40:34] <%FirearmsInstructor> Rank?
[4:40:35] <ravencloak13> Also spin to win move.
[4:40:37] <%Monkeyweed21> chest behind you
[4:40:40] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @doc_ock_rokc The fact that I get that, makes me feel so old.
[4:40:41] <+lordsdb> he got a S+
[4:40:43] <+OUTheTeam> axe is so good against big enemies just cant hit beast bosses for shit

[4:45:25] <@lewdskeletor13> Isn’t Tim Hortons exclusive to America
[4:45:28] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @ravencloak13 Sure, but if an invisible force just started shoving me around I wouldn't be going "Hm?" I'd be flippping my goddam gourd lol.
[4:45:29] <%ShaneWhite> Chick Fil A
[4:45:32] <%SilvaChariot0133> Oh man Whataburger
[4:45:36] <%dekkitout> Next you're gonna tell me Tim Horton's is Canadian Kappa

[4:45:46] <KitsuneManami> Wendy's is great
[4:45:47] <ShimmerFairy> Next you're gonna tell me maple syrup is Canadian and not American.
[4:45:48] <al0nem0nster> Wendy's began on November 15, 1969, when the company's founder, Dave Thomas, opened his first restaurant. It was located at 257 East Broad Street, in Columbus, Ohio.
[4:45:51] <BlacSoul> Thats why Shes so snarky
[4:45:51] <ravencloak13> @king_wolf_rigger Eh, they are police.
[4:45:52] <8_Bit_Badger> Wendy's was founded in ohio
[4:45:52] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Save the orphans
[4:45:54] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Yea. That's true. I donated to their charity in 2018. They're super crazy about adoption.
[4:45:57] <%worldbrand> Wendy's dave thomas's wiki doesn't mention canada at all
[4:45:57] <%InugamiTheHound> he was born in New jersey. Yeah Dave Thomas was orphan and he helped make KCF and then later on Wendy's
[4:45:59] <%doc_ock_rokc> Thats why we let Jena blow up a few orphaniges
[4:45:59] <%Monkeyweed21> create orphans to help them
[4:46:00] <arkv01> save the shounen protagonists
[4:46:00] <KitsuneManami> @AngriestPat tell Paige to get a Daves Burger with only cheese and mustard
[4:46:03] <@lewdskeletor13> Wendy’s wants to form the Orphan Gang from Plagues Tale

[4:46:08] <%Dakuu75> Wendy's was created by an ORPHAN~! Man I'm never eating THERE again
[4:46:09] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> Didn't their money also go to Trump's super-pac?
[4:46:12] <%BioApple> pat is appropriating american fast food culture
[4:46:15] <%miguelrod777> wendys food food is good but i dont like how much grease it has
[4:46:17] <%Laecerelius> Pat doesn't accept facts and logic!
[4:46:17] <%doc_ock_rokc> Ohio is pretty canadian
[4:46:18] <%ThatOneGameTester> Hawaiian pizza was also a Canadian creation.
[4:46:20] <+Slowpoking> I reject your reality and substitute my own
[4:46:21] <%rumtumtugnutz> Wendy's Dave was from Newj Esrey.
[4:46:22] <%GeneralSCPatton> Gotta feed the orphans, to the children, Mr. Heart!
[4:46:28] <%king_wragles> @lewdskeletor13 Wawa is exclusive to the states tho, and they're BETTER THAN SHEETZ

[4:46:40] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @ravencloak13 Are you insinuating that cops deal with the phantasmal on a regular basis and are thusly less perturbed by said presence?
[4:46:43] <@lewdskeletor13> So wait was Pat wrong about the Wendy’s man
[4:46:43] <ravencloak13> I like Wendy’s mascot being meme’d into a shit lord. That’s fun. Smug Wendy’s great.

[4:48:27] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @ravencloak13 Fair enough, but wouldn't that mean that they know what's going on and would react violently to what they assume is a preternatural force?

[4:50:16] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @ravencloak13 But they would know that something is there since they deal with that shit. And they know that chimera are invisible. And that chimera are the bane of humanity. So the response would be aggressive action while calling in the location.
[4:50:25] <%NeroInfinite> IT's a weird goat seal thing
[4:50:30] <%rumtumtugnutz> Good cause that shit is DELIGHTFUL

[4:53:24] <%InugamiTheHound> LUL
[4:53:25] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> OH GOD. Almost as bad as that time I used a grinder.
[4:53:26] <%ToadKing> if you're not a coward
[4:53:27] <Cranky_Construct> listen man, sometimes you need a dry clean
[4:53:32] <Cranky_Construct> that ends in a bleed
[4:53:33] <arkv01> sometimes the anal folds need smoothing out
[4:53:34] <8_Bit_Badger> You'll have an extra smooth anus
[4:53:35] <%worldbrand> it's called exfoliating
[4:53:37] <%doc_ock_rokc> Caught instantly
[4:53:39] <%NeroInfinite> NEVER USE SAND PAPER TO WIPE
[4:53:44] <al0nem0nster> Raven officers.
[4:53:45] <+Slowpoking> The other Red Cops
[4:53:47] <ravencloak13> Well, the back side of it as a toilet paper would be fine.
[4:53:47] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Nothing like a wire wheel to get it CLEAN
[4:53:47] <%FirearmsInstructor> @King_Wolf_Rigger angle? ;)
[4:53:48] <%Soul_Intern> THIGH
[4:53:50] <%ThatOneGameTester> @King_Wolf_Rigger an edge grinder?

[4:54:07] <%StaceMcGate> dats a photo
[4:54:13] <%NeroInfinite> The fuck is wrong with you
[4:54:15] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @FirearmsInstructor @ThatOneGameTester Flap disk
[4:54:16] <Idon__> yup, they're dead
[4:54:16] <ChaoticDaKiller> I prefer to wipe my ass with a cheese grater
[4:54:16] <%Laecerelius> Goopy frog boy!
[4:54:17] <ShichiNoBushi> The goo!
[4:54:18] <Sphincter_Spelunker> big zoos
[4:54:20] <arkv01> 🐸
[4:54:20] <RupanSen> you gotta polish you anal folds
[4:54:23] <%GeneralSCPatton> Using sandpaper as TP requires a DC 35 Fort Save to avoid passing out and dying of shock.
[4:54:24] <%WackyGear> @AngriestPat the answer is always the gendou ikari knockoff dicking around
[4:54:25] <Idon__> fuck da PO LICE
[4:54:26] <%AgentOrangeShoes> apatBig B L O B B O
[4:54:31] <DeanX27> Frogs don't give a fuck about the police
[4:54:32] <%StaceMcGate> escort mission
[4:54:32] <%ThatOneGameTester> some people jobs depend on a smooth anal cavity Pat Kappa
[4:54:39] <ravencloak13> They got taken out by a fat boi, not even one of the cooler ones.
[4:54:40] <+lordsdb> Hey how is the population looking cause this is feeling pretty dire
[4:54:41] <+yuppie_water> That thing's like vore the police
[4:54:42] <8_Bit_Badger> Maybe you could poop better and wouldn't have to go to the butt doctor if you had a smoother exit
[4:54:43] <islandoasis> smooth poops require drastic measures
[4:54:44] <Idon__> even you? implying this is something easy?
[4:54:50] <%NeroInfinite> I think armboy might bebetter for thebig blobbo
[4:54:51] <%FirearmsInstructor> @King_Wolf_Rigger wut?
[4:54:54] <ChaoticDaKiller> Only unimportant people get red shifted so this is fine
[4:55:01] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> You'd need at least 500 grit to polish up
[4:55:03] <haisho> wait she can see chimeras
[4:55:12] <ShichiNoBushi> That's neat having Axe guarding Olive.
[4:55:15] <%Soul_Intern> ITS NO USE
[4:55:17] <ravencloak13> Not normal but the worlds going crazy.
[4:55:18] <Sphincter_Spelunker> take this
[4:55:24] <%FirearmsInstructor> @King_Wolf_Rigger nevermind googled it lol
[4:55:24] <%NeroInfinite> oh fuck that cop just DISENTIGRATEd
[4:55:33] <%ArcanumMBD> when redshift gets real bad normal people can see chimeras
[4:55:35] <ravencloak13> Red shift lets normal people see the Chimera.
[4:55:35] <%ThatOneGameTester> lol an angle grinder sure
[4:55:44] <transporterthesequel> It's not cop murder if they're monsters!
[4:55:54] <ShichiNoBushi> @haisho Maybe she has an AR device or something that detects them. The camera apparenlty can photograph chimeras.
[4:55:55] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @FirearmsInstructor Flap disks are sections of sandpaper/scotch brite on a wheel that you can attach to your angle grinder.
[4:55:56] <8_Bit_Badger> Has that crouch button ever been used in this game
[4:55:58] <Idon__> "gotta clean up the trash in the sewer"
[4:55:59] <%Monkeyweed21> SEWER DRUGS
[4:56:00] <%RubberFistFight> omfg fresh pineapple is the fucken beeeeesssst Kreygasm
[4:56:03] <ChaoticDaKiller> just use the medicine you found IN THE SEWER it's fine
[4:56:06] <%doc_ock_rokc> That medicine is expired and has been down here for decaded
[4:56:07] <%BestTeaMaker> yes, you crouch in plenty of places
[4:56:12] <Sphincter_Spelunker> sorry unnamed cops, us named characters have a side quest to complete
[4:56:12] <%InugamiTheHound> I guess in the future "blue lives don't matter"
[4:56:16] <ravencloak13> Well, it’s still in a capsule.
[4:56:30] <%dekkitout> That- that was a goat noise...
[4:56:35] <%Jeemukun> why are they bleatinf
[4:56:40] <%doc_ock_rokc> @InugamiTheHound They are no longer blue they REDSHIFTED
[4:56:41] <%Big_King_Coconut> why are you fighting JRPG enemies?
[4:56:45] <%StaceMcGate> photo

[4:57:39] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> If Olive dies, who will Brenda marry?
[4:57:43] <ravencloak13> @buzzard42 Finishing move.
[4:57:43] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Hey are you going to be upset because you can only get 99% completion of the red crystals because you missed those two behind a barrel in that alley like almost two hours ago?
[4:57:44] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat how'd you do that arm legion missile barrage?
[4:57:46] <%doc_ock_rokc> or Redshifted
[4:57:47] <ammobasket> I can't believe it
[4:57:47] <Sphincter_Spelunker> @King_Wolf_Rigger lappy

[4:57:56] <%ArcanumMBD> They have arms and legs and walk upright... just like us!!
[4:57:59] <GenericTwitchAcc1> that's just cock gargling sounds
[4:58:01] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @Sphincter_Spelunker Acceptable.
[4:58:12] <ShichiNoBushi> Or she would be redshifted and you would have to kill her.
[4:58:14] <ravencloak13> What legs? They had only bellies.
[4:58:15] <%doc_ock_rokc> Also we have ways to detect corruption why do we not know the level needed to redshift and have those detectors on common people/cops
[4:58:16] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @GenericTwitchAcc1 And you know how?
[4:58:18] <%Keyd00d> LUL

[4:59:12] <ravencloak13> @doc_ock_rokc Too much money, the general public can get fucked given the government corruption we know is a thing and given some stuff at the beginning this is going the EVA thing.

[5:00:37] <8_Bit_Badger> Pat get a picture of this big boy
[5:00:38] <%worldbrand> Chimera never killed a single person, just like Kiryu

[5:00:57] <%DeathsDoom> The game is very PG with death of "good people"
[5:00:57] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat Its the kiryu of chimaras
[5:01:01] <%Keyd00d> now it doesn't shoot

[5:01:15] <%InugamiTheHound> that gun looks too big for olive
[5:01:21] <ravencloak13> @sphincter_spelunker Do you know how many deities did that? By all accounts Adam and Eve were related cause God used one of his ribs as a catalyst.

[5:03:37] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Olive better just propose right there and then when you find Brenda.
[5:03:37] <BlacSoul> you are no police, why wear police armor?
[5:03:40] <%Soul_Intern> Oh Hal

[5:19:12] <%StaceMcGate> but it auto saves
[5:19:26] <RupanSen> I heard the next cutscene was directed by Kojima
[5:19:29] <Valdorick> But do you have that as a super mode now?
[5:19:30] <+Slowpoking> Komm Susser Todd (akria) Howard
[5:19:32] <transporterthesequel> I am also so glad she's not dead
[5:19:35] <ravencloak13> Not being subtle and getting mad people didn’t realize.
[5:19:35] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> I know people who use subtlety, they're cowards.
[5:19:36] <islandoasis> eva made stupid bible referneces cool in anime
[5:19:39] <gekizenbu> @Valdorick we now have permanent devil trigger
[5:19:39] <Valdorick> Do you put your cop gauge into your sin cop gauge?
[5:19:39] <KitsuneManami> @AngriestPat Aren't Late Game Devil Triggers great? coughDMC5
[5:19:39] <a_mad_dragon> even if she did, there were plenty of clones to replace her Kappa
[5:19:42] <Onmi_Khaos> I mean Pat... she did die. This is a clone of our original sister
[5:19:44] <al0nem0nster> she's probably a clone.
[5:19:52] <BlacSoul> NO WE DIDNT\
[5:19:54] <LandOfTheWay> bullshit, i never trusted him
[5:19:59] <ChaoticDaKiller> Getting stabbed through the chest is just a kink for Akira at this point it's fine
[5:20:00] <%shootbang_exe> my gut says clone
[5:20:01] <%SilvaChariot0133> *Whistles*
[5:20:01] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Aren't we all just clones, in one way or another?
[5:20:03] <%salty_syd913> salty_syd913 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months! yeyeye happy 9 months that was hype! also its my birthday, glad its starting on this!!! hope you're doing well *dab*
[5:20:05] <%shootbang_exe> original sister big dead
[5:20:06] <%mayorrev> where's Marie?
[5:20:06] <Onmi_Khaos> Oh my god
[5:20:07] <%InugamiTheHound> does it count a incest if you fucked a evil clone of your sister?
[5:20:09] <%Zombrocom> Never trusted him for even a single second
[5:20:11] <islandoasis> that guy doesnt fit ocaton's voice at all
[5:20:12] <Onmi_Khaos> did she just give the shinji line?
[5:20:14] <%SirFancySwank> she is kinda dumb,
[5:20:15] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Ben Riley Akira
[5:20:17] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat Hal is totally an A.I
[5:20:17] <%BestTeaMaker> she's not the clone
[5:20:18] <+HyperCharge_Sam> pretty sure she's the original cause she was commanding the others
[5:20:19] <Valdorick> … Hal's really Heuy, isn't he? He's working with Yosphes...
[5:20:20] <%Kiiper> pretty sure this is the real one
[5:20:29] <ravencloak13> @al0nem0nster Why give her a brain compared to the other clones though? She’s real.
[5:20:29] <al0nem0nster> Either that or she was the first clone.
[5:20:31] <%rdark_ksu> or just kill him, who cares what he has to say he has tried to murder you like 4 times now
[5:20:31] <%dekkitout> I'd love to see Akira and the clones get into shenanigans like the clone-sisters from Knights of Sidonia
[5:20:33] <%StaceMcGate> you were stabbed in the chest
[5:20:34] <%Stratiotai2> apatDab
[5:20:38] <GenericTwitchAcc1> LUL
[5:20:38] <%Nina96> k now shes gonna die
[5:20:40] <%ShaneWhite> Fusion Time!!!!
[5:20:43] <%Keyd00d> *nod*
[5:20:45] <+temporal_zenith> @StaceMcGate and the sides!
[5:20:55] <%SirFancySwank> the twist in the sequel will be hat she was a clone all along
[5:20:58] <%kyh9> Isn't it nice that she's on your side? She isn't some brainwashed Sasuke
[5:20:59] <%ArcanumMBD> @onmi_khaos no she didn't. there's no proof she did. you also have a mission after the stabs where you reminisce about your past, while the clones don't seem to have any memories or personality
[5:21:01] <%Keyd00d> where is Hal
[5:21:07] <ScreamLord> @StaceMcGate And we were shot a million times and fell 100 stories off a bridge.
[5:21:07] <+Clik404> @dekkitout The Akira collective says hi
[5:21:08] <ChaoticDaKiller> look at this big final mission warning
[5:21:10] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> I don't think she's a clone. I think she DT'd to a lesser extent and that's why she's still kicking.
[5:21:12] <%Keyd00d> This takes FOREVER TO CHARGE btw
[5:21:13] <%reonome> DT UNLOCKED
[5:21:14] <Onmi_Khaos> Then how is she alive Arc?
[5:21:15] <%ThatOneGameTester> is Hal just a Yorha person
[5:21:16] <Idon__> yeah just shove it straight into your heart
[5:21:16] <islandoasis> HENSHIN
[5:21:17] <%Starlight_Gamer> ripper mode
[5:21:22] <al0nem0nster> @ravencloak13 A trial period to insure teh cloning process worked, as well as it being easier to simply copy over an entire brain rather than create a slave memory from scratch. Add to this that suddenly when she came back she seemed to be really really into being Loyal to Evil McEvilMan and teh evidence piles up.
[5:21:22] <noobpsyboticus> noice
[5:21:23] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Kill yourself to get more power
[5:21:24] <Valdorick> The Twist in the sequel is that she's really a cat. Cats were the true Legion all along.
[5:21:28] <%Keyd00d> You won't get to use it a lot
[5:21:29] <islandoasis> become the guyver
[5:21:30] <%StaceMcGate> ooh side quests
[5:21:31] <%InugamiTheHound> rage of Sparta
[5:21:32] <Idon__> Alright pro-tip: This takes 7 years to charge so be careful
[5:21:32] <%spacehouse> pls let there be 5 different ones
[5:21:33] <%dekkitout> Soul Resonance
[5:21:34] <Onmi_Khaos> she got Hole'd
[5:21:39] <HawkGoggles2> I going to be honest, I don't like the DT in this game at all.
[5:21:40] <%Ion_Laser> To activate DEVIL TRIG-I mean LEGION FUSION
[5:21:40] <+OUTheTeam> what a good game
[5:21:44] <+Vayatan> you'll get MAYBE one use of it per mission
[5:21:49] <+HyperCharge_Sam> It takes FOREVER to charge it up
[5:21:49] <%republicofu> How is this going to span into a trilogy
[5:21:50] <+twohitgood> 42 hours so far
[5:21:51] <WanderingSwordsman> you can get an item that'll give 100% but not sure if you can buy it this chapter
[5:21:54] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> I wish there was a Guyver game. Bio-boosted armour was so cool.
[5:21:56] <+Clik404> @hawkgoggles2 More for the sequel to improve on
[5:21:59] <%ThatOneGameTester> Cat legion would jsut be the jaguar from DMC 5
[5:22:00] <%McSnazzyPants> @angriestpat when you have the chance, listen to the female version of dark hero
[5:22:08] <%Stratiotai2> bang bang bang pull my legion fusion
[5:22:12] <%StaceMcGate> dirty legions
[5:22:15] <Idon__> ????
[5:22:16] <%dekkitout> Is Crysis as close as we get to Guyver?
[5:22:21] <%Keyd00d> 10
[5:22:22] <%supersugoisenpai1> You also restore health while doing it
[5:22:28] <HawkGoggles2> @Clik404 I mean, sure if they don't throw away the main gimmick of the game again.
[5:22:29] <%NeroInfinite> even more xbox
[5:22:31] <islandoasis> dress up ur legions
[5:22:32] <%Divryne> Yuck Woolie colors.
[5:22:34] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Last colour set?
[5:22:34] <Sphincter_Spelunker> cmonBruh
[5:22:37] <%mayorrev> is Lappy dead
[5:22:40] <%42nfl19> @angriestpat technically story wise you should get a free DT when you die based on the Legion not wanting to die
[5:22:50] <%Soul_Intern> @mayorrev Retired. For now.
[5:22:50] <mudapersona> is hal just the Male version of that ai women In halo
[5:22:51] <%Keyd00d> Only one story file left
[5:22:56] <%StaceMcGate> that hat ruins your outfit
[5:22:57] <islandoasis> but the legion does want to die
[5:22:58] <8_Bit_Badger> make everything all pink to confuse the enemies
[5:22:59] <%mayorrev> :(
[5:23:01] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> ew
[5:23:03] <%Soul_Intern> YUCK
[5:23:03] <%Keyd00d> no it's fine

[5:23:07] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat Woolie's gonna shit when he finds out you can become a cool Monstar with dreadlocks
[5:23:07] <%Zombrocom> Ew
[5:23:07] <islandoasis> cause its so embarassed you did so bad
[5:23:07] <%NeroInfinite> oof the fuck is that piss color
[5:23:10] <%Ion_Laser> :D
[5:23:10] <%arcaderabbit48> Holy christ

[5:23:12] <%Stratiotai2> PUT IT ON
[5:23:12] <%Kiiper> It's High-Vis
[5:23:13] <eanscrale> For visbility
[5:23:13] <Buzzard42> wear Rescue (red)
[5:23:14] <SlimeSlimeSlime> It's like Woolie threw up Reboot all over you.
[5:23:14] <%InugamiTheHound> woolie would wear it
[5:23:14] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Crysis is close in appearance to Guyver, but you can't even chest beam in that lol.
[5:23:15] <%SirFancySwank> garbo color
[5:23:16] <a_mad_dragon> VIRULENT green
[5:23:16] <Onmi_Khaos> Do we have any new jackets/chest pieces
[5:23:19] <ravencloak13> @al0nem0nster Except you can literally say she just felt grateful to not only get her powers back but also be alive and be useful. Plus what we see soon... yeah them making “trial” versions makes no sense. Timeline doesn’t even add up either.
[5:23:20] <al0nem0nster> @42nfl19 Either that or canonically every time you died in the past the legion gained control and just killed everybody.
[5:23:20] <arkv01> become fashion DISASTA
[5:23:21] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat what are you talking about it's beautiful Kappa
[5:23:23] <GuilKato> pat is dressing up instead of maxing numbers!
[5:23:23] <DiamondZex> If this game is suppose to be a trilogy if it's done well.
[5:23:24] <%shootbang_exe> yep
[5:23:25] <%Keyd00d> good dog
[5:23:27] <islandoasis> only by being really hype will the legion want to fuse with you
[5:23:28] <+Slowpoking> It's the Bang Bang Shooting colors
[5:23:30] <%BioApple> that's just speed iirc
[5:23:40] <%arancet> yeah is speed
[5:23:41] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Big Streams
[5:23:43] <%mayorrev> did Pat find any more reference colors
[5:23:43] <Buzzard42> pathouse
[5:23:44] <%StaceMcGate> apatDab apatDab apatDab

[5:23:51] <GenericTwitchAcc1> I did it :)
[5:23:52] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Great stream man.
[5:23:54] <vVAstrAVv> goodnight pathouse
[5:23:55] <al0nem0nster> @ravencloak13 Oooooh you're basing your knowledge on actually having seen the rest of the game rather than theorizing, okay then.
[5:23:56] <%dekkitout> Ya did it
[5:23:56] <+Vayatan> woo, hype final boss next time
[5:23:56] <ScreamLord> Lickity Splick?

[5:24:15] <thisisacoolguy> Female Dark Hero time PogChamp?
[5:24:17] <%Monkeyweed21> what about ability codes @AngriestPat
[5:24:22] <%InugamiTheHound> very nice stream and I got pat to talk about wendy's(get them spicy nuggets)
[5:24:22] <DiamondZex> most likely on Nintendo's next console, there might be another game
[5:24:31] <ravencloak13> @al0nem0nster Yes though I made the same logical assumption before hand.
[5:24:35] <%StaceMcGate> Jena just had to say literally anything
[5:24:43] <al0nem0nster> @ravencloak13 sure ya did.
[5:24:44] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat Woolie's gonna cream his pants when he sees that you can become a cool Evangelion Monstar with Dreds
[5:24:48] <%42nfl19> does peach still feel up to as tream this sathurday? @angriestpat
[5:25:01] <SwindlerOfProgress> For real
[5:25:05] <%Monkeyweed21> Did you just turn into Woolie bait?
[5:25:07] <%Stratiotai2> pat house is made of redbull cans he threw on the ground
[5:25:12] <thisisacoolguy> Jena loves being a cliche let her live her life
[5:25:16] <%SirFancySwank> literally say anything
[5:25:21] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> It would have been so fast and easy to tell people what's happening. She was an idiot.
[5:25:24] <%supersugoisenpai1> They can never know
[5:25:29] <%Soul_Intern> LET THEM FIND OUT
[5:25:30] <SwindlerOfProgress> @thisisacoolguy This is also true
[5:25:32] <ravencloak13> Yes cause they would believe the dirty hobo woman.
[5:25:32] <%worldbrand> Step 1 to outing yourself: say yeyeyeyeyeye
[5:25:35] <islandoasis> but pat and woolie stole all their material from red letter media
[5:25:36] <Buzzard42> no
[5:25:38] <arkv01> wool you gotta confront them and bust their nuts
[5:25:38] <%Keyd00d> Play a good game instead
[5:25:39] <wizzerobe93> Yar
[5:25:43] <%Stratiotai2> yes
[5:25:43] <Buzzard42> don't play BL3
[5:25:44] <lionmanguy> Just pirate
[5:25:48] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat You ruined my speech patterns! You and the rest of the Zaibatsu!
[5:25:48] <WanderingSwordsman> pirate it if you must
[5:25:48] <al0nem0nster> It's a borderlands.
[5:25:49] <+mikesapartment> borderlands was never good
[5:25:49] <Buzzard42> just grind Astral Chain forever
[5:25:50] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Pirate the game, donate money to a charity.
[5:25:51] <%Soul_Intern> Just pirate it bruv
[5:25:52] <%Stratiotai2> heard real good
[5:25:53] <%d00msdaydan> god bless cw
[5:25:55] <%Kiiper> Game is super hitchy
[5:25:56] <thisisacoolguy> It runs genuinely terrible on PC
[5:25:57] <%Monkeyweed21> They MIGHT have given reviewers a better version
[5:25:58] <%MasterDecoder> I've been hearing more positives than negatives
[5:25:58] <%miguelrod777> its be on sale used after a week probably
[5:25:58] <ravencloak13> That also is just oozing Chimera juice.
[5:26:01] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> wait, what's happening?
[5:26:01] <%luftraumm1> put your time in blasphemous
[5:26:02] <%InugamiTheHound> take a shit on a copy of the game
[5:26:04] <%GeneralSCPatton> Let them find out to achieve a sync rate of over 100% and do Teacher-Student Fusion
[5:26:06] <%Kiiper> lots of FPs drops
[5:26:08] <Valdorick> EPIC GAMES WILL MAKE IT BETTER
[5:26:08] <GobblesInTheMist> Fuck Australia internet missed 4 hours of the stream last i saw Pat was at Jena
[5:26:16] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> we talkin about B3?
[5:26:17] <%42nfl19> 85 is still a B right?
[5:26:18] <Valdorick> /s
[5:26:19] <%luftraumm1> blasphemous is somewhat short
[5:26:19] <%Monkeyweed21> Reviewers MIGHT have a version with better RNG
[5:26:20] <thisisacoolguy> It requires a 2MB connection at all times do to DRM
[5:26:21] <%Soul_Intern> Use your time for Blasphemous, an ACTUAL good game
[5:26:22] <%doc_ock_rokc> Wha thappened
[5:26:25] <%NeroInfinite> what happen
[5:26:25] <%doc_ock_rokc> what game
[5:26:25] <ravencloak13> @zaphire_saucypants Yes.
[5:26:29] <%Keyd00d> mobile
[5:26:33] <ravencloak13> PC sucks anyway.
[5:26:33] <islandoasis> borderlands is bad?
[5:26:35] <%Ion_Laser> oof
[5:26:37] <%worldbrand> WHAT
[5:26:40] <al0nem0nster> that's like "I made this cake by sacrificing the souls of 1000 orphans." "how is it." "tsalright."
[5:26:43] <%RubberFistFight> of course it runs badly on PC, they're getting bankrolled by Big Daddy Epic, there's no longer any need for them to provide a marketable product.
[5:26:44] <DiamondZex> it's a mobile game tho
[5:26:49] <%worldbrand> I mean I should have expected that from konami but i'm still bummed as fuck to- oh it's mobile
[5:26:50] <%Zombrocom> As expected of Konami
[5:26:52] <thisisacoolguy> Like consider that, DRM requires a 2MB connection at all times. What the *fuck*
[5:26:58] <+Anonymasque> I've never even seen a Borderlands outside of character art.
[5:26:58] <ScreamLord> Pachinko must be dying out a bit
[5:27:02] <%Keyd00d> yeah the game is already paid for, why should they care
[5:27:03] <%luftraumm1> @angriestpat if you're looking for a game to play when you end AC get Blasphemous
[5:27:04] <%arcaderabbit48> @AngriestPat What if you buy the console version used from Gamestop? Does that keep Randy form getting money?
[5:27:12] <%worldbrand> Yeah there's new legislation incoming on pachinko, so
[5:27:20] <%FirearmsInstructor> @Keyd00d ;-;
[5:27:29] <%doc_ock_rokc> Borderlands is bad? You mean all the times i got massively downvoted for saying it looks like it might be bad were correct
[5:27:29] <%InugamiTheHound> @arcaderabbit48 buy a used copy so 2k and randy gets no money!!
[5:27:32] <%Monkeyweed21> They replaced the memes with poop jokes
[5:27:39] <ScreamLord> @arcaderabbit48 Yes but then Gamestop get your money.
[5:27:44] <islandoasis> sultry tones of sensual pat
[5:27:49] <Sphincter_Spelunker> @Anonymasque there's a 90 minute video going around on Youtube summerizing the lore. it's better than playing it
[5:27:50] <@lewdskeletor13> Yeah the paperback for that series is coming out in November/December @angriestpat
[5:27:52] <%arcaderabbit48> @ScreamLord Lesser of many evils
[5:27:55] <Valdorick> @arcaderabbit48 They already got money from the fact its used, and they already got money from Epic... so yeah, go for it.
[5:27:56] <%Soul_Intern> OHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
[5:27:56] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> OHHHHHHHH

[5:28:15] <%doc_ock_rokc> Oh damn it pat! I just CHANGED THESE PANTS
[5:28:16] <islandoasis> isnt it a game made for him?
[5:28:16] <%moogleboy1984> Blasphemous is like, perfectly balanced Metroidvania andDark Souls, but it has quite a few bugs
[5:28:17] <@lewdskeletor13> No way
[5:28:18] <%FirearmsInstructor> @GeneralSCPatton Soul Trolls... :|
[5:28:22] <%Keyd00d> D:

[5:28:28] <+Audega> And stick to it no weeks
[5:28:30] <islandoasis> whats control?
[5:28:30] <%worldbrand> you basically update it every day
[5:28:31] <Valdorick> BUT THEN YOU DON'T FOLLOW IT ANYWAY!

[5:28:34] <LandOfTheWay> @AngriestPat bold of you to assume we can read
[5:28:34] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Regardless, that was pretty slick.
[5:28:36] <al0nem0nster> It's bold of you to assume your fanbase can read.
[5:28:37] <%Monkeyweed21> But the schedule is worthless
[5:28:37] <%mayorrev> you don't follow it
[5:28:38] <Ominnous> Hey Pat are you planning on playing Greefall?
