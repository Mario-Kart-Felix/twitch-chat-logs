[0:09:11] <sonofthedeepsouth> One World Government headed by Google soon Tm

[0:10:23] <%ElenaManetta> I MEAN doesn't a person assume if you're playing a game, you will be spoiled watching it
[0:10:33] <+Pud_Beard> Cause the EXP scaling for levels is logarithmic.
[0:10:34] <%ElenaManetta> I don't know streamer etiquette
[0:10:35] <bestwaifuritsu> there are tons of level 80s already
[0:10:35] <PunishedRaccoon> @AngriestPat sorry if that sounded mean i just dont want people to bitch at you if they rando come in

[0:10:43] <Gnapalm> Pat, how come you will stream FF for 12 hours, but are afraid of going 5 hours on the pod? are you worried by the precedent it would set?
[0:10:44] <Nina96> absolutely someone did
[0:10:48] <%Dwarven_Gaming> people skipped cutscenes
[0:10:58] <%Mekhet09> Alliance was a dick and gave me the FFT Raid I hadn't done in months. It was not a fun time.
[0:11:02] <sonofthedeepsouth> Shit
[0:11:02] <QuasarKnightGaming> My buddy Chris said he stayed up all night and finished it
[0:11:20] <+Pud_Beard> So it sounds like 70 to 71 and then Roulettes
[0:11:21] <Nina96> @AngriestPat did u level up at all since last knight?
[0:11:36] <bestwaifuritsu> your goal today is Titania no death clear :^)

[0:48:08] <%Valdorick> "Hey should we use light bending magic on these people who worship light begins? I mean, they can't possibly see invisible people, yeah?"
[0:48:33] <Sol_Install> Oh he has big dick energy
[0:48:36] <masso101> @based_lobster well if pat and Paige feel the same way about how they treat fans, then I’m not sure how comfortable I am following them anymore.

[0:54:05] <BunnyEmperor> LULW I just forced Thancred to die in a trust dungeon
[0:54:05] <%THATGUY_789> all the best everyone
[0:54:10] <$SweetCheeksTrap> gross
[0:54:12] <CyborgAV> I like thinking that it's not bugged, but they're just saying it is 'cause they now realize how bad it is and want to change it
[0:54:15] <%Faustgesicht> FUCKING 2.2 is what
[0:54:19] <+StrawberryPantsu> There's like only one good face on Viera
[0:54:20] <sonofthedeepsouth> Big Ol Lore

[0:55:36] <jackythefrost> Infection
[0:55:36] <Zebroneath> Infections
[0:55:41] <%ProtagonistJake> lame
[0:55:54] <%Roundelay11> This is a good one

[0:56:02] <sonofthedeepsouth> Pat is on his second wind
[0:56:03] <%NWR_James> Pat now trying to best Paige in language assaults by erasing meaning of the word "tired"

[0:56:07] <suikudo> Whoa
[0:56:11] <+deaddonkey1> @angriestpat probably get asked this a lot but will you try classicwow when it launches?
[0:56:11] <Oleam458> from what I remember they switched terms because infections can be treat and possibly cured. or something
[0:56:14] <+YiggityYoni> who reads books with words in 2019
[0:56:26] <suikudo> I just realized that when you get a girl preggos you are basically infecting her with child
[0:56:37] <suikudo> Humans are gross
[0:56:40] <%Valdorick> Ah man, its the Bookaphile

[1:07:26] <laserbeaming> You want to see his Bishie Face? KappaPride
[1:07:29] <+funnyfunnykid> hello eggman, I wish to play the game but I'm afraid till give me the bad vibes that WoW did for me.
[1:07:32] <alrobot2014> what if the top of his face is just more stone LUL
[1:07:41] <ScreamingMeat> Deeeerrrp
[1:07:57] <MeatClackin> This is a Sueenix game, the hood stays on.
[1:08:05] <MSN04_Sazabi> Let's raze Eulmore to the ground LUL
[1:08:08] <laserbeaming> What if he's a floating black void from the nose up?
[1:08:14] <%NWR_James> crymtyme?
[1:08:17] <weewii> he got permanent groucho face, and doesn't want people to laugh at him
[1:08:20] <alrobot2014> is it the red cape
[1:08:24] <suikudo> Yea that is very similar to the agito cadet uniform
[1:08:37] <ScreamingMeat> The fuck was that dude?
[1:08:37] <Jolnir> that fucking accent
[1:08:45] <%mor_materia_company> Reminds me of the Drangleic armor from DS2
[1:08:52] <Jolnir> skyrim
[1:08:54] <%Typhaeon> It sounds Dutch
[1:08:55] <%VioletHeart> Icelandic.
[1:08:56] <%Dwarven_Gaming> icelandic?
[1:08:56] <suikudo> Its just how Viera talk
[1:08:58] <%Valdorick> Fantasy
[1:08:58] <deathsmions1> "french"
[1:08:59] <%mor_materia_company> Also I just spend 3 hours in traffic for a 20 minute drive. But I'm finally here!
[1:08:59] <%ThatOneGameTester> the Viera accent Kappa
[1:09:00] <RavenHellkite> spanish
[1:09:01] <MSN04_Sazabi> Fake European
[1:09:06] <+Solutha> Skyrim belongs to the Viera
[1:09:08] <suikudo> Fran talked like that in 12 remember?
[1:09:10] <%NWR_James> Chat agrees: It's all of the accents
[1:09:11] <ScreamingMeat> Weird Fantasy Danish
[1:09:11] <jackythefrost> Its the fake french accent they had in FFXII
[1:09:15] <+meatgeneral69> bork bork norm
[1:09:24] <%VioletHeart> Or it might not be quite Icelandic but Northern European. A bit harder to place since you don't hear it as often.
[1:09:27] <laserbeaming> I mean, the Viera can take Skyrim, I'm ok with that
[1:09:36] <%Dwarven_Gaming> its icelandic
[1:09:39] <%rdark_ksu> bunny
[1:09:40] <%ThatOneGameTester> i'm sure there's a mod for that
[1:09:49] <alrobot2014> skyrim would be best off in the hands of the viera
[1:09:49] <ClumzyDragon> what is that pose?
[1:09:55] <thetruenicster> almost Yevon Shit
[1:10:04] <GarbageQueenEllie> Just be glad the salute isn't effing Blitzball
[1:10:13] <%mor_materia_company> It's very weird... its a meek little baby salute.
[1:10:14] <+Dogbert24> no special treatment = license to filler quest your ass
[1:10:16] <ScreamingMeat> The Viera are what happens when Playboy Bunny becomes a fantasy race
[1:10:21] <weewii> Bleetzbol
[1:10:28] <+Sgt_Wigglytuff> Blitzball > Yevon
[1:10:45] <laserbeaming> I hope the uniforms look like they were designed by Hugo Boss in the 40's
[1:10:54] <alrobot2014> isn't yevon basically a popped blitzball
[1:11:03] <midnightmile> ahh bleetzball
[1:11:06] <laserbeaming> Kappa
[1:11:14] <+meatgeneral69> lore fact: the viera ears ooze earwax
[1:11:17] <FishSkeleton> Hey Pat, I just finished the VoD of your Bloodstained stream. I was wondering, will you be returning to that game on stream at some point after some Shadowbringers binging, or did you decide to make that an off-stream game like you said you might? It's soothing and cathartic so I wouldn't blame you, but yeah, just wondering.
[1:11:26] <weewii> it all comes full circle, kinda like a ball
[1:11:56] <corrosivePaladin> What soured bloodstained for you?
[1:11:56] <GarbageQueenEllie> It's time for a big fahsion
[1:12:02] <$Yakobro> HUGE bulge
[1:12:04] <FishSkeleton> Ah, darn, it was a fun stream. All good though, thanks for the one we got.
[1:12:14] <+TheImmortal70> Yevon, the Brudda, and the holy Bleetzbol
[1:12:24] <powerline98> No one can resist the huge Pat bulge
[1:12:25] <RoidRidley> any plans for judge eyes? sorry if i missed smth i dont have twitter
[1:12:28] <+buffn99> Hello Pat and chat
[1:12:43] <%sshen> Pat, how do you feel about the new classes having weapon glams slapped into diadem
[1:12:43] <ClumzyDragon> the bunny girl with the ring blade \o/
[1:12:52] <weewii> hello buffn, how u doin'?
[1:12:54] <midnightmile> Lyna has a nice voice
[1:13:00] <alrobot2014> judgment and bloodstained are on pat time, shadowbringers and ff7 for use @RoidRidley
[1:13:05] <Jolnir> make a complex and detailed master plan with your compatriates that you take no part in gameplay-wise
[1:13:06] <alrobot2014> us*
[1:13:09] <%Bigbossman91> @angriestpat which lvl are your DRK at now?
[1:13:20] <%Lapinelis> I mean, you are the hero
[1:13:29] <ScreamingMeat> They don't even do the Yevon bow correctly
[1:13:48] <+buffn99> @weewii Good man B), you?
[1:13:54] <GarbageQueenEllie> dude that splat sound
[1:13:58] <powerline98> This is my first time watching Pat's stream and also I have no idea what this game is, was the guy he last talked to Beerus?
[1:14:09] <%GarbageNirvana> Do they still do the exp boost thing where you get a bonus up to the max level you have on your main job?
[1:14:27] <ScreamingMeat> It's called Coffee Pat
[1:14:30] <Jolnir> like cum
[1:14:35] <soullesskin> I really want to get into this game but damn it’s sooo overwhelming when starting -.-
[1:14:35] <%NobleJedi> is it sugar free?
[1:14:37] <laserbeaming> *doctor hands over a red bull*
[1:14:44] <+StrawberryPantsu> Horse cum
[1:14:57] <TheCrook92> it was horse piss
[1:15:00] <%Valdorick> "I'd say you even enjoyed it... now lick your lips."
[1:15:02] <powerline98> there we go
[1:15:05] <%GarbageNirvana> @soullesskin The nice thing about FFXIV is that a big part of its community is super helpful and willing to help you get started
[1:15:07] <%solomonpun> Isn't princes kiss the item in ff games that heals toad?
[1:15:08] <%salty_syd913> are you sure?
[1:15:08] <laserbeaming> Does it taste like apples? @StrawberryPantsu
[1:15:10] <GarbageQueenEllie> It was probably Monster
[1:15:11] <%bunnyyumi> no it was sugar free redbull
[1:15:14] <SummonerMagno> it was chocobos
[1:15:15] <Jolnir> very erotic potion
[1:15:15] <$haitchkay> I've never played FF14 and have never watched Pat stream it before. What the hell is going on
[1:15:18] <%doc_ock_rokc> Pat knows from experence
[1:15:20] <%Valdorick> He's right - I mean, are there even any horses here?
[1:15:23] <ErraticPillow> rabbit milk
[1:15:24] <ScreamingMeat> I mean, it could have Horse Cum in it. You never know with Alchemy
[1:15:29] <%Gogogolem> Probably Bull cum.
[1:15:39] <%doc_ock_rokc> Chocobo cum?
[1:15:39] <+StrawberryPantsu> *Chocobo cum
[1:15:45] <ClumzyDragon> horse race when?
[1:15:45] <Jolnir> unicorn splooge probably has health benefits
[1:15:50] <%theturtlebar> You literally have 6 horses in your mount log
[1:15:51] <doodledumps> No no, if it's alchemy it's gotta be squirrel semen
[1:15:52] <+StrawberryPantsu> Whatever they're called on the 1st
[1:15:52] <FishSkeleton> It always feels so weird when I watch a more modern MMO like this, or anything that feels like Archage or Rift or Black Desert. I'm just used to them being more cartoony, but my experience is based in old Runescape forever ago and then tons of WoW, so eh.
[1:15:56] <alrobot2014> could be like cat's circles in DmC and have squirrel cum
[1:15:58] <$haitchkay> and why is everyone talking about horse cum
[1:16:08] <laserbeaming> bird
[1:16:14] <ErraticPillow> GIV BURD
[1:16:16] <haveswordmuststing> @haitchkay he drank a weird thing for a quest
[1:16:19] <%GarbageNirvana> Pat's horse porn site leaked again
[1:16:19] <+Sgt_Wigglytuff> Picked the worst viera ears though
[1:16:24] <RavenHellkite> it's chat they always talk about every type of cum
[1:16:37] <+StrawberryPantsu> Lore Book Smells like Play-Dough...
[1:16:41] <powerline98> oh I GOTTA click that link
[1:16:46] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat do the aether currents when they give ou a thing
[1:16:51] <%Fenrirlives> Hey Pat! perfect timing!
[1:16:54] <soullesskin> @garbagenirvana really? Huh didn’t know that, where could I go to get help?
[1:17:00] <Jolnir> the entire shadowbringers expansion is an acid trip youre currently fitting in the middle of the rising sands
[1:17:02] <ClumzyDragon> bird chan \o/
[1:17:04] <parkslady> good birb
[1:17:07] <$Yakobro> BIRD SQUAD
[1:17:08] <%doc_ock_rokc> i like that the light has bleached the plants resulting in a purple landscape
[1:17:11] <%salty_syd913> yoooo nice bird!
[1:17:11] <+Solutha> thicc
[1:17:12] <laserbeaming> Oh, 4 wins
[1:17:14] <TheCrook92> did you ever get all of the birb's Pat? cirThink
[1:17:15] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat you can do the aether currents with that bird
[1:17:18] <laserbeaming> wings*
[1:17:20] <%Fenrirlives> are these anti Chocobo?
[1:17:22] <%GarbageNirvana> @soullesskin The ffxiv reddit's a good place to start, there's also videos online you could look up. Larryzaur's got some good starter vids
[1:17:38] <hypecactuar> Whens WarFrame Pat
[1:17:49] <%luftraumm1> enough to get all aether currents
[1:17:59] <%GarbageNirvana> And y'know if you sub you could always hop into the discord cause we got a ff14 channel
[1:18:34] <Laycas49> I was thinking about resubbing but I dunno how much more stormblood I have and if I have the willpower to do it
[1:18:36] <FishSkeleton> Reminds me of Crystalsong Forest from WoW.
[1:18:40] <Foggysheep> bird get
[1:18:48] <%Bigbossman91> @garbagenirvana Larryzaur is amazing
[1:18:55] <%salty_syd913> wow yeah thats super pretty
[1:19:00] <ScreamingMeat> I don't like that guy's dumb head crest
[1:19:05] <%madhattergay> hey @AngriestPat are you planning to watch the chrono cross speedrun later today?
[1:19:09] <%luftraumm1> after you restored nighttime does it change on the regular world map?
[1:19:12] <%GarbageNirvana> Yeah, I actually just discovered him recently, wonder why I never found his stuff before
[1:19:24] <%Fenrirlives> if I hop on today, will SMN changes have taken place already? I'm not on early access
[1:19:32] <%GarbageNirvana> @Fenrirlives afaik yes
[1:19:47] <laserbeaming> Pat will die in that couch, live on stream
[1:19:54] <MSN04_Sazabi> They'll show Chrono Cross speedruns to Pat once he goes to hell anyway
[1:19:57] <%Fenrirlives> fair nuff
[1:20:00] <%Mekhet09> CRAZY TALK
[1:20:00] <%Townspoon> What level of "NO LIFE" is pat currently at right now
[1:20:07] <%Mekhet09> You can still play current content.
[1:20:08] <TheCrook92> bury him in his cube cirBless
[1:20:11] <%Ninestempest> the battle changes are active but you can't be in SHB
[1:20:13] <hypecactuar> @laserbeaming clip it
[1:20:15] <%luftraumm1> how tf do you get on early access?
[1:20:17] <%Ninestempest> you could do sb stuff
[1:20:18] <Jolnir> hes making money no lifing. he is your god.
[1:20:20] <%SilvaChariot0133> Just won't get any of the 70+ stuff
[1:20:21] <ErraticPillow> im going to die relearning whtmage
[1:20:24] <%Valdorick> Come on guys, that's not how it works - he'll die when standing up, that's when the bloodclots happen.
[1:20:29] <storrin> Is the trial for this game a good representation of not worth it?
[1:20:36] <ErraticPillow> its good
[1:20:42] <ScreamingMeat> I thought it was gonna be a Chrono Trigger speedrun, not Cross?
[1:20:44] <%Gogogolem> for jobber
[1:20:47] <TheCrook92> thighs cirGasm
[1:20:48] <%tyler274> trial is not a good representation
[1:20:50] <powerline98> I thought he was gonna die from the sun
[1:20:51] <%sshen> Just grind eureka pat
[1:20:55] <%GarbageNirvana> The trial lets you play everything up to level 35, so you can at least get a feel for what the game's like in terms of the basics
[1:20:57] <ClumzyDragon> FeelsAmazingMan
[1:20:58] <%Fenrirlives> ooooh its glowy!
[1:20:58] <%tyler274> it ends in the middle of the worst part
[1:20:59] <%NWR_James> that's hot shit
[1:21:00] <%GarbageNirvana> But yeah the really good stuff doesn't start until after
[1:21:00] <laserbeaming> She's following you to show off Kappa
[1:21:10] <Razgrizenl> pat is one big boio jeez
[1:21:11] <ErraticPillow> uhh you can play till longer then 35 dud

[1:21:18] <+StrawberryPantsu> That looks dope
[1:21:19] <%madhattergay> @ScreamingMeat no tits a 6 hour run staring in about 4 hours

[1:21:22] <Mexrage> who need pants anyway
[1:21:22] <Jolnir> it will equip it for you when you start
[1:21:22] <ScreamingMeat> Pants are for loosers
[1:21:26] <%Valdorick> Pants Free Army
[1:21:29] <%GarbageNirvana> In the free trial? Did they extend it?
[1:21:30] <BakerBrute> eat pant
[1:21:30] <FishSkeleton> Hey Pat, dumb question about Shadowbringers that you've probably answered dozens of times: You've mentioned something before about how this game changed how classes work, or something, and that you just auto-advance to Job upgrades now when you're a new player? Did I misunderstand that? If not, does that throw new players to the wolves and leave them underprepared because they didn't do a slow and shitty 'class' before unlocking 'job tools'?
[1:21:33] <MarcusTheBitMiner> Is there a problem with you running into battle without pants?
[1:21:38] <+StrawberryPantsu> Cars
[1:21:46] <powerline98> pants slow you down
[1:21:46] <ErraticPillow> CAR
[1:21:50] <%salty_syd913> wait cars?
[1:21:50] <ClumzyDragon> really :O
[1:21:51] <%salty_syd913> what

[1:21:53] <ErraticPillow> THEY DID?
[1:21:55] <powerline98> WHAT
[1:21:59] <%Valdorick> No more dumb jerky drifting?
[1:22:00] <+PenmanLupine> still looks dumb
[1:22:03] <FishSkeleton> This game has cars? Uh
[1:22:05] <ClumzyDragon> wow :o
[1:22:08] <powerline98> Its just moving on a y axis
[1:22:08] <ErraticPillow> OH YE

[1:28:55] <$haitchkay> @AngriestPat as someone who has never played a single FF game and isn't generally a fan of JRPG's in general, am I totally justified in telling my friends to piss off when they give me shit for not being hype about the FF7 Remake?

[1:29:28] <+boybyfresh> @AngriestPat for someone that wants to play as a lion from the beginning would is there a way to play this under $100
[1:29:34] <GarbageQueenEllie> @haitchkay Considering the fact that it'll probably come out shortly after Guts leaves the boat- yes, yes you are.
[1:29:35] <laserbeaming> Does it have a horn?
[1:29:41] <Onillius> @AngriestPat what is level cap in FF14
[1:30:00] <%GarbageNirvana> That's not from the beginning tho
[1:30:05] <%biomegabear> Pat any plans to do the last dlc for ff15 on stream?
[1:30:08] <+Angrec> im a little dissapointed though, i wanted to be more of a warrior of dark and be villain. But while the story is hella good its the same shit
[1:30:20] <+Double_Tap_That> @AngriestPat What is the easiest multi-person mount to get that isn't a mog station item?
[1:30:23] <$haitchkay> I'm somehow one of the only people in three different friend groups who has never played FF7 and my reaction to the new footage was just "oh that's neat" and apparently that's just not okay
[1:30:41] <%GarbageNirvana> Yeah if you want personal story choice this isn't the game to play really

[1:31:06] <GarbageQueenEllie> @haitchkay I've played through, like, 40% of the original, and it's pretty good. But it aged pretty poorly, imo

[1:31:21] <%GarbageNirvana> A lot of 2.x stuff is pretty rough
[1:31:25] <%Lapinelis> @haitchkay You're basically doing the equivalent of going to someone and saying dbz was just ok. A lot of people have real deep investment into the series

[1:33:03] <$haitchkay> @Lapinelis It's crazy. I told someone in one discord I'm in that I don't even think I'll personally play the remake, just watch a stream of it, and was met with "Are you fucking serious?"
[1:33:12] <%Ninestempest> cause they're great emotes :(
[1:33:14] <%GarbageNirvana> People just want more emotes for less money
[1:33:15] <+Promessa_EX> that mount is so slow
[1:33:17] <deviljhojho94> Just do it 4Head
[1:33:19] <TheCrook92> why not have more great emotes?
[1:33:25] <%king_wragles> PAT, do you have a CHONKabo?
[1:33:28] <%FrustratedAF> i think you can automute words as a streamer
[1:33:34] <+ahmz1404> Is this Elden Ring
[1:33:35] <%FrustratedAF> and/or mod?
[1:33:38] <laserbeaming> People like gif emotes. But do as you please. It's not like it is a requirement

[1:34:31] <deviljhojho94> Pog

[1:35:05] <deviljhojho94> The pog is in our hearts tomatoHappy
[1:35:45] <+Pyr0_Fr0st> Oh ffs people are selling dungeons runs on Ultros for 350k to 5 million gil
[1:36:00] <Kazic5000> Pat I love your subscribe notification.
[1:36:07] <deviljhojho94> what a bunch of dorks
[1:36:14] <%GarbageNirvana> ngl I thought about getting in on that hustle
[1:36:25] <MoonObscure> lol
[1:36:26] <$Yakobro> LUL
[1:36:27] <laserbeaming> It seems no matter what MMO you go to, there's always someone selling runs
[1:36:27] <ricotez> just to reserve a dungeon instance no takes 10 minutes, it's useless to buy one
[1:36:30] <%ZizerX> haha
[1:36:32] <deviljhojho94> its like paying people for running a d n d campaign with you
[1:36:42] <+Nymphonomicon> Big and Strong cheating.
[1:36:56] <%madhattergay> PUPPER
[1:36:58] <%Fenrirlives> didn't they say they were adding height indicators on quest markers this exp?
[1:37:05] <%GarbageNirvana> I wonder if the Round had any knights of note
[1:37:09] <+Zxtole> That's ironic because a lot of people used to pay good DMs to play with them
[1:37:10] <%NWR_James> "It was originally The Square, but we thought that was stupid"
[1:37:12] <laserbeaming> I'll be you DM for $20 Kappa
[1:37:23] <jackythefrost> @Fenrirlives Yea they did, its great
[1:37:23] <deviljhojho94> what a steal
[1:37:43] <deviljhojho94> I have seen people DM for 50 bucks tomatoThief claimed they were veterans and shit but I aint payin 50 bucks for that
[1:38:08] <Kazic5000> Seeing a magic car in a game where people use swords and shields just floors me.
[1:38:22] <%GarbageNirvana> So hey, you ever think about how primals are basically just big-ass Personas
[1:38:25] <+Nymphonomicon> A car? Why is there FFXV in my FFXIV?
[1:38:41] <$haitchkay> wait what the fuck why is @AngriestPat driving a car
[1:38:45] <Stari> The car is from the FFXV cross over
[1:38:47] <%Valdorick> Because there was also a FFXIV in FFXV
[1:38:48] <Kazic5000> Look at it go
[1:38:53] <laserbeaming> It seems the sub gift badge now changes according to the amount of subs you've given
[1:38:54] <deviljhojho94> it goes at like 10km per hour too by the looks of it
[1:38:57] <%NWR_James> what if everyone had cars
[1:39:06] <+Nymphonomicon> Do all the spins in your sweet ride!
[1:39:14] <%Lapinelis> That car is a silier mount than the fat bo
[1:39:15] <%madhattergay> fukken i cant get 3 people together to play a campaign ive been working on for 2 years to save my life
[1:39:21] <+Nymphonomicon> But is it an S car that goes?
[1:39:32] <%Valdorick> Are you... going to... take us for a ride?
[1:39:34] <deviljhojho94> just bribe your friends
[1:39:37] <Kazic5000> Cool battlle music
[1:39:43] <TheCrook92> but Pat doesn't have a drivers licence? cirThink
[1:39:49] <FirewallStorm> seeing that car in this fantasy setting is the most jarring thing
[1:39:54] <+Pyr0_Fr0st> Oh wait it's a DPS that's selling a 5 mil dungeon run
[1:40:05] <TheCrook92> somebody pull him over cirCop
[1:40:06] <%GarbageNirvana> muther
[1:40:09] <deviljhojho94> Ah, but its not any fantasy setting! Its a FINAL fantasy tomatoCool
[1:40:31] <%Valdorick> The Final was Science Fiction all along.
[1:40:40] <BunnyEmperor> D:
[1:40:45] <Kazic5000> Sleepy cause of this riveting delivery quest
[1:40:48] <deviljhojho94> D:
[1:40:50] <$valriot> Cos you're playing Dark Knight omegalul
[1:40:50] <GarbageQueenEllie> Give us your oil
[1:40:51] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> @AngriestPat : "You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna go get me a '64 cadillac converible, Hot Pink, with Whaleskin Hubcaps and big brown baby seal eyes for headlights, yeah!"
[1:40:54] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat you may need sodium, potassium, protein or a combination of all 3
[1:40:59] <FirewallStorm> give us your brain
[1:41:01] <%Valdorick> Are you implying chat makes you dumb by proxy!? D: mean
[1:41:02] <%GarbageNirvana> It's been particularly rough for me because I'm supposed to be studying right now
[1:41:07] <ClumzyDragon> D: big true
[1:41:42] <%madhattergay> fetch quest times?
[1:41:44] <Jakeofalco> what are those arrows besides the quests ?
[1:42:06] <%GarbageNirvana> Like I'm probably gonna end up crunching as much ShB as I can over the weekend and then crunching schoolwork during the week
[1:42:08] <jackythefrost> @Jakeofalco It means its a level synced quest
[1:42:32] <Jakeofalco> @jackythefrost so you get level specific ep ?
[1:42:40] <Jakeofalco> xp
[1:42:47] <%madhattergay> how amny of the expansions do i have to buy to play shadowbringers eventually?
[1:42:49] <$valriot> The quests worth doing
[1:42:51] <BunnyEmperor> Blue Quests good Quests
[1:42:53] <%GarbageNirvana> Yeah all the sidequests are synced now I think
[1:43:05] <GarbageQueenEllie> Still waiting for those sexy Shadow Team uniforms
[1:43:10] <Jakeofalco> cool cheers
[1:43:16] <jackythefrost> They dont give different XP they just have different leveled mobs
[1:43:19] <Zebroneath> It means a quest that unlcoks a new gameplay thing, whether for a class or just in general.
[1:43:34] <%GarbageNirvana> Anyone else think it's wild that job quests are basically locked off until after the MSQ now?
[1:43:38] <Giothegame> FF14 is a game I wish I had fun playing. The story and everything looks amazing
[1:43:42] <$Yakobro> only ShB
[1:43:50] <+Fynale> only shadowbringers
[1:43:52] <%madhattergay> oh okay
[1:43:55] <%NWR_James> That's how it was last expansion
[1:43:55] <haveswordmuststing> shadowbringers comes with previous expansions
[1:43:55] <jackythefrost> You buy the latest one you get all of them, yes you have to have the base game already
[1:43:56] <+Fynale> it'll come with heavensward and stormblood
[1:43:58] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> I think shadowbringers is bundled with the other expansions
[1:44:00] <%Zepik> base game and ShB, buying newest xpac grants access to all
[1:44:01] <haveswordmuststing> not the base game
[1:44:01] <%ovan20> you only need to buy the last expansion and the base game
[1:44:03] <+Fynale> that's how stormblood worked
[1:44:09] <%GarbageNirvana> Time for FLYING CAR
[1:44:22] <56Bagels> PogChamp
[1:44:23] <$valriot> @angriestpat Go to the bottom left of Lakeland for weird shit
[1:44:31] <%Valdorick> Flying!? This early in the expansion!? What would Blizzard think!?
[1:44:41] <GarbageQueenEllie> Oh, you, chittychitty bangbang ,chittychitty bangbang, we love you
[1:44:51] <laserbeaming> This game hates my region. When I did the free trial I had so much lag the cone AoEs hit me even when I was behind the monsters
[1:45:05] <%GarbageNirvana> The way they do aether currents is actually kinda clever because it basically makes you explore the region before you get to fly over it
[1:45:08] <+vizzay> So any other Healer mains in here mourning the loss of Cleric Stance?
[1:45:36] <%Zepik> no
[1:45:44] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> wasnt cleric stance was like 5% damage for 10 seconds
[1:45:48] <+Dogbert24> dony miss it
[1:45:49] <KatabolicRage> in a way, I kindof miss lakelands eternal llight weather, is contributed to the otherwordly look
[1:45:50] <%sshen> I'm mourning protect and stoneskin
[1:45:51] <$haitchkay> I gotta go try to have less of a migraine and then maybe grind for an hour or two in Bloodstained. @AngriestPat enjoy your weirdo anime MMO game with cars and dragons and shit. Win all the quests and get all the anime points
[1:46:06] <+vizzay> That 5% was the best okay
[1:46:08] <%madhattergay> isnt amaro a gundam character?
[1:46:17] <%GarbageNirvana> I'm finding I don't miss Protect at all
[1:46:29] <+lucaflow> @AngriestPat You liking the tank changes? I've been leveling Gunbreaker and I feel a lot less anxious tanking now than I did before
[1:46:33] <%GarbageNirvana> But then all the AoE DPS makes it so you're not taking damage for long anyway
[1:46:41] <%Valdorick> The Chonkabo can FLY!?
[1:46:45] <%VantomPayne> ah, just like me eating tv dinner then
[1:47:12] <%GarbageNirvana> Nice
[1:47:21] <%GarbageNirvana> Should make tank switching a lot easier
[1:47:52] <+lucaflow> Yeah I like how provoke just dumps a ton of aggro on you
[1:47:57] <jackythefrost> So you even need Shierk anymore?
[1:47:59] <$valriot> Literal bottom left of the map @angriestpat
[1:47:59] <FingerMuffin> is thids game cross play?
[1:48:08] <%Mekhet09> Shierk is for tank shifting.
[1:48:09] <%madhattergay> pupper
[1:48:15] <$valriot> It's shaped like a whale
[1:48:16] <%Mekhet09> So yeah it's still necessary.
[1:48:20] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> that totally looks like its gonna get up
[1:48:23] <GarbageQueenEllie> This whole realm feels like a lullaby
[1:48:25] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> but what is it
[1:48:30] <deviljhojho94> very cool, gamers
[1:48:32] <midnightmile> AVATAR
[1:48:33] <deviljhojho94> crikCool
[1:48:38] <laserbeaming> Is Ken Masters hanging out in that island?

[1:49:16] <%Dwarven_Gaming> thats an eye
[1:49:20] <laserbeaming> Lick it obliLick
[1:49:22] <+lucaflow> theres an eye right there
[1:49:22] <+StrawberryPantsu> Sin Raid when?
[1:49:45] <%Zepik> truly we were the shadow bringers after all
[1:49:56] <laserbeaming> Crystal Coral, an essential part of the ecosystem
[1:50:24] <%GarbageNirvana> Back to spoilers = back to studying
[1:50:24] <laserbeaming> Not like the subaquatic ecosystem looks very alive in this doomed land
[1:50:26] <FingerMuffin> do ff14 exps ever go on sale
[1:50:57] <Retinolgaming> Correct
[1:50:59] <Retinolgaming> I just did that
[1:51:01] <GarbageQueenEllie> That's cool
[1:51:03] <%Ninestempest> That is how it works
[1:51:04] <Welcome_To_YoAssThiccPark> PogChamp
[1:51:04] <StripesUltimateEdition> holy shit
[1:51:08] <%NobleJedi> apatDab
[1:51:10] <+Zxtole> You can get it $5 off using the stream sale event
[1:51:16] <%salty_syd913> oh my god thats so dumb i love it
[1:51:17] <%GarbageNirvana> Another reason why this game's better than WoW :U
[1:51:17] <haveswordmuststing> stormblood was half off, but no point since shadowbringers comes with it
[1:51:23] <+Zxtole> Steam*
[1:51:30] <Quizzeh_> wow also does that GarbageNirvana
[1:51:33] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@wummzy) (warning)
[1:51:36] <%GarbageNirvana> Well they didn't used to
[1:51:41] <%madhattergay> god i wish flying the regalia in FFXV was that easy
[1:51:42] <%Kirijuo> I bought Shb for half off on amazon a few months ago
[1:51:42] <GarbageQueenEllie> Come on fashion fashion
[1:51:47] <Retinolgaming> @AngriestPat BUT they make you wait to get heavensward and stormblood until the official release date, so you have the base game until then.
[1:51:47] <StripesUltimateEdition> purple armor...
[1:51:56] <jackythefrost> Thats a short skirt
[1:51:57] <%Valdorick> Look, they have camouflaged armor!
[1:52:07] <+lucaflow> I never understood why the characters walk so slow during cutscenes
[1:52:07] <laserbeaming> Doesn't WoW upgrade all their base game owners to the previous expansion when a new one releases?
[1:52:19] <+Fynale> INC butt rock of the highest calibur
[1:52:26] <Jolnir> listen to this re1 basement theme out of nowhere

[1:54:13] <%doc_ock_rokc> I think Sleeping gas is more chemical warfare then biological
[1:54:16] <deviljhojho94> SEDUCE YOUR DRAGON
[1:54:17] <laserbeaming> It'd be fun if it showed your currently equipped mount. Like the car
[1:54:23] <%Lapinelis> I'm at 75 now and I've yet to get to a part that I actively disliked. What a great expansion.
[1:54:24] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@StrawberryPantsu) (warning)
[1:54:28] <ClumzyDragon> wait did you just fly under the sleeping powder?
[1:54:29] <Welcome_To_YoAssThiccPark> thought it was gonna turn into Lair Kappa

[1:59:15] <count_bob> At this point, I'd pretend to be asleep.
[1:59:16] <jackythefrost> Doing 8 blood spliters in a row is the best thing
[1:59:34] <$Yakobro> more skillspeed!
[1:59:36] <+TheImmortal70> Probably skillspeed
[1:59:43] <jackythefrost> Skill Speed
[1:59:45] <+Zxtole> Kill the sleeping soldiers D:
[1:59:46] <+TheImmortal70> So yeah, you'll want to build enough skill speed to do 8
[1:59:49] <+StrawberryPantsu> Git Gud?
[1:59:49] <ClumzyDragon> waifu saved
[1:59:49] <+Fynale> ok i got the nu mou i love them, they're dog people
[1:59:49] <+lucaflow> Whoa
[1:59:52] <%demegodz> She is tiny
[1:59:55] <%doc_ock_rokc> Don't worry pat. they are stabbing them repetitively
[1:59:57] <%rdark_ksu> she is wee
[1:59:58] <SummonerMagno> so tiny
[2:00:06] <ScreamingMeat> She looks like Weiss from RWBY
[2:00:06] <GarbageQueenEllie> Dude she looks smaller than the freaking elves
[2:00:12] <Lotharman> She got those Mako Eyes
[2:00:12] <%doc_ock_rokc> Mini Minifilia
[2:00:15] <BunnyEmperor> Like a Japanese dream
[2:00:16] <upsidedown01> Can XIV be played single-player, story mode, on PS4, no PSN subscription?
[2:00:16] <deviljhojho94> I wonder if XIV will eventually overtake WoW as the MMORPG king. Last I heard the sub counts where still not even close
[2:00:18] <ClumzyDragon> big cute big tiny
[2:00:20] <Sol_Install> to bad she born to die
[2:00:21] <gekizenbu> how far can we toss minifilia
[2:00:22] <$SGrim> The pupil=less eyes are kinda freaky
[2:00:23] <upsidedown01> 'cause this looks fucking awesome
[2:00:27] <ExpressNode> She's tiny
[2:00:27] <bestwaifuritsu> pedofilia LUL
[2:00:32] <laserbeaming> "How come your mom let's you have 8 Blood Spliters?"
[2:00:33] <%Evil_John_Cena> Hi Pat
[2:00:33] <$Yakobro> stab me mommy
[2:00:36] <$OmegaWeltall> LUL
[2:00:37] <%salty_syd913> big stabs
[2:00:38] <GarbageQueenEllie> Smol wiafu ftw
[2:00:40] <Retinolgaming> monkaS stabbing
[2:00:43] <+Fynale> Don't call it a redesign
[2:00:44] <+Lost_Zombie> She shanks and refuses to use the LB in dungeons
[2:00:45] <KatabolicRage> but pat it isn't the same character ;')
[2:00:45] <%doc_ock_rokc> @bestwaifuritsu terrible but hilarious
[2:00:47] <+StrawberryPantsu> I liked the butt window
[2:00:47] <BlueLunecy> She's already doing more than old Minfilia
[2:00:49] <jackythefrost> @upsidedown01 No its an MMO and you WILL have to do dungeons with other people even for the story
[2:00:50] <+lucaflow> Protect minifilia from the loli fans
[2:00:54] <ClumzyDragon> her weapon should be her own death flag
[2:00:54] <%rdark_ksu> you dont run you lumber
[2:00:58] <BunnyEmperor> Pat play with her in the second dungeon, she does something funny at the final boss
[2:00:59] <deviljhojho94> if you are not into kinkstabbing fuck off the edge of my dick
[2:00:59] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat rogue's have a natural move speed increase so that'd make sense
[2:00:59] <ScreamingMeat> Badass tiny women are the best
[2:01:08] <upsidedown01> @jackythefrost thanks

[2:01:22] <+meatgeneral69> hes got a fuckin chinese dragon
[2:01:26] <BunnyEmperor> Its fucking Gen
[2:01:27] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> reminds me of how Golbez has a dragon in IV
[2:01:31] <%Valdorick> Prepare for unwinnable boss fight!
[2:01:32] <upsidedown01> MURDER SQUAD GO :D
[2:01:32] <midnightmile> Old man gonna get wrekt
[2:01:33] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> also when is Golbez in FFXIV
[2:01:34] <JSebz> "My Fist in your Face Style"
[2:01:35] <%MyDarkStorm> OH NO
[2:01:43] <Foggysheep> your souls are mine!
[2:01:46] <%Lapinelis> He's basically zenos all over again
[2:01:51] <%Lapinelis> just less cool
[2:01:53] <+Implosivestar> So uh
[2:01:54] <+Fenlig> How could the devs design such a boss fight
[2:01:55] <%MyDarkStorm> He's Good
[2:01:56] <wrightlight94> gdqDragonRoar gdqDragonHi gdqDragonLo gdqDragonTail
[2:01:58] <Sol_Install> that HP bar monkaS
[2:01:58] <GarbageQueenEllie> Come, I'll let you try my Wu Tang style
[2:02:07] <SummonerMagno> show him your ass into foot style
[2:02:12] <KatabolicRage> this guy just comes at us with his three kingdoms bullshit
[2:02:12] <+Implosivestar> Been watching grappler baki with the stream in the back ground. what the hell am I watching
[2:02:14] <%Unlimited_> you're doing barely any damage
[2:02:17] <%FrustratedAF> so how about that Kung-Pow Enter the Fist
[2:02:20] <upsidedown01> @SummonerMagno Ass into foot?
[2:02:24] <jackythefrost> What was the name of Tifa's martial arts teacher again? I think this guy is a reference
[2:02:35] <%madhattergay> he looks like the MC of MK deception
[2:02:36] <upsidedown01> @SummonerMagno sounds innovative
[2:02:37] <AdmiralButtloaf> Zenos 2
[2:02:44] <deviljhojho94> The dude has a chinese myth dragon as a pet so this makes sense....
[2:02:46] <$valriot> I bet this dude is taken by a primal
[2:02:48] <gekizenbu> everyone getting blown up
[2:02:49] <ClumzyDragon> rips everyone
[2:02:49] <upsidedown01> are they knocked out :(
[2:02:50] <bestwaifuritsu> his number is bigger
[2:02:52] <%rdark_ksu> this is just a ton of flashing lights aint it
[2:02:53] <laserbeaming> Everyone is dead
[2:03:00] <+lucaflow> "It's just you and me....... and my dragon!"
[2:03:02] <upsidedown01> damn D:
[2:03:06] <ScreamingMeat> Did he just wipe out your party?
[2:03:12] <+TheImmortal70> A specialized monk
[2:03:12] <TioXyco> wait.... pat has a cape?!
[2:03:20] <%Valdorick> Triple Cast Rub
[2:03:22] <midnightmile> Pat is forced into that cape atm
[2:03:27] <+Masutasodo> Forced glam right now
[2:03:35] <+Implosivestar> man I wish Black Desert looked this smooth
[2:03:49] <+TheImmortal70> GUKUMATZ
[2:03:58] <JSebz> GUH-KUH-MATHS
[2:04:07] <ClumzyDragon> :o
[2:04:16] <robo_badger> Dude just does not die
[2:04:19] <laserbeaming> Is this scaled based on your role? Would a DPS get a less damaging version but with more health?
[2:04:20] <PerrinIsDead> This is some Dark Souls ass music
[2:04:29] <gekizenbu> you *will* learn
[2:04:30] <BlueLunecy> Alte Roite
[2:04:31] <BunnyEmperor> Deltascape
[2:04:31] <ricotez> Alte Roite
[2:04:31] <ClumzyDragon> ButterSauce dragon is gone ButterSauce
[2:04:33] <MoonObscure> and yet people won't learn....
[2:04:34] <+lucaflow> That's from Shinryu
[2:04:38] <+lucaflow> the pushback
[2:04:43] <upsidedown01> this is amazing and I'm glad to witness it
[2:04:44] <Welcome_To_YoAssThiccPark> mushu went shoo shoo
[2:04:44] <haerr> alte roite
[2:04:49] <midnightmile> Cmon Pat, he's just an OLD MAN
[2:04:51] <$valriot> Alt Right
[2:04:53] <upsidedown01> I would so very much die trying this game
[2:05:00] <%Valdorick> This music reminds me of the Shivan tracks from Freespace 2... and oh lawd did I pick an obscure refrence.
[2:05:04] <%SilvaChariot0133> Ye, instances are actually something now
[2:05:08] <%Lapinelis> They do overuse some mechanics a bit, "I'm kinda tired of "get behind cover to avoid meteor" mechanics
[2:05:19] <deviljhojho94> get iwbed berd
[2:05:19] <%SilvaChariot0133> It gets ROUGH later
[2:05:21] <+sixcubit> @AngriestPat you always talk about the complexity of boss fights, but nothing here looks unintuitive at all
[2:05:25] <midnightmile> Beatrix style
[2:05:26] <deviljhojho94> uh i mean get rekt nerd
[2:05:26] <+StrawberryPantsu> A tank buster?

[2:05:36] <Welcome_To_YoAssThiccPark> part of script?

[2:05:44] <%madhattergay> scripted?
[2:05:47] <%Valdorick> He hit you with Shock
[2:05:50] <$abluecardigan> mada mada
[2:05:50] <ClumzyDragon> plot attack :o
[2:05:54] <%Lapinelis> This is basically a worse Zenos
[2:05:55] <Zombiescantswim377> Pat lost because he didn't have his hat
[2:05:58] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> savage and ultimate is the tough stuff
[2:06:01] <upsidedown01> is he the boss you don't win against
[2:06:12] <%Kirijuo> How come at the start of every expansion has a guy who easily kicks your arse, despite the fact that you literally slay gods
[2:06:15] <%rdark_ksu> this dude is coming to take over your dojo
[2:06:15] <deviljhojho94> i touguht that was a chick wtf
[2:06:24] <+Artemis_Scowl> He hit you with the plot sword lol
[2:06:27] <%Lapinelis> @sixcubit There's a difference in watching this, and doing this while keeping track of your rotations, teammates etc
[2:06:27] <midnightmile> Mr Shakedown but old
[2:06:33] <Retinolgaming> Oh nooo it's Guan yu
[2:06:33] <jackythefrost> THANCRED
[2:06:33] <+StrawberryPantsu> WHATER BOI
[2:06:36] <upsidedown01> @Kirijuo It's the "knock out Worf" trope

[2:06:57] <TioXyco> It's Dante Lionhart from Devil may Fantasy VIII
[2:07:01] <upsidedown01> @Kirijuo If the new guy can just DECK the strongest guy on your team straight out, that's an indication of how much a threat he is
[2:07:11] <ClumzyDragon> who will win anime bull shit or anime bull shit? :O
[2:07:12] <%madhattergay> thats literally just squall

[2:13:10] <Thenuclearwalrus> Thancred got rid of his daggers in favor of the power of G U N
[2:13:17] <Foggysheep> no shes basically a cardboard cut out
[2:13:22] <ClumzyDragon> no waifu is to pure to talk

[2:13:39] <upsidedown01> that dude is a weird Squall-Seifer cross-class

[2:14:18] <+EvilSoully> Fae are never nice.

[2:14:40] <laserbeaming> Fae are usually sadists of some kind
[2:14:41] <+Lost_Zombie> they're dicks till they like you and sometimes still dicks
[2:14:44] <gekizenbu> the only thing more worse than fae is Urianger's vocabulary
[2:14:52] <ClumzyDragon> the hat is the true hero of this story
[2:14:52] <+EastwindGuru> Where the Gunblades and dancing bitties at?!
[2:15:00] <%shadybarman> the hat is as ugly as paiges stripper boots
[2:15:15] <%madhattergay> you think theyll make a dad of light crossover event?
[2:15:16] <%Valdorick> She sensed you and splooshed
[2:15:17] <upsidedown01> Are her pupils magic or something

[2:15:36] <etbarni> shes just in awe of the hat... you can see it in her eyes

[2:17:33] <laserbeaming> The PLOT is thick in this area and it clouds her memory
[2:17:43] <%Faustgesicht> Paige is lost right now
[2:17:43] <GarbageQueenEllie> You should play with the fae, they'll like you and you can get drunk
[2:17:47] <%ovan20> @AngriestPat wasn't Paige that lived 6 months in japan and still took the wrong trains? :P
[2:17:48] <PerrinIsDead> yo my girl has no spacial awareness
[2:17:56] <%fredbet96> yo mum

[2:18:21] <+TONYOO101> oh no, not the monstergirls
[2:18:33] <+meatgeneral69> remember this in 2 hours, this place is a good spot to drop a black rose bomb
[2:18:40] <+Sklaveritter> Yes the monstergirls
[2:18:56] <Prism_Wing> Or a shitscene
[2:18:58] <baesoora> why are the chocos broken
[2:19:03] <+Eric_Spells_Rice> it's Quelaag
[2:19:05] <Meowff> Hows Shadowbringers so far?
[2:19:07] <upsidedown01> @baesoora Brokobo
[2:19:13] <etbarni> superfog?

[2:19:26] <ShichiNoBushi> It's adorable.
[2:19:26] <%VantomPayne> smol
[2:19:27] <Foggysheep> the zone is covered in dank pixie weed
[2:19:28] <%Tenebrae94> didn't par end the everlasting light?
[2:19:29] <baesoora> flower basket????
[2:19:36] <%Tenebrae94> *pat
[2:19:39] <baesoora> Im so confused by this expansion

[2:19:44] <mayorrev> did pat find those big mutant cactuars yet
[2:19:44] <FirewallStorm> that is one beefy flower basket
[2:19:48] <%VanaSkiller> atpButtHash
[2:19:50] <ShichiNoBushi> Pixies hotboxed the whole zone.
[2:20:03] <Zebroneath> They're model looks like the mushroom people from Dark Souls.
[2:20:09] <%madhattergay> memories of mushroom men in dark souls
[2:20:19] <Maverick2736> you know this place is dangerous when even the weed wants to punch you in the face
[2:20:20] <%Piemono> I don't know if I like that Choco-horse thing
[2:20:23] <upsidedown01> Why does the chocobo armor look like unnecessary horse legs
[2:20:23] <%Valdorick> Gotta get dat dank pixie weed
[2:20:31] <Jolnir> we have the exact same chocobo
[2:20:44] <etbarni> does the chocobo have fake horse legs incorporated into the armor?
[2:20:50] <%Roundelay11> You can dye it
[2:20:54] <%Roundelay11> the cloak at least
[2:21:04] <%yeknomlive> that looks like type 0 armor
[2:21:06] <DevinMayCry> This is where DRK learns the new move "Infanticide" right?
[2:21:08] <etbarni> hell yeah
[2:21:08] <artoflec> disgusting
[2:21:10] <upsidedown01> oh! Odin
[2:21:20] <ShichiNoBushi> Must horribly unbalance it.
[2:21:27] <upsidedown01> Odin summon has extraneous horse legs so that sort of makes sense

[2:25:10] <+vizzay> Yeah dungeons have been really fun so far
[2:25:16] <+valkuma> TESLEEN BibleThump

[2:25:22] <+TONYOO101> Second one is great oo
[2:25:23] <GarbageQueenEllie> The pregnant meme reminds me of how that one woman in family guy was preggers for like 10 years
[2:25:24] <%Roundelay11> the Il Mheg dungeon is real pretty
[2:25:25] <FingerMuffin> this is like a legis ff game after lvl 50
[2:25:25] <%JimmyShoeLaces> this looks like a proper MMO, very nice
[2:25:26] <%Ixiah> switch to Dancer you coward
[2:25:27] <$valriot> 75 takes a MASSIVE shit on the trash that is Bardams
[2:25:33] <+Lost_Zombie> @AngriestPat 73 dungeon is really good too but lots of people are gonna mess up mechanics
[2:25:33] <%damienlunas> Seeing pat play that first dungeon really played a huge part in dragging me back in.
[2:25:36] <IminyourBase> put on the moogle hat
[2:25:43] <DevinMayCry> lol. I saw someone in my game saying "At least Lyse isnt here"
[2:25:46] <ShichiNoBushi> Teh Bard

[2:26:39] <JoveGar> boots are too much
[2:26:49] <ShichiNoBushi> So much edge it's double-edge.
[2:26:50] <FingerMuffin> kindgom heart straps
[2:26:55] <upsidedown01> Too edgy is when your sword hilt is covered in thorns and your hands never heal
[2:27:02] <+Fynale> So yeah this expansion reeks of the fact taht SE isn't stealing ff14's budget for other projects anymore
[2:27:03] <Onillius> look at this Scottish fuck
[2:27:07] <IminyourBase> hat is red

[2:27:29] <ricotez> ayy pat you got the namazu earring too?
[2:27:29] <%GarbageNirvana> But then apatSmoked would be irrelevant
[2:27:36] <FingerMuffin> if u want some edge go with blakc n brown
[2:27:41] <ricotez> now I don't feel like I wasted my time getting that
[2:27:42] <IminyourBase> dye the sword
[2:27:53] <%GarbageNirvana> I dig it
[2:27:56] <icosahedralAPOI> the woolie sword
[2:28:02] <ShichiNoBushi> Purple is the color of royalty.
[2:28:05] <JoveGar> dye it red
[2:28:06] <%GarbageNirvana> Not shiny enough
[2:28:07] <ClumzyDragon> dye the hat blue and just say it is purple
[2:28:17] <Thenuclearwalrus> @ClumzyDragon LUL
[2:28:17] <+valkuma> i dont know if its possible for rogueadyn to look good. their bodies are too comically proportioned
[2:28:24] <%shadybarman> hat ruins it
[2:28:32] <upsidedown01> Hat makes it
[2:28:37] <Thenuclearwalrus> Pat: "I know what Purple is" [X] Doubt
[2:28:39] <FingerMuffin> most ppl dont know what purple is funfact
[2:28:41] <%Roundelay11> A real shame about Pat's color blindness

[2:29:51] <DevinMayCry> Oh wait. Paissa sounds like piss and the 1st Paissa are called Pooka.
[2:29:58] <upsidedown01> this beat is actually really nice
[2:30:06] <%GarbageNirvana> Thancred always had a crush on Minfilia in one form or another
[2:30:21] <DevinMayCry> Thancred is Wolverine at this point
[2:30:39] <%GarbageNirvana> But yeah I think now it's more like an Old Man Logan scenario
[2:30:54] <GarbageQueenEllie> I wonder if you can cuck Thancred... that'd be hilarious
[2:31:38] <upsidedown01> @GarbageQueenEllie what, like, bang his spouse while he watches crying in the corner?
[2:31:51] <%GarbageNirvana> Trying not to spoil myself too much so I'm finding myself muting/minimizing quite a bit in this stream
[2:32:20] <+valkuma> i love the new thancred
[2:32:25] <$rekinom> Snape kills Minfillia with rosebud
[2:32:29] <GarbageQueenEllie> @upsidedown01 I don't know, maybe? I'd just love some drama with the smol knifu waifu, rather than her just standing there giving exposition
[2:32:33] <%GarbageNirvana> ...goddammit
[2:33:07] <JoeStillLife> D:
[2:33:10] <+valkuma> D:
[2:33:14] <%NWR_James> nah
[2:33:25] <upsidedown01> @GarbageQueenEllie maybe it's me being confused, I always thought "cuck" just meant the usual kind of cuckolding, now it means something absolutely undefined
[2:33:41] <$Afterman_> who doesnt know crazy legs
[2:33:51] <%GarbageNirvana> I never liked the term myself because of how it got popularized in the first place
[2:33:53] <alrobot2014> how many faeries has pat rubbed this time?
[2:33:54] <+valkuma> upsidedown01 as a verb its used more like "get shot down" or "get denied"
[2:34:15] <upsidedown01> @valkuma ahhh, "get smoked" :D
[2:34:21] <ExpressNode> I know I see the steam summer sale going on but doesn't it seem underwhelming compared to the past ones or is that just me?
[2:34:22] <GarbageQueenEllie> @upsidedown01 I think it still means the same thing, just exaggerated. Like, if you know he likes a girl, but you go ahead and date her anyway, like an asshole
[2:34:38] <count_bob> "Lookin for some dank kush!"
[2:34:51] <ShichiNoBushi> World of Darkness fae are huge jerks.
[2:34:53] <upsidedown01> @GarbageQueenEllie ...that is a profoundly strange thing to want to do to someone, or to be proud that you have done to someone
[2:34:55] <StripesUltimateEdition> speak to the fae or riot
[2:35:05] <%Zepik> hey fairy, you holdin?
[2:35:16] <Jolnir> do not fucking talk to any of these assholes
[2:35:19] <count_bob> Are you a cop fairy?
[2:35:21] <upsidedown01> Search for a kind of grass?
[2:35:21] <+Sum_White_Guy> an old man needs you to go gather some strange grass that allows him to see pixies
[2:35:24] <upsidedown01> Fairy is a shitty dealer
[2:35:25] <+Sum_White_Guy> sure old man sure
[2:35:29] <count_bob> You gotta tell me if you're a cop!
[2:35:36] <%Razputin217> he was trying to FUCK ON ME
[2:35:44] <upsidedown01> Well, you grind it up, and then
[2:35:47] <GarbageQueenEllie> @upsidedown01 It's awful. But in a comedic scenario, it can give way to lots of good memes
[2:36:02] <SaltyAzteca> AEW PogChamp
[2:36:10] <+valkuma> its a looking glass
[2:36:11] <upsidedown01> what the shit

[2:38:02] <+valkuma> this realm is so whimsical and c ute honestly
[2:38:10] <GarbageQueenEllie> My kind of gal
[2:38:17] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat so these fae are based upon a midsummer's night dream so they're very agender and such so they're all basically ass holes
[2:38:17] <upsidedown01> How do they taste with mustard
[2:38:22] <%yeknomlive> allisae looking for that lb bar again
[2:38:24] <jackythefrost> Oh god no, Minfilia makes a FFXII reference later on
[2:38:25] <ExpressNode> You could just pluck their wings

[2:38:33] <$Afterman_> eat them all pat
[2:38:36] <+Fynale> except the nu mou they're good bois

[2:38:47] <%damienlunas> Get me some cheese, bitch.
[2:38:56] <+valkuma> im act the exact same point in the story as pat and its literally pixie chores.
[2:39:04] <+Lost_Zombie> @AngriestPat Just tell them what you wanted to do to the other Fairy and I'm sure they'll let you out
[2:39:06] <jackythefrost> Its time for Fairy Quests Pat, ARE YOU READY?
[2:39:07] <%NWR_James> Welcome these pixies are your people now
[2:39:15] <ExpressNode> Imagine if this game had some fairy vore
[2:39:16] <%NeonTurnip> wait pixies are just pat , small, irish and liars
[2:39:20] <%Gogogolem> This whole zone is amazing
[2:39:22] <GarbageQueenEllie> I love mischievous spirits. They're such huge assholes. It's such fun
[2:39:29] <PerrinIsDead> Yo this shit dumb
[2:39:29] <%Roundelay11> Well, yeah
[2:39:34] <$rekinom> I wonder what deep fried pixie tastes like
[2:39:42] <%Roundelay11> There's no reason not to use it
[2:39:47] <alrobot2014> don't leave pat with the fairies, they'll make him do chores, the bane of his littering
[2:39:58] <%Zepik> become thor
[2:40:01] <IminyourBase> put it on coward
[2:40:17] <%luftraumm1> looks like a dork
[2:40:20] <depressedpepega> BALD! BALD!
[2:40:20] <+vizzay> Thor but bald, the strongest move
[2:40:23] <+valkuma> That helmet would be sick on an Elezen
[2:40:25] <$Afterman_> helmet is best part
[2:40:27] <JoveGar> love is a strong word
[2:40:27] <IminyourBase> no it's a combo deal you take the chest and the hat or no deal
[2:40:28] <count_bob> Do would you say....
[2:40:28] <+Sgt_Wigglytuff> the helmet would look better if you had hair
[2:40:30] <Applecannon63> Love the chest
[2:40:32] <count_bob> Amazing chest ahead!?
[2:40:33] <%doc_ock_rokc> I'm glad the music cut out for that clip pat
[2:40:37] <corrosivePaladin> God that looks terrible
[2:40:40] <%Roundelay11> The SAM version from that chest looks like boring garbo
[2:40:54] <ShichiNoBushi> If only you could attach those ornaments to your hat.
[2:40:59] <$rekinom> Everyone point at his hat and LAUGH
[2:40:59] <%sshen> WHMs is a big whiff too
[2:41:00] <jackythefrost> Pat your baldness is showing
[2:41:09] <PerrinIsDead> Amazing chest ahead
[2:41:19] <+valkuma> like the japanese phone charms, just dangle ornaments from your helmet
[2:41:53] <Huntercd> @AngriestPat you going to be muscle cat?
[2:42:14] <Applecannon63> Pat is not furry?
[2:42:26] <jackythefrost> Catboy with the body of a Roe
[2:42:26] <+valkuma> muscle cat is a big pretty kitty
[2:42:42] <jackythefrost> Thats the one Im using
[2:42:43] <ShichiNoBushi> Pixie Merchant! I require your strongest pixies.
[2:42:52] <GarbageQueenEllie> Nothing feels more satisfying than outsmarting a smarmy pixie.
[2:42:54] <TheCoolerbluefooddye> I'm going into battle, and I need your strongest equipment
[2:43:17] <+Kashishh> how long did it take you for stormbringers
[2:43:22] <%GarbageNirvana> Following the same trend of high-end raid gear carrying you about 5 levels in I see
[2:43:24] <+valkuma> I'm sorry my dear knight, you cannot handle my strongest equipment.
[2:43:27] <+Kashishh> im trying to get through it now
[2:43:30] <+valkuma> I suggest seeking weaker blacksmiths
[2:43:47] <%trillmagical> Hows it only been 2:42 hour long stream
[2:43:47] <+Can_Do_Kamel> so is shadowbringers living up to the hype?
[2:43:57] <%trillmagical> its feel like its been up since the morning
[2:44:02] <GarbageQueenEllie> Elmo a birb
[2:44:06] <+valkuma> its been good to me so far, except that i used to main scholar and its unplayable now.
[2:44:07] <gothgaming666> I've just came in from a DMC stream and the first thing I see on here is"Dark Knight"
[2:44:20] <Applecannon63> shadowbringers were you vore angels and gods to bring back the night
[2:44:48] <+StrawberryPantsu> @AngriestPat You haven't even played GNB bro... I shit you not hitting that 70 combo is like MAX ACTING every hit with Nero...
[2:45:06] <jackythefrost> 73 dungeon was amazing
[2:45:19] <Onillius> @AngriestPat my cat-man would called minamus the mighty but his friend would call him minmo
[2:46:23] <+Can_Do_Kamel> call me corny, but I love the occasional lazy saturday french accordion music.
[2:46:37] <%doc_ock_rokc> Poor chocobo is so inbreed it has hooves
[2:47:03] <%GarbageNirvana> poor horsebird
[2:47:05] <+valkuma> OH THERES SWIMMING
[2:47:14] <ShichiNoBushi> Chocomo
[2:47:32] <GarbageQueenEllie> Dead people
[2:47:55] <SpookyCarnage> Apparently I have to go through 200-ish MSQs in Stormblood to get to Shadowbringers, and I don't get my SB key until the 2nd. Feels bad man
[2:48:13] <%GarbageNirvana> oof
[2:48:48] <+valkuma> Damn those irish and their 1 foot tall heighs, and leaf covered bodies
[2:49:00] <DevinMayCry> You get 2 whole expansions to play then though Spooky
[2:49:13] <GarbageQueenEllie> Keeeeeeyyyyn
[2:49:14] <SpookyCarnage> Yeah I can't wait for that gripping ala mhigo storyline moon2B
[2:49:33] <suikudo> I hate these idiots
[2:49:33] <+valkuma> yeah i bought the lore skip for stormblood
[2:49:41] <+valkuma> it took me 400 hours to get through ARR and heavensward
[2:49:55] <+EvilSoully> How to distinguish between male and female pixies: The REALLY effeminate ones are male.
[2:50:07] <DevinMayCry> I dont think they have a gender
[2:50:08] <%SilvaChariot0133> PogChamp
[2:50:18] <%SilvaChariot0133> woolieYE
[2:50:21] <Kghaleon> @valkuma I'm struggling through it now. Probably 200 hours and I'm almost done with ARR
[2:50:21] <%doc_ock_rokc> ITS PAT
[2:50:21] <upsidedown01> awww
[2:50:22] <GarbageQueenEllie> @EvilSoully That's so true it hurts
[2:50:24] <alrobot2014> oh my god that is precious
[2:50:28] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> the pixies use they I think
[2:50:28] <SpookyCarnage> It's like a walrus-hamster
[2:50:30] <DevinMayCry> Joseph speak beaver
[2:50:30] <%salty_syd913> awwwww
[2:50:32] <%Kazooki_Kazami> LOOK AT IT
[2:50:32] <upsidedown01> BEAVER SPEAK AHAHAHAH
[2:50:36] <parkslady> awwww
[2:50:36] <SaltyAzteca> look at the little teeth
[2:50:36] <+valkuma> Kghaleon i would have told you to skip ARR if you could.
[2:50:37] <%NWR_James> I want to see it grow up big and strong
[2:50:38] <suikudo> vampire hamster
[2:50:39] <%nikoloas_> TOO CUTE GONNA DIE
[2:50:40] <%weissguard> I want one.
[2:50:42] <%kenpachi9211> LOOK ITS PAT
[2:50:42] <%FrogCatapult> Food
[2:50:42] <upsidedown01> this is the best game in the world
[2:50:42] <mayorrev> LIL CHONKY BOI
[2:50:43] <+Sgt_Wigglytuff> get that bitch some milk
[2:50:44] <haveswordmuststing> carve it for its pelts
[2:50:49] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> Pat I didm't know you spoke beaver
[2:50:51] <+ninebreaker6> now kill it
[2:50:51] <haveswordmuststing> make it into armor
[2:50:51] <alrobot2014> if that thing dies then fuck the first
[2:50:54] <+valkuma> Kghaleon if youre considering at ALL the possibility of buying a lore skip, do it now instead of later. It skips EVERYTHING
[2:50:55] <$Afterman_> feed the baby
[2:51:06] <$Afterman_> rip
[2:51:20] <Kghaleon> @valkuma I'll see it through, but I definitely don't feel the lore was worth while.
[2:51:23] <$Afterman_> this battle music is so good
[2:51:35] <%trillmagical> i fucking love the fat black chocobo
[2:51:38] <upsidedown01> Elmo is best chocobodin
[2:51:38] <%trillmagical> so much
[2:51:42] <+valkuma> Kghaleon Heavensward had great lore. ARR was only good at like the last 1/4th or something
[2:51:59] <Huntercd> @ItsYaGirlMaria of course Pat speaks beaver he is Canadian
[2:52:28] <%Kazooki_Kazami> Kazooki_Kazami subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 16 months! How are you finding drk so far? I'm considering on levelling one since it's just WAR with ogcd damage abilities and with mana management
[2:52:37] <+killer_squid1990> Oh is pat at the beaver quest
[2:52:40] <SpookyCarnage> @valkuma ARR was good till I think around 2.3-2.4, then it picked up again after 2.4. Dumb political intrigue plotline
[2:53:15] <+valkuma> Scholars are DESTROYED and i was a scholar main
[2:53:16] <%Kazooki_Kazami> YUP
[2:53:20] <%Roundelay11> SAM is mostly the same
[2:53:24] <%Kazooki_Kazami> some Monks aren't happy though
[2:53:27] <+vizzay> I am still a SCH main, not a good time tbh
[2:53:30] <%SilvaChariot0133> monk's single target is Eh, but loving the new AoE shit O_o
[2:53:33] <count_bob> What happened with Astros?
[2:53:35] <suikudo> Monk feels awful right now
[2:53:36] <+StrawberryPantsu> FIX SCH AND AST SO I CAN GET MY INSTANT Tank ques
[2:53:39] <%SilvaChariot0133> RIP Tornado Kick tho
[2:53:52] <count_bob> Oooof.
[2:53:52] <+TONYOO101> they made AST draw/play skill so clunky :*(
[2:53:56] <+valkuma> not only that but they made the astro cards really lackluster.
[2:53:57] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> wait a bug?
[2:53:59] <wheeely> what bug
[2:54:05] <+Fynale> this zone is full of feels later on
[2:54:06] <SpookyCarnage> You can't queue play or something
[2:54:12] <redrins> also the buffs are way too boring now
[2:54:13] <+valkuma> the "Play" skill is bugged out really bad
[2:54:15] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> oooo fuck
[2:54:16] <%Kazooki_Kazami> i have an other monk friend who finds the aoe stuff braindead lol
[2:54:25] <%Kazooki_Kazami> but fireball is cool
[2:54:36] <DevinMayCry> THE AOE addition to MNK added a lot actually
[2:54:40] <%sshen> squirtles
[2:54:40] <%Roundelay11> Honestly, SAM is feeling a bit boring. Makes me want to level NIN.
[2:54:41] <+TONYOO101> oh thank god, I was worried it was supposed to be like that
[2:54:46] <+valkuma> I chose Bard to level up and it feels fun because i never played dps before
[2:54:48] <DevinMayCry> The upkeep of twin snakes makes it best to use on 2 enemies
[2:54:52] <DevinMayCry> In your rotation
[2:54:52] <ShichiNoBushi> Draw! Monsuta kaado!!
[2:54:56] <%SilvaChariot0133> It's braindead for sure, but that it tears through shit is great
[2:55:03] <+valkuma> Viera 7 is HILARIOUS
[2:55:06] <%SilvaChariot0133> it's just a maet grinder on pulls
[2:55:08] <SpookyCarnage> I'm curious to see how much Bard has changed since I last played in HW
[2:55:09] <%SilvaChariot0133> *meat
[2:55:15] <wheeely> fucking hank hill with bunny ears
[2:55:16] <KatabolicRage> well not anymore they aint
[2:55:17] <+Fynale> They're scarecrows
[2:55:17] <+EvilSoully> they WERE
[2:55:18] <alrobot2014> its like a zombie walking around and crying
[2:55:22] <+StrawberryPantsu> Viera in their default bottoms ever so slightly have bigger asses than the rest of the female races
[2:55:26] <%doc_ock_rokc> pat this is the land of the fey. The lest questions asked the better
[2:55:31] <+Fynale> they're made by the fae to play house with
[2:55:31] <Kghaleon> isn't that what old ladies sound like?
[2:55:33] <+StrawberryPantsu> It's kinda unfair...
[2:55:37] <%Faustgesicht> If a WHM wanted to start DPS, what would be a good class to pick?
[2:55:41] <+valkuma> *** Viera 7
[2:55:58] <+valkuma> @Faustgesicht i would say Dancer since its brand spanking new
[2:55:58] <%sshen> they sell your riding maps for speed once you complete enough
[2:56:00] <+Fynale> tier 2 of the fate stuff will let you get the riding map
[2:56:02] <DevinMayCry> Theres positionals in the AOE combo for monk sort of too. 2 of your AOE moves are good in middle of mob, 2 outside of mob
[2:56:02] <+StrawberryPantsu> @Faustgesicht WAR (:^)) or DRG
[2:56:07] <snowmanse> Fates are reputation now
[2:56:09] <$valriot> A lot of skills feel like they're missing audio, especially GNB, there's no sound on Burst Strikes explosion @angriestpat
[2:56:09] <+StrawberryPantsu> Or RDM
[2:56:13] <+Masutasodo> oh yea if you do 6 fates you can get a riding map for the area
[2:56:21] <%doc_ock_rokc> NOTHING
[2:56:26] <+StrawberryPantsu> RDM is easy to pick up and fun @Faustgesicht
[2:56:39] <KatabolicRage> alliance seals are the worst to get
[2:56:46] <Thenuclearwalrus> @AngriestPat How are you enjoying worse-moogles?
[2:56:51] <+Fynale> they don't give you faster flight speed
[2:57:01] <SailingSaturn> LUL
[2:57:08] <%nikoloas_> the fae are fucked up man
[2:57:08] <%doc_ock_rokc> These are the fae pat.
[2:57:17] <%Mekhet09> Pat it's going to get worse.
[2:57:18] <alrobot2014> when are tiny people not evil in this game
[2:57:22] <%NWR_James> It's their culture!
[2:57:25] <%king_wragles> why fake horse legs on bird?
[2:57:28] <%doc_ock_rokc> This is why I want a "Darksouls" of just the fae!
[2:57:31] <GarbageQueenEllie> food
[2:57:31] <%ryome> You aren’t allowed to touch my penis anymore, fae!
[2:57:33] <DevinMayCry> Because its slepnir
[2:57:33] <+valkuma> Elves are only good for one thing ?
[2:57:34] <Thenuclearwalrus> monkaS ?
[2:57:41] <+desfore> If pat has the Motorcycle, he should use it. It's always max mount speed
[2:57:44] <alrobot2014> that look did not bode well pat
[2:57:46] <+Internet_Jorge> whens the quest to grind their bones into flour
[2:57:56] <$rekinom> Are people enjoying gunbreaker?
[2:58:01] <$valriot> all tanks are amazing
[2:58:01] <Kghaleon> I just hit 50 and I was sad to see that dark knight was still 100 quests away
[2:58:03] <+meatgeneral69> just drop a black rose right here
[2:58:12] <+killer_squid1990> Noooo the Beaver quest is super funny
[2:58:14] <%Roundelay11> Is it true that the motorcycle is just faster than every other mount?
[2:58:24] <%doc_ock_rokc> Elves are wonderful. They provoke wonder. Elves are marvellous. They cause marvels. Elves are fantastic. They create fantasies. Elves are glamorous. They project glamour. Elves are enchanting. They weave enchantment. Elves are terrific. They beget terror. The thing about words is that meanings can twist just like a snake, and if you want to find snakes look for them behind words that have changed their meaning. No one ever said elves are nice. Elves are bad. - Sir Terry Pratchet
[2:58:25] <DevinMayCry> It has the speed upgrade automatically
[2:58:26] <%king_wragles> WAIT, if horses don't exist in FF someone needs to explain to me why those horse legs were even thought of
[2:58:31] <%Roundelay11> Thats bullshit
[2:58:35] <DevinMayCry> There are horses
[2:58:36] <Thenuclearwalrus> @Roundelay11 It has the speed upgrades from riding mounts automatically
[2:58:43] <Thenuclearwalrus> @Roundelay11 But only on the ground
[2:58:46] <laserbeaming> Do you think they screw over classes on purpose for some dumb reason? I always hear of some class being fucked every expansion
[2:58:51] <%extrwi> unicorns exist
[2:58:52] <+desfore> The motorcycle is set at the max speed. So, it's only faster if you don't have the maps
[2:59:16] <+valkuma> Peenyus
[2:59:23] <laserbeaming> Edge of Edgelord
[2:59:34] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> there's ALWAYS broken job at expansion launch
[2:59:38] <+vizzay> Wait if there is no horses how do they determine how many horse power the vehicles have?
[2:59:48] <%doc_ock_rokc> @king_wragles Oden has a horse which they copied
[2:59:55] <upsidedown01> @vizzay chocopower
[3:00:02] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> MCH was even bad all the HW
[3:00:03] <%Rax777> Rax777 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months! 
[3:00:13] <+vizzay> This baby has 500 chocopower
[3:00:19] <GarbageQueenEllie> That's DARK

[3:16:13] <TioXyco> It's the old book's faults
[3:16:13] <alrobot2014> urianger has to talk like that because he's trying to avoid spoilers from reading the skript
[3:16:14] <Jolnir> pat was the party kid at school and also the weed dealer
[3:16:15] <upsidedown01> Urianger is fantasy-ese for "cryptic fuck"

[3:17:53] <%king_wragles> and to finish taking the piss, what's the metric system like in this game?
[3:17:58] <GarbageQueenEllie> Live by the sword, die by the death style
[3:18:01] <DevinMayCry> The source is imperial, the first uses metric
[3:18:02] <%terminallyCapriciousz> Yalms > Malms > Ilms Yards > Miles > Inches

[3:19:28] <AdmiralButtloaf> its the same outfit for everyone
[3:19:28] <BunnyEmperor> Rip hat
[3:19:28] <KatabolicRage> I had the same outfit on in that, I think it just shoves you in those clothes
[3:19:28] <+desfore> That's the Traveler armor Tataru gave you
[3:19:30] <wheeely> it uses that gear for everybody
[3:19:30] <%yeknomlive> it's their new auto glamour tech
[3:19:32] <%Lapinelis> Haticide
[3:19:34] <snowmanse> You think a snapshot and not just default pick that outfit?
[3:19:39] <TioXyco> probably when you took the first quest of the expac
[3:19:41] <ClumzyDragon> no hat is ever really gone
[3:20:00] <etbarni> only in certain cutscenes....
[3:20:01] <AdmiralButtloaf> canon hero outfit
[3:20:25] <GarbageQueenEllie> A lot of people ship Black Rose, man
[3:20:37] <%Gogogolem> It really works with my hero, who i think is an idiot.
[3:20:38] <SailingSaturn> @AngriestPat its like we're a real charcter cirISee

[3:22:47] <$Yakobro> LUL
[3:22:47] <haveswordmuststing> Reconect
[3:22:53] <%Mekhet09> No You didn't.
[3:22:54] <+Fynale> we originally didn't know what element bahamut's calamity was attuned to

[3:22:56] <haveswordmuststing> Kingdom Hearts
[3:22:58] <SailingSaturn> no you didn't pat LUL
[3:23:01] <@SpaceCaptainCrone> It's like SMT order and chaos
[3:23:01] <DevinMayCry> They have light and dark reversed here basically
[3:23:02] <+Fynale> we now know it was darkness cuz the elements went crazy
[3:23:03] <+desfore> it's backwards
[3:23:03] <BunnyEmperor> Yeah they have it written in english but with a custom font
[3:23:06] <parkslady> DARKNESS
[3:23:12] <%heckyell> kingdom hearts is LIGHT
[3:23:18] <%Valdorick> Okay, back from my bullshit; Pat fuck a Fey yet?
[3:23:20] <$NitronStreams> Darkness is the friends we made along the way
[3:23:20] <GarbageQueenEllie> It's backwards, just like the food pyramid
[3:23:26] <Rentixx> Were the edgelords secretly holy paladins this whole time?!
[3:23:28] <DevinMayCry> Darkness in the source is claimed to be passive, and light active but they recognize it the other way ont he first due to how they came to discover the elements
[3:23:32] <IminyourBase> do you think he gets up every morning and puts all that shit on?
[3:23:39] <%yeknomlive> now i gotta watch every prozd kingdom hearts vid
[3:23:40] <alrobot2014> no but feo ul told him to make a booty call once in a while

[3:24:05] <DevinMayCry> Because aether bad
[3:24:07] <+TheImmortal70> If people die and the land die, there's no chance life can come back
[3:24:19] <SailingSaturn> its having no aether is bad
[3:24:20] <+TheImmortal70> So it's a DOUBLE calamity
[3:24:27] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> building up to patch msq maybe
[3:24:36] <%Valdorick> Its a Race War Bomb
[3:24:36] <SailingSaturn> @AngriestPat well the scions bodies are still on the source cirISee
[3:24:48] <IminyourBase> this guy fucks pixies
[3:24:49] <metrying> this guy talks like a medival yoda
[3:24:50] <%Gogogolem> I just saw a lalafel with 3 Viera in the car spinning in the middle of town yelling pimping aint easy.
[3:24:52] <TioXyco> Urianger without the robe coering his face looks cool AF
[3:24:53] <thwak> LUL

[3:25:16] <GarbageQueenEllie> That's what chat is
[3:25:18] <BunnyEmperor> Keep going
[3:25:18] <SailingSaturn> Clip it Chat cirREE
[3:25:21] <DevinMayCry> Interacting is hard
[3:25:22] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat , admitting you have a problem is the first step.
[3:25:22] <IminyourBase> listen DSP, you go for the easy joke it's fine
[3:25:27] <$OranHexthief> thats really bad when you remember that they are supposedly the souls of dead children pat LUL
[3:25:28] <%meltdown547> "Now"?
[3:25:31] <Shwepie> You said it because it's in the script.
[3:25:32] <ExpressNode> I've gotten used to it so I don't find it strange
[3:25:33] <graemecrackers1> Yay
[3:25:34] <star87if> Will Pat be uploading the FFXIV stream on youtube??

[3:25:54] <SailingSaturn> Chug the Purple Carrot Juice cirBaka
[3:25:57] <%Shady_Squid> Been streamin a long time. Over a long enough course of time everyone eventually talks about fairy dicks
[3:26:03] <%TheSniperJoe> He's been working out, look at THOSE GUNS.
[3:26:04] <alrobot2014> flirt with all they hot elf boys
[3:26:09] <graemecrackers1> Pat did you lose weight ?!
[3:26:13] <+valkuma> Did he replace himself with a god of lust
[3:26:17] <+Sum_White_Guy> charno subs in my angry man stream? thorwOh
[3:26:22] <%terminallyCapriciousz> Urianger speaks like this because it gives him a hardon
[3:26:29] <+valkuma> cirBaka
[3:26:37] <+DZiffer> The Pixies are the best
[3:26:42] <SailingSaturn> @Sum_White_Guy @valkuma cirPat
[3:26:44] <+desfore> ***
[3:26:45] <BunnyEmperor> Urianger is related to Haanit
[3:26:48] <GarbageQueenEllie> Give them a giant cake in the shape of a middle finger. They'll love it
[3:26:59] <%yeknomlive> no tataru to clean the place up
[3:27:06] <%Shady_Squid> Don't suck that Pixies dick.
[3:27:09] <+DZiffer> You have to kill the moonlight butterfly!
[3:27:32] <graemecrackers1> has endgame beat avatar yet ?
[3:27:37] <$Afterman_> ive got some weeds 4 u
[3:27:37] <Greggthegrim> hey pat how does dark knight feel/look? have been playing warrior and most of the stuff they got in the expac looked like shit
[3:27:46] <TioXyco> who needs weeds? you already see the faeries
[3:27:52] <ShichiNoBushi> That what they've been smoking to fog up this place?
[3:28:06] <%Nikopol1717> Stalwart Soul looks fantastic
[3:28:10] <%TheSniperJoe> Flood/Edge of Shadow's upgrade looks REALLY nice when you get it.
[3:28:11] <%Lapinelis> How you liking the battle theme? I like it, but it feels as if it belongs in a different game to me
[3:28:13] <+EvilSoully> Getting High Jump makes Dragoon feel SO much nicer
[3:28:13] <BunnyEmperor> DRK has gotten the most care it seems
[3:28:22] <+Pyr0_Fr0st> Hhi N\
[3:28:45] <SailingSaturn> @AngriestPat doesn't this feel like way more of a Final Fantasy Game? cirSlain
[3:28:47] <%TheSniperJoe> DRK got a lot of love for sure but I'm pretty sure MCH got the most care.
[3:28:51] <floatRand> Really liking machinist. Just kinda bummed that SCH and AST got shit on (although SCH healing kit is obscenely good).
[3:28:53] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat someone datamined the remix of escape from the job skill trailer and it's fucking dope
[3:29:00] <floatRand> ...There are still problems with MCH, but it is super-fun
[3:29:10] <+DZiffer> If there was less water this would be a Dark Souls area
[3:29:16] <ShichiNoBushi> Swim for me, doggo.
[3:29:20] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat clipping issues apperently
[3:29:32] <TioXyco> HW plot is kinda FFT
[3:29:34] <KatabolicRage> honestly being fun to save a job with problems, old mch was both bad and unfun
[3:29:41] <%Lapinelis> HW was good, SB feels mediocre now in comparison to HW and ShB
[3:29:48] <%VioletHeart> I feel like everyone has a good core kit now. They just need to tweak classes up and down a little to better suit.
[3:29:49] <BunnyEmperor> I feel it was wrong of them to remove Hakagure for SAM, even though they added instant kenki instead, it feels wrong
[3:29:49] <+Fynale> you can feel the MONEY
[3:29:52] <haveswordmuststing> @katabolicrage cant wait for the BLU update Kappa
[3:29:55] <DevinMayCry> Don't skip SB lol. SB was good.
[3:29:58] <%VioletHeart> Nobody needs a rework.
[3:30:02] <floatRand> ShB story > HW story so far at 76.
[3:30:08] <+DZiffer> What do you think about the new jobs, Mr. Pat?
[3:30:11] <floatRand> You are pranking him.
[3:30:17] <+valkuma> sch needs a rework
[3:30:20] <+valkuma> 100%
[3:30:22] <%TheSniperJoe> This expansion feels like it has more of Yoshi P's fingerprints on it...which I know is weird to say, but this feels more like the game he would have made if he hadn't been using someone's elses broken tools.
[3:30:23] <%Mekhet09> AST Need a revert.
[3:30:24] <SailingSaturn> Soken brought his SSS game cirSlain
[3:30:25] <ExpressNode> Throw dirt inside his house
[3:30:39] <graemecrackers1> Is Paige having a good day?
[3:30:52] <+Pyr0_Fr0st> In hindsight SB feels a little like a filler arc now
[3:31:00] <%Gogogolem> Dancer is great if you liked red mage. GunBreaker is probably the most complicated tank cause of its long rotation
[3:31:19] <%Lapinelis> The best bits of SB were not-Mongolia and post-story not-Mongolia
[3:31:19] <BunnyEmperor> Depending on how fast Pat is he might even get to the first trial on stream today
[3:31:29] <%Nikopol1717> @AngriestPat are you doing sidequests or just dungeon running to beat level walls?
[3:32:19] <SailorZoey> how bad are tank queues now that gunbreaker is in the game and dark knight is on the cover of ShB?
[3:32:19] <+Rolandknight> @AngriestPat Is MR. Clemps joining you today?
[3:32:23] <DevinMayCry> You guys are forgetting how much happened in SB.
[3:32:49] <haveswordmuststing> @sailorzoey that someone posted a screencap of DPS hero in need
[3:33:02] <%VioletHeart> So what's the biggest draw for Dark Knight to you, Pat? Was the HW version you presumably started with a lot of fun? Or is it just big sword?
[3:33:03] <%Mekhet09> That's only because ala mhigo made me want to forget.
[3:33:14] <%Lapinelis> The 73 dungoen is great
[3:33:29] <floatRand> In case you encounter an ascian, wink wink
[3:33:32] <floatRand> wink
[3:33:38] <%VioletHeart> @SailorZoey They're on par with DPS queues before the expansion.
[3:33:39] <metrying> what does it do?
[3:33:43] <haveswordmuststing> Unobtainium?
[3:33:53] <%Valdorick> Ah, a White Power Crystal. Solus would be proud.
[3:33:58] <Kisiel250> his ears are too low
[3:34:07] <%Lapinelis> @metrying stores aether
[3:34:10] <floatRand> Ascians are basically liches, but unlike liches, they were smarter and made everyone else their phylacteries
[3:34:11] <+VoidBastid> this NPC is unnecessarily sexy
[3:34:12] <KatabolicRage> tldr, the big bads are immortal bodyhoppers, white auracite can stop them just noping out after their body gets killed
[3:34:12] <SailorZoey> @VioletHeart oh noey
[3:34:18] <floatRand> So you put one in that and smash it hard
[3:34:21] <metrying> @Lapinelis ah thank you
[3:34:24] <%TheSniperJoe> Moenbryda was best girl.
[3:34:33] <DevinMayCry> Yeah you trap em like ghost busters then BLAST THE FUCK out of them
[3:34:34] <+valkuma> ascians are just dicks
[3:34:47] <$Yakobro> ascians are cool guys and solus is my husbando
[3:34:50] <hydragoon513> Everyone with the echo is a pain to kill
[3:34:56] <+valkuma> Peon
[3:34:58] <metrying> DansGame
[3:35:00] <alrobot2014> wat
[3:35:01] <+Artemis_Scowl> Yo why is thancred such a dick to this child?
[3:35:02] <+valkuma> cirPat
[3:35:02] <$shadow1man9> No, the counterpart to Sin Eaters would be Voidsent
[3:35:05] <%Valdorick> So wholesome!
[3:35:06] <DevinMayCry> Give her a tiny hat
[3:35:06] <+valkuma> cirPat cirPat cirPat cirPat cirPat cirPat cirPat cirPat cirPat cirPat cirPat
[3:35:07] <KatabolicRage> all girls crave the headpat
[3:35:13] <%sshen> I just got 1 mil exp from a fate with the fate bonus
[3:35:28] <%Roundelay11> Then how did he teleport us from the dragon guy?
[3:35:34] <$rekinom> GUN WIFE
[3:35:34] <+vizzay> Waifu ammo
[3:35:38] <floatRand> Have you seen GNB LB3 yet?
[3:35:39] <%Valdorick> HOW!? What about a sword with a revolver on it says "defensive weapon"!?
[3:35:41] <%Kirijuo> Wouldn't Dark Wardens be the equivalent of the really strong voidsent we've fought over the years
[3:35:44] <floatRand> It is real cool, bunch of pew pew pew
[3:35:44] <+valkuma> Thancred even looks like he belongs in FF8 now
[3:35:46] <haveswordmuststing> so where did this creepy head pat buissiness start other than Plague in this sphere
[3:35:47] <+EvilSoully> Crystal Exarch did it
[3:35:57] <+DZiffer> That's much better than turning her into an arm
[3:36:00] <count_bob> So wait. Is your body still back in the source?
[3:36:01] <%VioletHeart> @Valdorick You use ammunition to make shields. It *is* a tank class after all.
[3:36:03] <count_bob> Is that how this works?
[3:36:09] <DevinMayCry> The heros body isnt
[3:36:16] <DevinMayCry> Thats why they can teleport back
[3:36:21] <count_bob> Ahhh.
[3:36:25] <%Piemen99> !uptime
[3:36:25] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 36m.
[3:36:31] <%VioletHeart> Everyone else was a botched summon attempt.
[3:36:32] <+DZiffer> Minifilia
[3:36:33] <alrobot2014> Bigfilia?
[3:36:33] <%Valdorick> So, you're saying, the Dr Gatling of this world really did create a gun that reduced battlefield deaths?
[3:36:42] <%Piemen99> damn im kinda late
[3:37:06] <Overloard> (((echo)))
[3:37:06] <+VariantX7> these fukin' migrains

[3:37:33] <$CharlesRobinJr> she sounds different
[3:37:36] <%Valdorick> She is a lightborne Ascian!
[3:37:37] <DevinMayCry> All your friends are their souls basically.
[3:37:39] <SailingSaturn> @count_bob they aren't in their bodies except for the WoL
[3:37:40] <+DZiffer> always go back to the waking sands, the more the better
[3:37:41] <MoonObscure> YUP

[3:38:05] <+valkuma> Minfilia is a huge big evil
[3:38:06] <+DZiffer> Meanfilia
[3:38:11] <BunnyEmperor> Greater purpose
[3:38:13] <+Sgt_Wigglytuff> has she been doing it to kids who happen to look like her
[3:38:14] <+Lost_Zombie> Thancred all about possessing childrens
[3:38:15] <%Valdorick> Just copy Solus 4Head

[3:38:25] <mayorrev> MEMEfilia
[3:38:38] <%Kirijuo> Honestly unless it was someone we knew, we've never really cared that the ascians possessed people
[3:38:40] <%TheSniperJoe> Pray return to the Waking Sands, with more children for me to pilot to their death.

[3:39:17] <$Yakobro> she's saving their world man, she had to
[3:39:19] <+EvilSoully> Basically minfilia's saying she'll erase herself to let minifilia be her own person
[3:39:20] <+valkuma> Thancred wants that child body.
[3:39:24] <Kisiel250> MILFilia

[3:41:19] <AmericanaRed> Lmao
[3:41:22] <+DZiffer> But MINFILIA is YOU!
[3:41:27] <KatabolicRage> to be fair she's mostly throwing her power at these kids, rather than straight up bodyjacking them
[3:41:44] <Derkinstacker> Soul tansfer
[3:41:44] <BunnyEmperor> With secks
[3:41:46] <ClumzyDragon> baba is minfilia

[3:42:14] <ClumzyDragon> oks
[3:42:20] <%Lapinelis> Garlemald made a bunch of clones, take one of those
[3:42:24] <Derkinstacker> Hey is that the script?
[3:42:26] <devaitto> Chat anyone by any chance buyed the game from steam?
[3:42:28] <%Lapinelis> Have Solos-Minfilia
[3:42:36] <+DZiffer> they could make her a artificial body
[3:42:37] <%Lapinelis> @devaitto Me.
[3:42:51] <%Lapinelis> What issue do you have?
[3:42:56] <metrying> LUL
[3:43:00] <devaitto> My issue is that China Enix hate me.
[3:43:21] <%Lapinelis> I don't know how to deal with China Enix :p
[3:43:27] <$CharlesRobinJr> everything is not fine
[3:43:34] <redrins> can anybody else besides the garleans make artificial bodies?
[3:43:36] <SatsumaVO> It's the XIV lore book writted by Koji Fox. Now available on the Sqeenix storeee
[3:43:37] <devaitto> And they don't have regional prices for my country, so i pay more for a monthly sub than the game + expansion
[3:43:38] <+lucaflow> She was probably totally listening in on that entire conversation
[3:43:49] <MoonObscure> fairyland is the best
[3:43:53] <%Lapinelis> @redrins Allagan tech, so anyone with a shovel.
[3:43:55] <%heckyell> how come the pitch of the music is all wobbly?
[3:44:21] <redrins> good point
[3:44:30] <haveswordmuststing> @devaitto game cards may be price adjusted
[3:44:38] <devaitto> There's no game cards on my country
[3:44:39] <+ninebreaker6> the flashback was the echo
[3:44:40] <+lucaflow> I feel like they talk about it while you get a nifty cutscene cause you're more important
[3:44:45] <haveswordmuststing> that sucks man
[3:45:02] <DevinMayCry> Yoshi P made Eorzea Ivalice
[3:45:03] <devaitto> Yeah idk
[3:45:06] <$CharlesRobinJr> what ff game did he direct
[3:45:07] <metrying> everybody is having some sort of issue with the steam version, sucks
[3:45:09] <devaitto> I'm searching for a way to see if i can pay it cheaper.
[3:45:12] <%Lapinelis> How does this compares to Ala Mhigo, pat Kappa
[3:45:14] <devaitto> Legally obiously
[3:45:18] <CyborgAV> Yeah, The Crystarium is great because it's big ol' fantasy city
[3:45:21] <Thenuclearwalrus> CASH MONEY
[3:45:22] <MoonObscure> AY
[3:45:30] <+PurpleMoonMan> Elmo is best kitty
[3:45:33] <DevinMayCry> The crystarium is straight from 1.0 content though
[3:45:38] <%Valdorick> Total Garbage to that master piece Kappa
[3:45:40] <+lucaflow> lol Ala Mhigo
[3:45:43] <thwak> this expansion feels like a final fantasy elseworlds story
[3:45:54] <DevinMayCry> Yoshi didnt write the story too
[3:46:00] <%Kirijuo> Honestly dealing with Garlemald for so many years has gotten super stale
[3:46:02] <+PurpleMoonMan> The fungeon?
[3:46:05] <devaitto> Hope i can refund the game
[3:46:10] <TioXyco> @DevinMayCry doesn't it remind you of the very first trailer of FF14?]
[3:46:20] <DevinMayCry> Yeah. Very much
[3:46:26] <metrying> @devaitto the sooner you try the better
[3:46:30] <+Pyr0_Fr0st> @AngriestPat What we need are ALIENS!!
[3:46:38] <%Valdorick> Tits is your KING?
[3:46:41] <DevinMayCry> Who needs primals when you got apostles to kill
[3:46:51] <+Sgt_Wigglytuff> Titania is bae in SMT/Persona

[3:47:59] <count_bob> Yup @IFlaske
[3:48:12] <+Sum_White_Guy> "you're probably gonna die... but we wanna at least watch you die when it happens cause that sounds like fun!"

[3:49:46] <%Kirijuo> Kirijuo subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months! I can't believe how good the classes feel now, decided to switch to BLM this expansion and its been great with the new skills, I don't get how they fucked SCH so much when everything else is so great
[3:49:51] <%Guardiansaiyan> Steroids solve EVERYTHING
[3:49:57] <%Valdorick> Just get apatBig nerd
[3:49:57] <metrying> you have a sort of an LP with pat of re2 on woollies channel
[3:49:58] <alrobot2014> what does a super big pixie look like
[3:50:05] <+DZiffer> But a super strong pixie would be soo good
[3:50:13] <Sol_Install> oh so he's the biggest loser
[3:50:14] <GarbageQueenEllie> Freaking roided out pixie with giant buldging mucles
[3:50:22] <%heckyell> Become god damn huge as fuck
[3:50:37] <+Sum_White_Guy> pat doesn't know what he's done
[3:50:39] <BunnyEmperor> THAT is a good question
[3:50:41] <%weissguard> Become... GIANT
[3:50:46] <+Sum_White_Guy> he's sent a pixie on its HUGE QUEST
[3:50:56] <+Sum_White_Guy> they will become HUGE
[3:50:57] <%Valdorick> Ask Pixie what rings it got, bitch.
[3:50:58] <+sixcubit> pretty cheery mood for a place right next to a castle containing the burning light of destruction
[3:51:03] <zenith0111> Quick eat some pillz
[3:51:05] <floatRand> I mean... he's Urianger. He hang around in Waking Sands for 3 expansions
[3:51:10] <%heckyell> Pixie: Become Huge
[3:51:20] <floatRand> He has spot for inconveniencing you.
[3:51:27] <Overloard> water sprint PogChamp
[3:51:41] <+Unlimited_Rulebook> @AngriestPat PAT what's your early impression of this expansion compared to the last two
[3:51:46] <+Sum_White_Guy> rumour has it that pixie has become a cannibal now and is bunch pressing the castle
[3:51:54] <floatRand> Fae are fucked up.
[3:52:01] <%Roundelay11> Better than Stormblood?
[3:52:10] <floatRand> if there is anything fairy tales and D&D taught me, never deal with Fae
[3:52:12] <%frankthetank285> yay 10 monfs
[3:52:17] <+Unlimited_Rulebook> more gooder, more goobbue
[3:52:18] <zenith0111> Is this a good time to get FF14?
[3:52:19] <Overloard> was stormblood that bad?
[3:52:32] <+lucaflow> Stormblood is defintely the weakest expansion
[3:52:36] <jackythefrost> Stormblood wasnBAD. but it was very meh compared to Heavensward
[3:52:38] <floatRand> They did it in wrong ways
[3:52:45] <%Mekhet09> They also ruined AST.
[3:52:46] <%frankthetank285> frankthetank285 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months! YES
[3:52:50] <BunnyEmperor> They removed miasma LULW
[3:52:57] <+lucaflow> It needed to be knocked down a peg not thrown off a building
[3:53:00] <MoonObscure> my poor baby astro ;w;
[3:53:23] <BunnyEmperor> I also find that AST pre SHB was better
[3:53:26] <metrying> @zenith0111 you can play up to lv 35 for free if you wanna see if you like it
[3:53:37] <ScreenTerror> @AngriestPat whats the fastest effective way to experience the story if ive already skipped it to catch up with my friends? any reccomended youtube videos or anything?
[3:53:47] <haveswordmuststing> @lucaflow but with MCH getting reworked there needs to be SOME CLASS thats made shitty to play due to updates Kappa
[3:53:48] <floatRand> RIP AST, I miss thee. I mained SB with AST, and now swapped to Edgar-job
[3:53:50] <jackythefrost> Also Ala Mhigo was incredibly disappointing. Its a shanty town in the middle of nowhere
[3:53:59] <%Kirijuo> Sch didn't even get that huge of a nerf, they just made it boring
[3:54:19] <+valkuma> ^
[3:54:19] <+zaworldo> Is ffXIV worth getting if nobody I know plays it?
[3:54:22] <floatRand> SCH's healing kit is even stronger
[3:54:25] <BunnyEmperor> Out of the three healers AST is the most fucked rn
[3:54:27] <zenith0111> @metrying Hell yeah :D
[3:54:27] <%Kain5707> @haveswordmuststing go to an INN and watch re-watch them with your own character
[3:54:31] <+valkuma> its not that scholar was nerfed its that scholar was turned into a More-boring version of whitemage.
[3:54:34] <floatRand> But losing all those dps tools just made it real bore to play.
[3:54:42] <+vizzay> Scholar might be trash but at least we can use Selene
[3:54:46] <floatRand> And AST lost all texture frankly.
[3:54:49] <mayorrev> ELMO
[3:54:51] <$Yakobro> :D
[3:55:06] <jackythefrost> @zaworldo I got into XIV without knowing anyone who played it, its currently my favorite game
[3:55:14] <haveswordmuststing> @screenterror go to the Inn, like @kain5707 said
[3:55:16] <zenith0111> All the Regalias
[3:55:26] <+zaworldo> the expansions cost money right? or no
[3:55:39] <Overloard> that car mount is so bad LUL
[3:55:54] <jackythefrost> Yes but you just need to buy the latest expansion as it comes with all the previous ones
[3:55:56] <$Yakobro> wow
[3:56:01] <+zaworldo> Got it
[3:56:06] <%aishman> aishman subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 12 months! One full year of giving money to the Goblin Mind King! Keep up the amazing content as always and honk the baby.
[3:56:07] <haveswordmuststing> @zaworldo the base game and the newest expansion are the only 2 initial purchases needed, 13-15 buck sub a month though
[3:56:09] <%Frostiesaurusrex> Frostiesaurusrex subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months, currently on a 6 month streak! 
[3:56:31] <metrying> so pretty :D
[3:56:54] <%Frostiesaurusrex> Papa pat noticed me
[3:56:56] <jackythefrost> I think pat might be close to the level 73 dungeon
[3:57:11] <zenith0111> How good is the controller support?
[3:57:12] <BunnyEmperor> He is
[3:57:16] <Stari> This is the dungeon
[3:57:17] <%chimaera24> @AngriestPat Is Clemps gonna be joining you again?
[3:57:38] <jackythefrost> @zenith0111 Its great, many people perfer controller over keyboard in this game
[3:57:44] <metrying> @zenith0111 pat has a vod where he goes in depth about it, it seems great
[3:58:02] <zenith0111> @jackythefrost Interesting

[3:59:50] <metrying> oh wait im stupid
[3:59:50] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 4 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 16oz (480mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[3:59:50] <BunnyEmperor> Yeah take minfilia with you, she is so dumb in this dungeon
[3:59:52] <metrying> nvm

[4:00:52] <+zaworldo> FOr twitch prime
[4:00:52] <%Shady_Squid> Do you feel like things have been simplified for DK? As a monk they got rid of my off GCD attacks.
[4:00:53] <BunnyEmperor> The final boss has a dope mechanic
[4:00:55] <@Velyndra> "hes a healer" lol
[4:00:58] <Overloard> this is straight up a KH Level
[4:01:00] <%Ninestempest> even for shit like trials and 50/60/70 rou

[4:01:07] <KatabolicRage> he taxi'd YOU in
[4:01:08] <floatRand> Best boss of Stormblood, even.
[4:01:16] <shnorkk> Funnily enough, I've done about 4 queues and haven't seen a single dancer so far.
[4:01:18] <floatRand> (outside of ultimates, but ymmv)
[4:01:24] <MoonObscure> you're lame
[4:01:28] <SailingSaturn> Healers are the ones in demand cirISee
[4:01:29] <%Ninestempest> I dont see dancers in current content yet lol

[4:02:38] <Stari> Just do what you want
[4:02:44] <%Suchawus> Dance the Night Away
[4:03:39] <%weissguard> So there's a recurring theme that I've seen so far with this expansion. It's that the music is GREAT. Kreygasm
[4:03:45] <%weissguard> **noticed
[4:04:01] <%weissguard> Purrrrrrrty. PogChamp
[4:04:01] <+valkuma> faerie music is always good
[4:04:02] <KatabolicRage> a lot of melancholy otherworldly tones in shadowbringers, and I am a SUCKER for that shit
[4:04:05] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> ffxiv's music in general is really good
[4:04:10] <+DZiffer> The song sounds slightly like the nutcracker suite
[4:04:14] <robo_badger> Can't wait for July 2nd so I can finally play this game
[4:04:18] <+valkuma> hes in faerie world
[4:04:48] <floatRand> Yeah, he's SSSing it this expansion
[4:04:52] <floatRand> Can't wait for raidstuff
[4:04:52] <%Faustgesicht> Soken doin' work
[4:04:57] <floatRand> Since it is not just remixing old tunes.
[4:05:02] <floatRand> ...Or maybe it is FF8 stuff
[4:05:11] <%weissguard> MAX Acting the musical expectations.
[4:06:23] <+zaworldo> we F A L L

[4:06:46] <%cherubs_anonymous> After having watched Pat play this for so long I can safely say I cannot comprehend why anyone likes this
[4:06:52] <AzureHawk_Streams> THAT'S AN AAAAALIEN
[4:07:06] <BunnyEmperor> This one fucks with first timers really hard
[4:07:27] <BunnyEmperor> You DONT stand on the water fields
[4:07:44] <SailingSaturn> sure you do cirDerp
[4:07:48] <+Raidou24> Don't stand in geysers about to go off
[4:07:49] <%weissguard> I feel like Aenc is about to break out into song.
[4:07:57] <SailingSaturn> you go really far too aeroDerp
[4:08:10] <+Raidou24> Stand in place of geyser that just recently went off

[4:09:16] <Stari> @sailingsaturn she’s the best!
[4:09:42] <floatRand> There is very specific feel for the dungeon theme here - the sort of old tapes containing tellings of fairy-tales or other tales (such as treasure island) that I used to listen to as kid. They used very similar music in those.
[4:09:47] <SailingSaturn> LUL
[4:09:49] <BunnyEmperor> lmao
[4:10:01] <%Suchawus> wheres the pattern
[4:10:08] <thwak> rip that dragoon
[4:10:09] <+Raidou24> Don't stand in geysers about to go off
[4:10:12] <+Raidou24> Stand in place of geyser that just recently went off
[4:10:16] <SailingSaturn> the pattern is keep moving LUL

[4:10:35] <SailingSaturn> its pain for me the mobile turrent- BLM cirSlain
[4:10:58] <metrying> wait thats the black forrest no?
[4:11:02] <Thenuclearwalrus> @SilvaChariot0133 BLM has been having it bad with bosses so far this expansion LUL
[4:11:07] <Stari> @metrying no
[4:11:17] <+TheImmortal70> Oh you make them explode
[4:11:26] <Jolnir> my dad could beat up your dad
[4:11:33] <%Mekhet09> Christ why do dark knights take so much damage.
[4:11:53] <%logoth_> BBEEEESSS
[4:11:54] <KatabolicRage> have some BEES pat
[4:12:00] <ClumzyDragon> bUrself
[4:12:02] <$valriot> DROPPED MY BEEEEES
[4:12:02] <BunnyEmperor> At least they use unfinal sting and not final sting LUL
[4:12:11] <Thenuclearwalrus> @Mekhet09 Everything does a ton of damage in dungeons in ShB it seems
[4:12:36] <%HRDSalami654> Not the BEEEEEESS!
[4:12:57] <Thenuclearwalrus> ~Magic~
[4:13:10] <%logoth_> those mushrooms are from ff11
[4:13:12] <%doc_ock_rokc> Whats that? I fight Woefuly understaffed by Bees? My suitcase full of bees should fix that
[4:13:13] <%Ninestempest> yeah the leveling dungeons are a LITTLE harder
[4:13:25] <BunnyEmperor> Next boss fight Pat is gonna go VERY BIG
[4:13:26] <%klholland92> Its magic water
[4:13:37] <Thenuclearwalrus> Because it was insanely good
[4:13:38] <+DZiffer> The magic of imagination~
[4:13:46] <floatRand> Probably because also other AoEs
[4:13:58] <$valriot> @angriestpat It's more inline with the other Tank AOE DoTs
[4:14:00] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> you got a buffed free aoe combo in its place
[4:14:00] <floatRand> MCH AoE becomes amazing at 72 when you get the fart-gas blaster
[4:14:16] <+Masutasodo> my BIO BLASTU
[4:14:27] <+Sgt_Wigglytuff> I guess stalwart soul was the trade off which I'll take
[4:15:17] <+DZiffer> I wonder if all these magical happy fairy tale creatures expected to get beat up today
[4:15:36] <BunnyEmperor> Its BIG
[4:15:37] <%yeknomlive> it's a pokemon
[4:15:38] <$valriot> POKEMON
[4:15:39] <BlueLunecy> THat's just a pokemon

[4:19:06] <+Unlimited_Rulebook> some people dont wanna get huge
[4:19:09] <+RocketBarrel> Is this Titania's dungeon?
[4:19:20] <%Mekhet09> I repeat that in the stupidest way and people still don't get it.
[4:19:23] <+VariantX7> that could have been their fetish so they didn't block it
[4:19:24] <Stari> @rocketbarrel Titania is a trial
[4:19:29] <corrosivePaladin> no its fine just kill it through the buff taterHahaa
[4:19:29] <%Mekhet09> Titania isn't a dungeon.
[4:19:53] <%Kain5707> her ex trail is going to be insane
[4:20:06] <bxdragon> Made it this far in the game and still doing noob mistakes Kappa
[4:20:18] <tmo200> Oh ya, i forgot whm doesn't have protect anymore
[4:20:21] <AzureHawk_Streams> Is that a Lightning costume?
[4:20:24] <+VariantX7> block it
[4:20:30] <BunnyEmperor> The boss should always only have 1 tether
[4:20:35] <%Valdorick> DPS check
[4:20:35] <%Kain5707> he always gets 1
[4:20:42] <%Tacgnol66> Can you kill the sprouts that shoot the beam?
[4:20:51] <%Valdorick> Well, no, not even that - just a "don't suck at blocking 4" check
[4:20:53] <%heckyell> playable burmecians when
[4:20:53] <DevinMayCry> You grow big too though. So as long as everyone gets a beam its equal
[4:20:54] <Calek> can't target sprout
[4:20:59] <corrosivePaladin> So its a wipe mechanic and a dps race
[4:21:04] <BunnyEmperor> Yeah basically mini dps check, but you get stronger if you do it right
[4:21:07] <%Valdorick> Playable fucking Burmecians WHEN!?
[4:21:15] <%extrwi> one assize *destroys* that
[4:21:35] <Sol_Install> that a mean wolf tree thing
[4:21:37] <%Kain5707> i thought assize was heal only now?
[4:21:43] <DevinMayCry> Nope.
[4:21:53] <%Kain5707> oh good
[4:21:55] <Calek> it still does damage
[4:21:57] <DevinMayCry> That was fake leaks rumoring that
[4:22:09] <%Lapinelis> The lvl 72 skill for BLM is so good
[4:22:09] <bxdragon> It better this is the DRK expansion
[4:22:18] <%Valdorick> Xeno whatever it is?
[4:22:18] <DevinMayCry> Im almost to GL4
[4:22:21] <DevinMayCry> I can taste it
[4:22:28] <Jolnir> im black
[4:22:30] <KUYAmoPESh> Ever wonder if MH just became a very-very-verrryyyyy good MMO like FFXIV?
[4:22:45] <%Dwarven_Gaming> mnk GL4 is SWEET
[4:22:53] <DevinMayCry> Its mostly the same. The biggest change is literally the replacement for One Ilm Punch which a lot of the time is just used in AOE rotation
[4:22:55] <Calek> there is a Monster Hunter MMO it's called Phantasy Star Online
[4:22:57] <%Dwarven_Gaming> I just got it and i feel so FAST
[4:22:57] <%Bigdrifter210> whats gl4?
[4:23:08] <%Dwarven_Gaming> grease lighting four
[4:23:10] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> why is your drg doing aoes
[4:23:11] <+Lost_Zombie> There was a Monster Hunter MMO it wasn't bad tbh
[4:23:11] <%Kain5707> relic gear is in first launch right?
[4:23:13] <DevinMayCry> But it also refreshes your Twin Viper buff so its best use on 2 or more
[4:23:17] <+Estuko> @Calek I hear it's closing :(
[4:23:19] <KUYAmoPESh> @Calek Oh silly you hihi
[4:23:21] <%og_lunchbox> So, on DRK your MP is just for Edge of Shadow and TBN basically? Or am i missing something?
[4:23:27] <metrying> gg :D
[4:23:28] <%ovan20> @AngriestPat try the summoner sometime, it also got some love and plays way different now.
[4:23:29] <AzureHawk_Streams> Is that player wearing a Lightning costume?
[4:23:32] <+TheImmortal70> Pretty much
[4:23:33] <etbarni> healing pants!
[4:23:36] <%Dwarven_Gaming> its fist of fire until 3, then switch to fist of wind
[4:23:38] <+TheImmortal70> Your MP decides how much you can burst
[4:23:40] <%weissguard> PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[4:23:41] <DevinMayCry> I think Monk will be nerfed later. I think GL4 will do a lot more damage then people think.
[4:23:42] <bxdragon> Nice
[4:23:43] <+Sgt_Wigglytuff> Urianger could have come lol
[4:23:47] <Overloard> thats a big FFX
[4:23:56] <Pixel_Butts> MAN i REALLY wanna watch this but SPOILERS
[4:24:03] <+Estuko> COOL LIGHTNING PogChamp
[4:24:03] <%weissguard> LUL
[4:24:05] <%Fatmanjoggin> The cooler lightning
[4:24:06] <+justianxix> COOLER Lightning
[4:24:07] <%terminallyCapriciousz> hahaha COOL LIGHTNING
[4:24:08] <BunnyEmperor> LULW beach shades
[4:24:08] <+Estuko> I bet she can skateboard
[4:24:10] <%Guardiansaiyan> grease ligtning?
[4:24:13] <AzureHawk_Streams> MingLee MingLee LUL LUL
[4:24:16] <%Suchawus> Cool Lightning Doritos
[4:24:22] <metrying> how many hours does the new expansion last roughly?
[4:24:27] <%Kain5707> Jebaited
[4:24:28] <DevinMayCry> Yeah. Grease Lightning makes you attack faster. And Monks now get to go to a level beyond
[4:24:31] <neveton> Radical lightning!!
[4:24:32] <%ovan20> i don't care about spoilers, i'm in heavensward, so i have no context for them LUL
[4:24:34] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat The last boss of this dungeon is the best.
[4:24:36] <DevinMayCry> The devs were afraid of speeding Monk more
[4:24:40] <%Lapinelis> More than 24.
[4:24:46] <floatRand> 2 years about
[4:24:48] <Katorskay> a lot
[4:24:50] <Katorskay> more than 0
[4:24:51] <%Kain5707> depends how you do it
[4:24:53] <+Sgt_Wigglytuff> as long as you want
[4:24:56] <%kiiiirsten> I just got home from work now I can watch Pat play this game I know nothing about!!!
[4:25:02] <+DZiffer> Oh wow, that watery voice that said you could just have it totally lied, who would've thought?!
[4:25:02] <%terminallyCapriciousz> more than 0, less than infinity
[4:25:05] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> that drg you're running with is really bad
[4:25:09] <%Dwarven_Gaming> well i think its good
[4:25:10] <%thepeoplezoo> Parasite Eve (the best Final Fantasy) content in XIV when?
[4:25:13] <DevinMayCry> If you want to know if you have time to get in and enjoy ut The anwser is yes. A long long time
[4:25:16] <%Dwarven_Gaming> gl4 makes monk feel better
[4:25:20] <DevinMayCry> I bet it does
[4:25:22] <Calek> when is Lavos going to be a raid boss
[4:25:26] <+BlackJack607> How much time do you think it would take to blast through SB from beginning to end?
[4:25:26] <%ovan20> @kiiiirsten play the game you silly, you can play for free up to lvl 35
[4:25:27] <%Dwarven_Gaming> tbh if they were worried about speeding up classes...look at mch lol
[4:25:27] <Overloard> waterhorse PogChamp
[4:25:32] <+VariantX7> you can't quantify how long this expansion lasts because there are going to be more updates for the next year or so for it
[4:25:40] <+VariantX7> that add more story
[4:25:42] <Calek> I really like this next boss
[4:25:45] <metrying> im really new to mmos sorry
[4:25:49] <KUYAmoPESh> I wish SMT online was still a thing.
[4:25:53] <DevinMayCry> Main story wise Pat is less then half most likely
[4:25:53] <Sol_Install> ah the kelpie... the thing that drags people underwater and tear them apart while eating them
[4:25:58] <%doc_ock_rokc> Its some sort of Weird 4 legged water chocobo
[4:25:58] <%kiiiirsten> @ovan20 how dare you enable MMO addiction! I am a recovering WoW player!
[4:26:01] <Sol_Install> so majestic
[4:26:01] <+DZiffer> Kelpie are scary, when you touch them you can't let go and then they dive deep unterwater to slowly drown you
[4:26:10] <%Lapinelis> Less than that
[4:26:11] <DevinMayCry> Huh fitting
[4:26:17] <DevinMayCry> Didnt know that kelpie lore
[4:26:17] <tmo200> Shouldnt that dragoon move around the monster more?
[4:26:24] <captainpodock> Music sounds like Fable
[4:26:26] <DevinMayCry> Fuck monsters that drown you. Fuck Kappas
[4:26:31] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> the drg is very bad
[4:26:34] <%weissguard> Kappa
[4:26:36] <%ovan20> @kiiiirsten the best way to recover from an adicttion, is to get another Kappa (not really, but play it) :P
[4:26:37] <+TheImmortal70> Is that drg not doing positionals
[4:26:41] <DevinMayCry> Always keep a cucumber handy
[4:26:44] <+VariantX7> lol the kelpies in the ducktalkes reboot were straight up trying the kill them the whole episode
[4:26:45] <+TheImmortal70> The thing that's an ACTIVE requirement for a new move
[4:26:50] <+VariantX7> ducktales*
[4:26:55] <%doc_ock_rokc> Fae mythology has a lot of water creatures
[4:27:06] <DevinMayCry> The river people huh
[4:27:16] <%og_lunchbox> God Dragoon feels so much goddamn better
[4:27:22] <+killer_squid1990> Yea, kelpies are murderous fae so the ducktales episode was true to the source
[4:27:42] <DevinMayCry> Nourish those lilies
[4:27:58] <troytaco> lol whm isnt using holy
[4:28:32] <icosahedralAPOI> Is dark knight a tanking class?

[4:28:43] <%Kain5707> well
[4:28:47] <DevinMayCry> All tanks are just fancy DPS now though
[4:28:55] <%Kain5707> all tanks are pretty much light dps at this point

[4:40:16] <alrobot2014> the first is all sorts of fucked it seems
[4:40:17] <Thenuclearwalrus> This is why you dont buy story skip potions as a new player, you would have no idea why you are able to breathe under water
[4:40:36] <stormingryocan220> Don't worry, Pat has Main character syndrome!
[4:40:41] <gerdzim3> magic :)
[4:40:42] <DevinMayCry> Yeah guys. You miss a lot of plot in the story skip lol
[4:40:47] <%VantomPayne> turtle magic
[4:40:49] <floatRand> It involves oriental turtles that are not teens
[4:40:54] <PunkZedB> Pat comes for insmouth, and as a result can breath underwater
[4:40:59] <+SlowLikeThunder> Only Alisae and Lyse, yeah?
[4:41:03] <Thenuclearwalrus> Some ARE ninjas though @floatRand
[4:41:06] <+Fynale> only alisae and lyse

[4:42:36] <DevinMayCry> The shield wasnt even about THAT SCENE. Thats how triggered pat is by it.
[4:42:46] <+Masutasodo> I remember it like it was yesterday stripSad
[4:42:47] <%VantomPayne> @AngriestPat i still havent leveled PLD but that shield is my only shield glamour in the armory chest
[4:42:49] <+SlowLikeThunder> I think the implication is that before the flood of light Voebrandt or whatever was basically ishgard
[4:42:59] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@VirtuallyCanadian) (warning)
[4:43:04] <deadredeyez> downpour is lit long livr boogie man
[4:43:10] <+SlowLikeThunder> since WoDmen talks about it freezing over in the winter and you get Ishgard flashbacks
[4:43:26] <DevinMayCry> I am a huge fan of amazing beautiful landscapes that are built over the ruins of mankind. Shits awesome. Like the end of Daikon IV
[4:43:42] <+Fynale> soroban is a bro

[4:45:10] <%Dwarven_Gaming> OMG
[4:45:20] <%Dwarven_Gaming> its literatrely ewoks vs empire

[4:46:38] <+valkuma> PAT LOVES PAIGE LUL
[4:46:42] <katocrimson> mukbang
[4:46:43] <Reckless_Rob> Always when I check in Pats stream, he leaves
[4:46:45] <+valkuma> COOTIES
[4:47:06] <Reckless_Rob> Is PeePee also Elmo?
[4:47:07] <+Artemis_Scowl> @DevinMayCry god I hope so. i'm still in 2.2, and i apparently still have 70+ quest to get through.
[4:47:42] <%Faustgesicht> @DevinMayCry I'm doing it. occasionly MSQ to break the monotony. Might be a dancer before HW
[4:47:53] <Reckless_Rob> Screw you guys, Im going home
[4:48:00] <DevinMayCry> @Faustgesicht @Artemis_Scowl Yeah the time they get to HW you will see a DRASTIC change in how the game is paced. Not just quest wise but how the story is told and unfolds
[4:48:25] <floatRand> Bah, I am hitting another level gate
[4:48:48] <DevinMayCry> Its literally 100 quests between 2.0 and 3.0
[4:48:59] <+Artemis_Scowl> Why
[4:49:08] <DevinMayCry> Its the Naruto filler arc almost. Despite some big events
[4:49:25] <DevinMayCry> They didnt know how to structure post launch content updates as well
[4:49:42] <DevinMayCry> So they filled it with tedious fetch quests too much as what can only be called filler
[4:50:01] <DevinMayCry> It wasn't so bad when you were playing it as they came out
[4:50:15] <DevinMayCry> Because you had multiple months to do it
[4:50:25] <ClumzyDragon> pat is back
[4:50:32] <+lucaflow> no
[4:50:35] <+Artemis_Scowl> that makes a lot of sense
[4:50:37] <%mastertwin2> apatGoblin apatGoblin
[4:50:37] <ExpressNode> I miss my tea I just drank
[4:50:40] <ClumzyDragon> wb nerds
[4:50:49] <%sshen> weird talk is the shoutchat in this zone
[4:50:50] <DevinMayCry> I bet they do
[4:51:13] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> i have shout and yell turned off lol
[4:51:15] <+Artemis_Scowl> but as someone catching up, this is so jarring and monotonous.
[4:51:49] <DevinMayCry> Yeah. It sucks. Once your lumps are done you can enjoy it more though. if you enjoyed the story at all tot his point I promise you will really like it by HW launch
[4:51:58] <DevinMayCry> See. Pat knows.
[4:52:04] <DevinMayCry> Its worth it.
[4:52:05] <+Artemis_Scowl> @AngriestPat Yup
[4:52:10] <SailingSaturn> @Artemis_Scowl try to not to burn yourself out, its a long slog. But I treated it as comfy job cirComfy
[4:52:17] <+lucaflow> yeah ARR is bad with that
[4:52:18] <%Faustgesicht> 2.2 specifically
[4:52:20] <SailingSaturn> jog*
[4:52:27] <floatRand> Moogle Mog
[4:52:38] <SailingSaturn> @AngriestPat and that lore came back too cirISee
[4:52:46] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> they also wanted to bring in the primals cut out of 1.0 I think
[4:52:50] <+lucaflow> Wern't you forced to do Guildheists in one of them lol
[4:52:50] <Futurecity10> I just beat garuda and learned I'm no where near dark knight. I fucking hate ARR
[4:52:50] <%AChungusAmongUs> LUL
[4:52:52] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> like Titan and Leviathan
[4:53:01] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> because of the tsunami
[4:53:05] <+Artemis_Scowl> Its at least nice to get to know the characters better
[4:53:05] <DevinMayCry> Yeah Leviathan was canned after the tsunami caused byt he earthquake that canned Titan
[4:53:08] <Futurecity10> Dark knight should be a god damn starting class
[4:53:21] <floatRand> Pray return to the waking sands
[4:53:24] <jackythefrost> @Futurecity10 You only get DRK once you reach Ishgard
[4:53:25] <DevinMayCry> Leviathin is one of my favorite primals still
[4:53:28] <SailingSaturn> @Futurecity10 you'll get rdm and sam before drk cirISee
[4:53:51] <floatRand> I got chuckle out of fate "Pray destroy the waking sands"
[4:53:53] <Futurecity10> I have no idea what those are Sailing
[4:53:54] <%PinkSuprende> Ey Pat have you been told that the scrolls of mount speed are on the gem vendors
[4:54:01] <DevinMayCry> You can still and probably always will only be able to start as 1 healer in this game
[4:54:10] <Futurecity10> I'm tired of being a lancer and want my big sword already
[4:54:17] <$psydaku> hey @AngriestPat what i miss?
[4:54:27] <floatRand> They are locked behind some fates
[4:54:32] <floatRand> Afaik anyway
[4:54:42] <+lucaflow> I feel like 2.5 and 2.55 were the best part of ARR
[4:54:50] <jackythefrost> They are
[4:54:52] <DevinMayCry> yeah they are pretty hype
[4:54:53] <VirtuallyCanadian> maybe they can cure casca
[4:54:59] <+Artemis_Scowl> I started out as a Bard and now i'm a SAM and it does feel amazing to just tear through enemies now
[4:55:00] <%madhattergay> whats the best support class?
[4:55:07] <DevinMayCry> Lol Dancer I guess
[4:55:14] <jackythefrost> Dancer is now
[4:55:19] <jackythefrost> Used to be Bard
[4:55:22] <DevinMayCry> Support isnt a role offficially though

[5:03:27] <+Zxtole> @doc_ock_rokc Depends if chemistry was involved, or something simple such as a fungus or a toxin.
[5:03:28] <%Valdorick> Shit your ass and job change to Blue Mage!
[5:03:37] <xeros720> it's faster in a group and well balanced for duo play

[5:05:07] <+Estuko> I still love that photo of pat hiding in the closet and chomping on some sweets
[5:05:12] <SailingSaturn> That Lead Paige, its tastes sweet cirISee
[5:05:33] <xeros720> elmo learned everything from paige
[5:05:34] <$rekinom> What's the lore behind pat hiding candy?
[5:05:44] <ExpressNode> Pat's house is a metriodvania with wall candy
[5:06:01] <Thenuclearwalrus> F E T C H
[5:06:03] <CrypticMochi> Using candy as an excuse to eat wallpaper
[5:06:03] <%AChungusAmongUs> candy_closet.jpeg
[5:06:22] <%AChungusAmongUs> didn't know that would link
[5:06:25] <robo_badger> "Aid"
[5:06:29] <KatabolicRage> pixies dont' suck your dick, they just imply it and then turn you into a tree
[5:06:35] <$rekinom> onlyafroGasm
[5:06:42] <+StrawberryPantsu> Stop trying to make Fetch a thing its not gunna happen
[5:06:43] <ExpressNode> I wounding why I hear all this slurping
[5:06:43] <xeros720> he enjoys a candy every now and again, but he was embarrassed about it, so he'd hide the candy or only eat it secretly
[5:06:45] <+Bael_Lord_of_End> gachiBASS
[5:06:48] <+Estuko> I thought you were going to say "to serve us as slaves" and I was going to say hell yeah I'm built for that
[5:06:53] <Onillius> @AngriestPat you love it tho
[5:06:55] <%terminallyCapriciousz> paige is fucking HIGH
[5:06:55] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat Pat you were talking about a pixie giving ... i guess it would be a fullbody job.
[5:07:04] <floatRand> You can find more Nu Mou on e621
[5:07:07] <SatsumaVO> @AngriestPat They are the Nu Mous of Whoville
[5:07:12] <$rekinom> GOOD suc
[5:07:13] <xeros720> which of course meant pat ate candy in a dark closet
[5:07:14] <floatRand> (please don't take this seriously and don't go there)
[5:07:25] <xeros720> and paige got a picture of it
[5:07:26] <robo_badger> I need more Ivalice in my life
[5:07:36] <%ryome> It’s like the feet of the ears
[5:07:54] <$Afterman_> i really like this place
[5:07:55] <floatRand> I just dislike that they have only one model.
[5:07:58] <$rekinom> @floatRand e621 you say? ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
[5:08:00] <floatRand> Then again, Namazu only had one
[5:08:05] <+killer_squid1990> I think the Nu Mou are this expansion's crafting beast tribe
[5:08:18] <+justianxix> these guys basically smirfs?
[5:08:19] <bxdragon> I did'n't think Nu Mous would be that small.
[5:08:21] <xeros720> hooray for crafting tribes
[5:08:53] <+Jonesman64> i would think the dwarfs would be the crafty tribe
[5:09:07] <xeros720> are aetherflows easier? they mentioned something about that in the live letter
[5:09:15] <$rekinom> Here's the candy closet tweet: ***

[5:34:43] <Thenuclearwalrus> @ovan20 Yeah they add gear thats 5 levels below the endgame gear to vendors when a new expac launches so you can jump right in without worry
[5:34:49] <KatabolicRage> and thancreds really fuckin bad at hiding his awkwardness around a clone of his daugherfu
[5:34:53] <Thenuclearwalrus> @ovan20 The gearing process in a current expac is much slower

[5:36:30] <%ovan20> @eldritch_cpa it's genually a good game, but it's a MMO, so you have to play with other people to go through some of the content, at least
[5:36:36] <%rdark_ksu> I am so fuckin lost man
[5:36:36] <Thenuclearwalrus> That freaked me the fuck out when I was playing at 2 am

[5:42:11] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 5h 42m.
[5:42:17] <%Mekhet09> One of them had both an aether quest and a normal one.
[5:42:18] <%ovan20> @AdmiralButtloaf aethercurrents are always blue
[5:42:20] <SailingSaturn> I thought the same a couple of times so don't feel bad LUL
[5:42:26] <%PinkSuprende> Pat as far as I know every Aethercurrent are the first of a chain, not the ends of chains, so you're safe lookin' for blue markers
[5:42:27] <AdmiralButtloaf> i thought i remember him having both at the same time
[5:42:37] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> if you need two more, then its not here and the last one is titania
[5:42:49] <+d00msdaydan> every time that halo 2 hunter sound effect plays it triggers me

[5:43:19] <Sol_Install> @AdmiralButtloaf you must have been affected by the Paige
[5:43:30] <%Mekhet09> Because I remember that aether quests are locked by MSQ progression.
[5:43:35] <AdmiralButtloaf> hi
[5:43:45] <BunnyEmperor> @AdmiralButtloaf monkaW
[5:43:59] <%ovan20> @redrins why didn't you pre-order it?

[5:46:34] <%ovan20> @redrins If you have the pre-order bonus earrings, that buff your xp by 30% up to lvl 70, you should have access to ShB right now.
[5:46:35] <%Mekhet09> ONly way to get good xp would be to do the main story duty.
[5:46:39] <+EvilSoully> Daily Reminder that Tataru fucked every guy in Kugane

[5:57:03] <%QuadraticGravity> The presence of shredded lettuce and mayonnaise
[5:57:05] <+Double_Tap_That> Coleslaw has like mayo or something
[5:57:16] <%THATGUY_789> one is built with distance
[5:57:25] <Nordguy> you can tell by the way it is
[5:57:27] <AdmiralButtloaf> cabbage and mayo
[5:57:28] <Nina96> its a mix of things
[5:57:32] <%THATGUY_789> distaste
[5:57:37] <%madhattergay> coleslaw dressing is basically mayo and sugar
[5:57:43] <segychan> Cole slaw is specifically sheredded or julienned cabbage/veggies in a mayo based sauce
[5:57:43] <Cheeky_Cheekers> coleslaw is cabbage
[5:57:45] <$valriot> It's just raw carrot, cabbage, radish n just trash
[5:57:48] <segychan> salad is much wider of a definition
[5:57:48] <Nina96> bad
[5:57:50] <%THATGUY_789> it's fine when you don't know
[5:57:51] <%crimsonharvest> Gamer Slaw consists of shredded red vines, candy corn, and a light glaze

[5:59:51] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 6 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 24oz (720mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[5:59:52] <Calek> I had a 1/100 of that at one point
[5:59:53] <%THATGUY_789> does Montreal use poles and wires or is it under ground wiring
[5:59:54] <artoflec> so i dont know shit about XIV, how many dungeons does an expansion usually have? if there even is an average

[6:00:58] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat How long till they nerf tanking enimty is way to easy to hold.
[6:00:59] <%madhattergay> lol everytime you lean forward to take a bite your camera autofocuses and freaks out a bit
[6:01:05] <BunnyEmperor> You get to the unrevealed zones by doing MSQ
[6:01:07] <Laycas49> @AngriestPat do you have any dead online games you still like? I still indulge on For Honor

[6:02:40] <artoflec> Is there some other Final Fantasy class representation you'd like to see in XIV that isn't in yet? artofl1Hm
[6:02:42] <%QuadraticGravity> General tip for chat, if you're doing shadowbringers, remember your daily roulettes. That shit will carry your exp during the MSQ.
[6:02:46] <%ovan20> SCH lost a lot of attack skills and seems to have got nothing in return.
[6:02:47] <%kurihara> kurihara subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months, currently on a 7 month streak! the new zones in this xpac are the best they have ever been, hope youre doing well and enjoying shb as much as i am

[6:03:18] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 6h 3m.
[6:03:21] <BunnyEmperor> I dont mind Pat eating on stream, in fact he could do food reviews and I'd watch it LUL
[6:03:26] <+Double_Tap_That> I mean, Social Eating is a Twtich category
[6:03:26] <viciousgrim> no food is for the weak LUL
[6:03:28] <artoflec> Pat's been eating for SIX hours
[6:03:28] <$valriot> RDM seems, fine. Still pretty weak dps wise

[6:13:36] <%ovan20> @THATGUY_789 you can't customize it to make it look like Elmo, this game doesn't have the cat creator of monster hunter :P
[6:13:37] <%THATGUY_789> one thing that I found I really like Hrofgarr despite the hung is the adorable grin smile they do
[6:13:59] <%THATGUY_789> hunch
[6:14:14] <%THATGUY_789> big kitty grin
[6:14:35] <%madhattergay> man i really hope i dont have to go to the hospital for this back pain

[6:15:16] <+Zxtole> I'd go to the doctor at the slightest hint of problems with my back. Don't fuck with back injury
[6:15:37] <%VioletHeart> Were those enemies called "Forgiven Cowardice"? Is that what Pat would become if he turned into a sin eater?

[6:49:49] <%Mekhet09> Yeah it's all on the DPS to lb3 right.
[6:49:57] <+TheImmortal70> The only part that will get you is that adds need to be split amongst tanks, and you have to pay a lot of attention

[6:55:48] <+ozmodek> @angriestpat they auto the full map
[6:55:51] <BunnyEmperor> Thats why you have to help tanking Pat...
[6:55:51] <Menarii> Shield samba
[6:55:53] <%QuadraticGravity> If you don't get aggro from the big boys they fucking tank bust
[6:55:53] <Cpt_phantom> Healers taking busters to the face
[6:55:55] <%psychocalibur> grab aggro on the other two
[6:55:59] <%BlueMoonBlues> gotta turn ur tank stance on at smome point
[6:56:00] <+ozmodek> you gotta take aggro on all of them.
[6:56:02] <Nina96> F
[6:56:02] <+Kashishh> Holy shit why is this song so good
[6:56:11] <+YoungGroose> wut
[6:56:13] <iwasJase> yeah, someone's going to need to grab aggro the others
[6:56:13] <BunnyEmperor> No you didnt keep aggro
[6:56:14] <floatRand> It's Dancing Plague
[6:56:14] <Stari> SourPls
[6:56:18] <+TheImmortal70> One tank has to grab two, one grabs the last, and then you dps them down super fast
[6:56:19] <Jolnir> well yeah theyre not going to wait for you
[6:56:21] <%Gogogolem> Thanks have to split up
[6:56:23] <%Mekhet09> Have fun with this.
[6:56:25] <%BlueMoonBlues> pretty good first try tho
[6:56:25] <arkv01> this song has so much sexual energy
[6:56:27] <+lucaflow> Ok gotta grab all three of their hate
[6:56:32] <%ovan20> @Kashishh it's catchy nonsense LUL
[6:56:43] <%Mekhet09> I spent like an hour doing it because my team didn't know what to do at that phase you died at.
[6:56:44] <%Valdorick> Let deeps kill the big tree man, you just gotta pick up aggro on the punch trees.
[6:56:44] <+ozmodek> any idea why they marked C first?
[6:56:47] <+Kashishh> ovan20 true true
[6:56:51] <+ozmodek> B is the most dangerous one
[6:56:52] <%Mekhet09> It's the worst.
[6:56:58] <kaimdrol> the music is not great
[6:56:59] <Menarii> @Kashishh Right?! This is so unexpected but so good for a boss theme!
[6:57:12] <+ozmodek> all the groups I've run this with focus B down first
[6:57:13] <%VantomPayne> most trial theme are on point
[6:57:14] <%vaporousTippler> The music reminds me of Charlie's play in Always Sunny.
[6:57:15] <%Mekhet09> I like lakshimi's more.
[6:57:16] <BunnyEmperor> The order doesnt matter if you kill them all fast
[6:57:24] <+ozmodek> fair point
[6:57:28] <+Kashishh> I'm pumped to hear the rest of the expac music
[6:57:28] <%Gogogolem> Do you think the faieres are upset you killed titania?
[6:57:29] <%Mekhet09> That requires a good lb3.
[6:57:35] <iwasJase> yup, the water pools give fire resist
[6:57:42] <%Zepik> the XIV really not fucking around with the dungeons or trials so far in ShB, it's great
[6:57:42] <+TheImmortal70> The order ABSOLUTELY will matter in hard and ex
[6:57:44] <%Mekhet09> Gogo you'll see the answer to that next time.
[6:57:56] <+ozmodek> blows my mind that PLD isn't popping passage there
[6:58:06] <Commander_Spyke> @ozmodek xenoBrain
[6:58:14] <+ozmodek> right?
[6:58:14] <BunnyEmperor> This PLD doesnt have wings Kappa
[6:58:38] <%ovan20> paladins have their wings clipped so they don't fly away Keepo
[6:58:57] <%Mekhet09> I can look at you fail again while I wait for my unskipable cut scenes to go.
[6:58:57] <%TamsynRRD> Thanks for the PrideAsexual @shogunnoonto
[6:59:05] <+ozmodek> mqn, bet he wont use it on the ult either lol
[6:59:32] <iwasJase> that SAM almost didn't make it LUL
[6:59:48] <floatRand> They do
[6:59:50] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 7 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 28oz (840mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[6:59:56] <iwasJase> they're trees, but they do move LUL
[7:00:04] <Commander_Spyke> jesus

[7:00:27] <Kaede_Viz> the PLD had 3 vul stacks
[7:00:29] <iwasJase> PLD monkaS
[7:00:32] <Jolnir> @AngriestPat AOE lb 2 of those big dudes at once
[7:00:40] <+lucaflow> Mitigation could have saved?
[7:00:44] <iwasJase> ads Phase 2
[7:00:44] <%Valdorick> Let Deeps deal with the stationary tree, looks like each tank has to pick up one of the moving guys and not die to tank busters.
[7:00:58] <+TeethMuncher> What am I even looking at?
[7:00:58] <%BlueMoonBlues> get thru this phase and u should be set
[7:01:04] <Cpt_phantom> Here we go
[7:01:08] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> might need to dps lb
[7:01:19] <+Goliz> when is the gun blade job coming ?
[7:01:25] <Thenuclearwalrus> LUL is your PLD raging?

[7:01:45] <iwasJase> oof
[7:01:47] <%QuadraticGravity> No WHM
[7:01:47] <+Goliz> Really? haven't seen anyone playing it yet
[7:01:49] <%Kain5707> gotta kill Puck
[7:01:51] <%SilvaChariot0133> Are you? no WHM LUL
[7:01:53] <+justianxix> welp
[7:01:55] <Cpt_phantom> Jesus dude, this is quite a fight
[7:01:55] <+lucaflow> No WHM
[7:01:55] <%Roundelay11> DPS isn't pulling their weight anyway
[7:01:57] <BunnyEmperor> You have no WHM Pat...
[7:01:59] <+ozmodek> Middle tree is the worst tree
[7:01:59] <Jolnir> cant make it. cant make it. door stuck!
[7:02:03] <iwasJase> healer LB3
[7:02:06] <%Zepik> yeah as a WHM i was sweating through this fight
[7:02:07] <iwasJase> nvm
[7:02:09] <+seaearthandsky> so this phase is a little intense
[7:02:12] <+justianxix> Pog
[7:02:12] <+ozmodek> and yeah, their dps is meh
[7:02:13] <Notsocleveruser> We had to LB one of the trees
[7:02:14] <%crimsonharvest> I dont get how you're dying you have a scholar and they're sitll op just boring
[7:02:16] <%BlueMoonBlues> gotta hurry
[7:02:24] <%QuadraticGravity> Timer still ticking
[7:02:28] <Jolnir> total wipeout
[7:02:30] <Thenuclearwalrus> Aaaand wipe
[7:02:32] <Jolnir> surfin wipeout
[7:02:32] <%Kain5707> @AngriestPat its recommended you kill Puck first for both phases
[7:02:33] <%BlueMoonBlues> F
[7:02:35] <BunnyEmperor> LULW
[7:02:38] <%Gogogolem> you'red dead
[7:02:42] <iwasJase> you guys will want to focus down on 1 tree while off-tank takes aggro from the 2 other trees @AngriestPat
[7:02:43] <+ozmodek> enrage hit
[7:02:44] <BunnyEmperor> No dps LUL
[7:02:46] <+Zxtole> We used the Ranged LB3 on the 3 big trees
[7:02:46] <%ovan20> F
[7:02:49] <%psychocalibur> try caster lbing the ads
[7:02:49] <Nina96> F
[7:02:51] <%crimsonharvest> dps check not passed
[7:02:52] <+YoungGroose> F
[7:02:53] <%RittiFruity> no deeps
[7:02:55] <%BlueMoonBlues> bring the deeps
[7:02:58] <Jolnir> same @Zxtole
[7:02:59] <+justianxix> damn
[7:02:59] <iwasJase> also, DPS could be better - that was a DPS check
[7:03:00] <%Roundelay11> You need to set up an order for the dps to kill the adds
[7:03:01] <BunnyEmperor> Did you try focusing one target at a time? .lul
[7:03:03] <%Valdorick> Boss just popped their limit break on your ass
[7:03:04] <Kaede_Viz> HEALERS ADJUST
[7:03:04] <%Zepik> we targeted puck first cause he hits like a truck
[7:03:05] <+lucaflow> DPS too low cause party seemed scattered and confused
[7:03:13] <+Sgt_Wigglytuff> PLD needs to take 2 of them and all of your guys need to DPS down quicker
[7:03:14] <%yeknomlive> wouldnt the dnc get more meter if they danced with the mnk?
[7:03:16] <+Ell1ot> i woke up from a big nap. Why does this place sound happy?
[7:03:18] <%SilvaChariot0133> Should we find some replacements?
[7:03:19] <%PinkSuprende> D P S C H E C K

[7:04:19] <CtrlShiftKill> this song lit
[7:04:20] <%Zepik> the big guy add phase is not even the end of the fight, she still has tricks
[7:04:21] <%yeknomlive> it reminds me of katamari
[7:04:21] <%Roundelay11> For an expansions first Trial, Titania is surprisingly involved
[7:04:23] <iwasJase> this track is a B A N G E R
[7:04:28] <Ominnous> This song is atpUgly
[7:04:33] <GeltonZ> I love this song! It goes well with fighting a big fairy!
[7:04:33] <%madhattergay> goin in my work playlist
[7:04:34] <Jolnir> its so different its unlike any other track in the whole game
[7:04:35] <+seaearthandsky> am I the only one who doesn't like this song?
[7:04:42] <%ovan20> @Kashishh there will be a 12 hours long version in youtube before the end of the weekend :P
[7:04:47] <CrypticMochi> It’s a fitting song, I like it
[7:04:50] <%yeknomlive> i like it
[7:04:52] <liflamor> I need the name of this song
[7:04:54] <%Valdorick> He's too good to get in bro
[7:04:57] <%Mekhet09> How many times did he die?
[7:05:00] <KatabolicRage> he doesn't stack either
[7:05:02] <%RittiFruity> he wont die if he ingnore the stack
[7:05:04] <iwasJase> this PLD LUL
[7:05:05] <BunnyEmperor> PLD sprout exemplar
[7:05:05] <+lucaflow> PLD doesn't seem that smart
[7:05:05] <%SilvaChariot0133> Great PLD BTW
[7:05:05] <%MagickBurritoh> song is nice
[7:05:07] <+YoungGroose> He's too goon to get in
[7:05:07] <%yeknomlive> this pld gives 0 fucks
[7:05:09] <Nina96> @Mekhet09 like 5 so far
[7:05:09] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> and thats why this game sucks sometimes
[7:05:12] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> because of bads
[7:05:16] <+ozmodek> that is a fucking galaxy brain pld
[7:05:16] <%ArcanumMBD> must keep boss looking away from group AT ALL TIMES
[7:05:20] <%ArcanumMBD> No matter what!
[7:05:20] <%Valdorick> He can just pop his tanking CDs for the easy to reduce high damage attack Kappa
[7:05:22] <+Kashishh> @ovan20 there better be or I'm making it
[7:05:26] <Nordguy> but rings are bad, pat! Kappa
[7:05:26] <BunnyEmperor> If you dont know what to do just mimic the party like really FailFish
[7:05:30] <+Masutasodo> He thinks that's a go away marker Kappa
[7:05:35] <+Unlimited_Rulebook> Am i a bad person if I enjoy watching these mofs struggle :D
[7:05:39] <%yeknomlive> when in doubt follow the healers
[7:05:45] <iwasJase> oof, too close
[7:05:46] <Cpt_phantom> I don't mind under average players if they're willing to learn, but sometimes, you know
[7:05:48] <RavenHellkite> i would tank this with you if i was on ultros
[7:05:50] <+YoungGroose> monkaS
[7:05:52] <%Valdorick> He got your toe, oof
[7:05:54] <%ovan20> @Masutasodo the arrows pointing in are just a trap Kappa
[7:05:59] <Kaede_Viz> regression
[7:06:10] <Cranky_Construct> this is really making me want to try playing ff14 again
[7:06:14] <iwasJase> oh wait till Extreme Pat. Since you will need to farm that for weapons.
[7:06:23] <%madhattergay> does pat have any ranged or is it all tank all day?
[7:06:27] <Retinolgaming> @AngriestPat Where can I find your FF14 UI/Hotbar guide? I'm a returning player.
[7:07:04] <+ozmodek> he recently posted it on YouTube
[7:07:08] <lpkilledthetelltalestar> Pat answer my riddles three
[7:07:10] <%ovan20> @Retinolgaming there's a stream/guide he did for beginners, it's on his youtube channel
[7:07:11] <+Greerhead> This track is dope
[7:07:20] <iwasJase> DRG LUL
[7:07:22] <%Valdorick> You say, as Vento dies
[7:07:24] <Cpt_phantom> @Retinolgaming check his YouTube: Pat Stares At
[7:07:26] <iwasJase> rip
[7:07:35] <Retinolgaming> @ovan20 @Cpt_phantom Thanks!
[7:07:39] <%madhattergay> ah yes the best way to make a boss fight more fun: ADDS
[7:07:39] <iwasJase> jump animation lock maybe?
[7:08:01] <floatRand> 3 lustrates back-to-back, what
[7:08:04] <+ozmodek> I feel bad for pat tbh; this group's dps is really low
[7:08:12] <%Valdorick> Maybe you just Crazy Talked the poor fucker
[7:08:14] <%rdark_ksu> this is weird fight music
[7:08:15] <iwasJase> Puck is B
[7:08:18] <iwasJase> middle
[7:08:23] <+TheImmortal70> Which is wild with a Dancer, Samurai, Drg, and MONK
[7:08:24] <%madhattergay> enyone else thinking rita repulsa?
[7:08:30] <%weissguard> So I stepped out for a while. I come back to THIS?
[7:08:32] <%weissguard> PogChamp
[7:08:47] <%ovan20> @rdark_ksu the witcher 3 has a marriage song for fights :P
[7:08:57] <Cpt_phantom> What's everyone's initial thoughts on Dancer and Gunblade so far?
[7:09:01] <Maverick2736> this phase looks insane
[7:09:04] <%crimsonharvest> cause the fight isnt over
[7:09:04] <+ozmodek> couldnt the dancer LB3 two of them?
[7:09:10] <RavenHellkite> lb is a dps loss Kappa
[7:09:13] <BunnyEmperor> maybe they dont know how to LB LUL
[7:09:17] <+StrawberryPantsu> THIS THEME THOUGH
[7:09:18] <%yeknomlive> where's allisae when you need her
[7:09:19] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> you arent going to make it
[7:09:20] <iwasJase> @TheImmortal70 IDK man, only SAM and DNC sync since DRG's pierce debuff is wasted on MNK
[7:09:20] <%QuadraticGravity> Oh my god please LB
[7:09:22] <%Roundelay11> It's best to LB this phase, yeah
[7:09:25] <Jolnir> nah just lb 2 at once straight away
[7:09:29] <%Fatmanjoggin> the EX for this is gonna be nuts
[7:09:30] <iwasJase> and MNK will need positionals to do decent DPS
[7:09:31] <%ovan20> F
[7:09:34] <RavenHellkite> crazy talk
[7:09:35] <%weissguard> OOF
[7:09:40] <%Valdorick> apatCrazy
[7:09:43] <%yeknomlive> healer lb?
[7:09:44] <%ovan20> crazy talk was imediate on this try LUL
[7:09:45] <+ozmodek> THEY ARE OMNIPOSITIONAL
[7:09:45] <Jolnir> it took me about 2 hours
[7:09:46] <snowmanse> Might be time for a party refresh
[7:09:46] <%Thetulev> apatCrazyhead apatCrazyhead apatCrazyhead
[7:09:47] <%Valdorick> Just gonna keep killing them, Pat
[7:09:48] <iwasJase> healer LB3

[7:10:06] <+ozmodek> the monk could just blow them up
[7:10:10] <Nina96> @madhattergay yeah it kinda does
[7:10:11] <%blastyoboots> blastyoboots subscribed at Tier 1. 
[7:10:14] <%Roundelay11> Pat gettin' frustrated
[7:10:15] <BunnyEmperor> How can you wipe so many times to this LUL
[7:10:16] <+TheImmortal70> @iwasJase The debuff anyways, also the problem is that they have a STACKED dps party
[7:10:16] <Jolnir> angry pattu
[7:10:17] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> vote abandon and refresh tbh
[7:10:23] <+TheImmortal70> @iwasJase Like an overly stacked one

[7:10:32] <+Kang_Artur> moon2A
[7:10:32] <%BlueMoonBlues> titania's the new casual filter
[7:10:33] <%Valdorick> Yeah, that's certainty a dps check phase, and needs limit break used.
[7:10:33] <+sixcubit> what does that C and A mean?
[7:10:35] <+ozmodek> Pat these people are legit bad
[7:10:42] <%ArcanumMBD> Man did i just get absurdly lucky with my group that beat it first try?
[7:10:44] <KatabolicRage> my first run went smooth

[7:10:50] <+StrawberryPantsu> WoW player
[7:10:51] <%Kain5707> @AngriestPat MT has to tank Puck you need to take the other 2 its to much damage
[7:10:54] <Cpt_phantom> A healer who won't heal, feels bad man
[7:10:59] <%ovan20> so, what does the party needs to do to avoid the big explosion wipe?
[7:11:00] <Jolnir> i main dps healer fuck you
[7:11:00] <+ozmodek> you need a better 2nd healer
[7:11:03] <chisanakitsune> We did it in one

[7:11:44] <%Mekhet09> You don't have a caster Lb3.
[7:11:47] <iwasJase> ngl, i'd find another group
[7:11:47] <%Guardiansaiyan> Hello?
[7:11:48] <%Valdorick> Oh mah gawd Pat, why are you so toxic!? /s
[7:11:49] <+Sgt_Wigglytuff> Tanks like that PLD are the worst man
[7:11:50] <%Mekhet09> That's probably your biggest issue.
[7:11:53] <+Pyr0_Fr0st> Looks like someone needs a boot
[7:11:54] <redrins> vote kick that asshole, not even worth it
[7:11:55] <%yeknomlive> yeah but dnc has the pierce lb
[7:11:56] <$rekinom> God I love Titania's theme
[7:11:58] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> ranged lb should hit across the map at least
[7:12:00] <Jolnir> any aoe will do though
[7:12:00] <weewii> right-click report his ass
[7:12:02] <%Roundelay11> It's rough when one of the tanks and one of the healers are bads
[7:12:02] <BunnyEmperor> Dancer can LB 2 adds if he aims correctly
[7:12:07] <Thenuclearwalrus> @Guardiansaiyan Not sure what the song is called, but if you look up Titania's Theme someone will have it
[7:12:07] <iwasJase> the PLD and AST are oof
[7:12:11] <%Valdorick> PLD noooooooooooooooooo
[7:12:15] <Nina96> PLD Y!?
[7:12:15] <Jolnir> once you get over that hump its honestly plain sailing
[7:12:19] <%BlueMoonBlues> His brain dont work good
[7:12:20] <%QuadraticGravity> Just /p Hey paladin the puddles are good
[7:12:23] <kaimdrol> GET FISTED
[7:12:24] <+Unlimited_Rulebook> Is pat getting stream sniped
[7:12:26] <iwasJase> he doesn't want FIRE RESIST Pat
[7:12:27] <RavenHellkite> this pld is so bad
[7:12:28] <iwasJase> LUL
[7:12:31] <%QuadraticGravity> or kick
[7:12:38] <iwasJase> check if he's boosted LUL
[7:12:41] <Nina96> this is the true ff14 experience
[7:12:44] <%Roundelay11> Vote abandon and give it another shot with a new party
[7:12:45] <BunnyEmperor> :lul boosted PLD
[7:12:47] <%Valdorick> 50% of his HP, no problem, healers adjust.
[7:12:49] <%crimsonharvest> tryina get that vulnerability debuff i guess
[7:12:52] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> DF is forever a mystery
[7:12:52] <%yeknomlive> he went full tunnel vision. i saw him casting holyspirit
[7:13:01] <+Greerhead> me mt, provoke on cd always
[7:13:01] <Thenuclearwalrus> He also got a vuln from that
[7:13:07] <+TheImmortal70> @angriestpat Listen man, if this fails one more time disband and go for another party, these guys aren't learning any time soon
[7:13:07] <Thenuclearwalrus> What a moron
[7:13:09] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> shitty DF people are arguably the worst part about this game
[7:13:11] <BunnyEmperor> He probably doesnt know the rotation
[7:13:14] <+Fynale> "bro i tanked mythic grimjow i can tank this baby weeb content" = some wow refugee probably
[7:13:14] <%Zepik> cause MT easier most of the time, just stand and get hit. OT usually has to pick up adds and do mechanics
[7:13:14] <%ovan20> healers should be rename to babysitters Kappa
[7:13:16] <%Roundelay11> NICE
[7:13:24] <%Guardiansaiyan> NVM...got it! ***
[7:13:26] <%VantomPayne> did he just run INTO the roots
[7:13:29] <%Valdorick> Didn't even move her for the melee to help out : /
[7:13:30] <+ozmodek> I've never seen a tank just live in the voidzones like that
[7:13:32] <Nina96> prob will tbh
[7:13:36] <%QuadraticGravity> Just vote remove him
[7:13:48] <iwasJase> vote remove the PLD and the AST
[7:13:50] <theamazingroberto> are all of them "real" people?
[7:13:58] <weewii> don't stand IN THE DEATH!
[7:14:00] <RavenHellkite> nah the other healer isn't any better either
[7:14:07] <RavenHellkite> disbanding is the best option if wipe
[7:14:09] <%VantomPayne> well Thancred would have done way better
[7:14:10] <Thenuclearwalrus> @theamazingroberto Yep these are all real players
[7:14:11] <%Jarvanii> titania wiped everyone but the tank cause she was facing the wrong way my first time apatLiz
[7:14:16] <iwasJase> oh btw, MCH is so fun now. holy shit.
[7:14:18] <%Zepik> i had one this morning in a dungeon roulette that REFUSED to use his tank stance. We tried to deal best we could but kicked him after 2nd boss
[7:14:21] <Thenuclearwalrus> Can't do Trials with Trust
[7:14:26] <+Karasseram> act worknig again is going to be so enlightening XD
[7:14:36] <+Karasseram> Thenuclearwalrus I wish we could lol
[7:14:42] <Cpt_phantom> Yeah, where's Thancred when you need a main tank
[7:14:42] <%ovan20> @weewii it's not death, the warning is yellow, it just me slow down Kappa
[7:14:48] <Menarii> I've been leveling up a ninja but man, is anyone else feeling that they just have a ton of ogcd's to hammer now?
[7:14:49] <%QuadraticGravity> The astro and paladin are legit blowing it
[7:14:57] <iwasJase> ^this
[7:14:58] <%Valdorick> So I'm guessing in the next phase, the PLD should take Puck, since Pat will have vuln? Am I close to the idea of this boss fight in a game I do not play?
[7:15:05] <+Karasseram> hello res the dnc?
[7:15:16] <+Zxtole> People get very defensive when you ask them to stop ruining content as well. It's very strange
[7:15:16] <+ozmodek> the PLD should be offtank here tbh
[7:15:17] <+Karasseram> no lets jsut seven man this
[7:15:24] <RavenHellkite> nice
[7:15:27] <+Zxtole> Even if you try to explain it, they just ignore it and continue to hold everyone hostage
[7:15:27] <floatRand> Finally got the MSQ roulette done. 11 million exp at 76
[7:15:29] <+Karasseram> our dps is so great anyway
[7:15:42] <+ozmodek> intervention applied to Blackest Night is more worth it
[7:15:48] <%Zepik> yeah but if I was pat I wouldnt trust that PLD to OT and pick up the adds
[7:15:50] <%RittiFruity> BIG!
[7:15:51] <Nina96> wait wa happend?
[7:15:54] <%BlueMoonBlues> paige sounds fucking pissed
[7:15:58] <+ozmodek> pat has better immediate on demand mitigation
[7:15:59] <%weissguard> Is Paige okay?
[7:16:00] <%QuadraticGravity> Tell them to damage LB
[7:16:03] <+Karasseram> and no resses still?
[7:16:05] <+Karasseram> <_<
[7:16:05] <%weissguard> Are you okay?
[7:16:07] <Cpt_phantom> yeah this is looking bad already, what do you dp
[7:16:11] <Cpt_phantom> do
[7:16:16] <+Karasseram> they let the dnc be dead 3 mins
[7:16:21] <+ozmodek> but that is applied to a competent party
[7:16:22] <iwasJase> stack
[7:16:23] <iwasJase> LUL
[7:16:24] <%crimsonharvest> I'm judging your healers, I wish I could jump in and help but im on Sarg
[7:16:27] <+Karasseram> cause they are literally retarded
[7:16:32] <Cpt_phantom> Wait Paige, some stranger entered your home?
[7:16:33] <Nina96> wait what happend paige?
[7:16:35] <zamzoph> SourPls
[7:16:36] <%ovan20> F
[7:16:39] <fairore> wait what
[7:16:42] <%Faustgesicht> wat
[7:16:45] <%madhattergay> theres an echo-y beep every so often and it kinda sounds like peach is messing with a microwave in the other room
[7:16:45] <iwasJase> Strident is doing great actually, imagine healing solo on a full party LUL
[7:16:49] <%Mekhet09> you aren't going to make it.
[7:16:52] <%Faustgesicht> Home-break0in
[7:16:54] <BunnyEmperor> monkaS
[7:16:56] <thwak> ...
[7:17:01] <%QuadraticGravity> DPS still refusing to LB
[7:17:01] <%BlueMoonBlues> wait a minute thats illegal
[7:17:01] <Cpt_phantom> Oh, dafuq
[7:17:03] <%weissguard> ??? That's not appropriate at all.
[7:17:05] <RavenHellkite> never lb
[7:17:05] <%Thetulev> wow that is not ok
[7:17:07] <%Faustgesicht> oh.....
[7:17:08] <+Retrokay> LOL wtf that's wild
[7:17:08] <Nina96> wtf
[7:17:09] <%Kain5707> Pat may save this
[7:17:16] <Jolnir> call the police
[7:17:18] <BunnyEmperor> LULW what if you were in the shower or something? WTF
[7:17:19] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> enrage
[7:17:20] <weewii> @ovan20 oops, WoW baby here, not familiar with game but I'm interested in picking up something new. This looks pretty cool so far.
[7:17:20] <Cpt_phantom> Fuck that guy
[7:17:21] <%madhattergay> what the actual fuck
[7:17:21] <+El_Bucephalus> He will save this
[7:17:21] <@Velyndra> this other tank is the worst
[7:17:22] <+Estuko> that's how people get shot
[7:17:23] <%BlueMoonBlues> you stopped a burglary
[7:17:23] <Jolnir> file a report
[7:17:24] <%yeknomlive> goodbye
[7:17:25] <BunnyEmperor> Or like half naked?
[7:17:26] <%Kain5707> kick this tank
[7:17:27] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> dps is absolutely garbage
[7:17:31] <iwasJase> kick PLD and AST
[7:17:32] <+seaearthandsky> why wasn't the door locked?
[7:17:32] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> throw the whole party out
[7:17:32] <$rekinom> He shoved you? what the fuck
[7:17:33] <%ArcanumMBD> Dont keep your defense weapon next to the door. If they get into your house, free weapon
[7:17:33] <Jolnir> he could be a burglar scout
[7:17:37] <PsychedelicSamurai> Oh my god why no DPS LB?
[7:17:38] <%RittiFruity> do you guys even dps?
[7:17:39] <Cpt_phantom> @weewii welcome, this game is rad
[7:17:41] <BunnyEmperor> Yeah pat and friends get a better group
[7:17:41] <%Zepik> la la la la la
[7:17:42] <%Faustgesicht> get name, and report him Paige
[7:17:44] <+ozmodek> this whole thing is a huge yikes
[7:17:44] <%QuadraticGravity> Just vote dismiss though?
[7:17:47] <+Sgt_Wigglytuff> They really need to focus 1 done at a time
[7:17:50] <%Kain5707> just kick the tank
[7:17:51] <%ovan20> @weewii i'm just joking :P
[7:17:54] <Zebroneath> Just tuned back in. What's the issue?
[7:17:54] <+Sgt_Wigglytuff> down*
[7:17:55] <%SilvaChariot0133> HARD mode abandon FeelsBadMan
[7:17:57] <%yeknomlive> it's not just the tank
[7:17:58] <$SinisterBroccoli> This Extreme?
[7:17:58] <%Valdorick> The PLD isn't the only issue
[7:17:58] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> dismissing a tank isnt going to fix dps
[7:18:01] <iwasJase> it also feels like the DPS are still learning their new rotation?
[7:18:07] <PsychedelicSamurai> DPS doesn’t know how to LB apparently
[7:18:07] <jackythefrost> I've never seen a PLD this bad before
[7:18:07] <$KnivesEve> damn is it bad? came back
[7:18:08] <+cawi> DPS was LB3 one of the ads during this phase.
[7:18:09] <%madhattergay> no the tank and second healer are both trash
[7:18:10] <TioXyco> @SinisterBroccoli this msq

[7:18:41] <+Zxtole> It's always the shit players that are so defensive
[7:18:42] <%snow_bush> He sucks as a healer then
[7:18:45] <KatabolicRage> the fuck does that healer do in 4mans?
[7:18:48] <+Fynale> there were guides for this fight before THE EXPAC CAME OUT
[7:18:48] <etbarni> :P
[7:18:49] <%Valdorick> Healer - DPSing; Pick One.
[7:18:50] <Sarl109> funny when healers are gonna have to learn how to heal
[7:18:52] <+VariantX7> LMAO, do your job
[7:18:53] <+ozmodek> the healer should be healing instead of dpsing
[7:18:53] <theamazingroberto> man this really is just like wow
[7:18:54] <RavenHellkite> "i have fun with no healing as a healer"
[7:18:56] <%Thetulev> yeah dont be nice to someone intruding
[7:19:02] <+seaearthandsky> @AngriestPat why was the door unlocked?
[7:19:04] <etbarni> pee on him! assert dominance~
[7:19:05] <KUYAmoPESh> @AngriestPat What server are you playing in, if it's ok to ask?
[7:19:05] <+ozmodek> dps comes after being comfortable in your healing lol
[7:19:07] <zamzoph> What's Paige talking about?
[7:19:08] <Jolnir> fucking do something about it
[7:19:08] <%Bigdrifter210> FailFish pubs man
[7:19:09] <Nina96> NO FUCK HIM THAT GuY PAIGE
[7:19:16] <Kghaleon> Shirk is the best ability to use on healers.
[7:19:17] <Cpt_phantom> Healer might be top of the DPS list that time, though, considering
[7:19:18] <%Valdorick> @seaearthandsky It was the food delivery guy.
[7:19:20] <iwasJase> the Extreme version of this will eat your ass Pat LUL
[7:19:27] <%Faustgesicht> Dude, seriously Report him @AngriestPat
[7:19:27] <+VashyronM> ...what? He queues up for Healer role and doesn't heal and you're the problem? Wtf?
[7:19:32] <Mattcowdisease6> did you lose weight? somethings different
[7:19:33] <%yeknomlive> wtf???
[7:19:34] <+Pyr0_Fr0st> @AngriestPat Scrubquotes- FFXIV Edition
[7:19:35] <%Thetulev> stay safe, dont be polite
[7:19:40] <zamzoph> Wait, they live in a house, right? Not an apartment or something?
[7:19:44] <%weissguard> Yes
[7:19:46] <BunnyEmperor> Thats like trespassing
[7:19:46] <%Valdorick> Indeed
[7:19:48] <+seaearthandsky> @Valdorick I got that, the door was unlocked though because the guy got in
[7:19:49] <%Mekhet09> house.
[7:19:50] <+Caped_Eggy> Just shoot them like we do down here
[7:19:53] <%BlueMoonBlues> @zamzoph yes
[7:19:55] <+Karasseram> I got a sword if someone barges in on me
[7:19:56] <@Velyndra> FYI, I asked the off tank which add he wanted
[7:19:58] <+donpatrondx> that party was so bad that I caught up
[7:20:01] <@Velyndra> he said "the tree"
[7:20:02] <iwasJase> oh WAR
[7:20:02] <%Bigdrifter210> if that happened where i live dude would've got punched in the face
[7:20:04] <@Velyndra> I want to die
[7:20:05] <Nina96> that sounded scary af paige
[7:20:05] <%Valdorick> Paige opened the door and went to get her wallet to pay him.
[7:20:08] <Thenuclearwalrus> @Velyndra LUL
[7:20:08] <%Lapinelis> I suppose I got lucky in one shoting Titania
[7:20:09] <%BaeD_JD> "the tree"
[7:20:16] <%Guardiansaiyan> Tatania Theme right here! ***
[7:20:18] <thwak> well yeah the tree
[7:20:21] <Onillius> Castle law man look it up
[7:20:22] <iwasJase> double SCH, and a WAR. Should be a better run.
[7:20:25] <%Mekhet09> it's the common one pat.
[7:20:25] <zamzoph> SourPls
[7:20:26] <Cpt_phantom> Yeah, lame ass pub lobbies bum me out as well
[7:20:28] <%Kain5707> cool War

[7:20:34] <Nina96> SourPls
[7:20:35] <+Masutasodo> Warbros
[7:20:36] <%yeknomlive> rip deliverance D:
[7:20:37] <Maverick2736> @AngriestPat you really should report that guy to the authorities. Could've been scouting around to see what's the best time to rob you guys
[7:20:40] <%sshen> You were all doing great, especially Stri as he was essentinally solo healing a trial
[7:20:41] <Stari> SourPls
[7:20:42] <iwasJase> already a better start FeelsGoodMan
[7:20:44] <%MysteryFaceX> is pay obligated to go to Rooster Teeth due to all their stream donations?
[7:20:46] <Calek> what's this? coordination and cooperation in MY MMO? it's more likely than you think
[7:20:49] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat bad experience all around. Pat needs to report a healer, and Paige needs to report a stealer.
[7:20:53] <%Kain5707> cool axe
[7:21:00] <+army_of_flies> i fuckin love this song
[7:21:00] <+Estuko> 100% report that sketchy dude
[7:21:03] <%og_lunchbox> this sounds like a Nier song
[7:21:04] <kaimdrol> god this music ><
[7:21:09] <iwasJase> is he rocking the Shiva axe?
[7:21:09] <Nina96> stri was doing amazing for solo healing
[7:21:11] <Rawpost> rooting for vento oreo
[7:21:11] <weewii> @ovan20 lol, thanks for letting me know man, I'm pretty slow on the uptake for most things, so bear with me when I no understand.
[7:21:16] <Cpt_phantom> Still weird to me that Protect is gone
[7:21:20] <zamzoph> Does that Dancer have a Lightning outfit?
[7:21:31] <+SlowLikeThunder> I've been loving bosses so far
[7:21:32] <Nina96> did u check if he stole something paige?
[7:21:33] <%weissguard> That Dancer has a COOL Lightning outfit.
[7:21:34] <+Artemis_Scowl> I love this music
[7:21:34] <+SlowLikeThunder> even the dungeon ones
[7:21:36] <%Kain5707> protect was just a crutch
[7:21:40] <$SGrim> FeelsGoodMan I contrubited to Pat's minimal joy FeelsGoodMan
[7:21:43] <BunnyEmperor> @zamzoph yeah
[7:21:43] <%weissguard> The difference? Sunglasses.
[7:21:46] <Jolnir> ill smoke that cigarette for you to get cancer and prove to you its harmful you dumb asshole
[7:21:49] <+SlowLikeThunder> they've had fun mechanics all around
[7:21:52] <kaimdrol> now watch pat screw everything up by being main tank :)
[7:21:53] <%yeknomlive> it's cool lightning
[7:21:56] <+SlowLikeThunder> not just boring tank and spank
[7:21:58] <%og_lunchbox> Square's patented Lightning Everywhere system
[7:22:00] <Jolnir> cold fire
[7:22:01] <Cpt_phantom> I guess @Kain5707 but I guess more of the routine of it, I mean
[7:22:02] <+Artemis_Scowl> It sounds like its just straight out of Nier
[7:22:12] <+TheImmortal70> @angriestpat Barely
[7:22:13] <%salty_syd913> nicw
[7:22:14] <%salty_syd913> nice
[7:22:38] <%Kain5707> @Cpt_phantom the problem was healers used it as a crutch to heal less and dps more, which isnt a bad thing but i guess they want them to focus more on healing
[7:22:52] <iwasJase> bringing the stack to MT already a better run
[7:22:55] <Cpt_phantom> that's fair
[7:23:08] <Nina96> this is going better
[7:23:13] <+SlowLikeThunder> @iwasJase to be fair you need to stack in one of the puddles
[7:23:13] <%ovan20> @Kain5707 you'r talking about scholars?
[7:23:13] <%Kain5707> i mean we saw what happens when 1 healer doesnt do their job just now
[7:23:18] <Cpt_phantom> I started at the end of Heavensward as my first MMO, so I'm just new, I guess
[7:23:18] <KUYAmoPESh> Anybody knows what Pat's server at?
[7:23:22] <+SlowLikeThunder> so in some situations I would actually prefer not to move
[7:23:25] <%Kain5707> any healer @ovan20
[7:23:32] <+SlowLikeThunder> because doing that part of the mechanic right is more important
[7:23:36] <%QuadraticGravity> @KUYAmoPESh no
[7:23:44] <viciousgrim> ha Peach will you and pat ever play MH?
[7:23:54] <iwasJase> @SlowLikeThunder yup, wasn't being sarcastic if it came off that way they were in the puddle so it's good
[7:24:02] <%ovan20> healers dpsing is nonsense, at best they are crappy DPS at worst they are actively making the fight harder
[7:24:09] <KUYAmoPESh> @QuadraticGravity ok, thanks
[7:24:20] <iwasJase> bringing stack to MT just shares thedamage to more so it's more optimal
[7:24:20] <+SirSamVimes> @ovan20 healers dpsing is what they're meant to do in this game
[7:24:23] <BunnyEmperor> You got bloodshield its fine
[7:24:24] <Thenuclearwalrus> @ovan20 you're trolling right?
[7:24:29] <%TG_Cid11> TG_Cid11 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months, currently on a 5 month streak! Titania a cutie
[7:24:34] <+Sgt_Wigglytuff> might actually wanna die bfore that next phase
[7:24:43] <%Kain5707> healer dps makes a huge difference in fights
[7:24:45] <+Can_Do_Kamel> wow you're still on this boss? she looks tough!
[7:24:45] <+Retrokay> @ovan20 sound like you havent played much ffxiv lol
[7:24:55] <+Zxtole> Healer dpsing is the reward for good healing.
[7:24:58] <+PrincessLuna85> @AngriestPat hey not sure if its the same dude or someone watching your stream but a guy in the novice chat was just complaining about you making the game toxic LOL
[7:25:01] <iwasJase> yeah, he is LUL
[7:25:03] <zamzoph> Puck is ALWAYS an asshole
[7:25:05] <+Karasseram> fuck puck
[7:25:06] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> crappy dps is better than no dps
[7:25:06] <%PanicSwytch> SourPls odd soundtrack for this dungeon. Odd but not bad.
[7:25:06] <%Kain5707> Berserk
[7:25:09] <AdmiralButtloaf> is nobody tanking mustardseed?
[7:25:13] <pectusumbra> Dota 2
[7:25:17] <+ozmodek> hope that RDM LBs
[7:25:18] <+G_Thunders> Yeah wait I only played this for a weekend and even I remember I was supposed to dps as a healer
[7:25:19] <Cpt_phantom> lol nice @PrincessLuna85 maybe it was that PLD
[7:25:25] <Cpt_phantom> or that healer
[7:25:29] <+Zxtole> Everything is toxic nowadays lol
[7:25:36] <+SirSamVimes> The conjurer questline even has an NPC who exists to say "you shouldn't just cast healing spells"
[7:25:39] <Thenuclearwalrus> This is a fight where Caster LB3 is actually the best option which is cool
[7:25:40] <%Kain5707> its not a hard fight if everyone does their job
[7:25:41] <zamzoph> monkaS
[7:25:43] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> its toxic if you wanna clear fights
[7:25:45] <Cpt_phantom> clean fight so far, Patrick
[7:25:51] <%Roundelay11> Cause they're at least mildly competant
[7:26:00] <+Estuko> @ItsYaGirlMaria it's toxic if you want to enjoy the content by WINNING
[7:26:03] <+Karasseram> caster lb gogo
[7:26:05] <Nina96> i wonder what colors Titania was before they got all fucked up
[7:26:29] <Monkeyweed21> fa la la la
[7:26:37] <iwasJase> but Pat, let people enjoy the new content Kappa
[7:26:39] <ClumzyDragon> :o what is this someone doing there job :o
[7:26:49] <Bailey__gaming> chill music <3
[7:26:50] <Menarii> You only truly realize how bad a group was after you do a fight with a good one
[7:26:52] <%Kain5707> such a good fight
[7:26:59] <+Karasseram> no caster lb
[7:27:01] <BunnyEmperor> Good party
[7:27:02] <Thenuclearwalrus> You should LB the adds, you will gain a full 3 bars again before the fight ends
[7:27:03] <+Karasseram> missing dps check
[7:27:05] <RavenHellkite> didn't even use an lb
[7:27:08] <iwasJase> cutting it a little close but good job
[7:27:09] <RavenHellkite> nice
[7:27:09] <weewii> I have only seen a few healer/dps roles in other mmo's, and their usually relegated to niche roles ( fistweaver monk, and disc. priest to name two).
[7:27:10] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> damn, didnt even need lb
[7:27:11] <%AraghastTheVintager> AraghastTheVintager subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months, currently on a 4 month streak! 
[7:27:12] <Cpt_phantom> nice
[7:27:13] <+Sgt_Wigglytuff> Time to spare aswell
[7:27:14] <BunnyEmperor> Nah you dont need it if you got good dps
[7:27:15] <%BaeD_JD> what is a "heal"
[7:27:15] <+Karasseram> lucky
[7:27:20] <Calek> now the fun begins
[7:27:30] <Cpt_phantom> phase 3?
[7:27:30] <RavenHellkite> no guys it's toxic
[7:27:30] <+justianxix> PogChamp
[7:27:32] <Thenuclearwalrus> Now its easy from here on

[7:43:33] <%Mekhet09> Basically if you summon a retainer you get her.
[7:43:33] <+EvilSoully> Titania is male, everyone
[7:43:33] <KatabolicRage> I honestly don't know why they go to these lengths to justify the retainer
[7:43:36] <pectusumbra> it's not 'useful' it's 'interesting
[7:43:38] <+Ell1ot> there should be a pixie mount where like 30 pixies pick you up and carry your everywhere
[7:43:38] <KatabolicRage> why can't feo ul give me a goddamn haircut
[7:43:40] <$SGrim> one* FUCK]

[7:44:06] <+TheImmortal70> @Mysteryfacex the clothes gathered would let the person who slayed Titania to take their place. She took it for us.
