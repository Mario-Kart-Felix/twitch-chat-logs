[0:23:54] <BriscoBrongo> I no longer blame Pat for my OCD.
[0:23:56] <@SoFarFetched> You get repeats on the lore possibly later.
[0:24:01] <%crimsonharvest> Getting blood in there isnt that weird, if you abuse the prostate zone its really easy to cause bruising
[0:24:01] <%nepwar> its more like comics since you gotta watch the picardo streams

[0:24:41] <mcarora19> Pat comics work the same way and you hate them.
[0:24:44] <CursedNobleman> bloodsemen guy just needs to have get laid with a lady on her period to cure both of their problems

[0:25:19] <majima666> especially knowing his kid was in the front row

[0:25:42] <MattyValor> I fell out of World right Iceborne got announced
[0:25:45] <%debugdrawray_> they lock too many monsters behind the guiding lands, should just be quests
[0:25:46] <+lupinelass120> There's like G3 Teo, Kushala, etc. but that's it
[0:25:48] <+Finaldragoon> 4U was ruined by 140 Relic Quests

[1:21:57] <%sexdrugsvideogames> Poser
[1:21:59] <BaslerJones> has pat tried vr yet
[1:22:01] <%BeezusHrist> @Medicwine Texas, Floridumb, and Arizona are competing for stupidity supremacy
[1:22:02] <reonome> superhot vr is a different game
[1:22:03] <%tigerfang86> godDAMN
[1:22:03] <%dukenux> this one not, but ther is SuperHOT VR
[1:22:20] <%michingmallecho> Death stranding preloaded and my body is ready

[1:22:39] <+britishfrog> God SuperHot VR is so great. It's absolutely my go to for demos
[1:22:40] <%DedlokPM> @chiazamformerlymankeyfigh will more than likely not as it will require a rework from the ground up according the faq

[1:22:44] <%chiazamformerlymankeyfigh> Why did Pat forget he had charge?
[1:22:48] <gordieda20> F
[1:22:50] <%dukenux> good choice with that grenade hack Kappa
[1:22:53] <%likethemusiq> CHARGE
[1:22:55] <%sexdrugsvideogames> They can very well calculate where you will be where in the room
[1:22:57] <%apostateCourier> you didn't lose charge because you got the grenades
[1:23:02] <+cvp5127> "lead your shots" the game
[1:23:19] <+xeros720> lol
[1:23:22] <kiwicoffin> This is why charge is superior
[1:23:31] <+Medicwine> he's holding it ssidewaqys thats a killshot!
[1:23:36] <+thedarknightprinny> in a world made of glass, everything can be fixed with a hammer XD
[1:23:43] <%srkAres> thats not an easel

[1:23:53] <%SilvaChariot0133> Palette
[1:23:55] <%DappercatEsquire> So does this game have any meta progression aside from the per level upgrades? Is that charge a permanent thing?
[1:23:55] <+tigerfang86> A PLEXIGLASS PALLET
[1:23:58] <%sexdrugsvideogames> Punch bro
[1:23:59] <%tigerfang86> FOR MURDER

[1:24:15] <+twohitgood> e-sul
[1:24:19] <%BeezusHrist> @Medicwine Texas and Az have just about the same amount of dumb, the difference is they do not nationalize people's arrest records like Flridumb does. Floridumb does that to shame criminals, but it just shames Floridumb
[1:24:21] <%lockhead45> Pat you know you can jump right?
[1:24:22] <DSD24> Charging Star!
[1:24:27] <%BallerSwagBro9k> HAPPY LITTLE ACCIDENTS KappaRoss
[1:24:40] <Ell1ot> can you dance?
[1:24:44] <%apostateCourier> not fast move?
[1:24:45] <EmpZergg> @PatStaresAt "core" upgrades are permanent and then you get randomized hack upgrades throughout each level
[1:24:52] <%BallerSwagBro9k> If you want to
[1:24:56] <%SirGO0SE> especially as you get older FeelsBadMan
[1:24:56] <%qazwsxedc168> are there boses or anything or is it just a random run of levels?
[1:25:06] <%sexdrugsvideogames> Can you Charge with katana?
[1:25:06] <hamahiroyuki> you can reflect bullets with the katana right?
[1:25:07] <%chiazamformerlymankeyfigh> Yeah but now you can pull off sick 360 no scope dropshots
[1:25:08] <RedoctoberWolf> mabye if you don't wanna move from spot but pass time you jump
[1:25:10] <%Double_Tap_That> If you hold jump you go in slow mo
[1:25:11] <$QueequegTheater> NOTHING PERSONNEL
[1:25:19] <%BeezusHrist> @Medicwine But we are a republic so... there's that
[1:25:36] <+Medicwine> @BeezusHrist Ameridumb
[1:25:37] <EmpZergg> I like that the pipe bent as you hit people
[1:25:39] <TioXyco> huh... he just grabed the pipe you threw
[1:25:43] <%ArcanumArcanum> jumping moves faster than walking, but the trade off is time moves faster. You can do some sick dodges with jumps
[1:25:45] <%sexdrugsvideogames> Nice

[1:42:51] <%sexdrugsvideogames> Weak spot
[1:43:16] <NanayaPeng> Red animu swimsuit
[1:43:17] <+brave_sj> This game is accurate, white people's weak spots are wherever we've been sunburned
[1:43:20] <Aydarkzero> too close LUL
[1:43:34] <%TrafficCohen> Carhole
[1:43:52] <%heartlesshealer> I believe people who have only played the VR version exist -somewhere-

[1:44:00] <Jp_DrZaius> LUL
[1:44:02] <usotaku013666> What kind of moron wears body armor everywhere except one arm or everywhere except their torso?

[1:44:18] <OldManDeckardCain> your "zoning shots" won't work on those guys LUL
[1:44:40] <%Treuan> I've only played VR
[1:44:46] <%sexdrugsvideogames> Explosions, environmental damage
[1:44:48] <Ipsenscastle> remember when this was just a browser game? I'm so glad it's come this far
[1:45:00] <%heartlesshealer> neat, must be an interesting perspective seeing people play the game and actively moving around all precise like this :0
[1:45:14] <%Double_Tap_That> "Do you guys take credit?" SUPERHOT Man
[1:45:16] <%sexdrugsvideogames> @ipsenscastle really? Damn
[1:45:30] <%sexdrugsvideogames> Yeah
[1:45:39] <%DappercatEsquire> Okay, but what if the gun mechanics of Receiver with the gameplay of Superhot?
[1:45:43] <Jp_DrZaius> Those white ones there are gonna be extra hard for blind pat
[1:45:44] <%Double_Tap_That> It was a game jam game
[1:45:45] <+techmech25> the browser game is still dope
[1:45:45] <dapperskeleton69> seems like the ai has some semblance of strategy, either that or it just kinda bumblefucks into good plays
[1:45:58] <+techmech25> @DappercatEsquire sounds like a nightmare
[1:46:02] <%sexdrugsvideogames> Focus Mode?
[1:46:13] <%heartlesshealer> that lean dodge
[1:46:17] <%Typhaeon> Pat Doesn't Lead At Kappa
[1:46:21] <%Treuan> Feetman
[1:46:34] <%Double_Tap_That> @dappercatesquire SUPERHOT X Receiver would be awesome
[1:46:37] <%DappercatEsquire> @techmech25 Probably, but I could see it being really tense
[1:46:52] <CptVolkow> Hit the weakspot for massive damage
[1:46:58] <%Pilzkun> I think it's a fairly simple AI but good enemy spawn placement and timing
[1:47:02] <%lockhead45> Wait till we get to the armoured black evil enemies
[1:47:02] <%sexdrugsvideogames> Multiplayer tho
[1:47:06] <%Valdorick> and gunning

[1:47:50] <RedoctoberWolf> that serpentine movement saved him
[1:48:12] <%DappercatEsquire> No crouch in this game, I take it?
[1:48:12] <DSD24> I hope one of the levels is just called 'Stairs"
[1:48:38] <%sexdrugsvideogames> Impossible?
[1:48:42] <%lockhead45> @techmech25 Well I never got far enough to see if they exist as I was just joking but in my mind they would just need you to hit them twice to break off the armour and kill them.
[1:49:03] <Aydarkzero> huh
[1:49:03] <%twoto858> Does this game still have the hotswap mechanic?

[1:53:33] <%swesterly> Hey pat you gunna do a full DP2 Lp?
[1:53:44] <%Double_Tap_That> And it rotates with your camera, so looking at bullets as you dodge them makes them less likely to hit you.
[1:53:50] <MattyValor> because it's a game that supports VR, clearly designed for Pat
[1:53:55] <StrawberryBandit> wait you can deflect now? not just stop bullets

[2:10:37] <+DACH33ZMAN> its super ambiguous but yeah @BinaryFireball
[2:10:46] <%RyTYoung> @binaryfireball yes it's told very minimally tho
[2:10:49] <%Hegelundra> these replays really dont look as good as you expect them to, they dont actually look 1 to 1
[2:10:49] <%BinaryFireball> ah that's cool
[2:10:50] <%CommanderSqueaks> This is a dumb question, is this a full sequel?
[2:11:02] <%CommanderSqueaks> Or DLC?
[2:11:06] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> is it hot though?
[2:11:14] <%BinaryFireball> you hear that guys? I'm SOMEBODY

[2:11:26] <%Pyroclase> I think it's like, a big expand-alone
[2:11:32] <segychan> it seems like the replays trim out extra movement
[2:11:33] <+blaze__drag> to be fair the replays have to sort of smooth things out or they'd be a super jittery clusterfuck
[2:11:37] <%dekkitout> An action game with a weird and obscure stiyr? *No...?*
[2:11:46] <MrBleeeh> god i can never get over this game. its literally the best
[2:11:47] <%Hegelundra> it's kinda like a full sequel and a standalone dlc kinda kinda
[2:12:00] <%nimu290> psaUp
[2:12:05] <%CommanderSqueaks> So it is at least Standalone, okay.

[2:20:48] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Katana is Japanese for a sword called a Katana which is a Japanese sword called a Katana but its nto called a Katana because its a Japanese sword but rather that it is a sword in Japanese that represents a Japanese sword called a Katana

[2:33:06] <1BeatGames> At first I was so confused because you weren't playing this with a VR Set, but this isn't the same game üòÖ

[2:33:50] <+DACH33ZMAN> ohhh
[2:34:04] <chaumiester> What if he has a Red Penis? What then
[2:34:11] <%CommanderSqueaks> The fact that most of these fights involve you just wildly throwing household items at people until they die is hilarious
[2:34:17] <MattyValor> I mean
[2:34:23] <1BeatGames> @chaumiester Shoot him in it
[2:34:32] <%CommanderSqueaks> He got screwed
[2:34:36] <MattyValor> I don't think you can normally highjack a penis
[2:34:41] <VanLynx> Super and Hot until it is done
[2:34:50] <%tigerfang86> FISH
[2:34:59] <huskarl_zap> YOOOOOOOOOOOO

[2:35:14] <%Pyroclase> That is the weirdest water texture I've ever seen in my life
[2:35:30] <%CommanderSqueaks> Are these dead fish or are you moving so fast that you're grabbing live fish out of the water with your bare hands?
[2:35:30] <BunnyEmperor> LUL for a second I thought this was a glitch but it's supposed to be water
[2:35:37] <unclerizla> Ooooh so this gets a VR release too right ??
[2:35:38] <chaumiester> @MattyValor Not with that attitude
[2:35:42] <%tigerfang86> @CommanderSqueaks yes
[2:35:48] <+techmech25> @unclerizla nope
[2:35:52] <RedoctoberWolf> BUTTERKNIFE
[2:35:55] <%SvenHolgersson> 5 ACROSS THE FACE
[2:36:12] <unclerizla> @techmech25 whyyyy, its the best vr game. And I need mooore
[2:36:14] <%CommanderSqueaks> Aw, I was hoping you'd win the level with just the butter knife
[2:36:41] <%CommanderSqueaks> So you ARE instant transmissioning.
[2:36:48] <%tigerfang86> HEADSHOT
[2:36:55] <%CommanderSqueaks> Since if you were just going fast you'd still get shot.
[2:37:19] <%TheBitingIrish> Oh shit, you can use the double barrel as a club?
[2:37:20] <Kiaayo> that's not what an easel is bu tok
[2:37:23] <%tigerfang86> I bet it's like, plexiglass
[2:37:32] <%dukenux> Happy little murders
[2:37:32] <BunnyEmperor> I thought that was a CD LUL
[2:37:38] <sougoe> Bob Ross would be proud
[2:37:41] <%CommanderSqueaks> EASEL
[2:37:41] <%tigerfang86> YEYEYEYEYE
[2:37:42] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> jesus, that palette fucked that dude
[2:37:42] <%XeroSigmaPrime> So rather than moving fast, hes Wesker style teleporting
[2:37:45] <%tigerfang86> YEEEEEE
[2:37:48] <%TheBitingIrish> That's a palette, pat
[2:37:55] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat that's not an Easel, that's a Palette.
[2:38:00] <SchlongKongEduardo> atpCap

[2:38:20] <%BubbaRands> @sougoe dammit y BEAT me to it LUL
[2:38:31] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat isn't creative, remember guys. He doesn't know how art works.
[2:38:49] <keatiestofthegribbles> is this a scene from uncut gems?
[2:38:55] <huskarl_zap> JEEDAI TRICKS
[2:39:01] <MattyValor> then he'd be a perfect Bob Ross student
[2:39:12] <SchlongKongEduardo> ooh

[2:39:19] <%SirGO0SE> woah :O
[2:39:23] <chaumiester> You know what else is super hot? Your balls Pat. Lets those boys breath bud
[2:39:34] <%CommanderSqueaks> I feel like if Pat tried to draw, he'd spend 10 hours obsessing over the fact that a certain line wasn't perfectly straight and then just burn the whole painting.
[2:39:41] <cactusdt> 33333336535
[2:39:55] <BunnyEmperor> punched in the dick
[2:40:05] <StrawberryBandit> good one

[2:40:19] <%tigerfang86> AND TWIST IT
[2:40:24] <%maskofmichael> now its a death cup
[2:40:24] <elicoy> @CommanderSqueaks Sounds right. He should stream it anyway
[2:40:24] <StrawberryBandit> h-he's fast
[2:40:28] <%CommanderSqueaks> Okay, real talk, metal credit cards I could totally see being lethal if you threw it hard enough.

[2:40:56] <+LunarDensetsu> FLCL NICE
[2:40:57] <%CommanderSqueaks> You do not put dressing on a steak, you marinade a steak, dressing is for salad.
[2:41:07] <%CommanderSqueaks> People who put dressing on steak are monsters.
[2:41:11] <+LunarDensetsu> Wind God Fist
[2:41:15] <MattyValor> those cards are made for more than scanning
[2:41:25] <%GeneralSCPatton> If Pat drew, he would just end up converting blank paper into graph paper, because it is made of squares and is therefore perfect.
[2:41:25] <%CommanderSqueaks> LUL
[2:41:38] <BunnyEmperor> I'm guessing you can't dash all the time?
[2:41:39] <%CommanderSqueaks> That's totally what would happen
[2:41:50] <MattyValor> speaking of steak
[2:41:52] <%CommanderSqueaks> When does Pat unlock summon swords?
[2:41:52] <%BubbaRands> @CommanderSqueaks Nothing like drizzling RANCH on my prime rib 4Head
[2:42:03] <%CommanderSqueaks> @BubbaRands You're a monster.

[2:43:39] <%WhereIsWill> Dijon and stone ground mustard is the truth
[2:43:39] <elicoy> French's mustard even
[2:43:49] <Jack8274> Why is Pat playing the one game which works better with a CONTROLLER?
[2:43:53] <Jack8274> WITH A KB A M
[2:44:04] <Jack8274> Otherwise always never uses it lol

[2:58:03] <%CommanderSqueaks> SCUM
[2:58:26] <%weissguard> Might. Controls. E V E R Y T H I N G.
[2:58:36] <%CommanderSqueaks> Okay, the first Super Hot was great, but like I'm having as much fun watching this game as I did PLAYING the original Super Hot.
[2:58:46] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> NOT THE LAWN DART
[2:58:51] <%tigerfang86> maybe
[2:58:52] <%optimasmaximas> yes
[2:58:54] <%tigerfang86> maybe........
[2:58:54] <%optimasmaximas> and nero
[2:58:57] <%Shadicara> Maybe
[2:59:01] <StrawberryBandit> super sexy sexy
[2:59:12] <Kazic5000> Sans the pizza and shit eating grins.
[2:59:13] <%Shadicara> Nah no suplex yet
[2:59:13] <%CommanderSqueaks> Hey, batman tried
[2:59:14] <%CommanderSqueaks> He tried
[2:59:22] <%indig0bird> Use shoe
[2:59:25] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Shadicara Yet
[2:59:28] <%LunarRemix> I don't think super upbeat music would fit this game
[2:59:34] <%LunarRemix> So I'd say no.
[2:59:34] <%maskofmichael> If this is Dante/Virgil, just imagine what it was like for Sparta
[2:59:37] <%chiazamformerlymankeyfigh> DANCE
[2:59:40] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> i feel like you can only do so much of this before it gets boring
[2:59:48] <StrawberryBandit> SourPls
[2:59:53] <%Shadicara> Nice try pat LUL
[3:00:01] <%doc_ock_rokc> @LunarRemix The how about depressing disco
[3:00:02] <%CommanderSqueaks> SourPls
[3:00:03] <%optimasmaximas> @maskofmichael dante and vergil are stronger than sparta
[3:00:05] <+Mottyrob> SLAP
[3:00:09] <%CommanderSqueaks> Of course this music would be Industrial.
[3:00:17] <%CommanderSqueaks> Why would it ever be anything, but Industrial.
[3:00:25] <TootPirate> SourPls
[3:00:25] <+DACH33ZMAN> @SaltkeyAndAckfish you'd think but I beat SUPER HOT 1 in one sitting cuz I was so into it lol
[3:00:26] <%optimasmaximas> nice pat
[3:00:26] <%Shadicara> LUL
[3:00:32] <Sol_Install> nice
[3:00:35] <1BeatGames> LUL
[3:00:36] <+worldbuildwithus> Resurrect the Doom Music meme
[3:00:38] <%maskofmichael> @optimasmaximas But are they faster?
[3:00:41] <Kazic5000> Knowing is half the battle.
[3:00:47] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> @DACH33ZMAN how long is it?
[3:00:54] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat it sounds like Doom music because you literally only ever listen to video game and anime music.
[3:00:58] <%nimu290> nedm
[3:01:00] <%CommanderSqueaks> And musicals, when Peach forces you.
[3:01:13] <madskull456> Knowledge is power *throws book*
[3:01:13] <1BeatGames> Unintentionally got the guy behind the one you shot
[3:01:25] <%optimasmaximas> @maskofmichael i assume so, but i also think nero would be faster considering the way that universe works
[3:01:29] <+DACH33ZMAN> @SaltkeyAndAckfish if you dont do the challenges and the extra content its like a 5-7 hour game
[3:01:39] <%optimasmaximas> @maskofmichael lol, imagine doing the intro for dmc 5 in this
[3:02:04] <%CommanderSqueaks> I mean, in DMC you're pretty much doing this without the slowdown.
[3:02:17] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> @DACH33ZMAN are the challenages achievements you get for doing certain things in the regular levels, or dedicated levels?
[3:02:36] <Kazic5000> There's a speedrun mode where you pretty much play without the slowdown.
[3:02:43] <%CommanderSqueaks> This entire game is just in Dante Must Die mode.
[3:02:54] <Kazic5000> Ded
[3:02:55] <%Shadicara> LUL
[3:02:58] <%superc37> NICE
[3:03:00] <%tigerfang86> lol
[3:03:03] <%CommanderSqueaks> Actually, Heaven or Hell, to be more specific.
[3:03:07] <%GelatinBoi> LUL
[3:03:10] <StrawberryBandit> love how you can sometimes see your death coming but nothing you can do about it
[3:03:12] <%Shadicara> You definitely eat shit like dante pat Kappa
[3:03:20] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> wait what, how far back does it set you?
[3:03:30] <%MelBrooksKA> I assume you lose your hacks if you die?
[3:03:34] <%CommanderSqueaks> @SaltkeyAndAckfish Start of the level group.
[3:03:41] <+JustToWatch> so apparently DP2 is going to get some scenes rewritten
[3:03:45] <Run44forrest> wtf is that gun
[3:03:47] <+DACH33ZMAN> @SaltkeyAndAckfish iirc both.
[3:03:53] <%M3djedx> Man this looks so dank
[3:03:59] <%lockhead45> He hasn't even gotten to the hard levels yet, this game is super BS and only gets more so
[3:04:06] <%CommanderSqueaks> @JustToWatch Rewritten? Cause of the racism?
[3:04:08] <%superc37> @justtowatch really? how so?
[3:04:10] <Run44forrest> what why @justtowatch
[3:04:41] <%superc37> i imagine its cuz of the transphobia but im curious as to what extent
[3:04:51] <Kazic5000> Home run!
[3:04:52] <Ipsenscastle> be patient my dude
[3:04:56] <+JustToWatch> Because the shitty stuff regarding a trans character ***
[3:05:06] <Kazic5000> Well then be cooler.
[3:05:17] <StrawberryBandit> damn that gun is fast
[3:05:38] <%doc_ock_rokc> GORDAN FREEMAN IS ANGRY YOU BROKE A CROWBAR
[3:05:46] <%superc37> @justtowatch ... so are they fixing it or what? do you have a link to where they said theyre gonna change it?
[3:05:56] <%CommanderSqueaks> Is it just with the localization or is it present in Japanese, too? Considering SWERY made The Missing, I would figure he'd be pretty cognizant to not put any unintentional transphobia in the game.
[3:05:57] <Kazic5000> Inject him with the drugs
[3:05:58] <%tigerfang86> THE MYSTERY SYRINGE
[3:06:01] <%tigerfang86> WHAT'S IN IT
[3:06:11] <StrawberryBandit> jesus
[3:06:21] <+JustToWatch> the link I included was a tweet from Swery
[3:06:23] <+DACH33ZMAN> holy shit this level is a cluster fuck lol
[3:06:31] <Kazic5000> Do you only have to kill a certain percent of the enemy?
[3:06:31] <Run44forrest> cant wait for people to pretend to care and throw a fit over it
[3:06:38] <%tigerfang86> oh GOD
[3:06:39] <+mckraven> throwing the gun and dashing is the coolest
[3:06:42] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> @tigerfang86 mysterious liquid Kappa
[3:06:50] <%CommanderSqueaks> Get Jokered.
[3:06:51] <%doc_ock_rokc> I once saw himkill a man with a PENCIL
[3:07:01] <%doc_ock_rokc> A FUCKING PENCIL
[3:07:12] <1BeatGames> Call Of Duty: SHOOT A MAN
[3:07:32] <%superc37> @commandersqueaks givin how the transphobia is kinda ingrained in the plot, i think it was just unintentional dickery on his end.
[3:07:36] <%Shadicara> Literal Art Attack

[3:08:08] <%tigerfang86> NUUUUU
[3:08:08] <+DACH33ZMAN> RIP
[3:08:08] <%lockhead45> @CommanderSqueaks Its super dumb tbh they are mad that the super mega weirdo York doesn't use the proper name or pronoun at every time
[3:08:17] <%Shadicara> Tried to be too cool
[3:08:19] <%Typhaeon> Get turned into a Cockney orphan
[3:08:21] <%Jeemukun> why did you turn into clemps there
[3:08:30] <%Razputin217> You hate to see it
[3:08:40] <%ssjklyco> Feet
[3:08:42] <+DACH33ZMAN> its brutal that you can potentially have to reply 4 levels after you die
[3:08:45] <%walternatorz> it's spreading
[3:08:50] <%Shadicara> Rename to PatClempsAt
[3:08:50] <%tigerfang86> ok but now I want to see clemps even try to play this game
[3:08:53] <%CommanderSqueaks> @lockhead45 I mean it'd be different if someone called him out or corrected him, since pretty much everyone in DP2 is more than willing to call York out on his strange bullshit.
[3:08:54] <%tigerfang86> it'd be hilarious
[3:09:02] <1BeatGames> I swear there's something magical about watching Pat live as apposed to watching the vods on YouTube
[3:09:05] <%doc_ock_rokc> hes pat
[3:09:24] <%shurtal> Have YOU ever seen clemps and pat in the same place!?!?! (ignore that one stream.....and those conventions....)
[3:09:24] <Jackabyte> Pat is best
[3:09:28] <1BeatGames> That he is
[3:09:34] <+DACH33ZMAN> baseball bat> cinderblock
[3:09:35] <%doc_ock_rokc> @1BeatGames is it us?
[3:09:43] <%superc37> @lockhead45 you realize the transphobia happens after york goes on a big rant about how trans people should be treated as people right, thus making his deadnaming of the character all the more insulting
[3:09:46] <%CommanderSqueaks> @lockhead45 Also, considering SWERY made an entire game covering the difficulties and pain of being transgender, I'm sure he'd want to correct it once he caught on regardless whether or not he got called out on it.
[3:09:57] <+meatmaaan> we were the super hot all along
[3:10:09] <%chainedwolfstress> Thanks for the PrideDragon @mrllamashark
[3:10:10] <%MelBrooksKA> What can you deflect bullets with?
[3:10:26] <1BeatGames> @doc_ock_rokc I think it is
[3:10:38] <%tigerfang86> WHOAAAA
[3:10:39] <+DACH33ZMAN> yooooo
[3:10:45] <+DACH33ZMAN> some matrix shit right there
[3:10:49] <Jackabyte> Close call
[3:10:55] <TioXyco> that was TOO CLOSEfor confort
[3:11:02] <%CommanderSqueaks> Also, if it's a non-voice-acted line, all it takes is a small rewrite an a patch to fix.
[3:11:04] <+Mugen4552> Nice
[3:11:20] <+meatmaaan> butt wrench
[3:11:21] <%CommanderSqueaks> Yes, Pat, that is a wrench.
[3:11:24] <%WhereIsWill> this game is how itd feel to fight an actual vampire LUL
[3:11:27] <+DACH33ZMAN> katana is top tier
[3:11:27] <%superc37> the problem isnt just that shes deadnamed tho, theres a bunch of other shit that i cant get into cuz of spoilers that feed into to REALLY harmful stereotypes about trans people
[3:11:44] <%doc_ock_rokc> Just sit right there
[3:11:47] <%tigerfang86> SICK
[3:11:50] <%superc37> @commandersqueaks oh no its voice acted
[3:11:57] <Kazic5000> SUPER DISCO
[3:12:00] <+meatmaaan> big arms
[3:12:07] <%WhereIsWill> disco best stage
[3:12:09] <+mundanelotus> That was hot
[3:12:09] <%doc_ock_rokc> And I'm gonna tell you all about how I became the prince of bellair
[3:12:13] <%SirGO0SE> SourPls
[3:12:14] <%CommanderSqueaks> Well, I mean not to be mean, but I don't think the VO for York is SWAMPED with work... So I mean probably wouldn't be too hard to get him back in the studio.
[3:12:27] <+DACH33ZMAN> now this is actually John Wick
[3:12:32] <%CommanderSqueaks> Or to rerecord from his home studio.
[3:12:34] <%BlkFlameKami> SourPls
[3:12:42] <+Prism_Wing> Is that the Zardonic logo???
[3:13:11] <%Rabbi_Hyman_Krustofsky> It's like The Matrix, but bad
[3:13:14] <Kazic5000> Deflecting like 8 shotgun pellets is wacko.
[3:13:23] <%WhereIsWill> sweep. the leg.
[3:13:23] <%CommanderSqueaks> All things considered, considering how things are in Japan, the fact that a Japanese developer is even TRYING to do the subject matter justice is commendable.
[3:13:40] <%Midashu> music is by DJ Zardonic, so yeah... it is.
[3:13:53] <sonofslann> @commandersqueaks wait what happened
[3:13:55] <%lockhead45> Did you just do a chop on his head?
[3:14:04] <Kazic5000> Briefcase! POCKET SAND!
[3:14:07] <+Prism_Wing> @midashu Thanks :)
[3:14:21] <%LunarDensetsu> psaBig
[3:14:25] <%WhereIsWill> pocket sand in this would be dope
[3:14:28] <+DACH33ZMAN> is that a plastic knife LUL
[3:14:34] <%CommanderSqueaks> @sonofslann SWERY made an announcement that there's going to be a scene rewrite in DP2 because they unintentionally fumbled how they handled a transgendered character.
[3:14:36] <%Typhaeon> Think I'll wait to actually see the scene in question.
[3:14:38] <%Jeemukun> as you do
[3:14:39] <BoneofMalkav> "Super Hot but all the guns are replaced by Walkie Talkies"
[3:14:40] <%doc_ock_rokc> Plastic knifes
[3:14:40] <Kazic5000> The UK police were right! They're deadly weapons!
[3:14:40] <%superc37> @commandersqueaks what gets me is that he already DID it better in The Missing. which just makes the shit in dp2... extremely confusing
[3:14:41] <+meatmaaan> get forked
[3:14:41] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> You saying they toast?
[3:14:43] <%WhereIsWill> fork in torso sounds awful
[3:14:45] <%doc_ock_rokc> ALSO HOW DID THEY GET A GUN
[3:14:47] <%LunarDensetsu> LunarDensetsu subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! psaBig psaBig
[3:14:49] <SpaceLTN> gamer pose
[3:14:55] <%superc37> almost like it was written by a different writer
[3:14:57] <Jackabyte> SUB
[3:15:04] <%lockhead45> Maybe because DP2 is set in the south?
[3:15:18] <%superc37> or that the character was written by a version of him from 10 years ago
[3:15:35] <%Typhaeon> What is the context - is the character doing this supposed to be villainous, insensitive or a dumbass? Need to see that first
[3:15:41] <%CommanderSqueaks> @superc37 SWERY also had several transgender individuals and mental health specialists who specialized in therapy for transgender individuals to advise him while he made The Missing.
[3:15:42] <%superc37> @lockhead45 then why does york deadname them as well
[3:15:57] <%lockhead45> Because York is crazy
[3:15:59] <%JumboCrunchies> Does this game show you what your whole scene looks like when you're done?
[3:16:03] <%Typhaeon> For York I'd say "oblivious" applies
[3:16:09] <%superc37> @lockhead45 also if you played the game youd know the problem is WAY more than just deadnaming
[3:16:23] <%superc37> @commandersqueaks okay yeah that explains it
[3:16:54] <%CommanderSqueaks> So he's TRYING, boy is he trying, he's just not 100% there yet.
[3:16:56] <%tigerfang86> FINAL
[3:16:59] <Kazic5000> You got it I believe in you!
[3:16:59] <%Typhaeon> Last one at least
[3:17:01] <+DACH33ZMAN> dont choke :)
[3:17:13] <+DACH33ZMAN> USE THE DINO
[3:17:14] <%Typhaeon> Is this just a series of randomizers or was there a campaign add on I missed
[3:17:27] <Kazic5000> Fug
[3:17:30] <%Typhaeon> Ouch
[3:17:30] <+DACH33ZMAN> </3
[3:17:31] <reonome> gamer rage
[3:17:35] <$sniffy77> Daaaaaamn
[3:17:36] <+DACH33ZMAN> that is so fucking brutal
[3:17:43] <rbakervv> @Typhaeon entirenew game
[3:17:44] <%tigerfang86> game HARD
[3:17:46] <%tigerfang86> TOO HARD GAME
[3:17:48] <%SirGO0SE> LUL
[3:17:58] <hairtoday> HEATED GAMER MOMENT
[3:18:02] <%SirGO0SE> oh shit new woolie emotes woolieSPICE woolieKICKDAD woolieMIHNMAX woolieONEGUY
[3:18:05] <sonofslann> Weren‚Äôt there trans issues in the first game because they made the trans person a serial killer i might be misremembering
[3:18:05] <%superc37> @commandersqueaks for sure. the fact that hes even going back to fix it is something you wouldnt see from near any other dev (cough cpugh druckmann)
[3:18:08] <+DACH33ZMAN> that was sick using the ash tray to block the bullets
[3:18:14] <%CommanderSqueaks> There's also the fact that English is not SWERY's native language, and he's not especially strong in it, so he's really dependent on his localization team to help him.
[3:18:14] <%Typhaeon> @rbakervv Yes but it's just a dungeon with randomized levels at this point, like a DLC almost.
[3:18:19] <%lockhead45> Yeah I wouldn't recommend trying to smash all of this in one go unless you want to smash up your rig
[3:18:22] <%tigerfang86> psa1guy woolieONEGUY
[3:18:29] <Helmed> are videogames too videogamey? dark souls without an easy mode is a failure of game design
[3:18:40] <%SirGO0SE> psa1guy woolieONEGUY combo is strong
[3:18:55] <%tigerfang86> it is
[3:18:56] <%superc37> @sonofslann well yeah but that was like a decade ago and after the missing, it was p much assumed that hed gotten better with that sort of stuff
[3:18:58] <%CommanderSqueaks> So if you have a localization team that's not experienced with handling transgender characters, there's definitely the likelihood of them stumbling over their ass on it.
[3:19:05] <+meatmaaan> I wish games would just play themselves
[3:19:07] <%tigerfang86> maybe woolieONEGUY psa1guy
[3:19:32] <%SirGO0SE> its like a big neon sign and hes being kicked out
[3:19:38] <%SirGO0SE> A+
[3:19:52] <%tigerfang86> oh SHIT
[3:19:56] <%Typhaeon> He's being kicked out of his own bar?
[3:20:03] <%superc37> @commandersqueaks there is also the fact that the characters motives and backstory is rooted in transphobic tropes, something i dont see as an easy fix
[3:20:09] <rbakervv> @Typhaeon it's a full game, ***
[3:20:18] <+DACH33ZMAN> if only you could dual wield katanas
[3:20:31] <%Typhaeon> @rbakervv You are not actually listening to anything I'm saying.
[3:20:58] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Pat is a Ninja Turtle, confirmed.
[3:21:09] <%CommanderSqueaks> @superc37 Also, even though he's taking full responsibility, there's also a possibility that he didn't even handle the majority of the writing for that particular scene and it could have just flown under his radar. I have a sneaking suspicion DP2 didn't have the best time management in its development cycle.
[3:21:25] <%SirGO0SE> Patkatana will make u his bitch
[3:21:36] <%tigerfang86> DAMN
[3:21:40] <%rufus2k2> can you grab glass?

[3:22:05] <+meatmaaan> hot
[3:22:11] <%Typhaeon> Hey, since there's an actual LP of DP2 ongoing on t his channel, maybe we can agonize over all of this when it actually comes up.
[3:22:16] <%CommanderSqueaks> I'm willing to give SWERY the benefit of a the doubt on this one.

[3:25:19] <%lockhead45> @Samaugsch2 Super fuckign boring
[3:25:21] <%CommanderSqueaks> Wait, Pat actually got Blocked by TLOU2 Twitter? That's the best. They gave him a code and then blocked him with he didn't like the game.
[3:25:33] <jimmytwofeet> PATRICK MY LOVE
[3:25:37] <Shwepie> @Samaugsch2 He was bored and hated the characterization of everyone.
[3:25:44] <CursedNobleman> LUL
[3:25:45] <%lockhead45> Sony has been super scummy about TLoU2
[3:25:57] <KnightAsteran> wait why did the other dude blow up?
[3:26:00] <%Pappajimbo> he did say dmca deez nuts
[3:26:02] <%Shockrates20XX> Are the levels procedurally generated?
[3:26:14] <Kazic5000> @Shockrates20XX No
[3:26:20] <%Alpha8087> Oh shit is this the new addon to Super Hot?
[3:26:29] <+meatmaaan> the tlou2 discussion is super toxic on both ends
[3:26:30] <Winner_92> ok the katana slicing bullets back at enemies is so dumb but also cool as fuck this game rules
[3:26:32] <Kazic5000> But I think you start in various places throughout them.
[3:26:35] <%CommanderSqueaks> Wait, wasn't Pat playing this with a controller earlier? When did he switch?
[3:26:51] <OldManDeckardCain> imagine removing a lot of negatice metacritic user reviews and leaving all of the clearly fake positive reviews LUL

[3:27:19] <%lockhead45> I wouldn't want to even think about how you would play this on a controller that is just gross
[3:27:20] <%doc_ock_rokc> @OldManDeckardCain Like the THOUSANDS of duplicate reviews
[3:27:24] <%MelBrooksKA> @Winner_92 If I could move in the stopped time, I would totally deflect bullets with a k-tana
[3:27:32] <%WhereIsWill> was wondering what that 7 meant on the scren LUL
[3:27:47] <Ipsenscastle> the first one was fine on controller
[3:28:00] <%CommanderSqueaks> Honestly, if I could stop time, I would just do it to stop myself from bumbling and dropping shit all the time, that's it.
[3:28:01] <Kazic5000> @lockhead45 With your hands, theoretically.
[3:28:11] <%tigerfang86> I didn't see a 7
[3:28:12] <Ipsenscastle> it's like the best FPS to use controller on anyway surely, you have all the time in the world to line up shots
[3:28:17] <+mundanelotus> sick moves

[3:28:50] <Ipsenscastle> nice job orbo
[3:28:51] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat just took that right in his dick
[3:28:53] <Khorneflakes_> PepeHands old man reflexes
[3:28:54] <%Midashu> so focused on deflecting the bullet, pat didn't even bother to dodge
[3:28:57] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> git good
[3:29:03] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat how does it feel to tank a bullet with your groin?
[3:29:07] <Hoanui> when you picked up a slot machine lever
[3:29:20] <%spiritofmojave> Dickface tanking
[3:29:30] <%CommanderSqueaks> Imagine if you shot someone in the dick and they just took it? I'd give up right then and there.
[3:29:34] <+meatmaaan> would you rather take a bullet to the dick or the balls tho
[3:29:36] <%WhereIsWill> its been 84 years
[3:29:44] <%CommanderSqueaks> Balls.
[3:29:44] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> I wish I had a bulletproof dick
[3:29:48] <%CommanderSqueaks> I only need one.
[3:30:10] <Run44forrest> ill just get a dick transplant
[3:30:11] <Kazic5000> Does throwing your sword break it?
[3:30:19] <TioXyco> every dick is bullet proof as long as bullet doesn't ht your dick
[3:30:19] <%WhereIsWill> how do YOU know its not bulletproof?
[3:30:24] <%Midashu> you just need to get your dick SUPER hard
[3:30:26] <%tigerfang86> someday we'll get cyborg dicks
[3:30:31] <%Joustar_> yours isn't?
[3:30:32] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> I'll get kevlar implants or somtething
[3:30:33] <%tigerfang86> made of titanium or something
[3:30:35] <+sixcubit> time for some dick transhumanism
[3:30:39] <%CommanderSqueaks> Not until we get cyborg dicks.
[3:30:40] <Kazic5000> Shoot your dick to increase it's bullet resistance.
[3:30:41] <%dekkitout> Well I want that cookie to be reinforced with adamantine
[3:30:45] <Ipsenscastle> until proven otherwise mine is absolutely bulletproof
[3:30:47] <Mr000Penguin> you DON'T have a bulletproof dick?
[3:30:50] <KnightAsteran> just coat your dick in Haki
[3:30:52] <+meatmaaan> usb dick slot
[3:30:55] <wix964> just need to tuck it inside yourself
[3:31:02] <Winner_92> bulletproof is now an option for penises in cyberpunk 2077
[3:31:05] <%CommanderSqueaks> If you're dick is small enough, does it make it functionally bullet proof?
[3:31:09] <%Joustar_> Bulletproof condoms?
[3:31:12] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> I guess it's time to go full chrome
[3:31:15] <Run44forrest> what if you get shot with a dickproof bullet ?

[3:32:06] <ikantreeed> @PatStaresAt Ayo, this game came out a while ago no? why are they sponsering u now? a new dlc??
[3:32:08] <Kazic5000> Why does the other guy's head explode when you kill the 7th? Is that a hack?

[3:33:53] <wix964> I guarantee we will get a sidequest in cyberpunk about someone having trouble with their dick enhancement
[3:34:00] <KnightAsteran> I mean like making you push rope midway through the act
[3:34:08] <Run44forrest> OP
[3:34:13] <c4g_> society has progressed past the need for aiming
[3:34:16] <%dekkitout> Yeah, pretty sure that's a thing
[3:34:18] <%goatbait> Just a happy little ricochet
[3:34:22] <%CommanderSqueaks> Why are you aiming Pat? There's no point anymore.
[3:34:37] <Floofiie> hard t?
[3:34:40] <Kazic5000> HER SPIKE
[3:34:40] <%Midashu> don't punch that guy

[3:34:49] <%lockhead45> Oh yeah these guys
[3:34:49] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Beer goggles wearing off will make you push rope halfway through
[3:34:50] <%Midashu> why so spiky
[3:34:50] <reonome> ouch
[3:34:51] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> spiky boy
[3:34:51] <%tigerfang86> PUNCHING IS DEADLY

[3:34:59] <%BallerSwagBro9k> SPIKEY BOI
[3:35:00] <+fingalights> Don't punch the Spikes?
[3:35:00] <TioXyco> they hurt when you punch?
[3:35:00] <%warmnoid> no mindless ora now
[3:35:01] <%Typhaeon> but he punch though
[3:35:04] <%CommanderSqueaks> Why would you melee the Spikey Joe?
[3:35:08] <%lockhead45> Try not to melee the spikes
[3:35:08] <%Rabbi_Hyman_Krustofsky> How can she slap
[3:35:10] <%Midashu> yeah pat punched him
[3:35:13] <%AncelDeLambert> did he lose a heart, or did throwing something stop that from happening?
[3:35:16] <%tigerfang86> noooo not the untextured water
[3:35:17] <Winner_92> wait but he did punch and no hurt???
[3:35:17] <%Joustar_> but will he punch if hurt?
[3:35:23] <%Deadpal> he punched him in not the spikey bit @Midashu
[3:35:24] <BoneofMalkav> Kick, Punch, Mind, Find
[3:35:24] <%tigerfang86> oh GOD
[3:35:27] <%tigerfang86> oh GOOOOOD
[3:35:27] <%Typhaeon> Sick
[3:35:28] <Kazic5000> Oh my god shotgun so hott
[3:35:29] <%CommanderSqueaks> Do the upgrades you get from the Squares at the beginning of the stage group permanent?
[3:35:34] <TioXyco> Pat became Revolver Ocelot
[3:35:35] <Floofiie> on GOD
[3:35:37] <KnightAsteran> christ its BL2 Gaige all over again
[3:35:37] <%Zombrocom> What even is aiming
[3:35:38] <%AncelDeLambert> that's what I'm assuming happened
[3:35:39] <+meatmaaan> fist spikes
[3:35:40] <TioXyco> but with every gun
[3:36:23] <Huntercd> We John Wick?
[3:36:29] <%Typhaeon> Oh shit they ricochet out
[3:36:37] <%tigerfang86> FRAG DUDES
[3:36:39] <%tigerfang86> I see
[3:36:50] <%BallerSwagBro9k> MAKE THEM EAT GLUTEN
[3:37:01] <%BallerSwagBro9k> EXPLODE THEIR DICK
[3:37:03] <TioXyco> so the spikes is teh direction of the frags flying?
[3:37:04] <Kazic5000> Charge and Katana is peak anime
[3:37:07] <%Midashu> spiky guys must be full of farts
[3:37:10] <%dekkitout> How long till a summon swords upgrade SeriousSloth
[3:37:25] <%Rabbi_Hyman_Krustofsky> Why are so many people intolerant of gluten? Gluten seems okay to me
[3:37:25] <reonome> YOOO
[3:37:26] <%tigerfang86> DANG
[3:37:28] <%CommanderSqueaks> Why do these guys keep aiming for your dick?
[3:37:29] <Ipsenscastle> the first was more of a puzzle thing
[3:37:33] <%CommanderSqueaks> That bullet was about to hit your dick, too.
[3:37:40] <%tigerfang86> hmmmm
[3:37:44] <Khorneflakes_> I do miss the mini-challange levels though, like stuck in an elevator with 3 people.
[3:37:45] <%Typhaeon> A little less of the weird, oppressive narrative than the first one had but you can really only do that once
[3:38:05] <%MelBrooksKA> First one relied a lot on gimicks too from what I remember, like "try to get down this hall without being hit by bullets"
[3:38:18] <Kazic5000> I wish there were more levels.
[3:38:25] <KnightAsteran> music is good
[3:38:29] <%BallerSwagBro9k> SourPls
[3:38:37] <c4g_> SourPls
[3:38:41] <%Typhaeon> Quake 2-esque soundtrack
[3:38:47] <%CommanderSqueaks> Since this level is more action oriented, it does mean they can get more mileage out of procedural generation since they don't have to rely on it being a tightly constructed puzzle for each level.

[3:45:39] <%CommanderSqueaks> Vr Chat conventions let's go.
[3:45:44] <%nimu290> oof
[3:45:46] <Winner_92> pat is crazy good at avoiding bullets when hes trying to die
[3:45:53] <Zbyrd0961> Its ok we can all go to disney world
[3:45:59] <Vyskus> hi Pat
[3:46:06] <+dmtjinni> git gud LUL
[3:46:09] <%nimu290> i wanted to go to comic this year
[3:46:11] <%Typhaeon> Conventions but with giant 3-dimensional pain jpg walls and massive dicks
[3:46:14] <1BeatGames> Okay but you dodged them good
[3:46:16] <$Teh_Un> SabaPing
[3:46:24] <%CommanderSqueaks> Disney World needs to be permanently shut down.
[3:46:27] <%Typhaeon> Not that much different from the real thing honestly
[3:46:44] <%Katashi25> Sanshee made that shirt years ago, but sadly discontinued it. TearGlove
[3:46:57] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Disney World needs to stay open permenantly so all the dumb people can die off.
[3:46:58] <1BeatGames> Where did this talk about dicks even come from?
[3:47:11] <%CommanderSqueaks> @King_Wolf_Rigger The problem is they bring their kids.
[3:47:31] <%Typhaeon> VRChat is the dick wellspring
[3:47:40] <%tigerfang86> gonna go with "extremely"
[3:47:40] <Hoanui> is that not just the pistol?
[3:47:41] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @CommanderSqueaks A WORTHY SACRIFICE
[3:47:42] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> Wow Pat! You're doing great! Nothing will stop this streak!
[3:47:48] <%Neryl_> @PatStaresAt It's a wiffle bat.
[3:47:48] <xbb1024> well you are moving abnormally fast
[3:47:49] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat you miss everytime you try to use the single shot pistol from any distance, what makes you think putting MORE distance between you and them would make you hit?
[3:47:49] <%MelBrooksKA> Hard enough to vaporize their heads
[3:47:52] <TioXyco> he's probably hitting the SUPER. HARD.
[3:48:11] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> NOICE HIT
[3:48:23] <%CommanderSqueaks> Okay, I just crazytalked myself
[3:48:30] <%CommanderSqueaks> Now he's not missing at all
[3:48:30] <$personmanthingg> This game makes you feel so smart
[3:48:37] <%possumwalsh1221> Speed run poggers
[3:48:42] <%dekkitout> Only a matter of time before this game ramps it up and adds ricochet bullets
[3:48:53] <%Typhaeon> Speargun with quickshot seems busted
[3:48:57] <%CommanderSqueaks> Why is he HITTING everything the moment I say he can't hit anything? Agh
[3:49:02] <%tigerfang86> y u s
[3:49:13] <+twig_blight> Anyone know when the next podcast is?
[3:49:29] <%pectusumbra> it's tomorrow
[3:49:29] <%nimu290> crazy talk is strong
[3:49:32] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> tomorrow at 1
[3:49:37] <%YakumoYomi> Thanks for the PrideCrown @cylish
[3:49:44] <xbb1024> is this new content?
[3:49:46] <%possumwalsh1221> Says he can‚Äôt hit anything, hits everything. He‚Äôs figured out how to use crazy talk for good oh no
[3:49:46] <%CommanderSqueaks> Crazy Talk is the strongest stand.
[3:49:47] <+VERDAXY> Is that a railgun?
[3:49:53] <SomersaultJustice> I guess that means paper mario is cancelled tomorrow :(
[3:49:58] <audrus> the real hotness is a paycheck
[3:50:11] <%BinaryFireball> he is not
[3:50:11] <%nimu290> it can effect chat now
[3:50:12] <%CommanderSqueaks> @SomersaultJustice Maybe not, Woolie is no stranger to doing two streams in one day.
[3:50:15] <%Daxalog> Everyone always going on about Super Hot. Can I just have some Might Cold? God damn.
[3:50:16] <%Deadpal> he's not streaming today
[3:50:16] <+DiabloDeAzul> He isn't
[3:50:22] <startstoprepeat> that'd depend if reggie can make it i assume
[3:50:23] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> No Pat, That would make sense
[3:50:25] <+Euphbugg> nope
[3:50:25] <%BallerSwagBro9k> He didn't
[3:50:29] <TioXyco> Crazy talk is so strong it affected even Max
[3:50:32] <%BallerSwagBro9k> And he never said why
[3:50:41] <%Nekros4442> I assume Reggie can't change his schedule on the fly like that
[3:50:44] <%pectusumbra> Afraid not. Probably has stuff going on
[3:50:49] <OldManDeckardCain> I can't believe pat cancelled paper mario before nintendo LUL
[3:50:49] <%Typhaeon> Nice all ranged build
[3:50:51] <%ElkRiverDog> ElkRiverDog subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months! So what are your thoughts on the oculus VR game that Carole Baskin made of her sanctuary?
[3:51:04] <%CommanderSqueaks> So we've gone from Vergil to Dante.
[3:51:07] <1BeatGames> Active dodging
[3:51:10] <Profmcstevie> RIP AND TEAR....slowly
[3:51:17] <+GreyManNoSpace> SourPls
[3:51:17] <SomersaultJustice> woolie's busy setting up onlyfans for his vtube persona I guess

[3:51:49] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat, why are you denying us the cool thing?
[3:51:51] <%possumwalsh1221> Just do the cool thing psaWhat
[3:51:52] <%SirGO0SE> psaFist psaPat
[3:51:53] <%Typhaeon> You need to watch the highly mediocre John Travolta movie of the same name I guess
[3:51:56] <%pectusumbra> It's because you litter. Admit it
[3:51:58] <+MrProw> WASH AWAY THE ANGER
[3:51:59] <%lockhead45> Yeah i think the first boss is soon
[3:52:00] <%Agami23> did you just "nothing personal" that man??
[3:52:01] <$sniffy77> Whats the deal with the spiky guy
[3:52:10] <%toastybites> Pat Cool (Final)
[3:52:16] <+spinalwizard> It's fine. Being shit at something is the first step to being less shit at it.
[3:52:18] <%CommanderSqueaks> I mean this game is just a super elaborate litter simulator,.
[3:52:21] <KaliasTV> I hear Pat's not cool now
[3:52:22] <c4g_> @sniffy77 explodes into a bunch of bullets when he dies
[3:52:24] <%nimu290> lol
[3:52:29] <%Daxalog> Bup
[3:52:32] <%CommanderSqueaks> LUL
[3:52:40] <audrus> channel york to keep your cool
[3:52:48] <Kazic5000> Haha knife go SPEEEN
[3:52:53] <%nimu290> watch him need it next time he doesnt pick it
[3:52:58] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> Why go fast when go slow is better? Be the Anti-Sonic
[3:53:02] <Hoanui> that was not fast move's fault
[3:53:12] <%CommanderSqueaks> Gotta go slow
[3:53:24] <startstoprepeat> pierce + ricochet is probably fun
[3:53:29] <BoneofMalkav> The knife makes me think of the antagonist of the movie Commando, Bennet.
[3:53:46] <%CommanderSqueaks> Oh god, Commando is the best.
[3:53:55] <%pectusumbra> Let off some steam, Patrick
[3:54:00] <%MelBrooksKA> What does More do?
[3:54:02] <1BeatGames> You just uppercut his head off
[3:54:14] <+spinalwizard> Remember when I said I'd kill you last?
[3:54:15] <%Typhaeon> That guy was the dorkiest villain
[3:54:22] <Kazic5000> UPPACUT THEM HOES
[3:54:25] <%pectusumbra> I'll always remember PyronFlax's dota guide where he references that
[3:54:29] <%CommanderSqueaks> I think Commando still has one of the best one-liner replies in any movie ever.
[3:54:40] <BoneofMalkav> ^
[3:54:44] <+MrProw> @pectusumbra Which one was it?
[3:54:49] <%ssjklyco> Cheating
[3:54:52] <SomersaultJustice> maybe he would cheat?
[3:54:54] <bleugh> the chainmail vest though
[3:54:57] <+spinalwizard> He was DEEP ottawa valley
[3:54:57] <+OnyxTyrant> I lied!
[3:55:00] <%dukenux> Every line Arnie has in Commando is a one-liner
[3:55:00] <BoneofMalkav> "Please don't disturb my friend. He's dead tired." LUL
[3:55:01] <+TDotGoat> Arnold S.
[3:55:12] <Kazic5000> Oops all grenades
[3:55:16] <%Typhaeon> You've heard of 3 ring binders, how about 8 bullet binders
[3:55:19] <Akett> You made throwables explosive!
[3:55:23] <%CommanderSqueaks> Like, it'd be one thing if he was jacked, but still had a gut, but he was just kinda flabby.
[3:55:25] <bleugh> Arnold S WutFace
[3:55:27] <%dukenux> >Pat in a chainmail wifebeater
[3:55:40] <%YakumoYomi> What a mansion!
[3:55:41] <%juxtest> I wonder if those projectiles would ricochet too
[3:55:57] <+MrProw> Did Pat try Superhot VR yet?
[3:55:57] <+meatmaaan> British pat would kidnap Alyssa milano
[3:56:06] <+MrProw> he probably did
[3:56:09] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> Auralnauts did an Arnold kill count a while ago and Commando was crazy
[3:56:24] <%CommanderSqueaks> Like if it was Armstrong vs Sig from FMA kinda deal, that'd be a bit more believable.
[3:56:33] <Kazic5000> Pat why must you destroy wiener?
[3:56:36] <%pectusumbra> @MrProw I don't remember off hand which one, but he talks about that line and how the scene doesn't make sense. "It's almost like Commando is a bad movie or something, but I digress"
[3:56:37] <%tigerfang86> JEEZ
[3:56:55] <Hoanui> I can't wait for Pat to get ricochet and a shotgun
[3:56:56] <%CommanderSqueaks> Dick succesfully protected from boolet.
[3:57:08] <%tigerfang86> its like paige and other women
[3:57:14] <%tigerfang86> pat just has to destroy penor
[3:57:17] <Profmcstevie> It's in the genes man
[3:57:27] <madskull456> pat must crush dong
[3:57:28] <SomersaultJustice> pat wants to be robocop
[3:57:32] <%CommanderSqueaks> He's the male version of Peach, that's why.
[3:57:33] <+meatmaaan> this reminds me of the classic robo cop dick shooting
[3:57:52] <%Emperor_Machinus> less competition
[3:58:01] <%Typhaeon> Good set of bonuses
[3:58:09] <audrus> guy exploded
[3:58:16] <%Pappajimbo> spiky man
[3:58:17] <%tigerfang86> the spike guy's bullets?
[3:58:19] <%CommanderSqueaks> Start with Gun, immediately throw gun after one shot.
[3:58:19] <+spinalwizard> sploder man
[3:58:20] <%SilvaChariot0133> spikeyboi
[3:58:26] <%CommanderSqueaks> Spikeyboy
[3:58:35] <Profmcstevie> Those spiked guys who you said explode upon death? He exploded upon death
[3:58:41] <%Typhaeon> Jesus
[3:58:43] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> The spiky people you said explode. You stood right next to one
[3:58:43] <%MelBrooksKA> Explode seems significantly less useful with only two lives
[3:58:43] <Aydarkzero> nice
[3:58:46] <%CommanderSqueaks> Okay that was kinda stylish.
[3:58:48] <DiscoDur0> HAWT
[3:59:00] <%CommanderSqueaks> Is Pat getting cool?

[4:00:54] <Profmcstevie> Folded maybe 3 times katanas
[4:01:06] <%BinaryFireball> @PatStaresAt what makes the best katana the best?
[4:01:07] <+meatmaaan> Did you know katana means Japanese sword
[4:01:12] <%Typhaeon> That is a very gooteckschamp move
[4:01:14] <%CommanderSqueaks> Dick shot dodged.
[4:01:15] <%BinaryFireball> how best is katanaanananana
[4:01:19] <+spinalwizard> I swear, I folded it at least twice
[4:01:37] <%CommanderSqueaks> This diegetic music is the fucking best.
[4:01:42] <audrus> plus you have to two hand it like a dick
[4:01:49] <%CommanderSqueaks> Diegetic music is one of those super specific things I always love seeing in video games.
[4:01:59] <%nimu290> he choose it

[4:03:10] <%pectusumbra> @MrProw I found it, it's the Nyx Assassin Guide by Pyrion Flax
[4:03:17] <%CommanderSqueaks> Maybe brief coffee break time? You kinda seem like you're hitting a wall.
[4:03:22] <+PolarBearPat> just got here. why are the levels ending before pat kills everyone? some people just explode?
[4:03:26] <+MrProw> @pectusumbra Aw, shit. Thanks broski. <3
[4:03:35] <%CommanderSqueaks> @PolarBearPat I think you just have to kill 7 per level.

[4:04:12] <%neroforte177> GENOCIDE RUN !!!
[4:04:17] <Profmcstevie> It's more interesting that way, not just a cleanup
[4:04:18] <%CommanderSqueaks> I wonder if that means if you dick around long enough if the level will just continually pumping out enemies?
[4:04:18] <%Daxalog> That "Gold" bar just shattered on that man
[4:04:24] <1BeatGames> Booooo kill them all
[4:04:47] <%CommanderSqueaks> The only problem with this level is that it makes me want to keep moving so the music keeps playing.
[4:05:06] <%Typhaeon> Chain charge with katana seems unstoppable

[4:14:53] <%walternatorz> play with your pinky out

[4:15:48] <%Th3SmartAlec> Gasp
[4:15:52] <SpaceLTN> SourPls
[4:15:53] <%JustYudha> The lack of audible music really makes this game feel slightly empty
[4:16:00] <%BubbaRands> OOOOOO
[4:16:07] <%Daxalog> Did the armored guys stop showing up because your not doing well?
[4:16:10] <%JustYudha> Oh nevermind it's just hidden lol

[4:16:17] <jeffishype> STYLISH
[4:16:18] <%BubbaRands> NOICE
[4:16:26] <%CommanderSqueaks> Considering how critical it is for you to be able to hear gunfire, I think it makes sense why there's limited music.
[4:16:26] <+Euphbugg> that was s faancy round
[4:16:32] <%BallerSwagBro9k> i wish every level had music tho
[4:16:37] <%Th3SmartAlec> SUPER. BIG-HARD.
[4:16:59] <super_robo_mg> Super big hard, just like Pat
[4:17:00] <c4g_> BIG hard monkaS
[4:17:06] <+spinalwizard> NO MUSIC IN THE STOPPED TIME!
[4:17:14] <%CommanderSqueaks> He was having a bad time
[4:17:19] <c4g_> lmao dude was freaking out
[4:17:26] <%PanicSwytch> Are there difficulty options? or just a spike as u progress
[4:17:33] <1BeatGames> You've been playing through levels with music though
[4:17:45] <%Th3SmartAlec> Kappa
[4:17:48] <%CommanderSqueaks> The only level that has music so far is the Disco level.
[4:18:12] <Kazic5000> Upgrade your mind software to lower difficulty.
[4:18:17] <+Dova573> man playing this game in vr is something else
[4:18:27] <%CommanderSqueaks> Git gud to lower the difficult.
[4:18:31] <%CommanderSqueaks> **difficulty
[4:18:57] <+SpaciousWheat> Git Smrt to type correctly
[4:19:17] <%Th3SmartAlec> OOF
[4:19:18] <%Cavumentum> Become as Hotline Miami
[4:19:23] <%CommanderSqueaks> But sup tho
[4:19:28] <%WhereIsWill> but what about the 3rd dick? sbfpSetIn sbfpSetIn
[4:19:28] <%heartlesshealer> yeah, super scary to melee those
[4:19:29] <chhdez> Dang, I missed most of the stream
[4:19:32] <Profmcstevie> One casual dick, one for formal events
[4:19:33] <+Dova573> is this a rogue like mode for superhot?
[4:19:43] <+AJCAR12> @PatStaresAt how much more content does this game have cause i remember SH1 being like 5 levels
[4:19:48] <%CommanderSqueaks> The formal dick is the same as the casual dick, it just has a tiny top hat.
[4:20:01] <%MelBrooksKA> super duper hot?
[4:20:03] <%GabeSweetMan> Thursday
[4:20:07] <+Dova573> Ohhhhh
[4:20:09] <@SoFarFetched> Thursday
[4:20:10] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Great plug!
[4:20:11] <+AWanderingKenku> Is there a story?
[4:20:13] <%Th3SmartAlec> Nothing personel kid
[4:20:15] <Profmcstevie> Wow, stuffed week
[4:20:15] <nipplestheenchilada96> what if you own the vr one?
[4:20:25] <@SoFarFetched> VR one won't get you this game for free
[4:20:29] <@SoFarFetched> needs to be the regular one.
[4:20:30] <eckskyuucow> Hey, Pat! Just got here after fucking shit up in Doom, how far are you in this?
[4:20:30] <Hoanui> I don't think this is quite a sequel
[4:20:37] <Ell1ot> How come the squeal wasn't called Super Duper Hot?
[4:20:38] <%BallerSwagBro9k> TELEPORT BEHIND YOU
[4:20:39] <%heartlesshealer> maybe they just wanted it to be cool and get it out there
[4:20:42] <%nimu290> they dont want the money on the table
[4:20:43] <reonome> its almost as if they care more about their customers than money!
[4:20:44] <%ssjklyco> Not if it gets people buying the original game just to get the free one
[4:20:45] <Kazic5000> @AWanderingKenku Yeah, but it's super weird and mostly unlocked through secrets.
[4:20:50] <%GabeSweetMan> It's a long term investment in customer loyalty.
[4:20:57] <nipplestheenchilada96> Super hot 2: Super hotter
[4:21:00] <%Th3SmartAlec> MY LEG
[4:21:00] <%BallerSwagBro9k> WE HATE MONEY LUL
[4:21:03] <Profmcstevie> Money is the source of so much pain, free games don't hurt nobody
[4:21:04] <HellishLancer> whateveer, free game for me
[4:21:12] <%Typhaeon> You deed eet
[4:21:14] <Kazic5000> @nipplestheenchilada96 LUL

[4:21:22] <+Dova573> Whats was that hand thing? the force?
[4:21:23] <+Euphbugg> yay
[4:21:24] <%CommanderSqueaks> Which is hilarious because David S of New Blood seems to have a REALLY nice house.
[4:21:27] <%Th3SmartAlec> Jebaited
[4:21:29] <%nimu290> more
[4:21:31] <%heartlesshealer> nodes forever =)
[4:21:33] <+AJCAR12> @PatStaresAt you only get it free if you buy the first one tho so any pre release sales they get just as much money cause people will buy the first one
[4:21:38] <%nimu290> always more
[4:21:44] <Profmcstevie> Fuck, more content bepLikeThis
[4:21:49] <%BubbaRands> IT NEVER ENDS PogChamp
[4:21:49] <+AJCAR12> then after release its irrelevant cause you cant get it free any more
[4:21:52] <%BallerSwagBro9k> UNLIMITED LEVELS WORKS
[4:21:59] <Kazic5000> And you were worried about beating it in one go.
[4:22:11] <audrus> more like 4 deez nuts
[4:22:14] <%MelBrooksKA> @CommanderSqueaks He hates money so much he threw it at a big house spyCappa
[4:22:22] <Railgun5> GET READY FOR HYPE
[4:22:26] <RetributionP> I thought that said BONE CORE
[4:22:35] <%heartlesshealer> oh boy
[4:22:37] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[4:22:43] <RetributionP> I wana listen to bone core
[4:22:44] <%CommanderSqueaks> @MelBrooksKA I wonder if he's like Tommy Wiseau and he made his money through questionably legitimate means, which means he doesn't need to make it from video games.
[4:22:49] <+Typhaeon> Well it worked Kappa
[4:22:50] <+Euphbugg> LUL
[4:22:55] <+dmtjinni> git gud LUL
[4:23:09] <%Maids4lyfe> is there a story or point to this game?
[4:23:11] <%MelBrooksKA> Fuck if I know
[4:23:26] <%heartlesshealer> nice
[4:23:28] <%CommanderSqueaks> The point is to be Super Hot.
[4:23:30] <+Arch7134> ZOOOM
[4:23:31] <+Dova573> That was a SHORYUKEN
[4:23:32] <TioXyco> this changes everything
[4:23:36] <%nimu290> better stinger
[4:23:38] <@SoFarFetched> Dig up Stupid
[4:23:40] <Kazic5000> @Maids4lyfe Yes, but it's super weird, and mostly unlocked through secrets.
[4:23:44] <%BubbaRands> UP
[4:23:54] <Profmcstevie> Gravity steps aside if you need to do something cool
[4:23:57] <%Maids4lyfe> I see, thanks
[4:24:15] <nipplestheenchilada96> Not sure if its a mechanic but if it is, i'm betting that pat kills himself with his own grenade
[4:24:23] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> butter up their poopers
[4:24:41] <%heartlesshealer> through waist height obstacles too
[4:24:45] <%CommanderSqueaks> Corpse Party, a classic.
[4:24:49] <%Pyroclase> I feel like greandes would take too long to detonate for this game, tbh
[4:25:04] <%TrebassTV> impact grenade
[4:25:18] <+Arch7134> SUPER
[4:25:19] <+Arch7134> THROW
[4:25:22] <%dekkitout> Super Yeet
[4:25:29] <%Pyroclase> niiiiiice
[4:25:37] <+Dova573> is this what having speedster powers feels like
[4:25:44] <Kazic5000> The world has become your weapon.
[4:25:46] <%GeneralSCPatton> Maybe if there was a remote grenade you could trigger with a button when aiming at it.
[4:25:52] <%CommanderSqueaks> This is how Vergil sees the world.
[4:25:53] <%SilvaChariot0133> TO BE CONTINUED
[4:26:03] <%CommanderSqueaks> An attempt was made
[4:26:04] <%heartlesshealer> enjoy health
[4:26:31] <nipplestheenchilada96> well one of the power ups he selected turns his thrown weapons into grenades
[4:26:35] <Kazic5000> @PatStaresAt You can jump on people's heads for insta kill.
[4:26:35] <+Arch7134> bless you
[4:26:38] <%GeneralSCPatton> How long until you unlock a Stand?
[4:26:39] <nipplestheenchilada96> it just explodes into bullets
[4:26:40] <+StrawberryPantsu> SUPER
[4:26:44] <%SomeSageAdvice> bless you
[4:26:49] <%nimu290> bless you
[4:26:52] <Profmcstevie> Does sneezing count as moving in the stopped time
[4:26:52] <Kazic5000> Yeah it's rad.
[4:26:54] <%toastybites> sounds like a lie
[4:27:02] <%CommanderSqueaks> Become as Mario
[4:27:13] <nipplestheenchilada96> wasn't that in the first game?
[4:27:14] <laserbeaming> you can just goomba stomp them? rad
[4:27:16] <+StrawberryPantsu> One Guy?
[4:27:22] <%ssjklyco> The game has not come out yet, how would you know that?
[4:27:28] <%GabeSweetMan> We must test it tho
[4:27:35] <%GeneralSCPatton> You have to unlock Mario's Bloodstained Boots of Genocide
[4:27:35] <%CommanderSqueaks> It sounds like a lie, but it also totally sounds like something this game would do.
[4:27:42] <%GabeSweetMan> doh
[4:27:47] <Kazic5000> That was in the first game. I assume they would keep it.
[4:27:49] <nipplestheenchilada96> ok self oof with grenades is a thing
[4:27:52] <%nimu290> someone called it
[4:27:52] <Mister_McDerp> oopsie
[4:27:53] <+Dova573> A lie is only a lie, until it becomes a truth Kappa
[4:27:56] <%DedlokPM> @ssjklyco Because it was purchaseable early access until somewhat recently
[4:27:56] <%CommanderSqueaks> pat pls
[4:27:59] <Railgun5> Goomba stomping got removed in this game, now it just stuns them instead of killing them
[4:28:00] <penitentpentwitch> That's not as useful
[4:28:02] <Profmcstevie> Bullets are unisex
[4:28:17] <Saltmeisterr> HOLY FUCK. i just had the most insane Gungeon run i have ever seen
[4:28:19] <%Cavumentum> This makes me want to play Shadow Warrior for some reason
[4:28:22] <Saltmeisterr> it was crazy
[4:28:26] <Kazic5000> @Profmcstevie I read that as buttsex is unisex.
[4:28:35] <%CommanderSqueaks> I mean
[4:28:38] <%ElkRiverDog> !uptime
[4:28:38] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 28m.
[4:28:43] <%CommanderSqueaks> That isn't an incorrect statement
[4:28:59] <Profmcstevie> He's wrong, but he is correct
[4:29:05] <Kazic5000> LUL
[4:29:28] <Railgun5> I can't wait for Pat to beat this level, he's going to be so happy
[4:29:46] <%CommanderSqueaks> It both upsets me and make me a little happy that less than 1k people will show up for those, but over 2k people will show up for DP2.

[4:36:12] <trfurkanrey18> !uptime
[4:36:12] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 36m.

[4:36:17] <%SirGO0SE> twitch being fucky wucky tonight
[4:36:30] <TioXyco> as usual
[4:36:34] <@SoFarFetched> @UrGuardianAnge1 he did like months ago,saying no more P5 cause not many views,plus all new content is like at the very end
[4:36:34] <%MelBrooksKA> Not that I've seen
[4:36:36] <%weissguard> UwU
[4:36:37] <+Arch7134> "just fucking end my life"
[4:36:40] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> I don't think Pat is gonna stream more P5

[4:36:56] <%SirGO0SE> i keep having to refresh uwu
[4:36:58] <penitentpentwitch> I assumed it was part of the promo. The stream repeated parts of you saying the same thing, like instant replay of the stream.
[4:37:07] <%Typhaeon> No fwamie wamies droppy woppied here
[4:37:07] <%UrGuardianAnge1> @SoFarFetched thanks
[4:37:08] <%CommanderSqueaks> I'm always afraid that saying UwU in chat will summon KirbySauce from the ether.
[4:37:27] <%BubbaRands> VINYL SHURIKEN
[4:37:30] <Kazic5000> They are.
[4:37:33] <Fro5tburn> SourPls
[4:37:33] <Ner234> I mean...
[4:37:34] <%WhereIsWill> he killed 84 ppl....with a vinyl
[4:37:36] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Are you saying they ain't?
[4:37:38] <+TossuDa> Everybody gangsta until the DJ starts killing people with his records
[4:37:39] <TioXyco> and that's wrong?
[4:37:44] <+Kairi__> SUPER. HOT
[4:37:46] <startstoprepeat> the shaun of the dead approach
[4:37:46] <OldManDeckardCain> they must have had some sharp tunes on them
[4:37:47] <%dukenux> Its weird that only this one level has music, and it's just DOOM soundtrack
[4:37:47] <%CommanderSqueaks> Are they not?
[4:37:47] <Kazic5000> Haven't you seen Shaun of the Dead?
[4:37:50] <@SoFarFetched> They must have watched Shaun of the Dead.
[4:37:53] <Profmcstevie> How about Paige throws one at your neck and you judge for yourself
[4:37:55] <%DappercatEsquire> ever throw one of those fuckers?
[4:37:59] <Kazic5000> @startstoprepeat My man
[4:38:03] <%SirGO0SE> the retun of KirbySauce...truly 2020 can't go there
[4:38:19] <%Agami23> didnt you watch shawn of the dead?
[4:38:23] <Kazic5000> SKULL
[4:38:25] <%Monkeyweed21> ask Woolie about it @PatStaresAt
[4:38:30] <penitentpentwitch> Sharpened Vinyl, for extra deep beats
[4:38:32] <%lockhead45> i left for like an hour, did he reach boss 1 yet?
[4:38:33] <audrus> i think its the slicing nature of it spinning fast and going fast
[4:38:34] <%MelBrooksKA> Give 50 back his skull
[4:38:39] <Jrockoni> what happened to Kirbysauce?
[4:38:43] <audrus> not because it has a honed edge
[4:38:44] <Profmcstevie> Sharpening my classic collection as we speak, they'll never catch me without my deadly bethoven
[4:38:50] <%CommanderSqueaks> I think Woolie would have a conniption if you threw a vinyl in his presence.
[4:38:57] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Something that thin going that fast might as well be sharp
