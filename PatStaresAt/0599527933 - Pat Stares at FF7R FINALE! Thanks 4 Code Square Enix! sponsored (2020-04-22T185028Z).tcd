[0:15:01] <%42nfl19> PSA in case anyone missed it. Apparently the source code for TF2 and CS:GO were leaked and people are warning not to play those games. Official and community servers. Also other source type games might be affected but it is unknown for now. People can potentially and easily attack your computer with malicious software.

[0:15:04] <%Zebroneath> Still going to leave your personal predictions for the very end?
[0:15:04] <%lord_traxis> The PS4 specifically stopped recording the last hour or so of the game
[0:15:05] <%SvenHolgersson> But Pat what about those who can't read
[0:15:06] <segbas2004> the stream should just be called SPOILERS

[0:19:12] <%Bane_Kaikyo> PogChamp500 FUCK YOU IT'S BIRTHUARY!! Take these birthday bits and pet the baby, but do so because you luv hem and not because I told you to.... KITTEN UPDATE: Flora is still cute. She figured out how to drink milk from a bowl so I don't have to feed her with a dropper. She is exploring freely more often but will still crawl up try to eat my beard and face. Artemis is warming up to her albeit slowly and erring on caution. Here's hoping they become friends in the near future and be cute n' shit

I'm jumping straight from having a PS3. Thanks and have a happy birthday.

[0:36:52] <%zenraider> but like how long has it been? should we be worried?
[0:36:55] <%aBlueWizard> The person at the door was himself from the future
[0:36:56] <%코코꾸라> It's just Tetsuya Nomura streaming
[0:36:56] <%schlager087> @Guardiansaiyan any ideas on a fix? or is it just busted? I like wookie but it's weird hearing a onesided convo
[0:36:57] <%Odyr2001> Pat died doing what he loved. Shitting himself
[0:36:59] <%ringabal> Who's Pat? Why am I here again?
[0:37:00] <%Valdorick> I can't believe Captian Planet and Pat are fighting off screen.
[0:37:01] <%Dreadlord134> Probably just FFVII REMAKE 2
[0:37:05] <%DukeBlack_> rather it just be Part 2
[0:37:06] <%Guardiansaiyan> @코코꾸라 maybe we can ask him questions he HAS to answer
[0:37:08] <%extradopeness> Pat went to Randy Pitchfords shadow palace to steal his USB drive
[0:37:10] <%Mornaka> it's been forever
[0:37:12] <%DukeBlack_> or Episode 2
[0:37:13] <%HIPSTERCORGl> HIPSTERCORGl subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months, currently on a 2 month streak! 
[0:37:15] <%YakumoYomi> @Doctadaking I'm imagine they'd go with a different word in the sequel to replace "Remake".
[0:37:16] <%Darkfire346> Itd be cool if they called it "Disc 2"
[0:37:16] <%Guardiansaiyan> @schlager087 I just kept refreshing
[0:37:19] <@StridentSong> Pat's busy dumping paint
[0:37:21] <%richmon_> @doctadaking or ff7 remake: remake
[0:37:23] <%Skittlesoul> @Doctadaking idealy it would be FF7 R Disc 2
[0:37:24] <%Darkfire346> cause htat would be technicvally right
[0:37:25] <%corgispudmen> psaHoldon psaRaffle
[0:37:25] <%therealgirthman> It's been... nine years

[0:37:37] <%GohanHitsugaya> If Pat's dead now... Does that mean Elmo takes over?
[0:37:43] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> Zaphire_Saucypants subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months! Hey, @PatStaresAt! Figured I'd finally give you some money on your B-day. Sadly, my cat Mischief had to be put down recently when they got the Feline Covid, so I've been dealing with that. Hoping this stream will help. Happy Birthday and enjoy the ending!
[0:37:44] <%Hepathos87> DONT PAT OPEN INSIDE
[0:37:48] <%starotter70> It's Pat's birthday, he can shit into his pants as much as he wants today

[0:38:11] <%Skittlesoul> he was attacked by the hell house he was living in this whole time
[0:38:11] <%ringabal> Why does the Twitch name say [REMOVED]StaresAt?

[1:18:59] <+Remery_> Heart Attack
[1:18:59] <%de1ete_forever> 1 easy trick to derail the canon plot, RETCON GHOSTS HATE IT
[1:19:00] <%luckysteak> THat is quite the hot take, Pat
[1:19:01] <%Solid_Stro> The helicopter pilot’s name is Mike. Oh no doodWAT
[1:19:03] <%KasiCrafter> Wedge has a HIGH Charisma stat.
[1:19:03] <%DrFacilier> they suck at their only job
[1:19:03] <%D3rrtyD4n> they do their best
[1:19:04] <%lotharrio> There seems to be only so many ghosts, yeah.
[1:19:05] <%Arxel1> Like they are LITERAL BEINGS that have to be in a place
[1:19:06] <%tigerfang86> there are a LIMITED NUMBER of ghosts
[1:19:06] <%amiroodude> They not all powerful
[1:19:06] <%coreyyotto> ...
[1:19:06] <%kaizerlith> A bet that helicopter pilots name is Mark.
[1:19:07] <%doc_ock_rokc> The Scripts are not omnipresent
[1:19:08] <%Maids4lyfe> BECAUSE FUCK DESTINY
[1:19:09] <%heartlesshealer> Sheer Heart Attack? D:
[1:19:11] <%mankeyfigh> @PatStaresAt As more time passes, the "Aerith and Sephiroth have future knowledge"theories hold less water for me...
[1:19:11] <%GarbageQueenEllie> That's actually pretty cool. Like a Soft!Determinism
[1:19:12] <%sporeian94> THEY DO IT FOR FREE PAT!
[1:19:13] <+PlagueOfGripes> they're more like Subway Ghosts

[1:19:22] <%valkuma> forced to use Aerith LUL
[1:19:23] <%Borkbiff > AUTO
[1:19:23] <%Felto3> They're probably making angry threads on /v/

[1:19:29] <%Birdigalore> DESTINY IS DESTINY
[1:19:31] <%cowardman93> Barret running off with his talking dog best friend
[1:19:31] <%Legato_Ambrose> And all the tension drips away
[1:19:31] <%heartlesshealer> And now Prayer returns to its rightful owner
[1:19:35] <%aBlueWizard> The ghost are /v/ being mad about changes.
[1:19:37] <%hahaha1171> Berret best girl
[1:19:37] <%CelioHogane> @mothmandraws and somehow it makes sense
[1:19:40] <%hzealot> the ghosts are such an innovative and neat and not ham strung addition to this game
[1:19:42] <%YakumoYomi> Lightning: "Destiny is destiny." Cloud: "Nah, tho."
[1:19:44] <%ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt Max described them as the Planet's White Blood Cells. There is only so much they can do
[1:19:46] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> I heard if you hit the wrong button 10 times you can catch mew
[1:19:48] <%KawaiiJetty> You're doing it Pat
[1:19:48] <%CrypticMochi> They’re volunteers, just kick them enough

[1:19:55] <%rufus2k2> @doc_ock_rokc That or Scriptors
[1:19:56] <%GarbageQueenEllie> If you're stuck with this team, Tifa and Aerith will be too busy making out to fight
[1:19:58] <%Aydarkzero> @YakumoYomi i don't know why i found that funny
[1:19:59] <%ringabal> YEAH HE DO IT
[1:20:00] <%MoraMiarty> some of those changes really suck blue wizard
[1:20:02] <%Dakuu75> is there a "swap all" option for materia?
[1:20:04] <%rufus2k2> like Scriptures
[1:20:06] <%boogaleeboo> Yeah, this is the point where you may want to stop robbing the third person to pay for the fourth

[1:20:41] <@SoFarFetched> He did get Levi
[1:20:45] <%luftraumm1> remember the original game barret fought the robot in the elevator
[1:20:45] <%valkuma> @PatStaresAt to save you frustration in like 20 minutes , both of them should be equipped fully
[1:20:46] <%spiritofmojave> ye Levi is on
[1:20:48] <%SABiscotti> Red

[1:21:03] <%DrFacilier> psaBig psaGoblin
[1:21:04] <%Meow0369> Bad idea
[1:21:05] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Red's voice is like smooth warm coffee. Slowly drink it in and relax
[1:21:05] <%Dragon_Batman> He'll see it when he gets there
[1:21:05] <%mankeyfigh> he's gonna be swapping materia around like a bitch THIS ENTIRE CHAPTER
[1:21:06] <%rufus2k2> do you not have extras
[1:21:08] <%Meow0369> Oh boy
[1:21:09] <%VritraReiRei> I want the dog to be a playable character :(
[1:21:10] <%luftraumm1> it's like the original
[1:21:11] <%MoonObscure> hes voice is perfect
[1:21:11] <%SABiscotti> Red's voice is absolutely perfect
[1:21:13] <%linSP> WHEN CAN YOU PLAY AS DOG
[1:21:13] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> I'm really liking Red's VA
[1:21:15] <%gmbt21xd> Pat your missing the point
[1:21:15] <%Meow0369> Well this'll be fun
[1:21:15] <%DeoxysPrime> Just split the difference
[1:21:16] <%Nupinoop296> how come it's still restricted to 3 characters at a time?
[1:21:18] <%gespenst25> Let's kill da Hoe-jo
[1:21:18] <%spiritofmojave> it's only 3 party members but the crew tags along
[1:21:21] <%hzealot> i just wouldnt worry about materia right now
[1:21:24] <%KasiCrafter> This is what you get for not spreading the EXP.
[1:21:26] <%TheAntitype> don't worry about it right now pat
[1:21:27] <%conradical> Ho(jo)'s mad
[1:21:27] <%heartlesshealer> Make Barret Full Paladin and have Aerith be magic DPS?
[1:21:29] <%Sir_stride> SUMMON
[1:21:31] <baronblank> yea, get ready to have everyone at least decently well equipped
[1:21:33] <%TheFabledAble> for fucks sake spec out EVERY CHARACTER YOU BABY MAN >:0
[1:21:41] <%CelioHogane> HEALING BULLETS
[1:21:42] <%ringabal> psaGoblin
[1:21:43] <%hahaha1171> if we can't play red i hope he's DLC.
[1:21:43] <%lotharrio> psaBig psaHoldon psaWrong
[1:21:44] <%tweedler92> Theres a menu prompt in the cutcene its fine
[1:21:44] <%pureotome> DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT RIGHT NOW
[1:21:45] <%coreyyotto> Pick your builds now
[1:21:45] <%42nfl19> Why not swap when it come time?
[1:21:49] <%ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt It's hilarious how despite Leviathan being your most recent Summon it has been actually impossible to use him because of the space restrictions
[1:21:50] <%DukeBlack_> Aerith literally doesn't need any high starred materia. she's strong as fuck
[1:21:50] <%Dragon_Batman> @Nupinoop296 That is how it was in the og
[1:21:50] <%kaizerlith> Ryuji's/Red's actor has some mad range. Couldn't tell it was the same guy at all.
[1:21:50] <@mothmandraws> wonder if healing bullets work on ghosts
[1:21:50] <%Aydarkzero> just buy more materia Kappa
[1:21:53] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> yeah, everyone should be equipped with somethin. Lots of switching around.
[1:21:53] <%valkuma> hahaha1171 i think he is going to be disk2 playable
[1:21:57] <%heartlesshealer> Give her Barrier!
[1:21:57] <%baronblank> I know the feeling, I kept swapping materia throughout this chapter for this exact reason
[1:22:07] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Dude, imagine if this game had an auto spec mechanic where they choose loadouts for you
[1:22:11] <%hzealot> put whatever you want on whoever you want
[1:22:11] <%Keyd00d> Pat barely needs materia at this level
[1:22:12] <%cowardman93> psaGoblin
[1:22:14] <%bevyrage> i can see pat sweating
[1:22:15] <%Aydarkzero> oh man Pat's got it real bad right now
[1:22:17] <%hzealot> trust me dont worry about it @PatStaresAt
[1:22:17] <%spiritofmojave> It's gonna take a lot of menuing nedt few hours
[1:22:19] <%Dreadlord134> Give cloud elemental for fire sword
[1:22:22] <%spiritofmojave> *next
[1:22:22] <%NitronStreams> psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin
[1:22:23] <%luftraumm1> breathe pat
[1:22:26] <%thackattack00> psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin
[1:22:26] <%Dakuu75> I can hear pat sweating
[1:22:28] <%startstoprepeat> just give aerith both magic ups, it's literally all she needs to be the best
[1:22:29] <%Solid_Stro> psaGoblin
[1:22:29] <%Alpha8087> Pat big panic
[1:22:31] <%Nupinoop296> @Dragon_Batman yeah, but i feel like with an updated engine and stuff it would be cooler/funner to allow up to 4 or so at once, like how in KH3 they upped the limit to 5 party members
[1:22:32] <%baronblank> also put a summon on barret while you're at it
[1:22:33] <%Dwarven_Gaming> the mind goblins are going for the kill jesus
[1:22:34] <%JohnAtDawn> Pat you will just need to eventually have four maxed out for healing and the elements
[1:22:35] <%Nobrev> yeah for this chapter all 4 characters need to be equipped up
[1:22:36] <%collind99> psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin
[1:22:38] <%baronblank> you have more than 3 at this point
[1:22:38] <%spiritofmojave> !goblins at risk!
[1:22:40] <%coreyyotto> Now do you see why we told you level up all the materia?
[1:22:40] <%lotharrio> What if Barret has Fire fun AND Lightning Gun?
[1:22:44] <%luftraumm1> breathe you goblin man
[1:22:45] <%weissguard> psaGoblin psaBig psaHoldon psaGoblin
[1:22:48] <%mankeyfigh> MATERIA SWAPPING - ITS MATERIA SWAPPING
[1:22:51] <%axiomthunder> right and left on the dpad will page up and down
[1:22:57] <%de1ete_forever> Pat is so over levelled I can't even
[1:22:58] <%amused_platypus> shouldve grinded pat
[1:23:02] <%hzealot> @lotharrio only the one earliest in the weapon is used
[1:23:02] <%heartlesshealer> Yeah, haver her synergize with someone who has a better version of the elemental attack magicites
[1:23:05] <%Pyroclase> Materia Fantasy 7
[1:23:06] <%hahaha1171> @valkuma i know in the next one. i meant in this game. thanks though
[1:23:08] <%GarbageQueenEllie> psaGoblin Happy Happy Birthday psaGoblin
[1:23:09] <%starotter70> You're doing it
[1:23:11] <%thebetterbard> I did the exact same thing patit's okayt
[1:23:14] <%Dwarven_Gaming> uhhhh
[1:23:17] <%heartlesshealer> magicite? I mean materia
[1:23:19] <%Dwarven_Gaming> warding doesnt work that wat
[1:23:19] <%aishman> @PatStaresAt Say Pat, is green next to blue part of the psaGoblin ?
[1:23:22] <%GohanHitsugaya> Can you get another Magnify materia in the game? Or is there just the one?
[1:23:24] <%arcielardor> @patstaresat So does this mean we're not going to get the Red 13/Aerith dating sim minigame they promised?
[1:23:24] <%Solid_Stro> I’m a take nap, wake me when it’s over
[1:23:25] <%mankeyfigh> Pat if you don't do this perfectly you'll have a bad time
[1:23:28] <%Dragon_Batman> @Nupinoop296 I think it would be neat to have a 4th but I imagine it is balanced with 3 in mind. I doubt it but they could make it 4 in the next one considering how big the party gets but who knows
[1:23:29] <%Keyd00d> You're fine because overlevel
[1:23:32] <%luftraumm1> maximize time?
[1:23:33] <%Dwarven_Gaming> warding is tied to material tied to it
[1:23:33] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> @GohanHitsugaya sadly, just one.
[1:23:35] <%hzealot> this is your fault chat
[1:23:39] <%GohanHitsugaya> Damn
[1:23:41] <%startstoprepeat> yeah put provoke on aerith
[1:23:42] <%ringabal> @PatStaresAt You have a spare Prayer
[1:23:42] <%valkuma> hahaha1171 yeah i dont know how they would do DLC for this though excpet giving us side stories.. like maybe a Red Backstory dlc or something? could be cool
[1:23:45] <%JohnAtDawn> You're going to put Aerith with ONE SPELL?
[1:23:46] <%Meow0369> Just buy 8 hp ups
[1:23:46] <%de1ete_forever> YOU'VED DOOMED US ALL
[1:23:47] <%heartlesshealer> Give her Refocus because why not
[1:23:49] <%Hobojo153> Refocus is pretty good
[1:23:49] <%coreyyotto> ! PAT AT RISK !
[1:23:51] <%Nobrev> @PatStaresAt you need every character equipped with stuff theyre gonna use
[1:23:51] <%mankeyfigh> psaHoldon psaHoldon psaHoldon psaHoldon
[1:23:53] <%VritraReiRei> no it's the BEST
[1:23:58] <%ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt Have you been able to use Leviathan ONCE since getting him?
[1:23:59] <%hzealot> @Nobrev you really dont
[1:24:00] <%bevyrage> do you not have more than 3 summons?
[1:24:00] <%Doctadaking> Steadfast block is good
[1:24:01] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt SUMMON MATERIA
[1:24:08] <%Robot_Nixon_> No magic just brute force everything Kappa
[1:24:09] <%CelioHogane> SUMMON
[1:24:10] <%hzealot> literally stop its fine
[1:24:11] <%spiritofmojave> Wait really?
[1:24:11] <%luftraumm1> summon
[1:24:13] <%Dragon_Batman> Leviathan is tricky
[1:24:13] <%valkuma> leviathan being elementless FeelsBadMan
[1:24:15] <@JustinianKnight> wut
[1:24:15] <%Solid_Stro> Pat Stares at Materia
[1:24:16] <%spiritofmojave> That sucks
[1:24:16] <%baronblank> put a summon on everyone
[1:24:17] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> requires full bar
[1:24:22] <%heartlesshealer> Pat
[1:24:23] <%Robot_Nixon_> water isnt an element LUL
[1:24:23] <%Pyroclase> It's too big to fit in the building, is why
[1:24:25] <+Remery_> Levianthan is the best
[1:24:28] <%gespenst25> yes you are
[1:24:30] <%Dragon_Batman> LEvi is big so he can't fit everywhere
[1:24:30] <%Verd_254> is warding not linked with an element?
[1:24:31] <+Remery_> Looks so cool
[1:24:33] <%luftraumm1> Levi is awesome
[1:24:35] <%Djinnazz> no it's not
[1:24:36] <%YakumoYomi> Pat's party is like...one level below where mine was when I finished the game.
[1:24:37] <%TsunamiPoro> big mind goblins
[1:24:39] <%Maids4lyfe> everyone else I've watched has used Leviathan
[1:24:41] <%GarbageQueenEllie> The remake's materia mechanic looks great
[1:24:42] <%heartlesshealer> Warding needs to be element-linked
[1:24:42] <%imthewisejanitor> Honestly, if they kept up the quality, I'd be willing to buy any more side stories/summons/whatever they inevitably have planned for DLC.
[1:24:43] <%spiritofmojave> Levi is best primal server and boi
[1:24:45] <%linSP> I hope they let you autoslot materia for phys attack, tank, magic etc
[1:24:46] <%RoggleJr> You did it!
[1:24:47] <%valkuma> oh yeah thats funny too, youll be in a fight and cant summon Levi because hes too big
[1:24:52] <%kapcommunist> this is me choosing what 3 appetizers to get at chilis
[1:24:53] <%TheFabledAble> we love you. we also fuck with you
[1:24:57] <%KawaiiJetty> psaUp
[1:25:01] <%corgispudmen> Link the Ice or lighting metira PAT
[1:25:06] <%baronblank> not to annoy your goblins, but aerith should have shiva or leviathan since they're the magic boosting summons
[1:25:09] <+Remery_> I mean you don't have to do this again because you can move your materia to every weapon you equip
[1:25:11] <%Hobojo153> Waifu squad go
[1:25:12] <%hzealot> i cannot wait for pat to lose his shit
[1:25:14] <%Nobrev> last backseat for the stream I promise @PatStaresAt link warding to thunder

[1:33:16] <%UvBenServed> Burn all of it, ESPECIALLY Chadley
[1:33:16] <%WritebroAlpha> ONE GUY
[1:33:17] <%cowardman93> Hojo is the true villain
[1:33:18] <%Meow0369> Hojo is arguably worse than hitler
[1:33:19] <%starotter70> Pretty much
[1:33:19] <%PhysicsLB> LUCRECIA
[1:33:20] <%Ipsenscastle> Hojo is the ultimate one guy
[1:33:20] <%Ancopro> one guy hojo
[1:33:20] <%TsunamiPoro> Sephiroth is honestly a victim
[1:33:20] <@JustinianKnight> well, sorta, but yeah
[1:33:21] <%CelioHogane> SEPHIROTH WAS A VICTIM!
[1:33:21] <%cowardman93> all for his Fetish
[1:33:21] <%Guardiansaiyan> ONE GUY
[1:33:21] <%rufus2k2> I wish XB2's Rex had that kind of range
[1:33:22] <%aBlueWizard> BUT HE GETS TO VACATION ON THE BEACH
[1:33:22] <%pureotome> ALL HOJO'S FAULT
[1:33:22] <%DrFacilier> the real Pontiff Sulyvhan
[1:33:23] <%heartlesshealer> yeah
[1:33:23] <%Pyroclase> Eh, it's really more JENOVA's fault than anything.
[1:33:23] <%Aracon_> Hojo is the one guy
[1:33:24] <%Sir_stride> Its more Shinras as well
[1:33:24] <%WritebroAlpha> O N E GUY
[1:33:24] <%j0ustar> true
[1:33:25] <%spiritofmojave> all the power ONE GUY
[1:33:26] <%valriot> Hojo was behind it all. Hes evil, and he loves it, and you gotta respect that
[1:33:27] <%snugglepuggs> Reunion line makes so much sense now that im playing OG FFvii
[1:33:27] <%Xenokhrist> Gast bears some responsibility too i'd say but yeah, Hojo's the real shit
[1:33:27] <%aBlueWizard> WHICH BIKINI LADIES
[1:33:28] <%PanicSwytch> Hojo is the ONE GUY
[1:33:28] <%tigerfang86> oh WOW
[1:33:28] <%Hoot_Patoots> like maybe you could point at president shinra but mostly Hojo
[1:33:28] <%MalekDracarus> Like Pontiff from DS3
[1:33:28] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> Indeed
[1:33:29] <%ringabal> "See, it all started with this cuck named Vincent."
[1:33:30] <%SummonerMagno> psa1guy
[1:33:31] <@JustinianKnight> Seph is super not a victim lol
[1:33:33] <%TsunamiPoro> Sephiroth did nothing wrong
[1:33:34] <%42nfl19> @PatStaresAt Has Reunion become as nonsense as "The Darkness"?
[1:33:35] <%cowardman93> I' member pods!
[1:33:36] <+Remery_> Sephiroth did nothing wrong :)
[1:33:36] <%KawaiiJetty> Thanks Hojo, thanks Shinra
[1:33:36] <%MonsterEnvy> It's Hojo and Jenova's fault
[1:33:36] <%hassanico2> What use even are they?!
[1:33:37] <+PlagueOfGripes> Who was Hojo's mother? Some sort of wildebeast?
[1:33:37] <%Keyd00d> well, Jenova too
[1:33:38] <%Birdigalore> Feels like Godzilla 1998
[1:33:39] <%kaizerlith> With Dirge Hojo even lasts longer than Sephiroth.
[1:33:39] <%tigerfang86> Sephiroth did a lot wrong
[1:33:39] <%Meow0369> Seph WAS a victim turned abuser
[1:33:40] <%doc_ock_rokc> I love when the villian is the fucking nerd who does little
[1:33:40] <%Typhaeon> Oh no a monodrive

[1:33:47] <%LandOfTheWay> Hojo truly is the most powerful ONE GUY
[1:33:49] <%JohnAtDawn> Reminder Prof Gast found out Jenova's truth and went hard "oh shit" but Hojo was like "harder mommy"
[1:33:51] <%boogaleeboo> seph was implanted with alien mindfuck genes in the womb
[1:33:52] <%CelioHogane> @JustinianKnight if he wasn't born without the Jenova bullshit, he wouldn't have gone insane
[1:33:52] <@mothmandraws> sudden choir

[1:35:10] <%WritebroAlpha> It is important to pee right now so as to avoid pausing to pee at any time in the next two hours or so. You know it to be true, chat.
[1:35:11] <%Meow0369> @Story_Ark It's a flashback to when she wore that outfit

[1:40:46] <%Hoot_Patoots> how fucked up if you looked into those pods and it's all Chadley
[1:40:48] <%hzealot> nope
[1:40:49] <%SaphronBlackbourne> He's a cat
[1:40:49] <%ScreamLord> Cloud's a classy lady
[1:40:52] <%TheAntitype> @kaizerlith oh I forgot about the uniform, I'm so hyped now
[1:40:54] <%therealgirthman> [MUFFLED BLACK YELLING]
[1:40:57] <%TsunamiPoro> Nope this part owns
[1:40:58] <%DakotaMacDoodle> I can nit wait for him to put on a sailor uniform in 6 years
[1:41:01] <%spiritofmojave> @nitronstreams that'd be really good as a choice, but no think it's someone else
[1:41:03] <%Keyd00d> He's a lab rat dog
[1:41:12] <+PlagueOfGripes> Nanaki slam dunk
[1:41:13] <%kapcommunist> dog punch!
[1:41:14] <%Hoot_Patoots> @DakotaMacDoodle oh my god same. I hope they keep that
[1:41:15] <%starotter70> @NitronStreams Max Mittelman, aka Ryuji from P5
[1:41:15] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Red's the coolest!
[1:41:18] <%saiyan24675> @nitronstreams Red is voiced by the same guy who does Ryuji Max Mittleman
[1:41:18] <%Doctadaking> This section is cool, but it is obvious filler
[1:41:24] <%crimsonphoenix69> Red XIII is voiced by Ryuji
[1:41:25] <%DakotaMacDoodle> *not
[1:41:27] <%spiritofmojave> Oh shit that's Ryuji?
[1:41:28] <%Dragon_Batman> I love catching Red in slow mo
[1:41:29] <%NitronStreams> thanks
[1:41:31] <%baronouroboros> Lab rat cat dog
[1:41:32] <%Aydarkzero> while this part is long it's not as bad as 15's Lab part
[1:41:32] <%DukeBlack_> more content = filler
[1:41:33] <%spiritofmojave> VA has major range
[1:41:34] <%Hoot_Patoots> @DakotaMacDoodle I also hope they put red in the suit
[1:41:40] <%TheAntitype> Max Mittelman
[1:41:40] <%baronouroboros> lab-rat cat-dog
[1:41:43] <%Keyd00d> Eh, felt like a slog
[1:41:49] <%DakotaMacDoodle> They must
[1:41:50] <%Story_Ark> no wonder he joins them so late, if he joined earlier he would have been like HEY EVERYONE WE'RE AVALANCHE!!!
[1:41:55] <%baronouroboros> lab-rat cat-dog!
[1:41:56] <%Doctadaking> FFXV chapter 13 was so bad that they had to give us an alternate one
[1:41:57] <%therealgirthman> Haha gun go BRRRR
[1:42:06] <%linSP> This was my three man
[1:42:23] <%Valdorick> I bed Guest Party Memember Red13 uses his ATB gauge without prompting psaSmug
[1:42:24] <%Hoot_Patoots> i kinda wanna replay XV by curiosity. I liked that game even tho with all the flaws at release and i kinda wanna have a go now with all the dlc and additions
[1:42:24] <%de1ete_forever> what a monster closet
[1:42:24] <%Daskolin> Just imagine amount of Nanaki pornz being commissioned!
[1:42:29] <%Dragon_Batman> Starlight looks great
[1:42:31] <%Aydarkzero> LOOK AT THESE GUYS
[1:42:33] <%acecondeuce> BALLS
[1:42:37] <%spiritofmojave> BIG ORBS
[1:42:37] <%Hoot_Patoots> oh fuck this monster
[1:42:38] <%Aracon_> big floating ball
[1:42:39] <%LouieRouie> Wasss onccce a MAN!
[1:42:41] <@mothmandraws> M O T H
[1:42:47] <%SH1NK1R0> People don’t actually know what filler is. The return to sewers was filler. This is just an extra level
[1:42:49] <%karl_rex> O R B
[1:42:50] <%papertoonz1414> MOTH ORBS
[1:42:52] <%j0ustar> S P E E N unit
[1:42:53] <%NitronStreams> MOTH er
[1:42:54] <%baronouroboros> Hojo would've totally worked at UMBRELLA
[1:42:54] <%ScottishMadJacko> Hey its big wheel from robots
[1:42:57] <%spiritofmojave> It's your kin :o @mothmandraws
[1:43:01] <%Alpha8087> Its robo Mothman!
[1:43:01] <%Meow0369> Yep
[1:43:03] <%Valdorick> I can't believe FF14 superstar Mothmandraws got into FF7 and is killing Pat.
[1:43:06] <%Meow0369> That's how I cheesed every one of them
[1:43:14] <%Ynkubus18> @Daskolin slightly more than usual?
[1:43:16] <%ringabal> Cloud: " ow ow ow ow ow"
[1:43:18] <%Shadowtalon77> hey look a giant manhack
[1:43:20] <+PlagueOfGripes> I put him in a corner and infinity-parried him
[1:43:25] <%hassanico2> Were these things in the original?
[1:43:25] <%Hoot_Patoots> fighting those in hard mode is hell
[1:43:32] <+PlagueOfGripes> yup
[1:43:35] <%hzealot> @SH1NK1R0 but i do know what is cool and yet, and we are steadily approaching it
[1:43:40] <%therealgirthman> psaBig Balls
[1:43:43] <%Aracon_> yeah just eat all the slices to the chest
[1:43:46] <+PlagueOfGripes> they weren't mini-bosses or anything, of course. just enemies
[1:43:48] <%de1ete_forever> many pods
[1:43:49] <%Meow0369> Oh you think
[1:43:50] <%aBlueWizard> there's so may stupid enemies in this game that people forget were in the original.
[1:43:51] <%therealgirthman> Girthy balls, even Kappa
[1:43:53] <%Meow0369> Just a bit
[1:43:55] <%lionmanguy> NO horrible psychological scaring here, no sire
[1:43:56] <%MonsterEnvy> Hojo lab is big
[1:43:58] <%Hoot_Patoots> I hope futurep arts do Triceratank
[1:43:59] <%ringabal> The developers gave Red so much that they could've saved for Disc 2
[1:43:59] <%DJLavender> Clouds final weapon ability is so fucking broken and powerful I can't wait for Pat to get it.
[1:44:00] <%Dragon_Batman> It makes sense considering Hojo is a freak
[1:44:03] <Hoot_Patoots> and also skeleton bikes
[1:44:05] <%rufus2k2> very on point Barret
[1:44:10] <%breezybrie96> It's just Umbrella at this point
[1:44:11] <%Meow0369> Just a tiny little expansion compared to the original where you spend about 10 minutes total including the fights
[1:44:11] <%amiroodude> How did barret lose the girls?
[1:44:12] <+Remery_> I bet Hojo doesn't wash his balls
[1:44:20] <%Doctadaking> Barret speaking on the player’s behalf
[1:44:24] <%D3rrtyD4n> clap
[1:44:29] <%therealgirthman> Hojo 100% has a smegma problem
[1:44:30] <%hassanico2> Wait does Barret have a defibrilator gun equipped right now?
[1:44:31] <%Robot_Nixon_> FeelsBirthdayMan
[1:44:31] <%Pyroclase> Hojo is your favorite character?
[1:44:32] <%Ipsenscastle> Is it quietly playing snatches of the bike chase song?
[1:44:32] <%D3rrtyD4n> FeelsBirthdayMan
[1:44:33] <%Malisin_Murder> FeelsBirthdayMan
[1:44:33] <%aBlueWizard> Hojo?
[1:44:33] <%Borkbiff > But Gackt isn't here
[1:44:34] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Happy Happy Borthday! Happy Birthday game!
[1:44:35] <%Aracon_> the moth unit is your favorite?
[1:44:35] <%ScottishMadJacko> Hojo you mean?
[1:44:36] <%hzealot> oh boy, this section, how exhausting
[1:44:36] <+PlagueOfGripes> it's okay to clap when you see the red
[1:44:37] <%arancet> but no touching him!
[1:44:40] <%UvBenServed> Wedge
[1:44:44] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> They do Red 13 right in dis game.
[1:44:46] <%GohanHitsugaya> Clap clap
[1:44:47] <+Remery_> clapped your asscheeks
[1:44:47] <%Aydarkzero> good Weapon
[1:44:48] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> Please don't talk about Hojo that way
[1:44:48] <%PlainSimpleTailor> I hope they have DLC that gives Barrett a Mohawk
[1:44:49] <%Hoot_Patoots> HERE IS COUNTERSTANCE
[1:44:51] <%DJLavender> YEYEYEYEYEYE
[1:44:53] <%Legato_Ambrose> It's legally required to clap when you see the red, in fact.
[1:44:54] <%hassanico2> Fancy sword!
[1:44:55] <%GarbageQueenEllie> oooOOOHH!
[1:44:55] <%the_vedo_show> OP
[1:44:57] <%Ipsenscastle> STING SOME TWINS
[1:44:57] <%Robot_Nixon_> Pet Red PunOko
[1:44:57] <%Dreadlord134> Hojo?
[1:44:57] <%Hoot_Patoots> aka best ability
[1:44:58] <%NitronStreams> MORE WEAPONS
[1:44:58] <%RyanTheRecluse> oh that's right, Pat's birthday today isn't it?
[1:44:58] <%Dragon_Batman> Fuck yea
[1:45:00] <%rufus2k2> COUNTERSTANCE
[1:45:01] <%UvBenServed> Fancy
[1:45:01] <%Aracon_> this weapon is the best
[1:45:01] <%Nupinoop296> :O Stinger....
[1:45:01] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> counterstance is fuckin great
[1:45:01] <+PlagueOfGripes> well, other than giving him script reading powers for whatever reason
[1:45:02] <%WritebroAlpha> I can't believe Pat's favourite character is noted piece of shit Hojo!
[1:45:04] <%ringabal> That's a DMC weapon
[1:45:04] <%mankeyfigh> its a sucky weapon, good ability
[1:45:05] <%ScreamLord> Like a small orange seal
[1:45:05] <%ScottishMadJacko> Counterstance might be clouds strongest move
[1:45:06] <%optimasmaximas> this weapon is prob second best
[1:45:06] <%Dragon_Batman> This weapon is awesome
[1:45:06] <%boogaleeboo> It's like your triangle parry but a million times better
[1:45:07] <%kapcommunist> it looks cool though
[1:45:08] <%poker4121> the best ability in the game
[1:45:12] <%Meow0369> I've heard that counterstance is really good but I never used it
[1:45:12] <%linSP> Dang rat cat lookin like scar from the lion king
[1:45:13] <%Doctadaking> This move is broken
[1:45:15] <%redlanternreviews> Shinra is Umbrella if they also went into energy instead of just bioweapons
[1:45:16] <%ratreborn> Devil Sword Cloud
[1:45:19] <%Hoot_Patoots> it's reaaaaally good
[1:45:21] <%ScreamLord> MANY slots
[1:45:22] <%DJLavender> It can counter magic attacks awsell
[1:45:25] <%Dragon_Batman> Counterstance is super gooood
[1:45:25] <%hassanico2> Elemental sword?
[1:45:30] <%코코꾸라> magic sword
[1:45:31] <%Aracon_> best ability, super balanced stats, good passives
[1:45:35] <%Aracon_> just a really solid weapon
[1:45:36] <%de1ete_forever> Amano ass looking sword
[1:45:38] <+PlagueOfGripes> not so great at countering Behemoths, but does just fine on most things
[1:45:39] <%amiroodude> That move is actually OP
[1:45:39] <%Ipsenscastle> Man I can't wait for Devil Sword Nero
[1:45:41] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> Magic sword, neat
[1:45:42] <%hassanico2> Oh it's just a jack of all trades weapon?
[1:45:42] <%Aydarkzero> @hassanico2 think of it as a can do all weapon
[1:45:43] <%GarbageQueenEllie> I wonder what happens to all the materia after shit goes down. Does it have a shelf life?
[1:45:48] <%baronouroboros> Umbrella, a subsiduary of Shnra
[1:45:50] <%Daskolin> Its a Migic sword
[1:45:56] <%Roundelay11> it's REALLY good
[1:46:02] <%Pyroclase> Somehow I feel like Pat isn't going to need to be warned not to play TF2 today.
[1:46:04] <%DJLavender> Stupid powerfully broken.
[1:46:05] <%mankeyfigh> still not better than the buster sword...
[1:46:11] <+Remery_> I think Lightning looks the best on Cloud's swords. And it's also great against Shinra enemies.
[1:46:26] <%Aydarkzero> i like using this weapon b/c i don't have to worry about Magic Up Materia since it comes with a bonus damage
[1:46:28] <%Aracon_> and later on it gets reprieve which is a god send in hard mode
[1:46:28] <%Dragon_Batman> IT trades more slots for a little less stats
[1:46:33] <%Doctadaking> After all the upgrades and such, I ended up using the Buster Sword over everything else
[1:46:36] <%pmoneydarthswagg> Keep buster sword for endgame cutscenes
[1:46:38] <%LandOfTheWay> @Remery_ i dunno, i thought lightning looked better in her own games Kappa
[1:46:43] <%GeneralSCPatton> @redlanternreviews Good news Wesker! We can triple the growth rate of our bioweapons if we get them to consume their victim's flesh AND soul.
[1:46:44] <%tinyswampthing> is it just tf2 and csgo thats bad to play today or is steam in gernal not good
[1:46:47] <%conradical> counterstance is my favey
[1:46:52] <%hassanico2> Imagine if one of Cloud's dresses was a Lightning cosplay
[1:46:56] <%Felto3> i used twin stinger for everything, its great
[1:46:56] <%Kiyosuki> I like Wind on the swords visually myself, cause the color of the mako etc
[1:47:02] <%optimasmaximas> @Aracon_ do you know how to get that for it? would like to know for my own use
[1:47:06] <%the_vedo_show> 0 nice
[1:47:11] <%MattzosoSA> Don't really know how twitch subscription messages work, so I dunno if you'll see this, but just wanted to say that I've been a fan since like the Chip and Ironicus days. You're the first person I've subscribed to since I never chat, but I heard it's your birthday, so I wanted to send some love your way for all the years of entertainment. Thanks dude, have a good one.
[1:47:21] <%Doctadaking> All he needed to complete the outfit is a windsword!
[1:47:23] <%burgerdicks> really hope those port over between the remake games
[1:47:23] <%DonatelloJose> That's really funny. WOW
[1:47:24] <%Dragon_Batman> That works
[1:47:28] <%ringabal> It comes full circle
[1:47:29] <%baronouroboros> So , what in Jenovah's name is this materia stuff? Are they drugs?
[1:47:32] <%Aydarkzero> Muscle Memory real strong
[1:47:33] <%MoraMiarty> I guess blackest night is kinda a counter yeah
[1:47:34] <%therealgirthman> It's like pottery
[1:47:37] <%spiritofmojave> FF14 doing good things to the brain for once
[1:47:37] <%therealgirthman> It rhymes
[1:47:40] <%Aracon_> @optimasmaximas yeah you have to level up the weapon (weapon levlel 6). Best way to do that is to get a manuscript for cloud
[1:47:43] <%hassanico2> @baronouroboros crystalized energy
[1:47:43] <%umbrus89> THATS HOW I DO IT SENCE I ALSO PLAY DRK lol
[1:47:44] <%WhereIsWill> doodBigBrain doodBigBrain doodBigBrain
[1:47:45] <%Kiyosuki> Well he is basically a DRK isn't he
[1:47:45] <%rontopronto> "Brain Memory" as opposed to lung memory or kidney memory
[1:47:47] <%mankeyfigh> the design isn't half-bad
[1:47:50] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Who wants to shoot up materia with me behind the bleachers?
[1:47:51] <%luftraumm1> yeaaaaa blackest night
[1:47:52] <%baronouroboros> Crystallized, huh.
[1:47:54] <%lord_traxis> Orbs of condensed ghost
[1:48:03] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Why is this reminding me of PargonPargonPargon?
[1:48:04] <%conradical> i put it on X cause it reminds me of the FE counters from Smash
[1:48:07] <%baronouroboros> Blorbs
[1:48:11] <@SoFarFetched> @MattzosoSA When twitch tells you it's your sub anniversary,there will be a prompt in the chat saying "Share your sub anniversary in chat"
[1:48:11] <%optimasmaximas> @Aracon_ ah okay, i think i got the first 3 but need to wait for the rest in hard mode, thanks man
[1:48:12] <%baronouroboros> Blorb drugs
[1:48:16] <%boogaleeboo> you gave him a buff up
[1:48:28] <%luftraumm1> time?
[1:48:32] <%Dragon_Batman> Time or barrier
[1:48:32] <%baronouroboros> cooked up in patented SHINRA labs
[1:48:34] <%mankeyfigh> Why don't you sell your extra Materia copies?
[1:48:42] <%Dragon_Batman> Oh good
[1:48:43] <%amused_platypus> hp absorb sounds good
[1:48:43] <@CreepyPorpoise> CreepyPorpoise subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months! creepy49Porpkek
[1:48:43] <%Nobrev> i put it on triangle because that's the punisher mode button and I use switching to punisher as a counter through most of the game
[1:48:46] <%hassanico2> @mankeyfigh they sell for shit in this game
[1:48:47] <%TrueSpartan14> Counterstance is so good!
[1:48:51] <%DJLavender> Holy fuck. I think I missed the 2nd elemental materia.
[1:48:55] <%Pyroclase> Look at this fucking FRPG magic sword
[1:48:56] <%luftraumm1> nice
[1:49:02] <%코코꾸라> RED JUMP
[1:49:05] <%SH1NK1R0> Technically materia is made of mako so in a way it’s like soul gems that give you abilities
[1:49:06] <%NitronStreams> FETCH
[1:49:08] <%Aracon_> @optimasmaximas sure no problem, iirc you can find a manuscript for him in the post game VR missions as well
[1:49:08] <%redlanternreviews> Catdog, fetch!
[1:49:09] <%Hoot_Patoots> also i heard earlier if you use stop on a staggered enemy, it stops the stagger gauge but i have yet to verify
[1:49:11] <%linSP> Where is elemental 2
[1:49:13] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> well of course
[1:49:17] <+PlagueOfGripes> this final sword is really dumb looking
[1:49:19] <%Nobrev> BUSTER SWORD BEST SWORD
[1:49:19] <%Alpha8087> FETCH
[1:49:19] <%GarbageQueenEllie> But this one is so fancyyyy
[1:49:20] <%valriot> Buster sword is actually the best

[1:50:29] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Yeah, having the whole gang's awesome
[1:50:29] <%crimsonphoenix69> not money, Materia

[1:50:30] <%logoth_> Yuffie's nomura's big favorite
[1:50:30] <%Kiyosuki> I can't wait to see how the remaining characters are realized gameplay wise
[1:50:32] <%Dementedpenguin> Pat's Final Fantasy 7
[1:50:32] <%toastybites> Spot on
[1:50:32] <%mankeyfigh> I wonder if the next game will add party switching?
[1:50:33] <%JoshyJ> yuffie shreiks about matteria
[1:50:34] <%rufus2k2> I really don't remember Cid hitting his wife
[1:50:34] <%Story_Ark> yuffie and cloud will bond over money
[1:50:35] <%amiroodude> And red 13 will say woof
[1:50:36] <%WanderTasogare> and Cait sith is gonna go full scottish
[1:50:39] <%Meow0369> PHS
[1:50:40] <%YakumoYomi> Yuffie's gonna be like "I'm Kyri--I mean, Yuffie!"
[1:50:40] <%reinbachthe3rd> Holy crap, what sword is that?
[1:50:41] <%JohnAtDawn> VINCENTS VA BETTER FUCKING KILL IT. STEVE BLUM WAS PERFECT AS VIN.
[1:50:41] <%shurtal> fuckin' PHS Terminal
[1:50:41] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Wrong number, who dis?
[1:50:43] <%Aydarkzero> New Phone who dis?
[1:50:43] <%pureotome> YEYEYEYE PHS PogChamp PogChamp
[1:50:43] <%Pyroclase> Is that you, Sephiroth??
[1:50:44] <%DonatelloJose> he left out cait sith on purpose
[1:50:46] <%Visorak6> NEW PHONE WHO DIS
[1:50:46] <%sniffy77> Did Hojo cuck Vincent or something
[1:50:46] <%LouieRouie> It said PHS
[1:50:47] <@SoFarFetched> @MattzosoSA hey no problem SeemsGood next best thing to do though if you want a message read is cheer 500 bits (about 5 dollars) so he can read your message.
[1:50:47] <%ShichiNoBushi> What about Cait Sith?
[1:50:48] <%rufus2k2> >steve blum
[1:50:48] <%NitronStreams> Whos Talking?
[1:50:48] <%Guardiansaiyan> Cait Sith is gonna be in charge of money cause he IS A DIRECTOR of a company
[1:50:48] <%luftraumm1> PhD terminal
[1:50:49] <%lotharrio> Vince is gonna show up and be like, "Yo, Lecretia was so hot. I gave her so many donations on stream but she always looked at that LOSER, Hojo!"
[1:50:50] <%furiousfurioso> coxSuure
[1:50:51] <%saiyan24675> No Vincent would be going Lucerica
[1:50:51] <%Legato_Ambrose> Cid is self-aware and realizes how dumb time ghosts are.
[1:50:52] <%talon84> New com, Who dis?
[1:50:53] <%KawaiiJetty> I'm excited for Vincent gameplay. I love his gun
[1:50:54] <%DJLavender> Fuck. I somehow missed some oddjobs
[1:50:54] <%hassanico2> HO JO
[1:50:55] <@mothmandraws> still funny that they mixed up the dragoon and machinist personality steretypes in ff7
[1:50:58] <%hmgirlpopuri> I wouldn't be surprised if Yuffie's role gets expanded given more attention to the Wutai war in this game so far
[1:50:59] <%Guardiansaiyan> Cait Sith in charge of budget
[1:51:00] <%SH1NK1R0> @hoot_patoots it was nuts. I’ve beaten this game twice and never thought of it and he just did it on a whim and wrecked the dog in the slums side quests chat was freaking out
[1:51:01] <%Tearonex> psaBlind didn't see what the terminal says
[1:51:02] <$badfurson> Party1000 Oiya! Happy birthday Pat! This is my first time cheering/using Twitch, since I normally watch on Youtube. How are you liking Final Fantasy: MK9?
[1:51:04] <%DrFacilier> kick hojo from the discord
[1:51:05] <%richmon_> @patstaresat vincent will be completely redone
[1:51:06] <%ringabal> GUUDBAI HO JO
[1:51:06] <%radiocrawler> It’s all according to Hojo’s plan.
[1:51:08] <%luftraumm1> look at the communicator
[1:51:08] <%zk_nails> don't forget Cait Seth
[1:51:09] <%Nobrev> @rufus2k2 I dont think he hit her but he did yell at her a lot and she reacted like he threatened her often
[1:51:09] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> Hojo, always the bridesmaid's bitch.
[1:51:11] <%Kiyosuki> Like I could see Cid's Triangle attack being a chargable Jump attack, and his abilities are all gadgets. Like a DRG and MCH hybrid.
[1:51:13] <%PlainSimpleTailor> IVE HEARD THAT VOICE
[1:51:16] <%TheAntitype> how the FUCK is this entire thing in the upper part of the shinra tower
[1:51:16] <%D3rrtyD4n> wat
[1:51:16] <%radiocrawler> Omniscient Hojo
[1:51:17] <%PlainSimpleTailor> WHO IS THAT
[1:51:20] <%baronouroboros> EVIL LAUGH
[1:51:21] <%CelioHogane> @SH1NK1R0 do you want DLC before the next game releases?
[1:51:26] <%Kiyosuki> Cait Sith is going to be so crazy gameplay wise.
[1:51:28] <+PlagueOfGripes> you'll see a lot of chests. you're here for... a while.
[1:51:30] <%Hoot_Patoots> @SH1NK1R0 i saw him beat that last summon solo earlier and that was crazy
[1:51:31] <%boogaleeboo> "Do a dungeon"
[1:51:33] <%BubbaRands> CHEST PogChamp
[1:51:33] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Go fuck yourself Hojo.
[1:51:34] <%Guardiansaiyan> @TheAntitype architectual engineering?
[1:51:37] <%Doctadaking> Gotta stretch that playtime out, I guess
[1:51:39] <%PocketChange117> Does Hojo have a lisp almost?
[1:51:40] <%hzealot> this section is very cool, and also, very dumb
[1:51:42] <%spiritofmojave> Hojo's voice does sound super familiar
[1:51:44] <%valriot> "I need you to extend the games duration"
[1:51:54] <%rufus2k2> @Nobrev yeah from what I remember he was trying to push her away and if she had left the noose he kept in the backroom would've had a new dance partner
[1:51:55] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Hojo wants you all to KISS
[1:51:59] <%rufus2k2> and she knew that
[1:52:01] <%radiocrawler> The only thing annoying by this section is waiting on Red all the time.
[1:52:02] <%Meow0369> Such a lust for data!
[1:52:03] <%ringabal> Square got Vexen's VA to do Hojo
[1:52:05] <%Keyd00d> It's certainly not very exciting
[1:52:06] <+PlagueOfGripes> "testing" = gotta hit 80 hours
[1:52:07] <%TsunamiPoro> yes
[1:52:07] <%Dragon_Batman> This is a really nice work for the choose your party in the og
[1:52:08] <%mankeyfigh> TIME FOR HOJO LAB FUCKERY
[1:52:09] <%코코꾸라> you have to
[1:52:09] <%crimsonphoenix69> YEP
[1:52:09] <%baronouroboros> THE HYPOTHESIS IS PROVED CORRECT mwuahahahHAHHAHA-- Hojo probably
[1:52:10] <%NitronStreams> PogChamp
[1:52:11] <%heartlesshealer> is he gonna try to force the red rocket still?
[1:52:14] <%amiroodude> YUS
[1:52:14] <%crimsonphoenix69> WELCOME TO THE DUNGEON
[1:52:18] <%sniffy77> Red that Data may involve u Nutting into one of the girls
[1:52:20] <%Kaask> worst part of the game yeah
[1:52:25] <%love_otter> So is backseating against the rules or not in that situation
[1:52:27] <%CelioHogane> NO, YOU REMOVED RED FROM THE PARTY!
[1:52:28] <%heartlesshealer> OH GOD ONE OF THESE
[1:52:29] <%Darkfire346> TITTY POWER
[1:52:31] <%cowardman93> this is why you wanted to materia everyone
[1:52:31] <%aBlueWizard> Don't send them where you can't see them. That's when they start to kiss
[1:52:31] <%BubbaRands> GRILL TEAM
[1:52:31] <%therealgirthman> "CLOUD! Put this dress on! The data it will provide is sure to be invaluable! vargDong "
[1:52:32] <%Dragon_Batman> I thought this section was great
[1:52:33] <%ScottishMadJacko> This such an interesting mechanc that will probably see refinement for the next games
[1:52:33] <%boogaleeboo> It's cool because of them all interacting
[1:52:35] <%Guardiansaiyan> @love_otter against unless asked
[1:52:37] <%SH1NK1R0> @celiohogane I’m torn tbh. I definitely want more things to fight and do before the second part releases but from a pr perspective it would not look good if they charged for anything given how the game is already being released
[1:52:38] <%GarbageQueenEllie> I feel like being a shipper is always being one step away from becoming Hojo
[1:52:38] <%hassanico2> WAS THAT AN MGS Coded noise?!
[1:52:39] <%mankeyfigh> kick
[1:52:41] <%Aracon_> more tifa hggGasm
[1:52:42] <%boogaleeboo> But like this didn't need to be a thing in the story, yeah
[1:52:44] <%hassanico2> Codec*
[1:52:44] <%valriot> Why peoeple calling this worst part of the game? Or are people just stupid and cant walk through the right door
[1:52:45] <%tigerfang86> NOPE
[1:52:45] <%ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt T&A together at last
[1:52:46] <+Remery_> Fight for Cloud
[1:52:47] <%de1ete_forever> yes, that was the MGS codec
[1:52:49] <%Excel83Gaming> MGS3 Sound!!
[1:52:49] <%spiritofmojave> Cloud and "ok" LUL
[1:52:50] <%DonatelloJose> WINK
[1:52:51] <%reinbachthe3rd> He's super not fine.
[1:52:51] <%Tearonex> PHS terminal makes a return
[1:52:52] <%GeneralSCPatton> I didn't mind when Boktai 2 did this with the Spiral Tower.
[1:52:53] <%BubbaRands> GO TEAM TIFAERITH
[1:52:53] <%ringabal> "Cloud's always been a dumb weirdo."
[1:52:54] <%logoth_> You're not fine Tifa

[1:52:56] <%Darkfire346> Aerith gettin IN there
[1:52:58] <%Meow0369> Can't wait for the bloodhound fight god I hope pat didn't level enough that he just breezes through it
[1:53:00] <%SGrim> Tifa sex?
[1:53:03] <@CreepyPorpoise> Hojo's VA is the same guy who played Jackie Chan in Jackie Chan Adventures
[1:53:05] <%KasiCrafter> "I'm fine" SMASH
[1:53:07] <+Remery_> More like Tifa's midsection <3
[1:53:09] <%Aracon_> his random migraines are fine tifa shut up :)
[1:53:09] <%aBlueWizard> people loved this shit in the final dungeon of ff6
[1:53:09] <%KawaiiJetty> Ha but it's Cloud 4Head

[1:53:13] <%startstoprepeat> smash 'em rip 'em intensifies
[1:53:15] <%TheAntitype> did pat take the elevator or the stairs when he entered the building?
[1:53:15] <%rufus2k2> BAD DAY BAD DAY BAD DAY!
[1:53:16] <%WanderTasogare> mini stroke lol
[1:53:16] <%MattzosoSA> @SoFarFetched Would it be better to just try Discord? I'm not looking for attention on stream or anything, so it's fine if he doesn't read it out loud. just knowing that he gets the message would be fine.
[1:53:16] <%aBlueWizard> and it's basically what they do in the final dungeon here.
[1:53:17] <%pureotome> LUL
[1:53:19] <%TimetodiveLTX> @CreepyPorpoise for real?
[1:53:20] <+PlagueOfGripes> Milker Crits and Magic Cheeks shall find the way to doggo
[1:53:20] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> and this is why the Tifa and Aerith shipping makes no sense. she loves Cloud. Cloud. that's the otp
[1:53:21] <%SummonerMagno> many things

[1:53:29] <%Story_Ark> "hey barrett, you think the girls are making out thinking of me?" "huh?!" "sorry, that was a strange thing to ask"
[1:53:31] <%spiritofmojave> @creepyporpoise OH SHIT

[1:55:03] <%213372bu> Final Fantasy 6 Phoenix Cave vibes of party switching
[1:55:06] <%valkuma> Zapping System Terminal
[1:55:06] <%conradical> is phs the thing you used to switch party members in the original?
[1:55:08] <%snugglepuggs> Use PHS
[1:55:10] <%de1ete_forever> zapping system
[1:55:11] <%PlainSimpleTailor> I don't get
[1:55:12] <%baronouroboros> This technology is unfamiliar
[1:55:13] <%spiritofmojave> that's the lamest joke
[1:55:14] <%rufus2k2> @conradical yup
[1:55:14] <%Guardiansaiyan> @conradical yes
[1:55:16] <%hassanico2> MGS3 Codec Noise

[1:55:20] <%arcielardor> PHS, Porn Hub Server?
[1:55:22] <%rufus2k2> and yes, that is the MGS3 radio noise
[1:55:25] <%CelioHogane> @CreepyPorpoise good thing is the Spanish dub had the Jackie Chan Dub Voice doing it, so we got the same voice!
[1:55:28] <+Remery_> With a hint of breeding research

[1:55:31] <%InfamousShephard> nice barret
[1:55:33] <%valriot> LUL just Cloud holding up Red tot the phone like "Oohhhhh does Reddy wanna talk to Tifa? Say hi to Tifa, booboo"
[1:55:33] <%therealgirthman> Hojo devoted his life to simping for alien mommy
[1:55:44] <%hotcarl6872> why do they know she is the cataclysm from the sky?
[1:55:46] <DKDiamantes> I still can't believe Red is the sam voice actor that does Ryuji
[1:55:46] <%kapcommunist> who does the dog sdound like a hunk
[1:55:51] <%Pyroclase> So is this the big upper part of the Shinra building you're in right now?

[1:56:05] <%preppyposs> REDS GONNA BLAB ABOUT THE PHANTOM THIEVES
[1:56:07] <%BubbaRands> A GOOD 66.6 PERCENT OF YOU ARE EXPERIMENTS
[1:56:11] <%hotcarl6872> Hojo and the others think she is an Ancient
[1:56:14] <%Dragon_Batman> This is Hojos lab in the like 64th floor @Pyroclase
[1:56:19] <%valriot> Man, Pats stupid sometimes
[1:56:19] <%CelioHogane> @therealgirthman he simped so hard he forced a woman had a child so he could inject Jenova cells into him to say he had a child with her.
[1:56:21] <%mankeyfigh> barret time
[1:56:29] <%heartlesshealer> that's more bullshit than status effects...
[1:56:39] <%de1ete_forever> Red is freaking out a bit
[1:56:40] <%kapcommunist> @GeneralSCPatton thats a hunk dog!
[1:56:41] <%Doctadaking> This is the worst enemy you could possibly test that move out on
[1:56:42] <%boogaleeboo> It's crazy how good wind elemental on his gun is
[1:57:09] <%213372bu> It's weird, point blank seemed to do no damage but Maximum Fury absolutely goes in
[1:57:19] <%Dragon_Batman> Almost like the name kinda descreibes it LUL
[1:57:20] <+PlagueOfGripes> yeah these enemies are irritating but not an issue
[1:57:31] <%Ipsenscastle> flawless
[1:57:43] <%Meow0369> @PlagueOfGripes did the bloodhounds kill you in your playthrough
[1:57:43] <%valriot> Point Blank does a sticky bomb after a few seconds
[1:57:44] <%reinbachthe3rd> Weird choice to not have Red XIII be a party member here.
[1:57:45] <%WritebroAlpha> What will he do?
[1:57:47] <%GohanHitsugaya> Lion
[1:57:48] <%rufus2k2> CALM
[1:57:48] <%KawaiiJetty> These enemies seem better than stupid eyeball mk2
[1:57:48] <%reinbachthe3rd> Doggy Style.
[1:57:48] <%mankeyfigh> nope
[1:57:48] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> so question, what is the point of Point Blank? Every time I've used it, I don't see much incentive to actually use it.

[1:59:27] <@DariusFTL> Aerith's probably holdin'
[1:59:29] <%Dragon_Batman> Right, all of em
[1:59:30] <%ringabal> If Aerith had a smartphone, would she be the type to post memes?
[1:59:33] <%valriot> ACTUALLY CANT COUNT
[1:59:34] <%valkuma> WHAT THE ??
[1:59:44] <%Meow0369> I wonder if that big door with the number 3 on it they need to go through has anything to do with it
[1:59:45] <%SH1NK1R0> Immediately opens wrong door
[1:59:46] <%WritebroAlpha> Aerith would be a big memer
[1:59:47] <%hassanico2> That AI voice sounds familiar
[1:59:48] <%Kiyosuki> @ringabal Absolutely
[1:59:52] <%mankeyfigh> nope
[1:59:52] <%hassanico2> Anyone know who it is?
[1:59:53] <%Metballs> Aerith would be the dankest memer
[1:59:53] <YakumoYomi> "Gonna open'em all up." "Nah, tho."
[1:59:54] <%WanderTasogare> sad life
[1:59:55] <%Aydarkzero> Play by Joho's rules
[1:59:57] <%CelioHogane> @ringabal she would troll horny dudes
[1:59:59] <%WritebroAlpha> Barret would be like "this weird frog looks crazy, like a Shinra experiment"
[2:00:06] <%UvBenServed> Aerith would post memes that don't even exist yet
[2:00:06] <%cowardman93> RE Lab voice

[2:00:09] <%TimetodiveLTX> ...wendy lee?

[2:00:25] <%WanderTasogare> like re2 remake almost, in the lab maybe
[2:00:25] <@CreepyPorpoise> Could be, Wendy Lee did additional voices in this game
[2:00:26] <%hzealot> aerith just stares at cloud and says no way friend and he just stares blankly
[2:00:27] <%valkuma> its a 40 hour game do you actually think this is padding
[2:00:28] <%valriot> Time to see if Pat uses Chi Trap or not
[2:00:28] <%cowardman93> @PatStaresAt it's the voice for the NEST AI in RE2 Remake
[2:00:30] <%GeneralSCPatton> @plagueofgripes Farmers mad ×24

[2:00:50] <+PlagueOfGripes> Nanaki is easily the best part of this section of the game
[2:00:50] <%Ipsenscastle> EGGS & CHIPS
[2:00:54] <%KawaiiJetty> big titty monster does not sound bad
[2:00:55] <%Story_Ark> farmers mad
[2:00:56] <%GarbageQueenEllie> So we all know Cloud's a weirdo, but what KIND of weirdo?
[2:00:58] <%valkuma> Tifa has to sheathe her legs every time she breaks open boxes
[2:01:02] <%heartlesshealer> well, I'm hoping Corneo just stole Abzu from Hojo
[2:01:02] <%tumzfestival> Why were we all stumbling over eachother hehe?
[2:01:07] <%Meow0369> I'm waiting with baited breath
[2:01:09] <%Guardiansaiyan> @GarbageQueenEllie edge lord variant

[2:01:24] <%de1ete_forever> ASS4DAYZ
[2:01:27] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @Guardiansaiyan Like a Vincent edgelord or a Jotaro edgelord?
[2:01:28] <%valriot> Ok nvm he should manage the dogs fine
[2:01:28] <%ringabal> Tifa teaching Aerith how to do an infinite
[2:01:28] <%heartlesshealer> YEYEYE
[2:01:30] <%Meow0369> Here it comes
[2:01:34] <%Ultimatefool> Chi Trap is JUST magnet from KH2
[2:01:34] <%213372bu> @hzealot It's doing a ff6
[2:01:35] <%therealgirthman> >tfw Tifa will never beat you up
[2:01:37] <%Hoot_Patoots> i forgot chi trap is a thing and it's pretty good too
[2:01:37] <%Aracon_> best gloves
[2:01:40] <%ringabal> David Cages
[2:01:41] <%SilverDevilfish> It's just Resident Evil
[2:01:42] <%CelioHogane> IT SMELLS LIKE SAD
[2:01:44] <%siamzero94> it's the resi 2 dog kennel
[2:01:46] <%Guardiansaiyan> @GarbageQueenEllie Vincent edgelord but pretending he has the experience
[2:01:47] <+PlagueOfGripes> store the children here

[2:01:51] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> wait till later, I lurve it.
[2:01:51] <%Pyroclase> It makes such good ambient music, doesn't it?
[2:01:55] <%heartlesshealer> death kennel...
[2:01:57] <%SilverDevilfish> this whole section is basically a mini Resident Evil game
[2:01:58] <%Hoot_Patoots> the game's music is just amazing
[2:01:58] <%GohanHitsugaya> Jenova...
[2:02:00] <%EthorXL> Thats such a nice thing, that if you don't realize that it's a hold prompt and let go, the game gives you a second of leeway where the character doesn't let go of the switch, allowing you to realize your mistake and go back to holding without the animation having to loop.
[2:02:01] <%Aydarkzero> thats some buildup
[2:02:03] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @Guardiansaiyan This data will be most valuable.
[2:02:04] <%Kiyosuki> The music in this game was just non stop on point
[2:02:04] <%WanderTasogare> jenova accents sprinkled about yea
[2:02:04] <%Robot_Nixon_> monkaS
[2:02:05] <%CelioHogane> IT'S RED FOUR
[2:02:06] <%sniffy77> Shinras orphanage
[2:02:09] <%tumzfestival> Is that a fucking buster arm?
[2:02:10] <%valriot> Time for the RE2 kennel
[2:02:10] <%Zombrocom> Kinda reminds of Mass Effect honestly
[2:02:10] <%Hoot_Patoots> look at this freaking resident evil
[2:02:12] <%BallerSwagBro9k> yep
[2:02:13] <%Guardiansaiyan> RE DOGGO
[2:02:15] <%Darkfire346> it just hit me that JENOVAs name matches up to Sephiroths theme song
[2:02:16] <%amiroodude> City, sewers, lab. Is this a resident evil?
[2:02:17] <%Malisin_Murder> monkaS

[2:04:06] <%MoraMiarty> honestly shouldn't the ghosts just swoop in when you're about to die and kill the mobs
[2:04:07] <%Ipsenscastle> no no no that's not how it happened
[2:04:07] <%heartlesshealer> Maybe switch characters the moment you pop Cure spells?
[2:04:08] <%Malisin_Murder> psaFist
[2:04:09] <+PlagueOfGripes> it's not a great room to be in
[2:04:09] <%baronouroboros> Hojo is that Umbrella scientist that changed employers after Raccoon city
[2:04:09] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Maybe respecc Materia? or use items
[2:04:09] <%BeatBo_2> @WritebroAlpha now that's what I call a BAD END
[2:04:09] <%tumzfestival> DAS ALOTTA DOGS
[2:04:10] <%Excel83Gaming> Use lots of fire here pat
[2:04:10] <%Doctadaking> Remember Aerith’s lighting attack

[2:04:11] <%Verd_254> doodDed doodDed doodDed
[2:04:12] <%hotcarl6872> time to go on easy mode
[2:04:13] <%valkuma> the room isnt that bad
[2:04:17] <%conradical> wait, i had to beat the hard version of that room?
[2:04:18] <%Mornaka> IT WAS A MOTHER FUCKER
[2:04:20] <%Guardiansaiyan> @MoraMiarty ghost have high expectations
[2:04:21] <%Aracon_> it's not that bad
[2:04:23] <%ratreborn> the rooms later are harder
[2:04:24] <%maenos2> ehhh, easy modo?
[2:04:25] <%Pyroclase> Just hit the dogs with the big sword, Pat
[2:04:26] <%BubbaRands> non are great
[2:04:28] <%StaceMcGate> magnify + blizzard solves it fast
[2:04:28] <%boogaleeboo> Chi is a great skill, be proactive with heals, melt shit fast
[2:04:31] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> just be good at the game, Pat.
[2:04:37] <%optimasmaximas> the room kinda after this sucks some serious balls
[2:04:37] <%Hoot_Patoots> this is a good room for barrier
[2:04:42] <%SH1NK1R0> The room hasn’t changed it’s the same as launch
[2:04:45] <%Keyd00d> Just use Aerith fuck beam
[2:04:48] <%LEMON_LIME_> Really? I didn't have a problem with this room on my first play through
[2:04:50] <%kaizerlith> Chi trap is so good for stagger.
[2:04:52] <%snugglepuggs> Patched
[2:04:54] <%conradical> i used Blizzaga and got lucky
[2:04:56] <%Dragon_Batman> Didn't have blizzard I'm guessing
[2:04:57] <%HunguyTV> Me neither
[2:04:58] <%kapcommunist> you can do it!
[2:05:00] <%YakumoYomi> This room is free. The latter room with the other party was much worse for me. You know the one...
[2:05:00] <%optimasmaximas> im guessing the person that said this meant another rrom
[2:05:02] <%de1ete_forever> crush fuck that doggo
[2:05:08] <%Aracon_> just abuse star shower
[2:05:09] <%HunguyTV> Just arcane ward blizz and its over

[2:05:12] <%optimasmaximas> @YakumoYomi i do indeed
[2:05:16] <%optimasmaximas> @YakumoYomi fuck that room
[2:05:19] <%Robot_Nixon_> I had prayer on tifa so I didnt have much trouble here.
[2:05:21] <%tumzfestival> More pressure
[2:05:23] <%Meow0369> There's a couple ways to cheese this fight but if you just brute force it it doesn't work out well
[2:05:28] <%hzealot> do the dogs heal?
[2:05:33] <%heartlesshealer> Yes they heal
[2:05:40] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Im afraid of the Rule 34 for this room
[2:05:51] <%Legato_Ambrose> It already exists, don't worry.
[2:05:51] <%BeatBo_2> How are these Doggos tougher than EVERYTHING else in this lab?

[2:06:28] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> I hope there's more magnify materia in Part 2.
[2:06:29] <%KasiCrafter> Borks busted.
[2:06:30] <%valkuma> @Meow0369 hes like 2 levels over, not a big deal
[2:06:30] <%hassanico2> Does Aerith get too many weapons for how little you can play her in late game?
[2:06:31] <%Ipsenscastle> @tumzfestival eyyy

[2:07:57] <%Robot_Nixon_> @VritraReiRei there are 2 asses here Kappa
[2:07:58] <%morningmoondude> once again Blanka is destroyed by zoners
[2:07:58] <%linSP> shouldn’t he be thirsty?
[2:08:02] <%weissguard> @doc_ock_rokc Nah man. Hojo would find a way to put the G-Virus into a Behemoth.
[2:08:03] <%ScottishMadJacko> no
[2:08:04] <+PlagueOfGripes> haha.
[2:08:04] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> no
[2:08:05] <%WritebroAlpha> This one's for you, Morph!
[2:08:05] <%siamzero94> no
[2:08:05] <%GohanHitsugaya> Nope
[2:08:05] <%Captain_Aham> no
[2:08:06] <%Alopekis> Uh
[2:08:07] <%CelioHogane> no

[2:08:08] <%Dragon_Batman> Build them all
[2:08:09] <%morningmoondude> lol nah
[2:08:09] <%pureotome> no
[2:08:09] <%Sir_stride> no
[2:08:10] <%arcaderabbit48> So do the enemies not stagger unless in Stagger? Cause looking at even basic doggos having hyper armor feels... bad.
[2:08:10] <%Quigsies> no
[2:08:10] <%Aydarkzero> starshower is a vacuum
[2:08:10] <%Guardiansaiyan> no
[2:08:10] <%thackattack00> no lmao
[2:08:11] <%SGrim> Haha. No.
[2:08:11] <%Dragon4234> no
[2:08:11] <%hzealot> NOPE
[2:08:13] <%Aracon_> no
[2:08:14] <%Aydarkzero> LUL
[2:08:14] <%valkuma> You never get to choose
[2:08:15] <%SH1NK1R0> Chi trap stun locks him
[2:08:15] <%GarbageQueenEllie> no Red?
[2:08:16] <%ringabal> It gets pretty nuts
[2:08:16] <%D3rrtyD4n> dont worry about it
[2:08:17] <%tumzfestival> Awww
[2:08:18] <%Explodincatz> u wish
[2:08:19] <%mankeyfigh> man the bladed staff is ass, it isn't even melee also no
[2:08:19] <%TheActuallyGuy> DEPENDS ON YOU AFFECTION
[2:08:21] <%hzealot> @PatStaresAt you thought this game would let you choose?
[2:08:22] <%boogaleeboo> Technically some of it is influenced by affection rating
[2:08:25] <%reinbachthe3rd> Cloud, Barett, Tifa - OG team.
[2:08:27] <%GohanHitsugaya> Equip them all with the best you got
[2:08:28] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> no picky. Tho the final confrontation party lineup DOES change depending on your dialogue choices in the past.
[2:08:29] <%42nfl19> Why not get asses on this Party for now?
[2:08:29] <%gespenst25> do you want to know?
[2:08:29] <%RPG_CHICAGO> YOU GOT 2/3 RIGHT
[2:08:29] <%Solid_Stro> Destiny will decide
[2:08:30] <+PlagueOfGripes> well, you CAN choose when using the shinra VR sim thing
[2:08:31] <%Alopekis> No but I'm convinced that there's some way to influence who you get that we don't know about.
[2:08:33] <%drfaustisdead> You'll understand when you get there.
[2:08:35] <%valkuma> @arcaderabbit48 there are Toppling moves and interrupting moves. basic attacks only interrupt basic bitch enemies
[2:08:39] <%kapcommunist> why so many people watching if they already played it
[2:08:40] <%valriot> >Not wanting Aerith. Now i know why you hate Black Mages, cant deal with their raw dps
[2:08:41] <%Aydarkzero> No CBT Team for you Pat
[2:08:45] <%snugglepuggs> No Random
[2:08:47] <%DJLavender> it won't be a problem for you then
[2:08:47] <%Kiyosuki> I was hoping the bladed staff would have a special moveset, like Spiked Bat or Barret's melee weapons
[2:08:48] <@SoFarFetched> @kapcommunist cause they wanna see pat's reaction.
[2:08:50] <%arcaderabbit48> @valkuma Okay, that's not too bad at least
[2:08:52] <%Aracon_> gee this won't go poorly at all Kappa
[2:08:52] <%mankeyfigh> WELP
[2:08:54] <%MattzosoSA> wait they actually brought back the affection system?
[2:08:55] <%Hoot_Patoots> look at these very solid pipes
[2:08:59] <%valkuma> @arcaderabbit48 if he used overpowere or other abilities or attacked from behind or with strong attacks, they get interrupt animations
[2:08:59] <%Meow0369> @kapcommunist What are you talking about we're not watching for only the game
[2:09:00] <%reinbachthe3rd> Stealth segments,
[2:09:01] <%de1ete_forever> Aerith push that bitch, there can be only ONE!
[2:09:04] <%shadowace2400> it's not
[2:09:05] <%maenos2> aeriths fat are breaking the pipe
[2:09:05] <%siamzero94> c'mon game we already know what's happening
[2:09:07] <%Robot_Nixon_> @kapcommunist because were lonely FeelsBadMan
[2:09:07] <+Remery_> Her big tiddies ruined it!
[2:09:08] <%WritebroAlpha> Tifa's tits too heavy for pipe

[2:09:15] <%reinbachthe3rd> Look at those Shinra building standards.
[2:09:16] <%rontopronto> Aerith can't Superhero Land
[2:09:17] <%Aydarkzero> oh Aerith LUL
[2:09:17] <%Legato_Ambrose> I beat it in a couple of days, but I can't wait to see Pat's reaction.
[2:09:18] <%shadowace2400> they're tryting to sneak
[2:09:19] <%mankeyfigh> this will hurt more
[2:09:20] <%Dayube> @kapcommunist that's stupid
[2:09:21] <%Daskolin> HALF HUMAn. HALF DOG
[2:09:21] <@DariusFTL> You've seen the inside of Mako Reactors, Shinra isn't big on safety regs.
[2:09:22] <%logoth_> stop it!
[2:09:24] <%ringabal> CUZ SHE'S DA EARTH GET IT
[2:09:26] <%Nobrev> I also died here a few times
[2:09:30] <%HunguyTV> Why would you watch someone else before you play it yourself if you even remotely care for the game :<
[2:09:31] <%morningmoondude> ouch Aerith ate that Blanka Ball in the face
[2:09:39] <%Guardiansaiyan> @DariusFTL like Umbrella
[2:09:42] <+Remery_> Don't be fooled, Aerith is hiding a big ass underneath that dress
[2:09:43] <%HunguyTV> Except if you dont have the system its on then sure
[2:09:49] <%Dragon_Batman> It's a great shield
[2:09:50] <%Darkfire346> Tifa should take off a titty and throw it like a grenade
[2:09:51] <%PanicSwytch> Did Pat finish the VR missions from the Shinra offices?
[2:09:53] <%Kiyosuki> that flower is busted
[2:09:56] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah Im waiting for PC for this.
[2:09:56] <%CelioHogane> @HunguyTV maybe they want to see the gameplay and don't care for the story?
[2:09:59] <%Kiyosuki> I love it
[2:09:59] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> god, Aerith is ALWAYS cumming, and Tifa STILL hasn't gotten that shower.
[2:09:59] <%linSP> Are these red 1 and red 9

[2:10:09] <%MonsterEnvy> Use Aerith's massive amounts of magic

[2:10:10] <%Dragon_Batman> @PanicSwytch No he is gonna wait to do it after
[2:10:14] <%mankeyfigh> why isn't Aerith you white mage???
[2:10:22] <%Aydarkzero> monkaS

[2:10:40] <%Malisin_Murder> psaSkelmo
[2:10:40] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> you should probably mix up your materia a bit.
[2:10:41] <%hotcarl6872> maybe put cure on Aerith
[2:10:41] <%amused_platypus> mauled to death
[2:10:41] <%luftraumm1> pat needs to learn how to give commands and switch out chrcters
[2:10:42] <%love_otter> Do enemies scale with you? Cuz christ you ground to 35
[2:10:42] <%TheActuallyGuy> NOT EVEN ON A BOSS FIGHT

[2:10:43] <%EuropanLamprey> THE POWER OF GRIND CAN'T SAVE YOU NOW
[2:10:43] <%baronouroboros> Game over man
[2:10:44] <%WritebroAlpha> Goddamn

[2:10:46] <%morningmoondude> How does it ffeel to die to Blanka?
[2:10:46] <%siamzero94> even i didn't die here and i'm shit at this game
[2:10:48] <%narusao> start back at the beginning
[2:10:48] <%therealgirthman> Maybe Pat needs to play on easy mode Kappa
[2:10:48] <%DJLavender> I think your materia loadout need some work
[2:10:49] <%TrueSpartan14> Yeah the Tifa and Aerith team up is not great
[2:10:49] <%Alopekis> Shoot them with the gun
[2:10:51] <%optimasmaximas> sure sure sure
[2:10:51] <%baronouroboros> GAME OVER
[2:10:51] <%heartlesshealer> nah
[2:10:52] <%Darkfire346> Game over YEAAAAAH
[2:10:52] <%Aydarkzero> guess it was a good idea for me to be here at 45 LUL
[2:10:52] <%Dragon_Batman> Maybe build for both
[2:10:53] <%cvp5127> arent you overleveled?
[2:10:53] <%Robot_Nixon_> But Tifa tho
[2:10:53] <%Cburg91> Is somebody counting deaths yet?
[2:10:53] <%GarbageQueenEllie> maybe respecc
[2:10:53] <%PocketChange117> Johns

[2:10:54] <%RoggleJr> You got this Pat!
[2:10:54] <%GohanHitsugaya> Sure, that's it...
[2:10:56] <%Meow0369> Big grind countered by big team swap
[2:10:58] <%42nfl19> @PatStaresAt Might as well get Asses on them temporarily
[2:10:58] <%Dragon4234> PJSalt
[2:11:02] <%optimasmaximas> nah this fight just sucks ass @PatStaresAt
[2:11:02] <%valkuma> i struggled the hardest on the Plate Tower because it was Cloud Solo and he is a pure dps
[2:11:03] <%narusao> pat totally meant to do that
[2:11:04] <%valriot> Just dont take damage Kappa
[2:11:04] <%conradical> magic is good
[2:11:04] <%mankeyfigh> You really want pray
[2:11:05] <%Explodincatz> welcome to the new FF7
[2:11:06] <%de1ete_forever> damn u zapping system!
[2:11:06] <%heyitskevin> No more Easy mode huh?
[2:11:08] <%rufus2k2> HEAL UP FIRST
[2:11:09] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> respec yo materia, foo, if you havin trouble.
[2:11:11] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Kick their asses!
[2:11:12] <%hzealot> good thing the game lets you get normaled out of your heals and ATB usages and you dont even get it back
[2:11:14] <%lord_traxis> You can just switch up your materia before walking into the fight
[2:11:15] <%j0ustar> Pat "I'm overleveled I'm not worried!" Boivin
[2:11:15] <%MonsterEnvy> That sounds like a good idea If you swap characters to heal aggro will shift
[2:11:17] <%richmon_> wwe beating this tomorrow bois?
[2:11:19] <%therealgirthman> Pat all you have to do is shoot them until they die
[2:11:20] <%baronouroboros> EASY MODE IS NOW SELECTABLE
[2:11:21] <%boogaleeboo> He'll heal when he's dead! Wait, what?
[2:11:22] <%tumzfestival> Tifa's FATASS
[2:11:23] <%RetroCop87> Pat is an old man now, he can't handle gaming
[2:11:31] <%heartlesshealer> prob not if Pat keeps his healing habits
[2:11:31] <%Meow0369> @richmon_ There's not much left
[2:11:32] <%therealgirthman> Tifa
[2:11:32] <%valkuma> hzealot except normals dont interrupt , they were doing strong attacks
[2:11:32] <%Aracon_> just mash :)
[2:11:33] <%Alopekis> @richmon_ If not today, then definitely tomorrow.
[2:11:35] <%GohanHitsugaya> Are we beating up on the birthday boy?
[2:11:44] <+Remery_> I hate how the moment you switch characters they immediately take agro. Like switch to Aerith and everything targets and fucks her
[2:11:50] <%GohanHitsugaya> Naw
[2:11:50] <%Kirby_Sauce> those sounds...
[2:11:51] <%siamzero94> blanka ball has a hitbox in the back? that's stupid
[2:11:54] <@SoFarFetched> He's probably gonna beat it today if he's planning to take tomorrow off.
[2:11:55] <%MattzosoSA> @RetroCop87 pls no. I'm next in line if that's the case
[2:11:57] <%HunguyTV> alright peeps, wasn't an agressive statement but sure
[2:12:00] <%valriot> "I shall summon this shield, against these melee enemies"
[2:12:07] <%cowardman93> yeah remake wants to give everyone their time to shine so speccing for a certain time will no longer work, they seem to actively not want to have people just make their 3 person super team
[2:12:08] <%boogaleeboo> There he goes
[2:12:10] <%hzealot> @valkuma im being hyperbolic but the idea that you can just get smacked and have your gauges eaten is so silly
[2:12:13] <%narusao> GET EM
[2:12:13] <%Ipsenscastle> whoa I didn't believe people when they said Aerith had a big ass but that shot on the pipe showed she has RIDICULOUS hips
[2:12:15] <%amused_platypus> its like the game expects you to know how to play
[2:12:17] <%valriot> PRESS. BUTTON.
[2:12:22] <%narusao> LUL
[2:12:22] <%de1ete_forever> DO COMBO
[2:12:22] <%Dragon_Batman> Weaknesses and changing controlled characters often helps
[2:12:30] <%valkuma> @hzealot you do the exact same thing to the enemies though, you can interrupt spellcasts and their special abilities
[2:12:35] <%siamzero94> USE MAGIC!
[2:12:38] <%tumzfestival> PAT DO COMBO?
[2:12:40] <%boogaleeboo> They are total bullshit with their interrupts to be fair
[2:12:40] <%luftraumm1> to be fair it's been quite while since playing with aeris
[2:12:40] <%Kirby_Sauce> is the shield directional?
[2:12:41] <%Doctadaking> Only works well for projectiles, Pat
[2:12:43] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> yeah, assessing sure does help, huh?
[2:12:50] <%RAAAAAINMAKER> Protip if you use Stop on somebody that's staggered, the stagger bar freezes (Only works on those without Stop immunity)
[2:12:54] <%Alpha8087> The shield does seem directional
[2:12:57] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @Ipsenscastle the dress hides it a little
[2:12:58] <%heartlesshealer> yay chakra
[2:13:01] <%WanderTasogare> tifa da stagger queen
[2:13:10] <%valkuma> Tifa is such a goddamn powerhouse i love her
[2:13:11] <+Remery_> @Ipsenscastle yea she hides her giantic ass underneath her dress like princess peach in smash
[2:13:13] <%valriot> Its Haste
[2:13:17] <%Ipsenscastle> @GarbageQueenEllie for sure, I assumed she was a stick
[2:13:18] <%tumzfestival> Doubled Ended
[2:13:21] <%TimetodiveLTX> don't press buttons on tifa's blockstring
[2:13:23] <%Dragon_Batman> Yea it never hurts to get an ability
[2:13:24] <%Guardiansaiyan> @Remery_ dam
[2:13:24] <%Metballs> Free ATB is real good tho
[2:13:25] <%Ultimatefool> Yes it's fucking stupid strong
[2:13:25] <%ScottishMadJacko> Oh right, thats why your damage was trash, that bladed staff
[2:13:26] <%mankeyfigh> not really, compared to the mythril staff...
[2:13:27] <%KasiCrafter> Pat HATES free ATB.
[2:13:30] <%heartlesshealer> ?
[2:13:42] <%Alopekis> Free ATB is poopy
[2:13:43] <%boogaleeboo> It's an amazing skill
[2:13:43] <%Kirby_Sauce> it's not free
[2:13:44] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @Ipsenscastle She would kill it in some yoga pants, hot damn
[2:13:44] <%YakumoYomi> Judgement Ray is sick
[2:13:46] <%valkuma> the FLower Barrier skill is trash anyway
[2:13:46] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> I know how it is.
[2:13:49] <%hzealot> @valkuma but the enemies at least generate their gauge constantly, your party's barely fills up over time
[2:13:51] <%CelioHogane> 100% COMPLETIONISM
[2:13:52] <+Ms_NoOne> Ms_NoOne subscribed at Tier 1. 
[2:13:52] <%코코꾸라> Isn't Reinforced better though?
[2:13:52] <%Kirby_Sauce> it comes from your meter
[2:13:55] <%heartlesshealer> empty materia slot
[2:13:59] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> mhm.
[2:14:06] <%valriot> No, its not when you use it against melee enemies
[2:14:08] <%optimasmaximas> i like the final barret weapon
[2:14:09] <%ringabal> Only blocks one way
[2:14:10] <%Doctadaking> It’s for projectiles
[2:14:12] <%Dragon_Batman> It is on some enemies and stops projectiles
[2:14:12] <%mankeyfigh> Pat against ranged enemies it's god tier
[2:14:13] <%Meow0369> I prefer the laser beam attack
[2:14:14] <%Nobrev> I liked the reinforced rod better personally. but mythril is good too
[2:14:14] <+Remery_> it lasts long and looks pretty tho
[2:14:17] <%PhysicsLB> you have an empty slut
[2:14:17] <%tumzfestival> Yeeeah
[2:14:17] <%GohanHitsugaya> I think it makes your attacks stronger...
[2:14:20] <%hotcarl6872> its mainly for ranged attacks
[2:14:22] <+PlagueOfGripes> after spending a lot of time with Aeris, I'm still not really impressed with her. aside from the doom laser
[2:14:23] <%luftraumm1> probably very situational
[2:14:24] <%Verd_254> it does nothing for melee. its amazing vs projectiles
[2:14:24] <%RetroCop87> Do the ATB and Casting fields stack?
[2:14:27] <%Ipsenscastle> @GarbageQueenEllie you have great taste
[2:14:31] <%RAAAAAINMAKER> Flower barrier blocks projectiles and keeps enermies away, it's notshellorprotect
[2:14:32] <%valkuma> @hzealot true but your main character generates ATB way faster than enemies do and you can manipulate aggro by swapping characters. its why barret pounds so much ass in this
[2:14:34] <%GohanHitsugaya> If they go through the barrier...
[2:14:36] <%DXLelouch24> Its amazing your just not using it correctly
[2:14:37] <%WritebroAlpha> Pat open the other shutter behind you
[2:14:40] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LUL
[2:14:40] <%Sir_stride> @plagueofgripes same. tempest is ok tbo
[2:14:41] <%Kiyosuki> flower barrier can trap some enemies
[2:14:42] <%42nfl19> Can you possible skip this fight or is it forced?
[2:14:43] <%tumzfestival> MEGA POTION BROTHER?
[2:14:45] <%Sir_stride> tho*
[2:14:51] <Kain5707> @RetroCop87 yup
[2:14:51] <%realm_forge> Welcome back to pat yells at women
[2:14:51] <+Remery_> Aeriths abilities last quite awhile almost through whole fights
[2:14:51] <%MoraMiarty> what was the plan here? the ladder would have put them in harms way anyway
[2:14:52] <%siamzero94> yes
[2:14:52] <%Kiyosuki> if you get them in the corner its pretty funny
[2:14:54] <%valriot> omg..
[2:14:55] <%heartlesshealer> Pat destroying his empty slot goblin psaUp
[2:14:59] <%GohanHitsugaya> Yes, get chest
[2:14:59] <%de1ete_forever> Snap into a SLIM JIM
[2:15:02] <%reinbachthe3rd> Pat's too good for Mega Potions now.
[2:15:04] <%WanderTasogare> what!?
[2:15:10] <%valriot> watch it be an ether
[2:15:10] <%Sir_stride> nani
[2:15:11] <%Robot_Nixon_> PogChamp
[2:15:12] <%Alopekis> Neato
[2:15:12] <%startstoprepeat> cleverly hidden chest
[2:15:15] <%Meow0369> wat
[2:15:15] <%Nobrev> Aerith excells with support. I actually play as her the most when she's in the party
[2:15:18] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> He better be if he wants to do Hard MOde
[2:15:20] <%Alopekis> Now you can use the force
[2:15:22] <%Dragon_Batman> you guys never checked?
[2:15:24] <%valkuma> yellow chests arent even worth opening because of hardmode though
[2:15:25] <%RAAAAAINMAKER> You shouldreally startburning all your items if you're doing a Hard mode run next
[2:15:26] <%Robot_Nixon_> We Jedi now PogChamp
[2:15:28] <%Aydarkzero> ew low stats
[2:15:29] <%213372bu> Tifa's Triangle can be a 1 hit ko to scrubs, Barrets fills atb etc. Aerith's tempest is really weird in comparison
[2:15:32] <%luftraumm1> thirds section it's quite cool
[2:15:34] <%mankeyfigh> eww
[2:15:35] <%Sir_stride> @dragon_batman no?
[2:15:37] <%WanderTasogare> fukin christ now i gotta go back and get that shit
[2:15:40] <%MoraMiarty> I'm wondering what the four slot equivalent is gonna be still
[2:15:47] <%linSP> Jedain’t
[2:15:48] <%MoraMiarty> cause so much has four slots already
[2:15:57] <%Robot_Nixon_> PunOko
[2:15:57] <%valkuma> 213372bu Aeriths triangle is worthless in comparison. her regular attack is AOE and can fill atb instantly if theres multi target
[2:15:58] <@DariusFTL> Hojo wasn't looking, you have to go back through
[2:16:00] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> I'd actually save the Hard Mode run of the story till AFTER you've done the final secret boss.
[2:16:00] <%Kiyosuki> She's just good with casting in general, Aerith with magic up, magnify+one of the element materias and she just clears rooms in seconds
[2:16:02] <%Nupinoop296> mood
[2:16:04] <%optimasmaximas> yeah....
[2:16:05] <%D3rrtyD4n> lol
[2:16:06] <%Alopekis> That is pretty weird
[2:16:06] <%Nupinoop296> i hate him too
[2:16:06] <%코코꾸라> LUL
[2:16:06] <%optimasmaximas> fuck hojo
[2:16:08] <%narusao> LUL
[2:16:09] <%MattzosoSA> I can't assume empty slots are bad though, right? If it's like the original, too much materia will hurt your stats.
[2:16:10] <%Dragon_Batman> @Sir_stride It's fair I thought people would check just in case
[2:16:10] <%mankeyfigh> yesss let the hate flow through you
[2:16:12] <+Remery_> And wanted to Breed you
[2:16:13] <%Kirby_Sauce> it's cause he stinky
[2:16:14] <%hzealot> huck fojo
[2:16:16] <%Quigsies> cum jar hojo
[2:16:17] <%Malisin_Murder> Cause you're a baby
[2:16:22] <%Explodincatz> because you were jerking off
[2:16:22] <%morningmoondude> the science jar, it's like the cum jar but with more dna
[2:16:22] <%Robot_Nixon_> Im not the only one! That poof is fucking startling
[2:16:24] <%tumzfestival> Is Tifa's skirt cut ABOVE her fingertips?..... I don't know about this
[2:16:31] <%Doctadaking> Flower is good for these
[2:16:32] <+PlagueOfGripes> Hojo keeps Ifalna's bone dust in pixie sticks
[2:16:32] <%YakumoYomi> Ray of Judgement works great on stationary targets like turrets.
[2:16:35] <%espanishcanamurciana> Heyyyy Pat, Elhmo, Phaige and Chat (the best chat in the country)
[2:16:43] <%DXLelouch24> @mattzososa it isnt
[2:16:46] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Aerith support and Tifa tank is a good combo, or it would be if Aerith didn't constantly aggro for no reason
[2:16:48] <%DJLavender> yeyeye punch those missle turrets!
[2:16:49] <%CelioHogane> @tumzfestival she wears shorts too
[2:16:50] <%logoth_> This ones for you morph
[2:17:06] <%WanderTasogare> kink shaming hojo lol
[2:17:07] <%Verd_254> they did a really good job making hojo a good version of an over the top villian. he comes across like a god damn lizard person.
[2:17:10] <%tumzfestival> PHEW LUL ;)
[2:17:17] <%TimetodiveLTX> YRC'd
[2:17:18] <%Guardiansaiyan> ....
[2:17:18] <%luftraumm1> oof aerith is buff as hell as a caster eh
[2:17:20] <%TsunamiPoro> pat hates women confirmed
[2:17:23] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> saving throww
[2:17:23] <%Persona_EX> WHAT?
[2:17:23] <%YakumoYomi> SAVED
[2:17:25] <%heartlesshealer> HMM
[2:17:26] <%valkuma> Hojo's face even kinda has a lizard people beneath it
[2:17:26] <%reinbachthe3rd> "Worked up a good sweat." Kreygasm
[2:17:29] <%Jumpie8> Plague already try looking up their skirts and found out it's just voids under there
[2:17:32] <%luftraumm1> nat 20
[2:17:40] <%Guardiansaiyan> @Jumpie8 damn
[2:17:43] <%BallerSwagBro9k> DID YOU?
[2:17:47] <+Remery_> I though Tifa was wearing spats underneath
[2:17:52] <%indig0bird> If Pat hates women, why does he touch them when he punches them? Atheists destroyed *smug face*
[2:17:54] <%Dragon_Batman> She is
[2:17:56] <%Ipsenscastle> @Jumpie8 oops all voids
[2:17:58] <%ScreamLord> Wow, Aerith's Limit bat fills of almost instantly
[2:17:58] <%tumzfestival> As long as he was giggling boyishly I think its fine
[2:18:04] <%GohanHitsugaya> Spats are hot...
[2:18:04] <%Pyroclase> 'cause she's having fun
[2:18:05] <%Axellogic> Tifa is speed
[2:18:05] <%Nupinoop296> skipping is fun
[2:18:05] <%ringabal> She got pep
[2:18:06] <%heartlesshealer> BYE ALT PATH
[2:18:06] <%Meow0369> You'd be happy if you were her
[2:18:08] <%SvenHolgersson> Either its spats or commando
[2:18:09] <%DJLavender> Pat: "i'm finally getting the hang of these characters at the end of the game."
[2:18:09] <%maenos2> hojo looks like a slimmer version of that alien human dude in xcom 2 who also looks like a slimmer version of otakon and hal emmerich
[2:18:11] <%VritraReiRei> whats a waaacharacter? 🤔
[2:18:13] <%kapcommunist> i would like to see an angry skip
[2:18:14] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @Jumpie8 Which is odd, you'd think Japan would be all over that upskirt stuff here
[2:18:16] <%Persona_EX> she's never skipped before so she just copies aerith @PatStaresAt
[2:18:17] <+Remery_> Spats needs more play

[2:18:36] <%tumzfestival> <3 plague
[2:18:38] <%maenos2> not hal
[2:18:43] <%Aracon_> red 13 is such a good boy
[2:18:46] <%heartlesshealer> Pat will get chests in hard mode probably
[2:18:48] <%DXLelouch24> Hard Mode will force Pat to master the other characters
[2:18:48] <@mothmandraws> this feels like how they will handle the full team in later games instead of having like 8-9 people running in a group all game
[2:18:50] <%weissguard> You ain't wrong @Remery_
[2:18:53] <%DXLelouch24> Or he will die
[2:18:54] <%YakumoYomi> Much like riding a jetski, it's impossible to be angry while skipping

[2:18:59] <%MattzosoSA> Sup, Paige

[2:19:31] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> @mothmandraws Honestly, I kinda like that it forces you to use different team builds instead of leaving the choice of who your party members will be.

[2:19:40] <%Dragon_Batman> I mean this is the first time in game that there is more than just 3 party members, and in the og you just choose who you want, this is kinda a happy medium I think

[2:20:41] <%weissguard> Oh hey. It's that room from the beginning of Metroid: Other M
[2:20:45] <%Guardiansaiyan> @SoFarFetched how to cook it tho?
[2:20:45] <%kapcommunist> zoark?
[2:20:48] <%GeneralSCPatton> Every day Pat eats 5 dozen eggs, so he's roughly the size of an ORB
[2:20:48] <%Faustgesicht> Cool, Twitch was fucking glitching out
[2:20:48] <%realm_forge> Do it on stream with your shirt off
[2:20:49] <%MoraMiarty> Me? Ghenghana!
[2:20:53] <+PlagueOfGripes> their excuse that everything is something Shinra made is going to start falling apart once you leave the Kalm area
[2:20:53] <%Ipsenscastle> @SoFarFetched just gargle it all together for optimal efficiency
[2:21:02] <%heartlesshealer> Counterstance gained
[2:21:05] <%reinbachthe3rd> NO HOOMAN
[2:21:10] <%DappercatEsquire> fucking hate those whack a mole fucks
[2:21:15] <%Doctadaking> Counterstance just melts certain enemies
[2:21:20] <@SoFarFetched> @Guardiansaiyan if he gets angry enough his blood will boil and cook it.
[2:21:22] <%Alopekis> Check
[2:21:26] <%richmon_> these blanka spawn
[2:21:31] <%Robot_Nixon_> Shinra made the Hell riders too Kappa
[2:21:32] <%Meow0369> Oh yeah *that* fight
[2:21:33] <%Mornaka> I choose to believe their name is pronounced Ze-nay-nay
[2:21:34] <%majindusto> Counterstance is THE BEST!!!!
[2:21:41] <%CelioHogane> @PlagueOfGripes why would anything that Shinra didn't do INSIDE a Shinra building?
[2:21:46] <%baronouroboros> But seriously cloud should've got proper swords, not these physics breaking monstrosities
[2:21:48] <+PlagueOfGripes> there's a sim version of those guys that's not a great time to fight
[2:21:49] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Would Monster be a Phoenix Down or an Ether?
[2:21:55] <%Dragon_Batman> Your barely using enemy skill
[2:22:00] <%baronouroboros> Buster sword is ugly
[2:22:02] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> That's right Pat, Lightning Ire and Fice
[2:22:07] <%CelioHogane> @baronouroboros his canon sword is a guant slab of metal
[2:22:08] <%Kiyosuki> no, physics breaking monstrosities pls
[2:22:12] <%DappercatEsquire> @meow0369 is there a better solution to them?
[2:22:13] <%Kiyosuki> make them bigger
[2:22:13] <%WanderTasogare> this game is missing custom materia load outs
[2:22:13] <%Doctadaking> Buster sword is awesome, shut up
[2:22:20] <%DXLelouch24> @garbagequeenellie an elixer that poisons you after
[2:22:21] <%Dragon_Batman> Elemental?
[2:22:22] <%heartlesshealer> empty slot on aerith
[2:22:26] <%valriot> NotLikeThis

[2:22:27] <%MalekDracarus> first strike
[2:22:27] <%hotcarl6872> first stike
[2:22:27] <%heartlesshealer> First Strike???
[2:22:29] <%Aracon_> oh god pat is getting lost in the menus
[2:22:30] <%valkuma> a greyed-out icon means its on a peice of gear he isnt equipping
[2:22:32] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @DXLelouch24 Been there
[2:22:33] <%ScottishMadJacko> I missed so much stuff that pat found lol
[2:22:33] <%Daisuke89> had the weaker elemntal
[2:22:34] <%hotcarl6872> first strike
[2:22:36] <%therealgirthman> @CelioHogane It was too big to be called a sword
[2:22:39] <%Meow0369> @DappercatEsquire Yeah, dodge the attack, it's got a lead up and obvious area of effect.
[2:22:39] <%Alopekis> Second Strike
[2:22:42] <%realm_forge> Heart
[2:22:43] <%burgerdicks> Gonna stream OG ff7 after this so all the young pissbabies know what was in the original?
[2:22:45] <%zarbudda77> elemental
[2:22:46] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> hm...warding linked to time might be good comin up
[2:22:50] <%RedKnightVI> I feel like saveable materia sets would be a good add for part 2
[2:22:50] <%maenos2> menu music
[2:22:56] <%Meow0369> @DappercatEsquire Not just backseat the exact combo of things you need every single fight eh
[2:22:58] <%Doctadaking> 1st strike and 3rd impact
[2:22:59] <%heartlesshealer> just give her the second Magic Up
[2:23:01] <%valriot> Age has taken its final toll on Pats brain cells
[2:23:02] <%de1ete_forever> hey, Beavis, look at all the slots
[2:23:03] <%baronouroboros> It's the Buster SLAB; not really a sword
[2:23:10] <%tuulu_t> !uptime
[2:23:10] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 23m.
[2:23:10] <%WanderTasogare> yea red knight
[2:23:18] <%Mornaka> @burgerdicks he already has
[2:23:18] <%Legato_Ambrose> I mean, pat's still gotta get back to OG eventually, right?.... R-right?
[2:23:20] <%D3rrtyD4n> pew pew
[2:23:24] <%Meow0369> Before?
[2:23:28] <%Meow0369> Mate he already shot it
[2:23:28] <%j0ustar> good try barret
[2:23:29] <%CelioHogane> BUT IS IT IFRITPROOF!?
[2:23:31] <%GohanHitsugaya> Fuck off Hojo!
[2:23:34] <%tigerfang86> HES HORNY

[2:23:38] <%weissguard> Okay Cloud, now test your Power Bombs.
[2:23:38] <%de1ete_forever> stop monologuing u bastard
[2:23:39] <%Foopoof> How effective is haste? I’ve always been too focused on not dying to notice the difference
[2:23:48] <%Meow0369> @Foopoof It's real good
[2:23:49] <%Doctadaking> What would change, Hojo?
[2:23:50] <%Alopekis> @Foopoof I like it
[2:23:50] <%Dragon_Batman> I do like that Hojo wants to experiment on Cloud
[2:23:51] <%heartlesshealer> gun?
[2:23:52] <@DariusFTL> the glass is Barretproof
[2:23:52] <%therealgirthman> Hojo has a GIGANTOR boner for Jenova
[2:23:52] <%Sir_stride> @foopoof its pretty good
[2:23:53] <%mankeyfigh> he's talking about Cloud
[2:24:02] <%heartlesshealer> this isn't Squall
[2:24:04] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Pat should start avoiding at gazing towards the chat soon, we got too many evil shits here
[2:24:05] <%maenos2> buster sword a gun apparently
[2:24:07] <%Quigsies> Gun huh
[2:24:08] <%MoraMiarty> is that glass? isn't it some kind of energy field
[2:24:08] <%pipboy344> How long until President’s office?
[2:24:09] <%valriot> Haste is good but a lot of buffs dont last long imo
[2:24:09] <%mankeyfigh> materia
[2:24:11] <%ringabal> Hojo trying to activate Cloud's Devil Trigger
[2:24:14] <%realm_forge> He has to live to research the plot ghosts?
[2:24:15] <%redlanternreviews> The most powerful gun, A sword
[2:24:18] <%Verd_254> gun doodMako
[2:24:24] <%Kiyosuki> Its not like, FFX game breaking good Haste but it's still really good
[2:24:25] <%luftraumm1> materia?
[2:24:28] <%Fenrirlives> DMC 4 flashbacks
[2:24:29] <%Malisin_Murder> psaLiz Only an asshole looks like Hojo
[2:24:29] <%CelioHogane> @ringabal dude just forgot Cloud isn't Vincent.
[2:24:30] <%tumzfestival> You thought it was a swrod FOOLED YOU.. BANG
[2:24:32] <%Laecerelius> What does the Buster Sword do in Gunslinger, Pat?
[2:24:34] <%DXLelouch24> Thats why you equip enchanted ring on your buffer
[2:24:35] <%Meow0369> So at what point do we emote only mode the chat
[2:24:39] <%tumzfestival> bleh
[2:24:39] <%Ipsenscastle> FF7 needs devil triggers, imagine Barrett and Tifa
[2:24:40] <%Alpha8087> I missed you SPhere grid
[2:24:50] <%majindusto> Don't worry about it...WORRYING INTENSIFIES!!!!
[2:24:52] <%Kiyosuki> If anyone's going to get devil trigger, its' Vincent
[2:24:53] <%rufus2k2> Upfraud
[2:24:54] <%valriot> Vincent has Devil Triggers
[2:24:54] <%Sir_stride> @kiyosuki christ is haste overpowered in that
[2:24:55] <%Keyd00d> Calm chat
[2:24:55] <%heartlesshealer> high magic def for zero slots
[2:24:58] <%baronouroboros> yeyeye, Royal Guard Tifa
[2:24:59] <%mankeyfigh> again?
[2:25:01] <%valriot> But theyre all stupid
[2:25:01] <%big_oki> yay!
[2:25:08] <%Kiyosuki> lol yeah Haste was so busted in X
[2:25:08] <%Mornaka> after he gets out of the lab is probably a good time for Emote mode
[2:25:09] <%valkuma> these MOTH units can fuck off
[2:25:09] <%Afterman_> keep that butthole tight
[2:25:10] <%Ipsenscastle> @Kiyosuki he absolutely has multiple Devil Triggers
[2:25:14] <%Doctadaking> Where do you get more Cog Bangles?
[2:25:16] <%RAAAAAINMAKER> Did he find the Chain bangle?
[2:25:18] <@mothmandraws> MOTHS are the most powerful
[2:25:21] <%Alopekis> It's cause he's round
[2:25:21] <%Kiyosuki> Like, Vincent was practically made to be a DMC character
[2:25:22] <%Robot_Nixon_> that's no Moth D:
[2:25:24] <%mankeyfigh> BARRET
[2:25:25] <%Meow0369> @Mornaka Sounds about right aye
[2:25:25] <%Kiyosuki> In an FF game
[2:25:32] <%Dragon_Batman> I don't think he found chain bangle yet
[2:25:34] <%Alpha8087> Give him lamp
[2:25:36] <%aBlueWizard> Stop trying to hit me, and hit me.
[2:25:38] <+PlagueOfGripes> elemental lightning on armor is good for moth units
[2:25:38] <%HunguyTV> Hey chat, did they ever fix the music loop on the ps4 version of og?
[2:25:39] <%valriot> Red tanking the itrate
[2:25:43] <%suikudo> Holy spark effects batman
[2:25:45] <%DappercatEsquire> @meow0369 fair enough, my bad
[2:25:47] <%Ipsenscastle> Vincent is ahead of the game entirely, he has FRANKENSTEIN TRIGGER
[2:25:48] <%Hoot_Patoots> this enemy is so scary on hard
[2:25:51] <%maenos2> giev lämp
[2:25:53] <%Aracon_> pat think of counterstance as a royal guard, go for it right before you get hit
[2:26:00] <%Kiyosuki> He better have Frankenstein and Jason trigger
[2:26:01] <%Dragon_Batman> Just use it as much as you can
[2:26:01] <@mothmandraws> remember when vincent turns into a spooky blanket in advent children
[2:26:02] <%Aracon_> rather than anticipating a hit
[2:26:14] <%Meow0369> @DappercatEsquire Bloody hell that was a late response, how'd you even find my reply, it should've been swallowed by chat log
[2:26:17] <%RAAAAAINMAKER> ChainOr just edge closer to it in Punisher guardfor auto parry
[2:26:20] <%logoth_> Barret dont pile bunker red 13 please

[2:26:35] <%Axellogic> Barret talking shit while cloud patches up his wounds
[2:26:35] <%Dragon_Batman> A scumbag

[2:26:42] <%DXLelouch24> Pat should switch more, enemies aggro whoever your controlling the most
[2:26:43] <%valriot> Tags: Ugly Bastard

[2:26:52] <%machshop> damn bitch you live like this?
[2:26:53] <%Hoot_Patoots> Hojo fucked
[2:26:54] <%LandOfTheWay> what the fuck's your problem man? why you like this?
[2:26:54] <%ringabal> "As a child, I'd kick in other children's sandcastles."
[2:26:57] <%Dragon_Batman> Something tragic in his childhood maybe?
[2:26:58] <+PlagueOfGripes> Hojo is the Don Corneo of animal corpses
[2:27:02] <%sniffy77> He gets off to it
[2:27:04] <+Remery_> He torture a animal once and that turned him on
[2:27:04] <%averyoddjew> because it's his fffffffffffETISH
[2:27:06] <%GohanHitsugaya> Yes it does!
[2:27:06] <%weissguard> What's RIGHT with him?
[2:27:08] <%mankeyfigh> it bad
[2:27:09] <%Alopekis> ACTUALLY it's incredible
[2:27:12] <%boogaleeboo> No it's not great
[2:27:13] <%Dragon_Batman> It's decent
[2:27:13] <%therealgirthman> Hojo just wants to live a quiet life
[2:27:15] <%heartlesshealer> =)
[2:27:15] <%Robot_Nixon_> ACKSHULLY
[2:27:15] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Actually its incrediblr
[2:27:15] <%GohanHitsugaya> It sucks so bad!
[2:27:15] <%213372bu> Maximum Fury is super perfect especially with critical hits
[2:27:15] <%SvenHolgersson> ACKSUALLY
[2:27:16] <%Ultimatefool> UM ACTUALLY
[2:27:16] <%worldbrand> monka fucking s at that one guy
[2:27:17] <%CanadianAnimatorGuy> Actually it sucks ass!
[2:27:17] <%Aracon_> it's good when an enemy is staggered :)
[2:27:17] <%StaceMcGate> ACTUALLY its incredible
[2:27:18] <%amiroodude> no its bad
[2:27:18] <%kaizerlith> I couldn't learn point blank until new game plus because team kept pulling enemies away from him.
[2:27:19] <%Felto3> its better with more atb charges
[2:27:20] <%Buzzard42> psa1guy
[2:27:21] <%Metballs> It's ok, but it's no Max Firy
[2:27:21] <%valkuma> maximum fury and focused shot are better in every way
[2:27:22] <%coreyyotto> It's good damage for 1 ATB bar
[2:27:24] <%Persona_EX> he's basically sephiroths dad so he's gotta be super fucked
[2:27:25] <%Tearonex> IT;S HIS BEST MOVE
[2:27:26] <%XeroSigmaPrime> IT DOES SOOOOOO MUCH DMG
[2:27:26] <%Treuan> Actually it's incredibly bad
[2:27:27] <%CelioHogane> HOJO CLEARLY BECAME CRAZY BECAUSE HE WAS THE ONLY UGLY HUMAN BEING ON THIS BISHI BISHI BREAKY BREAKY WORLD
[2:27:30] <%Mornaka> it does a good amount of damage with the explosion
[2:27:30] <%hotcarl6872> best used on staggered enemies for big damage
[2:27:33] <%DappercatEsquire> @meow0369 got distracted, you right though, should let him just do the thing
[2:27:33] <%Verd_254> psa1guy actually
[2:27:35] <%Dragon_Batman> Those 2 yes
[2:27:36] <%Kiyosuki> It's ok but Max Fury, Stoneskin, Lifesaver are leagues ahead
[2:27:37] <%mankeyfigh> It's only useful in specific situations AND NOT BOSSES
[2:27:40] <%rumtumtugnutz> Point Break? Maybe if it summoned Bodhisatva
[2:27:40] <%lord_traxis> If it isn't Maximum Fury it isn't shit
[2:27:41] <%Dayube> it has a secondary explosion
[2:27:47] <%RAAAAAINMAKER> Furious Max is the bomb

[2:29:09] <%valriot> ROCK HARD
[2:29:09] <%acecondeuce> ROCK HARD
[2:29:10] <%averyoddjew> fucking hate these things
[2:29:14] <%Kiyosuki> lol I was just waiting for the whack a moles
[2:29:15] <%redlanternreviews> Catdog got cheated out of doing cool shit
[2:29:18] <%Rafferty3231> I will never and have never played this game and I already intensely hate the whack-a-moles
[2:29:19] <%GohanHitsugaya> He a lion! It's rip Kitty!
[2:29:22] <%Doctadaking> Not looking forward to these guys in hard mode
[2:29:26] <%heartlesshealer> Pat, they brought back Hell House. Of course the whack-a-moles are here
[2:29:29] <%NovaKnightmare> You trained for this, Pat!
[2:29:35] <%MAX116030> Square sure does a good job to make Hojo most hatable person in the world
[2:29:35] <%KawaiiJetty> Nice sense of humour with these enemies Kappa
[2:29:39] <%Spankminister> Hojo is literally the Nazi scientist meme "I will drown a man in freezing water to gain the valuable medical data that he drowned"
[2:29:49] <%Afterman_> god i ahte these enemies
[2:29:51] <%Wurmspawn> Isn't it great how you can't just roll under the doorway and leave?
[2:29:52] <%luftraumm1> that's just a xiv game mechanic
[2:29:53] <%Keyd00d> Where's my triceratops with wheels enemy
[2:29:56] <%MoraMiarty> these guys seem anti fun
[2:29:56] <%heartlesshealer> the center one's an ass
[2:30:03] <%RAAAAAINMAKER> This area is fine if you equip elemtnal lighting to armour to absorb their and MOTH unit blasts
[2:30:18] <%boogaleeboo> Pray is so good
[2:30:37] <%Kiyosuki> that looked cool at least
[2:30:39] <%Dragon_Batman> Yeaaa
[2:30:40] <%mankeyfigh> and for some goddam reason, they Poison
[2:30:41] <%Wurmspawn> Yeah but good luck getting an element materis up that high without exesive grinding before coming here.
[2:30:41] <%LittleBigQuebec> once leveled yea
[2:30:45] <%valkuma> pray is really good but Magnify Curaga though
[2:30:50] <%Doctadaking> Pray makes hard mode doable
[2:30:54] <+PlagueOfGripes> looks like you're loving it too
[2:30:59] <%geary28> thats not how you say counterstance
[2:30:59] <%worldbrand> it's the only thing that lets hard mode- yeah
[2:31:00] <%RAAAAAINMAKER> You just need level 2 to nulify elemental attacks
[2:31:00] <%Wurmspawn> negate most likely, but absorb is super
[2:31:02] <%valkuma> benches not regen MP in hardmode feels weird
[2:31:04] <%baronouroboros> dun dun dun dun, dun dun, dun dun dun!
[2:31:06] <%valriot> IT SUCKS HE SAYS
[2:31:12] <%Robot_Nixon_> Pray the injuries away
[2:31:12] <%mankeyfigh> thats a lotta damage
[2:31:13] <%heartlesshealer> exploded it with its own grenade <3
[2:31:16] <%doc_ock_rokc> Resident preacher Echoterrorist supports the power of pray
[2:31:17] <%rufus2k2> what
[2:31:18] <%Dragon_Batman> You don't know it has a second explosion do you?
[2:31:19] <%Kiyosuki> I had one of all four elements at level 3 by the time I got here and I didn't grind that much
[2:31:27] <%Nupinoop296> what was up with the other gun
[2:31:33] <%rufus2k2> isn't the gun he had better?
[2:31:37] <%Alazull> It is
[2:31:39] <%Wurmspawn> hit enter by accident, doesn't matter ewhat i was saying anyways.
[2:31:42] <%valriot> Its a sticky grenade with a 2nd explosion
[2:31:44] <%Alopekis> Pat's just a hater
[2:31:44] <%startstoprepeat> ekg with two maxed luck up materia is dope, wall of crits
[2:31:45] <%hahaha1171> point blank it practically melee
[2:31:45] <%hassanico2> Pat can you say Big Bertha in a funny way?
[2:31:47] <%Kiyosuki> Its the stategic magic and stat materia that was a grind bummer for me
[2:31:47] <%Dayube> I don't think he knows about the second explosion
[2:31:48] <%SH1NK1R0> He hasn’t noticed the secondary explosion or the massive damage it’s dealing a single time lol
[2:31:48] <%valriot> But Pat is blind
[2:31:49] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Pat, the 2nd explosion from EKG is like 5 seconds later and it FUCKS SHIT UP
[2:31:55] <%SvenHolgersson> Big Birth-Ah
[2:31:56] <%mankeyfigh> you have to be in melee range for it, which is the opposite of Barret
[2:31:56] <%Afterman_> bag borfa

[2:32:09] <+PlagueOfGripes> brain pod...? can't remember the name
[2:32:09] <%KawaiiJetty> Stupid pots
[2:32:11] <%GeneralSCPatton> Do you still get a duplicate materia after maxing them out?
[2:32:15] <%Alazull> Let him be wrong so very wrong
[2:32:17] <%mankeyfigh> no
[2:32:17] <%rufus2k2> pat heal the fuck up

[2:32:43] <%hzealot> how did hojo get in that chest room
[2:32:46] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> 2 Hi potions, 2 remedies!
[2:32:48] <%Alopekis> Berith and Toud
[2:32:49] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> chain baaangle
[2:32:50] <+Remery_> @hassanico2 autocorrect
[2:32:51] <%Wurmspawn> I had to look it up, but I could've sworn Red's voice actor was Garus till I found out otherwise.
[2:32:52] <@JustinianKnight> yea Brain Pod
[2:32:56] <%RAAAAAINMAKER> Chain bangle is the best
[2:32:57] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> best armor
[2:32:57] <%hzealot> magnify @doctadaking
[2:32:58] <%MalekDracarus> SO GOOD
[2:32:59] <%valriot> Actually the best item
[2:33:00] <%Kiyosuki> melee Barret is so much fun
[2:33:01] <%corgispudmen> is it just me or is there a phone ringing in the music
[2:33:02] <%SH1NK1R0> Best armor in game
[2:33:02] <%Alopekis> Chaingle
[2:33:04] <%hassanico2> @Wurmspawn yeah it's Ryuji's
[2:33:08] <%Excel83Gaming> Hmmm lots of remedies, sure seems like theyre setting you up for an enemy with lots of status attacks hmmmmmm
[2:33:09] <%GohanHitsugaya> You have to chain that bangle
[2:33:09] <%mrpheonix1212> i love how you still get usable items from chests and boxes in hard mode
[2:33:09] <%Kiyosuki> Even if gun Barret is generally more useful
[2:33:11] <%Dragon_Batman> @GeneralSCPatton Alot of them are just buyable, there is only a fixed amount for magnify and elemental I believe
[2:33:11] <%mankeyfigh> man who uses Barret's melee wapons? because power to you
[2:33:19] <%startstoprepeat> you get one chain bangle, enjoy it
[2:33:23] <%tumzfestival> hungry for some bangles
[2:33:25] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> It's free money.
[2:33:33] <%KasiCrafter> *slap* This baby can carry so much freakin Matria
[2:33:34] <+Remery_> Melee Barret just does a lot of crowdcontrol
[2:33:40] <%luftraumm1> magnify time?
[2:33:41] <Kain5707> @JustinianKnight um excuse me
[2:33:41] <%Kiyosuki> Melee barret can tear shit up

[2:36:22] <%GeneralSCPatton> @dragon_batman I was just thinking about the bullshit you could do in the original, where you max Knights of the Round several times, and equip it connected to all the modifiers, like multi-cast, counter, and on death.

[2:45:44] <%Ipsenscastle> that's how Woolie broke that guy's sternum
[2:45:45] <%luckysteak> It is too bad that magic is so bad they could not provide covering fire
[2:45:46] <+PlagueOfGripes> what a good, good boy
[2:45:46] <%aBlueWizard> Aerith's double cast ward makes some fights a damn joke.
[2:45:48] <%GohanHitsugaya> The shield seems like it makes your attacks stronger when they're shot through it.
[2:45:48] <%PocketChange117> The whole team got to see Tifa launch that fucker across the Drum
[2:45:54] <%gespenst25> yuh

[2:46:14] <%tumzfestival> I've seen the video of Woolie breaking a man's sternum
[2:46:15] <%ringabal> Hojo saw that shoulder check and said "God I wish that were me."
[2:46:15] <%GohanHitsugaya> But I may be imagining that
[2:46:18] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Tifa's fight against that one broad is gonna be a fucking joke
[2:46:19] <%boogaleeboo> "Don't you have a gun Barret?" "I forgot."

[2:47:06] <%j0ustar> Pat...
[2:47:06] <%Dragon_Batman> @GohanHitsugaya The shield is more for projectile stuff, and in certain situations can stop enemies from getting to you
[2:47:06] <%ringabal> PAIGE DID YOU DRUG THESE CANDIES
[2:47:06] <%GohanHitsugaya> Petting Red would let him know you're down to fuck

[2:55:47] <%WanderTasogare> jesus
[2:55:48] <%TimetodiveLTX> the thing with DMC3 is there's ways to make that fight go really fast, and most RPGs don't let you go into DT

[2:56:35] <%boogaleeboo> The payoff for this section makes it worth it

[2:56:37] <%LEMON_LIME_> holy shit she used thunder in mine

[2:57:57] <%spiritofmojave> BIG PEE
[2:57:59] <%boogaleeboo> Like for all that it's a padding dungeon it has cute character moments and barret and cloud are so stupid
[2:57:59] <%ringabal> Sephiroth taking MUTHER out for a stroll
[2:58:05] <%espanishcanamurciana> Hey guys Im' making a strawberry banana pb smoothie, who wants it w chocolate almond milk?
[2:58:11] <%WanderTasogare> candy bar was chocolate lax confirmed
[2:58:11] <%Dragon_Batman> @Darkfire346 Either this is suppose to happen or they can't stop him
[2:58:12] <%baronouroboros> I do
[2:58:13] <%Meow0369> @thebetterbard Big number = pat no use brain to play
[2:58:15] <%Typhaeon> Too many flavors
[2:58:18] <%Ipsenscastle> Pat needs to be checked for a UTI for real
[2:58:19] <%Solid_Stro> 7 degrees separation from muther DansGame
[2:58:19] <%RyanTheRecluse> the longer pat is on earth the stronger his incontinence grows
[2:58:25] <%luftraumm1> padding is important just watch rupauls drag race
[2:58:25] <%de1ete_forever> must be the work of an enemy stand
[2:58:28] <%arcielardor> Patrick "Thimble Bladder" Boivin
[2:58:35] <%boogaleeboo> tiny man tiny bag
[2:58:39] <%Doctadaking> This section pretty much replaces the party getting caught and thrown in the cells
[2:58:44] <%Ipsenscastle> T minus one month until Pat pisses himself on stream
[2:58:46] <%spiritofmojave> Patrick "Ageless Bladder" Boivin
[2:58:47] <%thebetterbard> Piss baby for real
[2:58:50] <+Remery_> His bladder is weak and smol like a Lalfell
[2:58:50] <%kaizerlith> Do levels actually matter so much? I went back to chp.9 at 40 and the fights seem the same. Granted I had purposely shit materia to level all of them.
[2:58:56] <%DappercatEsquire> @de1ete_forever is the a stand yet that makes people piss their pants
[2:58:57] <%Darkfire346> In the OG, Jenova broke out on her own and killed everything, but you never see it happen.
[2:58:59] <%majindusto> As if Hojo could ever stop him...IT'S F-ING SEPHIROTH DUDE!!!!
[2:59:00] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> I dont think he's finishing this today. There's no way.
[2:59:08] <%Meow0369> Turtles you played a different game than me
[2:59:10] <%boogaleeboo> He's done with all the padding
[2:59:13] <%SH1NK1R0> @doctadaking actually that was replaced by cloud passing out in the hallway
[2:59:18] <%boogaleeboo> So it's all story shit
[2:59:19] <%amused_platypus> The bladder gains more power as you grow older
[2:59:19] <%Meow0369> he's like near the end of this chapter and from then on it's pretty smooth sailing
[2:59:34] <%kaizerlith> It's really just a boss rush from here minus one part.
[2:59:36] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> @Meow0369 I never played it, It just seems like theres alot leftt
[2:59:38] <%Dragon_Batman> But Sephiroth is the the one who kills shinra in the og, I think it was suppose to imply that he took her
[2:59:40] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Ahhh okay
[2:59:47] <%spiritofmojave> He can definitely finish today, it sounded like he wanted to go hard in today then break tomorrow sooo
[2:59:49] <%Solid_Stro> @meow0369 Still got two bosses to go before then
[2:59:49] <%Meow0369> Then why would you say that -_-
[2:59:49] <%Wurmspawn> Well story and a handful of bosses.
[2:59:49] <+Remery_> Cloud hasn't had a "Sephiroth Senpai" vision in a while
[2:59:50] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt Wait... What if Sephiroth awakened HOJO to the timeline stuff like Aerith did to Red-13 and Marlene?!!?!?!?!?
[2:59:52] <%DappercatEsquire> an hour or two from shit going off the rails
[3:00:01] <%YakumoYomi> @TurtlesAndTentacles Assuming he doesn't get stuck, he's got around 2.5 hours or so left
[3:00:01] <@SoFarFetched> Pat's definitely gonna try to finish it today if he's gonna take tomorrow of.
[3:00:03] <%boogaleeboo> It'd be a longer than average stream, but not much longer
[3:00:10] <@SoFarFetched> off*
[3:00:12] <%thebetterbard> he has about 4 hours left prob
[3:00:14] <%spiritofmojave> @sofarfetched yeeee exactly
[3:00:15] <+Remery_> Pat is going to finish this or die trying
[3:00:20] <%Darkfire346> Its explained further on that Jenovas parts took on the form of Sephiroth, while the real sephiroth controlled them from the North Crater
[3:00:22] <%ahdurian> did you wash yours hands?
[3:00:25] <%spiritofmojave> nothing at allll!
[3:00:26] <%pipboy344> Did he get to President Shinra’s Office?
[3:00:26] <%Doctadaking> The next boss is my favorite thing in this game.
[3:00:27] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> @YakumoYomi Oh wow. Coolio
[3:00:28] <%tumzfestival> SMOKIN BIG WEEDS
[3:00:29] <%boogaleeboo> not even 4
[3:00:29] <%Dakuu75> enjoying the stream.
[3:00:33] <%WanderTasogare> just discussing your bladder
[3:00:33] <%Ipsenscastle> @TheFabledAble that would be cool but Hojo was surprised by th ghosts earlier
[3:00:34] <%Pyroclase> more likely 3
[3:00:36] <%CelioHogane> 10 MINUTES LEFT
[3:00:36] <%thebetterbard> 3-4
[3:00:36] <%de1ete_forever> it's like that scene where Homer takes wood from the train tracks to build a tree house for bart, that's the derail i want
[3:00:37] <%YakumoYomi> I desire the F E M A L E
[3:00:37] <%weissguard> Enjoyin' the stream.
[3:00:37] <+Remery_> You wish it was 4
[3:00:37] <%kaizerlith> @Dragon_Batman in the original Jenova just wakes up. Maybe from Cloud being there. Until North Crater you never see the real Sephiroth.
[3:00:38] <@JustinianKnight> 3
[3:00:39] <%Hoot_Patoots> naaah more like 2 or so
[3:00:41] <%RyanTheRecluse> its like 2
[3:00:41] <%amused_platypus> did you finish those errands pat
[3:00:41] <+PlagueOfGripes> I'll definitely be unconscious
[3:00:41] <%ringabal> It's smooth sailing now
[3:00:42] <%boogaleeboo> It'd be like a 6 hour stream total
[3:00:43] <%Meow0369> 2-3
[3:00:43] <%DedlokPM> Chapter 17 is L O N G
[3:00:45] <%espanishcanamurciana> Pat how's your prostate?

[5:42:18] <%SaiyanShoto> It’s meteor
[5:42:18] <%Meow0369> Aerith dying HURTS seph because she controls the lifestream
[5:42:19] <SubjectULTIMA> The 7 Seconds is referring to the end of the planet

[5:42:20] <%Daisuke89> @PatStaresAt Seven Seconds is the final moment when you do omnislash. thats my opinion
[5:42:21] <%heartlesshealer> @PlagueOfGripes On my end the stream keeps pausing randomly
[5:42:21] <%RobotPancake> those heralds look like the things from astral chain
[5:42:21] <%baronblank> the game explains the 7 seconds is from the end of the planet from meteor in the chapter 18 description
[5:42:21] <%BubbaRands> love this outro
[5:42:21] <+OnTheDonner> Why would the aspects of Sephiroth's personality be linked to Fate, which Sephiroth is trying to defy?
[5:42:22] <mujahideenfruityrebels> Look, it’s Tomar!
[5:42:24] <cureneckbeard> 7 seconds is how long he can move in the frozen time
[5:42:24] <%Kirby_Sauce> Push tifa in the way of the sword

[5:42:25] <$thesickestzak> WRONG. ITS METEOR
[5:42:25] <+the_scottyssey> I THINK THAT THERE HAVE TO BE TWO SEPHIROTHS
[5:42:25] <%Joestar1890> Sephiroth is still indeed, a dick
[5:42:25] <%evbites> aerith is still gonna die they just removed the ghosts
[5:42:26] <AtomicXIII> 7 seconds before meteor
[5:42:26] <%Masamune195> seven seconds before meteor
[5:42:26] <ECHLORD> Aeriths death literally saves everyone though?

[5:42:29] <BlackermanZX> 7 Seconds before the end of the world
[5:42:29] <%NopeBadguy> METEOR TOOK LIKE SEVEN WEEKS
[5:42:29] <+Sweetmuffin77> In game description tells you it’s the meteor
[5:42:30] <DynemaUmbra> @PatStaresAt in a mission screen, the game literally says that the 7 seconds is referring till the end of the world
[5:42:30] <%213372bu> Meteor is 10 seconds
[5:42:30] <%SH1NK1R0> @patstaresat the seven seconds is referencing the end of the world the chapter description of ch 17 says it
[5:42:31] <%Dragon_Batman> Before it hits
[5:42:31] <dero45> 7sec meteor cast time
[5:42:32] <+abrupt_abe> Someone timed the drop on Youtube, it takes 7 seconds for Seph to drop and kill Aerith
[5:42:32] <nyacoo> Can't wait for Part 2 in 2027
[5:42:33] <+Sticky80sbaby> game is good
[5:42:34] <+freeizone> screencap
[5:42:34] <%DracaenaLeaf> Before it hits

[5:42:36] <%kaizerlith> Just because we don't know for sure and I don't want another Last Jedi where everyone "knew" where it was going. We do not know anything for a fact!!
[5:42:36] <%kewlmyc> 7 seconds to meteor confirmed in the game
[5:42:37] <zamzoph> @PatStaresAt It's some new plot hook
[5:42:37] <%boki_86> Zack is alive but in another timeline the Stamp i another breed
[5:42:37] <%hotcarl6872> Stamp is different in the Zack cutscene
[5:42:37] <%godzookylives> I can't imagine playing this game before the original.
[5:42:38] <+frytheniceguy> alternative timelines
[5:42:38] <%lockhead45> Calling it now game two will be split between the main open FFVII story with cloud and then parts with Zack in universe 2 and in the end of game 3 Cloud and Zack will either join universes and double team Sep or they will both beat him at the same time in their own
[5:42:39] <dmian07> Aerith doesnt know the future, She knows key parts of it
[5:42:39] <%Meow0369> I liked it
[5:42:39] <%Sadira_snack_attack> Its in the game
[5:42:39] <%bread_assassin> Have you been in contact at all about having a one Maximilian Dood on for the FF7 spoilercast?

[5:42:42] <%rezlam> @PatStaresAt 7 seconds related to Aerith death
[5:42:42] <+armor_kuma> The game LITERALLY has a description that says its 7 seconds before meteor
[5:42:42] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> I love this game. SO fuckin good.
[5:42:42] <%Sir_stride> ITS IN THE CHAPTER DESCRIPTION
[5:42:42] <sauce_boss_88> Aerith in Zack's timeline is alive. Cloud's Aerith still dies. When the timelines converge, Zack's Aerith will have to sacrifice herself.
[5:42:43] <%Valdorick> 7 SECONDS TO TAP AREITH ASS
[5:42:43] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> Seven Seconds for Sephiroth to appear and stab Aerith
[5:42:43] <%spiritofmojave> Seven seconds as in each second takes seven years?
[5:42:43] <phatmac16> 7 seconds to mars
[5:42:44] <%XeroSigmaPrime> The chapter select literally says "7 seconds till metoer hits"
[5:42:44] <ThighsSupreme> There is an in game explanation for the 7 seconds
[5:42:44] <%zestyArsenic> 7 Freeza seconds
[5:42:44] <+SaltyGhostRock> 7 Seconds to Mars Kappa

[5:42:49] <%the_vedo_show> atpFeelsBeardMan Clap
[5:42:49] <sosuke5> "7 seconds before the end of the earth" sounds like a quote Woolie would love.
[5:42:50] <+Estuko> 7 seconds, 7 seconds is all the time has to play with you
[5:42:50] <%GohanHitsugaya> So what do you think?
[5:42:52] <+michingmallecho> 7 seconds till meteor kills us...you know when the life stream pushes meteor away...THATS ZACK DYING FOR OUR SINS
[5:42:53] <%Xenokhrist> "Seph shows Cloud a vision of the planet, seven seconds from destruction"
[5:42:55] <+condemned_15> 7 seconds for GLOBAL SATURATION

[5:42:56] <%Kriss1827> Get the dood on the podcast!
[5:42:57] <%Shadowevilkoala> I belive seven seconds is related to aerith's death cutscene which took seven seconds

[5:43:03] <%tearsaurther> zack saved biggs. i know it .
[5:43:03] <lithuenza_azrangr7> Have you seen the chapter 8 church door Zack thing that Woolie mentioned?
[5:43:03] <%Guardiansaiyan> @Kriss1827 hope they do
[5:43:04] <laserbeaming> I thought it was a Doom Clock kind of thing
[5:43:05] <%Dragon_Batman> Watch as you see one or two scenes that you didn't get
[5:43:05] <Moonlight_Grimoire> I took the 7 seconds as 7 seconds to do what he wants to with messing with space-time, hence Cloud decides to save Zack.
[5:43:07] <AutechreTwinAphex> the Aerith death cutscene is exactly 7 seconds long too though - so it could be both
[5:43:07] <zamzoph> 5 minutes until Namek explodes
[5:43:09] <%de1ete_forever> can i hang my plot coat on this hook?
[5:43:09] <%Joestar1890> Game is good, that ending is some weird shit though

[5:43:18] <+Panic_at_the_Discord> Max didn't pick up on anything LUL
[5:43:18] <%goldenchaos96> 7 seconds is the time for aerith being stabbed or Cloud Dropping to fight Sephiroth in the lifestream
[5:43:19] <chaos2frozen> now it would spoil none of us
[5:43:19] <%Eddy21forsaken> get max on podcast
[5:43:20] <%RAAAAAINMAKER> Its not just a theory....
[5:43:20] <+mcjimbo12> Dude, I'm genuinely pretty sure this is the same Aerith as the original game. She's having WAY too much fun with the serious life and death situations.
[5:43:21] <%Aracon_> can't wait for ONLY FF7 CAST NEXT WEEK
[5:43:21] <%rumtumtugnutz> Seriously, though, i think this is going to end overall with it turning out this is a sequel and Aerith is just dicking around in the lifestream, which is why Cloud keeps remembering things from the real FF7\
[5:43:21] <%sshen> I loved kingdom hearts 7
[5:43:22] <+AsinPersuasion> woolie is wrong about the ch 8 church thing its reno there

[5:45:26] <laserbeaming> This sucks for people who didn't play FF7 though
[5:45:26] <+OnTheDonner> You can change stuff without turning it into Kingdom Hearts bullshit
[5:45:26] <%SH1NK1R0> @patstaresat I think part 2 will ultimately determine this games long term perception
[5:45:26] <PinkSocks> F
[5:45:27] <%ThePuddingDead> @PatStaresAt So happy he played it, he's suffering a mild stroke
[5:45:27] <%hotcarl6872> as long as Cloud and Tifa end up together i am good

[5:45:33] <%spiritofmojave> who cares about Roche LUL
[5:45:33] <%cache_22> Where's Wedge?
[5:45:34] <%lord_traxis> Noooo! Why can't I 100% get what I've been experiencing for 23 years?
[5:45:34] <%boki_86> @PatStaresAt you did see that Sephi absorbed the Whispers right
[5:45:35] <%Meow0369> Roche is obviously in clowntown

[5:45:38] <%SaiyanShoto> If people really don’t think we’re going to be going to the same places then they are stupid
[5:45:38] <+mcjimbo12> Roche got scammed, my headcanon is that he is the one who gave Cloud the bike at the end

[5:45:40] <gigamesh00> We must retrieve back the infinity stones !
[5:45:40] <%sirisvirus> Nah roche is going to be team rocket of ff7

[5:45:41] <+Politepies> Destiny Dementors were ehhhhhhh
[5:45:42] <+kreepykulture> it's literally a remake stay mad purists LUL LUL LUL
[5:45:42] <+kekkerscrew> The only problem is that it's a Sequel but they labled it a remake. So people are going to play it and be confused.
[5:45:42] <+armor_kuma> @PatStaresAt The story still fuckin jumps off a cliff in the end though
[5:45:42] <Mr_Strut> I dun geddit

[5:45:51] <%bread_assassin> Now that you beaten it, do you see this as a good entry point to FF7 or is playing the original pretty much mandatory?

[5:45:52] <mackumbopus> Is Wedge still alive?!

[5:46:08] <%Meow0369> @kekkerscrew 100 percent true, the only problem was the marketting IMO.
[5:46:08] <%Alopekis> Ha. Pat agrees with me about the ending. That means I'm right.
[5:46:09] <Ryan1016> Happy birthday to PAT

[5:46:15] <+condemned_15> happ birth
[5:46:16] <%CrypticMochi> No one ever said a remake had to be a 1 for 1
[5:46:16] <%Kiyosuki> I like the idea of Roche coming back as progressively higher ranks in SOLDIER but getting his ass kicked every time regardless while Cloud is just like doodDerp

[5:46:22] <%Doctadaking> I don’t mind a different story, I just think the one we got is fucking stupid.
[5:46:23] <mashiyyat> Happy birthday
[5:46:23] <+kekkerscrew> bread_assassin this isn't an entry point. It would be like playing FF X-2 without playing FFX
[5:46:23] <%Naho_Saenoki> @creamandsugar No, they didn't that was a rumor.
[5:46:25] <%Alopekis> Tifa dies
[5:46:25] <%aBlueWizard> Whispers = fans
[5:46:25] <b_ikki> she totally will
[5:46:25] <%wiley_boi> SING HAPPY BIRTHDAY CHAT

[5:46:27] <%Nupinoop296> i hope not
[5:46:27] <%Darkfire346> Dont they still have to deal with the Reunion bullshit with cloud?
[5:46:27] <+TombstoneTTromboners> Cloud will die
[5:46:27] <%RAAAAAINMAKER> Tifa dies instead
[5:46:28] <Mr_Strut> God I hope she still dies
[5:46:29] <+fortuneshines> Feels like this is like FMA to Brotherhood
[5:46:29] <Picosunloaded> she has to

[5:46:29] <%VashyronM> She totally will
[5:46:29] <gregpivo> Happy birthday Pat
[5:46:30] <+kreepykulture> @charuzu no because everyone still thinks she does
[5:46:30] <+xBolts4Lifex> YES
[5:46:30] <WolfemanMaverik> Doesn't the scale of the ending sap any tension going forward though?
[5:46:30] <%fetrigon> 🎂🎂🎂🎂🎂🎂
[5:46:31] <derap41> So Kingdom Hearts ?
[5:46:32] <AutechreTwinAphex> so sad for the TORtanic guys that a lot of people liked the ending - they're all alone now in their negative circlejerk
[5:46:32] <%BubbaRands> ROCHE DIES INSTEAD LUL
[5:46:33] <%Meow0369> Aerith not dying was a big part of that final part with the flashbacks of her dying when they're beating fate
[5:46:34] <%ringabal> Roche drives the truck that kills Palmer
[5:46:34] <%gespenst25> She's gonna die harder
[5:46:34] <laserbeaming> Reno might not come back
[5:46:34] <%uhdinocat> SO GLAD IT WILL COST $120 TO SEE ALL 0F THIS CRAP
[5:46:34] <BlackermanZX> She will totally die anyways
[5:46:35] <%spiritofmojave> I'm guessing she'll live by now
[5:46:35] <+baseball7000> By the way. Happy birthday, Pat!
[5:46:35] <DaHobo911> LIKE ZACK
[5:46:35] <%LandOfTheWay> Really wish I could play this instead of the original that I never got a chance to. Kinda figured that's what it being a remake meant.
[5:46:36] <%devil_may_cum_> Ending was the worst part but I love this game
[5:46:36] <%evbites> i want roche to come back but get bitch slapped to the dirt
[5:46:36] <%Sadira_snack_attack> She better
[5:46:36] <%DeoxysPrime> This game's ending seems entirely made to justify her living
[5:46:36] <%suikudo> She better fucking not!
[5:46:36] <dmian07> Watch Aerith Resolution!
[5:46:36] <%GohanHitsugaya> Now Tifa will die!
[5:46:36] <DeathByPoke7> Areth will kill zack
[5:46:36] <+OnTheDonner> You can change stuff without turning it into Kingdom Hearts bullshit
[5:46:38] <Onmi_Khaos> Roche is gonna crash the Chocobo Races
[5:46:38] <Crimpson> The fan theory that this remake will make it have an option to save her
[5:46:39] <%shiny_prinny> doesn't she have to die for Holy?
[5:46:39] <TheHardM> Nah, Cloud will die and Barret becomes the main character. Calling it now, timestamp.
[5:46:39] <%TruSanKyuu> What if other party members die
[5:46:39] <%heartlesshealer> The Aerith Lives version was a MOD
[5:46:40] <%hassanico2> If you play as Tifa in the final battle with Japanese voices, Sephy gets really pissy and keeps telling her to go away LUL
[5:46:40] <+Politepies> Kaiden/Ashley but with the waifus
[5:46:41] <%Dragon_Batman> She has to die, the question is will it be the same
[5:46:41] <%ospreyworks> Yeah
[5:46:41] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt Watch Aerith not die and things get absolutely fucking worse as a result
[5:46:43] <+Buzzkill983> Everyone lives!
[5:46:43] <%DXLelouch24> Aerith will die at Northern Crater
[5:46:43] <DratSouma> Yuffie dies
[5:46:43] <%suikudo> Kill Tifa or Yuffie
[5:46:45] <%strugglepunk2> She totally could die still though! THERE'S TENSION NOW!
[5:46:45] <+Mendin> Canon Fate has Aeris Die, but Sephy/Jenova dead and Geostigma cured, so by breaking fate... are we the baddies?
[5:46:45] <%Mr_Pylon> But Seph doesn't give a shit about them
[5:46:46] <%siamzero94> they don't have the balls
[5:46:46] <+michingmallecho> NOJIMA AND TORIYAMA SCENARIO WRITERS. stop bullying Nomura hasWut
[5:46:46] <%ospreyworks> She’s still gonna die
[5:46:46] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> Roche dies to power Holy
[5:46:47] <%starotter70> What if Tifa dies? BibleThump
[5:46:47] <%Meow0369> Worth it
[5:46:48] <+xeros720> wedge dies twice
[5:46:48] <%0dokuro> I hope its multiple paths.
[5:46:48] <%Darkfire346> THEY BETTER NOT KILL FUCKING TITFA
[5:46:49] <CrazyMedicine> I think this will end up with Cloud dying
[5:46:49] <+armor_kuma> TIFA OR AERITH
[5:46:50] <axtonunbound> also happy birthday Pat! April gang!
[5:46:50] <%42nfl19> So "Revive Trinket" was actually THE TRUE ENDING

[5:52:10] <%coreyyotto> Something to consider: The game was marketed as a straight remake, and a lot of people who didn't play the original took that at face value, and that there are multiple plot points that ONLY make sense if you played the original.
[5:52:11] <%Wurmspawn> He's not. I looked it up and talked about it earlier. The voice is very similar I'll admit, but it's not Garrus.

[5:52:18] <%uhdinocat> DIDNT RUIN CHILDHOOD, JUST FALSELY ADVERTISED A GAME WHERE THEY DID WHATEVER THEY WANTED
[5:52:18] <Onmi_Khaos> @PatStaresAt At the edge of creation, in Japanese, when Sephiroth grabs Cloud's hand and talks, he refers to himself as "Ore" where the rest of the game he uses "Watashi". Sephiroth has always used "Ore" to signify pre-Nibelheim Sephiroth and "Watashi" for post-Nibelheim Sephiroth.

[5:52:41] <%Dreadlord134> Cheer1000 I think this is what sephiroth wants cause at the beginning sephiroth tells cloud to run away. Which is what they do, but also isn’t the reason that the original end happens is because aerith dies? If the 7 seconds is Aeriths death scene than he is warning cloud to save her.

[5:54:12] <MsYakumo> @PatStaresAt Fun fact. In one of the old scripts for the OG FF7, Barret was supposed to die to Sephiroth. Barret getting stabbed by him was probably a nod to that.

[5:57:11] <%gespenst25> it's a kissing screen thing
[5:57:11] <NiktenKing> During the final encounter under STORY tab
[5:57:12] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Map screen
[5:57:12] <%spiritofmojave> ONE GUY
[5:57:12] <@JustinianKnight> its a pain to go find
[5:57:12] <%vincerocmm> 1
[5:57:16] <%deviljhojho_> has pat discovered the secret level where he plays as zack and kills kefka?
[5:57:18] <%Doctadaking> Map screen
[5:57:18] <%cache_22> The icons for the chapters show manuscripts and CDs.
[5:57:19] <%godzookylives> psa1guy
[5:57:20] <%Dragon_Batman> oh in 18 before going in
[5:57:20] <Sp3ctre48> That was one guy
[5:57:21] <%Wurmspawn> @AsinPersuasion Not until after y6ou rescue Aerith. Chadley then appears where he wasn't originally and lets you into a simulator you couldn't originally get to.
[5:57:21] <chaos2frozen> Just give him the reddit link
[5:57:21] <%Darkfire346> ONE GUY FUCKING STUPID
[5:57:21] <@JustinianKnight> just look it up
[5:57:23] <%kaizerlith> It's a game over screen I believe.

[5:57:24] <TioXyco> @PatStaresAt enter the chapter, and check the "missions" once in there

[5:57:29] <%dirtyh4rr1> not one guy, it's on cahpter 18
[5:57:29] <%walternatorz> you're dumb.
[5:57:29] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt Chapter 16 is VR, Ch 9 is Colo for Aerith, Ch 14 is Colo for Cloud, Tifa, Barretr
[5:57:29] <%siamzero94> what?
[5:57:29] <%shurtal> it's a loading screen plot dump, like dark souls item descriptions
[5:57:30] <Picosunloaded> damn cant wait for the podcast with max

[5:57:32] <Onmi_Khaos> @Ashecroft That's a bullshit fake, it has already been debunked
[5:57:32] <%snugglepuggs> This was my first Final Fantasy. It motivated me to play OG FFvii
[5:57:33] <dogekingjojo> @Kiyosuki Exactly. People pretend Final Fantasy hasn't had complex big brain plotlines until now. Hell, the shit in Remake is simple by comparison Kappa

[5:57:45] <%Alopekis> Are you going to big us?
[5:57:45] <Crimpson> Wouldn't it be funny if you find out that you never left the VR machine in Shinra at the end of the game and find out that Chadley was just running data on you the whole time?
[5:57:45] <%deviljhojho_> good streamo clap

[5:58:11] <Ashecroft> It has? thats good to hear, havent seen anything debunking it
[5:58:11] <%deviljhojho_> so what do you guys think of the ending?
[5:58:13] <%datmegamandeeeee> DID U SAVE???
[5:58:14] <%Darkfire346> SUCH BULLSHIT
[5:58:15] <%Kirby_Sauce> does pat fuck boot?
[5:58:16] <%SaiyanShoto> @celiohogane I think in the final fantasy 7 one I believe, that’s where Max said he got it from when he showed it
[5:58:17] <%Dragon_Batman> I kinda wanna hear the outlandish ones
[5:58:19] <%boogaleeboo> I will say it again: Sephiroth is a fucking dude in a big black coat that puts his evil into randos in big black cloaks and makes him do his will, and there's like a dozen of them
[5:58:20] <%Dementedpenguin> Post Game Chat is a warzone Kappa
[5:58:20] <mujahideenfruityrebels> It better be in MLA format
[5:58:21] <laserbeaming> but why would she fuck a boot?
[5:58:24] <%ringabal> That settles it, Pat loves the ending. It's all coming together.
[5:58:25] <%boogaleeboo> Kingdom Hearts was always FF7
[5:58:28] <joodatious> that was great, i knew pat would love it
[5:58:34] <dogekingjojo> This is the most final fantasy any final fantasy game has been in a long while. Can't speak for 14 since I fell off after a while though
[5:58:35] <hcsarg86> Will Zack die in place of Aerith?
[5:58:35] <%de1ete_forever> does Pat Boivin is boot fucker?
[5:58:38] <%rumtumtugnutz> Blet
[5:58:41] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> people STILL hatin on Kingdom Hearts.
[5:58:44] <Abd0022> is he on the toilet?
[5:58:48] <+BusterRepukken> One thing is for sure.
[5:58:49] <%b9k9com> The soundtrack for this game is so damn good
[5:58:52] <%deviljhojho_> i dropped out at FF6 so i win either way tomatoCool
[5:58:55] <%Mekhet09> KH is a trashy is this ending was.
[5:59:01] <%godzookylives> I hope we get a sex minigame between Cloud and Tifa under the airship
[5:59:03] <%kaizerlith> @boogaleeboo there are even 12 in the original + Sephi made 13.
[5:59:04] <%boogaleeboo> FF7 was always trashy
[5:59:04] <%Dragon_Batman> most likely a pee
[5:59:05] <%Big_Dream> i liked the game
[5:59:05] <+Remery_> Will Cloud finally go on that date wit Jessie?
[5:59:06] <LorcaNomad> can't believe that people think this ending is bad when kingdom hearts still exists
[5:59:09] <%Big_Dream> it was fun
[5:59:10] <JaerHQ> KH IS TRASH
[5:59:10] <%KawaiiJetty> Fuck the ending but i like the characterization, made me love Barret so hey
[5:59:14] <%Big_Dream> the end
[5:59:15] <%datmegamandeeeee> Roxas is alive now, I can’t believe it
[5:59:18] <%SaiyanShoto> BabyRage BabyRage BabyRage BabyRage PJSalt PJSalt PJSalt
[5:59:20] <%Wurmspawn> But why would you F*** Paige's boots? They ugly!
[5:59:21] <xxshadowxx416> kingdom of heart is great but Disney stuff is bad
[5:59:21] <%boogaleeboo> *Nothing* has changed about the quality or anime insanity
[5:59:22] <%Dio_Goodguy> Bioshock does stupid timeline shit and people say it's bad; FF7 does the same thing and it's a 9/10 videogame LUL
[5:59:24] <dogekingjojo> The ending made the game like 10x better LUL
[5:59:25] <%Doctadaking> I don’t understand how people can shit on KH but be okay with this ending. Or how they can shit on Advent Children but be okay with this ending.
[5:59:27] <%Darkfire346> I predict everyone dies except Cloud and Tifa and they have to repopulate the earth together and Tifa becomes the new source for milk
[5:59:37] <CSeriesJTYPE> where on reddit is this screenshot about 7 seconds
[5:59:37] <%Alopekis> Will we get Goofy in the next FF7R part?
[5:59:45] <%YakumoYomi> Gawrsh
[5:59:49] <joodatious> dio bioshock isnt bad because its time line shit
[5:59:53] <cgame_me811> @lorcanomad Ikr LUL
[5:59:56] <atema128> Complaints about FF7R’s ending just remind me that people are stupid and don’t know enough to recognize good things when they see it.
[5:59:58] <@JustinianKnight> Advent Children's english dub kinda does the characters dirty
[6:00:00] <%deviljhojho_> the flow of time is convoluted in midgar
[6:00:00] <SMuffinMan> HOES MAD
[6:00:04] <+michingmallecho> I remember as a kid playing kingdom hearts 2 and going “who is this tall guy with a wing and why is sorta fighting him”. I still liked kingdom hearts so....you know
[6:00:06] <dogekingjojo> The only people who say timeline shit is stupid are people who prefer constant hand holding in videogames. Put your big boy pants on lads LUL
[6:00:06] <@SoFarFetched> Just let people like or hate the thing.
[6:00:07] <knackirontarkus> Bioshock Infinite is bad because it’s a bad game
[6:00:07] <+jiggy_snipe> you can like things and think they are stupid. I like Chrono Cross, Xenosaga, and KH kinda
[6:00:12] <%Alopekis> HE'S BACK
[6:00:13] <%Doctadaking> I feel like a lot of people are giving this a pass because it’s FF7 where they would otherwise hate it in another franchise
[6:00:13] <%Mekhet09> @Doctadaking I think they're all bad so I'm at least consistant.
[6:00:14] <%de1ete_forever> FeelsBirthdayMan
[6:00:15] <%Dementedpenguin> DansGame
[6:00:16] <bestwaifuritsu> It took Sephiroth exactly 7 seconds to fall and impale Aerith in the Ancient City. Go watch a video and time it.
[6:00:17] <Tha_Mik> I kinda want to watch advent children, should I?
[6:00:19] <+BusterRepukken> most of the people shitting on KH have never touched a KH game, they just parrot what their favorite tuber says
[6:00:20] <%Dementedpenguin> Sure.
[6:00:20] <artoflec> I just feel nothing for this ending, its not exciting for part 2, it was a super hamfisted execution that wasn't even mechanically that fun.
[6:00:20] <%ringabal> Neku comes out of a portal and tells Cloud "Let's mosey."
[6:00:21] <%deviljhojho_> no tomatoSmile

[6:05:40] <+th3madness> Pat just read australian spoilers like everyone else
[6:05:41] <JoviLovesYou> I mean, if you saw that awful fucking trailer...
[6:05:41] <%Keyd00d> He didn't die
[6:05:41] <%Garthunox> pat that was in a trailer

[6:05:44] <%bluefooddye1> Of course the black guy dies
[6:05:45] <kingspaceghost> The Super Pat God Super Pat
[6:05:45] <%Ancopro> well he did but ghosts pushed back

[6:05:48] <%doc_ock_rokc> Because I DON'T BELEVE YOU
[6:05:48] <%Shady_Squid> he got better
[6:05:49] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> Nah, the way that they take Wedge away without even showing a death makes me think they somehow took him OUT of the current timeline. It's too vague otherwise. I think he may somehow enter the Zack is Alive Timeline.

[6:05:56] <LorcaNomad> @PatStaresAt any significant predictions for the next game?
[6:05:56] <Crimpson> They needed Barret alive to keep the timeline
[6:05:56] <%boogaleeboo> She might not have died though

[6:05:59] <+ChuckBartowskiX> she might not be dead
[6:06:00] <akaSiggy> They did super telegraph Barrett's death the whole game
[6:06:00] <+Akizea> she MAY be alive.
[6:06:00] <%skizzuto> too thirsty
[6:06:00] <+younger54> FF7 Remake part 2 is just all of Avalanche getting Final Destination'd
[6:06:00] <xxshadowxx416> she not dead
[6:06:00] <Tha_Mik> Because tifa is best girl
[6:06:01] <@JustinianKnight> to give Barret motivation
[6:06:02] <%RetroCop87> SHE DIED OF THIRST
[6:06:03] <%213372bu> jessie is too op for hotness scale
[6:06:03] <+Arkfyre> Too much thirst
[6:06:05] <%ospreyworks> But now that we’ve seen him brought back, everyone’s gonna think they’ll spare Aerith and WHOOPS we killed the Whispers.
[6:06:05] <%spiritofmojave> she could still be alive if Biggs was
[6:06:05] <%lotharrio> Too thristy.
[6:06:05] <%Dragon_Batman> That is also why the ghosts throw Wedge off a building

[6:06:06] <%de1ete_forever> meh slampig harem

[6:06:09] <%walternatorz> Congratulations!
[6:06:09] <dero45> Brought barret back but killed wedge
[6:06:09] <+jiggy_snipe> it wasnt catacysmic but you get that regardless for guessing Barret
[6:06:10] <%Alopekis> Cloud has to go on a date with Tifa or Aerith but Jessie was in the way.
[6:06:10] <%luftraumm1> she may still be alive tho

[6:06:13] <+AsinPersuasion> MOTOR BALL SAYS OTHER WISE SHITTER
[6:06:14] <%Wurmspawn> @snugglepuggs Jenova can shape shift and ignores the law of physic about mass. Sephiroth appears multiple times throughout the game in impossible ways. Everytime you see him with the exception of where you find him incased in crystal and at the end of the game, you are seeing a piece of Jenova connected to Sephiroth and impersonating him on his behalf.
[6:06:15] <gekizenbu> @Zaphire_Saucypants are we saying wedge is our Marty goingback to the future
[6:06:15] <+DrJamesWoods> That's totally a brownie
[6:06:16] <%Garthunox> THAT LAST ONE DOESNT COUNT COS IT WAS IN A TRAILER
[6:06:17] <%Aracon_> jessie too hot for this gme

[6:10:08] <%boogaleeboo> Who gives a shit what KH is or isn't?
[6:10:08] <zamzoph> @PatStaresAt So.... are you going to finish FF7?
[6:10:09] <%spiritofmojave> this wasn't false advertising it's a REMAKE from the bottom up
[6:10:11] <%aishman> @PatStaresAt Man, can you imagine people jumping into FF7R without ever playing the original?
[6:10:11] <hcsarg86> Why can't people have a nice discussion on Remake with each other without whining like children? Both sides are stupid.
[6:10:11] <%Dragon_Batman> Which is funny cuz like 90 percent is still remade
[6:10:12] <xxshadowxx416> but paige pat is crazy talk

[6:10:17] <T_Sasquatch> SUBVERTED EXPECTATIONS - a shit explanation for a shitty shit
[6:10:18] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @MelancholicMasochist Yeah but people like this game
[6:10:19] <%hzealot> the game was good UNTIL the ending
[6:10:24] <%rytyoung> Was MGS 2 a subversion of expectations? Yes, yes it was.
[6:10:25] <gandhi_the_peacemaker> if they wanted to subvert the story, why didn't they just subvert the story? why bother with time ghosts?
[6:10:25] <DratSouma> FF7 Remade/Remix
[6:10:26] <%marsantas> Paige is a Boivin?
[6:10:28] <alm3na1> Get fucked purists
[6:10:30] <waifoong98> hurdur bad writing gud
[6:10:34] <%rezlam> @MelancholicMasochist Is kingdom hearts a remake? Cause that makes it significantly different.
[6:10:34] <%Aracon_> oh man that would suck
[6:10:36] <%HotBloodedHero> Fuck having to justify shit
[6:10:38] <%ratreborn> KH fans cant accept the two are different, KH3's ending was more dissapointing
[6:10:38] <%baronblank> I think the ending was a little too over the top considering we're only at the end of midgar, but it was still cool and I'm cautiously optimistic for the next game, it'll be interesting regardless
[6:10:39] <Sp3ctre48> HAHA ME
[6:10:39] <+AsinPersuasion> i can't believe people do that
[6:10:39] <%Explodincatz> me
[6:10:40] <@SoFarFetched> Lets calm down chat, a lot of people starting to be angry LUL
[6:10:40] <b_ikki> ah yes
[6:10:40] <+HyperCharge_Sam> The direction it's going is way more interesting than a pure remake, but I have absolutely no faith in Square-Enix to pull it off
[6:10:40] <DeathByPoke7> like me
[6:10:41] <%CaptainInvictus> ok I hopped back in after he presumably finished since I jumped in right as he was encountering the GHOST GESTALT and I see he seems to have enjoyed it
[6:10:41] <tactician0> @Keyd00d yeah and they're WRONG
[6:10:41] <%Xenokhrist> my friend did that and he still loved the game
[6:10:41] <%optimasmaximas> CALL EM OUT
[6:10:41] <%drfaustisdead> That was me.
[6:10:41] <Thalchampz> yeyeyeyeye COOL LIGHTNING
[6:10:42] <%cvp5127> they must be confused
[6:10:44] <chocolate_matter> They literally subvert the ghosts.
[6:10:44] <%Aracon_> they would be SO LOST
[6:10:45] <%Wurmspawn> @snugglepuggs Jenova is a practically a zombie with human intelligence. Sephiroth is trying to use Meteor to destroy the people who took the planet away from the anchients which he sees himself as the true last of. Jenova is essentially the physical embodiment of his will on the planet while he's stuck where he is trying to pull the strings.
[6:10:46] <%Felto3> poeople were actually calling it false advertising when it remakes the whole midgar section as promised
[6:10:46] <%j0ustar> F
[6:10:48] <%boogaleeboo> Because the time ghosts allow the characters to engage with the change
[6:10:49] <%Aydarkzero> i only remember disc 1
[6:10:51] <+Akizea> remake is the PERFECT title for this. this is LEGITIMATELY a remake
[6:10:51] <%snugglepuggs> I DIDNT PLAY THE ORIGINAL BEFORE FFVIIR
[6:10:53] <%ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt Not a Remake, a Reboot, or a Remaster. But FF7: Redacted
[6:10:53] <+b1gboss007> i did and it was ok
[6:10:55] <%arcaderabbit48> @MelancholicMasochist Pat has actually explained this, and his answer is that understanding KH requires playing multiple games across multiple systems, including the GBS and PSP. Whereas this game requires 2 systems and 2 games at most

[6:11:02] <SunsetYellow> calling it false advertising is absolutely MAXIMUM BUTT HURT
[6:11:03] <%TheBenson8r> YUP
[6:11:04] <%jaygee303> That’s me! Still had a blast
[6:11:04] <%Pyroclase> They talked in an interview about how they don't need to explain Sephiroth because "everyone knows who he is"
[6:11:04] <ovan20> @PatStaresAt can you explain to me where does Sephirot come from in this remake? I think i missed a chapter rooDerp
[6:11:05] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Alseid I kinda like it as a sequel thing so I'm not in your camp but I remember that used as a justification for Last Jedi and it pissed me off something fearce
[6:11:05] <%KawaiiJetty> Imagine not playing Crisis Core too
[6:11:05] <%Xenokhrist> SNOWBOARDING
[6:11:06] <%Darkfire346> WORDS
[6:11:08] <+Lunarhawk> I played about 1/4 of FF7 and stopped 10-12 hours in after the boat and its totally fine until you get to chapter 18 and then ti goes into "well fuck i have no context for any of this"
[6:11:08] <%Aracon_> *weird baby noises*

[6:11:13] <%drfaustisdead> I've studied the FF7 extensively however so, no lost here.
[6:11:13] <LonteXV> Can't call it bad writing if they literally planted seeds the whole game LUL
[6:11:14] <%Wurmspawn> Again that's the working theory.
[6:11:14] <%ospreyworks> Odds that they’re totally gonna botch this one harder than the end of game of thrones?
[6:11:14] <%crystalmoonark> I never finished it after you stopped streaming the original ff7 :(
[6:11:14] <+Evil_Emu147> Evil_Emu147 subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[6:11:15] <lithogensnake> But what if the original next parts are bad?
[6:11:16] <%thackattack00> REMAKE DOESNT MEAN THEY CAN CHANGE WHATEVER THEY WANT. NO ONE THOUGHT THATS WHAT REMAKE MEANT BEFORE THIS

[6:11:19] <%CelioHogane> I WANT SEVEN GAMES
[6:11:21] <joodatious> tbh i never played the original and it aint that confusing. probably because the game is so old its easy to know a good bit about the game
[6:11:24] <%Keyd00d> Disc 1 isn't over
[6:11:25] <toomuchsnarfsnarf> YEYEYEYE
[6:11:26] <%Ipsenscastle> The changing things is great because everything after Midgar in the original is a mess. The specific execution of this ending was super 'space flea from nowhere' though.
[6:11:29] <Tha_Mik> PLAY OG FF7 BEFORE THE NEXT ONE COMES OUT
[6:11:34] <+Akizea> @thackattack00 that's your fault.
[6:11:34] <+MelancholicMasochist> Fair enough. They’re both dumb af and I love them.
[6:11:35] <%boogaleeboo> What if they are so good they make the original FF7 look like dogshit?
[6:11:36] <%ospreyworks> Really, the odds of them sticking the landing are SLIM
[6:11:39] <dero45> Disc 2 gonna be crisis remake in disguise
[6:11:40] <+PlagueOfGripes> "Who was the monster cat that didn't like the plate falling?"
[6:11:40] <%Doctadaking> People who never played the original are gonna get to Zack and go “wha”

[6:12:22] <StarlitStunner> Reeve Tuesti is the best
[6:12:24] <%j0ustar> WAT
[6:12:26] <dogekingjojo> They wanted to try and make Reeve look like a cool guy who was trying to stop the plate drop. LUL
[6:12:26] <JanusII> Yeah I'm really curious what people with no context think of Cait Sith showing up in the middle of that super dramatic scene.
[6:12:29] <+forgetme000> whys there a sonic Character in ff7?
[6:12:30] <Sp3ctre48> I havent played OG FF7 but I still knew about Cait Sith LUL
[6:12:31] <%CelioHogane> IF THEY DON'T GIVE ME SEVEN GAMES I WILL RIOT.
[6:12:31] <%startstoprepeat> "who is the black haired cloud, is he evil cloud" is a thing i saw
[6:12:33] <%Ipsenscastle> @doc_ock_rokc yeah I don't particularly object to them, they're no more insane than the WEAPONs
[6:12:33] <%aishman> @PatStaresAt I can only imagine people playing FF7R and going "Who is that cat? Who is that Black-Haired Cloud using the Buster Sword?"
[6:12:35] <%kaizerlith> Yeah Cait Sith was the only part this newbie guy had no clue what it was. He had even guessed Zack was Aerith's first love.

[6:12:41] <%trianglehat> bazurple
[6:12:41] <%snugglepuggs> @wurmspawn so Sephiroth is using Jenova who is using Sephiroth's image while possessing one of the clones during the game and remake or am I wrong? it's confusing lol
[6:12:41] <%CaptainInvictus> @PatStaresAt so if this is FF7:Rebuild, who's Mari
[6:12:42] <%Keyd00d> Me? Gongaga
[6:12:46] <%ImmaCanuck> bOtH sIdEs ArE bAd
[6:12:52] <%spiritofmojave> I wonder if Reeve is still gonna kidnap you know who in a big hero move
[6:12:52] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> @JanusII I thought it was a Palico reference
[6:12:54] <%VritraReiRei> Okay, now the real question is: What will the SEQUEL be called? Final Fantasy VII-2 Remake, VII Remake 2, Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 2?
[6:12:54] <OkoPoko> Gongaga
[6:12:56] <+ghostfaceninja_> ALL YOU NEWBIES NEED TO PLAY THE ORIGINAL, ITS EASY AS FUCK AND THE SAME LENGTH AS THE REMAKE
[6:12:58] <%Darkfire346> PSYCHONAUTS 2 IS ON STEAM

[6:13:02] <%thackattack00> YES IT IS
[6:13:04] <%baronblank> yea, there's definitely stuff in this game that doesn't make any sense to people who didn't play ff7
[6:13:04] <Ryan1016> MALDING
[6:13:06] <BlackermanZX> H O E S M A D
[6:13:09] <%ospreyworks> One of the sequels will be called REUNION

[6:13:16] <%CelioHogane> GOLD SAUCER IS GOING TO BE SO FUCKING BIG
[6:13:17] <%PhantomMiG> @PatStaresAt I think that the return to Midgard toward the end is going to be super different
[6:13:17] <b_ikki> "nonsensical plot and poor pacing" so FF7?
[6:13:17] <%EuropanLamprey> HOW?!
[6:13:17] <SMuffinMan> Yup
[6:13:17] <%arcaderabbit48> Oh totally
[6:13:17] <%boogaleeboo> All the old places are there, they can just go to them
[6:13:18] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Ipsenscastle I thought it was cool way to retred and fill in plotholes
[6:13:21] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Depends on how good they are at writing
[6:13:21] <%thackattack00> YOURE CRAZY IF YOU THINK ANYTHING WILL BE THE SAME THEY CANT WRITE FOR SHIT
[6:13:22] <@JustinianKnight> it can totally still follow the same things
[6:13:23] <turbofolk> IT WILL NOT PAY OFF PAT
[6:13:23] <kentrix11> They already set up Wutai.
[6:13:23] <%kaizerlith> How wouldn't we?! We have to go to Junon to leave the continent.
[6:13:23] <%arcaderabbit48> This game even ends the same way
[6:13:24] <%DetroitSentai> They still need to get sephy, rufus probably wants to get sephy. THE SET UP IS THE SAME
[6:13:26] <%Tenkay> @PatStaresAt Hope they keep Hojo at Costa del Sol in a speedo
[6:13:26] <+jiggy_snipe> its the same world so why couldn't it?
[6:13:26] <%Shwepie> Time Ghosts demand you retread old beats!
[6:13:28] <dero45> What if they combine all the FF7 games into the remake except dirge
[6:13:29] <%tweedler92> HOJO ON THE BEACH WHEN
[6:13:31] <Quinnotetiquan> How in the hell did modern Square pull it off tho?
[6:13:32] <%Eddy21forsaken> no pat they changed everything and nothing will stay the same ironmo1REE ironmo1REE
[6:13:32] <+michingmallecho> Cry more “purists” LuvBlondeL LuvBrownR
[6:13:33] <Sagata_> They absolutely do everything the fucking same
[6:13:33] <%YakumoYomi> Putting Cait Sith for that ONE moment makes no sense, especially to new people
[6:13:35] <joodatious> hErOs oN bOtH SiDEs
[6:13:36] <jopza_10> tbh the ending doesn't change the overall plot of the game. it can, but that doesn't mean it will
[6:13:36] <ovan20> by "accident" Keepo
[6:13:36] <%Valdorick> JESSIE WILL BE AT GOLD SAURCAUR AND ZACK WILL BE AT HIS HOSUE
[6:13:37] <+younger54> They are literally still leaving Midgar looking for Sephiroth
[6:13:37] <%Aracon_> YES

[6:13:58] <%Felto3> tifa already has dolphins
[6:13:58] <%kaizerlith> We would have to hit most of the beats. How else besides Junon would we even leave the continent?
[6:13:59] <cardboardboots> there is no way the dolphin thing is in the game
[6:13:59] <LorcaNomad> oh god i hated the dolphin bit

[6:14:05] <+CelioHogane> @NeonNobleKalzeria JUNON BETTER BE 15 HOURS LONG
[6:14:05] <joodatious> pats big penis is scaring everyone
[6:14:05] <%Aracon_> that's because most of chat has self esteem issues @PatStaresAt
[6:14:05] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> I'm GLAD you're happy.
[6:14:06] <%snugglepuggs> not like a dolphin Pat! WITH a dolphin!
[6:14:06] <%CaptainInvictus> Pat is entirely right and I am super happy with how the remake ended

[6:14:10] <%walternatorz> A confident Pat is a very scary notion
[6:14:10] <hcsarg86> @Dementedpenguin Thank you I look forward to when people can actually have reasonable discussions
[6:14:10] <%Dementedpenguin> I legitimately want FF7R2 to just go batshit crazy. I'd buy that.
[6:14:10] <%Wurmspawn> @snugglepuggs It is confusing. The clones are a part of the original theory except that their moving towards reunion is part of Sephiroth's master plan. Jenova is using Sephiroth's image because Sephiroth is using Jenova.
[6:14:11] <%jaygee303> They’ll be in the same locations and maybe add new ones. It’ll add more not take away

[6:14:37] <%arcaderabbit48> arcaderabbit48 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months, currently on a 12 month streak! The ending doesn't even change that much, we're still off to find Sephy. We didn't even beat him, he leaves after getting what he wanted and giving us a taste of his twunk dick.
[6:14:37] <%Dementedpenguin> @hcsarg86 maybe in a few days. I doubt it's gonna be now
[6:14:38] <%Kaask> its fine to like it, but marketing lied and you can't deny that

[6:14:43] <MsYakumo> Hoes MAD and BALDING!
[6:14:43] <%realm_forge> Stop that
[6:14:44] <mothdude> @snugglepuggs Sephiroth is basically puppeting Jenova's body and acting through it, as well as puppeting the "Sephiroth Clones" who were implanted with Jenova cells. The remake changed it a bit so Sephiroth is only puppeting the Sephiroth Clones instead of Jenova directly.
[6:14:44] <$NocturneNovember> Genesis fans can stay in the dumpsters with the Melee players!

[6:14:49] <%Kriss1827> Hoes were indeed mad
[6:14:49] <PortableBoredom> But it's not the EXACT same game from '97, therefore it's bad! It's not as if I can go back and play the original if I wanted!

[6:15:11] <%YakumoYomi> Are they still going to have those moments in the sequels where Cloud gets mind-controlled by Jenova and tries to kill Aerith? Would that fly in today's world?
[6:15:12] <chocolate_matter> 7.77 you cannot remake
[6:15:13] <%drfaustisdead> It's so fucking brilliant.

[6:15:30] <thatsmycouch> Sephiroth made the purists his bitches LUL
[6:15:30] <%Ipsenscastle> christ
[6:15:30] <%ringabal> Imagine if Cloud prevents Sephiroth from stabbing Aerith only for Gackt to finish the job.
[6:15:31] <+jiggy_snipe> good thing those ghosts saved the party twice at the end Kappa
[6:15:31] <goryloles> @PatStaresAt Do you think that OG FF7 was a premonition and Aeriths face at the end of it represents the begining of Remake?
[6:15:34] <Blackscience91> The "Familiar" Good word
[6:15:34] <joodatious> the meta of the whispers being the purists is hilarious to me
[6:15:34] <Tha_Mik> Thirsty torso

[6:15:40] <%Tenkay> Jessie and Cloud can be in wheelchairs together now
[6:15:41] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> Biggs Alive, Jessie and Wedge not quite determined.
[6:15:42] <%Dragon_Batman> It's funny cuz that was the complaint for Zelda Links Awakening and how it is 1 for 1 remade
[6:15:42] <doggieo> And that torso will deflect Sephiroths blade and save Aeris
[6:15:42] <%luftraumm1> you can fuck the torso hole
[6:15:43] <%lotharrio> Different past now. She never left Golden Saucer?
[6:15:43] <%barkon345> She is going to be alive in the other time line
[6:15:43] <%weissguard> I will lose my mind if Zack is alive and fights Cloud simply for the purpose of sparring.
[6:15:46] <%b9k9com> psaBig

[6:16:17] <jopza_10> KUNSEL IS CANON
[6:16:18] <%aishman> @PatStaresAt I would love to be in the same room as someone who has never played the original and going "Who the fuck is that cat with a crown? Who is that black-haired Cloud with the buster sword and carrying Cloud around?"
[6:16:18] <%Darkfire346> I thought Omega Weapon was cool
[6:16:18] <%cowardman93> deepground still exists
[6:16:18] <%rytyoung> GACKT

[6:16:20] <%Aracon_> dirge is so fucking bad
[6:16:20] <%flamingmonkies2> Zack is such a perfect hero
[6:16:20] <%RubberFistFight> Oh hey
[6:16:21] <%j0ustar> Crisis Core is 90% good
[6:16:21] <%gespenst25> VoteNay
[6:16:22] <%Odyr2001> GACKT IS CANON
[6:16:22] <%thebetterbard> Did they mention Jesse previously working at the Golden Saucer so she could show up or be mentioned in Part 2?
[6:16:22] <%SilverDevilfish> You know Gackt's going to be back
[6:16:22] <TioXyco> @PatStaresAt That the thing. Advent Children is still happening, is still canon. But it happened in other timeline
[6:16:23] <%Dragon_Batman> Alot of the bad is all the genesis and some angeal nonsense
[6:16:23] <%Alopekis> Advent Children is the best
[6:16:23] <+justianxix> ZACK SHOULD STAY DEAD
[6:16:23] <+vampireinarm> elaborate
[6:16:24] <Andrizzleton> It really feels like they wrote themselves out of the burden of creating 1-1 duology/trilogy
[6:16:25] <+Ominnous> but zack dying is part of crisis core
[6:16:25] <%ospreyworks> Angela?
[6:16:26] <dogekingjojo> Dirge of WHO?? Dirge of NON CANON
[6:16:28] <%snugglepuggs> @wurmspawn wait so do they ever clearly explain Reunion in connection with the Sephiroth/Jenova thingie? I'm currently at Rocket Town about to break Meteor and this is my first playthrough after playing Remake lol
[6:16:28] <TheStarvingGood> We'll prb see Jessie at Golden Saucer
[6:16:29] <StarlitStunner> Dirge is great ya orb

[6:16:30] <%Shady_Squid> Poor Clemps
[6:16:31] <%Ipsenscastle> YOU SEE THE DEEPGROUND LAB THOUGH
[6:16:31] <%Dementedpenguin> o_O
[6:16:32] <$KnivesEve> GACKT IN PART2
[6:16:34] <%YakumoYomi> Advent Children was good for the fights, and we can just get those in the modern games.
[6:16:35] <+peaceful80085> Remember - Ff13 and 3rd birthday played with this time/destiny shit!
[6:16:35] <NiktenKing> They can't because Genesis gets picked up by Weiss and Nero in CRISIS CORE if they are still making G SOLDIERS
[6:16:35] <%spiritofmojave> DIRGE OF WHAT?
[6:16:35] <%kaizerlith> Hahahahaha!!!

[6:16:56] <%UvBenServed> And then Wedge and Roche join the party
[6:16:57] <gandhi_the_peacemaker> pat's memory of og ffvii and compilation is not nearly as good as his confidence would suggest
[6:16:57] <%weissguard> Twin OMNISLASH with Zack and Cloud.
[6:16:57] <Picosunloaded> different timeline pat look at the mascot
[6:16:58] <%kaizerlith> Pat what if Vincent plays like he does in Dirge? That would honestly be horrible.
[6:16:58] <+Voidknight13> pat they mention loveless has a new ending
[6:16:59] <%ospreyworks> Angeal? Genesis? That other professor? LOVELESS?
[6:17:01] <%Xenokhrist> no Gackt has to protect the planet tho
[6:17:01] <Skatedeandre> Zack May have not died but 99.9% of crisis core still happened
[6:17:02] <%Dragon_Batman> I don't think they can say his name legally
[6:17:03] <Ryan1016> EW FF8
[6:17:04] <%arcaderabbit48> Joking aside, new party members??
[6:17:04] <Kingdomkey202> I'm interested in what they'll do with the story, beyond with Aerith, I'm curious about what they might do with Red's dad Seto and Dyne
[6:17:05] <Incognitohat> pat, hojo mentions G types in the board meeting, nothing is off the table
[6:17:05] <+ghostfaceninja_> EWWW NO

[6:17:10] <CSeriesJTYPE> okay what am I supposed to be looking for in the mission details thats supposed to be about the 7 seconds thing
[6:17:10] <%ape_hawk> like, worse than ff13
[6:17:11] <%Keyd00d> If we can successfully negate the Compilation then this is a 10 on 10
[6:17:12] <+younger54> It would be FF10 if anything
[6:17:12] <%optimasmaximas> FF8 FANS doodBarf
[6:17:12] <%luftraumm1> that would be great
[6:17:12] <dero45> If the ghost take memory’s zack might not know what’s what
[6:17:12] <%spiritofmojave> Yes
[6:17:13] <Andrizzleton> As an 8 fan I would HATE that
[6:17:13] <%ape_hawk> yeah, i said it
[6:17:14] <%aeonicvector> FF8 REALLY needs the remake more then 7, so plz squenix
[6:17:15] <%IntrepidEye> Zack is 100% going to be a guest party member at some point in remake 2
[6:17:15] <Shardlab> Yeah mothanksbye
[6:17:15] <$NocturneNovember> @PatStaresAt Just remember that they threw Genesis in the Nibelheim scene to tell Sephiroth "Hey buddy, that door's got your mom's name on it, funny huh?"
[6:17:16] <%Xenokhrist> he SAYS AC lines
[6:17:16] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> YO what if Roche joins the party later after leaving Midgar when he learns Cloud is gone
[6:17:16] <%Kiyosuki> No Genesis doesnt have to protect anything really
[6:17:17] <%richmon_> not in a million years

[6:17:55] <%MattzosoSA> Was busy doing report for university. Did Pat get big mad?
[6:17:56] <+ZipperHands> @PatStaresAt Do you think FF7R Part 2 we'll be getting a dual campaign of Cloud and crew and alt timeline Zack
[6:17:57] <CSeriesJTYPE> except the sephiroth you see at every point in the remake is jenova
[6:17:58] <%ringabal> Sephiroth: The Ultimate Pear
[6:18:02] <linxonia> is advent children bad?
[6:18:02] <Personified134> is it over?
[6:18:02] <%Dakuu75> amazing
[6:18:02] <%BonewheelVanguard> @PatStaresAt Or we'll get a ff7 that is Zack based rather than cloud based
[6:18:02] <%CaptainInvictus> ILLUMINATED PAT
[6:18:04] <%CelioHogane> @Dementedpenguin DUDE WHAT IF YOU START THE GAME PLAYING AS BIGGS!?
[6:18:04] <%therealgirthman> INCOMING PEAR
[6:18:04] <%Kiyosuki> Sephiroth often appears with a music cue that comes straight from Advent Children, or at least the "future" Sephiroth
[6:18:05] <$thesickestzak> THIS PEAR
[6:18:06] <%walternatorz> sephiroth tried to give cloud a pear??
[6:18:06] <ralphfromdk> b1gboss007 Well that's not as fun :l
[6:18:07] <+paladinstarbuster> I EAT PEARS AN SHIT LIKE THAT
[6:18:07] <brothernerofgc> i just came in and you alraedy screaming
[6:18:08] <%Emperor_Machinus> and holding a pear
[6:18:09] <joodatious> pat likes advent children its stupid
[6:18:10] <%kaizerlith> Don't know.
[6:18:10] <%KawaiiJetty> Cid with banana is cooler
[6:18:10] <%Odyr2001> YES SHOW US
[6:18:10] <%CrazyRainbows> Multiverse shit is the goddamn best fuck
[6:18:11] <%Arxel1> @MattzosoSA Total opposite, he loved it
[6:18:11] <%YakumoYomi> I clapped when he said the thing.
[6:18:11] <%weissguard> Shall I give you DIS PEAR? Cloud: I'm allergic.
[6:18:11] <mothdude> The One Black Wing was never in the OG FF7.
[6:18:12] <+peaceful80085> Advent children Sephiroth is the worst sephiroth
[6:18:12] <hcsarg86> Is Angeal still dead?
[6:18:12] <+BusterRepukken> @MattzosoSA no he loves the ending
[6:18:12] <Andrizzleton> what's the gay doritos one?
[6:18:14] <%ospreyworks> Pears suck
[6:18:14] <%Ancopro> the very first key art for remake
[6:18:14] <%DracaenaLeaf> I like when Cid says Banana
[6:18:14] <Shardlab> I love how Aerith is so unimpressed with him
[6:18:16] <%snugglepuggs> @mothdude is it later after all the huge materia?
[6:18:16] <%arcaderabbit48> @CSeriesJTYPE Those are basically the same thing at this point
[6:18:18] <@JustinianKnight> alot of that fight is shot for shot outta AC
[6:18:18] <%Valdorick> I can't wait to find out that what Cloud really changed was that he killed Sin and saved Spira, so Tidus never faded. psaSmug
[6:18:18] <$Partyman345> Cheer500 This is first time cheering, anyway here my prediction what if Biggs is terribly wounded and can’t fight back and Jessie doesn’t remember how in Midgar and doing theatre in the Gold Saucer? Also Happy Birthday
[6:18:19] <%luketrapwalker> DON'T EAT YOUR BEARD PAT
[6:18:20] <%Dementedpenguin> @CelioHogane PogChamp
[6:18:20] <dero45> Yeah that’s endgame Sephiroth doodNuts
[6:18:20] <%ratreborn> i miss Angeal
[6:18:20] <%MattzosoSA> Rad
[6:18:20] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> Best soundtrack thing for me, was when you wait and wait and wait for J-E-N-O-V-A to kick in the soundtrack, and then the end of that fight blasts the more or less original soundtrack soooo goood I love it!
[6:18:21] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> I think that's why President Shinra got thrown the window. Advent!Sephiroth tried to save him but Original!Sephiroth stabbed him
[6:18:21] <%Futurecity10> Isnt this sepiroth clone 0
[6:18:24] <b_ikki> nailing it
[6:18:25] <%RetroCop87> @PatStaresAt man, what if they go harder into the FFx connection?
[6:18:25] <Sartastic> beard chewer
[6:18:26] <%Odyr2001> No the first key art for remake
[6:18:27] <+Jake_Protagonist> It’s in Kingdom Hearts too
[6:18:28] <%213372bu> Advent Children is like watching an AMV on mute ehilr a TED Talk plays
[6:18:28] <+Marsidicus> When they went to a conference and only showed one picture as their update instead of gameplay.
[6:18:35] <NiktenKing> @PatStaresAt Weiss and Nero pick up Genesis in Crisis Core, to which they are still using his G cells to make SOLDIER Gs So no, Dirge Could still be in canon so long as Hojo still lives
[6:18:36] <%SH1NK1R0> @patstaresat it’s the deluxe edition wallpaper. It shows ac sephiroth in the background and no one noticed
[6:18:36] <%tearsaurther> zack saved biggs and jessie, totally saved wedge from falling at the shinra building
[6:18:39] <dogekingjojo> FF7R is now the best FF7 game Kappa
[6:18:39] <$thesickestzak> I laughed so hard when Cloud said bitch
[6:18:42] <%Pyroclase> Apparently in the Japenese version, Sephiroth switches pronounds during the final fight in Remake
[6:18:45] <%DakotaMacDoodle> would there be two of him now
[6:18:51] <%Alopekis> Isn't the Sephiroth in AC technically a clone?
[6:18:55] <%NitronStreams> BIG KH ENERGY
[6:18:56] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> I like that final boss area
[6:18:58] <%Nupinoop296> it was cool
[6:18:58] <%rytyoung> oooooh yeah that's cool
[6:18:59] <+Lunarhawk> No pat theyre talking about Demon Tide in KH3
[6:19:00] <%spiritofmojave> It basically was KH2
[6:19:00] <%Kaask> the kingdom hearts bullshit is the ghosts
[6:19:00] <%ape_hawk> nomura hates buildings, man
[6:19:01] <%Daniel_Is_I> THE PENULTIMATE BOSS IS LITERALLY A KH TUTORIAL BOSS
[6:19:01] <%j0ustar> you mean the BEST PART?
[6:19:01] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> in KH2
[6:19:02] <%Dragon_Batman> Interesting thought, it was kool
[6:19:02] <linxonia> LUL
[6:19:04] <%Kaask> literally a giant heartless
[6:19:05] <%CanadianAnimatorGuy> You mean the best parts of Kingdom Hearts???
[6:19:05] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> Yeah LUL
[6:19:06] <%maximemeretrax> Best final boss sequence OAT
[6:19:08] <Croetec> liking KH2
[6:19:08] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> that shit was great
[6:19:08] <%BisoromiBear> "cool"
[6:19:08] <%ringabal> IT'S PERFECT
[6:19:09] <%Robot_Nixon_> I was more reminded of advent children
[6:19:10] <%j0ustar> in kh2 I mean
[6:19:11] <joodatious> what if this is actually just funny valentine with what seph is trying to do
[6:19:11] <Tha_Mik> Darkness though
[6:19:12] <%luftraumm1> best part of kh
[6:19:12] <%Daniel_Is_I> "Cool"
[6:19:12] <%kaizerlith> When Sora anime cuts down multiple buildings in one move.
[6:19:13] <%hatesdps> KH2 is actually just a great game
[6:19:14] <%NopeBadguy> PEOPLE SAY "KINGDOM HEARTS" AS A BUZZWORD WITHOUT REALIZING WHAT IT MEANS BECAUSE THEY NEVER PLAYED IT
[6:19:14] <%Wurmspawn> @snugglepuggs No. lol. That's why I've been adding, "working theory" It probably was getting lost in chat cause I didn't ping you with it. The back-layer story isn't fully explained ever. I think Reunion is partly Sephiroth using clones connected to Jenova the same way he's using Jenova because the clones have Jenova cells, and also it may simply have to do to Hojo's experiments and Sephiroth just using it to his favor.
[6:19:15] <NeetKiller> The World that Never was is KINO
[6:19:15] <chocolate_matter> It is cool.
[6:19:16] <%shiny_prinny> the organization ghosts
[6:19:16] <Personified134> but advent children is terrible
[6:19:16] <%whiskey_wolfe_> The Whispers are the Heartless though.
[6:19:17] <%ospreyworks> HEARTLESS
[6:19:18] <BlackermanZX> The good part of AC
[6:19:19] <%Ancopro> but kingdom hearts means BAd right?
[6:19:19] <%GohanHitsugaya> Yeah, that shit was awesome.
[6:19:20] <APsaull> The best part of kh2
[6:19:20] <%weissguard> Maaaaan, the track that plays during that part is sick. A Fight To The Death is great.
[6:19:21] <%Aracon_> it is beat for beat AC
[6:19:21] <%startstoprepeat> nobody mentioned the power of friendship or whatever so it's fine
[6:19:21] <%cvp5127> kh has time travel
[6:19:22] <%maximemeretrax> SAME YEAR
[6:19:22] <%BoomerUnchained> It is dumb KH writing
[6:19:22] <$thesickestzak> THE BEST PART
[6:19:23] <Reilata> It was pretty sick.
[6:19:23] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> people just wanna be mad.
[6:19:24] <%Doctadaking> Ending of KH2 is amazing
[6:19:24] <glass_marcus> the cool stuff is the dumb stuff
[6:19:24] <%Masamune195> Sora fucking time travels in 3
[6:19:25] <%Aydarkzero> Sora cut buildings first Kappa
[6:19:25] <dero45> And fighting giant darkness dude
[6:19:25] <%hzealot> I'm fine with them changing things they have changed things in RE2 remake, R3make, etc, but the ghosts is such a dumbass concept, the sucking of sephiroths dick is so annoying with how little he is in the first part of FF VII and just cuz hes popular have to shove him down our throat @PatStaresAt
[6:19:26] <%skizzuto> I think people were comparing the giant whisper to a boss in KH
[6:19:26] <ToastedAeolo> When people say KH stuff, they probably meant the timeline stuff haha
[6:19:28] <%DetroitSentai> PEOPLE DONT KNOW WHAT KINGDOM HEARTS IS PAT
[6:19:29] <%cache_22> When's the KH series playthrough, Pat?
[6:19:29] <%Nupinoop296> @NopeBadguy honestly!!! it's so annoying
[6:19:29] <SunsetYellow> people who played 2 hours of the original FF7 bitching about "kingdom hearts shit"
[6:19:30] <%rytyoung> HUH
[6:19:30] <%GohanHitsugaya> Damn
[6:19:30] <%Alopekis> The awesome fight scene
[6:19:31] <%valriot> LUL LUL PURISTS MALDING
[6:19:32] <%optimasmaximas> LUL
[6:19:33] <Warbot40> It was the time travel multiuniverse stuff.
[6:19:33] <%RetroCop87> the final boss of FF7R is essentially a Darkseid Heartless
[6:19:34] <%aeonicvector> YUP
[6:19:34] <b_ikki> the people who say that dont really know kingdom hearts
[6:19:34] <%spiritofmojave> LUL
[6:19:35] <%Robot_Nixon_> They copied each other

[6:19:41] <%Shwepie> It's Nomura shit.
[6:19:42] <Tha_Mik> Or is it?
[6:19:43] <%DestroyerDJ8> kingdom hearts is just final fantasy with disney characters anyways, its all final fantasy shit
[6:19:43] <%boogaleeboo> Like here's the problem with KH3: The actual important part is heavily backloaded and they keep fucking throwing at you and throwing it at you
[6:19:43] <toomuchsnarfsnarf> LUL
[6:19:43] <+stoutfish> @PatStaresAt So when the cloud loses his super powers in the next game are they going to pretend he never had them?
[6:19:44] <+Freelance7> Final Fantasy has always been crazy
[6:19:45] <%AnIcedCoffee> @PatStaresAt Kingdom Hearts has ridiculous timeline shit now too (that's done way worse than it is in this) which is why a lot of people were saying that too
[6:19:45] <jbrachob> its advent children shit
[6:19:45] <%courtoffamine> the running on buildings is the WORST part
[6:19:45] <%luketrapwalker> LAWYERED
[6:19:48] <%Daniel_Is_I> Nomura shit is Nomura shit
[6:19:49] <alm3na1> Purists Reaching hard
[6:19:49] <+BusterRepukken> People just parrot what they hear about KH, theyve never even touched the series
[6:19:49] <%YakumoYomi> Didn't KH2 come out the year before AC in Japan?
[6:19:50] <Sp3ctre48> Pat's never been more right that he has been today
[6:19:50] <%Felto3> KH2 has AC advertising in it
[6:19:50] <%b1gboss007> psaBig psaDab psaDab psaDab
[6:19:51] <%Doctadaking> People say KH shit because of the time travel
[6:19:51] <Shardlab> Oh yeah, they were marketing that Advent Children hard in KH2
[6:19:52] <%CanadianAnimatorGuy> "KH writing" simps should be ignored
[6:19:52] <%kenstank> Yeah Sephie uses "ore" instead of "watashi" which is what he used before he went nuts in that last cutscene
[6:19:53] <%CelioHogane> IMAGINE IF KH CLOUD APPEARS IN FF7-2!
[6:19:53] <%shiny_prinny> defeated with facts and logic
[6:19:54] <@JustinianKnight> It's almost like KH is half FF
[6:19:55] <+ghostfaceninja_> ITS ALMOST AS IF THE TWO WERE MADE BY THE SAME PEOPLE...... HMMMM Kappa
[6:19:55] <Skatedeandre> Oh I didn’t know that
[6:19:57] <%ape_hawk> time travel bullshit was in the very first final fantasy
[6:20:02] <+justianxix> The magic portal to Final Boss was totally KH Shit
[6:20:03] <%Ipsenscastle> Why was Cloud suddenly so super skilled and invincible at the end? That kind of took a lot of the charm away for me
[6:20:03] <%Zombrocom> Man, the Spite is giving Pat so much power and glee
[6:20:03] <%b9k9com> psaWink
[6:20:04] <%Typhaeon> I think the character writing gets a bit thin toward the end but I don't understand most of the vitriol
[6:20:05] <+michingmallecho> NOJIMA WROTE ADVENT CHILDREN SCENARIO
[6:20:06] <gandhi_the_peacemaker> but the advent children shit is just as dumb, so...
[6:20:06] <turbofolk> Bring plague to the podcast
[6:20:07] <%Valdorick> You're Gonna Blow Woolie?
[6:20:07] <+Luigicow92k> @PatStaresAt Fighting the physical embodiment of fate and the big bad knowing all the secrets and manipulating the party is literally some dumb KH shit
[6:20:07] <%Kaask> The Kingdom Hearts shit specifically refers to the time travel shenanigans and the giant heartless boss.
[6:20:07] <Sokumotanaka> Btw pat's super right about Aerith's face being the last thing you see of ff7, I looked it up cause my memory served
[6:20:12] <+paladinstarbuster> MY MANGO

[6:20:14] <%ringabal> @PatStaresAt CSB: Chadley is Gackt's Heartless
[6:20:16] <dero45> Harbinger was the KH shit he was basically the darkness guy u fight in KB1
[6:20:18] <%Alopekis> You guys are just jealous that Nomura is handsome.
[6:20:18] <b_ikki> YES AND HIS INTRO IS THE ENDING OF FF7
[6:20:20] <RadShiro> @PatStaresAt the time ghosts are basically whiny purists trying to keep the game as original
[6:20:20] <%RubberFistFight> Wait what's Pat yelling at today, I wasn't here for most of it.
[6:20:25] <joodatious> alot of fake fans who think they know what FF was
[6:20:25] <%Solid_Stro> Number 2?
[6:20:25] <%Sir_stride> hmmmmm
[6:20:26] <dogekingjojo> Sephiroth ABSORBED the ghosts.
[6:20:27] <%Valdorick> ... But Sephie does hear the ghosts?
[6:20:27] <+regularjimmy88> Have Woolie call Paige on the podcast
[6:20:29] <Picosunloaded> did you notice the different dog logos on the chips pat? @PatStaresAt
[6:20:30] <%Solid_Stro> Clone 2?
[6:20:31] <%Dragon_Batman> He only is seen controlling them after the gang defeat the ghosts
[6:20:31] <tusk102> @PatStaresAt ADVENT CHILDREN EVEN CAME OUT IN AUGUST OF THAT YEAR. KH2 WAS DECEMBER SO FF7 WAS FIRST
[6:20:32] <%ratreborn> gottem
[6:20:35] <thatsmycouch> Sephiroth is literally controlling the ghosts now
[6:20:36] <%Valdorick> He KEEPS ATTACKING THEM
[6:20:41] <Megamanxdood> paige is now a dismbodied voice that spurns pat on
[6:20:43] <%ospreyworks> Really, though, how is the Midgar Zolom supposed to be threatening after that?
[6:20:43] <%drfaustisdead> @dogekingjojo My thoughts exactly.
[6:20:46] <%baronblank> my only worry now is that reigning it back in for the next game is gonna be kinda difficult, yuffie stealing materia only goes so far
[6:20:46] <Skatedeandre> No paige don’t it’ll be way funnier
[6:20:47] <%Dementedpenguin> @RubberFistFight just having a post-ff7r discussion
[6:20:47] <TheyCallMeVawn> Hes still super dead
[6:20:47] <%Valdorick> They stop fate, AND HE'S TRYING TO FUCK FATE
[6:20:48] <+ghostfaceninja_> AND SEPH IS CLEARLY USING THE GHOSTS IN THE LAST FIGHT
[6:20:48] <Sp3ctre48> He absorbed them ghosts, them beating him essentially killed them off
[6:20:50] <+paladinstarbuster> LUL

[6:21:07] <inkflow1993> multiverse
[6:21:07] <%the38bandit> alternate timeline
[6:21:07] <%rumtumtugnutz> maybe he's the Angel of the Slums
[6:21:08] <tusk102> @PatStaresAt going after sephy?
[6:21:08] <%ape_hawk> alternate timeline
[6:21:08] <%spiritofmojave> Think that's supposed to be another future?
[6:21:09] <%DetroitSentai> Different dog on the chips pat, different timeline
[6:21:09] <xxshadowxx416> he do so thing
[6:21:10] <xxmagonx> Alt timline
[6:21:10] <%drfaustisdead> New timeline.
[6:21:10] <%DracaenaLeaf> Did you notice how stamp looked?
[6:21:10] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> I legit think that was just a flash back. Zack is probably big dead
[6:21:11] <%Guardiansaiyan> ALTERNAT TIMELINE
[6:21:11] <linxonia> Just please dont have an evil cloud
[6:21:11] <%weissguard> Gongaga? @PatStaresAt
[6:21:11] <+Aheg0d> Banging HOES
[6:21:12] <%aeonicvector> @PatStaresAt Second party, Vincent Zach and Yuffie
[6:21:12] <dogekingjojo> The whole point is that Sephiroth manipulated Cloud and Co. into beating the plot ghosts so he can CONTROL the plot ghosts. Sephirioth is in DIRECT CONTROL OF THE NARRATIVE.
[6:21:12] <Sokumotanaka> Probably in hiding
[6:21:12] <%Robot_Nixon_> he went out for smokes and didnt come back
[6:21:13] <%optimasmaximas> killing soldier g @PatStaresAt
[6:21:14] <toomuchsnarfsnarf> different timeline ?
[6:21:14] <%NitronStreams> Why does Cloud have sword?
[6:21:14] <%213372bu> Alternate timeline different stamp on Chip bag
[6:21:14] <%Dragon_Batman> It could be a different timeline or he just dies in 2 seconds
[6:21:15] <%drfaustisdead> We'll find out.
[6:21:15] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> Maybe Hojo has him again
[6:21:15] <syahmir33> maybe aerith cab see alt timeline zac
[6:21:15] <krow021> Just curious. Would you be this psyched if at the end of RE2 remake you found out that Birkin was a time traveling plagas zombie looking for a round 2 against Leon just so they could make an all new re4 later
[6:21:15] <SMuffinMan> Alt timeline
[6:21:16] <SunsetYellow> he probably died right after that scene we saw
[6:21:16] <NiktenKing> Yes
[6:21:16] <tactician0> @PatStaresAt Think woolie will love the Rufus fight?
[6:21:17] <%ThePuddingDead> @PatStaresAt I think we're looking at two separate timeline events about to connect later
[6:21:18] <+GalaxyHAMMER56> alt timeline
[6:21:18] <%RubberFistFight> @Dementedpenguin I've never played any FF so I legit have no idea or context lol.
[6:21:18] <%Solid_Stro> The Stamp dog is a different breed
[6:21:18] <%Ipsenscastle> Zack is in his moon prison
[6:21:18] <%skizzuto> that scene isn't in the same timeline as Cloud, the package has a different Stamp the dog
[6:21:19] <%ahdurian> YES
[6:21:19] <GenericSoda> I hope so
[6:21:19] <%therealgirthman> WAIT YEAH 2 TIMELINES THAT WAY JESSIE WAIFU CAN BE ALIVE IN THE OTHER ONE
[6:21:19] <%Aracon_> vineMAYbe
[6:21:19] <%Xenokhrist> HELL YEAH BITCHES
[6:21:19] <%QuadraticGravity> I hope so
[6:21:20] <%AnIcedCoffee> YES
[6:21:20] <%spiritofmojave> MAYBE
[6:21:20] <%Legato_Ambrose> OF COURSE
[6:21:20] <%Darkfire346> zack and cloud going to have a contest on who can dick their girlfriends better
[6:21:21] <%ringabal> OH BOY
[6:21:21] <Sp3ctre48> YES
[6:21:21] <%GanksGoneWrong> stuck at the DMV
[6:21:22] <MattoBii> the stamp bag shows it's an alternate timeline
[6:21:22] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> Different Stamp
[6:21:22] <%Sir_stride> YES
[6:21:22] <%shiny_prinny> haven't we already?
[6:21:22] <%Guardiansaiyan> @PatStaresAt STAMP is different
[6:21:23] <%genowyn> Maybe Gongaga isn't exploded in this timeline
[6:21:24] <@JustinianKnight> sure
[6:21:24] <+ghostfaceninja_> REFER PAT TO THE CHIP BAG @PatStaresAt
[6:21:24] <+paladinstarbuster> DIFFERENT STAMP
[6:21:24] <%Pyroclase> There's absolutely at least two different timeliens involved
[6:21:24] <%arcaderabbit48> @ospreyworks Just make the Midgarzormr a massive monster. Its fairly obvious Sephy let the group win cause they did what he wanted them to do. Not sure why people keep bringing this up
[6:21:24] <%j0ustar> Looks like
[6:21:25] <%cache_22> Alt timeline (alt stamp)
[6:21:25] <%gespenst25> He wasn't alive again until you killed the ghosts??? maybe?????
[6:21:25] <Megamanxdood> you ever watch LOST?
[6:21:25] <%JonathLP> Zach survived in an alternate timeline. Stamps is different on the bag in the cinematic.
[6:21:25] <%Kriss1827> YES
[6:21:25] <creep_in_your_house> He is hanging with Runsel
[6:21:26] <%Daniel_Is_I> Doesn't Chrono Cross suck?
[6:21:26] <%Solid_Stro> STAMP
[6:21:27] <Warbot40> MAYBE?
[6:21:27] <lemon_lore> lizards ppl?
[6:21:27] <+ChuckBartowskiX> he's still dead as far as clouds concerned
[6:21:27] <%Verd_254> FF7: Chrono Trigger boys
[6:21:27] <%luftraumm1> wheel chair portal
[6:21:28] <%kaizerlith> @Dragon_Batman yeah I took that as he has whatever is left after the big conglomeration died. They seemed to try to stop his meteor still but than they look like they get absorbed into him.
[6:21:28] <BlackermanZX> STAMP is different
[6:21:28] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> How Sephiroth refers to himself in the Japanese version might actually be implying that you are seeing two versions, pre, and post Shinra Mansion incident.
[6:21:29] <%NopeBadguy> PEOPLE KEEP THROWING AROUND ALTERNATE TIMELINE WITHOUT PLAYING THE ORIGINAL TO KNOW WHAT'S THE SAME OR DIFFERENT
[6:21:29] <+azure22900> Stamper was different in Zacks timeline
[6:21:29] <%CanadianAnimatorGuy> Stamp Dog is a Beagle now in Zach's timeline
[6:21:30] <+justianxix> You love Chrono cross don't you
[6:21:30] <dero45> Zack memory’s are messed up too
[6:21:30] <%Odyr2001> alternate timeline because there was a different dog for stamp
[6:21:30] <%Alopekis> We're going to have to fight Cloud from the alternate timeline.
[6:21:31] <+SladeClegane> Different Stamp, different timeline.
[6:21:32] <%RubberFistFight> @hcsarg86 would us viewers like him if he didn't do that shit though? LUL
[6:21:32] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> Maybe?
[6:21:32] <%Legato_Ambrose> DIFFERENT STAMP MEANS DIFFERENT WORLDS
[6:21:34] <%boogaleeboo> Zach is 100% alive....wherever he is
[6:21:34] <Shardlab> Second timeline affected by Zack's choices
[6:21:34] <%Valdorick> Its also an OLDER Stamp
[6:21:35] <%The_Butterfly_Man> maybe
[6:21:35] <%Nephitamine> FF7: Chrono Break
[6:21:35] <%spiritofmojave> Plague did note different Stamp
[6:21:36] <$NocturneNovember> I forgot that Pat LOVES Chrono Cross LUL
[6:21:37] <%Ipsenscastle> Zack squatted too hard and his bowels exploded
[6:21:39] <%NeonNobleKalzeria> Different Stamp
[6:21:40] <+michingmallecho> We’re going to play the reactor bombing but with ZACKU IN PART 2
[6:21:41] <TheyCallMeVawn> But its also a few years before all this
[6:21:42] <+earthboundvictor> chrono cross is godlike
[6:21:43] <%ringabal> I can't believe Stamp was a plot device the whole time
[6:21:43] <%RetroCop87> Mickey has different designs
[6:21:43] <%Keyd00d> yeah chrono cross is... great
[6:21:44] <ZE_Count> CHRONO CROSS/KINGDOM HEARTS
[6:21:44] <%aeonicvector> No, chronocross is about twin matched timelines that have to co-exist, not seperated eternally
[6:21:44] <%ape_hawk> stamp is a different dog, dude
[6:21:46] <%Valdorick> LOGOS CHANGE YOU MARKS
[6:21:47] <%rytyoung> He a Border Terrier in Zacks wurldo
[6:21:47] <%Axellogic> The ended is surprisingly subdued for all the shit happeneing
[6:21:49] <%DXLelouch24> They zoomed on the bag too
[6:21:49] <Sokumotanaka> @PatStaresAt Probably with his parents or cissinei
[6:21:50] <+jiggy_snipe> @Daniel_Is_I Pat hates it but I like it. The story is really really dumb
[6:21:51] <%walternatorz> terrier stamp is proof of alternate timeline
[6:21:51] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> They take a very big second to FOCUS ont he different Stamp tho.
[6:21:52] <%Legato_Ambrose> And Zack will PROBABLY cross over to the timeline we play
[6:21:52] <%luftraumm1> stamp isn't constant it's he?
[6:21:53] <+Kairi__> in this timeline, why does Cloud thinks he was in SOILDER?
[6:21:53] <%baronblank> The Stamp shown on the chip bag in the Zack cutscene implies that it's a different universe since the dogs are different breeds
[6:21:53] <%Mornaka> NO BODY NO CRIME
[6:21:56] <tusk102> @PatStaresAt WAIT WHAT IF ZACK REPLACES CLOUD DURING THE MAKO POISONING SEGMENT?
[6:21:56] <%rezlam> STAMP GOT UPDATED IT'S SAID IN THE GAME! DOESN'T MEAN A DIFFERENT TIMELINE
[6:21:57] <%Legato_Ambrose> Through PORTALS
[6:21:58] <%DetroitSentai> He says his death line
[6:22:00] <+sevorai> He only survived because the plot ghosts were stopped
[6:22:04] <%the_vedo_show> 777
[6:22:04] <dogekingjojo> Stamp is different and it's not because they changed the mascot. Crisis core is just a few months away from ff7 beginning so there's not enough time for a full mascot overhaul. different timeline.
[6:22:05] <+justianxix> NO Important dies! YAAAY
[6:22:05] <Sp3ctre48> They explicitly showed that Stamp was a different breed, thats important
[6:22:07] <+younger54> No one gets off-screened
[6:22:09] <%transporterthesequel> Wait...wait, okay, so, Cloud and company WERE in the original timeline, then they kill fate, and maybe they are now in the alternate timeline?
[6:22:10] <%Doctadaking> I mean, we saw Biggs die too, but he’s alive
[6:22:12] <%Ancopro> it cut to black when he got smooshed by rocks and he lives sooo
[6:22:15] <TioXyco> @PatStaresAt there's now 3 timelines: Bad End (original game) Zack Lives and 7 remake timeline
[6:22:16] <hcsarg86> @RubberFistFight I'm relatively new so I'm not used to the big smugness yet
[6:22:17] <%ratreborn> "Logos change!!!" Except they went out of their way to slow the logo down so you can SEE its different,
[6:22:17] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> Why would they bother showing a different stamp if there wasn't some meaning to it?
[6:22:19] <%optimasmaximas> doodDed
[6:22:22] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Probably lots of different timelines now with no whispers to enforce that shit
[6:22:23] <dero45> If wedge is alive why
[6:22:24] <%Falilth> @PatStaresAt biggs literally was shown in a bed
[6:22:26] <+stoutfish> @PatStaresAt what if zack is alive, but he thinks he is cloud
[6:22:27] <%Guardiansaiyan> @transporterthesequel both parties in different timelines
[6:22:29] <+azure22900> Oh wait, the gang went INTO Zacks timeline.
[6:22:29] <+ghostfaceninja_> ALSO ZACK COULD TOTALLY DIE 10 SECONDS AFTER THAT CUTSCENE, ITS RAINING AND WE NEVER SEE HIM CROSS THE THRESHOLD OF MIDGAR
[6:22:30] <tusk102> @PatStaresAt what if Zack replaces Cloud during the mako poisoning segment?
[6:22:32] <%rumtumtugnutz> its CLEARLY Aerith that's fucking with the timeline.
[6:22:34] <+visidan> atpRtsd4
[6:22:34] <%RetroCop87> YES

[6:22:39] <xxmagonx> LUL
[6:22:40] <BlackermanZX> YES HE DID
[6:22:40] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> They focus so hard on cementing the imagery of one stamp, then introduce a different one at the very end.
[6:22:41] <+Marsidicus> You did

[6:22:54] <%Wurmspawn> @snugglepuggs If you'd like to watch a parody series that does a good job (in my opinion) of telling the story in a more explanatory way while also poking fun it the game's story with some comedy and exaggerated characters, then look up Final Fantasy Machinabridged by Teamfourstar on youtube.

[6:23:16] <%PenmanLupine> Hi Pat your Paige
[6:23:16] <+justianxix> NO
[6:23:16] <%0dokuro> Ya it would
[6:23:16] <%SilverDevilfish> That message is smart
[6:23:16] <TioXyco> @CelioHogane KH does not exist
[6:23:17] <%Piemono> Whenever Pat compliments Paige, he's actually just complimenting himself
[6:23:17] <%Dragon_Batman> @kaizerlith I was thinking something similar the question is after the final clash can he still control them or are they dead
[6:23:18] <+Lunarhawk> @PatStaresAt Did you play KH3? Cause if you didnt play 3 youre missing 90% of what people are talking about when comparing FF7R to KH - its not about 2
[6:23:20] <+ghostfaceninja_> BUT THEORIES ARE FUN THO
[6:23:22] <%drfaustisdead> Much fun.
[6:23:23] <%Aracon_> idk I'd rather get my answers sooner

[6:23:27] <+future_ry> pat is paige's living legacy
[6:23:27] <tusk102> @PatStaresAt Zack dies before it starts raining in Crisis Core, which is why they specifically made it start raining while Zack was passing by them
[6:23:28] <%zanzibar_junker> Development for part 2 started at November
[6:23:28] <%walternatorz> @PatStaresAt you need to start another predictions text file
[6:23:31] <%Aracon_> I don;t want another KH situation

[6:24:00] <artoflec> KH was a fucking great time and was stupid as hell
[6:24:01] <Axle13j> LUL
[6:24:03] <%CelioHogane> @CanadianAnimatorGuy make AERITH KILL CLOUD
[6:24:03] <%Nupinoop296> KH3 could have been better but i still like it
[6:24:04] <%narusao> LUL
[6:24:05] <%drfaustisdead> KH3 is the most disappointing sequel since Dark Souls 2.
[6:24:06] <%the_vedo_show> doodSweet go to hell
[6:24:07] <%j0ustar> BOP PED
[6:24:07] <%skizzuto> also didn't aerith have to die for holy to work properly or something
[6:24:08] <$KnivesEve> @PatStaresAt any plans to play smt4 or apocalypse in the furture?
[6:24:08] <Shardlab> Because KH strung people along for three console generations
[6:24:11] <%ape_hawk> again, my prediction is that the good end will be them saving sephiroth from going crazy
[6:24:11] <dogekingjojo> Aerith literally controls the lifestream to stop meteor. Without her the lifestream can't oppose sephiroth because it has no conciousness
[6:24:11] <Sp3ctre48> It also created Holy, so not killing Aerith is kinda fucking important for Seph
[6:24:12] <%Ipsenscastle> @YakumoYomi Mario was dreaming it all along
[6:24:12] <CSeriesJTYPE> can someone tell me what im supposed to be looking for on the story details screen about the 7 seconds thing
[6:24:12] <%TalisKanju> yeah Kirby
[6:24:15] <Warbot40> It is stupid...PLAY IT THO
[6:24:16] <+ghostfaceninja_> WE'RE ALL JUST HOPING THEY DON'T "LAST JEDI" THIS SHIT
[6:24:17] <+Lunarhawk> KH3 is fucking trash but there is so much of it in chapter 18 of this game lets be real
[6:24:17] <%Doctadaking> The double standards here are perplexing
[6:24:17] <Hyper_charger> Why is it bad when KH does it but not FF7?
[6:24:20] <%Typhaeon> @neutrall12 Yeah that "url" filter is very sensitive
[6:24:20] <%Solid_Stro> Aerith uses the lifestream after she dies to stop meteor
[6:24:23] <%Mornaka> @PatStaresAt Sephi was all smiles fighting just Cloud but as soon as the ladies showed up he got all pissy
[6:24:23] <%CelioHogane> @ape_hawk that would be great, actually
[6:24:25] <%Katashi25> Katashi25 is gifting 1 Tier 1 Subs to PatStaresAt's community! They've gifted a total of 2 in the channel! 
[6:24:26] <%Katashi25> Katashi25 gifted a Tier 1 sub to Bones8677! 
[6:24:30] <+michingmallecho> IF TIFA DIES THEN WE RIOT hasSmash
[6:24:31] <NiktenKing> Push Vincent into the sword, prevent DoC
[6:24:31] <%rytyoung> Agreeeed
[6:24:32] <joodatious> aerith takes up sephs sword and kills jessie
[6:24:32] <MsYakumo> My personal theory is that we have created a sort of Sound of Thunder situation. Beating the Whispers, which are non-linear entities, lead to Zack surviving. That scene we get with Zack passing Cloud and Aerith is like a time wave retroactively changing them as people... just like Aerith warned them if they succeeded.
[6:24:33] <%Verd_254> I feel like people who hate this game are doing it for similar reasons people did MGS2 back in the day. Either way, they're both wrong. doodMaxhype
[6:24:34] <%Axellogic> Happy Birthicus
[6:24:36] <%b9k9com> People like what they like. I like the ending to FF7R and I enjoy KH. ^_^
[6:24:36] <artoflec> @drfaustisdead hell no, dark souls 2 went backwards in a million ways, no way did 3 not advance over a ps2 and 3DS games lmao
[6:24:37] <%ShichiNoBushi> 3rd Birthday
[6:24:38] <%DakotaMacDoodle> honestly now that they are using a decent game engine part 2 could come out in 4 or 5 years
[6:24:42] <%Kriss1827> @hyper_charger cause most people actually care more about the ff7 characters than the KH ones
[6:24:44] <%213372bu> 7 Discs of Music for this game alone
[6:24:44] <%optimasmaximas> 🤔
[6:24:47] <%CelioHogane> WHAT IF PART 2 IS ALSO IN MIDGAR?
[6:24:49] <%ape_hawk> HOJO CHILLING WITH BEACH HONIES

[6:25:11] <%boogaleeboo> Part 2 is probably 2 years away, they've done a bunch of the model work already and they have the engine
[6:25:12] <%lewisleicester> rufus
[6:25:12] <+Delenay> there was a count down during his fight when meteor appeared... it was only 1 number tho, just eight
[6:25:12] <%Alopekis> Also the parade for Rufus!

[6:25:27] <+Kairi__> HOJO
[6:25:28] <%CelioHogane> @boogaleeboo could be in 2021 easily, actually.
[6:25:28] <joodatious> there's a couple dudes youll have to deal with
[6:25:29] <%Dragon_Batman> They can't , lawsuit shit
[6:25:31] <%rytyoung> GACKT IN BLACK I HIT THE SACK
[6:25:31] <KCFusecoast> So Sephiroth was great but it would be cool if Genesis appears in Part 2
[6:25:31] <%YakumoYomi> FINAL BOSS FROM CHRONO CROSS
[6:25:33] <MsYakumo> I for one look forward to a spinoff game where we play as Zack in Midgar.
[6:25:33] <%imthewisejanitor> I just want to see the Weapons.
[6:25:33] <%Quigsies> NOTHING WILL FORESTALL HIS RETURN
[6:25:34] <+aztecsaxwarrior> 1. Dark themes were toned down such as characters deaths during the plate fall and the slaughter following your incarceration at Shinra HQ which was also left out. 2. It's become infected by Kingdom Hearts nonsense of abstract concepts being given corporeal form for you to overcome by beating it up instead of being implied through character growth and actions.
[6:25:35] <%richmon_> @patstaresat tifa gettin banged on the rocks
[6:25:35] <+lojack69> Without drama or sacrifice, it just makes the journey seem pointless
[6:25:35] <%drfaustisdead> @artoflec It's narrative is so trash that most of the Disney characters state they don't care about the main plot.
[6:25:35] <%king_wragles> Gackt will be part 3 imo
[6:25:38] <hcsarg86> Sephiroth and Genesis merge to become Sephisis
[6:25:39] <dero45> doodRage I’m a dude playing a dude disguised as another dude
[6:25:42] <%tebari> cheer500 Happy birth and end of FF7R day Pat! What was your favorite part?
[6:25:43] <%CrazyRainbows> Evil Zack from an Alt World would be a trip but it'll probably be Gackt
[6:25:45] <Incognitohat> pat, Hojo mentions G-types in the board meeting, so do you think Genesis is coming back
[6:25:46] <%j0ustar> Nah I get the feeling FF7 might get a wee bit De-Gackted now
[6:25:47] <%segonian> and then part 3
[6:25:47] <%rumtumtugnutz> if the Golden Saucer doesn't have Hildy I'm out
[6:25:49] <OkoPoko> They'd have to pay Gackt A LOT of moneys to bring him back
[6:25:50] <%Owkono> I can't wait for the ff14 crossover with ff7r
[6:25:53] <%Bones8677> FF7 Remake 2 ends with CLOUD dying, and you control Zack for FF7 Remake 3
[6:25:54] <%TenderBabyBacon> Good End is Cloud does a zangief style piledriver to Sephiroth off of meteor into the earth
[6:25:54] <%Ynkubus18> Gackt just bleeds through other Gackt shit like Decade
[6:25:54] <+visidan> @aztecsaxwarrior atpShh
[6:25:55] <%DukeBlack_> genesis never died and Hojo/deep ground has his body
[6:25:58] <%42nfl19> @PatStaresAt So does Hojo know? or not know?
[6:25:58] <%optimasmaximas> @aztecsaxwarrior cry more

[6:26:02] <artoflec> @drfaustisdead yeah that was actually one of my favourite parts of the monsters inc guys just being confused while they rambled about stuff lmao. It was clearly very tongue and cheek.

[6:26:12] <%Xenokhrist> I want Snowboarding
[6:26:13] <%DukeBlack_> Barret sailor outfit
[6:26:14] <Ryan1016> The fact they don't kill Hojo at the beach is the funniest shit
[6:26:14] <%Dementedpenguin> I mean, they doubled down on Cloud in drag
[6:26:14] <%boogaleeboo> Hojo and the Turks getting just obliterated
[6:26:16] <+paladinstarbuster> HOJO FUCKS
[6:26:17] <Sp3ctre48> It's very shortsighted to think the way this ends will mean no drama or sacrifice, that's kinda the point
[6:26:18] <%Robot_Nixon_> I cant wait to slap Scarlet
[6:26:18] <%kaizerlith> This game makes me certain we will see that. They embraced the weirdest shit and it was great.
[6:26:20] <%Dragon_Batman> Yea
[6:26:20] <+michingmallecho> HOMO
[6:26:21] <+aztecsaxwarrior> 3. Motivation to defeat SEPHIROTH felt forced here unlike in the OG where his threat is escalated across the entire game. In the OG, Tifa and Cloud want vengeance for personal reasons that evolves in to saving the planet which brings the others on board. In Remake though, Aerith says he's bad so that's good enough for everyone apparently. 4. Time travel/multiverse concepts are, more often then not, a crutch for garbage story telling because it creates far too many holes and wtf questions
[6:26:22] <Shardlab> Hojo on his vacation with corporately mandated hoes
[6:26:24] <%optimasmaximas> HELL HOUSE!?
[6:26:25] <%ape_hawk> ITS THE BEST THO
[6:26:25] <%CrazyRainbows> IT"S SO GOOD
[6:26:25] <%Typhaeon> My take is that the FATE GHOSTS will play less of a role, if any, in the sequel, so people's issues with their presence in ther game will be minimized
[6:26:26] <%spiritofmojave> HEEEEEEEEELLHOUSE

[6:27:35] <%luftraumm1> there are some stupid enemies in nibel
[6:27:35] <+aztecsaxwarrior> The plot literally just turns into Dirge of Cerberus Advent Children bullshit. mixed with Kingdom Hearts.
[6:27:36] <%Legato_Ambrose> Cait Sith's forunes will come out as fucking Zalgo text.
[6:27:37] <%gambit_gamble> I dont think he would care
[6:27:37] <%arcaderabbit48> He knows, he's just in denial
[6:27:38] <%ringabal> Vincent broods in the background
[6:27:39] <nyacoo> He doesn't know at all
[6:27:39] <@JustinianKnight> He might

[6:27:44] <%Garthunox> @alopekis THIS ISNT EVEN A HILL
[6:27:46] <%Dementedpenguin> Yuffie's VA better be great
[6:27:47] <hcsarg86> @Katashi25 Does Aerith still die in that comic?
[6:27:52] <@JustinianKnight> but it probably doesnt matter
[6:27:53] <%Verd_254> THE MADLADS
[6:27:53] <toomuchsnarfsnarf> hmmmmm

[6:28:11] <%ape_hawk> SEPHIROTH IS CRAZY, TOO
[6:28:11] <%Doctadaking> Yuffie better be Mae Whitman (Katara) again
[6:28:11] <%nofestu2> clyde?
[6:28:13] <b_ikki> yeah you see cloud kinda struggle
[6:28:13] <%Darkfire346> I dont think he ever learns it in the OG
[6:28:16] <%optimasmaximas> yup
[6:28:16] <Reilata> He does use him as a puppet. So.
[6:28:19] <%b1gboss007> the Chad Nomura vs the virgin purist psaDab psaDab psaDab
[6:28:20] <%Alopekis> Yeah, Sephiroth is kind of a dick
[6:28:21] <%ahdurian> oh god what if they put that in the Remake Part 2?
[6:28:22] <%YakumoYomi> Wasn't that Jenova?
[6:28:22] <+Ominnous> tbf, Sephiroth used to be his idol
[6:28:22] <+jiggy_snipe> Sephiroth is a jackass
[6:28:24] <%ringabal> Cloud: "I'm so fucked up."
[6:28:26] <+regularjimmy88> That ain't happening in the sequel
[6:28:28] <%tigerfang86> SMALL FISTS
[6:28:29] <%Garthunox> @doctadaking no
[6:28:30] <%tigerfang86> BABY FISTS
[6:28:31] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Well yeah but everyone beats on Aerith tho
[6:28:32] <%spiritofmojave> I REALLY wonder if that beatdown will be kept in
[6:28:35] <+PlagueOfGripes> Sephiroth just seems to enjoy fucking with Cloud instead of changing the past in a less dumb way. Good for him
[6:28:37] <%arcaderabbit48> Violently. Like, that shit would not fly today cause they're not just Lego people anymore
[6:28:37] <+swaggopotamus> Hojo's absurdly sleazy portrayal in this game makes it even worse that Lucrecia cucked Vincent with him.
[6:28:38] <%CelioHogane> @ahdurian i doubt Part 2 is going to reach that
[6:28:41] <+lojack69> We calling the second part FF7-2 or FF7 Unmade?
[6:28:45] <%MattzosoSA> AERITH MMA. FUND IT, DANA
[6:28:45] <+michingmallecho> hasSmash
[6:28:45] <%D3rrtyD4n> LOL
[6:28:46] <%DukeBlack_> So you think he's gonna choke or punch Aerith?
[6:28:47] <Andrizzleton> True if True
[6:28:47] <ovan20> BABY MAD FISTS rooREE
[6:28:48] <%Alopekis> You guys thing Tseng was being controlled by Sephiroth when he slapped Aerith?
[6:28:49] <%Robot_Nixon_> CiGrip
[6:28:50] <%miguelrod777> LUL
[6:28:51] <@SoFarFetched> BUT PAIGE NEEDS TO KNOW
[6:28:52] <%snugglepuggs> surprised how much self-control Cloud has to even fight Sephiroth this early in the game
[6:28:54] <Blackscience91> I wonder if Seph will actually learn about his birth parents?
[6:28:56] <%optimasmaximas> @ringabal goddamit i just imagined cloud doing that to tifa NotLikeThis
[6:28:56] <Thalchampz> NEVER MIND THAT SHIIT
[6:28:57] <%boogaleeboo> I mean Cloud is like 17, he and Zack were in cyrosleep for 4 years. Of course he's little!
[6:28:57] <%spiritofmojave> NEVERMIND THAT SHIT
[6:28:59] <%Typhaeon> Oh shit it's Steve McMichael
[6:29:04] <%j0ustar> Here comes Paige with 300 Mangos
[6:29:08] <%optimasmaximas> WOW
[6:29:09] <%Garthunox> HERE COMES MONGO
[6:29:10] <Kashi_Nin> Hey everyone! Did I actually show up at the end again?
[6:29:10] <%luftraumm1> Mongo the big baby
[6:29:15] <Tha_Mik> What a hero
[6:29:16] <neVan0> DEDICATED
[6:29:20] <MsYakumo> I super look forward to that spoiler cast.
[6:29:22] <%weissguard> Cloud: Lucina, eat your HEART OUT.
[6:29:23] <%spiritofmojave> @kashi_nin yep yep!
[6:29:24] <hcsarg86> Palmer survives being hit by the truck pat
[6:29:25] <%Hegelundra> hey does anyone know how to write a sub message?
[6:29:33] <%kaizerlith> I am really curious about why Rufus could see the whispers but Tseng couldn't.
[6:29:33] <Kashi_Nin> good 'ol me lol
[6:29:35] <%tigerfang86> hmmmmm
[6:29:37] <Sagata_> thats why its not that
[6:29:37] <%Valdorick> Hey wait, isn't Cloud still Mind Controled and not unfucked during this ending?
[6:29:38] <+PlagueOfGripes> well, the lifestream would have helped regardless
[6:29:38] <%tigerfang86> hmmmmmmmmmm
[6:29:39] <%CelioHogane> I am 100% CERTAIN that part 2 is not going to go beyond Cosmo Canyon.
[6:29:40] <%spiritofmojave> lmao
[6:29:41] <%goldenchaos96> do you remember the enemy in northern cave thats basically HOT WOMAN (Pollensalta)
[6:29:43] <+PlagueOfGripes> Holy just wouldn't have been summoned
[6:29:45] <%Doctadaking> Save her from me(????)
[6:29:45] <%Typhaeon> "Somebody stop me" -Jim Carrey and/or Sephiroth
[6:29:45] <%Alopekis> Unless he has different motives.
[6:29:47] <%ape_hawk> MASH TRIANGLE TO SAVE AERITH
[6:29:48] <joodatious> aerith dying is what caused seph to lose
[6:29:51] <%CrazyRainbows> I swear to god if they try to make Seph a good guy I'm going to lose it
[6:29:54] <b_ikki> yeah her spirit needs to go to the lifestream
[6:29:55] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Yes
[6:29:55] <dogekingjojo> QTE stab Aerith
[6:29:55] <Sp3ctre48> yes
[6:29:57] <%0dokuro> Yup
[6:29:57] <%shiny_prinny> yes
[6:29:57] <%Valdorick> Like, in the OG, Cloud gets over his shit, and so isn't mind controllable anymore.
[6:29:58] <%optimasmaximas> yup
[6:29:58] <+Tokanova> her death lets her guide holy so it doesn't kil humanity, it might kill humantiy this time
[6:29:58] <Shardlab> Oh.... FF7 Remake is Blazblue!
[6:30:00] <%tigerfang86> yes
[6:30:00] <%baronblank> he's not talking about saving aerith according to the game
[6:30:00] <Dova573> So SHE MUST DIE
[6:30:01] <%A_DEAD_SHOW> !uptime
[6:30:01] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 6h 30m.
[6:30:01] <%j0ustar> I highly doubt she survives
[6:30:03] <%CelioHogane> @CrazyRainbows i really hope it's happening
[6:30:05] <%0dokuro> She must die
[6:30:07] <%Wurmspawn> If you mute a stream it doesn't matter if it's on screen, your view doesn't count.
[6:30:08] <%Mornaka> SOUND CLIP
[6:30:09] <%de1ete_forever> yup pretty much
[6:30:10] <ovan20> LUL
[6:30:10] <+FairOnFire> aw bitch, eeehhhhh
[6:30:11] <Graxe_> Sephiroth was able to keep Holy completely contained
[6:30:11] <SubjectULTIMA> 7 seconds until the end of the planet. It has nothing to do with Aerith
[6:30:11] <%Alopekis> He saw his moment, and he took it.
[6:30:11] <TheyCallMeVawn> She has to do die for them to win
[6:30:11] <fruit_pie_the_magician> What if Meteor isn't even part of his plan anymore
[6:30:11] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> exactly, he's telling Cloud to "win" so that really he loses
[6:30:12] <%spiritofmojave> BITCH
[6:30:12] <%GarbageQueenEllie> He thought he could stop her
[6:30:12] <%AllenDeadman> he did not know
[6:30:13] <%DukeBlack_> "He must win"
[6:30:13] <%TalisKanju> Aerith sacrificed herself?
[6:30:14] <+stoutfish> He did it to make cloud suffer
[6:30:14] <%kekkerscrew> kekkerscrew subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months! Yes Sephiroth's motivation to go crazy in FF7 is that he thinks he's just some experiment and Jenova's his mom. He doesn't know he has 2 living parents
[6:30:14] <%RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt that "eat mango before toking up" thing is an old wive's tale, there's basically 0 evidence for it. There's claims that it's because they're "high in vitamin A", but when you ask why other vitamin A sources don't mimic the behaviour, all you get is crickets chirping and maybe a polite cough.
[6:30:14] <%conradical> do it one more time
[6:30:15] <%Felto3> he was trying to stop the cast
[6:30:15] <%j0ustar> She MUST die
[6:30:15] <+paladinstarbuster> LUL
[6:30:16] <+Remery_> Fuck the healer
[6:30:17] <@JustinianKnight> he probably thought it would harm his plans
[6:30:17] <+michingmallecho> FF7-2 reunion, FF7-3 reminder
[6:30:17] <%Aracon_> just kill cloud, and make zack and aerith wombo combo sephiroth
[6:30:17] <%213372bu> I think Sephiroth is going to be our ally by the end
[6:30:17] <zamzoph> Then he T-poses
[6:30:17] <%spiritofmojave> LUL
[6:30:18] <%conradical> nice
[6:30:18] <%walternatorz> he didn't know that would trigger holy
[6:30:19] <%tigerfang86> he A POSES
[6:30:20] <Kashi_Nin> I always get home right as these end. At least I have my personality.
[6:30:20] <%linSP> SHE MUST WIN
[6:30:21] <%Tenkay> This time he goes to kill her and she hits him with the chair
[6:30:21] <%Alopekis> ...........COOLRANCH
[6:30:21] <%DetroitSentai> They want us to think she'll live so her dying will still hit hard
[6:30:22] <%DakotaMacDoodle> Sephiroth it trying to stop himself
[6:30:23] <%tigerfang86> wait no he T POSES
[6:30:23] <Blackscience91> Sephiroth hates Cloud because, in his mind, He got cheap shotted by a weak bitch. And that can not be tolerated.
[6:30:24] <%the_vedo_show> atpRtsd atpRtsd hold this Aerith
[6:30:25] <%spiritofmojave> then he t-poses
[6:30:26] <%conradical> "ah bitch ehhhhh"
[6:30:26] <%arcaderabbit48> He wanted to stop Holy, and accidentally gave Aeriths more power
[6:30:26] <JanusII> It's not cool though his mom is there.
[6:30:26] <KaironFortressKnight> more like he thought he was stopping holy
[6:30:30] <%Wurmspawn> He did it because HUBRIS!
[6:30:31] <joodatious> its about him killing her at the wrong time
[6:30:31] <+earthboy2k> cool ranch LUL
[6:30:33] <%Solid_Stro> doodSwear brownKOBE doodNuts
[6:30:33] <%kaizerlith> Rufus
[6:30:35] <Andrizzleton> Sephy loved to T pose
[6:30:35] <%richmon_> jenova did it right?
[6:30:37] <%RubberFistFight> Nippleheim?
[6:30:37] <GenericSoda> I thought he killed her because he was trying to stop her from calling Holy?
[6:30:37] <+jiggy_snipe> I think Holy was active and Sephiroth had to hold it back. It released after he died but Meteor was too close
[6:30:37] <%ringabal> YEYEYEYE
[6:30:38] <+regularjimmy88> I think Holy works without her, but Aerith being dead is what stopped it wiping out the human race.
[6:30:39] <%Alopekis> Yes
[6:30:39] <%cowardman93> A POSE!
[6:30:40] <+TombstoneTTromboners> Cloud and Zack killing Sephiroth with a X-Cut

[6:30:47] <b_ikki> it's destruct
[6:30:47] <%SH1NK1R0> @patstaresat sephiroth first appearance in the remake is leading cloud away from aerith so he doesn’t meet her and tells him to run away and live. The ghosts appear immediately after to force them to meet

[6:37:18] <%Kiyosuki> It's gonna be so sick whatever it is I bet.
[6:37:20] <%j0ustar> The lifestream is like "The fuck is this"
[6:37:21] <%Typhaeon> Sephiroth is Nyarlathotep
[6:37:22] <artoflec> oh so hes Xehanort
[6:37:24] <steamlord23> The Zack thing implies an alt timeline...since that stamp was different. That's my take, anyway.
[6:37:25] <zamzoph> That makes sense
[6:37:28] <%Doctadaking> A concept stolen for Xehanort
[6:37:28] <%de1ete_forever> don't worry about this Trigun shit
[6:37:28] <%optimasmaximas> LUL
[6:37:28] <%Alopekis> Isn't that a clone?
[6:37:29] <%tigerfang86> YES
[6:37:29] <+regularjimmy88> Calamity from the Skies is a cool moniker
[6:37:31] <%tigerfang86> BASICALLY
[6:37:32] <%boogaleeboo> It's "copy" in Japanese, a copy of the process that made Sephiroth
[6:37:35] <Vlisragna> Jenova is actually brain dead. Has been since ancient times. From the very beginning, Sephiroth has been the one controlling and manipulating HER
[6:37:37] <b_ikki> LITERALLY FLY
[6:37:37] <Sp3ctre48> FF7 has a weird story
[6:37:40] <%RubberFistFight> Jenova happened because Lavos had a booty call with The Thing CONFIRMED
[6:37:41] <%Legato_Ambrose> She's The Thing, but you want to fuck it
[6:37:45] <%cache_22> Sephiroth is Liquid Ocelot?
[6:37:50] <%Owkono> Just watch the spirits within, its the same story
[6:37:51] <dero45> So orochimaru
[6:37:53] <%Dragon_Batman> It's a bit more clear with reunion clones
[6:37:53] <%spiritofmojave> @dragon_batman yeah, him and Ryuji both I swear. Also you're tot right I could see that happening!
[6:37:53] <%GarbageQueenEllie> That sounds so annoying
[6:37:54] <joodatious> i already wanted to fuck the thing
[6:37:58] <%Alopekis> 50
[6:37:58] <%Dementedpenguin> FF7R2 needs Kurt Russel

[6:40:01] <TheFramedWarlock> Nomura FailFish

[6:40:26] <+megamanx74> it's funny to feel that red was shoehorn in even though he was in the original events. the characters don't acknowledge him other than barret and cloud.
[6:40:27] <%GarbageQueenEllie> mwahahahaha
[6:40:28] <b_ikki> based answer
[6:40:28] <%thackattack00> What about all the interviews where they said the core story would remain faithful?

[6:40:32] <Ner234> NOMURAAAAA
[6:40:35] <%TimetodiveLTX> the real answer is you need to have been exposed to this shit since the 90s
[6:40:35] <%j0ustar> In other words "Hey play both!"
[6:40:36] <%rytyoung> WATCH THE REBUILDS FIRST BASICALLY
[6:40:36] <%boogaleeboo> The core story was the same
[6:40:39] <%Alopekis> BeepBeepBoopBopBipBop
[6:40:40] <%Dragon_Batman> IT still is largley faithful
[6:40:41] <night__monkey> they had to make it a sequel because they didn't want to make a whole open world for the next part LUL
[6:40:41] <%Kiyosuki> Also can we just talk about this games' soundtrack?

[6:40:47] <tusk102> @PatStaresAt Cloud gets replaced during the mako poisoning segment with Zack maybe?
[6:40:48] <%boogaleeboo> The overwhelming majority of events are the same
[6:40:48] <Andrizzleton> so much of ff7R doesn't make sense unless you've played FF7 and it's spinoffs
[6:40:48] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> So yeah, this game is a sequel
[6:40:52] <%ringabal> @PatStaresAt I can't believe you called it during the gang kicking Cloud out of the Reactor 5 mission
[6:40:56] <%Dragon_Batman> Yep
[6:40:56] <%j0ustar> You know SOMETHING
[6:40:56] <+justianxix> Half the people wouldn't be so angry if they actually told you what this game is
[6:40:57] <%imthewisejanitor> I felt SO much during this game that I don't think I would have felt if I hadn't played the first one.
[6:40:59] <%ape_hawk> the game LITERALLY HELPED SELL THE PS1
[6:40:59] <Shardlab> 23 years of bloody osmosis
[6:41:00] <%snugglepuggs> it's so interesting seeing all the callbacks early in the Remake to the OG and later in the Remake like hallucinations of the plate falling in Chapter 2

[6:41:40] <CookieCutter007> DO IT
[6:41:41] <%spiritofmojave> LUL
[6:41:41] <LorcaNomad> so realistically speaking they sort of HAVE to change it
[6:41:41] <%Dragon_Batman> Oh really?
[6:41:42] <%thackattack00> I hope so
[6:41:42] <%snugglepuggs> the Aerith spoiler helped me not waste time leveling her up
[6:41:44] <%SvenHolgersson> Kill Cloud
[6:41:45] <%rytyoung> It's the equivalent of everyone know who Luke Skywalkers dad is
[6:41:45] <+jiggy_snipe> why?
[6:41:45] <Ryan1016> Aerith is 100% going to die
[6:41:46] <Reilata> I'm excited for new things.
[6:41:46] <+megamanx74> @Shwepie oh damn! thanks for clearing that up
[6:41:46] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> I WILL BE FINE WITH IT
[6:41:46] <%rezlam> You're right Pat, it's the perfect way to subvert and hype up expectations and get people talking about the game

[6:41:47] <%spiritofmojave> MAYBE THAT WOULD BE THE POINT
[6:41:47] <%Yakobro> LUL
[6:41:48] <%Garthunox> @paladinstarbuster MY MAN!
[6:41:48] <%shootbang_exe> that's kinda dumb though lol
[6:41:48] <%j0ustar> @turbofolk it's fine. There's like 10 versions of original FF7 you can get.
[6:41:49] <%tigerfang86> I WANT MY POWER OF FRIENDSHIP GOLDEN ENDING
[6:41:49] <zamzoph> Nomura giving you hope to kill her again
[6:41:49] <%ape_hawk> stab her through the brain, got it
[6:41:50] <%Alopekis> What if she explodes, killing Sephiroth with her?
[6:41:50] <CrazyMedicine> Omnislash Her !
[6:41:51] <+aztecsaxwarrior> Kill Cloud, replace with ZACH
[6:41:51] <%Emperor_Machinus> Gets stabbed from the from instead
[6:41:52] <%fetrigon> LUL
[6:41:52] <b_ikki> you'll get it 20 minutes after
[6:41:53] <%MoonObscure> not again NotLikeThis
[6:41:53] <Axle13j> LUL
[6:41:53] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> WHY?!
[6:41:54] <%spiritofmojave> YEAH
[6:41:54] <%GohanHitsugaya> It's the most well known spoiler aside from Darth Vader is Lukes father...
[6:41:54] <%GarbageQueenEllie> She may just die in a different way. Maybe she'll even kill HERSELF!
[6:41:54] <%optimasmaximas> YEAH.....WAIT
[6:41:55] <%Dakuu75> NEW depressing shit!! lol
[6:41:55] <%Alazull> I don't think it will be the same, especially considering the scenes they showed
[6:41:56] <%TruSanKyuu> Rip Tifa
[6:41:56] <MattoBii> They'll make you think you can save her, just to twist the knife
[6:41:57] <+Remery_> NEW FEELS
[6:41:57] <Sp3ctre48> Yeah different depressing shit
[6:41:58] <neutrall12> i wish I got to experience aerith dying without any knowledge. must have been intense
[6:41:58] <dogekingjojo> Same. Make NEW shit. The old shit is boring now
[6:41:58] <%Zebroneath> MAKE ME NEW SAD
[6:41:59] <toomuchsnarfsnarf> BIG SAD
[6:42:00] <%Kiyosuki> What if who dies is choice tally based?
[6:42:02] <+PlagueOfGripes> Tifa will have the most resonance. Kill the beefers
[6:42:05] <%Felto3> what if zack kills aerith
[6:42:05] <+Remery_> Barret got penetrated
[6:42:06] <DratSouma> i need variety in my depression
[6:42:07] <%Legato_Ambrose> "Then gots brings back to life"
[6:42:07] <%DXLelouch24> Kill her at Northern Crater
[6:42:07] <PinkSocks> You even fight Jenova right after Barret dies
[6:42:08] <%Aracon_> and now the ghosts are gone
[6:42:09] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> I HOPE SHE DIES SUPER FUCKING HARD
[6:42:09] <Shardlab> Letting that sassy girl go out fighting would be so much better
[6:42:11] <tusk102> @PatStaresAt Zack replaces Cloud during the Mako poisoning segment maybe?
[6:42:11] <%Alopekis> Then the ghosts get super murdered
[6:42:11] <Monkeyweed21> Aerith NEEDS to die to stop Meteor tho
[6:42:13] <%supersugoisenpai1> "The unknown journey will continue"
[6:42:14] <%ShichiNoBushi> But the ghosts would make sure Aerith dies.
[6:42:14] <+michingmallecho> Zack will die
[6:42:15] <%Keyd00d> She'll die 2 hours later
[6:42:15] <%Hegelundra> @PatStaresAt twitch ate my sub message for some reason (i think it's because i got gifted a sub without knowing it before subbing myself) but i wanna ask if ff7 is going back on the schedule anytime soon, i really wanna know who zach and jenova is.
[6:42:15] <%Emperor_Machinus> Ghosts dead now though?
[6:42:15] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> and now they've killed the ghosts
[6:42:17] <%richmon_> pat vs max
[6:42:18] <%boogaleeboo> The most resonance would probably be Barret for me
[6:42:19] <%YakumoYomi> @PlagueOfGripes No, Eli!
[6:42:19] <%Alazull> @PatStaresAt Did you notice the ghost that popped out of Barret almost looked sorry?
[6:42:20] <zamzoph> ghost CPR
[6:42:22] <%Darkfire346> THE FIRST 30 SECONDS OF PART 2 WILL BE AERITHS HEAD GETTING BLOWN OFF BY A SHOTGUN
[6:42:22] <%SirGO0SE> I would not trade Aerith for Tifa fuck you
[6:42:22] <+aztecsaxwarrior> ZACH KILLS CLOUD
[6:42:23] <%Typhaeon> I hope they are less afraid to show violence in future
[6:42:23] <%ringabal> I hope Cloud gets wheelchair combat
[6:42:25] <%Ancopro> who ever you build the most affinity with will die Kappa
[6:42:28] <%snugglepuggs> Even knowing Aerith dies. seeing the scene and aftermath made me produce manly tears
[6:42:31] <%Quigsies> One's a crystal
[6:42:31] <%Kiyosuki> If they kill Tifa people will riot, so yeah it'll be probably the other most resonant loss.
[6:42:31] <%Mornaka> Tiffa's Tiffies must survive!
[6:42:31] <%shadowace2400> 1 living parent
[6:42:32] <b_ikki> lucrecia is a fucking hobo in a cave
[6:42:32] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> What if Zack kills Cloud's gay virginity?
[6:42:32] <%optimasmaximas> LUL
[6:42:34] <chocolate_matter> She’s probably gonna die.
[6:42:36] <%LaughingCatt> He's HOJO's son
[6:42:38] <%shadowace2400> the other's a crystal
[6:42:38] <%baronblank> my current theory based on basically nothing is that sephy is gonna fuck with cloud even harder than the original game and he's gonna split from the party for some reason or another much earlier than his coma in the original
[6:42:38] <artoflec> people, try not to cry about it when people rub it in your face when that's exactly what happens though
[6:42:38] <%Dakuu75> his dad is hojo... that alone would make him nutz
[6:42:38] <terribleusername> the longer your sword is, the more crazy you are
[6:42:39] <%ape_hawk> pat, he was stable until nibelheim
[6:42:39] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Get over it Seph
[6:42:39] <joodatious> barret dying would break everyones heart
[6:42:40] <%SvenHolgersson> Thats stupid
[6:42:40] <%LaughingCatt> HOJO
[6:42:41] <TigerClaws12> @Monkeyweed21 he ain't gonna cast meteor anymore, that's his last groundhog day attempt LUL
[6:42:41] <+Ploobie> Lucrecia loves him.
[6:42:41] <Captpease> If I have a friend who has never played final fantasy, and doesn’t know Aerith dies, should I make him play the original?
[6:42:42] <%Shwepie> What if Aerith sends Tifa in to pray for Holy?
[6:42:42] <+jiggy_snipe> his mom loved him
[6:42:43] <+PlagueOfGripes> His mother lives stationary in a cave
[6:42:43] <%Valdorick> I can't wait for Zack to be a Jenova clone all along.
[6:42:43] <ThighsSupreme> I’m just glad ghost are gone now for future games
[6:42:45] <ZE_Count> Lucretia is weird
[6:42:45] <%Roundelay11> lucretia is a dumb bitch
[6:42:45] <%Dementedpenguin> @Darkfire346 No, that's too early. People can refund the game LUL
[6:42:46] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> Hojo "loves" him
[6:42:47] <NiktenKing> Hojo doesn't love him... Lucretia might
[6:42:47] <Shardlab> Yeah, if Aerith has to get fridged, at least let it be stopping Meteor
[6:42:49] <%SvenHolgersson> I want good guy Sephi
[6:42:50] <%Alpha8087> Zenos-- I mean Sephiroth, lol
[6:42:52] <Huntercd> The ghosts are stupid and add nothing to the story
[6:42:52] <%optimasmaximas> oh yeah
[6:42:53] <%tigerfang86> Zack is NORMAL
[6:42:53] <kentrix11> Lucretcia DOES LOVE HIM THOUGH, she ask for him.
[6:42:55] <%spiritofmojave> One parent, and its a weird SPACE MONSTER. I mean THAT'S INSANE.
[6:42:57] <%tigerfang86> NOBODY KNOWS why
[6:42:58] <%Alopekis> All Sephiroth ever needed was a hug and an "I love you, son."
[6:42:58] <%TenguGemini> finding out Hojo is your dad is enough to drive a person to madness
[6:42:58] <%Faustgesicht> Aerith's gonna die an d no one will ask for anything ff7 again
[6:42:59] <%snugglepuggs> his mom loves him in secret cave
[6:42:59] <hcsarg86> Lucreia love him didn't she
[6:43:02] <%KawaiiJetty> Wheelchair Cloud or bust
[6:43:03] <DratSouma> Zack is crazily cheerful
[6:43:03] <%DukeBlack_> Zack never did the mako shit right?
[6:43:04] <MattoBii> things would have gone very different if Zack stayed in the Nibelheim basement to provide Sephiroth emotional support
[6:43:04] <%iosephe> as far as we know
[6:43:04] <+Qliphoth_Rhizome> Kunsel tho
[6:43:05] <%zestyArsenic> zach is pretty dumb tho
[6:43:05] <tusk102> Zack is VERY normal by comparison
[6:43:05] <%TimetodiveLTX> Zach is pathologically optimistic
[6:43:05] <%transporterthesequel> IS Zack normal though?
[6:43:06] <@JustinianKnight> Zack has too much GOOBER energy
[6:43:07] <Monkeyweed21> ZACK IS A MANIC DEPRESSIVE OBSESSED WITH BEING A HERO
[6:43:07] <%boogaleeboo> Zack doesn't even get phased by death
[6:43:07] <%NopeBadguy> EVEN ZACK IS KIND OF A GOOFBALL, BUT HE'S TAME COMPARED TO EVERYONE ELSE
[6:43:09] <+ChuckBartowskiX> very true, every soldier is a homicidal maniac like roche at least
[6:43:09] <%Aracon_> Because zack is the BEST character from all of FF7
[6:43:10] <TheyCallMeVawn> Nah Zack is still super crazy with his hero mindset
[6:43:11] <%Nupinoop296> Greatest Soldier in the World, Sephiroth! Kappa
[6:43:12] <%cowardman93> even Zack is insane about being a hero
[6:43:12] <Reilata> With mind controlled alien juice stuck all inside him, crazy seems like it will jsut happen.
[6:43:13] <+PlagueOfGripes> Zack and Seph are the only Soldiers we ever see in the original, afair
[6:43:15] <+Delenay> the messed up hologram has barret and tifa dieing to sefi ... now sefi did get barret but no ghosts are around to save tifa
[6:43:16] <%Piemono> Cloud and Barrett become the cannon OTP
[6:43:17] <mothdude> Hojo being your parent is worse than Jenovs being your parent.
[6:43:17] <%rumtumtugnutz> Tifa can't die, She and Cloud need to fuck in a dirty chocobo cage under a bridge!
[6:43:18] <ralphfromdk> That's why he had to die :o Can't have any sane soldiers running around.
[6:43:22] <+younger54> I assume all the faceless soldier 3rds and 2nds you kill in OG are just normal dudes
[6:43:22] <TigerClaws12> @DukeBlack_ Zack was in the mako shit with cloud in Crisis Core
[6:43:23] <Captpease> @plagueofgripes If I have a friend who has never played final fantasy, and doesn’t know Aerith dies, should I make him play the original?
[6:43:23] <dogekingjojo> Aerith knows EVERYTHING
[6:43:24] <%ape_hawk> aerith gets glimpses
[6:43:24] <%Kiyosuki> I feel like Aerith needing to die is going to become a major plot point because doesn't her not dying benefit him the most if he's trying to change things?
[6:43:25] <Shardlab> I think he's just lacking in fear and doubt
[6:43:26] <%Aracon_> aerith only knows up to her death I think
[6:43:28] <%j0ustar> Zack was the first "Normal" one into soldier 1st class if you think about it
[6:43:28] <%Alopekis> Wait
[6:43:29] <%kaizerlith> She doesn't seem to know everything but she knows big stuff.
[6:43:31] <b_ikki> arith is probably being nudged by the lifestream but no straight up told everything
[6:43:31] <Sp3ctre48> I'm wondering if she only knows up to where she dies
[6:43:32] <%chaplianarthos> zack is just steve Rogers
[6:43:32] <%Alopekis> What about Angeal?
[6:43:33] <%MattzosoSA> Paige why you break dish
[6:43:34] <@JustinianKnight> you fight some SOLDIERs in Shinra HQ in the og
[6:43:35] <%Keyd00d> You assume
[6:43:36] <%DukeBlack_> oh yeah
[6:43:38] <%tigerfang86> Aerith doesn't know EVERYTHING but she KNOWS that it's all laid out for her
[6:43:39] <%Kiyosuki> Maybe he's going to manipulate Cloud to save Aerith, and that'll actually result in bad things
[6:43:40] <Monkeyweed21> Zack is obsessed with heroism remember
[6:43:40] <%AllenDeadman> angeal was also kinda nuts
[6:43:41] <%Darkfire346> AERITH 100% Knows how she dies
[6:43:41] <@JustinianKnight> and a couple other spots
[6:43:42] <%Alazull> Also the burial
[6:43:43] <%spiritofmojave> Correct
[6:43:44] <joodatious> I'm really worried Barret will die. they give him so much play in this including a big speech and emotional moments
[6:43:45] <@JustinianKnight> but just 3rd class
[6:43:46] <+aztecsaxwarrior> So in the first game you kill God at the Edge of Creation, then in the second one. some other stuff happens.
[6:43:47] <%Alopekis> @PatStaresAt Wasn't Angeal pretty normal?
[6:43:49] <%luftraumm1> aerith know everything, but she doesn't know she knows
[6:43:49] <thebiggestsharkdrake> How long ago did this stream start?
[6:43:51] <%Doctadaking> Like I said, Aerith NEEDS to explain herself at the beginning of next game. The jig is up, the party knows that she knows shit. They’d better question it.
[6:43:52] <%tigerfang86> she knows her entire fate was set in stone from the start
[6:43:53] <$Fortunato5678> Cloud saw himself lowering SOMEONE into the water
[6:43:53] <%Roundelay11> I think that Aerith only knew shit up until they left Midgar, she doesn't know whats going to happen know that they fucked up the fate ghosts
[6:43:53] <%DXLelouch24> If Tifa dies the game cant continue as no one else can fix Cloud thus its an automatic game over the end
[6:43:54] <%Aracon_> I doubt she knows past her death
[6:43:55] <dogekingjojo> She knows literally everything leading up to her death.
[6:43:55] <+PlagueOfGripes> they'll probably have a dumb scene later of Aerith demanding that she NEED to die
[6:43:56] <%Mornaka> WHAT
[6:43:56] <%tigerfang86> WHOA
[6:43:57] <%Alopekis> What?

[6:45:05] <%snugglepuggs> @patstaresat you're wrong in the part where Cloud and Aerith sneak out to go back to Sector 7 Cloud witnesses her death which is why he produced a tear.
[6:45:05] <%spiritofmojave> That'd be really good
[6:45:05] <%tigerfang86> T R U E
[6:45:05] <%Sir_stride> cids rhe best
[6:45:05] <+PlagueOfGripes> that's still really abusive sounding. more so actually
[6:45:05] <+jiggy_snipe> I mean Cid was alwats a dick but people are reading into the domestic abuse
[6:45:08] <%Doctadaking> Will we even get Cid next game? Or the one after it?
[6:45:11] <%imthewisejanitor> That's gonna be it, for sure.
[6:45:16] <Sp3ctre48> Nah
[6:45:16] <%SvenHolgersson> LET ZACH LIVE HE DESERVES IT
[6:45:17] <+chaumiester> Do you think Cid will be super Hot as well as every other character here?
[6:45:17] <%Aracon_> aerith dies for zack
[6:45:21] <%SvenHolgersson> WAY MORE THAN CLOUD
[6:45:21] <%CelioHogane> IF CLOUD DOES IT
[6:45:22] <%spiritofmojave> Uh huh?
[6:45:24] <%ape_hawk> One of Cids new Limit Breaks will just be him beating his wife
[6:45:25] <%Guardiansaiyan> @Doctadaking we do get Cid next game
[6:45:25] <%Keyd00d> That's also not good to do
[6:45:26] <Onmi_Khaos> @PlagueOfGripes Hell no, they've gone on record that the reason they did Aerith's death the way they did was because they didn't want to promote the culture of "Heroic Hollywood Sacrifice"
[6:45:27] <DratSouma> Only reason I would be on purist side is to get the under the highwind scene
[6:45:28] <%televisedrevolting> Just do what FF7 Abridged did.
[6:45:28] <%DXLelouch24> Shera will be a masochist and get off to it
[6:45:28] <%tigerfang86> NO PAT
[6:45:29] <%MoonObscure> PogChamp
[6:45:31] <b_ikki> BROCHETTE
[6:45:32] <joodatious> Zack will super be alive
[6:45:33] <Monkeyweed21> What if Cloud dies instead
[6:45:33] <%Valdorick> NO PAT THE TIDDIES
[6:45:33] <+PlagueOfGripes> they're just going to switch out Zack and Cloud when he's missing. since they have the same moveset and all
[6:45:33] <+TombstoneTTromboners> and then they make out
[6:45:34] <+aztecsaxwarrior> Cloud dies, replace with ZACH
[6:45:36] <zamzoph> @PatStaresAt But doesn't Cid's character arc specifically about his resentment towards his wife?
[6:45:38] <%rytyoung> Zack + Cloud vs. Sephiroth
[6:45:38] <%kaizerlith> Cid is verbally and psychologically abusive not physically though.
[6:45:39] <+megamanx74> mind blown.....damn
[6:45:41] <%UvBenServed> SEPHIROTH DIES TO SAVE AERITH
[6:45:43] <%boogaleeboo> Zack failed to beat Sephiroth and Cloud had to do it, Cloud earned his life
[6:45:43] <%Doctadaking> Where will the next game end, assuming the plot doesn’t completely change into new territory?
[6:45:45] <%ringabal> Zack fights Gackt who tries to kill Aerith
[6:45:46] <%Deimos002> Zack deserves to suffer for Crisis Core
[6:45:47] <%goldenchaos96> it will be a failing marriage but not an abusive one
[6:45:47] <%Alopekis> Then there's another fight
[6:45:49] <%Aracon_> GACKT
[6:45:49] <tusk102> ZACK
[6:45:49] <%Guardiansaiyan> @UvBenServed I HOPE

[6:46:09] <@SoFarFetched> Then they KISS
[6:46:09] <%ape_hawk> and then the threesome happens
[6:46:09] <Tha_Mik> And then they High five
[6:46:09] <%Guardiansaiyan> K I S S
[6:46:09] <dogekingjojo> That's the point of saving Aerith. Sephiroth manipulated events to make the crew want to save Aerith, because Aerith is the only one capable of using the lifestream to stop Meteor. The lifestream doesn't have a consciousness until SHE becomes a part of it. Sephiroth is sabotaging them.
[6:46:10] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Always use X-Cut

[6:46:14] <%KawaiiJetty> Zack comes out saying "HONOR"
[6:46:14] <KCFusecoast> Cid was a dick but at least he has reason for being a dick. OHHHH yeah that would be awesome LOLLLL
[6:46:14] <%snugglepuggs> but Cid and the lady weren't together they were roommates only. when the party mentions his girlfriend he gags and says not in a million years

[6:46:20] <+xBolts4Lifex> YEYEYEYEYEYEYEYE
[6:46:21] <%Wurmspawn> I'm guessing the next game will end at the Creator with Cloud giving the Black Materia to the Real Sephiroth. With the last game being the gang dealing with the consequences of that action as well as trying to get Cloud back from the abyss he went into after the hand off.
[6:46:21] <%Doctadaking> That’s just Sora and a Riku. Especially the kissing
