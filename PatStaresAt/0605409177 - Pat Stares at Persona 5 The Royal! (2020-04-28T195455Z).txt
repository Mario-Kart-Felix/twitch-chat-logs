Hey Pat, I notice sometimes you start muted and forget to turn on the equipment or unmute. At my old job I would put a sign on the mixer with a note, "Unmute, or Start Record" as a reminder. You put it on the mixer so you know before you start.
[0:08:03] <%Run44forrest> daph2Head
[0:08:03] <%heartlesshealer> Are you playing back the stream through your speakers???

[0:29:48] <%NickCaesar7> Tae Takemi is the best damn girl in P5, and the fact that you can date her as a high schooler is not only a blessing, it actively makes the game even better

[0:30:50] <+Tonku_the_Red> FF7R is still a blast to play even if you're spoiled on the ending.
[0:30:50] <Dhurkst> @optimasmaximas holy fuck dude, chill

[0:31:19] <%Big_Dream> ff7r is good though
[0:31:19] <@commanderclaw> Friendly reminder that the FF7 fandom has been toxic since the 90's
[0:31:19] <%Typhaeon> Redacted of Redacted
[0:31:20] <Scotaku> Now that's crazy talk.
[0:31:23] <%snow_bush> That's nuts
[0:31:25] <BallerSwagBro9k> ME3 ending was fixed by mods
[0:31:26] <BluBox> That's absurd and I didn't even care for the changes in that game
[0:31:28] <%ScreamLord> GaijinGoombah shits hard of FF7R and I think he's being unfair
[0:31:29] <%docpepperphd> that's a great comparison actually
[0:31:29] <+Merhabi> Litany of Bitching
[0:31:30] <%Ranryu692> that's so nuts
[0:31:30] <thatWaulfyguy> they are alike in that i dislike them
[0:31:31] <%GohanHitsugaya> Went afk, what is he on about?
[0:31:31] <%CanadianAnimatorGuy> Who could he be talking about???
[0:31:32] <%walternatorz> you could make that comparison if there weren't more games
[0:31:33] <seanbatz> I just replayed ME3 during quar so its fresh in mind after playing FVIIR and uhhh
[0:31:34] <%valriot> Plague is pretty absurd
[0:31:34] <%cvp5127> just play both
[0:31:35] <%j0ustar> I like the new add-ons, a little subtlety in the beginning would've been nice and that's about it
[0:31:41] <%CursedNobleman> IBS of dislikes LUL
[0:31:45] <%LandOfTheWay> FF7R seems pretty solid if you've played OG FF7 first
[0:31:47] <%logoth_> Eyepatch Wolf has issues too.
[0:31:50] <$zyberion626> People like to be angry
[0:31:50] <shin_marx> can't wait for a pc release filled with mods
[0:31:50] <+AbnormalVoid> it's like if they changed Mass Effect 1 to go in line with Mass Effect 3 🤔
[0:31:50] <%valriot> Plague only likes Dragonball and even then he HATES IT
[0:31:50] <%Legato_Ambrose> Friendly reminder that EVERY fandom has a toxic side, just some have a slightly 'larger' toxic side.
[0:31:50] <@commanderclaw> IBS is bullshit
[0:31:51] <%KaiserChillhelm> toxicity? in my video games?
[0:31:54] <%shadylawyerman> oh thank goodness we're still reading donos twitch has been Uber fucky as of late
[0:31:55] <%cureneckbeard> These names are sounding increasingly like Touhou titles
[0:31:59] <BallerSwagBro9k> @seanbatz Use the happy ending mod. Fixes the ending
[0:32:00] <%logoth_> or Monocle Coyote
[0:32:01] <%the38bandit> mass effect 3 was good game til the ending happened vs 1 ff7R game
[0:32:01] <PirateMike_> Mass effect 3 had an absolutly uncomparable dog shit ending
[0:32:01] <%docpepperphd> me3 is great except the ending. seems fair.
[0:32:02] <BluBox> He HATES it! :(
[0:32:06] <%ScreamLord> Yes!
[0:32:07] <%CanadianAnimatorGuy> Mass Effect 3 lol
[0:32:10] <%dekkitout> Chronic Joint Pain of Disgruntles do be like that
[0:32:17] <%heartlesshealer> eyeball!
[0:32:21] <%Dragon_Batman> Also, FF7 R is like a part of a greater story
[0:32:29] <go4thekneez> ehh in terms of out of left wing nonsense that's pretty close. luckily ff7r has more games after
[0:32:31] <%Big_Dream> the boy ghosts are not pleased
[0:32:33] <PirateMike_> Witcher 3 what?
[0:32:35] <%valriot> Covid of Whining
[0:32:40] <alphonseisbest> @PatStaresAt What if the FF7R games go the way of mass effect, would u retroactively dislike the first one?
[0:32:42] <%GohanHitsugaya> Make sure you mod witcher 3 so you can jump in shallow water...
[0:32:46] <%Birdigalore> What the hell is this light show

[1:15:58] <%topendbuzza> he auto up pat don't need a sun
[1:15:58] <nukle0nik> sun doesn't matter for the first day
[1:15:58] <$mrhappy6677> Sun persona not needed.
[1:15:58] <RogueMinja> He's auto advance.
[1:16:00] <%SvenHolgersson> Just like the real life Bernie Yoshida can't catch a break
[1:16:05] <+timeisconvolutedhere> he auto ranks
[1:16:07] <%heartlesshealer> to the blue room for goblins
[1:16:07] <$zyberion626> you don't need one at the start
[1:16:08] <Hazerto> Sunday and holidays
[1:16:11] <%ALazo> that doesn't sound right
[1:16:11] <nukle0nik> it matters for subsequent, but not for the first time
[1:16:12] <%cvp5127> neither does moon
[1:16:13] <$mrhappy6677> Same with moon.
[1:16:13] <$zyberion626> What? no.
[1:16:13] <%chill_o_wisp> his ALWAYS goes up
[1:16:14] <%starotter70> Always levels up
[1:16:15] <%logoth_> yes chat is right
[1:16:16] <Blackjack760> you have to unlock it first
[1:16:17] <Scotaku> You just unlock Sun at the beef bowl place.
[1:16:17] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> auto-erotic?
[1:16:18] <%Madbearv> One guy

[1:16:19] <%Corporate_Redeemer> yes
[1:16:20] <%pectusumbra> The Sun will rise, regardless of your wishes tiny man
[1:16:21] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> SUN, MOON, MAGICIAN, and FOOL
[1:16:21] <%BusterWoIf> Sun needs a persona, except for the first tier
[1:16:22] <@StridentSong> That's wrong. Moon uses one
[1:16:22] <%hawk_rush> look at the guide!
[1:16:23] <%topendbuzza> it is
[1:16:23] <%heartlesshealer> but pat goblins
[1:16:26] <nukle0nik> sun needs a persona, moon doesn't, but you don't need it for the first day
[1:16:27] <%VantomPayne> sun always level up yes
[1:16:27] <%Garthunox> it is
[1:16:31] <@StridentSong> Moon is bugged to not mention you have a moon persona
[1:16:32] <%Legato_Ambrose> I mean I always made sure I had Sun persona but
[1:16:32] <%starotter70> Sun needs no points
[1:16:34] <@StridentSong> But it uses it
[1:16:38] <%Lunaticbro > it is right. the points for sun are fake
[1:16:39] <%genowyn> Points don't matter for Sun
[1:16:40] <%heartlesshealer> =)
[1:16:40] <WanderingSwordsman> Sun always lvl up
[1:16:40] <$mrhappy6677> For sun and moon, you can choose whatever.
[1:16:40] <%Dragon_Batman> The first one doesn't need it but the rest should
[1:16:41] <%arancet> @PatStaresAt theres points, but they dont matter
[1:16:42] <%spiritofmojave> Sun does not need the points
[1:16:44] <%hawk_rush> @StridentSong oh, interesting to know
[1:16:47] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Don't you have a guide? Why are you listening to One Guy?
[1:16:47] <%ALazo> Just be safe pat
[1:16:48] <%GohanHitsugaya> Are you using the Samurai gamer guide?
[1:16:48] <%bread_assassin> It's right. The points don't matter.
[1:16:51] <%Garthunox> ok but you still don't need one
[1:16:52] <%spiritofmojave> Moon however legit does and is not a constant every sunday
[1:16:53] <+timeisconvolutedhere> spy said tho spyTea spyPraise
[1:16:53] <%starotter70> Yes
[1:16:54] <brizzlewa> Rank up regardless of points.
[1:16:56] <%Corporate_Redeemer> You don't get a boost so you need to get perfect answers
[1:17:00] <%heartlesshealer> Just get a sun if you're gonna regret
[1:17:00] <%linSP> I’m also using Samurai gamer guide

[2:01:41] <%s_xylocalsingles> JAPANESE BERNIE WOOOOO
[2:01:44] <+Merhabi> That's amazing for something so minor
[2:01:44] <%MadMatt2099> Three strikes!

[2:01:53] <$zyberion626> that was a real scandal btw
[2:01:58] <%j0ustar> Oops all embezzlement
[2:01:59] <%YakumoYomi> @hzealot Right? Are they pronouncing it wrong on purpose?
[2:02:00] <ultimate_joker_main> i like how the mistake is not doing it but being caught @PatStaresAt
[2:02:00] <%Corporate_Redeemer> @valdorick It's not a crime but more so a lack of being the bigger man. If you lose your shit over a dumb chick voter then how would you even react to another world leader being scummy or a terrorist threat?
[2:02:04] <%the38bandit> But he didnt
[2:02:05] <%CommanderSqueaks> Trump?
[2:02:06] <%Quigsies> Joe Biden?

[2:02:15] <Crimpson> Sounds like a system we need in the US
[2:02:16] <%Grayhammatter> LUL
[2:02:18] <mattdel92> Biden
[2:02:18] <%Ultimatefool> Oh no how dare someone be an idiot
[2:02:18] <%Typhaeon> Like that would prevent anyone from getting roasted
[2:02:20] <+bear_breaker20> this games writing iss eh
[2:02:23] <%Typhaeon> elected*
[2:02:26] <%hzealot> No Good Tora shuold come to america he'd be president here
[2:02:26] <%Lunaticbro > but were they being an idiot?
[2:02:27] <+Merhabi> Imagine a City Councilman getting that cool of a nick name
[2:02:29] <%lotharrio> I mean, maybe that guy WAS an idiot.
[2:02:29] <%Aeoneth> you can choose to do a mistake
[2:02:30] <%Razputin217> Oh is that all?
[2:02:31] <+Remery_> Calling someone a idiot that bad in Japan?
[2:02:33] <%CalderGaming> @logoth_ "Diet" is a term for a political assembly that Japan probably got from Germany who inherited it from the Holy Roman Empire
[2:02:33] <%Spec7re> WHAT IS THE DIET
[2:02:34] <Aoworth> This seems a little lost in translation. You can call voters idiots a lot here.
[2:02:35] <pakuman> YOU!
[2:02:37] <%MonsterEnvy> You can chose to make a mistake
[2:02:38] <Crimpson> He did
[2:02:40] <missingangle> But we all need to know, was that voter truly an idiot?
[2:02:40] <%segonian> that's a mistake Pat
[2:02:42] <+Press_X_ToJASON> ... mistakes are choices you make...
[2:02:42] <%CanadianAnimatorGuy> DIETO
[2:02:43] <%HotBloodedHero> Aren't mistakes just bad decisions tho?
[2:02:44] <%Jickiechan> the embezzlement is the biggest woah here
[2:02:45] <%valriot> Yeah but hes in denial about it being his own choice that he shouldnt be ashamed of
[2:02:45] <rookeealding> you could be president in the US with that reputation.
[2:02:46] <%topendbuzza> only lie to you pat
[2:02:47] <%Valdorick> "I too have commited 3 crimes"

[2:02:48] <bendatron> he didnt know what he was messin with
[2:02:49] <+akira_chong> @Spec7re Japanese Parliament
[2:02:50] <%Totally_not_toby> Pat doesn't know what mistake means
[2:02:50] <%GarbageNirvana> A phantom thief politician would be badass though
[2:02:51] <pakuman> Yoshida got fat once he got kicked out of the Diet
[2:02:52] <%Ultimatefool> Diet is like their Congress
[2:02:56] <%indig0bird> Also, didn't some dipshit closed the beaches so his family would go on vacation?

[2:03:09] <%KawaiiJetty> I don't care LUL
[2:03:09] <+Flambage> @PatStaresAt Are you sure you wanna learn from him? Maybe learn from someone who wasn't caught
[2:03:11] <$zyberion626> the Diet is Japan's federal legislature

[2:04:12] <%CanadianAnimatorGuy> "You're SOLDIER right? That means I own you."
[2:04:12] <%Legato_Ambrose> YOU HAD SOME CORRUPT POLITICAL HELP DIDNT YOU?!
[2:04:13] <%heartlesshealer> so I was wrong, this isn't the charm stuff, but his actual confidant
[2:04:15] <%chill_o_wisp> chugga chugga chugga chugga
[2:04:15] <NiktenKing> Speaking with confidence is why Crazy Talk exists
[2:04:15] <appletumtum> Oh yeah, he's in jail
[2:04:18] <alwayspronking> ENGLISH HOW DO YOU KNOW IT LUL
[2:04:18] <%ssjklyco> Who taught you how to talk
[2:04:20] <%Dragovus> Shady Deals aren't Crimes
[2:04:21] <Aoworth> It is, but other people can only notice speaking with confidence
[2:04:23] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> "You must have government connections"
[2:04:25] <%ssjklyco> Answer me prisoner
[2:04:26] <MSN04_Sazabi> HOW ARE YOU ABLE TO TALK?
[2:04:27] <%Zombrocom> Is it though?
[2:04:27] <%Spec7re> Thats oddly specific
[2:04:28] <%Grayhammatter> nope
[2:04:29] <%cisealnine> "You must've learned how to speak somewhere"
[2:04:29] <%topendbuzza> wha?
[2:04:29] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> RYUJI WRITES THE CARDS
[2:04:31] <%republicofu> most if not all the S.Links in this game are very superficial
[2:04:33] <Scotaku> That doesn't make sense.
[2:04:33] <missingangle> uh huh sure
[2:04:34] <%XeroSigmaPrime> I only have a job cuz I faked it... and I sucked some dicks
[2:04:36] <%reonome> HOW DID YOU SPEAK GOOD
[2:04:36] <bigstupidjellyfish1337> hello sexy sister
[2:04:43] <Mattais88> But you just accused the Artist of that
[2:04:46] <%Grayhammatter> it's so bad LUL
[2:04:46] <%Zombrocom> Sae, you are so bizarre

[2:04:47] <%Razputin217> Who teach you talk good? Answer!
[2:04:47] <mattdel92> Real waifu
[2:04:50] <%TheMattman1313> "A student couldn't possibly do this" RYUJI CAME UP WITH THE IDEA
[2:04:50] <%hawk_rush> he has a cut-off date tho, right?
[2:04:51] <%ssjklyco> Also, Ryuji writes them.
[2:04:52] <%chill_o_wisp> no you cant
[2:04:53] <%JohnAtDawn> Not EVERY one. Just almost.
[2:04:54] <%CappuccinoGuil> how, HOW DID YOU LEARN TO SPEAK GOODLY???
[2:04:55] <%YakumoYomi> No...? I never even got him in my playthrough.
[2:04:55] <%Daniel_Is_I> He has a cut-off date
[2:04:56] <%topendbuzza> yep
[2:04:58] <%starotter70> WHERE DID YOU LEARN HOW TO WRITE?
[2:05:01] <%CalderGaming> you can jsutify that much more easily with a TEACHER Sae. at his SCHOOL
[2:05:02] <Yukai_Yami> JOKER NEVER DID A CALLING CARD
[2:05:02] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Kids can't write good. It's a fact. Must have been an adult.
[2:05:02] <Scotaku> Fucking Ryuji writes them.
[2:05:04] <%reinbachthe3rd> @reonome SPEAK TOO GOOD, HOW?
[2:05:04] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> :)
[2:05:04] <%PsideFxX> they don't know that
[2:05:05] <Aoworth> If you splice together all those accusations, Sai looks like the dumbest fucking interrogator
[2:05:06] <%Ultimatefool> No young person talks to politicians, this is ALL LIES
[2:05:06] <+Merhabi> WHO TAUGHT YOU TO READ
[2:05:07] <%VantomPayne> "you must have political connection" is better
[2:05:10] <coldfire0007> I couldnt max him
[2:05:11] <%pectusumbra> You could see it as she's insuating there is a power behind the PT
[2:05:11] <%Sheen_ultralord> she doesnt know that for she though
[2:05:12] <+Press_X_ToJASON> but he's prompted early and he has like 0 requirements
[2:05:15] <%Big_Dream> yes
[2:05:16] <M4T1A5> I never even knew he existed
[2:05:16] <%Daniel_Is_I> His confidant cuts off some time in november iirc
[2:05:17] <%chill_o_wisp> he locks off before sae's papace
[2:05:18] <+Merhabi> YOUR ASS SURE IS CLEAN, WHO WIPED IT

[2:16:05] <%cisealnine> What about Persona 2?
[2:16:06] <@SoFarFetched> Everytime I hear Yusuke talk I keep thinking he pulls a red rose out,sniffs it while contemplating with the world on why hes so beautiful while his group is so uggo LUL
[2:16:08] <alphonseisbest> @akira_chong were u here for the first palace?
[2:16:08] <%starotter70> Slightly different scale Morgana
[2:16:09] <%spiritofmojave> a world where Kamoshitta raps and rapes in PQ2 [shudders]
[2:16:12] <%heartlesshealer> like the 13th hour
[2:16:12] <Mattais88> It says something when your smartest party member is a horny amnesiac cat.
[2:16:13] <%Daniel_Is_I> Yusuke asks big questions but is otherwise a moron.
[2:16:13] <kazumakiryu12> In SMT there are dozen worlds all destroyed by YNVH
[2:16:15] <bendatron> like a tv or a hole hidden hour
[2:16:17] <%Robot_Nixon_> jokers smart, he's just a troll if you choose the right choices :)
[2:16:19] <aretos1> fuck this is so much better than the other hideouts
[2:16:19] <%SGrim> @PatStaresAt they all talk only one at a time because they need to take turns using the brain they all share. tpanimeYGOpotofgreed
[2:16:22] <%ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt No one must know that the founding members of the Phantoms Thieves were morons bumbling fucking their way through their first cases by sheer blind luck
[2:16:25] <+akira_chong> @alphonseisbest no what happened
[2:16:26] <%42nfl19> Yeah @PatStaresAt , what's it like to live in another world called CANADA
[2:16:27] <%RAAAAAINMAKER> How is this an improvement from Karate & Steak waifu and Not Funny inn keeper?
[2:16:28] <%pectusumbra> @SoFarFetched Yusuke is way more of a weirdo than that
[2:16:32] <Dhurkst> @akira_chong It's a combination of stylistic sensibilities, and characters having aspects that appeal to people
[2:16:34] <%mister___doctor> "I'll bet you theres some weird TV world too. Nah, that'd be stupid."
[2:16:35] <%Strider222> FOR REAL
[2:16:42] <%CanadianAnimatorGuy> That last one was GREAT
[2:16:46] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> it WAS
[2:16:46] <%heartlesshealer> yeah
[2:16:47] <%Dragon_Batman> It was decent
[2:16:50] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> The first card was FANTASTIC
[2:16:51] <%topendbuzza> time for better art tho
[2:16:52] <$zyberion626> Ryuji's was fine!
[2:16:56] <Aoworth> Ryuji did a good job aside from weird grammar
[2:17:01] <+Merhabi> He did his BEST
[2:17:03] <%CalderGaming> "commissions are 5000 yen an hour"
[2:17:06] <%valriot> "He needs to know its from a dumbass"
[2:17:07] <KnightAsteran> Ryujis was more cartoony
[2:17:10] <%Aydarkzero> Ryuji is now card man
[2:17:12] <%Daniel_Is_I> Ryuji tried way too hard
[2:17:14] <%Spec7re> Ryuji is a good boy with good words
[2:17:14] <%Jickiechan> I prefer Ryujis logo the best
[2:17:15] <MSN04_Sazabi> Yusuke is working for exposure
[2:17:16] <+Merhabi> He read a thesaurus and everything
[2:17:16] <mattdel92> See! Yusuke is SMRT
[2:17:17] <%Zombrocom> Ryuji made the logo
[2:17:20] <%Joestar1890> Pretty good for Ryuji standards at least, considering he has the worst grades of the group, maybe he's just lazy?
[2:17:25] <%KawaiiJetty> Ryuji is a pure dude
[2:17:25] <%CappuccinoGuil> Persona 5 says "PUT SOME FUCKING POLISH IN YOUR WORK"
[2:17:29] <%spiritofmojave> Ryuji deserves the credit for the logo
[2:17:34] <%heartlesshealer> LUL
[2:17:35] <%spiritofmojave> He prototyped it
[2:17:35] <NiktenKing> LUL

[2:32:25] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> The sign says Keep Out which is too powerful in the Cognitive World
[2:32:26] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> It is a weird esoteric non-real area, so signs might actually have real power.

[2:47:13] <%cumurasame> On Merciless this fight is bullshit because your team just get Weakness abused
[2:47:14] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> cool name
[2:47:18] <%kyh9> No, that's the sin beast he represents, it's not his actual name
[2:47:21] <%Typhaeon> All of them have demonic middle names
[2:47:22] <%j0ustar> Super Sentai Artist Squad
[2:47:23] <KnightAsteran> in base P5 you just redid the painting phase multiple times, but also threw paint on him
[2:47:23] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> Oho, is this why the one guy wanted featherman outfits?
[2:47:23] <Scotaku> All the bosses have middle names that are just names for satan.
[2:47:26] <%Zombrocom> Like how Kamoshida was Asmodeus
[2:47:27] <%Typhaeon> Kamoshida was a different one
[2:47:28] <TheReaperofGrim> So Pats fighting the power rangers now?
[2:47:28] <%maenos2> Pat, no...
[2:47:29] <%pectusumbra> that's just add-ons to all the shadow bosses.
[2:47:30] <%Aydarkzero> man this season of Super Sentai kind of sucks
[2:47:34] <Vellarus> oh no, its joltorame and flarearame, and glaceame and breezerame
[2:47:35] <%Dragon_Batman> I imagine opposites work
[2:47:36] <%HotBloodedHero> They're all called Ersatz too
[2:47:38] <%Joestar1890> Every Shadow boss has a middle name related to their sin. Shadow Kamoshida had Asmodeus in his name
[2:47:41] <%Th3SmartAlec> OOF
[2:47:41] <%hawk_rush> use baton pass yooo
[2:47:43] <%bread_assassin> Azazel isn't his middle name. It's the demon of greed.

[2:49:47] <Sgt_Wigglytuff> Baton pass is soo much better this time around
[2:49:49] <%linSP> quad baton pass on this fight was the BEST

[2:50:06] <zenith0111> Normal is piss baby easy
[2:50:09] <%ScreamLord> CHINK!?
[2:50:10] <%crovvv> Pat overlevels so he doesn't have to figure out the stupid boss fight "puzzles" lol
[2:50:12] <Slimeking_Mike> @aretos1 judging by AGermanSpy’s stream, not overpowered enough
[2:50:13] <%Th3SmartAlec> So I started blasting

[2:50:22] <aretos1> oh gotcha
[2:50:22] <awildgooseappears> hey its a heavy baton pass relying fight
[2:50:24] <%espanishcanamurciana> look at that blonde *gaijin* with her glock
[2:50:27] <%Grayhammatter> did you though?
[2:50:28] <+akira_chong> What I'm the most interested in is how they actually resolve his character after the end here. This game seems to have a really bad track record with forgiving the unforgivable.
[2:50:28] <Dhurkst> @akira_chong Claiming there's no such thing as objective value is abject nonsense. Just look at things ling food, water, and shelter. Also, standards of quality are determined by culture & tradition, so they're extremely subjective.

[2:50:52] <%Dragon_Batman> Good call I say
[2:50:56] <%bread_assassin> Y'all thought Pat overlevels, but German Spy blows Pat outta the water when it comes to grinding.
[2:50:56] <%Grayhammatter> yes, why don't?
[2:50:57] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> woooo
[2:50:57] <%Spec7re> @akira_chong Japan seems to like that trope in its media

[2:51:11] <awildgooseappears> yeyey
[2:51:13] <zenith0111> @akira_chong What? Who have they forgiven?
[2:51:20] <%cumurasame> @akira_chong Yeah Villains aren't great in this game in particular, though this is actually the one with the most, but it's locked behind Yusuke's confidant
[2:51:21] <%Th3SmartAlec> nice
[2:51:24] <KnightAsteran> @aretos1 I'm playing through in Hard and it's a decent challenge, except for one boss fight that's so annoying I turned it to normal
[2:51:25] <%Grayhammatter> nice
[2:51:26] <%worldbrand> pog
[2:51:27] <%kyh9> @akira_chong It's not even that as much as, surprisingly, it doesn't explore the psyche of the re-habilitation of the villains

[2:51:42] <%Aydarkzero> Old Man is out of Clones LUL
[2:51:44] <+Ya_Boi_AD> I mean, the villains don't really DESERVE to be forgiven for the most part
[2:51:49] <aretos1> @KnightAsteran i played basegame royal seems more challenging
[2:51:51] <+akira_chong> @Dhurkst Those don't have objective value, just universal subjective value. There's literally a difference.

[3:24:01] <%thelaxinator> thelaxinator subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months, currently on a 11 month streak! The reason why they mention "Herlock Sholmes" is because the name Goro Akechi is a play on the japanese boy detective character Kogoro Akechi. Bonus points: the word Kokoro means heart and the game focuses on taking hearts.
[3:24:03] <ECRead> @Kamennoo yeah it was fucked

[3:26:35] <+rei0> you're doing real well on confidants
[3:26:37] <%arancet> yeah but best to beat stat walls before you hit them if you can anticipate
[3:26:37] <sling1995> You’re doing great
[3:26:38] <awildgooseappears> Just balnce them out
[3:26:38] <%CalderGaming> IF ONLY YOU HAD THAT IN REAL LIFE AMIRITE
[3:26:41] <%Zombrocom> Close enough
[3:26:43] <@StridentSong> Same with Faith and Justice later
[3:26:46] <%Strider222> who cares about Ann
[3:26:47] <%Zebroneath> Following a day-by-day guide is dumb, don't do it.
[3:26:48] <%optimasmaximas> takemi Kreygasm
[3:26:51] <%starotter70> It's early in the game so kinda hard to tell
[3:26:52] <%StrifeZubia> Oh son of a bitch, you can zoom into the map and see WHICH characters you can talk to? TIL
[3:26:52] <%doc_ock_rokc> @CalderGaming Yeah tell me about it

[3:26:59] <%indig0bird> Hot goth tho
[3:26:59] <%Rakenshin> Takemi for accessories
[3:27:02] <%topendbuzza> yes
[3:27:02] <Scotaku> In my run I'm just ignoring Tower and Hanged Man so I have wiggle room.
[3:27:06] <Mattais88> get those SP bagdes from doc death.
[3:27:08] <$zyberion626> you said Ann will be in your main party right? Might as well juice her up @PatStaresAt
[3:27:10] <SirDogBear> you doing good, once you get fortune then its gonna be a steamroll
[3:27:12] <%BubbaRands> LEGGS OR FLATT
[3:27:18] <%burgerdicks> What level is Takemi at?
[3:27:20] <Crimpson> @PatStaresAt I did the same in P5, but I think if they don't say you can level it up yet, you can still hang out with them and increase the chance the next time you hang out to rank them up
[3:27:23] <%topendbuzza> he does not need them he has dlc
[3:27:24] <%rumtumtugnutz> Lick Ann's butthole
[3:27:26] <%CalderGaming> @doc_ock_rokc it would have to be written by someone who had already played you, so Looper
[3:27:29] <%ssjklyco> If you can't up a social link, up your social stats. Also, I think Ryuji's might be locked for a few days until he contacts you with an update.
[3:27:31] <awildgooseappears> oh no
[3:27:31] <%Scarnehu> Ann
[3:27:37] <%pectusumbra> probably more once next target appears

[3:28:05] <$zyberion626> Yusuke
[3:28:05] <%spiritofmojave> Ann!
[3:28:05] <Warfey> Yusuke
[3:28:06] <%aishman> @PatStaresAt Ryuji?
[3:28:07] <%aslfrasle> Ann
[3:28:09] <Vellarus> yusuke

[3:28:10] <%CommanderSqueaks> Ann
[3:28:10] <@StridentSong> Bye Ann
[3:28:12] <bendatron> ryuji
[3:28:12] <Dest_121> yusuke is trash
[3:28:13] <RogueMinja> Ann, probably.
[3:28:13] <%arancet> why a set party? just switch around for mana and hp
[3:28:14] <%mechslayer71> ALL VAGINAS
[3:28:17] <%valriot> @PatStaresAt You say that but youre not gonna want Haru over Ryuji, youll know why
[3:28:17] <%MonsterEnvy> Using whoever is most useful
[3:28:18] <%PanicSwytch> Ann
[3:28:18] <%ssjklyco> I rocked Jokers Angels the whole game.
[3:28:21] <%optimasmaximas> yusuke
[3:28:22] <%cvp5127> @PatStaresAt swap out the oldest
[3:28:22] <%hoopray> Yusuke, Ann is best magic user
[3:28:24] <%TenderBabyBacon> Out Ryuji
[3:28:24] <%pectusumbra> personally I dumped Yusuke, probably him or ryujin since they are phys boys
[3:28:24] <Geboss5361> Yusuke
[3:28:26] <%spiritofmojave> Keep Ryuji he's too good
[3:28:27] <%Zombrocom> I wish XP was shared so you can just rotate freely
[3:28:27] <bendatron> anns magic i find too valuable
[3:28:27] <Vellarus> joker must always have a harem
[3:28:28] <%MakotoPB> bye Felicia
[3:28:30] <%Meekest> Just dump Yusuke again
[3:28:33] <%Daniel_Is_I> Haru's GREAT
[3:28:33] <%not_twitter_rowan> she is
[3:28:33] <%starotter70> She is
[3:28:34] <sling1995> Ryuji
[3:28:35] <%MonsterEnvy> She is great
[3:28:35] <%Daniel_Is_I> Guns for days
[3:28:35] <%spiritofmojave> She is
[3:28:35] <+Ya_Boi_AD> Ryuji has a ton of good shit
[3:28:35] <%pectusumbra> Haru's great, people hate
[3:28:36] <Dest_121> ann is better than yusuke
[3:28:37] <awildgooseappears> HARU IS SUPER GOOD
[3:28:37] <brizzlewa> Haru is amazing with gun kit.
[3:28:38] <waifoong98> Minmax your Persona and dump everyone Kappa
[3:28:38] <ECRead> Haru's great
[3:28:39] <%Garthunox> she is
[3:28:39] <%Quigsies> She's good
[3:28:41] <$zyberion626> Ryuji has a lot of S-link power, so dump Yusuke @PatStaresAt
[3:28:42] <%Townspoon> Put morgana back in so you can take him out again
[3:28:44] <%Rakenshin> Ryuji has attack up for the entire party
[3:28:44] <Dest_121> haru is good
[3:28:44] <@StridentSong> Ryuji gets Charge and God's Hand which does insane amounts of damage late game
[3:28:45] <bendatron> she gets heat riser doesnt she
[3:28:45] <SirDogBear> ann got sleep and that random charm chance too later
[3:28:45] <%pectusumbra> Haru has guns and psy, plus heat riser
[3:28:47] <%ergulor> Go for Poochie
[3:28:47] <Gameaholic42> Don't lock yourself into any plans. This game has some surprises
[3:28:47] <%hoopray> Haru's last ability is BROKEN
[3:28:48] <%ssjklyco> She is good for status heals
[3:28:49] <%CommanderSqueaks> Solo run
[3:28:49] <%topendbuzza> I use everyone endgame and swap em around mid fight
[3:28:49] <%not_twitter_rowan> she totally is - one guy
[3:28:51] <%spiritofmojave> Haru has the power of GUN
[3:28:51] <zenith0111> RYUJI IS BIG BOY
[3:28:52] <%MonsterEnvy> You don't need to think about this right now
[3:28:52] <+Ya_Boi_AD> Both Haru and Ryuji are good physical hitters
[3:28:53] <brizzlewa> Ann is fantastic at end game.
[3:28:54] <+hitmanforyou> Haru is fantastic
[3:28:55] <%Zebroneath> Haru has Tetrakarn and Makarakarn, right?
[3:28:56] <%Scarnehu> ann
[3:28:56] <%ssjklyco> Ann gets a super fire attack
[3:28:57] <Kuj999> She is
[3:28:58] <%arancet> ann best magic user
[3:28:59] <+rei0> ryuji is not great for going thru dungeon
[3:28:59] <%starotter70> Ann is a powerful black mage at end game
[3:29:00] <%bevyrage> haru is big damage but she isn't well rounded
[3:29:00] <awildgooseappears> Better damage potential with magic in Ann
[3:29:00] <%valriot> @PatStaresAt Ryuji gets an 80% phys damage up trait, for everyone
[3:29:01] <%dirtyh4rr1> psa1guy
[3:29:01] <%LandOfTheWay> they're all viable
[3:29:03] <%aishman> @PatStaresAt Just get Star to 10 and have EVERYONE FOREVER AT ALL TIME
[3:29:03] <+bear_breaker20> p sure Haru's penios is bigger than Ryuji's soooooooo
[3:29:04] <%JD_Lars> Dump Ryuji
[3:29:05] <+Ya_Boi_AD> Literally ANYONE can be in your party
[3:29:05] <Crimpson> Ryuji is suppose to be good for most of the game. Haru is mostly good only at end game due to having Pys attacks
[3:29:06] <brizzlewa> You can ignore Ann for now, but you'll want her later.
[3:29:06] <+rei0> only for bosses, and even then he's not great
[3:29:07] <%MonsterEnvy> Also should you not just swap around as is most useful
[3:29:15] <%TheActuallyGuy> dump ann. women don't work well together.
[3:29:18] <%cvp5127> just level all of them
[3:29:20] <%GoopyEuclid> How much exp did you put into Yusuke?
[3:29:21] <awildgooseappears> and ryuji
[3:29:22] <SirDogBear> you can make anyone good with the will seed items too
[3:29:23] <%ssjklyco> Also, Ann's skill can cut SP cost
[3:29:25] <sling1995> Ryuji is the bomb my guy
[3:29:27] <Crimpson> I would dump Ann if you are using your character as the healer
[3:29:32] <%optimasmaximas> @PatStaresAt what about that other new party member?
[3:29:38] <@StridentSong> I went Joker, Makoto, Yusuke and New Girl this time around. Works out really well
[3:29:38] <%RAAAAAINMAKER> Just party grind mementos late game and decide later
[3:29:39] <%miguelrod777> I had Ann yusuke Makati the entire game
[3:29:40] <%topendbuzza> the sp cut she has now is great
[3:29:46] <Dest_121> yusuke is a garbage character in battle
[3:29:50] <%valriot> The best team is Ryuji, Makoto and new girl (when she shows up)
[3:29:50] <$zyberion626> Yusuke is subpar
[3:29:51] <%cumurasame> @PatStaresAt You can use anyone, you can customise the party to an incredible extent and the Will Seed Wings are broken. Don't worry too much. Though I will say Makoto's final ability is bullshit.
[3:29:56] <sejin_centrife> @Crimpson ann isn't a healer
[3:29:57] <BurdRightsActivist> All the characters are garbage :)
[3:30:02] <Yukai_Yami> Just juggle em with Star’s ability
[3:30:02] <$zyberion626> he's behind on the exp anywho
[3:30:06] <+albedo455> kick mona out
[3:30:08] <waifoong98> 1 man army Kappa
[3:30:09] <@StridentSong> And Ryuji was in New Girl's spot until she joined
[3:30:10] <Dest_121> i used ryuji haru and makoto almost the whole game
[3:30:12] <%valriot> @PatStaresAt Haru is good, but soon as new girl shows up, she just isnt needed
[3:30:13] <%Iccirrus> Use who ya want until Kasumi joins, then use whoever you want and her
[3:30:14] <%televisedrevolting> Pat go into Thieves Den and play 300 games of Cutthroat Tycoon.
[3:30:15] <awildgooseappears> Yusuke has the batton pass move WHICH IS BUSTED though
[3:30:16] <%topendbuzza> rude
[3:30:17] <Crimpson> @sejin_centrife She obtains healing stuff at the start.
[3:30:17] <MSN04_Sazabi> Morgana tho
[3:30:17] <+Ya_Boi_AD> How dare-
[3:30:19] <Retinolgaming> D:
[3:30:19] <%hoopray> Haru is waaay worse
[3:30:22] <RogueMinja> Yusuke's pretty good.
[3:30:23] <%trustycoyote> Same. Can't stand Yusuke
[3:30:23] <%aishman> Yusuke "Rent is a masterpiece" Last name @PatStaresAt
[3:30:24] <%Quigsies> Morgana exists
[3:30:26] <Dest_121> yusuke has nothing that seperates him from the others
[3:30:27] <Merkensteiner> RUDE
[3:30:29] <+Ya_Boi_AD> When Morgana exists, how can Yusuke be the worst
[3:30:31] <%televisedrevolting> Also you're incorrect, Patrick.
[3:30:31] <%Taglog7> BibleThump BRO
[3:30:32] <BurdRightsActivist> Morgana more like uh, Bad
[3:30:33] <%Grayhammatter> time to cuck the cat
[3:30:33] <arkv01> I am dying from all this haru and yusuke hate
[3:30:34] <bendatron> really even with harus underdevelopeed ass
[3:30:36] <%maenos2> Shit taste
[3:30:37] <BurdRightsActivist> Morgana more like shitty Gouto
[3:30:41] <el_patronn64> You say that now
[3:30:41] <zenith0111> Cuck the cat PogChamp
[3:30:43] <@StridentSong> Yusuke get's the Group Heat Riser
[3:30:44] <+Ya_Boi_AD> Haru is actually top tier
[3:30:45] <Crimpson> @sejin_centrife Your character and Morgana are really your primary healers. Ann is kind of like a back up
[3:30:45] <+Pixel_Matt> Haru is introduced waaaaay too late
[3:30:49] <%valriot> Ryuji and new girl FUCK SHIT UP, cos its phys attack monsters
[3:30:50] <sejin_centrife> @Crimpson she does, but it's garbage and her real purpose is magic. her damage is insane
[3:30:51] <%Grayhammatter> the mall
[3:30:55] <%topendbuzza> mall
[3:30:57] <alphonseisbest> @PatStaresAt How can u put him lower than the fuckin cat?1
[3:31:03] <%NoHoldsBarredProductions> @grayhammatter What a sentence 🤣
[3:31:04] <awildgooseappears> i just feel bad for morgana when joker´s already with Ann
[3:31:05] <ShichiNoBushi> Mall.
[3:31:06] <alphonseisbest> THE SIMP CAT PAT
[3:31:06] <%cumurasame> @PatStaresAt If we're talking about BIG NUMBER DPS, the best team though I'm pretty sure is DA BOIS
[3:31:08] <%televisedrevolting> Oh fuck I forgot, Yusuke's new final is fucking absurd.
[3:31:09] <sling1995> My less favorite is Mona
[3:31:11] <arkv01> yusuke AINT NO SIMP
[3:31:13] <@StridentSong> Yup
[3:31:17] <RogueMinja> Yusuke's team Heat Riser is amazing.
[3:31:18] <brizzlewa> Physical is bad due to lack of Amp.
[3:31:19] <%televisedrevolting> So is Makotos.
[3:31:26] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> hei batch
[3:31:28] <%MakotoPB> I always wonder why I see more Makoto named girls in games. it's unisex name :/
[3:31:35] <%CommanderSqueaks> How do I talk to WOMAN?
[3:31:35] <%topendbuzza> simp
[3:31:39] <@StridentSong> Makoto gets the group Deabilitate
[3:31:40] <BurdRightsActivist> morgana is fucking COOMING right now
[3:31:40] <%Grayhammatter> da pretty lady
[3:31:44] <%Zebroneath> Just give her a lot of sweets.
[3:31:46] <%valriot> The final moves are pretty bad cos they cost so much SP, but the traits are for real. Ryuji giving party wide phys is the most broken shit
[3:31:46] <Dest_121> honestly haru's final skill is amazing in certain fights
[3:31:49] <brizzlewa> You'll want Haru and Makoto for technicals.
[3:31:49] <bendatron> Haru would have been fine if they acknowledged her more than twice after her dungeon
[3:31:52] <awildgooseappears> @brizzlewa crit chance balances them out though
[3:31:53] <SirDogBear> later on you can give characters certain skills with one of the new buildings too like charge for yusuke
[3:31:54] <333agus333> CUCK THE CAT
[3:31:55] <%miguelrod777> haru ultimate skill is strong too

[3:32:06] <Warfey> wait what??
[3:32:11] <Dest_121> haru gets group makarakarn and tetrakarn as well
[3:32:11] <%Garthunox> yusuke gets group heat riser
[3:32:12] <%doc_ock_rokc> @sling1995 another hour or so
[3:32:16] <+rei0> why are u guys spoiling stuff
[3:32:16] <Crimpson> @sejin_centrife I honestly don't remember who I had at end game. I think it was Makoto, Haru, and Ryuji
[3:32:18] <%Taglog7> I wanna fuck Anne's barely existent brains out.
[3:32:19] <%bread_assassin> All final skills are pretty great.
[3:32:19] <%CommanderSqueaks> Quiet simpana
[3:32:21] <%televisedrevolting> God that final boss is great, because of how good it feels to curbstomp.
[3:32:23] <%valriot> @PatStaresAt Ryujis final trait is chance at 80% phys attack up, for any party member

[3:38:48] <%cumurasame> Ann's parents are actually Japanese with American descent. Ann states she's 1/4 Japanese, which is FUCKING IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE SHE HAS BLONDE HAIR.
[3:38:53] <%CopperTucker> CopperTucker subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months! Oh hey, didn't realize it was stream baby time. Here's to many more, to you, Paige, and the best Elmo.

[4:08:09] <%SilverDevilfish> Given the level of mental illness in Japan... yeah
[4:08:09] <satans_finest_millennial> Psychologist and psychotherapist are different things legally speaking
[4:08:13] <%doc_ock_rokc> Is it weird I don't hate ether way. I mean it would depend on the circumstances
[4:08:17] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> It super isn't
[4:08:17] <+withguac> “Eastern” is pretty vague
[4:08:18] <+Tredecian> "let try and make you a batter cog"
[4:08:20] <%cumurasame> @PatStaresAt Oh man, I can't wait until you get deeper into this confidant
[4:08:21] <%Typhaeon> Too much psychology is about changing the person to fit the situation

[4:08:32] <%beepbeepbopbop> Confirmist BS.
[4:08:33] <MooseoneLivedhere> japan is a awufly place to live IRL
[4:08:33] <%MakotoPB> Japan doesn't understand mental illnesses still to this day
[4:08:34] <%ScreamLord> That story about that one guy's job basically harassing him for not working over time still pisses me off
[4:08:36] <%VashyronM> Duty is more important than personal fulfillment
[4:08:36] <+bear_breaker20> profs DansGame
[4:08:44] <%cvp5127> dont go against the flow

[4:08:55] <%doc_ock_rokc> @VashyronM Some people respond very positively to Duty
[4:08:58] <%ScreamLord> Don't rock the boat

[4:09:13] <%Zombrocom> Stop calling my cellphone teacher!
[4:09:22] <%bread_assassin> So is Eastern closer to a growth mindset, and Western closer to a fixed mindset, then?
[4:09:22] <%reonome> MORE SNACKS
[4:09:24] <%MonsterEnvy> You are not doing actual psychology with him right now.
[4:09:24] <%BubbaRands> 2 HAPPY POPS
[4:09:25] <%VashyronM> @doc_ock_rokc Sure, some people do.
[4:09:26] <%RAAAAAINMAKER> Hey bitch, You Sad Yet?
[4:09:28] <%YakumoYomi> @doc_ock_rokc Not really. The issue is that Japan seems to be a heavily conformist society, so the approach to mental health there seems geared toward not disrupting the status quo
[4:09:28] <MooseoneLivedhere> no joke this is really creep
[4:09:29] <%weissguard> Some of those have effects.
[4:09:37] <%CommanderSqueaks> Did he just run into Peach?
[4:09:39] <arkv01> no money no honey
[4:09:40] <+withguac> I am “eastern” and have never seen that type of psychology portrayed as healthy; not that nobody thinks this but that’s true in any place
[4:09:41] <%logoth_> Maruki is getting robbed
[4:09:42] <%CappuccinoGuil> Here, have my wallet!
[4:09:42] <%cumurasame> Guys, would you go to your doctors/therapists more if they had the BEST snacks ever to feed you?
[4:09:44] <%Zombrocom> Did he just get scammed?
[4:09:48] <Dest_121> maruki just got sammed
[4:09:50] <%pectusumbra> yeyeyeyeyeye

[4:09:52] <%cylish> Why do I feel like that tourist will never be seen again?
[4:09:54] <%Grayhammatter> ye
[4:09:57] <+withguac> Also there’s a lot of bias in medicine so hey. I mean Henrietta lacks anyone?
[4:09:58] <%starotter70> RANK 7 eyyy
[4:10:01] <%pectusumbra> awwww, but Ryuji 7. That's a good stop
[4:10:01] <WeltSchulter> bet hes faking it
[4:10:05] <%TheActuallyGuy> guy in a long coat and sandals that clearly is not a psychiatrist offering candy to children... Seems Legit.
[4:10:06] <%RAAAAAINMAKER> Joker is literally surrounded by horny idiots
[4:10:07] <+CrescentRubyRose> That part appears infrequently, Pat
[4:10:08] <arkv01> ryuji is the guy who calls the nigerian friend his 'friend'
[4:10:11] <%pectusumbra> then you can get huge off screen
[4:10:12] <%doc_ock_rokc> @YakumoYomi I'd agrue trying to just cut out everything in your life that makes you sad also has detrimental effects on a person

[4:13:32] <%YakumoYomi> @doc_ock_rokc That sounds really reasonable.
[4:13:35] <%thelaxinator> coffee is basically anti-water
[4:13:54] <%luketrapwalker> But coffee is made with water tho
[4:13:54] <blue6sub6remnant6> ***
[4:13:55] <%Robot_Nixon_> Or a water speedrun through your body
[4:14:13] <%thelaxinator> coffee actively ejects liquids (and solids) from your body
[4:14:32] <%spiritofmojave> Coffee is a water propeller
[4:14:38] <%PlainSimpleTailor> @withguac races are neither superior nor inferior. Cultures and traditions are though
[4:15:03] <%thelaxinator> don't listen to him, cardassian propaganda
[4:15:04] <%optimasmaximas> @Robot_Nixon_ so coffee is a speed run tactic to get water through your system? send an email to the podcast LUL
[4:15:21] <%Divryne> Divryne subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 21 months, currently on a 21 month streak! Yo Pat just finished P5R a few minutes ago.

[4:15:58] <%Robot_Nixon_> @optimasmaximas plumbers hate this one trick no one tells you about!
[4:16:08] <%doc_ock_rokc> @YakumoYomi Yeah, but some people don't like it. Because its not quick, easy, nor does it result in "Absolute" happiness. Staying to face a problem for some is too much and others are to prideful to back off. and because you have to customize the treatments people can't directly compare to others which can hinder some progress.
[4:16:15] <@SoFarFetched> Plumbers don't wear ties
[4:16:32] <%optimasmaximas> @Robot_Nixon_ LUL that should be the subject of the email

[4:29:23] <%CommanderSqueaks> @jack_of_no_trades The right answer.
[4:29:35] <%spiritofmojave> I'd give Pillars or New Vegas that honor but I'm biased
[4:29:36] <SharkWolfBlack> New Vegas, though.
[4:29:45] <alphonseisbest> NW THO
[4:29:45] <%doc_ock_rokc> I need to play that
[4:29:46] <%j0ustar> it's good, but not as defining as the original for its time
[4:29:53] <SharkWolfBlack> ah fuck, i'm old.
[4:29:54] <%doc_ock_rokc> New Vagas is LAST generation

[4:30:47] <+bear_breaker20> @optimasmaximas its goes backwards on plenty of things tho (mainly combat ai)

[4:30:51] <Mrbaconator> what's 5R?
[4:30:59] <$zyberion626> Persona 5 Royal
[4:31:01] <+StrawberryPantsu> P5 is HEAVILY front loaded
[4:31:02] <%j0ustar> P5R
[4:31:11] <Auriel_Astrum> I think there are some points in p5 which really don't need to be there and don't really add much to the story (cough cough Morgana)
[4:31:13] <%cvp5127> i see it
[4:31:21] <%optimasmaximas> @bear_breaker20 true
[4:31:23] <%Zombrocom> Outer worlds was good but it didn't grab me like new vegas did

They're all really appealing to me, which is weird because in a lot of ways they're really different. Like, if you've ever played Dead Space, 4's a lot like a cross between that and RE3make.
