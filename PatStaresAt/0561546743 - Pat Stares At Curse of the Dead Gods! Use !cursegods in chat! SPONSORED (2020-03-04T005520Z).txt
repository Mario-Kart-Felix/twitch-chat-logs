Just got my talking sword that seems to be getting off when I kill people. it' like someone shoved Harley Quinns soul in a sword and Im not sure how I feel about it.

[0:16:04] <%vaporousTippler> If Pat could lie, he would.
[0:16:06] <%StrawberryPantsu> Shilling is not "Keeping it Real"
[0:16:06] <%j0ustar> Pat is the safe bet. They either get 1k sales or lose 1k sales
[0:16:07] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> That's what I like about you Pat. You keep it real, even when you're objectively wrong.
[0:16:07] <$daveronald> how much to keep it not real
[0:16:08] <%Frost_Quill> Keep it real and selling out is fine.
