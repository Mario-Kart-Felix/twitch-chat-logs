[0:16:46] <%nmaten> its not that bad
[0:16:46] <+CarlosEoM> Thanks for the PrideToucan @red_neinwun
[0:16:54] <%notgarza> It's like a 2000's webpage
[0:16:54] <%MegboyManuel> Pat hangs out in *that one weird* part of the housing district
[0:16:58] <%twoto858> I've had so many problems trying to get in via Square Enix
[0:17:07] <%Cactuskris> it´s not that bad
[0:17:09] <%Dwarven_Gaming> what about the NEW store?
[0:17:10] <%cowardman93> which is ASS
[0:17:11] <%kindashagg> On PS4 you can buy a bundle and just have all of them, good to go
[0:17:11] <andrei11dr> Isn't the fastest mount the Bike?
[0:17:15] <+Calern> they changed it
[0:17:23] <%Katashi25> Katashi25 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 9 months! Hey Pat, 3/4ths the way there. So what do you think of EVO this year? Much love, will play FF14 once I build my pc.
[0:17:27] <%michingmallecho> Mog station suck my dick
[0:17:28] <%ragingbrachy> is the mog station still the most scuffed thing ever?
[0:17:32] <%Dwarven_Gaming> what about the NEW stortheres a new store, mogstation isnt used anymoree?
[0:17:33] <tanarath> Also, they don't support the steam version
[0:17:36] <Man_in_the_Red> i played many an MMO back in the day so im lucky im predisposed to proprietary platform nonsense
[0:17:37] <%SirGO0SE> psaWhat
[0:17:39] <%thegreatbambe> 2.4? WTFF
[0:17:39] <%CrimsonDio11> @PatStaresAt they just updated the mogstation it is no longer the mogstation
[0:17:40] <$WackyXmand> Can I ask what server you play on or would that be too personal?
[0:17:50] <andrei11dr> Also how do you get the bike?
[0:17:52] <%SirGO0SE> oh son of a bitch
[0:17:59] <%Joustar_> F
[0:18:04] <%mike2hands> my dammed phone didnt tell me that u where starting
[0:18:04] <%SirGO0SE> yeah i can see that
[0:18:12] <%cowardman93> @andrei11dr you buy it off the squenix store
[0:18:13] <ManfredA> Pat's server is fairly common knowledge and it doesn't super matter, FF14 isn't the kind of game where you can bug someone easily
[0:18:14] <CruxAustralis> Steam is cheaper tho
[0:18:16] <+ArtofWar739> @PatStaresAt I legitimately couldn't play Shadowbringers until the beginning of this year because of mogstation fucking me over on using the cd keys
[0:18:16] <%xemnahort> xemnahort subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 40 months! Yo pat, no questions today just appreciate your stuff while not feeling well.
[0:18:17] <%SirGO0SE> ty for the complete answer :)
[0:18:21] <%Shadowthedigger> Naw Pat, be like me and buy it off of Newegg
[0:18:22] <Thalchampz> which is bullshit, i wish i could go to steam because the sub gets cheaper for me FeelsBadMan
[0:18:24] <%ragingbrachy> cool
[0:18:24] <KoyaMusa> yeah but get all the dogs tho
[0:18:25] <%dinnydanny777> Moon Pupper?

[0:20:10] <%MegboyManuel> raid food
[0:20:12] <%dinnydanny777> Come up with new recipees
[0:20:13] <%Shadowthedigger> All the food.
[0:20:14] <%cylish> ahh thanks @ennui_on_me
[0:20:16] <Jdrockefeller> everyone needs food, everyone needs pots
[0:20:16] <+Grizzytron> if you're going to level only one DoH, do CUL
[0:20:17] <%marsantas> Cul also has the BEST questline
[0:20:19] <ManfredA> but only for very specific times
[0:20:19] <+Eiiriika> people gotta eat!
[0:20:20] <%MegboyManuel> Culinarian is goddamn valuable lol
[0:20:26] <%BunnyEmperor> and the lazy raiders will always buy your shit
[0:20:26] <Tavlaani> crafting food and raid food PogChamp
[0:20:28] <Holycow8498> FOOD
[0:20:30] <%MegboyManuel> Raid food is SO valuable
[0:20:32] <ivanmistwalker> MORE FOOD
[0:20:33] <%dinnydanny777> Come up with the new recipeeees
[0:20:33] <%Mendin> @marsantas That doesn't sound like Weaver
[0:20:35] <%OhioNitsud> food is drugs?
[0:20:37] <ManfredA> CUL has a big asterisk in that you need to have it ready to go for bigger patches
[0:20:41] <%MegboyManuel> give me that cabbage fucker
[0:20:44] <$red_neinwun> culinary is good for dat RP money
[0:20:45] <%crimsonharvest> +Perception food
[0:20:49] <%crimsonharvest> for gathering
[0:20:51] <faldin> Culinarian and alchemist is super valuable to level
[0:20:53] <Man_in_the_Red> @ohionitsud performance enhancing, yes
[0:20:57] <XyraFhoan> gotta get that extra 6k hp at endgame, it's like life or death in some fights, real good
[0:20:57] <%ragingbrachy> A C H O O
[0:20:59] <$JojoPiero> Level CUL so you can Desynth
[0:20:59] <%SomeSageAdvice> bless you
[0:20:59] <zamzoph> @PatStaresAt what are the main gil-sinks for getting gil to be worthwhile?
[0:21:01] <%Shady_Squid> Great answer, thanks Pat!
[0:21:01] <%TONYOO101> big asterisk on the easy money, endtier food gives you big money, any buff food before the current top tier 80 food items are almost worthless
[0:21:03] <%dinnydanny777> Culinarian is the Ignis cosplay skill
[0:21:10] <ManfredA> @faldin Alchemist isn't valuable, it's fucking mandatory
[0:21:12] <%MegboyManuel> Culinarian and Alchemist are the most valuable classes for raiding
[0:21:26] <%Joustar_> I have made my food, I have grown powerful
[0:21:33] <+HelloImTom08> housing probably
[0:21:37] <+HelloImTom08> and glam
[0:21:43] <%nofestu2> nofestu2 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 18 months! Hey Pat, long time no see. Been busy with my new job, but I'm glad I could catch you today.
[0:21:49] <%Joustar_> Thanks for the PrideHeartL @nofestu2
[0:21:49] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> tip. don't level everything at once. unless you wanna burn out like me
[0:22:01] <Flakari> Good luck getting a house tho
[0:22:02] <%SomersaultJustice> glam, the only thing that matters
[0:22:03] <%tusk102> wowie
[0:22:04] <%Poncho_Freestyle> is gil premium currency in ffxiv?
[0:22:04] <%BunnyEmperor> items from past events
[0:22:07] <%SomeSageAdvice> 3 mil gil minimum
[0:22:07] <%MegboyManuel> Outfits baby
[0:22:08] <$red_neinwun> and glams
[0:22:08] <%valriot> GETTING A HOUSE IN 14 LUL
[0:22:09] <%Joustar_> sounds like real life
[0:22:10] <%VashyronM> Just get an apartment
[0:22:10] <ManfredA> also if you wanna craft level all your gatherers
[0:22:10] <+HelloImTom08> naw there like 3 mill
[0:22:12] <+Grizzytron> smallest house is 3mil iirc
[0:22:14] <+itsamarshian> he says as I'm running around to get mats for submersibles
[0:22:14] <%MyNameIsRasus> that sounds like the USA
[0:22:14] <ManfredA> unless you like being poor
[0:22:16] <$JojoPiero> Small houses are 3mil or so
[0:22:19] <moosemonkey397> small plots are 3m
[0:22:19] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> but I level everything at mad first cus I'm just that person
[0:22:19] <$WackyXmand> I did that with my first relic just bought the weaker weapon off market
[0:22:19] <%tusk102> @Poncho_Freestyle no, it is the only currency
[0:22:21] <Holycow8498> There is no premium currency in the USA
[0:22:23] <%crimsonharvest> i reached 12 million gil and dont feel like getting no return at all from buying a house is worth it
[0:22:23] <@BigNaturalMan59> whens ffxi thebetCas
[0:22:28] <Holycow8498> and yeah small plots are around 3 mill
[0:22:29] <+Eiiriika> still more realistic than getting a house irl
[0:22:31] <%BunnyEmperor> true
[0:22:31] <clockworknate> @PatStaresAt Why is it every time I take a break for a month, I get kicked out of my F.C?
[0:22:31] <%dinnydanny777> Oh god this talk about housing is too real

[0:23:22] <Holycow8498> Dragoon is usually the easiest to learn and pick up but its gonna be harder to master
[0:23:23] <%animaturgy> That dragoon 80 armor is rad
[0:23:24] <%SpcOpsBear> DRG has NEVER been nerfed (in PvP)
[0:23:25] <+gaemjurnalist> JOIN THE MCH CULT

[0:23:27] <%cowardman93> Dragoon is REAL fun
[0:23:29] <%Noelle_of_the_Nova> Go MCH, its amazing
[0:23:30] <ManfredA> @BoBoCatBurger don't level multiple combat classes before you have a decently high level on your main, the armory bonus makes it less efficient to do so
[0:23:31] <RoboFussin> Dragoon always makes a good scapegoat too
[0:23:31] <Man_in_the_Red> Ninja is in high demand
[0:23:33] <+Eiiriika> rdm is super bunga which is a good start
[0:23:34] <+HelloImTom08> @BoBoCatBurger just dot the MSQ on your main and get one job to max lvl
[0:23:34] <%MegboyManuel> dragoonz are always bad
[0:23:35] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt what is the worst class not in terms of actual usability but in terms of how much shit you have to deal with coming from your party? is it healers?
[0:23:37] <Ciglossonjr> FLOOR TANKS
[0:23:38] <%MegboyManuel> tank the ground
[0:23:38] <%Starotter70> Can confirm, Dragoon is simple and fun
[0:23:39] <%valriot> Play Black Mage for B I G
[0:23:39] <TsundereFFXIV> DRG was bad in 2.4 when they had bad MDef and died to every raidwide
[0:23:40] <%dinnydanny777> Dragoon is the cosplay Kain class
[0:23:42] <%sshen> that's why ssaryn plays DNC
[0:23:44] <+abrupt_abe> Bad a madman and push all the buttons with MCH

[0:23:51] <+HelloImTom08> @BoBoCatBurger to start with
[0:23:52] <Holycow8498> Also Monk and Samurai
[0:23:56] <ManfredA> Dancer is easy but you also need to know who's worth buffing
[0:23:57] <$SpcOpsBear> Oh wait, I think DRG actually never got nerfed in PvE
[0:23:58] <%GinAndRoses> lan scroporal
[0:23:59] <DarkCloud79> Dragoon is also a good tank, they can tank the floor

[0:28:39] <%cylish> Kinda think a class based on terra would be cool
[0:28:41] <%blaccbird914> can you solo class/job this game? Or do you need to level up all classes/jobs?
[0:28:46] <%kindashagg> @Grizzytron I'm gonna go read on that
[0:28:47] <Jdrockefeller> the solution is to run healer and rescue him like skullgod

[0:33:33] <Skullgonian> Hey Pat, have you played Dancer? If so, do you know how much of a damage boost Technical Finish is? Standard Finish is 5%, but I can’t find how much Technical Finish is online, and in game is obviously no good at telling you what your own buffs do from time to time.

[0:40:24] <Skullgonian> @manfreda By the way, my tooltips don’t tell me any such thing about damage increased specifically. It just says ‘Damage dealt is increased’. Whether I mouse over the buffs themselves or the moves, I don’t get numbers like I do for other damage buffs (Dragon Sight, Kaiten). Do you know why that’d be?

[0:43:36] <Sydin18> I SMELL A DORK KNIGHT
[0:43:39] <MrNoremac208> can we all agree that black mage sucks
[0:43:51] <+Eiiriika> BLM is cool tho
[0:43:52] <ManfredA> BLM is the best dps
[0:43:52] <Aeonknight_87> no we cant
[0:43:54] <%Carpe_Deez_Nuts> When is the Mime class coming to FFXIV
[0:43:55] <kozboz96> ninjas not a starting class unlocked at `5
[0:43:56] <Aeonknight_87> BLM is super good
[0:43:57] <ManfredA> literally
[0:43:58] <Chaossheep> BLM sucks to level
[0:43:58] <kozboz96> 15
[0:43:59] <Deebo305> Also because they are only available in Ishgard
[0:44:02] <%Noelle_of_the_Nova> Dont' forget that SCH and SMN level together
[0:44:03] <%TheShal> BLM 4 lyfe
[0:44:06] <MrNoremac208> I didnt like it lol
[0:44:06] <Chaossheep> but it's a sick ass class at endgame
[0:44:12] <%BunnyEmperor> BLM is bad pre 70
[0:44:14] <andrei11dr> Warrior is weird ,because they are tanks that also get huge damage
[0:44:17] <+Eiiriika> BLM is sick cause like, you gotta learn to play fights totally different
[0:44:17] <ManfredA> BLM sucks til 60
[0:44:17] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt what is the worst class in terms of how much salt you have to deal with coming from your party? is it healers or what?
[0:44:18] <%Ranryu692> Ranryu692 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 25 months! Yesterday I finished listening to the 142 Friendcasts from before I started, and I kept track of "what statement was most proven wrong by time?" For a while it was your statement that "Capcom will be dead in 5 years," 5 years before RE2 and DMCV came out,
[0:44:20] <%SomersaultJustice> why don't you embrace turret pat
[0:44:21] <%templar010> BLM sucks ass at low level but BANGS at high level/max
[0:44:24] <ManfredA> and then sucks again but less til 70
[0:44:25] <+trizetacannon44> You don't get SCH till 30
[0:44:28] <Chaossheep> You throw down your circle, and you do not leave your circle.
[0:44:28] <Ciglossonjr> But when you hit 50 you can also go straight into SAM or Red which is exactly what everyone should do because they’re fun AND meta
[0:44:28] <%weissguard> WHM. You no die.
[0:44:31] <%dinnydanny777> Can you over level?
[0:44:32] <MrNoremac208> BLM is bad post 80
[0:44:35] <%valriot> LUL
[0:44:37] <%animaturgy> BLM is fun to level via Palace of the Dead, so you can level using your fun spells
[0:44:50] <Shillk> it's gladiator at the start
[0:44:51] <Sydin18> UR FIRST CHARACTER IS GONNA BE DRG: FACT
[0:44:52] <%PhantomMiG> So me

[0:44:53] <%valriot> DO. THE. FUCKING. STORY.
[0:44:54] <ManfredA> BLM sucks in Palace
[0:44:55] <%BoneofMalkav> A Pat-Ladin
[0:44:59] <%miguelrod777> I picked monk
[0:45:02] <%sshen> BLM is terrible in POTD/HOH
[0:45:04] <ManfredA> it's a class about staying still in an area where it's constant running
[0:45:07] <%tusk102> do the story fucko
[0:45:09] <MrNoremac208> PLD 5eva
[0:45:10] <%LaughingCatt> do that gaddang MSQ
[0:45:11] <LonelyGamingTime> first char pick bard no casts no positionals just buttons
[0:45:19] <@commanderclaw> Your first character takes like 250 hours thanks to the MSQ
[0:45:19] <zamzoph> I did it
[0:45:20] <+HelloImTom08> dont do that
[0:45:22] <%ragingbrachy> what if you end up hating the job
[0:45:23] <+HelloImTom08> its wrong
[0:45:26] <Ciglossonjr> Bard gang
[0:45:26] <%cowardman93> I started WAR then switched to DRG LUL

[0:45:32] <%xWanderingFlame> psaBig
[0:45:33] <+Grizzytron> friendship ended with multitasking. now ARMORY BONUS is my best friend
[0:45:34] <%Mendin> I did that but I'm in 2.0 so I can't go higher :V
[0:45:35] <andrei11dr> Because they are you're main ,and you get the main to cap
[0:45:35] <%MagicBeanBurrito> I did exactly that with ninja and sam
[0:45:36] <friggnodin> its not stupid its fun >.<
[0:45:45] <%Areus> Too late triHmm
[0:45:50] <%Ranryu692> I did that!
[0:45:51] <%Nekros4442> Oh did they do that exp update?
[0:45:51] <%afronooch> MSQ throws exp at you
[0:45:58] <%BunnyEmperor> yeah people overlevel now , its busted
[0:46:03] <JoshWithASpoon> I had a friend of mine get to heavensward at like 68 LuL
[0:46:03] <@mothmandraws> honestly you can probably make 80 pre stormblood
[0:46:05] <MrNoremac208> yup
[0:46:08] <%kindashagg> Started Stormblood at 70
[0:46:09] <%animaturgy> Duo black mages Fire IV melting everything is good times
[0:46:10] <Sydin18> also ur gonna get sick of ARR dungeons REAL FAST
[0:46:15] <MrNoremac208> its nuts
[0:46:17] <+mccf> I started playing xiv this week so this is nice
[0:46:23] <%thegreatbambe> yea post ARR gave me like 10 extra levels
[0:46:30] <%BoneofMalkav> Next, you change your Soundcard's IRQ from 5 to 7. Then you run the game's set up program, Then you run the soundcard detection and bitch about it not finding the right IRQ LUL
[0:46:31] <JoshWithASpoon> He was also grinding out the ARR Relic weapon at the time, so he overleveled the fuck out of the MSQ.
[0:46:34] <WackyXmand> 2.1 to 2.5 exp sucks though, i've barely level since beating RR
[0:46:34] <+InEzrealwetrust> fuck i love that button
[0:46:36] <Deebo305> This is true main Marauder/WAR and then leveled SMN/SCH stupid fast
[0:46:45] <%MegboyManuel> it also tells you where your next job quest is
[0:46:56] <Chaossheep> that button also shows you available class quests
[0:46:59] <aeonicvector> Literally required, cant beat Shadowbringers without 80
[0:46:59] <ManfredA> @WackyXmand post-expansion patches give shit experience because you're already at the optimal level to start the next expac
[0:47:04] <%LaughingCatt> 100%
[0:47:06] <%Evitron1> WHAT
[0:47:09] <%Starotter70> But what if my friends say that ARR is stinky?
[0:47:12] <%worldbrand> this makes me want to play tetris for some reason
[0:47:15] <Deebo305> who misses Road to 70 buff
[0:47:17] <%MegboyManuel> that little bar can point out where your next job quest is too.
[0:47:17] <@mothmandraws> I should do job quests im a lvl 80 DRK with no blackest kngiht
[0:47:17] <%BinaryFireball> does gear even reeaaaallly matter in this game? I'm on my first character and there seems to be a lack of variety of gear. Like no epic/ legendary stuff like wow
[0:47:21] <Secret_Wizard> You tell me this after I get all Jobs to 70 at the same time...
[0:47:21] <%LaughingCatt> 50% from 71-80 I think
[0:47:25] <Aeonknight_87> Yes, Armoury Bonus and Rested XP are not insignificant
[0:47:27] <%Evitron1> why would they not TELL me this???
[0:47:28] <%ladomania> does it stack with the other exp boosts
[0:47:31] <OneThousandTomatoes> your friend are stinky
[0:47:34] <%Broand> ARR is stinky but the ending is solid
[0:47:39] <@commanderclaw> Armoury Bonuses are nuts
[0:47:40] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt if the class you want to use is something you unlock later (like dark knight) should you just switch off once you get the class or should you continue with your starter class
[0:47:42] <%Toynota10> So you get a Warrior to 80, you only get the armory bonus for all Tanks?
[0:47:42] <%frydaynitefight> frydaynitefight subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months! wassup pat! hope yall are ok pet pp for me and keep on keepin on also thoughts on the new cyberpunk 2077 footage?
[0:47:43] <Sydin18> @ladomania yes
[0:47:44] <%MegboyManuel> I have a levle 50 WHM without regen, so really
[0:47:48] <%Toynota10> Or is it all classes?
[0:47:50] <ManfredA> ARR is just tedious but it's not as bad as people remember/act like
[0:47:53] <+itsamarshian> pretty sure armory bonus is just anything lower than your highest level
[0:47:54] <penitentpentwitch> Exp bonuses stack
[0:47:55] <%ragingbrachy> ok :)
[0:47:56] <KoyaMusa> tell them about rested exp
[0:48:18] <inksmears> ARR getting a huuuge upgrade and change next patch (aug 11th)
[0:48:31] <WackyXmand> that's going to be slow for me since i started with Monk
[0:48:34] <%Daxalog> Why is it done like this? Do you need to multiclass?
[0:48:37] <%SirGO0SE> you can change characters just like that?!
[0:48:38] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt should we ignore side quests to do main story?
[0:48:47] <Ghostdizzy> you can play final fantasy with a control?
[0:48:51] <Aeonknight_87> @Daxalog it's not needed, but all jobs can be played on 1 char
[0:48:55] <MrNoremac208> get monk to 70 fucko that story is really good
[0:48:57] <%BinaryFireball> that's big buff
[0:48:58] <+Eiiriika> yeah do msq pretty much the whole way
[0:48:58] <ManfredA> treat side quests like story
[0:48:58] <%Mendin> do not ignore job/class sidequests whatsoever
[0:49:00] <Aeonknight_87> @Ghostdizzy absolutely
[0:49:00] <ManfredA> er
[0:49:04] <ManfredA> sidestories in Yakuza
[0:49:10] <%FutaSnek> Ahh yes... those plaid beret wearing monks. I know of them well LUL
[0:49:10] <andrei11dr> Iea ,i only have Paladine and Dragoon to cap ,shit, my goblins
[0:49:12] <ManfredA> do them if you're interested
[0:49:13] <OneThousandTomatoes> Its there to make sure you dont kill yourself playing the game
[0:49:16] <%kindashagg> @Ghostdizzy Yes it's quite accomadating
[0:49:16] <ManfredA> ignore them if you're not
[0:49:20] <+TheeJelman> @patstaresat what if you want to play dark knight ? it isn't available from the start
[0:49:20] <KoyaMusa> also blue quests you should do, like ones that unlock flying
[0:49:23] <penitentpentwitch> Side quests are mostly for flavor, they give little exp. However any side quest with a "Plus Symbol" next to it unlocks content
[0:49:34] <%xWanderingFlame> psaUp
[0:49:44] <OneAboveAll> I like your Roe
[0:49:45] <ManfredA> also roundabout like Stormblood do sidequests for gear coffers
[0:49:50] <%Dwarven_Gaming> DO + QUESTS
[0:49:52] <zamzoph> @PatStaresAt I'm early in the post-ARR slog, but I find that my MSQ progress has been slowing to a crawl as I get distracted by dailies: roulettes (5 so far), (tradecraft) levequests, treasure maps, mini cactpot, and squadrons. How would prioritize the importance of various dailies so that I can drop some for more time on non-daily content?
[0:49:56] <%Toynota10> Always do dem blue side quests
[0:49:58] <cherrycottontail> 47-50 HahaThisisfine
[0:49:58] <%Starotter70> So do ALL the sidequests?
[0:49:59] <Saluko> @PatStaresAt Does race stats matter?
[0:49:59] <%SvenHolgersson> OH SHIT BLUE?!?!?!?!?!
[0:50:04] <WackyXmand> i did all the side quests in Coerthas and I wanted to die
[0:50:05] <%SvenHolgersson> I LOVE BLUE
[0:50:08] <%BunnyEmperor> blue quests mean important content unlock
[0:50:20] <knotsundownsyndrome> is palace of the dead still viable for grinding up to 50, or is there a new grind?
[0:50:22] <Aeonknight_87> Blue ! quests unlock things like dungeons and crafting and all that jazz
[0:50:28] <Aeonknight_87> hard modes or extreme modes of fights
[0:50:30] <%Toynota10> Don't gotta do em all. There's way too many yellow side quests. Just do Blue side quests to unlock stuff
[0:50:33] <Aeonknight_87> Blue ! unlocks content
[0:50:37] <ManfredA> @zamzoph ignore ARR leves and maps
[0:50:38] <Sydin18> I think I know the one
[0:50:39] <%sshen> race stats are a 1.0 hold over
[0:50:39] <Sydin18> YEP
[0:50:40] <%weissguard> Coerthas Side Quests WutFace
[0:50:43] <ManfredA> maps aren't worth doing until later
[0:50:50] <OneThousandTomatoes> how does it play on ps4?
[0:50:50] <ManfredA> trade levels get busted in HW
[0:50:57] <Veluren> Race stats mattered in ARR where Keeper Miqo'te had enough extra MP to get off an extra flare as BLM, but not since
[0:51:07] <Deebo305> @saluko Not true, play Lalafell highest dps race in the game Kappa
[0:51:09] <Cedgewik> leveling monk monkaS
[0:51:12] <KoyaMusa> @PatStaresAt after this talk about exp buffs like food, fc, squadron, and exp gear like aetheryte earring
[0:51:20] <+Basilias_Maximus> Oh that guy unlocks the Doman Enclave.
[0:51:20] <%Ranryu692> oh shit a shortcut
[0:51:22] <+Grizzytron> @knotsundownsyndrome PotD rips for all the way to 60. After that, there's a new PotD-style dungeon (Heaven on High) that is pretty good for 61-70

[0:51:26] <%Carpe_Deez_Nuts> @onethousandtomatoes plays perfect on PS4
[0:51:31] <%BinaryFireball> is playing with a controller good for ff14?
[0:51:32] <Ciglossonjr> BLU is the most POWERFUL class in Eorzea
[0:51:33] <%AlteisenReiseZ> GUNBLADES OF THE PATRIOTS
[0:51:38] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt what is the worst class in terms of how much salt you have to deal with coming from your party? is it healers or what?
[0:51:43] <Cedgewik> what server/dc is that?
[0:51:43] <thelonechris> Are you winning?
[0:51:46] <+Basilias_Maximus> I don't know why I bothered with it other than a glamour item.
[0:51:47] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> dont forget to talk about the challenge log! it gives easy money and exp
[0:51:47] <Man_in_the_Red> @deebo305 particularly since healers that click on party members instead of names can never find you in the fireworks Kappa
[0:51:47] <ManfredA> important tip: don't ignore learning your class in dungeons to just bumrush PotD
[0:51:51] <Aeonknight_87> @BinaryFireball it plays fine as long as you set it up in a way that works for you
[0:51:53] <%walternatorz> You haven't done that quest??
[0:51:54] <+TheOneCalledRock> BOY that UI is uh..... something
[0:51:54] <%ragingbrachy> yes :)
[0:51:57] <ManfredA> PotD will tell you jackshit about how to play your class
[0:52:01] <knotsundownsyndrome> @Grizzytron really, it's now up to 60? i know HoH exists, but when i was grinding, it was go up to 50, then do whatever at 60
[0:52:02] <+HelloImTom08> or lore
[0:52:07] <Veluren> The quests give you a lot of lore and worldbuilding, this game's world has a LOT of thought to it
[0:52:13] <@mothmandraws> oh one small thing, if the quest is a normal quest but has a picture on it its usually lore dump
[0:52:15] <%Starotter70> I'm such an easy bitch, not even an hour in and I'm thinking "I should re-up"
[0:52:16] <knotsundownsyndrome> but then again that was back in stormblood, and post shadowbringers i haven't grinded another class
[0:52:19] <Sydin18> (that one is a lore side quest tho lol(
[0:52:20] <@mothmandraws> that lady has a world building questline
[0:52:23] <%BinaryFireball> @Aeoneth thanks! I would worry about battle and abilities mostly
[0:52:24] <%FutaSnek> PICK A TOP TIER
[0:52:31] <%BinaryFireball> I should try it
[0:52:38] <%FutaSnek> FeelsGoodMan I love oj
[0:52:39] <Deebo305> Damn Pat didn't do Minfilia's mom sidequest
[0:52:41] <%ragingbrachy> delicious :)
[0:52:41] <+TheeJelman> don't quests that give you a pet have an indicator that sets it apart?
[0:52:41] <%worldbrand> pulp or no pulp?
[0:52:42] <ManfredA> @knotsundownsyndrome PotD is incredibly inefficient past 50, it's like 3 runs for most of a level
[0:52:45] <%twoto858> Orphans?
[0:52:45] <Ner234> Yum, Orange juice
[0:52:46] <%SirGO0SE> 1. dont play dps 2. level 1st character to max 3. buy juice
[0:52:47] <ManfredA> so you're correct
[0:52:47] <aeonicvector> @PatStaresAt YakMilk is grindable via kills
[0:52:48] <+Basilias_Maximus> Mineral water too.
[0:52:48] <chickenhunter> buy sesame cookies
[0:52:48] <moosemonkey397> boiled eggs are cheaper
[0:52:49] <OneAboveAll> what server is pat on?
[0:52:50] <OneThousandTomatoes> fight off scurvy
[0:52:52] <%Ranryu692> Jake Sisko fucking LOVES orange juice
[0:52:53] <%SirGO0SE> wait
[0:52:57] <%SirGO0SE> why do i care about orphans?
[0:52:57] <%MegboyManuel> no buy Milk
[0:53:01] <%xWanderingFlame> Pulp or not
[0:53:02] <%Invlux> Out of context that is such a statement
[0:53:03] <thelonechris> Fuck them kids
[0:53:05] <%TamsynRRD> @ManfredA If you're a tank or healer, doing dungeons while learning is an exercise in masochism.
[0:53:05] <%Kaask> egg
[0:53:06] <dagreenpillow> Stack to 1hr
[0:53:06] <%FutaSnek> @PatStaresAt And you dont get scurvy
[0:53:06] <%MidnightBurst12> orphans need the vitamin c
[0:53:08] <shiny_seaking> People giving advice in chat: it would help if you use fewer acronyms.... i dont know what all these acronyms mean yet lol
[0:53:09] <Sydin18> STEAK THO
[0:53:13] <%BinaryFireball> strawberry milk is better though
[0:53:15] <Cedgewik> tusk102 idk who gets the most salt but healers always seem to be in a permanent rage
[0:53:18] <Aeonknight_87> @SirGO0SE because Evangelion
[0:53:20] <%ekodrop> iron blooded
[0:53:22] <%apolitenoob> Doesn’t mineral water give the boost as well?
[0:53:22] <%Kaask> also negligible
[0:53:23] <+Kyderz3> wait...pat plays other jobs other than drk? Kappa
[0:53:24] <knotsundownsyndrome> @ManfredA that's what i figured, i remember being told not to do PotD past level 50
[0:53:27] <%Carpe_Deez_Nuts> Have 400hrs in FFXIV, and I've never used food, or any consumables honestly. am I a bad player?
[0:53:29] <%SirGO0SE> NotLikeThis
[0:53:31] <MrNoremac208> STEAK GANG
[0:53:31] <%FutaSnek> Hey 3% is 3%
[0:53:31] <+killer_squid1990> Heat of Battle!
[0:53:32] <tanarath> Pat, I'd like to level, but life is stressful af & it feels like healer or tank would be super stressful. I'm down for dark knight or healers, but I'm at like level 20,wat do?
[0:53:36] <%FutaSnek> I'll take it
[0:53:37] <%ragingbrachy> ok :)
[0:53:39] <ManfredA> @TamsynRRD dungeons are more efficient for healers/tanks cuz of quick queues and you need to learn to actually be a tank/healer even if it sucks
[0:53:41] <TioXyco> 3% is a lot in the long run
[0:53:48] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> Free Company Buffs
[0:53:50] <Aeonknight_87> @Carpe_Deez_Nuts in casual content it's fine
[0:53:53] <%SpcOpsBear> I wish they'd just add drinking water as food.
[0:53:53] <%Starotter70> NO
[0:53:53] <knotsundownsyndrome> i am curious though: if someone wants to learn how to tank, dungeoning does not seem like the absolute best way. what is a recommended way to learn tanking efficiently?
[0:53:54] <%FutaSnek> monkaS
[0:53:55] <%thegreatbambe> no
[0:53:55] <Cedgewik> Carpe_Deez_Nuts idk about bad but probably not efficient lol

[0:54:39] <%xemnahort> doodBarf doodOuch
[0:54:41] <Cykron> This is where I draw the line
[0:54:42] <%ragingbrachy> you can just join any old FC. people are always looking to take in newbies.
[0:54:44] <%a_c_chirns> Free Company = FC = Free Friends PogChamp
[0:54:44] <%SirGO0SE> can we start a freecompany called <Pat's Chat> ?
[0:54:44] <%liflamor> psaDown
[0:54:44] <%Daxalog> Not worth it
[0:54:45] <CHVMPLOO> hi friends :)
[0:54:46] <%Agami23> if you are in pats discord, ask momo or shen about ELMIG
[0:54:46] <+mccf> friends don't pay my sub
[0:54:47] <OneThousandTomatoes> but I played xenoblade because I don't have friends
[0:54:48] <+TheOneCalledRock> like
[0:54:49] <andrei11dr> Friends aka ,people to yell at in rades
[0:54:51] <%tusk102> i say "EWWW" but i literally already joined a company
[0:54:55] <%ragingbrachy> you dont have to talk to anyone there :)
[0:54:55] <+Drega707> or rank up in your grand company and use the rewards LUL
[0:54:56] <%afronooch> conversely, get lucky nd get randomly invited into an FC
[0:54:57] <WackyXmand> join a free company, there nice and can help beast early game bosses if you cant find people in Duty Finder
[0:54:59] <%SomersaultJustice> you could also make your own free company and get buffs like that
[0:54:59] <%BinaryFireball> can I just make my own free company with blackjack and hookers?
[0:54:59] <%BunnyEmperor> friends Kappa
[0:55:03] <%TamsynRRD> @ManfredA The thing that keeps me from learning healer and tank is getting raged at when I'm not top tier pro gamer dealing with uber size pulls.
[0:55:13] <aeonicvector> Freinds? Oh you mean the trust system
[0:55:14] <MrNoremac208> @patstaresat I can't make friends I get a sick satisfaction from denying FC requests
[0:55:15] <%Puhff> Don't freak out y'all, lots of FCs are put together just for buffs so nobody actually talks to you :)
[0:55:17] <%Daxalog> How long?
[0:55:17] <Cykron> Just join a company and never talk to them again
[0:55:18] <%xWanderingFlame> psa1guy
[0:55:22] <%FutaSnek> So.... "Friends with benefits?"
[0:55:23] <%SpcOpsBear> Guys, the Patron discord already has an FC. It's called Warriors of Elmo, or <<ELMIG>>.
[0:55:23] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt are there guilds or are the companies the guilds
[0:55:26] <%walternatorz> the real advice, taking advantage of healer/tank friends
[0:55:27] <+TheOneCalledRock> how do people make friends. doesn't everyone fucking hate each other?
[0:55:30] <%Starotter70> Yeah, healers get in with like 5 secs
[0:55:30] <%Invlux> Mooch off your guildmates for profit
[0:55:31] <Sydin18> NO, MARRY THE HEALER, AS WELL AS THE TANK
[0:55:31] <%SvenHolgersson> NOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[0:55:31] <%ragingbrachy> no :)
[0:55:32] <%sshen> a bunch of people from the discord made a FC called elmig
[0:55:33] <%SpcOpsBear> So you don't have to "make friends", you can just join ELMIG.
[0:55:34] <%SvenHolgersson> YOU CAANT MAKE ME
[0:55:35] <%BubbaRands> But Whawht if Noah won wiles Me?!?? BibleThump
[0:55:36] <Solidus_113> respect your healers
[0:55:37] <AlexandraReynardine> Heat of Battle II gives 10% exp
[0:55:38] <%SirGO0SE> so...if i play healer...i will have..friends?
[0:55:40] <%BunnyEmperor> benefits with friends
[0:55:42] <Ghostdizzy> im a lvl 75 tank anyone want a frendo?
[0:55:43] <+holidayMD> I don't know if pat has mentioned it but do your class quest
[0:55:44] <%Dwarven_Gaming> MOOCH II
[0:55:45] <%Daxalog> Sounds awful
[0:55:45] <%SvenHolgersson> NO MOOCHING ONLY SMOOCHING
[0:55:46] <ManfredA> @TamsynRRD Ignore them. People like that are usually full on Dunning-Kruger. But don't try to just go full optimal when you're starting out. Know your own limits.
[0:55:47] <@mothmandraws> return the favour
[0:55:51] <%worldbrand> Why would i want to be friends with a gamer? they're all psychopaths
[0:55:52] <%eanscrale> Okay cool, but where do I farm Phrans?
[0:55:52] <%xemnahort> I actually have a friend who made a free company with 100+ people in 4 days by just saying that it’s just for the buffs
[0:56:00] <%Carpe_Deez_Nuts> I'd rather take the 30min queue times then have to make friends
[0:56:00] <+Basilias_Maximus> Shadowbringers have the earings.
[0:56:01] <%SomersaultJustice> shadowblood or stormbringers
[0:56:02] <knotsundownsyndrome> @PatStaresAt or have a freak accident in which you have an FC *missing* DPS and way too mean healers and tanks
[0:56:04] <$PhantomMiG> Waiting to be able to server switch
[0:56:05] <WackyXmand> running the story in RR was a hit or miss with good party members, lots of shitty tanks
[0:56:05] <+InEzrealwetrust> you get the DANK earrings
[0:56:06] <+killer_squid1990> ARR pre-order gave a Mog hat
[0:56:08] <ManfredA> Most people will understand being new at tanking/healing, just say so and take advice.
[0:56:08] <%Starotter70> @SirGO0SE You will have friends, but you'll hate all of them
[0:56:10] <+killer_squid1990> That gave Exp
[0:56:14] <%Puhff> @SirGOOSE friends who will hate/fear you
[0:56:17] <%ragingbrachy> i have that :)
[0:56:21] <KoyaMusa> actually 71, it works on 70
[0:56:24] <+CashWolf> it works at lvl 70 too
[0:56:25] <@mothmandraws> it also works when synched down
[0:56:26] <TioXyco> For those who don't want to join an FC but is high ranking in your Grand Company, you can make weekly Squadron Missions that give a scroll with the same Effect as Heat of Battle II (a 15% EXP boost) for 2 hours
[0:56:26] <%Kaask> until 71
[0:56:27] <ManfredA> people get pissed at bad tanks/healers who won't talk or take advice.
[0:56:27] <%Puhff> That earing is ***
[0:56:27] <zamzoph> I don't have that :(
[0:56:28] <+Eiiriika> it also gives you the good stats for that level
[0:56:31] <%SirGO0SE> Sounds like I'm healbird now :)
[0:56:34] <%xWanderingFlame> psaUp
[0:56:37] <%worldbrand> Add a reverb and Pat sounds like a preacher
[0:56:37] <aeonicvector> which is 406 on some servers
[0:56:38] <%unremarkableprodigy> And the ring
[0:56:41] <seaechiowai> what if you're the tank/healer but yiu never get that friend request
[0:56:41] <+gustavozxd> wait I just got here
[0:56:47] <%weissguard> I love this earring. And that ring. The earring just dangles off of my Viera's big ol' left ear. LUL
[0:56:49] <+Finaldragoon> don't forget the brand new ring
[0:56:59] <%TamsynRRD> @ManfredA Sound advice. My luck in MMOs is poor, though, and I usually end up with stalled runs because people leave when I can't heal uber pulls or refuse to do them because I don't know how to do is safely
[0:57:03] <%Puhff> My favorite thing about the earring is how it makes every other earring bewlow lvl 70 obsolete
[0:57:04] <+Grizzytron> Friendship Circlet, Brand New Ring, and Aetheryte Earring makes starting up new classes take almost no time

[1:04:24] <moosemonkey397> NO tanks get way more shit
[1:04:26] <%weissguard> If you're not doing your job, shit sucks.
[1:04:26] <@commanderclaw> Healers heal damage numbers while they take damage to their soul
[1:04:27] <%BinaryFireball> man Im an asshole
[1:04:28] <%Puhff> apatBig Yes
[1:04:29] <+slipdelasan> I'd say tanks do tbh yeah

[1:04:38] <%thegreatbambe> ?
[1:04:39] <+the22cstomp> tanks get shit on so much harder than healers, healers get baby booboo gaga
[1:04:39] <%Pengers> theyre the best players though
[1:04:40] <%Starotter70> LUL
[1:04:43] <%dinnydanny777> Tanks are holding back the virus
[1:04:43] <mr_red117> I just have it set to a macro

[1:04:49] <+CashWolf> topical analogy
[1:04:49] <LoneFonte> LUL yep
[1:04:49] <%MarylandJutsu> DPS are the shittiest
[1:04:50] <ManfredA> yeh
[1:04:50] <%SirGO0SE> PERFECT
[1:04:51] <andrei11dr> I would argue tanks get a lot of shit
[1:04:52] <%ragingbrachy> im too stupid to play any job in this game what do i do.
[1:04:52] <%SvenHolgersson> DPS are power bottoms
[1:04:52] <shiny_seaking> oh no
[1:04:53] <%liflamor> wow
[1:04:53] <%walternatorz> Pat is currently a big dick DPS
[1:04:53] <%gespenst25> LUL
[1:04:53] <+Drega707> In pf tanks get it way worse.
[1:04:54] <exack> Mask doesn't help with my numbers
[1:04:54] <Veluren> Healers in FFXIV are violent and dangerous and ready to let you hurt, unlike a lot of MMOs where they're abused like hell
[1:04:55] <@commanderclaw> HEALERS ADJUST
[1:04:56] <ManfredA> Healers are babied heavily in 14
[1:04:56] <+Grizzytron> anti-mask folks are IRL you-don't-pay-my-sub babies
[1:04:56] <%republicofu> truth
[1:04:56] <fug74> ADJUST
[1:04:58] <Disaster_Glennie> Very accurate
[1:04:59] <inksmears> 100% true
[1:05:00] <%BunnyEmperor> true
[1:05:00] <%ladomania> DPS asre oppressed please leave us alone
[1:05:00] <%BinaryFireball> thanks @Aeonknight_87
[1:05:01] <%xWanderingFlame> LUL
[1:05:01] <ManfredA> tanks get the most shit
[1:05:01] <+BloodyBurney> DPS are coated in Jesus blood
[1:05:03] <FlashFrame> DPS players are the Karen's of MMO games.
[1:05:03] <Dral54> Fuck the mask! i need more BIG number
[1:05:03] <NeonBleu> as a DPS, I feel attached
[1:05:04] <Veluren> This is the MMO for healers that have snapped
[1:05:04] <%eanscrale> That's unfortunately apt
[1:05:05] <elicoy> and then when they get shit on they wonder why they got shit on
[1:05:06] <aeonicvector> Big dick DPS understand the need for protections, how else will they be allowed to stay in the leylines
[1:05:06] <%dinnydanny777> The tanks are standing in front of the virus saying "You will go no further"
[1:05:07] <NeonBleu> attacked
[1:05:08] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> pat, talk about challenge log
[1:05:09] <+RowenCleric> thats really good actually....
[1:05:10] <%Toynota10> How do you feel about those Tanks that just eat all attacks and yell TANK PRIVIEGE
[1:05:11] <+cawi> sounds accurate as a tank player
[1:05:13] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt I main healer and I rarely get shit on by dps, unless they are black mages who think they are hot shit cause they "technically" highest dps in game atm, even though they rarely reach that number with how shitty they are at positioning
[1:05:14] <%Invlux> Please for the love of god stop pulling or I won't heal you when you die
[1:05:18] <%Kyoshikei> Dragoon does wear mask
[1:05:20] <%dinnydanny777> The Tanks are staying inside and shielding
[1:05:22] <Lionrebellion> what about the tanks that don't use cooldowns? @PatStaresAt
[1:05:24] <%thegreatbambe> @PatStaresAt Are there any video filter mods you would suggest?
[1:05:27] <%PlayingChello> Hey pat, have you heard of Mortal Shell?
[1:05:34] <%MarylandJutsu> well you ave to kill them
[1:05:40] <+the22cstomp> @Invlux if there's no wall to walls something is wrong
[1:05:42] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt so what advice do you give to someone wanting to be a white mage?
[1:05:44] <%Starotter70> I am the Tank now
[1:05:47] <%thegreatbambe> dead
[1:05:48] <thetruenicster> and both Tanks are dead
[1:05:49] <Dral54> Pat, DONT USE TORNADO KICK, its trash
[1:05:49] <BanSenpai> Prae. Speedrun strats
[1:05:51] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt Black magesz play blm cause they are terrible and thus take their frustration out on you when they chose to stand in fire to keep their damage buffs
[1:05:53] <%ragingbrachy> both tanks are dead monkaS
[1:05:53] <KoyaMusa> they're not following the boivin way
[1:05:54] <%xWanderingFlame> psaUp
[1:05:54] <%BunnyEmperor> but sometimes the tank may say I don't need a mask because I'm so bloated with immunity boosters that I am now immortal
[1:05:54] <SaltyBrim> No, you don’t have to kill them lol
[1:05:54] <%Kyoshikei> Dragoon does not wear a mask *
[1:05:55] <+Yakobro> LUL
[1:05:56] <%Arxel1> Maybe they have Sprouts with them
[1:05:56] <%xemnahort> The easiest way to trigger me is say 2 words “HEALERS ADJUST”
[1:05:57] <ManfredA> oh no it's not AFK
[1:06:01] <ManfredA> they're just bad
[1:06:01] <%notgarza> As a first timer, I hated this mission because I didnt even got to play until the bosses lol
[1:06:02] <@SSaryn> YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO WAIT YOU BASTARD
[1:06:02] <%walternatorz> they got locked out at the portal
[1:06:02] <+Grizzytron> you need to fight these ones though
[1:06:02] <%ZizerX> they got stuck lmao
[1:06:04] <%unremarkableprodigy> I main tank
[1:06:04] <fug74> both tanks bad
[1:06:08] <Man_in_the_Red> @tusk102 its totally possible to heal too much and waste mana

[1:06:42] <%SomersaultJustice> that show is awful
[1:06:43] <%tusk102> @Man_in_the_Red so try and focus healing rather than just use mass healing?
[1:06:43] <+Yakobro> @FutaSnek tabbed out, you can set it to use less when tabbed

[1:07:43] <+linSP> noobs will never reach the truth
[1:07:45] <Man_in_the_Red> @tusk102 remember to balance DPS because White Mage deal more damage than some DPS classes, and your healing is powerful enough you have some leeway
[1:07:51] <%afronooch> CUTSCENE IS DEATH
[1:07:52] <ManfredA> yep
[1:07:54] <%Starotter70> Well then
[1:07:57] <%MagicBeanBurrito> Seems ideal
[1:08:02] <ManfredA> this dungeon with skippable cutscenes takes like 10 minutes
[1:08:03] <+wabajck> you still can. just log out and back on and you skip the cutscene
[1:08:05] <%SirGO0SE> oh boy im the big hero!
[1:08:07] <%tusk102> @Man_in_the_Red thanks. So basically if i'm not healing i should be blasting?
[1:08:08] <%spiritofmojave> That can still sort of happen if people rush the elevator and you a new player are lost
[1:08:11] <%realm_forge> Hi Pat! Thanks for being one of my main inspirations to start streaming! Any tips for a beginner?
[1:08:13] <%ZizerX> what happened to me as well
[1:08:18] <%BunnyEmperor> just watch them at the inn by clicking on the book Kappa
[1:08:23] <%Poncho_Freestyle> new players atpCap
[1:08:25] <Jdrockefeller> Frontlines roulette will give MSQ levels of expierence
[1:08:26] <Man_in_the_Red> @tusk102 yep
[1:08:29] <%Nordguy> what's that monk shirt?
[1:08:31] <%xWanderingFlame> psaUp
[1:08:31] <%BinaryFireball> shouldnt it be like.... if one person hasn't seen it then they control if the cutscene is ultimately skipped?
[1:08:31] <%walternatorz> walternatorz subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 17 months! Other great low leveling options are Squadrons. Fast way to level up to 50/60 if you want to skip queues.
[1:08:32] <Jdrockefeller> for the firsdt one of the day
[1:08:32] <+Finaldragoon> it also gives a fuckton of Poetics
[1:08:32] <%worldbrand> I dont know if that's a good solution
[1:08:32] <%Ninestempest> whm doesn't do "more damage" than some dps jobs, it has a single spell that does a lot of damage and sometimes in stupid min-max scenarios it's okay for a tank to lose a gcd instead of the whm
[1:08:33] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt Hey pat just got back into ff14, got my astrologian's hud all customized and sexy with macros and organized icons Im so ready to heal some healers and leave filthy toxic dps to their fate uwu <3 is your company lookin for more nerd to play? <_< <3

[1:08:36] <seaechiowai> Micky Mouse playing MMO. nice
[1:08:39] <CHVMPLOO> good game
[1:08:40] <%dinnydanny777> That shcks just let people skip the cutscene
[1:08:40] <Jdrockefeller> if you like the PVP its also a good way to get exp
[1:08:42] <Master_Van> I got locked out of the 2nd boss because of cutscene on my first time in this dungeon
[1:08:43] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> talk about frontlines and challenge log
[1:08:43] <Ner234> SHitpost. Got it.
[1:08:43] <+GaiaGreen> god I love Praetoriumposting
[1:08:43] <JoveGar> wow this fucking sucks
[1:08:44] <%weissguard> Or compliments each other's fashion sense. @PatStaresAt
[1:08:45] <KoyaMusa> no it won't pat

[1:08:47] <$Bit_Byter> Cheer1000 Hello Orb of Red Anger, I've never found an MMO that grabs me but the genre is interesting to me. FF14 looks alright, would FF14 be a good one to jump into?
[1:08:47] <BunnyEmperor> hopefully
[1:08:48] <%FutaSnek> It's like that quest in Borderlands 2 where you have to sit for like 45 mins and listen to a grandma's story LUL

[1:08:54] <%Kaask> i hope so
[1:08:54] <+The_Protagonist> Thanks for the PrideFloat @xaviorc0852
[1:08:54] <%Poncho_Freestyle> is the game muted or are the cut-scenes silent?

[1:09:03] <%weissguard> PogChamp
[1:09:03] <%Toynota10> @PatStaresAt Another good tip for leveling in MSQ is to turn on "Join in Progress" so you can maybe join in deep in MSQ
[1:09:04] <%valriot> LUL
[1:09:05] <+gustavozxd> oh
[1:09:07] <%MrBorisMakarov> also don't forget to call Gaius, Golden Frieza
[1:09:10] <%Pengers> that would make more sense
[1:09:15] <ManfredA> THE EXP IS TOO GOOD
[1:09:15] <%D00msDayDan> so they're putting it in the ff14 content vault
[1:09:16] <+gustavozxd> crazy talk atpFeelsBeardMan

[1:09:57] <+grenberr1> i got cutsceen trapped for the first time the other day, everyone in chat was confused
[1:09:57] <+Yakobro> the logout is bannable @PatStaresAt

[1:19:32] <KoyaMusa> you don't do wanderers, do stone vigil/sohm al
[1:19:33] <+metalsiren31> Squadrons are DUMB
[1:19:34] <%valriot> LUL TRASH
[1:19:37] <Dral54> No elite dungeons no Trust tho
[1:19:38] <%Overlordkain> You are part of that "they"
[1:19:38] <Azathotic> Trust is only 70-80
[1:19:41] <TioXyco> @aeonicvector trusts are 71 and above only
[1:19:42] <%FutaSnek> Welp someone said no so I guess pat's wrong LUL
[1:19:43] <%Arxel1> I mean, if you DPS the enemy while staying in their AoE it means there's double the ammount of damage numbers! Double the DPS!
[1:19:44] <%Nordguy> yeah....
[1:19:44] <%StewTheGreat> squadrons are still pretty good up till 50
[1:19:45] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> titan extreme? unsync it for wonderous tails
[1:19:46] <+TheOneCalledRock> so i am guessing FF14 this is one of those things that super heavily mix LoR fantasy and sci-fi bullshit that's super dumb but also kick ass?
[1:19:47] <%transporterthesequel> Did you tell them to git gud?
[1:19:48] <%sshen> I did squadrons on all my dps
[1:19:49] <ManfredA> @cowardlord stand directly behind him for 80% of the fight, separate adds
[1:19:50] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt are you disappointed that Gaius is just some dude in a mask
[1:19:50] <%marsantas> I used them to get everything to 50, it wasn't too bad
[1:19:52] <%count_bob> Have you ever had mindgoblins about overleveling characters in an MMO? I'm level 55 now and just finished the ARR.
[1:19:52] <thecreecherfeecher> Yeah, forget squadrons.
[1:19:53] <+smevvster> Hit that palace life
[1:19:56] <%StewTheGreat> the level 50 and above dungeons are a nightmare though
[1:19:58] <+BIumen> yeah but you can make your group of friends :)
[1:19:58] <aeonicvector> @TioXyco For now =P
[1:19:59] <thecreecherfeecher> Do roulettes and spam them dungeons.
[1:20:05] <%spiritofmojave> Atleast Trust can't stand in orange and can heal you well, if not AOE/be quick
[1:20:07] <seaechiowai> Don't ignore danger signs. I don't care how good your DPS is. you're encouraging shitty play to noobs. -healer
[1:20:08] <Azathotic> @TheOneCalledRock Yes, but also reality bending stuff sometimes
[1:20:13] <+gustavozxd> best one to jump into
[1:20:14] <%unremarkableprodigy> Did pat already talk about the house that death built thing
[1:20:16] <moosemonkey397> just spend 90 years in potd!
[1:20:17] <+Criox1388> How’s Monk going?
[1:20:18] <%Nordguy> squadrons DO HABE an extra XP boost rho
[1:20:21] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> Haurchefant is bae and boy your squadrons must have been really shitty, its heavly class based for them.
[1:20:23] <%Joustar_> I got covid, earthquakes and a draught. July starting out R A W. fuck.
[1:20:31] <+gustavozxd> I bounced off every mmo I've ever played except XIV
[1:20:32] <%xemnahort> So guidlhests > command missions for pat?
[1:20:36] <+dredgyboi> unlike most games MMOS give you free trials
[1:20:37] <+Quinn_Carter> @TheOneCalledRock Final Fantasy has been doing this for decades
[1:20:40] <%thelaxinator> Nero is still talking
[1:20:49] <Sydin18> DO SKYBUILDERS FOR CRAFTERS
[1:20:57] <KoyaMusa> fates are okay stormblood one
[1:20:58] <%ZizerX> but you can't miss out on BOCKMAN
[1:21:01] <%xemnahort> @joustar_ ouch that’s rough, buddy
[1:21:02] <KoyaMusa> *onwards
[1:21:03] <+gustavozxd> is there ANY reason to do them all?
[1:21:05] <NJigglypuff> @thelaxinator yeah nero loves to talk
[1:21:06] <Dral54> Talk about Poetics gear so newbies can get sick loot
[1:21:08] <AlexandraReynardine> squadron mission suck at lvl 50, try the lvl 53 dungeon with them tho and check their HP XD
[1:21:11] <$metzselaar> If you aren’t interested in raiding, what else can you do after maxing out all levels?
[1:21:12] <%spiritofmojave> Yeah they're meaningless compared to FATE leveling
[1:21:14] <marshmallowowl> Haurchefant is best boy
[1:21:18] <@StridentSong> You can do the 10 Under the Armors for the Xp boost in the log, but that's about it
[1:21:19] <%MagicBeanBurrito> Hammer time in 3, 2, 1
[1:21:20] <+Yakobro> @gustavozxd need them for mentor roulette
[1:21:21] <+gustavozxd> it's so jarring
[1:21:21] <ManfredA> time for the GUNHAMMER
[1:21:23] <%FutaSnek> Nice catfish choker?
[1:21:28] <+BIumen> omg is that why nero is like that?
[1:21:30] <%FutaSnek> YO
[1:21:31] <%ZizerX> he swingin
[1:21:33] <%spiritofmojave> Such DEVE-STA-TION
[1:21:36] <%weissguard> Still a cool hammer. Wish you could get it.
[1:21:37] <+CaptainJax> Based Nero
[1:21:39] <%thelaxinator> Guildhests are actually good for farming commends, something that is morally ambiguous.
[1:21:41] <ManfredA> GUNHAMMER
[1:21:41] <+InEzrealwetrust> Man i wish they let us get this hammer
[1:21:41] <andrei11dr> @joustar_ Well look at good part,if you survived that means you were that much of a baller
[1:21:42] <%marsantas> yes yes
[1:21:44] <LBC921> That hammer looks sick
[1:21:44] <%SvenHolgersson> Get it in real life coward
[1:21:45] <Arex_Korudo> SUCH DEVASTATION is golden thou
[1:21:45] <%octavian_gish> HE WOULD LIKE THE NAMAZU
[1:21:45] <Aeonknight_87> @metzselaar craft, glamour, housing stuff, RP, whatever
[1:21:45] <%BunnyEmperor> yeah that earring is the best
[1:21:46] <thecreecherfeecher> The fishmun.
[1:21:48] <%SvenHolgersson> Prove Woolie wrong
[1:21:49] <+goney> I want ARR Uriangier back
[1:21:49] <%FutaSnek> That's fair there pretty dope
[1:21:50] <%spiritofmojave> I love hammer
[1:21:50] <aeonicvector> @PatStaresAt Not hte Nu Mou?
[1:21:51] <KoyaMusa> pat did you get their mount yet?
[1:21:52] <%TheFabledAble> 14 is good, but if you bounce off MMOs you might enjoy GW2. Its made specifically to be accessable to people who bounce off MMOs, its Event system completely replaces quests in 99% of the game and the events are extensive and well designed and VERY rewarding.
[1:21:54] <+Criox1388> Changed for the better IMO
[1:21:54] <%Ranryu692> I love Nero's armor design
[1:21:55] <saraizarai> Namazu are what moogles should've been
[1:21:55] <%Joustar_> @xemnahort this year coming out with all the surpise left hooks
[1:21:56] <ManfredA> IT'S A GUN AND A HAMMER
[1:21:57] <DexteraXIII> I really like the ironworks gear
[1:22:00] <ManfredA> IT'S A GUNHAMMER
[1:22:03] <+smevvster> @metzselaar Crafting, gathering, leveling other classes, socializing,
[1:22:08] <%Nordguy> they're just lalafell fish
[1:22:11] <%Carpe_Deez_Nuts> rip original Merlwyb
[1:22:11] <%BunnyEmperor> Steel Reason SourPls
[1:22:15] <+gustavozxd> gunhammer job when
[1:22:24] <ManfredA> new Merlwyb hurts
[1:22:31] <+RenoDeGeneric> Still hating Monk?
[1:22:31] <ManfredA> good thing they basically removed her from the game
[1:22:32] <%dinnydanny777> Pat's character knows kung fu
[1:22:33] <+dredgyboi> this is taking longer than usual
[1:22:35] <+wjones0415> when will we get garlamald empire armor?
[1:22:36] <%ZizerX> I love how the namazu questline is that they're unknowingly doing conservation work
[1:22:38] <TioXyco> Original Merlwyb had a "SEVEN HELLS!" that was REALLY powerful
[1:22:38] <%Joustar_> @andrei11dr If I ever have grandchildren they're going to have good stories to listen to.
[1:22:39] <%spiritofmojave> didn't even ranged pull sbfpSetIn
[1:22:40] <+gustavozxd> Urianger was basically ignis and it's sad that he's gone
[1:22:46] <%SomersaultJustice> NAN TE KO TA!
[1:22:56] <RootVeggie> Dungeon ruined, just wipe
[1:22:57] <DiscoNinjaWolf> Hey pat how am I supposed to do msq roulette if you are also doing msq
[1:22:58] <+Story_Ark> im still on heavensward lol
[1:22:58] <WackyXmand> @PatStaresAt should I change classes before I start a expansion?
[1:22:58] <ManfredA> this group is phoning it in super hard
[1:22:59] <+Ilpala> MUCH GAMEPLAY
[1:23:01] <saraizarai> It's kinda a shame considering how boss nero is
[1:23:02] <%Dwarven_Gaming> NEXT CAPE WESTWIND
[1:23:10] <+BIumen> it almost would make more sense as a solo
[1:23:11] <@SSaryn> Get some Punching Gloves nerd
[1:23:11] <+linSP> you can play another game
[1:23:12] <%Starotter70> Truly, a fight for the ages
[1:23:13] <+gustavozxd> I went afk for this once and people got angry at me
[1:23:16] <Demonwolf630> its just long to do
[1:23:16] <%Arxel1> That's almost as long as dabbing on the general on the cliff LUL
[1:23:18] <%thelaxinator> Remember to ask Baelsar what pirates say before he yells "yyeeeaaaaarrrrghhh"
[1:23:21] <%apolitenoob> Oh man Cape Westwind lol
[1:23:21] <zamzoph> I wish there was a hammer/mace class

[1:23:35] <%dekkitout> Wh--what?
[1:23:35] <aeonicvector> @WackyXmand Change when you get access to what you want to beat though, since usually its on the same level (eg gunbreaker at 60 or redmage at 50)

[1:24:54] <+Story_Ark> i only recently got into ffxiv, so going straight from alph's ARR voice to HW was super drastic
[1:25:01] <Ghostdizzy> i feel like law and order is too old and bad
[1:25:01] <+Grizzytron> Time for big ol Gaius and his Piss Armor
[1:25:03] <Aeonknight_87> @andrei11dr the ultimate raids

[1:25:17] <ManfredA> @andrei11dr Yomi EX or Hades EX
[1:25:20] <%dinnydanny777> I love that version of Tainted Love with the sound effects from Law and Order
[1:25:23] <%rumtumtugnutz> ilvl is generally normalized for your low level quests
[1:25:25] <ManfredA> for the music and cool fight design
[1:25:27] <AlexandraReynardine> it feels so weird that only half the cutscenes in this dungeon have voice acting
[1:25:33] <%SomersaultJustice> his beret means he works at McDowells
[1:25:37] <@SoFarFetched> What a great cumback LUL
[1:25:38] <zamzoph> @PatStaresAt when still on MSQ (post-ARR for me), what dailies should be kept up on? There's so many dailies that I don't have time for anything else!

[1:26:21] <%spiritofmojave> and do you believe in EORZEA
[1:26:22] <ManfredA> tl;dr leveling, trials and alliance raids if you want levels

[1:26:41] <Sydin18> Thanks for the PrideCrown @realm_forge
[1:26:42] <+Story_Ark> on the other hand, I did too many roulettes after I beat ARR recently so now I'm overleveled for Heavensward
[1:26:43] <%Arxel1> YEEEE BEAST TRIBES

[1:27:05] <thetruenicster> Oh yeah, Gaius was originally voiced by Richard Epcar
[1:27:09] <Aeonknight_87> Gaius talking shit about your gods
[1:27:12] <%Dwarven_Gaming> ok we will NEVER hear about WTF the twelve was
[1:27:13] <%dinnydanny777> I mean I recognise him at least
[1:27:15] <%thelaxinator> 2.0 beast tribes aren't too bad, you can blow all your allowances on one tribe by the end
[1:27:17] <+deanbees> @Story_Ark I wouldn't worry about being overleveled in this game honestly. It just trivializes the boring parts.

[1:27:50] <+ALazo> It's so easy to not
[1:27:50] <Sydin18> The Twelve are like the Nine Divine in Elder Scrolls where they dont do shit

[1:28:02] <%Carpe_Deez_Nuts> I started Heavenward with a lvl 64 Summoner. it's what compelled me to start Lancer(Dragoon) Archer (Bard) and Dark Knight
[1:28:03] <cherrycottontail> Don't even think about dying, you're too bloody useful!

[1:29:48] <%Carpe_Deez_Nuts> For the people saying there's no need to touch children cuz of porn on internet, I must also die on the hill that watching child porn is also not very cash money

[1:30:40] <KoyaMusa> and to think the min ilvl for this dungeon is like 48
[1:30:41] <zamzoph> @PatStaresAt was there ever a time when Pratorium was challenging?
[1:30:43] <OneThousandTomatoes> I've proposed using discord in some of my college classes, but the memes make that hard
[1:30:45] <%Double_Tap_That> What's your opinion on using Deep Dungeons to level?
[1:30:45] <%xWanderingFlame> psaOrange
[1:30:46] <+the22cstomp> infernitus

[1:30:47] <%xemnahort> @carpe_deez_nuts there’s lolis that’s like basically the same thing and while morally questionable is still better than child porn
[1:30:48] <ManfredA> BEFITS A RULER
[1:30:50] <+BIumen> join me luke
[1:30:52] <%spiritofmojave> MOST IMPRESSIVE
[1:30:59] <MrNoremac208> Epcar is hamming it up so hard
[1:30:59] <%SomersaultJustice> it was somewhat back during 2.0, but not really
[1:31:01] <TioXyco> 2.0 I heard it was challenging
[1:31:01] <Sydin18> Ur all about to learn that the Ultima Weapon runs on Code Red Mt Dew
[1:31:04] <@StridentSong> Not even when it was new.
[1:31:04] <+the22cstomp> it was rough-ish on release
[1:31:06] <%Ninestempest> On release it kind of required attention but that's it
[1:31:06] <Byr0nX> look at my gold armor
[1:31:07] <Aeonknight_87> Praetorium was hard during the first few months when we were all underleveled
[1:31:07] <snowmanse> You would get people who died to the first Ultima fight
[1:31:10] <moosemonkey397> Yes. when it was current it was pretty rough
[1:31:12] <%thelaxinator> I enjoy deep dungeons, most people absolutely hate them
[1:31:12] <clockworknate> Army's dont hate people , people hate people
[1:31:12] <snowmanse> at launch
[1:31:12] <+Story_Ark> Was there ever a time where that one trial before this was challenging? I did it and finished it in legit 10 seconds
[1:31:12] <+the22cstomp> but like not really otherwise
[1:31:14] <LonelyGamingTime> Do a min ilvl run to find out? lol
[1:31:15] <%gespenst25> At launch at like i45 it was tough
[1:31:17] <%realm_forge> Pats character looks like such an ass hole
[1:31:19] <+gaemjurnalist> MOST IMPRESSIVE
[1:31:19] <%Overlordkain> It was always easy, some people sucked on ultima though
[1:31:24] <trinityxlv> nah, we farmed this shit instead of the dreaded demon wall with 2 bees
[1:31:25] <%Leftovermemes> any suggestions for really good level 80 armor other than just allegory? I use all my roulettes for allegory
[1:31:26] <%Overlordkain> the first ultima
[1:31:26] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> Well if i can get a discord link one day that would be nice
[1:31:27] <Byr0nX> and now the gundam
[1:31:27] <%Ninestempest> People would die to the ultima enrage lol
[1:31:27] <zenith0111> God I hate doing Main Scenario roulette
[1:31:32] <vandesdelca70> msq is never hard they have to design their content to be beaten by people who like anime so
[1:31:34] <Veluren> I played at launch and remember Ultima lasting long enough to get off an LB3
[1:31:37] <saraizarai> I started in 2.1 I was already getting cutscene locked
[1:31:39] <%SomersaultJustice> and now the Devil Gundam
[1:31:39] <waddle_dee1992> what server is this on?
[1:31:39] <KoyaMusa> yeah the min ilvl this thing is "designed" for is i45
[1:31:40] <Varrens> @patstaresat so you also remember the accuracy stat
[1:31:46] <%dinnydanny777> So after that he just runs away?
[1:31:48] <ManfredA> @Leftovermemes tome armors are catchup gear, all the good shit is in extremes and savages
[1:31:49] <%dekkitout> Is- IS THAT A MECH?!
[1:31:56] <seaechiowai> @jetsfantasy there are enough nerds in army for Magic the Gathering clubs to exist in every unit
[1:31:59] <%thelaxinator> Now for the part of the dungeon where the healer has to tank...
[1:31:59] <NJigglypuff> @vandesdelca70 you may think that, but chrysalis still exists
[1:31:59] <%spiritofmojave> Jesussss
[1:31:59] <%gespenst25> you could still wipe especially with half the people wanting to rush and two people still in cutscene
[1:31:59] <Tomschiii> @xemnahort they are nothing alike^^
[1:32:02] <andrei11dr> Man ,i love the imperial designs in
[1:32:02] <Aeonknight_87> @dekkitout it's a Mech yes
[1:32:05] <zenith0111> This is a legit 30 min. cutscene slog
[1:32:07] <KoyaMusa> remember cross class skills, oh swiftcast
[1:32:09] <%BunnyEmperor> so basically like synced minstrels ballad Ultima Weapon
[1:32:09] <chickenhunter> i missed getting a house 6 times this week and wow its just as bad as i've heard
[1:32:10] <Byr0nX> its a gundam!!!!
[1:32:11] <+Grizzytron> Cape Westwind is still the lamest wet fart of the 2.0 end stretch
[1:32:13] <+InEzrealwetrust> GET IN THE MECH GAIAS
[1:32:15] <%plumlungs> LB3 in Prae sounds crazy to me LUL
[1:32:15] <%spiritofmojave> You can barely get to LB1 unless everyone's new now
[1:32:15] <%Agami23> remember weapon type debuffs like piercing debuff?
[1:32:15] <%cylish> @dekkitout thats a god eating mech in fact
[1:32:16] <JoshWithASpoon> Leftovermemes If you haven't looked into the Neo-Ishgardian armor, I highly suggest looking into it! That or the Eden's Verse raid armor.
[1:32:17] <Aeonknight_87> @dekkitout it's a God eating Mech
[1:32:18] <%MagicBeanBurrito> thing got a vulva neck
[1:32:21] <%dekkitout> @Aeoneth What is this game.
[1:32:23] <%xemnahort> @tomschiii I don’t watch either so I just assumed
[1:32:29] <Sydin18> Gaius about to enter the gamer pod
[1:32:30] <waddle_dee1992> Cape Westwind is easy exp on Roulette, dont hate
[1:32:32] <AthenaAegis> So I guess it's just Xenogears now Kappa
[1:32:32] <%Metballs> lol healer accuracy
[1:32:32] <%dinnydanny777> So Gaius gets in gne mech and he still loses
[1:32:35] <+linSP> this looks like a dang ps2 game
[1:32:35] <%Joustar_> Behold, the ULTIMATE weapon that you will wreck in a minute
[1:32:36] <%dinnydanny777> the
[1:32:37] <+Story_Ark> I did Cape Westwind recently and didnt have time to even comprehend what was happening
[1:32:40] <%notgarza> METAL GEAR
[1:32:46] <%Overlordkain> I hate missing random trash in the wild that is a couple of levels above me and breaking a combo with the new system. Acc being gone is still better though
[1:32:47] <%silent_weapon> is that an evangelion?
[1:32:49] <%gespenst25> Fun fact everyone, in Japanese Gaius is done by the guy who did Wammu in JoJo. Awaken my robot!
[1:32:50] <%weissguard> Strident's Viera in general is on point.
[1:32:52] <%realm_forge> Why would you put wings in a 40ft mecha centaur?
[1:32:53] <%Wallabri> i take out my sword.... AND I PUT IT AWAY!
[1:32:55] <+Grayhammatter> Metal... GEAR?
[1:32:56] <%FutaSnek> PLAY DMC2 IS BEST GAEM

[1:32:58] <%gespenst25> also solid snake
[1:32:59] <%ragingbrachy> no
[1:32:59] <%dinnydanny777> It's a Bahamut
[1:33:00] <%SomersaultJustice> I'll defeat you, Undefeated of the East!
[1:33:01] <%BunnyEmperor> it's EXCELSIUS
[1:33:01] <%MrBorisMakarov> where did strident get that
[1:33:01] <%Carpe_Deez_Nuts> Yo i just got to the first dungeon in ShB and I can play with NPCs, don't even have to deal with real humans anymore. GOTY
[1:33:02] <Varrens> GOD i played Dragoon and it made no goddamn sense why I'd miss and loss combo ipf accuracy stat wasnt high enough
[1:33:02] <%lucaflowe> Remember when Titan EX was rough?
[1:33:04] <%xWanderingFlame> LUL
[1:33:05] <%walternatorz> GET IN THE WEAPON, GAIUS
[1:33:05] <+Story_Ark> but not THE ultima weapon, but the ultima weapon
[1:33:09] <%weissguard> IT'S COOLER THAT WAY.
[1:33:10] <%dinnydanny777> It's a mecha Bahamut
[1:33:10] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> cuz it can fly?
[1:33:11] <OneThousandTomatoes> and kool
[1:33:12] <+the22cstomp> it's fucking cool is why
[1:33:12] <zamzoph> It did fly in that one cutscene!
[1:33:13] <%Joustar_> because cool
[1:33:14] <Byr0nX> hellll no
[1:33:15] <+samuraijoe_> sounds like a gundam
[1:33:16] <KoyaMusa> also it actually can fly, at least the proto version
[1:33:19] <+InEzrealwetrust> It almost looks like the ff8 ultima weapon
[1:33:19] <Byr0nX> he fly
[1:33:20] <%dekkitout> That looks like something 12-year-old me would LOVE
[1:33:20] <ManfredA> it can in fact fly

[1:33:36] <%xemnahort> I’m still baffled with how much people in power rape when there’s so many people willing to have sex without force just because you’re a big name

[1:33:49] <thelonechris> Shoot it until it dies
[1:33:51] <ManfredA> Omega and Omega Weapon are different things
[1:33:52] <andrei11dr> The God Eating Mech ,even the The Ruby Weapon is like 40 level's higher

[1:34:01] <%thelaxinator> get your stacks up pat
[1:34:04] <%mMayrro> invulneragility?
[1:34:04] <%spiritofmojave> pro tip don't hit it if you're a healer
[1:34:05] <%dekkitout> I'd forgive it IF it had giant drills
[1:34:05] <+gustavozxd> invulneradility

[1:34:24] <Cykron> I love this song
[1:34:26] <%JonWhoLovesFlatWomen> crystal mommy!!!
[1:34:28] <Shillk> which class does piss damage?
[1:34:28] <%spiritofmojave> 7 crit Pog
[1:34:30] <OneThousandTomatoes> wash away the piss
[1:34:32] <Crimpson> Then you jst kill it
[1:34:40] <Byr0nX> eww youre playin wit a controller lol
[1:34:49] <%MagicBeanBurrito> I like having effects on and not being able to see shit
[1:34:55] <%VioletHeart> Game plays so much nicer on a controller.
[1:34:55] <Aeonknight_87> @Shillk they all do good dmg. but right now phys ranged is the "weakest"
[1:34:55] <seaechiowai> @shillk machinist
[1:34:57] <%briktal> I had a group almost wipe to cape westwind in shb once
[1:34:58] <OneAboveAll> why do you hate monk? @PatStaresAt
[1:34:59] <KoyaMusa> i can't play monk anymore man, i've mained it since hw and its just pain now
[1:35:01] <+Grayhammatter> piss damage? bard
[1:35:01] <NJigglypuff> playing an mmo with a controller is the best feeling
[1:35:03] <WackyXmand> I got the Castrum on my roulette
[1:35:03] <%ragingbrachy> this game is better on controller
[1:35:04] <+Ilpala> FFXIV is the best MMO BECAUSE you can play it with a controller
[1:35:04] <%Chichen> FF14 is perfectly fine with a controller
[1:35:04] <Ciglossonjr> Controller is the best way to play FFXIV
[1:35:04] <DrillStopsNoCops> I'm doing prae rn myself
[1:35:05] <+2DSuperiority> Yoshi P is gonna make fun of you on his Twitter
[1:35:05] <zamzoph> I'm not an accustomed MMO player, so I find the controller much easier to manage two dozen abilities
[1:35:07] <%xemnahort> @byr0nx yes the the controller, the true control scheme
[1:35:08] <%SirGO0SE> youre actually so good with the controller that im thinking i might play it with one too
[1:35:09] <+the22cstomp> machinist doesnt do piss damage
[1:35:09] <%dinnydanny777> How do you use all your abilities on a controller
[1:35:09] <%walternatorz> if the devs can't stop pat, no one can
[1:35:10] <KingVantq> mnk elitists LUL
[1:35:10] <+the22cstomp> lmao
[1:35:11] <+Dangasmic> PAT how do i become the Final Fantasy 14?
[1:35:16] <%thelaxinator> MNK is really bad low level, gets really good in late 70's
[1:35:17] <ManfredA> but you do big damage
[1:35:18] <+datmegamandeeeee> If you don’t like it, don’t put it there
[1:35:18] <Sydin18> Your mom is a giant rock and ur dad is a giant dragon
[1:35:25] <%lucaflowe> Monk is extra work lol
[1:35:26] <OneThousandTomatoes> Why did you choose the one you hate? just because it was lower level?
[1:35:27] <JoshWithASpoon> And SAM practically takes no work :)
[1:35:28] <%SomersaultJustice> pat hates asia confirmed
[1:35:29] <%thelaxinator> 4th stack Greased Lightning is quite nice
[1:35:31] <%realm_forge> Ultimate weapons got a dump truck on him
[1:35:31] <clockworknate> @dinnydanny777 button combos
[1:35:31] <saraizarai> Pat, did you learn to appreciate BLM?
[1:35:32] <JoshWithASpoon> Kappa
[1:35:33] <Byr0nX> as retired monk from Shadowbringers................................yes
[1:35:34] <%a_c_chirns> chores
[1:35:36] <KoyaMusa> they're still 2.0 animations which doesn't help
[1:35:36] <%spiritofmojave> DRG is twice as fun for way less the effort
[1:35:37] <+RenoDeGeneric> I like the aesthetic but yeah it's way too much work for similar, or what feels like LESS damage
[1:35:41] <$Fortunato5678> Ninja feels like more work
[1:35:41] <WackyXmand> also the Monk Job quest guy sucks
[1:35:41] <%Dwarven_Gaming> YEAH., drg got ALL the animation budget
[1:35:42] <%Invlux> Woolie would like to know your location
[1:35:46] <Crimpson> There are things that a controller just has more trouble doing than a keyboard and mouse
[1:35:46] <DrillStopsNoCops> PUNCH THE PRIMALS IN THE FACE. And the tushy. And the kidneys.
[1:35:47] <%CrimsonDio11> @PatStaresAt ever since I started playing ff14 Ive been wondering why 75% of the enemies that are in Allagan related areas are just ff13 enemies is there a reason for this or is it just Square reusing assets?
[1:35:48] <%xemnahort> @dangasmic you are what you eat so you must CONSUME it
[1:35:48] <+dredgyboi> I JUMP real GOOD
[1:35:49] <Kongro_> Yeah, monks could use some upgraded filler skills, at least visually.
[1:35:49] <+Grayhammatter> DRG is fun
[1:35:52] <%Daxalog> Whens the Mathamagician gonna be added? I want to be 2 height above you and then do nothing. OOPS.
[1:35:54] <+the22cstomp> samurai is not easy in savage raids
[1:35:57] <+Kelldav> Monk now doesnt feel as rewarding compared to other classes
[1:35:58] <+mccf> you weeb
[1:35:58] <%spiritofmojave> Yeah SAM is a breeze
[1:35:59] <%kindashagg> You get to whisper "Scum" to yourself while playing SAM
[1:35:59] <+datmegamandeeeee> Drg4lyf
[1:35:59] <$metzselaar> Monk is a mind set
[1:35:59] <+Story_Ark> Dragoon is super bad low level. at least right now, im leveling it and its boring
[1:35:59] <Byr0nX> It goes slash to
[1:36:03] <vandesdelca70> because samurai is so boring you want to die
[1:36:04] <%ragingbrachy> i dont understand how to play DRG at all
[1:36:04] <Aeonknight_87> @PatStaresAt SAM beats MNK as of Shadowbringers
[1:36:05] <+linSP> why would you not play the most optimal build
[1:36:05] <%thelaxinator> because punch
[1:36:06] <+the22cstomp> monk is comparably more easy
[1:36:06] <+andrewoid_> sam is top personal dps rn
[1:36:06] <%weissguard> Garlic Lahabread!
[1:36:08] <%Overlordkain> Elixer field is rad :x
[1:36:08] <+Grayhammatter> where we jumping bois?
[1:36:08] <%Joustar_> Pat doesn't like his black wifebeater + tiger print outfit
[1:36:09] <+Story_Ark> rather, lancer
[1:36:11] <+cawi> SAM is easy and has a rigid rotation with big crit numbers
[1:36:13] <OBS_VinnieK> Monk gets Power Gyser and energy beams though
[1:36:13] <%thelaxinator> Chemist though
[1:36:16] <OneThousandTomatoes> that is true
[1:36:16] <ManfredA> @CrimsonDio11 this game has FF12 enemies in it, just direct rips
[1:36:19] <%Daxalog> Woah!
[1:36:19] <DrillStopsNoCops> MOTIVATED
[1:36:19] <@SSaryn> Also if you wanna ask Time Mage, Astro exists.
[1:36:20] <seaechiowai> Just pick girl monk, they will look 10x better
[1:36:20] <+Story_Ark> Ninja is the best don't at me
[1:36:20] <%dekkitout> You can be a MATH NERD?! I need to play this
[1:36:21] <KoyaMusa> no monk does NOT need more filler skills that is part of the problem
[1:36:22] <JoshWithASpoon> SCH is essentially a Mathemetician job.
[1:36:22] <ManfredA> it's mostly asset reuse
[1:36:24] <cherrycottontail> chemist pls
[1:36:24] <Byr0nX> Monk gets good at 70 so...........
[1:36:24] <+fenix122> The difference between classes at max level (damage-wise) is minimal anyway, might as well play what you like.
[1:36:25] <%Overlordkain> Elixir* even
[1:36:30] <DrillStopsNoCops> Midare makes me MOTIVATED
[1:36:31] <%Daxalog> Yeah but Math > Stars.
[1:36:35] <%toastybites> !uptime
[1:36:35] <%a_c_chirns> IGNORANT
[1:36:35] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 36m.
[1:36:35] <OneThousandTomatoes> literally geometry magic
[1:36:35] <%ladomania> but pat I want to do algebra during raids
[1:36:36] <%NWR_James> @PatStaresAt When are you adding Mathmagician and why are you keeping it out of the game
[1:36:36] <ManfredA> NO
[1:36:38] <%Ninestempest> Astro barely has any time shit anymore
[1:36:39] <ManfredA> THEY DON'T
[1:36:42] <%thelaxinator> Weird how Tidus was a Time Mage
[1:36:42] <ManfredA> THEY TOOK THEM AWAY
[1:36:43] <+BIumen> scrape the bottom of the bravely default barrel
[1:36:43] <TioXyco> not anymore
[1:36:44] <%Ninestempest> the ONLY thing they have is lightspeed
[1:36:44] <Aeonknight_87> @dekkitout Arcanist turns to SCH and SMN. they use math to power magic.
[1:36:44] <%pectusumbra> But do they have the HAT THOUGH
[1:36:44] <+ultimafullmetal> Chemist please
[1:36:46] <zenith0111> BIG WRONG
[1:36:48] <%Arxel1> Monk's skills? Wack Monk's animations? Wack Monk's questline? Wack My class? TITE AS HECK
[1:36:48] <%Leftovermemes> give me geomancer and beast tamer plz
[1:36:49] <Ciglossonjr> SAM being stuck to using striking gear is FUCKING STUPID. They should’ve shared gear with fucking DRG
[1:36:49] <%count_bob> MUST NEEDS.
[1:36:49] <%Agami23> i want geomancer
[1:36:50] <Crimpson> When are they going to put in janitor class
[1:36:50] <%BunnyEmperor> Pat Astral Stasis does not freeze time LUL
[1:36:50] <moosemonkey397> Geomancer!
[1:36:51] <+samuraijoe_> beast tamer?
[1:36:52] <inksmears> not nanynore
[1:36:53] <+Story_Ark> blabla brea
[1:36:53] <%notgarza> Crazy talk
[1:36:55] <%SomeSageAdvice> they super took em away
[1:36:55] <+Finaldragoon> Geomancer is already in the lore
[1:36:56] <Byr0nX> shut up Lahabrea
[1:36:56] <ManfredA> YES
[1:36:56] <NJigglypuff> @PatStaresAt what healer classes do you think will be added then?
[1:36:58] <KoyaMusa> only one left is gravity on ast
[1:36:58] <saraizarai> And WHM's have looking at people intensely
[1:36:58] <TioXyco> they took them away with 5.0
[1:36:58] <+peekaytom> @CrimsonDio11 it's a holdover from the ff13 engine that ff14 `1.0 and like, i'm pretty sure maybe even current runs on
[1:36:59] <@SSaryn> Not all of them.
[1:36:59] <%Carpe_Deez_Nuts> Bahamut Akh Morn makes Summoner best job ingame
[1:37:00] <AthenaAegis> Yes, but is that class as broken here as it was in FF Tactics? Kappa
[1:37:00] <%Metballs> They still have gravity
[1:37:01] <%thelaxinator> Tidus was either a Time Mage or a Bard. Weird pull for a main character
[1:37:01] <cherrycottontail> astro was gutted
[1:37:04] <KnightAsteran> AST still has dilation
[1:37:05] <@SSaryn> Earthly Star still exists.
[1:37:05] <%shadowace2400> LB3
[1:37:05] <%Ninestempest> NOPE
[1:37:05] <%Metballs> And skill flavour
[1:37:07] <+dredgyboi> Astro has no time now
[1:37:07] <%Evitron1> How do I convince Alisaie to dunk on Alphinaud even harder. I like her turn in Stormblood but I want her to go in even harder
[1:37:07] <TioXyco> HAD
[1:37:08] <KingVantq> hotfixed the instant you said it
[1:37:09] <%Blackjack760> most of it
[1:37:10] <%Dwarven_Gaming> they took ALOT away
[1:37:12] <%Divryne> They still do.
[1:37:13] <%Ninestempest> Astro lost it with shb
[1:37:15] <%SomersaultJustice> astro was gutted a lot
[1:37:15] <XyraFhoan> ast lost time dilation
[1:37:17] <Byr0nX> Asscian lawl
[1:37:18] <Varrens> but when do AST's have mp anymore
[1:37:19] <ManfredA> all their buff extenders went away
[1:37:20] <moosemonkey397> AST has lightspeed still
[1:37:22] <%bluefooddye1> I tried to get into this, but holy shit do I not care about the story
[1:37:22] <OneThousandTomatoes> arachanist is kind of beast tamer
[1:37:24] <%shadowace2400> LB3 is the ultimate time spell
[1:37:24] <ManfredA> including dilation
[1:37:25] <%SomeSageAdvice> its mostly gone, with just space and star stuff left
[1:37:27] <+axenred> this cutscene cannot be skipped
[1:37:27] <+Remery_> does the discord have a ffxiv guild?
[1:37:28] <Cykron> THIS WAS NOT MY INTENTION WutFace
[1:37:28] <jimmypurple> Man look at this edgy fucken nerd standing on a mech like a nerd
[1:37:31] <%BunnyEmperor> same, SB AST was more fun
[1:37:31] <%VioletHeart> I adore new Astro. It's so much smoother.
[1:37:32] <%CrimsonDio11> thats what I figured but I was wondering if there was something else :/
[1:37:33] <JoshWithASpoon> Hey Pat, why didn't Square call SCH Tactician instead? Given their entire job questline, you'd think Tactician would be a more fitting name than Scholar.
[1:37:33] <+Grayhammatter> new AST kinda sucks
[1:37:35] <Veluren> New Astro makes me very sad
[1:37:35] <ManfredA> AST used to be gambler as a healer
[1:37:36] <ManfredA> now it sucks
[1:37:38] <Crimpson> Really? It's so much better
[1:37:39] <%pectusumbra> If I can't have timestop sex with a sin eater I'm not interested! /s
[1:37:42] <MrNoremac208> Astro now is fine
[1:37:42] <%thelaxinator> Lot of button bloat in Astro, and their tooltips are hard to read due to length
[1:37:42] <waddle_dee1992> @PatStaresAt Whats your opinion on our lord and saviour, the great Serpent?
[1:37:43] <%Broand> I never played old astro
[1:37:43] <+BIumen> he said it
[1:37:44] <DrillStopsNoCops> @bluefooddye1 It is impossible to care about ARR's story
[1:37:45] <%FutaSnek> monkaS ultima
[1:37:48] <KoyaMusa> personally i'm more curious about the next non limited dps, next limited prob beastmaster. figuring next dps is a caster
[1:37:50] <%MisterRockett> I'm trying to get it to 50 and it's hard keeping MP

[1:40:14] <+Grizzytron> "damn I thought the ULTIMATE MAGIC would be less powerful, shit"

[1:40:16] <%Capta1n_H3nry> WAIT IS THAT RAIDEN
[1:40:17] <JoshWithASpoon> Yo, after playing through the entire MSQ, you kinda learn that Lahabrea's a huge dick. Like, this man was unnecessarily destructive.
[1:40:18] <+lord_sykos> Because people hear it nearly EVERY DAY from running MSQ
[1:40:18] <waddle_dee1992> its weird how Gaius is voiced by a GoT actor after this ppoint
[1:40:19] <saraizarai> And you're cheating by bringing 7 friends
[1:40:20] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> Unlesh Ultima is better though
[1:40:20] <KoyaMusa> you're cheating with 7 other people?
[1:40:21] <%FutaSnek> YO DID THIS GUY VOICE HIDDIGER IN 7R?

[1:40:26] <%BunnyEmperor> Ultima Theme PogChamp
[1:40:27] <+CaptainJax> And you're cheating with crystal god
[1:40:28] <%dinnydanny777> Why does he still even want to fight you
[1:40:29] <%heartlesshealer> CANNOT BE SKIPPED
[1:40:29] <NJigglypuff> @PatStaresAt he is clearly not cheating, it doesnt even help level the playing field
[1:40:29] <+Story_Ark> oh shit it IS richard epcar
[1:40:30] <VanLynx> the WoL is alo cheating tho

[1:40:38] <%SirGO0SE> where my big bobot :(
[1:40:39] <Sydin18> @PatStaresAt can you explain that weird light thing?
[1:40:39] <%FutaSnek> IT sounds so close
[1:40:40] <trinityxlv> most of us can quote this entire dungeon from start to finish from memory
[1:40:41] <ManfredA> that was Bender
[1:40:41] <andrei11dr> Man Ahabrea ,you're the fucking shitest Aeon ,just fuck off
[1:40:44] <%FutaSnek> Ahhhh yeah
[1:40:46] <%Arxel1> Maybe you should have asked your crystal mom for a big robot too!
[1:40:46] <moosemonkey397> @PatStaresAt Hey if hydalen keeps getting exhausted, then why doesnt zodiark just win? he seems like a bitch
[1:40:46] <%dinnydanny777> Who voiced Ansem
[1:40:48] <+Remery_> Yo i just finished all those dumb Alexander dungeons \.
[1:40:48] <Cykron> I HAD NOT THOUGHT TO BE SO HARD PRESSED
[1:40:49] <%BunnyEmperor> one of the best songs
[1:40:49] <%gespenst25> the answer lies in the heat of battle
[1:40:50] <ManfredA> wait what
[1:40:53] <%HiroTSK5> DARK TIMES AHEAD
[1:40:53] <Ilpala> What? Heidegger was John DiMaggio wasn't it?
[1:40:54] <KnightAsteran> isnt that Ansem Seeker of Darkness?
[1:40:55] <%VioletHeart> Joseph Joestar in English.
[1:40:56] <ManfredA> that WASN'T DiMaggio?
[1:40:57] <TioXyco> Gaius's VA voiced Ziguratt 8, Ziggy, from Xenosaga
[1:41:00] <%spiritofmojave> Sí
[1:41:02] <%Evitron1> PAT BE CAREFUL
[1:41:03] <%dekkitout> Didn't Richard Epcar voice english dub Dio?
[1:41:04] <+ReckonZX> Is the green aura thing that was floating throughout the cutscene the Scholar's fairy?
[1:41:05] <%notgarza> THE voice of hulk?
[1:41:06] <JoshWithASpoon> However, Richard Epcar did do Ansem, seeker of Darkness in Kingdom Hearts.
[1:41:06] <%Cn_alpha_02> Whats that green fairy/light?
[1:41:06] <%BubbaRands> I dig Gi-ant Ro-bots
[1:41:07] <+uncannygale> Old Joseph Joestar
[1:41:07] <MrNoremac208> same guy voiced ansem
[1:41:07] <snowmanse> John DiMaggio
[1:41:09] <%Mendin> Didn'tt his guy voice Belze from Godhand
[1:41:11] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> ultimate ultima weapon is so damn hype when the new version of the music drops
[1:41:12] <%ragingbrachy> i thought it was john dimaggio
[1:41:12] <TioXyco> Gaius's VA from ARR, I mean
[1:41:15] <%cowardman93> John Dimmagio dude
[1:41:20] <%thelaxinator> people can die here, I've seen it happen
[1:41:28] <%YakumoYomi> Richard Epcar? Didn't he voice Batou in Ghost in the Shell SAC and Bobobo?
[1:41:32] <turtlegryphon> Is this a dungeon or something in this game? I've never played FF but I play WoW. Are you doing like a Molten Core type thing, if you know what that is?
[1:41:33] <$ashenfrenzy> at least we got UWU
[1:41:33] <%xemnahort> @knightasteran that was Billie motherfuckin Zane
[1:41:35] <Aeonknight_87> @PatStaresAt you can hear it in UWU <.<

[1:41:37] <Veluren> You get to hear remixes at least
[1:41:38] <zamzoph> @PatStaresAt is it used in the Ultima Weapon Trial?
[1:41:40] <%dinnydanny777> Yes, he voiced Ansem Seeker of Darkness with memorable lines such as "submit" "darkness" and "cum guardian"
[1:41:40] <olaksi> SingsNote bling SingsNote
[1:41:44] <+Remery_> Is it a mount?
[1:41:45] <+CaptainJax> At least Ruby has a good remix
[1:41:45] <+magusdraco> just do EX
[1:41:48] <zenith0111> That's why you do the Extreme Version
[1:41:50] <skyheys> it plays in other places
[1:41:50] <+Basilias_Maximus> There is with RUby Weapon
[1:41:50] <%Arxel1> You can hear it in the Trial LUL
[1:41:50] <+xeros720> you get to hear it if you do hard mode
[1:41:52] <JoshWithASpoon> You get to hear a SICK remix in Ruby Weapon though.
[1:41:54] <KoyaMusa> only if you get stuck with the minstrel version in mentor roulette :^)
[1:41:54] <%thelaxinator> A lot of Bosses in Praetorium deal un-telegraphed knockback attacks. If it was actually difficult it would be SUPER unfair

[1:43:32] <+linSP> how many breads
[1:43:33] <+metalsiren31> It's because there used to be a D icon at the end of his name

[1:43:35] <%ashenfrenzy> rip Gaius

[1:44:00] <snowmanse> Look at his name in the fight.
[1:44:00] <%valriot> He has the D letter after his name cos he was the D in the enemy list
[1:44:00] <%Mendin> If he casts slow on you, are you in the Lahabrea Tar Pits?
[1:44:04] <%spiritofmojave> PATHETIC
[1:44:06] <%Magick_Man> Lahabrea - D
[1:44:08] <%thelaxinator> Lahabrea D as in the 4th enemy
[1:44:10] <%ragingbrachy> thats way better
[1:44:12] <+fwfencer> he used to have a D icon at the end of his name, not sure why
[1:44:13] <ManfredA> he's Lahabread-D
[1:44:13] <+peekaytom> he's the fourth enemy to show up at that point
[1:44:13] <Aeonknight_87> It could be any letter. C, E, whatever
[1:44:13] <mikesapartment> the enemy list shows you a-z so it might be D
[1:44:14] <%plumlungs> PATHETIC
[1:44:14] <KoyaMusa> its the d aggro
[1:44:14] <%Metballs> Because different targets are lettered
[1:44:17] <KnightAsteran> @PatStaresAt also in Ultimate he is so easy he is a snack break time, thus Lahabread
[1:44:17] <saraizarai> enemies get letters added to them to differentiate
[1:44:18] <+Liliana_L> Lahabrea D
[1:44:19] <TheCoobie> He can be Enemy "D"
[1:44:19] <%Maids4lyfe> LMAO

[1:44:32] <+CaptainJax> Ifrit - A Titan - B Garuda - C Lahabrea - D
[1:44:33] <Ryutaryi> That's incredible
[1:44:33] <%spiritofmojave> LUL
[1:44:34] <inksmears> that's where the meme came from LUL

[1:45:09] <+Story_Ark> scions, more like...bye...gone
[1:45:09] <+ALazo> I'm not sure this stuff hasn't been retconned in some ways tbh
[1:45:12] <DrillStopsNoCops> The eldest and most powerful... of shitposts
[1:45:13] <ManfredA> this spiel is pretty relevant
[1:45:18] <%kindashagg> I could explain the whole plot but I will NOT
[1:45:20] <%tebari> The fact that Shadowbringers exists is kind of a spoiler
[1:45:23] <%thelaxinator> Foreshadowing to some future expansion no one cares about
[1:45:26] <%Starotter70> [C]hades
[1:45:29] <+JamminMage> honestly ive played shadowbringers and still barely understand what hes saying with all this fruity language
[1:45:32] <%gespenst25> I can't believe they-stuck the landing on this dumb villain speak
[1:45:32] <%Broand> Spongoilers
[1:45:32] <%Arxel1> Apparently the bad guys werent entirely wrong at all :P
[1:45:33] <skyheys> Lahabrea is a fucking chuuni
[1:45:34] <%TheShal> The greatest mind of his race
[1:45:35] <%ChaosAethr> so the meme came from Uwu?
[1:45:36] <andrei11dr> Getting to actually see the Asions was my favorite part of Shadow Bringers
[1:45:36] <zamzoph> so he has some good points?
[1:45:37] <%Chichen> retconned the past
[1:45:37] <%TheShal> Lahabread
[1:45:38] <%ragingbrachy> they kinda spoiled that at e3 didnt they?
[1:45:39] <%shadowace2400> they MADE it go somewhere
[1:45:41] <%BunnyEmperor> THE MOST POWERFUL OF PRIMALS
[1:45:45] <DrillStopsNoCops> The *P*resence of the *P*rimals
[1:45:47] <KoyaMusa> ah yes, the scholar
[1:45:49] <%spiritofmojave> Gaius was right basically
[1:45:53] <+JamminMage> hes basically monster mash
[1:45:53] <+peekaytom> all of the ascians are theatre kids
[1:46:02] <%TheShal> Gaius did nothing wrong
[1:46:02] <%Chichen> TIME TO BEAT UP THIS FUCK in 5 SECONDS
[1:46:05] <+CaptainJax> He lasts a good like 15 seconds, he tries
[1:46:07] <olaksi> Ascians were very shitty villains, until ShB where they became amazing out of nowhere
[1:46:08] <zenith0111> @jamminmage They expect you to have actually done all the side content for full context
[1:46:08] <ivanmistwalker> DARKNESS
[1:46:09] <%thelaxinator> get ready to kill him before his death trigger hits
[1:46:10] <moosemonkey397> i mean... hes orders of magnitude stronger than you in real form

[1:46:16] <%dinnydanny777> Is he becoming a heartless?
[1:46:19] <%plumlungs> i left that place alive about 2 hours ago tbhLurk
[1:46:20] <andrei11dr> Also his friend is on the moon
[1:46:21] <+Grizzytron> fraud detection alert
[1:46:23] <%MagicBeanBurrito> He's a victory lap
[1:46:25] <seaechiowai> look at this discount Sephiroth
[1:46:25] <xemeas> millions of players just curb stomping him every day
[1:46:27] <%SomersaultJustice> Aya Brea
[1:46:31] <+metalsiren31> You can literally just stand in his stupid puddles
[1:46:32] <%Arxel1> yes
[1:46:35] <+cawi> you can solo him basically
[1:46:35] <Crimpson> He has to go through his dialog
[1:46:37] <%thegreatbambe> someone isj just waiting for the door to open LUL

[1:47:30] <%Chichen> Kingdom hearts, but better writing
[1:47:30] <ricotez> that's the funniest part, there is a reason why he's weaker than the other two and it's because he's a fucking idiot
[1:47:31] <andrei11dr> Iea Hades was a much better fight than....this
[1:47:31] <%Daxalog> So you do that over and ovah again?

[1:47:52] <OneThousandTomatoes> but is it boring?
[1:47:53] <zenith0111> You're better off doing major leves than doing that roulette believe it or not
[1:48:02] <Crimpson> Spend your poetics peeps
[1:48:03] <+Grizzytron> @Daxalog You can only get the big EXP bonus for it once every day.

[1:50:00] <+Remery_> Does the discord have a ffxiv guild? Or is Pat's FC private?
[1:50:03] <%ragingbrachy> what were the things that you bought were
[1:50:10] <%Ranryu692> what is going on
[1:50:16] <%thelaxinator> If you have poetics to burn just buy Unidentifiable ore and trade it in for Grade 3 Thanalan soil. Best soil for gardening, sells well on the marketboard.
[1:50:23] <andrei11dr> That hat is wack as fuck
[1:50:26] <%TamsynRRD> Who's talking?!
[1:50:29] <Aeonknight_87> @ragingbrachy they were upgrade items to improve gear bought with Poetics tomes
[1:50:30] <KoyaMusa> pat didn't explain anything he did, but he used poetics to buy gear
[1:50:37] <Aeonknight_87> @ragingbrachy but he bought the wrong ones
[1:50:43] <+Story_Ark> I feel bad for my FC. Some drama kinda killed it :/
[1:50:44] <NJigglypuff> @PatStaresAt i love the hat its cute
[1:50:45] <+BIumen> binyot

[1:50:59] <%SomersaultJustice> all that retaining
[1:50:59] <%spiritofmojave> Binyot
[1:51:01] <zamzoph> you can also buy lvl50 gear
[1:51:11] <+Story_Ark> you can also use poetics in Mor Dona during ARR
[1:51:12] <Tomschiii> @story_ark thats kinda cool
[1:51:13] <ManfredA> I'd watch Vinyot play FFXIV
[1:51:17] <+xeros720> yeah, you need to trade them for a different version of the same gear that lets you dye them
[1:51:18] <+xeros720> i think
[1:51:19] <%heartlesshealer> That's not a santa hat????
[1:51:35] <%thelaxinator> @DrillStopsNoCops both the purchaser and the turn-in are in the idyllshire counter, the turn-in is to the right of the purchase. Ore is under "Special Arms"
[1:51:35] <%ChaosAethr> did you get your lv80 relic weapons?
[1:51:40] <@StridentSong> Heavensward are also useless for XP
[1:51:42] <%luftraumm1> vinny would HATE this

[1:51:48] <bahamut1010> leahH5L leahH5R
[1:51:49] <penitentpentwitch> ARR are mostly for unlocking the Dyes they sell
[1:51:50] <%spiritofmojave> The Kobold's have a neat brown dye if nothing else
[1:51:54] <+Story_Ark> only thing is that ARR doesnt really have too many uses for poetics besides gear.
[1:51:55] <%ragingbrachy> Kreygasm
[1:51:57] <+Grayhammatter> the ananta

[1:53:06] <KoyaMusa> beast tribe quests also scale for level based on area they're at, and you only get 3 a day per area

[1:53:21] <NeonBleu> Dumbo's cousin
[1:53:21] <%spiritofmojave> because fuck you
[1:53:22] <@SSaryn> Fuck you, if Chcobos can fly, so can Elephants and Tigers and shit
[1:53:23] <%ChaosAethr> magic
[1:53:23] <%Jekado> is that a dumbo reference?
[1:53:24] <+peekaytom> when in doubt, cloudsbreath
[1:53:25] <ToBais91> why does behemoth fly? Kappa
[1:53:26] <%xemnahort> Don’t you dare read them
[1:53:28] <superchronicc> its the psychic tandum war elephant
[1:53:29] <Azathotic> Fart gas
[1:53:30] <%Pukenasty> its dumbo without the racist crows
[1:53:31] <+Grayhammatter> the same reason why a goddamn jar jar binks flies in this game
[1:53:32] <DrillStopsNoCops> @DefaultSettiings LUL
[1:53:32] <Byr0nX> he beeg
[1:53:33] <%maenos2> they could at least flap its ears
[1:53:33] <ScarletPrime> Ya'll want to talk about the flying T-Rex from Eureka then?
[1:53:38] <+Ilpala> Get the flying turtle out!!
[1:53:38] <OneThousandTomatoes> yip yip
[1:53:39] <%ragingbrachy> SourPls
[1:53:39] <shiibbae> aether magic???
[1:53:39] <%YakumoYomi> I dun seen about everything...but I AIN'T NEVER SEEN NO ELEPHANT FLY
[1:53:39] <+kuervojones> That elephant is flying, that is not the normal order of things
[1:53:40] <@SoFarFetched> @SSaryn I don't see you flying,but you're probably too stumbo sipsipDab
[1:53:42] <shiibbae> aether wind magic??
[1:53:44] <Aeonknight_87> @zenith0111 they also take 10 leve tokens. it's actually more XP per leve token to do the small ones
[1:53:48] <andrei11dr> cuz magic
[1:53:51] <%spiritofmojave> I love the flying animation for this and Behemoth LUL
[1:53:52] <Wan6Saber> What's better, kek or lol?
[1:53:52] <%arcielardor> FUCK IT. FLYING ELEPHANT
[1:53:57] <%spiritofmojave> it's so goddamn dumb
[1:53:57] <%Starotter70> ANTS
[1:53:57] <+Remery_> Cute mount, i want it
[1:54:04] <@SSaryn> @SoFarFetched AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
[1:54:05] <TioXyco> ants that a problem?
[1:54:05] <zenith0111> @aeonknight_87 Small ones don't use tokens....
[1:54:07] <%YakumoYomi> @SoFarFetched Nailed it. psaSmug
[1:54:08] <%spiritofmojave> ANTS!
[1:54:11] <+gaemjurnalist> flying goobue is best mount
[1:54:16] <%ragingbrachy> can you get an elephant mount like that guy ?
[1:54:30] <ConBruhh> Ixal are great tho
[1:54:35] <+gnoame> Yeah if you max out their rep you can buy that mount
[1:54:38] <+Remery_> But some have mount unlocks at the end
[1:54:41] <KoyaMusa> yes pat, you still get 900k from these at 70+?
[1:54:41] <%AquilaHarukaze> I'm literally only doing the HW beast tribes because I wanna see the alliance quest.
[1:54:43] <+Grayhammatter> fae tribe gives so much
[1:54:44] <TioXyco> @ragingbrachy you can get the elephant mount, yes
[1:54:53] <%ragingbrachy> hell yeah
[1:54:57] <@SoFarFetched> I should actually wash my bedsheets soon
[1:54:57] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> yes @ragingbrachy you can buy it from the beast tribe once you reach a certain rank
[1:54:58] <%briktal> it's very dirty
[1:55:04] <+fenix122> Only do ARR or HW quests if you want glamour stuff or mounts. THat's about it.
[1:55:05] <+gnoame> the flying Dandelion is the best
[1:55:06] <%gespenst25> what did they shit on it?
[1:55:08] <Ner234> Riveting Gameplay
[1:55:10] <Aeonknight_87> @zenith0111 guess they changed that. it used to cost tokens
[1:55:11] <$Caped_Eggy> What are they doing on that bed?
[1:55:15] <%Ranryu692> absolutely deserving of the Warrior of Light
[1:55:15] <OneThousandTomatoes> very high level quest
[1:55:16] <@SoFarFetched> Pat shat on it for them
[1:55:17] <Crimpson> Gotta get those "stains" out of it
[1:55:19] <+linSP> this is my kinda game
[1:55:20] <@SoFarFetched> as a favor
[1:55:29] <TioXyco> @fenix122 ARR ones sell low level craft materials AND some dyes too
[1:55:29] <Byr0nX> laid eggs on it
[1:55:31] <%Tyndarian> wiping didn't help any
[1:55:35] <%damienlunas> It's really hard to wash all that snake jizz out of the bedsheets
[1:55:40] <Aeonknight_87> @zenith0111 wait that's a lie, they absolutely still cost leve tokens
[1:55:41] <saraizarai> Truly a quest worthy of Nidhogg and Ultima slayer
[1:55:42] <%spiritofmojave> I always thought it was panning for gold or something
[1:55:50] <OneThousandTomatoes> They don't have toilet paper do they?
[1:55:58] <ToBais91> these tips for alt jobs mainly or for first time players? just got here sorry
[1:56:01] <+Dangasmic> thats just a crocodile
[1:56:04] <JoshWithASpoon> Chocobros for life.
[1:56:07] <%Shady_Squid> What's your chocobo's name?
[1:56:07] <$metzselaar> Anyone here on Famfrit? Looking to add folks to chat with in game.
[1:56:09] <+Finaldragoon> more like Chocobro
[1:56:13] <Wan6Saber> hope you're okay playing solo, all day
[1:56:14] <%ShawnTK_> @tobais91 alt
[1:56:16] <@SoFarFetched> As they once said in the Castlevania TV Show: "What the fuck is toilet paper??"
[1:56:23] <ToBais91> thanks
[1:56:25] <Aydarkzero> @Dangasmic Fantasy Crocodile!
[1:56:25] <+peekaytom> 1-2-3 star hunt marks are nice to do for exp too
[1:56:25] <+datmegamandeeeee> I imagine a snek gorl could open some kinky possibilities 😏
[1:56:28] <+linSP> did that quest say butt buddies
[1:56:31] <%ragingbrachy> i dont even remember what server im on
[1:56:31] <KoyaMusa> pat tell them about challenge log for player exp
[1:56:32] <+gustavozxd> KILL KILL KILL
[1:56:37] <ColRedyx> And feed it Curiel Roots while it's out. Gives the chocobo an exp buff.
[1:56:37] <Azathotic> @PatStaresAt Nope, FATE grinding in ShB also helps
[1:56:38] <CyborgAV> Does the Blue Mage trick now worry anymore?
[1:56:42] <zenith0111> @aeonknight_87 I'm honestly confused because I'm getting 2 mil a leve rotation... is that bad?
[1:56:42] <+cawi> dont they level in stables?
[1:56:43] <CyborgAV> not*
[1:56:44] <@SSaryn> Chocobo level is stupid anyway
[1:56:44] <%BunnyEmperor> it doesnt take that long if you do the weekly challenges
[1:56:48] <andrei11dr> Gotta love Stormblood and it's 50 desserts
[1:56:49] <Crimpson> I didn't bother leveling mine.
[1:56:50] <CookieCatte> do it as a Blue Mage, they get massive XP bonus which translates to chocobo's
[1:56:50] <+Its_HK> mfw I hit 80 and never opened my hunting log once :)
[1:56:51] <%dinnydanny777> Can a Chocobo die
[1:56:52] <CyborgAV> work*
[1:56:56] <JoshWithASpoon> My Chocobro's only level 7 LuL
[1:56:56] <+crazyspartan214> 17 of 20 what!?!?!
[1:57:03] <moosemonkey397> mines at 9 :(
[1:57:13] <Azathotic> @dinnydanny777 Yes, but you can just resummon them back from hell
[1:57:14] <TioXyco> @crazyspartan214 17/20 levels
[1:57:15] <penitentpentwitch> Something else to due while Queueing
[1:57:15] <+gustavozxd> waiting for dps queues
[1:57:16] <%animaturgy> Map groups are pretty good for them too
[1:57:21] <zenith0111> @aeonknight_87 I'm a month new to this game and I have a lvl 75 Red Mage before Heavensward. Is that slow?
[1:57:22] <%prof_warlock> @PatStaresAt what about running palace of the dead?
[1:57:23] <ColRedyx> @cawi Yeah they do, but it's slower than summoning them and fighting stuff. You should stable it and feed it before you sign off though.
[1:57:24] <zamzoph> Did someone say Fate? Kappa
[1:57:26] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> you can feed them EXP in the stables
[1:57:27] <%gespenst25> the challenge log for fates is pretty good, like 3 million for the two
[1:57:27] <Aeonknight_87> @zenith0111 it's not bad, but the small leves doing them 10 times will give more than 2 mil xp. but that takes time so if you dont care for the less xp efficiency by all means go nuts
[1:57:34] <OneThousandTomatoes> when I was playing the free demo I would use the hunter log to level, I'm guessing that wasn't very efficient
[1:57:43] <OneThousandTomatoes> for alts
[1:57:49] <%spiritofmojave> fully leveling the shared fates level can be helpful for getting the orchestrions/some materials for crafting
[1:57:51] <+cawi> @ColRedyx thanks for the quick reply. I forget to do that
[1:57:56] <$Dakuu75> holy shit, there's lamia npc?
[1:57:57] <%spiritofmojave> otherwise it's kinda eh
[1:58:02] <+Kelldav> @OneThousandTomatoes its efficient if ur in q and low lvl
[1:58:04] <+xeros720> do your leves pat
[1:58:04] <+Grayhammatter> EZ
[1:58:05] <DrillStopsNoCops> @OneThousandTomatoes It's good for getting you to lvl 15
[1:58:07] <Crimpson> @OneThousandTomatoes It helps at lower lvls
[1:58:10] <%briktal> they also didn't add any battle leves after hw
[1:58:11] <@StridentSong> There's also no Battle Leves after Heavenward
[1:58:14] <%bluefooddye1> Sometimes the fastest and easiest way isn't the best
[1:58:15] <%SpcOpsBear> There are NO LEVES past level 58.
[1:58:16] <+fenix122> Plus, after level 50 they stop offering levels for combat classes altogether.
[1:58:20] <+gustavozxd> @onethousandtomatoes it's efficient until you hit 15, then it's not
[1:58:25] <zenith0111> But leves can be done in like 1 minute. So how fast is this?
[1:58:28] <+TheSpartanThief> Also from Stormblood onwards.....unless it's Gatherer/Crafter, YOU CAN'T LEVE.
[1:58:32] <+xeros720> seriously? that's kind of interesting
[1:58:32] <+Grayhammatter> yeyeyeyeye faeries
[1:58:34] <%thelaxinator> Leves can be used for triple-turn-in money. It's boring as piss but it's good, reliable money. Honest Gillionaire was more profitable than I thought it would be.
[1:58:34] <OneThousandTomatoes> thats pretty much what I used it for so ok
[1:58:39] <zenith0111> Like a 30 sec difference?
[1:58:42] <%spiritofmojave> Fae are amazing
[1:58:44] <saraizarai> Combat leves don't really exist past ARR
[1:58:46] <brian_peppers1> wow how exciting NUMBERS GO UP!
[1:58:54] <JoshWithASpoon> Man, I should really do Beast Tribes, huh?
[1:58:56] <%spiritofmojave> BIG number up
[1:58:58] <Crimpson> Leves are useless
[1:58:58] <%TheSpartanThief> TheSpartanThief subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[1:59:01] <%SpcOpsBear> But Pat, Shadowbringers side quests are level sync'd anyway
[1:59:04] <%TheShal> They did
[1:59:04] <@SSaryn> These Thiccsies are very good for many things Kappa
[1:59:04] <DrillStopsNoCops> 1mil xp per BTW
[1:59:06] <+Grayhammatter> dwarves
[1:59:08] <DrillStopsNoCops> *BTQ
[1:59:08] <+andrewoid_> they did, dwarves are gonna be crafting
[1:59:09] <+peekaytom> fairly certain they said dwarves
[1:59:09] <%VioletHeart> yes they have, Pat. It's dwarves.
[1:59:09] <%briktal> isn't it crafting?
[1:59:09] <%Metballs> They have, it's Dwarves
[1:59:10] <%Dwarven_Gaming> its TOTOALLY dwarves
[1:59:11] <%TheShal> Next beast tribe is Dwarves for Crafting
[1:59:11] <CyborgAV> Yes they have, it's Dwarves
[1:59:12] <penitentpentwitch> Dwarves, Crafting
[1:59:12] <@StridentSong> They did, they said it's the Dwarves
[1:59:13] <+Story_Ark> How many beast tribes are in the expansions?
[1:59:13] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> its the dwarves, its a crafting tribe
[1:59:13] <+xeros720> there's always 3 tribes right?
[1:59:13] <KoyaMusa> @PatStaresAt there isn't going to be another battle tribe
[1:59:14] <+Grayhammatter> it's gonna be dwarves
[1:59:14] <zamzoph> It's free xp
[1:59:14] <ColRedyx> Didn't they confirm it was Dwarves for crafting?
[1:59:15] <%Blackjack760> dwarves
[1:59:16] <zenith0111> @crimpson Guess you don't use materia either
[1:59:17] <+fenix122> I think they said it was going to be Dwarves, and crafting focused.
[1:59:18] <+Mr_Quail> they told us dwarves
[1:59:18] <+datmegamandeeeee> Having a leveled chocobo may be useless. But if you’re doing an expansion, or story content, a healer chocobro may save your life
[1:59:18] <ricotez> they doubled the amount of XP that the fairies give because they want to add only one battle tribe
[1:59:19] <%Shady_Squid> fairy quests why you so free?
[1:59:19] <moosemonkey397> i hope the dwarves are crafting
[1:59:19] <+Remery_> more cute girl tribes
[1:59:20] <+Finaldragoon> yes it is, it's Dwarves for crafting
[1:59:21] <olaksi> Also the quest is great
[1:59:21] <Crimpson> They only put Leves into the game because it was in the 1.0
[1:59:23] <%Starotter70> Can you play sick jams?
[1:59:23] <%spiritofmojave> Dwarves ye
[1:59:24] <TioXyco> yes
[1:59:27] <%GelatinBoi> psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead it's dwarves
[1:59:28] <ricotez> that's why the fairies give so much
[1:59:30] <%Dwarven_Gaming> WE GET A TANK
[1:59:31] <ScarletPrime> They said in the Letter from the Producer at one point that Fairys are the only Combat Tribe for ShB. That is why they give so much EXP compared to the past.
[1:59:32] <%Blackjack760> crafting dwarves
[1:59:34] <TioXyco> Crafter Dwarves, confirmed
[1:59:35] <+crazyspartan214> yup
[1:59:36] <%Dwarven_Gaming> For the beastribe
[1:59:38] <DrillStopsNoCops> wait is there a beast tribe in raktika?
[1:59:40] <%Cn_alpha_02> Dwarves for crafters.
[1:59:43] <%Overlordkain> lalafel confirmed beast race then
[1:59:43] <%thelaxinator> News Flash: Lalafel are apparently beastmen.
[1:59:44] <%spiritofmojave> Maybe the Nou Mu
[1:59:48] <%briktal> @Crimpson more like because leves WERE 1.0
[1:59:49] <%ragingbrachy> 💩
[1:59:49] <+fenix122> Paissa?
[1:59:50] <+peekaytom> Phooka
[1:59:50] <%pectusumbra> pooka?
[1:59:52] <@SSaryn> The Paissa?
[1:59:52] <%Valdorick> wait what?
[1:59:52] <%walternatorz> pukka?
[1:59:54] <TioXyco> Pooka
[1:59:57] <%gespenst25> paissa?
[1:59:57] <spiritofmojave> Phooka
[2:00:00] <OneThousandTomatoes> polka?
[2:00:02] <%SomersaultJustice> big pig snorts
[2:00:04] <+peekaytom> they're Phooka on the first
[2:00:04] <%thelaxinator> they are called phooka here
[2:00:05] <+crazyspartan214> flirt a fariy
[2:00:06] <olaksi> Lalas finally demoted to a beast race
[2:00:06] <KoyaMusa> they're called phooka in norvrandt
[2:00:07] <%heartlesshealer> I would LOVE to see Nu Mou
[2:00:08] <+Grayhammatter> they are phooka i think?
[2:00:08] <+xeros720> poop on the polka, got it
[2:00:09] <%Metballs> These ones are phhokas
[2:00:10] <+datmegamandeeeee> Fairy quests are in fact the easiest bt
[2:00:13] <zamzoph> jump n' shoot
[2:00:16] <ToBais91> apply dots, hit procs?
[2:00:16] <%spiritofmojave> Polka
[2:00:21] <+fenix122> Sing and shoot people with the pointy end of the stick, I think.
[2:00:23] <%rumtumtugnutz> go poop on the polka
[2:00:23] <+the22cstomp> use song, put on dots, spam same move over and over
[2:00:23] <%thelaxinator> Bard's DPS rotation is... not intuitive
[2:00:25] <OneThousandTomatoes> just olay real music
[2:00:25] <TioXyco> crit > dot > song > other dot
[2:00:27] <+Grayhammatter> jump and shoot man
[2:00:27] <%Mendin> Do the quiquirin have a beast tribe quest network?
[2:00:28] <%a_c_chirns> dance like an asshole in a city
[2:00:30] <%Mendin> I like the memeroons
[2:00:33] <Crimpson> @zenith0111 Oh I do. I get mine from doing dungeons at need certain classes and the currency used for hunts
[2:00:35] <+datmegamandeeeee> My paissa is tingling
[2:00:37] <%spiritofmojave> BRD is boring who caaaares
[2:00:39] <%ragingbrachy> die :)
[2:00:46] <+xeros720> pat demonstrating why some people are so bad at playing their class
[2:00:47] <%Haxfromhell> Haxfromhell subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[2:00:49] <+crazyspartan214> die
[2:00:50] <%r0chelimit> r0chelimit subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 16 months, currently on a 16 month streak! Couldn’t think of anything funny to say so pet the baby.
[2:00:55] <%thelaxinator> Remember when Bard had it's support skills completely removed and replaced with self-buffs?
[2:00:55] <+Remery_> The "Shake your ass" class
[2:00:58] <olaksi> Bard should have been separate from ranger
[2:00:59] <zenith0111> @crimpson What?
[2:00:59] <ToBais91> whats with the bard hate?
[2:00:59] <%rumtumtugnutz> Thanks for the PrideLion @r0chelimit
[2:01:01] <+gaemjurnalist> BRD is okay but MCH is best ranged
[2:01:06] <%heartlesshealer> Hope it's actual dwarves and not just Lilties from Crystal Chronicles
[2:01:10] <%SomeSageAdvice> there is a fate/quest pun called "What the phooka" in Il Mheg
[2:01:14] <OneThousandTomatoes> I remember you could play real music with bard, so I learned how to play hot cross buns
[2:01:16] <Aydarkzero> but my number is high!
[2:01:17] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> READ YOUR TOOLTIPS PEOPLE
[2:01:23] <+gustavozxd> atpRtsd atpRtsd atpRtsd
[2:01:27] <+Remery_> But you get tutorials
[2:01:27] <JoshWithASpoon> Or you get people who boost jobs.
[2:01:32] <KoyaMusa> its the dwarves in kholusia, we already know what they're like
[2:01:33] <Byr0nX> you know fighting
[2:01:33] <zamzoph> nobody will notice if you're DPS Kappa
[2:01:34] <+datmegamandeeeee> Brd got nerfed so mch could shine. Last expansion was the inverse
[2:01:36] <%briktal> rotations are for tires
[2:01:39] <zenith0111> Ye FF14 is kinda filled with casuals....
[2:01:41] <+gnoame> I ain't reading shit, I'm rolling my face on my keyboard like I alwayshave
[2:01:41] <%pectusumbra> Man if we actually get crystal chronicles stuff in this after the remaster drops I will actually have to think of playing this game
[2:01:42] <ColRedyx> @Remery_ Not for the jobs.
[2:01:42] <%Arxel1> NAaaah, I'm just gonna play the class. YOU DONT PAY MY SUB
[2:01:47] <%Gogogolem> Or do what i do and only play warrior.
[2:01:48] <%spiritofmojave> watch a video or two if you gotta
[2:01:58] <+peekaytom> wish the balance discord didn't support the bot made by a transphobe but shrug
[2:01:58] <ColRedyx> You get tooltips but people *don't read them.*
[2:01:59] <%PhantomMiG> @patstaresat Should you lv your crafting class at the same rate as your battle class
[2:02:03] <+Remery_> @ColRedyx oh ok
[2:02:05] <coffeethat> u dont pay my sub
[2:02:14] <%Valdorick> "What's a rotation? I just spam Ice 3"
[2:02:15] <%ragingbrachy> funny 4Head
[2:02:16] <+Remery_> WAR tooltips?
[2:02:18] <ivanmistwalker> will they ever increase the level cap in updates?
[2:02:19] <%rumtumtugnutz> I play Drg main so I know I'm doing it right if I'm on the floor
[2:02:19] <%Metballs> Just carry your grey parsing static through E8S like a champ
[2:02:23] <%thelaxinator> funny, not informative sadly
[2:02:23] <%SpcOpsBear> Desperius has some good class guides too
[2:02:24] <%BunnyEmperor> not really
[2:02:25] <saraizarai> It's better than castrum
[2:02:25] <Crimpson> @zenith0111 You said I didn't use materia so I was correcting you that I do
[2:02:25] <%thegreatbambe> Are you gonna give me the $15 for doing that?
[2:02:26] <+Story_Ark> honestly its so easy to learn your class. just play it and read what skills do.
[2:02:29] <XyraFhoan> this game's super generous about buffering skills before they finish casting so you can use that to your advantage
[2:02:30] <%SpcOpsBear> He also gets into how to meld your shit
[2:02:31] <%heartlesshealer> that bar e jumpin'
[2:02:32] <%Starotter70> Well now
[2:02:32] <madskull456> but i only want to dps as healer
[2:02:35] <%TheSpartanThief> @Remery_ Always Be Cleaving
[2:02:35] <JoshWithASpoon> Or sit there and read you tool tips and beat the fuck out of a training dummy like I did with BLM LuL
[2:02:42] <%briktal> or just play a healer, they have easy rotations
[2:02:44] <+gnoame> Someone has to tank the floor
[2:02:49] <zenith0111> @peekaytom Wait are people supporting botting in this game?
[2:02:50] <DrillStopsNoCops> Watch WeskAlber's videos, he goes through rotations as you level
[2:02:51] <skyheys> Fairy quests give you 1/6 of a level at 79. shit is insane
[2:02:51] <OneThousandTomatoes> how do you spell the name of the channel?
[2:02:56] <%goatbait> so what if you don't have access to that part of the game?
[2:02:58] <+Remery_> @TheSpartanThief okie dokie

[2:06:24] <%apolitenoob> I can’t believe you’re the reason I keep getting these raids in the roulette rather than ANY OF THE OTHER ONES
[2:06:26] <%ashenfrenzy> It literally ruins the point of Roulettes
[2:06:27] <+the22cstomp> it's extremely BM and ruins people trying to get queues for newer raids
[2:06:28] <+fenix122> I mean, thanks to people like this, you're probably going to run CT or LotA *anyway*....
[2:06:32] <Byr0nX> you're lying to the group lol
[2:06:41] <zenith0111> Oh god is this why I have like no one to fucking play with during extreme trials and higher raids? Because people are actually ducking the other quests??? NotLikeThis I might just quit again lol
[2:06:45] <%thegreatbambe> Hey thats me
[2:06:49] <%spiritofmojave> The idea is you get a varied experience if you're level 60 or above
[2:06:53] <KoyaMusa> cause pat plays on na and they can't do orbonne
[2:07:06] <Aeonknight_87> @zenith0111 do not use the Duty Finder for extreme trials and raids
[2:07:06] <zamzoph> that does kinda suck
[2:07:08] <%xWanderingFlame> psaUp
[2:07:08] <+the22cstomp> NA skillbase is really bad so people cheese it
[2:07:10] <NJigglypuff> SourPls
[2:07:13] <+metalsiren31> Tell that to me getting Orbonne 5 times in a row last month
[2:07:13] <Ryutaryi> This is why Ivalice queues take me multiple HOURS
[2:07:14] <%BunnyEmperor> they should add lvl 70/80 Alliance Raid roulette
[2:07:15] <Aeonknight_87> @zenith0111 set up a Party Finder
[2:07:20] <ricotez> you don't have anyone to play with in Extreme trials because nobody uses the duty finder to queue up for those
[2:07:21] <%Blackjack760> PEIPLE SUCK
[2:07:22] <zenith0111> @aeonknight_87 Party Finder has been rough....
[2:07:23] <+crazyspartan214> THIS EXPLAIN WHY i ALWAYS GET CRYSTAL!!!
[2:07:23] <%thegreatbambe> huh
[2:07:26] <+Story_Ark> Oooh i see, youre guaranteeing a dungeon
[2:07:28] <%gespenst25> it might also be an exploit

[2:07:31] <+killer_squid1990> MATH BOSS
[2:07:32] <KoyaMusa> oh god remember that orbonne stream you did it was so bad

[2:07:49] <%spiritofmojave> I had a horrible Riddonah run last night with primes
[2:07:51] <Aeonknight_87> @zenith0111 yeah.... depending on the content, older stuff you're gonna be waiting awhile if you dont get friends to come with. or you can undersize it
[2:07:51] <AsiSed> They even nerfed Orbonne and there are still people who can't clear it.
[2:08:01] <%Blackjack760> THUNDER GOD AND MATH
[2:08:08] <youucherwatt> you make the game worse so you can get through it faster
[2:08:12] <ColRedyx> Yeah, it's tragic what they did to Cid
[2:08:13] <+superdoomshroom> God I remember when Orbonne monastery came out and no one could do it

[2:08:38] <Vakojin> You want roulette to be fast, not a chore
[2:08:39] <moosemonkey397> yeah orbonne is real regardless
[2:08:40] <%spiritofmojave> Those fucking bubble placements no one knows how to place them in a pocket
[2:08:40] <Jdrockefeller> but mechanics have not changed. You have to educate the alliance
[2:08:42] <Azathotic> Pat is just unlucky
[2:08:45] <xemeas> old oreborn was fine , people just bad
[2:08:51] <gatoralus> yeah pat i'm over here just trying to run copied factory cmon bruh
[2:08:53] <ColRedyx> I will never understand how wasting 2 hours of your life for nothing is preferable to spend 10 minutes of effort learning.
[2:08:54] <Jdrockefeller> I like doing all of them
[2:08:55] <luishGO> i hate the new Orbonne NotLikeThis
[2:08:58] <+Remery_> Does it matter who's main tank in these huge raids?
[2:08:58] <SomeOtherNeb> and then it turned otu none of us appreciate this
[2:08:59] <%ashenfrenzy> we dont need more people doing this
[2:09:03] <Aeonknight_87> @zenith0111 it has it's peaks and valleys. right now we're in a content drought, most groups have cleared the raid tier. etc. it's a slow period
[2:09:03] <%AquilaHarukaze> it was SO COOL!
[2:09:05] <%FutaSnek> LUL so much salt
[2:09:05] <skyheys> I unappreciated you telling people to do this
[2:09:05] <%BunnyEmperor> some people find it difficult to stand in a circle like everyone else is doing it
[2:09:08] <%Blackjack760> thanks for ruining all of us
[2:09:10] <Lorenz_Attractor> I appreciate it. I love being a scum

[2:09:14] <SomeOtherNeb> LUL
[2:09:15] <DrillStopsNoCops> I appreciate the tech as much as I appreciate stepping in dog doo or falling into the toilet.
[2:09:18] <@SSaryn> I give people shit for it, but also I don't blame anyone for it.
[2:09:19] <Jdrockefeller> I like gettin crystal tower series least of all just cause how much it comes up
[2:09:20] <mikesapartment> who is "we"? it's stupid that they don't give more exp for the longer ones
[2:09:22] <$Dakuu75> <3
[2:09:24] <brian_peppers1> Fuck you Pat
[2:09:25] <%Blackjack760> I have done Labrynth 20 times in a row 20!
[2:09:26] <TioXyco> people dislike because it's the msot common alliances you get
[2:09:27] <%FutaSnek> GAINS OVER MORALS
[2:09:28] <ricotez> I remember one very bad run of Orbonne where we just kept wiping to TG until a bunch of players got so frustrated they left
[2:09:31] <%FutaSnek> GET ON MY LVL
[2:09:31] <+the22cstomp> this is bad etiquette for new players trying to do newer raids
[2:09:32] <ricotez> turns out they were the bad ones
[2:09:32] <%Arxel1> Gotta get that number up FAST
[2:09:33] <+crazyspartan214> damn it Pat!!!!!!
[2:09:35] <%SirGO0SE> pat is training us to be the best :)
[2:09:35] <%Dwarven_Gaming> PAT = SMURF
[2:09:36] <KeiPrime> big number
[2:09:36] <ricotez> bc the replacements could do TG just fine
[2:09:38] <%BunnyEmperor> no Pat, people need to do the harder raids and learn the game
[2:09:40] <clockworknate> pat looks shamed now lol
[2:09:42] <zenith0111> @aeonknight_87 Actually I can see the player percentages for things the player base has accomplished.... it's pretty sad tbh.
[2:09:45] <Vyskus> oh hell yeah, labyrinth of the ancients
[2:09:45] <DrillStopsNoCops> Labrynth is boring as all unholy sin.
[2:09:50] <Ubu2933> yay for schrodinger's internet is it working or isn't it I never know till I turn my pc on, yay for rural internet
[2:09:50] <%Enemy_In_Disguise> Scumbag Pat's top ways to ruin the game psaUp
[2:09:51] <Veluren> I would rather have something slower and more varied instead of the fastest thing 20 days in a row, that's my opinion on it
[2:09:57] <%spiritofmojave> Well there's definitely less risk involved with this, Lab, at the very least. Much as I LOATHE stripping to reduce i-level
[2:10:05] <Aeonknight_87> @zenith0111 yeah it fuckin is lol. most players are trash
[2:10:08] <%SirGO0SE> it does seem odd that you cant just pick what you want to queue for
[2:10:15] <zenith0111> @aeonknight_87 Not even 1/4 the player base equips materia and in fact actively refuse to equip them
[2:10:16] <%Valdorick> Just have the game check the bag for items you could be wearing as your current class.
[2:10:17] <penitentpentwitch> I have literally leveled an alt that has unlocked every raid EXCEPT the 'Crystal Tower' raids because of how sick I am of people doing this
[2:10:17] <+crazyspartan214> These new player need to learn the new raid and get good
[2:10:20] <Strongfish91> I've gottan paired with alliances that just cannot get past the very first boss of Dun Scaith
[2:10:21] <%twoto858> twoto858 is continuing the Gift Sub they got from Kouseo! 
[2:10:28] <%FutaSnek> I love how mad people are over something optional LUL
[2:10:29] <XyraFhoan> Orbonne has a lot of ways for one person to make their whole party miserable due to the way some of the mechanics work, but I'd rather do newer raids over Labyrinth because Labyrinth is full of the saltiest cry babies
[2:10:31] <KoyaMusa> oh my god i saw a post of someone with a lvl 1 scholar book and it was actually impossible
[2:10:42] <%xWanderingFlame> psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead
[2:10:48] <zenith0111> @aeonknight_87 The integrity of the playerbase is what irks me. Pretty chill people but no commitment

[2:11:05] <KeiPrime> it isnt already?
[2:11:06] <%walternatorz> guess you just delete the alt
[2:11:07] <+the22cstomp> @FutaSnek it kills queue times for players trying to do new raids it's awful etiquette

[2:11:11] <+LiberatedPhoenix> Do you have tips for someone trying to first time level up the Healing classes? Best route?
[2:11:12] <%AquilaHarukaze> If you're already in SB it should be fine
[2:11:12] <%ashenfrenzy> @SirGO0SE Roulettes exist so that people who queue for specific things can get people filled into the party via the Roulette.
[2:11:12] <DrillStopsNoCops> @SirGO0SE You CAN pick which ones youi wanna do, but you don't get the roulette bonus
[2:11:13] <Aeonknight_87> @zenith0111 it's because the game does not do a good job of enforcing skill levels on casual players. there is no "gatekeeping" to content, so players do it themselves
[2:11:14] <%spiritofmojave> rip that extra money for an alt
[2:11:14] <%Shady_Squid> That kinda sucks. I liked feeling special cause i'd done it.
[2:11:15] <ToBais91> damn, glad i got throught that slog already
[2:11:15] <%optimasmaximas> sup guys
[2:11:17] <+crazyspartan214> LUL
[2:11:17] <%apolitenoob> LUL LUL
[2:11:18] <%Enemy_In_Disguise> wait I never did Crystal Tower. Fuck
[2:11:18] <skyheys> @futasnek people are more mad because it means optional content never
[2:11:20] <%Broand> oh is this that weird crystal tower thing
[2:11:21] <%AquilaHarukaze> So just get your foot in the door before it shuts
[2:11:24] <NJigglypuff> this song is so good and its used for trash pulls :(
[2:11:30] <Aeonknight_87> @zenith0111 but it doesn't incentivize it by much either. you're either in it for the challenge or not at all
[2:11:38] <%FutaSnek> @the22cstomp Yeah but people don't have to do the exploit, he was just showing how
[2:11:39] <XyraFhoan> my husband never unlocked Crystal Tower because the requirement to unlock it used to be ridiculous with 4 slow spawning FATEs, I think even though they changed it he's never gonna come back to play with me
[2:11:40] <%spiritofmojave> so if they did the main story before hand to its fullest
[2:11:42] <JoshWithASpoon> Crystal Tower, like the rest of the Alliance raids, isn't mandatory. It will be once 5.3 rolls around.
[2:11:42] <SomeOtherNeb> crossbow is the shit
[2:11:42] <+Story_Ark> So does this actually make the dungeon less fun or worse to play?
[2:11:47] <%SirGO0SE> @ashenfrenzy @DrillStopsNoCops ah! I see. I was forgetting the bonus
[2:11:49] <+Basilias_Maximus> Are they gonna fix the shitty grind needed to unlock Crystal Tower?
[2:11:51] <xemeas> ive never done crystal tower, this is the first time im seeing this and i have multiple 80 lvl jobs
[2:11:53] <%FutaSnek> @skyheys I get that
[2:11:53] <%SinisterBroccoli> I just don't like doing early raids cuz I don't like not having abilities
[2:11:54] <Who_lio42> I just unlocked Machinist, whats it like
[2:11:56] <+DecadeQuartzer> This is why hard content would be impossible, people ruin even the easiest raids
[2:11:57] <KoyaMusa> you know what i really don't like about sync down content, that my aoe abilities go away
[2:11:58] <Aeonknight_87> @Story_Ark the dungeon proceeds normally, just much faster
[2:11:59] <+lord_sykos> I don't see them being able to fix this without causing some other issue.
[2:12:16] <$threedotmark> I've never even actually played crystal tower before because whenever I tried, the queue would never fill up enough after an hour and I always gave up
[2:12:22] <%ashenfrenzy> @Who_lio42 carpal tunnel
[2:12:23] <DrillStopsNoCops> @SinisterBroccoli That's the big one. Nerfed skill set. Hamstrings learning later rotations
[2:12:26] <+Namboto> @Basilias_Maximus it's been fixed for a while
[2:12:27] <+gaemjurnalist> @Who_lio42 button smashing and screaming
[2:12:34] <+Finaldragoon> won't making CT mandatory cause it to show up even more in alliance roulette?
[2:12:35] <penitentpentwitch> It will be mandatory for MSQ. So I can just duck on the alt to do any of the raids except the newest Automata and Crystal raid. I just won't be able to do MSQ on that alt from now on. Which I'm okay with, it's an alt.
[2:12:36] <%spiritofmojave> @who_lio42 pretty fun! they made some drastic changes with it, added some damage over times, lots of aoes and cooldowns. BUNCH of buttons. AND A MECH at 80
[2:12:36] <saraizarai> solution: item sync gear up
[2:12:38] <zenith0111> @aeonknight_87 It's just weird coming from like Runescape where doing all the content was the fun? lol So seeing a actual MMO with major subscribers who never even done Ex RR trials is weeeeird for me.
[2:12:39] <%walternatorz> average ilevel per item?
[2:12:41] <%Overlordkain> 2.X has a bunch of really important story related raids that were never actually mandatory
[2:12:46] <%FutaSnek> Like it's a game LUL there's an argument to be made that player enjoyment is paramount, I know alot of people disagree
[2:12:46] <skyheys> By making Crystal Tower part of MSQ roulette once it becomes mandatory, taking it off Alliance
[2:12:47] <%Overlordkain> like coil
[2:12:49] <DrillStopsNoCops> People spam Crystal Tower and wonder why they're bad at the game
[2:12:50] <Azathotic> @Story_Ark It encourages bad habits because there's no mechanics to learn much. Which makes people even worse when they get into higher Alliance Raids. All because Pat is smug yet dumb
[2:12:50] <Aeonknight_87> easy fix: increase the min ilvl to the max raid tier. can't queue for the roulette unles you're near max
[2:12:55] <Cedgewik> "half"
[2:13:01] <%BunnyEmperor> @Who_lio42 highest dps from physical ranged DPS, worst utility though
[2:13:06] <%Blackjack760> half...sure
[2:13:06] <%Dwarven_Gaming> ^^^
[2:13:10] <KoyaMusa> you have to incentivize doing the higher level ones, like prae is compared to castrum
[2:13:10] <%spiritofmojave> More than that usually let's be real
[2:13:18] <Drarrk> locking gear changing inside the dungeon would fix it
[2:13:20] <%Valdorick> Even yourself psaSmug
[2:13:23] <DrillStopsNoCops> oh right americans
[2:13:24] <zenith0111> I saw a tank do nothing but auto attack for the whole trial...
[2:13:25] <+abrupt_abe> Alliance C sucks, Alliance A rules
[2:13:31] <%spiritofmojave> especially yourself
[2:13:32] <+DecadeQuartzer> If Crystal Tower will be mandatory they might make a roulette with them like the Main Scenario one.
[2:13:34] <%plumlungs> OMG
[2:13:35] <shiibbae> people who have a bigger ilvl over a certain ammount will get lower xp?
[2:13:37] <%kralec> what the actual fuck rooBlank
[2:13:38] <%Blackjack760> HOW
[2:13:40] <Aeonknight_87> @zenith0111 there are reasons to go back and do old content. relics and such, old glamour options. and I think they're trying to address that in the upcoming updates
[2:13:42] <%spiritofmojave> WHAT
[2:13:42] <moosemonkey397> gdi WoD is so much harder than it needs to be
[2:13:43] <%Blackjack760> WHY
[2:13:46] <neVan0> OOF
[2:13:46] <%Shady_Squid> What the hell? What did you get stuck on?
[2:13:49] <SomeOtherNeb> how long does it normally take?
[2:13:49] <Darkencide> KEKW
[2:13:50] <+Remery_> That's why i stopped doing Random Extreme bosses. People just don't look up the bosses their about to do and just wing it
[2:13:50] <%Valdorick> Locking Gear changing doesn't change you just switching the gear after the queue pops but before you get in.
[2:13:51] <+cawi> people dont know how to chain the boss
[2:13:51] <olaksi> Covid players
[2:13:51] <KoyaMusa> man playing on north america data centers sure is suffering huh
[2:13:54] <tinyknot> WHO
[2:13:54] <andrei11dr> OOF
[2:13:58] <SomeOtherNeb> I haven't played in like 6 months and never did raids
[2:13:58] <%spiritofmojave> LUL
[2:14:00] <%SirGO0SE> hehe doody
[2:14:00] <@SSaryn> Should I assume it was Cerberus or Eye boi?
[2:14:02] <ColRedyx> At one point in WoW you had to complete a solo challenge to be able to queue into group content above a certain difficulty. The challenge was laughably easy but the shitstorm was enormous.
[2:14:04] <skyheys> @decadequartzer or just add it to msq so theres more than just two options
[2:14:05] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[2:14:06] <%Giggalith> Cerberus?
[2:14:12] <%Starotter70> LUL
[2:14:14] <%BunnyEmperor> because they are scared of the THUNDER GOD
[2:14:15] <KoyaMusa> it normally takes like 20 minutes
[2:14:18] <watts121> OMG who gave pat a GUN?!?!?!
[2:14:18] <%marsantas> Yeah people are so bad at math I just don't run that any more
[2:14:20] <DrillStopsNoCops> so americans are bad at FFXIV? got it
[2:14:20] <MyriadZen> they even nerfed orbonne too didnt they?
[2:14:20] <CyborgAV> We call those people "Cowards".
[2:14:21] <+xeros720> just let people do old alliance raids with ai
[2:14:22] <%AquilaHarukaze> I got queued in for Void Ark once and like haalf an alliance just vanihsed.
[2:14:22] <Aeonknight_87> @ColRedyx that's exactly what we need.
[2:14:22] <%Blackjack760> Irbonne is fun tho
[2:14:22] <+superdoomshroom> BUT ORBONNE IS SO FUN THO
[2:14:26] <+Finaldragoon> I remember a World of Darkness run where someone intentionally trolled with the chains and Cerberus to force wipe the group
[2:14:27] <Ryutaryi> That's great since I still have to do Monastery.
[2:14:28] <+Ilpala> What even are this guy's mechanics? They have been lost to time
[2:14:29] <AsiSed> shame, orbonne also is actually fun too
[2:14:29] <Azathotic> 99% of FFXIV players are fine, people like Pat are just huge crybabies who don't want the MM in MMORPG
[2:14:32] <%kralec> @PatStaresAt what server are you on? could just be a regional thing. I've never experienced that. rooThink
[2:14:32] <moosemonkey397> angry mayo and Cerby are both wipers
[2:14:32] <ToBais91> ah, wod siilver proving grounds Kappa
[2:14:33] <JoshWithASpoon> Honestly, I'd rather run out the timer on Orbonne than almost fall asleep doing any of the Crystal Tower raids.
[2:14:33] <andrei11dr> Probably Cerberus
[2:14:33] <zenith0111> @aeonknight_87 My problem is trying to find parties willing to do unsync. I'm not here to clear the quest I'm here for the challenge. I've just been getting a lot of flack for my style of play.
[2:14:36] <+Namboto> Thunder God isn't even hard anymore
[2:14:37] <maddragon249> Orbonne is the beat raid tho
[2:14:38] <DrillStopsNoCops> The ivalice raids are so much damn fun
[2:14:38] <ScarletPrime> Honestly, elitist hot take. Crystal Tower Cheese being a thing you can do is part of why everyone is so bad at this game. Never get confronted with content that can possibly be a threat.
[2:14:42] <%spiritofmojave> They either don't know the mechanics or don't wanna risk one of the alliances in Orbonne being terrible
[2:14:42] <Cedgewik> thunder god is the better ramuh
[2:14:43] <+Remery_> Americans are bad everything that isnt a FPS
[2:14:45] <%BunnyEmperor> SB has the best Alliance Raids

[2:14:48] <skyheys> @azathotic haha no

[2:14:50] <+the22cstomp> @Azathotic no a lot of ffxiv players just suck
[2:14:50] <DrillStopsNoCops> @ScarletPrime YES
[2:14:54] <+Remery_> or sportsball
[2:14:55] <+the22cstomp> they're godawful
[2:14:56] <%Fatmanjoggin> and people thought the wiping city was bad
[2:14:59] <+gaemjurnalist> my first world of darkness run was amazing, some guys in the chat were talking about soup and i died 3 times 10/10
[2:15:00] <+crazyspartan214> I just got here. Did you know they delay the patch again till Aug 11th and do you think this is a good move with everything around the world going to shit?
[2:15:04] <%spiritofmojave> @scarletprime YEP it's a regressive system
[2:15:05] <+Namboto> cowards
[2:15:08] <skyheys> they're not wrong
[2:15:10] <+GrayFox2510> Thankfully, I've never had that many issues with Alliance Raid, regardless of which one shows up.
[2:15:11] <+Namboto> big cowards
[2:15:14] <%valriot> Its only a cheese cos everyone is HUGE
[2:15:15] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> @Remery_ We're also good at racing games :^)
[2:15:15] <%dekkitout> Riven from D2 comes to mind from that statement
[2:15:22] <Azathotic> @skyheys @the22cstomp If you hate the playerbase this much why are you still playing?
[2:15:22] <supersonic21> its not optional if your a bard, amons hat is REQUIRED
[2:15:27] <olaksi> Eeeh
[2:15:29] <AsiSed> Well "obtional" clearing was a requirement for Shadowbringers
[2:15:30] <%xWanderingFlame> psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead
[2:15:30] <ColRedyx> @Aeonknight_87 Yeah, the solo duties were perfect for making sure players had to learn to a certain baseline to progress in the game at all. Then they became easier, and now you can lower the difficulty if you fail them...
[2:15:30] <%SirGO0SE> LUL
[2:15:35] <KoyaMusa> @PatStaresAt remember when people complained about that zenos solo instance in 4.5? its sad
[2:15:39] <saraizarai> I mean Shinryu was a bitch
[2:15:39] <SomeOtherNeb> If people really want to cheese leveling, they just do Main Quest Roulette and do Pare/Castrum once a day
[2:15:40] <%xWanderingFlame> LUL
[2:15:44] <aeonicvector> I mean, shadowbringers gets close
[2:15:44] <+Remery_> @NotSoAccurateNo1 thought it was UK's field

[2:16:00] <saraizarai> Titania is a shitshow nowadays
[2:16:03] <%valriot> Theres no enforced difficulty, or encouragement to "get better"
[2:16:03] <Vakojin> I remember Shinryu, it was fun
[2:16:03] <%Th3SmartAlec> Shin Ryu, what was that, a Street Fighter crossover event?
[2:16:05] <+cawi> steps of faith people couldn't do until they nerfed it several times
[2:16:06] <skyheys> @azathotic I dont hate the playerbase. I'm just not gonna lie and say the vast majority of the players are competent.
[2:16:08] <+haunt_r> I remember everyone bitching about Shinryu, it wasnt even that hard. It was just fun.
[2:16:08] <KeiPrime> cant even count the amount of times i did shinryu on two hands
[2:16:10] <Vakojin> People complained non stop
[2:16:11] <+Story_Ark> Ya know, thats true. the msq hasnt given me any issues and has been pretty easy. only time i try is when i did the binding coil with my guild
[2:16:13] <Cedgewik> how many crystal towers do you see wipe to the flares on the last boss lmao
[2:16:13] <%apolitenoob> Holy shit Shinryu, that was exciting
[2:16:14] <%marsantas> There needs to be a solo skill check to progress in the story each expansion

[2:16:18] <ToBais91> is this why you can't die to fall damage or fall into a void?

[2:16:44] <KoyaMusa> no shinryu wasn't nerfed?
[2:16:47] <Byr0nX> 1st try and we did it but that was lik last year
[2:16:50] <Azathotic> @the22cstomp THEN WHY ARE YOU COMPLAINING ABOUT THE BAD PLAYERS NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[2:16:51] <DrillStopsNoCops> Not everything should be savage level but come on
[2:16:51] <XyraFhoan> they never nerfed Shinryu, people just got better gear
[2:16:56] <+Finaldragoon> Don't forget 4.55 and the solo fight against Zenos that players couldn't beat because they were bad causing the devs to implement an easy mode for solo story fights
[2:16:56] <Kain5707> it was?
[2:16:59] <+lock364> It wasn't nerf
[2:16:59] <CptHarlok> Secret World had a boss like that. I think it was literally called Gatekeeper...
[2:17:03] <mikesapartment> IT WAS NOT
[2:17:03] <JoshWithASpoon> People who were complaining about Shinryu probably couldn't do Savage content anyway LuL
[2:17:06] <+Namboto> shin never got nerfed, ilvl just got better
[2:17:06] <%spiritofmojave> Thundergod Cid was nerfed?
[2:17:08] <%BunnyEmperor> Worms Tails is a dope boss theme

[2:17:12] <Kain5707> LUL
[2:17:13] <penitentpentwitch> They've stated that Crystal Tower will be mandatory for starting Shadowbringers. So there is a small chance that I will be grandfathered past the requirement and not need to unlock Crystal Tower raids.
[2:17:15] <+Remery_> Bitch Baby Patch
[2:17:18] <%xWanderingFlame> psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead
[2:17:19] <Byr0nX> just avoid the floor
[2:17:20] <andrei11dr> That happened to me with Hades ,and it was just, oof
[2:17:20] <%Broand> Where's good places to find good looking gear for glamour purposes?
[2:17:22] <KoyaMusa> neither are we
[2:17:23] <mikesapartment> normal was never nerfed
[2:17:23] <+GrayFox2510> People had trouble withe solo Zenos fights? They are just boringly slow.
[2:17:25] <%Overlordkain> I went back and spammed Shinyru after finishing the SB story because I have to collect all the cards. It was bad
[2:17:25] <%xWanderingFlame> LUL
[2:17:26] <Aeonknight_87> Steps of Faith got nerfed, but i dont remember if Shinryu did
[2:17:28] <%SomersaultJustice> TIME FOR SPLOSIONS
[2:17:29] <+barkraccoon> They did the same thing to Steps of Faith
[2:17:30] <Kain5707> yea normal
[2:17:34] <+the22cstomp> most ex fights are easily clearable too
[2:17:34] <%SirGO0SE> i hate easy braindead shit so much :(
[2:17:35] <%xWanderingFlame> ncshappySwiss
[2:17:35] <Kain5707> thats fucking wild
[2:17:39] <+cactuarzzzzzzz> this chat is retarded
[2:17:39] <JoshWithASpoon> WAIT
[2:17:43] <%spiritofmojave> Maybe they upped the tail damage, I actually forget most of Stormblood
[2:17:46] <Byr0nX> story one with the platforms
[2:17:46] <JoshWithASpoon> Nidhogg was nerfed??
[2:17:47] <%valriot> Ok but Steps of Faith is FUCKING. GARBAGE.
[2:17:47] <%Shady_Squid> How hard was OG Shinryu compared to say, a normal eden Titan?
[2:17:50] <Azathotic> Oh dear god we wiped twice, what a nightmare
[2:17:52] <%Ninestempest> NAH
[2:17:53] <%Ninestempest> TITANITA
[2:17:54] <zenith0111> @penitentpentwitch My friends never touched the raids and they're doing SB right now. I hate them lmao
[2:17:58] <+Grayhammatter> oh god, it's gonna be a wipe on amon
[2:17:59] <+GrayFox2510> @Broand look up Glamour Collection on Google. Not sure if I can link.
[2:18:01] <skyheys> nidhoggs fun
[2:18:02] <%Ninestempest> TITANIA IS HILARIOUS
[2:18:02] <KoyaMusa> remember when they nefed the fucking vault
[2:18:05] <%kralec> @PatStaresAt Shin ryu did not get nerfed, but they had access to stormbringers gear so it became easier. a soft nerf if you will
[2:18:06] <%Blackjack760> TITANIA IS THE WIRST
[2:18:07] <aeonicvector> Titania, people need to ACTUALLY function there
[2:18:07] <Ubu2933> huh I wonder if I got through shin ryu beofre it was nerfed or not I don't remember having any problems with it
[2:18:07] <%BunnyEmperor> Niddy? No, why? Because of Hot Tail?
[2:18:10] <%kindashagg> People still get blown up by him when he asks you to stack
[2:18:11] <watts121> Yep, I once did a Nidhogg roulette where we wiped like 5 times before we got it done
[2:18:11] <%briktal> my last two trials were final steps
[2:18:13] <Flakari> Also people run away from stack markers allllll the time
[2:18:14] <SomeOtherNeb> the bridge one? But it's super easy
[2:18:15] <supersonic21> titanita or what my freind called it scottland ex
[2:18:17] <%xWanderingFlame> LUL
[2:18:17] <%plumlungs> yea Titania can be rough tbhStressed
[2:18:17] <Vakojin> The level in NA seems to be really shit, amazing
[2:18:20] <watts121> Titania is similar as well
[2:18:20] <%bigbrothergannon> aren't there super bosses in this game for try hards?
[2:18:21] <%spiritofmojave> Oh yeah they had to actually BUFF Nidhogg for unsynced recently LUL he was nerfed that bad
[2:18:27] <watts121> Titania feels like a mid-game wall
[2:18:27] <Dral54> And the lord said "Get fucked idiot"
[2:18:28] <xemeas> i love nid hogs fight so much but man do people not know how to stack
[2:18:29] <+gustavozxd> how am I supposed to learn the mechanics though?
[2:18:32] <XyraFhoan> normal mode Shinryu wasn't touched, Steps of Faith was nerfed, Final Steps had the add phase enrage more obvious as the dragons become untargetable, Chrysalis got Echo added on wipes eventually
[2:18:38] <Futurecity10> Pat to be fair your server is just full of idiots. In Aether, I've had less than 10 bad roulette experiences
[2:18:42] <%gespenst25> Pat what DC are you on? this stuff never feels like a struggle on crystal
[2:18:45] <penitentpentwitch> @zenith0111 Unfortunate, but we'll see how they make it mandatory in 5.3.
[2:18:46] <%Valdorick> You'll go insane from her song.
[2:18:49] <Byr0nX> I tanked on nid a\nd I never tank it was fine. guess they sucked
[2:18:51] <+the22cstomp> I had a run in titania where one of the tanks refused to tank an add so I would end up taking aggro as a monk
[2:18:52] <Aeonknight_87> People don't know how to stack for Akh Morns
[2:18:53] <ricotez> people usually catch on to Titania after a wipe or two
[2:19:06] <+Finaldragoon> too many times with Titania I've seen Tanks wipe the party because they spun her for Divination Rune
[2:19:08] <%ragingbrachy> SourPls
[2:19:10] <%danguinplays> are people so stubborn where they dont look at a guide for duties?
[2:19:12] <Jdrockefeller> I recently learned that if people don't place the Titania stack marker in the water while the grass is up, IT SETS THE WHOLE FUCKING ARENA ON FIRE.
[2:19:13] <Azathotic> @Futurecity10 I'm in Primal, same. Pat is just one of those MMO players
[2:19:14] <+cawi> I have seen DPS checks fail on titania normal
[2:19:14] <%AquilaHarukaze> Once a Titania run was taking so long I zoned out and thought I was doing extreme
[2:19:15] <%valriot> la la la la la la~
[2:19:15] <%BunnyEmperor> every normal mode mechanic is so slow and weak that you can easily do them without knowing how they work, or at least do them without killing everyone else
[2:19:17] <JoshWithASpoon> I don't understand how Titania can be rough. Like, do people just not meet the DPS check?
[2:19:19] <+dredgyboi> i dont remember titania bveing a problem..>OH MY GOD I WAS THE BAD
[2:19:19] <+Story_Ark> @patstaresat hey pat, so after beating ARR, do you recommend doing (optional) dungeons to get gear or just continue through MSQ?
[2:19:21] <+GrayFox2510> Hey, Titania's song is awesome.
[2:19:23] <ricotez> also E8S is so hard wtf, some of those mechanics are at Ultimate level
[2:19:25] <%Metballs> Shame they added easy mode for that
[2:19:27] <KoyaMusa> i'm still baffled that people found the zenos solo trial tough
[2:19:29] <%Blackjack760> People duck
[2:19:30] <zenith0111> @penitentpentwitch I can see why they would because it has some important lore in it. I've done the raids in RR
[2:19:31] <SomeOtherNeb> the main story really shouldn't be hat easy, yeah
[2:19:32] <+Grayhammatter> mandatory solo, like memoria would be awesome
[2:19:33] <mikesapartment> im pretty sure the new solo trial was a test for that moving forward
[2:19:40] <%unremarkableprodigy> Is there ever a point where all mechanics are explained in game
[2:19:42] <Aeonknight_87> @dannypenguin06 most fights are self intuitive enough to not need it. only end game content "requires" guides
[2:19:47] <%spiritofmojave> Remember when people thought you had to ranged LB Titania's add phase, because dps check is haaaard
[2:19:48] <%TONYOO101> e8s isnt that bad, lr is just a bit clunky
[2:19:49] <%TheSpartanThief> What about paid content skips though? They not only let shits through but also teach them NOTHING, meaning they're worse than the regular bad players.
[2:19:50] <aeonicvector> it was baby easy
[2:19:50] <gatoralus> I finished shadowbringers msq a couple weeks ago and it is the hypest ever, like this expansion is amazing i loved it, still need to do the patches tho
[2:19:52] <+Sadira_snack_attack> Yes please give me more solo content
[2:19:52] <olaksi> *Solo duty
[2:19:52] <%SomersaultJustice> you mean in ala mhigo?
[2:19:52] <watts121> Where you had to 1v1 him twice
[2:19:54] <%Ninestempest> he's the boss for ala mhigo??
[2:19:55] <%Blackjack760> there's was it was easy
[2:19:57] <+lock364> 4.5
[2:19:57] <ScarletPrime> I think he means the 2 times you fight him in solo duties during the MSQ?
[2:19:58] <Cedgewik> JoshWithASpoon yeah people missed the dps check on the adds was SUPER common last year
[2:19:59] <+peekaytom> went to look for this nerf that you talked about and i didn't realize story trials get 50% echo
[2:19:59] <KoyaMusa> at the end of 4.5 and you play as hien, people thought playing as hien, with 3 buttons, was hard
[2:20:01] <JoshWithASpoon> The story Trial in Rhalgr's Reach?
[2:20:01] <moosemonkey397> the one at the end of gimlyt dark?
[2:20:01] <Kain5707> wait people thought it was hard?!
[2:20:02] <+Finaldragoon> the one at the end of 4.55 Pat
[2:20:02] <Byr0nX> SB with the swords at the base???
[2:20:03] <watts121> Once in Rhalgr and the other in Japan
[2:20:03] <+fenix122> I think they're talking about the end of Stormblood, where you fight Zenos as *SPOILER CHARACTER* first.
[2:20:04] <+lemurbreeder> it was the last patch pre-shadowbringers
[2:20:07] <%LaughingCatt> @PatStaresAt 4.55 brick ElidiZenos walls the bads
[2:20:08] <%damienlunas> @PatStaresAt You should have seen how bad Plague was getting his ass kicked in some of those solo duties
[2:20:11] <Ks201> i think they mean the dungeon fight
[2:20:13] <%Ninestempest> LOL
[2:20:13] <+numjoy> 95% of the playerbase for this game just isn't good. The game does little to nothing to emphasize actually doing DPS outside of harder trials/raids
[2:20:14] <%Metballs> And yet easy mode
[2:20:15] <+the22cstomp> YES
[2:20:15] <SomeOtherNeb> the ones you're MEANT TO LOSE?
[2:20:16] <%valriot> People dont realise, when Pats saying trash, he means FUCKING. BAAAAAAAAAAAAAD. Like laughable.
[2:20:16] <OneThousandTomatoes> I remember being annoyed by how much I got carried in dungeons. I basically just sat back and did nothing unless I was the healer.
[2:20:17] <+REDtheBEAST> LUL
[2:20:17] <Dral54> People still bitch about the Sadu solo fight
[2:20:17] <%SirGO0SE> would people might be a little better if pvp was more prevalent in this game? nothing catches you up to speed like another person showing you what youre doing wrong through griefing LUL
[2:20:20] <watts121> My GF died to them
[2:20:21] <+lemurbreeder> exactly
[2:20:22] <Kain5707> WHY
[2:20:22] <%Blackjack760> YEAH YES
[2:20:23] <%BunnyEmperor> LUL complaining about MSQ fights
[2:20:24] <%spiritofmojave> Like the VERY LAST Stormblood fight LUL
[2:20:25] <%Starotter70> BabyRage BabyRage BabyRage BabyRage BabyRage BabyRage BabyRage
[2:20:26] <watts121> it was a rough day
[2:20:26] <MyriadZen> is this when square adds a tutorial to explain mechanics and how to play classes?
[2:20:26] <ColRedyx> @unremarkableprodigy Not explicitly. You're just supposed to pay attention to what happens when they appear.
[2:20:26] <+Finaldragoon> yes sadly
[2:20:28] <+cawi> watch someone die to the stack or earthquake of this fight
[2:20:33] <%spiritofmojave> It took literally a try
[2:20:33] <skyheys> making hard solo trials sucked for NIN players pre 5.1, your output was super low due to positionals
[2:20:34] <saraizarai> Oh yeah, plague beat Shinryu by watching 7 people kill it from the floor
[2:20:35] <%republicofu> thise are NOTHING
[2:20:35] <XyraFhoan> Titania's a hard fight for conventions despite staff telling everyone all the mechanics, since you get a lot of people who've never played, to the point where the win rate hovered around 20% or less, very awkward
[2:20:36] <%Metballs> People STILL bitch after they added easy difficulty to them, Pat
[2:20:37] <Byr0nX> OMG yea people suck then. I did thos as monk
[2:20:39] <supersonic21> the only one i think i ever had issues with was the post stormblood one where you play as cat girl whos name i cant spell
[2:20:39] <%TONYOO101> they made it braindead in the solo fights since if you died you can hit easy mode
[2:20:39] <+lord_sykos> The 4.55 one, not the 4.x ones.
[2:20:40] <%kralec> @PatStaresAt did you play through MSQ as a tank?
[2:20:43] <%AquilaHarukaze> RIP that BLM
[2:20:43] <+NanoComputer> @unremarkableprodigy WOL has like future-sight so that is why we can see attacks before they are triggered.
[2:20:45] <Aeonknight_87> @PatStaresAt Pat I've got people in my FC who were struggling with the Roleplaying as NPC solo instances
[2:20:46] <%gespenst25> what do you mean? Zenos wins every time
[2:20:49] <%animaturgy> Sadu was the annoying one for me as a tank
[2:20:49] <Azathotic> @SirGO0SE PvP does not share the same skills as regular PvE
[2:20:50] <Ks201> i think there talking about he dungeon fight right before you fight shinryu
[2:20:51] <%danguinplays> @aeonknight_87 oh yeah I agree, but there's a point where I dont want to burden other players just in case
[2:20:54] <%unremarkableprodigy> They can be hard without geat
[2:20:56] <+Sadira_snack_attack> It sounds elitist because it is
[2:20:56] <penitentpentwitch> @zenith0111 It makes sense they make it mandatory, story wise. I've done them on my main. I literally made the Alt for the whole purpose of having something different in Alliance Roulette.
[2:20:57] <Snowcone01> I think it's bad doing it as a healer. You do rubbish damage for msq quests. It just takes forever
[2:20:57] <ColRedyx> See that Red Mage that ran out of the group and died alone? That's the kind of player Pat's talking about.
[2:21:03] <KoyaMusa> OH THIS ONE
[2:21:03] <+Finaldragoon> @PatStaresAt people complained so hard that solo story fights now have a casual mode option if you fail it enough times
[2:21:05] <%Valdorick> All about how your life got flipped turned upside down?
[2:21:06] <$Dakuu75> @SirGO0SE yeah but, usually that kind of stupp happens in the blink of an eye and your stuck going "Uhh... what jsut happened."
[2:21:08] <Kain5707> LUL
[2:21:08] <+GrayFox2510> And there goes a guy taking a stack marker away from the group...
[2:21:09] <shiibbae> oh boy
[2:21:11] <%ragingbrachy> me? :)
[2:21:11] <%rumtumtugnutz> Somebody told me the Zenos fight was gonna be hard and I finished it my second try.

[2:22:15] <%Truniron> Truniron subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months, currently on a 6 month streak! Here's to the dreaded Azma fight that broke the guild appart. Huge cheer to Lord Pat
[2:22:19] <%Overlordkain> damage AND mechanics? you ask too much
[2:22:23] <penitentpentwitch> You get 'you don't pay my sub' at it's worst in those cases
[2:22:23] <%walternatorz> those idiots are the people not wearing masks
[2:22:25] <+numjoy> DPS? In my MMO? You are expecting me to hit buttons???
[2:22:26] <+Finaldragoon> Pat this is the same player base that can't do basic math in Ridorana Lighthouse
[2:22:28] <Vakojin> @skyheys Still need to do some quest as summoner
[2:22:30] <%spiritofmojave> incoming wipes to ancient quaga even LUL
[2:22:31] <%Dwarven_Gaming> PLACE METEORS
[2:22:39] <+Remery_> But there's 15 DPS
[2:22:39] <%BunnyEmperor> it will get better Kappa
[2:22:44] <chickenhunter> prime numbers baby
[2:22:44] <+NanoComputer> @SomeOtherNeb I like going into a fight blind, to learn on the fly.
[2:22:46] <%SirGO0SE> @Azathotic honestly, with changes like that im kind of shocked that pvp isnt bigger in this game. most games have an issue balancing it, but if theyre swapping skills out altogether shouldnt it be pretty good?
[2:22:46] <%Guardiansaiyan> thinks PatStaresAT is Sponsored by Square Enix imGlitch FIRST DAY
[2:22:46] <@SSaryn> And then the 2nd time.
[2:22:47] <%Cardz_> These are the kinds of people that die to ancient flare
[2:22:47] <+cawi> There are still healers that dont DPS at high level
[2:22:49] <%ssjklyco> Sup guys
[2:22:50] <@SSaryn> And then the 3rd time.
[2:22:51] <zenith0111> @someotherneb Even then most of the time you can pick up on what to do with basic observation.
[2:22:54] <+GrayFox2510> Math boss is best boss.
[2:22:54] <$QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt God damn it Pat Over/Under is not odds of whether something will happen, it's how many times it will happen
[2:22:55] <moosemonkey397> then you go to baldesion arsenal...
[2:22:56] <+Grayhammatter> it's so bad
[2:22:59] <%spiritofmojave> then weeks
[2:23:00] <+REDtheBEAST> NotLikeThis
[2:23:02] <Tomschiii> @someotherneb where is the fun in that
[2:23:09] <%dekkitout> Oryx fight for the first month in a nutshell....
[2:23:13] <%koolaid_kevster> where is little LIGHTNING?!
[2:23:18] <Futurecity10> Pat is just sounds like Primal sucks ass
[2:23:18] <%LaughingCatt> Ozma & Cid, best bros in wiping raids
[2:23:25] <Azathotic> @SirGO0SE Because even with the changes, PvP feels unbalanced and everyone plays the clusterfuck large scale PvP where your skills dont matter, the deathball matters
[2:23:25] <%BunnyEmperor> you still have to do zombification and the ozma meteors
[2:23:25] <KoyaMusa> ffxiv is a game that doesn't require the average player to improve and still so many can slip through the cracks despite the devs' attempts
[2:23:27] <@SSaryn> Comets are the only thing you need to legitimately do anymmore.
[2:23:35] <OneThousandTomatoes> I liked playing healer because it was challenging, if not incredibly aggravating
[2:23:35] <%SomersaultJustice> maybe Primal is just bad Kappa
[2:23:39] <ricotez> Cid was hard but not as hard as Ozma
[2:23:45] <+gustavozxd> @someotherneb having to do that is fucking terrible
[2:23:46] <%Cardz_> How I learned to love thunder god
[2:23:48] <SomeOtherNeb> Chat I get the appeal of running into shit blind, but at smoe point it's about respecting other people's time
[2:23:48] <%Daniel_Is_I> Ahahaha, no fuck you I'm doing Lab/Syrcus
[2:23:49] <Aeonknight_87> that's fair.
[2:23:51] <%kralec> so you cowarded out huh rooBlank
[2:23:51] <+linSP> so cheat lie steal
[2:23:52] <CookieCatte> you tell 'em Pat!
[2:23:53] <%dekkitout> "You don't pay my sub"?
[2:23:58] <%JonathLP> punished pat needs his sleep
[2:23:59] <youucherwatt> yo gotta respect it
[2:24:03] <%SirGO0SE> @Azathotic ah that paints a pretty clear picture. it does seem like something that can be made better going forward though
[2:24:04] <CookieCatte> fuck the whiners
[2:24:05] <%spiritofmojave> same now, just Allegory grind
[2:24:08] <Futurecity10> Aether is so chill and great I love it
[2:24:11] <skyheys> booooo, content > number
[2:24:12] <%spiritofmojave> Main story/alliance
[2:24:13] <Archmortal> I want Labyrinth for the gear, one drop per boss is brutal to collect it
[2:24:16] <%Metballs> Yeah, this is big "Y don't pay my sub" energy
[2:24:16] <%Arxel1> Pat, just tell the people that wanna run Cid that they DONT PAY YOUR SUB and you wannna just do your roulette
[2:24:18] <ricotez> there's no problem with going into content blind if you are able to listen to instructions and know how to play your job
[2:24:23] <SomeOtherNeb> most dungeons don't NEED you to read up but some kinda do if you don't want to waste a ton of time
[2:24:28] <%ragingbrachy> the uh...
[2:24:33] <+Remery_> Yea that's why i stop doing extremes with randoms. No one looks up the boss before they do it and just wing it.
[2:24:34] <%Cactuskris> they could just make it like wow and make a version without more than one mechanic
[2:24:35] <KoyaMusa> basically, play on a jp server
[2:24:38] <penitentpentwitch> I literally just had a run of Math Boss where someone who failed all questions said in chat, "This is bullshit, I do enough damage to ignore mechanics." Twas funny.
[2:24:45] <xemeas> they should just make a hard version of those raids and have them just be the unpatched versions , and put them on a roulet
[2:24:46] <+Remery_> Especially the tanks just kill everyone
[2:24:51] <+Namboto> Yeah, Aether is pretty neat, never really had any problems on Middy
[2:24:57] <%Cardz_> Math is the true endgame
[2:25:04] <%ragingbrachy> SourPls SourPls SourPls
[2:25:04] <+Grayhammatter> oh hey, titan
[2:25:04] <+the22cstomp> watch someone die here
[2:25:07] <%thegreatbambe> don't fall off
[2:25:10] <%Cardz_> Time to watch people get flung off the edge
[2:25:10] <Azathotic> @SirGO0SE They need better incentives, long term. Right now, certain modes gives you currency for rare items but its an event. You can level classes but it doesnt teach you the class. Theres PvP armor for cosmetics but not enough and some looks like ass
[2:25:11] <+Grayhammatter> blblblblblbl titan
[2:25:13] <%Blackjack760> MATH
[2:25:19] <%kralec> @PatStaresAt oh! so it's people like you that prevent me from getting the fun Alliance Raids. rooREE

[2:25:39] <+LiberatedPhoenix> I have a spreadsheet for that
[2:25:40] <penitentpentwitch> Yup! Exactly.
[2:25:40] <$QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Dun Scaith is pronounced "Dune Sky" and Mhach is pronounced "Vah". Irish Gaelic is an extremely stupid language
[2:25:44] <Archmortal> I once STILL managed to complete Thundergod Cid after like five people bailed because the remainder just knew the damn mechanics
[2:25:45] <%Blackjack760> MATH TOO HARD
[2:25:46] <%ssjklyco> Is this the new expansion or has that not come out yet?
[2:25:48] <+gaemjurnalist> lol titan

[2:26:12] <%SirGO0SE> @Azathotic tbh i dont even need incentive. i used to have a pvp vid series in WoW and i just miss playing this style of game against people
[2:26:13] <+someyounguy1> what do y ou mean, l;ike the boss puts out rings and you have to do simple math to get in the safe zone?
[2:26:14] <olaksi> I think it's more that people don't realize it's just a simple math puzzle
[2:26:16] <%Dwarven_Gaming> ahh yes THE PEOPLE DEBUFF
[2:26:17] <$QueequegTheater> I WANT TO ICE MAGE THO
[2:26:17] <ScarletPrime> Legit the only part of Construct 7 you should die to is being fucked by "One is not a Prime Number."

[2:26:32] <KeiPrime> dont play
[2:26:35] <%ArchimerDreatect> People trying to justify failing Construct's game gives me life because there's NEVER and i mean NEVER a good answer to not knowing multiples of 4
[2:26:35] <%BunnyEmperor> premade party of Ultimate raiders LUL
[2:26:36] <%Poncho_Freestyle> at least they're all contained in the FFxiv community

[2:26:39] <+gustavozxd> @queequegtheater oh no is that really a thing?
[2:26:39] <Iwashi94> Only thing I hate about the roulettes is how much you're forced to go through the Praetorium and Castrum cutscenes

[2:27:01] <Apolonm> Friends?
[2:27:03] <Vakojin> But what's a multiple of 2 tough PAT ?
[2:27:03] <%Daniel_Is_I> Step 1: Have friends. Step 2: Don't not have friends.
[2:27:04] <+crazyspartan214> but I have no friends

[2:27:29] <penitentpentwitch> I have a friend who's done the exact opposite of me. They have an alt that ONLY has the crystal raids unlocked. The game freaks out if we try to alliance queue together.
[2:27:29] <robodisney> Ugggh, the life of a healer. It made me such a mean person
[2:27:30] <XyraFhoan> become a healer so good, no one dies
[2:27:32] <%ChaosAethr> what if you dont have 5 friends
[2:27:35] <@SSaryn> You could also join Pat's Discord by subbing and getting people to help you just saying haha.. unless..

[2:27:47] <$QueequegTheater> I was too busy using Holy
[2:27:47] <ricotez> during one run of Orbonne I had to heal another alliance because both of their healers were COMPLETELY useless
[2:27:48] <Robot_Nixon_> FeelsBadMan
[2:27:48] <olaksi> Number of commendation is reversely proportional to how much you carry

[2:28:01] <Ryutaryi> Playing healer makes minimizing your chat a great idea
[2:28:02] <%kralec> @PatStaresAt but going "you guys suck" as you finish the raid is so much more cathartic when you actually finish it. rooDevil
[2:28:05] <%spiritofmojave> Leveling AST/WHM/SCH made me a worse person
[2:28:08] <saraizarai> Pat, stop eating exploding boulders

[2:28:59] <DarkCloud79> Leviathan is better
[2:29:00] <@BigNaturalMan59> UNDER THE WEIGHT
[2:29:01] <%ssjklyco> This titan design looks aweful
[2:29:01] <%BunnyEmperor> you mean the Eden 3 theme
[2:29:01] <+Remery_> Tanks that don't take agro off the main tank :(
[2:29:01] <zenith0111> I can't believe the got the band from Flcl to do a track

[2:29:05] <%spiritofmojave> Leviathan LEVIATHAN
[2:29:06] <@SSaryn> The PRIMALS version of Under the Weight is pretty damn good.
[2:29:06] <%kralec> @PatStaresAt I think the Edensgate versions are waaay better

[2:29:37] <%Dwarven_Gaming> you hear the orchestrated version of the shadowbringers final boss pat? ITS A SLAPPER
[2:29:38] <SomeOtherNeb> man roulettes for DDs is so much faster in US servers!
[2:29:40] <$QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt It's really funny how 3 of the tanks have good explanations for how they externalize their emotions (hope for Pally and anger for DRK) or how the Gunbreakers use super complex explosions to repel damage but my WAR is over to the side screaming about how much they love big fucking axes
[2:29:43] <%Cardz_> hoo boy
[2:29:44] <%WhereIsWill> aurum vale lets go
[2:29:46] <KoyaMusa> you don't need to be alone, you just can't fulfill the max party req
[2:29:52] <mikesapartment> that's wrong, the highest level dungeon gives you less exp from the roulette bonus
[2:29:57] <ricotez> Sohm Al is pretty fun
[2:29:57] <ToBais91> I just did this for the first time!
[2:30:05] <TioXyco> if you do the roulette as Class in need,you get an EXP bonus, as long as you don't go in a full party
[2:30:07] <ricotez> better than Tam Tara
[2:30:07] <%FutaSnek> YES
[2:30:08] <%spiritofmojave> this one's ok! usually

[2:30:09] <%Katashi25> @patstaresat I watch my friend bash his head again Titan Extreme (if that's the correct way to say it)
[2:30:09] <%FutaSnek> DAMN IT
[2:30:13] <%FutaSnek> SO CLOSE
[2:30:13] <%Valdorick> Be sure to kill your team, Tank.
[2:30:14] <Cedgewik> commend fishing LUL
[2:30:14] <Aeonknight_87> He's doing big boy pulls!
[2:30:15] <KeiPrime> fill out your journal
[2:30:15] <%Daniel_Is_I> I genuinely thought that was a cliff
[2:30:16] <%NWR_James> "Lets have a good one!" "NO!"
[2:30:17] <%spiritofmojave> LUL
[2:30:19] <%TheSpartanThief> Well, it was nice to hear Pat talk about shitty players while I was in the levelling roulette....WITH shitty players.
[2:30:19] <+RocketBarrel> Hey Pat how come you don't do Savage? You have friends and able to form a static pretty easily.
[2:30:20] <%AquilaHarukaze> The sticky dungeon
[2:30:20] <+crazyspartan214> lol
[2:30:21] <Aeonknight_87> Give this tank you rcommend
[2:30:22] <+haunt_r> better than 1 button sastasha too
[2:30:24] <$QueequegTheater> Tamtara forever
[2:30:26] <%BunnyEmperor> ah yes these are the Vampire Bloodlines strats from Pat
[2:30:27] <%Valdorick> wait... no, nevermind, mecha isn't a tank.
[2:30:29] <%kralec> @PatStaresAt at least it's nnot aurum vale rooKek
[2:30:35] <%Guardiansaiyan> thinks PatStaresAT is Sponsored by Square Enix imGlitch #NOOBSLIVESMATTER
[2:30:36] <%apolitenoob> I thought the lower the level of the dungeon for leveling was better?
[2:30:39] <+killer_squid1990> Cutter's Cry is probably the worst one
[2:30:40] <%Daniel_Is_I> Baby DRG
[2:30:43] <+killer_squid1990> No one knows what silences are
[2:30:50] <zenith0111> You're not a Tank Pat.... wtf
[2:30:52] <zamzoph> the dragoon could be leveling a different class
[2:30:53] <%Cardz_> The drg also popped battle litany on the first pull so
[2:30:53] <+Grayhammatter> one babby floor tank
[2:30:54] <Vakojin> How about some Brayflox
[2:31:01] <%BunnyEmperor> Hard mode of this dungeon has a sick theme playin
[2:31:04] <%Joustar_> G U N T A N K
[2:31:05] <%spiritofmojave> that dragoon is baby
[2:31:09] <KoyaMusa> you really shouldn't make fun of the hashtag like that man
[2:31:09] <%Daniel_Is_I> Hey we floor tanks are a proud people.
[2:31:10] <KeiPrime> fighting foodon?
[2:31:14] <andrei11dr> prablablo?
[2:31:17] <skyheys> @apolitenoob you get a bigger bonus, but the natural dungeon exp is better
[2:31:21] <%TONYOO101> pat awoken to the power of gun
[2:31:24] <penitentpentwitch> My ultimate plan for the Alt. I'll be a 'roulette mule' for my friends. I have a friend who swears every time they get LOTA, so I can switch to my Alt and run alliance Roulette with 'em and they can benefit. Even though, in a worst case scenario, my Alt will be locked out of MSQ from that point on.
[2:31:29] <saraizarai> Dragoon is a very fitting class to be a newbie in HW
[2:31:29] <@PlagueOfGripes> I never could find a way to make my dragoon set not look terrible
[2:31:46] <$QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Gameplay-wise Halo 2 is better than Half-Life 2. Gottem suck it nerdz
[2:31:49] <%xWanderingFlame> LUL
[2:31:50] <+Remery_> why do all dragoons look like beetles?
[2:31:51] <KoyaMusa> i agree plague, getting a good drg set sucks to do
[2:31:54] <%aslfrasle> God, i can't wait to get back into FFXIV once my Bar Exam is done on the 29th...
[2:31:56] <%Cardz_> He's using AOEs so he's doing fine
[2:31:56] <Strongfish91> is pat a huge big dick expert on all there is to do in the game?? what bout eureka content
[2:31:59] <+gustavozxd> I just use the regular dragoon armor
[2:32:06] <%aslfrasle> I miss playing so much...
[2:32:07] <skyheys> @plagueofgripes You dress em up in coats + armor like a Souls character
[2:32:08] <%spiritofmojave> Yeah Dragoon sets are hard to settle on Eli I agree
[2:32:10] <%Daniel_Is_I> @Remery_ Because beetles are AWESOME
[2:32:11] <%bevyrage> @Remery_ kamen rider maybe?
[2:32:14] <%xWanderingFlame> psaWink
[2:32:17] <@PlagueOfGripes> it has a specific look that nothing combines with
[2:32:17] <zenith0111> @remery_ Because Bugs fighting Dragons is a common motif
[2:32:21] <penitentpentwitch> Good ole BA and Proto Ozma
[2:32:22] <olaksi> The thing to do with DRGlamour is to avoid the heavy armors IMO
[2:32:24] <+fenix122> How to do Eureka content: Don't.
[2:32:24] <Vakojin> Dragoons have spikes everywhere in case they get eaten by a dragon.
[2:32:29] <KeiPrime> cool looking dragoon gear, Hussar's set, Ivalician Uhlan and that's IT
[2:32:30] <KoyaMusa> i use a mix of af4 and 3 that i find works
[2:32:31] <$Dakuu75> that boss is a hentai
[2:32:33] <%spiritofmojave> I always end up going extra casual, but the mail is pretty dope so it feels wrong to
[2:32:40] <saraizarai> Oi, Eureka is great D:<
[2:32:42] <%Daniel_Is_I> I just gave up on making a cool DRG and went slutmog
[2:32:44] <+Grayhammatter> big damage
[2:32:44] <KeiPrime> well aside from drachen
[2:32:47] <+haunt_r> PowerUpL PowerUpL sodaW PowerUpR PowerUpR
[2:32:53] <%Starotter70> I just used the Dragoon armor that you get from the quest line
[2:32:53] <+Remery_> @zenith0111 oh okay, thought that was the only cool armor yall had
[2:32:58] <$QueequegTheater> @PlagueOfGripes Honestly I just stay with the relic set for each expansion and glam the levelling gear until the next relic set
[2:33:00] <Aeonknight_87> Vore boss!
[2:33:07] <SomeOtherNeb> I kind amiss playing 14, I liked destroying my keybarod by mashing as MCH
[2:33:07] <%Metballs> MCH is what I ran E5-8S on, it was a fun time
[2:33:09] <+cawi> MCH is fun cause a lot of button pressing
[2:33:09] <$QueequegTheater> So much DRG gear looks bad
[2:33:11] <ArthurDoyleRPG> Its called Heat Dab, I think
[2:33:18] <%Blackjack760> rip no drill
[2:33:18] <$QueequegTheater> BUT THAT EDEN TANK GEAR THO
[2:33:22] <+Grayhammatter> not the bees!
[2:33:22] <$QueequegTheater> MULLET
[2:33:26] <%Cardz_> Heat dab psaDab
[2:33:28] <%ragingbrachy> the bees NotLikeThis
[2:33:28] <skyheys> crystarium gear syncs well with DRG. the makai drg Arms and legs are real good too
[2:33:32] <@PlagueOfGripes> didn't help to have a female character, which means I must have holes. armor holes
[2:33:34] <+killer_squid1990> Scuffed Rafflesia
[2:33:48] <%WhereIsWill> why mch animations so cool tho
[2:33:52] <zenith0111> @remery_ I'm not a Dragoon player lol
[2:33:52] <+fenix122> Gotta love bosses that have mechanics that have been obsoleted.
[2:33:54] <KeiPrime> well thats your problem, girls cant be dragoons HahaBaby
[2:33:55] <$QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt I tried to play SMN but unfortunately I only have six hands
[2:33:58] <+Ilpala> take for gc seals
[2:34:00] <@SSaryn> GUN
[2:34:00] <%Cardz_> BECAUSE THEY USE A GUN
[2:34:06] <SomeOtherNeb> LUL
[2:34:11] <+Remery_> @zenith0111 oh ok mb
[2:34:12] <penitentpentwitch> Ah, the Seppuku Window of female dragoon armor.
[2:34:14] <+Grayhammatter> they cast GUN
[2:34:14] <%SvenHolgersson> GUNS ARE FOR COWARDS
[2:34:14] <%spiritofmojave> doesn't the drachen armor on women have a belly hole, damn you horny devs
[2:34:20] <JoshWithASpoon> MCH used to be DOGSHIT pre-ShB.
[2:34:21] <OneThousandTomatoes> forgot to use your feet
[2:34:21] <%SvenHolgersson> REAL MEN/WOMEN USE THEIR FISTS
[2:34:21] <%ragingbrachy> why do they have stars
[2:34:21] <$QueequegTheater> TOO MANY BUTTONS
[2:34:21] <+Finaldragoon> greed on them for GC Seals or Desynthing
[2:34:23] <ammobasket> gotta get the foot pedals in there
[2:34:23] <olaksi> SMN rotation is super easy, it's just long
[2:34:23] <onetrueking27> as someone who went from never having touched an mmo before January to clearing savage raids in April, it baffles me how people can be so bad :/
[2:34:24] <+haunt_r> i play red mage :) its nice and chill.
[2:34:24] <%xWanderingFlame> LUL
[2:34:25] <JoshWithASpoon> Well
[2:34:28] <@PlagueOfGripes> it's not enough to fire a gun. you have to twirl around and do a little dance before you aim, to make the bullet stronger
[2:34:29] <zenith0111> Summoner is super easy to play as tho
[2:34:29] <%aslfrasle> 10+ hands are an absolute must for playing SMN.
[2:34:30] <@SSaryn> Shoutouts to 3.x SMNs you're my dudes.
[2:34:33] <+cawi> @PatStaresAt would you want 4 man dungeons with savage or EX difficulty?
[2:34:34] <%spiritofmojave> SMN is FUN
[2:34:35] <+ALazo> Thankfully you can just SCH through SMN
[2:34:35] <+Remery_> must show the tummy
[2:34:37] <JoshWithASpoon> It was bad in Stormblood. I dunno how well MCH was in Heavensward.
[2:34:38] <%GelatinBoi> playing SMN on controller is hhell
[2:34:39] <%spiritofmojave> BUTTONS
[2:34:40] <%WhereIsWill> guuns are great bcuz you keep ppl far and dead, the orb told me so
[2:34:44] <shiibbae> i, a chad BRD main
[2:34:45] <+someyounguy1> does smn get better? it was my first class and i couldnt handle the boring grind around level 50
[2:34:45] <+the22cstomp> machinist was not bad in HW @JoshWithASpoon
[2:34:47] <%ragingbrachy> MCH is all about mashing :)
[2:34:47] <%templar010> SMN rotation is whack
[2:34:51] <skyheys> NIN is all buttons
[2:34:53] <+Jalphole> co
[2:34:55] <%AquilaHarukaze> Remember to feed your egis or they'll eat their actions instead.
[2:34:55] <%Mendin> What class has to hit the fewest buttons?
[2:34:55] <+the22cstomp> mch in HW was really good
[2:34:58] <%Daniel_Is_I> @PatStaresAt Which dps has the fewest buttons?
[2:34:58] <%Dwarven_Gaming> i wish heatblast looked cooler
[2:35:05] <%walternatorz> mash that heat blast and subscribe button
[2:35:05] <Reddhero12> any plans to do savage raids? @PatStaresAt
[2:35:05] <JoshWithASpoon> I couldn't play SMN because of the ludicrous amount of buttons I had to be pressing LuL
[2:35:06] <zenith0111> @gelatinboi Wtf is your setup LUL I think Summoner is super easy on controller
[2:35:07] <$QueequegTheater> Honestly I don't really like the feel of either class, so I stuck with RDM and DRG for the role quests
[2:35:07] <Iwashi94> I wonder, which is the highest APM class?
[2:35:10] <Aydarkzero> hows Red Mage?
[2:35:12] <%ragingbrachy> dancer PogChamp
[2:35:13] <zenith0111> Healing is great on controller
[2:35:14] <olaksi> No
[2:35:15] <saraizarai> BLM and WAR have few buttons
[2:35:16] <%Blackjack760> we smn and mch got god fingers
[2:35:16] <Reddhero12> ninja @Iwashi94
[2:35:16] <%TONYOO101> I miss prebuff ninja where they get to get carpal tunnel in exchange for no dps
[2:35:17] <+Remery_> That's the "shake your ass" class?
[2:35:19] <@PlagueOfGripes> dancer is fun
[2:35:21] <shiibbae> no
[2:35:23] <%kralec> Red maage is just above dancer
[2:35:27] <Aeonknight_87> @Iwashi94 probably NIN or MCH, maybe MNK from speed
[2:35:28] <moosemonkey397> RDM!
[2:35:28] <%spiritofmojave> RDM is pretty up there too
[2:35:28] <penitentpentwitch> And then you run into bad DNC
[2:35:30] <%briktal> oh no I'm doing a level 70 dungeon without the sb job quests
[2:35:31] <Coliaki> I find machinist easier
[2:35:31] <onetrueking27> blackmage also pretty easy if you dont have to move
[2:35:33] <%BunnyEmperor> because DNC is proc based af
[2:35:34] <$QueequegTheater> @saraizarai WAR is a tank, doesn't count
[2:35:36] <%Valdorick> He's lying to you, the real easiest is a Frost Black Mage psaSmug
[2:35:37] <zamzoph> they're probably playing cat or bunnygirls anyway
[2:35:37] <%animaturgy> Or make them play WAR
[2:35:37] <%dekkitout> Does dancer get a big cool sword?
[2:35:38] <%Daniel_Is_I> I play DRG and it's straightforward but it makes my fingers hurt
[2:35:39] <penitentpentwitch> "My Dance Doesn't do damage!"
[2:35:39] <ToBais91> they wouldn't set a dance partner though....
[2:35:40] <+cawi> RDM is fun and easy
[2:35:40] <+the22cstomp> there's bad dancers too
[2:35:42] <KoyaMusa> but pat then they'd not even dance
[2:35:44] <Reddhero12> any plans to do savage raids? @PatStaresAt .
[2:35:45] <%Metballs> *Remembers our dancer for E1-4* Haha, no
[2:35:47] <ColRedyx> @Iwashi94 Bard, ninja and monk are also pretty high.
[2:35:48] <%republicofu> Dancer is 4 button adventure
[2:35:48] <%spiritofmojave> Well I've seen some shit bad dancers Pat LUL
[2:35:49] <Deebo305> I'll be honest, I git SMN down quick while doing role quest but I still don't get SAM not aure why
[2:35:50] <+the22cstomp> bad dancers are really awful
[2:35:50] <+Ilpala> RDM is da bes
[2:35:50] <%plumlungs> just use standard step and everything dies
[2:35:51] <%ragingbrachy> its the only class i can use
[2:35:53] <+starrydragons> I love playing SMN
[2:35:53] <%spiritofmojave> who dont partner
[2:35:57] <KoyaMusa> i have encountered to many dancers that don't even dance
[2:36:00] <zenith0111> Wtf are you guys telling me you have hard time hitting buttons?
[2:36:02] <%Arxel1> Pat, but what about frost only BLM? Kappa
[2:36:03] <zenith0111> I don't understand
[2:36:05] <Reddhero12> savage isnt that hard, it's a lot of fun @PatStaresAt ultimate is the REALLY hard one
[2:36:06] <$QueequegTheater> BLM is super good but feels like GARBAGE to do new dungeons with
[2:36:06] <%GelatinBoi> @zenith0111 probably sub optimal lol especially when trying to actually learn it
[2:36:11] <CurrySauseBandit> So how are healers/tanks these days?
[2:36:11] <+peekaytom> So Pat, when are you progging Ultimate Coil of Bahamut
[2:36:17] <+Jalphole> would it be fast to switch to a healer and lvl from my lv 28 puglist
[2:36:18] <%Dwarven_Gaming> what about ULTIMATE
[2:36:22] <OneAboveAll> hey im a good dancer lol
[2:36:23] <%ShawnTK_> @Arxel1 who the hell is doing that

[2:36:46] <KoyaMusa> moth "i have only 10k gil" man
[2:36:48] <MyriadZen> savage is challenging and fun
[2:36:50] <+Namboto> light rampant can go suck a chode though
[2:36:50] <%shadowace2400> which I DON'T HAVE
[2:36:51] <%TheShal> If what Mothmandraws does you call "Clearing"
[2:36:51] <Manly_BeardedOne> Pat but then you get that 4 dancer Innocence fight we had where we literally couldn't kill the boss. Not even the EX version.
[2:36:52] <+Remery_> Dancers that don't even twerk
[2:36:52] <Reddhero12> @andrewoid_ nah even then its not that bad
[2:36:54] <zenith0111> @gelatinboi Hes easy to learn! Dots + Fester + Cooldowns... THATS IT
[2:36:56] <$DEETRz> shiva is pretty hard even with friends

[2:37:21] <$QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt I don't have friends so I have to PUG any EX or Savage content. So I don't do EX or Savage content
[2:37:22] <%Valdorick> A helpful Dragoon!?
[2:37:23] <%AquilaHarukaze> I always forget which is the stack on this one
[2:37:25] <MyriadZen> need more players like that dragoon
[2:37:27] <%DEETRz> you thought it was WL2 prog but it was me light rampant
[2:37:28] <%Cardz_> Floor tank teaching the normal tank how to play
[2:37:30] <Aeonknight_87> @Deebo305 Neo ExDad is one of the easier raids
[2:37:30] <%TONYOO101> what a champion
[2:37:31] <+Finaldragoon> I mean I can be pretty friendly
[2:37:32] <%spiritofmojave> Nice floor tank :>
[2:37:33] <+peekaytom> yea nowadays pat the level sync doesnt mean new because MSQ gives so much fucking exp
[2:37:33] <+sleeezy> I find if u have a friend who is a red mage you can carry groups pretty easily as well
[2:37:34] <Reddhero12> neo exdeath is savage @Deebo305
[2:37:41] <KoyaMusa> eh, drg could always be an alt who knows. i have an alt that i surprise people with game knowledge
[2:37:46] <%Blackjack760> Light Rampant suckssss
[2:37:46] <KenzBurp> neighborhood friendly dragoon

[2:38:03] <Deebo305> @aeonknight_87 So I hear but groups keep wiping with me
[2:38:05] <+Grayhammatter> nope
[2:38:07] <$QueequegTheater> Hopefully a healer
[2:38:08] <$Dakuu75> Pat, when you get new ppl. Do you explain stufff? Say nothing? or get toxic?
[2:38:08] <%Daniel_Is_I> TIME MAGE
[2:38:09] <penitentpentwitch> Wipe Rampant, and then later on in the fight Wipe Rampant 2: Cosplay Boogaloo
[2:38:09] <ColRedyx> Not yet.
[2:38:10] <+cawi> Light Rampant is a dumb mechanic
[2:38:10] <XyraFhoan> light rampant sucks but I kinda hate knockback mirrors and holy mirrors even more
[2:38:12] <%DEETRz> shiva so worth getting sexy ramuh mount though
[2:38:15] <%CrazyMedicine> Most of dragoons in FF are MVPs of the franchise
[2:38:15] <MonstarGrrrl> is this a monster hunter ?
[2:38:15] <+andrewoid_> please chemist
[2:38:17] <+haunt_r> probably geomancer.. i want puppeteer

[2:38:17] <%BunnyEmperor> beastmaster ?
[2:38:18] <%FutaSnek> *Toph disliked that*
[2:38:18] <%Valdorick> Remember everyone, if you ever want to learn a fight, just play Dragoon. You'll have plenty of time to learn mechanics when you're dead psaSmug
[2:38:18] <ricotez> maybe something with a hammer
[2:38:19] <+someyounguy1> whats wrong with geomancers?

[2:38:25] <watts121> If they include Chemist I'll finally play a healer.
[2:38:26] <ArthurDoyleRPG> Limited
[2:38:28] <Darkrenai> Chemist would be pretty sick
[2:38:28] <Aeonknight_87> @Deebo305 your average group isn't good enough to kill even baby mode raids
[2:38:29] <%Arxel1> Mystic Knight LUL
[2:38:30] <JoshWithASpoon> Geomancer kinda sounds like another shield healer, to be honest.
[2:38:30] <CyborgAV> Fuck it add 2 healers at once
[2:38:30] <+HellCopter> I don't a new healer. My queues !!
[2:38:31] <%AquilaHarukaze> My static has light rampant down but now we're suffering in the add phase
[2:38:32] <%Metballs> I can't wait for a healer that can use wind/earth/water spells
[2:38:33] <+fenix122> In that Geomancer is what they call Astros in Doma.
[2:38:33] <KenzBurp> drug dealer healer
[2:38:36] <%BunnyEmperor> LUL never saw that one happen
[2:38:36] <%republicofu> Rune Knight with a hammer!
[2:38:36] <+the22cstomp> they might both be new
[2:38:36] <zenith0111> It's going to be a 4th healer class for sure
[2:38:37] <%spiritofmojave> I want just ANY new healer
[2:38:38] <%ragingbrachy> but stack on red pat
[2:38:40] <%VHGS> Because you could have just killed the boss instead
[2:38:40] <%WhereIsWill> BEASTMASTER
[2:38:41] <+Felto3> just focus boss lol
[2:38:41] <%Valdorick> HEALER ADJUST
[2:38:41] <%Daniel_Is_I> Time Mage as a healer
[2:38:42] <KidKaiser23> Chemist would go hard in the paint
[2:38:43] <%TheSpartanThief> Ehh, dead boss is dead.
[2:38:44] <%DEETRz> its funny how pf does so many uptime strats like mirrors but we use Ilya which is the worst for uptime
[2:38:47] <KoyaMusa> undeniably a healer, and what type of dps for the second i don not know, probably caster
[2:38:47] <%TheShal> You could have killed the boss before it exploded if you focused it
[2:38:47] <+Finaldragoon> you could have just killed the boss Pat
[2:38:47] <+Felto3> mechanics are for cars
[2:38:48] <+dredgyboi> How does chemist not step on alchemist crafting job?
[2:38:48] <%Ninestempest> if you had hit the boss the boss would have died BEFORE IT WENT OFF
[2:38:50] <%GummiBunnies> GummiBunnies subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 31 months! 
[2:38:50] <%bluefooddye1> ignore mechanic, mash baton
[2:38:52] <saraizarai> I'd like a sword class that's not a tank
[2:38:52] <+Namboto> @Blackjack760 the chain shattering sound for LR is going to show up in my anxiety dreams
[2:38:52] <%Overlordkain> if you stayed on the boss like a champ, it would have died before the blob exploded
[2:38:53] <MyriadZen> most likely geomancer since its mentioned in AST story
[2:38:53] <%Starotter70> Don't worry, just blame the healer
[2:38:54] <SomeOtherNeb> beastmaster/puppetmaster would be dope
[2:38:54] <Scyllas> WE NEED A DAMN NEW HEALER.
[2:38:57] <Aeonknight_87> @Deebo305 baseline competency and looking up how mechanics work is standard
[2:39:00] <KoyaMusa> everyone wanting beastmaster you know its gonna be limited right
[2:39:02] <%Starotter70> Kappa
[2:39:02] <Decahexa> Mathematician!
[2:39:03] <%Blackjack760> Just do Ayatori
[2:39:06] <$QueequegTheater> "We have adjusted the healer role to have more healers"
[2:39:09] <%ShichiNoBushi> New job will be Mascot.
[2:39:12] <%xWanderingFlame> psa1guy
[2:39:13] <+peekaytom> Maybe Pat's the new one to Sohm Al LUL
[2:39:13] <KeiPrime> LOOK at this LOSEr doing MECHANICS
[2:39:17] <CyborgAV> Honestly, same
[2:39:17] <%luftraumm1> chemist as a new healer?
[2:39:18] <penitentpentwitch> A noble sentiment
[2:39:21] <%DEETRz> pf does not do ayatori very often
[2:39:24] <@BigNaturalMan59> ffxi is adding chemist thebetCas
[2:39:27] <ArthurDoyleRPG> Ast killed Chemist and Time Mage doodLUL
[2:39:28] <%ragingbrachy> no
[2:39:29] <%TheShal> Mechanics are for CARS and healers.
[2:39:32] <%TheSpartanThief> You still need mechanics being done right for Sephirot EX, even with Lv 80s.
[2:39:32] <%apolitenoob> Is there anything they could do to make Geomancer not lame in your eyes?
[2:39:33] <%Overlordkain> anyone that runs away from the second ancient flare in CT is a coward
[2:39:34] <Deebo305> @aeonknight_87 competence exist in party finder LUL
[2:39:34] <KenzBurp> new healer and maybe a new class that uses the maiming shit
[2:39:37] <moosemonkey397> NO PAT, you dont understand. we can just kill him before the second ancient flare!
[2:39:38] <%aslfrasle> MECHANICS ARE FOR CARS KUPO
[2:39:38] <%Arxel1> DO COMBO
[2:39:42] <+Finaldragoon> Judge for next expansion
[2:39:42] <+Namboto> @KoyaMusa what about something similar to how summoner works, but for phys damage?
[2:39:48] <%Metballs> >Dungeon mechanics, gotta avoid that 40% raidwide
[2:39:48] <+JerseyBleek> I ran this stupid dugeon 98 times to get the SAM sword to drop
[2:39:49] <%walternatorz> 5 minutes earlier. "You can skip this mechanic, it doesn't do anything"
[2:39:49] <Aeonknight_87> @Deebo305 I never said it did!
[2:39:49] <JoshWithASpoon> But Pat, "Unga Bunga, hit big numbah"
[2:39:55] <%Daxalog> The gun looks like it only fires once but fires many times
[2:39:55] <%WhereIsWill> the ORB ran in front of tank this is HERESY
[2:40:06] <%luftraumm1> blitzballer
[2:40:06] <%alolanslowpoke> alolanslowpoke subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months! Hey Pat! Just wanted to say I love tuning into your FFXIV streams! I've been spending time leveling all my classes to 80, and this stream has given me some good insight. Keep on rockin'!
[2:40:08] <+Grayhammatter> god, fuck those idiots who don't get on the pad during the second anicnet flare
[2:40:11] <%TONYOO101> fuck mechanics, hitting glowing combo buttons are were its at
[2:40:13] <penitentpentwitch> Weird thing is, Geomancer has some overlaps with AST in some of the Stormblood storyline.
[2:40:19] <%mMayrro> sick flips bro
[2:40:26] <KoyaMusa> @Namboto possibly but bst has already been mentioned by the devs to be a potential limited job, it comes from its collection nature
[2:40:31] <%Overlordkain> if it aint dead before the second goes off, you doin it wrong
[2:40:33] <%ragingbrachy> say the thing
[2:40:34] <@BigNaturalMan59> never 4get the pencil
[2:40:39] <%Cactuskris> shoot the GLASS
[2:40:43] <Deebo305> @aeonknight_87 I can barely find people who can place meteors right while farming Tsukuyomi
[2:40:51] <%VioletHeart> Geomancer and Astro derive their power from the same source so I think it's fairly unlikely they'll add Geo. If anything they'll start slotting Geo skills into AST
[2:40:54] <ToBais91> is snapshotting buffs still a think in this game?
[2:40:59] <%xWanderingFlame> Shoot the glass
[2:41:02] <$QueequegTheater> cheer500 God damn it Pat Over/Under is not odds of whether something will happen, it's how many times it will happen. "Over/Under of whether X will happen" is literally ALWAYS 0.5

[2:41:37] <$QueequegTheater> @allbrancook PotD 51-60
[2:41:42] <%SomersaultJustice> machinists like industrial I guess
[2:41:47] <penitentpentwitch> MCH + BRD = DJ
[2:41:52] <%NWR_James> bardchinist
[2:42:03] <penitentpentwitch> MCH + DNC = Rave Dancer
[2:42:09] <%Daxalog> Oh my god the gunner animations.
[2:42:10] <Aeonknight_87> @luftraumm1 PLD DRK WAR GNB for tanks, SAM NIN DRG MNK for melee, BRD MCH DNC for phy ranged, BLM RDM SMN for caster, AST WHM SCH for healers
[2:42:16] <KidKaiser23> psaSkelmo I
[2:42:20] <watts121> Heavensward dragons look like that one dragon you fight in FF9 to power level.
[2:42:31] <zenith0111> I think Mch has the lamest animations tbh
[2:42:38] <+Grayhammatter> eyyyy
[2:42:38] <MyriadZen> what about BLU? Kappa
[2:42:41] <%ragingbrachy> Big Shot
[2:42:49] <shiibbae> INVULN
[2:42:52] <%ShawnTK_> @MyriadZen Doesn't exist
[2:42:52] <shiibbae> OMEGALUL
[2:42:54] <%luftraumm1> @aeonknight_87 I'm actually thinking about all other ff, what could be new classes for xiv
[2:42:55] <%Overlordkain> you should /gpose after using one of the gadget skills to see the weird big multi purpose tool it uses for them
[2:42:56] <+BlackIronVengarl> I wish square gave a fuck about blu
[2:42:58] <Aeonknight_87> that's a limited job =p
[2:42:59] <OneThousandTomatoes> I would love this game and play it all the time if it wasn't subscription based
[2:43:00] <MyriadZen> LUL
[2:43:09] <ricotez> LBs are this game's best USP
[2:43:10] <+Namboto> @zenith0111 haha drill go BRRRRRRR

[2:43:17] <KidKaiser23> Pat keep dat Big Draco on his body
[2:43:32] <zenith0111> @namboto ?
[2:43:32] <watts121> I still don't understand why BLU is a limited class. It would be an amazing normal class.
[2:43:35] <tubit> I play it because it's subscription based
[2:43:42] <Aeonknight_87> @luftraumm1 Chemist, Time Mage maybe, Judge? they don't have to be prior FF jobs. People been screaming for Beastmaster as another limited job
[2:43:45] <+BIumen> Thanks for the PrideWave @sum0kum0
[2:43:46] <Ner234> As someone who knows nothing about FF14 is it possible to explain why Blue Mage is apparently bad? @PatStaresAt
[2:43:49] <%Cardz_> Shot him with a gun
[2:43:54] <%ShawnTK_> if it wasn't subscription based it probably wouldn't be as good as it is
[2:44:05] <%Starotter70> Nice
[2:44:08] <zenith0111> Blue is not bad just not usable like the other classes
[2:44:08] <KoyaMusa> blue mage isn't a full job, it can't do all content
[2:44:09] <%SirGO0SE> nice
[2:44:09] <Aeonknight_87> @Ner234 it's a limited job. made for solo content only, not to play with others
[2:44:12] <@SSaryn> nice
[2:44:14] <%spiritofmojave> Nice
[2:44:18] <JoshWithASpoon> Ner234 It's a "limited job". You can only play it in certain content.
[2:44:25] <+Felto3> because everything blu is good at would have to be cut to make it a balanced normal class
[2:44:28] <+sharpdressedseb_> sharpdressedseb_ subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 1 month streak! 
[2:44:31] <Ner234> @Aeonknight_87 Ah, I see. Thanks

[2:44:39] <%afronooch> always
[2:44:41] <+dredgyboi> its also the nice thing to do
[2:44:42] <%luftraumm1> @aeonknight_87 mostly fft and classic jobs then?
[2:44:51] <+ultimafullmetal> Also it's nice to do
[2:44:52] <$Dakuu75> I thought comedations were just a nice thing to do... like giving a twitter-post a "Like"
[2:44:56] <KeiPrime> man i need toget back in, ive only been doin weekly map runs with my FC
[2:44:59] <%TheSpartanThief> Don't be greedy Pat. People deserve their Dorito Pope clothes.
[2:45:04] <17sevens> I only don't commend people if I feel active comment for all of them
[2:45:04] <%spiritofmojave> There's usually always one person worth commending :)
[2:45:08] <saraizarai> Also plan them, don't want to hit the challenge log on a lvl 16 instead of a lvl78
[2:45:09] <$QueequegTheater> Halo 2 had better gunplay than Half Life 2 haha gottem nerdz
[2:45:11] <%spiritofmojave> at least
[2:45:11] <17sevens> contempt*
[2:45:25] <KeiPrime> use food
[2:45:27] <KoyaMusa> daily clan hunts are good
[2:45:29] <CyborgAV> the FATE challenge logs are good, too
[2:45:35] <%xWanderingFlame> LUL
[2:45:36] <+Finaldragoon> it took me 4 years of playing to receive the 3,000 commendations needed for one of the fat chocobo mounts
[2:45:44] <zamzoph> @PatStaresAt Were you going to talk more about which dailies to keep up on while still progressing on MSQ?
[2:45:50] <zenith0111> But Beast Tribes only from Stormblood right?
[2:45:51] <%xWanderingFlame> psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead
[2:45:54] <MyriadZen> squadron mauals for dungeons if you got em
[2:45:57] <%sharpdressedseb_> Could do the PVP roulette too if you want to have some variety
[2:46:04] <saraizarai> Frontlines is pretty decent
[2:46:06] <ColRedyx> @zenith0111 Every expansion has beast tribes.
[2:46:07] <$QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt So you're saying just keep running PotD 51-60 over and over again
[2:46:07] <olaksi> There's no rhyme or reason to who people commend
[2:46:08] <%spiritofmojave> Beast tribes, Khloe's journals, FATEs
[2:46:08] <OneThousandTomatoes> I just can't justify the price, at least with my current financial situation
[2:46:08] <+peekaytom> potd and hoh are pretty good if you just farm like, the first two sets of floors
[2:46:10] <tubit> Deep Dungeons
[2:46:11] <%ShawnTK_> Daily Frontline gives a decent chunk of EXP
[2:46:11] <%NWR_James> Hey Kids, PatStaresAt say, "Food is good"
[2:46:11] <%luftraumm1> god I got a lot of xp on hunt trains
[2:46:12] <KeiPrime> beast tribes for your current level
[2:46:12] <+Finaldragoon> don't forget spamming 10 guildhests a week if you have nothing else
[2:46:16] <%spiritofmojave> Crafting/Gathering
[2:46:16] <%republicofu> there is more ways to level than there is endgame content
[2:46:17] <%Kaask> i want more
[2:46:20] <KoyaMusa> BAD PLACE
[2:46:20] <%Starotter70> Oh?
[2:46:21] <%ragingbrachy> i dont want more :)
[2:46:24] <+ccwettr123> if you really need that last bit of experience and you're new, exploring every part of a map can actually get you pretty good exp
[2:46:24] <+wabajck> theres cheesing the PVP queue
[2:46:27] <$QueequegTheater> P O T D BAYBEE
[2:46:28] <%animaturgy> Do the beast tribes scale exp? I've only bothered with the fairies

[2:46:44] <%BunnyEmperor> we have to go DEEPER
[2:46:44] <%spiritofmojave> HoH makes me want to kms
[2:46:45] <%sharpdressedseb_> Every beast tribe scales with level
[2:46:50] <%Ninestempest> potd and hoh
[2:46:50] <zenith0111> @colredyx He specified earlier how the expansion tribes give way more exp because they're actually combat tribes unlike the rest
[2:46:50] <+Namboto> I mean, absolute best leveling method is running at level dungeons with friends - provided you have the gear for it
[2:46:51] <Dral54> NO PAT NO

[2:47:27] <Dral54> Its a baaaad idea man
[2:47:36] <KoyaMusa> beast tribe quests scale in hw but up to 60, stormblood goes 60-70, and shb 70-80
[2:47:43] <%spiritofmojave> it's sometimes better just to wait a day for your roulettes to polish off, if you quickly learn HoH/POTD isn't for you

[2:49:09] <penitentpentwitch> If you want to 'Omniclass', a way to keep inventory glut down is to keep all classes that share gear within 10 levels of each other so they are equipped with the same gear. This doesn't supersede previously stated recommendations.

[2:55:01] <%xWanderingFlame> psaGib
[2:55:02] <%ragingbrachy> @RowenCleric but worse somehow
[2:55:04] <Lorenz_Attractor> YES SIR
[2:55:04] <%ConLin_Arts_> you still need to get there first though
[2:55:04] <+Basilias_Maximus> Not Heaven on High?
[2:55:06] <OneThousandTomatoes> I think I heard someone praising this dungeon before
[2:55:06] <%lucaflowe> Jesus fuck it still is!?!?!?!?
[2:55:10] <ManfredA> It scales to where it's useless past 50
[2:55:13] <Thepothero> I love hoh too
[2:55:13] <ManfredA> and sucks just before
[2:55:22] <%ragingbrachy> yes :)
[2:55:25] <+SH1NK1R0> Let it be known that I did both deep dungeons to get every class to cap in prep for shb I had to take a break for a whole month prior cuz I felt my sanity slip
[2:55:27] <%WhereIsWill> or tanks if you dont feel like tanking LUL
[2:55:36] <%animaturgy> Nice for tanks if you're sick of the dungeons in your tier
[2:55:40] <+peekaytom> holy fuck why is your tv so bright
[2:55:40] <Shillk> father do you have a link to the chart?
[2:55:51] <Dral54> They have been spared
[2:56:03] <Aeonknight_87> @OneThousandTomatoes some people love the grind. it's efficient if you want to sit down and grind it w/o worrying about queues. but you don't have to learn how to actually play.
[2:56:09] <KoyaMusa> for healers and tanks, the highest available leveling dungeon is more exp efficient assuming good queues/clear times. dungeons are more exp eff. but for dps you can be waiting a while
[2:56:10] <%R3Roundabout> I had to increase my intake of antidepressents after grinding in this soul sucking piece of shit
[2:56:10] <Cykron> Daddy do you have the chart?
[2:56:12] <%SirGO0SE> oh thats real fast
[2:56:14] <Aeonknight_87> @OneThousandTomatoes it makes more bad players @ max level sooner
[2:56:20] <%Terrah48> Terrah48 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! Finally going to start my final DPS 70-80 tomorrow, unfortunately it's MNK...please pet baby for me to help me feel better about this incoming trauma :<

[2:57:31] <%briktal> at least you get to use higher level abilities in potd
[2:57:32] <%BunnyEmperor> maybe a cherryblossom tree though ShadyLulu
[2:57:33] <OneThousandTomatoes> Didn't they implement well rested xp exactly to avoid that shit
[2:57:38] <%dinnydanny777> It's the labyrinth from Dissidia
[2:57:39] <%Zombino924> there's that mount
[2:57:41] <+Finaldragoon> glamour weapons
[2:57:42] <%SomeSageAdvice> there are the aetherpool weapons for the glams
[2:57:44] <+Basilias_Maximus> There's some minions.
[2:57:46] <KoyaMusa> okay there are rewards but that's not a solo thing to get
[2:57:48] <zenith0111> Dude I'm gonna be honest... the classes in FF14 are pretty easy to learn
[2:57:48] <zamzoph> what about FATES?
[2:57:49] <+fenix122> There's some glamours! ...That you can buy for shit cheap on the marketboard.
[2:57:51] <%miabyte> got it
[2:57:53] <%octavian_gish> sometimes you can get glam stuff to sell on the MB
[2:57:56] <%Nordguy> nothing neat in the horde. pouches?
[2:57:57] <Thepothero> Yep very boring but 40 minute ques are worse pat
[2:58:00] <TioXyco> there's minions and mounts in PotD too
[2:58:00] <+Calern> wrong, if you're a big dick you can get to the end and get 30M worth mounts
[2:58:01] <%SirGO0SE> so its the place to go to get a nice big bump fast
[2:58:07] <$QueequegTheater> HoH
[2:58:15] <tubit> You can get some glam gear that you can sell for a decent chunk
[2:58:16] <Shillk> POtD.......two!
[2:58:19] <%Broand> I got a hat glamour that I liked from it but that's all
[2:58:25] <%BunnyEmperor> the better PotD
[2:58:28] <@JustinianKnight> yes there are plenty of rewards tho
[2:58:29] <%Ranryu692> Pagoda of the dead?
[2:58:32] <TioXyco> AKA Jenga Tower
[2:58:35] <+Grayhammatter> big ass jenga tower
[2:58:35] <chickenhunter> Jenga Tower of the Dead

[2:58:49] <%ragingbrachy> does stormblood have something like this?
[2:58:50] <%WhereIsWill> good haircuts in HoH
[2:58:51] <ManfredA> it's slightly less soulcrushing
[2:58:53] <%Zombino924> one of the worst zones
[2:58:54] <%ragingbrachy> sorry shadowbringers
[2:59:07] <%Zombino924> not yet
[2:59:07] <ManfredA> it will not
[2:59:08] <ManfredA> they said so
[2:59:08] <%Jay_Squirrel> Jay_Squirrel subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months! been subbed for over a year, when do i get pats onlyfans
[2:59:09] <Cedgewik> shb isn't getting one, by the devs
[2:59:09] <TioXyco> @ragingbrachy doesn't and will NOT have one
[2:59:11] <ricotez> shadowbringers also probably won't get one
[2:59:14] <%Zombino924> has trusts though
[2:59:15] <KoyaMusa> also don't forget pat you need to get to floor 100 in potd to unlock hoh
[2:59:16] <Thepothero> Potd helps the 1 to 30 grind so much easier to get yourself a class upgrade
[2:59:16] <%kiiiirsten> Thanks for the PrideHeyyy @jay_squirrel
[2:59:18] <%Laecerelius> shadowbringers does have the trust stuff, though
[2:59:19] <%l3sovikk> Oh shoot, a Pod!
[2:59:25] <%ragingbrachy> ok :)
[2:59:27] <+Felto3> ShB isn't getting deep dungeon, its getting a rancher style content instead
[2:59:32] <%ragingbrachy> i ran so much potd already
[2:59:33] <cherrycottontail> shadowbringers has no hildebrand sidequest either u_u
[2:59:42] <TheFramedWarlock> Newbies can have a little heaven on high, as a punishment
[2:59:44] <%briktal> not 100, just 50 I think
[2:59:44] <+RowenCleric> a rancher style content? whats that mean?
[2:59:47] <Cedgewik> so ungentlemanly
[2:59:57] <+Felto3> no one knows
[2:59:59] <%rumtumtugnutz> you might end up in a lot of HoH's with 4 gunblades tho
[3:00:03] <penitentpentwitch> According to a Dengekionline interview, Yoshi has stated there'll be no Deep Dungeon for Shadowbringers, to save on development resources.

[3:07:17] <shurtal> Is this turning into how to grief your friends in 14?
[3:07:18] <ManfredA> if you have trouble dpsing and healing don't play healer

[3:07:25] <AllenDeadman> I want to get into MMOs, but I feel i'm too stupid and will always fuck up and that gives me anxiety
[3:07:29] <KoyaMusa> you need shadowbringers to play as viera
[3:07:29] <ricotez> you need shadowbringers for buns
[3:07:36] <BinaryShuffle> 分かりません LUL
[3:07:36] <NJigglypuff> @SirGO0SE bunnies are from the shadowbringers expansion

[3:07:38] <%Arxel1> @Broand Yeah, but leves for crafting are BIG XP, for battle classes not so much
[3:07:41] <$QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt My only buddies online are the other subreddit mods and they're bad at FFXIV so I would have to PUG any EX or Savage content, so I don't do it

[3:09:06] <%LadyTheWanderer> i only did trust while doing story
[3:09:14] <penitentpentwitch> Or healer and tank if you've had a real bad set of Roulettes
[3:09:18] <%BunnyEmperor> i only did trust for the achievement
[3:09:20] <+Felto3> i got all trusts to 80, they're so bad
[3:09:24] <%pectusumbra> ...you know I just realized, is this FFV based?
[3:09:24] <KoyaMusa> trust dungeons are always slower than real people though, they are specifically designed to clear content at 30 minutes
[3:09:25] <AllenDeadman> yeah, also some time openers, and rotations are a bit too much to keep in my stupid little head
[3:09:26] <+Remery_> I would trust Pat's big pulls :)
[3:09:28] <tubit> I have played the grand total of one trust dungeon
[3:09:35] <+Finaldragoon> I grinded all the Trusts to 80 for the title, their AI is better than some players
[3:09:39] <$QueequegTheater> Wall pulls baybee
[3:09:44] <%LadyTheWanderer> yep, i always ask
[3:09:46] <Kain5707> always
[3:09:49] <OneThousandTomatoes> experiment with big dick pulls
[3:09:50] <%Valdorick> It doesn't mean, everything from the boss to the next boss
[3:09:51] <Thepothero> Yes trust s are the only way to get the bae yshtola on yer team
[3:09:52] <zamzoph> I just do it and don't ask
[3:09:53] <+Papergelf> wall to wall
[3:09:57] <$RealThiele> dont pull a pile of ranged mobs
[3:09:57] <%plumlungs> big pulls = wall to wall tbhLurk
[3:09:58] <+andrewoid_> wall-to-wall or you're a coward
[3:09:58] <%Metballs> Wall to Walls are the way to go
[3:10:00] <ConBruhh> just do the big pull and if the healer sucks then do it slow
[3:10:01] <+Grayhammatter> always ask, do not be that guy
[3:10:02] <+the22cstomp> wall to wall
[3:10:03] <ColRedyx> Two pulls isn't big dick enough.
[3:10:04] <aeonicvector> Big dick pulls of 3-4 are great tho cause good casters
[3:10:05] <%CJett92> Five is right out
[3:10:06] <%LadyTheWanderer> i usually stick to 2 mobs
[3:10:06] <+lock364> Wall to wall
[3:10:06] <%alolanslowpoke> unless tam tara, then pull boss to boss
[3:10:07] <$QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Imagine not pulling literally everything I can see
[3:10:08] <KoyaMusa> just mitigate man
[3:10:08] <ColRedyx> Go wall to wall
[3:10:10] <%damienlunas> The blue fire doesn't spawn on the upper portions of the deck. The tank is keeping this group in the wrong space.
[3:10:10] <eltigre1296> Wall to wall all the way
[3:10:11] <moosemonkey397> 3 can be hairy
[3:10:11] <%Farples> Wall to wall only
[3:10:12] <%Shady_Squid> "experiment with big pulls" sounds like some anti-drug garbage
[3:10:13] <ManfredA> you can't do real big dick pulls anymore
[3:10:14] <%Daniel_Is_I> HEALER ADJUST
[3:10:14] <$QueequegTheater> No
[3:10:15] <+Remery_> get to show off you big tank penis to the catgirls
[3:10:15] <GhostAnimals> LOS pulls are SO important and knowing how to do them will make things so much easier
[3:10:15] <%Blackjack760> wall to wall nerds
[3:10:17] <ManfredA> only in level 50s
[3:10:17] <+Stay_Knight> Trusts are good when you're playing when almost nobody is on. The time spent with their small pulls is much better than the waiting times if you're no lifing it early in the AM
[3:10:17] <+Felto3> wall to wall, use your immunity
[3:10:19] <%ragingbrachy> pull whole dungeon
[3:10:22] <%dekkitout> Respect your healers, fuckers
[3:10:23] <%Arxel1> THEN PERISH
[3:10:25] <%TheSpartanThief> Trust me Pat, I've been on the Healer end and the Tank end.....no-one cares what the healer thinks.
[3:10:26] <%CappuccinoGuil> Healers decide who lives and dies, don't fuck with them
[3:10:27] <%shadowace2400> arm's length helps, but doesn't guarantee it
[3:10:28] <%SomeSageAdvice> Wall to Wall pulls, you better have the best healer known to mankind
[3:10:32] <%LadyTheWanderer> just fkn run to boss big dick style
[3:10:32] <saraizarai> It's not the enemies that decide whether you live or die, it's the healer
[3:10:32] <$QueequegTheater> Healers deserve all the pain. They made their choice
[3:10:33] <%Metballs> All healers have enough to handle wall to walls
[3:10:41] <penitentpentwitch> Do not wall to wall the beginning of Bardam's Mettle
[3:10:41] <$RealThiele> healers love playing God
[3:10:42] <%Valdorick> Pat "Be kind to your healer" also Pat "HEY TANK, MAKE MY HEALER DO WORK!"
[3:10:44] <+Remery_> I have to impress the bunny girls with my big pulls
[3:10:46] <marshmallowowl> people doin 4 group pulls in anyder
[3:10:48] <ManfredA> also don't pull big in early ARR dungeons
[3:10:50] <ManfredA> noone has AOE
[3:10:52] <+AMaidIndeed> We are all fodder FOR THE BLOOD LILY
[3:10:53] <ManfredA> it's not worth it
[3:10:55] <%Starotter70> I thought that said 'Skinless Stripper'
[3:10:56] <%ragingbrachy> true
[3:10:56] <%SinisterBroccoli> auto crossbow is dope in FF6 too
[3:11:00] <%Daniel_Is_I> Because you put your leyline there
[3:11:00] <ManfredA> except RDM and ranged classes
[3:11:01] <%Arxel1> ASSERT DOMINANCE
[3:11:02] <+PirateKefka> It's about sending a message
[3:11:03] <+Arkfyre> healers adjust
[3:11:03] <%weissguard> @queequegtheater No u Kappa
[3:11:04] <olaksi> Mah uptime
[3:11:04] <%ragingbrachy> DONT HEAL HIM STRIDENT
[3:11:09] <%Tyndarian> just wait for the healer to adjust
[3:11:10] <+Redtaco98> aceuZippo
[3:11:10] <+ccwettr123> different tanks are better at different pull sizes. Warriors can usually pull up to 3 groups without trouble while GNB can struggle with even 2 because they're so squishy
[3:11:16] <ColRedyx> The real advice on pulling big as a tank is pop your biggest cooldown as soon as you stop, and cycle down from biggest CD to weakest. Big ones first because damage ramps down as trash dies, and NEVER WAIT until your HP is low, it's already too late.
[3:11:17] <%TheSpartanThief> @AMaidIndeed BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD LILY
[3:11:17] <BinaryShuffle> Just be sure your healer isn't going to assert dominance
[3:11:28] <+the22cstomp> um actually
[3:11:32] <tubit> The healer class is the one that is easiest to fuck up with. Your entire team will probably wipe if you do as well
[3:11:32] <GhostAnimals> Have you covered the built in Aggro meter yet?
[3:11:33] <+the22cstomp> samurai aoes are 2+
[3:11:33] <tartissimus> some classe can aoe with 2 targets
[3:11:38] <+MisterCrimson> I have this terrible reflex where if a healer volunteers that their new to healing in a level 40+ dungeon, I purposely pull too big to make them feel bad and teach them never to mention that they're new
[3:11:38] <tartissimus> like gunbreaker
[3:11:38] <$RealThiele> Triple flare pew pew pew
[3:11:39] <%Metballs> Some are better on 2
[3:11:39] <%Valdorick> What's that? Always just spam Ice 2?
[3:11:39] <ColRedyx> Dancer uses AOE on two targets, but yes EVERYONE aoes at 3+
[3:11:40] <+Felto3> not always, but sure
[3:11:40] <AllenDeadman> eh fuck it
[3:11:41] <%TamsynRRD> But I thought you had to pull everything between bosses or you didn't know how to play and were bad tank and should uninstall.
[3:11:41] <%LadyTheWanderer> yea i use GNB and im SO SQUISHY
[3:11:42] <aeonicvector> Standing in AOEs is for Blackmages not Gunners, also i think theres a FEW exceptions on the AoEs, like sam
[3:11:42] <+the22cstomp> bard is 2 targets too
[3:11:42] <KoyaMusa> ehhh some circumstances 2 is still enough for aoe
[3:11:45] <+Calern> gnb aoe is better at 2+ already
[3:11:46] <SomeOtherNeb> ello Guvnah
[3:11:47] <+andrewoid_> yeah just check your potencies
[3:11:49] <+Calern> so wrong
[3:11:49] <%BunnyEmperor> depends on the fight
[3:11:55] <+Remery_> @ccwettr123 thanks for the tip just started a month ago on WAR
[3:11:55] <+gaemjurnalist> @SinisterBroccoli 99% of the reason i main mch is because of how amazing auto crossbow was in ff6
[3:11:58] <%goatbait> ok so "Pulling" Os basically drawing aggro?
[3:12:03] <ColRedyx> It depends on the job whether it's 2 or 3 but no job doesn't aoe on 3+
[3:12:10] <SomeOtherNeb> yeah MCH is super satisfying to play, I wsh more people tried it out
[3:12:12] <%ragingbrachy> yes @goatbait
[3:12:15] <+andrewoid_> for instance scholars aoe is 160, broil 3 is 280 so it's better to aoe 2 targets
[3:12:19] <%Nordguy> also, in dungeons, ranged and castee LBs on a Big Pull is the most optimal way to use an LB
[3:12:20] <ManfredA> pulling is aggroing a mob pack
[3:12:21] <%radregice> one time i ran a dungeon with a friend who was healing and the rando tank immediately starting sprinting away from us and pulling big, which got us all killed. my friend called him out for it and the guy's response was "just sprint". don't be that guy
[3:12:23] <ColRedyx> @goatbait Pulling just means starting the fight.
[3:12:24] <tubit> @goatbait yes
[3:12:25] <ManfredA> or the boss
[3:12:34] <AllenDeadman> @PatStaresAt Sorry to bother, but I wonder if there are ways to efficiently learn things like openers and rotations, because half of the time I play an MMO it feels like I'm button mashing on a fighting game and makes me feel like the big dumb
[3:12:35] <+ccwettr123> @Remery_ no prob! I play/ played all the tanks regulary, if you ever have questions, feel free to hit me up!
[3:12:35] <%LadyTheWanderer> mch has robutt thats why
[3:12:40] <+RowenCleric> reeesscue time
[3:12:41] <%ragingbrachy> theres not alot of them to hit at least
[3:12:41] <GhostAnimals> @goatbait Sort of. Pulling means to get the attention of the group. Holding Aggro is something you need to do throughout the fight
[3:12:45] <Dat_Lobo> facepalm* 36 revives during the NIER raid and i only got 1 fecking comm
[3:12:52] <aeonicvector> @radregice did you respond with "just dont die"
[3:13:03] <tubit> pulling means putting one or more mobs from a neutral to an aggroed state
[3:13:04] <ColRedyx> @AllenDeadman thebalanceffxiv
[3:13:05] <ManfredA> that's just MCH
[3:13:08] <%aslfrasle> Big Oops
[3:13:09] <+RowenCleric> dammit Strident come on rescue him
[3:13:10] <%radregice> @aeonicvector pretty much
[3:13:12] <+Remery_> @ccwettr123 okay, tysm this game is really confusing had to back track to get my fell cleave
[3:13:17] <%Noelle_of_the_Nova> @PatStaresAt Running Trusts helped me get better at every role. While I was never bad, having to work with the AI that will not save your ass if you suck and don't know what you are doing forces the player to learn and fucking pay attention.
[3:13:18] <$RealThiele> keeping Enochian active is for chumps
[3:13:26] <olaksi> @Dat_Lobo You let 36 people die? Kappa
[3:13:26] <%Blackjack760> kill him strident
[3:13:27] <%plumlungs> this pull is super fun LUL
[3:13:28] <%TheShal> DO IT COWARD
[3:13:29] <+LtSquid> coward
[3:13:30] <%Starotter70> Do it coward
[3:13:30] <%ClericOfSparda> @AllenDeadman If you're in a Free Company then they usually have training dummies at the FC house for you to practice rotations
[3:13:30] <%walternatorz> this pull is fun
[3:13:33] <%BunnyEmperor> this is a good pull, do it
[3:13:34] <+MisterCrimson> nah, do it, it's not that bad
[3:13:34] <+Grayhammatter> i think he knows
[3:13:35] <+andrewoid_> tank just gotta remember his interrupts then you're golden
[3:13:36] <moosemonkey397> DO IIIIIITTTTT
[3:13:36] <ManfredA> it's fine with good gear
[3:13:37] <KoyaMusa> @AllenDeadman look up the discord server named The Balance, it is a ffxiv server that has rotation info
[3:13:37] <+Remery_> test your limits!
[3:13:39] <aeonicvector> but this pull is REALLY fun if your a BLM
[3:13:40] <%Blackjack760> Do it coward
[3:13:42] <%Zombino924> big pull do good
[3:13:42] <SomeOtherNeb> oh jeez

[3:14:02] <ColRedyx> Show chat the last room in the newest dungeon. THAT'S a big pull.
[3:14:02] <ManfredA> these mobs hit reasonably hard
[3:14:03] <moosemonkey397> LB that shit
[3:14:07] <@SSaryn> This is a legit actual big pull
[3:14:08] <onetrueking27> this is a baby pull XD
[3:14:08] <Strongfish91> PogChamp
[3:14:08] <Thepothero> Big dick pull rooEZ

[3:14:33] <%Ninestempest> ???? ranged can totally do that hello
[3:14:36] <Cedgewik> ya just love to see it
[3:14:36] <%Zombino924> should've used the ranged lb
[3:14:36] <%BunnyEmperor> paid actors
[3:14:36] <ManfredA> no
[3:14:37] <OneThousandTomatoes> shoutcasting
[3:14:38] <%Zombino924> line it up like a hero
[3:14:39] <XyraFhoan> the tank is also using defensive cooldowns, the most underrated part of rando tanks
[3:14:41] <%Farples> Give them that commend
[3:14:41] <ManfredA> Ranged LB sucks
[3:14:43] <%Valdorick> Don't even know to use LB
[3:14:44] <ManfredA> it's the worst of the 3
[3:14:45] <%Farples> He deserves it
[3:14:46] <%heartlesshealer> 👏👏
[3:14:47] <GhostAnimals> It is scary to be the one to use the LB tho
[3:14:48] <%Valdorick> what if I need it next pull!?
[3:14:48] <TheMadBadger> I do this and i get SO much shit for not letting the melee dps using LB2 on the boss.
[3:14:49] <%Arxel1> Just RAW LB ON WAKEUP LUL
[3:14:50] <+Felto3> most of the time the melee gets mad lol
[3:14:51] <ManfredA> it does less damage than the caster one
[3:14:51] <zamzoph> no fear
[3:14:52] <ToBais91> what is the meta for using lbs?
[3:14:53] <%Valdorick> What if it interupts my Ice 3 casting!?
[3:14:54] <KoyaMusa> execpt in alliance raids where they waste the lb that a melee could
[3:14:55] <%MissFantasy> Pog
[3:14:57] <%marsantas> Yeah I'd be scared of being shouted at if i used lb outside of a boss
[3:14:59] <%Blackjack760> range lb sucks
[3:15:01] <onetrueking27> as tank main i just forget lb exists most of the time
[3:15:04] <%ragingbrachy> monkaS
[3:15:08] <ristos237> Ive been yelled at to many times by melees for taking their anime lb moment
[3:15:10] <penitentpentwitch> Be prepared to interrupt the miniboss Pat!
[3:15:13] <%ShawnTK_> @ToBais91 If it's single target Melee everything single time
[3:15:15] <+Remery_> flexing his big tank dick

[3:15:22] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 15m.
[3:15:22] <SomeOtherNeb> "Fleshless Captive" is a dope enemy name
[3:15:22] <+Stay_Knight> Shadowbringers scaling man
[3:15:24] <%SirGO0SE> so much powerful D:
[3:15:26] <%Nordguy> love it when the tank forgets to stun this one
[3:15:28] <ManfredA> @TheMadBadger @marsantas those people are idiots, it's faster to lb big pulls
[3:15:34] <eltigre1296> big dick tank hours
[3:15:41] <KoyaMusa> well pat you can silence
[3:15:42] <GhostAnimals> @ristos237 When the healer "steals" the LB and saves the entire raid
[3:15:42] <+Remery_> girls are watching
[3:15:43] <fockniapo> what is lb?
[3:15:43] <%heartlesshealer> is the fucked lighting some lightning environment stuff?
[3:15:51] <Archmortal> I once used tank LB in the final 2.x patch boss fight for shits and giggles and as it turns out, that's meta for that fight.
[3:15:53] <%ragingbrachy> limit break
[3:15:53] <%Metballs> Limit Break
[3:15:58] <$Dakuu75> wtf is happening with the shadows?
[3:15:59] <%Metballs> Big hit that uses meter
[3:15:59] <+Grayhammatter> yes, it's lightning
[3:16:02] <fockniapo> oh
[3:16:03] <penitentpentwitch> Yup, have to interrupt Seductive scream
[3:16:08] <$Dakuu75> -oh
[3:16:08] <+ragingbrachy> check the top left corner of the screen
[3:16:08] <ristos237> @fockniapo Limit Break, the bar on the top left
[3:16:10] <%SirGO0SE> yeah im seeing that too, i think hes clipping into the enviornment behind him?
[3:16:16] <ManfredA> also if you're ranged dps or tank you can silence things with the weird orange bar around their skill
[3:16:17] <%ClericOfSparda> LB is limit break. There's a bar up top that fills up to let you use it
[3:16:17] <%heartlesshealer> thanks @Grayhammatter
[3:16:19] <%SirGO0SE> oh its lightning
[3:16:26] <TheMadBadger> @ManfredA Oh, I know. I'm a caster main. It just sucks that loads of people think that melee LB2 on the boss is better than AoEing a big pull
[3:16:43] <%ragingbrachy> SourPls
[3:16:52] <ManfredA> they sound like the idiots who save it for the last 3% so they can finish it
[3:16:54] <+Grayhammatter> SourPls
[3:16:55] <@JustinianKnight> *usually
[3:16:55] <%BunnyEmperor> or they just didn't toggle the option Pat...
[3:16:56] <$Dakuu75> hey man, I like those cut cenes
[3:16:56] <+Ilpala> oh this one had some fun mechanics
[3:16:58] <%Blueangrey> Blueangrey subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[3:16:58] <ManfredA> which is an actual waste
[3:17:00] <+RowenCleric> best dungeon boss music
[3:17:14] <KoyaMusa> hot shot pat
[3:17:25] <tubit> twinning best boss music
[3:17:34] <ManfredA> if anyone gets mad at you as a caster for lbing a pull they're bad at video games
[3:17:36] <%Blackjack760> ^^
[3:17:37] <ManfredA> tell them I said it
[3:17:38] <$Dakuu75> "ramble ramble ramble" lol
[3:17:43] <olaksi> I remember melee LBing on <5% boss in the Nier raid, then everyone decided to eat shit all at once and yell at me for wasting the party revive
[3:17:45] <Strongfish91> SourPls
[3:17:46] <%radregice> 3.4 boss theme is my fave tbh
[3:18:02] <%Cactuskris> best boss dungeon theme?
[3:18:14] <%Blackjack760> twining
[3:18:16] <ManfredA> if you LB a boss that's nearly dead and everyone dies that's on them not you
[3:18:20] <%ragingbrachy> god damn that lalafell is small
[3:18:27] <%LaughingCatt> no one remembers Hot Shot until it becomes Air Anchor, cause its got such a piddly animation
[3:18:29] <%ShawnTK_> @olaksi don't waste the party revive next time Kappa
[3:18:37] <%heartlesshealer> 👏
[3:18:38] <Reddhero12> your uptime is really good, I bet you'd be really good at savage if you ever gave it a shot. You're much better than most players I see @PatStaresAt

[3:18:43] <+Grayhammatter> strident almost got ya LUL
[3:18:48] <tubit> haha, I legit didn't notice the lala
[3:18:56] <ManfredA> being a lala is a totally different experience
[3:18:59] <%Starotter70> @ragingbrachy Yeah, and so is the party member
[3:19:00] <ManfredA> you're so tiny
[3:19:10] <penitentpentwitch> "We shall go together!"
[3:19:15] <$Dakuu75> yeah, I've seen youtube videos of that. it's pretty good
[3:19:20] <%Broand> his character is too manfred
[3:19:20] <+redbluedevil1> my friend plays healer and tank and tries to shirk or rescue me to kill me

[3:21:58] <%miabyte> I love turning my brain off. Some people say it's one of my best qualities.
[3:21:59] <+Finaldragoon> @wix964 don't joke about that

[3:23:39] <+RowenCleric> this is such a good dungeon
[3:23:41] <%ragingbrachy> thats kinda funny
[3:23:41] <%Jay_Squirrel> dang you said it before i coul
[3:23:41] <ManfredA> she wants to help you

[3:23:44] <ManfredA> that's the canon reason
[3:23:45] <Who_lio42> can I be LB?
[3:23:45] <%BunnyEmperor> I hate that

[3:23:51] <%briktal> is LB a pro smash player
[3:23:54] <BitBolt> Why are your party members so tiny?
[3:23:54] <ricotez> this dungeon is the "fuck you, you're on the First now" dungeon

[3:24:02] <+Remery_> can't stop blowing
[3:24:07] <tartissimus> thnakred fukin SKIPS THE TIGHTROPE ON THE BOSS
[3:24:10] <%heartlesshealer> Okay, that's kinda cute how they have playstyles
[3:24:11] <olaksi> Big stronk attitude
[3:24:16] <%Daxalog> Can you exclusively use these things everywhere?
[3:24:17] <Aydarkzero> y no aoe?
[3:24:17] <Archmortal> Important point, if you try to be a smartass and force big pulls with Thancred tanking, you'll probably wipe
[3:24:19] <ManfredA> Y'shtola does but only half the time
[3:24:21] <%radregice> trust dungeons are slow as fuuuuck
[3:24:21] <Animal_Farm4> They suck at dpsing things. This dungeon takes like 40 minutes with them LUL
[3:24:24] <penitentpentwitch> Good ole Limp Bizkit
[3:24:25] <%ragingbrachy> aoe is not big number
[3:24:27] <tubit> Yikes
[3:24:28] <%marsantas> There has to be a downside or no one would ever queue agian
[3:24:30] <%NopeBadguy> they will also STOP their rotation during mechs
[3:24:31] <%ChrisPlaysThing> You know what sucks? I flowers for Aldranon-ed my enjoyment of MMO RPG games when i worked on one for FQA for 2 years.
[3:24:31] <TioXyco> you can make them big pull tho,
[3:24:31] <%BunnyEmperor> Yshtola has an AoE though
[3:24:32] <KoyaMusa> so yeah trust runs take 30 minutes, the ai calculates dps you do and adjust appropriately
[3:24:36] <+MaddyCaddy> Can't believe the Scions sandbag speedruns
[3:24:41] <wix964> if they just added an aoe rotation to these damn bots, the pain would be so much less
[3:24:42] <%Valdorick> Gotta pay the Time cost for having NPCs
[3:24:54] <+Finaldragoon> Ryne will never use LB. I don't know if there is a way to make her LB, but I haven't found it
[3:24:55] <+Rose_Silvers> @PatStaresAt scatter should be your dual cast on aoes
[3:24:59] <Animal_Farm4> The ideal 2 target on RDM is just jolt impact
[3:25:00] <%TheSpartanThief> They also don't interweave their skills, which ALSO is bad.
[3:25:05] <Wookeh_> they lower their dps if you shred, to keep dungeon run times pretty consistant
[3:25:11] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Something about being on the balance team and having 6 builds nerfed into oblivio made me have nothing left to give
[3:25:19] <%Kaask> they also dont cast or do anything while avoiding aoe
[3:25:19] <%SWFanatic> SWFanatic subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 14 months, currently on a 1 month streak! Hi Pat. (You're Pat) Been playing some Warzone, got my first duo win the other night. My favorite moment so far has been accidentally RPGing a tree I was using for cover while I was trying to blow up a passing Jeep. Keep on keepin on.
[3:25:25] <Archmortal> You trade queue wait times for dungeon speed
[3:25:26] <%heartlesshealer> Thanks for the PridePenguin @swfanatic
[3:25:31] <%SinisterBroccoli> Wookeh_ is that true?
[3:25:36] <NeonBleu> I did one dungeon with them and never again
[3:25:46] <skyheys> it does
[3:25:47] <%SWFanatic> @heartlesshealer yw
[3:25:48] <%ragingbrachy> ew
[3:25:52] <KoyaMusa> that is true, their dps increases as well if you slack
[3:25:55] <%briktal> I think the devs talked about them doing that before release
[3:25:55] <@JustinianKnight> I've heard that but not sure if actually true
[3:26:06] <%ChrisPlaysThing> That would be interesting data to pull from logs
[3:26:07] <tubit> @NeonBleu yup, same
[3:26:12] <$Dakuu75> that sounds like some horrible conspiracy shit
[3:26:12] <+Finaldragoon> if you do absolutely nothing, a Trust run will take 40 minutes maximum
[3:26:15] <ricotez> it's so weird to see everyone at like 40k health at 71 when every role goes past 100k at 80
[3:26:21] <%BunnyEmperor> I never noticed a difference
[3:26:21] <ToBais91> would you say its a decent way to gain muscle memory on a new dps? like a training dummy that is useful?
[3:26:24] <moosemonkey397> i dont have AACT, but ive heard that as well
[3:26:24] <@JustinianKnight> you still want to do well tho or it will take longer

[3:26:43] <%Agami23> or if your a huge nerd and want to go slowly and look around alot
[3:26:44] <Wookeh_> @SinisterBroccoli not 100%, but they seem to hit harder as well if you do less damage
[3:26:46] <tubit> Don't you get less drops in trust dungeons
[3:26:47] <CyborgAV> The minions and other drops can happen, too
[3:26:47] <%Robot_Nixon_> @sashagreenspiderqueen PogChamp
[3:26:49] <ManfredA> not having scatter is embarrassing
[3:26:51] <%BunnyEmperor> or orchestrion rolls
[3:26:53] <+blakraign> Thanks for the PrideFlower @sashagreenspiderqueen
[3:26:53] <%ClericOfSparda> Do it for the glams!
[3:26:53] <ColRedyx> When you run with trusts the chests aren't guaranteed to spawn.
[3:26:54] <+RowenCleric> great to learn the dungeon too
[3:26:54] <SweetCuppingCake> I love the song for this dungeon
[3:26:55] <%SwdVengeance> psaMenace psaMenace psaMenace
[3:26:56] <%YakumoYomi> Fuck all that. Tell me about those giant polar bears.
[3:27:00] <+MisterCrimson> @Rose_Silvers scatter is gone. It was replaced by Impact
[3:27:01] <ColRedyx> You sure?
[3:27:01] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> @PatStaresAt the world fuckin sucks right now gamers especially thanks for not bein a FUCK you wholesome goblin
[3:27:01] <@JustinianKnight> yes
[3:27:02] <%PlayingChello> yes you do
[3:27:03] <+Rose_Silvers> pat where is your scatter button
[3:27:07] <%ClericOfSparda> Yes
[3:27:07] <%Metballs> You do
[3:27:09] <+Finaldragoon> yes you do
[3:27:09] <Archmortal> You absolutely get less drops
[3:27:09] <%PlayingChello> you get one drop per chest instead of 2
[3:27:10] <%Blackjack760> yes
[3:27:11] <skyheys> You get fewer drops
[3:27:12] <@JustinianKnight> but YOU will get it
[3:27:12] <tartissimus> scatter is gone, replaced
[3:27:12] <moosemonkey397> they do drop less, but on average more
[3:27:13] <%walternatorz> good way to learn mechanics too
[3:27:15] <%Cardz_> I remember getting the minion my first time running this with trusts, was nice
[3:27:15] <DiscoNinjaWolf> you do get less
[3:27:16] <%ClericOfSparda> You get one chest instead of two
[3:27:18] <moosemonkey397> YOU get more
[3:27:18] <Animal_Farm4> Scatter becomes impact
[3:27:19] <+Auriel_Astrum> You get half of the boss drops
[3:27:19] <+Finaldragoon> boss chests have 1 gear instead of 2
[3:27:19] <KoyaMusa> pat loves lying today
[3:27:20] <+ccwettr123> @PatStaresAt wouldn't that make trusts godlike for desynth?
[3:27:20] <@JustinianKnight> its 1 less
[3:27:21] <moosemonkey397> but overall less
[3:27:22] <%ClericOfSparda> But its guaranteed
[3:27:22] <%BunnyEmperor> lvl 15 Pat
[3:27:23] <%SWFanatic> Bye Pat. I must go now.
[3:27:23] <+AMaidIndeed> you do, bosses only give one item as oppose to two
[3:27:24] <Reddhero12> @YakumoYomi they're bursting with light aether, their cells are being ripped apart so they're basically zombies now
[3:27:27] <%radregice> scatter is impact
[3:27:27] <+Grayhammatter> it's impact
[3:27:28] <%LaughingCatt> Scatter turns into Impact
[3:27:29] <%Blackjack760> it's imoact
[3:27:30] <Byr0nX> crazy taaaaaalk
[3:27:33] <olaksi> You aren't sharing with 3 other ppl though
[3:27:34] <%maenos2> i just glanced back at the tv, man pat is reclining something fierce
[3:27:36] <Dral54> you get 1 instead of 2, but its guaranteed
[3:27:37] <%MaddyCaddy> Why do you have so many addles and sure cast?
[3:27:38] <Reddhero12> @YakumoYomi they're called sin eaters
[3:27:43] <%Invlux> Pat is full lounged now
[3:27:44] <+Rose_Silvers> ah okes i forgot about that change
[3:27:45] <+ALazo> You get less drops as a whole but you don't have to compete with the group, so you end up getting about the same/more.
[3:27:48] <zenith0111> Best AOE rotation is Magic 2 > Impact
[3:27:51] <ManfredA> oh right I've barely played ShB RDM
[3:27:56] <Aydarkzero> Red Mage looks cool to play
[3:27:58] <$QueequegTheater> Man RDM might not be as good but it just feels so much more fun than BLM or SMN
[3:27:58] <%Blackjack760> no
[3:28:03] <%NopeBadguy> rdm has a ton of shifting buttons
[3:28:05] <%SinisterBroccoli> Red mage is great
[3:28:06] <ManfredA> @Aydarkzero it's uh
[3:28:08] <ManfredA> not
[3:28:08] <Thalchampz> redmage is cool
[3:28:08] <penitentpentwitch> Yoshi P mentioned in an April 10th interview that Trusts calculate the damage and adjust to keep run times consistent.
[3:28:11] <+Rose_Silvers> pat have you beaten the savage raid tier yet?
[3:28:13] <%briktal> red mage is f2p fun to play
[3:28:18] <ManfredA> RDM is very tight and intuitive
[3:28:19] <%thegreatbambe> more like REZMAGE amirite
[3:28:20] <+snausages_> SMN best caster big dick dps
[3:28:21] <ManfredA> but it's very boring
[3:28:23] <%ClericOfSparda> This is also a good way to get used to rotations in simulated play, as opposed to the training dummy.
[3:28:25] <%Valdorick> You're not playing PERFECTLY!? How quaint. psaBougie
[3:28:27] <Thalchampz> pat doesn't savage if i recall
[3:28:34] <ColRedyx> @Rose_Silvers He doesn't even try savage.
[3:28:37] <TheMadBadger> RDM is very intuitive and very flashy. You literally have a meter telling you what to do next in your rotation
[3:28:39] <TioXyco> yeah, pat doesn't savage
[3:28:40] <+Grayhammatter> those moulinets
[3:28:43] <%MaddyCaddy> Unfortunate
[3:28:44] <wix964> SMN best mage cuz BIG DARGON & FIREBIRB
[3:28:44] <%ragingbrachy> dont you want the gauges to be skewed to one side?
[3:28:45] <tartissimus> with 90 you can go with 4 moulinets
[3:28:46] <Reddhero12> pat would be good at savage FeelsBadMan
[3:28:48] <%MaddyCaddy> This savage tier is really fun
[3:28:49] <+snausages_> I used the trusts to learn samurai rotation after getting lvl skip
[3:28:49] <gatoralus> i love the concept of RDM but i get bored
[3:28:50] <%ragingbrachy> no
[3:28:50] <ManfredA> you basically have the same rotation at 80 as you do at 50
[3:28:55] <ManfredA> just with extra buffs and whistles
[3:29:00] <zenith0111> I carried a dungeon as a Red Mage with my just my Tank after our healer and dps died
[3:29:08] <aeonicvector> not bad, but dont forget to weave in engagement
[3:29:12] <$QueequegTheater> Can you put all SMN's buttons on just the two Xbars for controller?
[3:29:15] <aeonicvector> since its a non channel
[3:29:21] <ManfredA> yes
[3:29:23] <%SinisterBroccoli> Are trusts still good for odd numbers?
[3:29:24] <%ClericOfSparda> Savages are hard to organize and the current run is total BS. E5S and E8S are ridiculous
[3:29:27] <%Blackjack760> yes
[3:29:28] <ColRedyx> @QueequegTheater Yeah, you can do that for every job.
[3:29:31] <$QueequegTheater> Because that's a huge dealbreaker for me
[3:29:33] <+Rose_Silvers> @QueequegTheater yeah
[3:29:34] <olaksi> Hey its Traileriel
[3:29:35] <%ragingbrachy> SourPls
[3:29:36] <Strongfish91> SourPls
[3:29:39] <ColRedyx> @QueequegTheater No job has more than 32 buttons.
[3:29:40] <%MaddyCaddy> E5S isn't bad
[3:29:41] <ricotez> Forgiven Dissonance is the greatest villain in ShB, change my mind
[3:29:42] <%BunnyEmperor> the best thing abou this raid tier is Twice Stricken because that song slaps
[3:29:43] <neVan0> SourPls
[3:29:43] <KoyaMusa> ah yes the boss theme that now plays in every dungeon fight, good
[3:29:46] <+Finaldragoon> SourPls
[3:29:48] <%MaddyCaddy> E8S though is awful to prog
[3:29:49] <%Starotter70> SourPls
[3:29:49] <Reddhero12> e5s is crazy easy, i just had my friend literally do it first try last night when i told him the mechanics @ClericOfSparda
[3:29:51] <wix964> wait, they've changed the boss theme?!
[3:29:51] <+snausages_> You can do it with the cross bar thing where you push both buttons at once
[3:29:52] <+the22cstomp> E5S isn't hard at all
[3:29:55] <+Grayhammatter> SourPls
[3:29:55] <+MisterCrimson> Verflare Gang here
[3:29:55] <Arex_Korudo> SourPls
[3:29:56] <Darkencide> SourPls
[3:29:57] <ristos237> SourPls
[3:30:01] <+the22cstomp> it's really braindead easy
[3:30:06] <+Arkfyre> I love the little spin yuo do when you cat verholy
[3:30:08] <%Metballs> E5S is a joke
[3:30:10] <%demon_shadowplays> hey pat any reason why the gane audio is so low?
[3:30:15] <KoyaMusa> yes, every single shb dungeon boss has insatiable playing, nothing else
[3:30:19] <ManfredA> verflare is baby flare
[3:30:21] <ManfredA> it's so pitiful
[3:30:26] <%FutaSnek> This track FUCKING SLAPS
[3:30:27] <ColRedyx> Yeah that's why you form a static instead of driving yourself insane in PF.
[3:30:28] <%FutaSnek> SO HARD
[3:30:38] <$QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt I like how every tank has some serious reason to explain how their defense works, but then WAR is just like "What if big fucking ax"
[3:30:49] <%miabyte> miabyte gifted a Tier 1 sub to Rozalyndis! 
[3:30:51] <%miabyte> miabyte's Gift shared rewards to 5 others in Chat! 
[3:30:54] <tartissimus> this music is MILES BETTER thjen the classic arr for every midboss
[3:30:57] <ManfredA> too angry to get hurt
[3:30:58] <tubit> This dungeon is a big step up from the previous one in every respect, imo
[3:31:04] <%miabyte> Gotta boucne. Thanks for the tips.
[3:31:06] <olaksi> IDK if this is the best battle theme in the series but it's up there
[3:31:06] <ArthurDoyleRPG> Red Mage lacks impact mostly for me
[3:31:09] <%miabyte> bounce*
[3:31:09] <%FutaSnek> Like I'd want this track in other games its so good
[3:31:11] <%Cardz_> WE FAAAALLL
[3:31:14] <%dinnydanny777> Did you just use summon swords?
[3:31:25] <ManfredA> this is in another game
[3:31:30] <TheMadBadger> Yes, that's what RDM does
[3:31:32] <ManfredA> this is the Dissidia version of the ShB boss theme
[3:31:36] <TheMadBadger> You use sword magic
[3:31:37] <+ccwettr123> @dinnydanny777 RDM is Zorro + Virgil
[3:32:03] <+snausages_> Does Pat ever play healer?
[3:32:03] <%dinnydanny777> I really wish there was another Dissidia game like the ones on the PSP
[3:32:04] <aeonicvector> @PatStaresAt if you can afford the manual runs, use engagement, it dosent interrupt like flechette
[3:32:13] <Ultimatefool> God I wish the Trusts did more damage
[3:32:13] <olaksi> The duelist aesthetic was a good call for RDM
[3:32:14] <%derrickslays> notice how pat is more relaxed playing ffxiv
[3:32:19] <KoyaMusa> yeah but its a dps loss
[3:32:21] <%TheShal> Yeah, but it does less damage
[3:32:22] <@JustinianKnight> I too wish Dissidia was good again
[3:32:23] <$QueequegTheater> Red Mage is Yoshi-P watched Legend of Zorro after beating DMC3
[3:32:25] <tartissimus> less potency and no dash back
[3:32:27] <+cawi> it has less potency but its a melee attack
[3:32:29] <Thalchampz> ffxiv is comfytimes
[3:32:37] <aeonicvector> @KoyaMusa its a DPS gain, its a skill not a spell
[3:32:42] <TioXyco> very comfytimes
[3:32:43] <+SH1NK1R0> One has to be higher than the other to proc the passive on ver holy /flare
[3:32:43] <KoyaMusa> so see, just about 10 minutes
[3:32:46] <aeonicvector> less power, but can weave during cooldowns
[3:32:51] <+MisterCrimson> and then there's Scorch which makes me wet
[3:32:53] <+Grayhammatter> we comfy bois
[3:33:07] <KoyaMusa> @aeonicvector not compared to the dash back, which with it shares a cooldown
[3:33:10] <ManfredA> I agree with the guy who said RDM lacks impact
[3:33:16] <%derrickslays> no more comfy
[3:33:16] <%Metballs> Scorch has a really powerful animation, I love it
[3:33:17] <ManfredA> their sound design is pretty weak
[3:33:20] <%heartlesshealer> fight burd
[3:33:21] <%ragingbrachy> moolinets
[3:33:29] <HungryHungryEmu> how do you deal with a maxed out character armoury? is there a chest somewhere?
[3:33:34] <penitentpentwitch> Honestly trusts as a DPS can be good for reading chat, outside of boss fights you rarely have to watch out for AoEs
[3:33:40] <aeonicvector> dash back is 20 more power, but also has the length of the displacement and cant be used mid spell combos without losing dps
[3:33:43] <Ultimatefool> Are Red Mage's move actual French or fake French
[3:33:48] <+Stay_Knight> Retainers
[3:33:50] <ManfredA> @HungryHungryEmu shove it in your glamour chest if it's for glamours, cry if it's not
[3:33:51] <SweetCuppingCake> Pat, did you ever end up leveling black mage?
[3:33:58] <ColRedyx> @HungryHungryEmu Level other jobs to at least 50.
[3:34:05] <tubit> For some reason every RDM wants to jump to the opposite end of the boss arena when I heal
[3:34:15] <%ragingbrachy> do it :)
[3:34:16] <%heartlesshealer> rip farmers
[3:34:19] <XileElekt> @XileElekt is new here. Say hello! HeyGuys
[3:34:20] <%Starotter70> psaBougie
[3:34:23] <%heartlesshealer> dead forever
[3:34:25] <SweetCuppingCake> Yeah! Black mage is pretty great at 80. Hate syncing back down to 50 though
[3:34:25] <%ClericOfSparda> GC Seals!
[3:34:27] <$QueequegTheater> @tubit Because it's stylish
[3:34:34] <+snausages_> good black mage players are like Vergil
[3:34:35] <XileElekt> Is this pat from best friends play???
[3:34:36] <+MisterCrimson> @Ultimatefool their melee attacks are named after fencing maneuvers so it is real frnech and Pat is being Pat
[3:34:39] <+snausages_> All teleporting and shit
[3:34:40] <uncledoodsauce> ja rule doesn't know about the stream
[3:34:50] <$QueequegTheater> @XileElekt No this is DarkSydePat
[3:34:50] <ricotez> no, this is the krusty krab
[3:35:12] <%Bailey__gaming> hi everyone
[3:35:14] <+SpaceHobo55> I got my RDM to 77, just a few more
[3:35:21] <+MisterCrimson> @XileElekt not anymore doodSad
[3:35:27] <%BunnyEmperor> Deathflare is the best
[3:35:28] <%VioletHeart> Scorch tho
[3:35:29] <TheMadBadger> Verholy looks so much better than Verflare
[3:35:29] <ManfredA> my biggest problem leveling RDM is boredom
[3:35:33] <%Starotter70> Hey Bailey
[3:35:34] <+ecolli37108> man, i wanna do trusts, but it just feels so slow and boring when i get into them
[3:35:35] <XileElekt> @QueequegTheater edgy :D
[3:35:35] <olaksi> Reminds me of SNES FF animations
[3:35:36] <DarkCloud79> Wait, why does Pat have so many fully spiritbonded equipment? Why doesn't he extract the materia?
[3:35:42] <+shapeforn> So, honest question here, I played about 3 years ago, and just did not find any class/job whose combat felt engaging. Granted, I never maxed out any of them, but I played quite a lot. I mainly play BDO, so is my palate just soiled forever?
[3:35:43] <uncledoodsauce> where's ja rule?
[3:35:44] <aeonicvector> @KoyaMusa "Engagement is 50 less potency than Displacement, however it can be double weaved and has no animation lock whatsoever."
[3:35:49] <$QueequegTheater> @ManfredA Well yeah, that's every DPS
[3:35:53] <ArthurDoyleRPG> It's a discount Akh Morn doodLUL
[3:35:57] <ManfredA> nah
[3:36:01] <ManfredA> other DPS feel fun to play
[3:36:08] <+Grayhammatter> verflare is kinda meh
[3:36:09] <SweetCuppingCake> @DarkCloud79 You just reminded me that we can extract materia now lol
[3:36:13] <ManfredA> RDM is just boring as a class design because it's so function over form
[3:36:18] <$QueequegTheater> RDM is way more fun than BLM or SMN
[3:36:19] <%gespenst25> @PatStaresAt do you use your RDM off GCD spells after your hard cast or after your dual cast spell?
[3:36:22] <zenith0111> My fun is better than your fun
[3:36:41] <XileElekt> BLM > RDM for fun imo
[3:36:42] <TioXyco> the healers are the leader. they decide if the tank lives or not
[3:36:47] <Animal_Farm4> It clips if you try to fit it in between dualcasts
[3:36:49] <%Metballs> You don't want to clip
[3:36:51] <griffemto> @PatStaresAt do you do savage content?
[3:36:51] <DarkCloud79> Pat so much money he doesn't care about materia
[3:36:52] <tubit> BLM didn't get fun for me until waaay up in the levels
[3:36:56] <%ogtrashwizard> Hey Pat, quick question. What controller are you most partial to? I see you use both the XB and PS controllers, but there's more designs out there.
[3:36:58] <%MaddyCaddy> Not in my raid group
[3:37:00] <ColRedyx> @gespenst25 You should not be using them after the hardcast, only the dualcast, Pat's just playing casually.
[3:37:00] <ManfredA> consider this: RDM is basically the same class it is at 50 as it as 80, just with some minor changes and extra buttons
[3:37:05] <XileElekt> Healers who think they are the leader are the worst kind of people
[3:37:10] <ManfredA> BLM changes wildly between each 10 levels
[3:37:15] <%MaddyCaddy> Healers sure do love Glare and Ruin
[3:37:16] <@SSaryn> And if you're a NIN, especially never clip.
[3:37:16] <%radregice> i used to be all about RDM for so long but level 80 SMN is too good
[3:37:16] <ManfredA> from 50 to 60 to 70 to 80
[3:37:24] <@SSaryn> Or Rabbit like I do.
[3:37:26] <%dinnydanny777> Is that a Carbuncle?
[3:37:29] <@SSaryn> Cause I'm bad..
[3:37:31] <Rellim80> Yip yip
[3:37:34] <+SpaceHobo55> ROLE WAR!!!!
[3:37:38] <aeonicvector> @ManfredA blasphemy, the mana charge combos at 60 are way different then 50, and 70 to 80 is all about finishers and double weaves
[3:37:43] <Otobiworldo> Have you leveled your Squadron
[3:37:48] <%BoneofMalkav> But can she do the psaBig psaDab
[3:37:50] <penitentpentwitch> It is nice they have their own flavor text per dungeon
[3:37:50] <%isolex_> isolex_ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months! happy 8 months goblin lord! Thanks for getting me into this wonderful game. i finally hit ShB content and holy shit the quality jumped hard.
[3:37:52] <ManfredA> new Ninja is great
[3:37:58] <aeonicvector> mostly cause manafication to get the 1.5 melee combos
[3:38:00] <Reddhero12> @aeonicvector compared to how much black mage changes it's pretty pathetic
[3:38:03] <%Cardz_> Oh hi tesleen
[3:38:06] <%twoto858> Is there any particular class that's more difficult to level up first, or do you just pick a favorite?
[3:38:06] <%radregice> guys, guys. the leader of any given party is whoever has the highest level culinarian
[3:38:07] <olaksi> Just because the frontline will fall without supply lines doesn't make the truck drivers army leaders
[3:38:07] <%Blackjack760> @ssaryn we all rabbit simetumes
[3:38:11] <tubit> Poor poor Tesleen BibleThump
[3:38:14] <%ragingbrachy> 🎸
[3:38:15] <%gespenst25> BibleThump
[3:38:15] <+cawi> I might use trusts to farm bonewicca gear.
[3:38:20] <Darkencide> SourPls
[3:38:21] <+Grayhammatter> this track slaps
[3:38:23] <aeonicvector> @Reddhero12 ok sure, but black mage gets TRIPPLE CAST and LEYLINES
[3:38:24] <+Ilpala> Man the first time this boss hit ;_;
[3:38:25] <+RowenCleric> best part about SMN/RDM is they share equipment and materia so I can switch off if I get bored of one
[3:38:25] <neVan0> SourPls
[3:38:35] <cherrycottontail> :-( Tesleen....
[3:38:36] <wix964> Oh look, it's the horror installment of this xpac
[3:38:42] <%dinnydanny777> Grind on this woman from the start of Shadowbringers lmao
[3:38:42] <XileElekt> @radregice what if two ppl are both max lvl?
[3:38:45] <ManfredA> @twoto858 most classes are fairly simple to pick up, I recommend you don't level BLM first because their approach to combat design is wildly different from others
[3:38:57] <%MaddyCaddy> The leader of any party is the person who does the callouts. That's just the facts.
[3:39:04] <ManfredA> BLM doesn't like to move ever
[3:39:05] <%ClericOfSparda> Pat refuses to use ACT
[3:39:09] <%Bailey__gaming> @patstaresat my fave wow classes were Warlock & Paladin, which 14 class would you recommend? ps hope Paige is ok
[3:39:10] <@JustinianKnight> BLM is also boooorrring
[3:39:16] <+the22cstomp> use the cursed P word
[3:39:16] <XileElekt> Wait so is what he was saying true, about synergy in trust, that thancred wont use cartridge without minfilia2.0 there
[3:39:18] <ManfredA> naturally this is at odds with the entire rest of the game
[3:39:26] <penitentpentwitch> Considering it can get him banned, safer to not stream ACT
[3:39:27] <Otobiworldo> What are your thoughts on Squadron Vs. Trust
[3:39:30] <+Rose_Silvers> blm at level 80 has more movement then ever before
[3:39:34] <%aslfrasle> I think you mean BLM is *booming*
[3:39:36] <Reddhero12> @Bailey__gaming dark knight
[3:39:38] <XileElekt> @Bailey__gaming Smn (warlock) and Paladin (paladin)
[3:39:39] <%radregice> @XileElekt then they need to have an anime style cooking tournament arc
[3:39:39] <+ecolli37108> @cawi trusts can only be used on 80 dungeons, bonewiccas from 70
[3:39:39] <ManfredA> people who don't love fire 4s and leylines are heathens
[3:39:40] <%twoto858> Nuts
[3:39:42] <%AncelDeLambert> AncelDeLambert subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 22 months, currently on a 22 month streak! Hey Pat thanks for keeping shit normal. It's been rough now that my dad was diagnosed with terminal cancer and has about a year, so you've helped me maintain. I love ya, you weird orb, pet the baby.
[3:39:47] <Dral54> Unless you use the Forbitten tech
[3:39:47] <%Cardz_> THE TICKLER
[3:39:50] <ColRedyx> @Bailey__gaming What spec of Paladin? Summoner is closest to warlock.
[3:39:51] <%feMC_is_best_girl> This music is distGasm
[3:39:54] <%Daniel_Is_I> Y'know what I love about BLM? When I give them a dragon eye and they stand so far away from melee that it can't form a chain.
[3:39:57] <%twoto858> BLM was one I was interested in the most honestly
[3:39:57] <%Daxalog> Ya winnin son?
[3:40:02] <%ragingbrachy> @AncelDeLambert <3
[3:40:03] <%AncelDeLambert> "the tickler"????
[3:40:05] <ManfredA> @Rose_Silvers yeah but once you're at 80 you're done leveling BLM Kappa
[3:40:06] <%LadyTheWanderer> shb music is amazing
[3:40:07] <%BunnyEmperor> rip Tesleen
[3:40:07] <%ClericOfSparda> FFXIV streamers show their ACT all the time. The only time it's a problem is if you use it to be toxic
[3:40:09] <+hrodbehrat> Hey Pat, I hope you're having an amazing day, kiss elmo and rub paiges tummy
[3:40:09] <+cawi> @ecolli37108 can I level my NPCs that high?
[3:40:10] <%TheShal> SO WHITE
[3:40:15] <%Invlux> Kappa
[3:40:15] <%radregice> @Daniel_Is_I tell me about it
[3:40:17] <@JustinianKnight> they all use torture devices as moves
[3:40:20] <%octavian_gish> almost as good as fucking "Tide Pod"
[3:40:21] <Aydarkzero> DansGame
[3:40:21] <%AncelDeLambert> thanks Brachy
[3:40:23] <%ragingbrachy> pat
[3:40:23] <+MisterCrimson> Black Mana Matters
[3:40:24] <penitentpentwitch> Black Mana Matters!
[3:40:24] <+Grayhammatter> so white, pale as a ghost
[3:40:28] <%Cardz_> Need some black in your life
[3:40:32] <%Bailey__gaming> @colredyx holy or retribution
[3:40:37] <%Arxel1> RDM, the TRUE CENTRIST POWER
[3:40:38] <ArthurDoyleRPG> doodBro
[3:40:40] <+mrTittysprinkles> its also harder to regain the lower mana once youre imba
[3:40:56] <+SH1NK1R0> This is making me want to play......I miss gnb
[3:40:57] <XileElekt> So
[3:40:58] <%MaddyCaddy> But you won't get sick pink parses unless you double weave
[3:41:00] <ricotez> they got rid of the imbalance penalty I think
[3:41:01] <ManfredA> some classes like double weaving much more than others
[3:41:05] <olaksi> Does double weaving even matter outside of opener boost?
[3:41:13] <ManfredA> yes
[3:41:15] <SweetCuppingCake> @cawi I think trusts are only for SHB content, not Stormblood
[3:41:17] <Reddhero12> of course @olaksi its a big dps gain
[3:41:17] <+metalsiren31> Not being able to double weave as DRK wouldbe so painful
[3:41:19] <%MaddyCaddy> Yeah
[3:41:20] <penitentpentwitch> Imbalance penalty still exists
[3:41:20] <+the22cstomp> yes
[3:41:21] <ManfredA> some classes have hella double weaves
[3:41:22] <%Blackjack760> yes
[3:41:22] <anAngryHamster> Pat do you feel that there will ever be a proper pet class in 14?
[3:41:26] <Reddhero12> double weaving is always a dps boost
[3:41:29] <+mrTittysprinkles> for rdm very commonly
[3:41:35] <XileElekt> No joke. I was at a in-game Black lives matter protest. Everyone was BLM. Then some ppl came in as BLU's to counter protest, saying blue lives matter, then ppl changed to WHM to be Counter the BLU counter protest
[3:41:38] <%Afterman_> what do you think of the bubba changes for dbd
[3:41:40] <+the22cstomp> double weaves are very important to classes like nin and rdm
[3:41:43] <ManfredA> @anAngryHamster there was
[3:41:44] <%LadyTheWanderer> the fk is a double weave
[3:41:47] <%Metballs> Depending on the fight and the oGCD you might lose a cast if you hold it too long
[3:41:55] <@JustinianKnight> big weaving on NIN all the time
[3:41:57] <Reddhero12> two oGCD's between two GCD's @LadyTheWanderer
[3:41:57] <ManfredA> SMN pre-ShB had actual pets
[3:41:58] <@SSaryn> And if you're even trying to Triple Weave, if you don't have less than 100ms, probably just don't.
[3:42:01] <Reddhero12> without clipping
[3:42:11] <Reddhero12> @SSaryn no such thing as triple weaving
[3:42:15] <ColRedyx> @Bailey__gaming Hmmm, well if you don't like tanking then FF14's PLD is no good because it's only a tank. I never really played holy paladin but I remember it has massive single-target heals so you might like WHM or AST. Closest to Ret is probably Samurai?
[3:42:18] <Reddhero12> no class can triple weave
[3:42:22] <%Metballs> loltriple weaving
[3:42:24] <%pilgrimsayswhat> bard - you like pressing buttons?
[3:42:24] <+the22cstomp> triple weaving is a no no
[3:42:26] <Animal_Farm4> You will always clip a triple weave
[3:42:29] <@SSaryn> Correction, SMNs did it all the time in 3.x.
[3:42:30] <ManfredA> SMN used to have to triple weave
[3:42:34] <ManfredA> I think they fixed that
[3:42:39] <%VHGS> Bard too
[3:42:40] <Reddhero12> that was 4 years ago
[3:42:40] <+Grayhammatter> huh, didn't know that, thanks for the tidbit on the torture devices being what they use justinian
[3:42:43] <ManfredA> they had to do it in 5.x too Saryn
[3:42:43] <@SSaryn> HEY
[3:42:44] <Reddhero12> we're talking about now
[3:42:46] <%MaddyCaddy> Hey :(
[3:42:48] <SweetCuppingCake> Poor SMN, constantly changing
[3:42:50] <@SSaryn> I RESENT THAT
[3:42:50] <Psyramics> they're still kinda mutants
[3:42:51] <ManfredA> yes
[3:42:54] <@SSaryn> BITCH
[3:42:54] <+starrydragons> rude
[3:42:56] <ManfredA> they had to do it in ShB too
[3:42:57] <@JustinianKnight> haha
[3:42:59] <%miguelrod777> BibleThump
[3:43:01] <ManfredA> SMN always gets fucked
[3:43:02] <%Metballs> Yeah, let's discuss cross class and stuff because that's just as relevant
[3:43:08] <XileElekt> smn has never had a fun rotation
[3:43:09] <+the22cstomp> they're just overpowered mutants
[3:43:14] <Reddhero12> lets talk about elemental resistances
[3:43:19] <ManfredA> I literally just said they had to triple weave like
[3:43:19] <Reddhero12> anyone got some ice materia?
[3:43:20] <%BunnyEmperor> They dont know what to do with SMN at this point LUL
[3:43:20] <ManfredA> a patch ago
[3:43:23] <%Valdorick> You gottem, Baseball
[3:43:26] <Otobiworldo> What are your thought on Squadron Vs Trust
[3:43:28] <tartissimus> they even got nerfed
[3:43:28] <wix964> cause BAHAMUT
[3:43:31] <Aydarkzero> whats the "best" class in this anyway?
[3:43:33] <tartissimus> BUT YOU CANT STOP US
[3:43:34] <+Rose_Silvers> SMN has too high dps then it has any right to be, it can give blm a run for it's money
[3:43:35] <@JustinianKnight> not as much as they were at least
[3:43:36] <Psyramics> current tier is just good for them, cause it lets them skip their downtime phases
[3:43:36] <+crazyspartan214> so how about them eureka huh?
[3:43:38] <KeiPrime> bring back goad
[3:43:40] <@SSaryn> SMNs at a base level have no real high skill ceiling anymore.
[3:43:40] <ManfredA> SMN is trying to be three different things
[3:43:40] <ArthurDoyleRPG> Omega Level Mutants doodThirst
[3:43:42] <%Blackjack760> cause Phoenix baby
[3:43:43] <Reddhero12> summoner is highest dps @Aydarkzero
[3:43:46] <+snausages_> BLM power levels but with added utiliity, that is SMN
[3:43:50] <ManfredA> @Aydarkzero in what metric
[3:43:54] <+the22cstomp> summoner is the best dps, gnb is the best tank, and iirc it's whm for healer?
[3:43:59] <tartissimus> right now SAM is meta with dance partner, does the most damage
[3:44:05] <+snausages_> Need to learn a new DPS so I have a fallback when SMN becomes bad again
[3:44:06] <@StridentSong> Good job Baseball
[3:44:06] <penitentpentwitch> BLM sweats bullets as SMN damage closes the gap towards them
[3:44:06] <SweetCuppingCake> @Aydarkzero It's kinda just what ever you enjoy. They all have their strengths
[3:44:07] <+Rose_Silvers> paladin is the best tank
[3:44:08] <@SSaryn> The 2min rotation 2 times over just makes it so you can do this and this while making sure you have uptime for any other things.
[3:44:08] <%Nordguy> you COULD be using your {Swifrcast} to get an extra big spell out of dualcast, but you're doin great bud
[3:44:16] <%BunnyEmperor> highly depends on the group composition
[3:44:17] <ScarletPrime> Astro is highest DPS healer if you do Cards right.
[3:44:25] <+the22cstomp> bard needs a lot of juice
[3:44:26] <%MaddyCaddy> The best job is the one you like.
[3:44:26] <ManfredA> all ranged classes need help
[3:44:27] <%lucaflowe> I need to remember how to use Summoner
[3:44:27] <+Grayhammatter> bard needs a LOT of juice
[3:44:28] <penitentpentwitch> BRD needs a buff, MNK needs a rework
[3:44:29] <%count_bob> Astro?
[3:44:29] <%ragingbrachy> an overhaul
[3:44:30] <Reddhero12> my monk friend gets 22k dps in savage, he's nuts
[3:44:33] <%SirGO0SE> 20 more minutes of download t.t
[3:44:33] <ManfredA> bard, mch and dnc need help
[3:44:40] <%MaddyCaddy> You can still play them all competitvely.
[3:44:40] <%Blackjack760> monk needs everything
[3:44:40] <valanway_diabolos> They have no idea what they're doing with Monk anymore
[3:44:41] <Psyramics> its so weird, cause they just nerfed BRD
[3:44:45] <+the22cstomp> dnc does not
[3:44:47] <funwashere> !uptime
[3:44:48] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 44m.
[3:44:49] <+RowenCleric> brd is "bad" but is still used a lot in the meta 1st clears at the highest tiers... so anything can work
[3:44:53] <%VioletHeart> The ranged DPS could use a buff and Summoner needs to be tuned down a bit but it's otherwise all okay.
[3:44:54] <%marsantas> Monk is great but needs more to do, or a super sayin ability
[3:44:55] <%Daniel_Is_I> @PatStaresAt Damnit Pat, you just made me resub.
[3:44:55] <JoshWithASpoon> I think a lot of Monk mains don't really like Anatman? I dunno, that's what I heard.
[3:44:55] <+Rose_Silvers> mch is pretty strong, dnc too
[3:44:55] <%lucaflowe> MCH just needs more damage
[3:44:56] <ManfredA> bard is definitely the worst of them
[3:44:56] <tartissimus> dnc is busted my dude
[3:44:57] <@JustinianKnight> MCH is good
[3:44:57] <+Moaradin> Monk is the most mishandled job in the game. They have no idea what to do with them and they haven't for YEARS
[3:44:59] <trivialcoffee> dnc does ok i feel
[3:44:59] <%BunnyEmperor> to be fair physical ranged was has always been mediocre
[3:45:01] <tartissimus> doeas not need help
[3:45:02] <+snausages_> Whats wrong with SCH?
[3:45:03] <JoshWithASpoon> That and something to do with Chakra.
[3:45:07] <trivialcoffee> brd needs some love T_T
[3:45:07] <+the22cstomp> dnc is nasty good
[3:45:14] <+mrTittysprinkles> RDM is in such a good spot, its braindead but very intuitive and effective
[3:45:17] <ManfredA> @Moaradin cries in SMN
[3:45:26] <Dral54> The monk buffs made him less annoying like increased timers but it needs more QoL
[3:45:27] <@SSaryn> I'd disagree with DNC, it needs a bit of love, any decent numbers to their own DPS would be good.
[3:45:31] <Otobiworldo> Squadron Vs Trust :c
[3:45:34] <+Rose_Silvers> rng dps should always have lower dps then other dps cos they have mobility
[3:45:36] <ToBais91> why brd bad? BibleThump
[3:45:39] <%Blackjack760> can't bloack magic LUL
[3:45:44] <%VHGS> What flip universe do you people live in where dancer is really strong
[3:45:45] <@SSaryn> Another 50 potency to it's 4 skills would probably bring it up by enough.
[3:45:48] <+the22cstomp> when you can boost others dps by such a large amount, you dont need personal dps
[3:45:48] <Dral54> also buff tornado kick holy shit
[3:45:50] <ManfredA> DNC's team buffs aren't so amazing that they couldn't get some more dps
[3:45:56] <ManfredA> it's
[3:45:58] <ArthurDoyleRPG> Remember when they turned Bard into Ranger doodLUL
[3:45:58] <ManfredA> not a large amount
[3:46:00] <%Daniel_Is_I> Does NIN still suck in ShB or have they finally been fixed?
[3:46:01] <KoyaMusa> monk always gets to complain though
[3:46:02] <%Dapper_Cactuar> the classes I tend to see the least are astro, bard, and warrior
[3:46:02] <Reddhero12> gordias monkaS
[3:46:07] <ManfredA> DNC buffs are great but they're not this massive buff
[3:46:09] <%lucaflowe> BRD doesn't have the buffs to matach DNC nor the damage to match MCH
[3:46:16] <Reddhero12> ninja is really good @Daniel_Is_I
[3:46:16] <%Nordguy> dancer is consistently last place dps in savage
[3:46:18] <+RowenCleric> Nin has been fixed and is quite good now
[3:46:19] <rajathene> Thanks for the PrideRise @terrah48
[3:46:20] <%Blackjack760> god gordias
[3:46:20] <penitentpentwitch> BRD, MCH and DNC need a bit of damage tweaking. MCH needs more damage for being the SAM of Ranged. BRD and DNC are having an identity fight over who is the 'support dps'.
[3:46:21] <@JustinianKnight> NIN never sucked and theyre still very good
[3:46:22] <ManfredA> last patch it was like 1k more dps for your partner
[3:46:23] <WackyXmand> @PatStaresAt now hear me out, what if they add a move for Monk called Phoenix Flight: expand all HP except 1 and deal that as damage.
[3:46:23] <Reddhero12> ultimate fights beg to differ
[3:46:25] <%Nordguy> when i play
[3:46:32] <ColRedyx> But Pat still doesn't do them. Kappa
[3:46:34] <+mrTittysprinkles> BLMs issue is that it takes 200% more effect to eek out like 5% more dps over summoner
[3:46:34] <ManfredA> DNC's buffs are not as amazing as people think
[3:46:36] <%Mendin> Hey Pat, just doublechecking, which dungeon was the one you said way back when to turn on full effects for a really cool special attack?
[3:46:42] <Dral54> NIN has a buff that makes it so everybody loves them
[3:46:43] <%Cardz_> I use ultimate fights to level up
[3:46:44] <ColRedyx> Also, all jobs have cleared ultimate.
[3:46:47] <@JustinianKnight> agreed
[3:46:47] <KoyaMusa> nin during intro of 5.0 did suck though
[3:46:50] <%ragingbrachy> SourPls SourPls SourPls
[3:46:51] <%BunnyEmperor> you dont play your job optimal in Ultimate anyway
[3:46:52] <+Moaradin> Ultimate is for crazy people
[3:46:52] <SweetCuppingCake> DNC is supposed to just help buff their dance partner rather than have great DPS themselves
[3:46:54] <Dral54> The Praetorium, its the final dungeon from ARR
[3:46:55] <+snausages_> Did you do Savage in other expacs @PatStaresAt ?
[3:46:56] <+Finaldragoon> SourPls BANGER ALERT SourPls
[3:46:58] <%lucaflowe> If MCH gets a damage buff to it's basic rotation it'll be even better than it is
[3:47:00] <neVan0> SourPls
[3:47:00] <trivialcoffee> i think it was praetorium mendin
[3:47:01] <%cappyd33> lot of raiders would disagree with that
[3:47:01] <@SSaryn> Yeah, Ultimate is such a 1% thing like.. yeah no.
[3:47:03] <%Kaask> dnc shouldnt have a garbage 50% proc rotation. it's the reason mch was so bad to begin with.
[3:47:08] <penitentpentwitch> Also, some classes scale differently depending on secondary stats of that tier.
[3:47:10] <%Mendin> Gotcha, thanks.
[3:47:10] <%LaughingCatt> that felt like such vindication
[3:47:11] <ManfredA> @SweetCuppingCake even taking into account that they still bottom dps charts
[3:47:13] <ColRedyx> Yeah, first ultimate clear ever had the "worst" tank LUL
[3:47:15] <Reddhero12> savage is a lot different now @PatStaresAt
[3:47:16] <%cappyd33> nin apparently is super easy now
[3:47:17] <%MaddyCaddy> Shame
[3:47:18] <ManfredA> that's counting their buffs
[3:47:21] <%Mendin> I'm approaching the end of ARR MSQ so I knew it was one of those
[3:47:23] <Reddhero12> you should really give it another shot, it's a whole different beast these days
[3:47:30] <@JustinianKnight> NIN at 5.0 just had a little low dmg but it played just fine and wasnt like awful or anything
[3:47:30] <XileElekt> @PatStaresAt there's "better for dps" and "better for prog" and they aren't always the same
[3:47:31] <SweetCuppingCake> @ManfredA Oh yeah, I am aware.
[3:47:34] <Reddhero12> thats fair
[3:47:36] <ColRedyx> Bounced off Faust, huh?
[3:47:38] <%ragingbrachy> new pat :)
[3:47:42] <+Kyderz3> Did you play FFXI?
[3:47:43] <@SSaryn> And yeah people were giving DRK shit but it cleared First in the first Ultimate.
[3:47:44] <%Blackjack760> get stuck on light Rampant
[3:47:44] <+SpaceHobo55> Most people dont even play at the "meta" level they try to choose their classes by
[3:47:48] <%MaddyCaddy> That E8S phase 2 is really great.
[3:47:50] <%miguelrod777> shin pat
[3:48:04] <trivialcoffee> we dont talk about light rampant >_<
[3:48:04] <ManfredA> tl;dr this game is designed to let any class do anything comfortably well
[3:48:07] <OneThousandTomatoes> is that a bayoneta enemy?
[3:48:09] <+snausages_> I only started it in ShB, problem is people are the real difficulty level
[3:48:11] <ManfredA> which is a bit of a problem for tanks and healers
[3:48:14] <+Rose_Silvers> only thing that sucks about drk is it's invuln
[3:48:15] <+Finaldragoon> WE FALL
[3:48:17] <penitentpentwitch> Wasn't the first TEA clear a non-standard comp?
[3:48:18] <dinnydanny777> I like how this boss looks like two completely different creatures
[3:48:19] <ManfredA> since right now tanks are basically what flavor do you want today
[3:48:23] <%dinnydanny777> Like stuck together
[3:48:25] <@SSaryn> I should mention most things they usually need to address, are usually before Savage raids, they do a decently good job at balancing everything.
[3:48:36] <Personified134> I wish I could enjoy this game more but honestly the way the animations are desynced from the actaul aoe damage bothers me so much
[3:48:37] <%BunnyEmperor> First TEA clear was with a BLM
[3:48:48] <Dral54> Boy do the Trust dungeons take longer than regular duty finder
[3:48:49] <Psyramics> I've never had anyone be toxic at me for my choice of class
[3:48:50] <SweetCuppingCake> I'm really hoping we get Chemist for next expansion. I wanna throw bottles at people's faces
[3:48:51] <ManfredA> if you like class diversity, don't play tank or healer
[3:48:51] <%Daxalog> I never understood that telegraph. You go into the damging zone?
[3:48:52] <ColRedyx> @penitentpentwitch It was a standard comp in the sense of 2 tanks 2 healers 4 DPS, but it wasn't "meta"
[3:49:01] <@SSaryn> Nah just cast once, Dualcast, cast, Dualcast.
[3:49:15] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Why is this the absolute best dungeon boss music ever?
[3:49:17] <%octavian_gish> nah, just black mage
[3:49:18] <%ragingbrachy> NotLikeThis
[3:49:24] <Psyramics> haha, SMN goes Ruin 2
[3:49:25] <%octavian_gish> if you dont have triple up, this sucks ass
[3:49:28] <penitentpentwitch> @ColRedyx Yup. I'm trying to remember if it was RDM
[3:49:33] <Personified134> @Daxalog the telegraphs are desynced from the actual animations, and the damage is from the telegraph not the animation; its one of the things I hate about the game
[3:49:33] <ColRedyx> @Daxalog Which telegraph?
[3:49:34] <+leviting> Is it rough just becuase you have to keep orbiting?
[3:49:39] <tubit> Looks pretty shit for monk as well
[3:49:42] <+Rose_Silvers> @AlteisenReiseZ The twinning comes to mind
[3:49:42] <ManfredA> also real talk: if people cared more about learning their chosen class than meta comps for people who know how to, the playerbase would be much more competent
[3:49:45] <%AncelDeLambert> look at this Seath motherfucker
[3:49:48] <penitentpentwitch> To google!
[3:49:50] <ColRedyx> @penitentpentwitch First TEA clear had a BLM when SMN was meta.
[3:49:53] <+SpaceHobo55> all classes with cast times
[3:49:56] <%xWanderingFlame> psaDab
[3:50:02] <%ragingbrachy> no
[3:50:02] <Aydarkzero> weird looking enemy
[3:50:03] <%TheSpartanThief> Oh noooooooooooooooo
[3:50:04] <%AncelDeLambert> How's it feel, Philia, to be a... biiiiitch?
[3:50:05] <%BunnyEmperor> you can do literally any content with any job
[3:50:09] <Dral54> Aint even got legs
[3:50:10] <@JustinianKnight> yea honestly just play what is the most fun to you
[3:50:11] <tubit> and classes with positionals
[3:50:13] <+the22cstomp> if people cared more about being decent at learning mechanics, not just their job
[3:50:16] <+snausages_> The problem is the game doesn't really teach DPS mains how to be good until they hit ex and savage, but tanks and heals learn naturally through all the content in the game
[3:50:18] <@JustinianKnight> none of them are actually bad
[3:50:20] <ManfredA> meta comps are for speedclears
[3:50:20] <KoyaMusa> so in the time of two of those good dungeon runs pat had, one trust run will be done
[3:50:23] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> aint even, got, legs
[3:50:29] <%LadyTheWanderer> i need some tips on being a better tank with GNB
[3:50:32] <+snausages_> It's really annoying sometimes how bad people are at rotations and mechs
[3:50:33] <%VHGS> @snausages_ listen: No.
[3:50:36] <SweetCuppingCake> I do enjoy the fact that you can clear anything so long as you actually know your class.
[3:50:40] <%Daxalog> @ColRedyx The one thats Arrows pointing inwards towards a rectangle
[3:50:40] <ManfredA> it's literally just for shaving off minutes from a fight you're trying to automate for gear
[3:50:41] <%Metballs> No, she's too shy
[3:50:41] <ColRedyx> Yeah if you're playing a meta class because it's meta, chances are extremely that you're playing worse than you would if you played the class you're comfortable with.
[3:50:42] <%lucaflowe> Yeah don't worry about the "meta" honestly
[3:50:43] <%Cardz_> nope
[3:50:43] <+RowenCleric> play what is most fun, like I said BRD is in a bad spot, but clears things eeaaassy and is still used in highest tier ultimate stuff
[3:50:43] <@JustinianKnight> she does not
[3:50:46] <%CJett92> Any time that boss punches, I just hear Patricks "AND HERE COMES THE GIANT FIST"
[3:50:46] <+SpaceHobo55> @BunnyEmperor absolutely, you might run into shitters want x/y/z but they usually suck anyways
[3:50:50] <OneThousandTomatoes> oh, BLM means black mage
[3:50:50] <ToBais91> so good to play whatever? cool
[3:50:51] <%Kaask> not if you're dps
[3:50:53] <ColRedyx> The "meta" is based on <5% differences.
[3:50:56] <ShdwDstryr> She does if you are not DPS
[3:50:57] <+mrTittysprinkles> caster lb WeirdChamp
[3:51:00] <%MaddyCaddy> @LadyTheWanderer Fit 9 GCDs in No Mercy
[3:51:04] <penitentpentwitch> I believe Ryne uses the LB if the player is not a DPS and Y'shtola is in the group.
[3:51:05] <%ShawnTK_> they don't use LB if you are a tank
[3:51:08] <+Semimythic> Alisaie, however, LOVES to LB in my experience lol
[3:51:10] <%ShawnTK_> DPS*
[3:51:10] <%lucaflowe> Yeah every Job is viable
[3:51:14] <%xWanderingFlame> Big dick dps
[3:51:16] <+Finaldragoon> 28 minutes for a Trust clear, not bad
[3:51:17] <Decahexa> Do you trust now Pat?
[3:51:20] <%ragingbrachy> great :)
[3:51:20] <+SpaceHobo55> Gunbreaker does a bit more damage "WOW META BEST TANK!"
[3:51:24] <%Daxalog> That one. That telegraph is weird. They stood IN the laser.
[3:51:30] <Aydarkzero> but number go up
[3:51:33] <KoyaMusa> monk being viable doesn't mean it doesn't need to not be fixed
[3:51:35] <ManfredA> all the tanks are just different flavors of vanilla
[3:51:37] <Reddhero12> can we see a trial/raid roulette to show off a cool fight? @PatStaresAt
[3:51:38] <SweetCuppingCake> take advantage of the MSQ roulette
[3:51:39] <ManfredA> GNB is the most active
[3:51:39] <%SinisterBroccoli> do trusts and just watch anime
[3:51:41] <%gespenst25> or really want to level the trusts lol
[3:51:42] <+gaemjurnalist> god i want to try tanking but i am afraid of scary people, healing was a nightmare
[3:51:43] <%BunnyEmperor> our static MNK knows that no one plays MNK because it sucks and yet she plays it and is doing well with it, also Mantra is nice to have in Savage and Ultimate
[3:51:43] <@JustinianKnight> you do it to get gear/lvl the trusts
[3:51:44] <tartissimus> drk is the best for pure tanking
[3:51:46] <ManfredA> I miss 4.x DRK
[3:51:48] <%ragingbrachy> pat be a lalafell
[3:51:49] <tartissimus> THE BLACKEST NOGHT POG
[3:51:52] <tartissimus> night
[3:51:52] <%LadyTheWanderer> @maddycaddy then i def need to get materia lol
[3:51:54] <zamzoph> @PatStaresAt thanks, looking forward to hearing more on that
[3:51:57] <ColRedyx> Don't use your class as a crutch. Your personal skill matters way more than extremely minor differences in SIMULATED output.
[3:52:00] <Psyramics> yeah, show chat what Labyrinth is like in the Alliance Roulette
[3:52:03] <%lucaflowe> Tanking is way easier than healing
[3:52:04] <$QueequegTheater> @tartissimus WAR is. More mitigation
[3:52:06] <%Kaask> you dont even need to help in trusts. just move forward, let thancred pull and the others kill.
[3:52:11] <zamzoph> @PatStaresAt going to talk about what dailies to keep up on while doing MSQ?
[3:52:15] <SweetCuppingCake> If you're in an FC, make sure that heat of battle II is up
[3:52:18] <XyraFhoan> player skill >>> choice of job to play
[3:52:18] <Otobiworldo> what are your thoughts on trust vs squadron
[3:52:19] <+SpaceHobo55> I just do 2 levels a day
[3:52:23] <%SirGO0SE> my friend wants to level with me but said he cant make anything below level 20, is there a solution for him? @PatStaresAt
[3:52:27] <ManfredA> yeah
[3:52:32] <%MrBorisMakarov> are they putting trusts in earlier dungeons?
[3:52:33] <$QueequegTheater> DO IT AGAIN THO
[3:52:33] <ManfredA> I can't emphasize this enough
[3:52:36] <ManfredA> learn your class
[3:52:39] <ManfredA> study your rotations
[3:52:41] <%LadyTheWanderer> OOOHH, shit i forgot about beast tribes
[3:52:42] <+Semimythic> MSQ takes a minute but it gives a metric fuckton of xp
[3:52:45] <ManfredA> learn healing theory if you're a healer
[3:52:47] <%Elky3> can you tweet this out so I have it wriiten down @PatStaresAt chariBLESS chariBLESS_HF
[3:52:47] <Coliaki> but did you do pvp though
[3:52:50] <Reddhero12> @SirGO0SE what do you mean he cant make anything below level 20?
[3:52:56] <%BunnyEmperor> Pat go do an Extreme trial for funsies
[3:53:00] <$QueequegTheater> Stormblood DansGame
[3:53:06] <SweetCuppingCake> MSQ is a good time to either watch something or play another game while doing it haha
[3:53:07] <ManfredA> tanks are pretty much just point the boss away and use cooldowns unless you go into savages/extremes
[3:53:08] <%xWanderingFlame> You look hot pat
[3:53:09] <zenith0111> lytKILLGOKU lytKILLGOKU lytKILLGOKU lytKILLGOKU lytKILLGOKU
[3:53:11] <%MrBorisMakarov> new class anxiety is real sometimes
[3:53:12] <XileElekt> we have Squadron for ARR
[3:53:12] <$QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Go stomp UWU solo
[3:53:12] <%SirGO0SE> @Reddhero12 "all my jobs are lvl 20+"
[3:53:14] <@JustinianKnight> ARR and some of HW has the Squadrons
[3:53:14] <%ragingbrachy> fast. yes :)
[3:53:14] <Psyramics> A lot of ARR dungeons are fucky-wucky, cant really have a sprout go in there by themselves
[3:53:15] <%Agami23> give trusts into heavensward so i can gawk at aymeric
[3:53:15] <%weissguard> woooo
[3:53:16] <%lucaflowe> When are they adding flight to the ARR areas?
[3:53:18] <XileElekt> and HW we have Squadron
[3:53:22] <%xWanderingFlame> psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead
[3:53:25] <aeonicvector> choose bluemage
[3:53:26] <HumanZac> !uptime
[3:53:27] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 53m.
[3:53:27] <OneThousandTomatoes> I think this probably exists in forums online
[3:53:28] <Reddhero12> @SirGO0SE FATEs sync him down, and so do dungeons. you guys can do those together
[3:53:29] <KoyaMusa> 5.3 arr flying
[3:53:29] <%Nordguy> now do a PvP
[3:53:29] <ManfredA> @lucaflowe the ARR rework
[3:53:29] <aeonicvector> oh or that
[3:53:32] <ManfredA> so next patch prolly
[3:53:36] <CptHarlok> Does the game's story pick up after RRB? That first campaign just draaaaaaaaags on.
[3:53:37] <XileElekt> Never mentioned Squadron D:
[3:53:45] <%BunnyEmperor> Just be lazy and do your daily roulettes and you will level up fast enough
[3:53:47] <%SirGO0SE> @Reddhero12 kk ill let him know that :)
[3:53:50] <%ragingbrachy> monkaSyes

[3:57:31] <Reddhero12> @SirGO0SE remember you can level every class on one character, so if you don't like one you can swap without having to make a new character. Be careful though, if you try to level up ALL the classes you could end up burnt out and never really mastering any of them
[3:57:31] <KeiPrime> they even have tabs on f and j
