[0:00:15] <DaKnightWarrior> lytMOTIVATED
[0:00:17] <%holydeviant1> What kills pat first? The conveyor belt panic, storage panic, or aliens and endless pits?
[0:00:25] <+tigerfang86> mind gobbolins at it again

[0:01:12] <%holydeviant1> Alright, how long does he last? Does he *build the elevator*
[0:01:16] <%Dunmarkh> about time
[0:01:18] <%AzureGale> The menu panic will do him in
[0:01:28] <%AzureGale> He sees the menu and nopes right out
[0:01:30] <gryffinp> I think Pat might manage to avoid spaghetti belts. The game DOES give you the tools to do so.
[0:01:37] <CrematedCube> We're all ready for some spaghetti
[0:01:42] <gryffinp> Pat plays mmos, he can handle menus
[0:01:52] <+hadji087> bro tell paige to unban me from your twitter mon tabarnak
[0:01:56] <%Jekado> its not really menu heavy
[0:02:02] <%Jekado> the issue is managing power early
[0:02:06] <%ballzxxtoxxyou> ballzxxtoxxyou subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 7 months, currently on a 3 month streak! Hey Pat! My fiancée and I got a puppy last month. He’s a Pyredoodle, a Great Pyrenees and poodle mix. We are at the potty training phase right now. How hard was it to potty train zangief?
[0:02:08] <%Jekado> since self power isn't a thing for a bit
[0:02:24] <%93lobo> 93lobo subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! play Runterra sometime  coward, also congrats on the engagement
[0:02:27] <%holydeviant1> Oh yeah, power's a bit of a bitch early on
[0:02:37] <Manwad> deforesting the planet for biofuel
[0:02:45] <%holydeviant1> I forgot that once you hit oil tier it becomes less of an issue
[0:02:48] <gryffinp> I gotta bookmark this song
[0:03:28] <%holydeviant1> Either way, it's just a matter of keeping enough biofuel going
[0:03:31] <AnneSQF> Satisfactory? Fuck yeah <3
[0:03:32] <DaKnightWarrior> Yeah, this song is so good.
[0:03:37] <$Trenr> I really wish you could at least semi-automate fuel in the first stages
[0:03:43] <gryffinp> the bio stage of power is survivable if you have the brainwave of assembing a dedicated constructor area to turn leaves/wood into solid biofuel and then just chainsawing up the place every once in a while
[0:03:49] <gryffinp> but not everyone figures that out
[0:03:49] <%TheFramedWarlock> Is it just me or is the stream fucked

[0:04:18] <%Jekado> @gryffinp yeah i did that since solid biofuel is useful for a while.
[0:04:29] <%holydeviant1> @gryffinp Yeah, you have to have a biofuel processing chain for early game, but you won't die without it

[0:04:51] <gryffinp> Well I wasn't being literal

[0:05:15] <%MegboyManuel> MegboyManuel subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 27 months, currently on a 27 month streak! You playing Satisfactory is either gonna go super well and youre gonna enjoy yourself, or this is gonna be a disaster and its gonna BREAK you like Baba did to Paige. Either way, it should be a good time
[0:05:17] <holydeviant1> At least this isn't space engineers, or Subnautica, or breathedge, or KSP, or...
[0:05:29] <+MassConnect> factorio?
[0:05:31] <segychan> i love subnautica :>
[0:05:51] <%PinkertonDanPie> wats AOT?
[0:05:51] <%holydeviant1> Subnautica has serious storage issues
[0:05:53] <+MassConnect> subnautica is worth a play
[0:05:55] <$Trenr> Subnautica is amazing, agreed.
[0:06:02] <%holydeviant1> Not as bad as Valhiems but augh
[0:06:02] <CrematedCube> I suspect Pat will be much more comfortable once he can box up his buildings
[0:06:18] <$Trenr> Only in the beginning, when you have the option of water lockers and that's it
[0:06:21] <jackrulez92> limmyEcciedL limmyEcciedM limmyEcciedR
[0:06:21] <$lemon_rinds> @pinkertondanpie Attack on Titan
[0:06:25] <$Trenr> after you build a base it's fine
[0:06:31] <%dekkitout> Is this another step on the long, slow path of Pat playing minecraft?
[0:06:53] <+D00msDayDan> once you start encasing the planet in foundation the mind goblins go away
[0:06:54] <Ipsenscastle> This is going to be horrible, I'm very excited
[0:07:00] <%Jekado> yeah the snap to grid in satisfactory is pretty good
[0:07:10] <+Suchawus> Valheim needs a way to destroy items
[0:07:21] <$Dakuu75> watching woolie's stream, he's ont he part where Ichiban get's out and he's talking like, "Did ichiban's stats go down in prison?", "No, the level cap jsut went up." lmao
[0:07:24] <gryffinp> Its frustrating that the snap to grid in vaheim isn't as good as it is in satisfactory
[0:07:26] <%holydeviant1> Oh god yeah, Such
[0:07:40] <%BoxNavy> i was overwhelmed after i finished the tutorail in satisfactory so im excited to see how pat fares
[0:07:42] <NoCreditClear> This is either going to be incredible or a total shitshow. No middle ground.
[0:07:50] <%holydeviant1> I have a little dock called "Garbage Ocean"
[0:07:54] <%JamesCorck> JamesCorck subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 14 months! Congrats on the engagement guys! Pat, please never stop bashing on Pokémon. Sure it's a low hanging fruit of a subject but it's just super funny when the fans keep coming up with excuses to defend the many flaws of it.
[0:08:08] <+NecDW4> @NoCreditClear FUCKING RIGHT?!?!?!
[0:08:15] <%holydeviant1> @NoCreditClear Satisfactory is so much simpler than factorio
[0:08:36] <+D00msDayDan> satisfactory is a lot easier because you can build in 3d and no bugs
[0:08:43] <segychan> i love this paige animation
[0:08:55] <+NecDW4> I'm looking forward to the most mind-gobliny mind goblins that ever goblined a mind.
[0:09:00] <Tytangamer> I think Satisfactory is going to appeal precisely to Pat's brand of OCD, because it's a minecrafty game where there's a right and wrong way to do things.
[0:09:19] <+tigerfang86> yeah this wait animation is great
[0:09:19] <%Ranryu692> I miss the Volta animations
[0:09:28] <+MassConnect> Pat is factory?
[0:09:33] <xbb1024> Satisfactory is also more OCD triggering because your building in a 3D environment
[0:09:34] <gryffinp> I wouldn't go so far as to say there's a right and wrong way but there's a POINT. you build this shit for a PURPOSE

[0:10:15] <NoCreditClear> The problem will be if he gets caught in a loop of constantly tearing everything down because of one possible improvement or tiny flaw in how it's all laid out instead of just moving forward and coming back later.
[0:10:19] <Psyramics> in a game like this, there's no right or wrong way, its all various efficiency metrics
[0:10:32] <+MassConnect> Can Satisfactory make box cutters?

I'm glad this month has given me 3 free games I've been meaning to play (FF7R, Blasphemous, and Remnant: From the Ashes) but I'm too busy with Granblue's anniversary and Arknights' Roguelike mode. Oh no. Gachas.
[0:46:01] <Dragovus> @PatStaresAt 200 grams not pounds
[0:46:01] <%AzureGale> wat
[0:46:02] <%brickwall35> would you fuck a horse?
[0:46:03] <%sniffy77> I was so bored today I did my taxes
[0:46:05] <LastnameSilverLastname> Pat a horse is like 1300lbs
[0:46:05] <%abusywizard> it’s a pat sized horse
[0:46:06] <+Deekman> average horse weight is 1,000 pounds
[0:46:07] <%Spydurman> but can a 200 lb horse swim?
[0:46:07] <%coward_man> Pat your brain broke by going for a walk
[0:46:08] <%super_ej8> LUL
[0:46:10] <+MajorCrasher> LUL
[0:46:11] <+transporterthesequel> So a horse for pat
[0:46:13] <DusK_The_Stray> Couldn't even not laugh through it
[0:46:15] <Sprawler14> mine too
[0:46:18] <mrblack499> LIES!! lol
[0:46:19] <%Pookiedaexzile> Yeah I could pick up a horse
[0:46:20] <Blank9> Pat could do backflips all day.
[0:46:21] <%BakiinPlaysStuff> I'm pretty sure I can take a deer
[0:46:23] <$Futurecity10> @PatStaresAt Average Weight of a horse is 800-2,200 pounds
[0:46:23] <%GeneralSCPatton> My Great Pyrenees Lab mix already weighs almost as much as my whole skinny ass.
[0:46:25] <%notsoy> google says horse weight is anywhere from 900 - 2200
[0:46:25] <Tytangamer> Pat raises cattle... over his head.
[0:46:26] <skyentombment> Pat is pushing cumming and boxcutters a LOT these days, what's up with that?
[0:46:27] <Arek_1> LUL
[0:46:28] <+MooseIsGoose> No but I totes could
[0:46:28] <$Dakuu75> that's pretty good <3
[0:46:29] <%Vibe__Lord> @PatStaresAt I CAN KNOCK OUT A HORSE IN ONE PUNCH RIGHT BETWEEN THOSE DUMB EYES
[0:46:31] <RGBgamesinc> if you can pick up a horse a rat can swim
[0:46:32] <Diablo169> Physical exercise has destroyed Pat's rationality today.
[0:46:32] <%BoomerSqueaker> Bet you could do a sick piledriver to a horse. They're chumps
[0:46:33] <%crimsonharvest> dont have my lifting belt
[0:46:34] <triggersqueeze1985> They shit while they walk
[0:46:35] <%luftraumm1> that's just an argument for oppa homeless style
[0:46:37] <tommyvk> Pat, stream yourself trying to lift a horse. if you fail, you must donate 5000 dollars to Woolie
[0:46:38] <Ipsenscastle> i picked up a cow once
[0:46:39] <%Pookiedaexzile> Hold my Beer Statements

[0:50:34] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Pokemon sucks ass and is stupid, but I still kinda like it.
[0:50:36] <Yakobro> official pokemon games suck ASS, there are dope fangames that are an actual challenge though
[0:50:45] <%JoshManVGH> But they aren't mad for a good reason...
[0:50:46] <yourliteraldog> I want a game with less features
[0:50:48] <%BoxNavy> play a real rpg

[0:51:01] <%JoshManVGH> Brand
[0:51:04] <xmetalicdemonx> Just stop buying and it will either get better or die out. Either way win/win.
[0:51:04] <T_Sasquatch> there i said it
[0:51:05] <dankvonmemelord> all we want is heart gold soul silver 2
[0:51:06] <%YakumoYomi> Absolutely. TPC doesn't give a shit about the games.
[0:51:08] <Darthkitten_Prime> I DID
[0:51:08] <F_manS> I've played to Pokemon games Silver and X, and i'm good for 20 years.
[0:51:08] <TurtlesAndTentacles> not true. I just like the games
[0:51:09] <+ShudMirelurk> I stopped.
[0:51:10] <dan_g_v> it's all about the figmas of the MC's
[0:51:12] <fiercefiresoul> I love the concept of Pokemon, but the games got immensely stale for me mid-way through a playthrough of the original Platinum.
[0:51:13] <dark_kebabs> dude, pat's stream is always cutting out and jumping ahead on me. Is it the same for anyone else?
[0:51:14] <%Broand> But pat what about the pokemon waifu gym leaders
[0:51:14] <+SparrowHW> the community is extremely divided on the DPPT remakes, half love it and the other half hate it
[0:51:14] <Daniel_Is_I> Pat didn't you say on the podcast that people should settle for Legends being awful because at least they innovated a little?
[0:51:16] <Visorak6> Gamefreak has absolutely zero excuses but you cant complain if you're part of the problem
[0:51:16] <+MajorCrasher> I'm still mad and I haven't bought one of the games in over a decade
[0:51:18] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Oh I don't buy pokemon games, I just like the idea of it.
[0:51:19] <reonome> no
[0:51:19] <ThatGuyThere03> I stopped
[0:51:19] <%TheShal> Good afternoon Mr Peach Saliva
[0:51:19] <%BoomerSqueaker> I know people who only buy the games LUL

[0:51:23] <+Sleepy_Puma> I jumped off at Emerald my guy
[0:51:23] <%Pookiedaexzile> If only they grew up to play real rpgs
[0:51:24] <EuropanLamprey> I gave up once they stopped putting in all Pokemon
[0:51:24] <JackalKing> I DID stop buying pokemon games. Am I allowed to complain now?
[0:51:24] <+paladinstarbuster> i like the games tho
[0:51:24] <%AncelDeLambert> already done
[0:51:24] <+OneGorillionDollars> Hard Agree
[0:51:25] <%crabmeat495> Fuck em
[0:51:26] <Yakobro> @T_Sasquatch wtf you buy video games you CHILD?
[0:51:27] <yourliteraldog> Gluttons who would not be satisfied with all the riches of heaven.
[0:51:27] <DusK_The_Stray> I did, and I'm glad I did.
[0:51:27] <$Dakuu75> haven't played a pokemon game since Gold
[0:51:27] <%Broand> oh I get it
[0:51:27] <%brickwall35> I'm going to start buying them to spite you
[0:51:28] <Gorgs7> yeah, just emulate it like a normal person
[0:51:28] <%fritz_dacat> but i want pokemon snap
[0:51:30] <@commanderclaw> The waifus come to me and I don't even have to buy them
[0:51:30] <%SirGO0SE> you were right on with the Madden comparison
[0:51:30] <%TheCallousKing> Same goes for EA sports games
[0:51:32] <marvel877> Give me a new POKKEN game, damn it.
[0:51:34] <%Alazull> lel
[0:51:34] <%Valdorick> Hawt
[0:51:35] <%Dunmarkh> I haven't bought any since sumo
[0:51:36] <Sprawler14> HMM
[0:51:38] <+Sleepy_Puma> Cock e mon
[0:51:39] <DaKnightWarrior> I stopped years ago.
[0:51:39] <%Broken_Sonex> Hey Pokémon fans. Play a REAL RPG!!!
[0:51:39] <+Gespens> I get the sentiment, but the last five years was like, 2 generations-- we can go about 10 years back
[0:51:40] <%Broand> Pokemon is Nintendo's FATE
[0:51:43] <%Agami23> fuck thats a good analogy.
[0:51:44] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Man I wish I had some of that sweeet sweeeet pokemon CASH
[0:51:47] <dizimous> Fair
[0:51:48] <TurtlesAndTentacles> I like fighting Cocks
[0:51:49] <Ashecroft> God fucking damnit thats a good comparison
[0:51:50] <DusK_The_Stray> Love Pokemon as a concept, but I'm not buying the games anymore.
[0:51:50] <%linSP> I’ve never complained about Pokémon and have bought all of them same as those that DO complain
[0:51:51] <timdtoolmantaylor> desmiiNonono desmiiNonono desmiiNonono
[0:51:57] <KaiserMario> I much prefer Randy's cocmagic
[0:51:58] <Blank9> I'd take a new pokken, or pokemon conquest
[0:52:00] <%MugenSandan> oh is that Zangief snoring I thought Paige was moaning in pain
[0:52:01] <yourliteraldog> Pokemon is basically fate
[0:52:01] <%ClericOfSparda> All my friends who still love Pokémon actually want the same game to play with slightly better graphics
[0:52:01] <%SuckerPunchSyd> I stopped cause i complained so much about sword and shield before they came out and didnt buy them
[0:52:03] <fiercefiresoul> And now it's at the point where these games are just all the same, and like...I'm not even attached to them anymore, but it makes me mad.  I WANT to love them again.
[0:52:04] <T_Sasquatch> @Yakobro baby game for nintendo babies :)
[0:52:05] <triggersqueeze1985> Micheal Vick sim
[0:52:06] <KaiserMario> *cock magic

[0:52:09] <marshalmorphino22> Hey Pat-man
[0:52:10] <+D00msDayDan> no he's talking about pokemon
[0:52:18] <Darthkitten_Prime> Isn't fire emblem heroes nintendo's Fate?
[0:52:22] <Ipsenscastle> i stopped buying pokemon as soon as it went 3d, i wish it would get better
[0:52:26] <marshalmorphino22> Congratulations on the proposal

[1:12:51] <jbrachob> THEY WERE ON A BREAK!
[1:12:53] <%Infernal_Dalek> China made anal swabs mandatory for visitors, to check for the COVID
[1:12:53] <%GarbageQueenEllie> They WERE, but that's not what Rachel should've been mad about.

[1:12:59] <%holydeviant1> I love how easy it is to start an argument with ANYONE

[1:13:03] <+Shady_Zaku> EEEEE WERE OON A BRRREAAAAAAK
[1:13:04] <%Piemono> You gotta clarify what a break actually means
[1:13:08] <Ipsenscastle> people real life genuinely broke up over that tv show argument
[1:13:09] <Bigyanno> It was insensitive of Ross to sleep with that chick but yeah, THEY WERE ON A BREAK
[1:13:09] <%Lion_kun> \Remember when Rachel shat on Ross for making a list of pros and cons?
[1:13:12] <%BoxNavy> i havent seen friends in forever...

[1:13:18] <NoCreditClear> That's like the only argument he's in where he's not 100% in the wrong.
[1:13:20] <DrkJP520> Why would you watch Friends when you could watch Super Best Friends?
[1:13:20] <+Mkingston> could you imagine the memes that would have been made
[1:13:21] <typhlosoin> THE DRESS IS BLUE
[1:13:22] <tommyvk> no, fuck that. Ross tried to cover up what he did because he KNEW it would upset rachel. he knows what he did was wrong and when he was caught he had a bullshit attempt at saving face
[1:13:23] <%TheotherKristian> And that's why I stopped watching friends halfway through season 2
[1:13:23] <+Nitro4life2> I still fight my mom about that every 2 months
[1:13:27] <+red_cuppa> i liked joey
[1:13:40] <%Bearded_mushrum> @PatStaresAt been watching since machinima, just heard on the pod that you did the big one and wanted to come stare back at you
[1:13:40] <Bigyanno> SHE MUGGED ROSS
[1:13:45] <+MajorCrasher> on a break doesn't mean go date/fuck other people unless specifically stated
[1:13:47] <marshalmorphino22> It’s ok, they got together in the end
[1:13:48] <Bigyanno> SHE LITERALLY MUGGED ROSS AS A CHILD
[1:13:48] <LastnameSilverLastname> Phoebe is the crime aunt
[1:13:50] <$narkonis> This is like how a lot of people hate Jerry on Seinfeld, we all watch for George.
[1:13:53] <%The_Protagonist> psaDogchamp

[1:14:18] <LastnameSilverLastname> @PatStaresAt Did Ross deserve better than Rachel, though?
[1:14:19] <%darklordfodder> On a break SPECIFICALLY means go date/fuck other people. "On a break" does not mean "vow of celebacy".
[1:14:19] <gryffinp> Aw man that's a bummer
[1:14:20] <Sprawler14> Phoebe is Chaotic Evil. Ross is Lawful Evil.
[1:14:20] <Bigyanno> SHE IMPERSONATED A POLICE OFFICER
[1:14:24] <+NecDW4> WHAT?
[1:14:25] <$narkonis> I get paranoid about the thermal paste

[1:20:45] <%KeiganOfAstora> Explain
[1:20:47] <+transporterthesequel> Hi 5 stutter bros
[1:20:49] <dankvonmemelord> it's imperceptible
[1:20:49] <frostyjay3> Okay now I feel bad for cracking a joke
[1:20:51] <%Aeoneth> It okay Pat,  we all broken a lil.  That why we like
[1:20:53] <%KeiganOfAstora> Are you just too tired to fight it now?
[1:20:53] <EvanDude47> beba
[1:20:54] <@SoFarFetched> Badong
[1:20:54] <kazadaz> the worst words
[1:20:54] <boogaleeboo> Your brain knows what it did, keep hitting it
[1:20:55] <%Archphronimos> that takes a tremendous amount of willpower I'd imagine
[1:20:55] <+Deekman> word salad
[1:20:56] <+SocialMisfitGamer> Bad Wrong - Pat
[1:20:56] <+abrupt_abe> badong
[1:20:56] <zazzera01> Badong
[1:20:56] <%baronblank> I didn't know though it really makes sense, couldn't tell how much of it was a bit
[1:20:57] <%rumtumtugnutz> You have a stutter, right?
[1:20:57] <Visorak6> isnt that dyslexia?
[1:20:58] <PinoProxie> badong
[1:20:58] <%CommanderSqueaks> It's a free comedy machine, Patrick
[1:20:59] <%TheWinged7> it makes them badong?
[1:21:00] <$Trenr> is this the crazy talk origin story
[1:21:00] <+BisoromiBear> why use hard word?
[1:21:01] <chicken_apostle> I same also the have it
[1:21:07] <%KeiganOfAstora> awww
[1:21:07] <%crimsonharvest> MC Frontalot laid out 'me here talk good? no bad talk do'
[1:21:08] <%whyskeywolfe> It's like the Word Salad episode of Boston Legal.
[1:21:08] <NitronStreams> why use good word when bad word also work
[1:21:08] <%KeiganOfAstora> that's too bad
[1:21:11] <%Bearded_mushrum> at least ur cute
[1:21:12] <kazadaz> gnodab
[1:21:12] <SheefEatsBeef> thats two words but yeah
[1:21:13] <%BoomerSqueaker> badong omg lol
[1:21:14] <%ssjklyco> I've been using your line "I talk for a living" when I flub talk now.
[1:21:15] <%valriot> Dialogue Spaghetti
[1:21:16] <%Ranryu692> James Spader had that in Boston Legal
[1:21:18] <anAngryHamster> That's part of my autism diagnosis. I world salad constantly
[1:21:19] <triggersqueeze1985> Incomprehensible babble
[1:21:19] <DaKnightWarrior> oh yeah
[1:21:20] <+Deekman> it's also indicative of advanced schizophrenia
[1:21:22] <%KeiganOfAstora> Just use less words
[1:21:25] <%WDxDracor> badwrong? that is ungood - but trymuch
[1:21:26] <%Aeoneth> You do Wordsalad a lot too though
[1:21:28] <%rumtumtugnutz> Dyslexia isn't a speech impediment
[1:21:32] <Sprawler14> oh when like make word sense no good
[1:21:38] <skyentombment> VERY high
[1:21:39] <%kewlmyc> That's a bad decision
[1:21:44] <kazadaz> he's dooing it
[1:21:46] <+TopTieramisu> woolie will go in memento order
[1:21:46] <+transporterthesequel> Yep, for me when I get too excited you might as well toss out that entire sentence
[1:21:47] <%BoomerSqueaker> Pat you'll never make it
[1:21:48] <%Broken_Sonex> That would be an OCE nighmare for me
[1:21:49] <+MajorCrasher> sounds like woolie then
[1:21:49] <kazadaz> confirmed
[1:21:50] <+MassConnect> english sucks anyway. Pat has never not made sense to me
[1:21:50] <+robosqueeb> I have aphasia, can type pretty fine but words do not leave my mouth okay
[1:21:51] <%Piemono> He should do it though
[1:21:52] <CappuccinoGuil> I would be super OK with him finishing 0 then going to 7
[1:21:53] <Blank9> beat 0, and then do 7 in 2 years
[1:21:55] <%Cozy90> HE FUCKING LOVED 7
[1:21:55] <OkamiDude15> Egregious even
[1:22:03] <%JoshManVGH> V said he's going to jump right to 7.
[1:22:03] <NeroInfinite> NEVER DO THAT
[1:22:04] <%DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt he got half spoiled on zero technically
[1:22:05] <odnucaf3> every jojo villian must have an character trait.
[1:22:06] <%justcallmebobplease> As crazy as a mouse and controller setup, pat?  Is that how crazy that'd be for Woolie to do?
[1:22:07] <%Mrbaconator> HE LOVED seven
[1:22:08] <%Divryne> HE'LL DO IT ANYWAY.
[1:22:08] <%BoxNavy> DONT do that
[1:22:11] <NeroInfinite> That's how you burn the fuck out
[1:22:12] <%cvp5127> what
[1:22:12] <gryffinp> That's definitely what I would do though
[1:22:12] <zedravan> 18 years
[1:22:12] <%TheWinged7> he will spend the next 7 years egtting to it, and be 7 games behind
[1:22:13] <%crimsonharvest> its common for ND people to have a hitch transforming information from page to mouth or imagination to mouth
[1:22:14] <sonofthedeepsouth> DO EET
[1:22:14] <%rumtumtugnutz> And then he'll never get back to it.
[1:22:16] <%TheBensonator_> He'll be all "BUT NUMBERS THO"
[1:22:16] <TopTierHarley> Lol
[1:22:17] <%neroforte177> he can literrally go 0 7 1 2 3 4 5 6
[1:22:17] <sonofthedeepsouth> TRUE
[1:22:19] <%kewlmyc> LUL
[1:22:20] <%Agami23> imagine woolie listening to pat
[1:22:21] <DaKnightWarrior> yep
[1:22:22] <%WDxDracor> LUL
[1:22:22] <%Mrbaconator> little v even said he's skipping from 4 to 7
[1:22:22] <iosephe> eyyyyy
[1:22:23] <F_manS> Bet
[1:22:24] <+SocialMisfitGamer> HE DOESN'T NEED TO DO THAT
[1:22:25] <frostyjay3> But he'll do it anyways
[1:22:26] <%holydeviant1> yarp
[1:22:26] <Broken_Sonex> That would be an OCD nightmare if he didn't complete zero and just moved to 7
[1:22:27] <Ipsenscastle> for real
[1:22:30] <+MajorCrasher> I hate that you're right
[1:22:31] <Klefth> Yeah, that sounds like Woolie
[1:22:33] <Daniel_Is_I> Then he'll pick 7 back up in a year because IT'S HIS IDEA NOW
[1:22:33] <%DianaTheAscian> Its sad how right Pat is
[1:22:33] <%notsoy> pat with the super hard read lmao

[1:22:45] <%SilvaChariot0133> LUL
[1:22:46] <sonofthedeepsouth> 5 IS A MEME
[1:22:47] <%viewtifulr> blow him up for it when he does
[1:22:52] <kazadaz> then he can go back to 5 later
[1:22:52] <T_Sasquatch> 5 IS NOT GREAT
[1:22:54] <+Cerabret100> 5 is not great
[1:22:54] <chicken_apostle> I'm on 5 atm, loving it
[1:22:54] <T_Sasquatch> YOURE INSAN
[1:22:54] <%kullumanati> Crazy talk just reversed that decision
[1:22:56] <zedravan> V confirmed part skipper
[1:22:58] <%Agami23> 4 is rad
[1:22:59] <Blank9> V thinks 2 sucks and 3 was better
[1:23:00] <%Ranryu692> 6 is great for bad reasons
[1:23:01] <%DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt is 6 worth it just to play or does that suck as well?
[1:23:01] <%kewlmyc> 5 sucks, shut up
[1:23:02] <%JoshManVGH> But 7 tho!
[1:23:02] <%Livelinne> PrideRise PrideRise PrideRise
[1:23:03] <%Lion_kun> And Judgment is good

[1:25:44] <sonofthedeepsouth> The VIDYAGAEM? PogChamp
[1:25:45] <kazadaz> it's the mode that causes arachnophobia
[1:25:46] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Thats a cool option
[1:25:46] <%holydeviant1> trst me
[1:25:48] <GunEden> arachnophobia mode makes it creepier
[1:25:48] <AnneSQF> Kappa
[1:25:48] <%MelBrooksKA> Has Pat used the cube tray since he got the thing?
[1:25:50] <gryffinp> Arachnophobia mode is arguably more horrifying than the default mode
[1:25:52] <%notsoy> arachnophobia mode? jesus christ
[1:25:54] <zazzera01> arachno mode is somehow even more terrifying
[1:25:57] <Tytangamer> Satisfactory has fucked up controller support. I've been trying to make a steam controller profile that works, but I got the game on epic so fuck me.
[1:26:04] <%DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt Pat whats the best bug?
[1:26:10] <CappuccinoGuil> GRASS
[1:26:13] <%MistyMntns> F
[1:26:14] <%holydeviant1> Yeah, otherwise you get bigass useless presents everywhere that do nothing and look like shit
[1:26:14] <anAngryHamster> Loving this Outriders stream
[1:26:18] <televisedrevolting> Unrelated but "The Saddest Factory" would make a good album name.
[1:26:18] <sonofthedeepsouth> CREATIVE TIME
[1:26:19] <%GarbageNirvana> Arachnophobia mode makes the spiders even scarier I bet
[1:26:23] <%hamborgini> get that grass
[1:26:26] <%MistyMntns> Do the Sand Planet
[1:26:28] <%TheotherKristian> So is Arachnophobia mode made to turn ON spiders?
[1:26:28] <%MistyMntns> Do it
[1:26:32] <%TheWinged7> boop bop beep bo
[1:26:32] <%Livelinne> This is going to be a mess psaSmug PrideLGBTea joofbPop
[1:26:32] <%debugdrawray_> word salad huh
[1:26:32] <+patel347> oh did i manage to catch the start
[1:26:32] <triggersqueeze1985> Spiders are the worst
[1:26:35] <NoCreditClear> Arachnophobia mode is great because there's an in-universe lore explanation for why they become glitchy cats
[1:26:41] <%crimsonharvest> *this map is not random* you aren't choosing to miss out on any of these locations
[1:26:41] <%holydeviant1> (Fun fact, these are all on one map, this is where you start)
[1:26:45] <%Movemeister> Use me. And then just touch me. Until I get my. Satisfactory.
[1:26:49] <sonofthedeepsouth> DO THE DESERT
[1:26:51] <%TheCallousKing> Pat is contractually obligated to remind you of Outriders for every stream going forward
[1:26:54] <chaosbringer28> do the second one the rocky desert, its easier than the grass fields
[1:26:54] <Gorgs7> @PatStaresAt Rocky desert has the best spot in the game, but it's a very specific one
[1:26:58] <sonofthedeepsouth> DESERT NO BALLS
[1:27:01] <%Dunmarkh> oh god that arachnophobia mode, I just googled it
[1:27:03] <+D00msDayDan> these are all just locations in different parts of the same map
[1:27:06] <chicken_apostle> Desert Dune roleplay
[1:27:07] <gryffinp> Northern forest is low key the best one but grass fields is probably the correct choice
[1:27:13] <%MistyMntns> Do the Desert
[1:27:18] <CrematedCube> It's all the same map, different drop points
[1:27:19] <%YakumoYomi> Disc...Room?
[1:27:26] <kazadaz> at the end you find out THEY'RE ALL ON EARTH
[1:27:28] <%Jekado> Desert is really good late game

[1:34:20] <%Jekado> you only have to hold down v to switch scan subject
[1:34:20] <%jarednotwithsubway> the sky manta
[1:34:21] <+EyeFarted> sky flap-flap
[1:34:22] <DrkJP520> It's the Demon's Souls boss
[1:34:23] <kingolipop> chugsGeralt
[1:34:24] <OneThousandTomatoes> dont listen to chat its green for health
[1:34:29] <kazadaz> ceci une demonsoul
[1:34:36] <%Nested_Dreams> You can ride those things :D
[1:34:42] <%takotoots> sky manta?
[1:34:52] <%Jekado> i hate those mantas
[1:34:54] <DaKnightWarrior> Rathalos bursts out of nowhere.
[1:34:54] <%BinaryFireball> I never thought I would see Pat play a survivor/crafting game
[1:34:56] <%Arancet> hail barry
[1:34:57] <yourliteraldog> Wood
[1:34:58] <AmuserName> oh no ...
[1:34:58] <Tuna_Can_0> atpCap
[1:34:58] <%Jekado> they will fly THROUGH your base...
[1:35:00] <%BinaryFireball> dont know why
[1:35:01] <CappuccinoGuil> This is a pretty good area to have dropped, honestly
[1:35:03] <%jarednotwithsubway> N U T
[1:35:07] <zazzera01> N U T
[1:35:08] <gryffinp> they didn't need to make their factory building game so cool but they put in a giant sky manta that rumbles the air and blots out the sun anyway
[1:35:09] <Ipsenscastle> look at pat failing at creativity, point and laugh
[1:35:13] <RzdAkira> Did they fix the multiplayer mode yet?
[1:35:18] <+Shady_Zaku> Brith
[1:35:21] <NoCreditClear> Turn on sprint toggle and then press shift to move fast forever.
[1:35:21] <+TheBroletariat> I'm not sure if Pat is going to hate this game or love it
[1:35:26] <%holydeviant1> @BinaryFireball Storage and organization shatters him like batman on the knee of bane
[1:35:26] <DazzlingFuhrer> impure...
[1:35:26] <%ArcanumArcanum> Impure, rip
[1:35:29] <yourliteraldog> growl
[1:35:29] <+mikesapartment> look out
[1:35:30] <%Jekado> ROCKS
[1:35:30] <mrblack499> do you have to eat and sleep in this game?
[1:35:32] <NitronStreams> GEEZUS
[1:35:33] <%takotoots> oh geez
[1:35:34] <DrkJP520> jesus
[1:35:34] <sonofthedeepsouth> ZAP EM
[1:35:34] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Use your raw materials to make a craft
[1:35:37] <+Shady_Zaku> LUL LUL LUL LUL
[1:35:37] <CappuccinoGuil> FIGHT FOR YOUR IRON, PAT
[1:35:37] <gryffinp> SPACE BOAR
[1:35:38] <dankvonmemelord> that iron has aids
[1:35:38] <OneThousandTomatoes> that fucking made me jump
[1:35:39] <kazadaz> pat remember when you play subnautica and picked up 1 billion acid mushrooms and got stuck in inventory hell?
[1:35:39] <$ZeOrbling> its gief
[1:35:41] <%jarednotwithsubway> get fucked
[1:35:42] <yourliteraldog> FIRST KILL
[1:35:43] <%josstil> death immenint
[1:35:44] <%AncelDeLambert> LUL
[1:35:45] <%Nested_Dreams> Last I checked vehicles in multiplayer are still broken
[1:35:48] <TopTierHarley> lol
[1:35:50] <+TheMorilo> wtf I didn't know that this game had enemies
[1:35:52] <chicken_apostle> eat its skin
[1:35:54] <$Afterman_> deat iniment
[1:35:55] <%ArcanumArcanum> Go to a different one
[1:35:57] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Impure = 1/2 Normal = 1/4 pure
[1:35:58] <%BinaryFireball> @holydeviant1 yea but even mindgoblins aside I just never thought it would be his thing
[1:35:59] <%AncelDeLambert> this is fine
[1:35:59] <DazzlingFuhrer> just grab it bro
[1:35:59] <+Shady_Zaku> jeebus
[1:35:59] <%josstil> prob don
[1:35:59] <+TheBroletariat> They're all impure
[1:36:00] <%MistyMntns> its fine
[1:36:01] <kazadaz> ze first off many
[1:36:02] <xbb1024> Go to all of them
[1:36:03] <+EyeFarted> both
[1:36:04] <%MistyMntns> You are good there
[1:36:04] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Go for a different area
[1:36:05] <Dumple_Roe> both
[1:36:05] <Veluren> Look at the vig pieces of iron
[1:36:06] <gryffinp> impure versus pure ore only changes rate of extraction
[1:36:08] <Veluren> big*
[1:36:08] <%hamborgini> impure is probably fine for the stream
[1:36:10] <+Rofiarf> this is fine
[1:36:11] <TG_Cid11> wait the big rock said pure
[1:36:11] <zazzera01> its not great
[1:36:12] <+Kharinite> That scared the bejeebus out of me
[1:36:12] <%jarednotwithsubway> im sure theyre all impure
[1:36:12] <CrematedCube> The other one is better quality
[1:36:13] <%Cybercobra2> it might all be impure becouse starting baby area
[1:36:13] <iosephe> There's some pure Iron right there
[1:36:14] <$ZeOrbling> that big rock said something different
[1:36:15] <+ReallyBigRocks> It's fine, you'll use them anyway
[1:36:18] <gslayer14> go back
[1:36:19] <%josstil> remember to do everything with a don
[1:36:19] <dankvonmemelord> you can run
[1:36:20] <OneThousandTomatoes> the big didnt say impure
[1:36:22] <%Jekado> each vein is different
[1:36:24] <%crimsonharvest> the big rock isnt the important part you bust that off
[1:36:28] <%jarednotwithsubway> oh sick
[1:36:28] <Tuna_Can_0> atpCap
[1:36:29] <+D00msDayDan> pure is the deposit you collect, the part you drop the miner on is the same everywhere
[1:36:33] <$ArcanumArcanum> The ground type matters for later
[1:36:34] <$Trenr> the big rocks are always pure. it's the node that's impure
[1:36:35] <%Jekado> the big rock is temperary
[1:36:37] <%holydeviant1> Ground resource: Infinite
[1:36:38] <+Rofiarf> big rock is limited
[1:36:39] <%josstil> nice beat
[1:36:42] <kazadaz> JIN GLE BELLS
[1:36:43] <iosephe> Speed
[1:36:45] <%holydeviant1> Big rock resource: Breakable
[1:36:47] <%jarednotwithsubway> probably an extra step required
[1:36:47] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> The ground is impure
[1:36:48] <CappuccinoGuil> Don't worry about purity for a while
[1:36:48] <%blastyoboots> pure is faster that's all
[1:36:49] <gryffinp> impure versus pure ore only changes rate of extraction
[1:36:50] <+Deekman> we will rock you
[1:36:52] <DazzlingFuhrer> WE WILL ROCK YOU
[1:36:53] <%Jekado> the ground one is more important for the drills
[1:36:55] <%blastyoboots> fast mine
[1:36:55] <%shruke> big rocks are always pure, but they go away.
[1:36:58] <Veluren> Pure is limited quantity but gives you more per extract
[1:37:00] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Impure produces resources at half rate, compared to normal veins
[1:37:01] <Tytangamer> The big rock is just a cap.
[1:37:02] <%Broand> IMPURE ORE MINES SLOWER THAN NORMAL OR PURE ORES
[1:37:04] <%VoidBaronJules> VoidBaronJules subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months, currently on a 4 month streak! Sorry  for the late Congratulations but keep having money for the food stealing household!
[1:37:05] <sonofthedeepsouth> NON OPTIMAL
[1:37:05] <+Rofiarf> impure is just lower rate for your minor buildings
[1:37:05] <%AncelDeLambert> would you nerds calm down, it's his first factory, it's fine
[1:37:06] <CappuccinoGuil> Purity = quantity of ore acquired
[1:37:13] <sonofthedeepsouth> HAVE TO BE OPTIMAL PAT
[1:37:14] <+InvertableQuasar> Oh this is exactly where I built my first base!
[1:37:15] <kazadaz> Da
[1:37:21] <%shruke> impure = 0.5x, normal = 1x, pure = 2x
[1:37:22] <%TheWinged7> psaBig
[1:37:24] <bonebagMEL> Check this animation out, it's pretty sick
[1:37:24] <OneThousandTomatoes> is there a zoom out?
[1:37:25] <CappuccinoGuil> Your creator has MAD range, Pat
[1:37:29] <sonofthedeepsouth> Bizarre adventure
[1:37:30] <boogaleeboo> You are going to want some space. Like a LOT of space.
[1:37:33] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Minecraft? More like Spacecraft
[1:37:35] <bonebagMEL> you have a lot of range to put it down
[1:37:41] <gslayer14> might need more space
[1:37:42] <%TheWinged7> its your central peice, everything builds off it
[1:37:43] <%linSP> “Death” whatever “non-optimal progress” FUCK
[1:37:45] <kazadaz> aim up
[1:37:49] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> I always use the fly mod to build. I am a dirty cheater.
[1:37:49] <gryffinp> You can move it later.
[1:37:52] <heartlesshealer> because on the ground
[1:37:55] <+D00msDayDan> you want the hub to be pretty out of the way, but you can move it once you've placed it
[1:37:56] <%Jekado> its okay you can move it later
[1:38:06] <Tytangamer> Maybe don't aim at your feet.
[1:38:06] <DazzlingFuhrer> show him who's boss
[1:38:07] <NoCreditClear> Pat: Dismantling stuff gives 100% material refunds. You can change anything later for free.
[1:38:08] <%Rafferty3231> hm, I didn't think the gobbolin liked buildygames
[1:38:09] <%BigDumBeak> I heard "Hug Termina" and now I'm all <333
[1:38:10] <%Broand> YOU DID THE MININ
[1:38:10] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Everything dismantles for 100% resources used.
[1:38:11] <AGRO_91> the hub lobosLewd
[1:38:13] <%Broand> HERES THE CRAFIN
[1:38:19] <zazzera01> thankfully everything can be disassembled and moved later
[1:38:20] <%CoffeeKaiju> that looks like a no man sky monster
[1:38:22] <%jarednotwithsubway> that animal is like an abstract painting
[1:38:33] <OneThousandTomatoes> @Spudnacious_Dynasty nice efficiency
[1:38:37] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Sort Button is Best Girl
[1:38:39] <%Jekado> rods
[1:38:46] <%holydeviant1> And here is where you'll spend most of the stream! :D
[1:38:55] <OneThousandTomatoes> kill em
[1:38:57] <sonofthedeepsouth> CHAD COW
[1:39:00] <%crimsonharvest> hold down buton
[1:39:02] <%crimsonharvest> its great
[1:39:04] <CappuccinoGuil> the pacific mobs give NO shits LUL
[1:39:06] <sonofthedeepsouth> Care not for boundaries
[1:39:06] <%Jekado> he does not he just gets in the way
[1:39:07] <Tuna_Can_0> friend :)
[1:39:07] <%CoffeeKaiju> that's half a whale with horse legs
[1:39:10] <yourliteraldog> It looks like a scortum
[1:39:14] <+queaks> you can hold space
[1:39:16] <Blank9> so is this just no maan's sky without the space
[1:39:17] <$Trenr> @PatStaresAt you can also hold space for crafting
[1:39:18] <%BinaryFireball> is pat recreating the gamercube?
[1:39:19] <NoCreditClear> Space Giraffe-Tick-Penguin-Whale Thing
[1:39:20] <gryffinp> The system works
[1:39:32] <+ConcoBlu> Pat is doing really well
[1:39:46] <CappuccinoGuil> I think shift+click on items transfer them to boxes/goals
[1:39:48] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Hold craft button, press esc(?) and it'll hold down click while you let go
[1:39:50] <%holydeviant1> You can build more storage pretty easily
[1:39:54] <%jarednotwithsubway> fuckin rad
[1:40:08] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> I bought the game. That settles it this is my jjam
[1:40:10] <yeeyeyee> has pat had a panic attack yet
[1:40:24] <gryffinp> Yeah so you can tear that hub down and put it somewhere else whenever you want
[1:40:38] <%Broand> for tools and junk
[1:40:41] <sonofthedeepsouth> LET GOBLINS COME OUT
[1:40:45] <yourliteraldog> He appears on the verge
[1:40:46] <%Jekado> STRAP IN
[1:40:49] <%Broand> Mine the big rocks
[1:40:50] <%crimsonharvest> smash the tall rock apart
[1:40:51] <%holydeviant1> Smack the big rocks!
[1:40:52] <%ArcanumArcanum> @PatStaresAt harvest the big pure rock Pat
[1:40:52] <+Rofiarf> select the milestone from the hub so you have the reminder
[1:40:52] <+InvertableQuasar> Smash the big rocks, more iron
[1:40:55] <zazzera01> break the rocks
[1:40:58] <%holydeviant1> It'll be a little faster
[1:41:01] <sonofthedeepsouth> EMBRACE THE GOBLINS
[1:41:01] <gryffinp> More than ten, because plates are three ingots to two plates
[1:41:05] <xbb1024> go for that big pure rock
[1:41:05] <%Jekado> you should break the big rock first
[1:41:08] <+queaks> mine the pure part
[1:41:09] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Break the big rocks on the veins for rocks
[1:41:11] <%Nested_Dreams> Mine big rock
[1:41:13] <%Broand> Mining the big rocks goes faster and you'll need to eventually
[1:41:14] <slix3431> Go mine that sky stingray
[1:41:16] <GlukosWyvern> Focus on the iron pilars
[1:41:17] <+Bentusi1634> oh pat, just so you know, whenever you equip a new item for the FIRST time, don't click or anything. They have unique animations the first time you equip them.
[1:41:18] <LVL1_Scumbag> You need infinity raw materials
[1:41:20] <%notsoy> break the tall rocks
[1:41:20] <CappuccinoGuil> Break the big rock for MASSIVE iron
[1:41:24] <LVL1_Scumbag> The answer is always more
[1:41:27] <+terraspan> Big rocks first for efficiency
[1:41:30] <EuropanLamprey> YAY MINECRAFT
[1:41:30] <%ArcanumArcanum> math is hard
[1:41:32] <%Broand> WELCOME TO MAFFS
[1:41:32] <NitronStreams> MATH
[1:41:36] <+Deekman> Buddy, you're a boy, make a big noise Playing in the street, gonna be a big man someday
[1:41:37] <%ArcanumArcanum> Pat the big rock, please
[1:41:37] <CappuccinoGuil> Break the pillars, Pat
[1:41:41] <%Broand> Mine the thing sticking out
[1:41:51] <%ArcanumArcanum> oh god
[1:41:54] <%holydeviant1> eh fair
[1:41:55] <mrblack499> pat make drills  in order to save time?
[1:41:56] <%Dunmarkh> NO
[1:41:57] <%crimsonharvest> its not 'extra' its like enough to put in your pockets, and its in the way
[1:41:57] <sonofthedeepsouth> He aint gonna use the pillars chat
[1:41:57] <%Spydurman> the math begins
[1:41:58] <%ArchimerCXV> pillars are one-time, floor is forever
[1:42:04] <+D00msDayDan> @PatStaresAt you can slidehop to go faster
[1:42:04] <gryffinp> Ok pat. you save those for the big boy shit.
[1:42:05] <%Jekado> you can't get the big boy stuff with the miner
[1:42:05] <NoCreditClear> The rocks break after like 6 hits. they only have like 45 iron in them.
[1:42:05] <sonofthedeepsouth> The pillars will be there forever
[1:42:05] <CappuccinoGuil> I love how HOT the craft button gets the more you make it LUL
[1:42:05] <%holydeviant1> Drills are soon
[1:42:08] <%Broand> But you can't mine with machines, you can only break them with hand
[1:42:09] <Darthkitten_Prime> Hey. fair enough
[1:42:10] <%ArcanumArcanum> you know what, it's fine chat. He will find out eventually
[1:42:10] <%Jekado> you have to HAND mine them
[1:42:13] <EuropanLamprey> Mathcraft begins
[1:42:16] <@commanderclaw> "But what if I need the bigger deposits for a boss fight?"
[1:42:17] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> They are like treasure chests, open the big rocks immediately
[1:42:22] <+Bentusi1634> Like when you make the drill and equip it just don't click and it will play an animation for it.
[1:42:23] <%Broand> The rock outcrops are broken by hand
[1:42:24] <Tytangamer> Pat, in the grand scheme those pillars ain't shit.
[1:42:29] <CappuccinoGuil> Pat, you can add a building to a to-do list and it'll tell you on screen how many materials you need
[1:42:32] <NitronStreams> NotLikeThis
[1:42:33] <%ArcanumArcanum> You can NEVER have enough Iron Plates
[1:42:33] <zedravan> LUL
[1:42:33] <boogaleeboo> You'll need them eventually, it's cool
[1:42:34] <mrblack499> ok
[1:42:34] <%Jekado> its fine
[1:42:39] <TG_Cid11> the plates are 3 iron to 2 plates
[1:42:39] <%Jekado> you'll need more plates
[1:42:40] <Darthkitten_Prime> Eh, you'll use them for something else later
[1:42:41] <%holydeviant1> @commanderclaw He'll need to break them to make room for the true automation later anyway
[1:42:41] <%crimsonharvest> those pillars are there to be smashed by hand
[1:42:41] <%Movemeister> Pat the digger
[1:42:42] <CrematedCube> There will never be enough plates
[1:42:47] <%JoshManVGH> Back up places, should the first fail
[1:42:47] <yeeyeyee> oh that's real good
[1:42:48] <+InvertableQuasar> It's really nice
[1:42:50] <$SGrim> @chat I just got home. Is this going the way we all expected?
[1:42:51] <NitronStreams> OH wow thats a great feaure
[1:42:52] <CappuccinoGuil> This feature should be in EVERY crafting game
[1:42:55] <%Movemeister> Will pierce the heavens
[1:42:56] <EuropanLamprey> You have to punch the tree to get the wood to make the crafting table to let you make the Axe
[1:42:57] <%valriot> bork
[1:42:59] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Pat, move the hub closer to the iron veins?
[1:43:01] <Tuna_Can_0> yes but how much air pollution can you cause? FeelsGoodMan
[1:43:01] <DazzlingFuhrer> how ironic
[1:43:02] <+Rofiarf> and you can stack them
[1:43:10] <+TheMorilo> just like real iron!
[1:43:13] <%CommanderSqueaks> BORK
[1:43:17] <+storebrandcandy> I. Ron. Butterfly
[1:43:19] <%crimsonharvest> its just a booster to get you going
[1:43:19] <gryffinp> The good news is that the ground stuff is infinite
[1:43:20] <NoCreditClear> They're more for seeing them on the horizon than anything else lol
[1:43:24] <CappuccinoGuil> IT'S SO FUCKING PRETTY
[1:43:27] <%Livelinne> psaDogchamp
[1:43:29] <%crimsonharvest> get ready for all the V A P O R W A V E colors
[1:43:32] <+InvertableQuasar> It's really weirdly pretty for a game of this type
[1:43:33] <%Broand> It really is, and there's a HUGE amount of biomes
[1:43:35] <gryffinp> I know right, they didn't need to make this game look so sexy
[1:43:36] <%holydeviant1> it is very pretty! And it has a lot of variety, shockingly
[1:43:39] <CrematedCube> And the world is nutso big
[1:43:42] <%furiousfurioso> now turn it into an industrial hellscape
[1:43:44] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> You keep running back and forth from the Hub, just put the hub immediately next to the veins for SPEED
[1:43:45] <AmuserName> NINTENDO, HIRE THIS FACTORY
[1:43:47] <%ArcanumArcanum> Yeah this game is chill as fuck, I love all the zones. Except the caves. Fuck the enemies in the caves
[1:43:50] <%valriot> Its pretty, and then you make stuff and ruin it LUL
[1:43:51] <%Jekado> its because its not procedurally generated
[1:43:52] <%crimsonharvest> you'll get tools for getting up
[1:43:55] <xbb1024> you can rotate the building
[1:43:58] <%depressed_skeleton> Dig up stupid
[1:43:59] <Veluren> Ready to turn it into an industrial hellscape full of machinery billowing out clouds of black smoke
[1:43:59] <+Bentusi1634> an important thing to know: The game has a 100% return rate on materials when you deconstruct.
[1:44:00] <$Trenr> that comes soon, don't worry
[1:44:02] <iosephe> Up comes later
[1:44:03] <NoCreditClear> You get a cheapo watchtower later to give you easy elevation
[1:44:04] <%Ranryu692> shouldn't you get Paige's help for that?
[1:44:05] <%Jekado> you can do that later
[1:44:07] <+Shackle_Rustyford> whats the over/under of pats creativity neurosis ruining this for him
[1:44:10] <%shruke> the make such a beautiful world for you to bulldoze
[1:44:11] <Jekado> you can build a tower
[1:44:12] <%holydeviant1> Good snap!
[1:44:13] <CappuccinoGuil> The to-do list ALSO applies for items in the workshop/bench.
[1:44:19] <blackbaron98> Down?
[1:44:19] <%Broand> Get used to that statementr
[1:44:21] <%holydeviant1> need more rods!
[1:44:22] <%Movemeister> Gotta get up to get down
[1:44:29] <+Rofiarf> build a lot of these
[1:44:34] <%holydeviant1> Pretty soon you'll be automating ALL OF THIS
[1:44:36] <gryffinp> remember when pat said "Oh I made too many plates" haha there is never enough.
[1:44:43] <CappuccinoGuil> Anything you want to craft can be added to the to-do list.
[1:44:47] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Build a Gulag!
[1:44:48] <%holydeviant1> never enough plates
[1:44:49] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Press esc while holding down the CRAFT button for auto craft, IIRC
[1:44:49] <%crimsonharvest> the workshop has a ladder on the back that works
[1:44:51] <%holydeviant1> never enough rods
[1:44:51] <EuropanLamprey> He's not going to make a Cube, he's going to make a mess
[1:44:54] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Unless they patched that
[1:44:57] <+Rofiarf> more pat, build more!
[1:45:03] <%Arancet> portable minors?
[1:45:06] <%holydeviant1> storage crates full of EVERYTHING is not enough
[1:45:07] <fiercefiresoul> Gotta keep those minors portable.
[1:45:17] <%DiscoMatador> Don't worry pat soone the beauty of nature will give way to the beauty of THE MACHINE
[1:45:17] <+Shackle_Rustyford> this gives me no mans sky vibes
[1:45:28] <%holydeviant1> You'll have to manually empty these boys
[1:45:28] <blackbaron98> Minors stay mobile
[1:45:30] <%hamborgini> drill friend
[1:45:30] <SpaceManHotepIV> Automation get
[1:45:31] <bonebagMEL> Everything in this game is animated SO GOOD
[1:45:35] <+Deekman> is this on console?
[1:45:36] <%holydeviant1> so uh, don't forget you place them
[1:45:43] <%Jekado> you can set the other one up too
[1:45:47] <@commanderclaw> All children are portable minors
[1:45:49] <%Broand> PC only iirc
[1:45:50] <NitronStreams> Iron Stonks are lookin good!
[1:45:56] <+Rofiarf> place the other too
[1:45:57] <boogaleeboo> You can just *go*
[1:45:58] <%Jekado> you can fit as many as you like
[1:46:00] <Jetsfantasy> Child labor LUL
[1:46:02] <%DiscoMatador> YES
[1:46:02] <%holydeviant1> HA, PAT, THIS ISN'T EVEN THE START
[1:46:03] <gryffinp> I think it just occured to pat that he can make like ten of those
[1:46:03] <artoflec> i was thinking of Factorio not Satisfactory
[1:46:08] <%Ranryu692> @commanderclaw LUL
[1:46:08] <jorniev> kinda like an rts?
[1:46:08] <%valriot> INDUSTRY
[1:46:10] <%Broand> It's not as efficient as one BIG miner tho
[1:46:14] <+Shackle_Rustyford> i dont like how their eyes look like they're grunting
[1:46:19] <zazzera01> wait until he gets the powered miners
[1:46:20] <%DianaTheAscian> do they walk back?
[1:46:21] <+JobbedBone> oh god ITS HITTING ALL THE INCREMENTAL BUTTONS
[1:46:21] <CappuccinoGuil> As long as you have space you can fit them. Each portable miner gets 100 iron
[1:46:21] <T_Sasquatch> we must seize the means of production
[1:46:23] <+TangoNango> He's starting to see the appeal...
[1:46:24] <+Rofiarf> also you use them later to build stuff, so feel free to make more
[1:46:24] <sonofthedeepsouth> CHAD INDUSTRY
[1:46:25] <%Jekado> its odd how these don't need to be powered
[1:46:25] <%holydeviant1> INDUSTRRYYYYYYYY
[1:46:28] <+TipsyND> So, how long until this game trigger Pat's OCD?
[1:46:29] <NoCreditClear> Pat cooms
[1:46:30] <%depressed_skeleton> Heck trees.
[1:46:31] <rufus2k2> AY AYRON
[1:46:31] <+BusterRepukken> Oh no, Pat is being sucked in
[1:46:32] <%blastyoboots> "You can just DO the work FOR ME?! :D" is the moment anyone gets addicted to Factorio or Satisfactory.  Automation is the name of the game and it is SO SATISFYING
[1:46:33] <GlukosWyvern> They max out at 100 so empty them regularly
[1:46:34] <%Arancet> I, Ron Butterfly
[1:46:35] <sonofthedeepsouth> DISREGARD NATURE AQUIRE TECH!
[1:46:35] <rufus2k2> AY AYRON!!
[1:46:35] <CrematedCube> Trees get in the way of progress
[1:46:38] <+ccwettr123> oh god its begun- Pat is learning the power of industry
[1:46:39] <jowi_time> LET THE PLANET CRACKING BEGIN!!!!
[1:46:40] <%holydeviant1> yeah it's kinda weird that they just go
[1:46:45] <%DiscoMatador> INDUSTRY GO BRRRRR
[1:46:46] <%depressed_skeleton> What have trees done for us lately? that's right, nuffin.
[1:46:52] <yeeyeyee> @Jekado they draw power from the heat of the drill
[1:46:53] <%Jekado> @tipsynd Not until he gets to Crude oil i feel so we won't see it.
[1:46:57] <theKingRamses> rock and stone
[1:46:57] <yeeyeyee> don't worry about it
[1:47:00] <Veluren> Eventually you can automate
[1:47:00] <%Cybercobra2> yea, build a smelter
[1:47:00] <NoCreditClear> not by hand
[1:47:01] <%ArcanumArcanum> Eventually, yes
[1:47:01] <%blastyoboots> NUMBER GO UP
[1:47:01] <%TIME_PUNCHER> This new No Man's Sky update looks nuts
[1:47:01] <%furiousfurioso> soon, yes
[1:47:01] <%Broand> Yes
[1:47:02] <NeroInfinite> Yes
[1:47:02] <CappuccinoGuil> Manually? No.
[1:47:03] <+InvertableQuasar> Give it time
[1:47:03] <%crimsonharvest> yeah keep unlocking tiers
[1:47:04] <%Agami23> of course there is.
[1:47:04] <+mczarklesby> I've heard stories of grown sheep dogs finally finding a heard of sheep and realizing their life's purpose in an instant. Same energy.
[1:47:04] <GunEden> later
[1:47:05] <+JobbedBone> of course :)
[1:47:05] <GlukosWyvern> Not yet
[1:47:05] <+TangoNango> Pretty soon you'll find out
[1:47:05] <%CommanderSqueaks> L A T E R
[1:47:06] <%hamborgini> yes, with a factory building
[1:47:06] <gryffinp> yes, you build a machine to do it
[1:47:06] <iosephe> Soon (tm)
[1:47:06] <+D00msDayDan> yes, build a factory
[1:47:06] <%king_wragles> Speed up your processor lol
[1:47:06] <+clonexsniper> go up in tech
[1:47:07] <+queaks> that's the game
[1:47:07] <%Dunmarkh> need moar upgrades
[1:47:07] <xbb1024> yes, higher tier
[1:47:07] <%holydeviant1> Not until you have a manufacturer
[1:47:07] <+AdrianSitsDown> There's a way to do everything faster
[1:47:07] <CrematedCube> Soon
[1:47:08] <%Broand> you'll see
[1:47:08] <zazzera01> you can automate everything eventually
[1:47:11] <chaosbringer28> through automation
[1:47:11] <%darklordfodder> There will be assembly machines.
[1:47:12] <rcand9> hows satisfactory going is it a big Epiphany or is pat living a nightmare?
[1:47:12] <Veluren> You can automate EVERYTHING eventualy
[1:47:12] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Automate it.
[1:47:13] <+Rofiarf> automation later on
[1:47:13] <NeroInfinite> YEp
[1:47:14] <boogaleeboo> It's building fundamentals
[1:47:16] <%depressed_skeleton> lil baby man
[1:47:17] <Psyramics> you're gonna be automating it eventually
[1:47:17] <CappuccinoGuil> Yup. You'll automate soon enough
[1:47:19] <%CommanderSqueaks> Have patience, young Pat.
[1:47:21] <%DianaTheAscian> Did you just learn the beauty of automation? @PatStaresAt
[1:47:22] <%holydeviant1> Soon this will all be automated
[1:47:22] <+Rofiarf> yeah
[1:47:22] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> This is to make you want to automate.
[1:47:23] <%Jekado> yes... automation... happens...
[1:47:23] <%Agami23> pat. this game is an OCD wet dream. you will be loving this.
[1:47:28] <%Smeagleman6> Everything will be automated soon
[1:47:32] <%Dunmarkh> gotta get them conveyor belts and shit
[1:47:33] <NoCreditClear> You hold the mouse button down now so you can appreciate when you're getting hundreds a second without doing anything.
[1:47:33] <+Rofiarf> this game is about making production lines
[1:47:34] <$Trenr> it's like the early stages of cookie clicker, where you have to manually click. it doesn't last very long.
[1:47:38] <+Bentusi1634> The devs said they did this this way to ensure players understood that doing things manually sucked and it was worth the effort to automate.
[1:47:39] <NitronStreams> From what I've seen this game has Alot of ways to automate certain processes
[1:47:39] <%ArcanumArcanum> @rcand9 he's still in baby tutorial mode. The mindgoblin parts havent happened yet
[1:47:40] <+JobbedBone> giving the player pain-points to alleviate later Kreygasm
[1:47:41] <%Cybercobra2> soon enough you should pretty much never need to handle raw ore ever again
[1:47:46] <%notsoy> you should turn the workshop around so you don't have to go around every time
[1:47:52] <BwdYeti> The game is teaching you to hate doing it manually so you automate it
[1:47:58] <%Broand> I'd recommend continuing the main thing before building a million portable miners
[1:48:00] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Don't you hate holding this button? Wouldn't it be nice if you constructed a giant button-pressing rube goldberg contraption?
[1:48:01] <gryffinp> satisfactory is a game built around going "here, do this thing" and then you do it and it goes "it sucked right?" and then five minutes later it goes "here's a machine to do that for you" and you go "FUCK YES" even though the game is solving a problem that it made for you
[1:48:05] <xlander27> I've never played this, but apparently;y everything will be automated soon XD
[1:48:08] <gryffinp> its great
[1:48:08] <%rumtumtugnutz> there's a door you can use to get into your equipment bay, Pat.
[1:48:24] <yourliteraldog> BIG BLIND
[1:48:25] <NeroInfinite> YOU FOOL. LUL
[1:48:27] <%crimsonharvest> The ladder work
[1:48:28] <+D00msDayDan> i'm loving this
[1:48:28] <%hamborgini> there's a ladder too for when you want to get up
[1:48:29] <iosephe> efficiency go up

[1:48:32] <+BusterRepukken> LMAO
[1:48:33] <GlukosWyvern> lol
[1:48:33] <Veluren> Proceed to not use it
[1:48:34] <+Rofiarf> its okay, you need a lot of plates for later
[1:48:36] <gryffinp> and then he walks around it anyway
[1:48:37] <NeroInfinite> STILL GOIGNA ROUDN IT ALLT HE WAY
[1:48:38] <goose_coward> efficiency get
[1:48:39] <%SWFanatic> Eyes have yet to open
[1:48:40] <Psyramics> he immediately forgot about the door
[1:48:41] <yourliteraldog> If you flip it you can have an easier time
[1:48:41] <RzdAkira> Still walked around LUL
[1:48:43] <%ArcanumArcanum> Harvest your miners
[1:48:52] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Move the hub as close as possible to the iron vein?
[1:48:52] <Psyramics> why are you digging it still
[1:48:53] <%Jekado> you have the drills
[1:48:56] <%Spydurman> still walked around LUL
[1:48:56] <+Rofiarf> you miners pat
[1:48:57] <+clonexsniper> you can also just look at the building and access it through the wall
[1:49:01] <%Jekado> the drills fill up fast
[1:49:04] <%darklordfodder> Your current miners will stop when their inventory fills.
[1:49:07] <+JobbedBone> hes making more
[1:49:07] <yourliteraldog> Milk the drill
[1:49:08] <NeroInfinite> You have drills
[1:49:09] <%Jekado> you need to clear them out
[1:49:09] <goose_coward> again
[1:49:11] <%holydeviant1> >Three hours later: I NEED MORE CONVEYOR BELTS
[1:49:11] <+Shady_Zaku> still went arounf
[1:49:12] <+Rofiarf> your miners are full pat go empty them out
[1:49:13] <yourliteraldog> It's tummy is full
[1:49:16] <RzdAkira> Your portable miners only have one slot of 100
[1:49:19] <CrematedCube> This game is a perfect storm of order vs chaos
[1:49:21] <+superblar> You can do a sick slide while sprinting, and then long jump out of it to go faster
[1:49:26] <%Jekado> the funny thing is he'll need to build a ton of those later
[1:49:33] <LVL1_Scumbag> Pat seems like he's having a sexual awakening
[1:49:36] <%CommanderSqueaks> Serotonin go up.
[1:49:36] <CappuccinoGuil> I can't wait to see how he reacts in 15 minutes LUL

[2:02:18] <%holydeviant1> I DIDN'T KNOW
[2:02:19] <+TipsyND> infinit ressources is the best part of this game
[2:02:20] <%AncelDeLambert> psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead
[2:02:21] <sonofthedeepsouth> >infinite
[2:02:22] <boogaleeboo> This game wants to help you. Always help you, always make it easy.
[2:02:23] <%Bentusi1634> Satisfactory also has trains
[2:02:25] <+ReallyBigRocks> I DIDN"T KNOW ABOUT THAT
[2:02:25] <%Jekado> its good early game
[2:02:26] <heartlesshealer> I hit a macro on my keyboard by accident going to type "HE BABY <3 " that put my computer to sleep and I couldn't stop it
[2:02:26] <+MooseIsGoose> GAMER moves
[2:02:28] <Ipsenscastle> Pat seems surprisingly hype
[2:02:29] <%Jekado> since later its not as needed
[2:02:30] <%Broken_Sonex> Now THAT'S POGGERS
[2:02:31] <%Aeoneth> Award that person channel points
[2:02:32] <+queaks> gotchu fam
[2:02:33] <%SWFanatic> psaBlind psaUp
[2:02:34] <+PersonifiedTFT> @ArcanumArcanum not early game
[2:02:34] <%VHGS> it's like you're also a robot now
[2:02:36] <+JobbedBone> wait no loop hero is tomorrow
[2:02:37] <%holydeviant1> Biomass is anything that burns, by the way, but you can refine it at the workbench
[2:02:38] <+Deekman> wait what was the pro tip?
[2:02:38] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat, you have enough, the game AUTOMATES THIS
[2:02:44] <Tuna_Can_0> I mean you're meant to expand in factorio atpCap
[2:02:44] <OneThousandTomatoes> you could have been doing this while cleaning geif
[2:02:45] <+Shackle_Rustyford> whats the deal with dyson sphere
[2:02:46] <R1DDL3Y> watch number go up
[2:02:47] <%Puhff> PotG
[2:02:48] <%NopeBadguy> why does this sound like the beat to We Will Rock You
[2:02:49] <kazadaz> the hypest content on twitch
[2:02:50] <%Broand> Now you are the autominer
[2:02:51] <%holydeviant1> From logs and leaves to clumps, from clumps to concentrated logs
[2:02:51] <%notsoy> check the thing now
[2:02:51] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat, please, you build robots to do this
[2:02:53] <+SocialMisfitGamer> Autosave Counter!? Sick!
[2:02:56] <%darklordfodder> Uhhh....I tihnk you have enough for the NEXT step lol
[2:02:57] <%whyskeywolfe> Pro Gamer Move: Not Actually Gaming Style
[2:03:04] <gryffinp> I mean, might as well leave the miner there
[2:03:05] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Leave it there!
[2:03:05] <+mcburgers3000> We are teaching the kids that mining has no negative impacts! Yay!
[2:03:08] <%DiscoMatador> I am playing Factorio While watching this
[2:03:10] <%Cybercobra2> NUT
[2:03:11] <gryffinp> so that the next time you go back there's a fresh hundred
[2:03:11] <Veluren> Eat food, nuts and berries
[2:03:12] <%Broand> eat berries and junk
[2:03:13] <triggersqueeze1985> Beat that copper into submission
[2:03:13] <xbb1024> eat the nut
[2:03:14] <bonebagMEL> fruits heal
[2:03:15] <+queaks> food
[2:03:17] <Griffin1171> berryies
[2:03:17] <%hamborgini> heal with nut
[2:03:17] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Why take it back? You think you're done with copper?
[2:03:18] <+Shady_Zaku> WOO ultimate technique
[2:03:18] <OneThousandTomatoes> are leaves biomass?
[2:03:19] <+ReallyBigRocks> consume nut Patrick
[2:03:20] <$ZeOrbling> @Deekman opening the inventory while mining lets you take your hand off the mouse and continue mining
[2:03:21] <%Bentusi1634> Nothing is better for your health then a balanced diet
[2:03:22] <GelatinFellow> consume nut for health go high
[2:03:23] <heartlesshealer> maybe build a food
[2:03:24] <$pale_salamander> eat nut
[2:03:26] <%holydeviant1> Nuts and berries heal ye
[2:03:26] <+JobbedBone> @NopeBadguy its like three notes and two are the same.
[2:03:27] <softbirby> can here gief chompin
[2:03:28] <+PersonifiedTFT> CONSUME NUT TO HEAL
[2:03:29] <ammobasket> By the time your patches run out in Factorio, your base is super huge anyway
[2:03:31] <%darklordfodder> I might have to jump back into this game. I tried it super early and went right back to Factorio.
[2:03:33] <triggersqueeze1985> Jabornii
[2:03:38] <%Cybercobra2> YEA, FUCK THAT WILDLIFE JUST TRYING TO SURVIVE
[2:03:40] <OneThousandTomatoes> durifuto
[2:03:41] <kazadaz> jesus those things can move
[2:03:43] <+Stormzcales_Lair> DBZ rhino
[2:03:43] <absolute_cagemony> I just got here, has Pat said anything insane yet?
[2:03:46] <%depressed_skeleton> i hate those things so fucking much
[2:03:46] <R1DDL3Y> Monster drifted
[2:03:49] <Veluren> Shift is sprint, also
[2:03:50] <%Broand> look at white rock
[2:03:50] <%DireHamster> DireHamster subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 21 months! 
[2:03:51] <Veluren> No stnaima
[2:03:52] <%ArcanumArcanum> @Personified134 all you need to do is automate the process of turning leaves and wood into biomass It's super easy to make it a non-issue until you get coal power
[2:04:00] <mrblack499> is there farming in this game?
[2:04:04] <%Jekado> quarts
[2:04:09] <%Jekado> no
[2:04:11] <OneThousandTomatoes> why do they always show up out of nowhere
[2:04:11] <NoCreditClear> @mrblack499 there's a mod for it
[2:04:12] <gryffinp> @mrblack499 No but there's a mod
[2:04:15] <%holydeviant1> You will hate these dogs within an hour, gaurenteed
[2:04:16] <triggersqueeze1985> Finding Nemo references
[2:04:16] <+MooseIsGoose> I can not tell weather the snorts from the enemies are from the game or the Dog and I love it
[2:04:24] <TurtlesAndTentacles> I remember watchign some rooster teeth people, Neebs gamng play this. I think Pat will do much better
[2:04:29] <mrblack499> thanks
[2:04:31] <heartlesshealer> ENJOY TERRAIN
[2:04:33] <kazadaz> i can SIIIIIING
[2:04:34] <%Bentusi1634> Hit C while running
[2:04:39] <gryffinp> agreed, hold to sprint sucks
[2:04:43] <%takotoots> speed
[2:04:44] <%Jekado> always run
[2:04:47] <NoCreditClear> ayyy best option is now in play.
[2:04:50] <%Jekado> yeah SLIDE
[2:04:53] <%CommanderSqueaks> Why does this game movement tech?
[2:04:54] <%Bentusi1634> as long as its a down slope you keep going
[2:04:55] <gryffinp> Hey pat, remember warframe and titanfall?
[2:04:56] <NoCreditClear> Titanfall slide jumps weeeee
[2:04:59] <%SWFanatic> all your base
[2:05:00] <+Deekman> wtf was that in the sky?
[2:05:01] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Slide jump is fastest way to move, i think.
[2:05:01] <risenlp2> Nut-sack Tic
[2:05:04] <Yakobro> NUT
[2:05:04] <rcand9> hey pat im getting through yakuza 4 it starts strong akiyama is amazing why did no one tell me hes so good
[2:05:09] <+D00msDayDan> it's crazy how strong slidehopping is
[2:05:11] <%holydeviant1> PROTIP: animals cannot damage your base, just you.
[2:05:15] <heartlesshealer> big and leg
[2:05:16] <PinoProxie> CONSUME NUT
[2:05:16] <%darklordfodder> Eventually/soon you get a jetpack.
[2:05:17] <+InvertableQuasar> Delicious nut
[2:05:22] <%SirGO0SE> 😳
[2:05:22] <risenlp2> NUT
[2:05:24] <triggersqueeze1985> Siltstriders????
[2:05:26] <+superblar> Jump when you're sliding to move faster as well
[2:05:27] <caffeinatedboy> heh Nut
[2:05:29] <%holydeviant1> REFINE THAT SHIT
[2:05:30] <%TheWinged7> phrasing pat
[2:05:32] <%Maids4lyfe> nut
[2:05:35] <%Movemeister> soft nut
[2:05:36] <LVL1_Scumbag> Optimal nutt
[2:05:37] <BerryliciousDefinition> Got that good nut
[2:05:40] <%notsoy> MAKE SMELTER
[2:05:41] <+Berb64> Spitenut
[2:05:43] <%vivaldiva> psaBig nut
[2:05:44] <zazzera01> both sides of the crafting table work
[2:05:48] <%Jekado> eingets
[2:05:49] <rcand9> primal nut
[2:05:51] <absolute_cagemony> EYEngots?????
[2:05:55] <triggersqueeze1985> Nut clarity
[2:05:55] <sonofthedeepsouth> Need shit
[2:06:02] <mrblack499> pat knows how to eat a nut?
[2:06:02] <%depressed_skeleton> Criokey
[2:06:07] <NoCreditClear> Pat is having a good time because accents are  happening.
[2:06:14] <imadavedave> you can hold space instead of mouse for hand crafting
[2:06:14] <+queaks> put your phone on the space bar for lots of crafting
[2:06:18] <%holydeviant1> You will soon have shipping crates worth of storage space
[2:06:27] <%PocketBearIllustrator> Pat's over here appropriating the Australians. :P
[2:06:43] <+UltraViolet371> wow you sound like my professor
[2:06:43] <triggersqueeze1985> Damn good Wolverine impression
[2:06:47] <+Rofiarf> next to your power
[2:06:48] <TheWinged7> @PatStaresAt can you mean Paiges Dealter to go with
[2:06:51] <%Broand> oh nah ees tahned into a true blue ozzie
[2:06:51] <%holydeviant1> make sure you have a lot of room at both ends
[2:06:52] <%SwdVengeance> Build the dealter next
[2:06:55] <%holydeviant1> like
[2:06:57] <%CommanderSqueaks> So did Pat find his new crack?
[2:06:58] <xbb1024> leave some space for your input/output
[2:06:58] <boogaleeboo> Orange is in, green is out
[2:06:58] <%holydeviant1> A LOT
[2:06:58] <gryffinp> Pat's on some weird shit today
[2:07:00] <+queaks> orange in green out
[2:07:07] <%furiousfurioso> put the orange end close to the ore
[2:07:07] <NitronStreams> OH YEAH
[2:07:08] <heartlesshealer> Keep in mind those input/output directions
[2:07:08] <%BinaryFireball> right there
[2:07:10] <gryffinp> oh no
[2:07:11] <%dj_xo98> Not enough swears to be Australian but good try LUL
[2:07:12] <VTuberEloiyse> my EYES
[2:07:12] <%BinaryFireball> in the blurry zone
[2:07:13] <%Treuan> H-he's fasy
[2:07:16] <%Broand> Here we go
[2:07:17] <%holydeviant1> Point the input at the iron deposit
[2:07:21] <ulcaban> @PocketBearIllustrator The closest to appropriate Pat gets!
[2:07:21] <%Movemeister> The Australian Simpson's episode is all I need to know about Australia
[2:07:22] <%holydeviant1> trust me
[2:07:23] <LoreKeeper_Thal> tha's roight, 'innit?
[2:07:25] <+Rofiarf> point it to the left
[2:07:27] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Middle click with the build tool is the eyedropper for copying blueprints. Saves time.
[2:07:32] <Tuna_Can_0> atpRtsd3 atpRtsd4
[2:07:33] <%SWFanatic> when did pat become michael caine
[2:07:34] <absolute_cagemony> So is Pat's dick huge for crafting/survival games now?
[2:07:36] <+TipsyND> Build a floor you savage
[2:07:36] <$Trenr> it won't matter
[2:07:37] <%Broand> Clean comes later
[2:07:41] <+queaks> you'll end up moving it
[2:07:43] <triggersqueeze1985> Midgar recreation
[2:07:43] <heartlesshealer> make sure you can access both sides
[2:07:44] <$Trenr> you're gonna move it in an hour
[2:07:44] <blink289> that was a weird new ff14 comercial
[2:07:44] <%Cybercobra2> dont worry, you get everything back when you dissasemble buildings and its really quick.
[2:07:45] <boogaleeboo> It make the power!
[2:07:46] <+NecDW4> Nice and clean.. oh pat
[2:07:46] <%holydeviant1> yes
[2:07:48] <%depressed_skeleton> Generator
[2:07:48] <%notsoy> don't you have to connect the smelter to power?
[2:07:48] <%BinaryFireball> it burns things
[2:07:52] <dexdestroyazz> Building floors allows snapping for easier spacing
[2:07:53] <%Aeoneth> The Goblins Advance....
[2:07:57] <+Rofiarf> press 2 pat
[2:07:57] <%holydeviant1> YES
[2:07:58] <%ArcanumArcanum> with wire
[2:07:59] <%crimsonharvest> yes pat
[2:08:00] <%holydeviant1> YES GOOD
[2:08:01] <+superblar> When you break them down to move them you get all the materials back too, so don't worry about putting something in the wrong place
[2:08:03] <gryffinp> yep
[2:08:03] <%depressed_skeleton> Using what pat, come on
[2:08:03] <%Broand> yes
[2:08:09] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Connect burner to a power pole to a smelter, not directly to smelter.
[2:08:10] <%holydeviant1> WITH THAT
[2:08:11] <triggersqueeze1985> Big mass
[2:08:13] <mrblack499> yes
[2:08:13] <%holydeviant1> YOU CONNECT WITH THAT
[2:08:13] <sonofthedeepsouth> ELETRICITY
[2:08:14] <Tuna_Can_0> but does it PULP?
[2:08:15] <heartlesshealer> yes but how
[2:08:16] <%darklordfodder> First lesson: Fail fast, rebuild often.
[2:08:19] <%ArcanumArcanum> you need to make power go from the burner to the smelter
[2:08:21] <LorcaNomad> is he doing it!?
[2:08:27] <Veluren> So here's something fun, when I was first playing this game was also when I was using you playing Deadly Premonition 2 in the background, so you, this game, and DP are irretrievably entwined in my mind now
[2:08:27] <gryffinp> you gotta get a little cable
[2:08:29] <NoCreditClear> Remember Pat: 100% refunds on disassembled buildings.
[2:08:30] <+D00msDayDan> but the smelter next to the dealter
[2:08:34] <gryffinp> That should be fine
[2:08:37] <%notsoy> point orange end towards resource
[2:08:40] <+Rofiarf> now get cables for power lines
[2:08:41] <%holydeviant1> Meet your first automated processing unit!
[2:08:46] <sonofthedeepsouth> It needs power pst
[2:08:47] <%holydeviant1> Connect it to power, Pat!
[2:08:47] <%crimsonharvest> just needs power now
[2:08:48] <%ArcanumArcanum> It needs power
[2:08:49] <heartlesshealer> okay, now research your connecting parts
[2:08:51] <%holydeviant1> With a cable!
[2:08:51] <%TheWinged7> it needs power
[2:09:01] <%holydeviant1> yes
[2:09:14] <caffeinatedboy> Veluren I have that same thing but with Mario Odyssey and a Glass Animals album for some strange reason
[2:09:26] <%Jekado> yeah
[2:09:27] <%holydeviant1> YEAH
[2:09:29] <+Rofiarf> put some leaves in it
[2:09:32] <%Jekado> wire is automatic
[2:09:33] <nilla_24> it's like fallout 4
[2:09:36] <+Rofiarf> leaves or wood
[2:09:37] <OneThousandTomatoes> gonna trip the lanky bois
[2:09:38] <%holydeviant1> just shove logs in
[2:09:38] <sonofthedeepsouth> LEAVES
[2:09:39] <%ArcanumArcanum> shove that grass and wood in there
[2:09:40] <gryffinp> plant
[2:09:40] <+NecDW4> LEAVES
[2:09:40] <triggersqueeze1985> Force lightning
[2:09:41] <%holydeviant1> for now
[2:09:41] <%crimsonharvest> grab a few hundred leaves and stuff it all in there
[2:09:41] <+InvertableQuasar> Wood
[2:09:41] <Veluren> Alien parts, leaves, wood, anything organic
[2:09:42] <%BinaryFireball> that elephant thing
[2:09:44] <%holydeviant1> just logs
[2:09:45] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Connect burner to smelter with a powerline, otherwise you got problems later.
[2:09:45] <%notsoy> leaves, wood, maybe carapace?
[2:09:45] <%hamborgini> throw yourself in, it'll be fine
[2:09:45] <%Jekado> you have to used leaves or wood for now
[2:09:46] <+Rofiarf> or the carapace
[2:09:47] <%Broand> Just pick some leaves and slap it in there for now
[2:09:47] <%depressed_skeleton> Flowers
[2:09:48] <NoCreditClear> leaves and monster meat
[2:09:49] <heartlesshealer> plant stuff
[2:09:50] <+D00msDayDan> turn leaves and wood into biomass for more efficiency
[2:09:51] <absolute_cagemony> Pat's butt is a big biomass
[2:09:52] <%BinaryFireball> FARGO SOME SHIT
[2:09:54] <%JumboCrunchies> Are leaves Biomass?
[2:09:57] <+NecDW4> Or does Pat only know about non biological leaves?
[2:10:04] <%ArcanumArcanum> @D00msDayDan I dont think he can yet
[2:10:05] <%holydeviant1> Before you put the wood into the burner, load up the smelter
[2:10:08] <Griffin1171> break out the lawnmover
[2:10:08] <absolute_cagemony> Synthetic leaves
[2:10:11] <blink289> Just wait till pat has to build a network of power poles to plug in more than 1 thing
[2:10:19] <+JobbedBone> I'm making Spam fries in the air fryer who wants some.
[2:10:22] <%holydeviant1> QUICK, LOAD THE SMLETER
[2:10:24] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Burner and smelter each get one connection, powerlines get 4. Connecting burner straight to smelter prevents you connecting anything else.
[2:10:26] <+Rofiarf> put some ore in the smelter
[2:10:29] <gryffinp> carapace has better uses than being fuel, I'd suggest using leaves
[2:10:32] <triggersqueeze1985> This is pretty similar to space engineers
[2:10:34] <SpaceManHotepIV> smeelter
[2:10:40] <+superblar> Save the alien parts for research. Use the leaves first
[2:10:41] <%Broand> it'll consume slowly because you're only using a little power
[2:10:44] <%holydeviant1> YEAAAAH
[2:10:48] <absolute_cagemony> Yeah gurl, Im gonna load my big ore into your smelter..
[2:10:50] <Veluren> You did it!
[2:10:53] <heartlesshealer> yay
[2:10:54] <+silentblast93> so is pat just playing this?
[2:10:57] <NitronStreams> 👏👏👏👏👏
[2:10:57] <+Pixel_Matt> FeelsGoodMan
[2:10:58] <+ReallyBigRocks> yay!
[2:10:59] <heartlesshealer> POLLUTION! YAY
[2:11:01] <zazzera01> now it begins
[2:11:02] <+silentblast93> * just now
[2:11:03] <%hamborgini> look at all the smoke! industry just as god intended
[2:11:04] <%holydeviant1> Now, uh, you'll have to check that like an auto-miner, because it's not outputting to a storage
[2:11:07] <+SocialMisfitGamer> Is this just Dr.Stone but a video game and NOT anime?
[2:11:08] <%depressed_skeleton> pat what if TWO smelters tho?...
[2:11:09] <sonofthedeepsouth> CHAD BLACK SMOKE
[2:11:10] <PinoProxie> I'm delting
[2:11:10] <+Rofiarf> now get the tech for a proper miner building
[2:11:11] <%Valdorick> YOU ARE THE SMELTER DELTER
[2:11:13] <%depressed_skeleton> Fuck the planet
[2:11:13] <sonofthedeepsouth> FUCK YEAH
[2:11:14] <boogaleeboo> You are messing this biosphere UP
[2:11:15] <%ArcanumArcanum> @silentblast93 yeah its his first time and he's doing the tutorial still
[2:11:17] <+JobbedBone> WONDER BREAD PLANET!
[2:11:18] <%depressed_skeleton> its some gross alien planet
[2:11:20] <%PocketBearIllustrator> So how similar is this game to No Man's Sky?
[2:11:22] <%VoidBaronJules> f the not earth too
[2:11:22] <+storebrandcandy> looting and polluting IS the way
[2:11:22] <%Crunkle_Dunkle> why wouldn't you pollute
[2:11:24] <blue8moon> pat doesn't care about the environment
[2:11:26] <%JoshManVGH> Don't have a horrible smelting accident!
[2:11:28] <%crimsonharvest> pat just make more smelters
[2:11:29] <+Skelegroove> On the path to making a clean stainless world
[2:11:30] <%AzureGale> LOOTING AND POLLUTING IS NOT THE WAY
[2:11:31] <+Stormzcales_Lair> Is  pollution measured in this?
[2:11:31] <Mr_Rakjo> @PatStaresAt Make the Sky Gray, Glory to SCIENCE!
[2:11:31] <Dreigun> air litter
[2:11:32] <EuropanLamprey> Countdown until Pat turns this Planet into Venus
[2:11:34] <%Broand> Not similar at all pocket bear
[2:11:35] <%Treuan> Polution is just littering on a wider scale
[2:11:37] <+ReallyBigRocks> hell yeah, fuck this pristine alien landscape. Its time for MACHINES
[2:11:38] <%TheWinged7> @PatStaresAt you should get paige to join so she can make you a Dealter Kappa
[2:11:39] <+PersonifiedTFT> @PocketBearIllustrator not at all
[2:11:41] <imadavedave> sapace bar
[2:11:42] <$Dakuu75> "Looting and polluting, is-not the-way, hear what captain planet, has to say~"
[2:11:44] <triggersqueeze1985> LA that fuck outta the atmosphere
[2:11:44] <%ArcanumArcanum> @Stormzcales_Lair nah it's not
[2:11:45] <+Shackle_Rustyford> *builds automated smelter* *proceeds to manually smelt*
[2:11:45] <+lanik745> capitalism
[2:11:47] <%Jekado> pat needs concrete to make more power
[2:11:47] <jorniev> PAT IS BASICALLY A RAVAGER FROM STELLARIS
[2:11:50] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Why not make more smelters?
[2:11:53] <%Jekado> because he can't chain them
[2:11:53] <%Movemeister> Glory to mankind
[2:11:58] <heartlesshealer> surely there's no aggressive environmental repercussions to expanding in the future
[2:12:03] <%Broand> thats ingots
[2:12:15] <%Broand> you can pick up ingots from your smelter
[2:12:17] <Psyramics> why are you crafting them, go get them from the smelter
[2:12:18] <+silentblast93> @PatStaresAt pat you can hold the craft button
[2:12:20] <+Shackle_Rustyford> chat lag
[2:12:21] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> There is one repercussion at the tail end of the game.
[2:12:23] <CrematedCube> The little numbers are so helpful
[2:12:23] <OneThousandTomatoes> anyone else getting a thing where the stream skips back a bit then after a few seconds skips forward? I've been getting it for the past few days across multiple streamers.
[2:12:28] <heartlesshealer> yeah, good number feature
[2:12:32] <%Aeoneth> @heartlesshealer no... he must become Vex and turn the entire plnet into a Giant computer
[2:12:35] <NoCreditClear> [anything happens in Satisfactory] Pat: "I love that"
[2:12:36] <triggersqueeze1985> Put the Smaug in Smog
[2:12:37] <+JobbedBone> nope
[2:12:38] <+PersonifiedTFT> Pat you have a smelter to do this for you
[2:12:40] <blink289> If we were to magically teleport all of earth to a fresh earth like world how fast do you think we could destroy the environment
[2:12:46] <%holydeviant1> @Spudnacious_Dynasty Oh, right, when plants start making waste
[2:12:50] <heartlesshealer> @Aeoneth oh man
[2:12:55] <wolfen091> @onethousandtomatoes its internet ghosts
[2:12:55] <%Broand> 30 ingots per minute
[2:12:56] <LorcaNomad> that is a lot of eyeron
[2:12:57] <%whyskeywolfe> @OneThousandTomatoes Oh heck yeah.
[2:13:03] <jumpyhugs> so it's like slime rancher, but not for babies
[2:13:09] <%notsoy> refill the ore in the smelter too
[2:13:17] <+HitchhikingThrough> so does he love it or does he hate it
[2:13:26] <%holydeviant1> Can't wait until he has fully automated assembly lines
[2:13:31] <+Shackle_Rustyford> he hoves it
[2:13:31] <NitronStreams> Big drugs
[2:13:32] <gryffinp> its going well so far
[2:13:32] <%rumtumtugnutz> you should check on your drill robots, they might be full
[2:13:34] <%holydeviant1> that is when shit really takes off
[2:13:36] <%Broand> He's liking it
[2:13:37] <+JobbedBone> preying plortnite DansGame
[2:13:41] <%VoidBaronJules> brain goblins say good
[2:13:42] <OneThousandTomatoes> big endorphins
[2:13:50] <%jarednotwithsubway> @blink289 if we really tried? like a month
[2:13:50] <+Shackle_Rustyford> waiting for the creativity neurosis to begin
[2:13:55] <%rumtumtugnutz> @blink289 10 years, give or take.
[2:14:02] <CrematedCube> There's been a lot of satisfied groaning
[2:14:05] <LorcaNomad> I mean it's a lot of leaves
[2:14:08] <@commanderclaw> Strip the earth for it's resources
[2:14:08] <bonebagMEL> leaf not good, improve biomass always
[2:14:09] <gryffinp> gotta get through that tech tree and find a better way
[2:14:11] <%ArcanumArcanum> It will last almost 4 minutes
[2:14:12] <+Rofiarf> change recipe
[2:14:16] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Shift click moves a stack over into/out of something instantly.
[2:14:22] <%holydeviant1> @Shackle_Rustyford They'll hit once he unlocks storage, builders, and miners
[2:14:26] <NitronStreams> Coppore
[2:14:30] <%ArcanumArcanum> but actually longer since it's not running at max power
[2:14:34] <%holydeviant1> Either this teir or the next
[2:14:34] <blink289> craft the leaves pat
[2:14:37] <boogaleeboo> And now it'll start really opening up
[2:14:38] <%depressed_skeleton> No one tell pat about foundations. that'll destroy him.
[2:14:39] <+mcburgers3000> You need to do big murder for more electricity.
[2:14:41] <gryffinp> @BoneBagMel can't improve yet, technology not there
[2:14:42] <%holydeviant1> HOUSE
[2:15:00] <xbb1024> Concrete
[2:15:01] <%rumtumtugnutz> Copp-Or is my favorite Thundercats villain.
[2:15:01] <triggersqueeze1985> G’day irwon
[2:15:01] <%holydeviant1> >Limestone DO YOU LIKE FLAT PLANES, PAT
[2:15:08] <%Cybercobra2> now we get to the REAL shit.
[2:15:09] <%holydeviant1> DO YOU LIKE FLAT, EFFICIENT PLANES
[2:15:12] <gryffinp> no flat planes yet
[2:15:13] <+TipsyND> You can never have enough concrete, NEVER
[2:15:15] <gryffinp> that's tier 1
[2:15:18] <%holydeviant1> HERE WE FUCKING GO
[2:15:20] <+Deekman> god look at all that black smoke you're pumping in to the pure atmosphere
[2:15:20] <%crimsonharvest> like an ingot into a plate
[2:15:24] <+Rofiarf> so ingot to rods
[2:15:25] <%DiscoMatador> Turn Ingot into Plate
[2:15:26] <$HyperionXV> auto-crafter
[2:15:26] <%darklordfodder> iron ingots -> plates etc
[2:15:26] <bonebagMEL> It's an automated workbench
[2:15:27] <zedravan> auto craft
[2:15:27] <%ArcanumArcanum> it can turn iron ingots into plates or rods
[2:15:27] <%holydeviant1> Makes ingots into plates, for example
[2:15:28] <$Dakuu75> sounds like a decepticon
[2:15:28] <NitronStreams> automatic crafting
[2:15:28] <+HitchhikingThrough> AND SO IT BEGINS
[2:15:29] <+queaks> your base has an inside now!!
[2:15:29] <+patel347> automated crafting
[2:15:31] <%TheWinged7> auto churn out of crafted materials
[2:15:32] <bonebagMEL> here it begins the game
[2:15:34] <boogaleeboo> So you can smelt iron, feed the iron to the constructor, and that will make plates
[2:15:34] <LorcaNomad> this machine builds another machine?
[2:15:36] <OneThousandTomatoes> automation time
[2:15:36] <%Broand> iron ingot is part, iron rod is part
[2:15:37] <+JobbedBone> GENERIC ASSEMBLY LINES PogChamp
[2:15:37] <%DiscoMatador> turn ingot into rod
[2:15:38] <%Cybercobra2> so smelter > constructor for INFINITE PLATES
[2:15:41] <%holydeviant1> IT CRAFTS FOR YOU
[2:15:41] <blink289> so you dont have to craft yourself
[2:15:47] <+terraspan> auto workbench
[2:15:48] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> No no, conveyors is the start.
[2:15:51] <+Deekman> dumb question is there some kind of story or end state to this game?
[2:16:01] <%notsoy> wait, do you put the constructor next to the smelter to auto-make?
[2:16:01] <%darklordfodder> Wow they wait a LONG time to give you belts.
[2:16:02] <%SWFanatic> help computer
[2:16:04] <+Rofiarf> no
[2:16:05] <NoCreditClear> arguably it doens't really start unti lsplitters/mergers
[2:16:06] <%GeneralSCPatton> I had to take a 20 minute work call. Is he successfully doing git?
[2:16:09] <+Stormzcales_Lair> is there weather ? so you heveta hide insid e?
[2:16:09] <OneThousandTomatoes> is the multiplayer?
[2:16:11] <gryffinp> @Deekman not yet, supposedly it will be in the 1.0 release at the end of early access
[2:16:13] <%SWFanatic> stop all the downloadin
[2:16:14] <%holydeviant1> @Deekman I think there's an endgame with the space elevator
[2:16:14] <heartlesshealer> conveyor belts is when the layout brain spiders come to live in you forever
[2:16:14] <+HitchhikingThrough> huh, he seems pretty satisfied
[2:16:16] <%Broand> The end state is BIG FACTORY
[2:16:16] <+Partialrecall2> stop all the dowloading
[2:16:22] <triggersqueeze1985> Sandbox
[2:16:23] <+ReallyBigRocks> @Deekman not really besides optimization
[2:16:23] <xbb1024> It's still in early access, the story will be part of the full game
[2:16:32] <%ArcanumArcanum> @Deekman not really any story. there's 8 tiers of tech to work through, but no real victory condition yet. Game is still early access
[2:16:34] <+Deekman> @gryffinp thanks! I need a story with these crafting games lol
[2:16:48] <%holydeviant1> Miner > Smelter > Constructor (for a specific part) > Storage
[2:16:51] <$Dakuu75> oh yeah? is the goal to become space-trump?
[2:16:51] <+silentblast93> just wait till over clocking
[2:16:53] <+superblar> The constructor will turn those ingots into other materials
[2:16:54] <NitronStreams> @HitchhikingThrough you could almost call it... satisfactory
[2:16:56] <gryffinp> oh god fuck screws
[2:17:01] <LorcaNomad> so chat how's pat doing so far
[2:17:06] <%Broand> Screws are the bane of my existence
[2:17:11] <gryffinp> its going well.
[2:17:12] <%Jekado> not to bad
[2:17:16] <%depressed_skeleton> In rod we trust
[2:17:21] <+HitchhikingThrough> good I think?
[2:17:26] <%ArcanumArcanum> Optimizing screw production is suffering
[2:17:28] <%Jekado> @Broand you can get recipies that make the screws more efficent
[2:17:29] <$floralkami> @dakuu75 no, you still are a worker in this equation
[2:17:31] <NoCreditClear> screws be like "fuck all of your perfect ratios"
[2:17:41] <%Broand> yes but still
[2:17:41] <%SomersaultJustice> screw it up
[2:17:45] <@SoFarFetched> Just don't put the screw in the tuna
[2:17:53] <triggersqueeze1985> Screw u
[2:17:55] <%holydeviant1> Perfect efficiency is for CHUMPS
[2:17:57] <%holydeviant1> I SAID IT
[2:17:58] <%Broand> casted screw and steel screw is the ones I go with
[2:17:59] <gryffinp> its hilarious how few screws 100 screws is
[2:18:01] <+Partialrecall2> at chat, any action-based stuff or is this game all chill out?
[2:18:06] <$floralkami> @dakuu75 also capable of success
[2:18:11] <+superblar> The happiest I have ever been was when I optimized screw production, god I hated waiting on screws
[2:18:14] <%holydeviant1> reinforced plates
[2:18:25] <gryffinp> @Partialrecall2 Some, there is alien wildlife that will fuck you up if you step to their turf
[2:18:25] <+ReallyBigRocks> @Partialrecall2 sometimes you have to taze aliens to death but that's about it
[2:18:26] <$Dakuu75> @floralkami lol
[2:18:30] <%darklordfodder> This is mostly a chill game. There's aliens but...they don't add anything to the game.
[2:18:33] <gryffinp> if you stay in your base you're fine though
[2:18:41] <$Dakuu75> OH, wtf was that canned rat-meat from Outer Wilds? when do we make that?
[2:18:49] <bonebagMEL> NONONONONON
[2:18:50] <%Broand> You need a belt
[2:18:50] <%holydeviant1> NEED CONVEYORS
[2:18:50] <boogaleeboo> yep
[2:18:50] <%darklordfodder> No you need belts.
[2:18:51] <%holydeviant1> BUT YES
[2:18:52] <%depressed_skeleton> yep
[2:18:54] <bonebagMEL> you need conveyourbelts
[2:18:54] <%Broand> Between them
[2:18:54] <+patel347> not yet need belts
[2:18:54] <+Rofiarf> need space for conveyer but yes
[2:18:54] <gryffinp> No. You need a conveyor belt between them
[2:18:55] <%ArcanumArcanum> @PatStaresAt hold CTRL while aiming and it can snap the lineup
[2:18:55] <+D00msDayDan> no it would still need belts
[2:18:55] <%hamborgini> you need conveyor belts, but yes
[2:18:55] <+ccwettr123> still need conveyor belts
[2:18:55] <NoCreditClear> you don't  have belts yet, but yes
[2:18:56] <xbb1024> leave some space, use conveyor belt
[2:18:56] <+InvertableQuasar> You need conveyor belts
[2:18:56] <bonebagMEL> to connect them
[2:18:56] <+queaks> need conveyor
[2:18:57] <$HyperionXV> You'll unlock conveyer belts in a few tiers
[2:18:58] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Not yet, need belts
[2:18:58] <+TipsyND> That's pretty much the whole game
[2:18:59] <+ReallyBigRocks> I mean kinda
[2:18:59] <%darklordfodder> Which you unlock...hopefully next?
[2:19:06] <+PersonifiedTFT> you need to belt it together
[2:19:06] <%Broand> Put it in front of the other yeah
[2:19:07] <%depressed_skeleton> Green line = Aligned
[2:19:09] <triggersqueeze1985> Iguana on a stick or uninstall
[2:19:09] <%AzureGale> Be like Nomura, use belts
[2:19:09] <heartlesshealer> kind of
[2:19:14] <%holydeviant1> VoteYea VoteYea
[2:19:14] <%Broand> that works
[2:19:18] <+Shackle_Rustyford> are there storage facitilities like in factorio and dyson sphere that let you create buffers for storage and logistics?
[2:19:20] <heartlesshealer> goblin time
[2:19:26] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Hold left ctrl to align
[2:19:26] <%Jekado> concrete
[2:19:27] <%crimsonharvest> take some miners out to the concrete patch
[2:19:29] <bonebagMEL> Remember you can deconstruct for free
[2:19:29] <%AzureGale> Time 2 fight Concrete Man
[2:19:29] <%holydeviant1> AND THE NEXT STEP BEGINS
[2:19:30] <Tuna_Can_0> nothing snaps to grids NotLikeThis
[2:19:30] <%ArcanumArcanum> no you cant
[2:19:30] <+Rofiarf> there is limestone next to your area
[2:19:33] <%hamborgini> you cannot just
[2:19:33] <gryffinp> @Shackle_Rustyford OH yes.
[2:19:33] <%Jekado> you will need... ALL the concrete
[2:19:35] <+JobbedBone> daisy chain LUL
[2:19:39] <%Jekado> you cannot chain
[2:19:44] <%Jekado> YOU MUST POWER LINE
[2:19:45] <%crimsonharvest> power poles allow multiple connections
[2:19:45] <bonebagMEL> poles have 4 cables
[2:19:46] <Mr_Rakjo> make more generators
[2:19:47] <xbb1024> power poll
[2:19:48] <+storebrandcandy> time to get some sand
[2:19:49] <%ArcanumArcanum> Buildings and generators can do 1. Poles can do 4
[2:19:50] <+HitchhikingThrough> I don't think you have cable on you?
[2:19:50] <+ReallyBigRocks> can't daisy chain. power poles are the only thing that allow multiple cables
[2:19:51] <$HyperionXV> Power poles are the only thing that can have multiple connections
[2:19:51] <%holydeviant1> one cable to one item, power pole can hold like four
[2:19:51] <xbb1024> pole
[2:19:53] <%notsoy> HAHA TIME FOR LIMESTONE
[2:19:58] <heartlesshealer> yeah, this is why you need the poles
[2:19:58] <+HitchhikingThrough> I could be very wrong
[2:20:04] <$Dakuu75> @PatStaresAt When do we start mass producing Sprats and Saltuna
[2:20:06] <%Solarint> Solarint subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months! how is sub baby formed?
[2:20:07] <+Shackle_Rustyford> im sold already tbh how much is this?
[2:20:12] <%notsoy> make a new extractor
[2:20:12] <%holydeviant1> oh god this is making me want to start my save over
[2:20:20] <%Broand> grab a miner and get overther
[2:20:27] <+Shackle_Rustyford> i can never keep a save long enough in these games
[2:20:28] <gryffinp> @HitchhikingThrough you're right that he doesn't have cable on him, but he's ALSO right that he's going to need concrete to do the thing he wants to do
[2:20:31] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Ctrl click in inventory moves all of that type over into box or whatever. Good when you have 600 iron ore.
[2:20:34] <heartlesshealer> I love when you get to the solar panel stage though. Fucking love setting up energy stations
[2:20:41] <%holydeviant1> @PatStaresAt do you have a mining building? Not an autominer. A BUILDING?
[2:20:43] <+Shackle_Rustyford> each time i learn a new way to optimize i end up just restarting because i cant be assed to delete and rebuild to the new discovery
[2:20:45] <+HitchhikingThrough> @gryffinp cool cool
[2:20:58] <gryffinp> @holydeviant1 Nope, he's not there yet
[2:21:01] <%ArcanumArcanum> @holydeviant1 i dont think he has those yet
[2:21:02] <%Broand> not yet holy
[2:21:09] <%holydeviant1> Dang
[2:21:12] <%holydeviant1> So close
[2:21:15] <%SWFanatic> Umbasa

[2:21:50] <SpaceManHotepIV> myeees
[2:21:50] <heartlesshealer> oh wait, I might be thinking of mod. I forget what's in base game at the moment
[2:21:52] <%DiscoMatador> Yes YES
[2:21:52] <xbb1024> grassfields are good for impure nodes
[2:21:53] <%holydeviant1> Oh man pat, wait until you don;t even need to check them
[2:21:54] <%Solarint> COOMING
[2:21:54] <%TheWinged7> DREEEEELLL

[2:21:59] <%jarednotwithsubway> very satisfying indeed
[2:21:59] <+archangel9889> @PatStaresAt Are you ok???
[2:21:59] <NoCreditClear> Pat is BIG HAPPY
[2:22:00] <heartlesshealer> enjoy pat <3

[2:22:09] <%ssjklyco> Looks like a miner issue
[2:22:12] <$Dakuu75> Pat is gonna monopolize the fuck outa this bio-economy. lol @PatStaresAt
[2:22:13] <+meprocrastinate> I can SEE the neurons firing in his brain
[2:22:14] <%holydeviant1> Big happy pat, I love it
[2:22:14] <+NecDW4> P A T N U T

[2:22:17] <Veluren> Give it time and you can~
[2:22:17] <%notsoy> now imagine what happens when you make more miners
[2:22:18] <%blastyoboots> I love it SO much
[2:22:20] <%Nested_Dreams> Now to see his reaction to the BS belts can do
[2:22:21] <%Cybercobra2> you can with that concrete

[2:22:29] <%SWFanatic> become huge
[2:22:30] <+ReallyBigRocks> Miner Mk.1 is where the real Factory Souls starts
[2:22:31] <%CommanderSqueaks> So how long until Pat has a massive conveyor belt from his miners to his facility?
[2:22:31] <+SkookumHime> how's the new camera settings??
[2:22:31] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Pats dying ........... OF FUN
[2:22:33] <%jarednotwithsubway> leave this planet an empty husk
[2:22:35] <%barrakuta371> Is Pat feeling that this is Satisfactory?
[2:22:36] <+archangel9889> never seen a guy almost cum playing this game.
[2:22:38] <+HitchhikingThrough> ah, there's the drug addiction I was expectingh
[2:22:38] <jorniev> are there like drones or something that auto picks up the resouces from the drills?
[2:22:38] <+JobbedBone> BibleThump slash and burn

[2:22:49] <%holydeviant1> Pat become TYRANID
[2:22:51] <%darklordfodder> Does this game have the equivalent of construction/logistic bots(yet)?
[2:22:54] <ammobasket> Cut trees?
[2:22:54] <LorcaNomad> DESTROY THE LAND PAT DO IT
[2:22:54] <triggersqueeze1985> It’s growing
[2:23:01] <blink289> you should get paige in this game so you can see that wacky multiplayer shit that can happen
[2:23:02] <gryffinp> many memories of doing exactly that, scrambling around grabbing leaf
[2:23:02] <%Dunmarkh> next step, cracktorio
[2:23:12] <%crimsonharvest> pat make another smelter to do copper
[2:23:22] <jorniev> WHEN PAT SEES A PERCFECT WORLD... HE SEES THE MOON
[2:23:22] <+MooseIsGoose> Can you only load 100 at a time
[2:23:22] <%Cybercobra2> YEYEYE
[2:23:28] <+HitchhikingThrough> See I was kind of expecting this to happen with subnautica
[2:23:30] <+ReallyBigRocks> @darklordfodder you can set up automated shipping lanes but not building construction
[2:23:33] <LVL1_Scumbag> Pat can't play factorio, resources are finite
[2:23:34] <DannyMcgee> So how's the Onceler game going?
[2:23:37] <%jarednotwithsubway> LET IT FLOW THROUGH YOU
[2:23:37] <+HitchhikingThrough> but satisfactory makes more sense
[2:23:38] <PinoProxie> get that pole
[2:23:38] <%Deadpal> oh shit
[2:23:40] <%DiscoMatador> Pole is a MUST
[2:23:41] <sonofthedeepsouth> ENDORPHINS GOES WOOSH
[2:23:42] <%notsoy> HE'S BEGINNING TO BELIEVE
[2:23:44] <%caramelatte1> Is this pornographic content now?
[2:23:44] <%Deadpal> just tuned in, how goes satisfactory?
[2:23:50] <%Solarint> I was gonna ask if Pat was enjoying this, but I think I got my answer from that reaction to the limestone
[2:23:54] <zedravan> the happy place
[2:23:54] <%Broand> There's the flying thing
[2:23:55] <boogaleeboo> Like the only thing that can break flow is the occasional mob
[2:23:55] <%holydeviant1> At this point, you want like four smelters to feed all the manufacturers
[2:23:56] <%DiscoMatador> THE FACTORY MUST GROW
[2:23:57] <%toolofparanoia> Deforestation made FUN!
[2:23:59] <TurtlesAndTentacles> THE SKY!'
[2:24:00] <%Puhff> idk why but the panic makes it funnier
[2:24:00] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Try out N key.
[2:24:02] <CrematedCube> Very Satisfactory
[2:24:02] <%king_wragles> I bet if you caught that bird you could use it in the biomass furnace
[2:24:03] <%MrGuy516> I think pat like creative games now.
[2:24:04] <%jarednotwithsubway> feels good
[2:24:04] <%DianaTheAscian> you having fun?
[2:24:05] <LorcaNomad> pat how do you like the game so far
[2:24:07] <%darklordfodder> @LVL1_Scumbag He could play modded factorio where they aren't haha.

[2:24:26] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Also a calculator.
[2:24:27] <%toolofparanoia> He's really feeling it
[2:24:30] <%Broand> dude can't find his butt

[2:25:53] <LVL1_Scumbag> Your require more vespene gas
[2:25:54] <%toolofparanoia> Poo gas

[2:29:44] <xbb1024> you will need lots of concrete
[2:29:46] <NoCreditClear> "one concrete" LUL
[2:29:52] <NitronStreams> Power Pole EXTEND!
[2:30:08] <zamzoph> jam it Kreygasm
[2:30:10] <$Dakuu75> @NitronStreams YES
[2:30:10] <CappuccinoGuil> back, what did I miss?
[2:30:11] <%Jekado> wires go really far
[2:30:15] <+silentblast93> lime stone just makes concret  so just make a full stack
[2:30:16] <%Jekado> so you don't have to have them super close
[2:30:19] <+HitchhikingThrough> need cable
[2:30:20] <xbb1024> dismantle your current cable
[2:30:20] <%Broand> Cale
[2:30:21] <%holydeviant1> DECONSTRUCT THE SMELTER
[2:30:21] <%CommanderSqueaks> Need cable.
[2:30:24] <%depressed_skeleton> it can have 4 connections
[2:30:24] <%Dunmarkh> you need cables
[2:30:25] <CappuccinoGuil> Generator can only have 1 line
[2:30:26] <+JobbedBone> connections
[2:30:26] <%Jekado> you need cables
[2:30:28] <+ReallyBigRocks> you can do 4 wires to the pole
[2:30:28] <%BinaryFireball> gotta charge that shiiiiiiit
[2:30:28] <%Cybercobra2> you can only hook 4 wires to one powerpole
[2:30:28] <%hamborgini> up to 4 connections per pole
[2:30:29] <gryffinp> Power poles can have four connections
[2:30:29] <%holydeviant1> then rebuild and wire it up correctly
[2:30:31] <%Jekado> thats how many connections
[2:30:32] <Griffin1171> number of possible connections
[2:30:34] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> spoke and hub. Put cable into pole then out to  the machine
[2:30:34] <+D00msDayDan> connect power source to pole, pole to other things
[2:30:36] <%notsoy> scavenge your old cable and put it to the tower instead
[2:30:40] <%depressed_skeleton> 1 to a generator / previous pole & 3 connections
[2:30:41] <%Ebonyglow> Ebonyglow subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 24 months! Conglaturations on getting hitched!
[2:30:50] <+silentblast93> you have to connect it to a power supplu
[2:30:56] <%Jekado> F
[2:31:00] <+Deekman> F
[2:31:05] <%holydeviant1> oh, i didn't know you could do that
[2:31:05] <Griffin1171> put one power pole right next to your generator
[2:31:15] <%holydeviant1> Always leave one slot on every pole
[2:31:19] <%holydeviant1> ALWAYS
[2:31:20] <CappuccinoGuil> HE LEARNS
[2:31:22] <%jarednotwithsubway> YES
[2:31:24] <%depressed_skeleton> i n du s t r y
[2:31:28] <Griffin1171> always leave one connection open for another pole
[2:31:29] <%CommanderSqueaks> So you can string poles to poles?
[2:31:29] <NitronStreams> ITS WORKING! ITS WORKING!
[2:31:33] <$Dakuu75> everything is comming up millhouse
[2:31:33] <%notsoy> BIGGEST BRAINED ORB

[2:31:35] <%Jekado> for expansion
[2:31:37] <NeroInfinite> no it's an expansion thing
[2:31:37] <+ReallyBigRocks> extra slot for make more pole
[2:31:37] <NoCreditClear> for EXPANSION later
[2:31:38] <CappuccinoGuil> It's so you can make more poles if you need
[2:31:39] <EvanDude47> so you can add another line alter
[2:31:39] <Mr_Rakjo> P R O G R E S S
[2:31:39] <%DiscoMatador> To connect to next pole
[2:31:39] <%AzureGale> growling doog
[2:31:40] <%holydeviant1> No, it's so you can keep connecting them
[2:31:41] <+ccwettr123> remember you turned the power off
[2:31:43] <boogaleeboo> MAKE THE POLES TOUCH
[2:31:43] <LVL1_Scumbag> Dopamine attained
[2:31:44] <iosephe> makes it easy to connect new poles
[2:31:44] <%hamborgini> it's so you can daisy chain poles, so yes
[2:31:48] <NeroInfinite> yes
[2:31:50] <%maybefalco> daisy chain poles
[2:31:51] <$realm_forge> This is literally the fallout 4 base building system
[2:31:52] <%Jekado> yes
[2:31:57] <+InvertableQuasar> Generator is off
[2:31:59] <gryffinp> gotta go turn the generator back on
[2:32:00] <%SWFanatic> Giefy Growl
[2:32:00] <+silentblast93> no its cause other polls will take a slot
[2:32:08] <%holydeviant1> THE FACTORY LIVES

[2:35:00] <Darthkitten_Prime> "I need more inventory" is ALWAYS the case with these games.
[2:35:02] <+HitchhikingThrough> @Dakuu75 man minecraft mods really created a whole separate genre of videogame huh
[2:35:02] <%notsoy> now you just have to turn that workstation around so it's properly connected to the hub
[2:35:06] <%crimsonharvest> Have your goal be to not need to carry raw resources in your pockets
[2:35:10] <%Jekado> both yours and mass storage become a thing
[2:35:12] <suspiciousmoose> @fisterofgods seriously?
[2:35:14] <CappuccinoGuil> CONVEYORS, LET'S GO
[2:35:14] <%Jekado> your inventory gets really large
[2:35:15] <+silentblast93> uh pat beep that baton in your hand

[2:35:30] <%Jekado> its fine
[2:35:35] <%Nested_Dreams> Workstation is fine
[2:35:37] <%notsoy> the workshop is technically inside out lol
[2:35:39] <+SocialMisfitGamer> The work station is backwards
[2:35:43] <xbb1024> This is your first setup, don't worry about it
[2:35:44] <%notsoy> but it's not a big deal
[2:35:48] <boogaleeboo> Yeah it's just aesthetics

[2:36:14] <%notsoy> yeah, you instantly get all the parts back
[2:36:14] <LorcaNomad> that's big
[2:36:14] <boogaleeboo> You lose nothing for breaking things up
[2:36:14] <$HyperionXV> Yeah there's no recycle fee
[2:36:15] <%Cybercobra2> you always get everything back
[2:36:17] <%Broand> For everything you dismantle too
[2:36:22] <%jarednotwithsubway> that is a very good to do
[2:36:25] <+Shackle_Rustyford> the neurosis begins
[2:36:26] <CappuccinoGuil> EFFICIENCY, my guy
[2:36:27] <+ReallyBigRocks> You get platforms eventually to make giant featureless planes so you'll probably end up dismantling everything eventually anyway
[2:36:28] <%notsoy> you can reconfigure really fast like this
[2:36:30] <%SWFanatic> psaBig psaGoblin
[2:36:31] <%CommanderSqueaks> goblins go brrrrrr
[2:36:34] <boogaleeboo> The game is very not punishing
[2:36:40] <NoCreditClear> you can do BIG MESSY and just clean it up later. don't stress
[2:36:43] <NeroInfinite> yes
[2:36:44] <%GarbageNirvana> And here comes the OCD
[2:36:45] <xbb1024> ground isn't level, you can't there

[2:36:50] <+Partialrecall2> plot twist fisterofgods is liam
[2:37:07] <+HitchhikingThrough> @fisterofgods not frequently.
[2:37:10] <+silentblast93> the buildings dont connest satisfyingly
[2:37:15] <+BusterRepukken> its alot easier with level ground
[2:37:15] <%DorianCreed> Next week on Pat Stares At: Pat shows us around his perfectly automated endgane Satisfactory world
[2:37:19] <Griffin1171> you'll get the ability to make floors later

[2:37:46] <%holydeviant1> @DorianCreed "So with H-shaped lines, I can get much more efficiency with my screws..."
[2:37:47] <CappuccinoGuil> I'd recommend putting the workshop on the OTHER side of the HUB
[2:37:49] <gryffinp> @DorianCreed thirty turbo motors per minute baybeee
[2:37:50] <%SWFanatic> attache case grinding offstream
[2:37:52] <boogaleeboo> belts are the next thing he gets

[2:40:22] <rufus2k2> this is the mindgoblin healing game
[2:40:22] <%CommanderSqueaks> Is Pat going to start talking dirty to the conveyor belts?
[2:40:23] <+silentblast93> now you need a auto minor
[2:40:23] <+Solutha> now cover this entire planet with conveyor belts
[2:40:24] <%SWFanatic> are ya winnin?
[2:40:26] <%Figleafplays> THE INGOTS

[2:40:32] <BwdYeti> FEED THE BEAST
[2:40:34] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Now look at how many ingots it makes in a minute and how many it needs in a minute
[2:40:35] <$Trenr> well, go set a goal then
[2:40:35] <+superblar> Kreygasm Kreygasm
[2:40:35] <xbb1024> you need storage
[2:40:36] <%holydeviant1> pne for rods, one for screws...
[2:40:36] <LorcaNomad> as you do with games like these
[2:40:41] <%crimsonharvest> you arent
[2:40:42] <%holydeviant1> YOU DON'T,
[2:40:43] <zazzera01> milestones bruh
[2:40:43] <CappuccinoGuil> You won't, yet
[2:40:44] <$Trenr> you have milestones
[2:40:45] <%crimsonharvest> biomass is hand fed only
[2:40:45] <DannyMcgee> So at some point does this just turn to cookie clicker? If so that rules.
[2:40:45] <%holydeviant1> HA HA
[2:40:45] <+InvertableQuasar> You cannot
[2:40:46] <+HitchhikingThrough> Miner->smelter->crafter->storage
[2:40:46] <+ReallyBigRocks> You don't
[2:40:47] <%Broand> You cant
[2:40:47] <gryffinp> you don't, hahaha
[2:40:48] <%hamborgini> you get storage buildings soon if you don't have them already
[2:40:48] <+SocialMisfitGamer> you dont
[2:40:49] <CappuccinoGuil> Not this one
[2:40:49] <chaosbringer28> you dont
[2:40:50] <%Jekado> you can't
[2:40:51] <T_Sasquatch> pat is going to crash so hard soon, im calling it
[2:40:51] <%CommanderSqueaks> Not yet
[2:40:51] <%Bentusi1634> You cannot. First fully automated power is coal.
[2:40:52] <NeroInfinite> now make more
[2:40:52] <+silentblast93> you wont
[2:40:54] <Griffin1171> you cant
[2:40:55] <%DorianCreed> You don't
[2:40:57] <%Broand> This is the curse of early game power
[2:40:57] <+ccwettr123> biomass is manual only, you get new power later
[2:40:59] <%mield916> hub upgrades give you more inventory
[2:41:01] <+HitchhikingThrough> Rewords
[2:41:06] <+HitchhikingThrough> *rewards
[2:41:07] <%holydeviant1> AND THERE IT IS
[2:41:08] <CappuccinoGuil> oh it's happening now
[2:41:12] <%Nested_Dreams> Biomass can't be automated, gotta figure out other power sources
[2:41:13] <+wmeldrum> automated minor
[2:41:13] <Griffin1171> THAT'S THE TICKET
[2:41:14] <NeroInfinite> YOu can't.
[2:41:15] <+ReallyBigRocks> Miner Mk1 is the real Factory Souls
[2:41:16] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat stop getting aroused over the mining equipment.
[2:41:17] <%blastyoboots> IT'S HAPPENING
[2:41:18] <CappuccinoGuil> You've never seen something SEXIER
[2:41:19] <%holydeviant1> Everything you need for a fully automated supply line
[2:41:22] <bigshedman> Connect a miner to the smelter and connect the crafter to a storage-unit or the rocketship-thingy
[2:41:23] <boogaleeboo> That miner can output to a smelter, that outputs to a constructor, that outputs to a container
[2:41:26] <$payatanharkonnen> Build more build larger
[2:41:27] <%JumboCrunchies> I cant wait for Pat to get really into this off stream, then show up next week and have the entire world covered in a giant twisting network of conveyor belts and machines, while he sits up high on his giant throne
[2:41:28] <xbb1024> no, you will have power issues
[2:41:29] <gryffinp> Storage containers are The Way and The Truth.
[2:41:30] <%UvBenServed> Pat talkin about hot miners?
[2:41:31] <+Shackle_Rustyford> NO
[2:41:33] <+Shackle_Rustyford> DONT START

[2:42:30] <%AncelDeLambert> will the update include offline mode?
[2:42:32] <%vivaldiva> full LP incoming
[2:42:32] <+ExclusivelyPlastic> Huge update shouldn't change much early game stuff anyway
[2:42:33] <%CommanderSqueaks> Stream Schedule cancelled, all games replaced with Satisfactory.
[2:42:33] <$Dakuu75> @PatStaresAt did you have too much coffee?
[2:42:33] <+ReallyBigRocks> It's a very manic game
[2:42:33] <%king_wragles> So this is Pat's new heroin, and it self replicates into more heroin
[2:42:34] <NitronStreams> change the name of this game to "Goblin Feeder 2021"
[2:42:35] <%MelBrooksKA> Paige: sipsipGears sipsipGears sipsipGears
[2:42:36] <%crimsonharvest> @PatStaresAt try out Dyson Sphere Program too if you feel interested, it's really strong
[2:42:36] <gryffinp> Honestly the update should be all lategame stuff so by the time the update drops he will be ready for it
[2:42:39] <%holydeviant1> for high up conveyers
[2:42:39] <xbb1024> for longer belts
[2:42:39] <T_Sasquatch> pat stop you're actually making me want to play
[2:42:40] <%AncelDeLambert> @PatStaresAt play Factorio, nerd
[2:42:42] <%JumboCrunchies> Holds up Conveyor belts
[2:42:43] <%Cybercobra2> for elevated convayor belts
[2:42:44] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat, look at the Codex
[2:42:44] <+HitchhikingThrough> limit to how far a belt can go I think
[2:42:45] <iosephe> it's what the belts go on
[2:42:46] <$Trenr> it's a pole. for conveyors
[2:42:46] <NeroInfinite> It rubs pat's brain good.
[2:42:47] <%Broand> you can put belts onto poles
[2:42:48] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> VERTICALITY to belts
[2:42:48] <%holydeviant1> positioning for belts
[2:42:51] <LorcaNomad> is this going to be a mainstay in pat's videogame repertoire
[2:42:51] <%Jekado> its for supporting the conveyer
[2:42:52] <%jarednotwithsubway> a pole for your conveyor
[2:42:54] <%DakotaMacDoodle> he's gone now there is no pat only efficacy
[2:42:55] <%Jekado> you don't need to worry about it
[2:42:56] <%MrGuy516> I think pat is just gonna play it everyday through the 16th as well.
[2:42:56] <%hamborgini> you can use it to make conveyor belts go up slopes and shit
[2:42:56] <heartlesshealer> Height
[2:42:57] <CrematedCube> It is a wonderful game for frantically scrambling around
[2:42:58] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> For tall belts.
[2:43:04] <NeroInfinite> It's a pole to raise belts
[2:43:08] <%Jekado> the conveyer belt will auto place them
[2:43:09] <+ReallyBigRocks> for long and tall belts
[2:43:11] <PinoProxie> Ok
[2:43:11] <DrkJP520> He's coked up on numbers
[2:43:11] <%JumboCrunchies> Long or Tall
[2:43:14] <%darklordfodder> THE FACTORY MUST GROW
[2:43:14] <%jarednotwithsubway> long and tall
[2:43:14] <DraxTD> man look how fast Pat is talking.. he's TWEEEEKING
[2:43:15] <T_Sasquatch> ok but really whats your goal in this game ?
[2:43:16] <%AzureGale> OKokokokokokokokokokokok
[2:43:17] <bigshedman> Belts have a limit for length so they need supports
[2:43:22] <NitronStreams> Recipe
[2:43:24] <+D00msDayDan> for placing belts manually instead of just connection to connection
[2:43:30] <heartlesshealer> it's also for making conveyor belt highways for intersection stuff
[2:43:30] <%BinaryFireball> make conveyor belt circle  and ride it around
[2:43:34] <%holydeviant1> hahahahah
[2:43:35] <triggersqueeze1985> Just say no
[2:43:38] <%jarednotwithsubway> hehehe
[2:43:40] <%holydeviant1> every discovery is so high energy
[2:43:41] <T_Sasquatch> surely you can't just be optimizing production for the sake of production
[2:43:41] <+ReallyBigRocks> You can auto craft EVERYTHING
[2:43:42] <DraxTD> ASSASSIN!
[2:43:42] <zamzoph> my favorite x-man
[2:43:46] <%XeroSigmaPrime> CABLE
[2:43:47] <%AzureGale> Don't make Cable, that means you have to be friendly to Cyclops
[2:43:47] <%Cybercobra2> they can make EVERYTHING you can as long as it takes a single resource to do so
[2:43:48] <+JobbedBone> @T_Sasquatch seek endorphins to transcend the grind
[2:43:49] <Griffin1171> wire
[2:43:49] <+HitchhikingThrough> oh pat's doomed
[2:43:50] <$realm_forge> Pats brain drugs are kicking in
[2:43:51] <gryffinp> @T_Sasquatch ???
[2:43:52] <Griffin1171> not cable
[2:43:54] <Madovir> he sounds the same kind of manic high he did when he opened all those lootboxes
[2:43:55] <%cvp5127> FOR THE FUTURE
[2:43:57] <NoCreditClear> placing conveyor poles is less necessary now that you can adjust height on them while stringing belts. that was a good update
[2:44:01] <%Nekros4442> FOR THE FUTURE
[2:44:02] <fiercefiresoul> Proof that the human mind was designed to enslave itself to addiction: this stream.
[2:44:04] <%Broand> If you can make another constructor, you can feed wire from one to make cable in another
[2:44:05] <%maybefalco> pat cables are an extra step
[2:44:07] <%CommanderSqueaks> @T_Sasquatch If you're not into what's going on right now, this is probably not your type of game. Automation go up, serotonin go BRR.
[2:44:08] <$Sdeje> Grab leaves!
[2:44:08] <bigshedman> I can't wait till Pat makes belts that connect two different resources into a single smelter. That shit is so satisfying.
[2:44:08] <%jarednotwithsubway> SATE the GOBLINS Pat!!
[2:44:09] <+InvertableQuasar> @t_sasquatch, Right now he has goals in the top right he's working towards
[2:44:09] <%crimsonharvest> pat did you see that the blue light comes from a blue star
[2:44:09] <%SWFanatic> Zangief snoring sounds like a dragon
[2:44:10] <hardin360> Can't go directly to cable from ingots.
[2:44:12] <DraxTD> THE FU-CHA
[2:44:13] <+HitchhikingThrough> Schedule update: Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Satis
[2:44:14] <+Walopoh> @DraxTD he'll be making squirrel noises in a few hours if this continues
[2:44:17] <%DorianCreed> @PatStaresAt It only does one step of construction, so Copper -> Wires, but not Copper -> Cable
[2:44:20] <%DianaTheAscian> This game seems like drugs for Pat
[2:44:20] <%Spydurman> Pat is getting high right now
[2:44:22] <%crimsonharvest> oh they changed the color? it used to be blue
[2:44:25] <%wibbwobbler> game is looking pretty lit so far
[2:44:25] <Griffin1171> you need to switch it to make wires intead
[2:44:25] <%Master_Van> Master_Van subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 22 months! 
[2:44:29] <LorcaNomad> this is even better than the time he started playing animal crossing
[2:44:33] <+silentblast93> @PatStaresAt learn how to daisy chain in this game it is super efficant
[2:44:33] <%Spydurman> this is stronger than cocaine for the ginger
[2:44:33] <+D00msDayDan> @PatStaresAt you can slidehop
[2:44:37] <%depressed_skeleton> Eat it
[2:44:41] <%CommanderSqueaks> My goal would be finding out how to traverse the fart gas.
[2:44:42] <%notsoy> you would need a second constructor to fully automate the cable-making process
[2:44:45] <+Shackle_Rustyford> he'll figure that out shortly
[2:44:46] <+PersonifiedTFT> Pat is this what its like to try heroin for the first time? @PatStaresAt
[2:44:48] <+ReallyBigRocks> @PatStaresAt Learn the slide jump
[2:44:48] <%toolofparanoia> SKY FLAP FLAP
[2:44:49] <%Broand> Yes
[2:44:51] <$Dakuu75> Manta in the sky? Equip StormBringer
[2:44:54] <+HitchhikingThrough> IS THAT FUCKING WARFRAME CONTROLS
[2:44:55] <gryffinp> yes, really, warframe jumps
[2:44:57] <%CommanderSqueaks> Why does this game have such solid movement tech?
[2:44:57] <triggersqueeze1985> Is gief the equivalent to a sloth bear at this point
[2:44:58] <T_Sasquatch> @InvertableQuasar ok that makes sense ! im into the game but i was just wondering
[2:45:02] <+mcburgers3000> You're going to need another smelter to make copper so you can be twice as efficient
[2:45:02] <DraxTD> @Walopoh I sware, it's like he likes to Mine and Craft with that materials
[2:45:04] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> are there tunnels/mines in this game or is it all above ground
[2:45:05] <%kullumanati> Definitely more fun then Banjo. Ekkem Bocome. WutFace
[2:45:05] <%mield916> *just wait until the robo legs
[2:45:11] <heartlesshealer> @HitchhikingThrough ; )
[2:45:11] <%Nested_Dreams> Will Pat figure out he can chain Constructors?
[2:45:12] <+JustToWatch> gotta figure out the schmovement
[2:45:12] <+SocialMisfitGamer> wire first than cable
[2:45:13] <$Dakuu75> LMAO
[2:45:13] <+TheMorilo> LUL
[2:45:14] <NitronStreams> wire not cable
[2:45:15] <%SilvaChariot0133> LUL
[2:45:16] <%Cybercobra2> you need TWO constructors
[2:45:17] <sendart> build another constructer!
[2:45:18] <%blastyoboots> XD
[2:45:21] <+RealMichaelPhelps> OH FUCK
[2:45:23] <%notsoy> you have to make it make wire
[2:45:24] <boogaleeboo> You could make another constructor
[2:45:25] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat, now make another one to turn the wire into Cable
[2:45:26] <%Aeoneth> The Mindgoblins have started to arrive
[2:45:26] <+Shackle_Rustyford> why are there such good movement controls lmao
[2:45:27] <+HitchhikingThrough> Now make another crafter to make the cable
[2:45:28] <rufus2k2> SOMEBODY CALL THE FOREMAN
[2:45:29] <+JobbedBone> LIVE DEMOS BibleThump
[2:45:29] <%Jekado> @CommanderSqueaks some parts of moving on belts is wonky
[2:45:30] <%vivaldiva> "wooooooooow..."
[2:45:30] <T_Sasquatch> Minecraft is much less involved than this at its entry level
[2:45:30] <rufus2k2> YO JIMMY
[2:45:31] <+D00msDayDan> OH FUCK GIRLS ARE WATCHING
[2:45:32] <NeroInfinite> Ooh no lul
[2:45:34] <DraxTD> Get Deadpool to get us Cable
[2:45:34] <bigshedman> Daisychain constructors Pat.
[2:45:35] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> route wire into another one for cable?
[2:45:35] <gryffinp> honestly they really need to add in this game is walljumps and then the movement in this game will be ace
[2:45:36] <Griffin1171> just addanother constructor
[2:45:37] <+silentblast93> make a nothor constructor pat
[2:45:38] <%UvBenServed> My favorite element
[2:45:38] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat, make another crafter to make cable.
[2:45:42] <+JobbedBone> BibleThump LIVE DEMOS ALWAYS GO WRONG BibleThump
[2:45:49] <NoCreditClear> @JobbedBone They openly said "we copied Titanfall"
[2:45:49] <Griffin1171> chain another constructor
[2:45:50] <%DiscoMatador> Need another to make da cable
[2:45:54] <heartlesshealer> make oxium
[2:45:57] <triggersqueeze1985> Hard.....wire
[2:45:58] <DraxTD> @D00msDayDan it's fine, it's his soon wife he trapped into marrage
[2:46:01] <%toolofparanoia> INCREASE PRODUCTION OUTPUT
[2:46:04] <%CommanderSqueaks> @NoCreditClear I mean Titanfall 3 is never happening so why not?
[2:46:09] <%darklordfodder> I've been playing Minecraft Sky Factory 4. Hits a lot of the same parts of the brain.
[2:46:10] <%Jekado> pat you should really automate plates and poles first so you can build more smelters and contructors first
[2:46:10] <%CommanderSqueaks> More crafters Pat, mooooar
[2:46:13] <%blastyoboots> that's what she said
[2:46:18] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Make more smelters and constructors.
[2:46:22] <%toolofparanoia> LET THE FORGES BURN HOT WITH INDUSTY
[2:46:26] <+RealMichaelPhelps> you must construct additional pylons
[2:46:27] <+HitchhikingThrough> oh boy I think I'm just watching this for the day huh
[2:46:30] <+ReallyBigRocks> Time for more machine
[2:46:31] <$ZeOrbling> hey chat, does this game have triggered events like the exploding ship in Subnautica?
[2:46:33] <%Solarint> does this game have the depressing environmental destruction and pollution like factorio?
[2:46:33] <sendart> build additional pylons
[2:46:35] <NeroInfinite> build more industry pat
[2:46:36] <Giztech> MAKE MORE PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[2:46:37] <%A_Mighty_Walrus> can you make a big robot
[2:46:39] <+ReallyBigRocks> gotta make more stuff
[2:46:46] <+Partialrecall2> The Soon Wife sounds like a horror movie title
[2:46:46] <gryffinp> honestly my recommendation is to finish tier 0 and get the very first tier 1, and THEN commence the factory
[2:46:51] <DraxTD> I can't tell if that's Gief or the machines 0.0
[2:46:56] <triggersqueeze1985> Does the time of day change it’s been night forever
[2:46:57] <%CommanderSqueaks> @ZeOrbling It has "Seasonal Events", whatever the hell those are?
[2:46:57] <+JobbedBone> can you make a disassembler to make a neverending loop of materials?
[2:47:13] <%SWFanatic> psaBig psaDogchamp  Zzzzzzz
[2:47:15] <$realm_forge> Do this is how they make amibos huh.....
[2:47:17] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Middle click with build tool to eyedrop.
[2:47:20] <%holydeviant1> @JobbedBone Naw
[2:47:21] <$ZeOrbling> thanks for the info, that sounds interesting
[2:47:27] <%Broand> Put smelter near i-ron and point it awat from it
[2:47:30] <%toolofparanoia> Is this made by the guys that did Subnautica?
[2:47:32] <%BigDumBeak> more rod bigdum1Subyeen
[2:47:32] <bigshedman> @JobbedBone You mean connect a constructor to a dissasembler?
[2:47:40] <gryffinp> The seasonal event is a goofy christmas thing that they still haven't turned off
[2:47:44] <CappuccinoGuil> Pat, if you disassemble a structure with items in it, you get ALL the items in it
[2:47:46] <Joakim_Stormchaser> "I need more rod." Thats what she said.
[2:47:51] <%CommanderSqueaks> EFFICIENCY GO UP, BRAIN GO BRRRRR
[2:47:51] <gryffinp> @toolofparanoia No, but it IS by the guys who made Goat Simulator.
[2:47:52] <NeroInfinite> Multi smelter drifto
[2:47:55] <%toolofparanoia> Interface seems similar
[2:47:57] <%TheWinged7> good luck splitting the output later though
[2:47:58] <NoCreditClear> It used to be way more jank. They improved the ability to make compact factories if desired
[2:48:00] <triggersqueeze1985> It’s March
[2:48:03] <Tytangamer> @patstaresat I'm pretty sure the bit update is only for the experimental build, not the stable.
[2:48:06] <%CommanderSqueaks> Oh god, I might love this game.
[2:48:07] <+Walopoh> the addiction is taking root jermaGrin
[2:48:09] <%holydeviant1> Unwise to facefuck your buildings, makes it hard to expand
[2:48:09] <xbb1024> it gets tricky when you try to do really short distances
[2:48:10] <+c4kie> Wait until he unlocks platforms, the craving for concrete is gonna be hard on Pat
[2:48:15] <+TheBobulus> oh, man, I love this game.  it's so chill.
[2:48:17] <ChungusQuest> Is this No Man's Factorio?
[2:48:19] <%DiscoMatador> Might need another pole i think too
[2:48:20] <+SocialMisfitGamer> I just saw the Iron ore shine, it might mean something
[2:48:21] <+HitchhikingThrough> you made it all into plates
[2:48:21] <boogaleeboo> in the storage
[2:48:23] <%CommanderSqueaks> I am getting second hand serotonin highs from Pat.
[2:48:24] <CappuccinoGuil> You've got ore in the chest
[2:48:26] <%toolofparanoia> @gryffinp lol really? Nice
[2:48:30] <CappuccinoGuil> Chest, Pat
[2:48:30] <%notsoy> STORAGE
[2:48:35] <%Broand> It's just the iron's effect
[2:48:45] <Psyramics> dont you have miners for that? why are you digging it yourself?
[2:48:50] <+JobbedBone> @bigshedman and then the disassembler to a central storage that feeds back into the constructor, yes, if thats a thing
[2:48:51] <$payatanharkonnen> CHEst!
[2:48:54] <+c4kie> HAHAHA - "Oh"
[2:48:57] <Griffin1171> SMELT
[2:48:57] <%CommanderSqueaks> Oh you can make To-Do Lists!?
[2:48:58] <Tuna_Can_0> @ChungusQuest yes but with less trains and infinite resources
[2:48:58] <$Dakuu75> could you really mine iron with your hands and a shitty little screw-driver sized chisel?
[2:49:01] <%Jekado> still weird how i get more enjoyment from these small early access indie games then big AAA dev games.
[2:49:02] <%CommanderSqueaks> Yo
[2:49:11] <$payatanharkonnen> No
[2:49:12] <%AimlessStranger> so what is the major goal of this game?
[2:49:15] <BlueLunecy> B for blashlight
[2:49:19] <CappuccinoGuil> B for Blashlight
[2:49:20] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> B for Bright
[2:49:22] <triggersqueeze1985> Amazing iron chest ahead”
[2:49:22] <+Suchawus> Please put a floor in when you can
[2:49:24] <%depressed_skeleton> One who smeltered it, deltered it
[2:49:28] <%SirGO0SE> smelter delter
[2:49:33] <+silentblast93> @PatStaresAt hey uh pat why dont you orentate the smelter in the direction of the coppor or so when you get the auto miner you can link it to the smelter?
[2:49:33] <%hamborgini> now you just need the delter
[2:49:34] <%jarednotwithsubway> smelt er? i hardly know her!\
[2:49:37] <%CommanderSqueaks> Middle click for eyedropper, apparently.
[2:49:37] <+robosqueeb> But who was dealter!?
[2:49:37] <+Shackle_Rustyford> smelter? i hardly know her!
[2:49:40] <%Broand> who ever smelter delter as they say
[2:49:40] <+TheBobulus> pat, hold ctrl to line buildings up
[2:49:42] <penitentpendant> He's the Smelter, She's the Delter
[2:49:42] <%takotoots> smelt des factories lol
[2:49:43] <%Dunmarkh> *delted*
[2:49:46] <bigshedman> @JobbedBone You could just connect a miner to a constructor and that to a dissasembler and just connect anything you want after that, but it sounds kinda pointless lol.
[2:49:51] <%toolofparanoia> What do sky flap flaps do? They just vibin'?
[2:49:59] <triggersqueeze1985> I can Smelter from here
[2:50:00] <%jarednotwithsubway> ze coppor
[2:50:07] <%AzureGale> lollololololloololol
[2:50:07] <NeroInfinite> They just vibin
[2:50:14] <%Broand> ALso do that with i-ron
[2:50:17] <xbb1024> dude, you're adding to Pat's goblins
[2:50:23] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat's brain is pudding.
[2:50:23] <%Wurmspawn> Welcome to brain gremlins, the game
[2:50:23] <+Shackle_Rustyford> hes getting brain zaps
[2:50:23] <CappuccinoGuil> Pat, finish your objective first
[2:50:24] <bonebagMEL> Yep
[2:50:24] <+GrandmasterBFunk> what have you done commenter
[2:50:24] <+c4kie> Why would you do that to him
[2:50:26] <%DiscoMatador> BRINE EXPAND
[2:50:26] <+Shackle_Rustyford> hes seeing now
[2:50:27] <NeroInfinite> annd the gobolins begin
[2:50:27] <%takotoots> brain active
[2:50:30] <boogaleeboo> The world will be one factory
[2:50:31] <%darklordfodder> Smelter? Barely even met her.
[2:50:32] <+superblar> Overload!
[2:50:32] <bonebagMEL> This is where the game goes "build belts"
[2:50:35] <Mr_Rakjo> The Attack of the Invinsible GOBOOS
[2:50:35] <NitronStreams> Pat sees the code
[2:50:37] <+c4kie> Breath, mate
[2:50:40] <%blastyoboots> YOU UNDERSTAND NOW
[2:50:40] <CappuccinoGuil> Finish the milestone so you HAVE the auto-miner
[2:50:41] <+JobbedBone> @bigshedman okay cool yeah, would be more of an aesthetic/novelty thing
[2:50:41] <%toolofparanoia> BRAIN BLAST
[2:50:44] <+ExclusivelyPlastic> Just wait until you get splitters and mergers and can start maximizing that efficiency by matching feed rates
[2:50:44] <%XeroSigmaPrime> INSIGHT GAINED
[2:50:45] <%Ebonyglow> no longer does he see the polygons, just lines of code
[2:50:49] <%Spydurman> brine crate-tivity to the maximum
[2:50:49] <+SocialMisfitGamer> @bigshedman wait so you can go ore > miner > smelter > contruster?
[2:50:50] <sendart> Let your creations cover the land
[2:50:51] <NoCreditClear> It's probably better to at least get rhgou htier 0 before worrying too much about this optimization stuff
[2:50:52] <%ssjklyco> Pat sounds like he's about to bust a nut this whole stream.
[2:50:53] <boogaleeboo> The lack of consequence to breaking things up is the best
[2:50:54] <T_Sasquatch> PAT EXPLOSION INCOMING
[2:50:54] <PinoProxie> His third eye opened
[2:50:58] <triggersqueeze1985> Where are those damn arachnids??!!!
[2:50:58] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> I started turning every mining spot into a self-contained factory for a single part.
[2:50:59] <CrematedCube> We're almost ready to unleash the spaghetti
[2:51:03] <+ReallyBigRocks> This is a game of constantly erasing and rebuilding all your shit for marginal improvements
[2:51:04] <jorniev> TAHTS SO FAST
[2:51:04] <+Shackle_Rustyford> honestly this is cathartic is as fuck, seeing someone go through these same mind loops
[2:51:06] <boogaleeboo> Orange in
[2:51:06] <%Broand> wrong way
[2:51:08] <boogaleeboo> heh
[2:51:08] <NitronStreams> wrong way
[2:51:10] <Mr_Rakjo> LUL
[2:51:13] <NitronStreams> LUL
[2:51:15] <%takotoots> LUL
[2:51:17] <+Shackle_Rustyford> you can never get this experience again from these types of games
[2:51:18] <bigshedman> @JobbedBone Yeah if you wanna go ham just to make a cool-looking factory, you totally can. You can daisy-chain pretty much anything.
[2:51:35] <masterfire23> no brain meltdown yet?
[2:51:40] <triggersqueeze1985> Arachnids next update
[2:51:41] <%squidking96> hey pat hows it going, you enjoying satisfactory so far?
[2:51:42] <+TheBobulus> pat, hold ctrl while placing buildings
[2:51:50] <%Broand> Luckily, impure nodes produce just enough iron per second to feed a single smelter
[2:51:52] <%DappercatEsquire> @PatStaresAt does optimizing for efficiency bother your goblins, or is it goblin calming?
[2:51:58] <%toolofparanoia> Just realized you turn your gun sideways to delete something
[2:52:01] <+ReallyBigRocks> lil leg bois
[2:52:10] <bigshedman> @SocialMisfitGamer Yes. You can connect anything, you can have an entire chain of constructor->dissasembler->constructor etc etc. Keep in mind that all these units require fuel though.
[2:52:13] <+Shackle_Rustyford> cant wait for him to discover the value of storage facilities as buffers
[2:52:16] <%Spydurman> @DappercatEsquire his goblins are busting a nut at this game
[2:52:17] <%holydeviant1> Don't forget your massive shipping container storage
[2:52:24] <%jarednotwithsubway> @DappercatEsquire it appears to be calming, surprisingly
[2:52:29] <%Wurmspawn> Gief is a snory boi. It's great.
[2:52:30] <%BinaryFireball> wtf is the handheld thing from startrek called?
[2:52:33] <%BinaryFireball> im blanking hard
[2:52:42] <gryffinp> Phaser?
[2:52:42] <%Broand> Tricorder
[2:52:43] <%Spydurman> tricorder
[2:52:44] <+JobbedBone> phazer
[2:52:44] <Tuna_Can_0> considering how much pat liked building ziplines in death stranding, makes sense he'd like this
[2:52:44] <penitentpendant> I just realized, we can mark Zangief's growth by how deep his snores grow over streams
[2:52:46] <gryffinp> Oh, tricorder?
[2:52:47] <+TheBobulus> tricorder?
[2:52:47] <triggersqueeze1985> Never gun sideways reciepe for disaster
[2:52:47] <+Shackle_Rustyford> phaser
[2:52:47] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> phaser?
[2:52:48] <%toolofparanoia> Phaser
[2:52:51] <NitronStreams> wrong
[2:52:51] <%BinaryFireball> tricorder!
[2:52:52] <%DappercatEsquire> Weird, you'd think he'd have some anxiety about not optimizing hard enough
[2:53:03] <%holydeviant1> I can't wait for the "So I did a little grinding offscreen" stream
[2:53:11] <%holydeviant1> just a massive, enclosed factory
[2:53:14] <+HitchhikingThrough> @DappercatEsquire shut up don't jinx it
[2:53:15] <+ReallyBigRocks> @DappercatEsquire That might come later
[2:53:19] <+NecDW4> lol
[2:53:19] <boogaleeboo> Infinite resources helps with that a bit
[2:53:20] <CappuccinoGuil> @DappercatEsquire the game teaches you how to optimize slowly, it's good at it
[2:53:20] <%takotoots> BRAIN BLAST
[2:53:21] <+RealMichaelPhelps> LEARNING
[2:53:24] <%BinaryFireball> so riddle me this, why do you always have to build a big ass building to construct things when your tricorder thing can insta build a giant ass building?
[2:53:24] <%Cybercobra2> his brain, its growing by the second
[2:53:29] <NoCreditClear> @DappercatEsquire He knows that you get 100% material refund on disassembled stuff, so you can always do it later.
[2:53:32] <bigshedman> @holydeviant1 Loads game -> half the planet is now a factory LUL
[2:53:32] <+JobbedBone> when the new resources are still coming fast, optimization is kind of a waste yeah
[2:53:34] <+RealMichaelPhelps> we have technology
[2:53:37] <%MistyMntns> He's learning everyone!!!
[2:53:38] <%jarednotwithsubway> smell-tor
[2:53:41] <boogaleeboo> You will never lose resources
[2:53:42] <%Wurmspawn> BTW: autominers tend to pump out ore faster than smelters can smelt them so it's actually less effeicient to do everything oneo to one.
[2:53:43] <triggersqueeze1985> Midgar is expanding
[2:53:44] <+JobbedBone> because the new tier will add exponential progress, generally
[2:53:48] <$payatanharkonnen> This is going to blur into 20 hours
[2:53:54] <%Broand> Because you need materials to make big building
[2:54:00] <+Shackle_Rustyford> hes learning
[2:54:00] <%holydeviant1> @bigshedman Not far off, really, this ridge area eventually becomes an entire factory line
[2:54:05] <AXL808> it all goes into the square hole
[2:54:05] <+silentblast93> @PatStaresAt as some more advice whe you unlock storage units chain it  construct>store> constuct
[2:54:07] <%Spydurman> never losing resources and the infinite resources make his goblins go brrrrrrr
[2:54:07] <+Shackle_Rustyford> he has become strong
[2:54:08] <triggersqueeze1985> Emphasis on TOR
[2:54:10] <%Cybercobra2> but what about.. TWO storage containers
[2:54:11] <NitronStreams> He's doing it guys!
[2:54:12] <NeroInfinite> he learnin he planin
[2:54:15] <+Shackle_Rustyford> please stop praying for pat
[2:54:16] <+JobbedBone> gief's sleep apnea BibleThump
[2:54:16] <+InvertableQuasar> @wurmspawn, He doesn't have splitters yet though so no choice
[2:54:17] <%MistyMntns> He is getting Satisfactory at this factory building game.
[2:54:18] <%toolofparanoia> I would watch a full playthrough of this
[2:54:19] <triggersqueeze1985> KOTOR
[2:54:19] <%crimsonharvest> If you are a gamer with ADHD this is likely to get you hyperfixation I know it does for me
[2:54:19] <%DiscoMatador> He is becoming more powerful
[2:54:19] <+Shackle_Rustyford> he has become to powerful
[2:54:21] <penitentpendant> Pat looks at chat, 20 hours have passed, Pat: "Oh no."
[2:54:27] <%DorianCreed> @PatStaresAt Put a gap between the copper smelter and the wire constructor, so you can split the conveyor for wire and other stuff
[2:54:27] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Pat seems Big Happy
[2:54:28] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Is your Hub in the best place it can be?
[2:54:29] <CappuccinoGuil> NO
[2:54:31] <+GrandmasterBFunk> No
[2:54:31] <gryffinp> no
[2:54:32] <%CommanderSqueaks> Here we go
[2:54:32] <%DappercatEsquire> either way, I'm glad he's enjoying it
[2:54:32] <+RealMichaelPhelps> many storages
[2:54:34] <boogaleeboo> The next tier is "More boxes"
[2:54:35] <%CommanderSqueaks> Here we fucking go.
[2:54:37] <%holydeviant1> You will have more next phase
[2:54:37] <triggersqueeze1985> SEKTOR
[2:54:41] <%TheWinged7> i think it gets larger with your bank
[2:54:41] <Ravioli_Ronin> Aw hell yeah no man’s sky
[2:54:45] <%TheWinged7> *with your hub
[2:54:48] <+JobbedBone> LUL
[2:54:50] <T_Sasquatch> Green is not a creative color
[2:54:51] <NitronStreams> OH GOD
[2:54:52] <reonome> is it tho
[2:54:52] <%jarednotwithsubway> LUL
[2:54:53] <ChungusQuest> Premium Goblin Chow
[2:54:56] <%ssjklyco> But is it?
[2:54:56] <NeroInfinite> LUL
[2:54:57] <+D00msDayDan> not until you unlock foundations
[2:54:58] <%SilvaChariot0133> psaGoblin
[2:54:58] <CappuccinoGuil> It doesnt' matter, because you can just MOVE it in SECONDS LUL
[2:54:59] <+triage0> CALLED OUT LUL
[2:54:59] <%depressed_skeleton> What if everything was even tho?..and level?...
[2:55:00] <%DappercatEsquire> oh there we go
[2:55:00] <%Wurmspawn> @InvertableQuasar Yeah, but I want to add to the goblins. :P
[2:55:00] <NoCreditClear> Don't let them ruin this for you pat
[2:55:01] <CHVMPLOO> is it?
[2:55:01] <bigshedman> He's just asking questions Pat Kappa
[2:55:02] <%Valdorick> psaGoblin
[2:55:02] <%Spydurman> LUL
[2:55:03] <%Kaask> but is it though
[2:55:03] <%BinaryFireball> things arent quite alligned
[2:55:03] <+InvertableQuasar> it's in a great place
[2:55:04] <sendart> just build more hubs
[2:55:05] <NitronStreams> BRAIN UNDER THREAT
[2:55:05] <%toolofparanoia> Activin' his OCD
[2:55:06] <Tuna_Can_0> Jebaited
[2:55:06] <%Aeoneth> He says this because it's working
[2:55:06] <%walternatorz> I always ask questions when I want to point out obvious flaws.
[2:55:07] <%chiluzza> Is your hub in the exact center of your plans?
[2:55:07] <akira630> farming goblins LUL
[2:55:08] <%holydeviant1> So yeah, rush the next teir man
[2:55:08] <penitentpendant> Behold! Goblin Bait!
[2:55:08] <+Walopoh> Kappa
[2:55:10] <%JumboCrunchies> Don't fuck with people's mental illnesses, that's fucked up
[2:55:12] <%Jekado> yeah you can easily move it
[2:55:12] <%chiluzza> will everything be symmetrical
[2:55:15] <+TheBobulus> Pat, rush to the upgrade to make concrete floors, and then everything will snap to a grid!!!!
[2:55:17] <$HyperionXV> I think you unlocked build-able storage crates last tier?
[2:55:18] <%jarednotwithsubway> psaGoblin
[2:55:19] <+ccwettr123> location is actually solid.  Many materials nearby
[2:55:20] <%darklordfodder> That's what she said?
[2:55:21] <+terraspan> Yeah, but...
[2:55:25] <BeagleCypher> *A goblin army has arrived!*
[2:55:27] <penitentpendant> So we need a "Low Quality Goblin Bait" meme, now that I think on it
[2:55:28] <+Walopoh> It's easy to move things
[2:55:29] <w68sRambo> But is it really, Pat?
[2:55:30] <EuropanLamprey> Pat, calling him out will just make us all poke the Golbins
[2:55:31] <+robosqueeb> dude getting btfo for just asking a question lol
[2:55:36] <%ssjklyco> Extend
[2:55:43] <+MisterAvry> In Rod We Trust
[2:55:43] <triggersqueeze1985> Ocd mode is now selectable
[2:55:47] <rufus2k2> @PatStaresAt You should play Starcraft 1 Terran music over this
[2:55:47] <+ReallyBigRocks> @PatStaresAt Power lines automatically make poles when you don't connect them to things
[2:55:50] <Tuna_Can_0> Could ____ be more efficient? Yes
[2:55:55] <%Broken_Sonex> THE HUB IS INCORECT. IT IS FLAWED
[2:55:56] <boogaleeboo> 2 rods
[2:56:00] <%maybefalco> two pole
[2:56:00] <%TheWinged7> psaHoldon
[2:56:03] <LVL1_Scumbag> This is why you always make an excess of materials
[2:56:10] <+JobbedBone> Irony has always had a very loose definition Kappa
[2:56:12] <%Jekado> your gonna want 4 power poles...
[2:56:13] <+MisterAvry> is this how Pat slowly descends into Dwarf Fortress?
[2:56:15] <Ravioli_Ronin> Power pole sounds like a lit new event at the club
[2:56:21] <HidalgoBallard> Why not put hub between the 2 ore locations?
[2:56:27] <%depressed_skeleton> In Road we Trust
[2:56:36] <EuropanLamprey> Your Hub is misaligned with your Smelter by half a meter
[2:56:36] <Mr_Rakjo> You put it on the box
[2:56:37] <%Jekado> you need to power 6 things remember that
[2:56:38] <%depressed_skeleton> rod, shit
[2:56:39] <%CapnClassix> Pat Stares At Rimworld when
[2:56:40] <+ReallyBigRocks> Isn't Goku's stick from Dragon Ball the power pole?
[2:56:42] <%Jekado> because the auto drills need power
[2:56:42] <moosemonkey397> dyson sphere is the end of the road imo. the non-euclidean geometry fucks everything
[2:56:43] <boogaleeboo> There are more resources than them too
[2:56:55] <gryffinp> PAt'
[2:57:01] <gryffinp> ahem. Pat's definitely doing it to himself here
[2:57:02] <%MistyMntns> Because putting it in between two ore locations would be too convient for Pat.
[2:57:02] <+Shackle_Rustyford> i had 4 hours between off work and sleep before work tomorrow to play p5r and instead ive spent 2.5 watching this and now considering wasting my sleeping time buying this
[2:57:03] <boogaleeboo> So between the iron and the copper is actually longer away from the limstone
[2:57:06] <boogaleeboo> And so forth
[2:57:06] <%XeroSigmaPrime> OMG Starcraft 1 Terran music WOULD FIT PERFECTLY
[2:57:07] <+Shackle_Rustyford> twitch is good fucking advertising
[2:57:18] <Ravioli_Ronin> Looking up power pole vids on the hub
[2:57:22] <+MisterAvry> Watching a shitton of resources move along belts makes MY goblins pretty happy. How bout you, Pat?
[2:57:25] <boogaleeboo> So basically he should just vibe and do his thing, he'll be fine
[2:57:42] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Im fucking hungry for this game now
[2:57:45] <%TheWinged7> you
[2:57:48] <gryffinp> By jove I think he's got it
[2:57:50] <NitronStreams> 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
[2:57:50] <boogaleeboo> There you go.
[2:57:51] <masterfire23> no brain melt yet, very POGGERS
[2:57:53] <Griffin1171> you did it
[2:57:55] <%crimsonharvest> now amke sure your recipes are right
[2:57:58] <+ReallyBigRocks> AMAZING
[2:58:03] <triggersqueeze1985> ROD CHUNGUS
[2:58:23] <+OwlLightningMage> Pat should play Kenshi
[2:58:26] <+gimmickypizza> I got this kind rush from playing Death stranding
[2:58:27] <+MisterAvry> Rod... Stewart
[2:58:32] <bigshedman> He's starting to believe PogChamp
[2:58:41] <%Nested_Dreams> Is Pat high or I just played too much modded minecraft and this is all obvious to me?
[2:58:42] <heartlesshealer> no don't play kenshi unless it is your exact flavor of game
[2:58:51] <triggersqueeze1985> Rod burgundy
[2:58:52] <%SilvaChariot0133> Standing By
[2:58:52] <Griffin1171> He is... the one
[2:58:56] <$Dakuu75> standby for launch
[2:58:56] <%Wurmspawn> psaHoldon psaHoldon psaHoldon
[2:58:57] <gryffinp> Honestly I didn't like kenshi
[2:59:04] <%depressed_skeleton> Can i have a bit of I-ron? as a treat?
[2:59:06] <+OwlLightningMage> Pat would like Kenshi
[2:59:06] <%jarednotwithsubway> Iran?
[2:59:10] <+ReallyBigRocks> @PatStaresAt don't forget to take the copper off the conveyor
[2:59:10] <$payatanharkonnen> Yes the OCD one
[2:59:13] <+SocialMisfitGamer> Fuck this game is gonna be super addictive
[2:59:14] <gryffinp> oh no the conveyor has a bunch of copper stuck on it
[2:59:16] <BwdYeti> You don't have to standby or take the items out before changing recipes
[2:59:17] <Calek> how's the game going? anyone know how it compares to Factorio?
[2:59:19] <Mr_Rakjo> Take the copper from the belt @PatStaresAt
[2:59:20] <%Broand> how i-ron ic
[2:59:21] <CappuccinoGuil> You can pick it up
[2:59:22] <Griffin1171> clear the conveyer
[2:59:22] <%Jekado> you got copper ingots stuck on the line
[2:59:23] <%CommanderSqueaks> Is that a visual bug?
[2:59:25] <Mr_Rakjo> just take it
[2:59:25] <%Jekado> you got to take it out
[2:59:26] <NitronStreams> take the ingots off the conveyor
[2:59:27] <+ratchetex> can I have little a iron as a treat?
[2:59:27] <+Shackle_Rustyford> get the unclogging tool
[2:59:28] <Griffin1171> just delete
[2:59:28] <%Broand> Just pick it up
[2:59:29] <CappuccinoGuil> Walk over to the belt and pick them up
[2:59:29] <+TheBobulus> dismantle belt to unclog
[2:59:30] <%GarbageNirvana> Kensi looks neat but the learning curve in that game may as well be a sheer cliff face
[2:59:30] <bigshedman> You can pickup the ingots from the belt Pat
[2:59:32] <+MisterAvry> picks it up
[2:59:40] <+ReallyBigRocks> you can just dismantle it
[2:59:40] <gryffinp> @Calek I haven't played factorio but everyone who has just says that satisfactory is just 3d factorio
[2:59:41] <moosemonkey397> disassemble the conveyor
[2:59:41] <%notsoy> take it off the belt manually
[2:59:45] <CappuccinoGuil> Disassemble the belt
[2:59:45] <%Jekado> you can just demolish it
[2:59:47] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> change recipe to use copper so it sucks them up
[2:59:48] <%TheWinged7> finish making the copper stuff first
[2:59:49] <%holydeviant1> let it process
[2:59:50] <+InvertableQuasar> Destroy and recreate belt
[2:59:50] <%CommanderSqueaks> Oh no
[2:59:50] <GlukosWyvern> just rebbuild the belt
[2:59:50] <dustworthmain> make a new belt
[2:59:52] <+Shackle_Rustyford> you have to play MYST
[2:59:52] <Griffin1171> just delete the belt
[2:59:52] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> or delete and replace belt
[2:59:53] <%tank7013> dismantle belt unfortunately
[2:59:53] <%Broand> Just set it to wire for a sec
[2:59:53] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Cue Acne Music
[2:59:54] <%Wurmspawn> Delete the belt.
[2:59:55] <+silentblast93> let it make the wire ant takt it
[2:59:56] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Acme
[2:59:59] <%Jekado> the last one requires you to just delete it and build it again
[3:00:00] <%whyskeywolfe> Dorg is snroring
[3:00:05] <%TheWinged7> @PatStaresAt just elet it make the copper stuff
[3:00:05] <LVL1_Scumbag> Soiled it!
[3:00:12] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Change constructor recipe to use copper ingot works too.
[3:00:16] <%Jekado> yeah its the only annoying thing
[3:00:18] <%crimsonharvest> yeah thats why leaving a bit of space is good, it makes it harder to fuck it up later
[3:00:21] <%Cybercobra2> little bit but its fine
[3:00:21] <NoCreditClear> throw it in the trash, 0/10
[3:00:23] <+Shackle_Rustyford> i thought dog was an animal in game flying above
[3:00:26] <+MisterAvry> When do you build a catapult to finally get the road runner/
[3:00:26] <triggersqueeze1985> Go fuck yourself San Diego
[3:00:27] <+D00msDayDan> don't be afraid to just tear shit down to move it somewhere else
[3:00:32] <softbirby> can hear gief snorin
[3:00:33] <Calek> is that a snoring pupper I hear
[3:00:33] <+OwlLightningMage> There really isn't much to learn in Kenshi. Just don't die and build things. Number go up
[3:00:47] <%depressed_skeleton> What Rods???
[3:00:49] <%CommanderSqueaks> Fucking rods, eh Pat?
[3:00:52] <boogaleeboo> yeah, tearing shit down has no consequences
[3:00:53] <%Jekado> "fucking rods"
[3:00:54] <boogaleeboo> so just do it
[3:00:55] <Parapattern> Some fucking rods
[3:00:57] <%Cybercobra2> fucking rods you say? doodLewd
[3:00:59] <+TheBobulus> has pat found the inventory sort button yet?
[3:01:00] <%Jekado> i don't like the sound of that
[3:01:00] <+ReallyBigRocks> So I think 1 copper smelter can feed 2 wire constructors
[3:01:02] <%GarbageNirvana> idk, the moment I built something in Kenshi a group of bandits came and owned my ass
[3:01:03] <$Dakuu75> gief's snoring REALLY does sounds like a squeeky conveyor belt
[3:01:04] <CappuccinoGuil> Can he make biomass yet?
[3:01:05] <%Cozy90> fuckin tendo
[3:01:06] <$payatanharkonnen> There is a snoring beast near
[3:01:10] <%TheShal> OR. How about another contructor to convert wires into cables for you?
[3:01:12] <%depressed_skeleton> Pollute PLANET
[3:01:12] <%darklordfodder> You can also chain the constructor to make cable...but don't feel pressure to do that yet.
[3:01:14] <%depressed_skeleton> psaGib
[3:01:15] <triggersqueeze1985> I spit hot wire
[3:01:15] <Psyramics> i didn't think this game wsa that horny, everything's fucking on this planet
[3:01:17] <Mr_Rakjo> or make another constuctor connected to the wire one to make cables @PatStaresAt
[3:01:21] <%PocketBearIllustrator> Side note: I like when Pat says "fuck" alot. :P
[3:01:21] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Dakuu75 It adds to the ambiance.
[3:01:23] <gryffinp> @CappuccinoGuil nope!
[3:01:26] <%DiscoMatador> I wonder if there is a way to make Cable production more EFFICIENT
[3:01:26] <+queaks> This game didnt need to be so pretty but Im so happy it is
[3:01:28] <boogaleeboo> Each one is like slightly under a second
[3:01:31] <%Kouseo> what is this game
[3:01:33] <%Cybercobra2> also if you interact with one of your powerpoles, you can see how much energy you are producing and using
[3:01:35] <%holydeviant1> oh now it's just CHONKING them
[3:01:39] <RamenRiderZ> Is Pat enjoying the funny goblin game? Looks fun
[3:01:40] <+silentblast93> wood is better
[3:01:43] <+SocialMisfitGamer> now make a miner and belt that shit
[3:01:45] <+MisterAvry> the sky mantas are cool
[3:01:49] <Final_Cosplay_Corps> pat did you know the flowers are harvestable and used for paint?
[3:01:52] <Tuna_Can_0> @gryffinp its 3d factorio sure, satisfactory has infinite resources though. Factorio has more alien threat and you have to expand to gather more resources
[3:01:55] <Mr_Rakjo> THE BRAIN IS EXPANDING
[3:01:56] <%jarednotwithsubway> look at the horrible black smoke the smelters put out... its beautiful
[3:02:00] <Mr_Rakjo> YUUUGE BRAIN
[3:02:00] <%Broand> Another constructor to make cables from wire?
[3:02:02] <+ReallyBigRocks> HE'S DOING IT
[3:02:02] <%Broand> yeah
[3:02:02] <bigshedman> Yes! YES! He's gonna do it!
[3:02:06] <CappuccinoGuil> Oh this is gonna be fun
[3:02:11] <%holydeviant1> YES YES YES
[3:02:15] <Mr_Rakjo> He is doing it CHAT!
[3:02:16] <NitronStreams> PogChamp
[3:02:17] <$realm_forge> PAT IS EVOLVING BEFORE OUR EYES
[3:02:17] <%MrGuy516> @patstaresat can you build something to automate leaf harvesting?
[3:02:19] <CappuccinoGuil> I am GRINNING
[3:02:21] <+silentblast93> yeah but hes bout to trip a breaker
[3:02:31] <gryffinp> Can the biomass burner support another constructor though
[3:02:32] <NoCreditClear> Now you're thinking with factories
[3:02:36] <%DiscoMatador> NEURON ACTIVATION!!!
[3:02:38] <%Broand> @MrGuy516 Nope, it's why early game power is terrible
[3:02:41] <+queaks> Pat you can use the space bar to construct to give your finger a break
[3:02:46] <CappuccinoGuil> Let him learn, and we'll laugh LUL
[3:02:49] <iosephe> Automation go up
[3:02:52] <+MisterAvry> I hate how much chat for these games gives the streamer shit for not being optimized. Like 80% of the fun of these games is fucking up and slowly figuring out efficiency
[3:03:07] <sendart> praise be to the Omnissiah
[3:03:07] <%SilvaChariot0133> *Snoring*
[3:03:14] <%maybefalco> now you're getting it
[3:03:15] <+dingobroyt> Have you seen Let's Game it Out's crerations in this game.... they are fucked
[3:03:16] <+queaks> The belts are so incredible in this game
[3:03:17] <triggersqueeze1985> Who fell asleep playing the tuba?
[3:03:18] <Final_Cosplay_Corps> strip the land, smooth the wrinkles
[3:03:21] <LVL1_Scumbag> Go spaghetti factory
[3:03:22] <RamenRiderZ> I NEED MORE POWER
[3:03:24] <+MisterAvry> If I wanted to see a well made factory right off the bat I'd go watch reruns of How It's Made
[3:03:24] <%TheWinged7> thanks Vergil
[3:03:26] <Yakobro> "I need more POWER"
[3:03:28] <NeroInfinite> Imagine his surprise when eh finds the fplitters.
[3:03:31] <bigshedman> Construct more Yamato's, Pat.
[3:03:33] <Darthkitten_Prime> INDUSTRY
[3:03:33] <boogaleeboo> See some people like to build the factories on top of each other
[3:03:35] <%notsoy> no you need cable
[3:03:37] <+Shackle_Rustyford> GIVE ME FUEL GIVE ME FIRE GIVE ME THAT WHICH I DESIRE
[3:03:38] <%darklordfodder> I miss that feeling of first discovering Factorio.
[3:03:38] <+Shackle_Rustyford> HUEH
[3:03:39] <penitentpendant> Become... VERGIL IN A HARDHAT
[3:03:42] <+HitchhikingThrough> so this is how pat turns into an anime villain
[3:03:42] <BerryliciousDefinition> Unlimited...POWER
[3:03:46] <+crazyspartan214> Dogge snore
[3:03:46] <boogaleeboo> But if you build them further apart you get to see all your items moving around
[3:03:47] <%SilvaChariot0133> psaDogchamp
[3:03:50] <%notsoy> you should have one leftover power node spot
[3:03:54] <%Broand> You're making wire
[3:03:55] <boogaleeboo> And that is so deeply emotionally satisfying
[3:03:55] <+PersonifiedTFT> judgement cut industry
[3:03:56] <Calek> @MisterAvry totally agree, I've restarted Dyson Sphere Program like 5 times trying to be more efficient each time
[3:03:56] <%darklordfodder> Factorio also has a free demo to give you a small taste, FYI.
[3:03:59] <triggersqueeze1985> Nim.....wait for it....ROD
[3:04:04] <+queaks> Im really enjoying watching pat play this. He vocalizes his entire thought process
[3:04:23] <+BusterRepukken> cable
[3:04:25] <NitronStreams> CAble
[3:04:30] <skyentombment> Iron rod? More like Superpower ring amirite?
[3:04:31] <+thegalvanicpanic> I hope Pat doesn't get discouraged should he see someone else's big ass factory line. I enjoy the little goblin man scrambling for resources to build things
[3:04:33] <%darklordfodder> Pat + this game is a dream come true.
[3:04:39] <penitentpendant> @HitchhikingThrough I mean, "I look at the moon and see perfection." is an excellent villain quote for him
[3:04:42] <+MisterAvry> it's like Baba Is You but with more components
[3:04:49] <zedravan> time to go into minit speak
[3:04:53] <%Broand> pole to pole
[3:04:56] <EvanDude47> the 3/4 one
[3:05:08] <Zaphire_Saucypants> tempted to get this game now
[3:05:09] <EvanDude47> thats why you leave an open one
[3:05:12] <+MisterAvry> yee happy wires
[3:05:13] <triggersqueeze1985> Tuba tuba tuba
[3:05:19] <Freddo2796> man the factario update looks sick
[3:05:20] <gryffinp> oh good it didn't trip the breaker
[3:05:21] <halfmasks> oh my god he's beginning to believe
[3:05:23] <Griffin1171> clip thatg
[3:05:24] <%Broand> You can check your power by using a power pole
[3:05:24] <xbb1024> Industry!
[3:05:24] <%crimsonharvest> seeing those spools roll by sort of makes my dick perk up
[3:05:25] <%MisterRockett> How's Pat's creativity going?
[3:05:25] <triggersqueeze1985> Zzzz
[3:05:28] <+queaks> Reminds me of attack of the clones
[3:05:29] <%MelBrooksKA> Pat stares at Satisfactory, aka Pat does crack for a few hours
[3:05:31] <moosemonkey397> satisfactory is p great
[3:05:32] <PinoProxie> *happy pat noisesz*
[3:05:34] <@SSaryn> lol rods Kappa
[3:05:36] <SparkAfterDark> he's beginning to believe
[3:05:40] <+bluedude153> So is this you finally coming to term with games like minecraft
[3:05:40] <@commanderclaw> Now Pat understands why Industrialists destroyed the earth, it's super fun
[3:05:48] <$realm_forge> This needs a daft punk soundtrack
[3:06:02] <CappuccinoGuil> @bluedude153 this is different, though. It's 100% efficiency based
[3:06:03] <BwdYeti> You should finish the current milestone
[3:06:03] <%TheWinged7> But @PatStaresAt what if you need just copper wire and not cable? psaGoblin
[3:06:03] <Mr_Rakjo> Better Faster Stronger
[3:06:04] <NoCreditClear> pat's like on the verge of tears he's so happy to be doing mental math to make number go up
[3:06:10] <%Broand> eye rawn
[3:06:15] <+HitchhikingThrough> NEED MORE POWER
[3:06:19] <%holydeviant1> it eats based on use
[3:06:21] <CappuccinoGuil> "Leaves are good" huh? LUL
[3:06:21] <EvanDude47> juice if flowing
[3:06:23] <gryffinp> running that shit at capacity
[3:06:23] <+BusterRepukken> the more power you use, the faster you burn resources
[3:06:24] <+Partialrecall2> i say i-ron one time and larry king is up my ass for 4 fuckin days
[3:06:24] <EvanDude47> *is
[3:06:25] <+MisterAvry> It needs the rube goldberg machine music from Pee Wee's Big Adventure
[3:06:28] <boogaleeboo> Yeah, exponential power growth do be a bitch
[3:06:28] <%blastyoboots> MORE LEAVEDS
[3:06:29] <%Jekado> FEED THE MACHINE PAT
[3:06:29] <penitentpendant> Biomass, he needs MOAR BIOMASS
[3:06:31] <Mr_Rakjo> its almost like only 1 generator powering like 7 machines is inneficient LUL
[3:06:31] <%darklordfodder> Wood is more efficient I think.
[3:06:33] <%Jekado> FEED ME!!!
[3:06:34] <%Broand> yeah you're pushing up against your power limit
[3:06:36] <moosemonkey397> construct additional pylons
[3:06:36] <%holydeviant1> you'll have a chainsaw soon enough
[3:06:37] <triggersqueeze1985> Sir I Ron the Hard first of his name
[3:06:40] <%BigDumBeak> quick paranoid question, this game have an autosave? or should he save the game? aaa
[3:06:40] <+TheCrispyBoi> i take it that pat likes the game
[3:06:41] <+PersonifiedTFT> Pat's been edging basically the entire time he's been streaming
[3:06:42] <skyentombment> Eyeron is a great name for a product made by Pat Stares at Industries LLC
[3:06:43] <CappuccinoGuil> You're burning through 1 leave in LESS THAN A SECOND LUL
[3:06:44] <+queaks> BURN THE PLANET
[3:06:47] <%DappercatEsquire> imagine, an entire industrial line, powered by leaves
[3:06:47] <+SocialMisfitGamer> The tagline for this game, should be "NEED MORE!!!"
[3:06:51] <triggersqueeze1985> And protector of the realm
[3:06:54] <+CaptainInvictus> oh god, he's getting into the factory game types. so when is he trying Factorio?
[3:06:58] <%Jekado> wait until you get THE SAW
[3:06:59] <+Ricmeister> make biomass it burns slower
[3:07:01] <+MisterAvry> when you reach your grass power limit it's time to try LSD
[3:07:02] <GlukosWyvern> Upgrade your hub to get more power
[3:07:03] <%blastyoboots> maybe some animal corpses will help
[3:07:05] <+silentblast93> no thats not grass that the biomass burner
[3:07:09] <Final_Cosplay_Corps> yes make it smooth
[3:07:12] <gryffinp> @Ricmeister Can't yet
[3:07:15] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> this looks like no mans sky gathering/crafting but 1000% better
[3:07:18] <+queaks> Cute smokestacks
[3:07:19] <%TheWinged7> guess you should upgrade your base so that it can use better power
[3:07:21] <+ReallyBigRocks> Wood works better than grass, biomass is better than that and biofuel is even better
[3:07:22] <%AzureGale> Awwwwwwwww
[3:07:24] <CappuccinoGuil> Nah
[3:07:26] <+HitchhikingThrough> OH YOU FUCKING BET
[3:07:27] <iosephe> hellllll yeah
[3:07:27] <%holydeviant1> Nope
[3:07:28] <+queaks> Nope
[3:07:28] <SpaceManHotepIV> it's real cure
[3:07:28] <%Jekado> Nope
[3:07:28] <penitentpendant> Look, as long as this game doesn't have 'pigfarms to feed the biomass burner' tech tree
[3:07:29] <%Broand> nope
[3:07:29] <%Cybercobra2> nah polution aint a thing
[3:07:29] <BwdYeti> No
[3:07:30] <%Wurmspawn> No
[3:07:30] <SpaceManHotepIV> cute
[3:07:31] <Veluren> No, not like other exploitation games
[3:07:31] <$HyperionXV> Only radiation
[3:07:31] <bigshedman> Polluting is just a form littering
[3:07:32] <%AzureGale> We got a Captain Planet villain in the making
[3:07:32] <+BusterRepukken> i dont think, not yet anyway
[3:07:34] <%holydeviant1> Not yet, anyway
[3:07:34] <+HitchhikingThrough> oh
[3:07:34] <+D00msDayDan> too bad there's no pollution
[3:07:35] <%Broand> pollute all you like
[3:07:35] <+HitchhikingThrough> i'm wrong
[3:07:35] <gryffinp> Nope, fuck the environment
[3:07:37] <%RyTYoung> Are you satisfied? Kappa
[3:07:39] <$SGrim> Pollute-chan is so cute
[3:07:39] <%whyskeywolfe> No, as in real life pollution has no effect.
[3:07:40] <heartlesshealer> =)
[3:07:40] <%DianaTheAscian> not yet prob @PatStaresAt
[3:07:41] <+HitchhikingThrough> wait what about the radiation?
[3:07:41] <+MistyMntns> @PatStaresAt Wait. Are you manually putting in your resources into the constructors?
[3:07:41] <NitronStreams> Yesn't
[3:07:41] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Yeah it makes your dick big
[3:07:42] <%Jekado> Not... yet.... at least
[3:07:42] <RamenRiderZ> Industrial Dopamine
[3:07:43] <%blastyoboots> Factorio has pollution
[3:07:44] <%Agami23> factorio has pollution, this does not.
[3:07:45] <GunEden> only in factorio
[3:07:45] <Megalofyte> One day you'll get coal and be a real industrialist
[3:07:45] <Tuna_Can_0> idk lol
[3:07:46] <SparkAfterDark> hmm mayhap you could ... automate that process
[3:07:47] <moosemonkey397> it depends what kind of pollution :)
[3:07:48] <%holydeviant1> Later buildings produce waste
[3:07:48] <%darklordfodder> Factorio has pollution, it makes the Zerg attack you.
[3:07:49] <@SSaryn> "Look at this cute little factory I have and I'm polluting!"
[3:07:49] <Psyramics> factorio does
[3:07:51] <+Partialrecall2> not our planet lol
[3:07:52] <+BusterRepukken> They might add Pollution in a patch since this is early access
[3:07:53] <DrkJP520> "I'm polluting!" *giggle*
[3:07:54] <+HitchhikingThrough> I thought the radiation did something
[3:07:54] <CappuccinoGuil> @HitchhikingThrough it's different
[3:07:56] <EvanDude47> in factorio pollution makes mobs angry so they attack you more
[3:07:59] <+queaks> I mean there is problems... when you go nuclear
[3:07:59] <%Dunmarkh> if you love pollution do  factorio
[3:08:01] <moosemonkey397> doesnt nuclear have polliution?
[3:08:03] <LVL1_Scumbag> Factorio has a pollution mechanic that makes bugs angry
[3:08:03] <PinoProxie> Delicious rods
[3:08:03] <BwdYeti> Pollution does stuff in Factorio, that's where you have to watch out/burn the world down
[3:08:04] <triggersqueeze1985> Global warming
[3:08:06] <$SGrim> Pollute-chan hungers for your iron rod. Kreygasm
[3:08:09] <%Wurmspawn> Polution is a Factoris thing, though radiation and toxic gases are things to watch out for.
[3:08:10] <NoCreditClear> Pat: You'll unlock more efficient biomass one milestone from now, so don't stress it at the moment.
[3:08:12] <+SocialMisfitGamer> 2 BURNERS
[3:08:13] <+MisterAvry> wait so with no pollution what's the conflict?
[3:08:16] <%Jekado> check the back
[3:08:17] <Mr_Rakjo> MORE BIOMASS BURNERS PogChamp
[3:08:19] <%holydeviant1> TWO BURNERS
[3:08:19] <RamenRiderZ> PogChamp
[3:08:20] <%Jekado> now you have 2 generators
[3:08:21] <%tank7013> @hitchhikingthrough It kills you
[3:08:22] <%Wurmspawn> Factorio*
[3:08:23] <EvanDude47> second burner
[3:08:24] <Tuna_Can_0> alien bugs don't like pollution monkaS
[3:08:24] <+silentblast93> @PatStaresAt pat the biomass burner max is 20 mw and palution dose if its nuclear power cause you can radiate the area cause the waste
[3:08:24] <xbb1024> you have 2 burners now
[3:08:24] <TurtlesAndTentacles> I feel like Vision. "what is it that we do here?"
[3:08:31] <EuropanLamprey> Pat so wants to turn this planet into Venus
[3:08:36] <RamenRiderZ> GlitchLit GlitchLit GlitchLit
[3:08:37] <topiodonk> yo, this looks nice
[3:08:38] <triggersqueeze1985> Ada!
[3:08:49] <NitronStreams> you can now fully automate the process from mineing to crafting
[3:08:51] <+ReallyBigRocks> nope, need more poles
[3:08:52] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Pollution**
[3:08:58] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Weirdly, this burner is on a different network. It's silly.
[3:08:58] <gryffinp> Yeah, I guess that works
[3:09:02] <%Cybercobra2> DOUBLE POWEEEEEER
[3:09:10] <%Broand> Miner time
[3:09:18] <triggersqueeze1985> Zipline
[3:09:22] <LVL1_Scumbag> Unlimited power!
[3:09:22] <gryffinp> storage containers are The Way
[3:09:26] <kazadaz> Pat you left the windscreen wipers on
[3:09:30] <+HitchhikingThrough> chests
[3:09:31] <iosephe> no
[3:09:33] <+MisterAvry> stick em right on the "output"?
[3:09:35] <moosemonkey397> buffers
[3:09:36] <%Broand> It auto outputs
[3:09:36] <+BusterRepukken> coveryor belt into storage
[3:09:37] <bubbli97> is that Zangief in the background?
[3:09:37] <BwdYeti> On the output of the constructor
[3:09:38] <zedravan> buffer
[3:09:38] <%Broand> as a buffer
[3:09:41] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Overflow protection, yeah
[3:09:42] <xbb1024> They also work great as buffers for later
[3:09:42] <%Jekado> because
[3:09:43] <CappuccinoGuil> they are chests for production
[3:09:45] <+ReallyBigRocks> It works like a item buffer
[3:09:45] <skyentombment> BUT HOW CAN THIS BEEEEEE
[3:09:46] <RzdAkira> Buffer
[3:09:50] <%notsoy> you can feed stuff straight into a storage container
[3:09:54] <+silentblast93> its to daisy chain the stuff
[3:09:54] <%BigDumBeak> i love geif snore it sounds like a constant muffled fart metronome
[3:09:54] <%blastyoboots> overflow buffer
[3:09:54] <%Jekado> also if you need it to craft things
[3:09:56] <%notsoy> it doesn't need power
[3:09:59] <%crimsonharvest> You can always just set up new buildings to see how they work with no risk
[3:10:00] <CappuccinoGuil> The constructor can only hold 1 full stack of an item
[3:10:01] <%Nested_Dreams> Machine holds only one stack, crate holds many stacks
[3:10:04] <+queaks> Time to build miners
[3:10:05] <EvanDude47> what if you wanted to store wires in your current production line?
[3:10:07] <EvanDude47> storage
[3:10:13] <triggersqueeze1985> Rod Chungus
[3:10:14] <CappuccinoGuil> yup
[3:10:15] <boogaleeboo> Effectively this is all extra
[3:10:15] <%Jekado> oddly converyors don't need power
[3:10:15] <+silentblast93> no pat work on setting up the auto miners
[3:10:16] <%Broand> Yeah
[3:10:17] <+BusterRepukken> yeah this game isn't stressful
[3:10:20] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> You can lead storage into the smelter to offload your ore
[3:10:21] <%Jekado> get use to hearing the power cut out
[3:10:24] <+MisterAvry> Is it me, or do the buildings have a Death Stranding-y aesthetic to them?
[3:10:26] <%Jekado> its so fucking Jaring
[3:10:27] <boogaleeboo> You can do all the things you need to do with your knife and just craft yourself
[3:10:30] <Griffin1171> The factory will wait for you
[3:10:34] <NitronStreams> Miner->storage->smelter...etc
[3:10:35] <+queaks> They are adding batteries in the next patch. SO excited
[3:10:39] <boogaleeboo> Losing all this can't fuck you
[3:10:45] <kazadaz> code for having a baby
[3:10:46] <%holydeviant1> Grab some BOYS
[3:10:52] <%TheWinged7> yarp
[3:10:52] <huskarl_zap> Frost punk > This
[3:10:53] <+MisterAvry> Yeah I like that you can't just round out of X and be fucked
[3:10:54] <Visorak6> Is there an overview map where you can see the layout of your stuff?
[3:10:54] <%Cybercobra2> you upgrade one of your lil'l bois to a BIG boy
[3:10:56] <+queaks> Pick up your miner bros. Time to upgrade them
[3:11:06] <+MisterAvry> steenky boi
[3:11:06] <triggersqueeze1985> X gon
[3:11:08] <bonebagMEL> stinkee
[3:11:08] <huskarl_zap> SPITE NUT?
[3:11:08] <%TheWinged7> stink
[3:11:09] <%takotoots> LUL
[3:11:09] <gryffinp> did he stinky
[3:11:10] <bigshedman> uh oh stinky
[3:11:10] <+ReallyBigRocks> uhoh stinky pig dog
[3:11:11] <+NecDW4> LOL
[3:11:13] <triggersqueeze1985> Give it to ya
[3:11:17] <Griffin1171> Zangief took a dump
[3:11:17] <%whyskeywolfe> Dog do a poo
[3:11:17] <%AzureGale> Actual Fart Gas
[3:11:18] <%Wurmspawn> Who's talking!!
[3:11:18] <+CaptainInvictus> this seems like baby's first factorio in 3D.  I just started factorio and that shit is fuckin nuuuuuuuuts
[3:11:18] <@SSaryn> psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp
[3:11:21] <%GarbageNirvana> he psaBig stink
[3:11:21] <%holydeviant1> uh oh, stinky
[3:11:22] <NoCreditClear> The hard part is being 100 miles away from your base and not realizing you don't have a portable miner and can't build one lol
[3:11:24] <huskarl_zap> SPITE FARD
[3:11:26] <kazadaz> canadian dog fart death
[3:11:31] <triggersqueeze1985> Gas gas dawn your mask
[3:11:34] <%baka_sugoi> F A R T
[3:11:36] <Decahexa> Pig Dog have big strong farts
[3:11:38] <topiodonk> my puppy does that too, sometimes i live the room its so bad
[3:11:39] <+SocialMisfitGamer> @PatStaresAt you might have to move your whole setup in order to be closer to your ore spots.
[3:11:40] <gryffinp> @NoCreditClear why not, just slap down an equipment workshop
[3:11:41] <+MisterAvry> dog farts are something else
[3:11:43] <triggersqueeze1985> Fatty pig shit
[3:11:43] <RamenRiderZ> Farting the nightmares away
[3:11:48] <SparkAfterDark> air pollution level has reached critical levels
[3:11:50] <%Broand> The limit from miners is the number of nodes you have really
[3:11:59] <%holydeviant1> @SocialMisfitGamer nah, ust do BIG conveyor
[3:12:08] <moosemonkey397> SURPRISE
[3:12:08] <+queaks> Why not place workshop on the other side?
[3:12:09] <bonebagMEL> This game fucks
[3:12:10] <moosemonkey397> big long game
[3:12:11] <gryffinp> yeah this game
[3:12:13] <+MisterAvry> oh yeah, the space elevator
[3:12:14] <%holydeviant1> SPACE ELEVATOR TIME
[3:12:14] <%Treuan> Aww yeah
[3:12:14] <gryffinp> this game has some content
[3:12:16] <$realm_forge> Is there a way to counter the dog farts or does it come with owning a bulldog?
[3:12:16] <%Ranryu692> Space Elevator?
[3:12:17] <%Jekado> thats not even all the tech
[3:12:17] <boogaleeboo> Counterpoint: If you are far from the ore spot, you get to watch the ore travel on a belt longer!
[3:12:18] <+SocialMisfitGamer> @SocialMisfitGamer alright
[3:12:19] <%crimsonharvest> N O L I M I T S
[3:12:19] <EvanDude47> content
[3:12:21] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> just notice
[3:12:21] <+PersonifiedTFT> SPACE ELEVATOR
[3:12:22] <%Jekado> THERE IS MORE TECH
[3:12:24] <+MisterAvry> shits cool as balls
[3:12:25] <softbirby> Anyone else who has owned/owns a dog get hit with dog fart smells the second they mentioned it
[3:12:27] <NoCreditClear> @gryffinp Believe it or not I've lacked the resources to do so after making a hike lol.
[3:12:27] <+OwlLightningMage> I don't know what this game is
[3:12:27] <CappuccinoGuil> The other side of the HUB
[3:12:27] <+queaks> Seems annoying to walk through the door like that
[3:12:27] <%Dunmarkh> no other side of the hub
[3:12:27] <softbirby> because fuck
[3:12:31] <%DiscoMatador> The other side of the hub
[3:12:34] <Griffin1171> so your door is clear
[3:12:35] <%Dunmarkh> so you stop running into it
[3:12:36] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Of the hub, so you don't run through it every time?
[3:12:39] <kazadaz> wait til he discovers the time travel logistics
[3:12:40] <%Nested_Dreams> Just place it not in the way
[3:12:45] <triggersqueeze1985> Oh shit it’s daytime
[3:12:47] <%DorianCreed> THAT LAND LOOKS TOO PRISTINE
[3:12:49] <+OwlLightningMage> Is this literally a game of building things?
[3:12:54] <SparkAfterDark> how long until gun?
[3:13:04] <%Broand> Building big things
[3:13:07] <kazadaz> The building style reminds me of a bunch of Titanfall 2 maps
[3:13:09] <+MisterAvry> even that dogs snores sound kinda like farts
[3:13:10] <+queaks> Soon you can make it go up
[3:13:12] <+SocialMisfitGamer> it will
[3:13:14] <NitronStreams> need platforms
[3:13:17] <%Cybercobra2> dont worry you get stuff for that
[3:13:21] <RzdAkira> The ground is not level
[3:13:24] <zedravan> soon tm
[3:13:26] <%Broand> You won't have to wish in a second
[3:13:27] <+mcburgers3000> The hub is probably not in the best spot
[3:13:28] <+JobbedBone> industrial park PogChamp
[3:13:29] <boogaleeboo> It's a game about turning a planet into a factory
[3:13:29] <Griffin1171> just rotate your entire hub!
[3:13:29] <+queaks> Snap is always to the middle
[3:13:30] <+OwlLightningMage> Is this like Subnautica but no water?
[3:13:32] <Tuna_Can_0> @OwlLightningMage atpCap
[3:13:33] <NoCreditClear> @PatStaresAt How freeing is the knowledge of Full Refunds on materials?
[3:13:44] <+OwlLightningMage> Didn't Pat hate Subnautica?
[3:13:45] <+TopTieramisu> sleep apnea gief
[3:13:45] <%DiscoMatador> If only there was some kind of Liquid stone that could be used to create a flat surface hmmmmmm
[3:13:47] <EuropanLamprey> ! MISALIGNED !
[3:13:48] <%Broand> This is factorio except 3d
[3:13:50] <%Jekado> @OwlLightningMage no its like 3d factorio
[3:13:51] <triggersqueeze1985> How far away is gief in relation to the microphone
[3:13:51] <+MisterAvry> @OwlLightningMage and more conveyor belts
[3:13:57] <BwdYeti> No, Subnautica doesn't have automated resource production, just crafting
[3:13:58] <triggersqueeze1985> Miles I’m assuming
[3:14:00] <+TensecondTarvis> holy crap hes doing it!
[3:14:01] <%notsoy> still need materials for two miners
[3:14:01] <%Bentusi1634> This is a game where you might be expected to break down and rebuild your factory once you get better tech
[3:14:02] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> MIne Mk1
[3:14:07] <+queaks> Subnautica is less resource generous. Makes you do more searching
[3:14:08] <%AncelDeLambert> Geif snoring is making me so sleepy
[3:14:14] <ammobasket> Concrete
[3:14:22] <kazadaz> those are farts not snores
[3:14:25] <%tank7013> @owllightningmage There's no survival and the vast majority of resources are infinite
[3:14:27] <$realm_forge> WTF was that?!
[3:14:30] <CappuccinoGuil> yes
[3:14:33] <xbb1024> yeah
[3:14:33] <+Jekado> yeah biomass is infinte
[3:14:34] <%crimsonharvest> you are going to do every kind of power you know of
[3:14:34] <%Broand> Coal
[3:14:34] <%DiscoMatador> I wonder
[3:14:35] <%Cybercobra2> they do not grow back. and yes you are
[3:14:35] <%holydeviant1> YEP
[3:14:35] <+MisterAvry> you should be able to shift click or something to pick up all without even opening the menu
[3:14:35] <NoCreditClear> Yes, eventually
[3:14:36] <%darklordfodder> Yes.
[3:14:36] <BwdYeti> Eventually yes
[3:14:36] <+D00msDayDan> oh yeah
[3:14:37] <+queaks> I thought geif snoring was his factory
[3:14:37] <+BusterRepukken> cut down trees eventually, oil comes later
[3:14:37] <KShirahama> yes
[3:14:37] <Griffin1171> yup
[3:14:38] <Broand> to begin with
[3:14:39] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> yes
[3:14:39] <Rashnam> I don't know about the rest of you, but I choose to interpret Gief's noises as ambient noises coming from the alien creatures.
[3:14:40] <+Walopoh> Holy shit that's Zangief? I thought those noises were the aliens
[3:14:40] <DannyMcgee> The relaxing sounds for snorefarting.
[3:14:42] <Griffin1171> coal first, tho
[3:14:42] <huskarl_zap> what a boomer question
[3:14:42] <+ReallyBigRocks> Yeah theres coal and oil
[3:14:43] <%Jekado> yes crude oil is VERY MUCH A THING
[3:14:44] <%Broand> but that's a bit later
[3:14:45] <%darklordfodder> And Uranium? Or is that not in yet?
[3:14:45] <$HyperionXV> Coal exists.
[3:14:53] <%Rumbutt> With Pat playing this just becomes Dr Robotnik simulartor
[3:14:58] <%Cn_alpha_02> Yes
[3:14:58] <%MistyMntns> Uranium is slated to come soon
[3:14:58] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> oh this looks like comfy building
[3:15:01] <kazadaz> gief's nose is a 1-way valve, air's gotta come out somewhere
[3:15:02] <%notsoy> are nuclear power plants in this thing yet?
[3:15:03] <%Cybercobra2> @darklordfodder uranium is athing, its the final thing in the game untill the next update
[3:15:04] <%Broand> Uranium is in but it will kill you
[3:15:12] <+queaks> Put it in containers!!
[3:15:12] <+ReallyBigRocks> @darklordfodder nuclear power is in
[3:15:18] <+MisterAvry> Storage units
[3:15:19] <%Jekado> storage you'll need a lot later
[3:15:19] <boogaleeboo> hub upgrades are always a safe goal
[3:15:23] <%holydeviant1> Just shove it in containers
[3:15:23] <kazadaz> use it to increase your production
[3:15:23] <%Cybercobra2> @mistymntns uranium is a thing already
[3:15:24] <RzdAkira> Awww, so cute
[3:15:26] <CappuccinoGuil> Containers and Miners
[3:15:27] <triggersqueeze1985> Fuck double platinum we’re going triple uranium son!!!
[3:15:28] <NoCreditClear> Put it in a storage container like god intended
[3:15:28] <+MisterAvry> you're probably gonna need it later
[3:15:30] <%darklordfodder> Is there solar as well? I've barely played this game.
[3:15:34] <+OwlLightningMage> I have a hard time playing a building game where nothing is trying to kill me
[3:15:38] <+queaks> Its not like you have the entire planet or anything
[3:15:39] <+Walopoh> I thought Gief's snores were the game audio LUL Like alien/factory noises
[3:15:39] <+HyTricksy> i wish i could play this but i cant find a 3070 to buy to save my life
[3:15:40] <%holydeviant1> Does he not have foundations?
[3:15:40] <Darthkitten_Prime> Man, I'm really happy for Pat. First he gets married, and then he makes a major breakthrough in his mindgoblins.
[3:15:40] <Griffin1171> spaghetti
[3:15:42] <%Jekado> you'll find out nothing is wide enough
[3:15:42] <huskarl_zap> first person facortio?
[3:15:45] <SparkAfterDark> make more.  faster.
[3:15:50] <boogaleeboo> You could tear apart your entire setup and rebuild it in 4 minutes if you wanted to
[3:15:51] <xbb1024> yeah, soon you will be able to build multi level
[3:15:52] <%crimsonharvest> the best part about wanting to tear down everything and do it better is the game is there for you, it has a mass delete.
[3:15:53] <%Jekado> i just build over the ocean some just build over the void
[3:15:53] <%Treuan> He snor
[3:15:56] <%GarbageNirvana> Rememeber you've got those conveyor lifters
[3:16:02] <+TheBobulus> BTW, Pat, containers stack
[3:16:03] <+queaks> Up top looks flat
[3:16:05] <boogaleeboo> It's just a question of what you want
[3:16:09] <triggersqueeze1985> Troll
[3:16:11] <jorniev> this game could use a map
[3:16:12] <kazadaz> The Factory Must Grow
[3:16:12] <%Jekado> @crimsonharvest mass delete has a limit of 50 items tho
[3:16:13] <Griffin1171> look at all that virgin land
[3:16:13] <+JobbedBone> aight just ban fister hes just a pot stirrer
[3:16:16] <+MisterAvry> like down at the docks
[3:16:18] <+BusterRepukken> man you're really asking for it fister lmao
[3:16:22] <+ReallyBigRocks> container tower
[3:16:23] <%Broand> If I may use a cliche, but you see that mountain? you can climb it
[3:16:33] <%notsoy> stack as in you can put them on top of each other?
[3:16:41] <+OwlLightningMage> I'm excited to find out which mind goblin will cause Pat to drop this game too
[3:16:45] <+HitchhikingThrough> ok yeah, troll detected
[3:16:45] <%BoxNavy> oh pat didnt ban fister? weird.

[3:17:44] <+JobbedBone> lol you're the only one talking about it

[3:17:46] <Tuna_Can_0> @fisterofgods atpRtsd
[3:17:49] <+ReallyBigRocks> @notsoy if you put them facing alternate directions you can use the item elevators to make giant crates feeding from one to the next
[3:17:52] <Captain_Joe1911> BOP tansy5Tuntun
[3:17:54] <@SoFarFetched> No he's being an ass on purpose.
[3:18:01] <+TopTieramisu> it's been two decades

[3:18:06] <huskarl_zap> Probably a newblood publisher
[3:18:08] <%BigDumBeak> yaaay do it!

[3:18:24] <DaKnightWarrior> That guy needs to get over it.

[3:18:27] <%viewtifulr> lytUSEGUN lytUSEGUN
[3:18:27] <%MistyMntns> psaWrong
[3:18:28] <CHVMPLOO> kbradIVORY kbradEBONY

[3:18:29] <+Shackle_Rustyford> this is a pretty based chat game
[3:18:33] <anAngryHamster> Talk shit, get hit
[3:18:33] <%Cybercobra2> automisation is a magical thing
[3:18:34] <jimbop444> a game that games itself
[3:18:34] <%Dunmarkh> psaSmug
[3:18:35] <triggersqueeze1985> You chosen death
[3:18:36] <%AimlessStranger> banhammer
[3:18:37] <%darklordfodder> Yeah, I mean he made a death threat "joke".
[3:18:38] <+queaks> Flat place up top?
[3:18:39] <CappuccinoGuil> Dude, I would literally just start the game and live it on for a bit to let it grind for me LUL
[3:18:41] <+MisterAvry> oh yeah, you can fight with chat for a minute and just come back to more resources
[3:18:41] <DaKnightWarrior> lytUSEGUN die
[3:18:41] <%TheWinged7> @PatStaresAt at the output of your pipelines
[3:18:42] <%Broken_Sonex> Oh man, can't wait for his apeal!
[3:18:46] <%crimsonharvest> DO IT
[3:18:47] <+SocialMisfitGamer> do it
[3:18:47] <%TheWinged7> do it
[3:18:48] <Zaphire_Saucypants> do it
[3:18:50] <%holydeviant1> oh no
[3:18:51] <%toolofparanoia> Good riddance to trash!
[3:18:52] <zedravan> yeye
[3:18:52] <MaraSmug> Factory keeps going as you get to ban people LUL perfect game
[3:18:53] <iosephe> DO IT
[3:18:53] <+BusterRepukken> thats totally possible
[3:18:54] <%holydeviant1> the goblins
[3:18:54] <$SGrim> Oh no. It's happening
[3:18:55] <boogaleeboo> Go take a walk, check things out
[3:18:56] <KShirahama> do it
[3:18:56] <+BusterRepukken> it's easy
[3:18:56] <Tuna_Can_0> oh no
[3:18:57] <+HitchhikingThrough> Find a bigger flat area
[3:18:57] <NitronStreams> you can always move everything
[3:18:57] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Do it
[3:18:57] <+FoolsArcade> do it
[3:18:59] <%AncelDeLambert> @PatStaresAt storage container goes best between build points
[3:18:59] <BerryliciousDefinition> yes
[3:18:59] <+ReallyBigRocks> @PatStaresAt that's how the game go, restarting often lol
[3:19:00] <heartlesshealer> HERE'S THE BRAIN SPIDERS
[3:19:00] <+queaks> Up above pat. its flat up there. Flat = good
[3:19:02] <+mcburgers3000> The field above!
[3:19:02] <triggersqueeze1985> Dew it
[3:19:02] <NoCreditClear> AT LEAST FINISH TIER 0 FIRST
[3:19:02] <boogaleeboo> THE FACTORIES WORK FOR YOU, WORKING IS FOR SUCKERS
[3:19:03] <jorniev> this game needs a map
[3:19:03] <gryffinp> Deleting all the shit and starting over is unironically a good idea but finish tier 0 first
[3:19:03] <%BoxNavy> cant believe i have worse mind goblins than pat becuase this game scared the shit out of me once i finished the tutorial
[3:19:04] <+SocialMisfitGamer> there's a field of grass behind
[3:19:04] <%walternatorz> psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin
[3:19:04] <xbb1024> you don't need to delete everything, just move to a new location
[3:19:05] <zedravan> big flat plane
[3:19:06] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Deleting everything is FREE
[3:19:07] <%crimsonharvest> but if you delete it you'll have to handle the stuff that wont fit in your inventory, so get a personal storage box
[3:19:07] <penitentpendant> The Goblin Nest STIRS
[3:19:07] <+InvertableQuasar> In the big field above the ridge?
[3:19:08] <%sumrand0> quiettNoice
[3:19:08] <%Nested_Dreams> WAIT Until concrete upgrade
[3:19:09] <%viewtifulr> Say Pat how's the game I've been busy so I couldn't any impressions
[3:19:10] <+JustToWatch> this is where the REAL game starts
[3:19:10] <+TipsyND> Wait until you have floors
[3:19:10] <%notsoy> delete and remake at will, 100% efficient scavenging
[3:19:10] <Griffin1171> yup over the ridge
[3:19:11] <AXL808> Pat is now removing troublemakers in the most EFFICIENT manner possible. He's totally in his element now
[3:19:11] <Zaphire_Saucypants> it actually seems like a good idea, yeah do it.
[3:19:12] <Psyramics> why delete it ? leave it up while you build the new ne
[3:19:12] <EuropanLamprey> ! GOBLINS ARE ATTACKING !
[3:19:13] <CureMode_> do it
[3:19:13] <%scallycap> oh jesus christ why is pat so crisp?
[3:19:14] <%teamattack13> ya guys
[3:19:18] <sailercartridge> start over after you unlock foundations
[3:19:20] <+FoolsArcade> foolsaGoblinpog I don't have your Goblin emote but I have MY goblin emote! haha!
[3:19:20] <+MisterAvry> That's what I love about these games. I can stop playing them for a bit and they just get better
[3:19:25] <$SGrim> @PatStaresAt just flatten the whole planet with steel platforms
[3:19:29] <%Jekado> yeah you want the foundations
[3:19:30] <heartlesshealer> yeah, start over after concrete
[3:19:30] <%dj_xo98> Where you landed?
[3:19:31] <NitronStreams> YEAH FLOP IT!
[3:19:32] <triggersqueeze1985> Where are those fucking monkeys i mean arrachinds
[3:19:32] <Griffin1171> SPAGHET
[3:19:32] <+HitchhikingThrough> @scallycap he adjusted his rez from 480p to 1080p
[3:19:34] <Tuna_Can_0> first you build baby base. then use baby base to build big base
[3:19:36] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> That guy was right, wait for foundations
[3:19:38] <%Jekado> you can delete the hub and remake it
[3:19:39] <%darklordfodder> Oh....storage containers connect to conveyor belts...
[3:19:42] <+D00msDayDan> you can dismantle the hub just fine and anything left in the chest or biomass burners go to your inventory or drop to the ground
[3:19:42] <%teamattack13> ya guys. I fucking loved the best friends. but that's shits over now. let's move on.
[3:19:44] <%BoxNavy> @scallycap his camera was set to 480p ever since he started streaming and he only realized it today
[3:19:44] <%takotoots> whoa
[3:19:45] <Final_Cosplay_Corps> foundation smooth all
[3:19:45] <Sunstalker> scallycap Because Pat discovered his camera was on default 480p for years
[3:19:46] <%MistyMntns> This factory is not satisfactory
[3:19:47] <%Ranryu692> @scallycap he realized that his camera had been set to 480p for 4 years,  now it's at 1080
[3:19:47] <%Wurmspawn> Dismantling the hud doesn't lose you any progress. It just turns into a box that you can take and put somewhere else. Just FYI.
[3:19:48] <+Shackle_Rustyford> pat no
[3:19:48] <NoCreditClear> Satisfactory is an idle game with more steps.
[3:19:48] <CrematedCube> My internet had a hiccup, how goes industr- AW YEAH STORAGE
[3:19:49] <+Shackle_Rustyford> oh god
[3:19:49] <%crimsonharvest> climb up
[3:19:50] <%Jekado> there is fall damage
[3:19:51] <%darklordfodder> Like the loader mods for Factorio
[3:19:52] <xbb1024> you need some distance for the conveyor to elevate
[3:19:54] <%notsoy> LMAO 3?!
[3:19:54] <+MisterAvry> let the man spaghet, this is how learning happens
[3:19:56] <%holydeviant1> I love the ladders on the stacking crates
[3:19:58] <%crimsonharvest> climb the ladders up the storage tower get a look at the land
[3:19:58] <+Shackle_Rustyford> this factory is giving me anxiety
[3:20:01] <%DappercatEsquire> convert some of those shipping containers into shitty houses with bad acoustics/heating
[3:20:01] <gryffinp> he managed to use exactly 100% of his iron plates
[3:20:11] <%holydeviant1> Spaghet is best aesthetic
[3:20:16] <%MistyMntns> Omg Please make a miner to shove the iron into that
[3:20:19] <RamenRiderZ> TOWER OF BABEL
[3:20:23] <+queaks> 24 squares
[3:20:23] <boogaleeboo> Yep
[3:20:27] <%holydeviant1> If it doesn't look like the mail sorting room from Looney Toons, it's not right
[3:20:28] <sendart> need to get those miners up man, start draining this planet dry
[3:20:29] <+MisterAvry> I love italian food
[3:20:32] <gryffinp> And yet, not enough
[3:20:37] <$payatanharkonnen> Noooo the hubris is going to destroy him
[3:20:41] <%darklordfodder> lol my sweet summer child
[3:20:44] <+ReallyBigRocks> It's not as much as it seems lol
[3:20:46] <jimbop444> how then will u mock god pat?
[3:20:47] <NitronStreams> only need 1... for now
[3:20:47] <blue8moon> I went to lie down for a bit and there's so many more buildings
[3:20:48] <+JobbedBone> network of conveyors PogChamp
[3:20:48] <%Dunmarkh> you'd think that wouldn't you?
[3:20:49] <Final_Cosplay_Corps> no grass only foundations
[3:20:52] <Zaphire_Saucypants> man the potential scope of this seems pretty goddamn big.
[3:20:53] <%notsoy> no you should still make two
[3:20:53] <+MisterAvry> nice
[3:20:56] <+thegalvanicpanic> when can you make storage containers that can be held inside storage containers?
[3:20:57] <+silentblast93> pat you will get better ons along the wat
[3:20:58] <+queaks> Plates go in
[3:21:00] <%notsoy> so you can feed both conveyers into the two
[3:21:02] <triggersqueeze1985> LUL
[3:21:04] <+HitchhikingThrough> how to merge conveyor
[3:21:09] <+MisterAvry> plates go brrr
[3:21:14] <Griffin1171> splitter
[3:21:14] <+SocialMisfitGamer> BEFORE you decide to move, make sure you know where all of your ore deposits are located.
[3:21:14] <%Cybercobra2> you need a later tech to combine belts @PatStaresAt
[3:21:15] <+queaks> You cant yet
[3:21:16] <xbb1024> you need a merger
[3:21:18] <%nick__sayre> nick__sayre subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 28 months, currently on a 26 month streak! Wow, just over two years! Keep it up man, doin good shit! By the way, pro tip: those platforms you can build can be used to make a floor to let your buildings snap to a grid, dunno if anyone’s mentioned that yet.
[3:21:19] <%MistyMntns> Its an upgrade
[3:21:19] <%crimsonharvest> you need a merger later in logistics
[3:21:21] <%MistyMntns> Later in the game
[3:21:21] <gryffinp> @HitchhikingThrough tier 1 milestone three I believe
[3:21:22] <Griffin1171> later tech
[3:21:22] <%holydeviant1> Later crates have two
[3:21:23] <+Ricmeister> not yet
[3:21:26] <%DorianCreed> You van't yet
[3:21:27] <RzdAkira> You get merger later
[3:21:27] <NoCreditClear> @Zaphire_Saucypants Look up the "Let's Game It Out" satisfactory LP
[3:21:27] <EvanDude47> belt combiner later
[3:21:32] <penitentpendant> "Research Required"
[3:21:33] <%holydeviant1> TIME FOR POLES
[3:21:36] <+TheBobulus> there are mergers, but mixing your items is a bad idea anyway
[3:21:40] <%IncredibleMeh> you don't want to mix storage Pat that's a bad idea
[3:21:42] <Final_Cosplay_Corps> merge
[3:21:44] <%TheWinged7> the ability to delete and get the resources back is the best part
[3:21:49] <triggersqueeze1985> Where’s Elmo??
[3:21:51] <Veluren> Sometimes you have to build the belts halfway because the auto gen is a little derpy
[3:21:52] <Sunstalker> It's been 3 hours, why hasn't the inivisible hand of the market turned this into hyper capitlisme yet? kinamaMad
[3:21:52] <Griffin1171> also DON'T MIX BELTS, IT'S MESSY
[3:21:56] <%holydeviant1> poles will help you route it
[3:22:07] <NoCreditClear> lossless refunds is the greatest feature
[3:22:09] <%crimsonharvest> you need the Mark 1 miners bro
[3:22:10] <+HostileNitrile> Pat when you have the F open you can middle click a building or structure to "sample" that to build without going into build menu
[3:22:16] <%holydeviant1> @Veluren That's what poles are for
[3:22:16] <LVL1_Scumbag> You must construct additional pylons
[3:22:16] <+queaks> When you have the conveyor tool out you can use middle mouse wheel to rotate the conveyor pole
[3:22:21] <T_Sasquatch> @triggersqueeze1985 inside zangief
[3:22:24] <%bevyrage> i'm appreciating that pat's OCD is making him stack storage containers instead of placing them haphazardly
[3:22:27] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Belt mixing is big leagues logistics.
[3:22:28] <+silentblast93> pat for now containor to smelter
[3:22:28] <+JobbedBone> can you delete a storage thing while it has stuff in it and get the stuff back?
[3:22:37] <%holydeviant1> yep
[3:22:38] <iosephe> Goblin time
[3:22:53] <+MisterAvry> not bad
[3:22:54] <triggersqueeze1985> That’s why he conjured up a shitstrom
[3:22:55] <gryffinp> @JobbedBone yes, and if you can't fit it all in your inventory the excess drops to the ground in a little temporary box
[3:22:56] <+MisterAvry> I like it
[3:22:59] <%takotoots> yeyeyeye
[3:23:00] <CrematedCube> Yes, if your inventory is full it drops a chest for you
[3:23:00] <NoCreditClear> @JobbedBone yes. if you run out of inventory it'll appear in a tiny crate on the floor
[3:23:01] <penitentpendant> @Sunstalker There's only one person present, capitalism intrinsically needs more than one person to cause  inequalities to encourage trade
[3:23:07] <+TheBobulus> if you don't like double-click to move items, shift-click also works
[3:23:11] <Griffin1171> set the recipe
[3:23:20] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Middle click with build tool on a building is clone. This will save you  hours of opening the building menu.
[3:23:22] <+JobbedBone> oh this is so dope everything is seamless BibleThump
[3:23:22] <Griffin1171> green is plugged in
[3:23:28] <+HitchhikingThrough> set the recipe again I think
[3:23:29] <moosemonkey397> needs recipe
[3:23:30] <+ReallyBigRocks> it's not working
[3:23:36] <%bevyrage> pat set the recipe
[3:23:36] <+queaks> Pat you need to set the copper constructor
[3:23:40] <RzdAkira> you forgot to set the recipe
[3:23:41] <zedravan> no recepeh
[3:23:45] <+SocialMisfitGamer> Use your mini miners on the iron ore and connect it to the smelter
[3:23:45] <+MisterAvry> @Spudnacious_Dynasty Neat, like the eyedropper tool?
[3:23:46] <+ReallyBigRocks> nope not wire
[3:23:52] <+Shackle_Rustyford> has pat built a miner yet
[3:24:06] <+queaks> @PatStaresAt Set the next milestone so you have clear goals
[3:24:09] <CrimsonFox777> Yay! Automation!
[3:24:10] <Griffin1171> make a miner
[3:24:10] <+MisterAvry> sur de cable
[3:24:15] <%notsoy> he should be making a miner soon
[3:24:21] <+ReallyBigRocks> now time for miner
[3:24:37] <%shurtal> shurtal subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months! One year! Have fun exploiting the ecosystem and stripping it of all it's natural reasources!
[3:24:40] <NitronStreams> now you just need to make the miners and youll have the whole pipeline automated
[3:24:40] <+ReallyBigRocks> god the todo list is such a nice feature
[3:24:46] <%AimlessStranger> What are the odds of you doin' Subnautica as a shitstorm stream this year?
[3:25:00] <+queaks> You can hold space bar if you want
[3:25:00] <+HitchhikingThrough> for now..
[3:25:09] <gryffinp> Does he even have five resource nodes scouted
[3:25:10] <%DiscoMatador> The easiest FOR NOW
[3:25:15] <%Monkeyweed21> but are the smelters in the right position for the miners?
[3:25:16] <%crimsonharvest> fuck dont remind me of subnautica i really fucked it up
[3:25:21] <+HitmanBillson> the biggest time saver for this game is to automate all base materials in the game as soon as possible
[3:25:23] <%MistyMntns> You will overheat
[3:25:24] <NoCreditClear> He's got so many raw minerals sitting around he honestly doesn't need a miner for a big until he clears out some inventory space
[3:25:26] <+MKUltima> Is the latest satisfactory patch out?
[3:25:33] <+HitmanBillson> just so you dont have to do that often
[3:25:37] <+queaks> Not til the 16th
[3:25:44] <Griffin1171> use sort
[3:25:45] <Sunstalker> Wait lil longer and get the frozen biome for subnautica
[3:25:47] <+MKUltima> Aah
[3:25:47] <+ReallyBigRocks> You have 2 iron nodes
[3:25:50] <$ZeOrbling> is the new patch the fluids?
[3:25:54] <gahmah> Play factorio
[3:25:59] <+queaks> And thats only on experimental. It will likely be out on main 2 weeks after that
[3:26:05] <+SocialMisfitGamer> did you just split and combine again
[3:26:07] <+ReallyBigRocks> yuh
[3:26:09] <%Broand> Yeah
[3:26:10] <Griffin1171> make sure to use sort
[3:26:15] <%Broand> it's like that circle shape
[3:26:16] <+MisterAvry> he did
[3:26:16] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> yes
[3:26:18] <%crimsonharvest> yeah each round-ish plate of metal is one nde
[3:26:19] <+MisterAvry> I seent it
[3:26:19] <%Wurmspawn> Hold shift when clicking and things will autotransfer between inventory and container.
[3:26:26] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> I think hold right click (maybe left) on a stack brings up a division slider.
[3:26:27] <+SocialMisfitGamer> Jesus, Pat
[3:26:32] <CrematedCube> The radar marks the two spots exactly
[3:26:35] <+queaks> fyi they need power
[3:26:36] <%QueequegTheater> Pat you can do it, I believe in you
[3:26:37] <%DiscoMatador> Each round thing counts
[3:26:39] <+MisterAvry> I have to agree
[3:26:48] <%crimsonharvest> i can hear the orb getting engorged
[3:26:51] <+ReallyBigRocks> The real Industry Souls starts now
[3:26:54] <+MisterAvry> it's hot
[3:27:01] <%QueequegTheater> HE'S BEGINNING TO BELIEVE
[3:27:01] <+HitchhikingThrough> need power
[3:27:05] <tanklets> Poifect
[3:27:06] <$Afterman_> Pat got big on screen
[3:27:06] <+MisterAvry> slower you slut!
[3:27:08] <%Ebonyglow> waifu alert
[3:27:08] <xbb1024> yeah, baby!
[3:27:09] <+queaks> Need powah
[3:27:11] <%MistyMntns> psaSmug
[3:27:13] <%Dunmarkh> NEED MORE POWER
[3:27:13] <boogaleeboo> You are going to have to build another pole
[3:27:15] <%Monkeyweed21> lol forgot about power
[3:27:15] <+silentblast93> pat you only need 1 per resorce node for now
[3:27:15] <%Broand> Power is needed
[3:27:18] <triggersqueeze1985> Cricket!
[3:27:18] <%DorianCreed> MORE POLES
[3:27:18] <AXL808> too HOT for twitch, going to get banned
[3:27:19] <%DiscoMatador> New pole
[3:27:20] <%shurtal> you can SEE pat's boner grow in real time
[3:27:22] <%DappercatEsquire> gotta get that vespene gas
[3:27:28] <%notsoy> I NEED MORE POWER
[3:27:28] <%walternatorz> "We'll do it LIVE"
[3:27:29] <%Bearded_mushrum> see ya later chat/pat gotta go take a test <3
[3:27:32] <triggersqueeze1985> Crikey!!! Dammit
[3:27:34] <T_Sasquatch> FEED IT Kreygasm
[3:27:42] <+queaks> Best part is once a thing is automated it can litterally leave your brain @PatStaresAt
[3:27:44] <+MisterAvry> is this what it was like to be a robber baron?
[3:27:46] <%DappercatEsquire> @Bearded_mushrum good luck
[3:27:52] <Griffin1171> you won't have enough plates to belt it
[3:27:56] <zedravan> oh the boner is  poking out of the orb Kappa
[3:27:57] <%orphan_ash> psaHoldon psaHoldon
[3:27:57] <gryffinp> Gonna need to run a power line all the way over there
[3:27:58] <%crimsonharvest> now you can get some good use from the belt poles
[3:28:09] <AXL808> is this procedurally generated or no?
[3:28:11] <%Bearded_mushrum> @DappercatEsquire thanks jimmy ill do my best
[3:28:19] <+HitchhikingThrough> going to need those belt poles
[3:28:20] <+silentblast93> oh your where my base is
[3:28:21] <%Dunmarkh> that's pretty reasonable fall damage
[3:28:27] <%CommanderSqueaks> Cock it off, eh?
[3:28:30] <%Cybercobra2> @AXL808 no, its a premade map
[3:28:31] <%crimsonharvest> @AXL808 no
[3:28:35] <NoCreditClear> @AXL808 No. One consistent map.
[3:28:44] <%Broand> @Dunmarkh There's some serious drops in this game
[3:28:47] <+silentblast93> btw pat theis map is not randomly generated
[3:28:51] <%QueequegTheater> Just switch to Armorer
[3:28:55] <+HitchhikingThrough> power the iron plate maker first I think
[3:28:56] <%DiscoMatador> There is nothing that is TOO MUCH For the BELTS PAT
[3:29:00] <+MisterAvry> power the miner?
[3:29:02] <+MisterAvry> is it powered?
[3:29:08] <huskarl_zap> oh fuck mandalor is on
[3:29:10] <%DappercatEsquire> @PatStaresAt is this like optimizing ziplines in Death Stranding times ten?
[3:29:12] <moosemonkey397> YEYEYE POWER SPAGHET
[3:29:13] <%DiscoMatador> THE BELTS ARE ETERNAL
[3:29:17] <%Broand> Hey pat did you know that the other starting locations also on this same map and if you go jogging you can find them
[3:29:22] <%holydeviant1> Remember: Always save a power slot. :3
[3:29:25] <+queaks> Build like 6 poles right next to each other right by your power output. It helps
[3:29:34] <NoCreditClear> Belts are love, belts are life
[3:29:36] <+queaks> out of leaves@
[3:29:37] <moosemonkey397> refill leaves
[3:29:39] <sendart> FUEL
[3:29:39] <+HitchhikingThrough> check biomass maybe?
[3:29:40] <Veluren> Fuel?
[3:29:41] <+OwlLightningMage> I just watched the trailer for this game. My brain melted LUL
[3:29:42] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Biomass is out
[3:29:43] <%CommanderSqueaks> No power.
[3:29:44] <zedravan> burner run out?
[3:29:44] <%Cybercobra2> did you go over your limit?
[3:29:45] <Griffin1171> generator
[3:29:46] <boogaleeboo> Leaf run
[3:29:47] <%bevyrage> no biomass

[3:29:48] <%BoxNavy> leafs
[3:29:51] <+queaks> Out of feeble organic matter
[3:29:52] <%notsoy> fuel?
[3:29:52] <+SocialMisfitGamer> Cut the poles and start again
[3:29:52] <%CommanderSqueaks> Check your generator
[3:29:54] <+MisterAvry> someone said leaves
[3:29:54] <xbb1024> can you build extra burners yet?
[3:29:54] <$ZeOrbling> out of power?
[3:29:55] <jimbop444> is this just a game to make people with OCD happy, is there a goal or like keep building?
[3:29:55] <AXL808> if it's just one premade map, then isn't there a mathematically PERFECT way for Pat to design this place?
[3:29:56] <+silentblast93> go to the geneator
[3:29:59] <triggersqueeze1985> Spank power unlocked
[3:29:59] <$Trenr> everything's stopped

[3:30:45] <Veluren> Ohp, you tripped the grid, too much power usage on one generator
[3:30:47] <boogaleeboo> you need another burner
[3:30:54] <%Broand> This is the big issue with early game power
[3:30:54] <tanklets> Need them leafy greens
[3:30:56] <%holydeviant1> Your generators can only output so much
[3:30:58] <%DappercatEsquire> you're texas now
[3:31:00] <gryffinp> that won't hold for long
[3:31:02] <CrematedCube> Both need to run to meet the demand

[3:31:04] <%holydeviant1> You need to slap more into the network
[3:31:07] <heartlesshealer> 5 petal
[3:31:08] <%Broand> You can pick those yellow flowers if you want
[3:31:11] <%notsoy> check your storage for more stuff
[3:31:12] <+queaks> Gonna run out of fuel soon
[3:31:17] <$Trenr> power go down
[3:31:18] <%Jekado> gotta rush to coal
[3:31:18] <gryffinp> it was warming up
[3:31:19] <%DorianCreed> 5 petal, 12 leaf
[3:31:20] <+BusterRepukken> you need fuel for the gens
[3:31:21] <%CommanderSqueaks> Need more burners
[3:31:22] <heartlesshealer> time to forage

[3:31:24] <%holydeviant1> MORE GENERATORS OR YOU'LL KEEP LOSING POWER
[3:31:25] <%Jekado> because you used up the fuel
[3:31:26] <+MisterAvry> beeewwww
[3:31:27] <%bevyrage> you put in petals and leaves
[3:31:28] <xbb1024> you're tripping the fuze
[3:31:29] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Rush coal
[3:31:29] <sendart> need a fuckton more leaves
[3:31:30] <+queaks> Time to collect leaves like a mad man
[3:31:31] <Sunstalker> Feed your son(s) kinamaHappyW
[3:31:31] <%bevyrage> you need WOOD
[3:31:32] <+InvertableQuasar> You put like 5 flower petals in the second generator
[3:31:34] <Griffin1171> forage for fuel
[3:31:35] <RzdAkira> Generator died again
[3:31:36] <%DorianCreed> Fuel again
[3:31:37] <Veluren> You have too much on one power grid, it's causing brownouts
[3:31:39] <%Nested_Dreams> Machines need to spool up to work, so drills are not instant
[3:31:40] <%BoxNavy> i think wood burns slower?
[3:31:41] <%CommanderSqueaks> "You must construct additional  pylons."
[3:31:41] <%holydeviant1> NOT JUST FUEL, MORE BURNERS
[3:31:41] <%Broand> He can't make more generators yet
[3:31:43] <tanklets> Least leaves are everywhere
[3:31:43] <+MisterAvry> takes more leaves than that to run a campfire
[3:31:44] <%notsoy> CHECK STORAGE
[3:31:46] <sendart> strip the planet bare!
[3:31:46] <+D00msDayDan> B I O M A S S
[3:31:50] <BoneofMalkav> ALL the leaves!
[3:31:52] <%Monkeyweed21> need to upgrade to wood
[3:31:52] <NitronStreams> Vergil would hate this game
[3:31:52] <%QueequegTheater> Pat Stares At Fracking
[3:31:57] <%holydeviant1> Ohwell,
[3:31:59] <jimbop444> green energy lol
[3:32:05] <$ZeOrbling> have you tried attacking those walking whales to see what you get?
[3:32:08] <gryffinp> @QueequegTheater fracking's in the next update
[3:32:09] <+queaks> Coal power is on the horizon
[3:32:11] <%holydeviant1> need to hit the level that gets you generators
[3:32:13] <%TheWinged7> you can burn wood
[3:32:13] <moosemonkey397> coal comes eventually. delicious fossil fuels
[3:32:14] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> need more Vasepen Gas
[3:32:17] <boogaleeboo> Yeah, getting power upgrades is the real FUCK YOU PLANET NOW I'M COMING FOR YOU moment
[3:32:18] <tanklets> The whales are immortal
[3:32:21] <+D00msDayDan> now that you mention it i wonder if you can stick coal in a biomass burner
[3:32:25] <%Broand> Look on that tree over there
[3:32:25] <%CommanderSqueaks> Does this game have permadeath?
[3:32:30] <heartlesshealer> just grab wood with your fist
[3:32:36] <boogaleeboo> nope
[3:32:38] <CappuccinoGuil> @D00msDayDan no, you need a coal burner
[3:32:41] <heartlesshealer> yank it out of those plants wholesale
[3:32:44] <%notsoy> you probably have some stuff in storage, i think that's what the number in parantheses means
[3:32:45] <gryffinp> @CommanderSqueaks no, you respawn in the hub and your stuff drops at your corpse
[3:32:48] <+queaks> Other power meathods dont need to be micro managed. youll get there
[3:32:50] <CrematedCube> There is coal to burn but it's not easy to run across
[3:32:54] <NoCreditClear> Next milestone you unlock more efficient biomass
[3:33:07] <Pt_Kamen> get Sundowner's theme going

[3:34:02] <EvanDude47> you should probably check what the next milestone is though
[3:34:02] <+MisterAvry> it's like creating and then untangling a giant ball of xmas lights
[3:34:03] <gryffinp> oh yeah, it's all coming together
[3:34:05] <blue8moon> PogChamp PogChamp
[3:34:08] <NitronStreams> ITS ALIIIIVE!!!

[3:34:27] <%holydeviant1> >Why do all our employees keep acting like mad scientists?  >Dunno, but productivity is way up
[3:34:29] <%Jekado> this game is basically 10 hours of frustration for 30 mins of success REPEAT

[3:34:42] <%DamnFineCupofStreaming> doodSprinkle doodSprinkle doodSprinkle Unlimited Power doodSprinkle doodSprinkle doodSprinkle
[3:34:42] <+queaks> Sounds about right
[3:34:44] <NitronStreams> TO THE MOOOOOOOON
[3:34:45] <%TheWinged7> @PatStaresAt welcome to the high of my work, software automation has the same kicks when it works
[3:34:48] <tanklets> Gonna need to automate some concrete soon
[3:34:49] <%hamborgini> I won't be satisfactoried until pat makes that space elevator
[3:34:51] <%Broand> You HAVE TO MAKE THE SPACE ELEVATOR
[3:34:53] <%holydeviant1> (Space elevator is MORE TIERS)
[3:34:59] <+ccwettr123> @YakumoYomi always were
[3:35:05] <%Emperor_Machinus> Or how Paige would call it night time elevator
[3:35:06] <+Javaa01> @Jekado Pat plays MMOs, so that's perfectly up his alley
[3:35:09] <Megalofyte> pat if you fucking quit before you build the space elevator
[3:35:11] <+MisterAvry> Yeah that elevator is gonna be your friend
[3:35:12] <+queaks> Pat you have 300 wire
[3:35:19] <+MisterAvry> or enemy
[3:35:24] <%YakumoYomi> My God...NotLikeThis
[3:35:26] <CrematedCube> The elevator is your automation endpoint, where everything is funneled
[3:35:29] <CappuccinoGuil> 5 km long conveyor belts, hell yeah
[3:35:31] <%bevyrage> you can also terraform can't you?
[3:35:31] <%kullumanati> Staying for Pat. This is boring af.
[3:35:31] <%Broand> Spaghetti time
[3:35:31] <%walternatorz> oh, pat's building the hellbelt?
[3:35:33] <+MisterAvry> depending on your mood
[3:35:33] <Final_Cosplay_Corps> bets on space elevator done tonight?
[3:35:38] <%holydeviant1> I don't think he'll hit the elevator, considering he's got like less than half an hour
[3:35:44] <boogaleeboo> you need the connector
[3:35:44] <sendart> going to need to build it in stages
[3:35:44] <NitronStreams> dont forget youll also need to run powerlines
[3:35:52] <CappuccinoGuil> Click again
[3:35:58] <+JobbedBone> Is Clerks an inditement of a certain kind of late 20s early 30s person, or more general?
[3:36:03] <%Spydurman> @PatStaresAt if you ever need a couple of quick materials you can take them straight off the conveyor belt
[3:36:05] <+queaks> Oh yeah. Spaghetti time
[3:36:06] <tanklets> Mouse up and down to make the pole taller
[3:36:07] <%Broand> Use scroll wheel too
[3:36:15] <heartlesshealer> Uuuuuh
[3:36:20] <+MisterAvry> it's like Death Stranding truckin, but you make "traffic"
[3:36:20] <gryffinp> notice the casual ease with which the conveyor belt goes through trees and indeed stone
[3:36:27] <%BinaryFireball> ride it
[3:36:29] <%king_wragles> That is bullshit BLAZING
[3:36:30] <+queaks> Now it needs power
[3:36:30] <moosemonkey397> power poles
[3:36:31] <%BinaryFireball> you know you want to
[3:36:33] <CrematedCube> I know the elevator takes tons of wire to make
[3:36:33] <%holydeviant1> LOOOONG conveyor
[3:36:36] <%QueequegTheater> The chad belt
[3:36:38] <moosemonkey397> feelin good
[3:36:40] <+MisterAvry> doesn't it feel good?
[3:36:40] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Middle mouse wheel adjusts curve of belt endpoint.
[3:36:40] <%bevyrage> might as well build a solar power array out near the two miners
[3:36:41] <Griffin1171> POWER THO
[3:36:47] <CappuccinoGuil> LOOONG LOOONG BEEEEELT!
[3:36:50] <moosemonkey397> this style of game is my porn
[3:36:50] <%notsoy> can something disrupt or destroy conveyer belts?
[3:36:59] <%Jekado> nope
[3:36:59] <gryffinp> nope
[3:37:04] <Final_Cosplay_Corps> no
[3:37:12] <blue8moon> should probably grab the leaves as you pass them, you're gonna need a ton of fuel
[3:37:13] <gryffinp> I forget, are conveyor lifts unlocked yet
[3:37:16] <CappuccinoGuil> Hell yeah, bullshit your way up! LUL
[3:37:18] <+MisterAvry> you had a blue there for a sec
[3:37:19] <%GarbageNirvana> You can build it in segments
[3:37:22] <%AimlessStranger> Pats literally going to shove the environment piece by piece in a furnace so he can have a space elevator.
[3:37:23] <CrematedCube> It isn't, aim from above
[3:37:23] <+MisterAvry> somewhere in there
[3:37:28] <%Jekado> doesn't pat have conveyor lifts yet?
[3:37:28] <gryffinp> Apparently not
[3:37:30] <%blastyoboots> need more plates
[3:37:31] <%Jekado> nope...
[3:37:34] <%KeiganOfAstora> @PatStaresAt Back from dinnerhow you likin' it?
[3:37:35] <%QueequegTheater> Skyrim your way up this hill
[3:37:36] <NoCreditClear> After you click once when placing a belt, you can raise the pole
[3:37:38] <%Jekado> bummer
[3:37:41] <xbb1024> They just let you guide your belt easier
[3:37:42] <+ReallyBigRocks> @PatStaresAt Conveyor poles automatically get built under the belt
[3:37:42] <tanklets> Ya know you can slide while running by pressing C. Makes moving a lot quicker
[3:37:44] <moosemonkey397> vertical conveyors arent for a while
[3:37:45] <+MisterAvry> this is where the game becomes kinda Rollercoaster Tycoon
[3:37:47] <CappuccinoGuil> Pat, when you pull a belt from a construction and place it on the ground, it auto-creates a pole. That's why you had to double-click
[3:37:54] <+queaks> You get vertical conveyors eventually
[3:37:59] <%KeiganOfAstora> Having fun?
[3:38:01] <xbb1024> You can just put your constructor down there
[3:38:09] <%Jekado> you can auto raise it too
[3:38:19] <boogaleeboo> IT JUST GOES
[3:38:23] <+MisterAvry> that's an important question: Pat are you having fun?
[3:38:31] <+ReallyBigRocks> ore go brrrr
[3:38:34] <CappuccinoGuil> You can also make tall conveyor poles. Click and move your mouse up
[3:38:38] <+queaks> How fast it spits plates out is why purity matters
[3:38:54] <%holydeviant1> >belts intersecting with geometry nnnnnnnuuuuuu
[3:38:54] <%Jekado> if you click once you can raise it up more if you want more height
[3:38:54] <%GarbageNirvana> Pat is getting all the endorphins
[3:39:06] <gryffinp> it might be easier to make the limestone into concrete down there and then run a belt with the concrete up
[3:39:06] <xbb1024> Clipping is allowed in early access
[3:39:09] <+JobbedBone> LUL
[3:39:10] <+MisterAvry> Clip Clippington
[3:39:13] <+queaks> ignore plants
[3:39:15] <%Jekado> god i hate when the belts clip into the ground
[3:39:21] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Is your wire production backed up?
[3:39:21] <%holydeviant1> Nnnnnnnnnugh
[3:39:21] <CappuccinoGuil> okay, it didn't clip the rock though LUL
[3:39:22] <+queaks> Someone clip this
[3:39:26] <DrkJP520> Get out of the way, nature
[3:39:31] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Ahh, power.
[3:39:37] <+queaks> The irony
[3:39:38] <KShirahama> god i love how blets clip into ground
[3:39:40] <%Jekado> i hate that plants grow back and will grow through concrete bases
[3:39:46] <+OwlLightningMage> A a ron
[3:39:55] <gryffinp> I don't think plants do grow back
[3:40:02] <%octavian_wolf> octavian_wolf subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months! excellent
[3:40:04] <%Jekado> when you get concrete plates it gets better
[3:40:06] <+ReallyBigRocks> how are you supposed to ride on your conveyors if they're all clipping through shit
[3:40:13] <Final_Cosplay_Corps> belt not care geometry
[3:40:14] <%Jekado> no nature just smooth MACHINES
[3:40:15] <+queaks> This game is so chill
[3:40:18] <%Broand> You can pick those flowers at your feet by the by
[3:40:38] <%Jekado> the only non chill part of this game is HD hunting
[3:40:44] <%Jekado> so many harddrives...
[3:40:46] <+queaks> tower
[3:40:48] <+MythosDeity> This game is so slept on. Glad to see Pat enjoying it.
[3:40:49] <DrkJP520> This all seems very exposed. What if a bird flies into the machinery?
[3:40:58] <%blastyoboots> storage go literally UP
[3:41:02] <MayorRev> how's your creativity brain doing?
[3:41:03] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt This is starting to look that that build a stage area in TitanFall 2
[3:41:03] <gryffinp> there's no such thing as birds
[3:41:20] <+HitchhikingThrough> @DrkJP520 then we will grease the wheels with blood
[3:41:21] <+queaks> Now to power everything
[3:41:22] <%Jekado> power
[3:41:23] <blue8moon> through the cable LUL
[3:41:25] <%Jekado> you need power
[3:41:29] <%Broand> You need a LOT of concrete in this game
[3:41:29] <%holydeviant1> THE RESOURCE TOWER
[3:41:31] <+ReallyBigRocks> @PatStaresAt All the buildings have ladders on them that work btw
[3:41:33] <%blastyoboots> @DrkJP520 Biomass for the generators!
[3:41:36] <%Broand> so getting that made it important
[3:41:40] <+JobbedBone> the crafting will continue until efficiency improves jermaSun
[3:41:44] <%Monkeyweed21> eww the cables are clipping
[3:41:45] <Profmcstevie> I see Pat is enjoying the smell of the game....the smell of INDUSTRIAL PROGRESS
[3:41:54] <%holydeviant1> You are gonna want more biomass burners ASAP
[3:41:55] <%blastyoboots> @ReallyBigRocks ALL THE BUILDINGS have working LADDERS?! that's the best!!!
[3:42:02] <+queaks> @PatStaresAt The powerlines will create power poles similar to how the conveyors work
[3:42:05] <%GarbageNirvana> Is this how we got capitalism
[3:42:05] <%QueequegTheater> WHAT IS THAT THING
[3:42:06] <+MisterAvry> tendrils!
[3:42:10] <+TTVPun> Oh shit, time for comfy factories? cirComfy
[3:42:12] <%asgard147> Does it feel good pat? limesPat
[3:42:14] <%holydeviant1> @blastyoboots AND THE STACKABLE CRATES HAVE THEM ALIGNED
[3:42:17] <gryffinp> which thing
[3:42:19] <heartlesshealer> Yeet that copper wire!
[3:42:30] <gryffinp> oh that thing
[3:42:32] <%notsoy> are there limits on power line length?
[3:42:36] <gryffinp> that's a jim
[3:42:37] <RzdAkira> I love how resources just fly out of your pocket to build the things
[3:42:37] <jcflyguy> Man I wish this was on console
[3:42:41] <+ReallyBigRocks> @blastyoboots Most have platforms on the top too, it's great for getting an overview of your building
[3:42:49] <+queaks> This doesnt seem osha
[3:42:50] <MayorRev> just got here, describe the basic loop of this?
[3:42:52] <heartlesshealer> he's going mad with power poles
[3:42:53] <moosemonkey397> YAY!
[3:42:55] <%QueequegTheater> Kreygasm
[3:42:55] <+JobbedBone> @PatStaresAt now design it so none of the cables cross :)
[3:42:55] <+MisterAvry> power go down
[3:42:55] <gryffinp> oh no the bad sound
[3:42:55] <+HitchhikingThrough> makes sense
[3:42:55] <%Jekado> theres that sound
[3:42:57] <moosemonkey397> XD
[3:42:57] <rasmus206060> LUL
[3:42:58] <+TTVPun> overloaded the system cirLaugh
[3:42:58] <%holydeviant1> aand the breaker goes.
[3:42:59] <NitronStreams> Oh god the spiders web of powerlines
[3:43:00] <iosephe> oops
[3:43:01] <%asgard147> limesLUL
[3:43:01] <%Cybercobra2> i think you just went over your power budget
[3:43:07] <+HitchhikingThrough> that sound rules
[3:43:08] <%Jekado> one of your generators doesn't have any biomass in it
[3:43:08] <sendart> one of your burners is off
[3:43:11] <%notsoy> refill? or budget limit
[3:43:12] <+TheMorilo> look at this favela wiring system
[3:43:13] <+mcburgers3000> This game is breaking my engineering brain...
[3:43:14] <heartlesshealer> I like how the noise happened riiiiight when he connected <3
[3:43:15] <+queaks> The system.... is down
[3:43:15] <+OwlLightningMage> Need more power
[3:43:28] <BoxNavy> i hate it
[3:43:31] <EvanDude47> you should shut down some unneeded stuff until you reach the milestone and can bang out bigger power juice
[3:43:34] <%blastyoboots> clipping early access
[3:43:36] <boogaleeboo> Nothing can stop the machine of capitalism
[3:43:38] <%Jekado> yeah... just... clips right through...
[3:43:39] <gryffinp> physics in this game are imaginary
[3:43:40] <%Cybercobra2> game says: if you dont care about clipping, then i dont care
[3:43:41] <KShirahama> i love it
[3:43:42] <+OwlLightningMage> You are the storm that is approaching
[3:43:46] <+InvertableQuasar> Do you have any biomass in storage?
[3:43:47] <NitronStreams> Clipping like a REAL ASS videogame!
[3:43:48] <+queaks> Fuse
[3:43:52] <jimbop444> I'm seeing a few osha violations
[3:43:52] <TurtlesAndTentacles> If Gamera comes out of the ground to attack Pat's factory I will laugh
[3:43:53] <%notsoy> do you make armor later at some point or something?
[3:43:57] <+queaks> Fuse pat
[3:43:58] <gryffinp> you can build something supported by other structures, delete the support, and leave it hanging in the air, heedless of mortal "gravity"
[3:44:00] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> hit the lever!
[3:44:02] <%hamborgini> your power grid is overloaded with too much stuff running at once
[3:44:12] <%flechet> pat it'll auto place power poles when stringing power wires if you don't select a device
[3:44:16] <+queaks> I love that heavy toggle you have to pull. Its chunky
[3:44:23] <%asgard147> limesYay
[3:44:43] <$ZeOrbling> autofill the gap
[3:44:44] <gryffinp> make sure to grab some copper wire before you turn it all into cable
[3:44:45] <+ReallyBigRocks> @PatStaresAt like with the conveyor belts
[3:44:47] <moosemonkey397> like conveyors if you go too far
[3:44:48] <+InvertableQuasar> Start a wire on a pole and then just click on the ground
[3:44:49] <%QueequegTheater> It means it will auto place power poles when stringing power wires if you don't select a device
[3:44:49] <CappuccinoGuil> Click on a power pole to make a cable and drag, you'll see
[3:44:49] <EvanDude47> you didn't have to set up poles before cabling
[3:44:50] <Darthkitten_Prime> He's doing that thing again where he forgets to breathe.
[3:44:53] <%blastyoboots> @PatStaresAt It means you don't need to manually place any power poles
[3:44:54] <%Broand> click wire, click thing, click ground
[3:44:55] <Profmcstevie> It'll do it itself if it has nothing to go to
[3:44:56] <%sumrand0> Aside from the obvious "number go up" aspect I realize that this game is perfect for Pat: inventory management is something we know he appreciates & pollution is just industrial littering so OBVIOUSLY this game is perfect for him!
[3:44:57] <+MisterAvry> like you do for belts? Like you can just click on bare ground with wire tool?
[3:44:59] <%Monkeyweed21> it works the same as the conveyor belts
[3:45:00] <%tank7013> If you point at the ground instead of a structure it'll be a pole
[3:45:00] <gryffinp> fair enough
[3:45:05] <%flechet> yep
[3:45:15] <moosemonkey397> yupyup
[3:45:15] <+HitchhikingThrough> YUP
[3:45:17] <%Broand> hahaahhaha
[3:45:19] <+MisterAvry> your words
[3:45:19] <%Ranryu692> LUL
[3:45:20] <gryffinp> OH yeah, this is all getting torn apart
[3:45:21] <+HitchhikingThrough> Do it all again
[3:45:21] <Profmcstevie> "It just works" the video game
[3:45:21] <gryffinp> but not yet
[3:45:22] <%Broand> not even close to an abomination
[3:45:23] <%AzureGale> We're building it up to break it back down~
[3:45:24] <CappuccinoGuil> Pat, finish your milestone first, TRUST US
[3:45:24] <+TheMorilo> it's horrible
[3:45:25] <heartlesshealer> LUL
[3:45:26] <+queaks> Promise nothing. Deliver less
[3:45:27] <+JobbedBone> @PatStaresAt design it so none of the cables cross BibleThump
[3:45:27] <%Wurmspawn> WELCOME to SATISFACTORY!
[3:45:27] <EvanDude47> this is the biggest osha violation
[3:45:30] <RzdAkira> Finall yhe said the thing
[3:45:30] <CrimsonFox777> You've learned how to do it, now learn to optimize it!
[3:45:31] <zazzera01> wait until you get foundations
[3:45:31] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Pat think of it like littering on an industrial scale
[3:45:31] <+crazyspartan214> LET TEAR THIS MOTHERFUCKER DOWN!!!!
[3:45:33] <+king_of_beggars> It's a mess. Restart the game. New file.
[3:45:35] <KShirahama> yes after foundations
[3:45:36] <+HitchhikingThrough> ITS THE BEST
[3:45:37] <hat_under_bread> You haven't seen the abominations that people have made in Satisfactory.
[3:45:39] <+queaks> Yeah but pat. Its yours
[3:45:40] <EvanDude47> OSHA will destroy you
[3:45:41] <CrematedCube> Once we get foundations we shall rebuild it better
[3:45:42] <+ReallyBigRocks> But IT WORKS tho
[3:45:43] <%blastyoboots> yeah finish milestone first to get better stuff to replace it iwth
[3:45:44] <LVL1_Scumbag> Tear down and optimize
[3:45:44] <moosemonkey397> eat your spaghetti pat
[3:45:45] <sendart> IT PLEASES THE MACHINE GOD
[3:45:46] <+TheMorilo> finish your things first
[3:45:46] <boogaleeboo> Yeah the milestone gets you better power options
[3:45:47] <NitronStreams> Bless this mess
[3:45:48] <%Arkfyre> spaghetti is part of the fun
[3:45:48] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Pat we like it tho
[3:45:50] <heartlesshealer> It will happen forever <3
[3:45:52] <%holydeviant1> It's a horrible borg-lite monster of industry
[3:45:53] <+TheCrispyBoi> but hey, it works
[3:45:54] <+crazyspartan214> let's White Castle this bitch!
[3:45:55] <%Wurmspawn> You haven't even gotten into OIL refining!
[3:45:56] <+vaderxyz1970> Reminds me of south east asia
[3:45:58] <Profmcstevie> Abominations are the other side to these kind of games.....horrible, awful systems

[3:46:14] <Psyramics> this is barely spaghet
[3:46:18] <%holydeviant1> AHAHAHAHAH there's the sound!
[3:46:20] <+MisterAvry> that was power

[3:46:23] <%QueequegTheater> MORE WOOD
[3:46:24] <CappuccinoGuil> Pat, if you disassemble a structure and you don't have space in your inventory, the leftover mats will drop in a box on the ground.

[3:48:12] <CappuccinoGuil> just finish the milestone LUL
[3:48:13] <+OwlLightningMage> This game would melt my brain
[3:48:13] <%Broand> It gets better but only like way later
[3:48:14] <%Ranryu692> you keep putting in practically no fuel and then are surprised when you run out LUL
[3:48:14] <%cobalt_phoenix_> CONCRETE
[3:48:15] <tanklets> Oh hey quartz
[3:48:16] <Zaphire_Saucypants> the joy you have for this game is so wholesome, Pat.
[3:48:17] <RzdAkira> Biomass burner is a pain without milestone 6 LUL

[3:48:25] <CappuccinoGuil> You can MAKE the lat 41 rods, dude LUL
[3:48:26] <+InvertableQuasar> You need the next milestone, I think you've actually just hit the max output of your generators
[3:48:26] <EuropanLamprey> "Why isn't my factory working?  Oh, I forgot to plug it in"
[3:48:28] <CrematedCube> Pick a forest and sacrifice it on the altar of progress
[3:48:29] <%IncredibleMeh> dont worry pat you'll have so much concrete soon you'll be fucking sick of it
[3:48:29] <+silentblast93> pat you can also ride the convayor belts for more speed
[3:48:31] <%BoxNavy> no
[3:48:31] <+OwlLightningMage> Pat needs more power
[3:48:31] <+silentblast93> no
[3:48:31] <CappuccinoGuil> No
[3:48:32] <moosemonkey397> nah preset map
[3:48:33] <$Trenr> No
[3:48:33] <tanklets> Nope

[3:48:34] <GelatinFellow> Nope
[3:48:34] <%Apathiae> No
[3:48:35] <iosephe> Nope
[3:48:35] <+ReallyBigRocks> Nope it's a set map
[3:48:35] <%tank7013> No
[3:48:35] <%Cybercobra2> no its premade
[3:48:36] <%DEETRz> no
[3:48:36] <xbb1024> no, it's designed
[3:48:37] <+TheMorilo> NO
[3:48:37] <tanklets> 1 map
[3:48:38] <GelatinFellow> All maps pre designed
[3:48:38] <zedravan> nope
[3:48:38] <%Wurmspawn> No.
[3:48:38] <%Nested_Dreams> Biomass will help but is not a solution
[3:48:39] <+Gradi3nt> nope
[3:48:39] <gryffinp> It is NOT, it is a hand-crafted planet.
[3:48:39] <EvanDude47> nope ts 4 leverls
[3:48:39] <Sollidnitro> no
[3:48:41] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Nope.
[3:48:42] <%Broand> The map is 25x25 km or something
[3:48:44] <%BoxNavy> ye
[3:48:45] <RzdAkira> No
[3:48:45] <$Trenr> Correct
[3:48:46] <%Dunmarkh> like subnautica
[3:48:47] <%holydeviant1> In fact, the opening options are all locations on the map
[3:48:50] <tanklets> Theres a dick rock in the sesert
[3:48:50] <CrematedCube> No, it's like Subnautica, pre-made
[3:48:51] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> It's very well built.
[3:48:51] <+silentblast93> your in the same area as amy factory
[3:48:52] <%Cybercobra2> its a massive map too, many biomes
[3:48:52] <CappuccinoGuil> It's a map. The location you chose at the start is which biome you wanna drop in
[3:48:53] <$Trenr> The map is fucking huge
[3:48:55] <%tank7013> The other starts are just different areas on the map
[3:48:56] <+TipsyND> See that mountain? You can climb it.
[3:48:57] <+queaks> I personally love that its hand crafted. Its huge and there are secrets to explore @PatStaresAt
[3:48:57] <%Broand> The starting zones are also on this planet
[3:48:57] <+ReallyBigRocks> @EvanDude47 It's actually one level
[3:48:59] <xbb1024> there are even complete maps on the interwebs
[3:49:00] <+darkmega354> also, all the starting options are just different map locations
[3:49:05] <%Broand> The other ones I mean
[3:49:05] <EvanDude47> ohhhh
[3:49:06] <%GeneralSCPatton> All the options were on the SAME MAP!
[3:49:06] <ContainsSodium> Hi pat
[3:49:07] <EvanDude47> i see!
[3:49:09] <+TheBobulus> one map, four spawn points!
[3:49:10] <%Monkeyweed21> the ligma is always near the starting position
[3:49:14] <RzdAkira> All 4 starting locations are basically in this one map
[3:49:14] <%holydeviant1> Oh man, that power graph
[3:49:16] <%AimlessStranger> neither is ark or subnautica
[3:49:17] <%holydeviant1> it's TRYING
[3:49:19] <Profmcstevie> So how you build is feasible for every other player who'll ever watch play this
[3:49:21] <+MisterAvry> can you hack that tree down?
[3:49:23] <gryffinp> If you keep playing you will spend twenty hours in a one KM radius and then you will leave and go "HOW IS THIS MAP SO VAST YET SO DENSE THIS IS A FACTORY GAME?"
[3:49:23] <%Nested_Dreams> Locations of a collectible might be randomized but that's judging from my set of n=2
[3:49:24] <%Broand> Yellow flowers at your feed dude
[3:49:28] <%BoxNavy> now that you got your shit set up why not go and look for better fuel sources than leaves
[3:49:35] <CappuccinoGuil> @MisterAvry not yet
[3:49:38] <jimbop444> said all the great bastions of industry, I need more leaves
[3:49:42] <+queaks> Its hand crafted meaning there are secrets that contain rare resources
[3:49:43] <+OwlLightningMage> The updog is near the starting point
[3:49:46] <CappuccinoGuil> Maybe you'll get one Kappa
[3:49:47] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Foraging forces you to explore around the hub, which is neat.
[3:49:48] <+ReallyBigRocks> You get a chainsaw eventually
[3:49:49] <+silentblast93> pat go a bit north by north east and there will be more iorn
[3:49:49] <%DianaTheAscian> LUL LUL LUL
[3:49:54] <+TheBobulus> there's a chainsaw
[3:49:54] <xbb1024> a harvester?
[3:49:56] <+TechnicolorNinja> doodLUL
[3:49:58] <%holydeviant1> yOU GET A CHAINSAW~
[3:49:58] <heartlesshealer> pat
[3:49:59] <+MisterAvry> ah, the Rabbit Orphaner 4500
[3:49:59] <+queaks> You might get one... soon even
[3:50:00] <CrematedCube> One word: chainsaw
[3:50:01] <%asgard147> Sounds good limesEvil
[3:50:01] <Tytangamer> GOOD NEWS.
[3:50:06] <+silentblast93> well ther is a chainsaw
[3:50:06] <$Wurmspawn> Closest you get is a handheld chainsaw
[3:50:09] <%darklordfodder> The evolution of these games is interesting. Dwarf Fortress -> Minecraft -> Minecraft tech mods, like Industrial Craft and Build Craft -> Factorio -> Satisfactory and Dyson Sphere Program
[3:50:10] <%YakumoYomi> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[3:50:11] <ContainsSodium> Pat is the bad guys in James Cameron's Avatar
[3:50:12] <%Nested_Dreams> Tier 1 upgrade - equipment will grant your wish
[3:50:12] <heartlesshealer> chainsaw appear
[3:50:15] <+OwlLightningMage> World eater
[3:50:15] <Griffin1171> there's yellow flowers on the ground
[3:50:16] <+darkmega354> chainsaw go brrrr
[3:50:19] <zazzera01> eventually you can feed the local wildlife into your biomass burners
[3:50:19] <%GeneralSCPatton> FORM EARTH INTO CUBE
[3:50:22] <%tank7013> Unfortunately power is pretty rough until you upgrade from bio
[3:50:23] <+FlappySeal_> The Thumper Thumper
[3:50:26] <%Broand> You can pick the yellow flowerts too
[3:50:27] <+king_of_beggars> Task Rabbit, find me someone who can STRIP THE EARTH BARE OF LIFE
[3:50:29] <GunEden> salt the earth
[3:50:36] <boogaleeboo> Listen all I remember about avatar is that guy in the mech suit seemed cool, so go company!
[3:50:40] <gryffinp> don't forget to warframe slidejump
[3:50:41] <%holydeviant1> Imagine how this guy looks from outside, just running around and ripping all the plants out in his wake
[3:50:41] <CappuccinoGuil> Also, for the Chat, this game has co-op
[3:50:44] <+OwlLightningMage> You should be able to judgement cut resources
[3:50:45] <%SilvaChariot0133> It's fiiiine
[3:50:47] <+MisterAvry> but it's YOUR shitmess
[3:50:48] <Zaphire_Saucypants> We must recreate Toxic Love from Fern Gully
[3:50:50] <sendart> its so beautiful
[3:50:50] <heartlesshealer> it's the best
[3:50:52] <Griffin1171> but it's your shitmess
[3:50:52] <NitronStreams> this is beautiful
[3:50:55] <+MisterAvry> be proud
[3:50:56] <%YakumoYomi> @FlappySeal_ That's good. REAL good.
[3:51:03] <+JobbedBone> a factory so big that future generations have to build a memorial where it used to be
[3:51:03] <tanklets> I do like that the player character is a lady with big hips
[3:51:03] <+OwlLightningMage> Judgement cut end the planet of it's resources
[3:51:05] <%darklordfodder> "This thing is such a fucking shit mess, oh my god" - Put it on the back of the proverbial box.
[3:51:06] <Manwad> it's fine, your spaghetti is delicious
[3:51:08] <GunEden> lets game it out is the real shit mess
[3:51:10] <+vaderxyz1970> @ContainsSodium You mean the misunderstood startup just try to make a cleaner energy source for Earth?
[3:51:12] <+queaks> Just 41 rods
[3:51:13] <LVL1_Scumbag> If it's stupid, but it works, it's not really stupid
[3:51:17] <+ReallyBigRocks> biomass generator go brr
[3:51:20] <PinoProxie> <3
[3:51:21] <heartlesshealer> it's a big mess that says, "I am learning"
[3:51:21] <%Broand> Get them rods dude,
[3:51:22] <%Arancet> "I call it the Fuck The World Machines" what does it do? "It processes the EARTH"
[3:51:23] <+MisterAvry> I'd put this factory on the fridge for sure
[3:51:23] <%Ranryu692> get more leaves
[3:51:27] <%blastyoboots> you can steal it off the belt
[3:51:30] <SpaceManHotepIV> Very creativity
[3:51:35] <%AimlessStranger> Then just throw all the orphaned rabbits in the bio reactor and they won't have to be sad.
[3:51:37] <%asgard147> limesAw
[3:51:38] <%holydeviant1> the bweeeeem~ of a living factory and the bwoooooo~ os a dying one are so perfect
[3:51:38] <+crazyspartan214> not fast enough
[3:51:39] <mai_cu> lamp oil
[3:51:41] <CappuccinoGuil> 1 leaf per 0.8 sec
[3:51:44] <%Buzzard42> Buzzard42 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months! 1 year PogChamp
[3:51:45] <hat_under_bread> The three major food groups.
[3:51:46] <+LowBatteryLife> all the shit mess feeds the beautiful storage tower, the one perfect beacon of efficiency
[3:51:48] <CappuccinoGuil> Just make the rest
[3:51:49] <+king_of_beggars> I'm going to doordash some raw pig iron for manufacturing purposes right now, using promo code CASTLE to get 5 dollars off my first order of raw materials.
[3:51:59] <boogaleeboo> And while he pees the system works for him
[3:52:02] <BigNerdSam> How creative is Pat being?
[3:52:02] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> You can turn stuff off to slow down consumption
[3:52:02] <CappuccinoGuil> Play the game while you pee. Amazing
[3:52:03] <heartlesshealer> test how fast one of them goes through wood once you have enough
[3:52:05] <Tytangamer> I can't wait for Pat to tell Woolie to shut up about Ichiban so he can talk about concrete.
[3:52:09] <%Valdorick> More like wait on DEEZ RODZ
[3:52:11] <%holydeviant1> until it dies from no leaves
[3:52:13] <+JobbedBone> SourPls
[3:52:15] <gryffinp> until the burners run dry while he is pissing
[3:52:16] <EuropanLamprey> Make sure the thing is plugged in
[3:52:17] <ChungusQuest> This game feels like a training simulator for Captain Planet villains.
[3:52:21] <%darklordfodder> Next Milestone is a diaper.
[3:52:24] <%hamborgini> for all your hard work for fixit corp, you get a bonus! One (1) $25 gift card for Applebee's.
[3:52:29] <+OwlLightningMage> I hope Pat gets attacked by an alien while pissing LUL
[3:52:38] <%GeneralSCPatton> This whole bit is INCREDIBLE
[3:52:49] <%YakumoYomi> @hamborgini But Applebee's sucks...!
[3:52:50] <boogaleeboo> Really I think the lack of resource scarcity and the lack of penalty for tearing shit down makes this game a bit less overwhelming than some of the other games like it
[3:52:52] <CappuccinoGuil> @OwlLightningMage nah, there aren't any roaming enemies
[3:52:59] <BigNerdSam> @darklordfodder Nah too much mess, it's a catheter that goes straight into the pipes.
[3:53:01] <+ReallyBigRocks> Luckily the hostile aliens are in specific spots and don't really roam around
[3:53:02] <%AzureGale> Next Monday will be the epic battle between bread and concrete
[3:53:08] <boogaleeboo> Really the only thing that is an issue early on is power
[3:53:09] <+OwlLightningMage> Let me dream BibleThump
[3:53:10] <%MistyMntns> I have sunk a lot of hours into this game and I have an urge to fix everything.
[3:53:10] <%SilvaChariot0133> Deep Rock Galactic thanks you for your service, have a free beer Kappa
[3:53:19] <+vaderxyz1970> Corporate has decided its more cost effective to exterminautus the planet
[3:53:29] <%Nested_Dreams> @generalscpatton Pat's hyperactivity gives it away tho
[3:53:32] <CappuccinoGuil> @boogaleeboo I would like a hardcore mode where you actually have to be eco-friendly, but it goes against the tone of distopian corporate capitalism here
[3:54:09] <CappuccinoGuil> @mistymntns wait until he unlocks foundations LUL
[3:54:22] <%Idziman> Idziman subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 47 months! so close to the 4 year mark. Thanks for the fun times and here's to more. PS Congrats on becoming an American-to-be and your engagement to Paige
[3:54:34] <boogaleeboo> I mean he's running this entire operation off some leaves that regrew almost as fast as they burn
[3:54:41] <boogaleeboo> It's pretty friendly!
[3:54:43] <Tuna_Can_0> Are there logistic robots in satisfactory?
[3:54:57] <%holydeviant1> I want to make the most horrific, cable-cluttered, sphagetti-belted piece of shit factory on the fucking planet
[3:54:57] <gryffinp> Maybe? What's a logistic robot
[3:54:59] <boogaleeboo> we call them "players"
[3:55:10] <+ReallyBigRocks> @Tuna_Can_0 you can unlock self driving trucks
[3:55:16] <+queaks> You leave bioburners behind and never look back as soon as you can in this game
[3:55:19] <%Nested_Dreams> There be trucks that can be automated but they suck
[3:55:20] <PrishKitla> thats a graphitic
[3:55:22] <%holydeviant1> and it all outputs into a block of like twelve boxes stacked neatly
[3:55:24] <Profmcstevie> Can I just say this is the most raw delight I've seen on Pats face since announcing his engagement coneyVINCE
[3:55:34] <%Wurmspawn> No. The closest you get is vehicles that you can program to take routes between different places on the map to transport goods to differne tparts of the map wide factory.
[3:55:35] <+OwlLightningMage> Watch the trailer for this game. It's super nuts
[3:55:40] <Tuna_Can_0> @Griffin1171 in factorio you build a logistic network, where you can have little robots fly around and build stuff for you
[3:55:44] <+OwlLightningMage> You can unlock so much
[3:55:49] <%YakumoYomi> This is the kind of game that I'd stay up all night playing in VR.
[3:55:55] <+MrJackett> I thoght this was one of the LAST games Pat would like
[3:55:56] <%holydeviant1> He is going to sleep, and dream of efficient and clean setups
[3:56:10] <boogaleeboo> Never too efficient
[3:56:11] <+ReallyBigRocks> @Tuna_Can_0 you can't automate building, at least not yet
[3:56:14] <boogaleeboo> You want them long belts
[3:56:17] <boogaleeboo> See the things moving
[3:56:20] <+JobbedBone> 2020SpeakUp tomatoYell posture check
[3:56:21] <+OwlLightningMage> Pat likes these games until a mind goblin tells him not to
[3:56:23] <CrematedCube> It doesn't have a blueprint mode to my knowledge, everything is hand-placed
[3:56:31] <%holydeviant1> >Schedule update:  >Satisfactory in all slots
[3:56:43] <+queaks> I cant beleive the people who made goat simulator made this game
[3:56:51] <Tuna_Can_0> its still in alpha so should be interesting to see where it goes
[3:56:53] <%whyskeywolfe> Pat are you out of breath?
[3:56:53] <ContainsSodium> Wait what
[3:56:56] <iosephe> Yeah
[3:56:56] <+queaks> coffee stain studios
[3:56:57] <%SilvaChariot0133> and Deep Rock
[3:56:57] <+MrJackett> Yup
[3:56:58] <%Kaask> that's rad
[3:56:59] <gryffinp> what you're just NOW reading that
[3:56:59] <%Broand> Published Valheim too
[3:56:59] <+MisterAvry> wow
[3:57:00] <%TheWinged7> yup, one hell of a glowup
[3:57:00] <+OwlLightningMage> That doesn't surprise me.
[3:57:00] <SpaceManHotepIV> lolwut
[3:57:01] <$HyperionXV> They've made a lot of things
[3:57:04] <heartlesshealer> yeah
[3:57:05] <%SilvaChariot0133> and Valheim, or published atleast
[3:57:06] <Tuna_Can_0> PogChamp
[3:57:07] <BigNerdSam> Is number go big up?
[3:57:10] <Griffin1171> @Tuna_Can_0 Yeah, I played a ton of factorio
[3:57:14] <Profmcstevie> Yeah, and Sanctum
[3:57:14] <xbb1024> they are a publisher now
[3:57:15] <+MisterAvry> yeeee
[3:57:18] <%AzureGale> Interesting, they've come far from Sanctum
[3:57:18] <%Broand> Look out the top of your basse"!
[3:57:19] <+ReallyBigRocks> SPACE ELEVATOR TIME
[3:57:19] <zazzera01> yeaaah biomass
[3:57:19] <EvanDude47> now you can craft real fuel instead of burning leafs
[3:57:21] <%Nested_Dreams> Working out clean setups turned out to be too frustrating for me, instead i just made a factory that filled a chest with mats and then used overflow for other recipes
[3:57:21] <heartlesshealer> like, if you look at the trailer you can see some silliness break through
[3:57:22] <+zalonar> Space Elevator!?
[3:57:23] <+PersonifiedTFT> SPACE ELEVATOR
[3:57:23] <Zeemod155> hm seems like a natural evolution
[3:57:25] <%crimsonharvest> E L E V A T O R
[3:57:28] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Look up
[3:57:28] <gryffinp> Motivational Message: good job, piggy.
[3:57:29] <%holydeviant1> YOUR NEW GOAL IS THE SPACE ELEVATOR.
[3:57:29] <+MisterAvry> good job pat
[3:57:30] <%TheWinged7> @PatStaresAt and they made Deep Rock
[3:57:35] <Griffin1171> they published a lot too
[3:57:38] <Profmcstevie> I Imagine making Sanctum got them the skills they needed for this more than Goat sim LUL
[3:57:39] <tanklets> The publisher also has their hands in some good pies. Deep Rock, Valheim
[3:57:49] <+queaks> Check how bbig the space elevator is
[3:57:50] <EvanDude47> @TheWinged7 published deep rock
[3:57:50] <%Monkeyweed21> ADA WAIT
[3:57:51] <+MisterAvry> space elevator is life
[3:57:52] <BwdYeti> They made the tower defense/shooter Sanctum also
[3:57:53] <+ReallyBigRocks> It ELEVATES
[3:57:53] <%crimsonharvest> it goes to space
[3:57:55] <+TheBobulus> BTW, Pat, the ratio of power needed to power supplied determines rate of leaf burnage, so if you have more burners, the leaves will burn slower
[3:57:55] <whobeee> You can now get the good fuel I think
[3:57:56] <iosephe> BUILD IT
[3:57:56] <+TipsyND> The real Satisfactory begins now
[3:57:56] <%holydeviant1> THE SPACE ELEVATOR IS MORE TASKS
[3:57:59] <%QueequegTheater> It starts wars with Belka
[3:58:00] <%Valdorick> Elevates to space
[3:58:00] <BigNerdSam> we go space now?
[3:58:01] <EvanDude47> tutorial over
[3:58:06] <CappuccinoGuil> You want LOGISTICS
[3:58:07] <gryffinp> There it is
[3:58:07] <xbb1024> and there goes the power
[3:58:08] <heartlesshealer> =)
[3:58:09] <+OwlLightningMage> The real game starts now

[3:58:14] <%CommanderSqueaks> Welcome to the real game, Pat.
[3:58:17] <%Broand> You can place the space elevator anywhere, welcome to the main game
[3:58:17] <%XeroSigmaPrime> The Steam trailer for this game is fucking GOLD
[3:58:17] <+TheBobulus> get foundations and then rebuild your  base in a better spot
[3:58:18] <%Monkeyweed21> IT BEGINS
[3:58:18] <+MisterAvry> it's basically your "quest giver"
[3:58:19] <%QueequegTheater> FUEL
[3:58:20] <%AimlessStranger> it elevates space
[3:58:21] <%Nested_Dreams> GAME START
[3:58:21] <ChungusQuest> Deep Rock!  I knew Coffee Stain sounded familiar.
[3:58:23] <%QueequegTheater> BIOENERGY
[3:58:27] <heartlesshealer> enjoy building more pockets
[3:58:30] <gryffinp> jump pads are DOPE. Dubiously useful, but DOPE.
[3:58:31] <%holydeviant1> y advice is to build an assembly line for biomass asap
[3:58:32] <EvanDude47> @PatStaresAt tutorial over, begin game
[3:58:34] <RzdAkira> That power dying sound is really haunting
[3:58:49] <heartlesshealer> =)
[3:58:52] <Visorak6> Take your time pat
[3:58:52] <+ReallyBigRocks> The brain start now
[3:58:53] <%SilvaChariot0133> doodBigBrain
[3:58:55] <xbb1024> all the brain looking...
[3:58:58] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> This game is not short.
[3:58:59] <+MisterAvry> many brane yes
[3:59:01] <Profmcstevie> Take your time, feel it out
[3:59:02] <+OwlLightningMage> Brain start now

[3:59:03] <%crimsonharvest> i can feel the brain energy starting to churn
[3:59:04] <ChungusQuest> Look!  Look with your special brain!
[3:59:09] <+Rofiarf> how is pat doing?
[3:59:11] <%YakumoYomi> The big brain am winning again?
[3:59:12] <heartlesshealer> (for real though, take your time)
[3:59:13] <+TheBobulus> Productivity Display is kinda cursed: It tells you rate of input / output of items in machines, so you can OPTIMIZE
[3:59:16] <Tuna_Can_0> Big braining start now
[3:59:19] <+MisterAvry> this where you're up until 4am
[3:59:22] <%Agami23> you beat the tutorial
[3:59:24] <gryffinp> I might be tempted to make a suggestion but lets be honest, they're all good.
[3:59:25] <%Valdorick> The Mid Game
[3:59:33] <KShirahama> TIP: automate biofuel ASAP
[3:59:34] <+OwlLightningMage> Bean Dad will not feed you until you finish this elevator
[3:59:35] <+queaks> Look how many tiers you still havent unlocked as well
[3:59:37] <sleepy_panda42> This is one of those rare games that made me feel mentally exhausted after a full day of play, and i loved every minute of it
[3:59:38] <%DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt random thought but do you ever crack you knuckles or wrist?
[3:59:38] <+JobbedBone> do you ever get "blueprints" that let you lay down a network of buildings at once?
[3:59:43] <%holydeviant1> Welcome to the early game, Pat
[3:59:43] <+queaks> Check how big the space elevator is
[3:59:45] <+darkmega354> also, don't sleep on the AWESOME sink, there are legit useful parts you get from there
[3:59:48] <CappuccinoGuil> Pat, Biomass, make some
[3:59:49] <%Dunmarkh> the real dark souls starts here
[3:59:55] <+GrandmasterBFunk> Strive got delayed to June

[4:00:02] <%BoxNavy> @PatStaresAt ggstrive got delayed to june
[4:00:02] <+MisterAvry> yeah automating biofuel (and thus power) is a good idea
[4:00:03] <RzdAkira> Biomass crafting time
[4:00:04] <boogaleeboo> Space elevator is probably the most emotionally satisfying thing to do
[4:00:07] <BwdYeti> LUL
[4:00:07] <%holydeviant1> it's a big boy.
[4:00:07] <gryffinp> its a big fuckin lad

[4:02:09] <CappuccinoGuil> A delay? GOOD! Take their time, I say
[4:02:10] <heartlesshealer> Okay, but they're remaking the LOBBY
[4:02:14] <%TheBensonator_> It'll have better lobbies - that's good! But the game is delayed - that's bad!

[4:02:22] <%AzureGale> A delayed game is eventually good etc. etc.
[4:02:22] <+ALazo> people really made a lot of noise about that lobby
[4:02:26] <%holydeviant1> its okay pat, it'll come oout
[4:02:26] <MoonKing> delay will be worth it if lobby isn't shit anymore LUL
[4:02:27] <%aishman> This is all Max's fault for complaining so much about the Lobby system
[4:02:29] <ammobasket> Let’s all go to the lobby!
[4:02:31] <+terraspan> Gotta build those dedicated servers.
[4:02:31] <MayorRev> I don't get it, why's everyone upset that they're improving the game

[4:03:16] <+JustToWatch> I really hope we get another beta
[4:03:19] <+OwlLightningMage> I would rather the fucking remove the lobbies entirely
[4:03:21] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Building on a foundation has a built in grid to snap to.
[4:03:21] <tanklets> You can get more weird foundation parts from the AWESOME shop. But thats later
[4:03:23] <%crimsonharvest> because fashion
[4:03:24] <tanklets> To climb
[4:03:25] <%Cybercobra2> they cost the same
[4:03:26] <gryffinp> spacing I guess
[4:03:28] <tanklets> stairs
[4:03:28] <%SilvaChariot0133> Because number go up Kappa
[4:03:29] <moosemonkey397> its just height
[4:03:29] <boogaleeboo> aesthetics
[4:03:30] <%MistyMntns> To Flatnen places
[4:03:30] <%Broand> They're the same price
[4:03:31] <+TipsyND> Looks
[4:03:31] <+queaks> If you are building a sky scraper you dont want thick floors
[4:03:32] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Height.
[4:03:34] <$HyperionXV> Fancy building
[4:03:35] <+Sir_Dolphinian> to make go taller?
[4:03:35] <%holydeviant1> spacing
[4:03:35] <%TheWinged7> when you need to match different elevations on a hill
[4:03:36] <zazzera01> different heights and ramps
[4:03:36] <xbb1024> for height
[4:03:37] <%Broand> But it go up
[4:03:37] <%bevyrage> spacing and height
[4:03:38] <%valriot> ITS THE SAME DAY AS FF7 REMAKE INTERGRADE LUL LUL RIP MAX
[4:03:39] <LVL1_Scumbag> One is bigger
[4:03:39] <%crimsonharvest> im not joking its because fashion or because you want a specific angle
[4:03:42] <+OwlLightningMage> The lobbies in those games suck anyway. Just make it a list
[4:03:45] <+PersonifiedTFT> however you want to build the thing
[4:03:48] <+MisterAvry> ooh conveyor lifts
[4:03:48] <%MelBrooksKA> Making foundation level
[4:03:48] <%Nested_Dreams> Base building is lego, and everything on foundation snaps nicely to grid
[4:03:50] <%Cn_alpha_02> Tall

[4:04:36] <moosemonkey397> energy solutions!
[4:04:40] <$Trenr> solid biofuel!
[4:04:47] <Mr_Rakjo> beeg energy @PatStaresAt
[4:04:48] <tanklets> I always found the jump pads to be kinda worthless
[4:04:49] <+queaks> You can just build them now
[4:04:54] <CappuccinoGuil> Pat, make some biomass
[4:04:58] <+OwlLightningMage> The background music is good.
[4:05:02] <+PersonifiedTFT> This bullshit is NOT BLAZING
[4:05:16] <%Monkeyweed21> you can make better biomass now
[4:05:19] <+OwlLightningMage> Bullshit is not blazing indeed.
[4:05:20] <+ReallyBigRocks> It burn longer
[4:05:21] <tanklets> Better fuel
[4:05:23] <Mr_Rakjo> Better fuel for electricity @PatStaresAt
[4:05:23] <CappuccinoGuil> It's a great fuel source
[4:05:24] <$Trenr> it's better than leaves and wood
[4:05:24] <tanklets> Burns slower
[4:05:24] <Griffin1171> it burns slow
[4:05:24] <%QueequegTheater> better fuel
[4:05:25] <moosemonkey397> turn leaves into more energy.
[4:05:26] <%holydeviant1> most efficient fuel
[4:05:26] <gryffinp> It goes into biomass burners but better
[4:05:26] <zazzera01> better than biomass
[4:05:27] <%depressed_skeleton> Better fuel
[4:05:27] <+BusterRepukken> ironic Arcsys made fun of CDPR for their yellow delay messages.
[4:05:28] <whobeee> It means you can turn your leaves into better fuel
[4:05:28] <$HyperionXV> It burns at a better rate
[4:05:28] <iosephe> It's fuel, and it's more efficient
[4:05:28] <%depressed_skeleton> Fuel go up
[4:05:28] <xbb1024> takes longer to run out
[4:05:29] <%hamborgini> it's more efficient than leaves
[4:05:29] <Zaphire_Saucypants> more efficient
[4:05:29] <+queaks> Craft it and it burns better
[4:05:30] <%Cybercobra2> you turn leaves and wood into that stuff which burns better
[4:05:31] <%Broand> Solid biofuel go into biomass burner and burn longer
[4:05:32] <%Nested_Dreams> Even better fuel
[4:05:34] <+TheMorilo> burns slowly
[4:05:35] <+Strigiform> you push all the leaves into plant tube and it burns better
[4:05:35] <Tuna_Can_0> I make biomass every morning Kappa
[4:05:36] <huskarl_zap> Biomass = Spitenut
[4:05:37] <+spacetitanium22> did you hear strive is delayed?
[4:05:37] <+TheBobulus> Solid biofuel is made from leaves and takes longer to burn, so you can effectively load more in a burner
[4:05:37] <%asgard147> It burns longer
[4:05:37] <%bevyrage> solid biofule is more efficient biomass
[4:05:38] <chaosbringer28> better fuel, can be made from leaves or wood
[4:05:39] <%Jekado> Solid biofeul is more efficent
[4:05:39] <CappuccinoGuil> Leaves turn into Biomass. Biomass turns into Biofuel.
[4:05:40] <zazzera01> make leaves and wood into biomass
[4:05:40] <zedravan> compost
[4:05:40] <CrematedCube> Craft natural shit into long burning shit
[4:05:43] <+queaks> Craft bench
[4:05:44] <%Nested_Dreams> Check out crafting bench
[4:05:44] <%depressed_skeleton> Both
[4:05:44] <%Jekado> both
[4:05:46] <%hamborgini> crafting bench
[4:05:47] <+ReallyBigRocks> @PatStaresAt Both
[4:05:47] <%holydeviant1> YES
[4:05:48] <tanklets> You can automate it
[4:05:49] <$Trenr> constructors will do that for you, yes
[4:05:49] <%Cybercobra2> constructors can do it
[4:05:49] <%Broand> You can make biomass right now actually
[4:05:49] <%Jekado> you can do it both ways
[4:05:50] <%crimsonharvest> no you dump your leaves and stuff in a box feeding to a constructor
[4:05:50] <%holydeviant1> YES TO BOTH
[4:05:50] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Bench
[4:05:50] <+TheBobulus> on person or with constructor
[4:05:51] <zazzera01> yes
[4:05:51] <%Broand> at the bench
[4:05:51] <Mr_Rakjo> both
[4:05:52] <Griffin1171> make a machine to do it for you
[4:05:52] <KShirahama> both
[4:05:52] <gryffinp> Check the craft bench and also constructors
[4:05:52] <%bevyrage> craft bench or constructor
[4:05:53] <Sollidnitro> yes
[4:05:55] <chaosbringer28> constructors can build it
[4:05:56] <CappuccinoGuil> Everything YOU can craft, a Constructor can make
[4:05:56] <%Monkeyweed21> crafting
[4:05:56] <tanklets> But you;'ll always have to keep putting shit in it
[4:05:58] <%Broand> and you can feed it into a constructor too
[4:06:03] <Karebuncle> You can do it in inventory if you need to
[4:06:04] <+JobbedBone> its always both Kappa
[4:06:06] <Ravioli_Ronin> You put pee po in the machine
[4:06:07] <+TheBobulus> constructor can do it, BUT, no way way to conveyor into bioburner
[4:06:08] <%AimlessStranger> it means the animals you throw in are pure bred.
[4:06:10] <%Wurmspawn> Anything you can make a constructor will be able to make it. But not vice versa.
[4:06:10] <%Broand> By hand :<
[4:06:12] <moosemonkey397> the new generators can be placed
[4:06:15] <%holydeviant1> You have to gather the base item first, but afterr that, you can automate it
[4:06:17] <+queaks> Basically yeah
[4:06:18] <%holydeviant1> yes
[4:06:18] <+MrJackett> Yes
[4:06:19] <%Broand> Yes
[4:06:19] <$Trenr> pretty much yes
[4:06:19] <tanklets> A bit
[4:06:20] <%Jekado> yeah
[4:06:21] <Griffin1171> yeah
[4:06:22] <%CommanderSqueaks> For now
[4:06:23] <%Cybercobra2> yea, biomass you always need to harvest yourself
[4:06:23] <gryffinp> Yeah
[4:06:24] <CappuccinoGuil> Put leaves into a container, link it to a constructor, done
[4:06:25] <%furiousfurioso> yes for biomass, better electricity is later
[4:06:25] <%Broand> you cannot harvest automatically
[4:06:25] <%bevyrage> basically
[4:06:25] <tanklets> THats why theres coal and oil
[4:06:25] <+TheMorilo> yup
[4:06:25] <+TheBobulus> yeah, manual until Coal
[4:06:27] <%Jekado> biomass is used for fuel for some tools
[4:06:28] <chaosbringer28> yes
[4:06:30] <CrematedCube> Until we get to coal power, yes
[4:06:30] <tanklets> And uranium
[4:06:30] <%Jekado> or a tool?
[4:06:31] <KShirahama> until you get coal power
[4:06:32] <%crimsonharvest> coal is the goal
[4:06:32] <%Cn_alpha_02> You can automate everything, eventually.
[4:06:32] <%bevyrage> YO that stingray is sick
[4:06:33] <%holydeviant1> coal is the automated power option
[4:06:36] <%Jekado> coal is automatic
[4:06:37] <+queaks> But it can be made more efficient until
[4:06:42] <CappuccinoGuil> Pat, you have BIOMASS now
[4:06:44] <%blastyoboots> COAL and OIL oh YEAH that rules!
[4:06:47] <+queaks> Chainsaw is great
[4:06:48] <moosemonkey397> chainsaw for wood is real good
[4:06:49] <tanklets> I think you got basic biomass already with the last upgrade
[4:06:49] <+ReallyBigRocks> @PatStaresAt I usually make a crate that feeds into a biomass constructor so I can dump multiple stacks
[4:06:51] <+MisterAvry> how about solar, is there solar? powerful enough to run a whole factory?
[4:06:51] <%bevyrage> you know you want that chainsaw
[4:06:54] <%QueequegTheater> BIOENERGY
[4:06:54] <xbb1024> yeah, you want to get to oil
[4:06:57] <%crimsonharvest> the chainsaw lets you chop down big shit fast, gathering speed go WAY UP
[4:06:58] <%bevyrage> YOU CAN CUT DOWN TREES WITH THAT PAT
[4:07:00] <gryffinp> @PatStaresAt You already unlocked the ability to turn leaves and wood into level 1 biomass actually, check the bench
[4:07:02] <Griffin1171> chainsaw good
[4:07:16] <%Monkeyweed21> lol pats dum
[4:07:18] <+Metalwahl> aw fuck just saw the strive news
[4:07:23] <%bevyrage> spacebar pat
[4:07:26] <tanklets> Theres a solar power mod I now
[4:07:29] <gryffinp> It happened when you finished tier 0
[4:07:31] <%Broand> That'll last longer than leaves will at least
[4:07:33] <tanklets> Lots of mods for this game
[4:07:34] <%crimsonharvest> its fine there's a ton of shit to miss
[4:07:34] <TundraOW> @Metalwahl what happen?
[4:07:39] <%crimsonharvest> and by miss i mean words on the screen
[4:07:43] <+JobbedBone> can you run this on potato with the right settings? BibleThump
[4:07:53] <gryffinp> ha ha hud scaling
[4:07:58] <KShirahama> you can automate biomass by going storage>constructor>storage
[4:07:58] <%Nested_Dreams> Chainsaw is an alright first choice, if you can grind the better fuel production line
[4:08:00] <NitronStreams> Now this party's gettin crazy
[4:08:00] <%Jekado> this is where multiplayer helps because one person just focus on power
[4:08:02] <Ravioli_Ronin> Remember to make sure your nanobots can self replicate AND convert any and all biomass into fuel
[4:08:06] <+queaks> You have large inventory icons on as well I think
[4:08:16] <gryffinp> @Jekado Being that one person sounds like a bad time
[4:08:22] <%Broand> 900 seconds
[4:08:23] <Profmcstevie> Man this game is Early Access? and only been so for bout 8 months? Superb
[4:08:24] <CrematedCube> I have a very old computer and this game still runs surprisingly well
[4:08:26] <moosemonkey397> 15 minutes
[4:08:28] <+JobbedBone> ...
[4:08:31] <+queaks> so 30 minutes per stack
[4:08:31] <boogaleeboo> That's more than 10 times better than leaves
[4:08:31] <%Monkeyweed21> 15 minutes
[4:08:31] <+Metalwahl> @Metalwahl delay but oh well
[4:08:35] <+TheMorilo> oh my god
[4:08:37] <+queaks> Much better
[4:08:37] <peyodogo> holy fuck, pat's in hd
[4:08:39] <DrkJP520> wow google is smart
[4:08:39] <Killahaseo> veralaHype
[4:08:40] <+crazyspartan214> lazy math
[4:08:40] <+TheMorilo> baby brain
[4:08:41] <%DianaTheAscian> I almost had it
[4:08:44] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Pat, N is a calculator.
[4:08:45] <EvanDude47> real fuel achieved instead of fuckin leaves
[4:08:46] <+Sycada> STOP HACKING MY PHONE
[4:08:47] <%Jekado> @gryffinp its fast with the saw and when you do oil you need one person to plan it out
[4:08:52] <$lotharrio> Big baby brain.
[4:08:55] <%crimsonharvest> The game constantly causes you problems, then gives you tools to solve them its great
[4:08:56] <Profmcstevie> Ask google faster than be good at mental math
[4:08:58] <+ReallyBigRocks> One is on standby still
[4:08:58] <+shambarino> You fucking got my home lmfao
[4:08:59] <+queaks> Build a third burner
[4:09:00] <%Broand> are they not joined together?
[4:09:02] <gryffinp> You flipped the standby switch
[4:09:05] <CappuccinoGuil> One is on standby
[4:09:05] <+queaks> You need another burner
[4:09:05] <whobeee> Connect your damn power together you oaf
[4:09:05] <%Cybercobra2> is one on standby?
[4:09:06] <+TheBobulus> @PatStaresAt that's the burn rate at 100% power usage. If you have power to spare, they'll burn slower
[4:09:07] <tanklets> Be sure to set up some of your own biomass burners. Beef up the power grid
[4:09:08] <%MistyMntns> You need another biomass burner
[4:09:09] <Griffin1171> feed both
[4:09:11] <%Cybercobra2> ah there we go
[4:09:12] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> The game has a calculator button.
[4:09:14] <%blastyoboots> @peyodogo At the beginning of the stream he said he found out his camera had been set to 640x480 input for the last FOUR YEARS
[4:09:18] <TundraOW> This might be the worst game to backseat for
[4:09:18] <jorniev> what is happening with pat now?
[4:09:18] <BlueLunecy> Must be jammed, stick your arm in there
[4:09:18] <%blastyoboots> and he JUST fixed it
[4:09:20] <Mr_Rakjo> Too much power Drainage you need another burner @PatStaresAt
[4:09:25] <$lotharrio> Pat this game looks oddly creative. Why aren't you angry and upset at it?
[4:09:25] <%Cybercobra2> always apreciate a photo mode
[4:09:26] <%Monkeyweed21> screws @PatStaresAt
[4:09:27] <%MistyMntns> You are reaching the limits of your gen output
[4:09:28] <%crimsonharvest> you need a builder, and a box to put your leaves in that can feed the builder
[4:09:29] <+queaks> Woah didnt know this game had photomode
[4:09:34] <peyodogo> @blastyoboots lmfaooooo yeah that would explain some stuff, huh
[4:09:39] <Profmcstevie> Taking pictures of my awesome factory, now THAT'S a good feature LUL
[4:09:47] <%Broand> If you had a splitter, you could make plates AND rods
[4:09:53] <CappuccinoGuil> Pat, when you swap a production recipe, it puts the ingots in your inventory.
[4:10:00] <%Cybercobra2> it burns biolantes
[4:10:03] <%DapperDansDandyBand> DapperDansDandyBand subscribed at Tier 3. 
[4:10:09] <+ReallyBigRocks> yeah just stick it right in the middle of everything
[4:10:11] <%bevyrage> burners don't need much for placement since you're attaching wires to it
[4:10:25] <+JustToWatch> WAIT FUCK, FF7R intergrade comes out the day before strive
[4:10:31] <%Ranryu692> SHR3D-D3R
[4:10:40] <+ReallyBigRocks> uh oh no more expansion for wires
[4:10:46] <Profmcstevie> It's gonna be a wild Summer in 2021 so far boys
[4:10:47] <+redyoshi5> @justtowatch ohh god no
[4:10:51] <+JustToWatch> I just realized that....
[4:10:56] <Profmcstevie> I can wait for Strive forever
[4:11:01] <+queaks> Screws need rods no ingots
[4:11:03] <tanklets> Need rods for screws
[4:11:04] <DrkJP520> How big is the map?
[4:11:05] <gryffinp> but screws require rods
[4:11:06] <+OwlLightningMage> Strive now
[4:11:11] <CappuccinoGuil> Screws meed rods, not ingots
[4:11:13] <+OwlLightningMage> Want Strive now
[4:11:16] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Rods into Screws
[4:11:23] <drk_sd> uh bad time for strive news?
[4:11:25] <+redyoshi5> time to beat the ff7 dlc in one day sleep be damned
[4:11:29] <blue8moon> screws need iron rods
[4:11:31] <Visorak6> Missing a step
[4:11:31] <%Broand> Eats iron rods
[4:11:33] <whobeee> It needs rods
[4:11:34] <kazadaz> hell yeah he does
[4:11:35] <tanklets> May be better to get the splitter milestone first
[4:11:36] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt it says over the picture of the finished item
[4:11:38] <Mr_Rakjo> RODS TO SCREWS
[4:11:41] <%TheWinged7> it needs rods
[4:11:47] <kazadaz> eats screws n leaves
[4:11:51] <%QueequegTheater> start over
[4:11:52] <+queaks> Screw your rods pat
[4:11:54] <+ReallyBigRocks> need more constructors
[4:11:59] <%blastyoboots> plates > rods > screws
[4:12:02] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> or send your rod storage into a screwstructor
[4:12:08] <+ReallyBigRocks> welcome to the cycle
[4:12:10] <CappuccinoGuil> Oooor you could have 1 constructor making rods linked into 1 constructor making screws
[4:12:18] <%Broand> nothin much
[4:12:19] <+BusterRepukken> sad over the delay
[4:12:19] <drk_sd> strive news
[4:12:20] <xbb1024> we good
[4:12:20] <kazadaz> i see the goblins have receded
[4:12:21] <%CommanderSqueaks> I am so sleepy.
[4:12:26] <%QueequegTheater> yes you do
[4:12:26] <+queaks> How you feeling pat?
[4:12:28] <CappuccinoGuil> There's a trash in your inventory
[4:12:30] <@SoFarFetched> just chilling watching the stream geefSmush
[4:12:32] <Profmcstevie> Watching a grown man giggle at machinery and loving it
[4:12:32] <%asgard147> I'm sad cosa Strive limesFeels
[4:12:32] <%Ranryu692> Nintendo is launching the stronger Switch this fall, according to Bloomberg
[4:12:36] <tanklets> I need a beer actually
[4:12:40] <Tuna_Can_0> or what?
[4:12:43] <%DianaTheAscian> building a rx-93 rg kit @PatStaresAt
[4:12:44] <%blastyoboots> screws are not manual they are made from rods
[4:12:45] <penitentpendant> Discussing with a friend in FF14 that the next plot point is NOT the '8th Umbral Calamity' because of plot
[4:12:46] <kazadaz> i'm not working
[4:12:50] <%MistyMntns> It is taking all of my power not to try to organize your factory
[4:12:51] <CappuccinoGuil> You can trash items from your inventory, in the can.
[4:12:52] <Visorak6> It might be best when you're ready to rebuild to dump everything in your storage units then wipe it all to reorganize
[4:12:56] <+queaks> Might actually get hyrul warriors
[4:12:59] <Saltmeisterr> THAT SHIT IS A LIE
[4:13:01] <NitronStreams> HMMMMMMMMMM
[4:13:02] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt I finished levelling RDM and got the end of Ardbert's story, that was cool
[4:13:03] <ToneBacas> now 20FPS PogChamp
[4:13:04] <Profmcstevie> What GPU will Switch Pro use though LUL
[4:13:08] <%XeroSigmaPrime> LIES
[4:13:10] <+OwlLightningMage> It will be 2 percent stronger
[4:13:11] <ammobasket> Miner > storage > smelter
[4:13:11] <+queaks> @PatStaresAt Remember how witcher 3 came out on switch?
[4:13:11] <Saltmeisterr> DON'T BELIEVE THOSE RUMORS
[4:13:12] <%asgard147> If they don't get SCALPED FIRST
[4:13:13] <%Broand> You might benefit from unlocking the research machine and going for an exploration session, because exploration in this game is super good
[4:13:14] <%Ranryu692> it's gonna have a 720p OLED screen supposedly
[4:13:15] <%YakumoYomi> Yeah, maybe it'll be a solid 25fps
[4:13:15] <penitentpendant> Age of (Frame) Calamity
[4:13:15] <%Nested_Dreams> You may want to put crates between machines so you can drop crap off into the production line
[4:13:17] <%cvp5127> i just want an ssd
[4:13:18] <%AzureGale> I'll believe it when Nintendo themselves announces it
[4:13:20] <cherrycottontail> remember the last 3 times we had that rumor
[4:13:20] <+OwlLightningMage> I don't believe them
[4:13:25] <+Solutha> massive worldwide chip shortage LMAO
[4:13:28] <%MistyMntns> Craft bench is overheating
[4:13:32] <T_Sasquatch> @QueequegTheater does rdm get less incredibly boring ?
[4:13:32] <kazadaz> Swiitch
[4:13:33] <%DianaTheAscian> It'll have themes @PatStaresAt
[4:13:34] <%QueequegTheater> fair
[4:13:34] <+OwlLightningMage> The FPS will go up by 3
[4:13:34] <+JustToWatch> It doesn't say that it's stronger, just bigger OLED display
[4:13:34] <%Wurmspawn> That's provided purchase bots don't swallow up all the release products.
[4:13:36] <+Walopoh> Still 720p apparently
[4:13:39] <+BusterRepukken> >720p still classic nintendo
[4:13:44] <+queaks> What was the developer name of the switch again?
[4:13:45] <Sunstalker> Just reading your retweets and finding out in the comments that dragonball had a plagiarizing composer.
[4:13:48] <+Pyr0_Fr0st> oh boy another console for scalpers
[4:13:52] <Ravioli_Ronin> Fuck outta here w/720p
[4:14:02] <DrkJP520> Forget the Switch. When's PC Pro coming out?
[4:14:05] <%Nested_Dreams> Also, Pat, you will need a production line for every single item
[4:14:08] <kazadaz> it'll be kind of underpowered yet inexplicably really good at bitcoin mining
[4:14:09] <%QueequegTheater> @T_Sasquatch Hey, I'm on controller, I literally can't handle SMN and I'm too unga bunga to BLM
[4:14:18] <%SirGO0SE> @PatStaresAt I've been theorizing that we havent seen Bayo, Metroid, or BOTW2 footage because theres something that would give away the new Switch
[4:14:20] <%blastyoboots> @BusterRepukken I don't care about any bigger than 720p give me some FUCKING FRAMERATE
[4:14:24] <+queaks> Get foundations first. Makes this so much better
[4:14:28] <xbb1024> yeah, that's when you make your super factory
[4:14:30] <%QueequegTheater> @T_Sasquatch Also I like the RDM rythym
[4:14:33] <Profmcstevie> Begone Switch Pro, Give me PC 2
[4:14:41] <+MisterAvry> do it
[4:14:42] <%QueequegTheater> DEW IT
[4:14:42] <tanklets> Foundations before that
[4:14:44] <kazadaz> The Factory Must Grow
[4:14:44] <+ReallyBigRocks> Yeah that's the way
[4:14:45] <%Arancet> learn more first
[4:14:46] <%DianaTheAscian> do it coward
[4:14:46] <TundraOW> Follow your dreams
[4:14:46] <tanklets> Need em
[4:14:46] <Ravioli_Ronin> I just want it to scale up to HD on dock mode there’s no excuse for it to not
[4:14:47] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Wait for foundations!
[4:14:47] <NitronStreams> SCORCHED EARTH
[4:14:50] <LVL1_Scumbag> good
[4:14:50] <Veluren> Rebuild it better!
[4:14:50] <gryffinp> foundations though
[4:14:51] <T_Sasquatch> @QueequegTheater LUL
[4:14:51] <+ReallyBigRocks> Burn it all to the ground
[4:14:51] <CappuccinoGuil> Get foundations, then you can tear it all down
[4:14:53] <+vaderxyz1970> Thats called progress
[4:14:53] <cherrycottontail> DO IT COWARD
[4:14:53] <heartlesshealer> 8 )
[4:14:54] <ToneBacas> it's gonna be the big refactoring
[4:14:54] <$Trenr> DO IT YOU WON'T
[4:14:55] <%blastyoboots> Foundations first
[4:14:55] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt that's normal after you've built up a bit
[4:14:55] <Profmcstevie> OH YEAH, DO IT. BIG BRAIN ON
[4:14:56] <penitentpendant> Get that Foundation research done
[4:14:56] <boogaleeboo> Tearing it down hurts nothing, but always finish a close up milestone first
[4:14:57] <$SGrim> The true game begins once you do that very thing, Pat DatSheffy
[4:14:58] <+Strigiform> Swallow the land in perfect concrete tiling
[4:14:58] <tanklets> The grid pat the GRID
[4:14:59] <moosemonkey397> foundations first. so you can replace it on an even field
[4:15:02] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Pat, don't fight your goblins.  Use them to empower your designs!
[4:15:03] <+queaks> I think thats kinda the optimal play pat. No point rushing straight into a clean factory right off the bat
[4:15:03] <+MisterAvry> It must be done for the greater good
[4:15:05] <%dj_xo98> Do it coward
[4:15:05] <kazadaz> it's inevitable
[4:15:06] <gryffinp> honestly, a reasonable path.
[4:15:06] <+OwlLightningMage> Do it you coward
[4:15:11] <Megalofyte> build a better factory before you trash your old one
[4:15:12] <+thegalvanicpanic> plus its not like you lose resources
[4:15:13] <$Stari> Do it
[4:15:14] <%shruke> foundations and splitters then tear down
[4:15:15] <CrematedCube> Get those foundations and pave it all
[4:15:16] <tanklets> Make a sky factory
[4:15:17] <EuropanLamprey> It's the point in Minecraft where you move out of your Dirt House
[4:15:17] <+JobbedBone> Overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer Kappa
[4:15:17] <%Broand> That's a good flat spot
[4:15:18] <Ipsenscastle> what's your actual goal here?
[4:15:22] <tanklets> Those hills can be a bitch
[4:15:22] <%Ranryu692> build a floor
[4:15:22] <DrkJP520> You know what they're gonna call the next Switch model? "New Nintendo Switch"
[4:15:23] <+vaderxyz1970> Turn this garden of eden into a parking lot
[4:15:25] <+thegalvanicpanic> this game is really forgiving
[4:15:28] <+darkmega354> that's exactly where I built my first factory
[4:15:29] <TundraOW> God I wish that were me
[4:15:33] <+D00msDayDan> did i come back in time to see him unlock foundations?
[4:15:33] <Griffin1171> New Patopia
[4:15:34] <+darkmega354> such a nice flat area
[4:15:34] <tanklets> Some great machine animations
[4:15:37] <+queaks> The aesthetics of this game are top tier
[4:15:41] <CappuccinoGuil> Pat, foundations create a GRID. Perfect angles for placing constructors
[4:15:42] <%notsoy> is there a miner mk2?
[4:15:43] <%Garthunox> oof that strive delay
[4:15:43] <Profmcstevie> Industrial level machinery is fucking cool dude
[4:15:46] <kazadaz> Concrete the world til it's clean
[4:15:46] <penitentpendant> Pat's Numbers are going up, his Fisnets STRAIN to contain him
[4:15:48] <%QueequegTheater> @T_Sasquatch Also I actually don't find RDM boring personally.
[4:15:51] <boogaleeboo> The best part is seeing all the machines chooching along
[4:15:52] <blink289> yes
[4:15:54] <xeros720> all of pat's goblins have adorable construction hats on
[4:15:54] <tanklets> mk2 and 3 I think
[4:15:55] <%Cybercobra2> dude the way thatt he driller actually grabs extra tubes periodicly and attached em to the drill
[4:15:57] <%Cybercobra2> its heaven
[4:15:57] <%shruke> you could also explore the world some cause the world is super cool
[4:15:59] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt does this aggravate or relief some of your goblins?
[4:16:12] <%Broand> Go outside and look
[4:16:12] <tanklets> Oh yeah
[4:16:13] <penitentpendant> That is a BIG red button
[4:16:13] <+queaks> Go outside and watch the pod
[4:16:14] <blue8moon> santa!
[4:16:14] <Profmcstevie> BUTTON
[4:16:15] <kazadaz> Pat is Dyson Sphere Program on your radar?
[4:16:16] <CrematedCube> Look up outside
[4:16:16] <tanklets> Look at it go
[4:16:19] <+JobbedBone> WATCH
[4:16:20] <NitronStreams> Santa?
[4:16:20] <%Broand> Look up!
[4:16:20] <boogaleeboo> LOOK UP
[4:16:20] <tanklets> Behind
[4:16:20] <%Cybercobra2> oh its still the christmas button LUL
[4:16:22] <CappuccinoGuil> LOOK OUTSIDE
[4:16:24] <DrkJP520> Summon Santa
[4:16:24] <Dumple_Roe> CHRISTMAS TIME
[4:16:29] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Pat, don't fight your goblins. Use them to empower your designs! Just because it's not classically "pretty" doesn't mean it doesn't hold value FOR YOU.
[4:16:30] <+D00msDayDan> B I O M A S S
[4:16:30] <gryffinp> so it's not normally a santa sleigh but they're too lazy to turn off the christmas mode before they just drop the update
[4:16:36] <CappuccinoGuil> Byeeeeee
[4:16:40] <+ReallyBigRocks> CHAINSAW TIME
[4:16:42] <NitronStreams> ???
[4:16:42] <xbb1024> your pocket dimension has been inflated!
[4:16:43] <+queaks> Goes to rnd on the space station
[4:16:45] <%Broand> There goes your resources
[4:16:46] <Profmcstevie> God now I gotta stare at Dyson Sphere Program on steam for an hour....again
[4:16:47] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Now that's just nice.
[4:16:49] <%Ranryu692> was that supposed to happen?
[4:16:50] <heartlesshealer> videochessPaw
[4:16:51] <%asgard147> limesYay
[4:16:53] <tanklets> My hub ended up being perfectly placed so that when it goes up it just misses my elevator
[4:16:58] <CrimsonFox777> 2 minutes til Santa gets back. Everyone back to sleep!
[4:17:05] <+queaks> ITS TIME
[4:17:05] <+OwlLightningMage> Knov's pocket dimension?
[4:17:06] <%ZeOrbling> what was that lol
[4:17:08] <Slim_Lipid> bruh it's a factory who gives a fuck if it looks good 😆 it's all about that EFFIcIENCY
[4:17:11] <+MisterAvry> brrrrr
[4:17:12] <%QueequegTheater> DOOG TIME
[4:17:13] <+queaks> to destroy the envronment!
[4:17:14] <%TheWinged7> RIP AND TEAR
[4:17:16] <feralspidey> Time to get Groovy
[4:17:16] <Profmcstevie> DOOM ETERNAL EVERYDAY
[4:17:17] <%asgard147> nice limesEvil
[4:17:17] <penitentpendant> Groovy
[4:17:18] <+NecDW4> SKIN THEIR ASS RAW
[4:17:19] <+OwlLightningMage> Chainsaw go brrre
[4:17:21] <%TheLemuroid> Chainsaw wowowowow
[4:17:22] <%Broand> Once you make it you don't need to make it again so it's worth it
[4:17:26] <+OwlLightningMage> UNTIL IT'S DONE
[4:17:27] <gryffinp> need so many damn screws
[4:17:27] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt This is a corporate nightmare if you think about it realistically. Every time you achieve your task they just add more responsibilities and leave you with more responsibilites
[4:17:27] <+D00msDayDan> waowaowaowao
[4:17:30] <%Ranryu692> apparently Shaq just got put through a table on AEW
[4:17:32] <+temporaryplaceholder> ha ha chainsaw go brrrrrrr
[4:17:34] <%YakumoYomi> Pat has become Chainsaw Man
[4:17:38] <%Broand> Make a buncha screws
[4:17:41] <penitentpendant> You're low on ammo so it's a good time for it
[4:17:43] <%Puhff> woolieYE
[4:17:45] <%QueequegTheater> @Slim_Lipid The thing is, efficiency IS beauty to pat
[4:17:49] <+queaks> Screws are annoying
[4:17:51] <%blastyoboots> how the fuck do you fit 160 screws in a chainsaw
[4:17:54] <heartlesshealer> screws and reinforced plate you can do this
[4:17:56] <%Broand> Screws are the worse
[4:17:58] <%shurtal> Bloomberg Article says new switch with OLED screen and outputing 4k due by christmas
[4:17:58] <tanklets> Get them splitters man
[4:17:59] <+queaks> They bog up conveyor belts too
[4:18:07] <Slim_Lipid> @Bluwizard21 Is that a nightmare, or just how real life is :)
[4:18:10] <xbb1024> you need to go exploring to get new recipes
[4:18:13] <tanklets> The amount of ore being used isnt efficient
[4:18:15] <cherrycottontail> @blastyoboots the screws are the teeth
[4:18:16] <%Nested_Dreams> Yeah screws are always a fuk
[4:18:17] <%Broand> Screws are the early game big volume resource
[4:18:17] <%holydeviant1> I like to think that ficst engineers go mad when they hit landfall and all of them turn into chainsaw-weilding mass murderers who stuff people into biomass burners
[4:18:20] <$SGrim> @blastyoboots the blades on the chain are actually screws.
[4:18:23] <+queaks> @PatStaresAt Whats the next milestone unlock you think?
[4:18:29] <%Eaglestrike117> Hey im late how is pats mind dealing with this game
[4:18:39] <%Nested_Dreams> Even advanced recipes for screws barely helps
[4:18:39] <heartlesshealer> making screws and then your workbench overheats sucks
[4:18:39] <Profmcstevie> Why would Nintendo chase 4K, that's insane. Just give me my goddamn 60fps you bitches
[4:18:48] <+JumboCrunchies> I think its hitting the right buttons
[4:18:50] <+queaks> @Eaglestrike117 He seems to be really enjoying it from what I can tell
[4:18:51] <tanklets> He is enjoying it I think
[4:18:52] <%Broand> While you wait for your rods to build why not explore the map a little
[4:18:54] <boogaleeboo> and your little space vehicle returns
[4:18:57] <Darthkitten_Prime> @Eaglestrike117 Fantastic, actually. He seems to be loving it so far.
[4:18:59] <%QueequegTheater> Seriously, what is that fucking hanar elephant looking thing
[4:19:01] <CrematedCube> Reacting with glee
[4:19:02] <%Arancet> @Eaglestrike117 its firing off the goblins hard, but in more good ways than bad
[4:19:02] <%blastyoboots> @SGrim @cherrycottontail I guess that checks out
[4:19:04] <+JobbedBone> whats that sound monkaS
[4:19:12] <+TheMorilo> thats a lot of screw
[4:19:18] <%Broand> You have to unlock the map
[4:19:19] <tanklets> Youll get it later
[4:19:23] <+TipsyND> [Yet]
[4:19:24] <+queaks> You need an unlock for map @PatStaresAt
[4:19:24] <tanklets> C to slide man its fast
[4:19:25] <%logoth_> Stop talking about your delicious rods
[4:19:26] <heartlesshealer> @QueequegTheater It's just a creature. Being there. Alive
[4:19:28] <Profmcstevie> Find something cool to level and replace with CONSTRUCTION
[4:19:31] <%Wurmspawn> mapping is another teir of research
[4:19:34] <Rashnam> You need time stop before you can get a map button
[4:19:35] <+queaks> Or a website in another tab
[4:19:35] <penitentpendant> Biomass Road Trip
[4:19:38] <%QueequegTheater> @heartlesshealer but what is it tho
[4:19:43] <%DianaTheAscian> sulfer
[4:19:43] <Manwad> FART ROCKS
[4:19:45] <tanklets> Can hit weird geometry  and send you flying sometimes
[4:19:50] <+ReallyBigRocks> do the slidey jumpy pat
[4:19:50] <boogaleeboo> Basically the game will give you any quality of life thing you'd ever want, eventually
[4:19:52] <%QueequegTheater> Wouldn't pure sulfur be insanely hazardous?
[4:19:55] <%Nested_Dreams> I went for far too long without a map jphFine
[4:19:58] <+TheMorilo> This game is basically Dr Stone
[4:20:00] <+NecDW4> TIME TO PRODUCE YOUR OWN FART GAS! WOOO!
[4:20:05] <Profmcstevie> You see that mountain in the distance? You can destroy it and build over it PridePog
[4:20:06] <xbb1024> You don't need Sulfur until much later
[4:20:12] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt that suit doesn't protect for shit
[4:20:12] <heartlesshealer> @QueequegTheater I haven't seen a name for it yet, but all I know is that it's the non-aggressive creature
[4:20:19] <%notsoy> quartz
[4:20:21] <gryffinp> lies, you need sulfur immediately
[4:20:21] <+D00msDayDan> you know what your space suit isn't immune to? nuclear radiation
[4:20:22] <moosemonkey397> quartz? fuck i dont even remember that existing
[4:20:24] <+OwlLightningMage> Your massive hips protect you from sulfur damage
[4:20:26] <+Malarix> hey pat, have you played factorio? if you have, how do you think this game compares? been thinking about trying one of them
[4:20:28] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Only hazardous for bitches, and we aint no bitches
[4:20:31] <%notsoy> do you have anything you can make with quartz or sulfur yet?
[4:20:33] <+queaks> Flower pedals allow you to recolor your factory eventually
[4:20:39] <tanklets> Wont need quartz til computers
[4:20:42] <%Broand> LOOK GLOWY THING
[4:20:46] <tanklets> Enemy
[4:20:47] <moosemonkey397> XD
[4:20:49] <+queaks> OH DANG
[4:20:52] <heartlesshealer> oh right crush 'em for pigment
[4:20:54] <gryffinp> oh shit he didn't bring the stick
[4:20:54] <+OwlLightningMage> MONSTER
[4:20:55] <tanklets> Ready to get bonked
[4:20:58] <%XeroSigmaPrime> This looks more fun than factorio
[4:20:59] <CappuccinoGuil> RUN BITCH
[4:21:01] <CappuccinoGuil> he ded
[4:21:02] <Profmcstevie> We have explored the world, it hate us we're leaving
[4:21:05] <tanklets> Getting chased
[4:21:06] <penitentpendant> Picturing pat dancing through a flower field, picking it clean, next panel he's dumping it into a furnace, "Power... I need MOAR POWER."
[4:21:10] <%AzureGale> GIEF
[4:21:10] <Dreigun> oh no, fatty pig alien
[4:21:10] <+D00msDayDan> you need to build the MAM to research stuff with quartz and sulphur
[4:21:14] <CappuccinoGuil> Did they fix the aggro rnage?
[4:21:18] <tanklets> lmao
[4:21:20] <%Dunmarkh> psaBlind
[4:21:21] <heartlesshealer> Remember they're super fast
[4:21:25] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Do I get this game? Or Factorio?
[4:21:29] <+D00msDayDan> @penitentpendant the hills are alive with the sound of B I O F U E L
[4:21:30] <moosemonkey397> once you get the fiurst ranged weapon sht gets less scary
[4:21:33] <+OwlLightningMage> This game is corporate Vergil simulator
[4:21:40] <tanklets> I like this one a lot more than factorio
[4:21:43] <%Cybercobra2> @XeroSigmaPrime depends what you are after. factorio has the whole player VS enviroment thing. where this game all the enemies just stay by their spawn and you are never bothered
[4:21:44] <penitentpendant> @D00msDayDan Perfect
[4:21:46] <%notsoy> screws in storage
[4:21:51] <%blastyoboots> you had a ton of rods in there too
[4:21:51] <CappuccinoGuil> You have rods in the chest
[4:21:53] <heartlesshealer> yeah don't explore without your weapon dealie
[4:21:54] <Tuna_Can_0> @XeroSigmaPrime to each their own. They're both pretty different, I like factorio more imo
[4:21:54] <LVL1_Scumbag> and rods
[4:21:54] <%notsoy> and a bunch of rods
[4:22:01] <%notsoy> RODS IN STORAGE
[4:22:06] <+queaks> You need biofuel to power chainsaw
[4:22:09] <heartlesshealer> IT'S TIME
[4:22:10] <moosemonkey397> needs gass
[4:22:11] <tanklets> Chainsaw needs biomass
[4:22:17] <Manwad> @XeroSigmaPrime This game has a better presentation, Factorio has so much more content via mods and being complete
[4:22:20] <heartlesshealer> fuel tho
[4:22:21] <%DianaTheAscian> oh no
[4:22:23] <Profmcstevie> Factorio seems more enthusiast oriented to me, while Satisfactory has more general satisfaction
[4:22:23] <blue8moon> NotLikeThis
[4:22:28] <+TheMorilo> LUL
[4:22:29] <penitentpendant> I feel that chainsaw animation is a reference to a chainsaw animation of another game
[4:22:30] <+ReallyBigRocks> @PatStaresAt you can use any fuel
[4:22:30] <heartlesshealer> 8)
[4:22:32] <%blastyoboots> holy crap you get the Doom weapon-acquisition examining
[4:22:35] <%notsoy> yeah that TOTALLY isn't the doom chainsaw animation lmao
[4:22:36] <+D00msDayDan> the chainsaw has an AOE around your body that can also destroy rocks
[4:22:46] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt pretty sure if you hold control and left click you can move multiple stacks of the same item between storage
[4:22:47] <Manwad> he's gonna rip and tear nature
[4:22:51] <%Cybercobra2> @ReallyBigRocks no, it has to be solid biofuel or better
[4:22:57] <+queaks> @PatStaresAt If you kill an enemy with a chainsaw do you get ammo?
[4:23:00] <s1rcuit> that's correct
[4:23:03] <CappuccinoGuil> Pretty much, yeah
[4:23:03] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Yep
[4:23:10] <%Broand> Yeah and feed wood or leaves into a constructor prior
[4:23:10] <heartlesshealer> ye
[4:23:12] <+ReallyBigRocks> @Cybercobra2 oh yeah I'm dumb
[4:23:18] <Profmcstevie> Lets go chainsaw that thing that growled at us coneyWOKE
[4:23:19] <kingmemelord97> hey chat
[4:23:20] <gryffinp> Yeah, you'll still have to manually take the fuel out of the constructor/storage container and put it in the burner
[4:23:21] <gryffinp> but it works
[4:23:23] <Griffin1171> and set up two constructors to dump wood and leaves into for biomass
[4:23:27] <%blastyoboots> that is why you automate it
[4:23:29] <%Dunmarkh> gotta automate
[4:23:30] <$Afterman_> i cant believe strive got delayed to june @PatStaresAt
[4:23:32] <penitentpendant> Smells like an excuse for ANOTHER ASSEMBLY LINE
[4:23:33] <Tuna_Can_0> brrrrrrrrr
[4:23:35] <+TheBobulus> lol, held down the button too long, it's getting warm
[4:23:36] <+ReallyBigRocks> Yeah, leaves and wood to biofuel to biomass
[4:23:42] <+queaks> Time to kill tree
[4:23:42] <%KingPelleas> KingPelleas subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! Yay, two months! Enjoy letting the creative juices flow Pat.
[4:23:43] <heartlesshealer> oh wait is it auto-using the biofuel you're making because you're holding the chainsaw?
[4:23:44] <%QueequegTheater> @Afterman_ he saw
[4:23:45] <NitronStreams> Remember, you're here forever
[4:23:49] <Profmcstevie> Satisfactory is do things till you hate it, then automate it
[4:23:49] <+BusterRepukken> Strive comes out the same day as Ratchet and Clank now.
[4:23:51] <%Broand> Uses fuel when cutting stuff, cuts trees in an AoE
[4:24:01] <%Cybercobra2> FUCK YOU NATURE
[4:24:01] <$Afterman_> @QueequegTheater figured. was just saying it here too. fucking sucks lmao.
[4:24:07] <+queaks> @PatStaresAt How efficient is biofuel in the burner
[4:24:18] <LorcaNomad> many plant
[4:24:22] <+ReallyBigRocks> Time to deforest the planet
[4:24:23] <blue8moon> kill all the trees
[4:24:25] <penitentpendant> Let the Clear Cutting... BEGIN
[4:24:26] <Profmcstevie> Now to find a forest
[4:24:26] <%notsoy> THAT'S RAD
[4:24:27] <NitronStreams> Trees are no match for me now!
[4:24:34] <%QueequegTheater> AOE Kreygasm
[4:24:34] <Tuna_Can_0> now way chainsaws cut trees PogChamp
[4:24:37] <s1rcuit> not if you chainsaw them
[4:24:37] <Griffin1171> no
[4:24:40] <+queaks> Trees dont grow back
[4:24:41] <gryffinp> Trees do not grow back
[4:24:42] <%Broand> Note: this'll eat REAL BIG TREES
[4:24:45] <sendart> Glory to the machine
[4:24:47] <heartlesshealer> guess
[4:24:47] <zazzera01> nope. destroy the enviornment!
[4:24:50] <Saltmeisterr> YEYEYE CHAINSAW
[4:24:50] <boogaleeboo> Bushes do
[4:24:53] <%QueequegTheater> CLEAR CUT THE WORLD
[4:24:56] <%blastyoboots> find BIG TREE
[4:24:57] <boogaleeboo> and flowers
[4:24:58] <+queaks> The WHOLE planet pat
[4:24:59] <heartlesshealer> trees take years to grow
[4:25:00] <%crimsonharvest> get the BIIIIG ones
[4:25:02] <Profmcstevie> Can we replenish trees
[4:25:03] <+ReallyBigRocks> It's okay there's more than enough trees
[4:25:06] <+TheMorilo> big tree
[4:25:06] <heartlesshealer> shrubs are whatever
[4:25:07] <Tuna_Can_0> MURDER ALL TREES
[4:25:07] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt you'll get more sustainable fuel sources later
[4:25:08] <CrematedCube> Sadly no, ironically plants are the true non-renewable
[4:25:09] <%notsoy> cut BIG tree
[4:25:09] <CappuccinoGuil> Don't worry about it, you'll get infinite fuel later
[4:25:12] <CrimsonFox777> Gotta make space for industry and production.
[4:25:13] <penitentpendant> Rip and Tear UNTIL IT IS PROCESSED
[4:25:33] <%tank7013> @PatStaresAt You can destroy nut and berry plants and the chainsaw has a small aoe so watch out for that
[4:25:36] <Profmcstevie> The only thing they fear is you (Trees Version)
[4:25:38] <%QueequegTheater> FIGHT NATURE
[4:25:43] <Megalofyte> the chainsaw cuts down groups of stuff in an aoe, and can for some reason indirectly kill rocks too
[4:25:44] <penitentpendant> Time to become the villain in Ferngully
[4:25:46] <+traximus_s> just showed up is pat enjoying this game?
[4:25:54] <%Broken_Sonex> Make sure it's a REAL OLD TREE.
[4:25:55] <Manwad> ORB
[4:25:56] <hat_under_bread> The delicate touch of humankind has arrived.
[4:25:57] <%TheWinged7> fire lizards
[4:26:00] <%shruke> oh i love the chainsaw
[4:26:01] <gryffinp> that's a collectible and its custodes
[4:26:03] <heartlesshealer> HAVE FUN
[4:26:04] <feralspidey> it's a mind goblin

[4:26:05] <%Broand> CHAINSAW ISNT WEAPON
[4:26:05] <+queaks> Chainsaw no kill monsters
[4:26:06] <+vaderxyz1970> Guardians of the forest
[4:26:06] <GelatinFellow> CHAINSAW NOT A WEAPON
[4:26:06] <+ReallyBigRocks> chainsaw no work on aliems
[4:26:06] <Tuna_Can_0> ORB GET
[4:26:07] <xbb1024> you can't chain saw them yet
[4:26:07] <CappuccinoGuil> Chainsaw doesn't hurt them!
[4:26:08] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt can't chainsaw them
[4:26:08] <gryffinp> the chainsaw is NOT a weapon do not attempt to use it as one
[4:26:10] <+EmotionalFatGuy> this isn't doom
[4:26:11] <%TheWinged7> you cant rip and tear
[4:26:12] <xbb1024> in this build
[4:26:14] <+temporaryplaceholder> CHAINSAW IT UNTIL IT STOPS RESISTING
[4:26:14] <%AzureGale> I think you entered a Sanctum level
[4:26:14] <+TheMorilo> ano
[4:26:16] <$Afterman_> punch to death
[4:26:17] <+TipsyND> You came to the wrong neightborhood motherfucker
[4:26:18] <$Trenr> you cannot rip and tear the enemies with chainsaw, sadly
[4:26:19] <%Nested_Dreams> Chainsaw is not a weapon
[4:26:19] <+panlakes> I just came back, glad it didnt turn into a just chatting stream in the end
[4:26:19] <NitronStreams> You are NOT Doomguy
[4:26:21] <%tank7013> Unfortunately no
[4:26:22] <%Dunmarkh> that's bullshit
[4:26:23] <$Dakuu75> this is DOOM, Pat
[4:26:24] <+queaks> Please dont misuse your chainsaw
[4:26:26] <%Broand> don't mind the orb
[4:26:26] <feralspidey> 0/10, no doom slaying
[4:26:27] <%QueequegTheater> Chop down the tree to spite them
[4:26:27] <%Broken_Sonex> Well that's stupid.
[4:26:27] <penitentpendant> Nature is defending itself? HOW DARE!?
[4:26:31] <heartlesshealer> chainsaw is a tool
[4:26:32] <+temporaryplaceholder> That is 100% bullshit
[4:26:33] <%notsoy> chainsaw not being a weapon is fucking lame
[4:26:36] <%whyskeywolfe> Kill it Pat, kill it with your mighty gubbinz
[4:26:41] <heartlesshealer> HIDE IN THE GLOWING FOG
[4:26:42] <boogaleeboo> Taze his balls
[4:26:46] <Megalofyte> you need the gun for those Avondale
[4:26:50] <Profmcstevie> I'm sure the excuse is "chainsaw blade can't cut through their armour"
[4:26:53] <+RealMichaelPhelps> OH SHIT OH FUCK
[4:26:55] <+OwlLightningMage> Early Access
[4:26:56] <Megalofyte> *animals
[4:27:01] <%Monkeyweed21> Chainsaws make terrible weapons BTW
[4:27:01] <smuggleruncle> murder goes down
[4:27:03] <heartlesshealer> (I'm being an ass don't hide in the fog)
[4:27:03] <%Nested_Dreams> Don't worry, guns later once coal is in play
[4:27:05] <$Dakuu75> GRAB HIS DICK AND TAZE IT
[4:27:07] <+queaks> @PatStaresAt Using a chainsaw will also clear any nearby leaves
[4:27:17] <%notsoy> 40 wood wow
[4:27:19] <%Broken_Sonex> You should totally be able to kill those things with a chainsaw. Kinda bullshit.
[4:27:23] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt the chainsaw acts like an aoe, harvesting all plant matter around you
[4:27:24] <+D00msDayDan> the chainsaw has a huge aoe so use it in the middle of a bunch of plants
[4:27:27] <%logoth_> How does he run so fast with a chainsaw
[4:27:28] <+ReallyBigRocks> you just gotta get choppin man
[4:27:29] <%logoth_> look at him go
[4:27:31] <boogaleeboo> You have like an hour of power on you right now
[4:27:33] <%Broand> The early game power system? yeah
[4:27:36] <blastazoid00> @PatStaresAt How are you liking the game so far?
[4:27:36] <%notsoy> can't wait for the next update to make the chainsaw kill shit
[4:27:37] <+TheBobulus> that's why you rush to coal and then you can automate the entire power process
[4:27:38] <+ReallyBigRocks> wood also makes WAY more biomass than leaves
[4:27:42] <s1rcuit> it can also work on small rocks for some reason
[4:27:45] <heartlesshealer> gotta use your claw to fight for now
[4:27:46] <+JobbedBone> you just need a network of conveyors across the entire map that leads back to your base :)
[4:27:46] <+OwlLightningMage> Chainsaw is fireball
[4:27:51] <$Dakuu75> we have all this dumb industrial shit but we can't make guns or bombs???
[4:28:08] <%Broand> you can
[4:28:10] <gryffinp> who said you can't make guns or bobms
[4:28:13] <%Broand> just not now
[4:28:14] <s1rcuit> @Dakuu75 eventually
[4:28:16] <+FlongBongle> Wth is this
[4:28:19] <heartlesshealer> company has not given milestone permission for pat to make guns yet
[4:28:19] <CrematedCube> oh you can make guns and bombs later
[4:28:28] <%Broand> No
[4:28:29] <+ReallyBigRocks> nope
[4:28:29] <$Trenr> nope
[4:28:30] <gryffinp> no
[4:28:31] <+queaks> Nope
[4:28:32] <KShirahama> no
[4:28:32] <CappuccinoGuil> No
[4:28:33] <$Trenr> burners are all manual
[4:28:34] <Tisaric> nope
[4:28:34] <+EmotionalFatGuy> not that one
[4:28:35] <zazzera01> no unfortunately
[4:28:35] <%Broand> its fed by hand and it's dum
[4:28:37] <+EmotionalFatGuy> one later
[4:28:40] <+D00msDayDan> no automated input on biomass, you can't automate power until coal
[4:28:42] <+queaks> You want to move on from biomass burners ASAP
[4:28:42] <+BusterRepukken> early access game
[4:28:44] <gryffinp> little bit bullshit yeah
[4:28:45] <%tank7013> Yea it kinda is
[4:28:46] <%Dunmarkh> this game certainly has guns godamn
[4:28:47] <GelatinFellow> better rush to coal then ;)
[4:28:50] <%Broand> yes it is bullshit
[4:28:51] <+queaks> They suck honestly
[4:28:52] <KShirahama> put it into nerby storage
[4:28:52] <Tuna_Can_0> atpFeelsBeardMan
[4:28:53] <xbb1024> that's why you progress to coal as fast as possible
[4:28:54] <blastazoid00> LUL
[4:28:56] <$Dakuu75> ominous, lmao
[4:29:00] <CrematedCube> Load it as full as you can and deal with it
[4:29:00] <heartlesshealer> that's also bullshit
[4:29:03] <%Wurmspawn> Coal power will have input. You just have to get that far tech wise.
[4:29:05] <EvanDude47> coal is the first power source you can conveyor into
[4:29:15] <penitentpendant> Create Biofuel while you think?
[4:29:16] <+D00msDayDan> the solution is to build a shitload more biomass burners than you need and stuff them all with solid biofuel so you don't have to worry about it for a while
[4:29:17] <CappuccinoGuil> Give them biofuel
[4:29:23] <heartlesshealer> time to convert half that wood you harvested
[4:29:24] <%DiscoMatador> Reject Biomass Progress to COAL
[4:29:26] <%tank7013> You're gonna wanna rush the hell outta coal
[4:29:26] <gryffinp> @PatStaresAt Perhaps you could think while turning biomass into solid fuel
[4:29:26] <+queaks> If you fill each with biomass that will last 30 minutes
[4:29:27] <+JobbedBone> chainsaw is to encourage you to explore
[4:29:36] <Tuna_Can_0> NotLikeThis brain overheating
[4:29:42] <+MisterAvry> oh nice
[4:29:53] <Griffin1171> HE'S GOT IT
[4:29:57] <+MisterAvry> double doubled
[4:29:59] <gryffinp> I see, this is the mobile kind of thinking
[4:30:03] <+ReallyBigRocks> Crate > Biomass constructor > Crate > Biofuel constructor
[4:30:05] <heartlesshealer> and they need power
[4:30:06] <%Monkeyweed21> just do it by hand @PatStaresAt
[4:30:09] <penitentpendant> Planning Stage Complete!
[4:30:09] <+MisterAvry> "he's starting to believe"
[4:30:28] <%Wurmspawn> And that's if you don't want to use both wood and leaves for create biomass because constructors will only convert one or the other at a time.
[4:30:28] <%blastyoboots> yep, two constructors for biomass, one for biofuel, and lead them into a storage container so you can pick it up and dump them wherever you need them to manually get burned
[4:30:30] <CrematedCube> You can build a stand alone building for it now with a separate power supply
[4:30:34] <%Jekado> oh boy the bio mass conversion takes so much
[4:30:37] <heartlesshealer> gonna have to head out to do deliveries, keep having fun!
[4:30:39] <+JobbedBone> these pipes Kreygasm are cleeeeeaan
[4:30:39] <+queaks> Can you see how this game is fun with friends? @PatStaresAt
[4:30:42] <%dj_xo98> !uptime
[4:30:43] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 31m.
[4:31:10] <%Nested_Dreams> Goodnight, no more backseating from me, if the early game tedium is too much I recommend multiplayer
[4:31:18] <+vaderxyz1970> Is satisfactory on sale anywhere?
[4:31:24] <%Broand> Foundations?
[4:31:43] <%Broand> it's getting an update so it might go on sale in a couple of weeks
[4:31:52] <%Nested_Dreams> Cause you can have a guy on fuel duty and a guy on factory duty
[4:31:56] <NitronStreams> looks like the time to tear everything down and restart is getting closer
[4:32:01] <%Ranryu692> Ranryu692 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 33 months! With some sports teams allowing fans back into arenas, the Milwaukee Bucks basketball team has replaced its Kiss Cam with a Hand Sanitizer Cam, which features an animated bottle of hand sanitizer squirting onto people. It's at least as bad as it sounds
[4:32:08] <%Broand> get your foundations unlocked
[4:32:49] <%Ranryu692> @vaderxyz1970 it's on Steam early access
[4:32:50] <+queaks> @PatStaresAt I wouldnt bother with solid biofuel, biomass is more than good enough
[4:32:54] <NitronStreams> the goblins are angry
[4:32:58] <PrishKitla> time to burn it down
[4:32:59] <+ReallyBigRocks> You can just slap some more poles down
[4:33:06] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> This game is real neat.
[4:33:18] <+OwlLightningMage> Power is the storm that is approaching
[4:33:27] <+ReallyBigRocks> Youve got tons of biomass tho
[4:33:34] <CappuccinoGuil> Put some biofuel in the mass burners?
[4:33:45] <akitanito> Just jj-j-jam it in!
[4:33:49] <%AzureGale> B I O  M A S S
[4:34:15] <xbb1024> all the biomass jam!
[4:34:16] <zazzera01> the hub's burners aren't as efficient as the bigger ones
[4:34:18] <NitronStreams> 👏👏👏
[4:34:22] <+ReallyBigRocks> you're on the clock now
[4:34:33] <%AzureGale> Just jam in your biomass >:D
[4:34:42] <gryffinp> ehhhh it's not so much about efficiency in terms of fuel as maximum capacity
[4:34:45] <%AzureGale> Watch out for more biomass :3
[4:34:46] <gryffinp> power efficiency is WEIRD in this game
[4:34:53] <+ReallyBigRocks> well no cuz the big one doesn't make enough power on it's own
[4:34:55] <+queaks> You are using 35, each burner makes 30
[4:34:57] <%blastyoboots> I think you need MORE big ones
[4:34:57] <s1rcuit> the difference is 10mw
[4:34:58] <BwdYeti> The efficiency is the same, the hub ones just burn it slower
[4:34:58] <%Broand> uh not sure about th-
[4:35:02] <xbb1024> you still need all of them
[4:35:09] <+D00msDayDan> a full stack of solid biofuel is a lot of power
[4:35:35] <CappuccinoGuil> You gotta make sure your energy capacity is higher than your consumption
[4:35:40] <+ReallyBigRocks> yeah
[4:35:43] <+queaks> You only need one of the base burners right now
[4:35:48] <%ironohki> Is Pat being creative?
[4:36:10] <+queaks> Handmake plates
[4:36:14] <gryffinp> @PatStaresAt the rate at which biofuel is consumed is reduced when you're not drawing 100% of the capacity of the generators, so having more reacors hooked up splits the drain across all of them
[4:36:16] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt control leftclick should move everything at once
[4:36:20] <+queaks> You have lots of ingots
[4:36:23] <+ReallyBigRocks> @queaks having excess power means they burn fuel slower so it doesn't really matter
[4:36:52] <+ReallyBigRocks> you will only accumulate more garbage
[4:36:55] <xbb1024> once you get splitters and mergers, you may want to think about input/output speeds and optimisation
[4:36:57] <+queaks> @ReallyBigRocks Pretty sure thats how it works in the next update. Currently excess power is wasted
[4:37:06] <%Broand> push the endorphin button
[4:37:08] <BwdYeti> pchooooo
[4:37:10] <+Fooguwu> Pat im proud of you for challenging yourself and growing ♥
[4:37:13] <JackaxeAM> Is he enjoying the factory-building?
[4:37:18] <%ironohki> into space
[4:37:25] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> The GRID is your friend.
[4:37:29] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> The GRID keeps you safe.
[4:37:29] <+MisterAvry> team rocket blah blah blah
[4:37:29] <gryffinp> @queaks exactly the opposite, right NOW excess power is not wasted, after update 4 it will be EXCEPT for biomass burners
[4:37:34] <NitronStreams> TIME TO TEAR IT ALL DOWN
[4:37:35] <+TheBobulus> Excited for foundations! :D
[4:37:35] <+queaks> Foundations = Lots of concrete
[4:37:36] <%blastyoboots> I have **GOT** to play this shit but I'm too busy watching Pat play it
[4:37:37] <%Broand> Tab
[4:37:54] <BwdYeti> You're going to want more space
[4:37:56] <+queaks> Yuuuuup
[4:37:56] <zazzera01> yuuup
[4:37:57] <%DiscoMatador> YEP
[4:37:58] <xbb1024> this is why you need the taller ones
[4:37:58] <gryffinp> oh yes.
[4:37:58] <s1rcuit> this may upset some goblins
[4:37:59] <Zaphire_Saucypants> @blastyoboots same.
[4:38:00] <Visorak6> Hell yeah you are
[4:38:02] <%notsoy> need a fuck-ton of concrete
[4:38:02] <+ReallyBigRocks> Concrete thirst begins now
[4:38:03] <penitentpendant> Start laying out the foundation for your super factory elsewhere
[4:38:04] <KShirahama> yuup
[4:38:05] <CappuccinoGuil> You're gonna need a FUCKING LOT of it
[4:38:07] <gryffinp> so much concrete
[4:38:07] <%Broand> Where you place the first foundation will decide where the grid is
[4:38:10] <akitanito> How much resource is refunded when you destroy a building?
[4:38:11] <+TheBobulus> @PatStaresAt Might be a good time to put some stuff on your shortcut bar. If I remember right, it's hit the number when you're moused over the item in the build menu?
[4:38:15] <+queaks> Maybe time to split the belt into more maunfacturers @PatStaresAt
[4:38:24] <CrematedCube> Yes, I recommend 5x5 or 6x6 at a time
[4:38:24] <%Broand> Look at your concrete miner for a second?
[4:38:31] <+ReallyBigRocks> @akitanito 100%
[4:38:32] <KShirahama> @akitanito all
[4:38:33] <+TipsyND> @akitanito All
[4:38:36] <%Broand> The belts
[4:38:45] <+JobbedBone> just have a bunch of small factories with one central powerplant
[4:38:45] <+queaks> 30 per minute
[4:38:53] <%Broand> Ok so the production is being matched by your crafter, ok
[4:38:56] <+queaks> That means you are at most making 30 concrete per minute
[4:39:03] <+queaks> You should find a better concrete node
[4:39:09] <+Shackle_Rustyford> im so stoked that pat is into this
[4:39:19] <+ChampionBob> *more concrete nodes
[4:39:22] <+Shackle_Rustyford> this might literally be his creativity neurosis goblin slayer
[4:39:23] <+ChampionBob> just use ALL the nodes!
[4:39:24] <%AimlessStranger> So is the goal here to consume the planet and leave with all its resources?
[4:39:32] <+queaks> Better or more
[4:39:32] <+BusterRepukken> either better nodes or just more nodes.
[4:39:32] <gryffinp> actually less than 30 per minute, much much less, since three limestone is used for one concrete
[4:39:33] <Veluren> Normal or pure, if that node is impure the distance would make up for itself
[4:39:34] <+queaks> Hopefully both
[4:39:36] <gryffinp> but yes. get more limestone
[4:39:38] <s1rcuit> Zap those xenos
[4:39:38] <%blastyoboots> Do the impure nodes give different amounts per second??
[4:39:40] <%notsoy> this was near the hostile animals at the forest
[4:39:40] <%shruke> this would be a good time to explore and maybe choose a base spot closer to some good nodes
[4:39:53] <%blastyoboots> like can two impure nodes be different??
[4:39:59] <@commanderclaw> The doggo has speed lines
[4:40:01] <+queaks> Zoomies
[4:40:02] <PrishKitla> kill it!!
[4:40:02] <xbb1024> yeah, kill all the native wildlife
[4:40:04] <%Ranryu692> they're zoomin!
[4:40:08] <NitronStreams> Look at these zoomers
[4:40:08] <+Fooguwu> DEJA VU
[4:40:08] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Pure might give more concrete than you can run on one MK1 belt.
[4:40:08] <+D00msDayDan> the nodes miners go on are always regular, pure is for what you mine by hand
[4:40:11] <%Puhff> ZOOMIE ZOOM
[4:40:12] <+queaks> Its impure
[4:40:12] <GelatinFellow> @AimlessStranger The goal is to take the resources and create materials for some kind of "project assembly" then shoot them into space via space elevator
[4:40:13] <+TheMorilo> why did they put mobs in this game
[4:40:13] <akitanito> The running looks ridiculous lol
[4:40:14] <EuropanLamprey> SPEED LINES
[4:40:19] <KShirahama> yes
[4:40:21] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> No this is better
[4:40:24] <+queaks> Normal is 60 per minute
[4:40:24] <+ReallyBigRocks> SLIDE JUMP to go faster
[4:40:24] <%blastyoboots> oh it's Impure, NORMAL, and Pure
[4:40:29] <+JobbedBone> isn't the distance irrelevant as long as the conveyor belt is saturated?
[4:40:31] <%tank7013> @blastyoboots Only if they have different levels of miner.
[4:40:32] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> No, normal is fine.
[4:40:32] <%Puhff> yeah
[4:40:33] <%Broand> I think the first one is impure
[4:40:42] <gryffinp> @TheMorilo to soft-gate world progress through unlocking offensive and exploration tools
[4:40:44] <+queaks> Pure = 90 per minute. Normal is 60 and impure is 30
[4:40:44] <BwdYeti> You actually don't have a mining rig strong enough to use pure right now
[4:40:46] <$Dakuu75> @PatStaresAt what if you made a bridge out of conveyor-belts. to walk faster? would that work
[4:40:50] <+ReallyBigRocks> Normal will produce 60/s
[4:41:03] <xbb1024> it affects extraction rates. impure is half, pure is double
[4:41:09] <$Stari> Pure = 90 per minute. Normal is 60 and impure is 30
[4:41:09] <zazzera01> you can slide jump to go faster
[4:41:11] <+ChampionBob> Pure is 120/m
[4:41:13] <+Brightstreak> omg I'm so glad you're finally checking out this game. this is so up your alley
[4:41:21] <+ReallyBigRocks> well don't just get rid of it
[4:41:21] <+ChampionBob> I thought
[4:41:24] <%Broand> uh
[4:41:25] <+TheMorilo> @gryffinp I'm convinced now
[4:41:26] <+Brightstreak> I've played obscene.amojnts of this game
[4:41:38] <Megalofyte> the starting zone of the map has few pure sources of ore
[4:41:43] <%tank7013> Impure halves what the miner can produce, pure doubles it
[4:41:45] <%Broand> There's two impures there?
[4:41:50] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> I don't think pure will do anything for you at this point.
[4:41:52] <%blastyoboots> Miner MK1 can't mine pure they said
[4:41:59] <%Broand> it IS fancy
[4:41:59] <s1rcuit> @Brightstreak you're link's broken
[4:42:01] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Your conveyor belts are 60 items/s, right?
[4:42:07] <BwdYeti> @PatStaresAt at this point in the game normal and pure give the same amount, your drills aren't strong enough
[4:42:09] <+queaks> PAUNCH
[4:42:16] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> So it produces more than your belts can run.
[4:42:18] <+EmotionalFatGuy> glory to the power slugs
[4:42:19] <%DianaTheAscian> damn
[4:42:19] <gryffinp> why are you people lying to pat
[4:42:21] <+queaks> Normal it is
[4:42:24] <+JobbedBone> it would still double your production
[4:42:26] <+TheMorilo> LUL
[4:42:28] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> It's not a bad thing to find, but you're only getting half of what you could.
[4:42:30] <+ReallyBigRocks> yeah production is capped at 60/s until you get better conveyors
[4:42:32] <+JobbedBone> to have two
[4:42:32] <%notsoy> can the entire deposit be pure, or just the little chunks?
[4:42:35] <+queaks> Normal is more than enough to get started
[4:42:46] <gryffinp> The scanner pings the nearest three things, no matter how near or far
[4:42:48] <chaosbringer28> the scanner only marks the 3 nearest nodes
[4:42:52] <s1rcuit> nah, that thing can detect resource nodes as far as 2km
[4:42:52] <%tank7013> You can't utilize pure yet anyway because your belts can't carry enough to support it
[4:42:54] <%Broand> Entire deposits can be pure, but you can feed two assemblers off of a normal one
[4:43:00] <%Broand> making 1 concrete a second
[4:43:13] <invalid_robin> How is this game with the goblins?
[4:43:28] <+JobbedBone> you dropped them on the ground
[4:43:28] <+Brightstreak> pure/impure just refers to the rate of extraction.
[4:43:31] <%QueequegTheater> LUL
[4:43:31] <+JobbedBone> inventory was full?
[4:43:33] <+TipsyND> Inventory full
[4:43:35] <+MrJackett> You ran out of space and left materials on round
[4:43:38] <%Broand> Oh was your inventory full
[4:43:46] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt you're inventory was full and left the materials behind in a crate
[4:43:48] <%messentry> messentry subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! 
[4:43:48] <%TheWinged7> LUL
[4:43:49] <+queaks> Yay inventory shinnanigans
[4:43:50] <zazzera01> full inventory drops things in a crate where you disassembled it
[4:43:50] <+ReallyBigRocks> the struggle
[4:43:57] <xbb1024> Now you're thinking with logistics!
[4:43:58] <%blastyoboots> you picked up all the junk from your crate and never put it down
[4:44:01] <celysus> If you hold C while running, you slide. try slide jumping to move faster :O
[4:44:02] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt This is Yoshi-P's fault somehow
[4:44:04] <gryffinp> maybe rebuild that one miner on the nearby node and just make a new one on the other
[4:44:04] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt the stuff's near the cliff
[4:44:10] <+queaks> Mind full like inventory
[4:44:11] <penitentpendant> Resident Evil flashbacks, CURSE YOU LIMITED INVENTORY
[4:44:32] <%TheWinged7> make some storage crates
[4:44:34] <%Jekado> keep the wires and cables!
[4:44:39] <+JobbedBone> its like terraria; just add more chests LUL
[4:44:49] <+queaks> Dropped concrete
[4:45:00] <akitanito> The stacks are so limited...
[4:45:00] <NitronStreams> Pain.
[4:45:03] <gryffinp> need some jump pads
[4:45:03] <%Puhff> KEKW
[4:45:12] <EuropanLamprey> Does this game have the equivalent of a Shuckler Box chat?
[4:45:18] <%notsoy> jump pads or ramps would help a lot
[4:45:24] <+Brightstreak> red berries heal you
[4:45:28] <celysus> you can also slide-jump with C
[4:45:39] <%Puhff> hopefully you'll unlock timestop soon Keepo
[4:45:40] <+queaks> Like different types?
[4:45:40] <s1rcuit> honestly I don't think jump pads are worth it
[4:45:41] <GelatinFellow> Many
[4:45:47] <%Dunmarkh> at least 4
[4:45:49] <+queaks> Probably ~20-30
[4:45:51] <HomasxualBatman> This is the last kind of game i'd expect to see you playin but looks cool
[4:45:54] <Visorak6> cant wait until you're fucking with antimatter or some shit
[4:45:57] <%notsoy> someone's going to mod in disassembling inefficiency, and that person should be slapped
[4:45:58] <gryffinp> oh that's weird
[4:46:02] <gryffinp> I've never noticed that
[4:46:08] <+TipsyND> Many, and they are adding gas in two weeks.
[4:46:10] <%CommanderSqueaks> LUL
[4:46:16] <NitronStreams> The Clearance
[4:46:18] <+queaks> Theres still stuff on the node
[4:46:20] <%Jekado> chop off the top
[4:46:22] <+ReallyBigRocks> Theres chunks you have to break i think
[4:46:22] <gryffinp> something's blocking it
[4:46:22] <+JobbedBone> hmm
[4:46:23] <+Brightstreak> pick up copper ore
[4:46:24] <celysus> there's a rock there
[4:46:25] <gryffinp> check for more rocks
[4:46:25] <KShirahama> rock in middle?
[4:46:25] <zazzera01> break the rock first?
[4:46:28] <%Jekado> there is something on the node
[4:46:28] <xbb1024> rotate it
[4:46:28] <+JobbedBone> a box?
[4:46:28] <+Brightstreak> there's ore on the node
[4:46:28] <CappuccinoGuil> there's crap there
[4:46:29] <EuropanLamprey> What about Roads and Vehicles?  Surely there is a way to transport yourself and materials long range
[4:46:32] <+JobbedBone> oh
[4:46:32] <%notsoy> other chunks to break off
[4:46:36] <+Brightstreak> no the copper
[4:46:41] <+Brightstreak> not limestone
[4:46:43] <%CommanderSqueaks> More copper
[4:46:45] <Tuna_Can_0> monkaS ghost player
[4:46:49] <+Brightstreak> nope I was wrong..my bad
[4:46:49] <%DorianCreed> The copper you ginger fuck
[4:46:56] <NitronStreams> Oh thank goodness
[4:47:01] <CappuccinoGuil> @EuropanLamprey there is. The map is MASSIVE, transportation is a must
[4:47:04] <penitentpendant> It worked!
[4:47:15] <akitanito> Magic
[4:47:17] <s1rcuit> y'all need to chill, it's his first time playing
[4:47:23] <%Jekado> the best part is you can cover nodes with concrete and still mine from them
[4:47:23] <gryffinp> its a bit of a run yeah
[4:47:24] <%DianaTheAscian> its finnnneeee
[4:47:26] <%Fooguwu> Fooguwu subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 13 months! Hi Pat-a-rick proud of you for challenging yourself! Hope to see more creative games in the future. And when in doubt remember that the way our senses interpret reality is completely arbitrary and so objective reality is necessarily totally different! hth
[4:47:27] <+BusterRepukken> maybe its time to move the factory or at least soon
[4:47:28] <%TheWinged7> have fun getting power & conveyors out there
[4:47:28] <+Brightstreak> why not the limestone near your base?
[4:47:29] <%DorianCreed> MANY power pole
[4:47:30] <+D00msDayDan> you can build tractors, trucks and trains
[4:47:32] <%notsoy> i hope you have a lot of plates lmao
[4:47:33] <CappuccinoGuil> "That's SO far" oh Pat, you're ADORABLE LUL
[4:47:33] <SilverSnowFFXIV> Thinking that's far. He doesn't know.
[4:47:33] <%Jekado> so you can have everything CLEAN
[4:47:39] <+JobbedBone> yeah but you never have to go back right?
[4:47:41] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> You can put the constructors next to the mine.
[4:47:44] <NitronStreams> gonna need a lot of cable and iron plates
[4:47:48] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> So you only ship concrete.
[4:47:56] <Megalofyte> it's not far off you can see the destination
[4:48:04] <%TheWinged7> psaGoblin
[4:48:09] <Veluren> Yes
[4:48:10] <Zaphire_Saucypants> yes
[4:48:11] <s1rcuit> yes
[4:48:11] <xbb1024> yep
[4:48:12] <%DiscoMatador> Yep
[4:48:13] <%depressed_skeleton> Tons.
[4:48:13] <+queaks> Lots
[4:48:13] <celysus> yeah
[4:48:13] <NitronStreams> yes
[4:48:13] <CappuccinoGuil> There's a point where I always keep a full stack of each basic material to build stuff
[4:48:14] <%SwdVengeance> Yeah, and they can be automated
[4:48:14] <%Jekado> yes
[4:48:14] <CappuccinoGuil> Yes
[4:48:15] <Veluren> ATV and you can set up trams
[4:48:16] <CrematedCube> yes, all kinds
[4:48:16] <Megalofyte> this map is stupid huge
[4:48:16] <BwdYeti> Several
[4:48:16] <$Trenr> yes, it later tiers
[4:48:17] <penitentpendant> Gettin' that Cardio in
[4:48:19] <+Brightstreak> yep multiple vehicles
[4:48:19] <%Jekado> ALOT infact
[4:48:20] <%TheWinged7> seems pats getting past the endorphin rush and into the psaGoblin  territory
[4:48:25] <$HyperionXV> There's even a jetpack
[4:48:26] <+BusterRepukken> automated vehicles too
[4:48:32] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> And other movement options.
[4:48:34] <xbb1024> There's even a joke one
[4:48:36] <%DiscoMatador> Also jumpo pads
[4:48:38] <+PersonifiedTFT> Hella vehicles
[4:48:40] <%Monkeyweed21> The goal is to eventually cover the whole planet with GLORIOUS PRODUCTION
[4:48:49] <Veluren> This map is unbelievably tremendous, so there's a lot of ways to get around including trains you can build tracks for
[4:48:57] <CappuccinoGuil> ?????????
[4:48:59] <DrkJP520> Can you ride the shoopuf?
[4:49:06] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Wires are the easiest thing to delete all and start over better.
[4:49:16] <+queaks> Now you know what those big metal things by powerstations are IRL
[4:49:27] <akitanito> too long
[4:49:30] <+Brightstreak> wire too long
[4:49:32] <NitronStreams> too long
[4:49:40] <Veluren> Gotta set up poles along the way
[4:49:41] <+TheMorilo> blind m\n
[4:49:46] <%Jekado> its not gonna go that long pat
[4:49:48] <gryffinp> no, no it's WAY too llong
[4:49:49] <CappuccinoGuil> still long
[4:49:51] <SilverSnowFFXIV> Prompts.  How do i read.
[4:49:52] <akitanito> No, you were getting the message halfway
[4:49:54] <TundraOW> Oh God it's Death Stranding
[4:49:58] <TundraOW> This is a Strand Game
[4:50:01] <%DorianCreed> Walk it back, nerd
[4:50:07] <dinnydanny777> Why can't they just make a big wire
[4:50:10] <penitentpendant> Wire Stranding
[4:50:12] <%Jekado> its only like i think 20 meters i think?
[4:50:19] <%Taisuru> Is pat satisfied yet?
[4:50:20] <NitronStreams> There you go!
[4:50:22] <+queaks> now time for BELT
[4:50:25] <%Fooguwu> a wire is just a strand
[4:50:39] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Double the ore means double the constructors
[4:50:40] <NitronStreams> ALL THE PLATES!
[4:50:45] <+BusterRepukken> it might be time to relocate
[4:50:48] <gryffinp> I think maybe you should have left that nearby limestone miner intact
[4:50:48] <%Fooguwu> several twisted strands
[4:50:49] <+queaks> @PatStaresAt You might as well turn it to concrete before belting it back
[4:50:52] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> heck yeah
[4:50:53] <%notsoy> gonna need 300 plates for that lmao
[4:50:55] <%shruke> time for spaghetti conveyors
[4:50:55] <%Monkeyweed21> You need more concrete too @PatStaresAt
[4:50:58] <T_Sasquatch> Im still mad about how game journos made death stranding sound liike an alien
[4:51:03] <CappuccinoGuil> I cannot wait for Pat to explain this game to Woolie
[4:51:04] <+MisterAvry> if this is anything like factorio you're always gonna need more plates
[4:51:05] <%Broand> Eventually you'll be making a dedicated storage for all of these materials so you can yank them as needed
[4:51:11] <Zaphire_Saucypants> is there a stage of development where you can get rid of wires and go full wireless?
[4:51:11] <%yves_is_online> yves_is_online subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 14 months! 
[4:51:18] <DrkJP520> get them plates and mantles
[4:51:22] <%Broand> no
[4:51:28] <CappuccinoGuil> @Zaphire_Saucypants no
[4:51:32] <%Fooguwu> wish someone would yank me as needed @Broand
[4:51:34] <+queaks> Plate heaven
[4:51:40] <+ReallyBigRocks> oh no he left the conveyor pole
[4:51:50] <CappuccinoGuil> @Zaphire_Saucypants how are you going to transfer power wirelessly? That's not E F F I C I E N T
[4:52:06] <CappuccinoGuil> @ReallyBigRocks he'll learn LUL
[4:52:10] <%Pecorah> Pecorah subscribed with Prime. 
[4:52:15] <%Monkeyweed21> If you get conveyor mergers then you can dump it all into 1 container @PatStaresAt
[4:52:18] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt Can you kill that backend of an elephant?
[4:52:33] <%Jekado> @CappuccinoGuil future update might be powered floor plates
[4:52:36] <xbb1024> you can just put the constructor next to the miner
[4:52:39] <%Monkeyweed21> put a foundation down first
[4:52:53] <+ReallyBigRocks> @CappuccinoGuil will he, cuz he keeps looking right past it lol
[4:53:45] <CappuccinoGuil> Remember an hour or so ago when he had a brain wave with the constructor? Look at him go now
[4:54:02] <xbb1024> do the pole on the cliff first and drag down
[4:54:04] <%Hiro01231> Hiro01231 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 20 months! 
[4:54:23] <+queaks> Click first then look up
[4:54:24] <zazzera01> click and aim
[4:54:27] <Veluren> Click once to set position, then it lifts
[4:54:28] <gryffinp> click it once and then yank up
[4:54:30] <BwdYeti> Place, then adjust
[4:54:32] <CappuccinoGuil> Click once, move mouse
[4:54:33] <%depressed_skeleton> Place it then scroll up
[4:54:35] <Griffin1171> just do a short one, then finish it
[4:54:53] <NitronStreams> 👏👏👏👏
[4:55:06] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt And thus the planet's transformation into a forgeworld began
[4:55:07] <DrkJP520> Now this is podracing!
[4:55:14] <+ReallyBigRocks> Pat, slide then jump you go much faster
[4:55:16] <SixthShinx> Pay your bills, Pat
[4:55:22] <+queaks> At least now you can run up belt to get back up
[4:55:27] <dinnydanny777> don't fuck the concrete
[4:55:30] <%QueequegTheater> Warframe movement
[4:55:34] <penitentpendant> Biofuel for the Biofuel Gods!
[4:55:35] <gryffinp> It is unless you're going uphill
[4:55:36] <%notsoy> don't you have biomass you can turn into more solid biomass?
[4:55:37] <SixthShinx> Sliding or rolling is always faster
[4:55:43] <gryffinp> can't slide uphill so you just crash your momentum
[4:55:48] <+D00msDayDan> automate the shit out of concrete and encase the whole planet in foundation
[4:56:02] <akitanito> I miss zoren copters
[4:56:17] <+ReallyBigRocks> You can get some good launches if you do it right
[4:56:21] <+queaks> Hows Elmo holding up Pat?
[4:56:22] <Veluren> Making floating cities in this game is also easier than it should be and very neat
[4:56:23] <%QueequegTheater> Pat, if you make enough concrete you can make the entire planet clean
[4:56:55] <+queaks> My new kitty cat Miso popped the yoga ball I was sitting on cause I wouldnt let her eat my lunch
[4:57:07] <NitronStreams> honestly if anything I'd say make a constructor for just biofuel since it takes so much crafting time
[4:57:24] <%QueequegTheater> YEYEYEYE
[4:57:28] <Griffin1171> double speed\
[4:57:28] <%SomersaultJustice> andy bogard
[4:57:33] <BwdYeti> rocks to the end, baby
[4:57:34] <%MidnightBurst12> IT'S ALIVE
[4:57:34] <PrishKitla> ROCKS!!!
[4:57:36] <%Wurmspawn> Cue the black out.
[4:57:36] <@commanderclaw> Is this what it feels like to be an industrialist?
[4:57:43] <penitentpendant> To veterans, is he far enough away from the next fuel level that he should work towards automating biofuel? (Even though insertion step will be manual)
[4:57:45] <akitanito> 2x!
[4:57:47] <%notsoy> this is way more production than the old node jesus christ
[4:57:47] <+queaks> Constructor can only do 45...
[4:57:48] <Griffin1171> saturated belts
[4:57:49] <%GalacticaPhanto> Rock and Roll baby
[4:57:52] <iosephe> stonks
[4:57:56] <%Broand> Consumes 45 per minute
[4:57:58] <xbb1024> It takes 45, outputs 15
[4:58:00] <Psyramics> oof, that's a weird ratio
[4:58:04] <%QueequegTheater> Yes
[4:58:05] <%DianaTheAscian> prob
[4:58:06] <Veluren> It might get jammed, but this early jamming is fine
[4:58:07] <zazzera01> takes 45
[4:58:07] <%QueequegTheater> No
[4:58:08] <gryffinp> yep
[4:58:08] <+Shackle_Rustyford> uh oh
[4:58:08] <+ReallyBigRocks> yup
[4:58:09] <+TheBobulus> I think your belts only go 30?
[4:58:09] <%QueequegTheater> Maybe
[4:58:10] <+Shackle_Rustyford> now he knows
[4:58:11] <%BakiinPlaysStuff> Does he have the splitter yet?
[4:58:12] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt You'll need a conveyor splitter to actual use your new miner  to its full potential
[4:58:16] <%blastyoboots> storage container
[4:58:18] <%blastyoboots> on belt
[4:58:19] <CappuccinoGuil> @Psyramics there's a reason why it's weird Kappa
[4:58:19] <NitronStreams> might need a storage crate s a buffer
[4:58:22] <+queaks> You can get a splitter and build a second constructor next to it
[4:58:29] <xbb1024> You don't have splitters yet, nothing you can do about it now
[4:58:35] <CappuccinoGuil> LOGISTICS TIME, BABY
[4:58:41] <Zaphire_Saucypants> iiiinteresting
[4:58:43] <+BusterRepukken> Andy Bogard KOF XV trailer out.
[4:58:45] <%ZeOrbling> you can use a storage as a buffer
[4:58:52] <+queaks> @PatStaresAt Theres a website dedicated to making optimal factories
[4:58:52] <+BusterRepukken> Fatal Fury team?
[4:59:07] <%blastyoboots> put a storage crate as a buffer on the belt in and out so you still mine at full speed
[4:59:15] <%notsoy> go check your storage crates
[4:59:17] <%Dingalow> Dingalow subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months, currently on a 2 month streak! Hello, Pratick
[4:59:21] <SixthShinx> Fuckin' rods Kreygasm
[4:59:25] <Manwad> The factory must grow to accommodate the needs of the factory.
[4:59:30] <Jathspuh> Is this a mind goblins game?
[4:59:44] <penitentpendant> @Jathspuh Yup
[4:59:45] <%Dingalow> Is this mineycrafta?
[4:59:50] <+queaks> @PatStaresAt Maybe worth making a second iron miner for Rods and set the first one to plates
[4:59:53] <%QueequegTheater> Infinite wire works
[4:59:59] <xbb1024> redirect the conveyor
[5:00:05] <+ReallyBigRocks> @Jathspuh It gives the goblins the good chemicals they crave
[5:00:08] <+Javaa01> @Dingalow Yes, it's just the Technic Pack
[5:00:10] <Griffin1171> the wire constructor will fill up automatically
[5:00:12] <$HyperionXV> Maybe a buffer storage crate between the constructors
[5:00:39] <%notsoy> conveyer splitter is one of the new things you can get
[5:00:44] <%Dingalow> @Dingalow :o
[5:00:46] <Psyramics> you got two iron deposits, you can make two production lines off of it
[5:00:50] <%Broand> Space elevator
[5:00:56] <%shry7> !uptime
[5:00:56] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 5h 1m.
[5:00:58] <+queaks> So splitters?
[5:01:02] <%QueequegTheater> It needs to be infinite
[5:01:03] <%Jekado> where it needs to be?
[5:01:04] <%BakiinPlaysStuff> This game gives you a lot of clear goals while you build up your factory and I think that's a big incentive for people who aren't too into just "make big factory"
[5:01:04] <iosephe> spess elevator
[5:01:07] <penitentpendant> Plus or Minus Biofuel Limitations
[5:01:09] <%Jekado> where does it need to be tho pat?
[5:01:09] <%SilvaChariot0133> Where does it need to be?
[5:01:10] <+EmotionalFatGuy> dont make it where it needs to be.  make it where it will need to be
[5:01:12] <+TheBobulus> ...and then tear down everything and rebuild it on concrete
[5:01:14] <CappuccinoGuil> And where does it need to be?
[5:01:15] <%SilvaChariot0133> 🤔
[5:01:17] <Tuna_Can_0> atpCap I'm sure you'll stop there
[5:01:24] <%SilvaChariot0133> LUL
[5:01:24] <%Broand> Space elevator is the hypest moment of  earlygame
[5:01:25] <+TheBobulus> lol, same
[5:01:29] <+ReallyBigRocks> Do Mk1 conveyors do 30 or 60 resources per minute?
[5:01:31] <Visorak6> PAVE THE PLANET
[5:01:32] <+vaderxyz1970> make it CLEAN
[5:01:34] <EvanDude47> @PatStaresAt When you have conveyor splitter and combiner, direct it so half the wire splits off and combines with the end of the cable conveyor into the crate to make half and half
[5:01:39] <%Arancet> you gonna continue this? (on or off stream?)
[5:01:42] <+red_cuppa> do we have a verdict on if we like this game i just made it back
[5:01:43] <NitronStreams> welcome to Pat's Concrete Supplier
[5:01:46] <+queaks> The space elevator is so incredible, please build it on stream
[5:01:47] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt Why not keep this as Site A and make a Site B with the new stuff?
[5:01:48] <@SoFarFetched> IT ELMO
[5:01:49] <+BusterRepukken> Andy Bogard means Terry next week right since they already showed Joe
[5:01:50] <xbb1024> You don't need to tear it down, just let it keep producing while you move elsewhere
[5:01:51] <+SocialMisfitGamer> ELMOOOOOO

[5:02:03] <MidnightDeacon> oh god, Satispatory
[5:02:05] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt So all it took to get you to enjoy creativity games is extreme stratification and compartmentalizing of every process

[5:02:20] <%notsoy> if you disassemble the hub, does that disassemble everything?
[5:02:21] <CappuccinoGuil> You should SUPER get Field Research next
[5:02:25] <+queaks> It shows each building efficiency
[5:02:26] <+vaderxyz1970> Garden of Eden I sleep, Parking lot REAL SHIT
[5:02:27] <%Jekado> Scaling
[5:02:31] <%Broand> It'll show you how efficient your shit is when you look at a machine
[5:02:33] <%Jekado> you can limit production speeds
[5:02:36] <+queaks> Look at the building
[5:02:36] <%Jekado> its a slider
[5:02:38] <+TheBobulus> @patstaresat Look at a constructor, there should be a new panel at the bottom
[5:02:44] <CappuccinoGuil> @notsoy no, it's a separate structure from everything
[5:02:44] <+ReallyBigRocks> it shows a little percentage in all the machines
[5:02:44] <%Jekado> its a slider on all the machines
[5:02:49] <zazzera01> its a percentage on the production building
[5:02:50] <%Broand> Scaling is power worms
[5:02:51] <gryffinp> @Jekado different feature
[5:02:56] <%StewTheGreat> you have to research overclocking first
[5:02:59] <Coystick> Pave paradise you coward
[5:03:04] <%StewTheGreat> he doesn't have it yet
[5:03:06] <%Jekado> oh not slugs right
[5:03:16] <%QueequegTheater> You can limit efficiency to prevent the belt getting backed up
[5:03:17] <CappuccinoGuil> Field Research now, BABY!
[5:03:28] <+Javaa01> Time to O p t i m i z e
[5:03:41] <+queaks> You can build splitters on existing belts
[5:03:50] <%Broand> You only need one splitter for concrete
[5:03:51] <%Rumbutt> Rumbutt subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 20 months! CONCRETE CONCRETE CONCRETE
[5:03:54] <%QueequegTheater> You should really make one building for each material
[5:04:01] <%Monkeyweed21> Split then merge after constructors @PatStaresAt
[5:04:02] <xbb1024> so you merge all you inputs, then use splitters before each constructor
[5:04:04] <+ReallyBigRocks> Build another production line for plates, you have two iron nodes
[5:04:11] <%notsoy> yeah split the limestone belt and get more constructors
[5:04:12] <NitronStreams> need to set up that second iron mine soon
[5:04:16] <CappuccinoGuil> @queaks buhexcuse me???
[5:04:44] <+Shackle_Rustyford> im getting death stranding vibes
[5:04:48] <%XzileGaming> this is as close as Pat will ever get to playing minecraft type games
[5:04:49] <Jakerham_Lincoln> K I left for like 2 hours holy fuck Pats in there now
[5:04:50] <%Broand> Oh you'll need a merger too
[5:04:59] <%I_chose_Rapture> I_chose_Rapture subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 27 months! 
[5:05:07] <%QueequegTheater> Pat Stares At Becoming A Manufacturing Tycoon
[5:05:13] <+queaks> You can build splitters on existing belts pat
[5:05:17] <%CommanderSqueaks> Is Pat now having full blown conversations with his industrial equipment?
[5:05:23] <%Broand> You can build a splitter onto a constructed belt if its straight
[5:05:30] <+Shackle_Rustyford> why wont kojimbo just make an industrial simulator
[5:05:37] <+ReallyBigRocks> Pat saying "I know" like the machine is gonna be upset with him that he turned it off lmao
[5:05:56] <+HitchhikingThrough> i'M BACK
[5:05:59] <+HitchhikingThrough> wor
[5:06:00] <+queaks> Building them far apart is a waste of belts
[5:06:01] <%QueequegTheater> @CommanderSqueaks Have you never fixed a lawn mower? This is just what you do
[5:06:04] <+HitchhikingThrough> *wow thanks capslock
[5:06:08] <%sumrand0> wot
[5:06:18] <xbb1024> mind goblins
[5:06:25] <%valriot> I realised this is basically why Death Stranding worked
[5:06:28] <%Broand> Pick up the pylon that was placed
[5:06:32] <%Broand> there
[5:06:39] <+queaks> You can build mergers on existing belts
[5:06:41] <+Xooler67> wtf is this game?
[5:06:46] <+ReallyBigRocks> just leaving conveyor poles all over the place like a maniac
[5:06:51] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt you can put splitters and mergers on existing belts
[5:06:52] <%KeiganOfAstora> Just checking in. How are thing?
[5:06:52] <%rumtumtugnutz> capslock is an anagram of cockslap
[5:07:08] <%BakiinPlaysStuff> Yeyeyeye minimize space
[5:07:16] <Visorak6> Are we gonna see more of this or is this just a one off toe dip?
[5:07:16] <+queaks> @PatStaresAt You can build merges and splitters on existing belts
[5:07:17] <%KeiganOfAstora> @rumtumtugnutz LUL
[5:07:27] <NitronStreams> 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
[5:07:31] <%sumrand0> What a shame that all this nature obscures my view of all the beautiful INDUSTRY
[5:07:32] <%Monkeyweed21> dont forget the power @PatStaresAt
[5:07:37] <+BusterRepukken> owned
[5:07:37] <%notsoy> HOOK IT UP
[5:07:48] <akitanito> destroy it all!
[5:07:49] <%KeiganOfAstora> Make it look pretty
[5:07:49] <zazzera01> he's expressing his CREATIVITY chat
[5:07:53] <KShirahama> power and recepie
[5:07:58] <%Jekado> @queaks its a bit fincky i've had it not connect properly
[5:08:06] <+HitchhikingThrough> and Pat's also hooked
[5:08:06] <%Broand> You can check your power grid by looking at power poles
[5:08:25] <%KeiganOfAstora> @PatStaresAt So what's the end goal here? What are you building?
[5:08:29] <+queaks> @Jekado Depends if you want it on grid or not
[5:08:33] <+Shackle_Rustyford> he still hasnt discovered the true power of storage units
[5:08:45] <+Shackle_Rustyford> excited for that brain blast
[5:08:49] <%KeiganOfAstora> ten ten?
[5:08:58] <ammobasket> You should work de-energized anyway. For Safety.
[5:08:59] <+Shackle_Rustyford> what if theoretically
[5:09:06] <CappuccinoGuil> DON'T ANSWER
[5:09:07] <%rumtumtugnutz> 1.5 per minute
[5:09:07] <%Nekros4442> Pat....The wait for STrive just got longer...What do
[5:09:07] <+Shackle_Rustyford> you could use storage units to store things
[5:09:08] <+D00msDayDan> honmono chikara wo misete ageyo
[5:09:09] <T_Sasquatch> i get the fun of this game but i feel like i wouldve burned out by noe
[5:09:14] <%Jekado> @queaks no like i think its a weird glitch where it doesn't connect even on non grid.
[5:09:19] <+Shackle_Rustyford> then send them elsewhere
[5:09:22] <Coystick> Crate dynamics
[5:09:24] <%TheWinged7> you can use a storage unit to dump resources into then have conveyors pull things out of it to your factories
[5:09:27] <%Jjrossman> the hypest gameplay on twitch
[5:09:33] <%Jjrossman> CONSTRUCTION
[5:09:38] <+queaks> @Jekado Thats odd, ive never had that heppen
[5:09:55] <%BakiinPlaysStuff> Cant wait for the further away resources
[5:10:03] <%shruke> it's alive!
[5:10:09] <+ReallyBigRocks> YEAH DO IT
[5:10:11] <%QueequegTheater> YEYEYEYE LET'S GOOOO
[5:10:16] <+BusterRepukken> this game is virtual crack
[5:10:17] <+Walopoh> look at that
[5:10:19] <xbb1024> yeah, these are level 1 belts
[5:10:25] <+queaks> So 30 each way
[5:10:25] <+PersonifiedTFT> I've been excited for GG strive for multiple years now and encouraging my friends to look into it so its gonna be incredibly sad to watch that game completely crash and burn because of the week they delayed it to
[5:10:26] <tanklets> Shame about this start is that the later stuff is so fuckin far away
[5:10:30] <%shruke> Did you know you can measure power and reset the grid from any pole?
[5:10:36] <tanklets> Get ready to drive for 5 minutes for coal
[5:10:42] <%Broand> but each device eats 45 each
[5:10:42] <%notsoy> why is one of those lights yellow?
[5:10:45] <%TheBensonator_> PatStaresAt The Means Of Production
[5:11:09] <BwdYeti> 10 each, because they're getting 30/45 per minute
[5:11:10] <%Jekado> yeah the conversion isn't not 1/2
[5:11:10] <Psyramics> its not 15 each, its 10 each
[5:11:12] <cherrycottontail> @notsoy factory is idle
[5:11:17] <CappuccinoGuil> @tank7013 in this area, there's a coal source not too far. The problem is water. Nearest lake is much further away
[5:11:20] <+ReallyBigRocks> They aren't going to be at 100% tho
[5:11:20] <Coystick> Pat that's too much cement
[5:11:26] <+queaks> 20 per minute
[5:11:30] <zazzera01> a pure node would split the limestone evenly 45-45
[5:11:36] <+queaks> The first one had a backlog
[5:11:37] <zedravan> @notsoy did not have the resources to work yet
[5:11:41] <Veluren> The distance of travel, it's reaching it later
[5:11:42] <+ReallyBigRocks> The first one had a backlog of concrete
[5:11:45] <CappuccinoGuil> @notsoy it's on standby for some reason. Power or resources needed.
[5:11:46] <Veluren> And backlog
[5:11:47] <%DorianCreed> Banked limestone
[5:11:48] <xbb1024> It had stuff in the input from before
[5:11:50] <%Broand> look at the input per minute on the constructors
[5:11:50] <$Trenr> they need 45 a minute to produce at 100%
[5:11:55] <zedravan> the other one had a buffer
[5:11:56] <+TipsyND> It's using 45/m
[5:11:57] <%DianaTheAscian> distance?
[5:11:58] <CappuccinoGuil> The first one had accumulated limestone
[5:12:00] <%Jekado> because your only getting 60 in
[5:12:00] <%Broand> and cry
[5:12:02] <+queaks> The first one had a build up of limestone its workihg through
[5:12:02] <KShirahama> buffer in other one before power went down
[5:12:03] <%Jekado> you need 90 in
[5:12:03] <CrematedCube> It has some backlog from before rerouting
[5:12:16] <ammobasket> Internal buffer on first one
[5:12:17] <+TheBobulus> Pat, I believe your belts only go 30/minute until you upgrade them?
[5:12:21] <gryffinp> well don't take it OUT
[5:12:26] <+TheBobulus> no, it's 60, I'm wrong
[5:12:33] <%tank7013> @CappuccinoGuil Think you replied to the wrong guy
[5:12:34] <+queaks> It takes a second to figure out efficiency FYI
[5:12:34] <%Broken_Sonex> All you need now is a top hat and a monocle while saying "Mmm, yes industry, yes." @PatStaresAt
[5:12:35] <%Jekado> 60 for tier one
[5:12:35] <Dommykins> It takes like a full minute for the percentages to equal out
[5:12:35] <xbb1024> average over time
[5:12:39] <%Bluwizard21> Travel time?
[5:12:39] <%TheWinged7> still better than 1 at 100
[5:12:40] <+ReallyBigRocks> The efficiency is an average so itll go down over time
[5:12:41] <%DorianCreed> It's an over-time aggregate and it's falling
[5:12:44] <%shruke> it averages I think
[5:12:44] <Dommykins> It reads out efficiency per minute.
[5:12:49] <%notsoy> put some extra limestone in there lmao
[5:12:50] <Veluren> The belt is making it take some time to get there since it's farther away
[5:12:50] <CappuccinoGuil> Longer belt, longer trip, less efficient
[5:12:51] <%Jekado> 120 for 2, 270 for tier 3 for... some reason...
[5:12:52] <zedravan> it is slowly accumulating extra limestone
[5:12:57] <CappuccinoGuil> @tank7013 oh oops, sorry
[5:12:59] <$Trenr> should both be around 66% efficiency anyway
[5:13:07] <%QueequegTheater> The two will settle eventually
[5:13:12] <+queaks> Thats more concrete than before for sure
[5:13:12] <EvanDude47> the two 67% are more than the 100% of the single constructor though
[5:13:14] <%Broand> look at the input per minute, it's not totally efficient, but it'll do
[5:13:19] <@commanderclaw> Finally Pat will realize his dream to pave the wold in cubes
[5:13:20] <gryffinp> Rather than fuss about maximum efficiency per building, what really matters is efficiency per resource node.
[5:13:29] <+queaks> Hell yeah
[5:13:32] <akitanito> Cover the planet in gray!
[5:13:38] <Veluren> So Pat, do we take this as -concrete- evidence you like this game?
[5:13:42] <%tank7013> @CappuccinoGuil No worries
[5:13:46] <EuropanLamprey> Now Pat can build the mega Cube
[5:13:50] <%Monkeyweed21> PAVE OVER THE NAA'VI
[5:13:57] <NitronStreams> Now THAT! is satisfactory
[5:13:59] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Turn this pile of filthy nature into a FORGEWORLD
[5:14:03] <xbb1024> When you occupy yourself with doing something else, it's actually quite fast to fill up
[5:14:10] <%Jjrossman> Pats heavy breathing is making my wife double take, thinking its me
[5:14:17] <%DakotaMacDoodle> This is how Pat becomes Andrew Ryan
[5:14:20] <$QueequegTheater> IT BEGINS
[5:14:22] <%walternatorz> I'm worried.
[5:14:23] <+HitchhikingThrough> F L A T
[5:14:24] <+Shackle_Rustyford> goblins begin
[5:14:24] <Veluren> And it begins
[5:14:24] <%notsoy> conveyer lift?!?!
[5:14:30] <+D00msDayDan> g r i d
[5:14:31] <+ReallyBigRocks> Parking lot time
[5:14:32] <tanklets> Grid time
[5:14:32] <+Pixel_Matt> monkaS
[5:14:34] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Try the thicc plates, pat
[5:14:35] <gryffinp> literal and figurative foundation of a truly powerful factory
[5:14:36] <Griffin1171> FLOOR
[5:14:36] <NitronStreams> ALL MUST BE SMOOTH
[5:14:40] <%medjoe> Time to build the Olympic Stadium
[5:14:46] <tanklets> Build taller
[5:14:49] <%Broand> yyyyyep
[5:14:50] <+Shackle_Rustyford> not enough f o u n d a t i o n
[5:14:51] <+TipsyND> Too low!
[5:14:51] <s1rcuit> too short
[5:14:51] <$Trenr> well, make it taller then
[5:14:52] <celysus> use taller ones
[5:14:52] <akitanito> lame foundations
[5:14:53] <+ReallyBigRocks> Use the taller foundations
[5:14:53] <%Broken_Sonex> MMMMM YESSS, INDUSTRY, YESSSS
[5:14:53] <NitronStreams> because videogames
[5:14:54] <%TheWinged7> its a feature (tm)
[5:14:54] <BwdYeti> Use taller ones or raise them up
[5:14:55] <Veluren> It could be a layer up, it's kinda in the ground
[5:14:56] <xbb1024> Make sure it's high enough so you don't get terrain issues
[5:14:56] <$QueequegTheater> Build higher up
[5:14:57] <Mr_Rakjo> Taller
[5:14:57] <+BusterRepukken> build the thicker foundation
[5:14:58] <tanklets> The higer foundations cost the same
[5:14:58] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Use a thicker foundation
[5:14:58] <%depressed_skeleton> That was my mind goblin too
[5:14:58] <EuropanLamprey> Cover the whole planet in a slab of concrete, just to show it whose boss
[5:14:59] <+Walopoh> Build taller
[5:15:00] <$Trenr> use the bigger ones
[5:15:00] <$SGrim> Must build taller
[5:15:00] <%Jekado> build the taller one...
[5:15:01] <%Monkeyweed21> use the thicc plates
[5:15:01] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> thiccer*
[5:15:02] <%ZeOrbling> the taller platform is the same price
[5:15:02] <%tank7013> Because literally everything in this game can clip it seems
[5:15:03] <Griffin1171> use thicker foundations
[5:15:04] <%TheWinged7> congrats pat, youll now have a grid to snap to
[5:15:04] <CrematedCube> This is why the thicker plates are better for ground level
[5:15:05] <+Shackle_Rustyford> make a taller parking lot
[5:15:09] <%Wurmspawn> Now, remove the surface from being a factor and build an antigravity factory in the sky.
[5:15:10] <CappuccinoGuil> @notsoy let's you move objects in a quicker vertical angle. Good for bringing stuff up/down a cliff
[5:15:12] <+Walopoh> You built into the ground a bit @PatStaresAt
[5:15:12] <Megalofyte> TRAILER
[5:15:12] <gryffinp> well you asked before why anyone would use 8x8x2 foundation... now you know
[5:15:14] <Tytangamer> Foundation plates stack.
[5:15:15] <%Jekado> plants go through unfortunately... even grow BACK THROUGH
[5:15:15] <tanklets> Dont forget the hotbar too. Makes foundation building way easier
[5:15:20] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Foundations are a good time to set build shortcuts
[5:15:21] <Megalofyte> TALLER
[5:15:26] <$Trenr> yes
[5:15:26] <$QueequegTheater> yes
[5:15:28] <zazzera01> yessir
[5:15:28] <gryffinp> yep
[5:15:30] <%Jekado> yeah
[5:15:32] <%BakiinPlaysStuff> You can build two on top of each other and delete the bottom one right?
[5:15:34] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> yes
[5:15:35] <gryffinp> although personally I never bother
[5:15:39] <+ReallyBigRocks> Just stand on top of your crate tower @PatStaresAt
[5:15:44] <s1rcuit> intuitive
[5:15:53] <%Jekado> there is a mod that lets you mass build with the scroll wheel its super helpful
[5:15:56] <xbb1024> I also like building my first floor high enough so you can crouch under
[5:15:58] <gryffinp> power poles I think but the defaults are trash
[5:16:05] <zazzera01> power pole. its fine you only need cable for the most part
[5:16:07] <%DorianCreed> 1 was Power Poles
[5:16:15] <%shruke> I usually just build the tall ones
[5:16:15] <tanklets> Alt+scroll to use the other hotbars
[5:16:17] <%Broand> You can have more than one bar though
[5:16:18] <$QueequegTheater> FIX YOUR HOTBARS THO
[5:16:19] <tanklets> You get 10 I think
[5:16:21] <gryffinp> @PatStaresAt hey you know what's dope, hold alt and scroll the scroll wheel
[5:16:23] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> alt+mousewheel to scroll hotbars
[5:16:24] <+ReallyBigRocks> Also you have 10 different hotbars
[5:16:33] <Sain_127> paaaaat
[5:16:37] <NitronStreams> oh man your copper line is backed up
[5:16:39] <%Broand> I usually have hotbar 2 as my foundations one
[5:16:39] <%notsoy> neat, make your new factory next to the paleberry plant
[5:16:43] <CappuccinoGuil> oh my god, there are NINE hotbars now?
[5:16:48] <ChungusQuest> why is your character silhouette on the inventory screen so dummy thicc?
[5:16:51] <blink289> Hey pat you can craft a cyber truck later on
[5:16:52] <%notsoy> oh yeah you have a pure copper node, right?
[5:16:58] <SilverFaustX> new switch is coming this xmas, had 4k support and a oled screen
[5:16:59] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt you can optimize your copper production
[5:17:04] <s1rcuit> @Spudnacious_Dynasty I didn't know about that, thanks!
[5:17:06] <+ReallyBigRocks> @CappuccinoGuil 10 but yeah
[5:17:07] <SilverFaustX> has*
[5:17:07] <%notsoy> you could probably create another split with two productors
[5:17:08] <%Broand> Normal copper
[5:17:24] <%Broand> He can optimize a lot of things let him slap down a foundation first
[5:17:32] <%FacetiousAF> @vintagespiffy get the fuck back here SwiftRage
[5:18:04] <+ReallyBigRocks> YEAH DOIN IT
[5:18:09] <zazzera01> aww yeah
[5:18:13] <gryffinp> obviously building out the foundation into a big rectangle takes a lot of concrete, what with how geometry works
[5:18:18] <zazzera01> its happenin y'all
[5:18:20] <$QueequegTheater> He won't have enough
[5:18:23] <%DiscoMatador> PAVE THE EARTH CLEAN
[5:18:32] <EuropanLamprey> Now we actually just Minecraft
[5:18:34] <+HitchhikingThrough> LUL
[5:18:45] <+MisterAvry> friendship ENDED with Valheim
[5:18:45] <xbb1024> you can use the thinner ones for the middle
[5:18:46] <SixthShinx> Friendship ended with Valheim
[5:18:49] <T_Sasquatch> wipe out the grass. make a true concrete jungle
[5:18:49] <LVL1_Scumbag> Valheim doesn't have production chains
[5:18:50] <+HitchhikingThrough> Modded minecraft hours
[5:18:50] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt look at the far end and do it
[5:18:52] <$Afterman_> pat has ascended
[5:18:53] <gryffinp> I started playing valheim recently and honestly, I like it, but there are a lot of times playing it that I go "I wish this were as good as it is in satisfactory"
[5:18:58] <%CommanderSqueaks> @EuropanLamprey A much prettier, more intuitive Minecraft.
[5:18:58] <+ReallyBigRocks> Does Valheim have giant concrete grids? Didn't think so
[5:19:00] <$QueequegTheater> Yes it will
[5:19:00] <tanklets> It will
[5:19:02] <Griffin1171> just run on your existing foundation while building the next layer
[5:19:03] <zazzera01> remember if you think you have enough space, you don't
[5:19:04] <xbb1024> it will be flat with the top
[5:19:05] <EvanDude47> it will snap upward
[5:19:05] <SilverSnowFFXIV> Wat.
[5:19:06] <tanklets> it snaps to the higest
[5:19:06] <+HitchhikingThrough> I think it will snap flush?
[5:19:08] <%DakotaMacDoodle> The world shall be a cube
[5:19:10] <BwdYeti> The top surface will be flat
[5:19:10] <moosemonkey397> it will snap to be flat
[5:19:12] <zedravan> they align
[5:19:14] <$QueequegTheater> It attaches at the top
[5:19:14] <%Monkeyweed21> it doesnt matter
[5:19:15] <T_Sasquatch> now all we have to do is wait for pat to get insecure once he sees someone elses factory Kappa
[5:19:15] <Karebuncle> They snap to the same level
[5:19:16] <%DiscoMatador> It snaps upward
[5:19:19] <blink289> it does snap
[5:19:19] <mae_bun> It snaps to the other foundation height
[5:19:20] <tanklets> It will always be level
[5:19:22] <%Broand> Why use thinner ones? They're not cheaper
[5:19:23] <+Walopoh> Pat's desire for a pure, perfect world are gradually become real
[5:19:24] <+MisterAvry> it's not that kind of game, but I'd like valheim more if it had automation
[5:19:25] <+ReallyBigRocks> It also doesn't matter because they all cost the same
[5:19:28] <zazzera01> they all cost the same anyway
[5:19:28] <gryffinp> Not like it matters if he uses thinner ones, since they cost the same
[5:19:30] <+HitchhikingThrough> for the edges
[5:19:30] <Psyramics> try it and see what happens
[5:19:30] <+MrJackett> Doesn't matter anyway...all cost the same
[5:19:33] <$QueequegTheater> Less materials
[5:19:36] <tanklets> Really isnt one
[5:19:37] <CrematedCube> It's aesthetic goblins
[5:19:38] <Karebuncle> the small one costs less
[5:19:40] <mae_bun> The small one gives you more room
[5:19:43] <EvanDude47> no its the same
[5:19:44] <$Trenr> aesthetics
[5:19:45] <Visorak6> no it isnt less
[5:19:48] <Karebuncle> Then who cares lol
[5:19:50] <$QueequegTheater> wait what
[5:19:51] <+HitchhikingThrough> huh interesting
[5:19:52] <$QueequegTheater> that's dumb
[5:19:55] <+D00msDayDan> all 3 cost 6
[5:19:56] <xbb1024> For 2nd floor
[5:19:57] <%Wurmspawn> Lots of oneguys....
[5:19:58] <%medjoe> Borg cube time
[5:19:58] <gryffinp> don't lie to pad queequeg
[5:20:00] <%ZeOrbling> for thinner cielings/floors
[5:20:00] <SixthShinx> Chat's goblins are stronger than Pat's
[5:20:00] <blink289> more space to build
[5:20:01] <+BusterRepukken> chat doesnt even know lmao
[5:20:01] <+TheBobulus> Visual beauty. Make different levels and stuff
[5:20:02] <%shruke> only reason you would is if you want to hide things under the floor
[5:20:03] <akitanito> because they want to make you question yourself
[5:20:03] <%CommanderSqueaks> Literally everyone is saying different things.
[5:20:06] <Zaphire_Saucypants> probably for higher towers
[5:20:06] <mae_bun> Also, you can put foundations over the resource nodes to pretty them up
[5:20:06] <%Broand> Aesthetics for a teeny gap that you'll never see
[5:20:08] <Karebuncle> It used to be cheaper i think, oh well
[5:20:09] <+Pixel_Matt> wow
[5:20:09] <CappuccinoGuil> It doesn't give you more room, it's the height that's different, guys
[5:20:10] <BwdYeti> On the ground level there's no reason not to use all tall boys
[5:20:11] <%tank7013> Small is smaller, might look better in some places
[5:20:14] <VritraReiRei> Hello @PatStaresAt ! Just got here and I hope you are having a fun time playing your creativity game
[5:20:19] <Zaphire_Saucypants> that way you can literally have conveyor belts doing under your 2nd floor
[5:20:20] <T_Sasquatch> i dont know anything :)
[5:20:20] <blink289> granted depending on how high you plan on going it wont matter
[5:20:21] <%Broken_Sonex> Valheim doesn't have INDUSTRY. FOUNDATION. psaBougie
[5:20:22] <Jontman42> just do whatever the goblins will show the way
[5:20:24] <blastazoid00> Have you found any spooders?
[5:20:27] <$QueequegTheater> SCREEEEE
[5:20:27] <Zaphire_Saucypants> that's my guess
[5:20:28] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Stand on ground and spam at far wall to build foundations quickly
[5:20:29] <tanklets> When building stairs and roads later its good to mix the sizes. Trucks had trouble going up steep inclines
[5:20:31] <%Broand> That noise gets worse when you automate power
[5:20:32] <zazzera01> better get used to it LUL
[5:20:33] <mae_bun> Wait until you have to hear the chainsaw noise over and over again
[5:20:37] <%Wurmspawn> The more advance foundation variations will cost less, but all the original foundation platforms cost the same despite the size difference.
[5:20:37] <Veluren> That noise sucks to hear but at least it immediately tells you what it is
[5:20:41] <CappuccinoGuil> @PatStaresAt 8x1 foundation is good for VERTICAL factories. Occupies less space upwards
[5:20:44] <%FacetiousAF> these numbers, mason. they are smol
[5:20:44] <zedravan> "who hurt mah baby?!"
[5:20:44] <+HitchhikingThrough> It's a start
[5:20:46] <akitanito> how much concrete was that?
[5:20:46] <$QueequegTheater> WE NEED MORE LAND
[5:20:47] <blink289> haha i love the power fialure noise
[5:20:48] <ergulor> for both of us
[5:20:50] <tanklets> Its a good thing concrete produces so fast
[5:20:51] <%Monkeyweed21> IT BEGINS
[5:20:52] <EvanDude47> build vertical
[5:20:52] <s1rcuit> @mae_bun I hate it
[5:20:52] <tanklets> You will need a lot
[5:20:52] <%shruke> that noise is worldwide btw
[5:20:54] <blink289> failure*
[5:20:57] <SilverSnowFFXIV> Time to put only enough biomass to get it off E once again.
[5:20:59] <EvanDude47> upward factory
[5:21:02] <gryffinp> The good news is that the foundations enable you to pack things much more tightly
[5:21:02] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> you can built up too
[5:21:04] <$QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Multiple floors tho
[5:21:06] <Jakerham_Lincoln> @PatStaresAt Build the biggest cube you can. Become cube
[5:21:06] <%Broken_Sonex> WE NEED TO TAKE MORE OF THE LAND
[5:21:07] <%CommanderSqueaks> Can he build multiple floors for his foundation?
[5:21:11] <+EmotionalFatGuy> to much power
[5:21:13] <mae_bun> @s1rcuit I have to turn my game down when I collect biomass
[5:21:16] <+Strigiform> that dip means a generator ran out of fuel
[5:21:18] <xbb1024> one of your generators ran out
[5:21:18] <blastazoid00> f
[5:21:19] <BwdYeti> Something is out of fuel
[5:21:20] <+ReallyBigRocks> outta juice
[5:21:21] <+EmotionalFatGuy> power draw*
[5:21:23] <%Wurmspawn> You generators run out of materials separately.
[5:21:23] <Jontman42> make the number bigger Pat
[5:21:26] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt burner's empty
[5:21:27] <blink289> you either ran out of power or fuel
[5:21:29] <$QueequegTheater> ghetto
[5:21:30] <MidnightDeacon> Storm King
[5:21:31] <+HitchhikingThrough> it's kinda funky ngl
[5:21:36] <Veluren> Your grid is very convusing
[5:21:36] <CappuccinoGuil> @commanderclaw sure can. It's Minecraft rules. As long as it connects and snaps, you can build
[5:21:38] <+ReallyBigRocks> It's kinda a nightmare
[5:21:39] <blink289> build more gennys or add fuel
[5:21:40] <%DianaTheAscian> its finnnneee
[5:21:42] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat, for your foundation, I think you can make multiple levels.
[5:21:45] <%DorianCreed> Need fuel in the dedicated reactor
[5:21:45] <tanklets> @CommanderSqueaks  He can but he'll need to buy stairs from the shop for it to look good
[5:21:45] <akitanito> "a little bit"
[5:21:46] <s1rcuit> @mae_bun I don't blame you
[5:21:48] <$QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt First power grid is always a mess
[5:21:49] <LVL1_Scumbag> ya think?
[5:21:49] <%justcallmebobplease> You feeling the goblins?
[5:21:51] <Griffin1171> but it's your mess
[5:21:53] <KShirahama> It's fine
[5:21:54] <SixthShinx> Fucking direct current power lines up in here with this mess
[5:21:58] <blink289> wait till you get into oil power
[5:22:03] <EuropanLamprey> I called it at the beginning of the stream
[5:22:03] <%Broand> You can unlock more organized power grid stuff with the AWESOME sink, but it's a little bit of a hassle to make one
[5:22:07] <CappuccinoGuil> First power grid is always fucky, don't worry, you're learning
[5:22:15] <the_zealdeal> GAMEPLAY!
[5:22:15] <%Broand> Like walls and wall mounted sockets and stuff
[5:22:17] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Foundations float if you delete the one under them. Very useful.
[5:22:18] <+ReallyBigRocks> gotta get that biofuel constructor up
[5:22:18] <%Broken_Sonex> FEEL the goblins. FEEL them. psaGoblin
[5:22:27] <r0termond> Pat i love you
[5:22:27] <mae_bun> @PatStaresAt yes
[5:22:28] <%Broand> Constructor
[5:22:28] <tanklets> Kinda
[5:22:30] <KShirahama> yes
[5:22:32] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt after a while it's actually a good idea to rebuild it since you have a better understanding of things
[5:22:32] <gryffinp> Sure, do it in a constructor
[5:22:32] <Veluren> Not this part, gotta do machine automation or bust
[5:22:36] <%Jekado> biofuel yes
[5:22:38] <+D00msDayDan> assemblers can make biofuel
[5:22:39] <%Monkeyweed21> not biomass
[5:22:41] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Constructors.
[5:22:46] <mae_bun> I use a macro to hold down space
[5:22:46] <Orenjevel> is this a 1st person factorio
[5:22:47] <+ReallyBigRocks> you can automate the crafting but not the fueling
[5:22:48] <BwdYeti> Make a crate, put leaves in it, connect to a constructor
[5:22:51] <blink289> In my game i made all my power lines on a floor in the sky then deleted the floor underneath them and then wala floating power
[5:22:51] <%tank7013> Hand manufacturing is kinda bad on purpose to encourage automating everything
[5:22:51] <$HyperionXV> At minimum you'll have to dump leaves and wood into crates for constructors to proccess
[5:22:52] <%Broand> you have to hand feed the machines tho
[5:22:56] <%Jekado> you can automate the making of biomass
[5:22:59] <CappuccinoGuil> Storage with biomass > constructor making fuel > Storage for the fuel
[5:23:02] <%Jekado> you can't automate the feeding
[5:23:03] <KShirahama> just use crates for I/O
[5:23:08] <%tank7013> Later on there's shit you simply cannot make by hand
[5:23:09] <blink289> you can use water power pat
[5:23:34] <blink289> with the right combos you can automate fuel and water to power
[5:23:41] <$QueequegTheater> Patopia is open for business
[5:23:48] <blink289> oil*
[5:23:49] <r0termond> Is this a HD Pat?
[5:23:49] <%TheWinged7> "just one more thing"
[5:24:06] <Blackwatch656> HD Pat is best Pat
[5:24:08] <%Broand> Just build it on the foundation
[5:24:10] <the_zealdeal> Destroy the earth for more power
[5:24:13] <$QueequegTheater> Why would you put it in your factory
[5:24:21] <+ReallyBigRocks> Thats just for aligning with machines
[5:24:29] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt it snaps to line up with production outputs
[5:24:33] <SixthShinx> Time for a splitter
[5:24:34] <%Broand> You're mining more copper than you're smelting so yeah something to optimizel ater
[5:24:38] <KShirahama> need more smelters
[5:24:47] <HeroToxiko> Splitter mhm
[5:24:57] <+Strigiform> so yeah depending on the node some miners generate enough ore to supply 3+ smelters at full capacity
[5:25:02] <xbb1024> hit V to find stuff from high up
[5:25:02] <r0termond> Is this a land Subnautica?
[5:25:04] <Griffin1171> I should buy a boat
[5:25:08] <+ReallyBigRocks> so the map is pretty big
[5:25:09] <+TheCrispyBoi> he likes to be tall
[5:25:10] <gryffinp> big world.
[5:25:13] <$QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Use a splitter and build a second smelter
[5:25:13] <%Broand> You can explore anywhere you see good footing in the distance
[5:25:14] <NitronStreams> Man this game is pretty
[5:25:14] <mae_bun> Rush splitters and then coal power, Pat
[5:25:14] <Orenjevel> oo, look at that weird giraffe
[5:25:16] <%tank7013> Oh hey he built in the place my first factory was
[5:25:18] <%aishman> Are ya having fun Pat?
[5:25:19] <%tank7013> Neat
[5:25:20] <+reycharles75> how's the game Pat?
[5:25:32] <s1rcuit> @r0termond nah, you can kill here
[5:25:32] <+BusterRepukken> mean
[5:25:34] <$QueequegTheater> NOOOO BibleThump
[5:25:34] <%Jekado> they don't give anything
[5:25:35] <r0termond> omg
[5:25:38] <%ssjklyco> Take that wildlife
[5:25:42] <blink289> its non violent
[5:25:44] <akitanito> How did that thing not ruin all of your power lines?
[5:25:46] <blink289> and hard to kill
[5:25:47] <%Jekado> they can be killed it takes A WHILE
[5:25:49] <Orenjevel> you scared it pat, how could you
[5:25:53] <+ReallyBigRocks> you can bounce on their backs too
[5:25:56] <the_zealdeal> Holy shit that limbo monster is fast
[5:25:56] <s1rcuit> I call him "Blumpy"
[5:26:01] <%shruke> they nice balloon whales
[5:26:02] <$QueequegTheater> LEAVE HER ALONE
[5:26:04] <CappuccinoGuil> @akitanito because it'd make the game terrible if it did
[5:26:11] <Orenjevel> what a horrible air mattress monster, i love her
[5:26:13] <blink289> fly up to the big boy in the sky
[5:26:14] <penitentpendant> Time to get out the grid paper and PLAN
[5:26:22] <+Varnicrast> Would you say this game is...satisfactory?
[5:26:22] <r0termond> Oh no you are contaminating
[5:26:22] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt What if you mined both limestone points
[5:26:23] <%DorianCreed> "So I did some grinding off-stream..."
[5:26:24] <$QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Are you gonna start the next stream with everything turned into a cube hell
[5:26:27] <+ReallyBigRocks> HE GOT RID OF IT!
[5:26:29] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> i will happily watch that work, I'd love if you kept streaming this
[5:26:29] <zedravan> "so i grinded off stream"
[5:26:38] <CrematedCube> I never knew they could even run that fast
[5:26:38] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> You can grind offscreen forever without advancing milestones.
[5:26:43] <ammobasket> It’s a good first pass
[5:26:45] <Broken_Sonex> For one to build a foundation you must kill a lot of nature.
[5:26:46] <pyrotanis> is this first person factorio
[5:27:01] <%Broand> For now
[5:27:04] <%DorianCreed> @pyrotanis Kinda?
[5:27:08] <blink289> when i first started playing i would let the game run while i worked
[5:27:09] <mae_bun> The map is massive
[5:27:10] <%aishman> @pyrotanis Yes
[5:27:11] <%Jekado> yeah...
[5:27:11] <%depressed_skeleton> Build on Ocean
[5:27:13] <tanklets> Build UP
[5:27:15] <%Jekado> build higher
[5:27:16] <+TheBobulus> pave it?
[5:27:16] <$Trenr> no? I mean, build up
[5:27:16] <+Walopoh> probably
[5:27:16] <Psyramics> build up, stupid
[5:27:17] <s1rcuit> chainsaw
[5:27:17] <$SGrim> Build upwards
[5:27:18] <tanklets> Sky factory man
[5:27:18] <gryffinp> Yes, build
[5:27:18] <+EmotionalFatGuy> build in the sky
[5:27:20] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Build up.
[5:27:21] <+D00msDayDan> build up, there's no restriction on foundation
[5:27:21] <%Jekado> you can't destroy land
[5:27:21] <%tank7013> Foundations
[5:27:22] <Veluren> You can cut down trees and build vertically, this map is also unbelievably big
[5:27:22] <xbb1024> There's no bulldozers
[5:27:22] <%DorianCreed> Build Up
[5:27:24] <akitanito> think vertical
[5:27:27] <gryffinp> also yeah, building up is strong
[5:27:27] <$QueequegTheater> Multiple floors
[5:27:29] <%Jekado> or do what i did build in the ocean
[5:27:29] <Griffin1171> second floor, ma
[5:27:30] <wolfen091> yes, dethrone God build world in ur image
[5:27:30] <Griffin1171> man
[5:27:31] <SixthShinx> Just build up 4Head
[5:27:31] <blink289> can he build it
[5:27:32] <gryffinp> walls are a milestone I believe
[5:27:32] <BwdYeti> You can also cut down the plants
[5:27:32] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> You can't take the sky from me.
[5:27:32] <%Broand> Build up and outwards, you can't flatten ground
[5:27:32] <%depressed_skeleton> Build on Ocean or Build up, Yeah. Its dumb but it works for the brain goblins
[5:27:33] <+ReallyBigRocks> Not really, but this is just a small fraction of the map
[5:27:35] <blink289> yes he can
[5:27:36] <CrematedCube> New New York style
[5:27:36] <%Jekado> build in the void or ocean is what most players
[5:27:37] <mae_bun> In my second game, I built foundations over the map like a dyson sphere shell
[5:27:38] <+Rofiarf> multi floor factory
[5:27:38] <+Walopoh> oh yeah they said build vertical
[5:27:38] <NaderShahDidNothingWrong> Build /\
[5:27:39] <tanklets> Stupid big
[5:27:40] <%PinkSuprende> Nothing needs support, just build up with ramps
[5:27:40] <%tank7013> Map is HUGE
[5:27:43] <CappuccinoGuil> The map is MASSIVE, Pat
[5:27:43] <%Jekado> the map is HUGE
[5:27:43] <gryffinp> and then you can build walls and put floors on the wallss
[5:27:44] <+Rofiarf> oh yeah this is the first biome
[5:27:45] <tanklets> Theres also deserts and flatlands
[5:27:46] <%Monkeyweed21> you have conveyer elavators now
[5:27:47] <tanklets> like
[5:27:48] <akitanito> concrete tower of babylon
[5:27:48] <%Broand> You see those pink trees?
[5:27:49] <$QueequegTheater> All of it
[5:27:49] <%PinkSuprende> Everything
[5:27:50] <%Broken_Sonex> No no, build UP stupid!
[5:27:50] <$Trenr> all of it except the horizon
[5:27:51] <Veluren> There should be a keybind to see the world map?
[5:27:51] <tanklets> 5%
[5:27:51] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> It is very huge.
[5:27:51] <+Rofiarf> 10%
[5:27:52] <gryffinp> like 9%?
[5:27:52] <mae_bun> Like... 10% or less?
[5:27:52] <$SGrim> 5%
[5:27:53] <%PinkSuprende> Everything and more
[5:27:53] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Nothing
[5:27:53] <CrematedCube> All of it
[5:27:54] <wolfen091> 6
[5:27:54] <+doug_famous> Maybe 5%
[5:27:54] <%Jekado> 1/100th about?
[5:27:55] <s1rcuit> all of it
[5:27:55] <tanklets> At most
[5:27:55] <+Archphronimos> build everything on like the 4th floor, so you can make a massive flat plane
[5:27:55] <cyclone722> yes
[5:27:56] <%aishman> All
[5:27:56] <%DorianCreed> Eight of the 8x4 foundations straight up, stick a massive layer of 8x1s on top
[5:27:56] <+TheBobulus> like.... <5%?
[5:27:56] <BwdYeti> To the horizon, about 10%...?
[5:27:57] <blink289> a drop
[5:27:57] <moosemonkey397> 8ish%?
[5:27:59] <CappuccinoGuil> less than 10%
[5:28:00] <Tytangamer> Some of that shit on the horizon is real.
[5:28:00] <+ReallyBigRocks> You can see maybe a 1/6 of it right now
[5:28:00] <zedravan> nothing
[5:28:08] <$QueequegTheater> SEE THAT MOUNTAIN, YOU CAN GO THERE
[5:28:10] <tanklets> Thats radioactive town up there
[5:28:10] <+D00msDayDan> map is BIG
[5:28:11] <blink289> 001 percent
[5:28:12] <+ReallyBigRocks> One of the other biomes
[5:28:13] <+Rofiarf> north
[5:28:14] <CrematedCube> The desert is far far north
[5:28:16] <blink289> its so big
[5:28:17] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> No, that's your neighbor biome
[5:28:17] <tanklets> With the pink trees
[5:28:18] <%Jekado> desert is on the other side of the mountain biome
[5:28:18] <+Rofiarf> you are at the south of the map
[5:28:19] <akitanito> "You can climb that mountain!"
[5:28:27] <+RowenCleric> when it rains can you still climb rocks
[5:28:28] <%Broand> There is a map
[5:28:29] <tanklets> There is
[5:28:32] <%Jekado> Not yet
[5:28:32] <%Broand> you need to unlock it
[5:28:32] <%PinkSuprende> Map is a research
[5:28:32] <mae_bun> You unlock the map through research
[5:28:33] <Visorak6> Later
[5:28:34] <Orenjevel> Does this game have trains?
[5:28:34] <gryffinp> unlock the map
[5:28:34] <+doug_famous> There is a map eventually
[5:28:35] <+TheBobulus> you have to unlock the map!
[5:28:35] <+Rofiarf> you get one later
[5:28:35] <EvanDude47> map is a milestone
[5:28:36] <$HyperionXV> You have to research the map
[5:28:36] <+ReallyBigRocks> You get a map later
[5:28:36] <blink289> there is
[5:28:37] <xbb1024> the map is unlockable

[5:28:55] <+D00msDayDan> map spoilers
[5:28:55] <+TheBobulus> @PatStaresAt You can look at it now if you drop your save file into a website
[5:28:56] <s1rcuit> through a wiki I guess
[5:28:57] <%aishman> Isn't it randomly generated?
[5:28:57] <%Jekado> you can but do you know where you are now
[5:28:57] <ChungusQuest> instant gratification gang rise up
[5:28:57] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> It's fine
[5:28:58] <Tytangamer> Then google it you coward.
[5:28:58] <wolfen091> maybe when ur older
[5:28:58] <KShirahama> there is website
[5:29:01] <Ner234> Cheating D:
[5:29:02] <$QueequegTheater> BIG CHEATS
[5:29:02] <+PandaCavalry> press z
[5:29:03] <NitronStreams> Only if youre a filthy CHEATER
[5:29:04] <blink289> map online though
[5:29:04] <a_mad_dragon_> GET BACK TO WORK
[5:29:07] <tanklets> Theres an interactive map too
[5:29:08] <Orenjevel> You can, but thats a fun goal
[5:29:08] <+Strigiform> I spent 20+ minutes trying to find my start location on a map once
[5:29:09] <tanklets> On some sites
[5:29:11] <gryffinp> you're gonna have no fucking idea where you are on the map though
[5:29:13] <chaosbringer28> there are websites with the map
[5:29:14] <Megalofyte> 3rd party maps are way better and a killer spoilery
[5:29:14] <@SoFarFetched> LUL
[5:29:15] <chaosbringer28> for planning
[5:29:18] <xbb1024> there are interactive maps
[5:29:21] <$Trenr> southern area
[5:29:21] <%Jekado> yeah you can look it up online but its not really helpful
[5:29:23] <+Rofiarf> south green area
[5:29:28] <+ReallyBigRocks> The green bit at the bottom
[5:29:28] <NitronStreams> LUL
[5:29:29] <%Broand> Should be bottom left
[5:29:29] <KShirahama> south
[5:29:30] <+doug_famous> Towards the bottom middle
[5:29:32] <akitanito> Use the pink biome for reference I guess
[5:29:34] <%Broand> roughly
[5:29:39] <%RyTYoung> you are idunno
[5:29:42] <%Jekado> if you are using the interactive map there is an option for starting locations
[5:29:47] <+TheBobulus> Pat, there are websites you can drag and drop your savefile into to show where on the map you are
[5:29:50] <+Rofiarf> we cant see it pat
[5:29:56] <%Jekado> you are in the lower left starting location
[5:30:10] <+ReallyBigRocks> THE REALIZATION
[5:30:14] <$Trenr> yes
[5:30:17] <%JumboCrunchies> Yes
[5:30:18] <%Broand> Oh yeah
[5:30:19] <%Jekado> yep
[5:30:21] <tanklets> Ohh yeah
[5:30:22] <akitanito> pat spoiled
[5:30:22] <+ReallyBigRocks> MAP BIG

[5:30:26] <+vaderxyz1970> PLANET
[5:30:27] <tanklets> Big map for big boys
[5:30:27] <%Broand> they're STARTING biome
[5:30:27] <%JumboCrunchies> It is large
[5:30:28] <%Jekado> those are just starting locations
[5:30:28] <blink289> and caves
[5:30:29] <$Trenr> this map is FUCKING HUGE
[5:30:30] <Captain_Joe1911> uyuyuyuTokichan ?
[5:30:32] <blink289> lots of caves
[5:30:33] <tanklets> Plus underground caves
[5:30:36] <+TheCrispyBoi> big map
[5:30:37] <zedravan> map spoilers
[5:30:37] <penitentpendant> Sounds like a lot of content
[5:30:38] <Manwad> map's huge and you must exploit all of it
[5:30:39] <xbb1024> it's a large island
[5:30:40] <blink289> with plutonium
[5:30:42] <mae_bun> Also, somehow the recommended starter biome is crap. I think it's to force you to take your time and learn slowly.
[5:30:43] <gryffinp> yeah, you asked us how much you could SEE and we told you 5-10%
[5:30:45] <SilverSnowFFXIV> You havn't even started.  lol
[5:30:53] <%Broand> And the bizarre thing is that belts work regardless of distance
[5:30:55] <CrematedCube> I basically beat this without exploring half the map
[5:30:56] <Megalofyte> there's tons of caves too
[5:31:09] <gryffinp> until your burners die
[5:31:15] <Visorak6> until it runs out of power mid-donations

[5:31:37] <clockworknait1> this game makes my computer go wannnnnhhh
[5:31:38] <%Monkeyweed21> ORANGE PAT
[5:31:45] <CappuccinoGuil> You planning on streaming more of this?
[5:31:45] <blink289> shoulda taken a screenshot
[5:31:48] <penitentpendant> A "Pat and Chat" game?
[5:31:48] <%Monkeyweed21> why is Pat in California?
[5:31:49] <blink289> and put it up
[5:31:49] <mae_bun> @PatStaresAt if you like Satisfactory, you should check out Dyson Sphere Program some time. I put in like 8- hours the past two weeks.
[5:31:50] <$Afterman_> color shift
[5:31:51] <+queaks> @PatStaresAt Would you play this with friends?
[5:31:52] <wolfen091> orange 1080p pat
[5:31:59] <tanklets> Im glad you're liking it Pat. Ive been playing this listening to the podcast for so long now
[5:32:03] <%rumtumtugnutz> that blue shirt still fucks the color balance
[5:32:06] <%Jekado> i wouldn't play too much until AFTER update 4
[5:32:07] <+D00msDayDan> i'm looking forward to "so i did some grinding off stream" for this game
[5:32:16] <%notoriousvt_> notoriousvt_ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months! I'm glad you liked Satisfactory!
[5:32:25] <blink289> that was the conveyerbelt update
[5:32:35] <+D00msDayDan> TRAAAAINS
[5:32:36] <+Walopoh> Also you could easily do the timestamp from when you were frozen on the still shot in-game
[5:32:37] <+TheBobulus> Pipes!!!!
[5:32:37] <blink289> thats probably not the original trailer
[5:32:38] <$Afterman_> pat gettin pipped...
[5:32:38] <$Trenr> yeah, pipes were the last update I think
[5:32:38] <+queaks> Pipes are the shit
[5:32:39] <tanklets> Thats the new update lol yeah
[5:32:39] <+TipsyND> Pipe was so hype
[5:32:41] <gryffinp> pipes were a highly anticipated feature in update 3
[5:32:41] <KShirahama> yeah
[5:32:41] <%Broand> FUCK YEAH PIPES
[5:32:42] <xbb1024> yeah, there's pipes
[5:32:42] <zedravan> POG

[5:32:45] <Coystick> Respect the pipe
[5:32:46] <+queaks> They are adding Gas next update
[5:32:46] <akitanito> is this metroid
[5:32:48] <CappuccinoGuil> Pipes were a HIGHLY requested feature by the community
[5:32:48] <%Jekado> liquids
[5:32:49] <wolfen091> the colors on pats aren't perfectly calibrated
[5:32:49] <+doug_famous> For real though
[5:32:50] <+Walopoh> New update
[5:32:52] <clockworknait1> I still love belts over pipes, in the game and the bedroom
[5:32:55] <%Jekado> AND NOW GASSES are being added
[5:32:56] <+TheBobulus> pipes follow liquid physics
[5:32:57] <+EmotionalFatGuy> liquids
[5:32:57] <%DakotaMacDoodle> your not ready for pipes pat
[5:32:58] <Tytangamer> Are you ready now?
[5:32:58] <cyclone722> the devs are very silly
[5:32:59] <%Broand> Like you used to have to package water and transport it on belts
[5:32:59] <tanklets> They were new
[5:32:59] <$Trenr> liquids are cool.
[5:32:59] <gryffinp> oil
[5:32:59] <+Rofiarf> you need water for some stuff
[5:33:00] <%furiousfurioso> for liquids like oil
[5:33:00] <%notoriousvt_> gotta pipe down
[5:33:01] <EvanDude47> liquids
[5:33:02] <+queaks> How do you get water Pat?
[5:33:04] <blink289> futurama tube yourself pat
[5:33:05] <+doug_famous> Liquids and gases
[5:33:05] <penitentpendant> "Fuck Yeah Pipes" the "Fuck Belts" of Satisfactory
[5:33:05] <%JumboCrunchies> People like pipes.
[5:33:06] <akitanito> piiiiiiiipppppppppeeeeeeeeessssss
[5:33:06] <%Jekado> crude oil
[5:33:06] <CappuccinoGuil> Community kept begging for it
[5:33:06] <+Javaa01> Everyone wanted pipes
[5:33:06] <zedravan> fluids
[5:33:08] <CrematedCube> Vacuum tubes are the SHIT tho
[5:33:08] <%shurtal> you don't know about PIPES
[5:33:09] <+TipsyND> Hey kids, do you like fluid mechanics?
[5:33:09] <+ReallyBigRocks> That's a trailer for the most recent update @PatStaresAt
[5:33:10] <wolfen091> pipes are to be respected in this house
[5:33:10] <%Monkeyweed21> Gas and Liquids
[5:33:11] <NitronStreams> He doesnt even Know?!
[5:33:11] <mae_bun> You have to deal with head lift with pipes
[5:33:13] <xbb1024> All that gas you saw, soon you can do something with it
[5:33:13] <+vaderxyz1970> Clean burning propane
[5:33:13] <+dr_leo_stache> they're there to pipe you up
[5:33:14] <%DorianCreed> Oil, water
[5:33:15] <%AncelDeLambert> what, you expect a BELT to deal with liquids?
[5:33:15] <blink289> im not joking
[5:33:15] <LVL1_Scumbag> For liquids and gases
[5:33:16] <+MrJackett> Just in case belts weren't hype enough for you
[5:33:17] <+ChampionBob> Does that mean you get it now or it's not clicking?
[5:33:17] <$Trenr> you can now use water and oil and all kinds of good shit
[5:33:18] <%asgard147> FUCKIN' PIPES BRO! limesPoggers
[5:33:18] <blink289> futurama tube
[5:33:19] <Orenjevel> pipes are like ziplines for liquid
[5:33:20] <%shurtal> BROTHER
[5:33:20] <%Fooguwu> LIQUIIIIIIID
[5:33:21] <%tank7013> And soon is GAS
[5:33:23] <iosephe> PIPES
[5:33:25] <%DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt are u okay?
[5:33:28] <+Walopoh> Liquids AND GASSES
[5:33:28] <blink289> oil
[5:33:29] <%AncelDeLambert> gotta work with fluid somehow, man
[5:33:30] <+queaks> @PatStaresAt Did you know you can find harddrives in the game that unlock ALTERNATE RECIPES
[5:33:30] <%furiousfurioso> you can also make a man pipe to transport yourself
[5:33:31] <gryffinp> oil and water and sulfuric acid
[5:33:32] <akitanito> SNAKEEEEEE
[5:33:34] <$Trenr> it came to steam in june
[5:33:34] <clockworknait1> does pats pipe not produce liquid?
[5:33:36] <%notoriousvt_> EGS first
[5:33:37] <Tytangamer> YOU WANT THAT SWEET CRUDE?
[5:33:37] <tanklets> Hell yeah man
[5:33:38] <%Broand> It was on Epic game store
[5:33:38] <CappuccinoGuil> On Steam
[5:33:38] <Megalofyte> pipes are like fast belts
[5:33:40] <%AncelDeLambert> psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin
[5:33:40] <gryffinp> no it was in the epic games prison for a while longer
[5:33:40] <+TheBobulus> June 2019, iirc
[5:33:41] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt You can transport limestone faster through a watered pipe than conveyor, then there's gas and water and such
[5:33:41] <%depressed_skeleton> June last year? feels longer...
[5:33:41] <Veluren> This game's been around for a while but it was Epic Exclusive until June
[5:33:41] <%Jekado> on steam
[5:33:41] <+MrJackett> No, pipes since June
[5:33:43] <bonebagMEL> 1 year in Epic store
[5:33:44] <Tisaric> no it had an Epic exlusive period
[5:33:45] <Visorak6> steam release was june
[5:33:45] <akitanito> Is there natural gas
[5:33:45] <CappuccinoGuil> EGS first release
[5:33:45] <BwdYeti> It was on epic
[5:33:49] <%Jekado> it was EGS... for a while
[5:33:50] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Epic games store
[5:33:53] <%AncelDeLambert> @PatStaresAt it released a year ago as Epic exclusive
[5:33:54] <+Walopoh> Lost in the shadow realm
[5:33:54] <%PinkSuprende> Also the entire campaign and story isn't made yet
[5:33:54] <%Broand> if you remember it was the first thing they went exclusive back in the day
[5:33:55] <Shwepie> I don't think Pat is being satisfied by Satisfactory, more overwhelmed it seems.
[5:33:58] <%DorianCreed> So yeah, since June
[5:33:59] <%PinkSuprende> It's just sandbox rn
[5:33:59] <CrematedCube> It was on Epic before that, hit Steam in June
[5:34:00] <gryffinp> pipes was the update when they put it on steam
[5:34:01] <CappuccinoGuil> EVEN THEN the EGS release was rock solid
[5:34:03] <kazadaz> Pat hast though considered Dyson Sphere Project?
[5:34:05] <blink289> its still been polished since i got it in march
[5:34:07] <+queaks> Currently theres no ending though
[5:34:12] <Tisaric> it's good fun
[5:34:14] <penitentpendant> EGS, where games go to have Early Access and Money
[5:34:21] <%AncelDeLambert> Factorio is pretty dope
[5:34:22] <+HitchhikingThrough> this is correct
[5:34:23] <clockworknait1> factorio is hard-core though
[5:34:24] <%XeroSigmaPrime> But less pretty
[5:34:24] <%depressed_skeleton> Same but flat
[5:34:25] <%JumboCrunchies> But uglier!
[5:34:27] <CrematedCube> It is, just 2D
[5:34:29] <+BusterRepukken> not relaxing
[5:34:29] <%Wurmspawn> I went afk to get ice cream why does pat look like he got broken?
[5:34:29] <blink289> story is where all the ea is
[5:34:29] <+PandaCavalry> yup
[5:34:29] <%AncelDeLambert> that's because this is 3D Factorio
[5:34:29] <BwdYeti> Factorio is more hardcore but 2D basically, also lots of mods
[5:34:30] <Tisaric> Factorio is this game on adderall
[5:34:30] <+HitchhikingThrough> they're both based off the same minecraft mod pack
[5:34:31] <CappuccinoGuil> With guns and tower defense
[5:34:31] <+PandaCavalry> basically
[5:34:31] <+queaks> Factorio you need to defeend your base
[5:34:31] <xbb1024> it's older
[5:34:32] <+Walopoh> No defenses though
[5:34:32] <A0N33> Yeah more or less
[5:34:32] <%hamborgini> factorio has way more combat
[5:34:33] <gryffinp> except aliens try to kill you
[5:34:34] <+Bail_Seven> and ugly
[5:34:35] <+Javaa01> Factorio was first, and has way better modding
[5:34:35] <%DorianCreed> But flat and 2nd person
[5:34:36] <Manwad> 2D and bugs
[5:34:36] <+PersonifiedTFT> so Pat how many more satisfactory streams are you gonna do this week
[5:34:36] <$Trenr> 3d is a big difference. also, factorio enemies will attack your shit.
[5:34:36] <+TheCrispyBoi> yup
[5:34:37] <+TheMorilo> It gets crazier
[5:34:37] <+doug_famous> Factorio is was more complex
[5:34:37] <%VoidBaronJules> and limited resources
[5:34:39] <+PersonifiedTFT> Yes
[5:34:39] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> but a tougher game and a bit easier on crap computers
[5:34:40] <$Futurecity10> Factorio would break pat
[5:34:40] <zedravan> way more hardcore tho'
[5:34:40] <LVL1_Scumbag> Pretty much, it's top down
[5:34:40] <%DorianCreed> Yep
[5:34:41] <Psyramics> the mechanics are way different
[5:34:42] <Megalofyte> factorio is more complex
[5:34:43] <T_Sasquatch> factorio is way more hardcore
[5:34:43] <%Monkeyweed21> Do you enjoy being the villain in a James Cameron movie?
[5:34:45] <kazadaz> Non-infinite resources
[5:34:45] <CappuccinoGuil> Factorio has more defense and combat
[5:34:46] <Orenjevel> except you're a baldurs gate man
[5:34:47] <+TipsyND> You don't have to fight polution here
[5:34:48] <+Walopoh> Factorio you have to defend from aliens @PatStaresAt
[5:34:48] <+HitchhikingThrough> Feed the Beast
[5:34:48] <Tytangamer> And resources aren't infinite.
[5:34:49] <+EmotionalFatGuy> Dyson sphere program is Factorio but on a galactic scale
[5:34:49] <%SilvaChariot0133> Technic stuff yeah
[5:34:49] <%TheLeadingTone> i personally prefer factorio for spider-bot
[5:34:50] <penitentpendant> The Pat is tired
[5:34:50] <blink289> satisfactorio has combat tho
[5:34:53] <+TheBobulus> there's more exploration in Satisfactory because it's 1st person
[5:34:56] <+PandaCavalry> and factorio your pollution cause the monsters to come attack you
[5:34:56] <ammobasket> Factorio is grunge
[5:34:56] <+BusterRepukken> Factorio is harder
[5:34:56] <%Jekado> Dyson Sphere is a weird hybrid
[5:34:57] <%tank7013> Factorio has more focus on combat
[5:34:59] <%Wurmspawn> There was actually a meme about one of the devs "getting caught" playign Factorio.
[5:34:59] <%DorianCreed> Words
[5:34:59] <Megalofyte> there's also dyson sphere program
[5:35:01] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt I love your verbal tics
[5:35:01] <T_Sasquatch> i've seen literally centrifugal engines in factorio
[5:35:03] <+queaks> Satisfactory is the chiller expereince
[5:35:08] <Flakari> They aren't but get huge
[5:35:09] <+D00msDayDan> you can set resources to infinite in factorio i think
[5:35:12] <kazadaz> Factorio was made by computer engineers who decided to make a game
[5:35:12] <%darklordfodder> Factorio also basically includes Railroad Tycoon in it
[5:35:13] <Psyramics> coward
[5:35:13] <%Jekado> Factorio is more.. tower defensy
[5:35:15] <CrematedCube> The lack of third dimension makes Factorio overall tougher
[5:35:16] <%AncelDeLambert> coward
[5:35:16] <+Onionchamp> And that the world is actively trying to kill you in factorio
[5:35:16] <mae_bun> Check out Dyson Sphere Program for something more like Factorio and super fucking dope
[5:35:18] <+Javaa01> Yes, they are both effectively Technic Pack turned into actual games
[5:35:19] <%Dunmarkh> you gotta build trains and nuclear weapons in factorio
[5:35:19] <+D00msDayDan> also world gen in factorio is infinite
[5:35:20] <BwdYeti> There are mods for infinite
[5:35:22] <LVL1_Scumbag> They can be modded to be infinite
[5:35:22] <wolfen091> but number go up oat
[5:35:24] <NitronStreams> Might as well not even exist
[5:35:24] <clockworknait1> its not that hard pat ya baby
[5:35:26] <%Broken_Sonex> NEVER. EVER,
[5:35:29] <+queaks> 3D > 2D anyway
[5:35:32] <Tisaric> Factorio has a bunch that is way more involved and yeah resources are way more of an issue
[5:35:33] <%Jekado> Dyson Sphere can be set to infinite resources also
[5:35:35] <BwdYeti> But it's also procedural maps
[5:35:36] <kazadaz> I mean there are infinite resources, you just have to make train lines out to them
[5:35:37] <EvanDude47> mobs aggro at pollution in factorio
[5:35:38] <+OwlLightningMage> How does that make sense
[5:35:40] <+UltraViolet371> are resources in dyson sphere infinite?
[5:35:44] <Coystick> Pat entropy is real
[5:35:50] <tanklets> Its measured
[5:35:51] <+HitchhikingThrough> I've seen some nonsense
[5:35:52] <tanklets> It fits
[5:35:53] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Welcome to crafting games
[5:35:53] <blink289> so little you've explored too
[5:35:55] <mae_bun> @UltraViolet371 no, but you can make them infinite
[5:35:56] <$Trenr> there's so much content, and it's still not finished
[5:35:56] <Tisaric> that's incremental games baby
[5:35:57] <+vaderxyz1970> Make Willy Wonka look like a bitch
[5:35:58] <tanklets> Its solving small problems
[5:36:01] <%Monkeyweed21> COVER THE PLANET IN CONCRETE AND METAL
[5:36:02] <%blastyoboots> Pat it's so satisfying. It's so SO SATISFYING. You UNDERSTAND now!
[5:36:03] <Manwad> he's gonna have the efficiency dream. we all had it
[5:36:03] <+queaks> Satisfactory is only an upwards climb. There are 0 setbacks
[5:36:04] <+OwlLightningMage> How does a building game work without infinite resources?
[5:36:05] <NitronStreams> You havent even gotten to the vehicles yet
[5:36:06] <ChungusQuest> the only limit is your PC
[5:36:10] <+Javaa01> @PatStaresAt The map in Factorio is infinite, it generates as you go
[5:36:12] <%VoidBaronJules> more in depth cookie clicker game, nnumber go up good
[5:36:12] <%toastybites> havent people already made hyperloops
[5:36:13] <mr_slaide> WE DEMAND ELMO!!!!
[5:36:14] <+UltraViolet371> @mae_bun gotcha, good enough
[5:36:15] <kazadaz> Pat have you heard of MineCraft??
[5:36:15] <gryffinp> sometimes you see people post pictures of gigafactories with a bajillion everything, but they all use mods so you just call them cheaters and go back to your funtime kidz factory
[5:36:16] <mae_bun> @PatStaresAt know about buses and manifolds yet?
[5:36:17] <blink289> look at some shit people did on youtube
[5:36:17] <$Trenr> you've barely scratched the surface.
[5:36:22] <%Broand> And even exploring the map feels good
[5:36:23] <+PandaCavalry> but then your energy requirement gets outa control
[5:36:24] <Megalofyte> factorio is still better because you can automate everything, even base building
[5:36:27] <+red_cuppa> lmao lil bit yeah
[5:36:27] <blink289> its conveyor heaven
[5:36:29] <%depressed_skeleton> Lil bit
[5:36:29] <%TheLeadingTone> oh yeah
[5:36:29] <+queaks> Not that ive noticed
[5:36:30] <+ArmoredDeath> dekillMonke
[5:36:30] <Tisaric> oh yes
[5:36:31] <mae_bun> The auto save gets baaaaad
[5:36:35] <+queaks> Its very well optomized
[5:36:36] <%Jekado> Satisfactory doesn't really have a fail state... its just efficency and machine bigger.
[5:36:37] <%Wurmspawn> 'it get crunchier in
[5:36:38] <+TheCrispyBoi> oh yeah
[5:36:39] <tanklets> It can
[5:36:40] <+doug_famous> It has to be HUGE before that happens
[5:36:40] <+ReallyBigRocks> Of course, but that's to be expected
[5:36:41] <tanklets> Spread that shit
[5:36:41] <Manwad> there's a guy who made some real jank shit, it's hilarious
[5:36:43] <xbb1024> used to, but they've optimised it a bit
[5:36:43] <mae_bun> Like a 2 second hitch
[5:36:43] <gryffinp> Satisfactory is impressively optimized but you can definitely bring it to its knees if you TRY HARD
[5:36:44] <jaketherelapses> what's up pat
[5:36:45] <%AncelDeLambert> they've worked very hard on optimizing
[5:36:45] <%DorianCreed> It can, yeah
[5:36:45] <Tytangamer> Like a lot a lot.
[5:36:45] <%Broand> your factory works  even if you're miles away though
[5:36:46] <%tank7013> Oh you can make that shit unplayable with enough of a megafactory
[5:36:46] <mr_slaide> Kind of.
[5:36:47] <blink289> depends
[5:36:47] <%Wurmspawn> in MP, but single player is pretty good.
[5:36:48] <%Monkeyweed21> Once your factory gets bigger than the biomes @PatStaresAt
[5:36:48] <%MelBrooksKA> These games are very memory intense
[5:36:49] <%Broand> which is bizarre to me
[5:36:49] <blink289> spread it out
[5:36:53] <+TheBobulus> it's pretty reasonable. Mine only crunches during the save, and it looks like they've improved that
[5:36:54] <blink289> and train to place to place
[5:36:55] <CrematedCube> It runs really surprisingly smooth for what it is
[5:36:55] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt Playing through Nioh 2 while watching you. This shit is good, but I really hate the lootershooter part of it so much useless fluff
[5:36:57] <LVL1_Scumbag> If there's one thing Factorio has over Satisfactory, it's optimization
[5:37:00] <%darklordfodder> Factorio has blueprints and construction bots.
[5:37:00] <%valriot> You can create low frame rate worlds, and do crazy shit
[5:37:04] <+vaderxyz1970> We gonna get more of this?
[5:37:08] <+PandaCavalry> another one that is kinda in the same realm is dyson sphere
[5:37:15] <jaketherelapses> play a good game
[5:37:16] <CappuccinoGuil> You should do more of this
[5:37:17] <+queaks> @PatStaresAt How will you sell woolie on it the podcast
[5:37:19] <+HitchhikingThrough> I think the last time I saw you like this was 75% off for warcraft
[5:37:23] <%DorianCreed> There's a dude on the Youtubes who made a giant fuckin' conveyor belt tornado that's like a kilometre high. That'd tank anyone's rig
[5:37:24] <+D00msDayDan> you should watch letsgameitout's factorio videos, they're works of art
[5:37:24] <+HitchhikingThrough> *warframe
[5:37:26] <%gear1033> @PatStaresAt MandaloreGaming has a great review of factorio that you should watch.
[5:37:27] <mae_bun> Things phase out when you're away from them. You can watch the automated trucks start teleporting around at a distance
[5:37:28] <%Jekado> Satisfactory multiplayer is broken tho...
[5:37:29] <kazadaz> DSP !
[5:37:29] <+D00msDayDan> fuck i mean satisfactory
[5:37:31] <CrematedCube> Dyson = This + Kerbal
[5:37:33] <+queaks> 2
[5:37:33] <Veluren> There's a project in Satisfactory called "the cocoon" if you ever want to look it up, it's absurd
[5:37:39] <+ReallyBigRocks> So if you don't stream this often we better get regular Patisfactory updates
[5:37:42] <+queaks> @PatStaresAt Would you play with friends?
[5:37:45] <blink289> funny shit happens in multiplayer
[5:37:49] <+ReallyBigRocks> I wanna see your shit get huge
[5:37:50] <%Monkeyweed21> BECOME THE VILLAIN OF A JAMES CAMERON MOVIE
[5:37:52] <+TensecondTarvis> @PatStaresAt they are currently switching engine to newer version, so its getting better. also the updte coming soon is bringing more content
[5:37:59] <Tisaric> sseth's is so fucking good
[5:38:06] <BwdYeti> yeyeyeyeyeye
[5:38:07] <Tisaric> yup
[5:38:17] <$zyberion626> cascading failure baby!
[5:38:17] <DestroPrime83> @PatStaresAt are you ever gonna try Journey To The Savage Planet?
[5:38:18] <+Walopoh> Have you heard about Loop Hero? It comes out tomorrow.
[5:38:19] <kazadaz> Dyson SPhere Project my man
[5:38:26] <Tisaric> that's factorio for you baby
[5:38:28] <%Dunmarkh> factorio feels like fucking starship troopers on higher difficulties
[5:38:29] <+Javaa01> Yeah that's the first thing you need to learn by doing
[5:38:30] <mae_bun> ^
[5:38:37] <+DaPlatinum98765> DaPlatinum98765 subscribed with Prime. 
[5:38:39] <%Broand> It's also multiplayer
[5:38:44] <LVL1_Scumbag> Which is why you go for flamethrowers and train artillery
[5:38:46] <jaketherelapses> congrats on getting enged tho pat
[5:38:46] <ChungusQuest> Space colony designed by Tim Taylor
[5:38:48] <%blastyoboots> @PatStaresAt You can understand now that you've played Satisfactory that the complexity looks intimidating when you look at a snapshot from 5 hours in, but when you're actually DOING IT it all feels natural, until you suddenly realize your brain has become the size of the sun
[5:38:51] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Glad you liked it
[5:38:54] <blink289> theres also that game astroneer
[5:39:11] <%hermitsen> hermitsen subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 25 months! 
[5:39:28] <+HitchhikingThrough> Wait sseth and mandalore did reviews?
[5:39:43] <%Broand> reviews of factorio
[5:39:44] <Tisaric> they did them of factorio not satisfactory
[5:39:51] <cyclone722> satisfactory can be a time void since it sets you up to wait
[5:39:53] <+HitchhikingThrough> ah
[5:40:16] <%Arancet> All Will Become Cube
[5:40:22] <%Broand> This was a real stream of consciousness stream
[5:40:46] <$Futurecity10> Wait, does Pat get US citizenship?
[5:41:14] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> you did!
[5:41:16] <+queaks> You did great
[5:41:16] <Darthkitten_Prime> You did pretty good!
[5:41:16] <%Broand> It was better than my start so
[5:41:17] <%mae_bun> It's not bad for a first factory
[5:41:29] <%MelBrooksKA> You dit
[5:41:31] <%AncelDeLambert> Automation
[5:41:34] <+doug_famous> ***
[5:41:35] <+Rofiarf> one came out recently
[5:41:35] <%Dunmarkh> modded minecraft
[5:41:36] <Tisaric> Astroneer is a little more exploration/space stuff
[5:41:37] <+queaks> Its.... chinese
[5:41:40] <+UltraViolet371> dyson sphere looks sick
[5:41:40] <+HitchhikingThrough> Feed the Beast or whatever the successor to that modpack was
[5:41:41] <%MisterRockett> Minecraft
[5:41:41] <+OwlLightningMage> Rimworld?
[5:41:42] <Tisaric> not exactly automation
[5:41:43] <%CapnClassix> @PatStaresAt You ever try RimWorld?
[5:41:44] <%Broand> not total spaghetti
[5:41:48] <BwdYeti> Modded Minecraft, obviously
[5:41:52] <%darklordfodder> Modded Minecraft
[5:41:52] <+EmotionalFatGuy> its great but it can get confusing
[5:41:52] <Slim_Lipid> shapezio ?
[5:41:53] <+Rofiarf> its good
[5:41:53] <%AncelDeLambert> Astroneer has nothing, man, I gave up on it so fast
[5:41:59] <%Broand> rimworld isn't automation
[5:42:01] <+OwlLightningMage> Kenshi? kinda?
[5:42:07] <+Rofiarf> you can go between planets!
[5:42:08] <%mae_bun> I think the art style in Dyson Sphere Program is neat, but it's not the prettiest. Still fucking love it tho.
[5:42:08] <+JustToWatch> is infinifactory a thing or am I making that up
[5:42:10] <%Broand> But it's like fledgling genre
[5:42:11] <Tisaric> yeah shapezio is a big one
[5:42:12] <%AncelDeLambert> it sucks so much to have to pay to move between worlds in Astroneer, it really fucks up your factories
[5:42:17] <CrematedCube> It's simple in visuals but amazing in scale
[5:42:18] <+queaks> Its
[5:42:21] <+Rofiarf> you can make a factory system that spans multiple planets
[5:42:24] <Tisaric> infinifactory is a puzzle game I believe
[5:42:25] <Slim_Lipid> any half decent farm life sim?
[5:42:33] <EvanDude47> infinifactory is a zachtronics game
[5:42:37] <+queaks> Hand crafted world is way better than procedurally generated
[5:42:38] <%Broand> There's a bunch of cheap indie ones
[5:42:38] <%AncelDeLambert> @JustToWatch Infinifactory is a puzzle game
[5:42:41] <+D00msDayDan> astroneer has some automation but it isn't the focus like these games
[5:42:42] <jcflyguy> Astroneer is so chill
[5:42:44] <EuropanLamprey> Does Kerbal Space Program count?  I imagine Pat's Golbins would so into hyperdrive tryint to make the Relay System line up perfectly
[5:42:45] <%Broand> Infinifactory is a puzzle game
[5:42:52] <Orenjevel> Does dwarf fortress count?
[5:42:52] <%Fooguwu> play minecraft again now coward
[5:42:52] <%darklordfodder> Space Engineers, kind of in the genre.
[5:43:05] <AlvinTheLiar> it is
[5:43:10] <%mae_bun> I'd die if Pat played Kerbal Space Program hypeE
[5:43:16] <%Broand> Spengies has a little bit of automation, but factorio is the pioneer in this field
[5:43:24] <%cvp5127> LUL
[5:43:25] <%AzureGale> LUL
[5:43:30] <Tisaric> Shapezio and Factory Town are similar in the automation aspect
[5:43:32] <%darklordfodder> Sky Factory Minecraft is different, but touches similar parts of the brain.
[5:43:33] <ChungusQuest> Skeet skeet for safety!
[5:43:37] <+queaks> Satisfactorio
[5:43:52] <Coystick> Disinfect me daddy
[5:43:53] <%Fooguwu> hold it in your heart
[5:44:06] <%Ranryu692> @PatStaresAt I sent you the video on Twitter if you want to check it out after the stream
[5:44:07] <Ravioli_Ronin> Not the Cummie Cam
[5:44:11] <mpo9> Pat help, I can't stop thinking of you doing Smash Bros. Wario Animations
[5:44:37] <+queaks> Its about limited resources IMO
[5:44:41] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> same
[5:45:00] <bettysharkface> Pat is a problem solver, not a pretty maker, creative type.
[5:45:00] <mr_slaide> Efficiency > Aesthetics
[5:45:06] <%AncelDeLambert> it'll look like a web
[5:45:08] <BwdYeti> Very much so
[5:45:11] <%asgard147> limesComfy
[5:45:15] <+queaks> Not to mention sound incredibly pleasing
[5:45:24] <%darklordfodder> Factorio has the added challenge of base defense.
[5:45:25] <%AncelDeLambert> THAT'S the part that sucks
[5:45:28] <Tisaric> oh yes
[5:45:31] <%CommanderSqueaks> Now Pat's thinking like a city planner
[5:45:31] <%AncelDeLambert> not wanting to start all over
[5:45:34] <Visorak6> Oh pat you dont want to look up how bad it can get
[5:45:36] <Tisaric> the good old spaghetti belts
[5:45:38] <%mae_bun> Make a bus for goods you heathen!
[5:45:40] <%SilvaChariot0133> psaBig Spaghetti
[5:45:42] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> There one thing in Satisfactory that gave me too many options and I couldn't take it.
[5:45:43] <+D00msDayDan> nothing more permanent than a temporary solution
[5:45:45] <%Broand> Spaghetti is the official term
[5:45:46] <%Ranryu692> that's how my grandfather built his house
[5:45:48] <+queaks> Big open area helps
[5:45:48] <Sunstalker> Yeah screw over future pat, that guy's an asshole anyway, he never did anything for you kinamaNo
[5:45:49] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> its nice you can pull things down for free
[5:45:51] <%VoidBaronJules> it's an aesthetic choice
[5:45:52] <Captain_Joe1911> tansy5Tuntun2 pastaThat
[5:45:53] <%AncelDeLambert> oh man, early Factorio spaghetti belts
[5:45:54] <CrematedCube> My first image of this game
[5:45:56] <mr_slaide> But what about Elmo?
[5:46:04] <cyclone722> me and my friend had some mad sky spagetti
[5:46:05] <CrematedCube> Was a mountain smothered in belts
[5:46:12] <Tisaric> yeah that's a huge deal in Valheim too
[5:46:24] <+Onionchamp> But just build around is so much easier
[5:46:27] <Dreigun> spaghetti factory is its own kind of beauty
[5:46:29] <+queaks> I like that progress is ALWAYS being made in satisfactory
[5:46:36] <Darthkitten_Prime> Smelters?
[5:46:38] <%darklordfodder> yeah
[5:46:38] <Darthkitten_Prime> Ah
[5:46:48] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Or right next to it.
[5:46:50] <%Broand> you create a smelter bloc, a constructor bloc, and an assembler bloc and a refinery bloc....
[5:46:50] <+doug_famous> Trains will help with that
[5:46:53] <+D00msDayDan> spacing it out means you have room for more inputs
[5:46:54] <CrematedCube> Pipelines! Fuck Nature!
[5:47:00] <+queaks> There is a reason the nodes are quite far apart
[5:47:07] <ammobasket> Depends
[5:47:08] <xbb1024> you create satellite facilities, that's why you get transport
[5:47:10] <Tisaric> yeah there's bigger methods of transport to help with that
[5:47:13] <%Broand> I split them up by resource
[5:47:24] <%darklordfodder> look into the concept of a main bus...idk if that's as much of a thing in Satisfactory
[5:47:26] <%CommanderSqueaks> Yes
[5:47:27] <+queaks> Youre going to dream about it tonight, so good luck with that
[5:47:28] <%Broand> There's trains
[5:47:31] <%Broand> there's trucks
[5:47:31] <%mae_bun> There are trucks and trains that are automated
[5:47:32] <+queaks> Yes and yes
[5:47:33] <%CommanderSqueaks> I believe so yes.
[5:47:35] <%Broand> and they're both automated
[5:47:37] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Depends. Too much resources in an area and you can construct them down into one belt of resources.
[5:47:39] <xbb1024> yes, you just have to design them right
[5:47:39] <%tank7013> Yep
[5:47:40] <+D00msDayDan> before you unlock trains you unlock tractors and trucks you can automate
[5:47:43] <%AncelDeLambert> yes you can automate the trains
[5:47:45] <%AncelDeLambert> it's just HARD
[5:47:47] <%Fooguwu> clickity clack down the tracj
[5:47:48] <Visorak6> truck automation is a pain in the ass
[5:47:51] <+queaks> And Hyper tubes like futurama to get around @PatStaresAt
[5:47:53] <%Dunmarkh> like factorio
[5:47:54] <CrematedCube> They are high level but yes, conducting power too
[5:47:54] <%Broand> there's also futurama style tube transport
[5:48:02] <%mae_bun> For truck automation, you drive the route and record it
[5:48:03] <xbb1024> they fall off cliffs
[5:48:06] <%AncelDeLambert> you mean track?
[5:48:07] <%Nekros4442> @PatStaresAt Are you thinking about checking out Loop Hero? It's another game published by Devolver
[5:48:08] <Tisaric> you have to  do it yourself
[5:48:09] <+D00msDayDan> you have to set the truck routes by driving them first
[5:48:10] <%Broand> for people not resources
[5:48:10] <Visorak6> because you record the route it drives and it "tries" to follow it
[5:48:10] <+queaks> Its easy once you understand it
[5:48:11] <%darklordfodder> Factorio eventually replaces belts with robots
[5:48:11] <NitronStreams> you can record a trucks route in real time
[5:48:13] <cyclone722> you have to recorde a path for it to follow
[5:48:14] <%tank7013> You need to build stations and then drive the route yourself to set autopilot
[5:48:23] <%TheWinged7> that sounds cool
[5:48:23] <%AncelDeLambert> when the hell did they add truck automation?
[5:48:26] <%tank7013> For trucks
[5:48:28] <$MetalPanic> Slugs are Batteries
[5:48:33] <cyclone722> it's very reliable once you get it set up though
[5:48:34] <+EmotionalFatGuy> trucks will go through anything when not in sight to prevent getting stuck
[5:48:36] <%Broand> Once the truck gets far enough away it does it automatically without fail too
[5:48:39] <+queaks> It basically places nodes every 5 feet you drive
[5:48:40] <+ReallyBigRocks> It's just kinda jank but once you get it it's not that bad
[5:49:02] <%mae_bun> You want to have your truck lines far away from where you will normally be. The game phases them out so they pop between the waypoints. No need to worry about collisions with anything.
[5:49:11] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Mario?
[5:49:17] <%tank7013> speaking of did you see Woolie and V marking out about the bread today?
[5:49:23] <%Shackle_Rustyford> Shackle_Rustyford subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 12 months! finally got my ATP license this week and randomly stumbled across you streaming my favorite genre of game. tonight, it was a great suprise. i hope you manage to beat the creativity mind goblins with optimization goals
[5:49:30] <Visorak6> Experimental branch
[5:49:30] <%AzureGale> We gon' see this again
[5:49:37] <%Broand> It's gonna change power (in a really weird way)
[5:49:41] <+queaks> @PatStaresAt Its an update to the experimental version so probably not the version your save is on
[5:49:42] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> yay!
[5:49:42] <+OwlLightningMage> Kenshi is cool
[5:49:44] <NitronStreams> PART TWO!?
[5:49:50] <%CapnClassix> MORE SATISFACTORY STREAMS YES
[5:49:57] <CappuccinoGuil> HELL YEAH, DO IT
[5:50:03] <+HitchhikingThrough> Moar satisfactory
[5:50:09] <%mae_bun> I'm so hyped for more Satisfactory from my favorite baby man
[5:50:11] <+OwlLightningMage> Pat will stop playing this game after he sees the Borg cube factory
[5:50:13] <%Nekros4442> Mission failed successfully
[5:50:16] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Goblins might come with alternate recipes.
[5:50:17] <%AzureGale> That's great
[5:50:29] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Excellent!
[5:50:35] <%Arancet> you were chuffing at some of the realizations of possibilities though
[5:50:37] <CappuccinoGuil> It was a coin toss, honestly
[5:50:41] <%VoidBaronJules> nah the mind  goblins were on your side from the looks of things
[5:50:45] <blue8moon> this game makes chill streams
[5:50:46] <+queaks> I really enjoyed this stream
[5:50:48] <%thegreatbambe> thegreatbambe subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 43 months! I've been drinking and have been progging uwu in pf and man it is rough
[5:50:51] <%mae_bun> The rebar gun suuuucks tho
[5:50:52] <NitronStreams> i think this basically puts pat into the same brain mode as rpg minmaxing
[5:51:07] <%AzureGale> When there's a problem, use a gun. And if that don't work, use more gun.
[5:51:16] <%DorianCreed> @PatStaresAt Look up the dude who makes the least efficient factories possible, it'll make you want to puke
[5:51:18] <s1rcuit> @mae_bun it's better than no gun
[5:51:28] <%blastyoboots> @PatStaresAt There were two camps, those who thought your brain would burn out and say there's no fun here, and those who thought that efficiency-maximizing and watching Big Number Go UP would absolutely tickle you; I wasn't sure where you'd fall but I hoped for the latter, that's why I hoped you'd try Factorio for so long
[5:51:29] <Darthkitten_Prime> I hope you play more of this, even if you don't stream it!
[5:51:29] <Tisaric> yeah the building is much more focused than pure creative building
[5:51:36] <%mae_bun> @s1rcuit I just use the sword to deal with problems nikaLul
[5:51:39] <%Shackle_Rustyford> this genre is legitimately fantastic if you're INTO it
[5:51:48] <%Broand> Yeah, you don't know WHY it's cool
[5:52:01] <%mae_bun> Use the Awesome Sink to unlock more pretty things
[5:52:01] <s1rcuit> @mae_bun an actual sword or the xeno basher?
[5:52:02] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> that is a great way to articulate that, I think I get how you feel much better now
[5:52:11] <Visorak6> It doesnt have to be pretty as long as it's efficient
[5:52:21] <Tisaric> you're building everything with an explicit reason in these automation games which definitely helps
[5:52:21] <CrematedCube> The undercurrent of optimization keeps things on a clear track
[5:52:22] <Darthkitten_Prime> It's a learning process. I used to suck balls at building in minecraft as well.
[5:52:23] <mr_slaide> The orb.
[5:52:25] <+queaks> YEYEYE
[5:52:25] <Ner234> aaaaaaaaaa
[5:52:25] <%asgard147> limesPoggers
[5:52:25] <Visorak6> Psychic DAMAGE
[5:52:26] <%Broand> Yeah
[5:52:27] <%darklordfodder> my Minecraft builds are always simple and ugly
[5:52:27] <mr_slaide> Woa.
[5:52:28] <NitronStreams> AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
[5:52:29] <Tisaric> SPAGHETTI
[5:52:30] <Jontman42> it's a monster
[5:52:30] <%mae_bun> @s1rcuit the xeno blaster or whatever. God, the sound it makes when you equip it is sooooo satisfying.
[5:52:30] <%AzureGale> That's just Los Angeles
[5:52:31] <blink289> lol
[5:52:31] <cyclone722> plus there are tons of mods that are probably broken with the engine update
[5:52:32] <%DianaTheAscian> holy shit
[5:52:32] <pokiplayer> O.O
[5:52:32] <%depressed_skeleton> Chaos Reigns!

[5:52:39] <%ssjklyco> That's loony tunes
[5:52:39] <+queaks> Its a 90s screen saver
[5:52:40] <+HitchhikingThrough> I think that's from that guy who did the "Ruining factorio" video
[5:52:41] <KShirahama> let's game it out world
[5:52:42] <mr_slaide> LOL, Los Angeles.
[5:52:44] <%Rumbutt> YEAH!!! DO IT!!!!
[5:52:44] <blink289> someone messed up
[5:52:45] <+ChampionBob> That's just "Let's Game it Out"'s playthrough isn't it?

[5:53:03] <%Shackle_Rustyford> thats a youtuber dude
[5:53:07] <EddieDalmunda> That looked like a political cartoon with no caption.
[5:53:14] <%ssjklyco> This looks like a No Mans Sky mod

[5:55:08] <+queaks> INDUSTRY
[5:55:09] <A0N33> Factory Buses are nice.
[5:55:09] <beepbeepster> Imagine a game where you play as someone who lives in these places that get mined as well
[5:55:10] <%CommanderSqueaks> LOOK AT THAT EFFICIENCY PAT
[5:55:11] <NeonBleu> At that point you've won
[5:55:11] <+CookieCutter007> IT'S SO GOOD
[5:55:12] <%TheBensonator_> Making the means of production their bitch
[5:55:14] <Veluren> That is just a monster megacorp building]
[5:55:14] <%AncelDeLambert> fucking SHOGU

[5:55:19] <%asgard147> HAIL THE FACTORY! limesYay
[5:55:19] <%blastyoboots> Buildings!
[5:55:20] <beepbeepster> *hell
[5:55:21] <penitentpendant> That looks like something that should be in Cyberpunk
[5:55:28] <%CommanderSqueaks> EFFICIENCY GO UP
[5:55:30] <Jontman42> luckily you don't have to build a monolith like that
[5:55:31] <%Shackle_Rustyford> pat, thats your level 80 in all skills sheet
[5:55:31] <%blastyoboots> Shinra Corp
[5:55:31] <+Skelegroove> There was that interior shot earlier that looked ridiculous aswell
[5:55:33] <NitronStreams> ドドドドドドド
[5:55:38] <+traximus_s> don't let it set in
[5:55:39] <mr_slaide> But unlike Cyberpunk, it works properly!
[5:55:41] <ChungusQuest> yeah, guaranteed Corpos built that
[5:55:42] <%Jekado> manifolds
[5:55:44] <+HitchhikingThrough> Some of it may be set up to be visually interesting
[5:55:47] <Visorak6> compartmentalized production
[5:55:47] <Slimeking_Mike> Production Line
[5:55:52] <%Nekros4442> Yeah, eventually building wide is inefficient
[5:55:56] <Ravioli_Ronin> Fuck that’s too much
[5:56:04] <%TheBensonator_> Who needs W I D E when you're T A L L
[5:56:07] <CappuccinoGuil> OVERCLOCKING, BABY
[5:56:09] <%Jekado> yeah overclocking and underclocking is a thing
[5:56:09] <+doug_famous> If you want to feel inadequate, check out the subreddit sometime
[5:56:10] <s1rcuit> unlock the power of SLUG
[5:56:12] <Slimeking_Mike> This looks like a real-ass factory
[5:56:13] <beepbeepster> Amazon Simulator
[5:56:15] <%AzureGale> Look, it's that Titanfall level
[5:56:15] <penitentpendant> GlaDos sweating
[5:56:16] <%Shackle_Rustyford> this looks t r a i l o r
[5:56:18] <%YabbaTroll> gotta follow osha standards
[5:56:19] <+OwlLightningMage> I'm melting
[5:56:19] <+queaks> But its gorgeous
[5:56:21] <Darthkitten_Prime> IT DOES LOOK COOL THO
[5:56:23] <%CommanderSqueaks> THE INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX MAKES THE BRAIN GO BRRRR
[5:56:25] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Spaghetti Chef Factory yeah
[5:56:25] <%Jekado> yeah... a lot of my base looks like that
[5:56:28] <Visorak6> OSHA approved
[5:56:28] <%DorianCreed> It's up to code, though
[5:56:30] <%Shackle_Rustyford> why would you have guard rails
[5:56:33] <+MrJackett> ...Thing is, it's not hard to get to that point
[5:56:33] <snivins> not enough spaguetti rbzP
[5:56:34] <%Shackle_Rustyford> you cant fall
[5:56:35] <blink289> pipes
[5:56:36] <Jontman42> this is the aesthetic choice
[5:56:36] <NitronStreams> WHERES THE PERIL?
[5:56:41] <%asgard147> I looks cool tho
[5:56:41] <ChungusQuest> it looks like Commander Shepard should be running around shooting things in there
[5:56:42] <+OwlLightningMage> Osha is the final boss
[5:56:43] <Zaphire_Saucypants> there is coop so...
[5:56:45] <CrematedCube> This looks similar to my central power plant
[5:56:50] <s1rcuit> @Shackle_Rustyford because fall damage is a thing
[5:56:51] <%Nomad_Scholar> You want inefficient? look up Let's Game it Out for Satisfactory
[5:56:59] <+queaks> Jetpacks help with building
[5:57:00] <%W1nterTitan> Become the scaffie
[5:57:06] <Tisaric> yeah Valheim's building has some really smart design choices that make it fun
[5:57:08] <+D00msDayDan> this game don't give a shit about physics you can build whatever the hell you want with foundations
[5:57:11] <%Broand> Because of how power works, if you make a REALLY BIG FACTORY and underclock all the machines, you can make the same amount of resources at a far cheaper power cost
[5:57:15] <%CommanderSqueaks> What's the name of this video?
[5:57:17] <%depressed_skeleton> byeeee
[5:57:18] <%Monkeyweed21> Now play Total Warhammer and conquer those mindgoblins with real goblins
