[0:03:21] <SovPho> wasteland games are good but you have to invest a lot of time into them
[0:03:27] <Valtorias> pretty good
[0:03:31] <blackbaron98> Wasteland is a pretty good rpg, punishing af tho
[0:03:35] <CheshireP> I heard wasteland 3 was a buggy broken mess or something no?
[0:03:36] <+vanareus> it's like somewhere between classic fallout and modern xcom
[0:03:41] <%RD_nx> psaDogchamp
[0:03:42] <%AnneSQF> psaGib

[0:06:26] <+Jaromero435> Pat do you have a portrait of yourself added to the game to use for your character?
[0:06:29] <%UvBenServed> Probably depends what kinda birb
[0:06:29] <Zeikier> birds are loud and live forever

[0:07:36] <%SwdVengeance> Cyberpog

[0:07:51] <+lethallunacyx> Play Pillars!
[0:07:52] <CuteFlutterSpy> in the portaits folder
[0:07:53] <%mike2hands> Cyber PogChamp
[0:07:53] <Goodvibes99508> its such a damn shame
[0:07:59] <%jessyg920> jessyg920 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months! 
[0:08:03] <%PaladinDupre> @abrupt_abe that wasnt worth 20k CP
[0:08:04] <SovPho> Witcher 3 became playable after about half a year
[0:08:05] <+Jaromero435> just a folder
[0:08:05] <DianaTheAscian> fuck
[0:08:05] <laserbeaming> there's probably a Portraits Folder somwhere?
[0:08:07] <+thegreenbenis> How was cyberpunk?
[0:08:08] <+vwvwvwvwvvvw> why no cyberpunk
[0:08:10] <%jtdobyns> Which game is he playing first?
[0:08:10] <%SoySocks> @thegreenbenis because it's unplayable in its current state like previous CDPR games on release
[0:08:14] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt Will you comback to Cyberpunk once it's patched up?
[0:08:17] <%PaladinDupre> Oh nevermind he lowered it
[0:08:18] <$Afterman_> @PatStaresAt you still should try pathfinder kingmaker, it got patched a fuck ton and is in a good state. its a GODLY CRPG
[0:08:18] <%patriotrenegade> cyberpunked
[0:08:19] <SovPho> Before that, it was a floaty mess that would bug out if you dodged the wrong way.
[0:08:22] <CocoonMoon> Watiting for Cyberpunk Complete Edition is probably the best bet
[0:08:23] <%PaladinDupre> the fool
[0:08:25] <+thegreenbenis> Thanks. @SoySocks
[0:08:25] <CuteFlutterSpy> if i remember right, might have been 2
[0:08:28] <Goodvibes99508> @patstaresat will you return to cyberpunk in the next yearn
[0:08:30] <+Jaromero435> usually User/Documents/MyGames/Wasteland3/CustomPortraits
[0:08:36] <i_need_sciss0rz> cyberpunk'd
[0:08:38] <laserbeaming> It's the same in every one of these games
[0:08:41] <%PanicSwytch> I think a patch for cyberpunk came out today for pc and ps4
[0:08:49] <Zeikier> pat ain't got no yearn atm :V
[0:08:51] <%PaladinDupre> Guess who has over 40k Channel Points
[0:08:54] <segychan> @PatStaresAt Have you played Slay the Spire?
[0:09:07] <Zeikier> check a look
[0:09:10] <SovPho> tbh we're hitting this point in games where we can't just throw hardware at them and get performance boosts
[0:09:10] <segychan> Sweet!
[0:09:15] <highfivesquash> pat do you think you could jump over hideo kojima
[0:09:30] <+Jaromero435> I'm have a pretty good time with it
[0:09:30] <%mike2hands> But you have ove 100k channel points?
[0:09:34] <i_need_sciss0rz> true
[0:09:37] <@SSaryn> Apparently it's totally fine.
[0:09:38] <Zeikier> yo pat I bought 13 Sentinels last night on sale! Super stoked!
[0:09:40] <bob900000> the story is kinda generic
[0:09:41] <pjbuster> where you playing on pc or on console?
[0:09:41] <@SSaryn> And not a 10/10.
[0:09:42] <NickCaesar7> @patstaresat I never decided to return a game through Amazon, when the game was on its way TO me
[0:09:42] <SovPho> why does every rpg have a crafting system
[0:09:44] <+democrazyyy> I'm enjoying it, the loot system isn't great but I'm enjoying the story so far
[0:09:45] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt do u know if monk is good now?
[0:09:50] <%Puhff> It's good
[0:09:51] <segychan> HE'S SO TIRED
[0:09:52] <+abrupt_abe> The game needs a No Man Sky style overhaul for parts
[0:09:53] <laserbeaming> <User>\Documents\My Games\Wasteland3\CustomPortraits
[0:09:57] <SovPho> all I fucking want is a cooking system and maybe a POH system, I don't need to craft my own underwear
[0:09:58] <%AnneSQF> It seemed really boring
[0:09:58] <TourettesPlays> Is it true the game has no driving AI, just predetermined rails cars travel on?
[0:09:59] <%Puhff> I like it
[0:10:01] <i_need_sciss0rz> for some reason the dialogue is awful, what did you think Pat?
[0:10:02] <Goodvibes99508> stares in yearn
[0:10:03] <%Daxalog> He was up all night watching Star trek
[0:10:03] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> people say it's good if you focus on the main quest and ignore the open world
[0:10:04] <+democrazyyy> i would say it's a solidly good game, but nothing special like everybody wanted
[0:10:05] <%PaladinDupre> Jowly dogs have resting sad face

[0:10:32] <+democrazyyy> it didn't need an open world, could've been more like deus ex in that aspect

[0:10:55] <SovPho> games aren't a media where good writing matters as much as good gameplay, so... good writing isn't a good fallback if you can't play the thing
[0:10:56] <@SSaryn> Well, after all the fixes.
[0:10:58] <+jublain22> hm
[0:11:02] <TrollKing96> Imagine if we went back to the days before patches.

[0:13:15] <cintra212> Gods and Monsters was a way cooler title
[0:13:15] <+JonJonRequiem> It's not a great name
[0:13:17] <%solracc25> psaBig psaBig psaBig
[0:13:20] <+D00msDayDan> the worst name for a game since horizon zero dawn
[0:13:28] <%maenos2> that title sounds like a movie by snyder
[0:13:30] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> Bunnyhop the greekaboo liked it a lot
[0:13:31] <%Mr_Pylon> It really sounds like a bad mobile game
[0:13:34] <%BallerSwagBro9k> WASTELAND 3 TIME LETS GOOOOOO
[0:13:35] <laserbeaming> It's a pretty bad name. George the Super Bunny Man seems to like it though
[0:13:36] <%captainpodock> when are you going to start dressing him up?
[0:13:40] <+imspacingout> it's pretty fun but idk how i feel about the writing
[0:13:47] <+JustToWatch> Couldn't do Gods and Monsters for copyright bullshit
[0:14:01] <%jtdobyns> Pat, Have you ever played Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning?
[0:14:07] <%PanicSwytch> Fenix is not worth buying full price
[0:14:14] <%Taisuru> Handful of Dog Face is the parody version of Fistful of Dollars
[0:14:15] <%PaladinDupre> >playing Wasteland with a controller

[0:14:38] <%AncelDeLambert> I mean, I could go watch something on youtube
[0:14:40] <+D00msDayDan> stop him by throwing money at him
[0:14:41] <%AncelDeLambert> that'll stop ya
[0:14:41] <laserbeaming> The game stopped you last time, it seems
[0:14:41] <%scaryboisupreme> goddamn it
[0:14:42] <SovPho> who cares it's basically a p&c adventure game disguised as an arpg
[0:14:47] <SovPho> errr rpg* not arpg
[0:14:50] <%scaryboisupreme> His power CANNOT be containted
[0:14:50] <spongeofmystery> What was that game you got dragged by the devs for playing with a controller?
[0:14:52] <%Mantorok06> Majima is now en route to your house Patrick
[0:14:54] <%scaryboisupreme> GODDAMN IT
[0:14:56] <mr_slaide> Elmo could stop you.

[0:15:04] <Saltmeisterr> Dusk
[0:15:16] <%Agami23> then you dragged them for not making it possible to win on controller
[0:15:23] <%trustycoyote> Really interested in Gloomwood
[0:15:35] <%Taisuru> I'm pretty sure they all died after seeing what woolie did to their game
[0:15:35] <laserbeaming> now do it for Ultrakill with no Aim Assist Kappa
[0:15:49] <%Agami23> i thought it was that you needed to unholster your weapon but theres no button for it.
[0:15:55] <%nofestu2> wo

[0:18:22] <skyentombment> by the looks of the screen a second ago I thought it was cyberpunk
[0:18:25] <SovPho> the standard price for video games should be 40 bucks so i can buy more of them
[0:18:28] <@SSaryn> Badly, with a controller Kappa
[0:18:50] <ShineTheDiamond> Nice
[0:18:51] <Enishi1027> tomatoHoo
[0:18:56] <%Mantorok06> You still are a garden gnome though?
[0:19:00] <%patriotrenegade> In the new Indiana Jones movie, Harrison Ford will be the artifact.
[0:19:10] <%PaladinDupre> dont forget to put points in Toaster Repair
[0:19:10] <+gwanzan> does Wasteland 3 do the weird XP non-sharing between party members that Wasteland 2 did?
[0:19:11] <laserbeaming> this game has co-op right?
[0:19:13] <%Omegaanimus> No game has ever given me as horrifying a faction as this one
[0:19:14] <TourettesPlays> Xbox prompts with Playstation controller :(
[0:19:32] <CuteFlutterSpy> @gwanzan yes it does
[0:19:38] <Enishi1027> put that controller near your crouch tomatoGrease
[0:19:39] <%Omegaanimus> God Wasteland 2's text was miniscule
[0:19:46] <highfivesquash> how big is your tv it is a woolietron
[0:19:46] <%BallerSwagBro9k> This game is good
[0:19:51] <@SSaryn> Yeah Wasteland 2's is fucking god awful at times.
[0:19:52] <skyentombment> @SovPho I agree with this, 40 assures the people involved get paid decently, and you're not paying some shitbag suit to play
[0:19:57] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Any Fallout fan will love it
[0:20:00] <+gwanzan> @CuteFlutterSpy damn, that was annoying as hell in the previous game
[0:20:02] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @SSaryn fact
[0:20:08] <839ricky> Turn friendly fire off
[0:20:16] <%WhereIsWill> psaUp psaUp psaUp
[0:20:23] <%PaladinDupre> Did Wasteland 2 also have the minigun scorpion mascot?
[0:20:40] <%Omegaanimus> This game's soundtrack is an underrated gem
[0:20:43] <$MrPedrovsky> @patstaresat Very loud even on mobile
[0:20:54] <@SSaryn> Hey. No shit, friendly fire in this game is FUCKING NOT OK.
[0:20:58] <@SSaryn> Also good.
[0:20:58] <Valtorias> is he washed?
[0:20:59] <%SharkMissile> Bemoaned by friends and foes alike, the dREADFUL MANTICORE
[0:20:59] <+SilverDevilfish> MANticore
[0:21:00] <ScreamLord> Manticores are rad
[0:21:09] <%WhereIsWill> psaUp psaUp psaUp
[0:21:10] <@SSaryn> Sound is good.
[0:21:12] <$MrPedrovsky> Fine
[0:21:16] <laserbeaming> Manticore is Man first. It would just be a Ticore otherwise
[0:21:17] <%Mr_Pylon> Seems fine
[0:21:18] <%AnneSQF> Good
[0:21:18] <%WhereIsWill> sounds good
[0:21:19] <%nofestu2> fine
[0:21:19] <TCDerps> good
[0:21:19] <%Laecerelius> Sound is good
[0:21:21] <herotony04> No fire was ever friendly in my experience
[0:21:22] <CuteFlutterSpy> fine
[0:21:24] <skyentombment> WHAT IS THIS SARAH CONNOR SHIT
[0:21:27] <CursedNobleman> ive got anchor arms! im not a wimp. im SUPREME JERK
[0:21:29] <boldyfast4> sound is good to me
[0:21:30] <laserbeaming> man I can't write today
[0:21:32] <herotony04> Sound good
[0:21:32] <@SSaryn> Ye. Shit got fucked and for some reason snow is here.
[0:21:48] <%toastybites> Arizona pff imagine if they were in the void square known as Wyoming
[0:21:56] <$MrPedrovsky> @patstaresat Test sound in combat is still loud but manageable, in case you gonna get drown out
[0:22:05] <SovPho> Oooo snow
[0:22:06] <+Pyroclase> yeah drive the entire convoy over the lake in hostile territory, great idea
[0:22:14] <%Omegaanimus> baby skulls are too small to make a functional bowl out of, so they have to be ornamental
[0:22:28] <+gwanzan> snow instead of desert
[0:22:36] <Qsmash_> uglier?!
[0:22:43] <@SSaryn> Kind of yeah.
[0:22:43] <+vanareus> wasteland 2 looks like fallout tactics ngl
[0:22:44] <SovPho> it looks like Metro
[0:22:46] <%Taisuru> I can confirm this looks different from Wasteland 1
[0:22:50] <Mr_Strut> That doesn't seem like a sufficient test for JEEPS
[0:22:57] <+Pyroclase> drive all in a single group, don't spread out the weight
[0:23:00] <%scaryboisupreme> This Polar Express sequel is weird
[0:23:01] <reasonance> its a metaphor for them being on THIN ICE LUL
[0:23:01] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> fun fact: Antartica is technically a desert
[0:23:02] <+D00msDayDan> did you know antarctica is a desert because it gets like no precipitation each year?
[0:23:02] <%SharkMissile> @Omegaanimus That's the kind of pragmatism that helps you survive the apocalypse
[0:23:04] <midwesterndemon> nah baby skulls could be shot glasses
[0:23:08] <%lastnamesilverlastname> g u n
[0:23:15] <%Movemeister> where else should baby skulls be?
[0:23:21] <SovPho> baby doll head mines
[0:23:21] <$MrPedrovsky> Should i buy, Divinity 2, Last Remnant or Resonance of fate??? (Money only for one).
[0:23:21] <%rusefus> well theyre all fucked
[0:23:29] <+gwanzan> I drive over baby skulls all the time
[0:23:31] <%SharkMissile> Baby skulls could be more like a snifter
[0:23:33] <CursedNobleman> its fiiiine
[0:23:37] <eco419> D:
[0:23:37] <herotony04> Drive slower. Make sure you hear the crunch
[0:23:38] <%UvBenServed> The End
[0:23:40] <%Omegaanimus> @Midwesterndemon But would it run out through the eye holes?
[0:23:41] <%PaladinDupre> Go with Original Sin
[0:23:41] <%BallerSwagBro9k> So happy Pat is finally playing this
[0:23:46] <WaitHowDidIGetHere> Arizona Rangers be like: @WHAT IS THIS VERY WEAK, COLD COCAINE THAT’S ALL OVER THE GROUND?!”
[0:23:54] <%Omegaanimus> Maybe a tiny candy dish? A baby skull of M&M's?
[0:23:58] <SovPho> idk they kinda went down easy
[0:24:01] <@SSaryn> @MrPedrovsky Divinity or Last Remnant ez, just depends if you like CRPGs in terms of Divinity.
[0:24:01] <NickCaesar7> @patstaresat fun fact. the largest desert is Antarctica. People think that deserts are determined by heat and not precipitation.
[0:24:02] <%rusefus> maybe they should stop fighting
[0:24:03] <+gwanzan> what a quitter
[0:24:05] <%patriotrenegade> No the Rangers as a collective
[0:24:08] <%BallerSwagBro9k> MAKE PAT AND PAIGE

[0:24:14] <@SSaryn> Make your custom characters and spend 2 hours on it.
[0:24:16] <SovPho> You can't intro a group of badasses with the group of badasses being shat on
[0:24:17] <+Movemeister> "snow" many games

[0:43:38] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @PatStaresAt Shotguns and snipers are op
[0:43:39] <@SSaryn> Shotguns, Submachine Gun/Pistol combo could be good.
[0:43:40] <%Gogogolem> shotguns are great
[0:43:41] <CuteFlutterSpy> or melee
[0:43:45] <huskarl_zap> If you dont do melee tanks you will run out of ammo and be broke.
[0:43:46] <allanmiri> Shotgun is good for multiple targets and close range.

[0:44:05] <huskarl_zap> Strength is health
[0:44:07] <DSD24> Leader characters are good
[0:44:11] <@SSaryn> Coordination and Charisma for up close at least.
[0:44:15] <goose_coward> do a poll for which one to max
[0:44:17] <highfivesquash> Judging by most rpgs you play, ZERO awareness
[0:44:17] <%rumtumtugnutz> High charisma, no awareness, gtg
[0:44:19] <%PaladinDupre> TOASTER REPAIR
[0:44:20] <skyentombment> PUT IT ALL ON LUCK

[0:44:49] <%DakotaMacDoodle> @PatStaresAt Nice Portrait there.
[0:44:51] <allanmiri> That's a one time thing only with int!
[0:44:56] <$MrPedrovsky> @garthunox If you think (judging by imagined tone of voice) that i said it to get some sort of validation. Kinda wrong there bro. Just talking stuff on interwebs chatrooms FrankerZ
[0:44:59] <rei0> it's just once every 2 level, not everytime you level
[0:45:03] <%shadowace2400> must be smort
[0:45:09] <@SSaryn> Like for real though, you're gonna have to look at everything else before you lock in so go with what you think is good.
[0:45:10] <Mr_Strut> Very few points
[0:45:10] <%rumtumtugnutz> 0 points remaining
[0:45:10] <GarbageQueenEllie> Make Paige lucky that she's so strong
[0:45:12] <%CatastropheCorvid> @PatStaresAt Intelligence bonus only counts for character creation, not level ups.
[0:45:13] <+abrupt_abe> You also gain them when leveling so you get lots
[0:45:14] <CuteFlutterSpy> @patstaresat int isnt as good as you think, go for speed and coordination
[0:45:16] <laserbeaming> You probably want Strength if you're gonna go shotty? You'll need health and armor if your want to go frontline
[0:45:18] <TourettesPlays> Skills useless
[0:45:21] <kragavash> points remaining above picutre
[0:45:24] <gorillahandz> all luck
[0:45:25] <+DinnerCalzone> max luck, charisma, minimum int, himbo build

[0:45:35] <+lethallylactic> Speed and Coordination are pretty good
[0:45:36] <popipopomipo> all luck
[0:45:37] <@SSaryn> Coordination, Intelligence and Charisma are gonna be essential if you're gonna be up close.
[0:45:39] <allanmiri> You don't get more skill pionts every level with INT. it's only a one time deal.
[0:45:44] <%captainpodock> he sleep leave him alone

[0:46:21] <@SSaryn> Luck isn't that strong honestly, can be but for Shotguns? Eh.
[0:46:27] <%runyon0219> maybe strike is a skill
[0:46:28] <%Agami23> research is not cheating

[0:47:50] <maskedmook> this is Pat
[0:47:52] <%doc_ock_rokc> no luck chuck
[0:47:52] <DSD24> Pat you don't need to max anything out right now
[0:47:55] <@SSaryn> Max Coordination giving +5 AP is already fucking incredible so yeah.
[0:47:58] <%Alopekis> No Pat

[0:48:23] <%rusefus> woah
[0:48:24] <Javi9563> always try to level up stats in multiples of 2, 2 is always the multiplier
[0:48:25] <%thetrashman_sc> ITS VERY IMPORTANT
[0:48:25] <+Jaromero435> If you have more Int you get more skill points for secondary skills
[0:48:27] <%Laecerelius> Paige should be the lucky one
[0:48:30] <%asgard147> limesEvil okay
[0:48:30] <SovPho> Low speed is not good man

[0:48:43] <%UvBenServed> Do it. Kill them all
[0:48:43] <gorillahandz> it fits for his tiny legs
[0:48:44] <%TinyLittleDancer> The artwork is very fallout-esque
[0:48:50] <+lethallylactic> Speed is really important so you can actually reach the enemies with your shotgun.
[0:49:04] <gorillahandz> it reminds me of ratchet and clank
[0:49:04] <SovPho> @TinyLittleDancer fallout is more wasteland-esque
[0:49:08] <+Jaromero435> You NEED speed
[0:49:08] <@SSaryn> Just a heads up, might wanna make Paige a Sadomasochist Sniper.
[0:49:10] <%thetrashman_sc> its important he gets major tomcat
[0:49:10] <%bread_assassin> @PatStaresAt You REALLY want to put at least one point into either Kiss Ass or Hard Ass for one of your two starting characters/
[0:49:12] <DSD24> Sneaky SHit
[0:49:14] <Javi9563> @SovPho wasteland 3 changed that, the enemy goes and then you go, it's not like wasteland where initiative actually matters

[1:00:50] <tanarath> Paige, you're big in this
[1:00:50] <@SSaryn> @Ashenik1 Essentially, it's a shitshow right now. Don't expect to see it on stream for another year or so or if it drastically changes.
[1:00:53] <%mike2hands> @Ashenik1 because is buggy and anoying , he's gonna wait for 2 years before he play it again
[1:01:00] <%jorniev> PAIGE IS CHARISMA

[1:01:17] <+MajorCrasher> Holy shit Pat's still in character customization? I left for half an hour
[1:01:19] <@SSaryn> @jorniev As much as she is, Charisma is kinda not great on Sniper.

[1:02:01] <Parapattern> Paige needs a BIG SWORD
[1:02:04] <kastev> @SSaryn Buggy?
[1:02:05] <%Laecerelius> Paige is a victim of Pat's unholy min/max lust
[1:02:06] <%thetrashman_sc> ANIMAL WHISPERER ONE
[1:02:10] <+TheBigO75> Skelly the Sex machine

[1:02:14] <%jorniev> @SSaryn OK but hear me out, she winks at other snipers so they snipe for her
[1:02:15] <dots4eyes> Shoot bangs are just punch projectiles Paige
[1:02:16] <%dmdyne99> THE BLINDEST SNIPER
[1:02:20] <kastev> @SSaryn I haven't been watching any Cyberpunk streams so I don't know what's going on
[1:02:21] <%barrakuta371> LUL
[1:02:22] <vonmaultke> Paige could pay with fire though, flamethrowers are pretty good in this
[1:02:26] <@PeachSaliva> HEY
[1:02:28] <GarbageQueenEllie> Can you have an offhand weapon? If so she could get an axe or smthn
[1:02:30] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @PeachSaliva Since Pat is a Shotgun user. He need you to be a sniper to balance the team
[1:02:30] <%thetrashman_sc> VERY IMPORTANT
[1:02:37] <tanarath> animal whisperer
[1:02:42] <Huntercd> Quirk? Paige has superpowers?

[1:02:55] <goose_coward> don't take no shit
[1:02:59] <@PeachSaliva> Animals like me too
[1:03:05] <vonmaultke> Or use Sci-fi weapons like a smrt nerd
[1:03:08] <Javi9563> I found wasteland 3 much easier than wasteland 2, wasteland 2 kicked my ass in ranger so much it wasn't even funny, and I had problems with like 2 fights in wasteland 3
[1:03:09] <kastev> @SSaryn Is that only because of bugs? Or are there other issues?
[1:03:13] <@SSaryn> Animal Whisperer is good for Sniper if you wanna take off Sneaky Shit
[1:03:14] <%thetrashman_sc> gib animal whisperer
[1:03:21] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @GarbageQueenEllie Basically you build you character for 2 specific class

[1:04:59] <%DedlokPM> DedlokPM subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 47 months! More like Pat Stares At Fallout-Com 3
[1:05:02] <vonmaultke> sexmachine is good for aggressive builds like shotguners and SMGs
[1:05:02] <dots4eyes> Big dmage
[1:05:03] <GarbageQueenEllie> Goblin and Skelly sounds like an X Files spinoff
[1:05:08] <%thetrashman_sc> crpg with xcom combat
[1:05:08] <allanmiri> That's what good about shotguns. SPRED
[1:05:24] <gorillahandz> hmm seems neat
[1:05:34] <%thetrashman_sc> its cool
[1:05:38] <@SSaryn> Snipers in this game are ALSO extremely good.
[1:05:51] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @SSaryn Yup
[1:05:53] <%templar010> SKELETON WARRIOR
[1:06:01] <%thetrashman_sc> coincdentally i also went shotgunner and sniper on my run

[1:06:17] <%BallerSwagBro9k> RIP TEAM NOVEMBER
[1:06:18] <+lumporr> @kastev the bugs really *really* take away from the experience. shit like, i'll get seen through two opaque walls by enemies who shouldn't know i'm there, i'll randomly shoot forward into people i'm hiding from, enemies will physics-spin around randomly, or just stop in place, it's constant
[1:06:24] <NeroInfinite> Robot is hostile to all
[1:06:26] <+Jaromero435> EVERYONES DYING
[1:06:30] <YamadaZero> This game looks fun.
[1:06:58] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> damn this is a good first impression
[1:07:00] <@SSaryn> @lumporr I'd argue performance is the bigger issue but yeah, there are some bugs that just make the game have to just restart on times.
[1:07:01] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Yeah, X-Com is neat
[1:07:03] <%Aydarkzero> what was the original gameplay like?
[1:07:04] <Cyphereous> What was it before?
[1:07:04] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @YamadaZero Its fantastic best game Xcom and Fallout game ever made
[1:07:05] <+lumporr> @kastev i had a tanky build that really relied on a n item that heals a bunch of your health back (blood pump). halfway through my playthrough, it just stopped working. i can't get that move to work anymore
[1:07:14] <SovPho> xcom is a bad gambling simulator and i will die on this hill
[1:07:16] <@SSaryn> I believe hot keys are 1, 2, 3, etc;
[1:07:24] <@SSaryn> In said orders for actions.
[1:07:24] <+YabbaTroll> @Aydarkzero kinda like the old fallouts
[1:07:30] <+YabbaTroll> iirc
[1:07:35] <%PaladinDupre> Why does your PUMP shotgun only have 2 rounds?
[1:07:40] <gorillahandz> is that yuri lowenthal
[1:07:42] <%PaladinDupre> might as well have been a double barrel
[1:07:43] <Madovir> that made me want the game
[1:07:45] <%BallerSwagBro9k> RIGHT?
[1:07:45] <DSD24> Well its cause you are a serial killer Pat
[1:07:47] <@SSaryn> Cause shit shotguns man
[1:07:48] <%BallerSwagBro9k> ITS THE BEST
[1:07:49] <Javi9563> wait until you get the jackhammer pat, then shit really goes bananas
[1:07:53] <%EternalJedi> shotguns fire in an actual cone? limesPoggers
[1:07:59] <+TheBigO75> Its cause its a shit shotgun. As intended.

[1:17:18] <+MisterAvry> why would the game give you a win option like that

[1:18:36] <%bread_assassin> Don't worry. Jodie Bell is just a worse sniper than Paige.
[1:18:37] <vonmaultke> Thats a bungle
[1:18:46] <%PinkertonDanPie> Save her???
[1:18:48] <@SSaryn> Maybe you should have quicksaved before ez

[1:19:04] <+toastybites> ALL FOR THAT RED EYES BLACK DRAGON
[1:19:09] <@SSaryn> Remember, you got sneaks
[1:19:32] <Torgue_1> Crouch down?
[1:19:32] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Aim manually
[1:19:33] <+Shacklebox> be sneaky
[1:19:37] <CuteFlutterSpy> croutch
[1:19:39] <Javi9563> they have a detection range, just stay outside of that
[1:19:44] <@SSaryn> Good question actually. You're on controller.
[1:19:46] <%thetrashman_sc> sneaking is kinda fucky in this game
[1:19:49] <allanmiri> I think it just extends the time it takes for an enemy to notice you
[1:19:49] <CocoonMoon> There is no sneaking stance, you just need to avoid their detection range
[1:19:49] <+TheBigO75> Sneaking is detection time.
[1:19:56] <FistTheWizard> HIgh ground
[1:20:15] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Ahoot Barrel
[1:20:20] <%BallerSwagBro9k> SHoot Barrel
[1:20:24] <Javi9563> crouching also makes you harder to detect, and sneaky shit makes the detection meter fill up slower

[1:41:33] <%PaladinDupre> Zeus is why Ducks are rapists
[1:41:43] <Sunstalker> I want the next AC to be in Transylvania, just so they can do Vlad the impaler. I don't care that they already wrote lore for him in past games. Let me be Vlad or a relative.
[1:41:44] <%jorniev> HE IS
[1:42:04] <ScreamLord> Hades was the only greek god that wasn't a total scumbag
[1:42:05] <allanmiri> Hera was a monster herself. I understand getting pissed at your guy for fucking behind your back, but take it out on Zeus, not the ladies.
[1:42:12] <%Aydarkzero> @Sunstalker that sounds kind of cool actually
[1:42:18] <+paladinstarbuster> he got better
[1:42:23] <Persona_EX> wait what

[1:42:30] <Persona_EX> are we switching games
[1:42:40] <%PaladinDupre> yes
[1:42:49] <ChamoCamouflage> @ScreamLord Depends, honestly, with Perseophone thing. On one part, it's consensual kidnapping -- on the other, not so much.
[1:42:55] <DianaTheAscian> the coolest thing in greek mythology is where spiders come from
[1:42:56] <Persona_EX> !uptime

[1:43:39] <ape_hawk> pat, every stream with you is a short stream
[1:43:41] <%PaladinDupre> I think any record label that files a false or spurious DMCA should have all copyrights suspended for 1 year
[1:43:44] <%honeyman18> That's fine, I'm stirring Gumbo

[1:57:29] <+Jaysky> The dialogue is so off with this game. It seems comedic but it's also trying to be serious I think?
[1:57:29] <+atin2000> I apeprciate that he just starts telling the story anyway
[1:57:29] <+krawtch> wow hes actually acting and not just talking in his car commercial voice

[2:02:14] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> if the gameplay is varied enough in this it would be nice
[2:02:15] <%Mr_Pylon> Zeus is like if the biggest asshole at your local bar was a god.

[2:04:43] <%PaladinDupre> AIM AIM AIM
[2:04:44] <pjbuster> fenyx looks kinda lame

[2:04:46] <heartlesshealer> LUL
[2:04:49] <+gaemjurnalist> my brother, the torso
[2:04:51] <pjbuster> he game, not pat
[2:04:51] <allanmiri> Zeus is jellous because he did the gay sex with Achelies, but never got a sword.
[2:04:52] <+Euphbugg> LUL
[2:04:54] <gorillahandz> your face does NOT match your voice
[2:04:55] <LoneFonte> LUL yeah
[2:04:56] <%OrangeMDT> oh no, Patos is a bitch
[2:04:58] <heartlesshealer> it's a BAD detail
[2:05:06] <shielded_minitilt> he is ambidextrous

[2:05:16] <LoneFonte> thats a beeg dash
[2:05:17] <+Promessa_EX> haha i laughed when he flew away

[2:05:28] <+notanofficer> perfect dodge though
[2:05:29] <%EuropanLamprey> flips*
[2:05:30] <+Jaysky> Didn't that happen with Twilight Princess on Wii?
[2:05:30] <ape_hawk> this is some bastion-ass music
[2:05:33] <viewtifulr> Put the game in reverse mode and he'd be left handed
[2:05:34] <pjbuster> why is the camera is far away?
[2:05:34] <mikk_ad> he literally pulls the sword from a stone
[2:05:35] <Blank9> this looks uh
[2:05:37] <Blank9> ambitious
[2:05:37] <gorillahandz> god they get fucking yeeted

[2:05:53] <Persona_EX> oh my god that is laughably trying to be BOTW with an old God of War
[2:05:53] <KingVantq> Uses the AssCreed engine too
[2:05:55] <+storebrandcandy> eat the random mushrooms
[2:05:57] <Valentinius_Anodyne> No, you have to climb a tower because Breath of the Wild :)
[2:06:01] <%The_Protagonist> you know what this writing makes me think of? The Marvel Super Heroes baby show where Spiderman clumsily talks about "looking both way before crossing the street" and "the importance of hygiene"
[2:06:05] <%baka_sugoi> CLIMB LIKE MONKAY
[2:06:06] <Blank9> breath of the mild
[2:06:07] <+flexin_apex> Yup I switch them x for light and y For heavy
[2:06:11] <CursedNobleman> immortals penix rising
[2:06:15] <+Euphbugg> climbing in a ubisoft game?
[2:06:17] <ChamoCamouflage> Reminder that Aphrodite came from Uranus' severed penis
[2:06:18] <%PanicSwytch> Ubisoft love to make gamers climb in games
[2:06:19] <%Zeif00> DreamWorks presents BOTW
[2:06:24] <+Promessa_EX> penix
[2:06:29] <%za7az> I'm with Zeus on this one. Can we skip ahead in the story?
[2:06:32] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> Zeus and Prometheus voices sound identical wow
[2:06:36] <TheTakkster> This looks AA as fuck
[2:06:37] <+Milhvar> So sassy
[2:06:40] <A_Sham> why do new mechanics if you can just re-use the code from older games? OpieOP
[2:06:42] <gorillahandz> is this game gonna be some wack ass "every other sentence is a joke" shit
[2:06:53] <+loukemia83> you CAN just climb the rocks, thats sick
[2:06:53] <+lethallylactic> LUL
[2:06:54] <%MechArch> is this the main character for this game?
[2:06:56] <+Euphbugg> LUL
[2:06:57] <heartlesshealer> ..........
[2:06:57] <%weissguard> oof
[2:06:59] <maskedmook> I dont like the main character talking so far
[2:07:04] <%jorniev> LUL
[2:07:05] <%The_Protagonist> @gorillahandz yes
[2:07:09] <AMaidIndeed> Well... maybe not the Spartans
[2:07:09] <heartlesshealer> fuck this writing
[2:07:10] <%shurtal> epic POEMS on the other hand
[2:07:12] <ChamoCamouflage> I mean, being fair, pretty sure only the athens loved it
[2:07:13] <+Promessa_EX> good grass for one of these
[2:07:16] <gorillahandz> hrrrrrrrrrrrghhhhhhhhhhhhhh
[2:07:16] <+notanofficer> Who knows any greek stories anyway
[2:07:19] <CursedNobleman> the grass on this rock really bothers me for some reason
[2:07:19] <%Spydurman> next bit/game
[2:07:19] <%OrangeMDT> no, they like telling stories. Hate listening to them.
[2:07:23] <%PanicSwytch> Did he do a shoryuken?
[2:07:26] <mastermidget23> Is anyone else getting Lionhead studio vibes from this presentation style?
[2:07:32] <+SwipperSwapper00> holy fuck this looks like a PS2 Hd remaster
[2:07:33] <%Nordguy> did the peasantry have the same love for telling stories?
[2:07:41] <mikk_ad> the greeks actually preferred podcasts
[2:07:43] <%AkronymCLT> Can you believe the ancient greeks ripped off Matt Groening
[2:07:44] <%illusiveSaint> is this game like Zelda botw?
[2:07:48] <%Laecerelius> Patos is very tired
[2:07:55] <+Jaysky> So massive
[2:07:56] <+Promessa_EX> i feel like you could stand on that nose in genshin
[2:07:56] <%shurtal> Incoming message from the Big Giant Head
[2:07:59] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> use blue mushroom
[2:07:59] <%Valdorick> lewd
[2:08:00] <psimon_> @master nah, this is more childisch
[2:08:04] <gorillahandz> it definitely takes inspiration from botw
[2:08:06] <%Ipsenscastle> @mastermidget23 the voices are like less interesting versions of the Black & White minions
[2:08:10] <%Valdorick> you gotta work the shaft
[2:08:10] <%PaladinDupre> LEAP OF FAITH
[2:08:12] <+Promessa_EX> glide time?
[2:08:12] <+notanofficer> is there fall damage though?
[2:08:12] <%Valdorick> of the neck
[2:08:12] <shielded_minitilt> do the assassin man jump do it now
[2:08:17] <pjbuster> can you create a character in this game?
[2:08:22] <gorillahandz> but its not like ubisoft has never made open world games
[2:08:22] <saiyanblitz> Is this a god of war modded
[2:08:22] <ape_hawk> zeus has a point
[2:08:25] <+Jaysky> @promessa_ex And sit on it for a cheevo
[2:08:27] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Typhon did nothing wrong
[2:08:35] <%Nordguy> typhon is biden
[2:08:36] <%shurtal> is that Toufexis?
[2:08:36] <heartlesshealer> but charibdys tho
[2:08:36] <mastermidget23> @Ipsenscastle Yeah! The little angel and demon guys!
[2:08:37] <SlimeSlimeSlime> So, is it good or bad?
[2:08:38] <Persona_EX> this bitch is gonna get wings in like 2 seconds
[2:08:38] <%Oncamimus> its a pat!
[2:08:38] <%NopeBadguy> is it just me or is the narrator adam jensen
[2:08:40] <+notanofficer> he could have seen that from below
[2:08:42] <LoneFonte> @pjbuster very basic but yes
[2:08:45] <+Jaysky> How
[2:08:49] <%Valdorick> Typhon seems like the troll on an internet board who makes good points, but is still an asshole the same as the person he's making points about.
[2:08:49] <pjbuster> ah
[2:08:56] <pjbuster> this looks like shrek
[2:08:58] <gorillahandz> dont make promises you cant keep pratos
[2:09:00] <%DarkVinceX> that character model is uncanny, god
[2:09:01] <%Mrbaconator> they aren't real but glowing red monster soldiers are
[2:09:02] <%NopeBadguy> that's almost certain toufexis
[2:09:07] <+Jaysky> Also I can't 5ake this game at all seriously
[2:09:09] <+Exicuren> m
[2:09:11] <WaitHowDidIGetHere> “Hades 2” lookin’ good
[2:09:13] <%OrangeMDT> leap of faith from hermes' head
[2:09:14] <%za7az> Uh oh
[2:09:16] <%Laecerelius> His sight as so much eagle!
[2:09:16] <heartlesshealer> oof, HOLD R3
[2:09:17] <+Milhvar> Is this supposed to be awkward on purpose?
[2:09:27] <%NopeBadguy> EAGLE VISION
[2:09:32] <+notanofficer> man just giving it to you
[2:09:36] <Saltmeisterr> i wonder what a vault of tartarus is :)
[2:09:40] <+Promessa_EX> more reveals than the vga
[2:09:42] <gorillahandz> oh jesus christ i dont like this
[2:09:50] <+mlow44> Oh no you have to reveal each map marker individually
[2:09:51] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> Tbf Kronos and the titabs were actually worse than Zeus' clown posse
[2:09:51] <gorillahandz> my brain is getting fried just watching
[2:09:55] <%itIsJustMat> itIsJustMat subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months! psaDogchamp
[2:09:58] <+mlow44> That's awful
[2:10:07] <KingVantq> i hate it
[2:10:13] <%Garthunox> Oh they did this in Shadow of Wardor
[2:10:14] <+Promessa_EX> venti
[2:10:24] <%doc_ock_rokc> a small lyre? what are you doing in here pat!
[2:10:25] <heartlesshealer> x-ray vision!
[2:10:26] <gorillahandz> where are the twinks
[2:10:37] <+Jaysky> A bit
[2:10:38] <%doc_ock_rokc> yes
[2:10:39] <gorillahandz> yeah
[2:10:42] <+notanofficer> You can`t see any of them too
[2:10:43] <%Daxalog> Its all up to you
[2:10:44] <+loukemia83> yeah it doesn't feel like you should
[2:10:44] <heartlesshealer> yeah very weird
[2:10:47] <ygtidal> yes
[2:10:49] <gorillahandz> you do be having god eyeballs
[2:10:50] <%jorniev> BUT THIS IS UBISOFT GAME
[2:10:51] <DraxTD> I thikn it seems odd you hav e to do each one individually =P
[2:10:52] <+Jaysky> Takes away the surprise of finding shit in the wild
[2:10:52] <gorillahandz> good*
[2:11:04] <+Shacklebox> This is a great excuse to keep you on the Ubisoft Vantage Point
[2:11:05] <CursedNobleman> i dont really like this mechanic. whats the point? LUL
[2:11:12] <heartlesshealer> Is Fenyx a god of Sight or what?
[2:11:18] <%PanicSwytch> Do U have to do this scouting on other towers again?
[2:11:18] <+Sadira_snack_attack> its either that or an assassins eagle reveals it all automatically
[2:11:20] <WaitHowDidIGetHere> Hey! Phrasing...
[2:11:20] <%Laecerelius> I mean you could always just not do it I guess
[2:11:22] <+mlow44> This is going to be a ridiculously tiny portion of the world map, I bet
[2:11:23] <%OrangeMDT> all of paige's vision went into this character
[2:11:25] <%MechArch> look at all the places you can explore pat
[2:11:28] <Valentinius_Anodyne> That may be a bit much imo
[2:11:28] <mastermidget23> Make sure to destabilize the region so the political leader loses his guards.
[2:11:28] <DraxTD> without a bird?!?!?
[2:11:30] <+flexin_apex> It’s only a small part right now
[2:11:31] <%PaladinDupre> is there a boat?
[2:11:33] <%YakumoYomi> I suppose you could just...not? And then just find stuff as you explore.
[2:11:33] <KingVantq> the power of 20/20 vision
[2:11:35] <%MalekDracarus> This some Odyssey shit right here
[2:11:36] <+Promessa_EX> i guess it's a bonus for anyone that cares to do it buut
[2:11:37] <gorillahandz> ghost of tsushima did a good job at revealing points of interest, more games should follow its lead
[2:11:46] <+MajorCrasher> you could also just not do this and find them manually. the point is to make map markers optional @patstaresat
[2:11:52] <+mlow44> This is going to get super tedious like three synch points in
[2:11:56] <heartlesshealer> Tell Paige this is what she could do if she went to the eye doctor
[2:11:56] <%jorniev> ITS TRYING TO FIX THE THING WITH CLIMING TOWERS EVERY 30 MINUTES
[2:12:00] <+notanofficer> Yeah I can see a vault 1 kilometer away can`t you
[2:12:03] <gorillahandz> dont worry dude, I'll save you! like in 10 minutes gotta... gotta fill this map out...
[2:12:22] <+thackattack00> yeah and now tje objective is telling you to stop
[2:12:23] <+loukemia83> You can't even see that one come on
[2:12:24] <%PanicSwytch> This didn't need to be a feature
[2:12:25] <%Daxalog> You only had to to do it for one. You can leave whenever
[2:12:26] <%blastazoid00> Bless you
[2:12:27] <%coreyyotto> yeah, who is he to deny the wishes of the developers
[2:12:29] <bob900000> bless you
[2:12:30] <gorillahandz> bless
[2:12:32] <+MajorCrasher> it told you to find one thing, not mark everything
[2:12:45] <+darudeampersandstorm> bless you @peachsaliva
[2:12:47] <heartlesshealer> bless you and also please don't let bones fly apart
[2:12:47] <mastermidget23> @gorillahandz That Griffon has definitely eaten that man by njow.
[2:12:47] <Parapattern> You can do this any time you want
[2:12:48] <%owazowski> Blesses Paige
[2:12:48] <%OrangeMDT> the idea of a vault, that's all you can see
[2:12:49] <danielm427> FUN
[2:12:54] <+Shacklebox> Pat, lets be real you're not gonna play this game long enough to get even half of these
[2:12:56] <KingVantq> 20 more
[2:13:00] <gorillahandz> no he's fine dont worry
[2:13:01] <%MechArch> psaGoblin psaWink psaWink psaWink
[2:13:03] <%Garthunox> @MajorCrasher but why wouldnt you find everything?
[2:13:14] <+wholehole> Kinda wish you could toggle it off, but I opted to not reveal eveything and discover on my own, enjoying it more that way.
[2:13:14] <%MechArch> psaGoblin psaGoblin
[2:13:16] <NitronStreams> only 400 more to ho
[2:13:17] <+MajorCrasher> because it's boring?
[2:13:21] <+loukemia83> BIG LYRE
[2:13:29] <ItIsSky> probably to be an option for people who just want to make it and not just find them
[2:13:31] <CursedNobleman> ahh, modern gaming. buy a souped up console and spend 60 bucks to play hot/cold LUL
[2:13:34] <+doc_ock_rokc> Lyre
[2:13:37] <%owazowski> psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin
[2:13:39] <WaitHowDidIGetHere> THE HYPEST GAMEPLAY ON TWITCH!!!
[2:13:50] <+mlow44> I mean if we're just going by "what the game is telling him" it's telling him to "Exit Far Sight"
[2:13:53] <+yukichocomilk> STOP FailFish
[2:13:56] <ItIsSky> yeah
[2:13:57] <+flexin_apex> The goblins are kicking in
[2:14:02] <ItIsSky> I just ignored it
[2:14:02] <%MechArch> i think you missed one
[2:14:03] <+thackattack00> ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper
[2:14:07] <%jorniev> just stop
[2:14:08] <heartlesshealer> it's very goblin
[2:14:08] <Parapattern> You don't have to do all of them at once
[2:14:09] <%owazowski> PAT EXIT FAR SIGHT
[2:14:10] <%OrangeMDT> I dunno, it's kinda rewarding in a way
[2:14:11] <+Rofiarf> yeah seems annoying
[2:14:14] <%blastazoid00> Right? Just make it an UbiTower
[2:14:14] <%doc_ock_rokc> with BoTW you at least had to find it yourself
[2:14:17] <KingVantq> I'd rather just have a tower reveal everything tbh like in AC
[2:14:20] <+Sadira_snack_attack> then stop using it?
[2:14:20] <+Shacklebox> Pat you missed 2
[2:14:22] <%jorniev> stop doing it
[2:14:28] <%honeyman18> This is great,
[2:14:28] <+mlow44> It should just reveal everything within range at once like in the Assassin's Creed series
[2:14:31] <+MajorCrasher> Exit far sight please ffs
[2:14:31] <%Garthunox> @MajorCrasher sounds like a problem with the game designers then
[2:14:32] <%Dutchpotato> It’s weird that u can reveal things through walls
[2:14:38] <+mlow44> Because that's going to get real tedious real fast
[2:14:41] <+Promessa_EX> we ac now
[2:14:42] <%OrangeMDT> ye ye leap of faith
[2:14:43] <%PanicSwytch> Honestly I'd rather u play Age of Calamity than this Pat
[2:14:50] <+loukemia83> D E D
[2:14:50] <%doc_ock_rokc> dead
[2:14:51] <%mike2hands> DED
[2:14:51] <KingVantq> dead
[2:14:51] <+Promessa_EX> this would still end ur life
[2:14:51] <NitronStreams> DOA FLIP
[2:14:51] <huskarl_zap> ded
[2:14:53] <+SinisterBroccoli> and dead
[2:14:54] <pjbuster> literally a leap
[2:14:56] <%MechArch> remember that guy you were supposed to save? i don't
[2:14:56] <%jorniev> OUCH
[2:14:58] <CursedNobleman> super dead LUL
[2:15:02] <heartlesshealer> BELLY FLOP NO DAMAGE
[2:15:08] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> so...when's the glider?
[2:15:12] <ItIsSky> like it's an option but the game doesn't make that obviousl which isn't great
[2:15:20] <mastermidget23> That was a bellyflop worthy of a drunken poseidon.
[2:15:21] <allanmiri> Zeus is jealous because he had the gay sex with Achilles, but never got a sword. Bitch can't take it when someone hits it and quits it with him.
[2:15:32] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt remeber kids if you have to dive from a height feet first
[2:15:36] <+SilverDevilfish> Fucking everything. Now that's more like Zeus
[2:15:41] <gorillahandz> ???? did achilles fuck zeus at any point
[2:15:49] <%RootVeggie> When do you start blaming the gods for everything that goes wrong?
[2:15:50] <+abrupt_abe> It's incredibly annoying
[2:15:50] <stormhawk9891> Same
[2:15:52] <+SinisterBroccoli> me too
[2:15:53] <+notanofficer> is there a way to turn it off?
[2:15:55] <+gaemjurnalist> @allanmiri he got achilles's other sword...
[2:15:55] <thetruenicster> Yep, and this is for the WHOLE GAME
[2:15:57] <+loukemia83> Yeah, both these voices are annoying
[2:15:58] <@commanderclaw> It's very dreamworks
[2:16:00] <KingVantq> Zeus fucked Achilles confirmed
[2:16:01] <%TinyLittleDancer> Heyoo
[2:16:01] <%Nekros4442> why are Zeus and Prometheus cool with eachother?
[2:16:01] <ape_hawk> prometheus is fine
[2:16:03] <%UvBenServed> KappaPride
[2:16:03] <%MechArch> you don't like the greek accent?
[2:16:05] <DSD24> That's not cringe
[2:16:07] <pjbuster> it's very cringe
[2:16:08] <huskarl_zap> best poetry = dick in the mouth tru
[2:16:09] <%honeyman18> damn prometheus
[2:16:09] <ape_hawk> zeus is dumb
[2:16:12] <illtima> You cringe
[2:16:15] <%Dutchpotato> Well it never stops so you’re going to hate this game, just straight up
[2:16:18] <+JustToWatch> Finally Pat admits his racisms against the greeks
[2:16:22] <Blank9> it feels extra bad after hades
[2:16:23] <psimon_> who is this aimed for?
[2:16:28] <fuji_92> i enjoy the zanny commentary, but welp
[2:16:30] <%PanicSwytch> Botb buttons for Parry?
[2:16:33] <Chipshandon12> its made for children talk
[2:16:34] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> It's good cringe imho
[2:16:36] <gorillahandz> self-aware dialogue be like this sucks
[2:16:45] <%evermoore_hex> evermoore_hex subscribed at Tier 1. 
[2:16:50] <%Garthunox> fuck this game
[2:16:53] <heartlesshealer> oh god there's underwater
[2:16:55] <%mike2hands> is annoying
[2:16:59] <+loukemia83> It's also kinda weird that they speak with different accents? Like...they should either both be accented or both english?
[2:17:02] <%honeyman18> Good game for it then
[2:17:02] <%cvp5127> bastion pulled it of
[2:17:03] <+Promessa_EX> at least it's only aware it's a story and not aware it's a game
[2:17:04] <%jorniev> eeeh im partial too it
[2:17:04] <allanmiri> Too wink-wink. Nudge-nudge for you?
[2:17:07] <%owazowski> Drown and turn it off
[2:17:07] <allanmiri> I kinda get it
[2:17:10] <%Picia000123> It has its moments, but it can get really hard to get through
[2:17:15] <devanmuse> i feel like it'd be better if fenyx was a silent protagonist
[2:17:17] <artoflec> i like that its Adam Jensen talking in a funny voice
[2:17:18] <$Memdosu> i think its fine, like fable
[2:17:21] <%Garthunox> this seems like babys first AC
[2:17:22] <viewtifulr> Is it underwater much like MonHun Tri?
[2:17:24] <gorillahandz> like I love me some quips and satirical humor but when it feels like every word is "damn this game sucks" ehhhh feels weird
[2:17:25] <illtima> Pat cannot stand not being the most cringy person in the room
[2:17:27] <%NovaKnightmare> Are they the same people who played Genshin?
[2:17:27] <+MisterAvry> They could back it off a notch or two
[2:17:29] <CursedNobleman> LUL
[2:17:30] <%OrangeMDT> but Pat, do you follow people like you?
[2:17:30] <ape_hawk> i just said i heard it was good
[2:17:30] <DSD24> Maybe they enjoy the gameplay Pat?
[2:17:30] <%PanicSwytch> They have bad taste
[2:17:31] <+SinisterBroccoli> it's way worse than Fable
[2:17:31] <gorillahandz> well give it more time pat
[2:17:32] <+notanofficer> seems like a baby game for babies
[2:17:33] <+gaemjurnalist> i don't mind it, but they're laying it on thickkkkk and it's just too much
[2:17:34] <psimon_> I would enjoy the game. Wont buy it, but I'm sure there's fun to be had in the game.
[2:17:35] <mikk_ad> The art direction makes me feel like its a phone game
[2:17:36] <+Promessa_EX> axe of atlanta
[2:17:36] <%Spydurman> your friends were super wrong
[2:17:37] <thetruenicster> You Should Go To Those People, and Be Like "What The Fuck?"
[2:17:37] <%MechArch> just play hyrule again
[2:17:38] <Persona_EX> they said that specifically to fuck with you @PatStaresAt
[2:17:39] <pjbuster> it looks like a well put together game, just looks annoying to hear
[2:17:42] <+Shacklebox> Why are people on your timeline stupid?
[2:17:43] <+Sadira_snack_attack> plays 7 minutes of tutorial...
[2:17:44] <%Spydurman> this game is soooo cringey
[2:17:44] <%Zeif00> Head writer said the humor was inspired by Robin Hood: Men in Tights, The Princess Bride, and The Naked Gun.
[2:17:45] <%mike2hands> what with the GOW soundtrack
[2:17:47] <Chipshandon12> this feels like a 2004 era cartoon
[2:17:47] <AMaidIndeed> Hell yeah, catgirl axe
[2:17:49] <anAngryHamster> To be fair, gods jabbering about mortal endeavors is very Greek
[2:17:50] <ScreamLord> GRAVITY!?
[2:17:52] <%gksnipa> half of it doesnt seem necessary
[2:17:54] <gorillahandz> oh hey cool guy
[2:17:57] <+SilverDevilfish> This game feels French
[2:17:57] <%Jaller101514> all of this dialoge is terrible
[2:17:58] <Cymen90> I LOVE self-aware dialogue when it is done WELL. Like Hades. Or Stanley Parable. @PatStaresAt
[2:18:01] <TheTakkster> This feels like a game that's making fun of Fable by trying to be even more Fable
[2:18:01] <thetruenicster> Oh Get It, Did You Get It
[2:18:01] <artoflec> not enough adult men in diaper jokes elaSmile
[2:18:05] <%PanicSwytch> This is next gen
[2:18:05] <%honeyman18> I got that reference!
[2:18:09] <heartlesshealer> I know one of my friends liked it purely for puzzles and being able to play as a non-smoothened twink
[2:18:10] <+Promessa_EX> don't go on parler
[2:18:12] <gorillahandz> okay i do like that patos is about to shit his pants at typhon
[2:18:15] <anAngryHamster> Oh I get it, the Odyssey
[2:18:15] <%NovaKnightmare> Is this a remake of a ps2 game
[2:18:16] <+storebrandcandy> funny joke
[2:18:16] <KingVantq> epic
[2:18:18] <Persona_EX> OH FUCK OFF
[2:18:19] <%Aydarkzero> wait what
[2:18:20] <%Spydurman> next game? LUL
[2:18:21] <%Garthunox> can we team up with typhon?
[2:18:23] <Saltmeisterr> HAHA FUNNY
[2:18:24] <%za7az> lol
[2:18:28] <allanmiri> I want Pat to just turn the game off now.
[2:18:28] <heartlesshealer> Eternal Darkness
[2:18:29] <fuji_92> this is funny
[2:18:30] <gorillahandz> okay not a bad bit
[2:18:31] <%MechArch> psaDab psaDab
[2:18:31] <mikk_ad> gimme a breaak
[2:18:35] <+loukemia83> Fake News Expert
[2:18:37] <+crazyspartan214> what
[2:18:39] <$Memdosu> guys its fine, its really not that bad
[2:18:41] <%Dutchpotato> Nice speedrun
[2:18:42] <CursedNobleman> those credits were a good joke
[2:18:43] <%jorniev> cute
[2:18:44] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> i saw a eagle feeder there
[2:18:46] <heartlesshealer> it's fine
[2:18:46] <gorillahandz> POINTS
[2:18:47] <%EuropanLamprey> I thought that was a legit game over for a sec
[2:18:48] <+Euphbugg> I do love fake credits
[2:18:48] <+vicar_anat> HUMOR
[2:18:50] <Persona_EX> okay this is pretty
[2:18:52] <+Promessa_EX> remember DMC
[2:18:52] <+Jaysky> We beat it
[2:18:56] <+MisterAvry> If I was like 13 this would be BRILLIANT
[2:18:58] <deeewooh> wait this is a shrine
[2:18:59] <%PanicSwytch> Was he cast from the highest mountain
[2:19:04] <heartlesshealer> but it better be the same as the real credits look
[2:19:04] <+SilverDevilfish> This game feels like a bad episode of Wakfu
[2:19:04] <%Nordguy> This story goes places
[2:19:05] <%MechArch> okay this area looks a bit more interesting
[2:19:07] <%honeyman18> I would have thought the bunnyhop video would have got yah
[2:19:08] <Saltmeisterr> hey look its just a shrine
[2:19:10] <danielm427> can we go back to wasteland?
[2:19:15] <%owazowski> It's not bad but they didn't deserve that bit after being unfunny and awkward
[2:19:17] <Persona_EX> the graphics remind me of the Spyro Reignited Trilogy
[2:19:20] <%weissguard> Self-aware humor can be really good if it's every now and then, but this seems to be trending toward giving it to you on a consistent enough basis that it gets to be too much.
[2:19:21] <Blank9> it's the genshin impact domains
[2:19:35] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> wait really
[2:19:36] <Cymen90> THis feels like a game that could have been great if not for the writing lol
[2:19:39] <+Promessa_EX> you just are running
[2:19:42] <allanmiri> You mean sprint?
[2:19:43] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> It's a lot like a Saturday cartoon
[2:19:44] <%Daxalog> Give it a momment
[2:19:45] <+SinisterBroccoli> this is straight out of Genshin
[2:19:48] <heartlesshealer> do you UNLOCK run in the skill menu thing???
[2:19:50] <Blank9> you'll probably get a hermes boot
[2:19:50] <%cvp5127> aku?
[2:19:52] <mikk_ad> do you mean sprint
[2:19:54] <artoflec> you'll get it after but it takes a while lol
[2:19:55] <%saadi90> You get it later
[2:19:58] <+flexin_apex> Soon
[2:19:58] <lisadagz> It's quite good looking
[2:19:59] <Valentinius_Anodyne> I'm liking the voice-acting on Typhon
[2:20:02] <%OrangeMDT> didn't really need the "or" part
[2:20:03] <heartlesshealer> because please I need a run if I play this
[2:20:06] <gorillahandz> Typhon's killing it
[2:20:10] <%owazowski> Sprint lwtery
[2:20:16] <AMaidIndeed> Is Prometheus getting his liver pecked out during this narration or is he out of "time out"?
[2:20:23] <%YakumoYomi> Why is he Irish, though?
[2:20:25] <+notanofficer> My challenge is this simple puzzle
[2:20:27] <%TinyLittleDancer> This isn't breaking the fourth wall, it's a different play on the constant narrator style (like Bastion cool guy)
[2:20:27] <+Promessa_EX> typhon gives you cool abilities in prey
[2:20:29] <+Jaysky> The hell was that slap
[2:20:31] <+loukemia83> that little drumroll was a neat animation
[2:20:31] <Saltmeisterr> hey he pat the chest?
[2:20:31] <psimon_> light hearted voice acting... all of the sudden most dramatic voice WHho Are YOu HElLo?!
[2:20:33] <+JackalKing> Why did he slap it like that before opening it?
[2:20:34] <%Oncamimus> this game is a bit bizarre
[2:20:36] <%Valdorick> Reminder that Typhon fucked a snake and their kid was the Hydra
[2:20:38] <artoflec> you're in the "plateau" equivalent where they gotta run you by all the mechanics one by one then real game start
[2:20:39] <MackFighters> did he just drum roll his own chest
[2:20:40] <+SinisterBroccoli> no matter how fast the player moves, a sprint button just feels good to have
[2:20:52] <+Shacklebox> pull the lever
[2:20:54] <ScreamLord> Why?
[2:20:57] <silverira> why did he pet the chest?
[2:21:01] <+Euphbugg> ...
[2:21:04] <%PaladinDupre> did he just drum roll that chest?
[2:21:06] <heartlesshealer> for luck
[2:21:06] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> that jump seems weirdly floaty
[2:21:17] <+Jaysky> This game goes between serious and jokes within seconds constantly and it's making me not like either
[2:21:20] <gorillahandz> now when we talk snake do we mean a lamia or like, straight up a snake
[2:21:20] <+Euphbugg> other switch
[2:21:23] <fuji_92> not this one the other one
[2:21:37] <heartlesshealer> snake or serpent?
[2:21:41] <+flexin_apex> Puzzle are hard
[2:21:54] <psimon_> theeez's you're glider
[2:21:55] <Saltmeisterr> hey looks it ur glider
[2:21:55] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> oh, there's the glider
[2:21:56] <+Jaysky> HMM
[2:21:58] <psimon_> your*
[2:22:08] <gorillahandz> icarus wings?
[2:22:09] <+notanofficer> double jump?
[2:22:11] <%OrangeMDT> oh shit, we kid icarus now
[2:22:12] <heartlesshealer> broken wings
[2:22:14] <Persona_EX> wait why is his jumps so like spiderman ish
[2:22:18] <+Jaysky> Can we perhaps glide now
[2:22:21] <%PaladinDupre> hermes?
[2:22:34] <gorillahandz> nah man made, think its icarus
[2:22:34] <Sunstalker> You'll get a glide
[2:22:35] <heartlesshealer> probably fix them to get glidew
[2:22:36] <anAngryHamster> Daedalus knew his shit
[2:22:39] <Cyphereous> The axe of Atlanta
[2:22:46] <+Gespens> When was Atalanta known for using an Axe?
[2:22:50] <pjbuster> okay that line was pretty good
[2:22:51] <%Blackleafx> nice zeus
[2:22:53] <NitronStreams> LUL
[2:22:53] <afronooch> Atlanta was named after an axe? who knew?
[2:22:55] <%Oncamimus> boy the humor is a bit odd
[2:22:56] <%honeyman18> Did anyone really hunt animals with an AXE?
[2:22:58] <+Jaysky> You need to stop living Zeus
[2:23:06] <gorillahandz> DmC ass axe
[2:23:07] <+vicar_anat> Isn't Atlanta a catgirl?
[2:23:11] <%Valdorick> He turned a lot of people into a lot of things, and fucked at least half of those that he remembers turning.
[2:23:11] <blue8moon> Sometimes it's funny and it works, but other times you just want them to shut up
[2:23:13] <+paladinstarbuster> everybody watch the OSP episode on Typhon
[2:23:25] <gregisonline> wait is this the camera angle for this game
[2:23:25] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> @gespens Achilles didn't have a sword either, I think it's on purpose?
[2:23:28] <+TheBitingIrish> Nier Automata, moron
[2:23:29] <gregisonline> oh
[2:23:32] <anAngryHamster> Zeus turned Atalanta and her lover into lions cause the Greeks thought lions couldn't mate with each other
[2:23:33] <mikk_ad> next item is gonna be the blades of chaos
[2:23:34] <%jorniev> OH GOD dmc eeeeeaaayyyyyy sounds
[2:23:35] <%Laecerelius> Isn't that how it was in Automata?
[2:23:37] <+Promessa_EX> it's missing an execution button
[2:23:47] <+flexin_apex> Like a dark souls
[2:23:48] <%jorniev> hyyyyaeeaaeaeaea
[2:23:49] <NitronStreams> you know if you never stop telling jokes at least a few of them hit every once in a while
[2:23:56] <%Blackleafx> @Gespens she took anceus axe i think
[2:23:59] <+SwipperSwapper00> does this give out Fable vibes to anyone else
[2:24:05] <%DeadManProp> Oh shit, that's Adam Jensen's voice actor xd
[2:24:15] <artoflec> the dialogue is constant, i saw my friend like ..5 - 6 hours, so, its definitely gonna make or break
[2:24:20] <+aslfrasle> O RLY
[2:24:26] <gorillahandz> not a fan of games that look to borderlands for tone
[2:24:27] <gregisonline> a replica?
[2:24:27] <+Jaysky> NO WAY
[2:24:31] <%Daxalog> Ya RLY
[2:24:38] <anAngryHamster> Why does he just assume they're all replicas?
[2:24:38] <+loukemia83> a....replica lightning bolt?
[2:24:41] <Blank9> wait, who's adam jensen's VA in this?
[2:24:47] <+Promessa_EX> why would you assume that would be a good idea
[2:24:52] <silverira> whenever a enemy is sent flying it feels like a physics bug
[2:24:53] <%mike2hands> is this game replica joke is because this whole game is a copy?
[2:24:58] <%PaladinDupre> Real wall hanger
[2:25:01] <+Shacklebox> that's revali's gale
[2:25:04] <%DeadManProp> @Blank9 Prometheus
[2:25:08] <gregisonline> KID ICARUS POGGERS
[2:25:15] <%jorniev> @Blank9 prometeus
[2:25:17] <%Daxalog> I was expecting a shmup mode
[2:25:18] <%DeadManProp> Adam Jensen is Prometheus lol
[2:25:19] <%NovaKnightmare> he never asked for this
[2:25:20] <heartlesshealer> THAT WAS A REAL COLLECTIBLE
[2:25:20] <+Dragon4234> Dragon4234 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! 
[2:25:21] <psimon_> to be fair, its nice to have a botw clone on pc
[2:25:24] <Archmortal> The fact that this is being told to Zeus and he's buying into it makes it so funny
[2:25:26] <%honeyman18> I just want this man to find a real gun, and think it's a toy
[2:25:37] <%Blackleafx> @psimon_ genshin tho
[2:25:37] <gorillahandz> cant get over how your beard doesnt clip thru your clothes
[2:25:38] <%PaladinDupre> Instead of Rivali's Gale its ZEUS'S ERECTION
[2:25:42] <%OrangeMDT> Yo Orpheus was a bitch apparently. Tartarus is easy as hell
[2:25:43] <+aslfrasle> no
[2:25:43] <ShiningAxis> This game feels like a shitpost
[2:25:46] <%Blackleafx> Yes
[2:25:50] <afronooch> no
[2:25:50] <+HIPSTERCORGl> Daedalus
[2:25:52] <+Jaysky> Gotta head back to work. Enjoy (?) the fame chat and Pat
[2:25:53] <+aslfrasle> It's Daedalus
[2:25:54] <%Oncamimus> lol
[2:25:55] <KingVantq> oh you can drown
[2:25:55] <Blank9> between that and cyberpunk, I feel like I should finally play deus ex mankind divided
[2:25:55] <%Mrbaconator> daedalus
[2:26:00] <+Jaysky> *the game
[2:26:03] <+SinisterBroccoli> cuz DAE
[2:26:05] <psimon_> @honeyman18 ye, im not touching that weeb cashgrab
[2:26:09] <@commanderclaw> I mean, it's all anglicized
[2:26:10] <rakkaro> Daedalus
[2:26:14] <+JackalKing> Wait, I didnt pay attention. How did the game spell it?
[2:26:16] <+Promessa_EX> i see stone people i wanna break
[2:26:18] <gorillahandz> hmm
[2:26:22] <artoflec> @Blank9 its great, its shorter in main quest but it has some of the best side content ive played in just about anything
[2:26:24] <heartlesshealer> orpheus got to the end and then couldn't help getting an early glance at his wife and fucked up
[2:26:24] <%Picia000123> Pat looks like that guy from South Park right now LUL
[2:26:25] <%cvp5127> go to bed pat
[2:26:27] <Archmortal> Stink-line sprinting
[2:26:32] <%gksnipa> @Blank9 its honestly a good game
[2:26:33] <anAngryHamster> Latin symbols being used the approximate Greek vowels
[2:26:33] <%jorniev> probably got to upgrade it
[2:26:35] <thetruenicster> You sure we can't go back to Wasteland?
[2:26:36] <+Promessa_EX> you look like ring fit
[2:26:37] <%Daxalog> Wasteland 3 lookin real cute
[2:26:40] <@commanderclaw> "Chosen one, I'm coming!"
[2:26:42] <Saltmeisterr> yeah this just seems like discount botw
[2:26:43] <gorillahandz> oh yeah that guy
[2:26:45] <%Blackleafx> Daidalos is a different way of spelling it, its also the root word for the dudes name
[2:26:45] <%Bellacouste> Bellacouste subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months!

[2:26:55] <heartlesshealer> boar
[2:26:57] <Persona_EX> Thanks for the 2020SpeakUp @bellacouste
[2:26:57] <gorillahandz> play genshin and gamble your account away
[2:27:04] <%Ixiah> wow Generic Hero man, the Game Kappa
[2:27:04] <%Agami23> why does this look like a PS2 game?
[2:27:14] <%Lunaticbro > eat mushrooms?
[2:27:15] <%TIME_PUNCHER> this new genshin hero looks weird
[2:27:16] <+SinisterBroccoli> genshin appeals to me way more than this
[2:27:18] <A_Sham> I don't think I could smoke enough pot to make this one feel really fun and engaging. :D
[2:27:23] <artoflec> if this looks like a PS2 game what does BOTW look like LUL
[2:27:25] <%SirGO0SE> oh he already did wastleland? was hoping that was coming up and i didnt miss it
[2:27:28] <Agami23> like it feels like a remaster of a ps2 game that didnt exist
[2:27:29] <%SirGO0SE> also hi guys
[2:27:36] <ShiningAxis> fuck it just keep walking see if they catch up
[2:27:41] <%Oncamimus> ive smoked...and its just bizarre
[2:27:47] <FicboyOG> sit up straight pat!
[2:27:56] <%owazowski> LUL LUL
[2:27:57] <KingVantq> people saying this looks like a ps2 game need to go look at a ps2 game
[2:27:59] <+Promessa_EX> pat melts
[2:28:00] <+JackalKing> Sonic the Big Hog
[2:28:03] <%PaladinDupre> ROLLER HOG
[2:28:08] <gorillahandz> is it mean to compare this to darksiders
[2:28:10] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @SirGO0SE He's planning to put more into the schedule, Wasteland 3 seems neat
[2:28:20] <%Picia000123> This game is really not that bad, damn fellas LUL
[2:28:21] <+JonJonRequiem> Yeah this looks lame...
[2:28:25] <mastermidget23> I'll be real, I was sorta looking forward to this game, but this looks like kinda ass.
[2:28:26] <%OrangeMDT> seems a little slow and not cool
[2:28:27] <%jorniev> WHAT IS WITH THOSE DMC DANTE NOISES
[2:28:27] <%Oncamimus> Sanic the Chonk Onk
[2:28:27] <+pectusumbra> yeah this is ehhhh.
[2:28:33] <%gksnipa> this feels like kingdoms of amalur in terms of being super generic
[2:28:35] <%Blackleafx> btw did he skip Wasteland? I got here late
[2:28:37] <%honeyman18> But here's a pig
[2:28:39] <%coreyyotto> seems like it would be a good kids game i guess
[2:28:42] <heartlesshealer> calydonian boar???
[2:28:43] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt wanna do a tripple feature and do some yakoozies?
[2:28:44] <%EternalJedi> limesD next game
[2:28:47] <TheTakkster> @PatStaresAt Being honest, it's not a fun watch either.
[2:28:49] <ape_hawk> wanna go back to wasteland 3?
[2:28:50] <%jorniev> HE SOUNDS LIKE DONTE
[2:28:51] <ammobasket> -_-
[2:28:53] <%Daxalog> Can we switch back to the Wastesland 3?
[2:28:53] <Saltmeisterr> im down for something else :)
[2:28:57] <+pectusumbra> I'm sure it's FINE but it's not a grabber
[2:29:00] <%Nordguy> he play more Westland next week
[2:29:00] <artoflec> its how ive felt about zeldo and the games that are gonna be like zeldo elaFeels
[2:29:01] <%viciousgrim> game looks dull
[2:29:01] <silverira> hmmmmm indeed
[2:29:03] <gorillahandz> give it some more time, let it pick up some steam
[2:29:05] <+SwipperSwapper00> its just a generic BOTW take
[2:29:06] <allanmiri> It might be especially taxing after just playing Wasteland 3 which is a really good RPG.
[2:29:07] <punishedVagabond> Godfall next?
[2:29:08] <%PaladinDupre> this doesnt look fun..
[2:29:10] <majindusto> NEXT BIT (GAME)
[2:29:13] <+Shacklebox> wonder how many interns were molested in the making of this game
[2:29:13] <Persona_EX> Pat just switch to New Vegas hit the 2018 button
[2:29:13] <%Ixiah> play Genshin impact instead Kappa
[2:29:16] <psimon_> @coreyyotto with jokes that require deep knowledge about greek historical characters
[2:29:17] <%Agami23> can we go back to the good game?
[2:29:18] <%OrangeMDT> destructible environments
[2:29:20] <%MechArch> baffle us
[2:29:23] <%SirGO0SE> this is ancient greece? then why do the enviornments suck so much ass
[2:29:23] <+PenmanLupine> Mom! I want Breath of the Wild! Mom: We have Beath of the Wild at home. Breath of the Wild at home <-
[2:29:24] <%cvp5127> yep
[2:29:24] <%jorniev> UBISOFT
[2:29:26] <heartlesshealer> cloud forever
[2:29:27] <Persona_EX> HOLY SHIT youre right
[2:29:30] <silverira> I'd rather play Genshin
[2:29:32] <+loukemia83> @patstaresat do you think when Hades came out the developers of this game said "well fuck"
[2:29:34] <+mlow44> Yeah Pat is the only annoying little shithead I want to hear from my screen
[2:29:34] <Sunstalker> Different studios, this was the odyssey team
[2:29:36] <%Jaller101514> Switch over to Hyrule Warriors again?
[2:29:36] <%Picia000123> And then they put out Watch Dogs Legion
[2:29:37] <%PaladinDupre> Like if you really really want more BotW....
[2:29:37] <%Ixiah> wow the head is way too big
[2:29:41] <gorillahandz> different teams i guess
[2:29:41] <Archmortal> But what about that Breath of the Wild money, Pat
[2:29:41] <%M3djedx> M3djedx subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! psaGoblin
[2:29:43] <+SwipperSwapper00> actually quebec put out oddysey
[2:29:43] <%TIME_PUNCHER> it has potential, but it's been squandered
[2:29:43] <%Oncamimus> *shrugs*
[2:29:43] <+sabertoothzombie> game looks fine, you're early on
[2:29:44] <+Promessa_EX> hm
[2:29:44] <bob900000> different teams
[2:29:46] <+JackalKing> AC: Odyssey was better than this.
[2:29:48] <heartlesshealer> play hades
[2:29:49] <%Arkfyre> 100% yes
[2:29:50] <Cyphereous> Willing to bet this was just a small team's passion project.
[2:29:51] <+pectusumbra> I mean they had OVER A YEAR in that case
[2:29:52] <gorillahandz> PROBABLY
[2:29:53] <+JonJonRequiem> LUL
[2:29:53] <Sunstalker> That's what you get with a publisher with so MANY studios under it
[2:29:54] <heartlesshealer> LUL
[2:29:54] <%PaladinDupre> if you're just a desperate thirsty slut for more BotW
[2:29:54] <%TinyLittleDancer> To everybody saying Genshin, it's a shitty game
[2:29:56] <$Memdosu> The games not that bad but when the streamer is not having a good time the chat doesn't have a good time
[2:29:56] <heartlesshealer> yeah
[2:29:57] <%YakumoYomi> And Watch Dogs Legion. Ubisoft put out three open world games in the span of a month and a half
[2:29:57] <%Valdorick> Yeah
[2:29:58] <+D00msDayDan> i don't think supergiant has anything to worry about
[2:29:59] <%owazowski> Switch to Valha
[2:29:59] <@commanderclaw> Seeing people lavish praise on this is kinda weird to me, cause this seems mediocre
[2:30:00] <Persona_EX> Genshin has the Anime at least
[2:30:00] <%MechArch> is this a create a character?
[2:30:00] <ammobasket> Breath of the Wild at home is just Breath of the Wild
[2:30:00] <psimon_> nah, i would rather play this then AC. AC is ALWAYS such a bore to me.
[2:30:02] <ShiningAxis> That came out last year but no one cares about the Epic release
[2:30:05] <danielm427> YES
[2:30:06] <%Arkfyre> just switch over to Hades
[2:30:07] <%coreyyotto> i mean they're very clearly going for BOTW but in greece
[2:30:07] <anAngryHamster> they both have ProZD, right?
[2:30:07] <+JustToWatch> it was a good watch when Max was streaming it, you're clearly not into it though, so just stop
[2:30:08] <scrumbotime> Just play a 32 heat Hades run
[2:30:09] <bob900000> properly different teams
[2:30:10] <+MajorCrasher> it's almost like two different dev teams made the games
[2:30:10] <%Blackleafx> F
