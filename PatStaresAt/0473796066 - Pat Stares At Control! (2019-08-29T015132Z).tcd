[0:16:34] <ShichiNoBushi> Elmo has an extreme memetic effect on observers whether in person or through video live or recorded.

[0:17:09] <%arcaderabbit48> Elmo is actually a Keter class SCP, but nobody believes it because part of his power is dropping the IQ of everyone around him. Sadly, it is already too late for Pat and Paige

[0:42:40] <%RubberFistFight> @arcaderabbit48 well the original Doom had the chaingun, which was a favourite because it was a hitscan weapon (bullets hit immediately, no travel time, in an infinite-height corridor) and it kinda became a staple after that.

[0:45:02] <%RubberFistFight> Paige what about the book House of Leaves? Where they buy a house to renovate it, but it turns out to be a tiny bit bigger on the inside. Oh, and it also has a door to an infinitely-extending and ever-expanding dark labyrinth. With a Minotaur in it. And a spiral staircase that is somehow longer than the Earth's diameter.
[0:45:04] <@lewdskeletor13> @greggygallz Controversial but true
[0:45:06] <simulationbard> Like for loading stuff or for loading the game, or where you making a pun

[0:45:09] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> I thought you weren't streaming tonight? Well, there goes my plan on watching Fellowship of the RIng.
[0:45:15] <%dheng1> this game looks pretty chill
[0:45:17] <Zalthia> I like that Jesse is an older woman. That’s a nice change of pace for a shooter
[0:45:18] <mayorrev> does all she use is a pistol or can you get anything bigger?
[0:45:22] <@lewdskeletor13> @rubberfistfight She mentioned that book yesterday

[0:45:40] <%cureneckbeard> SCP = Shit's Crazy, Pat
[0:45:44] <%RubberFistFight> @lewdskeletor13 fuck, i musta missed that. It's a fucking great book. Weird as shit though.
[0:45:54] <+Punchasaur> Disney bought them
[0:46:02] <%hatesdps> so a cute girl with a ponytail got excalibur. that means this is part of fate right?
[0:46:09] <%Estuko> @Tokanova Paige with her limiters released FeelsBadMan and your name is incredibly close to a Bionicle's name.
[0:46:12] <Ner234> No Paige
[0:46:14] <Tucker0603> 22222
[0:46:14] <+luketrapwalker> Do it right now Paige
[0:46:15] <Fear_Ranjer> Can we get a Paige mod for this game
[0:46:18] <42nfl19> "I eat McDonalds when I feel sad" "But Paige, don't you eat McDonalds everyday?"
[0:46:19] <shevan123> paige confirmed to be a psychic

[0:46:21] <Trash_leviathan> paige with her lupus powers
[0:46:22] <mayorrev> Paige you looking to play this too? :0
[0:46:23] <%Shadicara> Show us paige
[0:46:23] <%RubberFistFight> The author's sister is a musician going by the name of Poe and she made an entire album that was more or less a "soundtrack" to the book also. It's really great, she's a good singer.
[0:46:24] <%NeroInfinite> 2
[0:46:26] <%vaporousTippler> If Paige had a dodge move, it would end in a hospital trip.
[0:46:31] <%cureneckbeard> it's paige because american have gun.

[0:46:35] <televisedrevolting> @hatesdps Fate/SCP: Containment Breach
[0:46:40] <%arcaderabbit48> So far your telekinetic powers seem way more useful than your magic gun
[0:46:41] <Zalthia> Elmo happened
[0:46:42] <@lewdskeletor13> Paige is too OP, the lupus is her limiter
[0:46:48] <%hatesdps> i mean fate does need to be contained
[0:46:51] <%MassConnect> pat: throws tire - me: "you look tired, maybe you should... lay FLAT"
[0:46:52] <%Shadicara> Paige's dodge move is climbing into an ambulance
[0:46:54] <%worldbrand> i want to read that book again one day, but every time i go to try, i find the frame narrative too tedious
[0:46:56] <+Tokanova> lupus IS her limiter 😔
[0:47:00] <+deaddonkey1> classic wow when?
[0:47:04] <wholewheat420> the spoiler is that paige actually DOES have these powers but she's so bad at them she just uses them to knock shit over and fall into things
[0:47:09] <cozysuu> stream overlay suck
[0:47:10] <Run44forrest> paige is so strong she damages herself. its how they balanced her
[0:47:13] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @deaddonkey1 when wow gets good
[0:47:17] <Valdorick> I don't like that, 52% is awful.
[0:47:22] <mayorrev> Paige do you think if your lupus gets sever enough that you'll get superpowers
[0:47:23] <@lewdskeletor13> @wholewheat420 This explains way too much
[0:47:28] <Valdorick> It should be 55% or 50%, but 52% is awful.
[0:47:34] <Fear_Ranjer> @Run44forrest You saying Paige is a blood mage?
[0:47:34] <%hellscreens> hellscreens subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 29 months, currently on a 29 month streak! cool

[0:50:22] <+Punchasaur> Is this PS4 exclusive?
[0:50:27] <trashmanafteru> no
[0:50:28] <@lewdskeletor13> @punchasaur Nope!
[0:50:32] <%TheDullaMAN> So, why was Paige not streaming tnight? Is she broken agai?

[0:50:48] <+Punchasaur> Siiiiiick
[0:50:48] <%Estuko> @InugamiTheHound that's good :) games coming out a mess can be funny, but it's always hope (For the fans) that the game is given some improvement and fixes.
[0:50:49] <%Laecerelius> So it's basically not on PC
[0:50:50] <rytisone> so not on pc
[0:50:51] <%Aeoneth> PS4 version chugfs hard
[0:50:53] <Ion_Laser> PC via epic game store. On Steam next year
[0:50:54] <%kujofire990> sooo what is this game?
[0:50:54] <%RubberFistFight> So it's only on the Xbox and PS4 then Kappa
[0:50:56] <+Punchasaur> Oh
[0:50:59] <ovan20> Epic? i'll pass it then...
[0:50:59] <+Punchasaur> Epic
[0:51:01] <%Estuko> Sir this is a Wendy's
[0:51:02] <+Punchasaur> Nvm
[0:51:03] <twistedj3ster> @AngriestPat would you consider doing a one-off on Ion Fury?
[0:51:05] <%ChaosAethr> Excuse Sir
[0:51:05] <%XzileGaming> "get fucked" appropriate follow up to "epic games store".
[0:51:06] <42nfl19> So @AngriestPat does not need to go back to the cork board to get more of the side quest? Will it pop up automatically for him?
[0:51:07] <@lewdskeletor13> Now that’s epic
[0:51:10] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @kujofire990 Alan Wake with SCP
[0:51:15] <%doc_ock_rokc> Wxcuses me SIR
[0:51:19] <spacecatstreams> i think it's about time i replayed alan wake
[0:51:24] <voodooranger13> interesting
[0:51:25] <%InugamiTheHound> @Estuko yeah too bad EA pulled the plug on the game so no DLC for that game(SP or MP)
[0:51:33] <%RubberFistFight> @spacecatstreams I've never played that, is it good?
[0:51:34] <krymzen5> i will never get bored of weapons or abilities like the gravity gun
[0:51:35] <spiegspikel> You can purchase it on Epic. Good look booting it up, though.
[0:51:40] <+el_of_house_wood> I didn’t know they made a sequel to quantum break ;)
[0:51:41] <tamuprince2> when did pat start this game? did i miss a lot of story?
[0:51:42] <%sleepy_coffee> sleepy_coffee subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 17 months! Hello my favorite friends, I’m making pancakes for dinner and with all this heat outside the wasps have flourished and threaten me daily.
[0:51:47] <ShichiNoBushi> ritualistic impulses?
[0:51:52] <+CrazyRainbows> 120fps is pretty hype tho, game plays GREAT on pc
[0:51:54] <+boxedbit> There were some back at the last fight
[0:51:54] <spacecatstreams> @RubberFistFight i really enjoyed it
[0:51:59] <%NeroInfinite> weird fungust
[0:52:12] <%Laecerelius> It's so cursed!
[0:52:13] <%TDotGoat> DON'T eat it
[0:52:15] <%worldbrand> it's conceptual poison
[0:52:16] <%RubberFistFight> @spacecatstreams I might add it to my stream schedule then. It's a psychological horror game, yeah?
[0:52:18] <%dalmek> @42nfl19 the corkboard missions are DIFFERENT, proper sidequests. The ones at the control points are like bonus "you killed x enemies for random shit"
[0:52:22] <%Laecerelius> The most cursed biogoo!
[0:52:23] <Ner234> OMEGA Poison
[0:52:24] <+Scevda> Didnt peach say she would stream tonight?
[0:52:29] <@lewdskeletor13> @tamuprince2 Last stream. You missed a lot of tutorial stuff. We’re in a house that responds to thoughts and stuff and we’re fighting demon l things called the Hiss
[0:52:31] <%PanicSwytch> time stop
[0:52:31] <%Piemen99> apatBig Poison
[0:52:43] <+Punchasaur> Oh hey there was a guy at one of the local parks threatening violence to people who were playing Pokémon go
[0:52:45] <%arcaderabbit48> He's doing his best!
[0:52:46] <+Scevda> Oh cool shes here at least
[0:52:46] <spacecatstreams> @RubberFistFight yeah, it's not too scary but very trippy
[0:52:47] <%RubberFistFight> @Scevda she also said her stream was cancelled because she feels ill. Give her a break, she was literally in hospital a week ago.
[0:52:51] <+CrazyRainbows> I really don't trust ahti like at all
[0:52:51] <+el_of_house_wood> @sleepy_coffee I live in Texas and the wasps are constantly building nests on my front door. The struggle is real.
[0:52:52] <noobpsyboticus> the IDEA of poison
[0:52:52] <%velemi> I love those area name cards
[0:52:59] <@lewdskeletor13> I’ll never get tired of those title cards
[0:53:06] <+Chronobot> he's an old vampire janitor, he cant move round so good
[0:53:17] <%RubberFistFight> @lewdskeletor13 they really remind me of something but I don't know what.
[0:53:19] <TastySammiches> they're SO huge
[0:53:20] <krymzen5> they are so good
[0:53:25] <omen_setter> the title cards are fucking sick
[0:53:26] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> sheer heart attack has no weaknesses
[0:53:28] <Ion_Laser> Those title cards remind me of Captain America: Civil War
[0:53:30] <42nfl19> is this magic? or sci-fi dimensional bullshit?
[0:53:31] <+CrazyRainbows> he's SO ominous all the time it's just a lot ok
[0:53:37] <+Punchasaur> QUEENS
[0:53:37] <@lewdskeletor13> @rubberfistfight The Preacher show uses them. Pretty sure Civil War did too
[0:53:45] <mayorrev> oh my god is that gun really called the Clairefield
[0:53:53] <mayorrev> thats amazing
[0:54:04] <+Punchasaur> Oh... no more queens :(
[0:54:08] <+YumoNikki> Hello Pat n' Chat! KonCha
[0:54:16] <+Scevda> @rubberfistfight im sure she appreciates your white armor and cape but no need, I also appreciate her getting the rest she wants. Just asking since I just got here working and all.
[0:54:20] <%RubberFistFight> @lewdskeletor13 ugh don't talk to me about that abortion of a show. Jesus. Also it was reminding me of Cabin in the Woods a bit, only those title cards are red.
[0:54:20] <@lewdskeletor13> @yumonikki Howdy! Thanks for stopping by

[1:05:29] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> 50 shades of Hunger Games

[1:05:32] <Jolly_Adventurer> Spoilers!
[1:05:32] <TastySammiches> the hungry sports

[1:06:33] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @televisedrevolting worked out for Twice in My Hero. oh wait
[1:06:34] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat oh man this makes the framerate issues you had in F.E.A.R. look like a picnic by comparison. At least the framerate was consistent in that, albeit locked at 30.
[1:06:34] <Datsanegg> Its Hotline time
[1:06:35] <twistedj3ster> happens to the best of us
[1:06:47] <%topendbuzz> new gun made you forget

[1:06:59] <%cureneckbeard> keyblade
[1:07:00] <Crankthulhu> Keyblade, meet Keygun
[1:07:01] <rytisone> the game needs big red arrows pointing at objectives
[1:07:03] <WoodenTarkus> OOP-001
[1:07:03] <gekizenbu> gunblade
[1:07:04] <%worldbrand> these cuts are so good
[1:07:04] <complicatedclarity> fuckin pound that building with the gun
[1:07:11] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> Bildo?
[1:07:13] <%AncelDeLambert> actually, what system is Pat playing this on?
[1:07:14] <%doc_ock_rokc> Redwoods in a building is fucking awesome
[1:07:14] <%crimsonharvest> (dont forget about fast travel)
[1:07:15] <+valkuma> is that swedish building-voice also in charge of spookey buildo?
[1:07:15] <televisedrevolting> @sphincter_spelunker I don't know about you, but the splintering of my psyche would be a wild improvement for me.
[1:07:17] <%ChaosAethr> WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW
[1:07:18] <%InugamiTheHound> I wish they had a gunblade in this game
[1:07:19] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> I thought the gun was Excaliber
[1:07:19] <+MazDoThing> SpooBuildo
[1:07:20] <@lewdskeletor13> SSaryn has a magic gun too
[1:07:24] <%Mr_Strut> So explore

[1:07:27] <+Punchasaur> Bildo babbins
[1:07:28] <ShichiNoBushi> Now someone needs to make a key-gun-blade.
[1:07:34] <SulfurousAcid> It's a Zach
[1:07:34] <%topendbuzz> you are the stand pat
[1:07:35] <LeftOverPizza13> casually talk to myself out loud
[1:07:36] <transporterthesequel> Your own personal Cthulu
[1:07:36] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> @AngriestPat don't forget to feed the gun
[1:07:42] <SulfurousAcid> she has her own Zach
[1:07:46] <%RubberFistFight> @ThatGuyfromMars this is what you get when devs don't give a shit and expect video card manufacturers to fix their sloppy code by applying driver patches.
[1:07:46] <%doc_ock_rokc> medabots
[1:07:48] <mayorrev> LET ME IIIIIIN
[1:07:50] <%goose_attack_almanac> It is a Metroidvania apparently
[1:07:50] <@lewdskeletor13> I really hope the stand just ends up being us
[1:07:55] <%crimsonharvest> @AngriestPat you dont have to walk, the director can fast travel from the control points
[1:07:57] <%worldbrand> That's pretty good
[1:07:58] <%WackyGear> @AngriestPat go say hi to ati
[1:07:59] <noobpsyboticus> there goes the new director, muttering to her gun
[1:08:01] <%PanicSwytch> I like how we don't hear the voice in her head
[1:08:02] <%doc_ock_rokc> put headshot on that shit
[1:08:03] <flyingavocadosofdoom> @angriestpat you should check the hotline

[1:08:15] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> the dps Kreygasm
[1:08:18] <ShichiNoBushi> It's very powerful. Especially against hissing things.
[1:08:26] <%Laecerelius> and it regens ammo pretty fast
[1:08:26] <NerdSquid> Stand name: Remedy.
[1:08:27] <%Shadicara> That's apatBig nasty dps
[1:08:30] <%QuadraticGravity> SPEEN
[1:08:32] <%InugamiTheHound> its a literal machine pistol from ww1/ww2 days
[1:08:33] <Caidezes> That aim.

[1:09:16] <+valkuma> what is this XCom shit
[1:09:25] <twistedj3ster> I feel like the story takes a hard backseat to the gameplay on this one
[1:09:26] <Ion_Laser> @SilvaChariot0133 Yup. Shit's nuts

[1:09:39] <+CrazyRainbows> I get the best Fringe vibes from this game
[1:09:43] <+tunnelvisionary> the FMV stuff fits very well in this game
[1:09:49] <%Comtrya> Smoking is cool and for cool people
[1:10:00] <%hatesdps> looks like a fucking french AA meeting in here
[1:10:08] <%topendbuzz> they use this same loop too much
[1:10:10] <%Laecerelius> SLOPPEH!
[1:10:12] <+CrazyRainbows> lmao
[1:10:12] <%MassConnect> this short video loop annoys me
[1:10:15] <+tunnelvisionary> also Trench is totally the cigarette dude from x files
[1:10:20] <@lewdskeletor13> *this game does not support smoking or the use of smoking products*
[1:10:20] <%BubbaRands> Gotta adjust my glasses for Maximum COOL
[1:10:27] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> oops
[1:10:30] <+Punchasaur> His dick could be out and we’d have no idea
[1:10:32] <televisedrevolting> Smoking has replaced the giant white beards on wizards. Anyone who smokes knows about stuff.
[1:10:32] <streetmeat1> I’m high
[1:10:35] <%PanicSwytch> I agree, the loop should've been longer

[1:13:53] <%cureneckbeard> Does she just live in this room
[1:14:00] <+el_of_house_wood> Max Payne 4 is weird
[1:14:03] <transporterthesequel> in ORDINARY
[1:14:08] <%rdark_ksu> is it just me or is her head shaped weird?
[1:14:09] <@lewdskeletor13> ORDINARY
[1:14:11] <WoodenTarkus> Ordinary, USA
[1:14:14] <butthurtdave> Hey Pat did you hear that Zinogre's music is on the Iceborne soundtrack?
[1:14:15] <%ChaosAethr> OHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
[1:14:16] <%RubberFistFight> @rdark_ksu it's not just you.
[1:14:19] <%ChaosAethr> UHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
[1:14:22] <+Punchasaur> Uncanny valley
[1:14:22] <%crimsonharvest> she summoned cthulhu?
[1:14:22] <%Piemen99> pssf
[1:14:23] <%rdark_ksu> thank god
[1:14:23] <Wan6Saber> Max Payne sequels were a mistake SeriousSloth
[1:14:30] <ape_hawk> an ALIEN?!
[1:14:31] <transporterthesequel> She's the Yellow Man
[1:14:35] <Thorn14> Dont let it set in
[1:14:37] <%crimsonharvest> (i wonder if any of the uncanny valley in this game is intentional)
[1:14:38] <+MazDoThing> Did they fuckin' cause Alan Wake?
[1:14:39] <FunkyStreams> she has like an underbite and overbite at the same time, its weird
[1:14:40] <Dingo_Eejit> Parasite Steve
[1:14:42] <%HeadsHeldHigh> Thats it. She has to be talking to the being
[1:14:43] <omen_setter> what kind of bean?
[1:14:48] <WoodenTarkus> Zhe
[1:14:51] <%RubberFistFight> Her facial proportions are fucked
[1:14:53] <Rayorin> is it just me or does the geometry of her head seem not quite right?
[1:14:53] <+gerenago> human bean
[1:15:00] <%topendbuzz> are you that bean?
[1:15:04] <patismyhero> Night Monkey
[1:15:06] <%Conyst> a lima bean
[1:15:08] <%RubberFistFight> it's her jaw-cheek ratio that's wrong, I think.
[1:15:13] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> more like a lez bean
[1:15:17] <@lewdskeletor13> Idk she seems fine to me, some people just have long jaws
[1:15:18] <Rayorin> right
[1:15:18] <Tisaric> the head sizes in this game are all a little off
[1:15:23] <+gerenago> she looks MtF
[1:15:26] <$jobbedbone> lez bean seagull
[1:15:29] <Thorn14> Chat FailFish
[1:15:30] <rubbishbinge> the armadillo?
[1:15:35] <therakishsage> She's modeled incredibly close to the actual actress @RubberFistFight
[1:15:37] <+Caffieantedjedi> Vampires got him
[1:15:37] <+Punchasaur> Yeah the heads are too big
[1:15:39] <%RubberFistFight> @lewdskeletor13 it's weird, some shots she looks totally fine, other shots something is just wrong.
[1:15:48] <Tisaric> Except the janitor who looks extremely next gen compared to everyone else
[1:15:53] <omen_setter> are they in the war room from Dr Strangelove
[1:15:56] <+CrazyRainbows> Jesse's fine she's just another Willis kid
[1:15:57] <Fien111> What's Wrong With Your Face: The Game
[1:15:58] <%worldbrand> the zoom shots might use a different focal length
[1:16:00] <FunkyStreams> She kinda reminds me of the fake prop twin that grows on Ash they use in Army of Darkness
[1:16:03] <krymzen5> bit of the uncanny valley
[1:16:03] <WoodenTarkus> Her face looks fine, people expecting everyone to look like anime waifus with sharp chins and no wrinkles
[1:16:17] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> lame
[1:16:18] <transporterthesequel> Polaris LIKES IT
[1:16:18] <Teyaric> And my copy just got done installing! I'm out!
[1:16:21] <twistedj3ster> oh ffs
[1:16:21] <Rayorin> for me it's not the length of the jaw, it seems like her neck is placed too far back, like her cranium is like 2 inches too far forward
[1:16:22] <@lewdskeletor13> This is fucking Beyond Two Souls
[1:16:27] <%RubberFistFight> @therakishsage honestly I think it's just elements of the animation that are a little off, because certain facial expressions she looks totally fine, and then all of a sudden not. Kinda like the animated Grand Moff Tarkin in "Rogue One"
[1:16:28] <+CrazyRainbows> Magnets kid
[1:16:29] <+BHPicasso> Pilates? whatd she say
[1:16:29] <SpaceGuntank> like the camera brand?
[1:16:30] <FunkyStreams> not so much anime waifu but less like a horse
[1:16:34] <@lewdskeletor13> Magnetos kid
[1:16:35] <ape_hawk> notice how pope isnt even asking about the brother being abducted by the place she works at
[1:16:38] <+Punchasaur> @woodentarkus no, the thing they don’t like is it’s uncanny
[1:16:41] <$valriot> ENEMY STAND
[1:16:42] <%hatesdps> @lewdskeletor13 no its beyond two souls that FUCKS
[1:16:45] <butthurtdave> i just got in here, is the game good or is it bad?
[1:16:51] <%MattDemers> These faces in general look really weird in motion
[1:16:54] <krymzen5> its very good
[1:16:54] <+CrazyRainbows> it's pretty good
[1:16:54] <%worldbrand> One was O5--- I mean P6
[1:16:55] <@lewdskeletor13> @butthurtdave Is good
[1:16:57] <TastySammiches> the mouth animations are very uncanny
[1:17:00] <MasterDecoder> The only facial problem isn't with Jesse, it's Pope's Mouth
[1:17:01] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Aiden is Jodie's greatest Aid and Burden
[1:17:17] <%MelBrooksKA> It's good @butthurtdave
[1:17:20] <%InugamiTheHound> Aiden from beyond two souls
[1:17:26] <Wan6Saber> @MasterDecoder damn you, now I cant unsee
[1:17:26] <+CrazyRainbows> Polaris would beat Aiden's dumb ass
[1:17:27] <SpaceGuntank> dylan is the cause of it all, calling it now.
[1:17:30] <Thorn14> So I just got here, does that woman have a Chest Blaster
[1:17:31] <KingVantq> @butthurtdave check out digital foundry's video if you plan to play it on console
[1:17:32] <Thorn14> like Havoc
[1:17:35] <FunkyStreams> It's like they dialed up the instensity of the mocap to 11
[1:17:37] <+Punchasaur> They move like animatronics
[1:17:37] <MasterDecoder> @Wan6Saber Sorry
[1:17:44] <%MelBrooksKA> Dylan, you son of a bitch
[1:17:45] <Wan6Saber> kiaaREE
[1:17:46] <@lewdskeletor13> Dylan is the final boss, I’m calling it
[1:17:50] <%worldbrand> DARKNESS JANITOR

[1:18:03] <MasterDecoder> Ah, good ole Ahti
[1:18:04] <+Punchasaur> An awakening
[1:18:04] <%bakiinthedemon> okay Satan
[1:18:05] <Ner234> monkaS
[1:18:05] <Tisaric> look at how fucking realistic the janitor looks in comparison though
[1:18:06] <+GalacticaPhanto> Why didn't she just give it to you from minute one she's the Director now?
[1:18:06] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> he's the SCP mob monkaS
[1:18:06] <%RubberFistFight> @butthurtdave it's debatable but it seems really derivative to me and lacking in originality. Then again, I've watched/read/played a LOT of the stuff this is drawing from.
[1:18:07] <%crimsonharvest> i'd be more worried about any potential like, materials handling or SCP archive, like the physical place 'dormant' stuff is stored
[1:18:07] <$SweetCheeksTrap> the mouth movements sometimes remind me of L.A. Noir.
[1:18:09] <%BubbaRands> Dylan, Dylan, Dylan, Dylan, and Dylan.Because he spit hot fyre
[1:18:12] <Tucker0603> SATAN

[1:18:23] <noobpsyboticus> oh shit
[1:18:27] <+Caffieantedjedi> Vampires gonna get you
[1:18:28] <@lewdskeletor13> He’s an evil vampire
[1:18:32] <%miguelrod777> DEFINITELY NOT EVIL
[1:18:33] <CherrieVelvet> he just wants help with the cleaning
[1:18:35] <Dingo_Eejit> Don't make me say it, I'm a cleaner
[1:18:36] <ALazo> Never get on the janitor's bad side. Same with the person that cooks your food

[1:18:47] <Thorn14> Timed Missions D:
[1:18:48] <%Scottigecko> made him clean your poop coated private bathroom one too many times
[1:18:49] <Rayorin> @Thorn14 the chest blaster like Aoyama from MHA
[1:18:51] <%Forente> timed dailies
[1:18:51] <%Shadicara> go do it
[1:18:52] <@lewdskeletor13> NotLikeThis
[1:18:53] <SulfurousAcid> do the thing!
[1:18:55] <krymzen5> wait there are timed missions?
[1:18:59] <@lewdskeletor13> Timed missions fuck me up
[1:19:01] <WoodenTarkus> @AngriestPat There are random missions that appear that give bette rewards, they are timed but optional.
[1:19:04] <%SoFarFetched> same
[1:19:07] <+RealPT1> i didn't know this was dead rising
[1:19:07] <%RubberFistFight> this gives me the same feeling that shitty danish show "The Rain" did.
[1:19:08] <%Shadicara> Timed missions is this dead rising?
[1:19:11] <%SoFarFetched> I like looking around and stufff
[1:19:12] <+CrazyRainbows> Dylan did all this just to fight Dracula

[1:19:30] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> what a helpful board
[1:19:32] <%Laecerelius> Thanks for the obvious, Board
[1:19:36] <complicatedclarity> shut up come one get down with the hissness
[1:19:42] <%Goldenwolf98> Timed missions are super annoying if your game is not designed around them like the first 2 dead risings and even then
[1:19:50] <%SoFarFetched> I like how they just fall like that after being pulled off LUL
[1:19:53] <%MakotoPB> puppet video?
[1:19:54] <FunkyStreams> what a mysterious jogo
[1:19:56] <%RubberFistFight> liberal application of tropes with no real understanding of their fundamentals.

[1:20:57] <$renegadehatter> @AngriestPat Night Springs is the show from Alan Wake
[1:20:58] <therakishsage> Night Springs sounds...ODDLY familiar.
[1:20:59] <MichaelDood> sbfpYeyeye
[1:21:08] <notToph> look for the other puppet video Pat D:
[1:21:09] <krymzen5> this looks A lot less restrictive tho. esp since they are optional
[1:21:10] <%Estuko> apatWhat
[1:21:18] <TeaJayGee> wasnt night springs from alan wake?
[1:21:23] <Thorn14> Oh shit

[1:21:39] <+CrazyRainbows> the puppets are so good
[1:21:39] <%Goldenwolf98> @krymzen5 honestly the games are pretty well designed around them and in Dead Rising 3 the time means almost nothing and its not dead rising 4 so its fun to play LUL

[1:24:01] <%Aeoneth> There's more of them, they pop up randomly
[1:24:02] <%RubberFistFight> Apparently this game is in the same universe as Alan Wake. Figure that one out.
[1:24:04] <FunkyStreams> Seems like this game went to great lengths to not appear like what it is... a third person shooter
[1:24:06] <%Ne1son> Elmo soothes a broken soul
[1:24:07] <noobpsyboticus> restart the game now
[1:24:07] <%PanicSwytch> Snake, snake? Snaaaaaaake

[1:24:11] <$jobbedbone> save file ruined?
[1:24:12] <Wan6Saber> even O'Connor can take a punch better than that Kappa
[1:24:24] <Thorn14> This game would be 100% better if those floating people were T Posing
[1:24:34] <Rayorin> What's the consequence of failing a mission?
[1:24:37] <Wan6Saber> !vanish
[1:24:39] <SulfurousAcid> are those boxes just upgrade mats?
[1:24:45] <FlyguyJP> Jogging through literal Hell
[1:24:45] <%RubberFistFight> @Thorn14 it could still happen, we had multiple a-posing maintenance staff yesterday.
[1:24:46] <%floralkami> @angriestpat they come back, don't worry. They are actually quite frequent
[1:24:47] <Wan6Saber> shit

[1:24:58] <FunkyStreams> turn em into fart gas, chief
[1:25:15] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> I'm getting uncharted flashbacks with this hipfire

[1:25:22] <Thorn14> needs more punch lasers
[1:25:24] <krymzen5> that thing just shreds them
[1:25:28] <%PanicSwytch> One Puuuuuuunch
[1:25:43] <FunkyStreams> that gaseous affect is cool but over used.
[1:25:44] <%hatesdps> could someone explain to me what punch lasers are
[1:25:57] <%cureneckbeard> ████
[1:26:04] <krymzen5> @hatesdps lazers u punch with
[1:26:05] <Rayorin> Those guys popping remind me of SimIED's. Colored baby powder everywhere
[1:26:10] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Yikes. Topical
[1:26:15] <SixthSun2> oh real life thing?
[1:26:17] <Thorn14> Basically in Naughty Dog games, when you press punch, the game programming sends out a laser to see if it hits an enemy
[1:26:17] <FlyguyJP> Cuba was aliens. Knew it.
[1:26:19] <%YumoNikki> @hatesdps Lasers with boxing gloves
[1:26:21] <%worldbrand> PAIGE
[1:26:23] <%topendbuzz> ?
[1:26:25] <FunkyStreams> has to do with how combat finishers are conditioned in Naughty Dog games
[1:26:26] <Ion_Laser> This legit happened at the embassy
[1:26:30] <%Piemen99> A boot?
[1:26:33] <Thorn14> What Funky said
[1:26:36] <transporterthesequel> Burn it
[1:26:38] <complicatedclarity> vibrating hooker boots
[1:26:39] <%Agami23> oh god, paiges ugly boots have been altered!
[1:26:39] <ape_hawk> those spurs, they jingle jangle jingle?
[1:26:40] <transporterthesequel> Burn the mold
[1:26:41] <%MagickBurritoh> Yeyeye

[1:27:32] <%Laecerelius> Pat is the true muppet
[1:27:34] <Ner234> Chat ALWAYS lies.
[1:27:35] <Trash_leviathan> you are the puppet fool
[1:27:35] <SulfurousAcid> PAT IS THE PUPPET
[1:27:36] <notToph> It should be in the area after the Cafeteria, there's a control point near it Pat
[1:27:38] <rytisone> look in the mirror
[1:27:39] <+HotBloodedHero> 3? Seems like 3
[1:27:41] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> The puppet was the friends we made on the way.
[1:27:41] <%SoFarFetched> Muppets or Puppets who would win in a fight
[1:27:43] <%Goldenwolf98> YOU ARE THE PUPPET apatGoblin
[1:27:52] <+Oktulp21 > So is this game just SCP?
[1:27:55] <Fien111> No PUppets, only Muppets. Everywhere
[1:27:56] <Rayorin> Muppets @SoFarFetched
[1:28:00] <flyingavocadosofdoom> It's like 20ft from a control point
[1:28:02] <%doc_ock_rokc> Maybe the real puppets were the friends we made along the way
[1:28:04] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Follow the butterflies, wheeeee
[1:28:05] <%SoFarFetched> an excellent choice SeemsGood
[1:28:06] <Ggamre> not only did I learn about this game thru Pat I learned about him streaming it thru the comic on twitter
[1:28:09] <%cureneckbeard> the puppets are in ██████ at the ████████
[1:28:10] <Ggamre> cause I mean

[1:28:15] <Ggamre> let's be honest
[1:28:15] <%walternatorz> tv puppet pals, tv puppet pals, lots of fun for boys and gals
[1:28:17] <%starotter70> @SoFarFetched Muppets have the size advantage
[1:28:22] <MichaelDood> Muppets are on Paige's stream.
[1:28:24] <Ggamre> the basketball video really is the best scp
[1:28:27] <tacoisgoods> chat says near the control point so...
[1:28:30] <%SoFarFetched> @Sphincter_Spelunker "It was the butterfly I tell you! The Butterfly! NotLikeThis "
[1:29:05] <noobpsyboticus> I kinda like the pistol better
[1:29:08] <FlyguyJP> Force powers make life so much easier to murder
[1:29:08] <%Goldenwolf98> when is the big weird sexy flesh blob gonna show up?
[1:29:14] <krymzen5> these physics are very satisfying

[1:44:50] <rytisone> 3rd bathroom for the rest of gender identities
[1:44:52] <%Goldenwolf98> I feel like an evil toilet is an actual SCP
[1:44:53] <%waltzqueen> gender neutral bathroom?

[2:07:14] <SleepyMaribo> bad ending locked in
[2:07:16] <+Ryuutennou> trying to find where the enemies are in this game seems rough sometimes
[2:07:19] <Hydrapissed> pat always just Short on time when it comes to saving people
[2:07:20] <WoodenTarkus> Their sacrifices were 100% in vain
[2:07:25] <rytisone> You got: Stone Award
[2:07:28] <%floralkami> I just noticed that the health bar also disintegrates into smoke
[2:07:33] <%velemi> @InugamiTheHound honestly the only reason he's popular is because he started back in like the VCL days
[2:07:34] <SulfurousAcid> oh, it's a schlooter?
[2:07:36] <FlyguyJP> Pat is the hero they needed... but not the one they deserved
[2:07:41] <Thorn14> Pat you monster
[2:07:43] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> "Pat is always just short" You can stop there @Hydrapissed
[2:07:44] <%luftraumm1> the shadow remains cast
[2:07:45] <%TranquilTurnip> All sacrifices are in vain when you think about it existencially
[2:07:52] <cascadepersona> *Can't stop Sephiroth and Meteor impacts on planet* "Well, at least I tr-"

[2:08:23] <%starotter70> @haveswordmuststing eh, not too bad in my experience
[2:08:45] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> oh no, he's ignoring a game mechanic like Woolie
[2:08:47] <%YumoNikki> @haveswordmuststing Not that bad, I'd say
[2:08:50] <+HotBloodedHero> uhoh
[2:08:55] <cascadepersona> @flyguyjp "DON'T WANNA FALL ASLEEP"

[2:09:18] <NaderShahDidNothingWrong> Not exactly
[2:09:19] <SulfurousAcid> TheIlluminati
[2:09:29] <rubbishbinge> panopticon is a vita game that died too young
[2:09:29] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> The declaration of independence is there
[2:09:30] <%dekkitout> Penopticon sounds like a subsect of Decepticons

[2:09:40] <NaderShahDidNothingWrong> It was a design for a prison
[2:09:41] <wholewheat420> @FunkyStreams the fractalling is basically her stand, she's got a little entity in her brain and thats its symbol
[2:09:42] <%starotter70> He fixes his glasses like an anime character
[2:09:43] <%luftraumm1> also those towers in the middle of prisons

[2:09:53] <FlyguyJP> Altered Items AKA Off-Brand SCPs
[2:09:56] <rytisone> This game promotes smoking and use of cigarettes
[2:10:13] <FunkyStreams> you guys see that? we almost saw his face there. So illusive. An Illusive Man.
[2:10:20] <%RubberFistFight> @FlyguyJP it baffles me how this game got reviewed as highly as it has
[2:10:21] <NaderShahDidNothingWrong> A prison where the prisoners could be seen at all times, and knowing they were watched would change the prisoner's behavior
[2:10:26] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @darudeampersandstorm I didn't play much of Max Payne, so I don't get the association. Just fine to me
[2:10:27] <haveswordmuststing> @flyguyjp or those artifacts in stalker
[2:10:32] <FunkyStreams> @wholewheat420 I see.
[2:10:35] <%Dementedpenguin> Imagine seeing this shit in your head everyday

[2:13:14] <+Tokanova> neat
[2:13:15] <%Laecerelius> Multishot mod!
[2:13:18] <@lewdskeletor13> Weaker was fucking teleporting I don’t care what you nerds think
[2:13:20] <+Tokanova> time to test it
[2:13:29] <@lewdskeletor13> Wesker
[2:13:29] <+Tokanova> naah
[2:13:29] <%Anonymasque> It's supposed to be sunset? but that's now how sunset works at all if that's the case
[2:13:30] <%Laecerelius> gotta grind offscreen
[2:13:31] <AurysTest> Wesker is 100% teleporting
[2:13:32] <%NWR_James> Tough4Pats
[2:13:35] <%RubberFistFight> @lewdskeletor13 wait, there's an argument that he wasn't teleporting?
[2:13:36] <FlyguyJP> 3 guys are too tough LUL
[2:13:36] <Hydrapissed> wesker was teleporting for sure
[2:13:37] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> I personally like Time to make History from Golden over vanilla

[2:13:48] <WoodenTarkus> Time does not/cannot work in the Oldest House
[2:13:56] <%InugamiTheHound> RTX=roosterteeth con?
[2:13:58] <FlyguyJP> Pat the Coward runs from literally no danger
[2:14:02] <Ner234> Wesker doesn't teleport.
[2:14:02] <gustavozxd> the good version of p4 battle theme plays once in the entire game
[2:14:09] <waifoong98> @Goobbue yes, that's why most people forgot lol
[2:14:14] <%starotter70> @lewdskeletor13 I think the idea of Weaker running very fast makes him seem Stronger
[2:14:19] <%sl8r4l8r> Wesker option selects into teleporting
[2:14:20] <AurysTest> Nah
[2:14:20] <+Tokanova> is the Board an OOP?
[2:14:24] <Hydrapissed> Vio WATES
[2:14:26] <cascadepersona> Time to Make History doesn't grate on me as much as Reach out to the Truth
[2:14:29] <AurysTest> Magic teleporting is better than strong running
[2:14:34] <@lewdskeletor13> @rubberfistfight It was a big argument while that LP was going on
[2:14:39] <%RubberFistFight> @Anonymasque No shut up, the sun is totally perfectly positioned over a window facing directly upwards during sunset, it's fine. It's not a design fuckup, it's A FEATURE Kappa

[2:15:43] <%Shadicara> no shields
[2:15:48] <%RubberFistFight> @lewdskeletor13 well like... if he's in one position, and then with the barest fractional passing of time, he's in another position without moving through the intervening space, that's TELEPORTING. How can anyone see it differently? That's what baffles me.
[2:15:51] <%Anonymasque> @RubberFistFight Who am I anyway? Just some guy who's never seen the sun probably.
[2:15:53] <FlyguyJP> Puny gun pales in comparison to launching a CO2 canister at their face

[2:27:39] <FunkyStreams> ahhhh
[2:27:40] <FalseEyeD> WW1 leaf blower
[2:27:43] <simulationbard> It was clever right up in till he took both hands off the control to light a blunt
[2:27:45] <%Laecerelius> explains why they're sucking and dying so much
[2:27:49] <CheckMyDubsSkrub> Maybe with there being no actual physical interactions going on and that it's all a "poster" or "facade" like the protagonist mentioned in the begining.
[2:27:55] <%d00msdaydan> isn't that a ww2 machine gun?
[2:28:00] <tamuprince2> what about the gun you have then?
[2:28:01] <Rayorin> WW2
[2:28:04] <Ion_Laser> @d00msdaydan WWI
[2:28:06] <Rayorin> ww1 mean

[2:28:14] <%Laecerelius> UGH
[2:28:15] <FunkyStreams> doesn't reeeally make sense though seeing as there isn't that much of a difference between something like that and say an mp5
[2:28:15] <chronoxgp> looks like a gun that goes on a bipod
[2:28:16] <Ner234> OH NOOOO

[2:28:21] <@lewdskeletor13> BOOKER CATCH

[2:28:31] <%d00msdaydan> unless it's a health bar you don't get to see
[2:28:33] <%miguelrod777> diea in a single hit
[2:28:33] <Rayorin> Canadians in WW1 used it too
[2:28:34] <CheckMyDubsSkrub> With the ban on culturally recognizable objects being an implementation of limiting of variables from a hypothetical standpoint
[2:28:39] <FlyguyJP> Big Doors for Big Boys
[2:28:41] <Hydrapissed> both of them are 5'4

[2:30:28] <CheckMyDubsSkrub> They're standing there to be a "detail" for the character to notice. Actors just filling a role, if you will. My theory.
[2:30:29] <DraxTD> Pat stares at old B film
[2:30:31] <derekwst3> its almost 9:30 and its 91 degress, its going to be a chilly night for once
[2:30:31] <Hydrapissed> its main DOc
[2:30:38] <Rayorin> The Canadian Expeditionary Force in WW1 were some of the first to effectively use the Lewis gun in combat and distinguished themselves in the actions they took in the Great War.

[2:40:33] <%Shadicara> It's a torch though
[2:40:35] <%doc_ock_rokc> Flashlights are used by Guardsmen!
[2:40:37] <Valdorick> In counties that call them Torches, what do they call their fleshlights?
[2:40:37] <%InugamiTheHound> flashlights or fleshlights?
[2:40:38] <FlyguyJP> America has domain over on this continent. They are Flashlights dammit
[2:40:48] <Kalinflip> torch huh cmonBruh
[2:40:49] <CrowbarFacelift> Didn't expect a main Yakuzie game to feature Kasuga, thought it'd be a spinoff title
[2:40:50] <%RubberFistFight> they're called both torches AND flashlights here in Australia.
[2:40:56] <%worldbrand> they're photon cannons
[2:40:58] <%howlesmovingcock> there called led lights.
[2:40:58] <FunkyStreams> Yeah I thought Cananda was in agreeance with the rest of the world that we are no longer living in Medeval times
[2:41:01] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> one of ichiban's main character traits is that he loves dragon quest
[2:41:03] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> "I wanted donuts"
[2:41:06] <Run44forrest> cornerstore eggs?
[2:41:07] <+el_of_house_wood> You burn torches haven’t you watched Indiana Jones.
[2:41:09] <waifoong98> Whoops
[2:41:14] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> ichiban is a gamer
[2:41:18] <derekwst3> @AngriestPat i think its TIME to fix the CLOCK situation
[2:41:20] <Run44forrest> TMNT?
[2:41:22] <%AllyBeeBoo> because you know they should be called torches
[2:41:24] <cascadepersona> @hunk_of_dunk Apparently, they had to get approval from Square Enix to say that LUL
[2:41:25] <rytisone> You dont bbring pitchforks and flashlights to a riot
[2:41:42] <%Piemen99> poor guy
[2:41:47] <FlyguyJP> So... his fridge killed his son
[2:41:54] <%RubberFistFight> @FunkyStreams [looks at the countries still using the Imperial system of measurement] Huh.
[2:41:55] <Run44forrest> GHOST FRIDGE
[2:41:56] <crazy_laughter> Evil fridge eats children
[2:41:56] <laguerrilha> at least he moved on. good for him
[2:42:08] <%sleepy_coffee> His son is the fridge now
[2:42:08] <Ner234> FUCK Fridges
[2:42:14] <FlyguyJP> Vending Machines are death machines
[2:42:19] <rytisone> Damn you A FRIDGE
[2:42:20] <%beetbo2> Devil fridge
[2:42:20] <PortableBoredom> Is the refrigerator the origami killer
[2:42:23] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> i hope there's a sidestory in Y7 where ichiban has to rise up
[2:42:25] <%InugamiTheHound> is that same fridge that Indy used to save himself from a nuke?
[2:42:32] <%howlesmovingcock> You arnt out of time LMAO
[2:42:32] <FunkyStreams> @RubberFistFight good point
[2:42:33] <%Laecerelius> They're in an office with potentially infinite space, so eh
[2:42:37] <+Punchasaur> Mario64 piano is the scariest scp
[2:42:37] <Valentinius_Anodyne> I like it, feels weird and great
[2:42:39] <%cureneckbeard> You can clear the clocks when you come back with Super Bomb
[2:42:40] <artoflec> Wait is Y7 actually fucking turn based, i know they made that joke Video.
[2:42:40] <SirBrawler18> Clock Blockers
[2:42:40] <%Anonymasque> I bet it was one of them Samsung smart fridges...newfangled bullshit
[2:42:45] <waifoong98> they really clocked up this place huh Kappa
[2:42:48] <%beetbo2> SHIN fridge
[2:42:50] <Rayorin> Flashlights are called that because originally they could only be used briefly for momentary "flashes" of light
[2:42:53] <Run44forrest> people who get killed by vending machines "probably" deserved it
[2:43:06] <SulfurousAcid> bonfire lit
[2:43:07] <noobpsyboticus> brave and STUPID
[2:43:11] <%RubberFistFight> @InugamiTheHound you know, I dispute that moment as being "ridiculous" since he did an equivalent thing in Temple of Doom - rode an inflatable raft from a plane down a mountain into a river, with no injuries.
[2:43:11] <laguerrilha> fridges attack you at your most vulnerable moment: getting snacks late at night when you are not really hungry
[2:43:17] <waifoong98> @Run44forrest reminds me of nightcry LUL
[2:43:21] <%floralkami> Yeah, I'm liking this new Kazuga Ichiban's look
[2:43:21] <Kalinflip> @noobpsyboticus Its a verrry thin line between the two
[2:43:28] <Admiral_PopnFresh> oh for real, the NPC is using a Lewis gun
[2:43:29] <Run44forrest> whats nightcry

[2:44:02] <SulfurousAcid> don't run over people's cars with your dog
[2:44:03] <artoflec> The new guy in Yakuza 7 really likes Dragon Quest, and they got permission to actually name drop Dragon Quest
[2:44:04] <AbysmalWulf> ... Run over peoples car. With your dog?
[2:44:05] <crazy_laughter> Cars with your dog?

[2:44:22] <%starotter70> Think of those poor convertibles BibleThump
[2:44:28] <%RubberFistFight> @Run44forrest getting attacked whilst needing to go to the toilet during a session of checking the fridge.
[2:44:31] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> You gotta show those kids playing with Hot Wheels who's boss
[2:44:44] <%InugamiTheHound> the new yakuza 7 title sounds likea kingdom hearts gam LOL
[2:44:44] <%howlesmovingcock> doodBenny
[2:44:45] <notToph> Yakuza 7 is actually a turn based RPG apparently Pat LUL
[2:44:48] <shevan123> how the turn tables
[2:45:08] <%Piemen99> was it checking it's watch?
[2:45:10] <+VapingNeckbeard> @AngriestPat first time catching your stream.. i love how you're taking your time and checking out lore and stuff.. seen 2 others playing this game today and they were just sort of rushing through
[2:45:15] <Dao_Puppy> What's this about Yakuza 7 being a Pachinko game now?
[2:45:16] <@lewdskeletor13> I refuse to believe Yakuza 7 is actually turn based
[2:45:21] <@lewdskeletor13> That has to be a joke
[2:45:21] <Run44forrest> whats the porn minigame in yak 7 gonna be
[2:45:23] <FlyguyJP> Not nessesarily, the HQ lobby was in New York but this is heavily implied to be some gateway shit to another dimension. You blast a wall and will find the void outthere
[2:45:33] <%starotter70> @lewdskeletor13 I refuse to believe it's not
[2:45:34] <notToph> lewdskeletor13 look up Famitsu's twitter, they have screenshots of the event
[2:45:39] <Rayorin> attacked by ragdolls?
[2:45:39] <FunkyStreams> @VapingNeckbeard Pat likes to take his time.
[2:45:40] <%miguelrod777> talking to girls in cosplay cafes
[2:45:47] <@lewdskeletor13> No I refuse
[2:45:54] <%Laecerelius> It'd be great if they made an RPG minigame in it
[2:45:56] <collindoucet99> Fuck this game is gorgeous
[2:45:58] <%Bad1uck> @OranHexthief I'm fairly sure this place uses non-flat geometry. So folded space within it's boundaries
[2:46:01] <%howlesmovingcock> Yakuza 7 is in Fortnite
[2:46:04] <FlyguyJP> AMBUSH
[2:46:08] <@lewdskeletor13> Why tf would I want a turn based Yakuza 7
[2:46:15] <%Shadicara> CROSS FIAH
[2:46:18] <+VapingNeckbeard> @FunkyStreams i appreciate that in a streamer, especially when it's a new game with as much depth as this :)
[2:46:22] <rubbishbinge> wasn't the yakuza rpg a mock up to celebrate dragon quest or something
[2:46:29] <%Piemen99> that some warlock punches

[2:46:53] <Rayorin> if that shield could explode outward, it'd be awesome
[2:47:00] <artoflec> it IS fucking trun based
[2:47:00] <%starotter70> @rubbishbinge I thought it was for April fools or something

[2:57:55] <ToneBacas> what game chat? I'm out of the loop
[2:57:57] <formalcasting> OMG it is turnbased
[2:57:58] <formalcasting> whyyy
[2:58:03] <Zombrocom> It's a straight up JRPG with party memebers and shit
[2:58:07] <%starotter70> @ToneBacas Yakuza 7
[2:58:10] <Hydrapissed> why cant HE crawl
[2:58:12] <%Scarnehu> eddie makuch confirmed it in gamespot earlier today
[2:58:13] <%InugamiTheHound> she didn't get Adam's permission
[2:58:14] <laguerrilha> Why make it like TEPPEN and not like FE?
[2:58:15] <%SoFarFetched> @ToneBacas Yakuza 7 is going to be Turn Based because main character girl likes Dragon Quest.
[2:58:16] <%Anonymasque> Hold on guys I'm looking into this. Anon is on the case.
[2:58:17] <FlyguyJP> TSA checkpoint
[2:58:18] <%floralkami> I thought that was just a fan video of a "What if" like 9 months ago
[2:58:22] <%cureneckbeard> metroid is a proud woman, she doesn't crawl
[2:58:29] <%floralkami> But yeah, chat is right
[2:58:32] <%dumemoto> Can't she just magic the door open
[2:58:34] <formalcasting> maybe its only one or two chapters or something
[2:58:39] <%floralkami> Yakuza is turn based now
[2:58:40] <Valdorick> I want it to be like, a mix of legit turnbased combat, and Vagrant Story.
[2:58:41] <Monkeyweed21> ITS REAL PERSONAKUZA
[2:58:43] <%starotter70> Why are you booing me, I'm right
[2:58:43] <FlyguyJP> Put your metal in the basket and then the door will open
[2:58:43] <cascadepersona> HAHA. Turn-based games are my jam.
[2:58:44] <%RubberFistFight> @cureneckbeard metroit is a pretty cool guy, eh kills aleins and dosnt afraid of anything
[2:58:50] <%SoFarFetched> That would be weird for it to just be turn base on the first two chapters.
[2:58:51] <%PauliusMaximus> all i see is that they did an april fools joke with yakuza 7 turn based
[2:58:53] <%axellogic> Oh the turned based is real
[2:58:56] <%floralkami> Can subs post links?
[2:58:56] <%sl8r4l8r> JUST CRAWL THROUGH
[2:58:57] <%rumtumtugnutz> Yeah it's legit. Yakuza 7 combat is turn based
[2:58:59] <derekwst3> @AngriestPat really stop the game and look there is turn based yakuza
[2:59:02] <FlyguyJP> BABY
[2:59:05] <%SoFarFetched> don't post links,pat will look it up later.

[2:59:15] <@lewdskeletor13> I refuse to believe they took out the ducking combat, one of the best parts of the game
[2:59:17] <%SoFarFetched> probably once he's done playing.

[2:59:35] <FunkyStreams> As long as the story is as campy and cool I really wouldn't care if they redux the comabt system.
[2:59:38] <Caidezes> ...So Yakuza 7 looks lame. Buumer.
[2:59:39] <%Anonymasque> I think the developers are having a laugh but it's going too far NotLikeThis
[2:59:39] <FlyguyJP> Turned Based Yakuza is just a nightmare and we will all wake up soon
[2:59:41] <%starotter70> Has a trailer even dropped yet?

[2:59:43] <laguerrilha> @lewdskeletor13 it was pretty basic dude
[2:59:43] <%floralkami> @lewdskeletor13 maybe they don't want it to compete with Judgment
[2:59:44] <cascadepersona> It's 2019, and Sakura Wars is now an Action RPG while Yakuza is now a Turn-based RPG.
