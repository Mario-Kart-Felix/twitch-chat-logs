[0:29:07] <flattopswag> From WI -- it really shouldn't be 18 guys, people are DUMB
[0:29:10] <damienlunas> Underage drinking is FAR from the worst thing Pat has advocated.
[0:29:10] <%mister___doctor> Ssaryn if people are fucking stupid then it shouldn't be 18

[0:33:41] <%Atom1241> I leave because I haven't played this and want to experience it for myself
[0:33:42] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> what stream? People come here for the PODCAST
[0:33:43] <+Kawaso> I'm only here for hollow Knight

[0:34:02] <%President_Miyazaki> That's not fair. Portal is hard to watch sometimes.
[0:34:03] <%lutefiiisk> Pat= <1000 views, Paige 1000 views. Pat+Paige=1600 vires
[0:34:04] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> yeah but it's Paige playing portal
[0:34:04] <EVA_Unit02> No one wants ze bad gameplay LUL
[0:34:05] <viewtifulr> but also max went on and stole everyone
[0:34:07] <+SparkAfterDark> Pat that's because I can donate money to make you say funny things. I can't donate money to make you play better.
[0:34:07] <fattness132> pat that is because paige killed them with her lack of puzzle skills
[0:34:09] <+LazyRabb1t> well its like a podcast before a stream. people love podcasts
[0:34:09] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> or trying at least.

[0:34:51] <ItsHoeJoe95> Wholesome stream
[0:34:55] <kamen_advent> It's okay Pat, those weirdos are just missing out on wonderful moments like Paige's brain breaking on momentum puzzles in Portal
[0:34:57] <Dakuu75> why is that a thing now? I saw a dude give out 5 subs on Max's stream the other night too
[0:34:58] <dandyspider> pat is a red sith yoda

[0:35:06] <$Chimeraelite> micro sleeps
[0:35:13] <element_of_loyalty> THEY DO EXIST
[0:35:14] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> once Pat switches over to the game I'm just leaving the stream in background and keep playing New Vegas.
[0:35:15] <@SSaryn> Microsleeps are weird.
[0:35:15] <%Ssaik> oh of course she doesn't
[0:35:16] <Frade> when is red bull promotional stream? OpieOP

[0:35:20] <%maskedriderhero> ive had those
[0:35:23] <flattopswag> Dude I get those during FFXIV raids -- I die a bit
[0:35:23] <%lutefiiisk> Fun fact: When you and paige are streaming, I just put on my bluetooth headphones and go for a long walk.
[0:35:23] <+SparkAfterDark> The hallucinations happened
[0:35:23] <SatansDick1> paige has inherited crazytalk
[0:35:23] <%BioApple> but the hallucinations are the best part
[0:35:24] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> Micro sleeps are a thing.
[0:35:26] <%MaiHusbando9S> babbysleeps
[0:35:26] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> hahaha
[0:35:28] <element_of_loyalty> I LOVE THEM
[0:35:29] <+Leroytirebiter> I've had microsleeps while driving, and that was fucking horrifying. don't drive sleepy folks.
[0:35:30] <TyrantSlime> It's the brain's emergency reboots
[0:35:30] <$Chimeraelite> never halucinated though
[0:35:35] <+CrystalLakeWasJusASetback> Microsleep is def a thing. Happened to me all the time in the military.
[0:35:36] <Darkrun2> hallucinations are FUCKED
[0:35:37] <archxeno> the sleep IS the illusion
[0:35:39] <President_valentine> I think that was a plot point in one of the nightmare on elm street movies
[0:35:40] <xeros720> there's probably a better name for em, but yeah, i've had those
[0:35:42] <fattness132> i tried the free weekend and loved it
[0:35:42] <DagetSparrow> Hallucinations, or micro sleeps, choose your fighter
[0:35:43] <+TheStarvingGood> The hallucinations need to be let out
[0:35:43] <%SOMAmilk> the shadow people appear...
[0:35:48] <+SammyKiller> love siege, im a platinum 3
[0:35:49] <%TheFilth> there was that guy who tried to stay awake for like a week, apparently he was sleeping while awake
[0:35:50] <%MrDrayko> take acid of offset the nosleep hallucinations, simple
[0:35:51] <element_of_loyalty> CE Beck?
[0:35:51] <Enthaarungscreme> Have you considered just having a psychitic break
[0:35:52] <%Cynful_Pleasures> CUZ ITS BAD
[0:35:53] <arcadeking48> Micro sleeps exist, they happen to me all the time when I don't get enough sleep cause my brain is all fucked up.
[0:35:58] <%Cynful_Pleasures> SIEGE IS A BAD GAME
[0:36:01] <@SSaryn> So is Frost, she's pretty cool.
[0:36:02] <element_of_loyalty> ROCKET RICHARD
[0:36:03] <+Roundelay11> had a no sleep hallucination that led into a panic attack once, THAT was fun

[0:36:08] <%Cynful_Pleasures> SIEGE IS BAD
[0:36:08] <@SSaryn> NO
[0:36:08] <SatansDick1> thats why he sucks
[0:36:08] <+Heart0fInk> I hate hallucinations. i get them more often then i'd like
[0:36:08] <%maskedriderhero> I rememeber working at Hooters, and I was so tired I was falling asleep on my feet, and at one point, I was using the grill press, and fell asleep, hitting my neck on the handle, and woke back up
[0:36:13] <flattopswag> I can't even think of Canadians other than Lucio
[0:36:13] <+SammyKiller> get gud
[0:36:14] <%ArcanumMBD> Maybe if montreal wasn't such a shit city
[0:36:17] <+Leroytirebiter> acid + sleep deprivation = bad bad time
[0:36:18] <@SSaryn> She IS a Canadian and that is what counts.
[0:36:19] <$RaikenTB> Where is Abigail from?
[0:36:24] <StrawberryPantsu> Abigail is from Canada
[0:36:25] <MrMexicansPinataAdventure> Jokes on you, I hallucinated plenty. Sleep deprivation is a bad time.
[0:36:27] <%ZalotAngel> I remember grinding Eureka in 14 for 36 hours straight, not good when you start seeing shit that isn't there
[0:36:28] <%MrDrayko> oh god i thought they meant the MK character
[0:36:30] <+comfyman12> She is actually from Vancouver
[0:36:30] <element_of_loyalty> DRING
[0:36:32] <SatansDick1> who cares about canada
[0:36:33] <%BioApple> I start to get microsleeps at like the 20-hour mark, I'll never be a big awake man
[0:36:34] <vectorcannonready> what about punchout?
[0:36:36] <Happy_Karl> Microsleeps are totally a thing. That's how people get into car crashes when driving while tired. That and just generally falling asleep, but it doesn't even need 10 seconds for shit to go horribly wrong.
[0:36:39] <element_of_loyalty> TONTO

[0:38:13] <+chrimbooooo> its like a physical version of the layout for your stream
[0:38:13] <cerberuscarmine> its a board with butoons
[0:38:14] <+Leroytirebiter> search it, pretty neat for the price
[0:38:14] <$Mendin> You use that to hack the ICE during a Shadowrun
[0:38:14] <+SammyKiller> sounds like hentai
[0:38:16] <dandyspider> sound like mixer thing
[0:38:17] <+Trenr> it is a thing, it's pretty cool too
[0:38:18] <@SSaryn> Basically a big fat ol' panel with progammable buttons for Twitch.
[0:38:18] <+chrimbooooo> that you can change
[0:38:18] <%Straylightgg> literally just google Elgato Streamdeck
[0:38:19] <+vixenpunch> Card game obv

[0:38:21] <+guyalex> for your stream cards, duh

[0:38:22] <element_of_loyalty> Pecka
[0:38:23] <blackbaron98> deck of streams
[0:38:23] <%cervidaequus> Like a mixer
[0:38:24] <%TDotGoat> it's like a keyboard, but does less
[0:38:24] <KaiserRolled> The buttons can do various commands, like asoundboard or macros and shit
[0:38:25] <+JD_Lars> Get a Streamdeck
[0:38:26] <+Heart0fInk> Fuck Elgato
[0:38:26] <ROBOSAPION6499> @lokiluko well the shows takes place in Japan and a lot of his life does too so pretty sure he is from Japan but the names he uses are just flashier
[0:38:27] <%maskedriderhero> Its your Duel Monsters deck
[0:38:31] <+creamandsugar> @AngriestPat it has programable buttons that can be automatically set to work with different programs like streamlabs
[0:38:34] <$Smolkupo> It's a Yu Gi Oh deck silly
[0:38:34] <+SparkAfterDark> It's sort of like what dj's use to pretend they're real musicians but for streamers
[0:38:35] <KaiserRolled> Elgato is shit though
[0:38:36] <$Smolkupo> heez
[0:38:40] <element_of_loyalty> SHOW US

[0:43:28] <%SOMAmilk> the legend of hellsahke yano is so good
[0:43:31] <+Leroytirebiter> because D&D is rad

[0:49:39] <%korth367> she doesnt really say much
[0:49:39] <%ArcanumMBD> I think it's just RNG. She'll get back eventually maybe
[0:49:40] <%Ninestempest> this is amusing
[0:49:43] <+GrimSquirrel> she comes back
[0:49:43] <%korth367> just creeps on you

[0:50:12] <+ShinyMonger> She'll randomly be on and off the bench depending on what part in the game you're in.
[0:50:14] <$magikestral> crystal peak is the best place to go, honestly- its compact and has some nice stuff
[0:50:14] <MarylandJutsu> PROGRESS? IN MY PAT STREAM?
[0:50:21] <SatansDick1> go to the city of tears
[0:50:22] <Kghaleon> I think Crystal peak is a higher level area

[0:52:03] <%Calicodream> Now Pat, when you get there, make sure to pick somewhere else to go
[0:52:03] <+Jacknzack27> Pat its super not worth it at this point
[0:52:03] <Scorchfield> eh thats ok, if he didn't get what he needed to there he might as well go back to it
[0:52:03] <arcadeking48> Wait, I looked away for 30 seconds, why are we going to Detroit again?
[0:52:04] <deviljhojho94> FUCK YOU PAT
[0:52:04] <Nedlin> Hahaha this is great
[0:52:05] <Kirijuo> @angriestpat now the peaks are the biggest one
[0:52:07] <+JustToWatch> AS BAD AS ITS EVER BEEN

[0:52:13] <+TsunamiPoro> I WANT THE RELEASE OF DEATH
[0:52:15] <%Lion_kun> PAT YOU CANT KEEP DOING THIS
[0:52:16] <%Trekalone> there's no progress you can get in deepest right now...
[0:52:16] <ArgentUndaCova> \ SeriousSloth /
[0:52:16] <%Spydurman> how can a man so small be so powerful
[0:52:17] <+Enderborn18> THIS IS WORSE THAN OMIKRON

[0:52:29] <leole11> YOU CAN'T
[0:52:30] <Zinectrik> HE CANT KEEP GETTING AWAY WITH THIS
[0:52:30] <@StridentSong> Pat actively trolling the stream
[0:52:31] <MyNameIsRasus> pat do i have shit taste for not being a fan of eva in general?
[0:52:40] <element_of_loyalty> GO LO HO DO
[0:52:45] <sparrrow_> yes
[0:52:47] <ape_hawk> no
[0:52:48] <ancrest_tant> "I'm gonna do my thing and you can't stop me...oh I should go back okay..."
[0:52:49] <+GrimSquirrel> yes
[0:52:49] <Donchalant402> NGE, is DECENT but its overrated
[0:52:50] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> no
[0:52:51] <Zeemod155> No
[0:52:51] <Sol_Install> no
[0:52:51] <KaiserRolled> No, eva is super overrated
[0:52:51] <+TeethMuncher> yes
[0:52:53] <%Remery_> no
[0:52:53] <deviljhojho94> The robots are a cool
[0:52:57] <flattopswag> I both like it and dislike it
[0:53:02] <+Winnosh> I've been enjoying this game a lot. there so much stuff in it that you can miss
[0:53:03] <+vixenpunch> NEW TIMELINE, CHANGE YOUR FATE
[0:53:07] <%Cogito1001> Nah, its pretty garbo.
[0:53:08] <AncelDeLambert> "it fucking wierd"
[0:53:09] <sparrrow_> Shinji literally jerks off on an unconscious girl man
[0:53:10] <+GenesisKnight> Do Evas even count as mechs
[0:53:12] <%Lion_kun> All the characters in eva are hot garbage
[0:53:13] <Snookasaurus> raisin
[0:53:15] <+SailingSaturn> most of the lore is hidden NotLikeThis
[0:53:16] <%Lion_kun> Except Masato
[0:53:16] <%skizzuto> still haven't seen it myself
[0:53:19] <TyrantSlime> I don't like EVA because I had a super obnoxious friend who loved it
[0:53:20] <dandyspider> eva has a pretty slow and boring start
[0:53:20] <SatansDick1> hey peoplle have different tastes
[0:53:25] <Dakuu75> I'm not a fan of this game's aesthetics. I prefer momodora 3 or death's gambit and dead cells
[0:53:25] <element_of_loyalty> Psycho IS GROUND BREAKING
[0:53:27] <%ToxInjection> YOU HAVEN'T WATCHED DEATH NO- I MEAN EVANGELION?!?! NotLikeThis
[0:53:32] <MattDemers> IT BROKE NEW GROUND
[0:53:33] <deviljhojho94> IT BROKE NEW GROOOOUUUUND
[0:53:34] <$SGrim> I like everything about the show, except the main driving force of the plot, and it's writer. rooShrug
[0:53:35] <%Divryne> Eva is important because it defined a lot of the anime tropes we see in anime today.
[0:53:35] <+TeethMuncher> @SatansDick1 but isn't that root of all evil?
[0:53:37] <%Calicodream> This game kind of reminds me of Ori and the Blind Forest
[0:53:38] <MattDemers> @deviljhojho94 <3
[0:53:39] <TheCrook92> im such a weeb, i thought you were saying Saiko
[0:53:42] <alex_id> Nica @ToxInjection
[0:53:44] <sparrrow_> Pat has shit taste for not watching Hunter X Hunter
[0:53:44] <deviljhojho94> @MattDemers My man
[0:53:44] <%ssjklyco> It's like how star wars is good, but people don't like 70% of what is release.
[0:53:46] <alex_id> Nice*
[0:53:49] <SatansDick1> @TeethMuncher fuck you
[0:53:57] <DXLelouch24> Pat if you love lore go do Crystal Nest first
[0:53:58] <DXLelouch24> trust me
[0:54:01] <Coystick> SO SAD SO GOOD
[0:54:02] <asbestosflavored> best area music SourPls
[0:54:06] <dandyspider> just watch/read getter robo
[0:54:07] <SeventyForce> Guy wanted to die for reals
[0:54:09] <+TeethMuncher> @SatansDick1 it's true though
[0:54:10] <Dakuu75> really?
[0:54:10] <+GenesisKnight> Never forget. FLCL is so goofy because the studio needed something to cure their collective depression post Eva
[0:54:10] <DXLelouch24> JUICY LORE PAT
[0:54:10] <Coystick> Absence of Happiness makes me happy
[0:54:10] <+Winnosh> EVA is more important for what it is than what it does
[0:54:11] <Hybrid_Niji> still is
[0:54:12] <+SvenHolgersson> WATCH HUNTER X HUNTER YOU COWARD
[0:54:14] <lilytastic> which show is this :o
[0:54:16] <deviljhojho94> just watch FLCL
[0:54:17] <Kalcom> "at the time"
[0:54:19] <+TsunamiPoro> and is still going insane
[0:54:19] <danzig2> ive seen few shows where characters just begin failing and dont come back
[0:54:21] <%lutefiiisk> WATCH HUNTER X HUNTER! DO IT!
[0:54:21] <+RollTheD20> just go watch Devilman Crybaby
[0:54:23] <Coystick> They made FLCL after to cheer themselves up
[0:54:26] <+shadowace2400> Pat do Crystal Nest
[0:54:28] <gespenst_mr_ghost> Understandable
[0:54:31] <deviljhojho94> Just watch 70s devilman
[0:54:33] <%wolfishfang> have you seen or read spice and wolf?
[0:54:33] <SatansDick1> i personally like eva cuz i have bad depression but i get why people dont like it
[0:54:33] <element_of_loyalty> Tommy Wiseau level of depression?
[0:54:34] <+GenesisKnight> LUL
[0:54:34] <%Divryne> LUL
[0:54:35] <RainMews> EVA is overrated
[0:54:35] <MelBrooksKA> @lilytastic Eva
[0:54:35] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat the story blew up the consistency of his plot to scream at the world how much he hated God. The tonal shift is the worst part. rooREE
[0:54:36] <%skizzuto> LUL
[0:54:36] <%ToxInjection> I haven't checked it out myself, to be totally honest. I don't think I could watch older anime, no matter how much of a classic they are. I'm a huge baby that likes modern shit.
[0:54:39] <leole11> lol
[0:54:40] <+AntithesisEK> Just actually read Devilman
[0:54:43] <Happy_Karl> Just like Citizen Kane, it's important to film making in terms of techniques, but it's horribly BORING.
[0:54:43] <%Straylightgg> watch a real anime like Death Note apatSmug
[0:54:43] <MyNameIsRasus> nah it's important, i get it,just don't care much for it
[0:54:44] <asbestosflavored> where you got spore charm
[0:54:46] <Kghaleon> I'm just surprised the show from the 90s that I watched as a teen is still popular.
[0:54:46] <deviljhojho94> just become devilman
[0:54:49] <Parapattern> Is the new FLCL any good? I haven't heard a thing about it.
[0:54:51] <%Remery_> Does Pat have shit taste in best girl?
[0:54:53] <+Gorgen> Nichijo is best mech anime
[0:54:54] <Donchalant402> you went too far
[0:54:55] <+SparkAfterDark> Eva is the raw shit mixed into the ground that allows other actually good plants to grow. Yeah it's an important part of gardening and you should understand why, but that doesn't mean you're weird if you don't want it on your plate
[0:54:56] <$Mendin> Go on, galaga, son no cherry
[0:54:58] <%AbnormalVoid> GOOO OOONNN

[0:56:14] <Coystick> Eva Unit 01 is the coolest mecha in history I swear to God.
[0:56:16] <ThisIsAnOddName> Did Pat save Zote the second time?
[0:56:20] <%ArcanumMBD> Lantern only helps in pitch black rooms (which there are some in deepnest, just not here)

[0:57:02] <+JustToWatch> its not like you made any progress to advance the story
[0:57:06] <AncelDeLambert> I hope Pat bawls his eyes out
[0:57:08] <%korth367> deepnest there to scare you
[0:57:11] <deviljhojho94> pat retweeted some fanart of himself as a hollow bug and he looks really good
[0:57:14] <Kirijuo> @AngriestPat While you're here are you just gonna finish Deep Nest?

[0:57:43] <Donchalant402> its two rooms
[0:57:55] <DraxTD> @AngriestPat pat talks about small things on next weeks podcast
[0:57:58] <SatansDick1> small rooms for small bois
[0:58:07] <asbestosflavored> FailFish
[0:58:10] <%BioApple> building a tramway

[0:58:13] <Donchalant402> they failed at making a tramway
[0:58:13] <gespenst_mr_ghost> Not getting eaten
[0:58:13] <AncelDeLambert> Pat, vitality stuff
[0:58:14] <+TsunamiPoro> a skilled roy can beat any tramway
[0:58:16] <KaiserRolled> making a tramway?

[0:58:19] <+JustToWatch> building the tramway
[0:58:20] <%ArcanumMBD> blue butterfly in the previous room
[0:58:20] <thisisacoolguy> They failed at making a tramway

[0:58:26] <%Trekalone> building a tramway
[0:58:26] <Kirijuo> It's literally just not finished
[0:58:28] <deviljhojho94> building a tramway, solving the problem
[0:58:28] <+willowisper> building it in general I suppose
[0:58:28] <%Divryne> BLACK EVIL.
[0:58:28] <Jaller101514> Blue butterfly
[0:58:33] <dandyspider> go up by blue butterfly for something special
[0:58:37] <SatansDick1> they failed at making the tramway
[0:58:37] <sparrrow_> my main gripe with this game is the areas aren't unique enough
[0:58:38] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat they probably dug up all those fuck off centipedes and died. rooWut
[0:58:42] <DXLelouch24> he was about to get a items that changes the game forever, but SOMEONE decided to change his mind
[0:58:42] <AncelDeLambert> the area is COVERED IN CORPSES
[0:58:45] <%ArcanumMBD> I dont remember this foreground effect when I played. I wonder if they added it
[0:58:46] <$magikestral> tons and tons of eggs. They didn't like the tramway being built
[0:59:03] <element_of_loyalty> BIRTHING
[0:59:05] <SatansDick1> is pat secretly eggman

[0:59:51] <TerraWraith> Areas go up
[0:59:52] <strangelee> no
[0:59:53] <powerprotoman> no pat it means you can ride the zeplin
[0:59:54] <%Trekalone> not this one
[0:59:54] <thisisacoolguy> Man this game can get real fuckin creepy when it wants to
[0:59:55] <element_of_loyalty> Got exact change?
[0:59:55] <arcadeking48> Id say that was worth coming back for
[0:59:58] <$magikestral> @angriestpat there's two; one here in deepnest, and one up at the crossroads
[1:00:03] <+JustToWatch> yes, but you should REALLY go back to cyrstal peak now
[1:00:05] <Donchalant402> @AngriestPat now go back to where you JUST backed down from crystal peak
[1:00:05] <$Mendin> You can now RIDES ZE SHOOPUF
[1:00:06] <DXLelouch24> now go get that fucking nail
[1:00:07] <hassanico> Yo let's send him towards the deepnest boss
[1:00:13] <+shadowace2400> To be fair to Shinji, he's a young, isolated kid, called by the father he barely knows to a city he doesn't know to fight in a WAR FOR THE SURVIVAL OF HUMANITY, when he has zero training and has no idea what's going on most of the time. Most kids wouldn't have done as well as he did as far as I can tell.
[1:00:13] <Donchalant402> you barely missed some new shit AGAIN
[1:00:17] <DXLelouch24> AND IGNORE ARCANUM FOREVER
[1:00:17] <correctedsun117> cheer1000 Hey @AngriestPat, just got hit with a surprise breakup yesterday, thanks for still being there to help cheer me up, man.

[1:01:12] <Futurecity10> Dig up stupid
[1:01:14] <$magikestral> they go away after sitting at a bench
[1:01:21] <Snookasaurus> nope lmao
[1:01:21] <+Omed250> Just reach 100 percent completion with this game on switch, holy shit was it amazing
[1:01:27] <megamonmon123> drop your shield
[1:01:27] <$Plutt_bug> Dig down smartypants
[1:01:30] <DXLelouch24> no you didnt Omed
[1:01:34] <+JustToWatch> if you want some real movement abilities though, go to crystal peak again
[1:01:35] <hassanico> Did Pat fight Nosk yet?
[1:01:35] <Kirijuo> But the real question is, can the Eva Unit beat GOKU?
[1:01:35] <%ArcanumMBD> @arcadeking48 the blue hearts are temporary shield hearts, if thats what you're confused about
[1:01:36] <DXLelouch24> Godmasters coming
[1:01:38] <DXLelouch24> also
[1:01:43] <sparrrow_> lmao that's your own fault man
[1:01:44] <DXLelouch24> 100% isnt the max
[1:01:48] <Quantumsheep1> Like Woolie?
[1:01:49] <Donchalant402> it bug souls metroidvania editions
[1:01:50] <DXLelouch24> MWHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
[1:01:51] <+shadowace2400> azivate_ eh, I couldn't get into it when I tried
[1:01:59] <danzig2> its metroid dark souls
[1:02:07] <+Omed250> Is the max 106 percent?
[1:02:07] <%BioApple> metroid is the dark souls of metroid
[1:02:08] <Coystick> CastleSouls
[1:02:10] <Prevot> it totally feels like metroid pat
[1:02:10] <%ssjklyco> For a while, I thought it was a Shovel Knight expansion
[1:02:11] <SatansDick1> darksoulvania
[1:02:11] <Kalcom> pat
[1:02:11] <KaiserRolled> I don't really get the dark souls comparison at all
[1:02:11] <$Plutt_bug> CaSouls
[1:02:12] <powerprotoman> thats ebcause you drink too much redbull
[1:02:12] <%lutefiiisk> Just like dark souls go UP
[1:02:13] <Kalcom> the fuck
[1:02:13] <%President_Miyazaki> Is this the Dark Souls of Metroidvanias?
[1:02:13] <+GenesisKnight> Soulsvania
[1:02:15] <strangelee> It's a fucking Castlevania game
[1:02:17] <leole11> darksoulsvania?
[1:02:17] <@thenefftw> It's a Metroidvania
[1:02:20] <+th3madness> the dark souls of metroidvanias
[1:02:21] <Coystick> Hollowvania
[1:02:23] <Prevot> this is not similar to castlevania at all
[1:02:24] <arcadeking48> @ArcanumMBD Im more confused by what the fuck was with those butterflies and the goo, I figured they were Soul Hearts. Thanks for the explanation though :)
[1:02:24] <sparrrow_> also the jellyfish are literally metroids
[1:02:24] <Them00n> Castlevania and Darksouls are metrodvanias.
[1:02:25] <+SvenHolgersson> PAT HOW
[1:02:27] <MyNameIsRasus> SOULSVANIA
[1:02:28] <+TeethMuncher> It's aggressively dark soulds to a fault
[1:02:28] <Kalcom> that's what a metroidvania
[1:02:29] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> CaSoulsVania
[1:02:31] <%BioApple> I called it a side-souler in a previous stream, everyone please support me
[1:02:32] <$shadow1man9> Need Time Stop=
[1:02:35] <leole11> M A R K
[1:02:38] <+Jacknzack27> How on earth is this not metroidvania
[1:02:38] <+HDmexiqtioner> Hi Pat, Hi Chat. How is everyone?
[1:02:38] <AncelDeLambert> hi ded fren
[1:02:39] <+th3madness> oh pat doesn't have the thing
[1:02:39] <+willowisper> I would mark it for later
[1:02:39] <DXLelouch24> max is 107%
[1:02:39] <zal_silverfang> yeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyyeyeye
[1:02:41] <sparrrow_> People throw around the word Metroidvania too much
[1:02:41] <@SSaryn> Yeah that totally not boss Kappa
[1:02:41] <SatansDick1> come back later with time stop
[1:02:41] <thisisacoolguy> "I'm done with deepnest" - lolll
[1:02:41] <DXLelouch24> for now

[1:02:50] <Donchalant402> @AngriestPat make whereever you seen corpses or graves
[1:02:50] <+Aztec50> Surely Dark Souls is a Metroidvania
[1:02:51] <+TeethMuncher> Time stop that corpse
[1:02:51] <+Jacknzack27> Mark it
[1:02:52] <Donchalant402> there is always shit

[1:02:53] <SatansDick1> mark it
[1:02:55] <+G_Thunders> Come back with time stop
[1:02:55] <CapCasual> !uptime
[1:02:55] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 2m 57s.
[1:02:56] <%ssjklyco> no, it's a Metroidvania. Save points are not limited to souls
[1:02:59] <+JustToWatch> you NEED to go back to crystal peak for about a dozen reasons
[1:03:01] <ThisIsAnOddName> This is a byproduct of you guys having a fucked up definition of Metroidvania
[1:03:04] <element_of_loyalty> bench
[1:03:06] <AncelDeLambert> Dark Souls is the true spiritual successor to Castlevania
[1:03:06] <megamonmon123> you need to get the shield and then drop it
[1:03:07] <arcadeking48> "What the hell is this room and why is it like this?" summarizes more of the rooms in this game
[1:03:08] <DXLelouch24> CRYSTAL PEAK YOU FUCK
[1:03:09] <%ArcanumMBD> There's a pin you can buy in the shop that will mark that for you i think
[1:03:12] <Majiinbooh> come back here later
[1:03:16] <leole11> gj
[1:03:16] <%ArcanumMBD> I think there's a grave pin?
[1:03:20] <+Winnosh> WAIT WHAT? You can MARK ROOMA?
[1:03:22] <%ssjklyco> The most souls thing is the retreiving your shit
[1:03:25] <SatansDick1> more butter flys
[1:03:26] <Rellim80> So Hallow Knight is the Dark Souls of Bug 'em ups?
[1:03:30] <$Plutt_bug> Does time stop when humanity dies?
[1:03:34] <+TeethMuncher> @Winnosh Yes LUL
[1:03:36] <%Deekman> If we went the other way to crystal caves first we could’ve found out
[1:03:37] <%ArcanumMBD> @Winnosh yeah they added that later on. It's crazy the improvements they added
[1:03:42] <AWinglessMonkey> oh yeah, those are useful when you come back here
[1:03:46] <$Mendin> You have to reject your humanity to stop time
[1:03:46] <AncelDeLambert> AAAAAH okay
[1:03:46] <%lutefiiisk> When is this shit coming out for PS4?
[1:03:50] <element_of_loyalty> GREAT IMPRESSION
[1:03:50] <megamonmon123> @plutt_bug not as long as there are organisms still alive
[1:03:51] <Donchalant402> You started the game at the PERFECT time
[1:03:51] <AppleBoi85> Dream nail it
[1:03:53] <DXLelouch24> oh yea its a boss
[1:03:54] <AncelDeLambert> I played this pretty soon after it came out
[1:03:55] <@SSaryn> Yeah, that's why I'm waiting for Gods and Glory, kind of thinking that'll happen again.
[1:03:56] <DXLelouch24> hehehe
[1:03:57] <Kirijuo> @AngriestPat So fun fact, because of the way you explored Deep Nest you completely missed out on the coolest part of the area
[1:03:59] <Donchalant402> since Godmasters is coming
[1:03:59] <DXLelouch24> youll see
[1:04:06] <SatansDick1> he doesnt have it @AppleBoi85
[1:04:07] <hassanico> Can Pat reach Nosk from here?
[1:04:10] <powerprotoman> there will also eb dlc where you can play as hornet apparantly
[1:04:10] <DXLelouch24> and its getting paid DLC still too
[1:04:14] <DXLelouch24> Hornet playable
[1:04:15] <%Divryne> There's the Hornet DLC still next year.
[1:04:16] <strangelee> Yeah, I'm holding off until that last DLC
[1:04:16] <+th3madness> @AngriestPat you know that it's just the end of free DLC, right?
[1:04:17] <dandyspider> nope, hornet dlc still being made
[1:04:17] <LtThunderbolt> P O D
[1:04:22] <LtThunderbolt> C A S T
[1:04:22] <Donchalant402> @hassanico no, he needs the crystal peak ability
[1:04:22] <+SparkAfterDark> The most souls thing isn't corpse runs, it's the wandering around figuring out what the hell to do, with the only real guide being "hey they guys get tougher in this direction"
[1:04:23] <element_of_loyalty> Dats Woolie
[1:04:24] <%ArcanumMBD> @AngriestPat did Woolie still not beat the true final boss? Cause I'm still upset that he thinks the final boss was easy
[1:04:26] <ValidVenasaur> theres still the Hornet DLC
[1:04:33] <hassanico> @Donchalant402 thanks, dang
[1:04:37] <Prevot> LUL
[1:04:41] <Coystick> B A F F L E D
[1:04:42] <%ToxInjection> LUL
[1:04:44] <Donchalant402> Woolie isnt that smartest person, we know this
[1:04:45] <sparrrow_> Woolie is autistic you shouldn't be surprised
[1:04:46] <Donchalant402> RUN

[1:05:39] <leole11> there's like 5 more after him
[1:05:43] <matrixManipulator> @shadowace2400 That's the difference many people don't get between Shinji Ikari and Yukiteru Amano, Shinji's depression, emotional episodes, lack of resolve at times, cluelessness are in character not only for him, but as a young teenage boy thrust headlong into circumstances he doesn't understand, where Amano just is constantly out of his depth because he doesn't ever truly adapt to said circumstances
[1:05:45] <drinkmoxie> Pat that takes the ability to read and as we all know woolie can’t read
[1:05:49] <AppleBoi85> That face when you're in a game end area and get your ass handed to you
[1:05:53] <thisisacoolguy> Would it be back seating to say this zone has a lot of breakable walls?

[1:08:36] <Nedlin> Pat I think chat's telling you to go to Earthen Peak

[1:13:50] <+Bupkis7> enbLul
[1:13:50] <knomad2b> like blightown
[1:13:51] <+shadowace2400> You won't be able to get the one in this zone right now. Or the one at Crystal Peaks unless you wan't to do a super finicky jump off an enemy
[1:13:54] <DXLelouch24> Pat just give up and get the Lore Nail in Crystal Peak
[1:13:58] <+JustToWatch> Pat, for the love of fuck leave it behind and just go to the confessor
[1:14:00] <asbestosflavored> cloth is sad :(
[1:14:02] <deviljhojho94> just like dead money in New Vegas

[1:14:08] <Prevot> people love blight town?
[1:14:08] <+TeethMuncher> No one likes Blightown
[1:14:09] <Hydrapissed> He thinks this is blgiht town O WAIT
[1:14:09] <Parapattern> LUL
[1:14:11] <AzirothTheGreat> crazy talk is slowly waking up
[1:14:14] <%BioApple> ???
[1:14:16] <zal_silverfang> no. nonono. this is NOT Blighttown pat
[1:14:16] <%unclekulikov> hue
[1:14:17] <gespenst_mr_ghost> Blightpit
[1:14:17] <Coystick> DEAD Money is so fucking GOOD
[1:14:19] <%Divryne> STOP BEING COOl.
[1:14:20] <+MiyamotoSensei> what an old man
[1:14:21] <+Gorgen> WOW
[1:14:21] <asbestosflavored> LUL
[1:14:21] <Prevot> O L D
[1:14:22] <%korth367> stop trying old man
[1:14:23] <deviljhojho94> i adore dead money
[1:14:23] <+NWR_James> People love Blighttown?
[1:14:23] <Vennmaruu_The_Fool> Deepnest is an awful are to PLAY, but it is visually and atmospherically appealing
[1:14:29] <Vennmaruu_The_Fool> area*
[1:14:29] <%radda343> if at first you don't succeed, fail again
[1:14:32] <Donchalant402> @AngriestPat This zone stands out because so much of the game is just a JOY to be in. Great music and visuals, and then you fall into THIS pile of bullshit
[1:14:33] <%ArcanumMBD> I love Deepnest. I love it because it's such a huge contrast to everywhere else in the game.
[1:14:35] <element_of_loyalty> Elmo?
[1:14:36] <sparrrow_> Pat just jinxed himself
[1:14:43] <Scorchfield> people have nostalgia for Blighttown
[1:14:50] <$Chimeraelite> I love it
[1:14:53] <deviljhojho94> christ
[1:14:54] <+NWR_James> that's wrong
[1:14:55] <SatansDick1> blight town is a great horrible area
[1:14:57] <$Chimeraelite> same with the zone in Demon's Souls
[1:14:59] <%radda343> I hope the Switch version makes Blighttown playable
[1:14:59] <%Littleredz98> Why do you like being wrong about things?
[1:15:00] <zettig> I've missed the last couple VODs, but isn't Pat at Deepnest a little early?
[1:15:04] <$Chimeraelite> it SUCKS but it's still awesome
[1:15:09] <$Tredecian> yes he is
[1:15:10] <Arweynn> Deepnest is the bestworst
[1:15:13] <+SparkAfterDark> Blighttown is a mastercraft kick in the dick. I don't wanna get kicked in the dick, but quality is quality
[1:15:15] <DXLelouch24> he still hasnt gotten the dream nail
[1:15:16] <+G_Thunders> Deepnest is a cool area. Blight town forces you to take constant poison damage for the hell of it
[1:15:21] <DXLelouch24> you can blame Arcanum for that
[1:15:22] <%ArcanumMBD> BLASPHEMY
[1:15:26] <+TeethMuncher> Wut?
[1:15:26] <asbestosflavored> D:
[1:15:27] <Coystick> Poor taste
[1:15:28] <Prevot> wow way to have shitty taste
[1:15:31] <SatansDick1> blasphemy
[1:15:31] <deviljhojho94> bukDC
[1:15:33] <knomad2b> you guys have bad taste then
[1:15:33] <element_of_loyalty> cry baby
[1:15:41] <$Tredecian> it grows on you
[1:15:46] <+Enderborn18> what's he talking about
[1:15:48] <ThisIsAnOddName> I'm glad you decided to stop being wrong
[1:15:49] <%ArcanumMBD> @DXLelouch24 I accept all blame. At least there's an easy out at the end of deepenest
[1:15:51] <SatansDick1> are you telling me that pat has bad taste
[1:15:52] <Coystick> It's like Invader Zim via Tim Burton
[1:15:52] <+TeethMuncher> @AngriestPat don't you hate art though?
[1:15:55] <+JavaManJoJo> because you were wrong at first
[1:15:58] <xeros720> later areas are more visually interesting
[1:16:00] <+GrimSquirrel> it works really good in darker areas
[1:16:00] <Nedlin> The game wormed its way into your heart. Just like bugs
[1:16:01] <Parapattern> I loved it right away
[1:16:03] <+Leroytirebiter> it's cohesive, the whole world feels connected through the artstyle
[1:16:05] <Donchalant402> up
[1:16:07] <%ArcanumMBD> dig up stupid
[1:16:09] <Donchalant402> dig up stupid
[1:16:10] <$Tredecian> up
[1:16:13] <+willowisper> The game is very well designed visually
[1:16:15] <SatansDick1> dig up
[1:16:17] <%Spydurman> maybe you needed context of the gameplay to fit that style
[1:16:18] <+Dimfish> the contrast helps the whole game "pop"
[1:16:25] <%kujofire990> DIG UP STUPID
[1:16:30] <Kirijuo> I personally think that the art style plays really well into the games lore and aesthetic, and the game would probably suffer with a different style
[1:16:33] <+vixenpunch> Dig up stupid
[1:16:35] <+shadowace2400> DIG UP STUPID!!!
[1:16:42] <$Tredecian> the shade music
[1:16:42] <Coystick> >game made by 3 Australians >is full of Spiders GG Team Cherry
[1:16:45] <%ArcanumMBD> DIG UP
[1:16:45] <MarylandJutsu> Fake Elmo Grub is BADDDDD
[1:16:50] <Dr_Donkey_Brains> it's where you died

[1:16:52] <Donchalant402> and go UP
[1:16:52] <%skizzuto> it's above you
[1:16:58] <SatansDick1> its where the creepy music play dumbass
[1:17:00] <DXLelouch24> this is made by Austrailians?
[1:17:00] <%BioApple> I think the style leaves too many things too cute, even in this area, but it's still good
[1:17:02] <+shadowace2400> DIG up
[1:17:03] <%ArcanumMBD> go more up
[1:17:03] <+TeethMuncher> It's where you died Kappa
[1:17:06] <Donchalant402> we have answers
[1:17:06] <DXLelouch24> It all makes sense now
[1:17:07] <danzig2> listen for the song
[1:17:08] <+SparkAfterDark> My little corpse can't possibly be this up
[1:17:10] <element_of_loyalty> YES
[1:17:11] <arcadeking48> Its also one of those artstyles that can be both cute and charming, and awful and disconcerting. Sometimes at different times, sometimes at the same time.
[1:17:12] <AWinglessMonkey> the marker is only at the center of the rooom

[1:18:05] <Vennmaruu_The_Fool> Both buttons have a function. You just keep WALKING AWAY FROM PROGRESS
[1:18:06] <Kghaleon> for a certain reason, you will actually want to revisit every area later with a certain thing.

[1:18:24] <element_of_loyalty> THE BABY
[1:18:24] <deviljhojho94> that thing wears a mask that kinda looks like one of the 3 masked guys at the intro and black egg

[1:18:49] <%ArcanumMBD> I actually speedran this game for a bit and legit forget the real way to get Dreamnail, cause speedrunning you do a pogo jump off your shade to get to a transition zone without double jump
[1:18:51] <SatansDick1> prgression is left
[1:18:51] <%BioApple> "that looks like progression, i'm going back" LUL

[1:20:22] <Hydrapissed> you can go everywhere any time BOIIIII
[1:20:24] <%BioApple> @Winnosh you'd be surprised

[1:20:36] <+Winnosh> What is with all of this out of order nonsense?
[1:20:37] <$magikestral> pat is gonna forget to heal and that the enemy hits twice as hard
[1:20:41] <Donchalant402> @Winnosh I never get the ability to use those before coming here

[1:21:12] <+Winnosh> I'm completely lost now. I haven't even Been to this place yet and I have the tree activating power
[1:21:21] <Quantumsheep1> Man, Pat has no fear of these things
[1:21:30] <Donchalant402> I HATE these fuckers
[1:21:31] <Quantumsheep1> He probably should have more
[1:21:32] <Donchalant402> so much

[1:21:43] <DXLelouch24> ACTIVATE
[1:21:44] <+TeethMuncher> @Winnosh pat has a knack for side progress
[1:21:46] <$Tredecian> the game is non linear most people wouldnt be here yet
[1:21:51] <%ArcanumMBD> @Winnosh that's what i love about hollow knight. There are multiple "correct" paths through the game. I played through twice and took different routes both times
[1:21:54] <element_of_loyalty> DWAA
[1:21:59] <+GrimSquirrel> you can get close and wait for them to lower there shield

[1:22:18] <%AbnormalVoid> @AngriestPat I did this about the same time as you, don't feel out of place, the game is very open
[1:22:19] <%ArcanumMBD> This area was also added later
[1:22:19] <+GrimSquirrel> DLC

[1:51:47] <%stigna1> @Jpdodds Not really; volume grows at a cubic ratio to size, but surface area is only square. That means the more big you are, the more weight you have compared to the air resistance slowing your fall. Bones/durability enhancers work the same way with larger bones becoming less relatively effective as their "fracture zone" is a 2D, squared zone.

[2:17:55] <Solidus_113> Brog
[2:17:55] <SatansDick1> gorb is great

[2:18:04] <$Tredecian> fall
[2:18:07] <Nix157> big fall

[2:18:13] <+Dimfish> gorb is the hero of mankin
[2:18:14] <thisisacoolguy> You can tell Gorb is a big brained man because he too watches Rick and Morty
[2:18:15] <+Dimfish> d
[2:18:18] <morcego_cinzento> It's a very good thing that this game has no fall damage
[2:18:18] <%stigna1> Bugs don't take falling damage, no fears.
[2:18:23] <DXLelouch24> can cyclone 1 shot the mask spiders?
[2:18:30] <+JustToWatch> don't worry to much, you'll be back
[2:18:36] <element_of_loyalty> Elmo WITNESS
[2:18:37] <aeonicvector> you could've unlocked luigi there if you just brought donald and goofy tho
[2:18:38] <%bootysteve> something about the size of them
[2:18:42] <%bootysteve> makes them not take fall damage
[2:18:43] <%xemnahort> @DXLelouch24 not even close
[2:18:46] <thisisacoolguy> nah, Cyclone does a lot of damage but you'll get smacked out of it
[2:18:49] <danknugglit> Hollowknight truly is the dars souls of fortnite
[2:18:49] <+Dimfish> no it cant but other charge moves you get can
[2:18:55] <asbestosflavored> oh. it's saturday
[2:18:55] <$Tredecian> theres another thing to expolre for here i think
[2:18:58] <%stigna1> @DXLelouch24 It can kill anything that's not a boss if you land the whole thing with a big strong nail. Its got the highest damage potential of all moves, but its hard to land the whole thing.
[2:18:58] <knomad2b> cyclone can hit like 6 times so ye
[2:19:07] <Quantumsheep1> Pat, remember the secret wall you opened
[2:19:11] <Quantumsheep1> Yeahhhh
[2:19:12] <Rostichenburg> two rooms pat
[2:19:16] <Donchalant402> two rooms
[2:19:17] <%bootysteve> With the hit and run style of this game you really won't get the whole spin off
[2:19:17] <custoadian> There are 2 passages out of here
[2:19:19] <+Gohyakuen> a secret wall bellow too

[2:19:31] <+vixenpunch> 2
[2:19:33] <Kalcom> 2
[2:19:34] <+Dimfish> if every hit of cyclone manages to hit the damage can be substantial

[2:22:01] <+kralec> KINDLY HERETIC!!!
[2:22:01] <DXLelouch24> TTANK TIME
[2:22:04] <Rostichenburg> great for bosses where you can’t heal
[2:22:04] <element_of_loyalty> JONI WAIFU
[2:22:05] <+HypotheticalWalrus> thats a useful one at certain points
[2:22:06] <DXLelouch24> TANK BUILD
[2:22:08] <%TheTakkster> Turns all your masks into blue masks, but doubles your hp
[2:22:09] <haisho> HERESY?!
[2:22:09] <$magikestral> pure magic build
[2:22:09] <hassanico> This one is so good
[2:22:09] <Donchalant402> This charm can combine with hiveblood for some GOOD SHIT
[2:22:10] <cerberuscarmine> TANK
[2:22:10] <strangelee> Hit it
[2:22:11] <+Fenlig> "I'm pat and I think this game is ugly"
[2:22:12] <Tisaric> That's a good niche pickj
[2:22:13] <MrMexicansPinataAdventure> This is base game
[2:22:13] <+GrimSquirrel> double health but cant heal
[2:22:16] <hassanico> Just face tank bosses and go full daamage
[2:22:18] <danknugglit> All these sleeps bishes
[2:22:19] <aeonicvector> 2x hp for only blue hp
[2:22:20] <%stigna1> God I love Hiveblood.
[2:22:20] <KaiserRolled> Try it out and see
[2:22:21] <$Mendin> That's Guppy's Paw from BoI: Turn all your red hearts into soul hearts

[2:22:24] <%BioApple> CASTER BUILD LETS GO
[2:22:25] <SatansDick1> hey pat come back later
[2:22:25] <Kghaleon> It's basically the same power up from binding of isaac, replaces all your hearts with blue
[2:22:26] <+TeethMuncher> @AngriestPat need other charms to combo
[2:22:27] <agustorm123> Facetank
[2:22:27] <SociallyAwkwardToaster> Double health, but it's all lifeblood blue health
[2:22:29] <+Dimfish> glass build
[2:22:29] <Hydrapissed> ONLY DAMAGE no heals
[2:22:30] <+Fenlig> I miss quote what i want
[2:22:32] <Aleate> I heard it. Ugly. Kappa
[2:22:33] <+Bupkis7> double health but can't heal
[2:22:36] <%ArcanumMBD> Someone splice that sound so we have pat saying he thinks HK is ugly
[2:22:37] <+Kawaso> good for specific boss fights
[2:22:42] <Them00n> "I'm Pat and I don't know what a metroidvania is"
[2:22:43] <asbestosflavored> lifeblood is for more than cowards
[2:22:45] <$nademonkey1100> why is it ugly pat why you like this
[2:22:46] <element_of_loyalty> Trico eats BLue Butterflies
[2:22:47] <agustorm123> Tank mode you can get more hits
[2:22:50] <KaiserRolled> "This game is ugly and bad" - direct quote from pat
[2:22:51] <+Gorgen> "im pat and i Stole from my moms purse"
[2:22:52] <+Gohyakuen> great at certain points
[2:22:52] <Tisaric> It's niche foe certain areas
[2:22:55] <KaiserRolled> You're just awful cirBaka
[2:22:55] <Kirijuo> “I think this game is ugly” -Pat
[2:22:55] <Donchalant402> Its REALLY good when you combined it with Hiveblood
[2:22:57] <%BioApple> Pat I can't believe you said this game was a trash fire and also marvel 3 sucks
[2:22:59] <Eresus> it has its uses
[2:23:00] <$Tredecian> there is but you dont have timestop
[2:23:00] <tyrano191> Hive blood is the best
[2:23:00] <$shadow1man9> TIME STOP
[2:23:02] <+TeethMuncher> [CRAZY TALK]
[2:23:03] <%ArcanumMBD> that charm has a single use that you might find later
[2:23:03] <+MetaSla> time stop is the easier way LUL
[2:23:04] <%skizzuto> there is if you had time stop
[2:23:04] <IHATREID> i like using it in the white palace
[2:23:04] <asbestosflavored> you need time stop
[2:23:05] <ValidVenasaur> need ability you cowarded from
[2:23:05] <%stigna1> Its mostly good because you can use all your SOUL to throw spells and do sick damage.
[2:23:05] <SociallyAwkwardToaster> It's actually really useful for fights where there's no time to heal
[2:23:05] <SatansDick1> its actually like the best
[2:23:05] <hassanico> IT IS NOT
[2:23:06] <%xemnahort> easier exit needs TIME STOP
[2:23:08] <SatansDick1> time stop
[2:23:09] <$magikestral> there was with timestop
[2:23:10] <+vixenpunch> It has a huge fucking use
[2:23:10] <Rostichenburg> Should’ve gotten time stop to get out
[2:23:11] <agustorm123> Patt LUL
[2:23:11] <Borealum_EX> if you had timestop
[2:23:11] <+Kawaso> some boss fights you can't heal at all
[2:23:12] <johnny2by4x6> Yeah if you had the one skill
[2:23:14] <+JustToWatch> there are bosses that don't give you much of a healing window
[2:23:15] <$Mendin> It's -Situational- much like half the other charms you're confused of in this game, which is the fun part
[2:23:16] <%falineth> useful for some bosses?
[2:23:17] <MelBrooksKA> "This game is ugly" - Patrick "Fuccboivin" "Patty" Boivin
[2:23:17] <aeonicvector> but what if you had something that did more damage the LESS health you had...
[2:23:18] <SociallyAwkwardToaster> wait. DOES PAT NOT HAVE THAT ABILITY
[2:23:19] <Quantumsheep1> That probably should be an ordinary shortcut, honestly
[2:23:24] <KaiserRolled> You've only seen the baby easy boss fights pat LUL
[2:23:25] <Donchalant402> @Kawaso false, you can always heal
[2:23:29] <Donchalant402> @AngriestPat you have two more to get
[2:23:30] <+JavaManJoJo> Timestop
[2:23:32] <SwindlerOfProgress> It's not worthless. Just think of any boss you have a hard time healing against and there you go.
[2:23:33] <knomad2b> can't belive pat said he hates mgs3
[2:23:34] <hassanico> @SociallyAwkwardToaster He does not have many time stop abilities
[2:23:34] <matrixManipulator> it's good if you don't constantly lose to chumps and spike traps
[2:23:36] <thisisacoolguy> I like the fart noise when the bugs fall into the spikes
[2:23:37] <element_of_loyalty> TIME COP
[2:23:41] <+Bupkis7> There are 4 nail arts
[2:23:43] <SociallyAwkwardToaster> @hassanico oh my god
[2:23:44] <thisisacoolguy> *pffftart*
[2:23:47] <DXLelouch24> and Hornet is getting her own campaign
[2:23:52] <asbestosflavored> all done out of order LUL
[2:23:52] <johnny2by4x6> Yeahah
[2:23:52] <$nademonkey1100> nail art of TIME STOP
[2:23:55] <DXLelouch24> SO PLAYABLE FEMALE BUG VERGIL
[2:23:58] <+Dimfish> all the nail arts are great
[2:23:59] <SatansDick1> i cant believe pat hates RE4
[2:24:00] <leole11> no i get that
[2:24:03] <hassanico> @SociallyAwkwardToaster He has dash and wall jump, that's it
[2:24:05] <soraabora> PAT totally same
[2:24:07] <knomad2b> i can't wait to play hornet
[2:24:08] <+phantomcrono> wait!! there are 4 nail arts?!
[2:24:08] <+GrimSquirrel> 20 mins
[2:24:08] <aeonicvector> @AngriestPat its really fast but they skip a TON
[2:24:08] <hassanico> It uses a bug
[2:24:09] <Eresus> you sure can
[2:24:10] <element_of_loyalty> FEEEL
[2:24:11] <DXLelouch24> THERES A RANDOMIZER
[2:24:14] <hassanico> AGDQ run is super lame and uses bugs
[2:24:14] <johnny2by4x6> Most definitely
[2:24:14] <VanLynx> there's one out now i think
[2:24:15] <agustorm123> It was bad
[2:24:15] <+Gorgodrn> The speedrun are great
[2:24:15] <+sparkletone> there have been two gdq runs of this and they are both great
[2:24:16] <+Fenlig> I remember coming home from work really looking forward to jumping right into this game each day for like 2 weeks
[2:24:16] <DXLelouch24> FOR THIS GAME
[2:24:16] <Astrodoughnaut> deepnest speedrun is cool
[2:24:17] <asbestosflavored> not fond of some of the glitches personally
[2:24:17] <+Dimfish> speedruns are nuts
[2:24:21] <thisisacoolguy> The AGDQ features a lot of anti gravity bugs, it sucks
[2:24:22] <DXLelouch24> YEP
[2:24:24] <$Mendin> WHAT
[2:24:24] <DXLelouch24> A MOD
[2:24:25] <$Tredecian> bugsploits
[2:24:25] <+Worldbrand> IS THERE?
[2:24:25] <MrMexicansPinataAdventure> The bugs are insane Kappa
[2:24:25] <hassanico> It just glitches out of bonds
[2:24:26] <+Gorgodrn> Yeah
[2:24:27] <%stigna1> Oh yeah, the speedrun is cool. Its actually pretty much the DS2 speedrun.
[2:24:27] <+Worldbrand> I WANT IN ON THAT
[2:24:29] <Kghaleon> There's still a shit ton of stuff to go, you probably haven't encountered even half the bosses.
[2:24:29] <+vixenpunch> @angriestpat hey pat if you go fight that boss you skipped wayyy earlier I think you get a pale ore
[2:24:30] <agustorm123> I hate it
[2:24:30] <+WhyIDie> Randomizers, so hot right now

[2:25:07] <leole11> i have never seen that shit
[2:25:08] <cerberuscarmine> cool dlc
[2:25:09] <+ShikiHisashi> Good mark boys
[2:25:10] <hassanico> CLD
[2:25:10] <+WhyIDie> a randomizer is a mod on an existing game that usually changes around upgrade placements
[2:25:11] <MrMexicansPinataAdventure> Timestop and yes
[2:25:11] <element_of_loyalty> RIP
[2:25:13] <$Mendin> Big Good Strong DLC
[2:25:14] <thisisacoolguy> Super important but you need a item later
[2:25:15] <%Divryne> Probably.
[2:25:16] <%stigna1> @Dimfish Oh my gooooood.
[2:25:19] <+JustToWatch> it's dlc, but not end game, you should go back soon
[2:25:20] <+Gorgen> This game has a lack of Bees
[2:25:20] <Donchalant402> oh wait he cant do it yeah
[2:25:24] <$magikestral> it certainly does
[2:25:26] <danknugglit> Poke it with a stick
[2:25:27] <DXLelouch24> Theres a Bonefire mod too THAT COMPLETE CHANGES THE GAME
[2:25:28] <%stigna1> God, Grimm is so cool.
[2:25:29] <%Deekman> Omg I wish you would’ve gone the Crystal way first
[2:25:30] <leole11> no bees, you say?
[2:25:33] <agustorm123> You can do it with time stop
[2:25:35] <MrMexicansPinataAdventure> This game has bees
[2:25:35] <leole11> hold that thought
[2:25:38] <element_of_loyalty> troll
[2:25:38] <+Bupkis7> That looks like the guy who drags you into the painting in DS3
[2:25:38] <%TheTakkster> It all depends on how soon he finds time stop
[2:25:39] <%ssjklyco> OMG, the screaming outside my window sounded like paige
[2:25:41] <%Deekman> could’ve saved time with all these corpses
[2:25:41] <Donchalant402> @JusTTheGuyYouNeed he cant yet
[2:25:44] <asbestosflavored> "it's dlc" is bs imo
[2:25:46] <SatansDick1> @gorgen just wait
[2:25:48] <+aversal_ammar> I like how Pat said how Woolie was dumb for wondering what was DLC
[2:25:49] <leole11> CRYSTAL PEAK
[2:25:53] <%Cynful_Pleasures> NO YOU NEED TO GO ON THE TRAM
[2:25:54] <Donchalant402> but pat you literally cant do the most important thing here yet
[2:25:57] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> "chat is one person and im an idiot" Pat
[2:25:57] <%Cynful_Pleasures> T R A M
[2:25:58] <%korth367> yo but crystal peak tho
[2:25:58] <$nademonkey1100> did he find lake bug yet?
[2:25:59] <%BioApple> @ssjklyco shouldn't have stolen the wcdonalds
[2:26:00] <aeonicvector> you couldve done a TON more here if you JUST had donald and gooft with you
[2:26:00] <+max_radical> yo ive got like 25 hours in this game what are thos fucking spider bois folloiwng pat
[2:26:01] <%xemnahort> fuck you @AngriestPat getting time stop is always the correct answer
[2:26:01] <Rostichenburg> crystal peak
[2:26:02] <KiraKamixephos> @angriestpat are you gonna be playing dead cells?
[2:26:02] <%Trekalone> you mean how right we are?
[2:26:05] <+Gorgen> crikSmash
[2:26:06] <element_of_loyalty> once since
[2:26:07] <KaiserRolled> We get it pat, you were right for a change
[2:26:07] <+GrimSquirrel> YOU SHOULD HAVE
[2:26:08] <%korth367> but do it tho
[2:26:12] <Donchalant402> crystal peak is for losers, tram is hot shit
[2:26:13] <%Deekman> please do crystal peak. It actively adds to the shit you’re finding
[2:26:13] <SociallyAwkwardToaster> Go back to the city first
[2:26:14] <SatansDick1> thats your fault
[2:26:15] <element_of_loyalty> EWW
[2:26:19] <+Dimfish> pat is correct, this genre is built on bumbling progress not absolute efficiency
[2:26:20] <Kghaleon> The Troupe dlc is some BS, there's a branching path and if you choose poorly you miss out on a boss.
[2:26:21] <cerberuscarmine> pffff
[2:26:22] <%Spydurman> everyone yell at him not to go to crystal peak and he'll go
[2:26:23] <Rellim80> It's called reverse psychology
[2:26:23] <leole11> MARK GORB
[2:26:23] <+Bupkis7> Crystal peak has my favorite movement upgrade in the whole game
[2:26:24] <cerberuscarmine> THE DARKNESS
[2:26:24] <agustorm123> LUL never again
[2:26:25] <SatansDick1> city then crystal
[2:26:25] <+GrimSquirrel> it makes all this shit ez to get later
[2:26:30] <+seaearthandsky> Kappa you'tr not wrong
[2:26:34] <powerprotoman> if dolan and gooby were hear youd have already ebaten the game
[2:26:34] <EMP_Ike_Turner> zorb

[2:26:50] <+Gorgodrn> Chat was kinda trying to make you run a more efficient route, but tbf, the game sinks much better when you ahve to do your own backtracking

[2:33:19] <Borealum_EX> it's as if pat is allergic to progression
[2:33:22] <$magikestral> fog canyon has the bank, but its easier to use the tram
[2:33:23] <element_of_loyalty> Elmo <3
[2:33:27] <%Idziman> Pat, that was amazing, dude
[2:33:29] <agustorm123> Explore green path LUL
[2:33:30] <%Trekalone> I'm pretty sure you did though
[2:33:32] <%spacekataz18> If that's the place I'm thinking of fuck that place
[2:33:34] <+TeethMuncher> @Borealum_EX it irritates his gout
[2:33:41] <GodlyLuigi> the move you need for that spike pit is in the mines methinks
[2:33:49] <Pyr0_Fr0st> Al this back seating you’d think this was a bus

[2:34:22] <johnny2by4x6> Pat has the Tram Pass right?
[2:34:32] <Donchalant402> @SatansDick1 he is actively avoiding all hard progress now just to spite all of us

[2:35:08] <DXLelouch24> theres a Dark Souls style bonfire mod for later playthrough
[2:35:17] <+Kawaso> @angriestpat , you are avoiding progress in the game and walking through areas you've already been in out of spite, would you really have avoided crystal peak if chat wasn't here?
[2:35:21] <DXLelouch24> stats and all
[2:35:23] <Borealum_EX> I came here thinking I would see pat get hype for the sick ass shit in this game but all I see is backtracking and the ocasional new charm still enjoying it though
[2:35:25] <asbestosflavored> time stop
[2:35:30] <+TeethMuncher> @MoonMaidenMinerva in his own way, yes
[2:35:31] <Them00n> Oh Pat, you stupid stupid man.

[2:35:45] <BakerBrute> Chat sucks. let pat do his thing. I want to honest pat experience
[2:35:45] <+TeethMuncher> That's what the markers are for though
[2:35:45] <element_of_loyalty> MaxLOL

[2:56:05] <Borealum_EX> pat progressing in this game is akin to berserk having new chapters dear god
[2:56:07] <element_of_loyalty> Pat gave birth

[2:56:15] <+Dimfish> i cant want for him to take the tram
[2:56:19] <KruelDestiny> He shit himself BibleThump
[2:56:23] <%cervidaequus> Pats water broke
[2:56:24] <%stigna1> Ok, now that Pat is gone, we should talk about the Zubaz in this game as we can do so without spoiling him.
[2:56:28] <%cervidaequus> time for THE BABY
[2:56:30] <danknugglit> Aww man did i miss that nerd shit his pants
[2:56:31] <+Dimfish> the deepnest tram
[2:56:33] <Rellim80> 5 minutes? That means it's a poop and shower.
[2:56:38] <zal_silverfang> so guess. since he is gone. what is everyone hype for pat seeing?
[2:56:39] <DXLelouch24> HORNET DLC WILL BE FREE
[2:56:46] <DXLelouch24> just read in an interview
[2:56:47] <+TeethMuncher> @Borealum_EX what coincidence, Berserk is coming off Hiatus
[2:56:50] <%ultrachibi> does anyone have tips for beating the mantis lords?
[2:56:53] <%unclekulikov> i watch for the smooth jams
[2:56:58] <%PatNTheHat> I have a friend that insists on still doing that middle school thing where you call "safety" after you ass blast, so I legit thought Pat shit himself when he said it
[2:57:00] <%stigna1> We gotta tell him about it when the time comes, right? Its super hidden and no sane persosn could even find it without being told about it. That means its on us, right? Or is that too much backseating?
[2:57:00] <%ultrachibi> particularly in phase 2
[2:57:06] <+gantz_zero> @DXLelouch24 isn't this month's dlc the last one tho. they literally said "Final"
[2:57:12] <Borealum_EX> @TeethMuncher NANI? when?
[2:57:14] <+Dimfish> @zal_silverfang just because the streams off doesnt mean he isnt still reading the chat
[2:57:25] <MrMexicansPinataAdventure> As Hornet would say, gut gud. Learn how to dodge before you try to attack.
[2:57:29] <%Sovspot> apatBig piss
[2:57:37] <zal_silverfang> never said we stop talking using timestop
[2:57:38] <+gantz_zero> @Dimfish that's prob the joke
[2:57:42] <%cervidaequus> @dimfish he needs both hands to hold the toilet paper, no phone
[2:57:43] <DXLelouch24> since when does final mean final
[2:57:45] <+TeethMuncher> @Borealum_EX the 24th
[2:57:49] <+Dimfish> @ultrachibi use the charged slash given to you by the nail master in greenpath
[2:57:58] <$magikestral> timestop is such a good meme btw, I'm glad we picked it up here
[2:58:03] <%stigna1> Right?
[2:58:05] <Borealum_EX> also how was woolie capable of finishing hollow knight with his more than abysmal sense of direction?
[2:58:12] <rhus> Isn’t there also supposed to be Hornet DLC?
[2:58:17] <DXLelouch24> yep
[2:58:29] <KruelDestiny> @ultrachibi worry about dodging than attacking
[2:58:31] <DXLelouch24> but im not waiting till then starting this the 23rd again
[2:58:32] <danknugglit> pat will never live down timestop
[2:58:35] <%stigna1> Its not like you've gotta do it quicky or anything. And it did take woolie ages to do it. Sounds like he never did dream warriors stuff and thus never got the Dreamgate.
[2:58:43] <$magikestral> @rhus i want to say it'll be paid dlc after godmaster
[2:58:45] <%stigna1> Well, until late. Whiich slowed things dooown.
[2:58:47] <+Dimfish> also dodge in a figure 8 pattern for mantis lords
[2:58:54] <%Dani_el_Dani> @danknugglit noone will
[2:58:55] <DXLelouch24> an interview said its free so well see
[2:58:58] <%ultrachibi> thanks guys!
[2:59:05] <@SSaryn> https://clips.twitch.tv/CrypticFantasticShrimpCeilingCat For anyone who didn't see.
[2:59:06] <$magikestral> @stigna1 he got dreamgate very, very late he said
[2:59:08] <+TeethMuncher> @stigna1 I think he implied he got the dreamgate on the last podcast
[2:59:09] <MrMexicansPinataAdventure> I can't wait until Pat sees the watcher knights

He witnessed Peter being bitten by the radioactive spider, and his subsequent displays of superhuman abilities. Eager to get the same powers, Carl located and ate the now dead spider, which gradually caused his body to break down into a Hive Mind of spiders, something he discovered when he unintentionally consumed his own mother from the Inside Out, and took control of her remains.["

[3:12:03] <$GohanEgret> PORTAL DOS
[3:12:04] <+SvenHolgersson> RICH BABY HANDS
[3:12:04] <frozenottsel> Sounds like Pat is about to buy the new NVIDIA RTX2080
[3:12:05] <element_of_loyalty> PORTAL 2
[3:12:07] <ape_hawk> no, but the real portal starts here
[3:12:08] <AncelDeLambert> LUL
[3:12:09] <+Grayhammatter> when's paige playing portal 2? @AngriestPat
[3:12:09] <%stigna1> Portal: Second Gig!
[3:12:10] <element_of_loyalty> she dance
[3:12:12] <%rdark_ksu> @AngriestPat your smaller hands mean your fist is denser aka hit harder. Optimism
[3:12:18] <%ssjklyco> That's twice now that paige called during stream and Pat got alot of money.
[3:12:21] <joblessbone> why do we enable paige
[3:12:25] <%ArcanumMBD> You need timestop to get the timestop
[3:12:26] <%Trekalone> he meant portal 2, he was just holding shift
[3:12:27] <+LordLicoriceThe3rd> you are so close to a time stop pat
[3:12:27] <%Urgotfantasy> I think that guy meant portal 2 LUL
[3:12:31] <+vixenpunch> SHES GETTING MCDONALDS RIGHT NOW
[3:12:32] <+Schir> those fucking mcdonalds delivery men take the toys out of the happy meals it's fraud
[3:12:33] <+gantz_zero> Baby hands...............job
[3:12:35] <+vixenpunch> WATCH OUG
[3:12:36] <Rostichenburg> You keep backing down from time stips
[3:12:36] <SatansDick1> because you wont go to the places we tell you you bumble fuck
[3:12:37] <%xemnahort> that's because you refuse to get any TIME STOP
[3:12:40] <Dakuu75> is it not actualy time-stop? lol
[3:12:41] <+JavaManJoJo> what's gonna happen when it's actually timestop?
[3:12:42] <+redanimator> how bout the neogaf outing all the former dirt on game jurno's
[3:12:44] <danknugglit> Pat can finally buy that $500 space hat
[3:12:46] <+Dimfish> but when he gets the actual time stop its gonna be real awkward
[3:12:46] <Donchalant402> death's gambit is fun
[3:12:47] <AncelDeLambert> does time stop just mean new power now?
[3:12:50] <$SGrim> @rdark_ksu size doesn't denote density. It's likely that his hands are mostly flab due to his high sugar diet. rooShrug
[3:12:50] <Donchalant402> beat it yesterday
[3:12:51] <zamzoph> @AngriestPat I meant Portal 2 but was holding shift BibleThump
[3:12:51] <$magikestral> its never timestop @dakuu75
[3:12:52] <Donchalant402> gud game
[3:12:52] <aeonicvector> only problem is what if timestop is REALLY timestop?
[3:12:53] <element_of_loyalty> Peach is gonna shit when she see's $500.00 donation :D
[3:12:53] <ryu1299> What's time stop mean?
[3:12:55] <%stigna1> @AncelDeLambert Yeee
[3:12:57] <xeros720> make sure you have plenty of time, that intro is long
[3:12:59] <aeonicvector> biggest tip, use the maid
[3:13:02] <Mashdpotaters> Is the stream finishing up
[3:13:02] <%stigna1> TIme stop is code for a powerup you don't have yet.
[3:13:06] <%ArcanumMBD> Death's Gambit is super fucking jank and buggy but still really fun. It has DS1 levels of obscure side shit
[3:13:11] <$magikestral> timestop is a meme from god of war, its been carried over here
[3:13:11] <DXLelouch24> Timestop isnt in this game so its a safe spoiler word
[3:13:12] <talfurt> You & Paige gonna play portal 2 co-op?
[3:13:15] <%ssjklyco> Finish the dungeon in one night
[3:13:18] <ryu1299> thanks
[3:13:19] <element_of_loyalty> YAY
[3:13:21] <%BioApple> calling cards are heavy, they take a lot out of you
[3:13:24] <%xemnahort> @Dakuu75 think of TIME STOP as REDACTED
[3:13:26] <element_of_loyalty> slack
[3:13:28] <%ssjklyco> Max Kawakami
[3:13:28] <%rdark_ksu> @SGrim im trying to be optimistic here man dont go all real on me apatBig
[3:13:31] <SatansDick1> if you want to do the all the social links you chihaya
[3:13:35] <danknugglit> Timestop code for stopping time
[3:13:37] <+Grayhammatter> max kawakami
[3:13:42] <$GohanEgret> plural
[3:13:44] <+NWR_James> also bang out all the waifus
[3:13:46] <zaiwolfgang> max yoshida
[3:13:47] <aeonicvector> i know no time stip in THIS game, but what about if he plays La Mulana or some shit
[3:13:47] <%Agami23> max the sun social link.

[3:13:49] <+Schir> max takemi
[3:13:50] <Arweynn> Also level Death Early, gives mp regen
[3:13:51] <$SGrim> @rdark_ksu I bring the depression. It's my mode of expression. rooCry
[3:13:51] <%stigna1> Time stop comes from the God of War LP, where they kept being blind in puzzles and was like "I bet we need TIME STOP to get through this."
[3:13:54] <ape_hawk> oh no its a virus
[3:13:56] <Daniel_Is_I> I always did them ASAP so I had like 2-3 weeks afterward of relaxation.
[3:13:59] <zaiwolfgang> TIME FOR POLITICS
[3:14:00] <Nobrev> I always do the dungeon on the first day and send the card on the last possible day
[3:14:01] <element_of_loyalty> 1050 minus 929
[3:14:02] <%stigna1> BIG_PORNZ.EXE
[3:14:04] <SeventyForce> Oh that one with that spider girl
[3:14:05] <pebblypirate> Oh cliffside is pretty good
[3:14:07] <aeonicvector> whats our plan B codeword incase timestop ACTUALLY exists
[3:14:13] <+vixenpunch> Fuck yeah cliffside
[3:14:14] <+redanimator> quiet man interview said they are baseing combat off yakuza series
[3:14:14] <%rdark_ksu> @SGrim same. I'm only optimistic for others
[3:14:15] <zaiwolfgang> timestop
[3:14:18] <danknugglit> Weird porn
[3:14:20] <zaiwolfgang> the sequal
[3:14:21] <+Dimfish> time moveforwarder
[3:14:24] <%stigna1> @aeonicvector Time stop! Its a meme, so even if it exists no-one will expect it to exist!
[3:14:25] <SatansDick1> @aeonicvector time stop
[3:14:27] <zaiwolfgang> Timestart
[3:14:31] <KruelDestiny> M A S S I V E dongs?
[3:14:41] <dekkitout> giant magnum dongs!
[3:14:44] <%stigna1> And if we were to change it that would be a spoiler in of itself, as that would imply the existance of time stop.
[3:14:52] <+Dimfish> @zaiwolfgang i dont know why i didnt just say time start
[3:15:01] <%xemnahort> @Nobrev the only reason I don't do that is because many times party members hang out less if dungeon isn't finished
[3:15:03] <SatansDick1> hey when did pat become a rakghoul
[3:15:06] <AtlasMcCoy> Yo if we talkin cartoon pilots yall should check out Song in the Sky.
[3:15:08] <Donchalant402> dont forget that charm

[3:15:09] <%stigna1> WOW!
[3:15:11] <%ArcanumMBD> No spend more time in dirtmouth
[3:15:13] <+vixenpunch> Wait, if timestop is the thing pat wishes for the most does that mean that crazy talk requiem gives him time stop only when he doesn’t want time to be stopped?
[3:15:15] <danknugglit> Waow

[3:15:54] <KruelDestiny> monkaS

[3:15:54] <+gwanzan> don't self-swat, bro
[3:15:55] <ape_hawk> this whole stream is an emergency
[3:15:55] <%stigna1> "Hello, this is 911" "I'm a shitass."
[3:15:56] <%HanPaul> Hey Pat, hyped for september 6th?
[3:15:56] <xeros720> Elmo could've called 911

[3:15:58] <aeonicvector> you mean the 90210?
[3:16:04] <Rngiddion> that would be a fun addition to the stream, and a great podcast conversation
[3:16:05] <zettig> What's Canadian for 911?
[3:16:06] <+LordLicoriceThe3rd> maybe they would like to come and watch
[3:16:08] <element_of_loyalty> 119
[3:16:08] <legoaisu> Pat woulda lost that 500 real quick
[3:16:09] <+capnbeeb> I think you mean 912
[3:16:11] <$magikestral> "come quick he stole a poor boy's 500 bucks"
[3:16:11] <DraxTD> oh man pat, cops come bust down your door

[3:16:32] <Donchalant402> there you go
[3:16:36] <%stigna1> Is Greenpath gonna become a meme? I want it to.
[3:16:36] <element_of_loyalty> Pat your ass is calling the cops
[3:16:40] <+Leroytirebiter> don't forget about the bank
[3:16:46] <Donchalant402> @AngriestPat you could have pogo'd on the spikes to get it
[3:16:50] <+JavaManJoJo> you can pogo to it at the start
[3:16:52] <+mariomixedup> "Yes 911? Yes Pat keeps dying to spikes plz send help!"
[3:16:52] <%stigna1> Aww, its so motivational. :)
[3:16:54] <AtlasMcCoy> MON STAR
[3:16:56] <crimsonharvest> "higher being" is the player
[3:16:57] <%ArcanumMBD> FURY
[3:17:00] <+JustToWatch> "911, what's you're emergency" pat went to deepnest before crystal peak "please hold on sir, we're sending in a swat team"
[3:17:03] <%mattmanj17> @AngriestPat go put my bug money in the bug bank
[3:17:06] <element_of_loyalty> FURRY?
[3:17:14] <%xemnahort> oh that one kind of sucks
[3:17:19] <SatansDick1> in greenpath there is a area that needed the lantern @AngriestPat
[3:17:22] <$magikestral> bug bank time?
[3:17:27] <+Leroytirebiter> RTSR
[3:17:29] <Kghaleon> You can bounce on the spikes, and get this right at the start of the game.
[3:17:31] <+Grayhammatter> furry of the fallen
[3:17:35] <%stigna1> What's everyone's fav line in this game (no spoils)? Mine is "“Be the person you’d like to meet. If our lives are but a spark in the eye of gods, then let us blind them at least once”"
[3:17:38] <Rostichenburg> Fight the boss in crossroads
[3:17:46] <+Dimfish> fury of the fallen is useful for bosses
[3:17:47] <+Jokylvl> What up pat
[3:17:48] <AtlasMcCoy> same
[3:17:57] <Pairoschuz> Red tearstone ring
[3:17:57] <aeonicvector> useful to clutch out a win
[3:17:57] <Donchalant402> its useful if you're BAD at bosses
[3:17:58] <+Leroytirebiter> you don't like the RTSR? it's great
[3:18:06] <Borealum_EX> it's a red tearstone ring basically
[3:18:06] <zaiwolfgang> bank?
[3:18:12] <%ArcanumMBD> fury of the fallen is peak speedrun strat that is never used because it's waaayy too risky
[3:18:13] <%Agami23> does fury of the fallen count lifeblood as HP?
[3:18:17] <+Dimfish> well at least its upped his charm count so he can buy more notches
[3:18:17] <pebblypirate> left
[3:18:20] <element_of_loyalty> DRINK
[3:18:21] <Donchalant402> I hate any charm like this of grubsong because it its only useful if you're being shit
[3:18:25] <%Agami23> because if not, you could use that and the blessing charm to make a super powerful combo
[3:18:29] <%Metal_Slime_King> North West
[3:18:30] <Donchalant402> no
[3:18:31] <$magikestral> up into fog canyon to the left

[3:18:40] <element_of_loyalty> HEY PAIGE
[3:18:40] <+Dimfish> nope
[3:18:41] <%xemnahort> lore only
[3:18:42] <$magikestral> no, the bank is in fog canyon
[3:18:42] <+TeethMuncher> It's in fog canyon
[3:18:44] <$Tredecian> up and left
[3:18:44] <element_of_loyalty> SO SEXY
[3:18:44] <pebblypirate> more left
[3:18:46] <+JustToWatch> no, up and left
[3:18:46] <leole11> further to the left
[3:18:52] <%ArcanumMBD> @Donchalant402 nah fury of the fallen isn't good if you're shit, it's good if you're amazing because you deliberately put yourself to 1hp to use it. Like red tearstone ring in DS
[3:18:53] <cerberuscarmine> HAWT
[3:18:54] <+edited156> I fell asleep to Pat's melodic voice. Did he ever figure out overcharming
[3:18:59] <+SvenHolgersson> Is this Anor Londo?
[3:18:59] <Dakuu75> I think that was the LEAST hostile looking character int he game so far

[3:19:04] <%stigna1> @Donchalant402 Grubsong is sweet! Its hyper efficient, and lets you channel your hurt into bonus damage if you need to. Plus, it works with weaversong for extra energy and even lets you heal off of spikes. Plus, infinite healing with Hiveblood.

[3:27:09] <pebblypirate> the journal

[3:27:30] <element_of_loyalty> Pat needs a towel
[3:27:30] <%stigna1> @ArcanumMBD I posted it in the chat a while back. I'll do so again;
[3:27:32] <+LordLicoriceThe3rd> Pat; things to do, Journal for maggot bros, visit banker again
[3:27:34] <+gantz_zero> are you glad or mad woolie didn't get you to play sooner @AngriestPat
[3:27:35] <+Gorgodrn> That's what I say every time I play it.
[3:27:36] <leole11> @DXLelouch24 he bought everything, he grinded offscreen
[3:27:36] <%stigna1> Maggot: Weakest member of the kingdom of Hallownest. Generally looked down upon and forced to do menial labour. Consisting of mainly sweet fat, these helpless creatures make excellent provisions for long journeys. Best roasted over an open flame. If they try to bargain for their life, just ignore them. They have nothing to offer.
[3:27:41] <Reanimator83> How many Redbulls has pat had already?
[3:27:41] <$magikestral> I can't wait for the podcast
[3:27:43] <%uhBriefcase> check out those maggots

[3:29:00] <danknugglit> Talk shit get hit
[3:29:10] <%stigna1> Zote's Precept Twenty-Four: Strike the Foes Weak Point. Once you have identified your foes weak point as per the previous precept, strike it. This will instantly destroy them.
[3:29:18] <%xxviios> Daaang still goin
[3:29:24] <%stigna1> Zote's Precept Twenty-Five: Protect Your Own Weak Point. Be aware that your foe will try to identify your weak point, so you must protect it. The best protection? Never having a weak point in the first place.
[3:29:38] <ty2000sk> just watched that animated thing "cliffside" It was really funny.
[3:29:38] <%ArcanumMBD> @AngriestPat Don't forget you have a Nail Art now

[3:29:51] <element_of_loyalty> wings
[3:29:57] <+Camail> we was a mini boss
[3:30:01] <leole11> actually, greenpath has the other piece you need, pat
[3:30:02] <%xemnahort> read his hunter entry
[3:30:03] <AtlasMcCoy> So what level is pat's nail at btw?
[3:30:05] <Rostichenburg> should’ve done it earlier
[3:30:07] <+Dimfish> hes not a major boss
[3:30:10] <danknugglit> That looked like wings
[3:30:10] <%skizzuto> he's upgraded it once
[3:30:22] <Rostichenburg> crystal peak for more shops
[3:30:23] <element_of_loyalty> Lance
[3:30:23] <+Camail> dank pale ore
[3:30:26] <Bonobonobone> man I want to get back into this but I'd be so fucking lost
[3:30:27] <asbestosflavored> you thought your were too week b4 but you didn't read any moves
[3:30:29] <%xxviios> Virtue is its own reward, Pat
[3:30:29] <AtlasMcCoy> I forget where I found them
[3:30:29] <$magikestral> i want to say its 6 damage now? been a while
[3:30:33] <%stigna1> Looks like Pat...nailed that boss! apatDab apatDab
[3:30:33] <%xemnahort> hunter entry @AngriestPat
[3:30:35] <Donchalant402> @AngriestPat when going on boss runs I'd high recommend replacing your compass with Steady Body
[3:30:43] <pebblypirate> crystal peak is pretty important
[3:30:46] <DXLelouch24> Crystal Peak for shops so you can withdraw from the bank for dialogue
[3:30:49] <%korth367> @stigna1 fuck outta here
[3:30:52] <zal_silverfang> shouldnt ge have access to some pale or by now? or is this game longer then i remember
[3:30:57] <%stigna1> Here's the journal entry for the boss!
[3:31:01] <%stigna1> Brooding Mawlek: Ferocious but extremely social creature. Becomes aggressive if not able to mingle with its own kind. I hear this beast crying out sometimes as I prowl the caverns, although I've never actually laid eyes on it. Who or what is it calling for? As far as I can tell, its voice is never answered.
[3:31:06] <Rostichenburg> he can get a couple of pale ores now
[3:31:08] <Donchalant402> @zal_silverfang there is WAY more left
[3:31:15] <AtlasMcCoy> I think he should, you find it by exploring so he might have missed it by not being super thorough
[3:31:19] <%stigna1> Also, <3 Korth.
[3:31:21] <+vixenpunch> Mr president, we are exporting bug porn at an exceedingly high rate!
[3:31:33] <zal_silverfang> meant more in the context of upgrade and ability spread through the world
[3:31:34] <+Dimfish> he could get some but theres one thats easy to get after finishing crystal peak
[3:31:34] <%xemnahort> @stigna1 I know the entry but I want pat to read it and feel sad
[3:31:35] <DXLelouch24> you didnt
[3:31:37] <$Mendin> I think he needs timestop for the accessible one he could get
[3:31:44] <Rostichenburg> keep going up here pat breakable roof
[3:31:46] <+Dimfish> or he could ride the tram for BIG FUN
[3:31:50] <Donchalant402> @AngriestPat his the ceiling to the right of the grubs

[3:34:01] <Rostichenburg> ride the deep nest tram for no progress
[3:34:01] <$Mendin> Crystal Peak is both progress and A New Shop Inventory
[3:34:01] <$magikestral> @angriestpat everywhere you look is progress, especially the trams
[3:34:03] <+Kawaso> you have to play a different game for time stop progress.
[3:34:05] <SparkplaysPC> I mean, you're running out of "not progress" ways at this point LUL
[3:34:07] <+Gorgodrn> I mean, the game is going to indirectly force you back to the peak regardless. LUL
[3:34:12] <%umbypokochan> oh god please no spider elmo fanart o.o
[3:34:13] <+Grayhammatter> three whole elmos, screaming incessantly at you

[3:36:09] <Donchalant402> isnt the good shit to the right
[3:36:14] <Rostichenburg> pat you can turn off the crushers
[3:36:14] <%stigna1> Zote's Precept Forty-Six: The World is Smaller Than You Think. When young, you tend to think that the world is vast, huge, gigantic. Its only natural. Unfortunately, its actually quite a lot smaller than that. I can say this, now having travelled everywhere in the land.
[3:36:17] <johnny2by4x6> Pat you can reflect their pickaxes
[3:36:20] <element_of_loyalty> JUST DO IT YOU WHIMP
[3:36:32] <johnny2by4x6> Yes

[3:36:44] <$magikestral> just dash when hugging wall
[3:36:56] <%xemnahort> @xxviios honestly I'm not sure he was considering he seemed to actually forget he had a compass
[3:36:59] <+Leroytirebiter> you can reflect most of the non magic projectiles, if not all of them
[3:37:00] <$shadow1man9> @AngriestPat You can kill the laser dudes with magic
[3:37:02] <SatansDick1> magic hurts laser bugs
[3:37:05] <pebblypirate> it was always really weird to me that the first ability you get in this game isnt the traditional double jump and instead you get a wallclimb
[3:37:05] <Rostichenburg> break the wall
[3:37:06] <SparkplaysPC> You can also reflect the spikes crystal bugs shoot
[3:37:07] <$Tredecian> wall secret
[3:37:09] <Donchalant402> @AngriestPat you can use magic on the laser guys
[3:37:10] <AtlasMcCoy> WAIT I DIDNT KNOW THAT

These creatures look weak, but sometimes a burning pillar of heat will burst out from the crystals they carry on their backs. Be wary, and time your strike well.
[3:37:23] <DXLelouch24> plus DLC
[3:37:25] <Rostichenburg> tear down that wall
[3:37:30] <DXLelouch24> and even more DLC incoming

[3:38:37] <asbestosflavored> rip
[3:38:37] <%stigna1> Crystalized Husk: Bestiary Remains of a bug who died amongst the crystals. Animated by a strange force, it attacks by firing beams of light from its crystallised arms. The is some strange power hidden in the crystals that grow up there in the peaks. They gleam and glow in the darkness, a bright point of searing heat in each one. They sing too, if you listen. Very softly...

The bugs of Hallownest lusted after the strangest things in life. They would dig furtively through the dirt for stone, ore and in particular the crystals that grow at the top of the world.

[4:13:30] <+Dimfish> yes so they basically have zero cost now
[4:13:32] <dandyspider> yes
[4:13:32] <%stigna1> @AngriestPat Which then gets flipped into making more swarmers.
[4:13:32] <%BioApple> Elder Elmo requires the loops, brother
[4:13:35] <+vixenpunch> When weavers hit they give soul
[4:13:36] <%Agami23> when the spiders damage enemies you gain soul

[4:29:15] <%stigna1> @Dakuu75 YOu mostly can't upgrade, but you can convert the fragile ones to unbreaking.
[4:29:17] <AtlasMcCoy> @Dakuu75 But some charms interact with each other to boost them
[4:29:22] <%xemnahort> @Dakuu75 most are static but 5 aren't
[4:29:27] <SatansDick1> i think it synergises with his build

[4:30:55] <%stigna1> Fun fact about the dive spell; it gives you a BUNCH of Iframes, so you can drop it on dudes and then walk out of them.

[4:31:20] <%bootysteve> I'm livid

[4:31:26] <+vixenpunch> Yes

[4:31:59] <$Mendin> Shush
[4:32:00] <+gantz_zero> @SneakyPenguin77 he has a fucking simple key
[4:32:00] <+Camail> can we chill for a sec, chat

[4:32:10] <@thenefftw> @SneakyPenguin77 Calm the fuck down
[4:32:16] <element_of_loyalty> Lucky Ted beats Hollow Knight
[4:32:31] <+hawk_rush> eh, this area wasn't that hard
[4:32:37] <+hawk_rush> deepnest is harder
[4:32:40] <+Camail> caps are reserved for hype moments, like when we fucked him out of his money
[4:32:48] <$magikestral> the boss was annoying but i don't think i ever found him hard
[4:32:48] <tyrano191> For lore read journal entries on the bosses
[4:32:49] <@SSaryn> If Pat does ask for help, he will, don't worry. Calm the hell down.
[4:32:50] <%bootysteve> Pat and his army
[4:32:51] <+Camail> that was a fun time
[4:32:59] <SparkplaysPC> Man, I never used these charms, would've helped in late game LUL
[4:33:04] <+vixenpunch> @hawk_rush idk if you were here but he beat almost all of deepnest
[4:33:04] <asbestosflavored> LUL
[4:33:06] <$Mendin> He's already gotten 1.4k from soul sanctuary he's fine with his other deposit "collecting interest"
[4:33:08] <pebblypirate> dig up stupid
[4:33:11] <%stigna1> @tyrano191 If you're interesteed, I've been posting them as Pat kills the relivant foes.
[4:33:13] <%Littleredz98> The music in this area is so fucking good
[4:33:13] <+Camail> this game is pretty boring when you use minions
[4:33:18] <$magikestral> elmo hole
[4:33:19] <alcors_wisdom> imagine being the kind of person who gets lost in a 2 door room
[4:33:19] <KruelDestiny> @bootysteve :(
[4:33:21] <+Dimfish> just use the route you came in to get back to the city
[4:33:25] <BakerBrute> Chat never forget you helped create a future where Pat doesn't have to play hollow knight
[4:33:26] <tyrano191> Cool
[4:33:27] <HunterMGlengi> soul sanctum's kind of a culdesac, not very elegant in its exit
[4:33:34] <asbestosflavored> minions cant read maps Kappa
[4:33:36] <$magikestral> go down through the hole in that big room then down the elmo hole
[4:33:40] <ivangood2> dig up stupid
[4:33:40] <+hawk_rush> @vixenpunch nah, I came like halfway through the stream. Gotta check that out tomorrow in the VOD
[4:33:45] <%xemnahort> @AngriestPat there is one good thing about the bank, its collecting interest.
[4:33:58] <TheEdrem> TIMESTOP
[4:33:59] <$magikestral> you forgot about the hole in the floor
[4:33:59] <%stigna1> Notice the corpse is still here!
[4:34:01] <+vixenpunch> Guys let pat enjoy himself, he absolutely loves minmaxing and pet build won’t last him forever
[4:34:04] <Rostichenburg> remember this corpse pat
[4:34:05] <+TeethMuncher> Burning Gears
[4:34:05] <alcors_wisdom> you walked through the exit and turned around pat how
[4:34:08] <+gantz_zero> @xemnahort or he could discover that on his own, y'know
[4:34:09] <+Bupkis7> Again, FUCK YOU
[4:34:15] <alcors_wisdom> down right up
[4:34:15] <HunterMGlengi> just go back to the entrance pat haha

[4:34:17] <@thenefftw> If Pat's getting lost here, Paige would have no chance playing this
[4:34:21] <NerevaRising> you were going the right way before backing up
[4:34:25] <alcors_wisdom> go all the way right go up and then keep going right
[4:34:27] <%cirdrag> get the airhorn!

[4:34:31] <SatansDick1> you keep going in a circle pat
[4:34:35] <AzirothTheGreat> down to right etc
[4:34:40] <AtlasMcCoy> Paige's hollow knight playthrough would take a year
[4:34:42] <The_UnfathoMarble> He's farming money
[4:34:46] <%xemnahort> @gantz_zero well we were a little mean so I wanted to give him hope if he noticed me
[4:34:47] <joblessbone> gentle guidance is fine
[4:34:53] <Kaneis> @thenefftw I think this game is too long for her schedule anyway
[4:34:56] <alcors_wisdom> pat you need to go east
[4:35:04] <alcors_wisdom> or starboard
[4:35:08] <dan_g_v> But we need more antiprogression

[4:35:20] <+gantz_zero> @xemnahort wouldn't that just make the realization better? he's super aware of exactly how much he should be getting back

[4:35:35] <RedPlasticCup> lol
[4:35:39] <MattDemers> Dear @AngriestPat, I told you City of Tears was the best zone in the game
[4:35:45] <Kaneis> @stigna1 I think Portal is pretty short no? Despite her forgetting she has a gun, she did really well near the end
[4:35:45] <+Dimfish> im so upset at him
[4:35:45] <AzirothTheGreat> now find the lock
[4:35:50] <+SparkAfterDark> It took more time and effort to walk out of that area than it did to beat it
[4:35:51] <%bootysteve> City of Tears has the best music imo
[4:35:54] <%bootysteve> plus the rain sfx over it
[4:35:55] <$Mendin> He doesn't even need his money anymore, that place was loaded
[4:35:59] <+Dimfish> how could he just stroll through there like that
[4:36:02] <RedPlasticCup> love how pats just rollin around with his squad all like "we dem boys" effortlessly killing everything and then hes like "that was rough"
[4:36:02] <$magikestral> i Believe you can get to the east side of town with crystal dash
[4:36:03] <%xemnahort> @gantz_zero its a moot point anyway since he didn't notice
[4:36:06] <%stigna1> Zote's Precept Fifty-Three: Do Not Steal the Desires of Others. Every creature keeps their desires locked up inside of themselves. If you catch a glimpse of anothers desires, resist the urge to claim them as your own. It will not lead you to happiness.
[4:36:08] <+hawk_rush> doesn't pat need another timestop to get his money back?
[4:36:14] <Rostichenburg> @angriestpat you need to take the deep nest tram if you want your money back timely

[4:42:12] <%stigna1> @Metal_Slime_King He does, but Pat isn't really interested in getting money. He's very aescetic like that.
[4:42:15] <+gantz_zero> Heavy Blow is paige's charm

[4:42:47] <+TeethMuncher> @gamerboy385 why do you hate efficiency?
[4:42:48] <Sleepology> he didnt go to the hotsprings yet right?
[4:42:50] <Rostichenburg> He either needs a second key or go through ancient basin
[4:42:51] <thetechnicalraven> Bonsoir Pat, chat SMOrc
[4:42:52] <ohnogino> the frubs are so fuggin cute

[4:43:04] <alcors_wisdom> sit on the bench for a bit pat
[4:43:06] <%stigna1> Hey, @SSaryn, if you don't mind I've been wondering where you got your name from? Is it the warframe, the war-crime gas or something else?
[4:43:06] <+Gorgen> S-Senpai!
[4:43:12] <+Camail> has he visited nerd girls room yet
[4:43:14] <joblessbone> he saw blush already

[4:43:18] <Heyestus> They might be helpless and sound like they belong on the short bus but those grub guys are alright.
[4:43:19] <$magikestral> he's going to elegant room first, i THINK he can go to the east side of town with the dash
[4:43:20] <johnny2by4x6> Tram time
[4:43:20] <@SSaryn> Specifically.
[4:43:26] <%stigna1> Awesome! Thanks for your time. ^_^
[4:43:29] <+SparkAfterDark> Why is everyone hating on winions build? It's not like we're here to see Pat be GOOD at games and this means he'll actually be making progress even faster
[4:43:29] <thetechnicalraven> Even Skellmo back there is having an aneurysm
[4:43:30] <%Divryne> TRAM.
[4:43:31] <@SSaryn> Mainly also because I thought the context and the name was pretty cool.
[4:43:33] <+LegendaryButcher> use that tram please
[4:43:34] <%Divryne> RAM THAT TRAM.
[4:43:37] <ivangood2> take the tram now
[4:43:38] <leole11> you should cross the chasm in crystal peak
[4:43:41] <bambowl> pat has 6 kids and bench bug still wants him
[4:43:43] <Parapattern> TRAM MART
[4:43:43] <+vixenpunch> HEY PAT GO DOWN THAT HOLE
[4:43:44] <+gamerboy385> @teethmuncher Its streamer poison. i dont want to watch him blow through the game using a build that makes everything a cakewalk.
[4:43:48] <+vixenpunch> IN CRYSTAL PEAL
[4:43:50] <Donchalant402> the two tram areas have really good gets behind them
[4:43:50] <+vixenpunch> PEAK
[4:43:50] <%BioApple> @SparkAfterDark we're here to see him get ruckused by bosses
[4:43:52] <+gantz_zero> big booty flower lady @SSaryn ;D
[4:44:00] <extradopeness> YEET
[4:44:02] <Kaneis> Skrrrrrt
[4:44:03] <%stigna1> @SparkAfterDark To be fair, Pat does actualaly seem to be pretty good at this game. Combat anyway.
[4:44:04] <EMP_Ike_Turner> is tram mart across the street from gross mart
[4:44:06] <+TeethMuncher> @gamerboy385 well that's Pat for ya
[4:44:26] <$shadow1man9> @AngriestPat There's a breakable wall in the room above this one I believe
[4:44:27] <asbestosflavored> miner girl PogChamp
[4:44:30] <+gantz_zero> wow as he's flying, he's just shitting out winions
[4:44:37] <$magikestral> tram and the crystal peak area lead to the same place, so this is better thematically
[4:44:43] <Rostichenburg> break that wall pt
[4:44:43] <pebblypirate> magic the crystal bugs
[4:44:46] <thetechnicalraven> This wouldn't be a problem were this in the West Coast, would it Pat? Kappa
[4:44:47] <AtlasMcCoy> WOAH
[4:44:48] <+MetaSla> PogCham[p

[4:44:58] <SparkplaysPC> Ye, Pat's actually really good at this game
[4:45:04] <AtlasMcCoy> LUL
[4:45:15] <%BioApple> @SparkplaysPC you just got crazy talk'd
[4:45:17] <%rdark_ksu> is dificil
[4:45:19] <BlitzChocula> you can't just jam it in there, ya gotta time it, man.
[4:45:19] <asbestosflavored> LUL
[4:45:22] <+gamerboy385> @camail Platforming is only part of the game
[4:45:24] <SparkplaysPC> Except for when he's not LUL
[4:45:27] <thetechnicalraven> Is Pat ever good at games? LUL
[4:45:28] <HunterMGlengi> love the bugs trying to beat up those lasers
[4:45:30] <+gantz_zero> lmao
[4:45:30] <SparkplaysPC> I guess I did LUL
[4:45:31] <%ssjklyco> Finally, beat Malwak
[4:45:33] <nepwar> LUL
[4:45:35] <EMP_Ike_Turner> LUL

[4:45:40] <Donchalant402> little guys are going crazy, do they could as enemies to them?
[4:45:54] <%DedlokPM> @gamerboy385 Personally I rather watch someone blow through the game than watch them die a hundred times to the same thing. I realize that I am saying this as he repeatedly hits a laser field, but my point still stands
[4:45:58] <Donchalant402> *count
[4:45:59] <%rdark_ksu> oh fuck you!
[4:46:03] <leole11> wong way
[4:46:04] <Sleepology> pat no
[4:46:11] <Kaneis> Lets do it again
[4:46:15] <%xemnahort> @Donchalant402 no its more that they can only idle at benches
[4:46:16] <asbestosflavored> INSTANTLY SPRINT BACK
[4:46:22] <%stigna1> @Donchalant402 Yee; the minions are not really all that clever with target priority. They aggro a lot of things, including the banker-fraud lady.
[4:46:26] <8BitDsx> I agree entirely with @DedlokPM
[4:46:28] <Donchalant402> GOOD SHIT
[4:46:29] <$magikestral> EXTREMELY USEFUL CHARM
[4:46:34] <+vixenpunch> YEYEYEYE
[4:46:35] <%skizzuto> GOOD CHARM
[4:46:41] <+Camail> DOUBLE HEAL
[4:46:42] <cerberuscarmine> HEALING
[4:46:45] <AtlasMcCoy> DOUBLE
[4:46:49] <SatansDick1> good charm for your build
[4:46:51] <dekkitout> heals go up
[4:46:51] <$magikestral> @angriestpat deep focus + quick focus = normal sized charge that heals two
[4:46:51] <leole11> G A M E C H A N G E R
[4:46:52] <Heyestus> charm too fat
[4:46:52] <Fyu_kazuma> deerCup
[4:46:53] <%BioApple> apatBig HEALING, apatBig NOTCH COST
[4:46:54] <+Cigwynn> Healing go up
[4:46:55] <+TeethMuncher> @AngriestPat it stacks with quick focus
[4:46:59] <pebblypirate> but its 4 slots
[4:46:59] <bambowl> thats alotta blimps
[4:47:00] <+AngriestAngryArtist> combine that with the quick focus and ou'll get normal focus time with double heal
[4:47:01] <%xemnahort> grubsong plua deep focus means platforming can't kill you
[4:47:01] <%AbnormalVoid> Double Healix
[4:47:05] <Kaneis> Why when you can have double dps
[4:47:12] <leole11> Go above the bench, pat
[4:47:14] <+gamerboy385> @dedlokpm The darksould remastered VOD of him failing to beat bed of chaos begs to differ
[4:47:15] <+vixenpunch> PAT IF YOU USE BOTH YOU GET NORMAL HEAL SPEED AND DOUBLE PIPS
[4:47:22] <$Mendin> I think he needs another timestop to get that one @leole11
[4:47:35] <+Dimfish> why are we always all yelling in all caps
[4:47:35] <leole11> @Mendin ah shit, you're right
[4:47:44] <BlitzChocula> I mean, who needs double healing if you just don't get hit?
[4:47:48] <thetechnicalraven> How long has Pat been streaming today anyway?
[4:47:49] <%DedlokPM> @gamerboy385 It actually proves my point because I tabbed out of that while I watched it live.
[4:47:49] <joblessbone> so he can hear us?
[4:47:51] <joblessbone> duh
[4:47:54] <%skizzuto> Pat stop face-tanking
[4:47:58] <+TeethMuncher> !uptime
[4:47:58] <+gantz_zero> prob because no one yells in lowercase? @Dimfish
[4:47:58] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 48m .
[4:47:58] <%DedlokPM> during that part
[4:47:58] <%stigna1> @Dimfish I think because its more visable that way; most likely to be seen.
[4:47:59] <Coystick> Is there a muganmonkey character planner sort of thing for Hollow Knight?
[4:48:04] <%xemnahort> @vixenpunch does he even have enough notches right now
[4:48:04] <ivangood2> @Dimfish I'M NOT YELLING
[4:48:09] <%korth367> !uptime
[4:48:11] <ValidVenasaur> RIGHT
[4:48:13] <knomad2b> so i look away for 5 mins and pat has an army of bugs lol
[4:48:13] <thetechnicalraven> @blitzchocula That would require Pat to not get hit LUL
[4:48:13] <leole11> go across the chasm
[4:48:16] <AtlasMcCoy> Where's pat going btw?
[4:48:17] <Rostichenburg> across the chasm
[4:48:22] <+Kawaso> Jesus, hit them and then walk back, you don't have to take damage every time.
[4:48:23] <%rdark_ksu> cheer200 Hey Pat I remember how you said being called "smart" messed you up as as kid. I'm the same and it still sticks with me. How did you get past it?
[4:48:41] <$magikestral> going the wrong way for the bottom chasm i think
[4:48:45] <+gantz_zero> he became a shitty youtuber
[4:48:46] <+SimplyPandaz> Hey pat how do i use the great sword good in mon hun?
[4:48:49] <+skylerpilot> hey pat do the grey mourner quest!

[4:50:21] <+Bupkis7> She went hollow
[4:50:22] <@SSaryn> Might as well delete the game huh.
[4:50:27] <+Dimfish> she hollows out after soul master dies
[4:50:28] <+edited156> Whatever you tell yourself to sleep at night Pat
[4:50:29] <SparkplaysPC> Biocurse got to her
[4:50:37] <DXLelouch24> THIS IS IT I THINK

[4:50:48] <leole11> cross the gap
[4:50:49] <@SSaryn> Is it?
[4:50:53] <@SSaryn> Is it time for TIME STOP
[4:50:53] <alcors_wisdom> he was holding them back
[4:50:54] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> Nope, it just took enough time
[4:50:56] <thetechnicalraven> Another victim of Pat's slaughter of "disgusting civilians"
[4:50:56] <alcors_wisdom> basically kosm
[4:50:58] <JusTTheGuyYouNeed> He was HOLDING IT BACK
[4:50:59] <$magikestral> its time based, not person based
[4:51:04] <%Divryne> Take the tram.
[4:51:05] <SatansDick1> you missed a ton of dialogue
[4:51:10] <+SeroSedLaeto> Not a shortcut, and alternative entrance
[4:51:12] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> It happens after soul master dies but it's not related to him
[4:51:14] <@thenefftw> I can't believe Pat is a big murderer
[4:51:14] <$Tredecian> thats the way most people enter crystal
[4:51:15] <Aleate> Time STOP based? Kappa
[4:51:18] <%mister___doctor> What an easy, easy asshole Soul Master is. no trouble at all to beat
[4:51:18] <Rostichenburg> not time based at all
[4:51:20] <%BioApple> Yeah I killed soul master super late and myla hollowed out at around the same time
[4:51:22] <$magikestral> @angriestpat there's a chasm on the bottom left of crysyal peak that'll get you to the same place as the tram
[4:51:24] <%Divryne> Closest tram first.
[4:51:24] <ivangood2> the one near you
[4:51:26] <+Gohyakuen> elegant key
[4:51:26] <SatansDick1> big hole in crystal peak
[4:51:27] <$magikestral> bottom righr
[4:51:28] <ValidVenasaur> Missed a place in Crystal Peak
[4:51:28] <%xemnahort> @Dimfish really I thought she hollowed out after crystal heart cause you have a heart of crystal and she mines crystal
[4:51:28] <Coystick> iF ONLY YOU HAD time stop YOU could have saved her
[4:51:29] <asbestosflavored> chat is full stupid. they're all lies

[5:02:39] <EMP_Ike_Turner> because sewer level
[5:02:39] <%stigna1> Those worms are called Flukemon: Worm-like creature that prefers damp, dark habitats. Dangerous, unpredictable foes that infest the pipes below Hallownest's capital. Even when it seems you've killed them, you need to stay on guard.
[5:02:40] <+edited156> Pat you're in a sewer

[5:02:58] <%BioApple> it's the sewer used by the guys in your sewer. it's a double sewer

[5:04:36] <Tisaric> It's a gauntlet area
[5:04:37] <Rostichenburg> the fungus is really nice
[5:04:37] <$Tredecian> this is a challenge room
[5:04:37] <DeadBlu3ey3z> are those raindrops or chickens in the background
[5:04:39] <dandyspider> bugs not humans
[5:04:42] <+TeethMuncher> @Sokumotanaka if know Pat, probably half a year from no
[5:04:43] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> forget FFTactics, when is Rocket Knight
[5:04:46] <+gantz_zero> @joblessbone i think it's really awesome but it needs another pass on it's combat. IMO it -will- be awesome with a later patch or something
[5:04:47] <asbestosflavored> sewers have the big stink
[5:04:52] <%BioApple> He's Sindri

[5:08:11] <Dakuu75> oh gawd, water?! is there a water-temple level comming?
[5:08:18] <%stigna1> @joblessbone I don't think so.
[5:08:25] <leole11> this is the water temple, technically
[5:08:34] <$Mendin> This and the City of Tears are pretty much your watery zones
[5:08:37] <Donchalant402> @AngriestPat far right is progress
[5:08:38] <Tisaric> cause that bench had fallen from up where the sign was
[5:08:40] <SparkplaysPC> SFX WutFace
[5:08:45] <+TeethMuncher> @Dakuu75 The body itself could be considered a water temple

[5:13:38] <$Tredecian> change build just for this boss
[5:13:39] <thetechnicalraven> LUL
[5:13:39] <%rdark_ksu> I BELIVE IN YOU
[5:13:40] <Tisaric> yeah this build isn't really good for flukemarm
[5:13:40] <cerberuscarmine> the nam nams got you
[5:13:41] <Dakuu75> O_O
[5:13:41] <%BioApple> I love that even on a weird alien worm boss the SFX is just some person going OWOLOLOWOLOWO
[5:13:41] <nepwar> too much styling and not enough profiling
[5:13:42] <%xemnahort> kills adds let minions kill boss
[5:13:42] <+gantz_zero> prob didn't help that he stood still for like 10 seconds doing nothing
[5:13:44] <Sleepology> spells are good
[5:13:44] <joblessbone> ITS A STARCRAFT CARRIER
[5:13:44] <Donchalant402> @AngriestPat try using the divebomb on it
[5:13:44] <crimsonharvest> This boss made me quit
[5:13:45] <Bonobonobone> ohlohlohlhoholho
[5:13:46] <+TeethMuncher> @AngriestPat it's optional
[5:13:47] <%stigna1> Thank you, kenpachiramasama.
[5:13:48] <+gantz_zero> he could've healed
[5:13:49] <KiraKamixephos> @angriestpat ever gonna visit Dead Cells?
[5:13:50] <+brave_sj> Look at all them orifices tho Kreygasm
[5:13:55] <SatansDick1> its an optional boss
[5:13:59] <xeros720> truly truly outrageous
[5:13:59] <+Suplexsenpai> it's not so bad
[5:13:59] <CptBritches> Smooth, Pat
[5:14:02] <magmakhan3> your spell can oneshot those adds and its hitbox is huge
[5:14:02] <Dakuu75> @AngriestPat might be time to take a break and read some donations?
[5:14:07] <EMP_Ike_Turner> go fight do
[5:14:07] <ukokira> It’s nice seeing this boss actually pull off an attack, It was my lost boss and it didn’t even do anything before dying

[5:14:28] <+Dimfish> goodbye 900 geo
[5:14:28] <+TeethMuncher> Just turn back
[5:14:29] <+SparkAfterDark> nothing wastes time like trying to save time
[5:14:30] <+brave_sj> Just be good at video games Pat 4Head
[5:14:33] <xeros720> just feel that salt nestle into your skin
[5:14:40] <%xemnahort> still wrong way pat
[5:14:42] <+Suplexsenpai> I guess it is so bad
[5:14:44] <SparkplaysPC> Resist the tilt
[5:14:48] <nepwar> big tilts
[5:14:48] <Rostichenburg> fragile strength would be good for this boss
[5:14:49] <pebblypirate> shade soul+flukemarm charm+shaman charm = EASY BOSSING
[5:14:51] <+gantz_zero> yeah, taking the wrong way is what killed you, not your hubris
[5:14:53] <+discodemolition> not gonna lie a bit of schadenfreud after how he rushed through soul asylum
[5:14:56] <Kalcom> 3000 money locked
[5:14:56] <asbestosflavored> 0 patience
[5:14:58] <HunterMGlengi> pat i think ur tired
[5:15:02] <AtlasMcCoy> This pleases me
[5:15:12] <Dakuu75> is there a charm that'd help against this constant barrage of damage and enemies? or something?
[5:15:12] <Hydrapissed> lol
[5:15:16] <+Dimfish> you might want to come back here another time
[5:15:26] <+vixenpunch> Pat take off some pets throw on quick focus and something else
[5:15:27] <Kalcom> after the other boss
[5:15:27] <%stigna1> And the flukes start comin and they don't stop comin.
[5:15:30] <Kalcom> this feels good
[5:15:30] <Tylerwashi> Take your time man
[5:15:30] <%xemnahort> why is pat still going the wrong way when he went the right way the first time
[5:15:31] <+SparkAfterDark> how quickly he has become complacent
[5:15:32] <+gantz_zero> it feels liek the summoner build has left him without a sense to actually fend for himself
[5:15:33] <+vixenpunch> To do this boss
[5:15:33] <+Suplexsenpai> 0 patience
[5:15:37] <$magikestral> im heading to bed y'all, make sure pat finishes up crystal peak for timestop
[5:15:37] <Donchalant402> this place isnt going to get any easier, no reason to put it off
[5:15:38] <%xemnahort> oh right for soul
[5:15:40] <ukokira> Taking them on one at a time helpsp
[5:15:41] <Coystick> the yelling
[5:15:47] <+TeethMuncher> come back later
[5:15:48] <joblessbone> schadenfreud is enjoying the emotional distress of others. unless you meant enjoying how pissed the chat was that doesn't make sense
[5:15:55] <%BioApple> @Dakuu75 Baldur Shell, Thorns, Quick Focus, or casting charms probably
[5:16:02] <leole11> essentially, if you can't one hit kill the flying cunts, the boss is 20 times harder
[5:16:03] <%BioApple> range charms help too
[5:16:05] <%Spydurman> summoner build has left him weak and he has forgotten how to git gud
[5:16:07] <SatansDick1> hit worms to get SOUL
[5:16:08] <pebblypirate> shaman charm is SO MUCH extra damage, esspecially with shade soul its ez pz
[5:16:16] <%stigna1> Folks, he's got this! The marm is actually quite easy, he'll just take a moment to adjust.
[5:16:18] <AtlasMcCoy> Can you do this tho?
[5:16:19] <CptBritches> He can do this
[5:16:22] <+Kawaso> @donchalant402 what? you know he will get damage upgrades, right? that makes it easier.
[5:16:24] <+BishopBain> Pat can do this. SeemsGood
[5:16:26] <kite1haseo> patience is a virtue, my young padawan
[5:16:27] <+TeethMuncher> [CRAZY TALK]
[5:16:30] <Hydrapissed> or just stand at a safe spot fend off fliers let summons kill boss
[5:16:31] <Dakuu75> @BioApple what does Baldur shell do?
[5:16:39] <Bonobonobone> OBLOHBLOBOJOHBOOLBO
[5:16:39] <Them00n> Pat can't do this
[5:16:40] <ukokira> I can’t wait for Pat to get [That Item] last
[5:16:42] <thetechnicalraven> ㄴCRAZY TALKㄱ
[5:16:43] <Kalcom> you are dealing no damage
[5:16:47] <asbestosflavored> already lost
[5:16:49] <%BioApple> @Dakuu75 IIRC it lets you take a hit or two while healing without interruption
[5:16:49] <+gantz_zero> it's a dps race!
[5:16:51] <%stigna1> @Dakuu75 Not Apple, but it blcoks attacks on you when you channel your SOUL.
[5:16:51] <+TeethMuncher> @Dakuu75 protects you while you focus
[5:16:56] <+Camail> having nail range helps on this boss
[5:17:01] <+SparkAfterDark> you can't out summon her pat
[5:17:05] <+SirSamVimes> if he focuses on killing the adds and his summons focus the boss, he could do it
[5:17:08] <ukokira> And watch him run around the map doing things for [that item]
[5:17:09] <+SirSamVimes> but it'd take forever
[5:17:11] <+brave_sj> I imagine recording audio for this area must have been fun
[5:17:15] <$Tredecian> swap build
[5:17:15] <nepwar> BIG backdowns
[5:17:18] <%kenpachi9211> apatDab DEATH COUNT 27 apatDab
[5:17:18] <Eresus> maybe changing charms
[5:17:20] <leole11> the back down
[5:17:23] <%stigna1> You got this; Marm is ez.
[5:17:23] <AtlasMcCoy> Coward strat failed
[5:17:24] <Them00n> Change build
[5:17:24] <+Suplexsenpai> smh
[5:17:24] <Donchalant402> @AngriestPat change builds
[5:17:24] <thetechnicalraven> LUL
[5:17:24] <tyrano191> Baldor shell is always good if you want time to take a breath
[5:17:25] <+brave_sj> BACK DOWN DENIED
[5:17:28] <Rostichenburg> @angriestpat fragile greed will let you one shot the minions
[5:17:28] <pebblypirate> change the charms
[5:17:29] <%xemnahort> get rid of glowing womb need the soul
[5:17:29] <+TeethMuncher> Come back alter, it's optional
[5:17:30] <+zaworldo> @AngriestPat need damage and range charms
[5:17:30] <fillamar> build change
[5:17:32] <ValidVenasaur> Your build is not good against it
[5:17:34] <magmakhan3> @AngriestPat your spell can oneshot those adds you should use it more
[5:17:35] <redlancer8> Better nail required
[5:17:35] <+Surf_Zombie> Does it have a max spawn count?
[5:17:36] <Nobrev> might need different charms
[5:17:37] <+NobleJedi> change your build
[5:17:38] <+SuperMonkey2> not with these charms
[5:17:39] <+JohnRMo> why dosent he take the shortcut?
[5:17:40] <Borealum_EX> BIG RUSHDOWN
[5:17:40] <Sleepology> you should change your build fr
[5:17:43] <SparkplaysPC> Maybe go blue tank build and race DPS?
[5:17:43] <redlancer8> Its super easy if you can one shot the adds
[5:17:43] <pebblypirate> build your change
[5:17:44] <+vixenpunch> Let me give you some advice, put on mark of pride and longnail so you can hit from the platforms
[5:17:44] <RedPlasticCup> swap up your trinkets. your bros arent doing much for ya
[5:17:46] <+Gohyakuen> damage and range
[5:17:46] <fillamar> Don't you just pogo?
[5:17:48] <%Spydurman> maybe try shooting it and using the adds for ammo
[5:17:49] <CptBritches> It would be better to adjust your build
[5:17:49] <+SparkAfterDark> It's not specifically difficult, it's that it's the EXACT kind of enemy that counters your build
[5:17:50] <Donchalant402> maybe try using baldur shell and spores
[5:17:51] <+Gohyakuen> so you can race the boss
[5:17:51] <%Everpresent_Overseer> What magic does Pat have?
[5:17:51] <SatansDick1> its a strong counter to your current build
[5:17:53] <Kalcom> hey fucker, can't heal?
[5:18:00] <Kalcom> use the no heal charm
[5:18:01] <ShawnEXE> don't forget about your big dumb flashy magic you just godlt
[5:18:01] <+Suplexsenpai> it's really not that bad if you mind the adds
[5:18:02] <Rostichenburg> fragile greed for damage
[5:18:03] <nepwar> its those adds that makes it hard not the boss itself
[5:18:05] <+Gohyakuen> lifeblood maybe
[5:18:10] <ukokira> Can pat do rhe big scream yet
[5:18:11] <%stigna1> Remember; reduce the foe's health to zero whilst maintaining your own! Works every time!
[5:18:12] <+zaworldo> All damage
[5:18:12] <leole11> fragile strength
[5:18:13] <Dakuu75> that boss looks like it'd have the gimic "hit/reflect the adds INTO the boss to do dmg" ya'know what I mean?
[5:18:14] <magmakhan3> its a real easy boss with anything other than the current build
[5:18:14] <ukokira> That’s probably help
[5:18:15] <custoadian> thorns of agony and pogo jumping helped me a lot
[5:18:17] <%stigna1> Noooo, not the fragiles!
[5:18:18] <+JustToWatch> quick focus
[5:18:19] <+Winnosh> Its just crazy thi is one of the earlier bosses i faced. And Pats only now on him
[5:18:20] <leole11> yeah
[5:18:21] <NerevaRising> squad doing more harm than good for this
[5:18:21] <Rostichenburg> fragile strength rather
[5:18:22] <+gantz_zero> >fragile
[5:18:22] <Hydrapissed> Quick focus is dope fragile is gana break lulz
[5:18:22] <leole11> easy money
[5:18:24] <Tisaric> RIP fragile
[5:18:24] <leole11> quick focus
[5:18:26] <+Camail> using fragile charm is...eh
[5:18:26] <AtlasMcCoy> Baldur's shells pretty good for this fight
[5:18:32] <ukokira> Jfc he did a lot this stream
[5:18:34] <%BioApple> @AngriestPat Pride
[5:18:35] <Sleepology> its good dmg, as long as you have egg
[5:18:40] <+SirSamVimes> @AngriestPat this boss is terribly designed because it's a nightmare if you can't one shot the adds, but it's a joke if you can
[5:18:42] <%stigna1> Range/damage on the nail. Just beat down the adds faster than they spawn.
[5:18:49] <leole11> i literally used my fragile charm throughout my entire first run
[5:18:50] <+Gohyakuen> it still interupts the healing
[5:18:50] <$Mendin> Fragile strength and replace your hearts with 2x soul hearts seems like a potential plan
[5:18:51] <+Dimfish> >fragile, oof better yet it in one go then
[5:18:51] <%xemnahort> can't be hurt while healing but can still be interupted
[5:18:55] <dandyspider> shell and thorns
[5:18:58] <pebblypirate> shaman charm so good
[5:19:01] <Donchalant402> thorns
[5:19:02] <CptBritches> If you invest into magic you can become a DPS machine
[5:19:04] <ukokira> Balders shell is only good for avoiding attacks
[5:19:08] <+Camail> nail range is important
[5:19:09] <+zaworldo> Fragile strength @AngriestPat
[5:19:11] <%xemnahort> grubsong is always good
[5:19:12] <+vixenpunch> Baldur shell longnail mark of pride
[5:19:19] <+Gorgodrn> Shells no good here
[5:19:20] <ShawnEXE> Thorns are really good in this fight
[5:19:22] <$Tredecian> longnail;
[5:19:27] <+TeethMuncher> @AngriestPat quick cast is your friend
[5:19:29] <Rostichenburg> power to one shot the minions
[5:19:29] <%Agami23> grubsong might be good for your "playstyle"
[5:19:30] <%mattmanj17> try thorns
[5:19:32] <RedPlasticCup> quick focus
[5:19:32] <LixFury> thorns
[5:19:34] <%stigna1> Nail length/strength. YOu can kill adds faster than they spawn.
[5:19:34] <dandyspider> thorns and shell let you have a spiked shrild wall
[5:19:35] <+Suplexsenpai> nail range is boss
[5:19:36] <ukokira> Which doesn’t seem rhat uselful here since you need to kill what’s attacking you
[5:19:38] <NerevaRising> range is really usefull for this fight @AngriestPat
[5:19:39] <fazoburquina> I just got here, how huge has Pat gotten?
[5:19:41] <Donchalant402> replace grubsong with thorns
[5:19:45] <+vixenpunch> @angriestpat baldur shell longnail mark of pride
[5:19:45] <pebblypirate> use your nail art
[5:19:50] <$DeathmanJones> Thorns of Agony is useful for this one
[5:19:58] <Donchalant402> nail art also really helps here yeah
[5:19:59] <Dakuu75> @Donchalant402 what is Thron, do?
[5:20:00] <%xemnahort> @fazoburquina not huge enough for this
[5:20:03] <Eresus> lol
[5:20:03] <%stigna1> Flukemarm: An insatiable breeder. Has populated the Waterways with its kind. Its insides double as a nest for young Flukefeys. The desire to breed, to leave behind a memory of ourselves in the shape of a child... it seems to be etched deep into heart of every living creature. I too have felt the pull of that base instinct.
[5:20:04] <cerberuscarmine> min mins are sleeping for now
[5:20:05] <@thenefftw> !uptime
[5:20:05] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 5h 20m 7s.
[5:20:07] <alcors_wisdom> speaking of builds what do you think of that card system in fallout 76
[5:20:09] <%BioApple> @fazoburquina has a minion build that fucked up soul sanctum but this area's ruckusing him
[5:20:09] <nepwar> I think his black hado also one shots the adds no?
[5:20:10] <CptBritches> Why doesn't Pat just equip the Time stop charm and kill the boss easy?
[5:20:11] <SatansDick1> replace grubsong with thorns
[5:20:13] <fillamar> ya blew it
[5:20:18] <Rostichenburg> remember the spin attack
[5:20:19] <ukokira> Honestly thorns of agony while bum rushing the big boy should help
[5:20:21] <AtlasMcCoy> God these noises
[5:20:22] <ryu1299> hey does anyone else lose all their soul when they reload a save ?
[5:20:24] <ShawnEXE> thorn does an aoe counterattack when you get hit
[5:20:26] <SparkplaysPC> Actually yes, maybe try helicopter blade, since boss is big and stationary
[5:20:34] <SatansDick1> @ShawnEXE yes
[5:20:34] <NerevaRising> I miss the squad already
[5:20:35] <fazoburquina> thank ay!
[5:20:38] <%xemnahort> @stigna1 should you be putting up hunter entries for things he hasn't killed yet?
[5:20:45] <%DedlokPM> @alcors_wisdom I don't care what they say. It reeks of mini0buys
[5:20:45] <+gantz_zero> time saving isn't time saving
[5:20:50] <%DedlokPM> mini-buys*
[5:20:53] <tyrano191> baldor + pride and thorns got me through a lot
[5:20:54] <$RaikenTB> And to think there are actual maggot farmers in the world WutFace
[5:21:02] <Futurecity10> I have this going on in the back ground and it sounds fucking horrific
[5:21:06] <MonocledGhost> Balder shell and thorns synergise, when the shell breaks, it procs thorns w/o you having to take damage
[5:21:11] <alcors_wisdom> i just think its a poorly thought out system @DedlokPM
[5:21:13] <Dakuu75> oh sic, the baldur shell actualy shows a little shield appear while you focus, neat
[5:21:20] <%stigna1> @xemnahort I figure he's rumbled it; its not like anythings gonna change and this way people get to see it in the otherwise dead time of the third boss-run.
[5:21:30] <%stigna1> Speaking of which, Youngest of its species. Its body is composed of teeth, wings and stomach. Seems to want to latch onto any living thing that comes by with its sharp little teeth. It will leave its cousins alone though, so it isn't completely mindless.
[5:21:31] <Kghaleon> RaikenTB Don't talk about plague like that.
[5:21:35] <%stigna1> The Flukefey.
[5:21:37] <pebblypirate> bounce from the top
[5:21:39] <+gantz_zero> @Dakuu75 it's literally only cosmetics for sale. the card packs are from playing the game and levelling
[5:21:39] <SparkplaysPC> Bounce on it
[5:21:41] <+Suplexsenpai> why tho
[5:21:41] <%BioApple> Oh, spore was a good idea against these adds
[5:21:43] <+TeethMuncher> @RaikenTB no one else is cleaning sores
[5:21:47] <%BioApple> or not lol
[5:21:50] <+Dimfish> use the spin attack
[5:21:59] <+Suplexsenpai> no pat
[5:22:02] <Donchalant402> it helps to not get swarmed
[5:22:12] <ShawnEXE> fuck the shell, get the thorns instead
[5:22:16] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> Killing these kids isn't working, I have to beat them at the source: Their mother!
[5:22:16] <ukokira> Yeah shell isn’t great unless you got thorns or something
[5:22:17] <ShawnEXE> it's so much better
[5:22:24] <%xemnahort> Does he have shamon stone yet
[5:22:25] <ukokira> They’ll just bumrush you right after blocking them
[5:22:28] <pebblypirate> shade soul yeah!
[5:22:32] <CapCasual> @AngriestPat Heal on the plataform, so you can damage the boss as well.
[5:22:33] <+HyperionXV> Wow they just phase through the shell

[5:24:38] <+Gorgodrn> It was nerfed. But it is still good
[5:24:38] <AtlasMcCoy> Wasnt the experience itself worth 1000 geo?
[5:24:41] <Dakuu75> I swear to gawd, if it summons things making that gross sound-effect...

[5:25:07] <%xemnahort> @AngriestPat since you get hit a lot grubsong is probably very useful to you
[5:25:07] <%stigna1> The shaman stone makes the flukes be larger and hit harder. The defenders crest converts it into a single massive fluke that explodes into a poisonous cloud. Charm interactions!
[5:25:09] <Dakuu75> idk how I feel about that
[5:25:10] <aeonicvector> more damage
[5:25:11] <Sleepology> its a lot stronger too

[5:25:29] <$Mendin> No defender's charm... ... ... yet... ... ...

Laughter spreads like a disease, and soon everyone is laughing at you. You need to strike at the source of this perverse merriment quickly to stop it from spreading.

[5:33:39] <%badmr7> night everyone

[5:33:44] <CptBritches> Whoa
[5:33:45] <Donchalant402> @SatansDick1 not like it matters without a key

[5:34:54] <%stigna1> @xemnahort Well, once you have summons you can just stand next to the platform and AFK the whole fight. He's got the charms to totally triviallize the fight.
[5:35:09] <cerberuscarmine> MEDIC
[5:35:10] <%BioApple> I always thought those guys looked like they had binkies in their mouths

[5:35:23] <Arweynn> You can get your money now, pat.
[5:35:26] <%stigna1> @Sokumotanaka Growing old is manditory. Growing feeble is optional. Follow your dreams, mate.
[5:35:27] <AtlasMcCoy> They're aristocrats, of course they're weak
[5:35:28] <cerberuscarmine> punch bois
[5:35:30] <Tisaric> He doesn't have a key
[5:35:37] <thetechnicalraven> and chat SMOrc
[5:35:39] <pebblypirate> yeah he does
[5:35:42] <Donchalant402> @AngriestPat there is an optional path in deepnest that you can access now that leads to some pale ore
[5:35:46] <%stigna1> Husk Dandy: Former member of Hallownest's high society. Limited offensive ability. It seems the weakest, greediest members of Hallownest were also the one who exerted the most influence. Truly a Kingdom that was always destined for ruin.
[5:35:47] <HunterMGlengi> ya'll know what this means?
[5:35:49] <%xemnahort> why does he only check the map after finding out where he is
[5:35:51] <%PatNTheHat> This is why the proletariat uprising is inevitable
[5:35:52] <Sokumotanaka> @stigna1 /thanks mom
[5:35:55] <HunterMGlengi> we can get our fuckin money

[5:36:12] <Donchalant402> cant get money
[5:36:13] <Dakuu75> Question: Are there ANY other NPC in this game that DON'T want to murder you? Seems like there's only enemies everywhere.
[5:36:13] <AWinglessMonkey> did he get another key?
[5:36:13] <Rostichenburg> nope no key he used it for the sewers
[5:36:15] <Donchalant402> no simple key
[5:36:16] <tyrano191> You have found the 1% of the bug people
[5:36:19] <%Divryne> DANNY WHERE'S MY FUCKING MONEY?

[5:36:42] <Sokumotanaka> @stigna1 XD
[5:36:43] <%stigna1> @Dakuu75 Yup! Plenty of friends and even some allies. They are just rare in a hostile world.
[5:36:45] <%PatNTheHat> I-I don't have your money! It'sin Bill's house, a-and Fred's house!
[5:36:46] <joblessbone> how do all these bugs stay warm when its so dark forever?

[5:36:57] <+Kawaso> no
[5:36:57] <+Dimfish> no
[5:37:01] <sirrice77> @Dakuu75 merchants, people that you rescue, other explorers
[5:37:08] <+TeethMuncher> @joblessbone most are dead and the caverns are humid
[5:37:13] <+brave_sj> So no big murders yet then
[5:37:17] <leole11> use desolate dive
[5:37:19] <Tisaric> Does he need to do lost kin for nail? I forget
[5:37:21] <pebblypirate> that door
[5:37:28] <tyrano191> don’t talk about it
[5:37:29] <Kghaleon> These dudes are just black knights.
[5:37:31] <%stigna1> Great husk sentries: Animated remains of a Great Sentry, the most elite of the city's guards. Wields a greatnail and shell. Its powerful attacks cause heavy damage. An extremely rare thing, a bug of Hallownest that actually poses a threat. Watch them carefully, as they can Lash Out quickly with devastating strikes.

[5:41:34] <ShawnEXE> I forgot how you get the other simple key
[5:41:35] <%stigna1> Gluttenous HUsk: Former member of Hallownest's high society. Uses its corpulent body as a weapon. As these bugs became wealthier they hunted less and consumed more, eventually taking on a grotesque shape not unlike over-ripe fruit.
[5:41:36] <alcors_wisdom> is this detriot become bug?
[5:41:40] <Hydrapissed> a video porn
[5:41:41] <cerberuscarmine> XD

[5:41:54] <%PatNTheHat> Do you think my pastor would still be upset if I told him the reason I'm skipping church tomorrow is that I stayed up all night watching a CHRISTIAN STREAM?
[5:41:54] <CptBritches> WOMBO

[5:42:46] <knomad2b> damn
[5:42:52] <nepwar> stylish
[5:42:53] <%stigna1> Cowardly Husk: Former member of Hallownest's high society. Although made aggressive by the force inside, old instincts still occasionally compel it to run from danger. The fearful, cowardly nature of these Hallownest bugs persists even after death! It almost feels shameful to chase and cut them down.
[5:42:53] <QaizerArt> @PatNTheHat Tell your pastor you were up all night doing research (watching Pat play hollow knight) for a project (playing Hollow Knight)
[5:43:05] <%Agami23> he spent the first two hours fucking around to make chat mad
[5:43:07] <%BioApple> you're learning about souls
[5:43:07] <tyrano191> like another 10% through the game JGardner88

[5:43:41] <+SparkAfterDark> Pat has lost his faith in the banks after making a poor investment, and now seeks to take the wealth of the bourgeoisie to redistribute it into governmental programs such as public transport. We are watching the birth of communism live
[5:43:45] <Donchalant402> this aggressive version of the city of tears theme
[5:43:45] <QaizerArt> These Stag Beetle Knights look cool as fuck. Like they're outta Kamen Rider or something.

[6:04:58] <+NobleJedi> GIT GUD
[6:04:59] <tyrano191> Bosses are much tougher
[6:04:59] <%Agami23> you cant beat him right now
[6:05:01] <Kghaleon> This guy took me 12 tries
[6:05:02] <Eresus> you are not ready
[6:05:02] <%Metal_Slime_King> double jump required
[6:05:02] <alcors_wisdom> maybe you should put on your winnions
[6:05:03] <Tisaric> Way underleveled
[6:05:04] <aeonicvector> SOOOO its offical, im reinstalling this game, i get the appeal now!!!

[6:05:06] <AWinglessMonkey> you gonna need more stuff
[6:05:07] <HunterMGlengi> soooooo, it is very not recommended to fight this guy now
[6:05:09] <SparkplaysPC> It super is
[6:05:09] <Burpinator1> He could use a few Time Stops
[6:05:09] <%bootysteve> HEY GUYS TELL HIM YOU CAN USE FRAGILE CHARMS SOME MORE
[6:05:09] <Eresus> but nice try
[6:05:09] <sirrice77> you dont need double jump actually
[6:05:11] <+Gohyakuen> soul master is beatable
[6:05:11] <runsoverfrogs> pat needs to get big
[6:05:13] <%Divryne> Nail the sleeping spider lady or something.
[6:05:13] <pebblypirate> fragile charms work here without breaking
[6:05:14] <ShawnEXE> you are not ready
[6:05:16] <joblessbone> TIME STOP
[6:05:19] <alcors_wisdom> never got that double jump
[6:05:19] <$Mendin> Now THAT"S a boss worth bringing his Summoner Bullshit to
[6:05:20] <NerevaRising> try dream soul master for a fun time @AngriestPat
[6:05:21] <+TeethMuncher> @AngriestPat mark your map
[6:05:21] <DXLelouch24> ots a Super Boss
[6:05:24] <leole11> Fragile charms don't break from dream battles
[6:05:30] <Kalavs> PAT EQUIP THE WINIONS AND USE THE CRYSTQL HEART TO STAY AT THE CORNER
[6:05:30] <DXLelouch24> THIS METROIDVANIA HAS FUCKIN SUPER BOSSES
[6:05:33] <damienlunas> The Black Time Stop is so helpful for that boss
[6:05:34] <Admiral_PopnFresh> on the plus side, no penalty for death
[6:05:42] <+SuperMonkey2> glade
[6:05:42] <+Camail> dream bosses give a ton of essence
[6:05:45] <+brave_sj> @AngriestPat Dream deaths don't break your vessel or take your geo so they can make dream bosses as absurd as they want
[6:05:48] <%stigna1> @damienlunas oh wow, that would be.
[6:05:56] <%xemnahort> @DXLelouch24 of course why wouldn't it
[6:05:56] <Borealum_EX> smash dat coffin button
[6:05:58] <ShawnEXE> yeyeye
[6:06:03] <+vixenpunch> Yeye
[6:06:06] <bambowl> what's with referring to everything as a time stop now
[6:06:07] <SparkplaysPC> Smack the tree!
[6:06:15] <AtlasMcCoy> He was one of, if not the easiest dream boss btw
[6:06:18] <nepwar> pull a logan and descreate a corpse
[6:06:21] <%BioApple> @bambowl joke from the god of war playthrough, good for avoiding spoilers
[6:06:23] <Tisaric> time stop is the non-spoiler way to say metroid item
[6:06:24] <Bonobonobone> uh oh
[6:06:25] <%stigna1> @bambowl In the God of War LP they kept failing puzzles and blaming it on not having time stop.
[6:06:27] <Donchalant402> @AngriestPat dying in the dream doesnt a real death so you can use all the fragile charms you want and they wont break
[6:06:27] <Kghaleon> You can find it on your own, but the game has a teleport item.

[6:19:04] <+darthriven501> its fucking fine
[6:19:05] <pebblypirate> you get one essence from ghosts but it doesnt change any mechanics
[6:19:05] <+JustToWatch> its fine, just evil and pointless
[6:19:07] <joblessbone> lol chat you're a dick
[6:19:07] <HunterMGlengi> it's harmless to kill ghosts, but not worth it tbh
[6:19:08] <DivineDragoonKain> It's fine to absorb them, just don't do it in the sacred grove place
[6:19:08] <+vixenpunch> Nail it all
[6:19:09] <%ArcanumMBD> @AngriestPat that guy was a friendly npc ghost, but killing him is nbd. I did the same thing
[6:19:13] <PeteyMcPickle> JUST MORALLY NOT FINE
[6:19:14] <+Dimfish> its MEAN but it wont ruin your game
[6:19:17] <AWinglessMonkey> ghosts are food for your blade

[6:19:20] <+NobleJedi> you're setting their souls fre
[6:19:21] <Tisaric> I love how dope the crystal dash looks
[6:19:25] <HunterMGlengi> you don't need to kill any ghosts
[6:19:26] <Hydrapissed> I mean its for the greater good guys
[6:19:27] <AtlasMcCoy> Pat im getting kinda tired, maybe you should stop streaming so i can sleep
[6:19:32] <pebblypirate> emotions are prohibited
[6:19:34] <badwinkles_> remember when Paige fucked that cowboy?
[6:19:38] <AncelDeLambert> HAH
[6:19:38] <iyashino_ken> Y'all don't know
[6:19:39] <%Divryne> Pat should do the dreamer in Deepnest before he goes to sleep.
[6:19:41] <joblessbone> must get big
[6:19:43] <ShawnEXE> hollow knight and passer of soul? definitely bleach
[6:19:50] <joblessbone> big time stop quest
[6:19:51] <tyrano191> but there not souls their just memories
[6:19:51] <nepwar> nail them
[6:19:56] <+brave_sj> @AngriestPat That's your tutorial on how ghosts are killed permanently by the dreamnail. It only really affects anything in one place, which you'll know when you see it
[6:19:57] <pebblypirate> magic these guys
[6:19:58] <alcors_wisdom> pat should get his money back
[6:19:59] <+discodemolition> @Divryne has he done any yet?
[6:20:02] <DivineDragoonKain> by the way, those laser beam dudes can be hit by magic
[6:20:10] <%Divryne> No but he's found the one in deepnest.
[6:20:14] <+discodemolition> cause if he hasn't he should leave the dreamers till he does the grey lady
[6:20:21] <ShawnEXE> wait what's pat doing here :o
[6:20:22] <golguin1> he's already done a Dreamer?
[6:20:24] <pebblypirate> crystal dash
[6:20:25] <Tisaric> The crushers are the worst
[6:20:28] <+JustToWatch> it's literally pointless to dreamnail ghosts, 1 essence is meaningless
[6:20:31] <golguin1> yes there is a way to turn them off
[6:20:33] <Admiral_PopnFresh> ZA WARUDO
[6:20:34] <%BioApple> @golguin1 found the body but hasn't actually done it
[6:20:37] <seamitten> dream nail the crushers!
[6:20:41] <Rostichenburg> the switch to turn them off is at the other set
[6:20:41] <TheEdrem> if only you could stop time
[6:20:43] <%stigna1> Well, its unclear if those are souls or memories. But the nail seems to cleanse them either way, waking them up from a stupor/mental trap and allows them to "move on." It seems to be be an honourable release, at least as far as I could tell.
[6:20:44] <%bootysteve> Why's he here
[6:20:49] <$shadow1man9> @AngriestPat You need to do that crusher section you kept skipping
[6:20:55] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Toki wo tomare!

[6:33:54] <tyrano191> woo
[6:33:54] <%Divryne> Crystal Peak.
[6:33:54] <+zaworldo> WUH HUH
[6:33:56] <zaiwolfgang> Deepnest
[6:33:58] <+Kawaso> not yet
[6:33:59] <Donchalant402> @AngriestPat you can get a pale ore now in deepnest
[6:33:59] <$shadow1man9> @AngriestPat There is a breakable ceiling in the room right before the Grub Father
[6:33:59] <%BioApple> @AngriestPat I think there's one you can get but it might be spoilers?
[6:34:01] <+vixenpunch> Not yet then
[6:34:02] <leole11> several places
[6:34:03] <+vixenpunch> I know he does
[6:34:03] <+darthriven501> deepnest
[6:34:04] <%stigna1> He needs time stop
[6:34:07] <zaiwolfgang> He needs timestop for the crystal peak one
[6:34:08] <Kalcom> deep
[6:34:08] <golguin1> has he tried the thing?
[6:34:08] <custoadian> crystal peak ore needs a timestop
[6:34:10] <+Gohyakuen> needs double time stop
[6:34:10] <@StridentSong> Second Collesium fight
[6:34:11] <Heyestus> 100 geo away from heart piece
[6:34:12] <SparkplaysPC> Only after time stop
[6:34:12] <AtlasMcCoy> Pat, that thing you missed in deepnest gives you one
[6:34:13] <+vixenpunch> Go upper right in the next room
[6:34:15] <magmakhan3> needs time stop before the crystal peak one
[6:34:15] <fazoburquina> @AngriestPat at the very top of Crystal Peak there is one
[6:34:16] <Donchalant402> to the left of the spring in deepnest
[6:34:16] <%stigna1> But yes, deepnest.
[6:34:16] <leole11> don't worry about it
[6:34:16] <golguin1> the thing where you get one of the ores?
[6:34:19] <Coystick> He needs tounlock SLEEP
[6:34:20] <%stigna1> East of the hot springs.
[6:34:20] <+discodemolition> he can't get the one in the peak yet
[6:34:23] <%Metal_Slime_King> There are 6 pale ores
[6:34:24] <+darthriven501> deepnest secret
[6:34:25] <nepwar> don't worry about it babe
[6:34:26] <redlancer8> Up in the last room
[6:34:26] <%Divryne> Deepnest should be real quick.
[6:34:30] <+vixenpunch> Upper right in hallway
[6:34:30] <CptBritches> He needs quadruple time travel
[6:34:31] <+Leroytirebiter> you just need to collect more essence, which will just take a little time
[6:34:32] <$Mendin> crystal peak and I think deepnest both need timestop
[6:34:33] <ValidVenasaur> Kingdom's Edge
[6:34:33] <redlancer8> From the light
[6:34:34] <AWinglessMonkey> the deepnest one should be done with a stronger nail ...
[6:34:35] <%xemnahort> @fazoburquina he needs TIME STOP for that
[6:34:37] <+vixenpunch> Room before
[6:34:37] <Tisaric> oh no
[6:34:38] <+Leroytirebiter> oh dear
[6:34:38] <$Tredecian> then deepnest
[6:34:38] <CptBritches> lmao
[6:34:38] <SparkplaysPC> You should probably head down under the city next, for BIG time stop
[6:34:39] <+TeethMuncher> @AngriestPat take the other tram if you can and get lost
[6:34:39] <+SuperMonkey2> oh boy
[6:34:39] <%stigna1> The only one he can get is from deepenest, east of the springs.
[6:34:40] <+vixenpunch> Go into the light
[6:34:40] <magmakhan3> uhh
[6:34:40] <Donchalant402> he cant get the one in crystal peak without timestop
[6:34:41] <+SilasDrekken> OhGod

[6:37:13] <RyoRyan92> all bad options
[6:37:14] <%skizzuto> queen's station, probs
[6:37:14] <Donchalant402> stag
[6:37:14] <%stigna1> Deepenest, west of the hot springs. Fastest is from the Queens statio nstop and down.
[6:37:15] <zaiwolfgang> stag
[6:37:16] <$SGrim> She wants your weird bug ejaculate. rooLewd
[6:37:17] <ValidVenasaur> Queen's Station
[6:37:17] <nepwar> OHohhooo huehueheuehoohohoho
[6:37:19] <+discodemolition> stag to distant
[6:37:20] <+MetaSla> There are no fast ways through Deepnest
[6:37:27] <+vixenpunch> Queens station and down
[6:37:28] <Endocrom> Hohohohoo, it's infectious!
[6:37:29] <AWinglessMonkey> god. it would be faster to go to a new area below
[6:37:29] <%Agami23> i dunno why but the charm merchant reminds me of matt
[6:37:35] <SparkplaysPC> Actually no, King's Station would be faster
[6:37:41] <NerevaRising> yes you can
[6:37:43] <alcors_wisdom> its the bandana @Agami23
[6:37:44] <Donchalant402> deepnest is annoying because its huge, and there is so much shit to do
[6:37:47] <+TeethMuncher> @Agami23 cap and solid build
[6:37:49] <AWinglessMonkey> and if you went to the new area and below youd have an easier ore down there
[6:37:50] <%stigna1> Nice!
[6:37:50] <seamitten> WUT
[6:37:50] <%Divryne> Aye
[6:37:52] <+Dimfish> easiest way would be to cut thru mantis lords and pop into the back end of deepnest, but uts a longer route
[6:37:58] <joblessbone> I like the limitations to the fast travel in this.
[6:38:04] <ShawnEXE> nice

[6:56:57] <%BioApple> The stream cannot stop until Time Stop is defeated
[6:57:10] <Boya1995> The dreamer fight in deepnest is very easy the challange is escaping the den and getting to the bench wich you already did

[7:05:40] <custoadian> Nosk was buffed with one of the patches- maybe Lifeblood?
[7:05:40] <SparkplaysPC> I think they buffed him, ddin't see some of those moves
[7:05:43] <AWinglessMonkey> them minions might actually be able to do it

[7:07:14] <nexoosen> O shit didnt notice that there are other pc--lookin dude in the background
[7:07:23] <$Mendin> the grand lake of dung, hidden now from sight
[7:07:31] <KekFrog> Nosk has a pretty great read on you there, Pat.
[7:07:36] <%mister___doctor> This game is longer than my penis

[7:08:04] <+MetaSla> PogChamp

[7:08:21] <Heyestus> NAIL
[7:08:27] <$Tredecian> its a good trick
[7:08:31] <+brave_sj> Not anymore he doesn't
[7:08:34] <Tisaric> dream nailing bosses is just pain waiting to happen, it's not worth it
[7:08:35] <SparkplaysPC> Evel Hollow Knights ;)
[7:08:37] <%stigna1> Nosk: Mimics the shape of other creatures to lure prey to it's lair. In the deepest darkness, there are beasts who wear faces stolen from your memories and pluck at the strings in your heart. Know yourself, and stay strong.
[7:08:39] <SparkplaysPC> *even
[7:08:39] <%ArcanumMBD> to right
[7:08:40] <Neo_Kaiser> Whenever Pat doesn't dab on stream, people should be asking, "Where's dabbing?"
[7:08:42] <%xemnahort> dream nail only works when its alive
[7:08:45] <Boya1995> The dreamer fight in deepnest is very easy the challange is escaping the den and getting to the bench wich you already did the rest takes two minutes
[7:08:48] <%D_day> apatDab apatDab apatDab
[7:08:52] <%Divryne> YEET.

[7:09:15] <Tisaric> LETS GO
[7:09:16] <%stigna1> When dream nailed nosk will say "..."
[7:09:16] <QaizerArt> DREAM NAIL WORKS ON BOSSES?
[7:09:16] <%xemnahort> @AngriestPat good job now just give the nailsmith 2000 geo and you'll get an upgrade
[7:09:17] <+vixenpunch> FREE US
[7:09:21] <ShawnEXE> wait he needs moneys
[7:09:24] <%stigna1> And yes, dream nail works on bosses.
[7:09:25] <%BioApple> He hasn't gotten the upgrade yet, just the material >:3
[7:09:25] <ShawnEXE> FUCK LMAO

[7:09:36] <%Seheti> Holy fuck he’s still going, I went to play god of war like 3 hours ago. Not that I’m complaining
[7:09:42] <+Dimfish> you will need 800 geo if i remember right
[7:09:43] <%xemnahort> @QaizerArt dream nail works on everthing
[7:09:43] <+TeethMuncher> LUL
[7:09:43] <+darthriven501> naw hes good on money
[7:09:50] <RyoRyan92> go to the train
[7:09:51] <joblessbone> how far away from money are we?
[7:09:52] <custoadian> Tram might be the quickest way out?
[7:09:55] <+Sam_Tzu> might as well beat the game at this point
[7:09:56] <+discodemolition> go to the right
[7:09:59] <%BioApple> worst case scenario he's got crap to sell
[7:09:59] <ValidVenasaur> Tram right of spring
[7:09:59] <narusao> no sleep till brooklyn
[7:10:00] <+discodemolition> of the hot springs
[7:10:00] <magmakhan3> might as well just use the tram and go through another area now
[7:10:03] <QaizerArt> @xemnahort i think i'm dropping dead cells for a bit to play hollow knight
[7:10:17] <golguin1> Waking the Dreamer?
[7:10:19] <Boya1995> The dreamer fight in deepnest is very easy the challange is escaping the den and getting to the bench wich you already did
[7:10:28] <+Dimfish> @sam_tzu are you nuts hes nowhere near that far in
[7:10:30] <%xemnahort> @QaizerArt both are really good for different reasons
[7:10:34] <AtlasMcCoy> !uptime
[7:10:34] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 7h 10m 36s.
[7:10:45] <+Dimfish> hes going for a complete run
[7:10:48] <%ArcanumMBD> this is it, you marked it shitty
[7:10:51] <$Tredecian> this is just lore
[7:10:52] <+Sam_Tzu> having no context yes
[7:10:53] <%Divryne> Wrong way.
[7:10:58] <%BioApple> @Dimfish that's why it's a 24 hour stream Kappa
[7:11:00] <QaizerArt> @xemnahort Of course, I've just played a shitton of Dead Cells recently. About an hour or 2 a day for the past week.
[7:11:03] <SparkplaysPC> Pat needs 800 geo for the upgrade, but he also has tons of sellables
[7:11:06] <Donchalant402> what you marked was a spirit boss
[7:11:06] <%stigna1> YOu didn't have the map when you marked it, I assume.
[7:11:09] <%ArcanumMBD> no wait i lied

[7:11:46] <bambowl> yes
[7:11:46] <Donchalant402> its not that simple
[7:11:47] <Boya1995> The dreamer fight in deepnest is very easy the challange is escaping the den and getting to the bench wich you already did it. It takes two minutes to do the rest
[7:11:47] <+vixenpunch> Kill me

[7:12:04] <%xemnahort> @Breakfast_Megapowers he can't sell eggs in this playthrough
[7:12:05] <Tisaric> He's probably hit about 40%
[7:12:08] <Rostichenburg> dont do dreamer yet you miss lore

[7:12:23] <nepwar> im really surprised pat can pull a stream for the whole night. I can barely stand staying awake for a day without hallucinating
[7:12:26] <+Dimfish> pbffft
[7:12:35] <Donchalant402> LOOK AT THE MAP PAT

[7:13:02] <joblessbone> boomer pat just sips his red bull and the need for sleep goes away

[7:14:15] <Donchalant402> he set the lamp marked WAY above this you guys
[7:14:18] <%BioApple> no that mark was specifically because there was an interesting thing off the map
