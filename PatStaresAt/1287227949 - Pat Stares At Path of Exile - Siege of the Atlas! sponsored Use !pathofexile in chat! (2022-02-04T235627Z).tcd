[0:25:41] <tanarath> Oh, it's fantastic
[0:25:43] <jeppeww> it didn't look great backthen i can tell you :P
[0:25:43] <+keiji_maede> Better then pokemon?
[0:25:47] <Esipode> They make regular graphic improvements every major update
[0:25:47] <+Rutheniel> Theyre constantly reupdating it
[0:25:47] <retrosadness> it got several graphical overhauls
[0:25:48] <ergulor> it got updated a while ago
[0:25:49] <%Man_in_the_Red> they have been patching the lighting passes over a long ass time
[0:25:50] <hardin360> Several overhauls
[0:25:51] <+WhiteClaudiaMk> it did
[0:25:52] <tanarath> Yes and Yes
[0:25:52] <cartakus> and it will look better
[0:25:54] <EASrake> The water did
[0:25:54] <+keiji_maede> Better then new pokemon?
[0:25:57] <viciousgrim> will you be playing coop with peach @p
[0:25:58] <%Broand> They do graphics passes, and the PoE2 zones look really good
[0:25:58] <1matheuw> it looks like a 2017 game
[0:25:58] <chowndawg> they do graphic upgrades over time
[0:25:59] <RAH001> There’s bees updates
[0:26:00] <%Ashrox117> I played it back in 2019 and it looked awesome then
[0:26:02] <Zourath> It's gone through, like, 3 graphical overhauls.
[0:26:07] <%JoshManVGH> Damn, I hope this plays well on console!
[0:26:11] <Enn19> Some of the hideouts are BEAUTIFUL
[0:26:12] <%Chichen> same
[0:26:19] <cartakus> lol diablo 2
[0:26:33] <CzeekyTV> this does look more realistic, but i think d3 has it beat on visual clarity. some things in this bleed together visually
[0:26:33] <%Bane_Kaikyo> @SomeStrangeBroad Oh, I just thought you were scared of pooping alone
[0:26:43] <segychan> yay yay yay
[0:26:45] <viciousgrim> so chat will he die at this boss?
[0:26:49] <%JoshManVGH> You can just unsocket shit!?
[0:26:54] <segychan> I'm marking out
[0:27:00] <%Eldalu> Eldalu subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 23 months! Hi Pat!

[0:27:04] <jeppeww> Hillock too stronk, first death incoming
[0:27:07] <%Man_in_the_Red> @viciousgrim hopefully
[0:27:08] <%Dova573> Also gems that are equipped but not used will till gain exp to lvl up
[0:27:13] <Enn19> Good tip,when a gem levels up,the stat requirements and mana cost ALSO get higher
[0:27:14] <urkleturtle> path of exile 2 will run on the same game client, so poe 1 is getting pretty'd up alongside its development
[0:27:16] <+goney> love smashin on bros
[0:27:25] <%CappuccinoGuil> When you're smashing on your bro, as we all do, love smashing my bros
[0:27:31] <%Birdigalore> Friday night is for smashin' bros
[0:27:32] <ergulor> yu
[0:27:33] <+WhiteClaudiaMk> he'll keep smashing
[0:27:33] <ergulor> p
[0:27:35] <Daxalog> We would
[0:27:35] <%Chichen> i would
[0:27:36] <%Dova573> nope
[0:27:37] <@PrefectusCorgi> Yes will
[0:27:39] <Enn19> No that'd be cool
[0:27:40] <segychan> do it, no balls
[0:27:42] <EASrake> please do
[0:27:42] <$RedBandolier> would not judge, would encourage
[0:27:43] <tanarath> No?
[0:27:45] <ergulor> i wouldn't i love this game
[0:27:47] <urkleturtle> it's quite the rabbit hole
[0:27:48] <Gorgs7> I totally will
[0:27:48] <cartakus> Nah
[0:27:49] <%JoshManVGH> Nah this seems cool
[0:27:49] <@DakotaMacDoodle> no its fun
[0:27:50] <segychan> hell yes
[0:27:52] <tolloponik> this game is supper Addictive
[0:27:52] <RAH001> U can cancel animations
[0:27:54] <Enn19> I would watch that shit all the time
[0:27:59] <%zenraider> do it up
[0:28:02] <retrosadness> loot filters?
[0:28:02] <AnnoyedApricot> loot filters?
[0:28:03] <jeppeww> filters
[0:28:04] <%Dakuu75> we judged you for playing League of Legends. We literally won't judge you for this one. -because it's good.
[0:28:06] <+Rutheniel> Also, if you experience lagspikes, i recommend switching to Vulkan in the options menu, but do it from the main menu because it causes the game to re-render everything. Also it CAN make everything appear way darker in windowed and windowed fullscreen!
[0:28:07] <%Ashrox117> FFXIV dead game, you heard it here first
[0:28:07] <ergulor> lootfilter
[0:28:07] <cartakus> Elden ring waiting room
[0:28:08] <%Chichen> pat have you seen the fucking skill tree in this game
[0:28:08] <chowndawg> it's probably the best time ever to get into it
[0:28:09] <%Aeogard> @PatStaresAt  you got 21 days till elden ring so whatever to fill the void :)
[0:28:12] <XelanArdel> loot filters are good
[0:28:14] <Enn19> Yeah,there's so much loot in this game you can get your own to make it easier,see better loot,etc
[0:28:15] <EASrake> There's a lot to learn. Good game to pick up for a while
[0:28:15] <+WhiteClaudiaMk> okay skill tree coming up
[0:28:16] <%Man_in_the_Red> you can filter out garbage with Filterblade
[0:28:16] <BepBepAmShep> loot filters is the term you're looking for
[0:28:17] <ergulor> the item clarity in the late game is terrible
[0:28:17] <+Aikao> Look at the skill tree though monkaS
[0:28:18] <cpt_langosta> Game says: That "FULL HEAL" is no longer a full heal. LOL"
[0:28:18] <Enn19> Here we go
[0:28:21] <+Rutheniel> BREATHE
[0:28:22] <+Shockrates20XX> Bucket on your head
[0:28:23] <Amirios> here it comes
[0:28:23] <+SmigGames> judging Pat is part of the fun
[0:28:23] <+Fabpsi_> OH GOD
[0:28:26] <%Chichen> THIS is why i cant enjoy this
[0:28:30] <+Fabpsi_> OH my FREAKING GOD
[0:28:31] <ergulor> the monster is here
[0:28:31] <hardin360> You can worry about Item Filters once you've decided if you want to continue playing.
[0:28:32] <Gorgs7> look at the skill forest, get in there fucker
[0:28:33] <%cobalt_phoenix_> holy shit
[0:28:35] <%CatastropheCorvid> @PatStaresAt Item Filters will make it so that only the items you want to show up will be displayed on the ground.
[0:28:35] <%baka_sugoi> T R E E
[0:28:36] <Vuilionne> loot filters hide the absolute garbage for you, so you don't pick up garbage
[0:28:37] <%JoshManVGH> FUCK!
[0:28:40] <Enn19> Just think sphere grid
[0:28:40] <DianaTheAscian> OH GOD WTF
[0:28:40] <%Man_in_the_Red> if you need guidance, use the search bar @PatStaresAt
[0:28:40] <%Chichen> THIS made me quit three times
[0:28:41] <%JoshManVGH> How!?
[0:28:42] <cartakus> CTHULHU
[0:28:42] <FassieFons> lotsa character building depth on this one, much like Kingmaker/WotR
[0:28:43] <%Birdigalore> Oh god it's worse than the sphere grid!
[0:28:43] <+SenorCounter> get a filter
[0:28:43] <%Aeogard> and this is where i bounced last time LMAO
[0:28:48] <+JackDemon316> FK THIS TREE
[0:28:49] <+Fabpsi_> that is not a tree that is a universe
[0:28:52] <+Rutheniel> how many skill trees have their own search bar?
[0:28:57] <%JoshManVGH> How is this usable!?
[0:29:09] <%valriot> LUL Its so much
[0:29:09] <%Chichen> this is genuinely awful
[0:29:13] <@ssjklyco> Path of Minion
[0:29:15] <tanarath> Yeah!
[0:29:15] <%Broand> And they're all on the opposite side of the tree
[0:29:16] <@Ranryu692> yeah that's Witch
[0:29:18] <knight_verse> Mind Cthulhus are being created
[0:29:20] <%CatastropheCorvid> @JoshManVGH It starts to make super sense eventually.
[0:29:23] <%baka_sugoi> is there a thief build?
[0:29:23] <%Blackmage9999> Blackmage9999 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 24 months, currently on a 24 month streak! 
[0:29:24] <%Wulfphelz> It looks like the ffx skill tree
[0:29:24] <viciousgrim> game doesn't pause when in this pat
[0:29:25] <segychan> it rules
[0:29:25] <+Fabpsi_> yea, having a search bar for a tree is already a extreme Sign
[0:29:30] <+ALazo> that's a little intimidating. Is it easy to fuck yourself over?
[0:29:31] <cartakus> Witch necromancer is fucked
[0:29:33] <DXLelouch24> If Lost Ark doesnt entertain me enough maybe ill play this alongside RE4HD mod and Halo Infinite while waiting for ER
[0:29:34] <+Fabpsi_> i mean, good that it works, but still very ....big
[0:29:36] <%Dakuu75> looks like Carlos from RE3 remake
[0:29:36] <%valriot> fuckin Hyrule Warriors DLC tier of "oh fuck oh jeez"
[0:29:41] <%doc_ock_rokc> Hey pat I just had two days off for snow (we are southern we don't have snow trucks) so I had my first break since september of last year
[0:29:44] <%CatastropheCorvid> @baka_sugoi Anything you want, damn near.
[0:29:45] <%Broand> Oh I'm actually doing a bleed build right now
[0:29:49] <%JoshManVGH> Wait is this a sphere grid that all classes use?
[0:29:52] <%CappuccinoGuil> BLEED ALL DAY
[0:29:53] <Enn19> Those BIG nodes are strong,but have drawbacks too
[0:29:54] <%Dova573> That should be called hemorrage
[0:29:59] <%Breaknoon> moar bleed
[0:30:00] <segychan> I'm doing cold dot
[0:30:03] <+Rutheniel> It is absolutely a sphere grid
[0:30:05] <Enn19> @JoshManVGH Yes
[0:30:06] <%Man_in_the_Red> it is in fact a full ass sphere grid
[0:30:07] <%baka_sugoi> @baka_sugoi PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[0:30:07] <%CatastropheCorvid> JoshMan, Yeah
[0:30:08] <%cobalt_phoenix_> so how long does it take to actually fill most of this?
[0:30:10] <derekpwns> dude this talent tree is radiculous
[0:30:20] <+Rutheniel> @cobalt_phoenix_ You don't
[0:30:22] <EASrake> Damage over time nodes also effect bleed
[0:30:24] <%Dakuu75> Everyone loves a sphere grid
[0:30:26] <%JoshManVGH> Ok that makes WAY more sense now
[0:30:30] <FassieFons> it's an orb grid
[0:30:30] <CruxAustralis> you don't fill the whole tree
[0:30:33] <CruxAustralis> it's limited
[0:30:34] <+UltraViolet371> good job on using the tree, you're doing great
[0:30:34] <+Rutheniel> You only get 128 points, you make the most of them
[0:30:35] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @cobalt_phoenix_ how much can you fill?
[0:30:35] <+SmigGames> I'd spend hours looking at this
[0:30:37] <cartakus> Yeah fuck it I'm gonna copy from the internet lol
[0:30:38] <+JackDemon316> I @ALazo yes you can easily ruin your build if you havnt build a character before in this game
[0:30:51] <%Dakuu75> is Pat playing in Hardcore or normal league?
[0:30:52] <Enn19> It can get NUTTY
[0:30:52] <@Moobot> Hey everybody, if you wanna check out Path of Exile's new Siege of the Atlas expansion go ahead and click this link! https://i.try.games/path-of-exile-3-17/xdp9ne
[0:30:56] <%PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Oh, I hate it
[0:31:00] <segychan> forever
[0:31:01] <DXLelouch24> @cartakus its reccomended
[0:31:06] <BepBepAmShep> Blood stance is an aura skill you can get later.  Don't worry about it right now.
[0:31:06] <ergulor> oh for sure
[0:31:07] <%cobalt_phoenix_> oh god only one 128? nope
[0:31:07] <+killer_squid1990> It's very expensive though
[0:31:11] <%JoshManVGH> Ooooooh that's good
[0:31:11] <%Ashrox117> Looks like theres a couple builds
[0:31:12] <Esipode> Pat I have played almost 5000 hours and have only ever used like half of the available skills in the game
[0:31:12] <%Treuan> Blood Stance is part of the Blood and Sand skill, I think. It's like stance switching
[0:31:12] <retrosadness> please do not try making your own builds if you're new you WILL make some garbo
[0:31:14] <jeppeww> killock the hillock
[0:31:15] <%Birdigalore> Is it possible to make a scuffed build or is everything viable lol
[0:31:19] <urkleturtle> bleeding damage scales off the inital hit, so phys damage is also decent to invest into for bleed
[0:31:26] <segychan> there's a respec currency
[0:31:28] <XelanArdel> I end up using guides most of the time since I end up building into a corner that just gets me killed later
[0:31:29] <derekpwns> pat did you look a build already
[0:31:38] <%Dakuu75> what if you forget to keep an eye on your hp
[0:31:38] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[0:31:41] <derekpwns> look up
[0:31:42] <%JoshManVGH> How's the controller support?
[0:31:44] <+Rutheniel> You get 20ish respec points by doing the acts, more requires getting additional currency.
[0:31:44] <%zacyzacyz> grats
[0:31:45] <%Man_in_the_Red> you can absolutely make a scuffed build, but if you just want to play through the campaign anything'll work
[0:31:52] <+Aikao> Okay so is respeccing easy and not limited?
[0:31:54] <+demon1103> To any who regularly play, is the respec still garbage, or is it not a giant chore?
[0:31:57] <+gatdragon> Wait is this at the start?
[0:32:05] <%Chichen> dual wield?
[0:32:06] <+Rutheniel> Sockets ain't linked!
[0:32:06] <segychan> yes
[0:32:07] <urkleturtle> you can complete the campaign with any build. but the endgame can become impossible with a scuffed build
[0:32:07] <%Chichen> if you can?
[0:32:08] <jeppeww> too dumb for the robe
[0:32:13] <%zacyzacyz> the red means you gotta identify
[0:32:15] <%Birdigalore> @PatStaresAt So if every class can dip into the whole tree, is there anything that makes each class unique?
[0:32:18] <Enn19> Correct
[0:32:19] <ergulor> you can double hand it tho
[0:32:20] <knuttifrutti> @gatdragon yeah
[0:32:24] <hardin360> @PatStaresAt Pat, one thing about bleed. Just raw increased attack damage does not increase bleed damage. Increased Ailment damage, increased physical damage do.
[0:32:26] <DXLelouch24> Chat can i use controller and not have problems later?
[0:32:27] <%eremital> eremital subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 3 month streak! smile
[0:32:31] <%Broand> There is no deckard cain
[0:32:35] <+Rutheniel> @Birdigalore Each class has three unique prestige classes
[0:32:35] <%Chichen> @PatStaresAt can you use knife in other hand?
[0:32:42] <EASrake> emergent gameplay
[0:32:51] <cartakus> @birdigalore late game new small tree
[0:32:59] <jeppeww> you attack faster if you dual wield
[0:33:00] <$RedBandolier> @DXLelouch24 yeah there's a console version, dunno if controller works on pc tho
[0:33:01] <%Birdigalore> Thanks folks!
[0:33:09] <$ArcanumArcanum> twin strike you attack once with both weapons instead of twice with one weapon
[0:33:14] <Enn19> @Birdigalore Yes! Acendancies,3 different ones for each character that can support your playstyle,can only pick one tho
[0:33:14] <butthurtdave> i'm surprised the currency stuff in this game doesnt make your mind goblins rage pat
[0:33:16] <$ArcanumArcanum> dual wielding increases attack speed by a bit I think?
[0:33:21] <Enn19> Yeah LUL
[0:33:23] <Ironveth> @birdigalore the classes starting point on the tree heavily affects how efficiently they can be certain archetypes. For instance the marauder is gonna have a bad time accessing spell nodes.
[0:33:25] <jeppeww> you get 15% block chance, and 10% more attack speed if you dual wield
[0:33:34] <+WhiteClaudiaMk> no controller support on pc last time I checked
[0:33:36] <ergulor> yes and their microtransactions
[0:33:37] <+Rutheniel> @PatStaresAt The way it works is that two handed is for BIG damage, sword and board is defensive, and dual wielding is the middle ground
[0:33:41] <+The_Timo> you can search dual wielding in the tree
[0:33:42] <%CatastropheCorvid> @PatStaresAt Hold alt while hovering over the gem for more info
[0:33:50] <@PeachSaliva> 193 raiders from PeachSaliva have joined!

[0:34:50] <%Broand> The voice acting is pretty good in this game

[0:35:09] <segychan> there so much of it too
[0:35:13] <FassieFons> shiny neon cosmetics that undermine the native art direction, hooray

[0:35:30] <chowndawg> yes
[0:35:39] <%Bearded_mushrum> Bearded_mushrum subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months! thanks for stream
[0:35:53] <Enn19> Reading the gems carefully REALLY helps
[0:35:56] <%Broand> Stances are a thing you get access to later
[0:36:00] <+Rutheniel> Blood and Sand Stance is a gem you get later
[0:36:04] <%JoshManVGH> Active skills being Materia is fucking wild, I'm so excited
[0:36:05] <derekpwns> iablo 3 wasn't trying to be like Diablo 2
[0:36:09] <Enn19> Tons of text aaaaaa
[0:36:17] <+PrimalDweeb> @RexSurname Sort of, he had mind goblins before; but now he's Strong Pat.
[0:36:20] <%zacyzacyz> cleave i think?
[0:36:21] <%TheHateFish> That Blood Stance one
[0:36:22] <+Rutheniel> Splitting Steel is cool
[0:36:24] <segychan> you can buy them all
[0:36:25] <godlesscruelty> split steel
[0:36:25] <%Dova573> Spikes sound cool
[0:36:25] <+Mattismen> Whichever sounds cooler
[0:36:25] <AntlerNoodle> What do you want to play?
[0:36:25] <%vivaldiva> cleave is fine for now
[0:36:27] <applespearsoranges> Cleave is just the simplest
[0:36:28] <hardin360> Splitting Steels is good leveling skill
[0:36:28] <ergulor> cleave is easy
[0:36:32] <%zenraider> 5
[0:36:33] <cpt_langosta> do the one with the lobster on it
[0:36:33] <%Man_in_the_Red> all of them are preeety good
[0:36:34] <1matheuw> get the one that kills things
[0:36:35] <%Broand> You can get the others from the sad looking lady
[0:36:36] <FassieFons> stance is a good neutral choice
[0:36:40] <$ArcanumArcanum> cleave is a good starter. splitting steel also good
[0:36:42] <$RedBandolier> molten strike is neat
[0:36:44] <AnnoyedApricot> you can buy the others after
[0:36:45] <applespearsoranges> Splitting Steel is bouncing weapon throw essentially
[0:36:46] <Karhax> you can buy all skills later by the way
[0:36:49] <%Man_in_the_Red> if anything you can buy all of em
[0:36:49] <%Dova573> Or you can get an item with different colors
[0:36:50] <+Ricky_Nuggets> It's  Not-Diablo! I love this game!
[0:36:50] <RAH001> Wuts ever u fancy
[0:36:51] <%epide> green is dex i belive and red is str

[0:42:15] <%king_wragles> Did you try soaking in soap water?
[0:42:23] <Enn19> She LOVES skeleton builds
[0:42:39] <%Broand> Skeleton builds in this game is fun
[0:42:46] <tanarath> yeah, it's for skeleton
[0:42:46] <Ell1ot> she had a harem of zombois
[0:42:47] <%Ashrox117> That happened to me with the grease from Morning Star Chikn Patties. Fucking permanent somehow
[0:42:49] <+Rutheniel> BOOK means LORE
[0:42:49] <%Broand> Book is lore
[0:42:51] <1matheuw> did she got to use skeletons tho?
[0:42:55] <%Man_in_the_Red> skeletons here leave something to be desire since they crumble after a bit
[0:42:56] <chowndawg> Skeleton might be the best build this league
[0:42:58] <%cade_calrayn> she got to fill the necromancer need that she can't get from D&D cause no one will play with her
[0:42:58] <+SenorCounter> get a pot of water & baking soda and dunk the pan in it. bowl gir while then scrub the pan
[0:42:59] <+Local16> Playing Skelly bomb right now funnily enough
[0:43:09] <Zourath> PoE skeletons are some of the best minion builds in the game, currently.
[0:43:12] <+mecha_11> Doesn't this game have demon agitating moments?
[0:43:16] <TheeRabbi> You look like a LARPer
[0:43:17] <ergulor> not at all
[0:43:21] <AntlerNoodle> At level 68, you'll have a bucket on your head

[0:43:54] <1matheuw> FEET
[0:44:01] <+Mattismen> Could be worse. Could be yoour OTHER mouth.
[0:44:04] <Ell1ot> voice mouth implies you have other mouths for other things
[0:44:07] <%Dakuu75> oh god... we going back to the feet-id pool all over again
[0:44:08] <%shurtal> feet-id

[0:44:26] <tanarath> Pat, going in Paige's footsteps, and finding feet
[0:44:36] <%Dakuu75> just click those everytime
[0:44:37] <%Broand> better but costs more mana
[0:44:37] <Enn19> Stronger,but also costs more and stat requirements go up
[0:44:40] <1matheuw> and uses more mana
[0:44:42] <Sunstalker> What kind of animals can druid builds get?
[0:45:14] <%Broand> How do we tell him that there isn't a better wat

[0:45:16] <+Rutheniel> @Sunstalker You can get a rhoa, a dropbear, or a snake, among other things
[0:45:20] <cpt_langosta> these crabs are pretty good, but they'd be improved with the repetitions of "NOW YOU FUCKED UP"
[0:45:26] <tanarath> There's a ui option to have loot always show up
[0:45:27] <%Dova573> Dont be stingy with drinking your potions
[0:45:38] <Enn19> If you need help there's a lil blinking button next to your skills
[0:45:41] <+SenorCounter> Get a filter @patstaresat you'll appreciate it later.

[0:46:13] <Enn19> Items are CURRENCY in this
[0:46:14] <%pectusumbra> those items are currency in this game as well
[0:46:17] <$RedBandolier> ENTER the orb economy
[0:46:21] <Zourath> @cpt_langosta Believe me, the NOW YOU FUCKED UP crabs exist, and are some of the best spectre minions in the game.

[0:46:55] <+Rutheniel> @Sunstalker You can be a crab and give yourself crab barriers, or give yourself ghost crabs
[0:47:04] <1matheuw> do you think so?
[0:47:12] <Ell1ot> big number?
[0:47:13] <PunishedMercer_> you could add your bleed to your aoe by putting them in your boots, if that's what you want.
[0:47:19] <+WhiteClaudiaMk> does superior rusted mean more or less rusted

[0:47:34] <%SaiyanShoto> Aren’t you always bitching about Destiny?
[0:47:39] <1matheuw> it means the rust does more money
[0:47:44] <%SovPho> It's a power fantasy about being a super powerful shithead that just kills anything in front of them.
[0:47:48] <knight_verse> Interesting that the loot on this game isn't  triggering you like the loot in Nioh.
[0:48:00] <cpt_langosta> pat, your dick and balls don't count as cleaning products
[0:48:00] <%croxeye> Yeah we can hear Paige
[0:48:00] <%king_wragles> Can kinda hear Paige ya
[0:48:00] <%cade_calrayn> we cannot hear her at all
[0:48:04] <whittacre> I heard page
[0:48:08] <whittacre> *Paige
[0:48:09] <%Ashrox117> Heard, “Can you hear me?”
[0:48:14] <%cade_calrayn> we only heard "Can you hear me?"
[0:48:16] <%cade_calrayn> that's all
[0:48:16] <@Ranryu692> I heard "can you hear me?" but that was the only thing I've heard from her
[0:48:18] <+Mattismen> heard her once
[0:48:20] <%cade_calrayn> it sounds like you're just talking to yourself
[0:48:21] <%RealThiele> 50% hearing
[0:48:23] <%SovPho> @knight_verse It's insanely easy to just sell your inventory, unlike it is in Nioh. Also small inventory space.
[0:48:28] <Enn19> YELLOW ITEM YELLOW GOOD
[0:48:32] <+Rutheniel> It's rare, uniques are orange
[0:48:36] <whittacre> can't see her so I can only kind of hear her
[0:48:40] <%Sotetsu> I dunno if not hearing Gief is worth not hearing Paige.
[0:48:46] <%RealThiele> tower shield LUL
[0:48:56] <Enn19> Got more mods on it

[0:49:29] <TheeRabbi> Dunno, I like that my death will be a perma one
[0:49:29] <%CappuccinoGuil> Okay, so on a scale of 1 to 10, how much has this game gotten Pat?
[0:49:42] <knight_verse> @sovpho Having played both, I disagree, this game gets just as bothersome later on with the loot clutter, I would say that they are about the same.
[0:49:43] <+PrimalDweeb> Is she distracting you with her tits?
[0:49:47] <%RealThiele> 3/10
[0:49:47] <%Dova573> Pat your boots have two chain red slots, so you add bleed to your skill
[0:49:50] <Aixenn> Hey Pat, just dropping in. I love seeing you play my favorite game. Hows the build going so far? c;
[0:49:51] <Enn19> Seems high,if he can overcome the skill tree goblins

[0:50:17] <+Rutheniel> You can also buy a second bleed support from Nessa back in town
[0:50:20] <+PrimalDweeb> No, wait; she was distracting you with her feet, wasn't she?!
[0:50:21] <TheeRabbi> I love watching Pat Misunderstands At
[0:50:22] <%RealThiele> mostly self-inflicted
[0:50:26] <%SovPho> @knight_verse easiest counter point is the existence of loot filters
[0:50:42] <Aixenn> Pat you can turn on Sockets always on in the settings
[0:51:00] <RAH001> “ quit it, ur embarrassing me right in front of my sponsors “

[0:51:48] <Aixenn> PAt looks like hes ready to build Toxic Rain Champion

[0:52:38] <Ell1ot> don't even slice the salami. just shove the whole thing in
[0:52:40] <codepoke> nothing until level 60 where you start losing exp
[0:52:41] <chowndawg> exp later on
[0:52:41] <tubit> you lose xp when you're high enough level

[0:53:04] <FassieFons> no
[0:53:05] <Ian_does> no
[0:53:07] <ergulor> no
[0:53:14] <Zourath> Yes
[0:53:14] <%Ashrox117> On hardcore, your character
[0:53:14] <%Bluwizard21> It cost you nothing, EXCEPT YOUR GOLD AND WEAPONS!- thank you dark dungeons
[0:53:16] <tanarath> Yep!
[0:53:16] <+tigerstyle96> No
[0:53:20] <Zourath> But manually
[0:53:22] <cpt_langosta> egg
[0:53:23] <+Rutheniel> You can actually delevel yourself with an item though, for Reasons
[0:53:24] <Aixenn> Really love until you get to the really high level and your talking about losing a million XP per death
[0:53:25] <%valcheese> gross
[0:53:29] <1matheuw> but you can lose like 15 minutes of grind on the later levels
[0:53:31] <chowndawg> it was brutal in ffxi
[0:53:31] <Karhax> stop picking up white items
[0:53:32] <%SovPho> You can't delevel. But after act 5 your resistances get fucking nerfed to shit so if you have no resistances to have -30% to everything and are a wet tissue.
[0:53:33] <tanarath> Portal
[0:53:35] <knight_verse> Run back and sell it.
[0:53:36] <%Dova573> Time to play attache case
[0:53:37] <+kickaxe88> The exp loss isn't all that bad until you get to the high 80's and up, then it sucks
[0:53:43] <+Local16> Deleveling in XI was amazing
[0:53:46] <tanarath> Or use a waystone
[0:53:48] <%Broand> That's rare, unique is its own thing
[0:53:52] <DianaTheAscian> did you know that FFXI is free if you pay for it?
[0:53:54] <%SovPho> Unique is orange, rare is yellow.
[0:53:54] <%RealThiele> and now the goblins creep in
[0:53:58] <EASrake> yellows are rare
[0:54:00] <%Dova573> gold though
[0:54:01] <+Rutheniel> It's rare, not unique Pat
[0:54:02] <%Man_in_the_Red> welp, if pats gonna be like this with act 1 gear he might need that filter bad
[0:54:05] <ergulor> hold shif to compare
[0:54:06] <knight_verse> Here we go.
[0:54:08] <+Rutheniel> Resistances are SUPER important though
[0:54:12] <+ShinobiAJ> the new one is better
[0:54:12] <%valcheese> what is the rate of heal?
[0:54:14] <AnnoyedApricot> life and resists are what you want

[0:59:17] <+goney> 10
[0:59:17] <%barrakuta371> Attack it's weak point for massive famage
[0:59:18] <+ShinobiAJ> they added 5 acts in one expansion
[0:59:19] <%valcheese> wow
[0:59:21] <%Bluwizard21> enough for some act10on
[0:59:22] <ergulor> 10
[0:59:22] <%SovPho> They added them relatively slowly to flesh the game out.
[0:59:23] <+ReallyBigRocks> you don't need to worry about that until act 54
[0:59:23] <%CatastropheCorvid> 10 and a craptonne of endgame
[0:59:27] <BepBepAmShep> plus a lot of post-act 10 content
[0:59:29] <Zourath> 10
[0:59:29] <chowndawg> they added 6 acts in one patch
[0:59:30] <Karhax> and after the acts there are maps
[0:59:30] <%SovPho> 2 more acts
[0:59:31] <1matheuw> yes
[0:59:31] <segychan> endgame is huge
[0:59:31] <$vixenpunch> Just 10
[0:59:32] <ergulor> before there were 3/4 and 3 difficulties
[0:59:33] <+Rutheniel> Patch 3.0 added acts 5-10
[0:59:35] <chowndawg> you do them once
[0:59:35] <Hydrapissed> endless ACTS
[0:59:37] <dannyilhan> somehow I feel like PoE might be right up Pat's alley...
[0:59:37] <%SovPho> oh shit 7 more god damn
[0:59:38] <+SenorCounter> 10 and an epilogue
[0:59:40] <%RealThiele> they dropped the 3 acts and 3 difficulties and squished the nightmare/hell modes into a unique story
[0:59:43] <EASrake> Time is relative
[0:59:47] <chowndawg> 7 separate acts
[0:59:48] <$vixenpunch> Path of exile has most of its content dedicated to post game
[0:59:56] <EASrake> There is a post game after act 10

[1:01:05] <ergulor> thereis no money
[1:01:07] <knight_verse> Narter System
[1:01:07] <+ShinobiAJ> this game operates on the gold standard
[1:01:11] <%epide> no its the scraps
[1:01:12] <+tempestzephyr> oops no money
[1:01:13] <EASrake> @Zourath Saying it like that scare people away
[1:01:13] <Scorchfield> barter items, no gold in this game
[1:01:13] <knight_verse> Barter*
[1:01:13] <chowndawg> all money is useable

[1:01:24] <+Rutheniel> That is exactly how it is
[1:01:25] <%Felhad> u giev SoJ?
[1:01:25] <%Ashrox117> Trade is NFT based
[1:01:30] <%epide> scraps can become scrolls if i remeber right
[1:01:33] <tanarath> No, orbs or equivalent items
[1:01:34] <@Ranryu692> wow, I was about to download the game until I learned that lol
[1:01:36] <1matheuw> its lore accurate alright
[1:01:37] <tubit> NotLikeThis
[1:01:43] <Calamity2007> This barter feels very MMO appropriate though
[1:01:43] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[1:01:48] <%RealThiele> WTS Tabula Rasa 25c
[1:01:54] <%CappuccinoGuil> Or rainy
[1:01:56] <+Arminscc> You need to mint the scrolls to sell them
[1:01:59] <XelanArdel> having your inventory overloaded with currency items is why the premium stash tabs are neccesary
[1:01:59] <Calamity2007> I want to try this game but it also scares me
[1:02:00] <%Valison> @PatStaresAt Chaos orbs are the standard currency for trading
[1:02:03] <sirrice77> Money? Theres no money. Certain items are “currency”. Trade is done with the rarest of these and with other items
[1:02:12] <%CappuccinoGuil> PAT! You're influencing me to play this game, HOW DARE YOU???

[1:03:19] <+bugz_munny> it gets a new one every 3 months
[1:03:20] <%RealThiele> it sure is
[1:03:20] <+ShinobiAJ> this is by far the most complex rpg ive ever played
[1:03:21] <+PrimalDweeb> Sounds like a mind goblin for me
[1:03:22] <cartakus> FREE TO PLAY
[1:03:22] <ergulor> no infinity but there are a lot of reicpes
[1:03:23] <%RealThiele> they sell storage
[1:03:24] <+JackDemon316> yes
[1:03:28] <%Broand> Do you wanna see what a unique looks like?
[1:03:29] <+ShinobiAJ> the vendor is the horadric cube
[1:03:30] <%Aeogard> yeppers
[1:03:33] <sirrice77> Vendor recipes are super useful
[1:03:35] <ergulor> no, there is another way to craft
[1:03:40] <%Ashrox117> It’s like riding a sword down a tapestry but torso
[1:03:41] <chowndawg> crafting is something else
[1:03:42] <segychan> crafting material is currency
[1:03:57] <ohno58> The crabs are rising up
[1:04:04] <$vixenpunch> Crafting is adding mods to an item of your choosing/ using currency to randomly add mods

[1:04:15] <tanarath> Pat, you thought the skill forest was the gobolin, when it was the System Forest that is the real challenge! (seriously, though, it's not that bad)
[1:04:17] <%epide> pat made a crabie patty
[1:04:17] <Zourath> There's like, 4-5 crafting systems.
[1:04:19] <+Gorgonson> cum has removed the eternal stain...
[1:04:20] <Gelphaze> Killer CRABS!
[1:04:26] <$vixenpunch> Good crafting is basically an order of operations that ups your odds for a good set of mods
[1:04:43] <%RealThiele> poe . trade is the real shit
[1:04:46] <cpt_langosta> cannibal says "no reading for you"
[1:04:50] <$vixenpunch> Usually you wanna start with a base item that already has stuff you want and empty slots to craft on to
[1:05:00] <+Rutheniel> Pat to put it in perspective: This game has been doing a league every three months, doing a new mechanic each time, that eventually goes into the core game, since 2013.

[1:07:12] <%cade_calrayn> pondering your own orb? On stream? isn't that against ToS?
[1:07:29] <chowndawg> they specifically went and made the hit effects better in a patch
[1:07:40] <+Rutheniel> You can get the skills he is using against you by the way
[1:07:46] <segychan> vendors in town

[1:08:02] <blowfishchunky> this looks a lot like Diablo
[1:08:16] <%Felhad> aww, 5 more days for console
[1:08:22] <hardin360> @PatStaresAt Reward for a quest in the next zone is a skill called Blood and Sand. It will allow you to switch modes with the skill you're using. Sand version has better AoE.
[1:08:30] <%CalderGaming> A driftwood sceptre~ Come ride heroes ride~
[1:08:36] <blowfishchunky> so I think I'll like it
[1:08:38] <%RealThiele> this was the Kiwi response to Diablo 3

[1:09:05] <%pectusumbra> I means she's whipping your ass
[1:09:33] <%epide> better dolfin
[1:09:43] <%RealThiele> this game doesnt have the history of diablos story but its not bad and the game length is longer than D3
[1:09:48] <tanarath> Longer
[1:09:49] <Latija> that dagger rules

[1:10:07] <tanarath> Also, the story just better.
[1:10:07] <%Man_in_the_Red> god, the +1 level mods being in the core mod pool kicks ass
[1:10:10] <ergulor> you cannot use oerforate with daggers

[1:13:09] <%SovPho> Quicksilver will always give what quicksilver gives unless you get a magic version of it, rather than replacing it every 5 levels.
[1:13:10] <%Broand> Ancestral call
[1:13:19] <%epide> whats pats class?
[1:13:37] <%RealThiele> pat is Dex/STR hybrid starting on the wheel
[1:13:37] <@Moobot> Hey everybody, if you wanna check out Path of Exile's new Siege of the Atlas expansion go ahead and click this link! https://i.try.games/path-of-exile-3-17/xdp9ne
[1:13:43] <%epide> thats a good one
[1:13:55] <cpt_langosta> pat has no class
[1:14:04] <%Broand> Frost blades is a fun time
[1:14:08] <segychan> sell your shit
[1:14:09] <irziggo> frost blades is fun
[1:14:10] <%Broand> Sell some junk
[1:14:15] <%epide> i mean what did he start with
[1:14:21] <segychan> shift click
[1:14:29] <+m3chamike> duelist
[1:14:32] <%Man_in_the_Red> pat's duelist
[1:14:42] <+doe3879> Sell the ORB of Tramutation
[1:14:44] <%epide> ah ok thx
[1:14:51] <$realm_forge> Oh god there’s an attaché case
[1:15:05] <%Broand> It's generally not worth it to pick up white gear and sell it, wisdom scrolls drop often enough
[1:15:12] <%Man_in_the_Red> @PatStaresAt if need be you can use your transmutes for easy wisdoms
[1:15:17] <%RealThiele> GGG makes their money by selling Attache cases
[1:15:45] <segychan> not bigger ones, bigger stash tabs
[1:15:57] <hardin360> Onslaught to replace double strike might be to your liking Pat.
[1:15:59] <%The_Angry_God_Hoogs> The_Angry_God_Hoogs subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! hi
[1:16:18] <+triage0> put your extra stuff in the stash pat
[1:16:21] <%TheHateFish> He doesn't have Onslaught, kids
[1:16:23] <chowndawg> turn visible sockets on
[1:16:24] <%Broand> It's another support gem
[1:16:26] <+doe3879> you are GOOD
[1:16:28] <+doe3879> to go
[1:16:28] <$realm_forge> I torn on this game because I love looter games but the top down perspectives
[1:16:28] <%Broand> But you're good
[1:16:33] <+sasparillatango> onslaught is a buff that gives 20% atk/cast/move speed
[1:16:44] <segychan> there's an option in settings to always show gem sockets on your items
[1:16:46] <Zrams3y> Onslaught support is the gem you would look for- you don't have it, don't worry about it for now
[1:16:49] <%valcheese> \
[1:17:02] <%cade_calrayn> to the Feet-Id Pool, as Paige pronounced it
[1:17:08] <%RealThiele> into the woolie hole
[1:17:15] <+Rutheniel> Yeah, Wraeclast is Fantasy Australia
[1:17:19] <cpt_langosta> aw, sick, i love fetid pool!
[1:17:21] <+Rutheniel> Shit SUCKS
[1:17:23] <ergulor> yeah wraeclasts sucks
[1:17:23] <%Broand> Yeah wraeclast is kind of a shithole
[1:18:02] <%Broand> No wait it's ok
[1:18:02] <%UvBenServed> NotLikeThis
[1:18:03] <ashuckel> you can use more generic stuff like attacks
[1:18:04] <cpt_langosta> pump dex for the true path of dexile
[1:18:06] <%pectusumbra> cold is going to be magic user stuff I want to say. Witch in particular
[1:18:12] <%Broand> It's physical damage converted to col
[1:18:15] <+doe3879> cold is "elemental"
[1:18:16] <+sasparillatango> there's a reason exiles are sent to wraeclast
[1:18:18] <+Rutheniel> Yeah but frost blade converts from physical damage, so physical damage increases your damage too
[1:18:48] <applespearsoranges> Most skills have multiple scaling parameters
[1:18:51] <+Red_Lanyard> God, after all this time the skill screen from this game still gives me anxiety
[1:18:55] <hardin360> You dont need increased cold to scale frost blades. Attack damage and generic elemental as well as weapon specific increases will work.
[1:18:59] <%Broand> Type in "One"
[1:19:04] <chowndawg> frost blades is also melee and an attack
[1:19:06] <ergulor> checl mopre to the right
[1:19:06] <%Ascethetic> you def want to buff your resistances though
[1:19:07] <%RealThiele> chain and cloth Kreygasm
[1:19:12] <hardin360> Projectile damage as well
[1:19:18] <%TheHateFish> Keystone passives are major gameplay style changes
[1:19:29] <chowndawg> that's a lie
[1:19:56] <%Ashrox117> Wow, blunderbuss knife
[1:19:57] <+Rutheniel> its a big old bird
[1:19:57] <%RealThiele> +projectile+ pierce nuke da planet
[1:20:31] <+WhiteClaudiaMk> dps race
[1:21:05] <%pectusumbra> just keep killing and smashing. you'll get there
[1:21:05] <@Moobot> Hey everybody, if you wanna check out Path of Exile's new Siege of the Atlas expansion go ahead and click this link! https://i.try.games/path-of-exile-3-17/xdp9ne
[1:21:06] <$ArcanumArcanum> you can sell Orbs of Transmutation to get ID scrolls
[1:21:14] <+Rutheniel> The larger currencies vendor for more scrolls
[1:21:19] <+ShinobiAJ> if you vendor armor scraps and blacksmiths whetstones they give multiple scrolls each
[1:21:38] <%epide> right click the scraps i think that makes them scrolls if i rember bin awile
[1:21:45] <%Ashrox117> What was that red phantom stand looking thing ?
[1:21:47] <cpt_langosta> you know what else has excellent feedback? the critically acclaimed masterpiece Microsoft Bob.
[1:21:58] <+SenorCounter> @PatStaresAt You should considering getting a loot filter. Sometimes way to much drops, where you really only want to see valuable items
[1:22:02] <%JoshManVGH> You where splashing blood, I dosed off, and now you're stabbing lasers? What a game!
[1:22:04] <+Rutheniel> The stand is ancestral call support
[1:22:04] <%Broand> Ancestral call
[1:22:05] <Manwad> You can also vendor rare items to get transmute orbs, which then can be vendored for scrolls
[1:22:06] <hardin360> Ancestral Call
[1:22:07] <+SenorCounter> That the support skill you put in
[1:22:10] <%king_wragles> Cursed bloodline
[1:22:10] <+A0N33> That's Ancestral Call
[1:22:11] <+ShinobiAJ> thats the support gem ancestral ccall
[1:22:12] <ergulor> one of your support gems
[1:22:12] <Karhax> that's the ancestral call support
[1:22:16] <%RealThiele> ancentral spirit support
[1:22:16] <%Ashrox117> Ahhh
[1:22:27] <+ShinobiAJ> anctral call with frost blades is amazing by the way
[1:22:37] <+robert_edwards> Not stashing currencies gives me anxiety LUL
[1:22:41] <%RealThiele> sash :o
[1:22:43] <ergulor> that's why you need a lootfilter to remove the crap
[1:22:44] <Karhax> nah, you are drowning in garbage
[1:22:56] <%Ashrox117> On the stand note, your character sounds like the VA for Joseph Joestar
[1:23:09] <+sasparillatango> learn to ignore shit
[1:23:20] <%RealThiele> quicksilver time
[1:23:20] <+SenorCounter> Get a filter
[1:23:28] <jorniev> is this game fun?
[1:23:29] <+sasparillatango> there's a reason item filters exist in this game
[1:23:29] <+SenorCounter> That way you don't have to ignore, it does it for you.
[1:23:31] <@PrefectusCorgi> Never Ingore
[1:23:31] <+ShinobiAJ> pick up every item you see dont believe their lies
[1:23:32] <+Rutheniel> A loot filter allows you to ignore shit for you
[1:23:33] <tanarath> Collect everything
[1:23:35] <%Broand> There are multiple inventories of gear  in each zone
[1:23:43] <%RealThiele> use your speed flask then
[1:23:51] <Ozmodyas> This is THE game that requires you to ignore shit
[1:24:10] <tanarath> Btw, each character has something that to say about each quest if you ask them.
[1:24:14] <jorniev> is this a goblin episode?
[1:24:23] <ashuckel> it won't happen early, but this is the kind of game that will fill your entire inventory at least 20x per zone if you were to pick everything up
[1:24:41] <Ozmodyas> The most important add on is a thing that ignores shit for you in fact
[1:24:45] <MidnightPacif1c> @jorniev unofficially yes
[1:24:54] <+SenorCounter> @PatStaresAt hold shift with the scrolls
[1:25:21] <%RealThiele> GOOD RING
[1:25:32] <%TheHateFish> You got an Amulet as well
[1:25:58] <jorniev> is this the game with the HUUUGE level up screen?
[1:26:07] <%RealThiele> ok with the mana and life on kill you are set for FB now
[1:26:21] <+Rutheniel> Or you curate it yourself
[1:26:21] <AnnoyedApricot> at the endgame it becomes kinda unplayable without the loot filter
[1:26:21] <%TheHateFish> @jorniev The one you've seen is one of three
[1:26:22] <%Man_in_the_Red> yep
[1:26:26] <ergulor> you use neversink's
[1:26:28] <tanarath> Kinda
[1:26:29] <ergulor> no
[1:26:29] <LoneFonte> @jorniev yeap
[1:26:30] <%SovPho> There's a website where you can just set one up
[1:26:36] <chowndawg> essentailly
[1:26:37] <Karhax> nah, you use a general one that removes complete garbage
[1:26:38] <%KingShadowCB> that identify noise reminded me of Fate, remember Fate?'
[1:26:43] <+WhiteClaudiaMk> you'll learn what to ignore, then you'll set it up
[1:26:46] <+ShinobiAJ> most people use neversinks loot filter
[1:26:46] <%JoshManVGH> Shield!?
[1:26:49] <%pectusumbra> you have a level looks like
[1:27:00] <jorniev> daaaaamn I hope it's at least less threatening than it looks like
[1:27:01] <+sasparillatango> filterblade from neversink -- legitamtely the best fan made website for a 3rd party tool ever made
[1:27:11] <ergulor> yes
[1:27:18] <+SenorCounter> @sasparillatango yup
[1:27:19] <%CalderGaming> dnoOOO
[1:27:20] <@Ranryu692> maybe they're dinosaurs?
[1:27:21] <ergulor> they're like casuaries
[1:27:21] <%GinAndRoses> evil featherless ostrich
[1:27:24] <ashuckel> you can turn on enemies health bar on top of their heads to make it easier to know how much damage you are doing to a whole group
[1:27:26] <cpt_langosta> some birds aren't birds, pat, get used to it
[1:27:31] <ergulor> or whatever you call those killer birds
[1:27:38] <tanarath> They're horrifying monsters that are evolutionarily closest to birds.
[1:27:38] <chowndawg> cassowary
[1:27:41] <+Rutheniel> They're supposed to be analogues to Moa birds, hence the name
[1:28:00] <%SovPho> It's because you're using frost damage on an elemental resist dude
[1:28:03] <%RealThiele> monster has many orbs
[1:28:03] <Manwad> that's the league mechanic isn't he
[1:28:15] <%pectusumbra> that's shield
[1:28:15] <@Moobot> Hey everybody, if you wanna check out Path of Exile's new Siege of the Atlas expansion go ahead and click this link! https://i.try.games/path-of-exile-3-17/xdp9ne
[1:28:18] <+SenorCounter> Shield
[1:28:19] <$scallycap> shield, like Master Chief
[1:28:20] <ashuckel> Energy Shield
[1:28:20] <Zombrocom> Energy shield
[1:28:20] <AnnoyedApricot> that's energy shield
[1:28:20] <%SovPho> Shield
[1:28:21] <%king_wragles> Shield?
[1:28:22] <%UvBenServed> Shield?
[1:28:22] <%TheHateFish> Energy Shield
[1:28:23] <librettodude> blue is energy shield
[1:28:23] <Vuilionne> energy shield
[1:28:24] <ergulor> energy shield
[1:28:25] <%epide> its p shild
[1:28:26] <%Broand> That's one of the 3 defense mechanics, called energy shield, it's from your chest
[1:28:27] <+Rutheniel> Because you are wearing energy shield gear
[1:28:28] <%epide> hp
[1:28:30] <%RealThiele> your chest has energy shield
[1:28:40] <%JoshManVGH> It looks like you have a power shiled
[1:28:53] <$CrownlessKitty> borderlands shield but Magic
[1:28:57] <Ozmodyas> Blue on Health is the energy shield that regents if you stop taking damage for a bit
[1:29:09] <+Rutheniel> Energy shield is Blue Life, point for point it is the same as Red Life, but has different mechanics for regaining it
[1:29:19] <+SenorCounter> right click scroll + hold shift, you can identify multiple items
[1:29:40] <+bigslinglelino> You can toggle an option to always show gem slots when you aren’t hovering over an item btw
[1:29:42] <+Pendragon3d> playing with paige??
[1:29:52] <+Red_Lanyard> Stronk bois
[1:29:58] <+Rutheniel> To quote Wag the Dog: "You don't change horses midstream"
[1:30:01] <+wmeldrum> Just realized this game is free??? whu?
[1:30:03] <+sasparillatango> Ok chat quick question -- would you rank this as more or less complex than Wrath of the Righteous?
[1:30:15] <+Rutheniel> More
[1:30:43] <@ssjklyco> It's free and looks better than a major money pokemon
[1:30:44] <+Rutheniel> More complex because you need to stack system on top of system to get the big damage.
[1:30:46] <%CatastropheCorvid> And absolutely no P2W mechanics
[1:30:50] <%epide> its up there with warframe in quality
[1:30:51] <librettodude> PoE is kind of insane
[1:30:52] <Manwad> yeah if you plan on going hard, you need at least a currency tab
[1:30:53] <+demon1103> yes..."free"
[1:30:54] <+Rutheniel> And there are like twelve different types of endgame
[1:30:54] <ergulor> and to look less like a clown in endgame
[1:30:57] <Karhax> the currency stash tab is the only really necessary purchase in my opition
[1:31:03] <%cade_calrayn> take Peach Saliva's word for it!
[1:31:08] <Ell1ot> how many stash tabs do you start with?
[1:31:16] <Zombrocom> I have played 1688 hours of this damn game already.
[1:31:19] <AngryAsian5> Good ol' shiny hats. No one can resist them.
[1:31:20] <ergulor> 1%
[1:31:25] <Zombrocom> When the hell is POE2
[1:31:27] <librettodude> 4, and they can be per-character if you play Solo-Self-Found
[1:31:28] <%RealThiele> master is poggers
[1:31:34] <+sasparillatango> its a legit good game if you like ARPGs
[1:31:35] <Karhax> it's 1%, not 1 Pat

[1:31:43] <irziggo> for frost blades i suggest working your way up the right side of the passive tree
[1:31:44] <Zombrocom> Nah, I mean Path of Exile 2

[1:32:42] <+Rutheniel> Hey Pat, look up "Chaos Innoculation" on the skill tree when you get the chance, its pretty emblematic of "Keystone" passives.
[1:32:47] <$scallycap> level up you hoe

[1:34:37] <chowndawg> strike skills use it
[1:34:51] <+Rutheniel> @PatStaresAt There is also "Tribal Fury" on the skill tree, which gives you an ADDITIONAL guy
[1:35:19] <%RealThiele> frost blade machine gun is pretty satisfying endgame

[1:35:53] <+ShinobiAJ> you can search for strike on the tree
[1:35:57] <%CatastropheCorvid> @Rutheniel I know what you're referring to, but damn if I didn't misread that the first time.
[1:35:59] <+ShinobiAJ> yeah, tribal fury
[1:36:00] <$scallycap> try "summon"
[1:36:01] <+sasparillatango> there is one on the bottom left about strike skills hit another target, just look for --- yea they got you

[1:37:05] <%Broand> you know what they say pat? act 1-10 are the tutorial, the real game happens after
[1:37:11] <%Valison> the tribal furry
[1:37:13] <chowndawg> make sure you are using a strike skill
[1:37:15] <luciluxlu0> I haven't played this since it came on Xbox, I'm glad that it's still kicking.
[1:37:15] <%AKW4RD_BUFF4LO> OG shitheads are still here btw
[1:37:17] <+tigerstyle96> Tribal furry

[1:37:50] <+bigslinglelino> Go in so you can get the waypoint
[1:37:52] <+SenorCounter> yes
[1:37:54] <fojidoj> Does this have controller support?
[1:38:01] <chowndawg> pretty much
[1:38:07] <ergulor> @fojidoj not on pc
[1:38:12] <AnnoyedApricot> @fojidoj not on pc but there is a console version
[1:38:15] <+tigerstyle96> @fojidoj its on console so I would assume so
[1:38:17] <cpt_langosta> new man dropped
[1:38:20] <Mogel56> I love playing flicker strike duelist, literally hold 1 button and my character Weskers his way through the entire map.
[1:38:26] <chowndawg> controller support should be coming in about 3ish months maybe
[1:38:34] <%cade_calrayn> LOL

[1:38:44] <%GinAndRoses> my god
[1:38:50] <%cade_calrayn> she exploded skeletons on stream...  it was very lewd
[1:38:51] <$Mekhet09> So is this is like diablos?
[1:38:52] <cpt_langosta> if a skeleton ejaculates, is it just bone marrow?
[1:38:56] <dannyilhan> shank'd
[1:38:57] <%RealThiele> pat-uh
[1:39:15] <%CatastropheCorvid> Was he barking because he could hear himself?
[1:39:21] <+SenorCounter> @Mekhet09 It's more Diablo then diablo
[1:39:24] <%shurtal> foetid of god
[1:39:27] <Zombrocom> This game is very diablo 2, yes. It was intended as a sort of spiritual successor
[1:39:32] <librettodude> Blighttown 3.0
[1:39:40] <RAH001> He is planning
[1:39:42] <%CatastropheCorvid> @SenorCounter Diablo 3, Diablo harder.
[1:39:52] <%GinAndRoses> unfeet the pool
[1:40:00] <+tempestzephyr> feta
[1:40:03] <+Rutheniel> Never forget "Foetor"
[1:40:04] <+sasparillatango> fetid porn
[1:40:08] <%RealThiele> rub thy face upon the feet pool
[1:40:09] <%king_wragles> So feet is gonna be in the next pod cast title
[1:40:11] <librettodude> fetid fighted foetid fum
[1:40:12] <%king_wragles> Calling it now
[1:40:13] <cpt_langosta> JUST CALL IT THE FETISH POOL
[1:40:15] <%UvBenServed> Feet-tit
[1:40:26] <$realm_forge> The hentai pit
[1:40:26] <$scallycap> this is Brisbane
[1:40:27] <+sasparillatango> close, Fantasy New Zealand
[1:40:28] <%AKW4RD_BUFF4LO> Fed deez nuts
[1:40:31] <ergulor> oh is true
[1:40:33] <%CatastropheCorvid> Aus/NZ
[1:40:36] <%Bloomingzonda> Yeah Diablo 3 exists but the sequels to Diablo 2 are this and Grim Dawn
[1:40:37] <%GinAndRoses> it's made by Kiwis after all
[1:40:43] <+Rutheniel> Nah, Oriath is fantasy new zealand
[1:40:45] <chowndawg> new zealand specifically\
[1:40:45] <%vivaldiva> There's litteral drop bears later on
[1:40:46] <+sasparillatango> GGG is based out of NZ
[1:40:47] <idyota> based on the moa, an extinct bird from new zealand
[1:40:48] <%Broand> Wait until you encounter the "plummeting ursa"
[1:40:51] <fojidoj> It’s more just regular Australia
[1:40:59] <%king_wragles> If emu looked like that, I totally could understand Australia losing a war to them
[1:41:01] <+Red_Lanyard> Australia? Just one big Sunnydale
[1:41:08] <ashuckel> console and pc servers are separate
[1:41:14] <%Broand> The devs are from new zealand
[1:41:14] <ergulor> yup
[1:41:20] <ergulor> console only has 4 flask iirc
[1:41:23] <librettodude> The "It's just fantasy australia" comparison is laughably accurate
[1:41:29] <%AKW4RD_BUFF4LO> Thanks for the info Pat!
[1:41:46] <%RealThiele> CHAOS
[1:41:56] <+SenorCounter> higher quality
[1:41:57] <dannyilhan> yo Pat- would such a game be interesting to you to play in hardcore mode, or do them goblins forbid that
[1:41:59] <+Rutheniel> Hold Alt on it
[1:42:00] <+crazyspartan214> New Zealand; Britain favorite child
[1:42:00] <+sasparillatango> notice the quality is 8%
[1:42:03] <+SenorCounter> hit alt
[1:42:12] <%CatastropheCorvid> Hold ALT on gem
[1:42:12] <%RealThiele> gem quality Kappa
[1:42:18] <tanarath> Compare
[1:42:19] <%Broand> you know how gear has quality? so can skills!
[1:42:20] <@Moobot> Hey everybody, if you wanna check out Path of Exile's new Siege of the Atlas expansion go ahead and click this link! https://i.try.games/path-of-exile-3-17/xdp9ne
[1:42:20] <+SenorCounter> Hover over yours and the superior one and use alt
[1:42:25] <%TheHateFish> Pat, you've got a blue sword.
[1:42:26] <+polothegreatest> Ah NZ, LOTR land MindManners
[1:42:30] <vicar_anat> quality gives gems additional effects
[1:42:49] <ergulor> shity
[1:43:02] <sourdough_scones> you could duel weild it if you wanted to
[1:43:02] <%TheHateFish> Off-hand the dagger, main-hand the sword, use dual-strike and get Perforate back
[1:43:05] <%RealThiele> dual wield?
[1:43:05] <$realm_forge> Every ten years New Zealand is terrorized by a roaming monster known as Peter Jackson
[1:43:06] <%CatastropheCorvid> Fuck, somebody is already lvl 79
[1:43:08] <JoshGGtv> is this diable 3
[1:43:11] <%JoshManVGH> But if you give up shield?
[1:43:20] <tubit> necro guy is raising the roof
[1:43:24] <cpt_langosta> Use secondary attack of cold weapon for a heavy damage
[1:43:33] <%Broand> League mechanc
[1:43:43] <+bigslinglelino> Bro he’s running a minion build
[1:43:44] <chowndawg> league
[1:43:44] <+aWanderingKaivo> Pat playing Path of Exile? In MY twitch?
[1:43:52] <ergulor> lock
[1:43:52] <+Rutheniel> The early areas are semi randomly generated
[1:43:54] <+sasparillatango> they buffed act 1 two leagues ago and act 2 this league
[1:43:56] <librettodude> League mechanics are how they mix up early zones
[1:43:57] <%Broand> Locked in stone pretty much
[1:44:03] <+Dappercat> they redid the earlier acts a bit a couple years ago i believe
[1:44:04] <Zombrocom> Early areas don't change much. They got a little bit of a graphics upgrade but the act itself mostly hasn't changed in years/
[1:44:07] <%Man_in_the_Red> act 1 and 2 god some changes
[1:44:10] <+Dappercat> not substantially
[1:44:11] <Karhax> early areas are mostly the same but league mechanics are added
[1:44:12] <%Broand> It gets tiring doing the 10 acts every time you want to make a new character
[1:44:13] <ashuckel> early acts are not touched, for the most part, just rebalanced
[1:44:22] <chowndawg> some area are randomize layouts
[1:44:24] <Zombrocom> Act 3 got shortened a little a couple years ago which was nice
[1:44:28] <+Rutheniel> There are tells that you learn that point you which exact directions, so like, Fetid pool is always left on the map, the submerged passage is always on the right side
[1:44:46] <%epide> now u can use some magic sup gems
[1:44:56] <$scallycap> p much
[1:44:57] <+aWanderingKaivo> bigger ones do more stuff yeah generally
[1:44:57] <+sasparillatango> yes, those are "notables"
[1:44:58] <%TheHateFish> More impact it has, yeah
[1:45:01] <Mogel56> They mostly just change/remove extra tedious stuff in the early game.
[1:45:04] <ergulor> the more it changes the build
[1:45:05] <%TheHateFish> The massive ones are a paradigm shift
[1:45:13] <tanarath> The bigger effect is has, not everything is right for you.
[1:45:17] <+Rutheniel> There are small passives, notable passives, ad then keystones. Keystones alter gamepaly significantly
[1:45:24] <Karhax> bigger is more impact, there are some that have downsides if they are big
[1:45:31] <librettodude> Super Big ones are "Character Defining" since they often come with tradeoffs
[1:45:31] <%TheHateFish> INT gives you more mana
[1:45:37] <chowndawg> generally, but the biggest ones change your playstyle
[1:45:40] <+Rutheniel> Look up: "Chaos Inoculation" for an example of a gameplay change
[1:45:42] <+sasparillatango> keystones are not 'stronger' but they have gameplay changing effects -- be careful taking them
[1:45:43] <idyota> small passives, notable passives, keystones
[1:45:44] <%Broand> The thing about the biggest nodes is that they give you BIG downsides
[1:45:46] <+bigslinglelino> Definitely don’t skip out on defensive upgrades, you’ll regret it later
[1:45:46] <+aWanderingKaivo> the really big ones some times have tradeoffs and make significant changes to how your character plays
[1:45:50] <%Broand> type in Chaos Inoculation
[1:45:51] <ashuckel> big ones have bigger stats. The very large ones are build defining passives that can totally change how your character works
[1:45:59] <tanarath> There's shit that takes away your abilit to attack, makes your shield your health, etc.
[1:46:04] <%GinAndRoses> lmao
[1:46:12] <%UvBenServed> Kill all feet monsters
[1:46:19] <%JonathLP> Pat can't stop thinking about feet
[1:46:23] <%JoshManVGH> KILL EM ALL, FEATER!
[1:46:35] <chowndawg> archers get another stand
[1:46:38] <ashuckel> Kill all the "nearby" monsters
[1:46:41] <ashuckel> :)
[1:46:59] <%RealThiele> never tried ancestral call with flicker strike
[1:47:04] <+aWanderingKaivo> GRIMGRIND.
[1:47:46] <$scallycap> Pat "Iceman" Ron
[1:47:50] <%Broand> Wait until you find CHAIN Support, which makes everything that has a projectle do that
[1:47:53] <+Rutheniel> You can get a support gem that makes it chain additional times as well
[1:47:54] <%Broand> Including bow attacks!
[1:47:55] <%CatastropheCorvid> Fun Fact! Chain Lightning exists!
[1:47:59] <Zombrocom> Just wait til ya get chain support
[1:48:03] <%RealThiele> multistrike support
[1:48:06] <librettodude> when your shotgun turns people you shoot into shotguns
[1:48:17] <$RedBandolier> There's an entire stat called "Chain" that gives that property to all projectiles
[1:48:28] <%CappuccinoGuil> wait, Pat has a stand in this???
[1:48:46] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt But did they change it to Wumbo when spongebob came out?
[1:48:47] <xiccy> what class is he, duelist?
[1:48:48] <cpt_langosta> sun turned on
[1:48:49] <%GinAndRoses> you de-feeted it
[1:48:49] <%RealThiele> you can have many stands in PoE
[1:48:49] <Treasure_Vault> defetid pool
[1:48:53] <+aWanderingKaivo> you have DEFETID the monsters
[1:48:55] <%JoshManVGH> Well hey that's cool!
[1:48:56] <%Broand> Congrats pat! It's been DEFETID
[1:49:06] <%epide> so pat are ya liking this game?
[1:49:11] <blowfishchunky> Pat, do you think you're going to go back to school at some point?
[1:49:19] <blowfishchunky> idk why I care. it's just  you might be a good psychiatrist
[1:49:23] <$scallycap> time to read donations
[1:49:23] <@Moobot> Hey everybody, if you wanna check out Path of Exile's new Siege of the Atlas expansion go ahead and click this link! https://i.try.games/path-of-exile-3-17/xdp9ne
[1:49:28] <PunishedMercer_> pat...
[1:49:29] <%YakumoYomi> Sit bax and relax
[1:49:32] <Mogel56> Dude is OVERFLOWING with endurance charges
[1:49:52] <%Bloomingzonda> Pat is kirito
[1:49:53] <%RealThiele> much life regen
[1:50:03] <%JoshManVGH> Oh god he's Kirito-ing
[1:50:08] <+Rutheniel> All of the floating balls around him are charges, you can get them too!
[1:50:10] <Mogel56> Duelists can get a lot of leech life support
[1:50:10] <TrollKing96> Like that one scene from SAO.
[1:50:13] <%RealThiele> theres a build where you out regen setting yourself on fire to kill
[1:50:19] <+UltraViolet371> puts even demon's souls regen builds to shame
[1:50:20] <%Broand> You wanna see a cool Social feature this game has Pat? I can send you an ingame PM with item info!
[1:50:25] <+Rutheniel> oooo frost bomb is good synergy!
[1:50:28] <+aWanderingKaivo> ah yes righteous fire
[1:50:34] <%Bloomingzonda> Pat is a an SAO weeb confirmed
[1:51:15] <$scallycap> Man of Regeneration
[1:51:18] <Pookiedaexzile> Fuck Sword Art Online, this is a .Hack Sign House hold
[1:52:11] <%RealThiele> use flask
[1:52:24] <+Rutheniel> Logging out and back in teleports you to town btw, speedrunners use it to get places faster.
[1:52:58] <cpt_langosta> pool de-feet-ed
[1:53:04] <Zourath> Frostbomb is good in pretty much any build, since it reduces enemy regen.
[1:53:11] <+Rutheniel> YOU TOOK TOO LONG NOW YOUR CANDIES GONE
[1:53:11] <sourdough_scones> areas will re-instance if you leave them long enough
[1:53:15] <%Broand> Orb of gambling
[1:53:16] <%RealThiele> instance reset slowpoke
[1:53:20] <%asgard147> asgard147 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 29 months! 
[1:53:21] <+FoolsArcade> I like all the frogs hopping round in the middle of battle without a care
[1:53:21] <ergulor> you can just leave, you don't have to clean the map again
[1:53:24] <%epide> that can be amazing frost hammer is also one of my favs also you might want to look at totems
[1:53:53] <+AFellowDegen> Is Pat gonna check out Lost Ark?
[1:54:01] <+sasparillatango> use frost bomb!
[1:54:15] <ergulor> smellmo
[1:54:17] <%RealThiele> that regen is putting in work
[1:54:17] <+Rutheniel> Yeah, he's a speedrunner
[1:54:27] <$Mekhet09> Is this mostly single player?
[1:54:31] <chowndawg> haha
[1:54:39] <sonicblade38> @PatStaresAt usualy ppl hit end game day1, they very used to it
[1:54:41] <chowndawg> thank you thank you
[1:54:42] <%Broand> For reference: when you beat the acts you're around level 70
[1:54:45] <Zombrocom> After you have played through the campaign 100 times, you can really fly through it
[1:54:49] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt I love in this game that if you move away from the enemy as it attacks you it doesn't just auto hit you cause it started the animation to do so
[1:54:51] <idyota> theres currently a race, winner designs a unique
[1:55:01] <ergulor> you can play in groups
[1:55:08] <%Broand> They were on standard
[1:55:10] <chowndawg> you can, but most play by themself
[1:55:12] <ergulor> nope, paige started in standar
[1:55:14] <%RealThiele> you can also make guilds with shared stashes
[1:55:16] <%SovPho> Endgame is made significantly easier in groups but also pretty frequently significantly slower
[1:55:19] <+Rutheniel> You can group with up to five other players. There is a seperate challenge league if you deliberately want to play solo
[1:55:22] <%Joshbored> @Mekhet09 you can coop your friends but theres not really public mp
[1:55:35] <%Valison> @PatStaresAt Server doesn't really matter, its mostly just for the sake of ping, you can coop with people on any server
[1:55:42] <+aWanderingKaivo> and even do a build that focuses on stacking tons of auras that help out in groups a lot. at least you used to, haven't played in ages
[1:55:49] <$scallycap> why is your character portrait so sexy?
[1:56:11] <chowndawg> yea, league and hardcore
[1:56:30] <tanarath> Characters go into the main server after the league finishes
[1:56:31] <@Moobot> Hey everybody, if you wanna check out Path of Exile's new Siege of the Atlas expansion go ahead and click this link! https://i.try.games/path-of-exile-3-17/xdp9ne
[1:56:45] <+UltraViolet371> god it's like walking into a warframe relay
[1:56:52] <Pookiedaexzile> How much you wanna bet that unique will be dick themed
[1:56:56] <ergulor> Giant enemy crab
[1:56:57] <cpt_langosta> hitch hitch hitch, it's all will smith in this bitch
[1:57:04] <retrosadness> good ole crab dude
[1:57:11] <%Ashrox117> Bullet jump in slow mo
[1:57:13] <+Rutheniel> If you're having frame drops, switching to Vulkan in the options menu can help, but because it's an engine switch it freezes the game a bit as it reloads everything.
[1:57:18] <ludekitzu> Oh boy I hope I didn't arrive too late to see Pat have a panic attack at the sight of the Skill Yggdrasil Tree.
[1:57:19] <+aWanderingKaivo> just vomiting particle effects
[1:57:28] <CapCasual> @PatStaresAt The event that is taking place is only in the Hardcore Solo Self-Found version of Archnemesis.
[1:57:31] <%epide> wait even the chill nature is like a relay
[1:57:34] <+Rutheniel> Also quite a few uniques back in the day were made by people who paid serious money to support the game.
[1:57:42] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt Pat btw new war is pretty fun on warframe the only issue is ya gotta grind up a railjack before you can go into it
[1:57:48] <Zombrocom> War banner is a good pick up
[1:57:49] <+sasparillatango> playing in groups is actually optimal
[1:57:51] <chowndawg> the totem is a stand on a stick
[1:57:53] <BepBepAmShep> ancestral protector is pretty useful for the attack speed buff.
[1:57:55] <+Rutheniel> Yes
[1:57:55] <Mogel56> So many good choices lone 3 of those skills
[1:58:04] <cpt_langosta> stans? undertale?
[1:58:05] <+Rutheniel> The ancestral protector
[1:58:05] <Zombrocom> Ancestral protector
[1:58:09] <+aWanderingKaivo> decoy is a taunt
[1:58:10] <%TheHateFish> Ancestor Totem summons Stands
[1:58:11] <Ozmodyas> I vote for stand
[1:58:12] <ergulor> the first one
[1:58:14] <+aWanderingKaivo> a taunting totem
[1:58:16] <+Rutheniel> Decoy is useless lmao
[1:58:30] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt It always astounded me, cause it was never the guy that looked like lord fuckyouup of Mt. Killabitch that was the real threat, it was always the butt naked guy named pussyslayer3000 with a dagger that really ran the show
[1:58:32] <Zombrocom> He has another reward for you
[1:58:33] <%Broand> There's another reward there
[1:58:37] <+Rutheniel> he offered you second gem coice
[1:58:40] <ergulor> pat there was another reward
[1:59:06] <Zombrocom> He has another free gem for you
[1:59:06] <%Broand> Talk to him again
[1:59:11] <Zombrocom> You skipped it
[1:59:12] <@PrefectusCorgi> Second gem choice
[1:59:13] <+aWanderingKaivo> it should be in his dialogue options after
[1:59:14] <Make_me_mad> A book of regrets would be impossibly large.
[1:59:16] <%epide> 2nd free gem
[1:59:19] <Mogel56> there was another gem choice
[1:59:44] <DeathByPoke7> gotta go fast
[1:59:46] <cpt_langosta> instant backstab? nice
[1:59:50] <%DashXero> Dash, of course.
[1:59:50] <Zombrocom> Steelskin is a very short duration shield, dash is... well. A dash.
[1:59:51] <%epide> LOVE the thunder tp
[1:59:51] <+Rutheniel> speed or protection lol
[2:00:00] <ergulor> movement skills to dodge
[2:00:08] <Pookiedaexzile> Flashstep
[2:00:14] <retrosadness> you can buy dash from nessa
[2:00:20] <%CatastropheCorvid> It gets worse
[2:00:22] <%CatastropheCorvid> Lol
[2:00:27] <+Rutheniel> That apparition is a challenge league reward iirc
[2:00:40] <ergulor> not while the trade window is open
[2:00:43] <+UltraViolet371> I too want to look like a celestial god
[2:01:00] <+Rutheniel> PoE is not that cruel, no lol
[2:01:01] <tanarath> You sold 4

[2:02:30] <%TheHateFish> All of them
[2:02:31] <Pookiedaexzile> Orbs
[2:02:31] <+SenorCounter> All of them
[2:02:31] <iteruq> all
[2:02:32] <+Rutheniel> There is a stash on the left side of lioneyes that you can store stuff in
[2:02:32] <$ArcanumArcanum> yes
[2:02:33] <BepBepAmShep> all of them
[2:02:33] <%Broand> All of tjem
[2:02:34] <CapCasual> All of them.
[2:02:34] <%vivaldiva> all of them
[2:02:35] <tanarath> ALL ORBS
[2:02:35] <Pookiedaexzile> And you sold them
[2:02:36] <@PrefectusCorgi> All
[2:02:36] <%SovPho> All of them
[2:02:36] <Zombrocom> They are ALL money
[2:02:36] <+Rofiarf> all of them
[2:02:36] <%TheHateFish> Yes
[2:02:36] <%GinAndRoses> all of them
[2:02:36] <irziggo> gold labels
[2:02:37] <+SenorCounter> yup
[2:02:38] <AnnoyedApricot> yes
[2:02:39] <%CatastropheCorvid> yes
[2:02:40] <+bigslinglelino> Tragic
[2:02:42] <%SovPho> yes
[2:02:44] <chowndawg> all
[2:02:47] <%TheHateFish> You can, but it's not worth it
[2:02:47] <%SovPho> barter system
[2:02:48] <Pookiedaexzile> One guy
[2:02:48] <@Ranryu692> that's so fucking stupid, just use money
[2:02:50] <$scallycap> you fucking trip over scrolls, keep the orbs
[2:02:50] <+SenorCounter> You'll find enough of those
[2:02:51] <%GinAndRoses> you CAN doesn't mean you should
[2:02:52] <+Rofiarf> i mean you can, but they are worth less
[2:02:52] <+ShinobiAJ> the transmutes sell for wisdoms augments dont
[2:02:53] <CapCasual> Not all.
[2:02:53] <tanarath> YOU CAN BUT DON'T
[2:02:54] <Parapattern> I just tuned in and what the FUCK is happening on this screen?
[2:02:54] <dgull42> You can sell Alterations (Blue Orbs), they're relatively low value.
[2:02:54] <Zombrocom> You basically sold a nickel to get pennies
[2:02:54] <+AFellowDegen> just because you can doesn't mean you should
[2:02:54] <%CatastropheCorvid> You can sell some, but there's different sell values.
[2:02:55] <Esipode> Just the whetstones to sell
[2:02:56] <%Broand> You can! it's called currency exchange except the exchange rate is awful and one sided
[2:02:59] <chowndawg> sell some not all
[2:03:03] <%AncelDeLambert> @Ranryu692 right?
[2:03:04] <+SenorCounter> Put them in stash
[2:03:05] <%Man_in_the_Red> not all of the currency are good
[2:03:06] <%CatastropheCorvid> It's a whole thing, check out vendor recipes.
[2:03:06] <$scallycap> youll get more orbs
[2:03:18] <iteruq> chaos orbs are most popular  player to player trade currency
[2:03:23] <Ozmodyas> You can, it’s basically trading a nickel for a penny because you really need copper for some reason
[2:03:24] <Pookiedaexzile> You'll never get more orbs
[2:03:27] <+bigslinglelino> Everytime you visit the hub just throw orbs into the stash
[2:03:27] <+TheWhiteTrey> So did the new expansion for this only come out on PC?
[2:03:35] <+VariantX7> Omg that's like telling you to ctrl-alt-del
[2:03:35] <@Moobot> Hey everybody, if you wanna check out Path of Exile's new Siege of the Atlas expansion go ahead and click this link! https://i.try.games/path-of-exile-3-17/xdp9ne
[2:03:45] <+Rutheniel> There is a stash to store things btw Pat, its shared between characters.
[2:03:55] <chowndawg> @Ranryu692 by making money into useable items you don't get crazy inflation that comes with mmos
[2:04:12] <Ozmodyas> Yeah don’t worry about it, everyone makes minor mistakes like this their first time playing PoE and it doesn’t matter in the long run
[2:04:17] <+Rutheniel> Angery man
[2:04:20] <$PinkertonDanPie> Hey @patstaresat are the builds still "optimize everything to just spam one ability"
[2:04:24] <@Ranryu692> if you click on the link below the video, the page it takes you to has a countdown timer
[2:04:27] <cpt_langosta> my son, anger bloodman
[2:04:30] <+SenorCounter> Yup, get currency tab; then through excess currency into stash.
[2:04:32] <+Rutheniel> You can always get more stuff though, its no big deal
[2:04:44] <@Ranryu692> it comes to consoles in 4 days, 21 hours
[2:04:53] <dgull42> Pat like-a the BIG Totem
[2:04:59] <+Rutheniel> @PinkertonDanPie You can make builds that do one button, or many button, they've added in a lot more utility skills
[2:05:03] <cpt_langosta> hongry
[2:05:06] <%king_wragles> I can't believe Pat's going for a Polnareff build
[2:05:09] <Zombrocom> Pat will slowly fall into the ancestral warchief build
[2:05:13] <+SenorCounter> Might want to look up totems on the passive tree
[2:05:19] <%CatastropheCorvid> Hey Pat, is it Dual or DoubleStrike that you were using?
[2:05:19] <%RealThiele> searing totem is fun to do totem shenanigans
[2:05:20] <Ozmodyas> If you really like the stands you should consider playing a Marauder and going for the Chieftain subclass
[2:05:39] <ergulor> yeah i loved that build
[2:05:42] <idyota> champion totems is really good too
[2:05:43] <Mogel56> Marauder class gets more support for warchief
[2:05:45] <+Rutheniel> Totems are a dedicated part of the tree, its directly below where the duelist starts
[2:05:48] <%twoto858> was Pat always into PoE?
[2:05:48] <%GinAndRoses> totems are in fact dope as shit
[2:05:49] <+RoggleJr> RoggleJr subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 21 months! 
[2:05:51] <chowndawg> there are lots of dope shit in this game
[2:06:16] <Zombrocom> Marauder, cheiftain, spec into totems and look up ancestral bond
[2:06:25] <iteruq> he has those nodes closer on tree
[2:06:25] <%king_wragles> @PatStaresAt I think there's a character shared stash to dump all your orbs into when you're gonna delete
[2:06:27] <%RealThiele> dump your shit in your stash before u delete
[2:06:28] <%CatastropheCorvid> Lol, just like your tall as hell 14 character
[2:06:30] <+Rutheniel> Templar also gets a totem class, but its more focused on spellcasting
[2:06:34] <Zombrocom> Eventually you can have like 3 or 4 dudes slamming away
[2:06:38] <Daxalog> Was Diablo that bad?
[2:06:43] <%king_wragles> LUL
[2:06:44] <$scallycap> LUL
[2:06:45] <AnnoyedApricot> LuL
[2:06:46] <tanarath> Check some builds first & make a new character to save your orbs & items, your stash is shared
[2:06:48] <%GinAndRoses> HEEEYYOOOOOO
[2:06:50] <%CatastropheCorvid> @king_wragles The stash is shared across the league.
[2:06:51] <%shurtal> WOW
[2:06:53] <ergulor> ahhah+
[2:06:53] <%king_wragles> @Daxalog The opposite
[2:06:54] <$PinkertonDanPie> @rutheniel so that sounds like they added more variety while not alienating people who liked POEs original systems? That sounds pretty good.
[2:06:57] <%RealThiele> LUL
[2:06:59] <Pookiedaexzile> Pat be like " Oh this is just my stream character you bitches don't get the real one"
[2:07:05] <chowndawg> I don't think duelist is a bad choice for melee totems
[2:07:07] <%king_wragles> @king_wragles I'll pretend like I know what that means!
[2:07:11] <+Fetrigon> sheesh pat LUL
[2:07:14] <segychan> Unlimited power
[2:07:22] <Ozmodyas> Do you think you will be streaming your future character builds after this sponsored stream?  Would be fun to see
[2:07:22] <+aWanderingKaivo> it gets nuts at high levels
[2:07:23] <%Man_in_the_Red> just wait till you hit the Labyrinth
[2:07:26] <hakumaribo> wtf this games free?
[2:07:27] <+ShinobiAJ> yeah this game has a crazy exponential pwoer curve
[2:07:34] <chowndawg> it's funny becuase you are pretty zero dps lol
[2:07:34] <fragdar> yeah dude.. you are basicaly a god on earth
[2:07:37] <+Rutheniel> The endgame is ALL about stacking a ton of systems on top of one another to create big damage
[2:07:40] <DXLelouch24> Damn making your fiance your item mule
[2:07:45] <+Fetrigon> yeah but you got no drip pat
[2:07:57] <+Fetrigon> D R I P L E S S
[2:07:59] <%rumtumtugnutz> Don’t worry, that’ll change
[2:08:01] <badzombie28> Can you respec in this game?
[2:08:02] <scotti3000> hey @patstaresat how excited are you for Elden Ring?
[2:08:06] <Vuilionne> go get the drip pat
[2:08:09] <Ozmodyas> You can reposition the totem by summoning a new one btw
[2:08:12] <+aWanderingKaivo> not easily
[2:08:18] <+aWanderingKaivo> nope, one skill
[2:08:20] <segychan> this is the only game I've paid for drip in, they deserve the money
[2:08:21] <Zombrocom> 1 node per point
[2:08:21] <%Broand> nooooo
[2:08:21] <%SovPho> doesn't matter if you do dps on your first playthrough tbh
[2:08:23] <+sasparillatango> refund 1 point
[2:08:24] <+Rutheniel> No, it refunds one point each.
[2:08:26] <%SovPho> just enjoy it until you get walled
[2:08:26] <Vuilionne> Refund points equal 1 point refunded, so 1 skill
[2:08:26] <%Broand> no it wond
[2:08:29] <librettodude> I think there's also free full-tree resets with every league changeover
[2:08:31] <+SenorCounter> The refund points are also currency
[2:08:33] <%TheHateFish> One respec point respects one point
[2:08:33] <chowndawg> point per point
[2:08:34] <CapCasual> 1 Point = 1 Passive.
[2:08:37] <dgull42> NOPE, not all the points - one refund undoes one point
[2:08:40] <+ShinobiAJ> each refund point is or one passive point
[2:08:42] <+FoolsArcade> Pat of Exile?
[2:08:46] <%shurtal> Pat of Exile
[2:08:46] <badzombie28> Ooo nice
[2:08:47] <+sasparillatango> this game eats time yea
[2:08:49] <tanarath> No, refund points are 1 skill forest point per refund point
[2:08:51] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> !sellout
[2:08:52] <@Moobot> @AmanisHouseOfNonsense "If you *ever* have the opportunity to sell out you sell out as hard as you can it will be the best thing that ever happened to your fucking life! No one ever regretted selling out, except for 'artists' who care about their 'integrity' 'n shit." ~Pat 2016
[2:08:52] <+Rutheniel> PAT OF EXILE
[2:09:04] <fragdar> 3 weeks and my work productivity will completely die... iei
[2:09:06] <+Dappercat> played this game since beta like 8 years ago, it's great but not really for everyone
[2:09:11] <+Yapdor> Would you play the new D2 remaster @PatStaresAt  ?
[2:09:13] <$PinkertonDanPie> don't you love doing sponsor stuff for games that are actually good
[2:09:13] <Vuilionne> its fun, just dont gamble the boxes LUL
[2:09:17] <Zombrocom> Total war warhammer 3 will be where my time is spent before elden ring drops
[2:09:19] <@PrefectusCorgi> !pathofexlie
[2:09:20] <+WhiteClaudiaMk> nothing in life is free except for path of exile
[2:09:25] <+Rutheniel> it must mean it has HUGE GUTS
[2:09:25] <DXLelouch24> Its free, no downside
[2:09:28] <+ShinobiAJ> thats what she said
[2:09:30] <%CatastropheCorvid> Buy 0 get one free
[2:09:32] <$PinkertonDanPie> and warframe
[2:09:33] <@Ranryu692> Oozeboil, gross
[2:09:33] <Pookiedaexzile> That would be a huge Btch
[2:09:34] <chowndawg> free realestate
[2:09:40] <$PinkertonDanPie> Warframe pretty free too
[2:09:43] <idyota> fyi duelist is 100% viable as a totem character
[2:09:46] <@PrefectusCorgi> !pathofexile
[2:09:46] <@Moobot> @PrefectusCorgi Hey everybody, if you wanna check out Path of Exile's new Siege of the Atlas expansion go ahead and click this link! https://i.try.games/path-of-exile-3-17/xdp9ne
[2:09:55] <dgull42> The fact that respecing is difficult/costly is part of why going into a character with a general plan is so important.
[2:09:59] <Pookiedaexzile> Warframe steals your life force
[2:10:01] <Pookiedaexzile> that aint free
[2:10:10] <$PinkertonDanPie> lol
[2:10:16] <Pookiedaexzile> fucking cheeked up robot bitches
[2:10:17] <$Mekhet09> When are you out of the tutorial?
[2:10:29] <ashuckel> after 1000 hours
[2:10:31] <+aWanderingKaivo> its also why I never get back into PoE because I don't want to research builds for a whole day sadly
[2:10:36] <+Rutheniel> OH HERE WE GO
[2:10:37] <@Moobot> Hey everybody, if you wanna check out Path of Exile's new Siege of the Atlas expansion go ahead and click this link! https://i.try.games/path-of-exile-3-17/xdp9ne
[2:10:38] <ashuckel> and you still won't know 20% of it
[2:10:39] <KillMach1> I ❤ u Pat
[2:10:45] <%Broand> YO
[2:10:45] <$PinkertonDanPie> the new Warframe update had the dumbest cutscenes shenanigans
[2:10:46] <+Rutheniel> UNIQUE
[2:10:48] <%TheHateFish> Unique
[2:10:48] <+SenorCounter> Unique
[2:10:48] <+Rutheniel> TIME

[2:10:49] <%Broand> Unique
[2:10:50] <AnnoyedApricot> it's a unique
[2:10:51] <segychan> numbers go UP
[2:10:52] <Zombrocom> That is a unique
[2:10:53] <ergulor> that0's an unique
[2:10:54] <PunishedMercer_> das unique
[2:10:57] <dgull42> Unique/Legendary
[2:10:57] <$PinkertonDanPie> but it's spoilers so can't talk about it here
[2:10:59] <%GinAndRoses> unique
[2:11:01] <cpt_langosta> UNLIMITED PAUA
[2:11:02] <DXLelouch24> It doesnt take a whole day, just look stuff up and decide what you want to play.
[2:11:03] <chowndawg> unique
[2:11:03] <Ozmodyas> Unique!
[2:11:05] <Zombrocom> Ah, doedres damning. Not too useful for you
[2:11:06] <%Broand> Oooh doedres damning
[2:11:14] <+SenorCounter> You get curse gems later
[2:11:15] <%CatastropheCorvid> Give that to Paige if she's Curse Witch!
[2:11:15] <+Rutheniel> Curses are debuffs you dont have yet
[2:11:16] <%TheHateFish> Curses are debuffsa
[2:11:19] <Zombrocom> It's mostly useless for now
[2:11:21] <+aWanderingKaivo> curses are debuffs, usually only one on an enemy
[2:11:23] <Mogel56> Resistance on that ring is great for early game
[2:11:23] <idyota> curse is a debuff, default is one
[2:11:24] <dgull42> Keep it for another character
[2:11:25] <AntlerNoodle> It means you can apply an additional curse
[2:11:34] <chowndawg> not good for you, but a neat item
[2:11:36] <%Broand> Pop it in your stash you might find a use for it
[2:11:41] <Ozmodyas> Those are build defining, save them for later or you can sell them to other players
[2:11:42] <ashuckel> there are curses in the game, and you can only apply 1 per enemy, unless you have more curse limit like that
[2:11:48] <%Valison> curses are very strong but you only get them later, you can put it in your stash for later
[2:11:54] <agripina> "What color does that mean?" Pat- 2022
[2:11:56] <+bigslinglelino> Curse is an enemy debuff skill
[2:12:03] <%TheHateFish> If you do a totem dude, you can make a totem that applies curses in an AoE
[2:12:09] <segychan> currency tab totally worth @patstaresat
[2:12:29] <$PinkertonDanPie> I wonder if this will run well on the Steam Deck
[2:12:30] <Parapattern> Brood Princess is a good nickname for Paige
[2:12:34] <+bigslinglelino> Currency tab will open your third eye
[2:12:36] <+Rutheniel> ESSENCES
[2:12:40] <ergulor> essence
[2:12:45] <ergulor> a past leage mechanic

[2:13:16] <ergulor> just cliokc the enemy multiple times
[2:13:17] <iteruq> :)
[2:13:17] <chowndawg> click on it
[2:13:20] <tanarath> Another past league mechanic
[2:13:22] <chowndawg> multiple times
[2:13:29] <%GinAndRoses> surprise!
[2:13:32] <concerned_dm> this looks like something that can satisfy my monkey brain by spamming abilities and acquiring color coded loot
[2:13:36] <$vixenpunch> Normal to rare with a guaranteed mod is essences
[2:13:40] <%TheHateFish> Yes
[2:13:44] <%TheHateFish> They just sorta show up now
[2:13:45] <%GinAndRoses> sure is
[2:13:45] <+Rutheniel> Yep!
[2:13:46] <%Broand> Oh this is an old league mechanic yeah
[2:13:47] <AnnoyedApricot> yeah they just add previous league mechanics into the game
[2:13:48] <+rafaelba93> they pile up
[2:13:48] <ergulor> yes
[2:13:48] <tanarath> Yes! They stay!
[2:13:49] <+aWanderingKaivo> some of em at least
[2:13:50] <%Ascethetic> YEP
[2:13:50] <%TheHateFish> Yes
[2:13:50] <PunishedMercer_> old league mechanics get stacked in
[2:13:51] <+ShinobiAJ> yes
[2:13:52] <%CatastropheCorvid> Yeah, all the old mechanics are still present
[2:13:52] <+sasparillatango> the game has all leagues
[2:13:52] <+SenorCounter> They're stacked
[2:13:52] <dgull42> Some of them go evergreen
[2:13:53] <Zombrocom> They just get added to the game
[2:13:54] <Mogel56> Old league mechanics become standard
[2:13:55] <DeathByPoke7> all of em
[2:13:55] <Zombrocom> Permenantly
[2:13:55] <ergulor> yup
[2:13:56] <%Broand> At a vastly reduced rate but ye
[2:13:56] <%AnIcedCoffee> Old mechanics get meshed into the core game
[2:13:57] <%CatastropheCorvid> Yep
[2:13:58] <tanarath> Why would you delete it?
[2:13:59] <AnnoyedApricot> scourge didn't get added
[2:13:59] <chowndawg> yea like 5 years ago
[2:14:00] <%SovPho> They become evergreen usually
[2:14:00] <segychan> this game is additive
[2:14:00] <ergulor> some go core
[2:14:02] <+sasparillatango> ehhh not all actually, most
[2:14:02] <$vixenpunch> Yep
[2:14:02] <%Man_in_the_Red> after act 5 it could
[2:14:03] <BepBepAmShep> not all of them, but most are rolled into the base game
[2:14:03] <+ShinobiAJ> no scourge didnt get added back
[2:14:04] <%SovPho> It can yeah
[2:14:04] <ashuckel> scourge didn't get added
[2:14:04] <+Rutheniel> Yes, most of the time, if the playerbase doesnt enjoy it, they dont integrate it
[2:14:05] <%Broand> no scourge didn't make it
[2:14:05] <dgull42> Some are evergreen, some are ditched
[2:14:06] <Esipode> No Scourge didn't get merged but like 30 other mechanics are in
[2:14:07] <$ArcanumArcanum> a lot of mechanics get rolled into core. Scourge didn't get added
[2:14:08] <Ozmodyas> Yes they get added to the base game with reduced spawn rate
[2:14:09] <chowndawg> they get rolled in
[2:14:09] <idyota> specifically not scourge
[2:14:11] <+Rutheniel> So scourge isnt in because it was pretty meh
[2:14:12] <Zombrocom> Scourge didn't get added no
[2:14:13] <$vixenpunch> Nearly every one
[2:14:13] <xiccy> Dog Pile of mechanics
[2:14:14] <chowndawg> not all mechanics
[2:14:17] <+sasparillatango> YOU HAVE NO IDEA
[2:14:19] <chowndawg> just the ones they like
[2:14:19] <$vixenpunch> Scourge didn’t go core
[2:14:21] <+polothegreatest> Free game? woolieF
[2:14:21] <$ArcanumArcanum> They throw away a lot
[2:14:23] <ashuckel> most past leagues get reiterated as part of the base game, Scourge in specific didn't make it, yet
[2:14:24] <Esipode> They have started sunsetting mechanics
[2:14:24] <+SenorCounter> Oh yeah you're gonna have to dig DEEP!
[2:14:26] <ergulor> you have no idea
[2:14:27] <$ArcanumArcanum> but there's a lot that isn't tossed
[2:14:27] <%TheHateFish> Not all of them. But most of them.
[2:14:27] <+Rutheniel> PoE uses the ENTIRE BUFFALO
[2:14:30] <+Rutheniel> REPEATEDLY
[2:14:37] <$PinkertonDanPie> yes all of them pat except for the one example you thought of
[2:14:38] <chowndawg> it's great
[2:14:39] <$vixenpunch> There’s about 15 league mechanics in from old seasons
[2:14:49] <$vixenpunch> In the new endgame it’s all about focusing the ones you like
[2:14:50] <badguy8312> woolieS woolieT
[2:14:52] <badguy8312> woolieU woolieF
[2:14:53] <%TheHateFish> Spike-thing
[2:14:54] <+sasparillatango> I cannot emphasize enough how overwhelming the end game is
[2:14:57] <badguy8312> FUCK
[2:15:04] <+VariantX7> How many mechanics and endgames does this game have?
[2:15:05] <%Broand> You'll find a bunch of those, so use it on an item with a nice slots when you'd like
[2:15:07] <tanarath> rip
[2:15:07] <ashuckel> perfect
[2:15:10] <%CatastropheCorvid> They get muuuuch better than that
[2:15:13] <cpt_langosta> @badguy8312 LUL
[2:15:14] <+sasparillatango> don't hang on to it, it just gets weaker
[2:15:15] <AnnoyedApricot> that's kinda why stashes are so important
[2:15:18] <ergulor> don't bother that's a baby one, better ones will drop later
[2:15:20] <chowndawg> use them
[2:15:22] <+aWanderingKaivo> I never really got into endgame stuff with path of exile, every time I've went back to it I just do the main acts once or twice to see some new stuff. guess I'm weird
[2:15:28] <chowndawg> they are common and get much better
[2:15:30] <+sasparillatango> gets weaker relatively
[2:15:31] <%Broand> it means it won't level with you
[2:15:33] <segychan> it's not useful at higher level
[2:15:34] <+SenorCounter> That is the lowest version of that essence
[2:15:36] <%CatastropheCorvid> Only good up to a certain level
[2:15:40] <Karhax> it has a max level
[2:15:41] <segychan> but you can combine them to make higher tears
[2:15:41] <+timsellart> you can upgrade essences
[2:15:42] <ergulor> no
[2:15:45] <+A0N33> You get stronger versions of it later too so there's no point in saving it.
[2:15:47] <+Rutheniel> Essences have tiers, the one you picked up is the lowest tier.
[2:15:47] <BepBepAmShep> Three of the same essence can be combined into one of a better tier. Kind of like gems in Diablo.
[2:15:57] <%CatastropheCorvid> You can also combine them to get better ones
[2:16:00] <tanarath> Just save them
[2:16:01] <DeathByPoke7> you can grab something from. town
[2:16:08] <Ozmodyas> It’s only good for level 35 and below, like it says
[2:16:09] <+timsellart> you should try and get rid of white items ASAP
[2:16:10] <tanarath> You can upgrade them
[2:16:13] <Mogel56> just becomes less useful, those items can fuse fi you get more of them but it's very unlikely to get enough.
[2:16:20] <+aWanderingKaivo> you have a gem to level up there
[2:16:27] <%Broand> now that, THAT is this games version of crafting
[2:16:28] <+aWanderingKaivo> right as I typed it lol
[2:16:41] <%TheHateFish> Portal scroll on the ground, dude
[2:16:57] <segychan> you can build yourself a stand by making a guardian out of armor pieces
[2:17:02] <$vixenpunch> Yo pat I got an extra copy of an item called a tabula rasa, it’s a chest piece with 6 linked white sockets and no stats, it lets you try gems real easy if you want it just say the word
[2:17:16] <%Broand> Income unioque
[2:17:19] <$scallycap> what an ass beating
[2:17:21] <+aWanderingKaivo> nice
[2:17:24] <%CatastropheCorvid> AGAIN?
[2:17:26] <+Rutheniel> ooooooo tear of purity!!
[2:17:27] <DeathByPoke7> #ad
[2:17:29] <%CatastropheCorvid> Nice
[2:17:29] <+SenorCounter> amulet
[2:17:30] <+Rutheniel> that one is good!
[2:17:31] <+SenorCounter> nice
[2:17:32] <%Broand> Oh tear of purity
[2:17:33] <%CatastropheCorvid> Level 20 tho
[2:17:35] <%Man_in_the_Red> did he use a berserker?
[2:17:36] <%DashXero> Man... Pat's getting some damn good drops.
[2:17:37] <Ozmodyas> Nice!

[2:17:50] <$vixenpunch> Tear of purity pog
[2:17:52] <dgull42> It's because he put a Berserker into the first statue
[2:17:59] <%Broand> Hold alt to get more info I think

[2:18:02] <$scallycap> shared box
[2:18:10] <+Rutheniel> So, one of the archnemesis mods you put in rewards uniques
[2:18:14] <GhostlySkunk> Hello friends~!
[2:18:16] <Zombrocom> Purity of elements is a elemental resist aura
[2:18:20] <%Bluwizard21> Looks like a Ring of FaP to me
[2:18:21] <%Broand> Purity of elements gives you a resistance buff but reserves mana
[2:18:22] <+timsellart> there is a portal skill gem you can get
[2:18:27] <$vixenpunch> Purity of elements makes 50% of your mana unusable but makes you immune to all elemental ailments and gives you 30% of each resistance
[2:18:28] <+Rutheniel> There is a portal gem you can acquire later that you can put on your hot bar
[2:18:30] <Mogel56> There's a town portal skill gem that's very rare
[2:18:41] <$vixenpunch> So no more being frozen
[2:18:43] <Ozmodyas> Purity of Elements is an Aura with element resist
[2:18:44] <%TheHateFish> You can also make it cast on death
[2:18:48] <ergulor> it eats one of your gem slots tho
[2:18:50] <AnnoyedApricot> FREE.99
[2:18:50] <%GinAndRoses> free!
[2:18:54] <%CatastropheCorvid> Glad you're having fun, Pat! Maybe I'll see you in game!
[2:19:02] <GhostlySkunk> I just can't get into Path of Exile.

[2:19:51] <+Rutheniel> yeah!
[2:19:51] <Mogel56> yes
[2:19:56] <$ArcanumArcanum> yes but gems have level requirements that go up as you level them up
[2:20:02] <$vixenpunch> Right click the top of one of the tabs to look at affinity
[2:20:15] <%Broand> AHHAHAHA no its not
[2:20:16] <tanarath> Yeah!
[2:20:20] <dgull42> Sorting tool
[2:20:20] <ergulor> not at all
[2:20:23] <%Man_in_the_Red> thats the auto sort
[2:20:25] <Esipode> Affinity auto sorts your stash
[2:20:25] <Zombrocom> Affinity is basically auto sorting
[2:20:25] <+SenorCounter> When you ctrl click they will go into their tab
[2:20:27] <+sasparillatango> no too much don't think about it
[2:20:27] <$ArcanumArcanum> Affinity means when you ctrl+click a thing it automatically goes to that tab
[2:20:31] <Zombrocom> Things auto go to that tab w
[2:20:31] <dgull42> Basically you can say "Orbs go in Tab 2"
[2:20:33] <$vixenpunch> It’ll make it so that whenever you control click an item it gets vacuumed into the garage by
[2:20:33] <+Rutheniel> Affinity is autosort when you put the items into the stash
[2:20:35] <+SenorCounter> Not sorting
[2:20:36] <+sasparillatango> it auto plcaes those types of items inot that tab
[2:20:38] <$vixenpunch> Into the tab*
[2:20:38] <+ShinobiAJ> it means you automatically put the associated item into that tab on control click
[2:20:43] <Zombrocom> When you ctrl click em
[2:20:43] <+SenorCounter> Ctrl click from inventory
[2:20:44] <$vixenpunch> Auto sorting
[2:20:48] <+SenorCounter> They go into their afinity tab
[2:20:55] <$vixenpunch> So if you control click something from your inventory

[2:21:08] <$vixenpunch> Specifys
[2:21:12] <cpt_langosta> so, you strip naked in order to organize your inventory, too, huh?
[2:21:14] <ergulor> just use gem
[2:21:17] <tanarath> You can make only flasks, only weapons, only skill gems, then have it sort based on colour, offense, defense, passive, etc in the tab.
[2:21:18] <CapCasual> @PatStaresAt It means that without having that tab selected, the type of item you chose will go from your inventory to there automatically.
[2:21:32] <$vixenpunch> Go to your first tab
[2:21:39] <AnnoyedApricot> yes
[2:21:39] <dgull42> Yep
[2:21:39] <+Rutheniel> Yes

[2:21:47] <Karhax> stash is league based
[2:21:47] <ergulor> yes
[2:21:53] <tanarath> Make another character first, but yes
[2:21:54] <%Man_in_the_Red> you need 1 character in the league to keep the stash
[2:21:55] <$vixenpunch> It’s real convenient
[2:21:59] <$vixenpunch> Yes
[2:22:03] <chowndawg> yes, league specific
[2:22:07] <ergulor> yup
[2:22:11] <tanarath> YES
