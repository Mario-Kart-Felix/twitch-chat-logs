[0:41:18] <GarbageQueenEllie> No way, that kid's trying to buy hookers
[0:41:19] <skyentombment> Yeah.... it's the car owner running the scam, not Takashi
[0:41:19] <%Razputin217> Throw your hands in the air if youse a true pauper
[0:41:19] <melonsouda> Sidestory time?
[0:41:22] <%shiplord13> The kid is scamming him
[0:41:22] <%sumrand0> LYING KID

[0:41:22] <+ClicheHiei> Are we all scammer EACH OTHER?!
[0:41:23] <%Blackleafx> @PatStaresAt adachi is playing his own substory atm
[0:41:23] <%penitentpendant> Next letter: "Nevermind. Some guy in a white business suit destroyed the guy hounding me."
[0:41:26] <SomersaultJustice> like that lock guy in jojo
[0:41:26] <%honeyman18> this kid is gonna be a shit somehow
[0:41:29] <promessav2> law students are stupid

[0:41:34] <%Stepherzzzzzz> Grifting for a cult
[0:41:34] <star_feline> Or the kid is taking advantage of you
[0:41:37] <%juxtest> Time to go beat up every guy hanging out in a narrow alley with his car
[0:41:38] <yourliteraldog> Yeah Violence
[0:41:39] <nmaten> isnt that always the solution
[0:41:39] <%Pacifcgrim> USE GUN
[0:41:40] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> I'll kill you old man!
[0:41:41] <stevenlambchops> VIOLENCE IS ALWAYS THE ANSWER

[0:41:45] <SaltyAzteca> AND TAKE HIS WALLET

[0:42:01] <%seraphimjordan> LIKE A COP
[0:42:01] <CelestialCage> Does Ichiban "not kill" people too?
[0:42:03] <%jjolion> Remember kids, violence is the answer
[0:42:06] <+lordericter> I mean a 10k bumper is way too stupid expensive
[0:42:07] <%AzureGale> Just punch like 10000 dudes to make the money
[0:42:08] <%BoxNavy> "my wife was a scammer and i do scams in her honor but she is dead now"
[0:42:09] <%dearghostss> it's never too early to celebrate
[0:42:09] <jorniev> VIOLENCE IS THE QUESTION. THE AWNSER IS YES!
[0:42:11] <%DianaTheAscian> this is gonna end poorly
[0:42:11] <Gorgs7> @PatStaresAt silly pat, violence solves all problems
[0:42:12] <+Pyroclase> yeah but nobody ever actually drives those supercars
[0:42:15] <skyentombment> hey, how did Nanba solve the whisky thing?
[0:42:17] <+FatherGreyBeard> it's not a scam is it
[0:42:20] <%arancet> whats this predicted icon shit?
[0:42:22] <%juxtest> Turns out the guy is Takashi's dad who faked his death and escaped from prison
[0:42:24] <cardamomo88> WHAT IT IS REAL
[0:42:30] <ShichiNoBushi> Violence is the solution to all problems. If it's not working, you aren't using enough violence.
[0:42:36] <%BoxNavy> adachis voice is great
[0:42:37] <CelestialCage> ruh roh
[0:42:39] <+lordericter> So wait is pat gonna shit himself
[0:42:39] <MasterTonberry23> contrary to what they tell you violence solves a lot of problems. you just gotta be ready for the ugly consequences
[0:42:45] <silver__viii> I can't tell if Kasuga is a genius or dumb as shit
[0:42:45] <frozenottsel> It's Kiryu's car
[0:42:45] <SaltyAzteca> This dub isnt cringy, I actually like it!
[0:42:46] <%sumrand0> If anyone claims violence can't solve a problem: beat them senseless, PROBLEM SOLVED
[0:42:47] <+MordoPrime> RANKU UP
[0:42:48] <%DianaTheAscian> whats minimum wage like in Japan anyway?
[0:42:49] <%Deft_Thought> I like how Ichiban is considerably more reasonable as a person in these interactions than he is in the regular story
[0:42:50] <xcalibar2> adachis voice is so good
[0:42:50] <%bread_assassin> I think it's a scam in the other direction.

[1:00:24] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Even the writers couldn't figure out where to go.
[1:00:24] <%TheMattman1313> "Hey I'm just here"
[1:00:25] <+illusiveSaint> she said a gardening program like it was extra curricular aside from studying
[1:00:25] <+Feralspirit41> and then ichiban watched from the bushes

[1:26:01] <thelonechris> For when you need a quick fap
[1:26:02] <%Sternieliscious> Tissue has advertising on it.
[1:26:04] <%FacetiousAF> they REALLY need to bust
[1:26:05] <Joeggernaut777> It's a job isn't it?
[1:26:05] <melonsouda> It's just an Adertising thing isn't it ?
[1:26:05] <CelestialCage> Japan thing
[1:26:05] <%Stratiotai2> Stratiotai2 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 18 months! Hello this day from a vile prarie follower. So recently, my work place of about 50 people has had 4 positive covid cases in 7 days, and have done literally nothing about it aside from "keep your mask on, social distance, and wash your hands".
[1:26:05] <randomahole> advertising
[1:26:05] <%derekwst3> why not have tissues
[1:26:05] <+natjen8> In japan, its advertisement
[1:26:06] <silver__viii> japan LOVES tissues
[1:26:06] <@SoFarFetched> ADS
[1:26:07] <%T_Sasquatch> Advertising
[1:26:07] <reonome> its just ads
[1:26:08] <dinnydanny777> In the UK they ask homeless people to sell magazines to make money idk if its similar
[1:26:09] <star_feline> It's promotional material as far as I know
[1:26:10] <+StrifeZubia> @ghostfaceninja_ It uses the characters for like sunshine and sparrows or whatever, japan's weird
[1:26:10] <Final_Cosplay_Corps> pan handling
[1:26:11] <UlriktheSlayer1> it just seems like a japan thing
[1:26:11] <GoogleyGareth> They're ads on the tissues
[1:26:11] <%shurtal> advertising
[1:26:11] <%Jekado> Its an Ad thing
[1:26:11] <cardamomo88> IS LIKE AT AD THING??
[1:26:12] <%Rofiarf> a form of advertisement
[1:26:13] <Maleicus> advertising
[1:26:15] <@SSaryn> Dont Tissues usually havr ads on them?
[1:26:15] <%eyezehuhh> advertisements
[1:26:15] <%Smeagleman6> @PatStaresAt Advertising
[1:26:17] <@SoFarFetched> It's literally ADS Pat.
[1:26:18] <Zebroneath> there are advertisements on the tissues
[1:26:19] <%Jekado> its a form of Advertising
[1:26:20] <%bevyrage> the health ministry in japan funds both tissue dispersal and it's also used as a means to advertise locales
[1:26:21] <Arek_1> LUL
[1:26:23] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Qwik Fap?
[1:26:23] <MasterTonberry23> I could use tissues some times, my nose is always running
[1:26:23] <%charp35> isnt it just a form of advertisement
[1:26:24] <sonofthedeepsouth> T9 WANK
[1:26:28] <%linSP> the tissues have aids
[1:26:30] <sonofthedeepsouth> A quick Wank
[1:26:31] <%derekwst3> tissues are for your nose
[1:26:32] <skyentombment> Oh so it's like handing out flyers?
[1:26:32] <%eyezehuhh> Which honestly isn't a bad idea
[1:26:33] <SaltyAzteca> You can catch ADS from those tisues
[1:26:33] <UlriktheSlayer1> ad tissues?
[1:26:34] <%butterick> they have ads, and toilet paper is scarce
[1:26:34] <%Smeagleman6> Directly handing out flyers to people is illegal in Japan
[1:26:37] <dinnydanny777> The UK has a magazine called Big Issue that employs homeless people to sell copies, I don't know if it's similar
[1:26:37] <bigboy_baku> Business cards
[1:26:38] <%machshop> they're sign spinners
[1:26:38] <Thalchampz> so it's like panphleting
[1:26:38] <+AlphaRayAllen> Good luck silently blowing your nose fuckers
[1:26:39] <silver__viii> So sign spinning?
[1:26:40] <GoogleyGareth> It's cheap and useful
[1:26:40] <+natjen8> basically like those guys with the giant signs
[1:26:41] <GarbageQueenEllie> Ads are AAAAAIIIIIIDSSSS
[1:26:44] <+natjen8> who spin the signs around
[1:26:46] <%the22cstomp> they have advertisements on them
[1:26:47] <%Jekado> your gonna need to hold onto 20 fucking tissues for story content later
[1:26:49] <Hideow> They are like flyers,people give them to get your attention to something
[1:26:54] <sonofthedeepsouth> They have Aids
[1:26:54] <Louie_Salmon> And it also has some practical use so people have a reason to take it

[1:27:07] <%BoxNavy> when do you get an airship
[1:27:07] <Joeggernaut777> in Japan, tissue-marketing is a proven and inexpensive way to advertise. For a cost of as little as ¥10 to ¥25 you can get your message directly into the hands of potential customers. What's more, consumers who accept the tissues are likely to actually read your advertisement. -Stolen from Google
[1:27:09] <MasterTonberry23> Dudes just tryin to make it in this tough world

[2:00:59] <+DeltascapeV4> Yeah it will
[2:01:03] <CelestialCage> brutal
[2:01:04] <fIashman92> It spoils who lives and dies
[2:01:04] <%BoxNavy> kinda
[2:01:05] <Sunstalker> Look at the lady just breaking tables with her hips PogChamp
[2:01:06] <meromaromiro> Yes it will

[2:01:11] <%BoxNavy> nothing major it seems
[2:01:14] <%Monkeyweed21> it will spoil that Daigo sucks at his job
[2:01:16] <CelestialCage> a little but you'll be getting Ichiban's perspective at least
[2:01:16] <%GalacticaPhanto> mostly stuff from 5 and 6 but not too involved
[2:01:17] <%butthurtdave> A bit but out of context so it won't matter much
[2:01:18] <huskarl_zap> BLOOD ? PogChamp
[2:01:22] <Dr00_PhD> Kind of? You probably won't know what's being spoiled
[2:01:23] <colzack_> Spoils some stuff but you can still fully enjoy and understand the plot
[2:01:24] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Yakuza doesn't have any important spoilers

[2:01:40] <%dearghostss> i'm NOT A LOSER
[2:01:42] <%shunakiyama> As someone who's beat this game it does spoil some stuff from previous yakuza games
[2:01:42] <CelestialCage> You'll get Ichiban's perspective since he doesnt got a full understanding of the whole thing either
[2:01:44] <passione13> It will spoil characters
[2:01:45] <%LuckyLagomorph> @kingmemelord97 it's more about collecting in someone else's turf
[2:01:45] <huskarl_zap> Yakuza doesnt have spoilers only rubebr bullets
[2:01:48] <missingangle> It's probably more like you won't know what's spoiled till you play the other ones?
[2:01:48] <BooitsDock> SHE CHANGED ON THE SPOT
[2:01:49] <+Delenay> she magically changed clothes
[2:01:49] <Saltmeisterr> FUKYU

[2:18:57] <%butthurtdave> Also dont worry about all the Jobs you see, it's pretty easy to figure out what Jobs are the best for each character
[2:19:00] <NeroInfinite> hammer head
[2:19:00] <+doomunderthestairs> yep
[2:19:01] <%chiazam> Oh thank God
[2:19:03] <%JaydenSai> @chiazam It is!
[2:19:03] <PatchySouls> you had to invest challenge points for infinite stamina LUL
[2:19:06] <+doomunderthestairs> it was in Judgement too
[2:19:08] <KingVantq> @chiazam yeah
[2:19:09] <+Xfire_exe> I'm so excited for this next part!
[2:19:19] <%BusterRepukken> Imagine seeing Nanba run down the street at you with a broom
[2:19:24] <Blank9> it's "CHOSEN ONE" "I'M COMING" every time it's nanba's turn
[2:19:31] <+Link232> Yeah you basically want to max out Ichiban's agility with gear/boosters just so you don't have to wait for your party to run after to
[2:19:34] <+zetaplus> ichibans best class is hero anyway imo
[2:19:39] <ovan20> @PatStaresAt how Ichiban doesn't kill anyone with a baseball bat? D:
[2:19:40] <%chiazam> @BusterRepukken I'd fuckin shit
[2:19:42] <%BoxNavy> hi work :)

[2:20:03] <+SilverDevilfish> Speed
[2:20:03] <huskarl_zap> probably turn order
[2:20:04] <+Link232> I'm *pretty* sure agility is initiative alongside a random roll
[2:20:04] <Blank9> agility is turn order + evade
[2:20:05] <meromaromiro> Turn order and dodge
[2:20:05] <%Nekros4442> Isnt Agility just turn order and evasion?
[2:20:06] <ovan20> i think it's initiative
[2:20:06] <+AbnormalVoid> speed
[2:20:06] <melonsouda> What jobs will pat pick I wonder?
[2:20:08] <VritraReiRei> Yo look at that REAL poster in the back there!
[2:20:09] <%butthurtdave> Dexterity is crit chance
[2:20:09] <@SSaryn> Agility is just turn order and evade.
[2:20:10] <+zetaplus> i said in my opinion
[2:20:10] <huskarl_zap> SHITTERS NO HELP
[2:20:10] <%sighphers> SPD
[2:20:10] <CrankyVT> I thought it was just turn order
[2:20:11] <nmaten> initiative
[2:20:11] <jcflyguy> Agi affects turn order
[2:20:11] <Maleicus> evasion
[2:20:12] <%BoxNavy> elpers moon2B
[2:20:13] <+AbnormalVoid> accuracy
[2:20:13] <Blank9> but class has an invisible boost to turn order
[2:20:14] <+Solutha> sppeeeeed
[2:20:16] <ovan20> asccuracy
[2:20:16] <Joeggernaut777> Im guessing it increases the rate at which your party takes turns
[2:20:16] <%Nekros4442> Dex should just be crit chance
[2:20:17] <Blank9> dex is hit/crit
[2:20:17] <@SSaryn> Dex is crit and accuracy
[2:20:18] <Maleicus> hit chance
[2:20:19] <%Jekado> does it? My aglity is way up and he still acts later
[2:20:19] <colzack_> Accuracy and crit chance I think
[2:20:19] <televisedrevolting> Crits
[2:20:20] <%cobalt_phoenix_> oh so it improves initiative?
[2:20:21] <jcflyguy> Crit
[2:20:21] <fuji_92> hit chance

[2:25:39] <@SSaryn> @patstaresat Work towards the jobs Character skills as they are what you want for your party at the start
[2:25:39] <+omenoffate> The stat boosts matter
[2:25:41] <jcflyguy> Unlocked stats carry over tho
[2:25:41] <%Nekros4442> Pat, change Ichiban to the Foreman job at least once. You can change out of it afterwards. Game never tells you to do it and it unlocks a thing.
[2:25:43] <%Jekado> yeah red ball skills are permantly learned
[2:25:43] <Saltmeisterr> FOREMAN
[2:25:44] <hassanico2> @PatStaresAt If you just want to unlock something quick, give Ichiban Foreman and head next to your house
[2:25:44] <+Link232> Two important things: make sure you at least get the foreman job for Ichiban for the passive, and two make sure Ichiban gets the hero armor for the hero job
[2:25:44] <%BusterRepukken> Breaker is best
[2:25:44] <Blank9> if you become foreman, you get an exploration skill that's available in all classes
[2:25:46] <%Rofiarf> make sure to get forement for ichiban atleast to lvl 1
[2:25:46] <Joeggernaut777> Breaker?! Like Majima's Breaker?!

[2:27:48] <%BoxNavy> WutFace

[2:27:48] <%yeknomlive> rank ups are pretty fast
[2:27:48] <%NovaKnightmare> consider it hard mode
[2:27:49] <akitanito> That's your fault for grinding so hard
[2:27:49] <Saltmeisterr> NUMBER GO DOWN
[2:27:49] <Admiral_PopnFresh> go way down
[2:27:49] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt You only want to switch to Foreman once for an explore ability

[2:27:50] <%charp35> just for one and then change
[2:27:50] <+justianxix> goblin time
[2:27:50] <%Rofiarf> yeah job level has its own stats
[2:27:50] <%AzureGale> Don't worry about them
[2:27:50] <huskarl_zap> also your class will level quickly
[2:27:51] <+AlphaRayAllen> IT STARTS AT LEVEL 1
[2:27:52] <SoySocks> you'll have to grind
[2:27:52] <redrins> they'll go up soon enough
[2:27:52] <CrankyVT> Rank ups increase stats, so it'll catch up quick
[2:27:52] <%Not_Dutch_> strength go down
[2:27:53] <MasterTonberry23> nah itll be fine
[2:27:53] <london_flexing> Level 1 That
[2:27:53] <convo445> just comes with leveling your job
[2:27:53] <%snugglepuggs> @patstaresat equip Foreman then switch off of it after a certain pop up tutorial to unlock a move to unlock secret areas
[2:27:53] <%Jekado> you can forman and switch off you just need forman for a traversal tool
[2:27:54] <NeroInfinite> that's without gear pat
[2:27:54] <ovan20> @PatStaresAt IT'S BECAUSE THE CLASS IS LVL1
[2:27:54] <@SoFarFetched> no they just want you to select it
[2:27:54] <UlriktheSlayer1> forman seems like DPS ONLY
[2:27:55] <%Monkeyweed21> BOO HOO NUMBER GO DOWN WAAAA
[2:27:55] <Zarkith> That's just because you have no other job ranks yet
[2:27:55] <megaman_sentinel> without gear
[2:27:56] <%WhereIsWill> oh they get BLOWN UP
[2:27:56] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> you level up really fast
[2:27:56] <+AbnormalVoid> @PatStaresAt temporary, you gain stats for each job
[2:27:57] <fuji_92> FOREMAN IS LVL 1 DUDE
[2:27:57] <%shiplord13> They really go down
[2:27:57] <+TrevSmith222> Use it and change it right back.
[2:27:57] <%king_wragles> Stats low because job level will be low
[2:27:58] <%JaydenSai> Yeah who cares
[2:27:58] <%pectusumbra> yeah, your stats will dive until you catch back up. That's not uncommon
[2:27:58] <+Fusrahdo> Just level on trash mobs
[2:27:59] <%shunakiyama> Go foreman and go back to hero straight away after. Hero is ichis best class @PatStaresAt
[2:27:59] <jcflyguy> That's cuz they're Jlvl 1
[2:27:59] <mattynezz> Just for half a second, it unlocks an exploration skill just by switching to it on Ichi
[2:28:00] <+illusiveSaint> isn't this just for the job?
[2:28:00] <%Garthunox> thats cos you're going from a lvl 9 job to a lvl 1
[2:28:00] <star_feline> Just stick to hero man
[2:28:01] <a_mad_dragon> THEY GO UP FAST
[2:28:02] <+FlyingRamen> job levels come back quick enough
[2:28:02] <%Too_Much_Nukie> It's because this job is at level 1.
[2:28:03] <convo445> job levels go fast
[2:28:03] <Djinnazz> @PatStaresAt why are the negative stats in blue?
[2:28:04] <%coreyyotto> It's because you're comparing them to your lv. 10 stats in another job.
[2:28:04] <%sighphers> the consequences of grinding, unfortunately
[2:28:05] <DashXero> Check everyone else
[2:28:06] <%butthurtdave> Red Skills carry over to all classes but each class only has 2
[2:28:06] <sonofthedeepsouth> DO EET
[2:28:06] <TheNewJapanGuy> Gring bitch
[2:28:07] <hassanico2> @PatStaresAt Your starts will drop like this if you switch any job, but you'll gain permanent ones via job ranks instead

[2:29:20] <+AbnormalVoid> I think you have to leave the menu first @PatStaresAt
[2:29:21] <$StrawberryPantsu> Body Guard or Hero
[2:29:21] <%WhereIsWill> dark knight yeyeye
[2:29:21] <%BusterRepukken> Breakeer
[2:29:21] <CrankyVT> @PatStaresAt Bodyguard for Berserker Spirit, it carries across classes
[2:29:21] <jcflyguy> Breaker
[2:29:22] <skyentombment> Those first 3 outfits are perfect for paying 100 bucks to people to fuck off
[2:29:22] <silver__viii> BODYGUARD, big Dark Knight energy
[2:29:22] <fuji_92> I'd stay hero
[2:29:22] <%dantegus> hero
[2:29:22] <+DeltascapeV4> Musician

[2:29:22] <uncle_speeps> bodyguard is alright

[2:29:24] <fIashman92> Musician gains an all class heal at level 6
[2:29:25] <@SSaryn> Honestly Hero or Breaker is good for now
[2:29:25] <championofsomeone> bodyguard
[2:29:26] <Joeggernaut777> Do whatever you want man
[2:29:26] <%Too_Much_Nukie> but you have to back out first.
[2:29:26] <%Jekado> kinda doesn't matter
[2:29:26] <xcalibar2> hero and breaker
[2:29:26] <%Dragon4234> everybody can kinda do whaterver
[2:29:26] <Blank9> stats mainly
[2:29:27] <%sarumanofmanycolors> Breaker
[2:29:27] <%Cn_alpha_02> Yes
[2:29:27] <%MrBorisMakarov> id go for breaker
[2:29:28] <%Monkeyweed21> Look at skills @PatStaresAt
[2:29:29] <hassanico2> @PatStaresAt Adachi's tanky right? And Nanba's a mage?
[2:29:30] <akitanito> You change as the battle demands
[2:29:30] <%BusterRepukken> Breaker is amazing
[2:29:30] <%AzureGale> Stats I guess
[2:29:30] <Dr00_PhD> internet
[2:29:30] <%promessav2> i would go for what looks cool. bodyguard
[2:29:30] <%Garthunox> anyone is good at anything
[2:29:31] <mattynezz> Their base class is a good hint
[2:29:31] <xcalibar2> are the best ones imo
[2:29:31] <@SSaryn> And just check Class abilties.
[2:29:32] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> Breaker is super fun
[2:29:32] <KingVantq> breaker or hero
[2:29:32] <%Jekado> breaker is fun though
[2:29:32] <%Deano8817> freelancer for WRASSLE
[2:29:33] <colzack_> By trying them out and seeing which you like
[2:29:33] <Jnkolm> they're all fine
[2:29:33] <$RealThiele> breaker mains
[2:29:33] <+Solutha> breaker is op aoe
[2:29:33] <%ShogunNoonto> hero
[2:29:34] <uncle_speeps> hero is ichi's best class but you should level up the others
[2:29:34] <star_feline> Keep hero imo
[2:29:34] <%Rofiarf> ichiban is good at dps, nanba is mage
[2:29:35] <+FlyingRamen> back out first?
[2:29:35] <huskarl_zap> Body guard will kill a enemy a turn
[2:29:35] <%Nekros4442> I would keep Kasuga as Hero
[2:29:38] <MasterTonberry23> pat just change class and go get in a fights, if you dont like it change it
[2:29:38] <%GeneralSCPatton> MAX EVERYONE IN EVERYTHING
[2:29:38] <%Cn_alpha_02> Hero
[2:29:39] <%bread_assassin> I'm liking Bodyguard.
[2:29:39] <%butthurtdave> Ichi is best as Hero, Adachi as Riot Police, Saeko as Idol
[2:29:39] <+talkingrain3139> Braker does crowd control
[2:29:39] <%Too_Much_Nukie> EVERYONE IS EQUAL
[2:29:40] <rosemon5001> wahh lvl one rank isnt as strong as something else BabyRage
[2:29:41] <austinj24> Stats
[2:29:41] <%coreyyotto> analyse the skills and compare to their derived stats
[2:29:42] <TheNewJapanGuy> Get Gud
[2:29:43] <NeroInfinite> now just do what you want really
[2:29:44] <televisedrevolting> I put like 10 into Bodyguard, then put the rest into Hero.
[2:29:44] <%eyezehuhh> breaker
[2:29:45] <+AbnormalVoid> Just give everyone every job
[2:29:48] <fuji_92> lvl skills pat
[2:29:48] <KingVantq> Adachi is good Enforcer
[2:29:48] <fIashman92> The red ball on the left means all class skill
[2:29:49] <%zajoestar> look it up online
[2:29:52] <kozboz96> red orb skills are cross class
[2:29:53] <%hahaha1171> look at base stats of your party and compare
[2:29:53] <CrankyVT> They can honestly excel at anything for the most part
[2:29:55] <%sighphers> b-b-but the canon class is hero
[2:29:56] <+omenoffate> Just play the game dude you can’t mess up lol
[2:29:56] <akitanito> You know you're just going to 30 everything, pat
[2:29:59] <%BoxNavy> :)
[2:30:00] <chancho4tierra> people says breaker
[2:30:01] <Joeggernaut777> @PatStaresAt Don't forget: You have other party members that can change jobs too
[2:30:01] <Blank9> You'll want everyone to get about 4 in all jobs for extra stats
[2:30:02] <%JaydenSai> @PatStaresAt I dunno, do what looks good to you
[2:30:03] <+zetaplus> hero is ichibans best class imo in the long run
[2:30:03] <%Monkeyweed21> bodyguard is glass cannon
[2:30:03] <wrydiculous> experiment around with jobs i'd think
[2:30:03] <%coreyyotto> also take into account who's serving which function in the party
[2:30:07] <Maleicus> red skills can be used by any job once acquired
[2:30:07] <meromaromiro> Fist sword are physical skills for Adachi and Ichiban Staff is Magical for Nanba
[2:30:07] <jcflyguy> Make anyone whatever you want, they'll be fine
[2:30:08] <+FlyingRamen> Ichi is great as Hero
[2:30:08] <%BigCoffee> foreman
[2:30:11] <%shunakiyama> Saeko as Idol for buffs and Ichi as Hero as it's the most well rounded class for ichi @PatStaresAt
[2:30:11] <Zarkith> You keep Character Skills even after you switch to other jobs
[2:30:12] <colzack_> You can switch jobs whenever you want and experiment as you like @PatStaresAt
[2:30:12] <%cobalt_phoenix_> psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin
[2:30:13] <%Blackmage9999> psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin
[2:30:14] <fIashman92> This is why I hate job systems. Choice paralysis
[2:30:14] <+AbnormalVoid> it doesn't really matter, they're all fairly good
[2:30:14] <%coreyyotto> honestly at this point in the game you can just pick anything and it'll work
[2:30:14] <+Link232> I'd stick with Hero 'cause Ichiban has Tarukaja and also mega/giga swing with Hero
[2:30:14] <%Nekros4442> Red ball means that the skill transfers to other classes when you job change
[2:30:15] <fuji_92> I'd stay hero imo
[2:30:16] <xcalibar2> you can always change it lol
[2:30:16] <Onamar> Just mess around
[2:30:18] <huskarl_zap> body guard
[2:30:18] <megaman_sentinel> don't let the goblins win pat
[2:30:19] <$StrawberryPantsu> I'd say stay Hero
[2:30:20] <Blank9> best to keep ichiban hero
[2:30:20] <TheNewJapanGuy> Experiment
[2:30:21] <%Rofiarf> stick with hero if you want
[2:30:21] <%butthurtdave> Red skills are universal and carry over to each of the character's classes
[2:30:23] <%yeknomlive> consider the weapons you have
[2:30:23] <Gameaholic42> You can always grind off screen
[2:30:23] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Red ball means you keep that skill for other jobs.
[2:30:23] <%Monkeyweed21> just read cumbo
[2:30:25] <+Devbot2> Look at the other character classes
[2:30:27] <@SSaryn> Would very much stay on Hero or go Breaker. Or do whatever.
[2:30:27] <%Piemono> Pat should just google this
[2:30:27] <CrankyVT> You can do whatever, but having 1 Musician or an Idol for healing/support would be a recommend
[2:30:27] <%dantegus> hero
[2:30:28] <colzack_> don't feel too pressured
[2:30:29] <$RealThiele> breaku
[2:30:29] <Monkey_D_Judd> playing through it rn and everyones can be anything pretty well. recommend getting super weapon at CAN minigame for hostess.
[2:30:29] <%Eaglestrike117> Hero
[2:30:29] <tsuchi7> I just keep it at hero cuz it looks cool
[2:30:30] <Blank9> he has very good unique skills in hero
[2:30:30] <%bevyrage> then go hero
[2:30:31] <KingVantq> you can change at anytime
[2:30:31] <+FlyingRamen> Saeko is rockin as an Idol
[2:30:32] <nmaten> just stay hero then
[2:30:33] <%Bailey__gaming> forman does big danqge
[2:30:33] <%Hotironclad> Just feels things out
[2:30:34] <mattynezz> Ichi is good as a Hero, he's fine
[2:30:34] <+AbnormalVoid> it's like 14 where you can just multi-class with everything @PatStaresAt
[2:30:35] <%BoxNavy> make ichi dps nanba healer adachi tank and saeko second dps
[2:30:36] <akitanito> yeyeyey
[2:30:37] <%coreyyotto> Nanba is a good musician
[2:30:38] <%charp35> you can also just stick with hero if you want
[2:30:39] <MasterTonberry23> pat dont worry about being optimal, youre not gearing up for ruby weapon
[2:30:40] <VritraReiRei> LUL
[2:30:41] <CelestialCage> jesus
[2:30:41] <%dantegus> chef
[2:30:42] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> keep him with Hero.
[2:30:43] <mattynezz> Nanba is a GREAT Host
[2:30:44] <sonofthedeepsouth> YES
[2:30:45] <huskarl_zap> HIP HOP SELLIN DRUGS TO THE KIDSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
[2:30:47] <GigaSeifer> Keep Kasuga as Hero, make Nanba a Chef, Adachi an Enforcer and Saeko an Idol
[2:30:48] <+FlyingRamen> Nanba homeless or musician I think
[2:30:49] <sonofthedeepsouth> RAPPER
[2:30:50] <akitanito> Get everyone as breaker
[2:30:52] <$RealThiele> he is king of bumfight
[2:30:53] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You could just keep the default jobs for now. they're also good
[2:30:54] <fIashman92> Make Nanba a musician for the all class heal aura
[2:30:56] <%shunakiyama> Nanba has high magic so should only do magic classes.
[2:30:56] <televisedrevolting> Just put Saeko as an idol then KEEP HER THERE
[2:30:59] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt Nothing right now takes advantage of Nanba's magic so keep him Homeless
[2:30:59] <CelestialCage> Breaker Nanba is nuts
[2:31:01] <+zetaplus> nanbas an amazing host
[2:31:02] <Blank9> I love adachi as a musician
[2:31:02] <%promessav2> all KISS
[2:31:03] <%twoto858> What's the max rank?
[2:31:03] <Joeggernaut777> This is actually incredible
[2:31:03] <CelestialCage> to look at
[2:31:04] <colzack_> Hero is an all rounder class so it wouldn't be a bad idea to keep him that
[2:31:05] <%dantegus> msician
[2:31:05] <%coreyyotto> Idol is GOAT
[2:31:05] <%butthurtdave> Idol is your dedicated healer
[2:31:05] <Maleicus> if you get rank 4 musician you get a whole party regeneration buff
[2:31:06] <$StrawberryPantsu> Idol

[2:31:12] <Zarkith> Idol is BUSTED for healing
[2:31:12] <%maskofmichael> Pat's greatest enemy, Numbers
[2:31:12] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Fuck off with Idol Saeko.
[2:31:12] <mattynezz> Adachi is a great Bodyguard or Musician
[2:31:12] <%Nekros4442> Hostess for DPS/Debuff, Idol for Support/Healer
[2:31:12] <+Greywyn00> night queen crikLiz

[2:31:15] <%stabbityrabbit> The hell is matriarch?
[2:31:15] <Blank9> hostess is BLACK MAGE, idol is WHITE MAGE
[2:31:16] <%BigCoffee> Pat everyone is good at everything, but level ups give stat bonuses so you want to swap around regularly. Everythig is good, it depends on your play style.
[2:31:17] <hassanico2> Idol has powerful buffs
[2:31:17] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Idol is dumb.
[2:31:18] <televisedrevolting> Actually wait I'm an idiot put some levels into Hostess
[2:31:18] <%AzureGale> Why she get fewer jobs
[2:31:19] <fIashman92> Idol has an all class heal skill

[2:31:22] <MarvelousMrD> i hear enforcer adachi is good

[2:32:01] <%zajoestar> idol=white mage
[2:32:01] <sonofthedeepsouth> END TINY HATS TIRANNY
[2:32:01] <%snugglepuggs> @patstaresat Hero is actually the best job but u will want to play and level up the other jobs to learn each character skill that sticks with your character. the second best is Breaker. but u never want to make Ichiban tank cuz it's game over if he dies. plus hero gets a rez too and heals. its really OP and the meta is having Namba as Musician, Adachi Enforcer for better tank skills, then Sae as Idol for amazing heals
[2:32:02] <%butthurtdave> Nanba as Musician is good
[2:32:03] <NitronStreams> "tiny"?
[2:32:05] <MasterTonberry23> not even gonna look at the other classes LUL
[2:32:07] <%coreyyotto> idol also gets pretty good weapons early on
[2:32:07] <fuji_92> check her other classes
[2:32:08] <GigaSeifer> Nanba as Chef
[2:32:08] <%dantegus> chef
[2:32:09] <%Hotironclad> Look at night queen @PatStaresAt
[2:32:09] <st_jimmy456> What do her locked jobs look like tho?
[2:32:09] <sonofthedeepsouth> BREAKER
[2:32:09] <CelestialCage> Breaker Nanba is hilarious
[2:32:11] <black_pariah> show the other jobs for saeko
[2:32:12] <%Garthunox> They're all fantastic
[2:32:15] <%Blackleafx> hes too stinky
[2:32:16] <%Cykron> Nanba looks like a hippie
[2:32:18] <%bevyrage> ALBUM DROP
[2:32:19] <NeroInfinite> TOo low yeah
[2:32:20] <mattynezz> Get him to Host when you can
[2:32:20] <colzack_> Musician Nanba is pretty good
[2:32:22] <%dantegus> no, chef
[2:32:24] <%Garthunox> Chef is amazing!
[2:32:27] <Blank9> nanba is good to stay homeless or musician
[2:32:27] <%hahaha1171> it's not a mage class
[2:32:29] <%GalacticaPhanto> Hes a folk singer lol
[2:32:29] <Guardiansaiyan> BREAKER
[2:32:30] <+AlphaRayAllen> Homeless or Chef, lad
[2:32:30] <mattynezz> Fortune Teller is also good
[2:32:31] <Blank9> until host
[2:32:31] <AlexDaGr8> "we are the globe" LUL
[2:32:32] <%sighphers> "scar me"
[2:32:32] <fIashman92> Chef is fun
[2:32:34] <star_feline> Anything that heals
[2:32:36] <%bread_assassin> I like Chef more.
[2:32:36] <%coreyyotto> musician gives him slightly better physical options, but also the debuffs and healing which work off his stats best
[2:32:37] <NeroInfinite> Chef
[2:32:37] <wrydiculous> chef seems good for him
[2:32:38] <$RealThiele> Allez cuisine!
[2:32:38] <%stabbityrabbit> Musician
[2:32:40] <+starzo0> did that say we are the globe?
[2:32:40] <%derekwst3> homeless chef
[2:32:41] <xcalibar2> honestly i picked idol for saeko cause the outfit is cute and found out later its like the best class lol
[2:32:41] <akitanito> Seems fitting for Nanba
[2:32:42] <%Garthunox> Absolutely go chef
[2:32:45] <CrankyVT> Chef is a melee DPS class essentially with a few fire elments
[2:32:45] <Maleicus> red skills can be used by any job so look out for those
[2:32:47] <cardamomo88> MUSICIAN
[2:32:47] <%shunakiyama> Nanba needs to be a mage. any other class than mage and nanba is useless
[2:32:48] <Fancypants25> chef
[2:32:48] <%snugglepuggs> musician is a debuffer/buffer
[2:32:49] <+AbnormalVoid> @PatStaresAt check skills
[2:32:50] <fIashman92> Get musicians all class singing
[2:32:50] <colzack_> By looking at their moves
[2:32:50] <uncle_speeps> musician and host namba are probably the best
[2:32:50] <hassanico2> @PatStaresAt Check the icons for moves
[2:32:50] <wrydiculous> chef got burn spells
[2:32:51] <%Monkeyweed21> look at the skills
[2:32:51] <%mield916> music is magic
[2:32:51] <%Mordexai0> Give me Break dancing Adachi
[2:32:52] <%McSoliace> check their stat gains
[2:32:52] <Blank9> chef is status infliction mixed damage
[2:32:53] <Daxalog> He made fish in cutscene
[2:32:55] <+Fusrahdo> Look at Magic stat without gear
[2:32:56] <Dr00_PhD> check the skills
[2:32:59] <fritz_dacat> muscian
[2:33:00] <%butthurtdave> Go Chef for more damage types
[2:33:00] <meromaromiro> Skills tell you physical or magical
[2:33:00] <%Emperor_Machinus> magic hobo
[2:33:00] <%snugglepuggs> Host is Black Mage
[2:33:00] <%BigCoffee> green chef
[2:33:01] <@SSaryn> Musician, Chef or Homeless is good for now
[2:33:03] <%TheMattman1313> The sword/cane symbols on the skills are probably a good indicator'
[2:33:03] <%penitentpendant> The fact that Chef gives fire resistance...
[2:33:08] <%AgniBrandt> The skills have icons.
[2:33:08] <CrankyVT> Musician is kinda like a red mage sorta? They're a little hard to define by FF terms
[2:33:09] <hassanico2> The icons Pat
[2:33:10] <mattynezz> Look at their weapons, weapons that heal MP on hit are a Magic Class
[2:33:11] <Blank9> adachi IS good as a breaker
[2:33:12] <xcalibar2> nanba is best as a mage
[2:33:13] <CelestialCage> I love this series
[2:33:13] <akitanito> You did it
[2:33:13] <%AgniBrandt> Magic ones have a staff I think
[2:33:16] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Musician and Chef both have magic.
[2:33:16] <%AzureGale> Yep
[2:33:20] <rosemon5001> if you choose jobs just from the start seeing negative stats you wont know what its rank ups will be
[2:33:20] <huskarl_zap> adachi should be a enforcer
[2:33:21] <hassanico2> @PatStaresAt Adachi is excellent at Enforcer!
[2:33:21] <Saltmeisterr> GUN MAN
[2:33:22] <%VHGS> Peppermill Blow is really weirdly strong.
[2:33:22] <akitanito> Enforcer
[2:33:22] <Fancypants25> he looks really stiff
[2:33:22] <%derekwst3> enforcer
[2:33:22] <%MyNameIsRasus> Def enforcer
[2:33:24] <%butthurtdave> Fist is blunt, Sword is Cut, and you can figure out Fire/Ice/Electric obviously
[2:33:24] <%Solipsist_Construct> Enforcer is great
[2:33:25] <%dantegus> music
[2:33:27] <GigaSeifer> yes, enforcer
[2:33:27] <%Monkeyweed21> It helps when you actually read Woolie @PatStaresAt
[2:33:27] <CelestialCage> Big boy
[2:33:29] <hassanico2> Prongs RULES!
[2:33:29] <%MrBorisMakarov> enforcer honestly
[2:33:29] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> Bodyguard gets a TIE
[2:33:29] <CrankyVT> The only job you can definitely describe with FF classes is Bodyguard as an OG Dark Knight
[2:33:30] <Dr00_PhD> wonderful what reading can do for understanding
[2:33:30] <fIashman92> Enforcer is a trap. No early equipment
[2:33:30] <%pectusumbra> @CrankyVT wouldn't musicians be bards?
[2:33:30] <%mield916> DO IT
[2:33:30] <+SilverDevilfish> SWAT time Kappa
[2:33:31] <NeroInfinite> yeah do it
[2:33:31] <%Nekros4442> Keep Detective until he gets Trule Helmbreaker imo
[2:33:31] <DublinRage> Pat can you read the other job descrip for Saeko?
[2:33:31] <akitanito> SWATMAN
[2:33:31] <%Mordexai0> BREAKER
[2:33:31] <%snugglepuggs> Enforcer
[2:33:32] <$StrawberryPantsu> Enforcer
[2:33:33] <wrydiculous> pretty obvious
[2:33:33] <UlriktheSlayer1> yeah
[2:33:34] <%coreyyotto> enforcer is good but all of the skills are high MP cost
[2:33:35] <%MyNameIsRasus> BREAKER THO
[2:33:35] <Blank9> bodyguard works too
[2:33:35] <%sighphers> oh god double-down on the police brutality
[2:33:36] <Joeggernaut777> Tank class!
[2:33:37] <mattynezz> Bodyguard is really good
[2:33:37] <meromaromiro> Yup Paralysis Prong is bamf
[2:33:39] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Chef is great btw.
[2:33:39] <GigaSeifer> the only problem is this early you don't really have a good weapon for enforcer
[2:33:39] <+AlphaRayAllen> Paralysis Prongs is overpowered as balls
[2:33:39] <star_feline> DATE
[2:33:39] <+tigerfang86> ONO MICHIO
[2:33:40] <%juxtest> I wonder what his class is
[2:33:40] <@SSaryn> Hes still great as Detective but he definitely excels at Enforcer
[2:33:41] <%stabbityrabbit> DATE OUTFIT
[2:33:41] <Blank9> and breaker
[2:33:41] <%Mordexai0> Do breaker
[2:33:42] <%MrBorisMakarov> DATE YEYEYE
[2:33:42] <%Too_Much_Nukie> DON'T.

[2:33:44] <%penitentpendant> Wow, the Date look
[2:33:46] <Blank9> he's good in any physical
[2:33:46] <NeroInfinite> army patterns
[2:33:48] <fIashman92> No early game enforcer gear
[2:33:49] <%butthurtdave> Enforcer is gonna be dry for a new weapon for quite a while
[2:33:49] <a_mad_dragon> DATE
[2:33:52] <+Xfire_exe> The problem with enforcer is finding weapons. The easiest one to get outside a dungeon is from the sewer casino.
[2:33:52] <$RealThiele> breaker in shambles
[2:33:52] <%butthurtdave> Only Red Skills
[2:33:53] <GigaSeifer> some do, not all

[2:33:54] <%Cykron> BLOOD KNIGHT
[2:33:55] <%Rofiarf> the red ones do
[2:33:55] <+AbnormalVoid> one bad thing about enforcer is that finding a new shield weapon is really hard
[2:33:56] <+Solutha> I made him breaker for the agility
[2:33:56] <$StrawberryPantsu> @AlphaRayAllen OH MY GOD IS IT
[2:33:56] <%Nekros4442> Only the skills with the red orb on em

[2:33:56] <CrankyVT> Uuuh sorta like bards I guess yeah.

[2:34:15] <KingVantq> @butthurtdave yeah I still haven't found one
[2:34:16] <%BoxNavy> yes
[2:34:16] <GigaSeifer> correct
[2:34:16] <rosemon5001> you can make him into DATE
[2:34:16] <akitanito> Yes
[2:34:16] <+abrupt_abe> Do stats carry over?
[2:34:17] <NeroInfinite> Yes
[2:34:17] <cardamomo88> yes
[2:34:18] <%MyNameIsRasus> Yes
[2:34:18] <Blank9> peppermill and STATS will carry over
[2:34:19] <%coreyyotto> you get 2 character skills per job
[2:34:20] <$StrawberryPantsu> Keep Nanba as Homless
[2:34:21] <CrankyVT> I will still yell that Bodyguard has the best early red orb skill
[2:34:21] <hassanico2> You will permanently keep SOME of them even after switching classes
[2:34:23] <%TheMattman1313> So arguably level to those
[2:34:24] <%Nekros4442> Stats are permanent as well
[2:34:25] <%zajoestar> red skills do
[2:34:28] <GigaSeifer> yes, exactly
[2:34:28] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Yes
[2:34:28] <akitanito> yes
[2:34:28] <meromaromiro> Stat boosts also carry over
[2:34:28] <%Dragon4234> @PatStaresAt All the stat upgrades are permant too
[2:34:29] <+AlphaRayAllen> And all the stat boosts are yours to keep too
[2:34:30] <%Jekado> I think those stat increase are permnant also
[2:34:30] <fIashman92> Check out musicians early character skill
[2:34:31] <fuji_92> skills and stats
[2:34:31] <@SSaryn> Correct
[2:34:32] <%snugglepuggs> yes
[2:34:34] <mattynezz> Stats too
[2:34:36] <reonome> stats are permanent
[2:34:36] <$RealThiele> hey who doesnt love a good peppermill blow?
[2:34:36] <$StrawberryPantsu> YES
[2:34:37] <CrankyVT> Stage 3 attack boost
[2:34:40] <%sighphers> i love how the interface has the character's resume on the side
[2:34:40] <%butthurtdave> Adachi won't get a new weapon for quite a while, not till Chapter 8
[2:34:44] <Blank9> the stat buffs also carry over
[2:34:44] <%derekwst3> body guard also looks good
[2:34:45] <%Too_Much_Nukie> The stat increases are also permanent yes
[2:34:45] <%coreyyotto> Power/Mind Charge, basically
[2:34:45] <+Link232> Oh Enforcer just gets Charge, huh
[2:34:47] <Blank9> foreman sucks
[2:34:48] <%VHGS> The stat boosts listed on the skill screen carry over. The regular stats you get from job level obviously don't.
[2:34:49] <mattynezz> It's Charge, basically
[2:34:49] <@SSaryn> Bodyguard just gets Focus.
[2:34:50] <%weissguard> For Example: Adachi has Reckless Charge from his first Job. As well as another one.
[2:34:50] <GigaSeifer> Megaton Throw is GREAT
[2:34:51] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> Nanba doesn't sign his name in Kanji
[2:34:52] <colzack_> Yeah and the stat ups you get from job rank ups stick around too
[2:34:54] <+AlphaRayAllen> You need foreman for literally two seconds
[2:34:54] <@SSaryn> Its fantastic.
[2:34:55] <%Monkeyweed21> MEGATON THROW
[2:34:55] <%WhereIsWill> bodyguard yeyeye
[2:34:57] <akitanito> C outfit looks rad
[2:34:58] <mattynezz> Yeah
[2:34:58] <PE4X> yes also the stat increases (+5 attack) does also transfer from job to job
[2:34:59] <$StrawberryPantsu> Foreman is only good for unlocking black market @PatStaresAt
[2:35:05] <%chiazam> KTANA
[2:35:07] <%shunakiyama> be foreman just for the exploration ability and then switch after the exploration ability unlocks @PatStaresAt
[2:35:08] <hassanico2> @PatStaresAt Paralysis Prongs is Foreman's best skill early on
[2:35:09] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Foreman is mostly good for throwing dynamite.
[2:35:10] <%Cn_alpha_02> Stats carry over as well.
[2:35:11] <Vismal> megaton throw pa
[2:35:11] <fIashman92> Enforcer doesn't get any early gear
[2:35:12] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt WAIT exit the menu first before you do that
[2:35:12] <akitanito> Give him the glasses pat
[2:35:13] <%snugglepuggs> don't level up forman just equip it and leave screen then switch off of it
[2:35:14] <$StrawberryPantsu> No
[2:35:14] <%butthurtdave> Yes
[2:35:15] <hassanico2> Er, Enforcer
[2:35:16] <%Nekros4442> yes
[2:35:17] <fIashman92> Yes

[2:35:20] <@SSaryn> Ye
[2:35:21] <%BoxNavy> they gave you a katana
[2:35:22] <NeroInfinite> yes
[2:35:22] <CelestialCage> yes
[2:35:22] <meromaromiro> Yes
[2:35:23] <Louie_Salmon> You should equip all the jobs just for a second regardless
[2:35:23] <%Garthunox> i think you need to back out first
[2:35:25] <mattynezz> I think you need to exit this screen
[2:35:25] <fuji_92> yes
[2:35:26] <%coreyyotto> no because you only have green skills
[2:35:29] <Blank9> not the battle ones though
[2:35:30] <meromaromiro> Yellow dots from explore and stats are for all
[2:35:35] <%Rofiarf> you can buy high level weapons from the weapon shop at china town in the top right of map.
[2:35:36] <PE4X> Chef and Fortuneteller is really good
[2:35:36] <%honeyman18> once you have it unlocked each time, you can switch later
[2:35:37] <+TDAWS_MP132> yes
[2:35:37] <%Jekado> it depends on the job
[2:35:38] <%snugglepuggs> not all the time
[2:35:40] <+CherteuseKapibara> majima class
[2:35:41] <%maskofmichael> Job Juice
[2:35:41] <dretheroboticdeer> Wasn’t there a really good fire katana earlier?

[2:35:47] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Yes.
[2:35:48] <%butthurtdave> Also Enforcer is great on Adachi but he will not get any new weapons for a LONG time
[2:35:49] <GarbageQueenEllie> job juice, pork it up
[2:35:51] <%snugglepuggs> some give u character skill at 10

[2:36:24] <%AzureGale> I want to be an idol ;_;
[2:36:25] <%Jekado> if you mark off every job for her you can unlock a secret substory for her but you need to have a high social stat for that

[2:38:17] <%butthurtdave> Adachi won't get a new weapon for a very long time
[2:38:18] <%BusterRepukken> enforcer is one of the best jobs in the game
[2:38:19] <%derekwst3> @PatStaresAt secret shop
[2:38:20] <Blank9> you'll get lots of weapons from safes or sidequests
[2:38:23] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah that's their default gear, very weak
[2:38:25] <Blank9> more than you can use
[2:38:25] <%BoxNavy> time to grind
[2:38:26] <xcalibar2> make the soda bastard wand for saeko bro >>>
[2:38:26] <%Jekado> you didn't give her haruka's costume?!?
[2:38:27] <%coreyyotto> Gear is another consideration when choosing jobs
[2:38:29] <ovan20> @PatStaresAt you can craft some of the gear for the new classes
[2:38:35] <PE4X> go buy stuff
[2:38:35] <%BusterRepukken> adachi just becomes the tank with it
[2:38:35] <%yeknomlive> you can craft some
[2:38:37] <Joeggernaut777> Gotta go grind for new stuff bro

[2:40:24] <%penitentpendant> A good poll question for next Yakuza Stream: How much grinding off-screen was done
[2:40:26] <Blank9> they keep character specific skills in all classes
[2:40:30] <%Jekado> still have breaking top too
[2:40:30] <KidKaiser23> Jus came from the podcast, heard the high praise for this game, excited to watch more and potentially pick up after I Platinum Spider-Man:MM
[2:40:33] <%Rofiarf> the picture indicates the job it comes from

[2:40:56] <Copperama> This is the first I'm ever seeing of this game, IS THIS WHAT YAKUZA 7 IS???
[2:41:00] <%sighphers> nanba is dual wielding whisks
[2:41:04] <%BusterRepukken> @Hotironclad In the river, you gotta go down a ladder, guarded by two dudes.
[2:41:18] <akitanito> MAGICAL SLAP
[2:41:18] <%penitentpendant> Also, it's nice that low level areas still exist so you can grind newer classes without too much fuss
[2:41:18] <MasterTonberry23> isnt saeko too old to be an idol?
[2:41:19] <%butthurtdave> I wish you could mix and match weapons from each class
[2:41:26] <%promessav2> wow really cool how the animations change
[2:41:27] <Admiral_PopnFresh> is there an intel class that tells you what are weak or strong against certain enemies?
[2:41:29] <+gespenst25> Fuck, I need that idol outfit...

[2:44:58] <%shunakiyama> it's definitely a cat in game LUL
[2:44:59] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah we're sure.
[2:45:03] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt If Snitchiban is the opposite of kiryu does that mean he killed that guy?

[2:45:13] <%Rofiarf> trying getting whacked with a whisk pat
[2:45:15] <%emperordread> It's their one WHISKness
[2:45:15] <huskarl_zap> Whisks are basically maces
[2:45:15] <ovan20> weak to blunt attacks
[2:45:15] <Midnight188> wait until Elmo learns the secret technique of eating all the dog's food before he gets a chance to eat.

[2:45:29] <NeroInfinite> TOld ya
[2:45:31] <%heartlesshealer> whisk is not a type in and of itself, the whisk is a weapon that deals a specific damage type
[2:45:36] <%penitentpendant> Cat acquired!
[2:45:36] <%Dragon4234> @PatStaresAt There's 6 types of damage on the right side on the stats

[2:45:53] <+Xfire_exe> Pat, shields for enforcer are hard to come by, the easiest upgrade is bought at the sewer casino
[2:45:54] <st_jimmy456> GUN
[2:45:57] <%MrBorisMakarov> G U N
[2:45:59] <Joeggernaut777> Jesus there's alot of garbage in that river
[2:46:00] <%Jekado> next one is near that god statue wall
[2:46:04] <star_feline> GUN Damage
[2:46:04] <st_jimmy456> the power of GUN
[2:46:05] <mattynezz> Electric is pretty much always best

[2:46:38] <mattynezz> Hobo isn't very good
[2:46:39] <%Jekado> cat coming up i think
[2:46:39] <%butthurtdave> also a little heads up Bodyguard is the only Male Job that deals Cut damage with its basic attack and Dealer is the only Female Job that does Cut as well, the rest are Blunt by default with the exception of later party members' unique classes
[2:46:40] <GigaSeifer> CAT

[2:55:34] <+AbnormalVoid> @PatStaresAt there are various strong single enemies around
[2:55:35] <skyentombment> Hey guys, is it possible for Saeko to be a C.Viper kinda character?
[2:55:40] <star_feline> the fuck is this time traveler ass?
[2:55:43] <taquito_blade> this is great how they just casualy mix in Japanese with English here n there
[2:55:44] <%Too_Much_Nukie> These guys can show up randomly, they're minibosses that can also pop out of safes.
[2:55:45] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> Also this is almost Kuze's theme
[2:55:47] <sonicblade38> why does he have an AT barrier!?
[2:55:47] <%yeknomlive> i mean compared to other encounters
[2:55:52] <%sighphers> do you have to be closer?
[2:55:54] <VritraReiRei> The Tag Team Specials and Summons are cool but I still miss Heat Moves FeelsBadMan
[2:55:57] <MasterTonberry23> Your momma wears army boots and your dad, uh, has really patchy skin!
[2:56:01] <mattynezz> That move never seems to work
[2:56:03] <Dr00_PhD> Anytime you see a lone enemy they're stronger than regular encounters
[2:56:04] <%Emperor_Machinus> when we get Mr. shakedown?
[2:56:05] <sponsoredviewer910> LUL
[2:56:06] <KingVantq> @too_much_nukie that one might be a spoiler

[2:56:13] <taquito_blade> @sighphers it automatically closes the gap
[2:56:13] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Idol is a support class, don't forget to support.
[2:56:16] <%brachydios777> DROPKICK
[2:56:17] <Ultimatefool> @skyentombment The closest is Hostess which has fire and ice elementals, I don't think there is a punch girl sadly
[2:56:21] <Joeggernaut777> Man who is this guy?
[2:56:21] <MasterTonberry23> @VritraReiRei It tilts me so much its "MP" and not "Heat"
[2:56:25] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Pat already knows there's mimics though.
[2:56:29] <%Divryne> Divryne subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 28 months, currently on a 28 month streak! Hey Pat have you ever watched a """reaction""" video but the person reacting starts the recording before they've clicked the video, and the red bar in the thumbnail is full? Well if not have you seen any other shit that outs someone as a huge fraud?

[2:59:43] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt Being drunk in this game gives characters a chance to ignore commands.

[2:59:56] <$lotharrio> Pat, did you unlock Ichiban's traversal power at Hello Work?
[3:00:01] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt Being drunk also makes Saeko deal more damage.
[3:00:07] <fIashman92> You missed it again
[3:00:11] <%heartlesshealer> haywire <3

[3:00:19] <madtrixr> and he did a fight and that took a level off the drunk status
[3:00:19] <%Rofiarf> also might attack each opther
[3:00:22] <Joeggernaut777> Careful Pat, drunk party members can accidentaly attack your other party members
[3:00:30] <mattynezz> @lotharrio He did
[3:00:32] <fuji_92> being drunk makes them all deal more dmg
[3:00:33] <%heartlesshealer> but yeah you missed combo from only getting all food with one drink
[3:00:34] <%BoxNavy> jermaOneguy just move on
[3:00:45] <taquito_blade> thats alil funny
[3:00:47] <%Too_Much_Nukie> It's funny because being drunk is a buff in every Kiryu game.
[3:00:50] <taquito_blade> friendly fire
[3:00:50] <$lotharrio> Okay, just checking since that's an easy one to miss.
[3:00:58] <%Too_Much_Nukie> In this game some enemies will make you drunk as a debuff.
[3:00:59] <%heartlesshealer> you can get it later though
[3:01:06] <+Xfire_exe> double stab
[3:01:06] <%yeknomlive> she just ignore that attack?
[3:01:15] <a_mad_dragon> nanba with the fucking geno whirl
[3:01:17] <+Fusrahdo> yo she ignored that block

[3:02:18] <%bevyrage> pat while you're here, snap a pic of the kappa upstairs in the closet please!
[3:02:21] <+Xfire_exe> honestly its because Pat's using starter weapons on Bodyguard and enforcer
[3:02:22] <+AbnormalVoid> @PatStaresAt story progress required
[3:02:22] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Enforcer is a fantastic job for endgame but you need better weapons for it and those are hard to get. You also need to make sure the person has high MP for Enforcer's skills.
[3:02:23] <%LuckyLagomorph> story-locked
[3:02:24] <melonsouda> probably need to advance the story
[3:02:27] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt Nanba past Level 3 requires MSQ progression
[3:02:27] <$lotharrio> Nanba doesn't seem to like sharig.
[3:02:29] <%penitentpendant> MSQ progression required?

[3:06:45] <%maenos2> this is going to be a total misunderstanding again isn't it
[3:06:47] <%Monkeyweed21> @KidKaiser23 whore house where whores bathe your penis
[3:06:48] <Ultimatefool> You worked there for one day Ichiban LUL
[3:06:49] <ammobasket> For FIVE MINUTES
[3:06:49] <%BoxNavy> @KidKaiser23 women bathe you and a sex happens
[3:06:52] <%Mordexai0> you worked when she was WASN'T THERE ICHI
[3:06:52] <%T_Sasquatch> LUL
[3:06:54] <Louie_Salmon> @KidKaiser23 Place where ladies rub the penis, but the classy front is baths
[3:06:55] <Xelgus> you think the VAs ever go "hang on, haven't I voiced this already?"
[3:06:57] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Can't let my sister know I was sellin it on the streets.
[3:06:58] <ShichiNoBushi> He met her once since he started working there.
[3:06:59] <dinnydanny777> Oh yeah, Ichiban, the totally not criminal
[3:06:59] <fuji_92> DAMMIT ICHIBAN LUL
[3:06:59] <%sumrand0> Smack some sense into her, with her logic that's probably the best way to make her agree (he beats me because he cares!)
[3:07:00] <$lotharrio> Too bad she doesn't know about how Ichiban saved her dad from being euthanasia'd.
[3:07:01] <%sighphers> awwww

[3:07:38] <%Mordexai0> YOU WORKED THERE FOR LIKE 3 DAYS ICHI
[3:07:39] <televisedrevolting> @quinn_carter Brothel
[3:07:40] <T_Sasquatch> KappaPride
[3:07:43] <%heartlesshealer> ichiban may be a huge dork, but he's a good friend
[3:07:51] <%BoxNavy> LVL UP
[3:07:55] <+Fusrahdo> Ichiban or Japanese Eric Andre?
[3:07:57] <%Monkeyweed21> Its cuz you drank the baby bottle @PatStaresAt
[3:07:59] <$lotharrio> Killed a bunch of dudes and collected a lot of cans while running over the homeless, eh?
[3:08:00] <oAznoUta> Saeko will take a mortal blow for you
[3:08:00] <Jonny_Uppercut> @sighphers Yeah but Kiryu was also basically a dad so he was past hitting on women
[3:08:04] <%BoxNavy> jermaMustard
[3:08:04] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Passion is the easiest to level since there's so many conversation options that raise it.
[3:08:06] <PkSilent01> @Quinn_Carter A Brothal but you take a bath in
[3:08:09] <KidKaiser23> @fusrahdo Yes
[3:08:14] <%FacetiousAF> pee break PogChamp
[3:08:15] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[3:08:17] <%heartlesshealer> adachi, tell us about being piss poor
[3:08:32] <%MechArch> gonna clean those poop pants
[3:08:34] <%DedlokPM> @Quinn_Carter Legal loophole brothel where you pay to have women "wash" you with soap lathered on their body while you lay on a mat
[3:08:34] <KidKaiser23> Wait so at the Soapland, do you bathe before or after you fuck the Whores?
[3:08:47] <%MelBrooksKA> @Jonny_Uppercut unmarried dads can still hit on women, they do it all the time
[3:08:51] <%DedlokPM> @KidKaiser23 during
[3:08:51] <+OldManJEWc> Well, so much for watching the stream during Praetorium cutscenes 🤷🏿♂️
[3:08:53] <GigaSeifer> both
[3:08:53] <%DakotaMacDoodle> Ichiban was not cut out for the long term Yakuza lifestyle he is to good of a person
[3:08:55] <$lotharrio> Yo Adachi, why'd you spend all your money on whores and orphans?! Hahahah!
[3:08:56] <%sighphers> @Jonny_Uppercut yeah that's fair, but the vibes with saeko and ichi are still pretty platonic
[3:08:57] <%coreyyotto> @KidKaiser23 before AND after, if yo're doing it right
[3:08:58] <%pectusumbra> @KidKaiser23 yes
[3:09:02] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Fun fact: If you have the management DLC that lets you have cameos work for your companies, Date's bio says he's an old friend of Adachi's.
[3:09:36] <huskarl_zap> oh thats dlc
[3:09:45] <huskarl_zap> I wondered why it was so easy
[3:09:45] <KidKaiser23> Thanks lol, y’all are awesome and super helpful
[3:09:45] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Ichiban is a good person but he also loves crime in a way Kiryu didn't.
[3:10:04] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Like he was totally down with Nonomiya being a bastard while he ran his whore house. Saw no problems with it.

[3:24:39] <h0wiewong> Let's see what happens to it next
[3:24:40] <StarlitStunner> Ocelot nemuPog
[3:24:40] <%zajoestar> dead
[3:24:41] <ShichiNoBushi> "You're pretty good!"
[3:24:42] <fIashman92> Go in the bar and leave for mission'
[3:24:44] <+GeneralGray8> I have been watching this game for 30 mins and I have come to the conclusion that it is literally the best game I have ever seen
[3:24:46] <jorniev> WE ONLY FEEL ALIVE ON THE BATTLEFIELD
[3:24:55] <%rumtumtugnutz> it's not gonna stay safve is it
[3:24:57] <KidKaiser23> The Most Dangerous Game
[3:24:57] <mattynezz> Yup
[3:25:03] <akitanito> How much planting has pat done so far?
[3:25:04] <%ClericOfSparda> that scope sucked
[3:25:04] <%McSoliace> yup
[3:25:04] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah and by 5 you usually have a feel for what the job plays like.
[3:25:05] <%Rofiarf> mp
[3:25:08] <Joeggernaut777> Persimmon is a crazy man's fruit
[3:25:11] <+teg88> MP
[3:25:12] <HotMafia81> And with his dying breath he said, "Hey man, can you beat me up again once I buy a new gun?" He then breathed his last, and passed to the next life.
[3:25:13] <%FacetiousAF> fuck that move
[3:25:14] <+Fusrahdo> MP
[3:25:16] <mattynezz> Eventually EXP gets MUCH larger and it's not reallya problem though
[3:25:19] <%MyNameIsRasus> MP
[3:25:19] <black_pariah> checked out for a bit, has he gone to the warehouse yet?
[3:25:19] <%derekwst3> @PatStaresAt mp
[3:25:22] <%Monkeyweed21> need to be lower MP
[3:25:23] <+AbnormalVoid> low accuracy, always crit @PatStaresAt
[3:25:23] <%heartlesshealer> READ THE MOVE
[3:25:23] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Bodyguard skills have low chance to hit.
[3:25:24] <fIashman92> Go in the bar and leave for perrsimmon'
[3:25:25] <Maleicus> get more dex
[3:25:32] <Zarkith> I have NEVER seen Thoughtless Skewer whiff that frequently
[3:25:33] <%T_Sasquatch> I really wonder if this game will succeed
[3:25:34] <%DedlokPM> @PatStaresAt psaWrong It was MP not HP
[3:25:38] <fuji_92> read the movd
[3:25:40] <akitanito> Read bodyguard skills
[3:25:43] <%rumtumtugnutz> Is the hostess supposed to be a magical girl
[3:25:45] <JaceDarkstar> I dont like that job for ichiban
[3:25:46] <huskarl_zap> that mission would of been better with vergil in the party
[3:25:47] <%zajoestar> wtf only had it miss once
[3:25:47] <%Jekado> yeah once you unlock dungeon its much easier to grind
[3:25:51] <%shunakiyama> Honestly Hero is ichibans most well rounded skill. Access to healing abilities and revive abilities. Plus decent AOE attacks
[3:25:55] <invalidarg56> what chapter?
[3:25:57] <%Hotironclad> Hotironclad subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! 
[3:26:01] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Dex is what determines accuracy though.
[3:26:03] <DashXero> Bodyguard looks like it sucks.
[3:26:03] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Not agility.
[3:26:08] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Oh
[3:26:11] <london_flexing> bodyguard is like berserker class then?
[3:26:18] <Zarkith> @invalidarg56 Middle of 5
[3:26:19] <%shiplord13> Five dollars that that a Yakuza shows up to kill the fruit next
[3:26:21] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah it is.
[3:26:22] <akitanito> Pat just needs big dex
[3:26:25] <Jnkolm> how would reading the description help? That move hits normally
[3:26:27] <+AXL808> having a cast that sticks with you from now on really changes the yakuza feel compared to Kiryu and it's amazing
[3:26:33] <Blank9> hero's a good one to level for ichi since he doesn't get a job bonus item, and it's strong with good skills
[3:26:34] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Low accuracy, with high power but recoil.
[3:26:36] <%Monkeyweed21> time for SOUP
[3:26:39] <%heartlesshealer> yay persimmon safety
[3:26:44] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Some moves are guaranteed crits.
[3:26:51] <%MyNameIsRasus> Kiryu himself will show up to kick that persimmon's ass
[3:26:55] <%McSoliace> nanba's fast as hell
[3:27:03] <$narfi_steadfast> Pat i can't decide between this and Granblue
[3:27:12] <%mighty_max_t> 3
[3:27:16] <$narfi_steadfast> ye
[3:27:19] <%Mordexai0> @narfi_steadfast this
[3:27:21] <%heartlesshealer> hmm
[3:27:21] <+AbnormalVoid> this Kappa
[3:27:21] <madtrixr> one of the bodyguard attacks is "low hit high crit"
[3:27:24] <$narfi_steadfast> ok
[3:27:25] <%McSoliace> this it has better netcode LUL
[3:27:26] <madtrixr> not all of them
[3:27:26] <%xcompleasedad> 45 cents LUL
[3:27:26] <ThatGuyThere03> yeah
[3:27:27] <%FacetiousAF> i would assume this, GBVS has like... no one playing
[3:27:28] <Maleicus> no just 60 bucks on gatcha
[3:27:30] <%AzureGale> Do you like fighting games or RPGs more
[3:27:31] <%MyNameIsRasus> Granblue doesn't even have rollback
[3:27:34] <fuji_92> get this LUL
[3:27:34] <KingVantq> This
[3:27:35] <%penitentpendant> Influencer powers... GO
[3:27:36] <%T_Sasquatch> When's that granblue RPG thooo
[3:27:36] <lucky_icarus> I love Granblie but yeah, THIS
[3:27:36] <alwayspronking> This will last longer and is probably funnier
[3:27:39] <skyentombment> CLOBBERSAURUS
[3:27:39] <%Blackleafx> COP
[3:27:43] <%sighphers> "buy this" hahahah
[3:27:43] <+illusiveSaint> THROW HIM IN THE WATER
[3:27:46] <uncle_speeps> this because it isn't granblue
[3:27:51] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Medium Well is a better pyro breath.
[3:27:51] <fuji_92> why play granblue when u can play this
[3:27:51] <%AzureGale> If you play the Granblue browser game get that instead
[3:27:51] <thegreatsun> buff him MORE
[3:27:55] <%honeyman18> more fun here
[3:27:57] <+Gespens> @narfi_steadfast only buy GBVS on the PS4 if you play the gacha game, for the bonuses. The game's balance has gone to shit lately
[3:27:57] <huskarl_zap> MURDERED
[3:28:00] <%BoxNavy> JESUS NANBA

[3:28:51] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Knight of the Cask is my favorite early-game sujimon.
[3:28:52] <huskarl_zap> knight of the cask is a great name
[3:29:00] <skyentombment> Bear in mind, if you buy Yakuza, you're really buying like 10 games or more for the price of one
[3:29:05] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Yes.

[3:29:20] <%sighphers> how does the chef look more terrifying than the enforcer in swat gear
[3:29:21] <st_jimmy456> The sujimon evolved
[3:29:21] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Their sujidex entry explains they're rennaissance nerds.
[3:29:22] <%MyNameIsRasus> Enemies scale
[3:29:22] <%shunakiyama> Yeah all normal types upgrade it's pretty cool

[3:46:07] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Enforcer is a great job but I really recommend saving it for when you've got a better shield and Adachi has some higher MP.
[3:46:08] <+zanzibar_junker> Breaker is good

[3:51:13] <mattynezz> Ichiban was raised in a whore house, he definitley knows what it is
[3:51:14] <dexdestroyazz> Ichiban cant be extorted with nudes cause he doesnt know what sex is

[3:51:29] <%T_Sasquatch> I'll still keep buying their "same game" . Personally i know i just don't like turn based games. I've tried many times
[3:51:31] <Owkono> this looks sweet
[3:51:31] <st_jimmy456> ichi definitely knows what sex is
[3:51:32] <%NovaKnightmare> Ichiban probably knows what sex is, he isnt Kiryu
[3:51:35] <%roscoe_rosaline> @joylent_blue I am very close to doing the same.
[3:51:37] <+SilverDevilfish> Ichiban most DEFINATELY knows what sex is

[3:51:59] <Blank9> hostess and idol are both amazing for saeko
[3:52:00] <%McSoliace> he's a power virgin though
[3:52:01] <Saltmeisterr> enforcer seems like it needs good gear
[3:52:04] <%Kataguro> You need better weapons is all
[3:52:11] <%chiazam> @NovaKnightmare HE defintly knows, but is still a probable virgin
[3:52:12] <%T_Sasquatch> Ichiban absolutely fucks
[3:52:12] <dexdestroyazz> I mean, he IS pretty dumb tho
[3:52:15] <%rumtumtugnutz> Ichiban wants to bang, but he's bad at ladies. Kiryu was good at ladies but didn't know what sex was.
[3:52:15] <jcflyguy> Idol needs magic attacks :/
[3:52:16] <%Too_Much_Nukie> If you ever reach a point where you want Saeko to do something else, Nanba as Musician is also a good support choice.
[3:52:17] <Blank9> hostess does insane damage
[3:52:17] <%miguelrod777> he knows what sex is but he is a virgin

[3:53:28] <uncle_speeps> adachi has a lot of crowd control moves so him being fast is good
[3:53:29] <mattynezz> He's actually really good as a musician, since Musician builds up to big ass melee finishers

[3:54:21] <%Too_Much_Nukie> For this early in the game it's not good.
[3:54:26] <Guardiansaiyan> @lotharrio lol
[3:54:27] <%heartlesshealer> the mp cost is big though
[3:54:30] <%Solipsist_Construct> paralysis prongs is amazing
[3:54:31] <%heartlesshealer> on prongs
[3:54:32] <%coreyyotto> Breakers skills are great though
[3:54:34] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Breaker is also limited to 1 damage type.
[3:54:36] <%sighphers> i miss hero tbh
[3:54:38] <uncle_speeps> wait until you have a good weapon for enforcer and then try it out
[3:54:39] <madtrixr> its big but its so worth it
[3:54:41] <CrankyVT> Breaker is great for area clear and mp self-sustain with one of its moves
[3:54:43] <jcflyguy> Breakers skills double as buffs
[3:54:43] <GandhiTheTerrible> honestly, hero is solid
[3:54:46] <+Solutha> Breakers are aoe monsters with self buffing attacks
[3:54:47] <CrankyVT> but it is limited to only blunt element damage
[3:54:49] <%McSoliace> neither does hero tbf
[3:54:49] <Blank9> hero is incredible and that level 16 skill is busted
[3:54:51] <+Shikari21> Is bodyguard good chat?
[3:54:54] <TundraOW> iirc breaker has unblockable moves

[4:02:25] <+omenoffate> Funny how the na version is missing the weakness marker during battle after you have them in the dex
[4:02:28] <+Pharmakokinetic> I had no idea the new yakuza is now just straight up an RPG
[4:02:33] <dinnydanny777> Get serious, says the 60 year old break dancing LUL
[4:02:38] <Jnkolm> the management game's story is that the bad guys are gonna stop you. That's it
[4:02:38] <mattynezz> The Martial Artist enemy groups are definitely the strongest early game enemies
[4:02:52] <ulcaban> I love how Kasuga always staggers after the big swing

[4:03:09] <%chiazam> Hey Pat, is there a menu in-battle to see what enemies are WEAK and STRONG to?
[4:03:16] <%Nekros4442> @man_boob cus it's fun
[4:03:17] <akitanito> No, yakuza is DQ
[4:03:18] <theotrainwreck> @man_boob because
[4:03:20] <%MyNameIsRasus> @man_boob it's actually dragon quest persona
[4:03:20] <%Too_Much_Nukie> It's not Final Fantasy it's Dragon Quest.
[4:03:21] <%roscoe_rosaline> Dragon Quest*
[4:03:23] <mattynezz> HOLY SHIT, I just realized why the excuse for Kiryu not being in Tekken is REALLY STUPID

[4:04:06] <Sulfur_Boride> I kinda want the next Yakuza game to play like FF7 remake so it can keep some of the classic beat-em-up elements while still being able to play as the other characters.
[4:04:08] <%TheBensonator_> benson10Pog benson10Pog benson10Pog
[4:04:11] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You get 1 million yen for finding all cats btw Pat.
[4:04:12] <%BubbaRands> CAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT psaPorgmo
[4:04:26] <VritraReiRei> God, this is just like Yakuza 6 minus the cat food
[4:04:30] <%mighty_max_t> pizplexCharlesconcern psaBlep
[4:04:31] <randomahole> is this combat/theme better as a one-off or should this be the new direction for Yakuza for a while?
[4:04:56] <%T_Sasquatch> NO
[4:04:57] <%BoxNavy> so... you grinded a bit off stream
[4:04:58] <huskarl_zap> a mere million? LUL
[4:04:58] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Agreed.
[4:04:59] <GandhiTheTerrible> i'm good with that
[4:05:00] <%Hotironclad> Agreed
[4:05:03] <+Mrbaconator> what would they add? @PatStaresAt
[4:05:04] <SoySocks> so just do what dragon quest does
[4:05:07] <+preppyposs> they implemented the RPG elements REALLY WELL
[4:05:08] <%T_Sasquatch> Bad
[4:05:09] <madtrixr> hell yeah
[4:05:11] <Saltmeisterr> Agrred
[4:05:15] <$roscoe_rosaline> Hell yeah, it looks so good.
[4:05:15] <theotrainwreck> Kappa Kappa
[4:05:15] <MasterTonberry23> On that note Judgment should be its own thing and continue the beat em up style
[4:05:17] <+AbnormalVoid> it needs refinement, that's for sure
[4:05:17] <%MyNameIsRasus> Having some way to control positioning would add some cool depth
[4:05:17] <%promessav2> i'd like manual positioning and attack aiming
[4:05:21] <devanmuse> judge eyes for action, like a dragon for rpg?
[4:05:21] <%toastybites> dynamax Yakuza
[4:05:23] <TheNewJapanGuy> I think there should be balance between old and new
[4:05:24] <%Too_Much_Nukie> I'd like them to keep having brawler games at times too, but I really hope they don't treat this as a one-off.
[4:05:27] <SoySocks> just gotta add an airship to travel the world in next time and you're golden
[4:05:32] <%Monkeyweed21> the next step would be to add a Kiwami Limit Break bar
[4:05:34] <%BoxNavy> TO DEATH
[4:05:38] <@commanderclaw> This game is basically using the Chrono Trigger system, I just realized
[4:05:42] <+campasino> Playing this on PC or Xbox?
[4:05:42] <fIashman92> Is this the best casr in an rpg?
[4:05:42] <GandhiTheTerrible> Me
[4:05:44] <mattynezz> Yeah, this game is super cool, but a little thin on actual RPG content, like class and equipment selection, and that can be fixed super easy if they just try
[4:05:44] <akitanito> and think about how unhyped you were at first
[4:05:46] <$lotharrio> He was ONE MONTH from retirement.
[4:05:48] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> My 59 year old man is a rockstar
[4:05:49] <TundraOW> Considering this is the first time they tried this, they totally nailed it
[4:05:57] <MasterTonberry23> Make Judgment its own series and keep the beat em up style, and yakuza stays like this going forward
[4:05:57] <mattatatatatatatat> wheres my super detailed yakuza food
[4:06:00] <%Monkeyweed21> stairs
[4:06:02] <%mighty_max_t> It's also refreshing to see an rpg with full on adults instead of teens/early 20s
[4:06:06] <%stabbityrabbit> I think it mostly works because of Ichiban. A new protagonist would make this feel weird.
[4:06:07] <%T_Sasquatch> If this series because this forever im going to just watch the cutscenes on YouTube
[4:06:08] <+Pyr0_Fr0st> This may have started as a test for P6 but just used on Yakuza instead
[4:06:10] <ghostkingwho> yeah anyone who thinks turn-based combat is relic of limited hardware is delusional. it always has rooms for improvements
[4:06:10] <%Monkeyweed21> stairs pat
[4:06:13] <hassanico2> @PatStaresAt Do you think the JRPG format gave them a better way to develop and use assets?
[4:06:14] <%zajoestar> yeah this is a solid start but obviously has places to improve
[4:06:15] <%Hotironclad> Hot Take: I think the real time combat was always the weakest part in the series
[4:06:15] <+That_guy109> That_guy109 subscribed with Prime. 
[4:06:16] <%roscoe_rosaline> His moves are fresh, but not as fresh as their CORPSES
[4:06:19] <theotrainwreck> Toriyama the street thug, two kids, one week from retirement
[4:06:23] <%chiazam> coward
[4:06:28] <+hawaiisam> omg if u made them all breakdancers it would be a dance crew battle lol
[4:06:29] <dinnydanny777> The roads in Japan are so dangerous NotLikeThis
[4:06:33] <%MyNameIsRasus> I also like that this uses lower numbers for combat damage, I always prefer that to the 9999s common in late game FF
[4:06:33] <Saltmeisterr> @T_Sasquatch sure dude :)
[4:06:42] <GandhiTheTerrible> main story PogChamp
[4:06:44] <akitanito> only in yakuza
[4:06:49] <%Too_Much_Nukie> This is just cutscenes.
[4:06:50] <%RadicalWeegee> no stoping , just go!
[4:06:51] <seaechiowai> @commanderclaw I think it's closer to skies of arcadia than chrono trigger
[4:06:55] <%chiazam> Look at all these buff dudes

[4:07:23] <%maskofmichael> And?
[4:07:24] <man_boob> @PatStaresAt have u tried playing Go yet?
[4:07:24] <reonome> saeko looks so weird there
[4:07:24] <dots4eyes> Dressed for work
[4:07:25] <akitanito> not even dressed for work
[4:07:28] <star_feline> I mean, Fedex let us not dress
[4:07:28] <$lotharrio> She's wearing heels.
[4:07:29] <Sulfur_Boride> I'd kinda want Yakuza to be like FF7R where it brings back the beat em up style but you can switch control b/w party members to keep the theme that Ichi usually can't fight tons of people on his own like Kiryu.
[4:07:31] <star_feline> so yea
[4:07:32] <%Hotironclad> Time to play who is the main character

[4:08:00] <+lordericter> wow I wish I could add
[4:08:01] <@commanderclaw> @seaechiowai I mostly meant in the way characters will jostle for position and AOE attacks are dependant on their positions

[4:44:04] <mattynezz> He's only scummy on the outside, but it's a THICK outside.

[4:44:29] <%brachydios777> Maybe... but what if!?
[4:44:30] <Sokumotanaka> "You're not suppose to be in here."
[4:44:36] <+Grayhammatter> does ichiban even have any management business skills?
[4:44:39] <%Jekado> but if Kasuga takes over they will have to change it to Kasuga Confections
[4:44:40] <Oxybe> WE ARE LOSERS WITH GUMPTION AND A HEART OF GOLD! WE CAN DO IT!
[4:44:41] <KaitlynnHere> Stop! You should give your business to the man who doesn’t even know what a safety net is
[4:44:42] <ShichiNoBushi> "I need someone competent to take over the business." *looks over at Ichiban* "No. Not him."

[4:44:49] <CosmicApe13> please do
[4:44:50] <$joylent_blue> WOW, I WONDER WHY THAT IS
[4:44:51] <%MyNameIsRasus> it WAS
[4:44:52] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Nagoshi is friends with real criminals yes.
[4:44:52] <%TheMattman1313> THEY WERE
[4:44:53] <%BoxNavy> hmmm :)
[4:44:54] <akitanito> it was yeah
[4:44:55] <$lotharrio> Sega became big in Japan as a money laundering scheme for Yakuza, right?
[4:44:56] <rcand9> sega love it
[4:44:57] <+Mrbaconator> yeah about that.....
[4:44:57] <%YakumoYomi> Nagoshi is friends with yakuza, right?
[4:44:59] <%Broken_Sonex> I WONDER
[4:45:00] <+preppyposs> WE, 4 RANDOS WILL TAKE CARE OF THIS
[4:45:00] <%medusasghost> is the creator still buddy buddy with yakuza
[4:45:01] <%Dutchpotato> I wonder
[4:45:02] <FlamingoJazz> I really don't think the morals are "unreasonable" but certainly wacky.
[4:45:02] <%superc37> segas kinda in bed with the yakuza
[4:45:02] <%snow_bush> Someone better? How about this ex-con, hobo, traffic cop, and bartender?
[4:45:05] <%rumtumtugnutz> cause Sega isn't owned by the Yakuza at all.
[4:45:06] <%brachydios777> About that
[4:45:06] <fuji_92> IT WAS WRITTEN BY YAKUZA
[4:45:10] <%DedlokPM> @Grayhammatter Did Kiryu back in Yakuza 0?
[4:45:13] <rcand9> mr crime
[4:45:21] <huskarl_zap> heres a spoiler, All japanese video game companies belong to the yakuza.
[4:45:22] <%BoxNavy> you can take one look at nagoshi and tell that yeah he has connections to the family
[4:45:26] <huskarl_zap> its known
[4:45:31] <reonome> nagoshi is basically a yakuza LUL
[4:45:33] <CosmicApe13> actually kinda cool
[4:45:34] <MidnightPacif1c> BUT PAT WHY CANT KIRYU FIGHT WOMEN???????
[4:45:35] <baavetti> Isn't Sega in general run by Yakuza
[4:45:35] <fuji_92> HE DID SO MUCH RESEARCH HE BECAME YAKUZA
[4:45:36] <DashXero> Well, I mean Sega has always been really shady.
[4:45:36] <akitanito> nagoshi dipped a little too deep
[4:45:36] <+vaderxyz1970> Nagoshis an honorary member by now right?
[4:45:36] <+Fusrahdo> They're literally Novellas fellas lmao
[4:45:36] <rcand9> LUL

[4:46:30] <a_mad_dragon> konami are too thick headed and fucking stupid for the yakuza
[4:46:34] <Oxybe> Ichi you're a himbo NOT a businessman.
[4:46:34] <%ClericOfSparda> Ichiban can do it! Have confidence!
[4:46:35] <Gorgs7> Shadow the hedgehog confirmed to be the game personification of the yakuza
[4:46:37] <$lotharrio> Sonic the Hedgehog only has four fingers. Think about where his pinky went.
[4:46:37] <heart_ablaze> Konami might be scumbags, but they're not criminals

[4:51:45] <%Emperor_Machinus> 72 Hour stream
[4:51:45] <%TinyLittleDancer> This is just like the time my dad left to get smokes
[4:51:46] <%Broken_Sonex> THE NUGGET BLOODLINE
[4:51:51] <jcflyguy> Management is easy if you cheat with the DLC managers
[4:51:57] <%Freeborg1997> I'm so glad he decided on a 72 hour stream.
[4:51:58] <%Too_Much_Nukie> I don't know why people are having trouble with management, it's pretty simple.
[4:52:01] <%Grimlockfly> Pat not sleeping, he got a cracker business to run
[4:52:07] <%Monkeyweed21> @GigaSeifer so Omelette is part of a real estate dynasty then
[4:52:14] <CrankyVT> I played the management legit straight through all in the chapter it was unlocked, it was a fun snowball
[4:52:17] <seaechiowai> nugget ascended fowlhood
[4:52:18] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Balancing assets is tough but it's not hard to understand what's happening.
[4:52:22] <Gorgs7> @GigaSeifer if any game could have an inexplicable immortal business running chicken, it would be yakuza
[4:52:23] <PageofHeart> Unlimited Business Time Stream
[4:52:28] <CrankyVT> Kinda forgot there was dlc managers
[4:52:32] <%roscoe_rosaline> Pat is actually traveling to Japan and get a job in management and vlogging the whole thing?!?! HYPE
[4:52:33] <$lotharrio> I missed out on some fairly straightforward parts of Management early on. Once you understand it, it's pretty simple.
[4:52:38] <+Fusrahdo> S T O N K S
[4:52:43] <%DianaTheAscian> it's crazy how much energy Pat has for the Yakuza streams

[4:53:04] <%pipboy344> Damn keyboard
[4:53:07] <huskarl_zap> The management is only hard in the beginning then it just prints money
[4:53:07] <jcflyguy> I played legit for awhile but got annoyed with how long it was taking so I said "screw it" and just cheated
[4:53:18] <CrankyVT> The only thing that sucks is you can't embezzle your company's money lmao
[4:53:19] <%brachydios777> it’s free real estate
[4:53:36] <+Fusrahdo> Just make more money then you use 4Head
[4:53:39] <jcflyguy> Yeah but at the end you get 2 or 3 mil per shareholder meeting
[4:53:44] <+taltalheights> You would sleep, but then alarm cock showed up

[4:54:02] <jcflyguy> Did you shit your pants?!
[4:54:02] <$StrawberryPantsu> Save?
[4:54:04] <madtrixr> when you are at the very top a session nets you 3m

[5:03:52] <redrins> put chicken in the 3rd slot
[5:03:54] <+krispen_wa> YEYEYEYEYEYEYEYE
[5:03:55] <UlriktheSlayer1> @T_Sasquatch damn
[5:03:56] <fIashman92> Third slot
[5:03:56] <Blank9> they only apply to the skill of that slot
[5:03:57] <%Ner234> SourPls
[5:03:57] <%Hotironclad> third slot
[5:03:58] <%Jekado> Leader does ALL STATS
[5:03:58] <CrankyVT> For members only one stat applies
[5:03:59] <+Joorai> 3rd slot!
[5:03:59] <rbakervv> wrong slot
[5:04:00] <$StrawberryPantsu> Look at the bars
[5:04:00] <%coreyyotto> second and third employees only contribute one stat
[5:04:00] <huskarl_zap> put the cock int the last slot
[5:04:01] <%brachydios777> Yeyeyeye
[5:04:01] <$lotharrio> Chicken goes in 3rd slot
[5:04:01] <+DeltascapeV4> Check teh stats
[5:04:01] <GigaSeifer> Because you made him member instead of Leader
[5:04:02] <%Jekado> Members only do one stat
[5:04:02] <%RAAAAAINMAKER> Nugget Jr
[5:04:03] <%charp35> switch the slot
[5:04:04] <hassanico2> @PatStaresAt Omelette is actually one of the best
[5:04:04] <fuji_92> OMELETTE LEADER
[5:04:05] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Pat they only use 1 ability for the designated slot.
[5:04:05] <CrankyVT> Only leaders have all their stats apply
[5:04:06] <%sirisvirus> omellette in the 5rd slot
[5:04:06] <Onamar> Look at the icon above each employee
[5:04:06] <+Link232> So basically Leader has all stats available, and the two other staff members only have 1 of their stats influencing the store
[5:04:06] <$lotharrio> See the highlighted symbols?
[5:04:06] <%Mr_Pylon> Omellete best at ribbon?
[5:04:07] <+zanzibar_junker> put him on the third slot
[5:04:07] <Zebroneath> you need more love
[5:04:08] <CrankyVT> pay attention to the bars
[5:04:08] <mattynezz> Position matters
[5:04:08] <+Grizwaldus> omelette 3 space @PatStaresAt

[5:04:09] <TundraOW> Look at the member icon
[5:04:09] <%coreyyotto> look at highlighted bar
[5:04:09] <+Solutha> Wrong slot pat
[5:04:10] <%Broken_Sonex> GET THAT COCK
[5:04:10] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Look at the screen.
[5:04:14] <%MyNameIsRasus> Look above
[5:04:14] <Blank9> the ones that are lit up
[5:04:15] <%Deano8817> look what the slots do
[5:04:15] <alephalpha> make omelette the leader
[5:04:15] <madtrixr> the 2 slots only affect one stat
[5:04:15] <huskarl_zap> read the stat bars on the slots
[5:04:16] <%Nekros4442> Look at the highlighted part s of the slots to the left
[5:04:17] <%heartlesshealer> WRONG SLOT
[5:04:17] <@SoFarFetched> because you got leaders and members
[5:04:17] <redrins> the second and third employee slot has fixed stats on one of those three
[5:04:17] <fIashman92> Slot determmiines which stats get usesed
[5:04:17] <Apolake> here we go
[5:04:18] <%VHGS> look below the portraits
[5:04:18] <%Jekado> LEADER USES ALL STATS
[5:04:19] <%Mordexai0> she's Jane from saints row
[5:04:19] <%heartlesshealer> LABELS
[5:04:19] <wrydiculous> cuz take a look at the available bars
[5:04:19] <GigaSeifer> different slots take different skills, only leader uses all three
[5:04:20] <%charp35> leader effects all the other 2 only effect 1
[5:04:20] <madtrixr> leader affects all 3
[5:04:20] <+TDAWS_MP132> pat look at the symbols
[5:04:21] <+Fusrahdo> Screen
[5:04:21] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Only the highlited ones under the portrait are used.
[5:04:22] <TundraOW> Leader applies all 3 stats, the members only apply the stat from the icon
[5:04:22] <$lotharrio> In the card slots, there are some symbols highlighted.
[5:04:22] <KazMkII> make all 3 bars blue
[5:04:23] <redrins> thr first one has all three
[5:04:23] <+Solutha> Look at the bars
[5:04:23] <%Too_Much_Nukie> For that slot.
[5:04:24] <%soflicar> certain slots only have 1 field
[5:04:26] <%koolaid_kevster> the dull ones are inactive you cant use them
[5:04:27] <fuji_92> only leader ups all stats
[5:04:27] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> the ones lit up that matter pat
[5:04:28] <xbb1024> get rid of the guy
[5:04:29] <%Hotironclad> leader does all three and the other two does just one @PatStaresAt
[5:04:29] <$lotharrio> Under the selection.
[5:04:31] <%BigCoffee> all 3 bars blue
[5:04:31] <%JustToWatch> IT BEGINS
[5:04:31] <CrankyVT> @PatStaresAt Each member has only certain stats that add to the gauge.
[5:04:31] <+alzeizt> the slots only take a specific stats
[5:04:33] <mattynezz> Each slot only provides the non-greyed out stats to the buisness
[5:04:35] <+Grizwaldus> stat bars important
[5:04:36] <%MyNameIsRasus> Make all 3 bars blue
[5:04:36] <%heartlesshealer> ............................
[5:04:36] <%promessav2> no going in the red, so add more heart
[5:04:36] <CrankyVT> Yeah
[5:04:37] <ovan20> @PatStaresAt each slot contribute with 1 atribute, except the manager that does it all 3
[5:04:40] <%honeyman18> put the three bars above the red basically
[5:04:41] <%RAAAAAINMAKER> Has the chicken always been in charge?
[5:04:42] <sirrice77> @PatStaresAt if the bar is greyed out it isnt used in that slot so the stat on the person is useless
[5:04:42] <CrankyVT> Leader is the only slot that lets all 3 apply
[5:04:43] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Replace the leader with the old lady.
[5:04:44] <%Broken_Sonex> "BUT I CAN.....I DON'T KNOW WHA....."
[5:04:44] <Monkey_D_Judd> granny as leader, lady in slot 2, omelette in slot 3. fire the 2 dudes.
[5:04:46] <%DedlokPM> @PatStaresAt see how 1st slot has 3 meters and slot 2 and 3 have 2 greyed out slots?
[5:04:46] <%koolaid_kevster> old lady
[5:04:48] <%Jekado> if you look under you can see that the 2nd slot is the top stat while the 3rd is bottom
[5:04:50] <fuji_92> leader has 3
[5:04:54] <valriot> WAIT ISNT THAT CHICKEN 40 YEARS OLD
[5:04:55] <a_mad_dragon> GRANY IN THE MIDDLE
[5:04:57] <$lotharrio> Leader uses all 3 service stats. Members only use one.
[5:05:02] <%weissguard> Nice.
[5:05:02] <%Grimlockfly> Awwww ye mind goblin time
[5:05:03] <TundraOW> Optimal PogU
[5:05:06] <%heartlesshealer> yes
[5:05:06] <%coreyyotto> Leader contributes all stats, other two employees only contribute one fixed stat that varies per business
[5:05:07] <$StrawberryPantsu> Fire everyone who's not staffed
[5:05:07] <%heartlesshealer> do this
[5:05:08] <seaechiowai> VoHiYo

[5:06:07] <highfivesquash> not a word pat
[5:06:08] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You also can't fire the chicken.
[5:06:10] <whimsicallifestyle> MUST have chicken
[5:06:11] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Even if you want to.
[5:06:13] <DashXero> Replaced by a chicken.
[5:06:14] <%maskofmichael> You cant fire a chicken
[5:06:15] <%miguelrod777> she does good work
[5:06:15] <%promessav2> imagine getting fired while a chicken does the work
[5:06:17] <jcflyguy> Omelette is OP
[5:06:18] <@SoFarFetched> TO DEFEAT.....THE HUNS
[5:06:18] <%roscoe_rosaline> He was one week from retirement ;_;
[5:06:18] <+Solutha> A fucking chicken is better than those 2
[5:06:19] <%Emperor_Machinus> Chicken is more important that Old man
[5:06:21] <%Jekado> You can't fire the chicken or the grandma... not that would want to fire the chicken
[5:06:22] <Blank9> upgrade a lot
[5:06:24] <wrydiculous> A chicken did a better job than you
[5:06:25] <%Hotironclad> chicken is actually the best bronze member LUL
[5:06:26] <muetank> Imagine getting shit canned and replaced by a chicken.
[5:06:27] <%RAAAAAINMAKER> Chicken Union up your ass
[5:06:30] <CrankyVT> @PatStaresAt I can give tips after the tutorial but Omelette is straight up your MVP for a good while
[5:06:30] <%sirisvirus> Omelette is aweme for notabality
[5:06:32] <GigaSeifer> @PatStaresAt fully upgraded Ichiban Confections can be solo'd by fully upgraded chicken
[5:06:36] <ovan20> @hassanico2 i made it director and i'm paying 600K yen to it LUL
[5:06:38] <%honeyman18> service then volume\
[5:06:38] <+preppyposs> BETTER SERVICE
[5:06:39] <%Jekado> volume is the only way to increase profit
[5:06:39] <Wolfstriker121> Chicken will be ceo
[5:06:40] <valriot> @Emperor_Machinus Yeah but Nugget Jr wouldve been born in like 1980s
[5:06:42] <$lotharrio> Upgrade, then Service.
[5:06:44] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt Sales volume makes the business make more money, but raises the required stats.
[5:06:45] <%Jekado> do one of each
[5:06:45] <redrins> sales volume increases the money you get but it requires higher stats
[5:06:45] <%whyskeywolfe> I cant even imagine a sales team without a chicken on it.
[5:06:46] <mor3gan> YOO is that Nugget?
[5:06:47] <%BigCoffee> service
[5:06:49] <Apolake> chicken is the best

[5:06:54] <@SoFarFetched> Nugget JUNIOR
[5:06:56] <KazMkII> Get option 1 then option 3
[5:07:00] <Blank9> NO UPGRADE
[5:07:01] <+Link232> No upgrade
[5:07:04] <%Jekado> no do upgrade because you get more profit
[5:07:05] <Blank9> you have so much money

[5:07:06] <huskarl_zap> COCK DONT QUIT

[5:08:34] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt If you hover over sales volume, you can see what the new requirements will be. I recommend doing that and upgrading the other areas to reach the requirements. That way you avoid disappointing customers and losing money.

[5:14:10] <ovan20> the bank was in the back Keepo

[5:15:07] <ammobasket> oh famously
[5:15:07] <%Chatterbox1991> always have too
[5:15:07] <@SoFarFetched> @that_aint_a_wolf just look at Pat's schedule. It's tomorrow.
[5:15:07] <+NotaryRotary> D:
[5:15:08] <%Nekros4442> China and Japan might have the worst relationship in Asia
[5:15:10] <ovan20> JAPAN LOVES CHINA Kappa
[5:15:13] <%AtlasMcCoy> I'm 90% sure it's just a crime to counterfeit ANY currency whatsoever
[5:15:14] <%Psyramics> if they had an extradition treaty they would care, but uh... guessing they don't
[5:15:16] <%rumtumtugnutz> counterfeiting money is an international crime
[5:15:16] <CrankyVT> that door in the back is really big
[5:15:17] <RushUnplugged> "suck my dick China" "no YOU suck my dick Japan"
[5:15:18] <GandhiTheTerrible> lmao
[5:15:19] <%za7az> Whaaaaaaa- nooooo LUL
[5:15:20] <%Piemono> They can only have so many serial numbers though
[5:15:21] <%Pigg1yJuffs> Like China and anywhere get along great.
[5:15:21] <+preppyposs> it is kind of a dumb fucking plan isn't it
[5:15:21] <%heartlesshealer> China hates everything they can't control
[5:15:23] <%XeroSigmaPrime> LOL China cant even get along with Hong Kong one guy XD
[5:15:26] <%Jekado> Could this counterfeit stuff be tied to Ichiban not like he has counterfeit money on him too... psaSmug
[5:15:30] <%shiplord13> Japanese government: They producing Chinese Money and then sending it to China... That sounds like a Chinese problem not Japanese problem.
[5:15:32] <+that_aint_a_wolf> Japanese companies love cheap chinese labor, great relations
[5:15:33] <%Piemono> sooner or later someone is gonna get pissed
[5:15:34] <Gorgs7> @arancet with their international relations, it's more likely that japan and china are actively forging each other's currency
[5:15:37] <%brachydios777> Japan has fucked China alot
[5:15:38] <GigaSeifer> well, you gotta pay for printer ink
[5:15:38] <%promessav2> japan loves chinese stuff that emulates japanese stuff
[5:15:39] <$joylent_blue> but why would anyone do that?! it's illegal!
[5:15:41] <$lotharrio> Well, the paper and ink probably cost something
[5:15:48] <mattynezz> This is being done WITH the Japanese Government, so they don't mind.
[5:15:48] <%rumtumtugnutz> Being a canadian, if I made fake Azerbaijani money it would still be a felony
[5:15:50] <a_mad_dragon> the cost of the paper and the ink though
[5:15:51] <%Too_Much_Nukie> It's a big crime to counterfeit any money but the likelihood of the corrupt cops caring about fake Yuan is a lot lower than fake Yen.
[5:15:57] <+krispen_wa> To be fair, if China is to hate anyone...Japan probably is one of the most deserving
[5:16:03] <GigaSeifer> they're importing the paper and paying with counterfeit, so yeah the costs are zero
[5:16:04] <%BoxNavy> its a good hustle. we should do something like this.
[5:16:07] <%ClericOfSparda> @shiplord13 That killed me. fucking true.
[5:16:08] <%shiplord13> Literally a big problem for China
[5:16:09] <$lotharrio> That's bold.. provocative.
[5:16:09] <+Solutha> implying they dont pay in fake cash to their chinese workers
[5:16:10] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Hey China loves the UN and WHO, they just suck China's dick constantly XD
[5:16:11] <GigaSeifer> they're only paying for labour
[5:16:12] <+preppyposs> LAUNDRY THAT MONEY
[5:16:20] <%brachydios777> Especially with WW2
[5:16:21] <%Jasek7> the existence of counterfeitied Yuan means the existence of a counterfeiting machine leaving the oppurtunity for fake Yen
[5:16:27] <RushUnplugged> yes it's still a crime. But are they gonna persecute it as hard as someone counterfeiting national currency? no way
[5:16:31] <%promessav2> it's hard to get mad about counterfeit yuan when China fakes the value anyway. goteem
[5:16:33] <GigaSeifer> it's a great idea
[5:16:37] <%MyNameIsRasus> It's a good hustle
[5:16:37] <%penitentpendant> Oh hey, the predictions we made an hour ago came out
[5:16:37] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @Jasek7 It really doesn't.
[5:16:37] <%roscoe_rosaline> Put that money RIGHT in the washing machine
[5:16:41] <+preppyposs> that is true
[5:16:44] <DashXero> Yeah. You don't wanna fuck with the Chinese mob.
[5:16:46] <$lotharrio> Yeah, I mean how long can this really last, right?
[5:16:46] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Yen is much more complicated to print.
[5:16:49] <Gorgs7> I mean, the chinese and the japanese have been fucking with each other for thousands of years, it's kinda long-standing
[5:16:52] <%Mr_Pylon> As long as they don't screw over a mainland triad
[5:16:52] <%Broken_Sonex> @BoxNavy Who's to say we aren't already
[5:16:58] <%TheMattman1313> As long as none of the Triads based in China send a calling card
[5:17:01] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You need a MUCH more complicated setup to print yen.
[5:17:05] <%BoxNavy> only do it once or twice :)
[5:17:12] <redrins> have guys in the mainland to warn you when they catch wind of your bullshit then close up shop before they arrive
[5:17:13] <%ClericOfSparda> Ichiban would know about how criminals work
[5:17:17] <MasterTonberry23> I assume the plan is to close up shop and move out if the mainland chinese come sniffing
[5:17:22] <%shiplord13> Yep
[5:17:25] <televisedrevolting> I know one ingredient of Yen, but so does everyone else. The rest of the recipe is secret.
[5:17:25] <%Too_Much_Nukie> No he's not.
[5:17:28] <%doomunderthestairs> he does have one
[5:17:29] <%coreyyotto> he's carrying a japanese dollar
[5:17:29] <%shiplord13> Just a bit covered in blood
[5:17:30] <tsuchi7> its a Yen tho
[5:17:30] <%Too_Much_Nukie> He's carrying yen.
[5:17:30] <%Nekros4442> Ichiban had a Yen bill not Yuan
[5:17:31] <%Mr_Pylon> but that one is fake Yen
[5:17:31] <$lotharrio> Well that was a yen, though
[5:17:31] <GigaSeifer> @patstaresat no, he's carrying an unfinished Yen
[5:17:31] <%furiousfurioso> the bill he has is Yen
[5:17:32] <melonsouda> Isnt ichiban's bill a Yen bill though?

[5:37:07] <%bevyrage> @ALazo egg on rice is like one of the hardiest meals you can have. it's a much more palatable version of drinking a cup of raw eggs
[5:37:09] <%fritz_dacat> he loves tender meat
[5:37:10] <huskarl_zap> cast iron kill

[5:37:58] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Wait, why is it safe to eat raw eggs in Japan, dont they have Salmonella too?
[5:37:58] <gooner4654> I'm surprised they dont have insurance fraud mini game like saints row
[5:38:03] <JaceDarkstar> breaker is great
[5:38:05] <Oxybe> oddly enough i find raw eggs more palatable than cooked ones. cooked egg whites have a texture i just don't care for
[5:38:10] <@SoFarFetched> @XeroSigmaPrime conditions in japan are a lot more humane than in the US
[5:38:25] <KaitlynnHere> @gooner4654 too much physics
[5:38:33] <+starzo0> @XeroSigmaPrime its depends on the source
[5:38:34] <%BoxNavy> ugh yeah egg whites make me nauseous
[5:38:42] <%Jekado> If you live in America and you want to use raw eggs just pasteurize them. The bacteria is on the outside of the egg.
[5:38:59] <%Jekado> but yeah Japanese eggs are much safer then in America
[5:39:08] <%superc37> eggs in general are disgusting tbh
[5:39:20] <+preppyposs> OH JESUS
[5:39:27] <akitanito> That's why you should crack the egg on a flat surface to avoid possible contamination
[5:39:28] <%Capta1n_H3nry> HE LICK
[5:39:30] <uncle_speeps> you're disgusting
[5:39:39] <%Jekado> Raw egg with natto and rice is really good
[5:39:44] <Oxybe> nah. a melty egg yolk is great.
[5:39:51] <%superc37> ur moms disgusting
[5:39:53] <$lotharrio> He lick. He sit. Mostly he lick.
[5:39:53] <%Breaknoon> egg haters

[5:39:59] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @SoFarFetched OH so chickens tend to be less sick and less likely to pass it into the gg, I get you. Thanks :D
[5:40:07] <%Jekado> also if you want something really good look up how to make onsen eggs
[5:40:09] <%BoxNavy> hey fried egg is delicious
[5:40:15] <dinnydanny777> The US has really bad food standards, salmonella is something like 5x as common as it is in Europe
[5:40:17] <%logoth_> head to the rose bottom
[5:40:21] <ahaegotrigger> rose blossom LUL
[5:40:22] <+starzo0> ive got a few chikens and a duck, i givem a good rinse before i chuck em in the fridge
[5:40:23] <+preppyposs> He smells the food on you
[5:40:26] <$lotharrio> It's cause you're so salty, Pat.

[5:40:46] <%NatK94> Not gonna go back to Ichiban Confections?
[5:40:46] <%brachydios777> @dinnydanny777 God my country is fucked up
[5:40:51] <%trustycoyote> "I've covered wars, ya know?!"
[5:40:52] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @Jekado Salmonella is usually always inside the egg according to Healthline and Wiki
[5:40:55] <%BoxNavy> lets all go eat pats arm
[5:40:56] <akitanito> Japan also doesn't have to deal with such a huge meat demand, comparatively
[5:40:57] <+Grayhammatter> he lick

[5:42:10] <dinnydanny777> @brachydios777 There seems to be a massive lobby for keeping food standards as low as possible as well so it won't get better anytime soon sadly
[5:42:13] <mattynezz> He's trying to find your titty, but the damn thing doesn't want to be found, and that's very rude of you to hide it

[5:52:48] <wrydiculous> Dragons Den that shit
[5:52:49] <Blank9> shareholder is pokemon starters, hire anyone with a red icon in the upper left to fill the gap
[5:52:50] <dan_g_v> give them all the bjs

[5:53:48] <+dante_must_die_exe> Omelette does big persuasion
[5:53:55] <ulcaban> She poses like that gamedev
[5:53:55] <GigaSeifer> a bum
[5:53:58] <mattatatatatatatat> now if you look at this graph you will see our sales are eggcelent
[5:54:00] <huskarl_zap> HIGH GUY
[5:54:01] <dan_g_v> he's a master
[5:54:01] <%BoxNavy> jermaOld
[5:54:02] <fIashman92> Tenacity is HP, Charisma is Attack
[5:54:03] <%zajoestar> for shareholder meetings charisma is the ony stat you should worry about
[5:54:05] <Blank9> oh shit he's red, that's perfect
[5:54:06] <madtrixr> oh did you not get the management dlc?
[5:54:08] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Yes
[5:54:10] <akitanito> yes
[5:54:10] <%Solipsist_Construct> youll want the baseball player
[5:54:11] <Oxybe> "Bukkok!" "I'll take 10!"
[5:54:12] <NitronStreams> "why arent you making infinite money forever? you call yourselves a business?"
[5:54:16] <Lionkevinson> Damn he’s hot
[5:54:19] <MasterTonberry23> does the color of their portrait reflect how good they are? like bronze and silver tier?
[5:54:22] <xwiishirex> That one guy is older than the dirt we'll sleep in.
[5:54:25] <huskarl_zap> is the dlc not unlocked?
[5:54:25] <MidnightPacif1c> SourPls
[5:54:26] <JaceDarkstar> so were bringing omelet obviously
[5:54:27] <Monkey_D_Judd> didn't you get all of the super cheat dlc for this?
[5:54:28] <akitanito> yeah
[5:54:31] <+preppyposs> PUBBY
[5:54:32] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Command cost also matters for shareholder.
[5:54:33] <TundraOW> When does the exploitation start?
[5:54:36] <%miguelrod777> I'm being attacked by this employee
[5:54:37] <%maenos2> this music slaps
[5:54:38] <%AtlasMcCoy> You got something against homeless men?
[5:54:42] <+krispen_wa> "Without any dreams or passions of his own, this youth is just living life by the numbers" - Hey it's me!
[5:54:42] <madtrixr> they have gacha rarities
[5:54:43] <%rumtumtugnutz> Wow. Baseball dude has big charisma.
[5:54:44] <%AzureGale> Gief was not sated by Pat's arm
[5:54:44] <MasterTonberry23> SUPER SERIOUS BUSINESS MUSIC
[5:54:46] <$lotharrio> You already have the best "Normal" ranked hires. Hanayama is a solid high tier "Rare" ranked hire. He's also great in share holder meetings.
[5:54:47] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Omelette is great when trained up at shareholder meetings because her attacks only cost 5.
[5:54:48] <%fritz_dacat> oh that dawg of mines
[5:54:52] <+zanzibar_junker> Pay attention to the left coenee
[5:54:59] <+JonathLP> the real yakuza begins here
[5:55:00] <Oxybe> Aw man our Basebro is only R? I was hoping he was SR or SSR
[5:55:01] <$lotharrio> Yes
[5:55:01] <extradopeness> These results have never been seen before
[5:55:03] <TundraOW> He didn't get the cheater DLC
[5:55:04] <%Dova573> I have the homeless guy doing nothing and racking up surplus pay, but I cant make myself to fire him
[5:55:04] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Hire him you fool.
[5:55:04] <melonsouda> Damn he charismatic as fuck
[5:55:06] <$lotharrio> Baseball is strong
[5:55:07] <%StebTheVee> StebTheVee subscribed at Tier 1. 
[5:55:07] <%Too_Much_Nukie> He is.
[5:55:09] <akitanito> at least get silvers
[5:55:10] <Lionkevinson> Of course he has charisma. He’s a baseball dude
[5:55:14] <Blank9> he's very good
[5:55:15] <%coreyyotto> he puts in work
[5:55:16] <%Jekado> he's expensive though
[5:55:17] <NeroInfinite> Hanyama is great
[5:55:21] <%Jekado> but yeah you need him for the red
[5:55:23] <fIashman92> DONT BUY PROPERTY
[5:55:24] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Pat DID get the cheater DLC, it triggers after the shareholder meeting.
[5:55:25] <madtrixr> i would imagine so, considering hes a rare and the others are normal
[5:55:31] <Blank9> upgrade everything equally
[5:55:34] <a_mad_dragon> NO PROPERTY
[5:55:35] <xwiishirex> Hanayama clutch, confirmed.
[5:55:37] <%StebTheVee> hi
[5:55:43] <dots4eyes> The life of baseball has taught him many things about your business venture
[5:55:44] <+zanzibar_junker> Increase sales volume later
[5:55:47] <+omenoffate> I’ve used him the entire time as red he’s solid
[5:55:48] <%Jekado> @Too_Much_Nukie honestly they are a bit expensive early on
[5:55:49] <jcflyguy> Upgrade starting business first
[5:55:50] <xwiishirex> Rotate your saves.
[5:55:50] <tsuchi7> upgraaaade
[5:55:52] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt Upgrade your shop before buying a new one.
[5:55:56] <+Tadashi047> upgrade everything
[5:55:58] <Blank9> yes
[5:56:00] <$lotharrio> That's how you do it, Pat!
[5:56:01] <fIashman92> yES, THAT IS SMART
[5:56:01] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Yes.
[5:56:02] <madtrixr> yeah thats fine
[5:56:03] <%seraphimjordan> you want to upgrade
[5:56:03] <%Dova573> yep
[5:56:04] <%rumtumtugnutz> you have to spend money
[5:56:04] <huskarl_zap> volume comes last
[5:56:05] <+preppyposs> yea
[5:56:06] <NeroInfinite> yes
[5:56:06] <GigaSeifer> correct
[5:56:07] <madtrixr> thats the way to do it
[5:56:09] <jcflyguy> Good idea
[5:56:10] <%Kitafin> ye
[5:56:14] <+zanzibar_junker> do that when you have better staff
[5:56:14] <Blank9> upgrade until you have around 1.5 million left
[5:56:15] <%seraphimjordan> yes
[5:56:18] <%Jekado> i think you can upgrade a another tier
[5:56:20] <%Too_Much_Nukie> And now your income is over 100k more.
[5:56:21] <madtrixr> so you dont have a deficient stat and get fucked in buisness time
[5:56:21] <%BoxNavy> ok :)
[5:56:23] <+krispen_wa> BIG BRAIN
[5:56:24] <%Too_Much_Nukie> This is how mafia work.
[5:56:26] <fIashman92> Keep going
[5:56:27] <star_feline> stonks
[5:56:30] <jcflyguy> Perfect!
[5:56:31] <%Jekado> you want the confections to be outputting a bunch
[5:56:39] <xwiishirex> Do it in the way that satisfies the goblins, Pat!
[5:56:42] <fIashman92> Hes go it
[5:56:43] <+Grayhammatter> oh shit, we getting stonks?
[5:56:44] <+zanzibar_junker> atop
[5:56:44] <mattynezz> It's a Tier system , just like the Cabaret in 0, with shitty Bronze employees (with a couple exceptions), decent Silver employees, and great Gold employees
[5:56:46] <Blank9> also, you can assign hanayama to the shop
[5:56:49] <+zanzibar_junker> stop
[5:56:54] <%FoolsArcade> careful
[5:56:54] <sponsoredviewer910> you should do it after shareholder meeting to lower spendings
[5:56:54] <%roscoe_rosaline> GO HOME AND BE A SALARY MAN!
[5:56:57] <%Monkeyweed21> Save money for other businesses
[5:56:58] <%FoolsArcade> mangement funds are low
[5:57:05] <xwiishirex> Become 100!
[5:57:06] <%JaydenSai> @PatStaresAt Now assign Hanayama
[5:57:06] <empiricism> why you got a chicken
[5:57:07] <CrankyVT> one last sales volume upgrade
[5:57:08] <%coreyyotto> you shoulda just gone straight into the meeting
[5:57:09] <mattynezz> You need money to buy more shops
[5:57:10] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> you should've waited to do this after the meeting
[5:57:12] <dots4eyes> Animals as leaders
[5:57:15] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Upgrade sales again.
[5:57:16] <Blank9> he might be better than old lady for the leader
[5:57:25] <CrankyVT> you invested the stats to it, its worthless unless you up the volume to match it
[5:57:25] <fIashman92> Omelette is actually one of the best characters
[5:57:25] <%Jekado> you might want to fire the old lady when you have the chance
[5:57:26] <+preppyposs> PAT WAIT
[5:57:27] <$lotharrio> DO IT
[5:57:27] <%Too_Much_Nukie> IKUZO!
[5:57:29] <tsuchi7> doeet

[5:57:32] <JaceDarkstar> omelet better be T the meeting
[5:57:41] <akitanito> HOLD UP
[5:57:44] <+preppyposs> BIG DO IT
[5:57:45] <huskarl_zap> COCK DONT QUIT
[5:57:46] <%BoxNavy> YEAH
[5:57:47] <$lotharrio> But now you don't have much heart.
[5:57:50] <Blank9> works
[5:57:52] <NeroInfinite> There ya go
[5:57:54] <%Jekado> omelet is pretty strong
[5:57:55] <+alzeizt> also pat theres a bonhs if you put an employee with their preffered workplace
[5:57:59] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You can't fire the old lady.
[5:58:02] <xwiishirex> ALL OR NOTHING, PANSIES! LET'S GO!!! DarkMode LUL DarkMode
[5:58:02] <%FoolsArcade> don't!
[5:58:04] <%FoolsArcade> oh boy
[5:58:06] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You can't fire grandma or omelette.

[5:58:16] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> oof
[5:58:16] <%BoxNavy> heart at risk monkaS
[5:58:19] <%Too_Much_Nukie> But they're both much much better than the average bronze person.
[5:58:22] <Blank9> remember
[5:58:23] <%hahaha1171> oh no
[5:58:24] <NeroInfinite> 201k yen**
[5:58:24] <Blank9> pokemon
[5:58:27] <%Jekado> @Too_Much_Nukie the other old lady
[5:58:28] <+krispen_wa> PLACE YOUR BETS
[5:58:29] <fIashman92> Pokemon element rps
[5:58:32] <%promessav2> let's kill them
[5:58:32] <Blank9> red > green > blue > red
[5:58:33] <CrankyVT> The first shareholder meeting's going to be a doozy, but you should bounce back after it
[5:58:34] <xwiishirex> ALL or nothing
[5:58:34] <$lotharrio> Hanayama is just gonna beat the shit out of all your shareholders until they love him.
[5:58:36] <%coreyyotto> this gonna be good
[5:58:36] <jcflyguy> Fire Emblem weapon triangle time!
[5:58:37] <%Taisuru> Damn, 6 hours? You actually worked longer than me today :V
[5:58:38] <%HitchhikingThrough> Oh christ
[5:58:39] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Oh yeah that one should be fired.
[5:58:40] <KingVantq> prepare for tiny goblins
[5:58:40] <uncle_speeps> i love how omlette can be on the board
[5:58:41] <Maleicus> pats going to be destroyed
[5:58:43] <%logoth_> USE SKILL??/
[5:58:44] <%BoxNavy> monkaS WHAT
[5:58:45] <MasterTonberry23> Oh this is gonna be good
[5:58:46] <CrankyVT> It's just rock paper scissors with an energy meter like Teppen
[5:58:48] <%HitchhikingThrough> I just joined what is happening
[5:58:48] <TundraOW> It's rock pape scissors but with capitalism
[5:58:49] <+Gespens> its fucking Danganronpa
[5:58:50] <KingVantq> it's just pokemon
[5:58:50] <Louie_Salmon> Did it just load so fast it cut off his dialogue
[5:58:54] <%Jekado> i told him that i have a guide
[5:58:54] <%AzureGale> Shareholder meetings: SERIOUS FUCKING BUSINESS
[5:58:59] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> i recommend to just brute force this
[5:59:01] <xwiishirex> Satisfy the Beast!
[5:59:02] <%BoxNavy> 1/8 monkaS
[5:59:02] <dan_g_v> use aoe right from the beginning
[5:59:03] <%Jekado> it is basically over complicated RPS
[5:59:05] <%rumtumtugnutz> BKAWK
[5:59:06] <xwiishirex> Become 100!
[5:59:07] <%roscoe_rosaline> SUPLEX THE SHAREHOLDERS
[5:59:08] <uncle_speeps> REAL TIME Q&A BATTLE
[5:59:09] <dots4eyes> Finally, I'm going to learn what really happens at a shareholder meeting.
[5:59:09] <%penitentpendant> 8 pages of tutorials
[5:59:09] <%coreyyotto> straight up, if you fail, reload the save
[5:59:13] <%LaughingCatt> oh f*** business simulator
[5:59:16] <%promessav2> time for a nonstop debate
[5:59:18] <mattynezz> Make Cellphone Games!!!!!
[5:59:22] <dan_g_v> use commamd grabs
[5:59:23] <+zanzibar_junker> r>g>b
[5:59:24] <%HitchhikingThrough> Essence of Business?
[5:59:27] <xwiishirex> Noses: brown
[5:59:29] <%Too_Much_Nukie> It's real simple when you remember the pokemon type chart.
[5:59:39] <+CourageTheCat> Business style!!!
[5:59:39] <+omenoffate> The tutorial over complicated it lol
[5:59:42] <%Jekado> thats what i used
[5:59:42] <CrankyVT> This is actually stupid easy to do. You RPS the color of their complaint, and then you RPS the element they are. Lv.2 Sorry to regain energy and buy time if you got meter for it
[5:59:43] <madtrixr> its not even a type chart
[5:59:45] <%Jekado> pokemon chart
[5:59:50] <madtrixr> its a weapon triangle
[5:59:51] <KaitlynnHere> You need an employee whip.
[5:59:56] <dan_g_v> save the master ball for later
[5:59:57] <jcflyguy> It's *really* easy once you get used to it.
[5:59:59] <%BoxNavy> moon2W
[6:00:00] <+krispen_wa> DEAL DAMAGE TO SHAREHOLDERS
[6:00:00] <+CourageTheCat> LVL 2 SORRY LMAOOO
[6:00:02] <Blank9> the timing is like cabaret clubs
[6:00:12] <xwiishirex> Candy Crush, Clash of Clans and Call of Duty or bust!
[6:00:14] <madtrixr> its really not as hard as it sounds
[6:00:16] <dan_g_v> we go 5 minutes reading rules
[6:00:16] <CrankyVT> I'm not even joking, you have levels to your apologies
[6:00:17] <+CourageTheCat> DEAL DAMAGE TO YOUR SHAREHOLDERS
[6:00:24] <+CourageTheCat> DANGANRONPA TIME
[6:00:24] <TheNewJapanGuy> Vince McMahon is like Lv99 at this game
[6:00:26] <%roscoe_rosaline> READ. WITH. MORE PERIOD. FOR. EMPHASIS.
[6:00:30] <xwiishirex> The Three C's of Gaming!
[6:00:30] <madtrixr> yeah, the level 3 is incredible
[6:00:32] <%seraphimjordan> sales volume increases potential profit and the other three increase the values of the three stats making the margins easier to manage with employee stats
[6:00:33] <+zanzibar_junker> THIS TOOK AN AFTERNOON TO HIT #1 AND 18 MILLION
[6:00:39] <%Jekado> wow you just have to be above 50 thats generous
[6:00:48] <Louie_Salmon> This sounds so much more complicated than it is
[6:00:51] <%penitentpendant> Objection! Intensifies.
[6:00:53] <fIashman92> Page 7 is very important
[6:00:55] <+JohnMarkley> Crush the shareholders spirit! Choke the rivers with their dead johnma1BLAM
[6:00:55] <Louie_Salmon> It's really very straightforward
[6:00:55] <madtrixr> NOPWE
[6:00:57] <$lotharrio> They'll say a thing that will have a color. Match that color with an employee until they stop talking. Then look left and select the right color again. Each time you yell at share holders, it takes meter. Meter builds up over time or by apologizing. Apologize with Y.
[6:00:58] <%Too_Much_Nukie> IT'S NOT
[6:00:59] <madtrixr> ITS REAL SIMPLE
[6:01:00] <%AzureGale> ATTACK THEIR LIFE POINTS DIRECTLY
[6:01:00] <CrankyVT> You can technically stall for time if you want to, but I'd just KO the entire board
[6:01:01] <+Greywyn00> I DEAL DAMAGE DIRECTLY TO YOUR BANK ACCOUNT
[6:01:03] <KingVantq> @patstaresat its just RPS
[6:01:04] <+zanzibar_junker> It's easy
[6:01:04] <%Too_Much_Nukie> JUST RELAX AND REMEMBER POKEMON
[6:01:04] <Zarkith> It's actually really simple, it's just rock paper scissors
[6:01:06] <Blank9> just remember rock paper scissors and look at gauges
[6:01:06] <%JaydenSai> It isnt actually
[6:01:06] <+Link232> Note shareholder shield can be different than their actual color
[6:01:09] <MasterTonberry23> I'm sure it will be more clear once we start
[6:01:10] <fIashman92> Pokemon element system
[6:01:12] <Blank9> it's easier than you think
[6:01:12] <xwiishirex> TL;DR - Keep the money givers happy.
[6:01:14] <%Jekado> I hate how after you rank 1 there isn't much to do just kinda wait around for grinding money
[6:01:14] <%za7az> psaBig psaWrong
[6:01:19] <%BoxNavy> :)
[6:01:21] <%AtlasMcCoy> DISMAL
[6:01:24] <MasterTonberry23> The people's eyebrow?
[6:01:28] <st_jimmy456> why are so many people invested in this random shop?
[6:01:28] <+zanzibar_junker> It's like rock paper scissors
[6:01:29] <+Grayhammatter> SourPls
[6:01:32] <huskarl_zap> waste as much time as possible
[6:01:34] <+krispen_wa> D - DISMAL!
[6:01:35] <+lordericter> wow Pat how'd you do so bad
[6:01:39] <%Too_Much_Nukie> WATER TYPE BEATS FIRE
[6:01:42] <+CourageTheCat> SHIT
[6:01:42] <Blank9> red is weak to blue
[6:01:43] <$lotharrio> Blue!
[6:01:44] <Maleicus> make sure your employess are happy before meetings
[6:01:46] <huskarl_zap> victory is staying above 50 percent
[6:01:46] <akitanito> Use blue
[6:01:46] <The_Legendairy> ROCK PAPER SCISSORS
[6:01:46] <xwiishirex> Guy on left, related to Shimano?
[6:01:47] <CrankyVT> You have to hit the color its weak to
[6:01:47] <$lotharrio> Sales volume is what will make you money. But if your store's stats don't match it, then you won't make as much as you could. So you want to increase sales volume while keeping your store's stats blue/acceptable. Upgrading the store can do most of the work early on. The rest of the work will be done by your staff. Omelette is low-key one of the better hires in the game, and one of the old women is also fantastic. The baseball guy is also very strong.
[6:01:48] <KingVantq> @patstaresat you can pause
[6:01:48] <%zajoestar> blue beats red

[6:04:39] <%zajoestar> no
[6:04:39] <CrankyVT> @PatStaresAt No, attack with what's weak. The shout they have is a different color than their element
[6:04:39] <%MyNameIsRasus> No
[6:04:40] <+alzeizt> no
[6:04:41] <madtrixr> you attack with green that beats blue
[6:04:42] <fuji_92> RPS
[6:04:42] <wrydiculous> rock paper scissors
[6:04:43] <Blank9> beat the text box first, it'll say WEAK
[6:04:43] <%JaydenSai> Pokemon rules
[6:04:43] <tattleworm> pokemon, but then the counter can be a different colour
[6:04:44] <%Monkeyweed21> attack blue with green
[6:04:44] <GigaSeifer> no, always use the better colour in the corner
[6:04:45] <Zebroneath> colors beat other colors
[6:04:45] <televisedrevolting> It's just Rock Paper Scissors
[6:04:46] <KingVantq> think pokemon elements
[6:04:48] <tsuchi7> Their arguments can be different colours
[6:04:48] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Use pokemon type advantage, but the person attacking might have different types than their shout.
[6:04:49] <Blank9> then beat the person's color
[6:04:49] <+Link232> The counter matrix is in the bottom left, you rock-paper-scissors counter the shield counter first, then the actual shareholder's color first
[6:04:50] <%Solipsist_Construct> no, look for "weak"
[6:04:51] <%seraphimjordan> no its rock paper scissors
[6:04:51] <fIashman92> There's bubble element, and enemy element
[6:04:51] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> its rock paper scissor pat
[6:04:51] <NeroInfinite> Jsut pokemon it
[6:04:51] <%BoxNavy> its pokemon starters
[6:04:55] <sponsoredviewer910> no break blue with green then attack with highest charisma
[6:04:55] <CrankyVT> So you use the weak color against their shout, and then weak color against their own personal color
[6:04:55] <%ClericOfSparda> Blue beats red, red beats green, green beats blue
[6:04:56] <$Afterman_> its rock paper scissors
[6:04:57] <mattynezz> Each COMPLAINT has an element
[6:04:57] <+krispen_wa> R>G>B>R
[6:04:59] <%Deano8817> theeere it is
[6:05:01] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You still won.
[6:05:03] <$Afterman_> but yes info overload
[6:05:05] <madtrixr> it'll say WEAK! when you have the right attack
[6:05:06] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> the bottom left shows the elements
[6:05:07] <+rorgalsina> it's okay :)
[6:05:08] <akitanito> true
[6:05:08] <TundraOW> Look at their persuasiveness score, it's like a power level
[6:05:08] <GigaSeifer> you R/P/S the shield, then you R/P/S the person
[6:05:09] <Blank9> it's like a shield to break, then the person
[6:05:09] <redrins> and then mash the attacks
[6:05:10] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah it's overly complicated visuals for a simple game.
[6:05:11] <KingVantq> yeah it doesn't explain it well
[6:05:11] <%roscoe_rosaline> Pokemon but business. :D
[6:05:12] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> yeah
[6:05:12] <Zebroneath> the tutorial really should have had images with them
[6:05:12] <madtrixr> for the voice concern
[6:05:13] <%MyNameIsRasus> That's fair
[6:05:13] <CrankyVT> Its all good, its a rough start for everyone
[6:05:14] <TundraOW> The baseball man is very persuasive
[6:05:14] <%Jekado> why i made you that quick guide pat...
[6:05:14] <Louie_Salmon> It's a lot, but really not too bad.
[6:05:17] <prhymes321> red beat green green beats blue blue beats red
[6:05:18] <SGrim> It's rock paper scissors but colors
[6:05:19] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You still perfected it and got the best result.

[6:10:30] <%Jekado> you can also promote and level them
[6:10:31] <fIashman92> Take a loan and max the shop
[6:10:32] <%shunakiyama> yeah

[6:10:36] <xwiishirex> Chickens > Regular People *Yakuza series logic*

[6:10:43] <%ClericOfSparda> promote or train employees for better stats
[6:10:45] <+Link232> If you can't afford to buy more shops/upgrade the shop you can just run it
[6:10:45] <madtrixr> dont promote juuuuust yet
[6:10:46] <%Dova573> Promotion also increases thier salary
[6:10:46] <CrankyVT> Don't promote until you have more money
[6:10:48] <sponsoredviewer910> no
[6:10:49] <+zanzibar_junker> Run it
[6:10:52] <CrankyVT> Promotions increase their salary you gotta pay
[6:10:53] <%Dova573> So be careful
[6:10:53] <Maleicus> you can take a loan and buy a new store
[6:10:54] <madtrixr> just run it
[6:10:54] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> you need to buy a property.

[6:10:58] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You don't need to promote yet.
[6:10:59] <%Jekado> no don't need to
[6:11:00] <TundraOW> Promoting increases their salary
[6:11:00] <+Link232> It's health/EXP boost/Max level/Fire
[6:11:00] <xwiishirex> ALL OR NOTHING, COWARDS!
[6:11:01] <xbb1024> promoting to increase level cap
[6:11:03] <Louie_Salmon> Care is cheaper than promotion
[6:11:04] <$lotharrio> Upgrade this store to max
[6:11:05] <sautong97> why not get a second property?
[6:11:05] <+alzeizt> you have no money
[6:11:06] <%roscoe_rosaline> Let it run!
[6:11:09] <%JaydenSai> @PatStaresAt Promotions mean increased salary, i'd hold off
[6:11:09] <%zajoestar> think you might wanna handle this whole management thing offscreen
[6:11:09] <xwiishirex> BECOME 100!
[6:11:10] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You're making good money, don't break what's working.
[6:11:11] <fIashman92> Take a loan and max the shop
[6:11:17] <+zanzibar_junker> The profit is good
[6:11:17] <%Jekado> you only promot when you need them to level up
[6:11:17] <dots4eyes> Motivated
[6:11:18] <CrankyVT> Only promote characters when you need to raise stats for board meetings or chance their gauge stat increases
[6:11:20] <%Jekado> everyone is fine
[6:11:25] <Louie_Salmon> @fiashman92 Can't take a loan yet
[6:11:25] <+Solutha> Promote unlocks levels but increase salary
[6:11:30] <huskarl_zap> money printer go BRRRRRRRT
[6:11:33] <+dante_must_die_exe> YEYE
[6:11:36] <$lotharrio> You're stuck with the cracker factory, so you might as well upgrade it to max.
[6:11:37] <%roscoe_rosaline> Now THAT'S good business!
[6:11:40] <%Jekado> infact you have too many employees but you can't fire the grandma
[6:11:47] <TundraOW> You should go into BIG DEBT to build your business faster
[6:11:49] <xwiishirex> Wait, it's literally a pyramid.

[6:12:00] <+zanzibar_junker> Garbage
[6:12:01] <wrydiculous> nop
[6:12:01] <+omenoffate> This mini game is only tough at the beginning soon it won’t matter what you do you will be swimming in cash
[6:12:04] <huskarl_zap> hes good but not now
[6:12:06] <+Spoonsire> That guy is a Home Run

[6:12:10] <xwiishirex> That's a coliseum boss!
[6:12:11] <$lotharrio> You have the best Normal/Bronze rank employees already.
[6:12:13] <akitanito> Can't make money without spending money
[6:12:13] <ManlyMcBeefington> time to promote em
[6:12:15] <UlriktheSlayer1> look at his fucking faaaace

[6:12:20] <Brunty023> Good ol' Home Run Takeshi from the Colosseum
[6:12:21] <+Link232> Probably wanna buy a new shop maybe
[6:12:23] <CrankyVT> Don't hire from the random events like these unless its a R Rarity or higher, the deposit costs for them are usually stupid
[6:12:26] <%logoth_> Homerun Takeshi Hongo
[6:12:27] <PkSilent01> NO
[6:12:27] <xwiishirex> He was in the Kiwami coliseums!
[6:12:27] <%penitentpendant> Reminds me of MGSV, where you kept getting low rank soldiers dumped into your group
[6:12:28] <TundraOW> YEAH
[6:12:28] <%zajoestar> YES
[6:12:29] <%NatK94> no
[6:12:29] <huskarl_zap> no
[6:12:29] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt I'd advise you to only hire R and higher for now, then SR and higher once they show up. Eventually SSR and higher.
[6:12:29] <TundraOW> BIG LOAN
[6:12:30] <+lordericter> nah fuck these bronze tier employees you have like 16 rainbows
[6:12:31] <$lotharrio> Take out a loan, upgrade.
[6:12:32] <Onamar> Buy another store
[6:12:33] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You don't need a loan.
[6:12:33] <aluddss> never loan
[6:12:33] <%BoxNavy> no
[6:12:34] <%BigCoffee> no
[6:12:34] <+zanzibar_junker> no
[6:12:34] <CrankyVT> You don't need to take a loan
[6:12:35] <%promessav2> yeah
[6:12:35] <wrydiculous> dont debt
[6:12:35] <Blank9> I'd say one 10 mil loan will help
[6:12:35] <%zajoestar> BIG DEBT
[6:12:35] <%roscoe_rosaline> Don't forget to check the numbers and file some reports for EXTRA business!
[6:12:36] <%Eaglestrike117> No
[6:12:36] <jcflyguy> No
[6:12:36] <huskarl_zap> NO
[6:12:37] <Blank9> from the bank
[6:12:37] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> No
[6:12:37] <%hahaha1171> you should get a new place
[6:12:38] <Maleicus> buy a new store
[6:12:38] <fuji_92> maybe idk
[6:12:39] <%Mordexai0> NO
[6:12:41] <mattynezz> No
[6:12:42] <%seraphimjordan> no!
[6:12:42] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Yes.
[6:12:43] <sponsoredviewer910> no
[6:12:43] <%HitchhikingThrough> GO IN TO DEBT YOU FUCK
[6:12:43] <tattleworm> time's running out on your investor
[6:12:43] <%rumtumtugnutz> YES
[6:12:44] <madtrixr> you could? but eh just run it
[6:12:47] <TundraOW> U.S DEFICIT TIME
[6:12:47] <%Hotironclad> you take a loan and buy new property
[6:12:48] <akitanito> loan speeds up the process
[6:12:49] <+dante_must_die_exe> BIG NO
[6:12:50] <$Wafflum> Go to Sky Finance
[6:12:51] <xwiishirex> BECOME 100!
[6:12:51] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Just get to the next shareholder meeting.
[6:12:54] <huskarl_zap> You dont need a loan to upgrade
[6:12:55] <%Mordexai0> BIG BUSINESS PAT
[6:12:55] <%Mr_Pylon> could buy more businesses soon?
[6:12:56] <CrankyVT> That's fine, you're going to be tight on money at the start
[6:12:56] <%Eaglestrike117> You need to get money to hire people
[6:12:57] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> you should focus on buying properties
[6:12:59] <xbb1024> you have a turn limit
[6:13:01] <Onamar> You're on a time limit pat
[6:13:01] <%Eaglestrike117> and then you can open more stores
[6:13:01] <Blank9> don't buy a new store yet, none of them match the current store
[6:13:02] <%promessav2> debt is important to make big money
[6:13:06] <+alzeizt> loan speeds up
[6:13:11] <GigaSeifer> most of your rank ups come from shareholder meetings
[6:13:12] <+zanzibar_junker> Just run the store do good at the share holder meeting
[6:13:17] <madtrixr> you get big bumps from shareholder meetings
[6:13:17] <xwiishirex> Chickens are better than people!
[6:13:18] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You don't need your stores to match.
[6:13:21] <%roscoe_rosaline> BUSINESS
[6:13:21] <$lotharrio> Gotta spend other people's money to make money, Pat.
[6:13:24] <prhymes321> upgrade employees
[6:13:26] <fIashman92> Debt speeds up growth
[6:13:26] <ManlyMcBeefington> promote them to be stronger for shareholder meeting
[6:13:28] <fiercefiresoul> You could be making double the cash if you had a second property and employees to run it.
[6:13:28] <%AtlasMcCoy> I like how pat keeps switching back and forth between 'Nugget' and 'Omelette'
[6:13:28] <Oxybe> BEST GIRL OMELETTE DOIN HER BEST
[6:13:31] <%Too_Much_Nukie> In fact diversifying your store type is a good idea.
[6:13:31] <Blank9> this guy is good
[6:13:34] <%Taisuru> SUCK IT 138
[6:13:36] <%NovaKnightmare> EVIL CHEF
[6:13:37] <$Marcel_BBQ> i like him
[6:13:38] <GigaSeifer> no
[6:13:38] <xwiishirex> Yet again, literally a pyramid!
[6:13:40] <$lotharrio> That guy's not bad. But your team is fine already.
[6:13:41] <%seraphimjordan> buy majhong and put hanayama there
[6:13:41] <huskarl_zap> hes good but you only have one store
[6:13:41] <melonsouda> He#s a rare
[6:13:41] <+Link232> 1 mil in deposit, no
[6:13:41] <GandhiTheTerrible> Jang's good
[6:13:42] <ArcaneMusic> snag him!
[6:13:43] <+lordericter> he seems good
[6:13:43] <CrankyVT> That's actually solid for this part of the game but it depends on his cost--
[6:13:44] <TundraOW> 1 mil
[6:13:44] <+zanzibar_junker> he's good
[6:13:44] <aluddss> HA
[6:13:45] <fuji_92> yeah I'd get him
[6:13:45] <madtrixr> nope
[6:13:45] <%Jekado> no
[6:13:45] <akitanito> 1 mil
[6:13:46] <GigaSeifer> @PatStaresAt it costs 1,050,00 to hire
[6:13:47] <%Jekado> don't
[6:13:47] <%Solipsist_Construct> hes good early on
[6:13:48] <KazMkII> big deposit
[6:13:48] <huskarl_zap> hes good in meetings too
[6:13:51] <%Jekado> for the contract
[6:13:51] <%Eaglestrike117> no
[6:13:51] <%Hotironclad> he's decent
[6:13:51] <$lotharrio> Unless you want to buy another store.
[6:13:51] <%JaydenSai> No!
[6:13:51] <madtrixr> look at that deposit
[6:13:52] <%BoxNavy> pricy though
[6:13:52] <Blank9> he'll show up again
[6:13:52] <fuji_92> nop
[6:13:53] <CrankyVT> That's 1 mil I wouldn't do it
[6:13:53] <%MyNameIsRasus> SUPER EXPENSIVE
[6:13:53] <jcflyguy> He's wasted money until you get a 2nd business
[6:13:54] <xbb1024> get a second place
[6:13:55] <%chibicheezit> that's a cool motherfucker
[6:13:55] <a_mad_dragon> 1 mil
[6:13:55] <%Jekado> you don't need new people for a while
[6:13:56] <+dante_must_die_exe> he's Rare
[6:13:56] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah it's not worth it yet.
[6:13:59] <%NovaKnightmare> MAJIMA
[6:14:01] <%penitentpendant> Not enough money to expand yet
[6:14:01] <ulcaban> 137 is almost leet
[6:14:01] <%Jekado> until you have a new buisness also
[6:14:02] <%BigCoffee> majima!?
[6:14:04] <huskarl_zap> THE BILL GATES KID
[6:14:04] <Blank9> go to employees and press X for autocare
[6:14:06] <%BoxNavy> the first number is how much you gotta pay to use him i think
[6:14:08] <huskarl_zap> ALSO PAT NO
[6:14:08] <fIashman92> You don't need more employees until you get more property
[6:14:10] <Onamar> Buy another store
[6:14:11] <Vermillion129> MAJIMAJI
[6:14:11] <CrankyVT> THE R RARITY NERD GUY IS GOOD IIRC
[6:14:11] <%bearrier_> pat you have to spend money to make money Kappa
[6:14:12] <+omenoffate> Chat is freaking out over an easy mini game lol
[6:14:13] <xwiishirex> Are you sure this isn't a pyramid scheme?
[6:14:13] <SGrim> 300 is solid
[6:14:14] <+preppyposs> BIG SERVICE
[6:14:15] <%NovaKnightmare> ok wait Kiryu '
[6:14:15] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Majima is good for shareholder meetings.
[6:14:15] <mattatatatatatatat> majima has business experience
[6:14:16] <madtrixr> majima is BUSTED in shareholder meetings
[6:14:18] <CrankyVT> He's got stupid high product stat
[6:14:18] <MasterTonberry23> pfff kiryu. not exactly layin low is he? LUL
[6:14:19] <%NovaKnightmare> kiryu's there too wtf
[6:14:20] <%Jekado> he only cost 4 stamina to attack
[6:14:20] <%BoxNavy> M A J I M A
[6:14:20] <%Too_Much_Nukie> That's why people are yelling about him.
[6:14:21] <huskarl_zap> ALL THOSE ULTRA RARES HAVE SALERYS
[6:14:22] <sautong97> when does you get a scenond store?
[6:14:22] <KazMkII> Are these DLC options?
[6:14:23] <%Jekado> he's really good but later
[6:14:23] <sponsoredviewer910> so many cheaters LUL
[6:14:23] <%promessav2> if it gets your rank up do big spend
[6:14:24] <jcflyguy> He's got Matt Mercer
[6:14:24] <Oxybe> all heart!
[6:14:26] <%Too_Much_Nukie> But you really don't need him yet.
[6:14:27] <melonsouda> I think they're just yelling because it's majima
[6:14:27] <+Link232> Oh he works nightclubs and has great service 'cause of his Nightclub experience, I like that
[6:14:31] <%Jekado> low command cost is good
[6:14:33] <%seraphimjordan> get nick
[6:14:34] <%JeanGardner99> Rare nerd is super good
[6:14:36] <%Jekado> because you can fucking spam attack
[6:14:38] <dan_g_v> sakurai?
[6:14:38] <$lotharrio> Hiro-chun is actually high tier.
[6:14:43] <%ClericOfSparda> the UR are ridiculous
[6:14:45] <%JaydenSai> Majima will cost you a lot
[6:14:46] <xwiishirex> WHERE'S RED GREEN?!
[6:14:53] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Command cost is how much it costs to have them attack in shareholder meetings.
[6:14:54] <madtrixr> in the meetings, the command cost is needed to use the employee
[6:14:57] <%NovaKnightmare> honestly Kiryu would be a great businessman bnased on his 80s experience
[6:14:57] <%BoxNavy> i guess keep going until shareholder meetings???
[6:14:57] <Blank9> care for your employees though, otherwise they ask for raises more
[6:14:57] <madtrixr> majimas is 4
[6:15:00] <%Too_Much_Nukie> So Majima is easy to spam.
[6:15:02] <$lotharrio> If you don't have another store, then 4 employees is already a lot.
[6:15:03] <xwiishirex> Duct tape is Forever!
[6:15:04] <%Jekado> command cost is how much stamina is need for them to "attack" during a meeting
[6:15:04] <CrankyVT> Command Cost is how much energy it takes to use their attack. Lower is better
[6:15:05] <madtrixr> thats insanely lower than everyone else
[6:15:06] <beefcakemanthrob> 4 command is real good
[6:15:06] <huskarl_zap> The only ultra you need is majima because hes only 4 or five to cast in meetings
[6:15:06] <akitanito> think PP
[6:15:11] <+Solutha> Wow only 4? Big cheats
[6:15:12] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> Don't hire any of the UR ranks right now
[6:15:18] <%zajoestar> MAKE SURE ALL EMPLOYEES ARE GREEN FOR SHAREHOLDER MEETINGS
[6:15:25] <%Jekado> max out the senbei shop is what i would do
[6:15:25] <madtrixr> yeah majima is shareholder easy mode
[6:15:32] <%Jekado> since the senbei shop is really good early
[6:15:36] <%roscoe_rosaline> This is the most BUSINESS business I've ever seen!
[6:15:38] <%Dova573> Vergil likes all this motivation
[6:15:40] <MasterTonberry23> seriously the idea that kiryu and majima are spending their retirement years doing part time work makes me smile XD
[6:15:43] <%Taisuru> NUMBER. GO. UP/
[6:15:46] <Louie_Salmon> Well for these early sharerholder meetings it isn't hard anyway
[6:15:52] <xwiishirex> Majima would just threaten with a knife.
[6:15:58] <+zanzibar_junker> bbbboooo
[6:15:58] <PatchySouls> there's SO MUCH economics
[6:16:02] <+zanzibar_junker> SAVE
[6:16:04] <+Link232> Exit out and save before every shareholder
[6:16:05] <CrankyVT> All your actual rank increases will be from shareholder meetings, so your focus during this part is just managing facilities while staying out of the red
[6:16:07] <bleugh> profit go up
[6:16:08] <huskarl_zap> HOT TOPIC PogChamp I AM THE STORM THAT IS APPROACHING
[6:16:08] <+Link232> *Just in case*

[6:16:33] <%roscoe_rosaline> The true business was the savescumming we did along the way!
[6:16:33] <%HitchhikingThrough> The chicken's just standing on the desk LUL
[6:16:37] <Saltmeisterr> So how does ichiban make money here
[6:16:38] <Blank9> it's pretty easy to blow through, shareholder meetings are practically all you need to nail
[6:16:40] <madtrixr> promotions are uneeded at this time
[6:16:41] <%coreyyotto> because the company's net worth is down
[6:16:41] <+krispen_wa> He HATES it
[6:16:43] <%ClericOfSparda> Do a level 3 Ichiban. it's hilarious
[6:16:43] <%blindoldninja> blindoldninja subscribed with Prime. 
[6:16:43] <+zanzibar_junker> Fight happy first
[6:16:45] <Onamar> Promote your employees and start upgrading
[6:16:48] <Louie_Salmon> So is Pat aware he's been paying an extra employee to do nothing for like 4 business cycles or what
[6:16:50] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah the business stuff in-between shareholder meetings is just about maximizing profit to be able to afford to train/promote employees.
[6:16:51] <%AtlasMcCoy> DISMAL
[6:16:57] <CrankyVT> @Saltmeisterr He gets an executive bonus after every successful board meeting
[6:17:01] <%coreyyotto> but net worth and sales are in the shit
[6:17:05] <+krispen_wa> D - DISMAL!

[6:18:40] <CrankyVT> No no you can

[6:18:42] <%HitchhikingThrough> Man y'all are cold
[6:18:42] <$lotharrio> No, you want her for her product work. For now.

[6:18:56] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> no need to fire anyone right now
[6:18:57] <huskarl_zap> PAT there was a whole substory about not being able to fire people
[6:18:57] <CrankyVT> I'd suggest I think the laundromat? It should be an easy buy and manage
[6:18:59] <%ClericOfSparda> honestly save them for a second business
[6:19:01] <Onamar> Buy a new property
[6:19:02] <CrankyVT> No no
[6:19:04] <Louie_Salmon> It isn't too much of a cost anyway, just 30K

[6:19:19] <NeroInfinite> too late
[6:19:20] <CrankyVT> oh well
[6:19:22] <%MyNameIsRasus> Buy another one instead

[6:23:25] <Louie_Salmon> He's capped, he needs a promotion for more

[6:23:37] <bleugh> is it the same nugget from yakuza 0?
[6:23:38] <%BoxNavy> theres an up arrow dude
[6:23:39] <%AlteisenReiseZ> AlteisenReiseZ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months, currently on a 8 month streak! Congratulations, you've given birth to a happy and healthy sub baby! Now it's time for this baby to make his PC run super fast! (oh god let me find at least an ok gpu)
[6:23:39] <%AzureGale> Notice me, senpai
[6:23:39] <%Taisuru> Notice Nugget Sempai

[6:23:43] <+krispen_wa> You noticed them senpai
[6:23:44] <+Solutha> PROMOTOINS
[6:23:44] <jcflyguy> Salary doubles, careful
[6:23:45] <Blank9> it's very not good
[6:23:46] <huskarl_zap> dont promote everyone
[6:23:47] <%Jekado> promotions raise cost so be careful
[6:23:49] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> remember that the salary also goes up apt
[6:23:49] <xwiishirex> You noticed them, Senpai!
[6:23:50] <+tetraes> promote nugget
[6:23:52] <ProfessorLuigi> I hopd my boss notices me today
[6:23:54] <extradopeness> Notice meeeeeeeeee
[6:24:00] <dan_g_v> notice them Pat senpai
[6:24:00] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Promoting Omelette is a good idea. Omelette becomes an absolute beast as a senior director.
[6:24:02] <Blank9> you're paying them twice as much for doing 3% better
[6:24:04] <akitanito> you doubled labour cost
[6:24:05] <%stabbityrabbit> Red is good, notice is promote, and breakers can't break things. Come on Pat. Get with it.
[6:24:07] <+Grayhammatter> 60k yen for a chicken? what...
[6:24:10] <tattleworm> might as well max upgrade anything you can't get rid of, granny, nugget2 and shop
[6:24:10] <dots4eyes> Who's Nugget? That's Omelette. Kappa
[6:24:10] <CrankyVT> With him making a million per round right now that up in their salary's a drop in the bucket atm
[6:24:15] <%roscoe_rosaline> This is the highest level business! These anual reports! Those meetings!
[6:24:17] <%BoxNavy> A L I T T L E B I T
[6:24:19] <xwiishirex> ALL OR NOTHING!
[6:24:20] <GigaSeifer> ignore people worried about salary, it's negligible. Once you max out the chicken, he can run the first store alone
[6:24:24] <xwiishirex> BECOME 100!
[6:24:29] <madtrixr> i guess its an investment in the future
[6:24:30] <%Dova573> how uncapitalist of you pat

[6:42:30] <%shiplord13> @PatStaresAt I've always wondered do you remind Paige of her father?
[6:42:30] <%roscoe_rosaline> Head empty, no thoughts
[6:42:32] <Maleicus> tojo probably died because kiryu stopped trying
[6:42:33] <%weissguard> Kiryu is loyal and dutiful to a fault, and it comes back to haunt him constantly.
[6:42:34] <%AtlasMcCoy> His SINGLE SMART DECISION
[6:42:34] <%BoxNavy> man i feel kinda bad for kiryu in that regard
[6:42:37] <Blank9> he still likes the person, but fuck the organization
[6:42:37] <%promessav2> well eventually it's gonna ome back around
[6:42:38] <%ClericOfSparda> He really is, isn't he?
[6:42:39] <@SoFarFetched> get reading for that ICHIBONE
[6:42:40] <+krispen_wa> He's a dumbass, but he's wiser than Kiryu
[6:42:45] <FlamingoJazz> Ichiban did take a bullet.

[6:42:53] <ShichiNoBushi> Kiryu was the "Dragon of Dojima". Ichiban was a nobody.
[6:42:57] <colzack_> He said earlier on that he still considers himself an arakawa family member tho
[6:42:58] <melonsouda> Kiryu couldn't stay away, but I feel like Ichiban's going to keep getting pulled in
[6:42:59] <danielm427> and tojo clan got fuck
[6:42:59] <Oxybe> Kiryu is a Yakuzi's Yakuzi. Ichi is ahimbo.

[6:50:00] <%Jekado> you can get like one person to run it
[6:50:00] <+Link232> Yeah
[6:50:01] <madtrixr> kind of
[6:50:02] <%ClericOfSparda> BUY ANOTHER PROPERTY
[6:50:03] <huskarl_zap> no
[6:50:04] <%Solipsist_Construct> mostly

[6:50:07] <+zanzibar_junker> yes

[6:50:07] <%ClericOfSparda> sorta
[6:50:08] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You can run this shop with 1 person in the late game.
[6:50:08] <danielm427> max everythingh
[6:50:08] <Blank9> it does let you staff it with worse people
[6:50:09] <%penitentpendant> You can understaff it
[6:50:10] <$lotharrio> Yeah, with like one guy who is okay at everything, probably.
[6:50:10] <melonsouda> I assume so
[6:50:11] <+abrupt_abe> You'll almost always need someone
[6:50:12] <Oxybe> LET OMELETTE BE THE BOSS BITCH
[6:50:12] <%Jekado> CHICKEN SENBEI SHOP
[6:50:12] <aluddss> minimum 1 I think?
[6:50:13] <huskarl_zap> atleast one staff is required
[6:50:13] <xGeneralDOOM> wallstreet lvl of investment PogChamp
[6:50:14] <%bevyrage> you can eventually get it to where only omelette can staff the cracker shop
[6:50:14] <dynamic_funk> oh no......no no......
[6:50:15] <fuji_92> but buy new shit
[6:50:20] <Noogiez> chicken
[6:50:21] <fIashman92> You can staff it with less employees or possibly no one
[6:50:22] <xbb1024> getting another place = diversify
[6:50:24] <%BoxNavy> robot staff monkaS
[6:50:25] <GigaSeifer> if you level up the medal skill then chicken can solo right now I think
[6:50:30] <+preppyposs> not yety
[6:50:31] <+VeryCaffeinatedCat> get the Nick guy and he can work by himself on lots of properties
[6:50:32] <a_mad_dragon> NOT YET YOU CAN'T
[6:50:32] <Blank9> but no one you have is good enough to do it alone
[6:50:32] <%promessav2> better to level more members
[6:50:34] <%Jekado> but they need to be leveled a bit i think
[6:50:35] <%ClericOfSparda> Use the other old woman
[6:50:38] <%roscoe_rosaline> HELL YEAH HELL YEAH
[6:50:45] <%BoxNavy> do it
[6:50:48] <Zarkith> If he leveled up, he might be able to solo it
[6:50:48] <GigaSeifer> @PatStaresAt 1 rank of notability should let Omelette solo
[6:50:51] <@SoFarFetched> yeah its still low
[6:50:54] <%MyNameIsRasus> Need better more trained employees
[6:50:58] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah at that point it might not be worth it
[6:51:02] <%Jekado> you need someone for the middle stat
[6:51:03] <Onamar> Need better employees
[6:51:05] <%Cerephesis> Omelette du Fromage
[6:51:09] <%roscoe_rosaline> These business plays have me on the edge of my seat!
[6:51:12] <GigaSeifer> @pat might need to train omelette
[6:51:13] <+preppyposs> not yet pat
[6:51:13] <%Too_Much_Nukie> No they need to be matching service.
[6:51:14] <KazMkII> What is he doing?
[6:51:15] <%penitentpendant> Nope, Omlette not high enough
[6:51:16] <dynamic_funk> there is no way 1 store will be enough
[6:51:18] <%bevyrage> or you can promote?
[6:51:21] <%TheMattman1313> Hire a better employee
[6:51:22] <%Jekado> you can level up the chicken but it cost a lot early on
[6:51:28] <%Jekado> you have to level him a bit
[6:51:29] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Your silver could do it if you upgrade the stuff.
[6:51:32] <%stabbityrabbit> I think for the time being you need two employees still.
[6:51:32] <%ClericOfSparda> dude use 3 employees
[6:51:36] <%BoxNavy> 🐓

[6:54:04] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt If an employee matches the building type they get a bonus to their meters but that's it. It doesn't affect profit directly.
[6:54:08] <Onamar> Get a new employee
[6:54:10] <wrydiculous> just upgrade works as well
[6:54:13] <dan_g_v> we need more rice and eggs
[6:54:14] <%Jekado> you can probably do a round of upgrades and get buy
[6:54:16] <Louie_Salmon> I think you can jump like two levels in sales volume right now, comfortably
[6:54:21] <%Jekado> yee
[6:54:22] <fuji_92> buy a 3rd shop now and employees
[6:54:32] <GigaSeifer> @PatStaresAt try to hold onto the 5 mil for commercials

[6:54:59] <%Eaglestrike117> Staff
[6:55:03] <+Grayhammatter> might need some more employees
[6:55:04] <GigaSeifer> PINKY RABBIT
[6:55:04] <gk1llah> fair enough
[6:55:07] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[6:55:08] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> wait until you get the discount to hire more employees
[6:55:22] <fIashman92> Now would be a good time for a loan
[6:55:23] <%koolaid_kevster> checck the staff befor eyou invest i think
[6:55:26] <fuji_92> chat stop backsiting
[6:55:27] <+preppyposs> BRINGING IN 4 MIL PAT
[6:55:31] <$lotharrio> The extra money coming in would be better.
[6:55:32] <+Link232> The onboarding discount isn't much I don't think
[6:55:34] <%DamnFineCupofStreaming> raise level cap for the ones you got
[6:55:34] <akitanito> just do business for time being
[6:55:35] <TundraOW> Relax he's doing fine
[6:55:35] <+VeryCaffeinatedCat> get nick to run a business by himselfff
[6:55:38] <Onamar> Not that expensive
[6:55:38] <%ClericOfSparda> 4MIL Profits!
[6:55:39] <Louie_Salmon> The discount isn't that big, might be worth to start profiting now
[6:55:40] <GigaSeifer> @PatStaresAt just buy it, upgrade it to the boint you can staff it with anybody
[6:55:41] <huskarl_zap> MAJIMA
[6:55:41] <fIashman92> All around bad, min max good
[6:55:43] <GigaSeifer> yeah, she's good
[6:55:47] <%Too_Much_Nukie> I used Hidemi for a long time.
[6:55:52] <Louie_Salmon> You could always cheat
[6:55:53] <akitanito> the bar?
[6:55:54] <$lotharrio> She might be really good at running your cracker show.
[6:55:55] <+zanzibar_junker> glasses guy is good
[6:55:57] <GigaSeifer> PINKY RABBIT
[6:56:01] <huskarl_zap> leave some liquid funds
[6:56:01] <$thomassolorio> what about majimaaaaaaa
[6:56:05] <@SoFarFetched> "So I cheated off screen"
[6:56:06] <fIashman92> All arounders are bad, min maxers are good
[6:56:08] <%BoxNavy> THATS A SEXWHORE
[6:56:11] <%Monkeyweed21> YEAH SEX WHORES
[6:56:12] <sponsoredviewer910> you already paid for the cheat, why not use it
[6:56:12] <%roscoe_rosaline> Sex whore!
[6:56:15] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Pinky Rabbit isn't worth it.
[6:56:16] <SharKinStereo> sushi is food I think
[6:56:21] <GigaSeifer> Brillio is actualyl probably better
[6:56:24] <+Grayhammatter> a sex whore you say?
[6:56:26] <Noogiez> sushi?
[6:56:27] <%Jekado> not at good profit tho
[6:56:28] <+Link232> Brillo is decent but difficult to manage if you don't have good employees for product
[6:56:29] <$lotharrio> You want a good Sales Volume-Property Maintenance value.
[6:56:32] <madtrixr> brillo is better yeah
[6:56:32] <+zanzibar_junker> coin laundry
[6:56:36] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @sponsoredviewer910 Their salaries start at 150k that's why
[6:56:38] <%JeanGardner99> check maintenence vs sales volume
[6:56:40] <NeroInfinite> Yeah
[6:56:41] <%BoxNavy> indeed!
[6:56:41] <fuji_92> sushi indeed
[6:56:43] <%ClericOfSparda> Sushi is an abomination against the lord!
[6:56:47] <%Jekado> but starting max is better
[6:56:49] <GigaSeifer> that one's great
[6:56:55] <GigaSeifer> get the picture gallery
[6:56:56] <+VeryCaffeinatedCat> yee do that one the gallery
[6:57:01] <$thomassolorio> is this how you get MAJIMA as a suman
[6:57:04] <madtrixr> the sushi place seemed to suck
[6:57:08] <%Eaglestrike117> Yo that sushi place has a 1 mil starting sales volume
[6:57:09] <huskarl_zap> arts meh
[6:57:10] <%Jekado> higher sales volume is better starting out anyways since most upgrades don't go above the higher ones
[6:57:10] <madtrixr> oana security was good though
[6:57:14] <fIashman92> You wont be able to hit cap on that one because the bottom stat is very hard to get
[6:57:15] <%BoxNavy> they really went all in with this huh
[6:57:16] <%DamnFineCupofStreaming> gonna own a gallery staffed by a chicken alone
[6:57:18] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Picture gallery is great but it's hard to staff early on. Make sure to get good people for it.
[6:57:26] <%roscoe_rosaline> Buy business to make more business!
[6:57:31] <GigaSeifer> hire nice old lady and let her run the gallery alone after you upgrade it
[6:57:32] <+krispen_wa> HIRE YUKI
[6:57:37] <%rdark_ksu> spend spend spend
[6:57:42] <madtrixr> no she a cheat
[6:57:45] <%penitentpendant> Oof, their signing bonuses
[6:57:45] <%stabbityrabbit> Use the cheat ones. You got em, employem 'em.
[6:57:45] <$lotharrio> Hiro-Chun is great. Competetitve until the end of this.
[6:57:46] <SharKinStereo> you need a blue with those tho
[6:57:47] <$thomassolorio> your just fucking with us now lol
[6:57:47] <dan_g_v> let's go for cheap?
[6:57:49] <TundraOW> Yuki is an SR from the cheat DLC
[6:57:55] <xbb1024> Yuki is the DLC
[6:58:00] <fuji_92> he won't hire cheats chat
[6:58:07] <Louie_Salmon> Pat is graciously holding back the big cheats
[6:58:08] <Louie_Salmon> For now
[6:58:09] <GigaSeifer> the ideal is to solo staff them
[6:58:12] <+krispen_wa> SHE CUTE THO
[6:58:14] <SharKinStereo> you need more blues
[6:58:16] <%shunakiyama> Cheat DLC is super cheese. makes management mode a an absolute cakewalk
[6:58:17] <ShichiNoBushi> He's not using the bonus DLC employees. They are expensive at this point.
[6:58:23] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Yuki was Majima's top hostess in 0, that's who they're talking about.
[6:58:23] <Louie_Salmon> (He will immediately cheat off-stream)
[6:58:35] <%Monkeyweed21> swap old man and old lady
[6:58:36] <+zanzibar_junker> old guy leads
[6:58:37] <akitanito> slightly
[6:58:43] <%ClericOfSparda> Assign the old man as leader!
[6:58:50] <GigaSeifer> but it could make a BIGGER profit
[6:58:50] <%BoxNavy> sick
[6:58:50] <%koolaid_kevster> SERVICE STARTO!
[6:58:55] <ghostkingwho> save 4 million for the commercial
[6:59:02] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt From this point on keep 5 mil on hand for commercials.
[6:59:05] <$Marcel_BBQ> Big cheats are happening the moment stream turns off
[6:59:06] <colzack_> Save some for ads
[6:59:10] <madtrixr> 5
[6:59:10] <Louie_Salmon> This is looking good
[6:59:12] <madtrixr> but yeah
[6:59:14] <fIashman92> Your third employee is bad at that
[6:59:17] <Noogiez> run it boiiiii
[6:59:20] <+Link232> He makes 5 mil in profit, he doesn't need to save
[6:59:20] <$lotharrio> Yeah, you want 5million just in case of commercials.
[6:59:26] <%penitentpendant> Much profit
[6:59:27] <+preppyposs> RUN THE BUSINESS
[6:59:28] <+Grayhammatter> 5 millions profit, wow
[6:59:28] <dan_g_v> remember to rotate saves

[7:01:03] <%coreyyotto> Remember kids, don't skip commercials

[7:03:41] <akitanito> holyshit rice crackers
[7:03:41] <+Grayhammatter> that's so fucking stupid, i love it
[7:03:43] <%kyh9> HOLY FUCK
[7:03:46] <+CourageTheCat> LMAOOOOOO
[7:03:49] <+tigerfang86> holy SHIT THIS PAYOUT
[7:03:51] <madtrixr> also LOOK AT THOSE NUMBERS
[7:03:59] <+Link232> If they're at max level they won't levle until you promote
[7:03:59] <%Broken_Sonex> HE'S ON TV NOW??!?!?
[7:03:59] <NeroInfinite> Because maxed cap
[7:04:01] <%kyh9> ICHIBAN OF ICHIBAN CONFECTIONS?!
[7:04:02] <akitanito> exp depends on profits?
[7:04:04] <madtrixr> ALWAYS INVEST IN COMMERCIALS
[7:04:04] <%coreyyotto> EXP required increases dramatically
[7:04:05] <%Too_Much_Nukie> It's based on how many green events happen during the business run.
[7:04:06] <+Link232> Also passive EXP gets really small for high level employees
[7:04:06] <FlamingoJazz> I'm going to be 100 % real chat. I have no clue what's happening...
[7:04:06] <fuji_92> they are just slower
[7:04:07] <Monkey_D_Judd> Higher rarity is harder to level
[7:04:07] <%Xevtes> LEVEL CAP.... PROMOTE THEM
[7:04:07] <GandhiTheTerrible> xp required is higher
[7:04:07] <+VeryCaffeinatedCat> theyve hit max for their position
[7:04:08] <%linSP> bruh can you just play this minigame
[7:04:09] <+lordericter> wait so now you're a famous CEO where do we go from here
[7:04:12] <%penitentpendant> They're different levels, so the lowbies are leveling faster
[7:04:14] <Enderou> the first thing i walk into is english dub and pat exclaiming this game rules. think i'll buy it i guess
[7:04:14] <Louie_Salmon> It scales by level, like an RPG
[7:04:20] <%BoxNavy> oh the ad is still on
[7:04:24] <+dudeenoch> exponential curve i guess?
[7:04:24] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You can't hit max for a position.
[7:04:25] <$thomassolorio> dude that was the best commercial ever
[7:04:27] <GigaSeifer> it takes more exp for a level 8 than a level 2
[7:04:29] <Onamar> It just takes longer when they're higher level
[7:04:31] <+zanzibar_junker> part time employees are only five
[7:04:31] <tanarath> @patstaresat Because of their cap, promote them
[7:04:35] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Ads run for 3 business turns.
[7:04:35] <%Kitafin> require more exp
[7:04:36] <fuji_92> exponential curve pat
[7:04:36] <tattleworm> promote granny?
[7:04:37] <madtrixr> yep it runs for the other 3 periods
[7:04:38] <%Jekado> ad stays for a while its pretty dope
[7:04:39] <Blank9> pat, levels don't make a big difference
[7:04:39] <+preppyposs> @PatStaresAt RPG levels
[7:04:42] <%roscoe_rosaline> They just need more exp for next level is all
[7:04:43] <%Jekado> later on you always ad
[7:04:43] <%BoxNavy> heal and run it again
[7:04:44] <%ClericOfSparda> Ad's are ALWAYS worth it
[7:04:44] <+taltalheights> I hope Arakawa sees all this
[7:04:50] <@SoFarFetched> Chat can't read geefBlind geefBlind geefBlind
[7:04:52] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Ads are ALWAYS worth it.
[7:04:54] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Always.
[7:04:55] <Louie_Salmon> Could maybe get another store going
[7:04:58] <%Jekado> levels really only matter for shareholders
[7:04:59] <%coreyyotto> levels DO make a difference during shareholder meetings
[7:05:00] <sponsoredviewer910> high level needs more xp
[7:05:01] <ChungusQuest> old lady #2 at cap?
[7:05:03] <fuji_92> higher lvls up slower
[7:05:04] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> it takes longer to level up at higher levels
[7:05:08] <madtrixr> it seems levels only matter for shareholder meetings
[7:05:08] <%promessav2> how much profit is there on a level 1 vs 10 or 8 vs 10
[7:05:09] <dan_g_v> all his yakuzi friends are watching the ads
[7:05:10] <%roscoe_rosaline> Chat bad at business ):
[7:05:13] <%Jekado> you only really need 4 people maxes at shareholders anyways
[7:05:13] <%ElectricEmissary> has pat shit his pants yet?
[7:05:15] <ulcaban> Guys, her favourite food is Ichiban
[7:05:16] <+dudeenoch> it's just require more exp for each new level up
[7:05:17] <%BoxNavy> no one is at cap
[7:05:19] <madtrixr> and the level uncapping is what affects buisness stats?
[7:05:22] <%Jekado> the rest of the employees need to be just good enough
[7:05:23] <+preppyposs> CLOSE
[7:05:24] <%Too_Much_Nukie> UPGRADE THAT TWICE
[7:05:26] <@SoFarFetched> I bet chat is someone who puts all their money into the FX
[7:05:30] <MasterTonberry23> they should have an alternate ending where ichiban gives up the main quest and just becomes a wealthy businessman LUL
[7:05:30] <GigaSeifer> @PatStaresAt upgrade it, then upgrade him
[7:05:32] <tsuchi7> train that guy
[7:05:33] <%stabbityrabbit> Remember that dude at the beginning of the game who hated Ichiban for not earning money?
[7:05:36] <Rafoki> train guy?
[7:05:40] <$lotharrio> If you sort by property, the people who aren't in any show up at the bottom.
[7:05:43] <GigaSeifer> of course I'm right
[7:05:43] <%Jekado> @SoFarFetched WutFace
[7:05:56] <Louie_Salmon> But will he upgrade enough?
[7:06:07] <%pepzi_boyz> I study business in uni, I can confirm this is how management works
[7:06:11] <GigaSeifer> that's what I was saying earlier, level 30 Omelette can run the maxed out confectionary alone
[7:06:18] <+dudeenoch> though you can sorta tell by the little icon with the building and the number
[7:06:23] <g0d_zill4> i believe employees who chime up and say stuff indicating their good performance during the business earning section earn more xp
[7:06:24] <+VeryCaffeinatedCat> NUUUUU
[7:06:28] <fIashman92> Stat growth is highly curved and first 20 levels are not worth it
[7:06:35] <%JaydenSai> That would be pretty Poggers, Pat @PatStaresAt
[7:06:35] <%penitentpendant> Just a small mistake
[7:06:36] <+Solutha> Ooof that waste
[7:06:41] <+Grayhammatter> you indeed fucked that up
[7:06:43] <Vermillion129> oh god that's a lot of xp missed
[7:06:54] <%roscoe_rosaline> True BUSINESS is build on the mistakes we make!
[7:07:02] <Kiaayo> just throwing money down the toilet
[7:07:07] <dan_g_v> did we rotate the saves?
[7:07:08] <zipperdude33> I just showed up and Pat already fucked something up
[7:07:09] <$lotharrio> Cutting so hard into your profits. I love it. Feed those goblins, Pat.
[7:07:11] <+tigerfang86> C A S H
[7:07:13] <Louie_Salmon> Well alright then
[7:07:13] <MasterTonberry23> Pat only listen to chat never think for yourself LUL
[7:07:14] <+VeryCaffeinatedCat> OOF
[7:07:17] <+preppyposs> PAT NEEDS TO PROVE IT TO HIMSELF
[7:07:20] <GigaSeifer> perfect
[7:07:21] <%rdark_ksu> yea
[7:07:21] <NeroInfinite> now he's running it by himself
[7:07:21] <%shunakiyama> lol what a waste of money
[7:07:21] <Onamar> Waste
[7:07:25] <televisedrevolting> Watching Pat play makes me realize I'm shit at business, but good at convincing the stockholders otherwise
[7:07:26] <+abrupt_abe> @patstaresat You can just press x at this menu instead of going in and out to switch
[7:07:26] <seaechiowai> psaBig HSWP
[7:07:26] <Blank9> it'll work
[7:07:27] <akitanito> how much money did you waste to save on the granny?
[7:07:30] <+Link232> Yeah this was basically just a vanity project but still goo djob pat
[7:07:33] <madtrixr> hey if it makes him happy
[7:07:33] <%rdark_ksu> flyin solo
[7:07:37] <BarbershopSean> you always look so relaxed. nice skeleton btw
[7:07:37] <cherrycottontail> 30k on 1 staff or 10 mil on 1 staff which is better
[7:07:39] <Blank9> now his salary is as much as 4 people's
[7:07:39] <$lotharrio> Well fire that old woman, then.
[7:07:42] <+TDAWS_MP132> don't forget to heal employees
[7:07:47] <%Monkeyweed21> He gets paid more than all your other employees combined @PatStaresAt
[7:07:48] <%BoxNavy> pat youre not playing the game like i did so clearly you are bad
[7:07:52] <madtrixr> as long as he didnt go too nuts on the promotion its allllll goood
[7:07:56] <@SoFarFetched> it's not really a waste of money with how much profits he gets guys
[7:07:59] <+CrimKangaroo> gotta roll out. have a great day, all
[7:08:02] <%Broken_Sonex> @televisedrevolting You'd fit well in EA
[7:08:02] <%roscoe_rosaline> Chat doesn't understand the true meaning of BUSINESS.
[7:08:06] <$lotharrio> "We needed to give this baseball player all your money. Out on the street you old bag."
[7:08:12] <madtrixr> just let him have this one
[7:08:13] <$Marcel_BBQ> im gonna do a barnyard employee only run later
[7:08:13] <SGrim> @cherrycottontail don't tell him. His mind goblins will explode.
[7:08:16] <%rumtumtugnutz> clearly you need to upgrade Omelette so she can run a bookstore on her own.
[7:08:18] <%Jekado> also you need high level employees for the shareholders
[7:08:19] <+lazysaiyajin> its 2am but money no sleep
[7:08:26] <+abrupt_abe> dosh
[7:08:28] <+krispen_wa> !MOTIVATED
[7:08:30] <%weissguard> @SoFarFetched Chat seems to be struggling with the concept of BIG STONKS
[7:08:32] <%BoxNavy> he will make the money back ez
[7:08:32] <%Solipsist_Construct> also he hits like a truck even more in shareholder meetings
[7:08:39] <$Marcel_BBQ> he killed it!
[7:08:46] <goosefoiegras> chat have you even been to a business before
[7:08:47] <%Jekado> for a while i was running all 4 properties with just 4 high level people and blasting through the shareholders
[7:08:47] <@SoFarFetched> @weissguard psaBougie psaBougie
[7:08:48] <madtrixr> yeah eventually gonna need him to be big level for shareholders anyways

[7:09:39] <GigaSeifer> that's 5mil to reinvest in that chicken
[7:09:40] <Kiaayo> @ftwsam98 nugget passed away peacefully of old age

[7:09:44] <%BigCoffee> time for add!

[7:09:45] <Blank9> you'll demolish the shareholder meeting
[7:09:45] <%roscoe_rosaline> @SoFarFetched Chat is the reason Pat hasn't opened a business.
[7:09:46] <$lotharrio> Sandwich Man is a good choice to solo Ichiban Confections, if you want to expand elsewhere.

[7:11:11] <%whyskeywolfe> TO DEFEAT ... THE HUNS
[7:11:12] <+Link232> You probably want to put you rlevel 20 guy on your shareholder team by the way

[7:13:55] <Onamar> Tokuda can be upgraded more
[7:13:59] <+Link232> Brillo only has two product upgrades so make sure you have someone on prudct
[7:14:02] <Noogiez> looks good
[7:14:04] <tattleworm> different business types means you can take advantage of trends
[7:14:04] <Lionkevinson> Ye...yeah!!
[7:14:06] <Bustahhwulf> make more soapy ichis LUL
[7:14:06] <fIashman92> You always want the ones towards the bottom
[7:14:10] <%rumtumtugnutz> whores!
[7:14:14] <GigaSeifer> But Brillio already makes double unupgraded
[7:14:14] <%logoth_> This song is now engraved into my brain
[7:14:21] <+Link232> Yeah bottom ones are introduced later so they assume you have more money
[7:14:23] <Kiaayo> more expensive make more money
[7:14:25] <+Link232> So they make more money generally
[7:14:26] <%Jekado> because the new ones open up are at the bottom
[7:14:26] <%rumtumtugnutz> But whores!
[7:14:27] <colzack_> More expensive and make more money
[7:14:29] <+krispen_wa> I like how every other game was hostess clubs, but now this game just goes straight-up brothels
[7:14:30] <%Jekado> those are the better ones usually
[7:14:31] <%TheMattman1313> Base sales volume means larger sales volumes per upgrade
[7:14:33] <%roscoe_rosaline> BELIEVE IN THE HEART OF THE BUSINESS!
[7:14:33] <%JeanGardner99> ones on bottom are newer and more sales volume
[7:14:36] <NeroInfinite> Pinky Rabbit is a scam
[7:14:37] <Onamar> Higher base profits?
[7:14:41] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> clubs makes a shit ton of money here
[7:14:41] <%brachydios777> Remember that we were dealing with counterfeit Chinese money?
[7:14:41] <+Solutha> Sales volume
[7:14:43] <+Link232> It'll be more evident once you get the next loan
[7:14:44] <%MyNameIsRasus> but tokudo starts so low it ends up not mattering
[7:14:48] <%rdark_ksu> sell the crackers to the whores
[7:14:51] <+Grayhammatter> maybe higher sales volume?
[7:14:51] <%penitentpendant> @colzack_ Isn't it Maintenance vs Sales Volume for profit?
[7:14:55] <%bevyrage> don't listen to psa1guy since some of the ones at the bottom are less of a turnout of profits, like the pinky rabbit
[7:14:59] <zipperdude33> I want this song to play at every corporate hq
[7:15:00] <+xeros720> yup
[7:15:03] <+Fusrahdo> Look at price of property to its expense ratio
[7:15:06] <%TheMattman1313> Balance number of upgrades with actual sales volume amount
[7:15:09] <GigaSeifer> Brillio can be upgraded one less time but already makes double, so it's a better choice
[7:15:13] <goosefoiegras> farts
[7:15:22] <+xeros720> sales volume is probably the best indicator
[7:15:26] <xbb1024> whorehouses don't scale, guys. What you going to do, franchise it out?
[7:15:30] <+krispen_wa> BUY PACHINKO, BECOME KONAMI
[7:15:39] <fuji_92> don't listen to chat @patstaresat , you've got a good enough grasp on the game to do it yourself
[7:15:39] <%MyNameIsRasus> Need staff
[7:15:42] <%Merhabi> these whores will subsist on nothing but rice crackers
[7:15:43] <%ClericOfSparda> Buy sex whores! Why? Because avenue Q taught us the only stable investment is PORN!
[7:15:44] <%rumtumtugnutz> YEAH WHORES!
[7:15:45] <%roscoe_rosaline> Big BUSINESS decisions!
[7:15:51] <%promessav2> hamada
[7:15:53] <fIashman92> Wrong, you want someone with high gift
[7:15:54] <%DamnFineCupofStreaming> need more employee's
[7:15:55] <highfivesquash> Hell yes Konami time
[7:16:00] <%brachydios777> I feel Sega is missing the opportunity to make a mobile game out of this mode
[7:16:04] <%Merhabi> Ichiban Big Pimping
[7:16:04] <Lionkevinson> Is that nugget?
[7:16:13] <MasterTonberry23> Youre creating jobs Pat!
[7:16:16] <+dante_must_die_exe> that's Omelette
[7:16:19] <mnightshyamallama2> Pat no
[7:16:26] <GigaSeifer> Omelette might be close to soloing the confections now
[7:16:26] <+Fusrahdo> Should hire
[7:16:37] <wrydiculous> hire
[7:16:38] <%ClericOfSparda> I would play a mobile game based off this for a week
[7:16:41] <Lionkevinson> @dante_must_die_exe Omelette?
[7:16:42] <GigaSeifer> just train the chicken to do it
[7:16:43] <+rickelstiltskin> THAT AINT NUGGET
[7:16:45] <%roscoe_rosaline> Funnel BUSINESS right into the ECONOMY!
[7:16:45] <NeroInfinite> Just upgrade omeltte andhave it run the confectionairy
[7:16:45] <%TheMattman1313> The balanced old lady
[7:16:46] <+xeros720> the old lady can run the confectionary by herself if it's fully upgraded
[7:16:48] <TundraOW> Upgrade the chicken
[7:16:48] <$lotharrio> Put that Karen in there.
[7:16:49] <%penitentpendant> Chicken still too weak
[7:16:52] <%MyNameIsRasus> Max out omelette
[7:16:53] <whimsicallifestyle> CHICKEN RUN BOOKSTORE
[7:16:54] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You need more service for the manager.
[7:16:54] <%BoxNavy> you can level omelette and they can solo it
[7:16:54] <%bevyrage> train omelette and they should be able to run it?
[7:16:55] <+dante_must_die_exe> @Lionkevinson yes that is correct
[7:16:55] <Blank9> it's super easy to make profit and do good with shareholders
[7:16:59] <+taltalheights> We've gone from Excalibur baseball bats to adult babies to Mario Kart to monopoly man. I love this series
[7:17:04] <%Merhabi> you should probably hire some folk no?
[7:17:05] <+TheBrazilianHope> The chicken shall guide you to rank 1
[7:17:07] <GigaSeifer> just train her
[7:17:08] <SharKinStereo> train omelette 4Head
[7:17:08] <TundraOW> Level her up
[7:17:09] <%brachydios777> It’s the Nugget family line
[7:17:10] <$lotharrio> Level her up.
[7:17:12] <%Kitafin> train the lady
[7:17:14] <colzack_> If you promote her maybe
[7:17:15] <Noogiez> up that bitch
[7:17:16] <JaceDarkstar> send in the chicken
[7:17:20] <+dante_must_die_exe> just train omelette
[7:17:21] <%shurtal> Traing
[7:17:25] <$lotharrio> It's a bonus to their stats.
[7:17:25] <+abrupt_abe> Oh god damnit, Ichiban is voiced by Nishki's VA
[7:17:29] <%ClericOfSparda> Pat, you would make that dead Soapland d-bag proud
[7:17:31] <%Too_Much_Nukie> It's percentage based.
[7:17:31] <GigaSeifer> it doesn't from my experience
[7:17:33] <%Solipsist_Construct> i mostly ignored it
[7:17:34] <Blank9> icons matching give a slight stat boost
[7:17:36] <fIashman92> Icon gives bonus stats
[7:17:37] <fuji_92> not that much, imo
[7:17:39] <%MyNameIsRasus> Not a lot
[7:17:39] <ItsZelus> Not that much
[7:17:40] <+dudeenoch> you mean in JP right?
[7:17:40] <%TheMattman1313> Oh the lighter blue in thjeir stat bars
[7:17:42] <%Merhabi> train the old restaurant lady up
[7:17:43] <%Too_Much_Nukie> The higher their stats the higher the bonus they receive.
[7:17:44] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> promote/upgrade her?
[7:17:52] <%BoxNavy> do omelette for the lore
[7:17:53] <GigaSeifer> you could train either to do it, but the chicken will never ask for a raise
[7:17:53] <%penitentpendant> Promote then train
[7:17:55] <%bevyrage> minor stat boost is what i'm seeing
[7:17:55] <%brachydios777> @abrupt_abe That’s why he’s a Karp Dragon
[7:17:56] <tattleworm> you know you want that chicken running that entire shop solo
[7:17:57] <fIashman92> There;s no penalty. Icon gives buffs
[7:17:59] <ftwsam98> dwayne the rock johnson...that is all
[7:18:02] <%roscoe_rosaline> Invest in OLD WOMAN.
[7:18:07] <%ClericOfSparda> Having the same icon as the store gives a small boost to the gift/heart/medal
[7:18:09] <$lotharrio> Silver Ranks get more stats on level.
[7:18:17] <+Pyroclase> Pat are you creating a soul-crushing retail workplace?
[7:18:18] <%Merhabi> Get that old lady upgraded
[7:18:37] <+krispen_wa> GREAT SUCCESS
[7:18:37] <%Merhabi> YEAH
[7:18:39] <%BoxNavy> sick
[7:18:41] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> nice
[7:18:41] <+krispen_wa> I'm getting gacha flashbacks
[7:18:41] <GManx0> Crunch is only acceptable in Ichiban Confections
[7:18:42] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah that's how I used her lol
[7:18:44] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah this is kind of a nightmare
[7:18:44] <%roscoe_rosaline> Rebuild her to be the perfect BUSINESS PERSON
[7:18:44] <%Merhabi> This hole was made for her!
[7:18:46] <ftwsam98> the chicken runs the store alone lmao
[7:18:47] <+TheBrazilianHope> This hole was made for me
[7:18:48] <$lotharrio> And if SHE gives you guff about leaving, you can replace her easily.
[7:18:51] <%DakotaMacDoodle> This hle was made for me!
[7:18:52] <a_mad_dragon> drr drr drr
[7:18:54] <GigaSeifer> if you train him too, yeah
[7:18:57] <%Merhabi> YEYEYE

[7:18:59] <%BoxNavy> OH SHIT
[7:19:00] <%Kitafin> train
[7:19:01] <Lionkevinson> Make sure the employees make a tiktok video
[7:19:05] <%TheMattman1313> Not after volume upgrades
[7:19:07] <%Merhabi> We run a lean labor schedule in this bookstore
[7:19:09] <ftwsam98> youre actually doing it
[7:19:10] <%rumtumtugnutz> train the nugget
[7:19:12] <GigaSeifer> once people are at 30, you can basically solo-staff max-upgraded properties until the final tier
[7:19:13] <ammobasket> can this cat count change?!?
[7:19:16] <+xeros720> need more employees
[7:19:20] <%bevyrage> you could actually swap out the leader with one of the other guys
[7:19:20] <fIashman92> Brillow needs a leader with high gift
[7:19:24] <%brachydios777> We went from sweat shop to small business in like an hour
[7:19:25] <+VeryCaffeinatedCat> he wont be able to run that place because you need a manager with product
[7:19:47] <zipperdude33> Nugget is going to commit some serious tax fraud
[7:19:49] <%DakotaMacDoodle> Yeah, get them to dance for more hours @PatStaresAt
[7:20:02] <GigaSeifer> just train the chicken
[7:20:06] <extradopeness> love this music
[7:20:07] <dan_g_v> dance for black friday?
[7:20:13] <%Merhabi> We went from selling rice crackers to pimping out an entire building of women in an hour
[7:20:15] <$lotharrio> He can get away with one extra hire that has okay product stat.
[7:20:24] <%BoxNavy> 🐓 b'gawk!
[7:20:31] <Lionkevinson> Always dance for black friday
[7:20:32] <+zeraux_> i can see the addiction coursing thru pats veins can you ?
[7:20:38] <%roscoe_rosaline> Tip: The secret to worthwhile investments is NANOBUSINESS
[7:20:43] <$lotharrio> Higher tier ranked employees get more stats on level up.
[7:20:45] <%stabbityrabbit> "At Ichiban Senbai we run a tight ship. We have six employees over four establishments. One of which is a chicken. Why should we hire you?" - Ichiban, Probably
[7:20:47] <%Merhabi> Increase the service of my prostitutes
[7:20:55] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You know it's a Yakuza game when you hear the streamer yell "Nugget you need more service god damn it!"
[7:20:58] <%brachydios777> Pat doing grinding on stream

[7:26:42] <televisedrevolting> That's how Yakuza works
[7:26:43] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You'll reach a point where you have so much money coming in you might as well invest in every opportunity anyway just to see.
[7:26:43] <+krispen_wa> That's how Yakuza works
[7:26:44] <$lotharrio> You need someone with good Service in there.
[7:26:50] <JaceDarkstar> he looks good tho
[7:26:51] <%brachydios777> That’s how Yakuza works
[7:26:51] <%ShinobiPhoenix> in real life, tthat would be infuriating
[7:26:54] <+abrupt_abe> We need a union

[7:27:22] <%DamnFineCupofStreaming> gonna have this 3million yen bookstore run solo by a chicken - BIG BUSINESS'
[7:27:25] <%Eaglestrike117> He's maxed, you can upgrade and train him for it
[7:27:36] <GigaSeifer> remember Pat, you haven't won if you have more employees than businesses
[7:27:44] <%BoxNavy> it really is just getting the bars in the blue from the looks of it
[7:27:48] <+lazysaiyajin> LUL

[7:31:34] <tsuchi7> they need a little more motivation
[7:31:35] <%ShinobiPhoenix> so what does Mr Brillo sell?
[7:31:43] <Noogiez> nugget is the only one i trust
[7:31:47] <televisedrevolting> Net Worth ain't great.

[7:32:01] <%penitentpendant> It's nice promoting also heals them
[7:32:02] <dalishprince> when the chicken gets a promotion before you

[7:33:06] <%TheMattman1313> Upgrade volume and put him as leader
[7:33:06] <+tigerfang86> gotta NAB THAT MAJIMA at some point
[7:33:10] <Noogiez> heal?
[7:33:10] <TundraOW> Are you gonna make your target in time?
[7:33:11] <%brachydios777> Is that Kiryu!?
[7:33:17] <GigaSeifer> you'd have to pay him every business session, so it's not saving anything to get him now
[7:33:21] <dan_g_v> are there more ads?
[7:33:24] <+krispen_wa> He's gonna make that target easily
[7:33:26] <%DianaTheAscian> does this whole system go away if u ever enter the red?
[7:33:31] <xbb1024> Kiryu is one of the DLC
[7:33:32] <%Too_Much_Nukie> There are 2 ads.
[7:33:37] <%BoxNavy> mada mada dame da
[7:33:40] <%Too_Much_Nukie> The ad changes at one point in the management's story.
[7:33:41] <+taltalheights> Pay the chicken in exposure
[7:33:45] <%roscoe_rosaline> The real BUSINESS was the profits we made along the way!

[7:34:19] <televisedrevolting> Plus the meetings boost your rating like CRAZY
[7:34:20] <xbb1024> But you could always be crushing it faster...
[7:34:22] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You kind of have to fuck it up.
[7:34:23] <%BoxNavy> you have to heal your mans
[7:34:24] <GigaSeifer> I never came anywhere close to running out of periods and I didn't even buy new properties for a while
[7:34:24] <%Jekado> like the first shareholder is confusing
[7:34:25] <%roscoe_rosaline> Chat doesn't understand BUSINESS numbers.

[7:34:27] <robotman37> For some reason I want daigo to fuck up your reports if you hire him
[7:34:30] <Gameaholic42> What would be the penalty if you didn't make it?

[7:34:50] <%ShinobiPhoenix> doesn't speak human, is one of your best employees
[7:34:52] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Do you think Kiryu would recognize Nugget Jr if he met her?
[7:34:53] <%shurtal> Omlette, herself
[7:34:54] <ghostkingwho> still no commercial?
[7:34:55] <+dante_must_die_exe> Omlette
[7:34:56] <CrazyMedicine> the grandma team is lacking power
[7:34:57] <$lotharrio> Someone cheap or big power.
[7:35:01] <madtrixr> i really want to know the penalty for not meeting nick's goals, i was never in any danger of hitting it
[7:35:12] <%brachydios777> Omelette belongs to a strong family line
[7:35:15] <+Grayhammatter> that's some big power
[7:35:18] <%roscoe_rosaline> Chat: Nooo, you can't invest like that! Pat: Haha, profits go brrrrrrr
[7:35:21] <%YakumoYomi> Round 1. FIGHT!
[7:35:22] <%ShinobiPhoenix> *SPEAK ENGLISH TO WORK IN AMERICA* (Omelette is a chicken)

[7:38:23] <goosefoiegras> sandwichman yamagi is a kojima character
[7:38:27] <%brachydios777> This is funnier than Kiryu running a business considering how dumb Ichiban can be
[7:38:35] <melonsouda> Sandwichman failed us
[7:38:38] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @BoxNavy ok, that's cool. so most all the Yakuza's have some business management minigame that is entirely too involved

[7:43:32] <JaceDarkstar> do it pat. get the majama
[7:43:35] <GigaSeifer> using the SSRs to cheat doesn't actually make it go any faster, it just eliminates the micromanaging headache
[7:43:36] <xbb1024> Maybe you'd be 50 after the next meeting
[7:43:39] <%zajoestar> WE INSIST
[7:43:41] <Gameaholic42> No but the past hour was

[7:44:05] <ExtraToastyCheezit> We’re still fighting the homelees
[7:44:05] <$lotharrio> Pat, save the cheats for the final tier.
[7:44:07] <ammobasket> For Majima to be Everywhere, you must pay your dues by hiring him
[7:44:11] <+taltalheights> Just use Majima offscreen to tease us
[7:44:12] <SharKinStereo> mmmmaaaAAAAAAAjima

[7:46:37] <mattynezz> He's level 1
[7:46:39] <%roscoe_rosaline> Your BUSINESS was strong enough without him! It was all for nothing!
[7:46:39] <%Eaglestrike117> Invest in that level 6 guy dude
[7:46:44] <%brachydios777> Would have Troy Baker been a good choice for Majima too?
[7:46:45] <%the22cstomp> level majima
[7:46:52] <fuji_92> nip, just lvl the dude or majima
[7:46:52] <mattynezz> Level Majima
[7:46:54] <$lotharrio> Majima needs to work under a sleepy old man.
[7:47:02] <fIashman92> Level up the nerd

[7:47:07] <+zeraux_> youve been betrayed pat

[7:47:13] <akitanito> cycle everyone
[7:47:16] <mattynezz> You were VERY close
[7:47:27] <melonsouda> Makes sense, Majima's never HAD much of a product, but his serivce has always been outstanding
[7:47:27] <fIashman92> Just level the nerd
[7:47:30] <+TDAWS_MP132> so level up hiro when you get the chance
[7:47:33] <%YakumoYomi> His product did go up, didn't it? It looked like a tiny sliver more than before
[7:47:35] <Saltmeisterr> just a small cheat
[7:47:36] <+TDAWS_MP132> for big product
[7:47:36] <NeroInfinite> sandwhich man product?
[7:47:38] <%roscoe_rosaline> You listened to chat, instead of the heart of the BUSINESS. Now the BUSINESS will take what it is owed.
[7:47:39] <%rdark_ksu> i wanna see another of those ads
[7:47:39] <%Eaglestrike117> you can level the level 6 glasses guy to get the production you need i think
[7:47:46] <%BoxNavy> i wanna hear kiryu in english so bad
[7:47:47] <%TheMattman1313> I wonder if that bar to the right of the sales volume indicates sales growth over time
[7:47:48] <akitanito> majima would do better in the pink business
[7:47:50] <$Afterman_> lol he did buy him
[7:47:50] <%Jekado> I would recomend putting majima on your shareholder team
[7:47:51] <GigaSeifer> yeah, that's wrong
[7:47:52] <+taltalheights> Please tell me Majima comes to shareholder meeting slowly emerging from a garbage can
[7:47:54] <fIashman92> Majima as leader and leveled nerd
[7:47:54] <RumonGray> It's too late, the goblins have him now.
[7:47:58] <mattynezz> The cost to level him to 5 is basically nothing, just try it
[7:47:58] <+snurtlord> level up buff sakurai and put him in the second slot pat
[7:48:00] <%brachydios777> Who does chat think a good VA for Majima should also be?
[7:48:02] <fuji_92> use majima as leader, and lvl the nerd
[7:48:03] <huskarl_zap> english Kiryu is master chief
[7:48:08] <+TDAWS_MP132> majima lead and then level hiro for product

[7:57:54] <akitanito> you forgot to heal
[7:57:55] <GigaSeifer> you'll be replacing all the non-Ichiban Confection business after the shareholder meetings, so just hold off for now

[7:58:23] <fuji_92> * the dude
[7:58:27] <GigaSeifer> Basically none
[7:58:27] <%Jekado> All the good late game ones are just amusement locations its annoying since you get very few employees
[7:58:27] <colzack_> Yes
[7:58:28] <madtrixr> yes
[7:58:28] <Zarkith> Some yeah
[7:58:28] <+Link232> You'll get 50/50 chance I think
[7:58:28] <%hahaha1171> yes
[7:58:31] <akitanito> doubt it
[7:58:31] <tsuchi7> some are
[7:58:31] <%coreyyotto> I had ONE work out
[7:58:32] <Maleicus> yeah some
[7:58:32] <%bevyrage> none of them are real
[7:58:33] <huskarl_zap> I don't do N E G A T I V I T Y
[7:58:34] <madtrixr> you can get returns
[7:58:35] <@SSaryn> There are but that's easily a joke.
[7:58:35] <%Jekado> they rarely pay off
[7:58:36] <%BoxNavy> no :)
[7:58:36] <%roscoe_rosaline> False BUSINESS
[7:58:37] <%furiousfurioso> rarely
[7:58:37] <$lotharrio> I've gotten wins on them. Low probability, though/.
[7:58:38] <+Link232> I've only seen up to 50/50 at least
[7:58:38] <melonsouda> It's probably a gamble
[7:58:39] <NeroInfinite> some are
[7:58:39] <fuji_92> some i think
[7:58:42] <huskarl_zap> you dont need any of it
[7:58:44] <%Deano8817> Yes but rary
[7:58:45] <madtrixr> but a lot of the time they are no good
[7:58:46] <%NatK94> Investments are very hit or miss
[7:58:46] <GigaSeifer> In the entire time it took form start to finish, I took them all and had ONE payout
[7:58:49] <%Jekado> its almost never worth the risk
[7:58:56] <tsuchi7> HEEEEEEAL
[7:58:57] <%Jekado> SO DO I
[7:58:58] <%TheMattman1313> RT
