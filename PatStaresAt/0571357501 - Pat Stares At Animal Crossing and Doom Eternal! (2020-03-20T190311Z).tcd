[0:18:26] <%Ranryu692> only in some places
[0:18:27] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> depends
[0:18:27] <%MajorCrasher> WRONG
[0:18:28] <%brickwall35> that's super wrong
[0:18:29] <katocrimson> Depends on the country
[0:18:29] <%StaceMcGate> they are still debating that
[0:18:30] <indig0bird> Wait, is that the actual Odd1Out?
[0:18:30] <+thefancywig> not like... right now, but it's gonna get worse
[0:18:30] <+skylerpilot> @PatStaresAt I work for one of my local school districts, the latest we can go due for make up days is June 19th. also this is a national emergency mandated shut down so they aren't applicable for make up days
[0:18:30] <iosephe> It depends on the state
[0:18:32] <+cinder_chan> I called my realtor and they are still expecting rent on the 1st
[0:18:33] <+AMagicalFlute> It goes by state
[0:18:34] <%GinAndRoses> depends on where you live
[0:18:34] <%spiritofmojave> Can you get evicted? hope not if this is long term
[0:18:34] <+thefancywig> but that's just in some places
[0:18:35] <%Battedgroundhog> i think it depends on the state
[0:18:35] <deathsmions1> yeah america is
[0:18:35] <marvel877> PEOPLE STILL GETTING EVICTED BECAUSE LANDLORDS ARE ASSHOLES
[0:18:35] <tiaramaki> I think it depends

[0:18:37] <+tuchpi> ONE GUY email LUL
[0:18:37] <EternalFenix42> we had to have legislation pass to make that happen, Pat
[0:18:37] <%shadylawyerman> Federally yes, state depends

[0:18:39] <thefinalrumbling> pat, just a warning you'll run out of shit to do after about 2 hours on the first day. you can still time travel by changing the date on your switch tho. day 2 has a bunch of stuff to do.
[0:18:39] <%SoFarFetched> depends on the state yeah

[1:19:14] <%necrocannibal2> READING WATER
[1:19:15] <trianglehat> stroke
[1:19:15] <%TIME_PUNCHER> did you do good pee
[1:19:16] <Sol_Install> Nice pat
[1:19:19] <TwinBat> read that h20 my dude
[1:19:20] <+zafooru> What happens when you read too much water??
[1:19:20] <Edible_Enthusiasm> Sure does.
[1:19:21] <Sol_Install> Amazing pat
[1:19:23] <%2DSuperiority> read water and drink books
[1:19:23] <j0ustar> Pat reading water ripples for the future
[1:19:24] <Edible_Enthusiasm> but its HEALTHY
[1:19:24] <%necrocannibal2> it's healthy tho
[1:19:24] <CrypticMochi> I miss the fanfic streams
[1:19:25] <%GarbageQueenEllie> 8 ounces 8 glasses 8 days a week
[1:19:27] <cureneckbeard> I don't think you actually have to drink that much water
[1:19:27] <ThalosTheSoviet> drink water or die
[1:19:31] <bleugh> read that water
[1:19:31] <+Jp3g95> 8 days a week yes
[1:19:31] <RadicalWeegee> Its keeps ya clean tho
[1:19:31] <%SoFarFetched> yeah I've been drinking a lot more water these days
[1:19:31] <%BallerSwagBro9k> OLD MAN PAT
[1:19:32] <%nofestu2> but it's also good
[1:19:32] <%starotter70> Just chug it all in one go
[1:19:32] <Sol_Install> reading water like you can see the future
[1:19:32] <Rhinoprotoss> Fuck you I love my ultra water
[1:19:33] <+bellicoseweeb> That really isn't a lot
[1:19:33] <terribleusername> get a catheter
[1:19:34] <%Aracon_> but water tastes good
[1:19:34] <%king_wragles> @PatStaresAt it's consuming up to 8 glasses worth. Doesn't have to be drinking exactly. Eat grapes n shit
[1:19:34] <%BigCoffee> drink water or die
[1:19:34] <%arcaderabbit48> Flush your system
[1:19:36] <SomersaultJustice> just drink your pee. recycle
[1:19:36] <+zafooru> But pat, peeing gets rid of the poison in your body faster
[1:19:37] <Sundaysmiles01> I pee like three times a day...
[1:19:38] <+mirvyr> i've just made it my hobby, I drink about a gallon a day
[1:19:39] <bigunclebungus> drink a garbage bag of water per day
[1:19:40] <+guyalex> your body will get used to it
[1:19:41] <+bustawof> I know
[1:19:41] <%BallerSwagBro9k> DEW IT
[1:19:43] <cureneckbeard> Just do like the other streamers and wear a stream diaper
[1:19:43] <a_mad_dragon> get a catheter Kappa
[1:19:44] <$RealThiele> i recommend The Dresden Files books if you are reading
[1:19:44] <%GarbageQueenEllie> None of us do, Pat, but water good
[1:19:45] <%Skelegroove> There is no evidence you need 8 glasses a day
[1:19:45] <Edible_Enthusiasm> Do you want a CATHETER or DIAPERS
[1:19:46] <ShineTheDiamond> Hydration is a good habit to have
[1:19:47] <CeeDee__> Were you actually reading the water, or were you just listening to water
[1:19:47] <$FluffiTamamo> At least it’s not Dasani
[1:19:48] <+guyalex> then youll pee a bit less
[1:19:48] <%CJett92> Embrace the Dry World
[1:19:48] <%Hobojo153> Look at the table
[1:19:49] <zk_nails> then just don't 4head
[1:19:50] <%taku_toots> Become a skeleton its the best
[1:19:51] <+NitronStreams> do the crafting you coward
[1:19:54] <%TIME_PUNCHER> just hold it in
[1:19:55] <$NoctisxMog> i find tea more hydrating
[1:19:56] <tusk102> reminds you of your disgusting human body, eh? @PatStaresAt
[1:19:57] <prophetjo> that's called dehydration
[1:19:59] <alxnotorious> i would just drink until pee is clear
[1:20:04] <Ultra_Pancake> @PatStaresAt Just make your body more efficient and use %100 of what you take in.
[1:20:09] <%arcaderabbit48> Also doesnt 8 cups mean literally 8 cups? Like 8 times 16 ounces?
[1:20:10] <Yummy_Nukes> @patstaresat you could try sweating the water out like the hunter-gatherers did
[1:20:13] <+projectmanatees> yes yes nazamu
[1:20:18] <CrypticMochi> I don’t have to pee as much with tea
[1:20:19] <+Jp3g95> why did it transition
[1:20:21] <%Hobojo153> Teach us how to Minecraft papa Nook
[1:20:22] <auhsojnala> Gon be real, didn't expect to see Pat streaming this when I opened Twitch

[1:21:55] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Not sure what to think of Tom. On the one hand, he's basically trying to be Castro. On the other hand, he's super helpful and lenient about debts.

[1:34:35] <$joylent_blue> SeemsGood
[1:34:35] <%TIME_PUNCHER> @Jp3g95 Fukken Uber Death Party
[1:34:35] <tusk102> @PatStaresAt make boots stupid
[1:34:37] <%Laecerelius> Do you say that whenever you get a boot when Warframe fishing, Pat?
[1:34:38] <+Jp3g95> boot shaped fish
[1:34:39] <%necrocannibal2> AND ACT LIKE A FISH
[1:34:39] <mobiusnightshade> 'Whatever this is, it's gotta weigh as much as twenty boots!'
[1:34:40] <%mornerboi> "This boot is not a fish." Truly a king outdoorsman, Pat.
[1:34:40] <krabthecrab> So this is just Nintendo Farmville, right?
[1:34:41] <%Hobojo153> You can sometimes get garbage
[1:34:42] <%doc_ock_rokc> You have to complete paige's hookerboots
[1:34:45] <%nofestu2> boot fish
[1:34:48] <Shonen_hero> catch more boot
[1:34:48] <katocrimson> let's wear these river trash boots
[1:34:49] <chambatron> Pat Honest question. Do you actually like this game?
[1:34:51] <elspiceweasel> Boots can be fish if they try hard enough!
[1:34:52] <%arcaderabbit48> So what are the fish for?
[1:34:52] <RavenHellkite> just like yakuza shadow fish
[1:34:53] <jdwhalen> My guy you just convinced a boot to wiggle, and bite your bait @PatStaresAt
[1:34:58] <%tactician0> because they don't realize it themselves
[1:35:01] <%Hobojo153> They each have a size that's why
[1:35:02] <%Kataguro> A Sand Dollar isn't a fish
[1:35:04] <tusk102> @PatStaresAt take the fish to the museum also
[1:35:05] <+Jp3g95> You can catch bugs too
[1:35:06] <SummonerMagno> you can place fishes in tent

[2:00:38] <Shonen_hero> better watch out for the bag worm in your bagged milk

[2:07:11] <%damienlunas> I used to trample the flowers my sister planted and then she would try to strangle me. Good times.
[2:07:11] <%Frost_Quill> @Zutrax He seems to like it and Pat doesn't usually bullshit his dislike of games.

[2:44:11] <$rooooooooooot> uh like 7?
[2:44:11] <pileoftrees> it depends on the season
[2:44:12] <%코코꾸라> Midnight is midnight
[2:44:13] <bigunclebungus> eastern
[2:44:13] <Yadogari> Night time
[2:44:13] <Iamdenril> your midnight
[2:44:13] <%SoFarFetched> ACtual night time
[2:44:14] <Sundaysmiles01> literally midnight
[2:44:16] <%doc_ock_rokc> 7-8
[2:44:17] <%QuadraticGravity> when the sun is down?
[2:44:17] <%NuclearLawlocausto> NIGHT TIME IS NIGHT TIME
[2:44:17] <TechDragon_Z> Real time
[2:44:18] <%mostly_simple> IRL time
[2:44:19] <+cinder_chan> I thought it was night when it was night in your timezone
[2:44:22] <%honeyman18> about yours, like 6am and 6pm
[2:44:23] <rubbishbinge> Real time
[2:44:23] <Thirtine> its 1 to 1
[2:44:24] <TheIncoherentGamer> @PatStaresAt Its pretty close to your time
[2:44:24] <%machshop> no midnight is midnight
[2:44:25] <%CJett92> Its based on your Switch clock
[2:44:25] <cherpii> Should matchup with your time setting
[2:44:26] <Daniel_Is_I> I think it's the system clock?
[2:44:27] <+cinder_chan> like full 24 hour days
[2:44:27] <$Trenr> it gets dark around 6-8
[2:44:28] <%PaladinDupre> It's sync'd to the clock on your switch
[2:44:28] <+Psycosis> real time
[2:44:29] <pileoftrees> it's time zone sensitive!!
[2:44:30] <+xGreenflame> Time is 1:1
[2:44:31] <+linSP> I can’t believe pat got the hot bird
[2:44:33] <$Trenr> but midnight is midnight
[2:44:36] <%Jekado> it uses your internal clock for everything
[2:44:37] <Ultra_Pancake> Animal crossing is real time.
[2:44:37] <$floralkami> actual time. that's why the time synced to your time in-game
[2:44:38] <TechDragon_Z> System clock
[2:44:38] <Will_The_Soulless> its literally your time zone
[2:44:38] <%valkuma> its hour by hour. the darkness isa bout 7PM
[2:44:39] <Lutre> depends if your island is northern or southern hemisphere
[2:44:41] <%SoFarFetched> yeah
[2:44:41] <bearking05> yeah
[2:44:42] <%machshop> yeh
[2:44:43] <%SoFarFetched> pretty much
[2:44:43] <+skylerpilot> its 1 to 1 with your console time
[2:44:43] <Will_The_Soulless> welllll
[2:44:43] <RavenHellkite> yup
[2:44:44] <pileoftrees> more or less yeah
[2:44:45] <%mornerboi> pat time scaling is 1:1
[2:44:45] <Shadope342> oui
[2:44:45] <%Jekado> more or less
[2:44:45] <Sundaysmiles01> yep
[2:44:45] <%thegreenbenis> YES
[2:44:46] <Lutre> yeah
[2:44:46] <SomeOtherNeb> yeh
[2:44:46] <Will_The_Soulless> kinda
[2:44:46] <%코코꾸라> yeah
[2:44:47] <bombermato> pretty much
[2:44:47] <+CriticalMassShow> It uses your system clock
[2:44:47] <numbus_26> pretty much, yeah
[2:44:47] <%mostly_simple> ye
[2:44:48] <soraabora> yeah
[2:44:48] <fairore> yeah
[2:44:48] <%doc_ock_rokc> More or less yes
[2:44:49] <RadicalWeegee> more or less yee
[2:44:49] <%QuestionableRadioactivity> Yup
[2:44:50] <Ultra_Pancake> Yes,
[2:44:50] <%medusasghost> yeah
[2:44:50] <+xGreenflame> pretty much
[2:44:52] <%Jekado> it might not be super accurate
[2:44:53] <$Trenr> the hours in AC are real time so
[2:44:53] <worldbrand> within an hour or two probably
[2:44:54] <TheIncoherentGamer> @PatStaresAt more or less give or take a hour
[2:44:55] <+Sheep_thrill> depends on how far north or south you are i guess
[2:44:58] <FrankysDream> IF YOU DIE IN THE GAME YOU DIE FOR REAL!
[2:45:01] <+linSP> aww shit
[2:45:03] <+skylerpilot> it reads your console clock
[2:45:09] <MassConnect> remember when rogue squadron did time scaleing?
[2:45:15] <+ericaabg> thats why it asked for your hemisphere so your seasons/time would be consistent w your own
[2:45:15] <maxpasta> The game came out last night how could anyone know that @patstaresat
[2:45:15] <Malisin_Murder> Yes
[2:45:21] <%mostly_simple> real time hours sounds glacial
[2:45:31] <worldbrand> and some people cheat
[2:45:32] <sexdrugsvideogames> @MassConnect no, really?
[2:45:32] <$rooooooooooot> most shit is consistent between the series
[2:45:32] <$Trenr> based on past AC games
[2:45:33] <%bread_assassin> That advise implies Pat has windows he can look outside off to see how bright it is.
[2:45:33] <EternalFenix42> good thing these phones don't need charging at all
[2:45:33] <Thirtine> AC is always real time
[2:45:35] <bearking05> its been in the games for awhile
[2:45:37] <SomeOtherNeb> also the game has been out for 20+ hours in Europe
[2:45:39] <%Valdorick> Also, Reveiw copies tested it
[2:45:40] <+NitronStreams> pretty sure he knows its real time hes asking about the sun rise and set
[2:45:40] <%angel949> leaks
[2:45:41] <$floralkami> @maxpasta AC doesn't change much, lol
[2:45:43] <pileoftrees> also when you mentioned the island being small, when blathers moves in you gain access to another 30% of your island
[2:45:47] <emeraldskrull> psaCanada psaCanada psaCanada
[2:45:47] <+TheAux> also you can change your in game time whenever yo want
[2:45:51] <cherpii> Ac has been real time since like always. it was a PS 2? era game i think
[2:45:52] <Ultra_Pancake> Animal Crossing has always used real time.
[2:45:53] <%YakumoYomi> And soooo many weeds
[2:45:55] <Daniel_Is_I> Not a lot of beach for a fucking island
[2:45:56] <%Laecerelius> when can Pat learn how to make jump stick?
[2:45:56] <+Jp3g95> Precious beech
[2:45:59] <$OranHexthief> also reviewers have had it for as much as 3 weeks in some cases
[2:45:59] <+acexclover> got to much to worry about on ffxiv
[2:46:00] <%thegreenbenis> YOU'LL GET MORE ISLAND SOON.
[2:46:01] <$Caped_Eggy> Is this all the place you can go on this island?
[2:46:01] <$floralkami> @maxpasta this is the 4th game in the series, iirc
[2:46:05] <morningmoondude> I think I might get this game now
[2:46:06] <TheIncoherentGamer> @PatStaresAt Once you get the museum you'll get to open up your'll whole Island

[3:11:28] <%MayorRev> Pat you're gonna be super relieved when your house is built
[3:11:28] <yeeyeyee> Will every stream have a 1 hour animal crossing session before the main game now so pat can do his dailies

[3:12:00] <%Frost_Quill> @hntronium Not sure, it might just be his mind goblins.
[3:12:01] <%Deano8817> @hntronium he likes animal crossing and it scares him

[3:12:15] <MassConnect> @pat be sure to play animal crossing during podcast to get podcast-time-only content
[3:12:16] <$floralkami> @patstaresat you could TOTALLY play AC before each stream while you read subs and donos
[3:12:17] <Dragon_Batman> LUL
[3:12:20] <%honeyman18> ideal sessions for stuff are about 30 minutes daily btw
[3:12:25] <%J_Papa> Can he write on the white board?
[3:12:25] <andrei11dr> He ded it
[3:12:30] <%realm_forge> Make sure to dig a latrine and don’t wipe with poison oak!
[3:12:30] <CursedNobleman> "Fking seashells. AWW YEAH!" LUL
[3:12:31] <heartlesshealer> oh look, MORE WEEDS
[3:12:34] <%Frost_Quill> @PatStaresAt I can't tell if you like this game or if it's just your mind goblins.

[3:12:57] <Lutre> this game IS mind goblins
[3:12:57] <%LouieRouie> The answer is yes
[3:12:58] <Shonen_hero> if the glove fits it fits
[3:13:07] <yeeyeyee> Serious suggestion
[3:13:08] <Saltmeisterr> answer is both

[3:13:13] <%thegreenbenis> Do it.
[3:13:13] <%Frost_Quill> That is legitimately a good amount of time to play.
[3:13:14] <%CJett92> Are those dailies, or just bonus quests?
[3:13:14] <+NitronStreams> PEACH

[3:13:51] <Malisin_Murder> WHO'S TALKING
[3:13:52] <%ToxInjection> I thought it'd be her jam

[3:14:10] <%doc_ock_rokc> GET IT AWAY FROM HER
[3:14:10] <+NitronStreams> DO IT PAIGE
[3:14:10] <bombermato> not a one
[3:14:12] <nukle0nik> she might enjoy it but she'll have to play on your shit island if she uses the same switch as you
[3:14:12] <%ToxInjection> Y'all are missing out on some PEAK relaxation
[3:14:13] <%redrins> not even a chicken
[3:14:13] <%MayorRev> Paige would enjoy!
[3:14:14] <%cvp5127> does she like to decorate?

[3:16:01] <%SoFarFetched> So one level LUL
[3:16:02] <Dastardry> Sitting here wanting to play some more AC while also watching the stream then realizing that the Switch can be handheld

[3:16:29] <Shishi1205> no
[3:16:29] <worldbrand> not really
[3:16:30] <$floralkami> no
[3:16:30] <cherpii> No???
[3:16:30] <%YakumoYomi> Nope
[3:16:31] <bombermato> kinda
[3:16:32] <%CJett92> Kinda ya, not really
[3:16:32] <%shadow1man9> Nope
[3:16:32] <%BigCoffee> no
[3:16:32] <Will_The_Soulless> kinda
[3:16:33] <+Doomtastic> night fish and bugs
[3:16:34] <+JavaManJoJo> there's a soft cap
[3:16:34] <+ZoltanBMagnus> nope
[3:16:34] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> slows but not ends
[3:16:34] <Will_The_Soulless> the beginning
[3:16:35] <%Meekest> No?
[3:16:36] <%thegreenbenis> JUST NEED TO WAIT A WHILE
[3:16:36] <Darren716> No bugs and fish respawn
[3:16:37] <lloyddboy> WEED AND SEED -> RIP AND TEAR
[3:16:37] <Shardlab> no
[3:16:37] <rubbishbinge> Plague doing doom now
[3:16:37] <cherpii> No
[3:16:38] <+silvery_cricket> Animal Crossing is infinite
[3:16:38] <Ipsenscastle> more fun than I thought!
[3:16:38] <+SadSadSenpai> Bugs and fish infinite
[3:16:38] <Will_The_Soulless> it starts a bit slow
[3:16:38] <LilacsandFreedom> bugs and fish always respawn
[3:16:38] <+Doomtastic> time specific things
[3:16:39] <MSpellBringer> fish and bugs respawn
[3:16:40] <RavenHellkite> bugs and fish are always there
[3:16:41] <%Shady_Squid> again, you can just move the clock forward
[3:16:41] <+icekept> Tell her th3 name of island
[3:16:41] <Monkeyweed21> Keep cleaning the earth Pat
[3:16:41] <fairore> no
[3:16:42] <%honeyman18> fruit takes 2 days to come back
[3:16:42] <+Kise77> @PatStaresAt you buy tickets with miles to go to new small islands
[3:16:42] <%thegreenbenis> WAIT A WHILE
[3:16:43] <%BallerSwagBro9k> YUP
[3:16:44] <+Zutrax> Animal Crossing is meant to be a supplemental game, not a main game.
[3:16:45] <+R_BChe> it starts slow
[3:16:46] <+MisterRockett> You run out of fruit and stones but not bugs and fish.
[3:16:47] <+linSP> Time to Rip that ass
[3:16:47] <heartlesshealer> Time is your cap
[3:16:48] <+emperri> this cap is soft and fuzzy
[3:16:48] <+Kise77> @PatStaresAt they have resources
[3:16:48] <saiyan24675> Rip and Tear
[3:16:49] <Shadope342> seems limited cause at the start
[3:16:50] <CassyASG> we4ll no it will open up the more time passes
[3:16:50] <%mornerboi> and night fish
[3:16:50] <%Frost_Quill> Kind of. You can keep catching stuff but it's a limited selection based on time of day and time of year.
[3:16:50] <Will_The_Soulless> slow to begin
[3:16:51] <+MisterRockett> You can fish all day.
[3:16:51] <%trustycoyote> Soft cap is more correct
[3:16:54] <ShichiNoBushi> There's some stuff that resets per day, but most of everything never runs out.
[3:16:56] <kylejefferies> SOFT CAP = Nothing New, same stuff.
[3:16:56] <tusk102> animal crossing is a game you play between other games tbh
[3:16:56] <RadicalWeegee> Rare nifght bugs that cost alot
[3:16:58] <$FluffiTamamo> Cross and chill, rip and tear.
[3:16:59] <CursedNobleman> its like pokemon, some at times of day
[3:17:01] <nukle0nik> CHILI
[3:17:02] <+ianabstract> There are diminishing returns
[3:17:02] <soraabora> like a soft cap kinda
[3:17:03] <worldbrand> don't died
[3:17:03] <%BoomerUnchained> psaPat
[3:17:03] <heartlesshealer> yay food
[3:17:04] <+MuteDanger> @patstaresat I named my island Bukkakia and I'm proud of it
[3:17:05] <+icekept> Tell paige island name
[3:17:06] <%honeyman18> woo
[3:17:08] <%optimasmaximas> no
[3:17:08] <%realm_forge> My day is usually done when I run out of bugs
[3:17:09] <%CJett92> <3
[3:17:09] <+SadSadSenpai> Bye bye!
[3:17:11] <RyanTheRecluse> !uptime
[3:17:12] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 17m.
[3:17:12] <%optimasmaximas> it does not work for me
[3:17:12] <%zombie_goasts> PAT WAS NEVER SEEN AGAIN
[3:17:13] <Will_The_Soulless> you can do tours using nook miles to visit random islands you can destroy without concequence
[3:17:14] <%Frost_Quill> Alright time to play my own copy.
[3:17:19] <saiyan24675> Let’s hope those Raccoons don’t break people knee caps if the don’t pay back their debts
[3:17:24] <%Ixiah> is this the same chili from last week ? Oo
[3:17:24] <andrei11dr> Shit im one more key from getting the Doom 64 gun
[3:17:25] <%zombie_goasts> Pat died on the way back to his home planet
[3:17:36] <%Frost_Quill> So is Pat playing Doom next?
[3:17:38] <%tactician0> there is not enough to do in AC
[3:17:40] <Redblood801> I can't believe Pat's dead
[3:17:50] <%trustycoyote> @Frost_Quill Yes
[3:17:59] <andrei11dr> I hope its worth it
[3:18:01] <$floralkami> @saiyan24675 there's no deadline, so no (but what if...)
[3:18:05] <%arcaderabbit48> I feel like I understand even less about Animal Crossing than when we started, but I'm glad Pat seemed to enjoy himself.
[3:18:20] <%YakumoYomi> Pat must WISE FWOM HIS GWAVE, and then we'll be ready to rip and tear some more in Doom
[3:18:20] <%zombie_goasts> Why does Bethesda refuse to sell the Doom Eternal soundtrack on a normal store?
[3:18:20] <%TIME_PUNCHER> AC will break Pat
[3:18:48] <iswearimjustdandy> @zombie_goasts its bethesda
[3:18:55] <$floralkami> pfft, you thought
[3:19:00] <person181> i left for a bit AC done now?
[3:19:06] <%honeyman18> Doom and animal crossing should be a whiplash, but filling quotas for points to unlock stuff seems about the same.
[3:19:07] <$floralkami> ye
[3:19:09] <iswearimjustdandy> @person181 yep doom time
[3:19:13] <%TIME_PUNCHER> @zombie_goasts because they don't have to pay anyone to sell it through their own store
[3:19:14] <%zombie_goasts> Animal Crossing is great for people who need a routine in their life. But the target demographic has a very niche need. So it comes off as confusing to anyone outside of that demogaphic
[3:19:23] <person181> good was hoping i wouldn't miss doom
[3:19:56] <andrei11dr> Hes at the Doom Hunter Base right?
[3:20:12] <tusk102> @andrei11dr yes
[3:20:27] <1matheuw> twitch chat just disapeared to me
[3:20:28] <%arcaderabbit48> Is he playing all of Doom over several streams, or just doing a few and then moving on?
[3:21:06] <$floralkami> @arcaderabbit48 good question, i dont know if he decided yet
[3:21:10] <1matheuw> i think he said he was going to play all of it
[3:21:44] <andrei11dr> I hope he at least gets to se axe boy
[3:22:37] <%honeyman18> I do think that the infinite Daily's in Animal Crossing is gonna be bad for me.
[3:22:52] <gekizenbu> welcome to mobile game type hell honeyman
[3:22:56] <+AlphaRayAllen> Are they really dailies if they're infinite?
[3:23:19] <%BeatBo_2> BeatBo_2 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! psaWink
[3:23:39] <%Frost_Quill> @honeyman18 It adds a good 10-30 minutes to the already 30-60 minutes people play every day.
[3:23:42] <1matheuw> infinite as in you can repeat them infinitely or infinite as in they come back on a daily basis

[3:24:05] <+ItBeNyx> hey chat did pat actually like animal crossing or no
[3:24:19] <+MuteDanger> he doesn't know
[3:24:38] <+ItBeNyx> that sounds like a yes
[3:25:07] <ShineTheDiamond> He said he wasn't sure if he was enjoying it or if he was just happy.
[3:25:14] <%Frost_Quill> @ItBeNyx No idea. He THINKS he liked it but it's not clear if it was genuine or just his mind goblins injecting that sweet sweet juice from completing tasks.
[3:25:18] <+MuteDanger> The best way I see him enjoying it is by playing it in between FF14 Queues like I'm doing.
[3:25:44] <%Dr_DangerPhD> Animal Crossing really hits it's stride when you get villagers you actually like
[3:25:49] <ShineTheDiamond> It does seem like the perfect game for those with compulsive tendencies. Or anxiety cleaners.
[3:25:51] <+FrenchTact1cs> Why the hell would Pat of all people play animal crossing, lol
[3:25:53] <%Frost_Quill> @MuteDanger Oh man I didn't even think of that. That'll be great.

[3:44:26] <tusk102> plasma chn
[3:44:29] <King_Wolf_Rigger> I just wish the Plasma Rifle sounded cooler.
[3:44:30] <hntronium> Plasma was good in Q3 Arena
[3:44:31] <gekizenbu> the shotgun is the pistol
[3:44:32] <+Jp3g95> HELLo
[3:44:34] <Sol_Install> holy shit this music so damn good
[3:44:37] <%CygnusRoboticus> dammit doomguy always with the ripping and tearing
[3:44:37] <%StaceMcGate> @Saltmeisterr The Hu are great
[3:44:40] <ShineTheDiamond> This game makes me happy
[3:44:47] <JorgenTheElf> *palsma
[3:44:47] <tusk102> god this music
[3:44:55] <%ShogunNoonto> are the classic level back ?
[3:45:08] <andrei11dr> Im sad they took the stun bomb from the plasma, but i guess it was a little too good
[3:45:13] <WarchiefGoldva> This is a very high-quality videogame, holy shit.
[3:45:16] <%Bigshimz> Hey, Pat. Love you.
[3:45:25] <%espanishcanamurciana> so what's the story here?
[3:45:29] <%MrBorisMakarov> but do it tho
[3:45:30] <tusk102> @ShogunNoonto no but you just unlock the original doom in game on doomguys cpu
[3:45:32] <snipsnoopyouvebeendooped> that's the most aggressive parkour I've seen
[3:45:32] <jorniev> look up
[3:45:32] <+TaphexWin> You can totally make that
[3:45:34] <+HazMat997> @espanishcanamurciana RIP AND TEAR
[3:45:38] <%rumtumtugnutz> Why does that wall have a metal cooter on it?
[3:45:40] <King_Wolf_Rigger> NOICE
[3:45:41] <+the_drummaestro> EZ
[3:45:42] <Dragon_Batman> Eeey
[3:45:43] <+metalsiren31> The story is there's demons and you need to shoot them
[3:45:44] <tusk102> @espanishcanamurciana KILL EM ALL
[3:45:46] <%YakumoYomi> Ayyy
[3:45:47] <%StaceMcGate> @espanishcanamurciana killing 1 of the 3 hell priests responsible for demonfying the Earth
[3:45:47] <andrei11dr> @espanishcanamurciana KILL DEMONS
[3:45:55] <+TaphexWin> Doomslayer has ridiculous mobility
[3:45:57] <tusk102> RIP
[3:45:58] <1matheuw> dump it all on the ssg
[3:45:59] <CriticKitten> RIP
[3:46:02] <%espanishcanamurciana> makes sense
[3:46:03] <+Jp3g95> F
[3:46:03] <%CygnusRoboticus> so this is actually closer to the original doom than 2016
[3:46:09] <Shishi1205> does the super shotgun require points in this game?
[3:46:11] <1matheuw> pretty much yes
[3:46:14] <%CygnusRoboticus> videogame-ass videogame level
[3:46:39] <King_Wolf_Rigger> YEYEYEYE
[3:46:41] <%Bigshimz> Damn, Doom guy moving like Arno Dorian
[3:46:42] <tusk102> @CygnusRoboticus yeah and also it is now confirmed that doomslayer is the original doomguy
[3:46:46] <%ShogunNoonto> 1 up ?
[3:46:53] <%CygnusRoboticus> @tusk102 I always believed
[3:46:58] <lionmanguy> Oh I thought pages chopping was part of the music
[3:46:59] <JorgenTheElf> As long as there's red explodey barrels, I'm in
[3:46:59] <tusk102> @ShogunNoonto they function like gold orbs
[3:47:03] <$jaxondorf> woah Animal Crossing got AWSOME!
[3:47:05] <andrei11dr> I guess he didn't do the trial door here
[3:47:06] <%StaceMcGate> Lock On
[3:47:08] <Dragon_Batman> So what does the extra life do?, quick getup after death?
[3:47:08] <+barrakuta371> micro missles
[3:47:13] <Nina96> missiles
[3:47:16] <%dekkitout> @tusk102 Did I miss the cutscene where they showed the thing that proved it?
[3:47:17] <tusk102> @CygnusRoboticus a news lady calls him doomguy and he also owns daisy doomguys rabbit
[3:47:18] <1matheuw> remote detonate is for taking weak spots
[3:47:20] <Eye_of_the_red_giant> micro missiles
[3:47:20] <WarchiefGoldva> Become Iron Man
[3:47:26] <tusk102> @dekkitout yes
[3:47:33] <hntronium> @andrei11dr He cowarded out yes
[3:47:33] <tusk102> @dekkitout well sort of
[3:47:35] <andrei11dr> Micro missile is wat i picked first
[3:47:36] <+Atomic_ColliderSG> homing on the rocket launcher is really good
[3:47:39] <RyanTheRecluse> microwave is good for the single enemy control
[3:47:40] <$jaxondorf> GivePLZ MercyWing1 PowerUpL sipsipElmo PowerUpR MercyWing2 TakeNRG
[3:47:50] <%dekkitout> I mean the one that HARD confirmed it
[3:47:57] <%Laecerelius> Time to farm!
[3:47:59] <%YakumoYomi> DO IT
[3:48:02] <vedammi> HOW LATE AM I???
[3:48:03] <andrei11dr> Iep
[3:48:04] <%StaceMcGate> @PatStaresAt you've killed over 700 demons at this point
[3:48:05] <%CygnusRoboticus> @tusk102 I have seen that; I haven't looked at anything enough to even get an inkling of where we're picking up after 2016 though
[3:48:07] <tusk102> @dekkitout no
[3:48:07] <CaptainFrankincense> 75 is alot just kidding
[3:48:10] <themisticmist2000> EZ Clap
[3:48:11] <Saltmeisterr> fun fact: micro missiles can not destroy weakpoints
[3:48:13] <1matheuw> what about the ssg pat?
[3:48:19] <WarchiefGoldva> I had to do 25 precision kills in the Crucible for the damn Ace of Spades, this is nothing compared to that.
[3:48:23] <NireFuster> PINKY
[3:48:26] <lloyddboy> BLAST HE ASS
[3:48:30] <RyanTheRecluse> you fight like 150+ demons at least every mission
[3:48:31] <tusk102> @CygnusRoboticus it's like 2 years after doom 2016 i think
[3:48:38] <andrei11dr> SHOT THEM IN THE ASS
[3:48:53] <+lethallylactic> PogChamp
[3:48:55] <%CygnusRoboticus> and earth is fuuuucked
[3:49:00] <tusk102> earth big fucked
[3:49:00] <Saltmeisterr> SourPls
[3:49:10] <tusk102> @CygnusRoboticus 60% of earths surface is now demonic
[3:49:21] <$jaxondorf> this music stresses me out
[3:49:24] <%dmtjinni> BAD
[3:49:34] <%CygnusRoboticus> PSA for viewers, don't watch 2019's DOOM: Annihilation. It's bad and doesn't even have The Rock in it to save it
[3:49:38] <andrei11dr> @cygnusroboticus Not Australia
[3:49:50] <$floralkami> GOD THIS MUSIC
[3:49:56] <tusk102> pat what was that
[3:49:58] <$Dakuu75> this music reminds me of some Samurai Jack stuff, when he fights armies of robots
[3:50:03] <Dragon_Batman> Ok it does that
[3:50:17] <Shishi1205> chainsaw some fucker
[3:50:23] <IminyourBase> gonna need a lot of extra lives
[3:50:28] <$floralkami> fucking love when music is in sync to the player's actions
[3:50:48] <%StaceMcGate> I don't think the music is dynamic in DOOM
[3:50:58] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @CygnusRoboticus Karl Urban also did a good job saving that movie. I own it for the PSP lol.
[3:51:03] <$floralkami> kinda wish the chainsaw went through that imp fucker while it was close by
[3:51:06] <+lethallylactic> monkaS
[3:51:08] <%dekkitout> Samurai Jack and Doomguy would be the best 'silent duo who have a lot to say' teamup
[3:51:14] <%dmtjinni> FOCUS
[3:51:17] <tusk102> @dekkitout though it was kinda hard confirmed when a lady called him doomguy and they show you the classic armor. but if you mean the specific cutscene then no
[3:51:18] <%ToxInjection> You should all watch the BTS stuff for the soundtrack on Youtube. Specially the heavy metal choir shit.
[3:51:20] <$floralkami> @stacemcgate it is, there's a video about it and everything
[3:51:21] <%theotherkristian> For those who have already have this game, how does ETERNAL compare to 2016's?
[3:51:36] <%Manjove> way better
[3:51:38] <Vertigheist> A big improvement
[3:51:46] <%CygnusRoboticus> I like that the possessed humans look more human than 2016
[3:51:46] <+Atomic_ColliderSG> does pat has long range glory kills?
[3:51:47] <%ToxInjection> Doom but Better
[3:51:54] <%dmtjinni> LUL\
[3:51:54] <Saltmeisterr> much better paced
[3:51:55] <$floralkami> @theotherkristian that, on crack and pcp
[3:51:56] <%StaceMcGate> @Atomic_ColliderSG yup
[3:51:57] <%Manjove> almost universally better
[3:51:58] <%dekkitout> Eternal's 1000% more videogame and colorful compared to 2016
[3:52:08] <tusk102> @theotherkristian big improvement but doesn't "invalidate" 2016. 2016 is still fun it's just not AS fun
[3:52:11] <bleugh> why would someone choose to play this on a gamepad nyannHmm
[3:52:14] <+Atomic_ColliderSG> @StaceMcGate good
[3:52:25] <tusk102> @bleugh it was pretty much made for controller
[3:52:28] <andrei11dr> @themisticmist2000 I liked 2016 built up ,but this game gives you SO MUCH TO DO
[3:52:30] <%theotherkristian> Fuck I have to buy this soon
[3:52:39] <%StaceMcGate> Pat's current runes are long-range Glory kills and time slow down while aiming
[3:52:41] <+RealPT1> Pat, did you hear Plague complain about this game having to many mechanics?
[3:52:46] <$floralkami> @bleugh cause people aren't the same
[3:52:46] <thatWaulfyguy> Pat's forgetting to talk lol
[3:52:51] <tusk102> @RealPT1 you fuckin for real?
[3:52:52] <WarchiefGoldva> That guy just belched NOO before the Slayer fucked him up.
[3:52:52] <%CygnusRoboticus> this might just be a bad level to come in on, but I don't like that this appears to be a videogame level and not a real room in a facility on mars
[3:52:52] <%theotherkristian> Doom but gooder is such a good sell for me
[3:52:56] <Dragon_Batman> Good to hear Mick Gordon still kickin ass
[3:53:03] <%CygnusRoboticus> I loved that in 2016, every room felt like it had a purpose
[3:53:07] <%dekkitout> @RealPT1 That means it has just enough mechanics sbfpRichard
[3:53:14] <%Frost_Quill> And this is where I peace out.
[3:53:17] <%StaceMcGate> @thatWaulfyguy he said last night he was era his commentary was getting worse because the game is so intense and requires focus
[3:53:18] <%ToxInjection> The animations are so SMOOTH
[3:53:30] <+RealPT1> @tusk102 he was griping when he got the freeze tool
[3:53:43] <+Euphbugg> F
[3:53:44] <%Valdorick> Damn
[3:53:45] <$floralkami> @cygnusroboticus to, don't be that guy who tried to make fun of DOOM for having platforming and shit.
[3:53:45] <+lethallylactic> F
[3:53:46] <%dmtjinni> F
[3:53:48] <lionmanguy> F
[3:53:49] <Picia000123> Man, I am too used to watching Max play with the classic gun holding
[3:53:50] <tusk102> @RealPT1 what a panzy
[3:53:54] <andrei11dr> DOOT
[3:53:54] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> this seems neat
[3:54:01] <%Manjove> there is a ton of platforming in this one
[3:54:15] <%BallerSwagBro9k> REKT
[3:54:17] <bleugh> if only he had a superior aiming device compared to a gamepad nyannHmm
[3:54:22] <andrei11dr> Man , i hate those worm guys
[3:54:29] <%mornerboi> yo that thing charging at you was actually kinda scary tbh
[3:54:31] <alcoholicstpmom> what difficulty is Pat on?
[3:54:33] <tusk102> @RealPT1 no complaining, only ripping and tearing allowed
[3:54:36] <%dmtjinni> PAT FORGOT HOW 2 PLAY DOOM
[3:54:39] <Saltmeisterr> just use motion controls Kappa
[3:54:42] <heartlesshealer> ultra violence or whatever it was
[3:54:44] <%StaceMcGate> Ultraviolent @alcoholicstpmom
[3:54:50] <%Valdorick> The Pat of Demons
[3:55:00] <RyanTheRecluse> its a lot more arcadey, atmosphere takes a hit but intensity goes way up. Beginning act of 2016 is much better than Eternals. On the other hand Eternal keeps getting better after each mission where 2016 kind of plateaued in quality after the first hell mission.
[3:55:05] <$floralkami> still can't believe some jackass best attempt at hating DOOM was saying Doom Slayer had sausage arms and looked like Spiderman with his wall climbing
[3:55:05] <%dekkitout> DoomE with trackball and voice control is the most optimal setup by far
[3:55:11] <Shishi1205> almost
[3:55:14] <%MrBorisMakarov> almost
[3:55:14] <tusk102> @Valdorick nah thats cacodoom. think about it. bright red and and orb
[3:55:14] <%CygnusRoboticus> can you get a grappling hook? this shoulder-mount secondary weapon seems like a perfect place for a grappling hook
[3:55:20] <dipstere> controller sniping LUL
[3:55:28] <gekizenbu> the hook is on the super shotgun
[3:55:32] <lionmanguy> F
[3:55:32] <tusk102> @CygnusRoboticus no but the super shotgun has a grappling hook
[3:55:32] <Macguffn> Your grappling hook is on the super shotgun
[3:55:33] <+Euphbugg> F
[3:55:33] <%dmtjinni> F
[3:55:34] <WarchiefGoldva> The Super Shotgun has a grappling hook.
[3:55:36] <%mornerboi> you just kinda stood there and took that one my guy
[3:55:38] <%StaceMcGate> The most Pat demon would be summoner, making other demons do the work for it
[3:55:39] <Tucker0603> what?
[3:55:40] <%DedlokPM> @bleugh or did like woolie and used the far superior mouse and controller. rooSmug
[3:55:40] <King_Wolf_Rigger> You got this Pat, I believe
[3:55:40] <%CygnusRoboticus> @Macguffn fucking sick
[3:55:42] <+Euphbugg> F x2
[3:55:42] <$sniffy77> Are there dootndemons?
[3:55:43] <augusta_wind> rip
[3:55:45] <%spiritofmojave> !uptime
[3:55:45] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 55m.
[3:55:58] <CaptainFrankincense> the upgraded hook is gross
[3:56:01] <+RealPT1> I'm still trying to understand what it is plague wants from games
[3:56:04] <tusk102> @sniffy77 the skin only works in multiplayer sadly
[3:56:05] <andrei11dr> He's getting he's ass kicked here ,dam
[3:56:07] <%BallerSwagBro9k> GIT GUD
[3:56:09] <$floralkami> as if DOOM isn't the epitome of VIDEO GAEM
[3:56:20] <%realm_forge> PAT YOU ARE WESKER. FIGHT LIKE WESKER
[3:56:21] <%Valdorick> THAT WAS RAD AS FUCK
[3:56:25] <%spiritofmojave> did Pat turn DOOT on
[3:56:27] <%CygnusRoboticus> AW SNAP
[3:56:32] <%CygnusRoboticus> exactly what I asked for
[3:56:35] <%mornerboi> GOD THAT HEAD SQUISH NOISE
[3:56:43] <WarchiefGoldva> Blood Punch is incredible.
[3:56:49] <$floralkami> you don't need to talk during DOOM, just play and let the viewer enjoy
[3:56:52] <tusk102> @PatStaresAt you should use the dash more often its perfect for weskering everyone
[3:57:18] <Saltmeisterr> @PatStaresAt blood punch oneshots pinkys
[3:57:35] <lloyddboy> freeze seems good for farming headshots
[3:57:44] <tusk102> @Saltmeisterr so does shooting them once in the ass with the super shotgun
[3:57:55] <%dmtjinni> god ur terrible Pat
[3:57:58] <%CygnusRoboticus> freeze bombs, bulletime, grappling, what mechanics doesn't this game have
[3:58:10] <$floralkami> Hell isn't supposed to make sense with it's design, it's literally called chaos for a reason.
[3:58:11] <%MrBorisMakarov> wall running
[3:58:12] <tusk102> @CygnusRoboticus no jetpack smh
[3:58:16] <%dekkitout> @CygnusRoboticus Summon Sword Chainsaws PunOko
[3:58:19] <Macguffn> What's that popping sound I keep hearing?
[3:58:22] <%StaceMcGate> Pat is fine
[3:58:29] <Saltmeisterr> true but u don't have to be behind them with the blood punch
[3:58:33] <heartlesshealer> you get jetpack as DOOT
[3:58:35] <%fattness132> The 'pop' is a headshot noise
[3:58:40] <%Valdorick> Hot Take - a Style meter would make DOOM even better.
[3:58:44] <%CygnusRoboticus> @tusk102 google tells me it gets jetpacks eventually
[3:58:44] <%fattness132> 'ping' is weakpoinnt destroyed
[3:58:50] <%dekkitout> @Valdorick 100%
[3:58:52] <tusk102> @CygnusRoboticus SHUT UP
[3:58:54] <%MrBorisMakarov> it also has hook drifting
[3:58:56] <Macguffn> @fattness132 thank you
[3:59:01] <%spiritofmojave> @valdorick Already has Trickster, why not
[3:59:03] <$floralkami> @valdorick if anything, that's the blood punch mechanic
[3:59:03] <tusk102> @CygnusRoboticus NO WAY
[3:59:05] <Dragon_Batman> Don't think anyone disagrees with style metere
[3:59:09] <lloyddboy> SO HERE I AM
[3:59:10] <%BallerSwagBro9k> SourPls
[3:59:11] <WarchiefGoldva> MICK GORDON DEMANDS VIOLENCE

[3:59:14] <not_twitter_rowan> ....what?
[3:59:16] <%doc_ock_rokc> DOING EVERYTHING I CAN
[3:59:16] <%dekkitout> It feels like an existential crisis?
[3:59:16] <hntronium> Existential Nightmare?
[3:59:17] <lloyddboy> RIPPING EVERYTHING I CAN
[3:59:21] <tiaramaki> HOLDING ON TO WHAT I AM
[3:59:23] <+Makototruth> I can see it.
[3:59:23] <Picia000123> This game is too sick
[3:59:25] <%D00msDayDan> tony hawk's pro slayer
[3:59:25] <%spiritofmojave> PRETENDING IM A SUPERMAN
[3:59:26] <+Pookiedaexzile> Doom guy is maxpayne, Dante, Mastercheif and Marcus Fenix

[3:59:33] <%doc_ock_rokc> PRETENDING I'M A SUPERMAN
[3:59:34] <%CygnusRoboticus> @dekkitout it's not done, continue to rip and tear until summon chainsaws
[3:59:39] <Mister_McDerp> fuck eric sparrow
[3:59:39] <Dragon_Batman> When's horse?
[3:59:41] <Shonen_hero> The hellscape that awaits him is his nightmare?
[3:59:43] <WarchiefGoldva> That poor zombo.
[3:59:44] <tusk102> i mean doomguy WAS in a tony hawk game
[3:59:44] <%mornerboi> petition to change Doom Eternal's title to 'Tony Hawk's Exestential Nightmare'
[3:59:47] <andrei11dr> One thing i will say is that it feels like you're getting swarmed from every direction more than Doom 2016
[3:59:50] <coracor> doomguy's existential nightmare: collect RIP and TEAR to 100% the level!
[3:59:52] <+MazDoThing> I really want them to just give the game a style meter
[4:00:07] <CygnusRoboticus> that would be amazing
[4:00:09] <augusta_wind> i wish doomguy had a twitter
[4:00:11] <+BigBruthaThunda> Doom: Existential
[4:00:14] <%StaceMcGate> Hard to give this game a style meter because you're expected to get hit
[4:00:15] <%Valdorick> Oh oh, he's entering the fuckbox
[4:00:18] <%doc_ock_rokc> @coracor Doomguy's Exstenctial nightmare would be Animal crossing and no demons to kill
[4:00:21] <Saltmeisterr> didn't 2016 have an Arcade mode?
[4:00:21] <lionmanguy> Are those flame guys the new imps? Or something else
[4:00:23] <$floralkami> @andrei11dr tb fair, this is on the "hard" difficulty
[4:00:24] <gekizenbu> doomguy would be the type to have an instagram but its only rabbit pictures
[4:00:25] <%fattness132> gotta prioritize that hell knight - he will rush you down all day
[4:00:26] <+baikenwitheggs> do you have unlimited chainsaw/flamethrower/cryo grenade ammo
[4:00:31] <boomstickery> dont try to face fuck the brain thing
[4:00:32] <%CygnusRoboticus> I wish hayden had a twitter
[4:00:37] <%MrBorisMakarov> YEYEYE
[4:00:38] <+Pookiedaexzile> I want a style meter mod
[4:00:38] <tusk102> @MazDoThing they could 100% use the dmc: devil may cry style meter names bc they're all talking about how badass you are like "brutal" and "sadistic" lmao
[4:00:42] <Saltmeisterr> where u had score and shit
[4:00:42] <%Bailey__gaming> this don't look like animal crossing
[4:00:47] <%StaceMcGate> @baikenwitheggs it recharges over time, look at bottom right hand corner
[4:00:47] <%doc_ock_rokc> Pat Use chainsaw on big guys to get them out of the way
[4:00:49] <%CygnusRoboticus> is hayden alive in this game? I saw he was all busted in a trailer
[4:00:50] <RyanTheRecluse> this games style meter equivalent will be an arcade mode
[4:00:55] <Macguffn> Doomguys' existential crisis is his pet rabbit being killed
[4:01:01] <andrei11dr> Doomguy is a Boomer ,i mean ,have you seen his PC LUL
[4:01:02] <arkv01> daddy hayden better be alive
[4:01:17] <%realm_forge> USE ALL YOUR WEAPONS PAT

[4:01:41] <Gamingc00l> i never realized how intense animal crossing is.
[4:01:50] <%StaceMcGate> @baikenwitheggs thats been one of peoples major bitching points, but the games gives you so many more options now that limited ammo is needed for challenge
[4:01:55] <+Jp3g95> RIP AND TEAR UNTIL IT IS DONE rooH rooGun

[4:02:21] <InfinitySaiyan> First time catching a Pat stream!!!! Wooooooooo my favorite source of RE and DMC content
[4:02:25] <arkv01> this game is going to be sick to speedrun
[4:02:27] <%CygnusRoboticus> I have a complaint
[4:02:31] <tusk102> @Bailey__gaming use the sniper. it's right and left brain can be blown out with one shot each and it does massive damage
[4:02:31] <%realm_forge> THERE YA GO
[4:02:33] <%DedlokPM> @baikenwitheggs cryo, frag, and flame thrower are unlimited with cooldown (like doom 2016 devices), chainsaw you can get extra charges for, but has 1 charge that you can get back via cooldown
[4:02:33] <lloyddboy> from below?
[4:02:34] <$floralkami> AAAAAAH, I GOT GOOSEBUMPS FROM THAT

[4:02:39] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 2m.
[4:02:39] <+MazDoThing> Now imagine a rating coming up right now and bein' like "Yeah, you get an S"
[4:02:40] <Dragon_Batman> A button or below it?
[4:02:42] <%BallerSwagBro9k> PAY MORTGAGE UNTIL IT IS DONE
[4:02:45] <%CygnusRoboticus> the flamethrower should be button you hold down until you feel like everyone's burned
[4:02:50] <+Zereaux> LEVER?
[4:02:55] <%DedlokPM> @baikenwitheggs extra charges are obtained via fuel cans
[4:02:56] <%doc_ock_rokc> I'M RUSHING AND A RUNNING GUNNING! A RECKONING OF LEAD A'COMING!
[4:02:57] <%CygnusRoboticus> the one-and-done upsets me
[4:02:58] <%spiritofmojave> RIP AND FISH
[4:03:02] <CookieDoughFK> The best way to relax after some exausting Doom is to play some Animal Crossing
[4:03:04] <+Zereaux> its napalm
[4:03:08] <%fattness132> its a flame belch, not a flame thrower
[4:03:09] <%CygnusRoboticus> @DedlokPM oh my gosh of course it is
[4:03:11] <KasiCrafter> TIP and FARE
[4:03:11] <nukle0nik> that flamethrower is more like a little burp
[4:03:14] <%realm_forge> VENT
[4:03:15] <Ipsenscastle> I can't believe there are less viewers for this than the Animal Crossing stream where nothing occurred
[4:03:21] <arkv01> should've hit the gym in the last few months so you could play doom eternal without getting winded...
[4:03:23] <heartlesshealer> hmm
[4:03:23] <+NitronStreams> Pat Rips and Stares
[4:03:30] <1matheuw> o think you will come back later?
[4:03:32] <hntronium> Maybe not from below?
[4:03:32] <heartlesshealer> were there any punch blocks?
[4:03:34] <tusk102> @nukle0nik it's almost like it's called "flame belch" for a reason...
[4:03:35] <+Zereaux> lever?????
[4:03:38] <fakkuza> that is pretty weird
[4:03:40] <$floralkami> @cygnusroboticus @nukle0nik it's called the flame BELCH for a reason

[4:10:16] <%CygnusRoboticus> I'm thinking doomguy's a demon
[4:10:17] <%crimsonharvest> in doom 2 it was like 2-3 rockets casually and you didnt even give them a second glance

[4:11:53] <tusk102> @CygnusRoboticus you mean the night sentinels? they aren't angels
[4:11:54] <CaptainFrankincense> aegis reflector
[4:11:55] <+Cityscape17> Go to your twitch prime stuff Pat and link your bethesda account with twitch to get the bonus

[4:12:11] <haisho> carcasses giving me another reason to use my favorite plasma rifle
[4:12:12] <RyanTheRecluse> fuck these guys
[4:12:13] <tusk102> @PatStaresAt plasma probably busts through those
[4:12:16] <crowspeak> Look at all this platforming Doomguy would be perfect for Smash!
[4:12:18] <$floralkami> @tusk102 the angels are butthurt cause doomguy is fighting
[4:12:21] <Idon__> holy SHIT
[4:12:22] <+Axellogic> Axellogic subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 15 months! 
[4:12:30] <%dmtjinni> Corona Virus... SHIT IS REAL
[4:12:35] <%CygnusRoboticus> @barkon345 safe bet, but I like a world where there's JUST hell
[4:12:36] <tusk102> @floralkami what angels???
[4:12:36] <$megamonmon123> they fucking give you alot of shit to do in this game. like I forget about the grenade so much
[4:12:55] <InfinitySaiyan> @patstaresat I made it!!!! First time catching a Pat stream!!!! Wooooooooo my favorite source of RE and DMC content

[4:13:25] <%dmtjinni> NOICE
[4:13:28] <1matheuw> yeah in the master levels if you forget shit you die like a bitche
[4:13:29] <King_Wolf_Rigger> literally a question mark
[4:13:33] <Ipsenscastle> I want these toys
[4:13:34] <%MrBorisMakarov> MrBorisMakarov gifted a Tier 1 sub to tusk102! They have given 230 Gift Subs in the channel! 
[4:13:34] <%dekkitout> That looks rad, I want 3 as paper weights
[4:13:35] <%SoFarFetched> did you miss some things on the map?
[4:13:40] <haisho> I wonder how Woolie would feel about the action figures looking like Funko Pops...
[4:13:41] <Mister_McDerp> yeah
[4:13:42] <%StaceMcGate> LORE
[4:13:45] <%SoFarFetched> oh there they are
[4:13:46] <%Valdorick> Eeeeeeh
[4:13:46] <Shishi1205> I wouldnt call it natural
[4:13:47] <+Cityscape17> I wanna see Pat use the unicorn :D
[4:13:48] <%tusk102> @MrBorisMakarov Thanks for the gift sub! i'm poor
[4:13:50] <%crimsonharvest> shit my sub is running out
[4:13:52] <%Louie_Salmon> Secret design in general is very good in this
[4:13:52] <go4thekneez> i wish the secret stuff was actually interesting and not dumb collectibles and lore
[4:13:54] <$floralkami> @tusk102 they don't look like typical angels, but at the a bit after the beginning of the game, one of them speaks to you about "going against tradition" and letting the humans pay their repentance, and how Doomguy is fucking their plans up
[4:13:57] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Yea, they made the secrets less "Annoying"
[4:13:59] <$megamonmon123> yeah id say so, though I missed a few in some levels
[4:14:00] <%tusk102> psaDab
[4:14:01] <%realm_forge> I imagine doomguy crawls up those walls like the second boss from RE7
[4:14:03] <lloyddboy> HELL'S EMISSARY, JAPANESE SPIDERMAN
[4:14:05] <%crimsonharvest> it says 4 hours until my sub repops
[4:14:13] <mexicansunglasses> Lore in a Doom game ResidentSleeper
[4:14:16] <+Atomic_ColliderSG> I'm like 100% sure Ranak is Steve Blum
[4:14:23] <Ipsenscastle> Boris Makarov is the Santa of Pat's stream
[4:14:23] <%tusk102> @floralkami thats the night sentinel king
[4:14:25] <%CygnusRoboticus> HOW
[4:14:26] <megaman_sentinel> sol
[4:14:26] <JorgenTheElf> Doomguy needs to wrestle an angel for a blessing
[4:14:28] <%CygnusRoboticus> HOW HOW HOW HOW HOW
[4:14:43] <coreybom> @mexicansunglasses Did you not play 2016? The lore was one of the best parts?
[4:14:44] <%StaceMcGate> NO TIME
[4:14:44] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> yeah
[4:14:45] <megaman_sentinel> he sold us out lol
[4:14:45] <not_twitter_rowan> @JorgenTheElf dude I think he already did, remember the Slayer Testaments
[4:14:46] <$floralkami> @tusk102 not that guy, earlier
[4:14:48] <InfinitySaiyan> @patstaresat Yo I finally made it!!!! First time catching a Pat stream!!!! Been trying forever! Wooooooooo my favorite source of RE and DMC content
[4:14:53] <+Cityscape17> Go check twitch prime @PatStaresAt
[4:14:55] <%tusk102> @floralkami khan makyr?
[4:15:01] <$megamonmon123> @patstaresat think of her as an smt angel
[4:15:01] <WarchiefGoldva> Maybe always debil, but never angle
[4:15:02] <%crimsonharvest> so 'sacrifice' means opening Earth up to being terraformed by demons to a hell planet? and thats how hell expands?
[4:15:04] <%dekkitout> The Angel had and angle and became a debil
[4:15:06] <@commanderclaw> Saving throw is the shit
[4:15:07] <mexicansunglasses> @coreybom The best part that stopped the frentic pacing dead in it's tracks?
[4:15:09] <Saltmeisterr> they explain later
[4:15:15] <Ipsenscastle> Probably some sort of twist
[4:15:16] <%fattness132> Speed boost is so helpful to stay alive
[4:15:16] <KasiCrafter> Speed.
[4:15:17] <hntronium> speed boost is good
[4:15:18] <andrei11dr> So wat im wondering, is Doom 2 cannon in this universe, because if it is ,than that means this is the second time around the earth got fucked
[4:15:20] <KasiCrafter> You'll want speed.
[4:15:20] <Yummy_Nukes> @patstaresat maybe something like a fallen angle?
[4:15:24] <%StaceMcGate> Speed
[4:15:26] <Vertigheist> @mexicansunglasses petty
[4:15:29] <$floralkami> @tusk102 the long, talk bitch
[4:15:29] <megaman_sentinel> yea speed
[4:15:30] <$megamonmon123> she doesnt really care about perserving life as much as some sort of cosmic balance
[4:15:32] <+MazDoThing> Speed boost is pretty sick
[4:15:33] <$floralkami> tall
[4:15:34] <%crimsonharvest> syringe attack
[4:15:34] <%fattness132> you go SO FAST
[4:15:36] <Idon__> ZOOM SLAYER
[4:15:37] <%CygnusRoboticus> hayden needs to come back and just clean all this bullshit up with his good friend doomslayer
[4:15:39] <JorgenTheElf> @not_twitter_rowan I clearly need to catch up on Doom lore.
[4:15:44] <%tusk102> @floralkami yeah she's khan makyr. she's an angel?
[4:15:46] <gekizenbu> all dooms and all WADs are canon. yes even the new mod where Isabelle is a companion
[4:15:55] <+Atomic_ColliderSG> would have gone with the saving throw
[4:16:06] <Ipsenscastle> If you don't get to pilot a giant mech by the end I'll be upset
[4:16:08] <InfinitySaiyan> @patstaresat I made it!!!! First time catching a Pat stream!!!! Wooooooooo my favorite source of RE and DMC content!
[4:16:11] <fobitbswo> hey pat
[4:16:16] <not_twitter_rowan> @JorgenTheElf just look up the Slayer Testaments on Youtube
[4:16:17] <%tusk102> @gekizenbu even "sean connery gets a rusty scredriver stuck up his anal hole the movie the game"?
[4:16:19] <coreybom> @mexicansunglasses You seem to be the only person I've seen that doesn't like the lore. Plus, you didn't need to read it during combat. Unless, you did, in which in that case that's your issue.
[4:16:29] <WarchiefGoldva> People BUILT THIS with TAXES
[4:16:32] <%depressed_skeleton> Wot
[4:16:34] <$joylent_blue> InfinitySaiyan welcome dude VoHiYo
[4:16:36] <%depressed_skeleton> that didn't happen in mine
[4:16:36] <gekizenbu> @tusk102 that one's a good questioon
[4:16:44] <$floralkami> @tusk102 from what it seemed like, yes. not actively trying to put hell on Earth, but was definitely saying it was holy Justice or some shit
[4:16:45] <King_Wolf_Rigger> What is this fucking Galaxy Quest bullshit room?
[4:16:47] <InfinitySaiyan> @joylent_blue thank you :)
[4:16:49] <%snow_bush> How goes the eternal dooting?
[4:16:55] <Valdorick> HITBOX PORN
[4:17:04] <fobitbswo> @King_Wolf_Rigger this episode was poorly written
[4:17:12] <%tusk102> didn't pat get the micro missiles upgrade?
[4:17:20] <%CygnusRoboticus> @snow_bush rip and tear until it's done
[4:17:21] <%StaceMcGate> yes
[4:17:21] <WarchiefGoldva> BIG ZOOM
[4:17:22] <hntronium> I think so
[4:17:23] <%dekkitout> Spood Beest
[4:17:24] <InfinitySaiyan> @joylent_blue was hoping pat would at least see it but that’s life
[4:17:24] <%king_wragles> Ooooooh, Pat just got the Glory speed boost?
[4:17:25] <%Laecerelius> Pat has micro missiles
[4:17:26] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @fobitbswo By Grapthar's hammer!
[4:17:27] <%king_wragles> It's really helpful
[4:17:31] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt are you gonna try the micro missiles at all?
[4:17:34] <$floralkami> @tusk102 I may be mistaken, but it was also hinted at with the later level designs and the teasers before the game came out
[4:17:42] <$megamonmon123> favourite weapon so far @patstaresat
[4:17:55] <%dmtjinni> EVERYONE go look up Cardi B's Corona Virus remix on YT psaOrange
[4:17:57] <andrei11dr> I hope he gets the fling knee execution on the Hell Nights cuz its awesome
[4:17:59] <$joylent_blue> InfinitySaiyan yeah chat messages are a gamble, especially with a game like Doom :D
[4:18:00] <PrinceOfEden> lol
[4:18:02] <Idon__> click click
[4:18:04] <+NitronStreams> this is "Adrenaline: the game
[4:18:05] <%fattness132> click click click
[4:18:06] <%tusk102> @floralkami hmm i see
[4:18:08] <%Louie_Salmon> Micromissiles are definitely a little nerfed from the last game
[4:18:20] <coreybom> @dmtjinni I know she didn't.
[4:18:24] <%king_wragles> @PatStaresAt you can empty a salvo of micro missiles and then go into the normal fire mode without pause.
[4:18:29] <fobitbswo> how far is he
[4:18:29] <%StaceMcGate> 30% of the way there
[4:18:33] <mexicansunglasses> @coreybom They put the lore in solely to make it like a billion other AAA's. Not every game needs a text collectible. Homogenized design=bad.
[4:18:35] <%californaya> that map is cool as hell
[4:18:38] <%king_wragles> I'll let you figure out how that's helpful
[4:18:39] <%tusk102> @Louie_Salmon i think they lowered the damage but upped the ammount you shoot?
[4:18:41] <1matheuw> i mean they were quite bulshit last game
[4:18:43] <InfinitySaiyan> @joylent_blue I got lucky on DechartGames birthday stream. He read all 4 of my comments and it blew my mind
[4:18:46] <%CygnusRoboticus> the micromissiles appear to be quite good
[4:18:48] <WarchiefGoldva> I'll definitely get the upgrade that makes Blood Punch kills heal me. It's like an AoE glory kill.
[4:18:53] <$floralkami> @tusk102 like, they said Doomguy will be facing more than just the demons, and some real pristine holy order chapel level designs
[4:18:57] <%ChaosAethr> the song man'
[4:19:05] <%realm_forge> This is a thinkin man’s shooter
[4:19:11] <%tusk102> @floralkami hmmmmmm possibly
[4:19:24] <%StaceMcGate> LUL
[4:19:25] <InfinitySaiyan> @patstaresat Hey I made it!!!! First time catching a Pat stream!!!! Finally! Wooooooooo my favorite source of RE and DMC content ever!
[4:19:26] <%tusk102> of course i cum fast i got fish to catch
[4:19:34] <fobitbswo> have we seen the elmo boy this stream
[4:19:41] <andrei11dr> Lock on ?
[4:19:42] <Idon__> WHY
[4:19:43] <PrinceOfEden> ?!
[4:19:52] <King_Wolf_Rigger> So cool
[4:19:55] <InfinitySaiyan> Ah well I tried
[4:19:56] <%tusk102> P a t
[4:19:57] <Mister_McDerp> LUL
[4:19:58] <$joylent_blue> such a cool guy
[4:20:00] <fobitbswo> beefed it
[4:20:01] <$floralkami> you shouldn't have digged up that time, stupid
[4:20:02] <%spiritofmojave> veryyyy cool
[4:20:03] <Mister_McDerp> how cool
[4:20:04] <Idon__> literally look before you leap
[4:20:05] <coreybom> @mexicansunglasses Dude, they lore is not only legitimately well rewritten, but you don't need to read once you get it. Hell, a good part is the fact the Doom slayer does not give two shits about the reasons.
[4:20:08] <%depressed_skeleton> That was pretty cool
[4:20:18] <+Onyxdeus> It's a long walk back to that board.
[4:20:26] <coreybom> @mexicansunglasses *written
[4:20:31] <InfinitySaiyan> @joylent_blue he played crash which is his favorite childhood game
[4:20:57] <WarchiefGoldva> This game is SO CHUNKY, I can feel the impact from here!
[4:21:01] <RyanTheRecluse> @mexicansunglasses But doom has had text collectibles since Doom 3 in 2003, so its perfectly fine for them to maintain an element of the series.
[4:21:01] <$floralkami> @mexicansunglasses dude, just cause you don't wanna read, doesn't mean other people don't enjoy it. also, like every other game, it IS optional
[4:21:02] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt i think the plasma rifle fucks up those dudes shields
[4:21:05] <%fattness132> @PatStaresAt you can blow up those bigger shields with the plasma rifle as well
[4:21:09] <Shishi1205> monkaS
[4:21:10] <Tucker0603> I think the plasma rifle beats the shit outta shields
[4:21:18] <$megamonmon123> you get those secrets from some sick platforming
[4:21:18] <%tusk102> wowie
[4:21:19] <dukenux> huh
[4:21:21] <Ipsenscastle> uhhh
[4:21:21] <%patriotrenegade> Are ya winning, son?
[4:21:25] <%tusk102> what
[4:21:34] <%dekkitout> Did- did you win a prize?
[4:21:37] <%patriotrenegade> Ok
[4:21:39] <dukenux> what difficulty is Pat playing?
[4:21:42] <Ipsenscastle> @dekkitout haha
[4:21:47] <InfinitySaiyan> Alright well I have to go, but I’ll watch this later on YT. Have fun everyone!
[4:21:52] <%tusk102> DUKI NUKI
[4:21:52] <$floralkami> imagine being in 2020 complaining that there's optional lore in your video game
[4:21:53] <andrei11dr> Man,the Hell Barons are going to be TOUGH on this difficulty
[4:21:58] <dan_g_v> see ya
[4:22:00] <%Louie_Salmon> Don't forget about fast travel, so you can come back for stuff
[4:22:00] <dukenux> thank, Pat
[4:22:00] <InfinitySaiyan> Enjoy the game!!! Goodbye
[4:22:02] <$megamonmon123> YEP
[4:22:02] <%tusk102> "my nam is duki nuki"
[4:22:07] <$megamonmon123> this mode is no joke
[4:22:08] <%Valdorick> It needs to take stool softener
[4:22:09] <fobitbswo> he plays ultra violence because he is a big strong
[4:22:10] <bleugh> eat more fiber
[4:22:12] <haisho> Look on the bright side, you can appreciate not playing on NIghtmare soon
[4:22:16] <Shishi1205> this really feels like somebody played dmc 5 and said we can do that
[4:22:21] <arkv01> ultra violence is the only canon doom difficulty
[4:22:26] <$megamonmon123> time for secret platforming
[4:22:27] <arkv01> all the other ones are just give up machine simulations
[4:22:29] <$floralkami> imagine being in 2020 complaining that your game was developed with a well thought out story in mind
[4:22:30] <%StaceMcGate> @PatStaresAt how many bosses are you expecting in this game?
[4:22:36] <%BallerSwagBro9k> No its not just GIT GUD LUL

[4:22:55] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @InfinitySaiyan If you don't want to wait for the VOD, he saves them on Twitch as well so you can catch it here.

[4:23:21] <$floralkami> imagine being in 2020 complaining that your game was developed with passion, and love of the franchise and history
[4:23:27] <coreybom> @floralkami And not only that, but the game STILL focused on having damn good gameplay first and foremost.
[4:23:29] <%tusk102> silver bullet?

[4:23:51] <%CygnusRoboticus> the fact that this is just a videogame level irks me greatly
[4:23:54] <$floralkami> @coreybom and yet, there MUST be something to complain about
[4:23:55] <Ipsenscastle> Doomguy's crab climb is fucking hilarious

[4:24:52] <fobitbswo> the re3 demo was incred
[4:24:53] <%StaceMcGate> Keen has been dead a loooong time
[4:24:54] <arkv01> keen did a big coom and ded
[4:24:54] <Yummy_Nukes> @patstaresat you gotta jump down the hole where you found the cheat
[4:25:00] <$floralkami> Pat will always be either RE or DMC first and foremost
[4:25:02] <%tusk102> nice!
[4:25:05] <Saltmeisterr> he's now a mobile game
[4:25:05] <Ipsenscastle> noice
[4:25:06] <coreybom> @king_wolf_rigger Let's just say he's in Mobile game hell
[4:25:08] <%PlainSimpleTailor> The sound design in this game is orgasmic
[4:25:09] <+Euphbugg> yay, he didn't punch the ghost
[4:25:21] <%StaceMcGate> @PatStaresAt you got 6 tokens, gonna spend em?
[4:25:24] <King_Wolf_Rigger> But Keen normally, right? Everybody talking like he got fucked by the shadows lol
[4:25:32] <King_Wolf_Rigger> *Keen died normally
[4:25:38] <Essixian> @dukenux @bleugh @andrei11dr @1matheuw @saiyan24675 @arkv01 Keen isn't dead, that mobile game was a dark alternate timeline that is not canon
[4:25:40] <$floralkami> @euphbugg he seems to only punch USC and demon related stuff
[4:25:55] <%tusk102> @King_Wolf_Rigger we dunno how he died. all we know is doomguy has his skull in his bedroom
[4:26:04] <mike_wate> THIS GAME DOESNT HAVE GREAT CHARACTER MODELS
[4:26:20] <Saltmeisterr> @mike_wate ok
[4:26:21] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @tusk102 Well damn, I missed that.
[4:26:22] <%machshop> oh
[4:26:28] <dan_g_v> cool
[4:26:31] <gekizenbu> @King_Wolf_Rigger blame oculus rift developer and known computer cyborg John Carmack for putting his hung corpse (of multiples) in Doom 2 because he didnt like working on Keen games
[4:26:32] <%Emperor_Machinus> @mike_wate Has great role models though
[4:26:33] <WarchiefGoldva> I wonder what the purpose of these flying coffins are.
[4:26:34] <+Euphbugg> @floralkami last night he always punched the ghost before picking up the token, not really anything to it but was just funny yesterday
[4:26:37] <%Valdorick> Keen is not only dead, but his skull was found in hell in 2017

[4:42:50] <$floralkami> @andrei11dr they would, no joke. it would be on brand at this point
[4:42:51] <persona_is_datingsimtrash> i can't believe people are complaining about doom actually having a story and lore
[4:42:52] <Ipsenscastle> What are these episode one energy barriers for
[4:42:55] <jubejube56> Oh geez what happened to the DOOM 2016 UI?
[4:42:59] <%DedlokPM> you left a ghoul alive back there
[4:42:59] <+maenos2> welp my boss texted to say we all aren't in Monday so looks like we are finally closed.

[4:43:03] <%bigmacjack12> psaBig
[4:43:09] <%DedlokPM> nm think he chased you
[4:43:18] <boomstickery> @floralkami i thought so to, ahving only been to disneyland paris and been meh about it, but apparently florida is a whoel better thing and they got the adult stuff liek elt into the park at night
[4:43:21] <%StaceMcGate> Mettaton has feelings
[4:43:25] <%DedlokPM> or maybe not
[4:43:28] <%spiritofmojave> how would you know pixvCri
[4:43:29] <%za7az> Don
[4:43:30] <ncisgabe> !uptime
[4:43:30] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 43m.
[4:43:31] <Shishi1205> they have the ghost feelings tho
[4:43:34] <%FoogUwU> That's very mortalist of you Patrick
[4:43:34] <Dragon_Batman> Why do you think they stay around, they all butt hurt
[4:43:35] <+SH1NK1R0> How is patron doing?
[4:43:36] <1matheuw> i dont have to tolerate this speciest
[4:43:37] <%za7az> Pat, don't be racist
[4:43:38] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt mettaton and blooky have feelings tho
[4:43:38] <Shishi1205> not the feelings of a ghost
[4:43:39] <jellssssss20> Wait, why can't we speak ill of the dead if ghosts don't have feelings?
[4:43:43] <SparkAfterDark> When you eat you're actually getting proportionately LESS fat. If you eat a pound of food, that' means that a larger percentage of your bodyweight is now made up of nonfat material. So you're never less fat than right after you eat a big meal technically.
[4:43:47] <+Remery_> but those ghost blowjobs tho
[4:43:50] <$floralkami> @tusk102 also I think there may be levels to the blood punch, but *shrug*
[4:43:50] <andrei11dr> I hope we get to punch Satan
[4:43:56] <chhdez> If ghosts can give blowjobs you better believe they have feelings
[4:43:59] <Saltmeisterr> ok mike is just baiting at this point
[4:44:03] <%tusk102> pepega
[4:44:04] <arkv01> @SparkAfterDark that is a dangerous slope
[4:44:09] <boomstickery> getting into anuy theme park at night and still allowed to go on all the rides while theres nly like 100 people in the park is great
[4:44:16] <%StaceMcGate> Prostitutes give blowjobs...but they're dead inside
[4:44:19] <%dmtjinni> If I didn't lose my job I would be playing this rn :(
[4:44:22] <SparkAfterDark> @arkv01 All slopes are dangerous when you are an orb
[4:44:23] <%NWR_James> @chhdez does that mean autoblow has feelings?
[4:44:28] <chhdez> Yes
[4:44:28] <%CygnusRoboticus> @chhdez dan ackroyd knows
[4:44:31] <+maenos2> @chhdez I mean emotionless sex is a thing so...
[4:44:33] <SubjectTea> @chhdez lmao

[4:44:43] <%DedlokPM> Sashimi! teenYEY
[4:44:44] <arkv01> @SparkAfterDark true, might as well double down and put a jetpack on the orb
[4:44:44] <Ipsenscastle> @chhdez some of the best blowjobs are from people who feel nothing anymore
[4:44:47] <1matheuw> prowlers are imps that teleport
[4:44:50] <$floralkami> @boomstickery well the only one I know is Disney in Orlando, and I say it's not worth it.
[4:45:00] <%CygnusRoboticus> holy crap is that an xcom 2?

[4:45:14] <%DedlokPM> @CygnusRoboticus it's a plague bait

[4:48:57] <$megamonmon123> the secret is in the hole on the map where the stairs are. you have to shoot a green target next to the staircase @patstaresat
[4:49:05] <CrazyMedicine> Oh no

[4:50:26] <divic87> man, if only they died in one hit.
[4:50:26] <SparkAfterDark> Who wants to bet that when you finally get to the boss, someone else walks in and just fucking obliterates it

[4:50:42] <%TheActuallyGuy> SHOOT BUTTON ON CEILING

[4:53:28] <arkv01> HOVER LEGS
[4:53:33] <Finakala> Necron Destroyer
[4:53:33] <arkv01> we armored core now
[4:53:39] <MasterTonberry23> Giving you the weak point like House of the Dead
[4:53:40] <andrei11dr> AXE YOU A QUESTION
[4:53:43] <$floralkami> Doomguy is just thinking "shut up so I can kill it already"
[4:53:46] <Ipsenscastle> WHAT A BITCH
[4:53:49] <boomstickery> hover legs, roket skull, and a pannin maker
[4:53:53] <mannywatcha> Question is that guy German?
[4:53:54] <%CygnusRoboticus> enemy designed to kill you and only you
[4:53:54] <jellssssss20> That's a normal enemy isn't it?
[4:53:55] <%Valdorick> Seems really lame ot just tell you the weakness of a boss right waway.
[4:53:57] <$megamonmon123> this took me a bit
[4:53:58] <$floralkami> OH FUCK IT'S FAST
[4:53:59] <+axebird> Would have been so much cooler of a moment without that tutorial pop up, what a joke
[4:54:00] <mannywatcha> Is this guy German?
[4:54:01] <%CygnusRoboticus> oh what a surprise he's a total bitchfest
[4:54:01] <SparkAfterDark> I can't believe it's a real fight. This guy is gonna be regular enemy next chapter
[4:54:05] <Saltmeisterr> SourPls
[4:54:09] <andrei11dr> No wait that's later thats right LUL
[4:54:13] <+BigBruthaThunda> Not very intimidating when tutorial vids show them getting fucked
[4:54:13] <%Verd_254> not sure how i feel about there being a huge tutorial for each enemy. can you turn those off?
[4:54:17] <$megamonmon123> i think going for the sled is better
[4:54:23] <$floralkami> @axebird well, you can turn them off
[4:54:26] <$megamonmon123> the shield is too annoying to deal with
[4:54:26] <MasterTonberry23> Those other enemies are really just health and armor crates
[4:54:39] <masheshardest> chainsaw
[4:54:42] <coreybom> @verd_254 Yep. you can turn tutorials off in the pause options.
[4:54:43] <ToneBacas> the extra enemies are just walking medpacks waiting to be open
[4:54:48] <+Pookiedaexzile> All these manever moves and you walk into the bullets
[4:54:50] <%CygnusRoboticus> pat
[4:54:51] <+axebird> @floralkami Sure, but tthey should probably be off by default or just not exist at all
[4:54:52] <%CygnusRoboticus> spat
[4:54:54] <divic87> @Verd_254 you can, but trust me when i say that on UV, that tutorials dont matter in the least.
[4:54:59] <neptious> Eternal is just disappointing after Woolie's 2016 LP
[4:55:01] <SparkAfterDark> Remember your dash is for dodging not just platforming
[4:55:02] <LoneO7> you dont want to get close to him
[4:55:05] <+Pookiedaexzile> 3 different dashes
[4:55:07] <%doc_ock_rokc> LOCAL MAN TOO ANGRY TO DIE
[4:55:18] <%espanishcanamurciana> is this just first person Diablo 3 w guns?
[4:55:20] <%CygnusRoboticus> pat's competency, this guy can't not be a total jobber
[4:55:28] <%dmtjinni> oh no
[4:55:36] <$floralkami> @axebird dude, no. just... no. games need accessibility, not even is a tryhard or Grump
[4:55:37] <%CygnusRoboticus> he was built up too much
[4:55:41] <%Verd_254> @divic87 i don't doubt it, but it's not even an issue of difficulty. It's a matter of discovery, you know? It's fun to find that stuff on your own.
[4:55:45] <$floralkami> *not everyone
[4:55:54] <andrei11dr> Man i don't like tha ads they added with the boss, i prefer the 1v1 from 2016
[4:56:04] <+Pookiedaexzile> Chat, He has 2 dashes....and still corners himself
[4:56:13] <+Pookiedaexzile> I love pat
[4:56:19] <divic87> think of the adds as "mobile ammo/health dispensers"
[4:56:21] <JorgenTheElf> The heaviest demons on Twitch!
[4:56:23] <coreybom> @axebird In fairness, would you be able to find it's weak points?
[4:56:26] <+axebird> @floralkami I'm not saying ditch tutorials. I'm saying big video tutorials that pop up when you encounter enemies are a huge mood killer. They already highlight weak points in red and have codex entries that list weak points if you want to find out about them
[4:56:29] <$megamonmon123> @pookiedaexzile its alot to remember so I give him a pass
[4:56:44] <%dekkitout> Wow, way to dis all adds by comparing them to these jobbers LUL
[4:56:47] <$megamonmon123> @axebird its your first time fighting the enemy though
[4:56:49] <+fizzguy47> It is easy to get cornered tbh, demons will spawn behind you

[4:59:39] <%bensonplayspokemon> CHUGGACHUGGAWEEEEEE
[4:59:43] <%CygnusRoboticus> @AllenDeadman this game appears pretty good, but it's much more VIDEO GAME than 2016
[4:59:59] <%doc_ock_rokc> Shields pat
[5:00:00] <SparkAfterDark> Just shoot the sled duders
[5:00:02] <+AllenDeadman> good, doom is meant to be a videogame-ass videogame

[5:00:05] <%tusk102> pat isn't breaking their shields
[5:00:07] <%WhereIsWill> funny. the boss is saying the same thing
[5:00:11] <dking0000> Holy shit this a good ass fame
[5:00:16] <%doc_ock_rokc> @CygnusRoboticus ZERO
[5:00:19] <+axebird> What does that even mean Pat
[5:00:21] <%StaceMcGate> AGNI AND RUDRA
[5:00:24] <%neVan0> LUL
[5:00:25] <persona_is_datingsimtrash> a video game being too video gamey is apparently a bad thing these days, i blame TLOU and GoW
[5:00:28] <Solarint> what difficulty is he playing on?
[5:00:32] <andrei11dr> @cygnusroboticus Guess wat
[5:00:34] <j0ustar> SADISTIC
[5:00:39] <SparkAfterDark> This looks like fucking Tribes right now
[5:00:43] <jellssssss20> refuses to use the weapon that breaks their shields
[5:00:45] <divic87> yeah ive been trying to find out difficulty. Looks like its HMP
[5:00:46] <%CygnusRoboticus> @doc_ock_rokc it already happened once in his own boss fight, let's see how far ID goes
[5:00:46] <%PanicSwytch> SSS
[5:00:49] <jellssssss20> ah ther it is
[5:00:51] <megaminimechamocha> Not *quite* enough High Times in this one though
[5:00:53] <$floralkami> @axebird it means you've got to be quick, stylish, relying on instinct for the most part, and could use a style meter
[5:00:57] <+Pookiedaexzile> SMOKING SEXY STYLE
[5:00:58] <+maenos2> @sparkafterdark
[5:01:03] <Solarint> yeah looks like HMP
[5:01:04] <%Valdorick> It can't be Devil May Cry though, I haven't seen the negtive reveiw by someone complaining about paying 60 bucks to be caleld dismal
[5:01:05] <+maenos2> oops. Yeah it does
[5:01:05] <%WhereIsWill> stick n move pat!

[5:01:20] <$megamonmon123> nope
[5:01:23] <1matheuw> proly not
[5:01:25] <+fizzguy47> Weapon switching instead of style switch
[5:01:28] <divic87> @Solarint agreed
[5:01:28] <%king_wragles> He missed, but it doesn't
[5:01:34] <%CygnusRoboticus> wait a second

[5:01:39] <mannywatcha> probably not
[5:01:42] <dking0000> Is it too spoiler-y to say there’s basically a style meter cheat?
[5:01:47] <$floralkami> YO, IMAGINE TRIBES WITH THIS LEVEL OF GAMEPLAY
[5:01:53] <neptious> @CygnusRoboticus I looked it up cuz who cares and yeah they broke him and fucked up the voice
[5:01:53] <%WarlockaFlocka> WarlockaFlocka subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months! Out of work for 2 weeks. I can either self-improve and be productive or I can be a degenerate on FFXIV.
[5:01:57] <%PanicSwytch> If woolie was playing he would have royal guard
[5:01:57] <%CygnusRoboticus> why is this boss arena all stone block construction in a future space facility?
[5:02:00] <%neVan0> DISMAL
[5:02:06] <Saltmeisterr> @dking0000 wait what?
[5:02:15] <+Pookiedaexzile> CRAZY
[5:02:15] <%D00msDayDan> @CygnusRoboticus the lab base was built on top of ancient ruins

[5:02:36] <%king_wragles> @PatStaresAt this fight is a bitch, it's really good too
[5:02:36] <hntronium> I wish multiplayer was more like a bunch of doomguys beating the shit out of each other
[5:02:36] <$floralkami> @cygnusroboticus it's an old USC base fucked with the brim with demons and energy
[5:02:37] <lloyddboy> gotta push when you break the shield

[5:03:06] <Saltmeisterr> @dking0000 oh that one. i wouldn't say that's a style mode
[5:03:12] <%TheBigTaco> You gotta do damage once you break the shield
[5:03:14] <neptious> Pat are you playing Skyrim
[5:03:14] <divic87> stupid that he dropped or stupid that the design changed?
[5:03:23] <+Pookiedaexzile> You have a shot gun

[5:03:26] <+Pookiedaexzile> That dashes
[5:03:27] <+fizzguy47> Yeah, you gotta be more reserved on UV, the dmg is pretty high
[5:03:41] <megaminimechamocha> Wait so what level is Pat on?
[5:03:43] <%doc_ock_rokc> @TheBigTaco there is two ways to fight him Shoot his "Legs" or burn off the shield
[5:03:47] <$floralkami> @cygnusroboticus dude, have you played any of the original DOOM games? this is what that is. what you're asking for sounds more like Doom 3
[5:03:56] <divic87> @PatStaresAt Micromissles break those skiffs really fast
[5:03:56] <SparkAfterDark> He's still in the tutorial
[5:04:05] <1matheuw> are we still on taris?

[5:04:47] <mannywatcha> Damn the real guns are his punches!
[5:04:51] <Jakeofalco> Is this far into the game ?
[5:04:55] <$floralkami> One Guy is doing great work today
[5:05:02] <%TheBigTaco> @doc_ock_rokc oh I thought you could only damage the machine part after breaking the shield, my bad
[5:05:07] <%CygnusRoboticus> @floralkami yesss I know, 2016 felt like a real mars base and a real hell expedition and I've been spoiled on that clearly
[5:05:09] <mannywatcha> I hate to be bitch slapped by doom guy. No matter how much it might turn me on.
[5:05:14] <andrei11dr> @megaminimechamocha I think its part of level 3

[5:06:36] <%Dementedpenguin> @MasterTonberry23 I only considered The Old Blood to be the best of the new games. Everything else was meh
[5:06:42] <$floralkami> @cygnusroboticus I mean you say that, but you also gotta remember that the Earth has been FUCKED and hell is literally supposed to be insensible chaos.
[5:06:43] <megaminimechamocha> @CygnusRoboticus Hopefully more of BJ's kids, just give them fun gameplay to do
[5:06:44] <+Pookiedaexzile> So when is Bethsda gonna make Blood 3

[5:07:23] <WarchiefGoldva> HOLY, that was a 40% Blood Punch!
[5:07:25] <andrei11dr> @pookiedaexzile I thought Blood was owned by a different company
[5:07:32] <KimilanTV> I love that this early on in the game it's still really tough. I cant wait till Pat sees the next Guardian
[5:07:34] <%king_wragles> @PatStaresAt they only have one glory kill
[5:07:35] <%StaceMcGate> VANQUISHED
[5:07:36] <$megamonmon123> gg pat

[5:17:04] <%EtheralFlameX> You have to exit to the main menu if you want to change skins
[5:17:12] <MasterTonberry23> @hzealot About that...just keep watching
[5:17:14] <KimilanTV> @hzealot some people call him Doomguy
[5:17:16] <SparkAfterDark> I love the idea that this is just how doomguy gets around his secret base

[5:17:18] <1matheuw> proly
[5:17:19] <bearking05> maybe

[5:17:22] <gatoralus> most likely
[5:17:26] <megaminimechamocha> Just Doom Guys being Doom Dudes
[5:17:27] <SparkAfterDark> Like, yeah he's just jumping off shit nonstop
[5:17:29] <$floralkami> @hzealot he's clearly evolved from just Doom "guy", tho
[5:17:30] <%CygnusRoboticus> I cannot process how much of a videogame-ass videogame this is
[5:17:37] <hzealot> thats fair
[5:17:40] <%CygnusRoboticus> it's so videogame I can't handle it
[5:17:46] <@commanderclaw> The weird part is that there's going to be Campaign DLC
[5:17:49] <bluebiscuit94> go back down

[5:17:59] <$megamonmon123> i love how this fortress doesnt float but distorts space
[5:17:59] <SparkAfterDark> Do you think he pisses off the side of the railing into space? I think he would.

[5:18:17] <ThespianBarrage> I know Vidya Gaems paid for the house Paige's Mom's Daughter lives in.
[5:18:18] <KimilanTV> A lot of the initial problems I had with the game are fixed later on, like most of the story stuff and getting used to the resource management
[5:18:19] <%Niney_Who> Yeyeye original praetor suit
[5:18:20] <WarchiefGoldva> I can't believe the doom slayer died by tripping inside his own house.

[5:19:21] <%doc_ock_rokc> AHAHAHAHAHAHA!
[5:19:22] <NeroInfinite> He already got the suit
[5:19:23] <%CygnusRoboticus> I can't help but think of Bulletstorm where they tried to explain all of the nonsense, where this game seems to NOT EVEN BOTHER TRYING
[5:19:24] <%StaceMcGate> One Guy is now 3 for 3, keep it up
[5:19:24] <MasterTonberry23> Thats cool, but Pat dont need stuff like that! ...Uh does he?
[5:19:24] <jellssssss20> He can't equip it there

[5:19:54] <%rumtumtugnutz> he got it already corp
[5:19:55] <SparkAfterDark> I'm starting to think maybe one guy is actually multiple people. because one guy couldn't possibly be right three times. it doesn't add up
[5:19:58] <tiaramaki> RAW
[5:19:59] <bluebiscuit94> I wonder, how many people playing this game don't know what a floppy disk is becuz they have never seen one?
[5:20:00] <%CygnusRoboticus> I don't think that's a bad thing either
[5:20:01] <+Euphbugg> thats the one

[5:22:20] <TalisKanju> So Animal Crossing got cancelled?
[5:22:20] <%CygnusRoboticus> his base is massive considering it's just for one person
[5:22:21] <Morbidmort> Doom
[5:22:25] <%Corporate_Redeemer> SPOILERS
[5:22:26] <bearking05> old doom probally
[5:22:28] <+silvery_cricket> Who built this ship?
[5:22:32] <Morbidmort> @TalisKanju That was earlier
[5:22:33] <%Ner234> @TalisKanju He played that earlier

[5:22:40] <ScreamLord> @TalisKanju no you missed AC
[5:22:42] <%PhantomMiG> @patstaresat Read the books on the wall
[5:22:43] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @TalisKanju He played that for about three hours a lot earlier.
[5:22:43] <WarchiefGoldva> I figured there'd be a copy of Animal Crossing in his desk or something.
[5:22:45] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt did you use the iddqd
[5:22:45] <SparkAfterDark> I can't believe they got doom running on doom
[5:22:46] <1matheuw> WOW

[5:22:48] <+cinder_chan> the sentinels and the maykrs built it

[5:22:54] <mannywatcha> That's asking alot pat
[5:22:55] <%rumtumtugnutz> @Talis He polayed Animal Crossing for like 3 hours. He just started early.
[5:22:55] <%Corporate_Redeemer> I WOULD PAY FOR THAT
[5:22:56] <NeroInfinite> Iddqd istoo short
[5:22:59] <%D00msDayDan> unlock it as a patch for that game
[5:23:01] <BoneofMalkav> Can Doom Eternal Run Doom? You bet it can!
[5:23:03] <$floralkami> @cygnusroboticus oh yeah, to further defend the level design, apparently there's a GIANT SPIKE going straight through the Earth now.
[5:23:04] <dking0000> I hit it and the game downloaded something after reseting @patstaresat
[5:23:07] <%doc_ock_rokc> @TalisKanju what are you talking about this is animal crossing!
[5:23:13] <%EtheralFlameX> you couldn't beat it because there's no crouch now
[5:23:13] <%Ner234> BANGER ALERT
[5:23:13] <%Valdorick> Test gun
[5:23:14] <%dekkitout> SourPls
[5:23:18] <andrei11dr> That would be crazy
[5:23:21] <rubbishbinge> What if you unlocked Animal Crossing 64
[5:23:23] <Saltmeisterr> SourPls
[5:23:24] <%CygnusRoboticus> @floralkami that's very dwarf fortress so I can approve
[5:23:24] <%BallerSwagBro9k> SourPls
[5:23:25] <tiaramaki> SourPls
[5:23:26] <%rumtumtugnutz> @TalisKanju He polayed Animal Crossing for like 3 hours. He just started early.

[5:23:39] <%tusk102> USE NEW GUN
[5:23:42] <twoto858> BFG Division?
[5:23:43] <Rada150> it be funny if you didn;t complete the game in a certain timeframe it made you beat doom 3 and it's exspansion before you could continue on this game
[5:23:43] <+SinisterBroccoli> Does this game have like an auto aim?
[5:23:45] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Mick FUCKING Gordon
[5:23:48] <SparkAfterDark> I bet doom 2016 would actually kinda suck with these mechanics. Like it'd be insanely easy and feel tiny and boring if you were ripping through it with this level of mobility and heat
[5:23:50] <TioXyco> Animal Eternal e Doom Crossing, nice
[5:23:50] <TalisKanju> Makes sense,
[5:23:51] <+SinisterBroccoli> or magnatism
[5:23:52] <+kapcommunist> sweep da leg, nice
[5:23:53] <KimilanTV> @SinisterBroccoli For controller, yes
[5:23:54] <$floralkami> BFG DIVISION REDUX
[5:23:56] <collind99> YOU DON’T HAVE THE NEW ARMOR ON
[5:23:56] <andrei11dr> I think this has actually a new part to the song
[5:23:57] <%doc_ock_rokc> Forcefiled fuckers are evil....I respect that
[5:24:05] <%TIME_PUNCHER> those things remind me of Jim Sterling memes
[5:24:06] <$floralkami> PAT PUT IT UP
[5:24:06] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @Rada150 That would be so fucked lol
[5:24:09] <%dekkitout> BFG Division Requiem when
[5:24:13] <+kapcommunist> so, not using the new gun?
[5:24:15] <+Pookiedaexzile> Wait wait where are the fat homies
[5:24:18] <Shishi1205> try the balista
[5:24:22] <%doc_ock_rokc> Use gun
[5:24:23] <%valriot> that enemy is Pat mid toilet conversion
[5:24:25] <%Ner234> Gets new gun. DOesn't use it. LUL
[5:24:27] <SparkAfterDark> Like the amount of work it'd take to rebalance 2016 for these mechanics would basically just give you a new game called doom eternal
[5:24:28] <+Pookiedaexzile> Manucuuses have been kinda light
[5:24:33] <hntronium> Railgun?
[5:24:33] <lloyddboy> BEEG ZAPPO

[5:24:44] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt doom 2016 railgun with no charge
[5:24:44] <%StaceMcGate> Big Damage > Do Combo

[5:26:25] <%bigmacjack12> Animal cringing
[5:26:26] <Jakeofalco> Nice glad you did
[5:26:26] <$megamonmon123> its rough man
[5:26:28] <XelGel> @PatStaresAt you get punished for not finding it the 1st time i did the same thing you did]
[5:26:28] <%johnny_gogo> @PatStaresAt you need auto map
[5:26:28] <$floralkami> dig up, stupid
[5:26:29] <TalisKanju> So that means you barely enjoyed Animal Crossing @PatStaresAt
[5:26:30] <ToneBacas> do it
[5:26:30] <%BallerSwagBro9k> YOU NEED FAST TRAVEL POINTS
[5:26:32] <%SoFarFetched> @Bailey__gaming he played animal crossing already
[5:26:32] <%StaceMcGate> Unlike normal fast travel systems, you won't be able to activate fast travel at any given point in Doom Eternal. Instead, you'll need to play through a mission until you are close to the end. Once you reach a certain point, a popup will appear on your screen alerting you to the fact that fast travel has been enabled
[5:26:33] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Bailey__gaming ac is done
[5:26:33] <+Pookiedaexzile> Sdlp looks liek you gotta do the next mission
[5:26:34] <person181> just do it again pan
[5:26:36] <KatabolicRage> cheats turn slayer gates off
[5:26:41] <SomeAsianDood> ^
[5:26:41] <SparkAfterDark> Watch it take you like 2 minutes to tear ass through it and get back there tho
[5:26:43] <LoboJoe> Speedrun time
[5:26:44] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt Shoulda done it the first time
[5:26:45] <%Maids4lyfe> you can't use cheats to do slayer gates
[5:26:46] <%D00msDayDan> you can't tho, you can't access slayer gates with cheats on
[5:26:47] <%machshop> big cheats
[5:26:49] <+fizzguy47> This is the 2nd Gate, right?
[5:26:49] <ImmaCanuck> YEYEYE BIG CHEAT
[5:26:50] <hntronium> Didn't he get an automap?
[5:26:52] <Nina96> well time to book it
[5:26:54] <lloyddboy> 3
[5:26:57] <%Maids4lyfe> YOU CAN'T USE CHEATS IT LOCKS THE GATE

[5:27:08] <ToneBacas> it takes 5 minutes man
[5:27:08] <%TIME_PUNCHER> Pat why the FUCK did you listen to us??
[5:27:09] <SparkAfterDark> Oh no now you have to play more Doom!
[5:27:14] <%CygnusRoboticus> @StaceMcGate reasonable in a real gameplay scenario, but horrible for streams
[5:27:20] <hntronium> Can you just use cheats to the gate and then disable the cheats?
[5:27:21] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt did you use the iddqd cheat code yet?
[5:27:23] <+fizzguy47> Oh, more Doom, what a pain in the ass
[5:27:28] <yeetdabsenpai69> NEVER listen to chat hivemind
[5:27:28] <%SoFarFetched> Always,sometimes,never listen to Chat LUL
[5:27:31] <%Valdorick> Does if you're PRO
[5:27:32] <JorgenTheElf> Time to slow travel
[5:27:35] <TalisKanju> End it
[5:27:36] <%CygnusRoboticus> why does the map have difference colors!
[5:27:36] <Monkeyweed21> it does if you're good
[5:27:38] <%depressed_skeleton> Just five gamer minutes
[5:27:41] <%D00msDayDan> to be fair these levels go a LOT faster when you're not scraping for secrets
[5:27:46] <KatabolicRage> your hands ARE different
[5:27:46] <fabo_joyful> Raid plague!
[5:27:49] <%SoFarFetched> kinda
[5:27:50] <%Valdorick> Bitch can't even see his feet
[5:27:51] <KatabolicRage> go do glory kills you'll see
[5:27:52] <Shishi1205> you can see his hands
[5:27:53] <$floralkami> @cygnusroboticus to make it easier to read
[5:27:55] <XelGel> @PatStaresAt just for the cutscenes
[5:27:59] <%PhantomMiG> @patstaresat There is an easter egg on doomguys book shelf
[5:28:00] <+cinder_chan> thats def not the same hands you crazy person
[5:28:04] <%TIME_PUNCHER> Always sometimes chat's wrong
[5:28:06] <%Jolnir> WOAH DIFFERENT SKIN IN A SINGLE PLAYER GAME WOOOAAAH?AHAHAH
[5:28:07] <$floralkami> punch something
[5:28:07] <j0ustar> There are only so many variants of M E T A L Pat
[5:28:09] <arkv01> thats kinda how it is with FPSes
[5:28:09] <ScreamLord> It's for Cutscenes that show the whole Doomguy
[5:28:09] <+HoloMeylan> The Twitch Prime skin is definitely the best one
[5:28:12] <%DedlokPM> yeah your hands do look different
[5:28:16] <+wjones0415> wouldnt know, cant see your body.
[5:28:17] <%CygnusRoboticus> @floralkami but then I get confused about FOUR COLORS on the map!
[5:28:21] <Shishi1205> try to get the unicorn one
[5:28:21] <Ipsenscastle> They are different, your forearms had hedgehog spikes before
[5:28:21] <%doc_ock_rokc> Night pat
[5:28:22] <andrei11dr> In cutscenes you'll see the costume @patstaresat
[5:28:23] <SubjectTea> BIG STREAM
[5:28:26] <hntronium> Nah, just one

[5:28:36] <fakkuza> good night!
[5:28:38] <+fizzguy47> Did you see the rabbit in one of the levels?
[5:28:39] <tiaramaki> Alright, it was fun! See ya, guys
[5:28:39] <%rumtumtugnutz> gota go poop
[5:28:39] <%CygnusRoboticus> though the map in this game is amazing
[5:28:42] <hntronium> PLAY ANIMAL CROSSING WHILE READING DONOS
[5:28:42] <%StaceMcGate> Each level is around two hours
[5:28:43] <+KilogramHours> Did he play Animal Crossing today chat?
[5:28:43] <%CygnusRoboticus> colors or not
[5:28:43] <$floralkami> @cygnusroboticus pretty sure there is a key legend for that, lol
[5:28:52] <$joylent_blue> yep KilogramHours for like 3 hours
[5:28:57] <hntronium> @KilogramHours He big did
[5:28:59] <%TIME_PUNCHER> Pat Pees At Doom Eternal
[5:29:03] <%StaceMcGate> @KilogramHours he did, he enjoy it but is still unsure why he enjoyed it
[5:29:10] <$floralkami> @cygnusroboticus lol, it was one of the first things Pat was like "YEAAAAH" for
[5:29:11] <+fizzguy47> we can watcb Plague after this stream
[5:29:14] <%CygnusRoboticus> @floralkami I assume so, pat is my only exposure to this game so I'm sure my view is shitty so far
[5:29:22] <TalisKanju> Time to watch Pat suffer through Animal Crossing on the replay
[5:29:37] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @CygnusRoboticus Plague of Gripes is streaming it now too
[5:29:42] <hntronium> @CygnusRoboticus I'm the absolute opposite of you, this game looks amazing
[5:29:47] <andrei11dr> Wait Plague is still streaming?Holy crap
[5:29:48] <%CygnusRoboticus> AW SHIT
[5:29:59] <%CygnusRoboticus> gotta switch to the furry creeper
[5:30:01] <$floralkami> yeah, let's go watch Plague so we can dunk on his flimsy grasp of the mechanics
[5:30:05] <hntronium> @andrei11dr Not still, he stopped and started back up later
[5:30:17] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Let's tell Pat so he can Raid the wrong guy again
[5:30:25] <hntronium> @floralkami Watching plague play this was terrible
[5:30:25] <%CygnusRoboticus> hopefully pat raids so I can feel like I'm doing my part as a "supporter"
[5:30:33] <andrei11dr> Im pretty sure he's way further in the game
[5:30:35] <hntronium> He thought loot magnet wasn't good
[5:30:41] <hntronium> @andrei11dr Nope
[5:31:00] <$floralkami> @hntronium wait, what? in a game where your constantly bobbing and weaving?
[5:31:13] <$floralkami> Plague, why?
[5:31:37] <%CygnusRoboticus> @andrei11dr I don't think I'll actually buy eternal, so I hope he's futher so I can be confused at every step
[5:32:10] <hntronium> He doesn't think any of those upgrades were good. Its like watching pat being wrong about things but even worse
[5:32:28] <trianglehat> thank you for numbers
[5:32:30] <King_Wolf_Rigger> By worse you meant better, right?
[5:32:32] <hntronium> PLAGUE
