[0:23:15] <%rumtumtugnutz> paige won't be mad about being called a slum redhead. she'll pretend, but she wears that white trash badge proud.
[0:23:15] <%NovaKnightmare> this is is cool looking screen tho
[0:23:18] <+Overlordkain> materia first, every time
[0:23:18] <+PlagueOfGripes> I think we're in sort of the same general place. Was going to stream more today but I'm also exhausted
[0:23:23] <depressioncherrie> It's weird and unnecessary tbh
[0:23:23] <%furiousfurioso> you can just set it to auto

[0:24:08] <%JohnAtDawn> Yeah I like that they tried to make you keep the Buster Sword but this is not my favorite thing so far.

[0:24:22] <Mobilebeardunit> OH, cos it stops at Midgar exit
[0:24:22] <Theonlypegsus> I know why they wouldn't do it but I'd have loved to have Jessie and the gang in your party in this game.
[0:24:23] <Shishi1205> so we are missing aerith
[0:24:25] <Ravenian96> Chat will be permanently horny during this playthrough

[0:25:14] <%TheMattman1313> AND Wedge, Jess, and Biggs are NOT in the party
[0:25:18] <%Daniel_Is_I> Would Pat have even used summons outside of bosses?
[0:25:19] <%passthehanky> i summoned carbuncle in a regular one, tho
[0:25:21] <Angry_Ev1L> I hope they expand it in part 2 (that will never come out)
[0:25:27] <%aslfrasle> It cuts down on Knights of the Round running that cutscene every fight.
[0:25:28] <+CelioHogane> @LozsCat is like a gas, but sometimes is liquid
[0:25:31] <%JohnAtDawn> OH WAIT
[0:25:31] <Tha_Mik> You would use a summon on a rat monster
[0:25:34] <%TheActuallyGuy> THEY TRY TO MAKE SUMMONS SPECIAL. I'M OK WITH IT. BUT I SEE WHY PEOPLE ARE DISAPPOINTED.
[0:25:35] <+IrishWeegee> makes sense to not summon gods for rats and dogs

[0:32:29] <%rumtumtugnutz> you know, I really don't get why people are here just to complain about the game.
[0:32:33] <%barrakuta371> Scan the purple ones
[0:32:34] <%RedKnightVI> Assess the enigmatic spectre
[0:32:36] <Blank9> FUCK OFF, GHOSTS
[0:32:42] <%aslfrasle> ASSESS THE ENIGMATIC SPECTER
[0:32:42] <%AllenDeadman> asses it

[0:32:45] <jobbedbone> looks like we need some Ghostbusters 2016 up in here
[0:32:45] <ralphfromdk> shiny_prinny Nah, wouldn't make sense that aerith would be able to see them back when you met her :l

[0:32:53] <Shishi1205> great my internet died for like 2 minutes

[0:32:54] <%Bane_Kaikyo> I got here kinda late, what'd I miss? Why are there so many G H O S T S?
[0:32:58] <hassanico2> Chat the fuck is going on, last I was here he went to bed?!
[0:33:04] <shiny_prinny> @ralphfromdk that's true i forgot about that
[0:33:07] <%VritraReiRei> @rumtumtugnutz those are the people that think, "THEY RUINED MY CHILDHOOD"
[0:33:09] <%LandOfTheWay> @Bane_Kaikyo we don't know yet
[0:33:10] <framewindowcleaner> To everyine that doesn't get why people hate this so much - YOU WILL
[0:33:10] <Frostydough1> Fucking dementors

[0:33:17] <+Suplexsenpai> Ghost BUSTER
[0:33:17] <%collind99> EXPECTO PATRONUS
[0:33:22] <+ojama1987> @ralphfromdk you're arguing semantics. Re-make implies they re-made the game over. It doesn't really imply that its a totally different game with the same characters in it.
[0:33:23] <Alseid> must resist urge to explain these
[0:33:23] <jobbedbone> number defeated 0
[0:33:29] <%suikudo> @hassanico2 you didnt miss anything he wakes up to tifa telling him the slums are under attack

[0:33:36] <%ape_hawk> defeat the dementors to stop the SUPER dementor
[0:33:39] <tjplat> what if this is actually kingdom hearts 4 and we got bamboozled by square enix?
[0:33:41] <+Parlux> @Bane_Kaikyo you didn't miss much pat just started cloud woke up to this shit
[0:33:41] <Angry_Ev1L> @framewindowcleaner < he is right you know...
[0:33:41] <devil_may_cum_> Music is great
[0:33:43] <hassanico2> @suikudo @hntronium thanks you two
[0:33:46] <%Guardiansaiyan> @hassanico2 new stuff WE DON'T KNOW!!!
[0:33:47] <de1ete_forever> worst. dream sequence. ever
[0:33:51] <Theonlypegsus> Defeat the evil palpatines
[0:33:57] <%sniffy77> Punch ghost
[0:33:59] <%aishman> @PatStaresAt You know what would help in a moment where you are literally surrounded by ghosts? A summon.
[0:34:02] <%timetraveller2000> Punch those ghosts PunOko
[0:34:02] <%Partialrecall2> hell yeah get that camera on tifa right tf now
[0:34:04] <%WhereIsWill> crazy damage
[0:34:06] <LuxyDoodle> @Bane_Kaikyo Cloud woke up and this invasion was already underway
[0:34:07] <%Daniel_Is_I> ITEM USED
[0:34:07] <%Movemeister> Punch that ghost honkers
[0:34:08] <%the38bandit> Best Girl
[0:34:10] <+Dio_Goodguy> remember when the Midgar section had the perfect pacing
[0:34:16] <%thegreenbenis> Jessie is best girl
[0:34:17] <+Parlux> summon ifrit
[0:34:23] <%Daniel_Is_I> Can't summon
[0:34:24] <%suikudo> Got any ether?
[0:34:25] <%solzan2000> I like new shit, making the game exactly the same and adding nothing is wack asf
[0:34:25] <%hntronium> Can he summon Ifrit? I can
[0:34:26] <+BubbaRands> jesus Tifa's movie like she's on Gary's Mod LUL
[0:34:27] <Chester_goes_Berserk> dat tifa pose
[0:34:29] <%Partialrecall2> fatty ghost tornadoes
[0:34:31] <%hntronium> I can't see if he can
[0:34:31] <%PhysicsLB> kill regular spectres to make it vulnerable
[0:34:38] <%ape_hawk> pat, you must stop the Energetic Sphincter!
[0:34:41] <%BoomerUnchained> "Yes, this totally fits" -Nomura
[0:34:42] <%Daniel_Is_I> There's no summon gauge
[0:34:43] <%aishman> @Daniel_Is_I Oh I know, it's just funny how the game deems this moment NOT HARD ENOUGH for the summon to stirr
[0:34:44] <%VritraReiRei> *Can* he summon right now?
[0:34:44] <%suikudo> magic
[0:34:44] <jobbedbone> a summon would be real clutch right now
[0:34:48] <@commanderclaw> "Hey, that's MY twink!"
[0:34:52] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Holy shit people are complaining so much wtf
[0:34:54] <devil_may_cum_> Ik the new shit has been great so far, I don’t know what’s so bad about this
[0:34:55] <+Mitchellsocks> Can't believe Nomura worked Organization XIII into this
[0:35:02] <+lethallylactic> Summons are apparently locked to certain fights?
[0:35:03] <ralphfromdk> Parlux Summons only work when the summon it self thinks its a battle worth fighting in. This is not one of them i guess
[0:35:09] <hassanico2> @XeroSigmaPrime It's a deviation in a remake, what do ya expect
[0:35:09] <%tumzfestival> Swing you rbig sword, Dad
[0:35:13] <%solzan2000> its final fantasy people are gonna complain no matter what
[0:35:16] <framewindowcleaner> What is it with Nomura and black cloacks? LUL
[0:35:18] <+Suplexsenpai> BIG backseats
[0:35:19] <+michingmallecho> People this is a remake. It’s separate from the original. Chill...chilll psaUp
[0:35:25] <%NovaKnightmare> You fight Native American ghosts in the original game for fuck's sake
[0:35:28] <+love_otter> Pat just focus enigmatic the other ones don't stop coming
[0:35:30] <%Daniel_Is_I> At least the cloaks aren't made of belts.
[0:35:34] <%Partialrecall2> Remember the correct sequence of Claps and Bows or use an edged weapon to Sever Ties to This World
[0:35:35] <%aishman> I love how Ifrit stirrs for two robots but a LITERAL GHOST TORNADO he's like "Naw you got this fam."
[0:35:36] <%rumtumtugnutz> it's almost like this is a new Final Fantasy game.
[0:35:37] <%BoomerUnchained> No, I refuse psaDown
[0:35:40] <%CursedNobleman> This is just like my Beyond Two Souls
[0:35:40] <jobbedbone> we waited 20 years for harry potter fantasy 6
[0:35:40] <hassanico2> NICE DAMAGE!
[0:35:41] <%ape_hawk> "okay, our dad is gone, lets bail"
[0:35:42] <powerprotoman> so glad nomura added evil condoms
[0:35:42] <chambatron> Wait this sequence is not a dream right?
[0:35:43] <+lethallylactic> LUL
[0:35:46] <+Parlux> @ralphfromdk makes sense. That doesn't bother me I played FFX on how limited summons were
[0:35:46] <Nupinoop296> Pat
[0:35:46] <%tumzfestival> SO MANY HEARTS ITS CRAZY
[0:35:48] <%Movemeister> WutFace
[0:35:51] <xanderfist> why are there dementors this ain't harry potter
[0:35:52] <@commanderclaw> Both the perky and the jiggly are mine!
[0:35:53] <BinaryShuffle> Oh shit, they actually use ammo and not compressed aether or something
[0:35:53] <Dr_Mooose> rip
[0:35:57] <%weissguard> Ifrit looks at the Soulnado and is like *YAWN*

[0:42:55] <%SoFarFetched> @Ixiah Unless Pat said "Hey here's a link to buy this game and some money will go to me" then No.
[0:42:57] <ralphfromdk> Diddley dodge :D
[0:43:01] <+tigerfang86> HEELOR

[0:43:09] <+BubbaRands> Barret the white mage LUL
[0:43:09] <$valkuma> barret heals the planet
[0:43:10] <%BoomerUnchained> Ah, now this is the nostalgic part
[0:43:10] <Chester_goes_Berserk> 98% of the game is a fantastic rpg
[0:43:13] <%rytyoung> WHUT I HATE BEING A MEDIC
[0:43:16] <+CelioHogane> @MoraMiarty I will asume that it's so you can use all weapons for the entire game, if you like one more.
[0:43:16] <LuxyDoodle> @Futurecity10 That isn't even close to realistic and you know it.
[0:43:21] <%Partialrecall2> "last final fantasy" is a bit redundant....
[0:43:21] <BoneofMalkav> And you will be a Pat
[0:43:22] <%Djinnazz> That Chakra shit is hella good.
[0:43:22] <%MonsterEnvy> You have three accessories so why not give her one.
[0:43:31] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> Make the black man the white mage, huh? I see how it is
[0:43:31] <%Partialrecall2> she doesnt deserve it
[0:43:33] <%trueherobappo> what about the other 2%
[0:43:41] <42nfl19> revival is one time
[0:43:41] <%Ixiah> does this game still have the ALL materia ? or can i attack or heal more than one without it ?
[0:43:42] <Parapattern> Is it better than Peggle 2? No.
[0:43:43] <%AllenDeadman> you can go buy a new accesory tho
[0:43:44] <%tumzfestival> dont wanna use the bead
[0:43:45] <%BoomerUnchained> Just buy her one
[0:43:46] <%OneGorillionDollars> 5Head
[0:43:49] <%coreyyotto> Becaue memes
[0:43:50] <$valkuma> If you put the revival bead on Aerith she cant die to sephiroth
[0:43:50] <%Guardiansaiyan> IRONY
[0:43:51] <%optimasmaximas> cause it's fitting
[0:43:51] <%LandOfTheWay> cause he's a CLOUD
[0:43:51] <+Parlux> 43 damage. Jesus Tifa hits so hard
[0:43:52] <%MonsterEnvy> Oh I did not know it was one time
[0:43:52] <+CelioHogane> BOOOOOO!
[0:43:52] <@commanderclaw> Cause he's cool lightning
[0:43:53] <SomersaultJustice> because he is lightning
[0:43:54] <%SummonerMagno> thunderhead
[0:43:55] <$lotharrio> Because Cloud with lightning is CANON!
[0:43:55] <%Ixiah> hes better lightning ?
[0:43:55] <hassanico2> Oh he's having mind goblins over the Revival Bead and treating it like a consumable item isn't he?
[0:43:56] <+tigerfang86> cause CLOUD
[0:43:56] <%TheActuallyGuy> CAUSE HE'S A CLOUD
[0:43:56] <+BubbaRands> CAUSE OF THE HAIR 4Head

[0:43:57] <%MisterRockett> SOILDER BOLT
[0:43:59] <%Guardiansaiyan> call him LIGHT
[0:43:59] <%SilvaChariot0133> "It's a surpise tool that will help us later!"
[0:44:00] <%Partialrecall2> clouds and lightning go together
[0:44:00] <Mobilebeardunit> totally not a waifu dress up game. Waifu Equip game? maybe...
[0:44:00] <%trueherobappo> Thunderhead
[0:44:01] <%UvBenServed> Cause ff13 is your favorite
[0:44:01] <%SH1NK1R0> All materia is now magnify materia
[0:44:01] <hat_under_bread> Because he looks like Pikachu
[0:44:01] <%MonsterEnvy> Cause of Lighting in clouds

[0:44:07] <CuttleCrow> YELLOW = LIGHTNING
[0:44:09] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> that's my Otp Cloud and Lightning
[0:44:10] <+Overlordkain> Put revival on someone and keep it on an active person best you can, it will save you some grind later. 5k to level it up
[0:44:11] <%king_wragles> @PatStaresAt He's a Storm Cloud!
[0:44:11] <%CursedNobleman> Chrono had lightning and he was protag LUL

[0:44:20] <Chester_goes_Berserk> other 2% is maaaaan, nomura needs an editor bad
[0:44:20] <devil_may_cum_> Inb4 lighting makes a cameo in this
[0:44:21] <illTemperedSeaBass> Lightning is strife of cloud.

[0:45:03] <de1ete_forever> Pat Stares At (Final)
[0:45:03] <transporterthesequel> You’re right, Lightning IS the main character
[0:45:09] <%valkuma> valkuma subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months! Save the revival bead so you can put it on Aerif right before Seppy stabs her that way you get the true ending.

[0:47:02] <Fep3> this is before brothel right?
[0:47:05] <WarchiefGoldva> I want to eat Chadley while he screams for his pathetic Nomura-given life.
[0:47:09] <iggeh> i can't believe they named him Chadley
[0:47:12] <+Parlux> THE virgin chadley
[0:47:23] <Mobilebeardunit> We all know a chadley
[0:47:24] <%CursedNobleman> NEEEEERD
[0:47:26] <+CelioHogane> @Fep3 nooope, about to do the second sector
[0:47:31] <ralphfromdk> Yes, Cloud has yet to be a pretty little princess if they still do it in this game
[0:47:34] <%Partialrecall2> chadley and his queen, bethany
[0:47:34] <%WhereIsWill> nothing lol
[0:47:35] <depressioncherrie> He's like a chad-let
[0:47:35] <+love_otter> Looks more like a Chetly
[0:47:37] <%rytyoung> @johnatdawn It's all good, would've been surprised if it did work haha
[0:47:38] <Fep3> ok
[0:47:38] <Dr_Mooose> chump change
[0:47:39] <%arancet> i hate this little shit so much
[0:47:41] <$Piemono> listen he slams puss and he's a dork
[0:47:42] <+Suplexsenpai> Give him a wedgy
[0:47:44] <%Frost_Quill> Might get more expensive the more you do it.
[0:47:47] <+Overlordkain> Autocure isnt as useful as it sounds btw, it still requires mp and ATB, so its just saving you from pressing the botton yourself is all
[0:47:50] <TimetodiveLTX> as all skill tree resets should
[0:47:53] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> That's pretty convenient
[0:48:16] <transporterthesequel> The Virgin CHADley
[0:48:18] <de1ete_forever> Chadley is a power bottom
[0:48:19] <hassanico2> By the way apparently Ryuji and Anne's VAs are also in this game
[0:48:20] <+CelioHogane> If it's this cheap, why even have it locked to begin with?
[0:48:28] <CuttleCrow> VIRGN cloud, wearing DARK clothes, talks quietly, tries to be COOL. CHADly, wears BRIGHT clothes, makes his materia, stands PROUDLY in the middle of the slums
[0:48:32] <%PhysicsLB> so reseting the points keeps the unlocked cores?
[0:48:33] <%tumzfestival> yo Pat smoke any fat dank lately?
[0:48:35] <%PhysicsLB> interesting
[0:48:56] <ralphfromdk> So, what does linked materia do?
[0:48:58] <%Partialrecall2> the only one who's giving tifa materia is Chadley
[0:49:00] <@commanderclaw> Lucky Tifa
[0:49:05] <bestwaifuritsu> Oh boy!
[0:49:07] <iggeh> she is trying to get lucky
[0:49:11] <%Frost_Quill> Lucky Knuckles
[0:49:25] <%PhysicsLB> Tifa is such a beast in battle honestly
[0:49:29] <+tigerfang86> I'm SHOCKED
[0:49:29] <Tha_Mik> Nice
[0:49:36] <Mobilebeardunit> a lot of time and programming effort went into Somebody Giving Tifa Something
[0:49:40] <%rytyoung> It's siiiick
[0:49:41] <%tumzfestival> Satisfying :)
[0:49:41] <+CelioHogane> IT'S THE BEST
[0:49:42] <CuttleCrow> IT DOES THOUGH
[0:49:42] <%WhereIsWill> its rad af
[0:49:43] <hot4dukat> It's pretty cool though
[0:49:46] <+BubbaRands> BUT ITS SOOO GOOD
[0:49:46] <+necrocannibal2> it's awesome
[0:49:46] <%valkuma> Its really good
[0:49:47] <%VritraReiRei> I love that you can see it on cutscenes too!
[0:49:50] <%ospreyworks> Did Cloud get the chance to visit Jessie’s place while her roommates were out?
[0:49:50] <%JumbleJams> IT'S SO COOOOOL
[0:49:50] <hat_under_bread> It's also really easy to program with the engine.
[0:49:54] <+Suplexsenpai> BIG good
[0:49:57] <%BonewheelVanguard> is Luck like crit chance or something?
[0:49:58] <transporterthesequel> Tifa is, canonically, the strongest human on earth
[0:50:02] <%valkuma> Its such a simple change too
[0:50:09] <agustorm123> Is goooda
[0:50:09] <Malisin_Murder> Materieolas
[0:50:09] <%KaiserMario> That's right Jay!
[0:50:10] <%SH1NK1R0> Luck is crit and steal rate
[0:50:11] <%tumzfestival> ladies and their glerves
[0:50:13] <%PanicSwytch> Also any weapon u have equipped appear on cutscenes
[0:50:17] <KasiCrafter> Meteri-Os
[0:50:18] <+necrocannibal2> besides the two huge materias on her chest
[0:50:19] <bestwaifuritsu> Tifa's Huge Materia LUL

[0:50:32] <%Frost_Quill> STAMP TALK
[0:50:34] <%Partialrecall2> im sick of viewable weapons and equipment and cosmetics being considered afterthoughts. should be the damn rewards for the game, not cash shop purchases
[0:50:36] <%barrakuta371> I like how the weapons and materia carry over inn the cutscenes. Not a lot of games I've seen do that lately.
[0:50:39] <%PhysicsLB> well cutscenes are made with in game models aren't they? makes sense
[0:50:40] <+tigerfang86> CRIT ME TIFI
[0:50:40] <%KasiCrafter> @tizz86 Thanks for the gift sub!
[0:50:43] <Theonlypegsus> @PatStaresAt Its a pull but It kinda reminds me of like in Dead space with the Health bars on their backs on their gear. I loved that shit so much.

[1:19:43] <+necrocannibal2> this game seems pretty linear, FFX-esque
[1:19:44] <%Guardiansaiyan> @GarbageNirvana thats song is more like Hoes Dank de Chocobo

[1:21:35] <+Koush> Oney is just a who
[1:21:35] <peanutdot007> Shinra probably doesn't give its guards any food. They just recruit new ones.
[1:21:36] <%VritraReiRei> Those are WERE-Rats, clearly they are stronger!
[1:21:37] <+SaltyGhostRock> Its a rat eat guard world out here
[1:21:37] <ScreamLord> What did Oney say about FF7?
[1:21:38] <%BoomerUnchained> Cause Pat never has bad takes LUL
[1:21:40] <FlamingoJazz> Oney is bleh
[1:21:43] <availablethor> I it the rats that are strong, or the guards that are weak?

[1:22:09] <%Futurecity10> Plague is also pretty pissed off at the game
[1:22:25] <%rumtumtugnutz> any kind of respect I had for him was lost when he said that people should be allowed to be racist and sexist on the internet because it's all in good fun.
[1:22:26] <%thegreenbenis> @Futurecity10 What about?

[1:32:13] <Explodincatz> didnt limit break :(
[1:32:15] <%cowardman93> yes they are explained in FF7 world
[1:32:16] <%Movemeister> This is like those old Deaf Fantasy videos Monty Oum used to make ;_;
[1:32:19] <LeaIsChill> The only good part of 13
[1:32:20] <%Koush> The gameplay is completely solid start to finish.
[1:32:22] <Zombrocom> That's too real
[1:32:22] <%ape_hawk> yeah, it was one of the only good things from FFXIII
[1:32:23] <WarchiefGoldva> She's hitting like a freight train, holy shit.
[1:32:24] <de1ete_forever> bad corporation, good to ur room

[1:32:51] <MaritimeSpanker> Shame it's all a corridor
[1:32:54] <Zombrocom> This section feels very 13
[1:33:00] <%weissguard> Tifa is supposed to be one of the strongest hand-to-hand fighters in canon, isn't she?
[1:33:01] <+Superbro64> 13-3 music tho is pretty incredible
[1:33:04] <%Fenrirlives> 13 has cool Summons!
[1:33:06] <NiktenKing> that strings section in 13 was so good
[1:33:06] <Shishi1205> nice
[1:33:07] <%kingbaconcrispy> My feelings almost exactly about 13.
[1:33:11] <%j0ustar> XIII is a no-fun slog and a half
[1:33:12] <%solzan2000> FF13 series music is 10/10
[1:33:16] <%weissguard> *in FFVII canon, I mean.

[1:39:01] <Nupinoop296> those mines... i'm weirdly nostalgic
[1:39:08] <%PanicSwytch> FF12 had mimics
[1:39:09] <%GarbageNirvana> @Guardiansaiyan After stream I got work
[1:39:09] <%j0ustar> FF XII was boring
[1:39:10] <%Movemeister> Stampo
[1:39:11] <%Guardiansaiyan> @framewindowcleaner the ramaster music sounds good tho
[1:39:15] <devil_may_cum_> @framewindowcleaner Bro you just have bad opinions lol
[1:39:17] <%Guardiansaiyan> @GarbageNirvana we can wait
[1:39:17] <+CelioHogane> 24 hours!
[1:39:18] <framewindowcleaner> @necrocannibal2 I dare you to remember most music from dungeons in that game
[1:39:18] <%hntronium> nice
[1:39:19] <%Ultimatefool> This whole area was 5 repeating screens before, talk about an expansion

[1:39:22] <%optimasmaximas> yea
[1:39:24] <%ape_hawk> until pat needs to be changed
[1:39:24] <+LordSDB> F12 is great!
[1:39:26] <%trustycoyote> Brain Huice
[1:39:26] <@commanderclaw> How does Paige do it then?
[1:39:27] <Shishi1205> LET THE BASS
[1:39:28] <broostmonkey> just eat some sugar to refuel
[1:39:30] <%trustycoyote> Juice*
[1:39:33] <%doc_ock_rokc> so in a miniute then
[1:39:36] <%Guardiansaiyan> @framewindowcleaner I liked Eryut Village theme...
[1:39:36] <MaritimeSpanker> 12 plays great. It's my second FF game, right after 9 at number 1.
[1:39:36] <+BubbaRands> Eating something sweet might help
[1:39:39] <%WhereIsWill> brain: im running on FUMES!
[1:39:42] <dmian07> Just do drugs
[1:39:43] <%pynkdoe> smooth brain
[1:39:45] <%abusywizard> I own FFXII and the only thing I know about it is that it looks like the Star Wars prequels
[1:39:49] <%Yummy_Nukes> @patstaresat is the buster sword still worth using?
[1:39:50] <+necrocannibal2> @framewindowcleaner I do, Phon Coast is my favorite lol
[1:39:51] <%realm_forge> FILL THE ORB WITH CAFFEINE
[1:39:54] <+Parlux> Oh yeah its big brain time
[1:39:57] <nyacoo> Pat's brain hates FF7 confirmed
[1:40:01] <%KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt Hey Pat this games is pretty great, but is there anything you fear it could do to ruin it?
[1:40:01] <%abusywizard> Never touched it tho
[1:40:03] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Not rly
[1:40:06] <framewindowcleaner> @Guardiansaiyan There's some highlights, but the dungeon music is really dull and repetitive
[1:40:09] <myriad_truth> I wish I had an item that made me IMMUNE TO POISON
[1:40:10] <%joylent_blue> yes ffxii is basically star wars, its great
[1:40:11] <TheHotStuven> HOLy thats a nice detail
[1:40:13] <shiny_prinny> a lot of the FFXII Zodiac Age improvements had some flaws
[1:40:16] <%BallerSwagBro9k> i can play for 48hrs nonstop
[1:40:25] <+necrocannibal2> from what I've heard all weapons are viable for endgame
[1:40:27] <+LordSDB> But for anyone who hasn't played 12, don't overuse gambits, you will kill the gameplay for yourself
[1:40:30] <@commanderclaw> Baller, that's not healthy
[1:40:31] <$lotharrio> ...wait do you still level up in a normal way?
[1:40:32] <Shishi1205> that posion inmune thing woulb be busted in Dokapon
[1:40:43] <%j0ustar> I remember buying the metal box collectors edition of FFXII... traded it in once I finished it I was disappointed as hell
[1:40:45] <zakaraz> "theres only so much brain power you can give before your brain starts to depower" sounds like the words of a man on low power
[1:40:52] <+Superbro64> @ballerswagbro9k you're crazy and I dont believe you
[1:40:53] <MaritimeSpanker> Zodiac Age on steam is the best version of 12 to date, and I highly recommend it to anyone interested in it. Has tons of fun side-quest stuff - even a mini-Mon-Hun type style of game!
[1:40:57] <Mobilebeardunit> worth getting FF12 remaster on the switch, you reckon?
[1:41:00] <%Hellarussian> yeah?
[1:41:01] <+tigerfang86> WOW
[1:41:01] <%optimasmaximas> ohhhh
[1:41:04] <42nfl19> MONEY
[1:41:05] <Nupinoop296> oooh
[1:41:05] <Dr_Mooose> wow
[1:41:06] <%optimasmaximas> that'ssick
[1:41:06] <+Parlux> What other final fantasy plays like this, thats not kingdom hearts and is worth playing?
[1:41:07] <xxmagonx> oooh
[1:41:07] <Zombrocom> Ok?
[1:41:07] <TheHotStuven> YEYEYEYE
[1:41:08] <myriad_truth> Cool!

[1:41:12] <%Yummy_Nukes> awesome

[1:41:18] <cureneckbeard> yeyeye
[1:41:18] <%JumbleJams> PogChamp
[1:41:20] <+BubbaRands> OOOOOOOOO THATS NOT NEEDED BUT IM GLAD ITS THERE
[1:41:22] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Someone was thinking when they put htis together.
[1:41:22] <framewindowcleaner> @j0ustar FFXII was made by the Tactics Ogre guy until he quit. You can tell the immediate quality drop where he left
[1:41:23] <%joylent_blue> eh, i found a lot of the fun in XII being in figuring out how to best optimize the gambits, it was like a puzzle
[1:41:25] <asurite_warrior> That's not hard to do
[1:41:26] <+SundanceShot> this game is okay
[1:41:26] <%maenos2> Bedazzle cloud's sword
[1:41:28] <%KaiserMario> I gotta say, the lighting they do really make this game pop! Looks great
[1:41:30] <Shishi1205> SPECEIST
[1:41:31] <Ipsenscastle> @Parlux none, it's a new system
[1:41:33] <nzrai> But i unironically love letting gambits play for me
[1:41:34] <+necrocannibal2> the FF12 remastered ruined the percussion in the music, though, which is probably why some of you think it's boring
[1:41:36] <%trustycoyote> Unnecessary but very much appreciated detail
[1:41:36] <+LordSDB> @Mobilebeardunit Yeah its worth it if you can't buy it on sale for pc
[1:41:36] <Nupinoop296> i feel Barrett there actually
[1:41:38] <%honeyman18> psaDown_SG

[2:40:37] <RichochetForce> Yeah, having elemental melee strikes would be great.
[2:40:39] <guts32> Long time fans hate this game because apparently they changed something about the story and it's not the full story in this game
[2:40:39] <Fep3> Affected
[2:40:55] <%cervidaequus> @illtemperedseabass american woman, paige tweeted art recently
[2:40:59] <%Yummy_Nukes> TWO people have become ONE person, almost like they're married or something
[2:41:00] <+CelioHogane> @guts32 shhh...
[2:41:10] <+Dorf1> the element materia was in a trailer and it had a miniscule effect on damage
[2:41:18] <+Neoripo> Pat is going MNK
[2:41:21] <%doc_ock_rokc> Hey Pat. What is paige's stand name? Is it [American Woman]? or something else?

[2:41:45] <%BoomerUnchained> PAige
[2:41:45] <ミュウレ4242> they changed truck loads about the story. might as well call it ff7 kiwami.
[2:41:46] <%SoFarFetched> PAIGE STOP CUTTING YOURSELF
[2:41:47] <%optimasmaximas> LUL paige cut again?
[2:41:49] <Shishi1205> Do not laugh @PatStaresAt
[2:41:50] <$Dakuu75> lol, pat has all 3 characters at level 15

[2:41:55] <+necrocannibal2> my crew is big and it keeps getting bigger
[2:41:59] <heartlesshealer> I thought Paige was sunglasses at night or something with blindness. Is there official lore?
[2:41:59] <%cervidaequus> @maritimespanker he said yea, after the marchapril slam of releases is over
[2:41:59] <WarchiefGoldva> Did Paige cut off her finger again?

[2:42:23] <%bread_assassin> Anyone know what the crosshairs on the name mean?
[2:42:24] <herrcepo> I know it won't happen, but I wish they'd remake XV in this new system.
[2:42:27] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> wAT
[2:42:28] <+UnwoundCaesar70> @necrocannibal2 that's cause jesus christ is my....
[2:42:32] <%JohnAtDawn> That feels backwards right?
[2:42:34] <%Futurecity10> it just works
[2:42:34] <%Djinnazz> just use 10 abilities
[2:42:34] <%nobodybutalex> Unique abilities are the triangle attacks
[2:42:36] <cosmicgoatee> Paige and Sharp objects what could go wrong Kappa
[2:42:37] <Shishi1205> I tought overpower worked
[2:42:40] <+ZoltanBMagnus> when enemy staggered, use abilities
[2:42:54] <%jiin6> Stagger then fill ATB
[2:42:54] <%doc_ock_rokc> When enemy staggered Triangle
[2:42:55] <residentfrank> Wait till the enemies are pressured > use a high stagger move > then use another ability
[2:42:58] <%galaxyswirl> 1
[2:42:59] <BinaryShuffle> UNIQUE abilities
[2:42:59] <Theonlypegsus> ????
[2:43:01] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> I cant help ya lol
[2:43:02] <+SLSheppard> Does unique abilities just mean character-specific abilities?
[2:43:05] <%king_wragles> BARRET YOU DUMB FUCK
[2:43:13] <Chaoko99> barett is a good dad
[2:43:14] <%nobodybutalex> When staggered use triangle to get ATB
[2:43:14] <%Owkono> its worded wierd
[2:43:17] <+TheHeroAppears> unique abilities are uh... unique abilities
[2:43:18] <%HotBloodedHero> Do you have to fill the gauge all the way each time?
[2:43:20] <+SundanceShot> barett good dad
[2:43:20] <%mield916> Use abilities on Staggered enemies
[2:43:21] <%bread_assassin> The Ability you use has to both Stagger the enemy AND fill up an ATB section.
[2:43:21] <%코코꾸라> Unique abilities are bravery and all those ones
[2:43:23] <Shishi1205> Gottem
[2:43:25] <%king_wragles> Barret is my favorite now
[2:43:25] <tolloponik> attack to charge the ATB gauge on a staggered enemy
[2:43:31] <%king_wragles> that dumb bastard
[2:43:34] <%joylent_blue> Barret does all the voices omg
[2:43:37] <%nobodybutalex> they don't have to stagger!
[2:43:37] <%코코꾸라> Absolutely not
[2:43:39] <%joylent_blue> what a good dad
[2:43:39] <%Yummy_Nukes> barret is a good ecoterrorist
[2:43:43] <%bread_assassin> The Triangle ability.
[2:43:44] <%VashyronM> @PatStaresAt Use your Triangle abilities to build ATB on Stagger. Basically, have Cloud go into Punisher and wail on a guy while they are stagger
[2:43:48] <rbakervv> tringle attacks charge abp
[2:43:53] <cosmicgoatee> LUL git gud on staggers
[2:43:54] <+SLSheppard> The early tutorials made it clear that using abilities on staggered enemies charged ATB faster.
[2:43:54] <Treuan> Name is guy. One guy.
[2:43:54] <BinaryShuffle> in other words use 10 abilities with DIFFERENT NAMES on a staggered enemy
[2:43:54] <Shishi1205> Triangle then
[2:43:58] <%galaxyswirl> triangle attack is an ability
[2:44:07] <heartlesshealer> Tifa too strong, use Cloud
[2:44:10] <%galaxyswirl> apparently
[2:44:17] <%VashyronM> @PatStaresAt That's how I got it complete. It's badly worded
[2:44:21] <Chaoko99> HSSSSSSSSSSS
[2:44:21] <residentfrank> triangle is a character specific unique ability
[2:44:21] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> then stp killing them fast
[2:44:26] <Zombrocom> Well, whatever you are doing is clearly not working
[2:44:29] <%nobodybutalex> You don't have to do unique ones you can just do punisher mode for all of them
[2:44:30] <Buttku> hey guys, is Pat liking the game or nah?
[2:44:35] <+TheHeroAppears> who is this cloud guy the chat keeps mentioning? you mean Clumbo?
[2:44:38] <%SoFarFetched> hes liking it
[2:44:40] <$Dakuu75> 10 with different names... oh so, using the same ability that's been counted won't work. you need 10 absolutly different named abilites
[2:45:00] <Shishi1205> are there 10 different ones?
[2:45:00] <Buttku> @sofarfetched excellent
[2:45:01] <hassanico2> Did everyone see that Article complaining that FF7 Easy Mode is too Easy? LUL
[2:45:01] <%Hellarussian> no tthe bubbles
[2:45:02] <%nobodybutalex> that's wrong you can jsut use one
[2:45:03] <Dr_Mooose> bubble attack!
[2:45:07] <heartlesshealer> Bubblebeam!
[2:45:09] <+TheHeroAppears> CAESAAAAAAAR
[2:45:10] <42nfl19> scan?
[2:45:12] <Treuan> Boom bubble!
[2:45:14] <%honeyman18> THE FLYING FISH ARE HERE
[2:45:17] <%PanicSwytch> POKEMONS
[2:45:18] <shiny_prinny> hell bubbles!
[2:45:21] <residentfrank> @hassanico2 kotaku?
[2:45:25] <%cervidaequus> These bug things are gross
[2:45:27] <+linSP> nice work cloud
[2:45:27] <WarchiefGoldva> JESUS
[2:45:31] <hassanico2> @residentfrank who else?
[2:45:31] <$Dakuu75> a flying puffer-fish... that's a nightmare
[2:45:32] <%bread_assassin> The unique abilties means ones that are character specific they don't need to be different from each other.
[2:45:35] <Shishi1205> Tiffa is too stronk
[2:45:37] <BinaryShuffle> BIG AND STRONG
[2:45:38] <heartlesshealer> Tifa TOO STRONG
[2:45:48] <%Hellarussian> number too big
[2:45:48] <+love_otter> Why is Access not the first thing you do in every fight?
[2:45:52] <residentfrank> @hassanico2 thats why i'm asking. Has to be them haha
[2:45:52] <+Neoripo> Powered down
[2:46:00] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Chat what the fuck
[2:46:05] <%Partialrecall2> no duh Tifa's streong look at her pecks fr fr
[2:46:08] <%Laecerelius> Access requires ATB to use
[2:46:10] <+DiabloDeAzul> You learn weapon abilities once you level up enough
[2:46:12] <TurtleButter> that, and not doing the thing.
[2:46:17] <Shishi1205> nice lap
[2:46:19] <%galaxyswirl> so whats the confusing part of this cause now im confused by pat being confused
[2:46:20] <Treuan> Alright, time to go out and find groceries. Pray for me chat
[2:46:20] <%king_wragles> @TurtlesAndTentacles what's up?
[2:46:20] <%BallerSwagBro9k> DIG UP STUPID
[2:46:26] <residentfrank> no you learn waeapon abilities by using said ability
[2:46:28] <%VashyronM> @PatStaresAt No. They just have to be Staggered and use your "Unique Character Abilities" to complete it. i.e Punisher mode, Overcharge, and Whirlwind Uppercut. Then, you build ATB from those and it ticks off the quest.
[2:46:31] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Just do the thing to make the number go up, simple
[2:46:36] <%nobodybutalex> basically just use Cloud's punisher combo on s taggered enemy to fill an ATB gauge
[2:46:41] <boomstickery> but but the materia
[2:46:47] <%cervidaequus> Hit enemy gain number
[2:46:48] <Chaoko99> barett hates climbing because he only has one hand
[2:46:51] <heartlesshealer> sleep enemies are the worst in an action game
[2:46:54] <Shishi1205> one fear

[2:49:05] <%professormorrigan> Woolie plays with a controller/mouse combo
[2:49:06] <Dr_Mooose> only if it is tiny
[2:49:08] <$Dakuu75> DUDE, look down and see how far up you are! imagine all the ppl that fell off and landed int he slums
[2:49:09] <%jiin6> Barret's the sex symbol
[2:49:10] <CookieCutter007> FeelsBadMan
[2:49:13] <%Hellarussian> make Cloud make a little fez
[2:49:22] <%XeroSigmaPrime> FF15 did that except it was poorly written dialogue, this game does it top tier

[2:49:31] <cosmicgoatee> Ask Gabe Nomurell
[2:49:33] <rsg220> If Tifa wears a hat but also plays the banjo, what will you do then?
[2:49:33] <%DonatelloJose> DonatelloJose subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months, currently on a 11 month streak! But when do we make Cloud pretty?
[2:49:33] <%cervidaequus> Make cloud wear noctis’ fishing hat and jacket
[2:49:34] <$lotharrio> What if it's just a piece of paper that she wears in her hair that is vaguely hat-shaped?
[2:49:35] <%Partialrecall2> elevator cinematic battle with waves of enemies?!
[2:49:43] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Tifa with a beret would be dope
[2:49:51] <Chaoko99> who cares, it's the middle of the night

[2:49:54] <%StaceMcGate> Backtrack time!

[2:53:40] <+CelioHogane> @KaiserMario no

[2:56:19] <Malisin_Murder> I've had Cream of Wheat but never cocowheat
[2:56:21] <+TheHeroAppears> pat grinded too much and now he can't grind

[2:56:41] <Melchior_the_Wise> It's an LED lamp
[2:56:42] <%TheMattman1313> Depends on how much cooling there is on the shell

[2:56:53] <%JumbleJams> psaWrong
[2:56:54] <RichochetForce> This is a videogame. Realism doesn't matter. But yes, these lamps would be red hot, melting or burning.
[2:56:54] <PirateMike_> Butter is delicious
[2:56:55] <%Typhaeon> Lard is even better
[2:56:59] <Ner234> Ban them
[2:56:59] <%SoFarFetched> Butter is great
[2:56:59] <@commanderclaw> Compound butter is divine

[2:57:16] <%SoFarFetched> Yeah lard is used quite a bit in mexican dishes.
[2:57:16] <%Hellarussian> butter is better than batter
[2:57:18] <+exiled_blood> Live in south. Butter and bacon fat is how I grew up.
[2:57:18] <Gregorhasjoined> You can spread butter on everything, especially yourself ;D
[2:57:20] <%zeif00> Ghee is great
[2:57:22] <%theotherkristian> Duck Fat > Lard
[2:57:23] <%cervidaequus> Ghee is best
[2:57:25] <+CelioHogane> Scan?
[2:57:27] <%j0ustar> Butter is the ONLY thing that makes my face explode with acne though so I can't touch it
[2:57:29] <+Neoripo> Olive Oil>---> Butter
[2:57:30] <transporterthesequel> No butter is NORMAL
[2:57:33] <asurite_warrior> used to get butter from this amish family and it was so much more rich and flavorful
[2:57:35] <MaritimeSpanker> Good onya, Paige! Butter makes it taste better! Ever tried to put a small bit of butter in hot, mashed-together potatoes?
[2:57:38] <%BallerSwagBro9k> BUTTER IS GOD

[2:57:50] <%Partialrecall2> tifa butter
[2:57:51] <SomersaultJustice> butter is ok
[2:57:51] <Shishi1205> To cook oil is way better
[2:57:52] <+FluxUmia> Paige is on point with the butter. So butter and mustard now?
[2:57:53] <Chaoko99> It shoudl be
[2:57:55] <hassanico2> People who need butter on everything deserve the shape they're in
[2:58:00] <%AllenDeadman> can you get the materia behind the fan now?
[2:58:02] <+CelioHogane> MATERIA TIME
[2:58:05] <boomstickery> vidya gaymes
[2:58:08] <%j0ustar> @Birdigalore if only were it so easy
[2:58:09] <$lotharrio> Here's a tip, cook bread until it's brown and a little crispy, then put a slab of butter on one side.
[2:58:11] <%Partialrecall2> ingest
[2:58:11] <+BubbaRands> I HEARD THAT
[2:58:13] <%BeatBo_2> ASMR
[2:58:13] <Ner234> CRUNCH
[2:58:17] <asurite_warrior> Butter alone isnt bad for you. Just say away from sugar
[2:58:19] <Gregorhasjoined> AH MY EARS
[2:58:20] <%Mantisman01> Butter ruins all that it touches! nothing worse in a ham & mustard sandwich than that curdled milk shite!!!
[2:58:20] <dan_g_v> omg guys
[2:58:22] <TimetodiveLTX> the system is not perfect
[2:58:23] <%CursedNobleman> @lotharrio no... impossible.
[2:58:24] <Sokumotanaka> The vagina is talking
[2:58:31] <%nofestu2> fats are good for you
[2:58:32] <%Tearonex> item missed
[2:58:33] <+DiabloDeAzul> muh keto
[2:58:36] <Theonlypegsus> WOW
[2:58:37] <%doc_ock_rokc> Nope Butter fat is good
[2:58:38] <%cervidaequus> Margarine is chemical
[2:58:38] <+CelioHogane> This music sounds kinda like Gurren Lagann, a little.
[2:58:41] <icecreamwave> Kreygasm I keep losing while playing this game chat.
[2:58:42] <%Partialrecall2> animal fat is monounsatured and quite the best for you as opposed to other fats
[2:58:44] <%Jekado> margarine is actually unhealthier
[2:58:46] <draugrix> using butter is FAR BETTER than cooking with oil
[2:58:46] <jobbedbone> butter isn't even that bad....
[2:58:49] <%SoFarFetched> That's someone who doesn't know ANYTHING about butter.
[2:58:53] <heartlesshealer> people don't know shit about butter
[2:58:54] <Angry_Ev1L> people has no idea about anything really LUL
[2:58:54] <%retrohazard> butter is a fuck ton healthier than eating margarine
[2:58:56] <%doc_ock_rokc> @margarine can be unhealthy
[2:58:56] <%Shady_Squid> I fry tons of stuff in unsalted butter. It's great.
[2:58:57] <Sokumotanaka> Who said that? Blow them up that really fucking rude
[2:58:58] <bestwaifuritsu> theres a difference between the people that cook with butter and the people who straight up eat sticks of it for snacks
[2:58:59] <LVDoomien> what's a nutrition anyway
[2:58:59] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Fuck whoever said that
[2:59:01] <%Laecerelius> Sugar fucks you up way more than butter
[2:59:01] <%PanicSwytch> psa1guy
[2:59:01] <abakkus> people who make comments like that usually dont know how weight/bodies work lmao
[2:59:03] <Shishi1205> salted butter od
[2:59:04] <asurite_warrior> Dont do bread. Dont do sugar. Do butter
[2:59:05] <dan_g_v> whoopsid
[2:59:06] <%Mantisman01> Magerine is also bad!
[2:59:07] <+carzeri> you cant really cook with margarine
[2:59:07] <%JumbleJams> butter is good, you just don't eat a whole tub of it LUL
[2:59:07] <YakumoYomi> Margarine is for COWARDS
[2:59:08] <boomstickery> sugar is worse for oyu than fat, its mostly calories in calories out but insulin matters to health
[2:59:08] <dmian07> You just need to not go overbiard with you caolorie intake and you'll be fine
[2:59:09] <%jiin6> Right fats for pat and paige
[2:59:10] <Theonlypegsus> Whats that?
[2:59:10] <thelonechris> I can't believe its not butter
[2:59:11] <%THATGUY_789> I trust cows over scientists
[2:59:12] <$Dakuu75> MARGARINE IS NOT FOOD!!!! It's literally a bunch of random-ass chemical!
[2:59:14] <+FluxUmia> Sugar is the only real bad thing in Paige's chocolate nutriant paste
[2:59:14] <FrankysDream> saturated fat is the healthier one
[2:59:14] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Everything is fine in moderation with exercise.
[2:59:15] <%DonatelloJose> Nutrition is a bizarre science that i cannot understand.
[2:59:15] <TimetodiveLTX> don't do weed
[2:59:18] <%honeyman18> Gotta be Sweet Cream Butter, or Irish Butter
[2:59:19] <LeaIsChill> Frankly, I can't believe it's not butter!
[2:59:21] <%Daniel_Is_I> Turns out you can eat pretty much anything you want if you maintain a calorie deficit.
[2:59:21] <%Mantisman01> why can people just enjoy bread?!?
[2:59:23] <+Superbro64> do people think that people that use butter eat it straight from the entire stick or some shit??
[2:59:24] <Melchior_the_Wise> Carbs are not good if you don't use it for it's intended purpose
[2:59:26] <+CelioHogane> I like Margerine a lot, Butter is too oily.
[2:59:27] <+Sulfur_Boride> When I was cooking toast in a pan with butter, and my mom suggested I use cooking spray oil instead, for whatever goddamn reason, I almost wanted to stab her with a butterknife
[2:59:27] <%Hellarussian> your goblins made you too strong
[2:59:28] <Nupinoop296> bread good
[2:59:29] <brambobelurkin> Most people think fat=bad
[2:59:29] <%Mantisman01> can't*
[2:59:29] <%BallerSwagBro9k> I cook with butter all my life and im fine
[2:59:29] <$lotharrio> Milk is bad for you! Or good! Some kinds of milk! I guess?!
[2:59:31] <%Partialrecall2> animals wont eat margarine and thats about the only evidence i need to not eat it
[2:59:37] <asurite_warrior> NO FRIED BUTTER DIET
[2:59:38] <qo_op> it's a holdover from wartime substitution when butter was rationed
[2:59:41] <%KaiserMario> Nobody knows how nutrition works... I eat buckets of ice-cream and care little for diet and weight less than 60 Kg, and I'm 30
[2:59:41] <Shishi1205> it can kill you that's the deal
[2:59:44] <%AllenDeadman> waaaait
[2:59:44] <%the38bandit> Butter is fine
[2:59:47] <%AllenDeadman> the fan materia
[2:59:47] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt Well paige its not great for you but if you consume a lot of it your body feeds on it instead of sugar
[2:59:47] <boomstickery> cholesterol is essential for making hormaones
[2:59:50] <%Typhaeon> Bacon and eggs were Satan, then they didn't affect cholesterol at all, then ????
[2:59:50] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> I mostly use olive oil when I cook
[2:59:54] <TimetodiveLTX> fats are calorie dense but that's not the whole story
[2:59:56] <SchroedingersFerret> That's not true
[2:59:58] <Angry_Ev1L> cholesterol transfers fat through your body or something
[3:00:01] <Daskolin> Butter is OK. Because of natural FAT. People who complain about butter eat SOY that stay in your body for longer. Also animals eat margarin
[3:00:01] <%cervidaequus> Elmo love milk chocolate tho
[3:00:01] <$Dakuu75> Always use Butter instead of Margarine. Margarine is a fucking frankenstien, not-food, garbage!
[3:00:02] <MSN04_Sazabi> Neither should people
[3:00:03] <RichochetForce> @DonatelloJose Too many variables. Age, sex, weight, ethnic background, general diet, metabolism, exercise. It complicates the FUCK out of things.
[3:00:04] <%rumtumtugnutz> my cat LOVES margarine
[3:00:08] <%realm_forge> Good olive oil is king
[3:00:08] <%king_wragles> Little known fact, nutritionists never actually said fat was bad. Sugar companies pushed REALLY hard to get anything other than sugar blamed for the problems sugar cause (massive weight gain, tooth decay, etc)
[3:00:08] <+DiabloDeAzul> More like "we can't treat humans like lab rats, so getting a control group is extremely hard and we can't tape their habits"
[3:00:09] <%EuropanLamprey> Probably a smell too subtle for humans to notice
[3:00:10] <%zeif00> good cholesterol good, bad cholesterol bad
[3:00:12] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt ITS MAKO COLORED
[3:00:12] <$lotharrio> Animals also avoid spicy food, since hot spice is basically a kind of poison.
[3:00:13] <%THATGUY_789> but nothing
[3:00:13] <straidulf> Isn't margarine vegetable oil? Smells too much like vegetables
[3:00:13] <%dukenux> i heard that you shouldnt use extra vergin for cooking
[3:00:14] <Shishi1205> anotha lamp
[3:00:14] <FrankysDream> margarine is literally poison
[3:00:15] <%SoFarFetched> My cat likes cheese and I feed them a little bit.
[3:00:21] <+BubbaRands> ALL FOOD IS BAD FOR YOU JUST LIVE OFF AN IV TUBE
[3:00:21] <SomersaultJustice> you only powered it enough to tell you there isn't enough power
[3:00:21] <LeaIsChill> Cats like their own balls
[3:00:25] <Melchior_the_Wise> Pat can't believe it's not Butter
[3:00:26] <StencilOST> what
[3:00:26] <+CelioHogane> BUT ANTI-FREEZE IS DELICIOUS
[3:00:27] <MaritimeSpanker> Elmo also likes eating bits of himself, so
[3:00:27] <%THATGUY_789> and chocolate
[3:00:27] <Theonlypegsus> Butter is kinda bad for me since I have Hight Blood pressure I think. But then again I don't eat a lot of buttery things too often.
[3:00:28] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Fuck too late
[3:00:30] <YakumoYomi> Speaking of butter: what's Fabio up to these days?
[3:00:33] <%bread_assassin> Cats also like CHOCOLATE
[3:00:33] <hassanico2> Who eats antifreeze?
[3:00:33] <dan_g_v> green? sounds like disease
[3:00:33] <+TrickyTrouT> wait what
[3:00:34] <Dr_Mooose> mood
[3:00:35] <MSN04_Sazabi> Margarine is unironically more unhealthy than butter
[3:00:39] <%Emperor_Machinus> only for humans
[3:00:39] <%honeyman18> They had to make it less sweet
[3:00:39] <%bread_assassin> That kills them.
[3:00:41] <%professormorrigan> mmmmmh anti-freeze
[3:00:42] <%SoFarFetched> Just don't put antifreeze in the wine
[3:00:43] <+Sulfur_Boride> ???
[3:00:44] <%ergulor> Yeah is sweet
[3:00:44] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Is it actually?
[3:00:45] <straidulf> Im gonna have to taste anti-freeze now
[3:00:45] <%Partialrecall2> they put glycol in booze
[3:00:45] <%rumtumtugnutz> margarine is oil and stabilizers, it's not poison.
[3:00:45] <SchroedingersFerret> The cat may have a little margarine, as a snack
[3:00:45] <Sagata_> Has a sweet taste
[3:00:48] <%Djinnazz> no it's not?
[3:00:49] <VeryTricky> is Paige still viciously cooking cuz of quarantine
[3:00:49] <LVDoomien> anti-freeze use to have a sweet taste apparently and some lady got tricked into drinking it b/c it was in her yellow gatorade
[3:00:50] <%j0ustar> what?
[3:00:51] <%walternatorz> paige didn't specify if humans shouldn't drink antifreeze
[3:00:55] <%DonatelloJose> @RichochetForce I just don't eat fast food anymore and roll the dice on everything else.
[3:00:56] <+TheHeroAppears> we are all nutritionists
[3:00:57] <Malisin_Murder> Looks like juice though
[3:00:57] <+FluxUmia> Need a diet antifreeze.
[3:00:58] <+DiabloDeAzul> MonkaX
[3:00:58] <%goldenchaos96> 'yes the cats'
[3:01:00] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Wait does Anti-freeze actually taste good?...
[3:01:01] <Shishi1205> Not so fun fact paracetamol can kill a cat @PatStaresAt
[3:01:02] <Chaoko99> INGEST
[3:01:03] <ashuckel> margarine is unhealthy as fuck
[3:01:05] <dmian07> Pat you are gonna miss all the materia if you dont use the elevators for more than advancing the story
[3:01:08] <cosmicgoatee> NotLikeThis buncha antifreeze advocates
[3:01:10] <boomstickery> i thoguht she was going to say "my dad would start drinking anti freeze" like jessu whata childhood
[3:01:10] <+CelioHogane> FORBIDDEN SNACK
[3:01:11] <Theonlypegsus> OH NO
[3:01:11] <%Djinnazz> I refuse to believe that.
[3:01:12] <$Dakuu75> anti-freeze is very well known for being sweet
[3:01:13] <Angry_Ev1L> you can taste it A LITTLE
[3:01:14] <dan_g_v> yeah, that sounds like a Saliva family fear
[3:01:15] <%Typhaeon> No, you cannot have even a little antifreeze, even as a treat
[3:01:16] <asurite_warrior> so can I wash my mouth with anti freeze
[3:01:17] <Kondibon> It's also super alcohol.
[3:01:18] <%CursedNobleman> antifreeze is chemically similar to alcohol, but its poisonous
[3:01:18] <+BubbaRands> ONLY ONE WAY TO FIND OUT
[3:01:21] <%cervidaequus> Brightly coloured and sweet, like soda!
[3:01:22] <%SoFarFetched> Then look it up if you're so unsure @Djinnazz
[3:01:22] <%LosersOnlyTaunt> Coolant tastes bad, it has a sweet sent that animals like
[3:01:23] <Melchior_the_Wise> Margarine way healthier than Anti-Freeze
[3:01:23] <@commanderclaw> Isn't there a really sweet poison or something? Like hemlock?
[3:01:24] <FlamingoJazz> Can't wait for Anti-Freeze Jelly beans. :)
[3:01:24] <%Owkono> ethylene glycol
[3:01:24] <draugrix> the forbidden kool aide
[3:01:25] <LeaIsChill> It's delicious :)
[3:01:25] <Gregorhasjoined> Hm...brb going to the garage for unrelated reasons
[3:01:26] <%DonatelloJose> BRB going to the garage to do big science. I'll let you know chat
[3:01:27] <RichochetForce> @DonatelloJose Yeah, avoiding fast food and junk food is pretty clearly bad for you.
[3:01:27] <Katorskay> They made it not sweet anymore years ago
[3:01:29] <%KasiCrafter> Oh, so Gatorade IS anti-freeze!
[3:01:31] <%dukenux> Antifreeze shots challenge
[3:01:32] <%Kenori> now I kind wanna taste it
[3:01:32] <heartlesshealer> It's the only reason animals love it so much
[3:01:35] <hat_under_bread> Antifreeze even smells sweet. It's pretty obvious if you've ever been around it.
[3:01:36] <Sagata_> Worked in a shop. Can confirm does have a sweetness to it.
[3:01:36] <thelonechris> I'm drinking an antifreeze latte right now
[3:01:37] <%doc_ock_rokc> Anti freeze was put in various fake liqures during Prohibition
[3:01:39] <+Neoripo> Tastes like death
[3:01:41] <%j0ustar> WE HAVE FOUND THE FORBIDDEN DRINK!
[3:01:41] <cureneckbeard> so it's delicious AND you won't freeze
[3:01:42] <Sokumotanaka> WAIT REALLY?
[3:01:43] <$BoSteed> Ingredients from anti-freeze is also used in certain mouthwash.
[3:01:43] <YakumoYomi> Drink the antifreeze. Got it.
[3:01:45] <%SoFarFetched> Its what's usually used to murder people with LUL
[3:01:46] <%professormorrigan> im gonna try it now, pat thanks
[3:01:47] <%ergulor> Is the Ethylene glycol
[3:01:47] <LVDoomien> basically pour sugar all over a frozen surface and it'll melt instantly. That's how antifreeze works sabrejHashiLOL sabrejHashiLOL
[3:01:47] <hassanico2> Are these flying seahorses?!
[3:01:48] <$lotharrio> What did you never see that episode of the Simpsons? The criminal French wine makers put anti-freeze in their wine to make it taste good. But they get arrested for it.
[3:01:48] <Shishi1205> yes
[3:01:48] <pineapple_pizza0> It does not taste sweet trust me
[3:01:49] <%Partialrecall2> propolene glycol, an antifreeze is basically tasteless and does come in food grade and they add it to vape juice popcorn butter and hard liquor
[3:01:50] <straidulf> forbidden thirst quencher
[3:01:51] <Theonlypegsus> Anti-freeze in my tea, Anti-freeze in my balls
[3:01:52] <%Yummy_Nukes> one if my neighbors killed my dog with antifreeze
[3:01:53] <FrankysDream> margarine has a lot of trans-fat which all doctors will tell you is basically poison
[3:01:56] <Malisin_Murder> monkaS
[3:01:56] <%nofestu2> yup
[3:01:56] <+CelioHogane> PAT, level two scans everybody
[3:01:57] <%coreyyotto> Animals crave the sweet release of death
[3:01:57] <dan_g_v> tastes like death? Ah, like the sweet release of death! Sugary!
[3:01:57] <+Superbro64> What does gasoline taste like tho?
[3:01:58] <$Dakuu75> WOW REALLY?! lol
[3:02:00] <+FluxUmia> and it killed a BUNCH of people
[3:02:00] <%StaceMcGate> @PatStaresAt analyze lvl 2 scans all enmies
[3:02:01] <SchroedingersFerret> I heard that Margarine is only one molecule away from antifreeze
[3:02:02] <Melchior_the_Wise> BY THE GOVERNMENT

[3:02:03] <TheHotStuven> SUPER ASSESS
[3:02:04] <%SoFarFetched> IT WAS IN A SIMPSONS EPISODE WHERE THE FRENCH PEOPLE PUT ANTI FREEZE IN THE WINE
[3:02:04] <%bevyrage> yeah it was real
[3:02:04] <corpsegoo> when your assess levels up it assesses everything
[3:02:04] <%rumtumtugnutz> ethylene glycol isn't poisonous. propalene glycol is the poisonous one.
[3:02:05] <%Kenori> forbidden yum
[3:02:05] <heartlesshealer> Captain Planet even warns you about anti-freeze at the end of one episode, IIRC
[3:02:06] <%realm_forge> It’s sweet but toxic like an ex
[3:02:06] <%nofestu2> it ages wine
[3:02:06] <asurite_warrior> Yeah to kill peopel
[3:02:08] <%trustycoyote> It's real, Paige.

[3:02:14] <%SoFarFetched> Well two french people LUL
[3:02:16] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Would it be painless?
[3:02:17] <dmian07> The gov were trying to kill people
[3:02:17] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt Yeah. That and other chemstry to make one liter into two
[3:02:17] <CoconutGun69> oh yeah antifreeze tastes kinda like a weird maple syrup.
[3:02:18] <%Neryl_> @PatStaresAt I've also heard this. Had a scumbag neighbor that used to poison a ton of coyotes with it.
[3:02:19] <Kondibon> It basically gets you drunk to death.
[3:02:20] <%coreyyotto> That was the idea. To prove that alcohol was dangerous
[3:02:20] <@commanderclaw> Well get ready for another one
[3:02:21] <gekizenbu> oh people had zero standards in the prohibition era for alchohol
[3:02:21] <+BubbaRands> THEY DRANK ANYTHING
[3:02:21] <straidulf> Shitty moonshiners would make people blind
[3:02:21] <Arth__> my Balls? i'm looking for that. Read spraying Axe on your balls will make you go sterile

[3:02:27] <%king_wragles> @PatStaresAt Ya, bath tub gin killed a good couple hundred people every year of the prohibition
[3:02:27] <dan_g_v> You'd end up blind with a tiny bit of antifreeze

[3:04:13] <%VashyronM> @PatStaresAt It has to be able to fill up

[3:04:15] <broostmonkey> CHARGE THE ATB WITH TRIANGLE
[3:04:16] <%cervidaequus> Empty then fill it up

[3:05:02] <myriad_truth> I need to buy this game just to try this goofy mechanic.
[3:05:07] <$Dakuu75> kirby... just... *deep sigh*
[3:05:14] <+CelioHogane> @Kirby_Sauce Saying YIIK is a good game will curse your balls.
[3:05:15] <Chaoko99> Kirby sauce with that fucking take. can't wait for pat to read that
[3:05:22] <%JumbleJams> kirby spending 5 bucks to be blasted on stream
[3:05:24] <%SomeSageAdvice> doesnt have to be full, has to be full, has to make it full on that attack, needs to be empty, this chat is confusing psaWhat
[3:05:25] <jobbedbone> @Kirby_Sauce not even bait at this point
[3:05:29] <%Fenrirlives> kirbysauce continues to be a living warcrime
[3:05:30] <%cervidaequus> Kirby has been rendered fully blind by his light mode
[3:05:32] <%j0ustar> Kirby why
[3:05:32] <%weissguard> @Kirby_Sauce Nice B8 M8, I R8T 8/8
[3:05:43] <%Typhaeon> Kirby is big baitin'

[3:05:57] <hassanico2> It's just bait you jackasses
[3:05:58] <LeaIsChill> Kirby bathes in acid and enjoys the taste
[3:06:00] <+Tyonidus> Alright who's jumping Kirby with me on the way to his car or whatever
[3:06:01] <heartlesshealer> Kirby shitposting with Bits

[3:06:04] <%Typhaeon> Also eating eggs he described as "technicolor" which I assume is code for "full of DMT"
[3:06:05] <%honeyman18> I tried playing YIIK and I literally gave up like 1/3rd of the way in
[3:06:07] <%Partialrecall2> coco weed > rainbow eggs

[3:06:12] <MSN04_Sazabi> I'd believe it if not for the YIIK mention
[3:06:14] <%JumbleJams> kirby drinks anti-freeze pass it on
[3:06:15] <%코코꾸라> Pat, do not eat my family
[3:06:15] <%Kirby_Sauce> not bait. i genuinely loath it
[3:06:16] <%PhantomMiG> @patstaresat Antifreeze has a carbon group that is similar to sugar but recently companies have added a bitter agent to stop accidental ingestion

[3:06:58] <%Shady_Squid> All this talk about Anti-Freeze is making me want to drink it.

[3:07:22] <+DiabloDeAzul> @ledgefiendd Y2K (YIIK) is a parody rpg that tries way too hard to make fun of persona, could have been good but got full of itself
[3:07:23] <cosmicgoatee> They have people who have made drinkable cocktails that have the sweet factor of antifreeze but wont kill you

[3:14:58] <Chaoko99> @FluxUmia Slurry is way worse. You could put paste on toast or some shit
[3:15:01] <YakumoYomi> "Slurry" sounds nefarious
[3:15:01] <%BoomerUnchained> This section really drags on
[3:15:21] <+CelioHogane> @BoomerUnchained definetly, specially because it's not very interesting looking.
[3:15:22] <%EuropanLamprey> Slurry still sounds like food, Paste is worse
[3:15:24] <+Havictos> @boomerunchained ok boomer
[3:15:29] <Ipsenscastle> slurry sounds offalicious
[3:15:29] <%Jp3g95> It only drags if you are looking for the materia
[3:15:30] <%JumbleJams> @FluxUmia paste, slurry reminds me of slushies, which are good
[3:15:30] <+Odysseusftw> if theyre making every girl really horny im kinda worried what Aerith is going tho be like
[3:15:31] <TurtleButter> @FluxUmia Nutrient Slushy

[3:20:46] <hassanico2> Ah I see, it's an imbue to attacks/defense of whatever elemental materia is linked to it?
[3:20:46] <RichochetForce> @hassanico2 On weapons, gave them elemental attack. On armor, elemental defense. At max I think you wound up absorbing the element to heal.

[3:26:02] <Melchior_the_Wise> SO HARD
[3:26:03] <$lotharrio> I hope there's weird dicks all over the place, and that they reuse footage from the live action Jungle Book remake!
[3:26:03] <%Yummy_Nukes> DISNEY PLS
[3:26:04] <killrbumpkin> disney loves furrys tbf
[3:26:05] <%BallerSwagBro9k> PLZ SA SIKE
[3:26:05] <KaliasTV> Welcome to the Furture
[3:26:06] <cosmicgoatee> Its not even like zootopia
[3:26:07] <+Remery_> The Furry Era
[3:26:07] <%CappuccinoGuil> OKAY, BUT WHAT IF THEY ARE ALL FURSUITS, THO???
[3:26:09] <YakumoYomi> I'm not surprised...but I am terrified.
[3:26:09] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> I remember. It was better.
[3:26:09] <%THATGUY_789> keep them in
[3:26:10] <%narusao> remember 2d animated movies?
[3:26:10] <%superstarsage> BECAUSE MONEY
[3:26:10] <%indig0bird> Wait, no one watched Cats lol
[3:26:11] <%Dragovus> DOWN WITH DISNEY!
[3:26:11] <Ipsenscastle> Robin Hood was the best Disney film by far
[3:26:12] <MSN04_Sazabi> Earth is getting cancelled early
[3:26:12] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Blame Beastatrs
[3:26:12] <JaceDarkstar> paige stoooop pls I'm dying
[3:26:14] <Tha_Mik> It better be like the Cats movie
[3:26:14] <$Dakuu75> disney is on a downward tail-spin with their fucking remakes
[3:26:14] <+Buzzkill983> Why are we still here? Just to suffer?
[3:26:16] <%doc_ock_rokc> @TomFrank Everyone should be getting theirs within the week
[3:26:16] <+FluxUmia> Modern furry wave
[3:26:16] <@commanderclaw> Cause China
[3:26:17] <Strider222> remember when disney made something different than remakes
[3:26:17] <%deserter_hedwyn> Pat what's your opinion on Jesse and her insatiable Cloud thirst?
[3:26:19] <myriad_truth> I just watched Beastars so I can't say nothing
[3:26:19] <Theonlypegsus> I do. Its so bad.
[3:26:20] <%Jekado> put me in the disney vault instead
[3:26:20] <%MonsterEnvy> OK just checked they remaking it as a CGI movie
[3:26:21] <+b9k9com> Robin hood was a fun animated film
[3:26:21] <%UvBenServed> Unless they're straight up wearing mascot costumes, not interested
[3:26:24] <%MonsterEnvy> not a live action one
[3:26:24] <%arcielardor> IT'S MEDEVAL CATS!!!
[3:26:24] <%CappuccinoGuil> FURSUIT REMAKE OR RIOT
[3:26:25] <%indig0bird> I'm ok with a 3D remake of the movie
[3:26:26] <transporterthesequel> High def furries
[3:26:26] <%EuropanLamprey> They need to make the movies "Mature" for adults
[3:26:26] <%Metballs> tbf, Maid Marian tho...
[3:26:27] <heartlesshealer> Because they now realize that artificial scarcity doesn't work in a world with THE INTERNET
[3:26:29] <gekizenbu> vault's haunted
[3:26:31] <%doc_ock_rokc> @TomFrank You got it early
[3:26:32] <+SaltyGhostRock> Put the buttholes in the theatrical release Disney SwiftRage
[3:26:32] <%dukenux> what is Disney remaking now?
[3:26:32] <Gregorhasjoined> artificial scarcity doesn't sound as markettable as THE DISNEY VAULT
[3:26:35] <%Buzzard42> @Strider222 yeah Frozen 2 was a few months ago
[3:26:35] <Ner234> Why does Paige croak sometimes???
[3:26:38] <framewindowcleaner> Imagine still caring about Disney in 2020 LUL
[3:26:39] <%MonsterEnvy> It's a CGI remake not a live action one
[3:26:40] <lessthanhuman_tv> Times are about to get a lot harder when Maid Marian is on screen
[3:26:41] <%collind99> The only live action type movies that have been good are Cinderella and The Jungle Book @patstaresat @peachsaliva
[3:26:42] <%narusao> robin hood... except they're all cats! and it's a musical!
[3:26:42] <bestwaifuritsu> PAIGE NO, the Disney Vault was a lie to get people to spend money on vhs tapes by creating a fake demand to buy or lose out.
[3:26:43] <%THATGUY_789> Fox and the Hound would work much better
[3:26:45] <%Yummy_Nukes> CAN'T WE JUST STOP DOING CGI LIVE ACTION DISNEY MOVIES ALREADY
[3:26:48] <cosmicgoatee> It's not cgi like zootopia why bother
[3:26:48] <Explodincatz> yup
[3:26:51] <%BoomerUnchained> I wish they'd put everything they made the last few years and put in a vault and seal it forever
[3:26:52] <%j0ustar> Do me a well-made live action Treasure Planet and then you'll have my attention
[3:26:58] <%PhysicsLB> limiting materia slots is artificial scarcity
[3:27:04] <YakumoYomi> How else could Disney control the secondhand market for their movies?
[3:27:08] <Macfine> I wish they would stop calling them "live action" when its all just CGI
[3:27:10] <%weissguard> I find it funny that Frozen 2 didn't seem to have anywhere near as hard a push as Frozen 1.
[3:27:10] <%dukenux> Is Disney's vault where they keep Walt's head?
[3:27:12] <TioXyco> in midigard was always scarce
[3:27:13] <%MonsterEnvy> Make another 2d movie I say Disney
[3:27:16] <%iosephe> At least Song of the South is in there
[3:27:22] <%iosephe> Never to return
[3:27:23] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt Did you know that leaked doccuments from disney shows they are gonna do Vaults on Disney Plus
[3:27:23] <$Dakuu75> better than planned obsolescence
[3:27:25] <bestwaifuritsu> disney vault got absolutely fucked by things moving to digital and dvd
[3:27:26] <Gregorhasjoined> Dammit Shinra! THE PLANET IS DYIN
[3:27:31] <%UvBenServed> Don't you guys have healing magic?
[3:27:33] <indig0bird> I hate their "realistic" CGI movies. I feel they get dated the second they come out and limit the expresiveness of the charcters
[3:27:34] <lessthanhuman_tv> Is it bad that I'm pumped about new Maid Marian
[3:27:34] <+CelioHogane> THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE, WEDGE IS TOO BIG AND CLOUD IS A TWINK
[3:27:34] <+Odysseusftw> yeah along with mickey mouse nudes
[3:27:37] <%JumbleJams> @j0ustar dude, imagine it having the same budget as the pirates movies oh man
[3:27:38] <+lethallylactic> DansGame
[3:27:39] <+Buzzkill983> Those are big shoes for Cloud to fit
[3:27:39] <saiyan24675> @iosephe we don’t talk about that
[3:27:40] <%cvp5127> release song of the south cowards
[3:27:41] <Dr_Mooose> eww

[3:27:52] <%j0ustar> @JumbleJams that would be the BEST
[3:27:55] <heartlesshealer> They're already vaulting the TV-Only movies they got from purchasing FOX!!!
[3:27:55] <%EuropanLamprey> Disney is just screaming "PIRATE US!"
[3:27:56] <$lotharrio> I mean, you basically didn't ever have enough slots for Materia until you went into the Shinra Tower, right?
[3:27:57] <Gregorhasjoined> "Are the jews gone yet? ...put me back in."

[3:28:57] <CuttleCrow> its a good show
[3:28:57] <myriad_truth> Why? Don't you wanna join the great AVALANCHE??
[3:28:57] <%collind99> @patstaresat @peachsaliva the only good Disney live action remakes so far have been Cinderella and Jungle Book. It’s a super hit or miss record so far
[3:28:57] <+demon_shadowplays> sucks
[3:28:57] <Gregorhasjoined> Art is trash, can't if i tried
[3:28:58] <%MonsterEnvy> One Piece is a good manga not great anime
[3:29:00] <Darren716> Are ya'll dumb or something?
[3:29:01] <%dukenux> more lije One Piss
[3:29:01] <Khorneflakes_> cohhStare

[3:29:03] <Sol_Install> I miss the joke what?
[3:29:03] <%Metballs> Is this about cocaine?
[3:29:04] <lessthanhuman_tv> One piece doesn't have Maid Marian, and has no waifus so it sucks :)
[3:29:05] <Malisin_Murder> D:
[3:29:05] <%TheMattman1313> Does this mean Luffy is now a Disney Princess?
[3:29:05] <%MonsterEnvy> It's too slow
[3:29:06] <TimetodiveLTX> it is a good show and if you don't agree you're on the left side of the meme. you know the one
[3:29:06] <JoveGar> oh its because hes made of rubber
[3:29:06] <%Shady_Squid> I've actually been reading the manga in quarantine. It's pretty good.
[3:29:07] <+Odysseusftw> fuck this game is going to be sooooo long
[3:29:07] <Strider222> I prefer two pieces
[3:29:08] <%mighty_max_t> BECAUSE PIRATES
[3:29:09] <+D00msDayDan> he's saying PIRACY
[3:29:09] <%Buzzard42> one piece isn't very good
[3:29:09] <suitangi021> PIRATES
[3:29:10] <shutupyouprick> guys get it PIRATES jesus christ
[3:29:12] <dan_g_v> Imagine if they had to look for more than just one! Ha!
[3:29:13] <%trustycoyote> One Piece of what? You never finished your thought
[3:29:13] <sendart> yo ho
[3:29:13] <$lotharrio> Pat is your nose itchy?
[3:29:16] <%Yummy_Nukes> more like a bajillion pieces
[3:29:16] <%dukenux> ITS A PIRACY JOKE GUYS
[3:29:16] <%THATGUY_789> over the head and far away
[3:29:16] <+Parlux> gotta go yohooo uh oh
[3:29:17] <KaliasTV> This Piracy sponsored by Square Enix
[3:29:17] <%cvp5127> you wouldnt pirate a car?
[3:29:18] <%king_wragles> Pat, why are you talking about an anime based on PIRATES, doing PIRATE stuff?
[3:29:18] <+TrickyTrouT> pat are you doing cocaine again
[3:29:19] <%Dementedpenguin> Shut up, I want to talk about One Piece
[3:29:21] <%PhysicsLB> CMON CLOD
[3:29:22] <cosmicgoatee> Just READ IT
[3:29:22] <TioXyco> clog?
[3:29:23] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt Should the Onepeice be a swimsuit or all the gold melted into itself and thus can't be moved
[3:29:24] <+CelioHogane> DO IT, CLAUDE
[3:29:25] <%Dementedpenguin> Kappa
[3:29:29] <bestwaifuritsu> COOL RANCH
[3:29:32] <%PanicSwytch> But One Piece has tig ol bitties
[3:29:35] <ghostspartan80> nice joke C K
[3:29:41] <+Neoripo> One Piece is good but mindboggingly long
[3:29:43] <Strider222> yes
[3:29:44] <thetruthofyourbeing> so i understand this games pretty long?
[3:29:44] <%Djinnazz> you didn't get the blue one?
[3:29:45] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> LUL LUL LUL
[3:29:45] <%PettyFunk> Any anime that's not budgeted specifically on a season-to-season basis tends to be pretty awful (With some exceptions, like FMA:B)
[3:29:47] <Gregorhasjoined> I don't even associate One Piece with ANYTHING pirate related anymore. Is one-piece even about pirates still?
[3:29:55] <+tigerfang86> it super is
[3:29:57] <YakumoYomi> For better or worse, Oda has a vision for One Piece that he won't compromise on. Unfortunately, that vision includes tons of manga panels wasted on reaction shots from every bystander watching the current big battle
[3:30:00] <%hntronium> @Djinnazz He got it
[3:30:00] <+CelioHogane> @Gregorhasjoined oh it totally is
[3:30:05] <%Djinnazz> oh
[3:30:05] <dan_g_v> hit the lever, Kronk!
[3:30:07] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Barrett doesn't stop.
[3:30:09] <$lotharrio> I mean... in a sense.
[3:30:10] <+AnthraxJohnson> I swear if I see another Troll ad i’m gonna blow my brains out
[3:30:14] <%Buzzard42> Tifa's never been in one
[3:30:22] <%PanicSwytch> Is One Piece 80% completed?
[3:30:23] <%weissguard> One Piece should just be Gol D. Roger's corpse. Just to mess with people.
[3:30:24] <%NovaKnightmare> Barret is great
[3:30:29] <%collind99> @engwithan_elder_god can we talk about stuff that’s been in trailers
[3:30:29] <%MonsterEnvy> Barret is like a full on preacher
[3:30:30] <vivaldiva> mako, oh it sings to me
[3:30:31] <+CelioHogane> @PanicSwytch HAHAHAHAHA no.
[3:30:33] <myriad_truth> AVALANCHE IS GREAT
[3:30:33] <%doc_ock_rokc> @YakumoYomi One piece is the only manga not to lose that "New manga" feel
[3:30:36] <cosmicgoatee> @Gregorhasjoined its about a group of friends on a world journey where we learn everything the govt and corruption do is messed up and freedom is what we want to achieve
[3:30:36] <+Odysseusftw> when did he have it
[3:30:37] <%TheMattman1313> I think you mean "lost"
[3:30:37] <%CursedNobleman> @AnthraxJohnson CRAZY TRAAAAAAIN
[3:30:40] <Strider222> barret has mako poisoning
[3:30:41] <%Buzzard42> actually that's not true, Tifa went to the Nibelheim one
[3:30:41] <KaliasTV> Can't you hear the reactor callin'? I KNOW YOU CAN
[3:30:42] <dan_g_v> oh, we are going to hit a reactor. I hope everything goes according to plan! :3
[3:30:44] <%SABiscotti> Cannot in all honesty wait for Sailor Barret
[3:30:46] <%deserter_hedwyn> was barrett always this crazy?
[3:30:53] <%Buzzard42> yes
[3:30:54] <gekizenbu> yes
[3:31:01] <%Metballs> The voice really brings it out
[3:31:02] <+CelioHogane> yes

[3:31:08] <%Metballs> But he was always on
[3:31:12] <CptHarlok> I just think it's fucking hilarious when the suits on the train act like they want to start something with Barrett. I mean he's huge and has a goddamn minigun on his arm.
[3:31:12] <%goldenchaos96> @PanicSwytch more like 70% they got most of the end goal items to unlock the destination of the one piece
[3:31:12] <$Dakuu75> HEY GUYS!!! let's put a turret that shoots MISSILES on this flimsy platform. thousands of feet above ppl!
[3:31:24] <%CursedNobleman> @Onmi_Khaos weve been in the second reactor for ages now LUL
[3:31:27] <myriad_truth> Don't you wanna join Avalanche??
[3:31:30] <qo_op> just stand there and let me kill you SwiftRage
[3:31:42] <%Hellarussian> is Sephiroth the edgiest character in the FF series?
[3:31:48] <%Buzzard42> no
[3:31:56] <framewindowcleaner> lol no
[3:31:57] <dan_g_v> Zidane is the edgiest character
[3:31:58] <+SaltyGhostRock> yes
[3:31:59] <%MonsterEnvy> No
[3:32:01] <Tha_Mik> Squall
[3:32:03] <+zepelinnn1> sephiroth is not even top 5
[3:32:08] <%CursedNobleman> @Hellarussian Squall? Seifer? Kuja?
[3:32:08] <%collind99> I like the new Seph VA
[3:32:09] <Ipsenscastle> how is Zidane edgy?
[3:32:10] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> If Biggs is dead I swear
[3:32:12] <RichochetForce> @Hellarussian Nooj is.
[3:32:14] <Sokumotanaka> @Hellarussian No Kaius is
[3:32:16] <heartlesshealer> Nah, he's just goofy Kite
[3:32:17] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt BOOO
[3:32:17] <Malisin_Murder> BOO
[3:32:19] <%MonsterEnvy> Sephiroth is not even super edgey
[3:32:19] <+CelioHogane> BUT GILGAMESH HAS SIX SWORDS!
[3:32:21] <%SoFarFetched> That's quite a double edged sword you got there LUL
[3:32:22] <+Odysseusftw> boo
[3:32:22] <whalewoof> Dagger!
[3:32:26] <$lotharrio> BOO THIS MAN
[3:32:26] <%CappuccinoGuil> I mean.... technically correct???
[3:32:26] <cosmicgoatee> Cecil....
[3:32:28] <%Hellarussian> a lot of varied answers
[3:32:28] <%Dragovus> They're daggers not swords
[3:32:31] <%mighty_max_t> Maybe Paine from X-2
[3:32:32] <bestwaifuritsu> Greg has four arms LUL
[3:32:34] <dan_g_v> Vivi is the edgiest
[3:32:34] <Saltmeisterr> "i just like to watch"
[3:32:42] <%PhysicsLB> he uses twin blades, double the edgy
[3:32:43] <%Hellarussian> FF series has a lot of edgy characters it seems
[3:32:46] <Sokumotanaka> Whoever said Zidane is edgy is stupid
[3:32:46] <%SoFarFetched> Do you wonder tifa,cause your boobs get you off balance?
[3:32:48] <%Tucker0603> greg is the best
[3:32:49] <%Buzzard42> Cecil's pretty edgy
[3:32:50] <%weissguard> If 1 sword has 100% Power, then 2 swords is 200% power, right??? Kappa
[3:32:52] <+Parlux> pain from x 2 is pretty edgey
[3:32:52] <+CelioHogane> BUT GILGAMESH THO!
[3:32:53] <+Odysseusftw> listen to cloud try and flirt
[3:32:53] <%CappuccinoGuil> Oh my god, Barret, stop sounding like a preacher so much >~<

[3:32:56] <+Neoripo> Ok, that one was a bood joke
[3:32:58] <%Yummy_Nukes> ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper
[3:32:59] <saiyan24675> I thought Cecil was the edgy protagonist cause he was Dark Knight
[3:33:01] <hassanico2> Airbuster soon?
[3:33:04] <ElementalX1000> Gilgamesh has the most swords he wins
[3:33:09] <Ipsenscastle> Amarant was pretty fuckin' edgy
[3:33:10] <%mighty_max_t> Wait. There is LITERALLY someone named Edge
[3:33:11] <Gregorhasjoined> He just wants to look after his pet chicken, he's a good boy
[3:33:11] <%CopperTucker> the edgiest characters are the Dark Knights in FFXIV who have flavor text for every single skill
[3:33:12] <Strider222> kupo
[3:33:13] <LeaIsChill> Would Cloud smoke weed?
[3:33:14] <%doc_ock_rokc> Gilgamesh is greg right?
[3:33:15] <%CursedNobleman> @ElementalX1000 psaUp
[3:33:15] <+zepelinnn1> @sayyou are the wrongest

[3:33:24] <%aslfrasle> Doesn't Kefka's Tower have like dozens of arms?
[3:33:30] <Sokumotanaka> Techically Noctis has the MOST swords or bladed weapons
[3:33:31] <framewindowcleaner> Edgy, yet another word that now means nothing. Thanks Internet.
[3:33:33] <cosmicgoatee> @saiyan24675 no Cecil is the redeemed paladin he went from edgelord to Holy sword lad

[3:37:00] <%MonsterEnvy> It's his magic gun
[3:37:01] <heartlesshealer> He tanks
[3:37:02] <%collind99> Only characters that aren’t hot are the ones that are supposed to be gross

[3:41:20] <%Yummy_Nukes> psaElmo
[3:41:20] <shutupyouprick> Light Machine Gun
[3:41:22] <+blond_e> How far into the game is he?
[3:41:29] <%MonsterEnvy> Who knows
[3:41:31] <heartlesshealer> Does Focused Shot need two bars? I haven't paid too much attention
[3:41:32] <RichochetForce> @j0ustar No, Argent energy is Wraith Energy + Tortured Souls
[3:41:40] <Fep3> Chapter 7
[3:41:46] <%mighty_max_t> WHAT
[3:41:48] <+BigCoffee> lol chapter 18
[3:41:50] <+CelioHogane> CHAPTER 18!?
[3:41:50] <Dr_Mooose> 18 wow
[3:41:51] <jobbedbone> mako means dissatisfaction at the cooking of the planet
[3:41:52] <thetruthofyourbeing> HAHAHA
[3:41:52] <%MonsterEnvy> We are chapter 7
[3:41:58] <%Jp3g95> 18??
[3:42:00] <%Buzzard42> well consider that we haven't even blown up Reactor 5 yet
[3:42:00] <+blond_e> How many hours in?
[3:42:02] <%mighty_max_t> This a BIG game
[3:42:03] <dreamfillah> THERE'S EIGHTEEN CHAPTERS????
[3:42:05] <$lotharrio> When does the embargo end?
[3:42:07] <%j0ustar> @RichochetForce true I was focused more on the soul aspect
[3:42:08] <T_Sasquatch> What embargo ?? Game is out
[3:42:16] <%dukenux> Which chapter is this
[3:42:17] <+SaltyGhostRock> The whole game has been in the wild for a week but they put a limit on what you can show? LUL
[3:42:17] <+Neoripo> Isn't 18 the end of the game?
[3:42:18] <bestwaifuritsu> the game literally only has 18 chapters, they didnt want you to show the ending at all
[3:42:19] <+BigCoffee> chapter 18 is literally the end of the game
[3:42:21] <%JumbleJams> psaGib psaGib_HF
[3:42:25] <+CelioHogane> @dreamfillah i mean, i would asume there is MORE than 18 chapters, if after 18 was no show.
[3:42:26] <heartlesshealer> BARRET IS YOUR HEALER
[3:42:26] <%Jp3g95> Embargo can still be a thing after a game is out
[3:42:27] <rosemon5001> @CelioHogane the model they use in the menu when you do the secret episode is more polished and is in the same style as this games menu art
[3:42:27] <hassanico2> @T_Sasquatch Pat technically got the code prerelease
[3:42:29] <+caffienatedjedi> Embargo the game Australia has already shitposted the ending of?
[3:42:30] <%WhereIsWill> rekt
[3:42:31] <Strider222> ded
[3:42:31] <%Jp3g95> Persona 5 still has it
[3:42:35] <%BoomerUnchained> NotLikeThis
[3:42:39] <%MonsterEnvy> You need to remember ot heal
[3:42:39] <TurtleButter> Clap
[3:42:44] <dan_g_v> everybody is dead!
[3:42:49] <+BigCoffee> @bestwaifuritsu geeeee I fucking wonder why
[3:42:53] <Sokumotanaka> Summon chocobo!
[3:42:55] <+CelioHogane> @rosemon5001 you mean... KH3 DLC?
[3:43:02] <rosemon5001> yea @CelioHogane
[3:43:05] <heartlesshealer> Summon?
[3:43:11] <%Typhaeon> Noice
[3:43:18] <hassanico2> Can you go from PRESSURED to STAGGERED even if the bar is only half full?
[3:43:20] <%Piemen99> yeyyeyeyeye
[3:43:22] <%doc_ock_rokc> YOu....Did it
[3:43:24] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Man this dungeon is dragging on
[3:43:27] <jobbedbone> COKE GAMING
[3:43:38] <Fep3> Healz
[3:43:43] <+Odysseusftw> that does a lot of stager
[3:43:44] <+Overlordkain> pressured means increased stagger building, abilities with "focus" in their name have huge stagger rate increases
[3:43:47] <dan_g_v> now this is a gangbang
[3:43:51] <Ipsenscastle> why arent you using other charas atbs?
[3:44:05] <thetruthofyourbeing> i want tifa to beat me up
[3:44:08] <+blond_e> How many hours in?
[3:44:13] <Mpk674> heal
[3:44:19] <%SoFarFetched> !uptime
[3:44:20] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 44m.
[3:44:36] <Ipsenscastle> that wasnt meant to sound snide, i assume there's a strategic reason
[3:44:37] <ghostspartan80> steelskin sounds like a slur
[3:44:51] <+CelioHogane> MAIN CORE
[3:44:51] <%cowardman93> Pat switching off Tifa after doing unbridled strength instead of using her Triangle moves is driving me insane
[3:44:53] <+in_the_garden> Is pat liking the game so far?
[3:44:56] <RichochetForce> Horse Core
[3:44:57] <%SoFarFetched> yeah
[3:45:01] <+zinris> just look at the big ball in the middle
[3:45:01] <Domonomin> oh shit, whats this?
[3:45:29] <heartlesshealer> this is the tanking weapon, Pat
[3:45:34] <%nobodybutalex> the ball in the middle tells you everything you can get from that sphere
[3:45:41] <+tigerfang86> NICE JOB
[3:45:45] <%Spawntaneous501> F
[3:45:50] <thetruthofyourbeing> psadown
[3:45:50] <preppyposs> f
[3:45:52] <%BoomerUnchained> They tell you when it's done
[3:45:54] <zenith0111> @domonomin Weapon upgrades that also double as stat upgrades
[3:46:07] <%JumbleJams> psaDown
[3:46:09] <+CelioHogane> Does the buster sword not get a new materia core?
[3:46:11] <Domonomin> oooooh. thanks dude
[3:46:15] <heartlesshealer> Not self healing? Okay
[3:46:16] <%MonsterEnvy> It does
[3:46:24] <%MonsterEnvy> I think in it's third slot
[3:46:26] <TurtleButter> ...
[3:46:32] <%PanicSwytch> Do the stats stack on each weapon?
[3:46:38] <thetruthofyourbeing> psaDown psaDown
[3:46:39] <+CelioHogane> IT'S BACK, BABY!
[3:46:57] <Ipsenscastle> noice
[3:47:02] <heartlesshealer> Anything new with Tifa's?
[3:47:06] <NatetheHunter> Does tifa get new weapons as well?
[3:47:10] <qo_op> music is so in point
[3:47:12] <%dukenux> yes
[3:47:21] <zenith0111> Think of like KH3 upgrading
[3:47:25] <%Hellarussian> Rear Assault huh?
[3:47:29] <Monkeyweed21> Pegging buff
[3:47:30] <Strider222> hehe
[3:47:33] <+Mr_Turley> she could attack me from behind
[3:47:33] <@commanderclaw> Rear assault cause she wants to grab Cloud's butt
[3:47:38] <+FluxUmia> Hard fistin' from behind.
[3:47:42] <%cowardman93> Tifa exclusively goes from behind
[3:47:59] <%Metballs> Gotta get those positionals
[3:47:59] <%nobodybutalex> Just like in 14 Monk gets it's damage from behind sbfpRichard
[3:48:02] <heartlesshealer> Linked slot for damage loss
[3:48:03] <Explodincatz> that Buster sword is dead
[3:48:10] <+CelioHogane> Cores
[3:48:11] <boomstickery> focus your thrust pat
[3:48:12] <dreamfillah> ite doesn't have materia slotted in
[3:48:20] <Reireizei> someone mentioned Tifa feels like a FFXIV monk
[3:48:25] <Theonlypegsus> Tifa, Commence Strap on protocol
[3:48:32] <TDAWS_MP132> this is after upgrades
[3:48:36] <%rytyoung> Heck Yeah
[3:48:40] <+CelioHogane> Gotta wait untill reset, i guess.
[3:48:42] <zenith0111> Oh yeah Tifa would be a Monk, huh?
[3:48:45] <+FluxUmia> Wait, is the bustersword viable to just keep upgrading?
[3:48:47] <%BoomerUnchained> psaUp
[3:48:47] <hassanico2> Someone on my feed is showcasing his Butterfinger purchases for the Tifa PS4 theme...
[3:48:49] <%MonsterEnvy> Tifa is for sure a monk

[3:49:21] <%BoomerUnchained> Pat hates healing
[3:49:22] <Ipsenscastle> The combo slot on Buster is nice
[3:49:25] <straidulf> Barret is a shootman
[3:49:26] <Monkeyweed21> @Reireizei preacher
[3:49:27] <%Metballs> Barret is Machinist
[3:49:28] <zenith0111> @reireizei Gunner lol
[3:49:29] <%cowardman93> I've been using the buster sword at this point and slightly ahead. definitely viable

[3:50:09] <%Buzzard42> potion time
[3:50:09] <%PhysicsLB> you can multiuse: L1
[3:50:10] <+FluxUmia> That is actually super awesome! there were some cool looking swords that just dind't have the power, and the ultima weapon being the purple glowstick it was i would love to have a upgrade to ultimate weapon rather than just numbers making the blade the best.
[3:50:14] <RichochetForce> @Reireizei Benches have the oold save symbol sign on them.
[3:50:15] <%MonsterEnvy> No magic heal?
[3:50:18] <%VritraReiRei> @zenith0111 it was a joke
[3:50:18] <%Ascethetic> @PatStaresAt hold l1 while using potions
[3:50:22] <dmian07> Press L1 so you dont need to use potions like that
[3:50:24] <%Yummy_Nukes> YES A BENCH IN THE REACTOR CORE
[3:50:26] <%rytyoung> You can magic heal but it doesn't matter really

[3:53:41] <RichochetForce> @vonmaultke Shinra was always cartoonishly evil.

[3:53:44] <Mpk674> we are famous now
[3:53:46] <%joylent_blue> i thought he said SUPER RATS instead of sewer rats

[3:54:10] <%espanishcanamurciana> heya pat
[3:54:12] <framewindowcleaner> Shinra was always cartoony evil, but this new realistic tone doesn't help it

[3:54:27] <Theonlypegsus> WELP. I guess they should have worn some fucking disguises
[3:54:28] <%KasiCrafter> That report sounded so real.
[3:54:28] <%SilvaChariot0133> How much did Shinra pay that guy?
[3:54:29] <RichochetForce> @framewindowcleaner Wrong, it's great. Enjoy cartoonish evil. Realism has no place here.

[3:56:00] <+Dumb_Parrot> This RUN is OLDER than NARUTO, THANK you very much! xxxCHEEKY
[3:56:02] <framewindowcleaner> @RichochetForce No, but it creates a tonal clash between presentation, narrative and tone. That's not necessarily bad, but it happens.
[3:56:02] <+Tarage> Tifa's abs tho
[3:56:03] <+KilogramHours> IS IT?
[3:56:03] <+caffienatedjedi> Fake News!

[3:56:05] <+tigerfang86> OH NO ITS FAKE AS HELL NEWS
[3:56:07] <Zombrocom> How is it false though
[3:56:08] <Fep3> False?
[3:56:08] <Chaoko99> WEIRDLY SPECIFIC WORD CHOICE
[3:56:12] <ghostspartan80> played like a damn fiddle
[3:56:13] <+RayDaug> Man, ESRB has gotten pretty lenient on profanity, haven't they?
[3:56:14] <Monkeyweed21> You ARE Terrorists
[3:56:16] <Alseid> WHAT FALSE NARRATIVE? YOU'RE TERRORISTS!
[3:56:17] <asurite_warrior> but you were gonna blow it up
[3:56:19] <%Dementedpenguin> The HYPEST live show.
[3:56:20] <%LouieRouie> They played you like a damn fiddle
[3:56:24] <transporterthesequel> Is it false tho?
[3:56:27] <%Kirby_Sauce> weirdly specific posture
[3:56:29] <%Wolfstriker121> hes sold!!!!!
[3:56:31] <RichochetForce> @framewindowcleaner It's time to get used to it. Games cannot have it both ways. Realism and fun game mechanics and scenarios will always clash.
[3:56:33] <+KilogramHours> FALSE HOW?
[3:56:35] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> I'm sold on Tifa.
[3:56:36] <+tigerfang86> Damn those terrorists are SUPER HOT and SUPER GOOD AT MURDER
[3:56:36] <%WhereIsWill> MORALLY GREY
[3:56:36] <%PettyFunk> Those terrorists are so MORALLY GREY
[3:56:36] <+Buzzkill983> I mean, I would rather work for Heidinger and not Hojo
[3:56:37] <%Hellarussian> OH NO THEY'RE HOT
[3:56:38] <%코코꾸라> They're morally grey
[3:56:39] <heartlesshealer> those terrorists are bonkin'
[3:56:41] <%UvBenServed> And then the mech is filled with babies or some shit
[3:56:41] <%za7az> "Why are they so hot?!"
[3:56:41] <Ozmodyas> Remember, Morally Grey means crimes but also hot
[3:56:41] <hassanico2> I can't believe TeamFourStar predicted Heidegger being head of PR
[3:56:47] <dan_g_v> oh, I would let that terrorist girl smash me any time
[3:56:47] <asurite_warrior> You are terrorists!
[3:56:48] <%CursedNobleman> These terrorists look like theyre from one of my wutai animes
[3:56:49] <boomstickery> no great threat to authority than sexy terrrists
[3:56:50] <%PhysicsLB> this eco terrorism better not awaken anything in me
[3:56:50] <%cvp5127> Lets hear them out
[3:56:51] <metalwater8> Theyre so morally gray OOOH
[3:56:52] <zenith0111> @richochetforce Nice copypasta
[3:56:53] <%StaceMcGate> @hassanico2 damn it LUL
[3:56:54] <+Neoripo> We went through the door!
[3:56:54] <+FluxUmia> Yeah they killed a bunch of people, but did you see that sick ass giant robot fight?!
[3:56:56] <%JumbleJams> yall want final fantasy to be realistic?? it's always goofy!
[3:56:58] <%JohnAtDawn> Notice how no one will recognize Cloud after this even with this change that they have all seen him as a member on AVALANCHE.
[3:57:05] <framewindowcleaner> @RichochetForce Or use a more stylized art style, like most Indie titles. And, you know, the OG FFVII
[3:57:05] <%j0ustar> I mean, you could've just used masks and the cameras wouldn't have mattered.... but hey videogames
[3:57:12] <hassanico2> @StaceMcGate next thing you know the fucking Shintranet will be real LUL
[3:57:20] <%Koush> Airbuster has done his time, he deserves to be pampered
[3:57:21] <chickenhunter> why is it called the air buster
[3:57:24] <+caffienatedjedi> The Shinra soldiers look so good
[3:57:30] <%Kirby_Sauce> man
[3:57:31] <Shishi1205> "Let's do this" " ITs over"
[3:57:34] <californaya> EVERYTHING gets more play in this, and I've heard that as a bad thing from a bunch of people
[3:57:37] <boomstickery> the soldiers should know they have no chance by the way the 3 of them walk in the room
[3:57:37] <heartlesshealer> Close quarters combat against a man with Counter? Poor move
[3:57:40] <%narusao> fodder?
[3:57:42] <%Kirby_Sauce> these guys are just doing their jobs
[3:57:51] <%CursedNobleman> reminder that these guys are just asleep. its fiiiiine
[3:57:53] <clown_shoes> @j0ustar yeah, mask this bigass frame and the gun-arm of Barret's
[3:57:56] <ghostspartan80> literal jobbers
[3:57:57] <dan_g_v> Fire indeed hot
[3:58:03] <%pectusumbra> did that guy just say first day?
[3:58:07] <%narusao> Not OfficerB! He was my favorite officer! D:
[3:58:08] <Domonomin> oooo
[3:58:08] <RichochetForce> @framewindowcleaner Or you can engage with videogames like you do with movies: Suspension of disbelief. Being chained to reality is stupid and limits creativity. On top of that it's counter to the Final Fantasy brand.
[3:58:12] <Reireizei> I love Barret :D
[3:58:25] <zenith0111> It's time to get used to it. Games cannot have it both ways. Realism and fun game mechanics and scenarios will always clash.
[3:58:27] <+zinris> lightning
[3:58:30] <%WhereIsWill> used to be a HARD grind
[3:58:33] <%CursedNobleman> why are all these sleeping people getting absorbed into the lifestream?
[3:58:39] <Monkeyweed21> Lighting returns
[3:58:39] <boomstickery> @RichochetForce I wish a game series with fantasy in the title was more realistic kappa
[3:58:42] <+FluxUmia> yeah that is nice, materia took FOREVER to level in the old game.
[3:58:46] <Shishi1205> I like how japanese people use made up latin words for magic
[3:58:49] <ElementalX1000> rip growth system
[3:58:52] <%mield916> Barret became proficient
[3:58:56] <heartlesshealer> PHYSICS!
[3:58:59] <framewindowcleaner> @RichochetForce I'm not chained to reality, but with presentation. If the games estabilishes a serious and down to earth tone, if it deviates too much, it creates a tonal disconnect.
[3:59:06] <+CelioHogane> I can't believe you haven't gotten a new limit break yet.
[3:59:06] <%KasiCrafter> Donaldm Sora, Goofy, over here!
[3:59:07] <%Wolfstriker121> oooo
[3:59:09] <%j0ustar> @clown_shoes hey at least it would've been more effective than nothing at all in case of immediate recognition
[3:59:12] <+RayDaug> HEAT the key
[3:59:14] <$Dakuu75> Would the element-materia be better on Barret because all his bullets would trigger it?
[3:59:14] <+reaver93> Barret got his skill
[3:59:15] <%Hellarussian> he yell
[3:59:15] <Malisin_Murder> psaPorgmo

[3:59:30] <heartlesshealer> box physics <3
[3:59:31] <%PhysicsLB> @heartlesshealer what?!
[3:59:42] <+EaeItsJohnKylar> EaeItsJohnKylar subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months! 
[3:59:45] <framewindowcleaner> @JumbleJams Oh so?
[3:59:47] <NiktenKing> Linked Materia?
[3:59:48] <%barrakuta371> p p screem
[4:00:01] <RichochetForce> @framewindowcleaner There is no disconnect here that wasn't in the original. People with swords were beating heavily armed soldiers and machines in the original. If this bothers you, it's time to play ARMA 3 and iRacing for the rest of your life.
[4:00:06] <Torgue_1> Chat, did Pat get the materia on the other side of the bridge earlier?
[4:00:10] <%JumbleJams> @framewindowcleaner idk this seems like a werid hill to die on when we're talking about ff7 of all things
[4:00:11] <clown_shoes> @j0ustar true, but ehhh
[4:00:14] <+CelioHogane> @Torgue_1 yes, it was element
[4:00:20] <Malisin_Murder> Kappa
[4:00:21] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Damn right
[4:00:24] <heartlesshealer> @PhysicsLB Sorry, was being dumb over Pat running into the boxes
[4:00:26] <Ner234> any% Kappa
[4:00:28] <dan_g_v> no, don't put Lightning, we have had enough Lightning as it is
[4:00:31] <%TONYB333> @TONYB333 is new here. Say hello! HeyGuys
[4:00:31] <%CursedNobleman> @RichochetForce ehhhh. the OG didnt have jessie riding clouds back and crazy sick anime motorcycle fights
[4:00:32] <framewindowcleaner> @RichochetForceThe original game was super cartoony and goofy
[4:00:35] <Shishi1205> Like those chests you forgot in the demo area right? @PatStaresAt
[4:00:48] <$Dakuu75> SABOTAGE THE BOSS lol
[4:00:49] <+RayDaug> Now FREEZE the key
[4:00:50] <broostmonkey> Fight it without removing anything
[4:00:52] <%VoxelFox51> So, how is it so far? Whats the verdict?
[4:00:54] <%bread_assassin> Don't use the keycards on the M Units. They just give healing items. The other two weaken the boss.
[4:00:54] <Torgue_1> Nice. Had to step out, so I missed that part
[4:00:54] <ElementalX1000> ok but hell house
[4:00:56] <de1ete_forever> weaponized mind goblins
[4:00:57] <hassanico2> Do you think it's possible to fight this at 100% power instead?
[4:01:05] <+silvery_cricket> Dont let it set in Pat
[4:01:08] <zenith0111> @cursednobleman "Burn for me!" *Attacks Cloud with a Motorcylce* LUL You right
[4:01:09] <RichochetForce> @CursedNobleman It had ridiculous things like surviving a massive fall without being utterly crippled, or being gored by a super soldier. Let's not play this game.
[4:01:19] <+Odysseusftw> Cloud "i have no idea what im doing"
[4:01:19] <Chaoko99> HELL HOUSE WHEN
[4:01:21] <%AllenDeadman> HACKERMAN
[4:01:22] <SomersaultJustice> MAX ITEMS
[4:01:23] <WigglesTheDog> Beat this last night such a good game

[4:01:26] <+BigCoffee> yes
[4:01:27] <Khorneflakes_> oooooh
[4:01:28] <+zinris> no
[4:01:29] <+Tarage> YOU HAVE CHOICES
[4:01:30] <Onmi_Khaos> Wait
[4:01:30] <heartlesshealer> ???
[4:01:30] <%Hellarussian> fight on 100% difficulty
[4:01:31] <ghostspartan80> time to hack
[4:01:32] <%Tearonex> Choose wisely Pat
[4:01:33] <broostmonkey> NO
[4:01:35] <dan_g_v> cheat! Cheat! Cheat you cheating cheater!
[4:01:35] <LordOfThePoultry> no
[4:01:36] <%bread_assassin> Removing this just gives healing items. The others take away moves from the boss.
[4:01:36] <NiktenKing> But what if there are limited keycards?
[4:01:38] <+caffienatedjedi> How do you spend keycards? They aren't a currency.
[4:01:40] <%Wolfstriker121> so hard mode? if dont use any?
[4:01:41] <%JumbleJams> honey bee when
[4:01:42] <%코코꾸라> You have limited keycards
[4:01:43] <HeadsHeldHigh> COWARD
[4:01:44] <%j0ustar> see the other options- oh
[4:01:49] <Ipsenscastle> FIGHT IT HONEST PAT, I BELIEVE IN YOU
[4:01:49] <KaliasTV> wow, big cowardice
[4:01:51] <TurtleButter> Oh well.
[4:01:55] <+LtSquid> COWARD
[4:01:57] <Theonlypegsus> I'm confused
[4:01:58] <+BigCoffee> 5 keycards total
[4:02:00] <Onmi_Khaos> Wouldn't liquified materia just be mako/lifestream?
[4:02:00] <+Tarage> You had choices. You don't anymore...
[4:02:03] <+Neoripo> It will use the keycard
[4:02:06] <ghostspartan80> so does that machine eat your keycard lol
[4:02:07] <Reireizei> yes nerf the boss No dont nerf the boss
[4:02:11] <%bread_assassin> There's more further on.
[4:02:13] <%코코꾸라> You can save the keycard and go forward
[4:02:17] <heartlesshealer> where disposal room?
[4:02:22] <TurtleButter> there will be. Yeesh.
[4:02:22] <%JohnAtDawn> Doesn't the first room have just one?
[4:02:23] <clown_shoes> @Onmi_Khaos it's ether
[4:02:26] <%VritraReiRei> I wonder if there is the option to not nerf the boss? 🤔
[4:02:28] <FrankysDream> @PatStaresAt CHEST GO BACK
[4:02:28] <%Jp3g95> Do i spy people arguing about the goofiness of FF7? Kappa a man has a gun for an arm and Cloud has a sword the size of his body . Also DEMENTORS happened
[4:02:31] <%코코꾸라> It's ok
[4:02:31] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> you didnt watch that trailer then
[4:02:33] <%Hellarussian> use clairvoyance
[4:02:33] <%Partialrecall2> 4 more keycards, time to get BONKIN my guy
[4:02:35] <thetruthofyourbeing> Moonlight great sword falls from the ceiling
[4:02:35] <Darren716> It was very clear
[4:02:41] <%Ascethetic> @PatStaresAt word of advice, there is a limited amount of components that you can send. if you want money, go all disc drives
[4:02:44] <Malisin_Murder> :)

[4:04:02] <%Metballs> Do you maybe attack them? I dunno, but ti said you can pick up what you take out
[4:04:03] <heartlesshealer> no idea if Pat ever tried swinging at the glass
[4:04:04] <%Hellarussian> super does
[4:04:08] <+tigerfang86> it did
[4:04:10] <%Ascethetic> @PatStaresAt that "chest" one guy was tlaking about was just an encased M unit
[4:04:13] <%Ascethetic> you cant grab it
[4:04:14] <StryfeDragon> What does it mean by proficiency bonus?
[4:04:24] <Torgue_1> It did. Barrett took 50 dmg from Tifa
[4:04:29] <NiktenKing> @Metballs It said it was taking it to the disposal room
[4:04:34] <dan_g_v> stop with the energy drinks, Cloud. They are bad for your heart!
[4:04:38] <Onmi_Khaos> How long until you've mastered the skill and can use it regardless of weapon. It's FF9
[4:04:40] <Shishi1205> i remember DQ VIII had an option to full heal the party automatically
[4:04:47] <clown_shoes> hey, did he pick up the elemental materia in the sun-lamp place?
[4:04:48] <%JohnAtDawn> Wind has been annoying me so far. There are just enough enemies that you should keep it on, but they are spaced apart enough that I replace it with another materia every time, so then I don't have it when I find an enemy weak to it.
[4:04:54] <+tigerfang86> @clown_shoes yes
[4:05:08] <%Ascethetic> @JohnAtDawn thats been my problem with fire too
[4:05:32] <heartlesshealer> Defeat before item goes out????

[4:05:47] <dan_g_v> Imagine being these workers trying to finish the Airbuster, all the while they livestream shows all their coworkers getting destroyed and their hard work turned into a joke?
[4:05:48] <%Shady_Squid> These men are literally just doing their jobs. They're not even malicious...
[4:05:51] <%Hellarussian> I like the idea of a ranged tank
[4:06:00] <%ledgefiendd> Do you think the citizens watching at home know the guards are only sleeping?
[4:06:43] <heartlesshealer> MP Up since he's the healer?
[4:07:17] <%WhereIsWill> barret basically a paladin

[4:07:39] <%MonsterEnvy> There is a keycard
[4:07:40] <+Pyroclase> TBH he kinda fits the paladin archetype.
[4:07:44] <$lotharrio> ...D&D bow paladins are strong if I remember.
[4:07:44] <dan_g_v> Palagun? Gunladin?
[4:07:45] <%j0ustar> Gun Paladin sounds GREAT

[5:12:39] <$PulverKong> you people think this is "pure" FF7`? They've pulled out 40 hours for ONLY midgar. And most of the padding is horseshit
[5:12:40] <T_Sasquatch> Yea, everyone watch titans and the inhumans , coming to your nearest streaming service Kappa
[5:12:41] <CrazyMedicine> LUL That's my headcanon now
[5:12:41] <Ipsenscastle> just moseying
[5:12:41] <+DZiffer> So why are the dumb time ghosts not clearing the way, make the chandelier fall, etc? It makes no fucking sense
[5:12:42] <Sokumotanaka> He DID just wake up from a nasty fall
[5:12:42] <Sagata_> I feel this is going to be a different timeline of the original story
[5:12:42] <%Mantisman01> It's full of cement, obviously.

[5:14:11] <+SaltySombrero> You know, for what it's worth, the execution of 7's story in this remake has been pretty good. The Ghosts right now are bringing it back to Original 7's oddity. It's still good but now it's just weird again
[5:14:11] <+DZiffer> Was the original game actually already this super desperately horny?
[5:14:11] <$PulverKong> This is basically 35 hours of padding, 5 hours of FF7 storyline
[5:14:12] <Ipsenscastle> If you didn't let people complain you'd have to ban Plague
[5:14:12] <%BoomerUnchained> The cum jar MUST be filled

[5:51:05] <%floralkami> @europanlamprey well from all the complaints I've heard on the game so far, I've yet to hear a single one about the situation you've brought to the table. I really don't think the story has to hold the player's hand so much that they'd have to explain everything in such detail.
[5:51:07] <%tusk102> DOOR STUCK @PatStaresAt
[5:51:09] <illTemperedSeaBass> Aerith is the heiress to a Slumlord's fortune. Kappa
[5:51:09] <%PettyFunk> If I'm not watching I am having difficulty telling the difference between Paige and Aerith

[5:51:20] <%Djinnazz> Cuz you know you can never be?
[5:51:21] <try_it_sis_> she's not pure
[5:51:21] <TimetodiveLTX> it's easier to type aeris so i can see why the incorrect name is popular
[5:51:23] <%whiskey_wolfe_> Wait, is it Friday or Saturday?
[5:51:25] <Monkeyweed21> its fun to mock what you are not
[5:51:25] <hat_under_bread> Stiffing someone on payment isn't pure.
