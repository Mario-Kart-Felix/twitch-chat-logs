[0:15:17] <+Lamonticus> Oh okay. That's what I thought
[0:15:18] <+VariantX7> lol, he looked over at where elmo sat when the kavat meowed
[0:15:19] <%odiemikes> they are open to the idea of energy but they aren't convinced by any one type
[0:15:24] <1matheuw> damn looking good
[0:15:28] <LeftOverPizza13> bullet jump 150 times, aka just play the game
[0:15:29] <Jeemukun> get that GREEDY MILK Pat
[0:15:38] <InugamiTheHound> so this stock market of the future?
[0:15:39] <shazbot2019> I respect the new content but despise learning a third map for when I need fast cash money.
[0:15:45] <metrying> this is like a deathmatch arena?
[0:15:50] <+TechnicolorNinja> Grofit HO!
[0:15:52] <%Razputin217> 1 point LUL
[0:15:54] <%nyghtmare42> yellow waypoint is theirs
[0:15:58] <RaimeTT> is pat doing 3 wagers in a row?
[0:16:02] <SummonerMagno> limbo playing goalie
[0:16:04] <+OceanGovernor> Team deathmatch with debuffs for holding points
[0:16:09] <metrying> ty
[0:16:12] <+mrshazboto> You need someone playing goalie in this one
[0:16:17] <shazbot2019> it's more a Kill Confirmed variant
[0:16:19] <%doc_ock_rokc> @InugamiTheHound kinda this is future stupid civilization after the main one colapsed idea of what the stockmarket was like
[0:16:20] <mayorrev> this is basically football with guns and gambling @metrying @inugamithehound
[0:16:24] <+mrshazboto> otherwise enemy might pick up a spare point and ruin it
[0:16:32] <waifoong98> For what frame?
[0:16:33] <Shion963> kill enemies, pick up points, bring yourself with big points into enemy goal for points
[0:16:39] <%Valdorick> Limbo Goalie? GG.
[0:16:40] <+shallowjam> WHY is the announcer CLAPTRAP!?
[0:16:41] <arkv01> MAKUSU power
[0:16:43] <mayorrev> BROKER DED
[0:16:45] <Manwad> Just use radiation for big hitters, and viral/slash for status guns
[0:16:45] <%doc_ock_rokc> Limbo on goalie is good but atlas on goalie is best
[0:16:46] <shazbot2019> or like that thing in Quake 3 Team Arena where you get skulls from killing people and cash them in at your goal
[0:16:48] <InugamiTheHound> @mayorrev yeah I know that. I've played warframe and the index
[0:16:50] <mayorrev> SHUT THE FUCK UP ANYO

[0:18:10] <MasterDecoder> ORdis is second
[0:18:11] <Zebroneath> Everything is smooth
[0:18:12] <+mrshazboto> Didn't turn him down, just depends on how far you are from the speaker
[0:18:14] <%odiemikes> I'm out. hope you play samsho again soon. Peace everyone
[0:18:14] <greatersea> good on my end
[0:18:14] <pswayde> Oh my god, Pat is such a Warframe nerd
[0:18:25] <greatersea> also I'm excited to meet cephalon cy when railjack hits
[0:18:26] <MakeshiftSurgeon> Shy is a cruel mistress.
[0:18:46] <MasterDecoder> ^Cruel, but fair
[0:18:56] <%doc_ock_rokc> NEW SCREEN
[0:19:00] <RaimeTT> ?
[0:19:00] <mayorrev> STAY IN
[0:19:02] <ClumzyDragon> :o
[0:19:03] <Zebroneath> They updated the UI on a bunch of stuff
[0:19:04] <agustorm123> STAY
[0:19:04] <%doc_ock_rokc> but actually old screen
[0:19:04] <%Comradeiota> yo that's hype
[0:19:05] <Asuxley> oh yeah, they re worked the UI
[0:19:08] <InugamiTheHound> yeah its a new UI update for the PC and console
[0:19:15] <%Valdorick> Welcome to the new U-... I just got here 4 minutes ago and noticed his headband.
[0:19:22] <ClumzyDragon> FeelsAmazingMan new UI
[0:19:26] <waifoong98> Until you see the Relic UI, you will regret saying that
[0:19:30] <%Razputin217> also appears in defense and interception
[0:19:33] <MasterDecoder> @AngriestPat Have you not touched the new Jupiter yet? GO DO THAT
[0:19:38] <@mothmandraws> man this shadowbringers dungeon looks very different than what I expectd, very sci fi
[0:19:38] <+OceanGovernor> The relic UI is gross
[0:19:40] <InugamiTheHound> but they made equipping and upgrading relics much harder for relic missions.
[0:19:40] <+TintainiumCan> Honestly, I thought you were sporting an intense head wound Pat
[0:19:40] <%doc_ock_rokc> @waifoong98 it isn't that bad
[0:19:42] <shazbot2019> relic UI is ok once you acclimate to it.
[0:19:53] <ClumzyDragon> he is such a big strong sandy boy
[0:19:54] <dekkitout> I can't seem to wrap my mind around kits like Inaros' and Gara's
[0:19:56] <mayorrev> @angriestpat follow up question who's your favorite warframe npc
[0:19:57] <shazbot2019> but it's a bit of a clusterfuck at first.
[0:19:58] <pookam> inaros is Kid Mode from Superman 64
[0:20:00] <%Valdorick> Angry Martian Sandgod too Healthy to Die.
[0:20:03] <mooguls> so many particles
[0:20:05] <Solidus_113> @AngriestPat Have you played the game since Melee 2.99 released?
[0:20:12] <%doc_ock_rokc> @mothmandraws yeah once the 14 shards re merged it got weird
[0:20:16] <RaimeTT> nah
[0:20:17] <worldbrand> It's up there
[0:20:20] <Zoh87> no
[0:20:20] <+RenoDeGeneric> You can now upgrade relics mid mission, it's great
[0:20:25] <fatalDestiny> Nah, but it's up there,
[0:20:28] <Zebroneath> THey also changed the UI for the syndicate menu.
[0:20:31] <$Yakobro> @AngriestPat no shhh, don't ruin my riven disposition
[0:20:32] <%Varlinator> Recommend you check the syndicate section - You can now Fast Travel Everywhere
[0:20:33] <%nyghtmare42> fulmin's pretty tasty
[0:20:33] <CalderGaming> doesn't tombfinger do more single-target dmg?
[0:20:43] <greatersea> I miss quick attacks with sparring weapons, RIP hirudo
[0:20:45] <worldbrand> Melee hasn't really changed since the big quick melee change
[0:20:58] <Zoh87> catchm9on riven dispo continues to be nerfed into the dirt
[0:20:59] <waifoong98> @greatersea yeah, they took out the quickest attack
[0:21:01] <masterfire23> when is the DMC melee
[0:21:02] <MasterDecoder> Someone get him to do Disruption then the Ropalolyst fight!
[0:21:06] <waifoong98> @greatersea fucking awfullll
[0:21:08] <%Valdorick> RIP my Pyrana Riven
[0:21:13] <Admiral_PopnFresh> melee is probably I favorite part of this game, Jumping into a crowd of unaware mobs and swinging a stick like a spaz
[0:21:14] <%AncelDeLambert> yeyeye big knife kills
[0:21:15] <+TheSaintJohn> the new index arena is just terrible
[0:21:19] <%AncelDeLambert> instaDOOM
[0:21:24] <mayorrev> I've come to make an announcement: Nef Anyo's a bitch ass motherfuckef
[0:21:25] <Wan6Saber> damn
[0:21:30] <worldbrand> Yeah this map's lighting design is actually awful
[0:21:32] <+TintainiumCan> lytONEMORE
[0:21:36] <%doc_ock_rokc> @TheSaintJohn yeah its too big
[0:21:37] <Fien111> Is Pat just using a Meltapistol?
[0:21:38] <%AncelDeLambert> this map sucks, yeah
[0:21:44] <mayorrev> he pissed on my fucking wife
[0:21:44] <RaimeTT> are daggers still meta?
[0:21:48] <LeftOverPizza13> i made the same zaw and named it Raptor Claw @AngriestPat
[0:21:58] <%GarbageNirvana> Oh snap
[0:21:58] <dekkitout> Neato
[0:21:59] <waifoong98> @RaimeTT they never were?
[0:22:00] <%Agami23> the hell is dlss??
[0:22:01] <%doc_ock_rokc> OH SHIT
[0:22:01] <+Mittensbro> What the hell is DLSS
[0:22:01] <mayorrev> what's DLSS
[0:22:02] <%AncelDeLambert> @RaimeTT since they can insta kill if built right? yes.
[0:22:05] <metrying> sorry for the dumb question whats dlss
[0:22:05] <theshillman> DLSS?
[0:22:07] <ClumzyDragon> FeelsGoodMan
[0:22:08] <Rionxgarland> DLss?
[0:22:08] <Zebroneath> Forgive me, what is DLSS support?
[0:22:09] <%Razputin217> daggers need only one mod, Covert Lethality
[0:22:10] <Jeemukun> I made a nikana zaw cause i'm a fucking weeb
[0:22:12] <shinbuya> wat a DLSS
[0:22:15] <$rekinom> My dagger zaw is named Priscilla
[0:22:15] <pookam> hnnn....DLSS, huh?
[0:22:16] <%Verd_254> basically it means more FPS
[0:22:18] <dekkitout> Are AT Elders still kinda lame?
[0:22:19] <%Valdorick> I thank you for getting me addicted to crack, Pat, ironically, I joined 1 day sooner than some of my old WoW Friends, who don't even watch you.
[0:22:21] <+TintainiumCan> Now you just need to rename a gun "Tooth"
[0:22:21] <Fujiwara_92> what's dlss even
[0:22:21] <%king_wragles> Also Hallow Knight references are fun
[0:22:21] <$Timesteel> doesn't DLSS look like shit though?
[0:22:26] <StripesUltimateEdition> A friend named theirs "cool stick"
[0:22:26] <%doc_ock_rokc> Do you have covert Lethality?
[0:22:27] <+skm742> I went with 'Zawgger', because I'm not creative
[0:22:28] <%sshen> I called my zaw stabby :/
[0:22:29] <worldbrand> Covert lethality still does its thing but otherwise no daggers haven't been meta for non-backstabbable enemies
[0:22:31] <ValidVenasaur> It's just RTX antialiasing technique
[0:22:31] <metrying> whats dlss :(
[0:22:33] <shazbot2019> @dekkitout Inaros is a sand vampire. also with covert lethality he can oneshot anything with a finisher using his 1. that's all you need to know kitwise.
[0:22:34] <RaimeTT> @waifoong98 Should've said are they viable, my bad
[0:22:34] <MonstarGrrrl> cash in at 5 points
[0:22:43] <waifoong98> @RaimeTT ah np

[0:23:14] <%Verd_254> I'm getting 80-100fps in MHW now, launched it yesterday and thankfully it seems to have improved a lot, not more stutters.
[0:23:15] <%doc_ock_rokc> @111111sagas111111 get in and play you will ether love it or hate it
[0:23:20] <dekkitout> Eh, I'll pleb it up with Chroma for the meantime

[0:24:17] <Dragovus> Cat son
[0:24:27] <pochiyeah> its ur son? u fucked a cat WutFace
[0:24:29] <RaimeTT> they really need to fix mhw for pc
[0:24:36] <%alpharius88> n
[0:24:38] <Fien111> By the way, is that David Eddings?
[0:24:38] <TurtlesAndTentacles> I cant follow whats happening. it just looks like hes jumping and flipping around
[0:24:39] <+VariantX7> glad I just finished eating, cats love to do that when you start eating
[0:24:43] <MasterDecoder> Dailies Help though
[0:24:44] <+TheSaintJohn> I like the number changes but not some of the challenges they chose to keep around
[0:24:48] <InugamiTheHound> they still did the gilled equipment quest.
[0:24:51] <@mothmandraws> I cant tell what pats fighting
[0:24:51] <LeftOverPizza13> dailies add up to about 7k a week tho @AngriestPat
[0:24:54] <@mothmandraws> hes just moving
[0:24:57] <dekkitout> Put on Enemy Sense
[0:24:58] <worldbrand> The catchup is quite nice but be wary that some weeks you'll get things like "do 3 sorties" and you'll be locked for a few days
[0:24:59] <@mothmandraws> looks like fun tho
[0:25:01] <waifoong98> hope they change that stupid gilding and spend 3 forma shit tho, I hate wasting my resource
[0:25:10] <Dragovus> Enemies are cowards refusing to face you
[0:25:12] <IminyourBase> why is pat just jumping around this empty ship? OpieOP
[0:25:14] <worldbrand> @waifoong98 They're dropping the gilding one
[0:25:20] <%Valdorick> Pat is fighting Jobbers, whose literal jobs are being jobbers.
[0:25:24] <waifoong98> @worldbrand after this wave...
[0:25:33] <CalderGaming> with the possibility of enemies lagging their way past your view, Limbo goalie is a big relief for getting this nightwave weekly in a sane amount of time
[0:25:35] <worldbrand> They said it wouldn't show up in any weeks during this wave either
[0:25:35] <shazbot2019> That AI is being put into anti aliasing algorithms makes me feel weird as a comp scientist. I get the why behind it... and yet something about it feels super dumb and trend-driven.
[0:25:42] <arkv01> bieeeetch
[0:25:44] <worldbrand> any future weeks, anyway
[0:25:49] <trueGarnish> <3
[0:25:51] <pookam> 8eyes your dropped points*
[0:25:55] <+VariantX7> the gilding one makes no sense when you have all the modular weapons, you're just being asked to waste resources
[0:25:58] <arkv01> her voice acting is lovely
[0:26:02] <%Razputin217> Thanks, New Space Mommy
[0:26:05] <+TintainiumCan> "The Warriors"

[0:35:41] <Scrub_Seeker> @Ryutaryi looks to be a kitgun
[0:35:41] <InugamiTheHound> I have Equinox prime but I haven't started using her or mirage prime, limbo prime. @AngriestPat any advice on how to get them good?
[0:35:44] <+Mekhet09> I kind of want to play warframe again thanks to this but I don't play on my ps4 anymore and I don't want to just restart.
[0:35:50] <+Shillk> did a new patch come out or is pat just playing this for the big numbers?
[0:35:54] <laserbeaming> gotta use your 3 more often
[0:35:57] <+Ryutaryi> @Scrub_Seeker Thanks
[0:35:59] <$rekinom> Why only 300 hp?
[0:35:59] <mayorrev> sounds like a rattleguts? I wasn't paying much attention @ryutaryi
[0:36:04] <%Valdorick> I named my Virus/Radiation Ignis load out "warcrimes", is the true name.
[0:36:13] <laserbeaming> unless you dumped duration I guess
[0:36:14] <%doc_ock_rokc> @InugamiTheHound Look up a Niquilnox build. Equi is a good powerleveler
[0:36:17] <+PenmanLupine> why does Pats robot have a huge ass and child bearing hips?
[0:36:18] <mayorrev> baybeee
[0:36:25] <mayorrev> S RANK
[0:36:32] <+DisasterJensen> healers adjust
[0:36:35] <+VariantX7> he pretty much put everything in to her abilities and little into the defense so he needs to keep molt out constantly or get one-shotted
[0:36:37] <laserbeaming> @PenmanLupine Warframe is like that
[0:36:38] <+Epic_Fubar> how do you get so many SPORES!?
[0:36:39] <%doc_ock_rokc> @InugamiTheHound also Limbo is hard to level quickly but great at minimum range max duration for defense missions
[0:36:39] <dabirSA> @PenmanLupine would you prefer if it didn't?
[0:36:40] <greatersea> @PenmanLupine because warframe knows what we want
[0:36:44] <theshillman> @PenmanLupine because i need her to step on me
[0:36:45] <dekkitout> Sleepquinox

[0:36:57] <IminyourBase> equinox puts everything to sleep while slash procs kill them
[0:36:59] <dekkitout> Big range + sleep aug, imma guess
[0:37:01] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat Its a max range duration build built for sleeping
[0:37:03] <+VVardy> Does Pat have the Saryn augment that lets her heal when she molts?
[0:37:14] <wheelcake> it was a glitch
[0:37:14] <%Yadogari> Look at it?
[0:37:16] <pimpinahz> lol
[0:37:17] <+dirtyh4rr1> activate the streamer mode
[0:37:17] <IminyourBase> like you can even understand a spoiler in warframe LUL
[0:37:20] <%Valdorick> See what? I saw nothing
[0:37:20] <%GarbageNirvana> Just don't look! Just don't look!
[0:37:24] <%spiritofmojave> way ahead of you
[0:37:26] <@mothmandraws> spoiler pat dies
[0:37:27] <%FrostMass22> Warframe spoilers are like Jojo spoilers
[0:37:29] <greatersea> gotta molt
[0:37:29] <StripesUltimateEdition> the squishiness
[0:37:30] <worldbrand> He does have it but it doesnt appear to be equipped, I've noticed he wasnt healing when his molt was up
[0:37:31] <alextrebeken> he have a booster how howd he just get 40k focus
[0:37:40] <mayorrev> @angriestpat isn't there a streamer mode to disable spoilers?
[0:37:40] <LeftOverPizza13> @AngriestPat just use creator mode to avoid spoilers 4Head
[0:37:40] <%DraxTD> SPACE NINJAS apatDab apatHat
[0:37:40] <+DisasterJensen> I ruined 14 for myself on this stream
[0:37:41] <$SGrim> The spoiler is Pat sucks at Warframe
[0:37:41] <Pepebotellaw> F
[0:37:43] <GodlyLuigi> trinity
[0:37:44] <%PlainSimpleTailor> I'm immune to spoilers, as I bounced the absolute hell off of this game, just from the controls
[0:37:45] <+TheSaintJohn> that's a trin
[0:37:49] <RaimeTT> trinity
[0:37:53] <InugamiTheHound> streamer tax is affecting Pat
[0:37:54] <pimpinahz> lol seriously, a spoiler in Warframe just leads to way more questions.... so dont worry about it
[0:37:54] <GodlyLuigi> the coward path, nice
[0:37:59] <+dirtyh4rr1> MORE SPOILERS
[0:38:00] <+VariantX7> that trin should be casting bless to give some resistance to everyone
[0:38:00] <ScreamLord> Why is Pat wearing a Durag?
[0:38:01] <mayorrev> SPOILER
[0:38:02] <%Valdorick> Rez the Moa before you rez the - THAT'S A TRIN PAT, YOU'RE WRONG - the saryn
[0:38:04] <sonofthedeepsouth> oh no
[0:38:04] <%nyghtmare42> trin, Inaros, Saryn, ?
[0:38:15] <complicatedclarity> you can't see spoilers if they're invisible
[0:38:15] <%doc_ock_rokc> @nyghtmare42 wisp
[0:38:16] <sonofthedeepsouth> thats bullshit
[0:38:18] <worldbrand> two saryns
[0:38:21] <%Valdorick> Note your frame will still take damage
[0:38:22] <IminyourBase> afk frame
[0:38:22] <%nyghtmare42> thanks
[0:38:23] <alextrebeken> spores go up cause team killing for you
[0:38:28] <thecrispyones> you can't see spore count tho BibleThump
[0:38:28] <Pepebotellaw> Broken? BIG NOPE
[0:38:37] <arkv01> autofarm wars
[0:38:42] <waifoong98> u have none right now tho...?
[0:38:43] <clonexsniperx> they are Orks?
[0:38:43] <+dirtyh4rr1> revive your moa you monster
[0:38:46] <RaimeTT> no you have to kill spored enemies yourself
[0:38:46] <mayorrev> S P O R E S
[0:38:46] <+TheSaintJohn> they don't proc the spores if they die from the spores
[0:38:47] <laserbeaming> If the spores themselves kill it, the spores don't propagate
[0:38:47] <Manwad> and it shreds armor!
[0:38:47] <%Valdorick> Just leave that Moa to die
[0:38:47] <alextrebeken> spores only spread from non-spore based death
[0:38:48] <IminyourBase> and the spores shred yellow armor really fast
[0:38:48] <Jeemukun> i hate that you named your amp "shotty 2 hotty"
[0:38:48] <wheelcake> save the moa omg
[0:38:50] <shazbot2019> the spores are a bit more complex than that
[0:38:51] <$Garthunox> GREEN DAY
[0:38:53] <HeadsHeldHigh> press spore to win
[0:38:55] <crimsonwizahd> Is that Ash he's playing?
[0:38:56] <%Varlinator> MAX SPORAGE!
[0:39:00] <DoubledOgre> they stop spreading immediately, you're kind of just wasting time
[0:39:02] <dekkitout> Now I should make a Green Tea Saryn
[0:39:06] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat actually pat if they die to the spores it doesn't spread instead you have to kill enemies with spores to spread them
[0:39:07] <pookam> good luck doing this for 5 more waves
[0:39:08] <theshillman> pat leeching those S ranks
[0:39:08] <MoulesFritz> @AngriestPat spores only propigate from non-spore death
[0:39:10] <pimpinahz> S2W, spores 2 win
[0:39:15] <shazbot2019> you gotta shoot the spores, and patient zero will spread them automatically on death, BUT IF YOU FARTGAS THO...
[0:39:29] <laserbeaming> Yeah, fartgas makes spores kills propagate
[0:39:41] <%Valdorick> S2Wx2 Spin to Win Spores to Win
[0:39:43] <DoubledOgre> spores spread via her 4, the first death from her 1, and weapon kills with her 2 active
[0:39:46] <arkv01> do the water bottle challenge with your spores
[0:39:49] <shazbot2019> Saryn is deceptively intricate, and I love that about her
[0:39:50] <InugamiTheHound> so much fartgas!
[0:39:52] <%doc_ock_rokc> @shazbot2019 any toxic damage causes spores to explode
[0:39:57] <RaimeTT> yeah
[0:40:03] <crimsonwizahd> Is that a flamethrower?
[0:40:03] <MoulesFritz> Yeah, like that
[0:40:08] <IminyourBase> you can't pop spores anymore? just only when they die they spread?
[0:40:09] <%Valdorick> It is a flamethrower
[0:40:12] <waifoong98> "we fight with honor" heh, proceeds to gas everything
[0:40:15] <+Mittensbro> Just keep Saryn's 3 running and you can pop the spores no problem
[0:40:18] <pimpinahz> I love that gun
[0:40:19] <+dirtyh4rr1> More like, corrosive thrower
[0:40:20] <DoubledOgre> brapframe
[0:40:25] <MoulesFritz> @crimsonwizahd no, it's a mustard gas thrower
[0:40:25] <crimsonwizahd> I might need to unlock that flamethrower
[0:40:25] <pimpinahz> makes me all tingly lol
[0:40:30] <%doc_ock_rokc> @IminyourBase you can pop them with a pistol or toxic damage
[0:40:35] <RaimeTT> @IminyourBase you can with 3 but pat doesn't use it much
[0:40:35] <%nyghtmare42> the ignis is amazing
[0:40:36] <MonstarGrrrl> putrid pixie would of been better
[0:40:42] <laserbeaming> you can rename them for like 40 plat
[0:40:57] <waifoong98> u have reg molt on this build Pat?
[0:41:01] <%Valdorick> RIP - animation lock attack
[0:41:10] <InugamiTheHound> @crimsonwizahd yes its called the "Ignis Wraith"
[0:41:15] <IminyourBase> you're even using the slam style he recommended
[0:41:20] <DoubledOgre> I hate how they took away quick melee, most of the stances suck
[0:41:22] <anar_bael> so its the oroshi kirin? huh
[0:41:23] <TurtlesAndTentacles> my stream is skipping hard
[0:41:42] <shazbot2019> IgWraith is such a fun one. the bread and butter of elemental vomit.
[0:41:44] <+VVardy> oh fuck that crit
[0:41:46] <ScreamLord> There should be a Plasma Based Warframe called Kirin
[0:41:48] <%Valdorick> Oh god there are 2 saryns NotLikeThis
[0:41:48] <pimpinahz> @turtlesandtentacles so are Pat's crits lol
[0:41:49] <worldbrand> If you ask the right people they'll totally give you an ignis w for free, certain clans can generate an infinite amount of the blueprints. dont get scammed for one
[0:41:59] <drugbustincat> @TurtlesAndTentacles get better internet friend
[0:42:12] <shazbot2019> if you play on Switch Ignis Wraith is still Baro exclusive.
[0:42:12] <%nyghtmare42> and if you can't, Baro sells the ignis wraith
[0:42:14] <Thannen924> Simaris is so cool
[0:42:16] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Valdorick Oh no we can't warn them they have their airpods in
[0:42:19] <%nyghtmare42> but try for a free one off player first
[0:42:31] <%Deadpal> It's just bloodrush
[0:42:37] <%Deadpal> you're at 2.5x melee multiplier
[0:42:43] <LeftOverPizza13> probably harrow
[0:42:43] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@anar_bael) (warning)
[0:42:46] <ScreamLord> Simaris sounds like hespeaks in drunken slurs for the login rewards
[0:42:48] <pookam> borderlands
[0:42:52] <+Mittensbro> Just keep taping new mechanics onto the sides.
[0:42:55] <DoubledOgre> melee 3.0 never, we'll never get those devil triggers
[0:42:56] <Manwad> its an omnigame
[0:43:01] <+Mittensbro> What's that? You want Guns of Icarus? Just tape it on there.
[0:43:02] <alwayspronking> skateboarding?
[0:43:02] <%nyghtmare42> no heal on molt. rip regen molt mod
[0:43:03] <%Deadpal> It's the omegagame
[0:43:03] <dekkitout> It's gumbo
[0:43:05] <%ryome> Warframe is every game
[0:43:06] <%AncelDeLambert> and pretty soon it's gonna be Elite Dangerous
[0:43:06] <%Agami23> and soon it will be red dead
[0:43:07] <%Deadpal> Skateboarding yes.
[0:43:12] <ScreamLord> Devil May Cry
[0:43:12] <anon_1307> is going to be shadow of mordor too
[0:43:14] <TurtlesAndTentacles> to talk in all caps just make half the message in caps and the other half reg
[0:43:16] <%Deadpal> I've been grinding skateboarding on it lately.
[0:43:16] <talisign> Barbie Dreamhouse Adventure
[0:43:18] <+Shotgundam009> mario kart
[0:43:19] <Fujiwara_92> Skate 4
[0:43:19] <shazbot2019> warframe is the ultimate chimera a decade or so in the making.
[0:43:21] <+VariantX7> lol Guyver
[0:43:23] <%Deadpal> Incredibly expansive.
[0:43:25] <+Mittensbro> Shadow of Mordor? Tape it on there.
[0:43:25] <%Valdorick> Its becoming Rebel Galaxy
[0:43:25] <anar_bael> Do you think I like anime tiddies hunter? IRRELEVANT, HUNTER
[0:43:26] <DoubledOgre> meet n fuck 7
[0:43:27] <MoulesFritz> Goddamn Gravimo is just eating shit over and over
[0:43:28] <%Varlinator> It's The Oasis from Ready Player One.
[0:43:29] <+Genocalypse> Warframe: Shadows of Morder, Space GTA , Space Red Dead
[0:43:30] <%doc_ock_rokc> Do you want Shadow of Mordor! HERE IT IS
[0:43:36] <+VVardy> Melee 3.0 is going to add a Devil Trigger
[0:43:37] <Storm_Samurai> Just me or is that frame kinda EVA Unit 1 lookin
[0:43:37] <+Riseskimo> hoping for an excal radial javelin rework...
[0:43:37] <Zoh87> and somehow despite all that there is no content
[0:43:41] <pimpinahz> lol
[0:43:45] <%Deadpal> especially if people in ANY mission not just open worlds can jump into helping emperyean modes
[0:43:48] <%GarbageNirvana> I'm all for more chimera games
[0:43:51] <%skizzuto> It's a Warframe
[0:43:53] <%doc_ock_rokc> It even has its own rocket league...but it SUCKS
[0:43:54] <worldbrand> It's <insert game steve has been playing>
[0:44:02] <InugamiTheHound> don't forget about the fishing
[0:44:02] <ShichiNoBushi> Oops! All Games!
[0:44:03] <Paperware> The Omni-game
[0:44:07] <Shion963> the ur-game
[0:44:08] <shazbot2019> the gumbo genre, one might say.
[0:44:11] <%ThatOneGameTester> I classify it it as one of the true Video Games of this era. Nier Automata also fits that classification.
[0:44:20] <%Valdorick> 0 spores
[0:44:21] <%badmr7> hell, they're doing a new orbiter design too
[0:44:23] <DoubledOgre> decaying monnkaS
[0:44:25] <waifoong98> it has the Conclave Kappa
[0:44:28] <%Varlinator> Chicken Palm: The Game
[0:44:31] <%doc_ock_rokc> whats the trend lets chase it
[0:44:31] <GodlyLuigi> Pat, have you seen what this game looked like when first beta released
[0:44:40] <%Valdorick> Leave Moa to die, you fools!
[0:44:40] <SummonerMagno> i guess everytime someone says "what if.." at DE, Steves eyes just light up
[0:44:41] <+Mittensbro> They're reworking the entire ENGINE too, if Steve's not just blowing smoke out of his ass
[0:44:44] <Thannen924> There is an article describing how Empirean maps works and, from a game developement perspective, it's very interesting
[0:44:48] <shazbot2019> the only thing Warframe is missing is an elegant host migration solution.
[0:44:58] <ScreamLord> Speaking of Chimera I still haven't crafted the Paracesis yet
[0:45:05] <worldbrand> They've already completely reworked the visual engine several times
[0:45:07] <%doc_ock_rokc> what
[0:45:10] <%Deadpal> yep
[0:45:10] <%doc_ock_rokc> wha
[0:45:10] <Shion963> it was 800mb back then
[0:45:12] <%Varlinator> Huh?!
[0:45:15] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> you mean dark sektor?
[0:45:16] <%doc_ock_rokc> OH YEAH
[0:45:17] <InugamiTheHound> I remember that trailer
[0:45:18] <+VariantX7> lol yeah it was like a mass effect type game but with some ninja moves
[0:45:18] <%spiritofmojave> really? like 2013?
[0:45:19] <Fujiwara_92> yup
[0:45:19] <worldbrand> graphics are one of steve's domains, he's probably not talking out his ass there
[0:45:19] <DoubledOgre> and john dark sector from dark sector is coming back
[0:45:20] <lordzaskez> dark sektor
[0:45:20] <+TheSaintJohn> Dark Sector doesn't count
[0:45:21] <%Deadpal> Dark sector is what they took from it
[0:45:24] <%Deadpal> dark sector DOES count
[0:45:25] <ScreamLord> Dark Sector
[0:45:25] <%doc_ock_rokc> I was intrested in dark sector
[0:45:26] <%ryome> Warframe is like one of those games they have in shows about the future
[0:45:26] <+VariantX7> it was dark as fuck too
[0:45:28] <+dirtyh4rr1> dark sector
[0:45:28] <anon_1307> darksector pat
[0:45:29] <%Deadpal> it was originally going to be warframe.
[0:45:30] <+Epic_Fubar> Wait WHAT
[0:45:31] <%spiritofmojave> that's a long while ago
[0:45:32] <+TheSaintJohn> Dark Void was the flying game
[0:45:34] <worldbrand> Dark void is a different game
[0:45:37] <DoubledOgre> dark void LUL
[0:45:38] <Reanimator83> They’re pulling good ideas from games and adding it to their own SeemsGood it just works
[0:45:39] <+dirtyh4rr1> Crazy talk going wild
[0:45:40] <Scrub_Seeker> dark void was a different game lol
[0:45:41] <%Agami23> remember when the game had skilltrees? @AngriestPat
[0:45:42] <1matheuw> dark sector pat
[0:45:42] <InugamiTheHound> dark sector
[0:45:45] <waifoong98> LUL
[0:45:45] <thecrispyones> LUL
[0:45:45] <Thannen924> Yeah and at the time there was a Femscalibur in the trailer
[0:45:47] <%Deadpal> Dark Sector was TURNED INTO the modern russian shooter game
[0:45:47] <shazbot2019> I want DE to shill Dark Sector lore more
[0:45:48] <talisign> Oh, balls, on stream
[0:45:49] <+rendingmelody> LUL LUL
[0:45:49] <pimpinahz> lol gotta love all those AAA games cant get this type of game right, and here comes this F2P game and just out plays them in every way possible
[0:45:49] <%Deadpal> by a publisher
[0:45:50] <+bubbli97> LUL
[0:45:51] <dekkitout> Void, Sector same difference
[0:45:51] <%Valdorick> Pat is wrong, balls exposed, live on stream
[0:45:51] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@Caidezes) (warning)
[0:45:51] <%Deadpal> AFTER that trailer
[0:45:52] <DRAGKUDO> almost altered the timeline with that shit
[0:45:57] <Zebroneath> We don't TALK about Dark Void
[0:45:58] <greatersea> @AngriestPat do you wanna hear a frame/weapon combo that really pushes frame rate with the amount of particle effects?
[0:45:58] <ClumzyDragon> dark void rooWut
[0:45:58] <DoubledOgre> dark void is the shitty capcom one with vertical flying and emilia airheart
[0:45:59] <%RioGascar> See
[0:46:00] <HeadsHeldHigh> dark void was the jetpack shit
[0:46:01] <%spiritofmojave> the memorable Dark Void LUL
[0:46:02] <%RioGascar> Words are hard
[0:46:03] <+VariantX7> lmao pat is genuinely sorry for that
[0:46:04] <mayorrev> Is pat's spoiler child bald? LUL
[0:46:05] <voltage996> Fake fan
[0:46:09] <Ghostars> I thought Dark Sector was all about Haiden Tenno? Like, one guy, but it did have the grineer in it.
[0:46:11] <GodlyLuigi> i meant more like the ingame ui but yeah that was a thing too
[0:46:13] <+dirtyh4rr1> @AngriestPat Did you see hayden tenno at the duviri paradox trailer?
[0:46:16] <%doc_ock_rokc> Dark void had potential and they SQUANDERED IT
[0:46:21] <InugamiTheHound> in dark sector they have excilbur and Nyx in that game and you can buy those skins for them in warframe.
[0:46:27] <+DingusMcFadden> More like WarLAME!
[0:46:28] <+Mittensbro> Yeah, but Hayden Tenno was wearing Excalibur's armor
[0:46:31] <+DingusMcFadden> ...And I'm spent
[0:46:33] <%Valdorick> "Wake the fuck up, Tenno, we got a Void to Burn"
[0:46:35] <+DingusMcFadden> Thanks everyone
[0:46:35] <ScreamLord> Dark Void was a weird jetpack game based inside the Bermuda Triangle during World War II
[0:46:36] <MoulesFritz> leave Gravimo to die, he can't stay up for 10 seconds
[0:46:38] <+DingusMcFadden> Goodnight
[0:46:38] <Tennochief> hello
[0:46:52] <waifoong98> using pet on not high HP frame LUL
[0:47:00] <anar_bael> a plague too successful for itself
[0:47:08] <pimpinahz> @valdorick can you just imagine Keanue in Warframe lol
[0:47:12] <DoubledOgre> even with inaros the stupid pets die
[0:47:13] <talisign> Watching Pat stream The Sacrifice was my first exposure to this game. I was so confused back then.
[0:47:14] <%rumtumtugnutz> isv tyhat a Warframe dewrag?
[0:47:17] <%doc_ock_rokc> Inaros
[0:47:25] <Reanimator83> And I thought you were a nerd Pat. For shame
[0:47:26] <anar_bael> fuckin hell, thats a low health pool
[0:47:33] <$rekinom> Smeeta Kavat for 'dem double resource drops
[0:47:34] <shinbuya> go now
[0:47:34] <waifoong98> @DoubledOgre god can't save their stupid AI
[0:47:39] <worldbrand> who needs vitality when you can just die all the time?
[0:47:42] <%Deadpal> he's not using a healtth mod on saryn
[0:47:42] <Ghostars> Wait, Pat, you're a founder? I had no idea O_o
[0:47:44] <Vohs_Bru> Pat wants WAVES!
[0:47:45] <%Deadpal> so it looks lower health
[0:47:54] <shazbot2019> essentially the Warframe we know and love is a fork off of the original pitch for Dark Sector before the retool. WF itself was built off of assets first made for OG Dark Sector, which helped a lot during their financial emergency hail Mary moment.
[0:47:59] <ScreamLord> Founders Pack? Do YOU have Excalibur Prime Pat?
[0:48:04] <%doc_ock_rokc> Sar is the best against infested
[0:48:14] <dekkitout> The Hive- Flood- I mean, the Infested HATE corrosive
[0:48:23] <Tennochief> FRAUD
[0:48:23] <+dirtyh4rr1> HAT
[0:48:25] <%Deadpal> did your friend go grandmaster or just excal only
[0:48:26] <mayorrev> HAT
[0:48:30] <%Deadpal> cause I went excal prime only
[0:48:34] <spinalwizard> theeeeere it is
[0:48:35] <pimpinahz> space hat... say no more
[0:48:36] <GrandMazterNelson> Hatdanna
[0:48:38] <Fujiwara_92> HAT
[0:48:38] <%doc_ock_rokc> @dekkitout they hate viral more
[0:48:39] <+VVardy> Almost as good :)
[0:48:40] <hntronium> Banhata
[0:48:43] <ScreamLord> Umbra's better than Excal Prime anyways
[0:48:48] <Ghostars> Warframe is a game about hats on space dolls, now pat has space hat for his real head
[0:49:01] <hntronium> Pat is just an earth doll
[0:49:05] <ClumzyDragon> hat > excal prime
[0:49:07] <+nekodelic> Is this game still fun after you become OP as fuck?
[0:49:09] <Tennochief> and cooler
[0:49:13] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Ghostars its a scifi themed warframe simulator
[0:49:14] <Thannen924> @nekodelic Yes
[0:49:16] <waifoong98> no need for potatoes too LUL
[0:49:16] <ScreamLord> Both in design AND stats
[0:49:17] <pimpinahz> @nekodelic yes
[0:49:18] <%Deadpal> I like how they changed umbra excal from the china version
[0:49:19] <+Chronobot> Being OP IS the fun
[0:49:19] <%Valdorick> Being OP as fuck makes it BETTER
[0:49:20] <mayorrev> They have more umbras planned yeah?
[0:49:20] <dekkitout> I hate his scarves unfortunately
[0:49:21] <%Deadpal> he's so much better now
[0:49:24] <LeftOverPizza13> I remember all the anger from founders when umbra released @AngriestPat
[0:49:25] <deviljhojho94> what is that thing on pat's head
[0:49:25] <%Deadpal> yes
[0:49:28] <Ghostars> @doc_ock_rokc I know, I'm a MR 27 Founder :)
[0:49:28] <+Mittensbro> @nekodelic It depends on if you like games not being difficult at all
[0:49:32] <+dirtyh4rr1> it was chinaframe's founder warframe
[0:49:33] <%Deadpal> if you're op as fuck there are challenges that are wayyyy different
[0:49:37] <%Deadpal> pat have you ever done arbitrations?
[0:49:40] <shazbot2019> If New War does space adults but there's no Hayden Tenno appearance preset then we have a problem.
[0:49:41] <+Mekhet09> Pat stop making me want to replay this. I'd have to start over.
[0:49:42] <ClumzyDragon> it is super fun being OP as fuck
[0:49:42] <%Deadpal> no
[0:49:45] <worldbrand> It's a collector's game, by the time you're OP it's not about fun
[0:49:46] <%Deadpal> most founders were not mad.
[0:49:46] <pimpinahz> totally agree
[0:49:47] <Pixel_gee> being op is when this game BECOMES fun
[0:49:48] <%Gogogolem> Hoes mad
[0:49:48] <Tennochief> some were
[0:49:49] <LeftOverPizza13> yes @AngriestPat
[0:49:52] <$rekinom> HOES MAD
[0:49:56] <mayorrev> HOES MAD
[0:49:57] <talisign> Plus, you can make more, different OP frames.
[0:49:57] <TyrantBelial> As a grandmatser founder.
[0:49:58] <Zoh87> its even more fun, I just play with guns and swords and theyre all great
[0:50:00] <TyrantBelial> No.
[0:50:02] <shinbuya> founders were FUMING
[0:50:03] <TyrantBelial> Most p[eople didn't care
[0:50:04] <TURBOSUPLEX3000> ho mad (x1)
[0:50:05] <Ghostars> I'm cool with Umbra, cos I'm getting my second umbra forma on Excalibur Prime >n>
[0:50:07] <$rekinom> (Thank you for supporting warframe it would not be here for me to play but also hoes mad)
[0:50:07] <tangoragahn> Pat turn on Toxic lash please, my goblins
[0:50:07] <Inebriateddonut> i wasn't mad
[0:50:08] <spinalwizard> certain hoes indeed mad
[0:50:11] <worldbrand> There were a few hoes mad on the forums but basically everyone else didnt care
[0:50:12] <TyrantBelial> Maybe 10% of founders were shitflinging as much as possible
[0:50:13] <Superblooms> ironic cause i never feel like i'm leveling up.
[0:50:14] <%Valdorick> You can do it!
[0:50:19] <+Cybercobra2> yea i love just pumping up my atlas more and more and mroe. PUNCH SOLVES EVERYTHING
[0:50:20] <%Valdorick> Do it a little harder
[0:50:22] <JaeStereo> the whole Excal debate has been going on way too long, people jsut need to chill and enjoy the game now.
[0:50:27] <Reanimator83> Is Pat cosplaying a white ninja?
[0:50:32] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat Yes all 3 of the of people with excal prime were mad
[0:50:40] <%titans_ace_jerid> Non-founders push the "FOUNDERS ARE MAD" meme a lot.
[0:50:42] <+VariantX7> Being OP feels right in Warframe because thats what the game is selling and its amazing when you finally get your character to live up to what the game is saying that you're essentially seen as a god of war
[0:50:47] <ScreamLord> Excal Prime: Bleach Excalibur and spot weld a Void Key to his face. Excal Umbra: Make it looks like a cool ninja with a scarf
[0:50:49] <%Valdorick> No, Pat is Cosplaying the game Plague Inc
[0:50:54] <+VVardy> Red Crits for days
[0:51:07] <mayorrev> LUL
[0:51:09] <Tennochief> I've turned all of my warframes into all 18 primarchs
[0:51:28] <TyrantBelial> Most people in the founder only chat didn't care.
[0:51:28] <worldbrand> It is a really pretty shotgun skin
[0:51:32] <Ghostars> @AngriestPat I'm not mad that umbra is better than my prime... I'm mad that he looks cooler ; n;
[0:51:32] <+Ryutaryi> Vaykor looks fine, damn it
[0:51:32] <+TheSaintJohn> Kraken is the ugliest
[0:51:37] <thecrispyones> Pog
[0:51:37] <shazbot2019> wait who hates Heks?
[0:51:38] <Tennochief> Vaykor Hek is fine
[0:51:40] <LeftOverPizza13> vaykor hek looks great fuck you
[0:51:41] <axtonunbound> smol pat with big numbers go
[0:51:41] <dabirSA> vaykor hek colours terribly
[0:51:41] <%Deadpal> on the SECOND nyx deluxe skin
[0:51:42] <%doc_ock_rokc> Stop tempting me to spend money
[0:51:42] <worldbrand> If you equip it on the beam shotguns, the beam comes out of the trigger though
[0:51:43] <dekkitout> So I can how have a *Not* Tigris, neat
[0:51:44] <waifoong98> Ugliest, nah, that's the Brakk
[0:51:46] <spinalwizard> is a hek
[0:51:46] <%Deadpal> not the FIRST nyx deluxe skin
[0:51:47] <jestrfestr> i dont wanna buy a skin for nyx shes terrible
[0:51:52] <CalderGaming> if only nyx were useful
[0:51:55] <%nmaten> the fact that its not tigris prime?
[0:51:56] <+OceanGovernor> the nerf gun part is the fun
[0:51:56] <fatalDestiny> The vaykor hek would look fine if it didn't colour like garbage,
[0:51:58] <%Valdorick> But the Vaykor Hek isn't my Tigris Prime 4Head
[0:51:59] <Tennochief> that is the opposite opinion
[0:52:01] <Fujiwara_92> HEY IS COOL SHUT UP
[0:52:04] <worldbrand> I carry profit-taker with nyx, y'all stay mad
[0:52:04] <+VariantX7> Vaykor Hek does ugly things therefore it SHOULD be ugly as what it does.
[0:52:05] <Inebriateddonut> Corinth for life
[0:52:06] <%nyghtmare42> god I wish I liked Nyx more
[0:52:08] <%Panther2103> apatSkelmoney

[0:53:51] <shazbot2019> @drugbustincat Tenno in Dark Sector was always just one person: Hayden Tenno. the Tenno of Warframe are a separate thing, though the name is in reference to the original pitch.

[1:06:35] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat I'd suggest getting the viper Wraith

[1:20:51] <RyuuAoi> Just do EVA
[1:20:53] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> it's definitely one of the better color palettes
[1:20:59] <+Pookiedaexzile> I'm late to the party, why is he wearing a hat
[1:21:10] <+Pookiedaexzile> or bandana
[1:21:13] <%kiiiirsten> LMAO I didn't even notice pat was wearing something on his head until you said that
[1:21:15] <Tennochief> Megaman
[1:21:17] <%Valdorick> Its such a good color palette and it doesn't cost Plat!
[1:21:17] <televisedrevolting> Pat looking at Warframe colors like a couple who just bought a house looking at wallpapers.
[1:21:18] <CelioHogane> @Pookiedaexzile That's clearly a bandana
[1:21:19] <bear_breaker20> just do EVA ... again...
[1:21:24] <Nekros4442> So I wonder with all the new renderer coming up in Warframe if we'll be able to manipulate the materials on our Frames to make em look more organic or metallic
[1:21:24] <RyuuAoi> @pookiedaexzile He's bald BabyRage
[1:21:25] <Shion963> it's the Founders pack bandana
[1:21:31] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Yeah, get that purple/green combo out of here. This ain't Woolie's stream
[1:21:33] <%killfrost11> killfrost11 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! 
[1:21:37] <dekkitout> If you're using 1 pallet, hit random
[1:21:39] <+Mekhet09> @lonlononion *** here's how you check
[1:21:43] <17sevens> I came to this stream expecting gameplay, the moment it turned on I realized I was idiot
[1:22:00] <%doc_ock_rokc> i'm gonna get food y'all have fun for a while
[1:22:03] <Tennochief> you're watching Pat, all of us are idiots
[1:22:04] <%ShogunNoonto> your space doll looks like twitch
[1:22:05] <%Valdorick> Warframe has gameplay? I thought coloring my dolls was the game.
[1:22:05] <jestrfestr> you dont sadly
[1:22:06] <%Comradeiota> That's what randomize iws
[1:22:06] <Scrub_Seeker> @17sevens what do you mean this is the real game
[1:22:09] <Inebriateddonut> Randomize only takes from 1 pallete
[1:22:09] <MasterDecoder> You don't
[1:22:13] <+WyvernsArentDragons> can't do that unfortunately
[1:22:14] <RyuuAoi> @angriestpat, do you still want to German Suplex Mother Teresa?
[1:22:16] <Cobaltor_252> don't hit randomize
[1:22:16] <+ZaneJules> I always want to try this game........but then I look at anything about it and get overwhelmed
[1:22:17] <+Pookiedaexzile> Just do complimentary colors, add some yellows and look away constantly to balance you eyes
[1:22:18] <televisedrevolting> Go for classic Hyperion colors.
[1:22:19] <Thannen924> randomize always uses one palette
[1:22:22] <waifoong98> Hit random colors until it pick that pallette...
[1:22:23] <+Pookiedaexzile> we get used to colors as we see them
[1:22:28] <turretgunz> Wukong yet?
[1:22:33] <dabirSA> yeah but it also picks that palette at random
[1:22:35] <waifoong98> RNG
[1:22:39] <+VVardy> Now that's an Egyptian Anubis biomechanical man if I ever saw one
[1:22:44] <Tennochief> SYLUX
[1:22:45] <%doc_ock_rokc> @ZaneJules if you need a friend to guide you through yell at someone on the TBF subreddit
[1:22:48] <televisedrevolting> Turn your Warframe into a Conference Call.
[1:22:50] <Tennochief> You made Sylux
[1:23:06] <%kiiiirsten> apatBig Fashion Souls
[1:23:08] <dabirSA> just paint him all gold
[1:23:09] <Nekros4442> Black makes everything better
[1:23:10] <%Valdorick> And just add a happy little tree, right there on his shoulder.
[1:23:12] <+Pookiedaexzile> I want to paint it black

[1:24:14] <+VVardy> Oooh Jadey
[1:24:14] <Tennochief> big glows
[1:24:17] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Try making a bloo glow
[1:24:18] <IminyourBase> just the one tho
[1:24:19] <worldbrand> You can ditch the glow by setting the energy to black
[1:24:24] <worldbrand> If you wanted to
[1:24:28] <RyuuAoi> I'm feelin' a gold and white design
[1:24:31] <Cobaltor_252> IMUGI
[1:24:31] <%Razputin217> Fashion Frame is End Game
[1:24:37] <Cptn_Turtle> What's the best overall pallet to get?
[1:24:39] <RyuuAoi> With that armor
[1:24:39] <waifoong98> Imugi looks better
[1:24:43] <IminyourBase> isn't that the quake symbol or something?
[1:24:46] <%kiiiirsten> Who wants to be cool when you could be hot pink????
[1:24:52] <%doc_ock_rokc> it has great color intreactions
[1:24:53] <worldbrand> oh it's the emissives
[1:24:55] <%Valdorick> Edo chest attachment is amazing - it gives you an energy breastplate when you get hit or do anything that 'lights up' your frame.
[1:25:02] <+Pookiedaexzile> yelloe
[1:25:03] <+Cybercobra2> nah i like the green better
[1:25:04] <%GarbageQueenEllie> yeyeye
[1:25:05] <+Pookiedaexzile> dull yellow
[1:25:15] <televisedrevolting> Give it the Hyperion colors.
[1:25:17] <IminyourBase> give it a white glow
[1:25:22] <RyuuAoi> "Pat Stares At Fashionframe"
[1:25:32] <%sshen> This is the stream now
[1:25:34] <+Pookiedaexzile> Look color is easy, Pick a color, then pick its compliment, but also make sure ones saturated and ones supper unsaturated
[1:25:35] <detritus25> So am I also to understand Warframe is just one of those new ground fashion games but Scifi?
[1:25:39] <+Pookiedaexzile> so the saturated one pops
[1:25:42] <+mrshazboto> That's NICE
[1:25:45] <+Kareem405> nice
[1:25:46] <%Valdorick> Nailed it

[1:26:15] <+eshafferart> What about that green glow in the chest
[1:26:21] <InugamiTheHound> those shoulder pads look like a energy sword from halo games
[1:26:22] <detritus25> H I G H F A S H I O N
[1:26:22] <+eshafferart> can you make the eos prime shoulders match that bit
[1:26:33] <Tennochief> we need more full armor chests
[1:26:48] <+Cybercobra2> yea i still like the green more tbh, but its your warframe
[1:26:52] <RyuuAoi> Now make me a full sized mech exactly like it!
[1:27:00] <sonofthedeepsouth> Pat has beautiful dolls
[1:27:07] <%kiiiirsten> Makin' your way downtown
[1:27:11] <sonofthedeepsouth> The back

[1:27:17] <OldOnyx> just play the- oh, right this IS the game
[1:27:18] <RyuuAoi> Lookin' good and feelin' gorgeous
[1:27:18] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Pat is the best at playing with dolls
[1:27:20] <%Valdorick> Baller
[1:27:20] <IminyourBase> it almost looks like the chest piece comes up to the face
[1:27:27] <maxwell_adams> put on the kiteer sehkara
[1:27:27] <@Mechz71> haha Pat thinks he is cool
[1:27:28] <+Cybercobra2> F
[1:27:40] <waifoong98> the syrinx clash, it is too matte
[1:27:41] <$RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat you currently look like one of those "ancient masters" from a shitty hollywood kung fu film from the 80s with that headband. It's great. LUL
[1:27:48] <+Cybercobra2> that syndana btw? god tier
[1:27:48] <InugamiTheHound> that front chest pieces looks like Issac's suit chest piece from dead space
[1:27:49] <$Dakuu75> just looks like a lot of overly-ornate blady-blah to me.
[1:27:53] <+rendingmelody> now throw on the limbo animation set and it will be perfect
[1:27:53] <BlueLunecy> Why does the Warframe launcher take forever to "check for new content" NotLikeThis
[1:28:02] <$RubberFistFight> @Dakuu75 space hats are very important.
[1:28:02] <Tennochief> Syrinx looks good but DAMN do they fucking clash
[1:28:02] <worldbrand> I like the riv min set from conclave, but the downside is getting them
[1:28:21] <Cobaltor_252> the porta legs didnt look too bad
[1:28:27] <%GarbageQueenEllie> This almost looks like Cecil's armor pallet
[1:28:30] <waifoong98> Foros looks good yeah
[1:28:34] <Tennochief> perfection
[1:28:44] <+eshafferart> Looks dope
[1:28:45] <+WyvernsArentDragons> Sekhara makes almost every frame look better
[1:28:48] <%Valdorick> Don't even need shoulders, you got Ki'teers
[1:28:58] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@dirtyh4rr1) (warning)
[1:29:01] <Tennochief> what abut the sekhara chest?
[1:29:08] <Zoh87> i feel bad if i dont tep the clan and alliance tho
[1:29:08] <Tennochief> does Pat have that?
[1:29:08] <%Gogogolem> I don't get why pat likes inarous so much.
[1:29:10] <+Pookiedaexzile> I just wanted to chime in that if your funny you can get people to pay you to watch you play with dolls
[1:29:14] <%rumtumtugnutz> that looks like an owl
[1:29:20] <Tennochief> nvm you do
[1:29:22] <waifoong98> Yeah, you better without shoulder on this Inaros skin, because when you move, you can see the shoulder just float on the side
[1:29:27] <Tennochief> it's the kite'teer chest
[1:29:30] <detritus25> So as someone whose never played Warframe is it just Halo: Reach armor customization +?
[1:29:30] <%Valdorick> That does look good
[1:29:34] <%rumtumtugnutz> looks dope
[1:29:34] <+Cybercobra2> umbra does fit in nicely
[1:29:35] <GrandMazterNelson> ResidentSleeper
[1:29:36] <+eshafferart> Don't cover up the green glow, Pat
[1:29:38] <+eshafferart> Keep that
[1:29:40] <+eshafferart> it's important
[1:29:41] <Tennochief> @detritus25 yes
[1:29:49] <Jaller101514> Inaros the Abysswalker
[1:29:54] <Shion963> I appreciate the devs going back and putting PBR on stuff, butI wish they'd implement Anthem-like material picking
[1:29:57] <King_thunder365> It looks pretty cool.
[1:29:58] <Thannen924> @AngriestPat Do you know you can have a Roomba on your ship now ?
[1:30:30] <+Cybercobra2> yea that looks great
[1:30:32] <+DukeMoose> @thannen924 but then itd clean up the litter
[1:30:33] <+rendingmelody> excess plat? buy a roomba
[1:30:35] <televisedrevolting> Is it possible to make a Space Marines-esque Warframe?
[1:30:40] <+Cybercobra2> A+
[1:30:40] <%GarbageQueenEllie> solid look
[1:30:41] <waifoong98> @Shion963 attica on suicide-watch

[1:30:57] <%Comradeiota> SSStylish
[1:30:58] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> now I'm wondering what your nidus looks like
[1:30:59] <IminyourBase> i don't like that blue with that green
[1:30:59] <%Valdorick> I do have to wonder - how many Roombas did Pat donate to the cause?
[1:31:08] <detritus25> All that customization. Just to get bodied.
[1:31:10] <televisedrevolting> Now color code your weapons.
[1:31:10] <+Cybercobra2> i wish atlas had mettalic skin
[1:31:12] <+CryoConduit> It's almost cheating though. The Ra skin is sexy as fuck to begin with
[1:31:12] <Shion963> @televisedrevolting not really? there's Rhino for bulk but not the cylindrical
[1:31:13] <%Dylveryn> Why don't you have a baby elmo running arounf the orbiter @AngriestPat
[1:31:14] <%Valdorick> How many MAGS has he donated to the cause!?

[1:32:14] <Tennochief> that is nothing like Indigo
[1:32:15] <%rumtumtugnutz> Jesus. BIG purr.
[1:32:16] <%Valdorick> Its not blue
[1:32:17] <+eshafferart> It's arguably indigo
[1:32:21] <+Cybercobra2> its very on the edge blue
[1:32:23] <3xgilly> thats gamecube
[1:32:23] <JaeStereo> plz feed elmo
[1:32:25] <+Golinvoxx> elmo is purple

[1:32:30] <TurtlesAndTentacles> i hate that head
[1:32:33] <%GarbageQueenEllie> I like the idea that Pat transferred his soul into a freaky alien robot body and took elmo with him
[1:32:33] <%Valdorick> Baba is Blue
[1:32:33] <+Pookiedaexzile> unsaturated blue sorry
[1:32:35] <caja_de_ojos> heal

[1:32:44] <%Derc127> I dont want another color argument
[1:32:44] <waifoong98> blame the texture works LUL
[1:32:51] <worldbrand> Yeah sometimes the colour maps are slightly tinted and it throws things off
[1:33:00] <%doc_ock_rokc> I want another color argument
[1:33:02] <Tennochief> ultra glossy at times
[1:33:06] <+Cybercobra2> its becouse inaros got the GOOD textures for his skin
[1:33:07] <Shion963> yeah that shiny metal material is bonkers
[1:33:09] <Ne0classical> Hey I started playing warframe last night. Any advice?
[1:33:12] <damdash16> Previous head was better IMO on inaros
[1:33:12] <Tennochief> Hydroid Prime has it the worst
[1:33:18] <Giothegame> Just imagine how it will all look when the new engine is put into place
[1:33:19] <loganbntn> 6 years of material upgrades will do that
[1:33:27] <detritus25> Also what is Pat wearing on his head. Looks like the Hulk Hogan dorag.
[1:33:28] <Shion963> @ne0classical clear star chart and level all weapons to 30
[1:33:32] <%Valdorick> @Ne0classical Buy a frame slot with your starting plat.
[1:33:32] <%GarbageQueenEllie> I like his whiskers. So cute
[1:33:34] <waifoong98> Hydroid prime color segment is digusting
[1:33:36] <mayorrev> feed him pls
[1:33:36] <NickelCanvas> this game has dog customisation!? I gotta play it now jeez
[1:33:39] <waifoong98> 80% primary color urghhh
[1:33:40] <InugamiTheHound> @Ne0classical go through the star chart and play with some friends and make a clan.
[1:33:54] <Inebriateddonut> @Ne0classical make your way through the star chart, get buff, then do quests when you feel ready. Or just explore at your leisure
[1:34:04] <$RubberFistFight> Pat playing this on the PS4? Or is the game intelligent enough to have PS4 icons when a DS4 is used on the PC?
[1:34:05] <+Genocalypse> The Kavat skin for sale down in Cetus is actually pretty cool looking

[1:34:30] <%arkv01> looks blue to me, you crazy color people
[1:34:31] <waifoong98> nah, it is just dark desaturated blue
[1:34:39] <complicatedclarity> big blue
[1:34:39] <detritus25> It's very blue pat.
[1:34:41] <NickelCanvas> looks orange
[1:34:52] <televisedrevolting> Indigo is a shade of blue
[1:34:54] <%doc_ock_rokc> its a warm dark desaturated blue
[1:35:02] <Batty_Bane> its a Good color
[1:35:10] <Zombrocom> Honestly, you could call that blue or purple and I wouldn't disagree
[1:35:10] <waifoong98> if you want real purple, just get Twillight palette
[1:35:11] <%rumtumtugnutz> Indigo is not a shade of blue.
[1:35:12] <%doc_ock_rokc> its the elmo of colors
[1:35:17] <Tennochief> LUL

[1:35:22] <+Cybercobra2> gave me a fucking heart attack
[1:35:26] <$RubberFistFight> @Valdorick that's pretty cool actually. Not many games do that, they just load the default Xinput icons and go "figure it out"
[1:35:26] <+eshafferart> keep it green
[1:35:32] <Cobaltor_252> dude you almost gave me a heart attack dont do that
[1:35:33] <%ShogunNoonto> apatBig apatHoldon
[1:35:33] <centipede1994> ben 10
[1:35:33] <+eshafferart> KEEP THE GLOW GREEN PAT
[1:35:40] <Ne0classical> Also I did a quest and got a wukong blueprint? Should I try and make that?
[1:35:41] <+Cybercobra2> twilight is very saturated
[1:35:45] <Zombrocom> Do you have Gamma?
[1:35:45] <IminyourBase> now we're talking
[1:35:46] <eanscrale> try easter?
[1:35:51] <detritus25> It might the dark hue on the Warframe making it appear more blue.
[1:35:58] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Maybe keep the original color, and switch out the lightng?
[1:36:00] <Zoh87> too bad he missed gamma from intermission nw
[1:36:01] <$RubberFistFight> If they included a saturation slider or even a H/S/V colour picker they could give you practically infinite options.
[1:36:04] <Shion963> try the legacy palette option?
[1:36:06] <Nineball_Luce> Bottom of Corpus has a dark purple IIRC
[1:36:06] <narusao> this purple needs less purple in it
[1:36:12] <loganbntn> Could have gotten Gamma during intermission :P
[1:36:13] <televisedrevolting> I want my Warframe lookin' like a goddamn comic book.
[1:36:13] <+Cybercobra2> oh hell yea
[1:36:13] <%arkv01> smokin'
[1:36:16] <+eshafferart> Mtn Dew Midnight Rush
[1:36:17] <+Pookiedaexzile> It started when alien device did what it did
[1:36:20] <detritus25> There we go.
[1:36:20] <NoirePanzer> Get some Twitch Prime purple going Pat Kappa
[1:36:22] <$RubberFistFight> @narusao needs more blue Kappa
[1:36:23] <+YabbaTroll> @Ne0classical you should try to make every frame as long as you have the materials, just leave em in the foundry if slots are an issue
[1:36:29] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> atta boy
[1:36:31] <complicatedclarity> woolieframe
[1:36:31] <IminyourBase> that's a better color
[1:36:32] <Tennochief> the previous colors were better
[1:36:36] <narusao> moar blue
[1:36:48] <%arkv01> do people just have frame orgies at warframe con
[1:36:56] <+Pookiedaexzile> Now he's got superpowers he's no oridnary kid
[1:37:00] <%arkv01> and upload it to the secret sections of pornhub
[1:37:02] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Look at this Reboot
[1:37:02] <CalderGaming> @angriestpat speaking of green and purple, have you seen the July 6th Evangelion 3.0+1.0 prologue?
[1:37:03] <%MeatClackin> Should go with the participation ribbon.
[1:37:03] <televisedrevolting> I think it's just the quality on my phone, but now it looks obsidian.
[1:37:26] <waifoong98> @televisedrevolting more or less
[1:37:39] <%Maloane> FashionFrame hell yeah
[1:37:45] <Tennochief> LUL
[1:37:46] <%Valdorick> You know... yeah, it looks like the energy is flowing into your hole
[1:37:56] <%arkv01> time to give elmo prime to the SPCA
[1:38:00] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Nice and subtle to simulate the void of space
[1:38:01] <Shion963> Friendship with Elmo prime ended
[1:38:02] <%goose_attack_almanac> MechElmo Prime
[1:38:06] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat Why don't you have a roomba in your orbiter?
[1:38:14] <3xgilly> LUL
[1:38:15] <detritus25> Sometimes you just gotta wonder. Why must I watch this ginger goblin play with their Scifi dolls.
[1:38:17] <+eshafferart> go back to blue
[1:38:28] <+Kareem405> put on the ribbon
[1:38:33] <IminyourBase> sunken chest inaros
[1:38:42] <Fujiwara_92> go back to purple Kappa
[1:38:50] <%GarbageQueenEllie> I'm digging that beat
[1:39:05] <%Valdorick> apatWhat didn't get toxin during ESO as Saryn!?
[1:39:07] <Tennochief> note to self: recreate 20 bounty hunters for my warframes later
[1:39:08] <+eshafferart> go back to the stone age
[1:39:25] <televisedrevolting> Man, has anyone made an image of a Warframe looking in the mirror, trying to pick a chest plate.
[1:39:39] <waifoong98> LUL
[1:39:41] <dekkitout> I'm sure it's on the subreddit
[1:39:42] <%nyghtmare42> yep
[1:39:42] <Tennochief> they're going to fix it soon
[1:39:44] <+Flaming__Rhubarb> Everyone hates that
[1:39:47] <Zebroneath> That gilding one is the worst
[1:39:48] <MasterDecoder> GO LEARN DISRUPTION
[1:39:49] <Thannen924> Disruption is the new mission mode
[1:39:51] <Fujiwara_92> yup
[1:39:53] <waifoong98> Spend thy formas
[1:39:55] <bonzosan> the truest grind.
[1:39:58] <complicatedclarity> bad time simulator
[1:39:59] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Are you proud of your dolly?
[1:40:06] <OldOnyx> did I miss the ropeadopealyst?
[1:40:08] <Inebriateddonut> DIsruption is kinda fun actually
[1:40:24] <MasterDecoder> @OldOnyx Hasn't touched it
[1:40:29] <SummonerMagno> do at least one ropopo
[1:40:36] <OldOnyx> ah, thanks
[1:40:39] <+Tokanova> hey pat your robot has a nice hat
[1:40:42] <Tennochief> goodbye death
[1:40:44] <%Agami23> ew hexis
[1:40:46] <waifoong98> LUL
[1:40:55] <+VariantX7> its fun when you can take down the demolysts...frustrating as hell when your build does nothing against them especially if they get a speed buff
[1:40:55] <socratetris> Was gone for Disruption too... I find Disruptions to be a bit hit or miss. If the rest of the team doesn't know what to do, they can be hard to carry on your own
[1:40:57] <Tennochief> Arbiters are cool
[1:40:58] <waifoong98> ah capture in a nutshell
[1:41:05] <+Cybercobra2> @AngriestPat you might also wanna explore new jupiter
[1:41:12] <%GarbageQueenEllie> I really like the character movement in this game. It's so floaty, like you're a graceful murder fairy.
[1:41:16] <waifoong98> 70% of the mission is running to extraction
[1:41:17] <Tennochief> The arbiters are like a counsel of jedi or elders that you report to
[1:42:06] <%AncelDeLambert> sweet, and that's the nightwave for this week done for me
[1:42:14] <caja_de_ojos> @tennochief like talking to your grandma
[1:42:23] <%Razputin217> apatBig PISS
[1:42:24] <CalderGaming> someone yell at pat so he knows to listen for the demolyst noises
[1:42:28] <detritus25> You're rocking way to much style for these jobbers.
[1:42:33] <GPAlpha> Urine Prime
[1:42:35] <%AncelDeLambert> and now to grind for monkey prime, I guess
[1:42:37] <Tennochief> @caja_de_ojos but I love my grandma
[1:43:15] <caja_de_ojos> @tennochief i didn't say it was a bad thing
[1:43:33] <Thannen924> Disruption is simple when you know how it works
[1:43:34] <Tennochief> true
[1:44:04] <%AncelDeLambert> disruption is no big thing, I just fail to see the reward of doing it
[1:44:06] <Tennochief> but it is nice to pretend like they're a shadow council or something like that
[1:44:38] <suikudo> !uptime
[1:44:38] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 44m.
[1:44:54] <Tennochief> hi
[1:45:07] <MasterDecoder> @AncelDeLambert Getting to the Ropalolyst is the reward
[1:45:18] <brows_> For a second, I thought was unironically wearing an American flag bandanna LUL
[1:45:37] <%supercasualboom> The hell is on Pat’s head?
[1:45:52] <dekkitout> His *not* durag
[1:46:06] <IntrepidEye> Is that a Lotus cap?
[1:46:10] <+eshafferart> true warframe experience
[1:46:10] <+Taglog7> I thought he was blindfolded for a sec
[1:46:11] <%AncelDeLambert> @supercasualboom a Warframe headband that was given to original players
[1:46:14] <bonzosan> a bandana that gives pat unlimited ammo.
[1:46:18] <Tennochief> Founder's bandana
[1:46:18] <%AncelDeLambert> a friend gave it to Pat
[1:46:19] <InugamiTheHound> @supercasualboom a warframe found's bandana he got from a friend
[1:46:25] <waifoong98> people actually go look for medallions?!
[1:46:35] <+eshafferart> Warframe and Castrum Meridanium share the same energy
[1:46:42] <LeftOverPizza13> @waifoong98 yes
[1:46:43] <MasterDecoder> @waifoong98 Yea, they help now and then
[1:46:52] <%AncelDeLambert> it'd be nice if the medallions were worth standing that doesn't use your cap
[1:47:13] <MasterDecoder> @AncelDeLambert I used some recently that didn't eat at my cap
[1:47:13] <+SolverCODO> let me iiiiiiiiiiinn
[1:47:22] <%Nymphonomicon> apatMenace apatMenace apatMenace
[1:47:39] <%AncelDeLambert> I always put a waypoint down at the elevator, gets people moving
[1:47:41] <%Goodbye_Jojo0> that's rude pat
[1:47:51] <sonofthedeepsouth> Rude Pat
[1:47:59] <+SolverCODO> awoooooooooooo
[1:48:02] <waifoong98> Lanky scream LUL
[1:48:06] <+VariantX7> wtf??
[1:48:07] <%AncelDeLambert> sipsipRude
[1:48:10] <%shadyesq> Stand Cry
[1:48:12] <mayorrev> wolf salute is cool
[1:48:16] <%strugglepunk2> That's just eva
[1:48:16] <dekkitout> Berserk Eva intensifies
[1:48:19] <%AncelDeLambert> Wolf awoos
[1:48:21] <phrickshun> I gotta ask a real question... I haven't REALLY played warframe probably since 2014 I have NO idea how to get back into it. There's actually too much new stuff now. Wat do?
[1:48:33] <SephirKath> ^
[1:48:34] <+Cybercobra2> man what a cool dude
[1:48:39] <%AncelDeLambert> @phrickshun complete the star map as much as possible to start
[1:48:43] <%RioGascar> God damnit
[1:48:47] <Tennochief> start basic on the ground level and then work your way up
[1:48:52] <%AncelDeLambert> after that, farm whatever weapon or frame fancies you
[1:48:56] <mayorrev> i fuckin hate interception
[1:48:59] <%Unlimited_> yeah rio is a boomer within a milennial body
[1:49:04] <mayorrev> pain in the ass to do it solo
[1:49:05] <Inebriateddonut> @phrickshun do starchart get buff do quests when buff and continue from there
[1:49:07] <phrickshun> It's actually funny how much new content was added. I played this in the beta too, haha.
[1:49:08] <waifoong98> @phrickshun just follow the quest and the map unlocker mostly
[1:49:14] <InugamiTheHound> interception suck balls
[1:49:15] <%AncelDeLambert> gilding is a pain when you already have everything you want
[1:49:16] <+Golinvoxx> @AngriestPat but pat that operator skin
[1:49:17] <fatalDestiny> Yeah, don't bother, I really hope they remove those,
[1:49:19] <+FrostedZaibatsu> Dont you need to actually go to TennoCon for that headband?
[1:49:21] <waifoong98> @phrickshun that's how I got back 3 years ago
[1:49:26] <alextrebeken> @phrickshun finish star chart and you figure out more as you go on
[1:49:36] <Tennochief> I hate it whenever someone thinks it's a good idea to abandon their post
[1:49:39] <phrickshun> Thanks for the advice, y'all
[1:49:43] <%Unlimited_> @FrostedZaibatsu not when you have the plug
[1:49:53] <Tennochief> see
[1:49:57] <+SolverCODO> weird
[1:50:02] <worldbrand> It's... well, you're there
[1:50:02] <+eshafferart> invisible tower
[1:50:02] <HibikiYamada> if anyone wants a fun time i suggest watching total biscuit's first warframe video.
[1:50:03] <%AncelDeLambert> Interception is easy as SHIT ever since I was shown the Frost method
[1:50:05] <%Goodbye_Jojo0> its there, its just bugged
[1:50:09] <HibikiYamada> it's crazy
[1:50:12] <%Valdorick> If you complete all your Nora Chores next week, she'll give you some you missed the week before, if I recall right?
[1:50:13] <%AncelDeLambert> Frost makes interception FASCILE
[1:50:13] <alextrebeken> its cuz we're adicts and we fans and want you with us phrick
[1:50:16] <Tennochief> ??????
[1:50:16] <+FrostedZaibatsu> >_> thats BS, @Unlimited_
[1:50:19] <thwak> good job capturing that tower pat
[1:50:22] <+Midashu> Game sometimes gets buggy when other people host
[1:50:22] <worldbrand> UI in interceptions break a lot
[1:50:24] <+SolverCODO> that's super broken, ya
[1:50:27] <Tennochief> 2/4=100
[1:50:30] <waifoong98> holyshit old bug and it is still present
[1:50:31] <+VariantX7> at least this aint the sucky uranus map
[1:50:42] <%AncelDeLambert> oh fun, it's that bug where the UI doesn't load in
[1:50:45] <chambatron> You're just that good pat
[1:50:48] <LeftOverPizza13> 4 tenno but not all the towers are taken. odd
[1:50:49] <chambatron> It's not broken
[1:50:53] <%GarbageNirvana> Fun how you can just point that at things and they melt
[1:50:58] <detritus25> Nah Pat is wearing that Hogan Bandana.
[1:51:00] <Tennochief> 50% = passing grade, just like high school
[1:51:00] <SummonerMagno> good old DE
[1:51:03] <$RubberFistFight> I just watched that 10 minutes of the new Eva movie. It was 10 minutes of spectacle with important details present but obfuscated.
[1:51:06] <complicatedclarity> whoops
[1:51:07] <phrickshun> I remember this game when it only had the corpus tile set and no cards.
[1:51:08] <$RubberFistFight> So basically more of the same, lol
[1:51:09] <%Valdorick> His UI bugged is all. SHOULD fix itself next wave?
[1:51:09] <+SolverCODO> Doesn't have status immunity? what kinda inaros is this
[1:51:12] <%sshen> small indie dex
[1:51:12] <imshadow_35> Pat do you have Mesa yet?
[1:51:14] <phrickshun> how do they afford to add so much content
[1:51:19] <chambatron> Can you get banned on twitch if you put panties on your head?
[1:51:23] <IntrepidEye> Amprex is good? Had no idea. I've been sitting on a rank 1 one for like three years
[1:51:27] <%Valdorick> It was blue all along
[1:51:33] <waifoong98> "Small indie dev of over 100 ppl crew" hehe
[1:51:36] <%AncelDeLambert> but yeah, pro tip for everyone, get the globe mod for Frost and then drop a globe on top of every interception point. It'll slow down all enemies, making it harder for them to recapture
[1:51:40] <+Cybercobra2> yellow lighting in here
[1:51:43] <+Pozitive_Possum> is this game any good?
[1:51:55] <eanscrale> lighting is a tricky thing that, all the grineer tilesets are very yellow
[1:51:57] <ScreamLord> WTF why do you have normal Space Mom? SHouldn't it be Glitch Mom?
[1:52:00] <detritus25> No but seriously what is that on pat's cranium.
[1:52:08] <Tennochief> Founder's bandana
[1:52:09] <%GarbageNirvana> It's pretty fun
[1:52:09] <InugamiTheHound> at tennocon 2019 I saw a amazing Inaros cosplay
[1:52:10] <worldbrand> I mean I like it
[1:52:10] <+eshafferart> Ye
[1:52:10] <%Deadpal> no it's amazing.
[1:52:10] <JoveGar> no
[1:52:11] <Inebriateddonut> yeh
[1:52:12] <+eshafferart> it's p good
[1:52:12] <dekkitout> Is the sun hot?
[1:52:13] <+SolverCODO> @IntrepidEye Amprex was considered the best primary for a long time. Currently #7 on tier list
[1:52:14] <+Cybercobra2> @Pozitive_Possum this is one of the best F2P games ever
[1:52:15] <Wan6Saber> yes
[1:52:16] <%Valdorick> Yar
[1:52:18] <IntrepidEye> hell yeah
[1:52:24] <InugamiTheHound> yes
[1:52:26] <phrickshun> This game is nuts and has probably too much content, haha
[1:52:27] <Tennochief> this IS the best f2p game
[1:52:32] <+FrostedZaibatsu> Its good if youre a new player
[1:52:39] <+eshafferart> It's certainly the most filled with value
[1:52:41] <+Midashu> A lot better than most people expect, but not as great as some are led to believe.
[1:52:44] <%AncelDeLambert> if you make it to Neptune and you're having fun, drop ten bucks on plat and buy some pretties
[1:52:44] <ScreamLord> For Space Hats
[1:52:44] <Tennochief> although burnout and bordeom is a risk
[1:52:46] <%arancet> how much pat? HOW MUCH
[1:52:47] <+gucci_sama> i have 5k hours i hate to love it
[1:52:51] <HibikiYamada> for the economy, of course
[1:52:52] <bonzosan> about 400 hrs in, id like to say the game is okay.
[1:52:53] <Twoiis> And then barely spend plat.
[1:52:54] <IntrepidEye> The one game that I'm happy to have tossed hundreds of dollars in to
[1:52:55] <InugamiTheHound> this game puts many $60 AAA games to shame every year
[1:52:56] <Tennochief> especially if you've spent a long time on the game
[1:52:58] <PkSilent01> grinding for relics and the primes are a bitch but yeah this game is a 10/10
[1:53:01] <anon_1307> Go Canada
[1:53:04] <detritus25> You've also exploited people for this game. A true sign of game goodness.
[1:53:05] <Tennochief> content drought is an especially bad time
[1:53:11] <waifoong98> I will give this game one thing is that, it runs way better than Path of Exile. God that game is a pain in the ass to run normally
[1:53:14] <SummonerMagno> Pat alone founded railjack
[1:53:16] <eanscrale> It's the only one that probably deserves, and at some point did need it.
[1:53:21] <alextrebeken> patriotism is only for america
[1:53:22] <ScreamLord> DO you ever buy Prime Access packs?
[1:53:24] <+mrshazboto> I just realized...your inaros doesn't randomly have 9k health....
[1:53:29] <%AncelDeLambert> crushing it is having all four points and never losing one
[1:53:44] <%AncelDeLambert> @ScreamLord too pricey
[1:53:44] <+SolverCODO> Pat's inaros doesnt have status immunity either, which is weird
[1:53:54] <Wan6Saber> nice glow
[1:54:02] <+mrshazboto> Dear Pat - Why is your Inaros' number so small
[1:54:02] <Tennochief> Inaros withut status immunity is fine
[1:54:19] <%AncelDeLambert> status immunity takes a slot
[1:54:21] <detritus25> We need different lighting on the customization ship. Looking flashy in all UVs.
[1:54:31] <phrickshun> @waifoong98 what's wrong with your Path of Exile performance? All I know is the game runs infinitely better when it's on an SSD
[1:54:35] <+SolverCODO> But you got knocked down earlier :O
[1:54:43] <+Fynale> pat why do you look like an anime kid studying for test with that headband on
[1:54:55] <%Valdorick> Inaros - The Beyblade
[1:55:02] <waifoong98> @phrickshun I had problem with it lagging at high loot drops and log in take at least 3 tries
[1:55:14] <%Nymphonomicon> @AngriestPat I'm playing Crossing Fates in the background, take this theme music and be powered up!
[1:55:16] <dekkitout> Inaros in basically a Pillar Man
[1:55:17] <%IncredibleMeh> Wanted to grind shit out while watching the stream, but I'm way to goddamn tired. G'night everybody!
[1:55:21] <mayorrev> read donations while you tank bullets @AngriestPat
[1:55:21] <Giothegame> So is the new melee system in the game now? Been away for a few months
[1:55:24] <mayorrev> LUL
[1:55:28] <+VariantX7> Inaros with negation swarm and adaptation is damn near unkillable
[1:55:29] <%AncelDeLambert> behemoth fucking I HATE IT
[1:55:31] <+gucci_sama> does anyone know if pat has any favorite weapons?
[1:55:41] <%AncelDeLambert> @gucci_sama he's using it
[1:55:42] <waifoong98> @Giothegame not yet, but they did remove quick melee
[1:55:43] <Tennochief> *Laughs in MHW C Transmog mod*
[1:55:43] <phrickshun> @waifoong98 oof, don't know anything about that. Sorry
[1:55:44] <Goldenwolf98> Behemoth is so poorly made I hate it
[1:55:47] <InugamiTheHound> the Canadian dollar looks so cool especially with the new vertical $5! Also I wish america would switch over to $1&$2 dollar coins
[1:55:48] <+Cybercobra2> a hard fight giving good rewards? how dare
[1:55:48] <dekkitout> Behemoth? AT Lunastra and Nergi easilly take the cake
[1:55:59] <+gucci_sama> @AncelDeLambert the zaw gun?
[1:56:02] <Giothegame> Ah ok thanks for the reply @waifoong98
[1:56:05] <Ion_Laser> Clear oot
[1:56:06] <detritus25> He big mad kitty.
[1:56:06] <%GarbageNirvana> Clear them all oot
[1:56:13] <waifoong98> @phrickshun yeah, it is quite annoying, especially as a new player
[1:56:14] <+eshafferart> I thought that was a wierd alien inflection
[1:56:18] <%coreyferrell> @Goodbye_Jojo0 Thanks for the gift sub!
[1:56:21] <detritus25> Clear em out eh.
[1:56:24] <%AncelDeLambert> @gucci_sama everyone loves the catchmoon kitgun, but no, the amprex electric doomgun is his favy right now
[1:56:30] <Goldenwolf98> @dekkitout a bow makes AT Luna a joke bow cant save me from stupid ass behemoth
[1:56:39] <+SolverCODO> It can happen, I've seen it
[1:56:41] <$RubberFistFight> @InugamiTheHound eh, we've got 1 and 2 buck coins in Australia and they get heavy fast if you have more than a few of them.
[1:56:43] <%velemi> pat have you not seen that fanart
[1:56:54] <cinder_chan> what frame is that?
[1:56:55] <BeefyQueefer> Is Pat wearing a do-rag? Funnily enough, looks more black that Woolie does.
[1:56:57] <mayorrev> @AngriestPat i feel like paige and rebecca ford would be best friends
[1:57:02] <%Mekhet09> Inaros prime.
[1:57:02] <+SolverCODO> @cinder_chan inaros
[1:57:03] <Ion_Laser> I hear scream
[1:57:05] <%Valdorick> I think it glitched out with your UI and didn't load your energy color.
[1:57:06] <phrickshun> @waifoong98 all I can say is the game runs less like ass on an SSD and if you're having very long patch times you may want to use the standalone client
[1:57:06] <Goldenwolf98> @AngriestPat they put a new lighting system into the game like a patch ago
[1:57:08] <worldbrand> Could just have been a host/client bug
[1:57:08] <cinder_chan> oh dang
[1:57:11] <detritus25> Different customization lighting when?
[1:57:12] <%Agami23> @AngriestPat nah that ssome fan art. its pretty nuts. elena makes some creepy shit
[1:57:15] <model_gx> JUP
[1:57:17] <+Cybercobra2> time to see that new tileset
[1:57:18] <%AncelDeLambert> they'd totally get along
[1:57:20] <mayorrev> oh wow for real?
[1:57:23] <mayorrev> thats amazing
[1:57:27] <+gucci_sama> @AncelDeLambert oh interesting i havent built the catchmoon yet or used the amprex much since beam weapons got changed
[1:57:35] <deviljhojho94> !uptime
[1:57:35] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 57m.
[1:57:36] <%AncelDeLambert> Ro-pahl-lo-lyst
[1:57:37] <$RubberFistFight> @BeefyQueefer doesn;'t woolie hate those jokes?
[1:57:46] <MasterDecoder> RIP
[1:57:54] <IntrepidEye> Watch about half the Quiet Shy stream. I am astounded and horrified how much you corrupted DE with Jojo
[1:58:02] <+JavaManJoJo> Reb was talking about r/ShitpostCrusaders on Shy's stream today
[1:58:04] <+SolverCODO> ropopopodopolyst
[1:58:11] <InugamiTheHound> @RubberFistFight yeah I remember in Montreal it wasn't too bad. I love the look of $1&$2 dollar coins
[1:58:12] <+troyfitzg> hey pat
[1:58:13] <waifoong98> @phrickshun patch times ain't too bad tbh, but thanks for the tips btw
[1:58:15] <$rdark_ksu> I just showed up. Why Pat more dork looking than normal?
[1:58:22] <+Cybercobra2> check out that revamped tileset, tasty
[1:58:25] <%AncelDeLambert> @gucci_sama catchmoon maxed crit is insano broken, it's complete meta. Amprex needs forma, frankly, and I still have trouble making it handle arbitrations
[1:58:32] <detritus25> When are you going to stream Megaman PSX Pat?
[1:58:32] <Tennochief> damn that place is fine
[1:58:33] <$RubberFistFight> @InugamiTheHound when they're clean they look good but once they're dirtied up they look like trash money from someone's butt.
[1:58:36] <+OceanGovernor> That is the official warframe grinding sweatband
[1:58:40] <%GarbageNirvana> Look for D
[1:58:41] <%Valdorick> Is pat on Public, or Friends only?
[1:58:45] <SephirKath> I too like the D
[1:58:47] <Tennochief> the will of D
[1:58:47] <Scrub_Seeker> just think, ALL of empyrean is gonna look like this
[1:58:50] <InugamiTheHound> initial d?
[1:58:54] <MasterDecoder> @rdark_ksu A fan gave Pat a Warframe Founder headband
[1:59:00] <Tennochief> DEJA VE
[1:59:03] <+gucci_sama> @AncelDeLambert damn i built the other zaw gun and i kinda dont like it LUL
[1:59:03] <Tennochief> VU
[1:59:14] <Fear_Ranjer> God these space ninjas look so hype
[1:59:17] <%Valdorick> Glaxion Vandal
[1:59:18] <KUYAmoPESh> Soma prime still is king
[1:59:19] <+Cybercobra2> corinth becouse its meaty as hell
[1:59:22] <+gucci_sama> i shouldve build the catchmoon
[1:59:26] <waifoong98> Corrinth is amazing
[1:59:28] <+Cynical_Donut> Fulmin is my personal fav primary nowadays
[1:59:28] <Giothegame> You know I feel at some point they are going to put in a skeleton frame
[1:59:29] <Scrub_Seeker> Fulmin is a really good primary
[1:59:30] <+VariantX7> i use phantasma alot myself
[1:59:31] <InugamiTheHound> @RubberFistFight yeah $1 dollar coin in america can look dirty at times. But $1 dollar coin is very easy to use and I wish we could move over to them.
[1:59:33] <ShinyMonger> I like me a good supra vandal myself.
[1:59:36] <worldbrand> It really isn't as good as it used to be
[1:59:39] <GPAlpha> @AngriestPat Don't forget to build the Fulmin (Wisp's gun). It's fucking great
[1:59:40] <%AncelDeLambert> there's so many good primaries, don't make me choose
[1:59:41] <Tennochief> SOma Prime is more like a duke now
[1:59:41] <Thannen924> Soma Prime is Meh
[1:59:42] <Goldenwolf98> @AngriestPat Not big improved once you end up getting caught by 50 traps and all the weird ass platforming sections that always seem to be where the capture targets are LUL
[1:59:45] <Inebriateddonut> CORINTH for life
[1:59:45] <kuningaz45> Corinth is my favorite shotgun, Fulmin's actually amazing
[1:59:47] <%AncelDeLambert> Corinth is the TITS
[1:59:48] <%camodikk> opticor vandal is pretty good
[1:59:48] <+Cybercobra2> soma prime is super fucking MEH atm
[1:59:48] <LeftOverPizza13> arca plasmor is still pretty good
[1:59:49] <%Valdorick> Corinth Prime FUCKING WHEN!?
[1:59:50] <Tennochief> it's not king but it's fine
[1:59:50] <$RubberFistFight> @InugamiTheHound you guys should bring back the silver dollar, that thing was cool.
[1:59:51] <+eshafferart> That fuckin grenade is killer
[1:59:51] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 2 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 8oz (240mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[1:59:52] <%jack_s1n> can any mods here give me the discord invite? twitch messed up
[1:59:52] <IntrepidEye> Soma P got dethroned ages ago
[1:59:52] <phrickshun> I remember when the Soma was the big meta gun back in like 2014
[1:59:52] <MasterDecoder> Supra Vandal > Soma Prime
[1:59:56] <kuningaz45> Ignis Wraith is a bitch
[1:59:56] <worldbrand> Sobek's pretty good with acid shells and because its riven dispo is so high
[1:59:57] <%doc_ock_rokc> Soma is pretty good one SOME bosses
[1:59:58] <%king_wragles> THE CORINTH IS FUCKING DOPE aaa
[2:00:01] <Fear_Ranjer> YO WHAT
[2:00:02] <%Agami23> @AngriestPat hey pat, any chance you can show off your mods for amprex after this?
[2:00:02] <fatalDestiny> I'm enjoying the Rubico Prime for a primary.
[2:00:03] <+SolverCODO> Phantasma, Fulmin, Zenith are the top 3 primaries on the tier list
[2:00:03] <waifoong98> U can use Corinth and throw in the duality on equinox, instantly lazy index mode
[2:00:03] <$rdark_ksu> @MasterDecoder suits him i suppose, now just need some red bull decals and final form is achieved
[2:00:04] <DigbyMayor> Tigris Prime is my baby
[2:00:06] <%Goodbye_Jojo0> hey I use the Corinth with my Inaros!
[2:00:06] <Daigrey> Stugg
[2:00:10] <eanscrale> What's so great about the Corinth I haven't built one yet?
[2:00:12] <Tennochief> how do you build the corinth properly?
[2:00:14] <+gucci_sama> ive been using the fulmin a lot recently
[2:00:17] <%AncelDeLambert> supra vandal is best dakka dakka
[2:00:19] <$RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat so apparently your warframe is Imhotep from the mummy? o_O
[2:00:24] <Tennochief> I keep on trying to use it but it underprerforms for me
[2:00:30] <%AncelDeLambert> corinth is just fun incarnate
[2:00:35] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat it sounds soooo good (the corrinth)
[2:00:35] <kuningaz45> You build the Corinth however the fuck you want
[2:00:48] <dekkitout> Doesn't his Amprex have slash/Hunter's Munitions?
[2:00:48] <+Cybercobra2> @AngriestPat did you know that apearantly they added a lion roar to make the corinth's sound effects?
[2:00:52] <kuningaz45> just status and crit same time doesn't matter because it does BOTH
[2:00:56] <GPAlpha> The Corinth and Astilla are my favorite shotguns
[2:00:59] <waifoong98> not top tier but throwing floating mines with Quanta Vandal is fun
[2:01:00] <IntrepidEye> Corinth airburst to just cheese the shit out of things not even in the room
[2:01:00] <InugamiTheHound> @RubberFistFight that thing was very big and heavy. If we could replace $1 with gold goin and $2 dollar bill with Gold/silver(opposite of toonie) with a cougar on it.
[2:01:01] <artoflec> so like uhhh..what are you fighting against in Warframe anyway
[2:01:10] <%ThatOneGameTester> what about that amprex variant they give out at 100 fractures Pat?
[2:01:12] <%doc_ock_rokc> Pat if you are going to do disruption I suggest Max range Gara and use her "useless" 3
[2:01:15] <Nina96> @artoflec everything
[2:01:17] <televisedrevolting> Hey, how feasible is it to not spend money on this game?
[2:01:19] <kuningaz45> You're fighting against spoilers
[2:01:20] <Scrub_Seeker> @artoflec everything
[2:01:23] <+JavaManJoJo> And the sound the Corinth makes when you shoot it
[2:01:24] <Tennochief> everyone
[2:01:25] <%Valdorick> Corinth is in a wired spot, because its one of the few crit focus shotguns.
[2:01:27] <+SolverCODO> Corinth is 3rd tier
[2:01:31] <artoflec> lobosKek
[2:01:33] <LeftOverPizza13> "space russians" LuL
[2:01:33] <artoflec> cool
[2:01:34] <$RubberFistFight> @InugamiTheHound yeah but... it was COOL. Also solid silver, which makes it double-cool. Silver is better than gold imho.
[2:01:34] <%arkv01> spess KGB
[2:01:35] <Rentixx> Amprenx, AKA that one gun from destroy all humans
[2:01:36] <%AncelDeLambert> nope, NOT the Flood, no way
[2:01:37] <dekkitout> Totally not the Flood
[2:01:37] <waifoong98> LUL
[2:01:46] <+VariantX7> @ThatOneGameTester its glaxion vandal
[2:01:46] <+Cybercobra2> dont forget the sentient biomachines from deep space
[2:01:48] <%Goodbye_Jojo0> don't forgot about the Corrupted pat
[2:01:49] <@absolute_weapon> We called that "Legally Distinct"
[2:01:49] <eanscrale> There's also one more but they
[2:01:51] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat don't forget the spoiler faction that you're also fighting
[2:01:58] <+gucci_sama> i really like the crossbow that was released with garuda it has a euphona alt fire
[2:02:04] <%ThatOneGameTester> oh crap your right
[2:02:05] <+Fynale> is that the lucio gun
[2:02:07] <detritus25> Damn that move looks so ridiculous but I love it.
[2:02:16] <ShinyMonger> Vectis Prime is another nice primary for when something REALLY needs to die.
[2:02:18] <+JavaManJoJo> @AngriestPat Did you notice in the new intro cutscene the Grineer are noticeably less crusty because it took place so long ago? Even their armor looks nicer
[2:02:23] <%Valdorick> Ah yes, "The Sentients"; We have found no validity to such a claim.
[2:02:23] <%AncelDeLambert> and then you aim for the head and it'll kill things HARDER
[2:02:23] <InugamiTheHound> @RubberFistFight we tried with susan dollar coins and everyone hated it because it was silver and same size as a quarter.
[2:02:26] <kuningaz45> Try a rattleguts it is actually badass
[2:02:26] <phrickshun> wow, that really is a Lucio gun isn't it
[2:02:31] <OldOnyx> The flood totally aren't the Vang
[2:02:39] <+VariantX7> i put pax seeker on mine and it pretty much kills everything
[2:02:40] <BlueLunecy> I love my rattleguts
[2:02:43] <kuningaz45> I have a rattleguts and it's my second favorite after Lex Prime
[2:02:51] <%AncelDeLambert> my rattle isn't what I wanted it to be, used a potato QQ
[2:02:52] <RaimeTT> Rubico Prime is so nice to handle
[2:02:52] <$RubberFistFight> @InugamiTheHound quarters are cool too. I had one somewhere but I lost it. [Laments in Australian]
[2:02:59] <+gucci_sama> i might need to build all the kitguns LUL
[2:03:01] <%Valdorick> Harrow has good poses
[2:03:03] <IntrepidEye> Been using Tiberon Prime a lot lately. Changing fire rate is pretty fun and useful
[2:03:04] <LeftOverPizza13> max fire rate rattleguts
[2:03:08] <%Valdorick> Gun Priest best Priest
[2:03:08] <%sshen> I have a rattleguts riven
[2:03:11] <+Cybercobra2> i have a max firerate rattleguts LUL
[2:03:12] <%AncelDeLambert> @AngriestPat slow fire rattle or fast fire?
[2:03:13] <%doc_ock_rokc> I did a rattleguts Gibber Splat and while its not meta its great for stripping armor
[2:03:25] <Inebriateddonut> Is it just me or do most Zaws and Kitguns look terrible?
[2:03:34] <InugamiTheHound> @RubberFistFight yeah I like quarters and make sure I have some of them because I don't correct change all the time. I hate pennies so much
[2:03:42] <Zombrocom> The Fulmin is pretty much my new favourite gun
[2:03:42] <kuningaz45> Did you ever build yourself a Plague Kripath rapier? now THAT is probably my favorite melee weapon right now. Too bad I never use it LUL
[2:03:51] <%AncelDeLambert> most of the zaws look like shit, yeah
[2:03:53] <RaimeTT> @IntrepidEye you have a Soma prime?
[2:03:57] <rosemon5001> you space lucio now?
[2:03:59] <%AncelDeLambert> at least the katana zaw looks okay-ish
[2:04:01] <%Deadpal> modular primareis are coming .
[2:04:03] <Zombrocom> It's like a catchmoon that can hotswap to a machine gun
[2:04:06] <spacecatstreams> benno
[2:04:12] <%ThatOneGameTester> oooooh that would be kick ass
[2:04:13] <%doc_ock_rokc> we are getting tenno styled archwings
[2:04:16] <Inebriateddonut> We are getting modular Archwing though
[2:04:18] <%AncelDeLambert> I just want a whip zaw and a scattershot kitgun
[2:04:18] <$RubberFistFight> @InugamiTheHound Australia got rid of 1 and 2c coins for exactly that reason, they were worth basically nothing and were becoming a problem for circulation.
[2:04:24] <+TheWorstChance> why cant we put skins on zaws?
[2:04:24] <%Deadpal> yes
[2:04:26] <worldbrand> Better modular parts would be nice too, I was hoping for corpus bits for zaws
[2:04:26] <%doc_ock_rokc> no
[2:04:29] <%vectorless_peon> infested primaries are wht i want
[2:04:30] <+Cybercobra2> tossup between tenno and corpus guns for best looking for me
[2:04:31] <Zombrocom> For like 7 months, but yeah
[2:04:35] <+SolverCODO> They talked about modular archwing
[2:04:35] <detritus25> Big tornado energy
[2:04:36] <%AncelDeLambert> they talked about modular ARCHWINGS, but I haven't heard of primaries
[2:04:36] <%Deadpal> no date
[2:04:37] <+OceanGovernor> Archwing is next
[2:04:37] <+Golinvoxx> modular arcwings
[2:04:39] <Zombrocom> Soon TM
[2:04:39] <%Deadpal> so probably next open world.
[2:04:41] <%Goodbye_Jojo0> no, it was modular archwings
[2:04:41] <Thannen924> They talked about modular archwing
[2:04:44] <Inebriateddonut> did not hear anything about primaries but saw some modular archwings at tennocon
[2:04:45] <worldbrand> @TheWorstChance Short answer they said they were looking into it and probably forgot
[2:04:47] <Thannen924> for Empyrean
[2:04:48] <anon_1307> duviri
[2:04:51] <MakeshiftSurgeon> @AngriestPat Speaking of weapon models, which primaries do you like the look of the most?
[2:04:57] <IntrepidEye> @RaimeTT Yep. Set the Soma P aside when I built the Tiberon Prime and Supra Vandal
[2:04:59] <%sshen> Just got blazing step from round 8 ESO
[2:05:01] <%Deadpal> well all archwings are getting blink so yeah they will
[2:05:08] <InugamiTheHound> @RubberFistFight yeah it cost 1.5 cents to make a penny but americans are so dumb they won't get rid of it. Same with useless $1&$2 dollar bills with dollar coins
[2:05:08] <+Fynale> they need modular arcwings for railjack
[2:05:08] <%camodikk> i really just want the archwings shit to be way easier to level
[2:05:19] <worldbrand> @TheWorstChance Long answer, for some stupid reason the stats are tied to the parts
[2:05:24] <Nina96> @AngriestPat thoughts on wisp?
[2:05:28] <%velemi> Yeah but you already have that its the catchmoon
[2:05:31] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat would you rather they make all guns modular?
[2:05:36] <worldbrand> And by parts i mean the mesh
[2:05:36] <%bluetocho13> bluetocho13 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 30 months, currently on a 30 month streak! 
[2:05:37] <%Valdorick> It will go two ways - they all suck and are worthless; they're too good and every new prime primary becomes worthless
[2:05:37] <OldOnyx> modular weapons aren't as big on gimmicks but overall, yeah
[2:05:50] <kuningaz45> Archwings are the worst to level. My Itzal is STILL at level 11 and I've had it for 2 months
[2:05:52] <mayorrev> @AngriestPat should i try to get that new opticor
[2:05:55] <+gucci_sama> thats pretty fair
[2:06:02] <+TheWorstChance> oh ok thank you @worldbrand its just that the zaws are so damn ugly lmao
[2:06:06] <ShinyMonger> Found out recently that Synth Fiber on your sentinel lets you pick up health orbs regardless of your health level, making Equilibrium much more useful. Slapped that on my Nezha and it's doing wonders.
[2:06:15] <%cybermooseblue> Pat seems to like the shiny metallic stuff
[2:06:20] <waifoong98> modular weapons, then thew showed modular archwank, how does this even works
[2:06:21] <%Valdorick> @kuningaz45 Use its stealth and snipe bitches in Open World
[2:06:22] <$RubberFistFight> @InugamiTheHound how is that not a massive drain on the government's budget though? If they're making coins at a cost of 150% of what they're worth, that's gonna add up real fucking fast.
[2:06:23] <+Cybercobra2> arca plasmor would be #1 for me if it's material was shiny metal
[2:06:25] <%doc_ock_rokc> its not completely shit but its not super meta breaking
[2:06:37] <detritus25> So should I even ask how much cash you have thrown at this game?
[2:06:37] <LeftOverPizza13> how to get an opticor vandal: use the regular opticor and only half charge it
[2:06:38] <IntrepidEye> Its pretty good. Not great but good
[2:06:41] <%JJCheeker> Hello everybody apatDab apatDab apatDab
[2:06:55] <RaimeTT> @IntrepidEye did you try putting a +fire-rate on it? it's just fun to see it with your own eyes although the supra vandal would give you a similar effect LUL
[2:06:58] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> What have I missed
[2:07:08] <%doc_ock_rokc> OV with Harrow 2 + fire rate = destruction
[2:07:09] <Pepebotellaw> stream fucked up the frist 5 minutes
[2:07:10] <MasterDecoder> @detritus25 At least $100, but....
[2:07:13] <phrickshun> I have a soft spot for explosives and double barrels. How are my bois the Tigris and Tonkor doing nowadays
[2:07:20] <+kidcoheed> it's my first Stream here in the Leprechaun Zone and my first time seeing anything Warframe but it looks cool
[2:07:21] <InugamiTheHound> @RubberFistFight americans think the penny is useful and they think $1&$2 dollar coins is too heavy or make it hard to tip strippers. But Canada,The UK and the euro work fine.
[2:07:22] <%JJCheeker> AW it's the baby sipsipElmo
[2:07:35] <+SolverCODO> "crit forever" lol
[2:07:42] <%Valdorick> Pyana, -recoil riven, Arcane Velocity, Harrow's 2 = map melted
[2:07:43] <+gucci_sama> ohhh
[2:07:44] <kuningaz45> so which warframe did you bounce off of when you played it?
[2:08:00] <Daigrey> synoid simulor
[2:08:02] <detritus25> 100 isn't the worst I heard. But we need to see them receipts.
[2:08:02] <%JJCheeker> I like that armor it looks very nice
[2:08:10] <burgerdicks> I just started Warframe, I just unlocked Mars and landed in Fortuna. Do I just keep going through to unlock all locations? Or what?
[2:08:15] <+gucci_sama> such nice colors
[2:08:19] <+axebird> Blast DansGame
[2:08:19] <%JJCheeker> It looks very purple
[2:08:30] <%JJCheeker> Kinda
[2:08:30] <%Deadpal> blast is a good proc for status on condition overload
[2:08:32] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat what did reordering the mods do?
[2:08:32] <GobblesInTheMist> Can someone from the chat tell me what Pats mains are, because i know somone has already asked im sure .
[2:08:33] <%Deadpal> it counts as 2 procs at once
[2:08:38] <%doc_ock_rokc> @burgerdicks fortuna is later game keep going on the star chart
[2:08:40] <%Deadpal> plus blast does more damage vs robotic health
[2:08:40] <%Valdorick> @burgerdicks The open worlds are traps, just keep going through starchart.
[2:08:44] <%FrostMass22> @burgerdicks Just fill out the star chart
[2:08:48] <+mikesniderman> hory shet
[2:08:59] <+mikesniderman> I caught yer strem
[2:09:05] <%cybermooseblue> cybermooseblue subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months, currently on a 8 month streak! 
[2:09:08] <+gucci_sama> ORA ORA ORA
[2:09:12] <%FrostMass22> @burgerdicks After a while you'll be able to do quests and the game snowballs from there
[2:09:18] <$RubberFistFight> @InugamiTheHound well they're not wrong about the weight, like I said before if you use cash frequently you wind up with a lot of shrapnel. As for tipping strippers, I also agree that they probably wouldn't appreciate coins being flung at them. Personally I wonder why the states don't adopt differently-coloured notes for the various values - they're all green, how do you tell the difference at a glance?
[2:09:22] <%arkv01> apatWink ty dan
[2:09:37] <%Panther2103> I haven't
[2:09:40] <cheezbass> me
[2:09:40] <burgerdicks> Me :)
[2:09:41] <+axebird> @Deadpal Gas also inflicts two status effects, but does it in a larger area and without knocking everything down and making it harder to hit
[2:09:41] <%Agami23> i haven't
[2:09:41] <$LuchaDePucha> me
[2:09:42] <worldbrand> hahaha
[2:09:42] <mayorrev> DO IT
[2:09:43] <%AncelDeLambert> BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRTt!
[2:09:44] <%frankthetank285> me
[2:09:45] <$RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat never heard of it
[2:09:45] <+Gr33nCutl4ss> its soo good
[2:09:46] <sentientvin> me
[2:09:46] <+gucci_sama> me Kappa
[2:09:46] <SephirKath> Never heard of it

[2:10:50] <TurtlesAndTentacles> WHAT THE FUCK
[2:10:50] <televisedrevolting> Reminds me of thebRighteo
[2:10:50] <%Deadpal> this is the supra vanadal.
[2:10:51] <%Agami23> HOW MUCH AMMO?!
[2:10:52] <eanscrale> I just got this gun, is it worth it?
[2:10:52] <%Deadpal> it's a good gun.
[2:10:52] <%Panther2103> Holy shit.
[2:10:54] <13sin> NEEDS MORE DAKKA
[2:10:54] <+SaltySombrero> let's see that reload speed
[2:10:54] <+theAncopro> MUDA
[2:10:55] <KahunaTuna> Thats a good Grakatta
[2:10:56] <%AncelDeLambert> how the FUCK does he have that big a clip?
[2:10:57] <GreatJumps> Kreygasm
[2:10:57] <%kiiiirsten> Never back down never surrender never reload
[2:10:58] <chambatron> 1600 ammo
[2:10:59] <%arkv01> new gun WHODIS
[2:10:59] <worldbrand> 300 boolet
[2:10:59] <GobblesInTheMist> Wtf explain
[2:11:01] <%doc_ock_rokc> 300 shots
[2:11:01] <LeftOverPizza13> does that have shred on it or not
[2:11:01] <+Darren716> LUL
[2:11:01] <Batty_Bane> 1600!!!!!????
[2:11:01] <$rdark_ksu> ha
[2:11:02] <Manwad> the no recoil kills me
[2:11:02] <%Deadpal> and less than 2 seconds to reload!
[2:11:02] <dekkitout> It's even more WILD with a riven
[2:11:02] <phrickshun> Now that's A LOTTA BULLETS
[2:11:05] <televisedrevolting> Reminds me of the Righteous Anarchy.
[2:11:08] <SephirKath> Never enough DAKKA
[2:11:10] <%AncelDeLambert> hell of a primed mod, man
[2:11:10] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat put.... put extended mag on it
[2:11:15] <SummonerMagno> and somehow its not enough
[2:11:18] <blackorchidKI2> It costs 400,000 credits to fire this weapon...
[2:11:19] <Batty_Bane> okay 300 at once but lordy
[2:11:19] <Pepebotellaw> 12 bullets per second_
[2:11:20] <Rentixx> ORAORAORA the gun
[2:11:21] <$LuchaDePucha> oh is it now
[2:11:23] <%kiiiirsten> @king_wragles You crazy bastard
[2:11:25] <Pepebotellaw> question mark
[2:11:25] <%JJCheeker> Is it the best though
[2:11:26] <worldbrand> i should emphasize that 300 is the BASE magazine size
[2:11:27] <InugamiTheHound> @RubberFistFight tipping stippers was easy on montreal the coins and bills were picked up after the show. Also we need to change colors of our currency. Dollar coins also help blind americans
[2:11:29] <%Deadpal> also when it procs it gives you 25% energy back!
[2:11:30] <socratetris> I got the Supra Vandal at Pat's suggestion. It is fun to use, but I love Ignis
[2:11:32] <+kidcoheed> so it's just a beam of bullets?
[2:11:35] <SoySocks> that's 12 per second
[2:11:36] <%doc_ock_rokc> Soma prime fires faster
[2:11:38] <+gucci_sama> aint nobody surviving that shit
[2:11:41] <%AncelDeLambert> fuck, mine still needs work to do that
[2:11:42] <$RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat Somewhere there is an Ork that is insanely turned on and he doesn't know why LUL
[2:11:42] <%Deadpal> it's bullets not beams thank god
[2:11:49] <ShinyMonger> And it gives energy with a mod
[2:11:51] <$philoboy123> It'd be better if you were using a mouse SwiftRage
[2:11:58] <Inebriateddonut> Wait what's an "intriguing datum"?
[2:12:01] <socratetris> No about Speed with Supra, it is about duration
[2:12:01] <%king_wragles> @kiiiirsten listen, if you ever see me trying to get a Primed Extended Mag.... you know what I'm up to
[2:12:06] <Pepebotellaw> real yakuza use gamepad
[2:12:06] <%doc_ock_rokc> @RubberFistFight you lie he knows EXACTLY why
[2:12:14] <dekkitout> I forgot about the augment
[2:12:18] <Nina96> big miss
[2:12:19] <%AncelDeLambert> yeah, not hitscan
[2:12:23] <MasterDecoder> @Inebriateddonut Faction statue that can be traded for rep
[2:12:30] <%doc_ock_rokc> Not enough daka
[2:12:35] <dekkitout> Or give it to Mag/Mirage
[2:12:41] <Inebriateddonut> @MasterDecoder huh, is that new?
[2:12:45] <LeftOverPizza13> @AngriestPat a gun that shoots bullets? say it aint so!!!!!!!!
[2:12:45] <MasterDecoder> Nope
[2:12:45] <televisedrevolting> @doc_ock_rokc Never enough Dakka.
[2:12:47] <kuningaz45> no
[2:12:49] <%doc_ock_rokc> @dekkitout give it to Harrow
[2:12:50] <Nina96> can u show your mods for it later?
[2:12:54] <+gucci_sama> failed to reach grakata levels of daka
[2:13:05] <Pepebotellaw> what about that bullet that shoots guns
[2:13:14] <$RubberFistFight> @InugamiTheHound here we have plastic money like the Canucks. $5 is a pretty pinkish colour, $10 is blue, $20 is a red-orange, $50 is yellow and $100 is green.
[2:13:17] <Inebriateddonut> ohhh right it's specific to suda
[2:13:27] <dekkitout> I did a spit take from that Harrow comment
[2:13:34] <%AncelDeLambert> SIX?
[2:13:35] <televisedrevolting> @pepebotellaw That's a thing in Enter the Gungeon.
[2:13:38] <burgerdicks> I knew Pat was secretly into M Prex
[2:13:42] <Crankthulhu> @Pepebotellaw I guarantee that exists in Enter the Gungeon
[2:13:43] <%AncelDeLambert> no wonder mine's still not good enough
[2:13:46] <+SolverCODO> Amprex is totally worth 6
[2:13:53] <%doc_ock_rokc> @dekkitout Volt+Wisp+Harrow+mods
[2:13:53] <talisign> Find the D
[2:14:02] <%AncelDeLambert> mine's only 4 LUL
[2:14:12] <NoirePanzer> But who Tenno if Tenno is you
[2:14:20] <$RubberFistFight> @NoirePanzer Baba, clearly
[2:14:32] <%Deadpal> god. a wisp and harrow buffing a supras fire rate
[2:14:35] <Pepebotellaw> so warframe is enter the gungeon in 3rd person perspective
[2:14:35] <InugamiTheHound> @RubberFistFight pretty much like in Canada/Montreal. That money looks cool and won't rip apart. US dollar bills especially $1 note only last 1-2 years while a dollar coin can last 20+ years
[2:14:36] <+SolverCODO> rip
[2:14:39] <%Deadpal> yes
[2:14:43] <waifoong98> LUL
[2:14:49] <talisign> @RubberFistFight But if Tenno...
[2:14:49] <SummonerMagno> protect dem digsites
[2:14:50] <+kira2993> did Pat already use his umbral forma?
[2:14:52] <MasterDecoder> BIG shoots
[2:14:53] <Tennochief> ah SUpra Vandal, the best minigun in the game
[2:15:14] <%cybermooseblue> There’s also a gun that shoots lukewarm Redbull. Pat Balls Prime
[2:15:14] <Inebriateddonut> The way supra shoots makes it feel like it should be an archgun
[2:15:17] <bear_breaker20> damn hes good
[2:15:20] <+Cybercobra2> @Tennochief well... not really. that title nowdays goes to imperator vandal
[2:15:22] <%AncelDeLambert> I have now potatoed my Corinth, thanks chat
[2:15:24] <%Valdorick> I mean, come on guys, there's a point in your fire rate where you just can't control the recoil anymore.
[2:15:24] <Tennochief> thank god it's not one
[2:15:26] <%AncelDeLambert> gonna go big boom boom
[2:15:28] <ShinyMonger> A friend of mine who has been playing warframe since it started only recently found out that the weapons that baro sells are not just skins, but actual different weapons.
[2:15:32] <+Cybercobra2> @AngriestPat ey pat you got your grounded archguns yet?
[2:15:48] <%AncelDeLambert> @ShinyMonger and BETTER weapons, at that
[2:15:55] <+Cybercobra2> damn
[2:15:56] <%AncelDeLambert> profit taker is an ASSHOLE
[2:15:58] <Tennochief> same
[2:16:00] <%TheWinged7> only 2 battery guys can be spawned at once, they must be elsewhere
[2:16:00] <+SolverCODO> wow pat you're really behind huh
[2:16:01] <worldbrand> I like the profit-taker fight but I'm pretty sure I'm alone in that
[2:16:02] <%AncelDeLambert> FUCK Profit Taker!
[2:16:06] <SoySocks> the last i've seen of warframe at all was a friend that played it a lot back in 2015
[2:16:11] <jestrfestr> did you ever fight the new jupiter boss?
[2:16:13] <+uncyderf> dont need to fight profit taker, just do the missions leading up to it
[2:16:14] <+xRyansito> i LOVE profit taker but definitely only on a few frames
[2:16:15] <Thannen924> Profit Taker is a pain in the ass, Exploiter is Great
[2:16:17] <+SolverCODO> Profit taker does suck though yes. It used to be a lot worse
[2:16:19] <%Valdorick> Did Nightwave last season - Didn't do a single one of the 3 "Kill profit taker"
[2:16:19] <%Darthwaffler> Darthwaffler subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 3 month streak! Pat, should I keep giving you money? If yes, OK. If no, too bad you can't stop me! PS: I love my Wisp reservoir build.
[2:16:23] <%Valdorick> … I don't blame him, really.
[2:16:28] <Pepebotellaw> short school bus hype
[2:16:30] <%AncelDeLambert> I need to kill so many more eidolons in order to be ready for PT
[2:16:31] <$RubberFistFight> @InugamiTheHound the very first run of plastic money we did after switching from paper was a fucking trainwreck, it would fall apart if you looked at it the wrong way, the notes were flimsy as shit, they used the wrong plastic or something. It's way better now though.
[2:16:34] <Zombrocom> Profit taker is pretty easy once you have the set up
[2:16:40] <Crankthulhu> Where the hell is the rest of Pat's squad?
[2:16:52] <+SolverCODO> I was wondering the same
[2:16:55] <+gucci_sama> pocket sand ftw
[2:16:56] <Zombrocom> Then it's a quick -5 minute speedrun
[2:16:59] <AsterBodhran> triggering all the other excavators apparently
[2:17:04] <Crankthulhu> Why is Pat the only one doing the mission? LUL
[2:17:04] <%TheWinged7> at F and A
[2:17:05] <Zombrocom> Exploiter is a better fight though
[2:17:08] <%doc_ock_rokc> they are getting datum
[2:17:10] <talisign> @Crankthulhu They are choosing to do excavations in the weirdest way possible
[2:17:17] <+SolverCODO> pro strats: trigger every site, let them all die
[2:17:22] <%Valdorick> Well, since you have 3 extractors up, and one person with you - I can guess
[2:17:26] <mohopsoul> ayo pat what the Fuck is the duvuri paradox
[2:17:30] <+Cybercobra2> now here is the real question: @AngriestPat have you bought a space roomba yet
[2:17:33] <$RubberFistFight> wait, did you say "looking for the datums"?
[2:17:34] <AsterBodhran> Ooh, Genius datum, get dat shiet
[2:17:34] <%doc_ock_rokc> E is done
[2:17:35] <InugamiTheHound> @RubberFistFight yeah I just wish America would make the switch to dollar coins it would save money and create new mining jobs that America needs
[2:17:35] <Pepebotellaw> I'd be scared of ninja pat
[2:17:36] <Tennochief> cowboy time is what it is
[2:17:43] <$RubberFistFight> coz "datums" is singular, the plural is "data" :P
[2:17:48] <MasterDecoder> @mohopsoul No one but DE knows, otherwise, a Paradox
[2:18:14] <Crankthulhu> The Syndicate tokens are so awful and not worth it, just slap a sigil on your frame's back and even tually youll hit max standing, and the basic reward of doing Syndicate missions are more than scraping a bunch of space dubloons
[2:18:22] <$RubberFistFight> @InugamiTheHound oooh man, talkin to an Aussie about mining jobs. You're lucky I'm not one of the types who immediately flies into a rage when mining gets mentioned :P
[2:18:34] <RaimeTT> I swear Inaros jumping and climbing is bugged somehow
[2:18:35] <Tennochief> Sydicate tokens to me are more like emergency funds
[2:18:41] <+SolverCODO> In all my 1500 hours of play I've never actually done a syndicate mission before this week for the challenge
[2:18:50] <Pepebotellaw> any% WR
[2:19:01] <televisedrevolting> @rubberfistfight Australians can fly?
[2:19:06] <%Valdorick> @Crankthulhu But but… they ignore daily cap, and let you micromanage 4 syndicates and... HAHAHA I'm just kidding, yeah, fuck going into pubs and finding the tokens
[2:19:12] <Daigrey> you try out Wukong yet?
[2:19:13] <Crankthulhu> They are great if you really want to power level a Syndicate, get 3000~ rep each
[2:19:19] <waifoong98> I would rather sit in def and survival
[2:19:20] <%doc_ock_rokc> man yesterday I was a harrow and we had a wisp with full strenght and I emptyed my rattleguts gibber completly dry
[2:19:29] <%goose_attack_almanac> Halts the flow of Big Brain Energy
[2:19:30] <Inebriateddonut> @AngriestPat since you haven't done Profit taker have you done exploiter yet?
[2:19:34] <InugamiTheHound> @RubberFistFight yeah mining is okay here in america. Its fracking that pisses off a lot folks because of increase of earthquakes
[2:19:37] <$RubberFistFight> @televisedrevolting yeah, coz we're upside down, y'see. We have to tie ourselves to the ground to arrest our levitation downwards.
[2:19:37] <ShinyMonger> That'll show him
[2:19:39] <Tennochief> God I love harrow
[2:19:40] <Daxalog> That could be a circulation problem
[2:19:47] <Crankthulhu> @Valdorick Syndicate cap is valid, its just you can generate it so passively that "eh"
[2:19:51] <Tennochief> Harrow = SUpra Vandal is a fucking war crime
[2:19:53] <anon_1307> MR 21 lol
[2:19:55] <tangoragahn> Gun twirlers keep twirling
[2:20:12] <%doc_ock_rokc> wha
[2:20:16] <$El_Desperad0> w h a t
[2:20:21] <MasterDecoder> WHY?! GROSS
[2:20:21] <mayorrev> what a dumbass
[2:20:21] <Tennochief> dumbass
[2:20:21] <%foreverN2dust> NotLikeThis
[2:20:22] <+Cybercobra2> LUL
[2:20:23] <dekkitout> Folks who so that befuddle me
[2:20:24] <Crankthulhu> Some people do that with FFXIV
[2:20:24] <%velemi> ACTUALLY INSANE
[2:20:25] <+JavaManJoJo> That's VERY stupid
[2:20:25] <televisedrevolting> @rubberfistfight Man someone needs to rebalance Australia.
[2:20:26] <waifoong98> LUL
[2:20:26] <%doc_ock_rokc> -_-
[2:20:31] <$RubberFistFight> @InugamiTheHound honestly imo it's okay here as well, some people just don't like the deals the government makes with mining companies. But reallly, the bottom line is there's stuff in the ground that we need, and it's not going to dig itself out.
[2:20:31] <%Darthwaffler> Pat, put an ammo drum on your Supra!
[2:20:32] <+Namboto> octoWack
[2:20:32] <Crankthulhu> Also ARR story does in fact, suck balls
[2:20:39] <+SolverCODO> I can understand skipping some dialogue pre-ultima weapon but cutscenes? oof
[2:20:40] <theshillman> how do you become that person?
[2:20:40] <Tennochief> "Why are you lime this"
[2:20:42] <AsterBodhran> "This steak is terrible" he said, eating a raw slab of beef
[2:20:47] <$RubberFistFight> @televisedrevolting nah she'll be right mate :P
[2:20:48] <%sshen> Was he wrong about the 2.x story?
[2:20:50] <+JavaManJoJo> Skipping it, by itself. Sure fine whatever. But just shut up about it, you can't have an opinion about it.
[2:20:54] <fatalDestiny> For memes,
[2:20:54] <burgerdicks> Starting the story in HS is like starting breaking bad on season 4
[2:20:54] <+gucci_sama> the story i skipped wasnt impressive Kappa
[2:20:55] <Nina96> everything before heavensward was kinda boring to me
[2:20:55] <Crankthulhu> HW and pre-patch were a huge jump in quality
[2:20:55] <+Golinvoxx> i mean its a safe bet since its FF game they are all bad
[2:20:56] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat put PRIMED ammo drum on the Supra!
[2:21:02] <Tennochief> Pat do Harrow and SUpra Vandal, it's so fucking evil
[2:21:11] <%Valdorick> ARR's story in a nutshell - PrAy ReTuRn To ThE wAkInG sAnDs.
[2:21:11] <burgerdicks> HW**
[2:21:11] <%Agami23> @AngriestPat thank you.
[2:21:13] <Pepebotellaw> whats Point Strike
[2:21:16] <%Darthwaffler> More bullets is why!
[2:21:18] <lochskye> Are you playing on a ps4? or PC with ps4 controller?
[2:21:26] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat so i got curios about the canon deaths in kotor and apperently light side revan is canon but he goes grey after kotor 1
[2:21:26] <%doc_ock_rokc> Have you done disruption?
[2:21:28] <$RubberFistFight> @lochskye the latter, so the chat told me earlier.
[2:21:30] <phrickshun> that sounds suspiciously too much like MPreg
[2:21:32] <%Gogogolem> The only use for prime shred.
[2:21:32] <worldbrand> Punch through also means it chains off of every target you hit with the main beam, IIRC
[2:21:49] <voltage996> @crankthulhu I just got done with ARR not too long ago, you’re right, but around 2.5 it’s getting so much better
[2:21:50] <Crankthulhu> Disruption is actually super fun with a beefy Mesa and her 4
[2:21:54] <+Cybercobra2> donation ignored FeelsBadMan
[2:21:57] <tangoragahn> Canon Revan is the dullest
[2:22:00] <+axebird> Macroing bullet jumps and/or slide attacks to a single button helps a lot with hand strain
[2:22:00] <Tennochief> so that's what punch through actually does
[2:22:03] <$RubberFistFight> @Fynale most people go grey when they get older Kappa
[2:22:10] <Crankthulhu> PogChamp
[2:22:10] <Tennochief> oh?
[2:22:11] <InugamiTheHound> @RubberFistFight congress has to pass a bill that makes the transition from paper notes to dollar coins. We can save billions of dollars
[2:22:13] <+Cybercobra2> oh hes still catching up, nvm

[2:22:27] <Tennochief> PAT YOU FOOL
[2:22:28] <%arancet> woolie doesnt have enough re2 left for much of a stream
[2:22:29] <GreatJumps> Its been 86 years
[2:22:33] <waifoong98> holyshit
[2:22:34] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat he starts at 8 too right?
[2:22:36] <+Darren716> Has woolie confirmed hes not doing Claire?
[2:22:36] <Crankthulhu> Where the hell are they even in the RE2 story?!?
[2:22:38] <+gucci_sama> PepeLaugh
[2:22:38] <%Darthwaffler> Chewie and Fuckface stream yeah!
[2:22:43] <Nina96> well Leon A
[2:22:44] <TheCoolerbluefooddye> Snailrun world record PogChamp
[2:22:46] <$RubberFistFight> @InugamiTheHound push them to do it. I don't know how the system works over there, but (as much as this is a cliche) it starts with one person.
[2:22:48] <r_Foeburden87> gah they canno use lightning hair either
[2:22:50] <breakerdsx> That Seth Rogan laugh
[2:22:55] <Thannen924> when was the last RE2 stream ?
[2:23:02] <Thannen924> can't remember
[2:23:04] <%doc_ock_rokc> true
[2:23:07] <godzookylives> So all Pat's fault?
[2:23:23] <InugamiTheHound> @RubberFistFight yeah I'll do that. I should see if my congressman is in.
[2:23:28] <+SolverCODO> it's gonna be painfully seeing woolie back at square one
[2:23:33] <burgerdicks> RE2 would have been done already if Woolie weren't just figuring it out :)
[2:23:40] <+Darren716> Is he only going to do Leon?
[2:23:44] <waifoong98> @burgerdicks LUL
[2:23:47] <%doc_ock_rokc> Vald got in!!
[2:23:51] <$RubberFistFight> @InugamiTheHound I guess the trick is finding a way to make the change appealing to the general public. Find the benefit they respond best to and push it on that platform. Whether it be more money available for military spending, or helping the homeless, or whatever.
[2:23:57] <%doc_ock_rokc> LEON!
[2:24:05] <+SolverCODO> HEEEEELP!!
[2:24:09] <+gucci_sama> which frames does pat like to play?

[2:24:17] <%AncelDeLambert> Gara fucking OWNS
[2:24:22] <+SolverCODO> Help me Leon!
[2:24:23] <InugamiTheHound> @RubberFistFight yup that is true
[2:24:25] <%doc_ock_rokc> Leon needs to continue to redfield bloodline
[2:24:29] <AsterBodhran> Why isn't he sprinting..?
[2:24:36] <%AncelDeLambert> oh no, not the MAG
[2:24:39] <$RubberFistFight> @InugamiTheHound lol if you get ahold of your congressdude you should say "I'm talking to an Aussie, he says 'just do it, it's fine'."
[2:24:39] <televisedrevolting> Hey chat what's your favorite legendary/rare weapon in video games?
[2:24:41] <%Deadpal> mag hatred is overblown
[2:24:44] <Thannen924> LEON ! My sister is ovulating right now !
[2:24:47] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat Mag+Penta
[2:24:51] <Twoiis> deluxe mag is PRETTY
[2:24:53] <fatalDestiny> Mag is kinda fun with the Supra Vandal + punch through, but yeah,
[2:24:54] <Nina96> That bubble is amazing though
[2:24:54] <Inebriateddonut> Have you sent any mags to Shy?
[2:24:56] <AsterBodhran> There he do it
[2:24:56] <LeftOverPizza13> mag is good but keep up the mag hate so they don't nerf her
[2:24:57] <worldbrand> Mag's alright then she sucks for a bit and then she becomes incredible with the right setup in lategame
[2:24:58] <Crankthulhu> @televisedrevolting Fierce Deity Mask
[2:25:00] <waifoong98> Mag is good nukinh low level corpus lol
[2:25:02] <waifoong98> *nuking
[2:25:04] <tangoragahn> Mag's great, she's just complex
[2:25:05] <GobblesInTheMist> @AngriestPat correct me if I'm wrong your mains are Equinox, Saryn annndd...
[2:25:05] <$RubberFistFight> @Thannen924 gotta help extend the redfield line!
[2:25:09] <dekkitout> Mag and Limbo deserve 0 hate
[2:25:09] <+SolverCODO> punch dad is here
[2:25:18] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Mag + Penta is the most damaging thing I am aware of
[2:25:27] <waifoong98> I usually run Mag on Io fissure
[2:25:36] <$RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat Purple or Blue Inaros though? Kappa
[2:25:41] <+earthboy2k> h-he's fast
[2:25:44] <Crankthulhu> Mag sucks because Shield HP in this game is broken but DE are too busy shoveling content they're gonna abandon after a half year to fix it

[2:26:36] <+Fynale> that feels way too fast
[2:26:37] <Inebriateddonut> Those things buff your health, speed, and give you lightning procs
[2:26:37] <+axebird> Wisp buffs HP+Regen, Attack+Move speed, and grants a shock aura
[2:26:38] <+gucci_sama> wisp is so cool
[2:26:39] <custoadian> Wisp is super good
[2:26:42] <+Golinvoxx> and attack speed

[2:27:03] <%doc_ock_rokc> @BestTeaMaker The party never ends
[2:27:04] <$RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat is that the Zapping System? Kappa
[2:27:08] <Crankthulhu> @BestTeaMaker You dont even need Octavia, Wisp is that busted
[2:27:08] <Tennochief> you get used to it @RubberFistFight
[2:27:08] <%AncelDeLambert> I just wish Wisp opened people to finishers, it's what I wanted from her and I didn't get it
[2:27:09] <Thannen924> Wisp is actually one of the best buffs frames now ans also have one of the coolest ultimate
[2:27:09] <waifoong98> booooo
[2:27:16] <%Darthwaffler> Did Pat not read what Wisp does?
[2:27:20] <gunzerkingdunce> And they give you more time between bounty refreshes too
[2:27:20] <%BestTeaMaker> Trinity/Octavia/Wisp for maximum buffs
[2:27:33] <+SolverCODO> Yes
[2:27:35] <%doc_ock_rokc> @BestTeaMaker actually wisps shock messes with octavia's mallet so it causes problems
[2:27:36] <+Manjove> also, dat ass
[2:27:36] <Inebriateddonut> She can fire THE SUN at people
[2:27:39] <%FrustratedAF> hey chat how's the space dolls?
[2:27:39] <Tennochief> yes
[2:27:40] <SummonerMagno> has a great butt
[2:27:41] <+Boombay1213> Nah he got one
[2:27:42] <ShinyMonger> She works really well. All her abilitys are pretty well thought out.
[2:27:43] <AsterBodhran> Yeah. that's atlas deluxe's rumblers
[2:27:43] <%TheWinged7> poor punch boy :(
[2:27:44] <gunzerkingdunce> they gave like a week n a half
[2:27:44] <waifoong98> wisp teleport lol
[2:27:45] <MasterDecoder> He got a Rework
[2:27:45] <LeftOverPizza13> atlas already got reworked
[2:27:47] <Tennochief> Atlas already got one and he's better
[2:27:49] <$RubberFistFight> @Tennochief lol yeah, i've followed Pat for a while, I occasionally draw the ire of both Robomods and REAL mods.
[2:27:50] <worldbrand> He got a slight rework with the rubble. He's... okay
[2:27:51] <+Fynale> wukong also got reworked
[2:27:53] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Wisp + Aero Vantage is fucking awesome
[2:27:53] <Nina96> is that ayatan treasure nightwave gone?
[2:27:55] <+xRyansito> tried wukong yet? his rework is fantastic @AngriestPat
[2:27:57] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat Atlas is okay but he isn't meta
[2:27:58] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> He got a rework but it sucked
[2:28:00] <fruit_pie_the_magician> but also patagium
[2:28:01] <ShinyMonger> S'why I main Nezha
[2:28:02] <%sshen> rework soon for atlas
[2:28:04] <%BestTeaMaker> that's fine, tbh, cause her 3 is more valuable
[2:28:06] <+ner0romanov> Atlas main here. He needs another rework. like, it's super bad.
[2:28:09] <%doc_ock_rokc> Pablo also created nulifiers
[2:28:11] <OldOnyx> atlas is underrated and is really nice for about half the events
[2:28:11] <Tennochief> @RubberFistFight damn, what a bad boy, lol
[2:28:13] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Atlas is a GOd man.... hatchu talkin bout?
[2:28:27] <InugamiTheHound> life of Pablo?
[2:28:27] <+xRyansito> made nidus too
[2:28:33] <+Cybercobra2> "doesnt he suck ass" as i have top damage by far with just punching LUL @AngriestPat
[2:28:36] <%AncelDeLambert> sounds like quite the game mechanics wizard
[2:28:37] <worldbrand> Yep.
[2:28:37] <$RubberFistFight> @Tennochief god, I wish. I'm just a cantankerous shit, lol.
[2:28:38] <Goldenwolf98> @AngriestPat You need to try out the new Wukong hes amazing
[2:28:40] <%doc_ock_rokc> awwww
[2:28:40] <%AncelDeLambert> FUCK
[2:28:41] <Jodoxk1> stripLUL
[2:28:43] <dekkitout> Sounds about right
[2:28:44] <Nina96> BibleThump
[2:28:44] <%PaiRho> Noooo
[2:28:45] <%Ninestempest> what's wrong with ember :(
[2:28:46] <Tennochief> ow
[2:28:47] <waifoong98> PunOko
[2:28:52] <LeftOverPizza13> ember has been nerfed so much she's only good on earth
[2:28:56] <+gucci_sama> LUL
[2:28:59] <%AncelDeLambert> @Ninestempest they nerfed her
[2:29:01] <Manwad> ember's just a living sunfire
[2:29:01] <$El_Desperad0> :(
[2:29:02] <%Deadpal> and now wisp too!
[2:29:03] <Thannen924> Rework for Ember -> Delete
[2:29:06] <+SolverCODO> And fire damage is bad, and she isnt even immune to fire
[2:29:08] <%doc_ock_rokc> Ember needs a slowly building ablity like gara
[2:29:08] <%Darthwaffler> -+
[2:29:09] <+Fynale> ember could do something with lava maybe
[2:29:09] <%Ninestempest> @AncelDeLambert so why dont' they just... unnerf
[2:29:11] <%AncelDeLambert> Ember needs real love
[2:29:11] <Tennochief> @Ninestempest DE nerfed her to hell instead of fixing the enemies problem
[2:29:12] <Arweynn> And Limbo
[2:29:13] <+blaccbird914> but i lover her sooooo much :(
[2:29:13] <+RushUnplugged> Ember problem is Saryn not being nerfed for.. REASONS?!?
[2:29:16] <+xRyansito> i use khora in place of her
[2:29:16] <fatalDestiny> Equinox, Saryn, Gara, maybe a few others, yeah,
[2:29:26] <waifoong98> She used be able to surv bc of her range, now they nerfed her range...
[2:29:28] <%GarbageNirvana> Give Ember meter
[2:29:28] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Saryns been nerfed like four times
[2:29:29] <%doc_ock_rokc> God Gara's Touch of death is BROKEN
[2:29:30] <Tennochief> they nerfed her because she was doing her job
[2:29:32] <%GarbageNirvana> Let her build up nukes
[2:29:40] <greatersea> I think a really good change for ember would be to bring back her overheat ability, she's one of the only caster frames without a good source of survivability
[2:29:42] <%AncelDeLambert> @doc_ock_rokc I know I love it
[2:29:43] <Inebriateddonut> THat's deep
[2:29:44] <%Emperor_Machinus> aren't they though?
[2:29:46] <Sol_Install> good, keeps you on your toes
[2:29:51] <Tennochief> andthen made her suck at her job in order to make her better at her job
[2:29:54] <$RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat You can't trust anyone though Pat so how are they not? Kappa
[2:29:55] <IntrepidEye> Wisp shoot the Sun. Ember needs to turn into the Sun and just walk around incinerating everything
[2:29:55] <%sshen> "ember is too good at clearing rooms lets nerf her into the ground" "lets also let saryn nuke the entire solar system with her 4"
[2:29:58] <greatersea> also, like, does anyone even use her ring of fire? :D
[2:30:01] <worldbrand> it's kinda what revenant's 4 should have been but his is fine
[2:30:06] <Goldenwolf98> I still want Equinox to get a rework to make it so we can somehow get the combined version in missions
[2:30:09] <%Darthwaffler> Ember was my favorite when I started. Now I'm sad...
[2:30:10] <%doc_ock_rokc> And Gara's 3 makes disruption childsplay
[2:30:16] <+earthboy2k> any downsides to starting Warframe on ps4?
[2:30:28] <Tennochief> Revenant is fun
[2:30:28] <%sshen> Longer patch cycles earthboy
[2:30:31] <%cybermooseblue> Ember’s Prime skin still isn’t rigged right
[2:30:34] <waifoong98> @doc_ock_rokc Gara 3? Her worst ability?
[2:30:35] <%GarbageNirvana> @earthboy2k No cross-play
[2:30:36] <Inebriateddonut> @earthboy2k consoles get updates later than PC
[2:30:36] <%Tearonex> @AngriestPat thoughts on Oberon?
[2:30:37] <%doc_ock_rokc> @earthboy2k its on the ps4
[2:30:41] <Thannen924> Also waiting on that Ember Deluxe skin..... for like....... a long time
[2:30:43] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Revenant makes the index into a walk in the park
[2:30:46] <%AncelDeLambert> @greatersea Ember 2 into 3 clears a room pretty well
[2:30:50] <Tennochief> spin 2 in
[2:30:51] <Tennochief> win
[2:30:55] <%doc_ock_rokc> @waifoong98 you are so wrong you don't even know her 3 works on everything
[2:30:56] <$RubberFistFight> Xbox One 2
[2:30:58] <thwak> is there crossplay for any other consoles?
[2:30:59] <+earthboy2k> thanks everyone
[2:31:01] <ShinyMonger> Well, there's no tennogen so there's that.
[2:31:04] <dekkitout> Wait, I've only heard Gara's 2 put Disruption on auto pilot
[2:31:05] <waifoong98> @doc_ock_rokc how does it works then?
[2:31:11] <%nyghtmare42> no crossplay.. delayed release of new content vs PC
[2:31:11] <imshadow_35> have Ember turn into a Captain Marvel-esk fireball and just run around melting everything
[2:31:20] <%Darthwaffler> Revenant is inside Mirages disco ball.
[2:31:28] <+uncyderf> tennogen on all platforms dude
[2:31:30] <+SolverCODO> Also PC usually gets patches a lot earlier
[2:31:32] <worldbrand> Consoles get *some* of the skins, and as a bonus they can earn them for platinum
[2:31:32] <+JavaManJoJo> Tennogen gets ported over
[2:31:35] <tangoragahn> You can buy Tennogen with plat on console for even more free 2 play
[2:31:35] <+JavaManJoJo> just takes a while
[2:31:39] <%GarbageNirvana> Just a matter of what you like and if you're okay with delayed patches
[2:31:45] <bonzosan> ps4 sugtras are the difference
[2:31:45] <Nina96> ps4 has an exclusive color i think
[2:31:48] <+SolverCODO> Mirage makes any gun crazy OP
[2:31:50] <%Tearonex> hey chat does Oberon Prime suck?
[2:31:52] <socratetris> @AngriestPat I'm gonna wait for the Xbox 3-4
[2:31:54] <%AncelDeLambert> LUL
[2:31:56] <dekkitout> How can Mirage crash- oh, right...
[2:32:00] <%AncelDeLambert> good way to blind yourself
[2:32:01] <pelehami> Hello
[2:32:02] <+axebird> Try the simulor Kappa
[2:32:06] <%doc_ock_rokc> @waifoong98 Mod for range throw it on a demolist their null field can't puls it off and if they do pulse some of the mirrors it does MASSIVE damage to them
[2:32:09] <$RubberFistFight> is the only way to get plat by spending real money? Or can you earn it somehow?
[2:32:15] <LeftOverPizza13> @AngriestPat InexpensiveGamer managed to hit the maximum amount of damage you can do with mirage
[2:32:20] <%BestTeaMaker> you can trade items for plat in-game
[2:32:22] <Inebriateddonut> @RubberFistFight you can trade with people for it
[2:32:23] <Thannen924> Mirage + Multishot ^^
[2:32:24] <%BestTeaMaker> people will buy things off you
[2:32:25] <+Manjove> trading for shit you grind for Plat
[2:32:26] <%Darthwaffler> Get a better computer, Pat.
[2:32:27] <%sshen> You can earn plat by farming relics, then selling them to people for plat
[2:32:32] <fruit_pie_the_magician> You can get plat by selling items and mods and weapons to other people who have plat
[2:32:38] <waifoong98> @doc_ock_rokc oh, that's new
[2:32:41] <pelehami> Garudas concept seems cool but is just kinda meh overall. Too many conditions to meet imo. Thoughts?
[2:32:47] <Kghaleon> You can earn it in game, if you like to waste your time.
[2:32:52] <$RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat I'm honoured that you consider my question important LUL
[2:32:53] <Nina96> yes but not consistently
[2:32:59] <%doc_ock_rokc> @waifoong98 it also works on any boss that can fit in the circle
[2:33:03] <HorribleHog> It's so easy to make plat in-game.
[2:33:05] <%AncelDeLambert> well, not FREELY, you still need to pay a credit fee
[2:33:12] <%doc_ock_rokc> @waifoong98 meaning you can make some bosses kill themselves
[2:33:13] <waifoong98> @doc_ock_rokc huh, good to know, thanks
[2:33:14] <+SolverCODO> So you gotta deal with real humans oh no
[2:33:14] <+JavaManJoJo> Technically you can get plat from the giveaways DE does as well.
[2:33:14] <Tennochief> the oroblem with free plat, is that people are SUPER fucking cheapskates
[2:33:19] <%AncelDeLambert> go farm gold drop axi bullshit
[2:33:21] <%BestTeaMaker> use plat to buy more slots
[2:33:24] <Goldenwolf98> New Wukong is so busted with the Zarr cause its clone isnt effected by its own explosions
[2:33:24] <worldbrand> it's true, i haven't spent a dime on plat and i'm mr27 with basically everything
[2:33:25] <dekkitout> Credits come easy with High Risk Index
[2:33:26] <imperatorjayprawn> I looked away for a while, what are those avocado babies that were floating around? I have not played this game
[2:33:32] <Tennochief> ike holy shit XBOX market is stingy
[2:33:35] <Thannen924> First platinums i made was from selling fishes to another player
[2:33:37] <blackorchidKI2> Social anxieties deny me the leisure of trading
[2:33:39] <%AncelDeLambert> @imperatorjayprawn Wisp stuff
[2:33:41] <%doc_ock_rokc> @waifoong98 that said its not a direct damage ablity so people overlook it
[2:33:44] <blackorchidKI2> And laziness.
[2:33:48] <$RubberFistFight> @Tennochief eh that's the same as the real world though. You always get people trying to haggle you down to 0, or alternatively trying to rip you off.
[2:33:50] <Nina96> @imperatorjayprawn a buff
[2:33:59] <holsety5> he thicc
[2:34:03] <imperatorjayprawn> Aaaaah I got ya
[2:34:04] <Nina96> its an ugly wisp
[2:34:07] <GodlyLuigi> ayy he has delux bod reg head atlas too
[2:34:08] <%Gogogolem> No one like my color scheme
[2:34:09] <Tennochief> TOA
[2:34:10] <GodlyLuigi> so beefy
[2:34:15] <ShinyMonger> Warframe has a really useful market phone app that makes dealing with the "other humans" a lot easier.
[2:34:22] <HorribleHog> Derelict missions for cursed mods, people pay 20-25p, Lua challenge mods for 10-15p
[2:34:24] <%Emperor_Machinus> Atlas prime is next
[2:34:25] <%AncelDeLambert> always always ALWAYS check Warframe Market before making a purchase/sale
[2:34:28] <Jeemukun> ah yeah, his new unique skin looks great
[2:34:38] <+gutlesscoward> spinning's a good trick
[2:34:40] <Goldenwolf98> Thats the one problem with Wisp the buff things look ugly as fuck
[2:34:49] <blackorchidKI2> Darude's Finest
[2:34:51] <%Deadpal> did you ever get the augment for sandstorm patr?
[2:34:59] <%Deadpal> that can turn it into an elemental spam?
[2:35:00] <%doc_ock_rokc> pat likes bayblade confirmed
[2:35:04] <%Deadpal> and make it so it does slash procs?
[2:35:06] <Inebriateddonut> The thing about Warframe market is that people constantly think those prices are THE prices
[2:35:07] <%Valdorick> gg
[2:35:08] <whobeee> @angriestpat what are your thoughts on the current state of Destiny 2?
[2:35:17] <Nina96> @Goldenwolf98 unless u color it just right
[2:35:17] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> Yo so excals new deluxe looks nut worthy
[2:35:35] <pelehami> Corrosive best overall element?
[2:35:35] <%Nymphonomicon> apatGib apatGib apatGib apatGib
[2:35:39] <%Darthwaffler> My Wisp buff doodads look pretty good.
[2:35:39] <HorribleHog> Primed mods from baro maxing them takes a little work but easy 300-400p
[2:35:42] <%killabubbadawg> @AngriestPat hi
[2:35:44] <IntrepidEye> Its okay.
[2:35:49] <dekkitout> Destiny 2 rn: PVP is a mess
[2:35:51] <MasterDecoder> @whobeee It's ok
[2:35:57] <$RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat so courtesy of your recent Yak6 streams I've just gotten into the series, started playing/streaming Yakuza 0. What a fucking delightful game it is. Also, Mr Shakedown is literally basically Jiren.
[2:36:07] <fruit_pie_the_magician> @AngriestPat Have you seen the ecal deluxe?
[2:36:11] <bonzosan> d2 is good.
[2:36:11] <%borkmire> warframe is destiny 3 before destiny 1
[2:36:18] <Goldenwolf98> @Nina96 even then I feel like they should have just made it out of energy instead of physical things
[2:36:20] <$RubberFistFight> that looks great
[2:36:24] <$RubberFistFight> almost like a robo-Artorias
[2:36:33] <+xRyansito> i have the same color scheme and same skins on my umbra as yours LUL
[2:36:35] <%Valdorick> Hey guys, wanna hear a Warframe joke? Anthem!
[2:36:35] <Tennochief> Needs more blue
[2:36:42] <blackorchidKI2> I love the royal colors.
[2:36:43] <IntrepidEye> what attachments are those?
[2:36:44] <Tennochief> lol
[2:36:45] <%bricupcake> so cool
[2:36:47] <+faithless_zealot> Now this is more like it, Pat!
[2:36:47] <%Darthwaffler> Pat, did you see that video that turned the Opticor Vandal in an SMG?
[2:36:48] <Nina96> god i hate that scarf
[2:36:49] <straw_glasses> What a cool doll
[2:36:57] <dretheroboticdeer> Is rhino worth farming?
[2:36:59] <waifoong98> The scarf ruins syandanna
[2:37:00] <HorribleHog> Ooh, fancy kneeguards
[2:37:01] <%mothmanfanboy> mothmanfanboy subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months! Your doll looks super cool Pat, we're all so proud of you.
[2:37:05] <Tennochief> Ivara deluxe is absolute garbage
[2:37:24] <IntrepidEye> I want that scarf on my rage kitty
[2:37:24] <MasterDecoder> @Tennochief It's ok
[2:37:45] <$NirvashTypeMQ> ily guyss
[2:37:46] <waifoong98> @Tennochief it looks ok until I realise, I wont see Ivara 99% of the time anw...
[2:37:46] <TerryTheTurret> @Valdorick Anthem's not a joke, people like jokes rooKek
[2:37:47] <+axebird> Opticor Vandal is almost a straight upgrade, I love it
[2:37:51] <Tennochief> @MasterDecoder it would be ok if it were for Gara
[2:38:11] <Tennochief> Ivara delux just looks nothing like her
[2:38:14] <%Valdorick> @TerryTheTurret Fucking Gottem
[2:38:18] <ShinyMonger> Aaaaah, the murder stick
[2:38:28] <LordScorp> looks like a goddamn king
[2:38:32] <drinkmilkstrongbones> what frame is that I want to kiss his feet
[2:38:36] <straw_glasses> The biggest reason I play this game is the fishing and movement
[2:38:43] <InugamiTheHound> Is pat a Lakers fan??
[2:38:46] <Fujiwara_92> Saint Row themed Excalibur LUL
[2:38:51] <%cybermooseblue> Looks like a Minnesota Viking
[2:38:58] <%doc_ock_rokc> those floating things
[2:38:59] <%Deadpal> it's the buffs wisp give you
[2:38:59] <Nina96> @drinkmilkstrongbones excaliber umbra
[2:39:00] <+Kareem405> the buffs
[2:39:02] <%Agami23> the eggs.
[2:39:04] <Inebriateddonut> BUild focused on her buffs
[2:39:07] <+mikesniderman> pat, get yourself a Redeemer
[2:39:08] <Jodoxk1> its the buff pods she has
[2:39:09] <+axebird> Her little buff pods. Maxing out power and duration to make the buffs silly.
[2:39:12] <Thannen924> Reservoir are the buffs Wisp put on the ground
[2:39:12] <ShinyMonger> Built for MAX BUFFS
[2:39:14] <%Deadpal> she's a REALLY Easy farm
[2:39:14] <worldbrand> Wisp's little buffs come from an ability called reservoirs
[2:39:14] <+gucci_sama> the floating eggs
[2:39:15] <dekkitout> So Strength/duration?
[2:39:16] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat those floating things that you didn't like
[2:39:17] <%Deadpal> I wouldn't suggest buying her
[2:39:18] <drinkmilkstrongbones> @Nina96 thank
[2:39:19] <%Zundelle> you pretty much build for strength and a decent amount of duration
[2:39:22] <Zombrocom> Resovioirs are the little deployables she puts down, touch em to get buffs
[2:39:22] <%Deadpal> she's super great
[2:39:25] <%Deadpal> but really easy farm
[2:39:29] <%Darthwaffler> It's her first skill. It buffs you out the ass.
[2:39:39] <HorribleHog> That scarf works great with some capes
[2:39:42] <blackorchidKI2> Also, a while ago I just found about about the Shield frame/ Big buff Zarya woman
[2:39:44] <+gucci_sama> go farm wisp 😡
[2:39:51] <Goldenwolf98> They dont look good with most color schemes
[2:39:51] <+SolverCODO> Max buff strength. Gives huge buffs to movement, fire rate, melee attack speed, health pool, health regen, and zaps people near you to stun them
[2:39:54] <+gucci_sama> Kappa
[2:39:55] <blackorchidKI2> There was no fanfare about this frame, but I like her
[2:40:01] <+Gr33nCutl4ss> i like em colored like eggplants
[2:40:06] <waifoong98> Scarf is fine, But I want to disable to wear syandanna on different config
[2:40:17] <+xRyansito> exalted blade was mind blowing when excal first got reworked, cant believe some ppl actually were mad they got rid of his super jump LUL
[2:40:20] <%Deadpal> directional slams are SICK.
[2:40:20] <ShinyMonger> Yup, no more manual blocking.
[2:40:25] <ShinyMonger> it sucks...
[2:40:29] <+mikesniderman> I agree
[2:40:32] <Tennochief> it's horrible
[2:40:33] <$RubberFistFight> is Excalibur one of the starting frames? It looks similar to the one I picked when I played before.
[2:40:34] <bonzosan> exalted blade made main him for years
[2:40:40] <+SolverCODO> Archwing experimental flight?! what is that
[2:40:41] <%Deadpal> yes
[2:40:46] <%Deadpal> excalibur is one of the st arting frames
[2:40:47] <+mikesniderman> the loss of Manuel blocking sucks ass
[2:40:48] <ShinyMonger> rip block combos
[2:40:48] <%Deadpal> he's the og frame.
[2:40:50] <Inebriateddonut> Super jump was a relic of a bygone era...but I kinda liked how he looked like he was dunking
[2:40:52] <Tennochief> block combos are a pain to do
[2:41:00] <%SirGO0SE> ah soothing sweet pat. always here when i need a smile
[2:41:09] <waifoong98> autoblocks make shooting redeemer annoying
[2:41:10] <%doc_ock_rokc> Excal is the posterboy for warframe
[2:41:19] <+mikesniderman> block combos still work, but auto blocking gets in the way hellllla
[2:41:21] <pelehami> Can someone tell me the best way to farm endo?
[2:41:27] <$RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat I'm re-installing this on my PS4 (slim, not pro), but I'm not very far into it. Would it be worth sticking with the platform or switching to PC? I don't mind losing what little progress I've made.
[2:41:28] <+gucci_sama> the devastation
[2:41:31] <pennykettle_> Hey I just got herem did he do Ropalolyst yet? triThink
[2:41:31] <bonzosan> excal is ryu of warframe
[2:41:32] <HorribleHog> Arbitration pelehami
[2:41:37] <Garry_Guyface> You know what we need? Vauban Umbra
[2:41:55] <%Darthwaffler> One reservoir gives you passive electrical damage in a radius around you. One gives you A health boos and Regen and the third gives a boost to pretty much every stat with the word "speed" in it.
[2:41:56] <%Deadpal> if you have an OLD pc it will still run well.
[2:42:00] <blackorchidKI2> I always hated that Excal's skins just look like re-skins of his default look. There's barely any dramatic changes to his appearance, except for Proto-Armor, kind of.
[2:42:01] <HorribleHog> To feed off of humanity of other Tenno?
[2:42:09] <%Deadpal> I ran this game off an intel cpu + gpu for YEARS
[2:42:16] <Shion963> yeah PC is very well optimized
[2:42:21] <Tennochief> fair warning about consoles
[2:42:21] <+gucci_sama> play on pc 😡
[2:42:28] <%doc_ock_rokc> he scream
[2:42:29] <Tennochief> Cursor UI is hell
[2:42:36] <+gucci_sama> Kappa
[2:42:41] <%doc_ock_rokc> Umbra is the elmo of warframes
[2:42:54] <$RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat alright sweet. I have an Xbone controller I use for PC, so I'll lose the swipe controls for moves, but that won't be a big deal. Thanks for the advices.
[2:42:58] <%doc_ock_rokc> his screams have power
[2:43:03] <%Valdorick> The star of the show and hero for killing David Cages?
[2:43:05] <bonzosan> i played this game on a potato once and it ran pretty well
[2:43:10] <+SolverCODO> he scream
[2:43:12] <LeftOverPizza13> the screm
[2:43:17] <waifoong98> ...
[2:43:23] <Inebriateddonut> screm big and eat own har
[2:43:24] <%Darthwaffler> One reservoir gives you passive electrical stun and damage in a radius around you. One gives you A health boost and Regen and the third gives a boost to pretty much every stat with the word "speed" in it.
[2:43:25] <%logoth_> Why does he have two penguin aerods floating around him
[2:43:33] <Goldenwolf98> @pelehami the best way to farm endo is mainly selling the sculptures that have been fully upgraded
[2:43:36] <Shion963> I played it on an i3, Intel HD3300 for the longest time
[2:43:36] <%AncelDeLambert> @AngriestPat do you have Garuda yet?
[2:43:44] <%Deadpal> no
[2:43:46] <pookam> not really no
[2:43:46] <%Deadpal> she's REALLY great though
[2:43:47] <Inebriateddonut> Nope
[2:43:48] <+FrostiePepper> Nope
[2:43:48] <+ArcLifth> no
[2:43:49] <bonzosan> no
[2:43:50] <Thannen924> Not really
[2:43:51] <%Valdorick> She does not
[2:43:54] <waifoong98> I prefer baruuks buffs visual
[2:43:54] <%doc_ock_rokc> Trinity is the lobester frame
[2:43:55] <%nyghtmare42> no
[2:43:55] <fatalDestiny> Nope, because her buffs only work on frames, not other stuff,
[2:43:55] <ShinyMonger> She's more of an all rounder
[2:43:55] <worldbrand> No, trin's main draw is free energy
[2:43:56] <%Deadpal> wisp is an EVERYTHING frame.
[2:43:56] <Inebriateddonut> Nothing will ever replace trinity EVER
[2:43:56] <%Valdorick> She's her own frame.
[2:44:02] <+ArcLifth> shes a different type of buffer
[2:44:02] <%Agami23> trinity is healing and buff. wisp is just buff.
[2:44:04] <%AncelDeLambert> Garuda is GREAT
[2:44:05] <%mh9s> and then he dies
[2:44:12] <%AncelDeLambert> I love my stabby knife gurl
[2:44:13] <LeftOverPizza13> @AngriestPat wisp does have a health restore option but it's a regen and not a full shield/health restore
[2:44:13] <+axebird> @Inebriateddonut Zenurik replaced Trinity for me lmao
[2:44:14] <Tennochief> Reminder, Harrow is a buff frame as well
[2:44:15] <ShinyMonger> She can buff, CC, and do a decent DPS
[2:44:15] <%doc_ock_rokc> Trin is still the extra battery frame
[2:44:22] <Tennochief> he's more DPS than support though
[2:44:25] <Thannen924> Wisp gives extra max Health, extra speed and shock stun around you; So really useful in sum
[2:44:25] <dekkitout> If anything she compliments Chroma/Octavia
[2:44:26] <HorribleHog> Garuda is incredible
[2:44:26] <%Deadpal> just tweaks to garuda
[2:44:29] <+Boombay1213> Little bit
[2:44:33] <pookam> shes trinity but she sacrifices pure support utility for FUN
[2:44:34] <%Valdorick> Harrow is amazing, and I will fight anyone who says otherwise
[2:44:40] <+Boombay1213> She's like A-
[2:44:40] <%Deadpal> baruuk is better.
[2:44:41] <+xRyansito> nope still lame
[2:44:42] <%Deadpal> he's still trash.
[2:44:43] <Tennochief> @Valdorick my fucking man
[2:44:44] <HorribleHog> She's not meta but so fun to play
[2:44:45] <Goldenwolf98> Garuda had busted insta kill shield when she came out
[2:44:48] <waifoong98> meh
[2:44:49] <holsety5> Baruuks fun. Just not great
[2:44:49] <+ArcLifth> hes middling
[2:44:54] <ShinyMonger> Melee rework was not kind to Baruk
[2:44:55] <SwindlerOfProgress> Were the odds against you?
[2:44:59] <%Comradeiota> His 4 is fun but not amazing
[2:45:01] <HorribleHog> Baruuk is great
[2:45:03] <Tennochief> Harrow's crit game is on point
[2:45:03] <IntrepidEye> I completely forgot he existed
[2:45:04] <%Deadpal> like I can do level; 150 plus content with him
[2:45:08] <%Deadpal> buit he's just so crap .
[2:45:10] <+axebird> You can put his alt helmet on to make his head look like a lampshade, it's the best thing about him
[2:45:13] <+FadingEmber> I refuse to grind for Baruuk
[2:45:14] <Caidezes> Seems like a lot of male frames are mediocre. DE is sexist, confirmed.
[2:45:15] <waifoong98> hey at least he aint ember LUL
[2:45:16] <Goldenwolf98> Baruuk will always suck cause they tried to make a frame completely passive
[2:45:24] <%Deadpal> HE'S BETTER THAN EMBER
[2:45:25] <%Deadpal> AND THAT SUCKS.
[2:45:26] <KingSpunf> I dropped off this game because my toaster laptop heats up like an iron at the open world zones T_T
[2:45:28] <%doc_ock_rokc> leave pat
[2:45:32] <HorribleHog> 360 invulnerability, pop your sleep, pop your fists, bend some wind
[2:45:41] <feoral> Hildryn is really good with a raksa Kubrow. keeps giving shield so you can do your 3 and 4 and shoot your 1 for forever.
[2:45:43] <%doc_ock_rokc> shoots sword lazars
[2:45:51] <Shion963> blade waves, son
[2:45:52] <DeathByPoke7> like strider
[2:45:53] <HorribleHog> >Baruuk is a passive frame LUL
[2:46:00] <fatalDestiny> And the projectile for some reason pops nullifier bubbles, unlike every other warframe ability,
[2:46:01] <GreyJumbo> Nova prime is my go-to frame for most missions, I also love Saryn and Loki
[2:46:03] <Tennochief> fire rate+energy on kill+cc+ultracrits+supra vandal= MAXIMUM CARNAGE
[2:46:05] <DeathGodSkeith> excals 2 is the shit
[2:46:05] <+gucci_sama> its big dick dmg
[2:46:05] <KingSpunf> His Bankai is best
[2:46:09] <%Darthwaffler> Is Baruuk DE's attempt at a dodge tank?
[2:46:17] <bonzosan> crits, high status nonesense
[2:46:19] <+FadingEmber> the projectile piercing goes through walls
[2:46:20] <%itzduckez1> itzduckez1 subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[2:46:21] <%Deadpal> it is not possible without glitches
[2:46:22] <Shion963> and the projectile is considered melee attacks, so enemies that are blinded gets bonus finisher damage
[2:46:24] <MasterDecoder> @Tennochief Ember Deluxe and Nova Deluxe are worse than Ivara Deluxe imo
[2:46:25] <%Deadpal> baruuk is FINE as a dodge tank
[2:46:29] <%Deadpal> but like
[2:46:32] <%doc_ock_rokc> he screm
[2:46:34] <%Deadpal> you can't ATTACK for 2 seconds to TANK
[2:46:37] <%Deadpal> which is the worst part of it
[2:46:44] <waifoong98> dodge tank in a Horde game LUL
[2:46:45] <LeftOverPizza13> and you can fly with his 1
[2:46:47] <Caidezes> angery boi
[2:46:47] <$RubberFistFight> Oh shit a new subscriber alert. Nice.
[2:46:54] <%itzduckez1> love all your stuff pat keep it up gotta go back to work
[2:46:54] <+axebird> To be fair, Baruuk has some cool stuff about him, but having a defensive ability that literally only works when you're not attacking is nonsense in a game about constantly attacking
[2:47:01] <bonzosan> umbra's 4 also has a sliding 2
[2:47:01] <HorribleHog> That's why you have the schleep
[2:47:03] <socratetris> Can't take them ALL off, but just keep the Skiajati equipped and you've got your sword-only Spac-mo
[2:47:05] <$RubberFistFight> I need to get custom shit for mine. No monies 2 pay anyone though :'(
[2:47:12] <%Darthwaffler> That does suck.
[2:47:20] <%doc_ock_rokc> @axebird its for healing teammates and stuff
[2:47:25] <feoral> also Hildryn has like... 3-4k shields.
[2:47:27] <Tennochief> That Atlas is Toa Onua
[2:47:29] <TheCoolerbluefooddye> Tenno SKOOM DansGame
[2:47:34] <%doc_ock_rokc> ded
[2:47:36] <LordScorp> can umbra's scream be the donation alert
[2:47:42] <HorribleHog> What is the real problem of baruuk is your teammates not letting you build up rage
[2:47:54] <%Deadpal> his 3 USED to be op as hell
[2:47:58] <%doc_ock_rokc> it does armor damage
[2:47:58] <%Deadpal> but nowadays it sucks.
[2:48:05] <%Deadpal> his 2 on umbra is AMAZING.
[2:48:05] <Inebriateddonut> I wish his 3 synergized with 2
[2:48:06] <%doc_ock_rokc> but not base armor damage
[2:48:09] <+FadingEmber> Baruuk feels like he was meant to work like the move Bide from Pokemon
[2:48:10] <%Deadpal> his 3 has an aubment
[2:48:15] <%Deadpal> but it's better to use the augment for his 4.
[2:48:17] <+axebird> @doc_ock_rokc You can just go spoiler mode and revive people while invisible, you don't need to rely on a cone of evasion
[2:48:19] <KingSpunf> So what is Pat grinding towards?
[2:48:29] <holsety5> dat metaton voice
[2:48:33] <%Darthwaffler> Completion.
[2:48:36] <bonzosan> remember when excalibur had an ability to just jump real high?
[2:48:39] <MasterDecoder> @KingSpunf Nightwave
[2:48:43] <Tennochief> they really need to put that Conclave Atlas mod into pve already
[2:48:55] <InugamiTheHound> @KingSpunf nightwave
[2:48:57] <Goldenwolf98> @AngriestPat have you tried out the new Wukong yet?
[2:48:58] <Tennochief> being able to TURN INTO A RUMBLER, should not be pvp only
[2:48:59] <GodlyLuigi> if you have the berserk mod on, that is
[2:49:03] <KingSpunf> Ayy OK
[2:49:10] <%doc_ock_rokc> @axebird yeah but if you do guardian durasion build with a dodge build you can make everyone want to attack you and only you
[2:49:16] <+gucci_sama> ONE MILLION SWING
[2:49:18] <Shion963> berserk with daggers is dumb
[2:49:19] <HorribleHog> guardian derision on your melee is the tits for baruuk

[2:49:49] <+Gr33nCutl4ss> yes
[2:49:50] <MasterDecoder> @Tennochief All Conclave stuff really, there are some good sigils and skins locked in threre
[2:49:50] <LabTech41> As someone who likes to fully explore a stage and make sure I've collected everything, I don't think I'd ever get this game; you're moving like a rocket sled on rails.
[2:49:50] <greatersea> yep, 100 plat each
[2:49:50] <pennykettle_> triKEK oh no no no
[2:49:51] <IntrepidEye> yes. Shy has like 1000 of them

[2:50:34] <pennykettle_> I think Kavats ride on them
[2:50:36] <Maverick2736> It's so weird how the Prosecutor warnings still trigger after like 3 years since they got nerfed from being EXTREMELY BUGGY mini-bosses to being regular jobbers
[2:50:37] <Thannen924> decoration yup
[2:50:41] <%Deadpal> yes
[2:50:43] <Monkeyweed21> it crashes computers

[2:51:57] <+Cybercobra2> every now and again it will get a holographic ^^ face
[2:51:58] <LabTech41> does it DO anything, or is it just a box that spazzes on the floor?
[2:51:59] <blackorchidKI2> Literally a roomba
[2:51:59] <HorribleHog> Protec the roomba.
[2:52:08] <%Gogogolem> Pat are you gonna let shy outwhale you you clearly need 1002
[2:52:13] <+El_Bucephalus> Roomba lives matter
[2:52:20] <greatersea> @AngriestPat if you join a squad with someone doing their own syndicate mission, it counts for your total
[2:52:24] <Inebriateddonut> @LabTech41 yup just a spazzbox
[2:52:29] <%doc_ock_rokc> pat are you doing disruption next because I know how to cheese it if you want
[2:52:34] <%Valdorick> Shy cheated though - she crowd sourced her Roomba Horde
[2:52:41] <InugamiTheHound> purple and gold! Pat must be a lakers fan with Lebron and Davis on the team.
[2:52:50] <LabTech41> @doc_ock_rokc and there's a player that has a thousand of these things in their ship?
[2:53:01] <%doc_ock_rokc> @LabTech41 yes
[2:53:04] <%Deadpal> people bought them for her
[2:53:07] <%Deadpal> a lot of htem
[2:53:08] <Tennochief> Power of Three should be a main game augment mod
[2:53:15] <MasterDecoder> @LabTech41 Yea
[2:53:16] <Inebriateddonut> She made a video out of it
[2:53:19] <+Greywyn00> i just found out I can solo Ifrit EX with my SMN LUL
[2:53:31] <Tennochief> fire three arrows and consume 20 more energy
[2:53:33] <%doc_ock_rokc> @LabTech41 she is a famous youtuber for warframe people also send her mags to annoy her because she hates mags
[2:53:41] <Monkeyweed21> Nice to see pat is actually purple now instead of blue
[2:53:45] <LabTech41> was she trying to have people send her money for them the same way that pixie girl's trying to sell bath water?
[2:53:48] <pennykettle_> Has he done Ropalolyst yet? I need to relive my happy moments through someone else
[2:53:58] <MasterDecoder> @LabTech41 No
[2:54:02] <drinkmilkstrongbones> what mr is pat at?
[2:54:05] <%doc_ock_rokc> @LabTech41 no she doesn't show herself to people
[2:54:05] <Inebriateddonut> @LabTech41 no just the drones so she could tank her framerate
[2:54:09] <Hawajiggaba> Neat. Baro farming?
[2:54:09] <MasterDecoder> @pennykettle_ not yet
[2:54:11] <AsterBodhran> he said he's gonna do it at the end so people who want to avoid spoilers can dip out
[2:54:16] <pennykettle_> thank you <3
[2:54:36] <%doc_ock_rokc> @LabTech41 she has a fun personality check her out she is cipholon shy
[2:54:38] <$ArtemisCroc> what's pat's primarry?
[2:54:41] <%Valdorick> I know... think of the Nekros'
[2:54:45] <HorribleHog> Shy's cool her video edits are super funny
[2:54:48] <+Cybercobra2> ayyy, a fellow atlas in the party
[2:54:50] <Hawajiggaba> Looks like the Opticor Vandal
[2:54:53] <Inebriateddonut> melt away as opposed to dismembered, turned to stone, poisoned etc
[2:54:54] <SandNoodle> opticors great if you wanna lame it up and sit at the end of a corridor and shoot down it
[2:55:04] <MasterDecoder> @LabTech41 Quite Shallow on YT
[2:55:04] <%AncelDeLambert> big spoilers, fuck off
[2:55:04] <dekkitout> Is it Stand time?
[2:55:07] <%AncelDeLambert> be blind
[2:55:08] <SummonerMagno> stand mode
[2:55:13] <Goldenwolf98> Everything is a spoiler in this game LUL
[2:55:15] <Hawajiggaba> I think you're out of targets.
[2:55:16] <pennykettle_> I've heard that this mode for Umbra isn't great because he just takes a buncha damage
[2:55:17] <Inebriateddonut> AGH I CAN SEE IT
[2:55:17] <Clinnamon> Jebaited
[2:55:17] <dekkitout> ...
[2:55:19] <LabTech41> @doc_ock_rokc she was already interesting to me the moment you said she doesn't show herself on stream; most girls usually take up a third of the screen
[2:55:21] <%AncelDeLambert> he's... magnificent...

[2:55:36] <$LuchaDePucha> amazing... fantastic
[2:55:37] <+DannyBucko231> Holy shit I can't believe Umbra can do that! :O
[2:55:37] <blackorchidKI2> Thanks, space dad
[2:55:38] <%AncelDeLambert> I wish the umbra forma made ALL frames do thot
[2:55:39] <+SolverCODO> Excal Umbra is an independant warframe that dont need no tenno
[2:55:41] <dekkitout> As a Stand for Pat should be
[2:55:42] <%Faustgesicht> he's le tired
[2:55:44] <%vectorless_peon> lol Dad didnt wanna show of for you pat
[2:55:44] <Monkeyweed21> Wukong does it better
[2:55:46] <%doc_ock_rokc> @LabTech41 she was orignally an art streamer but got super into warframe. she is also mute
[2:55:46] <waifoong98> Duality is better LUL
[2:55:46] <pennykettle_> Glad the AI is so great that they made Wukong rely on it triKEK
[2:55:47] <+gucci_sama> you got this one kid LUL
[2:55:50] <socratetris> When You spam that SPOILER over and over, you can sometimes get the body to flop of the ground on PS4 @AngriestPat
[2:55:52] <Thannen924> Todd Howards : "it just works"
[2:55:56] <Maverick2736> His special Stand power is taking a breather
[2:55:58] <LeftOverPizza13> daddy umbra needs his monster
[2:56:14] <+enlightenedcorgi> How long have you been playing warframe for?
[2:56:14] <Hawajiggaba> Slashy slashy
[2:56:15] <LabTech41> @doc_ock_rokc warframe IS pretty artsy, so it makes sense
[2:56:21] <Tennochief> @Maverick2736 Hey Ya
[2:56:22] <+DannyBucko231> @AngriestPat You gotta find some enemies for Umbra to attack
[2:56:25] <HorribleHog> pennykettle_ tbf i'll still take that instead of what they did to mirage laeFeels
[2:56:33] <pennykettle_> I wish Excal looked as cool as the promo art
[2:56:36] <%Mega_dragon427> Mega_dragon427 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 2 month streak! Hat
[2:56:37] <InugamiTheHound> Umbra is Soul reaper!

[2:57:31] <+DannyBucko231> I'd say those are rookie numbers, but then again I only have 350 hours.
[2:57:34] <+SolverCODO> Cease and desist
[2:57:37] <pennykettle_> LUL I am glad you are in the DMs with Rebecca. Get them to upload your soul into the game when you die
[2:57:38] <%Deadpal> you going to London and visiting them would've been amazing
[2:57:38] <InugamiTheHound> I have over 500 hours in this game
[2:57:39] <$LuchaDePucha> just say "ya where's my paycheck"
[2:57:39] <worldbrand> tell them they're welcome
[2:57:41] <Goldenwolf98> Im gonna say this if you play Warframe I feel no sympathy for you if you get spoiled this game will spoil story things just by existing LUL
[2:57:42] <$RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat didn't you kick in a bit of funding way back when though? Or am I imagining that?
[2:57:44] <+SolverCODO> volt
[2:57:47] <holsety5> everyone knows TotalBiscuit invented warframe
[2:57:48] <+gucci_sama> JUST A MEME LUL
[2:57:51] <MasterDecoder> @Tennochief Just Conclave mods, or?
[2:57:55] <%Valdorick> 1333 hours... oh god... I only started may last year.
[2:58:01] <Maverick2736> @DannyBucko231 you gotta pump those numbers up, bruh
[2:58:06] <%Deadpal> as a crazy person
[2:58:06] <%doc_ock_rokc> @holsety5 no tb invented warhammer
[2:58:07] <Tennochief> @MasterDecoder conclave mods
[2:58:11] <Goldenwolf98> And it still is Kappa
[2:58:12] <pennykettle_> If Pat funded Warframe he would be using Excal Prime FeelsBadMan
[2:58:12] <Inebriateddonut> Glad I was a crazy person :D
[2:58:13] <%Agami23> it had skill trees!
[2:58:13] <%Deadpal> I really liked how complex and ninja it is
[2:58:17] <$KnivesEve> but your crazy
[2:58:17] <Tennochief> already looking at some
[2:58:18] <%Darthwaffler> I live in London. I should have went to Tennocon.
[2:58:22] <SummonerMagno> yeah, its such a normie game now
[2:58:22] <%Deadpal> eh
[2:58:22] <televisedrevolting> Now it's a good game for crazy people!
[2:58:23] <dekkitout> LUL
[2:58:26] <%Deadpal> excal prime is overrated nowadays
[2:58:28] <%ryome> Now it’s a great game for you!
[2:58:33] <%demegodz> Destiny 2 good now
[2:58:34] <Hawajiggaba> I wonder how many times you've told this story.
[2:58:38] <$LuchaDePucha> i thought it was a crazy farmer that got you into warframe
[2:58:39] <Wan6Saber> lol
[2:58:47] <waifoong98> now this game is a balancing mess LUL
[2:58:47] <$RubberFistFight> Oh damn that's right, it was basically "hallway simulator 2k13", I remember you ragging on it now. Not sure who I'm thinking of then. I'll blame it on my headache and stiff neck. @AngriestPat
[2:58:49] <Goldenwolf98> BUT THEY WERE RIGHT
[2:58:55] <DSD24> Wish Destiny 2 was good at release
[2:58:56] <Aydarkzero> thanks Curse of Osiris
[2:59:00] <pennykettle_> That is how I am with Jojo
[2:59:02] <thwak> stop watching law and order, watch the wire
[2:59:05] <Hawajiggaba> Screw Curse of Osiris.
[2:59:08] <%demegodz> Shadowkeep tho
[2:59:09] <%Deadpal> I hope at some point
[2:59:10] <%Darthwaffler> I guess I didn't go for the same reason New Yorkers don't go to the Statue of Liberty.
[2:59:12] <Fujiwara_92> Stop playing Warframe play Destiny 2 Kappa
[2:59:13] <%Deadpal> we get raids back in warframe
[2:59:14] <%valkuma> holy shit i started playing Warframe before Pat?
[2:59:20] <InugamiTheHound> i was bored and I didn't know what to play so I gave warframe a chance and I love it so much
[2:59:20] <%Deadpal> and we get 8 player open world.
[2:59:26] <HorribleHog> Yeah the early days were really messy. I ground Rhino back then and stopped playing.
[2:59:28] <Hawajiggaba> The best thing about that tome was one of the shaders. Beautiful bronze red blue thing.
[2:59:29] <Shion963> it was "stop playing destiny, play Warframe. it's better, and it's free"
[2:59:31] <%doc_ock_rokc> I'm thinking of trying D2 when it comes to steam this fall
[2:59:34] <Aydarkzero> can't wait for SHadowkeep though
[2:59:35] <Hawajiggaba> that expansion*
[2:59:36] <+DannyBucko231> And now worlds collide as Destiny 2 is coming to Steam
[2:59:37] <%Deadpal> I still kick myself for not playing warframe back in closed.
[2:59:42] <Hyphixsys> Space Mom
[2:59:45] <%demegodz> Shadowkeep is good
[2:59:46] <InugamiTheHound> destiny 2 is going Free to play soon
[2:59:49] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 3 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 12oz (360mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[2:59:50] <pennykettle_> WF unfortunately doesn't fill the void of "Gun number go up, gun number green" with randomly generated equipment
[2:59:53] <Hawajiggaba> Just the base game
[2:59:55] <dekkitout> Curse of Osiris is the National Dex debacle of Destiny
[2:59:55] <%demegodz> That too
[2:59:56] <$RubberFistFight> @DannyBucko231 [Powerman 5000 intensifies]
[3:00:07] <%demegodz> ???
[3:00:09] <%demegodz> It is?
[3:00:10] <Maverick2736> *5000 hours of gameplay later* "yeah, Warframe's pretty alright I guess"
[3:00:12] <Inebriateddonut> @InugamiTheHound you sure?
[3:00:13] <%doc_ock_rokc> @pennykettle_ might i suggest diablo clones
[3:00:14] <%Deadpal> curse of osiris expansion sucked.
[3:00:15] <%Deadpal> yes.
[3:00:19] <HorribleHog> Deadpal Don't, it was basically the same as these jobber missions, but only this and up to like, jackal boss
[3:00:20] <Shion963> I already own Destiny 2 because I got it for free, but my shit laptop can't handle it so I'm back to Warframe
[3:00:25] <%Deadpal> yeah horriblehog
[3:00:26] <%Valdorick> Save Pat, Gravimo
[3:00:26] <Hyphixsys> LUL
[3:00:27] <4shachar> destiny 2 is extremely good right now
[3:00:32] <%Deadpal> I jumped in to warframe in 2013
[3:00:40] <Maverick2736> that grineer did his best. He died valiantly
[3:00:40] <+DannyBucko231> @RubberFistFight This is what it's like.
[3:00:41] <%Deadpal> 2012 would've got me some more founder stuff though
[3:00:43] <4shachar> Forsaken was amazing
[3:00:45] <Hawajiggaba> Yay, kitty
[3:00:45] <$RubberFistFight> Man, Elmo's such a placid kitty, it's great
[3:00:46] <Aydarkzero> i would play Warframe but i have no idea what to do in that game
[3:00:46] <%Deadpal> that i missed out on
[3:00:47] <pennykettle_> @doc_ock_rokc I tried PoE but sort of bounced off. I've never played a game like that before so it was foreign
[3:00:49] <%Deadpal> FORSAKEN WAS GREAT
[3:00:57] <Shion963> @deadpal OG Braton Vandal gang?
[3:00:59] <%Deadpal> Curse of osiris was bad becuase we couldn't use sparrows.
[3:01:01] <%Deadpal> Yeah
[3:01:04] <%Deadpal> I have braton vandal NOW
[3:01:05] <%demegodz> Forsaken was a great expansion, yes
[3:01:08] <%Deadpal> but not because of the 2012 stuff.
[3:01:10] <+SolverCODO> I did a good boy once :^)
[3:01:11] <InugamiTheHound> @Inebriateddonut yeah 500 hours later is proof. I want to play more of this game try to get WuKong Prime.
[3:01:19] <%Mekhet09> Well it helps that that they left activision.
[3:01:19] <%Deadpal> wukong prime is great now
[3:01:24] <Tennochief> I wonder what would happen if Pat and Paige had an actual kid?
[3:01:24] <feoral> yo pat you heard the in-universe explanation of why they changed Wukong? he legit had 3 forma stuffed up his ass.
[3:01:25] <%doc_ock_rokc> @pennykettle_ yeah thats a bit much try torchwood its a bit lighter
[3:01:26] <%Deadpal> seeing the damage and range on his staff is DUMB
[3:01:27] <waifoong98> I played this game when Nekros and Nova were new
[3:01:32] <%Deadpal> feoral lmao
[3:01:35] <Shion963> @aydarkzero generally that way, find a pal to either lead you, or discover it with them. it's confusing to solo
[3:01:36] <custoadian> I started playing Warframe because of how enthusiastically Pat was hyping it up during their KotOR LP
[3:01:36] <Caidezes> LUL
[3:01:38] <waifoong98> before trading was even a thing...
[3:01:39] <%Deadpal> NOVA CHEATED
[3:01:42] <+Cybercobra2> they coudnt handle the pressure
[3:01:42] <%Deadpal> TO GET HER PRIME
[3:01:46] <pennykettle_> Pat are there any skins you love for Frames you don't play? I don't like Atlas but Karst is beautiful
[3:01:48] <Maverick2736> Atlas' golems are infamous for taking like 5 effin' minutes to punch something
[3:01:51] <%doc_ock_rokc> alot of atlas today
[3:01:55] <%valkuma> arent whips bigger range
[3:01:55] <Inebriateddonut> @InugamiTheHound I don't see how that tells me that Destiny is going f2p
[3:01:57] <HorribleHog> I wish EA games would allow you to upgrade your founder status, I was just a wee lad back then
[3:01:59] <$RubberFistFight> @doc_ock_rokc do you mean torchlight? Torchwood is a Dr Who spinoff.
[3:02:06] <waifoong98> man that fucking limited weapons slot was a nightmare
[3:02:06] <%Valdorick> Pat sold me Warframe Crack - it was the podcast where he talked about Archwings that sold it to me, laughably.
[3:02:06] <%doc_ock_rokc> @RubberFistFight yes
[3:02:09] <Shion963> @feoral that's a canned message for when they rework a frame you own
[3:02:12] <%Deadpal> @Inebriateddonut they announced at e3 destiny 2 is going free 2 play
[3:02:17] <%Deadpal> you have to buy the new expansions
[3:02:22] <%valkuma> LOL
[3:02:22] <+blewbeary> Longer than a gun?
[3:02:23] <dekkitout> I was half listening, did he say frame weapons can get rivens?
[3:02:24] <%Deadpal> but everything before the new expansions will be free 2 play
[3:02:24] <%doc_ock_rokc> @RubberFistFight brain is stupid
[3:02:34] <Wan6Saber> athFA
[3:02:39] <%Kravedarknesss> that's disgustingly far
[3:02:48] <feoral> @shion963 oh! didn't know. that's really funny. i was tired when I read it and fucking lost it.
[3:02:49] <Inebriateddonut> But isn't all the content in those expansions? @Deadpal
[3:02:53] <%demegodz> @Inebriateddonut Base Game, Curse of Osiris and the DLC that came after that are going f2p and other areas in future content is open for exploration
[3:02:53] <%doc_ock_rokc> @dekkitout wha
[3:02:55] <$RubberFistFight> @doc_ock_rokc all good. Man, torchwood was a great show right up until it suddenly wasn't anymore. "Miracle Day" was a goddamn farce.
[3:02:59] <%Darthwaffler> That stick is stupid, Pat. I love it. What are the parts.
[3:03:01] <+Cybercobra2> they should add a energy blade effect to show the extended range
[3:03:03] <InugamiTheHound> @Inebriateddonut oh sorry.yeah I remember reading online it was going free to play in september. I've enver played a destiny 1 or 2
[3:03:04] <%Deadpal> so everything before the LATEST expansion will be free 2 play @Inebriateddonut
[3:03:07] <KingSpunf> Expand Pike
[3:03:13] <%Deadpal> so forsaken will be free 2 play when the new expansion comes out
[3:03:14] <%doc_ock_rokc> @RubberFistFight just like most shows these days
[3:03:18] <%Deadpal> it's not free 2 play yet
[3:03:23] <%demegodz> No not yet
[3:03:27] <dekkitout> I did mention I was half listening, I heard "blah blah Excalibue, something about damage, ...riven"
[3:03:32] <$RubberFistFight> @doc_ock_rokc yeah.... :(
[3:03:34] <%AncelDeLambert> you and me both, Pat
[3:03:34] <%demegodz> in September when the new expansion releases
[3:03:35] <RileyOMalley> I really enjoy that build you got currently
[3:03:36] <%Valdorick> Just sell fish to the homeless
[3:03:37] <%goose_attack_almanac> EXODIa
[3:03:40] <worldbrand> At least you don't have to craft arcanes anymore
[3:03:44] <%goose_attack_almanac> OBLiTERATE
[3:03:44] <%AncelDeLambert> god damn I'M SO TIRED OF FISHING
[3:03:45] <%HiroTSK5> You need a What Part?!
[3:03:47] <televisedrevolting> What about that Hammer that's a ranged weapon?
[3:03:55] <+xRyansito> zimeGasm
[3:04:04] <dekkitout> Kripath
[3:04:04] <AsterBodhran> Press x guy
[3:04:08] <%Valdorick> Just the Plague Tip
[3:04:10] <Zombrocom> Plague Kripath
[3:04:13] <Thannen924> @AngriestPat you don't have to build Arcane now by the way, you buy them directly
[3:04:13] <%doc_ock_rokc> pat look at its appearance
[3:04:13] <%Agami23> @AngriestPat if you have the standing, you can go grab a exodia right now. they got rid of blueprints for arcanes i think
[3:04:13] <SilverFeng> show in equip screen doesnt it
[3:04:13] <$RubberFistFight> hahahahhaa
[3:04:13] <HorribleHog> [Plague Kripath]
[3:04:14] <+Cybercobra2> well thats a shame becouse plague star was like a month ago. no exodia for you
[3:04:15] <Slim_Lipid> FailFish
[3:04:16] <+dpython> go into weapon select to see the part
[3:04:19] <ShinyMonger> Plague kripath, strung, and Vargeet II jai I believe
[3:04:19] <AsterBodhran> It shows the parts on the weapon select
[3:04:20] <$RubberFistFight> DESCRIPTION 100
[3:04:20] <%doc_ock_rokc> Disruption time?
[3:04:20] <4shachar> @angriestpat are you gonna check out Destiny 2 when it comes out to Steam?
[3:04:26] <tangoragahn> Just link it
[3:04:30] <%HiroTSK5> do you need 5 parts to Obliterate?
[3:04:32] <kuningaz45> Kripath and Kroostra, dunno which ljnk
[3:04:34] <tangoragahn> Use [Zaw]
[3:04:37] <%Darthwaffler> Thanks!
[3:04:40] <pennykettle_> I'm glad Plague Star has come back enough so Pat doesn't feel bad about missing stuff
[3:04:47] <+Cybercobra2> yea they changed arcanes. you just straight up buy them. no BP's
[3:04:49] <+DannyBucko231> Same
[3:04:50] <+stupid_neko21> did you miss plague star this year?
[3:04:53] <%demegodz> NICE
[3:05:08] <%AncelDeLambert> @AngriestPat the zaw shows you what components it has when you look at it while choosing a melee weapon
[3:05:08] <HorribleHog> Arright, you guys have a funframe, i'm gonna catch some Z's lae7
[3:05:11] <dekkitout> Luckily on the free version you'll start at prior level cap
[3:05:12] <+stupid_neko21> ok good
[3:05:12] <+SolverCODO> but FORMAAAA
[3:05:13] <Slim_Lipid> You did not get enough Forma
[3:05:15] <Hawajiggaba> I think Plague Star was last month
[3:05:15] <ShinyMonger> Even the new stuff?
[3:05:19] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat they give you a free story boost past the year 1 story in destiny 2 with forsaken
[3:05:25] <holsety5> What new stuff?
[3:05:26] <KingSpunf> Squadalah
[3:05:26] <Inebriateddonut> Oh yeah there's also animal conservation on the plains now
[3:05:26] <InugamiTheHound> @AngriestPat hearing that destiny 2 is going free to play might make me wanna play a destiny game. I've avoid playing them myself
[3:05:27] <Tennochief> @AngriestPat Hey Pat kind of off-topic, but when you do start playing MHW on PC, you gonna get the Transmog and MH4-Frontier armor mods?
[3:05:28] <%Deadpal> they do plaguestar every few MONTHS
[3:05:33] <%Deadpal> I wish they rotated ghouls and plaguestar.
[3:05:34] <$RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat I'm curious, what CPU preset do you use in OBS for your stream?
[3:05:38] <Slim_Lipid> Just shoot birbs 4Head
[3:05:44] <%Emperor_Machinus> pvp
[3:05:46] <waifoong98> RIP Frontier
[3:05:46] <%Emperor_Machinus> xD
[3:05:50] <SummonerMagno> wait.. you can just buy them now???
[3:05:50] <%doc_ock_rokc> Disruption?
[3:05:52] <%Valdorick> BIG SPOILERS NOW bros and brahs
[3:05:52] <+Genocalypse> At this point, I only really ever do plaguestar for the prebuilt formas
[3:05:53] <worldbrand> LUL
[3:05:53] <%PaiRho> Im in pat,
[3:05:53] <%Deadpal> lmfao
[3:05:56] <Caidezes> LUL
[3:05:56] <SummonerMagno> ropopo
[3:05:57] <Tennochief> LUL
[3:05:58] <%mh9s> LUL
[3:06:01] <%Deadpal> what did you want to do pat?
[3:06:10] <%Deadpal> disruption is story spoilers.
[3:06:14] <worldbrand> Those demolysts got way beefier than in the event
[3:06:14] <%Deadpal> if you wanted to end
[3:06:20] <%PaiRho> Whats the ingame name?
[3:06:24] <LabTech41> is it time to get ALL the Warriors?
[3:06:26] <%Deadpal> not might
[3:06:28] <%Deadpal> it absolutely does.
[3:06:29] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat I tried to fuck myself but my clone just wanted to be friends.
[3:06:34] <pennykettle_> Someone should tell pat about the confusing health bar bullshit that makes no sense
[3:06:45] <%Deadpal> confusing healthbar bullshit?
[3:06:48] <%king_wragles> Alright then, later chat
[3:06:49] <%king_wragles> Have fun
[3:06:51] <Tennochief> what health bar bullshit?
[3:06:56] <Tennochief> later king
[3:06:58] <worldbrand> Oh right. The health bar on the UI is the health of the demolyst, not the conduit.
[3:06:58] <shotgunspaghetti> !uptime
[3:06:58] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 7m.
[3:07:01] <Slim_Lipid> OH NO ALL THESE SPOILERS
[3:07:04] <%Agami23> its spoilers are more for nightwave
[3:07:07] <%Deadpal> this is mobile defense meet excavataion
[3:07:07] <pennykettle_> The Disruption health bar isn't the health of the thingy, the thingy cant die to normal enemies
[3:07:10] <worldbrand> You need to kill the demolysts, not defend the conduits
[3:07:11] <%AncelDeLambert> god, SHUT UP V
[3:07:13] <CalderGaming> how is alad still alive
[3:07:16] <SilverFeng> so what happend to infested alad v
[3:07:17] <$RubberFistFight> @Gogogolem damn, that's some next-level rejection.
[3:07:18] <AsterBodhran> Find the cheeeese
[3:07:19] <+dpython> disruption is fancy mobile defense
[3:07:20] <Slim_Lipid> 🐁
[3:07:21] <Tennochief> Alad V is now partnered with EPIC game store
[3:07:22] <%Deadpal> alad v is an orokin
[3:07:23] <%velemi> I love him
[3:07:24] <Slim_Lipid> StinkyCheese
[3:07:25] <%AncelDeLambert> @CalderGaming pure spite
[3:07:26] <+xRyansito> StinkyCheese
[3:07:26] <SummonerMagno> salad v
[3:07:27] <+DannyBucko231> Ol' Salad V
[3:07:28] <+Cybercobra2> @AngriestPat so basicly, find amalgams, get keys from them, use keys on conduits. kill demolist before it reaches conduit. simple
[3:07:28] <%Deadpal> so he's really hard to kill
[3:07:35] <%Valdorick> Kreygasm Backdoor
[3:07:39] <%Zundelle> tdogRat2 🧀
[3:07:42] <%doc_ock_rokc> Oh no, this build is rubbish
[3:07:45] <+KimberleyBlue> alad has a foot fetish in lore
[3:07:50] <shotgunspaghetti> doodNuts doodInjury
[3:07:54] <Maverick2736> Alad is so cartoonishly evil that it's difficult not to love him
[3:07:55] <Thannen924> Kill Amalgams > Grabs the keys > Activate shrines > Kill Demolyst > Repeat
[3:08:02] <DeathByPoke7> alad invented the marvel dc crossover
[3:08:03] <%doc_ock_rokc> @KimberleyBlue that explains wisp
[3:08:03] <Shion963> pretty sure Hunhow calls him Orokin because the corpus are Orokin citizens
[3:08:05] <superxinvader> owo warframe
[3:08:06] <worldbrand> It's a corpus blunt
[3:08:09] <%Valdorick> Corpus Blunt
[3:08:09] <SummonerMagno> shield
[3:08:14] <%Agami23> amalgams are gross
[3:08:14] <%AncelDeLambert> you like the new corpus shields?
[3:08:17] <jestrfestr> oh pat hasnt been here since the rework it seems
[3:08:17] <RogueMinja> Bring that Helios.
[3:08:18] <Maverick2736> it's a corpus thingymabob
[3:08:24] <Shion963> not that he's ACTUALLY an immortal
[3:08:25] <%AncelDeLambert> the amalgams look great, no lie
[3:08:32] <%Deadpal> canyoufeeltherush
[3:08:34] <AsterBodhran> Meta
[3:08:39] <%doc_ock_rokc> Alan went meta
[3:08:43] <pennykettle_> I love the rework. it feels so much more like the setting of a tower in a gas giant
[3:08:45] <%Deadpal> kill the demolyst!
[3:08:54] <+gucci_sama> its prob not blue
[3:08:55] <%Darthwaffler> Grineer shelds: Corpus Edition.
[3:08:58] <Slim_Lipid> ANELE
[3:09:04] <%AncelDeLambert> @AngriestPat the demolyst is hard to kill, but shows up with a waypoint every time
[3:09:06] <%nyghtmare42> Salad V, spitting his dressing at us no matter how many times we kill him
[3:09:10] <Frolomeo> Using umbra but no operator action?
[3:09:19] <rosemon5001> why do i have the feeling alan is hiding in a blackhole?
[3:09:19] <$RubberFistFight> @pennykettle_ are you actually on/in Jupiter though? Or just on one of the moons?
[3:09:24] <superxinvader> has pat done the ropadopalyst fight yet?
[3:09:33] <%Darthwaffler> Silent Hill: Warframe.
[3:09:36] <%AncelDeLambert> harder than everything else, anyways
[3:09:38] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat they gain resistances to your weapons overtime
[3:09:38] <CalderGaming> looks like pat's squad is kitted out for this
[3:09:39] <OldOnyx> not yet
[3:09:40] <+dpython> it'll get harder, it's an endless mission
[3:09:42] <+SolverCODO> @AngriestPat if you dont kill them fast enough, some become immune to that damage type
[3:09:43] <Inebriateddonut> usually hard to kill :)
[3:09:43] <MasterDecoder> @superxinvader Not yet
[3:09:43] <Maverick2736> @AngriestPat this game mode revolves entirely around hunting the demolysts
[3:09:45] <ShinyMonger> The mission is basically find key, put key in thing, defend thing from the other thing trying to explode it.
[3:09:50] <worldbrand> The keys drop off of Amalgam enemies
[3:09:51] <Thannen924> Now yeah but not in 20 minutes pat ^^
[3:09:52] <Inebriateddonut> Keys come from amalgams
[3:09:54] <+Cybercobra2> amalgams drop keys. @AngriestPat
[3:09:58] <BlueLunecy> Hey chat, I'm looking for a new clan. Anyone hiring? I feel like asking here is better than recruit chat
[3:09:58] <DeathByPoke7> you used to not be able to use abilities on them
[3:09:58] <ShinyMonger> the keys come from big, floating enemies.
[3:10:03] <Thannen924> gets harder quickly
[3:10:05] <waifoong98> @ShinyMonger so it is just excavation?
[3:10:10] <pennykettle_> @RubberFistFight pretty sure you are on Jupiter for real. I think the gas of a gas giant gets so dense that the corpus could build some sort of bouyancy system to keep the towers floating high enough
[3:10:13] <+xRyansito> just killed one
[3:10:13] <worldbrand> You just killed one, they're the half-sentient enemies
[3:10:22] <pennykettle_> The keys drop from any amalgams I think
[3:10:25] <%doc_ock_rokc> yeup
[3:10:31] <%logoth_> Leave no ass unkicked
[3:10:32] <+DukeMoose> @waifoong98 the defend points also have buffs or debuffs
[3:10:41] <%doc_ock_rokc> pat this is the new grind spot for end game
[3:10:42] <ShinyMonger> Kiiiinda, but the defense is finished as soon as the demolyst is killed and it works on a pseudo wave system.
[3:10:45] <Rudaius> I'm kinda new to warframe. What frame is this?
[3:10:47] <waifoong98> ah ok
[3:11:04] <holsety5> Excalibur
[3:11:05] <pennykettle_> @Rudaius excalibur umbra, a different version of Excalibur that you get later from a quest
[3:11:06] <%AncelDeLambert> too bad the mods SUCK
[3:11:07] <AsterBodhran> Yeah you got good teammates who ain't trying to fuck around
[3:11:11] <+gucci_sama> hype
[3:11:13] <dekkitout> That's Excalibur: Spoiler Mode
[3:11:21] <Inebriateddonut> @Rudaius excalibur but a different version don't worry about it
[3:11:21] <SaltyDongs> huumon?
[3:11:38] <superxinvader> dammit I just turned off my pc and now I want to play again
[3:11:39] <Tennochief> that sucks
[3:11:49] <+Cybercobra2> so the thing is that these demolists scale HARD @AngriestPat
[3:11:57] <MasterDecoder> @Tennochief well, if just mods, all those stance mods to see how they work or if they're good. The Daikyu Mod, Purifying Flames could maybe help Ember, Ash's Tear Gas, Frost's mod, Rhino's mod, Nova's, Mirage's, and Equinox's
[3:12:13] <+gucci_sama> @AngriestPat my fav new mod right now is aero advantage it gives you -100% gravity
[3:12:15] <Tennochief> @MasterDecoder thank you very much man
[3:12:18] <+SolverCODO> @AngriestPat also they become immune to damage types if you dont kill them quick enough
[3:12:21] <+Cybercobra2> now they are easy, soon they wont be
[3:12:21] <Thannen924> they're also immune to many warframe powers
[3:12:25] <ShinyMonger> Round 3 is rough if you aren't on your A game
[3:12:29] <pennykettle_> I really really really wish they didn't use two shades of blue for the towers
[3:12:30] <Maverick2736> a couple of the amalgam mods are pretty useful. They don't *all* suck
[3:12:38] <Thannen924> Keys drops from Amalgams
[3:12:39] <ShinyMonger> Round 7 is.... a thing...
[3:12:40] <worldbrand> Keys and conduits are on the minimap
[3:12:50] <%Deadpal> the amalgam mods themselves are neat.
[3:12:55] <MasterDecoder> @Tennochief No prob, those are all the interesting ones that could be good/useful outside of PvP
[3:12:57] <%Agami23> if you stick with your team its easier
[3:13:07] <pennykettle_> This gamemode is also a bit like Sanctuary Onslaught where you get more lore the further you last in one game @AngriestPat
[3:13:16] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> hi patty ;3
[3:13:22] <%Darthwaffler> I'm playing Warframe, while I watch Warframe.
[3:13:25] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> !uptime

[3:13:37] <AsterBodhran> "Losing is winning" Woolie V
[3:13:39] <ShinyMonger> Pretty sure the demolysts are immune to abilities
[3:13:45] <Buttku> dude sounds like potion seller
[3:14:01] <+dpython> go kill the beeps Pat
[3:14:15] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> One Key, Two Key, Red Key, Blue Key
[3:14:18] <waifoong98> that's some big ass key
[3:14:24] <pennykettle_> I want to see him solo the new Spy tiles
[3:14:27] <%valkuma> the amalgams are dicks
[3:14:28] <%doc_ock_rokc> Did you think we were joking?
[3:14:29] <%AncelDeLambert> TOLD YOU
[3:14:29] <Tennochief> this is not good
[3:14:33] <superxinvader> ez eh?
[3:14:34] <Maverick2736> @AngriestPat activating multiple consoles at the same time yields more rewards at the expense of having to deal with a demolyst for each one
[3:14:35] <Thannen924> "They seems easy to kill" Pat 5 minutes ago
[3:14:36] <ShinyMonger> they beefy
[3:14:37] <Manwad> did the demolyst just reeee?
[3:14:41] <+FrenchTact1cs> is coptrering not the fastest anymore? Been out a while
[3:14:46] <%AncelDeLambert> LUL
[3:14:48] <+Gr33nCutl4ss> use exalted blade
[3:14:51] <+xRyansito> coptering hasnt been a thing for years lol
[3:14:53] <lTaunto> @FrenchTact1cs yeah
[3:14:55] <+Cybercobra2> @AngriestPat btw there is a amalgam that can make a near perfect copy of your waframe, abilities and guns and all. its the dudes with MASSIVE heads
[3:14:55] <worldbrand> I went for like 2 hours during the endurance mode in the event and hardly encountered ones that tough
[3:14:57] <+dpython> now you'll see the true power of the sentients
[3:15:02] <lTaunto> you bullet jump now
[3:15:08] <%Kirby_Sauce> Cheer500 yes, that's right ladies and jokes! Kirbysauce finally got off the boat! He's competed his hero's odssey! He got to the discord! Kinda anticlimactic to be honest.
[3:15:24] <Tennochief> yay
[3:15:29] <InugamiTheHound> murder!!!
[3:15:35] <MasterDecoder> @Kirby_Sauce What about those checks? XD
[3:15:39] <%doc_ock_rokc> Now everyone leave the discord!
[3:15:47] <%GarbageNirvana> Of all the references I expected to hear

[3:16:05] <$rdark_ksu> can we go back to the robot city with the good song?
[3:16:08] <%AncelDeLambert> show us the threat he sent, Kirby!

[3:16:31] <MasterDecoder> Damn
[3:16:32] <%Comradeiota> scorched
[3:16:33] <Quizzeh_> LUL
[3:16:34] <%Ninestempest> wtf is "usual bullshit"
[3:16:35] <%AncelDeLambert> now spite Pat, Kirby, SPITE HIM
[3:16:35] <%Deadpal> LUL
[3:16:35] <%weissguard> Yeah, that's about right.
[3:16:36] <Tennochief> KIRBY THE HERO
[3:16:37] <%mh9s> gauntlet thrown down
[3:16:38] <%Kirby_Sauce> Gasp, how dare
[3:16:38] <pennykettle_> Pat this rework makes the story even more fucking confusing. Apparently Alad has been working with the Sentients to make the amalgams even before the player even knows what a Sentient is
[3:16:38] <SaltyDongs> F
[3:16:42] <superxinvader> I'm so glad Peach got you into streaming. miasHug
[3:16:43] <Heyestus> time for ascii dongs!
[3:16:45] <$RubberFistFight> Oh man I love new harsh streaming Pat.
[3:16:47] <Tennochief> Do it Kirby
[3:16:52] <dekkitout> Now I wanna root for the screwball, Go Kirby Go!
[3:16:56] <Goldenwolf98> Cant fuck up something thats already fucked Kappa
[3:16:57] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> pat buulis his pay piggies LUL
[3:16:59] <%Kirby_Sauce> The corruption shall be slow and subtle
[3:17:02] <%AncelDeLambert> last a year, Kirby, just to spite Pat, DO IT
[3:17:07] <%doc_ock_rokc> Why are you wearing things that apply pressure?
[3:17:08] <%Faustgesicht> Past life
[3:17:13] <$philoboy123> it's not used to being used very often
[3:17:13] <+Cybercobra2> no hair cushioning
[3:17:18] <voltage996> It’s the gout
[3:17:24] <%goose_attack_almanac> Probably the same reason "Does Paige is the Gay" caused your face to explode
[3:17:25] <+gucci_sama> uses melee: Omae wa mou shindeiru
[3:17:25] <%AncelDeLambert> the mode is fine, the drop table sucks
[3:17:28] <$RubberFistFight> @Kirby_Sauce as someone who got the boot for being a shit on a level lower than you've done before, yeah. Don't push it, man. He WILL ban you, and you'll have no-one to blame but yourself for how shitty you'll feel when it happens.
[3:17:33] <%RobotPancake> woot
[3:17:34] <pennykettle_> If you're good you can do this really fast too, get all 4 done at once
[3:17:35] <Tennochief> @Kirby_Sauce influence them to be foot fetishists and destroy the discord
[3:17:39] <Hawajiggaba> More calcium for your skull bones or your face muscles are weeeaaaaak
[3:17:42] <%doc_ock_rokc> Or see ing them
[3:17:43] <%Faustgesicht> Cuz Babies have soft bones, obviously.
[3:17:49] <Thannen924> @pennykettle_ it makes sense but you have to dig in the codex to actually get how the events happened. But i agree, Alad V's story is the most confusing thing in the game
[3:18:02] <waifoong98> so solomode for low spawn LUL
[3:18:05] <%AncelDeLambert> a slowva makes this mode super easy
[3:18:29] <+Cybercobra2> you can also hear them with that loud beeping @AngriestPat
[3:18:30] <%Kirby_Sauce> Cheer500 on break, no time, this one's for Paige: If you ever get your dream of going on a date with a skeleton, bring some calcium. It's like viagra for these guys, make their bones hard.
[3:18:32] <socratetris> The focus is on you killing the Demolist quickly
[3:18:33] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat they don't get pinged until someone sees them
[3:18:39] <Goldenwolf98> Who at DE has a hard on for Alad V hes in like a shit ton of storylines in this game and hes so boring
[3:18:45] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AncelDeLambert Demolists are immune to slova
[3:18:46] <KingSpunf> I like how Warframe is this grim, weird-looking cosmic Forever war, but when anyone starts talking it turns into He-Man
[3:18:49] <MasterDecoder> @AncelDeLambert Just checked and can confirm, Syndicate statues do not eat into Daily Rep
[3:18:57] <%Kirby_Sauce> Kirby_Sauce is gifting 5 Tier 1 Subs to AngriestPat's community! They've gifted a total of 61 in the channel! 
[3:18:57] <+dpython> @AngriestPat oh man, Pat, if you like this melee weapon, you gotta try Wukong's new stick, it is not fucking around
[3:18:58] <%Kirby_Sauce> Kirby_Sauce gifted a Tier 1 sub to Thatghostpepper! 
[3:18:58] <%Kirby_Sauce> Kirby_Sauce gifted a Tier 1 sub to alternatecoyote!

[3:19:03] <%RioGascar> Woah
[3:19:05] <%doc_ock_rokc> @MasterDecoder they used to
[3:19:09] <MasterDecoder> I know
[3:19:11] <Quizzeh_> PogChamp
[3:19:14] <pennykettle_> @Thannen924 I started playing when Pat did and yea its so wack. I barely knew Alad's name when he appeared in Second Dream. Reading up on stuff like Operation Slingstone was fascinating
[3:19:14] <%kiiiirsten> Kirby you crazy bitch
[3:19:21] <dekkitout> Alad V seems like the Palpatine of Warframe "It's been me, all along"
[3:19:25] <$RubberFistFight> Kirby's just throwing money around right now. Wonder why.
[3:19:25] <RileyOMalley> Kirby with them subs!
[3:19:26] <+Cybercobra2> btw if you are going to do the boss. do it solo first. its a cool fight but can be done very quickly @AngriestPat
[3:19:26] <%kiiiirsten> Also I' have been drinking please excuse my goddamn swears
[3:19:36] <bear_breaker20> lol suicidal battle serfs
[3:19:42] <+DukeMoose> Thanks for "inventing" Warframe
[3:19:50] <Goldenwolf98> @dekkitout except in all storylines hes mainly a lacky to someone bigger
[3:19:52] <%AncelDeLambert> gg
[3:19:55] <%Valdorick> oof, close
[3:19:57] <+Cybercobra2> close
[3:19:59] <%nyghtmare42> gg
[3:20:02] <%Kirby_Sauce> Cheer500 going fast, makes me feel alive. My heart beats, in hyperdrive
[3:20:03] <Thannen924> that last one was VERY close
[3:20:10] <pennykettle_> I second the idea of soloing the boss
[3:20:13] <copyritetm> who is this nerd on the right
[3:20:14] <blackorchidKI2> That alarm sounds like a squeaky toy
[3:20:18] <televisedrevolting> They have ovens in this universe?
[3:20:24] <TheCoolerbluefooddye> How embarassing
[3:20:25] <waifoong98> tell your team mates to extract?
[3:20:32] <%Kirby_Sauce> Wait, who's that?
[3:20:34] <$RubberFistFight> @televisedrevolting future space ovens, yes.
[3:20:39] <+DukeMoose> both Alad V and Nef Anyo have to listen to the Corpus Council afterall, their investors, and stockholders
[3:20:40] <dekkitout> You can individually extract now
[3:20:43] <%Kirby_Sauce> Is this warframe or the warriors?
[3:20:45] <%doc_ock_rokc> Salad v
[3:20:49] <%demegodz> Kirby, once again securing his place as #1 bit boi
[3:20:49] <Tennochief> both
[3:20:50] <+gucci_sama> salad v and robo cops got rolled again
[3:20:53] <%Darthwaffler> You can extract seperately now.\
[3:20:54] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> yup
[3:21:00] <%AncelDeLambert> @AngriestPat hey, how do you like the newer Limbo skin?
[3:21:02] <Thannen924> you can solo the Ropalolyst, but you do have to dodge a bit, the beams really hurts
[3:21:05] <JacktheSleeper42> Solo extract is the best
[3:21:06] <waifoong98> it s only 40 mins Kappa
[3:21:09] <%doc_ock_rokc> nova

[3:35:53] <AsterBodhran> SHOOT THEN BIG SHOOT
[3:35:53] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> LUL PAT
[3:35:54] <+axebird> You need to knock it down by shooting out a synovia NotLikeThis
[3:35:55] <OldOnyx> need to knock it down
[3:35:55] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat blow up one of the back things then flip the switch
[3:35:55] <corrosivePaladin> It teleported away
[3:35:56] <holsety5> if it abruptly moves it means you goofed it
[3:35:56] <Sol_Install> it teleports pat
[3:35:56] <+dpython> yeah, you gotta hit the laser after you blast his ass
[3:35:56] <%demegodz> Hit the lever when you shoot the thing
[3:35:58] <jestrfestr> have to pop a joint to stun it first
[3:36:00] <Senselessvirus> @MidnightBurst12 no one knows
[3:36:00] <Nina96> @AngriestPat u need to kill its nipples

[3:36:01] <Inebriateddonut> How would you make it stay? :)
[3:36:02] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> You need to make it drop @AngriestPat
[3:36:03] <%AncelDeLambert> @AngriestPat it dodges if you don't hit it while it's down
[3:36:03] <+justianxix> Nice Loud Laser noise
[3:36:05] <%rosemon5001> after the stagger
[3:36:06] <trueGarnish> Jebaited
[3:36:08] <kerotuyu> Hit its weak point, then hit the button as fast as you can
[3:36:09] <%Wamennoodles> When you stagger it after hitting it big, then you use the lever, its a small window
[3:36:10] <%Valdorick> If only there was some way to prevent it from moving, like, some way connected to the fact it heals itself
[3:36:10] <+SamleyTimes> play harder
[3:36:11] <MasterDecoder> @midnightq2 It grabs

[3:39:14] <AlanJoestar> forsenWTF
[3:39:14] <%Bane_Kaikyo> you should reeally squad up for this fight
[3:39:14] <Thannen924> Even as Rhino, those beams REALLY hurts
[3:39:19] <Buttku> :(
[3:39:21] <%Deadpal> this one is a lot easier with a team
[3:39:24] <Nina96> @AngriestPat after the 3rd time mounting it just lower its health and hit it with big lazer
[3:39:25] <+axebird> You can roll through the lasers and survive them. They're really lethal, but not instakill
[3:39:30] <AsterBodhran> TO BE FAIR, Pat learned this way faster than most streamers I've seen.

[3:39:55] <%AncelDeLambert> well, yes and no
[3:40:00] <dekkitout> Technically, you were Kappa
[3:40:02] <Inebriateddonut> Technically amalgams are sentient :)
[3:40:03] <%AncelDeLambert> @JacktheSleeper42 yes
[3:40:03] <Thannen924> These are Sentients, flying sentients so yeah you got fucked

[3:40:35] <+axebird> @Buttku Yes but also no, it's unclear whether she's brainwashed now or was just deprogrammed
[3:40:47] <Nina96> yes
[3:40:51] <Zoh87> laser will still one shot inaros p sure, I had full cold aura/vex armor chroma and got baked in one hit
[3:40:53] <dekkitout> Is 'the voice' she's talking about "Man in the wall"
[3:40:55] <Crankthulhu> Pat really needs to do this in squad or just have someone carry him
[3:40:55] <worldbrand> They're all the same drop rate, but you need all 4 including main blueprint

[3:41:21] <pennykettle_> So do new players see Amalgams?
[3:41:21] <Zombrocom> Thats why she went evil when ballas took of the helmet
[3:41:22] <%Valdorick> I believe that - her kids farm for sweet builds, so yeah, must just run in the family.

[3:41:27] <Nina96> dig up
[3:41:29] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> de wai
[3:41:30] <Zombrocom> The helmet was the real lotus all along
[3:41:31] <dekkitout> Why does this backstory sound familiar
[3:41:32] <$RubberFistFight> sounds like she got reprogrammed and then deprogrammed a little too hard and she went kinda bonkers.
[3:41:33] <cinder_chan> space-deadbeat
[3:41:37] <Crankthulhu> Hot Take: The Lotus is a poorly written character atm
[3:41:40] <Nina96> dig right
[3:41:42] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> dis is nat de wai
[3:41:42] <+axebird> The Orokin reprogramming her to assist the people that destroyed them makes basically zero sense, so it's really unlikely that what she's saying now is actually true
[3:41:47] <$SvenHolgersson> hows your space dolls Pat
[3:41:49] <+dpython> remember wall running? LUL
[3:41:54] <Thannen924> You get all four parts of Wisp from this boss (BP, Neuro, Chassis,Sys)
[3:41:55] <thegreenbenis> WALL RUN
[3:41:57] <waifoong98> imagine if stamina is in the game and this map is like this LUL
[3:41:59] <thegreenbenis> RUN WALL
[3:42:03] <thegreenbenis> ON WALL RUN
[3:42:08] <%doc_ock_rokc> @axebird i think this is what her family told her
[3:42:10] <pennykettle_> The story is in an awkward part cause like, it could really go either way. free will isnt real. there is no real true lotus
[3:42:10] <Zoh87> dig up stupid
[3:42:11] <%GarbageNirvana> So from what I understand it's not so much that she became the Lotus when she saw the Tenno so much as the Tenno made her into the Lotus by being what they are
[3:42:12] <AsterBodhran> Pat's space parkour is rusty. almost like it's been a while.
[3:42:12] <$RubberFistFight> @axebird she's an unreliable narrator.
[3:42:13] <%Dylveryn> Pat is very good at Warframe
[3:42:16] <Crankthulhu> @dpython Do not blaspheme Titanfall's name by calling this "wall running"

[3:42:28] <jestrfestr> void dash pat
[3:42:29] <%FrostMass22> Wait. I thought the Orokin hated the Tenno. Why would they reprogram a Sentient to protect them?
[3:42:30] <+axebird> Pat you know your spoiler mode has an extremely fast long range teleport
[3:42:35] <thegreenbenis> @Crankthulhu More like Apex Legend
[3:42:35] <+Cybercobra2> he did it
[3:42:36] <tangoragahn> Datebayo
[3:42:38] <%GarbageNirvana> Like they really badly wanted a space mom and by some void bullshit that's what happened
[3:42:44] <%wizkid50000> Hi PAt!
[3:42:47] <worldbrand> @Crankthulhu this game did have actual wallrunning once upon a time
[3:42:52] <taptapmuhgap> @AngriestPat Question. You are aabout to bang Batman, doe you have him keep the Utility belt on or take it off?
[3:42:55] <Zoh87> at least in a squad if you reach the end it teleports the hopeless squad
[3:42:57] <Crankthulhu> @thegreenbenis Apex doesnt have wallrunning, just vaulting
[3:42:59] <pennykettle_> @FrostMass22 to use against the sentients? uhhhhhh idk
[3:43:00] <+WyvernsArentDragons> my guess is that Natah actually did love the tenno when she saw them, but her family sliced out anything they thought was "enemy programming" and removed that bit from her
[3:43:04] <Maverick2736> you don't even need to wall run here, chat, just mix your bullet jump with aim glide
[3:43:12] <thegreenbenis> @Crankthulhu You're right, I forgot.
[3:43:14] <Crankthulhu> @worldbrand I know then apparently it was awfuller than this
[3:43:22] <thegreenbenis> FAMILY

[3:43:34] <$RubberFistFight> wait why can we see the background behind her through her face? It's like there's a gap there.
[3:43:36] <worldbrand> It was a lot less maneuverable, but it was closer to wallrunning

[3:43:42] <%Valdorick> I had a FAMLY! family. family....
[3:43:43] <$RubberFistFight> See under her eyes/above her nose?
[3:43:46] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> Warframe is a game about FAMILY
[3:43:46] <Crankthulhu> Objective: Confront the pain of losing your FAMILY
[3:43:48] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat i think its more her mothers idea
[3:43:50] <cinder_chan> it is a gap shes floating pieces
[3:43:51] <+Cybercobra2> nope. alad is basicly enslaved by natah to do this shit @AngriestPat
[3:43:52] <pennykettle_> alad v kinda got blackmailed
[3:43:56] <%Afterman_> in retrospect..this seems like some superhero 40K shit doesnt it

[3:44:04] <Hawajiggaba> Alad V sure loves living though.
[3:44:07] <Maverick2736> Lotus went home and became a FAMILY MAN
[3:44:08] <+WyvernsArentDragons> if you scan the spoiler fragments, it reveals Alad V was actually forced to do the amalgam project
[3:44:08] <Thannen924> Amalgams were actually an idea forced upon Alad by the Sentients
[3:44:08] <OldOnyx> @AngriestPat remember chimera and what happened to ballas
[3:44:10] <Nina96> *hates
[3:44:10] <pookam> rope a dope
[3:44:11] <dekkitout> It was implied back in Chimera Prologue, no?
[3:44:12] <$RubberFistFight> @cinder_chan oh. Well. That's kinda creepy.
[3:44:12] <%doc_ock_rokc> Space grandma is evil
[3:44:15] <Crankthulhu> Alad V is kinda a dumb motherfucker, if you paid attention to the Wolf of Saturn Six story
[3:44:17] <Conky89> Well, back to the old grind

[3:44:44] <pennykettle_> OHHH SHIT :O Ballas totally got turned into a fucking amalgam
[3:44:47] <%GarbageNirvana> Ballas got what he deserved
[3:44:48] <+WyvernsArentDragons> Ballas was the first amalgam

[3:44:56] <%Valdorick> You know, everything Alad V says in this tells me that he needs to get laid
[3:45:00] <$ESP_ROOT> i dont know whats happening :)
[3:45:10] <$RubberFistFight> @Valdorick actually that would be "turbid". "Turgid" means "swollen and distended"
[3:45:12] <Conky89> Gotta deal with the Ballas to prove you ain't a busta!
[3:45:15] <dekkitout> And then Ballas was all like "Yo man, I fucked up, uh... take this sword!"
[3:45:15] <Zoh87> for real though instead of killing or saving lotus I want to amalgam with her
[3:45:20] <%doc_ock_rokc> @ESP_ROOT then go play the game this is spoiler zone
[3:45:24] <Nina96> @ESP_ROOT thats fine its all kinda stupid
[3:45:25] <corrosivePaladin> That special lazer will still oneshot Inaros
[3:45:39] <$ESP_ROOT> spoilers huh moon2T
[3:45:43] <Caidezes> 'Cause you get to be bad and still win.
[3:45:46] <Thannen924> Ballas came back from Los Santos with the Paracesis
[3:45:49] <LeftOverPizza13> i'm convinced the lotus has her will stolen from her, much like how hunhow could control and corrupt cephalons
[3:45:51] <+dpython> Nezha makes this fight ez mode

[3:53:22] <Hawajiggaba> Nice dance
[3:53:23] <Tennochief> yay
[3:53:25] <%kiiiirsten> Wow how Dead Space is this screen
[3:53:31] <Kghaleon> Wisp requires 1200+ hexanon, so it's a good idea to setup a titan extractor on Jupitor.
[3:53:31] <+dpython> say auger again?
[3:53:34] <Tennochief> that's a stupid name
[3:53:37] <pennykettle_> 6 PogChamp
[3:53:38] <%demegodz> Cool??
[3:53:39] <%Deadpal> so to farm wisp
[3:53:39] <%AncelDeLambert> you need SO MUCH MORE
[3:53:39] <waifoong98> LUL
[3:53:41] <$RubberFistFight> @kiiiirsten I used to be full into WoW but BFA was such a goddamn turnoff I haven't played since about a month into it.
[3:53:41] <%Deadpal> you do that mission
[3:53:41] <MasterDecoder> Two of those Amalgam mods are good PAt
[3:53:43] <Goldenwolf98> Need Hexenon to make Wisp
[3:53:44] <Zoh87> Ive been using the argonak with that lately its a ton of fun
[3:53:45] <%doc_ock_rokc> @kiiiirsten i'm waiting for it to come out but its better then current wow
[3:53:46] <%Deadpal> like 3 or 4 more times
[3:53:47] <%Dylveryn> Have fun farming that for Wisp
[3:53:51] <dekkitout> Hexanon, aka 69
[3:53:53] <Crankthulhu> Thank god you can farm Hexanon from Disruption
[3:53:54] <MasterDecoder> LOL
[3:53:54] <Inebriateddonut> A LOT of hexanon
[3:53:55] <MasterDecoder> XD
[3:53:56] <LeftOverPizza13> i think everything sentient controlled rhymes
[3:53:57] <+axebird> The amalgam mods are pretty sweet. Most of them aren't very good but they're all cool
[3:53:58] <%AncelDeLambert> you can just do a defense mission on Jupiter, it's fine
[3:53:59] <GPAlpha> You need Hexenon for Wisp and Fulmin
[3:53:59] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> rapapalips
[3:54:02] <%kiiiirsten> @RubberFistFight I stopped right when Mists started so I was never turned off
[3:54:02] <Thannen924> Yup about 2000 at least
[3:54:04] <AsterBodhran> "I'm gonna have fun making wisp" - Pat, who has like 116 hexenon
[3:54:06] <pennykettle_> Pro tip for farming the boss: charge all 3 generators before blowing him up
[3:54:06] <Crankthulhu> Mr. Ropopapolis sir!
[3:54:07] <%IDTheftVictim> it's hexanot very exciting
[3:54:12] <$RubberFistFight> holy shit my download just hit 11 megabytes per second but killed Pat's stream on my end LUL
[3:54:14] <+Cybercobra2> brownFIRST
[3:54:23] <+Greywyn00> is there no Alad V boss on jupiter anymore?

[3:54:30] <pennykettle_> no alad is still there
[3:54:34] <+WyvernsArentDragons> Alad V is still on Jupiter too
[3:54:35] <Shion963> did it first try, second time!
[3:54:37] <%kiiiirsten> @doc_ock_rokc I feel like Current WoW leaves too much content in the dust, I wanna get back into some good ol' Warcraft Story
[3:54:38] <%Dylveryn> Two bosses
[3:54:39] <+sixcubit> can someone explain to me how there are so many bases on a goant gas orb?
[3:54:40] <Inebriateddonut> @Greywyn00 he's on a different node
[3:54:40] <%Valdorick> There is, there's just two bosses on it
[3:54:45] <tangoragahn> Pat you missed Hostile Mergers right?
[3:54:54] <SummonerMagno> i did that fight first week... so buggy
[3:54:54] <$RubberFistFight> @sixcubit orbital stations, some of them are on moons, etc.
[3:54:57] <dekkitout> Ever hear of Cloud City?
[3:55:00] <pimpinahz> Pat, why your warframe blue
[3:55:01] <pennykettle_> @sixcubit massive towers that hold the corpus in a livable level of gas
[3:55:03] <%nyghtmare42> the regular exterminate on Jupiter drops hexanon too, think all of Jupiter does
[3:55:07] <Tennochief> nice
[3:55:08] <%Dylveryn> @sixcubit it's giant
[3:55:09] <$RubberFistFight> @dekkitout just thinking that myself lol.

[3:56:21] <Kghaleon> You're wrong tho
[3:56:21] <Caidezes> Limbo's the opposite of an eidolon though. Weird skin.
[3:56:23] <%kiiiirsten> Bloodborneman
[3:56:24] <+Cybercobra2> its a different take on him. i can apreciate it
[3:56:24] <+AWr00tBear> its almost inhuman

[3:56:26] <tangoragahn> Sentient Chinese Vampire
[3:56:29] <waifoong98> It is dumb, but it has decent color channel
[3:56:31] <%doc_ock_rokc> @GelatinBoi what feet?
[3:56:32] <+dpython> @AngriestPat there's also Atlas Deluxe and Nyx Deluxe
[3:56:37] <%GarbageNirvana> I'm surprised someone hasn't made a Limbo Speedwagon skin yet
[3:56:42] <%sshen> Pat could you show your catchmoon build?
[3:56:47] <cinder_chan> atlas' new skin is FANTASTIC
[3:56:50] <+JacktheMan18> I like the edgy look
[3:56:56] <+axebird> A checkbox to sync weapon colors your warframe would be sweet. I'm lazy so a lot of my loadouts end up looking extremely mismatched
[3:56:58] <greatersea> @AngriestPat use limbo deluxe body and graxx head with any floaty animation for ghost pirate limbo
