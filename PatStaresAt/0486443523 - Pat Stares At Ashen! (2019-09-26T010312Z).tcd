[0:08:30] <+Roundelay11> No block on 2h weapons?
[0:08:30] <%Calek> that's a nice snappy swing

[0:09:47] <FrankysDream> @AngriestPat does it have a charge attack?
[0:09:56] <Run44forrest> jesus
[0:09:57] <mankeyfigh> @angriestpat Why does this combat and lock-in system look like Dark Souls
[0:10:04] <lethallylactic> It's not Dragon's Dogma until you're accosted by wolves.
[0:10:05] <%Goldenwolf98> @AngriestPat you'll be doing some more platforming in this compared to other souls you have way more movement
[0:10:12] <HeadsHeldHigh> Are there parries?

[0:28:38] <+CaptainGrime> @King_Wolf_Rigger same here dont get me wrong loved the core of it i played on pc with crossplay and man the spawns would get really bad sometimes, and hit reg and character visibility in shadowed areas was awful sometimes

[0:29:03] <+Kaiserzelcor> FLAME SO MUCH FLAME
[0:29:04] <Louie_Salmon> Man I really don't like the idea of exploring a souls game with NPCs just walking up and helping. I specifically never summon anyone
[0:29:06] <%1matheuw> evrything is wool bait this days
[0:29:08] <%CappuccinoGuil> @cvp5127 *whispering* don't
[0:29:10] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> she's drelous
[0:29:15] <%Jrocy247> Her voice sounds familiar

[0:29:51] <%CalderGaming> also this reminds me a lot of Absolver
[0:29:53] <%Goldenwolf98> @Louie_Salmon with this game later on having a companion is almost a must
[0:29:53] <%rumtumtugnutz> BANDARMS
[0:29:57] <%CappuccinoGuil> Bataran is a giant or something, so he lives longer and thus, the sickness takes longer
[0:29:57] <+emperri> kill everything that's immune
[0:29:59] <%1matheuw> is that a kills quest?
[0:30:00] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> Tags: Vore, Heart Pupils
[0:30:01] <%CappuccinoGuil> I FUCKING LOVE THIS GAME, GUYS
[0:30:02] <%InugamiTheHound> bork breakers
[0:30:02] <arkv01> what luxury it is to have etwo whole arms

[0:30:14] <%InugamiTheHound> pup snuffer
[0:30:26] <f1shyish> this looks neat
[0:30:30] <%littleogre92> @sphincter_spelunker and every time you die, you lose another limb.
[0:30:33] <%TheBitingIrish> Did this get an update or something?
[0:30:43] <Louie_Salmon> @goldenwolf98 I guess it helps if it's built around it. I would have to see
[0:30:43] <%Puhff> Awww shit, I love levelling up a town
[0:30:44] <%NeroInfinite> Take his sticks
[0:30:56] <%InugamiTheHound> I hope Jokell doesn't die
[0:30:57] <%dalmek> your Score
[0:30:59] <$JoeJotaro> that's what she said

[0:31:12] <@SSaryn> WHOS TALKING
[0:31:12] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat scoria's a rock, they usually use it as a roadbase
[0:31:14] <+Zereaux> oh pats finally playing absolver
[0:31:14] <%InugamiTheHound> fuck yeah dark cloud 1 is amazing
[0:31:15] <%rumtumtugnutz> @firearmsinstructor it's okay, Detachable Penis was by King Missile so my question was a fallacy.
[0:31:17] <%umbypokochan> @AngriestPat you should play Dragon Quest Builders 2 then!
[0:31:19] <%aeonicvector> FUCK YEAH IT WAS
[0:31:22] <%Laecerelius> I loved Dark Cloud 2. Spent so much time building my towns
[0:31:24] <zenith0111> DARK CLOUD rmzGASM
[0:31:27] <%ThePeacefulDream> Yo, when's Dark Cloud 3?
[0:31:28] <garbageheaphound> its really good feeling
[0:31:34] <+emperri> scoria is almost like pumice. volcano rock.
[0:31:39] <%TheBitingIrish> oof
[0:31:42] <zenith0111> LUL
[0:31:44] <+YabbaTroll> agreed
[0:31:46] <ShichiNoBushi> It's essentially Minecraft.
[0:31:46] <CaptainFrankincense> nice bad opinion
[0:31:47] <Yukasmarvin> I like, but I don't like that the characters have no faces
[0:31:49] <%aishman> Man, this is like, such an interesting take on sthe souls games. It's very communal.
[0:31:49] <%Kiiper> totally agree
[0:31:51] <+YabbaTroll> its bad minecraft
[0:31:54] <%zamzoph> Pat hates chibi because it reminds him of himself
[0:31:55] <garbageheaphound> its not bad
[0:31:55] <%umbypokochan> well, i can understand that, but it is a fantastic game
[0:31:58] <Laveyrin> yeah minecraft does look a little blocky
[0:32:02] <%rumtumtugnutz> play Dq11 on Switch in 16 bit mode
[0:32:03] <%1matheuw> minecraft but anime is a terrible aesthetic
[0:32:06] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> pat has a hard stance on chibi
[0:32:08] <%RubberFistFight> @emperri yeah, only its usually reddish instead of grey
[0:32:10] <+LastHazzerd> social souls
[0:32:14] <$JoeJotaro> Pat is blocky chibi
[0:32:17] <Ner234> I never beat Dark Cloud 1 FeelsBadMan . The game glitched out on me after I built the robot thing. No clue how or why.
[0:32:17] <Fuzz_331> i mean of course you wouldnt like a chibi style since you live it
[0:32:18] <%lethallunacyx> Too close to home
[0:32:22] <%Laecerelius> Pat hates chibi because it reminds him of himself
[0:32:22] <%rumtumtugnutz> minecraft diablo looks like trash
[0:32:23] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> but you love cubes
[0:32:24] <%CappuccinoGuil> Notice how Pat picked up the items because they were piled on top of each other in one go
[0:32:30] <%TheSaintJohn> Pat hates chibi because he is one
[0:32:32] <sonofthedeepsouth> Oh ashen one dab on me
[0:32:33] <f1shyish> floof
[0:32:33] <+emperri> murderrr
[0:32:37] <HeadsHeldHigh> hounds she said
[0:32:37] <%rumtumtugnutz> fuckin
[0:32:38] <garbageheaphound> this calm ass atmosphere is making me really tense
[0:32:43] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> Pat HATES Chibi Because He Is CHIBI.
[0:32:43] <%RubberFistFight> @emperri I used to work for a concrete and aggregate company so yeah, scoria was a pretty frequently encountered product for me.
[0:32:45] <deviljhojho94> hating chibi while having chibi proportions
[0:32:51] <%rumtumtugnutz> dungeons or whatever
[0:32:53] <garbageheaphound> i keep expecting some real ass dark souls shit to pop up
[0:32:55] <%Laecerelius> follow the road?
[0:33:04] <garbageheaphound> for his quest
[0:33:07] <zenith0111> @garbageheaphound rmzSLEEP
[0:33:10] <deviljhojho94> thats ok because I hate chibi too tomatoCool
[0:33:18] <%rumtumtugnutz> yellow the follow brick road
[0:33:18] <%WackyGear> @AngriestPat find the pigs
[0:33:21] <%terribleusername> it's silly when a companion is a fixed quest giver
[0:33:22] <SilentGaming49> Always remember the image of Tall Pat. What Pat wishes he was.
[0:33:26] <%InugamiTheHound> bone spear is ready
[0:33:29] <%umbypokochan> if i could magically because a legit chibi anime person i would do it
[0:33:30] <+emperri> this is published by the same people as outer wilds so maybe the world explodes at some point
[0:33:33] <%umbypokochan> become*
[0:33:33] <%Bt_Robot> Careful, hollow bones
[0:33:33] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> how could tell without eyes
[0:33:36] <garbageheaphound> his quest was to find vorsa, and then vorsa gave you a different uest
[0:33:43] <rosemon5001> he is a spooky ghost
[0:33:46] <zenith0111> Ambient is the word for this kind of music
[0:33:59] <%furiousfurioso> As he is now he's basically a multiplayer companion, so he can't talk to you out there
[0:33:59] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> bamph
[0:34:00] <%CappuccinoGuil> POOF
[0:34:02] <lethallylactic> monkaS

[0:34:10] <%JonaFett69> JonaFett69 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 1 month streak! 
[0:34:12] <%Charuzu> seems legit
[0:34:16] <p_squid> Is this at all related to Absolver? Looks really similar.
[0:34:21] <LeeOhX> PAT HI finally made it to one of these, been a long ass time

[0:35:39] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @CappuccinoGuil Nice! does it have ghosts?
[0:35:45] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat stand on the rock and turn your lamp out so you can find the eye of the universe and save narnia Kappa
[0:35:53] <+emperri> don't you like CRAFTING
[0:35:54] <%FirearmsInstructor> Means crafting is no longer locked.
[0:35:56] <ShichiNoBushi> Crafting mechanics?
[0:35:56] <%CappuccinoGuil> Sidequests first cryGrump
[0:35:57] <%Goldenwolf98> @AngriestPat crafting is in the main area
[0:35:59] <+emperri> everything needs CRAFTING
[0:36:07] <%42nfl19> Look at that power hero stance
[0:36:15] <deviljhojho94> its kind of ambiguous
[0:36:20] <SilentGaming49> I can't wait for CRAFTING in Last of Us 2.
[0:36:20] <+emperri> I love when I find items 1/3 at a time
[0:36:21] <%CappuccinoGuil> @King_Wolf_Rigger nah, but I got some sick wardrobe and walk-in closet space. I have enough room for an extra PC monitor!!!!

[0:37:05] <%AnthroMetal> Pat, it's passive mp. If another player is in the area they'll show up as an npc. Otherwise they'll just be an npc. Them disappearing is you instancing.

[0:45:32] <%Goldenwolf98> Hes healing Pat
[0:45:33] <Flyrant> having a constant npc ally kind of diminishes any sense of tension the game would have had
[0:45:33] <zenith0111> rmzSHRUG
[0:45:36] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> He's healing
[0:45:38] <+emperri> LUL

[0:45:55] <ShichiNoBushi> "Now I hide and you find me."
[0:45:57] <+emperri> unlike pat, the boss possesses the means to heal himself
[0:46:02] <garbageheaphound> i believe that is in fact what he is doing
[0:46:03] <zenith0111> @anime_flux OMG it is a Heartless battle
[0:46:07] <lethallylactic> You outdamaged it before
[0:46:13] <garbageheaphound> casye he ate your light
[0:46:16] <Fuzz_331> its like dragon ball just go super sayian
[0:46:31] <%SubjectX07x> @Anime_Flux Either yer a man of culture... or an artist I know.
[0:46:34] <%rumtumtugnutz> tension is not this game's strong suit.
[0:46:50] <%SubjectX07x> Or both I guess.
[0:47:18] <AdmiralButtloaf> roach man
[0:47:22] <+emperri> jokell noooooooooo
[0:47:31] <%Goldenwolf98> The game gets more tense later on the early part the game feels easy and chill it gets a pretty decent difficulty spike
[0:47:39] <zenith0111> That's the no no damage
[0:47:43] <%Anime_Flux> @SubjectX07x shh, can't talk about my art here, this is a christian stream
[0:47:44] <Marpolo13> man down!
[0:47:46] <+PerrinIsDead> Is this a bloodborne?
[0:47:47] <%rumtumtugnutz> this doesn't seem like a very good souls like. maybe it's a Souls-lite.
[0:47:50] <Marpolo13> man no longer down!
[0:47:53] <ShichiNoBushi> Second stage!
[0:47:58] <CptHarlok> I kinda feel like this game straight up copied Absolver's aesthetic.

[1:10:27] <HeadsHeldHigh> should
[1:10:27] <%aishman> @AngriestPat This is more like...CommunalSouls. There is such sense of community in this game that I don't see in any Souls game.
[1:10:27] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> go hard on her
[1:10:28] <%solidousstream> bitch you asked for it
[1:10:28] <MicrotonalMatt> Put a tiny hat on that bard

[1:10:33] <SilentGaming49> man she hates you
[1:10:34] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> I love her so much. She got that bite.
[1:10:34] <SilentGaming49> I lvoe it
[1:10:36] <%Animorphimagi> she has too much personality
[1:10:37] <%Gogogolem> Is that the Beserk symbol above her head?
[1:10:39] <+ZephynM> The way that woman talks is kind of annoying.
[1:10:43] <+Zereaux> YOUR AN EASY QUEST
[1:10:45] <%dukenux> Does that mean you smell good, now
[1:10:48] <ミュウレ4242> i thought lyre was pronounced "leer".
[1:10:48] <%walternatorz> but now your character smells forever
[1:10:49] <Dementedpenguin> Jesus, I just realized she has some small ass feet
[1:10:50] <SilentGaming49> Get shit talked to. the quest
[1:10:59] <%Goldenwolf98> All she needs is a tiny hat and shes Pat bait FREE
[1:11:07] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Everyone got tiny feet in this game for some reason lol
[1:11:11] <zenith0111> Motorboat them titties
[1:11:13] <$FilthyHippie> @AngriestPat is this Absolver :)
[1:11:13] <%Animorphimagi> WHY does she sound normal now???
[1:11:20] <worldbrand> @ミュウレ4242 I thought that too but google says she's right
[1:11:24] <cherrycottontail> I don't know chat, I think she's hot
[1:11:28] <ミュウレ4242> very tall girls are also groovy.
[1:11:43] <%Jolnir> this looks like absolver
[1:11:49] <lethallylactic> Nearly +50 damage on the Iron club.
[1:11:51] <%InugamiTheHound> can you sell the other weapons
[1:11:51] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Tall girls are very groovy
[1:11:54] <%Animorphimagi> absolver 2
[1:12:07] <%Goldenwolf98> @InugamiTheHound nope no selling in this game
[1:12:09] <%Jolnir> is it actually
[1:12:11] <%Gogogolem> seriously thats just the beserk symbol
[1:12:28] <%Laecerelius> All Souls-likes must have at least one Berserk reference. It's the law
[1:12:31] <%WhereIsWill> absolver 2: dark souls boogaloo
[1:12:36] <%dukenux> berserk symbol is more 8 shaped
[1:12:42] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> nah, it's just a diamond, not two diamonds stacked on top of each other
[1:12:54] <%superc37> that is even more the berserk symbol than the bloodborne symbol
[1:12:55] <%Animorphimagi> It's Absolver 2, but Pat is calling it Ashen! because he's in denial
[1:12:57] <%Gogogolem> Don't trust these people they are working for Griffith
[1:12:59] <%dalmek> it looks like some uh Norse rune I think
[1:13:04] <%terribleusername> your destiny lies to the south
[1:13:07] <%dukenux> oh now i know what she reminded me of
[1:13:11] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> GRIFFIIIIISSUUU!
[1:13:18] <%InugamiTheHound> bitch

[1:13:23] <Darkfire346> SHOCKERRRRR
[1:13:32] <%CappuccinoGuil> Pat, select Vosra's quest and leave

[1:13:57] <Ominnous> chocolate wife comes to help
[1:13:59] <ミュウレ4242> jokell appears the second you unclench your butthole.
[1:13:59] <Darkfire346> look at that big fuck-off axe
[1:14:02] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Hey, look. We found our Sexica
[1:14:07] <%Goldenwolf98> depending on the quest you get that person as your follower
[1:14:07] <+LastHazzerd> Ax queen
[1:14:08] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Hell, yeah, tall lady to my rescue- I mean to the rescue
[1:14:20] <%shadowravennz> shadowravennz subscribed with Twitch Prime.

[1:14:49] <%demegodz> Time to get stronger enemies
[1:15:05] <+TeddyBrosefvelt> Just tuned in and this game is looking pretty nice so far
[1:15:17] <DrBeanie> looks like absolver
[1:15:25] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> jesus she's killer
[1:15:30] <%walternatorz> does the screaming sound like the squirrel from ice age?
[1:15:36] <lethallylactic> Take a drink every time someone compares this game to Absolver in chat. Kappa
[1:15:42] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> IT DOES @walternatorz
[1:15:44] <%dukenux> no dont
[1:15:45] <%TimetodiveLTX> they have kind of a DMC walk cycle, but the stride isn't as long and the run speed is slower
[1:15:49] <%floralkami> @lethallylactic no
[1:15:53] <%Goldenwolf98> I love the sprint jump
[1:15:56] <3xgilly> Pat and Paige co op would be unstoppable
[1:15:59] <%radda343> that's a fuckin jump
[1:16:02] <%Laecerelius> Yeah!
[1:16:02] <%InugamiTheHound> @walternatorz yeah the only good thing about the ice age movies
[1:16:03] <DrBeanie> Good thing i'm trying to die of alcohol poisoning
[1:16:09] <Ultra_Pancake> I can't find a list of voice actors for this game anywhere for some reason.
[1:16:14] <SpaceCatStation> this game looks really nice
[1:16:14] <%Jolnir> absolver souls
[1:16:16] <%Anime_Flux> Souls-like indeed
[1:16:23] <%floralkami> OMG, CAN WE GET ASHEN COOP COUPLE STREAM?
[1:16:25] <Ominnous> noooooo
[1:16:35] <Ominnous> chocolate wife don't leave
[1:16:37] <%CappuccinoGuil> @floralkami HOLY SHIT
[1:16:38] <%InugamiTheHound> jokell is back
[1:16:39] <Dreigun> I like how "Bonfire" is just the name of that mechanic now, regardless of the actual object/context in a game
[1:16:40] <%Goldenwolf98> @floralkami its only online co op
[1:16:43] <ミュウレ4242> if there are uncredited voice actors, one of them is probably geralt.
[1:16:44] <yeildingthought> How's low res souls pat
[1:16:48] <%Laecerelius> Jokell returned because you were too lame and stinky
[1:16:50] <+WutangchickeN> IS THIS MINECRAFT
[1:16:54] <%Kiiper> the rune they use for the quest markers is Jera it stands for year/harvest
[1:16:56] <%floralkami> @goldenwolf98 FUCK
[1:17:06] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> moustache man needs to show more skin if he's gonna replace axe queen
[1:17:12] <%Fidranth> google "ashen credits"
[1:17:25] <%Kiiper> THere is no VA credits
[1:17:27] <%floralkami> @goldenwolf98 maybe they can finally pull out that other computer
[1:17:30] <%dalmek> Jokell WAS the big woman all along
[1:17:30] <%Goldenwolf98> @AngriestPat Its cause you changed the quest to his
[1:17:35] <%Fidranth> there are. I'm looking at them
[1:17:36] <%Kiiper> Non-union game
[1:17:37] <a_mad_dragon> WITCHCRAFT
[1:17:38] <lethallylactic> She's just Jokell in drag.
[1:17:46] <+LastHazzerd> so the side quest tracked determins the fallower
[1:17:50] <%CappuccinoGuil> @AngriestPat It depends on the quest you have active
[1:18:29] <%Fidranth> Amara is someone named Lexi Klein
[1:18:30] <%floralkami> okay, who the fuck is Jokell and why are they such a meme rn?
[1:18:32] <%Anime_Flux> slinger hags are annoying
[1:18:38] <3xgilly> Pat do the big good that the big good good big
[1:18:41] <Ultra_Pancake> @Fidranth Thanks! I tried the official wiki thaat the website links but they didn't have it there for some reason.
[1:18:47] <%dalmek> @floralkami Jokell is beardy boy currently working with Pat
[1:18:47] <%CappuccinoGuil> There isn't a whole lot of difference between companions, though
[1:19:03] <%dalmek> moustache boy, I meant
[1:19:04] <lethallylactic> "Broken" is just the quality of the weapon.
[1:19:05] <RogerPoore> Is the game as easy as it looks?
[1:19:11] <%floralkami> @dalmek oh, I thought that was just npc man
[1:19:26] <%dukenux> "hold A to give up"
[1:19:26] <%CappuccinoGuil> @RogerPoore it's just the beginning, it'll get progressively harder
[1:19:41] <%dalmek> @floralkami he IS an NPC, but some NPCs seem to join you on your quest
[1:19:43] <%Kiiper> The Cast is kinda hard to find
[1:19:48] <%TimetodiveLTX> suddenly want to play hyper light drifter
[1:19:50] <%Kiiper> I missed it looking it over three times
[1:20:00] <%Derc127> Derc127 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 9 months! I want to stay subbed but I dont want a stream baby. Is there a pill for this or something?
[1:20:19] <Marpolo13> ears? lies
[1:20:26] <Quantumsheep1> Time stop
[1:20:31] <Ultra_Pancake> @Sh00s the game credits link is in tiny text at the very bottom of the page?? I noticed the official wiki link at the top toolbar first.
[1:20:32] <%42nfl19> @AngriestPat Jokel is your partner and your sidequest right? Does that mean you can swap partners?
[1:20:32] <%dukenux> thats a cyrse
[1:20:34] <%TimetodiveLTX> your only option is a 4th trimester stream baby abortion
[1:20:55] <%InugamiTheHound> can you learn how to swim?
[1:21:03] <%CappuccinoGuil> That's a don't ask questions about it thing
[1:21:08] <Quantumsheep1> No swimming
[1:21:16] <%Goldenwolf98> Coward
[1:21:19] <lethallylactic> BIG coward
[1:21:19] <Quantumsheep1> And you can swap partners
[1:21:26] <@Moobot> I don't know if I can trust that. (@Sh00s) (warning)
[1:21:28] <%floralkami> @timetodiveltx oof, press f for purgatory stream baby

[1:23:07] <%dalmek> I'm getting weirdly Witness vibes from the design
[1:23:10] <+mastertwin2> Is that Anor Londo?
[1:23:12] <%dalmek> Colours are way muted for that tho
[1:23:13] <derekwst3> i heard a baby
[1:23:21] <Quantumsheep1> Best girl here
[1:23:23] <%dukenux> Gentlemen, we found our Anor Londo
[1:23:30] <lethallylactic> D:
[1:23:32] <reiju_22> PunOko
[1:23:34] <Darkfire346> get the barrel!
[1:23:35] <Marpolo13> a barrel?
[1:23:36] <%Goldenwolf98> Yeah crazy girl shes great
[1:23:40] <%derekwst3> that voice sounds familiar
[1:23:41] <Tucker0603> adorable
[1:23:43] <%burgerdicks> is there a schtick with this game or is it just fort souls hybrid?
[1:23:43] <worldbrand> wait what was she going to do with the barrel
[1:23:50] <%Fidranth> the pass is impassable
[1:23:51] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> BARREL TRAVEL
[1:23:52] <%Anime_Flux> bunged up
[1:23:52] <%Conyst> Jester?
[1:23:56] <SilentGaming49> She sounds like that chick from Futurama
[1:23:59] <MicrotonalMatt> Worf beware that woman is dangerous
[1:23:59] <%dukenux> here accent is all over the place
[1:24:03] <HeadsHeldHigh> is she that girl from critical role
[1:24:08] <AdmiralButtloaf> what accent is this
[1:24:10] <%ssjklyco> Hey guys
[1:24:11] <%Jrocy247> Her voice Kreygasm
[1:24:15] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> every other noun she says sounds like it could be a slur
[1:24:16] <%Fidranth> Laura Post
[1:24:23] <%floralkami> I don't think it's supposed to be a real accent, guys
[1:24:25] <lethallylactic> She bae
[1:24:30] <%RubberFistFight> oh hey, a racist accent
[1:24:30] <%dukenux> me neither
[1:24:39] <+LastHazzerd> you dare question the daughter of a shepherd?
[1:24:41] <%Goldenwolf98> @Sphincter_Spelunker so shes british? Kappa
[1:24:49] <%Laecerelius> it's like they want you to progress or something
[1:24:52] <lethallylactic> Racist accent?
[1:24:53] <Marpolo13> go hard
[1:24:57] <+TeddyBrosefvelt> Can you get a rapier or dual wield short swords or daggers in this game?
[1:25:01] <3xgilly> how far can you zoom out on the map?
[1:25:07] <SenpaiMD> accents are racist Kappa
[1:25:12] <%floralkami> it sounds like borkenese, swedjap
[1:25:13] <Happy_Karl> It's almost as if the game wants you to progress through it. Weird.
[1:25:16] <lethallylactic> @TeddyBrosefvelt Just axes and hammers really.
[1:25:18] <%Jrocy247> @LastHazzerd "Mock" the son/daughter of the shepherd
[1:25:26] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> don't go flaccid on us
[1:25:27] <SourDoughRye> this is the worst french, polish, spanish, russian, swedish accent ever
[1:25:30] <%floralkami> topical podcast humor
[1:25:32] <%Goldenwolf98> We got ourselves a real MATCH
[1:25:35] <%ssjklyco> is it a racist accent if it's the actual voice actors accent?
[1:25:37] <Quantumsheep1> There are no usable swords in the game at all, actually
[1:25:46] <Quantumsheep1> Not sure why but they made a point of it
[1:25:48] <%Goldenwolf98> LUL
[1:25:49] <%derekwst3> she was harley quinn in a batman movie, thats where i know the voice
[1:25:51] <RupanSen> @ssjklyco of course
[1:26:03] <+TeddyBrosefvelt> @lethallylactic thanks!
[1:26:03] <%Anime_Flux> lol
[1:26:04] <%Laecerelius> Jump it, coward!
[1:26:09] <%dukenux> @Quantumsheep1 that reminds me of Torment actually
[1:26:12] <%floralkami> no you
[1:26:20] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> then the Ash filter kicks in
[1:26:20] <%dukenux> only one party member can use a sword in this game
[1:26:21] <%42nfl19> Mordor?
[1:26:23] <+TeddyBrosefvelt> @Quantumsheep1 makes sense now
[1:26:23] <%Jrocy247> Because all Accents are suppose to sound exactly the same. RIGHT AY CANADAINS?
[1:26:24] <LodiFrostbeard> music reminds me of populous 3
[1:26:28] <%dukenux> and not even a real sword

[2:03:21] <%RubberFistFight> @floralkami well he wasn't wrong about it being self-cleaning, that's part of how it works. It's designed to capture gross stuff, encapsulate it with a hydrophilic layer, and that allows water to just take it away.
[2:03:21] <kingdudeby> pour the body wash into your butthole.
[2:03:25] <Valdorick> But does she have spices and dye? Fresh the Urasia zone?

[2:06:08] <%derekwst3> @AngriestPat its not that hard, its basicly its own lube

[2:06:10] <yourliteraldog> tags large insertion
[2:06:10] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> That's true, I would be like "Damn, good job with the soap up the ass."
[2:06:11] <%rumtumtugnutz> he just wraps his weiner around it.
[2:06:11] <%renegadehatter> You would just let us know by bubbles flying up behind you every so often
[2:06:12] <+B00drix> i'll be impressed when the soap is still in the box

[2:06:36] <Rexwarrior1> Pat probe you can't on stream right now
[2:06:36] <+aslfrasle> Wouldn't that be something Pat is totally into?
[2:06:38] <%Cthulos> romantic rubber soap fist?
[2:06:40] <LaughingCatt> deep fisting & deep cleansing
[2:06:41] <ovan20> @AngriestPat if you put soap in your ass you would be crying with how much it burns LUL
[2:06:41] <+aslfrasle> Fisting and Cleanliness?
[2:06:41] <capo_lou> I big unused bar of Irish spring. way up in there.
[2:06:44] <SirKezington> Pat would buy dick shaped soap: 100% CONFIRMED

[2:06:51] <RyuuAoi> The BEST fist Kappa
[2:06:55] <%Guardiansaiyan> @aslfrasle Its next to godliness
[2:06:57] <BurningWigEmissary> this stream has been a treat
[2:07:00] <kingdudeby> mom says it's my turn to get fisted
[2:07:01] <omen_setter> Pat also sleeps in an oxygen tent because he believes it will give him sexual powers
[2:07:06] <mostundesired> All the time.
[2:07:08] <%FirearmsInstructor> @King_Wolf_Rigger I think I'm going insane.

[2:07:22] <%ShockzNDrawe> Pat tries to clean his insides with soap because the human body disgusts him
[2:07:22] <+aslfrasle> Clean in your ass is called an enema.

[2:07:34] <LaughingCatt> You never know, some people might be
[2:07:36] <%starotter70> But you somehow get your head up there all the time
[2:07:37] <Rexwarrior1> Pat I believe the opposite of everything you've said
[2:07:37] <Kratok> @Deadpal to do it on accident?
[2:07:43] <cureneckbeard> just tell her you put her soap up there

[2:09:00] <%RubberFistFight> @Rexwarrior1 yeah, they're good for cleaning all the tartar and plaque out of your ass Kappa
[2:09:01] <%miguelrod777> LORENZ IS A GOOD BOI
[2:09:06] <%ScreamLord> @AngriestPat That statement makes me wonder what kind of game Fire Emblem is
[2:09:07] <+NobuuNobuu> Lorenz makes pesants dry his balls?
[2:09:07] <%Divryne> HE DOES.
[2:09:08] <LaughingCatt> He would
[2:09:09] <RyuuAoi> Because you're trying to basically get into everyone ass in FE
[2:09:11] <+WutangchickeN> is this multiplayer?
[2:09:11] <%ssjklyco> That's a back of the box quote
[2:09:15] <%Laecerelius> It's a club sword?

[2:09:34] <yourliteraldog> time babbies
[2:09:35] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Ashe is best boi
[2:09:43] <%miguelrod777> Lorenz is better than sylvainn
[2:09:44] <%FirearmsInstructor> @floralkami Cherry Pie.
[2:09:44] <%RubberFistFight> @King_Wolf_Rigger I firmly believe Pat is no weirder on balance than any other random person. The difference is he OPENLY DISCUSSES his weirdness, whilst others pretend their own weirdness doesn't exist.
[2:09:45] <yourliteraldog> Bruce Banner
[2:09:46] <%Goldenwolf98> @AngriestPat the broken toothed club is really good
[2:09:48] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @floralkami mix them 50/50
[2:09:49] <SirKezington> I have a question for the Pat: If soap is so good at self cleaning, would you use it instead of toothpaste, AFTER A SHOWER?
[2:09:51] <LaughingCatt> @FirearmsInstructor thats something a peasant would say
[2:09:52] <%NeroInfinite> Bruce Banner
[2:09:54] <%Agami23> lorenz seems like the type of guy that would spray axe on his balls
[2:09:57] <%Piemen99> @floralkami Cherry pie

[2:10:17] <%floralkami> @galaxyswirl yes, these are some of da weedz
[2:10:18] <omen_setter> lorenz shoves an axe body spray grenade up his ass
[2:10:18] <Rexwarrior1> Pat has too much faith in the cleaning power of soap
[2:10:24] <%Animorphimagi> how do you send a message when you sub?
[2:10:25] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @RubberFistFight I'd agree.
[2:10:26] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> No joke. I keeping mixing up Sylvain and Ferdinand. Now I call Ferd boring Sylvain
[2:10:26] <+Jaysky> Ashen one ashen one-- touch--
[2:10:27] <%RubberFistFight> @FirearmsInstructor everyone's got idiosyncrasies, man.
[2:10:28] <%CappuccinoGuil> Pat, try the charged attack on new weapons. They tend to differ
[2:10:37] <%Goldenwolf98> @AngriestPat it has one of the fastest charge attacks in the game
[2:10:39] <%floralkami> 2 for Cp, and 1 for 50/50

[2:11:56] <%Goldenwolf98> @AngriestPat Use the bones
[2:11:59] <SirKezington> The only thing stopping this being a REAL souls-like is deaths attributable to shiity collision

[2:19:24] <lethallylactic> Fuck that wood

[2:19:31] <Ropcord> he said the thing

[2:19:36] <SirKezington> Give him a hand, Pat.

[2:19:47] <Teh_Un> Is that fkn Skullface?
[2:19:53] <+butterick> he a biggun
[2:19:57] <%Tearonex> That's fucking skullface 100%
[2:19:57] <SirKezington> It REALLY sounds like skullface
[2:20:03] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> no, I choked them out @Rexwarrior1 I used the type of choke that cuts off blood flow to the brain, rather than airflow to the lungs.
[2:20:03] <+butterick> srsly
[2:20:04] <%Laecerelius> Another giant woman?
[2:20:07] <%zamzoph> WHOOOOOO?
[2:20:36] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> GIANT WOMAN
[2:20:38] <harryboi1997> Go Dawgs
[2:20:47] <+butterick> nddbhd
[2:20:49] <%BappoSama> i miss hat girl
[2:20:56] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Leela????
[2:21:03] <+butterick> syphilittico
[2:21:07] <%Laecerelius> Now you can make more
[2:21:11] <lethallylactic> You turn arrowheads into ammo.
[2:21:12] <%Goldenwolf98> you can make more tho
[2:21:13] <%Jolnir> why are all the women so big?
[2:21:16] <%CalderGaming> it's not skullface
[2:21:24] <+LucentWulf> i keep thinking this game is made by the absolver team because of the artstyle
[2:21:25] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Cuz big women are great.
[2:21:27] <%42nfl19> Wait are you building a settlement? AH SHIT @AngriestPat you are stuck in Fallout 4!
[2:21:36] <%Goldenwolf98> @Jolnir cause the game makers arent cowards Kappa
[2:21:40] <+butterick> pupperWOW
[2:21:43] <+LastHazzerd> pat is smol
[2:21:44] <%mh9s> a spear with my name on it Kreygasm
[2:21:46] <%Laecerelius> time to upgrade!
[2:21:46] <harryboi1997> that's some hot fire I bet
[2:21:50] <%PauliusMaximus> that lady sounded like Katey Sagal
[2:21:51] <SirKezington> Look at this Motherbase shit
[2:22:02] <+butterick> she kinda did
[2:22:06] <lethallylactic> You've got tons of money Pat
[2:22:24] <Marpolo13> not poor PogCHamp
[2:22:27] <Marpolo13> PogChamp
[2:22:28] <%Jolnir> build a castle and fill it with amazonian love maidens. the end.
[2:22:33] <%Laecerelius> It's also a big upgrade
[2:22:40] <harryboi1997> gotta be able to see
[2:22:48] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @Jolnir That's the best story ever. 10/10
[2:23:08] <%CappuccinoGuil> There are fights where the lantern is useless, so 2-handed are better for DPS
[2:23:10] <harryboi1997> Big hit hard is worth the blindness
[2:23:12] <%Goldenwolf98> @AngriestPat not every area is dark in this game
[2:23:13] <Quantumsheep1> @AngriestPat The stunlock on 2-handers is for real and you don't need to use lanterns as much as you'd think
[2:23:30] <Quantumsheep1> @AngriestPat Also the reach can be very nice
[2:23:49] <%CappuccinoGuil> You should get the big talisman too.
[2:23:58] <Marpolo13> BIG
[2:24:00] <+nekodelic> relics are great
[2:24:02] <SirKezington> AND MY AXE
[2:24:03] <%Laecerelius> Eat your scrotum stashes, Pat!
[2:24:05] <%dukenux> kay, i gotta sleep. thanks for stream, and for a mental image of shoving an entire stick of soap up a bum.
[2:24:14] <harryboi1997> yeah that axe needs to see a doctor
[2:24:17] <+JacktheMan18> That's a nice axe to grind
[2:24:19] <+MysteriousDrX> I used that axe for 90 percent of the game
[2:24:22] <harryboi1997> too SICK
[2:24:36] <%Laecerelius> What's the power attack?
[2:24:41] <SirKezington> SHame it doesn't have a spin2win attack
[2:24:54] <%CappuccinoGuil> That axe is dope, but you get one later that has the same moveset and does more damage
[2:25:06] <Neo_Kaiser> They're masterworks all you can't go wrong.
[2:25:17] <Valdorick> Man, that animation has weight.
[2:25:18] <harryboi1997> Wow dark souls looks really different
[2:25:18] <%Goldenwolf98> Honestly most weapons in this game can be used for most of it its really just preference
[2:25:21] <%Dr_Mooose> ...
[2:25:28] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Gavlan wheel, Gavlan deal
[2:25:48] <%walternatorz> I thought she had a turkey on her head.

[2:26:15] <SirKezington> CORB-LIMEY
[2:26:16] <%ssjklyco> Corb Stomped
[2:26:16] <DSD24> Isn’t this game coming to Switch this year?
[2:26:17] <$i_am_therydon> I thought it said crab
[2:26:23] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Chartreuce Orb
[2:26:26] <%CappuccinoGuil> You should be able to do Ella's quest around this area
[2:26:27] <Valdorick> Corb Battle
[2:26:32] <RyuuAoi> The axe from Bloodbourne should be in Smash, Pat.
[2:26:36] <%Laecerelius> Corbs could be those big crab monsters he fought earlier
[2:26:38] <3xgilly> can you ignore every sidequest?
[2:26:50] <SirKezington> Corn-On-The-Corb
[2:26:54] <harryboi1997> Pat should be in Smash
[2:26:58] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Network error?
[2:27:18] <%CappuccinoGuil> @3xgilly finishing sidequests give you permanent stat boosts to health and stamina
[2:27:26] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> fuckin Comcast
[2:27:27] <3xgilly> Oh i would imagine, just wanted to see if it was possible
[2:27:28] <%ssjklyco> Soap on a Corb
[2:27:34] <%WhereIsWill> big axe for big boys
[2:27:43] <%CappuccinoGuil> Sidequests and collectibles
[2:27:48] <%Goldenwolf98> They come from quests and feathers
[2:27:56] <+okatokat_live> Ay pat how hype are you for baldurs gate 3?
[2:28:00] <Hellarussian> gotta collect those emeralds for the xp
[2:28:01] <harryboi1997> BIG DAMAGE
[2:28:13] <harryboi1997> I really like the music
[2:28:16] <%Laecerelius> With the guys who made Original Sin on the job I'm super looking forward to BG3
[2:28:29] <+okatokat_live> agreed
[2:28:40] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> It'd be nice my IP didn't flake out on its job every once in a while.
[2:28:41] <RyuuAoi> @harryboi1997 Very soothing in intense situations.

[2:29:21] <pswayde> Pat is becoming a pirate
[2:29:21] <Valdorick> Which, god damn, good on them, I know, but also hope, that they'll do the IP proud
[2:29:24] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> That does make me big excite for BG3
[2:29:37] <RyuuAoi> Is Pat playing too much tloz?
[2:29:43] <%Frostydough1> Pat is this game ok

[2:31:22] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> I wonder if BG3 will use D&D 5E, or that weird combo of AD&D and 3rd edition that it used back in the day.
[2:31:23] <Neo_Kaiser> I hope this game causes Pat to recreate the Nixon voice.
[2:31:27] <RyuuAoi> Did Pat eat yet?

I just had to put my cat down that I have had since I was a kid cause she got sick and had an ultrasound today and turned out to have really bad cancer and was in pain and I honestly don't know what to do without her cause we did everything together, she was my world and I was hers and I'm just so lost now and keep expecting her to walk into my room :(
[2:32:37] <%Laecerelius> the platforming doesn't seem bad in this game
[2:33:05] <%Laecerelius> I was right, those are corbs!
[2:33:10] <jtdobyns> Should we tell him to hit the bonfire near the entrance first?
[2:33:19] <%Goldenwolf98> She cares not for the giant enemy corb
[2:33:20] <Load_Complete> Or was I @Cthulos ?
[2:33:29] <harryboi1997> Woolie tricked me into doing blackface. he told me it was cool

[2:33:53] <%Cthulos> wat

[2:35:50] <+Raeiyn> that sums up my experience with ashen as well
[2:35:51] <RyuuAoi> BIG TOYS FOR BIG BOIS
[2:35:58] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> I'm sure you'll drop one of your online games and maybe come back to this
[2:36:00] <%takiyami> It has co-op right? Basically the appeal is co-op souls then?
[2:36:04] <Quantumsheep1> I mean, I had fun with it
[2:36:09] <RyuuAoi> Meh. We've all been there.
[2:36:09] <harryboi1997> I'm getting some Dark Souls DLC vibes
[2:36:12] <Quantumsheep1> It's very nice aesthetically
[2:36:13] <%Laecerelius> this game is all about the co-op
[2:36:23] <%Laecerelius> Gotta have a partner and you get an AI helper if you don't have a person to play with
[2:36:26] <%CalderGaming> ah
