[0:12:58] <%doc_ock_rokc> Google glass was a disaster and I was intrested in it
[0:12:59] <TheBlankAce> Stadia will exist for like 3 months then die immediatly
[0:12:59] <+MastodonSentry> super well
[0:13:00] <%ares92822> Google Plus and Glass are the only ones I rember
[0:13:01] <+Pookiedaexzile> Member the ENGAGE
[0:13:01] <%tigerfang86> Google Glass haHAA
[0:13:02] <%domokun124> google picasa
[0:13:04] <%Mr_Initials> hey google glass was cool though
[0:13:04] <%SirGO0SE> did google glass even make it past a fucking trailer
[0:13:06] <%SilvaChariot0133> Gubal what now?
[0:13:06] <%ElenaManetta> You CAN'T start a sentence with "Unfortunately, you won't be watching this stream next year" when I suffer from PTSD of thinking BEST FRIENDS (FINAL) was a joke
[0:13:06] <%Fadedblank247> i remember Google Fiber, and so do the other people here that never got back deposits
[0:13:07] <+Nymphonomicon> I don't concern myself with dead things as the dead cannot harm the living.
[0:13:08] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes. I use 2 of them....a little.
[0:13:08] <%ZizerX> Oh god the glass lmao
[0:13:08] <kadusb> super duper well
[0:13:09] <Angry_Ev1L> Imagine buying movies on netflix along with their sub price Kappa
[0:13:09] <+Gr33nCutl4ss> LUL LUL LUL LUL LUL
[0:13:09] <%doc_ock_rokc> Like it was way to expensive
[0:13:09] <+Darren716> Did Glass ever even get released?
[0:13:10] <%matrixManipulator> I use hangouts but I see your point.
[0:13:12] <%Shikari21> did Google glass even ever come out
[0:13:12] <%walternatorz> I remember one youtube channel.
[0:13:12] <critikal_bit> Is Google Fiber still a thing?
[0:13:12] <%Frost_Quill> We HAD to use Google+ if we wanted youtube accounts.
[0:13:13] <King_Wolf_Rigger> I think the Stadia is a car
[0:13:13] <%GohanEgret> @Ell1ot too expensive to lay their own line, I believe
[0:13:14] <%cvp5127> LUL
[0:13:14] <Tisaric> Hangouts gets like periods of actual support than years of nothing
[0:13:17] <%AgniBrandt> Google Glass is actually doing okay in some professional settings, I think.
[0:13:18] <%TDotGoat> I 'member
[0:13:18] <%tigerfang86> google glass was cool in theory but it was still lol
[0:13:19] <kadusb> yes I do
[0:13:20] <+Darren716> Fuck yeah...
[0:13:22] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Like, a shitty Russian car
[0:13:23] <NeroInfinite> yep
[0:13:24] <%kiiiirsten> I like Hangouts
[0:13:24] <hntronium> Yeah I remember that
[0:13:24] <TheViltsuZ> @AngriestPat How many games do you complete in a year on average, Pat?
[0:13:25] <Aydarkzero> fuck that shit
[0:13:26] <%SirGO0SE> hahahahha +1 to that bruh
[0:13:26] <%Kataguro> Yeah, that fucking sucked
[0:13:28] <+TheEdrem> The ones with enough internet to burn on stadia are not the ones cheap enough not to buy a console/gaming pc
[0:13:30] <redrins> I remember when I was partnered with any videos uploaded :^)
[0:13:31] <%doc_ock_rokc> Yes

[0:13:59] <%doc_ock_rokc> Its gonna do so well/s
[0:13:59] <%st4rrytea> yeah i have like three different youtube accounts on one email because of google plus
[0:14:00] <Goldenwolf98> LUL
[0:14:01] <%crimsonharvest> You have to be a massive mark to actually pay money to google as an end user
[0:14:01] <NeroInfinite> Stadia sounds like a disease
[0:14:02] <+Pookiedaexzile> Google also tracks what you type bitches
[0:14:03] <%NovaKnightmare> Google going really gross recently
[0:14:05] <Psyramics> WE won't have the bandwidth? How would you have bandwidth to both stream the game from Google and then stream the game to us?
[0:14:05] <%LouieRouie> Google Stadiums

[0:14:17] <%walternatorz> Waymo will cut customer support when someone is on the road
[0:14:17] <hntronium> Hey Pat remember Google Fiber
[0:14:17] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Careful, Google is listening to you. You might get demonitized.
[0:14:17] <Tisaric> Stadia confirmed Twitch killer
[0:14:18] <ScudmanSentinel> Stadia's just gonna kill any third world country's stream views
[0:14:19] <Don_Discovery> Pat did you see Wooloo?
[0:14:21] <$cureneckbeard> I read that Google promotes employees for building new products, but not for maintaining them, so they keep making shit and then dropping it
[0:14:21] <$valriot> @angriestpat Destiny looks great at least
[0:14:21] <%ElenaManetta> it's okay i'm stealing my neighbor's wifi
[0:14:22] <%ForgetfulUthanasiast> No sad
[0:14:23] <Angry_Ev1L> can google lobby for no data caps?
[0:14:23] <gigacanuck> for real chat, 1 solid hour of "Pat drinking Red Bull" ASMR, would you watch it?
[0:14:23] <TheViltsuZ> @AngriestPat How many games do you complete in a year on average, Pat?
[0:14:23] <%doc_ock_rokc> Stadia sounds like something you get from visiting san diago
[0:14:27] <kadusb> we still lur you though
[0:14:28] <17sevens> this news had made me so much more excited for stadia
[0:14:29] <%ares92822> Chat can just steal the bandwith
[0:14:29] <+Kavtech> Stadia will crush you you little man.
[0:14:31] <%theAncopro> google really out to kill independent channels
[0:14:32] <%domokun124> googlke shan rain fore from above
[0:14:32] <%SirGO0SE> but you will be the one with no bandwidth since you'll have a stadia on each floor of your house!
[0:14:35] <wix964> stadia sounds like a skin condition
[0:14:36] <starotter70> Can't wait for the defenders
[0:14:37] <Tisaric> It's going to fall on it's face so fucking hard
[0:14:37] <%cvp5127> stadia for evo lets go
[0:14:39] <%CJett92> I cant wait to not own any of my games!

[0:14:44] <%MagickBurritoh> It's a scam
[0:14:45] <kadusb> itll happen
[0:14:46] <deity_majora> EU lawsuit
[0:14:46] <%ElenaManetta> So just like an MMO
[0:14:48] <@commanderclaw> The EU and Australia will fuck them up
[0:14:49] <%AbnormalVoid> LUL
[0:14:50] <%arcaderabbit48> 18 is being generous
[0:14:52] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat 12 to 18
[0:14:52] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> No one except paid Google employees will buy games.
[0:14:53] <sileo_patronus> that's ambitious
[0:14:54] <Cptn_Turtle> Quick, give him MONEY
[0:14:54] <%SirGO0SE> thanks for the money SUCKERS
[0:14:55] <%NovaKnightmare> you know whats scary Pat? thats probably accurate @AngriestPat
[0:14:57] <%PlainSimpleTailor> PAT NO, CRAZY TALK
[0:14:58] <cerberuscarmine> XD
[0:14:58] <ryderbootz> you know what? just don't even bother with it, pretend it never even was ever here
[0:14:59] <+TheEdrem> As if Stadia is ever coming to Australia to begin with
[0:14:59] <%tigerfang86> MONEY
[0:15:01] <%tigerfang86> M O N E Y
[0:15:03] <%Frost_Quill> 18 seems a little generous.
[0:15:06] <%NovaKnightmare> like all this money wasted
[0:15:09] <%Kataguro> MARK II
[0:15:09] <cerberuscarmine> MARK 2
[0:15:09] <%supersugoisenpai1> Stadia kills the internet
[0:15:09] <%tigerfang86> THE MARK 2
[0:15:10] <kadusb> M
[0:15:13] <%blastazoid26> @AngriestPat Can you imagine Baldur's gate 3 being stadia exclusive?
[0:15:14] <%MagickBurritoh> Yeah
[0:15:14] <%tigerfang86> THE MARK 2 PAT
[0:15:15] <%NovaKnightmare> its like Anthem on a wider scale
[0:15:19] <%LtShuckle> DA MARK 2
[0:15:20] <TheViltsuZ> @AngriestPat How many games do you complete in a year on average, Pat?
[0:15:21] <%doc_ock_rokc> Its technically a war crime
[0:15:21] <hntronium> VERSION 2.0
[0:15:23] <%Dovahthing> Google is the personification of 'Stop making *insert trend here* happen, its not going to happen"
[0:15:26] <Goldenwolf98> Stadia plus Streaming would just kill your data LUL
[0:15:28] <%Niney_Who> But it's THE MARK TWO
[0:15:28] <%supersugoisenpai1> Your Yamato ship waifu lives again
[0:15:28] <cerberuscarmine> its a fuckin boat
[0:15:30] <%GohanEgret> @blastazoid26 it's not, at least that's why they're saying now
[0:15:32] <%doc_ock_rokc> Like a major International Warcrime
[0:15:33] <%ForgetfulUthanasiast> They give you a badge for adopting early like an obedient consumer though. A FUCKING BADGE
[0:15:34] <%GohanEgret> what*
[0:15:34] <cerberuscarmine> JUST SINK IT
[0:15:38] <b1gboss007> dont spoil yakuza in hat in time stream please :(
[0:15:39] <%SirGO0SE> but @AngriestPat ....its the MARK TWO
[0:15:40] <%ElenaManetta> We have to protect THE BOAAAAAT
[0:15:41] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Why did they even finish the dumb thing?
[0:15:42] <%Kataguro> It's just a pile of rusty shit metal. Just dismantle it, you dummies
[0:15:45] <%Frost_Quill> Pay WHY IS THE GAME FROZEN what?
[0:15:47] <+Ell1ot> Yakuza 6: The Baby
[0:15:47] <cerberuscarmine> it could have been a NUKE
[0:15:49] <%SirGO0SE> Mark T W O
[0:15:50] <Saltmeisterr> BUT IT THE MARK II
[0:15:51] <%FrustratedAF> a notebook with allegedlies
[0:15:52] <%theAncopro> could have been a mysterious USB
[0:15:52] <%Verd_254> it could have been metal gear
[0:15:52] <%SilvaChariot0133> Nuclear Launch Codes Kappa
[0:16:00] <Angry_Ev1L> It was literally gundam unicorn plot but even dumber LUL
[0:16:01] <+Pookiedaexzile> So how much money is google gonna charge us for this venture
[0:16:01] <critikal_bit> But the Mark TWO
[0:16:03] <kingra> MARK TWOOOO PAT!!!
[0:16:07] <King_Wolf_Rigger> But, muh Yamato
[0:16:07] <%supersugoisenpai1> It's the money, not the boat itself
[0:16:07] <%MagickBurritoh> It should've been metal gear
[0:16:08] <%SirGO0SE> @AngriestPat I dont think you fucking get it Pat
[0:16:10] <TheViltsuZ> @AngriestPat How many games do you complete in a year on average, Pat?
[0:16:11] <42nfl19> @AngriestPat if you replace the MARK 2 with anything, it would have been better. The main message was the mishandled government funds.
[0:16:12] <RiverBirch> Daidoji: But I want my fucking boat
[0:16:13] <%SirGO0SE> Mark 2.
[0:16:16] <grayjammer> But it's like the FIRST ONE.... BIUT ITS THE SECOND ONE

[0:16:27] <%ElenaManetta> oh no why did i tattoo "i did it" on my back
[0:16:28] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat Why would the Yakuza give up their blackmail mealticket
[0:16:29] <GoldeNOVA> But Pat... it's the Yamato MARK TWO!
[0:16:30] <redial_nick> it could been squid monster from watchman
[0:16:31] <%supersugoisenpai1> Can't blackmail the dude without the boat

[0:25:32] <%mayorrev> what happens if you do them all? @angriestpat
[0:25:33] <%Taisuru> Mines top right, maybe I moved it though
[0:25:38] <+TheEdrem> Maybe he wanted the game to be harder to have more fun
[0:25:40] <%supersugoisenpai1> Hey idiot, go get promoted
[0:25:40] <%Frost_Quill> Your base class doesn't stay at 30 if you switch to the upgrade though Pat. He MIGHT have just removed the soul crystal by accident.
[0:25:41] <gigacanuck> absolute madman
[0:25:42] <%cvp5127> nah
[0:25:42] <@mothmandraws> should I do my class quests?

[0:25:45] <$cureneckbeard> nyannPasu
[0:25:45] <%arcaderabbit48> @AngriestPat They should bar you from entering a Dungeon until you've done your class quest
[0:25:47] <+dyedeme> @mothmandraws Pat is yelling about people having fun wrong. Pretty much the usual
[0:25:47] <%kiiiirsten> This has been a PSA

[0:27:43] <%templar010> You are a hero Pat
[0:27:43] <Sabercry> do not enable him
[0:27:45] <%Frost_Quill> Sounds like either a bot or he was trying to power lvl solo? Could have come off of PotD grinding. But yeah that's shitty to do that to your rando party members.

[0:28:36] <+TheEdrem> Just imagine pat, trust system will let him play horribly without ever changing :P
[0:28:36] <%Kataguro> Now that's a bit much
[0:28:38] <%ElenaManetta> No, there is a special server for losers
[0:28:38] <Dr_Mooose> annnnd too far
[0:28:39] <+caffeinomancer> That's a mood, just had an asshole SAM tank in a levelling roulette
[0:28:39] <+MastodonSentry> i play shooters and i feel that way lol
[0:28:39] <StaticSunrise> you are 500% right
[0:28:40] <NickHatesSnow> LUL
[0:28:40] <starotter70> Yeah?
[0:28:40] <+Ell1ot> I think that's why I don't want to play MMO's
[0:28:40] <%Shikari21> That sounds great
[0:28:41] <%DigitalJoshie> I mean that's a bit much, but I get it
[0:28:42] <CandideCamera> just replace all the players with AI... and replace the online with offline... and play a single-player RPG forever and ever
[0:28:42] <%MagickBurritoh> That's too much
[0:28:42] <lloyddboy> Baddie Tax
[0:28:43] <NeroInfinite> PAt you'd bebanned too ya know
[0:28:45] <Daniel_Is_I> WoW has trials you have to do to do dungeons but they're really easy.
[0:28:45] <@mothmandraws> I didnt know chimeras gimick
[0:28:45] <%Kenori> jesus
[0:28:46] <%Faustgesicht> They have those. they're the Smith quests
[0:28:46] <Angry_Ev1L> Didn't kill O12S? WELLP you're banned
[0:28:46] <aimlesshealer> It switches your sub to Pony Island Adventure Online
[0:28:48] <@mothmandraws> and nearly killed team
[0:28:48] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat You can't ban yourself
[0:28:48] <hntronium> They could get sued for that
[0:28:49] <NoirePanzer> But Pat. How would you ever progress?
[0:28:52] <RiverBirch> Maaastery rank TRiiiiiaaaaaLlls
[0:28:52] <%Kenori> and what if you were banned because of that
[0:28:53] <gustavozxd> LUL @angriestpat payday 2 has mods where you autoban people from your match if they have less than X amount of hours
[0:28:54] <Tucker0603> no
[0:28:57] <%ThatOneGameTester> Sequential lvl up skips that force you to learn mechanics would be a decent stopgap measure
[0:28:59] <NoirePanzer> LUL
[0:28:59] <%supersugoisenpai1> Pat, stop, Crazy Talk Requiem will make it so!
[0:28:59] <%Afterman_> MonkaS
[0:29:00] <%cTAKU> Punish the weak
[0:29:01] <CalderGaming> like a more extreme version of mastery rank trials, yeah
[0:29:01] <AMajorTom> Pat - Larry David - There is no difference.
[0:29:04] <$valriot> @angriestpat You should be able to run the content youre currently running
[0:29:05] <zk_nails> Na, just auto-dump them into a server designated for bad players
[0:29:07] <+TreeeFOX> sbfpShido sbfpShido
[0:29:14] <deity_majora> WoW tried that for heroic dungeons... people bitched @AngriestPat
[0:29:18] <%thenameisirrelevant> Remember how they shut down the Family Guy MMO because the fanbase couldnt finish the first mission
[0:29:18] <Jetsfantasy> @mothmandraws That's my levelling experience. Though I'm up in the 60
[0:29:20] <%cvp5127> is ff14 a one time purchase or sub based?
[0:29:22] <DraxTD> Pat just wants to play FF online alone and this is his loophole!
[0:29:31] <%Jjrossman> FUCKIN LONG TIME
[0:29:32] <aimlesshealer> @deity_majora omg I totally forgot about that
[0:29:32] <Angry_Ev1L> But pat... on a server with only good players you'll be da bad player...
[0:29:33] <@mothmandraws> im lvl 39 atm
[0:29:35] <%ThatOneGameTester> @cvp5127 sub based and purchase
[0:29:36] <indig0bird> Sub based
[0:29:36] <NeroInfinite> There was a Family Guy MMO?
[0:29:38] <@mothmandraws> im higher than I should be
[0:29:41] <%Rngiddion> just like a awful SO an awful raid member makes you enjoy solitude more
[0:29:44] <jeffishype> That's actually an interesting idea : But like, applied to challenges that force you to learn how to do your classes job effectively before you can run a dungeon
[0:29:45] <%thelaxinator> The lvl 20 job quests are a skill check and easy o fail if you don’t kill dps and healers first
[0:29:49] <%mortalitas87> proving grounds
[0:29:52] <%Shikari21> Yeah that was back in MoP i think
[0:29:54] <aimlesshealer> It wasn't even hard!!!
[0:30:01] <gustavozxd> Elite Lord
[0:30:01] <+Pixel_Matt> The Proving Grounds
[0:30:02] <%Shikari21> They werent even hard LUL
[0:30:10] <@mothmandraws> solo UWU or be banned
[0:30:13] <ooblag> Nothing toxic about weeding out shitters LUL
[0:30:18] <%Tenkay> @AngriestPat in Warlords of Draenor they made you get at least Silver rank in proving grounds and people complained cause they couldnt do it
[0:30:19] <+Pixel_Matt> You need silver not gold
[0:30:20] <Jetsfantasy> Pat, you're making me want to boot up XIV now
[0:30:23] <%thenameisirrelevant> @neroinfinite Yes. No one could finish the finish the first mission because Family Guy fanbase apparently doesnt play MMOs
[0:30:24] <Monkeyweed21> NABRIALES IS A HO
[0:30:24] <TheViltsuZ> @AngriestPat How many games do you complete in a year on average, Pat?
[0:30:30] <NoirePanzer> Solo endgame content or PERISH

[0:42:17] <%Faustgesicht> @mercado94 tbf that's accurate
[0:42:18] <Monkeyweed21> Stadia is an early access lifestyle
[0:42:18] <%LtShuckle> HOO BOY
[0:42:19] <aimlesshealer> I would like to get off this ride, thank you
[0:42:19] <LevelClear> Just say no to Stadia
[0:42:19] <Valentinius_Anodyne> It's more of a collective dream I think
[0:42:20] <%HiroTSK5> Was google Stream the Early Access?

[0:42:21] <$KnivesEve> it is?
[0:42:22] <TheBlankAce> The free service does come later

[0:42:24] <%Frost_Quill> Fuck. I didn't even think of that.
[0:42:24] <Mr_Strut> It's technically not a console
[0:42:24] <King_Wolf_Rigger> I still think the Stadia is a car
[0:42:25] <CandideCamera> early access Flash games
[0:42:25] <TheViltsuZ> @AngriestPat How many games do you complete in a year on average, Pat??
[0:42:26] <%GohanEgret> in fairness, consoles have been early access since the 360
[0:42:30] <WanderingSwordsman> it is but a shitty one

[0:42:33] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> That sounds pure evil. So, yes. I expect Google to do that.
[0:42:33] <%MightyMaxT> I hope stadia fails super hard
[0:42:36] <gustavozxd> early access dumpster fire, you're there before the fire starts
[0:42:38] <%templar010> @AngriestPat You hear about D2 getting cross platform characters/saves?

[0:43:23] <%spiritofmojave> they're right, totally useful compared to the 14 SBFP reference video I used several years back
[0:43:24] <%brave_sj> I still think stadia sounds like some kind of obscure genital infections

[0:45:04] <%ArcanumMBD> ArcanumMBD subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months! Fate is dumb waifu bait. The stories are dumb, and the only redeeming factor is good animation and cool fights. Every time my friend convinces me to watch a new Fate anime I regret wasting my time on it.

[0:50:15] <%blastazoid26> sure
[0:50:19] <%spiritofmojave> Bloodstained looks real good assuming no delay again
[0:50:21] <%Kataguro> It was more during LPs
[0:50:26] <@mothmandraws> probably like 1-2 for me
[0:50:30] <%GarbageNirvana> Lemme guess, game hasn't started yet
[0:50:34] <%Frost_Quill> So the final boss of FFXIV is gonna be the light crystal right? That's totally where it's going, right?
[0:50:36] <%Kataguro> >Anime Onlys
[0:50:40] <+Promessa_EX> "waifu"
[0:50:41] <ChoculaUltra> "wah I hate the thing because I don't like it"
[0:50:42] <LokimenD> @AngriestPat what about that Yamato mk2? Kappa
[0:50:43] <%goose_attack_almanac> goose_attack_almanac subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 26 months, currently on a 16 month streak! It's Pat, It's Pat. He's the Pat.Hi Pat. I have a Series recommendation for you, that actually seems to be ending soon unlike the ASoIaF books. The Expanse is a Sci-Fi series
[0:50:44] <+talfurt> i got back into ffxiv the other day and finally made it out of post arr stuff and into hw its so much better
[0:50:46] <QaizerArt> @Prism_Wing i swear to goodness, didn't pat say he was gonna try to keep the donation readng to like a half hour
[0:50:47] <%goose_attack_almanac> FUCK
[0:50:49] <Monkeyweed21> Yeah Fate is mostly trash
[0:50:52] <+Promessa_EX> I think you mean husbando astoflo
[0:50:52] <%DigitalJoshie> fate is that hentai thing right?
[0:51:01] <%weissguard> LUL
[0:51:02] <%bluetocho13> there is only one good thing about Fate is Astolfo
[0:51:04] <King_Wolf_Rigger> STO ain't the worst thing ever, and the Fate anime also ain't the worst thing ever.
[0:51:06] <A_Traitor> I like boat waifus, that the only reason i gacha
[0:51:06] <Graywolf_the_45th> Fate GO? more like, it's fate to go and never get into this series
[0:51:09] <%MagickBurritoh> yes
[0:51:13] <StaticSunrise> warf ace
[0:51:13] <%brave_sj> @spiritofmojave They're already getting ready to ship copies to backers so looks like it's ready to go
[0:51:14] <%Kataguro> Only on the original release, and only due to that being used to sell it. They took the porn out later
[0:51:17] <%Mr_Initials> @LtShuckle wait are you for or against GBF
[0:51:22] <%spiritofmojave> @digitaljoshie you're not wrong really
[0:51:26] <%ArcanumMBD> Astolfo is the worst thing about Fate, and that's saying a lot. He's worse than do-nothing-gary-stu Sig
[0:51:32] <SpaceGuntank> warface is a knock off counter strike made by the crytek guys
[0:51:34] <%MightyMaxT> I just started Granblue and its....fine. Muting the voices has really helped.
[0:51:34] <ChoculaUltra> why do people act like you HAVE to spend money on FGO to somehow get into the Fate anime?
[0:51:39] <+reiju_22> will you watch them solo?
[0:51:41] <%NovaKnightmare> JUST LIKE e3
[0:51:42] <gigacanuck> so just to confirm, Fate is the thing where Japan went "King Arthur was a woman, no really he was, shut up"
[0:51:42] <%supersugoisenpai1> A scroll down Pat lane
[0:51:43] <%LegendGHT> apatHoldon
[0:51:43] <%GohanEgret> this is the least interested I've ever been in an E3
[0:51:44] <%Typhaeon> Your gamer license is revoked
[0:51:45] <%LtShuckle> @Mr_Initials I like the fighting game but not the mobile game
[0:51:45] <burntwing> Nothing else matters other then Cyberpunk 2077 to me personally
[0:51:47] <%weissguard> PogChamp
[0:51:47] <RupanSen> YAAAAY few videogames

[0:51:51] <Daniel_Is_I> E3E3E3
[0:51:52] <+Seitine> Fate is just an attempt at justifying turning history into hot fuckable people.

[1:06:47] <Mr_Strut> Isn't Baldur's Gate done?
[1:06:48] <+binkarus> as a fan of diablo II, should my pp be hard?
[1:06:48] <+TheSaintJohn> longest wait so far
[1:06:49] <%NovaKnightmare> would u want to see it be an Isometric classic RPG or something akin to KOTOR and mass Effect?
[1:06:51] <+faithless_zealot> Yeah, I'm stoked, it's a shame you won't be there since you'll be dead from Energy drink over-consumption
[1:06:53] <grayjammer> Yeyeye time for the Big Squidbois
[1:06:54] <RupanSen> Wasn't Beamdog developing it already?
[1:06:55] <%rumtumtugnutz> baldur's gate Forever
[1:06:57] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Baldur's Gate is the greatest series ever.
[1:06:59] <%oddslogic> pfff 5th edition rules. 2nd edition for life
[1:07:01] <Mr_Strut> I thought the story was finished
[1:07:02] <a_mad_dragon> yeah the end of BGII was kind of definitive
[1:07:03] <SpaceGuntank> that stadia trailer was SUPER fucked up though
[1:07:03] <+StrawberryPantsu> All hail out Lala overlords
[1:07:03] <$cureneckbeard> Like 200 years has passed in the Forgotten Realms timeline
[1:07:07] <dukenux> I prefer Larian over Beamdog
[1:07:08] <%spiritofmojave> least they weren't promising a 3 in the first place
[1:07:13] <dukenux> very much, thank you
[1:07:17] <Storm_Samurai> @SpaceGuntank why i didn't see it
[1:07:20] <hntronium> I don't think I even expected a Baldur's Gate 3 tbh
[1:07:20] <%Faustgesicht> ger jerb
[1:07:21] <Louie_Salmon> Isn't Baldur's gate without a mouse and keyboard going to be an unplayable nightmare? Or is there something I'm not seeing
[1:07:26] <RupanSen> @dukenux that's a given
[1:07:33] <aimlesshealer> @Louie_Salmon That's what I thought, too...
[1:07:35] <excedebuster> Omg, this is my first stream live ! I love you Pat! And chat! sakuraspSuki
[1:07:43] <EskimoSpy31> @AngriestPat should BG3 stay real time or move to turn based like Divinity?
[1:07:44] <Luvinsus> monkaS 👉 🔔
[1:07:51] <%NovaKnightmare> Thats a fucking time stop bell
[1:07:52] <TabaxDM> @AngriestPat should i play baldr's gate?
[1:07:53] <dukenux> also, already confirmed to come to Steam and GoG
[1:07:55] <ooblag> I know they want to use the big fancy new ruleset, but 4e was basically made for video games, and that we will never gewt one sucks
[1:07:56] <Thirtine> my god, its full of stars!
[1:07:56] <hntronium> Pat is going to play BG3 on a controller and nobody will stop him
[1:07:57] <gigacanuck> cosmic power
[1:07:57] <%doc_ock_rokc> @excedebuster Welcome to the madness!
[1:08:00] <dukenux> so no Epic worries, for now
[1:08:00] <Mr_Strut> Well that looks fuckin evil
[1:08:04] <%spiritofmojave> @louierouie I mean if it's on PS4 you can plug in both keyboard and mouse
[1:08:04] <%brave_sj> bai
[1:08:06] <a_mad_dragon> JUST BUY THEM
[1:08:08] <+talfurt> the sounds in this area remind me of psychonauts for some reason
[1:08:15] <VJdarkworld> @Frost_Quill this area lagged hard for me last year when i played it
[1:08:19] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @Louie_Salmon They made other games similar to BG that worked on the controller, so it really depends on if they go turn-based or real-time.
[1:08:27] <A_Traitor> @AngriestPat Look up

[1:25:47] <%AbnormalVoid> put the pill in his hair
[1:25:53] <+Nomicro4u> You should eat the Pills and show him how tasty it be
[1:25:54] <StaticSunrise> maybe elmo has been pretending this whole time
[1:25:54] <%rumtumtugnutz> kitty pills = bad candy.
[1:25:55] <%Edgy_Macaroon> that's instinct
[1:25:55] <+superkeaton> The cat instinct to make their owners lives difficult
[1:25:56] <Nordguy> Probably because of the shelter
[1:25:57] <$cureneckbeard> someone should invent cat pills made of like meat
[1:26:04] <Too_Much_Nukie> Cat does not care.
[1:26:06] <cerberuscarmine> XD
[1:26:08] <excedebuster> He’s cute that’s what counts
[1:26:10] <Sulliman34> ya tried catnip?
[1:26:12] <%DigitalJoshie> I think that's just instinct
[1:26:14] <+Nomicro4u> You gotta swaddle cat with blanket
[1:26:15] <qo_op> the pain is good for you
[1:26:19] <worldbrand> my name is kat and this is weird to listen to
[1:26:21] <deity_majora> Giving Cat pill is 2 person job
[1:26:21] <aimlesshealer> I had to crush my cat's pills and put them in tuna and butter
[1:26:25] <RupanSen> why do they even make pills for cat?
[1:26:30] <%deviljhojho94> a cat will gladly eat your corpse once you go 2 minutes without being alive
[1:26:32] <Admiral_PopnFresh> kill to no pill give bad

[1:26:37] <SparrowHW> finger in mouth, shove pill in, hold mouth closed
[1:26:39] <gigacanuck> have you tried gloves?
[1:26:40] <Thirtine> @AngriestPat you should try out the burrito method for that! swaddle the cat like a baby for pills
[1:26:44] <$Valdorick> !uptime
[1:26:44] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 26m.
[1:26:46] <Luvinsus> Just give him the pill with his hair, easy
[1:26:49] <ChoculaUltra> I heard they even have anti-depressants for pets
[1:26:50] <+superkeaton> rooThink
[1:26:50] <Dr_Mooose> well timed sling shot
[1:26:51] <EuropantLamprey> My cats never attacked me over pills, but boy were they stubborn

[1:27:01] <%Radregice_> wait what's weird about pills for cats
[1:27:04] <nerdblase> Kitty purrito.
[1:27:06] <hntronium> Cat can wriggle out of blankets really quick
[1:27:07] <excedebuster> Cat is sociopath kaiaS
[1:27:08] <worldbrand> tell the cat about the mk2
[1:27:10] <Mr_Strut> Crush pill. Sprinkle over food
[1:27:11] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> turn Elmo into a burrito kitteh.
[1:27:12] <%Edgy_Macaroon> same reason why there's a car leash
[1:27:15] <AMaidIndeed> yes! purrito!
[1:27:17] <%NovaKnightmare> disguise the pill as his own hair
[1:27:18] <%SirGO0SE> engage ELMO MK 2
[1:27:21] <Luvinsus> Why are you telling this like it's a greentext?
[1:27:21] <Admiral_PopnFresh> what I have think
[1:27:22] <cerberuscarmine> CRONCH
[1:27:24] <+BubbaRands> Just jam the pill in an orifice and say job well done Kappa
[1:27:25] <%connos_livereview> the most realistic part of chernobyl is the bit at the start where the cats owner dies and it doesnt give a fuck
[1:27:29] <%Radregice_> why is he talking like this
[1:27:31] <HeadsHeldHigh> put it in the nose
[1:27:32] <RupanSen> you gazelle punch them

[1:27:38] <+superkeaton> And then release hand grenade
[1:27:39] <%Radregice_> not that i'm complaining
[1:27:40] <Too_Much_Nukie> What you do is you grab the cat's jaw with one hand, pry mouth open, and then you stick the pill in their throat. The gag reflex will swallow it.
[1:27:43] <worldbrand> minitspeak is great
[1:27:44] <%JustAnotherMuffin> @AngriestPat Did you not have a pill injector?
[1:27:45] <%Kataguro> Do Minit yeah
[1:27:46] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> mad
[1:27:47] <%Faustgesicht> had to use pill injector on my ex's cat every night. It sucked
[1:27:50] <worldbrand> it's even better than baba is speak
[1:27:51] <SpaceGuntank> its for your own good!

[1:28:14] <hntronium> Injector?
[1:28:17] <%doc_ock_rokc> It works
[1:28:18] <%SirGO0SE> is it like a gun?!
[1:28:19] <Too_Much_Nukie> It's a nerf gun that shoots pill.

[1:28:44] <hntronium> WutFace Injector doesn't sound good

[1:36:28] <$Valdorick> I mean, you do get PAID to play the vidya gems
[1:36:30] <+cafefunk> Is any hobby really considered “valuable”
[1:36:31] <powerprotoman> you have a poor definition of tricking
[1:36:31] <aimlesshealer> Well maybe WE tricked YOU into playing games with our money!
[1:36:31] <rekinom> Cat's out of the bag now, everyone go home
[1:36:33] <+miguelrod777> we g8ve money so the monkey will dance
[1:36:34] <%HajimenoStream> ALL you do is play video games so that may be classified as a waste of time when you do it for non monetary gain
[1:36:35] <NickHatesSnow> Oh this fucking part
[1:36:36] <%Niney_Who> @AngriestPat Aren't you able to assign Badges to specific hats rather than 3 for all?
[1:36:36] <%Deekman> you didn't trick me I subbed to you and claim you as a dependant on my taxes
[1:36:37] <%HajimenoStream> sucks to suck
[1:36:37] <PortableBoredom> Joke's on you, I've never given a cent to Twitch ever.
[1:36:38] <%SirGO0SE> depends on the video game. good designers will make sure you walk away from the experience with more than a dopamine burst in the moment
[1:36:38] <sjotyme86> I think I'm going through a phase where I don't care to play games and find them boring. I'm scared
[1:36:39] <$El_Desperad0> That's cause we're the little piggies

[1:41:28] <$Valdorick> Do you think Devolver will tell us when Metal Wolf Chaos XD gets released this year...
[1:41:29] <+bellicoseweeb> Microsoft, but Nintendo or Square has a shot. Also, Devolver is funny, but they don't fucking announce anything
[1:41:30] <hntronium> Its totally fair when any of the others can't compare, THEY COULD IF THEY TRIED

[1:52:11] <Tucker0603> ?

[1:52:17] <+StrawberryPantsu> WAR best DPS/Tank
[1:52:21] <Sulliman34> we're getting some good shit in shadowbringers tbh
[1:52:22] <%Reco08> Play Paladin
[1:52:23] <$El_Desperad0> Monk looks sick tho
[1:52:24] <+caffeinomancer> Levelling DRK now in anticipation for tanking changes
[1:52:25] <+sam_groove> I'm trying to level to cap in time for it, but i also just don't know the efficient way to do so ll
[1:52:26] <Sulliman34> FINALLY AN AOE ROTATION
[1:52:28] <%SirGO0SE> BOOYA
[1:52:29] <Tisaric> Hat Kid's little war cries are so cute
[1:52:33] <+TestAnon> How's bard looking in shadowbringers?
[1:52:34] <Sulliman34> but theyre getting rid of purification for some UNGODLY REASON
[1:52:35] <+StrawberryPantsu> PLD is ResidentSleeper
[1:52:36] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@doc_ock_rokc) (warning)
[1:52:36] <Sloavon> is Black Mage worth playing? I'm a thaumaturge right now
[1:52:39] <$cureneckbeard> OUYA
[1:52:44] <%BillyMaze> Tim Pidgeon
[1:52:47] <%D33TR> for leveling you want to do your daily roulettes, main scenario, and allegiance raid
[1:52:47] <%spiritofmojave> funny how SB a heavily Monk expansion gave it no real new mechanics
[1:52:47] <%Frost_Quill> @AngriestPat I'm sorry Pat, I can't stand two-handed swords so I have to play Paladin instead of Dark Knight.
[1:52:49] <+Taglog7> play Free Bird Kappa
[1:52:51] <%tigerfang86> cause it's so CHILL
[1:52:52] <Saltmeisterr> WOOMY
[1:52:53] <%SirGO0SE> you get the relax on
[1:52:54] <+dawsfloss> teatheBlank
[1:52:54] <Monkeyweed21> Don't listen to Pat, BLM and MNK are Rad
[1:52:54] <%D33TR> if you dont have quests to do still for main story
[1:52:55] <SpaceGuntank> fuckin' NERDS
[1:52:55] <Nero9341> @AngriestPat you equip stickers on the umbrella to make her say other things
[1:52:56] <Jfrooz> im super hype over ninja and dancer
[1:52:57] <%GarbageNirvana> It's the big hotness
[1:52:58] <transporterthesequel> No play free bird tho
[1:52:58] <%Faustgesicht> it brings out joy
[1:52:59] <$DarkKnightGrave> Cyborg was Hat Kid's favorite titan.
[1:53:01] <Louie_Salmon> And also because it's like half your life
[1:53:01] <%LtShuckle> because hat in time is an mmo
[1:53:01] <+sourceofall> how about that dragoon getting that sixth hit combo
[1:53:01] <Tucker0603> yep, 14 nerd here
[1:53:01] <Twerknadooo> PLD is the hardest of all the tanks, but doesn't feel anywhere NEAR as rewarding.
[1:53:02] <%Frost_Quill> Because both games are chill.
[1:53:02] <%Wonderbot3000> play Blm
[1:53:03] <ChoculaUltra> because of the Jumping Events in the Golden Saucer maybe?
[1:53:08] <$El_Desperad0> @AngriestPat I started ff14 this month and loving it. WHAT THE FUCK is up with Blue Mage?
[1:53:09] <%arcaderabbit48> Because its what you ACTUALLY want to be playing
[1:53:11] <el_phthalo> Glad I'm not the only one who hears her say Ouya.
[1:53:14] <+metalsiren31> PLD looks amazing in ShB. Gonna main DRK and GNB but man it's tempting to triple dip
[1:53:14] <%Nobrev> I love how ffxiv has taken over the discord
[1:53:14] <King_Wolf_Rigger> ugh, I hate that reasoning
[1:53:15] <%GarbageNirvana> oo chil

[1:53:39] <+talfurt> spite is the best motivator
[1:53:40] <+TestAnon> I guess pat just doesn't like FFiV that much
[1:53:40] <%Reco08> Paladin just has the visual flavor I like.
[1:53:41] <+DesertOfSand> I'm considering playing FF14 specifically for just the mahjong. Good idea or nah?
[1:53:41] <%brave_sj> <3
[1:53:44] <+Taglog7> KappaPride
[1:53:44] <+sam_groove> How exactly do you go about leveling like crazy @AngriestPat ?
[1:53:44] <%puhff> Ew why?
[1:53:45] <%Frost_Quill> Dark Knight feels like it should have been a melee DPS.
[1:53:46] <Dr_Mooose> rude
[1:53:47] <Angry_Ev1L> @Sloavon if you're alright with never being wanted by any raiding group ever then sure.
[1:53:47] <%tigerfang86> happy pride month

[1:54:09] <+skylerpilot> @LouieRouie because SAM is a DPS
[1:54:10] <$DarkKnightGrave> Pat hates the gay confirmed.
[1:54:11] <%doc_ock_rokc> Look at that absolute unit boss we gonna fight
[1:54:11] <lilo52> Trans rights
[1:54:12] <%Reco08> Dark Knight just isn't my favorite. Too much black and red
[1:54:15] <Monkeyweed21> I'd rather heal a DPS WAR
[1:54:16] <ScrapSentinel> Why is hunting horn so underutilized in MHW, @AngriestPat ?
[1:54:19] <laserbeaming> Levelimum Classes
[1:54:20] <%puhff> Pat hates the gays, confirmed
[1:54:24] <BobaFetish2124> anti gay pat
[1:54:24] <+StrawberryPantsu> DRK is boring leveling
[1:54:30] <Tucker0603> THM is a slog though @angriestpat
[1:54:31] <%NovaKnightmare> TERF Pat
[1:54:35] <TioXyco> besides DRK, what other class/job you liked, @AngriestPat ?
[1:54:36] <californaya> GET PECKED

[1:54:39] <%GeneralSCPatton> Is time stop the counter for those things?
[1:54:40] <%Faustgesicht> what's your rapid level strat, pat?
[1:54:45] <+SolverCODO> trans rights and blood rites, that's what i say

[1:54:57] <+TheEdrem> You just got bullied
[1:55:02] <el_phthalo> So is it even possible to play XIV solo?
[1:55:07] <$Valdorick> Streamer Privilege.
[1:55:08] <%tigerfang86> IM PAT
[1:55:09] <artoflec> i didnt have timestop when i chose to do this part lol
[1:55:11] <%BillyMaze> "my name is Pat Boivin and I hate the gays"
[1:55:15] <%Frost_Quill> PotD up to 30 then do dungeons.
[1:55:17] <%tigerfang86> I'm an INFLUENCER guys
[1:55:17] <%arcaderabbit48> Hey, quesiton for the chat. Does Ninja get better? Cause its Mudra feel awkward to use

[1:55:27] <lilo52> You wasted all the hearts
[1:55:27] <%Kataguro> The clout
[1:55:28] <vonmaultke> "anymore"
[1:55:30] <Twerknadooo> @AngriestPat I asked when you were in the spooky land in this game, but what do you think of Hrothgar now that we know everything?"
[1:55:31] <hntronium> Thats big scum
[1:55:31] <%NovaKnightmare> Exposure leveling
[1:55:34] <Rhinoprotoss> barely
[1:55:41] <%puhff> Anymore lol
[1:55:53] <+metalsiren31> Just do squadron missions if you have them unlocked
[1:55:54] <%rumtumtugnutz> 1-50 is largely trivial.
[1:56:04] <%Ilpala> just level with mogtome dungeons
[1:56:07] <+dawsfloss> play eso u nurrrd
[1:56:09] <%Ilpala> gotta get them mogtomes
[1:56:10] <NickHatesSnow> missed a secret
[1:56:12] <%D33TR> im glad ff14 is super popular lately, but leveling roulettes have been miserable lately. nothing like getting stone vigil and your tank is still a gladiator wearing lvl 1 on the entire right side
[1:56:14] <cylish> I just do palace of the dead
[1:56:21] <切捨御免> stop doing the HW beast tribes when you hit 60 though
[1:56:23] <r_Foeburden87> @AngriestPat Remind them to do the lv15 Hall of the Novice for free lv15 gear and xp ring
[1:56:29] <tsuchi7> how do I level a tank if I have tank anxiety
[1:56:29] <%Faustgesicht> Ok, thanks! White mage is at 15. Time for dungeons
[1:56:31] <%Reco08> If you liked Ninja you light like Dragoon. I mean you'll be made fun of but it's fun
[1:56:32] <%rumtumtugnutz> I think I hit 50 in 3 days the first time.
[1:56:33] <$Valdorick> This is all the wrong answer, clearly, you give Square money Kappa
[1:56:33] <切捨御免> they only give 10k exp
[1:56:41] <+StrawberryPantsu> Pre-Order ShB for another EXP earing
[1:56:45] <%Frost_Quill> I lvld WHM to 50 in like two days.
[1:56:50] <+skylerpilot> @tsuchi7 maybe don't?
[1:56:54] <+lucaflow> You can power level 15-50 with POTD but you'll want to die
[1:57:20] <Twerknadooo> Hardest thing to level PERIOD? Casters.
[1:57:24] <%Ascethetic> Ascethetic subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 26 months! hey Pat, after I finish WHM,Im either going to do WAR or SAM, which do you think? Also, i forgot how to play WAR, can you give tips?
[1:57:30] <%Frost_Quill> You're making fun of it, but that little hop in with the ice hat is VITAL for some Death Wish missions. I'm not even kidding.
[1:57:33] <r_Foeburden87> Casters not named RDM
[1:57:34] <%tigerfang86> Potaters
[1:57:37] <$Valdorick> Casters - Friendless - hard mode.
[1:57:40] <切捨御免> Have you been getting your mogtomes?
[1:57:40] <%tigerfang86> LMAO
[1:57:41] <%aishman> So where is Eye Patch Wolf? Hanging out with Woolie?
[1:57:44] <MrDonTacos_> LUL
[1:57:47] <%NovaKnightmare> he ate like 40 potatoes on stream the other night
[1:57:49] <+caffeinomancer> BLM yes, but SMN you can just level SCH and get for free
[1:57:50] <$CarlosEoM> the old irish dilema
[1:57:51] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Nothing like a good potato suck
[1:57:51] <starotter70> Did he offer you some?
[1:57:52] <%Faustgesicht> EyePatch wolf is Lalafel Scum, got it
[1:57:54] <%Kataguro> EPW X Sasha is my OTP
[1:57:56] <rekinom> Also remember that leveling is supposed to be fun, so don't do shit if you're not enjoying it, try something else
[1:57:58] <%supersugoisenpai1> Don't you ever just suck on a potato
[1:57:58] <%dalmek> EyepatchWolf VORES LALAFELLS?
[1:57:59] <%kiiiirsten> Why you do that...
[1:58:00] <%puhff> Big potate succ
[1:58:01] <Hazlet95> but pat a lot of irish people left home without it
[1:58:01] <+skylerpilot> @tsuchi7 alternatively look up every strat and video guide for each dungeon, trial, etc. before doing any of them for the first time
[1:58:02] <Monkeyweed21> Eyepatch Wolf LOVES LALAFELLS
[1:58:02] <Dr_Mooose> safety potato
[1:58:04] <TioXyco> we talking about food or lalafels?
[1:58:05] <%cherubs_anonymous> He's making Woolie watch terrible anime
[1:58:08] <+Javaa01> Important tip for Death Wish: The Ice Hat activation doesn't count as a jump
[1:58:08] <McAngrimStein> how many potatoes does it take to kill the irish?
[1:58:09] <%Reco08> I just want Gunbreaker to be good.
[1:58:11] <Mr_Strut> Is that why you're too afraid to face him in 3rd strike?
[1:58:12] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat so you're telling me SEW plays Lalafel? rooScared
[1:58:15] <%MajorCrasher> there's nothing wrong with liking loli- I mean lalafells
[1:58:25] <hntronium> So you want his potatoes in you?
[1:58:29] <%GeneralSCPatton> @mcangrimstein NONE
[1:58:33] <%Afterman_> uhhhhhh @MajorCrasher
[1:58:34] <$cureneckbeard> The last time the Irish gave the English food there was a famine
[1:58:34] <gunzerkingdunce> you didn't offer him poutine?

[1:58:37] <%kiiiirsten> apatHoldon
[1:58:45] <%Frost_Quill> @AngriestPat Well Pat, did you offer HIM some of your maple syrup?
[1:58:47] <nobody12349> Pat wanted to recreate The Lady and the Tramp with a potato
[1:58:48] <+lucaflow> Gunbreaker looks pretty decent
[1:58:49] <+skylerpilot> @AngriestPat "Sucking on them Potatoes" doesn't sound right with the context of being said right after talking about FF14.
[1:58:50] <transporterthesequel> It's just a DPS class
[1:58:51] <切捨御免> gunbreaker is shaping up to not be good if the skill potency leaks are correct
[1:58:53] <ChoculaUltra> are Fridays the designated XIV days?
[1:58:57] <%tigerfang86> the gunblade is the COOLEST WEAPON don't @ me
[1:59:03] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Poutine is basically potato-plus

[1:59:24] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat in the US it's national donat day tomorrow. Does Canada have a national bagel day? rooThink
[1:59:25] <+metalsiren31> GNB only needs slight tweaks to bring its DPS in line with the other tanks which are also all just prelim numbers anyway
[1:59:31] <%Frost_Quill> @scrumdrew Tataru.
[1:59:32] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat Don't take him to one of those strip bagel places by mistake

[2:04:06] <%tigerfang86> dude
[2:04:08] <SpaceGuntank> we need to do some food research up in here
[2:04:09] <laserbeaming> I'm pretty sure the Incas cultivated potatoes in their Terraces
[2:04:10] <Sheepeze> yea alot of foods were brought to europe to enrich thier diets
[2:04:11] <%spiritofmojave> didn't the Brits import bad potats to Ireland because they're shitters?

[2:04:37] <+Javaa01> Go to the platforms you were just looking at

[2:05:21] <%rumtumtugnutz> bagels are Jewish and a lot of Jews came from Poland
[2:05:22] <dukenux> Bagels where invented in Poland, but poles have their own version of a bagel.
[2:05:26] <%SirGO0SE> mk...2...?
[2:05:28] <%Reco08> I mean, something being poison has not stopped many people before.
[2:05:28] <+DesertOfSand> Bagels are fucking weird. Like lemme just take this dough and BOIL IT? And it's DELICIOUS? Crazy.
[2:05:29] <nesalzer> Bagels are great now I want one.

[2:06:09] <%D33TR> i thought a bagel was just a bagel until i tried a montreal one
[2:06:12] <Jetsfantasy> It's just cause you got bagel holy water on tap

[2:06:38] <King_Wolf_Rigger> As a former New Yorker, I can say that Chicago does make a good pizza.
[2:06:39] <%kiiiirsten> nobody here likes deep dish wow
[2:06:41] <%NDHCemployee> Deep dish is okay
[2:06:42] <$humbelpie> @AngriestPat Boston makes some really good Poutine

[2:06:45] <%Dagman72> Chicago pizza = heaven

[2:06:46] <%Frost_Quill> See that blue painted wood? The path is near there.
[2:06:50] <King_Wolf_Rigger> And that rivalry is WEIRD
[2:06:50] <%TheSniperJoe> NO, NO GOD DAMNIT
[2:06:51] <Monkeyweed21> It's a fusion

[2:06:51] <+Javaa01> Climb up the blue plank and turn around

[2:06:56] <%terminallyCapriciousz> flavor*
[2:06:56] <%Dagman72> apatCrazyhead
[2:06:56] <geosspone> deep dish is soup
[2:06:57] <+ahegotrigger> Lasagna is better than pizza anyways
[2:06:58] <Buzzard42> yes that's correct
[2:06:59] <%Kenori> depends on the deep dish
[2:06:59] <RupanSen> isn't it like a fucking pie? WutFace
[2:06:59] <a_mad_dragon> deep dish is a fucking casserole
[2:07:00] <Mogel56> Fair warning most upstate NY bagels are bad
[2:07:00] <%supersugoisenpai1> Deep dish master race
[2:07:02] <$hatesdps> man when i was in 8th grade i lost my shit when i found out polish people were called poles
[2:07:02] <%around_40_jobbers> It's like a delicios bread cake with cheese and toppings
[2:07:03] <%SirGO0SE> you have to eat it WITH A FUCKING FORK
[2:07:03] <Louie_Salmon> Well without the pasta
[2:07:04] <%Kenori> its like a one-layer lasagna
[2:07:09] <%SirGO0SE> AGREED
[2:07:10] <HyperBomb21> Pie > Cake
[2:07:10] <dukenux> Because one is a pizza, and the other isn't
[2:07:11] <buffmurffy> pie is better than cake
[2:07:13] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Deep Dish is great, but Chicago style is just a casserole in crust
[2:07:13] <Finchit> they are the same tho
[2:07:13] <gigacanuck> that's exactly it
[2:07:13] <$cureneckbeard> Fish and chips is thought to have originated as a Jewish food too.
[2:07:13] <%D33TR> deep dish is pizza cake
[2:07:14] <PrinceOfEden> Cale > Pie
[2:07:14] <%ArcanumMBD> Deep dish pizza is a literal pizza pie. It's good, and in no way comparable to thinner crusted pizza
[2:07:15] <Liquid_Dio> Answer is Cake
[2:07:15] <King_Wolf_Rigger> very agree
[2:07:17] <+beigesamurai> Deep dish is a casserole, not pizza
[2:07:17] <Madbearv> Pat, MTing is the best
[2:07:17] <+Taglog7> waffles>
[2:07:17] <Finchit> cake = pie
[2:07:17] <%GeneralSCPatton> Who loves St. Louis style pizza? Can't get enough of that provel!
[2:07:18] <HenCereal> New Haven style pizza is #1
[2:07:19] <%Dead_Pal_VeeGeeZee> cake is superior
[2:07:19] <Momiziinubashiri> i mean cake is better then pie so its not really an argument
[2:07:20] <mar_krow> Pie
[2:07:23] <%Deekman> is a pancake a cake?
[2:07:24] <$cureneckbeard> MUFFIN DENIER
[2:07:25] <DatAsuna> It's like arguing if MUFFINS ARE BREAD
[2:07:27] <geosspone> all foods are either soups or sandwiches. chicago/deep dish pizza is soup. new york/thin crust is a sandwich
[2:07:27] <RiverBirch> But it is two deserts
[2:07:28] <%Rafferty3231> Deep dish is best pizza, you savages
[2:07:28] <NickHatesSnow> Cake + Pie is the best solution
[2:07:29] <cerberuscarmine> but what is cheese cake?
[2:07:30] <%Frost_Quill> Didn't you, Woolie, Matt, and Liam have a HUGE argument over this?
[2:07:31] <%TeraMercier> Neither is superior. They both have different appeals to different sensibilities
[2:07:31] <cowardlord> is a muffin a cake?
[2:07:31] <+skylerpilot> @AngriestPat that the opposite of what you were just saying though. "poland invited it but can't make a good one" "chicago invented it so it must be the best"
[2:07:31] <+Someitalian123> As someone with a straight off the boat italian family I always thought the argument was stupid
[2:07:32] <McAngrimStein> Cheesecake is a pie
[2:07:33] <%Reco08> Have you ever had neapolitan pizza
[2:07:35] <Rhinoprotoss> Muffins are bread?
[2:07:36] <pochiyeah> my ass is bigger than urs @AngriestPat
[2:07:37] <%Nobrev> pies are easily superior to cakes
[2:07:38] <%Reco08> It is cash
[2:07:39] <deity_majora> Pie is better... more variety including pizza pie
[2:07:39] <Monkeyweed21> Go up pat
[2:07:39] <mar_krow> Best is cheesecake
[2:07:39] <Ris_Eltrut> Pie is sooooo much better than cake
[2:07:40] <%SirGO0SE> As a born and bred NYer, I propose Chicago change the name of their shitty saucey meat pies to Zippa.
[2:07:41] <+Taglog7> NOT MY SKY CAKE
[2:07:41] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Pancake is a sweetbread
[2:07:44] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @Deekman Pancakes are a flatbread
[2:07:45] <%Kataguro> It's a pie
[2:07:46] <%tigerfang86> it's a cheese
[2:07:47] <%docpepperphd> muffingate
[2:07:48] <abakkus> a pancake is a pancake
[2:07:48] <%Niney_Who> No Cheesecake is a Pie
[2:07:49] <%Deekman> is a crepe a pancake?
[2:07:50] <%Nobrev> cheesecake is a cheese based pie
[2:07:52] <+LucentWulf> @AngriestPat the bug mask lets you jump on those ethereal platforms
[2:07:54] <el_phthalo> It's funny watching people argue cake versus pie when donuts are better.

[2:28:21] <$cureneckbeard> pull themselves out of their ass with their gamecube handle
[2:28:23] <%SirGO0SE> not acknowledging the burn makes the burn sizzle
[2:28:25] <$Valdorick> Have siblings, can confirm, that is proper etiquette there.
[2:28:26] <%ItsRatman> Pull that trophy out of your ass, and give it right to 'em.

[2:28:32] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Only cowards refuse to acknowledge when they get dunked on
[2:28:33] <%terminallyCapriciousz> Anytime I do that, Pat, the guy who did the burn always gets pissed *at* me for not just quietly taking it.

[2:33:07] <%HeyBoston> stop watching this stream right now and go watch that video

[2:40:03] <@lewdskeletor13> I actually did CBT for my anxiety when I saw a counselor. It worked for me
[2:40:04] <Jetsfantasy> NotLikeThis
[2:40:05] <Amedamaneku> and then they slap your dick
[2:40:08] <%NovaKnightmare> we're all children because we're not thinking of cognitve behavrioal therapy when u acronymed it
[2:40:09] <%Taglog7> @Bad1uck
[2:40:15] <%ElenaManetta> The process breaks down when you believe "But that IS realistic"
[2:40:16] <buffmurffy> sounds like a pain in the ass. i'll just be crazy
[2:40:21] <CopperTucker> @lewdskeletor13 Same here! It's actually super helpful for me

[2:40:35] <%MajorCrasher> what if my fears are already realistic?
[2:40:36] <Meta_Four> It's just like Dark Souls!

[2:40:37] <@lewdskeletor13> @coppertucker I’m glad!
[2:40:41] <reonome> @lewdskeletor13 hot
[2:40:43] <Monkeyweed21> pat no
[2:40:45] <%TeraMercier> It's about paying attention to the way you're thinking and what it does to you
[2:40:46] <%Farples> Pat...
[2:40:47] <Darthkitten_Prime> pat, you don't have to start over
[2:40:47] <Meta_Four> Pat use the shortcut!

[2:40:50] <%Farples> What are you doing....
[2:40:52] <$DarkKnightGrave> So then I put my balls in a vice to cure anxiety? Got it.

[2:41:05] <%Kenori> sorry to a therapist not work, its not work time
[2:41:12] <Rhinoprotoss> But how does that make you feel Pat?
[2:41:15] <@lewdskeletor13> I like when Pat talks psychology
[2:41:19] <excedebuster> What is cbt?
[2:41:19] <%Hibiki_Kuze> Hibiki_Kuze subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! Pat, you and Wooly have made me laugh more than any other being on this planet!
[2:41:20] <+111111sagas111111> I never found it particularly effective. It's basically telling yourself over and over again that feeling this way in response to this doesn't make sense but I know it doesn't make sense to feel this way. Knowing that it is absurd doesn't make it any less real
[2:41:33] <+Sycada> Talk psychology to me, Daddy
[2:41:35] <very_ap3> Pat what got you into psychology? As a crazy person it is definitely an interesting topic.
[2:41:35] <%connos_livereview> pathways are reinforced by thinking that same thing over and over
[2:41:41] <%HeyBoston> I'm sad now
[2:41:41] <BobaFetish2124> Sounds pointless
[2:41:50] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Many things don't have a cure
[2:41:50] <%SirGO0SE> Dr. Boivin you're so sexy with your labcoat on
[2:41:53] <Monkeyweed21> pat shortcut
[2:41:54] <%NovaKnightmare> does panic disorders have a cure?
[2:41:55] <%connos_livereview> i heard that from folk
[2:41:55] <laserbeaming> I don't think most mental disorders have cures
[2:41:57] <@lewdskeletor13> It helped my anxiety, but I needed actually meds for depression
[2:42:00] <%LtShuckle> apatGoblin
[2:42:04] <Amedamaneku> id say a lot of mental issues don't have "cures"
[2:42:04] <%TeraMercier> Just paying attention to the absurd thing isn't that effective unless you have something to replace it with

[2:42:42] <Bad1uck> CBT helped me immensely with anxiety and depression
[2:42:47] <XxbkgamerxX> the cure for OCD is for everything to be done correctly
[2:42:48] <+Zombiemowlcher> what a thing to join in on
[2:42:48] <+tearknack> @AngriestPat whats you opinion Goblin Slayer kappa

[2:42:59] <%tigerfang86> Gobbolins
[2:42:59] <%snow_bush> BURN THE HOUSE DOWN
[2:43:01] <%TeraMercier> It's more just that bringing up OCD is a topical reminder for someone who thinks about their actions with those terms
[2:43:08] <@lewdskeletor13> Have you used CBT for your ocd?
[2:43:10] <ReiDuran> ullillillia
[2:43:11] <$Valdorick> Its fine, its just ants, not like its spiders
[2:43:14] <+phantom_creep> i write stuff down that i cant stop thinking about for some reason having a physical copy of my thoughts helps my ocd
[2:43:15] <@commanderclaw> Wash your hands until they bleed is the rough one
[2:43:15] <RupanSen> goblins is the proper medical term
[2:43:17] <biomegabear> OCD doesnt help you find thing other people cant?
[2:43:21] <%crimsonharvest> I've been on antipsychotics because i've got paranoid psychosis
[2:43:23] <King_Wolf_Rigger> I wish meds worked. Glad it works for others though.
[2:43:31] <Monkeyweed21> Pat do you reccomend CBT?
[2:43:37] <katocrimson> walt disney was an OCD. He was known to wash his hands 40 times a day
[2:43:41] <%crimsonharvest> this isnt a bit its actually disabling
[2:43:41] <%NovaKnightmare> I dont need to punch small children to feel good about myself!
[2:43:45] <$DarkKnightGrave> Don't touch your nose.
[2:43:49] <ScrapSentinel> nothing wrong with a clean controller, pat is right here
[2:43:53] <+PRshadow172> Hey Pat you ever Nutted so hard you crack your back? calebEZ
[2:43:59] <Monkeyweed21> just say you recommend CBT
[2:44:06] <+tearknack> that sounds
[2:44:06] <rexbananas> is hoarding ocd?
[2:44:08] <%LouieRouie> Go outside
[2:44:10] <%HeyBoston> yeah but you're our dumb guy
[2:44:11] <%rumtumtugnutz> how does one recommend OCD
[2:44:11] <+tearknack> painful
[2:44:16] <Monkeyweed21> We need the sound clip
[2:44:18] <r_Foeburden87> D I S C L A I M E r gonn adisclaimm
[2:44:18] <%TeraMercier> OCD actually contains a moderately broad range of behavior, someone who says they have OCD but doesn't have a proper idea of what their ticks or habits are is misinformed about the condition
[2:44:21] <%crimsonharvest> cognitive behavioral therapy helped me not kill myself
[2:44:23] <@lewdskeletor13> People want a sound clip of you saying you recommend CBT
[2:44:23] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> they just want you to say you endorse cock and ball torture, Pat.
[2:44:24] <+Kavtech> @rumtumtugnutz No, CBT.
[2:44:28] <%rumtumtugnutz> I was not paying attention.
[2:44:28] <%SirGO0SE> back cracking nuts
[2:44:29] <@commanderclaw> "I'm not a doctor, but I do play one on Twitch"
[2:44:40] <Daniel_Is_I> Now watch as Pat ignores the shortcut he opened
[2:44:43] <%SirGO0SE> @commanderclaw LUL
[2:44:43] <very_ap3> keep talking psychology dude. ive been nuts lately and it helps to hear about this
[2:44:48] <+phantom_creep> the shitty thing about ocd is we know our thoughts dont make any sense but you haft to appease them anyway
[2:44:54] <%TeraMercier> Does Pat not know how to do things right the first time?

[2:45:31] <Daniel_Is_I> BLIND AS A BAT THIS MAN
[2:45:32] <%LouieRouie> It opened when you rang the bell

[2:45:40] <very_ap3> pat what got you into psychology
[2:45:42] <%doc_ock_rokc> Blind spiderman!

[2:45:53] <r_Foeburden87> Yo anyone know the PSA Discord for the data center?
[2:45:59] <+Doctor_Scoots> Maybe its a puzzle you need to come back with Time stop rooCult
[2:46:03] <%TeraMercier> Yeah, Pat, how did you get interested in Psychology pre university?
[2:46:07] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> time stop makes shit easier
[2:46:10] <@lewdskeletor13> @rhinoprotoss No, but she does have dibs on his skeleton
[2:46:11] <Tisaric> This level alone was more fun of a platforming section than anything in Odyssey for me
[2:46:17] <+111111sagas111111> well that scared the shit out of me
[2:46:23] <Kghaleon> this world is so forgettable I can't remember who the boss was
[2:46:32] <%Hibiki_Kuze> having OCD and seeing an unorganized inventory box can really grind your gears
[2:46:35] <%TeraMercier> There's just like, straight up more things happening in this game than Mario O
[2:46:35] <sponsoredviewer910> LUL
[2:46:40] <biomegabear> I like Pat made OCD be like 6th sense for problems like ants in the walls
[2:46:41] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> I don't think there wasa n actual boss @Kghaleon
[2:46:42] <SparrowHW> if only there were a hat that could make these jumps trivial
[2:46:43] <Tisaric> there's not really a boss on this one
[2:46:50] <+tearknack> @AngriestPat how far in the gme would you say you are? ive seen Hat in Time before but it seemed really bland; however you seem to have cool movement shit
[2:46:52] <%MelBrooksKA> Is agorophobia when you're terrified of the Majima Everywhere System?
[2:46:56] <%NovaKnightmare> Pat do you have a good recommendation to not being so angry all the freaking time?
[2:46:58] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> pat is trying his best dont laugh at him
[2:47:00] <%TeraMercier> I really like the amount of video game in this video game
[2:47:09] <+Javaa01> You so
[2:47:12] <excedebuster> Man I hate psychology they want me to write with big dumb words instead of dumb small human word
[2:47:13] <sileo_patronus> this is what we call Patforming
[2:47:15] <Monkeyweed21> NO IT'S NOT\
[2:47:17] <%doc_ock_rokc> 10 seconds
[2:47:18] <$CarlosEoM> how many seconds can you move in the stopped time?
[2:47:20] <Tisaric> @tearknack he's near the end of base game but still has a good amount of DLC left - this was the last world before DLC
[2:47:22] <dukenux> @MelBrooksKA No that's being parano- rational
[2:47:23] <@lewdskeletor13> I’m convinced my dad has undiagnosed OCD because he has really compulsive rituals he has to do
[2:47:24] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> helps if you have that cooldown badge
[2:47:24] <Bad1uck> @rhinoprotoss I doubt it. The room isn't covered in mustard
[2:47:27] <%GeneralSCPatton> Use cooldown badge
[2:47:37] <%snow_bush> Kono Hat Girl DA
[2:47:47] <+talfurt> if you monologue during it lasts like 5 minutes
[2:47:48] <laserbeaming> I love the Small Time Hat
[2:47:49] <Tisaric> This level is just pure platforming challenges and I love it for that
[2:47:51] <ReiDuran> This theme calms the hell out of me
[2:47:52] <%AbnormalVoid> SourPls
[2:47:53] <Louie_Salmon> I assume there is some mod that has the dio sound effects and everything
[2:48:04] <%Kataguro> Scoot
[2:48:06] <Shwepie> A platforming game where your shadow is always directly beneath you? Madness!
[2:48:09] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Louie_Salmon you assume correctly
[2:48:13] <+razielhex> A hat in time's had for time for hat kid's time power
[2:48:13] <+Javaa01> You spent 10 minutes on the first hurdle that anyone else would have cleared in a minute
[2:48:15] <%TeraMercier> To be fair, Psychology is talking about very specific things, so you need specific words
[2:48:22] <%crimsonharvest> look up what was that bell on a string
[2:48:30] <+sixcubit> i can't wait for him to try the Seal The Deal version of the windmill
[2:48:38] <Tisaric> You need to double jump
[2:48:42] <Daniel_Is_I> Double jump at the wall
[2:48:43] <Tisaric> before the wal
[2:48:44] <Louie_Salmon> I'm almost certain you can reach those
[2:48:46] <%TeraMercier> There's totes a jotaro and the world mod for this
[2:48:47] <@lewdskeletor13> So this is the last base game level?
[2:48:51] <%Kataguro> Did Pat forget about the sandbags?
[2:48:58] <+razielhex> Stoop kid's gonna leave his stoop.
[2:49:02] <%crimsonharvest> never dont sandbag
[2:49:02] <%doc_ock_rokc> @lewdskeletor13 kinda penultimate level

[2:49:16] <buffmurffy> there are DLC levels too
[2:49:16] <SparrowHW> got a checkpoint, try it why not
[2:49:19] <Tisaric> DOUBLE JUMP
[2:49:21] <TyrantBelial> And then the DLC
[2:49:29] <+Javaa01> Double jump
[2:49:37] <Bad1uck> @razielhex Your statement makes my brain hurt
[2:49:50] <excedebuster> What are Pats feelings on part 5. My sister loves it, but I don’t feel it personally
[2:49:59] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> rip yarn
[2:50:00] <+razielhex> "Jeez that's awkward" says man who spent 1500 hours doing Space Robot Parkour in Warframe, but can't do a reverse wall-jump in child's platformer.
[2:50:11] <Luvinsus> BONK
[2:50:12] <+sixcubit> BOTCHED
[2:50:15] <+Javaa01> You get a 3rd jump after a wall run even after double jumping, always double jump
[2:50:25] <%TeraMercier> @AngriestPat Seconded, Pat how do you feel about Golden Wind in comparison to the other jojo parts?

[2:54:04] <+razielhex> Hat Kid's only weakness is singing, for the Gospel of Truth defies her Apocryphal Heresies.

[2:55:07] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> paat attacc
[2:55:10] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> get fucked, said the kid to the spikder
[2:55:11] <%Frost_Quill> The Death Wish version of THIS level is fucking insane. Everything moves at a super fast speed and you have to do it in one try or you don't get the bonus.
[2:55:13] <a_mad_dragon> @AngriestPat come on mr. "path of pain wasn't that bad" you can do better than this
[2:55:14] <@lewdskeletor13> DO NOT LEWD MY CHILD

[2:55:17] <+razielhex> As long as Dana Gould isn't involved @Zombiemowlcher
[2:55:27] <%spiritofmojave> Hat Kid is pure!
[2:55:30] <%tigerfang86> the LEWD SKELETOR saying not to lewd things is a big deal
[2:55:35] <+Zombiemowlcher> @televisedrevolting She DOES have a ship that uses time as a fuel source
[2:55:36] <@lewdskeletor13> PrideBisexual

[2:55:38] <%SirGO0SE> pure murder
[2:55:41] <+miguelrod777> hat kid is not pure she loves murder
[2:55:45] <%TeraMercier> In death wish mode does hat kid get sick gloves and a moustache
[2:55:46] <%Frost_Quill> By one try I mean do the entire level on one health. You can retry it as many times as you want.
[2:55:47] <%Kataguro> We Mario Sunshine now
[2:55:51] <%NovaKnightmare> wait bisexuals have a flag?

[2:57:50] <sileo_patronus> @LouieRouie I can believe it
[2:57:54] <+Javaa01> Hat Kid exists to cull the weak
[2:57:56] <%squidking96> @lewdskeletor13 but what about Shad Pope?
[2:57:57] <+razielhex> @Deekman Woolie spawned from the hole only when the Birther had aligned the stones in the correct order to herald the coming of the Demi-God MAHVEL.

[2:58:19] <televisedrevolting> Hat Kid could just be one of those all powerful super deities who appears in the form of a small child.
[2:58:19] <Valentinius_Anodyne> How many war crimes do you think Hat Kid has committed?

[2:59:05] <+razielhex> Hat Kid is no hero
[2:59:15] <%Ilpala> it's got the fart gas
[2:59:22] <%Frost_Quill> Wait, did Pat find the camera?
[2:59:26] <Meta_Four> Hat Kid really isn't moody enough to be Byronic.
[2:59:26] <%TeraMercier> Why does Pat, the largest of the influencers, not simply eat the others?
[2:59:28] <Noshi1234> pat kid is the hero we need
[2:59:32] <%spiritofmojave> Hat Kid is just a young killer
[2:59:41] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> just not the one we deserve.
[2:59:41] <+Javaa01> There are no more heroes in this world, and Hat Kid isn't one either
[2:59:42] <%doc_ock_rokc> @TeraMercier the others are stronger
[2:59:42] <morcego_cinzento_arts> good evening
[2:59:43] <a_mad_dragon> hat kid is a kriby, she invaded this peaceful world and fucking ruined it

[3:00:26] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> Pat
[3:00:32] <%ryome> Heavy is the head that wears the Hat
[3:00:39] <televisedrevolting> Hat Kid is a wonderer who works for her own gain. What she has to do to acquire her time pieces does not matter, they are merely a delay in their inevitable return to where they rightfully belong.
[3:00:44] <morcego_cinzento_arts> Pat would be the ultimate parkour if not for being a ginger midget
[3:00:52] <McAngrimStein> Hat Kid is Inevitable
[3:00:54] <%FrustratedAF> PARKOUR
[3:00:56] <%TeraMercier> Is this one of those games where you never feel like letting go of forward
[3:01:09] <+razielhex> Hat Kid is inevitable, as she is an integral part of the cycle of creation and destruction of the universe.
[3:01:09] <televisedrevolting> @mcangrimstein You're goddamn right.
[3:01:15] <Bad1uck> @teramercier The others serve as reliquaries for his soul
[3:01:20] <+razielhex> Hat Kid is the harbinger of the degenerative era.

[3:04:05] <Tisaric> it was left
[3:04:11] <%deviljhojho94> True true, woolie IS the sheep now
[3:04:13] <@lewdskeletor13> I think my favorite world still was the movie studio one. I loved that Scrooge McDuck asshole
[3:04:13] <%tigerfang86> you zagged
[3:04:15] <%FrustratedAF> its the GOAT
[3:04:16] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> So, is he gonna do the DLC right after this, or do the final world?
[3:04:20] <%TeraMercier> THAT'S A FUCKIN VOOODOO VINCE SEQUENCe
[3:04:20] <%tigerfang86> when you should have zigged
[3:04:23] <%Frost_Quill> You zigged when you should have zagged.
[3:04:28] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> then DLC?
[3:04:30] <Tisaric> yeah Dead Bird Studio is still the best world
[3:04:36] <TyrantBelial> Just gonan point out this disease is causing pruple lightning styorms
[3:04:36] <McAngrimStein> man, I'm kinda salty none of the DLC ever came to PS4
[3:04:38] <%GeneralSCPatton> Woolie IS BABA
[3:04:39] <televisedrevolting> @lewdskeletor13 Persona 5's Joker as Scrooge McDuck.
[3:04:39] <Valentinius_Anodyne> You should
[3:04:45] <+razielhex> Pat needs a Bow Kid companion. Get Paige for Bow Kid
[3:04:45] <$Valdorick> The LS
[3:04:45] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> Old habits
[3:04:47] <%valkuma> the Arctic cruise world is pretty fun i recommend it
[3:04:48] <SparrowHW> dlc is good
[3:04:48] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> strelp
[3:04:52] <el_phthalo> He dipped when shoulda dabbed.
[3:04:53] <%tigerfang86> the other DLC is just as chill and fun as the main worlds
[3:04:54] <%cherubs_anonymous> You're gonna, bitch
[3:04:55] <Buzzard42> This is easily the best world
[3:04:55] <%crimsonharvest> Windy Passage is what i call my butthole
[3:04:55] <%tigerfang86> imo
[3:04:55] <don_lobo_> Second DLC has the best world
[3:04:56] <%Venhammer> the dlc is really good
[3:04:57] <a_mad_dragon> you HAVE to at least fight nyajima
[3:04:59] <Buzzard42> but I haven't done the DLC worlds, so
[3:05:01] <TheLordOfTheScrubs> "the LP", too soon
[3:05:02] <$MetalPanic> the Nyakuza world is super stylish
[3:05:03] <Liquid_Dio> Nyakiza Metro is dope, you can skip Arctic Vruise
[3:05:03] <@lewdskeletor13> @mcangrimstein It probably will eventually
[3:05:04] <Buzzard42> they could be better
[3:05:06] <+Javaa01> Do the Vanilla ending first, and do the DLC worlds after
[3:05:06] <Kghaleon> 1,100+ people isn't much?
[3:05:08] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> final world doesn't take too long. But yeah, the DLC is great.
[3:05:08] <$Valdorick> Damn it dragon, don't spoil the fun >.>
[3:05:10] <%Frost_Quill> Nyakuza is tied with Spooky Forest for being my favorite level.
[3:05:13] <paiguy> Nyakuza is so good
[3:05:16] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> Yeah fighting nyajima seems pretty important
[3:05:17] <Tisaric> It's super hard for them to port pretty much anything to the consoles since this is built on fucking Unreal 3 which nothing supports anymore
[3:05:23] <McAngrimStein> @lewdskeletor13 Hope so, but it's been a while since the first and still no word
[3:05:24] <@lewdskeletor13> I would do the original ending first, then DLCs
[3:05:32] <+Zombiemowlcher> Hey pat, I'm 24 years old and I don't know what I want to do with my life. How did you figure out what you wanted to do?
[3:05:39] <+Just_GR> Finally got to catch you on stream. Fresh off the latest ep of the podcast. How are you, Pat?
[3:05:39] <Buzzard42> do all original content first
[3:05:49] <Bad1uck> @televisedrevolting don't worry, Squeenix has as well. Thankfully we're getting a Nier Automata raid in FF14
[3:05:51] <%doc_ock_rokc> Use timestop!
[3:05:52] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> @Zombiemowlcher he spent years baggin groceries and being depressed
[3:05:53] <TyrantBelial> fucking Flamestrikes
[3:05:55] <SparrowHW> if only there were a time related hat that could help here
[3:05:59] <@lewdskeletor13> @just_gr Welcome to the stream! Glad you’re here
[3:05:59] <%tigerfang86> shit's CRAZY
[3:06:04] <Slendermanr> the new dlc is very pretty and it has new ingame emotes
[3:06:09] <%TeraMercier> ZA CRAZY TALKo
[3:06:19] <%NovaKnightmare> @Zombiemowlcher Pat is not the best person to ask on that because he got really lucky with youtube, but I am in that boat with ya friend
[3:06:21] <%doc_ock_rokc> apatCrazyhand apatCrazyhead apatHoldon
[3:06:23] <televisedrevolting> @bad1uck Sweet. Now if I could only bring myself to play FF14...
[3:06:24] <@commanderclaw> Nyakuza has hidden Ryu ga Gotoku references
[3:06:32] <Tisaric> nyakuza metro has some of the best level design
[3:06:32] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> my favorite emote...CAT CRIIIIIME
[3:06:34] <McAngrimStein> Try a bunch of different jobs and fall into a career you don't entirely hate, that's what I did
[3:06:35] <Tisaric> It's so good
[3:06:40] <McAngrimStein> It's like playing an MMO
[3:06:42] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> aww
[3:06:48] <+MeatBomb> Hey look, it's plague rat vines. Perfectly ordinary.
[3:06:48] <+razielhex> He took your advice @Javaa01
[3:06:51] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> So brave
[3:06:52] <$Valdorick> No Mario Cart 64 cuts for you.
[3:06:57] <TheLordOfTheScrubs> the biggest leap of faith
[3:06:57] <ReiDuran> speedrun strats
[3:06:57] <%TeraMercier> @McAngrimStein Livin the dream for real
[3:06:59] <+Zombiemowlcher> thanks @NovaKnightmare
[3:07:01] <%FrustratedAF> pat's learnin to speedrun??
[3:07:03] <@lewdskeletor13> I’m a bagger currently so I have nowhere to go but up
[3:07:08] <%LtShuckle> just do the wuhu island shortcut
[3:07:13] <%Frost_Quill> @AngriestPat Unrelated to A Hat in Time, how do you feel about the Sims games? I've never heard you talk about them.
[3:07:15] <%D33TR> can confirm, i took a year off university to work in a kitchen and it gave me time research different careers and not just be in school just cause you're supposed to be
[3:07:17] <Monkeyweed21> And so Hat Kid cast herself from the highest cliff in all of Ollympus
[3:07:30] <%squidking96> hey skeletor
[3:07:31] <@lewdskeletor13> @monkeyweed21 LUL
[3:07:32] <%D33TR> got a pretty great career now at 30 that i love, just hunt around, do job shadows
[3:07:45] <@lewdskeletor13> Yo Squid what up
[3:07:47] <+Zombiemowlcher> I take care of mentally challenged adults and it's so soul crushing
[3:07:58] <%squidking96> well done steak is best steak
[3:08:04] <Tisaric> that sounds really draining definitely
[3:08:05] <@lewdskeletor13> @zombiemowlcher I’m sorry you don’t enjoy it
[3:08:13] <McAngrimStein> @Zombiemowlcher I did something similar for a while on the side, it's rough
[3:08:16] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> L I G H T N I N G
[3:08:17] <%doc_ock_rokc> @squidking96 I'd agree with you but then we'd both be wrong
[3:08:19] <@lewdskeletor13> It’s not a career for everyone
[3:08:26] <%NovaKnightmare> dont die
[3:08:28] <%D33TR> do you enjoy working with people though? medical might be an option still but perhaps not working with those with disabilities
[3:08:29] <%doc_ock_rokc> Double jump
[3:08:32] <Meta_Four> Fire hurt.
[3:08:34] <Meta_Four> Fire bad.
[3:08:35] <@lewdskeletor13> Also medium steak is the best Squid, so I have decreed
[3:08:35] <+Zombiemowlcher> @lewdskeletor13 It's not the people I take care of, its the politics in the buisness

[3:08:56] <Buzzard42> find a better place to work then, if you like the profession but not the workplace
[3:09:00] <Tisaric> good old work politics
[3:09:04] <Hazlet95> of all the times you grab it unnecessarily and you skip it when you need it
[3:09:05] <%squidking96> Ssaryn is cool and skeletor is a nerd
[3:09:16] <Noshi1234> he's doing it!

[3:11:38] <%Frost_Quill> @AngriestPat Unrelated to A Hat in Time, how do you feel about the Sims games? I've never heard you talk about them. This level reminds me of the newest Sims 4 dlc.
[3:11:41] <%tigerfang86> Not pat's fault
[3:11:41] <don_lobo_> And so, Pat called the DEA and remove all that pesky purple kush off the streets, and the goats went back to not eating all the Doritos
[3:11:41] <%deviljhojho94> Patricio "Quintessential Gamer" Boivin

[3:12:01] <OkamiDude15> Guess I missed pat using time stop for the first time
[3:12:07] <Tisaric> @AngriestPat I'd suggest doing the time rifts and then the original final boss now before the DLC
[3:12:11] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> time for attic
[3:12:12] <+Zombiemowlcher> good pay and great job security
[3:12:12] <%TombstoneTTromboners> It's TIME PAT
[3:12:13] <Louie_Salmon> I hope we're doing the finale tonight, it's fairly short
[3:12:16] <%doc_ock_rokc> YOu can DLC or finish the main game!
[3:12:16] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> oh wait
[3:12:18] <%LtShuckle> do final level
[3:12:23] <Buzzard42> yes
[3:12:23] <+razielhex> "I've destroyed your village's agriculture and enslaved your livestock, who now worship me as their Dark Mother, simply as a lark to obtain the control of time on your world" -- Hat Kid
[3:12:23] <@lewdskeletor13> Pats life is already a game of the Sims where someone is just fucking around
[3:12:25] <%Kataguro> You need to construct the relic for the Purple Rift
[3:12:29] <+Masutasodo> 39 time pieces before finale in base game
[3:12:29] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> Race in First World too
[3:12:32] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> Mafia Town
[3:12:36] <%D33TR> @Zombiemowlcher RN is a great profession, but its very competitive and there is unfortunately a lot of hospital politics as well
[3:12:40] <Kghaleon> final boss tho
[3:12:43] <Tisaric> oh yeah we have mafia town now
[3:12:49] <CalderGaming> crazy talk is just the username of the sims player editing pat's world to make him wrong
[3:12:55] <+wah_ha_ha> Final Boss fight when?
[3:12:58] <@lewdskeletor13> There’s still a final boss yeah?
[3:13:03] <Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> did pat do the rocket race yet?
[3:13:05] <Luvinsus> Yes, that's chapter 5
[3:13:10] <%Kataguro> Final boss, 3 rifts here, and Mafia Town race
[3:13:13] <%doc_ock_rokc> @lewdskeletor13 yes pat is just getting motivated
[3:13:19] <%Frost_Quill> If you put together the relics you get another time rift for this level too.
[3:13:19] <@lewdskeletor13> Got it
[3:13:20] <Valentinius_Anodyne> "The day your home was destroyed, it was the most important day of your life. But for me, it was Thursday." -Hat Kid
[3:13:21] <Tisaric> he needs to do like 3 or 4 more rifts and the Mafia Town race
[3:13:22] <+razielhex> Pat just needs to forget the Sims and go full Ralph Pootawn
[3:13:30] <@lewdskeletor13> @valentinius_anodyne That’s great
[3:13:42] <+Zombiemowlcher> @D33TR Yeah but there's work outside of hospitals too

[3:20:36] <%D33TR> so you often manage some of the lesser acuity patients if you're in somewhere fast paced like urgent care and such, and if you're on a medical ward or icu you're often the one in charge of the attending physicians plan after they leave, or make choices on their behalf

[3:36:04] <%Kataguro> Yes
[3:36:05] <+redyoshi5> yes
[3:36:07] <%TombstoneTTromboners> yeah, it's all one planet
[3:36:07] <%LouieRouie> yeah
[3:36:09] <%LtShuckle> this is all one big planet
[3:36:11] <%Farples> They're all on the same planet
[3:36:12] <%Frost_Quill> Yeah.
[3:36:12] <Tisaric> yes all of these worlds are one planet
[3:36:13] <%TombstoneTTromboners> except for dj grooves levels
[3:36:16] <SparrowHW> very diverse biomes
[3:36:17] <%TombstoneTTromboners> they're on the moon
[3:36:19] <%Divryne> The planet is flat.
[3:36:19] <%Kataguro> Earth is weird in AHiT
[3:36:19] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat think hawaii and tibet
[3:36:19] <+Javaa01> Everything is on the same planet
[3:36:22] <%DedlokPM> mogsLoud PECK THE MAFIA
[3:36:24] <%Frost_Quill> Bird stuff is on the moon, rest is on the same planet.
[3:36:25] <%Farples> When you look at the world map you can see the other areas
[3:36:29] <King_Wolf_Rigger> I was under the impression that it was all different planets
[3:36:30] <%Sk0aks> i think the purple time rifts happen when a timepeice hits someone in the head
[3:36:33] <TyrantSlime> Earth is very confusing
[3:36:34] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> its beyond the ice wall
[3:36:36] <Tisaric> The Time Rifts are of course their own little things but the rest is all one planet
[3:36:36] <+masked_hero_lucky> It’s all on the same planet pretty sure
[3:36:38] <%doc_ock_rokc> DOWN THE THE MAFIA!
[3:36:38] <NotSoAccurateNo1> it's more confusing than amalgamation Garfield
[3:36:45] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> Trash can

[3:37:02] <%TeraMercier> Garfield the elder abomination
[3:37:03] <%deviljhojho94> sqursk

[3:37:22] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> Shakedown Shakedown
[3:37:24] <+masked_hero_lucky> Though Dead Bird Studio is actually on the moon.
[3:37:26] <+MeatBomb> No snaching!
[3:37:49] <+Javaa01> DBD has a moon set
[3:38:00] <+Javaa01> it's not on the moon
[3:38:04] <ReiDuran> how about I snatch your shit
[3:38:09] <televisedrevolting> For everyone who want to see Eldritch Ambonination Garfield, there is tons of pictures of that shit on the interwebs, but more specifically r/imsorryjon.
[3:38:21] <%Frost_Quill> Is there another page here? I don't remember.
[3:38:22] <+Masutasodo> This isn't even the biggest section of this time rift
[3:38:27] <televisedrevolting> @televisedrevolt *wants
[3:38:39] <+masked_hero_lucky> In the DJ Grooves levels it has moon gravity, you’re on the moon
[3:38:40] <Luvinsus> Ahhh, good to know Pat is just as paranoid as I am on these levels LUL
[3:38:52] <a_mad_dragon> is it the boosh moon though
[3:38:53] <Tisaric> SourPls
[3:38:53] <%demegodz> yyeyeyeyeye
[3:38:57] <%TeraMercier> As someone who liked garfield comics more than they deserved as a kid, eldritch evil garfield is a surprisingly engaging new headcanon
[3:39:05] <combobreaks> You’re missing more than one!!!
[3:39:09] <Thirtine> this track reminds me of celeste! <3
[3:39:10] <$El_Desperad0> This whole game is amazing
[3:39:11] <+MeatBomb> Is there even ONE bad track in this?
[3:39:11] <%allouttajuice> this track giving me celeste vibes
[3:39:11] <%demegodz> the soft slap
[3:39:12] <RiverBirch> Slaps <3
[3:39:18] <Tisaric> I really just can't get over how fucking good the dynamic mixing is
[3:39:20] <%LtShuckle> one day lyman will truly exist
[3:39:20] <+Centrilion> it is blobDance
[3:39:22] <Sulliman34> did yall hear about the garfield themed food delivery app
[3:39:22] <+Surf_Zombie> Celeste yes
[3:39:35] <zenith0111> I really need to get this game.
[3:39:39] <CybertronPrime> Check out Lumpytouch on Youtube for more monster Garfield stuff.
[3:39:50] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> they laugh at your stumps
[3:39:51] <%Kataguro> S T U M P S
[3:39:52] <%NovaKnightmare> bullets dont work jon
[3:39:56] <Sulliman34> if yall like horror stuff id recommend NightMind
[3:39:57] <+razielhex> Friggin' owlz, amirite?
[3:40:00] <%Frost_Quill> Isn't there a comic that implies Garfield is actually an ownerless cat who's starving to death in an abandoned house?
[3:40:12] <Valentinius_Anodyne> There is indeed
[3:40:12] <Buzzard42> yes
[3:40:14] <+masked_hero_lucky> I love the big goat bois
[3:40:16] <@lewdskeletor13> Left for a bit, what’s Pat doing now?
[3:40:16] <a_mad_dragon> lumpytouch WutFace
[3:40:20] <Sulliman34> most "garfield theories" are just for fun but theyre interesting
[3:40:20] <Tisaric> that's just Garfield without Jon right?
[3:40:23] <Meta_Four> That was a Halloween What-if story.
[3:40:25] <+razielhex> @Frost_Quill So the opposite of Garfield without Garfield
[3:40:31] <%TeraMercier> Pat's not using timestop
[3:40:32] <Sulliman34> jon for sure drank that dog nut tho
[3:40:36] <Warbot40> This is my new favorite 3D platformer. Even better than Odyssey just for the personality.
[3:40:36] <%Frost_Quill> @lewdskeletor13 LORE time rift.
[3:40:38] <sileo_patronus> @Frost_Quill Was just reminded of that yesterday when a friend posted it in discord
[3:40:40] <%Kataguro> Dig up?
[3:40:42] <televisedrevolting> @frost_quill Weirdly enough, yes. Which was done by Jim Davis himself, as a Halloween special.
[3:40:47] <+LadyFrederic47> !uptime
[3:40:48] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 40m.
[3:40:50] <Buzzard42> yeah this game was cuter than Odyssey
[3:40:55] <Buzzard42> I think it plays better too
[3:41:06] <Sulliman34> mario has more weight which can feel nice
[3:41:13] <Sulliman34> but for prolonged play hat kid has better feel
[3:41:23] <%TeraMercier> It seems like this game controls like DMC5 compared to Odyssey DMC4
[3:41:32] <SixthSun2> Wall jump
[3:41:35] <Sulliman34> thats an oddly apt comparison
[3:41:40] <%TeraMercier> Inertia was different
[3:41:40] <Warbot40> Odyssey is top tier but it doesn't get as crazy with it's kingdoms as it could've
[3:41:47] <%doc_ock_rokc> @TeraMercier yes
[3:41:55] <Buzzard42> andyLUL
[3:41:56] <RiverBirch> The Camera Charm is actually pretty good for getting a good layout of the level
[3:41:59] <Sulliman34> yeah id say odyssey's downfall isnt in its mechanics but in its level design
[3:42:05] <RiverBirch> and checking out where the secrets are
[3:42:06] <combobreaks> Really wish they give us odyssey DLC at e3
[3:42:14] <Tisaric> I mean it works
[3:42:15] <King_Wolf_Rigger> wow
[3:42:15] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> wow
[3:42:17] <combobreaks> Imagine how hype three more worlds would be
[3:42:17] <%demegodz> cheese
[3:42:19] <CurrySauseBandit> LUL
[3:42:19] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> nice Pat

[3:42:19] <NotSoAccurateNo1> ass parkour
[3:42:21] <korsablade> BIG BRAIN
[3:42:22] <%matrixManipulator> It just works
[3:42:24] <pectusumbra> damage boost
[3:42:24] <%Niney_Who> I wonder if it can make you go higher
[3:42:25] <SparrowHW> go higher up
[3:42:26] <Thirtine> PogChamp that worked
[3:42:26] <%demegodz> asskour
[3:42:27] <%NovaKnightmare> a small price for Salvation
[3:42:27] <+Redpointshine> my other stream is on break so im checkin in, whats poppin pattholomew
[3:42:27] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> why is pat so good at videogames
[3:42:29] <a_mad_dragon> BURNING ass parkour
[3:42:30] <SparrowHW> nevermind
[3:42:30] <%brave_sj> pro gamer move
[3:42:36] <The1WhoKnoxx> this sounds like banjo kazooie/yuka laylee music am I crazy?
[3:42:37] <%logoth_> Hat in Time feels like the best 3d platform since Mario 64, it just controls and feels so good; and has so much heart
[3:42:41] <ShichiNoBushi> I doubt it would be intended. You shouldn't be forced to take damage.
[3:42:42] <GhostPyre> Remember pink rifts have no checkpoints. Be careful.
[3:42:44] <CurrySauseBandit> You can do it no damage but that's a way easier way
[3:42:49] <%valkuma> I think this is the first jump where you're supposed to learn to not double jump before wall running
[3:42:49] <+redyoshi5> @Warbot40 absolutely that is why i am so hoping for a mario odyssey 2 in the coming year it lines up with how long it took to make mario galaxy 2
[3:42:57] <Tisaric> There's 2 in this part for sure
[3:43:03] <a_mad_dragon> i want to see parkour races now where the racers have their pants set on fire and can't put it out until they reach the finish line
[3:43:04] <Sulliman34> id like to see a more expanded new donk city if they make a 2
[3:43:06] <Tisaric> I remember this area
[3:43:07] <ReiDuran> This one is kind of a bitch
[3:43:10] <NotSoAccurateNo1> boy they really cleaned up the music tracks since I last played
[3:43:13] <%spiritofmojave> Comfy rain music
[3:43:37] <%doc_ock_rokc> This song puts me to sleep
[3:43:41] <%TeraMercier> Shit, as much as this game looks like it outstrips Odyssey in everything I care about, I'd still be super stoked for Odyssey 2

[3:43:45] <%deviljhojho94> THIS IS TEH URN
[3:43:45] <RiverBirch> I remember where 1 of the maps is
[3:43:49] <$Kingdomgene> Reminds me of Spiral Knights for some reason
[3:43:51] <RiverBirch> in here
[3:43:51] <Warbot40> If stuff like ruined kingdom was fully expanded with 1 or 2 more outlandish worlds like New Donk then it'd be closer. @redyoshi5

[3:45:20] <%Kataguro> 40 in base, yeah

[3:46:06] <RiverBirch> I forget that one
[3:46:11] <%doc_ock_rokc> Get on top of the arch at the front

[3:46:14] <%matrixManipulator> Ohh, forgot the race
[3:46:25] <RiverBirch> Gotta CHEAT CHEAT CHEAT
[3:46:26] <Warbot40> This game has some polish and camera issues but that's expected. Also stuff like Arctic Cruise isn't the best on first playthrough.
[3:46:39] <+masked_hero_lucky> Oh yeah, Pat has to cheat the race
[3:46:41] <zenith0111> Got to cheat like you mean it
[3:46:42] <NotSoAccurateNo1> climb the waterfall

[3:46:51] <SparrowHW> jump on roof?
[3:46:52] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> did you get the one under the water?
[3:46:57] <Sulliman34> can you not just jump from under one block and run up the other
[3:47:00] <Caidezes> stumb
[3:47:00] <a_mad_dragon> NOT the birdhouse roofs, i made that mistake already
[3:47:05] <%brave_sj> Go up the waerfall
[3:47:23] <zenith0111> Big Brain

[3:47:41] <Luvinsus> There's still another page here BTW
[3:47:42] <Warbot40> Right now I'm just craving for the next wave of 3D collect-a-Thons. Hope Playtonic improves a lot with their next game assuming it's Yooka-Laylee 2.
[3:47:44] <Tisaric> @AngriestPat you had the right idea looking for a page in the waterfall
[3:47:44] <+redyoshi5> worth a shot
[3:47:45] <%QueequegTheater> QueequegTheater subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months! Almost a year, cool. Pat, is it normal for melee DPS to feel like they're not doing much damage?
[3:47:48] <%Frost_Quill> Gonna be honest, I don't remember where the last page is at ALL.
[3:47:51] <%Wallabri> oh my god wooliePOYO wooliePOYO wooliePOYO

[3:56:08] <%demegodz> did you slapshit?
