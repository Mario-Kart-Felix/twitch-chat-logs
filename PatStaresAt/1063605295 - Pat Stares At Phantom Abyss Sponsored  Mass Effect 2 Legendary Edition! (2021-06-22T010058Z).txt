[0:13:43] <%skeleklng> wanna see Jacob get a rocket to the face
[0:13:44] <Virokwet> maybe a missing loyalty
[0:13:44] <$SGrim> Mordin? More like more-dead
[0:13:45] <%animaturgy> I lost Miranda and was like "win/win"
[0:13:46] <Josef_Stryker> Mordin is the weakest
[0:13:47] <Broken_Sonex> "Tell them.....i held the line...."
[0:13:47] <%Garthunox> Did you send him in the tubes?
[0:13:47] <%Ranryu692> basically if you don't send him back with the crew he dies, I believe
[0:13:49] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> I might have a clue why
[0:13:49] <%Mattais88> probably took too many tanks into the terminator fight
[0:13:54] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt you need to have Mordin take the crew to safety
[0:13:54] <%Varlinator> When did he die?
[0:13:57] <%StaceMcGate> GARRUS
[0:13:59] <+JonathLP> Garrus and Tali
[0:13:59] <+LegacyOfTheSith> i lost thane idk why but i was hella mad too
[0:13:59] <%dekkitout> Grunt and Jack?
[0:14:01] <%rumtumtugnutz> probably a heroin overdose.
[0:14:02] <jackelzxaa> you have to leave garrus, grunt, AND zaeed with the rest of the squad when you fight the final boss so that they raise your defense score and keep no one from dying
[0:14:02] <Josef_Stryker> I vote Thane
[0:14:04] <stantheman_97> i lost jack and legion because I didn't upgrade my ship
[0:14:04] <%embranz> Did you know Mordin dies or natural causes is you play for more than 80 hours @patstaresat
[0:14:05] <%JamesCorck> Garrus' has some pretty cool dialogue for Thane.
[0:14:06] <seancbo> I put him in charge of hacking cause I was like eh, he's smart LUL turns out as a biologist he didnt have the best skills
[0:14:07] <ScreamLord> Dextro Squad
[0:14:08] <%JamesCorck> 8D
[0:14:10] <%JamesCorck> YUSH.
[0:14:12] <%rumtumtugnutz> Whenever someone dies off screen it's a heroin overdose
[0:14:14] <MasterTonberry23> If youre not using Mordin in the last part, send him back with the survivors
[0:14:16] <%bassoontyphoon> Kasumi
[0:14:18] <$SGrim> DEXTRO SQUAD
[0:14:19] <Josef_Stryker> Dextro Duo for Life!
[0:14:21] <%strakillias> Pump that Dex
[0:14:22] <jackelzxaa> characters have a hidden hold the line score that effects the chance of someone dying at the end after the final boss
[0:14:23] <+Buzzkill983> Garrus is good for Thane mission imo
[0:14:24] <tattleworm> i feel like i remember zaeed having some fun things to say on thane's mission
[0:14:25] <stantheman_97> dextro gang
[0:14:27] <%hat_under_bread> What? Taking the two best characters with you? Unpossible.
[0:14:27] <ScreamLord> Or actually, Ambidextro Squad
[0:14:27] <knight_verse> How innovative of you.
[0:14:27] <+wmeldrum> how long do quarians live?
[0:14:28] <ThatWeirdGuyFromWork> Blow through Jacob's loyalty mission and buy the Advanced Training research project to get Barrier from ME1 back.
[0:14:29] <+JonathLP> slow mo walk
[0:14:30] <+Rayze41> Isn’t Mordin kinda random if he stays at hold the line?
[0:14:32] <$RealThiele> the good ones
[0:14:37] <chancho4tierra> Kasumi whould be a good friend to Thane
[0:14:45] <%Varlinator> Definately take them to Samara's mission
[0:14:46] <Zalapski> i can't believe pat is going to cuck garrus, that's messed up
[0:14:46] <%Ranryu692> fascism squad member and genocide squad member, huh
[0:14:53] <%BoxNavy> yea
[0:14:54] <%Dfreddy8> Yes
[0:14:54] <%AzureGale> This is cool
[0:14:55] <Kain5707> yes
[0:14:57] <%athuramn> yes
[0:14:57] <%skeleklng> yea man
[0:14:58] <%JamesCorck> It's got more game.
[0:14:58] <%Mooseman_> mordin dies at the end of you don't leave strong enough characters to hold the line.
[0:14:59] <Laecerelius> It's new and scary
[0:15:00] <%CoffeeKaiju> yeah, bigger screen!
[0:15:00] <+Ghufufin> actual size PAT
[0:15:00] <%JoshManVGH> It's neat!
[0:15:00] <%Tman451> I like it
[0:15:00] <ScreamLord> Hello
[0:15:01] <%topendbuzza> looks good
[0:15:01] <%JamesCorck> So yeah.
[0:15:02] <Djinnazz> Ehh
[0:15:02] <karl_rex> No
[0:15:03] <%Quigsies> kind of yea
[0:15:03] <crocboyz> yeah its fun to see you in a small box
[0:15:03] <%Spydurman> eh
[0:15:04] <JoshTheFace> yes
[0:15:04] <%twistedj3ster> idk, it's too soon to judge
[0:15:04] <aiutare47> I like it, the frame is a bit weird
[0:15:05] <+JonathLP> @PatStaresAt Eh, no better, no worse
[0:15:05] <%HanbaobaoZaiNar> its slick
[0:15:06] <%hat_under_bread> It's different, but it's fine.
[0:15:07] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> you are small but powerful
[0:15:07] <tanarath> YEAH! More screen is great!
[0:15:07] <%JamesCorck> This is psaBig psaUp
[0:15:08] <Alzero83> Its prety good
[0:15:09] <%Dakuu75> You're a smide, TOO-TINY for me
[0:15:09] <Profmcstevie> it feels weird you being smaller
[0:15:10] <%Ranryu692> I would prefer if the donations popped above you so that you were lower in the corner
[0:15:10] <$SGrim> @Ranryu692 He made the reich choices. Keepo
[0:15:12] <%BoxNavy> blunt like weed :)
[0:15:12] <Broken_Sonex> Eh
[0:15:13] <RayCSmooth> make it smaller Kappa
[0:15:14] <%Spydurman> feels weird it's not in the corner
[0:15:16] <jorniev> WAIT CONRAD VERNON IN THE RADIO?
[0:15:18] <Pookiedaexzile> He did it for the money
[0:15:19] <%topendbuzza> game big
[0:15:20] <tattleworm> it has larger game
[0:15:20] <%AzureGale> The game is just bigger
[0:15:21] <%Dfreddy8> It's less Obnoxious
[0:15:22] <James_Quivers> Zero more game
[0:15:26] <aiutare47> it looks like it does, so thats what matters
[0:15:26] <%JamesCorck> It seemed to have a bigger window, odd.
[0:15:29] <$RealThiele> zap
[0:15:31] <%Ranryu692> @Ranryu692 LUL
[0:15:31] <TourettesPlays> I hate Samara so much its unreal
[0:15:32] <%MidnightBurst12> seems larger
[0:15:32] <+burntbagels13> You look like Zod in his prison
[0:15:35] <Josef_Stryker> Did Pat already meet Conrad?
[0:15:39] <+JonathLP> @PatStaresAt Did you call our donations crap?
[0:15:41] <%AzureGale> Pat has crap under him, what?
[0:15:43] <%walternatorz> pat is implying people need to donate more
[0:15:43] <%Ranryu692> can you put it over you?
[0:15:46] <%JamesCorck> Isn't the game video bigger? My bad n.n
[0:15:49] <%skeleklng> put it over shepard's face during convos so we can imagine it being you
[0:15:50] <+wmeldrum> HINT HINT
[0:15:51] <$RealThiele> LUL
[0:15:53] <%BoxNavy> someone should donate :)
[0:16:01] <%TheWinged7> can you put the donations above you and you in the corner?
[0:16:05] <%topendbuzza> delete pat Kappa
[0:16:07] <jackelzxaa> time to go meet your old friend nasanna dantias
[0:16:09] <%Ranryu692> how high you're floating is bugging MY mind goblins LUL
[0:16:11] <jorniev> CAN you make yourself transparent?
[0:16:16] <jackelzxaa> i think this next cutscene was one of the first things from me2 they ever showed
[0:16:17] <Pookiedaexzile> Tali and Garrus as a Team doesn't seem like they'll play off eachother much
[0:16:17] <%tebari> Old layout caused image retention on my iPad. So I prefer this.
[0:16:20] <%Dfreddy8> Now you're just missing Green Screen
[0:16:21] <%DianaTheAscian> so it's like Pats farting donos?
[0:16:23] <%twistedj3ster> Favorite member
[0:16:23] <williamrooster> I love how every news vid about batarians is something evil they did
[0:16:25] <James_Quivers> TAILS AND GARY
[0:16:31] <%topendbuzza> oof
[0:16:34] <%Fooguwu> they meant ABOVE you
[0:16:34] <Alzero83> Choose Again and CHosoe Wisely
[0:16:35] <+TheBitingIrish> HA
[0:16:36] <%Garthunox> Did i miss the end of last stream? I guess i did cos i was expecting you to go talk to Liara
[0:16:40] <%DianaTheAscian> oh boy
[0:16:43] <$RealThiele> game: but for real tho are you suuuuure?
[0:16:49] <+Ghufufin> Batarian are bad no exceptions
[0:16:49] <%Ranryu692> Time to get that thussy
[0:16:49] <Josef_Stryker> No one in the galaxy likes Batarians besides Batarians
[0:16:52] <tattleworm> thane's kisses are hallucinogenic
[0:16:52] <James_Quivers> I love his weird frog voice,
[0:16:55] <%Dfreddy8> The lower mouth Kappa
[0:16:56] <%topendbuzza> having pat burnt on too your Ipat LUL
[0:16:57] <ScreamLord> Are you SURE you want to bring the unhinged ex-cop and the sickly computer nerd?
[0:16:57] <Pookiedaexzile> Thane and Tali on the other hand
[0:16:58] <%Dakuu75> WTF IS THIS SPACE NOISE
[0:16:59] <stantheman_97> kiss his fat reptile lips
[0:17:01] <%Monkeyweed21> HE SWEATS DRUGS TAHTS HOT
[0:17:02] <%ape_hawk> you think thane makes his tongue vibrate like his voice when he french kisses?
[0:17:04] <%athuramn> yeah most streamers cause image retention, this is far more preferable
[0:17:06] <$SGrim> Get high of kissing Thane? PogChamp
[0:17:06] <+wmeldrum> man they had to make "hot fish dude" even hotter with thane
[0:17:08] <%dd44dostivei> illium has socialized cars
[0:17:11] <%tebari> No worries, it is an old iPad. :)
[0:17:15] <jackelzxaa> pat you've probably never done this but if you take miranda to the final boss and blow up the base, the illusive man tells miranda to kill you and she tells him to fuck off and hangs up on him mid call
[0:17:21] <+Ancopro> this reminds me of the parasite eve car
[0:17:30] <%twistedj3ster> I hope you push that one guy

[0:18:51] <%StaceMcGate> there is an upgrade in this area
[0:18:54] <%TheWinged7> psaGoblin
[0:18:54] <%bassoontyphoon> Did you nearly poop yourself?
[0:18:57] <tanarath> Upgrade guide
[0:18:57] <Pookiedaexzile> He could have missed something
[0:18:57] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> LUL

[0:19:28] <$RealThiele> take that, exploration!
[0:19:29] <%topendbuzza> you ok pat?
[0:19:30] <Virokwet> is it really so easy to miss stuff?
[0:19:30] <%AzureGale> Damn you, muscle memory
[0:19:35] <SaltyAzteca> @DianaTheAscian Aw no I saw that. All good Kappa b
[0:19:42] <%Ranryu692> I used to love vanguard in ME3 MP
[0:19:45] <%hat_under_bread> I remember looking at the floor textures on this level for a dumb amount of time. I wonder if the anti-slip dots are still way more detailed than everything else.
[0:19:47] <%twistedj3ster> it's almost like this game has bad control mapping
[0:19:55] <ScreamLord> Cryo Ammo is only good for Biotic Barriers
[0:19:56] <Pookiedaexzile> Ice is bad for robit
[0:20:01] <Pookiedaexzile> But good for ME2
[0:20:11] <stevebahere> How is everything in Quebec Pat @PatStaresAt
[0:20:16] <Broken_Sonex> Cyro Ammo is pretty.....COOL
[0:20:17] <+TheBitingIrish> What are the chances that Pat is using the same GameFAQs guide that 90% of us used back in 2010?
[0:20:23] <TourettesPlays> Explodey Combat Drone is SO GOOD
[0:20:24] <%Ranryu692> I hope they do bring back the ME3 MP, I miss it so much
[0:20:24] <+ryuguitarfreak> Cryo is great
[0:20:36] <%doc_ock_rokc> IT does its called not going tclose
[0:20:50] <+TheBitingIrish> Does LE not have ME3 MP? Wtf, that was the best part
[0:20:52] <Pookiedaexzile> ME2 is great
[0:20:53] <Alzero83> you wish real life had invisible walls?
[0:20:59] <tolloponik> we do have that its call guard rails and common sense...
[0:21:06] <Kain5707> but so did you
[0:21:10] <James_Quivers> thicker, juicier
[0:21:16] <Pookiedaexzile> The lightning isn't as bad as the screen shots show
[0:21:17] <+JonathLP> Louder more accurate time machine?
[0:21:23] <%topendbuzza> nice sorry
[0:21:27] <Josef_Stryker> Re-releases are always great to have. Unless it's Silent Hill
[0:21:29] <%ape_hawk> "I'm sorry" (Who did this to you, and why)
[0:21:30] <+Buzzkill983> Quatar Olympics
[0:21:31] <$RealThiele> you are gonna die dude
[0:21:32] <AluxStreams> Dat Salarian nosebleed
[0:21:32] <%Dakuu75> I like the Morts from R&C more
[0:21:33] <%Tman451> the texture work is awesome, cant wait to play it myself
[0:21:34] <Broken_Sonex> @James_Quivers succulent even
[0:21:45] <TourettesPlays> Better than that ME Trilogy boxset that doesnt include any of the DLC
[0:21:47] <%DianaTheAscian> why do you have poop on your face?
[0:21:48] <SaltyAzteca> :(
[0:21:52] <%walternatorz> this guy is a bit melodramatic
[0:21:54] <James_Quivers> It's fine, this salarian is like 38, he was gonna die soon anyway
[0:21:57] <+JonathLP> The dogs or the bees or the dogs with the bees in their mouths?
[0:21:58] <Pookiedaexzile> When you don't even see the prompt
[0:21:59] <SaltyAzteca> The gel will ease the pain
[0:22:12] <Radioactive_Jam > why would anyone not help him
[0:22:12] <Pookiedaexzile> No letting a person die is option 2
[0:22:12] <+AmericanSkidd> oh, just in time for Salarians bleeding to death
[0:22:14] <%StaceMcGate> "you think I'm made of medi-gel?"
[0:22:15] <Pookiedaexzile> neutral
[0:22:17] <ScreamLord> Medi-Gel is broken
[0:22:19] <%dekkitout> Wouldnt renegade just kill him because "lol"
[0:22:20] <AluxStreams> Renegade has no reason to specifically let him die.
[0:22:23] <%saiyanblitz> Hi
[0:22:28] <%walternatorz> he's salarian, he's going to die tomorrow anyways
[0:22:28] <%JamesCorck> The fact that Nasana doesn't give a shit about the Salarians is horrific. She's an Asari and can live for literally milennia, and she treats these poor guys who can live (at best) 40 years, like they are garbage. Nasana is a horrible monster in all the levels.
[0:22:30] <+megaman_sentinel> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[0:22:30] <jorniev> renegade is just walk away
[0:22:30] <Profmcstevie> I'm not spending GEL on these fucking frogs, Renegade
[0:22:32] <%Valdorick> No, neutral Sheperd watches people die when he can help.
[0:22:32] <tanarath> The gel will stop bleeding & legit heal you
[0:22:33] <%QueequegTheater> Bruh you think this medigel is free
[0:22:35] <%ape_hawk> if salarians have increased metabolism, shouldnt he be dying faster?
[0:22:36] <stantheman_97> well the prompts are about taking action
[0:22:42] <%AncelDeLambert> this part is a sniper gallery and I LOVE IT
[0:22:48] <Broken_Sonex> If you don't press the Paragon interrupt you just watch him slowly die
[0:22:48] <knight_verse> THE RENEGADE PROMPT SHOULD BE YOU ASKING HIM TO PAY YOU TO HEAL HIM.
[0:22:49] <%Nobrev> the renegade and paragon stuff in ME2 feels switched around pretty often
[0:22:51] <%AncelDeLambert> snipe snipe snipe snipe
[0:22:54] <%juxtest> "Give me a cure for the genophage if you want this medi-gel"
[0:22:55] <%ComfortableStranger> Nassana is in ME1 if you remember
[0:22:55] <+wmeldrum> yeah you know when you can't feel your legs and then you rub some neosporin on them and you're fine?
[0:23:00] <%AncelDeLambert> just delete the fucking robots before they even see you
[0:23:03] <blue8moon> this guy has an old-man voice
[0:23:12] <%muetank> muetank subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months! Yay 9 months! Hope Elmo and the good boy/Slime familiar Zangief are doing well.
[0:23:21] <%StaceMcGate> you actually won'tPat
[0:23:21] <%QueequegTheater> Someone will
[0:23:23] <SaltyAzteca> OH!
[0:23:23] <%twistedj3ster> (you won't tho)
[0:23:23] <%bassoontyphoon> That’s rough buddy
[0:23:24] <Pookiedaexzile> THat dude must have been pushing 40
[0:23:24] <%dekkitout> He is salarian, so he could be an old man
[0:23:33] <SaltyAzteca> I remember what happens!
[0:23:42] <Pookiedaexzile> Fire Works better on the Robi
[0:23:50] <%JohnAtDawn> Tali?
[0:23:53] <+Punchasaur> Do salarians even know what dogs are
[0:23:55] <%HanbaobaoZaiNar> make da orb
[0:23:56] <%QueequegTheater> Why is Grunt not in your party >:(
[0:24:05] <%ape_hawk> look, tali! a robot! you love those, right?!?!

[0:51:30] <%Gloom_Tangerine> @patstaresat how do you feel about them taking out the ass shots and removing the “sexy” aspects of the game while not touching the representation of autistic people in overlord?
[0:51:32] <DSD24> Viper is pretty good
[0:51:34] <%skeleklng> Incisior better for squad mates
[0:51:35] <%Taisuru> Likely
[0:51:35] <%QueequegTheater> My 2 may have killed her
[0:51:36] <thelonechris> Is Paige kill?
[0:51:36] <tattleworm> viper's just an assault rifle
[0:51:37] <jackelzxaa> the incisor is burst fire but the viper is rapid fire

[0:52:28] <$RealThiele> "drop"
[0:52:34] <%ape_hawk> salarians are named after the latin word for "war crimes"
[0:52:35] <James_Quivers> Asari are called that because they got ncie asses

[0:52:40] <%walternatorz> elmo ate all the poison before

[0:52:52] <%Ranryu692> IT'S SUPER BAD
[0:52:57] <fugly_nick> The Autistic stuff in Overlord is so bad
[0:53:01] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt It's not super great, but it could be a lot worse
[0:53:05] <tanarath> OH BOY PAT'S GONNA HAVE FUN
[0:53:08] <dinnydanny777> yeah
[0:53:08] <huskarl_zap> More newtypes? damn
[0:53:09] <thetunnelhomer> The Autistic things in overlord is overblown.
[0:53:13] <%maenos2> I mean ones camera angles the other is story stuff and would need more of a change
[0:53:17] <Profmcstevie> Mass Effect has been fucking across the species always, why deny it
[0:53:17] <fugly_nick> At least it's not Predator bad
[0:53:21] <tattleworm> i wouldn't call overlord distateful or anything, it's just real uncomfortable
[0:53:21] <%Gloom_Tangerine> @patstaresat oh it’s bad
[0:53:25] <+PerrinIsDead> BOOOOO
[0:53:29] <+PerrinIsDead> BRIBG BACK THE SEX
[0:53:33] <Psyramics> every Miranda-focused scene had at least one close-in shot of her ass
[0:53:34] <aiutare47> The overlord writing makes zero sense and it talks about autism like its magic that turns you into a robot?
[0:53:35] <+PerrinIsDead> BOOOO KEEP THE AUTISM AND SEX
[0:53:35] <%Mr_Pylon> it's real bad
[0:53:35] <%tank7013> Are we talking David Cage fucked up or The Predator fucked up?
[0:53:36] <stantheman_97> is it like "autism is a super power" thing?
[0:53:37] <%skeleklng> It's just "haha autistic people are actually super-geniuses"
[0:53:41] <%JohnAtDawn> Yep
[0:53:42] <aiutare47> YEP
[0:53:42] <%Taisuru> Show butt
[0:53:42] <+Buzzkill983> It was integral the autistic child needed to be fucked up
[0:53:43] <%Ranryu692> IT'S EXACTLY THAT
[0:53:43] <DSD24> uh
[0:53:43] <fugly_nick> It's exactly that
[0:53:44] <stormhawk9891> WORSE
[0:53:45] <LeotheHuntsman> literally that
[0:53:45] <+AmericanSkidd> super fucked up depiction is not incorrect

[0:53:50] <hairtoday> yeah, nailed it
[0:53:51] <$RealThiele> if it worked for rainman itll work for us!
[0:53:51] <$hattrick61> waaaaaàaat no
[0:53:52] <peachy996> Nailed it
[0:53:52] <%MidnightBurst12> correct
[0:53:53] <thetunnelhomer> It's not though
[0:53:54] <%tank7013> Predator it is
[0:53:54] <SociopathicApe> Right on the nose, Pat
[0:53:55] <%Monkeyweed21> LITERALLY THAT
[0:53:56] <Josef_Stryker> Basically Geth Rainman
[0:53:58] <%Torus1025> You got it right
[0:54:01] <stantheman_97> fucking god
[0:54:02] <Afterman_> fuck that
[0:54:03] <tanarath> EXACTLY THAT BUT CERBERUS MAD SCIENCE
[0:54:04] <$hattrick61> rainman + matrix
[0:54:04] <+wmeldrum> it's evolution?
[0:54:05] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Thats...Not how I remember the DLC. At all
[0:54:05] <%CommanderSqueaks> Excuse me?
[0:54:06] <%Mr_Pylon> wait what
[0:54:07] <%BigCoffee> what!?
[0:54:08] <thetunnelhomer> But it not from whatt I remember
[0:54:08] <SaltyAzteca> Thanks Ridley Scott Kappa
[0:54:08] <+PerrinIsDead> Cancel culture really fucked up my god damn but shots these games are trash now
[0:54:08] <%tank7013> They needed to inject themselves with Autism
[0:54:09] <falyden> Shane black took notes it seems
[0:54:09] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat excuse me?
[0:54:10] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Rain Man, but badly written
[0:54:10] <DanThePumpkinman> No!?
[0:54:11] <Dabrikishaw> Overlord's ending it good, but it does rely on dated writing
[0:54:12] <%Eilocke> now that i've actually played Overlord, it's pretty damn dumb
[0:54:16] <ScreamLord> Aliens came to steal our autism
[0:54:16] <%Ranryu692> it's a cool mission until the magic autism
[0:54:18] <%BigCoffee> what do you mean autims?
[0:54:18] <+TheBitingIrish> No, wtf
[0:54:19] <Pookiedaexzile> They still have a evil race, a fuck race, and a Race that's made to be hated, I think these are the least of this games problems
[0:54:19] <%Maids4lyfe> he's also being tortured too
[0:54:22] <%Mr_Pylon> was that the last Predator movie?!
[0:54:22] <%AzureGale> SQUEK
[0:54:23] <%CommanderSqueaks> Jesus fuck
[0:54:23] <peachy996> You can thank Rain Man for all these great autistic portayals
[0:54:23] <%demiiluna> It's no more offensive than rainman imo. I just rolled my eyes really.
[0:54:25] <+wmeldrum> Predator: On the Spectrum
[0:54:27] <Afterman_> EVERYONE GO READ THE RECENT  PREDTOR COMICS, AND THE OMNIBUS!A thats the best pred has been in a LONG time
[0:54:29] <%saiyanblitz> Y’all talking about the anime overlord with the skeleton dude
[0:54:31] <+Buzzkill983> I like the Paragon action at the end.
[0:54:33] <Pookiedaexzile> Oh  yeah being Austic gives you Predator powers
[0:54:33] <%BigCoffee> predator hasn't been good since predator 2
[0:54:34] <Afterman_> OMNIBUS****
[0:54:35] <williamrooster> they should just stick with made up space mental illnesses
[0:54:35] <dinnydanny777> didn't Shane Black cast a sex predator and not tell anybody
[0:54:35] <%CommanderSqueaks> SQUEEEEAK
[0:54:35] <%AzureGale> PLAY WITH ME FATHER
[0:54:35] <blue8moon> I was told this, and yes, it is big dumb
[0:54:35] <%QueequegTheater> IT STINK
[0:54:36] <James_Quivers> The guy is actually a savant but they call it autism instead, really just an issue of labelling it incorrectly
[0:54:36] <$RealThiele> ive given up on new predator content
[0:54:38] <%Taisuru> FLORP
[0:54:40] <tattleworm> the main thing i remember from overlord is the body horror pipe mouth thing
[0:54:40] <%dekkitout> Predators wanted to harvest human autism to improve their Predatorness I guess
[0:54:40] <fugly_nick> The reason Predator's take spines is so they can extract Autism fluid so they can evolve
[0:54:43] <Afterman_> lmao at that misspelling
[0:54:46] <Pookiedaexzile> And turns you into IronPredator
[0:54:47] <Josef_Stryker> Did Rainman popularize the "super autistic" trope?
[0:54:49] <tanarath> Toys need to be washed, pat
[0:54:51] <$hattrick61> THE ILLUSIVE MAN IS STEALING OUR AUTISIM
[0:54:52] <%Eilocke> they kept referring to the benefits of his "autistic mind"
[0:54:52] <knight_verse> Possibly both are written by people that know each other.
[0:54:54] <SmolBluGhost> Peperidge farms remembers
[0:54:57] <%bassoontyphoon> WutFace WutFace WutFace
[0:54:58] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Josef_Stryker Yes
[0:55:01] <+robosqueeb> the kid makes predator suicide after forcing him to look at all his sonic merch
[0:55:02] <thehullowed> !uptime
[0:55:02] <%walternatorz> the koala fur is a natural carrier of the dog druel
[0:55:02] <+AmericanSkidd> its more offensive what they do to the guy
[0:55:02] <@Moobot> @thehullowed I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 55m 22s.
[0:55:06] <DSD24> This part is great
[0:55:09] <aiutare47> He can speak to geth, because hes autistic. He can speak, with his vocal cords, to the robots that talk with data, because he got autism.
[0:55:14] <MasterTonberry23> smells better than you in the morning pat
[0:55:15] <%Maids4lyfe> Predator can see on all spectrums except the autism spectrum psaDab
[0:55:15] <$RealThiele> blow the bridge lady?
[0:55:15] <%Gloom_Tangerine> No it’s more like, a guy is using his autistic brother as a computer to communicate with the geth and torturing him.
[0:55:27] <James_Quivers> GO FOR THE EYES
[0:55:29] <Pookiedaexzile> You also get Preador Mechs in that movie that fit Human children
[0:55:29] <%Taisuru> Never saw me cummin
[0:55:31] <knight_verse> I mean, Picard is basically just Mass Effect 1 but worse...
[0:55:34] <Josef_Stryker> GO FOR THE OPTICS
[0:55:39] <AluxStreams> Garrus "Drop your shield! Perfect!"
[0:55:40] <%valriot> IMPRESSIVE
[0:55:47] <fugly_nick> Were they wrong?
[0:55:49] <%dekkitout> Maybe the older ones?
[0:55:50] <$hattrick61> plug rainman into the matrix
[0:55:51] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt They are, for 23 and a half hours a day
[0:55:51] <$RealThiele> hes young
[0:55:51] <+robosqueeb> I like this arc of zangief sabotaging pats livelihood
[0:55:52] <James_Quivers> Older ones are, not the younguns
[0:55:53] <Profmcstevie> They are lazy.....eventually
[0:55:56] <%king_wragles> And cats should eat their own hair, but here we are
[0:55:56] <%QueequegTheater> those other 30 tho
[0:55:57] <%Monkeyweed21> HES A PUPPY
[0:55:59] <%Dfreddy8> Well he is only barely a year old
[0:55:59] <DSD24> Wow that lady got hit by her allies
[0:56:01] <+AmericanSkidd> aw she got hit by her own guy
[0:56:02] <%Maids4lyfe> bulldogs are high maintenance
[0:56:04] <Pookiedaexzile> He only DEMANDS BATTLE for like 20 minutes and then passes out
[0:56:05] <%ape_hawk> stop drip-feeding zangief your redbulls and MAYBE he'll calm down
[0:56:07] <flexwing_> zangiefs a genetic FREAK
[0:56:14] <$Ziegsy> someone told me akitas are hard work. Mine just sleeps all day and only plays with her toys when she needs to poop
[0:56:18] <%Maids4lyfe> bulldogs get lazy after 6 years
[0:56:27] <%Taisuru> Tell garrus to shoot them
[0:56:31] <%shurtal> Man, this section really feels like American Gladiators
[0:56:34] <%tank7013> I wonder why they decided to have multiple levels where you go through a mercenary gauntlet while someone on a loudspeaker yells at them to kill you better

[0:57:28] <jackelzxaa> in the PC version of ME1 you were actually able to do really complex squad commands like put garrus behind cover and then mark targets for him.  it was really cool

[1:11:48] <Jaysky> MORDIN? Hell no, time to move onto the next mission. :)
[1:11:49] <%Valdorick> REMINDER KELLY FUCKED A SPACE DOG AND SPRED SPACE STIs ACROSS THE SHIP
[1:11:50] <+Buzzkill983> Kelly stop trying to bang the crew. That's Shepherd's job
[1:11:50] <Pookiedaexzile> She looks like that chick from Life is Strange
[1:11:51] <%QueequegTheater> *implied
[1:11:53] <+RelikaNox> first the roll, now the paper
[1:11:53] <%bassoontyphoon> Jesus that’s vomit worthy
[1:11:53] <+trackles_64> paper tpwels are delicious
[1:11:54] <%bread_assassin> Is there any skill that benefits from the area upgrade over the damage upgrade? I went with the latter pretty much 100% of the time.
[1:11:54] <James_Quivers> Kelly si jsut your average female ME fan, IRL, really
[1:11:55] <%Shubreaker> love how Kelly and Shepard totally gossip about who they want to fuck more
[1:11:55] <%dekkitout> Those are totally digestible
[1:11:56] <+PerrinIsDead> Oh doesn’t kelly get fucked later on
[1:12:02] <$hattrick61> Jacob chart is as follows ME3 kaiden > James > ME1 kaiden > Jenkins > Jacob
[1:12:03] <%SaphronBlackbourne> I don't understand how Thane is sexy and I'm gay af
[1:12:06] <morningmoondude> so like, Garrus lays eggs in you, right?
[1:12:11] <%maenos2> @perrinisdead if you aren't fast yeah
[1:12:17] <xhodocto385> but does Kelly like bizarre eldritch nonhumanoid aliens?
[1:12:19] <%Valdorick> @PerrinIsDead If you're slow to get to the last mission, yeah.
[1:12:21] <xhodocto385> doesn't matter maybe
[1:12:22] <knight_verse> are you guys nou feeding the dog or something?
[1:12:23] <DSD24> @Strigiform If you are renegade she says how a Bad Boy would easily describe Shepard
[1:12:27] <aiutare47> @morningmoondude they give birth to live young
[1:12:29] <knight_verse> *not
[1:12:31] <%QueequegTheater> @hattrick61 James > both Kaidans
[1:12:34] <SaltyAzteca> Oh no Pat has disappeared
[1:12:37] <+AmericanSkidd> Why are we so sure it was Kelly who fucked a space fish dog, and not someone else?
[1:12:39] <%Valdorick> She fucks a space dog. I think she'd be fine going down on a Shaggoth
[1:12:42] <%Ranryu692> I still can't believe LE gave Kelly a White Uhura hairstyle
[1:12:45] <%SaphronBlackbourne> James is gr8
[1:12:45] <peachy996> @SaphronBlackbourne Sexy Lizardfishman with soft lips and a nice voice
[1:12:46] <morningmoondude> Kelly absolutely is into tentacles
[1:12:51] <xhodocto385> Dog is called Zangief?, SF fan PogChamp

[1:13:21] <$Solid_Stro> This is some quality entertainment
[1:13:25] <aiutare47> @QueequegTheater james has no character either. Unless occasional spanish and being an N7 is backstory. Kaiden was trained by a pirate, until eventually killing his master in a fit of rage.
[1:13:28] <%QueequegTheater> @SaphronBlackbourne he's a single dad with a terminal illness, giant soulful eyes and soft lips

[1:14:44] <%SaphronBlackbourne> Garrus is so cute I kiss him
[1:14:49] <jackelzxaa> very minor thing but kind of neat
[1:14:49] <ioci2112> the mission where people use thermal clips even if they were stranded in a desert planet for 10 years, yeah

[1:21:41] <%demiiluna> @TourettesPlays One of the Asari I think comments that humans can't even sort out their own religions so presumably there are a few still kicking.

[1:26:37] <huskarl_zap> No
[1:26:38] <$BlackMage66652> Fat pigdog noises
[1:26:38] <TourettesPlays> Pat spin in circles to fix Shepards dumb bobblehead

[1:27:04] <stantheman_97> kasumi is a shipper
[1:27:04] <tattleworm> kasumi's the type of girl who ships her friends together
[1:27:05] <%CommanderSqueaks> Kasumi is such a gremlin. I love her.

[1:48:00] <xhodocto385> andromeda DansGame
[1:48:02] <peachy996> Andromeda is okay except for the reasons why you would want to play Mass Effect ie the story and characters
[1:48:03] <+Buzzkill983> Andromeda is a C+ game, but it's in Mass Effect series so it feels worse

[1:58:23] <+Punchasaur> @queequegtheater I haven’t :p
[1:58:27] <ioci2112> @TourettesPlays morinth literally tries to kill 5 SECONDS after you meet her, why would you ever trust her over a super dedicated warrior monk who is super devoted to you and your mission
[1:58:30] <+JonathLP> Samara is voiced by Maggie Baird, Billie Eilish's mom
[1:58:31] <peachy996> You got 1 day, bitch.
[1:58:33] <%StaceMcGate> did they downsize her boobs? I think I remember them being ridiculous
[1:58:34] <+RaveBV> Why is one of her eyes like that???  sbfpSetIn
[1:58:36] <arkv01> why does the justicar have to flex all that BOOBA
[1:58:38] <%ape_hawk> is this foreplay
[1:58:40] <%aWanderingKaivo> weirdly specific code there
[1:58:41] <%Monkeyweed21> MAMA CAN I EAT YOUR BLUSSBERRY PIE?

[1:58:46] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Human is Dumb Dumb
[1:58:47] <+trackles_64> you ruined itpat
[1:58:48] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt As far as I can tell, Samara's voice actor has done nothing but this role
[1:58:50] <peachy996> MUH CODE
[1:58:54] <James_Quivers> BASED GRUNT
[1:58:55] <+destro_223> Grunt

[1:59:04] <Pookiedaexzile> BEST SON
[1:59:04] <$LightningLynx89> Grunt is right
[1:59:04] <peachy996> Asari ARE stupid
[1:59:05] <$zyberion626> Morinth has no redeeming qualities, she's an unrepentant serial killer
[1:59:06] <Admiral_PopnFresh> F yeah Grunt
[1:59:07] <%miguelrod777> LUL
[1:59:08] <arkv01> lets make a deal... I give you this dick... thats it
[1:59:10] <xhodocto385> YES SIR GRUNT LUL
[1:59:12] <dinnydanny777> That's Billie Eilish's mum? LUL
[1:59:13] <%Spydurman> that is the Way
[1:59:13] <%hat_under_bread> "Asari are stupid." "Yes."
[1:59:14] <TheIronBrass> Fuck the code
[1:59:17] <+AmericanSkidd> Her VA also cosplays as Samara at cons its pretty cool
[1:59:18] <NeroInfinite> LUL IS GRUTN WRONG THO?
[1:59:19] <arduousScavenger> Grunt Destroys Samar with Facts and Logic
[1:59:20] <$Solid_Stro> Thanks Grunt
[1:59:21] <Archmortal> "You're right Grunt, Asari are stupid"
[1:59:22] <BurdRightsActivist> @James_Quivers What is grunt based on? Being a Krogan?
[1:59:25] <Jaysky> They're just some cars
[1:59:25] <+trackles_64> Asari dont wear bras?
[1:59:26] <iosephe> Tell me about justicars
[1:59:28] <TourettesPlays> @TourettesPlays Samara is a psychopath who wants to kill and uses Justicar code to justify it. She HAS to kill these cops who have no desire to fight her. Why not just use Stasis?
[1:59:29] <James_Quivers> Also Samara basically said 'Yeah, we are pretty stupid;
[1:59:29] <fugly_nick> Grunt is the smartest one in this room
[1:59:31] <%ItalianWaifu> some armor is right
[1:59:32] <%dekkitout> Weapons are the way, got it
[1:59:32] <Huntercd> Sisters of Battle?
[1:59:34] <Broken_Sonex> GRUNT IS SO FUCKING BASED
[1:59:36] <%juxtest> Is that armor?
[1:59:38] <@commanderclaw> Ah, Paladins
[1:59:40] <dinnydanny777> Just e cars
[1:59:41] <xhodocto385> Morinth was an ardat yakshi, they are the most dangerous Asari
[1:59:41] <DSD24> Based on red pills
[1:59:44] <Pookiedaexzile> "So I can Bust inside, Free and clear?"
[1:59:44] <%Varlinator> Samara > > > Benezia
[1:59:45] <tonfirean> Asari are too feminist for bras
[1:59:45] <Reverend_Godshyne> This game has so many random but notable VA's like Carrie-Anne Moss (The Matrix) and Jim Cummings (Winnie the Pooh)
[1:59:47] <BurdRightsActivist> @Broken_Sonex On?
[1:59:48] <%Mr_Pylon> Lawful Neutral D&D Paladin
[1:59:53] <%QueequegTheater> @TourettesPlays no
[1:59:54] <%maenos2> isn't this an asari planet though?
[1:59:54] <%aWanderingKaivo> @trackles_64 biotics LUL
[1:59:58] <zhenthrim213> so Lawful Stupid
[2:00:02] <%QueequegTheater> Morinth is a vampire serial killer
[2:00:05] <$hattrick61> BRAS ARE AGAINST THE CODE
[2:00:06] <%ItalianWaifu> COMPELLED
[2:00:14] <Broken_Sonex> @Broken_Sonex On Wrex
[2:00:18] <%DashXero> She's assuming a lot...
[2:00:19] <Pookiedaexzile> Samara> Asari
[2:00:24] <+Punchasaur> Asari tiddies don’t sag for hundreds of years
[2:00:25] <dinnydanny777> What a hero
[2:00:29] <%Ravioli_Ronin> Lmao this is the worst
[2:00:32] <+AmericanSkidd> Bras are a human construct
[2:00:37] <%ape_hawk> make an oath to deez nuts
[2:00:42] <xhodocto385> COP CODE LUL
[2:00:47] <+QuesoFM> what was the surprise?
[2:00:50] <xhodocto385> do cops have oaths
[2:00:53] <James_Quivers> "My path is slow and stupid, therefore making it correct"
[2:00:55] <peachy996> It is rather odd that the asari government is like "whoaaa don't fuck with her"
[2:00:55] <%Ravioli_Ronin> Justicar Candice
[2:00:56] <%BigCoffee> those are some high cheek bones
[2:00:58] <$hattrick61> Asari use lift on their boobs
[2:00:59] <TourettesPlays> Justicar code is actually really poorly defined and has a lot of wiggle room
[2:01:01] <ioci2112> @TourettesPlays maybe, but morinth is literally a psychopath serial killer, and recruiting her makes 0 sense even for a renegade shepard, it's completely stupid in the context of the mission, maybe samara will turn against you later, maybe she does some shit you disagree with, morinth is literally a psychopath who was trying to murder you 5 seconds ago
[2:01:01] <%QueequegTheater> @ape_hawk it's implied that you can make her do that
[2:01:02] <Pookiedaexzile> She doesn't need a Bra, she's a Biotic
[2:01:10] <Broken_Sonex> @Punchasaur In fact they become more plump and perky with age
[2:01:12] <$Ziegsy> that seemed really contrived
[2:01:12] <+Punchasaur> You only need a bra in high gravity anyway
[2:01:13] <%Ranryu692> @AmericanSkidd Lucas said there's no underwear in space
[2:01:20] <%CommanderSqueaks> Biotics don't need bras.
[2:01:23] <Chaos_Aether> she seems nice
[2:01:27] <peachy996> KILL ELNORA
[2:01:30] <James_Quivers> @TourettesPlays Only reason to get Morinth is for that MORUSSY
[2:01:32] <Jaysky> @TourettesPlays But she cute
[2:01:34] <aiutare47> MERC HER
[2:01:36] <+trackles_64> you really dont need a guide pat

[2:01:44] <arkv01> sheps going to enjoy breaking her in...
[2:01:44] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt It is morally justified to kill Elnora
[2:01:44] <%AzureGale> SQUEK
[2:01:46] <TourettesPlays> @TourettesPlays Galaxy is better off without all of them so trade Samara for Morinth and let Morinth get killed by cerberus
[2:01:48] <chancho4tierra> How old is Samara? matron or matriarch
[2:01:49] <%CommanderSqueaks> @TourettesPlays You mean the MORUSSY that kills you?
[2:01:53] <medoodoo> liara is way cuter and not crazy
[2:01:54] <peachy996> Do not believe Elnora's Lies when you meet her
[2:01:57] <TioXyco> @Pookiedaexzile Boobieotic
[2:01:57] <+destro_223> Samara tells Renegade Shep that she would fight him after the suicide mission. Morinth wouldn't
[2:01:58] <+trackles_64> kill her
[2:01:59] <$Futurecity10> She's a bitch
[2:02:00] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Kill her, trust me
[2:02:02] <%StaceMcGate> Is the sex with Morinth even good? It sounds like instant pain and death
[2:02:02] <aiutare47> It is a moral imperative pat
[2:02:05] <%Monkeyweed21> So would it be BlueBlussy Pie?
[2:02:06] <%miguelrod777> kill her

[2:04:10] <%aWanderingKaivo> I love the volus in ME3 multiplayer
[2:04:10] <%ClericOfSparda> WOW That escalated quickly
[2:04:11] <Profmcstevie> n-nothing dad

[2:04:24] <$zyberion626> if you knocked a volus down the stairs, would they bounce?
[2:04:39] <xhodocto385> same reason as lack of hanar and elcor squadmates
[2:04:40] <%DashXero> Break his suit.
[2:04:45] <$SGrim> @CommanderSqueaks a Volus riding an Elcor, while operating a turret on the Elcor's back.
[2:04:47] <+Punchasaur> Use him to practice your dunks
[2:04:54] <James_Quivers> I hope ME4 lets you have a squad of jus the loser races, so just Volus, Hanar, Vorcha, ETC
[2:04:55] <xhodocto385> where are my nonhumanoid teams
[2:04:56] <%CommanderSqueaks> @SGrim Deal
[2:05:02] <+AmericanSkidd> @zyberion626 they would for a few steps, then POP
[2:05:05] <Pookiedaexzile> @SGrim That's just The Podcast
[2:05:14] <peachy996> There's nothing as limiting for the Volus like the Elcor or Hanar. You can play as Volus in ME3 MP
[2:05:14] <+destro_223> all volus are space humpty dumpty
[2:05:19] <slix3431> THis alien reminds me of PAT

[2:05:56] <%CommanderSqueaks> Remember that info Pat.
[2:05:56] <James_Quivers> That point about each sister needing to commit a murder is VERY IMPORTANT to remember for later
[2:06:00] <%aWanderingKaivo> Volus adept in ME3 multiplayer is actually a headshot murder monster and its great
[2:06:09] <xhodocto385> didnt punch him FailFish
[2:06:09] <ConflagrationsGaming> aand then how 'every asari spends her maiden years shakign her ass or being a merc'

[2:11:59] <jackelzxaa> they might as well be wearing monarch butterfly costumes
[2:11:59] <%aWanderingKaivo> @aWanderingKaivo Definitely. Though old ME3's multiplayer still has enough people for regular games surprisingly, at least on PC, I'd lose to see it added to LE
[2:12:26] <%ape_hawk> MIND OVER MATTER
[2:12:33] <crookedfinger68> tryna hit this red sand?
[2:12:35] <%NopeBadguy> is that the eviserator?
[2:12:42] <jackelzxaa> pat do you know if you want to go for the super shotgun or get training for a new gun type later?  (Collector ship)  the mattock is a VERY fun semi auto single shot assault rifle
[2:12:43] <Laecerelius> Get all up in there, Vanguard!!
[2:12:47] <+superstarsage> is it just me or does the melee do more consistent dps than the shotgun
[2:12:51] <stormhawk9891> @NopeBadguy Scimitar

[2:13:32] <peachy996> The mattock is awesome in this game
[2:13:33] <%athuramn> that has to be a bit

[2:13:55] <+AmericanSkidd> sick death dab shepard
[2:13:57] <%miguelrod777> maybe use guns pat
[2:14:19] <peachy996> It's one of the most satisfying to shoot. Not so much in 3 but in 2 the Mattock was king
[2:14:25] <DSD24> I'm ok
[2:14:27] <MasterTonberry23> charge is fun but it can get you killed fast
[2:14:27] <%NopeBadguy> yeah as vanguard the scimitar is really only beaten by the claymore
[2:14:35] <+fetrigon> pretty good :)
[2:14:40] <%aWanderingKaivo> gun pain requires ice
[2:14:41] <DSD24> Hackerman
[2:14:50] <+Punchasaur> Probably shouldn’t keep exposing your back and surrounding yourself

[2:32:24] <%aWanderingKaivo> @42nfl19 well its not tech for all species but not magic either. Asari get it naturally
[2:32:33] <trickquestionz> Thane is not making a good impression on his first mission.
[2:32:35] <Latija> wait does samara not fight in her recruitment mission?
[2:32:38] <Jaysky> @Soliloquy123 Recruited Thane and now Samara. Spoke to Mordin about his loyalty mission but hasn't done anything yet.

[2:32:59] <peachy996> Turians, Krogan, Drell, Volus and Human can biotic.
[2:33:05] <fugly_nick> @42nfl19 It's tech in the sense that there's a scientific explanation behind it either way
[2:33:06] <+AmericanSkidd> @Latija you see her end a fight
[2:33:11] <TurtlesAndTentacles> When did we get THane?
[2:33:14] <%CommanderSqueaks> You literally just passed by the exit
[2:33:16] <%king_wragles> @peachy996 Asari?
[2:33:16] <%QueequegTheater> @42nfl19 Born with it, Asari all got it from their homeworld being juiced up for so long that it's genetic for them now
[2:33:29] <fieriflavortown> Quarians can too but it's extremely rare
[2:33:34] <+TreskM> All Asari are biotic
[2:33:34] <%CommanderSqueaks> But it had the Biotic God

[2:33:42] <Latija> wack mission

[2:33:44] <@PeachSaliva> OMG Pat will you please have dinner!
[2:33:45] <%QueequegTheater> 90% of the mission is her mommy-stomping that Asari
[2:33:46] <haisho> but Niftu Cal
[2:33:47] <peachy996> @king_wragles Besides them. Also Protheans
[2:33:49] <ioci2112> also asari were experimented by the protheans and that probably had something to do with it
[2:33:50] <Latija> its like a lamer thane mission
[2:33:51] <Vikbosss> but Biotic God
[2:33:53] <DSD24> It has a really funny line for Shepard
[2:33:54] <TioXyco> if samara was there, you would do nothing
[2:33:56] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Also you skip part of it too
[2:33:58] <James_Quivers> I find the majority of recruitment missions in this game to be meh
