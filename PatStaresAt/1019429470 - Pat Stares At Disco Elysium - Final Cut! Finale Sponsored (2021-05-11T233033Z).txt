[0:17:32] <%Maids4lyfe> Doesn't waiting that long lower the efficiency?- Oh....
[0:17:40] <Blank9> I legitimately feel like I'm having a full body growth spurt and fever a day after the 2nd shot
[0:17:41] <derap41> Science
[0:17:41] <+JobbedBone> looking for reasons to justify your anger LUL
[0:17:49] <%Pookiedaexzile> So When we in the States go molded well know we shoulda waited

[0:18:05] <+BusterRepukken> the previous Conservative government destroyed all our vaccine facilities in the past, thanks Harper.
[0:18:08] <%toolofparanoia> still wearing my mask despite being vaccinated
[0:18:16] <%nomos42> But the decline is a lot slower after second dose
[0:18:20] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> So, is there combat in DE chat? Or is it all investigative roleplaying?
[0:18:30] <%BinaryFireball> obviously

[0:19:41] <%thbluewarden> what?
[0:19:42] <Profmcstevie> World sourced vaccine, company tried to patent it. Lucky we didn't take their legs
[0:19:43] <Jetsfantasy> Everyone called it with the pharmaceutics pulling this shits last year
[0:19:46] <ingman112> I highly doubt that the people who actually invented the vaccine give a fuck about patents. They want to save lives
[0:19:46] <$lumporr> oh yeah/
[0:19:47] <%Pookiedaexzile> Haha Bill She Took the Vaccine AND THE KIDS

[0:19:50] <Ravioli_Ronin> I hope that’s why he’s getting divorced woolieFABRICATION
[0:19:51] <%BinaryFireball> incentive is to not die
[0:19:53] <Covil91> This conversation is funnily relevant to Disco Elysium
[0:19:53] <%ArchimerCXV> there isn't an incentive for staying ALIVE?
[0:19:53] <derap41> So we hate Gates again?
[0:19:54] <ingman112> The owners, on the other hand...
[0:19:54] <%W1nterTitan> Besides, like not being a dick?
[0:19:54] <iosephe> Bill Gates specifically convinced a university to give the patent rights to some corporation
[0:19:55] <%JoshManVGH> Yeah cause that's worked out so well for Insulin
[0:19:57] <COMB711> but there'd be no incentives for MEEEEEEEEE
[0:19:58] <+upandadam> just substitute the market incentive with public funding
[0:20:00] <twohitgood> there'd be less *monetary* incentive.
[0:20:02] <thelonechris> Get fucked, nerd!
[0:20:03] <%ospreyworks> ALSO EPSTEIN!
[0:20:04] <%nomos42> Cos of eptstein connections
[0:20:04] <%Ranryu692> keeping your customers alive to be future customers is a good idea
[0:20:05] <%Blackleafx> His wife left him because of his ties to Epstein
[0:20:05] <%BinaryFireball> wife left when kids turned 18
[0:20:07] <tanarath> Milinda Gates has been divorcing him since 2019,Pat.

[0:20:55] <$lumporr> idk if that's real, but that'd be GENIUS at that level
[0:20:55] <LunarRemix> That seems like a law specifically made FOR rich people
[0:20:57] <iosephe> Even if he loses half he's still got shitloads of money
[0:20:59] <ingman112> Epstein would be the convenient public reason to give to justify a divorce
[0:21:00] <%BinaryFireball> stock price is still effected he just doesnt have enough to make it super noticeable
[0:21:00] <Jetsfantasy> cut his mic, he knows too much monkaS

[0:37:46] <sirtommygunn> hmm i wonder if that will come up
[0:37:51] <$dalmek> something-something-radio-weapon is hilarious

[0:37:53] <%nomos42> I'm sure that doesn't indicate anything Kappa
[0:37:53] <%purps26> damn I never got that thought
[0:37:56] <RedPlasticCup> thats never gonna come up
[0:38:04] <%nomos42> You have it
[0:38:05] <%Blackleafx> you'll get it pat
[0:38:08] <naoi0> Didn't you already get one or?
[0:38:09] <Daxalog> "Against enemies in armor"?
[0:38:09] <%VyperVic> library for figurine
[0:38:11] <+JustToWatch> pretty sure you bought it already
[0:38:11] <+upandadam> you can still get one
[0:38:12] <Make_me_mad> I love that thought. All the time examining the armor to find a weakness and it's just "No, this shit is GREAT. Good luck."
[0:38:13] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> i think you already bought it
[0:38:16] <%cobalt_phoenix_> you already did
[0:38:16] <%Blackleafx> Yeah i think he has the figurine
[0:38:17] <%Broand> you have a figurine
[0:38:18] <+ReallyBigRocks> You already bought one right?
[0:38:24] <M0untain_wolf> Man this worlds tech is all over the place.
[0:38:24] <NeroInfinite> looking like a real RPG here there
[0:38:31] <%Blackleafx> figurines arent clothes, pat
[0:38:32] <ingman112> He already owns it and I think he tried to offer it already
[0:38:32] <%Blackleafx> :)
[0:38:39] <ingman112> So don't worry about it for now
[0:38:40] <@commanderclaw> @PatStaresAt You should look up what happens if you buy the streetlight after the playthrough
[0:38:53] <+JobbedBone> yes
[0:38:53] <doc_ock_rokc> that dog is sawing logs
[0:38:54] <%purps26> go buy shit from siileng
[0:38:55] <ingman112> Yeah you just need 700 real
[0:38:55] <%holydeviant1> you pretty much have to hack
[0:38:55] <%Blackleafx> In a VERY specific situation
[0:38:56] <naoi0> It's pointless though but yeah, you can
[0:38:56] <@commanderclaw> If you scrimp the whole game
[0:38:56] <%baka_sugoi> 700
[0:39:00] <naoi0> Mostly through cheats
[0:39:00] <%Blackleafx> you need to go ultraliberal
[0:39:00] <%VyperVic> yeah, super hard tho
[0:39:00] <skeletonkingofmanlets> gief thirsty
[0:39:03] <AmuserName> yep!
[0:39:04] <%jorniev> its really funny
[0:39:05] <Daxalog> Is it possible to get kim his rims back?
[0:39:06] <LunarRemix> Yes you can.
[0:39:09] <+JobbedBone> its not hard anymore
[0:39:13] <ingman112> YEEEEE BOOOOIII
[0:39:14] <BerryliciousDefinition> Spend money to make money
[0:39:15] <heysamuel> speedfreaks fm is my favorite subplot
[0:39:15] <RedPlasticCup> it is possible, yes
[0:39:17] <%Blackleafx> Ultraliberal gives you a ton of money from magic light bending guy
[0:39:17] <$Futurecity10> @PatStaresAt Not legit though, you literally cannt make 700 dollars even if you play perfectly. Its literally only for cheaters
[0:39:19] <M0untain_wolf> speed freeeaks
[0:39:20] <%hax_metatron> It’s not a spoiler because it takes huge scrounging to get to 700, but if you buy the light you can’t carry it with you — but gets stored as your assets in that shop
[0:39:20] <xcompleasedad> Full Hobocop with Greed thoughts
[0:39:20] <%Ranryu692> you can get Wompty Dompty Dom on Day 3, and that'll get you a LOT of money
[0:39:24] <+Mucmaster> Honestly its so much money its better to just look up the scene online
[0:39:29] <+Dorf1> youd probably need to go to the light bending rich guy for that money
[0:39:33] <+JobbedBone> @Futurecity10 the update changed things

[1:25:32] <CheesesSliced> @joodatious everyone's an accidental offender when they get caught 🤣
[1:25:44] <aiutare47> @ingman112 Yeah, the lorry driver is almost a crypto, they try and hide it using phrases like "Welcome to Revachol" Gary just yells "Yellow Man!" nothing hidden about that
[1:25:50] <%elhafnero> elhafnero subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 2 month streak! zangief head boop
[1:26:08] <derap41> I see where this is going
[1:26:28] <CheesesSliced> Plot twist: the crypto is Doge. Saw it on SNL
[1:26:41] <derap41> peyote trip anyone?
[1:27:07] <derap41> real talk don't do peyote just do lsd poor plants are risking extinction
[1:27:09] <PartyFavors> ...thanks, reaction speed
[1:27:14] <+HonterThompson> Why is Reaction Speed on the side of the cryptid
[1:27:15] <ingman112> @aiutare47 I think we're saying the same thing. That it's just a fancier word for racist
[1:27:19] <+senfood> Oh, reaction Speed LUL
[1:27:35] <cardamomo88> ?????
[1:27:35] <%Blackleafx> monkaS

[1:27:42] <naoi0> Fuck yes
[1:27:43] <Dr_Mooose> wtf
[1:27:45] <ingman112> @aiutare47 Oh I see the idea is that RLD's fascism is hidden. I dunno that I'd agree with that

[1:28:38] <+PMAvers> I mean, Kim's done that to us with his eyebrows before.
[1:28:41] <FassieFons> even kim thinks it's cool
[1:28:45] <CheesesSliced> I think Pat needs to wear an Indiana Jones IRL hat if he's gonna pursue the crypto quest line
[1:28:56] <aiutare47> @ingman112 yes and no, Mussolini was a fascist but he thought racism was stupid and Hitler was an idiot for focusing too much on race and not enough on nationalist strength. Fascism and racism dont ALWAYS go hand in hand, just usually.
[1:28:56] <derap41> Kim doesn't believe it but that doesn't mean he isn't enjoying it

[1:44:59] <wdga> it counts
[1:45:00] <%CatastropheCorvid> Question. When certain words like Slurs are bleeped, is that a setting within the game, or are they bleeped by default?

[1:46:49] <+kewlmyc> Cuno is cool in my book. Cunoesse sucks though
[1:46:49] <CheesesSliced> So much senseless death, because the Patpopo is lame
[1:46:50] <%jorniev> CUNO is so well written for a crazy character

[1:48:05] <+HonterThompson> @kewlmyc I kind of like Cunoesse- she genuinely cares about Cuno and wants him to turn out better than his dad, but she's basically a feral child and knows no life but violence, so her idea of love and success is warped

[1:54:14] <%bread_assassin> Books can wait. You got a dance club to startup.
[1:54:18] <%toolofparanoia> Then the communists ?
[1:54:18] <+Mucmaster> @xcompleasedad I didn't pay attention to if those books did anything for political alignment but I did notice what characters liked heimdal
[1:54:23] <CheesesSliced> Put the books in your ants for maximum honour

[1:54:37] <Cpt_phantom> My first play through I finished with a lot of money. Might as well spend it
[1:54:38] <$lumporr> no
[1:54:39] <ingman112> I don't think so
[1:54:39] <CheesesSliced> Insert the books into your ants for maximum honour
[1:54:40] <@commanderclaw> You have like 10 days to finish IIRC
[1:54:41] <$lumporr> it is not
[1:54:41] <%Blackleafx> no
[1:54:41] <sirrice77> No
[1:54:43] <heysamuel> nope, you can play as long as you need
[1:54:43] <LunarRemix> You have 10 days total
[1:54:43] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> Nah
[1:54:44] <fedemachado96> nah
[1:54:44] <+mczarklesby> Game won't end until you end it.
[1:54:45] <%VyperVic> nah. you got time
[1:54:46] <bakkatohri> I'm pretty sure it does have a time limit
[1:54:46] <%joodatious> yes
[1:54:47] <UnfilteredComic> nope
[1:54:47] <+JobbedBone> you'll know
[1:54:51] <$lumporr> you have at least another stream to go
[1:54:51] <SomeAsianDood> @Mucmaster @xcompleasedad hjemdall readers are typically racists
[1:54:52] <fedemachado96> the game will ***
[1:54:53] <%za7az> Yes, but you'll see it coming\
[1:54:53] <librettodude> Game progress is event-based
[1:54:53] <%bettysharkface> No, it's pretty well paced
[1:54:54] <+HonterThompson> @PatStaresAt There's no time pressure but certain sidequests become uncompleteable if you take too long or miss their windows
[1:54:55] <donklonker> You got until day 10
[1:54:55] <oda_flobunaga> you need to hit the point of no return by day 8
[1:54:56] <derap41> 10 is the max but times stops after 2am
[1:54:57] <xcompleasedad> @Mucmaster I meant reading ANY books. You can BS all of the questions they ask if you have read ANYTHING
[1:54:57] <CheesesSliced> Anus, damnit
[1:55:00] <Chernobylpp> Yeah you got plenty of time
[1:55:00] <CheesesSliced> Nope
[1:55:03] <fedemachado96> the game will tell you
[1:55:06] <+MrAtheGreat> Don't worry, the game WILL tell you when you're reaching that point
[1:55:08] <CheesesSliced> Just don't use up all your days
[1:55:09] <sirrice77> @PatStaresAt actually the ddays dont proceed until certain events occur
[1:55:14] <$bognugget> you should have more than enough time to do everything
[1:55:16] <$lumporr> wait wtf you have 10 days? holy shit i fuckin' BOOKED it in my playthrough, whoops
[1:55:18] <bakkatohri> @PatStaresAt Be sure not to go to bed every night. You might miss content (night dwelling citizens)
[1:55:18] <+ThomasOfTroy> Sure
[1:55:19] <xcompleasedad> @SomeAsianDood I was referring to books in general
[1:55:21] <CheesesSliced> You have to solve the mystery by day 10
[1:55:22] <remainprofane> It’s basically Conan the Barbarian but more obviously problematic
[1:55:28] <ingman112> Yeah you already tried. No dice
[1:55:28] <+MrAtheGreat> You can reach the point of no return on day 3 iirc
[1:55:31] <%joodatious> the game expects you to do side stuff
[1:55:34] <$bognugget> i love the music in here
[1:55:37] <%hax_metatron> There's a very specific event that the game signals is a point of no return @PatStaresAt
[1:55:38] <derap41> Gonna give a figurine to a painting?
[1:55:38] <SomeAsianDood> fair
[1:55:40] <peyodogo> there was a thread on reddit where someone passed days reading way past the ten day mark tho
[1:55:44] <%Make_me_mad> I finished this on like day 5, I didn't realize how much time you actually have.
[1:55:47] <%Jeshk0> i think i finished my first run in 7 days and can def do it faster
[1:55:50] <peyodogo> huh

[1:55:58] <derap41> Thanks Kim
[1:55:59] <remainprofane> Crazy amount of time
[1:56:06] <CheesesSliced> I finished in day 8 with most side quests done
[1:56:06] <+MrAtheGreat> I did mine in 7

[2:20:13] <%Make_me_mad> The Innocence is literally just an elected dictator who can force the majority opinion onto the rest of the world quickly instead of gradually. It's the Moralist's way of cheating their own ideology to rush change, and they deify the Innocences as an excuse.

[2:42:46] <doc_ock_rokc> He is a modrate probably leaning towards capitalist
[2:42:47] <fedemachado96> h/e coordination
[2:42:48] <digaogrunge> CONCEPT gives you XP
[2:42:50] <%nomos42> Rhetoric could be higher
[2:42:55] <17sevens> savior faire
[2:42:55] <%king_wragles> Could just max Instrument
[2:42:57] <xcompleasedad> Authority is vital for the red check we were talking about ealier
[2:42:58] <%psidefx> 1 Volition?
[2:42:58] <+JobbedBone> rounding yourself out is BORING,
[2:43:00] <+upandadam> empathy is good too
[2:43:01] <%illusiveSaint> drama is great tol
[2:43:01] <Blank9> authority is worth 2
[2:43:02] <%nomos42> @doc_ock_rokc ????
[2:43:03] <%thomassolorio> pain emp hand
[2:43:05] <$hattrick61> H/E and Electro
[2:43:07] <%bevyrage> remember that hand/eye coordination is your GUN stat
[2:43:08] <%jorniev> remember you can change clothes right before the check comes out
[2:43:10] <UnfilteredComic> Empathy, Corps, Hand Eye
[2:43:14] <%illusiveSaint> Max out phys int
[2:43:14] <fedemachado96> although conceptualization gives you xp
[2:43:16] <%Pookiedaexzile> LOGIC IS ODD
[2:43:16] <+MrAtheGreat> Rhetoric is pretty important too
[2:43:20] <%VyperVic> you will want authority
[2:43:22] <Dabrikishaw> 6 encyclopedia
[2:43:26] <+emperri> also yeah pain threshold would be good
[2:43:28] <ingman112> Rhetoric might be good actually
[2:43:34] <xcompleasedad> Yes
[2:43:35] <+emperri> big up
[2:43:35] <+Zombiemowlcher> FEAR

[2:44:01] <wdga> lol
[2:44:01] <%jorniev> dammit
[2:44:02] <+JobbedBone> always put points in what you're already good out. a rounded out cop only protects you from damage and doesn't let you see anything cool
[2:44:04] <%illusiveSaint> h/e
[2:44:04] <+MrAtheGreat> That looks good imo
[2:44:06] <ingman112> Hand eye is fine
[2:44:07] <%psidefx> VoteYea
[2:44:08] <cardamomo88> H/E PAT

[2:57:18] <+emperri> yeah
[2:57:19] <Psyramics> pat needs help getting dressed
[2:57:21] <Tisaric> yeah inventory management really should've gotten some QoL love
[2:57:22] <penitentpendant> They NEED to have a subsection system for this in the sequel
[2:57:23] <%Ranryu692> yeah, there needs to be a drop down menu or something
[2:57:26] <+ThomasOfTroy> I wish they had a "optimize by stat" button
[2:57:27] <ingman112> A mod that sorted clothes automatically would be great
[2:57:29] <%jorniev> INVENTORY SYSTEM and its because the UI
[2:57:33] <+MrAtheGreat> @sirtommygunn TBF you could get it on day 3
[2:57:35] <%linSP> sort by the 4 main stats would be cool
[2:57:36] <%Jeshk0> yeah, clothes management isnt good
[2:57:37] <derap41> You should just drop and wear instead of switching
[2:57:39] <%AzureGale> SOme sort of search, sort, or filter would be great
[2:57:40] <%hax_metatron> You should pick a stat and it auto picks the clothes that max that stat
[2:57:43] <%skizzuto> make sure the stuff you have equipped doesn't lower it too
[2:57:44] <Lelfro> just accept it if you fail, leave it for future playthroughs
[2:57:47] <%illusiveSaint> you can manually drag and drop it but it's wack
[2:57:48] <%Pookiedaexzile> Lol
[2:57:50] <%sunsetdisc0> you dont have the bum cap?
[2:57:50] <%kyh9> Sort it yourself, like an Organized Cop
[2:57:56] <johnchikr> @hax_metatron Yeah that seems like a good idea tbh
[2:58:00] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> oh yeah it's terrible once you have a ton of clothes
[2:58:01] <cardamomo88> JUICEEEEE
[2:58:01] <perfect_disaster> done
[2:58:03] <%kyh9> No
[2:58:05] <%king_wragles> OR, you can NOT let it rock
[2:58:07] <%kyh9> Motorics go DOWN
[2:58:11] <%Pookiedaexzile> Don't let it rock its not worth it
[2:58:14] <+AWKWARDL0SER> What happened to your hat

[2:58:29] <%s_xylocalsingles> i have a confession, whenever Pats skillchecks pop up i always vote to sabotage
[2:58:30] <%Pookiedaexzile> ITS NOT WORTH IT TO LET IT ROCK
[2:58:30] <+emperri> it's honestly not that interesting
[2:58:31] <+AWKWARDL0SER> It’s nothing but a tidbit

[3:12:37] <xcompleasedad> @PatStaresAt There is an interpretation that THIS is what caused his memory loss
[3:12:38] <%jorniev> THIS IS MY FAVORITE QUEST
[3:12:47] <teefpal> Moralism was created to contain the pale

[3:14:54] <laserbeaming> That's the Seven Churches
[3:14:55] <Krisaeron> 7 SISTERS = 7 CHURCHES
[3:14:55] <%sunsetdisc0> thats what the 7 churches were called. the seven sisters
[3:14:56] <Lelfro> lyrics
[3:14:56] <+MrAtheGreat> Seven sistersd was in the lyrics
[3:14:56] <+senfood> This is the best written video game in history.
[3:14:56] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> it's world lore
[3:14:59] <+mczarklesby> 7 sisters = the seven churches, mentioned in the song, built to contain this.
[3:14:59] <cardamomo88> SONG
[3:15:01] <BernieSandworm> what great writing tho
[3:15:01] <WakeUpThrow> This game is fucking GREAT AIN'T IT
[3:15:02] <%Broand> Saint Saenz is where you're standing according to shivers I think
[3:15:02] <+newbroxes> 'Towards those pale cliffs there'
[3:15:02] <derap41> You're having a breakthrough here
[3:15:07] <ZComiX> I would often go there To the tiny church there The smallest church in Sussex Though it once was larger How the rill may rest there Down through the mist there Toward the Seven Sisters Toward those white cliffs there I would ofter stay there In there tiny yard there I have been so glad here Looking forward to the past here But now you are alone None of this matters at all
[3:15:07] <%kyh9> OH GOD
[3:15:08] <+yusefHD> Stranger Things type beat
[3:15:10] <$dalmek> "towards those pale cliffs there" is a LYRIC IN THAT SONG
[3:15:14] <$hattrick61> The murder is probably the least important thing happening in this city.
[3:15:15] <doc_ock_rokc> SO yet again Communism fucked the world
[3:15:15] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> this game is absolutely a mindfuck
[3:15:16] <$lumporr> seven soeurs - the seven churches @PatStaresAt
[3:15:29] <%joodatious> This is unironically better then planescape torment
[3:15:31] <$lumporr> sept soeurs
[3:15:33] <%joodatious> better gameplay too lol
[3:15:34] <%Treuan> It makes EVERYTHING a screw-up around it?
[3:15:34] <%Mr_Pylon> The curse is real!
[3:15:34] <cardamomo88> 1
[3:15:37] <%Mendin> What I expected: Murder mystery. What I got: Eschatology
[3:15:40] <%Blackleafx> So d'yall think that Woolie is gonna dismiss this sidequest too as "flat earth nonsense"? Kappa
[3:15:41] <%jorniev> the church was larger because he was little as a child, seven sisters is how they name  the churches
[3:15:47] <bonebagMEL> The Smallest Church in Sussex by British Sea Power
[3:15:47] <%hax_metatron> Man I imagine Woolie might get pissed off at the arty types in this church.... the payoff is so fucking good, but he is really not rocking with some personality types.
[3:15:47] <ingman112> The curse is ACTUALLY REAL
[3:15:54] <LordOfThePoultry> RETURN THE SLAB
[3:15:57] <$dalmek> the song also has "looking forward to the past" man I NEVER made that connection in my head
[3:15:59] <%Dakuu75> this shit is getting bigger than big-brain... we in some GALAXY-BRAIN shit now
[3:16:05] <%jorniev> yes both of them
[3:16:09] <leinadtonu> I'm not sure if that's true but it may be...
[3:16:10] <Tisaric> the SOURCE OF DOOM
[3:16:13] <+MrAtheGreat> yeah they should probably get a heads up
[3:16:19] <+ShutUpAceyP> did he dance?
[3:16:20] <+emperri> I think "everything is the Pale" is probably the lamest interpretation and find it way more interesting how the characters rush to blame everything on Pale, but ymmv
[3:16:24] <+ShutUpAceyP> did kim dance?
[3:16:29] <%Blackleafx> @hax_metatron he absolutely will lol, did you see him around joyce today

[3:52:58] <Detrius25> monkaS THE WALL
[3:52:58] <johnchikr> ㅜㅐㅐㅐ
[3:53:01] <+HonterThompson> @SGrim It's a fictional slur in a universe with a completely different political dynamic (hence why the devs didn't bleep it out like every other actual slur that appears in the game, like the 'f' slur)
[3:53:02] <johnchikr> nooo*
[3:53:09] <+MrAtheGreat> went from dancing to this
[3:53:09] <+emperri> that's the wall brother
[3:53:10] <+fetrigon> jesus
[3:53:13] <fedemachado96> hold your tonge chat
[3:53:22] <+Smokebanshee> Did Pat get the logic check with Soona in the church?

[3:53:41] <%LeiaSkynoober> @SGrim Not...really
[3:53:42] <+icekept> @Smokebanshee yea
[3:53:42] <+Smokebanshee> coo
[3:53:43] <$SGrim> @SGrim Considering how quick people were on typing out the full slur with zero prompting on what the actual slur was, yes I do find that disgusting.
[3:53:48] <cardamomo88> our people BibleThump
[3:54:04] <Detrius25> monkaS Gov paramilitary
[3:54:18] <johnchikr> Authority is weirdly empathetic today
[3:54:19] <ingman112> @SGrim But it's not...an actual slur. Not on the level of others, at least in our world. Like I'm Asian and I didn't take offense
[3:54:26] <Blank9> You do know the game says the slur and everyone said not to fail on it.
[3:54:28] <+senfood> @SGrim It's so Pat wouldn't actually do it, because he specificallly asked. Calm down.
[3:54:28] <%dankgerald> the order man
[3:54:28] <Brandon__Brando> @sgrim oh boy I just got here what fun did I miss?
[3:54:30] <naoi0> I'm asian too lol
[3:54:31] <teefpal> I'm surprised people wern't banned from chat for that
[3:54:42] <Gawayne2> When I played this part I would have sworn Rene had dialogue for after you discover this
[3:54:47] <%TaifuDragon> I mean it's the most awful thing you can say in the whole game, it's not like you just say "kipt"
[3:54:50] <naoi0> @Brandon__Brando Pat asked about a red failed check which leads to harry shouting a racial slur
[3:54:51] <+HonterThompson> @SGrim it's a fictional anti-Seolite slur that has never in history been used against an actual Japanese person ever
[3:54:52] <%TaifuDragon> You gotta know bruh
[3:54:53] <+rrratbastard> @Brandon__Brando pat just got past a check where if he failed he would've called kim a slur. the pass was so much better tho so phew
[3:54:59] <$SGrim> @senfood No, he asked what happens, not what the slur was.
[3:55:10] <%hax_metatron> LUL
[3:55:12] <johnchikr> I've been called a Yellow Monkey before tbh
[3:55:12] <cardamomo88> stop with the white savior bullshit dude

[3:55:18] <ingman112> Welcome to the average Moralist Massacre
[3:55:20] <johnchikr> Monkey Fucker is pretty close
[3:55:21] <$SGrim> @HonterThompson And that changes what, exactly?
[3:55:21] <+emperri> imagine being so high on being offended on other people's behalf that you get mad about a made-up fantasy slur
[3:55:25] <teefpal> Yeah, he didn't know it what would happen
[3:55:28] <DianaTheAscian> what was that giant face?
[3:55:36] <+MrAtheGreat> + 1 modifier
[3:55:40] <naoi0> @DianaTheAscian What giant face?
[3:55:41] <%VyperVic> this is terrible
[3:55:42] <%hax_metatron> Oh boy that check might be 100 now
[3:55:45] <Brandon__Brando> @rrratbastard oh ya that fail is bae
[3:55:45] <Detrius25> FeelsBadMan Based On Real Events
[3:55:47] <+JobbedBone> @teefpal oh quit clutching your pearls. You can't be such a waif if you're going to be tackling subject matter like this
[3:55:48] <Brandon__Brando> bad
[3:55:49] <+MrAtheGreat> did you check the bunker door? @PatStaresAt
[3:55:51] <teefpal> Wow, lotta terrible people in the chat tonight
[3:55:52] <Brandon__Brando> BAD
[3:55:55] <+senfood> @PatStaresAt What happened was that a horrible slur was said that would have deeply offended our favorite character. That's all that needs to be said on the matter.
[3:55:59] <teefpal> cope harder jobbed
[3:56:01] <drawerinkshow> Encylocepediad did not have anything on that wall
[3:56:04] <%walternatorz> YOU DANCED WITH THE LOCUSTS
[3:56:06] <aiutare47> @hax_metatron its been 97 for a while
[3:56:10] <DianaTheAscian> @naoi0 did the commander not have a giant face behind him?
[3:56:20] <%AzureGale> LUL
[3:56:23] <%walternatorz> No wonder the locusts are confused
[3:56:26] <naoi0> @DianaTheAscian Oh, sorry, I didn't catch it so I'unno
[3:56:38] <+HonterThompson> @SGrim What it changes is that it's not a real slur and repeating it isn't any worse than "kipt" or any other invented slur for an invented people group in Elysium- are you getting offended on behalf of Kim Kitsuragi, or what?
[3:56:38] <%dankgerald> get bug
[3:56:39] <+Dorf1> isnt 97% the cap? because two ones always fail?
[3:56:42] <DianaTheAscian> k
[3:56:43] <%Make_me_mad> Saying that it's a 'made up slur' or that it's never been used against real people is wildly naïve.
[3:56:43] <+MrAtheGreat> chat about to fight. might need to emote mode for a bit
[3:56:46] <%Jeshk0> time for COMMINISM
[3:56:48] <ingman112> Yep yep

[3:58:27] <xcompleasedad> @JobbedBone Ah. Gotcha
[3:58:30] <%Urgotfantasy> @aiutare47 Pat has been shitting on communists the whole time LUL
[3:58:34] <%dankgerald> read
[3:58:35] <%Blackleafx> You will
[3:58:35] <Gartobo> POLITICS KILLED ME IM A GHOST NOW
[3:58:37] <%Blackleafx> don't worry
[3:58:40] <+HonterThompson> @SGrim I wasn't doing it for the delight of saying it, I just thought Pat would benefit from knowing how nasty-sounding the slur was
[3:58:41] <$bognugget> you will
[3:58:41] <%X2Eliah> Hey Pat are you finishing it today?
[3:58:43] <%hax_metatron> You will
[3:58:43] <drawerinkshow> Wish sleep time counted
[3:58:43] <%NateyBeak> pat you can just re read books over and over to waste time
[3:58:43] <ingman112> Lena might have gone to bed actually?
[3:58:45] <PartyFavors> You've got a ton of books, you'll have time
[3:58:45] <%hax_metatron> Don't worry you will
[3:58:46] <dreamfillah> you prolly will
[3:58:49] <ingman112> Nope jk
[3:58:49] <aiutare47> @Urgotfantasy I hope folks arent taking it too seriously
[3:58:52] <cardamomo88> POLITICS FUCK MY MOM
[3:58:57] <%hax_metatron> This game is nowhere close to being done LUL
[3:58:59] <%Pookiedaexzile> My cousin tried politics once. Fucker died
[3:59:00] <Detrius25> Is there good politic music at least?
[3:59:00] <ingman112> 8 HOUR STREAM OR BUST
[3:59:06] <aiutare47> I doubt it highly, unless youre going very late
[3:59:08] <+MrAtheGreat> maybe read the innocence book if you can't get that thought before the point of no return
[3:59:08] <%Blackleafx> Dw shitting on communist is the sign he's a TRUE communist
[3:59:08] <+JobbedBone> theres a lot left
[3:59:11] <%Blackleafx> :)
[3:59:17] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> you are getting near the end tho
[3:59:19] <%Mendin> Solid 1.5-2 hours minimum
[3:59:19] <+HonterThompson> If I want to say a slur really badly, I'll say a slur I can actually reclaim, like going outside and yelling "f---ot" really loudly
[3:59:28] <+emperri> yikes I really need to unpack who hurt chat. be a decent human being and let that sink in
[3:59:31] <teefpal> It's probably 4-5 hours to end credits
[3:59:34] <+mczarklesby> Yeah, you could maybe do it tonight if you really wanted to power through and skip some side stuff, but wrapping it up Thursday is good as well and not rushed.
[3:59:41] <teefpal> but the climax is very close
[3:59:42] <aiutare47> @HonterThompson Go for it man.
[3:59:45] <oda_flobunaga> Content wise, Pat's at the 50% mark right?
[3:59:53] <+HonterThompson> LieutenantStaresAt is my favorite twitch channel
[3:59:54] <Detrius25> FeelsBadMan P-chat
[3:59:57] <%VyperVic> 3
[3:59:59] <+emperri> @oda_flobunaga he's like 80%
[3:59:59] <%velemi> 1
[4:00:01] <ingman112> Pat you're only a quarter through the game
[4:00:03] <$SGrim> @HonterThompson Interesting take, especially the choice of doing it for his "benefit." I remain disgusted.
[4:00:03] <%X2Eliah> Idk he's more like at the 85% mark
[4:00:05] <%dankgerald> you're close to communism
[4:00:06] <user_naim> Another stream would give time for thoughts as well.
[4:00:07] <%VyperVic> @oda_flobunaga 80
[4:00:15] <oda_flobunaga> @emperri shhhhhhh

[4:00:28] <+TheotherKristian> NEVAH GIV UP!!!
[4:00:34] <+emperri> why would you ask a question and then complain about the answer
[4:00:34] <teefpal> He could beat the game tonight in a few hours if he just skips all the side content
[4:00:36] <oda_flobunaga> actually, its probablly more like 30-45 %
[4:00:44] <Detrius25> TearGlove
[4:00:44] <DianaTheAscian> uh oh
[4:00:45] <Press_X_ToJASON> @oda_flobunaga it's not like half of chat has been spoiling things the entire playthrough

[4:12:39] <teefpal> Do what you want
[4:12:45] <%VyperVic> god, tbh. I can tell you what Klassje says.
[4:12:48] <%ingman112> You only need 20
[4:12:49] <%Mendin> the Klassje content is minor stuff that you can get at the start of a subsequent playthrough if you get the right dialogue checks on firest meet
[4:12:51] <%Monkeyweed21> DECIDE YOU CENTRIST COWARD
[4:12:53] <%Blackleafx> Yes
[4:12:54] <%ingman112> Items only
[4:12:58] <+ReallyBigRocks> Well if you're gonna talk to them then you should read
[4:12:59] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> you can only pay until 21 i think
[4:13:01] <%bevyrage> no just drop back to your shack so kim goes to bed
[4:13:03] <+MrAtheGreat> Save here, send kim, talk to klaasje, then reload and commie
[4:13:05] <%ingman112> Don't sell that
[4:13:05] <+magusdraco> don't sell the spirits
[4:13:07] <+magusdraco> the end
[4:13:08] <%bevyrage> then hit up the whirling through the secret passage?
[4:13:09] <teefpal> Klass isn't that good
[4:13:09] <derap41> keep it
[4:13:10] <%walternatorz> don't you dare
[4:13:10] <heysamuel> do not sell the spirits
[4:13:11] <%illusiveSaint> why not sleep in the village?
[4:13:12] <%Ranryu692> thats four encyclopedia checks
[4:13:12] <+JobbedBone> the filament
[4:13:13] <Lelfro> Kim can leave when you enter shack?
[4:13:14] <AmuserName> Filament?
[4:13:14] <Detrius25> MrDestructoid Chat: Roll for indecision
[4:13:16] <LeotheHuntsman> kim automatically goes to bed after you enter your room, just do when he goes to bed
[4:13:16] <oda_flobunaga> DO NOT SELL THE MEDICAL SPIRIT
[4:13:16] <%Monkeyweed21> the klaasje stuff isnt major
[4:13:17] <candidateplays> Just read the book aNOPEnd
[4:13:17] <+AWKWARDL0SER> Just go inside your free shack and Kim will goodnight
[4:13:22] <%X2Eliah> dont sell soul juice
[4:13:23] <%dankgerald> you already cant pay for your room, shits locked
[4:13:24] <%Blackleafx> Klaasje's not that good
[4:13:24] <%bevyrage> you're also only on day 5
[4:13:29] <%bevyrage> you can do some of it tomorrow
[4:13:32] <%hax_metatron> Yeah Klaasje is an okay miss
[4:13:36] <+JobbedBone> you can sell the USB stick cube
[4:13:37] <%Mendin> Klassje content can be found at the start of a playthrough as well if you do a good skill check
[4:13:38] <%illusiveSaint> it's extra content
[4:13:38] <%hax_metatron> She tells you nothing you already didn't know
[4:13:41] <%VyperVic> I can tell you about Klaasje if you want, no worries
[4:13:42] <%X2Eliah> Klaasje is overrated anyway
[4:13:44] <%ingman112> If I had a thumbs up emoji I'd use it
[4:13:45] <+Mucmaster> If you just go into your shack kim will leave you don't need to pay for a room
[4:13:50] <fedemachado96> read!!!!!

[4:14:03] <%X2Eliah> ITS NOT MAGIC ITS SCIENCE
[4:14:03] <%illusiveSaint> never had the klassje convo i arrested her lol
[4:14:10] <%hax_metatron> Klaasje conversation is basically more self-loathing for Harry, okay to miss.

[4:24:46] <%Grimlockfly> Cheer500 Fuck Bourgeois Physics, all my homies hate Bourgeois Physics!
[4:24:55] <%Mr_Pylon> Oh yeah, light bending net worth guy does exist, BOURGEOUIS PHYSICS IS REAL
[4:24:57] <+emperri> yeah it's worth noting that this is actually plausible in this universe but as real world satire it's spot on
[4:24:58] <Detrius25> TheIlluminati Wait what
[4:25:00] <%dankgerald> we are free from History
[4:25:04] <derap41> Isn't that you pat

[4:25:35] <+justianxix> damn
[4:25:35] <leinadtonu> Does he bark when you say BOURGEOUIS
[4:25:39] <teefpal> Oh boy they're quoting hitler
[4:25:44] <+rrratbastard> the physics of FUCK YEAH COMMUNISM
[4:25:45] <%Pookiedaexzile> the woof Percent eat 70 percent the foods

[4:26:03] <+justianxix> he doubts your belief in the COMMUNE
[4:26:06] <%dankgerald> pat
[4:26:07] <%bevyrage> that's not a quote from hitler, that's a quote from stalin

[4:26:09] <%StevorenoElcamino> The borkgeoisie
[4:26:11] <%Ranryu692> SAVE
[4:26:11] <YumAntimatter> ok but the idea of a government where the buildings literally collapse when people lose faith in it is cool as hell

[4:26:32] <$ItsRatman> Gief mad at theoretical communism architecture
[4:26:34] <+senfood> It's funny how a person has to understand physics super well in order to get it that fucking wrong.
[4:26:36] <DSD24> @jorniev Man Gordon Freeman in "Freeman's Mind" literally said that line for line and its so funny

[4:27:01] <%VyperVic> he'll definitely hit the PONR this stream
[4:27:16] <lowercasejai> i love this song so much
[4:27:27] <+senfood> Imagine if Stalin told the USSR that they could overtake the West using psychic powers.
[4:27:27] <%dankgerald> god i love how to a communist that believes in psychic ability, physics *is* a bourgeois concept
[4:27:46] <+achickenorsomething> well this is awkward

[4:27:58] <Detrius25> CorgiDerp CorgiDerp KomodoHype <3
[4:28:05] <%VyperVic> so do the other ideological vision quests take place in the same room?
[4:28:06] <%GarbageNirvana> I mean that's basically what the SS were resorting to towards the end right? Magical occult bullshit?
[4:28:19] <+senfood> The Men Who Stare At the Means of Production
[4:28:20] <doc_ock_rokc> @senfood He kinda did at one point
[4:28:20] <+JobbedBone> @senfood that applies to all art "you have to know the rules to break them effectively"
[4:28:32] <Detrius25> cvHazmat Politic
[4:28:35] <teefpal> It's all very Posadist
[4:28:38] <%dankgerald> the SS were trying to do magic, psychics are pseduoscience
[4:28:44] <+MrAtheGreat> If something amazing doesn't happen in this stream, def check out the next one. You don't want to miss anything coming up next :D
[4:28:51] <%donbomber777> !uptime
[4:28:51] <@Moobot> @donbomber777 I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 29m.
[4:28:51] <%dankgerald> y'all want some pringles?
[4:29:09] <+senfood> @JobbedBone That's what's so hilarious about it. I'm not laughing just because it's ridiculous. I'm laughing because I'm surprised it didn't actually happen in real life.
[4:29:14] <doc_ock_rokc> @JobbedBone Sadly people don't strudy the classics these days. There is some good lost techniques i impliment into digital art that can really make things pop
[4:29:16] <Detrius25> cvHazmat protect from the magic politic
[4:29:21] <%VyperVic> this game peaks at its end. definitely looking forward to it.
[4:29:26] <+Havictos> I thought the psychic/magic shit was mostly Himmler?
[4:29:34] <+senfood> RELOAD
[4:29:40] <%VyperVic> @havictos yep
[4:29:45] <%dankgerald> nah Hitler was super about it
[4:29:59] <doc_ock_rokc> @Havictos US, USSR and The axis powers were all super into occult shit
[4:30:01] <balthazar758> @havictos yes
[4:30:06] <%sunsetdisc0> psychic communism sounds silly, but when you remember that DE takes place in a world where entropy is a physical and scientifically proven force, the planet isnt round, and dudes can be so rich they bend light around them it's like yeah sure why not
[4:30:08] <teefpal> Himmler was a nerd, he wasn't well-liked
[4:30:40] <+senfood> If there's one thing I learned from Hellboy it's that the WWII occult arms race was heated.
[4:30:49] <%dankgerald> the only good things about fascists are their uniforms, otherwise theyre all nerds
[4:30:54] <%VyperVic> @dankgerald pretty sure he openly disapproved of Himmler's obsession with the occult
[4:30:58] <doc_ock_rokc> Daily reminder that Entropy IS scientifically proven in our reality as well...just not on the actual fabric of reality
[4:31:01] <derap41> @sunsetdisc0 I mean some can be prescribes as unreliable narrators.
[4:31:06] <%X2Eliah> Yeah the thing about DE's world, is that people legitimately use psychic/thought power to cross the Pale
[4:31:07] <%Pookiedaexzile> "Look we are Jedi, but we need like 60 of us all on the beach at once to crush one ship"
[4:31:17] <Chernobylpp> @sunsetdisc0 although the light bending capitalist is only a product of Harry's mind, your point still stands when it comes to the other parts
[4:31:30] <%dankgerald> @vypervic well would you openly *support* occult shit as the leader of a major war machine?
[4:31:34] <Detrius25> SourPls SourPls SourPls
[4:31:36] <%X2Eliah> And the text hints that the isolas - i.e. the matter islands - only exist because of people
[4:31:39] <HeroToxiko> im pretty sure that part was specifically abut how physics works in revachol. the name of the game is hinting at some pretty weird stuff if it's literally Elysium
[4:31:49] <+senfood> @X2Eliah That's a very good point. The supranatural would be more present in the collective consciiousness since it literally exists.
[4:31:58] <HeroToxiko> @dankgerald you mean Christians? LUL
[4:31:58] <teefpal> Remember Dolores Dei wasnt human
[4:32:12] <teefpal> or other religions
[4:32:22] <Chernobylpp> @x2eliah oh shit I'm a infra-materialist now
[4:32:25] <+senfood> Dolores Dei was aggressively human.
[4:32:33] <%dankgerald> @herotoxiko faith is a proven motivator
[4:32:37] <doc_ock_rokc> To be fair to the 40s we were discovering some weird shit we couldn't explain and harnising the invisible fire of the atom
[4:32:38] <%VyperVic> dolores dei terrifies me, almost as much as the pale and the seven sisters
[4:32:44] <+senfood> Dolores Dei was just the Pope of Neoliberalism.
[4:32:47] <+xysizzle> remember dolores dei WAS HUMAN
[4:33:01] <%Pookiedaexzile> @teefpal neither was Jesus
[4:33:02] <+senfood> RELOAD
[4:33:08] <+Havictos> Could the nazi party or any kind of world war have even come about in a world where if you want to invade someone you have to travel through literal non-existence?
[4:33:08] <doc_ock_rokc> Beep boop totally human
[4:33:09] <%sunsetdisc0> fuck her innocence of humanisn dolores dei, all my homies hate her innocence of humanism dolores dei
[4:33:14] <%X2Eliah> Dolores Dei started as human (maybe) and then stopped doing normal human stuff
[4:33:21] <Chernobylpp> Dolores Dei reads almost like a player controlled character in an rpg
[4:33:27] <%X2Eliah> again, (maybe)
[4:33:28] <+xysizzle> dolores dei was basically jesus and it’s horrifying
[4:33:32] <%VyperVic> @senfood truly the gaslight gatekeep girlboss of her age
[4:33:42] <Blank9> mass murderer, fuck dolores dei
[4:33:45] <derap41> This place seems to take place is a 4D Hyperbolic geometry
[4:33:49] <%Kay_Tana> Kay_Tana subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 30 months! Will you play Re:Verse when it goes live?
[4:33:55] <teefpal> Fascism exists in-universe already
[4:33:57] <%dankgerald> She's just Elizabeth Warren
[4:33:59] <%Pookiedaexzile> People can also make up things in a world with legit scifi elements
[4:34:00] <doc_ock_rokc> To be fair DE has a 2mm hole in the world that projects the musical equivalant of zero the world could have anything
[4:34:02] <derap41> Dolores Dei is "history written by the victor"
[4:34:12] <teefpal> It's described as a patchwork of isolas and pale
[4:34:13] <Detrius25> LUL thought Himmler belived in Agartha (hollow earth) theory.
[4:34:18] <teefpal> and as a sphere
[4:34:26] <+Havictos> @X2Eliah Honestly after learning of the Pale all bets are off on what's possible to me honestly
[4:34:31] <derap41> @doc_ock_rokc we have that too its called ANC
[4:34:32] <+senfood> @VyperVic And Harry is the Manipulate, Mansplain, Malewife the Revachol needs. LUL
[4:34:35] <teefpal> Almost like a disco ball...
[4:34:38] <%VyperVic> @doc_ock_rokc we have that too. it's called imagine dragons
[4:34:38] <+xysizzle> doloreis dei is a jesus allegory
[4:34:40] <%sunsetdisc0> @xysizzle not really. her lungs glowed, she forgot to breathe for upwards of 10 minutes sometimes, and her body was unnaturally warm. she never really did any miracles aside from advising a queen to send out a bunch of ships to try and find other isolas
[4:34:43] <%dankgerald> I believe in Egg Theory. there is a bahamut in the earths core.
[4:34:46] <+emperri> innocences are like, newtypes?
[4:34:46] <+JobbedBone> can you imagine what jesus could accomplish if the world had the internet, believed him, and gave him anything he wanted?
[4:34:50] <%X2Eliah> yeah. The Pale makes a lot of weird things possible
[4:34:52] <balthazar758> @Detrius25 he was a nutcase and a notorious yesman.
[4:35:05] <+JobbedBone> Thats what innosences
[4:35:07] <+JobbedBone> are
[4:35:12] <%Pookiedaexzile> I got footage of Jesus's 4th water walk
[4:35:42] <%sunsetdisc0> jesus on tiktok multiplying pizza for everyone
[4:35:45] <Chernobylpp> The only ideology that works in DE is that of hardcore. I mean, music and people literally keep the pale at bay...
[4:35:48] <%Pookiedaexzile> It was in Dallas in 1992,  before he got famous
[4:35:48] <+senfood> Ok but can we all agree that birds aren't real?
[4:35:52] <Detrius25> @balthazar758 Sounds right. Think towards the end everyone gave up though.
[4:35:52] <%Monkeyweed21> I got an NFT of Jesus dabbing
[4:35:53] <%dankgerald> did Pat ever have that conversation with Kim about gun control?
[4:35:57] <%VyperVic> aye, comrades. bash the fash

[4:36:02] <+emperri> birds are very important

[4:36:10] <%VyperVic> @dankgerald yes
[4:36:16] <Detrius25> FeelsAmazingMan 4th jesus water walk
[4:36:16] <teefpal> Its spoilers but there are people who know about the swallow
[4:36:18] <+senfood> Birds are very important and also not real/
[4:36:18] <%ingman112> Pain Threshold might be good
[4:36:21] <balthazar758> @Detrius25 yeah, he betrayed hitler in the end. the nazis were all cowards
[4:36:23] <doc_ock_rokc> @VyperVic Nice but they are the musisian's equivalant of zerozeroes
[4:36:23] <%X2Eliah> hand/eye?
[4:36:27] <%X2Eliah> Hand eye might be good
[4:36:30] <oda_flobunaga> UwU
[4:36:33] <%jorniev> PAIN
[4:36:34] <Sigma_190_Beta> I like Calc and Hand Eye those are my two favorites.
[4:36:35] <%ingman112> Should be fine for handeye

[4:36:44] <+tigerfang86> shoot hard
[4:36:44] <+Havictos> @JobbedBone I feel like she seriously knew some secret shit about reality. All the lore about her talks like she had a plan with what she was doing.
[4:36:44] <%Broand> Pain threshold or hand eye
[4:36:45] <derap41> Half Light?
[4:36:46] <Ids560> sure
[4:36:46] <%X2Eliah> I'd say yes
[4:36:47] <%bevyrage> save a point, but 6 is good for hand/eye
[4:36:47] <Chernobylpp> sure
[4:36:47] <%Mendin> Yes
[4:36:48] <fedemachado96> 5 is ok

[4:37:07] <+Havictos> @PatStaresAt It would come in handy all I'm saying

[4:44:57] <%velemi> I can't believe failing this check turned into something honestly good
[4:44:57] <Tisaric> It's so fucking good
[4:44:58] <heysamuel> that was a really good failed check imo
[4:44:59] <xcompleasedad> The game is literally talking you out of your misogyny
[4:45:00] <Detrius25> Joker Moment
[4:45:05] <+tigerfang86> the meme kinda just turns into a good look at harry
[4:45:09] <%nomos42> it's almost like socialism is feminism and anti-racist!
[4:45:09] <+tigerfang86> it's really fuckin good
[4:45:10] <+emperri> yes
[4:45:16] <%ingman112> Exactly
[4:45:16] <Tisaric> Oh 100%
[4:45:19] <cardamomo88> yes
[4:45:20] <iosephe> Yup
[4:45:20] <doc_ock_rokc> Yeah

[4:45:21] <%X2Eliah> yep
[4:45:21] <%velemi> pretty much!
[4:45:21] <%kyh9> yes

[4:45:24] <$hattrick61> that is correct
[4:45:24] <%jorniev> oh wow
[4:45:24] <+magusdraco> yup
[4:45:24] <+senfood> I love how the fauilures are their own interesting conversation lines, except insanely fucked up.
[4:45:24] <Ids560> fascism one is this too
[4:45:25] <balthazar758> makes you think
[4:45:26] <HeroToxiko> Almost like that was the point nod nod
[4:45:26] <%walternatorz> He needs to start a revolution.
[4:45:26] <moonmeh> im actually really happy with this outcome honestly
[4:45:28] <YumAntimatter> i love this game!
[4:45:28] <%GarbageNirvana> He's rationalizing the FUCK out of it
[4:45:28] <teefpal> yea
[4:45:28] <Blank9> it's the MAN
[4:45:28] <RedPlasticCup> yes, absolutely
[4:45:28] <Sol_Install> I really like that
[4:45:29] <%cobalt_phoenix_> YEA
[4:45:29] <oda_flobunaga> that's a BINGO
[4:45:31] <moonmeh> this is super cool
[4:45:31] <+emperri> harry doesn't like the ex-something
[4:45:32] <+tigerfang86> he just wants out
[4:45:32] <doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt And thats what happens all the time in the realworld
[4:45:32] <Dr_Mooose> I mean
[4:45:33] <%X2Eliah> Getting to this point is a really good thing for harry
[4:45:33] <+mczarklesby> Oh yeah, more coping mechanisms. And these guys for all their outlandishness really ARE sympathetic in their own way.
[4:45:33] <$SGrim> PROFOUND
[4:45:34] <%Jeshk0> big yup
[4:45:34] <fabo_joyful> YEP
[4:45:34] <T_Sasquatch> Its almost like ..... Maybe
[4:45:35] <akitanito> everyone's telling him it's not his fault
[4:45:37] <Blank9> it's everything but me
[4:45:38] <teefpal> Its my favorite part of the game
[4:45:39] <$ItsRatman> Oh man could you imagine if Harry canonically went fascist?
[4:45:40] <Tisaric> That's like the entire game basically, it's fucking AMAZING
[4:45:41] <+tigerfang86> he really wants out but he can't cause that's life
[4:45:41] <%Piemono> Harry is prime Redpill material
[4:45:43] <Detrius25> Yep
[4:45:45] <SolSwagGuy56> BibleThump
[4:45:47] <moonmeh> its so RAW
[4:45:49] <%Jeshk0> it is hardcore depressing
[4:45:50] <HeroToxiko> can't be a depressed divorce if you're "the last true communist"
[4:45:51] <+xysizzle> its all about that. that’s why this game is beautiful
[4:45:51] <%thomassolorio> how sad
[4:45:52] <+Astrobstrd> Oh fuck yeah absolutely
[4:45:52] <%illusiveSaint> some people choose religion, others philosophy or theory
[4:45:53] <PepperJam_Art> It's exactly because of that that you NEED to talk about his ideology on the payphone
[4:45:55] <%kyh9> I tell people this whenever they talk about how ideologies are depicted in this game: everything, EVERY THING is through the filter of Harry's depression and break up
[4:45:56] <+Sgtnicholasangle> Its incredibly real
[4:45:57] <doc_ock_rokc> EVERYTHING In harry's life is about that moment
[4:45:57] <%hax_metatron> YOURE NOT EVEN AT THE SADDEST PARTS YET
[4:45:57] <moonmeh> liek you can feel it
[4:45:59] <+emperri> oh boy pat is gonna love the bed
[4:46:01] <+Winnower> You can only play the saddest song ever written once, y'know
[4:46:01] <derap41> Only the effect of it
[4:46:02] <%sunsetdisc0> i think its more hes trying to find an ideology thatll make it make sense and help him process it
[4:46:02] <Lelfro> it's not conscious sorrow
[4:46:03] <Dio_TR> :)
[4:46:04] <%Mr_Pylon> All you see is the intense aftereffects of all that longing
[4:46:04] <%Ranryu692> you only get glimpses
[4:46:05] <oda_flobunaga> ... ..... ..... .. .  . . . . ........
[4:46:05] <+mczarklesby> He's just hunted by it.
[4:46:06] <+senfood> Harry's sorrow is always just past the event horizon but you feel it intensely.
[4:46:07] <%thomassolorio> its called denial
[4:46:08] <doc_ock_rokc> EVERYTHING YOU ARE DOING is a coping mechanism
[4:46:08] <Astrophizz> has Pat had the phone call yet?
[4:46:09] <AmuserName> it's so good
[4:46:09] <thebalticguy1> very real
[4:46:09] <%bevyrage> just wait until you see the dream with the chick. it's a good one - electrochemistry
[4:46:10] <%jorniev> SO SAD
[4:46:11] <Ids560> there is a reason for this
[4:46:11] <Dio_TR> Yep never
[4:46:13] <Dr_Mooose> it was the past
[4:46:13] <%Pookiedaexzile> HE's like a Walking Crater
[4:46:15] <+Sgtnicholasangle> Thats because thats how we treat our own wounds
[4:46:15] <%cobalt_phoenix_> :)
[4:46:16] <@PlagueOfGripes> well, you do eventually relive it sort of
[4:46:17] <televisedrevolting> He simply is. Perhaps it's a default state of being.
[4:46:17] <+JobbedBone> a lot of people have a sudden break and then get into politics in middle age, its strange
[4:46:19] <+FanServ> you never feel the love, just its absence
[4:46:22] <%ingman112> @bevyrage Careful
[4:46:22] <+meattube1> I think thats called good writing?

[4:46:46] <%Pookiedaexzile> Plague wit the spoils
[4:46:48] <teefpal> A lot of them have it building up inside, middle age is when a lot of people have a crisis
[4:46:58] <teefpal> that crisis can be political
[4:46:59] <%hax_metatron> I love how at the end of this quest, these book club nerd communists are ... good people. You know, kids, into books. With decent thoughts.

[4:58:29] <%Broand> Ah yes, the Nad Fad

[4:58:33] <+GuilKato> @PatStaresAt are you getting fake balls installed in Zangief
[4:58:35] <%Monkeyweed21> If you put them in a pickle jar Paige will eat them
[4:58:36] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @PatStaresAt Put them on Buscemi's forehead.
[4:58:37] <$lumporr> pickled nuts
[4:58:41] <%illusiveSaint> trendsetter gimmick
[4:58:41] <%ingman112> Can you imagine the audacity of someone not only chopping off your balls but preserving them and waving them around in front of you?
[4:58:42] <%Broken_Sonex> Now that's just legit fucked up and cruel
[4:58:43] <%LordAngry> Paige might forget they were not pickles you can't risk it
[4:58:44] <dd44dostivei> give it a little get smoked cap
[4:58:45] <librettodude> You would get sacked so hard
[4:58:50] <BlueSpartan119> are dog balls TOS safe tho?
[4:58:51] <%CatastropheCorvid> COWARD
[4:58:51] <Sol_Install> my god
[4:58:52] <%Garthunox> Bad idea pat, paige drinks pickle juice

[4:58:59] <LordOfThePoultry> LUL
[4:58:59] <MaraSmug> LUL
[4:59:00] <%Mendin> on his harness
[4:59:01] <Krisaeron> PAT - HOW ABOUT DISCO DOG BALLS
[4:59:02] <doc_ock_rokc> So we'd have Skelmo, Steve Bushimo, Elmo, zangeif and Zanballs?
[4:59:02] <+magusdraco> oh god that would be horrifying
[4:59:03] <calaska140> SCREW THIS IM READING THE GULAG ARCHIPELAGO
[4:59:03] <derap41> Yea
[4:59:03] <candidateplays> Truck Nuts, but for Dogs
[4:59:04] <+AudacityESQ> Fine, get real balls.
[4:59:04] <Sol_Install> This went off the rails so fast

[4:59:11] <%cobalt_phoenix_> wait are fake nuts a thing now?
[4:59:12] <+senfood> Paige would get halfway through and then realize it.
[4:59:15] <%Pookiedaexzile> Zangiefs Balls in a Jar are like The Money in the Bank Briefcase
[4:59:17] <Parapattern> Paige might think it's soup
[4:59:22] <spooksy> oh my god shut up
[4:59:22] <%TaifuDragon> Putting fake balls in your dog is basically admitting that dog balls are a necessary aesthetic feature of your dog
[4:59:24] <%ingman112> THEY'RE ALL IN ON IT
[4:59:26] <cardamomo88> LIES THEY CALM DOWN A LOT
[4:59:26] <%ingman112> IT'S A RACKET
[4:59:28] <%TaifuDragon> I find that suspect
[4:59:36] <+Astrobstrd> Dogs are calmer after neutering in like 99% of cases
[4:59:37] <%NateyBeak> please save elmo from humps
[4:59:37] <+AudacityESQ> They’re pretty aggressive when you do it, though.
[4:59:39] <HeroToxiko> there's a week or so when they lose their shit but they chill out afterward
[4:59:40] <+Mucmaster> I mean I'd get mad if some doctor chopped off my balls
[4:59:41] <$hattrick61> I know if my balls got choppad id be pretty upset
[4:59:41] <%Maids4lyfe> they get more calm with out their balls
[4:59:42] <akitanito> replace balls with bells
[4:59:43] <%walternatorz> whatever prompt is going off like crazy
[4:59:46] <%X2Eliah> Honestly what you do with chopped dog balls is you hang them under your pickup truck
[4:59:49] <BeezusHrist> Dogs are less aggressive @PatStaresAt . whoever said that is a fucking moron
[4:59:54] <Stevie0g> That guy is a dog ball insurrectionist
[4:59:55] <terramagus> I mean yeah of course th ey're aggressive immediately afterwards.
[4:59:56] <$lumporr> :(
[4:59:57] <Lelfro> Do you really think people who chop dog's balls have pets?
[5:00:01] <%walternatorz> ruhroh
[5:00:03] <%Mr_Pylon> wrong trap
[5:00:03] <Gartobo> replace it with a squeaky toy
[5:00:12] <%Niodi_7_4> removing the balls decreases the rage meter
[5:00:12] <%TaifuDragon> You mean VETS?
[5:00:14] <SirCacaPee> LETSGO
[5:00:16] <+MrAtheGreat> Gotta feel bad for the little guys
[5:00:23] <NeutrinoInteraction> I mean they're locusts, it's not like they have things like "feelings" or "awareness beyond basic programming"
[5:00:24] <%TaifuDragon> Yes I assume vets probably have pets if they waned to become a vet
[5:00:27] <doc_ock_rokc> @Lelfro Yes
[5:00:30] <BeezusHrist> @PatStaresAt And the balls aren't actually "chopped off"; they remove the testes
[5:00:30] <%ingman112> Ooh you know what, you can talk to Lilienne after Kim leaves
[5:00:32] <%illusiveSaint> I've seen there's a fad of owners praising their dogs balls
[5:00:33] <$lumporr> @Niodi_7_4 turns it into the impotent rage meter
[5:00:36] <akitanito> did you replace the locusts yet?
[5:00:36] <%Maids4lyfe> most veterinarians have pets
[5:00:36] <+AudacityESQ> Every dog I’ve ever met says they got pretty aggressive when someone tried to do it
[5:00:37] <+mczarklesby> You wanna get really crazy and hit that mural in the dead of night?
[5:00:38] <+MrAtheGreat> There’s no need
[5:00:39] <+magusdraco> Kim: oh god dammit Harry
[5:00:44] <+MrAtheGreat> Nothing changes
[5:00:45] <bakkatohri> If you think about it, animals are a lot like humans in regard to the fact that they all have their own personality traits. Some of them even have baby-eating traits.
[5:00:46] <%justacrow84> justacrow84 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 33 months!
[5:00:47] <%walternatorz> Kim is going to be so pissed when you brought him all the way out here to check phasmid traps.
[5:00:50] <%X2Eliah> @NeutrinoInteraction Yeah it's a real weird thing, are they just automata or is there something

[5:04:00] <%Fenrisulfr_V> Wait, Pat shaved? Did he remove the Expression as well?
[5:04:02] <%Broken_Sonex> I'm glad Pat is saying fuck it to this one.
[5:04:03] <%AzureGale> It's the Paige call?
[5:04:07] <Sol_Install> we can help with a vote yea
[5:04:08] <$lumporr> lilienne is so nice
[5:04:13] <%X2Eliah> Expression is still on
[5:04:15] <+JobbedBone> SourPls
[5:04:16] <NeutrinoInteraction> Yeah you've earned a savescum or two
[5:04:25] <$lumporr> this game has a lot of heartwarming moments
[5:04:29] <%VyperVic> we're dealing with shaved expression harry, the most cursed harry
[5:04:41] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @X2Eliah That's good. Henry with no Expression or facial hair is tragic.
[5:04:43] <Krisaeron> no kidding
[5:04:45] <cardamomo88> well i go to bed nigth
[5:04:47] <%AzureGale> Savescums are like Lays potato chips - you can't have just one
[5:05:03] <Detrius25> FeelsBadMan not the call
[5:05:05] <%X2Eliah> Oh that phone call is legit
[5:05:09] <%Fenrisulfr_V> Henry lol. I meant Harry
[5:05:14] <%X2Eliah> if it was a marketer, it would be done now
[5:05:16] <DSD24> Shaved with No Expression is the saddest
[5:05:23] <$lumporr> @X2Eliah BUT IT'S THE TRUTH
[5:05:34] <+JobbedBone> I think no expression keep beard suits where harry needs to be in his life most. He can't keep kidding himself like that
[5:05:38] <DSD24> At least with the expression he still looks sort of happy I guess?
[5:05:40] <%VyperVic> @dsd24 that's the best one
[5:05:41] <%Fenrisulfr_V> Saved+No Expression is what my 2n playthrough has. Very sad.
[5:05:44] <%sunsetdisc0> @X2Eliah idk dude between the two i feel like the facial hair is the more important one
[5:05:46] <%X2Eliah> Guillaume Le Million
[5:06:03] <%X2Eliah> Yeah personally I think shaving is a big mistake
[5:06:15] <%X2Eliah> did it in my 1st run and NEVER AGAIN
[5:06:17] <%Fenrisulfr_V> I'm really excited for my 3rd playthrough with Fascism and Apocalypse Cop.
[5:06:22] <%VyperVic> @x2eliah kim agrees
[5:06:44] <+JobbedBone> beard is realistic. He has to work with where hes at in his life

[5:24:37] <+icekept> its better with him
[5:24:41] <teefpal> Time for bed
[5:24:47] <+Havictos> You need Kim's combined power
[5:24:47] <derap41> Time to read Fantasy Fiction
[5:24:51] <+emperri> read books in the stopped time
[5:24:54] <%Urgotfantasy> Comfi
[5:24:54] <xcompleasedad> Read a book?
[5:24:55] <user_naim> Time for sleep
[5:24:57] <%Blackleafx> but what about book
[5:24:58] <SomeAsianDood> wait chat. Can someone whisper me what red check the sword is good for?
[5:24:59] <xcompleasedad> YES
[5:24:59] <NeroInfinite> "Look Kim I got AKNOFE!"
[5:25:02] <%ingman112> Yes
[5:25:02] <akitanito> you can
[5:25:03] <%bassoontyphoon> goodnight!
[5:25:03] <%Blackleafx> Yes
[5:25:04] <%ingman112> That would be the time
[5:25:05] <+magusdraco> time for bed, you'll finish the game in one to two more streams
[5:25:06] <Krisaeron> YES
[5:25:09] <%ingman112> Time doesn't move forward
[5:25:11] <$lumporr> because this time doesn't matter
[5:25:11] <akitanito> because you don't pass time
[5:25:11] <SomeAsianDood> I've beaten the game so I won't be spoiled
[5:25:12] <CrabStealer> Yeah
[5:25:12] <+JobbedBone> its free time
[5:25:13] <%Blackleafx> In the stopped time
[5:25:14] <+Mucmaster> Read books in the stopped time
[5:25:14] <Krisaeron> STOPPED TIME
[5:25:15] <derap41> Cause it doesn't take time now
[5:25:16] <+Breaknoon> ZA WARUDO
[5:25:16] <%ingman112> If you want them to move time, then save them
[5:25:19] <+emperri> sure
[5:25:23] <xcompleasedad> No, no, he's right.
[5:25:24] <%Sveargieth> You can read them again
[5:25:27] <%gelatinous_cube> you can reread case files to pass time
[5:25:28] <%ingman112> Depends on what you want to do with em
[5:25:28] <%Blackleafx> @PatStaresAt you can use the bench to automatically move time
[5:25:29] <Chernobylpp> save the books
[5:25:30] <xcompleasedad> Save the books to move time
[5:25:31] <+JobbedBone> you can reread one of them
[5:25:32] <AlmondRoll> books will always move time, even if you've read them already
[5:25:32] <%thomassolorio> you can re read them
[5:25:36] <Dio_TR> Good for you @someasiandood here have a clap
[5:25:43] <%ingman112> @Blackleafx But only without Kim I believe
[5:25:51] <+magusdraco> you can reread books to move time later.
[5:25:51] <%X2Eliah> yeah
[5:25:55] <oda_flobunaga> most of the things you have can only be progressed after the point of no return
[5:25:57] <%X2Eliah> notmuch left
[5:25:58] <+magusdraco> you read books now if you want to have the content without pushing forwards the day
[5:25:59] <%bassoontyphoon> Probably one or tow more streams
[5:26:00] <%X2Eliah> 1 session
[5:26:01] <SomeAsianDood> @Dio_TR oh no I'm just wondering what the sword does. I legit haven't found out
[5:26:02] <%ingman112> Cool cool
[5:26:06] <%VyperVic> big sea, plaisance, and neha are the only ones available right now
[5:26:09] <CrabStealer> Honestly you're pretty close to the end
[5:26:09] <%hax_metatron> Yeah you're at the doorstep of the ending, but even that takes a while LUL
[5:26:10] <%thomassolorio> go see klasja first
[5:26:12] <SomeAsianDood> hoping someone whispers me
[5:26:14] <+emperri> "give plaisance a mental out of being shitty to her daughter"
[5:26:19] <%Blackleafx> Ah thats a fair take
[5:26:19] <derap41> The Sword does what it says it does
[5:26:22] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> you are basically one day away from beating the game
[5:26:28] <%Mendin> From here, probably 2 hours of gameplay
[5:26:28] <Press_X_ToJASON> @magusdraco books only move time forward when you read new options as far as i know
[5:26:33] <oda_flobunaga> @SomeAsianDood it does absolutely nothing but look cool
[5:26:47] <fedemachado96> i recomend doing everything else you want to do before doing the feld building
[5:26:47] <+eanscrale> damn I wish I could doze off like that
[5:26:50] <+JobbedBone> @Press_X_ToJASON can't you reused the hangover cure thing
[5:26:51] <%ingman112> I could see this taking two sessions at most, or one long one
[5:26:55] <UnfilteredComic> @dio@Dio_TR helps you attack a certain thing later

[5:30:11] <%Mendin> Pat: There's a point of no return but the game will TELL you when you get to it, so you can explore a little bit
[5:30:12] <Dio_TR> Yeyeyeyeyeye
[5:30:15] <%Blackleafx> I don't think there's anything left beside the trap that you can actually do
[5:30:17] <+mczarklesby> TBH, kinda want you to just go for it.
[5:30:23] <%Blackleafx> OH, and talking to those people
[5:30:29] <+JobbedBone> @athuramn if it were, this would subsume the rest of my life LUL

[5:33:09] <moonmeh> 2 is a cool answer
[5:33:09] <heartlesshealer> LUL
[5:33:10] <%SilvaChariot0133> "Run awaaaaaaaay!"
[5:33:12] <derap41> Paganism is the answer
[5:33:15] <Sigma_190_Beta> Do 2 is correct though.
[5:33:18] <%ingman112> 2 is the half full answer, 1 is half empty
[5:33:19] <%bassoontyphoon> 2 is accurate oddly eneough
[5:33:24] <%Maids4lyfe> 2 is the feel good answer
[5:33:25] <+MrAtheGreat> I told her to leave LUL
[5:33:41] <%Jeshk0> worship the void
[5:33:42] <Queqs_> HOPE CATCHERS LUL
[5:33:42] <+senfood> I would have told her to leave.
[5:33:43] <%Mendin> Oh good, Annette is back in school
[5:33:45] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> she got to school like a day ago
[5:33:49] <+MrAtheGreat> And pat just murdered Annette. Damn that's cold

[5:34:15] <%Mendin> The dance club will probably hold off the hole for awhile
[5:34:21] <derap41> @DianaTheAscian Entropy man
[5:34:27] <doc_ock_rokc> OH BTW pat did you ever see the pictures of you and paige as DE portraits?
[5:34:33] <xcompleasedad> @DianaTheAscian The Pale is literally anti-THOUGHT.
[5:34:47] <%Mr_Pylon> the church dance with the sword probably looks wild
[5:34:48] <heartlesshealer> DE portraits?
[5:34:50] <+emperri> @xcompleasedad that is exactly incorrect
[5:34:52] <+senfood> @user_naim It's like a dreamcatcher except in Bleach.
[5:34:54] <xcompleasedad> @DianaTheAscian People's brains stop working when in it.
[5:34:59] <%ingman112> Wasteland takes forever
[5:35:08] <%ingman112> So actually I guess reading would help with that
[5:35:12] <derap41> Wasteland must be earned
[5:35:14] <DianaTheAscian> hm
[5:35:20] <user_naim> @senfood alright, sure

[5:41:41] <nevan_44> D:

[5:43:05] <balthazar758> psaGiefrail psaGiefrail psaGiefrail
[5:43:35] <%SilvaChariot0133> maybe
[5:43:38] <+Rofiarf> don't exist anymore
[5:43:39] <LeotheHuntsman> maybe
[5:43:39] <teefpal> Yes
[5:43:39] <+MrAtheGreat> Yes
[5:43:40] <%ingman112> That's a reasonable assumption
[5:43:40] <+Bouerd> Maybe
[5:43:41] <+tigerfang86> oof
[5:43:41] <$Futurecity10> Yes
[5:43:42] <vilecrois> Possibly
[5:43:42] <derap41> maybe
[5:43:43] <+tigerfang86> maybe
[5:43:43] <+magusdraco> could be
[5:43:43] <Parapattern> I think so
[5:43:44] <penitentpendant> Pretty much
[5:43:44] <%athuramn> potentially
[5:43:44] <CrabStealer> Yeah probably
[5:43:45] <heysamuel> that's the theory yeah
[5:43:46] <%X2Eliah> Yeah
[5:43:46] <%SilvaChariot0133> psaBig maybe
[5:43:46] <+Havictos> only the devs know
[5:43:46] <%sunsetdisc0> it's possible
[5:43:47] <LordOfThePoultry> probably
[5:43:48] <%VyperVic> maybe? the pale is expanding
[5:43:48] <%bassoontyphoon> Yup
[5:43:48] <%bevyrage> yes. what's living dies and lives again
[5:43:48] <PartyFavors> It's very possible
[5:43:49] <+mczarklesby> I don't think we know. Maybe?
[5:43:49] <faegbeard> DETH PogChamp
[5:43:50] <%Pookiedaexzile> I think Planet go boom
[5:43:50] <digaogrunge> maybe
[5:43:51] <%Ranryu692> That's how I interpreted it
[5:43:51] <Ids560> it is unclear
[5:43:52] <+Mucmaster> That's whats implied
[5:43:53] <+GuilKato> get a particle accelerator and fire it into the 2mm hole - for science!
[5:43:54] <%X2Eliah> Pale is encroaching all the time
[5:43:54] <+physicslawyer> Probably!
[5:43:54] <candidateplays> That would be the implication yes
[5:43:55] <%Maids4lyfe> maybe
[5:43:56] <%sunsetdisc0> i believe thats the implication
[5:43:57] <heartlesshealer> Pale is just "new world now"
[5:43:57] <Chernobylpp> probably
[5:43:58] <%Maids4lyfe> no one knows
[5:43:59] <%Mendin> Pale -is- expanding and is in weird coronal arcs above the world
[5:44:00] <+emperri> according to whats her name, insulinde materialized out of nothing within the pale
[5:44:01] <$ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Maybe, but that also probably happened before written human history
[5:44:02] <fatalDestiny> Yeah basically, Revachol was found through the inverse process, it used to be pale, but became something.
[5:44:02] <HyperionXV> From life, death. From death, life.
[5:44:03] <+icekept> read the new thought
[5:44:03] <$RealThiele> the PALE came around and settled in
[5:44:04] <+MrAtheGreat> I t's hard to say because it gets erased, maybe even past and all
[5:44:05] <%Grimlockfly> Yup
[5:44:05] <%bevyrage> the game has a running theme of cycles remember
[5:44:05] <fabo_joyful> you'll find out
[5:44:05] <vilecrois> Remember Golden Sun's plot? :)
[5:44:07] <$Futurecity10> @PatStaresAt Remember your talk with joyce, Revochal was willed into existence by pale travelers 400-600 years ago
[5:44:10] <RedPlasticCup> after pale, the world. after the world, the pale again.
[5:44:12] <+tigerfang86> GUN
[5:44:14] <+MrAtheGreat> and your sword!
[5:44:15] <televisedrevolting> Gun and Sword
[5:44:15] <%Broken_Sonex> It's unclear, and i hate that it's unclear.
[5:44:16] <Sigma_190_Beta> Sword as well!
[5:44:17] <ZComiX> first there was nothing then everything came from the pale.
[5:44:18] <candidateplays> There's a rhetoric check earlier that talks about the "Perikarnassian Super-Isola"
[5:44:20] <%GarbageNirvana> Are we in the First
[5:44:21] <+emperri> after the world pale, after the pale the new world etc
[5:44:23] <%GarbageNirvana> Is this Shadowbringers again
[5:44:24] <%The_Gaming_Karp> Deus Ex pistol equip sound
[5:44:25] <%Monkeyweed21> yea and its also possible that everywhere that currently exists was once part of the Pale
[5:44:28] <%Pookiedaexzile> JACKPOT
[5:44:29] <%SilvaChariot0133> veiShrug
[5:44:32] <televisedrevolting> Found
[5:44:32] <%ingman112> What do you mean?
[5:44:32] <ZComiX> now everything is slowly returning to the pale
[5:44:32] <heartlesshealer> sword and light
[5:44:32] <LeotheHuntsman> yes
[5:44:34] <heysamuel> it was found
[5:44:35] <xcompleasedad> Found
[5:44:35] <doc_ock_rokc> MAYBE
[5:44:36] <%Jeshk0> uhhhh when did pat get a sword??
[5:44:36] <derap41> It was discovered
[5:44:37] <%velemi> BOTH?
[5:44:37] <%X2Eliah> WILLED INTO EXISTENCE
[5:44:37] <+Bouerd> Settlers built it
[5:44:38] <Dr_Mooose> yes
[5:44:39] <teefpal> dont know
[5:44:40] <+icekept> read the thought
[5:44:40] <NeutrinoInteraction> It seems like it was just found
[5:44:40] <+Mucmaster> Whoes to say
[5:44:41] <%bassoontyphoon> Think of a globe thats rotating, with various areas becoming pale as it goes around. Now picture a disco ball.
[5:44:42] <Yakobro> yes
[5:44:42] <$RealThiele> communist fantasy island
[5:44:43] <%athuramn> They're civilizations created and fallen through time. the cycle that Harry's world is in is one where it's disassembling
[5:44:44] <Parapattern> Yes, that's true
[5:44:45] <+MrAtheGreat> You do get an answer to that but I cna't rememebr where
[5:44:45] <xcompleasedad> It was DEFINITELY found
[5:44:46] <oda_flobunaga> Who TF knows
[5:44:49] <+emperri> @patstaresat after the world pale, after the pale the new world. insulinde is implied to have not existed until observed
[5:44:50] <%VyperVic> it was settled in a deserted land
[5:44:50] <heartlesshealer> read your new thought
[5:44:50] <derap41> that's the question
[5:44:50] <HeroToxiko> yes
[5:44:51] <%ingman112> Honestly that could be either
[5:44:51] <PartyFavors> did Dolores Dei *create* Revachol?
[5:44:55] <+Rofiarf> ask the devs i guess :|
[5:44:56] <fabo_joyful> Plasm pat
[5:44:57] <+MrAtheGreat> Maybe in the innocene book
[5:44:57] <aiutare47> It’s kinda vague
[5:45:00] <DianaTheAscian> Gun
[5:45:02] <+RoByte2> After the world, the pale; after the pale -- the world again
[5:45:03] <%X2Eliah> Could be either
[5:45:04] <%sunsetdisc0> @Jeshk0 from his date with lillienne
[5:45:04] <teefpal> @bassoontyphoon Perfect description
[5:45:06] <Chernobylpp> who knows
[5:45:06] <$ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> I don't know if you remember, but the hole in reality is what happens after the pale is done
[5:45:06] <Gawayne2> Pat, are you saying they used Plasm to make Revachol?
[5:45:07] <%ingman112> It might have been plasm. Or it might have been a massive coincidence
[5:45:09] <%Maids4lyfe> Revachol had no native population to genocide like the other isolas @PatStaresAt so that has to mean something
[5:45:13] <%ingman112> Turned out great for Dolores Dei, either way
[5:45:14] <+eanscrale> The Commune that works is the dream of communism.
[5:45:15] <%X2Eliah> All the text supports both options
[5:45:16] <heartlesshealer> You don't have to put it on, please look at the new thought's image
[5:45:19] <heysamuel> this is why i want the lead writer's book to get translated. can't wait for more story of this world
[5:45:20] <Blank9> communist wizards, or maybe the plasm of CAPITAL
[5:45:21] <%Ranryu692> Revachol was built by humans on Insulinde, which might or might not have existed before
[5:45:23] <%ingman112> NOT WORTH IT
[5:45:24] <%VyperVic> what if the pale is our reality
[5:45:24] <librettodude> Is Pale just a fully realized Fog of War? A rarified past-information map?
[5:45:26] <$Futurecity10> Yes, remember, you can condense the pale
[5:45:26] <%Pookiedaexzile> So you're saying they were so borked up on Land horny they made the pale into land?
[5:45:26] <+tigerfang86> EVERY RED CHECK?
[5:45:28] <xcompleasedad> It's not that good, either
[5:45:30] <+MrAtheGreat> also I really like how you can see Harry's spine in the thught menu
[5:45:31] <+Mucmaster> All red checks fail!
[5:45:37] <heartlesshealer> EVERY
[5:45:38] <xcompleasedad> BOOKS
[5:45:38] <+magusdraco> every red check fails for the next 4 hours
[5:45:40] <+magusdraco> it's rough
[5:45:41] <candidateplays> One of the worse thoughts in the game
[5:45:43] <%Monkeyweed21> do you?
[5:45:44] <%VyperVic> the effect is hilarious
[5:45:47] <teefpal> Reading time
[5:45:48] <doc_ock_rokc> What if the pale was all the places the game devs had to give up and couldn't fill in
[5:45:49] <%AzureGale> "all red checks fail" BIG OOF
[5:45:49] <+MrAtheGreat> Yeah that one is useless
[5:45:50] <%Maids4lyfe> @librettodude yes that's a good way to think of it
[5:45:55] <%athuramn> that's why the guy who killed Dolores said something to the effect of "we weren't supposed to find it like this "
[5:45:59] <%ingman112> Armor

[5:51:45] <@PlagueOfGripes> a zweihander is just a two handed sword

[5:51:53] <balthazar758> metal music plays in the background the whole time
[5:52:02] <PulverKong> was a proto-Romantic movement in German literature and music that occurred between the late 1760s and early 1780s. Within the movement, individual subjectivity and, in particular, extremes of emotion were given free expression in reaction to the perceived constraints of rationalism imposed by the Enlightenment and associated aesthetic movements.

[6:00:21] <%superc37> this is why i watch the vods
[6:00:26] <%ingman112> @MrAtheGreat I don't think any thoughts told him to go back to the window though. He already passed both white checks there and showed it the figurine
[6:00:27] <$hattrick61> Man that dog is just full of pee
[6:00:27] <derap41> I wanted to know If Hjelmdall defeated the enemies
[6:00:32] <%VyperVic> if you're reading this, subscribe to GigaBoots
[6:00:35] <+Havictos> apparently racists love this book series in universe
[6:00:36] <DianaTheAscian> I never noticed the realistic Pat behind the cartoon one
[6:00:43] <heartlesshealer> just pretty colonialist/racist. 80's fantasy novel shit
[6:00:59] <%VyperVic> @havictos lorry driver loves the series
[6:01:05] <heartlesshealer> kinda sucks to read once you're an adult
[6:01:13] <derap41> Its just a bit of media criticism
[6:01:24] <+MrAtheGreat> Pretty sure he was told to go back to the mural but I could be wrong @ingman112
[6:01:45] <%X2Eliah> So while Pat is away - is there any other figurine to give to dolores dei?
[6:01:49] <derap41> Considering what's popular today this is tame
[6:01:58] <heartlesshealer> the mural just told him that he'd need Kim. Hopefully pat remembers when he comes back and finishes the book
[6:02:03] <%VyperVic> @x2eliah in the wirral set
[6:02:08] <jaketherelapses> another final of this game o boy
[6:02:22] <%rumtumtugnutz> It did tell him to go to the mural, but he probly won't
[6:02:24] <%X2Eliah> @VyperVic oh, interesting
[6:02:24] <+MrAtheGreat> Oh wait, was it the mural on the feld building? I thought it was referring to the window but it could have been that
[6:02:34] <user_naim> Hjelmdallerman 2016 and Hjelmdallerman Eternal were my favorites
[6:02:37] <Turtleomertle> reload

[6:02:55] <Krisaeron> its gonna be only 1 more disco stream after this
[6:03:01] <jaketherelapses> It's the game that never ends
[6:03:06] <derap41> @user_naim But its ironic that means its ok right
[6:03:08] <heartlesshealer> I kinda half gave up on mainstream literature and am just working on reading through Stasheff's Wizard series. I'll for novels again after that
[6:03:15] <heartlesshealer> I'll look*
[6:03:18] <%X2Eliah> Tbh Pat is real close to being done with everything that can be done before the feld building event
[6:03:31] <Krisaeron> ye
[6:03:38] <DianaTheAscian> the what?
[6:03:45] <%ingman112> He could go now. I think he just wants to read enough books to finish internalizing the thought
[6:03:52] <Krisaeron> the thing with the REDACTED and then REDACTED
[6:03:57] <+JobbedBone> this is what excites me; from studio zaum's first blog post "w. The dream is to make a full form RPG after this one, but for now we consider No Truce a first bite. A smaller game to work out our big mechanics and storytelling methods."
[6:04:00] <heartlesshealer> ye he wants the thought
[6:04:10] <+MrAtheGreat> Yeah, I know what’s there, and shiver’s been directing him there, but I thought it was window that time. Like I said J could be wrong @ingman112
[6:04:17] <%X2Eliah> NO TRUCE WITH THE FURRIES
[6:04:27] <heartlesshealer> This is a SMALLER GAME for them???
[6:04:31] <derap41> FUCK THE FURRIES
[6:04:31] <%ingman112> Yeah nah shivers never says to go to the window, he's set for the church
[6:04:33] <Krisaeron> yiff the furries
[6:04:36] <derap41> Wait no

[6:04:49] <+lukausedsteal> YEAH FUCK THOSE FURRIES wait
[6:04:51] <%X2Eliah> @derap41 No don't fall for it that's what they want
[6:04:52] <%VyperVic> I don't see him ever wanting to stop the game after the PONR, so it'll likely only be one more steam
[6:04:52] <+JobbedBone> keep in mind they said this 6+ years ago, the scope may have expanded past what they meant at the time
[6:05:00] <user_naim> @derap41 Yeah, and Doomguy would never be mean to women
[6:05:03] <heartlesshealer> god I wanna know what they're gonna make after this
[6:05:09] <DianaTheAscian> that was fast

[6:05:37] <derap41> Let really get into this
[6:05:43] <%Monkeyweed21> this is really homoerotic
[6:05:45] <%X2Eliah> @PatStaresAt Pat this is not Schlock, this is pure unadultarated modern fantasy literature

[6:06:42] <terramagus> Zangief hates literature
[6:06:45] <Krisaeron> I kinda want some magic in Disco, and the SUPRA-NORMAL
[6:07:10] <heartlesshealer> @JobbedBone That sounds really interesting. Hope they can work it out without making the book too heavy for players to get through prior to play :0c
[6:07:17] <derap41> That took a turn
[6:07:18] <%X2Eliah> Wait he is fucking his bird now
[6:07:20] <%X2Eliah> ?

[6:27:41] <%Jeshk0> gesungheit
[6:27:55] <%athuramn> did he just pause to sneeze
[6:27:58] <%Ranryu692> weird that there are 2 separate window replacement businesses mentioned in this game
[6:27:58] <user_naim> ”Is this Andro Orlando?”
[6:28:04] <jacknerik> This voice is good
[6:28:10] <+PMAvers> Wait wait wait.
[6:28:13] <%athuramn> so polite oo
[6:28:14] <%red_cuppa> non-business hours for a 24 hr service?
[6:28:21] <%Urgotfantasy> the streets are very nice, they said they loved us
[6:28:22] <+PMAvers> Can we call that on the one phone on the boardwalk to get the window fixed in the Whirling?
[6:28:25] <$SGrim> @PatStaresAt 24h a week, not a day
[6:28:32] <aiutare47> did pat get the flavor text about this place?
[6:28:32] <+JobbedBone> yeah, you come to the business during the day
[6:28:40] <derap41> Isn't buisness hours just 8-16
[6:28:44] <%Jeshk0> what about that window you fucking broke???
[6:28:47] <terramagus> Didn't the dice maker say that the window business was a mob front?
[6:29:04] <aiutare47> yeah I dont remember if he got it or not
[6:29:19] <+JobbedBone> 24 hour might mean they get the window done in a day, remember that even conventions of turns-of-phrase are different in this world
[6:29:47] <NeroInfinite> OH NO
[6:29:49] <Zomner> monkaS
[6:29:51] <%miguelrod777> what
[6:29:52] <Dr_Mooose> wha?
[6:29:54] <derap41> oh fuck
[6:29:58] <zerointelligence000> this is pretty spooky
[6:30:04] <Krisaeron> MEGA HARDCORE
[6:30:10] <Detrius25> huh
[6:30:10] <terramagus> Place is haunted
[6:30:14] <xcompleasedad> There is NO logical answer to this
[6:30:14] <+emperri> pale in the machine
[6:30:16] <%superc37> oh this isnt real
[6:30:20] <heartlesshealer> Ummmm
[6:30:22] <derap41> Cursed as fuck
[6:30:26] <Krisaeron> There is a logical answer to this tho
[6:30:36] <+Havictos> oh man it's a recording listen to all the inteference
[6:30:41] <xcompleasedad> @Krisaeron Shhh
[6:30:41] <+MrAtheGreat> dive into those pale waves
[6:30:42] <+lukausedsteal> thats a ghost
[6:30:47] <%linSP> memory loss huh
[6:30:48] <+senfood> Oh, this is fucking spooky.
[6:30:48] <+lukausedsteal> 100% ghost
[6:30:57] <moonmeh> oh fuck
[6:31:05] <xcompleasedad> 2 is pretty good
[6:31:05] <Krisaeron> Spooke Creepy Intercoms - whispering in Harry's ear
[6:31:07] <+JobbedBone> @xcompleasedad what do you mean shhhh he just said the opposite of what you did LUL
[6:31:08] <%Fenrisulfr_V> Sounds like she took a big bath in the Pale.
[6:31:13] <moonmeh> did people working in the cursed district lose their memories as well
[6:31:15] <+MrAtheGreat> alternatively it's a recording or some shit
[6:31:22] <aiutare47> Doesnt Pat have a podcast to get to tomorrow? Its 2AM.
[6:31:23] <Detrius25> monkaS It's for you Harry
[6:31:26] <zerointelligence000> are ghosts a thing in this setting?
[6:31:27] <derap41> What did just happen
[6:31:33] <%SilvaChariot0133> well, now that you know what the Pale does to places
[6:31:33] <+MrAtheGreat> call again?
[6:31:36] <%bevyrage> do it again
[6:31:38] <xcompleasedad> @JobbedBone I was obfuscating the waters
[6:31:47] <Krisaeron> Ghosts? Kinda? I guess? Maybe? No? Although?
[6:32:01] <heartlesshealer> we have a world that eats and remakes itself on a whim occasionally. This game can totally have ghosts
[6:32:10] <+MrAtheGreat> The lady's name is gonna be Donna Dame I can feel it
[6:32:26] <RyoRyan92> I dunno about 'remakes'
[6:32:35] <+MrAtheGreat> MY GOT
[6:32:36] <Blank9> it's bourgeois physics
[6:32:42] <Krisaeron> Diane Dimmadome - Owner of the Dimmadame Dimmadome
[6:32:55] <+MrAtheGreat> LUL
[6:33:03] <derap41> no its a ghost
[6:33:03] <%Ranryu692> LUL
[6:33:04] <%athuramn> oh, this is sad
[6:33:06] <derap41> promise
[6:33:11] <+JobbedBone> the supernatural should be kept rare, don't want to spoil your universe with fantasy-creep
[6:33:20] <derap41> But it did have a real effect on you
[6:33:26] <%Ranryu692> you have all the information you need to figure out what's going on
[6:33:32] <Krisaeron> Fantasy-creep is the best
[6:34:08] <nazzynoeyes> When I spoke to this woman on my first playthrough I was so fucking creeped out I had to stop playing
[6:34:18] <digaogrunge> She also forgot
[6:34:19] <+MrAtheGreat> Cause you’re a Sorry Cop
[6:34:35] <Krisaeron> LUL
[6:34:52] <+emperri> @JobbedBone in fairness this is right across from where you start the game. pat is just going through all the supernatural stuff at once on day 5 or 6
[6:35:02] <+MrAtheGreat> DUCK ANOTHER DD
[6:35:03] <Robot_Nixon_> monkaS
[6:35:03] <derap41> hmm

[6:35:52] <%Foopoof> is shivers the princess beach of disco?
[6:35:57] <+mczarklesby> You already danced the last ball though.
[6:35:58] <Krisaeron> Zangiefs BALLS?

[6:36:08] <%AzureGale> LUL
[6:36:08] <%ingman112> So yeah Pale is FUUUUUUUCKED
[6:36:10] <spooksy> that might've happened already, in the church
[6:36:11] <+JobbedBone> @emperri I was half joking and just wanted to share the concept because I've thought of it before. In reality this game is really cool about it
[6:36:14] <%linSP> ball not like orb but like dancing
[6:36:19] <heartlesshealer> fair, Kim
[6:36:21] <%velemi> OUCH
[6:36:21] <Krisaeron> Woolie will never get the Urban Coochie LUL LUL LUL
[6:36:23] <RyoRyan92> I think you can talk to the dicemaker about this
[6:36:26] <rottingpastry> apparently it could be senior prom?
[6:36:34] <user_naim> Just stick your dick in the sand
[6:36:47] <+emperri> @JobbedBone ah. yeah I think in normal circumstances it's well paced. some people hardly come across it
[6:36:55] <%AzureGale> GHOST ROOM
[6:37:04] <+emperri> why garte?
[6:37:08] <%bread_assassin> Did we listen to all three stories from Idiot Doom Spiral?
[6:37:14] <%ingman112> Pale trapping recordings in the wires n shit
[6:37:18] <heartlesshealer> the only real person was cuno's prank victim
[6:37:28] <Krisaeron> Pale is spooky not gonna lie
[6:37:41] <+emperri> I think there's still a phasmid trap
[6:37:48] <+Havictos> @PatStaresAt Too bad you still redpilled Garte
[6:37:48] <%ingman112> Sounds like a plan
[6:37:49] <rottingpastry> wait why are we bloodborne?
[6:37:59] <heemwizard> you can fast travel
[6:38:05] <%Ranryu692> ye
[6:38:06] <%X2Eliah> sounds good
[6:38:10] <heartlesshealer> done until mural and the thing
[6:38:10] <+MrAtheGreat> You can tell Garte when you mention what’s behind the blue door iirc. That or it’s in the ‘saw something in the rags’
[6:38:13] <+emperri> fast travel has been broken for days
[6:38:15] <Krisaeron> The bloodborne was the Commundards we made along the way!
[6:38:19] <RushUnplugged> sadly no
[6:38:19] <+Mucmaster> fast travel is busted
[6:38:19] <%ingman112> You just need to BELIEVE pat. Let the plasm flow through you
[6:38:21] <+MrAtheGreat> No
[6:38:22] <PinkSocks> nah
[6:38:24] <+lukausedsteal> cant wait to catch up with the vod!\
[6:38:25] <+bulkninja> @PatStaresAt is this ur first play through?
[6:38:25] <Ardailec> No
[6:38:25] <%Ranryu692> not with the ending I got
[6:38:27] <derap41> not really
[6:38:27] <DianaTheAscian> god i wish
[6:38:27] <+MrAtheGreat> It has no epilogue like that
[6:38:27] <moonmeh> nope
[6:38:28] <+projectmanatees> nope
[6:38:28] <+icekept> no
[6:38:29] <penitentpendant> No
[6:38:29] <%X2Eliah> Fast travel breaks all the time
[6:38:29] <NeroInfinite> Nah

[6:38:31] <%gelatinous_cube> a little throuhg shivers
[6:38:32] <%X2Eliah> Well not really
[6:38:33] <teefpal> no
[6:38:33] <%Monkeyweed21> it depends
[6:38:36] <rottingpastry> Don't you forget about me
[6:38:37] <HeroToxiko> this isn't obsidian LUL
[6:38:41] <nazzynoeyes> The idea of the pale is literally scarier to me than anything in resident evil 8, bar from the baby of course.
[6:38:41] <faegbeard> garte went on to become sigma
[6:38:41] <derap41> but it does have resolutions for a lot of characters
[6:38:41] <%ingman112> @bulkninja This is his first playthrough
[6:38:41] <+emperri> @PatStaresAt there is a very limited post-credits ocelot call
[6:38:46] <televisedrevolting> "Harry continued and Kim went with"
[6:38:46] <+mczarklesby> ...SLIGHT Disagree with the nos. But, you know.
[6:38:47] <%X2Eliah> Klaasje did shoot a baby tho
[6:38:48] <heemwizard> hmm
[6:38:50] <Robot_Nixon_> Cuno goes to college and develops the cure to cancer POGGERS
[6:38:50] <heartlesshealer> you experience whatever harry experiences. Nothing outside of that
[6:38:51] <%X2Eliah> that's a thing
[6:39:02] <heemwizard> did he visit inside the feld building yet
[6:39:03] <+Mucmaster> Theres a fence between you and idiot doom spiral
[6:39:09] <%ingman112> "What do you do when I'm gone Harry?" "Wait for you to come back, Kim"
[6:39:14] <+lukausedsteal> cunoess gets rabbies
[6:39:18] <Pampaku> Idiot doom spiral <3
[6:39:20] <doc_ock_rokc> @heartlesshealer ... Shivers...
[6:39:36] <heartlesshealer> harry experiences the shivers :p
[6:39:41] <Krisaeron> Man fuck Cunoesse!
[6:39:43] <+Rofiarf> i think this is the guy the real estate agent in the apartment was talking about.
[6:39:51] <nazzynoeyes> This guy's voice VA is amazing.
[6:39:56] <%bassoontyphoon> Love his art
[6:40:17] <+emperri> I do like the VA they got for this guy
[6:40:33] <+MrAtheGreat> The Shit House
[6:40:38] <+emperri> color makes us hungry
[6:40:48] <penitentpendant> Sounds right
[6:40:56] <vilecrois> Sounds a lot like Plague tbh
[6:41:03] <+MrAtheGreat> Maybe he wants *you* to go to sleep. My cat screams when I stay up too late.
[6:41:04] <+emperri> bark baby
[6:41:07] <%ingman112> It DOES
[6:41:11] <derap41> We found ingame plauge
[6:41:17] <%Ranryu692> it's okay, he baby
[6:41:17] <%Pookiedaexzile> HE WILL HAVE HIS WARFARE
[6:41:20] <+MrAtheGreat> Speaking of I need to call it here. Good night guys n’ gals!
[6:41:21] <%Maids4lyfe> LUL
[6:41:22] <+emperri> why is the dog screaming
[6:41:26] <+emperri> why aren't you
[6:41:27] <+icekept> i like his voice
[6:41:31] <%ingman112> Plague of Gripes ain't that far off a name from Idiot Doom Spiral
[6:41:34] <heartlesshealer> have a good rest
[6:41:37] <nazzynoeyes> I love the way this game looks, the variation of so many different colours but all manage to look sad either way.
[6:41:37] <theanora1> Baby wants to the streamer
[6:41:43] <+Kyma1020> I'm glad I'm not the only one who thought he sounds like Plague
[6:41:49] <SomeAsianDood> wait is that the real reason idiot doom spiral collapsed? He made his fence too tall to jump over?
[6:42:01] <%Pookiedaexzile> Plague didn't go to shit, he was born in it
[6:42:17] <rottingpastry> resist capitalism
[6:42:26] <nazzynoeyes> Wankery :)

[6:43:23] <moonmeh> is the jacket made out of abestos
[6:43:26] <+emperri> @SomeAsianDood I think the point of the character is a shaggy dog story about his life fell apart in a comedy of errors but actually he was just kind of a hack and a dirtbag
[6:43:38] <+JobbedBone> jellyfish feels like pain
[6:43:43] <nazzynoeyes> ABIGAIL!
[6:43:51] <%Monkeyweed21> 15:50

[6:44:06] <derap41> That the shit jacket
[6:44:10] <%ingman112> Don't Call Abigail honestly has the best advice of the three of these bozos. And we already ignored it
[6:44:11] <SomeAsianDood> Yup, but I was just making a fence joke @emperri

[6:46:25] <nazzynoeyes> @doc_ock_rokc Good point
[6:46:27] <%ingman112> Why not? She was there, she knows
[6:46:27] <derap41> Shivers adds Imagined Narratives
[6:46:30] <+emperri> if it actually happened, sure

[6:48:37] <%Ranryu692> @Ranryu692 so he can stream new games instead, and also to play through at his own pace, rather than once or twice a week, I would assume

[6:53:28] <+JobbedBone> my theory is that theres a canon thought build and they have a special arrangement that draws a picture in the THC in the right order
[6:53:29] <%ingman112> Now I know this story kinda sucked. But the last one is worth it
[6:53:34] <$tuifuiegoeris> what if the horse bit his head off with the weird fuckin horse teeth

[6:58:31] <akitanito> no benefits from algul, but it's not like you drink it
[6:58:35] <+Astrobstrd> Damn you can be normal in a short amount of time!
[6:58:37] <%Pookiedaexzile> The game punishes you for sobriety just like real life
[6:58:41] <%ingman112> Ledger would offset that
[6:58:43] <Krisaeron> And thus - Boring Cop is born
[6:58:44] <%Ranryu692> maybe put a point back into physical instrument to get it back to four?
[6:58:44] <terramagus> Should get some more authority
[6:58:44] <$ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> +1 psyche is super huge

[6:59:20] <heartlesshealer> you have three skill points apparently. Remember them when you need them
[6:59:21] <+Daedalus119> it impresses yourself, says right there
[6:59:21] <ShaqAttackInABurlapSack> no?
[6:59:22] <PartyFavors> The sword DOES do something.
[6:59:22] <terramagus> It cuts the air
[6:59:22] <+mczarklesby> I think so?
[6:59:22] <penitentpendant> It gives a bonus in a quest
[6:59:22] <+Mucmaster> Sword looks cool
[6:59:22] <ShiningAxis> it impresses yourself
[6:59:23] <moonmeh> its cool
[6:59:23] <digaogrunge> Your ledger reduces it
[6:59:23] <xcompleasedad> Do you want ME to tell you?
[6:59:24] <Zomner> idk

[6:59:27] <UnfilteredComic> yes, one thing
[6:59:27] <GeneralOrangutan> gives a bonus for something
[6:59:28] <KaiserMario> Actually, maybe
[6:59:29] <+emperri> it's a minor bonus in a major check iirc
[6:59:30] <televisedrevolting> It might be useful in the building I think?
[6:59:30] <PartyFavors> Soon.
[6:59:31] <aiutare47> I think it just looks cool? If it does I never found it

[6:59:39] <%Pookiedaexzile> It cuts  thru dimensions
[6:59:43] <xcompleasedad> Yes?
[6:59:43] <%ingman112> No time
[6:59:44] <heartlesshealer> just wear the sword

[7:00:02] <JoshyJay> it kinda does something
[7:00:02] <%ingman112> I don't think that's right
[7:00:05] <moonmeh> ah yeah dude's tie is talkative

[7:00:50] <xcompleasedad> Yes
[7:00:52] <%SilvaChariot0133> hand/eye
[7:00:53] <rottingpastry> art cop must be an authority
[7:00:53] <%hax_metatron> Shivers?
[7:00:59] <$ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Your authority does not need to be 9?
[7:01:05] <jacknerik> Shivers is max
[7:01:06] <derap41> Half light or shivers
[7:01:07] <heartlesshealer> one left
[7:01:12] <%Urgotfantasy> PT or SF
[7:01:16] <jacknerik> Half light tho
[7:01:17] <%ingman112> Def PT
[7:01:17] <$Futurecity10> Put 1 in reaction speed for the hell of it
[7:01:19] <%hax_metatron> Save one
[7:01:19] <Krisaeron> SUGGESTION 6?
[7:01:21] <+Havictos> @PatStaresAt Electro isn't just for drugs by the way
[7:01:21] <+Mucmaster> Pain threshold
[7:01:23] <%hax_metatron> Save one for later
[7:01:24] <%X2Eliah> @PatStaresAt Pat your Zangief is boiling
[7:01:24] <Zomner> shivers is at MAX
[7:01:25] <%Pookiedaexzile> AUTHORITY TO 10
[7:01:25] <%ingman112> For this spread, at least
[7:01:26] <%bassoontyphoon> SAVE IT
[7:01:27] <terramagus> Suggestion IMO

[7:01:36] <%Monkeyweed21> @ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter he can offset it with the ledger
[7:01:39] <Zomner> save for reroll?
[7:01:40] <heartlesshealer> could save it for a quick load or something, idk
[7:01:40] <%hax_metatron> Save the point
[7:01:43] <%Pookiedaexzile> BE A BOSS ASS BITCH
[7:01:51] <ShaqAttackInABurlapSack> you're gonna want better suggestion
[7:02:03] <+emperri> @PatStaresAt double checked; sword is for when you go into Feld. not the thing I was thinking of with the tie
[7:02:04] <+mczarklesby> Actually yeah suggestion is solid.
[7:02:21] <heartlesshealer> time to save
[7:02:26] <+emperri> made of burger
[7:02:29] <jacknerik> Aww he big now
[7:02:32] <teefpal> We're super close
[7:02:38] <%AzureGale> Dog is happy he got attention
[7:02:38] <heartlesshealer> he baby <3
[7:02:38] <%ingman112> OOh new check
[7:02:39] <Oxybe> Geif is a mass of doog
[7:02:41] <%ingman112> Try that first
[7:02:45] <SomeAsianDood> something beautiful is going to happen
[7:02:48] <+Mucmaster> 1 first
[7:02:50] <xcompleasedad> @PatStaresAt So, instead of yelling, like an idiot, I'll ask. Have you called the station about the Hanged Man's ID number?
[7:02:50] <%hax_metatron> Good! But you’ll get even MORE skill points LUL
[7:02:51] <%ingman112> DO IT DO IT
[7:02:52] <NeroInfinite> both are high
[7:02:53] <%X2Eliah> aha
[7:02:57] <moonmeh> do it
[7:03:01] <heartlesshealer> you have harry with you
[7:03:01] <%SilvaChariot0133> shivers is the important one
[7:03:01] <Robot_Nixon_> [IMPOSSIBLE] But 97% LUL
[7:03:02] <%SilvaChariot0133> no
[7:03:04] <%Ranryu692> 1 is side quest, 3 is progress
[7:03:05] <%hax_metatron> Nowhere close to done; way more skill points to get LUL
[7:03:05] <xcompleasedad> Kinda
[7:03:05] <%gelatinous_cube> no
[7:03:05] <%ingman112> TRY IT OUT
[7:03:05] <%SilvaChariot0133> but it leads to it
[7:03:05] <Hellarussian> hmm
[7:03:10] <VVerewolfJones> What store do you buy your pants at?
[7:03:10] <$Futurecity10> Yes
[7:03:10] <+coolthulhuu> no
[7:03:10] <derap41> no
[7:03:10] <%ingman112> THE FIRST ONE
[7:03:11] <heemwizard> no you can still return
[7:03:11] <Blank9> no
[7:03:11] <Press_X_ToJASON> well
[7:03:11] <NeroInfinite> nah
[7:03:12] <dauver> no
[7:03:12] <librettodude> It's one of
[7:03:13] <%gelatinous_cube> kim literally tells you
[7:03:13] <SolSwagGuy56> :)
[7:03:13] <$bognugget> not quite, but almost
[7:03:14] <Zomner> IDK
[7:03:15] <%sunsetdisc0> no, it's inside
[7:03:15] <%X2Eliah> Not quite
[7:03:15] <%Ranryu692> it's not quite the point of no return, but it's critical path
[7:03:15] <+rusefus> not quite
[7:03:15] <%AzureGale> 3 is the woolie nut prompt
[7:03:15] <teefpal> No, it's a bit further
[7:03:16] <%Urgotfantasy> WHO IS TO SAY
[7:03:16] <+emperri> @xcompleasedad it's like day 6 he's done all this
[7:03:16] <Tisaric> not quite but nearly
[7:03:17] <aiutare47> No
[7:03:17] <%SilvaChariot0133> it will tell you when the point of no return it
[7:03:18] <SomeAsianDood> no but yes
[7:03:18] <+icekept> no
[7:03:20] <%Monkeyweed21> PAST THE POINT OF NO RETURN
[7:03:21] <+Mucmaster> well kinda
[7:03:21] <derap41> noes
[7:03:21] <%Mendin> It unlocks the path to the PoNR
[7:03:22] <aiutare47> Its progress
[7:03:22] <+RoByte2> The point of no return is near, but the game will be quite clear where it actually is
[7:03:24] <librettodude> No, this is Progression
[7:03:24] <xcompleasedad> You can back out
[7:03:24] <LeotheHuntsman> just make a choice
[7:03:26] <teefpal> you can do it,
[7:03:26] <%sunsetdisc0> kim will tell you when
[7:03:27] <moonmeh> jsut start off with 1
[7:03:27] <heartlesshealer> kim needed for shivers, encyclopedia is also a thing you can do
[7:03:27] <+stoutfish> None of these are red
[7:03:28] <aiutare47> but not HARD progress
[7:03:28] <$bognugget> Kim will straight up tell you
[7:03:28] <%Monkeyweed21> THE FINAL THRESHOLD
[7:03:28] <ShaqAttackInABurlapSack> it'll tell you pretty obviously when you hit it
[7:03:31] <%SilvaChariot0133> like 10 minutes
[7:03:32] <moonmeh> very close
[7:03:33] <$Futurecity10> @PatStaresAt Inside the building is the point of no return
[7:03:33] <Zomner> just do both
[7:03:33] <LeotheHuntsman> steps
[7:03:33] <%ingman112> About 15 minutes
[7:03:35] <+Mucmaster> It'll tell you when you hit the point of no return
[7:03:35] <xcompleasedad> About 15 minutes
[7:03:35] <aiutare47> close but not here
[7:03:36] <penitentpendant> Close
[7:03:36] <%ingman112> Maybe 2
[7:03:36] <+newbroxes> pretty close
[7:03:37] <SomeAsianDood> 20min
[7:03:38] <Press_X_ToJASON> you've got a bit
[7:03:38] <+mczarklesby> 45 seconds
[7:03:38] <%Pookiedaexzile> 9 hours
[7:03:38] <PartyFavors> Like 10 minutes
[7:03:38] <+Havictos> It's for when you've learned all you need to
[7:03:38] <%ingman112> *20
[7:03:38] <%gelatinous_cube> through that building one area
[7:03:38] <%sunsetdisc0> it's inside. kim will tell you when
[7:03:39] <%Ranryu692> 10-20
[7:03:39] <%Sveargieth> The game will warn you
[7:03:39] <$ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Kim will tell you
[7:03:39] <+rusefus> close
[7:03:40] <derap41> About 20 meters
[7:03:40] <%X2Eliah> @PatStaresAt Both are two ways to progress
[7:03:40] <+JobbedBone> 20 min
[7:03:41] <+redyoshi5> like 10-20 min
[7:03:41] <teefpal> As a spoiler, the game will explicitly tell you
[7:03:42] <%Monkeyweed21> very close
[7:03:42] <UnfilteredComic> a ways
[7:03:43] <heemwizard> 15 mins
[7:03:44] <%Pookiedaexzile> 2 hours
[7:03:45] <%Mendin> 5-10min
[7:03:45] <%X2Eliah> about 15 minutes
[7:03:45] <PinkSocks> youve still got a bit
[7:03:46] <fatalDestiny> This decision, and the scene it leads to is the PONR
[7:03:49] <%hax_metatron> The game very clearly says the point of no return don’t worry
[7:03:49] <heartlesshealer> soon™
[7:03:50] <NeekoFM> 10 mins maybw
[7:03:50] <+emperri> @PatStaresAt there's a soft and a hard point of no return
[7:03:53] <Robot_Nixon_> 20 minoot
[7:03:55] <bakkatohri> The point of return might be when you have to enter an entirely new area.
[7:03:57] <digaogrunge> You can get to it in 5 minutes
[7:04:00] <%bassoontyphoon> 1 hour
[7:04:05] <theanora1> you will never be free of this game
[7:04:23] <UnfilteredComic> amogus
[7:04:34] <+emperri> this is soft no-return. hard no-return the game will literally hold your hand and say "this is the end of the game go finish these side quests if you care"
[7:04:36] <taeko_ohnuki> stop hitting le dog
[7:05:08] <xcompleasedad> Is this a glitch?
[7:05:21] <heemwizard> damnn bug
[7:05:23] <xcompleasedad> This is almost identical to the other one?
[7:05:23] <%X2Eliah> this is normal
[7:05:29] <+JobbedBone> process of elimination LUL
[7:05:42] <dbag202> This is clever
[7:05:43] <Robot_Nixon_> Recap Pog
[7:05:46] <xcompleasedad> @X2Eliah Huh.
[7:05:52] <xcompleasedad> OH
[7:05:56] <xcompleasedad> I get it now.
[7:05:58] <+tigerfang86> encyclopedia popping off
[7:05:59] <Dr_Mooose> ?
[7:06:12] <xcompleasedad> This helps with the thing the sword helps with, right?
[7:06:21] <%ingman112> So this is a way to get in if the Shivers Check is too difficult or gets softlocked
[7:06:24] <xcompleasedad> YES
[7:06:31] <moonmeh> yeah
[7:06:31] <Zomner> YUP
[7:06:34] <aiutare47> yeah you side steped the shivers
[7:06:34] <%Pookiedaexzile> Bitch you thought it was a game
[7:06:34] <+emperri> this is getting into the building
[7:06:38] <moonmeh> i skipped the firstpart accidentally
[7:06:38] <heartlesshealer> <3
[7:06:39] <terramagus> This is in case you fail the Shivers check, so you don't get soft-locked
[7:06:40] <Robot_Nixon_> monkaS

[7:16:57] <+emperri> wack ass crystal prison
[7:16:58] <%Jeshk0> so is pat still missing the helmet?
[7:17:06] <Krisaeron> yes
[7:17:19] <%Ranryu692> @holydeviant1 Pat's only going up to the point where Kim says you might want to wrap everything else up
[7:17:20] <%Jeshk0> isnt it pretty easy to find tho?
[7:17:20] <johnchikr> @hattrick61 I'd imagine that Harry will implode with that much level of conflict
[7:17:20] <dbag202> F Cuno
[7:17:21] <heemwizard> @Jeshk0 you mean the fairweather one
[7:17:29] <+emperri> @Jeshk0 getting the helmet is literally one of the last things you do in the game
[7:17:29] <heemwizard> you dont get it right now
[7:17:31] <%Ranryu692> @holydeviant1 which is right before that
[7:17:32] <%hax_metatron> I feel like chat contributed to Pat staying up way past today LUL
[7:17:49] <johnchikr> @Ranryu692 Huh when does he do that?
[7:17:53] <johnchikr> ohh nvm
[7:17:56] <%X2Eliah> Er no the flashing is right after the warning
[7:17:58] <%holydeviant1> @holydeviant1 Yeah and the pale thing is before that
[7:17:59] <Krisaeron> We are Pat's PARTY BOYS TO THE MEGA!
[7:18:06] <%Ranryu692> @johnchikr the end of the hallway Pat just entered
[7:18:08] <%X2Eliah> The game warns you, then if you keep moving onward you get to the flashing
[7:18:11] <johnchikr> Haaad coooah

[7:18:45] <Krisaeron> Yo anybody wanna do some RAFFLES?
[7:18:48] <heemwizard> did he solve the mystery of the church yet?
[7:18:54] <%X2Eliah> Ohnooo that is way too far ahead
[7:19:05] <%athuramn> lol literally everyone who said "10 mins" are the same people who show up late to everything in life
[7:19:06] <%X2Eliah> @heemwizard ye
[7:19:16] <heemwizard> cool
[7:19:24] <$RealThiele> woolie dimension 10 mins
[7:19:41] <%X2Eliah> No but the Ruby thing *is* point of no return. Because it triggers the next stuff
[7:19:53] <+emperri> just realized the guy who made this song was the guy who did the BITCH BITCH BITCH remix of sins of the father
[7:19:58] <+MightyDuckShoes> squeeze that loaf, Pat. I believe in you.
[7:20:22] <$RealThiele> suplex the shit out of your dog
[7:20:42] <+emperri> I would put this at a minimum of 3 hours from the end
[7:20:55] <%X2Eliah> @athuramn It would be well over by now if Pat didn't go to take a leak
[7:21:18] <+emperri> if you spam advanced text maybe you could get it in an hour
[7:21:25] <%hax_metatron> @emperri There’s tons of LONG conversations ahead. I’m putting it at 5-6 hours
[7:21:43] <%sunsetdisc0> i cant stay awake any longer, gonna have to watch the vod. goodnight y'all
[7:21:45] <heemwizard> did he arrest klassje?
[7:21:48] <Krisaeron> yeah next part after REDACTED gonna be a long haul to the end

[7:22:32] <%Mendin> Flashlight off, sword on time
[7:22:35] <Dr_Mooose> dog empty now
[7:22:37] <Krisaeron> all this time Gief was yelling: AH NEEDS TAH TEHKS AH SHIT
[7:22:47] <akitanito> comrade!
[7:22:50] <%holydeviant1> So yeah, STROBING SHIT AND WHAT NOT warning ahead if you keep going to the Whirling In Rags PONR
[7:23:08] <%Pookiedaexzile> Armed Combat is required

[7:23:20] <nahmercy> oh shit we here
[7:23:26] <%holydeviant1> woah shivers
[7:23:30] <$RealThiele> bang
[7:23:30] <johnchikr> That kinda looks like Harry
[7:23:36] <fedemachado96> jesus...
[7:23:50] <riuk_alter> psaPorgmo
[7:24:39] <%GarbageNirvana> So is -ard supposed to denote something in a certain language?
[7:24:40] <%ingman112> Should be a dot here as well now
[7:24:45] <%ingman112> Walk around a bit
[7:24:46] <%GarbageNirvana> I don't think I've ever seen it as often as I do in this game
[7:24:56] <heemwizard> did he pass the shivers check to get polar anorak shirt
[7:25:04] <akitanito> save?
[7:25:08] <lol_red_ranger> he clicked the dot by the window but it didn't count for the thing
[7:25:10] <lol_red_ranger> wtf
[7:25:13] <%X2Eliah> There's your point of (soft) no return @PatStaresAt . Right there.
[7:25:19] <%ingman112> He can go back on the way out
[7:25:22] <+Damie904> You may wanna take ur gun out
[7:25:22] <+Mucmaster> PONR
[7:25:25] <%ingman112> We'll remind him
[7:25:26] <%hax_metatron> This is such a Baldur’s Gate type layout
[7:25:26] <dbag202> This is becoming slight horror
[7:25:29] <$RealThiele> Doctor bees?
[7:25:35] <heemwizard> yeah you can still go back
[7:25:38] <digaogrunge> THIS IS THE POINT
[7:25:44] <BurlyBeef> Oh no it's The Pain
[7:25:48] <dbag202> Oh man
[7:25:51] <%Ranryu692> guys, the game literaly tells him it's the point of no return, you don't need to point it out lol
[7:25:52] <+emperri> there's not much to go back for
[7:25:53] <aiutare47> @GarbageNirvana In this instance Communard refers to the people of the Commune of France, im guessing the writers liked the word
[7:25:53] <%bevyrage> this is a hard point of no return.
[7:25:54] <Krisaeron> Dudes - chill, let Pat play
[7:25:58] <+emperri> he did kinda everything
[7:26:03] <+tigerfang86> monkaS
[7:26:07] <%bevyrage> this is also the point where you'd want to save and quit the stream btw
[7:26:09] <%GarbageNirvana> Ah, so it IS French
[7:26:09] <%hax_metatron> THE GAME WILL TELL HIM chat NotLikeThis stay calm
[7:26:11] <dbag202> Turning point?
[7:26:11] <%bassoontyphoon> Sword
[7:26:11] <+icekept> this is it
[7:26:14] <%bevyrage> gotta get to sleep for the podcast
[7:26:16] <%X2Eliah> @Ranryu692 Look we've seen Woolie play games on stream, you can never be too careful with streamers
[7:26:28] <Krisaeron> backseat gaehming
[7:26:28] <CryoByjorne> game saying this is the point of no return
[7:26:43] <+tigerfang86> DANG
[7:26:50] <%holydeviant1> yeah it tells you if there's a point to turning around
[7:26:53] <penitentpendant> Sidequest checklist
[7:26:58] <librettodude> This is the point of Happening, but not necessarily No Return
[7:26:59] <+MightyDuckShoes> is there a Keep Calm Volition shirt out there?
[7:27:00] <dbag202> Recaping everything here
[7:27:01] <heartlesshealer> <3
[7:27:11] <%hax_metatron> The game checklisting for you
[7:27:12] <%ingman112> That's not a bad idea actually
[7:27:16] <+emperri> (it doesn't matter)
[7:27:34] <%holydeviant1> @MightyDuckShoes I want a FUCKING PANIC - STAB EVERYONE half light shirt
[7:27:34] <%athuramn> and this soft point is irrelevant because he's literally done everything else
[7:27:39] <RushUnplugged> the game literally tells you "hey, you have this thing still open, this other route is done", it's great
[7:27:58] <$RealThiele> fortune and glory kid
[7:28:04] <%ingman112> Now SAVE HERE
[7:28:15] <%holydeviant1> @athuramn eh, there's like one more klaasje interview

[7:28:56] <%GarbageNirvana> It's the last chance you'll get
[7:28:57] <moonmeh> if it bugs u you can do it
[7:28:58] <%ingman112> Either way save here
[7:29:00] <xcompleasedad> It will take too long and make things fucky
