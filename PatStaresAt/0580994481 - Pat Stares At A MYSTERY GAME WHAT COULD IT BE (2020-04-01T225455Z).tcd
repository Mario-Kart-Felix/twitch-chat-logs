[0:34:47] <mrcelab> @PatStaresAt Hey Pat, How are You with the all the Corona Virus out there in Canada? Its quite rough in Latvia out here to be honest. I don't know how it is there, but even the police is driving around and telling people to keep distance. And it is not a joke, even if You are in your own car with 2 people, like 3 people in car, You get 2k Euro fine instant. No joke.
[0:34:47] <gameever> You'll be fine mate, just don't puncture it. You can attempt to degass pouch batteries, I've had coworkers who've done it in the past, but I haven't done it so I can't say for sure the orders to do it
[0:34:48] <lilmac64> But what if there is not Glory, and they're fighting for freedom? Is that any better?
[0:34:50] <buffmurffy> has pat ever played blitz the league 2? that's the best bloodsports simulator
[0:34:51] <%MonsieurHedge> consent is absolutely important
[0:34:52] <lloyddboy> athletes don't sub to pat
[0:34:53] <%toastybites> I am glad that Pat is back to finish off Minecraft: Story Mode.
[0:34:55] <%valriot> Battery Sports
[0:34:57] <shouttothevoid> bloodsports is a meme a chatter potentially maiming themselves isn't
[0:34:57] <%shiplord13> I just pictued the real General Patton blowing up with laptop battery
[0:34:58] <%trllly> What i did with my old laptop was I took out the 1000 gigabyte hard drive to use as an external hard drive and then I tossed that shit in the garbage because Danger!
[0:35:01] <+konekoryugamine> No one likes pain into themselves
[0:35:04] <BalloniWright> get used to it LUL
[0:35:04] <majima666> pat stares at shenmue.....bring it on
[0:35:06] <SovPho> "Where's the line" implies the existence of a line, of where there is none. Blood sport is acceptable given the correct circumstances and violence is unacceptable for the same.

[1:19:59] <%RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt problem is, economic stimulus money is designed to be SPENT. If you stick it in the bank you're actually making things worse. They want everybody to spend it, so that it pumps cash on a local level, which allows businesses to pay their employees, which allows those employees to spend, and so on and so forth. Kevin Rudd did it back in the '08 crisis and it pretty much halted that recession in its tracks for us.

It isn't true, Japan literally has the same kind of constitution as the U.S. Japanese prosecutors just get more control of the case so they drop way more cases than in the U.S.

[2:30:38] <+DiabloDeAzul> @RubberFistFight That's symbolism wankery. If the game can't make a statement or a difference in your choices, who's to say that the layman would even get it, or if the writer intended it? At least a game like Paper Mario can say "I'm not gonna save the world" and end the game there
[2:30:40] <%RubberFistFight> @Lion_kun P4 was very hard and had some pretty shitting RNG, like battles where you could get flat-out murdered before you even got a chance to pick an action.

[3:10:49] <fragdar> drink a shot yall
[3:10:53] <%CommanderSqueaks> If a Persona game doesn't have a powerful bromance, can you even call it a Persona?
[3:10:56] <%Hobojo153> In terms of things I actually like. I love the new boarder effect in the palaces. (The fractals on the edge of the screen)
[3:10:59] <%RubberFistFight> @CloniiCory Yosuke's kind of a prick isn't he.

[3:17:38] <%TheWinged7> Whoo, lookin' cool Joker
[3:17:38] <%CommanderSqueaks> @SinisterBroccoli Maybe a New Game + thing?
[3:17:39] <%RubberFistFight> @CygnusRoboticus 5 is probably where they refined the combat formula to the point where it wasn't super unforgiving or RNG heavy. It's a good series, but the earlier you go, the rougher/harder they are.
[3:17:39] <%asgard147> SourPls
[3:17:39] <+NitronStreams> animal sidekick are all terrible
[3:17:41] <chancho4tierra> teddy is not better than morgana in any way

[3:18:09] <%baronblank> once you get makoto, using morgana is just replaced both character and mechanic wise
[3:18:09] <%RubberFistFight> @luckysteak teddy just wants to fuck everything that moves.

[3:20:34] <+gimmickypizza> cuphead Giant bomb has lost her touch
[3:20:34] <%RubberFistFight> @ShockzNDrawe sure, but she's still a natural blonde, which topples the contention that "japanese think natural blonde doesn't exist".
[3:20:35] <figleafplays> eh
[3:20:36] <%LaughingCatt> Thats actually fair competition
[3:20:37] <SubjectTea> i fucking hate how dream daddy made it on top 10 and not yakuza

[3:20:41] <%stagemage> i disagree but i can see that
[3:20:42] <BurdRightsActivist> Cuphead > P5 4Head
[3:20:43] <+D00msDayDan> if there was a game for persona to lose to
[3:20:43] <Ranger747> Cuphead also won best visuals, which is about right, but dude, this style
[3:20:44] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> just like Paige
[3:20:44] <%arancet> not fair, no offfense to cuphead
[3:20:44] <olaksi> wanted to get mad but couldn't
[3:20:45] <%bread_assassin> I disagree, but I won't fight it.
[3:20:45] <dukenux> strong competition

[3:20:54] <dead_harmony13> P5 is better cuz it's not based
[3:20:54] <%MonsieurHedge> big disagree purse ownership > cuphead
[3:20:54] <%TheDullaMAN> Gotta go fast
[3:20:54] <Artista_AF> losing to CupHead? ok fair enough
[3:20:55] <%rumtumtugnutz> This game is stylized, but cuphead is more stylish.
[3:20:55] <%mankeyfigh> Ryuji you dumbass
[3:20:55] <arkv01> we need to GAST
[3:20:57] <„Éü„É•„Ç¶„É¨4242> who cares what some paid review site says?

[4:04:40] <%dyslexicwizrad> where are the zambies tho
[4:04:41] <%CokeMilkRequiem> PUT THE MASK ON PATG
[4:04:41] <+Sir_Dolphinian> im so happy this smash bros OC can finally get his own adventure!
[4:04:42] <Monkeyweed21> comes with big penis outfit
[4:04:42] <%ahdurian> PAT'S RICH
[4:04:43] <+rytyoung> Nice to see Smash Bros give this starting up game some spotlight...
[4:04:44] <%Keyd00d> he jebaited us all
[4:04:44] <%Run44forrest> PogO
[4:04:45] <%CokeMilkRequiem> PUT IT ON
[4:04:46] <+Soulsbjorne> put the mask on
[4:04:46] <%Dragon_Batman> @RubberFistFight oh kool, I still haven't played P4G so I never knew.
[4:04:47] <CaptainKarite> Chat, we get outfits later
[4:04:47] <%WhereIsWill> why won't Atlus put these on the switch tho!?
[4:04:48] <%Hobojo153> Physical you mean?
[4:04:49] <+AgadezXX> put the mask on
[4:04:50] <%CokeMilkRequiem> IT CAME WITH IT
[4:04:50] <%GarbageNirvana> I mean does it just get you outfits or
[4:04:53] <YakumoYomi> I mean...went through about 95% of the regular encounters in the game by attacking from behind. It's really easy to sneak up on enemies.
[4:04:56] <%Run44forrest> full playthrough tho? RIGHT?
[4:04:57] <%spiritofmojave> Pat's LODED
[4:04:58] <TheShockVox> Keep in mind pat has BAD MUSIC TASTE AND HATES MUSIC. He thinks they come from underground is the best track in Anarchy Reigns
[4:04:58] <%SWFanatic> we live inside a dream
[4:04:59] <%CokeMilkRequiem> oh okay
[4:05:04] <%Hobojo153> Oh so not the cool mask one
[4:05:04] <%RubberFistFight> @hepheros P4G is an improvement. It's still a bit rough. The combat RNG is blatantly unfair at times.
[4:05:05] <%baronblank> I feel like I am very much in the minority when I say I think Reach Out to the Truth is the best theme
[4:05:05] <deviljhojho_> Coward
[4:05:08] <+Soulsbjorne> booooo
[4:05:09] <fragdar> daaaamn.. so many new reactions faces in this version uh?

[4:05:18] <OlavOlavsson> So did Atlus finally loosen up on the restriction bs
[4:05:18] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt but physical games are an essential business
[4:05:19] <deviljhojho_> LITERALLY for life
[4:05:19] <%Run44forrest> widepeepoSad no joker statue for cumjar

[4:09:30] <Monkeyweed21> Haru is AMAZING tho
[4:09:30] <SilverJakler> That's like everyone's team
[4:09:30] <%Andrizzleton> Best party
[4:09:31] <%Quigsies> Good party
[4:09:31] <Bguy32> same
[4:09:31] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Ann hits like a truck though
[4:09:32] <+lazygertt> same team
[4:09:32] <deviljhojho_> top tier party is ann, ryuji and a healer
[4:09:34] <+blademaster247> Team Harem I see
[4:09:34] <Swish20XX> Same. Sometimes Ann
[4:09:34] <nox_nyctores> Actually using Makoto DansGame
[4:09:34] <%Hellarussian> thats crazy but who asked
[4:09:35] <CaptainKarite> That's some big boy damage there
[4:09:35] <+fallenlogan> just joined did Pat name Joker Bobby Hill?
[4:09:36] <%Dragon_Batman> Really?
[4:09:38] <%FacetiousAF> makoto gives me the big... mamoru
[4:09:41] <quietshun> Same but haru instead of Yusuke
[4:09:42] <%mechslayer71> Same I think
[4:09:42] <$Dakuu75> we haven't even gotten to the super-fucked-up shit yet
[4:09:44] <%spiritofmojave> Haru's fucking solid tho
[4:09:44] <CaptainKarite> Kasumi for sure
[4:09:45] <striberx> @PatStaresAt My team was Morgana, Makoto, and Haru.
[4:09:47] <$Cobra743> Makoto, Ryuji, and Haru
[4:09:47] <%Shadicara> Lmao makoto
[4:09:47] <+lazygertt> they are the best
[4:09:48] <+Solutha> just use em all
[4:09:49] <%bread_assassin> Same, but replace Yusuke with either Ann or Haru depending on the situation.
[4:09:50] <+icekept> not me
[4:09:50] <+Sir_Dolphinian> i had Ann the whole time for... reasons
[4:09:50] <Lucasleonava> Ryuji is strong
[4:09:50] <%genowyn> Best team is Ann Ryuji Makoto for dps
[4:09:51] <DuoScratch> HEY, That's MY team too!
[4:09:52] <%optimasmaximas> lady ann
[4:09:52] <%Agami23> anne can get SUPER strong
[4:09:53] <%Hobojo153> Most don't use Makoto in base at least actually since she's the all rounder
[4:09:53] <$Chimeraelite> awesome
[4:09:53] <+pyrojack6> instead of yusuke it was morgana because he larns salvation
[4:09:53] <alphonseisbest> YAY
[4:09:55] <Ultimatefool> NEW GIRL
[4:09:55] <+Sathelan1> Is p5r worth it? I beat p5 already...
[4:09:56] <V0idWaIker> Same but Ann instead of Ryuji
[4:09:57] <%Run44forrest> morgana DansGame
[4:09:57] <Noelle808> Anne is dope
[4:09:58] <Dral54> Morgana sucks, ann is good tho
[4:09:58] <%SparkAfterDark> the team has to be who you want to smooch
[4:09:59] <dead_harmony13> I keep Morgana cuz he's a good healer
[4:09:59] <+brightman42> I switched Ann and Makoto a lot
[4:10:00] <%redrins> not haru tho
[4:10:01] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> what about Light?
[4:10:01] <fragdar> in the last boss, ann is so good
[4:10:01] <Arccun> Ann was great bc Concentrate
[4:10:02] <%Andrizzleton> Ann's charm is great
[4:10:02] <%starotter70> Ann's a POWERFUL Mage
[4:10:02] <quietshun> Haru gun skills man
[4:10:03] <+SpicyCheeseNips> I always just swap characters out periodically.
[4:10:04] <%TheSniperJoe> Nice save PAt.
[4:10:05] <%xsnowfox> so APPARENTLY bringing SWORDS to a FOOD COURT is AGAINST THE LAW now
[4:10:05] <+linSP> cat is stinky
[4:10:06] <%trustycoyote> Ann can do some damage
[4:10:08] <striberx> @Sathelan1 Yes it is.
[4:10:09] <%RyanTheRecluse> I rocked Anne, Makoto and Ryuuji. Swapping Morgan with Anne whenever she was close to dying.
[4:10:10] <%genowyn> Only Ann and Ryuji get mind/power charge respectively so they are essential for big number
[4:10:11] <CaptainKarite> Haru is also big damage
[4:10:12] <nox_nyctores> Can you imagine Haru with screentime though?
[4:10:15] <Frostydough1> I mean you dont HAVE to hang out with morgana
[4:10:15] <%arancet> i swapped morg/ann/ryuji with makoto/haru/yusuke
[4:10:15] <doodledumps> Ryuji, Ann, and Makoto for me
[4:10:16] <%Run44forrest> i wish you didnt have to hang out with akechi.. fuck that bitch
[4:10:20] <%PauliusMaximus> Ann is great at endgame in vanilla
[4:10:20] <+skylerpilot> too bad Makoto ends up really weak in the original game
[4:10:20] <AntChodeny> I heard the new character is way late into the game
[4:10:21] <%tinyswampthing> mine was morgana haru and ryuji
[4:10:22] <+rottingpastry> I'm sorry I thought this was america
[4:10:22] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> I usually ran the Boys Lockeroom and Harem Joker
[4:10:23] <„Éü„É•„Ç¶„É¨4242> so we can enjoy all of ann's battle lines and animations.
[4:10:25] <%spiritofmojave> i HOPE Haru gets time
[4:10:27] <SyLuX45> Morgana is fast but that‚Äôs about it he‚Äôs a speedy support
[4:10:28] <SilverJakler> Hairu
[4:10:29] <fragdar> AoE damage is way to good in the last boss
[4:10:31] <extradopeness> I ran joker fox Mona panther
[4:10:32] <doodledumps> Ann has the highest magic DPS in OG game
[4:10:32] <ECRead> I used Haru for reflecting attacks
[4:10:37] <%Hellarussian> nice
[4:10:37] <%Hobojo153> Not really.
[4:10:41] <striberx> I only had Morgana for the heals.
[4:10:42] <+Pookiedaexzile> You gonna fuck the Teacher tho right
[4:10:43] <%jiin6> Pat's spoiling it all
[4:10:44] <%SWFanatic> alphys?
[4:10:45] <%Hobojo153> Because new girl is like Naoto
[4:10:47] <%Moave> Moave subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! I'm currently doing 1/2 days at my job due to the virus. So I'm studying for my history major.

[4:10:51] <DuoScratch> I really wish you got your party a lot earlier, but you found out about their problems as you went along.
[4:10:52] <%Dragon_Batman> Neat, Haru is pretty great
[4:10:52] <%Shadicara> You can use whoever you want long as you make joker as bent as possible LUL

[4:28:24] <+kongx24> Ryuji is the best husbando
[4:28:24] <%spiritofmojave> Exactly
[4:28:24] <theloganbrand> He's not a yes man either
[4:28:26] <%Keyd00d> Yosuke was a closet gay

[4:28:34] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> again, not a phobia, it's bigotry
[4:28:35] <Bguy32> it's pretty obvious

[4:28:46] <+Pookiedaexzile> Wait what
[4:28:51] <%bread_assassin> Yosuke says some things where Kanji totally should have punched him out,
[4:28:52] <+CrescentRubyRose> Maybe they were going with Ryuji being Kanji 2.0

[4:29:12] <%baronblank> THANK YOU
[4:29:14] <neVan0> oh YEAH
[4:29:14] <%RubberFistFight> Man, that kinda blew me away that one moment Yosuke was SUPER nasty to Kanji, I was like "alright, guess who's no longer on my team ever again".
[4:29:14] <Fujiwara_92> Junpei is great with FeMC
[4:29:15] <%jiin6> Ryuji is the same as Junpei

[4:29:26] <%Deano8817> oh wait, I can't speak for portable
[4:29:26] <%Keyd00d> Yeah and then he gets character development
[4:29:28] <%Piemen99> SIMP
[4:29:28] <%kewlmyc> Junpei is great because the game acknowledges he's a piece of shit and he changes.
[4:29:29] <theloganbrand> Junpei is good actually. He has growth. Unlike Yosuke.
[4:29:29] <%spiritofmojave> Stupei
[4:29:30] <%Shadicara> Fuck sake simpei LUL
[4:29:31] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> 2009 was a long time ago
[4:29:32] <Klefth> Dude, sometimes I wish Junpei's evoker was a real fucking gun
[4:29:32] <mankeytennis> Junpei is the least likable
[4:29:33] <%Deano8817> but he's the saving grace of the answer
[4:29:33] <+tigerfang86> but he's still cooler than Yosuke
[4:29:34] <ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> He's only Super bad in Fem Protag, kind of sad
[4:29:35] <%Keyd00d> That's what's good about the P3 characters
[4:29:35] <+jjjdanny> Stupei ü§¢
[4:29:37] <+Pookiedaexzile> Pat jut hates himself
[4:29:37] <Aydarkzero> i stopped playing P3 after an hour couldn't get into it
[4:29:37] <+Solutha> gonna cry? maybe shit and cum?
[4:29:38] <kratosdestroys> He was probably one of the saner ones in The Answer though funny enough
[4:29:38] <+MisterRockett> I feel like Yukiko insulting him every single time he opened his mouth was even more annoying for longer.
[4:29:39] <Fujiwara_92> nah, he with FeMC is like a bro sis thing, it's cool
[4:29:41] <%Dragon_Batman> Junpei has moments but overall yea is isn't great
[4:29:42] <%rdark_ksu> Why would that matter?
[4:29:44] <+pyrojack6> DOESN'T HELP THAT JUNPEI IS VOICED BY VIC MINGONA
[4:29:45] <olaksi> He thought he was a the shounen hero by virtue of being the only guy
[4:29:50] <Joestar1890> Junpei was annoying for like half of the game, Yosuke was annoying in certain scenes
[4:29:53] <Arccun> bo, he's great, he become's hamuko's best bud
[4:29:55] <Mordexai0> Yeah but the game points out he's a dumb fuck so that's good
[4:29:56] <SilverJakler> Who do you think would voice Junpei now that Vic has been canceled?
[4:29:58] <+jjjdanny> that's Vic? LMAO
[4:29:58] <+tigerfang86> @pyrojack6 OH GOD I FORGOT NOOOOOOO

[4:30:00] <%RubberFistFight> @Joestar1890
[4:30:02] <+pkmamsters> Junpei's the opposite of a simp but not a chad
[4:30:05] <+HodouVAN> Junpei has the best platonic social link with FeMC if you do his and he turns into your best bro
[4:30:05] <TheShockVox> @pyrojack6 Caaaaareful.....
[4:30:07] <ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Ohhh MAN
[4:30:09] <Klefth> @pyrojack6 Jesus, how can anyone stand playing P3 with the English dub?
[4:30:12] <Monkeyweed21> OH GOD NOT VIC
[4:30:15] <Vashido22> @PatStaresAt Junpei's the best in P3P
[4:30:16] <%RubberFistFight> @Joestar1890 Yosuke was more than annoying though, that's the problem.
[4:30:17] <%Masutasodo> Choese it
[4:30:17] <+JFrostyBeats> doing his s-link he becomes a lot better

[4:30:30] <alphonseisbest> @Klefth very easily mate

[4:33:45] <dead_harmony13> I hate Kamoshida more than any other baddie in this game
[4:33:46] <valentinostand> for real?!
[4:33:47] <%weissguard> Global Saturation INCOMING.
[4:33:51] <+SpicyCheeseNips> Man, the Japanese school system is fucked.
[4:33:56] <%RubberFistFight> @mankeyfigh god it was fucking terrible wasn't it.
[4:33:59] <Thirtine> is PERSONAL
[4:34:01] <+lazygertt> best villain
[4:34:02] <JoveGar> its all down hill from here
[4:34:02] <+ElEversoris> he is the biggest shit head
[4:34:02] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> 3rd one is a shithead. The bad end is dark
[4:34:04] <TheShockVox> @keyd00d oh, that‚Äôs fine though
[4:34:05] <+lazygertt> front load games
[4:34:05] <neVan0> kamoshida's the worst
[4:34:06] <%Keyd00d> I feel like a lot of the other bad guys aren't even close to this amount of scumbag
[4:34:06] <aeonicvector> Kamoshida is the perfect "NO FUCK ADULTS" intro
[4:34:08] <Joestar1890> Kamoshida is a FUCKING ASSHOLE
[4:34:08] <b_ikki> it's also the only one you're involved with
[4:34:09] <%Dragon_Batman> Yea this first bit is heavy as fuck
[4:34:10] <%republicofu> I feel like Komoshida is a little too strong of a start to be honest
[4:34:12] <SilverJakler> @RubberFistFight I also really liked Tae's previous VA though
[4:34:13] <%MonsterEnvy> There is some real shit headed people in the world
[4:34:13] <%spiritofmojave> Most the villains aren't rapists, sorta. or atleast to this degree
[4:34:14] <Aydarkzero> he cucks Ryuji Kappa
[4:34:14] <+brightman42> stop being a dumb bitch, Ryuji
[4:34:16] <%Dragon_Batman> even heavier as it goes on
[4:34:18] <alphonseisbest> and then the game falls flat on its face soon after
[4:34:18] <%nofestu2> RUN YOU IDIOT
[4:34:19] <ammobasket> that's rich considering the injury
[4:34:20] <+PR0swagonist> Kamoshida is the most "real" feeling threat
[4:34:21] <+Pookiedaexzile> YOU CAN DO IT BAKUGO
[4:34:21] <zentav> Art thief watched a woman die in front of him

[4:58:10] <+fallenlogan> Pat's gonna step outside tomorrow, that's why it's a big day tomorrow
[4:58:10] <%ZephynM> I ended up preordering RE3 so I'm excited to play it when it comes on Steam.
[4:58:13] <%FalseEyeD> @SyLuX45 Because we touch ourselves at night
[4:58:15] <TheZearGuy> Wonder if he‚Äôs been playing more Nioh 2
[4:58:16] <zenith0111> @sylux45 Because Japan knows how to sell products
[4:58:17] <+Sir_Dolphinian> @SyLuX45 GIVE US MONEY THAT'S WHY
[4:58:36] <%spiritofmojave> I hope Square sends an email when NA gets our Amazon shit out
[4:58:40] <WanderingSwordsman> I'm still surprised he streamed this
[4:58:45] <zenith0111> Is Royal dlc or like a Final Mix?
[4:58:48] <%Dragon_Batman> Man Nioh 2 is a nice step up on 1
[4:58:55] <+Sir_Dolphinian> @SyLuX45 the real question is why is zelda breath of the wild mother fucking 60
[4:58:56] <TheShockVox> Playing the game right now. Kamoshida is such an embarrassing joke. HEY LOOK AT ME SHOW OFF BY STYLING ON THIS KIDS IN VOLLEYBALL
[4:58:57] <%ZephynM> @zenith0111 It is its own game DL
[4:58:58] <WanderingSwordsman> @zenith0111 final mix
[4:59:05] <%Nobrev> @zenith0111 final mix
[4:59:07] <%ZephynM> @zenith0111 Or physical copy, whatever you go for.
[4:59:12] <CaptainKarite> @zenith0111 final mix times 10
[4:59:16] <%ZephynM> Point is, P5R is standalone.
[4:59:18] <%mechslayer71> @theshockvox It gets worse
[4:59:53] <%ZephynM> Looks like a improved revised version of P5, so the guy at gamestop was right when he told me I should've waited.
[5:00:00] <zenith0111> As long as it's not full price then I'm on board
[5:00:02] <WanderingSwordsman> At least with Kamoshida you really want to kick his ass
[5:00:05] <%ZephynM> But I only paid $30 for the original so meh
[5:00:11] <%Dragon_Batman> There is some new stuff in P5R too
[5:00:13] <TheShockVox> @mechslayer71 Oh I‚Äôve beat vanilla. I just forgot how pathetic it looks. Like it‚Äôs framed like LOOK HOW COOL HE IS but it‚Äôs like being hype about a gym teach juking on kids in basketball.
[5:00:16] <%ZephynM> I just checked, P5R is $60
[5:00:28] <%Nobrev> Its rebalanced with some new features and content
[5:00:29] <zenith0111> NotLikeThis I'll wait
[5:00:35] <WanderingSwordsman> would recommend a price drop
[5:00:47] <%ZephynM> New music, new interactions, balance changes. As I said, it is a revised version of the original. Plus it looks nicer.
[5:00:49] <%Dragon_Batman> I like the new character portraits
[5:00:49] <%mechslayer71> @theshockvox Well, that‚Äôs how he feels. Everyone looking on sees how fucked it is
[5:00:50] <TheShockVox> Wow he‚Äôs so talented, as he styles on these 15-16 year olds
[5:00:55] <Interestedsc00t> cool i get to pay 90 australian dollars for the same game with an extra dungeon ResidentSleeper
[5:01:00] <WanderingSwordsman> *recommend a wait until the price drop
[5:01:02] <zenith0111> @interestedsc00t Gross
[5:01:04] <%Andrizzleton> how is it not a most $20 if you own the original?
[5:01:15] <%ZephynM> They wants money.
[5:01:15] <zenith0111> @andrizzleton Guilty Gear did that
[5:01:28] <TheShockVox> I‚Äôm SO LOOKING FORWARD TO TAKING HIM DOWN AGAIN.
[5:01:39] <TheZearGuy> Spent a lot of time with vanilla p5. The minor changes I‚Äôve seen so far are very jarring
[5:01:42] <WanderingSwordsman> you get like a few items if you played the og
[5:01:45] <%Andrizzleton> I'll never play P5 again or P5R ever
[5:01:49] <%RubberFistFight> @Andrizzleton this is an established formula for Persona. P4 had P4G, P3 had FES and Portable.
[5:01:53] <%A_DEAD_SHOW> The music being pitch shifted fucks me up so much
[5:01:54] <zenith0111> You could upgrade Rev to Rev 2 for $20 if you had Rev 1
[5:01:57] <+soullesskin> Why
[5:01:57] <+darudeampersandstorm> ay
[5:02:13] <%Valdorick> And NEVER touch Youtube

[5:02:56] <+Sir_Dolphinian> sounds like a full ass schedule
[5:02:57] <%Andrizzleton> @RubberFistFight I understand however P4G was on a different platform
[5:02:57] <+chaumiester> Could you unload the entire stream.... on Pornhub?
[5:02:58] <chronoxgp> Persona 5 Royal tommarow at midnight
[5:03:01] <%ZephynM> RE3 is said (on PS store) to release 12am April 3rd EST. Which means if you are in PST, like me, that should be tomorrow at 9pm PST
[5:03:01] <+Etherealizer> You gonna do Trials of Mana this month?
[5:03:02] <KingyoNingyo> BURN YOUR DREAD
[5:03:03] <Neo_Kaiser> Near future? I'm playing FF7 right now

[5:03:05] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Last of Crunch
[5:03:07] <%Dragon_Batman> @C__Lab You should check out the beggining of the stream, where he starts the game
[5:03:07] <$Tredecian> should legit put it on pronhub given the number of pregnancies
[5:03:08] <%LaughingCatt> seems like a set list
[5:03:08] <+darudeampersandstorm> what about MW2 remastered Kappa
[5:03:09] <bruno_silv0> our stolen LP has been given back by the gods
[5:03:10] <%ÏΩîÏΩîÍæ∏Îùº> @PatStaresAt Sakura Wars pretty please?
[5:03:14] <+Etherealizer> I believe Trials of Mana comes out near end of this month IIRC
[5:03:17] <TheShockVox> Isn‚Äôt FF7 in like two weeks?
[5:03:17] <%goose_attack_almanac> Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm

[5:03:21] <%Keyd00d> Mechs and romance
[5:03:22] <%RubberFistFight> @Andrizzleton sure, but it's not like this is a new thing for Atlus.
[5:03:22] <%jiin6> D:

[5:03:32] <%genowyn> waifus even
[5:03:36] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt I never beat P5 and now it looks like I may have wasted my money with P5R LUL
[5:03:37] <+Sir_Dolphinian> @TheShockVox think it comes out on the 10th
[5:03:37] <Buka_Zero> and then cyberpunk forever
[5:03:38] <%rumtumtugnutz> @Neo_Kaiser Yeah, but it can't be streamed until the official street date because Twitch.
[5:03:41] <Aydarkzero> it's a long game
[5:03:44] <%Dragon_Batman> SeemsGood
[5:03:44] <%notjustnostalgia> thank you for playing my favorite game Pat!
[5:03:48] <olaksi> Curse your generosity
[5:03:52] <%jiin6> NO you GAME NOW
[5:03:55] <%RubberFistFight> @ScreamLord why wasted?
[5:04:04] <TheShockVox> @sir_dolphinian Oh thank god. When he said near future I got all scared. That‚Äôs my vacation
[5:04:12] <chronoxgp> Cyberpunk with A.I. Generated missions and levels
[5:04:14] <Aydarkzero> neat
[5:04:19] <Grennold> On the plus side, Persona 5 is so long that by the time you finish it the lockdowns will be over 4Head
[5:04:31] <%SoFarFetched> No pat
[5:04:31] <mostundesired> I wasn't here, nerd.
[5:04:32] <ScreamLord> @RubberFistFight Because P5R seems to be the superior version
[5:04:34] <BoneSkore> got heem
[5:04:36] <%CokeMilkRequiem> y-you didnt get me
[5:04:38] <Aydarkzero> i wasn't i just wanted to watch you stream
[5:04:38] <%CokeMilkRequiem> baka
[5:04:38] <%TheDullaMAN> I wasn't fooled. I had a feelin'
[5:04:40] <$KnivesEve> wait so no archive this due to atlas being stupid? damn

[5:05:05] <%optimasmaximas> vod stays
[5:05:13] <ScreamLord> @RubberFistFight I meant I wasted my money on the OG version since I never finished it and now P5R is out
[5:05:17] <%A_DEAD_SHOW> OH nice
[5:05:18] <arkv01> delete it after 30 days just in case, archive it on ***
[5:05:19] <%RubberFistFight> @ScreamLord it's the "wasted" part I don't understand, but maybe I'm reading it wrong. Are you saying you bought P5 and it's a waste because of P5R?
[5:05:21] <%RubberFistFight> oh ok yeah
[5:05:32] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @schlager087 Imma play a mystery game. Starts P5, nah jk. Starts P5R, nah jk again, gotta pee. Ok, lets start P5R now
[5:05:34] <$KnivesEve> oh okay i missed the initial explain, now i know
