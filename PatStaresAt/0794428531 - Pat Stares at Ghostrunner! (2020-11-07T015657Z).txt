[0:10:36] <+Roundelay11> You won't be able to find one in person either
[0:10:39] <%AgniBrandt> If it makes you feel any better I had a similar issue with the Cyberpunk 2077 collector's edition with Best Buy. Except they just were never gonna get me one.
[0:10:41] <%fat_burtreynolds> American one too
[0:10:41] <phantomsleeves> that‚Äôs why you always get two
[0:10:43] <%Kaask> its fine, it has no games for now anyways
[0:10:43] <%SirKeigan> I work at Target and didn't pre-order originally and we have no idea what to do other than just try to buy it online the day they go up. Good fucking luck
[0:10:48] <%cvp5127> but money
[0:10:50] <+Draco_Aeris> but the money pat
[0:10:50] <%cobalt_phoenix_> now i dont feel dumb for not preordering one
[0:10:51] <+Roundelay11> Best Buy has said they won't bother selling any in person till Jan
[0:10:52] <%Trillex56> how many billions in medical research did it take to make her slightly less busted LUL glad shes back tho
[0:10:52] <%greasypete00> but the money
[0:10:52] <%TheLemuroid> Didn't you order like 3 of them?
[0:10:55] <Animorphimagi> yuuuuup

[0:11:07] <+vaderxyz1970> But the stockholders Pat
[0:11:08] <Kemmybelle> and that's why you get multiple pre-orders.
[0:11:11] <%fat_burtreynolds> Tell that to Sony
[0:11:12] <%Frost_Quill> I might just wait until the PS5 Pro they're almost assuredly going to release. My PC is decent enough to play most games I want to play.

[0:11:47] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt I'm waiting to see how busted the PS5 will be so they can fix those issues before I get one, so them being out of stock just makes the wait easier

[0:17:34] <%SirKeigan> Taking bets on when the US election will be over. Two days? Three? A week?
[0:17:45] <%SirKeigan> You can't pre-order anymore
[0:17:52] <%cobalt_phoenix_> my guess is next week
[0:18:00] <yourliteraldog> Isn't Vallorant Overwatch flavored spy ware
[0:18:04] <SilverFaustX> election over when ps5 is in stock
[0:18:05] <heart_ablaze> I want it to last as long as possible
[0:18:08] <%Trillex56> hopefully next week
[0:18:14] <+a_c_chirns> @Dakuu75 just wait until they start making them more consistently
[0:18:26] <%Dakuu75> oh-ok, gotchya~
[0:18:32] <%cobalt_phoenix_> valorant is overwatch flavored csgo but with a spyware aftertaste
[0:18:34] <heart_ablaze> some find the election stressful, I find it hilarious
[0:18:49] <+IrishWeegee> I thought they reeled back the spyware on valorant
[0:19:10] <%wibbwobbler> trump stressesthe fuck out of me
[0:19:13] <yourliteraldog> I'm waiting to see if the first wave of PS5s ship with any issues.
[0:19:18] <+a_c_chirns> @IrishWeegee you can turn it off now, but it still requires kernel access during play
[0:19:23] <%cobalt_phoenix_> honestly only reason i would buy a ps5 somewhat early is if we get bloodborne in 60 fps
[0:19:25] <+TaylOctopus91> !uptime
[0:19:25] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 19m 34s.
[0:19:31] <%cobalt_phoenix_> or bloodborne 2

[0:20:29] <+a_c_chirns> smooth 25 FPS like Diablo 2
[0:20:34] <TheZearGuy> So confirmed it‚Äôs the worst From game ever then?
[0:20:41] <heart_ablaze> Goddammit i want bloodborne on 60 fps so bad but I know thats basically impossible
[0:20:48] <%derrickslays> Am I wrong that I gave in and bought an eBay preorder of the ps5
[0:21:00] <SilverFaustX> a hacked ps4 has bb on 60fps
[0:21:22] <%DarthPlaugas> Has Bloodborne been...acquired on pc yet?
[0:21:29] <+TaylOctopus91> Maybe after Demon Souls, Bluepoint can remake Bloodborne at 60fps.
[0:21:30] <heart_ablaze> demon souls has spoiled me
[0:21:30] <%DarthPlaugas> YO
[0:21:30] <%Higure_yoru> doesnt run very well though
[0:21:32] <yourliteraldog> I'm alittle upset they gave demon souls a good character creator. I like how from soft characters look like ass.

[0:21:43] <%DarthPlaugas> Oh
[0:21:50] <+TaylOctopus91> That, or have Bloodborne 2 be 60fps by default
[0:22:20] <+a_c_chirns> whens Bloodborne Kart
[0:22:25] <%derrickslays> I bought an eBay preorder of the ps5, am I dumb I hope not
[0:22:30] <yourliteraldog> What if Bloodborne 2 is Elden Ring
[0:22:51] <+IrishWeegee> @derrickslays how much did you pay over MSRP?

[0:57:08] <LethalPlacebo> am ghost leggo
[0:57:09] <Dr_Angelic> Is this game playable on controller? I tried the demo with one and was almost put off by the fact it was clearly meant for M&K but 'cause of some wrist issues it's kind of a requirement.
[0:57:09] <dots4eyes> This track
[0:57:12] <+twohitgood> this is from the shadow warrior devs, right?
[0:57:13] <DavidSanChan> you no mess with lo wang

[0:57:21] <%kamig92> @patstaresat, you should watch the intro before playing the first level
[0:57:24] <+thegreenbenis> This fucing music
[0:57:25] <%BoxNavy> D:
[0:57:26] <Dr_Angelic> *completeable and actually fun on controller
[0:57:27] <jorniev> looks like fps katana zero
[0:57:27] <devanmuse> Synthwave is always good for a soundtrack. Is Carpenter Brut in this game OST?
[0:57:27] <%greasypete00> i played the demo of this game and it firmly cemented itself as a must buy, its real fun
[0:57:27] <%Dakuu75> oooh, is this Samurai Mirror's Edge???
[0:57:30] <%twistedj3ster> this is reminding me of how I had to wipe my windows installation
[0:57:34] <+HitchhikingThrough> So does this play as clean as it looks?
[0:57:36] <%kamig92> yeah the soundtrack is fantastic
[0:57:38] <yourliteraldog> Hotline Edge
[0:57:39] <%Fooguwu> FPS bad?
[0:57:43] <Blank9> mirrors edge but also you're genji

[0:57:48] <$RealThiele> oh no! disc room.
[0:57:52] <%AncelDeLambert> the dash is too short, I hate how hard it can make level traversal
[0:57:54] <%linSP> this is a very woolie game
[0:57:58] <Mr_Strut> future ninjas!
[0:58:01] <%BubbaRands> Is this dude lotus?
[0:58:02] <marvel877> Is this just Mirror's Edge with cyborg ninja?
[0:58:05] <LethalPlacebo> @Dr_Angelic The game is certainly playable on controller, but it does feel slower. I'm used to M & KB though
[0:58:06] <%heartlesshealer> old warframe when running instead of hops?
[0:58:06] <%kamig92> Ubisoft also got hit by ransomware. The hackers are releasing the source code for Watch Dogs: Legion
[0:58:06] <%Anime_Flux> wait a minute, this voice actor...
[0:58:08] <soos1001> Thats straightup system shock 2 music

[1:03:29] <+sinistersally> The higher the voice the less he got it
[1:03:36] <+Roundelay11> Blind dashing is not a good idea in this game

[1:03:40] <Broken_Sonex> Okay, so far that's gotta be......17 deaths?
[1:03:40] <gustavozxd> gamer at risk!
[1:03:40] <Grandma_Amari> I feel like this would be a lot easier to handle with a mouse and keyboard, but I get controller being comfy.
[1:03:41] <%BoxNavy> oh shit
[1:03:42] <LethalPlacebo> @goatbait yeah.
[1:03:42] <%goatbait> load up the Pat death count for this stream

[1:03:55] <%Monkeyweed21> 4 buttons SO HARD
[1:03:56] <Saltmeisterr> u know what has little buttons?
[1:03:56] <%BoxNavy> theres at least 4 buttons
[1:03:57] <+l3sovikk> wait until you get powers

[1:04:06] <%OrangeMDT> this seems really difficult on a controller
[1:04:06] <+CarrowayFashonti> Not gonna lie, once he understands what he is doing, this is going to look awesome

[1:04:33] <%Anime_Flux> Take Your Time
[1:04:33] <%the22cstomp> no, speed up
[1:04:34] <%AncelDeLambert> nope. It actually helps to slow down and LOOK
[1:04:34] <huskarl_zap> also just you wait

[1:04:35] <%king_wragles> You're inputs are off half a second

[1:04:44] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> Ghost Runner
[1:04:46] <LethalPlacebo> Actually there are quite a few times where you MUST slow down in this game or you'll die
[1:04:46] <%Ranryu692> try going the other direction
[1:04:54] <KaiserMario> 8 frames of lag
[1:04:54] <Broken_Sonex> SLOW DOWN. KNOW YOUR ROLE

[1:05:06] <akitanito> Oh this part sucked
[1:05:08] <+sinistersally> 4 buttons are too many for Pat, thats why he place Virtua Fighter
[1:05:10] <%goatbait> When I first played this there was a horrible 1 second input delay with the mouse
[1:05:16] <whiterump> SUPER. DISC ROOM.
[1:05:18] <Sunstalker> Oh shit, robotic arm, grapple hook. WOOLIE BAIT monkaS
[1:05:22] <TheZearGuy> Nothing waste time like trying to save time
[1:05:24] <$RealThiele> oh no
[1:05:25] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat isn't getting shot when he vaults a ledge and that's making me salty because I ALWAYS get shot vaulting the ledge
[1:05:26] <%Anime_Flux> LUL
[1:05:27] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt you gotta strafe pat. so dig sideways stupid
[1:05:30] <zashzila> I want to get this.
[1:05:30] <%BoxNavy> wait a second...
[1:05:34] <akitanito> Can't deflect to kill yet
[1:05:36] <spawnzie> Can't reflect yet @PatStaresAt
[1:05:39] <%The_Protagonist> psaWhat
[1:05:41] <AFlyingTaco1> You know, at least the respawns are fucking instantaneous. Not enough games do that.
[1:05:47] <%myfaceisapotato> If this guy is ghostrunner and has a blade do blade runners secretly have ghosts?
[1:05:52] <%goatbait> blocking is still good though
[1:05:53] <+foomaster22> @AncelDeLambert well
[1:05:54] <Man_in_the_Red> great now he's going to parry every enemies like Dark Souls
[1:06:01] <%BoxNavy> fuck you
[1:06:03] <$RealThiele> the shape of this room
[1:06:04] <Louie_Salmon> Hold on, now just wait a second
[1:06:05] <%GalacticaPhanto> yo this synthwave is really spicy good
[1:06:07] <%Anime_Flux> rude
[1:06:26] <LethalPlacebo> @goatbait they fixed that
[1:06:31] <+thegreenbenis> This music is fucking baller.
[1:06:32] <Saltmeisterr> The music reminds a bit of Punch Planet
[1:06:36] <%warlockwithapixie> oh no
[1:06:43] <%1matheuw> we spiderman bois?
[1:06:44] <%king_wragles> If the game loop wasn't so smooth, this would be an awful game
[1:06:48] <Sunstalker> Speedrunners don't use slowdown, I suppose? D:
[1:06:50] <LunarRemix> It's like Hotline Miami all over again
[1:06:54] <%king_wragles> But because it is the SMOOTHEST, this game is really solid
[1:07:03] <Broken_Sonex> Take a shot for every "Hold on." and "Wait a second." Pat says
[1:07:03] <%BoxNavy> no
[1:07:03] <%Anime_Flux> god, imagine if there was a load screen after each death
[1:07:07] <+TrebassTV> STUNTMAN IGNITION
[1:07:07] <%AncelDeLambert> good, I was getting worried for a second that Pat was WAY better at this then me.

[1:07:33] <%king_wragles> F.E.A.R. oh... stuntman is cool too I guess

[1:07:37] <+griffball13> breach the gap
[1:07:38] <Grandma_Amari> Was it for PS2?

[1:07:40] <huskarl_zap> Stuntman 1 was cool
[1:07:40] <yourliteraldog> Yee
[1:07:43] <%Dakuu75> is that the game with the bitch-hard tutorial int he garage?
[1:07:52] <+foomaster22> I could not beat it as a child
[1:07:54] <%goatbait> @LethalPlacebo I had to do some weird stuff in Properties, but I'm glad they fixed it
[1:08:01] <+sinistersally> Pat, you're zooming instead of zooping
[1:08:03] <%Bishop_Shidux> nice
[1:08:08] <LethalPlacebo> Occasionally you're character in this game just doesn't wallrun when it feels like he should. Also won't pull himself up despite the animation playing out
[1:08:11] <%wibbwobbler> fucc VoteYea
[1:08:11] <%AncelDeLambert> here we go, plot time
[1:08:13] <+thegreenbenis> Fuck this is amazing

[1:08:44] <Grandma_Amari> Yeah why would he have the faceprint for it?
[1:08:44] <%AncelDeLambert> I'm glad to watch Pat play this, because now I can actually listen to the plot. Every inch of talking while I was running around was IMPOSSIBLE to pay attention to

[1:10:59] <soos1001> yo look at all these phukin polygons
[1:10:59] <%Ranryu692> he's describing the opening cinematic
[1:11:04] <+joseph_krinsky> DISC ROOM
[1:11:07] <watts121> Pat keeps moving like he has a double jump.
[1:11:10] <%myfaceisapotato> game go 'transhumanism' and pat goes quiet to listen
[1:11:16] <Louie_Salmon> A million seems like not that many, honestly
[1:11:25] <Byr0nX> greeed
[1:11:25] <yourliteraldog> Ghost in the shell
[1:11:27] <%AncelDeLambert> I WISH this had a double jump
[1:11:33] <KaiserMario> Where's Buda when you need him...
[1:11:33] <%Ranryu692> lol
[1:11:33] <+MayorRev> man, Cyberpunk is gonna come out after all this time and be a 7/10 at best, change my goddamn mind
[1:11:33] <spawnzie> @Louie_Salmon shit happens
[1:11:37] <%1matheuw> woman bad got it
[1:11:39] <%AncelDeLambert> this has transhumanism? I couldn't hear over the glowing walls
[1:11:41] <Tachyon_Cur> Glad to see someone streaming this, fun af
[1:11:41] <+sinistersally> Got kicked out of Dharma Tower into the Greg Dumpster
[1:11:43] <%Fooguwu> pat want orb body
[1:11:43] <%bluescreen1988> psaLiz
[1:11:46] <%Monkeyweed21> that movie sucked as
[1:11:47] <%tonfirean> And now Hordak is threatening Eternia
[1:11:48] <yourliteraldog> Women
[1:11:50] <Grandma_Amari> This sounds like it's gonna have a twist of Mara being the good guy
[1:11:53] <huskarl_zap> Ghost riders arent brains transformed into toilets
[1:11:59] <%sleepers1mulant> ...INCOMPATIBLE
[1:11:59] <huskarl_zap> are not arent
[1:12:04] <%Anime_Flux> There's no time
[1:12:10] <Sunstalker> What if a lady with a tiny hat talked to you about transhumanisme? FeelsGoodMan
[1:12:11] <Parapattern> That's convenient
[1:12:17] <%Agami23> its explaining the trailer i think
[1:12:19] <+echobee_tv> Exactly the feeling I got on my first run
[1:12:19] <+Delenay> and how much is true
[1:12:20] <%Fooguwu> there's no time
[1:12:22] <%BinaryFireball> codec call
[1:12:22] <nepwar> gotta plot fast
[1:12:23] <%NoHoldsBarredProductions> psaBig plotpoints
[1:12:24] <%the22cstomp> when else are you gonna plot during high octane action?
[1:12:26] <LunarRemix> I feel like that's kind of the point, you're as lost as the character
[1:12:26] <+echobee_tv> It distracts more than anything
[1:12:27] <akitanito> Shame they didn't really need it
[1:12:28] <%Laecerelius> Sounds like it could also be big lies
[1:12:29] <heart_ablaze> plot dump
[1:12:30] <Pomer> calling it now, this dude is 100% the villian

[1:17:15] <watts121> Never punished.
[1:17:15] <+Bail_seven> only if this was 3rd person
[1:17:16] <Yung_FckUp> be a freak and use a controller and mouse

[1:28:47] <Saltmeisterr> i feel like if they are going to introduce a new mechanic they should put a checkpoint before it
[1:28:50] <%myfaceisapotato> Wow I can't believe these game devs made Raiden into a real thing
[1:28:50] <LethalPlacebo> @watts121 nop
[1:29:00] <akitanito> Don't hit red
[1:29:02] <%the22cstomp> this isnt a new mechanic
[1:29:04] <T_Sasquatch> @Saltmeisterr shhh
[1:29:04] <Grandma_Amari> All I hope for Cyberpunk is decent movement and a sword.
[1:29:15] <%BoxNavy> i cant even remember. was cyberpunk supposed to have cool movement like wallrunning and big jumps and shit?
[1:29:15] <$RealThiele> let the lasers touch your eyes

[1:29:48] <Hillthugsta> @grandma_amari just play revengence in that case LUL
[1:29:50] <KenzBurp> all i hope for cyberpunk is no crunch and no transphobia...oh wait
[1:29:51] <Saltmeisterr> don't shhh me DansGame
[1:29:51] <watts121> These seriously remind me of Portal 2 levels.
[1:29:53] <Tachyon_Cur> @boxnavy if I remember right, yeah. I‚Äôm curious as to how they‚Äôve made the melee combat, hope it‚Äôs as dynamic as they want
[1:29:55] <%The_Protagonist> psaDogchamp
[1:30:00] <LethalPlacebo> This game has 3 types of collectibles: sword skins, lore items, and audio logs. The second 2 are so boring that they're basically trash
[1:30:03] <agustorm123> Cyberpunk is GTA and shitty Witcher fighting
[1:30:08] <%twistedj3ster> this level design is making me miserable
[1:30:09] <Rionxgarland> i know this is a jumpy slicey game but how the fuck does anyone other than the main character get around
[1:30:12] <watts121> Man these guys got super aim.
[1:30:18] <%myfaceisapotato> Cyberpunk is the first non-strand based game and that's all we know
[1:30:22] <LethalPlacebo> @agustorm123 Seems more like a bigger Deus Ex: Mankind Divided
[1:30:24] <%Fooguwu> @KenzBurp as a trans person cyberpunk isnt transphobic people are just dumb about it
[1:30:25] <Grandma_Amari> These guys watched Surviving Edged Weapons
[1:30:30] <heart_ablaze> this is gonna be a dumb question, but what type of game is cyberpunk anyway?
[1:30:35] <$RealThiele> this is also woolie bait cause travel by normies done by jetpack
[1:30:38] <Byr0nX> yea this a no
[1:30:39] <watts121> Don't you mean stop "ghost running"?
[1:30:46] <%BoxNavy> its an fps rpg
[1:30:46] <T_Sasquatch> Do it perfect or die is a real hit or miss genre
[1:30:51] <Sunstalker> heart_ablaze An rpg.
[1:30:51] <LethalPlacebo> @heart_ablaze Immersive Sim type, like the Deus Ex games
[1:30:53] <akitanito> Use that radar
[1:30:53] <yourliteraldog> They better put netrunner the card game in cyberpunk. Netrunner was a good game
[1:30:54] <%Rusty_beartrap> Portal and Mirror Edge got drunk at a hipster EDM concert and made a baby.

[1:31:16] <KenzBurp> @Fooguwu Oh. I wasn't aware you spoke for all of us. Forgive me.
[1:31:17] <%MechArch> they should've spelled the name arkiteckt like doktor
[1:31:17] <hotterk88> man you really gotta be in your toes
[1:31:18] <Tachyon_Cur> I‚Äôll just say, I‚Äôm really excited for Cyberpunk. Hope it gets near the hype, at least.
[1:31:21] <$heyitskev_> Dr. Light's Upgrade Pod!
[1:31:24] <%StaceMcGate> @PatStaresAt would you accept being an assassin if it meant robot body?
[1:31:24] <%MechArch> except doktor is cool
[1:31:30] <watts121> I notice that for some reason the mobs aim hack stops working when you wall run.
[1:31:31] <%tonfirean> disc void
[1:31:32] <agustorm123> is going to be boring to play like Witcher but with great story I already feel it
[1:31:32] <paddingtontv> reminds me of clustertruck, superhot, and that one level in titanfall 2
[1:31:36] <%BoxNavy> these parts are kinda lame yeah. where is the ghost running?
[1:31:37] <%Fooguwu> @KenzBurp i forgive you

[1:32:54] <%Piemen99> hit it twice?
[1:32:55] <Grandma_Amari> I think you have to activate them so that they stick
[1:32:57] <$RealThiele> but
[1:32:58] <Grandma_Amari> And dont move

[1:34:46] <%wruce__billis> YOU HAD IT
[1:34:46] <%Agami23> i think you click the trigger to target htem or something
[1:34:46] <%Monkeyweed21> PAT
[1:34:47] <LethalPlacebo> This one actually is a little finnicky
[1:34:48] <%josstyl_0> this is painful;
[1:34:49] <T_Sasquatch> can pat not see red
[1:34:50] <akitanito> D-d-disc room

[1:34:58] <%radregice> PAT
[1:35:04] <%radregice> LUL
[1:35:04] <%Dakuu75> "You are free to eat."
[1:35:06] <Sunstalker> aim between them
[1:35:07] <LethalPlacebo> @Agami23 it auto-targets
[1:35:07] <%logoth_> this happened to me too
[1:35:07] <%walternatorz> notice the red box surrounding each one
[1:35:08] <dj_arashi_rora> oh no
[1:35:08] <%Monkeyweed21> DSPat
[1:35:09] <+VoxelFox51> jesus pat
[1:35:09] <jorniev> THINK HIT BOXES PAT
[1:35:10] <+Tesselcraig> the attack has some width to it and snaps to the furthest enemy.
[1:35:10] <%AncelDeLambert> not often
[1:35:11] <+HitchhikingThrough> Good point
[1:35:11] <T_Sasquatch> oh boy
[1:35:12] <+KTDelgado> do it while wall ridinf
[1:35:12] <%wruce__billis> ALL THE FUCKING TIME
[1:35:13] <+the22cstomp> oh no
[1:35:13] <Man_in_the_Red> its streak not stinger
[1:35:13] <hotterk88> AGAIN!
[1:35:14] <akitanito> Never
[1:35:15] <tanarath> now
[1:35:18] <%BoxNavy> no
[1:35:19] <%myfaceisapotato> speedruns LUL
[1:35:20] <@SSaryn> Spoilers, not for 3 enemies. Ever.
[1:35:21] <$RealThiele> controller problems
[1:35:21] <%king_wragles> It's a line you move in and hit all enemies in the path
[1:35:22] <%AncelDeLambert> seriously, game, eat my dick
[1:35:23] <%1matheuw> AGAINE
[1:35:24] <LunarRemix> It's a dash that kill everything in the way, it's super useful
[1:35:24] <%BoxNavy> for this tutorial
[1:35:24] <+VoxelFox51> PICTURE YOUR DESTINATION
[1:35:27] <%AgniBrandt> If you build for it it's pretty good.
[1:35:34] <hotterk88> lol!
[1:35:34] <yourliteraldog> nice
[1:35:35] <+griffball13> you don't aim at a guy you aim at a palce
[1:35:42] <%the22cstomp> just do the tutorial
[1:35:43] <%AncelDeLambert> I'm SO glad that Pat's getting as aggravated as I was
[1:35:46] <%sleepers1mulant> Actually pretty cool
[1:35:49] <LethalPlacebo> Pat, it doesn't require 3 enemies to use, it's just trying to teach you
[1:35:50] <@SSaryn> It does have an extra use.
[1:35:52] <%Monkeyweed21> its easier when you actually read
[1:35:54] <Oxybe> I've seen peeps play this game. maybe not 3 enemies, but the ability to zip+kill is super useful
[1:35:54] <%BoxNavy> NotLikeThis
[1:35:55] <+trekkie11041> ITS A CONE NOT A TARGET
[1:35:56] <T_Sasquatch> NotLikeThis
[1:35:57] <Broken_Sonex> You not gonna do it this way, anyway! LUL
[1:35:57] <unas2e> NotLikeThis
[1:35:58] <%myfaceisapotato> NotLikeThis
[1:35:59] <%Valdorick> Its a short dash, not a teleport
[1:35:59] <%the22cstomp> now do you see why it's useful?
[1:36:02] <%AncelDeLambert> so yeah, this is supposed to be the auto-fire counter
[1:36:02] <%Fooguwu> not like this NotLikeThis
[1:36:05] <Yung_FckUp> the speedrunner im watching in the background already beat the game
[1:36:06] <narusao> FailFish
[1:36:08] <masterfire23> NotLikeThis
[1:36:08] <%BoxNavy> no
[1:36:09] <%BinaryFireball> AI dad is disappoint
[1:36:14] <+ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Pat's weakness is the written word
[1:36:15] <+PaiRho> the hell is there to understand about "Cut bullet"
[1:36:16] <scarman125> you're so good at this Pat. i'm in awe of your skill
[1:36:16] <$0ddeye> You play video games for a living Pat
[1:36:19] <%the22cstomp> pat think of the dragon from katana zero
[1:36:19] <Saltmeisterr> u def wanna rebind that
[1:36:21] <%the22cstomp> that's the power
[1:36:24] <DraxTD> it's fine guys... we'll BRUTE FORCE IT... the pat way
[1:36:24] <+VoxelFox51> @BinaryFireball I am disapoint
[1:36:26] <Samaugsch2> @monkeyweed21 Bold of you to assume pat can read
[1:36:27] <%Anime_Flux> My-face-to-your-bullets style, how do you like it?
[1:36:29] <%Fooguwu> aim at the space pat, not the people
[1:36:30] <Grandma_Amari> It doesn't seem very convenient if it's that finnicky
[1:36:30] <T_Sasquatch> its just a genji dash
[1:36:32] <+MayorRev> HE CEASES TO BE
[1:36:32] <%Deano8817> that's just the tutorial
[1:36:34] <akitanito> You don't
[1:36:34] <%Monkeyweed21> YOURE NOT
[1:36:35] <Saltmeisterr> ITS A CONE PAT
[1:36:35] <Fear_Ranjer> That was already a puzzle, why did they need the slide puzzle beforehand?
[1:36:35] <%AncelDeLambert> rebind the power button IMMEDIATELY
[1:36:36] <$RealThiele> disc room!
[1:36:37] <LunarRemix> It's a Genji's dash Pat.
[1:36:39] <agustorm123> Dont aim at them
[1:36:39] <+trekkie11041> you dont its a cone
[1:36:42] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> Nice job, journo.
[1:36:43] <Sunstalker> You aim between them, pat. Like an X strike
[1:36:50] <jorniev> seems kinda weird
[1:36:55] <Tachyon_Cur> That tutorial wasn‚Äôt a good example, it‚Äôs actually fun to use once you get it down
[1:36:59] <%AncelDeLambert> you guys can yell "IT'S A CONE" as much as you want, it doesn't SHOW its boundaries
[1:37:04] <%myfaceisapotato> Aim it like a AOE instead of a gun
[1:37:08] <+duskrush> you must aim BEYOND
[1:37:10] <%Fooguwu> dont target them, you just do a dash
[1:37:10] <spawnzie> You got more ability room btw
[1:37:11] <%OrangeMDT> you could also just use it to attack through shots. Doesn't have to be for multi-kills
[1:37:11] <huskarl_zap> Also they're all died eyes
[1:37:13] <watts121> Oh no it's a killstreak? I thought it was on a cooldown.
[1:37:13] <%AgniBrandt> There's an upgrade that makes it much wider
[1:37:13] <LethalPlacebo> Agreed, it's finnicky as shit
[1:37:14] <%Ranryu692> @PatStaresAt you have more upgrade space now
[1:37:22] <$RealThiele> id say its closer to a PBAoE
[1:37:26] <%Laecerelius> Yeah a visual guide for the tutorial would be nice
[1:37:26] <masterfire23> stuffed tennis dash
[1:37:28] <+solphum> the atache case has increased
[1:37:29] <+ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Dash Through not To
[1:37:29] <Broken_Sonex> Yeah, it doesn't seem fun with the way they want you to do it
[1:37:34] <%sleepers1mulant> SourPls
[1:37:35] <LethalPlacebo> @watts121 It is a cooldown, but the cooldown is really long unless you kill enemies
[1:37:36] <ammobasket> Narrow-ass cone :(
[1:37:42] <akitanito> Have you ever used your double dash at all
[1:37:56] <+Sendrak70> You dont have to line them up. It was just teaching you it can hit multiple targets, slows time and ignores bullets.
[1:37:57] <%AncelDeLambert> you can slot range
[1:38:08] <%the22cstomp> you can slot a piece
[1:38:11] <%AncelDeLambert> I don't think he slotted the double
[1:38:11] <jellssssss20> That's what you equipped?
[1:38:13] <Sunstalker> range fits if you can turn it
[1:38:17] <+griffball13> it was the upgrade you picked
[1:38:19] <spawnzie> Pat pls read your upgrades
[1:38:20] <%AgniBrandt> You literally have the double dash upgrade installed RIGHT NOW
[1:38:22] <+Tesselcraig> you have double dash slotted
[1:38:24] <%1matheuw> calm down chat is just game
[1:38:26] <%arancet> you have double dash right now
[1:38:27] <%Ranryu692> Double dash is only on the ground, but you did equip it
[1:38:28] <Daxalog> What? I thought you equiped the double dash first?
[1:38:28] <akitanito> lol
[1:38:31] <LethalPlacebo> Also: the more pieces you slot the LONGER your ability cooldown is
[1:38:41] <jellssssss20> he's accidentally used it once
[1:38:41] <+VoxelFox51> @PatStaresAt I strongly recomend the one that lets you reflect bullets
[1:38:42] <+duskrush> you have it equipped. We see it on the hud
[1:38:43] <+ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Aim PAST them
[1:38:44] <%AgniBrandt> But the double dash only works on the ground, it is NOT a double air-dash
[1:38:47] <%greasypete00> gotta go, bye chat and pat
[1:38:49] <%Ranryu692> its range is short unless you put in the upgrade
[1:38:52] <%BoxNavy> stop running, ghostrunner
[1:38:53] <%AncelDeLambert> this game has one primary problem and it's name is "communication"
[1:39:02] <Broken_Sonex> "But....how...? Why did it not...?"
[1:39:21] <Yung_FckUp> if you jump on their heads they should die
[1:39:35] <+Sendrak70> Will this end up being Pat¬¥s shadow puzzle?
[1:39:38] <+Nemesisnick33> this isnt gonna be a fun game to watch is it
[1:39:39] <+griffball13> @PatStaresAt pro tip you can parry bullets with your sword swing
[1:39:40] <%myfaceisapotato> Honestly it's still useful just as a dash since the default dash is so short
[1:39:45] <%AncelDeLambert> so, yeah, this is basically DOOM Eternal DLC but without guns. HAVE FUN!
[1:39:49] <Ikazix> I'd say the game is in the vein of Hotline Miami, Furi, or Katana Zero
[1:39:50] <T_Sasquatch> they have auto aim if they see you you need to dodge LUL
[1:39:54] <akitanito> One guy left
[1:39:54] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[1:39:55] <%OrangeMDT> you have a map
[1:39:56] <%Fooguwu> the guy with the gun
[1:39:56] <$RealThiele> the sword range is deceptivelt long
[1:39:58] <Ikazix> Dying a lot is the natural course of things until you get a level down.
[1:40:06] <%mythcreant> that wasnt a tutorial that was a training arena with someone yelling at you to get gud
[1:40:22] <huskarl_zap> does that billboard say mayonaise?
[1:40:32] <%mythcreant> yes
[1:40:39] <+VoxelFox51> and less competant pats
[1:40:40] <%sleepers1mulant> Keep running or die
[1:40:41] <Tachyon_Cur> PogChamp
[1:40:43] <%AncelDeLambert> @mythcreant right?
[1:40:57] <%Ranryu692> yeah, that happens a lot
[1:41:05] <+Dova573> did this also become the raid?
[1:41:07] <+griffball13> folded over 1000 times
[1:41:10] <+Left_Justified> Yoshimitsu mains atpCap
[1:41:11] <%AncelDeLambert> huh, I wonder where the taunt is on k&m
[1:41:12] <+CarrowayFashonti> That logo reminds me a lot of Ultratech from KI
[1:41:12] <Broken_Sonex> This game doesn't seem to tell you what to do very good....
[1:41:13] <%sleepers1mulant> Why does that say mayonnaise
[1:41:18] <akitanito> look up
[1:41:21] <%Ranryu692> I did that too xD
[1:41:23] <jellssssss20> So what upgrade do you have equipped if it isn't the double dash @PatStaresAt
[1:41:30] <T_Sasquatch> web zipppp
[1:41:30] <$RealThiele> disc room
[1:41:36] <+Ketronox> this part is kinda hard
[1:41:39] <%BoxNavy> hell yeah
[1:41:47] <+Ketronox> damn guess I just sucked
[1:41:50] <+VoxelFox51> he did it in one shot! gj
[1:41:56] <$xXRealGamerThaigeXx> double dash only works on the ground im pretty sure
[1:42:01] <+VoxelFox51> @slot the deflect bullets one
[1:42:05] <Tachyon_Cur> This part fucked me up, great job vineChamp
[1:42:05] <+griffball13> you can parry bullets with your sword swing
[1:42:08] <akitanito> Rotate
[1:42:11] <%Ranryu692> X to rotate
[1:42:11] <%weissguard> This game seems kinda like it's made for the 2nd playthrough.
[1:42:13] <+VoxelFox51> @PatStaresAt the deflect bullets one is really good
[1:42:16] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat you JUST opined that you could rotate the power blocks
[1:42:17] <spawnzie> You can flip em
[1:42:18] <akitanito> Aaahhh
[1:42:18] <%Anime_Flux> rotate, my dude
[1:42:19] <+trekkie11041> hes goblin breathing
[1:42:21] <%Anime_Flux> it's tetris
[1:42:24] <Sunstalker> @PatStaresAt You can fit the old one and the most elft green block
[1:42:24] <AFlyingTaco1> Well, I was hoping to see some combat in Fextralife's AC Valhalla stream, but the guy is just running around towns gambling
[1:42:27] <LethalPlacebo> You need to be QUICK for that deflect to work
[1:42:33] <%Dakuu75> "a-gain"
[1:42:44] <%AncelDeLambert> oh... THIS room
[1:42:48] <%AncelDeLambert> FUCK this room
[1:42:51] <+vwvwvwvwvvvw> this is the last game i'd want to play with a controller lol
[1:43:01] <agustorm123> Imagine playing this game with perma death
[1:43:06] <Parapattern> There's so many
[1:43:13] <T_Sasquatch> this seems so annoying LUL
[1:43:16] <Tachyon_Cur> @weissguard pretty much imo
[1:43:17] <akitanito> 3 shields
[1:43:17] <+VoxelFox51> follow the level, its built like a racetrack
[1:43:23] <%wruce__billis> imagine playing this gabhme with a controller
[1:43:25] <%AncelDeLambert> oh, the shield ball was shielded
[1:43:33] <%mythcreant> @agustorm123 I'd set game on fire
[1:43:39] <%BoxNavy> yeah. its ghostrunner
[1:43:39] <%Ranryu692> yeah, it still needs some polish
[1:43:40] <%AncelDeLambert> Monday's gonna be fun
[1:43:41] <%sleepers1mulant> Speed runs of this game are gonna be fucking crazy
[1:43:47] <Broken_Sonex> @T_Sasquatch VERY annoying

[1:44:03] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> @Monkeyweed21 nice
[1:44:03] <%sleepers1mulant> Yeah it is pat
[1:44:11] <+Shockrates20XX> Faith Mirrors Edge didn't have a laser tether
[1:44:11] <+VoxelFox51> @Monkeyweed21 PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[1:44:11] <%Anime_Flux> Before you see, you must think...
[1:44:14] <AFlyingTaco1> If he can play DOOM Eternal with a control just fine, I think he'll be alright guys
[1:44:15] <%AncelDeLambert> @Ranryu692 dude, I played the demo, thought "boy, I sure hope they fix some of this jank" and then it came out and was MORE jank
[1:44:18] <%Anime_Flux> Before you think, you must FEEL
[1:44:23] <+TrebassTV> what if we protected our shield generators with another shield
[1:44:25] <%tonfirean> This seems like a pretty different style of traversal from Mirror's Edge anyway.
[1:44:29] <gustavozxd> maybe it's designed with mouse and keyboard in mind?
[1:44:35] <%AncelDeLambert> HE AINT WRONG
[1:44:36] <%BoxNavy> true
[1:44:38] <akitanito> It
[1:44:42] <akitanito> *It's not just you
[1:44:44] <spawnzie> I dont mind it
[1:44:44] <gustavozxd> true
[1:44:45] <%Monkeyweed21> @ scrubquotes
[1:44:46] <+VoxelFox51> @gustavozxd it is
[1:44:49] <%AncelDeLambert> wait until you meet the red shield bros, Pat
[1:44:56] <%AgniBrandt> Blink can ignore shields, notably.
[1:44:56] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> BUFF TOTEM NEARBY
[1:44:58] <%BoxNavy> soemthing like this is really wack for a fast paced touch of death game
[1:44:58] <Ikazix> It is just more difficulty, artificial or not comes down to opinion
[1:44:59] <akitanito> I dropped it after this room
[1:45:02] <+Tesselcraig> this game is 100% desgined for M+KB, though.
[1:45:03] <%dasmause> its the buff totem all over again
[1:45:07] <%AgniBrandt> But yeah it's one of the least interesting mechanics.
[1:45:08] <agustorm123> Who test it?
[1:45:11] <scarman125> yeah you don't seem to be enjoying yourself too much
[1:45:15] <%BoxNavy> youre right
[1:45:23] <Yung_FckUp> eat your platforming first
[1:45:24] <gustavozxd> kinda forces you to kill the guys in a specific order
[1:45:28] <masterfire23> this game seems much harder with a controller
[1:45:28] <scarman125> i just got here though so i never seen pre buff totem gameplay
[1:45:31] <%BoxNavy> pat boot up katana zero again
[1:45:37] <agustorm123> is anoying
[1:45:39] <KaiserMario> Remember DmC and that shild mechanic?
[1:45:43] <Gallhint> Local ninja upset he cant kill
[1:45:47] <%BoxNavy> him using a controller isnt the problem moon2W
[1:45:51] <%Monkeyweed21> combat in Mirrors edge sucked ass tho
[1:45:51] <Tachyon_Cur> Playing this with keyboard and mouse just felt wrong idk why
[1:45:51] <akitanito> Use radar
[1:45:56] <+sixcubit> if i were ORB i would simply get a shield from other ORB
[1:45:56] <%Fooguwu> radar
[1:45:59] <%AncelDeLambert> the radar is WAY too small to actually bother checking half the time
[1:46:04] <%Ranryu692> @AncelDeLambert LUL
[1:46:05] <Broken_Sonex> Well, i think Cyberpunk won't be this annoying. They'll just let you blow up dudes.
[1:46:10] <%weissguard> Also, kinda seems like games of this type live or die on how snappy the moment to moment game is. Something like finding the shield generator then killing people seems like it breaks momentum.
[1:46:12] <+VoxelFox51> he did it
[1:46:17] <Tachyon_Cur> @monkeyweed21 :( you kind of right though
[1:46:20] <gustavozxd> @BoxNavy I haven't played this so idk, just a theory
[1:46:28] <%sleepers1mulant> I was hoping this game would be better, the demo really hooked me
[1:46:36] <+Ketronox> Has he tried alternating between slide and sprint for speed boost?
[1:46:52] <akitanito> I don't think he remembers
[1:46:54] <+VoxelFox51> @sleepers1mulant it is good, pat and chat just make it seem bad
[1:47:01] <+Ketronox> *slide and jump, sorry
[1:47:05] <jokerbla12> is this genji's cousin, he can traverse walls vertically but not horizontally?
[1:47:05] <Tachyon_Cur> ^
[1:47:10] <masterfire23> honestly the skill ceiling of this game could be higher
[1:47:10] <%AncelDeLambert> Bad Lady is one of the Corpos from Outer Worlds, got it
[1:47:15] <AFlyingTaco1> Despite the Woolie bait, I don't know how well Woolie would be able to handle this level of movement.
[1:47:21] <%BoxNavy> i eam the game still is cool the shields are just kinda wack
[1:47:23] <zamzoph> Hiigara PogChamp
[1:47:30] <%Anime_Flux> well lah-dee-dah
[1:47:31] <$0ddeye> This game looks dope, I think it's just outside Pats skillset
[1:47:32] <+JenovaS> yea I enjoyed playing it through, I played on kb+m though, feels like a game that would be hard on pad
[1:47:37] <+duskrush> ergo, concordantly, vis a vis
[1:47:42] <%GalacticaPhanto> oh hes a AI Boomet
[1:47:45] <%Dakuu75> this guy sounds evil
[1:47:48] <%GalacticaPhanto> *Boomer
[1:47:49] <zamzoph> The Keymaster? The Architect? Hmmm.... ü§î
[1:47:50] <agustorm123> 63
[1:47:51] <Gorgs7> did they just straight up steal the plot of matrix 2?
[1:47:52] <%sleepers1mulant> @voxelfox51 I mean it still looks good, just janky that I wasn‚Äôt expecting
[1:47:54] <%Dylveryn> He's gonna love the first boss
[1:47:55] <yourliteraldog> Fully automated gay Luxury Communism
[1:48:00] <%BoxNavy> the results screen leaks your steam friends names btw EleGiggle
[1:48:03] <redial_nick> why all this narrative reminds me of matrix?
[1:48:06] <jellssssss20> Oh no! All those missed collectibles
[1:48:14] <akitanito> The game's more fun if you have more freedom in how you handle the enemies
[1:48:14] <%DakotaMacDoodle> They tone it down as the game goes on for the shields
[1:48:16] <Tachyon_Cur> The bosses are maddening sometimes, yeah
[1:48:19] <masterfire23> this is just making me want to play genji
[1:48:24] <Noogiez> shields are for dorks
[1:48:24] <SonicD4> are ya winning Pat?
[1:48:26] <+CapnClassix> so is this like Mirror's Edge but more stabby?
[1:48:27] <Yung_FckUp> jack off
[1:48:27] <%AncelDeLambert> I love his response to "Jack"
[1:48:30] <gustavozxd> LUL
[1:48:33] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[1:48:34] <@JustinianKnight> JACKS BACK
[1:48:35] <%Dakuu75> SAMURAI JACK?!?!?!?!?!
[1:48:38] <Lixagon> Ghost samurai jack
[1:48:38] <%AncelDeLambert> oh, I misheard
[1:48:40] <waffleandman> hes so jack
[1:48:43] <%AncelDeLambert> JACK IS A LAME NAME
[1:48:47] <jorniev> BOOOOOO
[1:48:48] <%tonfirean> I guess what I mean is, Mirror's Edge incentivizes you to learn the details of the traversal mechanics tightly. This game feels a lot more "on rails" from watching it.
[1:48:48] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> GOTTA GET BACK
[1:48:50] <Ikazix> You can wallride every other surface in the game, even the ones you're not "meant" to
[1:48:52] <waffleandman> gotta get back
[1:48:52] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> BACK TO THE PAST
[1:48:52] <T_Sasquatch> its time for JACK TO LET IT RIP
[1:48:55] <jorniev> JACKED
[1:48:56] <%BoxNavy> jack is a cool name
[1:49:01] <%NovaKnightmare> Who would name a katana wielder JACK???
[1:49:02] <ammobasket> Jack THE RIPPER
[1:49:09] <Tachyon_Cur> @t_sasquatch ty vineLUL
[1:49:19] <Nettacki> HeyGuys
[1:49:24] <Nettacki> Ghostrunner PogChamp
[1:49:25] <%sleepers1mulant> Cyberpunk cyborg with a katana named jack sounds way more cliche than it is
[1:49:31] <Broken_Sonex> I wish he said "Add "Samurai" and i
[1:49:32] <@JustinianKnight> this game seems neat
[1:49:35] <Tachyon_Cur> Remember when revengeance 2 rumors were going around :(
[1:49:36] <%Fooguwu> disc room
[1:49:38] <akitanito> Don't forget about blink
[1:49:41] <T_Sasquatch> I feel like pat is moving too fast for himself LUL
[1:49:41] <Broken_Sonex> I'll live with it
[1:49:46] <Parapattern> Slow down man
[1:49:55] <%Fooguwu> pat will never use blink
[1:49:55] <augusta_wind> cool your jets
[1:50:04] <%MidnightBurst12> NO SLOW, ONLY SPEED
[1:50:04] <+VoxelFox51> omg
[1:50:06] <%BestTeaMaker> you're dying while going fast
[1:50:08] <%ZephynM> Gotta go fast!
[1:50:11] <%the22cstomp> you're dying anyways
[1:50:11] <@JustinianKnight> gotta Jack fast
[1:50:12] <%Ranryu692> only in one section
[1:50:13] <+Draco_Renegade> Its called Ghostrunner not Ghostwalker
[1:50:13] <huskarl_zap> GAS GAS GAS
[1:50:14] <Ikazix> Pat's already on the speedrunner mindset, he already beat the game
[1:50:15] <%BoxNavy> no stand still and slowly approach the guys.
[1:50:18] <%tonfirean> Maybe it's just that Mirror's Edge tries to make you feel not-superhuman.
[1:50:21] <%LadyTheWanderer> naruto cyborg
[1:50:27] <jorniev> fast or FAST OR FASTER
[1:50:30] <jellssssss20> You may want to try to deflect bullets
[1:50:32] <%sleepers1mulant> RUN OR DIE
[1:50:33] <Noogiez> I LIKE TO GO FAST
[1:50:34] <+Tesselcraig> you HAVE to keep moving or you just fucking die. the issue is that you have to get good at the parkour or it doesn't matter how fast you go
[1:50:34] <Oxybe> Pat this isn't the movie speed. you can take a breather at times
[1:50:35] <Lixagon> gotta go just slow enough that you can still see where your going
[1:50:35] <TrollKing96> @PatStaresAt Think about how to go fast.
[1:50:36] <SonicD4> maybe change chips for this room?
[1:50:37] <+jjacksterup> D-i-S-c R-o-O-m
[1:50:40] <%wibbwobbler> try faster more ghost more running
[1:50:41] <theanora1> How are ya liking Warframe lite?
[1:50:41] <Broken_Sonex> It's not that he has to slow down, Pat just sucks LUL
[1:50:42] <augusta_wind> but what if you went FASTER
[1:50:44] <%WackyGear> @PatStaresAt you can use that power to cut through bullets
[1:50:48] <jorniev> WEIRD
[1:50:52] <%scorpio990> Genji simulator PogChamp
[1:50:54] <%Anime_Flux> Okay, so the Architect's VA's name is Mark Dodson. According to the internet, he did the voice of Salacious Crumb in Return of the Jedi... which is fucking weird...
[1:51:06] <akitanito> oh that sucks
[1:51:08] <%Monkeyweed21> even without shield johns you still fail LUL
[1:51:10] <%BoxNavy> nuh uhhh
[1:51:16] <jorniev> RAG DOLL
[1:51:18] <Saltmeisterr> wtf is a Salacious Crumb?
[1:51:19] <+duskrush> pat doesnt use the air strafe enough in combat
[1:51:32] <+VoxelFox51> this is hard to watch
[1:51:33] <+MrQuarters> you can use the air slow mo and drift pretty much every time you jump. makes dealing with the default grunts easier
[1:51:33] <@JustinianKnight> time to mash
[1:51:36] <akitanito> He could afford to use more slides too
[1:51:37] <%tonfirean> speed
[1:51:40] <%Anime_Flux> @Saltmeisterr the little muppet who sits on Jabba's shoulder
[1:51:49] <%tonfirean> (you have to hit them)
[1:51:49] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> This seems really frustrating.
[1:51:50] <augusta_wind> and i fired. and i missed. so i fired again. and i missed
[1:51:52] <%myfaceisapotato> I've never played a game where button mashing wasn't the best solution
[1:51:56] <gustavozxd> does he even know about slides?
[1:51:59] <%mythcreant> mash not important only timing important
[1:52:01] <+jjacksterup> who's gona tell him he just learn and equiped slicing through bullets
[1:52:01] <%MidnightBurst12> @saltmeisterr wierd star wars gremlin in jabba's palace
[1:52:08] <+kapcommunist> A PogChamp P PogChamp M
[1:52:12] <T_Sasquatch> One hit live games are always frustrating
[1:52:18] <T_Sasquatch> just gotta git gud
[1:52:20] <@JustinianKnight> oh no
[1:52:24] <@JustinianKnight> ATMAS
[1:52:27] <gustavozxd> metal gear?
[1:52:31] <%Monkeyweed21> Atma grinding oh no
[1:52:36] <%Jeemukun> I'm getting DDS flashbacks
[1:52:44] <TigerClaws12> LUL
[1:52:45] <agustorm123> aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand
[1:52:56] <%tonfirean> "Seeing the world from your perspective is gonna make me vom."
[1:53:04] <akitanito> He did it!
[1:53:06] <akitanito> Speed
[1:53:08] <%wibbwobbler> she got consent and errythang
[1:53:08] <TigerClaws12> slide hopping
[1:53:10] <SonicD4> speed boost and ducking for later
[1:53:14] <spawnzie> makes you go faster on slopes
[1:53:14] <T_Sasquatch> to dodge bullets .....
[1:53:15] <+Tesselcraig> you can build/maintain momentum while sliding.
[1:53:17] <%mythcreant> i can literally taste my anxiety
[1:53:18] <%MidnightBurst12> it's cool
[1:53:19] <%BoxNavy> speed. lower profile.
[1:53:22] <%Ranryu692> you can go under certain attacks
[1:53:28] <spawnzie> also ducking will be useful
[1:53:31] <Yung_FckUp> it makes you speedrun the game
[1:53:31] <Oxybe> for a moment i thought they were saying "Asthma" but with a lisp... "atma"
[1:53:32] <%tonfirean> I want her to just start being a toxic backseater.
[1:53:33] <TigerClaws12> think titanfall slide hopping but on crack
[1:53:33] <Tachyon_Cur> Good ol‚Äô Tom is gonna make him learn to slide
[1:53:39] <+duskrush> you'll need to duck in the future
[1:53:47] <jorniev> GO UNDER BULLETS?
[1:53:47] <+Tesselcraig> you can actually move faster than running by sliding to get a little speed boost, jumping out of the slide, then sliding when you hit the ground and repeating.
[1:53:54] <akitanito> Deflect tho
[1:53:57] <%BoxNavy> @tonfirean you want her to be the chat?
[1:53:59] <+VoxelFox51> @Tachyon_Cur I cant wait for him to face TOM
[1:54:06] <+geistuser> this game is hard as shit but so much fun
[1:54:07] <%tonfirean> yes
[1:54:14] <+duskrush> srafe in midair for the automatics
[1:54:21] <%OrangeMDT> repeated mistakes, suboptimal leveling, and a bunch of comments complaining about the first two things... Really takes me back to 2015
[1:54:26] <+VoxelFox51> @geistuser its hard as shit, but it is FAIR
[1:54:31] <+jjacksterup> pat is like a mobile game ad that makes you want to download the game because what you are seeing is obviously wrong
[1:54:40] <theanora1> just think about how easy this game would be if you could equip your Braton
[1:54:41] <Saltmeisterr> remember ya blink
[1:54:42] <sautong97> blink let you slice part automatic's bullets
[1:54:51] <spawnzie> if only you had an ability thar went throught projectiles
[1:54:58] <%AmanisHouseOfNonsense> So guys, on a scale of 1-BIG NUT, how hard would Woolie nut to this game so far?
[1:55:02] <T_Sasquatch> @jjacksterup thats unironically how and why i bought ds2,ds3 and bloodborne
[1:55:08] <%dasmause> im just vibing to synthwave
[1:55:09] <%wibbwobbler> one shot is linsanity ngl
[1:55:13] <jellssssss20> Will blink ever be used again?
[1:55:13] <agustorm123> Dude have good aim
[1:55:14] <%tonfirean> @jjacksterup It's Pat's next-level shilling.
[1:55:14] <%Anime_Flux> if at first you don't succeed, die, die again
[1:55:17] <+TheotherKristian> @AmanisHouseOfNonsense Nut
[1:55:17] <Ikazix> Big Nut sounds about right.
[1:55:18] <T_Sasquatch> i told myself if woolie can beat bloodborne i sure as hell can LUL
[1:55:20] <+geistuser> @VoxelFox51 oh yeah i didnt mean that it wasnt. just hate those peky shield boys
[1:55:23] <Saltmeisterr> @AmanisHouseOfNonsense CRITICAL NUT
[1:55:23] <+VoxelFox51> @AmanisHouseOfNonsense Woolie would fuckin NUT so hard hed break a window
[1:55:26] <%AncelDeLambert> @PatStaresAt hate to backseat, but the Blink power is FOR the autofire guys
[1:55:33] <%Sotetsu> Is this game spooky?
[1:55:47] <%sleepers1mulant> Sub-Vergil levels of nut
[1:55:56] <%BoxNavy> you might need it later
[1:55:57] <Noogiez> can you ping ping the bullets away with sword?
[1:55:57] <SonicD4> if you die enough you do
[1:55:57] <+VoxelFox51> Yes you do
[1:55:58] <akitanito> Dem gobliins
[1:56:05] <+l3sovikk> Deflect the bullets, Pat.
[1:56:05] <Broken_Sonex> Woolie is gonna go left instead of right alllll the fucking time in this.
[1:56:06] <+TheotherKristian> What is he needs the blink power for later..?
[1:56:07] <%AmanisHouseOfNonsense> LUL that tells me a lot about this game, mad interested in it
[1:56:17] <Ikazix> As long as it has a katana and moves fast Woolie can probably nut to it.
[1:56:18] <spawnzie> I mean to be fair I almost never use blink
[1:56:19] <+VoxelFox51> @Sotetsu not really
[1:56:21] <%tonfirean> blinking is a temporary buff
[1:56:21] <%Fooguwu> woolie can never play this
[1:56:22] <+duskrush> it's actually for killing multiple threats at once, not just the automatic guys
[1:56:37] <%Sotetsu> @voxelfox51 Dag, yo
[1:56:38] <+duskrush> but woolie WILL try
[1:56:39] <Guardiansaiyan> Hello everyone!
[1:56:39] <+jjacksterup> you can also DEFELCT bluets @PatStaresAt
[1:56:41] <SonicD4> Woolie is absolutely going to play this
[1:56:45] <Gallhint> I eagerly await to watch woolie stream this...wew
[1:56:53] <Noogiez> ooh
[1:56:56] <SonicD4> i
[1:56:59] <SonicD4> '
[1:57:04] <+duskrush> deflecting bullets is pretty difficult. Easier to use the focus to strafe around them
[1:57:06] <Yung_FckUp> üëÄ
[1:57:07] <%BoxNavy> üëÅÔ∏è üëÅÔ∏è
[1:57:12] <%AyotoCorp> @PatStaresAt Your focus meter continues building up between deaths, but if you use it up and die before a checkpoint then you keep it as if you didn't use it
[1:57:13] <+VoxelFox51> @Sotetsu Later into the game theres some augmented dudes, but its not really a spooky game
[1:57:18] <%weissguard> Wake Up Sheeple
[1:57:24] <akitanito> I find deflecting bullets easier without focus
[1:57:25] <agustorm123> Woolie is gonna die like 1 millions of times LUL
[1:57:28] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @patstaresat you can always deflect em but with the mod you can REflect them
[1:57:32] <%myfaceisapotato> Man I can't believe we're living cyberpunk for real and not even going to be able to put good on my resume :/
[1:57:37] <Broken_Sonex> Mara? The sex demon from Persona?
[1:57:43] <%myfaceisapotato> goon fuck
[1:57:51] <sithri> yeah a dick chariot is in control of this city
[1:57:54] <+VoxelFox51> you can jump these pat
[1:57:55] <akitanito> It doesn't track
[1:57:55] <%the22cstomp> you have to aim it back at them
[1:57:56] <%Ranryu692> you have to aim
[1:57:57] <%the22cstomp> it doesnt track
[1:58:00] <+Tesselcraig> you have to AIM the reflect. it doesn't automatically go back to them.
[1:58:03] <+duskrush> @PatStaresAt Also Woolie's gonna be able to see your death count and time on each level
[1:58:29] <sithri> is this first person hotline miami?
[1:58:37] <+Shockrates20XX> will Pat be eating the frustration cheese tonight?
[1:58:39] <DraxTD> oh no not WOOLIE
[1:58:39] <+VoxelFox51> @duskrush best part of the game is trying to get better time and deaths than friends
[1:58:42] <akitanito> Big greed
[1:58:48] <agustorm123> Shield Up Pat
[1:58:48] <jorniev> the teleport?
[1:58:53] <%the22cstomp> it's katana zero
[1:58:56] <enkaisu> This game seems infuriating?
[1:59:03] <Gallhint> It's hotline miami meets superhot meets katana zero
[1:59:03] <%the22cstomp> why not increase fov
[1:59:06] <%Fooguwu> with a controller and not using the radar, yes
[1:59:07] <+duskrush> @VoxelFox51 the scoreboard is built in shame
[1:59:07] <%BoxNavy> good
[1:59:13] <Broken_Sonex> Alright, who's gonna have a higher death count Woolie or Pat? I'm voting Woolie.
[1:59:18] <gustavozxd> kinda like the big ass levels in hotline miami 2 where you can't see shit sometimes
[1:59:19] <sithri> how is this like superhot?
[1:59:21] <+VoxelFox51> @PatStaresAt put the enemy highlight mod back in
[1:59:23] <%cobalt_phoenix_> pat
[1:59:27] <spawnzie> Sen's Fortress'd
[1:59:29] <%myfaceisapotato> but top down would make you FEEL like raiden
[1:59:31] <sithri> oh the first person part right
[1:59:40] <AFlyingTaco1> He
[1:59:43] <%tonfirean> I think we're just assuming that Woolie is going to be playing this.
[1:59:44] <Gallhint> sword, time stuff, deflecting, fps
[1:59:44] <%Anime_Flux> riff-raff... street rat... I don't buy that...
[1:59:48] <AFlyingTaco1> He's gonna be dying to this
[1:59:49] <Railgun5> Do you think Woolie's NOT going to play this?
[1:59:49] <Yung_FckUp> wow cool future
[1:59:49] <Mr_Zero5232> Reminds me of a first person katana zero with all the slow mo
[1:59:50] <%BoxNavy> jermaPluto
[1:59:52] <+duskrush> Woolie will more than likely play this, and if he does, your scores on each level are gonna show up for him
[1:59:59] <%cowardlord> I would like to see the player character more
[2:00:01] <%BinaryFireball> hard needs to be fun and fair
[2:00:04] <Sunstalker> Pat, it has a cybernetic arm and a grapplehook LUL this is prime woolie bait
[2:00:11] <sithri> imagine having a casual conversation as the guy just got UGH during his sentence
[2:00:14] <%BoxNavy> woolie talked about this game on the podcast of course hes gonna play it
[2:00:28] <Ikazix> The player character is just a Tenno, doesn't really have much to see.
[2:00:38] <+BlockingDisabled> Make Dharma Great Again!
[2:00:43] <%BoxNavy> Jebaited
[2:00:49] <%logoth_> You cant swim in the bio water
[2:00:57] <agustorm123> Do you wanted to swim?
[2:01:11] <gustavozxd> embarrassing
[2:01:16] <sithri> oh theres a little bit of mirror's edge in this too eh?
[2:01:18] <%DarthPlaugas> Wha
[2:01:37] <sautong97> you can dash off a platform for speed boost similar to a stinger off a platform in DMC
[2:01:38] <%DarthPlaugas> Amazing another protag that can't swim
[2:01:55] <SonicD4> fuck this room is fun
[2:01:56] <Mr_Zero5232> That female voice Sounds like Larissa from the Templin Institute
[2:01:56] <sithri> bro swimming is hard :<
[2:01:57] <+Tesselcraig> Well, this one is a robot, so
[2:01:58] <+VoxelFox51> @DarthPlaugas I mean, he is big robot man
[2:02:03] <%dozind16> dozind16 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 29 months! evening Patato! I raise and toast an onion ring in your honor!
[2:02:04] <Broken_Sonex> @DarthPlaugas How many is that now?
[2:02:06] <%goatbait> I hated this level cuz of this part right here
[2:02:24] <+HitchhikingThrough> Try the L3 thing maybe?
[2:02:37] <+duskrush> he needs to do the dash strafe
[2:02:38] <%BoxNavy> fuck
[2:02:43] <SonicD4> hes saving Blink for emergencies
[2:02:53] <+duskrush> instead of trying to live react
[2:02:54] <sithri> man i'm pretty sure there was a titan fall 2 level that looked like that
[2:02:55] <Captain_Joe1911> :P
[2:02:58] <Saltmeisterr> and rip
[2:02:59] <+kawachipto> loool
[2:03:01] <+sixcubit> unlike Hotline, the cycles in this game are *slightly* different every time you respawn. which makes it way more annoying
[2:03:01] <+Sp3ctre48> LUL
[2:03:01] <gustavozxd> already!?
[2:03:01] <+Shockrates20XX> Fristration Cheese time
[2:03:02] <+Caidezes> oof
[2:03:02] <%BoxNavy> jermaPluto
[2:03:04] <%PrettyThickandStrongDyck> apex time
[2:03:05] <Captain_Joe1911> tansy5Tuntun
[2:03:05] <+Midashu> game is not for Pat
[2:03:06] <%Anime_Flux> you gave it the ol' college try
[2:03:07] <%Lion_kun> short stream huh
[2:03:09] <%SaiyanShoto> LUL LUL
[2:03:09] <Noogiez> shield dorks
[2:03:11] <gustavozxd> FeelsBadMan
[2:03:12] <@SSaryn> A shame, was wishing for the first boss at least
[2:03:15] <Sloavon> just got here LUL
[2:03:17] <AFlyingTaco1> LUL
[2:03:17] <nevan_44> LUL
[2:03:18] <augusta_wind> i felt it coming
[2:03:18] <%wibbwobbler> psaFist
[2:03:21] <%BoxNavy> no :)
[2:03:21] <Hanzmolman> coward
[2:03:22] <Tachyon_Cur> The elevator made me feel like that
[2:03:23] <Broken_Sonex> "But what if i need blink later?",
[2:03:23] <dj_arashi_rora> Pat DEFATED
[2:03:23] <Ikazix> Good enough i guess, you tried.
[2:03:25] <+Tesselcraig> yeah this game does NOT look like it plays well on controller.
[2:03:25] <+duskrush> @PatStaresAt Ancient Gods ruined shields for you forever huh
[2:03:26] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> You said Apex Legends next?
[2:03:27] <%DarthPlaugas> Amazing
[2:03:28] <+kawachipto> game too hard for boomer brain LUL
[2:03:29] <jorniev> one more
[2:03:31] <%Puhff> wha happen
[2:03:31] <julrave> nah fuck it Apex time
[2:03:33] <Grandma_Amari> Yeah I tuned out to it too.
[2:03:35] <+coca9nine> LUL
[2:03:36] <+Clarrynet> not the type of game for our hero
[2:03:37] <%BoxNavy> you can switch games if you wannaaaaa
[2:03:37] <%Puhff> pat no likey?
[2:03:37] <SonicD4> you were doing it right actally
[2:03:40] <%Monkeyweed21> can we send this stream to Scrubquotes @PatStaresAt ?
[2:03:42] <Grandma_Amari> The shield thing really kills the vibe of this
[2:03:50] <%PrettyThickandStrongDyck> Pat do t give in just play apex
[2:03:53] <%Anime_Flux> LUL
[2:04:00] <Gorgs7> I'm sad when you're sad pat, don't play games that you don't wanna
[2:04:00] <akitanito> Shield room
[2:04:02] <+AnthonyJMax> play fall guys?
[2:04:07] <@SSaryn> That's fair
[2:04:17] <Zebroneath> you wanted it like Super Hot?
[2:04:21] <%Lion_kun> Pat, would you consider doing a poll for Y7 dub or sub?
[2:04:25] <Tachyon_Cur> If you don‚Äôt feel like it anymore, you don‚Äôt have to. The shields are a bit of a bummer
[2:04:30] <+duskrush> the shield requires you to dodge more than you would have. 10 times more enemies wouldn't be doable in this game
[2:04:30] <+Tesselcraig> if the shield was on a dude, and could fight back, wasn't just a totem you had to go slash, it would be way more interesting
[2:04:47] <SonicD4> i agree. shield isn't fun mechanic. First boss was a trip though
[2:04:48] <+sixcubit> destroy ORB to enable FUN
[2:04:50] <+schlager087> "If I must suffer through this election, you must play the game with a mechanic you can't stand, Suffer for my enjoyment"
[2:04:52] <OkamiDude15> cucked by level geometry
[2:05:02] <+VoxelFox51> @Tesselcraig there are guys like that too
[2:05:13] <+duskrush> tbh I think Pat's just got residual rage at the Doom Eternal DLC shield dudes
[2:05:14] <Grandma_Amari> Instead of a shield guy, maybe a buffer who makes guys take two hits instead of one, so you don't HAVE to kill him first, it just makes it easier.
[2:05:14] <AFlyingTaco1> Just play Fall Guys for the same level of frustration but with more cuteness
[2:05:16] <Blank9> do a fun roguelike instead, enjoy yourself
[2:05:17] <KaiserMario> @Lion_kun LUL that's cute...
[2:05:18] <gustavozxd> you kinda have to predict shots behind you it seems
[2:05:18] <dj_arashi_rora> @schlager087 yeppers
[2:05:19] <Tachyon_Cur> Good luck, pat, have fun vineChamp
[2:05:20] <%Anime_Flux> I prefer Pat enjoying the game he's playing. This... isn't that.
[2:05:21] <%BoxNavy> you can stop if you want to
[2:05:24] <+Caidezes> Just play Apex.
[2:05:26] <T_Sasquatch> I'll definitely wait on a sale for this
[2:05:32] <%myfaceisapotato> I feel like the shields get in the way of game flow like the stupid difficult combat encounters near the end of mirrors edge did.
[2:05:32] <+Tesselcraig> i know, but i'm talking about the "shielding 3 or 4 dudes" thing.
[2:05:33] <+Clarrynet> lmao, pat is somehow making this game look unfun
[2:05:36] <+coca9nine> The Sheilds kindov limit your freedom in the room and make it so you can only go one or two rooms before you get freedom
[2:05:39] <sithri> i'd say the shield mechanic could be a fun mechanic if they executed it properly without fucking with the momentum
[2:05:42] <%BoxNavy> i mean the game still looks good
[2:05:43] <+paladinstarbuster> the shields the shields
[2:05:45] <+Clarrynet> not sure if thats a game design problem or a pat problem
[2:05:51] <SonicD4> let's go!
[2:05:52] <Noogiez> yes
[2:05:52] <@SSaryn> YOU DID IT
[2:05:56] <@SSaryn> LET'SGOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[2:05:56] <+VoxelFox51> he did it!
[2:06:04] <Broken_Sonex> Yeah, the shield stuff is a deal breaker for me, sorry Ghostrunner.
[2:06:12] <%Puhff> psaUp
[2:06:17] <@SSaryn> Yeah the Shield complaint is super fair
[2:06:18] <gustavozxd> you did it but at what cost FeelsBadMan
[2:06:19] <+extantCadence> Watching someone play this game at a low FoV is actually uncomfortable
[2:06:24] <@SSaryn> Kinda just pads out a lot of rooms in late game.
[2:06:25] <Ikazix> It's more of a Pat problem, the shields are manageable.
[2:06:27] <+Tesselcraig> Pat, unsure if you're aware, but you can slash directly, during your time-slowy blink thing you don't have to dash>slash.
[2:06:27] <sithri> is pat getting past things like that rare? everyone is super hyped
[2:06:35] <+VoxelFox51> slide
[2:06:37] <%BoxNavy> i do like touch of death games but i dont think this ones for me. still looks cool.
[2:06:38] <OkamiDude15> just jump
[2:06:40] <+VoxelFox51> sliding builds up speed
[2:06:46] <+Dobsaur> @extantCadence Feel like have blinders on
[2:06:53] <+TrebassTV> Slide to build momentum
[2:06:54] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> slide
[2:06:55] <T_Sasquatch> @sithri its encouragement
[2:06:55] <SonicD4> slide wall run
[2:06:58] <+Tesselcraig> you can actually move faster than running by sliding to get a little speed boost, jumping out of the slide, then sliding when you hit the ground and repeating.
[2:06:58] <valriot> Pat you can dash
[2:07:07] <+kawachipto> its almost like pat only uses 2 mechanics so far LUL
[2:07:12] <SonicD4> it does suck LUL
[2:07:20] <%BoxNavy> does the game tell you that
[2:07:23] <%DarthPlaugas> Pfft
[2:07:33] <%Fooguwu> it is the game that is wrong
[2:07:38] <%Anime_Flux> THE GREATER GOOD
[2:07:40] <+HitchhikingThrough> SHUT IT
[2:07:43] <+duskrush> THE GREATER GOOD
[2:07:46] <+griffball13> for the greater good
[2:07:47] <@SSaryn> THE GREATER GOOD
[2:07:48] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> ahhh yes, the greater gud.
[2:07:51] <%tonfirean> See, he's a good guy, he cares about good things
[2:07:51] <+AbnormalVoid> sometimes...dead's bettah
[2:07:55] <jorniev> THE GREATER GOOD
[2:07:58] <Grandma_Amari> Oh yeah this is gonna end up with you killing this asshole for sure
[2:07:58] <+sixcubit> microbrain plot writing
[2:07:59] <dj_arashi_rora> Tau sympathizer
[2:08:01] <sithri> i can't wait to see what the bosses are gonna be like for this game
[2:08:01] <valriot> I feel like after this and Doom Eternal, we're seeing "sunset Pat" as his FPS skill drain away
[2:08:04] <SonicD4> level clear!
[2:08:05] <+HitchhikingThrough> I SAID SHUT IT
[2:08:13] <+griffball13> spoken like a true tau
[2:08:19] <%Puhff> fuck his ass?
[2:08:19] <%Monkeyweed21> anything but puzzles
[2:08:21] <+Dobsaur> What if for once you were the bad guy, and 'the greater good' was actually good
[2:08:21] <%DarthPlaugas> Microbrain plot is right
[2:08:21] <@SSaryn> Is this the first boss..? Maybe..?
[2:08:32] <@SSaryn> Probably not.
[2:08:37] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> yeah, at least do the first boss before quitting, I think.
[2:08:38] <%tonfirean> Are there any games where the "for the greater good" people are just straight-up right?
[2:08:42] <Ikazix> Two levels after this, he ain't getting to it i think @SSaryn
[2:08:44] <+HitchhikingThrough> Yeah ok
[2:08:44] <@SSaryn> Oh yeah definitely not first boss yet
[2:08:47] <super_robo_mg> go big fast
[2:08:48] <SonicD4> he has to see shuriken before first boss
[2:08:50] <@SSaryn> Yeah he ain't
[2:08:55] <ballpatter> Mum says that you're a strange orange, orb man and that you're a bad influence on me.
[2:08:56] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> mmmm
[2:08:56] <%animaturgy> Doktor, turn off my speed inhibitors
[2:08:59] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> oh well
[2:09:00] <Grandma_Amari> DOKTOR, REMOVE MY INHIBITORS
[2:09:05] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[2:09:20] <%Puhff> @ssaryn yeah he's a ways off from TOM just yet
[2:09:21] <+VoxelFox51> LOOK UP THE CHUTE
[2:09:31] <+VoxelFox51> down
[2:09:37] <+duskrush> SHHHH
[2:09:38] <@SSaryn> God I love TOM so much
[2:09:39] <jorniev> wow so fast
[2:09:42] <+extantCadence> Breath In is very long level, too
[2:09:43] <+Dobsaur> Literal limit break
[2:09:49] <sithri> are you saying that when you are faster you don't fall faster too? PFFT
[2:09:58] <Ikazix> That is certainly one way to think about Tom, most people hate him.
[2:10:00] <SonicD4> has pat upgraded chip set in a while?
[2:10:02] <%BoxNavy> WOOO
[2:10:11] <rotworks> PAT IM A HUGE FAN! all the way from SIngapore! been a fan since 2bfp days! much love brother!
[2:10:16] <%Anime_Flux> awww
[2:10:16] <akitanito> missed one
[2:10:17] <+HitchhikingThrough> OH THAT"S GARBAGE
[2:10:21] <+VoxelFox51> aww he almost had it
[2:10:22] <Saltmeisterr> yeah
[2:10:26] <%tonfirean> to be fair, these wall-runs aren't how gravity works either.
[2:10:31] <+Tesselcraig> it'
[2:10:32] <akitanito> It's a narrow cone
[2:10:33] <%DarthPlaugas> Oh yea this beat
[2:10:35] <+duskrush> it is a cone
[2:10:39] <@SSaryn> Chat lied it is a line.
[2:10:40] <+Dobsaur> Man bullet time is the best mechanic in any video game it is in no exceptions
[2:10:41] <SonicD4> that was robbery
[2:10:41] <%BoxNavy> you had to aim between them
[2:10:41] <Broken_Sonex> Dat ain't no cone....
[2:10:47] <%OrangeMDT> like a narrow cone
[2:10:47] <+paladinstarbuster> it cone
[2:10:48] <%myfaceisapotato> CyberGravity
[2:10:49] <%cobalt_phoenix_> no you dont
[2:10:49] <%Ranryu692> the later skills are way better
[2:10:50] <@SSaryn> You can make it bigger in due time but yeah, it's a line.
[2:10:51] <Yung_FckUp> ur a cone
[2:10:55] <+Tesselcraig> it's a cone but it snaps to the furthest thing you're looking at. if you aim at a dude close to you, it won't hit the dudes behind him.
[2:10:56] <+VoxelFox51> No they DONT you aim for the destination NOT the enemy
[2:10:56] <+titansloth93> yeah Blink is super finnicky
[2:10:58] <%Monkeyweed21> It just got 2 dudes standing side to side
[2:11:05] <+HitchhikingThrough> Thats right Jay!
[2:11:07] <%BinaryFireball> is a cylinder a cone?
[2:11:11] <Noogiez> so narrow its almost a line
[2:11:11] <+Dobsaur> MonkaS
[2:11:11] <Srthunda> A line is just a small but long cone anyway
[2:11:13] <+duskrush> Trump turned off the airflow
[2:11:19] <OkamiDude15> not just the children but the men and women too jack ghostrunman
[2:11:25] <+VoxelFox51> Blink is my least fav power, which is fine cause the rest are fantastic
[2:11:27] <ballpatter> This feels like mirrors edge meets dishonored
[2:11:31] <dj_arashi_rora> fuck them kids -Jack the Cyber Ninja
[2:11:32] <SonicD4> @SSaryn have you beaten the game yet?
[2:11:36] <+Dobsaur> A line is just a cone, but in a different shape
[2:11:37] <@SSaryn> @SonicD4 Ye.
[2:11:37] <Kain5707> is this just katana zero first person?
[2:11:42] <+extantCadence> Yeah, Blink is a line but the problem is it targets the closer enemy so they really have to be lined up
[2:11:43] <%Anime_Flux> LUL
[2:11:45] <akitanito> super whiffs
[2:11:49] <jorniev> to be honest i kinda feel like playing titan fall 2 now
[2:11:49] <Kain5707> oof
[2:11:52] <+HitchhikingThrough> LUL
[2:11:55] <osaka_daioh> oh boy XD
[2:11:57] <%BoxNavy> katana zeros so fucking good
[2:11:59] <+extantCadence> Like, it's very particular
[2:12:00] <osaka_daioh> That's not a way to talk about a game XD
[2:12:07] <%Anime_Flux> nicely done
[2:12:07] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> nice
[2:12:17] <gustavozxd> bummer
[2:12:18] <@SSaryn> I wouldn't compare the two but hey, I also agree Katana Zero is still better.
[2:12:21] <+Dobsaur> Is this game 'good' good or just streamer good?
[2:12:33] <%AncelDeLambert> cut the "What is this human thing called 'Love'?" crap, Architect
[2:12:34] <Ikazix> Good good.
[2:12:39] <+extantCadence> This game is good good
[2:12:44] <%tonfirean> "I wonder, if I use a voice modulator and an anime waifu avatar, would you be more prone to listen to me"
[2:12:45] <%BoxNavy> what is streamer good
[2:12:46] <%myfaceisapotato> Honestly I like the ruiner aesthetic better than this too... I just want someone to make a REALLY good MIrror's edge so bad LUL
[2:12:49] <+VoxelFox51> Good Good, just not Pat Good
[2:12:51] <+extantCadence> Pat's being really uncharitable to it
[2:12:55] <yourliteraldog> Bruh trying to get my dick wet
[2:13:03] <+HitchhikingThrough> ...I'm not convinced this works without you also being able to take multiple hits.
[2:13:05] <Broken_Sonex> @tonfirean Yes.
[2:13:05] <jorniev> oh god bubble shield again
[2:13:06] <%leinadtonu> This seems to require a lot of skill
[2:13:07] <huskarl_zap> man just wait untill the elevator
[2:13:09] <%Fooguwu> pat is bad so pat is mad
[2:13:10] <%cobalt_phoenix_> is oh the new disc room
[2:13:13] <dj_arashi_rora> oh
[2:13:14] <+Dobsaur> Jump king is streamer good I guess
[2:13:15] <%BoxNavy> ohh....
[2:13:15] <super_robo_mg> Oh!
[2:13:15] <Kain5707> are you just john katana man?
[2:13:15] <%myfaceisapotato> ohhh....
[2:13:20] <sithri> this commentary is STELLAR
[2:13:22] <%AncelDeLambert> guys, stop getting huffy over Pat not liking something
[2:13:23] <+Dobsaur> This looks sick tho I'll cop
[2:13:24] <%sleepers1mulant> Ohhh
[2:13:30] <%BoxNavy> oh is the new disc room
[2:13:31] <dj_arashi_rora> oh x24
[2:13:35] <%Puhff> OoOh
[2:13:35] <+HitchhikingThrough> sourPls oh sourPls
[2:13:36] <jellssssss20> Jack* Katana man
[2:13:36] <SonicD4> my brain
[2:13:37] <spicystarbursts> this game just makes me think about Dishonored
[2:13:37] <%twoto858> disc room
[2:13:37] <%DarthPlaugas> Dhohh
[2:13:37] <jorniev> ooooh
[2:13:38] <%AncelDeLambert> hell, this game should only be played in short bursts, anyways. He's been going at it for over an hour
[2:13:39] <mar_krow> Duh
[2:13:41] <%Monkeyweed21> How dare this game have difficult mechanics that force you to actually think and plan your route
[2:13:43] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> Someone should take Pat's "ohhh"s and put it to this beat
[2:13:44] <%wibbwobbler> !!!
[2:13:55] <%Puhff> !uptime
[2:13:55] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 14m.
[2:13:58] <huskarl_zap> ohh type beat
[2:13:58] <%josstyl_0> Pat, you just like Katana Zero because you have prejudice against 3D games. -Alex Hutchinson
[2:14:03] <sithri> i miss the ohs
[2:14:05] <+Tesselcraig> yeah showing off a "good" run would be cool but there's so many variations on how you can do each room it would be kinda moot.
[2:14:11] <%weissguard> Perhaps a "Ghost Runner" of sorts that would take a "perfect route".
[2:14:13] <%myfaceisapotato> I wish more games did the dustforce thing of putting up top leaderboard runs in-game
[2:14:15] <%AncelDeLambert> @Monkeyweed21 how dare a player complain that the controls are half jank and the game is bad at communicating basic design choices
[2:14:21] <super_robo_mg> the fact that there's no playback in 3rd person, in real time is extremely disappointing
[2:14:24] <+Tesselcraig> between specific upgrades changing the size/effect of your abilities, and different routes through each room
[2:14:30] <SonicD4> @weissguard hire this man
[2:14:33] <Broken_Sonex> @Monkeyweed21 I know, right?
[2:14:46] <Ikazix> The game does no such thing though, jank controls and bad design aren't objective in this case.
[2:15:04] <+Tesselcraig> there is an upgrade to make the range longer
[2:15:05] <Ikazix> There is just the "not my taste" thing, and we can all respect that, i think.;
[2:15:10] <huskarl_zap> Howmany bullets can you eat in the stopped time
[2:15:21] <%Monkeyweed21> @AncelDeLambert the contols aren't jank tho, Pat is rushing too fast, pushing the wrong buttons and not reading how things work
[2:15:21] <Chaos_kun> The new mirrors edge looks interesting
[2:15:24] <+VoxelFox51> LETS GOOO
[2:15:36] <+VoxelFox51> RADAR
[2:15:41] <alextrebeken> there a way to black pre-roll?
[2:15:42] <@SSaryn> LETSGOOOOOOOOOO
[2:15:43] <%cobalt_phoenix_> pat pls you have radar
[2:15:45] <%BoxNavy> theres a radar on your reticle
[2:15:50] <%Ranryu692> how did you miss your minimap and the red arrow on your screen?
[2:15:55] <+HitchhikingThrough> This story is not great
[2:16:02] <%leinadtonu> This kind of game reminds me of break dancing: it looks really cool but I would never be able to do the awesome stuff.
[2:16:07] <dj_arashi_rora> damn son
[2:16:09] <+griffball13> GOT EM
[2:16:13] <%BoxNavy> g-good one...
[2:16:16] <%DarthPlaugas> HA HA HA
[2:16:22] <%Monkeyweed21> @Ranryu692 Pat hasnt even noticed the radar
[2:16:26] <+Dobsaur> LUL Good one man
[2:16:29] <Kain5707> does this game have vineSchut ?
[2:16:30] <%DarthPlaugas> yea...
[2:16:36] <+VoxelFox51> the story of the game is not the games strong point
[2:16:37] <%tonfirean> I like this guy's vibe
[2:16:39] <%AncelDeLambert> @Monkeyweed21 yes, it's TINY
[2:16:42] <huskarl_zap> Dont worry he can say it cause he too is also dead
[2:16:53] <%BoxNavy> sick
[2:16:55] <%Taisuru> This seems like a less funny worse written Shadow Warrior
[2:16:59] <+extantCadence> I am so surprised this game actually has a minimap
[2:17:03] <%Taisuru> *Less fun
[2:17:04] <SonicD4> there ya go
[2:17:04] <masterfire23> is there a parry of sorts
[2:17:04] <%Monkeyweed21> @AncelDeLambert fair, its easy to miss
[2:17:12] <%RiceeFTW> this game is sick, just wish there was a bit more content
[2:17:13] <huskarl_zap> Only dead people can make these jokes
[2:17:18] <akitanito> pat
[2:17:24] <%RiceeFTW> but for $30 it was a quality product
[2:17:29] <%BoxNavy> no :)

[2:17:34] <%cobalt_phoenix_> no wonder that lady offed him
[2:17:39] <julrave> "I'm about to gangham style this guards" - this game probably
[2:17:44] <%tonfirean> "Will you shut up, man?"
[2:17:45] <%AncelDeLambert> no lie, I have no clue what the story is, it's impossible to listen to while you're trailblazing or fighting
[2:17:48] <%Monkeyweed21> @Taisuru this game is nothing like SW tho, outside of the katana
[2:17:48] <%DarthPlaugas> Can he just shut up
[2:17:49] <%moogleboy1984> he should shut up so we can hear the music
[2:17:58] <%Anime_Flux> uuuuugh
[2:18:00] <$RealThiele> i dun wan it
[2:18:02] <Broken_Sonex> Staring to sound like Seth Rollins LUL
[2:18:05] <+griffball13> that is not reasuring
[2:18:06] <dj_arashi_rora> yeah..... fuck this guy
[2:18:07] <%RiceeFTW> @AncelDeLambert you're not missing much, the story is a little cliche and uninspired

[2:18:11] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> uh huh "need to know"
[2:18:13] <%wibbwobbler> ewww
[2:18:14] <+xchasemoney> xchasemoney subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months, currently on a 1 month streak! huh?
[2:18:18] <+HitchhikingThrough> God can you foreshadow any harder? The 3 year olds at the back may not have figured it out

[2:18:32] <aretos1> hmmmm fancy exposition
[2:18:41] <%nahmercy> There's a marker on the screen?

[2:18:50] <%WackyGear> you missed a switch
[2:18:51] <%DarthPlaugas> pfft
[2:18:51] <%AncelDeLambert> this "puzzle" is kinda crap
[2:18:51] <+Tesselcraig> he... he did the parkour loop but didn't push the button.
[2:18:51] <gustavozxd> LUL
[2:18:52] <AllenDeadman> LUL
[2:18:55] <%Ranryu692> you ran around a button a bunch of times and ignored it
[2:18:56] <+VoxelFox51> @PatStaresAt You missed a console
[2:18:56] <yourliteraldog> The Bust
[2:19:01] <SonicD4> you. did it
[2:19:04] <juicebars> Is this a good game or is it a lame ass game?

[2:19:21] <%myfaceisapotato> hm.... I'm starting to think the big scary robot face man that lives in your head might not bet 100% benevolent
[2:19:22] <%cobalt_phoenix_> pat no
[2:19:24] <%Ranryu692> @juicebars it's a good game with some jank
[2:19:25] <+HitchhikingThrough> Pat's playing bad, but it's no 10/10
[2:19:26] <Broken_Sonex> @juicebars Kinnda so-so
[2:19:28] <Kain5707> pat..
[2:19:31] <Yung_FckUp> do the ghostrun go fast
[2:19:31] <%AncelDeLambert> @juicebars it's a Eurojank game. YMMV
[2:19:33] <gustavozxd> @juicebars very mixed it seems
[2:19:34] <+HitchhikingThrough> TILTED
[2:19:37] <%DakotaMacDoodle> I do like how the ghostrunner is wise to his bullshit
[2:19:39] <%nahmercy> And people wonder why developer put on screen marker.
[2:19:46] <%Puhff> why?
[2:19:47] <jorniev> just say it
[2:19:48] <Ikazix> Yam hours.

[2:20:15] <%Monkeyweed21> You've been obviously tired and grumpy and tilted this last week @PatStaresAt
[2:20:15] <+HitchhikingThrough> @Monkeyweed21 Gee, maybe it's because his girlfriend is in the hospital or something
[2:20:15] <+Tesselcraig> you did the parkour bit, got to the button, ran around it in circles a few times, then did the rest of the parkour and got to the second half of the area without pushing the button.
[2:20:16] <jorniev> THAT WAS GHOST RUNNER EVERYONE
[2:20:17] <AFlyingTaco1> CONGRATION YOU DONE IT!
[2:20:17] <Ikazix> Get some rest Pat, you deserve some.

[2:20:22] <$RealThiele> molddowning
[2:20:24] <+extantCadence> @AncelDeLambert Okay, that sounds like your problem
[2:20:25] <Zourath> Have confidence... No confidence
[2:20:26] <Grandma_Amari> With Paige out of commission, Pat is assuming her Sundowning responsibilities
[2:20:27] <gustavozxd> too bitter to die
[2:20:29] <+VoxelFox51> THERE
[2:20:32] <+VoxelFox51> he got it
[2:20:32] <anAngryHamster> But why though?
[2:20:34] <SonicD4> im on the edge now boys
[2:20:38] <PanicSwytch> Pat if u have to stop....stop
[2:20:41] <%StaceMcGate> Pat, if you don't keep streaming, how I will finish grinding my drg to lvl 50?
[2:20:45] <%AncelDeLambert> Okay, HOLD THE FUCK ON, CHAT. How long was your average play session with this game? Cuz you're probably pushing Pat to play this longer than you all did.
[2:20:53] <%Monkeyweed21> @HitchhikingThrough not complaining, I've been exhausted too taking care of my lupus mom
[2:20:57] <jorniev> PLAYING SLEEPY is not fun
[2:21:03] <%BoxNavy> but how though
[2:21:08] <%Ranryu692> what you did earlier
[2:21:09] <+Mowsferatu> It's okay to take one of them there breaks during the sleep
[2:21:12] <akitanito> Get time slow run through both fans
[2:21:13] <%nahmercy> the uellow dot?
[2:21:17] <huskarl_zap> I played for 4 to 5 hours
[2:21:20] <Broken_Sonex> @AncelDeLambert I never bought it Kappa
[2:21:24] <%nahmercy> Just rest my man
[2:21:24] <huskarl_zap> which is 90 percent
[2:21:26] <%Taisuru> I believe in you Diet Coke Can
[2:21:34] <Ikazix> I'm fairly sure it's possible to no life this game in a day, depends on what quarantine did to you.;
[2:21:41] <SonicD4> i got 4.6 hours but i did it over days
[2:21:43] <+extantCadence> @AncelDeLambert I think I finished the first boss
[2:21:56] <%Monkeyweed21> Pat you can do shorter streams for the time being, its all good
[2:22:03] <huskarl_zap> Its six hours at most
[2:22:03] <SonicD4> SPEED
[2:22:04] <+VoxelFox51> He dit it!
[2:22:06] <akitanito> You did it
[2:22:08] <%Ranryu692> huzzah!
[2:22:08] <%BoxNavy> youve done it
[2:22:23] <%AncelDeLambert> grasshoper mofos
[2:22:29] <%tonfirean> I'm different!
[2:22:36] <sithri> these seem easier than the gun ones
[2:22:38] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> I'mma scawed.
[2:22:39] <%myfaceisapotato> they look sweet tho
[2:22:44] <%DarthPlaugas> They suck so much
[2:22:45] <huskarl_zap> If cars taught pat one thing its speed
[2:22:45] <SonicD4> then you get four of them with two gunners
[2:22:46] <%AncelDeLambert> how on earth did Pat get the Derp Patrol for his first cyborg enemies?
[2:22:46] <%sleepers1mulant> NEVER SLOW DOWN
[2:22:47] <akitanito> Better than gun guys
[2:22:51] <jorniev> neat
[2:22:53] <+HitchhikingThrough> *dial up noises*
[2:23:01] <%tonfirean> "Mara's doling them out bit by bit to give you a chance to get used to the mechanics"
[2:23:02] <jorniev> BETTER THAN BUBBLE SHIELDS
[2:23:09] <%DarthPlaugas> He slows down more for directions than the enemies
[2:23:14] <+HitchhikingThrough> Also holy fuck game, you wanna go above 20 fps maybe?
[2:23:19] <akitanito> reflect
[2:23:33] <+HitchhikingThrough> Fuck you, learn to parry
[2:23:33] <%AncelDeLambert> yeah I don't like the parry window
[2:23:35] <akitanito> Use focus?
[2:23:35] <PanicSwytch> F
[2:23:37] <%leinadtonu> Playing this for long sounds exhausting, I don't see myself having that much patience...
[2:23:39] <%Taisuru> TIme to put those years of third strike to use pat
[2:23:41] <%toastybites> maybe slow down LUL
[2:23:42] <%josstyl_0> i feel like the twist of this game will be, "Oh no! It was ME who was the oppressor!"
[2:23:42] <%wibbwobbler> l3?
[2:23:45] <Broken_Sonex> Oh these guys are easier than the melee guys?!
[2:23:46] <+kawachipto> you can slow time and reflect...
[2:23:48] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat, just jump and use the time slow
[2:23:50] <huskarl_zap> jump dash to side step
[2:23:53] <%myfaceisapotato> use dashy
[2:23:54] <+VoxelFox51> @HitchhikingThrough It actually runs are a smooth 60fps when ya know, not streaming
[2:24:03] <%BoxNavy> dont slow down time only a bitch would do that
[2:24:15] <%ClericOfSparda> Nice
[2:24:22] <%DarthPlaugas> Perfect your royal guard
[2:24:26] <anAngryHamster> Use your abilities Pat, stop handicapping yourself
[2:24:26] <+jjacksterup> why does he only slow down in air
[2:24:29] <%Dakuu75> radiation is no bueno
[2:24:30] <+duskrush> I think pat's refusal to use the strafe is lending to his suffering
[2:24:42] <$RealThiele> if they feel them they are probably already dead from radiation poisoning
[2:24:47] <+VoxelFox51> well hes gota now
[2:24:48] <huskarl_zap> Oh ho jump puncher youre approaching me?
[2:24:48] <SonicD4> @jjacksterup because thats the only time you can slow down by holding dash
[2:24:50] <Broken_Sonex> Pat can't slow down time when he want's. That's not how his Stand works.
[2:24:52] <+titansloth93> oh shit guys I'm feeling effects
[2:25:03] <%AncelDeLambert> they do have SOME tracking
[2:25:05] <akitanito> Well they did limit your movement here
[2:25:10] <%Taisuru> Area denial basically
[2:25:12] <+duskrush> they can hit you on walls
[2:25:14] <%AncelDeLambert> @PatStaresAt their main threat is that they actually MOVE. So they can surround you
[2:25:19] <%myfaceisapotato> Same as gun dudes, only get scary when there's like 10 in a room
[2:25:19] <+VoxelFox51> and the area where they land is insta kill
[2:25:19] <akitanito> Can't you just ignore him?
[2:25:28] <sithri> they look like a distraction
[2:25:28] <+Tesselcraig> unless i'm mistaken, if you try to hit them midair, they win the clash.
[2:25:29] <%DarthPlaugas> DID HE RUN INTO THE KILL BEAM?? LUL
[2:25:31] <gustavozxd> LUL
[2:25:37] <$RealThiele> zone denial works well for them
[2:25:38] <%DarthPlaugas> The enemy not pat I mean
[2:25:39] <%Ranryu692> nah, you have to kill most enemies
[2:25:51] <+extantCadence> You can't really leave them alone cause they'll get you while you're focusing on other enemies
[2:25:54] <%Taisuru> LUL
[2:25:54] <%Puhff> they're more meant to bully you around

[2:29:15] <gustavozxd> @chat Woolie couldn't remember a single detail about Transistor's ending other than the boss fight
[2:29:19] <akitanito> Just do it
[2:29:19] <%PrettyThickandStrongDyck> Pat's dick is just too huge for paige

[2:29:39] <@SSaryn> I think But How needs to be an emote
[2:29:48] <%AncelDeLambert> Chat, have mercy, Pat is an old and needs to rest his nerve endings
[2:29:50] <gustavozxd> such a massive plot point that he... forgot?
[2:29:51] <Broken_Sonex> The ending of Woolie's favourite game SUCKS btw
[2:29:53] <SonicD4> ^
[2:29:54] <T_Sasquatch> Thats fine, do you need to remember every detail of your favorite game LUL especially if you played it years ago
[2:29:58] <+duskrush> I never noticed until just now how much Matrix Reloaded shit there is in this
[2:29:59] <%cobalt_phoenix_> man fuck this part
[2:30:20] <+duskrush> I love that the enemies trash talk
[2:30:25] <gustavozxd> @T_Sasquatch the problem is that the ending is a massive plot twist and kinda hard to forget
[2:30:25] <+VoxelFox51> ayy hes gettin now
[2:30:26] <%AncelDeLambert> @duskrush at least no-one is fucking during a rave
[2:30:27] <+duskrush> loved that in F.E.A.R. too
[2:30:33] <gustavozxd> especially if you like the game
[2:30:47] <Solidnick18> this reminds me of shadow warrior abit
[2:30:48] <+duskrush> @AncelDeLambert not yet
[2:31:03] <+duskrush> that's Mara's plan. a rave orgy
[2:31:03] <%tonfirean> What's Woolie's favorite game in this context?
[2:31:12] <%AncelDeLambert> fuck that last guy on that ledge, FUCK trying to get to him
[2:31:12] <gustavozxd> is paige doing better now?
[2:31:16] <SonicD4> chilly paige?

[2:31:21] <%rumtumtugnutz> pat are you giving paige butt flu
[2:31:25] <%AncelDeLambert> @tonfirean Transistor
[2:31:30] <Kain5707> @gustavozxd shes walking! PogChamp
[2:31:35] <%Monkeyweed21> Woolie completely forgot the ending of Transistor
[2:31:38] <that_guy_from_high_school> Is there a bullet deflect in this game? It feels like thats going to be an ability in this game?
[2:31:39] <+duskrush> Pat: So you came back to die with your city Paige: No, I came to stop you
[2:31:46] <%tonfirean> ah, thanks.
[2:31:52] <huskarl_zap> Southern chili expert pat
[2:31:58] <akitanito> what
[2:31:59] <%AncelDeLambert> I love the little journey Paige went on, there
[2:32:00] <%moogleboy1984> she doesn't eat Dinoasaurs?
[2:32:01] <+extantCadence> It really doesn't feel like Pat is trying to beat this room
[2:32:07] <+duskrush> @that_guy_from_high_school there is. he's got it equipped
[2:32:07] <%rumtumtugnutz> ew
[2:32:13] <%AncelDeLambert> Paige, dinosaurs are delicious!
[2:32:13] <Djinnazz> Wow, this guys got your number.
[2:32:19] <DexteraXIII> Turkey chili is the shit
[2:32:21] <+VoxelFox51> thats the threat of the fist guys
[2:32:23] <%DappercatEsquire> @that_guy_from_high_school there is a deflect, timing is kinda finicky
[2:32:24] <sammietheslug> BibleThump I can't believe it's the real Pat. I've been watching you since high school. So much nostalgia
[2:32:29] <+sixcubit> why does anyone in this game wear armor if it's this useless
[2:32:30] <%rumtumtugnutz> turkey in chili is fine, chicken in chili tastes like hotdogs
[2:32:32] <Kain5707> this is a disk room
[2:32:33] <that_guy_from_high_school> @duskrush thanks
[2:32:39] <xbb1024> Has Pat been playing for 2 hours continuously?
[2:32:49] <Ikazix> Yep, he's a tired boy.
[2:32:52] <%AncelDeLambert> I tried sliding under that laser wall twice, died both times
[2:32:53] <%BubbaRands> Ground turkey in chili is fine
[2:32:55] <akitanito> You should
[2:32:57] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> yeah
[2:33:02] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> feel free to
[2:33:02] <%wibbwobbler> apex?
[2:33:04] <%rumtumtugnutz> this game gives me anxiety
[2:33:04] <%Ranryu692> change your katana color first
[2:33:05] <Kain5707> time for disk @PatStaresAt
[2:33:06] <SonicD4> small break, rejuice, next bit
[2:33:07] <FboyDaKing> how can u when u played the ancient ones dlc
[2:33:08] <%tonfirean> that's because it's not a cone, it's a frustum
[2:33:10] <%AncelDeLambert> this game is meant to be played in tiny portions. Itty bitty ninja cakes
[2:33:11] <Broken_Sonex> So, yeah, if Woolie's gonna be like, "Well you just gotta get the hang of it, tho" I'm gonna shot up the place.
[2:33:15] <+sixcubit> how much longer till the boss?
[2:33:16] <%DappercatEsquire> did he fight Tom? i feel like pat will hate that fight
[2:33:24] <@SSaryn> Nah no TOM yet.
[2:33:28] <Grandma_Amari> It feels more like a puzzle game than I like.
[2:33:28] <ammobasket> nice soundtrack tho
[2:33:29] <+VoxelFox51> U DID IT
[2:33:30] <T_Sasquatch> Frustration is getting bigger
[2:33:36] <huskarl_zap> foof
[2:33:39] <spiderously> I smell a big discussion on this week's podcast
[2:33:39] <%cobalt_phoenix_> monkaS
[2:33:43] <Saltmeisterr> whens 1st boss?
[2:33:43] <%BubbaRands> Take smol baby bites of game
[2:33:44] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> yeah this feels like you shouldn't eat the entire cake in one sitting kinda game.
[2:33:44] <+VoxelFox51> @Grandma_Amari every encounter is a puzzle
[2:33:45] <%AncelDeLambert> god, when does a boss come up? I got mega pissed at the laser elevator before the stream
[2:33:54] <huskarl_zap> No
[2:33:56] <%Monkeyweed21> This is not a game to play when you are tired, no one will hold it against you
[2:33:56] <SonicD4> nope
[2:33:57] <%DappercatEsquire> i just want to see him hit the boss before giving it up
[2:33:57] <Ikazix> Uh, one more level after this i think.
[2:33:58] <+VoxelFox51> @PatStaresAt yes it is
[2:34:00] <Ikazix> Boss is hard as fuck too.
[2:34:04] <@SSaryn> One more level after I think.
[2:34:08] <huskarl_zap> What?
[2:34:10] <@SSaryn> Ima check real quick
[2:34:16] <Ikazix> So yeah, go cool down a lil' and come back later if you feel like it.
[2:34:16] <dj_arashi_rora> BANG BANG BANG pull my cyber trigger
[2:34:17] <%Ranryu692> you're almost halfway through this level

[2:34:29] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> wow, they shielded too
[2:34:31] <gustavozxd> almost halfway!?
[2:34:33] <%AncelDeLambert> there's a power he has to get, and then an infuriating laser dodging puzzle that I've at least seen
[2:34:37] <+VoxelFox51> @huskarl_zap yes
[2:34:41] <Broken_Sonex> Pat, just play something else, who cares.
[2:34:50] <huskarl_zap> thought so
[2:34:50] <spiderously> WAIT! Is Paige back home? HEY PAIGE! Glad you're feeling better.
[2:34:54] <+Tesselcraig> the first boss is about halfway through the game, yes.
[2:34:56] <Kain5707> hacking this
[2:35:00] <SonicD4> this is the room is was thinking of when Pat said they are scary
[2:35:02] <Admiral_PopnFresh> yo is this like Shadow warrior x Titanfall?
[2:35:09] <SonicD4> and hes right. they are just awful
[2:35:11] <huskarl_zap> no
[2:35:13] <Yung_FckUp> overclock your fridge
[2:35:18] <%tonfirean> "At best we can mine a fraction of a bitcoin over its lifetime"
[2:35:20] <xbb1024> You hack someone's Fridge to make it not cool
[2:35:22] <%DakotaMacDoodle> Hack the fridge hack da WORLD!
[2:35:25] <+Donchalant402> that just reminded me of the first boss of megaman battlenetwork
[2:35:30] <@SSaryn> Yeah sadly boss is one level after this
[2:35:31] <huskarl_zap> Even the fridge spys on you
[2:35:34] <%AncelDeLambert> LUL
[2:35:36] <+Donchalant402> no wait that was an oven
[2:35:37] <SonicD4> much faster than my attempts
[2:35:38] <Ikazix> They just lined up at ya.
[2:35:41] <+extantCadence> There's actually 2 more levels before the boss
[2:35:42] <akitanito> Hack the fridge
[2:35:44] <Solidnick18> yes
[2:35:49] <%BoxNavy> OH NO
[2:35:50] <%BubbaRands> I‚Äôd like a hack fridge. Mine only plays Skyrim
[2:35:54] <@SSaryn> Depending on how well you do, the next level is pretty short tho.

[2:37:42] <tanarath> 3 * 20 = 600? @patstaresat
[2:37:43] <%JeanGardner99> this man about to do 600 fates for his relics
[2:37:46] <Solidnick18> ewww maths
[2:37:47] <%JeanGardner99> absolute madman
[2:37:49] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> 600=60
[2:37:49] <%GalacticaPhanto> Yeah it sucks dude
[2:37:50] <T_Sasquatch> oh apex ?
[2:37:51] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> give yourself a jerkoff sesh. You deserve it.
[2:37:51] <T_Sasquatch> LUL
[2:38:09] <yourliteraldog> Ywah rub one out
[2:38:10] <masterfire23> the new apex update kinda slaps
[2:38:12] <chaumiester> Is this the end for tonight?
[2:38:13] <%DappercatEsquire> got in late, take it here just want a fan of Ghostrunner?
[2:38:15] <%sleepers1mulant> Mute your mic before you blast rope pat
[2:38:29] <Broken_Sonex> Well, that was Ghostrunner, huh? Not gonna buy it
[2:38:34] <%GalacticaPhanto> real talk this game started off pretty strong but since the old man was the comic relief it started to get annoying
[2:38:41] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> I might on sale
[2:38:44] <+extantCadence> It's actually like 1000 fates to finish the step for every relic
[2:38:59] <Broken_Sonex> Just seems too hard.
[2:39:27] <Saltmeisterr> seems like u constantly get hit by enemies off screen
[2:39:29] <SonicD4> think this game is supposed to be played a level at a time because it just taxes
[2:39:31] <+extantCadence> It is definitely difficult
[2:39:35] <SonicD4> 7.5/10
[2:39:48] <Saltmeisterr> which is never fun
[2:40:05] <%DappercatEsquire> Ghostrunner is pretty unapologetically difficult, but I thought it was a tight, focused experience that is definitely not for everyone
[2:40:11] <+extantCadence> It's not really off-screen enemies
[2:40:26] <Broken_Sonex> I give it a...... Not For Me, Too Hard/10
[2:40:33] <%rumtumtugnutz> dickmeezer
[2:40:41] <jorniev> IM GONNA CALL IT

[2:48:52] <Broken_Sonex> Apex is a game that's good, but nobody cares.
[2:48:52] <%BoxNavy> he does this every time
[2:48:57] <%TheWinged7> your big small pat rn
[2:48:58] <+Das_Prints> Bloodhound got crazy buffed over the last couple seasons. They are great now.
[2:48:59] <MyNameIsRasus> the reason apex is not as popular is beacuse its sfm porn is not good enough
[2:48:59] <@SoFarFetched> YoU'RE GETTING OLD PAT

[2:49:45] <%SirKeigan> Oh man when did you switch over? I was watching something else
[2:49:46] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> tomatoPuke Loot Boxes
[2:49:49] <+someguy1472> Oh god, I forgot about the ghost suck lore.
[2:49:53] <cstro> I forgot how good games can look when you play them without turning everything off
[2:49:53] <%leinadtonu> Is this a lootbox stream?
[2:49:57] <%SirKeigan> Console people are only with PC people if they are in a party together
[2:49:58] <%Monkeyweed21> at least its not Gacha
[2:49:59] <MyNameIsRasus> Fs for BT in chat
[2:50:00] <Solidnick18> shoot bang
[2:50:00] <%SirKeigan> Play Duos dude
[2:50:05] <TigerClaws12> it has duos right?
[2:50:05] <@SSaryn> Apex devs shot that down so yeah.
[2:50:07] <+tangoragahn> SHHOT DA GUN
[2:50:07] <huskarl_zap> f
[2:50:07] <@SSaryn> Also yeah it is.
[2:50:07] <masterfire23> gacha pulls
[2:50:09] <laserbeaming> Does PC enable aim assist when playing with a controller?
[2:50:10] <+Das_Prints> Games fun, the monetization for cosmetics has always been not that great.
[2:50:12] <%BoxNavy> worse than genshins?>
[2:50:15] <Solidnick18> it's pretty fucked
[2:50:16] <%SirKeigan> @patstaresat DUOS IS THE CLOSEST THING
[2:50:16] <critfumble_> console players are only in pc lobbies if they're invited by other pc players
[2:50:19] <%leinadtonu> cool
[2:50:21] <%SirKeigan> It's really not
[2:50:21] <AFlyingTaco1> I wish Apex had a mode other than fucking Battle Royale
[2:50:23] <Zebroneath> This seasons battle pass is shit terrible
[2:50:24] <%Monkeyweed21> they ran solo events and no one liked it
[2:50:24] <%NKOrange> Oh it‚Äôs fucked
[2:50:26] <%SirKeigan> They updated that toda
[2:50:28] <DarkSideCow> you can link your old account to your origin account if you log into it real quick
[2:50:29] <%barrakuta371> It's the worst battle pass for Apex so far
[2:50:31] <+paladinstarbuster> You dont have to stay with your team if you dont want too
[2:50:35] <%SirKeigan> The rewwards are shit but they are easy to get
[2:50:37] <SociallyAwkwardToaster> It's the classic EA "oh haha it sucks, we'll pretend to fix it but not really, give us money" thing
[2:50:37] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> mama didn't raise no battle pass chump.
[2:50:41] <AFlyingTaco1> Literally just throw a TDM mode into this and I'd play the fuck out of it
[2:50:44] <@SSaryn> It's half the amount of EXP now but yeah it's still a struggle.
[2:50:44] <+Das_Prints> The last couple season the battle pass was fine but they changed it this season and made it way grindier.
[2:50:45] <Grandma_Amari> Yeah there's complaints about it, people are saying it's a tactic to try and make the next awful pass more palatable by not making it -AS- awful.
[2:50:47] <+duskrush> Nah that's Fortnite. No one even REMEMBERS that Fortnite has a paid main mode
[2:50:49] <Solidnick18> they also said they aren't master manipulaters
[2:50:51] <%BoxNavy> i like pathfinder :)
[2:50:54] <Broken_Sonex> Apex is GOOD. It's just that no one CARES.
[2:50:58] <+someguy1472> Oh wow, there are like 50% more dudes you can choose.
[2:51:00] <huskarl_zap> I dint think this is what Bisk meant.
[2:51:00] <Saltmeisterr> so what does the new scottish lady do?
[2:51:03] <+A0N33> They like tripled the cost then say "Sorry, we're listening" and went down to double the xp cost
[2:51:04] <%saltenergy> Play Solos by hot dropping whats your team gonna do? Follow?
[2:51:05] <augusta_wind> cool robot!!
[2:51:07] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Oh the battlepass is GARBAGE
[2:51:07] <%ssjklyco> Is this the not destiny?
[2:51:08] <%SirKeigan> It's 5,000 now instead of 10.000 and some challenges were made easier so instead of 5 wins it's only 2
[2:51:13] <crassplay_> They "fixed" the battle pass but it is still worse than old passes were and are trying to still screw people over while looking like they care @PatStaresAt
[2:51:17] <+LordSDB> GOOD LUCK PAT!!! woolieCHAN woolieCHAN woolieCHAN
[2:51:19] <Saltmeisterr> i haven't seen much of her

[2:51:46] <%barrakuta371> Replicator is where you can craft specific loot
[2:51:46] <Hippoleon> It's less crafting and more a shop

[2:53:43] <+VoxelFox51> theres an infinity symbol below the ammon count

[2:55:39] <+Dova573> Oh did they make light smg not a golden weapon anymore?
[2:55:40] <%SirKeigan> Try duos. It's a lot closer to Solos than you think @PatStaresAt
[2:55:41] <%barrakuta371> At least you got 1 kill
[2:55:43] <kryedge> Playing right now, see you there
[2:55:44] <$Savages4Blood> @patstaresat I've been watching old vods and I was wondering... any idea what happened to Wyoming farmer? I know they were sick and now I dont see them in the streams anymore
[2:55:47] <yourliteraldog> no titan fal :(
[2:55:48] <+Dova573> nice
[2:55:49] <%sleepers1mulant> You got a kill!!
[2:55:51] <%barrakuta371> psaDogchamp
[2:55:53] <critfumble_> they arnt. it's that's the street mode name hider
[2:55:54] <+Das_Prints> @jimmyruss you can turn on streamer mode to hide names of the people in the match to prevent stream sniping.
[2:55:55] <Bloodninja15> HyperCrate doodbenny
[2:55:57] <ThisGuy198> Pat you didn't b0lieve
[2:55:58] <GameBoyGus> GG
[2:56:00] <%Ner234> I just got here. Was Apex Legends on the schedule or was there a change in plans?
[2:56:01] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> Pat did you and Woolie ever talk about Cannon Busters on the Podcast?
[2:56:02] <MyNameIsRasus> @JimmyRuss streamer mode
[2:56:03] <@SoFarFetched> @Savages4Blood They were banned because their stuff was getting to a "bad place"
[2:56:05] <+el_machucapapas> It's all about mobility Pat
[2:56:06] <%AlteisenReiseZ> @Dova573 R-99 is a regular drop again, Prowler is the Care package weapon this season
[2:56:07] <+Dova573> Yeah try duos
[2:56:07] <@SSaryn> Pretty much
[2:56:08] <+ShadowForceX75> check out the character horizon you'll like her
[2:56:13] <%SirKeigan> You don't have to spend money on characters
[2:56:13] <+Big_Gay_Skeleton> @Dova573 the prowler is a light smg and its in the care package now
[2:56:14] <ninjaguiden> Nice to be able to watch you again Pat!
[2:56:14] <@SSaryn> And if you get lucky, maybe get a Legendary.
[2:56:15] <%barrakuta371> Yeah pretty much
[2:56:20] <%SirKeigan> You get them with level upgrades
[2:56:24] <SociallyAwkwardToaster> yep
[2:56:24] <kryedge> I see you play best character, gj
[2:56:25] <T_Sasquatch> Loba Kreygasm
[2:56:25] <+MoroseLoki> Can you buy Characters?
[2:56:26] <%SirKeigan> You don't need to buy the characters lol
[2:56:27] <AFlyingTaco1> Just get Loba's big ass and that's all you need
[2:56:29] <%BoxNavy> buy a character on stream
[2:56:29] <+Big_Gay_Skeleton> or well heavy smg woops
[2:56:31] <kryedge> Thee battle pass is not bad honestly
[2:56:31] <Saltmeisterr> @ShadowForceX75 what does horizon do?
[2:56:33] <+demon1103> characters are overpriced....so dont buy those either
[2:56:34] <coreybom> @dova573 nah. Thats the heavy smg now. Plus, they changed up the how the gold works.
[2:56:34] <+el_machucapapas> Never land in hot spots
[2:56:34] <%Monkeyweed21> they have a $40 version that gives all the characters and the battlepass btw @PatStaresAt
[2:56:38] <$Savages4Blood> oh geez. alright thanks sofarfetched
[2:56:39] <MyNameIsRasus> grab loba's ass
[2:56:41] <+VoxelFox51> I mean, its still EA so I wouldnt even BUY a character
[2:56:42] <+Dova573> @AlteisenReiseZ Thats seems weird never thought the prowler was that good
[2:56:42] <Gorgs7> or just don't buy the game
[2:56:44] <+Das_Prints> If I were to change one major thing in this game it would be that the characters were just free.
[2:56:45] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Octane is my boy though
[2:56:46] <%sleepers1mulant> Pat get caustic
[2:56:47] <+someguy1472> Second 1: Mute squad
[2:56:48] <Robert_Eccles> Going for that door in the face strategy with the current battle pass
[2:56:49] <SinisterTofu> POCKETS
[2:56:53] <%SirKeigan> Montreal servers?
[2:56:53] <%BestTeaMaker> what happened to ghostrunner?
[2:56:54] <%OrangeMDT> you haven't seen the cool $10 costumes yet
[2:57:01] <AFlyingTaco1> Yup
[2:57:02] <%NKOrange> But my doll needs to be special and shiny
[2:57:02] <@SoFarFetched> @BestTeaMaker gave up,now it's Apex
[2:57:02] <+Das_Prints> Well actually there‚Äôs be a couple others but that‚Äôs be a big one.
[2:57:02] <kryedge> Caustic is 100% vpat
[2:57:03] <critfumble_> they really arnt over priced lmao it doesn't take long to get 12k red coins
[2:57:03] <%SirKeigan> Dude, you would enjoy this game a lot more if you played with friends
[2:57:04] <%logoth_> That guy with the blue hammer will carry
[2:57:04] <cstro> I did the battle pass this season because I did it fully last one, and at least I can keep rolling over the credits
[2:57:08] <+RootVeggie> My only gripe is that I wish gunplay felt a little closer to Titanfall
[2:57:13] <%Agami23> hey so i left abit. why is pat playing apex now? was ghosst runner a stinker?
[2:57:14] <ItsEzKill> yoou playing on steam?
[2:57:15] <%DakotaMacDoodle> Ping system is really good because always mute
[2:57:28] <MyNameIsRasus> remember that game awards ad that was super cringe
[2:57:28] <AFlyingTaco1> @SirKeigan Like who? Woolie!?
[2:57:31] <kryedge> imagine playing in origin XD
[2:57:31] <%barrakuta371> Ping was this game's biggest contribution to gaming
[2:57:34] <Bloodninja15> got a billion red coins laying around
[2:57:37] <+Big_Gay_Skeleton> I think the gunplay is on point with TiF2, better in some cases since theres less hitscan
[2:57:38] <%SirKeigan> Paige and Plague maybe
[2:57:42] <nepwar> Back in the 60s, when i was 20
[2:57:45] <ThisGuy198> Won't let the squad get even a single gamer word in?
[2:57:45] <+LimpBisquicks> YYOO I haven't touched apex since the first month, that's a sick looking map
[2:57:47] <AFlyingTaco1> So in your youth
[2:57:47] <ninjaguiden> I feel sad from remembering how Mandalore points out how much people talk in Mechwarrior online
[2:57:54] <%SirKeigan> Paige won a chicken dinner in PUBG
[2:57:56] <$Savages4Blood> anyone use horizon yet? thoughts?
[2:57:56] <%Dakuu75> yeah... young ppl are shits
[2:57:57] <+Big_Gay_Skeleton> the movement is nerfed for sure but it's still respawns' great gunplay
[2:58:00] <%BinaryFireball> what changed?
[2:58:05] <Slim_Lipid> Now you're weak :)
[2:58:07] <ItsEzKill> do you need origin or not anymore??
[2:58:09] <%logoth_> get dat armor
[2:58:09] <+RetroGiinthir> mute all can be toggled permanantly in settings
[2:58:11] <+someguy1472> Somewhere on youtube, there is footage of Toxic Pat yelling at people playing Street fighter.
[2:58:12] <nepwar> now thats been relegated to twitter
[2:58:12] <Oxybe> does this game have solo play? or are you still forced to play triples? i tried when it came out but i dislike the forced triple
[2:58:12] <+Das_Prints> @limpbisquicks it‚Äôs a pretty fun new map. It has vehicles too.
[2:58:15] <%SirKeigan> Horizon is fun
[2:58:16] <huskarl_zap> canadians just want see the world burn
[2:58:20] <%SirKeigan> Better Octane cuz she gets them faster
[2:58:20] <%Ynkubus_> Pat aint hip with the kids no more
[2:58:21] <AFlyingTaco1> Man I see this and just get depressed about Titanfall
[2:58:22] <yourliteraldog> Here the N-words
[2:58:28] <@SSaryn> It's essentially your extra Daily.
[2:58:29] <+Big_Gay_Skeleton> Horizon is great because of her airstrafe passive makes move great
[2:58:40] <+Das_Prints> @oxybe They have said they will not do solos outside of events but they did add a duos queue.
[2:58:42] <%sleepers1mulant> YEAH THE TREASURE PACKS
[2:58:46] <%SirKeigan> @Oxybe They added permanent duos
[2:58:49] <%logoth_> pick up the armor pat
[2:58:50] <kryedge> They didn't do that
[2:58:51] <%OrangeMDT> *they, you monster
[2:58:54] <+SimplyPandaz> Oh boy the reaction times
[2:58:56] <kryedge> Non binary character
[2:58:56] <+someguy1472> Oh wait, it was taken down
[2:58:56] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Get armor you fool
[2:58:56] <%Monkeyweed21> Bloodhound has no gender @PatStaresAt
[2:58:57] <%SweetCheeksTVR> Pat, I wanna thank you for being indirectly responsible for turning one of my streams into a podcast about some REAL dumb shit.
[2:58:58] <+Fynale> They you mean
[2:58:59] <TigerClaws12> a bique LUL
[2:59:01] <+RootVeggie> Treasure packs are basically how you progress in-game events
[2:59:01] <%SirKeigan> faster
[2:59:02] <yourliteraldog> Imagine how fun these maps would be with titan fall movement
[2:59:04] <%SirKeigan> loot faster lol
[2:59:07] <%logoth_> Heals
[2:59:09] <+Fynale> bloodhund is only a hunter
[2:59:11] <%SirKeigan> heal?
[2:59:15] <+ShadowForceX75> guys he doesn't know the lore take it easy
[2:59:15] <%SirKeigan> Jesus.........
[2:59:16] <%logoth_> Bloodhound got big buffed
[2:59:18] <%GalacticaPhanto> @patstaresat They
[2:59:23] <%sleepers1mulant> PAT STOP LOOTING AND HELP
[2:59:26] <Oxybe> @Das_Prints dang
[2:59:26] <%logoth_> When you do 150 damage your armor gets upgraded
[2:59:26] <+Big_Gay_Skeleton> next evo is your armor level
[2:59:28] <cstro> Shield lvl up on damage
[2:59:28] <+ThomasOfTroy> When your shield upgrades next
[2:59:29] <%barrakuta371> Are having fun Pat?
[2:59:29] <%BoxNavy> theres never going to be another evo
[2:59:29] <%koolaid_kevster> nescxt evoilve
[2:59:30] <laserbeaming> Something that will never happen
[2:59:30] <critfumble_> deal damage to upgrade shields
[2:59:31] <%AncelDeLambert> did they change the medkit model?
[2:59:31] <Saltmeisterr> shields level up now
[2:59:32] <+ShadowForceX75> do damage get armor
[2:59:32] <%Monkeyweed21> Do damage to upgrade armor @PatStaresAt
[2:59:34] <MyNameIsRasus> in like 6 months
[2:59:34] <%AncelDeLambert> it looks different
[2:59:35] <yourliteraldog> @SweetCheeksTVR what was the dumb shit
[2:59:36] <%SirKeigan> Your shield upgrades when you do x amount of damage
[2:59:36] <Zebroneath> If you do enough damage, your shield gets upgraded
[2:59:36] <AFlyingTaco1> It's EVO 2021
[2:59:37] <SociallyAwkwardToaster> Next Evo = how much damage you need to do to level up your shield
[2:59:39] <BlindBarghest> Oh no Pat's aim is better than mine NotLikeThis
[2:59:40] <+Big_Gay_Skeleton> you deal damage to non downed enemies to upgrade it
[2:59:41] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> something that won't happen
[2:59:42] <+Dova573> amount dmg before upgrade
[2:59:42] <@SoFarFetched> Next Evo is when all the smash players are gone Kappa
[2:59:42] <+Fynale> shields become betters hields based off damage
[2:59:43] <Lolcola34> if you do enough damage armor upgrades
[2:59:44] <%logoth_> Armor gets extra health after you do damage
[2:59:45] <+R_BChe> u can level up ur armor
[2:59:46] <huskarl_zap> Kane died for your apex sins
[2:59:47] <@SSaryn> Armor now acts as, do enough damage, upgrade armor.
[2:59:52] <+MoroseLoki> I don't
[2:59:54] <%SirKeigan> you need the barrel stabilizer lol
[2:59:57] <%SirKeigan> put on all attachments
[3:00:08] <+someguy1472> Evo is dead, or Evo is going to jail? I haven't kept up on it.
[3:00:10] <%Monkeyweed21> do damage to upgrade to blue, purple, then red
[3:00:14] <Profmcstevie> Do good to do good
[3:00:16] <+ThomasOfTroy> fyi, you can see tracks through sniper scopes
[3:00:18] <@SSaryn> And you can still get Blue and Purple, but to get your Red, you gotta INVEST.
[3:00:21] <+Das_Prints> Every level of damage the armor gets another pip of 25 health up to 125 hp (5 bars)
[3:00:22] <+RootVeggie> Next Evo is how much damage you need to do to upgrade to the next armor level
[3:00:22] <SociallyAwkwardToaster> PAT
[3:00:24] <%Ynkubus_> Next Evo is the Meltyblood in a nuclear bunker
[3:00:26] <%AlteisenReiseZ> I'm surprised, I thought pat would be a Gibraltar guy
[3:00:29] <%BoxNavy> apology NOT accepted jermaSun
[3:00:36] <+RetroGiinthir> and you have by default, dont need shield first
[3:00:36] <%Monkeyweed21> Get a car @PatStaresAt
[3:00:41] <%sleepers1mulant> LUL
[3:00:43] <%SirKeigan> It's fine, the ring doesn't move fast and the first round doesn't hurt
[3:00:45] <yourliteraldog> Evo is in prison Evo is not going to last long on the yard
[3:00:45] <@SSaryn> Ye
[3:00:46] <%logoth_> Yes there's cars
[3:00:47] <TigerClaws12> bangalore barks LUL
[3:00:49] <Lolcola34> Oh yeah bloodhound can use the scan towers to see the next map location
[3:00:52] <+ThomasOfTroy> This map yes
[3:00:52] <MyNameIsRasus> THEY DRIVE NOW??
[3:00:55] <%barrakuta371> Cars were added this season
[3:00:55] <+ShadowForceX75> only on this map
[3:00:55] <+Das_Prints> Bloodhound is so damn good now.
[3:00:56] <@SSaryn> Just added this season for this map.
[3:00:59] <%SirKeigan> You sound so fucking out of touch it's hilarious
[3:01:01] <+Big_Gay_Skeleton> it's basically the ghost from halo
[3:01:01] <%SirKeigan> Maybe watch a video or two
[3:01:03] <+Fynale> they just added them
[3:01:09] <%Agami23> imagine if instead of cars it was titans
[3:01:12] <%BoxNavy> thank them jermaSun
[3:01:13] <%SirKeigan> Drives like a Warthog kinda
[3:01:15] <%Monkeyweed21> Bloodhound can now use map beacons too
[3:01:22] <dots4eyes> I checked out for a bit...is he playing with a squad or randos?
[3:01:22] <%SirKeigan> It's informative, not fun
[3:01:23] <+duskrush> I think solo, characters like Lifeline would suffer
[3:01:24] <%logoth_> oh nice ammo
[3:01:25] <+Fynale> i tried the turret girl on the car and it was hilariously hard to aim
[3:01:26] <T_Sasquatch> Bloodhound has always been good
[3:01:30] <%SirKeigan> Randos
[3:01:31] <+Das_Prints> It‚Äôs worth noting you can‚Äôt run people over with cars. Also the cars can‚Äôt be destroyed but if it gets shot the damage dealt his split evenly between all passengers.
[3:01:32] <+someguy1472> It's like tanking a new dungeon in 14, just do it.
[3:01:39] <+someguy1472> Way more fun.
[3:01:39] <@SSaryn> Also if it wasn't already apparent, to twist the knife even more, this was original a Titanfall 3 concept map.
[3:01:39] <+Big_Gay_Skeleton> TBH the most fun in TiF2 is pilots v pilots
[3:01:41] <dots4eyes> Thanks.
[3:01:45] <+Big_Gay_Skeleton> so i just want them to add a tdm mode to this game
[3:01:45] <%OrangeMDT> I don't think pat means to, but his questions keep sounding like he's confused about stuff and is shocked the game isn't explaining season's old content
[3:01:47] <%logoth_> Bloodhounds problem is that his head hitbox is funko pop like
[3:01:47] <Saltmeisterr> ok what the heck does Horizon do?
[3:01:48] <%sleepers1mulant> Nah throw yourself into the fire and learn as you go
[3:01:52] <corncob333> not feeling Ghostrunner?
[3:01:55] <Saltmeisterr> ive seen nothing of her
[3:02:03] <%SirKeigan> @OrangeMDT it's cuz he hasn't played the game in over a year
[3:02:06] <%ssjklyco> Who comes to PSA for good gameplay?
[3:02:08] <%SirKeigan> A lot's changed
[3:02:10] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Pat should probably hit the range for a few too
[3:02:16] <+Big_Gay_Skeleton> horizon has increased airstrafe speed, a grav lift, and a black hole ultimate
[3:02:22] <%SirKeigan> But he also asked what a syringe is so I think he forgot a few things LUL
[3:02:25] <+Das_Prints> This game is so fun once it clicks.
[3:02:26] <@SSaryn> Fucking love Horizon
[3:02:31] <@SSaryn> Shes my new main
[3:02:35] <%sleepers1mulant> @patstaresat if you fall off the map you get airdropped again
[3:02:36] <+duskrush> "Gonna do some looting here" Mmmmm
[3:02:38] <T_Sasquatch> @orangemdt realistically how do you learn over a year of patches and updates
[3:02:40] <Saltmeisterr> grav lift?
[3:02:41] <+duskrush> that line didn't age well
[3:02:46] <%SirKeigan> I won my first match with Horizon
[3:02:48] <Bloodninja15> Nah Pat's fine. Trial by fire
[3:02:49] <+someguy1472> How many dawns does this Horizen have?
[3:02:49] <@SSaryn> Ye
[3:02:50] <%koolaid_kevster> I love how pat pings evrythiong andd doesnt pick up half the stuff
[3:02:51] <+Big_Gay_Skeleton> I'd also say switch to keyboard and mouse if you can even sort of aim with a mouse since you can't move while looting
[3:02:55] <+MoroseLoki> PSA isn't he good at that one game with the buttons Kappa
[3:02:56] <%SirKeigan> *facepalm*
[3:02:58] <black_pariah> holy shit pat playing apex how did i miss this
[3:03:00] <%Monkeyweed21> the peacekeeper is the new special shotgun @PatStaresAt
[3:03:01] <+RootVeggie> The Mastiff fucking rips
[3:03:01] <%logoth_> Mastiff is now a regular weapon, but the Peacekeeper is now care package
[3:03:09] <%sleepers1mulant> YEAHHHHH
[3:03:12] <%SirKeigan> *clap* Pay *clap* Attention *clap*
[3:03:12] <+ThomasOfTroy> That box had a shotgun bolt
[3:03:12] <AlteisenReiseZ> As a gibby sub, Horizon players are my new best friends
[3:03:13] <dustyjordans> peacekeeper is in care package now
[3:03:15] <%barrakuta371> Nerfed mastiff, peacekeeper now new super shotgun
[3:03:15] <@SSaryn> They switched Legendries cause they realized Peacekeeper is fucking radical and way better.
[3:03:18] <Zebroneath> weapons go in and out of care package rotation
[3:03:21] <%Monkeyweed21> Peacekeeper is also a 2 shot
[3:03:23] <%NKOrange> Yea they swapped it with the peace
[3:03:28] <%BoxNavy> light ammo
[3:03:30] <%SirKeigan> Prowler is now a care package weapon
[3:03:33] <+Das_Prints> @t_sasquatch Biggest help is just learn what the items are so can loot quicker and keep up with your teammates. Legends you kind of have to learn as you go unless you have them unlocked.
[3:03:33] <SonicD4> i get so much of this game through osmosis because of SO
[3:03:36] <%cobalt_phoenix_> is mozambique still a meme
[3:03:39] <%logoth_> Prowler now is a care package weapon too
[3:03:45] <dustyjordans> light ammo here
[3:03:48] <%Monkeyweed21> Peacekeeper comes fully upgraded too
[3:03:53] <%SirKeigan> They also swapped the R-99 and Prowler
[3:03:53] <%barrakuta371> Prowler is now a care package weapon?!
[3:03:54] <@SSaryn> Mozambique is still slightly a meme but is a good early game weapon now.
[3:03:57] <%logoth_> Double tap trigger is shit
[3:03:57] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> hey chat or pat, did they ever add the epg?
[3:03:57] <+Big_Gay_Skeleton> Mozam is legit good if you find a hop up for it
[3:03:59] <@SSaryn> But upgrade it as soon as possible.
[3:04:02] <+Big_Gay_Skeleton> that makes it one shot with no shields
[3:04:05] <+MoroseLoki> I main Mozambique
[3:04:05] <ThisGuy198> they couldn't nerf the peacekeeper hard enough
[3:04:06] <%SirKeigan> H A M M E R P O I N T S
[3:04:10] <+Das_Prints> The Devotion was a care package weapon for a while and it was a beast.
[3:04:11] <%sleepers1mulant> they brought the r99 back out too
[3:04:12] <dustyjordans> prowler is also a care package gun now
[3:04:13] <%logoth_> dont forget your ult
[3:04:16] <%koolaid_kevster> HEY WENT TO THE CARE PACKAGE
[3:04:17] <%barrakuta371> No wonder why I couldn't find Prowler
[3:04:20] <%SirKeigan> He's already gone
[3:04:21] <%cobalt_phoenix_> cool
[3:04:24] <%SirKeigan> ha
[3:04:25] <%koolaid_kevster> where YOU pinged
[3:04:26] <black_pariah> i cant believe i missed 3 hours or pat's trademark griping

[3:04:48] <+GundamF91> 3080 putting in work
[3:04:48] <%sleepers1mulant> GIBBY WHY
[3:04:49] <%SirKeigan> You should play Lifeline for the heals
[3:04:51] <%SirKeigan> You like to revive
[3:04:56] <+VoxelFox51> I have noticed FPS has significantly declined
[3:04:57] <huskarl_zap> titanfall never dropped your framerate
[3:04:57] <SonicD4> one grenade
[3:04:58] <+i_heart_gaming> ULTIMATE
[3:05:03] <%SirKeigan> All three of you in this one spot. That's not good
[3:05:07] <%saadi90> That 3080 tho
[3:05:11] <huskarl_zap> was that blackbeard
[3:05:15] <TigerClaws12> LUL
[3:05:17] <@SSaryn> You tried
[3:05:18] <%SirKeigan> You're facing low level newbs so this shouldn't be too hard
[3:05:18] <%nahmercy> greedy
[3:05:22] <%SirKeigan> They're just standing there
[3:05:23] <+LordSDB> You tried!
[3:05:24] <+Das_Prints> Nice
[3:05:24] <%sleepers1mulant> NICE
[3:05:26] <%Monkeyweed21> Did you tho?
[3:05:27] <%AncelDeLambert> You... almost did it
[3:05:28] <+LordSDB> It was a good try!
[3:05:28] <%XeroSigmaPrime> And failed
[3:05:30] <swooty3000> Hay Pat Ho the not Titianfall
[3:05:31] <kryedge> that was actually really good
[3:05:32] <%OrangeMDT> that was some good recoil control tho
[3:05:32] <%BoxNavy> ohhh....
[3:05:34] <kryedge> GJ
[3:05:35] <%logoth_> This is some lobby
[3:05:38] <Bloodninja15> Shoulda healed
[3:05:40] <+i_heart_gaming> ITs all abouthaving fun
[3:05:42] <%barrakuta371> You got some good hits in tho
[3:05:46] <@SSaryn> No
[3:05:47] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Is this worse Titanfall 2?
[3:05:48] <%SirKeigan> You got some really good hits in though. Not joking
[3:05:48] <+Das_Prints> Did good damage though. This is good enough as a starting point after so long away.
[3:05:49] <%BoxNavy> now you must spectate
[3:05:53] <kryedge> shame
[3:05:57] <%SirKeigan> It's the spitifre guys, recoil is nothing
[3:06:01] <%NKOrange> Oh yea these are them early lobbies
[3:06:01] <%MelBrooksKA> no
[3:06:03] <@SSaryn> No Pat stop the KB+M nerds will shove their RBG in your face
[3:06:06] <@SSaryn> Kappa
[3:06:06] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> i'd try apex again if they added titanfall movement
[3:06:07] <%ssjklyco> Controllers are optimal
[3:06:10] <%OrangeMDT> I shouldn't have complimented him
[3:06:14] <SociallyAwkwardToaster> oh no is your teammate going INSIDE the ring to revive you
[3:06:16] <%barrakuta371> Back in!
[3:06:21] <%DakotaMacDoodle> Wow, we really are the Apex Legends season seven huh?
[3:06:26] <ThisGuy198> hipfire is good up close ntw

[3:06:41] <+Das_Prints> @beatboxersdevmike They did for this years Halloween event. You would respawn as a shadow that could double jump and wall run but only melee.

[3:08:12] <%SirKeigan> you never did
[3:08:12] <+Das_Prints> @beatboxersdevmike Yeah it was a fun time. Basically if you died you could keep respawning as that shadow until all your living teammates died. Led to some fun plays.

[3:10:17] <%OrangeMDT> yeah, pat would've been fucked last season
[3:10:19] <Vengie14> Excuse me why is Pat not amazing at the game he doesn't play
[3:10:20] <%logoth_> at the red ping
[3:10:21] <%SirKeigan> Put your gun away when you run
[3:10:27] <%SirKeigan> And slide every five setps
[3:10:28] <@SSaryn> @maenos2 Overall thought it was fine but also just has stuff he didn't like. At least that's what it felt like.
[3:10:28] <%SirKeigan> steps*
[3:10:35] <swooty3000> is it just me but why the stream 480p?
[3:10:46] <%logoth_> cover is important

[3:10:53] <TigerClaws12> spraying in the open
[3:10:54] <SonicD4> you have ad block on swooty
[3:10:58] <+Gamefriendly> hey why did Pat want to play Apex
[3:10:59] <masterfire23> @swooty3000 ad block

[3:11:10] <%maenos2> @Ssaryn ahh gotcha. All good, was curious about it but I've been watching Hamilton all night with a friend until now
[3:11:11] <T_Sasquatch> Lmaooooooo
[3:11:16] <T_Sasquatch> That's hilarious
[3:11:17] <%BoxNavy> theres a ublock script to get around it
[3:11:17] <Aydarkzero> is Pat doing solo or he has a group?
[3:11:19] <%TheWinged7> im using adblock and getting 1080 60 just fine
[3:11:19] <Dwarven_Gaming> woooow
[3:11:21] <mor3gan> well maybe if they didn't have random ads that ruin hype moments
[3:11:22] <%maenos2> so I just tuned in and its apex not ghostrunner and was confused
[3:11:22] <kesler031> some adblock still works
[3:11:25] <Dwarven_Gaming> Seriously?
[3:11:25] <@SoFarFetched> yeah some people who were using uBlock are stuck at 480p

[3:12:09] <+Das_Prints> Gold armor changed from fast healing to shield cells and syringes healing double what they usually do.
[3:12:10] <+el_machucapapas> should have slid

[3:12:56] <T_Sasquatch> Baby smoooth brain
[3:12:58] <%SomeSageAdvice> @cobalt_phoenix_ no, the resolution issue is occuring to those without the new ublock update/those who used a reddit post's advice to try to trick Twitch's system
[3:12:59] <Bloodninja15> Hope Bang wins
[3:13:00] <Profmcstevie> Twitch interrupting the very content it sells people on with ADS OF PRIME VIDEO, IT'S OWN COMPANYS PRODUCT is just hyper dumb barbKEK
[3:13:00] <%BoxNavy> treasure :)
[3:13:03] <+Samsquanch> twitch can suck my balls lol I'll watch a stream in 144p before giving into their adblock nonsense
[3:13:04] <@SSaryn> I'll be real I don't remember.
[3:13:05] <$StormingRLP> oh...oh god.
[3:13:06] <+Das_Prints> Run around and got a few kills. Was good.
[3:13:07] <%logoth_> Treasure pack is tied to a daily quest, get one a day until you get a special gun charm
[3:13:11] <DSD24> Bloodhound is the coolest
[3:13:12] <BlindBarghest> Still surprised his aim is so decent
[3:13:15] <$StormingRLP> Never thought pat would play Apex
[3:13:15] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @SomeSageAdvice ohhh ok
[3:13:17] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Hit the range, yo
[3:13:18] <%SirKeigan> It's for the comic

[3:13:27] <%Monkeyweed21> grapple tho
[3:13:29] <@SSaryn> Ah it's for comic shit so who cares.
[3:13:31] <huskarl_zap> Pat is probs a tone user
[3:13:32] <+discouragedoblong> Also birb
[3:13:33] <%sleepers1mulant> Apex is just losing games until you get teammates you click with and win
[3:13:35] <T_Sasquatch> Yes
[3:13:35] <DSD24> CAW
[3:13:37] <Saltmeisterr> turret lady seems cool

[3:13:41] <%YakumoYomi> Bird Up
[3:13:42] <@SoFarFetched> Im cool for a bird.
[3:13:44] <@SSaryn> EYYYYYYYYY
[3:13:45] <%BoxNavy> i thought you hated birds? they are cool though
[3:13:46] <%SomeSageAdvice> @Samsquanch give uninstalling then reinstalling UBlock a shot, they just updated it and it should clear everything out that is causing an issue
[3:13:47] <GPAlpha> Scorch rules
[3:13:48] <+i_heart_gaming> that is not a bird
[3:13:49] <DSD24> Scorch was the sickest!

[3:13:55] <%SirKeigan> he bird is JONTRON
[3:13:58] <%barrakuta371> Octane is fun too
[3:13:59] <DSD24> Burn em
[3:14:00] <%logoth_> Cool skin
[3:14:01] <+discouragedoblong> Duos is the best when you get someone who's ridiculously good at he game
[3:14:02] <%Tman451> legion gang
[3:14:02] <pelonsinvalle> northstar gang rise up
[3:14:04] <%sleepers1mulant> RONIN
[3:14:05] <masterfire23> laughs in ronin
[3:14:05] <yourliteraldog> Use tone
[3:14:08] <+nvrwr> Daddy scorch
[3:14:12] <+Das_Prints> @saltmeisterr she‚Äôs a bit low tier meta wise but she‚Äôs super fun. Been playing her for most of this season to good effect.
[3:14:14] <%SirKeigan> This should be better
[3:14:17] <huskarl_zap> Ronin gang swords for sale
[3:14:17] <T_Sasquatch> Mada mada
[3:14:20] <SociallyAwkwardToaster> Pat, if you select your hero instead of letting it select bloodhound for you it makes you jumpmaster
[3:14:22] <%sleepers1mulant> monarch too
[3:14:27] <+ThomasOfTroy> Bloodhound's ability is nice with bangalore's smoke
[3:14:27] <ThisGuy198> Papa Scorch PogChamp
[3:14:29] <%SirKeigan> yea don't use 3x or higher
[3:14:31] <%GarbageNirvana> Season pass on this game still fucked?
[3:14:34] <+Deko_> damn this map looks different
[3:14:45] <%SirKeigan> 3x is too much
[3:14:53] <yourliteraldog> Scorch is for mouth breathers
[3:14:54] <%logoth_> 3x is what I use as a sniper scope in a pinch
[3:14:57] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Save 3x for ARs like the Hemlok or snipers
[3:14:57] <@SSaryn> 2x-1x/2x is always better in my opinion but 3x has its' place.
[3:14:58] <%SirKeigan> it's a medium range sniper scope and nothing else as far I'm concerned
[3:15:07] <%NKOrange> 2x bruisers are a great choice all around
[3:15:11] <huskarl_zap> Because their noses are scorched
[3:15:11] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Yes
[3:15:12] <DSD24> That's a terrible opinion
[3:15:12] <%logoth_> Mozambique has 4 bullets now
[3:15:12] <huskarl_zap> also no
[3:15:13] <GPAlpha> Moz has 4 shots now
[3:15:13] <%cobalt_phoenix_> *heavy breathing*
[3:15:13] <@SSaryn> Sounds like someone got Fire Caged a little too many times Kappa
[3:15:14] <%SirKeigan> time to be a loot goblin
[3:15:14] <+ThomasOfTroy> No
[3:15:15] <T_Sasquatch> It looks like a map and not an ugly piece of shit like the first map
[3:15:15] <%sleepers1mulant> 2x is the only good one
[3:15:16] <SociallyAwkwardToaster> eh not really
[3:15:16] <%SirKeigan> yea, hammerpoint rounds
[3:15:17] <+chvmpchange> sickest burns
[3:15:17] <SonicD4> you asked before and yes?
[3:15:18] <+Das_Prints> If you let the character select timer time out it will usually pass jumpmaster to the next player.
[3:15:18] <SGrim> God no
[3:15:18] <%koolaid_kevster> thweye gave it a hop up
[3:15:19] <+RootVeggie> Ion mains represent
[3:15:19] <@SSaryn> It's SLIGHTLY better.
[3:15:22] <%barrakuta371> They kinda fixed it
[3:15:23] <DSD24> Who talks shit about Scorch?
[3:15:23] <+valentinostand> its legit now more so with the buff
[3:15:24] <Lolcola34> get hammerpoint round hopup and its awsome
[3:15:27] <%SirKeigan> too slow
[3:15:28] <critfumble_> yes the hop up makes it a monster
[3:15:30] <%logoth_> Also, the mozam can have an attachment that SHREDDS health
[3:15:30] <masterfire23> what's there to fix it's already perfect
[3:15:30] <%Taisuru> It is usable now
[3:15:31] <%Mrbaconator> mozambique here
[3:15:33] <+chvmpchange> ion was pretty sick
[3:15:33] <+RetroGiinthir> 4 shots can knock down
[3:15:34] <+JimmyRuss> Moza is pretty good now with 4 shots and hammerpoints
[3:15:36] <+ShadowForceX75> yes! I like it, you gotta hit the shots but it does more damage
[3:15:36] <DSD24> He's low tier compared to other Titans
[3:15:37] <Zebroneath> Mozambique has a hop-up that doubles "health" damage
[3:15:38] <ThisGuy198> 2x is the highest you should go on non snipers\
[3:15:38] <%NKOrange> ? Fix
[3:15:41] <%OrangeMDT> I mean it's meant to be a bad common weapon
[3:15:42] <Saltmeisterr> yes
[3:15:42] <+zee_generate> yes i breathe from my mouth hole, what of it?
[3:15:42] <%SirKeigan> Yea
[3:15:42] <+Das_Prints> They added a hop up that lets it one shot people who have no armor and it has 4 shots.
[3:15:46] <@SSaryn> It's still an upgrade as quickly as possible but its' still a take and yeah if you get the hop up it's pretty alright.
[3:15:46] <huskarl_zap> Gotta go fast
[3:15:48] <Saltmeisterr> he spheed boi
[3:15:49] <%SirKeigan> He is that character
[3:15:54] <%SirKeigan> He did it too
[3:15:55] <%NKOrange> I mean it has a buff to ammo and a new attachment
[3:15:56] <%cobalt_phoenix_> S P E E D
[3:15:57] <dustyjordans> he stim
[3:15:57] <@SoFarFetched> D:
[3:15:57] <%logoth_> He's based off a speedrunner who did a really fast obstacle course run by using grenades
[3:15:57] <huskarl_zap> looks like a mass effect character
[3:16:00] <Saltmeisterr> based of a speedrunner for titanfall
[3:16:02] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Yes
[3:16:02] <%SirKeigan> Nope
[3:16:03] <+Gannondaddy> 20 i think
[3:16:04] <+discouragedoblong> he has a really cool gun skin too
[3:16:05] <%SirKeigan> $20
[3:16:07] <fuchard1996> that mean he good!
[3:16:09] <%sleepers1mulant> He fast boi
[3:16:11] <%barrakuta371> Octane did blow up his legs to get a faster score time
[3:16:11] <dustyjordans> he grenade jumped doing the gauntlet and blew his legs off
[3:16:14] <@SSaryn> Listen
[3:16:15] <yourliteraldog> yes
[3:16:16] <GPAlpha> Pat, Octane has TF Stim as an ability
[3:16:16] <@SSaryn> He paid for it
[3:16:18] <marvel877> How long has Pat been playing Apex tonight?
[3:16:20] <%cobalt_phoenix_> the one in titanfall is just a robot, this guy removed his legs i think
[3:16:20] <+Das_Prints> He is the Stim ability basically from Titanfall.
[3:16:26] <yourliteraldog> He is based of the stim kit
[3:16:26] <%SirKeigan> just go find loot for fuck's sake lol
[3:16:28] <%NKOrange> Yup
[3:16:29] <huskarl_zap> He ran to that mountain and back
[3:16:33] <%SirKeigan> look for a big building
[3:16:33] <+Das_Prints> That skin is from one of the special editions.
[3:16:35] <%luftraumm1> are they moving into a direction of more stylization and modern weapons and context?
[3:16:37] <amonimis> !uptime
[3:16:37] <@SSaryn> Definitely how that works
[3:16:37] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 16m.
[3:16:39] <%Taisuru> Yes
[3:16:39] <%logoth_> On yeah and the hemlock is really good now
[3:16:40] <%cobalt_phoenix_> yes
[3:16:43] <%SirKeigan> yes
[3:16:44] <%Ner234> Money = Power
[3:16:44] <%SirKeigan> pick that u
[3:16:52] <%Taisuru> SKins > Skills
[3:16:56] <+discouragedoblong> He lifts his legs high like Joker
[3:16:58] <%SirKeigan> up
[3:16:59] <yourliteraldog> Every character in this game is diffrent titan fall load out.
[3:17:01] <@SSaryn> He big fast
[3:17:02] <%SirKeigan> too slow
[3:17:09] <%SirKeigan> take that
[3:17:09] <+POUND_CAKE94> Moral of the story: do drugs
[3:17:11] <%SirKeigan> get a sope tho
[3:17:13] <huskarl_zap> Man stim kit is so weird isnt he a robot?
[3:17:14] <%logoth_> Triple take also shoots super rapidly now
[3:17:19] <yourliteraldog> Yeah that makes sense
[3:17:20] <+Das_Prints> His ult is he throws jump pads.
[3:17:25] <+Deko_> LUL
[3:17:25] <+POUND_CAKE94> PUNCH IT
[3:17:27] <%Taisuru> LUL
[3:17:28] <+glgzephyr> Imagine playing on steam with a controller O_O
[3:17:30] <%SirKeigan> KILL ALL MRVNS
[3:17:33] <+discouragedoblong> PAWNCH
[3:17:34] <pelonsinvalle> MRVN
[3:17:46] <%SirKeigan> Snipor
[3:17:50] <+Parlsain> Dude runs like he's shit his pants like Johnny from MGS.
[3:17:52] <yourliteraldog> MRVN did nothing wrong
[3:17:55] <+Das_Prints> Ooh never knew there was a MRVN on the map.
[3:17:58] <@SSaryn> Crazy Talk continues LUL
[3:17:58] <+Deko_> PogChamp
[3:17:59] <+POUND_CAKE94> noice
[3:18:06] <critfumble_> jesus that aim assist lmao
[3:18:07] <%SirKeigan> Good rule of thumb: If you're teammate is looting an area, don't loot the same area
[3:18:08] <BlindBarghest> Dang pat
[3:18:13] <+chvmpchange> fuckin hate those ironsights
[3:18:14] <%sleepers1mulant> Nice
[3:18:15] <GPAlpha> Weaponized Crazy Talk?
[3:18:15] <+POUND_CAKE94> He got em you're good pat
[3:18:16] <+discouragedoblong> SILENT
[3:18:20] <%ssjklyco> Controller won the battle
[3:18:23] <+POUND_CAKE94> The other is dead lmaoooo
[3:18:26] <+discouragedoblong> take the holo pls
[3:18:28] <%sleepers1mulant> Ulti
[3:18:28] <%SirKeigan> If it's not greyed out it means you need it
[3:18:37] <%SirKeigan> get ridd of the light ammo you don't need
[3:18:43] <%Taisuru> Oh, I'm assuming Lifeline got nerfed since way back, could anyone tell me how?
[3:18:56] <%SirKeigan> Lifeline lost her quick heals
[3:18:59] <%SirKeigan> But she got a better revive
[3:19:04] <yourliteraldog> Being a junkie is cool
[3:19:08] <+discouragedoblong> Hert drone heals people now
[3:19:10] <%AlteisenReiseZ> ^^
[3:19:12] <+POUND_CAKE94> Her revive is stupid
[3:19:12] <Chumblago13> But has drone revive plus shield
[3:19:14] <+discouragedoblong> Revives
[3:19:16] <%SirKeigan> And I heard quick heals are coming back in a datamine
[3:19:17] <+jt427> also her bot dies to storm damage
[3:19:22] <+glgzephyr> is this two man queue?
[3:19:23] <+Das_Prints> @taisuru They got rid of her fast heal but she can now Rez people with her robot automatically while she is free to shoot.
[3:19:27] <%Taisuru> Does she still create insane equipment for free?
[3:19:28] <IntenseNerdRage> this stream is already bad because we havent heard a racial slur for the past 10 seconds
[3:19:31] <%SirKeigan> Yea, dos
[3:19:32] <IntenseNerdRage> this game is bad
[3:19:33] <@SSaryn> @glgzephyr Duos do indeed exist now.
[3:19:34] <+POUND_CAKE94> ya he's in duos
[3:19:38] <%SirKeigan> Use the flatline it's better
[3:19:40] <+glgzephyr> nice
[3:19:43] <+Das_Prints> She‚Äôs pretty good. Just less self sufficient due to no fast heals.
[3:19:44] <+discouragedoblong> Its barly a nerf imo
[3:19:45] <Chumblago13> @taisuru no
[3:19:46] <%luftraumm1> wait is pat playing on gamepad?
[3:19:50] <yourliteraldog> He muted chat
[3:19:53] <%AlteisenReiseZ> I still think pat should hit the range
[3:19:53] <ThisGuy198> when you scan the enemy can see it for like half a mile away
[3:19:56] <huskarl_zap> Does anyone here like the vr levels from tf2 cuz I don't
[3:19:57] <+glgzephyr> I feel like Duos is what I was waiting for with this game
[3:19:58] <+discouragedoblong> Pay always plays on gamepad
[3:20:02] <+Das_Prints> @taisuru Yes. They even buffed how much healing items her care package gives a while ago.
[3:20:02] <+glgzephyr> I might give it another hsot
[3:20:03] <%SirKeigan> Always has been
[3:20:07] <@SSaryn> Flatline got pretty sizable shit.
[3:20:09] <+POUND_CAKE94> FLATLINE DOESNT GET 50 SHOTS
[3:20:11] <critfumble_> different use cases
[3:20:16] <%OrangeMDT> for ttk yeah
[3:20:19] <Smitteys867> Pat playing more apex? Never thought id see the day
[3:20:22] <%SirKeigan> Noobs use guns that you don't have to reload
[3:20:23] <@SSaryn> Spitfire is still my go to but Flatline is still gud
[3:20:27] <%ssjklyco> yoink
[3:20:30] <%Taisuru> LUL THIS GUY
[3:20:33] <%SirKeigan> Oh yea, just hold down the trigger and hope enough bullets hit LUL
[3:20:34] <+Das_Prints> Flat line has better fire rate and more damage per shot. Spitfire gets better mag size.
[3:20:34] <+RootVeggie> Spitfire is better if you play Rampart lady
[3:20:37] <@SSaryn> CAUSE HE FAST
[3:20:37] <critfumble_> flatline hits like a truck but spitfire hands in there better mid range
[3:20:38] <+glgzephyr> Pat is baby
[3:20:38] <%sleepers1mulant> It‚Äôs honestly preference
[3:20:39] <%SirKeigan> Flatline is more accurate
[3:20:40] <%ssjklyco> Cause he paid money for it
[3:20:44] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> no the clip is still in the gun
[3:20:48] <+Deepfriedcthulhu> Deepfriedcthulhu subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! 
[3:20:48] <+discouragedoblong> Cause he's better
[3:20:49] <+lordericter> I mean you did say he's better so might as well give him the ammo
[3:20:49] <%Taisuru> One kill gj pat
[3:20:51] <dustyjordans> because octanes are toxic
[3:20:53] <dustyjordans> always
[3:20:55] <%cobalt_phoenix_> does this game have the CAR in it or no?
[3:20:56] <%SirKeigan> Bigger mag isn't everything, it's how you use it LUL
[3:21:02] <+POUND_CAKE94> oh totally forgot about Rampart's heavy wpn passive wow
[3:21:06] <+Das_Prints> Rip MRVN
[3:21:08] <%SirKeigan> We got the Volt instead of the CAR
[3:21:09] <%AlteisenReiseZ> If Pat likes the spitfire, he should play rampart
[3:21:10] <ThisGuy198> Spitfire is the better noob gun but flat is overall better imo
[3:21:14] <Smitteys867> @PatStaresAt Bloodhounds scan goes in a cone in front of them, fyi
[3:21:16] <critfumble_> CAR isn't in yet they added the volt last season
[3:21:17] <+POUND_CAKE94> Bigger mag isnt everything u right
[3:21:18] <+glgzephyr> he is very fast
[3:21:19] <%sleepers1mulant> Ramparts passive is great
[3:21:19] <+discouragedoblong> HE RUNS LIEK THE JOKER
[3:21:21] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Your clip is still in spitefire
[3:21:21] <@SSaryn> Octane's living is life dude
[3:21:22] <%OrangeMDT> Pat WILL keep the light ammo
[3:21:24] <yourliteraldog> he is playing a speed addict so it tracks
[3:21:30] <+Das_Prints> The Spitfire is really good using Rampart‚Äôs passive. It‚Äôs just alright outside of that.
[3:21:30] <@SSaryn> Only with sprint boost.
[3:21:31] <%SirKeigan> No
[3:21:31] <BlindBarghest> The rare octane that isn't running randomly into battle
[3:21:34] <%ssjklyco> You were out running him
[3:21:36] <%SirKeigan> But if you put your guns away you run faster
[3:21:41] <%barrakuta371> If he uses his sprint boost yes
[3:21:43] <@SSaryn> With his ability yeah
[3:21:46] <dustyjordans> base run speed is the same
[3:21:47] <Zebroneath> he has stim from Titanfall. Not as powerful, though
[3:21:48] <%OrangeMDT> oh shit, I was wrong
[3:21:56] <%barrakuta371> He also has a slow heal when out of combat
[3:22:01] <@SSaryn> It's Stim from TF2 that takes 10 health.
[3:22:04] <%sleepers1mulant> But sprint boost costs health
[3:22:08] <+Das_Prints> All characters sprint and walk the same speed. Octane moves 40% faster if he uses his stim though.
[3:22:08] <+POUND_CAKE94> Does Pat ever stow his guns? Does he know it's a thing? Does it matter?
[3:22:09] <%sleepers1mulant> But he has passive regen
[3:22:11] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Octanes I can stand. It's the Wraiths who leave after getting dropped for half a second that piss me off
[3:22:15] <%NKOrange> Also light self heal over time
[3:22:18] <+demon1103> hes a junkie who keeps sticking himself with needles....watch your back Pat XD
[3:22:19] <%SirKeigan> You should check out the Olympus Preview mode. You get to explore and loot without worrying about dying. Just try things out and see what's what
[3:22:26] <%barrakuta371> Pat Ring
[3:22:28] <+POUND_CAKE94> Self heal buff nasty
[3:22:42] <Saltmeisterr> he ZOOMIN
[3:22:44] <@SSaryn> Ye it's Stim from TF2 but takes health, but he regens health.
[3:22:51] <%SirKeigan> Octane heals twice as fast now
[3:22:54] <Smitteys867> Run faster with your knife out!
[3:22:55] <+glgzephyr> they're inside the ring
[3:22:57] <%SirKeigan> I'm curious, is it as fast as lifeline's drone heal
[3:23:02] <%sleepers1mulant> He nyoom
[3:23:06] <+Das_Prints> Stim is 40% faster.
[3:23:13] <+discouragedoblong> PAY BLIND
[3:23:14] <huskarl_zap> pat did you not see them?
[3:23:15] <+discouragedoblong> PAT
[3:23:16] <IntenseNerdRage> no @sirkeigan
[3:23:18] <+RetroGiinthir> Speed boost costs health, but he also regenerates it
[3:23:20] <huskarl_zap> he didny
[3:23:23] <scrumbotime> HE DIDN'T SEE?
[3:23:24] <+discouragedoblong> Pat is actually blind confirmed
[3:23:25] <+chvmpchange> what is the button for putting your gun away on controller?
[3:23:34] <+POUND_CAKE94> L Star pog

[3:23:58] <%NKOrange> At that range just hip fire
[3:23:59] <ninjaguiden> So is this game fun? I'm kind of getting hungry for FPS right now...

[3:24:05] <%Mrbaconator> YOU DON'T PAY HIS SUB
[3:24:06] <+POUND_CAKE94> It means he knows he's carrying
[3:24:07] <%Fooguwu> cold, but fair
[3:24:07] <%Jekado> he's helping alright... helping himself to the LOOT!
[3:24:08] <dustyjordans> OCTANES ARE TOXIC
[3:24:09] <%Dakuu75> that's a dick move, lol
[3:24:09] <+glgzephyr> well yeah, did you kill that squad or did he?
[3:24:11] <%luftraumm1> he right
[3:24:13] <+ShadowForceX75> that's how Mafia work
[3:24:16] <MasterTonberry23> @ninjaguiden well its free, so you can go decide for yourself
[3:24:17] <%sleepers1mulant> HE EARNED IT
[3:24:17] <redial_nick> you would do that
[3:24:20] <BlindBarghest> I mean. Put the mask on yourself before the baby right?
[3:24:21] <ThisGuy198> oooh so he's one of DOES, huh?
[3:24:24] <%MechArch> it's the price pat
[3:24:26] <%Piemono> You would do it too though
[3:24:28] <%Fooguwu> you can have loot when you survive combat
[3:24:28] <%SirKeigan> I had someone let me bleed out because they said I took all the heals and died even though I did a ton of damage on the enemies. I just quit out. Don't need that toxicity
[3:24:30] <MasterTonberry23> never would have thought pat would come back to this game, but there you go
[3:24:37] <yourliteraldog> good guy
[3:24:39] <Robert_Eccles> Just don't rez him when he gets downed
[3:24:39] <ThisGuy198> heal pat
[3:24:45] <Profmcstevie> Heal up and get your shit together ssjFresh
[3:24:51] <%SirKeigan> Stupid Wraith went out of their way to loot every single body, go to heal me, and then cancel it. Fucking prick
[3:24:53] <+POUND_CAKE94> It took some Twitter convincing to get him back
[3:24:53] <GPAlpha> Don't forget grenades
[3:24:57] <+discouragedoblong> So pat is blind and colorblind?
[3:24:58] <%Taisuru> Wow they really nerfed heal speed on that med kit since I played
[3:24:58] <yourliteraldog> Sonic X
[3:25:02] <%barrakuta371> Go, your people need you
[3:25:04] <huskarl_zap> I wonder if that octane is amilia cuz she toxic as f
[3:25:06] <+glgzephyr> you're about to get lit up
[3:25:08] <%SirKeigan> PUT YOUR GUN AWAY
[3:25:09] <%SirKeigan> RUN FASTER
[3:25:09] <IntenseNerdRage> Pat if you dont win, that means your bad
[3:25:11] <ninjaguiden> @MasterTonberry23 I will then! Last FPS is played was BF3 lol
[3:25:13] <%SirKeigan> thank you
[3:25:24] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Imagine having a character with wallhacks and not seeing where people are LUL
[3:25:29] <MasterTonberry23> @ninjaguiden get the steam version because f origin
[3:25:30] <DSD24> You run faster with your knife out
[3:25:31] <+Das_Prints> @taisuru They haven‚Äôt touched the medkit speed.
[3:25:33] <black_mages_matter_> oh when did they give longbow unique ammo?
[3:25:38] <%SirKeigan> They're too far away
[3:25:40] <%sleepers1mulant> ULT
[3:25:41] <+POUND_CAKE94> Found out you can mount the Rampart gun to the speeders on this map
[3:25:50] <ninjaguiden> @MasterTonberry23 Oh yeah, that thing RUINED BF for me almost
[3:25:51] <%AlteisenReiseZ> @black_mages_matter_ Season 3
[3:25:52] <@SSaryn> @black_mages_matter_ Not unique, they just made a Sniper class of weapons.
[3:25:52] <%SirKeigan> You hear gunfire? Go after it
[3:25:55] <%SirKeigan> Kill baddies
[3:26:07] <huskarl_zap> what gods?
[3:26:08] <+POUND_CAKE94> Bloodhound is best ye
[3:26:09] <IntenseNerdRage> Pat dont die
[3:26:13] <+Das_Prints> @taisuru They did get rid of faster healing speeds on Lifeline and Gold armor though. Using healing items in Gibraltar‚Äôs dome makes you heal quicker though.
[3:26:17] <@SSaryn> I'd argue Horizon but hey
[3:26:20] <%sleepers1mulant> Third team everyone
[3:26:20] <black_mages_matter_> @AlteisenReiseZ dang how long ago was that? i havent played since the first month
[3:26:32] <%sleepers1mulant> No Rampart is the best
[3:26:33] <+glgzephyr> hey thanks, controller!
[3:26:35] <+POUND_CAKE94> Your tactical recharges faster in ULT
[3:26:37] <%SirKeigan> SSaryn's got a hot crush on Horizon
[3:26:41] <huskarl_zap> What if BT came back and was like "Praise the gods"
[3:26:42] <+Das_Prints> Bloodhound is legit solid these days despite being one of the weaker legends for months.
[3:26:47] <+POUND_CAKE94> gg
[3:26:53] <@SSaryn> Horizons great I won't deny
[3:26:53] <%barrakuta371> You did good kid
[3:26:54] <%SirKeigan> You can't just stand there and shoot
[3:26:56] <%SirKeigan> You need to move around
[3:26:57] <+Kalabroun> gg
[3:27:00] <ThisGuy198> oof gg nt
[3:27:00] <%Taisuru> @Das_Prints Ah, I see. TBF I didn't play A TON, got one win and bopped :V
[3:27:01] <+lordericter> oh no the stumbo occurred

[3:27:06] <@SSaryn> Top 10 at least
[3:27:10] <%luftraumm1> serpentine
[3:27:11] <+ShadowForceX75> pat what do you think of the character horizon?
[3:27:12] <dustyjordans> gg
[3:27:12] <+glgzephyr> @SirKeigan he was moving, just slowly because ADS
[3:27:14] <@SSaryn> Oh hey Top 5
[3:27:16] <Noogiez> your guy looks like a safari guide
[3:27:18] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> is the stream dropping for anyone else?
[3:27:19] <%sleepers1mulant> Nice job though
[3:27:19] <+Deko_> top 5 lol
[3:27:21] <superbla25> did he actually pop ult that round?
[3:27:22] <+POUND_CAKE94> Tactical has 7 sec recharge in Ult right?
[3:27:23] <@SSaryn> Ye
[3:27:25] <%SirKeigan> Try the preview event
[3:27:26] <%sleepers1mulant> This game is all practice
[3:27:28] <IntenseNerdRage> Because Pat lost we have to call him a whole bunch of names
[3:27:32] <%barrakuta371> You are the proest Apex gamer man
[3:27:32] <+glgzephyr> @superbla25 nope
[3:27:32] <%luftraumm1> bloodhound is ugly AF
[3:27:33] <+POUND_CAKE94> Agreed
[3:27:33] <+Das_Prints> @taisuru No worries dude. Congrats on getting a win!
[3:27:35] <%ssjklyco> you can duo it
[3:27:35] <critfumble_> if youve got no friends sure
[3:27:35] <%SirKeigan> YOU'RE WELCOME
[3:27:37] <%barrakuta371> I like Duos
[3:27:41] <+POUND_CAKE94> Same with Rocket League
[3:27:44] <BlindBarghest> Always good to have a bloodhound on the team these days
[3:27:45] <+lordericter> what's wrong with Trios?
[3:27:51] <+Deko_> crossplay means between pc and consoles or steam-origin?
[3:27:55] <critfumble_> crazy talk
[3:28:00] <dustyjordans> feels like duos is a lot sweatier too
[3:28:01] <ninjaguiden> What's the max squad size?
[3:28:08] <%DedlokPM> @Deko_ steam origin I think
[3:28:12] <dustyjordans> @ninjaguiden 3
[3:28:13] <+POUND_CAKE94> Trios was OD during the Halloween event that just happened
[3:28:15] <%Dakuu75> flip a coin and pick one dude
[3:28:20] <IntenseNerdRage> Pat who cares, just kill people
[3:28:26] <+Soulsbjorne> genius
[3:28:28] <yourliteraldog> less people
[3:28:32] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Wraith psaDown
[3:28:35] <+el_machucapapas> Comm is key
[3:28:38] <critfumble_> or play with your friends
[3:28:45] <@SSaryn> Wraith's Naruto Run RIP BibleThump
[3:28:48] <+nazzynoeyes> @Deko_ It's console/pc
[3:28:49] <+Das_Prints> @deko_ Crossplay is between consoles and they can opt in to play against pc players. Pc players only play against pc players on origin and steam unless a console players opts in to play on of as well.
[3:28:50] <+POUND_CAKE94> Yupyup
[3:28:57] <%OrangeMDT> I mean, that's certainly a perspective
[3:29:04] <%SirKeigan> Duos is a really good edition. It's permanent
[3:29:08] <+POUND_CAKE94> Less mid-combat confusion too
[3:29:11] <Smitteys867> gamer time
[3:29:12] <Saltmeisterr> Ok what is up with wraith's naruto run?
[3:29:12] <%SirKeigan> Go to Elysium, like in the Matt Damon movie
[3:29:15] <+el_machucapapas> Naruto run is back actually
[3:29:18] <Saltmeisterr> i don't play this game
[3:29:20] <huskarl_zap> All these characters are degens even for the Apex predators.
[3:29:22] <GPAlpha> Pat "Hotdrop" Boivin
[3:29:26] <%SirKeigan> This entire map reminds me of the Elysium place
[3:29:29] <+glgzephyr> oh map knowledge
[3:29:38] <+POUND_CAKE94> Grenades and melee only?
[3:29:41] <%SirKeigan> Pro Tip: Get a gun before armor. You can't kill anyome with armor
[3:29:50] <+glgzephyr> wasn't havoc like the *first* gun they added?
[3:29:51] <Smitteys867> Havoc is good but it has to wind up
[3:29:53] <%sleepers1mulant> Ew a havoc
[3:30:03] <%SirKeigan> jump down
[3:30:04] <+Das_Prints> @sirkeigan You can punch them real good though.
[3:30:09] <+glgzephyr> he has a mastiff and he's using the havoc =(
[3:30:09] <dustyjordans> assault rifle, has wind up time
[3:30:13] <+POUND_CAKE94> Havoc is the most hot/cold weapon in the game for me
[3:30:15] <%luftraumm1> good
[3:30:16] <%SirKeigan> Already?!
[3:30:19] <+el_machucapapas> watch the recoil on havoc
[3:30:19] <+Das_Prints> @glgzephyr Yes it was.
[3:30:21] <%Dakuu75> fair try, fair try
[3:30:24] <%SirKeigan> Havoc got a new recoil pattern this season
[3:30:26] <black_mages_matter_> oh my god how did he lose that
[3:30:28] <theanora1> that gun sucked
[3:30:29] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Hit the range, kid
[3:30:30] <+lordericter> you sure did
[3:30:31] <%Taisuru> Hey, SOMEBODY has to die first
[3:30:31] <%ShineTheDiamond> Solid
[3:30:32] <%SirKeigan> Supposedly easier
[3:30:32] <Smitteys867> Block doors when you're knocked down
[3:30:32] <@SSaryn> You were the Jumpaster that was cool
[3:30:33] <%sleepers1mulant> Havoc is horrible
[3:30:34] <+POUND_CAKE94> NBD
[3:30:38] <+BionicPulga> platyFAIL
[3:30:39] <%SirKeigan> Yea
[3:30:39] <black_mages_matter_> you got that dude to HALF AND HE STILL LOST
[3:30:39] <chan_chan_revolution> It's alright everyone. I'm here now.
[3:30:41] <@SoFarFetched> So that was Apex Legends,chat Kappa
[3:30:43] <yourliteraldog> wasn't the havoc a grenade launch in titan fall
[3:30:46] <+POUND_CAKE94> would've lost anyway no sweat
[3:30:46] <%SirKeigan> You got a pack!
[3:30:46] <+glgzephyr> @black_mages_matter_ he didn't use the broken shotgun he picked up, so...
[3:30:48] <+xiccy> what happened to the robot parkour game?
[3:30:50] <yourliteraldog> good trade
[3:30:52] <MasterTonberry23> ah well, live and learn (hanging on the edge of tomorrow)
[3:30:53] <+Das_Prints> @black_mages_matter_ the havoc has a wind up period before it starts shooting and heavy recoil. But big damage.
[3:30:54] <yojohny> @PatStaresAt That was pretty bad huh?
[3:30:57] <critfumble_> havoc shreads but you have to learn it
[3:30:58] <%SirKeigan> Did you pay for the battlepass? It's only 10 bucks dude
[3:31:00] <nmaten> why play a competitive fps with controller?
[3:31:04] <+TheDreadedDreadKnot> Hi Pat!!! love you sinse 2012!!!!!
[3:31:10] <%Dakuu75> I'm looking at Rampart and Horizon right now... Rampart is soooo ugly lol
[3:31:10] <%SirKeigan> Yea there is
[3:31:13] <black_mages_matter_> @glgzephyr WAIT I JUST REGISTERED THAT WAS A MASTIFF IS THAT A NORMAL DROP NOW?
[3:31:18] <%SirKeigan> Oh, on console there is
[3:31:23] <automata93> There iss
[3:31:24] <+glgzephyr> I guess
[3:31:24] <Bloodninja15> There is
[3:31:27] <+glgzephyr> seems weird
[3:31:29] <%SirKeigan> So that's it, right?
[3:31:30] <+el_machucapapas> You mute your squad on select screen
[3:31:33] <yourliteraldog> quip
[3:31:37] <MasterTonberry23> really? odd, rogue company lets you fully mute voice chat
[3:31:40] <+POUND_CAKE94> I think because they want to encourage comms as much as possible
[3:31:44] <%Typhaeon> Oh well excuuuuse me
[3:31:46] <@SoFarFetched> Pat allows us to talk to him
[3:31:51] <+RetroGiinthir> There is on console

[3:31:57] <+RetroGiinthir> I‚Äôve used it
[3:31:57] <huskarl_zap> SHILLS
[3:31:57] <GPAlpha> Yeah, Mastiff is normal now
[3:31:58] <%Monkeyweed21> but you NEED to hear the crying baby
[3:32:00] <%Taisuru> Don't worry pat we'll talk to you for them
[3:32:01] <%Typhaeon> Watt Daughter more like
[3:32:05] <gps309> she is french

[3:32:14] <@SSaryn> Wattson a cool trap/defend character.
[3:32:16] <%SirKeigan> Try out Pathfinder
[3:32:17] <%YakumoYomi> Watson apparently doesn't play Watson
[3:32:19] <+Deko_> she cute
[3:32:19] <$ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots> Or, Watty Mandel, as I call them
[3:32:20] <Saltmeisterr> i like her tho
[3:32:20] <+POUND_CAKE94> Prowler is CP drop now yeah?
[3:32:27] <+Draco_Renegade> I think shes french too.
[3:32:29] <%sleepers1mulant> Wattson is great
[3:32:30] <huskarl_zap> >Trapcharacter LUL
[3:32:30] <+Das_Prints> She makes fences and her ult is a trophy system that helps shields.
[3:32:39] <@SSaryn> Rift but sure
[3:32:39] <%SirKeigan> If this Wattson is good you're going to play defensive this time
[3:32:40] <CasualAlohaFriday> She certainly doesn't look very much like Emma Watson.
[3:32:41] <+el_machucapapas> Gibby is husbando
[3:32:41] <+POUND_CAKE94> ye
[3:32:45] <$ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots> He's doing it, chat! doodGood
[3:32:51] <+Das_Prints> Heals* shields.

[3:35:23] <%YakumoYomi> Goddamnit, Pat
[3:35:25] <superbla25> uh...
[3:35:25] <huskarl_zap> no
[3:35:27] <%SirKeigan> Brothur
[3:35:30] <%sleepers1mulant> WutFace
[3:35:33] <%AlteisenReiseZ> @SSaryn Well this is a newbie lobby
[3:35:41] <%ssjklyco> Disc Room
[3:35:44] <+glgzephyr> yes
[3:35:44] <Profmcstevie> Pat single handlely solving world hunger by dropping SO much spaghetti
[3:35:45] <GPAlpha> That's her ability
[3:35:45] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Ame ground puonds
[3:35:45] <@SSaryn> Wattsons traps
[3:35:46] <Saltmeisterr> ye
[3:35:46] <%YakumoYomi> Of course she did. She's a gremlin!
[3:35:46] <BlueLunecy> Wattson makes those
[3:35:48] <ItIsSky> yeah
[3:35:48] <KriticalH1T> Sit on my face Kreygasm
[3:35:48] <%Monkeyweed21> yes
[3:35:49] <%SirKeigan> Wattson fences
[3:35:53] <Saltmeisterr> she has laser grids
[3:35:54] <+glgzephyr> your partner has zone control
[3:35:55] <+Das_Prints> @draco_renegade They apparently tried in early versions of the game but couldn‚Äôt make them balanced. Either they were too strong to deal with or too weak which at that point they didn‚Äôt feel like Titans.
[3:35:55] <MagicalBiscuit> yeah thats watsons ability
[3:35:55] <@SSaryn> @AlteisenReiseZ Also fair enough
[3:35:55] <+RootVeggie> Wattson can put down electric fences
[3:35:59] <+samuraijoe_> amamilk
[3:36:03] <%SirKeigan> They do damage
[3:36:05] <%cobalt_phoenix_> do they damage?
[3:36:05] <huskarl_zap> hulk hogan's finisher is him sitting on someones face
[3:36:06] <+Das_Prints> Maybe one day for an event.
[3:36:08] <%barrakuta371> That's Watsons abilitym, she can lay down defenses that shocks people
[3:36:08] <+glgzephyr> wattson is pretty cool, I like her gimmick
[3:36:08] <@SSaryn> You can go through.
[3:36:10] <+POUND_CAKE94> Is there a hidden skill rank in this game for non-competitive?
[3:36:10] <%NKOrange> Yea elec fence
[3:36:12] <%cobalt_phoenix_> do they self damage?
[3:36:16] <+glgzephyr> yeah they do minor damage
[3:36:16] <%AlteisenReiseZ> You can pass through without getting hit
[3:36:17] <Smitteys867> @PatStaresAt you can walk through the fences
[3:36:21] <critfumble_> you're immune
[3:36:21] <MagicalBiscuit> you can walk though them without penalty
[3:36:22] <GPAlpha> You can pass her fences, so no worries
[3:36:23] <+glgzephyr> no self damage
[3:36:23] <superbla25> you can go through just fine
[3:36:25] <Zebroneath> It only hurts enemies
[3:36:26] <%NKOrange> No self damage
[3:36:26] <dustyjordans> you can walk through them
[3:36:27] <+RootVeggie> You can walk through the fences
[3:36:34] <+Das_Prints> Her fences alert you if people walk through them. It also does 15 damage and slows any enemy who walks through them.
[3:36:35] <%SirKeigan> KILL ALL MRVNs
[3:36:37] <+glgzephyr> it's like caustic and his gas
[3:36:40] <@SSaryn> I see.

[3:36:52] <%SirKeigan> But that's the direction you have to go in....
[3:36:54] <+glgzephyr> that mrvn scares me every time
[3:36:57] <+POUND_CAKE94> YEAH good punch

[3:37:08] <MagicalBiscuit> i dont really like the "lets bunker down" players
[3:37:09] <+Das_Prints> Wattson is one of the most meta characters at upper levels of ranked play.
[3:37:09] <%YakumoYomi> Sucked in!
[3:37:10] <%SirKeigan> If you get into this it's really fun dude
[3:37:11] <+glgzephyr> they're heeeeere

[3:37:48] <%Dakuu75> this is adorable... he's impressed by every little thing, lol
[3:37:57] <critfumble_> enemies know they've been scanned and see the pulse, friends get the wall hacks

[3:44:10] <+Das_Prints> Bye Wattson.
[3:44:10] <%SirKeigan> you forgot to heal
[3:44:11] <Smitteys867> SLIDE JUMP YOU CAN DO IT
[3:44:13] <Aydarkzero> d e t h
[3:44:14] <%cobalt_phoenix_> SLIDE
[3:44:14] <+POUND_CAKE94> ya other team bailed too lol
[3:44:14] <%barrakuta371> Caught between a sniper and wall of feath
[3:44:15] <Bloodninja15> It barely hurt
[3:44:16] <MagicalBiscuit> well it was an ok run
[3:44:17] <TheRageofAfrica> Heal
[3:44:19] <$Afterman_> rip
[3:44:20] <@SoFarFetched> LUL
[3:44:20] <berserker_103> shoulda slid
[3:44:22] <TheRageofAfrica> Heal while running
[3:44:22] <Bloodninja15> U got meds
[3:44:23] <+glgzephyr> you can heal in the zone, pat
[3:44:24] <%barrakuta371> *death
[3:44:24] <+lordericter> shoulda healed
[3:44:25] <+TheBitingIrish> ???
[3:44:26] <+zeitgeist134> damn
[3:44:27] <%Dakuu75> slide is faster
[3:44:27] <%koolaid_kevster> you shhould heal while your health is higher
[3:44:27] <%SirKeigan> because slide
[3:44:27] <+Deko_> slide is faster
[3:44:28] <%cobalt_phoenix_> because slide
[3:44:30] <black_mages_matter_> if you slide a bit you go faster
[3:44:32] <+POUND_CAKE94> Slightly better than Ocarina roll
[3:44:33] <tanarath> pat, slide moves quicker
[3:44:34] <BlindBarghest> solid round though
[3:44:34] <Saltmeisterr> u slowly de rusting
[3:44:34] <%koolaid_kevster> gives you more time
[3:44:35] <scrumbotime> It's "titanfall" slide is faster
[3:44:37] <+TheBitingIrish> Pat the big dumb
[3:44:38] <+natedrago> Damn
[3:44:38] <MagicalBiscuit> if you slide and jump you get farther distance than just running @PatStaresAt
[3:44:40] <+OhioNitsud> LUL
[3:44:42] <+Das_Prints> Fun little movement tech thing. If you jump right as you climb up something you get a little speed boost.
[3:44:43] <%OrangeMDT> slide is faster for about 1 sec
[3:44:44] <%Taisuru> Slide fast like sonic leghog
[3:44:48] <+glgzephyr> I don't think you played a ton of this
[3:44:48] <badjab326> repeatedly slide for optimal speed
[3:44:51] <Smitteys867> Its based on Titanfall movement bro, of course slide -> jump is good
[3:44:52] <%cobalt_phoenix_> slide jump is faster, it was a thing in tf
[3:44:53] <%SirKeigan> @patstaresat Put your gun away to run faster. Every five times your hands pop up do a crouch slide. That's the fastest way to move around
[3:44:55] <Aydarkzero> slide jumping just like in Crash
[3:44:55] <+POUND_CAKE94> Good accuracy with r301 tho
[3:45:00] <+Das_Prints> Sliding then jumping every couple seconds with your weapon out is the fastest way to move.
[3:45:02] <@SSaryn> For just coming back, honestly yeah.
[3:45:07] <%OrangeMDT> aiming? yeah
[3:45:10] <+Das_Prints> With your weapon put away*
[3:45:17] <Noogiez> is that beyonce?
[3:45:17] <black_mages_matter_> there's a video by i think a youtuber named Frothy talking about how to move as fast as possible on all sorts of angles and terrain @PatStaresAt
[3:45:21] <%Dakuu75> where does it show how many of those red-currency you have, it use to be in the top right, eh?
[3:45:21] <%SirKeigan> Gotta get rid of the new item symbol tho
[3:45:22] <+POUND_CAKE94> You got this
[3:45:27] <+Das_Prints> You are doing good for not playing this for months. It‚Äôs a learning process you got this.
[3:45:30] <Dao_Puppy> Oh hey mexican chun li.
[3:45:39] <%SirKeigan> iTemp is fun to watch
[3:45:43] <+glgzephyr> basic FPS stuff you're ok on, but there are a bunch of Apex mechanics that you have to learn or relearn
[3:45:43] <Smitteys867> FrothyOmen, used to do Titanfall guides too
[3:45:44] <%cobalt_phoenix_> oh member him, he did tons of tf2 stuff
[3:45:45] <huskarl_zap> Effluvial froath
[3:45:48] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Yeah, Apex has had a STEEP content upgrade
[3:45:54] <+POUND_CAKE94> I mean 2020 has lasted 3 years at least
[3:46:08] <%MechArch> she got a big ol head
[3:46:08] <badjab326> Theres a bundle you can buy now with all the characters

[3:47:44] <%cobalt_phoenix_> I can't believe it took like 3 or 4 battle royales for someone to realize "hey why not make sure you start with a gun instead of running around like a dipshit"
[3:47:46] <%AlteisenReiseZ> I still think you should hit rhe range
[3:47:53] <+glgzephyr> the L-Star was amazing when it came out. did it get nerfed?
[3:47:56] <GPAlpha> It's tourist mode for the map
[3:47:56] <critfumble_> don't it's free roam
[3:48:07] <%SirKeigan> It's free roam to explore shit and get your bearings
[3:48:09] <+Das_Prints> They buffed the L-star a bit this season but it‚Äôs still just alright. Better when used by Rampart though.
[3:48:09] <+tangoragahn> Did you pick up saying "Aww Jesus Lord," from Paige?
[3:48:10] <+POUND_CAKE94> l-star got buffed a bit just now
[3:48:11] <%cobalt_phoenix_> it's so you can see the pretty map

[3:48:59] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Roasted_Pheasant subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 27 months, currently on a 6 month streak! Howdy, Pat! Decided to move after a housemate assaulted me. Now I'm in a new house with a sweetbaby kitty, while they are stuck with a rodent problem... that I gave them.
[3:49:02] <@SoFarFetched> oh hi DK

[3:49:50] <+SimplyPandaz> Pat doesn't know how to jump huh
[3:49:54] <Saltmeisterr> DK when u gonna play this with pat?
[3:49:57] <%SirKeigan> wow

[3:49:59] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> @Roasted_Pheasant you got what I was going for crikIQ
[3:50:01] <critfumble_> l-star always kicks left at the start of its recoil pattern, adjust for that and you'll shread people, get a X1 holo for the best scope visibility
[3:50:02] <MagicalBiscuit> or am i confusing you with another sensitive nose dude
[3:50:04] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Car Pat Car
[3:50:07] <%DKDiamantes> Fuck that, I blow at BRs
[3:50:09] <%Roasted_Pheasant> @POUND_CAKE94 psaUp
[3:50:11] <%OrangeMDT> someone could've
[3:50:11] <%cobalt_phoenix_> s l i d e
[3:50:15] <huskarl_zap> she has a jump kit?
[3:50:20] <%SirKeigan> devotion is good
[3:50:22] <@Fuggins4U> Fuggins4U subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 15 months! 
[3:50:25] <Smitteys867> When diving, alternate between going steep/evening out
[3:50:25] <%SirKeigan> has to wind up tho
[3:50:28] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Find a turbocharger for it
[3:50:29] <+tangoragahn> Bullet jump Pat
[3:50:33] <%NKOrange> Run sliding is faster
[3:50:37] <BlindBarghest> emergy mmg
[3:50:39] <AFlyingTaco1> Devotion used to be my go-to for shredding Titans on foot
[3:50:40] <%NKOrange> Builds up speed
[3:50:42] <GPAlpha> The Devotion kicks ass, even though it's a windup gun
[3:50:43] <%cobalt_phoenix_> oh god the devotion is givin me nam flashbacks
[3:50:47] <+POUND_CAKE94> I quite enjoy the devotion
[3:50:56] <+POUND_CAKE94> was more fun as a CP drop
[3:50:58] <Smitteys867> Wait whats up with the names in the killfeed lol
[3:51:07] <critfumble_> are you feeling devoted chat
[3:51:07] <ItIsSky> devotion rips with a turbocharger
[3:51:14] <+Das_Prints> @patstaresat The spread on the mastiff gets tighter when you ADS so quick scoping with it is a good tactic.
[3:51:17] <MagicalBiscuit> streamer mode @Smitteys867
[3:51:18] <dustyjordans> @Smitteys867 he's in streamer mode, anonymizes names
[3:51:19] <%SirKeigan> Devotion started as carepackage right? Then out, then back in?
[3:51:23] <huskarl_zap> Crypto is dead hope you sold
[3:51:30] <+POUND_CAKE94> Correct
[3:51:36] <%OrangeMDT> yeah, who needs shield cells
[3:51:39] <ninjaguiden> Oniisama E
[3:51:42] <%SirKeigan> Trader mastiff for sniper
[3:51:43] <+POUND_CAKE94> With turbo it's still nasty
[3:51:44] <+Das_Prints> @sirkeigan It started as floor loot then got care packaged and is now back to floor loot.
[3:51:50] <%AlteisenReiseZ> The Volt will change your mind
[3:51:53] <critfumble_> Devo started out of CP, went in and is now back out
[3:51:53] <+glgzephyr> I like the triple take
[3:51:58] <amUusTV> I've really been feeling the itch to play this game again I heard there was some kind of update?
[3:52:01] <%SirKeigan> Volt is the best, no charge up
[3:52:03] <+glgzephyr> VEHICLES!?
[3:52:05] <ItIsSky> the volt is a good one but new gun
[3:52:05] <%SirKeigan> ye
[3:52:07] <Aydarkzero> oh cool they added vehicles
[3:52:08] <+Das_Prints> The volt is a beast.
[3:52:13] <%SirKeigan> let's go
[3:52:17] <amUusTV> Oh there are vehicles now alright
[3:52:22] <Aydarkzero> i haven't played this game in a minute
[3:52:24] <+glgzephyr> feels like a halo
[3:52:26] <GPAlpha> Yeah Pat, if you find a Volt, grab it
[3:52:35] <+Das_Prints> So the vehicles cannot deal damage by running into people. But you can strap things like Ramparts mini gun turret to it.
[3:52:41] <huskarl_zap> did that robot grapple?
[3:52:42] <MagicalBiscuit> you had some good strafes
[3:52:48] <TheHeroAppears> nice
[3:52:48] <Smitteys867> They had their hands full
[3:52:49] <@Fuggins4U> I helped by resubbing
[3:52:51] <+ThomasOfTroy> They were killing you?
[3:52:51] <Slim_Lipid> "Help Me" No :)
[3:52:51] <+glgzephyr> how is he supposed to help you when he is being shot
[3:52:53] <%cobalt_phoenix_> oof
[3:53:01] <ItIsSky> yeah, pathfinder has a grappling hook
[3:53:02] <+natedrago> Lol
[3:53:03] <+glgzephyr> Pat, you are selfish
[3:53:05] <%Pookiedaexzile> Nice shot
[3:53:05] <%Roasted_Pheasant> *snarf*
[3:53:06] <%OrangeMDT> oh no, pat pushes alone and yells when he is downed
[3:53:06] <%Pookiedaexzile> pog
[3:53:07] <@SoFarFetched> @Fuggins4U YOU....did it psaDab
[3:53:07] <%bevyrage> @huskarl_zap yeah the robot's skill is to grapple hook and he has real physics to it
[3:53:10] <%Chichen> Chichen subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 24 months, currently on a 24 month streak! 2 years for the best couch gremlin on twitch! Hope you're holding up Pat! Wishing Paigethe best. Give the babies a good shake!
[3:53:11] <%BoxNavy> :)
[3:53:12] <TheHeroAppears> can you not just play with muted viewers lol
[3:53:14] <+Das_Prints> @huskarl_zap That‚Äôs Pathfinder. His ability is a Titanfall style grapple hook and his ult places zip lines.
[3:53:21] <+BionicPulga> lemyGrin
[3:53:30] <+POUND_CAKE94> yuuuup
[3:53:30] <%leinadtonu> those pesky bullets didn't let's help
[3:53:35] <@SoFarFetched> he wouldn't trust us too
[3:53:35] <@SoFarFetched> Kappa
[3:53:39] <%SirKeigan> It says you have 1 friend in Apex. How about joining up with them?
[3:53:42] <@Fuggins4U> it's true, he does it to me each time =(
[3:53:43] <%bevyrage> pathfinder's passive is giving you a forecast for the circle iirc
[3:53:44] <MasterTonberry23> oh no that sounds like backbreaking work LUL
[3:53:48] <+glgzephyr> Pat is the kind of player that goes off by himself, dies, then yells at his partner for not helping him
[3:53:50] <%DKDiamantes> I wouldnt trust us either
[3:53:52] <+POUND_CAKE94> Lifeline + Bloodhound = fun
[3:53:55] <@SoFarFetched> @SSaryn GEE I WONDER WHO THAT FRIEND IS
[3:53:56] <theanora1> Call up Woolie, and be like "yo"
[3:53:59] <Aydarkzero> somebody would absolutely body block lmao
[3:53:59] <%VashyronM> Is Apex good yet?
[3:53:59] <%Roasted_Pheasant> If Lifeline from New Orleans?
[3:54:03] <%barrakuta371> @Fuggins4U Sadge
[3:54:06] <%Jekado> he could just cut out the middle man and not add us in the first place just like he did Stace...
[3:54:10] <%SirKeigan> You and Woolie playing this would be FUCKING AWESOME
[3:54:14] <+POUND_CAKE94> NO WEVE SEEN WOOLIES AIM
[3:54:20] <+natedrago> Fair lol
[3:54:20] <%barrakuta371> LUL
[3:54:21] <+BionicPulga> lemyGun
[3:54:22] <%SirKeigan> LUL
[3:54:22] <%koolaid_kevster> LUL
[3:54:23] <tanarath> do it, Pat.
[3:54:23] <%luftraumm1> why not?
[3:54:23] <+Deko_> oof LUL
[3:54:24] <%Roasted_Pheasant> "Woolie come make me some content"
[3:54:25] <+Das_Prints> @vashyronm They fixed a lot of the issues it had at launch around season 2. It‚Äôs been really solid for a while.
[3:54:25] <%cobalt_phoenix_> the return of the setup
[3:54:26] <critfumble_> apex has been good for ages
[3:54:26] <MagicalBiscuit> LUL
[3:54:27] <Aydarkzero> Woolie aim LUL
[3:54:27] <%Taisuru> LUL
[3:54:27] <%AncelDeLambert> "Yo Woolie, run doubles with me." "Dude, it's 2am."
[3:54:29] <%Jekado> APEX ringer
[3:54:29] <+Oncila> LUL
[3:54:34] <%SirKeigan> It would be PEAK content
[3:54:34] <@SoFarFetched> that friend that's probably playing is most likely Ssaryn LUL
[3:54:35] <%AlteisenReiseZ> LET HIS GARBAGE ASS CONTROLLER/MOUSE SET UP SEND YOU TO VICTORY
[3:54:35] <tanarath> Scumbag it up
[3:54:35] <+natedrago> Lmaooooo
[3:54:36] <theanora1> exactly, with his weird half controller set up
[3:54:39] <%The_Protagonist> rebelHAHA rebelHAHA rebelHAHA
[3:54:40] <%Pookiedaexzile> If he plays apex with us now, how will he be able to monetize that relationship later. Big money moves require sacrifice
[3:54:44] <%leinadtonu> didn't he best you in overwatch?
[3:54:44] <%MechArch> no bully woolir
[3:54:46] <%barrakuta371> Woolie, that's a grenade
[3:54:48] <+dr1ove> are we esports now?
[3:54:49] <+AhegodKira> Try to hipfire more, ADS is more for midrange and longer
[3:54:50] <+tangoragahn> Woolie "FPS-Man" Madden
[3:54:59] <%AncelDeLambert> at least this level looks nice
[3:54:59] <+POUND_CAKE94> Woolie knows he cant aim tho it's all good
[3:55:03] <+glgzephyr> you get what you get
[3:55:03] <%OrangeMDT> are you not holding forward?
[3:55:07] <%SirKeigan> go upstairs
[3:55:10] <%SirKeigan> oh sna
[3:55:12] <+glgzephyr> can you shoot through the windows?
[3:55:17] <%SirKeigan> shoot
[3:55:20] <%SirKeigan> did you not see the other guy?
[3:55:22] <huskarl_zap> he didnt see?
[3:55:24] <Aydarkzero> Pat pls
[3:55:25] <+glgzephyr> amazing
[3:55:27] <+Deko_> reload battle
[3:55:28] <+POUND_CAKE94> no bullet penetration
[3:55:31] <%SirKeigan> yea
[3:55:32] <%barrakuta371> For the jump, you can do a "wave" motion
[3:55:34] <%cobalt_phoenix_> wow
[3:55:35] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Wow they... sucked...
[3:55:37] <%SirKeigan> they had a shotgun so just keep your distance
[3:55:38] <%AncelDeLambert> BIG MAN BIG KILLS
[3:55:38] <Aydarkzero> he do it
[3:55:38] <MagicalBiscuit> that was a battle between who could miss shots less
[3:55:38] <%AlteisenReiseZ> oh my god their aim
[3:55:39] <huskarl_zap> pat has woolie eyes now
[3:55:40] <Saltmeisterr> fucking incredible
[3:55:41] <%cobalt_phoenix_> they missed so many shots
[3:55:43] <+POUND_CAKE94> His 1v1s tonight have gone very well
[3:55:43] <%SirKeigan> get the other shield back
[3:55:46] <%SirKeigan> but heal it
[3:55:46] <huskarl_zap> he can only see green and purple
[3:55:50] <+el_machucapapas> keep blue
[3:55:50] <+Das_Prints> Basic jump thing is if you are jumping to something 500-450 m away aim straight at it. If it‚Äôs farther then you have to dip to build up speed then leave out again to gain distance.
[3:55:50] <%SirKeigan> NOOOOOOOO
[3:55:52] <+POUND_CAKE94> And 2v1s lol
[3:55:52] <%SirKeigan> phoenix kit
[3:56:03] <%AlteisenReiseZ> TAKE THE VOLT
[3:56:04] <BlindBarghest> tbf Havoc recoil pattern is rough
[3:56:05] <%SirKeigan> take the volt
[3:56:07] <%SirKeigan> much better
[3:56:10] <%AlteisenReiseZ> YEAAA
[3:56:15] <+POUND_CAKE94> Get big mag on it
[3:56:17] <+Das_Prints> Nice work.
[3:56:18] <Aydarkzero> is Volt a new weapon?
[3:56:23] <ItIsSky> volt doesn't have wind up but it's a smg
[3:56:26] <LorcaNomad> volt stomps
[3:56:32] <Smitteys867> Bat shield up
[3:56:34] <%SirKeigan> good idea
[3:56:35] <Smitteys867> *pat
[3:56:35] <+POUND_CAKE94> Ya once they altered Havocs recoil I got off it
[3:56:36] <%AlteisenReiseZ> @Aydarkzero Yeah, came from season 6
[3:56:36] <%barrakuta371> @Aydarkzero It got added last season
[3:56:38] <+glgzephyr> new to pat!
[3:56:41] <%SirKeigan> you'll find light ammo
[3:56:45] <critfumble_> volt is a Titanfall weapon
[3:56:45] <+Das_Prints> It‚Äôs an energy smg. It‚Äôs just solid and has no weird gimmicks. Great damage and manageable recoil.
[3:56:48] <Saltmeisterr> whats the deal with energy weapons?
[3:56:52] <Aydarkzero> nice, thanks chat
[3:56:55] <Saltmeisterr> what the do?
[3:56:58] <%Pookiedaexzile> When do you go to the gulag
[3:56:58] <black_mages_matter_> wait they added the volt?
[3:56:59] <+el_machucapapas> volt is good but too low on ammo
[3:57:00] <Saltmeisterr> they do*
[3:57:06] <+glgzephyr> no, yes
[3:57:07] <+POUND_CAKE94> Are energy weapons hitscan?
[3:57:17] <%SirKeigan> npo
[3:57:18] <pelonsinvalle> no
[3:57:20] <Aydarkzero> need shield monkaS
[3:57:20] <%SirKeigan> no, just less drop
[3:57:25] <%Dakuu75> is Volt just an energy, R99?
[3:57:25] <%SirKeigan> Charge Rifle is hitscan
[3:57:27] <critfumble_> energy weapons are medium damage and low bullet drop
[3:57:29] <+POUND_CAKE94> ah thank you
[3:57:30] <+glgzephyr> I thought triple take was hitscan?
[3:57:32] <%ZephynM> No weapon in Apex has hitscan
[3:57:32] <+Das_Prints> @saltmeisterr They have the fastest projectile speed generally and least bullet drop.
[3:57:34] <%ZephynM> I think
[3:57:39] <%barrakuta371> @Dakuu75 Kinda
[3:57:40] <+POUND_CAKE94> Ya charge rifle better be HS lol
[3:57:46] <%SirKeigan> Charge Rifle is hitscan, no?
[3:57:47] <+glgzephyr> but Charge Rifle
[3:57:49] <+hashmalknight> the alt fire on the havoc is hitscan
[3:57:54] <%ZephynM> Even Charge Rifle has a travel delay between each tick far as I know
[3:57:56] <Saltmeisterr> ok so they good for mid to long range
[3:57:56] <+el_machucapapas> Yeah Volt=R99
[3:58:03] <+Das_Prints> The only gun in this game that is Hitscane is the charge rifle and the alternate fire on the havoc, which got taken out this season.
[3:58:11] <%SirKeigan> Yea bloodhound doesn't need them
[3:58:14] <+glgzephyr> but it may as well be hitscan
[3:58:15] <+POUND_CAKE94> makes sense to me
[3:58:18] <ItIsSky> there were also a bunch of weapons that got regroups as sniper weapons a long while back
[3:58:20] <%SirKeigan> oh yea, no more alt fire havocs now
[3:58:21] <+POUND_CAKE94> tru
[3:58:31] <critfumble_> I'm one of the like 4 people that really liked the alt fire on the havoc I'm sad it's gone
[3:58:33] <+glgzephyr> wow no alt fire havoc? woowwwww
[3:58:39] <%ZephynM> Guess I remember wrong. I seldom use Charge Rifle and Havoc's lousy semi-auto
[3:58:42] <SaltyDavid> Don't shoot the robot >:(
[3:58:44] <+ThomasOfTroy> Drag
[3:58:44] <+glgzephyr> goodbye gun
[3:58:46] <+Das_Prints> @critfumble_ I liked it to.
[3:58:46] <Smitteys867> You dont have to swap guns to equip attatchments
[3:58:48] <+POUND_CAKE94> Care PAckage Prowler prolly OD tho haven't used it yet
[3:58:49] <+hashmalknight> also ifrc energy weapons have less drop off
[3:58:51] <ItIsSky> oh right, the select fire is gone now
[3:58:52] <%OrangeMDT> stocks should go on larger weapons
[3:58:53] <%SirKeigan> the other button
[3:59:01] <%SirKeigan> yeyeye
[3:59:02] <%Dakuu75> I haven't played since like... season 5, is there somewhere that'll catch me up on weapon-patches?
[3:59:04] <%SirKeigan> good optics
[3:59:10] <+glgzephyr> @ZephynM I remember the charge rifle having HS being a big deal when it came out
[3:59:16] <%SirKeigan> arc stars are good
[3:59:17] <+glgzephyr> that was about when I stopped playing
[3:59:26] <Hyphixsys> LUL
[3:59:26] <+POUND_CAKE94> Their Patch Notes are pretty simple and accessible
[3:59:29] <Aydarkzero> Pat do okay
[3:59:32] <+el_machucapapas> Select fire is a hop up
[3:59:43] <Saltmeisterr> how many maps are there?
[3:59:45] <Saltmeisterr> 3?
[3:59:47] <%SirKeigan> After this match go over your sensitivity settings. We may be able to help you there if you're having any difficulties @PatStaresAt
[3:59:50] <+POUND_CAKE94> Oh yeah big slides
[3:59:53] <SaltyDavid> yes
[3:59:59] <+POUND_CAKE94> This stream sponsored by Slide-N-Slide
[4:00:02] <%SirKeigan> 3 but 2 in rotation
[4:00:08] <%SirKeigan> Kings Canyon is sidelined this season
[4:00:18] <+glgzephyr> is there crossplay now?
[4:00:26] <%SirKeigan> yup
[4:00:27] <fran031> Nice to see a saturated map in this game
[4:00:32] <+POUND_CAKE94> Console CrossPlay
[4:00:34] <+Das_Prints> @dakuu75 They added the volt, they got rid of the choke hop up and select fire. Triple take has the choke built in now. This season the prowler is a care package weapon and wingman and Re-45 got a new hop up that affects weapon ads and switch speeds and tighter hip fire accuracy.
[4:00:48] <ItIsSky> yeah , it is Olympus only for like 10 more days and then the rotation is this and World's Edge, right?
[4:00:51] <+glgzephyr> So if I'm on Steam, I could play with a ps4 friend? or is that a no go
[4:01:06] <ItIsSky> yeah, there is cross play now
[4:01:08] <+POUND_CAKE94> No Steam and Console as far as I know
[4:01:19] <+Das_Prints> @dakuu75 also they added mid-matchcrafting in season 6 that lets you make healing items, gear and attachments with materials you pick up around the map and from loot bins.
[4:01:21] <+POUND_CAKE94> ohman
[4:01:23] <Smitteys867> Only between steam and origin I thinkl
[4:01:31] <zipfile777> so steam winning no matter what
[4:01:31] <ItIsSky> PC and console can play, but it is on pc servers
[4:01:35] <Hyphixsys> just console crossplays
[4:01:38] <%SirKeigan> I have PS4 and played with my brother on Steam
[4:01:42] <+POUND_CAKE94> Oh rly??
[4:01:44] <critfumble_> crossplay is opt in for consoles
[4:01:48] <Hyphixsys> pc crossplays with pc
[4:01:49] <huskarl_zap> If origin wasnt mandatory no one would use it
[4:01:51] <%ZephynM> I don't know if console has friends cross platform
[4:01:51] <%OrangeMDT> @POUND_CAKE94 I'm afraid you don't know, friend
[4:01:52] <+glgzephyr> oh shit
[4:01:59] <%ZephynM> Also, I've played with console players on the Steam version
[4:02:03] <Smitteys867> Drop the mag
[4:02:04] <%SirKeigan> I just said I did lol
[4:02:06] <ItIsSky> if the party is all console, then it's console servers
[4:02:08] <critfumble_> console players can't join pc lobbies unless they're parting with pc players
[4:02:09] <CurrySauseBandit> This loot goblining is going to kill him LUL
[4:02:10] <+POUND_CAKE94> @OrangeMDT I'm afraid too, friend
[4:02:11] <%GarbageNirvana> I know I wouldn't want to crossplay with PC on this myself
[4:02:11] <SaltyDavid> Has Pat tried grappling hook on a moving hover car? It's some wacky shit
[4:02:16] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Wait Lifeline is supposed to be JAMAICAN?

[4:02:39] <%SirKeigan> Try tongue, but hole
[4:02:40] <+ThomasOfTroy> missed mag
[4:02:40] <+glgzephyr> I wouldn't want to crossplay normally, but one of my two friends that play this game only has ps4
[4:02:40] <%Roasted_Pheasant> She sounds Cajun as fuck
[4:02:43] <+POUND_CAKE94> But/whole
[4:02:49] <%SirKeigan> grenade

[4:03:51] <+Das_Prints> Nice! How you liking that Volt?
[4:03:58] <%OrangeMDT> yo, Pat can aim that gun pretty alright
[4:03:58] <+ThomasOfTroy> Between the boxes

[4:04:00] <SaltyDavid> That lifeline revive buff is soooo strong
[4:04:03] <%luftraumm1> wouldn't a grenade work well there?
[4:04:06] <%SirKeigan> dro the heavy mag!
[4:04:08] <%koolaid_kevster> now i gotta play apex in hopes i fnid ytou and murder you
[4:04:10] <superbla25> energy mag right there
[4:04:16] <+Das_Prints> Volt has pretty solid hip fire accuracy as well for close range.
[4:04:19] <+el_machucapapas> More light ammo
[4:04:24] <%kyh9> How's the new map?
[4:04:44] <%OrangeMDT> now we just gotta work on knowing when to push, reload, use abilities, and all that other stuff... but yeah, the aiming is nice
[4:04:55] <%ZephynM> I like the new map. The only one that was pretty good on release.
[4:04:59] <%SirKeigan> Click L3 to zoom in
[4:05:15] <%SirKeigan> scans dude
[4:05:18] <%ZephynM> To be fair, he is using a controller which has aim assist. @OrangeMDT lol
[4:05:23] <+Das_Prints> I‚Äôve been having fun with it. The open spaces have been making Rampart more relevant which I‚Äôve been loving.
[4:05:33] <Smitteys867> NO PAT
[4:05:33] <%barrakuta371> God Volt is so good
[4:05:36] <%Dakuu75> suprise lol

[4:06:09] <%Chichen> @PatStaresAt you saw them before you went into backpack :(
[4:06:11] <%OrangeMDT> I can't believe Pat didn't see him
[4:06:13] <+ImpHelpSingIt> is pat playing with a squad
[4:06:13] <Profmcstevie> Get out of sightlines, stop playing in the middle of the road barbAwk
[4:06:13] <+el_machucapapas> foot steps!!!
[4:06:15] <BlindBarghest> Nice match though
[4:06:17] <%SirKeigan> You just need to get faste rwith the looting
[4:06:20] <%Pookiedaexzile> Watching pat play apex at a non cracked level gives a lotta context
[4:06:22] <%SirKeigan> Otherwise you're doing well
[4:06:22] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> right in front of you too
[4:06:23] <%ZephynM> Yikes. He didn't see the dude before he started looting and couldn't hear them.
[4:06:24] <Grandma_Amari> Killed by tunnel vision
[4:06:25] <+POUND_CAKE94> Pat if you want a dub try the Scum Strat
[4:06:26] <%SirKeigan> Just faster looting dude and you're good
[4:06:27] <%Piemono> Got greedy, you saw that guy
[4:06:29] <+Das_Prints> Good fights though. Not a win but it was a good effort.

[4:07:19] <%kyh9> Level up shield
[4:07:21] <%Ascethetic> evo
[4:07:22] <%kyh9> I think?
[4:07:22] <Saltmeisterr> max evo shield
[4:07:24] <+POUND_CAKE94> hahaha explain red evo in under 5 words
[4:07:24] <%kyh9> Evo shield?
[4:07:24] <ninjaguiden> Tell her that
[4:07:25] <AlecLeland> Hello. :)
[4:07:25] <Aydarkzero> wait what
[4:07:27] <SaltyDavid> Shields can evolve to level 5 now
[4:07:27] <%OrangeMDT> 125 extra shield
[4:07:28] <ItIsSky> next shield is the max level
[4:07:30] <%ZephynM> @PatStaresAt Red shield is max level evo shield, it has 125 armor
[4:07:30] <%GarbageNirvana> Chris Redshield
[4:07:31] <critfumble_> better than purple
[4:07:31] <Grandma_Amari> Jangore posted gamer, they're going to gain subscribers.
[4:07:31] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> thats the EVO
[4:07:32] <%SirKeigan> What were they doing there?
[4:07:33] <CurrySauseBandit> Lvl 4 Evo. 125 hp
[4:07:33] <ItIsSky> *red shield
[4:07:34] <%SirKeigan> weird
[4:07:34] <pelonsinvalle> did she hear you? lol
[4:07:37] <+el_machucapapas> Only by doing damage
[4:07:40] <%barrakuta371> takes 125 damage, as opposed to 100 for purple
[4:07:42] <%Dakuu75> "evo" shield. "evolution" it's the highest tier
[4:07:49] <huskarl_zap> Rothchilds?
[4:07:50] <ItIsSky> you can gain shields with damage now
[4:07:52] <Smitteys867> By dealing damage with Evo shields you level them up
[4:07:52] <%wibbwobbler> highest level evo armor, aside from gold which has to be found
[4:07:58] <black_mages_matter_> is red better than gold?
[4:08:00] <%kyh9> This bitch only has 10 kills?
[4:08:04] <%kyh9> That's impressive
[4:08:08] <%kyh9> That they're doing so well rn
[4:08:09] <%SirKeigan> 3 other squads left. They're gonna come after you when they see the respawn ship
[4:08:11] <pelonsinvalle> gold has double heal
[4:08:12] <Hyphixsys> @huskarl_zap using billionaires as shields Kappa
[4:08:13] <+ImpHelpSingIt> bring me back to life
[4:08:14] <ItIsSky> red vs gold depends
[4:08:15] <+el_machucapapas> This respawn gonna be rough
[4:08:20] <%kyh9> I cant believe it
[4:08:22] <%ZephynM> @black_mages_matter_ Depends what you go for. Double efficiency on recovery items with gold or +25 defense
[4:08:24] <%kyh9> Pat doesnt deserve the respawn
[4:08:26] <+POUND_CAKE94> 10 kills with this char on this platform on this acct anything is possible
[4:08:26] <%Dakuu75> resurrection~!
[4:08:27] <%Chichen> don't disappoint them pat
[4:08:28] <fran031> Red has more armor, gold has a passive
[4:08:29] <SaltyDavid> A lot of people are playing for the first time today
[4:08:29] <mistspade> did ghost runner not go well?
[4:08:30] <%ZephynM> Both Gold and Red are good options
[4:08:31] <+Deko_> lets hope no one is camping the beacon
[4:08:34] <critfumble_> gold isnt as heavy duty as red but has other benefits
[4:08:34] <huskarl_zap> 10 billion space dollar shields
[4:08:37] <ItIsSky> gold gives you more health/shields with cells and syringes
[4:08:39] <%kyh9> Not noticing footsteps again, I put $10 on it
[4:08:41] <+POUND_CAKE94> 4 squads left oooo
[4:08:52] <+lordericter> oh god you are unarmed when you respawn
[4:08:54] <Aydarkzero> it's better than nothing
[4:08:54] <%Dakuu75> are there still portable-rez items?
[4:09:03] <SaltyDavid> yes
[4:09:04] <+POUND_CAKE94> yes daku
[4:09:05] <%kyh9> What a good teammate
[4:09:15] <+wmeldrum> this guy is too good
[4:09:18] <+ImpHelpSingIt> winnable
[4:09:22] <%kyh9> I'd like to live here
[4:09:23] <+Das_Prints> True lifeline mains are team players.
[4:09:26] <huskarl_zap> Players unknown battle grounds clones are dead memes
[4:09:29] <+POUND_CAKE94> winnable with carry and luck
[4:09:30] <%kyh9> Too good, too pure of a teammate for Pat
[4:09:30] <NHKira> !uptime
[4:09:30] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 9m.
[4:09:38] <+lordericter> not if they have shields you don't
[4:09:39] <%SirKeigan> let her go in first
[4:09:42] <+glgzephyr> imagine the lifeline player being good at team play
[4:09:45] <%SirKeigan> take a back seat for a minute
[4:09:46] <CurrySauseBandit> 20 shots of mastiff? Plenty of ammo
[4:09:48] <%Dakuu75> suddenly it's Doom in here
[4:09:49] <%wibbwobbler> it's endgame now
[4:09:51] <%SirKeigan> takeyour time
[4:09:53] <%kyh9> EVO SHIELD
[4:09:58] <%SirKeigan> hurry
[4:10:00] <Saltmeisterr> AMMO
[4:10:02] <+POUND_CAKE94> #hotswap
[4:10:06] <+Das_Prints> They can probably pull off a win if they play it safe and third party the last two teams.
[4:10:16] <%kyh9> GET YOUR ULT UP
[4:10:19] <Smitteys867> Get more light ammo!
[4:10:21] <+Deko_> use ultimate accelerant
[4:10:24] <%SirKeigan> You're good
[4:10:29] <+POUND_CAKE94> Scum it out
[4:10:30] <%SirKeigan> Good as you'll be for now
[4:10:33] <+el_machucapapas> LIGHT AMMO
[4:10:35] <%SirKeigan> drop some syringes tho, too many
[4:10:36] <%kyh9> Will Pat get the chicken dinner?
[4:10:37] <+lordericter> just outlast the other 6 schmups
[4:10:45] <%SirKeigan> othe rmenhu
[4:10:48] <huskarl_zap> seeing that eva 8 makes me wonder if lastamoures score is even beatable
[4:10:51] <%SirKeigan> drop some syringes
[4:11:06] <%OrangeMDT> now you're thinking with abilities
[4:11:10] <%SirKeigan> just listen for fighting
[4:11:10] <%JeanGardner99> was that a gold shield in that pod?
[4:11:17] <+POUND_CAKE94> if you hear the last two squads fighting check it out
[4:11:21] <Profmcstevie> Juiced and goosed, lets win this hboxPog
[4:11:22] <+glgzephyr> you're so far

[4:12:09] <+POUND_CAKE94> RIP
[4:12:09] <+Das_Prints> Good healing item economy is like 2 stacks of Batteries,2 stacks of cells, 1 stack of syringes and med kits and a Phoenix kit. But it‚Äôs variable.
[4:12:09] <%kyh9> gg
[4:12:09] <%SirKeigan> siwtch guns dude
[4:12:11] <+ImpHelpSingIt> oh noooooo
[4:12:11] <%kyh9> Good run
[4:12:12] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Nice Aim
[4:12:12] <Saltmeisterr> Jesus christ man
[4:12:14] <Smitteys867> shouldve used your shotgun
[4:12:15] <+glgzephyr> the OCD reload killed you LUL
[4:12:15] <%barrakuta371> sadge
[4:12:15] <%SirKeigan> switching guns is always faster than reloading
[4:12:16] <pelonsinvalle> you should have swapped to mastiff
[4:12:16] <+Kalabroun> damn
[4:12:17] <%OrangeMDT> don't worry, it goes away after a few dozen games
[4:12:21] <%kyh9> should have popped your ult tbh
[4:12:21] <NHKira> GG pat
[4:12:21] <%Pookiedaexzile> Boi if you dont-
[4:12:24] <+Deko_> thats bullshit
[4:12:24] <+POUND_CAKE94> That was a great teammate u had there
[4:12:25] <%Ranryu692> psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead
[4:12:28] <BlindBarghest> Dang coulda got them
[4:12:30] <+glgzephyr> you went through less than half your clip before reloading
[4:12:32] <%wibbwobbler> VoteYea
[4:12:35] <+Das_Prints> Nice try. You had good fights. It was a nice attempt.
[4:12:35] <%SirKeigan> Yea, gotta do that
[4:12:35] <+POUND_CAKE94> U should switch
[4:12:36] <%Pookiedaexzile> Pat Confirmed not cracked
[4:12:37] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Man that gun has a TERRIBLE clip size
[4:12:38] <pelonsinvalle> then you are wrong
[4:12:38] <%Taisuru> LUL
[4:12:40] <%SirKeigan> Get used to it
[4:12:41] <%Fooguwu> then perish
[4:12:44] <BlindBarghest> depends on the mag and guns
[4:12:46] <critfumble_> time to learn then
[4:12:47] <olaksi> Uhuh
[4:12:48] <Dao_Puppy> We need little V up in here.
[4:12:49] <+glgzephyr> Pat you need to switch guns instead of reloading that's like the FIRST RULE of multiplayer shooters
[4:12:49] <+Das_Prints> It really is.
[4:12:50] <%OrangeMDT> I don't think you've ever intentionally reloaded in a gun fight either
[4:12:54] <Grandma_Amari> Then get used to it because it's super useful
[4:12:55] <%Taisuru> I think switching guns being faster is true for every fps
[4:12:56] <%SirKeigan> Other than that you're doing good
[4:12:57] <%Piemono> You should learn to though
[4:12:57] <Saltmeisterr> guess u will die then
[4:12:57] <+Draco_Renegade> I do that and have won most of my fights.
[4:12:58] <+Das_Prints> It is faster.
[4:12:59] <%SirKeigan> You need to learn these tactics
[4:13:00] <%Dakuu75> yeah, it is unnatural. but, it's the way to do it. (depending on load out)
[4:13:01] <Profmcstevie> If you're dry and you're in the middle of fire you need bullets, swap guns hboxEyes
[4:13:02] <Hyphixsys> shoot the gun Kappa
[4:13:02] <%NKOrange> Welp then
[4:13:02] <BlindBarghest> Better stocks make you switch faster
[4:13:05] <+Aresius_> That grass is nice
[4:13:07] <+POUND_CAKE94> Doesn't matter what You want if you want a dub
[4:13:11] <%OrangeMDT> my b then
[4:13:29] <Smitteys867> You were also using a rifle at point blank when you had a shotgun sooooo
[4:13:32] <%SirKeigan> Hey elmo

[4:13:44] <%Taisuru> SHOW EMLO
[4:13:45] <%ZephynM> I like this season, but I be playing Astral Chain now and I'm hooked.
[4:13:47] <Grandma_Amari> HE IS GOOD AND HE IS SWEET
[4:13:50] <+glgzephyr> has he even shot the mastiff?
[4:13:53] <Dao_Puppy> No seriously, what's in the black hole?
[4:13:58] <+ImpHelpSingIt> he got some nice feet too
[4:14:00] <%kyh9> Duos vs Trios?
[4:14:02] <+POUND_CAKE94> It takes a bit to warm up to this game's split-second decisions
[4:14:03] <%wibbwobbler> psaWink
[4:14:07] <%Roasted_Pheasant> You should have shoot-shooted better. psaDab
[4:14:08] <+glgzephyr> it's a blitzball arena

[4:14:28] <+POUND_CAKE94> Blitzball x Apex crossover 2021
[4:14:31] <+Das_Prints> @dao_puppy There‚Äôs some ruined buildings and a big orb in the center. You can run into the orb to teleport to other places around the map.
[4:14:38] <%ZephynM> Imagine if Pat tried playing this game when there was the bug where you'd get whatever item was off-screen when facing a weapon
[4:14:41] <+Deko_> he is not the angriest pat anymore
[4:14:43] <+POUND_CAKE94> Pathfinder vs Jecht

[4:16:04] <Saltmeisterr> mode*
[4:16:04] <+Extrallent> lol
[4:16:06] <@SoFarFetched> had a feeling he was gonna die soon LUL
[4:16:07] <%Roasted_Pheasant> To avoid bad names
[4:16:07] <Aydarkzero> did Pat win that last game? i went to get a drink
[4:16:10] <$RealThiele> LUL
[4:16:12] <%wibbwobbler> psaDab
[4:16:13] <%SirKeigan> streamer mode is not what you want
[4:16:13] <Grandma_Amari> Ooooh
[4:16:15] <Aydarkzero> w/ the lifeline
[4:16:16] <Grandma_Amari> That makes sense
[4:16:17] <%Taisuru> How could you fail Dragoblast like that
[4:16:19] <%SirKeigan> you want the other mode to hide yourname
[4:16:20] <%ZephynM> I think they just call it anonymous mode now or something
[4:16:25] <@SoFarFetched> just get better
[4:16:27] <xxshadowxx416> no it not
[4:16:32] <+POUND_CAKE94> Need 1 more good teammate

[4:16:40] <%SirKeigan> no it's not, these are newbs
[4:16:41] <+Das_Prints> @aydarkzero He got close but they pushed a team and it didn‚Äôt work out. They got 4th. It was a good attempt.
[4:16:42] <%wibbwobbler> 1 v multiple is very rough
[4:16:51] <Taleek> Is this on PC?
[4:16:53] <Aydarkzero> @Das_Prints ah bummer
[4:16:55] <+glgzephyr> oh does this have SBMM?
[4:16:56] <%MelBrooksKA> @Aydarkzero Dropped it last second, refused to switch guns when he ran out of bullets
[4:16:57] <%OrangeMDT> long as you're havin' fun, everything's fine
[4:16:58] <pelonsinvalle> has apex confirmed anything for next gen?
[4:17:01] <+POUND_CAKE94> Oh gibby
[4:17:10] <+POUND_CAKE94> It does that on console too
[4:17:12] <Profmcstevie> "Here's 5 PS1s, we're very sorry"
[4:17:13] <Aydarkzero> @MelBrooksKA rip
[4:17:19] <%Taisuru> SHOW EMLO psaPorgmo
[4:17:19] <%SirKeigan> Gibby is fun
[4:17:22] <%SirKeigan> look for a sniper rifle
[4:17:25] <%Jack8274> Shit
[4:17:28] <huskarl_zap> apex confirmed for not being titanfall3
[4:17:30] <+Das_Prints> Yeah wins come in time. I mostly just have fun as long as I get one or two good fights a match even if I go down.
[4:17:34] <%Jack8274> 34 kills in a round?
[4:17:39] <Saltmeisterr> gibby who?
[4:17:42] <+POUND_CAKE94> Gibby aka Tito from Rocket Power but with a gun
[4:17:47] <%OrangeMDT> @pelonsinvalle no fully optimized upgrade, but it'll be playable day one
[4:17:48] <+wmeldrum> it's woolies controller setup trying to break in
[4:17:50] <Aydarkzero> couldn't pre-order a ps5 so now i have to hunt for one
[4:17:53] <Saltmeisterr> oh gibralter

[4:18:08] <%shinzm1911> shinzm1911 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 9 months! Do the shoot. Does this game have Vergil's Anti-Baby rifle?
[4:18:10] <Aydarkzero> LUL

[4:18:18] <%SirKeigan> hope for a gun
[4:18:19] <+glgzephyr> the panic set in

[4:18:25] <%ZephynM> @Aydarkzero Good hunting. May your kill be swift and your escape swifter.
[4:18:26] <%Roasted_Pheasant> @shinzm1911 BLAST!
[4:18:31] <huskarl_zap> OhMyDog
[4:18:32] <+Das_Prints> @huskarl_zap They‚Äôve been adding the Titanfall stuff into the lore more and more. Season 5 and 6 involved Ash from Titanfall 2 and Blisk reappeared in season 6 to recruit Rampart.
[4:18:34] <+POUND_CAKE94> Should this game have a quick restart button post-game instead of going to lobby?
[4:18:38] <+vampireinarm> is Pat being bad at shooters with a controller again
[4:18:40] <Saltmeisterr> i thought u where talking bout the guy he waas playing with lol
[4:18:51] <+Das_Prints> Some leaks make it sounds like Blisk and Ash are planned to be legends in the next couple seasons.
[4:18:53] <ItIsSky> sometimes you have to devote to the punchfight
[4:18:53] <%Taisuru> Elmo quit sassin your father

[4:19:08] <%MelBrooksKA> @vampireinarm yes
[4:19:11] <%ZephynM> When StarCraft 2 came out, I saw a fat neck-beard kind of fat guy run out of the store full sprint and straight up drove over the curbs into the street full-throttle
[4:19:19] <StoneBuffalo> literally staring at apex legends
[4:19:22] <%shinzm1911> Sorry, I just got here. I'm drunk and I don't know what this game do. lmao
[4:19:22] <+POUND_CAKE94> Pat is actually doing quite OK at shooters with a controller at the moment
[4:19:26] <+ImpHelpSingIt> your first mistake was trying to understand a cat

[4:19:47] <%MechArch> sipsipHellmo sipsipHellmo
[4:19:51] <%ZephynM> @shinzm1911 The game do is this: You find stuff and murder other players with said stuff you find
[4:19:55] <Aydarkzero> dang
[4:20:00] <huskarl_zap> @ZephynM Jessie cox?
[4:20:02] <+POUND_CAKE94> Gibby round 2
[4:20:08] <@SoFarFetched> Elmo wants his winner winner chicken dinner
[4:20:11] <%ZephynM> @huskarl_zap Yes?
[4:20:12] <%Taisuru> I like to imagine elmo jumped onto the couch, farted and then ran off
[4:20:14] <%shinzm1911> Got it
[4:20:24] <%shinzm1911> Also you guys hear THAT EDGE?
[4:20:29] <huskarl_zap> forskin XD
[4:20:32] <Aydarkzero> Elmo tired
[4:20:33] <%Fooguwu> i cant believe covid is gonna be this bad for 2 more years :(
[4:20:34] <+POUND_CAKE94> Elmo VS cat alzheimers
[4:20:38] <%ZephynM> I don't know who Jessie Cox is until I did a quick google search.
[4:20:54] <xxshadowxx416> @Fooguwu what
[4:20:56] <+natedrago> ScaredyCat
[4:20:57] <huskarl_zap> woolie jets
[4:20:58] <+POUND_CAKE94> @ZephynM and you're smarter for it
[4:21:04] <Aydarkzero> Jessie Cox is cool
[4:21:14] <pelonsinvalle> I only know jessie for the chilluminati podcast
[4:21:21] <%GarbageNirvana> I started following Jesse Cox shortly after I discovered TotalBiscuit since the two did a lot of stuff together
[4:21:25] <+Das_Prints> You can run into the big orb in the center to teleport around.
[4:21:31] <Aydarkzero> i listen to his podcast w/ Crendor
[4:21:31] <%GarbageNirvana> Dude's always good for a laugh imo
[4:21:32] <%SirKeigan> increase the FOV
[4:21:38] <%SirKeigan> higher FOV feels faster
[4:21:39] <%Fooguwu> @xxshadowxx416 according to Nicholas Christakis. Covid vaccine in 1 year, but not widely spread for 2 years
[4:21:45] <+POUND_CAKE94> Big Tankman is Gibby's Kojima name
[4:21:57] <%JeanGardner99> higher fov is speeed
[4:21:59] <%YakumoYomi> I think he also does Critical Roll streams (D&D) on Twitch?
[4:22:04] <+Das_Prints> Gibraltar and Caustic feel slower because they are taller and slower running animations but they move the same exact speeds as every legends.
[4:22:05] <%ZephynM> Gibby only seems slow. He's just a chonk so he kinda sways
[4:22:06] <%GarbageNirvana> He's also working through the FFXIV expansions which is always fun to watch
[4:22:21] <$RealThiele> Jesse has been doing a ton of FF14 streaming recently
[4:22:22] <Aydarkzero> ye
[4:22:40] <%SirKeigan> no
[4:22:50] <+glgzephyr> you just dropped a 4-8x...
[4:22:50] <%Areus> Areus subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 28 months! ravage2ballz
[4:22:52] <+POUND_CAKE94> Oh is the new Quickdraw thing worth it? I assume so
[4:22:59] <+glgzephyr> this hurts
[4:23:02] <%SirKeigan> now go use the sniper scoepe that you dropped
[4:23:06] <%SirKeigan> oh boy
[4:23:07] <%Dakuu75> oh wow, I jsut noticed they put the pc logo next to names
[4:23:10] <huskarl_zap> mrleow
[4:23:17] <+glgzephyr> you still have time to get it
[4:23:21] <+glgzephyr> it's right there
[4:23:27] <%SirKeigan> Your loot game needs some improvement LUL
[4:23:30] <+Das_Prints> @pound_cake94 On the Re-45 it is great. On the Wingman it‚Äôs good until you find a Skullpiercer hop up which is straight better.
[4:23:31] <%GarbageNirvana> Ever since the post-HW stuff with the Warrior of Darkness he's had...suspicions
[4:23:36] <xxshadowxx416> watch pat is like watch a child
[4:23:42] <%SirKeigan> go in the big circle thing
[4:23:50] <+glgzephyr> yeah who needs longbow ammo
[4:23:56] <+POUND_CAKE94> @Das_Prints Understood big thx!
[4:23:56] <+glgzephyr> we don't shoot that gun
[4:24:08] <+Das_Prints> @pound_cake94 No problem!
[4:24:20] <+POUND_CAKE94> I love the RE-45 dood
[4:24:38] <+Das_Prints> It‚Äôs solid.
[4:24:46] <+POUND_CAKE94> Red R-99 was something special too
[4:25:08] <+POUND_CAKE94> or Pink???
[4:25:19] <xxshadowxx416> no
[4:25:24] <+glgzephyr> there are shots being fired on the map, go figure
[4:25:28] <+Das_Prints> Heirloom rarity is red.
[4:25:33] <ItIsSky> yeah, crate r-99 was wild
[4:25:54] <+Das_Prints> Care package Devotion was also a monster.
[4:25:58] <ItIsSky> but I always kind of didn't like it in early/mid game
[4:26:04] <xxshadowxx416> shoot left and right
[4:26:17] <+POUND_CAKE94> Yes CP Devotion has been my fave Apex experience to this day
[4:26:24] <huskarl_zap> The one thing I dont like about titanfall is alot of their guns look like the vector
[4:26:33] <xxshadowxx416> use ears
[4:26:48] <+POUND_CAKE94> good punch, in all honesty
[4:26:49] <pelonsinvalle> sick
[4:26:50] <%Taisuru> I finished the new FFXIV patch MSQ last night, yo that shit was gooooooood.
[4:26:53] <%ZephynM> Ah yes. The classic teammate who fucked off to die trying to be rambo.
[4:27:03] <$RealThiele> teamwork
[4:27:11] <Aydarkzero> ye
[4:27:25] <%ZephynM> This game is great, but it is pretty hard to get into sometimes with random people. imo
[4:27:33] <+POUND_CAKE94> I had fun watching you did well
[4:27:34] <Aydarkzero> what happened on Ghost Runner?
[4:27:37] <+Das_Prints> It was fun to watch.
[4:27:43] <%MechArch> ghost who?
[4:27:45] <%wibbwobbler> psaDab
[4:27:46] <$RealThiele> disc room
[4:27:50] <+glgzephyr> @ZephynM I feel like most BR games fit that description
[4:28:09] <Profmcstevie> What if....we just ran Titanfall 2 campaign on various difficulties instead of Apex Kappa
[4:28:14] <+POUND_CAKE94> I bought Hades today b/c of this guy and woolz lol and sure enough the game is tiiiight
[4:28:24] <%ZephynM> Yeah, but I feel that Apex is at least fun to play for me. It has the best movement and weapons I think.
[4:28:29] <+glgzephyr> yeah Hades is GOTY contender
[4:28:34] <%Taisuru> APex 2 spooky
[4:28:35] <+Das_Prints> @zephynm There‚Äôs definitely a learning curve but once it clicks and you start getting matched with people who know how to play as a team it‚Äôs been one of my favorite games for the past year or so.
[4:28:39] <%Spydurman> ever gonna finish Signifier on stream?
[4:28:44] <+POUND_CAKE94> Cant wait for Visage good luck
[4:28:48] <+max_radical> did patri' boivo' not enjoy ghostrunner?
[4:28:49] <%ZephynM> Oooo, I do hope to be here on time for Visage.
[4:28:53] <$RealThiele> its returning to its people
[4:28:56] <%ssjklyco> What happened with ghost runner? I was not here
[4:29:02] <%StaceMcGate> @PatStaresAt what about Disc room?
[4:29:04] <%MechArch> show bo and visage
[4:29:06] <%Ixiah> Ixiah subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 22 months! 22 Rolls and everytime i get this 1 Star Goblin..is this a scam ?

[4:29:17] <AFlyingTaco1> Oh boy can't wait to shit my pants for that
[4:29:18] <+glgzephyr> I should probably play Judgement
[4:29:20] <%Taisuru> I still need to finish 5 and up
[4:29:38] <+glgzephyr> damn
[4:29:44] <%BinaryFireball> the gameplay is aight
[4:29:44] <+POUND_CAKE94> PS4 only yeah?
[4:29:48] <%torontototoro> @PatStaresAt you probably haven't played it long enough to form an opinion, but who's your favourite character in Apex Legends?
[4:29:48] <%wibbwobbler> planning on tackling yakuza soon
[4:29:49] <@SoFarFetched> yeah PS4 only
[4:29:52] <%ZephynM> I was finally able to buy a Switch since I got a job. One of the first games I bought is Astral Chain because of when I watched you play some of it.
[4:29:54] <%BinaryFireball> yup
[4:29:56] <%Jekado> most combat in yakuza is meh
[4:29:59] <%Ranryu692> and no karaoke
[4:30:08] <%Jekado> yeah i heard the tailing missions are really bad
[4:30:08] <+max_radical> tailing missions have always sucked ass
[4:30:08] <+glgzephyr> I mean, the other yakuza games also had terrible tailing missions
[4:30:10] <xxshadowxx416> are goiung to play dragon
[4:30:15] <%ssjklyco> Did you get an early Yakuzies code?
[4:30:18] <+BionicPulga> Main guy ain't no Kiryu either.
[4:30:20] <Profmcstevie> A lot of the detective stuff feels really half baked
[4:30:26] <xanerts> combat is better than 6 tho
[4:30:35] <+Das_Prints> Do they still nail the humor like other Yakuza titles?
[4:30:44] <%BinaryFireball> I have a crush on his ex-yakuza sidekick
[4:30:51] <black_mages_matter_> that didnt rhyme
[4:30:53] <$RealThiele> hes punching the drugs out of them
[4:30:57] <%BinaryFireball> and his paisely swag
[4:30:59] <El_GhostV1> I agree
[4:31:01] <%Ixiah> LUL
[4:31:03] <%ZephynM> I was drinking when I wrote that, it sounded funny to me at the time.
[4:31:06] <+max_radical> @ssjklyco i believe he was crying on the podcast about no early copy
[4:31:12] <xxshadowxx416> haha
[4:31:19] <%CopperTucker> oh shit

[4:36:02] <%GarbageNirvana> Did they ever figure out what was going on with her?
[4:36:03] <%Fooguwu> @Grandma_Amari Denmark I think. They won't be able to contain it either. So we're likely dealing with 2 strains with different vaccines required
