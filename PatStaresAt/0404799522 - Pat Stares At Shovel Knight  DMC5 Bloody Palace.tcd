[0:03:09] <%Dr00_PhD> Yo
[0:03:12] <%nameless_majin> how far has everyone made it in Bloody Palace? I'm in level 60 right now with Dante
[0:03:13] <%DirtyGaijin> got us some knight of the shovel first
[0:03:16] <%spiritofmojave> Bloody Shovel
[0:03:17] <gustavozxd> after shovel Knight

[0:03:27] <%Ascethetic> 19 as V, im super rusty
[0:03:31] <%Piemen99> Knight palace
[0:03:36] <gustavozxd> I'm at 98 or something
[0:03:38] <blackjackskellington> 60 with Dante is my farthest. On 55 w/ Nero rn
[0:03:39] <sileo_patronus> Shovel Palace
[0:03:43] <%PaladinDupre> @AngriestPat thank you for streaming Pat. I've been going through some shit that boils down to waiting for big stuff and not being able to do anything about it but wait and thats hard. Your streams are a nice time sink and a distraction from the pain of waiting.
[0:03:47] <BoneofMalkav> Bloody Shovel Palace Knight
[0:03:50] <Johker> Is there a Pat Stares At clan in Warframe?
[0:03:57] <~AngriestPat> no ptob paladins
[0:03:58] <sileo_patronus> @BoneofMalkav perfect
[0:04:02] <%Ascethetic> Goliath kick my shit in
[0:04:06] <%PaladinDupre> <3
[0:04:06] <Johker> I just started like two-three weeks ago and I'm so addicted it hurts
[0:04:06] <%spiritofmojave> I can't get past the cavalier fight besides with Dante
[0:04:07] <%Tucker0603> @ascethetic but I just NEED Aettir Lux and Priwen Lux, they're orange glowing, it's literally my color.
[0:04:08] <%GoldeNOVA> We need some more Warframe streams... but only if that doesn't push back VTMB!
[0:04:23] <%lewdskeletor13> Inb4 this stream is an April Fools day prank apatSmug
[0:04:24] <%nameless_majin> anyone who's made it far in BP with Nero can anyone reccomend any crowd control moves or breakers?
[0:04:25] <gustavozxd> NO PTOB
[0:04:32] <42nfl19> @AngriestPat Did you know that if you hold the Gunslinger button while you have the Double Kalina Ann, you will actually drop one? So if you wanted to you can do single rocket combos. Then you can pick it up again.
[0:04:32] <SoushinSen> this music is so suitable for "intermission"
[0:04:32] <Bigfattycat> Got level 55 as v so far, I'm a complete scrub with nero and I blew it at level 40 with dante
[0:04:34] <%imadoc91> So question, does "Ne le laissez pas š'installer" illicit that delicious existential dread, or is it utter gibberish and not at all what I want to say?
[0:04:36] <%DirtyGaijin> @lewdskeletor13 don't tempt fate

[0:04:41] <%Kirby_Sauce> cheer500 DO NOT READ OUT LOUD: If you want, rather than have to search my donations for memetic bullshit, I could link you a doc and you can pre-approve them beforehand, and when I donate, you just grab something from the doc? DO READ OUT LOUD: you see that final Donation sniper joe left the other day? Do it. Watch it in spite of me.
[0:04:48] <%Ascethetic> @tucker0603 keep pressing on, man. i gave up before light farming
[0:04:50] <gustavozxd> good luck fighting 3 fury with V LUL
[0:04:54] <Johker> @AngriestPat I took your advice as a noob in Warframe and went with Rhino. Good choice it's def carried me since he's pretty much unkillable.
[0:04:55] <%Zamorouskiwhich> apatDab
[0:04:58] <%lewdskeletor13> WE CAN READ IT KIRBY
[0:05:01] <Johker> TY for that.

[0:05:26] <raven_frame> I see Pat’s been working up a sweat on Twitter.
[0:05:26] <Nina96> I read it out loud

[0:05:31] <42nfl19> Do you have to beat bloody palace in one go?
[0:05:34] <Johker> Oh I def feel lost.
[0:05:37] <42nfl19> TO get the taunt unlocks?

[0:05:55] <Master_Moridin> So having not been looking in on any coverage of it, what do y'all think the overer on Vergil being unlockable in Bloody Palace?
[0:06:03] <42nfl19> Not unlockable
[0:06:07] <%SrG00SE> apatRaffle
[0:06:08] <%lewdskeletor13> Vergil is not in it
[0:06:09] <%Tucker0603> @ascethetic thank you my man, I'm certainly never doing this again after I get the weapons I desire...unless the Shadowbringers ones are something I want and aren't fucking abysmal to get

[0:06:26] <Johker> Feels like leveling up in WoW and just kinda waiting for the end game stuff which I think is Ediolon stuff...?
[0:06:30] <%imadoc91> 50$ says vergil and co-op bloody palace come later
[0:06:31] <%lewdskeletor13> Did y’all see the actor for Vergil do the dummy thicc meme?
[0:06:41] <%spiritofmojave> hell yes

[0:10:55] <%Toynota10> @angriestpat you missed your chance to call this stream the I'm gonna show my feet stream
[0:10:56] <%GoldeNOVA> Stream is always muted for them
[0:10:57] <%Kirby_Sauce> cheer500 is Pat the april fool, or am I? I like the shitty bit thing going on. Sometimes I like to play the song "I hate myself for loving you" on speakers at home, but whenever it gets to the "for loving you" part, I just mute it, so the song goes "I hate myself " followed by 2-3 seconds of awkward, empty silence.
[0:10:59] <%ElenaManetta> Which is getting better over time
[0:10:59] <Alseid> @kylejefferies depends on the wheels

[0:21:56] <$BunkusFreskie> okay but what about accessibility
[0:21:58] <SchroedingersFerret> Selecting easy mode should just close out the game and load up Minecraft.

[0:24:13] <Ner234> 9000IQ Woolie
[0:24:14] <+TDotGoat> just don't talk to Woolie about video games, or anime, or movies...

[0:24:16] <%ScreamingMeat> Just lie!
[0:24:19] <derekwst3> did you beat bloody palace?
[0:24:20] <TheBlankAce> Yeah, you had no choice when you told him the divergence point for V was his last mission
[0:24:21] <raven_frame> Maybe you shouldn’t have played ahead of him.
[0:24:21] <%Laecerelius> Woolie's literally trying to spoil himself!
[0:24:22] <CaptainFrankincense> @AngriestPat just say Im not going to tell you to every question
[0:24:24] <%DirtyGaijin> there was a moment in an episode you had to catch yourself when almost talking about the devil sword dante
[0:24:25] <Nina96> @AngriestPat i say "dont worry about that"
[0:24:26] <%GohanEgret> @Shadicara But Woolie WILL figure it out!

[0:25:12] <%Konquerer> the only good response is don't worry about it
[0:25:15] <%ScreamingMeat> @AngriestPat No seriously just lie to him. I would have told him it was Mundus or some shit

[0:35:54] <%StEmlosWater> @ScreamingMeat Yeah pretty much. An easy example is the latin word for "slave", which is "servus", pronounced "sehr-whoos". The W is Germanic/Gaulic in origin IIRC.

[0:54:46] <%AncelDeLambert> D&D is insane and has awful combat YEAH I SAID IT
[0:54:48] <kylejefferies> Baulders Gate = 1000 menues to add 1 buff.

[0:54:54] <%dukenux> But yeah, it acutally get worse the further in game you are
[0:54:55] <%spiritofmojave> Baldur's Gate 2 is buff city, MH is like a couple minutes before going out on hunt

[0:55:29] <%Laecerelius> Real D&D has fine combat because it's tactical. D&D game combat tends to be an annoying slog that ingores most of D&D's combat rules.

[1:00:50] <%Kirby_Sauce> cheer500 So, as a bit of an explanation as to why I am like I am, here's a gamenalogy: On character creation, I got hit by a bug that caused my charisma to become a negative stat on spawn. To any glance at my stats, my charisma is normal, but on any rolls or checks, it acts as a negative value. It is SO BAD, that dialogue with me causes confusion and frenzy buildup, and SANITY damage on crits. I wouldn't be suprised if in a few years (and I'm still alive) me talking would inflict poison too.

[1:14:44] <%konekoryugamine> Dude you wanna heal
[1:14:49] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> @Buttku Well, Shovel Knight's a fairly linear platformer, akin to Mega Man. Hollow Knight is a content-packed metroidvania with much less durection for where to go. Really depends on which you'd enjoy more
[1:14:53] <+Plankman> @extradopeness All computers
[1:14:56] <+valkuma> eldritchhorrortwitchchat woah nice fucking dwarf fortress emote
[1:14:58] <joylent_blue> probably what i like most about BP is being able to fight Cavaliere Angelo and Cerberus as Nero, and Artemis and Goliath as Dante, its neat
[1:15:15] <%DirtyGaijin> this music tho
[1:15:18] <%Polarix64> I bought Hollow Knight but haven't played it yet, need to get on to it but not sure if I do it first or after I play Shantae Half Genie Hero since it's the only Shantae game that I haven't completed yet
[1:15:19] <coreybom> @plankman You joke, But DmC bp is actually pretty rad. it adds different kind of environmental stuff through out.
[1:15:22] <%konekoryugamine> @Valentinius_Anodyne I can agree, Hollow Knight doesn't outright tell you where to go as much as it's you learn your limits and what abilities you need to get to new areas.
[1:15:24] <Vashido22> @joylent_blue goliath as Dante is a blast

[1:20:01] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @Seitine Think that has to do with pelvic nerves. It's a debate whether or not cats get sexual satisfaction from it. So, enjoy that food for thought.
[1:20:06] <gustavozxd> just play it on the GameShark mode
[1:20:08] <%spiritofmojave> I think that was a fake wall back there, on that topic LUL
[1:20:13] <%ilasper1> just check every pixel of every screen 4Head

[1:20:19] <Seitine> So he is a kinky cat LUL
[1:20:25] <leviathan666303> just play on assist mode
[1:20:29] <%thackattack00> just turn on assist mode and sit there wordlessly for the entire stream while the game plays itself, then claim that it didn't hurt your experience at all
[1:20:35] <%skizzuto> play it off-stream and use a guide for anything you miss
[1:20:56] <%skizzuto> it's a good game even without the hidden stuff
[1:20:56] <%Polarix64> It's on my list especially since I've played other games by Matt Thorman back when he was making freeware flash games like Jumper so yeah Celeste is on my list of games to play

[1:22:41] <%spiritofmojave> didn't do on stream didn't happen
[1:22:44] <gustavozxd> you didn't stream so it didn't happen at all
[1:22:45] <SunsetJack> Was the reward decent from the Monk Quest?
[1:22:46] <RoboXGP> I gathered all the hidden items in Sekiro and never got the endings because I didn't eat Rice or Eavsdrop
[1:22:46] <+megamanx74> so...why do people want @AngriestPat to play celest?
[1:22:53] <%Keeble24> How do you even get that
[1:22:55] <%Keeble24> WOW
[1:22:58] <%starotter70> Answer the question!
[1:22:59] <rosemon5001> ohhh what did you get for completeing it right way?
[1:23:00] <deafmutelaughing> @AngriestPat I've ruined entire games for myself because the goblin needed me to get ALL THE THINGS, it's infuriating
[1:23:00] <%Keeble24> didnt know you can do that

[1:23:05] <+peri_d0t> @megamanx74 it's good
[1:23:07] <rufus2k2> @megamanx74 tight platforming = delicious frustration
[1:23:12] <%DirtyGaijin> we know the truth
[1:23:22] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat "Stream it for at least 1000 people, or it doesn't count." -AngriestPat, March 26th, 2019
[1:23:23] <b_ikki> it's just popular
[1:23:23] <gustavozxd> you can't say you did something without having video footage of it
[1:23:24] <%El_Desperad0> cause they have bad taste
[1:23:24] <%Deekman> I found super meat boy better
[1:23:25] <Megapikman132> Celeste is great.
[1:23:25] <caol2017> soundtrack
[1:23:27] <+CharredChord> I like Celeste
[1:23:28] <leviathan666303> its a fun game
[1:23:30] <Ner234> It's a HIDDEN GEM Kappa
[1:23:34] <%spiritofmojave> I haven't played it before even though it's in my library
[1:23:35] <+peri_d0t> @angriestpat it's just a solid game
[1:23:35] <Scruffy_Neckbeard> @AngriestPat I think it's better than SMB, honestly. Tight controls, AMAZING level design.
[1:23:35] <+megamanx74> odd
[1:23:36] <+mobius_won> The soundtrack is godlike
[1:23:37] <RoboXGP> It reminds me of Fez but with less puzzles more action
[1:23:37] <%ElenaManetta> Yeah it's a challenging platformer with a story
[1:23:39] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @deafmutelaughing my goblins destroyed Skyrim forever. Have to go into every cave and scrounge
[1:23:42] <%Polarix64> I feel like I have to do all the sidequests and get all the secrets, especially in indie games and man does it take me long to finish games because of it
[1:23:44] <%skizzuto> It's a really really good platformer, that's reason enough

[1:37:33] <natebud> If you use an oily rag your controller cna never get oily by your own hands
[1:37:34] <$Kefbar> get cleaning wipes with alcohol that helps the most
[1:37:34] <RoboXGP> the germs are still there, they're just dead
[1:37:34] <%3xgilly> pat needs to keep the controller away from all the earth litter

[1:43:34] <JWalnut> why not designate your time during one shower
[1:43:35] <SentientHoodie> Isn't that what Japan does? Clean yourself off then enjoy a bath?
[1:43:36] <%ElenaManetta> @Dio_TR It would wash the shit off but soap would get rid of the smell and disinfect you

[1:43:39] <%lewdskeletor13> So we’re getting to Bloody Palace tonight huh? Kappa @angriestpat

[1:43:39] <+Bloodxb> thats Wasting water
[1:43:40] <AlasterAngelo> @DirtyGaijin maybe if you're in California
[1:43:40] <Zteck123> Humans are made up of like 60% water, so the more you shower, the stronger you get
[1:43:41] <crimsonascend> I guess in that way two showers make sense.
[1:43:41] <starotter70> I love showers but that ain't right
[1:43:42] <Turbocommand> so just take a BETTER SHOWER THE FIRST TIME!!!
[1:43:46] <%DirtyGaijin> @Remery_ victory lap LUL
[1:43:48] <%ElenaManetta> You can still come out of the shower smelling like shit if you don't use soap or shampoo
[1:43:55] <%spiritofmojave> you're both crazy, you can have both comfort and hygiene at once. that's better

[1:44:37] <%The_Esquana> take two 20 minute showers or combine them into one 40 minute shower
[1:44:38] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> it. IT DOES. NOTHING.
[1:44:38] <AlasterAngelo> don't shampoo both times that's how you lose your hair

[1:51:35] <%lewdskeletor13> Elmo May Cry
[1:51:37] <%GarbageNirvana> Fun Fact: The NES games that gave you a black background for larger boss-type enemies like that did so because sprite limitations meant they had to make it as a background
[1:51:40] <$RaikenTB> @seaearthandsky Fair enough.
[1:51:41] <deafmutelaughing> yeah only Pat can do that

[1:53:15] <%lewdskeletor13> Pat is LITERALLY Danny Devito in that one Sunny episode
[1:53:17] <+linSP> pure moisture is inorganic though
[1:53:18] <$cosmicteapots> How do you define 'clean' Pat?
[1:53:20] <xIgnitionCrowx> So, you don't want to be just clean. You want to be zestfully clean?
[1:53:20] <%fallen92x> fallen92x subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 15 months! 
[1:53:21] <ShichiNoBushi> Use Zest. Because you aren't fully clean unless you are Zestfully clean.™
[1:53:24] <%Jetsfantasy> But we're told to drink milk moisture to improve our dry bones
[1:53:26] <%TheQButton> It's about the FEELING of cleanliness.
[1:53:29] <%street_sign> so you dont have to be clean just feel clean?
[1:53:33] <Huntercd> Where is Paige?
[1:53:34] <mleebee> What happens when you get sweaty tho

[1:54:29] <%TheQButton> Those spikes are probably not clean though.
[1:54:30] <blue6sub6remnant6> Chat willfully misunderstanding things is Chat's M.O. though.
[1:54:30] <$Brother_Coduss> you are anything BUT rational
[1:54:30] <%Profbathrobe> does the gold recovery system in this game make it a Soulslike technically?

[1:55:13] <%MagickBurritoh> Pat is the bed bug
[1:55:13] <%GeneralSCPatton> cheer500 Pat, have you considered embarking on the path to become a Psion Uncarnate? With discipline, and 10 levels in a prestige class, you could shed your entire physical form and become an entity of pure consciousness.
[1:55:14] <%Laecerelius> Pat's already mentioned this
[1:55:15] <%gus_hornblende> Pat's train of thought on being clean are about as sound as a Jojo episode
[1:55:16] <+JackMillerTime> they also like made beds
[1:55:18] <RoboXGP> they eat your cotton
[1:55:21] <ligerglare> i hate bedbugs
[1:55:22] <%blastazoid26> @AngriestPat Would you take immortality for exchange of having to use a colostomy bag?
[1:55:24] <%spiritofmojave> Shovel Knight is already Pat's BP

[1:55:28] <ligerglare> they make you itch baaad
[1:55:30] <Skullamancer> Just suck out all the moisture
[1:55:31] <%ScreamingMeat> @Monkeyweed21 Pat said he'd become a toilet if he'd live forever. SO I assume having immortality worms would be great for him
[1:55:33] <%Deekman> it's basically the plot of Sekiro
[1:55:34] <DraxTD> simi infini dager!
[1:55:36] <%waterbuddy16> more than being gross, bedbugs are fucking awful to try and get rid of
[1:55:38] <+JackMillerTime> naw but they like to bite you as you sleep
[1:55:39] <%Polarix64> Those helicopter enemies that push you into bottomless pits are complete assholes man

[1:56:19] <$NocturneNovember> Isn't dry Red Bull just cocaine?
[1:56:19] <%lewdskeletor13> Don’t read One Piece

[2:12:48] <%AbnormalVoid> BECAUSE YOU NEVER USE IT
[2:12:49] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Like you ran out of ammo in that Remake 2 run?
[2:12:49] <Djinnazz> The goblins again.
[2:12:50] <%brickwall35> you'd need to be good for that to be a problem
[2:12:52] <%korth367> i fucking can't
[2:12:54] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@mr_slaide) (warning)
[2:12:56] <%skizzuto> but then you get to the next checkpoint without having used it at all so clearly you never will need it
[2:12:56] <%graffitisamurai> Then you die.
[2:12:57] <+RC_S3kshun8> @AngriestPat one could argue you needed it if not using it causes you to die
[2:12:59] <powerprotoman> but yuoll eb dead and thus have have never needed it
[2:12:59] <$hatesdps> but the dubbl jump
[2:13:01] <bigbradish> Quit hoarding the refillable resource
[2:13:01] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> oh wait, you didn't
[2:13:02] <%JJCheeker> Can't you upgrade magic more
[2:13:02] <mr_slaide> But he only has 85 of them!
[2:13:06] <blackjackskellington> Then get to the checkpoint without it or die with your knowledge of what’s coming up
[2:13:08] <Turbocommand> why even have the ability in the first place???
[2:13:11] <ScrubTheNerd> But if you never use it, you might as well have not had it
[2:13:14] <%pabstblueriven> Upgrade your magic!
[2:13:16] <%rytyoung> but you get so much mana tho
[2:13:21] <%Freelance7> COOP WITH EMLO
[2:13:22] <%spiritofmojave> "What if I really need it" [refills with basically every other enemy]
[2:13:23] <$hatesdps> err flippy jump
[2:13:27] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> C'mon Pat, play Co-op with yourself
[2:13:28] <%Kirby_Sauce> cheer500 you heard the man chat! Pat lavishly moisturizes his feet, but refuses to show them to us! Between that and the attention he draws to Paige's ugly boots, Pat isn't into feet in the same way Plauge isn't into furry stuff. On a related note: is all of Pat's sex kinky by default of the fact that he has to use IMPLIMENTS (his stilts)
[2:13:31] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Who uses sub weapons on these games? The weaknesses trivialize bosses in Megaman if you use them
[2:13:31] <crimsonascend> Is Elmo trying to be Player 2?
[2:13:38] <%DirtyGaijin> sekiro?
[2:13:39] <%Konquerer> this is how you end up with 500 rocket launchers at the end of a game
[2:13:44] <%graffitisamurai> Pat your logic is as circular as you are short
[2:13:45] <%AbnormalVoid> YOU NEED IT NOW
[2:13:46] <Nina96> BUT U STILL NEVER USE IT
[2:13:48] <+nooseygoosey> he is aware of how broken of a person he is
[2:13:52] <%masked_hero_lucky> Notice that the potions heal your MAGIC too, there's literally no reason to be so conservitive with your magic
[2:13:52] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Beat the game then you can use it
[2:13:53] <mr_slaide> We haven't seen Paige's ugly boots in a while.
[2:13:54] <MissMalisin> SourPls
[2:13:55] <+asgard147> SourPls
[2:13:55] <%spiritofmojave> You never need it
[2:13:56] <NickHatesSnow> It's not that type of game
[2:13:57] <+RC_S3kshun8> @AngriestPat but don't you really need it if not using it causes you to die?
[2:13:58] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> @AngriestPat obligitory YOU REALLY NEED IT NOW
[2:13:58] <Polengoldur> @AngriestPat you lost 1200 gold. how much more could you have possibly needed it??

[2:30:50] <+Anonylesssss> @Cervantas he means at the end
[2:30:50] <+ahdurian> i thought you cant kill MrX
[2:30:52] <$RaikenTB> I killed X with about 20 bullets. The adaptive difficulty makes hoarding pointless.
[2:30:54] <%Cervantas> oh
[2:30:54] <fruit_pie_the_magician> And you wound up with enough ammo to kill him five times
[2:30:55] <OldOnyx> He mean the timed Mr.X fight?
[2:30:55] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> @waifoong98 I feel personally attacked by this
[2:31:05] <Graywolf_the_45th> You can kill mr x with 0 ammo
[2:31:07] <+MaxeusTheFirst> Good rain tip.
[2:31:09] <%Toynota10> @angriestpat what happens if you run out of ammo in the B campaign against Birkin on the train?
[2:31:09] <Mr_Strut> It's time!
[2:31:10] <+soopahtoast> YOU DID IT
[2:31:10] <disister1201> despite having TONS of ammo
[2:31:10] <%AmaniIsYourBoss> Vergil 3
[2:31:10] <Nina96> @Cervantas more like disable temporally
[2:31:10] <reonome> last boss you dinguses
[2:31:11] <%waifoong98> @Valentinius_Anodyne what kind of monster are you LUL
[2:31:13] <%gus_hornblende> @waifoong98 i had a friend refuse to use items in MonHun because he didn't want to waste resources
[2:31:14] <gustavozxd> shadow hearts taught me to actually use items, that game gets fucking hard man
[2:31:16] <%spiritofmojave> I'll give a pass because RE2 is a shit load of hording to begin with, but still
[2:31:16] <+mik255> is black knight a good vergil?

[2:31:32] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> @waifoong98 An inefficient one LUL
[2:31:32] <$RaikenTB> @Toynota10 I did with 10 bullets and the knife. The game scales to help you.
[2:31:33] <Huntercd> That pissed me off, even with all Pats' mind goblins he still had plenty of ammo and did much better than I

[2:34:46] <%Polarix64> @Niney_Who Eh that would only be the case if you made it so everyone but the Enchantress and Shield Knight didn't swap genders, since this is full genderswap however they're still straight
[2:34:48] <Chester_goes_Berserk> I feel like this game punishes the hoarding philosophy
[2:34:51] <%enickma11> @JonnyCue Yeah it was a random DLC add on that gender swaps everyone. Really fun!
[2:34:51] <%Cervantas> Look at those 2d table hoppers

[2:40:52] <lizard0tm> @AngriestPat I mean, it's almost like this game was designed with item use in mind
[2:40:55] <+awesomeguy423> @riantDeliration it's easier than it looks
[2:40:59] <joylent_blue> Freelance7 he refuses to heal and chat is having fits
[2:41:01] <+MaxeusTheFirst> I enjoyed my time playing it when it came out.
[2:41:01] <%StEmlosWater> @joylent_blue WTF has Capcom DONE to me that the DMC5 has been out less than a full month and I feel like I fucking NEED Vergil

[2:41:09] <+awesomeguy423> @lizard0tm there is an achievement for beating the game shovel only
[2:41:10] <+zaworldo> @AngriestPat Maybe they put items in the game so you would USE THEM
[2:41:11] <%waifoong98> just throw fire ball Kappa
[2:41:13] <+awesomeguy423> so it's possible
[2:41:13] <lloyddboy> is he still saving his magic
[2:41:15] <ligerglare> you can refill that fish goo
[2:41:17] <+keyoray> @Freelance7 dead, many, many, many times

[2:42:06] <%JenovasPuppet> God damn it, Pat!
[2:42:08] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> You're not going to convince us
[2:42:08] <%Dr00_PhD> You'd be in the same place as you are now
[2:42:08] <Jolly_Adventurer> You have 97 of them
[2:42:08] <Shortnamer> Then at least stop jumping into his big attacks LUL
[2:42:08] <powerprotoman> imagine lying to yourself like this

[2:42:23] <ligerglare> pat pls
[2:42:28] <%lewdskeletor13> Foolishness Shovel Knight, Foolishness. Consumables control everything, and without them, you can’t protect anything, let alone yourself
[2:42:29] <Skullamancer> Youre at the end of the mission you can go back and get more
[2:42:30] <marvel877> Have you considered using the Locket?
[2:42:31] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> If you don't use the healing item, you WILL lose
[2:42:32] <rosemon5001> @AngriestPat you would literally only need to go back to the pond to refill lazy
[2:42:32] <ligerglare> dont give us this mental terrorism
[2:42:32] <Megapikman132> @AngriestPat Use the items. You can replenish them immediately after this boss fight

[2:42:45] <mr_slaide> Calm down you overweight nerds.
[2:42:46] <T_Sasquatch> he is going to either give up OR he will slam his head against this until he does
[2:42:46] <Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> also not using the items means he has to get good at the fight
[2:42:47] <Darthkitten_Prime> HOW
[2:42:49] <%BioApple> Also do you REALLY think you can use up two full heals and still die? You can basically facetank every boss with that
[2:42:49] <%filialpails> it's not a waste if you win!
[2:42:50] <televisedrevolting> GODDAMIT PAT
[2:42:50] <+zaworldo> FOR THE LOVE OF FUCK
[2:42:51] <+HelveticaScenario> What is the point of hoarding something you're never going to use?
[2:42:52] <ligerglare> sub weapons pat
[2:42:52] <ameraaaaaa> you keep them
[2:42:52] <$ooblagis> How will you be in a worse place? You're not using them EVER, so you already don't have healing items
[2:42:52] <%waifoong98> Just use items then reeee, you regain mana after death anw
[2:42:53] <Mr_Strut> It's not a waste if it serves a purpose
[2:42:54] <joylent_blue> guys, he's saving the heals for THE RUN
[2:42:55] <Nina96> @extradopeness chats right though
[2:42:55] <Clyderso> just dodge 4Head
[2:42:56] <%JJCheeker> Only use it when the boss is lower in health
[2:42:56] <%Dr00_PhD> use it on a good run then
[2:42:56] <thecrazyestminer> I particularly understand but if you use them you win chance gets way higher
[2:42:58] <powerprotoman> we are and your crazy
[2:42:58] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> DO YOU WASTE ESTUS? HoW
[2:42:58] <ligerglare> y u no use sub weapons
[2:42:59] <deafmutelaughing> Pat are you kidding me
[2:43:00] <Darthkitten_Prime> I give up
[2:43:00] <IronGlorfindel> Pat this IS "later"
[2:43:02] <%brickwall35> HEAL
[2:43:02] <SchroedingersFerret> Just do it good
[2:43:02] <+zaworldo> J E S U S
[2:43:03] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> can this be
[2:43:04] <ameraaaaaa> after death iirc
[2:43:04] <%brickwall35> HE'S HALF LIFE
[2:43:05] <%Freelance7> YOU'RE NOT LISTENING
[2:43:05] <blue6sub6remnant6> You get a level break between now and second tower level do you not? Or is the boss rush immediately after DarkKnight2?
[2:43:05] <+zaworldo> THIS IS LATER
[2:43:06] <DagetStreams> Defeating you like this...has no meaning
[2:43:07] <+keyoray> Pat you're the greatest! You be big and strong and use no items.
[2:43:07] <+Anonylesssss> @AngriestPat we are talking about your sub weapons not exlirs
[2:43:07] <%BioApple> esp. if you use that magic item that makes you invincible, since it refills your magic too
[2:43:09] <%lewdskeletor13> Foolishness Shovel Knight, Foolishness. Consumables control everything, and without them, you can’t protect anything, let alone yourself
[2:43:09] <Clyderso> USE ZAPPING SYSTEM
[2:43:10] <+zaworldo> LATER IS NOW
[2:43:10] <%graffitisamurai> By that logic you can NEVER use healing items
[2:43:10] <+Tokanova> @AngriestPat there won't be a later if you can't beat him
[2:43:11] <+LadyRarityV> just get good LUL
[2:43:12] <devanmuse> STOP SIDE EYEING CHAT when you're trying to focus on the boss fight
[2:43:12] <Rhinoprotoss> What if I need it??
[2:43:14] <%Polarix64> Also why not use the anchor Pat
[2:43:14] <%NWR_James> @AngriestPat Get on his head. I promise
[2:43:14] <+Grayhammatter> pat getting his ass greased i see
[2:43:16] <+zaworldo> YOU NEED THEM NOW
[2:43:17] <ligerglare> sub weapons paaat
[2:43:19] <gustavozxd> BUT IF YOU DON'T USE
[2:43:20] <%Tucker0603> fuck you and your goblins
[2:43:20] <deafmutelaughing> this is the April Fool's. We are all being gotten right now.
[2:43:20] <Caidezes> HOW CAN THIS BE, CHAT?
[2:43:21] <%brickwall35> Pat you aren't good enough horde
[2:43:22] <Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> let him learn the fight
[2:43:23] <Chester_goes_Berserk> Winning without items is an actual hardmode
[2:43:23] <Nina96> @AngriestPat u would win if u heal
[2:43:23] <%ElenaManetta> just give up
[2:43:24] <+zaworldo> YES
[2:43:24] <%spiritofmojave> I think both chat and Pat are on the same spectrum of stubbornness, but different views on reality LUL
[2:43:25] <+RC_S3kshun8> @AngriestPat we are, it's just if you never use the mechanics/items then they may as well not be in the game lol
[2:43:26] <ScrubTheNerd> Yeah no I'm completely with you on the health thing
[2:43:28] <%ArcanumMBD> Pat is actually right. He's fighting poorly, so if he were to heal it would be a waste
[2:43:28] <worldbrand> i'm distracting you
[2:43:29] <%JJCheeker> If only these messages can go back in time apatJpeg
[2:43:29] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Waste your Estus flask
[2:43:30] <lizard0tm> Why does he jump into that attck everytime?
[2:43:30] <%Emperor_Machinus> How about the pendant?
[2:43:30] <$megamonmon123> good
[2:43:31] <Megapikman132> then at least use the items. You get all of your magic every time you die.
[2:43:31] <extradopeness> Omg STFU guys
[2:43:31] <ligerglare> atlast
[2:43:31] <vindaxxv> i actually agree with pat at least get the boss down to 30%

[2:43:34] <gustavozxd> if you don't use them at all then you ah you know waht
[2:43:35] <Skullamancer> At least use the pendant to avoid hits
[2:43:35] <Mr_Strut> Hows it feeeeeeel Pat?
[2:43:36] <%lewdskeletor13> Elena with the solid advice
[2:43:37] <televisedrevolting> A HEAL
[2:43:38] <%JenovasPuppet> See, if he had used his healing items there he wouldn't have died and that would have been a waste!
[2:43:41] <+AmanDotZip> when exactly are you gonna use them if you dont use aat low health
[2:43:43] <%GoldeNOVA> If you don't wanna use items, fine, then do it flawlessly without taking any damage! Kappa
[2:43:44] <%nmaten> maybe if you stopped jumping into everything you wouldnt need to heal Kappa
[2:43:46] <Mr_Strut> To be a bitch
[2:43:49] <+Grayhammatter> wow
[2:43:49] <%brickwall35> @vindaxxv he had the boss at 33%

I had a 20 min argument with my dad over whether insects were animals or not. When my brother hit his head in a wakeboarding accident, my aunt directed him to a bag of tylenol. Rather than take 1 or 2 per his weight, dumbass ate the whole baggie's worth.

[3:08:19] <%ArcanumMBD> @angriestpat but Pat your plan was to beat them without using items in case you needed them later, so being at that checkpoint with no items shouldn't matter

[3:09:35] <%Polarix64> Yeah but you didn't lose Pat so you're fine
[3:09:35] <powerprotoman> pat the key problem is that the hypotheticals you speak of Didnt happen
[3:09:38] <GreyHeartedHero> Just don't bring the items if you're gonna be pissy about using them
[3:09:38] <joylent_blue> you won't win this
[3:09:39] <+linSP> thats some logical fallacy innit
[3:09:39] <ChineseNininga> you never know
[3:09:42] <Reaperzod> Phaaaaaaaaaaaaaze loooooooovkeeeeeeeeet
[3:09:42] <derekwst3> just believe in yourself patty
[3:09:44] <ShichiNoBushi> I agree with Pat.
[3:09:45] <%Prevot> imagine not having items to not use because you used them
[3:09:49] <arcaderabbit48> Wait, shit, Pat is a Veteran at Monster Hunter. Don't you use items all the time in that game? How did he manage to do that for so long?? Like even ignoring ammo and arrow coatings, the potions and bombs and everything are all super useful and often times needed!
[3:09:53] <%daisyyyy> chat plz just stfu about items who actually cares
[3:09:53] <$megamonmon123> he makes sense but hordes too much
[3:09:55] <vindaxxv> but doesnt that logic imply that you need to use the items to win
[3:09:55] <$ESP_ROOT> monkaS
[3:09:57] <%nmaten> believe in the chat that believes in you pat

[3:10:03] <MissMalisin> monkaS
[3:10:04] <televisedrevolting> Regardless of how far you get, you will never use those goddamn items.
[3:10:04] <%meltdown547> If you don't ever *need* the items to beat an encounter, then by the other foot, it harms nothing in using them because you'll never *need* them to win the game.
[3:10:05] <+soopahtoast> u did it
[3:10:06] <+ahdurian> soimtimes Pat's logic...ugh
[3:10:06] <%riantDeliration> that felt like IWBTG lol

[3:17:32] <Coolbob444> have I forgotten the lore?
[3:17:32] <arcaderabbit48> @Aiden_Sylas_Storm I feel like that gets into the fundamental game design quesiton of items existing. If the game is meant to be completably without them, why do they exist? But if the items are needed to finish the game, that could lead to really bad game design if done poorly
[3:17:35] <%waifoong98> he is taking revenge for that time you drop him LUL

[3:21:17] <ligerglare> woof
[3:21:17] <ZComiX> Honestly @angriestpat philosophy isn’t wrong bc you should be able to beat any boss without items. Items should just be used to confirm a victory IF you REEEAALLLY need to.

[3:31:04] <%lewdskeletor13> @polarix64 Night
[3:31:09] <%GoldeNOVA> According to Dan Southworth, NEVER DIED
[3:31:11] <+SolverCODO> Vergil never died, he just half died twice
[3:31:11] <yaboiiunclephil> He’s in the van let me use him ffs
[3:31:17] <evbites> yeah he did like four times
[3:31:22] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Would Trish be better off with Alastor or Nevan?
[3:31:23] <+SolverCODO> wait no, Vergil half died three times at least
[3:31:26] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> 🤔
[3:31:26] <%lewdskeletor13> Vergil didn’t die in 1
[3:31:28] <joylent_blue> just like shadows, Vergil dies twice
[3:31:29] <%DirtyGaijin> i feel we will get a vergil dlc after ladies night
[3:31:29] <joylent_blue> Kappa
[3:31:32] <benjiFG> probably alastor
[3:31:32] <aimlesshealer> Vergil is one determined little bitch
[3:31:34] <%GoldeNOVA> Nah he was just tired
[3:31:35] <+SolverCODO> yeah wait, it's 4. 4 times
[3:31:36] <%spiritofmojave> he seems pretty dead as Nelo Angelo, but I'll believe Dan Southworth
[3:31:44] <%GoldeNOVA> Vergil just took a little nap
[3:31:46] <ShichiNoBushi> You think they'll ever release a Donte skin?
[3:31:48] <vVAstrAVv> nevan would suit trishs style
[3:31:49] <Nina96> y not both?
[3:31:50] <joylent_blue> Dan lore is best lore
[3:31:53] <evbites> POWER!
[3:31:59] <%dukenux> Vergil didn't die. He just showed middle finger to Dante and walked backwards to Hell
[3:32:05] <%lewdskeletor13> Nelo Angelo blows up every time you fight him, him blowing up in the last fight doesn’t mean he died
[3:32:10] <+SolverCODO> Vergil just gets ashy instead of dying, but then he's really uncomfortable and no amount of moisturizer will sate him
[3:32:17] <Aiden_Sylas_Storm> Vergil didn't die, I don't think, he just got *super* fucked, as you can see at the beginning of 5.
[3:32:18] <coreybom> @shichinobushi They kinda did in the form of the ex colors.
[3:32:19] <sileo_patronus> If you don't see a corpse then it's Schrodinger's death
[3:32:24] <%nameless_majin> Did Pat had to take the apatBig poo?
[3:32:27] <aimlesshealer> Playable Vergil should come with a Slap Chop weapon
[3:32:32] <%GoldeNOVA> Dante loses and takes a nap for a month, Vergil loses and takes a nap for a few years
[3:32:33] <%GoldeNOVA> It's fine
[3:32:35] <joylent_blue> vergil got the big torture
[3:32:35] <ShichiNoBushi> Never saw the Dante EX skin.
[3:32:39] <Nina96> @nameless_majin yes
[3:32:42] <benjiFG> would Vergil canonically have Beowulf?
[3:32:42] <+SolverCODO> Vergil got CBT
[3:32:44] <%waifoong98> How the fuck did he play old monhun then when you can't restock mid quest.
[3:32:47] <%Konquerer> ashy vergil is pats dream
[3:32:50] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> How far has everyone made it Bloody Palace so far? Made it to 98 with V on my first attempt. Every stage with a fury made me want to die.
[3:32:51] <vVAstrAVv> guys he DIED they just retconned it cus hes a fan fav
[3:32:52] <%BioApple> @verelme Not enough moisture? He should get a Sweet Surrender Kappa
[3:32:58] <joylent_blue> nah Dante got Beowulf after Vergil
[3:32:58] <Aiden_Sylas_Storm> If you play Dante and Vergil coop, you should be able to have rooms where you battle each other.
[3:33:00] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> I just realized Vergil didn't have his regular DT, even though they had it in the concept art
[3:33:00] <+feelgooddrag0ndragoon> wat i miss
[3:33:01] <lizard0tm> Dante EX skin sucks
[3:33:03] <$ESP_ROOT> god this song is amazing SourPls
[3:33:08] <+Grayhammatter> easily, stock up on things BEFORE you head out to quest
[3:33:10] <Nina96> @waifoong98 u can still make stuff in the zone
[3:33:11] <+SolverCODO> I like it but im a goth, so
[3:33:19] <+SolverCODO> his EX skin I mean
[3:33:21] <joylent_blue> Sphincter_Spelunker and his regular DT looks SICK
[3:33:24] <lloyddboy> what did Vergil say when he saw Sweet Surrender?
[3:33:25] <%waifoong98> @Nina96 yeah but like what if he forgot to switch gear and shit lol
[3:33:27] <%spiritofmojave> I hope if they bring Vergil back he gets Beouwulf again
[3:33:30] <vVAstrAVv> dante vergil co op better have a jackpot taunt
[3:33:30] <lizard0tm> Nero and Dante's EX skin are both awful but V's is pretty good
[3:33:35] <artoflec> im getting my ass kicked on floor 60 :elawut
[3:33:38] <artoflec> elaWut
[3:33:47] <Nina96> @waifoong98 true but pat isnt that bad
[3:33:47] <aimlesshealer> I always thought Vergil's DT looked like one of those medieval ladies with the poofy hair
[3:33:48] <joylent_blue> nah Nero's EX color is good, you can hardly tell his hair is different in most lights
[3:33:52] <+Bloodxb> neros ex is great
[3:33:53] <vVAstrAVv> neros ex dt is cooler tho
[3:34:04] <+SolverCODO> Nero's EX is Credo and that makes it pretty alright
[3:34:05] <lizard0tm> I'll agree to disagree
[3:34:05] <+awesomeguy423> man
[3:34:08] <benjiFG> Vergil buys Beowulf off of eBay after Dante sells it
[3:34:10] <%CerberusDriver> Dante'
[3:34:15] <+awesomeguy423> who does Dante's EX always have to be "FUCK YOU"
[3:34:19] <+Bloodxb> especially compared to his ex in 4
[3:34:23] <vVAstrAVv> his normal dt is criminally ugly imo
[3:34:30] <%CerberusDriver> Dante's EX skin doesn't look good with the black hair in this game, it looked fine in 4.

Stay rad, stay mad, and give no quarter.
[3:34:35] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @aimlesshealer LMAO There's a lady in Thw Witcher that has that hair. I know what you mean
[3:34:36] <Nina96> @vVAstrAVv whos?
[3:34:38] <joylent_blue> i like nero's DT just fine, but pvpSass
[3:34:40] <coreybom> @shichinobushi Its just don't colors.
[3:34:40] <%CerberusDriver> but black hair on DMC5 Dante is ech
[3:34:43] <+SolverCODO> I want Goth Daddy EX Dante to fuck me
[3:34:46] <evbites> i hope he has new weapons
[3:34:46] <%akingofnoobs> akingofnoobs subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! 
[3:34:49] <%lewdskeletor13> Dante sells his devil arms on E-Bay confirmed
[3:34:50] <+SolverCODO> but he doesnt know what sex is
[3:35:02] <%waifoong98> black hair, white stache and beard, makes sense
[3:35:03] <+Bloodxb> he does tho
[3:35:04] <%CerberusDriver> Dante thinks eating pizza with a girl is sex
[3:35:05] <benjiFG> loop
[3:35:08] <%spiritofmojave> Or Craigslist, one of the two
[3:35:14] <deathsmions1> if isnt?
[3:35:14] <%lewdskeletor13> Oh I know he sells them
[3:35:19] <Aiden_Sylas_Storm> I feel like DT is sort of half into demon form, where as the SIN DT is their full demon form.
[3:35:21] <+atlasbot1> what would happen if pat and plague fused and became one person?
[3:35:22] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @verelme That IS Credo 🤯
[3:35:28] <%lewdskeletor13> He kept Cerberus for years for some reason
[3:35:31] <joylent_blue> guys i'm on floor 95 of BP as Dante and i'm scared BibleThump
[3:35:33] <+SolverCODO> @CerberusDriver wait, what does that say about him eating pizza with Trish then
[3:35:36] <%GoldeNOVA> What is the best DMCV song and why is it Legacy?
[3:35:38] <lizard0tm> Nero's DT is literally his stand from DMC4 and I love that
[3:35:39] <DonatelloJose> @cerberusdriver wait. Then what IS sex?
[3:35:41] <vVAstrAVv> maybe dantes just attracted to demons. but theyre all busy being evil
[3:35:45] <Nina96> @joylent_blue good luck
[3:35:47] <%Reaped_Psyche> @lewdskeletor13 Dante can't keep the internet working in the building. He sells them on the "LetGo" app.
[3:35:48] <yaboiiunclephil> I wonder if they’ll ever give Nero a sin DT
[3:35:53] <%spiritofmojave> @GoldeNOVA Crimson Cloud grew on me a lot
[3:35:54] <joylent_blue> BibleThump 7
[3:35:58] <%waifoong98> also wow, fuck that Episode Ardyn shit, again with the "Spreading DE DARKNESS" PunOko

[3:36:34] <%lewdskeletor13> Foolishness Shovel Knight, Foolishness. Consumables control everything, and without them, you can’t protect anything, let alone yourself
[3:36:35] <%Kirby_Sauce> cheer500 nefarious runs off some weird amalgamation of games and adventure time. there's a hero, princess, and a villian society. They have leaders who go by the name of each group. (Justice, Virtue, and Malice respectively) crow only starts to win as a villain due to a combination of his awareness of the tropes of games and stories, and the negligence of his hero. Kinda reminds me of venture bros in a way. the liar princess and the blind prince is definitely a game paige should play.
[3:36:36] <DonatelloJose> Look at that Emlo
[3:36:36] <aimlesshealer> When you see the Elmo, you'll shit bricks

[3:37:12] <vVAstrAVv> i think the series has just been catching nero up to the sos. he wont surpass them

[3:37:30] <%CerberusDriver> @AngriestPat Do you think the voice actor of V should do audiobooks of William Blake poetry in his V voice. I'd buy those.

[3:37:53] <televisedrevolting> @cerberusdriver I'd buy those as gifts for friends.
[3:37:55] <lizard0tm> That would make me sploosh
[3:37:56] <joylent_blue> I WOULD PAY MONEY
[3:38:00] <joylent_blue> FOR THAT
[3:38:01] <lloyddboy> Bloody Blake?
[3:38:02] <%El_Desperad0> How's Paige?
[3:38:03] <%lewdskeletor13> I WOULD BUY THAT
[3:38:06] <Aiden_Sylas_Storm> Nero can't match Dante or Vergil, even their regular DTs. He just pulls an Arkham and punks Dante and Vergil in the middle of their fight. If you need a reference, Vergil and Dante had a no holds barred match for an hour, and then Nero does a run-in with a steel chair.
[3:38:07] <%spiritofmojave> Add an extra extra deluxe edition
[3:38:11] <%Iccirrus> There's a really good one in national harbor too!
[3:38:11] <%GoldeNOVA> Characters audiobooks should be a thing
[3:38:13] <Master_Moridin> @angriestpat curious, did you have as much of an issue with Transient Curse in Dark Souls as you did with the Divine Caffetti?
[3:38:14] <+Roundelay11> do you even have bbq in canada land?
[3:38:16] <%NopeBadguy> @AngriestPat Have you ever played the Gregory Horror Show game made by the Resident Evil team on the PS2?
[3:38:17] <Nina96> @AngriestPat have u ever played a mega man game?
[3:38:23] <+Nomicro4u> MOMO CON LOL
[3:38:26] <SailingSaturn> I'd be interested in it cirISee
[3:38:27] <ScreamingMeat> Maybe they could use the audio books to give V more than 3 lines to read
[3:38:27] <%spiritofmojave> I live a block away from a BBQ and bar, it's amazing
[3:38:30] <%dukenux> Red Dragon as Vs next summon
[3:38:30] <+skm742> @AngriestPat I had to tell myself 'but every mana up I consume at full mana is just wasted mana' before I managed to force myself to start using it.
[3:38:33] <%gojirarads> is that a picture of Steve buschime?
[3:38:36] <lizard0tm> I want Balrogs VA to do audio books too
[3:38:38] <joylent_blue> you hardly need transient curse
[3:38:39] <%brickwall35> let Elmo play Pat
[3:38:43] <%Aydarkzero> you could buy curse!
[3:38:45] <%brickwall35> he's eyeing the keyboard
[3:38:47] <%filialpails> transient rights!
[3:38:49] <%Toynota10> @angriestpat Which Vergil theme you like better? Vergil 2 (DMC3) or DMC5's Dante vs Vergil theme?
[3:38:52] <%BioApple> pat is always cursed so transient curses are redundant
[3:38:52] <%mastertwin2> Transient Curse drops like candy off the enemies you use it on
[3:38:52] <$onnoashee> How's things going Pat? You doing good?
[3:38:55] <+linSP> man ive only wasted one confetti
[3:38:56] <joylent_blue> you can also just run the fuck past those ghosts

[3:39:01] <ShichiNoBushi> Transient Curse dropped more frequently, and you can buy them relatively early.
[3:39:05] <%ElenaManetta> Say transient curse one more time
[3:39:07] <Darkrenai> Meanwhile in Sekiro you barely get any Confetti or they make you farm for it and by the time you are able to buy it you basically dont need it anymore
[3:39:07] <%lewdskeletor13> @gojirarads It’s Steve Buschellmo
[3:39:07] <+Nomicro4u> He kick!
[3:39:08] <%Aydarkzero> meanwhile in Sekiro it's like w/e
[3:39:10] <benjiFG> creepy ghost hand
[3:39:15] <%filialpails> transient curses are human curses
[3:39:16] <%gojirarads> ah ok
[3:39:17] <Zombrocom> Yeah confetti was a real odd decision
[3:39:18] <%CerberusDriver> @ElenaManetta dont you dare say it--
[3:39:19] <joylent_blue> ElenaManetta transient curse :)

[3:39:21] <%unclekulikov> When did you first notice consumable use causing you trouble? Would it have been Resident Evil 2 in 1998?
[3:39:22] <%mastertwin2> There are also weapons that negate ghost immunity
[3:39:23] <%waifoong98> ???
[3:39:26] <Jontman42> I took one look at the apparitions and went "yup, I'll leave that for after I can buy this shit"
[3:39:27] <$rdark_ksu> I want to eat pork ribs and burnt ends with you and Woolz in KC
[3:39:28] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Mrs. Obama get down
[3:39:30] <+Jordan_z123> Going from sekiro to dmc5 is like playing two different fighting games
[3:39:31] <%spiritofmojave> what type of curse again?
[3:39:36] <%mostundesired> He kic
[3:39:37] <aimlesshealer> What is your character doing with that weird ghost hand anyway? Wiping it on their face?
[3:39:37] <%Agami23> divine confetti would be better if there was a easy way to farm it early

[3:39:49] <arcaderabbit48> @AngriestPat Have you ever considered seeing someone about your OCD? It seems to cause you a lot of uneeded stress.
[3:39:49] <joylent_blue> what character you gonna run with pat PogChamp
[3:39:49] <%NopeBadguy> @AngriestPat Have you ever played the Gregory Horror Show game made by the Resident Evil team on the PS2?
[3:39:56] <OldOnyx> they even drop a cursed weapon often enough
[3:40:00] <%Aydarkzero> ghost enemies in sekiro are just bad
[3:40:06] <ShichiNoBushi> Spank the baby so it would cry and you know its lungs work.
[3:40:07] <$AbsoluteUppercut> How many hours do you have in DMC5 now?
[3:40:11] <+SolverCODO> you don't NEED to fight the ghosts either, so it's not as necessary as confetti
[3:40:12] <%Toynota10> You see the video of someone beating DMD Vergil in 18 seconds with only Dr. Faust?
[3:40:16] <aimlesshealer> They ran away screaming
[3:40:17] <Nina96> have u?
[3:40:18] <%mostundesired> blink.gif
[3:40:22] <+sourceofall> i farmed 7000 gold trying to get enough confetti to learn the o-rin fight
[3:40:23] <%brickwall35> fight the goblins Pat
[3:40:25] <%cherubs_anonymous> He's seeing ELMO
[3:40:26] <%spiritofmojave> sorta?
[3:40:27] <+SolverCODO> @angriestpat do you do therapy to help with the goblins?
[3:40:28] <%waifoong98> @Toynota10 paid to fuck off LUL
[3:40:28] <lizard0tm> I have a feeling that Bloodborne and Sekiro are connected, they both have Red Eye enemies and horrible monstar beast
[3:40:30] <joylent_blue> shut up patty
[3:40:31] <benjiFG> was that Lady's voice?
[3:40:31] <+oOZtkOo> its okay pat i luv u
[3:40:31] <%Agami23> seeing a therapist is just a temporary buff
[3:40:31] <%lewdskeletor13> It doesn’t seem to have worked...
[3:40:31] <%Prevot> the candy keeps the goblins away
[3:40:32] <LegendaryDorkKnight> ne comprende pas
[3:40:32] <%CerberusDriver> kyrie
[3:40:32] <Master_Moridin> Just letting bandit shopkeep sell it or buy it from the idol would have done wonders
[3:40:32] <DSD24> That was Kyrie
[3:40:34] <Straxx__> There's a
[3:40:34] <Jontman42> I don't see why it's bad to just leave the apparitions 'till endgame

[3:40:43] <+dougrayman> did i get here in time for pat to get blown up? (just cleared Nero with super nero. took me 2 tries to finish it)
[3:40:44] <%gus_hornblende> pat you are apatBig and game small
[3:40:45] <%Dr00_PhD> NO VIDEO

[3:40:46] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> oh ok. I was just typing to ask who the title voice was
[3:40:47] <$rdark_ksu> @AngriestPat Does Paige have a strong opinion on BBQ? Would love to argue bbq with her while you laugh at our americanisms
[3:40:51] <Covil91> V eats Bloody Palace for dinner. I assume that will change when more Furies appear.
[3:40:51] <joylent_blue> KYRIE, THE CHARACTER WHO BARELY SAYS ANYTHINg
[3:40:53] <Nina96> no video
[3:40:54] <%waifoong98> did you mod the gameyet? Kappa
[3:40:55] <%lewdskeletor13> Oh hey it’s Kyrie that character that was BARELY in the game at all
[3:40:57] <arcaderabbit48> Yeah. I think that answers my question pretty well.
[3:41:00] <%NopeBadguy> alright what character we playing
[3:41:01] <%spiritofmojave> Kyrie, the character with NO 3D MODEL
[3:41:01] <+SolverCODO> fine for me on mobile
[3:41:03] <%Hilleltaco> Demon bell and possession balloons helped me a lot with getting divine confetti, but that's just even more prerequisites for getting the things
[3:41:03] <benjiFG> nero can't even say ily to kyrie
[3:41:05] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> WAIT. IS PATTY A TITLE VOiCE
[3:41:05] <%mostundesired> Did dit.
[3:41:07] <extradopeness> Chilll guys
[3:41:08] <Zombrocom> V versus Furies NotLikeThis

[3:41:10] <%CerberusDriver> @Covil91 try a room full of Furies, that are DT'd
[3:41:10] <+SolverCODO> oh the game ope
[3:41:11] <aimlesshealer> Kyrie is too glorious for our filthy eyes
[3:41:11] <sileo_patronus> They honestly should've just made divine confetti into an expensive as fuck prosthetic
[3:41:13] <joylent_blue> Sphincter_Spelunker yeah LUL
[3:41:15] <%dukenux> That WALLPAPER
[3:41:15] <%Toynota10> Danger. Bloodstain. Hellfire. Shadow
[3:41:18] <jubejube56> wait is there actually a kyrie 3d model?
[3:41:20] <+G_Thunders> Headless are definitely endgame mini bosses anyway. The stuff they drop makes the main consumables pointless
[3:41:21] <DSD24> Kyrie should have been in the game more
[3:41:21] <lloyddboy> KYRIE FOR LADIES NIGHT
[3:41:22] <%Agami23> watching pats stream is a temporary buff. makes me happy for a while before things set back in.
[3:41:22] <lizard0tm> Fury's are hard for V
[3:41:25] <%Prevot> NotLikeThis
[3:41:25] <mangocoal01> No co-op or Vergil? Dang.
[3:41:26] <lloyddboy> CAPCOM DO IT
[3:41:26] <Saltmeisterr> when's the everyone vergil run
[3:41:27] <SidBoyTM> Hey @AngriestPat Is there anywhere other than steam where one could get the OST for Shovel Knight?
[3:41:28] <%NopeBadguy> WTF IS WARM UP
[3:41:30] <Megapikman132> heck yeah
[3:41:32] <%mostundesired> You must spank it.
[3:41:36] <lizard0tm> Anyone got any tips for fighting them as V?
[3:41:38] <Nina96> @AngriestPat what if Kyrie became playable?
[3:41:39] <b_ikki> warm up lets you play floors you've made it to
[3:41:40] <aimlesshealer> BUTTLlCK
[3:41:42] <%lewdskeletor13> SPANK THAT CAT apatElmo
[3:41:42] <AlasterAngelo> @NopeBadguy practice against floors you've cleared

[3:41:55] <SirBrawler18> Good evening Pat bp is fun, buck floor 70. Farthest I got and its w/ V
[3:41:55] <Covil91> So it's Pat's fault for Crazy Talking co-op Bloody Palace, right? hmeBlank
[3:41:55] <Ultimatefool> ...Just use it when you need them... ???
[3:41:56] <Megapikman132> I get that.
[3:41:56] <Hydrapissed> !uptime
[3:41:57] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 41m.
[3:41:57] <Ner234> No Co-op or Vergil. But Bloody Palace is still hype tho
[3:42:00] <alwayspronking> Kind of. Actually.
[3:42:00] <Mrbaconator> it's not a waste if you win
[3:42:01] <rosemon5001> no it doesnt
[3:42:02] <jubejube56> Kyrie should just play like V but with angelos
[3:42:02] <$afronooch> yeah.
[3:42:02] <DracaenaLeaf> I get it but still
[3:42:03] <$MightyMaxT> I feel ya there
[3:42:04] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> >I don't know what I'm doing, and at this point I'm too afraid to ask
[3:42:05] <+kyuubisonic> i get that
[3:42:06] <Neo_Kaiser> There's a clip for Scrub qoutes.

[3:42:08] <+Mockisho> Me see a Elmo.
[3:42:08] <vVAstrAVv> man youre fucked up
[3:42:09] <+moosemonkey397> Use them like youre playing bloodborne. Go hard always
[3:42:09] <%MagickBurritoh> Just use them as you get them
[3:42:10] <+oOZtkOo> i think i understand, but practice makes perfect
[3:42:12] <joylent_blue> SirBrawler18 floor 70 with V monkaS
[3:42:12] <Megapikman132> But what about scenarios where you have nothing to lose?
[3:42:12] <%waifoong98> How did you play old monhun Pat?
[3:42:13] <lizard0tm> @AngriestPat Do you know how to Estus or Gourd? It's the same Principle
[3:42:14] <%JenovasPuppet> Just go the complete opposite direction and say that using it is never a waste.
[3:42:15] <%spiritofmojave> so you're saying you groomed yourself to do that by the type of games you played?
[3:42:17] <%mostundesired> Using items DansGame
[3:42:18] <marvel877> Pat, don't drink that Diet Coke, you might need it later...
[3:42:19] <%spiritofmojave> I get that
[3:42:19] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Devil Stars
[3:42:19] <SirDogBear> pat is the type of player with 35 elixers at end of ff runs
[3:42:22] <lizard0tm> But sometimes you do
[3:42:23] <Megapikman132> Or literally can't waste them?
[3:42:23] <%El_Desperad0> @Ner234 Capcom never hinted or confirmed it though
[3:42:25] <+Roundelay11> souls
[3:42:26] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Holy Water
[3:42:27] <CSeriesJTYPE> wasting them provides a learning opportunity so you better know when to actually use them effectively
[3:42:27] <Rhinoprotoss> ????
[3:42:27] <+HelveticaScenario> Think about it this way, it's a waste if you DON'T use them.

[3:42:28] <LegendaryDorkKnight> Debiru May Crybaby
[3:42:28] <RoboXGP> Herb
[3:42:29] <Darkrenai> Hey man you should use the monk candy at this final boss. "But i only have 85 of them"
[3:42:32] <deadguyisdead> consumables are meant to be consumed, so just do it and don't give a fuck
[3:42:32] <%nmaten> youre misinterpreting what we mean by need tho
[3:42:32] <derekwst3> then calm down
[3:42:33] <%ElenaManetta> what about minecraft the best game of all time
[3:42:33] <lizard0tm> And if you don't they make it easier
[3:42:33] <%JenovasPuppet> If you never need them, you can never waste them
[3:42:34] <%lewdskeletor13> You did need them tho
[3:42:35] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> So why did you waste the item on the Final Boss of Shovel Knight?
[3:42:36] <%brickwall35> @AngriestPat if you never need to use it, you can't waste it
[3:42:37] <%GoldeNOVA> @AngriestPat So why do you care about using them? They'rre useless.
[3:42:38] <%TheQButton> The problem is not getting max value from an item is still more value then never using that item.
[3:42:38] <+PriorityDrelb> Coming from the classic DooM mentality, HOLY SHIT i agree
[3:42:39] <$rdark_ksu> pat god damnit do you not eat when you are hungry?
[3:42:39] <%MagickBurritoh> use them whenever they would help
[3:42:39] <+Jordan_z123> Herbs ?
[3:42:42] <%Konquerer> pat likes it hard
[3:42:42] <RutilusMonachus> Here's the trick, you never actually need them So it's actually hard to waste something you don't need, unless you waste it by not using it to make your life easier
[3:42:45] <+Roundelay11> estus is REQUIRED
[3:42:45] <+DeRedBaron> honestly its similar with like RPS where you have like 100 X pottions and like when do you need them?
[3:42:47] <SirBrawler18> ELMO
[3:42:48] <ScreamingMeat> Then just use them when you WANT to, or feel like it'll make a fight easier
[3:42:49] <+DeRedBaron> like the best time?
[3:42:49] <Covil91> So what's your excuse for never Devil Triggering? LUL
[3:42:49] <DracaenaLeaf> Benefit from would b the better term
[3:42:50] <+NekoNinja13> PREACH TO THE CHOIR PAT
[3:42:51] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> @AngriestPat Consider using a reserve: Keep 2 or 3 items for when you REALLY need them, then use the rest freely
[3:42:58] <%meltdown547> Time is consumed, the items are the tradeoff. Is your time worth 1 elixer to win an encounter you'd otherwise lose?
[3:43:00] <%deviljhojho94> we bloody palace now lads?
[3:43:00] <Megapikman132> uh huh...
[3:43:00] <+maybefalco> thats how i was with FFXV, i almost never used anything outside of healing items
[3:43:00] <+Grayhammatter> oh god
[3:43:00] <%nmaten> thats the crazy part pat
[3:43:01] <powerprotoman> thats a fuckin lie
[3:43:01] <aimlesshealer> That makes no sense
[3:43:02] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Ok, that's goblin talk
[3:43:02] <Ner234> @Plague_Nurse I know. Wasn't that convinced but It would've been nice. i don't mind really.
[3:43:02] <Ion_Laser> LUL
[3:43:03] <%NopeBadguy> I mean if you think aobut it, never using something is wasteful
[3:43:03] <%JenovasPuppet> God damn it LUL
[3:43:05] <%mostundesired> LUL
[3:43:05] <%graffitisamurai> When victory is in sight but you need more time
[3:43:05] <%brickwall35> hadn't you already beaten Shovel Knight?
[3:43:06] <+Lost_Zombie> This is what item disability looks like huh

[3:43:09] <rideroftraps1> it's Re2 fault isn't it
[3:43:10] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> You completely wasted the item in Shovel Knight, how could you
[3:43:10] <ScreamingMeat> Spank the Mo
[3:43:11] <+PriorityDrelb> never use the BFG, always use the SSG
[3:43:12] <Ion_Laser> Elmo trying to ban people with his butt

[3:43:13] <bleugh> That's Wrong
[3:43:14] <+Mockisho> I wish I wasn't allergic to cats.
[3:43:15] <derekwst3> waste them, who cares if you need them.
[3:43:15] <ShichiNoBushi> Typing with his tail.
[3:43:16] <%lmybestfriendl> final fantasy
[3:43:16] <aimlesshealer> If you don't NEED them, then you have nothing to lose
[3:43:16] <vVAstrAVv> if you waste it who caaares?
[3:43:17] <+SolverCODO> herbs are a required item. you just take them at low health, there's no choice so no stress
[3:43:17] <+G_Thunders> But if you’re gonna be upset that the game doesn’t give you enough... how would it possibly matter if you don’t use them anyway?
[3:43:18] <%GeneralSCPatton> In the same way you never actually need a liver transplant.
[3:43:19] <+Spacebuck> it was a good use of item, just happens that health dont matter in the pit
[3:43:20] <%mostundesired> Ah, so it was RE2
[3:43:23] <Jontman42> Game design doesn't work like that anymore.
[3:43:25] <%lewdskeletor13> I think you learned this no item thing from your obsessive playing of RE2 back in the day? @angriestpat
[3:43:28] <%Reaped_Psyche> As soon as I use a buff Item, for some reason all my skill leaves me and I get punked. Totally wasting the item.
[3:43:28] <CptBritches> That does make sense, you don't actually know for sure what is coming on your first playthrough
[3:43:30] <+oOZtkOo> pat doesnt like the uncertainty of it
[3:43:30] <+DeRedBaron> @AngriestPat It gets even worse when you do it on things with resource and meter cus you can both waste the item AND waste teh resrouce too
[3:43:31] <%nmaten> just think about it less
[3:43:32] <%brickwall35> But you had already beaten Shovel Knight???
[3:43:33] <lizard0tm> But then there's no point, you make the game unfun by doing that?
[3:43:33] <+ahdurian> that makes no sense to me
[3:43:35] <%Hilleltaco> There's also seemingly a weird bug with the purple umbrella prosthetic upgrade, its followup attack apparently dispels your confetti buff
[3:43:39] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Don't bring up Remake 2. That has got to be the worst it's been
[3:43:39] <+Sxy_T_Rex> @AngriestPat there's also the stream anxiety of "what if I get stuck and ruin enjoyment of the audience"
[3:43:42] <SirDogBear> i just wish you could try out certain moves before using skill points like dmc
[3:43:48] <%Kenori> Pat, you just....gotta....use the thing.
[3:43:48] <%BioApple> The trick is to impose an upper limit on the amount of consumables you can carry, so it's a waste if you find an item you can't pick up bc you're already full
[3:43:50] <%nmaten> shovel knight isnt a survival horror
[3:43:51] <squirtkitten> @AngriestPat ARe you ever going to touch the Metro series?
[3:43:52] <%Kenori> Just remember that its all in your head
[3:43:54] <%Kenori> Just...do it
[3:43:55] <powerprotoman> resident evil 2 ruined your brain, got it never play re2
[3:44:00] <derekwst3> well if you used them and wasted them, its your own fault, get GOOD
[3:44:03] <%mostundesired> FUCK THAT
[3:44:07] <%Agami23> but pat, you might have needed those 300 shotgun rounds after the final boss
[3:44:08] <alexandrecau> but that's useless by then to use items if you already did the game once without item
[3:44:12] <%Kenori> God imagine if you did that for Estus?
[3:44:15] <%waifoong98> you meant you didn't use item to 1 shot Daemon in DD Kappa
[3:44:16] <extradopeness> YEYEYEYE RIDIN HIGH
[3:44:16] <vVAstrAVv> then reload
[3:44:16] <%Kenori> Like, imagine never using Estus
[3:44:18] <JamvaanPS4> Oh hai Snap Seeds
[3:44:19] <televisedrevolting> @sirdogbear You can though. In DMC 5.
[3:44:24] <%spiritofmojave> I just didn't get treating Shovel Knight like a JRPG, you actively recover MP throughout it via refreshment items/etc.
[3:44:25] <Megapikman132> ok, but it shovel knight, you get back all of your items charges when you die, so???
[3:44:28] <RutilusMonachus> Pat, if you aren't going to use them anyways, it's more wasteful than any misuse of the item you can have
[3:44:30] <LegendaryDorkKnight> just never use anything ever
[3:44:30] <SidBoyTM> That sucks
[3:44:33] <SidBoyTM> :/
[3:44:33] <%graffitisamurai> Ok but why were you so whiny about mana?
[3:44:34] <AttentionPelican> The only way to learn how to use items is to use them, fuck up, and learn from that
[3:44:36] <%Big_Dream> V is stupid easy baby mode
[3:44:39] <%lewdskeletor13> I see what you’re saying
[3:44:41] <derekwst3> just think of it as wasting money
[3:44:42] <+G_Thunders> You’re only worse off if you never actually finish the game because of that choice
[3:44:42] <RoidedUpRedfield> everyone ask capcom for vergil on twitter
[3:44:42] <sileo_patronus> @Megapikman132 not potions
[3:44:46] <%Kenori> How dd you get through Bloodborne?
[3:44:50] <LegendaryDorkKnight> stockpile for the apocalypse
[3:44:52] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> But if you weren't going to use it anyway. Why not just waste them right away
[3:44:53] <Nina96> your making it harder for no reason
[3:44:54] <Megapikman132> that's fair
[3:44:56] <%Agami23> @AngriestPat imagine using a buncha healing items on killer and his giant eyeball in persona 4 thinking he is the final boss.
[3:44:58] <%TheShal> Every recovery item/bullet in your inventory when the credits roll are WASTED items cause they were NEVER used
[3:45:06] <californaya> but enemies drop them.
[3:45:09] <Nina96> They drop pretty often off enemys
[3:45:10] <%spiritofmojave> fair enough
[3:45:11] <%Kenori> you can almost be assured that you will get some health and some mana back before you fight a boss?
[3:45:12] <+SolverCODO> Guys it's about having a CHOICE to use an item. Healing items must be used at low health, there's very little choice
[3:45:13] <%graffitisamurai> Wth pat
[3:45:15] <+ahdurian> having to memorize when to use an item seems like such an unfun way to play a game to me
[3:45:16] <%Kenori> Pat, this is video games 101
[3:45:16] <%nmaten> you should trust the game devs more to not be actively fucking you
[3:45:19] <fillmydarksoulwithlight> Vout to
[3:45:19] <%BioApple> @TheShal no that's like your final score
[3:45:22] <derekwst3> Always save one, any others just use them
[3:45:26] <marvel877> You lack the intuition for when stuff's going to pop up.
[3:45:26] <fillmydarksoulwithlight> Bout to hear some crazy shit
[3:45:26] <Caidezes> Pat's just crazy. End of story.
[3:45:28] <%GeneralSCPatton> But you can trust that they are reasonably spaced
[3:45:28] <SirDogBear> @televisedrevolt whoops should have clarified, I mean in Sekiro, i wish you could try out some things like Ashina Cross before using points. DMC did it right. Sorry for confusion
[3:45:31] <vVAstrAVv> amulet carried me through shovel knight. pump your magic capacity enough and its never an issue
[3:45:31] <Redbee2000> I just found put today you can play as cleaned up mission 10 Dante by holding both bumpers and triggers in the character select
[3:45:34] <+Grayhammatter> yes, but you can get it back
[3:45:36] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> If you know you will get back what you spend then it is ok to spend an item
[3:45:37] <%Konquerer> no because apatCrazy apatCrazy apatCrazy apatCrazy
[3:45:38] <silverira> the item exist they are meant to be used use to get a leverage if you lose that's on you
[3:45:39] <SidBoyTM> @AngriestPat Are there any games that have the item mechanic where the effects only work when you use them and then die?
[3:45:39] <Megapikman132> @AngriestPat I get not using the potions, but the items recharge after every death. It's more wasteful to die with full mana!
[3:45:45] <%Noahccountingfortaste> @AngriestPat I find it helps to use my OTHER OCD so I use the big consumables to keep them in stacks of 5
[3:45:45] <Rhinoprotoss> Sounds like you're just bad at item management
[3:45:47] <powerprotoman> nope
[3:45:48] <RutilusMonachus> I understand that you don't want to waste items, but Devs these days are not going to make encounters you need a rare consumable to complete
[3:45:49] <aimlesshealer> I can't make an argument about this without gesticulating LUL
[3:45:51] <Covil91> Fucking Soulsbourne buff items...
[3:45:54] <Mr_Strut> It doesn't work Pat. That's the point.
[3:45:54] <%spiritofmojave> futile use of items can suck yeah
[3:45:55] <+G_Thunders> No because I’m gonna use another item the next time I try
[3:45:55] <+metalsiren31> Divine Confetti pvpWhy
[3:45:56] <%rytyoung> Did Pat get all the endings in Sekiro?
[3:45:57] <%ElenaManetta> Stardew Valley "I lost an item when I reached 0 HP" makes me quit
[3:45:58] <+HelveticaScenario> Ask yourself, though, are you EVER going to use it?
[3:46:00] <Jontman42> @AngriestPat Like with Snap Seed I didn't even consider using them since I'm not going to waste a bunch of time not learning to deal with the mechanic without them, since I'll run out anyway.
[3:46:01] <%Kenori> I still dont know how you managed to get through Bloodborne
[3:46:04] <%BioApple> Momodora is wonderful because it treats every item like estus so there's no penalty for using them
[3:46:05] <derekwst3> @AngriestPat Save one for emergency, use any extras
[3:46:06] <LegendaryDorkKnight> agreed
[3:46:09] <silverira> in sekiro would you not ressurect just in fear of losing it?
[3:46:10] <%mostundesired> It's like, you didn't just lose, you lost with poor item management. So you double suck.
[3:46:10] <deadguyisdead> you're insane
[3:46:10] <televisedrevolting> @sirdogbear No problems.
[3:46:11] <RealPT1> it feels twice as bad to loose something than it does to gain something of equal value
[3:46:12] <%deviljhojho94> real kick in the balls
[3:46:13] <mr_slaide> How about slowly drowning?
[3:46:15] <%graffitisamurai> Pat these are potions not masterballs
[3:46:15] <aimlesshealer> He got the teabag ending
[3:46:18] <lizard0tm> Divine Confetti is THE ONLY example I cane think of for that logic
[3:46:21] <troxcree> Nothing hurts more than killing a boss one hit after using a full heal item.
[3:46:25] <Turbocommand> Sacrificing options for something that can be overcomed normally?
[3:46:26] <MementoExtasis> @AngriestPat seems theres also a lil bit of anxiety mixed in
[3:46:28] <%deviljhojho94> shura is boring tbh unless you want that cheevo
[3:46:29] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> @AngriestPat I feel like I should point out you never would have used it anyway, so it might as well have not existed
[3:46:30] <RoboXGP> I haven't gotten out of the lake in DW11
[3:46:35] <%Kenori> All of the healing is consumables
[3:46:36] <+SolverCODO> @angriestpat they don't understand that it's the CHOICE to use an item. Having to make a choice and then losing something because of that choice. Healing items simply must be used at low health. no choice, no stress.
[3:46:37] <Nina96> Blood vials?
[3:46:37] <RoboXGP> nvm
[3:46:38] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> @AngriestPat Consider using a reserve: Keep 2 or 3 items for when you REALLY need them, then use the rest freely
[3:46:39] <dosan121> god forbid if you played ninja gaiden black, you can get stuck big time if you don't have elixirs for bosses, like, uncompletable if you don't have the skills(and rng)
[3:46:40] <%nmaten> Its hard to understand the difference between not using items and having them stockpiled and not using items while having none
[3:46:45] <%Kenori> like, yeah at some point you can buy them, but you have to farm for HOURS
[3:46:46] <arcaderabbit48> @AngriestPat That acutally puts it in perspective a bit better. As someone who prioritizes keeping my options open, I can somewhat udnerstand the idea that using an option takes it away.
[3:46:48] <%mostundesired> It takes 5 minutes to get more blood vials. And you can buy them.
[3:46:49] <RutilusMonachus> He farmed the everloving shit out of Blood Vials so that it's impossible for him to run out, that's how he beat Bloodborne
[3:46:49] <+G_Thunders> He didn’t use the gun in bloodborne
[3:46:50] <%brickwall35> @AngriestPat I think another aspect of your goblins is an (un?)conscious pride in not using items as well.
[3:46:51] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Blood vials were just farmed. It sucked. But you did it
[3:46:52] <$MightyMaxT> @AngriestPat I know people give you crap over your OCD issues and say "Just don't though lul" but hey, it's cool dude. Don't worry about them
[3:46:53] <%rytyoung> Im stuck on genichiro and creepyisshin
[3:46:54] <$afronooch> how do you play looter shooters pat? does that not trigger the same thing?
[3:46:55] <Jontman42> You also get a weapon skill from the Shura ending I think
[3:46:58] <+CharredChord> about to start? glad I didn't miss it
[3:46:58] <Nina96> omfg pat
[3:47:02] <LegendaryDorkKnight> stockpile Thomas everything
[3:47:02] <%Noahccountingfortaste> @AngriestPat I find it helps to use my OTHER OCD so I use the big consumables to keep them in stacks of 5
[3:47:02] <joylent_blue> unless you suck, blood vials aren't that bad
[3:47:04] <%TheQButton> How did you know to use the Madman's knowledge though?
[3:47:07] <$TheCrispyBoi> @AngriestPat never using them is just as big of a waste
[3:47:10] <%mastertwin2> Like MonHun
[3:47:10] <%Kenori> See, the thing is, I'm like you, but for farming
[3:47:10] <%Agami23> ok no, that part makes sense.
[3:47:14] <%Rngiddion> my shitty playing says otherwise!
[3:47:15] <%Kenori> I DESPISE farming
[3:47:16] <SirDogBear> I remember having to farm blood vials a lot from werewolves
[3:47:20] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> @AngriestPat hey Pat did you see the trailer for the new Divinity game? Tried sending it to you over twitter, but I wasn't sure if you saw it
[3:47:20] <%Kenori> just give me the thing
[3:47:23] <%ElenaManetta> Why not just make it regen HP default at that point
[3:47:23] <42nfl19> DMC has trained me to never use consumables because using consumables means you suck.
[3:47:23] <%Kenori> let me do
[3:47:24] <derekwst3> just save one, use the rest
[3:47:25] <MonocleCoyote> @AngriestPat will you ever stream other classic rpgs after bloodlines?
[3:47:26] <%Prevot> god I hated bloodborne healing
[3:47:26] <%JenovasPuppet> Also they're infinitely replenishable, unlike RE herbs.
[3:47:27] <%Reaped_Psyche> I feel so seen by this conversation right now @AngriestPat
[3:47:27] <$rdark_ksu> honest call to the void. Is Sekiro a souls game? Like is it just a different take?
[3:47:27] <+Sxy_T_Rex> Having to farm divine confetti is a huge bummer
[3:47:27] <lizard0tm> Blood Vials and bullets are consumable and run out, so You need to spen 5 hours farming them
[3:47:28] <%graffitisamurai> Ok soooo mana was scarce in shovel knight?
[3:47:28] <SpaceGuntank> unless you're really bad and end up burning through a shitton early on
[3:47:31] <%Agami23> who cares about mega elixers if i just have 1000. i can spend them all day
[3:47:32] <Ranger747> I ran out some but I suck
[3:47:32] <deathsmions1> any tips for remembering combos in dmc 5?
[3:47:36] <televisedrevolting> My problem with that thought process is that you never end up using them. Like, I get it, having the option is nice, but my issue lies in when you never use them. That being said do whatever, I get it.
[3:47:38] <AHandito> sometimes you just have to accept brain problems to tolerate people and be happy.
[3:47:40] <Nina96> farming is bad and is boring
[3:47:45] <SirDogBear> what i like about sekiro is they brought back real bonfires and estus
[3:47:48] <yaboiiunclephil> Damn Pat sucking TF out that bottle
[3:47:50] <$Kefbar> and why dont you just use them becuase you can beat them without it
[3:47:50] <%lewdskeletor13> I see what you’re saying Pat but I feel like your hangups about items can be a hindrance sometimes
[3:47:56] <$Kefbar> ?
[3:47:58] <%pabstblueriven> That's a feeling I totally get
[3:47:58] <+kyuubisonic> That i i totally get. Farming is the best feeling.
[3:48:02] <derekwst3> borderlands is the only game i like to farm, and its with friends
[3:48:02] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @Nina96 Warframe is nothing but farming. Look at who you're talking to
[3:48:03] <b1gboss007> you're crazy
[3:48:08] <+Anonylesssss> @AngriestPat Will you be playing the dlc for shovel knight they are better then the base game imo
[3:48:08] <Megapikman132> uh huh...
[3:48:09] <%BeastlyP1ays> BeastlyP1ays subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! 
[3:48:11] <%mostundesired> But you can't make every resource functionally limitless, or else you use them in every fight, so what's the point? Balancing items is hard.
[3:48:24] <%brickwall35> well at least you realize that
[3:48:27] <ShichiNoBushi> I figure one thing you might like about Final Fantasy X-2 is that the Alchemist job has access to abilities that are essentially free items like Mega Potions.
[3:48:27] <troxcree> You'll probably really like Spectre knight, he generates mp by hitting enemies.
[3:48:32] <%pabstblueriven> JRPG grinding reduces stress of hard fights but I also just find it relaxing
[3:48:32] <Megapikman132> But you saved like every bullet in that RE2 playthrough, even though you knew what was coming...
[3:48:34] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> YOU HAD HUNDREDS OF ROUNDs
[3:48:40] <+SolverCODO> Pat is aware of the goblins stealing his souls
[3:48:40] <Nina96> @Sphincter_Spelunker iam talking about rpgs like pokemon or dragon quest
[3:48:42] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> HUNDREDS
[3:48:47] <%ElenaManetta> "SHOOT, NO MATTER WHAT UNIFORM" *never shoots*
[3:48:48] <natebud> But think about how you lost all that ammo at the end
[3:48:50] <+Sxy_T_Rex> Yeah Spectre Knight is cool as hell
[3:48:51] <aimlesshealer> Of course he realizes it LUL goblins don't make sense, that's why they're goblins
[3:48:52] <%BioApple> @mostundesired that's why the carry limit works. BB gives you functionally infinite heals, but only a limited amount is accesible at any given time
[3:48:53] <RutilusMonachus> Pat, you should take Baby steps towards not being a complete wackjob
[3:48:53] <%Aeoneth> Boivin you have issues
[3:48:54] <ofloofy> Your fear made it harder LUL
[3:48:55] <poooflingerz> Did I miss bloody palace run?
[3:48:56] <dickbuttwoman> @AngriestPat Did you ever play as a ninja in Nioh? A lot of the ninja abilities is just to have better, refillable versions of consumable items.
[3:48:57] <RoboXGP> That's the smart thing to do
[3:48:57] <%Rngiddion> the true irony is that Mr X doesnt really take damage from anything other than the rocket and its just a timer
[3:48:58] <arcaderabbit48> @AngriestPat I feel like items in general are super hard to balance. If you don't need them, you won't use them. But if you do need them then the player is inclined to hoarde them, because if this is hard then the next boss must be EVEN HARDER
[3:48:58] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@zaworldo)
[3:48:59] <lizard0tm> No
[3:49:00] <MementoExtasis> anxiety
[3:49:01] <%spiritofmojave> It genuinely giving you anxiety that had chest pains is worrying for just, you know, how you go about playing a RPG casually
[3:49:05] <+atlasbot1> START THE GAME
[3:49:05] <+ahdurian> no
[3:49:06] <marvel877> Dont drink the coke, you might need it later.
[3:49:07] <+unknowingchuck> Yes
[3:49:07] <%GeneralSCPatton> But you didn't notice the lattern of how abundant mana was. Maybe halfway through you could have relented because the stuff was obviously everywhere.
[3:49:08] <+JohnMarkley> yes!

[3:49:08] <+kyuubisonic> YES

[3:49:25] <coreybom> nope
[3:49:25] <%galaxyswirl> i just find most items useless
[3:49:25] <T_Sasquatch> because im not crazy
[3:49:25] <%Idziman> sometimes
[3:49:25] <derekwst3> kinda, i save one i
[3:49:25] <DartonLance> depends if i know i can get more
[3:49:25] <immortan_joel> Sometimes
[3:49:26] <Saltmeisterr> nope
[3:49:26] <Ultimatefool> No, but not out of a constant need to make sure the NUMBER IS BIG
[3:49:26] <extradopeness> Yes
[3:49:26] <MementoExtasis> @AngriestPat i think everybody hoards them A LIL BIT
[3:49:26] <ofloofy> Chug all teh items
[3:49:26] <+cowcow6> yes but recently in p5 ive just completely given up on saving items
[3:49:27] <wummzy> no
[3:49:27] <%Capnrainbow> Yes
[3:49:27] <SidBoyTM> =Depends
[3:49:27] <simpleskeleton> Yes
[3:49:28] <beetbo2> yeh
[3:49:28] <%GoldeNOVA> @AngriestPat I used to have problems, but once I started taking anxiety medication it went away
[3:49:28] <+SirBearic> yes. rarer the item the harder it is for me to commit to using it
[3:49:28] <+Gespens> I don't have etoo much problems, I just chug
[3:49:28] <RoboXGP> Earthbound, Golden sun
[3:49:28] <%DarkSideCow> rare items yes others no
[3:49:29] <OkamiDude15> what are we talking about?
[3:49:29] <LegendaryDorkKnight> DONT USE ANYTHING EVER
[3:49:29] <b1gboss007> i used to but forced myself to use them and i no longer do
[3:49:29] <%TheBattleGoose> Only for apatBig items
[3:49:30] <%connos_livereview> i used to have mind goblins but i got them fixed...mostly
[3:49:30] <+Sxy_T_Rex> woolieTRASH woolieTRASH woolieTRASH
[3:49:31] <%barkon345> sometimes
[3:49:31] <%thackattack00> no
[3:49:31] <DescendantDroog> GOD YES
[3:49:32] <MeltingFaceMan> Yes. Exactly the same problem you describe.
[3:49:32] <DonatelloJose> Yes, but it doesn’t stress me out
[3:49:32] <%lazylynch> yeah
[3:49:32] <+RobotPancake> I cant use skill points
[3:49:33] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> I'm infected by mind goblins
[3:49:33] <Rexenexus> no just fuckin use em
[3:49:33] <mangocoal01> Nah, I use items
[3:49:34] <zepelinnn> i use them to clutch fights im not supposed to beat
[3:49:34] <%waifoong98> I grind POWER too much to need ITEMS apatDab
[3:49:34] <%rytyoung> P5 is the worst
[3:49:34] <%Kenori> The FULL HEALS are the problem
[3:49:35] <%GeneralSCPatton> Depends on availability
[3:49:36] <derekwst3> i save one or two
[3:49:36] <Jakeofalco> Well yeah
[3:49:36] <%Dr_DangerPhD> if you grind and over level you don't need to use items anyway
[3:49:36] <imbatman37> no but use to
[3:49:36] <+rawringkhris> you're all sick
[3:49:37] <Prossy> yes i didnt want to ever use my divine confetti
[3:49:37] <%bread_assassin> Nope. I use them more frequently than I should, if anything.
[3:49:38] <%Apathiae> yes
[3:49:38] <Redbee2000> I love having all of them
[3:49:39] <+bearrier_> @AngriestPat sorry i cant hear you from under my MOUNTAINS OF ELIXERS
[3:49:40] <%korth367> No
[3:49:41] <%Fruitywhompus> it feels awful
[3:49:41] <%PalmtopNami> I do it in dnd ffs
[3:49:41] <42nfl19> Using the items means YOU DID NOT PLAY GOOD/OPTIMAL
[3:49:41] <MonocleCoyote> @AngriestPat ive never use them cause i feel like a bitch and a coward :(
[3:49:42] <SidBoyTM> Most JRPGs yes
[3:49:44] <troxcree> You need it later.
[3:49:45] <SirDogBear> what pat needs is a skill that gives you buffs if your horde items... like a junction system from ff8
[3:49:45] <T_Sasquatch> i get it , but at a certain point its ridiuclous
[3:49:46] <%meltdown547> Does the fact that you have beaten everything your entire life without consumables ease your mind that they have no impact on the actual balance of any game, thus making them worthless, and free to use?
[3:49:46] <deathsmions1> but what if you need it for later
[3:49:47] <+NinjaWitaSniper> might need it later
[3:49:48] <Aiden_Sylas_Storm> Difficulty? Nah. Do I usually do so? Nope.
[3:49:50] <silverira> YOU ARE
[3:49:51] <Master_Moridin> never have issues with using healing items, but buff items
[3:49:53] <IceCreamWave_> Yes. Battle Items in pokemon go unused 4ever
[3:49:53] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> i always save at least 3 of any of them
[3:49:54] <aimlesshealer> Older games yeah
[3:49:55] <+Trtickster> I actively avoid using any item I have less than 10 of, in several situations I have bashed my head against a wall on a boss that is supposed to be impossible without using a specific item, and ultimately beat them
[3:49:55] <SirBrawler18> Particularly rare ones. Megaelixers for example
[3:49:55] <%Prevot> what? no
[3:49:56] <%ElenaManetta> I realize there's a high chance I'm probably going to drop the game in a week so I might as well use all my items.
[3:49:57] <+BlackAce186> Yeah cause the idea is to find the ideal way to play without using consumables
[3:49:57] <derekwst3> @AngriestPat i save one or two but spend the rest
[3:49:58] <SidBoyTM> Its the fact that you don't if you're gonna get more
[3:49:59] <%Kirijuo> This is why I like Nioh, all your crazy bullshit gets refilled when you rest
[3:50:00] <%Kenori> Pat, did you use Iosefka's vial or either of the girls vials?
[3:50:01] <SidBoyTM> And that
[3:50:03] <+HelveticaScenario> The thing is YOU are ALWAYS afraid
[3:50:06] <LegendaryDorkKnight> Yup
[3:50:08] <SkyPirateArcane> Totally
[3:50:09] <%Konquerer> rotate your saves
[3:50:09] <%barkon345> yup
[3:50:10] <squirtkitten> Sekiro pisses me off because i know Dragon drop stuff is super limited, so i dont ever want to use because i know im just going t oget everyone infected again
[3:50:10] <koffeemancer> I went through DQXI without using items. That's what magic is for
[3:50:11] <mr_slaide> Yop.
[3:50:11] <Nina96> yes thats a thing
[3:50:12] <+Bloodxb> well batlle items im pokemon are usually trash
[3:50:13] <Rhinoprotoss> But you just said you never need items to finish anything?????
[3:50:13] <DracaenaLeaf> God I hated that
[3:50:16] <laveyrin> You enjoy early point and click games Pat?
[3:50:16] <arcaderabbit48> Oh shit, that's a really good point
[3:50:16] <derekwst3> save one or two and spend rest
[3:50:16] <Ner234> Yeah
[3:50:18] <%brickwall35> just save scum
[3:50:18] <%BioApple> I don't use consumables because keeping track of them is an additional cognitive task and I have the mental energy of a ferret
[3:50:19] <%meraud> Yep
[3:50:20] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> You totally could back when games were good
[3:50:21] <fruit_pie_the_magician> i make shapes with the trails lights leave when I dart my eyes around. Honestly it probably makes me look crazy as fuck
[3:50:21] <emillionghost> yes
[3:50:22] <%spiritofmojave> It's more like your worried you'll have another run at a boss and will 'need that item'
[3:50:22] <%Jaxnos> the RE2 one is actually the worst because you KNOW that the game works with you and your ammo count. Like, you KNEW the system and still didn't use items.
[3:50:23] <DonatelloJose> This is a fair explanation. If you were playing those busted old games
[3:50:23] <+DeRedBaron> @AngriestPat some are legit like when do i need to use this super heal or limited you can't buy MP restore
[3:50:23] <Nina96> those r bad
[3:50:24] <marvel877> Yeah, and that was a result of poor game design.
[3:50:24] <%rytyoung> My problem is fitting them into your turn rotation
[3:50:26] <%mostundesired> Fucking Pokemon did that for me, ironically. Because I was a dumb kid and kept getting lost underwater.
[3:50:28] <+PriorityDrelb> BFG mentality, super get it
[3:50:28] <Ultimatefool> But games like that are 1 in a million nowadays
[3:50:30] <%Brentsei> it has made me do it in like any game possible with expendable items
[3:50:30] <sileo_patronus> Those vials were garbage
[3:50:32] <arcaderabbit48> Those were just inconvenient
[3:50:36] <fillmydarksoulwithlight> @angriestpat i cant not play the main charecter in rpgs even though its super encouraged nowadays because older games would strip you of a party all the time
[3:50:36] <%Agami23> it should have just been holding down triangle to use it
[3:50:36] <%Kenori> yeah same, I never used any of them
[3:50:41] <laveyrin> That is the only genre that I can remember that you could lock yourself out of clearing due to item use
[3:50:43] <Caidezes> @AngriestPat I just keep at least one of every consumable item in my inventory at all times and use any extras I get.
[3:50:46] <Jontman42> I just treated the vials as lore items
[3:50:46] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Pat, seriously why didn't you tell us how fucking infuriating Ace Combat 7 is? I've got spit flying out of my mouth
[3:50:47] <+AlwaysHuffer> Kinda ruins the game balance if you farm items that much i guess,i prefer farming the essentials only if i run out completely,i borderline hate using buff items though
[3:50:48] <derekwst3> pokemon i just threw a pokemon at mewtwo first turn and caught it
[3:50:49] <arfsm95> @angriestpat i understand you and and do the same, but when i get to endgame, i fucking use it all, fucking Magnum shot in a dog
[3:50:55] <SirDogBear> those vials were fun because of the crazy girl looking at you if you got other blood
[3:50:59] <%waifoong98> just knife everything Kappa
[3:51:00] <$rdark_ksu> pat I remember having this argument with my friend when i was fucking 11
[3:51:00] <RoboXGP> Conserve Amoo!
[3:51:01] <emillionghost> jesus why
[3:51:02] <silverira> lies
[3:51:04] <derekwst3> pokeball i mean
[3:51:04] <%lewdskeletor13> There’s probably a nice middle ground you should be able to find
[3:51:09] <Jontman42> Games aren't designed like that anymore, though.
[3:51:12] <arcaderabbit48> Games were rather poorly designed back then
[3:51:12] <RetributionP> Okay Pat. You are old. that's the only reason for your goblinz. That dosnt happen any more in games. you are now cured.
[3:51:13] <silverira> you can finish the game with a knife
[3:51:18] <%lewdskeletor13> I scout ahead like that in games all the time
[3:51:19] <LegendaryDorkKnight> first few runs of OG RE2 were throwaway runs
[3:51:23] <%Kenori> Oh yeah that happened to me on my first playthrough of Leon B side, I ran out of everything on Burkin and couldnt beat him. I didnt have enough damage with my knife
[3:51:23] <Rhinoprotoss> That defeats the point
[3:51:24] <aimlesshealer> If you can change the way you think about it, I think you can conquer it. Like you said, it's a feeling
[3:51:25] <SidBoyTM> @AngriestPat How do you feel about games that allow you to make your own comsumables (i.e. Elder Scrolls)
[3:51:26] <%Kenori> So I feel ya there
[3:51:27] <deadguyisdead> @angriestpat but games aren't designed like that anymore, let it go man
[3:51:27] <natebud> I've never run into that problem ever, except for CVX but that game sucks.
[3:51:29] <%spiritofmojave> Do you think that punishing system of item use influenced you to how you are
[3:51:30] <%Kenori> But some games just arent that
[3:51:33] <+NekoNinja13> I only use items when I /absolutely 100% have/ to @AngriestPat , other than that i try to brute force it or cleverly plan through it
[3:51:33] <ShichiNoBushi> It's possible to catch anything with a Pokéball. It's just abysmally unlikely.
[3:51:34] <%RageKingDomo> ya you saw how the piss babies reacted to Sekiro they dont do that for alot of games anymore
[3:51:36] <+DeniedPants> Playing games like the old Final Fantasys made me despise playing as mages due to needing to use mana potions
[3:51:38] <derekwst3> throw the pokeball first turn on mewtwo and you catch it, the birds knock them away
[3:51:40] <%graffitisamurai> @angriestpat bosses in jrpgs are free game use it all
[3:51:43] <%Jaxnos> that doesn't explain you saving ammo after you know the system and what to expect though
[3:51:44] <max_radical> is the strim wrapping up or is this a break
[3:51:46] <%nmaten> mon hun
[3:51:46] <%mostundesired> LUL
[3:51:48] <dickbuttwoman> @AngriestPat Did you ever play Nioh as a ninja? A lot of the ninja abilities are to just have better, bonfire-refillable versions of consumable items.
[3:51:49] <%waifoong98> Monhun is tedious confirmed LUL
[3:51:50] <Nina96> @AngriestPat u play monhun
[3:51:50] <joylent_blue> chat you are actively delaying BP time by this items convo 😡
[3:51:50] <%deviljhojho94> morrowind alchemy is fucked
[3:51:50] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> But saves are thing. If it's impossible, reload and rotate your saves NotLikeThis
[3:51:52] <%ElenaManetta> Like Evil Within 2 crafting?
[3:51:53] <%Prevot> LUL
[3:52:01] <+AlwaysHuffer> You rob yourself of the tension for the sake of ocd though arent you?
[3:52:03] <deathsmions1> the moment that made me stop caring was when my sis used a masterball on a random pokemon
[3:52:04] <%Kirby_Sauce> Potency over number
[3:52:11] <%lewdskeletor13> Material Crafting in Prey was fun
[3:52:17] <deathsmions1> that was my goshdang masterbal
[3:52:17] <derekwst3> @AngriestPat cant you save a few for emergencies but use the rest
[3:52:18] <%GeneralSCPatton> You just stockpile and do it in bulk
[3:52:18] <%spiritofmojave> Oblivion potion making was the WORST
[3:52:22] <+dougrayman> i would max out on items and then save all the resources because what if i need them on desperate time? @AngriestPat
[3:52:23] <Covil91> Witcher 3 had great consumables. They refreshed when you slept.
[3:52:24] <WeebFever> Ranged weapons in MonHun = >:c
[3:52:26] <arfsm95> @angriestpat one thing i did to kinda shake off the feeling is like "get an rpg, immediatly shoot it at the first enemy"
[3:52:26] <lizard0tm> @AngriestPat Are you going to play REmake 2 with the classic camera mod?
[3:52:27] <%Kirby_Sauce> Elderscrolls trades off number for potency
[3:52:30] <%mastertwin2> The real payoff in Alchemy in Elder Scrolls is making overpowered poisons and buffs
[3:52:32] <Nina96> @AngriestPat i like monhun crafting
[3:52:34] <LegendaryDorkKnight> Crafting sucks ew >(
[3:52:36] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> Alchemy just feels pointless in Oblivion and Skyrim, but it's busted in Morrowind
[3:52:37] <%Agami23> @AngriestPat remember when pickaxes could break?
[3:52:37] <xstormyone> its miserable until you can buy mega potions
[3:52:38] <%nmaten> the farm trivializes consumables
[3:52:39] <sileo_patronus> Even with the farm it's not fun
[3:52:42] <arcaderabbit48> Skyrim is really bad for that because the items are so far out of the way that I straight up forget that I have that Potion of Frost Resisteance 50%
[3:52:43] <+PriorityDrelb> yeah games like Far Cry 3+ never felt challenging on hard or higher fo that reason
[3:52:44] <+unknowingchuck> Being a bow user is pain in mon hun
[3:52:46] <Ranger747> @lewdskeletor13 Dude yes
[3:52:48] <%Prevot> man can you believe there's weirdos who prefer the old MH farms?
[3:52:50] <Artista_AF> Crafting is ok for non-consumables; but cooking potions was fun in Zelda
[3:52:52] <%rytyoung> Horizon and Last of us works well
[3:52:54] <joylent_blue> Alchemy in Skyrim is only good for MONEY
[3:52:54] <MonocleCoyote> @AngriestPat i only use consummables when i know im fighting the last boss and im sure im gonna beat it
[3:52:55] <%Toynota10> Speaking of RE2, is the SphereHunter person you keep retweeting a friend of yours? She seems pretty cool
[3:52:56] <derekwst3> they need to remake Resident evil Zero with the new engine....
[3:52:57] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @deathsmions1 I stopped caring about Masterballs when they had an ugly summon animation
[3:52:58] <aimlesshealer> I hate crafting in RPGs 90% of the time. It's just clunky and in the way
[3:52:58] <%mostundesired> Crafting is good only if I can do it without thinking too hard, but mastery of it takes genuine investment.
[3:52:59] <SirDogBear> To be fair, in Monster Hunter you supposed to be good enough to not use items, in this game you gotta use the confetti
[3:52:59] <%Prevot> the ones you had to run around doing a bunch of shit
[3:53:05] <CSeriesJTYPE> potion tree is broken
[3:53:05] <%Kenori> I remember the Nioh Beta when WEAPONS WERe DEGRADABLE
[3:53:06] <%nmaten> i never used the blade oils
[3:53:07] <SidBoyTM> @arcaderabbit48 Fair point brother, fair point
[3:53:08] <%Kenori> I nearly lost my shit
[3:53:16] <%Agami23> I wish more games used the dungeon siege method for potions where you drank as much from a potion as you needed so you could save the rest for later
[3:53:17] <vVAstrAVv> only downside to witcher potions was going to the menu so much
[3:53:19] <natebud> I always feel like I've wasted ammo if I finish an RE game with magnum bullets. have you ever thought of it that way? @AngriestPat
[3:53:23] <kingdudeby> I wonder if pats going to do more LPs with his significant other. Woolie.
[3:53:26] <joylent_blue> Giant's Toe + Blue Butterfly wing + Blue mountain flower = PROFIT
[3:53:26] <kevamadi> @AngriestPat I think you're like me Pat. I don't play games like RPGs because I want to BEAT them. I play them to make my characters as powerful as possible, and that includes hoarding items I don't necessarily need in practice, but in theory make me more powerful.
[3:53:29] <zepelinnn> except for games that focus around crafting like atelier, the mechanic should dei
[3:53:29] <%KevinsLunchbox> i left to get food after shovel knight, came back in time for bloody palace
[3:53:31] <%dukenux> In Witcher 2 some early fights seem unwinable without using oils and potions
[3:53:31] <vVAstrAVv> sign build for me baby
[3:53:32] <derekwst3> yes
[3:53:32] <+oOZtkOo> begone goblins!
[3:53:33] <metalliec> who do you think is cuter. Nero or Dante
[3:53:36] <+NinjaWitaSniper> @angriestpat there was a build for Witcher where if you got max toxic you one shot bosses
[3:53:37] <derekwst3> we all do
[3:53:44] <LegendaryDorkKnight> V
[3:53:46] <SidBoyTM> @AngriestPat Quick question, Limited Skill Trees or Crazy ass rollercoaster Skill trees
[3:53:46] <arcaderabbit48> @SidBoyTM I consistently build up a huge, alphabatized list of potions in Skyrim, and ignore 98% of it so I can just beeline for the healing, magic, and stamina potions
[3:53:47] <%Kenori> Get outta here Gobolins
[3:53:47] <%lewdskeletor13> GOBLINS BEGONE
[3:53:48] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Dante is hot. Nero is cute
[3:53:49] <%waifoong98> use everything?
[3:53:49] <+Sxy_T_Rex> @vVAstrAVv griffin school 4 life
[3:53:50] <%spiritofmojave> Witcher 1 crafting system gave me nightmares
[3:53:50] <aimlesshealer> Vergil best boy
[3:53:54] <CSeriesJTYPE> potion tree lets you have infinite blade oil, bombs that explode into four other bombs, potions that give you the effect of another random potion, toxicity damage buffs, etc
[3:53:56] <Redbee2000> Do you know about the Bloody Palace rewards Pat?
[3:53:59] <+SolverCODO> If she uses items, she's a GOBLIIIIIIIN!
[3:54:01] <extradopeness> Nero!
[3:54:06] <metalliec> i think Griffon is cuter
[3:54:08] <arfsm95> @angriestpat you still have the RE2 feeling of "ir i spend my resources then i can actually destroy my save"
[3:54:11] <LegendaryDorkKnight> SAME
[3:54:12] <Nina96> your gonna kill pat at this rate
[3:54:20] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> TRUE
[3:54:22] <joylent_blue> metalliec cuter or more attractive 🤔 nero is cuter but dante is more attractive

[3:54:47] <arkaznor> What broke the habit for me is I once did a challenge where I used ANY buff item as soon as I got it, cause I got tired of finishing games with 99 of them, never used.
[3:54:48] <Ultimatefool> Shitzillion amount of orbs
[3:54:49] <Nina96> @maglewood he dosnt care
[3:54:49] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> all i've gotten from Blood Palace so far is orbs
[3:54:49] <%Agami23> also BIG orbs
[3:54:50] <LegendaryDorkKnight> it better be the dance
[3:54:53] <freedomboyz> is there coop??
[3:54:54] <derekwst3> one for each character, i don't care for neroes
[3:54:55] <SidBoyTM> @arcaderabbit48 I don't really care much for the potion creation in Skyrim either, i just thought it was a cool enough feature to have
[3:54:57] <televisedrevolting> THEY'RE ALL THE SHIT
[3:54:59] <%mostundesired> Do it you coward.
[3:55:01] <joylent_blue> its not that hard honestly
[3:55:01] <%Agami23> guys, pat doesent use faust
[3:55:02] <Halospaz117> NO DO IT THO
[3:55:02] <+Bloodxb> do it

[3:55:05] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@NopeBadguy)
[3:55:05] <%spiritofmojave> DO IT THO
[3:55:05] <mr_slaide> WE LOVE YOU, ELMO!

[3:55:10] <%KevinsLunchbox> apatBig apatHoldon
[3:55:11] <ofloofy> Finish it you cowarrd
[3:55:12] <%waifoong98> I would rather have another recolors urgh
[3:55:13] <%lewdskeletor13> NOT WITH THAT ATTITUDE
[3:55:15] <joylent_blue> only the last like 5 floors are hard
[3:55:20] <%ElenaManetta> I'M AFRAID OF DESTROYING MY GAME (constantly restarts and destroys progress)
[3:55:21] <Rhinoprotoss> But you just said you can beat any game without using items???!!!??
[3:55:21] <Clyderso> Pat the game is destroyed BibleThump
[3:55:25] <derekwst3> that just mean you can replay the game again. its not that hard
[3:55:25] <natebud> You just need a game with more quicksaves.
[3:55:26] <SkyPirateArcane> Old games did that to people. I'm the same Pat
[3:55:27] <SirDogBear> @AngriestPat how did you feel about the junction system in FF8, it rewards hording and not using spells
[3:55:27] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> Don't lie, you'll beat it first try
[3:55:28] <arcaderabbit48> @SidBoyTM Oh yeah, I'm glad its there, and I've done plenty of characters that have at least tried to be Alchemists, but boy does it never work the way I want it to
[3:55:28] <acp101123> he already did bloody palace?
[3:55:30] <%Prevot> das ridicc
[3:55:32] <Redbee2000> Pat if you have to super mode it is super worth it for the taunts
[3:55:33] <sosuke5> Pat, no
[3:55:33] <+Grayhammatter> why would that happen?
[3:55:33] <lloyddboy> DEEP heart
[3:55:35] <joylent_blue> acp101123 no
[3:55:35] <%connos_livereview> yeah well you should stop its 2019 old man
[3:55:36] <Nina96> @AngriestPat what about skills in rpgs?
[3:55:36] <vVAstrAVv> cant you just assume we know better than you in that case lol
[3:55:36] <%unclekulikov> history is merciless
[3:55:37] <TheRadiantDevil> My first run i got 90
[3:55:38] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> That sounds like a personal problem
[3:55:40] <aimlesshealer> Seek refuge in savescumming Kappa
[3:55:42] <%BioApple> I'm this way with meters too. If I can't spec into having a fuckhuge meter recharge speed, that shit might as well always be empty
[3:55:43] <derekwst3> just replay the game
[3:55:45] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Xcom and Darkest Dungeon?
[3:55:48] <arcaderabbit48> @AngriestPat Learned behaviors are a bitch
[3:55:49] <acp101123> I see @joylent_blue , thanks
[3:55:51] <LegendaryDorkKnight> SNES RPGs did that alot
[3:55:51] <%GeneralSCPatton> That is literally insane. Death is a free refill!
[3:55:52] <silverira> not every game is demon souls
[3:55:54] <+DeniedPants> My general rule is to not use items until a boss is at half health or is in final phase
[3:55:55] <metalliec> @AngriestPat but who do you think is cuter tho, Dante or Nero?
[3:55:56] <lloyddboy> tfw no GF
[3:55:59] <kidkalamity01> @kidkalamity01 is new here. Say hello! VoHiYo
[3:56:00] <+Sxy_T_Rex> @AngriestPat so xcom ironman mode is just a no go for ya then?
[3:56:03] <SidBoyTM> @arcaderabbit48 I went through about, 139 characters in skyrim just to get the achievement..
[3:56:04] <%mostundesired> LUL
[3:56:06] <silverira> the worl tendency doesn't change
[3:56:07] <%lewdskeletor13> Aren’t you also irrationally afraid of people spitting in your hair?
[3:56:08] <+DeRedBaron> it's also busy work up the a
[3:56:09] <derekwst3> just start over
[3:56:14] <Gameslayer2> its horrible and i love it
[3:56:14] <%Laecerelius> The Junctioning system was the fucking worst
[3:56:15] <%Mekhet09> The spells didn't even do much.
[3:56:15] <%barkon345> that system was broken as fuck
[3:56:16] <SirDogBear> lol fair enough felt same way myself
[3:56:20] <troxcree> Just make 99 auras and stick them all over yourself.
[3:56:20] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> ironman mode is a no go just in case of bugs. honest man if anything
[3:56:21] <%Mekhet09> Only Aura was good.
[3:56:24] <LegendaryDorkKnight> ff8 junctioning could super be exploited
[3:56:26] <%gus_hornblende> @AngriestPat how did you handle FF15's magic system?
[3:56:26] <powerprotoman> the main problem is you justify not using items with hindsight of events that didn't transpire
[3:56:26] <SidBoyTM> PAT
[3:56:27] <Ner234> LUL
[3:56:28] <aimlesshealer> And the Lasic surgeon
[3:56:30] <MonocleCoyote> @AngriestPat have you played a game where you feel good using consumables?
[3:56:30] <%mostundesired> Yeah, idiots LUL
[3:56:30] <SidBoyTM> That's crazy..
[3:56:31] <+oOZtkOo> of course Kappa
[3:56:31] <%dukenux> LUL
[3:56:32] <%Laecerelius> I only used the Aura spell once I had plenty and annihilated all the bosses
[3:56:32] <+Gooniekorn> just have paige cut your hair
[3:56:33] <%connos_livereview> and the syringe thing
[3:56:33] <%Reaped_Psyche> Meltdown was great too.
[3:56:33] <AHandito> What about an RPG where all items are dumped after completion of a boss?
[3:56:34] <Nina96> @AngriestPat what if chat or paige does it?
[3:56:34] <%spiritofmojave> one reason I'm glad Square and Nintendo are forgetting FF8 LUL
[3:56:35] <PerrinIsDead> Junction is good
[3:56:35] <%nmaten> the goblins are strong
[3:56:37] <%deviljhojho94> what if your dad spits in your hair
[3:56:37] <SidBoyTM> Why though?
[3:56:37] <%JenovasPuppet> Nah nah. "I used a spell, now I'm not noticeably weaker but I need to Draw more of that spell ASAP!"
[3:56:38] <%lewdskeletor13> Obviously LUL
[3:56:38] <+Grayhammatter> pat, no barber is gonna spit in your hair
[3:56:39] <fillmydarksoulwithlight> make 99 heroes from laguna and good to go
[3:56:39] <Dehlome> you cant just wash your hair?
[3:56:41] <%waifoong98> yeah just spam Guardian Force in 8 Kappa
[3:56:43] <OkamiDude15> dont forget about the syringes
[3:56:43] <kingdomkey92> I love the Junction system because of that because magic sucks.
[3:56:44] <%gus_hornblende> .. fair
[3:56:44] <kingdudeby> I don't pay for my haircut unless the barber spits in my hair.
[3:56:46] <arfsm95> @angriestpat and even tough games like dark souls, you can farm yourself to god status and beat it, but in the back of your head is like "no i must save ALL the ammo"
[3:56:46] <%GoldeNOVA> @AngriestPat You don't have a lot of hair, you'd notice if the barber spit on you
[3:56:47] <arcaderabbit48> The fact that its just the barber honestly makes it weirder
[3:56:48] <immortan_joel> What hair?
[3:56:49] <%mostundesired> FFXV had magic? Kappa
[3:56:50] <zepelinnn> EPISODE IGNIS WHEN
[3:56:50] <PerrinIsDead> FF8 is a great game
[3:56:50] <derekwst3> for rpg games i play for a hour to get to know the system and restart it to look like a pro at it
[3:56:52] <%CerberusDriver> FF 15 is meh
[3:56:53] <%unclekulikov> The voice actor for General Shephard from Command and Conquer has died.
[3:56:54] <arcaderabbit48> Same :(
[3:56:55] <troxcree> Why would they make magic so awful?
[3:56:55] <%Reaped_Psyche> FF15 magic is easy mode 'till endgame.
[3:56:56] <+Grayhammatter> i loved using that magic system LUL
[3:56:57] <%Agami23> the magic in ff15 breaks the game.
[3:56:58] <vVAstrAVv> why would a non barber ever spit in pats hair guys lol
[3:57:00] <LegendaryDorkKnight> theres magic in that game?
[3:57:01] <troxcree> It's just grenades
[3:57:03] <+Enryuan> Does it matter if he spits on your hair but washes it later? @AngriestPat
[3:57:03] <%waifoong98> @unclekulikov oh noes
[3:57:04] <%barkon345> using junctioning and the card game my friend was able to get the most powerful spells in the game before he got past the first dungeon
[3:57:04] <Covil91> 15's combat is so trash.
[3:57:05] <%Ranryu692> ff15 was so bad
[3:57:06] <$MightyMaxT> I also never used it until it said I was full
[3:57:07] <PerrinIsDead> FF8 dont deserve the hate
[3:57:07] <themechahobo> I think of it like this, if I get a recovery, but I was at max, then I essentially wasted the resource.Needs a cap to work though.
[3:57:13] <joylent_blue> i think of nero like my son, but i would jump dante's bones in a HEARTBEAT
[3:57:15] <derekwst3> yugioh
[3:57:16] <%dukenux> Wouldn't spit give the bald spot that extra shine?
[3:57:17] <%Faustgesicht> Witcher 3
[3:57:18] <%dukenux> Kappa
[3:57:18] <%Agami23> 9 hits of 9999 damage
[3:57:19] <augmentedman> dark souls has good consumables
[3:57:20] <starotter70> Dead Cells
[3:57:22] <%mostundesired> Good answer.
[3:57:23] <arfsm95> @angriestpat DMC5 and the arms
[3:57:23] <%SlugNut> SlugNut is gifting 1 Tier 1 Subs to AngriestPat's community! They've gifted a total of 1 in the channel! 
[3:57:24] <artoflec> ffxv was awesome and the magic system was really simple to use but you could make some really crazy spell variants
[3:57:24] <%SlugNut> SlugNut gifted a Tier 1 sub to razorknight! 
[3:57:25] <Ultimatefool> Dragon's Dogma had like NECESSARY consumables
[3:57:26] <ScreamingMeat> FF15 is nearly all spectacle and no substance
[3:57:27] <starotter70> apatSmug
[3:57:29] <squirtkitten> Witcher 3 on stream? :D
[3:57:31] <derekwst3> play yugioh
[3:57:33] <Rexenexus> Not even Monster Hunter?
[3:57:35] <+Bloodxb> dragons dogma
[3:57:36] <%mostundesired> @Ultimatefool Eh. A few. But a lot of them were not.
[3:57:37] <%CerberusDriver> @joylent_blue :S
[3:57:40] <%lewdskeletor13> We’re not trying to bully you we just wanna help you beat your goblins Pat <3 @angriestpat
[3:57:41] <%spiritofmojave> @Ultimatefool True, god luck beating Damon without consumables
[3:57:41] <vVAstrAVv> neros arms are a rad consumable cus theyre infinite if youre good and don't break age
[3:57:43] <Dovakhin573> I feel PoE would give you anxiety
[3:57:45] <Nina96> ff15 combat makes me notuios
[3:57:48] <%waifoong98> @Ultimatefool does it? Aside from healing and status cure.
[3:57:52] <SidBoyTM> So, no RE2?
[3:57:55] <aimlesshealer> It seems like it's important that you can reliably restock them
[3:57:57] <joylent_blue> CerberusDriver do not shame my dante thirst pvpSass
[3:58:01] <coreybom> @angriestpat That nes/snes analogy works perfectly, as I'm a ps2/ps3 guy and the thought of lesser items and item punishment confused the fuck, especially in dmc. since they actively give you them, but then punish you for using them. I'm smarter now, but it turned me off from the series for a minute.
[3:58:03] <%no_id_uh> Monster hunter world
[3:58:06] <DonatelloJose> Are there games like Witcher 3 that is actually on par with it?
[3:58:09] <LegendaryDorkKnight> KappaPride
[3:58:09] <%Laecerelius> I HATED PoE's materia system
[3:58:13] <josh813318> Darkest dungeon is a good example of using usable items
[3:58:16] <%GoldeNOVA> @AngriestPat I have a specific thing where I can use consumables WAY easier if they're food items
[3:58:21] <SailingSaturn> ragtime on Fury's cirGasm
[3:58:25] <Dehlome> I never know is POE means Path of Exile or Pillars of Eternity
[3:58:28] <%Dr_DangerPhD> after you beat dmcv once any stress over not using devil breakers goes away honestly
[3:58:28] <SidBoyTM> Define reliably?
[3:58:29] <+Bloodxb> yeah but pat hates playing darkest dungeon
[3:58:30] <Nina96> @AngriestPat did hyper light drifter make goblins appear?
[3:58:32] <$MightyMaxT> Like Blood Vials?
[3:58:32] <Ultimatefool> @waifoong98 Liquid Vim (infinite stamina) was almost necessary to not just wait around regening after fights
[3:58:32] <koffeemancer> @AngriestPat What about Dragon's Dogma?
[3:58:32] <Rexenexus> @AngriestPat mega dash juices on egg quests
[3:58:36] <derekwst3> dante and bugs bunny are the same character
[3:58:36] <Dovakhin573> I meant Path of Exile
[3:58:38] <RealPT1> @AngriestPat I need to see you play Riviera: The Promised Land. It's an RPG all about using disposable items. All attacks are tied to items with durability
[3:58:38] <%waifoong98> @Ultimatefool ah that
[3:58:41] <PerrinIsDead> PoE is GREAT
[3:58:41] <%mostundesired> MY ETHERS THO
[3:58:45] <AHandito> nothing is consumable in POE. everything recharges
[3:58:46] <%DedlokPM> DMC5 I rarely used the Devil Breakers even though I knew they were all over the place just because they are buyable. Also what I need it but I lost it because I got hit while using it.
[3:58:47] <%Reaped_Psyche> FF15 you could buy them. I used them like candy
[3:58:49] <LegendaryDorkKnight> I need em for later tho
[3:58:52] <Spyderninja> pull my ether trigger
[3:58:54] <vVAstrAVv> i remember farming x pots in ff7 good times
[3:58:56] <+kyuubisonic> same
[3:58:56] <SunsetJack> I kinda feel more with using limited skill points where you can't respec.
[3:58:57] <lloyddboy> Isn't there an isekai character that uses nothing but consumable items?
[3:58:58] <TheyCallMeVawn> I literally only use 1 Devil Breaker the whole time
[3:58:59] <+zaworldo> hE STILL isn't playing?!?!
[3:58:59] <%Kenori> In the newer games Etthers are fine, its the Elixers and Megalixers
[3:59:00] <%Prevot> you can buy Ether equivalents in persona, can't you?
[3:59:01] <PerrinIsDead> Check out Path of Exile dude
[3:59:01] <%chaumiester> you have 85 of them
[3:59:05] <+Sxy_T_Rex> @AngriestPat now that ive gotten farther into Sekiro I understand your annoyance with divine confetti
[3:59:05] <%lewdskeletor13> ETHER SELLER I NEED YOUR FINEST ETHERS please
[3:59:06] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Loved it so much you can't remember
[3:59:07] <%Toynota10> Do you resurrect people with spells or items?
[3:59:10] <OriginalAnnoyer> Nero's devil breakers are pretty good consumables
[3:59:12] <Nina96> @AngriestPat it had limited heals that are very limted
[3:59:13] <%MegboyManuel> fuck did i miss shovel knight???
[3:59:13] <SirDogBear> Thats why those MP sodas in persona games are so vaulable early game
[3:59:13] <derekwst3> Pat how do you play pokemon?
[3:59:16] <Covil91> DMD doesn't have arms on the ground. Only ones you bring in or buy.
[3:59:21] <%Konquerer> i have 999 of each devil breaker and now it won't let me pick them up
[3:59:21] <SidBoyTM> Isn't PoE f2p Diablo?
[3:59:22] <LegendaryDorkKnight> megalixers x99
[3:59:23] <%BioApple> What I want to know is why someone with consumable anxiety would love survival horror, which is a genre primarily about making EVERYTHING a consumable
[3:59:26] <TheRadiantDevil> Fuck fury’s
[3:59:27] <PerrinIsDead> PoE is almost as crazy as Warframe
[3:59:31] <%ElenaManetta> Ok, how about this, do you hate it when a skill tree doesn't have a "Reset skill points but for a fee" option and you're perma stuck with what you choose
[3:59:35] <%bread_assassin> Pat just needs to meet Goblin Slayer. He make the mind goblins go away.
[3:59:35] <DonatelloJose> Shovel knight is indeed dead
[3:59:35] <aimlesshealer> That's impossible
[3:59:36] <%Prevot> LUL
[3:59:37] <%chaumiester> I cannot figure out how to play V in DMC5 i
[3:59:37] <SidBoyTM> If, so I'll have to check it out
[3:59:37] <+NinjaWitaSniper> @AngriestPat I loved using consumables in Dark Souls 1, repair powder after some rounds of pvp felt good to do, or a bone after a boss
[3:59:39] <%spiritofmojave> LUL
[3:59:39] <%MegboyManuel> Did Pat do Shovel knight already???
[3:59:40] <augmentedman> pokemon is for babies
[3:59:40] <arfsm95> @angriestpat if you can buy the consummable back then you're not affraid of using it, because you can farm it
[3:59:41] <%nmaten> do you Billy it?
[3:59:41] <Ion_Laser> LUL
[3:59:42] <%mostundesired> @BioApple It's Pat.
[3:59:43] <natebud> Pat you were right about the Headless. There aren't more of those guys are there?
[3:59:44] <+Grayhammatter> i can just imagine
[3:59:44] <%lewdskeletor13> Divine Confetti sucks
[3:59:46] <%Prevot> NEVER use a pokeball
[3:59:47] <%Agami23> why badly?
[3:59:48] <laveyrin> You never need items in pokemon
[3:59:48] <%Reaped_Psyche> !uptime
[3:59:48] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 59m.
[3:59:50] <vVAstrAVv> pat any tricks for sekiros headless im bad without my dodge
[3:59:50] <LegendaryDorkKnight> sandbagged
[3:59:50] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 4 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 16oz (480mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[3:59:50] <%Faustgesicht> My ethers are too STRONG for you, warrior.
[3:59:51] <SidBoyTM> I would love to see Pat atempt a pokemon nuzlockd
[3:59:53] <lloyddboy> @AngriestPat is that pokemon bet with Paige still on?
[3:59:54] <+unknowingchuck> but its a childs game
[3:59:56] <derekwst3> how are you going to win the bet, if you suck at pokemon?
[4:00:00] <%spiritofmojave> I guess if you don't use items, I could see it
[4:00:01] <Master_Moridin> ya know what. if apparitions are supposed to be endgame, just make it so that you need the mortal blade or some other random upgrade before you can touch them
[4:00:01] <Zombrocom> @natebud There are 5, one for each candy
[4:00:03] <%waifoong98> Pokemin? Just savescum emu it Kappa
[4:00:04] <TheyCallMeVawn> Divine Confetti and Dragon Rot are awful
[4:00:04] <starotter70> With CHEATS
[4:00:08] <%Kirby_Sauce> damn
[4:00:08] <%lewdskeletor13> IMAGINE PAT DOING A NUZLOCKE RUN oh my god
[4:00:09] <rainwater739> break or end of stream?
[4:00:09] <Ion_Laser> LUL LUL
[4:00:12] <Nina96> @AngriestPat can u play hyperlight on stream?
[4:00:13] <+Bloodxb> pat would HATE a nuzlocke
[4:00:17] <natebud> @Zombrocom damn
[4:00:20] <%Toynota10> When you resurrect people in general, do you use spells or items?
[4:00:22] <sosuke5> I thought up a game a while ago when all consumable items, even the limited ones would degrade and become useless over time if not used.
[4:00:22] <joylent_blue> chaumiester one thing that messed me up for a bit, his familiar's directional attacks are dependent on where V is facing, not the familiar itself
[4:00:26] <%chaumiester> I cannot figure out how to play V. there is so much...... delay
[4:00:27] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Pat's done nuzlocke it's called Xcom
[4:00:28] <extradopeness> Pokemon GUVNA
[4:00:30] <%Laecerelius> NEVER buy warframes
[4:00:35] <Redbee2000> Also you can use Dantes clean version if you hold both triggers and bumpers in the character select
[4:00:36] <CSeriesJTYPE> are older dmc games the only games were you'll actively refuse to stock up on healing items
[4:00:41] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> Fury's are the bane of of my existence as V. Came close to death so many times cause of them
[4:00:42] <Arrior_Septem> what about colors?
[4:00:43] <lizard0tm> Getting Chroma Prime is super easy
[4:00:44] <Clyderso> Buy Saryn Prime Kreygasm
[4:00:45] <%Ranryu692> @angriestpat okay
[4:00:46] <+Huderga> NO FUCK OFF Rhino is ass
[4:00:46] <$cureneckbeard> MONEY SALE
[4:00:46] <Nina96> rhino is kinda boring
[4:00:46] <%nmaten> warframes are such a waste of plat
[4:00:49] <DonatelloJose> But @faustgesicht I’m going into battle and I need to restore my MP
[4:00:50] <%Faustgesicht> Prime parts, bro
[4:00:50] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> Save platinum for color pallettes

[4:01:05] <$spardanwarrior> @AngriestPat Speaking of Pokemon and not wanting to use items, I once missed out on catching a shiny legendary because I didn't want to use my Master Ball because I thought I would need it later.

[4:18:01] <dosan121> its hilarious, imagine a band being told to stop and restart constantly
[4:18:02] <+Dragon4234> @AngriestPat I found out that you can just mash buster again for the Hell Caina's animation for the bullet shots so you can still keep charging.
[4:18:02] <triangularblasphemy> Playable Vergil is coming. Don't listen
[4:18:02] <+TimeRewinder1> multiplayer is w/e im suprised people care for that in a DMC game

[4:18:19] <%CerberusDriver> ASSY
[4:18:25] <Covil91> Is your aversion to consumables also why you so rarely Devil Trigger?
[4:18:25] <artoflec> i really need to put nero's gun on a trigger
[4:18:27] <+Bloodxb> we hyped ourselves up too much from datamolines
[4:18:28] <%dukenux> i assume it will come later
[4:18:31] <Nina96> so is the buster arm irrelevant?
[4:18:34] <LegendaryDorkKnight> aw yeahh

[4:18:44] <%deviljhojho94> Pathetic boivin tomatoDevious
[4:18:44] <joylent_blue> Nina96 no, it does astronomically more damage than the bringer does
[4:18:45] <JooseNeck> This BP is easy compared to 4... I got to floor 100 on my first try
[4:18:47] <sukiyakiwestern> bloody palace update honestly kinda disappointing
[4:18:48] <OkamiDude15> so is there no matchmaking in BP?
[4:18:49] <derekwst3> only use devil trigger to heal
[4:18:51] <%ElenaManetta> I tried to side eye chat while playing Gungeon, it is incredibly hard, I don't know how pat is used to it
[4:18:52] <%dukenux> YEET
[4:18:53] <+Dragon4234> @Nina96 No way in heckie Buster Arm does so much more damage
[4:18:54] <%mostundesired> ALL OF TH--
[4:18:57] <%waifoong98> @JooseNeck it is that easy?!?
[4:18:57] <%lewdskeletor13> The whole multiplayer aspect of this game felt very undercooked and pointless
[4:18:58] <%Dr_DangerPhD> @AngriestPat you can mash knuckle while charging showdown so they don't move away
[4:19:02] <Dehlome> why is that even a stage
[4:19:02] <Nina96> @joylent_blue k
[4:19:04] <+bear_breaker20> K im done since this is now spoilers byyyeeeeeee
[4:19:08] <b_ikki> buster arm kills literally every enemy in the game except bosses
[4:19:09] <%deviljhojho94> its not even a palace
[4:19:09] <FenixSeraph> Tentacles are so underwhelming
[4:19:10] <%El_Desperad0> how
[4:19:10] <%connos_livereview> big same
[4:19:10] <dan_g_v> I guess that stage is for HP
[4:19:10] <%rytyoung> That was a stage?
[4:19:10] <%spiritofmojave> Next time you use Judgement, mash RT while you're doing it for some sick punches Kreygasm
[4:19:12] <DemonicCipher> everyone wanted coop and we didnt get it
[4:19:12] <arsonistdaria> shovel knight is intense
[4:19:13] <xBolts4Lifex> Disappointing? Its free!
[4:19:14] <%brickwall35> there's barely any blood or palace
[4:19:15] <derekwst3> it gets harder after 20
[4:19:16] <LegendaryDorkKnight> it's just dmc4 bp again
[4:19:19] <%connos_livereview> apatBig mood
[4:19:20] <+gael_jebidibah> Yeah it's kinda what we expected
[4:19:20] <+Mockisho> Timer Bloody Palace, boo.
[4:19:20] <%Toynota10> @angriestpat when you buster the Empusa Queen and stab with the sword, you can rev your sword
[4:19:21] <T_Sasquatch> @lewdskeletor13 because its a test for a different game .....
[4:19:21] <televisedrevolting> @dehlome Health refill I suppose
[4:19:24] <+khalcipher> what?
[4:19:24] <Tampaoster> I am new to DMC but what do you gain from doing bloody palace
[4:19:24] <b_ikki> Buster Arm is Nero's equivalent to SDT L2
[4:19:28] <%KevinsLunchbox> bloody palace being a disappointment is a apatBig feels bad

[4:19:34] <artoflec> yeah it's way better after 20
[4:19:35] <joylent_blue> nah, its perfectly fine to me, of course i didn't care about multiplayer to begin with
[4:19:37] <Clyderso> LUL
[4:19:38] <+zaworldo> BANG BANG BANG
[4:19:40] <max_radical> why is it a disappointment?
[4:19:43] <b_ikki> it's not
[4:19:44] <+TimeRewinder1> its only dissapointing in the difficulty
[4:19:45] <%xemnahort> When’s urizen?
[4:19:45] <alexandrecau> think you can dt out of grab Pat
[4:19:47] <dan_g_v> look at all these thick butts
[4:19:48] <%lewdskeletor13> Why did this take a month to come out?
[4:19:55] <derekwst3> pat you are sucking
[4:19:56] <b_ikki> debugging
[4:20:03] <LegendaryDorkKnight> is it easy this time around?
[4:20:04] <themechahobo> Is the buster arm irrelevant? No It does 2x damage of normal grab, (DT does 1.5x)
[4:20:06] <triangularblasphemy> Testing and balancing probably
[4:20:09] <Ultimatefool> SourPls
[4:20:14] <JooseNeck> Urizen is floor 98-100
[4:20:16] <sukiyakiwestern> i mean its great, but im not sure why they would make a whole co op system for 2 missions
[4:20:16] <%Toynota10> @tampaoster satisfaction (also a new taunt and and an achievement)
[4:20:18] <%deviljhojho94> YEYEYEYEYEYE

[4:20:23] <%spiritofmojave> Super sexy sexy LUL
[4:20:27] <ScreamingMeat> I think Nico says Super Sassy Sexy
[4:20:30] <triangularblasphemy> Nico is trying
[4:20:31] <%Dr_DangerPhD> testing bloody palace is probably the most time consuming thing ever
[4:20:34] <overlordkog> @AngriestPat Do you think RE2 is gonna get more DLC? Paid or otherwise?
[4:20:38] <freedomboyz> nico saying super sexy sexy is so dumb LUL
[4:20:38] <joylent_blue> LegendaryButcher easier, it gets kinda hard in the last 10 floors or so
[4:20:38] <T_Sasquatch> thats not true, there was a mod to play it on the pc weeks ago
[4:20:39] <%KevinsLunchbox> Nico is a treasure
[4:20:41] <Mangahero18> Go Nico. We love ya
[4:20:42] <sukiyakiwestern> and matt has said probably nothing else which makes it kinda sour
[4:20:42] <DonatelloJose> It’s super SASSY sexy
[4:20:46] <Dr_Mooose> is Nico the announcer?
[4:20:47] <silvcrest> Its Super Sassy Sexy
[4:20:48] <Tampaoster> @Toynota10 Thx man i really did not knew that
[4:20:48] <+Arbal3st> The demons care not for your Showdown
[4:20:51] <%lewdskeletor13> She says Super Sassy Sexy but it really sounds like Super Sexy Sexy
[4:20:56] <SailingSaturn> whelp there goes my Bloody Palace run, Floor 60 cirBlech
[4:20:56] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> It was called Volume 1
[4:20:57] <+HotBloodedHero> Does Ragtime's breakage stop the timer?
[4:20:57] <triangularblasphemy> Like, people will complain about this not being enough, but its exactly what was advertised
[4:21:00] <%deviljhojho94> I wasnt so sure about nico but as soon as the gamea came out I loved her
[4:21:03] <benjiFG> nice max-acts
[4:21:04] <triangularblasphemy> We were expecting SECRET SHIT
[4:21:05] <LegendaryDorkKnight> I hope RE2 gets an Ada campaign
[4:21:08] <+zaworldo> THE DEMons care not for this, Jackpot
[4:21:09] <Artista_AF> Suplex City! 👏 Suplex City! 👏
[4:21:09] <joylent_blue> Akabe literally said there was unannounced DLC plans BabyRage what the fuck
[4:21:10] <%ThatGuyfromMars> I hope they do more RE2 DLC, the stuff that came out was sublime
[4:21:10] <bleugh> how many stages is this? 100?
[4:21:13] <%rytyoung> RE3 is dlc
[4:21:13] <b_ikki> 101
[4:21:14] <joylent_blue> 101
[4:21:15] <%Noahccountingfortaste> 101
[4:21:16] <ofloofy> 101
[4:21:21] <marvel877> Didn't they say work on RE2's already done?
[4:21:26] <b_ikki> played yourself
[4:21:28] <%dukenux> Guys, only the base game promised to exceed expectations
[4:21:29] <%xemnahort> @hotbloodedhero that would be really cool
[4:21:33] <OkamiDude15> 101? wonderful 101 confirmed for ps4
[4:21:36] <+NinjaWitaSniper> @AngriestPat theres a mod to make nico a full style announcer with her own text
[4:21:38] <+PenmanLupine> People are passing judgement like way too early when they've only seen like less than a 3rd of Bloody Palace so far
[4:21:40] <Alseid> Because the secret shit is like 75% in the code already!
[4:21:41] <%Toynota10> RE2 doesn't need anything else
[4:21:42] <thatd00doverthere> wonderful 101??
[4:21:47] <LegendaryDorkKnight> Nico ur baller
[4:21:48] <+bear_breaker20> pat no like ground pound combo?
[4:21:50] <%ElenaManetta> Why Is Pat playing this two-week old game, anyway? Is he trying to kill his stream? Golly
[4:21:50] <ofloofy> The level 40 stage looks hype tho
[4:21:54] <Ultimatefool> I mean, whatever, the base game is one of the best ever, so disappointment is relative
[4:21:58] <triangularblasphemy> Nah, but Bloody Palace is really good IMO
[4:22:00] <FourSwissRollsNothingMore> the more I hear nero's song the more it hurts my brain NotLikeThis
[4:22:01] <%Noahccountingfortaste> I loved BP, finished Nero and trying V tonight
[4:22:03] <+Tokanova> you know what'd be cool? if bloody palace had pvp instead of co-op
[4:22:10] <zargy> I want a Nico cover of Devil Trigger
[4:22:13] <joylent_blue> i LOVE that you can replay any floor any time you want after you've clear it
[4:22:20] <%Tucker0603> combo B is my favorite
[4:22:21] <joylent_blue> especially the boss levels
[4:22:23] <%thackattack00> pvp in a game like this would be awful
[4:22:23] <%mostundesired> I didn't know Nero knew Seismic Toss
[4:22:23] <%CerberusDriver> small package driver
[4:22:24] <artoflec> yeah its good for practice
[4:22:30] <triangularblasphemy> Bloody Palace PVP sounds good until you fight a decent V player
[4:22:31] <Redbee2000> I've beaten it with Dante and V its pretty standard with a few actual bs choke points
[4:22:31] <%rytyoung> DMC is still strong for twitch numbers
[4:22:33] <triangularblasphemy> then life is pain
[4:22:33] <themechahobo> DMC pvp would be the worst.
[4:22:34] <Mangahero18> Not to jinx him (but I totally wanna jinx him) but Pat is doing really well.
[4:22:35] <LegendaryDorkKnight> imagine a pvp final boss LUL
[4:22:35] <%Agami23> I feel like bloody palace actively punishes you for doing taunts.
[4:22:35] <%lewdskeletor13> The music issue is something they really should’ve thought of before they shipped this update
[4:22:35] <T_Sasquatch> @joylent_blue really ?? where
[4:22:41] <%CerberusDriver> PVP sounds like an awful idea in a game like DMC
[4:22:42] <thatd00doverthere> CANCEL THE RUN I
[4:22:47] <joylent_blue> T_Sasquatch in the "warm up" option on the BP main menu
[4:22:48] <+Dragon4234> Surprise surprise getting excited over data mined info that's never been mentioned anywhere else lead to being disappointed with a bonus mode.
[4:22:49] <Dio_TR> @elenamanetta there are people who genuinely think that and that's Sad
[4:22:50] <b_ikki> yeah pvp would suck
[4:22:53] <%Hilleltaco> I don't know if I'm crazy or what but I'm not really feelin Nero's combo B in this game
[4:22:56] <joylent_blue> SHIT YEAH
[4:22:56] <Dehlome> shit yeah
[4:22:56] <Megapikman132> people don't want pvp, they want co-op
[4:22:58] <ZippyPsycho> SHIT YEAH
[4:22:58] <%Tucker0603> lol
[4:23:01] <%Toynota10> Yo so is Dante to broken to be put into a fighting game now?
[4:23:04] <%spiritofmojave> I didn't know that, huh
[4:23:06] <LegendaryDorkKnight> such a soft ddt
[4:23:11] <+TimeRewinder1> It's the delay
[4:23:12] <%weissguard> It's probably Nero channeling his inner R. Mika. LUL
[4:23:15] <triangularblasphemy> @Dragon4234 Yeah exactly. I wonder how game devs feel about that one
[4:23:19] <JooseNeck> I'm a little disappointed that Nidhogg, Geryan, and Nightmare aren't bosses in this
[4:23:20] <%MegboyManuel> Itsnot a DDT, it's a brain buster
[4:23:21] <sukiyakiwestern> the missions get longer so the music isnt as much of an issue
[4:23:21] <+bear_breaker20> @CerberusDriver all the more reason to have itKappa
[4:23:23] <%salty_syd913> yoooo
[4:23:24] <%Piemen99> nice
[4:23:25] <%Halowood> Combo B is his best combo
[4:23:25] <benjiFG> shcum
[4:23:27] <+SWindleFeD> @AngriestPat it's because he doesn't slam down his sword the same way he did in dmc4
[4:23:28] <%dukenux> PogChamp
[4:23:28] <%KevinsLunchbox> how is it pat only got to 19 if we're at 14 so easily?
[4:23:29] <alexandrecau> can you just taunt after the buster for the knee thing or it's different input
[4:23:29] <+TimeRewinder1> it has too much delay now
[4:23:37] <%ThatGuyfromMars> can you only play as nero in bloody palace?
[4:23:39] <%MegboyManuel> Maybe even a muscle buster. But deffo not a DDT
[4:23:41] <raveous> well dante was in one of the most broken fighting games, UMVC3 and he was high tier
[4:23:45] <%lewdskeletor13> No Mars
[4:23:45] <aimlesshealer> LUL
[4:23:46] <LegendaryDorkKnight> such a soft brain buster then jeez

[4:23:48] <joylent_blue> KevinTurtle 19 is fury i think?
[4:23:51] <triangularblasphemy> @MegboyManuel You can play as all three characters
[4:23:52] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> PogChamp
[4:23:56] <benjiFG> did Pat say combo B or combo D?
[4:23:58] <Megapikman132> @ThatGuyfromMars No. Everyone is playable.

[4:23:59] <GandhiTheTerrible> BRRRRRING
[4:24:00] <joylent_blue> KevinsLunchbox 19 is fury i think?
[4:24:00] <thatd00doverthere> THE MAX ACTS
[4:24:02] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Max Acts all around Kreygasm
[4:24:02] <raveous> all those max act sounds Kreygasm
[4:24:03] <konami2010> holy fuck those exceeds
[4:24:05] <%mostundesired> I've seen this hentai before
[4:24:06] <marvel877> I really like the buster on this and on fury.
[4:24:06] <Nina96> nice

[4:24:08] <%nmaten> that does stupid damage

[4:24:14] <%spiritofmojave> A+ dude
[4:24:19] <+Arbal3st> Showdown is so beast
[4:24:22] <%rytyoung> B fat bat
[4:24:23] <ofloofy> Pat you should use your devil knuckle when your in idle animations for extra dps
[4:24:24] <zargy> Does anyone else think Nero's devil form looks super cute?
[4:24:25] <joylent_blue> KevinsLunchbox its the fuck you enemy LUL
[4:24:25] <shoutoflightning> Honestly his busters in 5 just don't have the same flair as the ones in 4
[4:24:29] <+bear_breaker20> i like to save it for the very last jobber <3
[4:24:31] <LiquidMathew> I can't believe that Nero's one taunt is how he blocks Dante and Vergil from killing each other
[4:24:32] <%KevinsLunchbox> gotcha, sounds like fun
[4:24:33] <%lewdskeletor13> Fury’s are dumb fucking weeb lizards
[4:24:36] <thatd00doverthere> I feel like it doesn't stun as much as it did in 4
[4:24:36] <+roronoapedro> Pat, what's your favorite enemy?
[4:24:40] <AttentionPelican> @alexandrecau he auto does it if you dont cancel it too soon
[4:24:43] <joylent_blue> LiquidMathew yooooooooo
[4:24:44] <LegendaryDorkKnight> he looks like onimusha 3 samanosuke powered up
[4:24:49] <Nina96> @AngriestPat really i always found it easy to get
[4:24:56] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@triangularblasphemy) (warning)
[4:24:58] <marvel877> Put them in an armbar!
[4:24:59] <Dr_Mooose> hate these enemies
[4:25:01] <Clyderso> G O O D S H I T
[4:25:04] <%spiritofmojave> GOOD SHIT
[4:25:06] <%KevinsLunchbox> Cody Rhodes going hard
[4:25:08] <triangularblasphemy> You can parry nobodies when they put on the mask
[4:25:08] <sileo_patronus> We can tell
[4:25:12] <joylent_blue> you gotta touch 'em a lil' bit and go
[4:25:14] <thatd00doverthere> ARMBAR
[4:25:15] <%Hilleltaco> The eyeballs mess me up so bad
[4:25:16] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> id rather fight 15 nobodies at once than 3 fury's
[4:25:17] <%TheQButton> same though
[4:25:19] <aimlesshealer> Giant lasers are always good shit. Fact.
[4:25:20] <thatd00doverthere> Chris Jericho classic
[4:25:21] <+maglewood> Nobodies are hard
[4:25:22] <%filialpails> XION DID NOTHING WRONG
[4:25:22] <triangularblasphemy> JUST before they put it on, you can block it
[4:25:23] <%chubbypencil> I love mashing knuckle with helterskelter
[4:25:29] <T_Sasquatch> my most hated enemies are Nobodies > Behemots > Bats > Fury
[4:25:32] <JooseNeck> There's a floor with 3 Fury simultaneously... I can't imagine what that'd be like as V NotLikeThis
[4:25:33] <%spiritofmojave> I'll take the Nobodies in Bloody Palace over the Empusa Queens. They SPAM those fuckers later
[4:25:34] <%ElenaManetta> The white flash is actually death on the eyes, I had to make Twitch tiny
[4:25:35] <themechahobo> How to beat Fury with Nero: charge shot him as he is rising up, then BreakAge Buster the Fury on the ground (he will wait). Instant win.
[4:25:36] <triangularblasphemy> do it twice, and their AI disables. They go full coward
[4:25:37] <Alseid> Pat hates the enemies that were CLEARLY designed for RE
[4:25:37] <ScatterCatt> Wait! Bloody Palace came out today?!
[4:25:39] <AlasterAngelo> Judecca > Fury
[4:25:41] <%Dr_DangerPhD> @Damashi_The_Kaotic rawhide devil breaker works really well against them
[4:25:42] <AlasterAngelo> fuck those things
[4:25:42] <benjiFG> @AngriestPat what button do you have for knuckle if you put gun on R2?
[4:25:43] <VHLW> @JooseNeck it was pretty easy actually
[4:25:44] <marvel877> Call that thing Rhonda Rousey cuz they Nobody.
[4:25:44] <Mangahero18> Enemies that cant be stunned are just as annoying in DMC as in Dark Souls
[4:25:44] <derekwst3> i hate these guys, im so bad at them
[4:25:47] <%lewdskeletor13> Bloody Palace just feels really barebones to me, especially since it came out a month after release.
[4:25:52] <Dreamedlint> I hate Furies.
[4:25:55] <+silverback129> How do I fight Furies
[4:25:56] <LegendaryDorkKnight> that's a big thing you got there but I dont like it when men play rough -Ada Re4
[4:25:57] <AlasterAngelo> I hate Furries
[4:25:57] <joylent_blue> you cannot buster them like that
[4:25:58] <%waifoong98> I would rather blitz
[4:25:58] <+FennecZephyr> I still can't unhear Nico's style callout as "Surfer Sexy"
[4:25:59] <T_Sasquatch> fury is just annoying
[4:26:04] <RiverBirch> So what happens to the buster arm when you already
[4:26:08] <RiverBirch> y'know, get buster
[4:26:09] <Zanzaken> Did pat just start?
[4:26:12] <Megapikman132> They need to be prone or in the air first
[4:26:14] <ScreamingMeat> Furies must be a Nightmare with V LUL
[4:26:15] <%mostundesired> LUL
[4:26:15] <joylent_blue> yeah Zanzaken
[4:26:16] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> i generally don't play Nero. Mainly stick to Dante and V, and fight fury's sucks as V
[4:26:18] <triangularblasphemy> @RiverBirch Its stronger than your normal
[4:26:18] <zargy> Just Dodge
[4:26:18] <Zanzaken> Coo
[4:26:18] <Rexenexus> Just charge shot bro lol
[4:26:18] <+roronoapedro> Punch Line.
[4:26:19] <marvel877> Oh, yay, Fury. Buster on this is cool, but fighting it is annoying.
[4:26:19] <AlasterAngelo> play Dante instead
[4:26:19] <%KevinsLunchbox> just gotta let it out
[4:26:20] <%nmaten> fighting furys as nero fucking sucks
[4:26:20] <JooseNeck> Ragtime Break Age vs Fury is amazing
[4:26:20] <LegendaryDorkKnight> nico speak wierd
[4:26:21] <redial_nick> git gud
[4:26:22] <%Noahccountingfortaste> @RiverBirch the breaker is MUCH stronger
[4:26:22] <derekwst3> bloody palace starts slow but the enemies do get harder
[4:26:23] <b_ikki> gotta knock them down to buster them. High roller them @AngriestPat
[4:26:23] <+bear_breaker20> thought this was sekiro Kappa
[4:26:23] <AlasterAngelo> or clash them
[4:26:23] <+TheoTTree> Flatten them
[4:26:24] <alexandrecau> shoot after teleport
[4:26:26] <+TheoTTree> YE
[4:26:27] <thatd00doverthere> parry hin
[4:26:28] <%Agami23> swing your sword??
[4:26:28] <Dreamedlint> Furry furies are the ultimate evil.
[4:26:28] <Covil91> Doesn't helter skelter clash? @AngriestPat
[4:26:29] <joylent_blue> someone needs to lab furies
[4:26:29] <reinbachthe3rd> We doing Bloody Palace?
[4:26:30] <+zaworldo> YO
[4:26:30] <RiverBirch> Fair enough
[4:26:31] <%dukenux> gotta let it out
[4:26:32] <%salty_syd913> YO
[4:26:33] <LiquidMathew> @RiverBirch Buster Arm is much stronger than Regular buster
[4:26:34] <triangularblasphemy> Fury is easy with Dante at least
[4:26:35] <%waifoong98> Dante just makes enemy in this game a joke
[4:26:35] <%Niney_Who> YEYEYE
[4:26:35] <+Prinny_Raider> this enemy is super hard to deal with on later levels
[4:26:36] <Nina96> Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm
[4:26:37] <%Konquerer> just dodge
[4:26:37] <Megapikman132> @AngriestPat They need to be prone or in the air. Then you can buster them for most of their health
[4:26:37] <+EdViper> god damn the fury buster is the coolest
[4:26:39] <%cherubs_anonymous> That buster's still fucking raw
[4:26:39] <%Brentsei> YEYEYE
[4:26:40] <OriginalAnnoyer> I just punchlined that guy
[4:26:42] <+HotBloodedHero> Timed parries and air combos
[4:26:42] <%lewdskeletor13> I feel like the April’s Fools video they did yesterday had more going on than this Bloody Palace update
[4:26:42] <ofloofy> Pary it when it fades away
[4:26:43] <wolvenelf> too bad you dont have ragtime JonCarnage
[4:26:45] <Redbee2000> the endings are pretty cool tho
[4:26:46] <VHLW> at least it's not blitz
[4:26:46] <AttentionPelican> @RiverBirch The buster arm does way more damage and the breakage has super armor and even more damage
[4:26:46] <Megapikman132> I labbed it out the other night.
[4:26:48] <Nina96> u hit the thing
[4:26:48] <%Agami23> use your sword pat
[4:26:48] <Rexenexus> just dodge and charge shot looool 4Head
[4:26:49] <joylent_blue> Nero has a number of options with furies
[4:26:51] <%Dr_DangerPhD> @silverback129 you need to clash an attack to put them into a damageable state, use rawhide spam or shuffle
[4:26:51] <derekwst3> shoot and jump
[4:26:51] <%Konquerer> you're gonna love floor 70
[4:26:52] <+Dragon4234> @AngriestPat Wait till you fight three of them at the same time
[4:26:52] <%daisyyyy> This song is dangerous to listen to while driving
[4:26:54] <dan_g_v> well, do the opposite of what you have been doing so far!
[4:26:54] <%skizzuto> rawhide to clash when it attacks?
[4:26:54] <benjiFG> use the void and learn its attack patterns, there are only three
[4:26:55] <themechahobo> I'll say it again How to beat Fury with Nero: charge shot him as he is rising up, then BreakAge Buster the Fury on the ground (he will wait). Instant win.
[4:26:56] <+silverback129> Floor 70 has 3 at once.__.
[4:26:56] <b_ikki> blitz is way easier to deal with lol
[4:26:58] <%Halowood> Clash or a well timed Gerbera/Overture
[4:26:59] <%waifoong98> time your sword parry LUL
[4:27:00] <extradopeness> Its rough
[4:27:02] <RiverBirch> 4 people @'d with the info
[4:27:05] <%ElenaManetta> Do you hate looking up the answers on videos and want to figure it out for yourself?
[4:27:05] <+ninjapenguin1414> @AngriestPat Rawhide wrecks fury's
[4:27:05] <%Brentsei> the air one is real cool too
[4:27:06] <TheBlankAce> Punchline is good because it tracks and ragtime just stops them
[4:27:08] <marvel877> Dante works better with Furies, but even then, I'm just spamming Cerebus' Revolver.
[4:27:08] <%Noahccountingfortaste> @themechahobo basically what I do, yeah
[4:27:09] <RiverBirch> Good community
[4:27:09] <triangularblasphemy> Do a short hop over the dual slash float attack
[4:27:11] <T_Sasquatch> use your arms, dumb helterskelter
[4:27:11] <Zanzaken> Parry him with something really active like an EX shuffle.
[4:27:12] <Dreamedlint> Try for lucky helm splitters.
[4:27:16] <triangularblasphemy> minimum hieght, then retaliate
[4:27:16] <+FennecZephyr> @AngriestPat Rawhide trivialized Furies
[4:27:18] <triangularblasphemy> its hard
[4:27:21] <JooseNeck> I save Ragtime for Fury and use Break Age
[4:27:22] <derekwst3> use this time to heal
[4:27:24] <%Toynota10> You see how you're table hopping? I stead of that, party with sword
[4:27:26] <+emVulpine> Rawhide works wonders.
[4:27:30] <+Nthenorm> i just did the floor 70 one, but i cheesed it with sin dt
[4:27:30] <%Hilleltaco> I honestly don't really like Fury as an enemy, I feel like dealing with them is almost pure trial and error because of how unclear the timing is before practice
[4:27:30] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@chubbypencil) (warning)
[4:27:31] <Megapikman132> @AngriestPat They need to be prone or in the air. Then you can buster them for most of their health. I was labbing it the other night.
[4:27:32] <%spiritofmojave> Rawhide or Ragtime are perfect for dealing with Furies
[4:27:34] <derekwst3> devil trigger your life
[4:27:37] <%spiritofmojave> If you can't nail the clangs
[4:27:37] <coreybom> fury's are nightmare
[4:27:39] <+bear_breaker20> gerbera works well against teleporter no?
[4:27:40] <%NopeBadguy> @AngriestPat hard way armors thought attacks, a lot of arms are really good at parrying or stuffing attacks, he'll always attack when the animation before is an unsheathe, otherwise, he'll move around
[4:27:43] <joylent_blue> @AngriestPat if you know when its spawning you can streak it onto its back and buster arm it to OHKO
[4:27:46] <%Dr_DangerPhD> @AngriestPat use the backdash invincibility on shuffle to make furies way easier to deal with
[4:27:48] <Zanzaken> Parry you can do ahead of time
[4:27:52] <Megapikman132> shuffle also is good for parrys
[4:27:54] <derekwst3> boss time
[4:27:56] <Dreamedlint> Shuffle is good on reaction.
[4:28:00] <LegendaryDorkKnight> lvl3 launcher would do it
[4:28:00] <extradopeness> Rawhide and Ragtime yeah
[4:28:01] <+TimeRewinder1> spamming split works
[4:28:02] <+Dragon4234> @AngriestPat Shuffle's the shit
[4:28:03] <%Noahccountingfortaste> @bear_breaker20 yes, gerbera while charging a shot and hit them after an attack
[4:28:05] <Dehlome> I see why stage 19 was your record
[4:28:06] <b_ikki> man skelter sucks ass
[4:28:09] <benjiFG> he said fuck D:
[4:28:09] <%lewdskeletor13> Ghost Survivors actually felt creative and fun to play for me with new enemy variations, this update feels very bland. Idk if I’m just nuts
[4:28:14] <+TheoTTree> I'd suggest hit up the void and learn their combos. Furies are actually very predictable unlike Blitz @AngriestPat
[4:28:20] <ScreamingMeat> Bloody Palace has effectively made the Red Orb DLC utterly pointless
[4:28:25] <ofloofy> Rawhides the furies cant get through at all i find it helps well to parry with its big hitbox
[4:28:29] <%dukenux> Don't FUCK with this Dead Weight!
[4:28:30] <JooseNeck> Has anyone else in chat parried a Fury with V's cane?
[4:28:30] <%ThatGuyfromMars> man nico is the best
[4:28:32] <joylent_blue> yeah Furies are very predictable once you get used to them
[4:28:33] <triangularblasphemy> And people were worried about red orb dlc
[4:28:33] <aimlesshealer> Nero's DT is so great
[4:28:37] <derekwst3> yeah you can pile blood orbs easy here
[4:28:50] <triangularblasphemy> power...MY POWER
[4:28:51] <Mangahero18> I wish there was just a pure Boss Rush mode in the game. With like every boss having one or two new moves. That would be great.
[4:28:56] <Zanzaken> @ScreamingMeat Dr. Faust already made the orb DLC point less doe.
[4:28:57] <+TimeRewinder1> its not like they removed the faust thing either
[4:29:02] <LegendaryDorkKnight> you can party his fireballs
[4:29:16] <%KevinsLunchbox> SSS
[4:29:17] <+TheoTTree> The explosion missed
[4:29:17] <GandhiTheTerrible> face
[4:29:17] <triangularblasphemy> party those fireballs. party em all night
[4:29:18] <+TimeRewinder1> 10-20 minutes of that will set you up just fine lol
[4:29:18] <%KevinsLunchbox> aw
[4:29:19] <derekwst3> all im missing is the special ex taunts and two moves from dante
[4:29:19] <ScreamingMeat> @Zanzaken Even more pointless
[4:29:21] <%waifoong98> how did you die to this bastard the last time????
[4:29:22] <+Jv9ufxcy> woohoo pizza party
[4:29:23] <+roronoapedro> Gotta hit him in the head.
[4:29:26] <deathsmions1> do the charged moves always break the breakers?
[4:29:27] <themechahobo> Ragtime (BreakAge) also works well no Furies. Especially when there is say 4 of them.
[4:29:28] <ofloofy> you can parry fireballs with gerbera too
[4:29:28] <%mastertwin2> SourPls
[4:29:29] <thatd00doverthere> fun fact if you break the building earlier it won't be there in bloody palace
[4:29:29] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> I swear this part of the song sounds like Bison's theme
[4:29:30] <ofloofy> its hype
[4:29:31] <%KevinsLunchbox> wahoo pizza pizza
[4:29:34] <LegendaryDorkKnight> parry sorry autocorrect
[4:29:43] <joylent_blue> Mangahero18 you can manually select the boss floors in BP and just fight those, its not an actual boss rush, and its not all the bosses, but eh
[4:29:45] <Prism_Wing> Party woohoo pizza those fireballs SwiftRage
[4:29:46] <b_ikki> @deathsmions1 unless you break them during a cutscene yes
[4:29:46] <CrimsonGargoyle> anyone else find his boss theme to be very arcade-gamey?
[4:29:47] <derekwst3> summon nightmare
[4:29:48] <JooseNeck> Enemy Step as Nero trivializes this boss
[4:29:52] <alexandrecau> crap
[4:29:52] <%NopeBadguy> does bp use the sos or dmd versions of bosses/enemies
[4:29:58] <ofloofy> enemystep is godlike
[4:29:59] <joylent_blue> NopeBadguy both
[4:30:03] <%lewdskeletor13> @sphincter_spelunker I think you said that before too LUL or I remember someone saying something similar
[4:30:04] <ofloofy> so easy in this game
[4:30:04] <%dukenux> ZA WARUDO
[4:30:07] <%NopeBadguy> @joylent_blue when does it transition
[4:30:09] <%Noahccountingfortaste> @NopeBadguy depends on the floor
[4:30:10] <%rytyoung> Nico is life
[4:30:12] <Mangahero18> Yea I know. Not as cool.
[4:30:15] <Redbee2000> does anyone consider bloody palace stuff spoilers cause there is one thing thats really cool and annoying
[4:30:20] <lloyddboy> S U C C
[4:30:23] <joylent_blue> NopeBadguy 60-80 is SoS i think, 80+ is DMD
[4:30:25] <Admiral_PopnFresh> POWER PogChamp
[4:30:25] <+Dragon4234> @NopeBadguy It's dependent on floor SoS starts in floor 40 I think
[4:30:26] <%dukenux> nah
[4:30:27] <%cherubs_anonymous> P O W E R
[4:30:35] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @lewdskeletor13 I DID say it before. No one knew what I was talking about D:
[4:30:36] <triangularblasphemy> 80+ sure is DMD
[4:30:36] <b_ikki> yeah dmd starts at 80
[4:30:37] <%NopeBadguy> @joylent_blue ty
[4:30:40] <Artista_AF> i dunno why i thought Nero's DT would be just "hey you can Break-Arts as much as you want as long you have DT bar zoneThink
[4:30:41] <%FrustratedAF> 🤔 needs more hoodie
[4:30:44] <LegendaryDorkKnight> parry
[4:30:46] <triangularblasphemy> Stupid DT EVERYTHING
[4:30:48] <b_ikki> reflect coward
[4:30:59] <dan_g_v> reflect is for cowards
[4:31:04] <%Dr_DangerPhD> @triangularblasphemy yup, didn't get far enough to see if enemies DT though
[4:31:05] <+silverback129> USE DT COWARD
[4:31:12] <joylent_blue> ??
[4:31:13] <LegendaryDorkKnight> true heroes reflect
[4:31:15] <derekwst3> kill him, you can go in, you gain your life back
[4:31:18] <joylent_blue> the heck
[4:31:18] <dan_g_v> but what if he needs his DT on another floor?
[4:31:20] <%Tucker0603> the fuck?
[4:31:23] <+Flarepulse> bawler
[4:31:24] <triangularblasphemy> @Dr_DangerPhD I barely made it far enough, but yeah they sure do.
[4:31:25] <thatd00doverthere> now THIS is pod racing
[4:31:29] <joylent_blue> KABALLIN
[4:31:30] <%CerberusDriver> @AngriestPat swing your sword when the red mist starts to disappear for Furies
[4:31:30] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> How can this be
[4:31:32] <CrimsonGargoyle> LUL
[4:31:35] <%filialpails> HOW CAN THIS BE
[4:31:36] <benjiFG> @AngriestPat what button do you use for knuckle if you have gun on R2?
[4:31:36] <%Noahccountingfortaste> congrats
[4:31:40] <derekwst3> now to step up the difficulty
[4:31:41] <%YaBoiShamoi> uka uka is free. no. it cannot be
[4:31:43] <bsmusic> POG
[4:31:44] <Tampaoster> Not that many arms left
[4:31:45] <Redbee2000> The taunt Dante gets makes me wonder about the Vergil situation
[4:31:45] <Megapikman132> YEAH
[4:31:47] <ofloofy> PAUSE MODE
[4:31:47] <Nina96> really?
[4:31:48] <triangularblasphemy> @Dr_DangerPhD Hope you hate stunlocking enemies :/
[4:31:49] <joylent_blue> you didn't know?
[4:31:50] <%Dr00_PhD> Square
[4:31:50] <%waifoong98> EZ mode heh...
[4:31:50] <%spiritofmojave> YEP
[4:31:51] <joylent_blue> :D
[4:31:53] <OkamiDude15> thats neat
[4:31:58] <+TimeRewinder1> aslong as you make sure to hit continue after
[4:31:59] <Artista_AF> PogChamp
[4:32:02] <b_ikki> only real use it
[4:32:04] <%Toynota10> whax
[4:32:09] <%brickwall35> is Bloody Palace the fastest way to farm red orbs?
[4:32:14] <%Toynota10> what did the message say I missed it
[4:32:16] <%Noahccountingfortaste> also helpful to knuckle if you are getting hit
[4:32:17] <thatd00doverthere> it sure is
[4:32:17] <Dreamedlint> i really want Pat to make it to 60
[4:32:17] <joylent_blue> i really like that you can just walk around the boss rooms in this
[4:32:18] <scrumbotime> A real master can Exceed AND knuckle a whole combo
[4:32:19] <b_ikki> no not the fastest
[4:32:19] <benjiFG> neat
[4:32:19] <%Noahccountingfortaste> for the interrupts
[4:32:20] <ScreamingMeat> I forgot Knuckle was a thing
[4:32:22] <joylent_blue> great for photo mode
[4:32:24] <LegendaryDorkKnight> it always is
[4:32:25] <+bear_breaker20> too many names for so many moves...
[4:32:26] <b_ikki> fastest is still m13 faust hat
[4:32:27] <%Dr_DangerPhD> @AngriestPat you can also use knuckle while riding punchline as well
[4:32:28] <ScreamingMeat> It's cool tho
[4:32:29] <aimlesshealer> I hope Nero gets more dumb arms every game
[4:32:31] <%Agami23> the fastest is faust in mission 13
[4:32:32] <ofloofy> you get Thousands for boss battles @brickwall35
[4:32:33] <triangularblasphemy> knuckle does not work with my fingers
[4:32:35] <KingVantq> Faust is still the fastest
[4:32:36] <alexandrecau> @brickwall35 it's pretty fast but being good with faust is better
[4:32:41] <triangularblasphemy> Fingers... I NEED MORE FINGERS
[4:32:50] <derekwst3> yes its easy to farm red orbs, but use faust during it
[4:32:50] <b_ikki> but if you want it to be more fun then a BP run will give you like a million orbs
[4:32:51] <triangularblasphemy> And on that day, a voice called to me...
[4:32:51] <OkamiDude15> @Toynota10 you can save your floor on BP if you want to take a break and continue at a later time
[4:32:52] <JooseNeck> Nero is so fucking good in this game.. but just imagine what he'd be like with inertia Kreygasm
[4:32:52] <RiverBirch> b-but tomboy
[4:32:55] <LegendaryDorkKnight> need more dingus
[4:32:55] <%CerberusDriver> Now its gonna get harder
[4:32:56] <+Dragon4234> @AngriestPat I put buster on circle/B because I played DmC4 like a loser
[4:33:00] <dan_g_v> @triangularblasphemy that's what Kirie said :3
[4:33:02] <aimlesshealer> He'll look like one of them hindu deities
[4:33:03] <SmarkyMC> does buster arm even have a use after beating the game?
[4:33:04] <T_Sasquatch> lytCRAZY
[4:33:08] <alexandrecau> got like 300000 rorbs with V on bloody palcae because of the no damage bonus
[4:33:11] <42nfl19> Can you use DLC arms here?
[4:33:14] <T_Sasquatch> lytCANDY
[4:33:17] <Redbee2000> nope
[4:33:20] <mr_ESB> Is it a devil breaker refill every 20 floors?
[4:33:21] <RiverBirch> @SmarkyMC Buster Arm is stronger than your demon buster
[4:33:25] <triangularblasphemy> @dan_g_v Oh for sure. Probably because she has zero fingers. Probably because she's a ghost
[4:33:25] <extradopeness> Tomboy comes in REAL handy here tho
[4:33:29] <%Agami23> does rawhide make the grab with the robot arm longer than the grab with the arm arm?
[4:33:30] <SmarkyMC> oh ok
[4:33:35] <Aerodozz> Is that a custom stylish voice mod?
[4:33:39] <%Toynota10> you out break away on D-pad?
[4:33:40] <OkamiDude15> @SmarkyMC buster arm does more damage than normal buster and the break age gives you invincibility during the animation
[4:33:41] <b_ikki> @SmarkyMC yes its break age deals more damage than the health of any DMD normal enemy
[4:33:42] <extradopeness> Hellbats suck
[4:33:43] <KingVantq> @42nfl19 dlc stuff isnt in BP
[4:33:43] <ofloofy> sadly no pasta breaker or sweet release in bloody palace
[4:33:45] <Redbee2000> @mr_esb its every ten
[4:33:50] <joylent_blue> Aerodozz its the Nico announcer from deluxe edition
[4:33:52] <T_Sasquatch> @Aerodozz no , dlc
[4:33:53] <dan_g_v> @triangularblasphemy but then, where do you use more fingers?
[4:33:53] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> rawhide does extend the wire snatch, yeah
[4:33:53] <LiquidMathew> @Agami23 both get upgraded iirc
[4:33:54] <+Dragon4234> @Agami23 No but it upgrades it to pull in heavier enemies
[4:33:59] <derekwst3> yeah enemies will start to appear a little after the others now
[4:34:05] <Aerodozz> @joylent_blue @t_sasquatch ah gotcha
[4:34:06] <%spiritofmojave> Is it true V trivializes a majority of the palace? Haven't played him yet
[4:34:08] <JooseNeck> I never really use Rawhide
[4:34:13] <+TheoTTree> So you guys ever notice how Sword parries are all over this game? When they barely existed in the others?
[4:34:14] <%mostundesired> apatDab
[4:34:14] <LegendaryDorkKnight> powah bomb
[4:34:14] <triangularblasphemy> @dan_g_v Two words: JAZZ HANDS
[4:34:16] <Tampaoster> No pat dont break the age

[4:34:17] <+Robopengy> How is Bloody Palace so far?
[4:34:19] <mr_ESB> Ooh every 10 floors should definitely be helpful
[4:34:20] <ScreamingMeat> Woolie wonders why any of the other Devilbreakers exist because all he needs is Tomboy and Buster Arm

[4:34:35] <+Bloodxb> the best room
[4:34:36] <TheBlankAce> Yeah all the bat stages blow
[4:34:37] <Darmarock> MercyWing1 LUL MercyWing2
[4:34:37] <%Toynota10> NiCO's buster arm's super useless now lol
[4:34:38] <%Dr_DangerPhD> @TheSpiritof2277 the only problem with V is that he doesn't have a reliable way to heal himself like the others do with DT
[4:34:38] <Prism_Wing> Bloody Palace looks alot like the Nightmare Frontier, now that I think about it.
[4:34:39] <T_Sasquatch> @TheSpiritof2277 he is good early then gets absolutely fucked after a while
[4:34:41] <themechahobo> What!? No DevilBreaker HAS to go on a shoulder button, because BreakAge all day every day.
[4:34:42] <triangularblasphemy> not the bats NOT THE BATS AAAAAAAAHHHHH
[4:34:42] <extradopeness> Tomboy REAL gud here
[4:34:44] <42nfl19> Why would you use a robot busters arm when you can use your demon arm?
[4:34:45] <%Hilleltaco> @TheSpiritof2277 Definitely feels easier to me, I almost beat it on my first try
[4:34:46] <wolvenelf> fight baaaats
[4:34:47] <derekwst3> yeah i hate the one with 6 red bats later
[4:34:49] <b_ikki> you're supposed to use the fire bat to kill the others LUL
[4:34:49] <+DannyBucko231> Ohh literally welcome to hell O_O
[4:34:50] <joylent_blue> Toynota10 nooooo, it does a shitload more damage than the bringer
[4:34:51] <LegendaryDorkKnight> my eyessss
[4:34:52] <Megapikman132> calibur is your friend
[4:34:53] <+Enryuan> Fun timee with the fiery zubats
[4:34:55] <LiquidMathew> @Toynota10 it does waaayyyy more damage than regular buster
[4:35:00] <%lewdskeletor13> FLYING ENEMIES ARE THE WORST I hate them
[4:35:01] <RiverBirch> god
[4:35:05] <extradopeness> RawHide even better
[4:35:05] <xxshadowxx416> more coming
[4:35:06] <RiverBirch> would V even do well here?
[4:35:09] <%Zamorouskiwhich> 3. Not 4 apatDab
[4:35:11] <SmarkyMC> still wish it was like dmc3's jermaPluto
[4:35:13] <ofloofy> V plays well here
[4:35:14] <%dukenux> I can't imagine how it looks with V
[4:35:14] <+kaniasaurus> why ever choose buster when nero has it permanently in endgame?
[4:35:16] <Tampaoster> Bang bang bang
[4:35:17] <%spiritofmojave> Sounds like a lot of his issues with the higher difficulties, thanks guys for the info
[4:35:18] <derekwst3> next up is lizards
[4:35:19] <%Toynota10> @liquidmathew on it's own or with break age?
[4:35:20] <%connos_livereview> SURE WOULD BE NICE IF IT WAS MORE THAN 3 THo
[4:35:24] <extradopeness> V ez modo
[4:35:26] <LegendaryDorkKnight> dmc4se had 5 :(
[4:35:26] <bleugh> where's vergil nyannKIMOI
[4:35:28] <JanusII> V is actually real easy here most of the time.
[4:35:29] <%Tucker0603> I really hope if we get the ladies night they bring back Gloria costume
[4:35:29] <LiquidMathew> @Toynota10 both
[4:35:29] <joylent_blue> kaniasaurus the buster arm does wayyyy more damage
[4:35:31] <alexandrecau> @RiverBirch surprisingly yes
[4:35:31] <KingVantq> @RiverBirch got to stage 60 on V my first run
[4:35:34] <+reddpop_> @kaniasaurus its a better buster
[4:35:34] <b_ikki> Yeah and I always turn it back on PunOko
[4:35:37] <ChloeFleurage> after like a 50-ish minute run that reached floor 90 I had earned like 870k-ish not counting rorbs from enemies so its not like its a trivial source of red orbs at all, every 20 floors has a proper boss and every 10 has a slightly harder challenge until floor 80 where 80 90 and 100 all have proper bosses
[4:35:39] <dan_g_v> it would be nice if you could have 3 lovely ladies in there too
[4:35:39] <derekwst3> never mind they are after these
[4:35:44] <%CerberusDriver> dont FUCK WITH ME
[4:35:45] <%Toynota10> oh cool didn't know
[4:35:45] <RiverBirch> God damn
[4:35:47] <+kaniasaurus> ok thanks
[4:35:49] <ofloofy> V hardly ever gets hit just gotta manage familliar health
[4:35:59] <KingVantq> @RiverBirch Shadow and Griffon start dying really easy at 50
[4:36:00] <extradopeness> LOSER
[4:36:01] <joylent_blue> Toynota10 Break Age buster arm can take out like 3/4 of a DMD proto angelo's health
[4:36:03] <%deviljhojho94> bang bang bang
[4:36:04] <%Noahccountingfortaste> I got 300K rorbs for finishing @ChloeFleurage it's a good source if you ask me
[4:36:06] <JooseNeck> I only made it to 60 as V, meanwhile I got to 100 on my first try with Nero
[4:36:09] <%lewdskeletor13> What was different about DMC 3s Bloody Palace? I’m unfamiliar with it
[4:36:09] <%FrustratedAF> but does Bloody Palace exceed expectations?
[4:36:10] <alexandrecau> It takes like 45 floors befor the enemies can stalemate your summons
[4:36:11] <LegendaryDorkKnight> damn
[4:36:13] <artoflec> lol the head smack sound is really painful
[4:36:22] <Redbee2000> man those last 4 floors are nuts
[4:36:22] <%rytyoung> That was well timed
[4:36:23] <+atlasbot1> I got to level 50 as dante and died to 3 empusa queens
[4:36:23] <Dreamedlint> Shuffle is your friend
[4:36:24] <mr_ESB> Sup fury
[4:36:25] <%dukenux> Well i need to sleep, so enjoy your Bloody fuckplace
[4:36:25] <+TheoTTree> You can buster fury while it's in Ragtime bubble!
[4:36:26] <benjiFG> if only you had some sort of time stopper
[4:36:26] <KingVantq> fighting Furies with V was annoying
[4:36:27] <%waifoong98> @Noahccountingfortaste for finishing the whole thing?
[4:36:27] <triangularblasphemy> @FrustratedAF It 98% meets them
[4:36:28] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Guys, what's the point of Buster breaker when you have Devil Bringer again. Also why are the Bosses different genders in Shovel Knight.
[4:36:30] <+TheoTTree> too late :(
[4:36:33] <ofloofy> @KingVantq you can pull griffon and shadow back with your dodges so they ddont take hits
[4:36:34] <reinbachthe3rd> Fucking hate that enemy type. Always disappearing into the shadows.
[4:36:38] <TheBlankAce> There are so many moves i didn't see the goats do until bloody palace
[4:36:38] <%Noahccountingfortaste> @waifoong98 yeah, that was the total
[4:36:39] <joylent_blue> lewdskeletor13 it was randomized, and you could pick to take harder floors or easier floors, harder floors made you progress faster though
[4:36:41] <Idon__> @Sphincter_Spelunker Buster arm does WAY MORE DAMAGE
[4:36:41] <%Zamorouskiwhich> This room kicked my butt way more than I thought it would
[4:36:42] <triangularblasphemy> @Sphincter_Spelunker Does more damage
[4:36:45] <RiverBirch> YO
[4:36:46] <derekwst3> just wait in a few levels its the speed lizard and two spin lizards
[4:36:46] <SailingSaturn> ragtime on him, makes him trivial
[4:36:46] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> SARCASM
[4:36:47] <aimlesshealer> Ooooooh!!
[4:36:48] <%dorthafiq> ragtime would've solved your fury problem instantly
[4:36:48] <%deviljhojho94> oh shit
[4:36:49] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> BIG SARCAMS
[4:36:49] <Dr_Mooose> yooo

[4:36:55] <artoflec> holy shit
[4:36:55] <LegendaryDorkKnight> dbz fight
[4:36:55] <gordieda20> PogChamp
[4:37:00] <+TheoTTree> @Sphincter_Spelunker Kappa
[4:37:00] <triangularblasphemy> @Sphincter_Spelunker Sarcasm also does additional damage
[4:37:01] <alexandrecau> @Sphincter_Spelunker damage difference is like triple for breaker
[4:37:02] <+EU_is_Garbage> I lost at floor 70 with Nero and that floor is going to haunt my nightmares
[4:37:02] <%waifoong98> 300k huh, I could just run mission 13 twice for 150k each.
[4:37:06] <%Yokuho> I died in the room with the 3 furies
[4:37:09] <themechahobo> You used RagTime Breakage, and then didn't attack the Fury? Why?
[4:37:10] <triangularblasphemy> @Sphincter_Spelunker To my feelings T.T
[4:37:12] <bursky00> Fury is so cool
[4:37:12] <Covil91> Does helter skelter not clash?
[4:37:13] <%lewdskeletor13> @joylent_blue I see, thanks
[4:37:14] <Idon__> Fury or Blitz for most pain in the ass enemy?
[4:37:18] <derekwst3> you suck as much as i do
[4:37:20] <%deviljhojho94> CHOKING
[4:37:23] <+Dragon4234> @AngriestPat Yo use shuffle more often against these guys
[4:37:24] <%FrustratedAF> this dude a fuck
[4:37:28] <+Anthony_the_Author> I love Devil May Cry 5... but Fury is just a bad enemy
[4:37:31] <ScreamingMeat> 3 Furies is when the game tells you to fuck off
[4:37:32] <DracaenaLeaf> How can this be!?
[4:37:33] <+TheoTTree> Fury is fine
[4:37:33] <lloyddboy> isn't rawhide really good for him?
[4:37:34] <%spiritofmojave> @Covil91 Usually it does?
[4:37:35] <%Dr_DangerPhD> wtf that shuffle hit him though?
[4:37:35] <Rexenexus> Furies are truly the pleb filter
[4:37:35] <SailingSaturn> I had less trouble with Blitz LUL
[4:37:36] <devanmuse> can you buster counter that teleport in?
[4:37:37] <joylent_blue> Idon__ Furies are actually really predictable once you practice
[4:37:37] <+TheoTTree> Just gotta learn its rules
[4:37:38] <aimlesshealer> Use the force bruh
[4:37:39] <T_Sasquatch> LUL
[4:37:40] <Megapikman132> @AngriestPat They need to be prone or in the air. Then you can buster them for most of their health. I was labbing it the other night. Shuffle is super good for parrying most of their attacks, too.
[4:37:41] <%Niney_Who> some people parry this guy as V Pat you can do it Kappa
[4:37:43] <darkvergillll> Fury ain’t that bad
[4:37:45] <LiquidMathew> Shuffle so good
[4:37:45] <b_ikki> Yeah furies are a filter enemy for sure
[4:37:45] <ofloofy> Use rawhide against furries it helps
[4:37:47] <%lewdskeletor13> STUPID WEEB LIZARD
[4:37:49] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> Fury's are bastards
[4:37:49] <%dorthafiq> ragtime counters fury
[4:37:51] <reinbachthe3rd> Are you supposed to use the time warping arm on that enemy?
[4:37:52] <derekwst3> when he disappears jump and slash to the ground
[4:37:54] <%CerberusDriver> @AngriestPat Swing right as the red mist starts to disappear
[4:38:00] <%Noahccountingfortaste> @AngriestPat I jump to dodge and hit them with charge shot 3 to stun, then buster if you can
[4:38:02] <reinbachthe3rd> I always had problems with them.
[4:38:02] <themechahobo> Ragtime breakAge, then attack the Fury
[4:38:03] <joylent_blue> @AngriestPat gotta hit that lab for Furies :D
[4:38:03] <extradopeness> Rawhide is strong
[4:38:03] <TheBlankAce> Punchline helps with dot as well
[4:38:04] <%NopeBadguy> @AngriestPat hard way armors thought attacks, a lot of arms are really good at parrying or stuffing attacks, he'll always attack when the animation before is an unsheathe, otherwise, he'll move around
[4:38:05] <triangularblasphemy> Ragtime, rawhide, shuffle, short hop, play dante
[4:38:07] <AshmanFTW> I just spam gun on Fury
[4:38:08] <Dreamedlint> Snatch won't work on them until they're staggered.
[4:38:08] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> I don't know how to use shuffle proper NotLikeThis
[4:38:10] <+Bloodxb> furies are the git gud enemy
[4:38:11] <+TheoTTree> You can Ragtime them and buster them in the bubble @AngriestPat
[4:38:11] <%FrustratedAF> ragtime counters fury until you lose ragtime
[4:38:13] <%waifoong98> Shuffle is real good for parrying angelos
[4:38:15] <Idon__> I love how the grab animation for Buster is Nero having a little Dragonball fight before punching it in the face.
[4:38:17] <sukiyakiwestern> gerbera can also parry him super quickly
[4:38:21] <ofloofy> ^
[4:38:25] <joylent_blue> ^^
[4:38:28] <derekwst3> i hate fighting three of these
[4:38:30] <LegendaryDorkKnight> yup
[4:38:31] <joylent_blue> gerbera is godlike against furies

[4:38:53] <%deviljhojho94> hot as hell
[4:38:53] <triangularblasphemy> @Idon__ Nero also accuses it of deliberately wasting his time, which is REALLY applicable to Bloody Palace
[4:38:55] <Tampaoster> Super sexy sexy LUL
[4:38:56] <+reddpop_> Super Sassy Sexy?
[4:38:57] <reinbachthe3rd> Nero's DT is frickin' dope.
[4:38:57] <LegendaryDorkKnight> Nico is such a dork lol
[4:39:01] <LiquidMathew> @xsnipes same time coop bloody palace is out
[4:39:02] <%brickwall35> are the stages preset or random?
[4:39:04] <joylent_blue> no GP01 in BP pvpWhy
[4:39:07] <%waifoong98> oh look, it is level 15 or something in DMC4, shocking
[4:39:07] <Megapikman132> Preset
[4:39:10] <joylent_blue> preset
[4:39:11] <%Yokuho> They are Preset
[4:39:13] <%Noahccountingfortaste> @brickwall35 preset
[4:39:14] <%brickwall35> ty
[4:39:24] <RiverBirch> WAIT
[4:39:25] <%Yokuho> I can't think of a major bullshit that make them random
[4:39:25] <mayorrev> GOTTA LET IT OUT
[4:39:25] <ofloofy> showdown so good
[4:39:26] <Prism_Wing> Whenever these knights come up I have the urge to "backstab" them.
[4:39:28] <freedomboyz> nice
[4:39:28] <RiverBirch> You still get that?
[4:39:30] <%Toynota10> I dunno y people say this is disappointing. it still looks really fun!

[4:39:33] <darkvergillll> @liquidmathew ? Kappa
[4:39:38] <benjiFG> summon yamato
[4:39:39] <%FrustratedAF> that was pretty fuckin good
[4:39:40] <LiquidMathew> just a joke
[4:39:41] <b_ikki> pretty sure it does less damage out of dt tho
[4:39:41] <derekwst3> this is also a good place to farm your collect 100 arms achievement if you haven't got it yet
[4:39:44] <aimlesshealer> Dante needs a move called hoedown
[4:39:44] <%deviljhojho94> great upgrade
[4:39:48] <DracaenaLeaf> Am I hearing "super sexy sexy"?
[4:39:49] <ofloofy> SPIRIT YAMATO
[4:39:52] <dan_g_v> Samurai Shodown reveal of that amazing girl!
[4:39:54] <DSD24> I wish the music kept playing
[4:39:55] <ofloofy> Its neros stand
[4:39:59] <Idon__> Guys, you see that datamined unused V animation?
[4:40:02] <triangularblasphemy> Like, oh NO Bloody Palace is JUST fighting! Thats only the SECOND BEST PART OF THE GAME
[4:40:04] <KazMkII> Stage 29 coming up monkaS
[4:40:05] <%FrustratedAF> soul of the blood of yamato
[4:40:06] <DSD24> @DracaenaLeaf Yes this stylish announcer says that at SSS
[4:40:10] <%Hilleltaco> @DracaenaLeaf I think it's "super sassy sexy"
[4:40:11] <%Noahccountingfortaste> @Idon__ yeah, looked cool
[4:40:14] <Idon__> It's a shame they never gave V his "screen clear" move.
[4:40:15] <LegendaryDorkKnight> yay other combos
[4:40:15] <b_ikki> c r a p
[4:40:18] <AbysmalWulf> LUL
[4:40:18] <Admiral_PopnFresh> so what is GP01, I see that in chat and all it think of his Gundam
[4:40:19] <lloyddboy> CRAP
[4:40:21] <Zanzaken> @b_ikki it does on top of the fact that you lose out on doing the phantom hits and the dt summoned sword hits.
[4:40:22] <T_Sasquatch> @Tokanova people expected vergil, coop and it to be a bit harder earlier on
[4:40:26] <%Yokuho> The fact that you can suspend in this new bloody palace makes me forgive the lack of coop, such a simple thing makes it so much better
[4:40:29] <Saltmeisterr> wait bloody palace has a time limit?
[4:40:29] <%CerberusDriver> V has a screen clear, its called Royal Fork?
[4:40:39] <%Dr00_PhD> GP01 is a deluxe edition breaker
[4:40:40] <%waifoong98> so how hard is this comparing to 4 BP chat?
[4:40:42] <joylent_blue> AdmiralButtloaf its a different version of the Gerbera arm, it IS a gundam reference LUL
[4:40:43] <DSD24> @Admiral_PopnFresh Its a alternate Gerbera with the GPO1 colors
[4:40:45] <%Noahccountingfortaste> @Admiral_PopnFresh it's a gerbera with the added option of tricking straight down to get to the floor
[4:40:49] <darkvergillll> Did people really expect Vergil to be free? LUL
[4:40:50] <ScreamingMeat> I love how the Chaoses eat shit when you fuck up their spin dash
[4:41:00] <Nina96> 70 stages left
[4:41:00] <triangularblasphemy> Bloody Palace has a time limit. If you are fighting, you'll never hit it. Because you will most likely die first, like a badass
[4:41:01] <OkamiDude15> @Saltmeisterr the time limit increases the better you do and with every kill you get. they added this in 4
[4:41:02] <Zanzaken> @waifoong98 I found 4 to be far more difficult.
[4:41:02] <freedomboyz> EZ
[4:41:04] <ofloofy> @xsnipes with mods he is Kappa
[4:41:06] <Jontman42> Why is that a stage

[4:42:17] <+TheoTTree> DOUBLE JUDECCA
[4:42:18] <Zanzaken> @waifoong98 I ended up beating 5's first try with Nero and Dante. I think it's because it's a combo of the enemies aren't as annoying to deal with in some cases and SoS and DH floors of BP in 5 are much easier to deal with.
[4:42:20] <Covil91> Judeccas mess me up so bad as V
[4:42:25] <tungstenviper> J U D E C C A

[4:42:38] <Dreamedlint> Judecca are so annoying.
[4:42:38] <triangularblasphemy> I just pop Sin DT here
[4:42:39] <JooseNeck> Holding enemies in this game is really good compared to 4
[4:42:39] <+Bloodxb> the 3 tiers of hells
[4:42:41] <tungstenviper> this is where Pat dies
[4:42:41] <%chubbypencil> I have less problems with Fury than i do jedecca

[4:43:03] <artoflec> do judecca's have a buster animation because i can never get to them when they're stunned
[4:43:05] <bsmusic> I ate shit on floor 60 with Nero
[4:43:05] <Dr_Mooose> oof
[4:43:06] <Megapikman132> @AngriestPat Random tip, Hardway always pops Judicas off of the ground, leading to a free buster and often a breaker followup.
[4:43:07] <joylent_blue> punch line pvpWhy
[4:43:08] <dipstere> this is when i wished directional lockon was an option instead of being stuck with nearest enemy lock

[4:43:21] <LegendaryDorkKnight> this is gunna take like 2 hrs
[4:43:24] <b_ikki> @artoflec yeah just buster them when they flinch at all

[4:43:49] <ScreamingMeat> So Nero technically has a quadruple jump in this game, right? Jump, Air Hike, the wing arm thing, and the Air Taunt
[4:43:51] <FenixSeraph> Careful with that last arm
[4:43:51] <%Toynota10> this game's so cool

[4:44:36] <%dorthafiq> nice
[4:44:37] <alexandrecau> @Covil91 in son of sparda yes, his execution is great
[4:44:40] <aimlesshealer> I do not understand why Nero grew his arm back. I don't think he does, either
[4:44:44] <%Hilleltaco> @waifoong98 Breaking a Mephisto's cloak but it's over the edge so it just comes back NotLikeThis
[4:44:45] <Zanzaken> @joylent_blue 90 IS a boss
[4:44:46] <linkwolf4> it's almost weird to see nero with a regular ass arm
[4:44:47] <%FrustratedAF> delicious, delicious tomboy
[4:44:47] <LiquidMathew> Wonder what Dante and V get on these floors, just health and white orbs?
[4:44:48] <+Thunder_Poo> Pat looks like a tomato
[4:44:52] <Tampaoster> yeyeyey tomboy
[4:44:52] <%bluemorning104> cheer200 So, Pat, Bloody Palace is here but it's not co-op, there's no Vergil, and Divergence mode isn't in the game. What do you think are the chances that this barebones BP update was an April Fool's joke they've been planning for months, and that everything we've ever wanted will be stealth-dropped? I think the chances are low, but a stealth-drop is the one thing missing from the never-ending DMC hype train.
[4:44:53] <Idon__> Tomboy noooooo

[4:45:11] <aimlesshealer> @LegendaryDorkKnight It was the only part of the story where I was just like "What."
[4:45:13] <Covil91> @LiquidMathew I know V doesn't get the break floors at all. Dante too probably
[4:45:14] <%Noahccountingfortaste> @ScreamingMeat NEVER touch the floor, NEVER

[4:45:21] <OkamiDude15> @aimlesshealer you can do anything if your determined/angry enough
[4:45:21] <%Tucker0603> how dare you

[4:45:57] <%NopeBadguy> that empusa got some good hits in tho
[4:45:58] <%Docblargle> we've gone full circle. Tomboy is out, ragtim is in
[4:45:59] <%xemnahort> @dan_g_v you mean woke to I NEED MORE POWER
[4:46:02] <extradopeness> A family can be 8 tomboys
[4:46:02] <+Bloodxb> that one empusa was having none of it
[4:46:03] <derekwst3> i make sure you grab the green orbs dude
[4:46:03] <DavidCCK> Nero suffers from a severe lack of moves, at least that's how it feels to me
[4:46:05] <%waifoong98> @Zanzaken yeah it is slightly annoying to control
[4:46:08] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> If Power is stored in Vergil's balls, what is stored in Dante's balls? Pizza, strawberry sundaes?
[4:46:08] <%Dr00_PhD> Breaker does significantly more damage
[4:46:09] <LegendaryDorkKnight> I mean if nero is quarter demon how can he dt
[4:46:10] <triangularblasphemy> I already GOT A HAIRCUT!

[4:46:28] <Soman97> @angriestpat so you like ragtime now but not tomboy? Talk about a 180
[4:46:29] <derekwst3> this is when i summoned nightmare for the first time as v
[4:46:32] <b_ikki> yeyeye
[4:46:33] <Nina96> @WizardofAahz thier not for u to read
[4:46:35] <alexandrecau> hate scissors with adds, they get tiresome
[4:46:35] <b_ikki> keep doing that
[4:46:37] <Tampaoster> Time to big panic
[4:46:38] <b_ikki> ragtime is good for that
[4:46:38] <triangularblasphemy> parry their mask put on!
[4:46:39] <%CerberusDriver> but i thought ragtime sucked?
[4:46:40] <Idon__> I hope if Vergil gets a SIN DT, it isn't normal doppelganger, but the stand from DMC4.
[4:46:47] <triangularblasphemy> You can parry the maaaaaaasks!
[4:46:50] <ofloofy> Max-acts are like music to my ear
[4:46:51] <triangularblasphemy> It makes them AFRAID
[4:46:52] <LegendaryDorkKnight> Nero drank the ye ye juice
[4:46:57] <extradopeness> Ragtime makes u DIO
[4:47:00] <darkvergillll> @cerberusdriver WHAT?
[4:47:03] <%waifoong98> @Hilleltaco Faust is tough, yep, but you can do a full macabre danse or gilgamesh them to dead easily.
[4:47:05] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Big beefy arm like Woolie's leg
[4:47:05] <Zanzaken> Whomever at capcom thought it would be a cool idea to bring the nobody back in 5 should be fired and never allowed to work on a game again I swear.
[4:47:06] <b_ikki> doing that with ragtime you can get proto angelos in a grabb loop
[4:47:09] <%salty_syd913> yoooo
[4:47:11] <Idon__> jesus there's so much shit coming out of Nero's ass
[4:47:12] <ScreamingMeat> It's kinda weird how Sparda was a gross bug man but all of his decedents DTs are lizard people/Diablo
[4:47:14] <JanusII> I found out last night even V's cane can one shot the scissors even if they have health left. LUL
[4:47:16] <%Toynota10> Did you know turning on Tomboy is a parry too?
[4:47:27] <triangularblasphemy> Why the hate for the nobodies, they have so much freaking character!
[4:47:28] <joylent_blue> Nero's DT ass is THICC as fuck
[4:47:30] <Idon__> Nero gets SUMMON FISTS.
[4:47:31] <Nina96> i didnt need to see thier bodys
[4:47:33] <ofloofy> @ScreamingMeat Thats cus they didnt wake up to bug justice
[4:47:35] <bsmusic> You can buster them when you break the sword
[4:47:39] <triangularblasphemy> Giggly fetus nerds
[4:47:41] <extradopeness> I knew that shit
[4:47:43] <lloyddboy> +0:00:01

[4:47:48] <LegendaryDorkKnight> idk sparta just had bug wings
[4:47:51] <Soman97> @xsnipes Pat was shit talking rag time in the latest episode of the LP on Wookiee channel
[4:47:54] <%NopeBadguy> he hit you with that shuma gorath beam
[4:47:59] <%CerberusDriver> MY POWER
[4:48:01] <silvcrest> Did you know V's snap is a parry?
[4:48:08] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @ScreamingMeat Eva was a lizard person
[4:48:14] <Megapikman132> @AngriestPat Another random tip, you know how activating DT pops the enemies, giving you a free buster? Well, the Death Sissor buster is an instant kill, so if there's only one, and you have meter to burn...
[4:48:15] <LiquidMathew> Every Devil Breaker is great and a work of art and you're gonna love them
[4:48:16] <Admiral_PopnFresh> jeez, why was that empusa so strong?
[4:48:16] <Tampaoster> Do you get an arms refil when you reach 0 or is it at specific levels only?
[4:48:18] <extradopeness> 16 minutes p good
[4:48:22] <joylent_blue> silvcrest his snap when he summons nightmare????
[4:48:22] <silvcrest> When he activates DT
[4:48:23] <%Agami23> i dont completely get how knuckle works
[4:48:23] <joylent_blue> the fuck
[4:48:24] <Nina96> it is?
[4:48:24] <darkvergillll> Drilled
[4:48:24] <triangularblasphemy> But yeah, if you knock off both of the Nobody's masks with parries, their AI switches to coward mode
[4:48:27] <Malziel> that's SICK
[4:48:27] <joylent_blue> the FUCK
[4:48:27] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> yup
[4:48:28] <+TheoTTree> No fucking way
[4:48:28] <ofloofy> That snap is a game changer
[4:48:29] <Idon__> his snap is a parry? THAT'S FUCKING STYLISH
[4:48:30] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> V's DT is a DT explsoion

[4:55:59] <%NopeBadguy> @AngriestPat for fury hard way armors through attacks, a lot of arms are really good at parrying or stuffing attacks, he'll always attack when the animation before is an unsheathe, otherwise, he'll move around first; if you parry him, you should get like a couple attacks before he teles away, so buster right after you confirm; practice it in the void at some point, it's pretty easy once you know

[5:00:50] <%spiritofmojave> Set the theme to Vergil 2 and do this shit
[5:00:51] <Malziel> @joylent_blue More like Subewwman amirite?
[5:00:54] <T_Sasquatch> Work off that DEBT
[5:00:55] <%daisyyyy> subhuman is the worst of the three but i still like it
[5:00:58] <%waifoong98> such "memorable" song
[5:00:58] <b_ikki> @triangularblasphemy same as nico but for dante
[5:00:58] <aimlesshealer> Subhuman continues to suck
[5:01:01] <squirtkitten> @triangularblasphemy you have to buy the pack
[5:01:03] <Nina96> no more mpreg jokes because of dante...
[5:01:03] <joylent_blue> Prism_Wing A for "Adequate"
[5:01:04] <Zombrocom> Subhuman is alright
[5:01:04] <+Andrizzleton> Why does the song restart? NotLikeThis
[5:01:05] <+Bloodxb> even just set hat pull is worth bringing
[5:01:05] <LegendaryDorkKnight> miss it still
[5:01:06] <+DannyBucko231> At least this version of Subhuman is alright.
[5:01:07] <%daisyyyy> that riff is gorgeous
[5:01:09] <darkvergillll> U cannnnnnnot kill meeeeeeeee
[5:01:11] <derekwst3> yes i just used those for the first few rounds
[5:01:15] <%spiritofmojave> First 2 notes of Subhuman, thanks I hate it more
[5:01:15] <%FrustratedAF> @Prism_Wing nero's dad hates him Kappa
[5:01:20] <%Beerswithbears> i like subhuman tbh
[5:01:22] <%waifoong98> DMC2 music plz
[5:01:25] <ScreamingMeat> After you beat the game Rebellion and Sparda should have DS Dante's moveset minus the summon swords
[5:01:26] <Nina96> @Andrizzleton because the game hates us
[5:01:26] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Chorus "YOU CAN NOT KILL ME." makes Subhuman tolerable
[5:01:27] <derekwst3> rocket the bats
[5:01:29] <triangularblasphemy> @b_ikki @squirtkitten Thanks guys! I have the pack, I just thought it was Nico for EVERYONE. Who does V get?
[5:01:32] <Covil91> I need another hand for DSD summoned swords
[5:01:33] <bsmusic> DMC 2 Barf
[5:01:33] <%Hilleltaco> I catch myself trying to rev Dante's sword every now and then, and I think I tried to trickster away as V yesterday
[5:01:37] <ofloofy> @Beerswithbears Little vs subhuman is really good
[5:01:41] <joylent_blue> the guitar for Subhuman is cool, just don't get high style so the vocals don't kick in LUL
[5:01:42] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@typicalhunkz) (warning)
[5:01:42] <+theAncopro> oh i thought he says 'you wack off that pimp, son'
[5:01:45] <Nina96> DMC 2 had music?
[5:01:52] <extradopeness> Yeah this may surprise you Pat but this game features Dante from the Devil May Cry series
[5:01:52] <%waifoong98> @Nina96 yes and they are great
[5:01:53] <+bear_breaker20> Balrog Kreygasm
[5:01:54] <darkvergillll> Dmc2 was a thing?
[5:01:55] <T_Sasquatch> @Sphincter_Spelunker i love hearing that when im SSS and I havent taken a hit
[5:02:04] <%nitronLVIII> Dantes mom should have been one of the style announcers Kappa
[5:02:06] <linkwolf4> I honestly have had subhuman grow on me a bit
[5:02:06] <derekwst3> yeah i cheesed most levels with the twin bazookas
[5:02:06] <%Beerswithbears> @ofloofy Yea it is
[5:02:07] <%daisyyyy> @sphincter_spelunker that chorus is a lot of why i like the song, thats true lol
[5:02:08] <%spiritofmojave> Kalina Ann parry Kreygasm
[5:02:10] <b_ikki> @triangularblasphemy V gets Nico as well unfortunately
[5:02:14] <+spiegelspike> does he not like sustaining the beam for twin kalina anne?
[5:02:17] <+DannyBucko231> PogChamp
[5:02:18] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> heck yea
[5:02:19] <derekwst3> use the lazer on these guys
[5:02:19] <ScreamingMeat> @xsnipes We don't talk about DMC2
[5:02:20] <+Nthenorm> Kreygasm
[5:02:20] <+Virokwet> gdang
[5:02:22] <LegendaryDorkKnight> lol good job son
[5:02:23] <a_mad_dragon> goodbye shields
[5:02:26] <Prism_Wing> Just imagine getting a SSS as Nero and when the fight ends you just hear Vergil say "I'm proud of you"
[5:02:26] <+Arbal3st> Ignite the Flame?
[5:02:27] <triangularblasphemy> @b_ikki Ah well. Can't have everything
[5:02:29] <derekwst3> bazooka these
[5:02:31] <themechahobo> Pat: what's your plan to be DMD Vergil without Faust? Have you actually perfected RGing him?
[5:02:35] <DefaultSettiings> how did Ashs Charizard know tackle
[5:02:37] <darkvergillll> This is going by fast
[5:02:42] <LegendaryDorkKnight> that my boy
[5:02:43] <LiquidMathew> @xsnipes dmc2 is important because if it wasn't so bad we won't have gotten such a good apology in the form of dmc3
[5:02:46] <+awesomeguy423> @ScreamingMeat what DMC2? it just goes 1 then 9 right? Like Windows 8 to 10 and Mortal Kombat 3 to 9?
[5:02:50] <Zombrocom> Never even seen that attack
[5:02:53] <+awesomeguy423> 1 then 3*
[5:02:56] <benjiFG> i have bread
[5:03:08] <derekwst3> @xsnipes he could go faster without style
[5:03:10] <AlasterAngelo> choreographed hopping
[5:03:14] <joylent_blue> jump canceling Cav's SM air combo is godlike

[5:04:01] <ScreamingMeat> @awesomeguy423 Yup, DMC1 was so good they new DMC2 would be a disappointment so they didn't make a 2 and skipped to 3. That is exactly what happened

[5:04:46] <b_ikki> yeyeye that combo is tight
[5:04:50] <ShershaAD> i was just trying to get hyped
[5:05:05] <aimlesshealer> I don't remember the verdict on the old matchup, but would current Dante easily be able to defeat Bayonetta?
[5:05:06] <+marcus1913> what was that transformation???
[5:05:07] <+Arbal3st> featuring Kilik from Soul Calibur
[5:05:09] <%waifoong98> just balrog them, they can't do shit
[5:05:14] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @AngriestPat You know Dante's Sin DT has a showdown, yeah? Does spend the whole bar, but it's full screen.
[5:05:20] <joylent_blue> >grilled cheese isn't a meal
[5:05:21] <CrimsonGargoyle> wow pat didn't change dante's song?
[5:05:21] <ShershaAD> @aimlesshealer well he beat her originally

[5:05:23] <Megapikman132> Good ole stinger LUL
[5:05:24] <ShershaAD> so yes
[5:05:26] <%Agami23> why even have coyote-A when you could use JUST ebony, ivory, and calina annes
[5:05:27] <joylent_blue> only if you're a COWARD
[5:05:29] <Zombrocom> @Sphincter_Spelunker he knows about judgement
[5:05:32] <aimlesshealer> @ShershaAD Guess that answers that
[5:05:32] <ShershaAD> dante would anhialate bayo
[5:05:33] <ScreamingMeat> King Cerberus is so fucking cool and hot and electrifying
[5:05:36] <derekwst3> bayo i believe would beat him the first few times, but dante would just keep getting up

[5:06:05] <+bear_breaker20> feature? PogChamp
[5:06:07] <aimlesshealer> Dante is now hairless
[5:06:07] <lizard0tm> Bug
[5:06:08] <%Agami23> what just happened?
[5:06:08] <ofloofy> Perfect spinnn
[5:06:09] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @Zombrocom I just rarely see it on playthroughs. Also, thought as much
[5:06:12] <joylent_blue> themechahobo do you mean jump canceling in general or just specifically with Cav?
[5:06:14] <+theAncopro> ye ive had that too where they just spin forever
[5:06:18] <Saltmeisterr> AW RIGHT
[5:06:25] <+roronoapedro> It's the golden ratio, Pat.
[5:06:26] <Nina96> nice
[5:06:27] <triangularblasphemy> I just want it to very slowly float into the sky
[5:06:28] <Clyderso> Kreygasm
[5:06:31] <%waifoong98> Driving Cavalier can power through their Spin
[5:06:35] <+theAncopro> seems like only one they rev back is when you can stop them
[5:06:35] <AlasterAngelo> shove your fist up his butt and get him mpreg
[5:06:37] <triangularblasphemy> ascend ASCEND
[5:06:40] <aimlesshealer> @triangularblasphemy like an unbelievably shitty skateboard
[5:06:41] <themechahobo> With Cavaliere. Like what combo and how is it good?
[5:06:42] <linkwolf4> kick the shit out of those baby radobaan's pat
[5:06:44] <%spiritofmojave> I saw that shit farming rorbs with Faust on M13
[5:06:46] <%NopeBadguy> i think it's just weirdly particular about their spin state for some reason
[5:06:47] <+Andrizzleton> mpregdog?
[5:06:49] <%spiritofmojave> it's hilarious
[5:06:51] <triangularblasphemy> @aimlesshealer HECK yEAH
[5:06:56] <$Wafflum> I've never seen such a powerful Fred Durst monster before!
[5:07:08] <Nina96> NICE
[5:07:09] <%Niney_Who> YYYYEEEE
[5:07:09] <LegendaryDorkKnight> lol
[5:07:26] <joylent_blue> themechahobo the swordmaster midair combo with Cav can be jump canceled into itself after the first or second hits, leading to basically an infinite enemy juggle
[5:07:29] <triangularblasphemy> That lizard basically got anxiety
[5:07:47] <b_ikki> cav also dodes like a million damage
[5:08:00] <DefaultSettiings> the cheeks of justice must be spread for victory
[5:08:06] <themechahobo> @joylent_blue will practice that, thanks!
[5:08:08] <xxshadowxx416> will dmc5 have more dlc
[5:08:10] <joylent_blue> anything, even DMD proto angelos can be killed by just THAT combo
[5:08:13] <joylent_blue> takes a minute though
[5:08:17] <Zombrocom> I AM OMEGA
[5:08:22] <+Bloodxb> probably
[5:08:24] <joylent_blue> as long as it can be launched, of course
[5:08:26] <Nina96> @xxshadowxx416 most likely
[5:08:28] <b_ikki> DMD proto angelo defense monkaS
[5:08:31] <Covil91> I really dislike to Cerberus shouts
[5:08:37] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> What's y'alls gun button for Dante? I either find myself not using Coyote A for deafult or Ebony in gunslinger when I remap
[5:08:40] <joylent_blue> and doesn't teleport away, fucking Judeccas BabyRage
[5:08:43] <aimlesshealer> We love him
[5:08:44] <%spiritofmojave> Dan teased that it should have atleast one many of us are hoping for
[5:08:46] <+Kurogane_Dread> WAHOOO PIZZA
[5:08:52] <lizard0tm> You get penalized for super costumes right?
[5:08:54] <%spiritofmojave> Ladies Night would be nice tho
[5:08:56] <triangularblasphemy> @xxshadowxx416 It is not confirmed, but odds are good
[5:08:56] <Phoenon> I set gun to L1, might switch it to X though
[5:08:59] <darkvergillll> A crazy uncle
[5:09:01] <Malziel> PogChamp
[5:09:03] <+spiegelspike> BEEF ARM
[5:09:05] <Nina96> Dante is the only person born cool
[5:09:05] <triangularblasphemy> Ladies night PLEASE
[5:09:12] <%nitronLVIII> "1 good>2 awful>3 great>4 good>DmC awful>5 great" This means dmc 6 will be good dmc 7 will be a train wreck and dmc 8 will probably be the best game on Earth.
[5:09:15] <%shotgang86> its strange How much subhuman grew on me. That First impression from the original version finally went away
[5:09:15] <extradopeness> DisaPPOINTED
[5:09:17] <triangularblasphemy> Trish is actually one of my favorite playstyles
[5:09:22] <Zombrocom> I am too used to default to change anything
[5:09:23] <artoflec> disappointing elaYes
[5:09:26] <lizard0tm> I can't wait to play as Lady again
[5:09:26] <acp101123> was the voice announcer morrison?
[5:09:30] <triangularblasphemy> Spin and Beam, Spin while you Spin, Lightning forever
[5:09:30] <lizard0tm> And Lucia
[5:09:34] <%NopeBadguy> yo parrying them takes off the mask
[5:09:34] <LiquidMathew> I can't wait for DMC6 where Dante leaves Hell because he remembers that it doesn't have Pizza
[5:09:36] <%NopeBadguy> that's cool as shit
[5:09:36] <themechahobo> @joylent_blue Don't tell me it stun locks Furies?
[5:09:37] <+DannyBucko231> There'd better be a Ladies Night... 'Cuz the rent ain't free!
[5:09:41] <darkvergillll> I hope they rework lady’s playstyle if she’s dlc. She was so boring in dmc4se
[5:09:43] <lizard0tm> LUL
[5:09:47] <xxshadowxx416> good i want lucia in game
[5:09:54] <%waifoong98> just ice age Kappa
[5:10:00] <joylent_blue> themechahobo no unfortunately, furies and judeccas teleport out of it
[5:10:01] <LegendaryDorkKnight> I thought she was really fun
[5:10:03] <triangularblasphemy> Royal guard! The real estate costs NO MONEY
[5:10:03] <aimlesshealer> Cheese age Kappa
[5:10:08] <+bear_breaker20> that balrog use was near fetish material
[5:10:08] <42nfl19> Just cavalier it, it has armor so you can just tank the hit
[5:10:09] <%daisyyyy> so are Trish and Lady a thing? Or are they just an asexual polycule
[5:10:10] <LiquidMathew> @xsnipes she really just needs some more melee to be more fun to play
[5:10:10] <+spiegelspike> balrog jabs also work
[5:10:13] <%spiritofmojave> he has a good few variations of that 'pull out claw weeb move'
[5:10:15] <lizard0tm> Doesn't always do that Pat
[5:10:16] <Zombrocom> I saw someone do art of a DMC5 style lucia DT, looked amazing
[5:10:18] <Username_Needed> barlogggggggg
[5:10:23] <$Wafflum> Is Morrison the most underutilized character ever?
[5:10:27] <Dehlome> just shoot it in the face with your guns
[5:10:35] <lizard0tm> Just DMC2 it
[5:10:41] <lizard0tm> Shoot and win
[5:10:43] <bsmusic> Balrog is boring for fury
[5:10:43] <Capn_Bilge> one of the floors is just going to be like, 10 furys at once right?
[5:10:46] <%daisyyyy> morrison does get to say Dante stinks
[5:10:48] <darkvergillll> Lucia does need a second chance though
[5:10:49] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Lucia does actually nothing @Wafflum
[5:10:50] <b_ikki> those minutes are running away
[5:10:50] <joylent_blue> Capn_Bilge basically
[5:10:52] <xxshadowxx416> anime or 5 morrison
[5:10:56] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> which is a shame
[5:11:03] <Spiderfacev> WAHAA WAHOOO pizza
[5:11:04] <%spiritofmojave> Technically Lucia hasn't been utilized in 12-13ish years or so
[5:11:06] <triangularblasphemy> Lucia is like Kyrie, but also no voice actress
[5:11:08] <Edtango> How far did Pat get on the previous run?
[5:11:08] <%spiritofmojave> jermaPluto
[5:11:12] <SidBoyTM> Wait..
[5:11:15] <joylent_blue> you can do it pat
[5:11:16] <%Konquerer> apatCrazy apatCrazy apatCrazy
[5:11:18] <triangularblasphemy> She's in the game! You can't just see or hear lucia
[5:11:18] <joylent_blue> just trickster 4Head
[5:11:28] <%torontototoro> @Edtango 39
[5:11:29] <triangularblasphemy> She's right there! Near the statue! She's waving at us!
[5:11:30] <SidBoyTM> If Cavalier is a demon..does that mean it's also a smart bike?
[5:11:35] <Edtango> @torontototoro Thanks
[5:11:40] <%GeneralSCPatton> It sounds like Liu Kang with all these wacky sounds
[5:11:41] <%NopeBadguy> @triangularblasphemy well i mean...kyrie is important to nero, lucia isn't important to anyone FeelsBadMan
[5:11:43] <LiquidMathew> its kinda funny that in the anime there's literally a part where Rebellion seperates Demon from Human
[5:11:56] <themechahobo> Quick use Meteor- oh wait

[5:12:45] <Nina96> yes
[5:12:45] <%Niney_Who> And Nero grew his arm back
[5:12:48] <%Konquerer> because he's cooler
[5:12:48] <Username_Needed> also it drains waaaaay slower
[5:12:49] <joylent_blue> Nero is less demon after all
[5:12:49] <%NopeBadguy> it is.
[5:12:49] <b_ikki> because nero is a bitch
[5:12:50] <%Noahccountingfortaste> Dante has trigger heart, so it lasts longer
[5:12:50] <%spiritofmojave> does it?
[5:12:51] <Dehlome> hes got the 11 demon herbs and spices
[5:12:54] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Nero has Sweet Surrender Kappa

[5:13:01] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 5h 13m.
[5:13:02] <Zombrocom> Nero also has trigger heart,, right?
[5:13:02] <benjiFG> perish
[5:13:03] <%Niney_Who> Oh yeah true Nero should get a Trigger Heart

[5:13:48] <Kerozero> Uh, none of them are
[5:13:49] <b_ikki> yeah it's like dance macabre/million stabs
[5:13:49] <%Hilleltaco> Same as million stab and dance macabre
[5:13:50] <linkwolf4> huh. guess nero just isn't used to DT
[5:13:54] <Megapikman132> that's just always how judgement works
[5:13:54] <Djinnazz> yup,that move always has to finish.
[5:13:55] <OkamiDude15> he cant die because he is omega
[5:13:57] <aimlesshealer> Vergil needs a black fedora weapon to complement Faust
[5:13:58] <benjiFG> dance macabre also does that
[5:14:06] <Phoenon> IGNITE THE FLAME
[5:14:06] <optosi> a few moves only kill with the finisher
[5:14:08] <lizard0tm> Pat pls, change the music
[5:14:11] <joylent_blue> Nero's not used to DT without the help of daddy's yamato
[5:14:15] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @aimlesshealer It's a trilby, gosh
[5:14:17] <triangularblasphemy> I love you, Venom boxing gloves
[5:14:19] <lizard0tm> We're tired of Subhuman
[5:14:23] <+Bloodxb> its so it generates more style
[5:14:29] <triangularblasphemy> I WILL ignite the flame, thank you!
[5:14:30] <LegendaryDorkKnight> vergil also needs a sniper rifle to really sell it LUL
[5:14:32] <AshmanFTW> Vergil needs that crystal as a weapon style

[5:15:02] <bsmusic> BabyRage PLAY IT THE WAY I WANT
[5:15:03] <%Hilleltaco> I haven't tried it in this game, but I remember in 4 you could jump cancel million stab to leave them at 1 HP, and then kill them with the rose throw
[5:15:05] <+Huderga> y'all are some babies subhuman isn't bad
[5:15:08] <LiquidMathew> Subhuman the song of MPREG

[5:15:17] <+LeroyOctopus> nuber 1 subhuman superfan, pat
[5:15:17] <themechahobo> Pat love Subhuman confirmed.
[5:15:18] <aimlesshealer> Fedora (or trillby w/e) with the cane, there you go
[5:15:21] <Ion_Laser> @connos_livereview wasn't that guy replaced from the song when Capcom found out?
[5:15:21] <HefestoForges> You cannot change me - I AM A COWARD
[5:15:22] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> do you need the collector's edition to change Dante's theme?
[5:15:24] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Cmon Kapcom, let me switch it to Devils Never Cry
[5:15:25] <triangularblasphemy> Subhuman isn't bad honestly... But Devils Never Cry beats it EASY
[5:15:27] <OkamiDude15> @Nina96 i feel like they've been equals since dante got his DT after the first fight in dmc3
[5:15:27] <Phoenon> Oh my god I feel like playing DMC5 now but I also wanna watch stream
[5:15:33] <lizard0tm> Subhuman, the theme of Pat
[5:15:39] <Username_Needed> god cavalliere is the absolute coolest
[5:15:40] <joylent_blue> Damashi_The_Kaotic i think you can buy music packs individually?
[5:15:41] <Nina96> @OkamiDude15 i can see that
[5:15:45] <%connos_livereview> @Ion_Laser its still his song
[5:15:47] <%spiritofmojave> I don't dislike it, but it's not really DMC-material
[5:15:49] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> thx
[5:15:51] <%meraud> meraud subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 7 months! 
[5:15:53] <Clyderso> Donte is like Dante's V 🤔
[5:15:56] <InfiniteSwagbito> Subhuman grew on me. I like it now. At least this verison of Subhuman, the original is trash
[5:15:56] <Ner234> Do the other themes have dynamic music?
[5:15:56] <Caidezes> The new mix of Subhuman is fine.
[5:16:02] <InfiniteSwagbito> @Ner234 No
[5:16:03] <joylent_blue> Ner234 no
[5:16:05] <PatchySouls> @triangularblasphemy It's a shame it isn't dynamic. I would love to hear the chanting begin when you get a S rank.
[5:16:11] <OkamiDude15> @Ner234 the dlc ones? naw
[5:16:18] <Ner234> Oh that's too bad. Oh well
[5:16:20] <LegendaryDorkKnight> *Bruce lee intensifies*
[5:16:26] <%connos_livereview> no mixes of subhuman are fine
[5:16:27] <+roronoapedro> I'd kill for a Taste The Blood dynamic, yeah
[5:16:33] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Dante gotta work off debt. I've seen this doujin monkaS
[5:16:34] <lizard0tm> I MUST EXPLODE
[5:16:35] <Reiveth> Crimson Cloud > Subhuman > Devil Trigger
[5:16:38] <Phoenon> New Subhuman is fine, way less screamy overpowering the actual instruments
[5:16:41] <joylent_blue> Taste the Blood Kreygasm
[5:16:44] <%spiritofmojave> @roronoapedro I'd love that Kreygasm
[5:16:49] <DSD24> @Sphincter_Spelunker Its so common its the worst
[5:16:52] <%NopeBadguy> GET EM GIRL
[5:16:56] <triangularblasphemy> @PatchySouls Exactly. B-A should be choir, S onwards should be choir and demon voice
[5:16:57] <%torontototoro> @AngriestPat still playing apex lately?
[5:16:59] <OkamiDude15> i wish we got those new mixes of the dmc1 boss themes as regular tracks to use
[5:17:00] <benjiFG> use the hakai move on the fury
[5:17:00] <aimlesshealer> God DMC3's music was on another level. So many great tracks
[5:17:06] <Spiderfacev> new subhumans fine, its got less creepy sex pervert.
[5:17:11] <+bear_breaker20> those damn baphoments and thier bufus!
[5:17:12] <%connos_livereview> if youre into mediocrity
[5:17:13] <+Virokwet> LOL
[5:17:14] <Phoenon> COME GIT ME
[5:17:15] <joylent_blue> DMC3 has one of my favorite OSTs ever
[5:17:16] <+roronoapedro> The remixes from History of DMC are a terrible teaser, it makes you think they made new arrengements.
[5:17:17] <ofloofy> I couldnt honestly tell the difference between the new and old subhuman LUL
[5:17:17] <Username_Needed> LUL
[5:17:18] <+dohrge> LUL
[5:17:19] <%SlugNut> I love how Balrog's jumping damage so easily knocks fury out if it's telporting BS
[5:17:23] <InfiniteSwagbito> That's the thing about Subhuman when it first came out. Vocals were trash, mixing was bad, but that instrumental was fucking godlike
[5:17:23] <+Arbal3st> he come got it
[5:17:25] <Phoenon> Balrog why are you so fucking cool
[5:17:27] <themechahobo> The fact that CyoA only does 150 on a charge attack is baffling to me.
[5:17:29] <+roronoapedro> They're even heavier than the originals! It fits with the Subhuman shit aesthetic.
[5:17:34] <AlasterAngelo> JUST MASH IT OUT
[5:17:37] <+Bloodxb> you can also just royal revenge furies
[5:17:37] <Ner234> As annoying Furies can be, they are easily one of the coolest enemies ever.
[5:17:38] <%waifoong98> LUL
[5:17:42] <joylent_blue> Balrog is unreliable
[5:17:43] <AshmanFTW> Can you welter counter Fury?
[5:17:44] <%waifoong98> Cheese age man Kappa
[5:17:47] <Megapikman132> Ice Age is the only true solution
[5:17:47] <joylent_blue> USE ROYAL REVENGE YEAH
[5:17:49] <triangularblasphemy> @aimlesshealer Tetsuya Shibata my man! He was the old composer back in the day
[5:17:50] <aimlesshealer> @roronoapedro That, and it was disappointing that King Cerberus' theme wasn't a remix of Suffer
[5:17:51] <%daisyyyy> Ima sucker for that 'got no respect for the demons in my head' line. Its my kinda dumb
[5:17:53] <Megapikman132> besides being good. Kappa
[5:17:55] <+Prinny_Raider> @AngriestPat Cerberus Ice Age is great for fury
[5:17:59] <ofloofy> Royal revenge lame it out yeaaahhh
[5:18:00] <bsmusic> Revolver is way funner imo
[5:18:00] <ofloofy> !!
[5:18:01] <Zombrocom> Ice Age though
[5:18:01] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @InfiniteSwagbito Dante's trailer had three good moments that had a break for the instrumental
[5:18:07] <%Konquerer> apatWrong
[5:18:09] <b_ikki> ice age is 100%
[5:18:10] <HefestoForges> LUL ate it all
[5:18:11] <+roronoapedro> @aimlesshealer Especially since the intro music for King *is* a remix of Suffer.
[5:18:12] <Zombrocom> Ice Age and Royal Revenge
[5:18:12] <%spiritofmojave> Maybe you're just unreliable with Balrog
[5:18:13] <+spiegelspike> only when fury crouches
[5:18:14] <AlasterAngelo> Yeah Ice Age or just parry them
[5:18:14] <Kerozero> Queens are the bane of my life in DMD
[5:18:17] <Phoenon> REV IT UP
[5:18:20] <DSD24> Catch this!
[5:18:24] <lizard0tm> Some reason you can't use Cavaliere R, what's up with that?
[5:18:27] <LegendaryDorkKnight> jabs all day son
[5:18:27] <lizard0tm> in BP
[5:18:27] <joylent_blue> ice age is good if the Fury's teleporting doesn't mess with your directional inputs BabyRage
[5:18:28] <Nina96> for real?
[5:18:31] <Username_Needed> real impact might be my favourite move ever tbh
[5:18:33] <ofloofy> Cavaleir is so god damn fun LUL ty capcom
[5:18:44] <b_ikki> yeah no cavaliere R FeelsBadMan
[5:18:47] <%spiritofmojave> @lizard0tm Yeah it's weird, I don't see how the slightly faster speed would ban it
[5:18:48] <Phoenon> I never really see anyone use the Lightning Revolver with Cerberus, looks so rad too
[5:18:50] <KingVantq> @lizard0tm cant use any deluxe edition items
[5:19:02] <lizard0tm> I see
[5:19:07] <InfiniteSwagbito> @AngriestPat Mission 70 is 3 SoS Fury's. Have Fuuuuuun
[5:19:14] <Phoenon> STYLE, Y'ALL
[5:19:14] <ofloofy> ^ LUL
[5:19:20] <aimlesshealer> Mmmm, lightning Kreygasm
[5:19:21] <+roronoapedro> Do any of these missions have the DMD new boss shit?
[5:19:26] <joylent_blue> InfiniteSwagbito DON'T SPOIL IT BabyRage
[5:19:27] <+awesomeguy423> okay
[5:19:30] <+AngriestAngryArtist> dante should have finishers as well. Can't have nero have all the grapplers
[5:19:30] <AlasterAngelo> I don't know if Pat's gonna get to floor 70
[5:19:35] <lizard0tm> Is it slightly faster? I never noticed a difference between Cavaliere vanilla and R
[5:19:40] <b_ikki> mission 80+ have DMD enemies and bosses
[5:19:40] <InfiniteSwagbito> @joylent_blue He's gonna diiiiiiieeeeeee
[5:19:40] <lizard0tm> other than color
[5:19:46] <Nina96> how far he get with Nero again?
[5:19:50] <OkamiDude15> doesnt cavaliere r get an extra move?
[5:19:51] <joylent_blue> 39?
[5:19:52] <acp101123> 39
[5:19:52] <Phoenon> The mission in DMC4 Bloody Palace I remember most vividly is the one near the end with a shitload of Angelos
[5:19:52] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Does Cavaliere Angelo have it's boss theme in Bloody Palace?
[5:19:55] <Ion_Laser> @Nina96 39
[5:19:56] <b_ikki> Cavaliere R has an extra move
[5:19:56] <benjiFG> furies seem to do the DmC thing where they don't attack when you battle other enemies
[5:19:57] <Kerozero> Honestly I wish I could select just Morrisons Style announcements over Nico
[5:19:57] <LiquidMathew> Cavaliere R has a slight different iirc
[5:19:58] <+awesomeguy423> best way to beat Furies with Nero: Ragtime best way to beat Furies with Dante: Royal Guard best way to beat Furies with V: lmao fuck if I know
[5:19:58] <%spiritofmojave> It's unarmored compared to regular Cavaliere so it moves a little faster yeah
[5:19:59] <InfiniteSwagbito> I won't spoil the final few missions though.
[5:20:08] <+awesomeguy423> @Sphincter_Spelunker yes
[5:20:12] <%waifoong98> back forward iceage
[5:20:13] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> naisu
[5:20:14] <Caidezes> I always use Cavaliere on the Angelos. Makes them melt in seconds.
[5:20:15] <Megapikman132> Yee
[5:20:16] <InfiniteSwagbito> @awesomeguy423 I just summoned Nightmare and cleaned up
[5:20:18] <Phoenon> FREEZE, IT'S COOL
[5:20:24] <+awesomeguy423> @InfiniteSwagbito well there's your answer
[5:20:27] <joylent_blue> Phoenon i remember getting to that a legit thinking "did my game glitch are these are just spawning forever omg" LUL
[5:20:29] <acp101123> that ice dome is very good to counter fury
[5:20:34] <joylent_blue> and*
[5:20:40] <%waifoong98> balrog is better against these
[5:20:43] <Shade075> I'm disappointed at the lack of DBZ teleport fights you can have with Fury while using trickster
[5:20:45] <+awesomeguy423> yo ngl I want to fuck Artemis
[5:20:46] <ofloofy> Cerberus just makes you a ninja turtle you already like pizza
[5:20:48] <aimlesshealer> Betch
[5:20:54] <InfiniteSwagbito> I prefer using Royalguard on these dudes
[5:20:55] <RetributionP> I forget at this point was the old subhuman a bad song?
[5:20:59] <LegendaryDorkKnight> @ofloofy LUL LUL
[5:21:00] <lizard0tm> LUL
[5:21:04] <+awesomeguy423> @RetributionP very
[5:21:04] <+AngriestAngryArtist> SHIPPU JINRAI!
[5:21:05] <darkvergillll> them kicks
[5:21:08] <InfiniteSwagbito> @RetributionP The lead singer was painful to hear
[5:21:12] <Nina96> @RetributionP yes
[5:21:13] <+awesomeguy423> it was really high pitched screaming
[5:21:13] <%spiritofmojave> That's absolutely correct LUL @ofloofy
[5:21:13] <xxshadowxx416> dmc6 need dmc 2 costunes
[5:21:14] <Zombrocom> Old subhuman was pretty bad yeah
[5:21:18] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @RetributionP bad mixing with the lyrics
[5:21:23] <ofloofy> LUL
[5:21:27] <RetributionP> right thanks
[5:21:29] <+awesomeguy423> fortunately the old lead singer got metoo'd so they had an excuse to replace him LUL
[5:21:29] <darkvergillll> FUK THESE GUYS
[5:21:30] <%waifoong98> Cavalier tho rollies man
[5:21:34] <a_mad_dragon> RAWHIDE
[5:21:35] <Username_Needed> he didn't bring in dr faust? NotLikeThis
[5:21:35] <aimlesshealer> Hmm, Dante is an Italian name...
[5:21:36] <%waifoong98> just drive into them
[5:21:36] <joylent_blue> pat you CAN'T melee them when they're turning
[5:21:43] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Nero doesn't have royal guard
[5:21:46] <themechahobo> Remember Pat: Attacking an enemies while you have Full DT is equivalent to wasting DT.
[5:21:51] <DSD24> Still think Subhuman is a terrible name for theme for Dante
[5:21:53] <%Agami23> you need to shoot them to keep them still
[5:21:56] <AlasterAngelo> Just Honeycomb Fire them when they're spinning they'll eat shit
[5:22:01] <InfiniteSwagbito> @AngriestPat If they stumble a moment after you shoot them while spinning, sword attacks will knock them out of the roll
[5:22:03] <zeif00> did you choose the dummy thicc life or did the dummy thicc life choose you Patrick?
[5:22:07] <Kerozero> Rainstorm does wonders
[5:22:09] <%waifoong98> @AlasterAngelo Pat using gunslinger LUL
[5:22:10] <joylent_blue> just honeycomb fire shit in general
[5:22:13] <+awesomeguy423> Crimson Cloud is a dumb name too, what is this fucking Dead Money
[5:22:13] <+roronoapedro> Pat, when you're DT, you might as well switch to Gunslinger so you get summon swords.
[5:22:20] <Straxx__> @RetributionP I kinda liked the "I must Explode" screaming part only
[5:22:22] <Ravendusk> I just charge them with Cavaliere to counter them lol
[5:22:26] <joylent_blue> Gunslinger is realllllly good in this game
[5:22:28] <LiquidMathew> Gunslinger is peak "wahoo pizza" Dante
[5:22:35] <ShinBazelgeuse> If you use ebony and ivory while they spin you can walkaround them. Not with coyote
[5:22:36] <ofloofy> all the styles are really good really

[5:24:00] <Agalladorn> easily best dante dt design
[5:24:03] <RetributionP> Yea i just couldent remember if everyone hated it because of the controversy because I was thinking of a separate art from artist argument.
[5:24:05] <Force_Zer0> I hate those Judecca fuckers
[5:24:10] <Shraquet> Sin Devil Trigger?
[5:24:11] <InfiniteSwagbito> Eating hits like a buffet
[5:24:11] <RetributionP> that I had before
[5:24:13] <dashwalrus> best dt design is 3 by far
[5:24:18] <Shraquet> Maybe now.
[5:24:18] <dashwalrus> it changes with every weapon
[5:24:20] <Shraquet> Not.
[5:24:25] <AlasterAngelo> i hate the dt bug designs
[5:24:28] <AlasterAngelo> from 3
[5:24:29] <LiquidMathew> That Judecca to get Vergil's EX colors on SoS was the real final boss
[5:24:29] <Kerozero> To be honest I kinda wish Rebellion and Sparda had Drive too
[5:24:39] <Phoenon> I liked Dreadnaught's design, just sucks you never really used it at all
[5:24:41] <aimlesshealer> Handsome
[5:24:44] <joylent_blue> really cool thing about DT Gunslinger formation swords, Vergil has unique dialogue when you use it against him

[5:25:05] <InfiniteSwagbito> @joylent_blue "Can't always have it your way."
[5:25:06] <lizard0tm> DT on Dante in 5 does slightly change with certain weapons like Balrog and the hat
[5:25:11] <AshmanFTW> I'm Really tempted to get this on PC, the loading times on ps4 are rough

[5:27:11] <MrPedrovsky> @themechahobo i would but I don’t have any sort of computer at all
[5:27:13] <DSD24> @Phoenon I love that picture so much
[5:27:18] <Phoenon> It's pretty amusing how Dante actually puts on his biker goggles when he DT's with Cavaliere equipped
[5:27:18] <ofloofy> @Phoenon real talk LUL
[5:27:19] <Caidezes> I still can't believe the Nobodies came back.

[5:28:27] <+misterfistor> whats the furthest pats made it so far
[5:28:31] <joylent_blue> DrPoxx it doesn't really get hard imo until the last 10 floors or so
[5:28:42] <ofloofy> i hate this stage
[5:28:43] <aimlesshealer> Can you imagine how terrifying it would be for Dante to chase after you with his damn motorcycle
[5:28:43] <+Bloodxb> just armor through the fire
[5:28:44] <ofloofy> LUL
[5:28:46] <AlasterAngelo> The Artemis fight with Dante is kind of frustrating. Make sure not to Air Trick to the Grim Grips

[5:30:01] <lizard0tm> I think it'd be neat if Dante's head changed to be like a motorcycle helmet in DT to match the goggles
[5:30:09] <InfiniteSwagbito> Yes dante, poledance for my amusement
[5:30:22] <LiquidMathew> He puts the goggles on when he DTs though
[5:30:22] <+spiegelspike> I always get a kick out of the healing flies getting devil trigger on dmd

[5:31:13] <Phoenon> Have you tried The Luce in Sin DT yet? It's probably the most busted move I've seen in DMC yet @AngriestPat
[5:31:16] <InfiniteSwagbito> usually just save the Judgement Cut for riiiiiight before you run out of meter
[5:31:20] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> nice
[5:31:23] <Shraquet> 9-+*The Luce?
[5:31:25] <joylent_blue> torontototoro theres probably one i'm not familiar with but i'd say dmc3
[5:31:25] <ofloofy> Luce = nothing lives
[5:31:28] <Zombrocom> The Luce is pure DPS
[5:31:34] <b_ikki> luce is so lame tho
[5:31:35] <%spiritofmojave> The Luce is probably as good as the screen wipe with X+Y
[5:31:38] <AlasterAngelo> EEYYYAA
[5:31:38] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> but what if he needs it later LUL
[5:31:40] <benjiFG> is luce the meteor or the lasers

[5:31:45] <Zombrocom> Lasers
[5:31:46] <b_ikki> lasers
[5:31:47] <Djinnazz> lasers
[5:31:53] <benjiFG> luce FUCKS
[5:32:03] <lizard0tm> The wording of Quad S confuses me, is it that you can go into Sin DT afer getting SSS or what?
[5:32:06] <%spiritofmojave> You mean bitchsta?
[5:32:08] <Zombrocom> Spam Luce until about to end, then drop judgement for max dps
[5:32:10] <+imporia_> the faust meteor should be an SDT move
[5:32:10] <aimlesshealer> Me too Pat. Me too.
[5:32:14] <darkvergillll> same
[5:32:17] <AlasterAngelo> is Luce the one that makes them explode?
[5:32:22] <+Maids4lyfe> I thought you were good at style switching
[5:32:22] <LegendaryDorkKnight> pat hasn't learned to style fly yet
[5:32:23] <joylent_blue> this game really taught me how to style switch
[5:32:26] <buffmurffy> font even touch the stick, just use trickster to move around
[5:32:27] <joylent_blue> i SUCKED at it in 4
[5:32:27] <%waifoong98> I got gud with Keyboard LUL
[5:32:33] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @lizard0tm Press button at triple S, get SIn DT for a few seconds
[5:32:40] <InfiniteSwagbito> mmmmmm dat real impact
[5:32:41] <ofloofy> @lizard0tm when you hit tripple s you can activate sin dt and cancel it for quick attacks
[5:32:42] <SirBrawler18> Pat do you have any tips on V or Nero vs Furies?
[5:32:45] <Zombrocom> @lizard0tm It lets you use Sin DT for free for about 3 seconds as long as you cancel it in time
[5:32:47] <lizard0tm> I try to style switch and end up on Gunslinger when I wanted royal guard and die LUL
[5:32:48] <benjiFG> what was cool?

[5:33:04] <xxshadowxx416> it 4 and 5 that it have it
[5:33:04] <extradopeness> Build up DT and health mainly what these rooms are for
[5:33:11] <+RushUnplugged> @lizard0tm pretty much you can go into SDT for free if you're at SSS, and as long as you keep it it's still free (for a few seconds)
[5:33:22] <+imporia_> no bulli D:
[5:33:23] <lizard0tm> thnx
[5:33:25] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @SirBrawler18 Snatch, color up

[5:33:32] <lizard0tm> yeah DMC2 strats
[5:33:32] <%waifoong98> @Quigsies it is pretty easy tbh, you don't have to hurt your finger that much and the left pinkie is always on the lock on button

[5:34:31] <Covil91> SDT Luce would melt this bitch I bet
[5:34:35] <themechahobo> Legit question chat: Would you consider using Steams Controller setup to make Trickster always a button press away, to be cheating?
[5:34:36] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Normal DT Dante ResidentSleeper
[5:34:44] <%waifoong98> @Quigsies yeah, the only thing you have to get use to and the constant use of camera reset
[5:34:45] <ofloofy> artemis has like no hp man
[5:34:45] <+logoth_> She has Aerods
[5:34:45] <joylent_blue> SirBrawler18 with Nero, Gerbera is a godsend, you just gotta practice the timing a little and know when they're feinting (not showing their red claw before teleporting) and you're gold
[5:34:54] <b_ikki> @themechahobo yeah but who cares it's a single player game
[5:34:54] <lizard0tm> Cavaliere + Trickster Kreygasm
[5:34:57] <AlasterAngelo> why doesn't dante turn her into a devil arm again

[5:49:20] <Zombrocom> @Sahakitt Highest DPS anyway, Distortion for a single hit I think
[5:49:30] <%deviljhojho94> @InfiniteSwagbito @mechslayer71 thank you fellow crackheads
[5:49:31] <darkvergillll> orrrrrrbs
[5:49:32] <+Eiiriika> sigh floor 87 as nero, got taken out by fury with DT on it
[5:49:33] <Force_Zer0> That bug with Havel The Rock poise
[5:49:37] <InfiniteSwagbito> Distortion is "Fuck this enemy in particular"
[5:49:41] <+tygermom> floor 90 boss with V is dumb
[5:49:48] <Phoenon> He's gained like 300k orbs so far from this run alone
[5:49:57] <b_ikki> yeah distortion is a kill button
[5:50:02] <acp101123> 3 million orbs is the reward for finishing it
[5:50:06] <joylent_blue> i've heard conflicting reports on this, does DRI actually exist in 5?
[5:50:07] <SpaceGuntank> Pat combo video when?
[5:50:08] <themechahobo> @tygermom thats still impressive though. Whats the hardest part of V's BP?
[5:50:13] <Phoenon> Distorted Real Impact LUL
[5:50:14] <Zombrocom> I just wish you had enough time in SSSS to do distortion
[5:50:16] <+tygermom> furries
[5:50:23] <b_ikki> no DMC4 distortion does not exist
[5:50:24] <T_Sasquatch> @Phoenon you can get that in one mission using faust for mission 13 LUL
[5:50:24] <+misterfistor> Ah I see Pat has taken the BIG PARANOIA route and took off Faust
[5:50:24] <+tygermom> furries with V is annoying as hell
[5:50:25] <SirBrawler18> Yep I guess heres a new rorb grind place
[5:50:26] <%torontototoro> how many BP attempts have their been on stream so far?
[5:50:27] <Admiral_PopnFresh> that was wierd
[5:50:30] <Megapikman132> giving you a break
[5:50:32] <acp101123> 2
[5:50:33] <+roronoapedro> Pat begins to notice that his life is a fabrication
[5:50:33] <%torontototoro> there*
[5:50:36] <%waifoong98> He would have like, get 500k + if he used Faust LUL
[5:50:37] <+tygermom> also no you only get 1 mil from completing BP
[5:50:39] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> 2
[5:50:39] <joylent_blue> torontototoro just 2, this one and one with nero
[5:50:42] <%DedlokPM> @b_ikki The Luce is literally an Itano Circus. There is no way it can be lame
[5:50:49] <acp101123> I thought it was 3 huh
[5:50:49] <lizard0tm> @AngriestPat Some floors are just to regain health
[5:50:49] <T_Sasquatch> you shouldnt be using bloody palace to farm rorbs when faust exists LUL
[5:50:51] <%torontototoro> @joylent_blue ty
[5:50:57] <zeroraider> Time 4 THICCster
[5:50:59] <Zanzaken> Actually the Fury is really easy with V. Many of his attacks are so active and meat on this summons that they are SUPER trivial.
[5:51:01] <KingVantq> too bad by the time they released BP most people have everything bought
[5:51:05] <joylent_blue> Sin Scissors HATE cav
[5:51:05] <+Andrizzleton> just a quick victory lap to recover dt
[5:51:07] <Zanzaken> *meaty
[5:51:08] <joylent_blue> they HATE IT
[5:51:09] <themechahobo> @Twitch Primetygermom figured, was hoping he had a trick to deal with them.
[5:51:21] <+tygermom> i just kept trying to parry them with the cane
[5:51:26] <+tygermom> got it a couple times
[5:51:31] <+tygermom> but the timing is weird imo
[5:51:35] <+tygermom> gotta get used to it
[5:51:36] <InfiniteSwagbito> @tygermom Same, satisfying as hell
[5:51:39] <benjiFG> nice
[5:51:44] <%deviljhojho94> I honestly like new subhuman unironically
[5:51:48] <%deviljhojho94> has a goofy charm to it
[5:51:50] <extradopeness> PogChamp
[5:51:50] <Idon__> IT'S A TRAP
[5:51:52] <b_ikki> surprise
[5:51:52] <Admiral_PopnFresh> ....how did he parry not in RG?
[5:51:52] <+tygermom> subhuman is hype
[5:51:52] <invisi_bliss> pranked
[5:51:55] <bsmusic> O O F
[5:51:55] <joylent_blue> yeah get fucked
[5:51:55] <thecrispyones> PogChamp
[5:51:55] <Zombrocom> Make em kill each other
[5:51:58] <%DedlokPM> I've the insta kill appear a few times using shadow.
[5:51:58] <darkvergillll> 3 BIG BOIS
[5:52:00] <%deviljhojho94> the chorus is really nice
[5:52:00] <%connos_livereview> PogChamp
[5:52:03] <InfiniteSwagbito> @Zanzaken Yeah it's not too hard. Can't imagine how fucked it is for Nero tho
[5:52:04] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> coxFeedMe coxFeedMe coxFeedMe
[5:52:09] <+SolverCODO> cranked
[5:52:09] <AlasterAngelo> thought it'd be a tentacle floor eh
[5:52:09] <Nyemmers> oh man what a clusterfuck of enemies
[5:52:09] <Kerozero> Yeah uh welcome to hell
[5:52:12] <+theAncopro> thissss looks like an SDT room
[5:52:15] <Monkeyweed21> humungus chungus
[5:52:17] <%spiritofmojave> This one is basically "let them fight"
[5:52:19] <InfiniteSwagbito> Nah these 3 are just punching bags
[5:52:19] <bsmusic> This was interesting as Nero
[5:52:20] <%connos_livereview> subhuman is subsong
[5:52:23] <Zombrocom> Cavalier is so GOOD
[5:52:24] <b_ikki> yeah this is a gimmick floor
[5:52:25] <AlasterAngelo> they kill each other more than they kill you it's fine
[5:52:31] <bsmusic> Couldn't complete a buster
[5:52:32] <JanusII> I love Cavaliere. LUL
[5:52:42] <+tygermom> got dante is so broken
[5:52:45] <+tygermom> god
[5:52:47] <Phoenon> A couple of absolute units
[5:53:00] <darkvergillll> damn that thing got bodied
[5:53:00] <joylent_blue> behemoths are such tanks
[5:53:02] <+tygermom> you can just red hot night everything
[5:53:06] <InfiniteSwagbito> @tygermom Most definitely the strongest playable character in 5
[5:53:13] <%DedlokPM> Subhuman is better than the version they first released but it is also by far the worst battle theme in this game
[5:53:13] <%deviljhojho94> what a spectacular game this is really
[5:53:16] <mechslayer71> Guys, any idea how to set up the alternate voices for style rankings?
[5:53:20] <themechahobo> @tygermom No, it's the others who are too weak!
[5:53:21] <+tygermom> one shots every boss i this damn place
[5:53:22] <%deviljhojho94> if this does not win GOTY im going to fucking rage vomit
[5:53:23] <Zanzaken> @InfiniteSwagbito depends if you have your preferred arm for the floor where you fight them or not. It can range from being insanely hard to really simple.
[5:53:24] <joylent_blue> i feel like dante is the strongest playable character in anything
[5:53:28] <+tygermom> nero is busted as hell too
[5:53:33] <b_ikki> @mechslayer71 main menu>gallery>jukebox
[5:53:35] <AlasterAngelo> i think V is actually the strongest
[5:53:36] <%DedlokPM> @mechslayer71 In Gallery > Jukebox
[5:53:40] <AlasterAngelo> or at least the one that takes the least effort
[5:53:43] <+tygermom> no way
[5:53:46] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @DedlokPM 3rd place of 3 choices. Not bad, really
[5:53:47] <GandhiTheTerrible> @deviljhojho94 at the game awards? no way
[5:53:51] <zeroraider> subhuman is subpar
[5:53:52] <InfiniteSwagbito> V is the weakest on higher levels
[5:53:53] <+tygermom> V has a good damage output but so little level of control
[5:53:55] <joylent_blue> V has the highest skill floor
[5:53:58] <mechslayer71> @b_ikki I tried that, it said it would be random
[5:54:00] <%deviljhojho94> @GandhiTheTerrible I am already to vomit I know
[5:54:00] <b_ikki> dmc3 habit
[5:54:00] <%waifoong98> it has more frames
[5:54:02] <KingVantq> more i frames
[5:54:02] <joylent_blue> more frames
[5:54:03] <%DedlokPM> @Sphincter_Spelunker indeed
[5:54:04] <+StrokeGodMillionair> i frames if you fuck up
[5:54:05] <Djinnazz> DMC3
[5:54:05] <%Konquerer> more i frames
[5:54:07] <Megapikman132> @AngriestPat Invincibility frames from the jump
[5:54:09] <+tygermom> yeah more frame
[5:54:09] <Winterhearted13> More I frames.
[5:54:09] <%spiritofmojave> more i frames a la DMC3 ya
[5:54:10] <%Noahccountingfortaste> more i frames, I think
[5:54:10] <Phoenon> Jumping has i-frames, so you can just guard an attack mid-hit
[5:54:13] <+Prinny_Raider> jump iframes into royal guard immediately
[5:54:15] <+misterfistor> i thought it was lower startup frames
[5:54:16] <%Halowood> jump iframes + block frames
[5:54:19] <+tygermom> you have the I frames from the jump and the block
[5:54:22] <%Divryne> @AngriestPat You get iframes in the jump plus the royal guard frames.
[5:54:24] <Nyemmers> iframe + royalguard @AngriestPat
[5:54:29] <%Divryne> @AngriestPat So more safety.
[5:54:37] <Zanzaken> Because the jump has iframes so you can buffer a bad block timing with adding in the jump first.
[5:54:39] <Vasendak> for iframes + royalguard.. that was the rule in dmc3
[5:54:40] <InfiniteSwagbito> I should try that jump guard more often then
[5:54:41] <Phoenon> It's the equivalent of upbacking in guilty gear
[5:54:42] <+tygermom> also you can combo straight out of it
[5:54:47] <b_ikki> pretty sure it doesnt result in more iframes anymore
[5:54:47] <+tygermom> its the greatest thing ever
[5:54:52] <T_Sasquatch> @mechslayer71 There should be a gallery in the main menu, then go to jukebox
[5:54:54] <joylent_blue> fuck jumping we royal guard like men
[5:54:56] <b_ikki> since parrt has startup now
[5:54:59] <Zanzaken> It is NOT as good in dmc5 btw.
[5:55:00] <b_ikki> parry
[5:55:05] <%waifoong98> it is like using prosthetic in air like Sekiro Kappa
[5:55:08] <b_ikki> yeah it's pretty much a dmc3 habit
[5:55:10] <%Konquerer> it was second nature in 3 but i just do it on the ground now
[5:55:12] <Zanzaken> It's still "good" just not AS good as it was in 3 and 4.
[5:55:13] <+tygermom> oh yeah that might not matter anymore
[5:55:15] <joylent_blue> it looks so goofy LUL
[5:55:25] <Admiral_PopnFresh> short hopping like a true Melee player Kappa
[5:55:27] <+tygermom> man fuck i hate how much this game removes from the previous titles
[5:55:27] <InfiniteSwagbito> @b_ikki No, the parry is instant
[5:55:30] <+lumporr> is he doing a wavedash with dante
[5:55:33] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> are ya winin son?
[5:55:37] <%Noahccountingfortaste> please don't experiment with RG on BP...
[5:55:42] <Pseudonymity> rip
[5:55:43] <JanusII> This might be a bad time to learn a style.
[5:55:44] <%kiiiirsten> oh pat is still streaming wow I ahvent even seen one secnd of tonight
[5:55:49] <joylent_blue> health monkaS
[5:55:50] <%kiiiirsten> But I have also been drinking so fuck you/me!
[5:55:50] <$SGrim> Is level 56 really the place to be practing royal guard? rooThink
[5:55:52] <+lumporr> royal guard wavedashes am i hearing royal guard wavedashes
[5:55:56] <themechahobo> "Alright Floor 56, time to lab"
[5:55:58] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> No, experiment more on BP. Then we can see V tonight
[5:56:01] <+vextalyst> don't die with full dt
[5:56:04] <%Konquerer> no better time than the present
[5:56:14] <Phoenon> SOOPAH SKILLS
[5:56:15] <+tygermom> not broken at all
[5:56:17] <Zanzaken> @tygermom I wouldn't call it removing in this case. RG got so many upgrades in so many other ways and places that it had to take a few nerfs here and there.
[5:56:19] <lizard0tm> Did Woolie Stream BP? I'm surprised he's not right now
[5:56:21] <joylent_blue> LUL i love the sight of Dante just riding a motorcycle past enemies
[5:56:21] <Idon__> Thank you Lady
[5:56:26] <T_Sasquatch> im betting pat loses on mission 59
[5:56:26] <+tygermom> they nerfed a lot more
[5:56:31] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Woolie's jet lagged from PAX
[5:56:33] <+tygermom> and i still don't know how I feel about it
[5:56:33] <benjiFG> them boys
[5:56:36] <Admiral_PopnFresh> fucking Kalina Annes are so coole
[5:56:38] <AlasterAngelo> GUTS N HONOR
[5:56:40] <Zombrocom> I don't think woolie is home right now, or he just got home from PAX
[5:56:49] <InfiniteSwagbito> nice
[5:56:50] <KingVantq> @lizard0tm i dont think he finished the game yet i could be wrong
[5:56:51] <+tygermom> like no reverse hits even when you had it in the demo?
[5:56:52] <%connos_livereview> YOU CAN NOT THRILL ME IM ON OMEGLe
[5:56:53] <+tygermom> like why remove that
[5:56:54] <InfiniteSwagbito> double impact
[5:56:54] <joylent_blue> woolie went out into the world? DansGame
[5:56:59] <%waifoong98> Shame Wall running is still gone. oh well
[5:57:00] <+tygermom> if you already had it in the build
[5:57:04] <darkocore> Is this the first run?
[5:57:04] <lizard0tm> Ah
[5:57:12] <Phoenon> Interesting how DT can just save your style rank's ass so often
[5:57:13] <a_mad_dragon> the first dante run
[5:57:16] <extradopeness> Yeah i figure he just got off a plane
[5:57:16] <joylent_blue> darkocore he had one with nero, but this has gotten farther than that
[5:57:24] <Zombrocom> ITS OVER
[5:57:29] <%Dr00_PhD> THEY TALK?
[5:57:35] <joylent_blue> yeah the proto's talk
[5:57:37] <InfiniteSwagbito> nice
[5:57:37] <b_ikki> @tygermom pretty much for casual players not to have weird things happen to them while they play
[5:57:37] <benjiFG> nice
[5:57:40] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> naisu
[5:57:40] <%deviljhojho94> hot damn
[5:57:41] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> nice
[5:57:42] <bsmusic> PogChamp
[5:57:43] <manoshake> yooo
[5:57:44] <%spiritofmojave> nice
[5:57:45] <Zanzaken> @tygermom Yeah, I've played 3 and 4 for many years (mostly 4) and I'm kinda sad to see them gone but I enjoy what I have in 5 too much to get all up in arms about losing reveres and inertia.
[5:57:46] <AlasterAngelo> Protos are actually really nice people
[5:57:47] <JanusII> Holy shit.
[5:57:49] <joylent_blue> they say stuff that Vergil has said in previous games
[5:57:54] <Straxx__> RG for the win!
[5:57:54] <AlasterAngelo> Not like those Alaster Angelos
[5:57:54] <b1gboss007> fuck dmd proto angelos
[5:57:55] <manoshake> hahahaa
[5:58:04] <+tygermom> Yeah im enjoying it for sure now but im just concerned for the future
[5:58:08] <Saltmeisterr> Is the timer supposed ti discourage cheese strats?
[5:58:14] <+tygermom> idk if this game is gonna have the staying power of 4
[5:58:14] <%Noahccountingfortaste> @b1gboss007 get hit once and lose, yeah
[5:58:15] <lizard0tm> DMD was a pain in the ass to beat
[5:58:20] <manoshake> in the face
[5:58:22] <darkvergillll> rekt
[5:58:24] <lizard0tm> Took me 3 days to beat Vergil
[5:58:25] <Zanzaken> Yeah but 4 isn't going anywhere.
[5:58:29] <Megapikman132> Meanwhile, I'm still stuck on mission 18 on SoS
[5:58:34] <lizard0tm> As Dante
[5:58:34] <Megapikman132> I refuse to use Gorbs
[5:58:36] <joylent_blue> THAT looked weird
[5:58:43] <Admiral_PopnFresh> what was with that bullet trail?
[5:58:45] <a_mad_dragon> what was that angled line
[5:58:46] <AlasterAngelo> I cheesed DMD Urizen to get Heaven and Hell because fuck DMD
[5:58:52] <T_Sasquatch> 4 has a staying power because you didnt have choice
[5:58:53] <+Arbal3st> look at all these rorbs but no faust to spend them on
[5:58:54] <+vextalyst> Is there MULTIPLAYER IN BP
[5:58:59] <extradopeness> The shield break
[5:59:00] <Sahakitt> no
[5:59:00] <+vextalyst> oops caps
[5:59:01] <+tygermom> im sure this game is gonna take a spot next to 3 for me in the future
[5:59:02] <joylent_blue> it slowed down to show the shield was breaking, but the laser didn't like it
[5:59:04] <darkvergillll> 4 is really hard to replay now. single player is trash in that game
[5:59:04] <b_ikki> rip health
[5:59:08] <%Dr00_PhD> no
[5:59:11] <%DedlokPM> @Admiral_PopnFresh on the Kalina Anns? That was no bullet trail. It was a laser
[5:59:12] <Phoenon> I saw this one chick on youtube that had to use like 3 Gorbs on Vergil LUL
[5:59:18] <AshmanFTW> I'm still on mission 18 on SoS
[5:59:23] <joylent_blue> Phoenon goddamn it
[5:59:40] <lizard0tm> Hell and Hell is just fucking.... it's the Git Gud mode
[5:59:44] <FenixSeraph> grinding for DT
[5:59:49] <manoshake> wolf
[5:59:50] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 6 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 24oz (720mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[5:59:53] <+tygermom> 4 still is the best action game mechanically
[5:59:53] <lloyddboy> GO TO HELL
[6:00:00] <+tygermom> content wise this game has it beat tho
[6:00:04] <+misterfistor> thats a DMC3 Dante line
[6:00:05] <%deviljhojho94> wtf
[6:00:05] <AlasterAngelo> they're really nice
[6:00:06] <+roronoapedro> Good boy!
[6:00:07] <+SolverCODO> They have feelings too pat
[6:00:08] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> They sound like a modulated Dante
[6:00:11] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Needs more Dopplerganger from 3 mutterings
[6:00:14] <FenixSeraph> SPARDAAAA
[6:00:15] <Nyemmers> @lizard0tm or as max says it "borderline experimental mode"
[6:00:15] <+spiegelspike> hell judaica laughs at you
[6:00:16] <%spiritofmojave> Which is interesting because I don't think Nelo/Vergil did in 1
[6:00:17] <Phoenon> SourPls
[6:00:18] <joylent_blue> if you look at the trophy list on PS4, the percentage of people who have beaten mission 18 to people who have beaten the game has like a 20% difference LUL meaning those 20% just got stomped by Vergil
[6:00:19] <darkvergillll> i could care less about the lack of inertia
[6:00:19] <Saltmeisterr> SEED
[6:00:19] <Zanzaken> @tygermom I don't think anyone would argue any differently tbh.
[6:00:20] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> YEYEYE BEST THEME
[6:00:20] <Tampaoster> !uptime
[6:00:20] <invisi_bliss> remnants of vergil

[6:00:46] <%spiritofmojave> you can totally cheese him with Balrog or RG+Luce
[6:00:47] <b_ikki> there's no time horse fight
[6:00:48] <+tygermom> no time horse unfortunately
[6:00:49] <FenixSeraph> Shame the audio is all screwy
[6:00:50] <InfiniteSwagbito> There is no horse fight in BP
[6:00:51] <%waifoong98> @DedlokPM true
[6:00:53] <%Noahccountingfortaste> forma de SEETHING
[6:00:54] <b_ikki> no V bosses
[6:00:56] <Username_Needed> god the luce is so cool
[6:00:58] <+tygermom> i wish they had more bosses tbh

[6:01:00] <+roronoapedro> You can cheese everything with Luce.
[6:01:00] <themechahobo> Meteor!
[6:01:02] <Covil91> This boss is hilariously easy as V. Shadow parries everything.
[6:01:04] <Admiral_PopnFresh> no biggie, jus 55% of boss health gone
[6:01:07] <Phoenon> Time horse would have been interesting not playing V
[6:01:08] <Explodincatz> how many floors are there?
[6:01:09] <lloyddboy> no DT
[6:01:09] <%spiritofmojave> @roronoapedro Truee
[6:01:10] <%Agami23> just use mega laser to constantly knock cavalier out of the electricity
[6:01:11] <Zanzaken> @MightyMaxT None of V's bosses are in BP
[6:01:15] <joylent_blue> 101 floors
[6:01:15] <+theAncopro> you got no DT pat
