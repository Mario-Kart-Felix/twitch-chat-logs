[0:09:14] <Miss_Ebola> It is..?
[0:09:21] <spacecatstreams> pretty good so far
[0:09:22] <0rond> they nerfed hydra, but she is still pretty hard
[0:09:26] <Miss_Ebola> He's more annoying than hard.
[0:09:32] <0rond> the heads used to have a lot more HP
[0:09:32] <%Tearonex> oh wow

[0:09:44] <immortan_toecutter> Mmmmmmm bone snake
[0:09:50] <Miss_Ebola> But it might be due to the fact that I spend literal days just doing runs.

[0:10:04] <Miss_Ebola> Oof
[0:10:06] <%CJett92> I didnt know it got nerfed, I hadnt done any runns in a while

[0:10:28] <immortan_toecutter> Fight gooder
[0:10:30] <%wolfofsound> I find hydra to be fine, but alyseum eats my ass sometimes
[0:10:36] <0rond> the heads have less hp and everything is less aggresuve now
[0:10:38] <%Tearonex> wow this is a mess of a fight
[0:10:41] <princesspinkachu> Don’t step on bone snek he impervuss
[0:10:56] <%CJett92> I remember the first time I beat it I cheesed it super hard, got blade rift on dash and blade rift deflects projectiles, so it killed itself lol
[0:11:04] <Miss_Ebola> I tend to use wrath on the extra heads. Don't feel its worth it on the main head.

[0:19:40] <Tennochief> uh
[0:19:41] <isolex_> CHAOS
[0:19:43] <%badchoice5> CHAOS
[0:19:45] <isolex_> 👀
[0:19:45] <T_Sasquatch> Trojan Kappa
[0:19:47] <+Vestillion> No one else hears E1M1?
[0:19:48] <0rond> NO CHAOS
[0:19:50] <isolex_> :(
[0:19:58] <0rond> chaos at this point is too dangerous
[0:20:05] <%wolfofsound> @Miss_Ebola well get your F
[0:20:28] <Ion_Laser> @Vestillion I don't hear it
[0:20:28] <0rond> and it won't be worth it, by the time the chaos boon triggers he will have like 4 rooms left
[0:21:01] <immortan_toecutter> D O N A L S
[0:21:14] <Tennochief> what is the McDonalds of the gods?
[0:21:19] <0rond> shield knights are tough as shit
[0:21:21] <+Vestillion> well not now. But before when he was dicking around in that one area, it was playing the same notes. It was strange.
[0:21:22] <immortan_toecutter> People
[0:21:27] <%wolfofsound> @AngriestPat try and remember the tactics the new enemies use you'll need it for later
[0:21:29] <0rond> burst shot
[0:21:34] <%SirGO0SE> OH
[0:21:38] <princesspinkachu> McDonald’s mount Olympus location
[0:21:39] <%wolfofsound> I say pressure
[0:21:41] <%SirGO0SE> double gas
[0:21:47] <Miss_Ebola> Okay turns out I only had 3 nuggies so I put some fries in with it.
[0:21:51] <0rond> pressure is so low impact tho, 3%...
[0:21:59] <Miss_Ebola> He's still alive? I'm impressed.
[0:22:00] <angryoptimist> Heat + Toxic
[0:22:08] <Tennochief> Mount Olympus McDonalds lets you get unlimited BBQ sauce instead of charging you after getting 2 packets
[0:22:11] <Ion_Laser> @Vestillion The bass guitar earlier did sound like E1M1
[0:22:14] <immortan_toecutter> Insufficient nuggies. Reload save.
[0:22:18] <%doc_ock_rokc> God damn it Now I want a Gyro
[0:22:22] <%wolfofsound> he's leaving that food
[0:22:28] <0rond> don't do it, ares better
[0:22:35] <%SirGO0SE> gets rid of spin tho
[0:22:41] <+AllenDeadman> I would keep ares'
[0:22:42] <%wolfofsound> stay with ares
[0:22:48] <%GarbageNirvana> the unlimited BBQ sauce comes from Dionysus' cousin Jethro
[0:22:50] <Gregorhasjoined> 2000% THO
[0:22:55] <%wolfofsound> at this point your building your cast attacks
[0:22:59] <%SirGO0SE> 2000 is big number
[0:23:00] <princesspinkachu> Googles “McDonald’s nearest mt Olympus”
[0:23:03] <%wolfofsound> you're*
[0:23:05] <0rond> 2000 is only at max distance
[0:23:07] <%badchoice5> MOAR ARTEMIS
[0:23:09] <Miss_Ebola> GG
[0:23:18] <%wolfofsound> yeah he's dead
[0:23:19] <0rond> and it's radial, so some of them might miss at max distance
[0:23:25] <%Dr00_PhD> ok now i hear it
[0:23:33] <angryoptimist> The attack butterflies again.
[0:23:33] <immortan_toecutter> Try not dying
[0:23:42] <%wolfofsound> @0rond hear what?
[0:23:42] <Miss_Ebola> Oh god he's got a shield in there.

[0:24:35] <%wolfofsound> @0rond yeah no story content
[0:24:46] <0rond> yup, and it's not as cool either
[0:24:48] <%GarbageNirvana> well you know what they say about hindsight

[0:25:23] <0rond> it was really good run
[0:25:24] <Miss_Ebola> That was a great run though Pat.
[0:25:24] <T_Sasquatch> Ahhhhh rouguelikes
[0:25:25] <%CJett92> Ya super good run tho
[0:25:28] <0rond> the magic of twin shot
[0:25:31] <%wolfofsound> @AngriestPat you have to kill the pink ball
[0:25:40] <deviljhojho94> what a boomer
[0:25:41] <%SirGO0SE> because he hates your favorite band the most
[0:25:42] <%badchoice5> music festival
[0:25:45] <Miss_Ebola> You made me wear 4 pairs of pants and hate my life. So you got that going for you.
[0:25:47] <immortan_toecutter> You did good.
[0:25:50] <Tennochief> SHUT UP HYPNOS
[0:25:57] <princesspinkachu> Bubberfwies scary
[0:25:58] <%wolfofsound> @AngriestPat remember to give ambrosia to everyone
[0:26:14] <immortan_toecutter> Fuck you dad
[0:26:16] <%doc_ock_rokc> where is spot?
[0:26:39] <angryoptimist> Underdad's mad at what we'll do to his Yelp reviews.
[0:27:05] <immortan_toecutter> Bondage
[0:27:16] <princesspinkachu> Achilles is a scrub
[0:27:25] <%wolfofsound> Achilles is fucking great in this game
[0:27:27] <T_Sasquatch> Achilles mom is so fucking dumb
[0:27:28] <+AllenDeadman> orpheus is a woman...?
[0:27:30] <%GarbageNirvana> Wonder if the fact there are social links means there will be multiple endings
[0:27:39] <$joylent_blue> i want to brush Achilles's hair for him
[0:27:46] <T_Sasquatch> Just cover his heel. Simple
[0:27:49] <%wolfofsound> @AllenDeadman nah just high voice
[0:27:55] <%SirGO0SE> meg step on me
[0:27:59] <Tennochief> I wish we could date Meg
[0:28:03] <%Tearonex> Can't wait to all of the designs when they're done
[0:28:12] <immortan_toecutter> Tsun tsun Meg
[0:28:17] <+PunishedMercer_> hold meg's hand
[0:28:19] <%wolfofsound> @Tennochief we may get to see her in zag's room if he goes long enough
[0:28:23] <+Punchasaur> The Louis CK bit about Achilles is great
[0:28:34] <angryoptimist> Yeah, aren't the Furies usually busy yelling at living people?
[0:28:39] <immortan_toecutter> Does he masturbate during it?
[0:28:40] <%wolfofsound> @AngriestPat look on your desk
[0:28:49] <AerialChaos> That bed is too big
[0:28:49] <princesspinkachu> Guy is the original poison arrow receptacle
[0:28:49] <+Punchasaur> Well duh
[0:28:53] <0rond> this makes the game harder
[0:29:06] <%Dr00_PhD> Ah the Supergiant Penalties
[0:29:23] <AerialChaos> >Ooooh He exclamates, understanding not that which he gazed upon
[0:29:25] <0rond> @AngriestPat the last one will probably not harm you since you prolly didn't reach the cap yet
[0:29:55] <0rond> the last heat thing i mean
[0:29:56] <immortan_toecutter> Defy death. Become as gods

[0:30:58] <%wolfofsound> @Tennochief it's not what you think LUL
[0:30:59] <%CJett92> Thats a late game debuff I guess
[0:31:01] <Darkrenai> Its free money
[0:31:01] <Miss_Ebola> Ah shit my nuggies.
[0:31:02] <immortan_toecutter> F R E E
[0:31:06] <$HentaiSenpai9K> Free money
[0:31:24] <%some_sunflowers> Gun!
[0:31:26] <+allups> is this the good shit?
[0:31:38] <%SirGO0SE> skelly makin the ladies sploosh
[0:31:42] <immortan_toecutter> I like Paige’s boyfriend’s accent
[0:31:44] <Tennochief> @wolfofsound I don't care, I want Meg. I'll take any deal pssible
[0:31:55] <%SirGO0SE> give meg
[0:31:59] <%wolfofsound> GUN
[0:32:00] <spacecatstreams> skelly and zagreus are same voice actor
[0:32:10] <immortan_toecutter> Delightful
[0:32:10] <princesspinkachu> “weapon-wielding gents”
[0:32:13] <Tennochief> GUN ACHIEVED
[0:32:18] <Ion_Laser> GUN
[0:32:19] <0rond> skelly in the streets, zagreus in the sheets
[0:32:23] <%SirGO0SE> ancient greek GUN
[0:32:24] <%some_sunflowers> Give us some sweet right-clicks, Pat
[0:32:27] <%wolfofsound> @AngriestPat if you don't like the reload configure I'd change it
[0:32:35] <%CJett92> Skelly is the most relatable, because he too yearns for the sweet relief of death
[0:32:36] <%GarbageNirvana> Dude's all about eating shit huh
[0:32:52] <%wolfofsound> STRIKE
[0:32:52] <0rond> deflect dash prolly
[0:32:53] <princesspinkachu> Athena with that Marge Simpson hair
[0:33:01] <spacecatstreams> constant deflect will be p good
[0:33:01] <0rond> deflect attack is ok
[0:33:04] <T_Sasquatch> Wait, did she say cousin ?
[0:33:08] <%SirGO0SE> boom
[0:33:11] <+AllenDeadman> yes
[0:33:17] <+AllenDeadman> a son of hares would be cousing to athena
[0:33:20] <%ArcanumMBD> i prefer deflect dash, but deflect attack is probably pretty good with the gun
[0:33:20] <0rond> yeah, zag is hades' son, athena is zeus' daughter
[0:33:20] <spacecatstreams> @T_Sasquatch hades would be her uncle
[0:33:24] <+AllenDeadman> since she is a daughter of zeus
[0:33:30] <princesspinkachu> We’re all cousins here
[0:33:35] <T_Sasquatch> Oh yeaaaaa
[0:33:39] <%SirGO0SE> say hello to my little friend
[0:33:43] <Miss_Ebola> Okay nuggies update: They didn't burn. We're good.
[0:33:44] <+alphonseisbest> why does pat have a GUN?
[0:33:50] <T_Sasquatch> Damn I need to brush up on my Greek mythology
[0:33:51] <%wolfofsound> @alphonseisbest video game
[0:33:53] <Darkrenai> LUL
[0:33:57] <%wolfofsound> LUL
[0:34:01] <%MyDarkStorm> GUN the Most Powerful Equalizer
[0:34:02] <0rond> the classic greek mythology weapon, the [GUN]
[0:34:21] <angryoptimist> The family tree of the Greek pantheon is weirdly complicated knot.
[0:34:22] <spacecatstreams> weapon so powerful, the gods had to hide it away from the mortals
[0:34:25] <Miss_Ebola> Really don't like gun..
[0:34:33] <%wolfofsound> @0rond did you hate the reload configure?
[0:34:39] <immortan_toecutter> In plaguetucky we are all cousins
[0:34:42] <%SirGO0SE> Cult of Pat believes in power of [Gun]
[0:34:46] <%wolfofsound> Me either, I'm not a fan of the range only weapons
[0:34:59] <%CJett92> ZUES
[0:34:59] <0rond> i remeber something like that when the gun was added, i think they changed it too
[0:35:00] <angryoptimist> Also, the parentage of Zagreus is sometimes attributed to Hades, sometimes to Zeus. Who knows what they'll choose to do here.
[0:35:05] <Gadlight> the power of GON woolieOMG
[0:35:07] <Tennochief> BIG Z
[0:35:13] <%mh9s> Z MAN
[0:35:22] <spacecatstreams> noice
[0:35:22] <princesspinkachu> More proof of God cousin compound
[0:35:24] <%NovaKnightmare> this Zeus seems like a cool guy
[0:35:25] <%wolfofsound> Dash
[0:35:26] <suikudo> Whats this? Zeus not being an ass?
[0:35:26] <Tennochief> now turn into a swan and fuck some chick
[0:35:26] <0rond> EPIC
[0:35:29] <immortan_toecutter> Bestcest
[0:35:35] <%ArcanumMBD> heal that 1 hp
[0:35:39] <%wolfofsound> Now pump up those dash numbers
[0:35:40] <Zombrocom> What, Zagtrus isn't an OC?
[0:35:41] <%mh9s> amazing, Zeus didn't even try to fuck you
[0:35:41] <%Strider222> !uptime
[0:35:41] <%GarbageNirvana> Zeus probably just wants to stick it to Hades
[0:35:43] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 5m.
[0:35:54] <0rond> zag isn't OC, he is a very minor figure
[0:35:56] <mistermastergreg> man, this game looks great
[0:35:57] <+mayorrev> which God is the surfer dude, I think Poseidon?
[0:36:00] <Zombrocom> Huh
[0:36:05] <%wolfofsound> yes poseidon
[0:36:06] <+alphonseisbest> also why is pat British?
[0:36:08] <angryoptimist> Not *that* minor, I thought.
[0:36:08] <%SirGO0SE> oh that a good dash
[0:36:10] <Miss_Ebola> Ocean Man
[0:36:10] <%ogtrashwizard> @AngriestPat Dash only run!
[0:36:24] <%Typhaeon> That dash is some big damage
[0:36:24] <redial_nick> he died?
[0:36:32] <Miss_Ebola> Pat ain't British, he's Quebec.
[0:36:43] <@StridentSong> That's a Heat Gate Pat
[0:36:51] <@StridentSong> Requires a minimum amount of Heat to open
[0:37:04] <T_Sasquatch> Having a gun kind of makes the game lame to me tbh
[0:37:04] <0rond> but OG zag is actually the son of zeus and persephone, not hades and persephone, so who knows that might be the final twist
[0:37:10] <Miss_Ebola> I never actually did one of those cause I always get the 50-70 required ones.
[0:37:25] <%wolfofsound> @0rond that'd be pretty sick
[0:37:29] <JonnieCallan> Any date set for this hitting console?
[0:37:41] <T_Sasquatch> What's the point of all the cool aesthetics of you just have a [GUN]
[0:37:43] <@StridentSong> Heat Gates are 25 per floor
[0:37:44] <%GarbageNirvana> Not to my knowledge
[0:37:47] <%badchoice5> POWER
[0:37:54] <princesspinkachu> Poseidon most bad-tempered, shitbaggy Olympian god btw thus ocean is bitch
[0:37:56] <angryoptimist> @0rond Sometimes yes, sometimes no. Myths disagree. Basically, none of this is absolute.
[0:38:00] <InugamiTheHound> pat loves scar, scat fetish conformed
[0:38:03] <%wolfofsound> I'm hoping the next update is the final level or more story content
[0:38:07] <InugamiTheHound> scat not scar
[0:38:20] <+Revets315> this music is bumping
[0:38:21] <+go4thekneez> its a auto crossbow not a gun
[0:38:33] <T_Sasquatch> Might as well be playing enter the gungeon
[0:38:39] <immortan_toecutter> Wood gun is gun
[0:38:40] <angryoptimist> Also, Zagreus was sometimes folded into Dionysus for Reasons.
[0:38:41] <0rond> @AngriestPat GET DA JOLT.
[0:38:45] <%wolfofsound> @Revets315 yeah the soundtrack is great
[0:38:47] <angryoptimist> Or vice versa.
[0:38:52] <%GarbageNirvana> That's the other thing keeping me from picking this up, doesn't even have a final level yet
[0:38:54] <%mh9s> oooooooo
[0:38:55] <princesspinkachu> That’s clearly a glock 19 idiots
[0:38:55] <+kubozuka27> Power of da GUN

[0:39:08] <%doc_ock_rokc> Do it
[0:39:15] <%GarbageNirvana> ooo
[0:39:15] <0rond> jolt is real good
[0:39:26] <princesspinkachu> Hades is original kyle
[0:39:28] <%wolfofsound> good place for GOLD
[0:39:32] <Darkrenai> Dash only run LUL
[0:39:39] <angryoptimist> Maddad
[0:39:44] <immortan_toecutter> Punching holes in earth
[0:39:44] <%wolfofsound> this would be a good time for his deflecting
[0:39:45] <angryoptimist> MadDad?
[0:39:58] <+go4thekneez> this is some poe type build lol
[0:40:01] <0rond> FREE DAMAGE
[0:40:03] <%some_sunflowers> The ultimate cowardice, killing by running away.
[0:40:07] <JonnieCallan> Is this kind of like wizard of legend?
[0:40:15] <%mh9s> E Z P Z
[0:40:21] <princesspinkachu> SaltyPops™
[0:40:29] <immortan_toecutter> Kill by snitching. Just like with the fish people.
[0:40:40] <%ArcanumMBD> did Pat ever stream Wizard of Legend?

[0:58:56] <princesspinkachu> Zagreus needs Jesus
[0:59:10] <+Punchasaur> I like how Zeus’ kids keep getting roles as the protagonist in things

[1:28:40] <0rond> that's the issue, it's not great vs bosses, but it's good enough to be worth it
[1:28:55] <0rond> dont' fall for the poison
[1:29:03] <0rond> the poison wrath is bad and not worth it
[1:29:04] <spacecatstreams> rouge like: not quite red or purple, somewhere in between
[1:29:06] <+Punchasaur> Wow he is dio
[1:29:08] <%wolfofsound> dash I guess
[1:29:13] <+timblenaut> meh, w/e
[1:29:13] <0rond> dash
[1:29:14] <startstoprepeat> nasty dash is good

[1:29:18] <0rond> dash is ok
[1:29:19] <+Estuko> Nasty Dash sounds hilarious
[1:29:22] <pectusumbra> I'd say dash or wrath.
[1:29:27] <0rond> hit that dash
[1:29:27] <%SirGO0SE> nazty
[1:29:29] <her0_89> Kill things quicker Dash
[1:29:30] <pectusumbra> DR's really good when you can stack it
[1:29:31] <+MeatBomb> Nasty.
[1:29:36] <koolaid_kevster> yeeh
[1:29:43] <%wolfofsound> the wrath is trash cus it takes so long to charge for so little compared to other wrath
[1:30:04] <%wolfofsound> and the dash can stack
[1:30:28] <megakruemel> for just three damage this seems pretty reliable for some extra damage
[1:31:01] <SixthSun2> Did he just miss an upgrade
[1:31:37] <%doc_ock_rokc> @SixthSun2 no he got it
[1:31:57] <SixthSun2> Huh, I didn't think I saw him get it, but ok
[1:32:16] <%doc_ock_rokc> it was ambrosia

[1:40:10] <%wolfofsound> +3 casts
[1:40:24] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AllenDeadman 3 rounds of slow shard pickups for 6 shard clip after
[1:40:26] <megakruemel> that poison is so good though. it's free damage
[1:40:43] <%wolfofsound> yeah always go for damage not reduction if you can
[1:40:44] <+AllenDeadman> wew that's nice for this cast build
[1:40:56] <0rond> but every dash does free damage, poison is not the one of the better ones
[1:40:58] <Kalinflip> very gud

[1:41:49] <0rond> cast
[1:41:52] <%Skittlesoul> dash
[1:41:52] <Gadlight> 2 is better, 3 too risky
[1:41:57] <Swaron__> Lunge

[1:41:59] <seylumiue> Cast
[1:42:01] <Ids560> special's kinda whatever on shield

[1:42:03] <%wolfofsound> just remember LUL
[1:42:05] <BunnyEmperor> 2
[1:42:12] <moosemonkey397> its not even close, go with cast damage
[1:42:16] <Ids560> also isn't dash attack attacking after dashing?
[1:42:17] <baronvonbirman> The ruinous powers offer stength!
[1:42:19] <0rond> the dash is trash

[1:48:31] <Tennochief> whose boon does Pat have now, still Ares?
[1:48:35] <T_Sasquatch> I literally only bought transistor because of Willow years ago. 10/10
[1:48:46] <+6PoundsofShrimp> willow or woolie?
[1:48:52] <spacecatstreams> @6PoundsofShrimp when you beat transistor, woolie comes into your house and gives you a high five
[1:49:01] <+JavaManJoJo> something something, found the mobile user?
[1:49:08] <+6PoundsofShrimp> @spacecatstreams Holy shit, the rewards. So worth
[1:49:12] <%SirGO0SE> pretty sure ive gotten transistor for free with both twitch prime and ps+
[1:49:21] <T_Sasquatch> Only bad thing about transistor is when you figure out a combo that breaks the game and makes it easy
[1:49:30] <0rond> people always talk about transistor, no one remebers pyre
[1:49:32] <0rond> pyre was so good
[1:49:33] <ScreamLord> So is this what happened to the Hydra after Heracles killed it?
[1:49:40] <+iamnolionheart> Pyre absolutely was so good
[1:49:49] <%SirGO0SE> pyre had maybe the best music too
[1:49:52] <+Tokanova> what god power would zag give to another demigod if there was another game like this set in this same world

[1:50:29] <%wolfofsound> noice
[1:50:34] <%SirGO0SE> youve got his number today
[1:50:35] <%Lion_kun> do bosses that get killed stay dead?
[1:50:36] <%badchoice5> My sweet Zeus thy build is so mighty
[1:50:41] <T_Sasquatch> Popped a molly im sweating , woo
[1:50:44] <Tennochief> yes
[1:50:48] <%0raison> No its a roguelike
[1:50:48] <%Lion_kun> or is it like deadcells where you have to go through all of them again
[1:50:50] <%CJett92> One does not simply walk into Elysium
[1:50:51] <spacecatstreams> @T_Sasquatch shit that sounds fun
[1:50:54] <Tennochief> multiple times in fact
[1:50:56] <ScreamLord> "One does not simply walk into Elysium."
[1:51:02] <%0raison> with rotating bosses in certain sections
[1:51:05] <%wolfofsound> defiance woo!
[1:51:07] <0rond> skelly tooth
[1:51:13] <Swaron__> Hydra light wth
[1:51:27] <+6PoundsofShrimp> Is there an "end" to this game
[1:51:34] <%0raison> not yet
[1:51:34] <ScreamLord> Oh shit, you simply walked into Elysium
[1:51:36] <+iamnolionheart> Currently, no
[1:51:37] <+6PoundsofShrimp> or does it just cycle levels
[1:51:41] <megakruemel> it's what plants crave
[1:51:54] <%Lion_kun> i almost beat dead cells but that final boss i could not get past
[1:51:54] <+6PoundsofShrimp> Aye thanks dude
[1:51:58] <collindoucet99> Is your character a demigod? This is my first time seeing this game. @angriestpat
[1:52:03] <+iamnolionheart> It ends but it's not the ending, if that makes sense
[1:52:09] <%ArcanumMBD> King's Hand is legit
[1:52:13] <%Lion_kun> they should have done a checkpoint for that final boss, it's unfair to not let you learn his patterns
[1:52:39] <+6PoundsofShrimp> @iamnolionheart is it like RIsk of rain too where they is a final area but then it cycles or do u beat the boss and then finish the run issac style?
[1:52:48] <+iamnolionheart> Isaac style
[1:52:55] <+6PoundsofShrimp> Rad
[1:53:00] <%Lion_kun> also i think they made dlc where King's hand isn't even the final boss anymore lol
[1:53:06] <ScreamLord> 124/125 Full Life
[1:53:10] <T_Sasquatch> @lion_kun welcome to rogue likes
[1:53:13] <+6PoundsofShrimp> I prefer those.
[1:53:16] <+iamnolionheart> I'm so glad they added the ability to take two Daedalus Hammers
[1:53:32] <%Lion_kun> rogue legacy checkpoints at the final boss, I know because I beat it

[1:57:24] <@StridentSong> Hermes
[1:57:28] <jinking79> Treasure
[1:57:31] <Klarrann3> What's with the bow on the floor?
[1:57:31] <%wolfofsound> In this game's story they were raised as brothers and it's implied that meg and zag were a thing
[1:57:32] <+Estuko> @ScreamLord fuck that ruins my chances NotLikeThis
[1:57:33] <%Solidnick18> money
[1:57:41] <+ColonelRozum> the greeks were awesome everyone was boning

[1:57:43] <Kelevara> So is this a new content update?
[1:57:51] <%SirGO0SE> that put baby in a corner
[1:57:58] <+6PoundsofShrimp> @ColonelRozum Tell that to Ubisoft
[1:58:03] <spacecatstreams> @Kelevara its updated about a month ago
[1:58:04] <+AllenDeadman> we playing pinball now
[1:58:06] <0rond> meg has that old, cold ex hatred, thanatos got that fresh, straight out the oven lover scorned kinda deal going on
[1:58:15] <Kelevara> Cool, thanks spacecatstreams
[1:58:36] <%Solidnick18> hermes pls
[1:58:36] <+Estuko> @0rond meg steps on you, and Thanatos lets you step on him without admitting he's super into it.
[1:58:37] <collindoucet99> I’m assuming Zag is an original character? Because I’ve never heard of the name before in Greek myth
[1:58:38] <+iamnolionheart> I'll take Hades but a dating sim for 500, Alex
[1:58:43] <+6PoundsofShrimp> BE FAST AS FUCK
[1:58:45] <%CJett92> Dodge
[1:58:46] <%badchoice5> Dodge
[1:58:47] <+Tokanova> greater evasion
[1:58:48] <pectusumbra> haste
[1:58:48] <%SirGO0SE> quick recover and flat out speed seem amazing
[1:58:49] <+Greywyn00> just take dodge then
[1:58:50] <+AllenDeadman> dodge
[1:58:50] <0rond> dammit no rapid cast
[1:58:51] <+VektorTroika> You don't like f a s t?
[1:58:52] <a_mad_dragon> health recovery
[1:58:52] <Tennochief> I think Hermes is nice
[1:58:52] <%arcaderabbit48> Greater Haste seems solid
[1:58:53] <shevan123> just like hermes
[1:58:57] <%Solidnick18> dodge get health
[1:58:58] <nah_stradamus> elmo dodged away
[1:58:58] <%doc_ock_rokc> Herm would be a chain texter
[1:59:02] <Zombrocom> Zag isn't original, but pretty obscure
[1:59:03] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Big coward
[1:59:04] <Tennochief> ULTRA RAPID FAST
[1:59:05] <ScreamLord> God of War 3 kinda made me hate Hermes
[1:59:07] <%Solidnick18> ariessssssss
[1:59:07] <Zombrocom> As it turns out
[1:59:13] <collindoucet99> Who is the coolest god in this game?
[1:59:20] <%SirGO0SE> this one is your favorite huehue
[1:59:22] <+iamnolionheart> The Elysium music is so good
[1:59:32] <%wolfofsound> Coolest? Probably Ares
[1:59:36] <dekkitout> Dionysus us illest on the block, hands down
[1:59:41] <spacecatstreams> I like partyboy dionysus
[1:59:43] <+6PoundsofShrimp> Bro this looks so good, I'm so close to just buying it from epic.
[1:59:52] <collindoucet99> Wait are all of the main ones in this game?
[1:59:52] <%doc_ock_rokc> Fear the butterflies
[2:00:03] <+iamnolionheart> Even if you hate Epic I'd pick this up just to support Supergiant
[2:00:03] <%wolfofsound> I need my king butterfly
[2:00:29] <%doc_ock_rokc> @iamnolionheart I will never support epic! Supergiant can wait
[2:00:32] <ScreamLord> Dionysus has such a weird history. Apparently he's a god of Madness as well as partying.
[2:00:34] <synthdrive> When is this on steam?
[2:00:41] <%wolfofsound> if you want to buy it on epic just use paypal
[2:00:44] <Tennochief> 1 HEALTH
[2:00:54] <%doc_ock_rokc> @synthdrive september or so
[2:00:58] <+VektorTroika> EZ
[2:00:58] <0rond> oh my god
[2:00:58] <synthdrive> ah neat
[2:00:59] <%waltzqueen> 3hp
[2:01:00] <dekkitout> You say madness and partying, I say debauchery Kappa
[2:01:01] <+iamnolionheart> Current gods are: Hades, Zeus, Posideon, Ares, Athena, Artemis, Dionysus, Hermes, Thanatos, Hypnos, uhh
[2:01:01] <ScreamLord> CLUTCH!!!!!!
[2:01:03] <%arcaderabbit48> About how finished is this game now? Do we have any idea?
[2:01:04] <%SirGO0SE> clench
[2:01:04] <+AllenDeadman> 1 HP WutFace
[2:01:05] <0rond> don't switch
[2:01:07] <spacecatstreams> @AngriestPat I bet if you stream this the day of the next major update, the Supergiant team will watch your stream. thats what they were doing in the noclip doc for the last update
[2:01:09] <0rond> WRATH
[2:01:18] <collindoucet99> COOL @iamnolionheart
[2:01:19] <+6PoundsofShrimp> @iamnolionheart True but Epic has already supported the fuck out of them so they seem kinda set for the time being
[2:01:23] <GMN1> 1 HP sethorOkay
[2:01:26] <%wolfofsound> WRAAAAAAATH
[2:01:30] <+iamnolionheart> Big ol shruggu
[2:01:49] <%wolfofsound> jesus those casts are strong
[2:01:56] <Tennochief> those are the bolts of zeus right?
[2:02:01] <%doc_ock_rokc> Supergiant got 1 million units sold with just epic so they don't need support at the moment
[2:02:01] <%wolfofsound> ya
[2:02:04] <Tennochief> thanks
[2:02:04] <collindoucet99> fuck this game really makes me want a Percy Jackson game. I loved those books as a kid
[2:02:18] <%wolfofsound> what worries me is the boss fight though
[2:02:20] <+6PoundsofShrimp> @collindoucet99 I've only ever seen the move

[2:16:31] <+VektorTroika> since when were the poppy bros part of greek myth?
[2:16:31] <%arcaderabbit48> Honestly, Dashing seems to br your primary method of movement anyway so the speed reduction isnt that punishing
[2:16:32] <+bubbli97> @AngriestPat Hey Pat do you say in your FF14 Beginners Guide how to manage the action bar? I'm at lvl 42 now and mine is getting pretty full and clunky to use.

[2:19:44] <anar_bael> BIG CHOP
[2:19:44] <%Agami23> but arnt you about to get a big special boost from chaos?
[2:19:45] <0rond> the crit is % damage too
[2:19:48] <+AllenDeadman> crit build
[2:19:52] <Gadlight> yeah aspd
[2:19:52] <moragtang> The big chop makes the crit deal like 500 damage;
[2:19:54] <%badchoice5> crit for less
[2:19:55] <0rond> it will make the crit do less damage too
[2:20:00] <pectusumbra> you use special alot it seems like
[2:20:01] <Hydrapissed> Big special
[2:20:08] <%Doruben> your chaos was special boost
[2:20:08] <%badchoice5> Nova
[2:20:09] <Gadlight> 2 is better i think
[2:20:10] <anar_bael> world spilter makes number go up though
[2:20:11] <%Agami23> so keep stacking special
[2:20:11] <+VektorTroika> boost it MORE
[2:20:11] <a_mad_dragon> NOVA
[2:20:12] <%SirGO0SE> i crit my pants

[2:20:13] <%Typhaeon> Supernova seems good
[2:20:14] <pectusumbra> though admittedly it's a question of how good marked is

[2:20:44] <anar_bael> welp, looks like this is a t-pose run
[2:20:45] <+BubbaRands> Why does this game HAVE to be on the Epic Games Store? it looks way to fun NotLikeThis
[2:21:06] <+VektorTroika> give it a year, they'll port it to steam
[2:21:07] <anar_bael> it sucks bubba
[2:21:07] <%Typhaeon> That special is absurd
[2:21:08] <Tomschiii> it will come to steam
[2:21:10] <pectusumbra> @BubbaRands just wait for it to be done and out on other platforms
[2:21:12] <+iamnolionheart> It will be coming to Steam at launch if that helps
[2:21:12] <%Solidnick18> nice
