[0:26:56] <%iaraCatunda> god I wish I had that much roads
[0:26:56] <blaggablag> yeah my game was chugging hard yesterday
[0:26:56] <%sovayell> @AngriestPat you can try and continually boost to see if it triggers, thats what i tried to get norman to shill
[0:26:59] <HyperBomb21> Yeah i noticed
[0:26:59] <+orthodoxwaffle> i suspended 100% through the game
[0:27:00] <bahamut1010> is this Final Fantasy XV now??
[0:27:04] <wannabemoogle> oof
[0:27:07] <nevan0> OOF
[0:27:11] <%megabrogus> theres also definitely a memory leak on ps4 fallen order. whats up with games this month?
[0:27:11] <%Laecerelius> Red truck!
[0:27:13] <rytisone> maybe console is melting
[0:27:16] <didjorno> fun fact Die hardmans full name is John Blake Mcclane. You know, like the die hards
[0:27:18] <lyzejag> @subdude_ Same yeah
[0:27:21] <%Meow0369> This fucking road is awful
[0:27:24] <+ConLin_Arts_> spoopy ghosties
[0:27:27] <TheSandmanIsHere> @bahamut1010 nah, they actually finished making this game before releasing it
[0:27:28] <$Wnds> can BTs even catch you on a bike? lol
[0:27:29] <%Meow0369> they need to patch an option to skip the animation for this
[0:27:34] <Daxalog> Why is their slowdowns when you travel on the road sometimes?
[0:27:35] <NotHereToStream> man these slow downs are annoyhing
[0:27:40] <blaggablag> The Heartman cutscene made my playstation wheeze for like 10 minutes
[0:27:45] <$eskerpole> Looool
[0:27:45] <maxpasta> Ghosts!
[0:27:46] <+2DSuperiority> This would never happen on an episode of Ride with Norman Reddus
[0:27:46] <%honeyman18> Has he gotten the Paduru hat yet?
[0:27:56] <corpsegoo> honestly I assume it's never getting patched because it's a hide the load times anymation
[0:27:56] <+griffball13> @AngriestPat have you ever had to repair a road?
[0:27:58] <Mendin> So I didn't realize until a day or two ago, but during that pause when vehicles short-out and just before BTs begin? Norman gets the piss-shivers, ie his DOOMS goosebumps are kicking in
[0:27:59] <marvel877> That animation is clearly a load screen. It will probably be skippable on PC later.
[0:28:00] <corpsegoo> *animation
[0:28:01] <%primax104> @Wnds if they are directly in your way then they can catch you on the bike
[0:28:06] <%dreamfillah> try to dismount and get back on the bike?
[0:28:06] <bahamut1010> @thesandmanishere the only thing I see is Roads and empty fields just like FFXV
[0:28:06] <+orthodoxwaffle> I love the end where Higgs turned out to be Conan Obrien in disguise
[0:28:18] <blaggablag> Ah by the way the playstation theme for this game is pretty baller
[0:28:18] <fist_wizard_jay> piss off ghosts I got roads
[0:28:18] <@commanderclaw> How many asses did you haul?
[0:28:20] <$Wnds> @primax104 but i mean you can still get away from them on the bike after they start grabbing at you, can't you?
[0:28:21] <worldbrand> try yelling?
[0:28:23] <$onlypuppet> Patience is a bitch
[0:28:24] <HoIlywood_SN> @AngriestPat Norman Memus dabs on you by refusing to say the words
[0:28:25] <%jcenderion> Yell button?
[0:28:27] <%sovayell> @AngriestPat might just be pure random then, sorry it didnt help
[0:28:28] <%Maids4lyfe> he's on a mission
[0:28:30] <%dreamfillah> maybe its off-road?

[0:29:00] <jetvillain> !uptime
[0:29:00] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 29m 2s.
[0:29:02] <%BurningLlama777> That makes me so hype I'm gonna go watch MythBusters right now!
[0:29:03] <marvel877> Barely. The voice audio was drowned out by the timefall noise.
[0:29:03] <wannabemoogle> And you can barely hear it cuz of the rain
[0:29:03] <%jcenderion> THE BEST WORST EVER apatPorgmo

[0:29:04] <+machshop> @SWFanatic fuuuuuck
[0:29:06] <%Divryne> It's the best bike in the game.
[0:29:08] <%primax104> @Wnds they actually knock you off the bike if they get a hold on you. That is what happened to me at least.
[0:29:09] <superd4v3> @AngriestPat Imagine if Norman retweeted you
[0:29:11] <%rumtumtugnutz> and in that moment I knew, it was truly time to Ride with Norman Reedus.
[0:29:13] <+ConLin_Arts_> I think this might actually be my GOTY
[0:29:13] <Delenay> is ride with normal reedus the only piece of media that survived the death stranding?
[0:29:14] <munchkay> what did he saidm
[0:29:16] <startstoprepeat> you can't colour it so it sucks
[0:29:18] <TheRamu99> @AngriestPat cant believe how well this runs on the stadia
[0:29:18] <%honeyman18> Defense, Battery, storage
[0:29:19] <%Meow0369> old game?
[0:29:21] <Jolnir> kojima really needed the money
[0:29:21] <$Wnds> @primax104 ahh okay. makes sense. thanks :)
[0:29:24] <+griffball13> @AngriestPat have you ever had to repair the roads?
[0:29:26] <+ConLin_Arts_> Heartman has a ton of movies
[0:29:38] <HoIlywood_SN> @AngriestPat Ride With Norman Memus
[0:29:40] <%honeyman18> I think they chop them up if you scan them into sections
[0:29:41] <corpsegoo> also like half your deliveries are pre stranding media
[0:29:42] <%iaraCatunda> holy shit
[0:29:44] <%primax104> @Wnds np
[0:29:45] <%Laecerelius> Roads stronk!
[0:29:47] <%iaraCatunda> my games the same
[0:29:47] <+orthodoxwaffle> I paved every road myself cause everyone else on my shard were lazy fucks
[0:29:49] <%Maids4lyfe> roads do not need repairing
[0:29:52] <SubliminaIMessages> Sam is just a big ol goofvall
[0:29:52] <%Meow0369> Well it is still the release month
[0:29:53] <%ace_cfa44> ace_cfa44 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 18 months! hey pat, moved and quit my job since they didn't have a position to transfer me to in near the new place, plus I got an acute sinus infection that required a hospital visit, your streams have been keeping me going though, sincerly thank you
[0:30:02] <LilacsandFreedom> wish roads were like that in real life
[0:30:05] <%Alig200> yeah, roads can only be repaired at <90% and generally everyone else does it for you.
[0:30:07] <%Meow0369> Later in the year and in time in general it'll become apparent how it really is
[0:30:08] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> no
[0:30:08] <$Wnds> @ace_cfa44 damn dude, hope you get better soon :(

[0:30:17] <%WhereIsWill> truckin is a lifestyle LUL
[0:30:18] <$eskerpole> Do you think you have an edge since people will be looking out for your name for likes and help?
[0:30:18] <wannabemoogle> Truckings an attitude
[0:30:19] <%Laecerelius> Roads in real life need to be filled with undead time crystals
[0:30:21] <%akaAxi0m> We're "trikin"
[0:30:21] <Mister_McDerp> NOT TRUCKING
[0:30:21] <tr00ly_> trucking is a state of mind
[0:30:22] <+D00msDayDan> trucking isn't about what vehicle you use, it's a state of mind
[0:30:23] <%skizzuto> we're TRIKIN
[0:30:24] <blaggablag> Living that reedus life
[0:30:25] <%dreamfillah> ngl there is something appealing about just looking at landscapes and vistas while on a Ride, with Norman Reedus
[0:30:25] <%Rumbutt> We're RIDIN' (With Norman Reedus)
[0:30:26] <+Tyonidus> East bound and down?
[0:30:29] <%ThatOneGuyYouSaw> isn't that a tricycle?
[0:30:35] <%Fenrirlives> @angriestpat you're Trucking Adjacent
[0:30:38] <%Meow0369> literally shoot your baby with a gun probably
[0:30:38] <%SWFanatic> eat ass, wash hands
[0:30:40] <+orthodoxwaffle> @skizzuto nice
[0:30:58] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> swamp ass
[0:31:08] <blackesteagle> audio noises are the worst, without audio they are peachy
[0:31:12] <fist_wizard_jay> swass?
[0:31:13] <corpsegoo> the swamp shit is such a trap, I've lost six bikes in there
[0:31:14] <%ace_cfa44> thanks @Wnds , got some prescriptions from the hospital yesterday and the worst of it seems to be gone now
[0:31:15] <blaggablag> I'm assuming it was supposed to distribute to the west coast but then the tar happened
[0:31:16] <%crimsonharvest> for real though w hy does this bike have a constantly rising tone like its shifting gears, its electric
[0:31:16] <+Mistheart101> born on a mountain raised in a cave, trucking and fucking are all i crave
[0:31:22] <redrins> what's stopping them from sniping your bb
[0:31:28] <+J_Papa> This Distro Center is much shittier than the others

[0:31:53] <$Wnds> pat the liar, confirmed
[0:31:54] <X4phantom> How far is Pat in game?
[0:31:55] <+ConLin_Arts_> Did you know Norman Reedus' son is called Mingus Reedus?
[0:31:56] <$onlypuppet> This hole is so fucking deep, why is it even here?
[0:31:59] <%crimsonharvest> in real terms this road is probably far more valueable than network spokes
[0:32:00] <valriot> Pat the Liar, stole my roads
[0:32:00] <ShadeNightz> Lie-Catman.
[0:32:06] <HoIlywood_SN> i wonder if anyones watching -- RIDE WITH NORMAN REEDUS WOOHOOO WAHOOO PIZZA MONSTER
[0:32:08] <%Fenrirlives> I will never Trust The Pat again!
[0:32:12] <%Meow0369> This area sucks dicks without roads but costs insane amount
[0:32:12] <superd4v3> @AngriestPat I did a little grinding off-stream, you know how it is
[0:32:13] <Mister_McDerp> been grinding roads offscreen
[0:32:14] <SoySocks> good evening pat and chat
[0:32:15] <wannabemoogle> offf
[0:32:16] <%Laecerelius> So it's like leveling up in an RPG
[0:32:17] <corpsegoo> them bb pods survive void outs, it's surviving a bullet
[0:32:19] <+machshop> (unless you wait til you connect the network)
[0:32:19] <%xtremegamer80> And you are wrong a lot of times, like yesterday
[0:32:20] <%iaraCatunda> holy shit I can't believe you built all that
[0:32:21] <lyzejag> yuuuuup
[0:32:21] <Nina96> oof
[0:32:22] <blaggablag> 7k ceramics, it's bullshit
[0:32:28] <valriot> Yeah but share it with other people??
[0:32:29] <%primax104> does Pat clear out mule camps?
[0:32:30] <Arweynn> WHAT 9000?!?
[0:32:35] <%WhereIsWill> this area mustve been a PAIN
[0:32:35] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> are there any more roads to build?? ;_;
[0:32:36] <rytisone> these trips need some music
[0:32:37] <wannabemoogle> Thats alot of raiding to do
[0:32:37] <blaggablag> I exhausted the entire map's reserve and still haven't been able to end it
[0:32:40] <%iaraCatunda> @angriestpat where do you get the materials?
[0:32:42] <+Deadbulky> Deadbulky subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[0:32:43] <seycheles> big pat roads
[0:32:44] <%ThatOneGuyYouSaw> @AngriestPat did you unlock the mecha yet?
[0:32:47] <+Mistheart101> man this game feels like a Podcast Game
[0:32:51] <%Laecerelius> It's so good, gurl!
[0:32:52] <$eskerpole> No more zip lines?
[0:32:53] <%StaceMcGate> I'm late, how many ROADS did I miss?
[0:32:55] <%honeyman18> 5 star faculties help, they have a huge ass cap for resources.
[0:32:57] <+machshop> piss off ghost
[0:33:01] <%primax104> @Mistheart101 absolutely
[0:33:08] <NotHereToStream> missed opportunity in this game is no audio log
[0:33:10] <blaggablag> You put on some low roar

[0:33:16] <%Meow0369> I really do wish you could disable the animation for the arm thing when BTs appear, it's so annoying
[0:33:16] <$onlypuppet> OH right, sorry it’s been years
[0:33:16] <+Punchasaur> 9000 CUMBOS?
[0:33:16] <%Laecerelius> TRUCK IT UP!
[0:33:16] <ape_hawk> yeah, YOU CAN PUT ON THE TALKING DEAD
[0:33:16] <+subdude_> That's how I played it.

[0:33:20] <marvel877> LITTLEST HOBO THEME INTENSIFIES
[0:33:21] <corpsegoo> some of the preppers start giving you batches of light weight 1k materials so it gets way easier to build roads once you start five starring people
[0:33:22] <wannabemoogle> Catch a riiiiiiiiiiiiide
[0:33:23] <%LuckyLagomorph> apatBig truckin
[0:33:24] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> PISS OFF GHOSTS!
[0:33:26] <%Valdorick> Get fucked ghosts, he's on the road
[0:33:27] <%Fenrirlives> it'd be great if that was built in!
[0:33:34] <+machshop> LUL
[0:33:35] <%iaraCatunda> I wish u could play the data and emails and interviews as a podcast while I play
[0:33:40] <%skizzuto> ghosts HATE roads
[0:33:40] <valriot> Country Truuuuckkkk, Holy fuckkkkk, I'm so cool, Just like Riiide
[0:33:42] <%honeyman18> It pairs weird with my murder podcasts I like.
[0:33:43] <%Laecerelius> Ghosts HATE infrastructure! they HATE IT!
[0:33:45] <%WhereIsWill> you can even put on the CSB in the background that crazy
[0:33:47] <%sovayell> im playing it right now while I listen to play it right now apatSkelmo
[0:33:49] <%BurningLlama777> I like how you have to zoom in and watch the scene every time.
[0:33:50] <chidere> Listen to Castle Super Beast while grinding my roads
[0:33:50] <%rumtumtugnutz> I've been thinking about doing a podcast but all I'm good at is getting mad at comic books.
[0:33:55] <blaggablag> This entire stretch of road is so stupid
[0:33:55] <Mendin> Look at this fucky serpentine road
[0:33:58] <+machshop> yeah i hate that the files aren't in tape form like in phantom pain
[0:33:59] <Delenay> are we on a mario kart race track here?
[0:33:59] <+J_Papa> This part of the road can eat shit though
[0:33:59] <%Takreth> Mute the stream and put on CSB
[0:34:00] <%crimsonharvest> oh wow legit switchbacks
[0:34:02] <Teyaric> What is this unsupported spiraling BS?
[0:34:02] <+JuiceST> I've also had to build nearly all the roads. does it even work any other way?
[0:34:03] <HoIlywood_SN> Ghosts hate Ride with Norman Reedus, thats why we need to piss and fart on them
[0:34:06] <+profanityincluded> this road never got built in my game, shit was rough
[0:34:06] <%Rumbutt> Play Country Roads Cyberpunk cover while playing this game
[0:34:07] <Mister_McDerp> the road is the ghost's natural predator
[0:34:08] <wannabemoogle> its spoopy
[0:34:08] <%Deadbulky> apatDab
[0:34:11] <ovan20> GO BIG MAN PAT, DELIVER THOSE PACKAGES! rooPog
[0:34:11] <%Meow0369> They are real
[0:34:11] <valriot> Kreygasm
[0:34:11] <%LuckyLagomorph> no
[0:34:14] <%Valdorick> Made with the Blodd Sweat and Tears of Patriots. Ghosts hate it.
[0:34:16] <+Mistheart101> yeah this doesnt feel structurally sound
[0:34:16] <%Fenrirlives> that is a groady under road
[0:34:16] <LilacsandFreedom> but it looks cool
[0:34:21] <%megabrogus> @rumtumtugnutz thats definitely enough for a podcast
[0:34:22] <+penndra> it's so cool though!!
[0:34:22] <Mendin> It's Chiral, we aint gotta explain shit
[0:34:24] <%Meow0369> They're explained as being real roads from a time long ago, summoned by your materials
[0:34:26] <%iaraCatunda> it cannot be good for the situation of the planet
[0:34:26] <+BringBackSempai> its chiral road material
[0:34:26] <%chiluzza> yeah they sure did capture rocky mountain roads
[0:34:27] <%crimsonharvest> its like levitating from chiral shit right
[0:34:27] <%skizzuto> it's Rainbow Road from mario kart but not as cool and lower to the ground
[0:34:29] <redrins> less steep inclines this way
[0:34:30] <%chiluzza> so many fucking switchbacks
[0:34:30] <$onlypuppet> I know some ghosts, they’re not so bad
[0:34:31] <tr00ly_> this is a fuckin slog huh
[0:34:31] <+profanityincluded> jesus christ this road
[0:34:31] <%Laecerelius> I'm assuming they're like that because that was what the landscape was like before the timerain or whatever
[0:34:37] <+BringBackSempai> I think its actually pulling part of the beach to make the road
[0:34:37] <%Meow0369> At least I'm pretty sure that was the explanation I might've dreamed it all up
[0:34:37] <+Mistheart101> aesthetically it's cool but also i would not want to drive on those roads, that'd make me anxious as fuck
[0:34:39] <Artista_AF> I guess Ghosts respect Ghost Road traffic laws
[0:34:39] <corpsegoo> gotta use the chrial tech wherever you can since everything's already iradiated with it
[0:34:42] <+Punchasaur> Ghosts don’t have their drivers licenses
[0:34:45] <%Fenrirlives> @angriestpat well it is made via ghost beach power
[0:34:46] <%Ner234> Holy shit this would've been a hell of a trip without these roads
[0:34:47] <blaggablag> this bike just reeeeeeees along I love it
[0:34:50] <$eskerpole> Why you driving so crazy
[0:34:50] <Delenay> now lets see the bs ziplines
[0:34:52] <+J_Papa> It would be interesting if the more structures you built the more BTs were around
[0:34:54] <%poohtrailsnailcooch> Now its time to watch the same shit i did all day
[0:34:56] <seycheles> @chidere oh thank god I thought I was the only one who listened to the podcasts while pat streams
[0:34:56] <%Meow0369> Yeah I'm pretty sure it's pulling from the beach @AngriestPat So they're real roads from a time long gone
[0:34:59] <ovan20> PCC rooPog
[0:35:00] <Mendin> Now remember folks, Minh/Billy built ALL THESE ROADS before doing the first big story mission from Lake Knot City
[0:35:01] <eco419> Kojima would be proud
[0:35:06] <danpc5> BCCH
[0:35:07] <+JuiceST> I think I have just the one last, super expensive stretch of road left to build. it's a bastard
[0:35:08] <%Laecerelius> Free stuff!
[0:35:11] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> gib
[0:35:12] <jacknerik> Minh is nuts
[0:35:13] <%Strider222> what happened to PCC 1?
[0:35:17] <%Valdorick> Its free money
[0:35:18] <omegadarknes> howl ong has the stream been going so far?
[0:35:19] <Nina96> @angriestpat is your sleep still fucked?
[0:35:22] <%TDAWS_MP132> @dan so it wasn't just me
[0:35:29] <TheSandmanIsHere> now we reach the end of the road
[0:35:30] <$eskerpole> Rob and roll
[0:35:34] <%Laecerelius> Reedus bike MUST remain young and strong!
[0:35:35] <+TheRealMasterof7s> God, they couldn't give those bikes better handling?
[0:35:37] <%TDAWS_MP132> @danpc5 so it wasn't just me
[0:35:39] <%Rumbutt> WOOO
[0:35:41] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> YEYEYEYEYE
[0:35:42] <%LuckyLagomorph> I wonder how
[0:35:43] <rytisone> It's a Normanmobile
[0:35:47] <ovan20> so hard rooSmug
[0:35:48] <+Splatterfest> Is this game like breath of the wild where you can do the main quests but everything else is extra
[0:35:49] <wannabemoogle> Did he just woooo?
[0:35:51] <%iaraCatunda> LUL
[0:35:51] <%This_is_Marco> rip arms
[0:35:52] <+profanityincluded> Pat is further than i though, we reaching the mid-late game
[0:35:54] <%Fenrirlives> Sam's arm is SO STRONG
[0:35:57] <omegadarknes> hope i didn't miss any story
[0:36:00] <%primax104> this looks cool
[0:36:02] <+Punchasaur> PCC is the acronym for my college so whenever I hear it I think about homework:(
[0:36:07] <%Conyst> now for the zipline infrastructure
[0:36:08] <TheSandmanIsHere> his wanking arm is beastly
[0:36:10] <+Splatterfest> this is the coolest zipline ever
[0:36:12] <%GeneralSCPatton> This is just like Zip with Norman Reedus on AMC
[0:36:16] <%Anime_Flux> Zippin', with Sam America
[0:36:17] <%crimsonharvest> isnt this fresh rain why isnt it aging your face
[0:36:18] <seycheles> 🤔
[0:36:19] <+0oki> Building a network of cables in the mountains was so satisfying
[0:36:19] <%megabrogus> jesus pat how many hours did you spend on this shit
[0:36:20] <ovan20> @AngriestPat is Sam holding 300 kilos with one arm? LUL
[0:36:20] <+flamingmonkies2> the most perfect gameplay
[0:36:24] <danpc5> @TDAWS_MP132 Ye xD ,i keep remembering policenauts
[0:36:25] <wannabemoogle> The wiplash from this would suck so bad
[0:36:25] <maxpasta> What new upgrades did you get?
[0:36:28] <%Takreth> thanks Shocks
[0:36:32] <%Takreth> and thanks Pat
[0:36:32] <%Alpha8087> Paaaat
[0:36:33] <%sovayell> skipping gameplay DansGame
[0:36:44] <tactician0> guess you just won't cryShrug
[0:36:46] <+J_Papa> Sam's superpower is carrying outrageous loads
[0:36:46] <Scrub_Seeker> i JUST realized he's using the other part of his cuff to ride the zipline
[0:36:47] <%chiluzza> fuck sinus infections
[0:36:48] <%crimsonharvest> get well soon donor
[0:36:48] <+subdude_> Your zipline network looks identical to mine
[0:36:49] <%Laecerelius> You could ignore the non-main story stuff but it'd probably get pretty rough without having roads and ziplines and the upgrades for 5 starring stuff
[0:36:49] <Mister_McDerp> sinus infections suck
[0:36:56] <Mendin> I can hear the Price is Right yodeling ski lift music during all this fast-travel
[0:36:59] <%Animorphimagi> we missed him finding the first prepper?
[0:37:00] <purple_bagel> Hot take: ziplines should only work downhill, they’re too strong how they are now
[0:37:00] <TheSandmanIsHere> better than an ugly sinus infection
[0:37:01] <wannabemoogle> ugh sinuses are the worst
[0:37:01] <%Meow0369> dude go to the doctor more often if you need hospital, if you get sick go to a GP take care of yoself
[0:37:06] <%honeyman18> If he dies from having his arm ripped off, would he get it back when he repatriates?
[0:37:07] <+profanityincluded> imagine the no-pcc run
[0:37:13] <OvaltineDream> he does have help from a load bearing ass
[0:37:15] <+Splatterfest> you know maybe
[0:37:19] <%Meow0369> Pat you've been wrong about Woolie with this game before
[0:37:19] <ovan20> probably LUL
[0:37:20] <rytisone> he'll just mainline it
[0:37:22] <%iaraCatunda> is there ifood memes about DS where y'all live ? or is that a Brazilian thing?
[0:37:24] <eco419> Woo
[0:37:25] <valriot> Snail Stranding
[0:37:26] <redrins> death snailding
[0:37:27] <%cherubs_anonymous> This is such an anti-Woolie game
[0:37:27] <+J_Papa> Is Woolie doing a full LP?
[0:37:29] <WhizKid38> Do those ziplines break the game
[0:37:30] <$Wnds> it'll take him longer either way, woolie is bad at video games Kappa
[0:37:32] <%Meow0369> It's gonna take him 5 seconds to build a full zipline network
[0:37:33] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Woolie's still in Tutorial Land
[0:37:34] <%Fenrirlives> it's fine, Minh should do it in secret
[0:37:35] <jimmytwofeet> YOU'RE INCREDIBLE
[0:37:35] <jacknerik> oh the FUCK did someone get a bike up here
[0:37:40] <%Strider222> GROSS
[0:37:41] <%Kirby_Sauce> cheer500 hey red bar hair and red bar quarter-hair! how ya do! can't stay long, as i've only 5 minutes off this class break. why you strem so early? anyway, got an overnight after school today, and another one after that. I just wish the sewer would stop overflowing in the back of the store at night. makes the whole place smell like shit.
[0:37:42] <%GeneralSCPatton> Longer, but more importantly, it'll be less cool than BECOMING SPEED
[0:37:44] <seycheles> asking for help is a sign.

[0:37:45] <+wynnewake> yummi cryptobiotes

[0:37:46] <%Anime_Flux> Here's a vat of waterbears
[0:37:46] <%iaraCatunda> is woolie playing with no infra structures?
[0:37:46] <TheSandmanIsHere> almost like building connections is a theme of the game
[0:37:47] <%Takreth> "So I was building off-stream"
[0:37:48] <SoySocks> it's almost as if well-planned infrastructure and logistics is amazing. just like the postal service
[0:37:50] <marvel877> From "DROP YOUR SHIELD" to "BUILD YOUR ROAD"
[0:37:50] <%honeyman18> Considering hes been grabbed by every ghost since he started it should be fun.
[0:37:50] <%crimsonharvest> oh lord look at this Karen supreme
[0:37:51] <seycheles> of big strength
[0:37:52] <%Wurmspawn> It's almost like Infrastructure should be important or something.
[0:37:52] <HeroToxiko> Everyone i've seen brute force quit from burnout because nothing was built LUL
[0:37:54] <$eskerpole> Are you using the new exo?
[0:37:55] <NotHereToStream> A
[0:37:57] <Mendin> She saw it in the Stars
[0:37:57] <corpsegoo> I absolutely brute forced 90% of my travel before I connected online and decided to start building shit
[0:37:59] <%Ascethetic> "medicinal use"
[0:37:59] <purple_bagel> I thought ziplines had to be built like bridges so i never used them
[0:38:00] <%Wrashis> Wrashis subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 28 months! Pat. This is subscriber-man. Have you ever thought of how subscriptions release oxytocin for both the suibsciber and the subscibee? Keep on keeping on.

[0:43:01] <+wynnewake> The Mama storyline is peak Kojima "this is just bullshit magic"
[0:43:02] <Delenay> that sentence was dumb
[0:43:03] <+J_Papa> Wonder if you can take the body to a hotspring
[0:43:06] <%GarbageNirvana> So why did everyone decide to go with the Egyptian terminology
[0:43:06] <TheSandmanIsHere> @machshop yeah I'd be much happier to open up the door for 2Booty than ReedAss
[0:43:07] <+Mistheart101> pat blow your nose holy shit
[0:43:08] <%Doomcoder> remember kids, always ask for the consent of someone's soul before S-Ranking their bodty
[0:43:09] <+TheRealMasterof7s> DELIVER THIS CORPSE
[0:43:10] <NotHereToStream> ka=soul ha=body egyptian bullshit
[0:43:10] <HeroToxiko> Yeah just give heartman the body that doesn't decompose teenHMM
[0:43:12] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> ka = soul, ha = body
[0:43:13] <+profanityincluded> scrotum lake Kreygasm
[0:43:14] <%GarbageNirvana> Like body and soul work just fine

[0:43:18] <xxafrodragonxx> <3
[0:43:26] <maxpasta> Heart man is just lonely and wants a girlfriend
[0:43:27] <%megabrogus> I dont know the story of the game up to this point so wtf are the sisters ka and ha
[0:43:31] <+TheSaintJohn> these terms hurt me in my ka
[0:43:33] <%Laecerelius> Ka-Man loves Ride with Norman Reedus!
[0:43:35] <Yimi1> @AngriestPat just had my engine stall on the highway and had to get a tow. how's your day going?
[0:43:37] <%Doomcoder> my ha is ready
[0:43:39] <Jontman42> So how sexist is this game when it comes to how Kojima usually is?
[0:43:39] <T_Sasquatch> this game talks alot about ka and ha but never me and hame
[0:43:42] <trueherobappo> @angriestpat So wait, Mama actually dead died really dead??

[0:44:03] <+Alec_The_Risktaker> Not really. She's whole again
[0:44:05] <+profanityincluded> Its fine
[0:44:05] <TheSandmanIsHere> IIRC this is simplified from actual ancient Egyptian soul anatomy beliefs
[0:44:06] <%Meow0369> @megabrogus Ka and Ha refer to soul and body, one of the twins soul is in the other twins body so now there's a Ha without a Ka but it's all weird
[0:44:08] <Mister_McDerp> they're one person apparently
[0:44:11] <%dekkitout> Wasn't there a trailer with a corpse shaped backpack?

[0:55:09] <%WheatlyXT> He was just testing the chat
[0:55:09] <%This_is_Marco> @AngriestPat have you ever slipped along a mountain but instead of sliding you land on the next landing and take a shitton of fall damage?

[0:55:14] <HoIlywood_SN> @AngriestPat "Sam, this is Die-Hardman, why are you going on ziplining adventures with Mamas corpse"
[0:55:19] <%SWFanatic> the most humble of men
[0:55:20] <suckasurprise> @Fenrirlives Yep, Reedus gives him a name once you reach a certain point in the game
[0:55:20] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Pobody's Nerfect
[0:55:22] <rytisone> Pat is not perfect? No way
[0:55:22] <TheSandmanIsHere> bet that you need to extend the network to heartman before you can build that zipline you're planning
[0:55:22] <+jake_protagonist> i miss my truck
[0:55:24] <%Divryne> Restart the game if you don't get an S rank.
[0:55:25] <user_naim> Is he going to Heartman?

[0:55:30] <%daveglhf> the corpse needed some fresh air
[0:55:31] <%Meow0369> my first death was falling off a mountain
[0:55:31] <%cureneckbeard> He fell off a cliff when I ran away from him!
[0:55:32] <+Mistheart101> and yet you were bragging about being declared the best death stranding player

[0:56:33] <+MajorCrasher> @crimsonharvest yes
[0:56:37] <blaggablag> Sometimes in the mountains you can see the strands doing landfall and it's pretty impressive. They go big poof when they touch the ground.

[1:28:57] <%Valdorick> HE'S GOT FIRE BEHIND HIM
[1:28:57] <zenith0111> HE GAVE A THUMBS UP EVEN THO HE'S DEAD
[1:28:58] <DocMadfox> Cheer500 I saw some people in a Discord I'm in complaining about how the Death Standing reviews don't tell you if the game's good or not because people are affraid to shit talk Kojima. Meanwhile I'm sitting here watching you deliver semen, deliver mail order condom brides, and truckin' just to go "Yeah I'll buy that when it's on PC." Also if no one told you yet, Ahsoka from Clone Wars got so popular because she grew as a character, then told the Jedi Council they were a bunch of cunts and left.
[1:28:59] <Habblewater> WAIT NO
[1:29:00] <%Laecerelius> He's a bad man!
[1:29:00] <stoccton> but he has a cool mask
[1:29:00] <%SlimeSlimeSlime> He looks less trustworthy when infront of FIRE
[1:29:00] <+Alec_The_Risktaker> you shouldn't. Je
[1:29:03] <T_Sasquatch> because he's black ?
[1:29:03] <blaggablag> What you don't trust the big dude with a BLACK SKULL FOR A FACE?

[1:29:15] <VigilantShield> that is the best
[1:29:15] <RC_S3kshun8> Isn't DieHard-man a repatriate?

[1:29:56] <squirtkitten> KEKW
[1:29:57] <TheSandmanIsHere> THE RIDE NEVER ENDS
[1:29:57] <%Nordguy> Reedus keeps hearting really weird tweets about him, he seems like a very cool fellow
[1:29:58] <+Alec_The_Risktaker> AS IF
[1:29:59] <%shootbang_exe> thermal pads are real good if you're willing to give up slots
[1:30:01] <RC_S3kshun8> @Meow0369 no idea. That's what someone had told me he wears a mask or some shit. lol Every time I see the mask I'm like wtf
[1:30:01] <+profanityincluded> F
[1:30:02] <blaggablag> Don't, it's a waste of batteries
[1:30:02] <%WheatlyXT> holy shit, this is fucking cool, it's like I'm on the Ride with Norman Reedus
[1:30:12] <eco419> :( mama
[1:30:13] <duskrush> Yeah, bring some spray. That snow will melt your container
[1:30:15] <blaggablag> On AMC?
[1:30:16] <mechengineers> your off to see the wizard
[1:30:16] <HyperBomb21> Nah the thermal pad is very good
[1:30:16] <zenith0111> THE THERMAL PADS ARE SO USEFUL PAT
[1:30:20] <Soul_Intern> FOOT GLOVES
[1:30:20] <+MazDoThing> This game is so stupid I love it but I could probably never play it
[1:30:21] <+wynnewake> @WheatlyXT AMC's Ride?
[1:30:23] <duskrush> Also some ropes
[1:30:27] <duskrush> bring rope
[1:30:28] <Draco_Renegade> Take alot of rope
[1:30:29] <tiaramaki> Ropes, too, maybe?
[1:30:31] <%Doomcoder> You see, Sam, it's a dangerous world out there full of evil BTs... but there's evil within... too
[1:30:31] <TheZearGuy> Almost half way done
[1:30:34] <waifoong98> oohh there is a bag now huh
[1:30:36] <%WheatlyXT> AMC's Ride with Norman Reedus
[1:30:37] <startstoprepeat> if you're using thermal pads, snow does way slower container damage
[1:30:37] <b1gboss007> terna
[1:30:37] <$onlypuppet> Take it all in, then break it down. And put it back together
[1:30:40] <Ipsenscastle> This feels so cool like I'm riding Norman Reedus
[1:30:42] <%This_is_Marco> fuck it take the whole thing
[1:30:45] <+wynnewake> I love AMC's Ride with Norman Reedus
[1:30:48] <+JacknZack27> I never found thermal pads that necessary. Just ate up my battery life
[1:30:50] <kazadog> actual ropes or just more cum?
[1:30:51] <tr00ly_> suck it
[1:30:51] <b1gboss007> termal pads give hoy extra battery
[1:30:53] <+orthodoxwaffle> prepare to lose all your shit
[1:30:56] <Mendin> Now call me crazy, b ut somehow I Dont think the game will end when you get to Edgge Knot
[1:30:57] <RC_S3kshun8> Is DOOMS every explained as to what the various levels are/do? I know Sam can sense, Fragile has instant transmission, and Higgs has..lots of cocaine, but does it ever progress?
[1:30:59] <blaggablag> I hate that chiral snow melts through your bag cover like it's made of wet tissue
[1:30:59] <b1gboss007> give you*
[1:31:00] <zenith0111> AMC'S Ride with Norman Reedus is actually a pretty chi show
[1:31:06] <ShichiNoBushi> Climbing Anchors have been "Lvl. 1" this entire game up to know. When do you get better ones?
[1:31:11] <+luketrapwalker> get your stupid fookin rope *in an irish accent*
[1:31:22] <Mendin> Boondock Strands
[1:31:24] <RC_S3kshun8> +1 for Ride with Norman Reedus, as a Motorcycle Rider, I dig it a lot
[1:31:26] <corpsegoo> lot of mountaineering for this segment, but it'll all eventually loop up
[1:31:36] <+orthodoxwaffle> I hate when Conan Obrien swoops in last minute and empties your inventory, the fuck
[1:31:37] <+luketrapwalker> @Mendin hell yeah
[1:31:39] <duskrush> Make one and pick up more at your destination. You can't build in an area with no chiral network connections anyway
[1:31:42] <+profanityincluded> and connect heartman?
[1:31:46] <MrKerb> Just beat DS a few days ago, now just connecting the map with ziplines
[1:31:52] <axivate_> @AngriestPat Are you looking for a D&D DM? I have 10+ years in the game and would be interested in running one for y'all :)

[1:32:30] <Cloontanglordo> uptime!
[1:32:33] <%SaiyanShoto> No roads no gods
[1:32:34] <%Doomcoder> NG+ is just turning off the spoiler structure prevention
[1:32:35] <Mendin> @squirtkitten He's hiking across america, boots get worndown and you kinda need footwear
[1:32:37] <%Soulbishop> Remember when Pat Rucked to death?
[1:32:43] <Cloontanglordo> any story shit?
[1:32:43] <jeiben> OF COURSE
[1:32:44] <+ClaudeMcGarren> @warmy54 antimatter bomb all the way back down the mountain
[1:32:52] <+Woronov> to go up the other mountain
[1:32:53] <+D00msDayDan> @J_Papa chiral matter that came from the beach is in the atmosphere and that makes the weather fucky
[1:33:05] <ThDark> Why does his backpack look.. thicker than usual? Don't think I've seen that upgrade
[1:33:05] <zecht89> oh that safehouse is mine
[1:33:08] <duskrush> Hey pat you see that peak to your right? put one up there when you get the chance
[1:33:13] <%jcenderion> @AngriestPat PAT, IT'S TIME, TO BLOW
[1:33:13] <jasnake> Should have put it on top of the house
[1:33:16] <corpsegoo> timefall is just environmental pollution caused by the introductions of chiral matter into the world which was caused by the stranding
[1:33:22] <%Floorislava> macaw1 macaw2
[1:33:27] <Cloontanglordo> @jeiben could you be a bit specific?
[1:33:28] <%SaiyanShoto> SaiyanShoto subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 2 month streak! A month closer to my stream baby!
[1:33:28] <Bigbossman91> @jasnake you can't put one there
[1:33:30] <%wannabemoogle> That sucks
[1:33:33] <squirtkitten> @Mendin I managed to do the game just by restocking after each delivery
[1:33:35] <suckasurprise> @Floorislava macaw1 macaw2
[1:33:36] <+antdang> can any regulars in the stream tell me if Pat canceled his FF7 play through?
[1:33:43] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> weee
[1:33:47] <warmy54> i don't know if you will read this but thx pat you are the only reason why i can stand working a night late (i'm from EU)
[1:33:48] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Early Strem are better
[1:33:49] <jeiben> @Cloontanglordo there is a place that is shaped like heartmans hearth
[1:34:00] <Cloontanglordo> o-oh
[1:34:01] <+antdang> Got it. Fair enough.
[1:34:01] <waifoong98> infinite onhold Kappa
[1:34:05] <%Anime_Flux> get fucked, Clumbo
[1:34:06] <%wannabemoogle> Gotta build roads and be truckin
[1:34:07] <%Meow0369> 22 years old
[1:34:08] <%Alpha8087> I am excited for return of Clumbo when this is done
[1:34:10] <duskrush> Eh, you got time. FF7 Remake is still months out
[1:34:11] <ovan20> offended roo4
[1:34:12] <+Yellowrobe> HOTNESS
[1:34:13] <+Nomicro4u> TOO OLD
[1:34:15] <%nofestu2> I can't believe Pat hates ff7
[1:34:16] <%dekkitout> "Old and busted, new hotness~"
[1:34:16] <%Valdorick> It will also be put on Hold while the we do a Let Watch of Ride with Norman Reedus.
[1:34:18] <Namillus> This is the new hotness until FF7 becomes the New Hotness
[1:34:21] <%Doomcoder> looking forward to the Death Stranding remake in 2040
[1:34:21] <+Audega> @AngriestPat Depending on the length of your streams and how efficient you are, you could finish this game next stream
[1:34:21] <%GeneralSCPatton> FF7 DOESN'T HAVE ROADS AND ZIPLINES
[1:34:21] <arkv01> ff7 on hold... until march Kappa
[1:34:23] <peachy996> Calling it low key Old and Busted
[1:34:23] <+netrac> 00:27 here... early
[1:34:24] <b1gboss007> death stranding better than ff7 confirmed
[1:34:24] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> ff7 is legal
[1:34:24] <+orthodoxwaffle> "march" lol
[1:34:29] <+Yellowrobe> Death Stranding >>>>> ff7
[1:34:30] <+orthodoxwaffle> you're almost done dingdong
[1:34:30] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Cant wait till March OMG Kreygasm
[1:34:39] <Soul_Intern> Lets get some PPP's
[1:34:42] <arkv01> ff7 fucks but only when its sunny
[1:34:47] <T_Sasquatch> ff7 is a year older than me LUL
[1:34:49] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat This game keeps mentioning the Dinosaurs and extinctions. Is it saying Mass Extinction Events like the Permian Extinction and so on were super natural events. Was the Dinosaurs' extinction ALSO a Death Stranding?
[1:34:51] <ChrisM341> FF7 is Old and Busted confirmed by Pat
[1:34:54] <duskrush> You won't be able to build much between your first stop at the geologist and heartman's lab
[1:34:55] <TheSandmanIsHere> @orthodoxwaffle didn't specify which march!
[1:34:55] <MrKerb> Try doctor
[1:34:56] <+antdang> That's the first time Pat has responded to something I posted in the chat and I embarrassed to admit it feels special.
[1:34:58] <%MalekDracarus> Will Cyberpunk be happening in april?
[1:35:00] <agumon9000> @AngriestPat Pat that cutscene with Sam DJing Heartman's record and the dead Heartman gives you a thumbs up is the best fucking thing ever
[1:35:06] <Soul_Intern> @ScreamLord Yes.
[1:35:06] <%Doomcoder> @ScreamLord I guarantee you it wasn't an asteroid, it was a voidout
[1:35:06] <rytisone> FF7 Remake, Doom Eternal and Half Life Alyx all in march
[1:35:19] <jetvillain> Chimera Ants
[1:35:21] <%Meow0369> No
[1:35:23] <%cureneckbeard> dinosaur stranding
[1:35:27] <Mister_McDerp> the asteroid was a ghost
[1:35:27] <+Nomicro4u> DINO BTS
[1:35:28] <mr_gunn> Chimera ants?
[1:35:28] <Soul_Intern> IT WAS GHOSTS MAN
[1:35:28] <jacknerik> wait WHAT PogChamp
[1:35:29] <%Deadpal> yes
[1:35:31] <%crimsonharvest> they're tryign to say the asteroid was a BT taht's stupid
[1:35:31] <%cureneckbeard> first impact
[1:35:33] <reonome> aw shit
[1:35:33] <duskrush> There was a velociraptor delivering pizzas
[1:35:34] <%megabrogus> dinosaurs on the beach
[1:35:35] <%wannabemoogle> And Jesus was a repatriot
[1:35:36] <DocMadfox> Probably
[1:35:36] <+Nomicro4u> DINO BTS CONFIRMED
[1:35:36] <%dekkitout> Dino-ghosts sound kick ass
[1:35:37] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> that wouls be cool
[1:35:38] <%Deadpal> yes.
[1:35:39] <%cureneckbeard> so where are the dinosaur ghost
[1:35:40] <Dakuu75> Sup road-gang, how's it truckin~
[1:35:40] <%chiluzza> im gonna call it now the dinosaurs were an advanced civilization
[1:35:41] <NotHereToStream> dino voidout
[1:35:41] <+machshop> no, the asteroid CAUSED the stranding, and then voidouts came after
[1:35:42] <%Meow0369> You're half right
[1:35:42] <%BallerSwagBro9k> GHOST KILLED JKF
[1:35:43] <arkv01> KOJIMA SCIENCE
[1:35:43] <%crimsonharvest> we FOUND the asteroid's iron
[1:35:44] <b1gboss007> why not both
[1:35:47] <ShichiNoBushi> I hope there will be BT-rexes.
[1:35:48] <+boki_86> so it is Neon Genesis Evangelion all over
[1:35:48] <$LocDogX86X> I see
[1:35:49] <reonome> jesus was a repariate PogChamp
[1:35:49] <AMaidIndeed> So Dino's have souls then?
[1:35:50] <Mendin> The Astral Plane absorbing all life on Earth is a Death Stranding, the Chimeras are BTs
[1:35:50] <T_Sasquatch> Yes but no
[1:35:50] <%Meow0369> The asteroid was real, it WAS the stranding
[1:35:50] <+profanityincluded> its so cool tho
[1:35:50] <%J_Papa> Were the dinosaurs bad at sneaking past BTs too?
[1:35:51] <%LaughingCatt> well, there is an impact crater...
[1:35:51] <%cureneckbeard> and that's why cats evolved the ability to see ghosts.
[1:35:52] <+orthodoxwaffle> Plesiosaur Stranding
[1:35:52] <jasnake> Thank you Kojima
[1:35:54] <ChrisM341> Death Stranding killed Jesus
[1:35:54] <agumon9000> @AngriestPat Pat...You see how small humans are and how much one antimatter a human BT brings...IMAGINE A FUCKING DIONSUAR
[1:35:55] <Aruvella> ...so why aren't there dinosaur BTs?
[1:35:55] <+BringBackSempai> but you wouldn't have meteorite material left over
[1:35:57] <zenith0111> ONE DOESN'T STOP THE OTHER
[1:35:58] <ostermox> @AngriestPat Hey Pat, wassup?
[1:35:58] <pidgeling> apparently the asteroid traveled from the top of the atmosphere to the ground in less than 5 seconds
[1:36:01] <+orthodoxwaffle> they're the goo
[1:36:01] <peachy996> What were the other MEEs?
[1:36:02] <42nfl19> so the BTs are a dinosaur?
[1:36:03] <worldbrand> it wouldnt blast shit into the atmosphere and coat the earth in layers of dust though
[1:36:04] <xenoboost> time to get getter energy involved
[1:36:05] <%Meow0369> the death stranding is a name FOR the extinctions, the asteroid is real @AngriestPat
[1:36:07] <duskrush> SAM PTERODACTYL BRIDGES
[1:36:10] <+Punchasaur> Code Talker mentioned dinosaurs when talking about the WOLBACHIA
[1:36:11] <kazadog> so youre trying to stop third impact?
[1:36:15] <JimJamr> So where there Dinosaur BT"s?
[1:36:16] <Dakuu75> oh shit, we traded our roads for zip-lines, lol
[1:36:17] <rytisone> Once there was an explosion, that killed dinosaurs
[1:36:18] <%cureneckbeard> so all the oil is BTs
[1:36:19] <%AtisutoCurry> hmmm
[1:36:19] <Gruntini> bruh wtf
[1:36:19] <Mister_McDerp> a titanosaur voidout would be HUGE
[1:36:21] <Nina96> @AngriestPat so whats your score of this game?
[1:36:21] <Teyaric> 3rd impact already HAPPENED
[1:36:22] <HoIlywood_SN> @AngriestPat is Godzilla a Dino BT?
[1:36:23] <uncledoodsauce> ja rule is in the game pat
[1:36:24] <+orthodoxwaffle> CAW CAW HIS NAME IS LOU MOTHERFUCKERS
[1:36:25] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> T REX NUKES
[1:36:28] <Teyaric> We're on the SIXTH in this game
[1:36:28] <duskrush> The BT-Rex
[1:36:29] <+paladinstarbuster> For those whos say we found iron they also found metal in the voidouts
[1:36:30] <Aruvella> Does this mean all the Ice Age mammals that died are BTs too?
[1:36:30] <%Alpha8087> Theory Proven, Dinosaurs made chiral technology
[1:36:31] <+antdang> Tit-an-saur?
[1:36:32] <redrins> wait then why arent random animals causing voidouts
[1:36:33] <suckasurprise> @uncledoodsauce LUL
[1:36:36] <reonome> man that heart lake LUL
[1:36:38] <Aruvella> Wooly Mammoth BTS?
[1:36:39] <kazadog> @Teyaric oof big impacts
[1:36:40] <lordsdb> That lakes a heart
[1:36:41] <TheSandmanIsHere> Nukasaurus
[1:36:44] <VigilantShield> would physical size effect the size of the void out?
[1:36:46] <%crimsonharvest> if it was a voidout why was there no chiral crystal in the sediment
[1:36:48] <%ThatOneGuyYouSaw> how doe she pay for the upkeep on that house?
[1:36:50] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> Smart
[1:36:51] <+Punchasaur> GHOSTZILLA???
[1:36:52] <%PkSilent01> YO Dinosaur BTs
[1:36:53] <Teyaric> Just wait till we hear about "EE"s.
[1:36:53] <+D00msDayDan> when's the prequel where your bridge babies are bridge eggs
[1:36:55] <%Doomcoder> @VigilantShield presumably, it's antimatter
[1:36:56] <%Strider222> but why would a dinosaur create a voidout? only humans have a beach and can therefore create a voidout. animals dont have beaches and cant voidout
[1:36:57] <+orthodoxwaffle> @VigilantShield yes
[1:36:58] <%GeneralSCPatton> @angriestpat But a voidout would not scatter a layer of iridium across the whole Earth. The K-T Boundary is fucking rad.
[1:36:58] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> LUL
[1:36:59] <duskrush> Those amazing ladders
[1:37:00] <%daveglhf> i wonder how big the dinosaur monsters cans were
[1:37:00] <%Deadpal> lmfao
[1:37:02] <Soul_Intern> @VigilantShield Not really clear on that
[1:37:03] <NotHereToStream> smart ladder placement if you ask me
[1:37:03] <%Animorphimagi> why do Dinosaurs have Beaches?
[1:37:03] <squirtkitten> Hideo 'Subly is for cowards" Kojima
[1:37:04] <%This_is_Marco> troll ladders LUL
[1:37:05] <%Deadpal> GOOD LADDER GIVE IT A THUMBS UP
[1:37:06] <%dekkitout> Come to think of it, there was a Godzilla movie where Godzilla was a mass amalgamation of dead WWII soldiers
[1:37:07] <ChrisM341> Dinosaurs died because they couldn't watch Ride with Norman Reedus on AMC
[1:37:07] <%Doomcoder> the K-T Boundary is chiralium
[1:37:09] <Draco_Renegade> So are there any animal BT's?
[1:37:12] <OvaltineDream> because nobody would stop him
[1:37:15] <rytisone> yolo ladders
[1:37:17] <reonome> DEW IT
[1:37:18] <Soul_Intern> HISTORY AND SHIT
[1:37:18] <Aruvella> @GeneralSCPatton Unless it took place on a site of radioactive material.
[1:37:19] <$Starwarp08> Cheer100 looks like the tank woolie posed with that he mentioned on last weeks podcast was a Patton
[1:37:22] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat And even if the size of the animal doesn't matter, the Dinosaurs wouldn't be able to figure out how to mitigate the Voidouts and it would have just been a chain reaction
[1:37:24] <Mister_McDerp> dinosaurs have souls confirmed
[1:37:25] <duskrush> You can do it Pat! Stay determined!
[1:37:25] <Kongro_> stop clapping pat
[1:37:26] <CatmanIX> I'm still hung up on the NEANDERTHALS in NORTH AMERICA from last stream
[1:37:27] <%crimsonharvest> if they say they found chiral crystals in fossils i'm gonna shit my ass
[1:37:27] <Mendin> Schlepp that nuke
[1:37:28] <zenith0111> Animals have been showed MULTIPLE TIMES on the beach CHAT
[1:37:28] <+DatGuyJimbo> @angriestpat Make sure you read emails when they come for new peppers or their rep won't increase
[1:37:34] <Soul_Intern> Ghost AIDS
[1:37:38] <Kongro_> Clap more Pat
[1:37:39] <%Wurmspawn> Sooo, are there animal BT's? Are they the boss battles that Pat's been doing? Because that implies that animals are supposed to have souls too and there should be TONS more animal BTs then humanoid BTs.
[1:37:39] <aerizn> GIANT WHALES
[1:37:39] <+antdang> Clap even harder
[1:37:39] <waifoong98> heh not uranium
[1:37:40] <squirtkitten> Tutorial-Explainman
[1:37:41] <tiaramaki> Clap even more

[1:37:47] <+orthodoxwaffle> CLAP THEM DINO GOO CHEEKS
[1:37:48] <OldManDeckardCain> THIS IS NOT A PLANE PAT
[1:37:48] <riyokuno> STOP
[1:37:48] <Nina96> @AngriestPat would you ever do a titan fall 2 stream?
[1:37:52] <+antdang> and your palms bleed
[1:37:57] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> YEYEYEYEYE
[1:37:57] <reonome> welcome back heartman
[1:37:58] <%Meow0369> Pat the death stranding is just the word they give extinction events, voidouts and BTs are the latest extinction event, the meteor was 100 percent a real thing
[1:37:58] <rytisone> He is right there
[1:38:02] <+Punchasaur> Clap more
[1:38:02] <%honeyman18> Scrub his balls clean
[1:38:05] <peachy996> I love how sus Die Hardman looks behind Heartman
[1:38:09] <%J_Papa> Wait over there while Heartman talks, Die Hardman
[1:38:14] <Aruvella> What.
[1:38:14] <Delenay> big five?
[1:38:16] <+TheBigO75> Shut up
[1:38:16] <%Doomcoder> @Meow0369 there were historical BTs, according to that caveman painting dolphin

[1:38:28] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @AngriestPat But he correlated extinction level events, which arent just only astroids. They include lethal algae blooms, severe lack of oxygen, and ice ages
[1:38:28] <%Meow0369> @Doomcoder There were, but they weren't the apocalypse
[1:38:30] <%GeneralSCPatton> GHOSTASAURUS REX

[1:49:26] <uncledoodsauce> DSP failed this delivery a thousand times. Kappa
[1:49:34] <%crimsonharvest> theres probably ghosts in the easy path
[1:49:36] <%Takreth> Is this packet loss
[1:49:39] <waifoong98> through BT zone probably
[1:49:40] <R3c0n31> i wonder how many ghosts are on that path
[1:49:41] <Mendin> Stumbo-Patman
[1:49:44] <Delenay> did he drop the bomb?
[1:49:44] <%arsonistdaria> Should just go set off the nuke right outside Heartman's house
[1:49:45] <%shootbang_exe> btw pat your zipline is gone
[1:49:45] <+NitronStreams> You got all the groceries up stairs but one of the bags ripped
[1:49:45] <TheSandmanIsHere> stay on this side of the mountain
[1:49:48] <deviate_dv8> "I didn't die you guys! I failed! Its different!"
[1:49:49] <%SWFanatic> go through the mines of moria
[1:49:53] <%Faustgesicht> So what does tar represent in this game?
[1:49:54] <OldManDeckardCain> no consequences? what is this, a david cage game?
[1:49:54] <marvel877> @uncledoodsauce is there a compilation somewhere yet?
[1:49:55] <Guardiansaiyan> @R3c0n31 all of them
[1:49:55] <Habblewater> Zipline destroyed
[1:49:57] <%J_Papa> That cargo was called by its destiny
[1:50:00] <%thenumber5point5> I got plenty of grenades I think that is a heavy BT area
[1:50:06] <Habblewater> I'm going Ghost
[1:50:06] <+robert_edwards> you could try just walking, set up ziplines later?
[1:50:08] <%Anime_Flux> apatBig fuckies
[1:50:08] <zenith0111> PAT YOU'RE TERRIBLE AT PLOTTING COURSES
[1:50:14] <duskrush> You don't have to go through the ghost place if you just stay on the top of the ridge
[1:50:15] <R3c0n31> @Guardiansaiyan This is the Way
[1:50:22] <Frozenflame01> I think you can do the same way you just need to remember to crouch
[1:50:23] <ChrisM341> The mountain is a boss battle
[1:50:24] <$onlypuppet> Foresight usually just comes with experience
[1:50:24] <marshmallowowl> ***
[1:50:33] <TheSandmanIsHere> check the map, you can run down the central bowl
[1:50:33] <eco419> Pat is the top DS player on here
[1:50:37] <Goergorion> why is the bomb on top of everything else?!?
[1:50:40] <OldManDeckardCain> just use a horse, it's the only way to skyrim the mountain Kappa
[1:50:44] <Guardiansaiyan> @R3c0n31 do you know da wae???
[1:50:46] <shiny_prinny> realistically in this setting they should need masks, but they probably want to show the characters' faces
[1:50:46] <+orthodoxwaffle> omg
[1:50:52] <+orthodoxwaffle> absolute yahoo
[1:50:53] <%WhereIsWill> time for BT land
[1:50:53] <+Yellowrobe> does he not have climbing anchors?
[1:50:54] <%rumtumtugnutz> ballsack horseman
[1:50:55] <Mendin> yeah why isn't the bomb in the slipcover
[1:50:58] <%Doomcoder> is that noise BTs singing, or the Odradrek?
[1:51:00] <Ipsenscastle> how come you guys all know what DSP did when by all accounts hes an unwatchable horrible freakazoid
[1:51:01] <SpaceGuntank> do BTs make marks in the snow?
[1:51:02] <ScreamLord> Someone built a Zipline Network that totally bypassed this mountain...or a similar one
[1:51:03] <+orthodoxwaffle> sprint pat
[1:51:11] <%Anime_Flux> Bomb disliked that.
[1:51:11] <Ashenik1> Hi first timeer o/. Is pat good to listen to in the background if I want to do my work ro play some onbrainer ? :*

[1:51:17] <Guardiansaiyan> @SpaceGuntank snow angels!
[1:51:18] <%thenumber5point5> his hands are climbing anchors
[1:51:21] <Ipsenscastle> *always, not all
[1:51:22] <waifoong98> @OldManDeckardCain all he needs to do is press "~" then type "noclip" Kappa
[1:51:27] <%rumtumtugnutz> horsesack ballman
[1:51:28] <suckasurprise> @Ashenik1 He's pretty good for that
[1:51:35] <+Punchasaur> Time for some ghost recon UnSane
[1:51:40] <%Meow0369> pat you don't need to bola them to melee kill just crouch walk to them
[1:51:44] <reonome> the cold never bothered me anyway
[1:51:44] <DocMadfox> Piss on it!
[1:51:48] <rytisone> winter is coming
[1:51:49] <Delenay> that wall looked man made on the left
[1:51:52] <%Alpha8087> SNOW SPOOKS
[1:51:53] <%rumtumtugnutz> this Jenga reboot is hard to follow

[1:52:00] <%Valdorick> Ah look, its the Donnor Party Voidout
[1:52:03] <Gruntini> Piss off ghosts!
[1:52:03] <Zaphire_Saucypants> just got on, what'd I miss?
[1:52:03] <%crimsonharvest> a lot of people died crossing these mountains on foot in the 1700 and 1800s
[1:52:05] <Delenay> are there structures up here?
[1:52:06] <%thenumber5point5> the bola makes it alot safer
[1:52:07] <Ashenik1> @suckasurprise thx :>
[1:52:10] <%Anime_Flux> daaamn
[1:52:13] <+luketrapwalker> How does that work on BT?
[1:52:14] <Tha_Mik> snip
[1:52:14] <duskrush> I used this valley as a shortcut back to Heartman's lab from a different place. Once the ziplines are up it isn't a problem
[1:52:17] <$NocturneNovember> wait, he got a like from a BT
[1:52:17] <%Doomcoder> is there really no consequence for assassinating all the ghosts?
[1:52:24] <R3c0n31> man this trip destroys your cargo, especially through the ghosts
[1:52:28] <ThDark> @Delenay There are old city structures in the mountains, yes
[1:52:32] <%Deft_Thought> The BT... gave you a like?
[1:52:32] <$onlypuppet> Do you remember the first time you died?
[1:52:34] <CatmanIX> the BTs love it
[1:52:34] <%This_is_Marco> anyone ever encounter the baby + parent BT combo
[1:52:37] <KaliasTV> Did that just say they got a like from a BT
[1:52:43] <%Anime_Flux> oof
[1:52:44] <Habblewater> yikes
[1:52:44] <%megabrogus> you can take these guys out thats sick
[1:52:47] <Mendin> yeah you set them freeeee
[1:52:47] <herfaintsmile> uh oh
[1:52:48] <NeroInfinite> IT's giga fucked
[1:52:49] <SpaceGuntank> holy shit
[1:52:50] <Guardiansaiyan> @Deft_Thought don't be a BT-ist
[1:52:51] <duskrush> Yeah...
[1:52:51] <kazadog> RIP
[1:52:55] <startstoprepeat> i'm telling you, thermal pads
[1:52:55] <R3c0n31> harder the wind/snow the worse it gets
[1:52:56] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> fug
[1:52:57] <%Alpha8087> It seems like they are trapped here and Sams cutting the tether keeping them here? I could be way freakin wrong but thats what it feels like.
[1:52:57] <waifoong98> quick, use curaga Kappa
[1:53:01] <Kongro_> Yeah timefall snow is bad
[1:53:06] <jacknerik> @Doomcoder given the fact they actualy give you likes it's implied that it's encouraged
[1:53:06] <+Edrem> repair spray barely works in rain
[1:53:07] <%Anime_Flux> Hose them in Axe body spray
[1:53:09] <shiny_prinny> i guess the downside would be letting your cargo deteriorate in the timefall if you try to kill everything
[1:53:14] <%Deft_Thought> @Guardiansaiyan Never met a BT I've liked >:(
[1:53:19] <OldManDeckardCain> if only donald would use his fucking heal
[1:53:21] <ChrisM341> AXE CARGO SPRAY
[1:53:24] <Guardiansaiyan> @Deft_Thought BRO
[1:53:27] <%mield916> does he still have the bomb? been in class
[1:53:28] <ThDark> The BTs are STRANDED and you are returning them to where they belong by severing the strand
[1:53:29] <Mendin> this is the death stranding after all, not the death visiting on vacation

[1:57:37] <Guardiansaiyan> Beam me up Scotty!
[1:57:39] <%Laecerelius> Star Trekman
[1:57:40] <Ipsenscastle> Crazy Talk made me believe magic is real

[1:57:56] <$onlypuppet> That’s true
[1:57:57] <%thenumber5point5> Ski Free yeti now tackles you from out of no where
[1:57:58] <Habblewater> magic and shit
[1:57:58] <+fingalights> Probably never will
[1:57:59] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Its an awesome game
[1:58:00] <herfaintsmile> was dooms ever explained
[1:58:01] <+Punchasaur> At this point pat could just say “I’m mortal” and crazy talk will activate
[1:58:05] <+Edrem> DOOMS is nanomachines KAppa
[1:58:06] <%mield916> they'll explain in chapter 13
[1:58:07] <rytisone> Picard out
[1:58:07] <%Meow0369> I think dooms gets explained either at the literal end of the game or not at all
[1:58:08] <%crimsonharvest> he didnt even talk shit about the condition
[1:58:13] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> ghost STDs
[1:58:14] <+Zutrax> I beat the game, got the platinum trophy, and read every log and I STILL dont know what DOOMs is.
[1:58:15] <+Yellowrobe> They give you written stuff that explains it some earlier too
[1:58:17] <%Anime_Flux> Engage!
[1:58:19] <duskrush> @AngriestPat What happens if you kill a MULE with a real gun?
[1:58:20] <CatmanIX> @AngriestPat DOOMs is basically an allergic reaction to chiral shit as far as i understand
[1:58:21] <Gruntini> DAB
[1:58:22] <+Nomicro4u> HIS FADCE
[1:58:26] <Tha_Mik> DAB
[1:58:26] <Kiraklene> Sick!!!
[1:58:26] <%nofestu2> apatDab
[1:58:27] <+Nomicro4u> IS COVERED IN TIME SNOW
[1:58:27] <reonome> WHY
[1:58:28] <@commanderclaw> There's snow on his fucking face man
[1:58:31] <%Animorphimagi> high chirellium contamination gives you DOOMS
[1:58:31] <+Godjaw> Chiral contamination causes suicidal tendencies? Wut
[1:58:31] <thetruenicster> sam has snow on his face
[1:58:32] <%Ner234> STOP
[1:58:32] <shiny_prinny> it really does get worse every time
[1:58:33] <+luketrapwalker> clip that dance pls
[1:58:35] <corpsegoo> dooms it's basically chiral toxicity + the allergy
[1:58:36] <%Laecerelius> @AngriestPat Remember that time Data screamed at his cat so hard it exploded?
[1:58:37] <%Piemen99> apatDab apatDab apatDab apatDab apatDab apatDab
[1:58:38] <Habblewater> DOOMS are people allergic to Chiral apparently
[1:58:39] <%GeneralSCPatton> With those Wolverine claws, you better believe he's the best at what he does
[1:58:39] <thetruenicster> shouldnt he be old as shit now
[1:58:40] <TheZearGuy> I assume DOOMS is high affinity to beaches
[1:58:40] <+profanityincluded> its frostbite
[1:58:41] <Gruntini> Chiral Cummies
[1:58:41] <@commanderclaw> AMERICA
[1:58:43] <aerizn> sam is covered in ghost jizz
[1:58:46] <VigilantShield> and the hate is totally fine
[1:58:46] <Delenay> if dooms makes you suicidal, maybe thats why the normal is doing this suicidal porting?
[1:58:47] <%Alpha8087> We need an emote with Pat crossing his arms crossed all cool
[1:58:50] <%J_Papa> Try some thermal pads
[1:58:53] <NeroInfinite> It's like he wlaked intoa bukkae

[1:59:53] <Bigbossman91> @thetruenicster yeah offscreeen
[1:59:55] <rytisone> this is some mass effect shit
[1:59:55] <VigilantShield> 5 bucks says its not a fossil beach and is instead something far worse
[1:59:57] <%thenumber5point5> I think there was some lore thing that time fall doesnt do the long term damage to sam like it does others due to him being a repatriate

[2:18:56] <vicious_rage> ok was gonna say, cutscenes alone...
[2:19:03] <Cloontanglordo> @Punchasaur yes
[2:19:13] <pufferfishbones> Don't bully Heartman that's the guy who directed Drive
[2:19:14] <Zaphire_Saucypants> hah
[2:19:16] <@commanderclaw> PANIC
[2:19:16] <%Anime_Flux> uh oh

[2:19:22] <+profanityincluded> LUL
[2:19:22] <%Alpha8087> Can you disassemble some on the map?
[2:19:23] <hntronium> oh yes
[2:19:24] <%Maids4lyfe> you have to connect the last stations for ziplines
[2:19:26] <%Alpha8087> I mean less used ones
[2:19:26] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> make em count
[2:19:28] <ThDark> Wow, you really do build a LOT of ziplines
[2:19:30] <corpsegoo> nah you can't build things too close to other buildings
[2:19:33] <+ClaudeMcGarren> @pufferfishbones no shit really thats him?
[2:19:38] <pufferfishbones> yup!
[2:19:38] <Zaphire_Saucypants> you're gonna need more zipline
[2:19:40] <%WhereIsWill> Zip Lineman
[2:19:44] <+Punchasaur> @vixenpunch Sam is a better dad
[2:19:45] <%DrWolpertinger> it's ok Pat. just build a mailbox full of carriers and slide down the last slope
[2:19:50] <%Anime_Flux> Infinite Zipline Works
[2:19:51] <pufferfishbones> He doesn't voice himself though but English isn't his native.
[2:19:52] <Habblewater> There's a limit on ziplines?
[2:19:57] <%SWFanatic> Pat Vs Ziplines - This is a battle I Must win
[2:20:00] <pufferfishbones> Neon Demon too.
[2:20:02] <%Maids4lyfe> yes
[2:20:03] <$NocturneNovember> Based on bandwidth, yes
[2:20:05] <$onlypuppet> I am literally too autistic for this. Whatever “this” is
[2:20:07] <%Maids4lyfe> ziplines take up bandwidth
[2:20:09] <Cloontanglordo> @pufferfishbones for deadman?
[2:20:10] <%Doomcoder> I am the Box of my Parcels
[2:20:10] <ElenaManetta> Watching a character run through snow is physically exhausting
[2:20:11] <Zaphire_Saucypants> also...have you found the prepper near the Spiritualist?
[2:20:15] <%Keyd00d> How I learned to ignore everything and ho back to the bomb
[2:20:15] <%Maids4lyfe> you can't build them if you don't have the coverage
[2:20:21] <ShichiNoBushi> More deliveries = more bandwidth = more ziplines
[2:20:23] <%DrWolpertinger> don't blow up
[2:20:25] <InXplotch> so you really tried out league earlier today?
[2:20:26] <Cloontanglordo> i though del toro spoke fluent engrish
[2:20:29] <%SWFanatic> ClompOnSnow Man
[2:20:33] <%PlainSimpleTailor> What's the upper limit on Zips
[2:20:33] <+ClaudeMcGarren> @pufferfishbones thats dope love drive so much that put me on to gosling
[2:20:33] <corpsegoo> pat has found the first prepper the first prepper just doesn't want to be friends rn
[2:20:36] <%vixenpunch> Imagine being a prepper in this universe and being vindicated.
[2:20:37] <zenith0111> @habblewater Bandwidth is essentially your point total and each building takes more points to build
[2:20:38] <pufferfishbones> Heartman is the director of drive. Del Toro is Dead Man. Refn is his name.
[2:20:41] <%thenumber5point5> @mield916 if he keep doing the story stuff should hit the start of endgame dont you thibk
[2:20:47] <ItsAGundamu> STAHP
[2:20:48] <Zaphire_Saucypants> @corpsegoo aight
[2:20:54] <+MazDoThing> Remember how shiny and new his pack was at the start of the night?
[2:20:54] <%Maids4lyfe> @Cloontanglordo he can, but his voice isn't good for acting
[2:21:07] <InXplotch> what did you think?
[2:21:16] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> stop while you can
[2:21:20] <%Meow0369> Who made it
[2:21:25] <%Maids4lyfe> give him likes
[2:21:25] <+ClaudeMcGarren> @InXplotch he said earlier a more stressful version of hots
[2:21:25] <+D00msDayDan> and unlike DbD, league has TOXICITY
[2:21:25] <%theAncopro> spam some likes
[2:21:26] <ItsAGundamu> Don't go down this rabbit hole pat
[2:21:28] <%GunToad> GIVE THAT MAN LIKES

[2:21:40] <%theAncopro> YEYE
[2:21:41] <peachy996> patience
[2:21:42] <%vixenpunch> League is good, the new champion is off the walls crazy though
[2:21:43] <VigilantShield> damn
[2:21:45] <pufferfishbones> SMASH THAT
[2:21:47] <zenith0111> I built Ziplines around the whole map using only 20 k bandwidth rmzNOM
[2:21:47] <Mendin> DbD has big toxicity but it's all on their forums and discord
[2:21:47] <themisticmist2000> R I P P P P
[2:21:49] <%cache_22> Smash that like button.
[2:21:49] <$onlypuppet> PrideLionChomp
[2:21:50] <Cloontanglordo> @Maids4lyfe ahhh, a shame, i personally wouldnt have minded but its humble of him to let someone else do it, besides hes probably busy.
[2:21:52] <%DrWolpertinger> would Pat play DotA?
[2:21:53] <%theAncopro> number go UPP
[2:21:57] <+NitronStreams> Rip Vodman
[2:22:04] <InXplotch> hots does cover you a lot with its shared xp, so I get that
[2:22:05] <KaliasTV> Like Subscribeman
[2:22:09] <corpsegoo> tbh given the rate of the game, it's definitely not getting finished tonight, but also I think the sheer length of the end game stuff is going to end up two streams alone
[2:22:10] <Bigbossman91> Vods fine stop lying chat
[2:22:12] <%pepzi_boyz> if timefall is such a big problem why don't people just build tunnels that connect to each other
[2:22:13] <herfaintsmile> past vod's been fine
[2:22:14] <ElenaManetta> its so nice feeling to compliment total strangers you'll never meet. like thanks man, you made my game experience better
[2:22:15] <b1gboss007> that one is also in My game
[2:22:17] <%vixenpunch> The champion they just annouced is missing an entire ability, and they dont gain skillpoints upon levelup
[2:22:18] <%SWFanatic> CLOMP CLOMP
[2:22:21] <+profanityincluded> Roll FIzzlebeefman
[2:22:21] <pufferfishbones> he's not anywhere near the end no.

[2:22:59] <ChrisM341> Is Pat getting ready for the League Fighter?
[2:23:04] <+ClaudeMcGarren> @ashuckel LUL
[2:23:04] <ElenaManetta> oh no he's dropping the f-bomb
[2:23:05] <InXplotch> hots does a lot of things to make the games artificially shorter, their death timers get much longer much quicker.
[2:23:08] <%vixenpunch> whats funny is that with the changes since you stopped playing on that first try, its become more like HOTS
[2:23:10] <%Animorphimagi> @angriestpat do you like the music that plays in this game?
[2:23:11] <xxafrodragonxx> Big Fuck Bomb

[2:45:15] <+ClaudeMcGarren> @MalphasWing is handsome the word your looking for cmonBruh

[2:46:04] <pufferfishbones> that's why he's named Sam!
[2:46:04] <zenith0111> They should've made it so you can give robots upgrade materials and can send them to structures you built
[2:46:05] <Dakuu75> Philanthropist the game
[2:46:05] <TafferAA> I put all my ziplines at the top of mountains

[3:01:32] <%Meow0369> No pat
[3:01:34] <%doc_ock_rokc> I wonder why the president of the game awards is a preper
[3:01:36] <InXplotch> why are you sad, norman reedus
[3:01:36] <worldbrand> He has one to himself
[3:01:38] <%Meow0369> First prepper has a return quest
[3:01:42] <FrankysDream> @AngriestPat weather station first prepper
[3:01:44] <KaliasTV> That was a very calm network connection
[3:01:44] <duskrush> You could probably haul ass through the rest of the game by this point
[3:01:45] <%J_Papa> The First Prepper has his own retrieval mission, don't do it on stream though
[3:01:47] <Mendin> Presumably lost cargo for them will be in their general area?
[3:01:48] <pufferfishbones> Sam's allergic.
[3:01:54] <ShichiNoBushi> There are some delivery requests from other locations to First Prepper.
[3:01:56] <go4thekneez> how far into this is he?
[3:02:01] <+Nomicro4u> THAT GUY SOUNDS FAMILIAR
[3:02:02] <zenith0111> @mendin Anywhere on the map
[3:02:06] <SpaceGuntank> IT's Payne! GET HIM!
[3:02:13] <Zaphire_Saucypants> yeah, some other people SHOULD have a quest for him. Forget which ones
[3:02:16] <Dakuu75> @Nomicro4u ppl saying it's Max from max pain
[3:02:33] <pufferfishbones> it's Sam Lake, the creator of Max Payne who was his face in the first game.
[3:02:36] <$realm_forge> Npc’s in this game really pile the praise on
[3:02:40] <FrankysDream> weather station had one in my game
[3:02:41] <+Nomicro4u> no wonder
[3:02:45] <Zaphire_Saucypants> but yeah, don't bother with First Prepper on stream.
[3:02:55] <jorniev> WHAT IS THIS GAME...
[3:02:58] <Zaphire_Saucypants> just make sure you do him BEFORE you finish this map
[3:03:04] <Wind_Burst> i maxed first prepper and vet porter with lost cargo

[3:26:03] <heartlesshealer> It's the most anime photorealism has ever been
[3:26:04] <pufferfishbones> this game sold me on the Reedus man, though I don't know anything he's in besides the walking dead. I'm only ever gonna see Sam though.
[3:26:09] <%Mottyrob> That arm must get tired
[3:26:12] <collind99> It’s dumb anime stuff
[3:26:13] <Owlboy7> @AngriestPat Is this the fast travel of this game it takes so long LUL
[3:26:14] <%FrostMass22> Riding this zipline makes me feel like I'm on the Ride with Norman Reedus
[3:26:19] <pufferfishbones> the best boy
[3:26:20] <Felkuros> this game seems easy for anyone that hops into it late..but hard for the first day players

[3:26:48] <coldsama> I feel physically drained just watching him holding all this weight with only one arm to hold on the zipline
[3:26:49] <$ForTheBenmo> America should take notes. Who needs a rail system from NY to LA when you could have a giant zip line!

[3:41:42] <%0oki> Remember the email thing
[3:41:45] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Yes to both questions
[3:41:49] <%mield916> if you have the right mat
[3:41:53] <ChrisM341> Now I'm motivated
[3:41:54] <NotHereToStream> no, its good, its for the stadia
[3:41:55] <%TDotGoat> where pat
[3:41:55] <Nina96> what?
[3:41:56] <waifoong98> Pat has left the stream
[3:41:56] <pufferfishbones> i wouldn't say that
[3:41:58] <%cureneckbeard> pat playing cideo game
[3:41:59] <NeroInfinite> talk to us from acrooss the room pat
[3:42:00] <%cureneckbeard> video
[3:42:04] <%J_Papa> I'm really surprised Pat invalidated the road he spent so much time on with these ziplines
[3:42:05] <%LaughingCatt> yeah
[3:42:06] <dj_arashi_rora> Yeah!
[3:42:07] <+Alec_The_Risktaker> It's good, but someone wants to use it for bad I think
[3:42:11] <peachy996> Why are you hatin on the Network? The Network is great
[3:42:16] <heartlesshealer> not even the chiral network could make stadia work
[3:42:18] <agumon9000> @AngriestPat What are you talking about? The internet is good, it lets you talk to us :)
[3:42:24] <peachy996> Stop hating on the Network
[3:42:27] <agumon9000> Don't question future internet
[3:42:29] <+profanityincluded> @AngriestPat Human Instrumentality is moral Kappa

[3:42:32] <%mostundesired> No shut up it's fine
[3:42:35] <sirrice77> But pat the internet
[3:42:35] <waifoong98> The Network is wifi so obviously he would hate it Kappa
[3:42:37] <SoySocks> are you saying network bad?
[3:42:37] <tiaramaki> "Don't worry about it"
[3:42:39] <pufferfishbones> ghosts or no internet pat, what do you pick?
[3:42:39] <VigilantShield> pat you're paranoid Kappa
[3:42:40] <+Edrem> it's an allegory for the internet and the hate it created
[3:42:40] <+DoctorDerp388> TRUCKIN
[3:42:40] <%SWFanatic> Maybe connections are good And bad
[3:42:41] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> its fine
[3:42:42] <ChrisM341> That's like a new ISP being called the Murder Network
[3:42:44] <%GarbageNirvana> The network-uh
[3:42:44] <%TheMilhouseExperience> But it will make America whole again. How BaD CoUlD iT Be?
[3:42:45] <iamnotaparrot> chiral network will make STADIA work

[3:42:56] <+lethallunacyx> What? noooo that's crazy
[3:42:56] <Sapphire_Breeze> it's fiiiiine
[3:43:00] <+robert_edwards> @ChiralWorks LUL
[3:43:01] <Mendin> It might be The Singularity and not Instrumentality
[3:43:02] <+timmc916> My fellow slugs, i introduce to you: The salt Network. Ittl be great
[3:43:03] <Run44forrest> BUT ZIPLINES THO
[3:43:04] <dartagnan401> what does a transmutation circle mean in this context
[3:43:04] <+lethallunacyx> It's fine
[3:43:05] <+blastazoid26> SKYNET
[3:43:05] <%rytyoung> just keep connecting us shhhhh
[3:43:06] <Artista_AF> why not both
[3:43:09] <%SWFanatic> truckin
[3:43:09] <+Edrem> 7 hours
[3:43:10] <%MoraMiarty> about this much
[3:43:10] <pufferfishbones> a fair bit.
[3:43:10] <%wannabemoogle> Evangelion VS Fullmetal Alchemist
[3:43:11] <$Mekhet09> Almost.
[3:43:11] <MaeMae94> What chapter you on?
[3:43:12] <+profanityincluded> 30%
[3:43:13] <startstoprepeat> the last chapters go by very quickly
[3:43:14] <agumon9000> @AngriestPat If you focus only on the story you got about 2 streams left
[3:43:14] <%J_Papa> Well the ending is really long
[3:43:14] <TafferAA> the endgame is long, like 3-4 hours
[3:43:15] <Sapphire_Breeze> enough
[3:43:15] <Artista_AF> Instrumentality Circle
[3:43:16] <Railgun5> 15% left
[3:43:16] <Mendin> Chap 8
[3:43:17] <NotHereToStream> the end section is fairly linear
[3:43:17] <Zaphire_Saucypants> you're definitely closing in on the point where it story just AVALANCHES at you.
[3:43:17] <%shootbang_exe> you have a solid 6-8 hours
[3:43:20] <%FrostMass22> Close to the end section
[3:43:20] <SoySocks> @MaeMae94 on chapter 8
[3:43:21] <+Punchasaur> I suppose since it’s a ghost network... you could call it... the ETHERNET
[3:43:22] <$Nobody404> 2 hours of cutscene are at the end tho
[3:43:23] <Dakuu75> well, if you're on chapter 3 of fucking 15... I assume you got a metric-fuck-ton to go through
[3:43:23] <valriot> 6 hours
[3:43:25] <+profanityincluded> next stream will start the crescendo
[3:43:26] <heartlesshealer> an ultimate summoning of BTs, probably the five Gazers
[3:43:29] <%SvenHolgersson> Whats the current playtime @AngriestPat
[3:43:30] <MaeMae94> yeah next chapter is getting into endgame
[3:43:32] <%shootbang_exe> @AngriestPat do whatever you wanna do before connecting edge knot
[3:43:34] <+earthboy2k> Like another 15 hours
[3:43:37] <Kongro_> Yeah, depends on how many more standards you do
[3:43:37] <%trustycoyote> @Punchasaur Booooo
[3:43:38] <%FrostMass22> A large chunk of it is a marathon to the finish
[3:43:39] <%J_Papa> Pat why build these ziplines? You built the highway
[3:43:40] <%thenumber5point5> you where getting there, than ran away from progress
[3:43:40] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Punchasaur BOOO
[3:43:41] <%SWFanatic> AHHH
[3:43:42] <%MoraMiarty> I do appreciate how much of this game is building things to circumnavigate gameplay
[3:43:46] <peachy996> Look at how great this Network is and you're hating on it!
[3:43:47] <agumon9000> No
[3:43:47] <pufferfishbones> it's about to get real fuckin weird
[3:43:48] <TheZearGuy> Almost halfway
[3:43:48] <%BallerSwagBro9k> How many chapters?
[3:43:48] <marvel877> 2-3 more streams IF YOU STOP INFRASTRUCTURE
[3:43:49] <%SaiyanShoto> After this chapter it pretty much goes by pretty fast
[3:43:50] <$Mekhet09> You'll know when the game changes.
[3:43:50] <+Edrem> nope, Edge knot city
[3:43:57] <+D00msDayDan> after the relay you go to edge knot
[3:43:58] <agumon9000> No Relay is fine
[3:43:58] <peachy996> Apologize to the Network
[3:43:58] <+profanityincluded> the relay is fine, edge knot itself has to be connected too
[3:43:59] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Don't finish this map before hand
[3:43:59] <17sevens> No, edge knot edge knot
[3:44:01] <%shootbang_exe> @AngriestPat the city itself. There's a distro center before that's safe
[3:44:08] <%J_Papa> These waste your chiral bandwidth
[3:44:09] <worldbrand> Whooo knoooows
[3:44:12] <%0oki> Did he already deliver the pizza?
[3:44:13] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> big zippy
[3:44:14] <%SWFanatic> We built this city on Ziplines
[3:44:18] <valriot> @angriestpat Next stream will have a VERY obvious end point, then final stream will be ending stretch and big Kojima cutscene bullshit
[3:44:18] <pufferfishbones> Sam sounds so happy
[3:44:21] <%rytyoung> Keep on keepin on!
[3:44:22] <agumon9000> @AngriestPat Edge Knot is the point of no return in an RPG
[3:44:23] <%AncelDeLambert> look at this Nightmare Before Christmas road LUL
[3:44:25] <%CrabSlacks> sam really likes ziplines
[3:44:27] <Delenay> why does this road curve like that
[3:44:27] <%SWFanatic> Wooo
[3:44:31] <Mister_McDerp> WOO YEAH
[3:44:33] <+Nomicro4u> Yeeaaah
[3:44:33] <+timmc916> YEAH!
[3:44:33] <NeroInfinite> >wastes bandwidth>but breaks game
[3:44:35] <Delenay> it goes full rainbow road there
[3:44:36] <HoIlywood_SN> @AngriestPat this nation was built on cum and pizza
[3:44:36] <NeroInfinite> HMMM
[3:44:38] <%KevinsLunchbox> im interested in seeing what pat decides to play when he plays league
[3:44:38] <%AncelDeLambert> Oh that's SAM, I thought it was Paige! LUL
[3:44:39] <waifoong98> Wooo yeahh woo yeahhh
[3:44:39] <42nfl19> @AngriestPat Do you care to "100%" before you beat the game?
[3:44:43] <+sleepymastiff> I would def ride a zipline like this, if only it were safe and possible
[3:44:47] <iamnotaparrot> end of episode 9 is point of no return, then the story is a straight shot
[3:44:50] <+ClaudeMcGarren> @CrabSlacks i mean it makes majority of his job super easy
[3:44:50] <pufferfishbones> the ending ending is rather emotional and nice though.
[3:44:52] <%thenumber5point5> you have the scientists then endgame starts
[3:44:55] <%AncelDeLambert> FUCK
[3:45:01] <%J_Papa> Yeah its a looooong end
[3:45:02] <krymzen5> yes, yes it is LUL
[3:45:05] <Zaphire_Saucypants> very long
[3:45:05] <+profanityincluded> its such a good PONR too Kreygasm
[3:45:08] <%FrostMass22> The fucking end felt hours long
[3:45:08] <Sapphire_Breeze> sounds like a plan
[3:45:09] <+TheRealMasterof7s> Roads? Where we're going, we don't need roads.
[3:45:10] <reonome> only 6 hours? kojima is really holding back Kappa
[3:45:11] <agumon9000> Pretty much
[3:45:11] <MaeMae94> Yeah that's a good plan
[3:45:12] <pufferfishbones> its not all cut scenes and is in nice chunks, you'll know when to.
[3:45:12] <heartlesshealer> yeah, that sounds like a good idea
[3:45:13] <+D00msDayDan> actually once you link up edge knot you can still do some running around
[3:45:15] <valriot> That works
[3:45:15] <%shootbang_exe> seems sensible
[3:45:15] <dartagnan401> sounds about right
[3:45:16] <%This_is_Marco> Big fuck stream Kreygasm
[3:45:16] <%WhereIsWill> yeyeye
[3:45:19] <Mister_McDerp> BIG FUCK STREAM Kreygasm
[3:45:20] <peachy996> One Big Fuck stream sounds sexy
[3:45:22] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> 24 hour stream
[3:45:23] <%SWFanatic> feck off ghost

[3:45:33] <%Laecerelius> Gamer goo stream!
[3:45:36] <valriot> @angriestpat You can actually get to that point tonight in like an hour
[3:45:37] <jorniev> BETTER BRING YOUR MOSTER ENERGY DRIKNS FOR THAT STREAM
[3:45:38] <%shootbang_exe> final stream vod is just titled "piss off ghost"
[3:45:38] <dartagnan401> HOW MANY ZIPLINES DOES THIS MAN HAVE?
[3:45:38] <%TDAWS_MP132> it's been like 5 min since you touched the ground
[3:45:39] <+Nomicro4u> wha happen
[3:45:42] <pufferfishbones> the most kojima stuff is in the next chapter imo
[3:45:44] <krymzen5> damn, i shoulda abbused ziplines like pat
[3:45:44] <+Punchasaur> Yeeaaah SoBayed
[3:45:45] <Mister_McDerp> its like there lots of dead people or something
[3:45:45] <%J_Papa> Timefall doesn't always mean BTs
[3:45:50] <%AbnormalVoid> ziplines are way too OP
[3:45:51] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> weird, huh
[3:45:53] <ChrisM341> BYs wanna know the wifi password
[3:45:54] <%MoraMiarty> 2 minutes of zipline
[3:45:54] <agumon9000> @AngriestPat I mean heartman said there was due to past extinctions being here
[3:45:56] <marvel877> Big Fuck Streams usually end up being a shitshow when you're involved, Pat.
[3:45:56] <+profanityincluded> final stream is "Bitch Ginger Ghost" LUL
[3:45:58] <ChrisM341> *BTs
[3:46:00] <Run44forrest> BTs should just wait near a zipline
[3:46:03] <pufferfishbones> rainbow is the BTs
[3:46:04] <+luketrapwalker> I just got back, and we're STILL USING THESE ZIPLINES LUL
[3:46:04] <Sapphire_Breeze> do they though
[3:46:06] <%FrostMass22> @pufferfishbones The end of this game is some of the craziest bullshit
[3:46:08] <+D00msDayDan> no, the strands only mean timefall
[3:46:12] <%InugamiTheHound> we need woolie in here saying "bitch *bleep* ghosts"
[3:46:14] <heartlesshealer> hook up the internet to initiate the rapture
[3:46:17] <%SWFanatic> thick ropey strands
[3:46:17] <%Mattcowdisease6> I gotta pick up some miccy dees...dont...go...anywhere
[3:46:23] <%AncelDeLambert> are we in the Rockys ALREADY?!
[3:46:24] <%doc_ock_rokc> @pufferfishbones is that... the rainbowconnection?
[3:46:24] <zenith0111> @run44forrest You can set your custom Hologram to be a BT on the structure LUL
[3:46:25] <LunarRemix> At this point do you even care about the story or are you just doing it because it feels good to deliver shit?
[3:46:27] <Mendin> The big fuckoff inverse rainbow is probably the BTs
[3:46:31] <NeroInfinite> That safe house just zorped it self into existence.
[3:46:32] <pufferfishbones> I mean the actual last mission, I thought it was really like I don't wanna spoil. But it got me bad.
[3:46:33] <%Divryne> @AngriestPat No Pat the strands mean strands.
[3:46:33] <Dakuu75> but...s trands mean time-fall and time-fall SOMETIMES means BTs?
[3:46:35] <%thenumber5point5> warning the ending ~2hours is basically a MGS4 interactive movie
[3:46:36] <marvel877> 70 hours to figure that out, huh Pat?
[3:46:39] <Zereaux> @AngriestPat hey pat do you know if yours paiges and eli's tng stream is archived anywhere?
[3:46:41] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> make rope

[3:46:53] <%0oki> Pat wait!
[3:46:55] <krymzen5> i was worried i'd not have enough resources to do this on the network, but damn was i wrong LUL
[3:46:56] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat ya shoulda roped
[3:46:58] <%0oki> Don’t deliver
[3:47:01] <%SvenHolgersson> I mean its a Kojima game so I just expect a movie

[3:54:08] <ivansonic08> Why don't you put a climbing rope?
[3:54:08] <+Qsmash_> why is Norman Redus pregnant?
[3:54:09] <+ClaudeMcGarren> DO A FLIP
[3:54:11] <%bevyrage> i stepped away for a moment and missed it so i'm clipping it anyway
[3:54:12] <+Alec_The_Risktaker> use the terrain scanner

[3:54:14] <HeroToxiko> DO A BARREL ROLL
[3:54:16] <%Tearonex> BUT
[3:54:17] <Mister_McDerp> I can't believe santa died
[3:54:18] <NeroInfinite> Do aflip pat
[3:54:18] <%Kiiper> wait, so randomally dying doesn't cause a voidout?
[3:54:19] <pufferfishbones> because Kojima got him pregnant
[3:54:19] <%SWFanatic> flip off with both hands
[3:54:24] <+Punchasaur> Wasn’t a fucking link moobot you shit

[3:54:26] <+SladeClegane> Sliding is probably safer honestly.
[3:54:28] <ChrisM341> Do a kickflip
[3:54:29] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Do a double jump!
[3:54:31] <heartlesshealer> killing santa, now we're really tim allen
[3:54:32] <TafferAA> Only BTs eating humans causes voidouts
[3:54:33] <jorgenbob> Pat have you made any craters in the game world yet?
[3:54:35] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> you gotta believe pat!
[3:54:38] <peachy996> tree fiddy?
[3:54:39] <TheZearGuy> I thought if you died it made a voidout
[3:54:41] <%GeneralSCPatton> @kiiper Voidouts are when BTs eat living people
[3:54:44] <zenith0111> @kiiper Death never causes voidouts.
[3:54:46] <pufferfishbones> that truck ate shit
[3:54:47] <Namillus> That truck is crashed.
[3:54:50] <+Alec_The_Risktaker> @TheZearGuy only if a BT eat you
[3:54:50] <+ClaudeMcGarren> @TheZearGuy no thats if you die to bts
[3:54:54] <Sapphire_Breeze> @TheZearGuy only if a BT kills you
[3:54:55] <heartlesshealer> Voidouts are when the ghosts eat you
[3:54:55] <NeroInfinite> it only voidsout if yu die to ABT
[3:54:56] <TheZearGuy> Ok then
[3:54:59] <%cureneckbeard> wheee
[3:55:00] <ScreamLord> @TheZearGuy Only if a B.T eats him
[3:55:02] <eldragon_1> @TheZearGuy when a BT eats you
[3:55:11] <%J_Papa> Yeah i went from South Distro toward Weather Station then forked off at the mountaints toward First Prepper and Roboticist
[3:55:12] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> delete one then and move it
[3:55:15] <InXplotch> is there an upgrade above 350?
[3:55:18] <$Nobody404> I think BTs can eat the dead too, that's why you gotta burn bodies. The BT will eat the corpse when it pops out?
[3:55:20] <%Ascethetic> its a truckin graveyard
[3:55:22] <zenith0111> FINALLY a chat this knows how Voidouts work!

[3:55:47] <Gregorhasjoined> PEE ON IT
[3:55:49] <$Mekhet09> Should have put it on the mount peak.
[3:55:49] <startstoprepeat> bts can't eat the dead, fully necro'd dead become bts which'll cause a void out when they eat someone
[3:55:51] <%SWFanatic> *GASP*
[3:55:54] <dj_arashi_rora> ARA ARA TRUCK-KUN
[3:55:54] <heartlesshealer> you can't just put one at the max distance every time when you're doing mountains
[3:56:01] <Psyramics> @Nobody404 No, the BT spawns from the corpse, and then will eat any nearby living person and cause a voidout

[4:02:07] <%SGrim> Don't do anything cool. I have to deal with family.
[4:02:08] <agumon9000> @AngriestPat Alright there I tweeted you the picture. 👍
[4:02:10] <Mendin> it was a citrus fruit fiesta, Stace
[4:02:14] <agumon9000> The clip*
[4:02:15] <dreu81> is there a level 3 bola gun? srsly
[4:02:15] <+Alec_The_Risktaker> @Neo_Kaiser ???
[4:02:16] <Monkeyweed21> what about the SPEED SKELETON
[4:02:16] <%J_Papa> I like the Riot Shotgun
[4:02:19] <Dakuu75> Bloodborn fans love having a Bloodtinge build gun and grenades, lol
[4:02:20] <$Mekhet09> Not speed skeleton?
[4:02:21] <+Malogor> ebola gun? wut?
[4:02:21] <HeroToxiko> pets moobot for a job well done
[4:02:22] <Sokumotanaka> J-jumpscare porn? Please say sike
[4:02:25] <SSBBfan666> @AngriestPat is the sticky gun any good, been looking to use it against MULE camps.
[4:02:27] <%MoraMiarty> pm'd you the link ;)
[4:02:28] <iamnotaparrot> resident evil smash spirits are weord
[4:02:29] <@ShockzNDrawe> Pat what is this stupid video game bullshit
[4:02:29] <superchronicc> what is more fitting than using a stick to fire a rope
[4:02:30] <Mendin> And he keeps doing it
[4:02:34] <Doomstar16> Wow. Quite a few people have used tothse
[4:02:34] <$Mekhet09> Speed skeleton and superman jumping is my favorite.
[4:02:39] <krymzen5> it's weird
[4:02:39] <pufferfishbones> sticky gun is fun
[4:02:40] <%StaceMcGate> @Mendin I don't know what any of that means and now I'm more curious than ever
[4:02:48] <%Kirby_Sauce> Cheer500 not caught up now. Ever hear of risk legacy pat? it's super cool, as each game influences the story, after your people stargate to an unpopulated earth. The box is sealed with a sticker stating "Whats done cannot be undone" and opening the box, you are greeted by a large sticker stating: "we, the undersigned understand and take responsibility for the fact that what is done, is done by our decisions. [large space] the war began on the following date:". when you win, you get to name
[4:02:50] <pufferfishbones> make sure to catch the package though
[4:02:56] <+D00msDayDan> sticky gun is great for recovery missions
[4:02:58] <iamnotaparrot> they're just smash spirits for Chris, Leon, jill, and wesker.
[4:02:59] <Dakuu75> holy-donational-paragraphs-batman
[4:03:02] <pufferfishbones> get ghoste
[4:03:07] <pufferfishbones> aww no ghoste
[4:03:15] <Mendin> @StaceMcGate Back in the olden days of early 2000s internet, there were Three Big Shock Websites. One of the Goat, one of the Tub, and one of the Lemon
[4:03:15] <tiaramaki> Wait what
[4:03:17] <dreu81> the acronym guy should give you the $5000 deus ex jacket
[4:03:19] <Swish19XX> Baldman
[4:03:22] <%ThatOneGuyYouSaw> oh shit, when did he get the santa hat?
[4:03:22] <%MoraMiarty> does it have a public room
[4:03:23] <KasiCrafter> Yeah...Well...
[4:03:26] <%TheMilhouseExperience> @ssbbfan666 I use the sticky guns to retrieve loose/lost packages and that’s about it.
[4:03:29] <%CrabSlacks> just sleep in your locker void
[4:03:29] <agumon9000> @AngriestPat I tweeted ya the clip. Its good stuff
[4:03:32] <+Punchasaur> I call my penis the sticky gun
[4:03:34] <Mendin> The link was for the lattermost
[4:03:44] <ivansonic08> Are BT's even a threath in this point of the game?
[4:03:48] <%Forente> santa!
[4:03:55] <SSBBfan666> speaking of paetreon, yall hear Onision got his deleted?
[4:03:56] <TafferAA> @ivansonic08 nah
[4:03:59] <pufferfishbones> if you get too much smug in a snow area
[4:04:01] <%StaceMcGate> @Mendin ohh, just say that. Unless it's banned? You might as well add a 4th, the glorious spin
[4:04:04] <%xcompleasedad> Ah........ the teleporter run. Gotta love it!
[4:04:05] <%Kirby_Sauce> cheer500 continents, bulid big cities, and all other kinds of stuff to influence future games, and the other players who survived get to influence the board in minor ways too. the winner also gets a nuke. yep. lets you turn ANY roll by ANY player into a 6. any player, proxy wars much? the game also has special sealed envelopes on the roof of the box with criteria like: "open when all continents have been named", "open when 3 or more missles are used", "Do not open. Ever."
[4:04:06] <%FrostMass22> @ivansonic08 Only if he ever gets caught by a big one
[4:04:12] <@ShockzNDrawe> every time I decide to come here while you stream this game I find myself having several question about wtf you are either wearing or doing
[4:04:19] <Dakuu75> ah, a 2-page essay
[4:04:22] <iamnotaparrot> good, onision is a mega pedo
[4:04:28] <%cureneckbeard> nyannHi
[4:04:40] <superchronicc> even if you dont have a network around some BT'S the speed skeleton makes getting through them a breeze
[4:04:42] <%axellogic> Cue pizza to elder

[4:05:02] <HeroToxiko> @pufferfishbones some chud troll in the early naughties paid for ad space on a billboard to a horrid website. the "joke" is an image of old folks, that's all you need to know
[4:05:05] <+Punchasaur> Who is onision
[4:05:05] <%StaceMcGate> Onision diddling kids? Or just caught in the act of grooming?
[4:05:06] <Dakuu75> was that woolies ladder there
[4:05:11] <%ThatOneGuyYouSaw> Shantae 4 Smash
[4:05:11] <%CrabSlacks> he will die and now it will take years for someone to find his mummy
[4:05:12] <SSBBfan666> @Killhooligan yeah. plus all the stuff coming out about him and his dealings,
[4:05:15] <%KevinsLunchbox> you'll regret talking shit about resins when some new thing shows up and needs resins
[4:05:27] <$Mekhet09> Nothing important needs them.
[4:05:32] <%xtremegamer80> Is resin useful at all?
[4:05:33] <%xcompleasedad> @KevinsLunchbox it WON'T
[4:05:39] <pufferfishbones> its what ya shoes are made of
[4:05:43] <+LtSergei> i think resins are only used for small, hand-held things
[4:05:46] <+LtSergei> shoes
[4:05:47] <agumon9000> Boots
[4:05:47] <MaeMae94> boots
[4:05:48] <dreu81> i beat the game last weekend and i dont recall using resins for anything
[4:05:48] <superchronicc> some poor soul is missing that pcc
[4:05:50] <%KevinsLunchbox> that must mean resins are the megaelixirs of death stranding probably
[4:05:52] <%Divryne> Everything.
[4:05:53] <%bevyrage> boots and cats
[4:05:55] <ShichiNoBushi> Boots and climbing anchors.
[4:05:55] <%xcompleasedad> @xtremegamer80 It is basically only for crafting.
[4:05:55] <Bigbossman91> backpack cover
[4:05:56] <Monkeyweed21> boots, ropes etc
[4:05:57] <%AbnormalVoid> various things
[4:05:57] <Mendin> The freshest of boots
[4:05:57] <%J_Papa> Plenty of things, just in small amounts so you never care
[4:05:59] <waifoong98> gunplas Kappa
[4:05:59] <+LtSergei> oh, bola guns i think
[4:06:00] <ShichiNoBushi> I think Skeletons, too.
[4:06:00] <startstoprepeat> equipment, but never in great amounts
[4:06:02] <%xcompleasedad> And it is never in large amounts
[4:06:03] <NotHereToStream> blood bags
[4:06:09] <Sunstalker> Resins are phoenix downs? vadeHm
[4:06:09] <pufferfishbones> bro what if Sam could have a cat in the private room
[4:06:11] <%SWFanatic> PE NUS
[4:06:11] <agumon9000> Boots Guns Blood Bags
[4:06:14] <dreu81> upgrades for zip lines?
[4:06:17] <%xcompleasedad> Highest cost is around 300?
[4:06:20] <SSBBfan666> @FrostMass22 so you'd rather let Onision continue his pedo grooming act?
[4:06:21] <ShichiNoBushi> No major costs such as for construction, I believe.
[4:06:24] <%xcompleasedad> And that thing LASTS
[4:06:28] <%SWFanatic> My Ding Ding Dong

[4:09:22] <%StaceMcGate> What killed the Dinosaurs? The Ice Age!
[4:09:22] <%LouieRouie> heartman has a heart shaped heart
[4:09:24] <+Punchasaur> I thought the dinosaurs got killed by the WOLBACHIA
[4:09:25] <dreu81> two things dinosaurs didn't have -- 1. Feathers. 2. Souls
[4:09:26] <heartlesshealer> if dinosaurs were so stupid, how did they build the internet and cause the death stranding?

[4:09:51] <%FrostMass22> @ssbbfan666 If Patreon knows that his grounding is aiding him grooming kids, I agree he should be kicked off. My problem is that people have been kicked off Patreon before and, seeing as how things are going, it's going to get worse as more people are removed.
[4:09:52] <iamnotaparrot> he hasn't finished it yet man
[4:09:54] <@ShockzNDrawe> cuz this really is video gamey
[4:09:57] <%xcompleasedad> @ShockzNDrawe The teleporters?

[4:10:23] <HeroToxiko> people just built those ziplines to plat the game, unless there is something around here later
[4:10:24] <+paladinstarbuster> wow

[4:10:26] <Mendin> Risk: Legacy
[4:10:28] <%Meidolaon> Fact of the matter is though that Sakura > Rin > Artoria
[4:10:32] <heartlesshealer> Thank you
[4:10:33] <%GarbageNirvana> Your message is killing the stream
[4:10:33] <Mendin> The first of the Legacy-type games

[4:10:43] <zenith0111> DO NOT OPEN EVER
[4:10:43] <%Alpha8087> Legacy at Risk
[4:10:45] <@ShockzNDrawe> does norman reedus rag doll?
[4:10:46] <jorniev> that sounds nuts
[4:10:48] <Romuken> Yo Pat, finishing with episode 7 and it just hit me. The bridge jingle. Isn't it the beginning to the London Bridge nursery rhyme?
[4:10:52] <%ThatOneGuyYouSaw> Illya > Rin > Seibah > Shit > Sakura
[4:10:54] <waifoong98> Risk as in the board game?
[4:10:54] <@ShockzNDrawe> I would accept this if he ragdolled

[4:11:09] <%thenumber5point5> Random anime recommendation. Dr Stone watched it today was shocked how much enjoyed it
[4:11:09] <+Punchasaur> Shut up about fate chat no one cares
[4:11:15] <agumon9000> @AngriestPat Btw I hate how good the thunder sounds in this game since I have good headphones and I think its actually thundering
[4:11:19] <SSBBfan666> @AngriestPat what would you rank Death Stranding's story to Kojima's other work?
[4:11:19] <%starzo0> @Romuken it totally is
[4:11:20] <dreu81> unlike big boss, sam is an actual legend who didn't hide behind a body double
[4:11:22] <%xcompleasedad> @ShockzNDrawe To disastrous results. To him.
[4:11:22] <Mendin> It also has the game end a lot faster than standard Risk, you can cash in army cards for VP, you have a HQ which is worth a VP, and if you've never won a game before, you start with an extra VP
[4:11:23] <iamnotaparrot> fate is big garbo
[4:11:23] <%Meidolaon> Clearly people care Kappa
[4:11:24] <+lokstir> did Peter molyneux make that game

[4:11:32] <Romuken> BRUH that's messed up @starzo0
[4:11:32] <Mendin> You need, I think, 4 VP to win a game of R:L
[4:11:32] <Monkeyweed21> SAVE US WITH PADORU

[4:12:12] <pufferfishbones> because they both outlive their welcome
[4:12:13] <Dakuu75> Zip-Lines are jsut Truckin for your hands

[4:12:36] <%ThatOneGuyYouSaw> Kimi to > padoru
[4:12:37] <ne0bunny> question, if I delete peoples bad ziplines from my game, will new ones pop up? or should I just try to work around them?
[4:12:40] <%StaceMcGate> I feel like there are people who spent over $2000 on Fate in chat
[4:12:42] <pufferfishbones> pizza missions most important mission
[4:12:44] <+NitronStreams> If a guy in a truck is a trucker does that make a guy on a zipline zipper
[4:12:44] <Romuken> @AngriestPat I'm scared that the bridges are gonna fall now. Not a spoiler, I'm actually just a watcher and know as much as you do from mid episode 7 but now I'm spooked.
[4:12:45] <%SWFanatic> Pat VS Mountain 2: Electric Zipline a roo

[4:14:55] <dreu81> i clipped through a mountain outside of port knot city. taht was fun
[4:14:55] <silverira> you can have fun with league just dont do it on the stream
[4:14:55] <Neo_Kaiser> Pat, let's be honest. The only reason why you want to play LoL is because you're feeling the Loot Box itch.
[4:14:56] <%daveglhf> daveglhf subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 31 months! get ready for the unending torrent of "but dota2"
[4:14:57] <%Meow0369> Are we talking about the outer worlds?
[4:14:59] <Mendin> Hey Pat, HBomberGuy just released a video a day or two ago about the survival horror game Pathologic, ever played it or thought about it?
[4:15:01] <%SaiyanShoto> At least you give things a shot
[4:15:02] <T_Sasquatch> i forgot fornite exists tbh
[4:15:05] <Dakuu75> Fucking Mt. Gagazet over here
[4:15:05] <%TheMilhouseExperience> League is such a stressing game for a gaming pc...
[4:15:06] <Mister_McDerp> its too late to save pat now, hes been tarnished
[4:15:07] <%thenumber5point5> just play DOTA 2 auto chess
[4:15:08] <%CrabSlacks> he played pubg too, but stopped because paige was better at it than him
[4:15:10] <valriot> @angriestpat I don't think you realise that League is more stream poison than that other thing you played that nobody watched
[4:15:12] <ChrisM341> We talking bout fort fight?
[4:15:14] <%SlimeSlimeSlime> Mobas are a trash genre that need to die out.
[4:15:17] <pufferfishbones> pathologic is good but the devs don't like it being called a game.
[4:15:18] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat When is the last time you bought a lootbox?
[4:15:18] <+Punchasaur> It’s like how people are upset you won’t say padoru. They’re fucking stupid Kappa
[4:15:21] <waifoong98> can't wait for the mobas jargons on le podcast heh doodBait
[4:15:24] <pufferfishbones> they call it a "disease simulator"
[4:15:24] <InXplotch> @AngriestPat if you play league and are not playing with friends or fans, I highly recommend doing /muteall. while the game tries to keep smurfs away from actual new players but occasionally you'll get matched with salty mother fuckers
[4:15:25] <%Meidolaon> PADORU PADORU
[4:15:25] <Jrocy247> Next thing you know, Pat's gonna stream NBA 2K20
[4:15:27] <djFishmonger> How far into streaming is he? Just got back from shittyweork
[4:15:27] <juicysal> No League, Start Teppen!
[4:15:28] <akaSiggy> @AngriestPat 12 Minute speed run of Outer Worlds? It's literally just a point to point, no side quest story only run.
[4:15:28] <pufferfishbones> The Void is better ;)
[4:15:29] <%Bailey__gaming> Santa hat
[4:15:30] <+LtSergei> my thoughts on hbomberguy's video is he doesn't need to take two hours to tell people why something is worth playing

[4:16:11] <InXplotch> is there a hard limit on ziplines?
[4:16:14] <%MoraMiarty> @AngriestPat would you ever be open to playing the Kingdom Hearts series, maybe with woolie? Or is the series as a concept too ridiculous for you. I feel like the absurdity could carry you through whatever boredom you might experience.
[4:16:15] <MrDonTacos_> the LoL community is the absolute worst tho

[4:16:20] <InXplotch> or can you build as many as you have resource for?
[4:16:23] <ChrisM341> Get ready for the next battle
[4:16:25] <%J_Papa> Usually best to stagger ziplines across a mountain not straight up it
[4:16:27] <CptHarlok> BR games have slowed down because there's only one or two shows in town and they will beat you the fuck down everytime.
[4:16:29] <%Meidolaon> Probably not, she doesn't look like she's wearing blackface after all
[4:16:30] <%Meow0369> Hey pat finish the game this stream no worries
[4:16:32] <prhymes321> cue skyrim music
[4:16:33] <T_Sasquatch> @LtSergei ex-fucking-actly, a good reviewer doesn't need to take hours to make an introspective video liike its a movie, its insane
[4:16:39] <%Animorphimagi> UMU
[4:16:42] <Mendin> @InXplotch There's a bandwidth resource that all constructables take up
[4:16:42] <JustaStove> How goes the league learning pat?
[4:16:47] <Ajanimentorofheros> @inxplotch you have to be mindful of the bandwidth.
[4:16:47] <zenith0111> Man if Pat, Woolie or Mat finish Kingdom Hearts that'd be amazing
[4:16:51] <Neo_Kaiser> MauLers videos are awesome.
[4:16:51] <InXplotch> including roads?
[4:16:52] <%ThatOneGuyYouSaw> @Meidolaon Albert did single her and Demiya out, so I dunno
[4:16:53] <KaliasTV> He's going pro
[4:16:56] <%TheMilhouseExperience> The feel of a traversal game...
[4:16:56] <%DrFacilier> where is he at currently story wise?
[4:17:00] <Mendin> Roads I think dont count
[4:17:00] <Mister_McDerp> stop answering them
[4:17:03] <%SWFanatic> Pats going Pro?
[4:17:04] <%Meow0369> Hey pat how goes the league learning
[4:17:04] <%StaceMcGate> SHOCK
[4:17:04] <waifoong98> shocking
[4:17:05] <+brightman42> have you tried manually loading the game yet and seen that it has like 40~50 rolling auto save slots?
[4:17:07] <Mendin> Mid chapter 8
[4:17:09] <%marsanta> SEEM
[4:17:09] <Nina96> they are
[4:17:10] <%sirisvirus> LEAGUE!!!
[4:17:11] <silverira> hey @AngriestPat why are the streams starting so early?
[4:17:11] <@commanderclaw> It's a lifestyle game
[4:17:11] <%Bailey__gaming> they are
[4:17:11] <%AncelDeLambert> it's a SPORT, Pat, we expect practice
[4:17:13] <+jiggy_snipe> were you bad?
[4:17:13] <%Forente> feral really
[4:17:14] <JustaStove> I just came into stream and wanted to ask, my apologies
[4:17:14] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> are ya winnin son?
[4:17:14] <arbeh> League people are beyond Fate people
[4:17:15] <dreu81> pat is finishing up the mountain stuff about to head to the tar belt
[4:17:15] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Like right here.
[4:17:15] <%MoraMiarty> oh, right I forgot matt and woolie started it up
[4:17:15] <redrins> pat is playing in the next lcs
[4:17:16] <NeroInfinite> SEEM
[4:17:17] <zenith0111> JUST SAYINH
[4:17:17] <+cvp5127> worst than fate fans Kappa
[4:17:18] <Bustahhwulf> learning league retroKEKW waste of time
[4:17:19] <Jrocy247> SEE that's why you shouldn't play League, They're LITERALLY insane
[4:17:19] <cherrycottontail> I mean I would love to talk about HOTS more
[4:17:20] <%MoraMiarty> its probabl a no go then
[4:17:20] <%Meidolaon> They might just claim she's older since she's taller than Nero anyways
[4:17:21] <%SWFanatic> Are ya winning bobbo?
[4:17:21] <Romuken> uuuuuh may I be brought up to speed? Just got on to watch the stream and just got to Deadman's aBRIDGE series in episode 7.
[4:17:23] <spyder_casual> its cus they are
[4:17:24] <%Meow0369> Insanity likely
[4:17:24] <%CrabSlacks> a single match and he's already platinum
[4:17:25] <%vectorless_peon> League people are ferrel
[4:17:26] <%R3Roundabout> They play a MOBA, of course they are insane
[4:17:27] <Monkeyweed21> I CANT BELIEVE PATS GOING PRO
[4:17:30] <ivansonic08> If you pllay online get ready for teammates yellling at you
[4:17:32] <Ajanimentorofheros> League people are worse than Fate people.
[4:17:34] <%MoraMiarty> feels like an eternity
[4:17:36] <NeroInfinite> They're fera l beasts
[4:17:37] <@ShockzNDrawe> I genuinely wonder when people will realize that bombarding Pat with weird obscure references and discussion about your thing is the fastest way for him to not give a fuck about that thing.
[4:17:38] <waifoong98> playing mobas will make u PJSalt -y everyday LUL
[4:17:41] <Neo_Kaiser> Which is worse, League players or Melee players?
[4:17:41] <SpaceGuntank> MOBA player are insane? oh perish the thought Kappa
[4:17:42] <Bloodworks12> You should play Smite.
[4:17:42] <InXplotch> You really should use bot macros for chat, pat. a !league command that just says "I PLAYED ONE GAME IUNNO" would probably be enough
[4:17:42] <NeroInfinite> A step below the weebs
[4:17:44] <%StaceMcGate> Fate is worse than league, let's be real
[4:17:46] <%SWFanatic> Remember that time when Pat went PRO and then got rich and famous
[4:17:48] <Mister_McDerp> chat is full of league and fate, this is a new low
[4:17:49] <ChrisM341> Is Pat gonna train for his FT10 with Eyepatch wolf?
[4:17:54] <$Nobody404> Did you win that game tho? 100% win rate
[4:17:56] <JustaStove> I play mobas and fighting games, my mental is completely broken
[4:17:56] <%TheMilhouseExperience> It’s like that one scene in Rambo part 2 with the rats.
[4:17:57] <CptHarlok> I trust gacha players more than moba's tbh.
[4:18:03] <%Meow0369> Anyone who plays mobas are already qualified for disability payments
[4:18:03] <T_Sasquatch> pat literally didn't know what a ward is until he went on twitter LUL
[4:18:06] <CptHarlok> And that's saying something
[4:18:09] <%Meidolaon> Ironic that a guy called NeroInfinite is complaining about Padoru and Umu LUL LUL
[4:18:11] <waifoong98> LUL
[4:18:11] <VigilantShield> well that works
[4:18:11] <%J_Papa> I wonder how many likes we'll have if we check back into this game in a year
[4:18:12] <Mendin> @Romuken Deadman's having you connect up a bunch of area scientists to network up and figure a way across BIG TAR GOO LAND to get to Edge Knot
[4:18:14] <%thenumber5point5> Pat only notices your shit posts, that's how this works
[4:18:15] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> LUL
[4:18:17] <valriot> @shockzndrawe Yeah that's why we're giving him League references Kappa
[4:18:18] <katocrimson> delete middle one
[4:18:19] <%SWFanatic> DO IT
[4:18:20] <+Punchasaur> At least the league people aren’t spamming and harassing pat about it
[4:18:26] <NeroInfinite> There are two neros
[4:18:31] <NeroInfinite> Threeneros
[4:18:31] <Mendin> @Romuken Sorry, Heartman
[4:18:33] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> useless!
[4:18:33] <%Meow0369> @thenumber5point5 Indeed, no doubt if I post some dumb shit he'll read it
[4:18:35] <coldsama> Saying League community is toxic is like saying Fortnite cause there is a lot of young players, community is immature,one of the most played competitive game ever of course it will have tons of people means tons of toxic
[4:18:35] <+cvp5127> umu
[4:18:36] <%StaceMcGate> Kids, kids, kids... you'll all awful
[4:18:37] <%SWFanatic> There was a zipline here, its gone now
[4:18:39] <%SvenHolgersson> Did you get to the end where you find out it was the dog from Silent Hill
[4:18:40] <+Punchasaur> Not as much as the fate people anyway
[4:18:40] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Alls well that ends well.
[4:18:42] <%ThatOneGuyYouSaw> LIZ LOVE
[4:18:43] <dreu81> mountain conquered
[4:18:45] <DracaenaLeaf> The one time I tried league, I was in the tutorial zone and the game froze everyone's characters except for spinning around. Never really bothered going back
[4:18:50] <NeroInfinite> One is from history the other is from DMC
[4:18:54] <Romuken> Thanks @Mendin , makes sense. Also wow there goes the midwest, deep in tar XD
[4:18:55] <LunarRemix> Fortnite isn't really toxic, there's no chat.
[4:18:56] <waifoong98> LUL
[4:18:56] <Monkeyweed21> DRINK MONSTER TO WARM YOURSELF
[4:18:56] <%Meow0369> @coldsama League is cancer and so is fortnite. Whataboutism mate,
[4:19:01] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Toss it down the cliff to watch it roll
[4:19:02] <zenith0111> I love seeing the obligatory LOL defenses LUL
[4:19:02] <%rubber_johnny29> !uptime
[4:19:02] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 19m.
[4:19:05] <%iHum4n> but heroes of the storm tho
[4:19:08] <+MurlinDurl> no i didnt actually
[4:19:08] <@commanderclaw> Did you know though
[4:19:09] <pufferfishbones> bro make a heating pad for sam
[4:19:11] <+Solutha> and theres no dumb rune grind
[4:19:15] <%Bailey__gaming> @angriestpat I was wondering what your stance is on Rouge likes? I'd love a chill stream of Slay the spire or more darkeast dungeon
[4:19:16] <%AncelDeLambert> yeah, they're free, and therefore you're paralyzed for choice
[4:19:16] <waifoong98> but Heros of Never whatever it's called Kappa
[4:19:17] <$Nobody404> I played one LoL game as well, everyone told me they were reporting me for feeding because I was bad
[4:19:19] <redrins> did you know that dying is much worse in dota 2
[4:19:20] <%Meow0369> Hey pat read this shitpost comment out loud to prove my point
[4:19:20] <Mister_McDerp> and no one cares about dota
[4:19:21] <coldsama> @meow0369 That you are big boomer?
[4:19:22] <%Alpha8087> Didn't they revise DotA2 recently? I dont play but recall hearing that.
[4:19:22] <Zombrocom> Dota2 is an insane clusterfuck
[4:19:23] <%Divryne> Your friends have bad taste.
[4:19:23] <+profanityincluded> not our fault that your friends are plebs Kappa
[4:19:25] <%iHum4n> but battleborn tho
[4:19:27] <deviate_dv8> time for better friends
[4:19:29] <%StaceMcGate> I liked hots, but it has been a dying playerbase
[4:19:31] <NeroInfinite> The third Nero is the alt timeline
[4:19:33] <%Meow0369> @coldsama Whataboutism mate, you can'
[4:19:33] <%Meidolaon> Who tf even is Punchsaur anyways LUL LUL
[4:19:34] <Swish19XX> But For Honor tho
[4:19:34] <%oAznoUta> is the LoL crowd still banning people for all but breathing?
[4:19:35] <%CrabSlacks> a friend playing league is no friend at all
[4:19:36] <+jiggy_snipe> @Nobody404 sounds accurate
[4:19:36] <%SvenHolgersson> Dota 2 has a fucking stupid learning curve because the game straight up lied to you when it first came out
[4:19:37] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> smelly friends
[4:19:38] <valriot> What about Mafense Of Ba Ancients?
[4:19:38] <InXplotch> considering pat played hots, I doubt it'd be an even remotely reasonable jump to dota
[4:19:39] <%umbypokochan> friends don't let friends play LoL
[4:19:40] <%AncelDeLambert> DOTA2 has way too much going on, it's impossible to learn
[4:19:44] <Neo_Kaiser> Why doesn't Pat just play Warcraft 3?
[4:19:44] <ivansonic08> Playt Radical heights!
[4:19:46] <+Darren716> But Paaat, league makes you smell
[4:19:47] <Mister_McDerp> I've never met anyone that played dota
[4:19:47] <zenith0111> I played LOL and realised I'm just too toxic for that game LUL
[4:19:48] <%Meow0369> @coldsama You can't excuse bullshit with totally unrelated bullshit. That shit doesn't fly
[4:19:50] <InXplotch> the gap btwn hots and league is small than hots to dota by a lot
[4:19:52] <+Dr_Mooose> play Smite, dare you to @ me
[4:19:52] <pufferfishbones> yes...
[4:19:54] <Mendin> I miss Gigantic
[4:19:57] <%MakotoPB> look at this asshole bragging about having friends
[4:19:59] <Mendin> Who played Gigantic
[4:19:59] <+PanicSwytch> But we ARE your fri3nds
[4:20:03] <MrDonTacos_> if all your friends liked cocaine would you try it?
[4:20:03] <%Flambage> @AngriestPat Any games worth getting during the steam sale going on now?
[4:20:08] <%KevinsLunchbox> i remember when plague was playing league but mostly AI games
[4:20:08] <%AncelDeLambert> Smite is awkward to look at
[4:20:15] <InXplotch> imagine playing a game made by hi rez
[4:20:16] <%DrFacilier> no
[4:20:16] <%Meow0369> I forgot smite existed
[4:20:19] <%AncelDeLambert> not really
[4:20:22] <%PlainSimpleTailor> RE2
[4:20:23] <%AncelDeLambert> okay, those two
[4:20:25] <%WhereIsWill> dont listen to none of us just do the thing LUL
[4:20:27] <Monkeyweed21> disco elysium
[4:20:29] <TurtlesAndTentacles> what I hots?
[4:20:30] <+Dr_Mooose> uh what!
[4:20:30] <%AncelDeLambert> .... I'm torn
[4:20:31] <+Darren716> Disco Elysum is 20% off
[4:20:33] <%sirisvirus> code vein is 30% off its pretty good
[4:20:34] <%Meow0369> Disco Elysium is the greatest
[4:20:35] <valriot> BUY IT, BIG VIDEOGAMES
[4:20:35] <%AncelDeLambert> RE2 is DEFINITELY not for me
[4:20:36] <%Alpha8087> Disco Elysium yeah!
[4:20:37] <%trustycoyote> Holy Shit! Really?1 Yes. BUY those now.
[4:20:38] <+Punchasaur> @meidolaon are you really that butthurt that I don’t like your shitty waifu fan service trash?
[4:20:38] <pufferfishbones> disco elysium is cool
[4:20:40] <%AncelDeLambert> I KEEP TELLING YOU
[4:20:41] <Mendin> Skullgirls is dirt cheap, of course
[4:20:44] <%MelBrooksKA> City Skylines is only 7 bucks
[4:20:45] <%AncelDeLambert> I'M WRONG ABOUT EVERYTHING!
[4:20:50] <%J_Papa> is it true DMC5 wasn't nominated for anything at TGA?
[4:20:50] <hairtoday> star control and baldur
[4:20:51] <%Meow0369> I just finished it yesterday
[4:20:53] <juicebars> When did this DOOMer get the sick santa hat wow
[4:20:53] <ChrisM341> Did Pat hear about the RE3 rumors?
[4:20:54] <InXplotch> I should check if the hat in time dlc is on sale
[4:20:58] <%Alpha8087> It speaks to my D&D Dungeonmaster soul
[4:21:00] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Skullgirls is always a recommendation
[4:21:01] <Mendin> The Surge 1 is 7bux
[4:21:02] <%SvenHolgersson> HE LEARNED IT FROM YOU PAT
[4:21:02] <pufferfishbones> action?
[4:21:03] <%StaceMcGate> Buy Skullgirls and play with the 8 other people still online
[4:21:04] <CptHarlok> I stopped playing DMC after 2 because it was fucking terrible. I should check back though. Every series has a black sheep I guess.
[4:21:06] <+TOONFOOD> Disco E and Control are nominated in a buttload of game awards too which is kinda neat
[4:21:08] <%J_Papa> oh well... good
[4:21:08] <T_Sasquatch> Disco Elysium may as well be a book
[4:21:09] <Dutchpotato> @j_papa it got nominated for best action game
[4:21:10] <hairtoday> *baldur's gate 2
[4:21:11] <%Meidolaon> Sounds like the only butthurt one here is you m8 LUL LUL
[4:21:11] <+alexe76> best soundtrack as well
[4:21:12] <%Meow0369> Which it doesn't deserve
[4:21:13] <%trustycoyote> Action and soundtrack too i think
[4:21:13] <%AncelDeLambert> it deserves more than JUST best action
[4:21:15] <nevan0> seriously tho
[4:21:15] <beetbo2> DMCV is THE action game
[4:21:15] <narusao> dead god confirmed
[4:21:16] <waifoong98> God IS dead LUL
[4:21:16] <valriot> And Soundtrack
[4:21:18] <%Meidolaon> I'm havin' a blast LUL
[4:21:18] <ivansonic08> That's a statement
[4:21:20] <%Meow0369> Death stranding is obviously the best action game
[4:21:20] <dreu81> vga's are just a big dumb commercial anyway
[4:21:22] <%Meow0369> ever
[4:21:23] <@ShockzNDrawe> The best way to get pat interested in your thing, is to sandbag it as hard as possible and tell him it's terrible, and he will become interested in it purely out of spite
[4:21:23] <Belutima> Just buy all the VGA nominated games itmejpSMUG
[4:21:23] <%Explodincatz> as if those rewards matter
[4:21:24] <beetbo2> THE action game of the year
[4:21:24] <xxafrodragonxx> LUL
[4:21:26] <42nfl19> @AngriestPat What is it competing against?
[4:21:26] <pufferfishbones> hot pizza action
[4:21:27] <%SvenHolgersson> Was CODE Vein shit or no
[4:21:30] <dreu81> might as well nominated it for the schick hydrobot game of the year
[4:21:30] <%Kazuhira_Boat> Yo but is this snow also Timefall?
[4:21:30] <%Bailey__gaming> Is Slay the Spire on offer? I already own it. that ganes good
[4:21:32] <%AncelDeLambert> I still find it strange that Sekiro made the GotY list but not DMCV
[4:21:34] <kingra> GOD IS DEAD PogChamp
[4:21:35] <%DrFacilier> If DMCV does not win i will write a nasty letter to Kojima and say its from Geoff
[4:21:35] <ChrisM341> Everybody knows the best Action Game is Animal Crossing
[4:21:35] <pufferfishbones> ;)
[4:21:36] <Zombrocom> What other action games even happened this year?
[4:21:36] <MaeMae94> I couldn't get into character action games, but dmc5 actually made me like it, no justice if it doesn't wind that award
[4:21:36] <beetbo2> God'll be dead becuase Dante killed him
[4:21:38] <agumon9000> @AngriestPat Its a Pizza of course it will be
[4:21:39] <+Mistheart101> @CptHarlok dmc2 is like notoriously loathed by the fandom as a whole, i think
[4:21:40] <InXplotch> code vein sounded very medium
[4:21:40] <%Meow0369> Big pizza rough
[4:21:42] <valriot> #FuckSekiro though, I hope that doesn't win anything
[4:21:43] <+timmc916> God is Bread
[4:21:44] <T_Sasquatch> Tbh i say who cares about award shows and still get mad
[4:21:45] <beetbo2> in his quest for Pizza
[4:21:46] <%Meow0369> Fuck now I'm hungry
[4:21:46] <agumon9000> UNLESS YOU WANT TO DAMAGE IT
[4:21:46] <InXplotch> not bad but not outstanding
[4:21:47] <+cvp5127> @SvenHolgersson yes but fun shit
[4:21:47] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> ruff
[4:21:47] <heartlesshealer> Code Vein was fine
[4:21:47] <%MelBrooksKA> Portal 2 is apparently a dollar
[4:21:48] <%DonatelloJose> "God is dead, and the VGA killed him"
[4:21:48] <+RoughyID> God is already dead when God Hand fiasco happened
[4:21:50] <%StaceMcGate> @SvenHolgersson Aggresively average with a terrible plot, just play a regular souls game
[4:21:50] <+D00msDayDan> fortunately the one from the farm is the only one like that, the rest you can zip zam zoo
[4:21:51] <%tweedler92> Over 40 pizzas?
[4:21:51] <%WhereIsWill> apatBig PIZZA TIME
[4:21:52] <%nofestu2> This mission is going to be a PIZZA shit
[4:21:53] <%MoraMiarty> I'm still holding out hopes for vergil dlc. Or any dlc. Please, I want more dmcv content please I'm dying.
[4:21:58] <%Keyd00d> I hope Jump Force wins
[4:21:59] <waifoong98> no bread eat lead Kappa
[4:21:59] <%Meidolaon> God is probably a waifu LUL
[4:21:59] <+Dragon4234> @zombrocom Astral Chain
[4:22:00] <%Meow0369> This one is fine pat it's via car on the roads you built
[4:22:00] <pufferfishbones> he needs a BIG pizza
[4:22:00] <dreu81> sekiro also had its first teaser trailer at the vga's -- makes me do a big think
[4:22:00] <%tweedler92> In the last 30 days?
[4:22:04] <T_Sasquatch> Deathstranding will win goty and I'll be mad
[4:22:05] <%Keyd00d> I really do
[4:22:05] <Mendin> Remember Two Pizzas & Champagne, pat?
[4:22:05] <pufferfishbones> for his dying papa
[4:22:06] <CptHarlok> @Mistheart101 Glad it's not just me. Might have to pick the others up.
[4:22:06] <+LtSergei> I'm assuming that publishers only get one nomination for GOTY
[4:22:06] <%SvenHolgersson> Ah I'll wait til later then ty
[4:22:07] <%Meow0369> it'll take you about 5 minutes to deliver this one pat
[4:22:08] <InXplotch> whats wrong with sekiro? it seemed enjoyable when I played some of it
[4:22:14] <%TheMilhouseExperience> It’s enough to make an angel scream and the devil cry.
[4:22:14] <heartlesshealer> God Hand gave us that song though
[4:22:17] <%ThatOneGuyYouSaw> @AngriestPat remind Woolie that the Tsukihime anime doesn't exist
[4:22:17] <waifoong98> LUL keep hoping
[4:22:19] <Zombrocom> Sekiro was fine.
[4:22:19] <%StaceMcGate> Vergil announced for Power Rangers before DMC5
[4:22:22] <+silvery_cricket> I want Vergil and Dante to be announced for Smash together
[4:22:22] <+Dr_Mooose> not until DMC 5 special addition
[4:22:27] <%SWFanatic> God Hand 2: Gorilla Wrestler Edition
[4:22:29] <katocrimson> is this pizza mission
[4:22:30] <Nina96> wait for dmc 6
[4:22:35] <+timmc916> benis
[4:22:37] <ChrisM341> What happened to Bayonetta 3?
[4:22:39] <%Laecerelius> Can you recolor your santa hat to gold?

[4:22:46] <pufferfishbones> skeiro was dope
[4:22:47] <valriot> I can see DMC5 getting an Special Edition next year with Vergil Lady and Trish
[4:22:48] <InXplotch> did you show paige the hat?
[4:22:48] <+Mistheart101> if a vergil dlc comes out, woolie's gonna nut hard enough to knock a wall down
[4:22:50] <CptHarlok> Sekiro's great, it's just kinda one and done, so people stopped talking about it.
[4:22:51] <%Meidolaon> Bayo 3 still coming
[4:22:58] <%Bailey__gaming> @angriestpat will you stream the game awards this year? I hope for more fuck the Oscars shinnanigans
[4:22:59] <%Meidolaon> Just like Bayo herself Kappa
[4:23:01] <ivansonic08> Hoping for Dante in smash but how would he play?
[4:23:01] <silverira> it easier to hope for bayonetta 2 coming to pc
[4:23:07] <waifoong98> 7 years later, "we finally had the announcement gais" Kappa
[4:23:07] <%Ynkubus18> I would have liked the DMC5 Girls Night dlc to be real

[4:23:19] <+D00msDayDan> you're past the screen that shows you that
[4:23:19] <+Punchasaur> @meidolaon yeah, the fact that you said “who are you” after I made fun of the thing you like doesn’t point out your bitterness at all. Just keep spamming the lul emote. That’ll fool everyone.
[4:23:19] <heartlesshealer> has Paige seen the Santa since she came back?
[4:23:21] <+Solutha> didnt the 2nd need to be held at all times tho?

[4:23:51] <valriot> Sekiro is fun until you realise nothing matters but hitting L1 at the right time. It's basically a shitty rhythm game.

[4:24:04] <agumon9000> @AngriestPat Think about it like this. If you Zipline it then you'll get there before the pizza takes too much damage
[4:24:05] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> @AngriestPat keep it flat
[4:24:05] <coldsama> @angriestpat just updated Smite earlier today cause of your League tweets just to see how it went, aside from the terrible rip-off of characters and all that, they all have the same spells it's hilariously worse the more character you see, I can't believe is still going
[4:24:06] <%SaiyanShoto> The champagne one was the hardest one

[4:26:18] <beetbo2> for real, is it?
[4:26:19] <Kemmybelle> It's not bad.
[4:26:19] <duskrush> This road kinda sucks
[4:26:20] <+ultimafullmetal> It is. Norman Reedus is a cool and nice guy.
[4:26:20] <+D00msDayDan> product placement works way better when the product is actually good
[4:26:22] <+profanityincluded> but what is it about? is it like Jay Lenos garage?
[4:26:22] <Mendin> Yeah I watched S1E1 and it was fairly chill
[4:26:22] <T_Sasquatch> Sure it is
[4:26:22] <jorniev> IT IS?

[4:26:26] <+BloodyBurney> the inefficiency of this road layout rustles my jimmies
[4:26:26] <nevan0> it is...
[4:26:29] <Monkeyweed21> ITS JUST REEDUS GOING ON ROADTRIPS WITH FRIENDS
[4:26:30] <Dutchpotato> PogChamp
[4:26:33] <NeroInfinite> It's p.good, he tours with some of the old cast of The Walking Dead
[4:26:35] <FerwhateverDota> why does the motorcicle looks so funky to turn ?
[4:26:35] <%kewlmyc> It's just Norman going around on a bike to various biker hangouts. Sounds pretty chill
[4:26:36] <%SWFanatic> Deliver man a pizza once, deliver him pizza for a lifetime. Teach a man how to pizza, feed him for a lifetime.
[4:26:36] <Grennold> I didn't even get any shower adverts so I got to see Norman Reedus' frosted ass FeelsGoodMan
[4:26:37] <Dutchpotato> Now I wanna watch
[4:26:37] <eldragon_1> Well, if Suzi says so then it's true
[4:26:40] <%marsanta> He really likes bikes and visits local bike culture
[4:26:41] <katocrimson> there's also a similar show with ewan mcgregor
[4:26:41] <Mendin> Yeah it's just Reedus + Buddies hanging out and riding bikes
[4:26:42] <%Keyd00d> Can't be worse than that OTHER show
[4:26:43] <beetbo2> YOURE LOOKING AT RIDE WITH NORMAN REEDUS
[4:26:43] <%Meow0369> incoming unskippable BT warning cutscene killing the pacing
[4:26:44] <%LaughingCatt> If you can say one thing about Kojima, the man certainly knows what product to place
[4:26:44] <Namillus> @BloodyBurney It's a mountain road, shit be like that
[4:26:45] <+MurlinDurl> ghost roads SeemsGood
[4:26:46] <%Laecerelius> Reedus roadtrips? That sounds like fun.
[4:26:47] <@ShockzNDrawe> This game is stupid
[4:26:47] <%DonatelloJose> Norman doesn't appear in trash. ahem.
[4:26:47] <%WhereIsWill> ppl will watch norman reedus just cuz
[4:26:47] <ChrisM341> With Norman Reedus
[4:26:49] <%ThatOneGuyYouSaw> why can't he just make his own pizza?
[4:26:51] <MasterCosmic> How much are they paying you?
[4:26:51] <@ShockzNDrawe> I want it
[4:26:52] <%GeneralSCPatton> @murlindurl You would say that, Merle 'n Derle
[4:26:54] <Mister_McDerp> this is what peak performance looks like
[4:26:55] <%logoth_> no longer on power grid

[4:27:00] <+Darren716> Oh my god the show isnt actually caleld ride

[4:27:02] <dmtjinni> Pat youre my friend
[4:27:04] <beetbo2> RIDE WITH NORMAN REEDUS starring Hideo Kojumbo
[4:27:04] <%StaceMcGate> Why can't the chiral network deliver it for you?
[4:27:07] <+VoytekBus> i cannot wait for the ridiculous coplays of this character
[4:27:07] <Ipsenscastle> It's various celebrities riding Norman Reedus around
[4:27:08] <ShichiNoBushi> It must have salami.
[4:27:08] <KaliasTV> Why can't ghost roads fly in a straight line
[4:27:08] <zenith0111> @thatoneguyyousaw Because he's the biggest asshole in the whole game
[4:27:10] <%Meow0369> There's a reason
[4:27:10] <+Darren716> It is literally titled "Ride with Norman Reedus"
[4:27:12] <%xcompleasedad> IT'S WORTH IT
[4:27:12] <pufferfishbones> this pizzza is for his dying father
[4:27:13] <%Divryne> @AngriestPat You'll find out.
[4:27:14] <%SvenHolgersson> Its the only way he can get it up anymore
[4:27:14] <+LtSergei> he's fucking with you
[4:27:15] <+MurlinDurl> its just a prank bro Kappa
[4:27:15] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> LUL
[4:27:16] <+Mistheart101> dont worry about it
[4:27:16] <Mendin> Not everyone has a salami
[4:27:16] <+Darren716> the fuck
[4:27:16] <%Meow0369> an in lore explanation as to why pat
[4:27:17] <StarvingPenguinGod> LUL
[4:27:17] <%kewlmyc> He's challenging you
[4:27:17] <@ShockzNDrawe> to test your endurence
[4:27:17] <+MechaBaphomet> distance make it taste better
[4:27:17] <%Divryne> But not yet.
[4:27:19] <%AbnormalVoid> why indeed Kappa
[4:27:19] <waifoong98> Bc the smell of timefall rain hmmmmm
[4:27:19] <%SlimeSlimeSlime> The more the struggle, the tastier the treat
[4:27:20] <whittacre> all the local pizza is SHIT
[4:27:20] <%walternatorz> It's actually Higs ordering
[4:27:21] <%Laecerelius> You can't 3D print organics from the chiral network
[4:27:22] <%logoth_> - Entering Power Grid
[4:27:23] <jorniev> isnt the pizza tilted right now?
[4:27:24] <%SaiyanShoto> He must test your pizza skills
[4:27:24] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Delivering it with a truck would keep it flat
[4:27:24] <%cureneckbeard> He gets off on the power of forcing a guy to do dangerous work for him
[4:27:24] <+Solutha> cuz better ingredients better pizza
[4:27:24] <valriot> Kappa Kappa
[4:27:25] <CaptCatastrophe> Oh Pat youre gonna like that twist
[4:27:25] <s_snowball> tryin to get a taste of the world
[4:27:26] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat Did you make all these roads?
[4:27:27] <pufferfishbones> SHUT
[4:27:27] <blaggablag> Mountain Knot Salami man, don't knock it till you try it
[4:27:28] <%marsanta> Because it's funny to him
[4:27:28] <+timmc916> I hope pat crashes and the cum gets mixed in with the pizza
[4:27:28] <zenith0111> ACTUAL PIZZA LORE
[4:27:29] <%xcompleasedad> @AngriestPat It will be the most worth it in any Kojima game ever.
[4:27:29] <startstoprepeat> pizza tastes better when the driver has to work for it

[4:32:25] <%Ner234> Audio is fine. But it looks like a slideshow sometimes.
[4:32:25] <+brightman42> my pizza guy theory the whole time is that he's alone, clearly lying, and he's ordering from different places so they don't catch on that he subsists on pizza, other porters are also delivering most likely and he's just cycling everything so no one becomes the wiser
[4:32:26] <%0oki> I though I was the only one
[4:32:26] <heartlesshealer> yeah, it's only the visuals messing up

[4:34:22] <blaggablag> People are shitting pretty hard on this game on Metacritic
[4:34:23] <%rumtumtugnutz> This is an aggressive Jenga reboot.
[4:34:24] <Angry_Ev1L> the fuck is your problem with PIZZA?

[4:34:30] <pufferfishbones> pizza boy is best npc pizza boy is love
[4:34:32] <ChrisM341> The P in Pizza stands for Death Stranding
[4:34:33] <%thegreenbenis> Does die hardman even tip the delivery boy?
[4:34:34] <Neo_Kaiser> I hate how some BT areas are right next to roads so it always does that animation.
