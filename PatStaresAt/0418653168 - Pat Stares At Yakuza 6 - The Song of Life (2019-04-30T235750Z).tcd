[0:08:02] <%GeneralSCPatton> bleedpurple500 bonus50 Slight correction from the podcast. UV doesn't affect vampires. The sun's power is spiritual and tied to its symbolism. It's actually been strongly implied that a vamp in space far from the Earth would be completely unaffected, because the sun is no longer the symbolic entity that rises and sets to create day and night.

[0:08:38] <%Chatterbox1991> mrdestructoid500 So, if Sonic has furry hands, does that not also imply that he has furry feet? and if that's the case, doesn't that mean his feet would get matted in sweat if he ran long enough? Can you imagine what it would be like if you slowly ran your hand down Sonic's sweaty, sticky fur feet? Can you imagine placing your tongue on it and tasteing the thick, sticky, sweat stein furry feet? You ever smell a wet dog before. does it smell worse with Sonic? Am i making you uncomfortable?

[0:13:12] <derap41> Did they make sonic weirdly proportional so they could mocap him properly?
[0:13:12] <+Rachet20> I hope Ben Schwartz at least kills it as Sonic. I love that man.
[0:13:15] <dawnengel> jim carrey has gotten really fucking weird in his old age

[0:13:19] <%spiritofmojave> he's just weird
[0:13:20] <dayspring815> Well, it's meant to stop people to root for Robotnik, because no one's gonna root for Sanic
[0:13:23] <+pmme0bama> Is Jim Carry Anti-vaxx? I think I heard something like that
[0:13:23] <ItsDeans> I'm uncomfortable hearing about it.
[0:13:28] <admiral_of_crunch> Hmm... Y'know Truman Show was good and I don't need to think about crazy Jim Carrey as a person.
[0:13:28] <@lewdskeletor13> I wonder if Jim method acted Eggman
[0:13:30] <%Fadedblank247> he lost his mind on the kick ass 2 set apparently as well

[0:14:35] <admiral_of_crunch> Dang guys, just watch things in order and skip the bad ones
[0:14:35] <%sshen> Black Panther kinda?
[0:14:35] <burntbread98> I kept thinking to myself why wasn’t gangsters paradise used in pat 5s ending
[0:14:38] <Sloavon> the good ones
[0:14:39] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You can't skip Iron Man3.
[0:14:42] <marvel877> Oh, wait Captain Marvel, yeah, skip that.
[0:14:44] <TheZombiepope> My gf just watched Thor:Ragnarok and Guardians
[0:14:44] <reonome> you need IM3
[0:14:45] <ItsDeans> Fucking Jim Carrey sounds like hes actually under the influence of the Mask
[0:14:45] <%rumtumtugnutz> Yeah that's fair
[0:14:45] <+Ell1ot> How come Sonic can't dodge a dart from a dart gun but time stops when a million rockets fly at him?
[0:14:46] <Jigglebounce> You can skip ant man
[0:14:46] <thesassyskeleton> When will the marks come out
[0:14:47] <$SGrim> @El_Desperad0 Antman and Wasp is slightly important
[0:14:47] <+Rachet20> They’re all cool except Thor 2 so watch them all
[0:14:48] <derap41> only the one with the Pinocchio robot
[0:14:48] <Liquid_Dio> Skip Thor 2 and Captain Marvel

[0:14:52] <+dukenux> Watch mainline Avengers: there
[0:14:53] <%Valison> Skip Both antman movies
[0:14:53] <Ion_Laser> You do not need to see Thor: The Dark World or Iron Man 2
[0:14:54] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Captain Marvel is like, a direct lead-in.
[0:14:55] <reonome> you need CIVIL WAR
[0:14:55] <%spiritofmojave> just skip Capt. Marvel, Thor 2 maybe
[0:14:55] <%riantDeliration> if it has a 2 you can probably skip it
[0:14:55] <DracaenaLeaf> you can skip captain marvel even though it's a good film
[0:14:55] <%MisterRockett> Ant Man and the Wasp 2 is probably necessary.
[0:14:57] <burntbread98> Captain marvel
[0:14:57] <@lewdskeletor13> Watch the Avengers and Captain America movies and Ragnarok
[0:14:58] <GoldeNOVA> Watch Thor Ragnarok FOR SURE
[0:14:59] <%Shadowthedigger> What's between Guardians 1 and Endgame?
[0:15:00] <MSN04_Sazabi> Ant-Man, Black Panther, Dr Strange, Thor 2 (but not Ragnarok)
[0:15:01] <%MisterRockett> Thor Ragnarok.
[0:15:01] <BallinArbiter> All the captain americas
[0:15:02] <VanLynx> Don't skip Ragnarok
[0:15:03] <%Kataguro> Thor 3?
[0:15:04] <%GohanEgret> fuck that, I haven't seen anything except for some of Iron Man 1, I stand no chance
[0:15:05] <TwinBat> this is bad advice pat
[0:15:09] <admiral_of_crunch> @Ell1ot Because chaos control obviously
[0:15:09] <%ECRead> i haven't watched any after the first Avengers
[0:15:09] <%BlancoRico> thor ragnarok

[0:15:13] <BunnyEmperor> lmao
[0:15:16] <%AncelDeLambert> no fuck that I value my LIFE
[0:15:17] <%Order_of_Mystery> Thor 2 sucks
[0:15:19] <%valriot> Captain Marvel is NOT a lead in, its completely irrelevant to the events
[0:15:20] <@lewdskeletor13> Ragnarok leads right into IE
[0:15:21] <Nina96> U can skip captain marvel tbh
[0:15:21] <%sshen> Only the last minute of antman and the wasp is needed
[0:15:22] <%Too_Much_Nukie> This is very bad advice, you'll be very confused if you don't at least no characters.
[0:15:22] <+d00msdaydan> the correct answer is watch them all fuck you
[0:15:22] <@lewdskeletor13> IW
[0:15:25] <+dukenux> Honestly you can skip Dr Strange
[0:15:25] <+kludd1366> Cory in the house is essential
[0:15:26] <%MrSuperCasualBoom> Endgame Spoilers: Cyclops and Ryu come in and shakes hands to create X-Men vs Street Fighter
[0:15:29] <ミュウレ4242> the new superheroes are mostly terrible. just read the comics.
[0:15:30] <BunnyEmperor> Don't ask Pat for advice is the advice
[0:15:32] <+spiceyweasle> the ones with the stones are probably the most important

[0:15:43] <General_Terro> all at once
[0:15:44] <CptBritches> Neither of those are depressing
[0:15:44] <%rumtumtugnutz> To be fair, though, skip Iron Man 2, Thor 2, Avengers 2, and everything else is kinda important.
[0:15:45] <%manwithboxonhead> Happy Birthday
[0:15:45] <InugamiTheHound> happy birthday!!!
[0:15:45] <%Remery_> Like killing Hiji ;/

[0:15:47] <+mugwugsampoo> FeelsBirthdayMan
[0:15:49] <%spiritofmojave> That makes it better
[0:15:50] <CastellanVon> You can skip Hulk, Thor 2, Captain Marvel, Iron Man 2, at least.
[0:15:51] <twistedj3ster> shitting your cube would be funny

[0:16:07] <BoneofMalkav> LUL
[0:16:09] <count_bob> If you die on stream, you'll shit yourself.

[0:16:15] <%blastazoid26> I missed it too
[0:16:16] <%manwithboxonhead> Dying and taking a shit would be the worst.
[0:16:17] <twistedj3ster> I ALSO MISSED IT
[0:16:17] <mightyfat> Ragnarok is not great if you’re a fan of the comics
[0:16:19] <The_500lb_Child> It was a mental block

[0:17:44] <%weissguard> Don't you need a Stone for that?
[0:17:44] <Ion_Laser> there was fine print to the curse
[0:17:46] <+dukenux> All those curses bouncing off Woolie...
[0:17:48] <BallinArbiter> It’s a bio curse
[0:17:48] <@lewdskeletor13> Real advice on the MCU: Watch Avengers, Winter Soldier, Guardians 1, Age of Ultron, Civil War, Dr Strange, and Thor Ragnarok. You can skip the rest
[0:17:50] <+dukenux> what have we done
[0:17:51] <%rumtumtugnutz> I'm disappointed the cop's name isn't miles Prower.
[0:17:51] <%valriot> El Diablo haunts Paiges flesh

[0:18:06] <$Brother_Coduss> and all thye other curses cancel each other out, but undoing one makes them all kick in double time

[0:18:15] <KohryuZX> to be honest someone who played first out of everything Zero would be hit pretty hard by Kiwami 1 seeing how the characters die
[0:18:16] <admiral_of_crunch> Man, remember when we cursed Woolie? Remember how we did such an awful job the channel ended? Hah! Curses
[0:18:16] <%MrSuperCasualBoom> Paige Multicurse Universe.
[0:18:21] <Ion_Laser> @rumtumtugnutz the movie will probably crowbar that name in somewhere
[0:18:23] <+Story_Ark> guardians 2 as well
[0:18:24] <%sshen> It was 20minutes ago pat
[0:18:24] <MSN04_Sazabi> You can skip Age of Ultron. Honestly, you could probably even skip Civil War.
[0:18:25] <grimdogx> Does Sonic actually go fast or is he just teleporting?
[0:18:26] <%Cynful_Zebra> I do my best <3

[0:26:21] <%valriot> SHES RIGHT
[0:26:21] <Ion_Laser> The only good thing about that Sonic trailer is that Coolio better be getting royalties for Gangsta's Paradise
[0:26:23] <%spiritofmojave> Naps are amazing if you leave your window open
[0:26:25] <grayjammer> Paige is correct

[0:38:22] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @AncelDeLambert Funfact: Kiryu can't do his smoking heat move in this game because smoking on the street is illegal in Japan now.
[0:38:22] <+ElEversoris> gib cigarettes lionBaby
[0:38:23] <T_Sasquatch> @devanmuse they already smoke , you think they are smart enough to care about a baby
[0:38:24] <%spiritofmojave> He wants to get that power smoke
[0:38:24] <+absolute_cagemony> Give the cigarette to the baby to use as a pacifier
[0:38:24] <%weissguard> That would be more adorable if this dude wasn't smoking.
[0:38:28] <Sloavon> what was that X button prompt?
[0:38:32] <starotter70> The baby is gonna have a tattoo, isn't he?
[0:38:32] <$Valdorick> "No no, I'm 100% thug"
[0:38:32] <mayorrev> He's honest

[0:38:36] <Basch71> steal this yakuza baby
[0:38:37] <%LuckyLagomorph> LUL
[0:38:37] <%spiritofmojave> LUL

[0:38:43] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> the X is just to skip the dialogue
[0:38:44] <Ion_Laser> :D
[0:38:44] <%Wallabri> Kiryu? LIE????
[0:38:44] <%weissguard> He's WEARING blue.
[0:38:47] <Nina96> It is his grandson though
[0:38:47] <devanmuse> @alexandrecau the casual infant endangerment certainly isn't helping the population/birthrate issue
[0:38:47] <%CappuccinoGuil> And hey, it really is his fucking grandson
[0:38:49] <BoneofMalkav> LUL
[0:38:50] <InugamiTheHound> no he can't disgrace his honor.
[0:38:51] <starotter70> Yes
[0:38:52] <+dukenux> Kiryu needs a proof
[0:38:53] <%theAncopro> please understand
[0:38:53] <%Over_ninek> it's a huge stigma pat
[0:38:54] <%PokemonTrainer> Kiryus too hot to be a grandpa
[0:38:55] <falconx9k> ZOOM
[0:38:55] <+ElEversoris> it's the only crime he's really ever done
[0:38:56] <kerotuyu> Is Kiryu not infamous to Yakuza everywhere, by now?
[0:38:56] <fearhurst> Fuck, why is sonic's hair electrical now
[0:38:56] <CrimKangaroo> but at least people don´t throw their buts in the street like they do here in spain
[0:38:56] <MC_GigglePants> Plus it is his grandson
[0:38:58] <alexandrecau> Kiryu is thorough in his truth
[0:39:01] <joneworldbeater> Yakuza is a serious crime simulator
[0:39:01] <+dukenux> woah
[0:39:02] <%SilvaChariot0133> Whoa
[0:39:02] <+il_barbiero> hey I STOLE this BABY okay cool lmao let's fight
[0:39:03] <@lewdskeletor13> He’s HONORABLE pat
[0:39:03] <starotter70> Ok, hey there Kiryu
[0:39:04] <worldbrand> hi i am an ex-yakuza baby thief
[0:39:04] <GarrisonAirRaid> nice cut
[0:39:07] <natebud> Kiryu should have been in the Sonic movie
[0:39:07] <ShichiNoBushi> He didn't think to show him the picture?
[0:39:08] <alcors_wisdom> as easy as stealing a baby from a hospital
[0:39:08] <silverira> it is his irst actual crime
[0:39:09] <$Brother_Coduss> @AngriestPat he doesnt want to ruin haruto's life like he did haruka
[0:39:10] <bleugh> kiryuu is above lies and trickery
[0:39:11] <%spiritofmojave> Haruka is his daughter by this point, but Haruto isn't his grandkid vineThink
[0:39:11] <$cureneckbeard> Kiryu never lies. Lying isn't honourable
[0:39:14] <Futurecity10> we need to see his PORES
[0:39:15] <%PokemonTrainer> Drop the baby.
[0:39:15] <alexandrecau> gaze in the eye of Kiryu
[0:39:15] <%CappuccinoGuil> I have a BIG issue with Kiryu not accepting Haruto as his grandson, because by proxy, it means he doesn't recognize Haruka as his kid.
[0:39:16] <%Too_Much_Nukie> He never _actually_ adopted Haruka though so Haruto is only his grandson in spirit.
[0:39:18] <%HuskyGreene> Kiryu is honest to a fault
[0:39:21] <simulationbard> Why won't he say it's his grandson. IT IS HIS GRANDSON. It's Haruka's kid isn't it
[0:39:23] <%manwithboxonhead> cheer100 Don’t be like Mallory Archer...Or do so...
[0:39:27] <+mcjimbo12> Wait, we're this guy's aniki now? What did I miss?
[0:39:29] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Haruka is not his daughter.
[0:39:35] <Dest_121> he never adopted haruka @simulationbard
[0:39:36] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Bye Okuyasu
[0:39:37] <%KevinsLunchbox> when is he going to throw the baby through the air to distract someone he is fighting where they catch the baby and he drop kicks them
[0:39:39] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Kiryu didn't actually adopt her, because he is an idiot.
[0:39:39] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> hai mommy
[0:39:39] <%Niney_Who> TAKE THIS BABY
[0:39:39] <%lovebass4stuff> anime mom!!!!
[0:39:42] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> I hope he's just slow playing this.
[0:39:46] <%logoth_> This baby is not mine I stole it random woman
[0:39:46] <%Over_ninek> If Kiryu acknowledges Haruto as his relation it super fucks up his life for decades to come
[0:39:47] <+il_barbiero> kiryu just flinging haruto through the bad guy's chest
[0:39:50] <fearhurst> @angriestpat Sonic turned into Blanka, Woolie should watch it and review on the Podcast
[0:39:51] <%theAncopro> die again
[0:39:51] <%CappuccinoGuil> @mcjimbo12 that dude got beau up and we saved him, then he bled on our white pants until we accepted being his Aniki
[0:39:52] <@lewdskeletor13> @mcjimbo12 Kiryu impressed this guy by being a badass
[0:39:52] <+ElEversoris> Haruka might as well be his fucking daughter tho
[0:39:53] <mayorrev> That's the same red shirt from the thumbs up gif yeah?
[0:39:54] <natebud> Also before you go, did I mention this isn't my baby?
[0:39:54] <+burritocheetos> ah shit here we go again
[0:39:55] <$Mendin> @rcoinuwu Kiryu beat up some other yakuzies who were harassing that guy, so he did a speedwagon
[0:39:56] <bleugh> can you do tag team moves with the baby?
[0:39:56] <T_Sasquatch> kiryu is still a virgin right ?
[0:39:58] <%PokemonTrainer> Stab them then kick the stab
[0:39:58] <alcors_wisdom> fair enough
[0:39:58] <falconx9k> Haruto needs to learn
[0:40:03] <TheMrTwisted> when are you gonna use the baby in a heat move?
[0:40:03] <$cureneckbeard> Does she only own the one dress
[0:40:08] <alcors_wisdom> @falconx9k he most learn the way of the blade
[0:40:08] <starotter70> @T_Sasquatch Yup
[0:40:09] <joneworldbeater> "I guess that's true"
[0:40:12] <+RogueCrocodile> @il_barbiero like goddamn ferra torr
[0:40:13] <%ThatGuyfromMars> man that baby is just chillin out
[0:40:17] <%dave323dave> teach haruto beast style
[0:40:17] <$cureneckbeard> Does Kiryu just have a suitcase full of identical red shirts
[0:40:19] <@lewdskeletor13> Show Haruto how to do Heat moves
[0:40:21] <%Davenofport> just leave the baby on the floor
[0:40:22] <+mcjimbo12> CappuccinoGuil lewdskeletor13 thanks friends i think i missed the last few hours of a stream or something monkaS
[0:40:22] <$Brother_Coduss> @cureneckbeard work uniform?
[0:40:24] <%Kataguro> Ew, coin grime
[0:40:27] <T_Sasquatch> @starotter70 NotLikeThis sigh
[0:40:27] <%theAncopro> fuck these alleys, lets go to the top of a tourist spot
[0:40:28] <alexandrecau> @T_Sasquatch he totally fucked that police girl in 2, now he evolved to porn chat like a true japanese
[0:40:29] <PortableBoredom> People will make offerings to the baby, it'll be fine
[0:40:29] <fearhurst> Shove the baby in the amnesty box
[0:40:30] <Nina96> Does Kiryu know what sex is yet?
[0:40:30] <%PokemonTrainer> Can you jump off a building with the baby?!
[0:40:32] <natebud> @T_Sasquatch not if the yakuza 0 phone game is any indicator
[0:40:34] <simulationbard> @Dest_121 Yeah but didn't he basically rase her as his own kid anyways.
[0:40:35] <%Gatzarlok> Telling Kiryu about your problems is like hiring a hitman in some instances
[0:40:35] <BoneofMalkav> Something's fishy about this
[0:40:36] <+dukenux> so sae to run with a baby like that
[0:40:37] <%HuskyGreene> Quick! Now ditch her for side stories
[0:40:45] <%PokemonTrainer> Jump off a building with the baby!
[0:40:46] <+BishopBain> Is this woman going to betray you?
[0:40:49] <+Vikingdeath1> No she HAS to say it at the Shrine!
[0:40:49] <+dukenux> safe
[0:40:50] <%KevinsLunchbox> blue dress
[0:40:51] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Is "San" only used with surnames, or with given names as well?
[0:40:51] <joneworldbeater> Like, "Oh, shit, I forgot babies don't do well in brutal street fights."
[0:40:52] <+BishopBain> I feel like she's going to betray you.
[0:40:53] <derap41> hint hint paige
[0:40:54] <devanmuse> These guys are looking for you. Follow me to this isolated location where nobody will hear screams. This is certainly not a trap.
[0:40:55] <mayorrev> @AngriestPat When does Kiryu throw the baby
[0:40:56] <%Over_ninek> wut
[0:40:57] <$RaikenTB> Nice blue dress.
[0:40:59] <+dukenux> Pat likes purple
[0:40:59] <$Brother_Coduss> her gamecube purple dress
[0:41:00] <$Valdorick> Get into a fight, then tag the baby in, and 'pacify' some bitches.
[0:41:00] <Grandune> A nice shade of blue
[0:41:00] <SomersaultJustice> throw the baby at them as a distraction
[0:41:05] <natebud> That baby is the Yomei Alliance
[0:41:08] <alcors_wisdom> "kiryu you want me to hold haruto while you rail me against a shrine, i'm going through menopause RIGHT NOW"
[0:41:09] <+absolute_cagemony> When will kiryu learn a HEAT MOVE that involves the BABY?
[0:41:09] <+ElEversoris> this baby is a yomei alliance member
[0:41:13] <%AncelDeLambert> here WOMAN, do your womanly job and hold this baby
[0:41:13] <%Davenofport> hold this baby while i murder these men with my bare hands
[0:41:19] <T_Sasquatch> @alexandrecau yup nothing like sex with the man that killed your bro for no reason
[0:41:19] <Nina96> isnt the dress purple?
[0:41:22] <%Piemen99> How far is pat into the game?
[0:41:22] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @AngriestPat You should do substories before you leave this town by the way. But you have plenty of time so there's no rush.
[0:41:24] <%spiritofmojave> It'd be funny if Kiryu said that to some random still
[0:41:28] <BunnyEmperor> CHAINSAW KICKU
[0:41:32] <ミュウレ4242> as long as syou remember essence of repeating knee.
[0:41:33] <%Over_ninek> the lack of Jackie Chan stunts makes me sad

[0:43:57] <%spiritofmojave> ADVANCED GRANDPA
[0:43:57] <%stabbityrabbit> I imagine the baby is going to grow up and find the smell of blood pleasing. He'll subconsciously associate it with the safety Kiryu provided during his infancy.
[0:43:58] <Nina96> time to die gobbers
[0:43:58] <BunnyEmperor> You're already dead
[0:43:58] <alexandrecau> Imagine your calling card is the you carry a baby like beelzebub

[0:44:07] <mayorrev> DEAD
[0:44:13] <MC_GigglePants> You would think these guys would know that Kiryu has beat the shit out of 1 million people before now

[0:44:48] <%mastertwin2> Kiryu, now total GILF status
[0:44:49] <%manwithboxonhead> apatFist apatFist apatFist
[0:44:49] <RichAnvils> Watch out! HE's A DILF
[0:44:51] <%Deekman> They're 1 step away from doing Mortal Kombats xray moves
[0:44:52] <%Over_ninek> i really hope in 15~ years of game time we get to have a Banchou game starring Haruto
[0:44:53] <%PokemonTrainer> Just stop passing the baby
[0:44:55] <%weissguard> LUL
[0:44:57] <majima666> every game should have a powerbomb feature
[0:44:57] <%SvenHolgersson> Throw the baby Pat
[0:44:58] <SomersaultJustice> does kiryu like, chew the guys's dick after the powerbomb and that's why there's a triangle mash prompt?
[0:44:59] <falconx9k> You go this way, I'll go home
[0:44:59] <alcors_wisdom> shes getting super moist from kiryu destroying these thugs
[0:44:59] <%logoth_> people just walking into the passed out goons
[0:45:02] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @Over_ninek Me too.
[0:45:02] <+ElEversoris> Kiryu is a mega dilf
[0:45:09] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> Why did he take the baby with him
[0:45:18] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> Could he not just hire a baby sitter?
[0:45:20] <PortableBoredom> Does Pat already know the story to Yakuza 6?
[0:45:21] <mayorrev> STOP
[0:45:24] <%PokemonTrainer> You’re the only one in town with a baby
[0:45:25] <+dukenux> Just watch this couple with a baby on a stroll getting attacked by goons
[0:45:25] <fearhurst> He's pulling their legs down
[0:45:25] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> he's a BAD boy
[0:45:26] <%manwithboxonhead> Hey Girls are watching so get good!
[0:45:26] <alcors_wisdom> you drop the D in GILF damn it
[0:45:27] <%Jetsfantasy> I hate slow NPC's so much. Faster than walking, slower than running
[0:45:27] <natebud> Kiryu is a BAD boy
[0:45:29] <official_nakmatic> I'm not Gay, buy Kiryu is kinda sexy KappaPride
[0:45:29] <%Over_ninek> HONOR
[0:45:32] <@lewdskeletor13> Date and Kage are jealous of all the GILF energy Kiryu has now
[0:45:33] <lloyddboy> so bab ydon't get adopted
[0:45:33] <%SvenHolgersson> Grandma Daughter?
[0:45:35] <$Mofirelizard> the baby
[0:45:35] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @Youwereeatenbyalid sure just get a baby sitter to watch the stolen baby
[0:45:37] <+millionstabz> The baby is evidence
[0:45:37] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @PortableBoredom No this is his first time playing and he was not spoiled.
[0:45:38] <$Valdorick> Why is still holding the baby when he knows he's just going to get into fights - keep the baby on the lady, Kiryu!
[0:45:39] <SparkAfterDark> In case he needs it for a heat move
[0:45:39] <%Deekman> Responsibility
[0:45:40] <%PokemonTrainer> Why does he keep taking the baby bacj
[0:45:40] <Nina96> @majima666 even tetris?
[0:45:46] <%shiplord13> Could have left the baby with Date
[0:45:47] <%CappuccinoGuil> @Sir_Gawain_Lotsson he is the goodest boy around cryGrump
[0:45:47] <fearhurst> He's so strong that the baby isnt in danger
[0:45:48] <PortableBoredom> @Too_Much_Nukie Nice
[0:45:50] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> @ThatGuyfromMars he didn't steal it though.
[0:45:52] <%NopeBadguy> @AngriestPat i bet he thought akiyama and date were both too jobbery to defend the baby LUL
[0:45:52] <%Deekman> It can't be helped
[0:45:53] <%spiritofmojave> Babysitters are in short supply in Japanland sugoiSmugsnake
[0:45:54] <InugamiTheHound> protection agency.
[0:45:54] <%Remery_> Sit it on the ground
[0:45:54] <%Tearonex> Kid needs to watch the beatdowns
[0:45:55] <%SvenHolgersson> Baby lives here now
[0:45:57] <fruit_pie_the_magician> You KNOW the instant he leaves that baby alone it's getting kidnapped
[0:45:58] <majima666> especially tetris
[0:45:59] <$Brother_Coduss> what are those statues called?
[0:46:00] <%PokemonTrainer> Abandon the baby
[0:46:00] <$Mendin> Pat if they left babbo behind, babby would get kidnapped and then Kiryu would have to Kill Eveyone
[0:46:01] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> @ThatGuyfromMars the police just let him have it
[0:46:04] <%manwithboxonhead> apatFist apatFist apatFist
[0:46:05] <%Omegaanimus> If only Kiryu had a place to keep a baby that doesn't have a parent around
[0:46:09] <omen_setter> the baby has been left as an offering
[0:46:09] <%Gatzarlok> With how long the baby has been around Kiryu, it's too powerful for a baby sitter.
[0:46:10] <%Omegaanimus> some sort of place for Orphans
[0:46:11] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> @CappuccinoGuil BAD = Bad-Ass Dad in that Yakuzie 1 side story
[0:46:12] <fearhurst> The baby is safest in his arm, like a laundry bag
[0:46:12] <alexandrecau> Oh yes sidequest start after that i think
[0:46:12] <%MoraMiarty> why is he worried about this bumpkin crime family
[0:46:14] <+dukenux> Yeah leave the baby at the temple. People do that all the time.
[0:46:15] <%Omegaanimus> an Orphanarium
[0:46:18] <hntronium> Baby on floor is unsanitary
[0:46:18] <%Divryne> HE KNEW.
[0:46:19] <+Andrizzleton> baby is learning the way
[0:46:19] <$Valdorick> … Or maybe Kiryu forgot to put the xp share on the baby, so needs to enter fights with him out, so he can get the xp to learn HEAT MOVES
[0:46:21] <SomersaultJustice> it was nishki's ghost all along
[0:46:21] <reonome> ayyy he's not that dumb
[0:46:22] <@lewdskeletor13> I wonder if Kiryu will legit kill anyone in this story
[0:46:22] <%shiplord13> Hey wheres the baby?
[0:46:23] <$HentaiSenpai9K> I can't wait till the rugby scene
[0:46:23] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Haruto DID already do his first heat move.
[0:46:23] <%MoraMiarty> hes beaten much larger tougher yakuza
[0:46:23] <derap41> Put apple in the bowl to get a see
[0:46:29] <+zaworldo> o h
[0:46:30] <+zaworldo> O H
[0:46:33] <%theAncopro> thank god
[0:46:34] <%CJett92> What a twist!
[0:46:34] <%Jetsfantasy> Kiryu has to keep a close eye on his stolen property, or else the feds will come and take it back
[0:46:35] <+Vikingdeath1> Kiryu BIG Smart!
[0:46:37] <President_valentine> See Kiryu ain't THAT dumb
[0:46:38] <mayorrev> awwww
[0:46:39] <+burritocheetos> KIRYU IS SMART
[0:46:41] <applesonthemoon> the baby has to see kiryu fight so he can say "THAT'S RAD" and learn his fighting style
[0:46:41] <%manwithboxonhead> The Baby needs to learn the way of the apatFist
[0:46:42] <silverira> he is only half stupid
[0:46:45] <+millionstabz> Kiryu is dumb but he
[0:46:45] <starotter70> Kiryu is SMRT
[0:46:45] <CrimKangaroo> nah, @shiplord13 , he remembers what happened when he left Haruka with Date.
[0:46:47] <Nina96> "SMART"
[0:46:49] <alexandrecau> Kiryu is not dumb he has dumb principles
[0:46:50] <%spiritofmojave> Kiryu is only half dumb
[0:46:51] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Kiryu isn't as dumb as he seems. He's still dumb, but he's not that dumb. More naive than anything.
[0:46:51] <%NopeBadguy> kiryu ate his flintstones vitamin gummies today
[0:46:51] <+millionstabz> HE's dumb but he's not an idiot
[0:46:52] <+il_barbiero> magical child
[0:46:52] <+Deano8817> Kiryu is trying
[0:46:52] <@lewdskeletor13> He’s only kind of dumb!
[0:46:53] <+dukenux> Merely pretending to be dense
[0:46:59] <AMajorTom> Kiryu is basically Columbo.
[0:46:59] <+ElEversoris> Kiryu is street smart
[0:47:01] <fearhurst> Kiryu big think, teach baby to count to 7
[0:47:03] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> kiryu is a smart man who lives by stupid rules
[0:47:04] <Desertfishing> i bet they hit her with the car
[0:47:07] <PkSilent01> wiping your butt on stream?
[0:47:07] <$RaikenTB> Maybe they don't want you to beat them to death.
[0:47:08] <mayorrev> baby wipe that controller
[0:47:08] <%PokemonTrainer> Baby wipes
[0:47:10] <SparkAfterDark> Actually yeah that's a good point. If the baby is far away he can't protect it. The baby is literally safer in kiryu's hands even if a thousand people are about to fight kiryu
[0:47:11] <a_mad_dragon> yes pat, baby-wipe the red bull
[0:47:11] <%KevinsLunchbox> wait is Haruka dead or something?
[0:47:13] <sphereshots12> Took him 5 games to realize this
[0:47:13] <+il_barbiero> you FOOLS, I was only PRETENDING to be stupid! Ha HAA
[0:47:17] <SomersaultJustice> cleanse the cube
[0:47:18] <T_Sasquatch> kiryu is not street smart LUL, he's fight smart
[0:47:18] <reonome> kiryu they'll tell you if you just beat them up
[0:47:21] <InugamiTheHound> they got her drunk and fucked her
[0:47:21] <%SvenHolgersson> All of them are the dad
[0:47:22] <alcors_wisdom> naw hes the big bad's squeeze
[0:47:25] <+millionstabz> Yeah that would be awkward
[0:47:25] <%maybefalco> what if theyre ALL the dad
[0:47:28] <Nina96> @AngriestPat they are all the dad
[0:47:29] <alexandrecau> @KevinsLunchbox hit by a car, coma
[0:47:29] <%MisterRockett> LUL LUL LUL LUL LUL
[0:47:31] <Futurecity10> @KevinsLunchbox Haruka got ran over and is in ICU
[0:47:31] <+Andrizzleton> Haruka Gaiden when?
[0:47:32] <%theAncopro> beat takeshi what sdid you DO
[0:47:32] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> Holy shit
[0:47:34] <%KevinsLunchbox> oh
[0:47:35] <alcors_wisdom> fuck off kiryu you are the worst lair in the world
[0:47:35] <$cureneckbeard> What if none of them know which is the dad
[0:47:36] <CrimKangaroo> ahhh columbo, damn i loved that show
[0:47:40] <+dukenux> Kiryu can't act so he doesn't lie
[0:47:42] <fearhurst> Haruka has two dads now
[0:47:47] <reonome> BUT WHY
[0:47:48] <%valriot> Watch noone be the dad and the baby is actually a Rubber Baby
[0:47:49] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> Kiryu doesn't lie be cause he knows he's bad at it. What a hero.
[0:47:50] <%Omegaanimus> Why doesn't Kiryu just say "Yes I am the baby's grandfather" instead of "No" with zero follow up or clarification?
[0:47:53] <%dave323dave> aww
[0:47:53] <falconx9k> Awww
[0:47:53] <%Davenofport> i feel like kiryu doesnt form thoughts very often
[0:47:58] <alcors_wisdom> kiryu no
[0:47:59] <%Mikaelsoh1> Mikaelsoh1 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! 
[0:48:01] <%spiritofmojave> aw
[0:48:01] <+absolute_cagemony> Im gonna start a youtube channel called AngriestFat... where i'm fat and angry...
[0:48:02] <$cureneckbeard> lying would be dishonourable
[0:48:03] <falconx9k> Love those knuckleheads
[0:48:05] <starotter70> It's weird seeing Kiryu Smile
[0:48:05] <reonome> KIRYU PLS
[0:48:05] <%Deekman> There's only 3 people that know who the dad is :-P
[0:48:07] <SparkAfterDark> @Omegaanimus Because lying is a crime and crime is wrong
[0:48:07] <alcors_wisdom> you said you'd stop being a yakuza
[0:48:08] <%Gatzarlok> Kiryu going for the easiest option would ruin 90% of these games
[0:48:10] <alexandrecau> Kiryu likes dumb pure yakuzie
[0:48:11] <BunnyEmperor> kiryu likes liars
[0:48:12] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Kiryu has an affinity for pathetic stray children.
[0:48:13] <%Over_ninek> What if the dad is Kazuga Ichiban
[0:48:14] <%theAncopro> Kiryu big smart but he likes big dumb
[0:48:15] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> Kill them all kiryu
[0:48:16] <%Jetsfantasy> Koichi runs a bar?
[0:48:17] <fearhurst> Someone else's child
[0:48:19] <+kojibeoulve> LUL
[0:48:23] <%Niney_Who> gimme FREEDOM
[0:48:24] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> kill them all and let god sort them out
[0:48:24] <alexandrecau> They are honest liar
[0:48:24] <%Omegaanimus> Does Kiryu have internal thoughts? Or are all of the thoughts he speaks aloud his entire thought process?
[0:48:25] <alcors_wisdom> booze the baby
[0:48:30] <+griffball13> make sure the baby gets his beer
[0:48:31] <starotter70> I don't want to take care of it
[0:48:31] <Ion_Laser> feed the baby beer. I don't care
[0:48:32] <+dukenux> Kiryu found a group of people that are worse at being Yakuza than him!
[0:48:33] <$Valdorick> The real reason is he knows if he tried to force them to tell him, he'd just break their spines or something.
[0:48:36] <InugamiTheHound> she's baby crazy
[0:48:36] <alcors_wisdom> kiryu really likes leaving small childern at bars huh
[0:48:40] <%Davenofport> what does she do if haruto gets hungry
[0:48:40] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> oh man, what if the bar lady sells him out super hard
[0:48:41] <Nina96> I thought it said Morioh for a sec
[0:48:42] <+ElEversoris> hey I know I met you yesterday but here have this baby

[1:01:02] <ShichiNoBushi> It's one of the few things you can legally gamble on in Japan. Slots and pachinko only reward tokens and ball that are exchanged for prizes which are just sold back next door.

[2:32:59] <%Kirby_Sauce> @Rincewind1998 errr.... try looking into the shady shit most us companies do. Nestle poisoned the water supply of a town so they could sell more waterbottles, then bribed the local government into letting them do it.

[2:35:05] <%spiritofmojave> Remember the Thirty Years War anime OPs guys
[2:35:06] <+chaumiester> Tentacle Porn is 400+ years old
[2:35:06] <Ominnous> Jesus is the first idol
[2:35:06] <TheBlankAce> Its a lot of cause and effect, the same reason why hentai is popularized because Japan had regular porn banned for a while.
[2:35:08] <%yoshkosh20> yeah. anime is as old as time itself
[2:35:08] <%lovebass4stuff> the buuhda was the first j-popidol
[2:35:09] <circular7> TheIlluminati
[2:35:09] <starotter70> The Bible was an anime
[2:35:10] <%JD_Lars> Detective Conan is like turn of the millennia
[2:35:11] <$Brother_Coduss> @AngriestPat japan had tentacle hentai in the 1800's tho, so *shrug

[2:35:20] <$KnivesEve> anime was real 400 years ago, but now they are fairy tales
[2:35:22] <frozenottsel> i mean, technically yes
[2:35:23] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> @angriestpat actually I think the 400 years old is accurate
[2:35:26] <arkv01> ancient egyptians were MASSIVE WEEBS
[2:35:26] <%spiritofmojave> LUL
[2:35:26] <%MonsieurHedge> that claydol-looking fertility goddess figure is just the first figma to ever be hotglued and you KNOW IT
[2:35:27] <Macmo696> LUL
[2:35:28] <%Idziman> Anime predates the Bible and the torah

[2:35:30] <%arancet> thats about when berserk started, right?
[2:35:31] <Xelhesia> manga is actually 200 years, minus the panels tho
[2:35:32] <Vohs_Bru> Anime was the first tool

[2:35:42] <+krispen_wa> Hai
[2:35:43] <arkv01> in fact Araki was a fucking pharaoh
[2:35:43] <joneworldbeater> Was anime created by ancient aliens?
[2:35:45] <%lovebass4stuff> the holy knights were mega weebs @AngriestPat
[2:35:50] <Jnkolm> The Ten Commandments were originally chiseled as manga
[2:35:52] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> Kiryu: "I have forgotten what I was even doing."
[2:35:54] <majindusto> Alice in Wonderland is an Isekai
[2:35:56] <+scholarlysorcerer> The Epic of Gilgamesh was the first battle manga
[2:35:56] <bearwagon> fucking parted the red sea with a beyblade
[2:35:57] <%ThatGuyfromMars> the story of jesus was based on naruto
[2:36:00] <%shiplord13> @AngriestPat In Japan the first cave paintings depicted a boy with spiky hair fighting against an ominous guy in weird clothes.
[2:36:04] <%jiin6> Ignore grandson
[2:36:05] <+kojibeoulve> man think of how exciting a day in kiryu's life is

[2:36:14] <+krispen_wa> Fate Stay Night proves life was just anime
[2:36:17] <%Kirijuo> Life is just the live action adaptation of the Bible Manga
[2:36:17] <starotter70> @ThatGuyfromMars That's why he's so OP
[2:36:21] <%supersugoisenpai1> Should come back later
[2:36:22] <Archmortal> @shiplord13 don't forget the ominous guy was the first bishounen with long flowing silver hair
[2:36:23] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Jesus does have a stand after all
[2:36:26] <%jiin6> he still not there
[2:36:33] <TReaperx1> @AngriestPat i really dont want to tell you but it pops back in a minute
[2:36:38] <alcors_wisdom> but no seriously basically the christian ran around telling everyone "if you dont marry a virgin youre basically a cuck" and after a few hundred years of the shogunaut killing christians it finally stuck and that evolved into the sort of "pure white" fetishism after they first left isolationism in the 1800's
[2:36:39] <%Dementedpenguin> Noah's Ark had the sickest anime opening.
[2:36:40] <primarch_lupercal> didnt you guys know? moses parted the red sea with a beyblade
[2:36:40] <%yoshkosh20> the illiad was the first shonen manga.
[2:36:45] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> Oh right we beat up yakuza in these games?
[2:36:48] <%Kirby_Sauce> @Rincewind1998 here's the thing though, through their money, a company can MAKE shit like that legal. Look up why trams aren't more widespread. Or why sega got bumped out of the sports game market.

[2:38:21] <%yoshkosh20> odepis rex was the first manga that made incest popular
[2:38:21] <%Idziman> could beyblades have been devices humans used to unlock Spiral energy in the Gurren Lagann universe?

[2:39:05] <ShichiNoBushi> Kazuma Kuwabara from Yuyu Hakusho?
[2:39:07] <Rincewind1998> @Kirby_Sauce I don't see what that has to do with me saying the idol industry is the most messed up LEGITIMATE business. I'm speaking purely in terms of things that happen and are accepted as common practice in that industry. Not the potential for illegal acts or political manipulation to make shit legal.
[2:39:07] <majindusto> Pat is the Dimbest
[2:39:08] <%jiin6> @lovebass4stuff mr shakedown is soooo yakuza 0
[2:39:08] <DashXero> Man. What an ugly suit.
[2:39:12] <+joyoustechnoshrine> i love how kiryu just fucking LAUNCHES sometimes
[2:39:13] <alcors_wisdom> @Youwereeatenbyalid yeah basically the missionaries showed up durring the 70's in the korean war for obvious reasons and to raise morale the sisters would sing kareoke
[2:39:13] <digitalsoulspark> go back to Yu Yu Hakusho
[2:39:15] <+kojibeoulve> i always wonder what it'd be like if wei shen met kiryu
[2:39:17] <Vohs_Bru> siriba NO HETERO
[2:39:18] <+Diabetic> I like these games cause Kiryu literally is just a murder house and people continue to fight him
[2:39:22] <+krispen_wa> She feels not better now anymore?
[2:39:25] <majima666> mr libido doesnt get enough love
[2:39:27] <$MonsterEnvy> Yeah you have to finisht he story at night

[2:51:46] <+joyoustechnoshrine> idol industry is a fuck
[2:51:46] <Valentinius_Anodyne> The lesson is that the idol industry is super fucked up

[2:54:52] <$cureneckbeard> lets go meddle
[2:54:53] <%Omegaanimus> I think it was Noam Chomsky who said the Japanese are disciplined to an extreme fault
[2:54:54] <+miguelrod777> WTF

[2:55:08] <Ner234> TRUST NO ONE
[2:55:08] <%Laecerelius> KiRYU FUCKED UP!
[2:55:16] <%Omegaanimus> The Japanese work harder than they work smart
[2:55:17] <jorgeniev> if she says what i think she is going to say
[2:55:18] <doughboymcguy> misa needs to kick kiryus ass
[2:55:19] <extradopeness> Yeyeye
[2:55:22] <%radda343> pat shoves the npcs so they know the size of his huge gaijin dick
[2:55:27] <joneworldbeater> Here comes the 'everyone sacrificed so much just to help me' bullshit.
[2:55:31] <%supersugoisenpai1> I wish I was Kiryu, so I could them how fucked up this plan is
[2:55:35] <mastersolrac> now capture the emotionally scarred child
[2:55:36] <Amasepyt> Being an idol in this universe is explicitly not a good thing though
[2:55:43] <majindusto> KIRYU SMASH!
[2:55:44] <%ECRead> Kaaaaamiyama
[2:55:46] <@lewdskeletor13> Let’s be honest guys, the end of this story is gonna be her accepting that the people who emotionally manipulated her were right cause JAPAN
[2:55:52] <+TheBigO75> Being an Idol is a legit hell
[2:55:55] <@Fuggins4U> DAMN
[2:55:56] <%rumtumtugnutz> She's mad so she's gonna go run a train on a bunch of delinquents.
[2:55:58] <@Fuggins4U> That's new
[2:55:58] <%Omegaanimus> Become an idol, marry Okada, get death threats
[2:56:02] <extradopeness> Defeat the enemy
[2:56:09] <zepelinnn> "ill make x hate me so he/she can follow their dreams" is not a Japan only thing chat
[2:56:11] <%laazybulbasaur> He’s fine
[2:56:13] <$KnivesEve> @lewdskeletor13 your right and i hate it
[2:56:15] <%ECRead> man, I wanna watch Cromartie again
[2:56:15] <%Omegaanimus> I would have loved to see those idol fans actually TRY to kill Okada in person
[2:56:20] <zepelinnn> its pretty common actually, not in this context of course
[2:56:20] <nawleenspoboy> @angriestpat is the combat in this better than yakuza 0
[2:56:28] <joneworldbeater> This is basically Yukiko's story from P4, except way darker and shittier.
[2:56:31] <%logoth_> Not goons. LOWLIVES
[2:56:32] <person181> so many goons
[2:56:41] <morningmoondude> But Pat, isn't this how you got Paige to go to Japan??
[2:56:41] <%logoth_> You have goons, lowlives, and "shady men"
[2:56:42] <natebud> They pulled a Harry Meets the Hendersons on her
[2:56:45] <%AllyBeeBoo> to be fair you attacked them
[2:56:47] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> the "ill act different to make her follow her dreams" is a typical story
[2:56:47] <+Deano8817> HOLY SHIT LUL
[2:56:48] <%Ascethetic> @AngriestPat heads up: Surveillance is in the shrine in DBD

[3:00:48] <%Hammerknife> that weird japanese girl bend over pose is something i have never seen anyone actually do in real life
[3:00:48] <Ion_Laser> WTF
[3:00:48] <majindusto> THE DIMBEST
[3:00:48] <Amasepyt> That was so confusing
[3:00:50] <joneworldbeater> BIG GOOD END
[3:00:50] <+kojibeoulve> that was the absolute worst
[3:00:50] <doughboymcguy> im gonna do dishes
[3:00:50] <jorgeniev> emergeance intensifies
[3:00:51] <%Omegaanimus> Noam Chomsky was right about Japan
[3:00:52] <fruit_pie_the_magician> STORY MiSSIONS
[3:00:52] <%supersugoisenpai1> Nobody is this stupid
[3:00:52] <%El_Desperad0> Worst side quest in the series
[3:00:52] <%spiritofmojave> DIMBEST
[3:00:53] <starotter70> What a good sidequest
[3:00:54] <lloyddboy> BIG DIMB
[3:00:54] <+paladinstarbuster> CULTURAL DIFFERNCES
[3:00:56] <VanLynx> Kiryu "Your Dream is Stupid and I Hate You" Kazuma
[3:00:56] <Luesagna00> hahaha all kiryus fault this girl has copying dreams
[3:00:56] <%Emperor_Machinus> This why japan has the baby problems
[3:00:57] <@Fuggins4U> I retired from being an idol years ago, it was NOTHING like this.
[3:00:59] <Mr_Strut> You were WAY stupider
[3:01:01] <%theAncopro> so NOW what's dumbest sidequest in all yakuzie
[3:01:03] <%DSD24> I think the word is naive
[3:01:04] <Valentinius_Anodyne> The dimbest, you mean?
[3:01:07] <%supersugoisenpai1> Agreed, the worst sidequest
[3:01:07] <DraxTD> you got a f'king trophy for THAT SHIT
[3:01:09] <alexandrecau> @AngriestPat you went to cégep, you were that stupid
[3:01:10] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Pat you need to turn it to night time through story progress.
[3:01:11] <SirKamBam> IDK Pat, you were pretty dimb
[3:01:12] <Nina96> @paladinstarbuster STILL FUCKED UP THOUGH
[3:01:12] <Hellarussian> the tigers elbow
[3:01:12] <@lewdskeletor13> I despise the fact that the game treats that story like its romantic or some shit
[3:01:13] <Macmo696> She needs to learn life doesn't care about her dream
[3:01:15] <%radda343> "The media never leaves you alone, so you'll run away and abandon your family and then get knocked up by <REDACTED> so your dad has to beat up half of hiroshima to save everyone"
[3:01:17] <%laserbeaming> These are all beyond stupid
[3:01:18] <%Laecerelius> Pat needs to boost that attack!
[3:01:18] <natebud> Did our Yakuzies orange baby man make some Idol producer friends too?
[3:01:20] <%rumtumtugnutz> That was a dimb fucking mission
[3:01:21] <starotter70> @Fuggins4U Idols... Idols have changed
[3:01:26] <%Omegaanimus> This story makes the Pizza girl look like a genius
[3:01:26] <falconx9k> TAIGA DROPPU
[3:01:27] <goombella> maybe the idol industry is rough because the idols are dumbos
[3:01:28] <@lewdskeletor13> I need to go shower

[3:01:35] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Westerners not understanding Japanese culture? Imagine my shock Kappa
[3:01:36] <CrimsonFox777> Aw shit, here we go agani.
[3:01:39] <omen_setter> @Omegaanimus "to be honest, I can't stand Japan" - Noam Chomsky
[3:01:40] <Ion_Laser> I need a drink
[3:01:40] <VRNK> yeah get drunk and erase all memory of that fucking quest
[3:01:42] <%supersugoisenpai1> Take out your frustration on these goons
[3:01:43] <SPKTR34> @radda343 she will get knocked up by a SCP!?
[3:01:43] <@lewdskeletor13> I need to clean that filth of me
[3:01:44] <%rumtumtugnutz> GOOONS

[3:02:02] <a_mad_dragon> go back to your shitty forum, goons
[3:02:03] <%radda343> no fight the school girl with the gigantic backpack, she's clearly a crystal lizard
[3:02:05] <+joyoustechnoshrine> i think this is shitty even for japanese culture, like ever seen perfect blue? idol industry is a fuck @gyro_gogo_zeppeli
[3:02:06] <%Laecerelius> SHE LOVES IT!
[3:02:07] <falconx9k> She loves the violence
[3:02:08] <@lewdskeletor13> @gyro_gogo_zeppeli Oh please
[3:02:23] <extradopeness> Ah yes Sagats favorite sex move Tiger Up Her- nvm
[3:02:23] <%rumtumtugnutz> Eat all the beers

[3:02:26] <%supersugoisenpai1> Drink the sadness and anger away
[3:02:26] <%manwithboxonhead> Go back to 4chan

[3:02:30] <jorgeniev> let me consume all your food
[3:02:33] <falconx9k> Give me ever individual piece of food you have
[3:02:34] <%Omegaanimus> Let's face it, if it entertains us it probably was made by ass holes in suits
[3:02:35] <majindusto> Drink the Pain Away
[3:02:37] <eviljake9> why are bystanders running away from the fight? They used to block the fighters in until only one remained.
[3:02:42] <Nina96> @paladinstarbuster how is tricking someone that there loved ones will abandon them so they can go off to some other place not be fucked up?
[3:02:43] <theobble> you missed a spot
[3:02:44] <falconx9k> "Hi I'm back"
[3:02:46] <$cureneckbeard> How is Kiryu not a sphere
[3:02:46] <+joyoustechnoshrine> eat the pain away
[3:02:51] <frozenottsel> kiryu your workout tho
[3:02:57] <omen_setter> all these goons out. SA must be down
[3:03:00] <@lewdskeletor13> Kiryu has a Speed Force metabolism
[3:03:00] <%radda343> but I'll take the highball tho
[3:03:01] <cumurasame> I actually do sort of understand what they were going for with Japanese cuture too but personally I feel there comes a point in your life where you and others should care about what you want, instead of forcing what you think they want
[3:03:03] <TioXyco> boy, you drunk now
[3:03:07] <%sporeian94> sporeian94 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! Pat, Do you think caterpillars know that they're supposed to become butterflies?
[3:03:08] <extradopeness> No tea
[3:03:08] <falconx9k> After that subquest you need all the alcohol
[3:03:16] <%Laecerelius> Big drunk grandpa!
[3:03:17] <jorgeniev> isis kiryu a sayian?
[3:03:18] <+Curua> I wish this worked like GTA San Andreas, where you could turn into a lardass
[3:03:19] <kerotuyu> Dude's hangry for a pangry
[3:03:21] <%MrSuperCasualBoom> @cureneckbeard He is a cube under Pat’s control.
[3:03:22] <ShichiNoBushi> Drunk lvl 9

[3:03:23] <%radda343> you are drunk as fuck
[3:03:26] <majindusto> Drink to Forget
[3:03:27] <person181> and that's the best time to fight crime
[3:03:30] <alexandrecau> @eviljake9 because now they know kiryu enough to run or be a witness to murder
[3:03:32] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> I think the guy is wrong for manipulating but sometimes there are people who actually feel like theyre holding back the ones they love
[3:03:34] <zepelinnn> level 9 drunk is pretty drink
[3:03:34] <%Idziman> no digni-tea

[3:06:40] <shamblerhero> LUL
[3:06:47] <$MonsterEnvy> Also the Yomei Allience Captain.
[3:06:48] <Nina96> @paladinstarbuster she said she was just gonna retire soon though
[3:06:48] <+joyoustechnoshrine> he says that so casually lmao
[3:06:49] <+zaworldo> 20 guys ez
[3:06:51] <mastersolrac> Kiryu fough a helicopter
[3:06:51] <alexandrecau> thing is matsunaga and Nagumo can take 20 guys
[3:06:53] <a_mad_dragon> wow, 20 guys, it might take kiryu a whole ten minutes to kill them all
[3:06:56] <+Taglog7> mena rd?
[3:06:58] <CurrySauseBandit> Kiryu should just comment like, "Only 20?" without realizing it.
[3:06:58] <ravencloak13> @jiin6 He fought 1,000’s though...
[3:06:58] <%Niney_Who> Kiryu can dodge Missiles
[3:07:01] <%theAncopro> ohno
[3:07:03] <%MrSuperCasualBoom> I will beat all 20 men...no homo
[3:07:13] <+quinnage7> @AngriestPat So Yamato never got into a real fight and got shitcanned by carriers
[3:07:13] <Macmo696> 20 v 1 man does Kiryu outnumber them
[3:07:15] <+joyoustechnoshrine> you literally should though, hes gotten himself out of worse
[3:07:16] <%spiritofmojave> Kiryu has to beat off those men!
[3:07:18] <+Deano8817> Kiryu punched two tigers
[3:07:27] <+paladinstarbuster> @Nina96 she said her dream was retire LIKE Haruka not that she would retire soon
[3:07:29] <primarch_lupercal> he's a civilian dumbass yakuza NotLikeThis
[3:07:29] <simulationbard> On no 20 whole dudes, who could ever take on 20 guys at once. They'ed have to be some sort of huge badass
[3:07:30] <MoulesFritz> 20 dudes, that
[3:07:31] <alexandrecau> fuck the foreigner- fat yakuza
[3:07:33] <Archmortal> You basically need military artillery to fuck with Kiryu or people he cares about at this point
[3:07:36] <+zaworldo> Kiryu? APOLOGIZE?
[3:07:38] <Valentinius_Anodyne> How many Yakuza do you think Kiryu can beat off?
[3:07:40] <%theAncopro> we don't say sorry in THIS business
[3:07:45] <MoulesFritz> 30 dudes should take kiryu like, 3 minutes
[3:07:49] <ravencloak13> Wait, didn’t Kiryuu punch those 2 tigers at the same time?
[3:07:51] <RupanSen> "I'm super wasted btw"
[3:07:55] <falconx9k> Fucking normie
[3:07:55] <alexandrecau> racist toward even japanese
[3:07:58] <Nina96> @paladinstarbuster also he could have said follow your dreams none of this dumb shit needed to happen
[3:08:02] <TioXyco> did pat see that sega intends to release another yakuza by the end of this fiscal year?
[3:08:03] <%Over_ninek> well connected jerks
[3:08:04] <$Brother_Coduss> They could just get Kiryu to kill them all. 20 guys is basically a snack for him
[3:08:06] <%MrSuperCasualBoom> Can Kiryu beat all 20 with his bare hands?
[3:08:06] <%theAncopro> Freaky
[3:08:08] <vergil_angelo> @angriestpat Man twitter’s the fuckin worst, I just saw Woolie liking a big post about Avengers because someone responded to spoilercast
[3:08:11] <%Over_ninek> explains why they were just salarymen
[3:08:14] <lloyddboy> RISE UP
[3:08:17] <frozenottsel> Northrop Gruman would disagree with that statement
[3:08:17] <majindusto> Does Pat Know that Yuta is voiced by the same guy as Rikkiya from Yakuza 3?
[3:08:19] <%laserbeaming> that's dumb
[3:08:23] <+griffball13> big buisness
[3:08:31] <ravencloak13> Kiryu: “I’m super wasted and thus have super armor. Let me just deal with this in like... 10 seconds?”
[3:08:38] <falconx9k> Oh boy
[3:08:40] <@Fuggins4U> Big businesses occasionally (cough) have ties to organized crime.
[3:08:41] <$Brother_Coduss> WAIT! that boat is the YAMATO!
[3:08:43] <%Kataguro> Really? You think they can stop Kiryu?

[3:09:21] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> @Johno_san they don't.
[3:09:22] <+paladinstarbuster> @Nina96 the problem was that he felt she wouldnt have hence the plot? Its misguided but not evil

[3:13:08] <@Fuggins4U> I like the idea of Kiryu going up against different, unfamiliar mobs.
[3:13:09] <%krispen_wa> he once killed 100 dudes
[3:13:09] <%Over_ninek> time for Kiryu to do the thing he was told specifically not to do while here
[3:13:10] <Archmortal> I feel like if Kiryu dropped his title a little more than never it would solve so many problems.

[3:13:32] <%MagickBurritoh> MY DAUGHTER
[3:13:34] <simulationbard> @Nobrev They talked about it earlier but the Yakuza in this area are really insular and don't interact much with outsiders so most of them have no idea who Kiryu is
[3:13:36] <%GarbageNirvana> "I'm just going to start swinging my arms around and if they get hit it's their fault"
[3:13:39] <$MonsterEnvy> Well the guy going down there is the Captain of the Yomei

[3:17:15] <starotter70> But its not Okuyasu's VA
[3:17:20] <$MonsterEnvy> It is though
[3:17:22] <42nfl19> but @AngriestPat even the MANAGER knows who he is!!
[3:17:23] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> Time for Kiryu to kill some people
[3:17:23] <mr_ESB> Is that really okuyasu?
[3:17:24] <natebud> He's not even wearing his iconic grey suit
[3:17:24] <$Brother_Coduss> too rural for big city names
[3:17:25] <Johno_san> that actually mnakes a lot of sense
[3:17:25] <%Ganerumo> he's been in jail for a while
[3:17:28] <%radda343> and it's not like kiryu is some super rare name
[3:17:31] <$CarlosEoM> Well they gonna find out the hard way then
[3:17:32] <$MonsterEnvy> This is Wataru Takagi

[3:25:59] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Well, I'm glad made Kiryu made some friends
[3:25:59] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> WHEN DID YOU GET HERE?
[3:26:01] <%Omegaanimus> Freeze frame - roll credits
[3:26:01] <%ThatGuyfromMars> what the fuck
[3:26:01] <lloyddboy> LUL
[3:26:02] <%Ilpala> BULLSHIT
[3:26:02] <Ion_Laser> :D
[3:26:03] <Nina96> he sits
[3:26:03] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat Insurance scames.
[3:26:03] <+Artimadare> This is just a bad sitcom
[3:26:05] <circular7> magic boss man
[3:26:06] <%MisterRockett> he does
[3:26:06] <+tigerfang86> probably not
[3:26:06] <Archmortal> He insurance scams, remember
[3:26:07] <TurbulencE413> Ninja!
[3:26:08] <%MagickBurritoh> he hangs out
[3:26:08] <natebud> He's their mascot
[3:26:08] <goombella> He does insurance payouts!
[3:26:09] <%spiritofmojave> He just exists
[3:26:10] <%MisterRockett> he does much
[3:26:10] <+ElEversoris> he pays the rent Pat
[3:26:10] <%Kataguro> They run a bar(?)
[3:26:15] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> @angriestpat he's the final boss
[3:26:16] <jorgeniev> he was waiting with his KNIFE
[3:26:16] <%Ilpala> He magics around and eats sundaes
[3:26:17] <%Rngiddion> eat sundaes
[3:26:19] <President_valentine> Insurance fraud
[3:26:19] <person181> so they learned the lore
[3:26:20] <%ThatGuyfromMars> did they just pay takeshi just to show up in random scenes
[3:26:23] <$MonsterEnvy> Insurance fraud
[3:26:28] <primarch_lupercal> beat takeshi just decided to hang out at the sega offices all day @AngriestPat
[3:26:30] <goombella> pride?
[3:26:32] <+dukenux> It's always sunny in Oromichi
[3:26:34] <alrobot2014> because their bar is shit?
[3:26:37] <GalaxyCrusher> he's final boss
[3:26:37] <%Kataguro> It's fucking boring in this town
[3:26:38] <joneworldbeater> Beat Takeshi's gonna be the final boss. Callin' it now.
[3:26:39] <Macmo696> Because story reasons
[3:26:40] <%UW_Duncan> collect insurance and eat parfait its the dream tbh
[3:26:41] <circular7> Because it's...cool???
[3:26:43] <Basch71> reasons
[3:26:45] <%Over_ninek> they're technically protected by that bigger family
[3:26:46] <%jiin6> BEAT TAKESHI Pat
[3:26:47] <$Brother_Coduss> @AngriestPat because insurance scams are crimes, and the yakuza CONTROL crimes
[3:26:47] <%ThatGuyfromMars> he's beaten the shit out of EVERYONE
[3:26:47] <%krispen_wa> "ruthless"
[3:26:47] <VRNK> kiryu, notoriously ruthless
[3:26:48] <Archmortal> Ruthless? Kiryu NEVER killed anyone
[3:26:50] <RantingRavager> Didn't kill a single person: The Dragon of Dojima
[3:26:51] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat If you're yakuza you can run the bar without paying protection money.
[3:26:51] <Valentinius_Anodyne> "You didn't ask"
[3:26:51] <%Omegaanimus> Remember there's the protection money they're not collecting
[3:26:52] <%arancet> because theyd probably get their shit kicked by yakuza if they werent
[3:26:54] <+Innocuous_Goat> But then the organized crime comes for you
[3:26:54] <ミュウレ4242> becuase it's safer than not being yakuza.
[3:26:55] <%Over_ninek> so it probably keeps the heat off them
[3:26:57] <BunnyEmperor> A civilian who kills Yakoozies
[3:26:57] <kerotuyu> The legend, the beast
[3:26:57] <alexandrecau> @AngriestPat it's a kazama thing, hirose is an old big dick yakuza and they are his kids
[3:26:58] <+Taglog7> sky finance
[3:27:00] <+paladinstarbuster> Organized crime doesnt like that though
[3:27:01] <person181> no but the crime make it have honor
[3:27:01] <GoldeNOVA> The game's not called "Insurance Fraud 6"
[3:27:01] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> Nonsense, Kiryu never killed anyone.
[3:27:02] <jorgeniev> what no that is what organised crime IS
[3:27:03] <@commanderclaw> He left that fucking life a decade ago
[3:27:03] <count_bob> "Now that I have your attention."
[3:27:07] <majindusto> HE’S TAKESHI KITANO... He does Whatever he wants!
[3:27:12] <count_bob> "Are you fucking my daughter?"
[3:27:18] <pwnhills> "Oh"
[3:27:18] <%krispen_wa> A demon inside has a hold of him
[3:27:21] <42nfl19> I left that past behind...but I still beat up Yakuza
[3:27:21] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @commanderclaw and before that, like 30 years ago
[3:27:24] <kerotuyu> Oh
[3:27:25] <joneworldbeater> He's gonna be super jacked and have a big red demon on his back or some shit.
[3:27:27] <%MagickBurritoh> wtf
[3:27:27] <starotter70> Gotta get some sleep, night guys, have a good stream
[3:27:29] <%LuckyLagomorph> Kirose is the fucking best
[3:27:30] <+griffball13> he's like a kind grandpa
[3:27:31] <+TheBigO75> Did you fuck my Daughter
[3:27:31] <goombella> I really do love that patriarch though
[3:27:32] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> Which one of you bastards fucked my daughter.
[3:27:33] <%MelBrooksKA> Nah, all crimes are organized in Japan
[3:27:34] <%LuckyLagomorph> Hirose*
[3:27:36] <derap41> That guy is hiding his treasure chest he got from New Zeland
[3:27:37] <worldbrand> he just has a tattoo of beat takeshi's face
[3:27:38] <CrowbarFacelift> Oh yeah that baby still exists
[3:27:40] <%jiin6> remember that one time Beat Takeshi did a Battle Royale
[3:27:42] <person181> get the baby from the SHRINE
[3:27:42] <President_valentine> Hiose is great
[3:27:43] <InugamiTheHound> gramps fucked his daughter
[3:27:43] <%Omegaanimus> @AngriestPat Ever hear of Takeshi's infamous video game he designed one drunken night?
[3:27:46] <+paladinstarbuster> Did you fuckers run a train on my daugther
[3:27:46] <primarch_lupercal> No kiryu get the info first
[3:27:47] <circular7> Haruto is deaf
[3:27:48] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@miguelrod777)
[3:27:48] <+zaworldo> NO kiryu
[3:27:50] <majindusto> HIROSE IS GREAT

[3:27:51] <circular7> dead*
[3:27:52] <+tigerfang86> I WONDER
[3:27:53] <mastersolrac> that old man is senile or faking it.
[3:27:55] <Graywolf_the_45th> it was beat takeshi
[3:27:56] <%Omegaanimus> The video game that requires you to not do anything for an hour
[3:27:56] <+Taglog7> it was the old man
[3:27:56] <%zanzibar_junker> Go to bar
[3:27:57] <count_bob> It was beat takeshi
[3:27:58] <goombella> Haruto... the BABY.>:(((( Someone has to feel guilty.
[3:27:58] <Ion_Laser> Which one of you fucked my daugther? You get a free ass kicking!
[3:28:01] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> ...is Kiryu just going to guilt them into it?
[3:28:03] <+Deano8817> does he?
[3:28:03] <Ner234> ALL OF THEM
[3:28:04] <godzookylives> THEY ALL DID
[3:28:04] <%onlystrykerfan> I hope it was beat takeshi
[3:28:04] <%Kataguro> He did in the late 80s

[3:31:58] <mankeyfigh> DAPUSSY
[3:31:59] <vergil_angelo> @angriestpat Nagoshi and Takashi are drinking buddies, but Nagoshi was very afraid to ask him to be in the game for years. Since Y6 was a huge shift in Engine and story, he mustered the courage to finally ask
[3:31:59] <Megapikman132> I'm loving this lighting
[3:31:59] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> *Physics intensifies*
[3:31:59] <%Omegaanimus> The cafe guy is sending people to Hiroshima from Tokyo to pick up cats

[3:32:20] <%Laecerelius> Pat needs more food badly
[3:32:22] <+Deano8817> the biggest loss in this game was kiryu's ability to throw motherfuckers into the ocean
[3:32:22] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> Fuck why are there not railing flip moves
[3:32:26] <godzookylives> That guys skull is in pieces

[3:33:00] <%Laecerelius> Endless trash!
[3:33:01] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> We live in a world in which kiryu can vault railings but he can't throw people over
[3:33:02] <@lewdskeletor13> Kiryu doesn’t kill people so he can’t drown them
[3:33:03] <%AncelDeLambert> lol, traffic just rolling over their corpses
[3:33:08] <derap41> Now chuck the baby into the bay save yourself some trouble

[3:33:33] <%AncelDeLambert> Kiryu eats like a Monster Hunter
[3:33:33] <%Hammerknife> the food system seems incomplete without a shitting system
[3:33:37] <+Kingly0729> DESTROYSTERS
[3:33:38] <mankeyfigh> Yo chat why does Pat overeat?

[3:33:49] <ミュウレ4242> of shoes, of ships, of ceiling wax. of cabbages and kings!
[3:33:51] <President_valentine> there's a pissing minigame in Kiwami 2
[3:33:51] <MoulesFritz> he needs the food
[3:33:56] <%sporeian94> So what Yakuza game should be your frist?
[3:34:01] <VRNK> kiryu has the metabolism of a salarian
[3:34:04] <Jack_Nightshadow> maybe more stats.
[3:34:05] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> He basically just has super-powered metabolism
[3:34:05] <@lewdskeletor13> Play Zero

[3:34:07] <%Kataguro> @sporeian94 Zero
[3:34:07] <%GarbageNirvana> *GGXrd announcer* DESTROYED
[3:34:10] <$cureneckbeard> Pat eats this much in Yakuza because he thinks this is a normal amount for people to eat in a day
[3:34:10] <natebud> zero
[3:34:15] <mankeyfigh> @sporeian94 Yakuza Kiwami
[3:34:18] <Mnightshyamallama> it is honestly messed up how little purple xp you get compared to the rest of them
[3:34:19] <%AncelDeLambert> Kiryu is actually the T-1000, he eats food and heals all wounds
[3:34:23] <@lewdskeletor13> Zero is till my fave in the series
[3:34:28] <%sporeian94> is there like a guide for order, is it just chronilogical?
[3:34:31] <%Over_ninek> "Can i be Haruto's grandma"
[3:34:32] <+paladinstarbuster> "come inside"
[3:34:32] <mr_ESB> Kiryu needs to start a food challenge channel
[3:34:35] <%MagickBurritoh> was she just standing there for hours?
[3:34:36] <Ultimatefool> Baby is so cute wtf
[3:34:37] <%lovebass4stuff> anime mom tome
[3:34:37] <natebud> Maybe it should be kiwami because 0 is the high point
[3:34:37] <@lewdskeletor13> It’s chronological
[3:34:39] <%lovebass4stuff> *time
[3:34:41] <%lovebass4stuff> here\

[3:34:43] <indig0bird> No, but Kiryu wants to come inside
[3:34:44] <%radda343> "did you want to come inside my completely featurless temporary apartment"
[3:34:51] <+tigerfang86> Stolen baby
[3:34:52] <ミュウレ4242> kiru only burns 200 calories per murder. he needs that food.
[3:34:56] <%Remery_> Just marry her already
[3:34:57] <majindusto> Little Feet
[3:34:58] <%Laecerelius> Ooooh!
[3:35:00] <@lewdskeletor13> If you start at zero the rest of the games are in order
[3:35:03] <%AncelDeLambert> these two need to BONE ALREADY
[3:35:03] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> @angriestpat legally stole it
[3:35:05] <%El_Desperad0> Will Kiryu finally FUCK?

[3:35:15] <+millionstabz> Pretty sure Kiryu doesnt even know how sex works
[3:35:17] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> If there was a woman kiryu should fuck, it is this woman
[3:35:17] <%Over_ninek> the HONOR barrier at work
[3:35:18] <%MagickBurritoh> Old man just turned around
[3:35:19] <derap41> That woman looks familiar
[3:35:20] <lloyddboy> mmMMMmm

[3:35:24] <%ThatGuyfromMars> mama should totally bang kiryu
[3:35:26] <Mnightshyamallama> question, is she someone that is a famous actress in japan or something or is she just a VA?

[3:36:00] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> Kiryu could crush that babies skull in an instant
[3:36:00] <derap41> You know his thinking about it right now
[3:36:05] <%AncelDeLambert> Kiryu: "how does this tiny human work, it can't even punch anything."

[3:36:29] <+smargh1015> you don't understand, if kiryu ever has sex he will lose his yakuzi powers
[3:36:29] <%NWR_James> @AngriestPat The reason you need yakuza connections to run insurance scams is people ask less questions

[3:54:33] <%Hammerknife> @AngriestPat the animations didn't put you off that? the art is great but the anims are meh
[3:54:35] <%ECRead> or Tales of Berseria. which is just Berserk with fem Guts
[3:54:38] <@lewdskeletor13> @joneworldbeater Night!
[3:54:39] <%Sabre_Basilisk> I dont trust pat and kickstarter games after mighty no.9
[3:54:45] <%ECRead> cool
[3:54:53] <%king_wragles> What was the name again?
[3:54:59] <+Taglog7> this is just a tribute
[3:55:07] <mr_ESB> Ah alright, woolie left off at ada
[3:55:07] <+TheBigO75> Thats fair
[3:55:16] <%Sabre_Basilisk> Thats ture
[3:55:21] <Xelhesia> tales of the abyss, vesperia, and symphonia are the best tales games
[3:55:21] <%sshen> Only kickstarter game Ive trusted has been shantae
[3:55:22] <%Sabre_Basilisk> true*
[3:55:29] <Nina96> are the tales games connected? or naw?
[3:55:30] <+WonderLandGhost> I mean mighty no.9 is rough, but as Pat said there are some good Kickstarters
[3:55:30] <circular7> don't beat yourself up over it
[3:55:31] <ValidVenasaur> Hollow Knight was a Kickstarter game
[3:55:32] <HyperBomb21> Liam still seething over Pat apologizing for MN9
[3:55:32] <President_valentine> At least Pat wasn't defending until the end
[3:55:34] <mr_ESB> Bloodstained pls be good
[3:55:39] <Graywolf_the_45th> Always trust Kickstarter games with Knight in the name, like Hollow Knight and Shovel Knight
[3:55:47] <@lewdskeletor13> Kirby the fake crazy person
[3:55:50] <%Kirby_Sauce> did Paige not bring it up?
[3:55:59] <+WonderLandGhost> what was the name of the game he's talking about though?
[3:56:03] <circular7> bloodstained better be good
[3:56:04] <RupanSen> There are actually a lot of good Kickstarter games

[3:57:15] <ShichiNoBushi> Or dulling the edge?
[3:57:16] <%MagickBurritoh> get dulled
[3:57:18] <%krispen_wa> Pat is wrong? How?
[3:57:19] <%Nobrev> @AngriestPat it depends on the kind of parry you want to perform
[3:57:21] <circular7> the 2 blur, pat and woolie
[3:57:22] <VRNK> you can do either

[3:57:59] <%CaptainPileDriver> so, are you done streaming for tonight?
[3:58:00] <Graywolf_the_45th> The melee rework made me unable to play the game anymore
[3:58:00] <Caidezes> Nightwave was exhasuting.
[3:58:03] <$cureneckbeard> You still parry with the front even though it's gonna get dings in it, because parrying with the back is really unwieldy. You just sharpen that ding out as best you can
[3:58:05] <InugamiTheHound> yeah nightwave can burn me out kinda. I'm at level 30 finally
[3:58:10] <Nina96> I never beat wolf...
[3:58:14] <%sshen> Nightwave burned me because 15 wolf tokens only

[3:58:39] <%krispen_wa> Poor James Marsden, a cursed existence
[3:58:40] <+river_city98> How do you go from doing Westworld to that?
[3:58:42] <Run44forrest> gangsta paradise people are annoying
[3:58:43] <$cureneckbeard> A sharp blade is gonna catch another sharp blade because it'll bite in
[3:58:54] <Nina96> @onlystrykerfan yeah back in the early 80s maybe
[3:59:03] <%krispen_wa> He went from Westworld Season 2 to that. It's not a big downgrade
[3:59:12] <%ECRead> then again, i don't have a single prime
[3:59:22] <RupanSen> pretty much
