[1:45:38] <RubberFistFight> @yourliteraldog in this setting, a single company has control over what's left of Poland after some kind of techno-warfare ruined potentially the rest of the planet. If you've seen "Continuum" (canadian sci-fi show) it's a similar concept to the "corporate congress" -only it's a monopolistic entity.

[1:59:03] <%honeyman18> Really great reasons to never go outside.
[1:59:04] <RubberFistFight> @dukenux the problem in this case is it's not fast. It takes a long time and the people feel every bit of it.

[2:04:09] <RubberFistFight> He doesn't have a credit for this on his IMDB, I honestly think it's just Rutger Hauer putting on a voice. This was done on a lowww budget, so they probably couldn't afford too many VAs

[2:04:22] <DriedLeafJuice> Cheese is the Godfood
[2:04:23] <%Agami23> its because white people are less likely to be lactose intolerant. some mutation in the genes

[2:14:49] <RubberFistFight> @nukle0nik I love how you're reliving the memories in a totally non-contiguous way. Like, even without the dude being on death's door, memory itself isn't a clean "a leads to b leads to c" thing. You can't just read a mind the way they do in fantasy. It'd be a horrible mess unless you had personal context to ascribe meaning to what you were seeing.

[2:27:36] <nukle0nik> "jacked-in-k"?
[2:27:39] <Khorneflakes_> Observers must have messed up minds after experiences like this LUL

[2:28:47] <%doc_ock_rokc> but can't
[2:28:47] <ChrisM341> Its Rewind Time
[2:28:48] <+ClaudeMcGarren> @yourliteraldog God the day I found out about that stuff lol
[2:28:50] <arisekicked> Its bullshit, imagine living the deaths of people in first person and not developing massive PTSD
[2:28:52] <RubberFistFight> Well I mean it's generally inadvisable to jack into the mind of a dying man. They'd usually use it as a form of interrogation on a healthy person.
[2:28:53] <+Estuko> All Observers must go through Omikron in a single longplay session to determine if they're mentally capable of handling this experience.
[2:28:53] <Cloud_Face333> Well you are no supposed to hook onto a dying person
[2:28:56] <Big_King_Coconut> my shower does that too
[2:28:57] <%aishman> @AngriestPat It's also that you're not supposed to jack into someone that's dying/dead cause shit can be REAL bad.
[2:28:58] <dapperskeleton69> ZA WARUDO
[2:29:00] <%rumtumtugnutz> just poop in the shower.
[2:29:01] <+dirtyh4rr1> great, you broke it
[2:29:01] <tigerfang86> oh
[2:29:02] <fugnuggets01> ok
[2:29:05] <nukle0nik> jacking into a dying person has always been bad
[2:29:05] <tigerfang86> NICE JOB PAT
[2:29:07] <%BallerSwagBro9k> This is some heavy shit
[2:29:08] <tigerfang86> YOU BROKE THE SHOWER
[2:29:12] <%honeyman18> Enjoy

[2:29:27] <Jeemukun> THIS IS FINE
[2:29:32] <%aishman> Prison Shower
[2:29:33] <%BallerSwagBro9k> ITS AN OBJECT OF POWER
[2:29:34] <%aishman> Probably
[2:29:37] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat he wants to get clean?
[2:29:37] <tigerfang86> this is what happens when you BREAK A SHOWER
[2:29:37] <Jeemukun> probably got prison raped
[2:29:37] <+keyoray> wash away the sins
[2:29:39] <RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat now remember your lesson from Outer Wilds. Don't trip and fall off into the black hole repeatedly. Kappa
[2:29:42] <ChrisM341> I'm waiting for the red glowing ball to chase you from Downpour
[2:29:44] <Hellarussian> this is like poetry, it rhymes
[2:29:45] <%Valdorick> Why would a guy in prison have constant memories of a shower?
[2:29:47] <nuane> we must not be experiencing time regularly, armir should be dead by now
[2:29:48] <MetaFurrical> A Prisoner scared of showers, that's always a good thing
[2:29:49] <%QuestionableRadioactivity> PTSD from prison?

[2:30:09] <nukle0nik> ptsd from dropping the soap
[2:30:13] <MassConnect> does this have gameplay or just walking?
[2:30:20] <dukenux> What bad could happen in a prison shower?
[2:30:22] <+WizoSavage> Smash player's #1 nightmare
[2:30:24] <nuane> @Sapphire_Breeze he's collecting CRTs
[2:30:34] <DaBigVitus> Pat, what's your take on Bill Burrs joke about "a job you can do in your pyjamas isn't a hard job"?
[2:30:35] <Sapphire_Breeze> @nuane we cracked the case

We were crying and apologizing because we lost touch after our parents died, when I start to write this text:“The death of our parents left a void in our lives, but I’m sure we’ll be able to bridge that gap and be whole again.” I managed to shake off the possession before I pressed send. I then went around my house slapping together game cases while shouting “OK Kojoomer.”

[3:01:43] <RubberFistFight> @Rolandknight I was completely 100% committed to my ending, and I would not choose it differently. Can't say why because it'd spoil things for Pat, but yeah. No way was I gonna choose differently, given the choices at hand.

[3:22:28] <krymzen5> she could be doing nasty mind stuff to her tho
[3:22:30] <dukenux> the kid was already a vegetable
[3:22:31] <count_bob> It *will* turn the kid into a vegetable.
[3:22:32] <joylent_blue> she hears and then sees, she does not see and then hear

[3:22:57] <Daxalog> Its all filth
[3:23:01] <RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat yes it will return the kid to her braindead state. There's no cure for her very real (as in, exists IRL) disease.
[3:23:01] <Gruntini> This is like Marty seeing the child porn in True Detective
[3:23:04] <%LaughingCatt> IT IS NOT ABOUT BIRDS
[3:23:05] <+spiegelspike> @AngriestPat any decisions she could make for the kid are probably worse than being a vegetable

[3:27:00] <Gieron667> so if you reboot is the kid still there ?
[3:27:00] <haidanort> go up a floor
[3:27:08] <Gruntini> @ミュウレ4242 STRONKS
[3:27:10] <+Cymen90> Why did you give a child to the pedophile?
[3:27:14] <unas2e> wearing shorts Dan
[3:27:24] <%Captainahab_37> this game is DARK
[3:27:26] <nuane> dove....
[3:27:28] <SilverRoddo> That child is in an Invisible Kid.
[3:27:29] <%moogleboy1984> I just want you to know, I went to go buy this game because of that last sequence, and I already had it. Thank you for influencing my past self with your future streams, Pat.
[3:27:34] <MetaFurrical> LUL
[3:27:37] <%walternatorz> so there are doves??
[3:27:41] <+keyoray> Are all the pigeons here supposed to be kids?
[3:27:42] <tigerfang86> @SilverRoddo never see what they did
[3:27:42] <aGentlemanofLeisure > I think she was after a new body, you know her own was dying etc
[3:27:46] <+KaiSnow> Oh yo she wasn't really in there

[3:28:05] <BustRobot> I'm actually getting seriously intrigued by this game, like dang the perfect thing to play before Cyberpunk 2077
[3:28:05] <$Remery_> this weird cyber soul transfer bullshit
[3:28:07] <%Captainahab_37> Like I said, the Kid is lain, she was never real
[3:28:08] <nukle0nik> hookah!
[3:28:11] <RubberFistFight> Guys. If the "evil lady" wanted to go through with stealing the child's body, she would have done it long before Daniel showed up, since she was already at that stage when we found her, and was actively refusing to be anything more than an "imaginary friend" secondary personality in the kid's mind. When she learned her presence was allowing the kid to actually have a life, she got cold feet and it made her mother desire go into overdrive.
[3:28:14] <GrampsGrubberfly> "normal"
[3:28:15] <MetaFurrical> Hey Paige is on the table
[3:28:17] <+KaiSnow> yeah the kid was never actually in there

[3:55:06] <jobbedbone> it aint easy farming peen
[3:55:07] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> does it???
[3:55:07] <+Cymen90> @commanderclaw It would be "ethical" so yes. If you are vegan for ethical, not health reasons

[3:56:34] <RubberFistFight> @illTemperedSeaBass they did. I played through it in october and I loved it. Some parts are a little unpolished, like how the engine shits the bed when there's a lot of crazy physics, but as far as the story/world/theming goes, it's fucking ace.

[4:09:37] <+Cymen90> @dukenux Transhumanism is not about medical operations or about being saved with a pacemaker. It is about elevating what it is to be human through machinery and gene engineering. Which is dumb. @XeroSigmaPrime

[4:13:35] <nukle0nik> what does it say about nowak? something about a courtyard?
[4:13:37] <RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat you need to find Helena. Where's a place you saw in Amir's memories you haven't been yet?
[4:13:39] <Khorneflakes_> Maybe... this place is a labyrinth
[4:13:42] <%Saltmeisterr> THE DOLLS
[4:13:45] <Jeemukun> try hackingthat door in the basement maybe?
[4:13:49] <Doomstar16> Heh.
[4:13:52] <%rumtumtugnutz> @resorcfulraven Hush. Let him play the game.
[4:13:54] <%honeyman18> Aren't normans into transhumanism, I heard a podcast talking about how it was mostly started by a norman guy as a kind of religious thing.
[4:13:55] <+Cymen90> @dukenux No but a lab-grown organ is still a human organ.
[4:13:59] <+Terran_Gell> @AngriestPat Who married Helena and Amir?
[4:14:00] <nukle0nik> the noisy neighbour is the organ dealer
[4:14:00] <eccentricprinceofroses> someone who lives on the roof maybe?
[4:14:04] <%KevinsLunchbox> wait a minute, this isnt a room escape. its a building escape?
[4:14:06] <GrampsGrubberfly> this game makes me confused and uncomfortable

[4:14:11] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 14m.
[4:14:16] <%honeyman18> Mormans, my autocorrect is terrible
[4:14:17] <%KevinsLunchbox> nevermind, there an outside
[4:14:27] <ImmaCanuck> So is the doll room something you straight up had to hack to get in?
[4:14:33] <$Remery_> sick
[4:14:39] <%This_is_Marco> is the theme birds are evil?
[4:14:41] <dukenux> @Cymen90 and if we genetically modify that organ to be more effective and not fail as easily, or not to be rejected as easily, that's transhumanism
[4:14:43] <+Pajex_> nice limbs
[4:14:44] <+Cymen90> @XeroSigmaPrime Murder? You mean improvement. You said everyone should get a better heart when their real one is jank. I am saving her by making her insurance pay for it.
[4:14:48] <resorcfulraven> More creepy doll bullshit.
[4:14:53] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @Cymen90 A lab grown heart is a human heart but it circumvents normal human nature for a heart, aka transhuman
[4:14:53] <RubberFistFight> @Cymen90 ok so riddle me this. If lab-grown replacement parts for people AREN'T transhuman, then why do they show up so frequently in transhumanist fiction?
[4:14:53] <%Agami23> doesen't look much worse than my dads tattoo place.

[4:15:49] <Gruntini> I mean, aren't people with replacement limbs technically cyborgs?
[4:15:50] <Mister_McDerp> illegal prosthetics
[4:15:50] <%honeyman18> I always thought transhumanism was more spiritual in nature, sort of transcending the flesh.
[4:15:50] <RubberFistFight> @XeroSigmaPrime lol don't you love how when i ask him a question he can't answer, immediately we're "taking it too seriously"?
[4:15:53] <+lilgarbage_> Uhhhhhhh

[4:26:03] <+Cymen90> @XeroSigmaPrime You get sick more often than a superior human. So insurance is more expensive, your credit score is lower since you have less capital (within your body) and you are less likely to pay back any loans because of your debt. Only lower paying jobs are open to you now that you are one of the lesser people.
