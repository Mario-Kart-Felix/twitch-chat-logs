[0:06:26] <%CaptainPileDriver> @iwishthiswasicq well, it's either a smooth good looking statue basically or that clunky ass one from s.h. figurearts
[0:06:29] <MarylandJutsu> @reiju_22 you mean the trashfire game?
[0:06:37] <acrobaticballerina> you'll get em next time, kid
[0:06:38] <%Raxus_Secundus> Why would Pat want to piss off Paige Doorbreaker?
[0:06:41] <UncannyMatt> @reiju_22 hopefully never, that game is terrible
[0:06:55] <JAVATOMICTWITCH> For real this music is makin me slip and slide all over
[0:07:00] <Gray_skies1993> so is the name of Paige's stand officially [DOORBREAKER] now?

[0:07:02] <%RNGbob> sipsipDab apatWink apatDab sipsipDab apatWink apatDab
[0:07:04] <MarylandJutsu> I hope Paige or PAt bought Elmo some valentines gifts
[0:07:12] <%iwishthiswasicq> @CaptainPileDriver I guess asking for anything more would probably raise the price a bit. Fuck it, maybe I'll buy it too.
[0:07:17] <CrypticMochi> Paige should break a door for valentines
[0:07:23] <%ThirdWelles> Guys I have a dilemma
[0:07:24] <zafooru> wow pat a arma 3 stream i cant believe it

[0:07:28] <CrabSlacks> watching Pat play new vegas made me play through the game again, now I'm going through 2
[0:07:29] <%Ascethetic> chain*
[0:07:32] <OwlLightningMage> This song is so fucking good LUL
[0:07:34] <%DomunDomunDomun> If you want jump force just watch the clip of Billy beating some guy without looking at the screen.

[0:07:37] <%ThirdWelles> I want to get drunk for valentines day but I have classes in the morning
[0:07:38] <%kiiiirsten> apatHoldon
[0:07:40] <%CaptainPileDriver> @iwishthiswasicq trust me, i WISH it was her level 3, either of them, but yeah, anything else would raise the price
[0:07:48] <%Xooler67> nothing better than spending vday in the Mojave wasteland
[0:07:48] <monstergills> sipsipHellmo
[0:07:49] <Ir_ramble> Paige breaks the doors in her heart from all the McDonald's she eats

[1:33:57] <villagerislv35boss> U get killed by jackal gang members
[1:33:57] <nobknee> @FrostMass22 Whenever I see a movie, I watch the trailer to see how shitty it was. Of course, I have to actually see a movie first.

[1:54:26] <omen_setter> Paige has the exact same taste in food as my dad
[1:54:28] <lotharrio> Paige just drinking her pickle juice of 100% saturated salt water.
[1:54:30] <zafooru> into a jar of course

[1:54:37] <UnderpaidBob> is that Elon Musk?
[1:54:38] <%skizzuto> EMLO
[1:54:39] <%IronPickle> When Paige eventually does shit her self, will it smell like pickle juice?
[1:54:40] <KoyaMusa> pat you've done that before with the weird ball thing
[1:54:40] <RollCritFail> Howard Stark Pog
[1:54:43] <%afronooch> spat ula does sound better
[1:54:44] <DirtyPopcornJ> @ThatGuyfromMars I know. It's just the courier's reactions to that specifically and in the Honest Hearts DLC on the same subject are very different but that's me nitpicking writing.
[1:54:44] <+MechaBaphomet> give the baby the juice
[1:54:45] <%Remery_> Give Elmo some brine
[1:54:46] <%Skrypto> Oh that shit would be on pintrest, instagram, youtube and clipped within 30 secods
[1:54:47] <%Prism_Wing> you think that's gross? I contribute to society Kappa
[1:54:47] <%Aitch971> Emlo
[1:54:47] <+Rust_Wick> pat jr is on the way
[1:54:47] <Brandon__Brando> wait what
[1:54:48] <%Albadabar> Does Paige hide in the shame closet to drink her pickle juice like how Pat hides in there to eat chocolate?
[1:54:49] <EMP_Ike_Turner> Paige, her jar filled with brine
[1:54:49] <$autismweaponised> Liberty Prime behind him
[1:54:49] <C_S_N_G> That picture lasted 200 years quite well
[1:54:51] <Fujiwara_92> Look it's Stark father
[1:54:51] <xtremegamer80> Makes sense we would have an asshole in front of THE asshole's house
[1:54:53] <Brandon__Brando> ive never been here
[1:54:53] <cantthinkofaname1029> Aw man the chat goofed on me so I gotta ask again: They talk about the hollow knight reveal at all? Wanna make sure I didn't miss it if so
[1:54:56] <KeystoneA1> Plague was right about eating condiments from a trough
[1:54:58] <coreybom> Elmo wants to fucking die.
[1:54:59] <$NocturneNovember> spatoola? That the Irish pronunication, like tarantoola?
[1:55:00] <+sordcooper> oh, that portrait had a liberty prime cameo
[1:55:02] <%zeroboost> Pickle juice for hangovers SeemsGood
[1:55:02] <Intolerable> VINEGAR ADDICTION - it explains the love for mustard.
[1:55:08] <pimpinahz> THE PICKLE JUICE IS THE BEST. SAME AS THE HOT PEPPER BRINE. lol dont judge
[1:55:09] <omen_setter> Real patricians appreciate the brine
[1:55:10] <%DirtyGaijin> Paige drinking the juice like the bug alien in MIB
[1:55:12] <%Niney_Who> Vinegar is disgusting
[1:55:15] <Zantetzuken> does paige prefer warm, hot, or cold pickle juice?
[1:55:18] <Worldbrand> @cantthinkofaname1029 very briefly, they said it looks cool
[1:55:19] <%Das_Bass> HACKED
[1:55:19] <%Kahnicus> Steal all the Nuka Colas to make Nuka Quantums to make Nuke Grenades!
[1:55:20] <KoyaMusa> pat you failed a hack you literally modded to have one answer
[1:55:24] <+Grayhammatter> big hacked
[1:55:24] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @DirtyPopcornJ it's funny the one DLC Chris Avellone didn't have much input in has "eh" writing
[1:55:24] <zafooru> salt & vinegar chips are the best though
[1:55:25] <Fujiwara_92> WTF
[1:55:27] <Skatedeandre> Hot pickle juice WutFace
[1:55:28] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> hacked
[1:55:28] <cantthinkofaname1029> sweet thanks
[1:55:28] <Gray_skies1993> @DirtyPopcornJ I do agree with you though, it is odd that the Courier has different reactions. I agree with your writing nitpicks
[1:55:30] <Conky89> With passwords like these, no wonder computers are so easy to hack into...
[1:55:31] <TikanZK> nothing, cut quest
[1:55:31] <%mastertwin2> Why is that here???
[1:55:34] <+Eclipse_knight_> pickle juice is amazing
[1:55:35] <%Niney_Who> Cut Quest
[1:55:35] <daisymaisy02> Uh you hacked Mr House I guess
[1:55:35] <%ooblagis> That's for a minor sidequest
[1:55:35] <Doomac> @Zantetzuken The thought of HOT PICKLE JUICE makes me want to die
[1:55:36] <lotharrio> Oh that's a cut part of the game.
[1:55:37] <%Remery_> what does Vinegar taste like?
[1:55:41] <Skatedeandre> Also pickle juice makes me think of cum
[1:55:44] <OwlLightningMage> You people are weak. Pickle juice is fine
[1:55:45] <%brave_sj> You started the Lucky 38 Executive Override
[1:55:47] <lozscat> Cut quest
[1:55:47] <dekkitout> j sawyer mod, save us!
[1:55:50] <%CerberusDriver> isnt there a patch to re-insert cut content
[1:55:50] <%Skrypto> you can use a straw to poke a hole in a pickle, and then use the pickle as a straw to suck up more pickle juice with your new pickle straw
[1:55:51] <%DirtyGaijin> @Remery_ Regret
[1:55:54] <lotharrio> You used to need that, if you pissed off House and still wanted to do parts of his story.
[1:55:55] <%SmoochSpider> cold pickles and pickle juice is best
[1:55:57] <+mayatomr_> is this vanilla new vegas?
[1:56:03] <%Niney_Who> @Skrypto Cease
[1:56:04] <+Nomicro4u> Salt and Vinegar chips are good
[1:56:05] <%joylent_blue> there are mods
[1:56:07] <%Skrypto> LUL
[1:56:08] <%ooblagis> Oh, it was cut? It's one of the ones restored with mods anyway
[1:56:08] <lotharrio> They did this game in a year so like... give them a break.
[1:56:08] <SpookySpaghooti> @mayatomr_ yes
[1:56:09] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> MeTaCRiTiC RaTInG
[1:56:10] <+Exyoh> It's a segment for the Follower wanting you to bug the Lucky 38 @AngriestPat
[1:56:12] <%Prism_Wing> Pickled things are bad for the migraine prone, I believe.
[1:56:17] <Skatedeandre> Salt and vinegar chips are god tier
[1:56:19] <%ThatGuyfromMars> check the first video of the stream for the modlist
[1:56:20] <TheArrow_> this game was made in 8 months, right?
[1:56:20] <OwlLightningMage> Outer Worlds Kreygasm

[1:56:35] <+Dr_Butthurt_PhD> "occupied"
[1:56:36] <Conky89> An alternative to pickle juice is pickle pops. They are just the juice squeezed out of a pickle and then frozen.
[1:56:37] <%Remery_> Interupt his cuddling
[1:56:38] <DirtyPopcornJ> @ThatGuyfromMars true. It has a bunch of plotholes and conversations that just kind of everywhere if you even barely scratch their surface
[1:56:38] <lotharrio> Hanlon was occupied, spooning with a ranger.

[1:57:18] <@A_German_spy> @AngriestPat Did you have Mags bring the Idiot Squad to the firing range?
[1:57:19] <+Rust_Wick> do the brine quest @AngriestPat
[1:57:23] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @DirtyPopcornJ it is the least thought out of the dlc. Unlike OWB where the first half hour is spent in a conversation window
[1:57:29] <Skatedeandre> @kiiiirsten exactly WHOS THE BIG SPOON?
[1:57:34] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> Oh hai Spy

[1:57:43] <%brave_sj> We won't go quietly, the Legion can count on that
[1:57:45] <lotharrio> Oh this one. Nice.
[1:57:46] <Gray_skies1993> @DirtyPopcornJ my best guess is that Obsidian retconned it after the base game was out, just before Honest Hearts came out
[1:57:46] <CrimsonFox777> The Legion's using big mutants now.
[1:57:47] <pimpinahz> THOSE SRE HOT PICKLE JUICE SYRINGE. only the best for NCR LUL

[1:58:26] <+ChestMimik> "This grenade wound looks strangely like a super mutant attack"
[1:58:28] <%CerberusDriver> Just playing hot potato with a grenade, like you do
[1:58:30] <%MaddyCaddy> 8 guys
[1:58:31] <Skatedeandre> Man those dudes limbs probably got tore off
[1:58:33] <xtremegamer80> How do you fuck up that badly?
[1:58:34] <Kataguro> Caesar loves these losers they're getting
[1:58:35] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @Tuskor13 you just sit for an hour finding out how you don't have any of your body parts anymore while a bunch of crazy computers, one of whom has a creepy human fetish, feed lore to you
[1:58:37] <%genowyn> The best thing about this game is you get to talk to Akihiko a lot
[1:58:38] <%MaddyCaddy> Well IRL about 8 guys
[1:58:41] <%Heatonist> a squad can be up to 8 guys
[1:58:45] <+Meiou> they were playing hacky sack with a grenade i guess
[1:58:47] <Conky89> What were they doing? Playing hacky sack with the grenade?
[1:58:50] <lotharrio> Well you gotta figure in the "reality" of the setting, that people die from bleeding to death and stuff.
[1:58:50] <%DirtyGaijin> @kiiiirsten The Pat sleep experiments
[1:58:52] <%genowyn> The worst thing is that you have to talk to Yosuke a lot
[1:58:52] <+ChestMimik> "nobody died" is a worryingly vague statement
[1:58:52] <lozscat> Didn’t keep their spacing
[1:58:55] <Cobaltor_252> man doing this quest with fast travel turned off was a bitch

[1:58:59] <+Radical_Steven> FAKE
[1:59:00] <+StromkoPenguin> They were in a circle playing russian roulette with a hand grenade. It didn't work very well.
[1:59:04] <Gray_skies1993> I think the deal with their hats is that they're hollow inside and only the bottom part sits on top of the head, creating the illusion that they all have floating hats/massive heads

[1:59:35] <DirtyPopcornJ> @ThatGuyfromMars I have a love/hate relationship with OWB. It has the best writing but I feel like gameplay wise it just drags on a weeee bit too long for some reason. I don't find it fun to go through in replays but that's just me
[1:59:36] <CrimsonFox777> Going off of the U.S. army details, a squad is about 10 people. That seems a bit much for a grenade.
[1:59:37] <+Tylermcd93> @Sphincter_Spelunker Sorry, WHO should I cum to tonight

[2:01:37] <%NME_Dom> on a balcony
[2:01:37] <xtremegamer80> @manwithboxonhead Beat him up then ask questions?
[2:01:38] <%graffitisamurai> @angriestpat fyi b you can't get the good ending for this quest if you haven't dealt with Caesar
[2:01:39] <%Shindeil> So glad I never got into Bethesda's RPG's. Was never a fan of them.
[2:01:40] <%CerberusDriver> im fed up WITH DIS WURLD
[2:01:42] <eco419> Pio pio
[2:01:43] <+ChestMimik> Then the supermutants trained the deathclaws
[2:01:43] <%ThatGuyfromMars> Hanlon probably has the most famous VA in the game
[2:01:44] <dekkitout> it be like that
[2:01:44] <RollCritFail> The balcony balcony balcony......
[2:02:01] <daisymaisy02> Smart
[2:02:03] <SpookySpaghooti> he looks like Ocelot
[2:02:04] <ScreamingMeat> He has a bad ass gun
[2:02:04] <Gray_skies1993> @AngriestPat so, the best end to this quest is to confront Chief Hanlon and convince him to stop falsifying reports by telling him about Caesar's illness. BUT of course, that option is bugged, so this quest sucks since there really isn't a "good" way to resolve it.
[2:02:06] <CalderGaming> ey chiff
[2:02:07] <%graffitisamurai> Good
[2:02:11] <$cureneckbeard> what's up chief liar
[2:02:12] <eco419> Yo chiff
[2:02:13] <shevan123> aw leave the old man alone he didnt do shit
[2:02:13] <dukenux> who's voicing him ?
[2:02:14] <DirtyPopcornJ> @ThatGuyfromMars The only one I feel nailed the gameplay and writing balance juuuust right was Lonesome Road. It's just long enough and the gimmicks are fine
[2:02:16] <+Tylermcd93> Who voices Hanlan?
[2:02:22] <SpookySpaghooti> is his VA unique?
[2:02:28] <Gruhunchously> Kris Kristofferson bitches
[2:02:30] <OwlLightningMage> BibleThump
[2:02:36] <%kiiiirsten> aqua-ferrrs
[2:02:41] <%rdark_ksu> its just like real California
[2:02:45] <godzookylives> Whistler?
[2:02:48] <%ooblagis> @Gray_skies1993 You can get the good end with the bug fixes Pat has installed. Or by killing Caesar.
[2:02:51] <%CerberusDriver> yes Whistler
[2:02:52] <+Reizie_Etherealm> God damn tuberculosis
[2:02:52] <%kiiiirsten> Now That's What I Call Voice Acting
[2:02:53] <%brave_sj> @Gray_skies1993 You can tell him Caesar is dead, if you've killed him like a real OG
[2:02:57] <dukenux> Yeah, well, Danny Trejo is standing right behind him LUL
[2:03:07] <Doomac> LUL
[2:03:09] <Garry_Guyface> do it
[2:03:14] <%ThatGuyfromMars> It's so weird they got Kristofferson into this game
[2:03:15] <ScreamingMeat> He has A LOT to say
[2:03:38] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @DirtyPopcornJ I have a few issues with Lonesome road but I like it a lot
[2:03:41] <%Corporate_Redeemer> I want his VA to read me bedtime stories
[2:03:47] <%Shindeil> I'M DEFINITELY confused.
[2:03:54] <Gray_skies1993> @ooblagis @brave_sj ahh true, well not accounting for bug fixes I suppose. I never kill Caesar that early, I feel it's more poetic for the Securitrons to kill him.
[2:03:59] <xtremegamer80> Beat him up
[2:04:02] <+Rust_Wick> put jeff bridges in the next fallout
[2:04:03] <Gruhunchously> @Corporate_Redeemer He has a LOT of dialogue in this game. Including a story.
[2:04:07] <+ChestMimik> Why does the sand in your eyes spell out the phrase "Trained deathclaws"
[2:04:07] <Lee_The_Limey> He's phoning it in ...literally LUL
[2:04:08] <MidnightSnack69> this guy has an amazing voice
[2:04:15] <Parapattern> Hanlan's shit makes no sense
[2:04:18] <%CerberusDriver> no Pat just has voice volume down low i think
[2:04:19] <DraxTD> "close your eyes in a sand storm" .. there's your advice @AngriestPat
[2:04:23] <neooneshin> I have never killed Caesar in any of my runs
[2:04:25] <goroke> He's talking in circles
[2:04:36] <godzookylives> Hell they had Kris Krisstofferson so they may as well use him as much as possible
[2:04:38] <%NME_Dom> Hes bullshiting you
[2:04:38] <%ThatGuyfromMars> never forget this guy probably banged Barbra Streisand
[2:04:41] <%Shindeil> Put a big name actor in the next Fallout, then a big scandal makes it so when people look at that game again, they cringe.
[2:04:47] <%kiiiirsten> @ThatGuyfromMars I just choked on my water
[2:04:51] <DirtyPopcornJ> @ThatGuyfromMars like what?
[2:04:58] <DraxTD> Circular logic @goroke
[2:05:01] <%Shindeil> Like Call of Duty did.
[2:05:01] <Lee_The_Limey> ResidentSleeper this guy
[2:05:03] <%ooblagis> @neooneshin You should. Wiping out the camp is super fun, and the game is super reactive about it
[2:05:04] <AstroFalcon09> car ad for pat Kappa
[2:05:07] <%Corporate_Redeemer> @gruhunchously That's fantastic to hear. Reminds me of Rain Falls from RDR2

[2:07:31] <eco419> He is gas lighting you
[2:07:33] <Gruhunchously> Long winded as this guy is, he actually has a good point. It's unlikely that the NCR would be able to hold the dam forever.
[2:07:34] <dekkitout> something something pride, something something war is hell
[2:07:35] <Valdorick> "The legion are putting chemicals in the dam, turning the gotdamned ghouls gay!"
[2:07:35] <tag545> who cares that it is a dream. keep me plugged in logic
[2:07:36] <%FracturedImage> this guy's demented
[2:07:36] <Gray_skies1993> to be fair to Hanlon, I see his point about misdirection, but all of the endings of NV (except the Legion ones) end up proving him wrong
[2:07:36] <Parapattern> He's a fucking idiot
[2:07:41] <%vincerocmm> turn him in
[2:07:42] <kingra> He wants to LEAVE Waaaaaa

[2:08:20] <reinbachthe3rd> I mean, Caesar is still planning on marching on the NCR, so this plan sucks. lol
[2:08:24] <+Exyoh> He's a tired old man who doesn't want kids sent to war forever, which is fair, but...Hoover Dam is legit the magic bullet
[2:08:26] <alrobot2014> is pat gonna make this guy shoot himself for the cool gun?

[2:08:28] <Gray_skies1993> To be fair, he literally gets praised for his actions and Oliver and Kimball get screwed for theirs. Discretion IS the better part of valor.
[2:08:29] <%TheSpiritof2277> He's not talking about just Caesar as a singular person, more like the faction itself. NCR is stretched thin, Hanlon is pretty right
[2:08:32] <Gruhunchously> He wants to get his people out of what he sees as a pointless war. What a pussy indeed.
[2:08:34] <$NocturneNovember> Someone needs to throw Lyle Lovett's lanky ass in a Fallout game
[2:08:38] <%CerberusDriver> war...becomes routine.
[2:08:39] <eco419> Senators?
[2:08:41] <AstroFalcon09> war never changes FeelsBadMan
[2:08:52] <%CerberusDriver> war has changed
[2:08:57] <xtremegamer80> This isn't the Boss's dream
[2:08:58] <Veenok> war never changes tho
[2:09:05] <Valdorick> "I got it, lets give up the damn to the legion, so they can get enough energy to power weapons factories so they can then march on us while we freeze to death in the winter without any power! FLAWLESS PLAN!"
[2:09:06] <%CerberusDriver> but war HAS changed
[2:09:11] <SpookySpaghooti> is this tantamount to treason?
[2:09:11] <Garry_Guyface> War is borring, what if I shook things up?
[2:09:11] <%zerocruz> War has changed Kappa
[2:09:11] <eco419> War keeps changing BibleThump
[2:09:12] <+Nomicro4u> He was bored
[2:09:13] <dekkitout> what part of sea to shining, god ordained, sea didnt he get
[2:09:17] <TheNewJapanGuy> The NCR fucking SUCKS
[2:09:18] <%ooblagis> Which is why someone else should own the Dam after the NCR beats the Legion Kappa
[2:09:21] <+Exyoh> It's stochastic shit-stirring
[2:09:22] <damienlunas> fear and instability never causes any harm.
[2:09:26] <Parapattern> THAT CAUSES HARM
[2:09:26] <thelonechris> Hello, Pat!
[2:09:27] <+ChestMimik> Isn't a boring war a good thing? Well, gooder than exciting
[2:09:27] <%VHLW> shoot em up
[2:09:30] <DSD24> No one stops
[2:09:43] <%SaltyDongs> Convenient
[2:09:46] <%vincerocmm> turn hi m in
[2:09:46] <alrobot2014> no one ever stops
[2:09:50] <Hazard_Kujacker> @AngriestPat So from a lore standpoint is taking over Vegas and protecting the dam a bad Idea for all parties Involved, Mr. Included?
[2:10:08] <Conky89> Lee Oliver basically wants this to be a Hollywood war.
[2:10:20] <%ooblagis> This is the real crazy bit of his plan
[2:10:30] <Gray_skies1993> to be fair to Hanlon, I see his point about misdirection, but all of the endings of NV (except the Legion ones) end up proving him wrong, BUT he literally gets praised for his actions and Oliver and Kimball get screwed for theirs (in the independent ending anyway) Discretion IS the better part of valor
[2:10:32] <Ultimatefool> God I love the Western drawl in this guys voice
[2:10:37] <eco419> This nutjob
[2:10:40] <+khalcipher> kill him

[2:10:50] <Valdorick> "We lose 1000 a year, BUT 50 MIGHT DIE FIGHTING FOR THE DAM! WHAT A WASTE!"
[2:10:50] <%ooblagis> Turn him in, take his gun
[2:10:52] <+khalcipher> get gun
[2:10:54] <SpookySpaghooti> I don't understand his plan, what is he trying to accomplish?
[2:10:54] <ohreekus> Murder him pat

[2:10:58] <tag545> big shoot for da GUN
[2:10:58] <applesonthemoon> you win this one by killing caesar before ever getting to this part
[2:10:58] <Izuurus> don't turn him in
[2:10:59] <Darren716> He's actively gotten people killed
[2:10:59] <%Divryne> What is your MOTIVATION?!
[2:10:59] <shevan123> everyone wants the worst option
[2:10:59] <lionmanguy> What's he even trying to do I'm not following
[2:11:00] <+khalcipher> get gun
[2:11:01] <CrimsonFox777> @AngriestPat Now Pat, remember, 1,900 people are watching and will judge you for your decision.
[2:11:01] <%MaddyCaddy> I believe if you kill him yourself, you fail the quest, so don't do that one
[2:11:01] <The_Blumper> let him live
[2:11:01] <hayden22221> turn him in
[2:11:02] <+StromkoPenguin> The Legion gets stronger with every territory it takes, it's foolish to give an inch.
[2:11:02] <Carnadan> MURDER
[2:11:02] <+ahegotrigger> turn him in unless youre going legion
[2:11:03] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> turn him in

[2:11:10] <%ooblagis> Good call
[2:11:13] <Nulushio> turn him in. hes actually crazy
[2:11:13] <Darren716> Turn in is the best ending for Independant
[2:11:14] <%CommanderSqueaks> @SpookySpaghooti Essentially freak out the troops enough that they decide fuck this and head home.
[2:11:15] <The_Blumper> literally bad ending
[2:11:15] <daisymaisy02> It does fuck over the rangers

[2:11:21] <Kataguro> Bang
[2:11:23] <The_Blumper> good job, bad ending
[2:11:24] <%graffitisamurai> You need to talk to or kill caesar for the good ending
[2:11:25] <greenwashcloth> hit em with a fat man in VATS
[2:11:25] <Darren716> This is the best ending to this quest
[2:11:29] <%nademonkey1100> BAM
[2:11:30] <OwlLightningMage> He's not gonna run BibleThump
[2:11:33] <Darren716> Bang bang bang
[2:11:33] <reinbachthe3rd> I agree the never-ending war part is terrible, but letting Caesar's Legion take the Dam/march unimpeded on NCR territory is fucking lunacy.
[2:11:35] <SpookySpaghooti> @CommanderSqueaks thanks, that seems like it won't work at all
[2:11:36] <+d00msdaydan> she said it!
[2:11:37] <Parapattern> Ceaser is coming for the NCR no matter what

[2:17:10] <Gruhunchously> It's funny, because if you're not with the NCR, you and Hanlon technically have the same goal.
[2:17:12] <Cthulos> Raul's comment was super appropriate. I hope someone clipped that.
[2:17:13] <%TECHNO_OUTLAW> DLC

[2:17:18] <%rumtumtugnutz> You sold Rrataskagar
[2:17:22] <alrobot2014> @ooblagis wouldn't he only need the one bullet?
[2:17:22] <%CommanderSqueaks> @lupus_man His intentions may have been good, but he did so in the absolute worse way that wasn't throwing a grenade into headquarters.
[2:17:27] <%kiiiirsten> Raul is the best
[2:17:29] <%Das_Bass> well that fucks the NCR up
[2:17:31] <Polengoldur> so what does pat think of Darkest Dungeon so far?
[2:17:37] <KoyaMusa> to think this could have all be resolved peacefully but in the end pat must kill
[2:17:41] <+Exyoh> Outer Worlds being compared to KOTOR2 in scale and scope rather than New Vegas just makes me more excited, tbh
[2:17:43] <%ooblagis> @alrobot2014 Nope. Companions use ammo
[2:17:48] <+ChestMimik> @CommanderSqueaks You mean throwing a squad of super mutannts
[2:17:49] <%kiiiirsten> Oh, that guy has commentary on the situation
[2:17:49] <The_Blumper> He wasnt a traitor
[2:17:50] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I want to see EdE shoot more people

[2:17:59] <%MaddyCaddy> There is no good intention in spreading misinformation. It's a waste of tax monies and pisses off soldiers.

[2:28:48] <Darren716> Fun fact pat, if you kill the van graffs after doing the evidence route for Cass's quest she still gets the perm for doing the killing route, but the ending doesnt change

[2:29:27] <%kiiiirsten> @brave_sj 360 no scoping
[2:29:32] <Gray_skies1993> ! DUE PROCESS AT RISK !
[2:29:45] <natebud> Nothing as rewarding as hiding under the table and stealing everything in front of their faces
[2:29:48] <%SpamKingRathalos> You draw the line at theft?
[2:29:50] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Murder!!!
[2:29:51] <+Bloodxb> a real hero
[2:29:52] <Gruhunchously> Killed 10 men and got stopped by a locked door.
[2:29:53] <%SpamKingRathalos> tsk tsk
[2:29:55] <%CubicPhantom> whoa, Patron acquisitions needs their stolen bullshit
[2:29:56] <DirtyPopcornJ> but-
[2:29:59] <%SaltyDongs> kill them dead
[2:30:03] <captainthunderwolf> Theft is a crime, chat, theft is wrong.
[2:30:04] <+ChestMimik> It's not theft if they're all too dead to stop him
[2:30:04] <Conky89> What happened to your kleptomania?
[2:30:05] <ScreamingMeat> You can steal all of it with no repercussions at all. Not even negative karma
[2:30:06] <captainthunderwolf> This was justice.
[2:30:10] <captainthunderwolf> A random act of justice.
[2:30:11] <Klarrann3> I think there's a book in Gloria's room
[2:30:14] <starotter70> Eh
[2:30:33] <Gray_skies1993> hmm, almost like a certain Crusader from Darkest Dungeon
[2:30:33] <GotStomped93> is this remastered? why are the graphics so good?
[2:30:37] <%CubicPhantom> and just stick to wholesome fantasy murder then?
[2:30:38] <%CommanderSqueaks> "It made me crazy and evil, not like now"
[2:30:38] <ScreamingMeat> Van Graff stuff is Karma free
[2:30:42] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Mods
[2:30:45] <starotter70> @GotStomped93 mods probably
[2:30:46] <%Gatzarlok> Pat doesn't want to become the big evil again.
[2:30:46] <Polengoldur> @GotStomped93 mods. a ton of mods
[2:30:47] <alrobot2014> ah so kleptomania makes you crazy and evil, but mass murder, that's kosher
[2:30:51] <natebud> Wow look at the time. Is it time for a DLC already?
[2:30:51] <%LogothX> My cans... my precious antique cans!! What have you done to em...
[2:30:52] <%FracturedImage> it took him like 3 streams to get rid of his very evil karma

[2:31:00] <captainthunderwolf> @CubicPhantom Ding ding ding, we have a winner.
[2:31:11] <%flagi64> why doesnt Pat cheat for good karma?
[2:31:18] <dekkitout> good question
[2:31:23] <%mastertwin2> Looting the bodies isn't bad karma though
[2:31:25] <%CommanderSqueaks> If the game doesn't say it's evil, then it's not evil.
[2:31:25] <%SpamKingRathalos> BIG STEAL
[2:31:31] <+ChestMimik> It's Free Real Estate

[2:32:05] <alrobot2014> @AngriestPat you can shove shit in the mailbox too
[2:32:07] <captainthunderwolf> Any gun merchant that leaves live explosives out in the open probably deserves to be killed and robbed.
[2:32:08] <anAngryHamster> Pat have you farmed up Baruuk yet?
[2:32:09] <+Bloodxb> the plaskacaster

[2:32:16] <Kataguro> Go to Mick and Ralph's
[2:32:19] <%CubicPhantom> pockets filled to bursting with guns and shit
[2:32:21] <ScreamingMeat> I would move all their stuff to their bathroom and steal it all and then sell it back to them. Free money
[2:32:22] <+LegendaryButcher> he got this
[2:32:22] <%Gatzarlok> What happened to your look menu mod?
[2:32:23] <Ion_LaserX> It's still good. It's still good
[2:32:23] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I did this with a stealth boy the instant I got here and made crazy money by dragging myself to the nearest shop
[2:32:24] <Kataguro> Where it can be bought
[2:32:24] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Lie, cheat, steal, murder, maim, kill
[2:32:26] <%SpamKingRathalos> Mick and Shits*
[2:32:28] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Chungo
[2:32:32] <nobknee> @AngriestPat Why don't you cheat and allow infinite weight carry?
[2:32:32] <+louiswho> my neck my back my pussy and my crack

[2:32:34] <%CommanderSqueaks> -Pat with a 300 lbs rucksack on his back- I've got this.
[2:32:35] <natebud> Now wait chat. I want to see where this is going
[2:32:38] <Darren716> Pat just drop the armor and add the caps youd get in console
[2:32:42] <%ThatGuyfromMars> I am back, what did I miss
[2:32:47] <%CommanderSqueaks> *400 lbs rucksack
[2:32:49] <captainthunderwolf> Infinite inventory kind of breaks this game, but I unironically think the game's a more enjoyable experience with it.
[2:32:54] <+AvataroftheSuns> Pat killed everyone
[2:32:54] <%SpamKingRathalos> THE BIGGEST STEALS
[2:32:55] <natebud> Now no one will ever have to know about here whiteface

[2:34:12] <RutilusMonachus> You just used Plasma Pistols to repair the less expensive Laser Pistols
[2:34:13] <nexusj13> Why did he even bother doing the peaceful solution if he was just going to kill them?
[2:34:16] <ScreamingMeat> Laser Tommygun
[2:34:18] <captainthunderwolf> I love the fact that there are a few really uncommon novelty guns you basically need to steal from them to get. If you don't want me to rob someone, you don't leave uncommon weapons out in the open.

[2:37:16] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @DirtyPopcornJ So I took some time to really think about my issues with lonesome road, and it really just kinda came down to ED-E, the interactions with him should've been in the base game, otherwise I'm happy with it
[2:37:17] <natebud> So what's the plan? @AngriestPat
[2:37:19] <%EdgyMacaroon> killing people
[2:37:26] <%SpamKingRathalos> RAT
[2:37:28] <%CommanderSqueaks> Hey, big bonus of the nuclear apocalypse, it kills most things, including bacteria. New Vegas is as clean as it's ever been.
[2:37:29] <%SpamKingRathalos> Kill it
[2:37:33] <%skizzuto> Elmo is smart
[2:37:34] <Conky89> This is just plain robbery that a merchant does not have to give you caps if you go over their limit
[2:37:37] <%doc_ock_rokc> Elmo knows about valentines day
[2:37:38] <mjmanning> talk to that guy in the metal armor by the gate
[2:37:41] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> like he was looking at walking garbage
[2:37:42] <%Remery_> Like a Filthy Peasant
[2:37:44] <captainthunderwolf> There is a nigh-sexual satisfaction to collecting weapons you'll never use in a Fallout game, and no man should be uncomfortable to admit it..
[2:37:46] <mightyfat> You know
[2:37:49] <godzookylives> sipsipHellmo sipsipHellmo
[2:37:55] <OwlLightningMage> Elmo can smell the Red Bull and he does not like it
[2:37:57] <%king_wragles> @Conky89 that limit is how many caps they actually have
[2:37:59] <+louiswho> @captainthunderwolf mmm
[2:38:06] <natebud> just kill orris now

[2:39:04] <%SpamKingRathalos> Style? I style on your fucking grave you goddamn fucking mutant.
[2:39:06] <Conky89> Got no style, got no grace. But you have a funny face.
[2:39:10] <+superbloodwolfmoon> Pat walks in to buildings, and people just assume someone sent him.
[2:39:12] <+ChestMimik> Just throw cinnamin on the act
[2:39:12] <+louiswho> krusty the clown ass
[2:39:15] <natebud> I thought skeletons were supposed to be funny

[2:39:15] <Gruhunchously> World Famous?
[2:39:20] <dukenux> Hadrian? The Wall Hadrian? PogChamp
[2:39:22] <captainthunderwolf> Pissy ghouls are always the best characters in these games.
[2:39:28] <+MechaBaphomet> woo
[2:39:29] <+RJay80> is he calling you a racist
[2:39:30] <%ThatGuyfromMars> World Famous in a world that has ended
[2:39:31] <DSD24> Shit?
[2:39:32] <captainthunderwolf> They are incredibly bitter and it's always super well-justified.
[2:39:38] <+louiswho> yeah
[2:39:41] <Lee_The_Limey> Sorry i didn't recognize you without the face
[2:39:51] <Intolerable> Sounds like Krusty the clown

[2:39:57] <+louiswho> im fucking burnt sorry smoothskin no time for niceties
[2:39:57] <+Cornham> Just eat the contract
[2:39:58] <%CommanderSqueaks> Wait, does Pat have a Mod that make the ghouls look like mini-Titans or was Hadrian always that hideous?
[2:40:00] <Gruhunchously> 'Head' way
[2:40:00] <%yeknomlive> geralt?
[2:40:01] <%SpamKingRathalos> The only thing justified in fallout is the eradication of all mutants
[2:40:01] <Cthulos> Guy sounds vaguely like Krusty
[2:40:01] <OwlLightningMage> Get him a sex robot and he'll cave
[2:40:03] <%snow_bush> They will if they're dead!
[2:40:06] <+Tylermcd93> Just shoot Garret
[2:40:07] <zeroraider> My GUN could talk to him
[2:40:09] <%Das_Bass> you mean the robot fucker?
[2:40:09] <%CubicPhantom> wait what kind of court system even exists here
[2:40:10] <Kataguro> Gotta be James
[2:40:10] <xtremegamer80> Hey Garret, I wanna talk to you in this dark alley
[2:40:12] <$MightyMaxT> So I booted up FF15 again after over a year, less than 2 hours in and I've encountered at least 4 bugs. Characters floating, sword attached to Noctis' wrist, textures not loading. Man, this is killing me
[2:40:14] <Gray_skies1993> Hadrian: “doctor I have this horrible rash” Doctor: “son, that’s called your face!”
[2:40:14] <Huntercd> Are there other countries in Fallout?
[2:40:17] <captainthunderwolf> Francine, I don't like your face. Do you have any unique guns?
[2:40:20] <Gruhunchously> Eh just wait a bit
[2:40:24] <+Cyoctane> Benny!? Poor Max
[2:40:25] <%CommanderSqueaks> Are you in the freezer
[2:40:25] <%doc_ock_rokc> We have to talk to the robot lover

[2:40:36] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> just wait an hour
[2:40:36] <%Niney_Who> I wish I could fuck robots
[2:40:37] <%Mr_Strut> He's up in the fuck place
[2:40:41] <%TheSpiritof2277> have you assumed the position with Fisto yet
[2:40:41] <%mastertwin2> Too busy fucking his robot
[2:40:47] <+Grayhammatter> big in the freezer
[2:40:48] <+ChestMimik> Robot Waifus are nothing to be ashamed of
[2:40:49] <FoxInABeret> @Huntercd The answer is yes, but we know very little about what happened to them after the Great War.
[2:40:51] <Run44forrest> pat killed benny?
[2:40:51] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Das_Bass Do you know how CLEAN it'd be to fuck a robot? He's living the dream.
[2:40:51] <DSD24> What about Joshua Bright?
[2:40:51] <%SpamKingRathalos> Pop her ass

[2:41:28] <starotter70> Hell Yeah
[2:41:30] <DirtyPopcornJ> @ThatGuyfromMars yeah I always found it weird.. Some of the knowledge about E-DE's creator and the whole disassembly IS in E-DE's base quest. It should've been more of a "ED-E why are you here again??" reaction and conversation instead of first-time reactions as if the courier didn't know anything at all
[2:41:32] <+Tylermcd93> @Lukas_Ipsum I heard it was bad tho?
[2:41:38] <+Grayhammatter> GARRET

[2:42:29] <Fujiwara_92> sit and wait
[2:42:29] <+ChestMimik> 7 = 12
[2:42:30] <Lukas_Ipsum> @tylermcd93 saw it today, loved it immensely. I can understand why some might like where it ends
[2:42:30] <%Niney_Who> 7 = 12
[2:42:33] <%Das_Bass> wow, ive played 500 hours of this game and NEVER seen him drunk
[2:42:33] <alrobot2014> @starotter70 half the cast is liam o'brien

[2:42:34] <%CubicPhantom> numbers are hard
[2:42:39] <%SpamKingRathalos> Your ass isn't ready
[2:42:42] <+TONYOO101> the better question then is why havent you got fisto
[2:42:45] <Lee_The_Limey> Would have been funnier if the robot was just a vacuum cleaner Kappa
[2:42:48] <Gruhunchously> Lewd
[2:42:48] <Lukas_Ipsum> *might not like
[2:42:50] <starotter70> @alrobot2014 and Yuri apparently

[2:42:51] <LeNino> Pat is the best Camgirl ever
[2:42:52] <%brave_sj> You need to assume the position

[2:42:55] <%EdgyMacaroon> then your not doing it right
[2:42:56] <+0budha0> Its Valentines go set him up

[2:44:51] <DirtyPopcornJ> @ThatGuyfromMars Dead Money is good it's just HELL to go through again. I liked Dead Money for what it is, but it was fun to go through ONCE . The gameplay changes are unique but too tedius at times. the interest in discovering what is going on the first time in that DLC is great, but once you know it's a slog and a half. I love the Holorifle tho
[2:44:53] <The_Blumper> out of all the people, how come hes embarrassed about sex bots?

[3:21:49] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@Ion_LaserX)
[3:21:50] <%Stevennapalm> California is a shithole
[3:21:50] <reinbachthe3rd> I mean, California has coastal areas/flooding.
[3:21:52] <%DexteraXIII> California is whatever the inhabitants are least prepared to deal with.
[3:21:52] <%TheSpiritof2277> Nestle saved the water, for themselves
[3:21:52] <%CommanderSqueaks> @aimlesshealer I love you too
[3:21:54] <+Grayhammatter> california is so wet, it is drowning
[3:21:56] <%FracturedImage> i live in ca and this state needs to be nuked
[3:21:59] <+taltalheights> California will suffer like G did
[3:21:59] <dukenux> Just gather all the water now, you may want it
[3:22:06] <%awsomesaucekirby> does frozen 2 mean there's gonna be a "let it go" part 2?
[3:22:06] <+sothsis> now mudslides!
[3:22:07] <%nademonkey1100> FUCK EPIC LAUNCHER
[3:22:10] <+MrWrann> We have dams, if they break thousands will die. Dams are fun and terrifying.
[3:22:10] <derap41> Have you played the others?
[3:22:10] <nobknee> California did the bad thing.
[3:22:13] <Nighthawkmun> Learn to swim learn to swim
[3:22:19] <eco419> Yawn
[3:22:21] <lucianon96plays> Hey! California is amazing!
[3:22:21] <dukenux> California... knows how to suffer
[3:22:27] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> THAT'S RiGHT JAY
[3:22:34] <lucianon96plays> no its not it actually sucks here
[3:22:35] <nobknee> LUL
[3:22:38] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[3:22:41] <%joylent_blue> honestly an earthquake could happen tomorrow and no one would know what to do, but thats the gamble we take
[3:22:45] <%awsomesaucekirby> "pay" the rest is different
[3:22:45] <%CubicPhantom> ah more Vul-Paige references
[3:22:46] <%CommanderSqueaks> DO NOT store the Icy Hot next to your lube.
[3:22:48] <Cthulos> California has redwoods
[3:22:51] <captainthunderwolf> Shortening a one-syllable name to a different one-syllable name is madness.
[3:22:52] <$cureneckbeard> nyannAngry
[3:23:01] <+FierceDeityGabriel> Reset brain
[3:23:10] <lucianon96plays> Califor ia also has amazing Mexican food.
[3:23:12] <derap41> Brain.exe has stopped working
[3:23:12] <%Prism_Wing> California knows how to party
[3:23:15] <%awsomesaucekirby> @CommanderSqueaks yes, store it INSIDE the lube
[3:23:19] <%CubicPhantom> Elmo already pilots Paige
[3:23:20] <+ChestMimik> Drive Paige like in Ratatouille
[3:23:21] <%FracturedImage> California also has a rampant homeless problem
[3:23:22] <ScreamingMeat> Elmo would be Legion
[3:23:23] <OwlLightningMage> Elmo loves Ronin cause he scream
[3:23:23] <eco419> EMLO pilot <3
[3:23:25] <derap41> I can't write .exe?
[3:23:30] <%SpamKingRathalos> Paige is the best thing since sliced bread
[3:23:32] <%Remery_> Scorch
[3:23:36] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> The short one
[3:23:38] <jj_cabo> Ronin
[3:23:41] <lucianon96plays> @fracturedimage and don't you forget it buddy.
[3:23:42] <%Biwaifu> that's not a question
[3:23:42] <Cthulos> Swordy
[3:23:44] <%bevyrage> none of them scream
[3:23:45] <%CommanderSqueaks> @awsomesaucekirby I'm going to do that to the next relationship I want to nuke from orbit.
[3:23:46] <Valdorick> Trick question - he'd be a kaiju.
[3:23:49] <+Cavumentum> When's the FO76 Stream Pat
[3:23:50] <DrMoose7> he doesn't need one
[3:23:52] <%TheSpiritof2277> Which one's the loudest
[3:23:54] <Neo_Kaiser> Paige would pilot Tone cause it's easy.
[3:23:54] <+paladinstarbuster> Good tone
[3:24:01] <%awsomesaucekirby> Elmo is a ZOID
[3:24:03] <eco419> Yes
[3:24:10] <+ChestMimik> CHARGIBG STAR
[3:24:12] <%bevyrage> scorch, tone, and legion is a good setup
[3:24:13] <ScreamingMeat> Because big and burning
[3:24:14] <+SuichiTanaka> Scorch, definitely
[3:24:16] <%CubicPhantom> can't fault that opinion
[3:24:16] <%KiariLunaris92> well i learned how to sub xD
[3:24:16] <+MrWrann> Scorch is a nerd with a one shot gun
[3:24:23] <%xS1D3SW1P3x> Scorch is king
[3:24:24] <%joylent_blue> Scorch is a cool name
[3:24:28] <OwlLightningMage> I could never get the hang of scorch
[3:24:28] <nobknee> @AngriestPat Don't worry, none of you will have to make this choice about Titans again. Kappa
[3:24:29] <+ChestMimik> One SHot is all Scorch needs
