[0:06:21] <%samTUMZlettuce> Ride the horse backwards...
[0:06:22] <%Ipsenscastle> @BoxNavy the ps1 version has a bad translation. Best way to play is an emulated psp rom with an anti-slowdown patch, which is a faff
[0:06:26] <rcand9> short range bow unlike tactics
[0:06:26] <%dkzk21> She even riding a big chicken.
[0:06:31] <%samTUMZlettuce> Side saddle with a FAKE LEG.
[0:06:43] <%Bluwizard21> Llyod from tales of symphonia?
[0:06:47] <+Ne0nF0xx> He's a bloodborne character
[0:06:47] <LordOfThePoultry> hes a buff bot
[0:06:50] <%Ipsenscastle> I wish they'd just rerelease war of the lions with the slowdown fixed. Is it so much to ask?
[0:06:53] <%Bluwizard21> follow it with tiger blade
[0:06:53] <%BoxNavy> @Ipsenscastle ill try messing around with that thanks
[0:06:57] <%Ranryu692> is she standing on the bird's back?

[0:07:07] <OneThousandTomatoes> good music
[0:07:13] <+OwlLightningMage> Or Fiery Beast
[0:07:15] <+RunoEddie> maybe you can try to target enemies beyond the shown range with the bow? this is how it worked in TO, if you stood in a very high place the arrows could get anywhere
[0:07:20] <LordOfThePoultry> LUL

[0:08:56] <%dkzk21> Oh
[0:09:00] <Aydarkzero> @Aeonknight_87 good bait
[0:09:05] <%dkzk21> It's got that Octopath Traveler charge mechanic.
[0:09:07] <+Ne0nF0xx> @sweetestbeefs yeah that was the point
[0:09:13] <$RealThiele> fire counter sounds dope
[0:09:16] <%samTUMZlettuce> ... Okaaay...

[0:09:23] <Kokebear> tactics ogre vibes
[0:09:26] <%KeiganOfAstora> Back from dinner. What genre is this? Turn Based RPG?
[0:09:27] <+OwlLightningMage> This game looks really good
[0:09:33] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> Dude, this musicis straight from the 2004 Tetsujin 28 show
[0:09:34] <inkandamber> This OST sounds so brilliant.
[0:09:36] <TheNix> I am really into this
[0:09:36] <inkandamber> I want dis
[0:09:37] <+RunoEddie> I'd really want to check if arrows could target enemies beyond the shown range, like how it worked in Tactics Ogre
[0:09:38] <+SpookyCookieMonster> Anna best girl already
[0:09:39] <rcand9> yea
[0:09:39] <+johnny_gogo> Getting massive FMA vibes from this music and i love it
[0:09:43] <+OwlLightningMage> I like how unique every class feels
[0:09:44] <LordOfThePoultry> yeyeye good old spear attacks
[0:09:46] <+paladinstarbuster> visions of seth
[0:09:49] <%KeiganOfAstora> Music sounds like FMA: Brotherhood yea
[0:09:51] <%chiazam> WAS THAT VERGIL
[0:09:53] <%samTUMZlettuce> I want a turn based action scene in a movie. Every character has agency AND rank.
[0:09:54] <zecht89> this music tho
[0:09:54] <rcand9> i LIKE this A LOT
[0:09:57] <+OwlLightningMage> This music is really good

[0:10:06] <+SpookyCookieMonster> Edwaaaaaaaaaaard
[0:10:06] <%dkzk21> Honestly I'm getting the sense that the charge mechanic is better suited for this type of game than a traditional turn based RPG.
[0:10:08] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> 86% miss, LUL
[0:10:10] <LordOfThePoultry> XCOM BABY

[0:19:08] <%samTUMZlettuce> It's not about failing a mission. It's about how BADLY you fail that mission, the first time... Wait...
[0:19:09] <%cache_22> What is "R3" > Secret Weapon?
[0:19:10] <%HitchhikingThrough> I like how he was about to send roland in again
[0:19:11] <rcand9> rolland kinda babby weak
[0:19:15] <%rumtumtugnutz> get good, etc
[0:19:25] <LorcaNomad> this music is fucking good though
[0:19:26] <+Ne0nF0xx> can't believe pat locked himself out of ultima
[0:19:32] <%watts121> man this music is fucking killing it
[0:19:33] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Move the Eagle to High ground
[0:19:36] <%rumtumtugnutz> Roland is a soft baby child
[0:19:41] <%DashXero> They probably have permadeath in this game...
[0:19:53] <Ragnorok64> Does the demo have dual audio?
[0:19:56] <lets_be_friendos> catJAM
[0:19:57] <heartlesshealer> Could leave him mid-way to buff your party or maxwell
[0:20:03] <rcand9> i cant wait to download this myself
[0:20:03] <%emperordread> I know kin, but what's a kith?
[0:20:08] <KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt Maybe it's a good idea to let your magic users use magic, and keep shield man close to your guy you should protect
[0:20:08] <%rumtumtugnutz> Stab him in the mummy-daddy button
[0:20:21] <+terry_quest> healer in frontline?
[0:20:28] <olaksi> selects healer "gotta send you up front"
[0:20:35] <%samTUMZlettuce> In Fortain yes.
[0:20:37] <+OwlLightningMage> Healer should tank everything
[0:20:45] <+Ne0nF0xx> @KaiserMario how dare you give good advice. you know what stream this is
[0:20:48] <heartlesshealer> @emperordread Kith is more towards friends or family-like friends, while kin is blood relatives
[0:20:58] <Sunstalker> This feels like a cleric beast/ludwig remix. paliHappy
[0:21:02] <%SuckerPunchSyd> @emperordread friends is Kith
[0:21:05] <%emperordread> @heartlesshealer sweet, thank you very much
[0:21:15] <heartlesshealer> You're welcome!
[0:21:16] <%samTUMZlettuce> ^
[0:21:18] <%emperordread> likewise @SuckerPunchSyd
[0:21:18] <+OwlLightningMage> Healers are basically tanks without the defense or damage. Ideal tank alternates
[0:21:26] <sweetestbeefs> shes dead lmao
[0:21:27] <KaiserMario> @Ne0nF0xx LUL yeah, I can't help it, I'm so dumb...
[0:21:28] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Ye!
[0:21:29] <LorcaNomad> backstab is guaranteed crit is it?
[0:21:29] <+LeRouch_the_Rebel> ***
[0:22:19] <heartlesshealer> Okay, archers seem to be very powerful flank attackers
[0:22:26] <%samTUMZlettuce> Until that.
[0:22:35] <LorcaNomad> I've always wanted to punk people in my tactics games
[0:22:36] <sweetestbeefs> I BACKSTAB YOUR BACKSTAB
[0:22:36] <$lotharrio> That's one of the oldest strategies. Just fucking surround a guy and beat on him.
[0:22:38] <iambqb> Beating on your pals, it's a life lesson
[0:22:59] <%DashXero> Annie, are you OK?
[0:23:00] <Aydarkzero> monkaS

[0:23:59] <sweetestbeefs> it hit 3 people tho
[0:24:06] <+CharredChord> it changed the tiles under them.
[0:24:06] <+OwlLightningMage> That guy is super dead
[0:24:08] <%watts121> that's the prince Pat!
[0:24:09] <heartlesshealer> environmental effects from magic is still neat
[0:24:17] <$lotharrio> What if you combine the numbers though?
[0:24:19] <+1000CypherZ> Sounds like they will be nailing the music again.
[0:24:24] <corepercentlives> sure
[0:24:34] <+Ne0nF0xx> pat stop sending your mages to the front lines
[0:24:34] <sweetestbeefs> IT MELTED THE ICE THO
[0:24:35] <%aishman> @PatStaresAt They did say the demo was more difficult than the actual game.
[0:24:36] <Retrash> oh neat the ice melted
[0:24:38] <%Agami23> holy shit
[0:24:39] <heartlesshealer> okay, character has to stop on the square to pick up then
[0:24:39] <sweetestbeefs> thats pretty neat
[0:24:44] <heartlesshealer> melted ice into water
[0:24:44] <%LouieRouie> but there's a puddle now

[0:24:57] <+Euphbugg> LUL
[0:25:00] <%Agami23> the ice spell made ice on the ground and the fire spell melted the ice on the stage
[0:25:02] <heartlesshealer> no lightning magic in Pat's demo party right now
[0:25:04] <$lotharrio> Pat, why'd you put them there?
[0:25:13] <Blank9> the dude said he'd handle the reinforcements
[0:25:15] <Aydarkzero> bummer
[0:25:17] <%DashXero> Wait... There's no friendly fire?

[0:28:06] <Aydarkzero> LOL
[0:28:11] <LorcaNomad> Pat you really expect the mages to do good melee damage LUL
[0:28:12] <zecht89> books don't hurt that much pat

[0:28:57] <cammiedrawcraft> a kith is what u give to your thignificant other
[0:28:57] <+1000CypherZ> The music is actually making me want to finish Octopath Traveler.
[0:28:58] <Severteran> Nah, this is a different flavor altogether. Disgaea is over the top and dramatic, with an engine made to be broken. This just seems like the end result of what would happen when you combine fire emblem and octopath.

[0:30:59] <%pectusumbra> yeah you can shoot people in the back, naturally
[0:31:01] <%M4T1A5> isn't shooting in the back still a backstab
[0:31:01] <%samTUMZlettuce> I would LOVE to see the QA notes on that...
[0:31:07] <olaksi> @TaylOctopus91 be more specific
[0:31:19] <Aydarkzero> LUL
[0:31:19] <%RyTYoung> Or a Mii costume at least
[0:31:22] <Severteran> And why does that one guy sound like the FMA brotherhood narrator?
[0:31:30] <sweetestbeefs> WHAT WOULD FATHER do
[0:31:30] <ape_hawk> yeah, but ladder-horse isnt a sword user, so its not gonna happen
[0:31:31] <Aydarkzero> the King from earlier?
[0:31:32] <%samTUMZlettuce> He'd take his horse up a ladder, I bet.
[0:31:33] <+paladinstarbuster> @olaksi wordsworth
[0:31:33] <inkandamber> WHAT WOULD CHOESE DO
[0:31:37] <%BoxNavy> hes probably super dead\

[0:31:40] <beefcakemanthrob> this music took a turn
[0:31:40] <+NobleJedi> I don't either FeelsBadMan
[0:31:42] <%emperordread> His dad is the King who was about to get pwned
[0:31:43] <sweetestbeefs> what would my DADDY do
[0:31:48] <Aydarkzero> least the Prince is safe up there
[0:31:53] <inkandamber> Wait, wtf!?
[0:31:55] <m1a_gunner> say he went for smokes and never come back
[0:31:57] <JetpackMcQuack> Horse fingers too strong
[0:31:57] <%linSP> I saw the direct and I already forgot who was announced
[0:31:58] <%samTUMZlettuce> Is there a Former Horse?
[0:32:00] <TheNix> It'll be really funny if that ladder horse gets defeated again
[0:32:01] <inkandamber> I missed the horse scaling a ladder!?
[0:32:04] <OneThousandTomatoes> they did say triangle strategy is a working title, so what if they just came out and said it was ff tactics 2 later
[0:32:05] <phatmac16> How is the game so far?
[0:32:09] <inkandamber> BEST TACTICS GAME EVER!
[0:32:16] <TheChewDawg> Full. Metal. Alchemist.
[0:32:19] <TheChewDawg> Fullmetal Alchemist.
[0:32:19] <cammiedrawcraft> guys these are some pro strat triangles
[0:32:21] <Severteran> This is a pretty long fight
[0:32:24] <+OwlLightningMage> The music is so good
[0:32:26] <Jariu> Watch them jsut keep the tittle like with Octopath
[0:32:27] <Clundy> Better than Wargroove?
[0:32:30] <Aydarkzero> any weapon triangle in this so far?
[0:32:32] <%cache_22> Can you save mid-fight or is there no save scum ability in this demo?
[0:32:33] <+TaylOctopus91> @olaksi Lol, I don't know the name, but it was a white horse dude, and I think he had like a vintage military sport coat with the epaulets?
[0:32:34] <KazamiArt> Honestly the music is really nice for this type of fight
[0:32:40] <%sniffy77> i think that enemy got THE POINT
[0:32:45] <bahble> music rules
[0:32:46] <Aydarkzero> or just straight up based on stats etc
[0:32:54] <Thalchampz> @Severteran i think it's the usual time length of a tactics game
[0:32:56] <+OwlLightningMage> ANOTHER HEAD CHOPPED OFF
[0:32:57] <heartlesshealer> oh hey, a climb skill
[0:33:31] <%samTUMZlettuce> Don't provoke people, PAT.
[0:33:36] <%Encrouched> das it
[0:33:37] <ape_hawk> HUH THATS IT?
[0:33:50] <%samTUMZlettuce> Climb a ladder with your horse first AT LEAST
[0:33:54] <+0ni0n_L0rd> These characters could use more barks, this is already getting annoying
[0:33:56] <sweetestbeefs> this game is already repeating itself LUL
[0:33:57] <+OwlLightningMage> That line is so stupid
[0:34:02] <%M4T1A5> that line is going to get old really fast in the full game
[0:34:02] <NeroIscariot12> he's gonna die again. that guys health is at half
[0:34:05] <ItsJustShawn> you'll get caught up in the: horsepower
[0:34:09] <Aydarkzero> LUL
[0:34:10] <%Xelhesia> lol
[0:34:13] <%BoxNavy> ladderhorse....
[0:34:13] <DingusMcBaseball> horse just disappears
[0:34:14] <sweetestbeefs> I already hate the protagonist
[0:34:14] <inkandamber> That is so fucking dumb, hahaha
[0:34:16] <%samTUMZlettuce> Found it.
[0:34:18] <+CoolguyChris105> The power of the blink horse
[0:34:19] <m1a_gunner> horse took the elevator
[0:34:20] <+waltzqueen> @PatStaresAt heal prince?
[0:34:27] <$lotharrio> Broke his fucking leg with that arrow.
[0:34:29] <%samTUMZlettuce> Well done Shawn
[0:34:37] <heartlesshealer> Your characters have many diamonds, what even is hawk dive with your sword twink?
[0:34:46] <ItsJustShawn> is he Orlandu?
[0:34:50] <Severteran> Guys, I don't think he held back
[0:34:53] <+Ne0nF0xx> why would you ever heal the character that needs to be protected?
[0:34:54] <KaitlynnHere> “Gotta show off for yuki-Chan”
[0:35:05] <Pyrrhus90> ah yes, the super op unit at the start of the game
[0:35:06] <+OwlLightningMage> That guy will die or betray the party
[0:35:09] <+Doctor_Stew> holy shit, is this the soul and spirit of FFT?
[0:35:10] <%samTUMZlettuce> Like Mrs.Doubtfire.
[0:35:11] <$lotharrio> I see an octopath to victory.
[0:35:25] <KaitlynnHere> @samtumzlettuce good one
[0:35:36] <+OwlLightningMage> Super OP early units always die or betray the party
[0:35:45] <sweetestbeefs> DO YA SEE THAT
[0:35:48] <+lordericter> I'm a genius...OH NO
[0:35:50] <Supwizy> I wonder why square didn't just make this a FFT game
[0:35:57] <+applemon198> This looks like it channeling a whole bunch of FF tactics
[0:36:00] <inkandamber> Is that Johnny Yong Bosch
[0:36:09] <Severteran> The horses are one thing, but these birds are just cheating.
[0:36:09] <%Broand> Dude your dudes can only hold 5 magic points, don't forget to spend them so you get more next turn
[0:36:19] <+OwlLightningMage> CaReLeSs
[0:36:19] <Calamity2007> Is this made by the Octopath guys?
[0:36:21] <Pyrrhus90> or they become mediocre mid game
[0:36:31] <%Monkeyweed21> she has a better heal now
[0:36:34] <%cache_22> I wish it had the character health bars on the portraits at the bottom.
[0:36:37] <Explodincatz> it looks like after 20 years they finally made a good FFT game
[0:36:39] <NeroIscariot12> Roland is on half hp too. he's gonna die again LUL
[0:36:43] <Jariu> This looks very much made by BUsiness Division 11
[0:37:02] <olaksi> no friendly fire huh
[0:37:03] <%DashXero> No friendly fire...
[0:37:05] <OneThousandTomatoes> I mean its a triangle staregy is at working title so its technically possible it will be called fft2 later
[0:37:06] <+OwlLightningMage> Someone clip when Pat lets him die again
[0:37:12] <Severteran> That dudes seems so over the top
[0:37:12] <corepercentlives> 2 shots
[0:37:13] <heartlesshealer> no friendly fire :0c
[0:37:14] <robotman37> damn no friendly fire?
[0:37:18] <+Ne0nF0xx> hes got honor AND hes the dawnspear
[0:37:20] <%DashXero> The lack of friendly fire makes me kinda sad.
[0:37:27] <Explodincatz> there needs to be an always show health bars option
[0:37:30] <%samTUMZlettuce> The best punchlines are quantum.
[0:37:31] <heartlesshealer> @robotman37 not with magic at least
[0:37:48] <Jariu> Watch them add friendly fire if enough people tell them to
[0:37:50] <%TamsynRRD> TamsynRRD subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 37 months! Hey Pat! Just saw the new Rise trailer. Super excited for a new temnoceran. Gives me hope for a returns of large bug monsters.

[0:37:58] <LyricalMaki> suggest friendly fire to the devs in the feedback review guys!
[0:38:05] <+LionKagura> SourPls
[0:38:05] <+applemon198> Could this really be set In Ivalice or take place after the tactics ending from 14? It’s so tactics like
[0:38:06] <%RadDude6969> RadDude6969 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months! 
[0:38:18] <SupportWriter> You mean tactics ogre
[0:38:22] <+Ne0nF0xx> Maybe a toggle option for friendly fire for the more casual audience?
[0:38:43] <iambqb> They might do a difficulty thing like Dragon age where friendly fire is on harder modes
[0:39:03] <$lotharrio> Maxwell, slowly getting murdered.
[0:39:13] <ToBais91> enemies can pick up the loot?
[0:39:19] <TheNix> leaving behind so much loot. Not that it matters in a demo, but

[0:57:57] <%Monkeyweed21> oh man you are going to LOVE Hitman 2
[0:58:02] <%bassoontyphoon> !CEREBRAL VASCULAR INTEGRITY AT RISK!
[0:58:03] <+waltzqueen> @Gregorhasjoined AND SELLING IT TO KIDS
[0:58:19] <mortalmanbaby> i like Byleth too
[0:58:22] <%BoxNavy> looking at rex just pisses me off
[0:58:22] <%AncelDeLambert> Xenoblade 2 was a snorefest
[0:58:27] <bahble> that trailer was good tho
[0:58:27] <DetroitSentai> XBC2 is really fucking good
[0:58:28] <%Monkeyweed21> at least Byleth is from a good game
[0:58:28] <BlueBiscuitGT> RANT
[0:58:29] <gildor0> thats hurtfull...
[0:58:32] <%BogBodyPositive> @waltzqueen I CHARGE FIDDY FOR AN OUNCE
[0:58:32] <BlueBiscuitGT> Let's gooo
[0:58:32] <%samTUMZlettuce> Say it
[0:58:33] <Ragnorok64> you sure about that?
[0:58:34] <+TopTieramisu> s w o r d f i g h t e r
[0:58:34] <SinisterBroccoli> Idk I see way more porn of those two new characters
[0:58:36] <rei0> xc2 was a disappointment to me
[0:58:38] <%Buzzard42> I popped off for Pyra
[0:58:42] <bahble> xenoblade 2 has incredible combat tho, like holy shit it was incredible
[0:58:43] <%AncelDeLambert> 30 hours until robot?
[0:58:43] <%Ranryu692> people like Pyra WAY MORE than they like Byleth though
[0:58:44] <%Buzzard42> XC2 owns
[0:58:46] <+OwlLightningMage> Dante is never coming to Smash
[0:58:46] <%Mitalis> I dunno, I genuinely enjoyed the Xenoblade Chronicles series
[0:58:48] <+D00msDayDan> the logistics are simpler in dyson sphere program than factorio because you're exploiting a whole-ass star cluster
[0:58:49] <$SGrim> They took the sword.
[0:58:50] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Do it yeyeye rant
[0:58:51] <+Tumpatill> I'm more excited for Xenoblade than FE
[0:58:51] <%linSP> what even is xenoblade except boobs
[0:58:52] <%AzureGale> Xenoblade 2 is a gacha game minus the microtransactions
[0:58:52] <%samTUMZlettuce> boom
[0:58:53] <%BoxNavy> he SUCKS
[0:58:55] <DetroitSentai> Rex is great
[0:59:01] <%caramelatte1> God his voice in the reveal blegh
[0:59:05] <%greasypete00> because the real mc is boring and is some of the actual worst english va ive heard
[0:59:05] <redrins> uh you can play as mythra in the dlc right?
[0:59:05] <CurrySauseBandit> When did Rex suck? Tf
[0:59:05] <heartlesshealer> oh boy
[0:59:07] <BlueBiscuitGT> YER DUN!
[0:59:07] <%Buzzard42> Rex is AWFUL
[0:59:08] <$SGrim> I like Rex because he's shit
[0:59:10] <Gregorhasjoined> @waltzqueen I charge fifty for an ounce, and my dad used to fuck me rippidy dee~
[0:59:10] <%Monkeyweed21> Rex has the WORST design and voice
[0:59:12] <%Buzzard42> Nia though andyEyes
[0:59:12] <%kewlmyc> His outfit and EN VA are bad
[0:59:13] <%greasypete00> they shouldve added zeke smh
[0:59:17] <Dommykins> double the tiddies double the value
[0:59:18] <KazairLux> Rex is trash
[0:59:19] <%Xelhesia> x is fantastic
[0:59:21] <%AzureGale> Why not give us the Torna protag
[0:59:22] <%kyh9> Rex is cool, but I like Pyra and Mythra
[0:59:27] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> but he sleep like a baby
[0:59:27] <%tank7013> Rex has "We'll beat them with the power of friendship" as a normal battle line. Fuck Rex
[0:59:28] <%ssjklyco> Since the characters are actual swords, it's a double sword user
[0:59:29] <%Buzzard42> it should have been Noa
[0:59:30] <%Buzzard42> Nia
[0:59:31] <%Monkeyweed21> EVERYONE ELSE IS BETTER
[0:59:32] <%kyh9> Eyyy, fuck you pay
[0:59:33] <+demon1103> No, this isn't as bad as Byleth. This is just...oh meh, Byleth was You Ended the first pass on Another Fire Emblem!!!!
[0:59:35] <DetroitSentai> Dont play the dub for XBC2, it was made during the VA strike which is why the english dub is very rough
[0:59:40] <+Tumpatill> Don't give a shit about either tho
[0:59:41] <%cvp5127> the dub voice sucks
[0:59:42] <%kyh9> Rex is cool, but his VA is weak is al
[0:59:43] <%emperordread> Don't let it set in
[0:59:43] <gildor0> he gets better after like 50 hours lol i wish i was kidding and i love xenoblade 2
[0:59:46] <%Mitalis> I liked XC2's combat system, but for the love of god, I wish the characters would STFU
[0:59:46] <Aydarkzero> they should have added Crash but i'll never get a character i like in Smash FeelsBadMan
[0:59:54] <Wizardism> Pyra has boobs, that makes her 10x better
[0:59:58] <%kyh9> Rex is good, his VA is just really weak, especially early on
[0:59:58] <%TheDullaMAN> Rex looks like a side character from FFTA2
[0:59:59] <+razielhex> HAT KID FOR SMASH. NEVER GIVE UP!
[1:00:01] <%YakumoYomi> Byleth was a letdown because they came at the tail end of a DLC pass full of third-party characters. Fighter Pass 2 is arguably worse
[1:00:09] <%kyh9> But Pyra and Mythra are more popular for obvious reasons
[1:00:22] <%kyh9> I mean, Melia is more popular than Shulk
[1:00:25] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> @PatStaresAt you skipped my dono tooooo T__T
[1:00:26] <Condidas> @DetroitSentai thanks for the tip. was gonna start playing xbc2 becaues of the reveal

[1:00:48] <TheSphereHunter> VF is coool!
[1:00:48] <Big_Dream> nope
[1:00:49] <Aydarkzero> @PatStaresAt how would you react if a Virtua Fighter made it into smash?

[1:00:58] <%MidnightBurst12> ok grandpa
[1:00:58] <%Puhff> cuz fuck you that's why
[1:00:58] <%AzureGale> jk VF is p cool
[1:00:59] <%DashXero> It's all right Pat. Some of us already know VF is cool.
[1:01:00] <%Spydurman> no one would be here though LUL
[1:01:00] <+OwlLightningMage> That Virtual Fighter announcement is gonna happen any day now LUL
[1:01:00] <%FaderPotater> I played VF back when I was a baby with a saturn
[1:01:01] <%TheDullaMAN> Don't promise what ain't true, Pat
[1:01:02] <+Ran196> play VF pat, show us how cool it is

[1:01:09] <%samTUMZlettuce> haha
[1:01:11] <+OhioNitsud> vf is cool but i hate fighting gmaes
[1:01:11] <%FaderPotater> I was even young enough to be in the market for VF kids
[1:01:12] <pricklypissant> It is. But for now it's our punching bag.
[1:01:13] <+D00msDayDan> i wouldn't you can't make me
[1:01:14] <DetroitSentai> @DetroitSentai Yeah it's a shame, because the catgirl character is actually a fantastic welsh voiceactress but the rest of the cast doesnt hold up. Even moreso since XBC1 had a fantastic dub
[1:01:19] <+XatheFlare> echo fighters but its an entire roster of a fighting game as one character
[1:01:19] <+quackisalive> I had Virtua Fighter as a child and it put me off fighting games for life.
[1:01:19] <viewtifulr> so 5 people including yourself Kapps

[1:01:37] <+TopTieramisu> nioh 2 is fun until you have to manage your inventory
[1:01:40] <SinisterBroccoli> how does Nioh 2 run on PC?
[1:01:41] <%Ranryu692> please no

[1:02:35] <s1rcuit> a 5 year old woke from one recently
[1:02:42] <@SoFarFetched> I see someone watched Kennylauderdale video
[1:03:10] <%Bt_Robot> That was an amazing video
[1:03:15] <+Veraverse> The climate is actually changing
[1:03:19] <+KaseTriedAgain> Hey @PatStaresAt Just raided with about 5 people. Wish it could be more to support my favourite internet person but I'm only small kasetrYuukiHeart
[1:03:22] <%KeiganOfAstora> @PatStaresAt Hey for your weed do you prefer Indica or Sativa?
[1:03:29] <%AncelDeLambert> the main issue is that wild swings in climate occur. Like MASSIVE BLIZZARDS
[1:03:29] <%samTUMZlettuce> FACTS
[1:03:31] <+OwlLightningMage> The world is fucked. We are all doomed
[1:03:31] <%Bt_Robot> Dude got me into Chargeman Ken
[1:03:33] <%emperordread> AND Ted Cruz
[1:03:33] <%Evil_John_Cena> @PatStaresAt i'm aware for the record, just thought it was funny
[1:03:36] <%samTUMZlettuce> HAHA
[1:03:36] <%UvBenServed> But why cold tho?
[1:03:39] <+razielhex> "Global Warming" was a canard developed by the 70s by conservatibe Republicans
[1:03:40] <+D00msDayDan> i kept a snowball in a freezer for 6 months so climate change isn't real
[1:03:44] <@SoFarFetched> @KaseTriedAgain all raids big and small are appreciated here psaDab
[1:03:45] <%AncelDeLambert> in other words: support nuclear power
[1:03:46] <%Monkeyweed21> I live in a place where the air turns orange
[1:03:49] <%linSP> world is a fuck, play vidya
[1:03:50] <OldManDeckardCain> climate change is also a terrible term, climate has been changing since before humans existed LUL
[1:03:51] <+TopTieramisu> texan republicans are blaming frozen wind mills FailFish
[1:03:57] <+UltraViolet371> you've been right a lot today, what is this
[1:04:02] <%cvp5127> shame texas doesnt believe in global warming
[1:04:07] <%samTUMZlettuce> ^ It's so stupid...
[1:04:14] <+KaseTriedAgain> @SoFarFetched Doing whatever I can, It is hard to be noticed nowadays <3
[1:04:15] <+razielhex> @OldManDeckardCain Which is why the full term is "Anthropogenic Climate Change"
[1:04:17] <%BoxNavy> is it the tomorrow thing?
[1:04:24] <%samTUMZlettuce> Painful
[1:04:25] <+razielhex> or Anthropocentric
[1:04:29] <+OwlLightningMage> Pat is gonna announce that he got the RE game early
[1:04:33] <+TopTieramisu> i love that their pride and joy, their own independent energy grid, has gone tits up
[1:04:44] <%BoxNavy> hohh
[1:04:50] <OldManDeckardCain> @razielhex no one uses that tho LUL
[1:04:55] <%TamsynRRD> Climate change is happening. It's ALWAYS happening. The issue of human impact is so politicized, however, that it's impossible to tell the real data from the numbers fudged for one side or the other.
[1:05:07] <%samTUMZlettuce> ^^^^^
[1:05:19] <%Xelhesia> ye
[1:05:23] <+razielhex> @OldManDeckardCain Because politicians can't pronounce anthropocentric and don't care to know what it means; they're not elected for their intelligence.
[1:05:24] <Tuna_Can_0> is it super seducer?

[1:06:06] <%s_xylocalsingles> @PatStaresAt thats the NEW plot. old plot was countries fight through League
[1:06:07] <%Monkeyweed21> they redid it
[1:06:07] <%AncelDeLambert> it's completely broken and makes no sense
[1:06:07] <+jiggy_snipe> yes but the message is correct
[1:06:12] <$SGrim> Old Lore
[1:06:15] <Dommykins> There's no real plot it's just sorta a world where characers hang out in
[1:06:16] <%Ranryu692> he said ORIGINAL plot
[1:06:17] <+spacenoido> they completely retconned it lol
[1:06:17] <Crouton18> league lore is trash
[1:06:17] <%Cozy90> league has a plot??

[1:06:20] <scrimscromble> dont pretend LoL lore ever made sense
[1:06:21] <%SvenHolgersson> @PatStaresAt They tried to make it make sense and retconned it to shit yea
[1:06:24] <UnfilteredComic> The ORIGINAL PLOT, they retconned it hard
[1:06:26] <%PhysicsLB> psaDogchamp
[1:06:26] <%BoxNavy> :)

[1:06:58] <%ChungusQuest> to be a man you must have honor, honor and a peeeeeeeeeenis
[1:06:59] <Daxalog> The old plot to League of Legends was just "we took the badasses we know in rumors and bring them here to fight for us to settle politics".
[1:07:00] <%BoxNavy> the spiders
[1:07:00] <%Cozy90> shin chanis great wtf
[1:07:01] <CommanderCOOL> 60 bucks for skyward sword...jesus help us
[1:07:02] <+OwlLightningMage> honor and a penis
[1:07:07] <+skylerpilot> yeah I don't think the actual game of LoL: Summoners Rift, etc has any bearing really in league current lore
