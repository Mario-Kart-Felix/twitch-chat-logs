[0:02:59] <sgtglucose> Big Pat #1 Gamer Award
[0:03:17] <sgtglucose> Excellent Pat Gaming Time
[0:03:50] <%justcallmebobplease> I hope Pat talks, even in passing, about Reggie completing Dark Souls today.
[0:04:08] <DaKnightWarrior> Yo lytCIAO
[0:04:11] <%justcallmebobplease> Guy beat Kalameet, Manus, DOUBLE SANCTUARY GUARDIANS, and then went and killed Gwyn to finish the game, in one stream!
[0:04:14] <%XzileGaming> you hope Pat talks? geez
[0:04:19] <%EynoStiles> Merry Christmas Pat & Chat! 🎄
[0:04:19] <%XzileGaming> will you be excited
[0:04:40] <sgtglucose> Maybe Pat Will Finally Shit
[0:04:48] <%justcallmebobplease> @XzileGaming Oh, just the most excited - if he 'wahs', I shall mark out.
[0:04:49] <@GeneralSCPatton> Let's fucking go!
[0:05:19] <knight_verse> Oh hey, Pat's streaming... this should give me enough time to watch the last Nioh 2 stream before he begin playing, great.
[0:05:45] <%XzileGaming> yeah, thats how long the intro will be, youre right
[0:05:46] <%JoshManVGH> I love how utterly and completely destroyed this goblin is, at least in this one instance. It didn't even survive halfway through the first stream
[0:05:56] <oda_flobunaga> Namesake day
[0:06:05] <+Prism_Zet> I'm in montreal awaiting my food order good timing
[0:07:02] <Profmcstevie> Orb goes to Japan 2, I made it in time
[0:07:37] <%Hamborgini> I think Nioh 1 might have been invalidated within the first 20 minutes of stream 1
[0:07:41] <RubberFistFight> fucken ads, holy shit
[0:07:56] <+shry7> @justcallmebobplease how did reggie feel about the ending?
[0:08:09] <RubberFistFight> @Hamborgini I still think he should play it after finishing this one. The lessons learned from 2 will translate well.
[0:08:09] <GhoulishCripple> i bought the DLC. splitstaff is mad busted
[0:08:17] <%NoHoldsBarredProductions> r e l o a d
[0:08:28] <GhoulishCripple> like low stance masterful strike Shin strike
[0:08:32] <GhoulishCripple> ki Destroyed
[0:09:10] <%justcallmebobplease> @justcallmebobplease He explicitly acknowledge that he now GETS why Dark Souls is the phenom it is, he was taken wholly aback by the legitness of it (behind the jank, naturally).
[0:09:12] <oda_flobunaga> The only Nioh 2 weapon that is kind of bad/weird is the hatchets.  Everything else is absolutely badass
[0:09:23] <%justcallmebobplease> Reggie, this day, became a Soulsborne Mark
[0:09:27] <%justcallmebobplease> HARD
[0:09:42] <+shry7> @justcallmebobplease thats awesome
[0:09:54] <Aydarkzero> huh new intro neat
[0:10:26] <%Hamshot> Hamshot subscribed with Prime. 
[0:10:39] <GhoulishCripple> @oda_flobunaga nah hatchets are good too. the free projectile attacks have some weird properties. like the spinning throw pins enemies in place for its duration
[0:10:57] <%chance_h> Pat, Pog!

[0:17:14] <%chance_h> The bosses got the macro wrong, you're expose to use "Standard Touch" not "Bad Touch"
[0:17:18] <%Evil_John_Cena> what happens first? ubi fixing their multiple problems or them making a good assassin's creed game again
[0:17:24] <%IamGrapes> "rapey video game company" sadly doesnt narrow it down

[0:19:43] <+rafaelba93> nioh tiiiiime
[0:19:47] <IvanMistwalker> @rubberfistfight unfortunately every Disney touches makes too much money NotLikeThis
[0:19:54] <chickenhand> Matrix 4 was fine, it just could have been better.
[0:19:55] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> Was that the shortest donation read?

[0:20:05] <%jackythefrost> @king_wragles NIOH2 CAME OUT IN 2019
[0:20:06] <RubberFistFight> @IvanMistwalker except their child stars Kappa

[0:20:22] <%valriot> dont worry, game will make you sweat soon
[0:20:23] <Profmcstevie> Drape the hoodie over your shoulders

[0:20:26] <+Stormzcales_Lair> sucks, need a long sleeve shirt
[0:20:30] <%UvBenServed> Need a snuggie
[0:20:34] <IvanMistwalker> @rubberfistfight LUL
[0:20:37] <%patriotrenegade> you look like a fucking nerd

[0:20:44] <%king_wragles> dab

[0:20:54] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> Snuggies are great and I'll fight anyone who says they're stupid.
[0:20:58] <%jackythefrost> Damn

[0:22:51] <RubberFistFight> RETURN TO MONKE
[0:22:53] <atlasdotwav> Oh God I already see why there is goblin management in this game
[0:22:59] <%PocketBearIllustrator> @nigelschnauzerpug that'd be nice for the cold days.
[0:23:14] <Profmcstevie> When Team Ninja make da RPG mechanic they make ALL of them
[0:23:20] <IvanMistwalker> Goblin Garbage
[0:23:46] <@GeneralSCPatton> FYI, equip load is one of the only things with a soft cap, and it plateaus real hard.
[0:23:47] <%PocketBearIllustrator> oh, this is made by Team Ninja?
[0:23:54] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt just remember you can use your high level items to soulmatch your gear if you get a set of affixes that work well for you.

[0:24:13] <KatabolicRage> those training missions give you locks and sometimes unlock skills on the tree
[0:24:15] <Profmcstevie> The boobies and brutal blade based violence wasn't a tip off this was Team Ninja? LUL
[0:24:22] <%Axellogic> Also makes your yokais skill inflict poison
[0:24:24] <RubberFistFight> Yes, pat, do the dojo tutorials
[0:24:27] <RubberFistFight> they unlock skills and stuff
[0:24:29] <+Dariel111> dont need life drain if u dont take damage
[0:24:48] <atlasdotwav> Iponder those orbs
[0:24:54] <%PocketBearIllustrator> @profmcstevie I missed the boobs part here. :P
[0:24:54] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt when you die it has a chance to just auto-fetch your bloodstain for you.
[0:24:56] <HoboFlea> I love the life drain + poison combo. Used it for 90% of the game.
[0:25:03] <artoflec> he's feral though so you'll have to readjust to that 👀
[0:25:11] <%Agami23> different yokai counter though
[0:25:56] <Profmcstevie> @PocketBearIllustrator ah, well yeah the snake ladies got it going on with no shame
[0:26:10] <defaultname3887> i don't he has learned the different yokai counters
[0:26:12] <srv4254> ferals my favorite its a good panic dodge
[0:26:16] <%Axellogic> do good ninja
[0:26:20] <%YakumoYomi> Ninja, ninja rap?
[0:26:41] <DragonOfWarZro> Im pretty sure katou danzo was actually a hot girl puppet
[0:26:47] <%PocketBearIllustrator> @profmcstevie I mean, if you got em, flaunt em.
[0:26:48] <RubberFistFight> @Profmcstevie go check out "nure onna nude mod" on nexusmods to see just HOW MUCH they have it goin on.

[0:27:33] <IvanMistwalker> snek is cool
[0:27:35] <Who_lio42> @patstaresat you can switch weapons in dojo missions, u just have to equip them in the mission
[0:27:38] <RubberFistFight> @artoflec oh boy is there. And it's tasteful/not excessive, too. it mostly just removes the hair from their boobies and gives them nipples.
[0:28:02] <artoflec> nice elaBased
[0:28:17] <RubberFistFight> @Profmcstevie I get laid plenty, I just like my snake ladies extra sexy, bite me.
[0:28:54] <artoflec> they're so gross 😩
[0:29:04] <IvanMistwalker> LUL
[0:29:07] <%king_wragles> @Who_lio42 good job
[0:29:07] <%patriotrenegade> do it
[0:29:09] <%Axellogic> only certain dojos
[0:29:11] <Who_lio42> oh I guess not this one lol
[0:29:17] <%moonmintparadise> LUL LUL
[0:29:17] <+JustToWatch> press it with more feelings
[0:29:19] <%patriotrenegade> why arent u doing it
[0:29:21] <HoboFlea> lol
[0:29:24] <%TenraiDaze> LUL
[0:29:26] <RubberFistFight> lol the fucking mission description straight-up says "you can ONLY USE PROVIDED EQUIPMENT"
[0:29:26] <%Axellogic> most dojos dont change your weapon type though
[0:29:27] <Who_lio42> THE ONE
[0:29:28] <%Puhff> git owned one guy
[0:29:31] <%IamGrapes> crazy talk on chat
[0:29:32] <artoflec> maybe not that one because it was the magic one LUL i dunno
[0:29:32] <%PocketBearIllustrator> I'll just be here being the bars tiddie connisuer that I am. :P
[0:29:38] <+ThisRebelLion> Hey, how's pat doing with Nioh 2? I absolutely love the game, but really felt for his struggle with the first game.
[0:29:41] <%PocketBearIllustrator> bara*
[0:29:45] <Profmcstevie> Pat why did you break the game to prove a chat person wrong how coooould you
[0:29:45] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> you must become the sasuke
[0:29:50] <%Axellogic> learn bombs I guess to farm points later
[0:29:55] <%valriot> Ones on the left
[0:29:56] <scrumbotime> shuriken and bombs actually are pretty good
[0:29:57] <DragonOfWarZro> He's doing bad
[0:29:58] <+Local16> @PatStaresAt Left side is damage spell stuff
[0:29:58] <RubberFistFight> @ThisRebelLion well he knocked the snake boss over in 2 attempts and it was baller
[0:30:00] <RubberFistFight> so he's doing alright
[0:30:02] <%IamGrapes> get the ninja star
[0:30:02] <%jackythefrost> This is a game made by the same guys who make DoA and Ninja Gaiden. Theres plenty lewd in this game
[0:30:05] <@GeneralSCPatton> Hemlock broth is a decent buff
[0:30:07] <srv4254> bombs and elementals are good
[0:30:07] <%CatastropheCorvid> Top and left.
[0:30:10] <%Blank9> bombs are ok, free damage projectiles
[0:30:10] <%Axellogic> Ninja moves are redic damage if you spec into them
[0:30:12] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> Go for quiet running!
[0:30:14] <artoflec> some of the bombs and shit have useful status effects, thats mostly what ninja stuff is about.
[0:30:16] <%CatastropheCorvid> Ninjutsu is fantastic
[0:30:16] <shiny_prinny> feest
[0:30:17] <+HuoShengdi> bombs are good for the slimes
[0:30:26] <%valriot> The lightning feathers are so strong, theres a seperate sppedrun tier without them LUL
[0:30:32] <+HuoShengdi> and the damage ninjutsu can get ridic
[0:30:32] <%MyshkaMysh> @PatStaresAt The Ninja Elemental Feathers can be fairly OP later on.
[0:30:39] <+Local16> Ninjutsu ended up with the best damage spells this time instead of onmyo
[0:30:41] <HoboFlea> Ninja and Onmyo are great. They outright trivialize bosses if you happened to have specced right beforehand.
[0:30:44] <RubberFistFight> @jackythefrost Not to mention that a lot of yokai-related artwork and japanese artwork in general likes to interplay sex/eroticism and horror.
[0:30:45] <%epide> poison bomb can be good its to the right side
[0:30:47] <+ThisRebelLion> @ThisRebelLion Well that's rad- the snek boss can be a real noob stomper!
[0:30:47] <%Blank9> only problem with fist is a lot of moves have same inputs, so you have to pick and choose what's equipped
[0:30:53] <defaultname3887> i just want him to se the other counters
[0:30:55] <%Axellogic> I always look at my movelist customization screen and check what buttons I dont have filled out yet
[0:31:03] <%PhantomMiG> @patstaresat If someone has not suggested from the skill list if you see something cool it will show all the prereqs ypu need
[0:31:05] <KatabolicRage> I mean, if moves use the same input you just spread them across the stances
[0:31:06] <%jackythefrost> @PatStaresAt If its trash, dont worry, respecing in this game is both very easy and very cheap
[0:31:07] <+McSoliace> you should see the follow up to takedown 2
[0:31:09] <yyyyfdugyu> nioh or yiehs
[0:31:49] <%Axellogic> Life bonuses on the left side
[0:31:56] <%Blank9> green skills are modifiers you equip to other moves you buy
[0:32:07] <SaltyAzteca> you gotta invest in the good stuff
[0:32:13] <applefibs> oh shit waddup!
[0:32:17] <+meatmaaan> so many skills are just step ladders to better skills
[0:32:24] <srv4254> barrier godly
[0:32:30] <%Axellogic> YOu have to equip the green skills on your skill menu or they dont do anyhthing.
[0:33:07] <%superc37> stingers alright
[0:33:07] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[0:33:15] <%BlackStarAura> psaDogchamp
[0:33:18] <RubberFistFight> WHAT A MYSTERIOUS JUTSU
[0:33:29] <+HuoShengdi> Katana gets a stinger too but it's a boss drop
[0:33:42] <%patriotrenegade> you do it
[0:33:42] <HoboFlea> barrier is very highly lit
[0:33:42] <Profmcstevie> Nioh seems like it can almost match Monster Hunter in "between mission management"
[0:33:51] <+HuoShengdi> I lucked out and had it drop the first time I beat that boss
[0:34:04] <martinhadameme> Boss drop moves are probably the worst thing in this game imo
[0:34:09] <DragonOfWarZro> No, its waaaaay more
[0:34:11] <%Axellogic> Press square to equip them on a skill
[0:34:21] <shiny_prinny> you can apply the modifier to one skill in each weapon
[0:34:23] <artoflec> so basically you add passives to individual SKILLS too
[0:34:24] <+BlackSunEmperor> the green skills are also per weapon
[0:34:28] <%valriot> No, its 1 per
[0:34:29] <@GeneralSCPatton> Yes, the green ones have to be slotted onto 1 other move
[0:34:30] <%Axellogic> YOu can only put it on one skill at a time
[0:34:31] <KatabolicRage> green skills have a downside which is why you can do that
[0:34:34] <%Hamborgini> you can only equip a skill to one ability
[0:34:35] <%cade_calrayn> O_O
[0:34:40] <%cade_calrayn> I never knew about this
[0:34:44] <+HuoShengdi> You can only use them once per weapon yeah
[0:34:45] <%VentWilsn> VentWilsn subscribed at Tier 1. 
[0:34:46] <RubberFistFight> Yeah you're essentially setting a movelist
[0:34:47] <KatabolicRage> so for that one it increases the ki consumption
[0:34:48] <%Blank9> yeah honestly the green skills are not very good until later
[0:34:48] <%Axellogic> You can have them on multiple weapons though
[0:34:53] <+HuoShengdi> they increase the ki cost of the move tho
[0:35:03] <+Local16> @PatStaresAt You'll unlock a bunch of them so you can vary up how your skills work based on your preference
[0:35:04] <RubberFistFight> @cade_calrayn how did you miss it, it's literally a core part of the game
[0:35:04] <+HuoShengdi> and there can be other downsides
[0:35:07] <%Blank9> otherwise they may suck your ki up like crazy
[0:35:13] <martinhadameme> A lot of this stuff is more for NGP
[0:35:25] <%Axellogic> Keep in mind the green skills also increase how much ki they consume
[0:35:29] <%cade_calrayn> I missed the part about having to equip the skill like this
[0:35:34] <artoflec> ninja gaiden plus
[0:35:40] <%cade_calrayn> like I bought the skill but never used this menu to apply the green skill
[0:35:48] <%Axellogic> Just the one stance
[0:35:52] <RubberFistFight> But it tells you to go do that...
[0:35:55] <didgereedoodah> I didn't realize this was a thing until DotW
[0:36:06] <artoflec> ur doin great Pat
[0:36:06] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt make sure you check your titles/prestige too.
[0:36:11] <RubberFistFight> you get extra stuff
[0:36:13] <martinhadameme> NG+ is where you start doing silly builds with the green skills, custom crafted armour and weapons, and soul cores
[0:36:22] <longtom21> damn so happy to see Nioh 2
[0:36:24] <Slimeking_Mike> It's Nioh Time, Baby!
[0:36:26] <IvanMistwalker> GOBLIN NEURONS ACTIVATED
[0:36:35] <%Axellogic> Its basically backwards the forge
[0:36:37] <longtom21> I'm currently on Demon and getting wrecked haha
[0:36:48] <martinhadameme> NG+ in Nioh 2 is honestly some of my favourite NG+ content in video games
[0:36:51] <Profmcstevie> Damn nice sheathe
[0:36:51] <%TerpanderLux> TerpanderLux subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 25 months! hey pat its boxnavy. just wanted to say new monk fuckin owns. still clunky but its great :)
[0:37:01] <%epide> did pat get any rep points yet
[0:37:08] <defaultname3887> am allways amazed by people inability to read calmly
[0:37:15] <RubberFistFight> @epide he has em, he just hasn't spent em
[0:37:20] <DragonOfWarZro> I got to DotN and said Fuck that
[0:37:21] <RubberFistFight> the menu has an exclamation mark on it
[0:37:22] <+HuoShengdi> I'm like 300 hours played and doing underworld lol
[0:37:24] <%Axellogic> Charging bull has to deplete ki on hit on a human enemy but its SUPER cool when it does
[0:37:36] <%epide> k thx
[0:37:36] <captainnathaniel> @PatStaresAt you should watch videos about the insane combos people make on this game
[0:37:37] <+ThisRebelLion> god, i love charging bull
[0:37:38] <+HuoShengdi> katana + dual katana almost the entire time
[0:37:41] <SaltyAzteca> TRUST THE THRUST
[0:37:56] <longtom21> the fast version of moonlit snow is crazy good in Nioh 2 xD
[0:37:58] <RubberFistFight> @HuoShengdi i did a katana/dualswords build
[0:38:00] <martinhadameme> My favourite thing about Nioh is that each weapon basically has an infinite if you can get your stagger ability high enough
[0:38:02] <RubberFistFight> good fun once i got a handle on it
[0:38:06] <+HuoShengdi> but I have played with all the weapons enough to unlock pretty much all the moves
[0:38:10] <captainnathaniel> @PatStaresAt so you can see the things you will never be able to achieve
[0:38:11] <%Hamborgini> just watch some sunhi legend gifs instead
[0:38:12] <%Axellogic> Eh id let Pat just play dont wanna risk them panic attackoids
[0:38:12] <SaltyAzteca> ohhhh hes invested
[0:38:16] <artoflec> i wonder if you're gonna transmog every odachi to this design, its so cool
[0:38:16] <longtom21> bought the game 2 years ago and recently have chance to play it
[0:38:18] <%JoshManVGH> Good on you yo keep a nother goblin dead!
[0:38:19] <%IamGrapes> because it's like watching insane combos in devil may cry
[0:38:22] <%TerpanderLux> thats always fun :)
[0:38:27] <%IamGrapes> its cool to watch
[0:38:38] <%TerpanderLux> umi boobzo
[0:38:43] <%retrosadness> more like umi bozo
[0:38:46] <martinhadameme> I did Scythe/Dual Swords
[0:38:47] <%JoshManVGH> Just spitting weapons
[0:38:55] <martinhadameme> Scythe was so busted early on
[0:38:59] <%cade_calrayn> zangief does not approve of the umi bozo
[0:39:03] <artoflec> i bet theres a mod that just makes umi bozus look like one big boob too
[0:39:07] <%JoshManVGH> Remember when he was a terrible boss.
[0:39:25] <martinhadameme> Nioh 1 has a couple terrible bosses
[0:39:25] <Profmcstevie> Son of a bozu, you mean nothing to me
[0:39:32] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> YEYE IT'S THE MISSION WITH HER
[0:39:34] <PrinceOfEden> I loves me some Nioh, but I found myself less invested in 2 due to the story and how much easier it felt.
[0:39:40] <PrinceOfEden> Still a great game though
[0:39:47] <martinhadameme> Luckily 2 has some of the best bosses I’ve played in video games, especially the DLC bosses
[0:39:52] <longtom21> PepeLaugh feather abuse
[0:39:52] <%valriot> LUL
[0:39:54] <%Axellogic> Tsundere
[0:39:57] <%TerpanderLux> oh :(
[0:39:59] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> YEYEYEYEYEYE
[0:40:00] <SaltyAzteca> bri'ish version of her though
[0:40:01] <%valriot> b-baka
[0:40:01] <%superc37> hai beat girl
[0:40:03] <+HuoShengdi> tsun tsun lady
[0:40:11] <DragonOfWarZro> Well British people are monsters
[0:40:12] <SaltyAzteca> STRANGE EMOTIONS
[0:40:14] <captainnathaniel> they could have made the tsundere less abvious
[0:40:17] <shiny_prinny> it's not like i wanna slay yokai with you or anything, b-baka
[0:40:20] <longtom21> tbh
[0:40:22] <%Hamborgini> tsundarinit
[0:40:23] <Profmcstevie> Tsundere but she actually doesn't like you, LETS GOOOO
[0:40:27] <%VentWilsn> bruh
[0:40:40] <%VentWilsn> SHE SAID THE LINE
[0:40:41] <tanarath> GOD
[0:40:42] <longtom21> the worst boss in this game is probably that Odachi dude Saito Toshimitsu
[0:40:50] <srv4254> did pat ever find out the switchglaive is a trick weapon
[0:40:57] <+HuoShengdi> oh god fuck that guy!
[0:41:00] <captainnathaniel> she is just the TSUN
[0:41:11] <martinhadameme> @longtom21 Is that the ice boy?
[0:41:11] <artoflec> oh god i know that sound elaPain
[0:41:15] <HoboFlea> praise the tsun
[0:41:16] <longtom21> oh shit my bad, spoiler myself
[0:41:19] <+HuoShengdi> glad he's completely optional
[0:41:23] <%TerpanderLux> 🐍
[0:41:28] <didgereedoodah> if by worst you mean the most difficult
[0:41:35] <%Axellogic> I feel like high stance strong attack on odachi has too much recovery considering its damage is middling its just not godlike like Axe's
[0:41:39] <DragonOfWarZro> Magic odachi man? He can burn in hell
[0:41:44] <RubberFistFight> @longtom21 are you kidding? That boss fight is incredible.
[0:41:50] <srv4254> odachi guy is added content tho right
[0:41:59] <longtom21> @martinhadameme no, the one from side mission, he died later on mission. I can only abuse Tonfa/Fist on higher NG++
[0:42:02] <thepardack> Fuck magic odachi man.
[0:42:03] <%superc37> so does pat know that the ippon datara hammer move is a great way to break heads/horns?
[0:42:04] <+HuoShengdi> he's cool to fight but he's super hard
[0:42:12] <%epide> ikr i love that one
[0:42:19] <longtom21> @longtom21 I personally hate that boss tho
[0:42:20] <RubberFistFight> oh wait hang on is he the onmyo-spamming input-reading cunt?
[0:42:24] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> rekt
[0:42:24] <nipplestheenchilada96> what is with that bloodborne scythe? thats cool as hell
[0:42:26] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Dead
[0:42:26] <RubberFistFight> coz yeah if so he can suck a fat one
[0:42:26] <%TerpanderLux> that dude was for real monkaS
[0:42:28] <$SGrim> Obliterated
[0:42:29] <+HuoShengdi> yes
[0:42:31] <%Axellogic> You got defeated at your own odachi game
[0:42:31] <+tempestzephyr> girls were watching
[0:42:35] <DragonOfWarZro> Get fukked
[0:42:39] <%Hamborgini> looks like he did the odachi betterer than you
[0:42:40] <%TerpanderLux> ya
[0:42:46] <martinhadameme> My favourite boss is birb boy
[0:42:46] <artoflec> what did Mumyo see between you dying and respawning at the shrine
[0:42:46] <shiny_prinny> he had big toughness stat
[0:42:49] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> in front of the waifu as well
[0:42:50] <Profmcstevie> Odachi superiority
[0:42:55] <%BlackStarAura> lol
[0:43:03] <+dystopian_boyfriend> nioh 2 is the best souls game, maybe. fight me about it
[0:43:04] <%Axellogic> fast ass ki regen
[0:43:05] <%ChrisPlaysThing> At least 1 fertile human being saw that failure
[0:43:16] <cheapdoc> How's the goblining?
[0:43:19] <srv4254> barrier is cocaine for ki
[0:43:31] <Mixoops> his odachi was bigger then yours and she saw
[0:43:33] <martinhadameme> Nioh’s best bosses are when you go up against dudes who can do what you do, it’s the only game with multiple different Vergils throughout
[0:43:52] <RubberFistFight> dude feral burst counter is the fucken best
[0:44:09] <%Axellogic> oh yeah cause you changed spirit the timing is a lot tighter
[0:44:24] <artoflec> yeah and ive never REALLY understood how it says it needs to hit your after-image
[0:44:28] <Zombrocom> The best thing about feral burst counter is you can use it as a emergency dodge when you run out of stamina
[0:44:34] <efratzy> could never get the hang of feral, ending up sticking with phantom
[0:44:36] <%ChrisPlaysThing> @martinhadameme humans of near identical ability must now call themselves Vergils and Dantes
[0:44:36] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt the dodge forward actually gives you an effective way to get through moves you were too late to otherwise avoid, provided you can get a handle on the timing
[0:44:37] <%TerpanderLux> yo thats a big punch
[0:44:38] <+sonofrobin73> Its really the best. As long as you are hit during the I-frames it counters and gets you out of danger
[0:44:40] <thepardack> I only did 2/3 DLCs, the ones I did were cool. That last one's first boss let me know that I wasn't gonna have a good time.
[0:44:42] <%zarkazeon> !uptime
[0:44:42] <@Moobot> @zarkazeon I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 44m 54s.
[0:44:44] <Sonny_Firestorm> Are you fucking kidding me? Pat skipped straight to 2?
[0:44:46] <%TerpanderLux> monkie :)
[0:44:50] <+ThisRebelLion> i like the power oni burst more than feral, but it really is apples and oranges- they're both good
[0:44:59] <%Axellogic> IT also uses more ki so the recovery is likely offscreen
[0:45:07] <ToneBacas> oh
[0:45:08] <didgereedoodah> phantom is my favourite
[0:45:08] <sirrice77> @artoflec all it means is you need to dodge INTO an attack. As in if an attack is gonna hit you just use the counter to move into it's hitbox
[0:45:09] <%Deft_Thought> DAMN
[0:45:09] <nipplestheenchilada96> SMOKED
[0:45:10] <%TerpanderLux> oof
[0:45:13] <+sonofrobin73> you can also use feral to get out of drained ki, or as an additional dodge
[0:45:16] <+hrudzie_1> burst counter will interupt being winded
[0:45:16] <+Zinri_Luck> no block for u
[0:45:17] <%Axellogic> You can go into negative ki if you use alot
[0:45:19] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> what urple gear does to a mf
[0:45:21] <RubberFistFight> got yer ass beat
[0:45:22] <captainnathaniel> it just takes one error
[0:45:23] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Shuffled off this Mortal Coil, for FREE
[0:45:25] <+lokillotowers> Hey Guys! I have a massive quandry. I wanna get into the Yakuza series but am clueless on where to start, or what to even buy. What do yall recommend?
[0:45:27] <+tempestzephyr> balls on stream
[0:45:27] <HoboFlea> that guy is a big hitter dang.
[0:45:30] <artoflec> he got a purp
[0:45:31] <+hrudzie_1> you can burst while winded and it will move you
[0:45:31] <DragonOfWarZro> Pat is a filthy part skipper
[0:45:32] <%justcallmebobplease> Because fuck you, that's why.
[0:45:34] <ToneBacas> drank all the milk
[0:45:35] <%Blank9> yeah all the modifiers have a "ki use x1.2" or something like that
[0:45:36] <%TerpanderLux> hes stronger than time itself
[0:45:39] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> He believes
[0:45:40] <nipplestheenchilada96> that phantom really said *points down*
[0:45:42] <+Zinri_Luck> use fist and rushdown him to get rid of his ki
[0:45:42] <President_valentine> @lokillotowers 0 or Kiwami
[0:45:43] <srv4254> yakuza 0 everytime
[0:45:44] <+Javaa01> Anyone is strong on counter hit
[0:45:44] <%Axellogic> Odachi user's in heavy armor can be tough cause they dont stagger as easy
[0:45:46] <+HuoShengdi> player phantoms are always tough
[0:45:47] <artoflec> @sirrice77 okay, that makes sense, i would sometimes dodge away, because then my after image would be where i WAS right? so that confused me
[0:45:52] <%Dew217> yakuza 0
[0:46:07] <GhoulishCripple> I did discover there is like half a second where you can't use Feral dodge to cancel out of stamina recovery, but it's still faster than normal or with the winded recovery ability on your armor
[0:46:15] <DragonOfWarZro> Cause you are not worthy as his opponent, streamer
[0:46:22] <thepardack> Yeah probably Yakuza 0. Yakuza 1 is...kinda bad
[0:46:24] <sirrice77> @lokillotowers start at 0. Admittedly you'll start at a high point of the series and playing like 3 or even kiwami 1/2 will not be as good but still i think it's okay to start there
[0:46:24] <Sonny_Firestorm> He wasn't stronk, you just didn't respect.
[0:46:27] <RubberFistFight> green?
[0:46:29] <HoboFlea> hey pat, you gain 30% more ki on that pulse, but the move itself costs 20% more. So it's only a minor improvement
[0:46:33] <RubberFistFight> oh you mean your abilities
[0:46:35] <nipplestheenchilada96> collect M O N K E
[0:46:37] <%Blank9> don't bother with them until later
[0:46:48] <%YakumoYomi> While you're were tweaking your StreamLabs settings, he was studying the blade
[0:46:48] <GhoulishCripple> did you assign them in yhe skill customization screen? @patstaresat
[0:46:50] <RubberFistFight> yeah what Blank9 said
[0:46:54] <%Hamborgini> the green buffs are lot easier to understand when you get into the ones that add elemental effects
[0:46:59] <%Axellogic> The green moves just do passive buffs to it. But they increase your ki consumption on use.
[0:47:11] <%epide> idk why she doesnt use more magic even thou she uses an int main wepon
[0:47:13] <DragonOfWarZro> Hey, mumyo got him
[0:47:13] <captainnathaniel> all of that for worthless loot. the nioh experience
[0:47:17] <sirrice77> @artoflec yeah they worded it in a bad way i think but if you do that you'll always proc it just gotta get the timing right and not dodge too early like i do sometimes
[0:47:19] <GhoulishCripple> it does
[0:47:26] <+lokillotowers> so is the order 0, kiwami, kiwami 2, 3, 4 and 5? Its super confusing
[0:47:27] <RubberFistFight> i think you need to get a perfect pulse to see the best return on that one
[0:47:31] <GhoulishCripple> it's like 15 percent on the active skl
[0:47:36] <%Axellogic> Limitless might not work with it too cause Limitless is a static ki use skill
[0:47:45] <longtom21> sooner realize all weapon moves are not on the list YEP
[0:47:47] <+bloodrune8864> You can equip them on multiple weapons
[0:47:50] <%Axellogic> Limitless always uses all your ki
[0:47:51] <%TerpanderLux> monkaS WHEEL
[0:47:54] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> hotwheels pog

[0:48:11] <thepardack> they're the worst shit ever
[0:48:11] <DragonOfWarZro> Its DAT BOI
[0:48:13] <RubberFistFight> introducing this game's skeleton wheel
[0:48:19] <+HuoShengdi> I think this is the first place you can encounter them
[0:48:19] <sirrice77> @lokillotowers yes but remember 3/4 are older than 0 is. Personally i played 3,4,5,0,kiwami 1/2, 7
[0:48:19] <%Axellogic> Snek can hit multiple enemies
[0:48:27] <longtom21> flux and flux 2 are the most important in the beginning tbh
[0:48:31] <thepardack> hammer man down
[0:48:45] <+pectusumbra> okay I clearly missed some stuff after I went off yesterday
[0:48:46] <+Catpurnicus> fighting beyblades over here

[0:52:22] <+HuoShengdi> if it's not a remixed main mission map there may be kodamas
[0:52:29] <Mister_McDerp> wow
[0:52:29] <%PocketBearIllustrator> I gotta head to bed, but I'll see you next time, Pat. Catch y'all later.

[0:52:35] <%epide> at times yes
[0:52:36] <RubberFistFight> this mission made me miserable when i did it
[0:52:36] <+lokillotowers> oof
[0:52:36] <%Hamborgini> the true wheelmonk experience
[0:52:38] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> zeah...zeah

[0:52:47] <artoflec> elaKek
[0:52:47] <+Mooseification> just like the bonewheels
[0:52:47] <defaultname3887> lol lmao
[0:52:52] <IvanMistwalker> Wheels Must Die
[0:52:59] <+Inferno_Icon> yea pretty much only explore if theres kodama in the mission but you can see that before you go in
[0:53:00] <%TerpanderLux> this is good
[0:53:01] <shiny_prinny> but hey, auto grave recover
[0:53:06] <morow1ec> Keeping the spirit of bonewheel sceletons
[0:53:09] <%Axellogic> Blocking is the only way to get out of hitstun in moments like that
[0:53:12] <$grotto_kein> Oh hell yea that boi bovan playing a video game ass video game very cool
[0:53:24] <%epide> you do get the non main spirits from them thou
[0:53:25] <GhoulishCripple> @patstaresat next time you see a Sudama drop a duplicate soul core you have. there's a chance to get something good
[0:53:27] <RubberFistFight> oh no, the desire to rush is setting in
[0:53:54] <%TerpanderLux> corl...
[0:54:02] <Sonny_Firestorm> Wow, he went straight for the DLC weps huh?
[0:54:04] <+Mooseification> you can block while getting hit to stop the hit stun
[0:54:07] <%BlueLunecy> Good ol Grimey
[0:54:07] <%abrupt_abe> The direction of your attack will actually dictate whether or not you hit weak points
[0:54:13] <%JoshManVGH> CAAAARL THAT KILLS PEOPLE!
[0:54:14] <DragonOfWarZro> You can rush if you invest in ninjutsu
[0:54:20] <artoflec> you got THREE purp drops from that though 👀
[0:54:22] <Zombrocom> Well, seething dragon is a pretty cool weapon
[0:54:23] <%chance_h> Imma tell my family that this was Getting Into Fighting games with Pat
[0:54:24] <Zombrocom> Just not for you
[0:54:25] <%Axellogic> its good if you want light armor
[0:54:46] <SaltyAzteca> theres no pvp in nioh 2 sadly
[0:54:49] <%TerpanderLux> lmao
[0:54:53] <srv4254> PAT
[0:54:58] <%Axellogic> fire is hot
[0:55:00] <+bravofifeniner> Funny thing about phantoms, you can accidentally get really good gear from them early in the game.  Kinda broken
[0:55:00] <%JoshManVGH> Get wrecked by fire
[0:55:01] <%Dew217> magic pixel
[0:55:05] <%Puhff> LUL
[0:55:07] <Sonny_Firestorm> True PvP was such a shitshow in the first game they left this game with only revenants for PvP content.
[0:55:15] <%Axellogic> You didnt have to go back into the fire
[0:55:20] <thepardack> Wow that's funny
[0:55:27] <%TerpanderLux> he gets so offended everytime you shoot him
[0:55:34] <HoboFlea> I love that stop-drop-and-roll is a mechanic in this game
[0:55:34] <%CatastropheCorvid> @PatStaresAt When on fire, switch to high stance first. Every dodge is a roll in high stance with your weapon out.
[0:55:36] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> oh nice
[0:55:43] <%Hamborgini> now you are the wheel
[0:55:45] <%Axellogic> Wheelmonk core is very good
[0:55:54] <Zombrocom> I always appreciate it when a game lets you stop drop and roll a fire debuff out
[0:56:00] <%Hamborgini> or as some say, narrow orb
[0:56:02] <+McSoliace> your luck with soul cores is getting crazy
[0:56:03] <%Axellogic> Wheelmonk core is super cheap but can be used continuously if you hold it
[0:56:10] <thepardack> one of my favorite abilities is the one that heals you when you get soul cores
[0:56:12] <Sonny_Firestorm> @CatastropheCorvid Dashes put out fire too.
[0:56:29] <%TerpanderLux> YEEEEEAH
[0:56:32] <DragonOfWarZro> If only you'd use your cores more
[0:56:33] <Zombrocom> Get OWNED wheel!
[0:56:36] <+alphonseisbest> @PatStaresAt hey did u hear Reggie beat DKS1 today!
[0:56:37] <+Zinri_Luck> NICE
[0:56:45] <+Catpurnicus> wheelface skeleton, dadadadadada daaaa
[0:56:49] <%CatastropheCorvid> @CatastropheCorvid Not as quickly, I think.
[0:56:54] <%TerpanderLux> :)
[0:56:59] <%Axellogic> btw the only shrine in this mission is the one at start
[0:56:59] <+Catpurnicus> he beat kalameet like it was nothing
[0:57:00] <%AncelDeLambert> well done, Reggarth

[0:57:18] <%MrBorisMakarov> 8 8.5
[0:57:19] <+ThisRebelLion> Titanite Catchpole Too Stronk
[0:57:21] <Treasure_Vault> He was wrong all the time, 10/10
[0:57:23] <+Malastrome> pvpNice
[0:57:24] <%AncelDeLambert> let's be honest, Reggie took to Souls like a fish
[0:57:27] <%Tearonex> 10/10 he was on point
[0:57:28] <Zebroneath> Woolie did very good at hip guiding
[0:57:32] <Sonny_Firestorm> @PatStaresAt Speaking of which, you need coaching for this game.
[0:57:33] <Profmcstevie> Now he just has Dark Souls 2, Dark Souls 3, Bloodborne, Sekiro, Surge 1, Surge 2, Code Vein, Elden Ring.....
[0:57:37] <+Kyma1020> Good but not enough drop your shields if you know what I mean?
[0:57:37] <Who_lio42> content/10
[0:57:42] <%Axellogic> Woolie spent the entire Artorias fight rooting against reggie
[0:57:43] <DragonOfWarZro> Better than the dude who coached him Kappa
[0:57:47] <+alphonseisbest> nah
[0:57:49] <artoflec> i think pat's doin alright 🤷
[0:57:49] <+alphonseisbest> u good man
[0:57:54] <%TerpanderLux> yes
[0:57:57] <President_valentine> You're doing pretty good
[0:57:59] <RubberFistFight> he did fuckify everything
[0:58:00] <srv4254> surge and code vein smell tho
[0:58:01] <%TerpanderLux> its FUCKIFIED dude
[0:58:01] <penitentpendant> I mean, chat is 'coaching' like it always does
[0:58:03] <%Axellogic> He's the end of the mission at least
[0:58:06] <%Hamborgini> get fuckled
[0:58:07] <defaultname3887> no no you havent

[0:58:11] <@ssjklyco> Didn't Woolie also have good luck on drops during your DS playthrough?
[0:58:11] <Profmcstevie> He activated FUCKIFY INSTALL
[0:58:15] <thepardack> welcome to demon stinktown
[0:58:19] <HoboFlea> Don't forget your DT
[0:58:21] <%Axellogic> you missed a chest but I dont remember if its anything important
[0:58:26] <%Axellogic> prolly not
[0:58:35] <Who_lio42> he's doing good. maybe some clarification on stuff but that's normal
[0:58:41] <%king_wragles> @ssjklyco Not as good as Reggie's
[0:58:44] <Sonny_Firestorm> @PatStaresAt You are doing alright for a self-taught, yes. But for endgame and DLC "alright" won't be enough.
[0:58:49] <TehMud> Unless its a lock of hair the chest probly doesn't matter
[0:58:52] <penitentpendant> Mission Completu
[0:58:55] <%Hamborgini> you got "mission macguffin"
[0:58:57] <Zombrocom> That was the boss yeah
[0:59:02] <sirrice77> key item
[0:59:03] <%Axellogic> Thats a key item
[0:59:03] <artoflec> man just let pat play and learn LUL
[0:59:04] <@GeneralSCPatton> And that should upgrade the blacksmith
[0:59:06] <Zombrocom> Magatamas are accessories
[0:59:07] <SaltyAzteca> theyre very fast
[0:59:09] <%abrupt_abe> Short side missions best side missions
[0:59:10] <TehMud> Key Item
[0:59:11] <Make_me_mad> Key item for the blacksmith
[0:59:13] <Sonny_Firestorm> No, it's just a furnace booster for Smith Girl.
[0:59:14] <TehMud> For Blacksmith
[0:59:16] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt protip, dude. Once you get enough of them, if you pop 4 spirit stones you refill your amrita gauge and can use your yokai form again without having to beat on shit to recharge it.
[0:59:16] <+Zinri_Luck> its quest item
[0:59:16] <+HuoShengdi> yeah most side missions are a quick thing like this
[0:59:17] <DragonOfWarZro> Quest item
[0:59:18] <+Local16> @PatStaresAt key item for the smith
[0:59:18] <%Axellogic> YOu unlock more stuff in the forge at the blacksmith
[0:59:21] <Zombrocom> Oh yeah, that one is the key item
[0:59:21] <thepardack> mission item
[0:59:22] <srv4254> give to mata dozo blacksmith
[0:59:23] <RubberFistFight> there is a 30s cooldown between shifts though.
[0:59:23] <%Hamborgini> just a key item for blacksmith
[0:59:25] <SaltyAzteca> maf
[0:59:29] <TehMud> Regular Magatama's are accessories. This one's for blacksmith
[0:59:34] <Sonny_Firestorm> @PatStaresAt Side Missions are just Hide doin' side hustle.
[0:59:38] <artoflec> nice priest pants nerd
[0:59:44] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> twinsies
[0:59:52] <%AncelDeLambert> nice pajamas, dork
[0:59:58] <+Inferno_Icon> blacksmith inventory expanding item
[1:00:05] <thepardack> haha this guy is fighting in his jammies
[1:00:05] <Mister_McDerp> wearing pajama pants LUL
[1:00:12] <artoflec> yeah itd be cool if there was like a "keep appearance" option that you can just tick
[1:00:13] <Ferakin> Refashion is super cheap though
[1:00:19] <artoflec> since you always get new gear
[1:00:22] <Ferakin> Not even a dent
[1:00:27] <%AncelDeLambert> ROLLIN ROLLIN ROLLIN
[1:00:33] <+Das_Prints> Ippon-Datara get.
[1:00:40] <Profmcstevie> Wheel Copy Ability ,neat
[1:00:43] <DragonOfWarZro> Just play as William
[1:00:45] <SpookyMooks> !uptime
[1:00:45] <@Moobot> @SpookyMooks I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 56s.
[1:00:45] <%Puhff> DANCE
[1:00:46] <srv4254> YEYEYE
[1:00:46] <youngking_kush> Kodama Bowl is a must have
[1:00:49] <Sonny_Firestorm> Ippon is the Brute (red) cheese.
[1:00:51] <%Axellogic> You might want to spec into heavy armor so you dont get staggered as much and take less damage. It complements stuff like odachi
[1:01:04] <%Hamborgini> find ya boys
[1:01:05] <artoflec> comfy forest rbeeCozy
[1:01:14] <srv4254> rescue mission
[1:01:15] <%TerpanderLux> oh no
[1:01:16] <Zombrocom> Toughness, yes
[1:01:21] <RubberFistFight> Not exactly.
[1:01:23] <+Zinri_Luck> YES
[1:01:23] <%TerpanderLux> LOL
[1:01:24] <%Axellogic> Defense isnt weight class Weight classes also have defense reduction
[1:01:24] <+Jack8274> Toughness is much more important
[1:01:24] <%MechArch> style points
[1:01:25] <efratzy> toughness
[1:01:26] <+alphonseisbest> yes the DICK stat
[1:01:26] <+tempestzephyr> yeah fasion
[1:01:27] <+bravofifeniner> Yeah, Toughness
[1:01:28] <RubberFistFight> See "toughness"?
[1:01:28] <%Agami23> theres a stat that matters more than defense
[1:01:29] <KatabolicRage> the little notches next to the helmet icon is the armors "weight"
[1:01:30] <youngking_kush> Toughness = Poise
[1:01:31] <%JoshManVGH> It's called mega defense
[1:01:32] <%Puhff> yeah it's called ligma
[1:01:33] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> the little weight on the side of defense
[1:01:33] <efratzy> its poise i think
[1:01:35] <Zombrocom> Toughness's break point is 200
[1:01:38] <%Hamborgini> toughness more less is just poise
[1:01:42] <Profmcstevie> Poise~
[1:01:44] <+Jack8274> It's Dark Souls 1 style poise, broken af
[1:01:44] <%Axellogic> Vs. Physical stat is also a direct damage percantage reduction
[1:01:46] <RubberFistFight> toughness makes you less likely to get staggered, defense just gives you an all-round damage reduction
[1:01:49] <+alphonseisbest> whats Toughness do chat?
[1:01:50] <+bravofifeniner> You want to be as fast as you can with as much toughness as you can get.
[1:01:50] <ElSuperNova> The three weight symbols
[1:01:53] <@GeneralSCPatton> Toughness is basically poise. You want to see the associated letter grade for it on your stats.
[1:01:58] <+Jack8274> At 200 toughness, you literally attack through basic mobs
[1:01:59] <%Axellogic> You need to pump stamina a bit
[1:02:00] <Zombrocom> Toughness is poise
[1:02:02] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt having green agility is better than having high defense/toughness.
[1:02:05] <%JoshManVGH> What does "Toughness breakpoint" mean? Softcap?
[1:02:05] <HoboFlea> Don't need poise if you don't get hit
[1:02:07] <Sonny_Firestorm> Toughness is a counter-stat for Equip Weight.
[1:02:15] <%Broand> Big ol poofy trousers
[1:02:15] <%TerpanderLux> good
[1:02:15] <shiny_prinny> if you can't get it now and stay lighter it's not a big deal
[1:02:16] <youngking_kush> @alphonseisbest Toughness is Poise, which means you its harder to stagger you
[1:02:17] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> perfect
[1:02:20] <+alphonseisbest> heh nice
[1:02:23] <Zombrocom> below 70% weight at 200 or more toughness is the key stats you want to hit
[1:02:24] <%TerpanderLux> you can glamour if you want
[1:02:26] <%Blank9> toughness is poise + guard stability in one
[1:02:29] <%valriot> Make you block like a champ too
[1:02:32] <+Jack8274> @JoshManVGH There is an S rank but only attainable in NG+ DLC sets
[1:02:32] <%JoshManVGH> Six-Nice Percent
[1:02:36] <%Axellogic> Toughness increase your stagger resist and lessens how much ki you lose when blocking
[1:02:41] <DragonOfWarZro> Tu
[1:02:43] <RubberFistFight> "I FORT DERE'D BE SPIRRIT STOHNS HEAH"
[1:02:45] <+shry7> ;ettah

[1:02:57] <Sonny_Firestorm> not enough Insight to understand him

[1:03:04] <President_valentine> This guy sounds lame in English
[1:03:05] <%MidnightPacif1c> bitchin sword orb man
[1:03:13] <+Zinri_Luck> the more green bois u find, ull be able to understand them more
[1:03:13] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[1:03:14] <susukouhai> Patches?!!
[1:03:19] <%templar010> "Perfectly Understandable have a nice day"
[1:03:24] <RubberFistFight> @President_valentine they all do.
[1:03:42] <Sonny_Firestorm> Dark Realm, ah yes this is gonna be delicious.
[1:03:47] <%templar010> Big evil
[1:03:50] <%Valdorick> They're speaking in English, they're speaking British Kappa
[1:03:51] <xerotwo> ALMOST CHRISTMAS MEANS IT'S NOT CHRISTMAS! doodBait
[1:03:51] <President_valentine> Yeah but he sounds extra lame
[1:03:54] <youngking_kush> Dark Realms are a big thing in this game, one in almost every level
[1:03:59] <RubberFistFight> OH SHIT IT'S THIS ONE
[1:04:00] <RubberFistFight> ahahahaha
[1:04:04] <RubberFistFight> this took me fucken ages
[1:04:15] <waltzqueen> @xerotwo sir, it's christmas in Japanifornia
[1:04:36] <DragonOfWarZro> Its not even endearing like in xenoblade chronicles 2
[1:04:48] <+polothegreatest> Japanamerica
[1:04:57] <%Blank9> I think it's endearing for being full british on japanese characters
[1:05:05] <RubberFistFight> poke her in the tiddies
[1:05:10] <RubberFistFight> make em jiggle
[1:05:11] <President_valentine> Snake Lady
[1:05:12] <%Axellogic> Sneks dont glow when they hide like other enemies
[1:05:27] <%Agami23> feral looks like it has the worst counter in the game
[1:05:33] <+Jack8274> In co-op I've seen dozens of people die grabbing that item
[1:05:33] <Sonny_Firestorm> Hiding enemies are hidden.
[1:05:49] <Ferakin> If the yokai burst ki breaks an enemy, you can immediately do the special stab move on them to do a full counter attack in yokai form
[1:05:49] <President_valentine> Feral is good its just takes some learning
[1:05:49] <RubberFistFight> @Sonny_Firestorm "people die when they are killed"
[1:05:52] <youngking_kush> @agami23 Ita cuz it a free dodge too
[1:06:00] <foxenco> it limited to a cube
[1:06:08] <%Agami23> that makes sense
[1:06:10] <%Blank9> phantom's the only one that feels kinda bad
[1:06:12] <Sonny_Firestorm> @Sonny_Firestorm In Nioh, only sometimes. KEKW
[1:06:12] <DragonOfWarZro> They're all good and have varying match ups
[1:06:28] <slackerunchained> Yay! Nioh!
[1:06:33] <+Jack8274> And it goes away once every demon is dead
[1:06:34] <HoboFlea> @Agami23 it's probably the best actually. Super fast, i-frames, and moves you
[1:06:36] <President_valentine> Phantom is the easiest since its just a parry
[1:06:51] <Sonny_Firestorm> Reason you're given 2 slots is cause each parry has it's uses.
[1:06:59] <slackerunchained> Just finished watching Woolie's stream. Thought I'd head over here.
[1:07:08] <Zombrocom> Phantom has the highest reward since it's recovery is so quick
[1:07:12] <Sonny_Firestorm> Brute can interrupt things that aren't attacks.
[1:07:15] <RubberFistFight> she;'s the realm generator
[1:07:17] <RubberFistFight> notice the flowers
[1:07:32] <Sonny_Firestorm> Red Flower particles = Boss
[1:07:33] <President_valentine> aim for the horn
[1:07:33] <+alphonseisbest> @slackerunchained same, what a good night of streams
[1:07:40] <youngking_kush> I'm a Brute Parry guy all day personally
[1:07:45] <+Zinri_Luck> SNAKE HIM
[1:07:49] <+Jack8274> I hate that counter personally
[1:07:50] <fat_burtreynolds> Good ol demon musket
[1:07:51] <President_valentine> Gotta dodge into them
[1:07:53] <%Axellogic> Feral requires alot more training and timing
[1:07:55] <KatabolicRage> I find it often easier to use the dodge counter straight into the enemy rather than side to sidde
[1:08:02] <Profmcstevie> It's less a dodge more a headbutt
[1:08:11] <slackerunchained> @alphonseisbest Truly, we are blessed with Holidays fortune. :)
[1:08:18] <%SirGO0SE> a good souls night for us frienders
[1:08:21] <didgereedoodah> feral has the strictest timing
[1:08:26] <foxenco> you gota think like you're lariating them
[1:08:26] <%cade_calrayn> yeah I always use it to dodge into the attack, it works best that way
[1:08:28] <youngking_kush> Yessir
[1:08:32] <Pablov921> My personal favorite is the phantom parry
[1:08:34] <%Blank9> kinda like witch time dodging into an attack
[1:08:39] <fat_burtreynolds> Headslott
[1:08:45] <youngking_kush> Reggie beating Dark Souls was hype
[1:08:47] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> phantom parry is the best
[1:08:49] <%Axellogic> Soul Cores drop more often in dark realms
[1:08:52] <Sonny_Firestorm> Feral is hard to land but more often than not you'll be safe if you whiff. (compared to Phantom)
[1:08:52] <bippityjones> So how much better is 2 than 1?
[1:08:55] <youngking_kush> We watched the Plague video
[1:09:03] <%SirGO0SE> p sure reggie cried
[1:09:05] <President_valentine> Way better
[1:09:05] <%Axellogic> @bippityjones much
[1:09:12] <sirrice77> @bippityjones much better
[1:09:14] <bippityjones> :o
[1:09:20] <+ThisRebelLion> Oni Counter strong. Oni counter da bes.
[1:09:24] <%Hamborgini> 2 is so much better that this isn't even a mind goblins steam anymore
[1:09:24] <DragonOfWarZro> 24% more
[1:09:28] <foxenco> @bippityjones progression is much more straight forward
[1:09:35] <youngking_kush> @bippityjones Its one of those sequels where they clearly heard all the complaints about the first one
[1:09:40] <slackerunchained> It's been a while since I played Nioh 2, personally. tell me, what exactly dictates whether or not you are able to comprehend what the enemies sometimes say in the Demon language when they occasionally chatter?
[1:09:54] <%SirGO0SE> yeah i noticed the "mind goblins" part has been removed from the title LUL @PatStaresAt
[1:09:58] <%abrupt_abe> Try snaking them
[1:09:58] <+Jack8274> Nice counter
[1:10:00] <Sonny_Firestorm> @slackerunchained Astral Knowledge
[1:10:00] <foxenco> @slackerunchained how many tims have you heard them
[1:10:03] <bippityjones> Snoobs

[1:10:23] <%cade_calrayn> enter the snussy
[1:10:27] <%SirGO0SE> wtf that snake has huge tittos
[1:10:32] <bippityjones> It's not as good as Whussy
[1:10:34] <%SirGO0SE> i gotta get me this game
[1:10:35] <RubberFistFight> @slackerunchained i believe it's related to how many of their soul cores you've collected.
[1:10:35] <%Axellogic> Shes the realm boss so she stronger
[1:10:37] <%OrangeMDT> Why have you shown me this game, Pat. Now I have to buy it
[1:10:42] <Zombrocom> Snake beats snake
[1:10:42] <%Visorak6> superior sneg
[1:10:43] <+possumwalsh1221> Booba snek strong
[1:10:44] <%Hamborgini> booba core
[1:10:44] <+Zinri_Luck> always use snake, its a problem solver
[1:10:47] <+pectusumbra> cool!
[1:10:48] <RubberFistFight> god they have such hot "ara ara" energy
[1:10:49] <+Jack8274> Haven't you heard of milking snakes chat?
[1:10:49] <+tempestzephyr> snek on snek
[1:11:00] <sirrice77> snek counters snek of course!
[1:11:02] <Pablov921> the yatsu-no-kami core is so cool
[1:11:05] <+gfb537> Very nice recovery, @PatStaresAt
[1:11:07] <youngking_kush> I'm glad people are fucking with this cuz Nioh 2 is GREAT and underrated
[1:11:08] <+pectusumbra> I'm assuming snek is the para-gaze?
[1:11:08] <%superc37> booby snek
[1:11:10] <Mister_McDerp> snek waifu for laifu
[1:11:11] <penitentpendant> @OrangeMDT If you own steam, it's on sale right now for extra good timing
[1:11:12] <Spagheddies> @RubberFistFight Astral Knowledge, which is tied to Soul Cores, but not exclusively that.
[1:11:22] <RubberFistFight> 999 famil with some really strong affixes
[1:11:24] <+zanz_san> sword
[1:11:24] <slackerunchained> Sadly, much like the XCOM vipers, they're actually venom sacs...
[1:11:24] <%SirGO0SE> pokemon :)
[1:11:25] <RubberFistFight> that's really good
[1:11:26] <%greasypete00> that sword looks fucking cool whatd i miss
[1:11:30] <bippityjones> Tony Marone is my pal from 23rd st over in Brooklyn
[1:11:30] <+HuoShengdi> tokagemaru is a yokai katana
[1:11:31] <%Hamborgini> press L2 to see lore
[1:11:31] <fat_burtreynolds> Straight up Demon Martial Arts? I’m down
[1:11:32] <Sonny_Firestorm> Tokagemaru is a yokai sword
[1:11:33] <DragonOfWarZro> Read the lore
[1:11:35] <Zombrocom> Tokagemaru is a pretty good kay-tana
[1:11:35] <+zanz_san> demon sword
[1:11:37] <RubberFistFight> it's only a katana tho
[1:11:38] <%Broand> It dropped from an ippon datara iirc
[1:11:39] <RubberFistFight> not an odachi
[1:11:40] <+Zinri_Luck> who cares, its not fists
[1:11:43] <Spagheddies> Tokagemaru is a really solid Sentient Odachi.
[1:11:47] <%hax_metatron> It’s my main sword
[1:11:48] <youngking_kush> Tokagemaru is my sword
[1:11:54] <%TerpanderLux> thats kinda cool
[1:12:00] <artoflec> btw pat if you come across whetstones you can use them to max out familiarity right away elaYEP
[1:12:00] <foxenco> SAVE THAT ONE, it lets you inherit the familiarity damage
[1:12:01] <Sonny_Firestorm> Most Yokai Weapons are fucking yokais.
[1:12:07] <youngking_kush> @hax_metatron Bros! lol
[1:12:08] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt your current one is too, that's why it spoke to you before and why you've got a bar under the icon on the right
[1:12:10] <slackerunchained> Yokai are not bound by our sill, biological existences...
[1:12:11] <+hush_wolf> pretty metal
[1:12:31] <Spagheddies> Oh yeah, those are the Tsuchigumo Claws.
[1:12:34] <%hax_metatron> @youngking_kush Amazing and varied skills with that one
[1:12:35] <+hush_wolf> damn berserker barrage
[1:12:38] <Sonny_Firestorm> @slackerunchained no but they have their idiosyncrasies
[1:12:58] <%Axellogic> Yeah you just dont get the cool grapples
[1:13:04] <%Axellogic> other side
[1:13:05] <RubberFistFight> yokai are so, so much cooler and more intricate than the "generic monsters" they usually get portrayed as
[1:13:09] <%Blank9> yep, it's like getting a free kick as a combo finisher
[1:13:09] <%Axellogic> its not on roof
[1:13:14] <%Visorak6> Its around back
[1:13:17] <%OthoZen> psaUp
[1:13:18] <Sonny_Firestorm> Fist is basically a less Tonfa but full of flashy moves and less straight-forward.
[1:13:20] <RubberFistFight> this game is one of the few i've played featuring them that actually gets em more-or-less right
[1:13:23] <+Zinri_Luck> behind
[1:13:48] <Spagheddies> This game's enemy design is FUCKING RAD
[1:13:55] <artoflec> is a kodama a yokai artofl1Hm
[1:14:04] <Spagheddies> Let me not mince words.
[1:14:06] <RubberFistFight> @Spagheddies it really is.
[1:14:10] <ytwitchmeng> If Pat was a real life Yokai slayer..what would your catchphrase be?
[1:14:11] <+hush_wolf> Leon Kennedy problems
[1:14:11] <Sonny_Firestorm> No, kodama are not yokai.
[1:14:17] <Sonny_Firestorm> THey are tree spirits.
[1:14:22] <%TerpanderLux> Scampus
[1:14:29] <RubberFistFight> @artoflec yes, they are
[1:14:30] <penitentpendant> Six Stacks of CAT
[1:14:31] <artoflec> is a SCAMPUS a yokai artofl1Hm isnt their lore kinda sad actually
[1:14:31] <Spagheddies> @artoflec Not technically, but maybe sometimes, if you go to the right places.
[1:14:32] <slackerunchained> ELMOBALL
[1:14:33] <fat_burtreynolds> Fuggin spin to win
[1:14:34] <%cade_calrayn> round kitteh
[1:14:39] <Sonny_Firestorm> All Hail Our Lord and Savior, the Scampuss
[1:14:41] <youngking_kush> @artoflec Yes. There Aratama, good Yokai. And Magatama, bad Yokai
[1:14:52] <%Axellogic> Door in the house on the left
[1:14:52] <+possumwalsh1221> I love Catball
[1:14:54] <Sonny_Firestorm> Pat do emotes
[1:14:55] <fat_burtreynolds> Best roll
[1:14:55] <artoflec> ohh thats what those words mean, ive seen them before
[1:15:01] <youngking_kush> So like Kodama, Mujina are Aratama
[1:15:07] <RubberFistFight> @youngking_kush lol no a magatama is a little comma-shaped pendant. You're thinking of NIGItama
[1:15:08] <%TerpanderLux> sick flips
[1:15:11] <RubberFistFight> so aratama and nigitama
[1:15:11] <%cade_calrayn> What would you do if Elmo started rolling around like Scampus, Pat?
[1:15:13] <+zanz_san> Do you like brute or feral counter better?
[1:15:14] <artoflec> that cat is amazing
[1:15:18] <slackerunchained> @youngking_kush Sorta like Seelie/Unseelie.
[1:15:19] <didgereedoodah> aratama are the bad ones I'm pretty sure
[1:15:19] <%OthoZen> psaElmo
[1:15:20] <SpookyMooks> pat finds affinity with other orb like creatures it seems
[1:15:21] <Zombrocom> He do a flip
[1:15:24] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> Rad
[1:15:25] <youngking_kush> @rubberfistfight You're right thanks
[1:15:26] <+hush_wolf> i'd shit
[1:15:29] <bippityjones> Code-Mama? How do you know my nickname for my gf in Platform Development?
[1:15:30] <penitentpendant> "Stop showing off Elmo."
[1:15:31] <youngking_kush> Its Nigitama
[1:15:36] <%Saadi90> I want one
[1:15:37] <RubberFistFight> @didgereedoodah they are. nigitama are the friendly/benevolent ones
[1:15:38] <DragonOfWarZro> Yokai are gods that aren't worshipped
[1:15:42] <%Axellogic> You have to drop items to complete the objective anyway
[1:15:43] <slackerunchained> If it happens: Stream it, pat.
[1:15:47] <%TerpanderLux> owned
[1:15:47] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> LUL
[1:15:52] <@GeneralSCPatton> Chance of a Kodama core there
[1:15:52] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> good hustle
[1:15:54] <Sonny_Firestorm> Rerolls the soulcore
[1:15:54] <spongeofmystery> DENIED
[1:15:57] <President_valentine> unlucky
[1:15:57] <+Zinri_Luck> u can drop equipment
[1:15:58] <shiny_prinny> only works with purified soul cores
[1:16:00] <%CatastropheCorvid> Better stats usually
[1:16:02] <Qsmash_> just like in SMT
[1:16:03] <+critikal_bit> Oh damn, I didn't know you could give them soul cores!
[1:16:04] <Sonny_Firestorm> sometimes gives you a Kodama Soul Core
[1:16:05] <%Axellogic> They dont like unpurified cores
[1:16:05] <Spagheddies> Yeah, it rerolled the stats.
[1:16:09] <%epide> what would you pay for a pug skin for him
[1:16:11] <fat_burtreynolds> You might have flapjack and the Rich Lady under your spell but I *sees flip* Woooooooahahahoooooo
[1:16:14] <%IamGrapes> i always thought those things want those flowers they hold
[1:16:14] <%CatastropheCorvid> If you drop a core and they give it back, t's usually better stats
[1:16:17] <GhoulishCripple> Kodama Soul Core is Elixir generating
[1:16:22] <Spagheddies> Phantom Counter is my jam.
[1:16:29] <%Blank9> brute all the way
[1:16:33] <IntrepidEye> There was something about dropping two items but I can't remember the details
[1:16:34] <%Axellogic> well you cleared a yokai realm so feel free to drop back at shrine they wont respawn
[1:16:34] <artoflec> yeah the lore of the Scampus is they were young children and animals who died an untimely death elaPain
[1:16:35] <+Zinri_Luck> but its a dodge that doesnt use stamina
[1:16:38] <ytwitchmeng> haha flapjack.
[1:16:38] <+HuoShengdi> yeah I like phantom counter
[1:16:41] <%Blank9> best feeling yokai form too
[1:16:43] <+tempestzephyr> told you your soul core aint good around these part
[1:16:46] <ytwitchmeng> Who is Captain KaNuckles
[1:16:48] <President_valentine> Kodama core also buff their blessings
[1:16:50] <defaultname3887> you should try the royal guard one
[1:16:51] <Sonny_Firestorm> @GhoulishCripple Kodama in Dark Realm is damage, actually.
[1:16:57] <penitentpendant> Good throw
[1:17:08] <slackerunchained> @artoflec That's a horrifying backstory for such an adorable critter. :)
[1:17:09] <%TerpanderLux> that move is so cool
[1:17:17] <Sonny_Firestorm> Kodama Core in dark realm summons a Sudama instead, who uses Thundaga.
[1:17:24] <oda_flobunaga> Brute is definitely great but it has limitations, namely any burst attack that is not directly in front of you
[1:17:25] <GhoulishCripple> @sonny_firestorm yeah it summons a Sudama. but in normal realm if the nut hits and you have less than 8 elixirs it makes one
[1:17:26] <RubberFistFight> @slackerunchained a lot of the yokai have SUPER tragic backstories
[1:17:29] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> yes
[1:17:30] <+Zinri_Luck> yes
[1:17:34] <artoflec> and apparently people bully the scampuss because it can only turn spiky, but those people tend to "reap what they sow" because of it.
[1:17:34] <shiny_prinny> eventually yeah
[1:17:43] <RubberFistFight> but a lot of them are literally "idk the paper umbrella got left outside for too long and turned into a monster or something"
[1:17:56] <%Blank9> yeah this side mission is find all kodama
[1:17:56] <President_valentine> Considering most enemies are "thing died when it was super angry" Scampuss ain't too bad
[1:18:05] <ytwitchmeng> Snek
[1:18:11] <Sonny_Firestorm> @artoflec More like they act reckless and get fucked for it.
[1:18:15] <youngking_kush> @rubberfistfight The fucking Umbrellas are the worst lol
[1:18:26] <%cade_calrayn> sniddy snek with sus snussy
[1:18:26] <fat_burtreynolds> 760 sucks
[1:18:28] <slackerunchained> @RubberFistFight Was the Moldy Potato Salad that Paige ate that one time actually a Yokai?
[1:18:30] <RubberFistFight> @youngking_kush god i hate em so fucking much
[1:18:33] <artoflec> i need a toy for my irl scampuss hes going nuts
[1:18:33] <Profmcstevie> There are just straight yokai of "it existed for too long and became alive", some of them are whack as hell LUL
[1:18:35] <%cade_calrayn> oh FUCK THE UMBRELLAS
[1:18:40] <Mister_McDerp> snek cloaca
[1:18:40] <RubberFistFight> @slackerunchained fucken probably lol
[1:18:49] <Sonny_Firestorm> Oh btw just a PSA: snek woman are called "Nure Onna" which literaly translates to "wet woman" Kappa
[1:18:54] <+tempestzephyr> women and their hair attacks
[1:18:54] <%couch_potato_Ed_Boy> @PatStaresAt Electric damage is really good against the Snake woman
[1:18:59] <oda_flobunaga> Umbrellas are bad, but, Konaki-Jiji can fuck righ off
[1:19:01] <foxenco> Umbrellas are easy, just stagger them lmao
[1:19:02] <srv4254> some tragic yokai but also ones that us their balls as a hat
[1:19:05] <RubberFistFight> @Sonny_Firestorm they're effectively Sirens
[1:19:10] <youngking_kush> Give him an item
[1:19:10] <%Axellogic> You have to drop for them to finish objective
[1:19:20] <%Axellogic> Drop a purified core instead
[1:19:23] <%TerpanderLux> :)
[1:19:28] <artoflec> sudama pls FeelsWeirdMan
[1:19:28] <%king_wragles> Stop giving it crap maybe?
[1:19:28] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> It needs to be purified
[1:19:28] <fat_burtreynolds> Pumba rump
[1:19:32] <fat_burtreynolds> Warm
[1:19:33] <+pectusumbra> give them ones that are purified
[1:19:33] <Sonny_Firestorm> No, it's a core reroll mechanic.
[1:19:34] <youngking_kush> He does it for items too
[1:19:35] <%Hamborgini> white text
[1:19:37] <fat_burtreynolds> Soft
[1:19:37] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> the white ones
[1:19:40] <%Broand> Their name is white
[1:19:41] <fat_burtreynolds> Pickle Pee
[1:19:41] <Mr_Rakjo> no ??
[1:19:42] <%Axellogic> The unpurified ones are orange
[1:19:44] <+pectusumbra> the ones you can read
[1:19:44] <+zanz_san> white text
[1:19:48] <+HuoShengdi> also the cloud icon
[1:19:51] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt they reroll the passives on the cores everytime you do tha
[1:19:52] <foxenco> level isnt ????
[1:19:53] <oda_flobunaga> t
[1:19:54] <sirrice77> I think they just reroll cores don't they?
[1:19:56] <@GeneralSCPatton> Nah, just a reroll with a chance to get a Kodama core instead
[1:19:58] <RubberFistFight> @srv4254 the Nurikabe is hilarious. It's a yokai that got invented by EMBARRASSED TRAVELERS because they didn't want to admit they got lost and misplaced some of their shit.
[1:20:01] <Sonny_Firestorm> also Level ???
[1:20:02] <Ferakin> If you're lucky enough, they'll give a Kodama core back
[1:20:16] <artoflec> @RubberFistFight lol thats pretty good
[1:20:17] <+Zinri_Luck> u can drop weapons, and reroll them into other weapons
[1:20:18] <%Axellogic> house to th eleft
[1:20:20] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> other house
[1:20:21] <ytwitchmeng> Would Dark Souls man survive Nioh World?
[1:20:25] <%Axellogic> theres a back door
[1:20:26] <Bajumeru> go to where you found scampus
[1:20:35] <Sonny_Firestorm> @srv4254 It's funny in-game too cause if you can get to their backs you can insta-kill them LUL
[1:20:43] <longtom21> sure Kappa
[1:20:49] <President_valentine> Dark Souls man seems too slow for this world
[1:20:50] <Make_me_mad> @ytwitchmeng Not unless he can block 100 percent of damage with his sword he can't.
[1:21:00] <artoflec> wow
[1:21:01] <%TerpanderLux> :)
[1:21:02] <artoflec> Clap
[1:21:02] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> HELL YEAH
[1:21:03] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> NEAT
[1:21:05] <@PrefectusCorgi> Whoop
[1:21:06] <GhoulishCripple> big unluck
[1:21:07] <%king_wragles> Cool! Spiritstone ya!
[1:21:09] <youngking_kush> Its RNG lol
[1:21:10] <%couch_potato_Ed_Boy> NICE
[1:21:10] <@GeneralSCPatton> That's some crap RNG
[1:21:11] <%Axellogic> They arent garunteed to drop the kodama core
[1:21:11] <+HuoShengdi> RIPPED OFF
[1:21:11] <RubberFistFight> Spirit stones are super useful
[1:21:11] <%king_wragles> That's good right?
[1:21:12] <IntrepidEye> got scammed
[1:21:14] <shiny_prinny> it's just a chance
[1:21:15] <slackerunchained> Medieval Japan: Where Naruto-Running isn't just a good idea, IT'S THE LAW!
[1:21:16] <President_valentine> You're super unlucky lol
[1:21:17] <+Zinri_Luck> ive been saying equipment
[1:21:17] <Mister_McDerp> good trade
[1:21:17] <RubberFistFight> 4 of them will refil your shift guage
[1:21:18] <DragonOfWarZro> If pat was a yokai he'd definitely be a Tesso
[1:21:23] <+zanz_san> yyyyyeeeeaahhh
[1:21:23] <ferbeholds> sorry pat but sudamas dont reroll soul cores only special ones in ng+
[1:21:28] <%king_wragles> Ya, super good! Big spirit stone time!
[1:21:28] <Make_me_mad> Just give the sudama cool equipment and they'll give you other cool equipment.
[1:21:30] <Sonny_Firestorm> It's RNG, I usually just throw them sake cause they usually like it.
[1:21:31] <artoflec> is that kodama literally lost right in front of the shrine
[1:21:32] <%king_wragles> Ye ye ye
[1:21:35] <RubberFistFight> @DragonOfWarZro those things fucking gross me out
[1:21:38] <DXLelouch24> Rng is rng Pat
[1:21:40] <RubberFistFight> with their shit-encrusted tails
[1:21:55] <%Axellogic> @ferbeholds giving them a soul core increases odds of getting a kodama core
[1:21:56] <Sonny_Firestorm> @artoflec the kodama in front of the shrine is the one that ISN'T lost.
[1:21:56] <RubberFistFight> @artoflec no he's the questgiver
[1:22:01] <Sonny_Firestorm> he's the quest giver
[1:22:03] <Spagheddies> No, Pat wouldn't be a Tesso. He'd be a [DLC spoilers]
[1:22:13] <%TerpanderLux> :)
[1:22:15] <%notsoy> 78 elixirs jesus christ
[1:22:17] <Make_me_mad> There is a DLC Yokai that is just a Pat.
[1:22:24] <RubberFistFight> Pat would be a wheelmonk. Powered by anger, orbular, and rolls everywhere.
[1:22:28] <longtom21> on samurai, just lv dex is already OP
[1:22:33] <srv4254> which yokai steals your soul orb out of your ass?
[1:22:33] <youngking_kush> @spagheddies I know EXACTLY which enemy you mean lmfao
[1:22:34] <Sonny_Firestorm> @Spagheddies oh yeah, I know exactly which Yokai yall are talking about.
[1:22:35] <DXLelouch24> Pat check out the Beyond Infinity fist skill
[1:22:36] <Profmcstevie> No thought just balance
[1:22:42] <+Zinri_Luck> all stats are important
[1:22:42] <%Axellogic> Also this game is very friendly to respeccing to minmax your stats to your build
[1:22:43] <RubberFistFight> @srv4254 Kappa
[1:22:44] <Sonny_Firestorm> Yup, totally would be Pat.
[1:22:45] <youngking_kush> Big Pat energy lol
[1:22:45] <slackerunchained> Yeah. Pat would absolutely be a WheelMonk
[1:22:46] <@GeneralSCPatton> I think the only soft cap is equip load
[1:22:46] <RubberFistFight> shit
[1:22:48] <KatabolicRage> that's Kappa's srv
[1:22:49] <President_valentine> @srv4254 kappas
[1:22:56] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> @srv4254 kappas
[1:22:56] <+Zinri_Luck> NICE
[1:22:56] <$Jaxnos> nice
[1:22:57] <%TerpanderLux> good
[1:22:58] <RubberFistFight> @srv4254 the kappa does that
[1:22:59] <+tempestzephyr> wow
[1:23:06] <%Axellogic> Snek is bad with walls
[1:23:07] <RubberFistFight> the headless in sekiro are based loosely on kappa
[1:23:07] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> Its actually a move on the game
[1:23:18] <+hush_wolf> poor monke
[1:23:18] <+Zinri_Luck> JUST DO IT AGAIN
[1:23:32] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> You think Kung Fu Panda is in this game as a secret boss?
[1:23:36] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt you can identify them by the red spider lilies that sprout around them. The realm generator ALWAYS has those.
[1:23:39] <Sonny_Firestorm> Look at their feet to tell if they're the one.
[1:23:40] <$Jaxnos> ayy, footsies time
[1:23:41] <+Nomenanza> aw god ippon dataras can be so annoying sometimes
[1:23:42] <%Axellogic> You can tell which one it is by looking at the minimap of if they have spiderlilies at their feet
[1:23:42] <+HuoShengdi> You can tell which yokai is making the dark realm by the spider lilies blooming around their feet
[1:23:45] <longtom21> the one with music is main
[1:23:47] <Sonny_Firestorm> Particle effects give it away.
[1:23:49] <slackerunchained> Paige would become a Gashadokuro... The Biggest Skeleton of All...
[1:24:01] <%SirGO0SE> that form is cool as hell wow
[1:24:07] <DragonOfWarZro> Pat is Nuppeppo
[1:24:09] <GhoulishCripple> if you have enemy sensors the generator yokai is marked in blue on the minima9
[1:24:19] <+Iggysteve> rip
[1:24:21] <Astrophizz> big ouch
[1:24:21] <penitentpendant> Stinger
[1:24:22] <%Visorak6> SKEWERED
[1:24:22] <longtom21> different timing on different counter burst
[1:24:23] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> PSYCHO CRUSHER
[1:24:25] <%TerpanderLux> impaled jermaPluto
[1:24:26] <+tempestzephyr> f
[1:24:27] <$Jaxnos> s t i n g e r
[1:24:28] <@Lion_kun> I prefer brute
[1:24:30] <fat_burtreynolds> Hokuto no Ken ass demon
[1:24:38] <youngking_kush> Nope, Stinger
[1:24:39] <@Lion_kun> no need to react
[1:24:41] <%Axellogic> @GhoulishCripple Its marked blue on minimap either way
[1:24:43] <GhoulishCripple> auto-grave is amazing
[1:24:44] <fat_burtreynolds> Still badass
[1:24:47] <+Nomenanza> oh nice souls auto recovered
[1:24:48] <kinkade_77> what is it with souls like games and psycho crushers
[1:24:48] <@Lion_kun> just do it the moment you see red
[1:24:51] <yukichocomilk> I like the purple ones, where you tank the hit
[1:25:03] <%Axellogic> btw blue markers on your minimap are unopened chests
[1:25:07] <slackerunchained> Thanks Buddha! :)
[1:25:15] <kingra> So I'm guessing since Pat is not dying in this stream that he likes it a whole lot more than 1?
[1:25:24] <GhoulishCripple> @axellogic oh neat. tbh I almost always temper my accessories to have enemy sensor so I've never really not had it
[1:26:01] <+alphonseisbest> @kingra YUUUUUUUUUUUUUP
[1:26:15] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> tusks
[1:26:15] <slackerunchained> I went with the full Ninja Gaiden homage set in game #1, myself...
[1:26:21] <%Axellogic> Its tthe tusks you have to break
[1:26:29] <+Nomenanza> oh yeah the snake boss soul is so good
[1:26:38] <slackerunchained> Infinite shuriken were pretty dope, NGL.
[1:26:40] <ExpressNode> The Pogo demon
[1:26:56] <+Dova573> dont let him rolento you
[1:27:13] <youngking_kush> @patstaresat Theres a skill in Shiftling Tree that gives you Health back on Burst Counter. Top of the page if I'm not mistaken.
[1:27:15] <TigerCrownPorter> @Nomenanza iirc it was even better before they nerfed it or smth right?
[1:27:16] <Profmcstevie> Can any creature that loves to bounce TRULY be bad
[1:27:24] <californaya> nice-u
[1:27:37] <President_valentine> Pat if you immediately Grapple after counter you do the Yokai grapple instead
[1:27:41] <+antares_000> if you hit triangle when the yokai parry empty's their ki bar you get a special finish iirc
[1:27:44] <+HuoShengdi> yeah yatsu-no-kami ate a nerf at some point afaik
[1:27:50] <longtom21> the fact that they add 1-2 more moves to certain enemies on higher difficulty (NG+)
[1:27:53] <GhoulishCripple> Ippon Datara are just Blacksmith who traded humanity for more time on the clock.
[1:27:56] <+Nomenanza> @TigerCrownPorter I think its main power was that it fucking bounced all over the place in enclosed environments.
[1:28:01] <youngking_kush> Yes
[1:28:01] <GhoulishCripple> little girl blacksmith tamed one
[1:28:14] <%Axellogic> btw that special finese can be stacked to like 40-60 percent health
[1:28:15] <+Nomenanza> But yatsu kinda becomes obsolete after you get Kasha soul
[1:28:16] <GilliamYaeger> You have to equip green skills
[1:28:21] <+Dova573> I also like the medusa yokai summon
[1:28:21] <%SirGO0SE> @Profmcstevie Tigger is a cold MFer
[1:28:28] <Sonny_Firestorm> @longtom21 At first it's only for the bosses, but eventually even the regular enemies get modified.
[1:28:33] <%superc37> @patstaresat you can bookmark a skill btw by clicking on it with the right stick
[1:28:46] <Zombrocom> Elemental arcana are best on multi hitting moves
[1:28:47] <%Axellogic> elements are best on moves that hit many times
[1:28:48] <slackerunchained> Great, Now. I'm imagining Andre of Astora as an Ippon-Datura...
[1:29:11] <+hush_wolf> that menu murders my brain
[1:29:19] <+Nomenanza> oh that move is dope
[1:29:22] <+hush_wolf> too much
[1:29:23] <shiny_prinny> real falcon punch
[1:29:25] <%Hamborgini> elemental mods are great for multi-hitting skills
[1:29:25] <+tempestzephyr> fire punch
[1:29:27] <GhoulishCripple> @slackerunchained he would 100% become an Ippon Datara
[1:29:38] <%Axellogic> You can ignore the skill equips entirely
[1:29:39] <%Tragosavich> The skill menu is the scariest thing in this game imo
[1:29:40] <President_valentine> Elements are better used on multi hitting skills
[1:29:43] <Sonny_Firestorm> It's very situational and will probably not come back in Nioh 3.
[1:29:45] <longtom21> thats what keeps me moving to NG++ xD
[1:29:51] <Profmcstevie> It's a min maxers system
[1:29:56] <+Nomenanza> fists due to how fast you can hit shit become so stupid with corruption
[1:29:56] <youngking_kush> You gotta just spend like an hour setting your skills up one time then you dont have to do it again for awhile
[1:29:56] <KatabolicRage> familiarty tends to boost attack somewhat after using it for a bi
[1:30:00] <+bravofifeniner> Don't worry about them right now. They don't come in to play until New Game +
[1:30:03] <+alphonseisbest> WAIT what system/
[1:30:04] <+alphonseisbest> ?
[1:30:05] <+HuoShengdi> They're really only useful to dig into when you've got a specific build you want to min max in NG++ and beyond
[1:30:09] <youngking_kush> Till you get something cool
[1:30:10] <%Blank9> attack stat and element are the only thing to pay attention to
[1:30:18] <+hush_wolf> OCD kryptonite
[1:30:21] <+Local16> @PatStaresAt You can totally just ignore it I was fine without them on NG++
[1:30:25] <artoflec> i think if they brought it back, they'd roll it into an existing system - like attaching it to the soul core you use for example.
[1:30:33] <didgereedoodah> I didn't use them at all until NG+3
[1:30:36] <%Axellogic> The elemental ones can be helpful though since you dont have to put the element on your weapon if its just one specific skill you use for elemental accumulation
[1:30:39] <+Dova573> is that the monster weapon? cause the moment i got scythe variant of that I never went back
[1:30:42] <+Zinri_Luck> drop that rare sword
[1:30:43] <+HuoShengdi> even in Dream of the Nioh I've only got a few equipped
[1:30:43] <+Zinri_Luck> yeyeye
[1:30:45] <%TerpanderLux> :)
[1:30:50] <+hush_wolf> oh he liked it
[1:30:50] <+HuoShengdi> just for element stuff
[1:30:55] <%Axellogic> Tonfas are fun
[1:30:59] <%TerpanderLux> theyre trolling you
[1:31:03] <RubberFistFight> pat there's a chest around that corner you missed
[1:31:04] <@GeneralSCPatton> It does allow for some neat tactics. I've got paralysis on a retreating move, and bonus souls from my ground slam.
[1:31:06] <RubberFistFight> left from the sudama
[1:31:06] <yukichocomilk> they're so pointless
[1:31:07] <+Nomenanza> you can drop up to like 3 items for them iirc?
[1:31:11] <slackerunchained> Tonfa are super-defensive.
[1:31:12] <%Axellogic> You missed another chest pat they are blue on your minimap
[1:31:17] <%superc37> pat you play mmos
[1:31:22] <youngking_kush> @nomenanza The Big ones yeah
[1:31:24] <%AHomeschoolDropout> Poker is a legitimately fun card game
[1:31:26] <@GeneralSCPatton> Just drop the highest level purple you won't use.
[1:31:28] <%SirGO0SE> jermaGrin more gambling for me
[1:31:30] <TigerCrownPorter> @Nomenanza Believe thats only the big ones?
[1:31:32] <Sonny_Firestorm> Tonfa? Defensive? LUL
[1:31:33] <+zanz_san> I rely on them for later fruit
[1:31:37] <%Saadi90> FIFA stream when?
[1:31:40] <GhoulishCripple> poison on this big spin on the splitstaff is good
[1:31:41] <youngking_kush> I dont think you see big Sudama till later tho
[1:31:41] <+Nomenanza> @youngking_kush oh right yeah
[1:31:42] <%AHomeschoolDropout> booba snake lady
[1:31:42] <captainnathaniel> @PatStaresAt give him dirt balls whe you find them
[1:31:43] <+TheBitingIrish> We do a 🤏 gambling
[1:31:45] <+TopTieramisu> succ
[1:32:09] <+zanz_san> brute counter is best
[1:32:12] <%Axellogic> @Sonny_Firestorm They do have alot of armor on their attacks but yeah they're agressive
[1:32:14] <slackerunchained> Pat would rather collect a requisite amount of mythological metal chunks and a monster soul and just hand them over to a blacksmith for a cool weapon.
[1:32:19] <Profmcstevie> I do love the brute counter, got a real "SHUT THAT SHIT UP" energy
[1:32:19] <%TerpanderLux> only big win for pat
[1:32:20] <+Dova573> fuck this is kinda making me wanna do new gameplus
[1:32:22] <didgereedoodah> I always gave the Sudama rocks
[1:32:27] <youngking_kush> Worst gambling is DQ11 casino
[1:32:30] <penitentpendant> Map Dungeons on the horizon, oh boy
[1:32:33] <%TerpanderLux> yes
[1:32:38] <+Nomenanza> gotta defend the gambling goblin
[1:32:45] <yukichocomilk> SAME
[1:32:45] <@ssjklyco> That's not gambling then
[1:32:48] <%TerpanderLux> rise is finally coming out :)
[1:32:52] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> Kappa Kappa Kappa Kappa
[1:32:53] <Profmcstevie> Recipes over Gambling EVERY TIME
[1:32:54] <penitentpendant> Kek
[1:32:56] <%greasypete00> SEETHING DRAGON
[1:32:59] <youngking_kush> Wait
[1:33:03] <%cade_calrayn> looooool
[1:33:04] <+hush_wolf> will it actually run now?
[1:33:04] <artoflec> sunbreak isnt until like june right
[1:33:06] <yukichocomilk> can't wait for it to release for the first time ever
[1:33:07] <fat_burtreynolds> Rise on the pc?
[1:33:09] <Zombrocom> Just three weeks for rise PC
[1:33:10] <%Blank9> is pc version just base?
[1:33:10] <didgereedoodah> lmao
[1:33:11] <%justcallmebobplease> I have over 500 hours on the Switch demo!
[1:33:14] <%IamGrapes> oh the demo came out on PC? nice
[1:33:14] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[1:33:15] <+Zinri_Luck> same
[1:33:21] <GhoulishCripple> Seething dragon carried me through a switchglaive playthrough
[1:33:21] <DragonOfWarZro> God i dont like rise
[1:33:23] <%TerpanderLux> the based version B)
[1:33:28] <GhoulishCripple> it copes and seethes
[1:33:32] <%Warbot40> XIV scratches the same itch for me so not in a MH mood these days.
[1:33:33] <artoflec> elaBased
[1:33:36] <Profmcstevie> MH Rise is wild to only come out in January huh Kappa
[1:33:37] <%SirGO0SE> he do a yoke
[1:33:40] <%TerpanderLux> yup
[1:33:42] <+hush_wolf> so are they going to fix FF7 btw?
[1:33:43] <Zombrocom> Sunbreak comes up for PC and switch at the same time which is great
[1:33:46] <youngking_kush> Ahhh
[1:33:47] <%justcallmebobplease> @Zinri_Luck It was my first MonHun, and I'm now mildly concerned I won't like MonHun, without Wirebugs and Palamutes.
[1:33:49] <%EynoStiles> I really have high hope for sunbreak.
[1:33:52] <%cade_calrayn> the full-length, full-price demo
[1:33:58] <Sonny_Firestorm> Still treating this like souls? Guess you're more of a maso than you look. LUL
[1:33:59] <%EynoStiles> sadly i stuck on the switch
[1:34:02] <+PkSilent01> @PatStaresAt yeah its weird that they let us play a demo for almost a year and finally releasing it this coming February
[1:34:09] <%Blank9> powerful large snake
[1:34:13] <Ipsenscastle> Rise just didn't keep me interested nearly as long as World did for some reason
[1:34:14] <+olive_js> Should I play this game, chat?
[1:34:14] <defaultname3887> you already have the full game installed you lotherfucker
[1:34:15] <+Nomenanza> Endgame in Iceborne kinda killed all desire to play MH really
[1:34:17] <defaultname3887> lmao
[1:34:23] <@ssjklyco> I feel bad for people who paid full price for the FF7 Remake demo on Epic.
[1:34:29] <%Axellogic> Are you avoiding opening the chests to spite me? :V
[1:34:30] <+hush_wolf> big weird
[1:34:33] <Profmcstevie> Hell of a business tactic to let Switch owners beta test the game for so long
[1:34:34] <artoflec> i thought it ran at 60 on Switch
[1:34:37] <+polothegreatest> MHR: Godfall edition
[1:34:37] <youngking_kush> Check out that Kodama Bowl Helmet son
[1:34:38] <%TerpanderLux> :)
[1:34:44] <%EynoStiles> @justcallmebobplease dont worry. its only faster mobility cause the maps are bigger
[1:34:44] <Ipsenscastle> @Nomenanza how so?
[1:34:45] <%Agami23> not that weird, didnt world do the same thing?
[1:34:46] <%TerpanderLux> @artoflec NOPE! :)
[1:34:53] <Sonny_Firestorm> More like overloaded, but yeah, he doesn't see them.
[1:34:54] <%cade_calrayn> and to charge them for the beta test too
[1:34:55] <President_valentine> Kodama helmet is good
[1:34:57] <+Zinri_Luck> chests are random stuff anyways
[1:34:59] <@ssjklyco> both
[1:35:01] <+zanz_san> mhr endgame is boring
[1:35:01] <KatabolicRage> you missed one at the bottom I think?
[1:35:03] <Make_me_mad> Rise didn't have the longevity of world largely because of the lack of Investigations and things, I think. Those made even re-hunting monsters for parts seem more interesting.
[1:35:04] <+Zinri_Luck> dont matter
[1:35:07] <artoflec> SEETHE
[1:35:09] <%TerpanderLux> seething 😡
[1:35:11] <%Axellogic> You currently have treasure sense so Chest show up on your minimap
[1:35:21] <%Visorak6> Jesus christ this elf in the blacksmithing questline is just like half the height of normal elezens?
[1:35:21] <SaltyAzteca> pat did you find the hidden items on the map @patstaresat
[1:35:23] <youngking_kush> Look at the effect tho
[1:35:23] <Sonny_Firestorm> @Zinri_Luck Not always, some contain semi-fixed stuff.
[1:35:24] <DragonOfWarZro> So glad i cant play Rise on a real console with more power than my phone
[1:35:24] <%TerpanderLux> im SEETHING 😡
[1:35:26] <%AHomeschoolDropout> @PatStaresAt did you read the FF14 official school manga
[1:35:31] <+Nomenanza> @Ipsenscastle really didn't enjoy the last couple of monsters they added and the grind became unbearable coupled with clutch claw softening being a necessity
[1:35:31] <Make_me_mad> Rise just asks you to do the same hunts over and over to raise your level. Having to grind to 100 to fight the last monster is fucking ridiculous.
[1:35:31] <%isolex_> isolex_ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 20 months! 20 months of orbman. Thanks for creating all my obsessions. Finally joined a static for the first time, and loving every minute of it. Have you done the normal raid yet?
[1:35:33] <+zanz_san> no apex armor in mhr
[1:35:35] <+Dova573> talking about monhun, man I cant agree with some of the old mh vet wanting the series to go back like it was before world
[1:35:38] <superchunk121> Malding Dragon
[1:35:38] <@GeneralSCPatton> Did you nab a Kodama blessing from the shrine?
[1:35:44] <ExpressNode> It ran a 60th of 30fps if that's what you mean
[1:35:45] <+bravofifeniner> Where's he at in the game? Has he fought blue man?
[1:35:55] <+Dova573> like those people are crazy
[1:36:08] <%captain_thickthighs> evening peoples
[1:36:11] <%Axellogic> just pump like one point of stamina
[1:36:12] <KatabolicRage> think you still have a side mission at the bottom there
[1:36:13] <Ipsenscastle> @Nomenanza that's fair, I checked out just before Alatreon and gathered that it and Fatalis were just punishing
[1:36:16] <SaltyAzteca> @dob
[1:36:19] <DragonOfWarZro> Bro i finally got around ta Val last week
[1:36:23] <%Axellogic> Use some of your spirit stones
[1:36:24] <GhoulishCripple> pop spirit stones
[1:36:24] <Profmcstevie> There are aesthetic components of Pre World Monhun I like, the freedom in everything else can stay
[1:36:27] <zenith0111> I miss Tenchu
[1:36:34] <Sonny_Firestorm> Levels don't give familariarity.
[1:36:36] <Zombrocom> Didn't you get a spirt stone? Maybe that's enough?
[1:36:42] <shiny_prinny> 1 or 2 stamina levels might put you under
[1:36:45] <SaltyAzteca> @dova573 youre telling me you don't want to return to stationary healing where you have to stand still?
[1:36:47] <%Axellogic> You prolly have enough spirit stones for a level
[1:36:48] <%EynoStiles> i really like the slinger, but the clutch claw was just ehh
[1:36:51] <+zanz_san> I beat extreme behemoth 50+ times
[1:36:51] <+Nomenanza> @Ipsenscastle ye Alatreon just wasn't fun imo
[1:36:54] <KatabolicRage> you missed a side mission I think dude
[1:37:04] <%TerpanderLux> nobunga
[1:37:10] <Sonny_Firestorm> No, we gon' see Nobunaga now.
[1:37:12] <GhoulishCripple> he can go back if he did
[1:37:12] <+tempestzephyr> always the nobu
[1:37:14] <Sonny_Firestorm> Nobunobu.
[1:37:17] <Brutusness> Nobunaga is japanese jesus
[1:37:17] <RubberFistFight> odo nobundanobu
[1:37:21] <GhoulishCripple> you're not locked into the regions

[1:38:16] <%Axellogic> You can always go back and do any mission you are never locked out
[1:38:17] <+Nimbus272> wtf is this dub
[1:38:23] <youngking_kush> You can go back anytime
[1:38:24] <Sonny_Firestorm> Reminder: Dosan's daughter is your HALF SISTER, so Nobu is technically your bother-in-law. Kappa
[1:38:25] <%cade_calrayn> @KosOrSomeSayKosm_ yup

[1:38:38] <+zanz_san> masamune date is better than nobunaga

[1:39:11] <%maskedriderhero> "Why is your hair red"
[1:39:14] <jetstreamlove_R> Nobunaga sounds brutal
[1:39:15] <%EynoStiles> it cause they are blue
[1:39:16] <captainnathaniel> "You are caucasian?"
[1:39:18] <Sonny_Firestorm> The peacock used to be so OP in Nioh 1. But they nerfed it in N2.
[1:39:21] <fat_burtreynolds> Hey Pat
[1:39:24] <Astrophizz> soulless redhead eyes
[1:39:24] <%EynoStiles> sus... bro

[1:39:53] <%greasypete00> that boss was kinda fucked
[1:39:54] <didgereedoodah> she's the boss from Nioh 1
[1:39:56] <+Dova573> hahaha
[1:39:56] <Sonny_Firestorm> Yup. LUL
[1:39:56] <RubberFistFight> yeah thats Yuki-onna from Nioh 1
[1:39:56] <slackerunchained> Butterflies from Seath the Scaleless, I guess.
[1:39:57] <+zeroarturia> Lady Noh, Nobunaga's wife and yes your sister
[1:39:57] <+pectusumbra> Nobunaga just wants to chill with his hot supernatural wife
[1:39:58] <%superc37> no it's nobunagas wife
[1:39:58] <jetstreamlove_R> Secret waifu
[1:40:00] <zenith0111> Uh oh
[1:40:05] <%AgniBrandt> OH FUCK how did I never notice that?!
[1:40:06] <+Dova573> she was a tough bitch
[1:40:06] <%valriot> Your sister FUCKS Nobunaga
[1:40:07] <%Agami23> she is a big wall. loved that fight
[1:40:09] <%EynoStiles> renaming her to ice bitch. please... confirm
[1:40:09] <Zombrocom> That makes nonuanaga your brother in law BTW
[1:40:11] <bxdragon> And now to never acknowledge that you are half siblings smile.
[1:40:14] <%cade_calrayn> yeah she goes kinda superpowered after she dies
[1:40:16] <+tempestzephyr> you gonna bang your sister
[1:40:19] <%zeroarturia> zeroarturia subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 43 months! 
[1:40:19] <+polothegreatest> yup
[1:40:23] <+Crunchy_the_clown> Really?  I beat her like my 4th try
[1:40:23] <fistynopunches> yeah just her huh? not the super boss where you have to fight her and another hard boss at the same time?
[1:40:27] <%zeroarturia> Weird Prime sub
[1:40:29] <RubberFistFight> @EynoStiles I mean "Yuki-onna" means Snow Lady, so it's not far off
[1:40:31] <%EynoStiles> sneaky sis
[1:40:31] <srv4254> all her moves track u super hard in nioh 1
[1:40:33] <artoflec> wow that guy got FUCKED
[1:40:33] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> that so
[1:40:35] <KatabolicRage> that dude just got monke'd
[1:40:36] <+Nomenanza> jesus that dude got wrecked
[1:40:40] <+hush_wolf> that was.... awful
[1:40:42] <President_valentine> that dude got fucked
[1:40:43] <%Axellogic> I dont think the monkey is the one that needed help
[1:40:44] <jetstreamlove_R> Nobunaga bangs your sister for easy political power
[1:40:51] <RubberFistFight> @srv4254 the ground stomp where she freezes an area around her is total horsecrap
[1:40:53] <RubberFistFight> sometimes it hits you
[1:40:55] <RubberFistFight> sometimes it doens't
[1:40:56] <DragonOfWarZro> Yuki onna was Goat'd
[1:41:08] <RubberFistFight> and she gets into spamming it if you're unlucky
[1:41:12] <%TerpanderLux> kill monke
[1:41:13] <RubberFistFight> so you can't get near her to hit her
[1:41:16] <+Crunchy_the_clown> has Pat hit strong attack after they get their Ki depleted yet?
[1:41:18] <Sonny_Firestorm> @jetstreamlove_R Actually Dosan told her "if he really is a fool, take this dagger and end him" She never used it.
[1:41:19] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> forest, but this time teal instead of purple
[1:41:23] <%zeroarturia> Also Noh and Nobunaga as double boss duo was so fucking frustrating to fight
[1:41:25] <Zombrocom> The fact that ice lady is your half sister and nobunaga is your brother in law is NEVER mentioned or brought up is so bizarre.
[1:41:37] <youngking_kush> Yeah they do alot of that
[1:41:39] <yukichocomilk> you'll be seeing this same level a lot LUL
[1:41:49] <Profmcstevie> put it in a bag, shake it up, boom level design
[1:41:52] <srv4254> the dual ninja fight was worse for me infinite projectiles
[1:41:55] <Make_me_mad> @Zombrocom I mean you didn't grow up together. You're barely related.
[1:41:56] <fat_burtreynolds> Are those blue things really chests?
[1:41:58] <artoflec> Pat semi-related to Nioh, but do you think a slightly different outfit but a different moveset counts as a "new" enemy? I think moveset means it does.
[1:42:02] <%Savarro> @zeroarturia I remember loading into that fight and going NOPE then leaving LUL
[1:42:07] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> the bow and gun in this feel AMAZING compared to souls
[1:42:10] <RubberFistFight> @Zombrocom i know, right?
[1:42:10] <jetstreamlove_R> @Sonny_Firestorm Nobunaga has that effect on women So not surprised there LUL
[1:42:10] <%hax_metatron> Reusing levels? J U S T N I OH S T U F F
[1:42:23] <KatabolicRage> I mean, doesn't this game give new moves to enemies on new game plusses?
[1:42:23] <shiny_prinny> aren't the bow buttons the same?
[1:42:27] <KatabolicRage> and shit like that?
[1:42:28] <%Hamborgini> yeah, compare and contrast shooting a bow in this to Reggie trying to use a box in DS1
[1:42:30] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> Its insane how pretty much everyone knows the characters parents but it never gets brought up
[1:42:52] <Sonny_Firestorm> @KatabolicRage At first it's just the bosses, but in the last 2 difficulties it's everything.
[1:42:58] <%TerpanderLux> >:(
[1:43:07] <Sonny_Firestorm> Hide literally prefers to die over speak words.
[1:43:07] <%Axellogic> They love when you kill tho
[1:43:11] <foxenco> @shiny_prinny he's comparing to souls games in general it seems
[1:43:12] <RubberFistFight> lol that last little thing before they die where they push their tits up. The designers fucking K N E W
[1:43:14] <captainnathaniel> "shove me up that guy's ass"
[1:43:19] <fat_burtreynolds> Combodied
[1:43:27] <californaya> dude, you can just do a Shooting Star Press in this?
[1:43:28] <%Axellogic> Corruption steals enemy ki
[1:43:32] <californaya> I might need to get this
[1:43:32] <Sonny_Firestorm> Corruption is anti-human element.
[1:43:36] <Zombrocom> Corruption is a ki drain best on humans
[1:43:38] <Sonny_Firestorm> Purity is anti-yokai.
[1:43:42] <shiny_prinny> @foxenco oh that makes more sense
[1:43:45] <%Agami23> bonus ki damage to humans i think
[1:43:49] <youngking_kush> Corruption STEALS Ki
[1:43:51] <%Hamborgini> @PatStaresAt Corruption = more ki damage, plus absorb ki when the enemy has the corruption status
[1:44:00] <%justcallmebobplease> DAMN I love how much damage bows do in this game
[1:44:05] <President_valentine> Purity will also remove buffs from enemies
[1:44:06] <%justcallmebobplease> So much more satisfying than DS
[1:44:17] <GhoulishCripple> corruption Fist BF purity Odachi GF
[1:44:20] <%TerpanderLux> OH SHIT
[1:44:24] <%jingokrieg> YOOOOOOOOOO BIG SNEK, I need to play more of this

[1:44:57] <Profmcstevie> Weaker ass barbPathetic
[1:44:59] <ferbeholds> monke
[1:45:15] <%cade_calrayn> I love that the snake ability is basically just hitting the enemy with an snake-shaped 18-wheeler
[1:45:16] <%VentWilsn> Curaga ass
[1:45:25] <+TheBitingIrish> I think it's closer to 'Crass'
[1:45:31] <Sonny_Firestorm> @PatStaresAt Suggestion: go on settings and put the menu to show "item Lv" instead of "atk/def" will make ur life easier.
[1:45:44] <%Agami23> oh right. this.
[1:45:48] <%AlteisenReiseZ> dat's a lotta graves
[1:45:58] <InkyDraconian> nuffin like christmas music and monster  slayin

[1:46:26] <+hush_wolf> you i love this track
[1:46:29] <+hush_wolf> yo
[1:46:36] <Sonny_Firestorm> @PatStaresAt Not sort by level, it's so that the number shown next to the item on the list is lv instead of base value.
[1:46:46] <Sonny_Firestorm> In the options menu
[1:47:11] <RubberFistFight> ohhh you got lucky
[1:47:11] <%Blank9> I like the option to show hp/ki/anima number values
[1:47:18] <RubberFistFight> their grab attack is fuckin bullshit
[1:47:21] <Sonny_Firestorm> that too
[1:47:25] <President_valentine> the endgame gauntlets are nuts though
[1:47:40] <Profmcstevie> No rest for the orb
[1:47:42] <%Axellogic> They're actually spawning when you arent paying attention
[1:47:42] <Gelphaze> Get him Pat fuck his shit UP!

[1:49:04] <%Axellogic> You gain tons of purple when in dark realms
[1:49:13] <Ferakin> Patrick, just high stance them
[1:49:18] <Ferakin> Their horns break to easily
[1:49:19] <californaya> get dunked
[1:49:20] <Who_lio42> aberrants are more annoying
[1:49:30] <%Hamborgini> nice monke
[1:49:32] <%TerpanderLux> chjbBoClap
[1:49:39] <%TerpanderLux> monkaS
[1:49:39] <%charp35> If you use high stance to hit the yokai's horns it does a lot of stamina damage by the way
[1:49:40] <+Crunchy_the_clown> DT
[1:49:41] <+NeonFishFace> you got this
[1:49:44] <penitentpendant> "Die Kill Stealer!"

[1:50:07] <%Deft_Thought> That was a damn brawl

[1:50:15] <%cade_calrayn> you just got Crazy Talk'd
[1:50:15] <fistynopunches> Nioh loves horde missions
[1:50:16] <%Axellogic> Thats pretty normal for gauntlet missions
[1:50:17] <+zanz_san> SNAKE ASSIST FIR THE WIN
[1:50:17] <%Agami23> that took me days
[1:50:24] <President_valentine> you think that's rough you ain't seen anything
[1:50:27] <Profmcstevie> That dude just jumped down and got bodied what was he THINKING
[1:50:28] <%cade_calrayn> "oh please let that be the end" WHAM
[1:50:30] <Make_me_mad> My favorite thing about Nioh is walking into an area and seeing a ton of graves. I know it's gonna be fucked.
[1:50:30] <Gelphaze> DAME! DAME!
[1:50:33] <iamnuff> That sort of bullshit makes me want to go in with a blue buddy.
[1:50:35] <+UltraViolet371> you're just like, good at this nioh thing
[1:50:36] <RubberFistFight> @Axellogic that was one of the easier ones lol
[1:50:43] <OverlordedK> Makes me laugh even after the nerfs snake summon still too good to not use
[1:50:45] <+hush_wolf> we go again
[1:50:46] <Who_lio42> its such a "oh no" feeling when you walk into an area w TONS of graves
[1:50:52] <fistynopunches> Nioh 1 had crazy ass gauntlets
[1:50:57] <captainnathaniel> i need a cig after that one
[1:50:59] <%Tragosavich> Who remembers the hord mode in Nioh 1 were you fight all the bosses from the DLC in one fight?
[1:51:04] <didgereedoodah> I just had flashbacks to the tournament mission
[1:51:18] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> conehead
[1:51:27] <Who_lio42> i know i did that,  but dont remember much of nioh 1
[1:51:31] <jetstreamlove_R> I heard legends of broken builds in this game that make speedrunners blush
[1:51:35] <Sonny_Firestorm> @didgereedoodah Nioh 1 or Nioh 2 tournament?
[1:51:35] <RubberFistFight> @fistynopunches god there's one in that underground catacomb thing where 3 of those onryudo spawn, the two-eyed fuckers with the long tongues
[1:51:35] <+bravofifeniner> Has pat visited the teahouse yet?
[1:51:37] <iamnuff> I tried to stick with light armour, but to be honest I don't even know if it was worth it.
[1:51:43] <%TerpanderLux> thats the largest hat on earth
[1:51:46] <RubberFistFight> but you're in this room that's barely bigger than a fucking shoebox
[1:51:50] <RubberFistFight> and they summon flame skulls

[1:54:35] <%notsoy> LOL i guess when you "lock in" the bad ones, the fourth slot will only give good ones
[1:54:36] <youngking_kush> You get so much shit in this game lol
[1:54:37] <%TerpanderLux> this skill tree makes me want to die
[1:54:48] <GhoulishCripple> once you get one to like 7-8% it's a big difference
[1:54:51] <%AgniBrandt> @notsoy That is precisely correct
[1:54:57] <%Axellogic> I dont care much for the stance switching skills on odachi either
[1:55:03] <youngking_kush> You can view the skills in a list too. Triangle I think
[1:55:08] <luckyifpurple> Just rush to falling snow and falling snow redux

[1:55:27] <didgereedoodah> stance switching is really cool once you figure it out
[1:55:39] <jetstreamlove_R> god i miss FFX sphere grid so much
[1:55:45] <%PMAvers> The ??? mission eventually unlocks to get those via basically MSQ progress.
[1:55:46] <+Gamingand808s> sasaki kojiros signiture move" swallow
[1:55:47] <GhoulishCripple> stance switching is busted strong
[1:55:56] <iamnuff> If you get one that you don't want, you can disable it in your moveslist.
[1:56:08] <captainnathaniel> dont forget you get points by using hair
[1:56:18] <RubberFistFight> @GhoulishCripple yeah if you can master it. If not, you go BWUUUUUHHHH in the middle of a fight and eat a facefull of yokai dick.
[1:56:20] <%Visorak6> He has auto use hair on
[1:56:20] <%Axellogic> Stomp is great
[1:56:25] <iamnuff> I think hair is auto-used now
[1:56:29] <Sonny_Firestorm> You can set hair to auto-use on menu.
[1:56:48] <didgereedoodah> Opportunist is nuts
[1:57:10] <Sonny_Firestorm> Oh this is gonna be fun.
[1:57:14] <Sonny_Firestorm> First real human boss.

[1:57:20] <+bravofifeniner> But he's using the dub.
[1:57:23] <GhoulishCripple> @rubberfistfight **suddenly runs out of ki and stops, dies instantly ** everytime
[1:57:24] <youngking_kush> That's your whole reason for being here lol
[1:57:25] <+bravofifeniner> So he's going to miss something cool.
[1:57:25] <%Hamborgini> okay ham zima
[1:57:26] <+ReallyBigRocks> this is a good one
[1:57:26] <iamnuff> I really liked ninjutsu. I used a lot of firebombs in my game.

[1:59:08] <$ArcanumArcanum> if Gyobu Masataka Oniwa had a spirit animal what would it be?
[1:59:09] <Ipsenscastle> do not pursue Lu Bu
[1:59:10] <Who_lio42> time is convoluted in this game
[1:59:15] <%DashXero> Four years of ball scratching... Yup. Nobunaga was REALLY ambitious.
[1:59:18] <%Hamborgini> nothing happened for 4 years, you had to walk all the way here

[2:05:51] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> >woman
[2:05:53] <DSD24> I love those weapons
[2:05:55] <iamnuff> It's prolly in your codex if you wanna read it
[2:05:55] <GhoulishCripple> Gaki in a wig. killer Grandma
[2:06:02] <Sonny_Firestorm> Ungrateful mothers and granmas.
[2:06:02] <jetstreamlove_R> spongy motherfifer
[2:06:03] <+pectusumbra> basically cannibal mountain hab
[2:06:06] <+pectusumbra> *hag
[2:06:11] <captainnathaniel> @PatStaresAt thats a japanese boomer
[2:06:18] <+Nomenanza> that yokai fucked so many people up in the demo
[2:06:24] <%InternetShis> InternetShis subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months! Second trimester of stream baby, pat the orb, shake the bag, all that jazz. Also finally leveling alts in 14, including Dark Knight FROM THIRTY. Should I bite the bullet, buy the skip, and whack a dummy for two hours, or grind trials as off tank until 90?
[2:06:27] <GrandpaPhoenix> It's Mrs. Cutter from Okami. Your signature crossover
[2:06:27] <%Axellogic> Itll be the same level as whatever you drop
[2:06:35] <GhoulishCripple> oh no
[2:06:36] <RubberFistFight> @Nomenanza dude they were the bane of my fucking existence on so many maps
[2:06:37] <+Dova573> What did you tell her pat for her to pull a knife on you?
[2:06:43] <%Axellogic> Well good news circle
[2:06:44] <%TerpanderLux> :)
[2:06:44] <GoldySUP> LUL
[2:06:50] <@GeneralSCPatton> This level is a bit rough on navigation
[2:07:07] <Sonny_Firestorm> @Dova573 Arrow in her horn.
[2:07:10] <%Savarro> I don't think I've ever gotten anything worth from the Sudama
[2:07:11] <GhoulishCripple> these Japanese sound suspiciously British
[2:07:12] <%Axellogic> This level is very twisting
[2:07:19] <jetstreamlove_R> game's really pretty whit the visuals
[2:07:24] <%Axellogic> Keep an eye on your minimap blue dots are chest
[2:07:29] <%hax_metatron> This is a fun level IMO
[2:07:30] <%SharkMissile> This level can get difficult
[2:07:32] <captainnathaniel> i cant believe these dead people got better VAs than Oda Nobunaga
[2:07:33] <%SharkMissile> to navigate
[2:07:45] <%hax_metatron> But once again ruined by Nioh 2 repeating the level like 10 times
[2:07:48] <GhoulishCripple> @savarro there's a chance to get a kodama core for a soul core and the kodama core is useful
[2:07:55] <DSD24> Wake up throw
[2:07:58] <%TerpanderLux> monke SMASH jermaSun
[2:08:00] <%Axellogic> monkey jump
[2:08:06] <Sonny_Firestorm> I liked how Nioh 1 handled it's dubbing better.
[2:08:16] <RubberFistFight> @captainnathaniel I'm just stunned they pronounce his name right, instead of like "no-boo-nuh-guh" or some shit
[2:08:17] <%DashXero> He led his shot and still missed.
[2:08:18] <jetstreamlove_R> @captainnathaniel you could say the Va's were DYING for the role LOL
[2:08:34] <+Dova573> Man I wonder if Stranger of CHAOS is gonna have the guardian spirit system but its FF summons
[2:08:46] <artoflec> i like the physics on your helmet tail
[2:08:50] <+JustToWatch> has Pat gotten his title feats?
[2:08:56] <+zanz_san> you unlock the fist training mission
[2:08:59] <iamnuff> yes
[2:09:04] <%Hamborgini> @JustToWatch he did
[2:09:07] <%DashXero> Yes.
[2:09:09] <DSD24> Pretty much this is a long one
[2:09:10] <Sonny_Firestorm> They're doing Stranger of CHAOS as a variety project, so expect things to be different enough.
[2:09:12] <%DashXero> On both accounts.
[2:09:14] <youngking_kush> It's pretty large
[2:09:19] <%abrupt_abe> VoteNay
[2:09:20] <RubberFistFight> just go for 10 hours then Kappa
[2:09:27] <Spagheddies> This is a bit of a long one, but you're making good time.
[2:09:28] <General_Terro> i hated this level cuz i kept getting flipped around
[2:09:29] <%Axellogic> Yamanba cant deal with how fast fists are
[2:09:32] <%hax_metatron> Worst enemy
[2:09:34] <GhoulishCripple> she wants your sweet meats
[2:09:35] <jetstreamlove_R> Nioh is nothing but a game about saving babies from monstars
[2:09:36] <+JustToWatch> she envies your youth
[2:09:38] <+Local16> It'll either take a bit or it'll be really short
[2:09:40] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> 24 hours stream confirmed
[2:09:41] <fistynopunches> sir tes sir oohrah lol
[2:09:42] <%DashXero> You didn't eat your porridge.
[2:09:46] <DSD24> The worst name is yet to come
[2:09:48] <%cade_calrayn> because she's jealous of your hat, Pat
[2:09:49] <DSD24> enemy
[2:09:49] <+zanz_san> 40% done
[2:09:58] <srv4254> nice
[2:09:58] <%Axellogic> You are about a third through the level
[2:10:00] <%Saadi90> That’s what Grandmas do
[2:10:01] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> rip monke
[2:10:04] <tetrabrick1lt> LUL
[2:10:17] <fistynopunches> enki really becomes easier over time
[2:10:17] <+zanz_san> murder
[2:10:21] <%Axellogic> Both paths converge
[2:10:23] <%DashXero> Both of those are the wrong way.
[2:10:27] <GhoulishCripple> my create a character has a frog tattoo on his back. therefore he's stronger than pats
[2:10:28] <Make_me_mad> This is why Nioh is so good. If you do well you just wreck the enemies and it feels great. But they can also beat your ass no problem if you mess up.
[2:10:29] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> both paths take to the same place
[2:10:29] <Sonny_Firestorm> it's not right or wrong, it's long or short
[2:10:36] <ytwitchmeng> Odachi...more like...o PAT chi!! Am i right?
[2:10:37] <yukichocomilk> everything kinda links together
[2:10:37] <+zanz_san> harder way
[2:10:38] <+Dova573> I do love that the combat can be summed up as BULLY OR BE BULLIED
[2:10:41] <DSD24> Wow your antlers go well with your hat
[2:10:48] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> we'll be here a while
[2:11:02] <%Supwizy> Just follow your heart
[2:11:05] <%Axellogic> I dont get the point of the big odachi block its so slow
[2:11:18] <DSD24> Stinger!
[2:11:18] <+pectusumbra> Just had a cursed thought: Odie Nobunaga.
[2:11:27] <Sonny_Firestorm> mad skills granma LUL
[2:11:30] <jetstreamlove_R> look at that goober having the time of his life
[2:11:41] <RubberFistFight> yes
[2:11:43] <%Visorak6> Yep
[2:11:44] <%abrupt_abe> Yup
[2:11:47] <shiny_prinny> yeah
[2:11:47] <RubberFistFight> sometimes they talk when you kill them
[2:11:49] <%DashXero> You disappointed Nana.
[2:11:50] <%Hamborgini> hey, you can understand some of them now
[2:11:54] <%Axellogic> you are understanding what soul cores say now
[2:11:57] <GhoulishCripple> yeah you start to understand what they yell when you get their cores
[2:11:57] <captainnathaniel> OK BOOMER
[2:11:59] <+Nomenanza> apparently long stick aint long enough
[2:12:00] <RubberFistFight> it gives you little tidbits of what those yokai are and how they were created
[2:12:08] <youngking_kush> He's starting to learn Yokai
[2:12:09] <+zanz_san> you know yokai language now
[2:12:11] <+Dova573> why you kill yo grandma pat
[2:12:14] <%cade_calrayn> that wasn't a soul core, that's just its dying cry
[2:12:15] <jetstreamlove_R> even jobbers get character development
[2:12:19] <Sonny_Firestorm> @Nomenanza Nah fam, there are longer sticks in this game
[2:12:32] <%cade_calrayn> they are indeed
[2:12:32] <Sonny_Firestorm> @PatStaresAt Welcome to the reality of the Sengoku Era.
[2:12:36] <fat_burtreynolds> Grandma tried to poison me KappaClaus
[2:12:38] <RubberFistFight> like half of the nure-onna ones are just like "HOLY SHIT I FUCKING LOVE EATING MEN LIKE GODDAMN" but said in a smoky "ara ara" voice
[2:12:43] <jetstreamlove_R> Pat's character sounds like Link
[2:12:43] <+pectusumbra> pat's grandma was the one with the poisonous cooking right?
[2:12:44] <Sonny_Firestorm> Warring States was a shitshow
[2:12:45] <+Nomenanza> @Sonny_Firestorm oh boy I used splitstaff for a good bit I know lol
[2:12:48] <+zanz_san> nice
[2:12:52] <@GeneralSCPatton> Acquire Other Realm Resistance, or perish
[2:12:52] <%MidnightBurst12> shit sucks out here, man
[2:12:53] <Make_me_mad> These Yokai zones are fucked. With lower stamina regen even the weak enemies become a serious threat.
[2:12:57] <%cade_calrayn> kill that Monke and you'll get your colors back
[2:12:59] <ytwitchmeng> Does Nioh 2 have the literal shitzone like in Nioh 1 ?
[2:13:02] <+zanz_san> you're getting good pat
[2:13:15] <iamnuff> Purged
[2:13:22] <%abrupt_abe> Doesn't it feel good starting to wreck them
[2:13:24] <Sonny_Firestorm> @ytwitchmeng Yes
[2:13:25] <luckyifpurple> That heavy follow up on the odachi lasted me the entire game its so good
[2:13:25] <%Axellogic> mimix
[2:13:28] <%TerpanderLux> trolled
[2:13:29] <%Axellogic> oh well
[2:13:34] <jetstreamlove_R> @ytwitchmeng yub
[2:13:34] <DSD24> DO A FLIP
[2:13:44] <%TerpanderLux> hes a friend :)
[2:13:47] <youngking_kush> @zanz_san Pat was good in Nioh 1 really that game is just less enjoyable
[2:13:50] <ExpressNode> Tanuki?
[2:13:50] <+Inferno_Icon> were these types of zones not in nioh 1?
[2:13:51] <%cade_calrayn> they weren't yelling at you, Pat, those were the memories of the people who became Yokai - the lady and her kid were arguing
[2:13:53] <%Savarro> I love those guys
[2:13:57] <GhoulishCripple> @patstaresat whistle at every big chest before you open it
[2:14:00] <+KBGuilty> EAT THE HAIR
[2:14:04] <ytwitchmeng> Great poop monsters return
[2:14:06] <jetstreamlove_R> what a friendly satan man
[2:14:10] <DSD24> @Inferno_Icon Yokai Realm is new to Nioh 2
[2:14:11] <%DianaTheAscian> yeah
[2:14:13] <%AgniBrandt> @PatStaresAt If I remember correctly, the mimics will ONLY use emotes on your first page--you can totally swap in others if you'd prefer
[2:14:14] <GhoulishCripple> Mimics open themselves
[2:14:19] <Sonny_Firestorm> @PatStaresAt Fun Trivia: there's a tell for these mimic chests, and if you whistle instead of opening chest it skips the jumpscare
[2:14:22] <%TerpanderLux> what if you were a spidered man
[2:14:24] <%Axellogic> Kodama on minimap
[2:14:25] <ammobasket> that's 100% a great part
[2:14:28] <captainnathaniel> those guys wear their testivles on their heads
[2:14:33] <RubberFistFight> @AgniBrandt no i've had them use emotes i had unequipped
[2:14:39] <%notsoy> to be fair, if i could do flips, i would definitely do it any time i could just to stunt
[2:14:40] <%Supwizy> I love how they say that in the ps4 games too
[2:14:41] <RubberFistFight> and they got cross coz i was taking too long to find it
[2:14:42] <Sonny_Firestorm> yeah, those are their balls
[2:14:58] <jetstreamlove_R> always fun trip finding the baby ghosts
[2:15:05] <%bravebravesrobin> finished RE: WTRC the other day, and oh boy, why tf did they make my man Leon such a dumbass?  I realize he's a rookie cop, but I half expected him to shoot himself while pointing the barrel at his face... Cheer500
[2:15:13] <+Crunchy_the_clown> Odachi is great
[2:15:15] <iamnuff> High Stance in Switchglaive was my shit.
[2:15:17] <artoflec> i mean obviously
[2:15:23] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> Easily
[2:15:23] <DSD24> Good
[2:15:26] <%DashXero> Really?
[2:15:26] <youngking_kush> Literally
[2:15:28] <%DashXero> Huh.
[2:15:28] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> yeah this is more of a dedicated action game
[2:15:30] <DSD24> I miss Ninja Gaiden
[2:15:31] <+Nomenanza> Nioh 2 is awesome. And yeah view it more as Diable x Ninja Gaiden
[2:15:34] <+Dova573> Is missing one thing
[2:15:35] <+sonofrobin73> Yep
[2:15:35] <GhoulishCripple> if Nioh2 had a fully fledged world and not missions it would feel a lot more like dark souls
[2:15:36] <%justcallmebobplease> Ninja Diablo Gaiden
[2:15:36] <%valriot> Its Ninja Gaiden/Diablo
[2:15:36] <%abrupt_abe> And then it turns into Diablo at the end
[2:15:38] <%Axellogic> I always treat it as a coop action diablo
[2:15:38] <Spagheddies> Oh, the combat is infinitely better than Souls. And hey, guess who developed Ninja Gaiden.
[2:15:38] <+Crunchy_the_clown> First time through was tonfa and odachi in this game
[2:15:40] <+pectusumbra> With Devil May Cry flavors on top
[2:15:41] <didgereedoodah> easily
[2:15:44] <%Hamborgini> it's the onimusha sequels capcom will never make
[2:15:48] <jetstreamlove_R> This is better than most dark souls. Like rivals Elden Ring mechanic wise
[2:15:49] <+zanz_san> Yeah ninja gaiden
[2:15:53] <%cvp5127> this came out years ago pat
[2:15:55] <%captain_thickthighs> it's missing a bit of special sauce
[2:15:59] <artoflec> i dunno all ive seen of elden ring are a lot of the same ideas, with the same combat so im just kinda waiting to see.
[2:16:03] <OverlordedK> that's just the fault of your timing in playing this pat lol
[2:16:03] <yukichocomilk> the bosses and level design are just unmatched in souls unfortunately. but this game has much better combat
[2:16:04] <Spagheddies> Quick reminder to everyone that this game was developed by Team Ninja.
[2:16:06] <%YakumoYomi> I too am excited for Big/Wide Dark Souls
[2:16:07] <youngking_kush> Yeah, it is missing that sense of wonderment
[2:16:08] <%G_Thunders> I just want to know if it has a sci fi twist
[2:16:10] <%TerpanderLux> yeah
[2:16:10] <DSD24> There are cool levels in this
[2:16:11] <shiny_prinny> souls has more a compelling world basically
[2:16:12] <Spagheddies> You know, the Ninja Gaiden people.
[2:16:18] <%Visorak6> It's limited by its setting
[2:16:22] <fruit_pie_the_magician> It's basically Dark Souls Godhand
[2:16:23] <%VentWilsn> yea, those cinematic angles remind of the xbox ninja gaidens
[2:16:24] <%valriot> Nioh is a videogame ass videogame
[2:16:30] <+sonofrobin73> The levels do get a bit more interesting the  further you get in
[2:16:31] <RubberFistFight> @youngking_kush the later boss battles definitely fill in for that
[2:16:32] <KatabolicRage> enemy yokai's stamina is a little wierd
[2:16:33] <GoldySUP> They do because you dispelled the area
[2:16:35] <+Dova573> Honestly this is why IM SO EXCITED for Stranger of paradise, because doing nioh shit in a FF game sounds way cooler
[2:16:36] <%valriot> They do
[2:16:38] <GhoulishCripple> they lose it all when you break a dark realm
[2:16:39] <%AgniBrandt> That one DOES have zero stamina
[2:16:40] <%DashXero> That's because you beat the maker of the dark realm already.
[2:16:40] <%Hamborgini> they run out of stamina automatically when you dispel the dark realm
[2:16:40] <TurtlesAndTentacles> so you don't like the Japanese stuff?
[2:16:41] <Sonny_Firestorm> @PatStaresAt It's cause dispelling the Dark Realm drains them
[2:16:41] <%TerpanderLux> whos pat?
[2:16:42] <%Savarro> I love the sengoku era so Nioh has always been my aesthetic
[2:16:42] <+sonofrobin73> There's some pretty wacky level designs
[2:16:43] <neekocheeko> nioh needs more enemy variety too
[2:16:43] <GhoulishCripple> then get it back over time
[2:16:43] <%Axellogic> They do cause you killed the dark realm but they start recovery right away
[2:16:43] <%Supwizy> Well good thing team ninja's next game is Final fantasy and it plays just like nioh
[2:16:47] <%cade_calrayn> @PatStaresAt once you break the Yokai world, every remaining Yokai is left with no stamina
[2:16:49] <toahmes> There are some levels in this game that are fucking sick
[2:16:50] <+sonofrobin73> like the mausoleum of evil is pretty cool
[2:16:51] <Ferakin> Its because you ended the dark zone and that breaks all the yokai's ki bars
[2:16:52] <+McSoliace> tbf this game came out before Elden ring had shown gameplay
[2:16:52] <%CatastropheCorvid> @PatStaresAt That happens when you clear the dark realm and they haven't yet recovered.
[2:16:56] <iamnuff> granny gon slide
[2:16:58] <%DashXero> DAMN.
[2:16:59] <luckyifpurple> Granny don't fuck around
[2:16:59] <Who_lio42> im super exicted for CHAOS souls but still need a dang ps5
[2:16:59] <+Nomenanza> and THAT is what fucked people up in a demo
[2:17:00] <+pectusumbra> she got ya
[2:17:01] <%abrupt_abe> cpgrimER cpgrimEL
[2:17:01] <youngking_kush> @rubberfistfight I agree, the final DLC especially
[2:17:02] <scrumbotime> Grandma Never Stop
[2:17:02] <+Dova573> Also probs gonna take a week off work for elden ring
[2:17:03] <%superc37> its cuz dispelling the yokai realm depletes all their stamina
[2:17:03] <jetstreamlove_R> 1st death in mission
[2:17:07] <%DashXero> Granny's got frame traps.
[2:17:13] <didgereedoodah> ice skating
[2:17:16] <jetstreamlove_R> Granny angy
[2:17:19] <%Axellogic> Well good news is those enemies in the village wont come back
[2:17:49] <ytwitchmeng> Babayaga defeeat
[2:17:50] <DSD24> Grandma got run over by a Yokai!
[2:17:56] <jetstreamlove_R> Dattebayo fuckers!
[2:17:57] <RubberFistFight> oh i was afk for a sec, did Pat get whacked by Grandma?
[2:18:09] <DSD24> @RubberFistFight Yep
[2:18:18] <iamnuff> @RubberFistFight Ye
[2:18:30] <RubberFistFight> it was inevitaburu
[2:18:31] <Mister_McDerp> grandma is too powerful
[2:18:41] <%cade_calrayn> she snatched the wig off his bald, round head
[2:18:43] <%Axellogic> I actually do too
[2:18:43] <RubberFistFight> actually better yet
[2:18:44] <RubberFistFight> it was
[2:18:45] <+Inferno_Icon> when you dispel the yokai zone any surviving yokai that were in it have their stamina drained to 0
[2:18:45] <youngking_kush> Agreed
[2:18:46] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> yeah that's be nice
[2:18:46] <GhoulishCripple> yeah the mission based aspect really breaks it
[2:18:46] <%TerpanderLux> is my computer dying or are frames dropping here and there?
[2:18:46] <iamnuff> Same
[2:18:48] <RubberFistFight> P R E D I C T A B O
[2:18:49] <DSD24> I kinda like the missions
[2:18:51] <%valriot> Mission based works best for the type of game it is
[2:18:51] <+Fetrigon> well too bad PunOko
[2:18:54] <かわいい名前> open worlds get tiring after awhile, ill be honest. i like levels
[2:19:00] <artoflec> it is a big explorable area though, i dont really feel like the connective areas in souls ever added much for me.
[2:19:03] <defaultname3887> that would ruin rhe character building and farming
[2:19:06] <GhoulishCripple> makes me hate exploring because it's gone by mission end
[2:19:07] <jetstreamlove_R> That's Granny Tsunades far away cousin Toonade
[2:19:07] <+McSoliace> you'll see more interesting areas soonish
[2:19:09] <+Nomenanza> ye ye ye beat that grandma up
[2:19:11] <%Savarro> True, but it kinda has to be due to the story and jumping around years
[2:19:14] <defaultname3887> nioh 2 is first and foremost action focused
[2:19:14] <DSD24> Plus when you see a really cool new level its nice
[2:19:17] <+skylerpilot> same, get rid of the diablo loot and the mission based level system and I think the game would be much more interesting. Still a fantastic game though
[2:19:19] <+Dova573> I think a good way to describe Niohs issue is like how it is that Obscure anime fighting game with the best mechanics, but is now DBFZ
[2:19:19] <%TerpanderLux> :)
[2:19:19] <%valriot> If it wasnt mission based, the NG+ and general systems would be DOGSHIT
[2:19:22] <artoflec> like i wind up just warping around in souls and it feels like a mission based game, but worse.
[2:19:22] <%PMAvers> I honestly like the missions? Keeps you a bit more focused.
[2:19:23] <+Nomenanza> number go big
[2:19:28] <TallYoda08> LUL
[2:19:29] <%superc37> @patstaresat i see your point but at the same time each mission is just as large as intricate as a single area in dark souls
[2:19:32] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> weren't they talking about nioh 3 potentially being open world?
[2:19:33] <GhoulishCripple> like if the shortcuts remained between plays of the missions it would be less bad
[2:19:33] <defaultname3887> I DO
[2:19:33] <FluorescentLB> LUL LUL
[2:19:34] <+Dova573> But who cares
[2:19:35] <Sonny_Firestorm> Well tough shit, this ain't FromSoft. LUL
[2:19:37] <+alphonseisbest> nah its fine with being level based, if I want to explore I got DKS for that
[2:19:40] <defaultname3887> 500 hours in
[2:19:44] <defaultname3887> i still care
[2:19:47] <%Supwizy> yeah but me want NG+9 SMOrc
[2:19:48] <%valriot> It is like saying "I wish Diablo was Skyrim". it would be shit
[2:19:50] <BarnYardFiddler> Yea we don’t care bub
[2:19:50] <iamnuff> What Magic and Ninjutsu do you have set?
[2:19:52] <+Dova573> I take better level design
[2:19:53] <sennoh> I generally think this game would fall apart without missions
[2:20:00] <+alphonseisbest> when was the last time you play a Diablo game? @PatStaresAt
[2:20:02] <OverlordedK> you have plenty of souls game that aren't level based pat
[2:20:02] <RubberFistFight> er
[2:20:02] <+Inferno_Icon> isnt level based better for streaming/LP tho?
[2:20:08] <%superc37> plus it makes going through areas to look for shit sooo much easier
[2:20:09] <+BoboDaHobo> is this worth buying again on the PS5?
[2:20:10] <RubberFistFight> building your dps primary stat woulda been better
[2:20:16] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> oh yeah, this mini forest
[2:20:17] <yukichocomilk> for me it's the lore just not being interesting at all. I do love the game though
[2:20:20] <+BoboDaHobo> like is the upgrade noticeable from PS4?
[2:20:20] <+MajesticDoogle> i mean you can still explore levels
[2:20:22] <+McSoliace> maybe in nioh 3 in like 5 years
[2:20:26] <+MajesticDoogle> it makes them easier to explore tbh
[2:20:26] <%hax_metatron> Yeah all power to Nioh lovers, I need me that level design crack that FromSoft has. That crack is CLEAN
[2:20:27] <+Nomenanza> technically you could make it work by merging different areas together and using Act based structure like in Diablo 2.
[2:20:28] <ferbeholds> it has its good points you get to fight whatever you like when you want to
[2:20:33] <didgereedoodah> I just wish the levels were better designed. Nioh levels are kinda meh
[2:20:38] <+alphonseisbest> oh neat... why?
[2:20:39] <%Visorak6> How good is diablo 3 these days?
[2:20:40] <Sonny_Firestorm> Ok, I'm at my limit. Any more of Pat's mind goblins and I'll lose my composure. Later everyone.
[2:20:44] <@GeneralSCPatton> Speaking of, Grim Dawn is impeccable
[2:20:45] <%TerpanderLux> true
[2:20:48] <$Order_of_Mystery> damn she got big snitties
[2:20:52] <iamnuff> tiddysnake
[2:20:53] <FluorescentLB> @Sonny_Firestorm lol lmao
[2:20:55] <+Fetrigon> snek woolieGASM
[2:21:01] <RubberFistFight> @BoboDaHobo it runs better, although 120fps mode introduces a bug for some boss battles that despite the claim it's been patched out, has not been, not fully.
[2:21:04] <%XzileGaming> Diablo 3 auction house era. oh man.
[2:21:05] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> What's wrong with it on PC?
[2:21:11] <%cade_calrayn> EMLO
[2:21:14] <%baka_sugoi> psaWink psaWink psaWink psaWink psaWink psaWink
[2:21:15] <+Fetrigon> @order_of_mystery SNITTIES?!! OMEGALUL
[2:21:24] <RubberFistFight> some of the bosses have attack patterns tied to the framerate, and not the actual time
[2:21:33] <%cade_calrayn> snitties and snussy
[2:21:36] <shiny_prinny> i'm fine with Nioh being levels, I like having a game with heavy where I can just get right into the combat
[2:21:37] <studleydoorite> I was going to say look at Elmo's incredible poise then he fell off the couch
[2:21:43] <Mister_McDerp> everybody horny for snitties
[2:21:57] <artoflec> yeah i dont really see the problem with it being missions, a lot of these levels are bigger than souls areas later.
[2:22:00] <@GeneralSCPatton> Cowards in chat undervaluing the snanus sweetc2Gasm
[2:22:05] <DSD24> Snek women
[2:22:06] <RubberFistFight> god i love how their idle animation is just them swinging their tits to and fro
[2:22:07] <+wizard_of_diamonds> I've seen porn of that monster LUL
[2:22:08] <+BoboDaHobo> @rubberfistfight oof. but might still be worth for higher frames in most areas
[2:22:16] <+alphonseisbest> why'd you play D3 8 months ago? just in the mood? @PatStaresAt

[2:22:33] <penitentpendant> No Pat! Pointing it out only makes them hornier!
[2:22:33] <%SaiyanShoto> You can't prove that
[2:22:34] <%cade_calrayn> we're not talking about the snake tits, Pat, we've moved on to snake anus
[2:22:36] <+pectusumbra> @iamnuff BROTHER

[2:22:41] <RubberFistFight> Nure-onna is top-half-lady and bottom-half-snake
[2:22:43] <defaultname3887> just look at the model on the bestiary for a bit Kappa
[2:22:43] <RubberFistFight> that's the lore
[2:22:44] <%cooldude69xx> Its the hist sap you see

[2:23:17] <Mister_McDerp> the term is cloaca
[2:23:21] <%XzileGaming> dont body shame the sneks
[2:23:32] <senfood> Cloussy
[2:23:33] <%epide> THE HORNY MUST WIN
[2:23:35] <%jingokrieg> ***
[2:23:35] <$Order_of_Mystery> you one of those normies what don't like snake ladies, Pat?
[2:23:38] <artoflec> dark souls fanbase has to compare everything to dark souls
[2:23:39] <%cooldude69xx> @Mister_McDerp *Snusst
[2:23:40] <DSD24> This next enemy is a toughie
[2:23:41] <+rafaelba93> its way too different now
[2:23:43] <%TerpanderLux> these motherfuckers...
[2:23:43] <%Blank9> you can just use another weapon pretty easy
[2:23:44] <DSD24> CAW
[2:23:44] <%DianaTheAscian> it's barely a souls like imo
[2:23:46] <%Blank9> I juggled all
[2:23:46] <youngking_kush> There's definitely some Souls DNA here tho
[2:23:49] <%Akizea> god tengu SUCK
[2:23:50] <+SilverDevilfish> This game is Ninja Gaiden + Diablo with a touch of souls
[2:23:50] <%cooldude69xx> @Mister_McDerp damn
[2:23:52] <%XzileGaming> i remember maxstruggling here
[2:23:53] <%hax_metatron> Yea, exactly
[2:23:55] <+JustToWatch> get that Tengussy Pat
[2:23:57] <+Crunchy_the_clown> sonic boom!!
[2:23:59] <didgereedoodah> he was always a guy
[2:24:00] <%Dakuu75> this is a WAY faster paced combat than darksouls
[2:24:00] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> Every game ever made is either a Dark Souls or not a Dark Souls. You can't compare a game to any other game.
[2:24:01] <RubberFistFight> fuckin fuck these tengus and their bullshit
[2:24:04] <%TerpanderLux> :)
[2:24:04] <shiny_prinny> I think it gets compared to DS a lot because that's what people know
[2:24:06] <ytwitchmeng> hahah super killed
[2:24:07] <%XzileGaming> Max struggled here hard
[2:24:07] <%hax_metatron> This is not Souls. Souls is different. FromSoft does different shit.
[2:24:07] <DSD24> Yep
[2:24:07] <%cade_calrayn> YUP
[2:24:09] <Who_lio42> yeah would you call Souls games as Character Action games?
[2:24:10] <+rafaelba93> died twice
[2:24:10] <+Nomenanza> Tengu are absolute bastards sometimes
[2:24:11] <%Hamborgini> I think he got you
[2:24:11] <$Order_of_Mystery> lemme smash
[2:24:11] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> bird wins
[2:24:11] <@GeneralSCPatton> Counter will cancel out of stun
[2:24:11] <%cade_calrayn> that's a Tengu
[2:24:13] <%Axellogic> dont fall off tho
[2:24:16] <+pectusumbra> It's really just the stamina based combat but the speed makes it more like bloodborne I'd say
[2:24:18] <%DashXero> Tengu are always bullshit.
[2:24:21] <+Fetrigon> LUL
[2:24:21] <ytwitchmeng> Tengu is a great yokai
[2:24:24] <RubberFistFight> yeah you will come to HATE the Karasa Tengu
[2:24:28] <かわいい名前> if ocarina of time came out this year people would call it a dark souls copy
[2:24:31] <ytwitchmeng> Maybe favorite joober Yokai
[2:24:33] <$Order_of_Mystery> Bird Up (and then down cause you fell lol)
[2:24:34] <%Dakuu75> SONIC... BOOM~!
[2:24:53] <+Dova573> QUICK USE ZIP
[2:24:54] <+Dova573> ZIIIO
[2:24:57] <RubberFistFight> they have no weaknesses and you can't zone em out over the edge coz they got wings
[2:24:58] <+Dova573> ZIO
[2:25:02] <youngking_kush> Yeah the Tengu are strong man
[2:25:04] <%BirdmanCnC> BirdmanCnC subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months! hope you, peach, and the babies are doing well <3
[2:25:17] <iamnuff> Throwing Revenants off cliffs is great
[2:25:20] <Mister_McDerp> the tengu reminds me of a changer of ways
[2:25:23] <Who_lio42> BYE
[2:25:26] <%Axellogic> @RubberFistFight What are you talking about they can be knocked off like anyone else
[2:25:26] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> another seething dwagon

[2:26:02] <Who_lio42> rocked?
[2:26:02] <%Visorak6> @GhoulishCripple sum it up in one cringe
[2:26:08] <RubberFistFight> @GhoulishCripple how fucking awful was that time-stop CGI in the motorbike garage?
[2:26:11] <%Axellogic> The other direction
[2:26:12] <%Dakuu75> that one ass-hat up there "Wut?... wasn't me..."
[2:26:24] <RubberFistFight> it reminded me of the star trek game bugging out when you get too close to spock and he becomes giant.
[2:26:52] <%XzileGaming> AHA-O
[2:26:53] <%Dakuu75> you can't just break the supports and crash it down, right?
[2:27:01] <%HotSauceFiend> OWned
[2:27:03] <GhoulishCripple> @rubberfistfight the whole movie had me seething in rage when it's "slo-mo" was just 24 fps choppiness
[2:27:04] <+Nomenanza> lol

[2:27:50] <iamnuff> Show him your snake!
[2:27:51] <%SpontaneousC> F
[2:27:54] <%Axellogic> bawk bawk
[2:27:55] <DSD24> Tengu's are the worst
[2:27:58] <%PMAvers> Tengus: Nature's buttholes.
[2:27:58] <RubberFistFight> @GhoulishCripple there is no way in hell that obnoxious-ass motion-blur slowdown stutter "effect" made it past test audiences, which forces me to conclude either they didn't test screen it, or they reserved a huge part of the budget to pay for glowing reviews.
[2:28:02] <johnsmith_746> LUL
[2:28:03] <%Dakuu75> dude, does Pat need to upgrade his weapon? Or is that thing just THAT tanky?
[2:28:03] <%abrupt_abe> Tengu have been a bitch since early in 1
[2:28:09] <shiny_prinny> yeah cliffside is the bigger enemy here
[2:28:12] <+rafaelba93> it is, get gud tho
[2:28:12] <Mister_McDerp> birds and grandmas are surprisingly strong
[2:28:13] <+ReallyBigRocks> tengu are real as fuck
[2:28:15] <@QueequegTheater> Tengu never stop being annoying
[2:28:18] <%blaccbird914> if you have a gun you can snipe him from a distance for huge damage
[2:28:20] <%SpontaneousC> the tengu are a lot tankier than you'd think looking at them
[2:28:28] <FuzzyKey> Glad to see the Tengu's are in the second one (not really)
[2:28:28] <%Savarro> This was the spot where I learned the tengu fight
[2:28:35] <%Areus> Areus subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 42 months! triStare
[2:28:39] <RubberFistFight> @QueequegTheater god at least they don't do wind damage like in 1
[2:28:43] <srv4254> these guy were even worse in nioh 1
[2:28:51] <%XzileGaming> the more you fight this tengu, the worse youll get, its the opposite of everything else in life. mark my words
[2:28:54] <%Dakuu75> "I AM GOLDAR~!"
[2:29:01] <@QueequegTheater> Kappa
[2:29:03] <%Axellogic> Tengu's are pretty predictable once you get used to them
[2:29:05] <knight_verse> Every single fucking Tengu is perched in similar places... fuck 'em all.
[2:29:08] <iamnuff> I just spam bombs on these dudes.
[2:29:09] <+bugz_munny> AH RITA MY QUEEN
[2:29:10] <%abrupt_abe> Yup
[2:29:10] <RubberFistFight> Yeah you become steadily worse fighting these fuckers
[2:29:14] <RubberFistFight> coz of how frustrating they are
[2:29:16] <captainnathaniel> i love when they pull a new moveset
[2:29:23] <RubberFistFight> @bugz_munny make my monster GROOOWWWWW
[2:29:42] <+Crunchy_the_clown> It's still funny seeing Tengu fall off cliffs and just die lol
[2:29:44] <%VentWilsn> crows.... not even once
[2:29:45] <%Axellogic> Tengu's have alot of long startup on their moves so once you get familiar they arent as scary
[2:30:04] <Mister_McDerp> easy mode is now selectable
[2:30:04] <%Savarro> Even after beating the game TWICE when I came back to it 6 months later the tongue still beat my ass
[2:30:04] <+rafaelba93> skip the tengu
[2:30:06] <%HotSauceFiend> why not start popping anima fruits then
[2:30:06] <%Dakuu75> I keep thinking about, how Simmons does a really good Goldar impression. lol
[2:30:11] <RubberFistFight> this guy ruined my fucking day so many times
[2:30:11] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> yeah...yeah
[2:30:15] <RubberFistFight> like this exact specific one
[2:30:22] <%TerpanderLux> yeah i think i just ran past that dude
[2:30:45] <%Agami23> i just threw magic at this dude until he died
[2:30:46] <+McSoliace> yeah this enemy is a wall by itself
[2:30:48] <%XzileGaming> the Tengu's clear time is getting better
[2:30:51] <Dlent_> This guy is a real member of the bird gang
[2:30:54] <%JonathLP> The real Nioh 2 starts here.
[2:30:59] <+rafaelba93> this one is the worst
[2:30:59] <%XzileGaming> this is what i said
[2:30:59] <Mister_McDerp> tilted
[2:31:05] <iamnuff> I beat his ass with ninjutsu
[2:31:07] <artoflec> that how it do sometime
[2:31:09] <knight_verse> Just nuke the Tengu with your DT... its  the only way.
[2:31:10] <%LaughingCatt> that is Nioh
[2:31:14] <%HotSauceFiend> soften him up with arrows then
[2:31:15] <%Visorak6> tengu is always a bitch pat
[2:31:18] <tanarath> Uh huh, surem
[2:31:26] <%valriot> I have 1000s of hours in Nioh1 and 2, these guys are STILL assholes
[2:31:30] <%Agami23> oh, pat has a ninjustsu point
[2:31:32] <labguna> Hey chat, is pat playing on a console or a PC + controller?
[2:31:33] <yukichocomilk> this tengu guy is such a pain in the early levels
[2:31:36] <%VentWilsn> at least the loading is super quick
[2:31:40] <iamnuff> Actually, I beat al the tough enemies with ninjutsu, which is why I never got good
[2:31:40] <@QueequegTheater> this is what we call a certified KEKW moment
[2:31:43] <+bugz_munny> tengu can suck my asshole
[2:31:47] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> pc
[2:31:55] <+Leedle1116> BIRD UP

[2:32:38] <+ReallyBigRocks> :)
[2:32:38] <knight_verse> Sooner or later you are still fighting him.
[2:32:43] <%Axellogic> ITs where that chest is
[2:32:43] <+rafaelba93> cave
[2:32:49] <%Visorak6> I dunno pat you can probably locate him by smell
[2:32:59] <%XzileGaming> he'll follow you for the rest of the game now
[2:33:07] <Zebroneath> Dempsey Roll the old lady
[2:33:08] <Haakeeem> probably filming another movie
[2:33:10] <jetstreamlove_R> ORA ORA ORA ORA
[2:33:11] <+zanz_san> the griffons in the ffzero game have the same move set as the tengu

[2:34:48] <Mister_McDerp> sexy snek cave
[2:34:54] <%Axellogic> This room used to be fucked up on PC and would have massive frame drops if you looked at the candles
[2:35:04] <knight_verse> Don't  worry, you'll see him again soon enough
[2:35:13] <KnivesEve> ooo snek
[2:35:14] <DSD24> Two Snek Ladies
[2:35:15] <iamnuff> snek on snek action
[2:35:15] <amiavamp> @Axellogic oof, like Dragon Age 2 huh
[2:35:25] <%Dakuu75> Does this game have a magic that will silence your footsteps and make it easier to get a sneaky backstab?
[2:35:27] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> the snussy cave
[2:35:36] <amiavamp> @Dakuu75 yes
[2:35:46] <%Axellogic> @Axellogic they ended up fixing it I dont know what they did that caused it
[2:35:56] <jetstreamlove_R> @Dakuu75 YES SIR
[2:36:07] <%Dakuu75> neat~
[2:36:24] <faiz_saad> isnt he stuck on the titty snake since yesterday ? ariW
[2:36:27] <+zanz_san> if you're in a pinch you use lantern fruit or red spider Lillie's to fill your purple gauge.
[2:36:56] <@GeneralSCPatton> Did someone get got by Japanese Pathches?
[2:37:00] <RubberFistFight> yeah and spirit stones to fill your amrita gauge
[2:37:13] <%Puhff> WHO'S TALKING?
[2:37:20] <jetstreamlove_R> ladders been killing npc since the sengoku period
[2:37:22] <%Axellogic> They're so weak yet pat is so scared of the elemental heads
[2:37:26] <iamnuff> Did that enemy just enchant pat's sword?
[2:37:42] <%Dakuu75> I always thought that was a cool enemy. kill the fireball guy and he buffs your weapon with fire.
[2:37:54] <+Nomenanza> don't underestimate elemental heads. They can sometimes stunlock your ass
[2:37:56] <%Dakuu75> Imagine if FFXIV did that with elementals
[2:37:57] <+Crunchy_the_clown> The elemental heads seemed more annoying in Nioh 1
[2:38:02] <iamnuff> I guess it's cooler than just getting lit on fire
[2:38:02] <+Crunchy_the_clown> maybe its just me
[2:38:20] <%Axellogic> snek snek snek

[2:39:59] <RubberFistFight> SHORTCUT SOULS
[2:40:03] <DSD24> One Eyed Oni have big damage
[2:40:03] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> How come I can't say kappa with the face coming up?
[2:40:12] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> Hey it didn't change to the face this time.
[2:40:13] <artoflec> and that feeling is part of why i dont care that its mission based LUL
[2:40:35] <%Axellogic> Splistaff is cool
[2:40:39] <%Blank9> for a mission based game they cram in those shortcuts
[2:40:44] <%Dakuu75> @NigelSchnauzerpug idk, I always click on the emote list and search "kappa" for it
[2:41:05] <%Visorak6> PogChamp
[2:41:07] <%Axellogic> good dodge on that grab pat
[2:41:08] <+Crunchy_the_clown> Nice
[2:41:24] <+Crunchy_the_clown> Doing it
[2:41:24] <DSD24> This man has drop kicks
[2:41:31] <RubberFistFight> @NigelSchnauzerpug the K has to be capitalised
[2:41:33] <artoflec> jumping over the grab was so sick lol
[2:41:36] <RubberFistFight> kappa vs Kappa
[2:41:44] <+Crunchy_the_clown> Still love the one with the elbow drops lol
[2:41:45] <%captain_thickthighs> Yet when I stab all I get is red
[2:41:47] <%Visorak6> feel yourself on that dodge pat that was nuts
[2:41:49] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> I see now.
[2:41:59] <Who_lio42> using yokai attacks to avoid shit is the best
[2:42:03] <%Axellogic> Broomhead pat
[2:42:04] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> It all makes sense, well kinda, I still don't know who he is.
[2:42:10] <%HotSauceFiend> your exp bar on the bottom will turn gold when you can level up
[2:42:12] <DSD24> Its kappa
[2:42:17] <%HotSauceFiend> now you can elvel up

[2:46:31] <%HotSauceFiend> thing i don't like is for nurakabe and mujina's you have to kill them to get their extra flavor text in the hut
[2:46:32] <%Axellogic> I think youve been doing fine
[2:46:32] <RubberFistFight> You're doing about average
[2:46:34] <artoflec> u r pat
[2:46:36] <RubberFistFight> which for this game is pretty good
[2:46:37] <+zanz_san> almost done

[2:46:52] <RubberFistFight> average is a relative term here, dude
[2:46:53] <RubberFistFight> trust me
[2:46:55] <$StrawberryPantsu> Average IS good
[2:46:58] <%HotSauceFiend> you got ninja and onmyo levels to you
[2:47:01] <srv4254> oh its this boss
[2:47:01] <%VentWilsn> hes revealing the orb for us all to witness
[2:47:03] <youngking_kush> Not better than me but good lol
[2:47:06] <%HotSauceFiend> use*
[2:47:09] <RubberFistFight> there's "shit" which is like 10%, "average" which is like the next 85%
[2:47:09] <@GeneralSCPatton> You're doing great
[2:47:15] <+rafaelba93> DUMBO
[2:47:16] <RubberFistFight> and then "good" is the top 4%

[2:47:35] <DSD24> I love that throw
[2:47:38] <%cade_calrayn> Paige, Pat showed us his ass
[2:47:43] <%cade_calrayn> we're all scared
[2:47:49] <DSD24> I love how brutal that throw is
[2:48:04] <%Agami23> oh hey, pat has a magic and ninjutsu point
[2:48:25] <%HotSauceFiend> your character also sits in the hot springs like a woman.
[2:48:31] <%SpontaneousC> I just noticed the elephant noises
[2:48:33] <+zanz_san> wood scaffold shield from lightning
[2:48:34] <+Nomenanza> huh never noticed on TV speakers that there is an elephant cry before the lightning
[2:48:53] <%Axellogic> you can hear an elephant noise just before the lightning shoots
[2:49:09] <artoflec> electrical elephant
[2:49:11] <%SpontaneousC> Time to go fight a lighning elephant I guess
[2:49:15] <+Crunchy_the_clown> LUL LUL
[2:49:15] <Mister_McDerp> japanese electric elephant
[2:49:15] <%SpontaneousC> Hannibal eat your heart out
[2:49:16] <@Ranryu692> what other type of elephant is there?
[2:49:17] <livi242> poor elephant ;(
[2:49:17] <%Hamborgini> Stampy has been juicing
[2:49:19] <RubberFistFight> so usually in fiction, this next boss is portrayed as a fop or a dandy or a completely joke non-threat. In this? He's a fucken badass.
[2:49:20] <Profmcstevie> Dumbos pissed
[2:49:25] <@Ranryu692> wait, is that an Edison joke?
[2:49:28] <slackerunchained> They just MIGHT have a lightning-elephant, pat...
[2:49:34] <studleydoorite> I'm sure it's just a coincidence
[2:49:34] <%HotSauceFiend> have fun
[2:49:35] <+Nomenanza> elephants are known for their conductive properties
[2:49:35] <%Axellogic> you are
[2:49:35] <youngking_kush> @patstaresat If at any point you'd be interested in your character being a perfect recreation of Kazuma Kiryu just say the word
[2:49:35] <iamnuff> Nothing discourages poachers quite like being struck by lightning.
[2:49:35] <JohnA83> New kind of Pikachu
[2:49:46] <@Ranryu692> is this a reference to Edison killing an elephant with electricity?

[2:53:40] <artoflec> the blackened teeth was a sign of nobility i think
[2:53:41] <%JonathLP> Right through the throat
[2:53:41] <%DianaTheAscian> That's thing
[2:53:42] <%Agami23> intimidation, they rubbed coal on their teeth
[2:53:43] <jetstreamlove_R> blitzball brotha, death to all brotha
[2:53:43] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Black Teeth were seen as attractive by old Japanese nobility
[2:53:44] <%jingokrieg> They painted them to hide cavites
[2:53:46] <%LaughingCatt> its a thing nobles did
[2:53:46] <luckyifpurple> People used to put soot on their teeth to cover rot
[2:53:48] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt that was a fashion thing they did, they stained em with charcoal
[2:53:48] <%Mathochism> Teeth blackening was a fancy noble thing in Japan.
[2:53:49] <%Dakuu75> DUDE, THAT IS NOT A QUICK DEATH
[2:53:50] <+zanz_san> black teeth were fashion in imperial court

[2:54:02] <%Deft_Thought> White powder makeup for the face was a thing too

[2:54:13] <+godzookylives> @PatStaresAt which Grinch?
[2:54:15] <RubberFistFight> @Dakuu75 if he put it all the way through and cut his brainstem it'd be immediate
[2:54:15] <DSD24> Look how good Nobu looks
[2:54:16] <TheeRabbi> No, I'm not hurt. He was a bitch.

[2:55:49] <%Blank9> orb cat
[2:55:53] <+Nomenanza> I think they used to sell like BIG plushies of Scrampuss
[2:55:57] <jetstreamlove_R> scampuss are just baby yokais
[2:55:57] <%cade_calrayn> DO NOT BESMIRCH THE SCAMPUS EMLO
[2:55:57] <+zanz_san> nobunaga is gonna his sister's husband soon

[2:56:02] <NordicHorseKing> pat cat
[2:56:03] <%Axellogic> Giant ass ball of fur
[2:56:04] <Make_me_mad> That is basically Zangief as a cat.
[2:56:04] <%Dakuu75> Fucking crack-addict monkey guy
[2:56:07] <TheeRabbi> Why is everyone bowing to Mitsurugi?
[2:56:07] <+TheBitingIrish> The BRI'ISH dub is what kept me from playing Xenoblade Chronicles 2
[2:56:09] <+pectusumbra> contemplate your scrampuss
[2:56:17] <captainnathaniel> she is the last boss from nioh 1
[2:56:17] <%Nope80808> YOu can build to make a shit ton of those cats trail you and they can be pretty effective in combat.
[2:56:23] <%Agami23> she has that tamamano no mae shit
[2:56:26] <Who_lio42> nothign wrong with NINE TAILS.
[2:56:30] <youngking_kush> It's all historical fiction man
[2:56:32] <%HotSauceFiend> the cutscnes get better later
[2:56:33] <+UbiquitousLost> combat is just to good
[2:56:33] <OverlordedK> wow rude
[2:56:33] <+bugz_munny> its so true
[2:56:35] <mrtanaka111> how dare he?
[2:56:35] <+zanz_san> fist missions
[2:56:35] <jetstreamlove_R> scampuss are just dead fetus babies
[2:56:38] <+rafaelba93> I could never give a fuck
[2:56:39] <%Axellogic> They skip all the cool shit in the cutscenes anyway
[2:56:39] <+McSoliace> yeah i only started caring halfway through
[2:56:39] <%valriot> Its just what if Japanese history was JoJo
[2:56:40] <@Ranryu692> that is what happens when Elmo and Zangief do the fusion dance
[2:56:40] <yukichocomilk> the lore in this game is hot garbage
[2:56:42] <+Nomenanza> To be fair the game's story kinda gets into gear at last 20%
[2:56:42] <%zeroarturia> @TheBitingIrish There is JP Dub you can download for free.
[2:56:43] <+skylerpilot> that is correct
[2:56:44] <Mister_McDerp> pet the nine tails
[2:56:44] <artoflec> the cutscenes are so well made and charming
[2:56:44] <%DianaTheAscian> I'm enjoying the sneks
[2:56:44] <youngking_kush> Just read the story of Nobunaga & Hideyoshi
[2:56:44] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> I love the game didn't give a shit about the story
[2:56:45] <DSD24> The plot in this game is fine
[2:56:48] <%TerpanderLux> LOL
[2:56:48] <+Nomenanza> it is right to ignore the shit before
[2:56:49] <+zanz_san> in dojo fist mission
[2:56:50] <@GeneralSCPatton> There is one cool reveal I've encountered so far
[2:56:50] <OverlordedK> it's a fun spin in the feudal stuff
[2:56:50] <+bugz_munny> LUL
[2:56:52] <RubberFistFight> @HotSauceFiend yeah round about the time dark raiden starts showin up.
[2:56:52] <%Visorak6> Like olympians pat?
[2:56:55] <CureMode_> @PatStaresAt tell 900 ppl to log off ff 14 so i can get on
[2:56:56] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @TheBitingIrish the xenoblade dub is incredible to listen to tho
[2:56:56] <+Crunchy_the_clown> 33 1/3 percent chance at best
[2:56:57] <%VentWilsn> so whose got the Ten Tails? Kappa
[2:56:58] <DSD24> I totally get not caring though
[2:57:00] <%Double_Tap_That> LUL
[2:57:00] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> story's not that interesting.
[2:57:00] <SaltyAzteca> CHANCES OF WINNING DRASTIC GO DOWN
[2:57:02] <Mr_Rakjo> Akechi
[2:57:02] <+Kyma1020> These are Monster Hunter quality cutscenes
[2:57:04] <%Puhff> LUL
[2:57:05] <SuspiciousEd> Himself?
[2:57:06] <%TerpanderLux> the numbers dont lie
[2:57:07] <Spagheddies> The Scampuss are fucking powerful. Like, seriously, do not underestimate them. Against yokai, they will make your life super easy.
[2:57:08] <+zanz_san> learn new fist tech
[2:57:09] <%Dakuu75> @CureMode_ lol
[2:57:14] <+zanz_san> in dojo
[2:57:16] <%Vextalyst> Pat I have over 300hrs in Nioh 2 and can confirm Battering Ram Never gets old
[2:57:18] <+sonofrobin73> There's only a couple of interesting things in the story
[2:57:18] <%Agami23> you know what nioh is in my mind? the modern onimusha
[2:57:20] <%Blank9> SENOR JOE?
[2:57:21] <Make_me_mad> That guy who kills him at that temple is HIMSELF
[2:57:24] <+skylerpilot> there is a very large dissonance between how fun the gameplay is and how BORING the story is
[2:57:25] <Profmcstevie> Xenoblade 2 has a JP voice pack whoever said the English put them off
[2:57:26] <+sonofrobin73> and even then its kinda whatever
[2:57:35] <RubberFistFight> @Spagheddies i love how in the dark realm they go all spiky and get seriose face
[2:57:35] <%cade_calrayn> so you tell people that you're a genetic freak and *then* you start playing the video game, Pat?
[2:57:35] <%MidnightBurst12> himself?
[2:57:39] <RubberFistFight> but they're still adorable as shit
[2:57:40] <%hax_metatron> The worst thing about Nioh 2’s cutscenes is that NPC that has the weird tic, jumping around
[2:57:41] <%Deft_Thought> Japan sure does love and or hate Nobunaga
[2:57:47] <%Logoth_> *Samoa Joe
[2:57:52] <ferbeholds> blue is good pat
[2:57:54] <+theoldone001> The GENETIC JACKHAMMER some would say.
[2:58:02] <youngking_kush> The story actually has a few interesting twists if you already know the gist of it from actual History
[2:58:03] <captainnathaniel> @PatStaresAt gonna keep playing this then?
[2:58:05] <+zanz_san> r2 to compare
[2:58:09] <Make_me_mad> @Deft_Thought It's almost like he's a person who had both good and bad qualities.
[2:58:13] <+Nomenanza> Master archer set iirc is for early lightning fists builds
[2:58:19] <Kirbachev> @theoldone001 The DNA DRILL?
[2:58:20] <RubberFistFight> @Deft_Thought i mean, dude was a warlord from a particularly brutal period of the country's history
[2:58:22] <%Axellogic> Its cause the other one had extra toughness in its spoecial effects its not a big deal, Toughness works like equip weight in that its the color that matters most
[2:58:24] <Kghaleon> Nightmare alley wasn't anything like they advertised at the game awards...lol
[2:58:25] <%Nope80808> This game really unlocks at ng+ its kinda weird.
[2:58:35] <%Deft_Thought> @Make_me_mad Impossible. There can only be one narrative.
[2:58:37] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> YEAH
[2:58:38] <youngking_kush> It caps
[2:58:40] <%valriot> so 2 more times
[2:58:48] <Zombrocom> Yeah, kinda the problem with nioh 2s story is that you need to know japanese history for it to make any goddamn sense
[2:58:57] <%TerpanderLux> i died
[2:59:06] <@Ranryu692> I fell out of bed
[2:59:08] <%SaiyanShoto> Can I sue?
[2:59:08] <%DianaTheAscian> My legs are gone
[2:59:09] <%Axellogic> Go toward the life skills
[2:59:10] <youngking_kush> @zombrocom That's exactly it
[2:59:13] <%Axellogic> life helps alot
[2:59:15] <%cade_calrayn> giefquake category 5
[2:59:19] <OverlordedK> just work towards holding more arrows
[2:59:19] <+zanz_san> bow damage
[2:59:21] <+Crunchy_the_clown> look for one that you want to unlock later and work towards that
[2:59:23] <%TerpanderLux> SANTA NOO
[2:59:25] <+Nomenanza> damage boosting skills are great because you can force the scaling on some skills by using them
[2:59:26] <Who_lio42> just aim for the stats ones
[2:59:28] <%Deft_Thought> @Deft_Thought Yeah, it's a complicated chunk of history to reconcile with. Seeing how frequently his character oscillates in depictions across media is just fascinating to me.
[2:59:30] <%TerpanderLux> hes KILLING SANTA
[2:59:33] <Who_lio42> or elemental ones
[2:59:39] <%cade_calrayn> WHERE'S YOUR CHRISTMAS SPIRIT, ZANGIEF?!
[2:59:49] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> @Zombrocom i think the problem is that they failed at the historical and fantasy part
[3:00:15] <Make_me_mad> The skills that increase damage for active skills can be applied in the skill customization menu. You can equip or unequip them from different skills as you want.
[3:00:19] <%TerpanderLux> good talk
[3:00:34] <%TerpanderLux> no
[3:00:44] <slackerunchained> Paige is not 'Most Humans'...
[3:00:46] <%MidnightBurst12> microsleeps
[3:00:46] <+McSoliace> i guess im always tred
[3:00:47] <%IamGrapes> i feel that
[3:00:51] <TheeRabbi> LOl the irony of trying to use a treat to reinforce calm in a dog, after they were not calm.
[3:00:57] <Profmcstevie> Force the eyeballs open but the eyelids twinge for relaxation
[3:00:59] <+Nomenanza> @JustTheGuyYouNeed the mythical part is a bit interesting just due to its time scale alone, but the warring states period is so overdone it becomes boring
[3:01:19] <%CalderGaming> he's racist against fake italians oh no
[3:01:20] <Profmcstevie> NO ITALIAN GESTURES
[3:01:24] <Profmcstevie> Dog hate
[3:01:30] <%cade_calrayn> Zangief's from the town in Footloose, he doesn't like dancing

[3:02:07] <OverlordedK> poison coating is OP

[3:02:12] <%Blank9> just get passives then
[3:02:13] <Kghaleon> Except Ninjutsu is the most OP thing in the game, mainly the featers

[3:03:18] <%cade_calrayn> pat it literally says Medicine right there
[3:03:18] <%Visorak6> Its so people can tell you
[3:03:18] <RubberFistFight> you already got told by like 5 fucken people
[3:03:19] <luckyifpurple> look for it
[3:03:19] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> @Nomenanza I just kinda wished they did more with the mythical instead of what we get, at least the DLCs are better
[3:03:20] <Kirbachev> The big bomb is fucking comical, like it's literally a cartoon big black ball
[3:03:23] <+zanz_san> quick change is second chance
[3:03:23] <Spagheddies> That was VERY rude.
[3:03:23] <shiny_prinny> fuck it just grab more bombs
[3:03:28] <@GeneralSCPatton> Power Pill kicks ass

[3:03:39] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[3:03:39] <%Blank9> there's a good chance shuriken 1 isn't elixir
[3:03:42] <@QueequegTheater> IT LITERALLY SAYS MEDICINE
[3:03:43] <RubberFistFight> Fuckin seek and peck then if it suits you, jesus christ.
[3:03:46] <%HotSauceFiend> if you aren't investing in ninja points, then the only real things of use here are the power pills and maybe groundfire traps
[3:03:46] <+kungfauxboi> ew
[3:03:52] <Kghaleon> Lightning, water and fire feathers kill bosses.
[3:03:58] <slackerunchained> This is starting to turn into that adult-baby scene from yakuza...
[3:03:59] <TheeRabbi> Paige Diaper Fetish Confirmed.
[3:03:59] <%SaiyanShoto> You're too smelly to hug him
[3:03:59] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> Too bad Pat can't read
[3:04:01] <+Local16> The elemental ninjutsu are the best stuff imo
[3:04:01] <+kungfauxboi> Is this their kink?
[3:04:02] <+Nomenanza> @JustTheGuyYouNeed yup, anything outside the Hideyoshi and Nobunaga storyline is way more interesting
[3:04:02] <%baka_sugoi> Your STINKY pat
[3:04:02] <%abrupt_abe> When I'd quick change unlocked again anyway
[3:04:04] <%cvp5127> cause your stinky pat

[3:04:13] <youngking_kush> The Ninja Tree elemental attacks are better than the Onmyo ones
[3:04:14] <RubberFistFight> @QueequegTheater "nuh BuT it'S toO HarD tHo duMbAss"
[3:04:14] <%Axellogic> Quick Change is a free death
[3:04:14] <%Nope80808> @PatStaresAt  This is a game that encourages multiple respecs. It will click with you before you finish.
[3:04:14] <+Ironbuttz> my boy also does not desire the hugs
[3:04:19] <%valriot> Feathers, Power Pills and Quick Change are the real deal. Also explosive arrows
[3:04:23] <artoflec> LUL
[3:04:27] <+Deasmeister> Blinding shells are real good they turn off enemy tracking for attacks
[3:04:31] <Kghaleon> All the fast speedrunners go Ninjutsu, so thats all that needs to be said.
[3:04:32] <%captain_thickthighs> No matter as insulting as pat gets ill still have my foot and 2 inchd
[3:04:34] <%Blank9> quick change is second chance from demon's souls
[3:04:36] <@QueequegTheater> Pat just get the medicines
[3:04:41] <youngking_kush> All the Onmyo elemental attacks suck
[3:04:42] <+Nomenanza> to be fair you'll get so many skill points in the game you will max out both samurai and ninja trees whether you want it or not
[3:04:42] <%Agami23> dark realm resistence could be useful
[3:04:44] <Who_lio42> blinding shells are real strong too
[3:04:45] <%Axellogic> More barrier :V
[3:04:47] <+rafaelba93> elemental talismans?
[3:04:53] <+Inferno_Icon> go all barrier upgrades
[3:04:55] <@QueequegTheater> Unironically pump barrier
[3:04:57] <Who_lio42> barrier, regen, oasis
[3:05:01] <RubberFistFight> @QueequegTheater nah let him fuck his build up, he deserves it
[3:05:02] <%Blank9> water shot cool
[3:05:02] <%Monkeyweed21> Ninjutsu is absurdly good lol
[3:05:02] <@Ranryu692> do you think they'll call the third game Threeoh?
[3:05:04] <%cade_calrayn> Get the Talismans and then the Resistance ones, and Barrier
[3:05:11] <youngking_kush> Barrier, Regen, Steel, Oasis
[3:05:12] <+zanz_san> barrier
[3:05:13] <%cade_calrayn> boooooo
[3:05:15] <OverlordedK> onmyo has a million good skills
[3:05:16] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Pump barrier
[3:05:17] <%cade_calrayn> booooooooooooooooo
[3:05:26] <かわいい名前> extraction bis
[3:05:29] <@QueequegTheater> Barriest
[3:05:30] <%abrupt_abe> Asset reuse is at yakuza level
[3:05:38] <captainnathaniel> do the story stuff then
[3:05:42] <defaultname3887> stop doing optional you dingus
[3:05:43] <Profmcstevie> I hope it has SPIDERS now
[3:05:45] <@QueequegTheater> NO IT'S A DIFFERENT FOREST SHUT UP IT''S FINE
[3:05:52] <%cade_calrayn> damn the lack of dog hugs has made Pat extra salty tonight
[3:05:54] <+Nomenanza> at least they mix it up with some barriers to make progression a bit different
[3:05:59] <@GeneralSCPatton> Forest Remix
[3:06:07] <youngking_kush> Yeah, optionals always are remixes
[3:06:08] <ferbeholds> its the same forest

[3:08:07] <%SolumFuturae> looks like hemwick
[3:08:17] <%cade_calrayn> I don't remember these guys from last time, so it's clearly very different
[3:08:28] <@GeneralSCPatton> It's like the Ship of Theseus. Is it the same forest if you move around the vine walls?
[3:08:33] <%cvp5127> nobuhimbo
[3:08:33] <Afterman_> NEVA
[3:08:34] <%cade_calrayn> Where's the big crystal tree? See? Not the same forest
[3:08:37] <かわいい名前> i thought we wanted an open world so we could double back a bunch, well here we go :)
[3:08:50] <Zombrocom> It's very clearly a different forest that looks exactly the same and has the exacly the same layout
[3:08:51] <%TerpanderLux> :)
[3:08:52] <%Axellogic> I am ready for the ninja gank squad
[3:08:56] <RubberFistFight> nah, different forest
[3:09:13] <Profmcstevie> Then you better not get lost then barbSip
[3:09:15] <slackerunchained> "Mom? Can we get a forest stage setting?" / "We have forest stage settings at home..."
[3:09:20] <+Nomenanza> "bro can I copy your forest?" "sure just changes some bits so that it's not obvious"
[3:09:24] <Spagheddies> It absolutely is the same forest, and I'm not sure why you'd expect it to be otherwise.
[3:09:24] <%HotSauceFiend> these ninjas can destroy you with their red attack
[3:09:31] <RubberFistFight> h u b r i s
[3:09:38] <Zombrocom> His brother, i think

[3:10:46] <%notsoy> jesus christ that's a lot of grasves
[3:10:46] <%cade_calrayn> Next level will include tall shelves, then he'll *really* be upset

[3:11:13] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> LUL

[3:13:30] <Kghaleon> Thank god for precious Reggie who suffers repeatedly for our entertainment every week
[3:13:32] <%justcallmebobplease> HAT V HAT, HAT WINS
[3:13:32] <GilliamYaeger> This is why you skip most of the side missions
[3:13:32] <%hax_metatron> No joke, I get hype after every main mission, and every SINGLE SUB MISSION absolutely sucks the life out of
[3:13:33] <TheeRabbi> Why does Paige instantly respond when you say "dumb bitch?"
[3:13:34] <%Axellogic> Odachi NPCS hit really hard
[3:13:36] <かわいい名前> game too hard, playthrough over boys FeelsBadMan
[3:13:38] <artoflec> the side missions are considerably harder than the main ones yeah
[3:13:38] <%ForneusAtSeaWorld> cable not spaghetti paige
[3:13:41] <%HotSauceFiend> ROUND 2
[3:13:56] <%CalderGaming> anyone else getting a lot of frame drops?
[3:14:02] <RubberFistFight> Yeah you're essentially putting his spirit down for good or some shit
[3:14:03] <slackerunchained> @RubberFistFight It's electrolytes. i bleed electrolytes..."
[3:14:05] <%Axellogic> No its just the same guy you skipped his weapon change
[3:14:07] <%valriot> Its so you can farm his boss skills easier
[3:14:09] <rReizs> nah its the same, he weapon switchs
[3:14:11] <youngking_kush> It's a optional mission Pat, this is the run back
[3:14:13] <@GeneralSCPatton> Ghost rematch for fast grind
[3:14:14] <%ForneusAtSeaWorld> no exactly the same
[3:14:19] <Zombrocom> So here is your rematch/farming mission for this boss
[3:14:20] <%hax_metatron> LUL
[3:14:21] <%RealThiele> its almost like story is important to interest
[3:14:25] <@QueequegTheater> Same forest, same guy, is there anything you won't make up Kapp
[3:14:34] <%captain_thickthighs> C'mon demon elphwnt form
[3:14:37] <%hax_metatron> Get clowned on again idiot
[3:14:40] <+PkSilent01> @PatStaresAt I get the feel too, this week I just got in Shadowbringers but I lose all motivation because I just did post Stormblood MSQ for two days straight.
[3:14:44] <Make_me_mad> A lot of the side missions are "Rematch this boss without having to do a long story level beforehand"
[3:14:46] <%KnifeyMcEdge> Now you must defeat Living romm Hippo!
[3:14:51] <Kghaleon> Is this the ghost version of this dude?
[3:14:53] <+PkSilent01> lost motivation*
[3:14:59] <%HotSauceFiend> the only threatening thiungh this guy has is that lightening stun effect
[3:15:12] <sirrice77> @Kghaleon Yes, technically
[3:15:27] <%Visorak6> SourPls
[3:15:54] <%HotSauceFiend> and now the yokai kusarigama text
[3:16:00] <TheeRabbi> Can MMO players even use "it's just the same guy but different X" as a valid complaint?
[3:16:03] <slackerunchained> @Kghaleon Man. Japan has some pretty darn solid ghosts... No wonder Woolie didn't spot any on his trip there. They must look just like regular people...
[3:16:03] <rReizs> easier to farm from the side missions since its a shorter run
[3:16:18] <ammobasket> good run
[3:16:21] <%Visorak6> You're just burnt out for tonight?
[3:16:27] <%cvp5127> so more ff14 tomorrow?
[3:16:28] <%hax_metatron> I dunno. You can use it as a valid complaint if it bothers you ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[3:16:30] <Mister_McDerp> he HATES nioh 2 now jermaPluto
[3:16:35] <RubberFistFight> Pat taking the bait question seriously Kappa
[3:16:40] <%Blank9> WILD FREAKS
[3:16:48] <%valriot> Ok but that did happen
[3:16:49] <Spagheddies> Same guy = 0/10
[3:16:55] <%RealThiele> WHAT IS A MAN
[3:16:59] <%TerpanderLux> ye
[3:17:03] <%Visorak6> no not really
[3:17:03] <%TerpanderLux> you had your fun
[3:17:04] <+PkSilent01> yes
[3:17:05] <かわいい名前> side missions will do that
[3:17:05] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> Burn out
[3:17:05] <youngking_kush> I guess
[3:17:06] <shiny_prinny> yeah it's cool
[3:17:06] <+ReallyBigRocks> Yeah thats how the game go
[3:17:07] <studleydoorite> he hates us now jermaPluto
[3:17:07] <%valriot> Theres a fight thats literally just T12
[3:17:08] <ammobasket> yeah makes sense
[3:17:08] <%MidnightBurst12> you are sated
[3:17:08] <Zombrocom> Not really, but you do you
[3:17:08] <@Ranryu692> that happened to me with Bloodborne
[3:17:09] <%Treuan> Sure,w e've all been there
[3:17:09] <+sonofrobin73> Yes, happens to me all the time
[3:17:12] <slackerunchained> A miserable pile of Salt.
[3:17:15] <%KnifeyMcEdge> Yep. i feel that way about Ghost of Tsushima right now
[3:17:15] <$SGrim> @PatStaresAt you feel done?
[3:17:18] <+ReallyBigRocks> especially with the side missions
[3:17:24] <tegas_> Yeah the side missions are super whatever but the mechanics are so good I could hardly care.
[3:17:24] <%DianaTheAscian> @patstaresat thats just burn out
[3:17:26] <KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt Are you "satiated" with it?
[3:17:29] <%MugenSandan> Pat is unlocking easy mode within himself Kappa
[3:17:30] <shiny_prinny> gottem
[3:17:30] <%hax_metatron> Also, he can like some things but not others. Chill guys. Clearly he likes the combat of Nioh 2.
[3:17:31] <%KnifeyMcEdge> Coke can
[3:17:32] <%chance_h> It’s a long game with less diversity
[3:17:33] <artoflec> im so glad it isnt one big connected world HahaSweat
[3:17:34] <+sonofrobin73> This game is fun right up until it makes you miserable for a few minutes. then you put it down for the day
[3:17:35] <+Kyma1020> Tbh I got nervous at the mention of the third boss and enjoyed the fake out
[3:17:35] <%Deft_Thought> Confirmed, Pat is a penis
[3:17:36] <@GeneralSCPatton> Some of this stuff does feel like what the Warriors games do. Just remix the content for optional levels. It's efficient content creation.
[3:17:37] <b_ikki> open stream, first word "penis"
[3:17:42] <%Agami23> one of the new ff14 dungeons had me feeling that "this is weird that its just the enemy from that other thing but different colors"
[3:17:44] <Profmcstevie> Too much side mission, level designs not killing it, combat encounters have been less engaging. It happens PrideShrug
[3:17:47] <%OrangeMDT> One day Pat will finish a game
[3:17:47] <%captain_thickthighs> A chord you mean
[3:17:47] <Kghaleon> here we go
[3:17:48] <%Nope80808> f

[3:17:55] <jorniev> i liked
[3:17:59] <Mister_McDerp> rip nioh 2
[3:18:00] <slackerunchained> Disaronno On Red.
[3:18:02] <@Lion_kun> I thought you were enjoying it.
[3:18:04] <%DEETRz> that doesnt count
[3:18:06] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt use different weapons if it starts to feel stale
[3:18:06] <tegas_> Pat the unfinisher
[3:18:07] <Kghaleon> Reggie will beat all the Nioh games before Pat
[3:18:07] <jorniev> ITS AN MMO
[3:18:08] <%MidnightBurst12> don't count
[3:18:11] <+Prism_Zet> quittin?
[3:18:12] <%KnifeyMcEdge> a normal game hehehe
[3:18:14] <big_oki> dishonor
