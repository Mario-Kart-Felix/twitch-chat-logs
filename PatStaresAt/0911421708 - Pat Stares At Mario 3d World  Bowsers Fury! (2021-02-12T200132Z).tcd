[0:22:42] <yourliteraldog> Then they ran a train on pat
[0:22:42] <%Ganerumo> There's a lot of volunteer firefighters who do nothing for years and then claim to be firefighters they're literal poseurs
[0:22:43] <%Dingalow> Yes, Pat, you """"accidentally"""" showed these firemen your penis
[0:22:43] <%cowardman93> there is no part of a fireman's job that is negative to people
[0:22:45] <%sumrand0> Firemen are hotter than fire that's why they can run into burning buildings FACT
[0:22:46] <BlkFlameKami> "daddy shit"
[0:22:48] <+waltzqueen> @lucas18293 you're 1000% correct

[0:23:04] <+HyperCharge_Sam> All the good people who should be cops become firemen
[0:23:07] <$SGrim> @chosenjuan42 unless they're the arsonist firefighters.
[0:23:07] <+waltzqueen> @Monkeyweed21 Pls do
[0:23:08] <karl_rex> Thats why there are some cops that hate firemen and why nypd refused to work with New York Fire Department
[0:23:09] <DianaTheAscian> yeah
[0:23:10] <%maenos2> so what you're saying pat is to set fires to meet attractive people got jt

[0:23:28] <%full_circle> Cheer500 lol I don't know how I would've survived the day without hearing Paige say, "If I passed out from shitting you know I'd brag about it"
[0:23:29] <%sumrand0> eh everyone dies eventually at least they get badass non choke jerk deaths
[0:23:31] <%walternatorz> firefighting, lumberjacks, and pizza delivery
[0:23:33] <%kylejefferies> Yakuza 8 should have a firefighter class/companion

[0:25:02] <%OctaivianRex> I think you fight rats in that game.

[0:25:17] <@SoFarFetched> they should still be fine if you played 2
[0:25:18] <%Monkeyweed21> People vastly overestimate how often buildings burn down, being a fireman is mostly about sitting around, doing controlled burns, and dealing with jackasses pulling fire alarms or fucking up their BBQ @PatStaresAt
[0:25:18] <+chosenjuan42> Haha the cat went for your mouse
[0:25:19] <+MooseIsGoose> ignore progression

[0:25:28] <%Undenizen> EHHH. just get carried for a few missions by your huge friends
[0:25:29] <%AEUG_Ace_Kamille> You're generally fine, just maybe drop a level down to get a feel.
[0:25:32] <%sumrand0> cant make a new account or delete save files?
[0:25:33] <%Undenizen> you'll level up real fast
[0:25:36] <plesingr007> you kill rats, end
[0:25:38] <%toolofparanoia> y hes mad?
[0:25:38] <%Piemono> You should be fine
[0:25:42] <%whyskeywolfe> There's nothing major that you haven't seen before, and it's not like you'll be locked out of levels.
[0:25:42] <%kylejefferies> Also progression is fairly linear and not hard to fix at all.
[0:25:43] <rawrmeowxd> @VirtuaRailith lies
[0:25:49] <%kylejefferies> most important thing is gear

[0:32:10] <islandsunn> Alimony not same thing
[0:32:12] <%NenaFan101> Yeah, cats don't like it when you wipe their butts with paper towels, but sometimes you got to
[0:32:13] <NeroInfinite> Poop basically
[0:32:13] <%sumrand0> PAY UP
[0:32:15] <VoraciousKain> but what if, that child should pay him?
[0:32:19] <%toolofparanoia> Raise yo kidz
[0:32:21] <%cowardman93> just pay the money you owe
[0:32:25] <+gimmickypizza> It's a form of child support
[0:32:27] <islandsunn> Doctor Doofenshmirtz lived off alimony
[0:32:29] <%sumrand0> Kids cost a lot
[0:32:30] <%Tomfom25> started Catherine: full body did u ever finish it Pat?
[0:32:31] <Darren716> no
[0:32:33] <%cylish> if hes in american its very possible his alimony payments are bs
[0:32:36] <+BrogorkTheFork> I'm sure it's been asked but where do I get that shirt?
[0:32:37] <rosemon5001> is it tim to furry it all up? @PatStaresAt
[0:32:37] <Kashi_Nin> Hello again!
[0:32:38] <+Pendlez> fuck that my husband doesn't deserve shit
[0:32:39] <%THATGUY_789> @nenafan101 truth
[0:32:39] <%X2Eliah> alimony is a lemony drink
[0:32:42] <%sumrand0> super scum
[0:32:45] <VoraciousKain> kids do cost a lot
[0:32:48] <rytisone> Vergil
[0:32:49] <+ApocalypticExpress> ur right my dad is a scumbag
[0:32:50] <yourliteraldog> It's not my fault I hate condoms
[0:32:51] <Kashi_Nin> time for a maeryo?
[0:32:55] <rawrmeowxd> LUL FACTS
[0:32:58] <GustauveVIII> the question is does child support help the child or the adult?
[0:32:58] <+OwlLightningMage> Vergil
[0:33:00] <+Ellila> What if the baby was giving out bad vibes?
[0:33:01] <%sumrand0> Youd don't know that
[0:33:01] <%UvBenServed> LUL
[0:33:02] <+mikesapartment> I dunno. When your kid is stolen from you cus the lawyer lied it can make child support feel unfair
[0:33:02] <%JoshManVGH> My dad tried to get out of it and got a lean on his house.
[0:33:02] <+paladinstarbuster> alimony should only be for specific cases
[0:33:03] <%Undenizen> Don't have children.
[0:33:05] <+Pendlez> he didn't snitch either
[0:33:08] <+ApocalypticExpress> he cheated AND he didn't pay child support all our lives
[0:33:08] <VoraciousKain> also I thought it was doofenschmirtz that had to pay his ex
[0:33:08] <%CzeekyPlays> Parental court is pretty fucked up tho
[0:33:08] <NeroInfinite> Alimony is shit don't need to pay that but child support? Yeah.
[0:33:08] <%Squdnate> btw. I got the sub pop up and didnt know what to write, so i just wrote some shit. Love ya Pat <3
[0:33:09] <Aji__> turn on the stream " the baby didnt cheat on you"
[0:33:09] <%sumrand0> lol
[0:33:09] <%OctaivianRex> Pat, haven't you encouraged people to pump and dump before?
[0:33:10] <Zeif00> So are people who abandon their kids to make a new family with kids
[0:33:10] <+OwlLightningMage> Vergil is maximum scum
[0:33:10] <%kylejefferies> What if its not their kid?
[0:33:17] <Broken_Sonex> Don’t have kids
[0:33:19] <%ssjklyco> Who says onlyy the husband cheats?
[0:33:23] <JanusII> No money for that baby if it likes their new dad more.
[0:33:25] <skyentombment> SPILL THE PAINT
[0:33:28] <Kashi_Nin> lol oh
[0:33:28] <rosemon5001> yea but it usually the cheating party demanding outrageous numbers
[0:33:29] <%depressed_skeleton> you just gotta fake that orgasm, right pat?
[0:33:31] <lloyddboy> PUMP AND DUMP FOR GLORY
[0:33:32] <%Gogogolem> It will be a cold day in hell before i take responsibility for where my yogurt thrower happend to land.
[0:33:33] <+BrogorkTheFork> Vergil didn't pay child support. be like Vergil.
[0:33:33] <+gimmickypizza> Pump and dump
[0:33:34] <%toolofparanoia> kids can get their revenge and stick their deadbeat parents in a home when they old
[0:33:35] <%Piemono> My child cheated on me an got another Father Figure
[0:33:35] <%dd44dostivei> technically the baby was in your lady
[0:33:36] <%sumrand0> Get her preggers yknow for the lulz
[0:33:36] <%OctaivianRex> But Pat I based my life on that advice.
[0:33:37] <LordOfThePoultry> for fun?
[0:33:38] <%Agami23> man, i was just thinking about how i celebrated my dad getting a divorce by sending his ex wife some cookies.
[0:33:38] <BlkFlameKami> but it's fun to do bad things
[0:33:39] <%garagon31> If she gets to choose to have it or not, I should be able to choose to pay for it or not.
[0:33:39] <@SoFarFetched> So there's ....the truth......and THE TRUTH
[0:33:40] <%Undenizen> It's ok if it's just a prank, bro
[0:33:40] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> yehehehehe

[0:33:59] <rawrmeowxd> wanna get PUMP and DUMP tatted on my knuckles now
[0:33:59] <%X2Eliah> It's wild how many people don't realize the diff between "haha be a bad person j/k" and actually being a bad person
[0:34:01] <%RD_nx> you can be a bad boy or bad bitch without being a "bad person"
[0:34:02] <%depressed_skeleton> only a lil bit
[0:34:03] <NeroInfinite> There's a big difference.
[0:34:03] <%NenaFan101> My mother didn't want child support, she just wanted custody of us.
[0:34:03] <orpleborple> edgeybZhouface
[0:34:04] <Kashi_Nin> oh god. Bebé does not wish me to watch Pat stream!
[0:34:05] <%kylejefferies> Womb litter

[0:34:08] <xeros720> a level of intensity, but it's still bad
[0:34:11] <yourliteraldog> No your liter inside in your gf
[0:34:13] <LordOfThePoultry> is there really?
[0:34:14] <nivlac_555> what did i walk into?
[0:34:14] <Maleicus> not really
[0:34:15] <%garagon31> garagon31 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months! If she can choose to have it or not I should be able to choose to pay for it or not.
[0:34:15] <dragon17013> same exact thing
[0:34:16] <%Vanslainstreams> Littering is a gate way crime
[0:34:17] <%OctaivianRex> It
[0:34:17] <%Undenizen> One human is a MUCH worse environmental crime than an aluminum can.
[0:34:18] <%sumrand0> Littering < Paying child support SLIGHT DIFFERENCE
[0:34:20] <+gimmickypizza> Pumping and littering is the same thing
[0:34:20] <%cowardman93> there's a slight difference on the scales
[0:34:21] <OldManDeckardCain> MOTHER EARTH WILL REMEMBER THIS
[0:34:21] <+OwlLightningMage> They're worth the same dark side points
[0:34:22] <plesingr007> both are bad
[0:34:22] <%Foxcade> Pat goes hard on the "No one would reasonable believe what he says is true" mentality to content creation
[0:34:22] <+BrogorkTheFork> no your destroying the future generation either way. all evil is equal
[0:34:23] <%UvBenServed> DNA littering
[0:34:23] <%kylejefferies> Making that child is womb litter
[0:34:24] <%AEUG_Ace_Kamille> I hate the term womb litter.
[0:34:24] <+tigerfang86> BRUH
[0:34:25] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> what does your shirt say
[0:34:25] <@SoFarFetched> would pump and dump be considered a form of "littering"? geefThink
[0:34:26] <%sumrand0> Fair
[0:34:26] <+tigerfang86> b r u h
[0:34:26] <%Ranryu692> yeah, there is. littering hurts EVERYONE
[0:34:26] <bob900000> LUL

[0:34:29] <%Ganerumo> But pat you're saying it's bad to dodge child support while wearing a tee shirt depicting the absolute king of dodging child support
[0:34:30] <Aji__> Semen litter
[0:34:31] <LordOfThePoultry> LUL
[0:34:31] <%ssjklyco> Throwing a can on the floor is not much of a financial burden as leaving someone with a kid to raise

[0:34:39] <+gimmickypizza> DNA litter
[0:34:40] <pavramz> pat really doesnt want to laugh
[0:34:41] <%thbluewarden> next bit?
[0:34:42] <xeros720> littering is one dark side point, pump and dump is at least 15
[0:34:42] <Broken_Sonex> Your throwing away trash either way
[0:34:44] <pavramz> but that good him
[0:34:45] <+OwlLightningMage> Children are garbage

[0:35:36] <%Undenizen> if you're going to search "Bowser's furry" I advise against it
[0:35:37] <Saltmeisterr> :O
[0:35:37] <Mattais88> Disco tartarus?
[0:35:37] <yourliteraldog> Bowsette is canon
[0:35:39] <FoxInABeret> @TurtlesAndTentacles Yep
[0:35:41] <bob900000> really?
[0:35:42] <+paladinstarbuster> Big Black Bowsette
[0:35:42] <%KineticZen> I like that title too
[0:35:42] <VoraciousKain> did we just start? we haven't even begun to begin
[0:35:43] <%sumrand0> Wot?
[0:35:47] <%ssjklyco> Thoguht it was Make Peace with the Furries
[0:35:47] <+Caidezes> Wow.
[0:35:47] <Kashi_Nin> That is a fantastic name
[0:35:48] <+smuggleruncle> that's terrible
[0:35:51] <%X2Eliah> .... that was not a good name
[0:35:52] <$SGrim> ALWAYS WAR ON THE FURRIES!
[0:35:52] <For_Temeria> No Truce with the Furries
[0:35:53] <+gimmickypizza> Furries
[0:35:54] <%Pyr0_Fr0st> @PatStaresAt You litterally have a shirt of the ultimate child support dodger on
[0:35:55] <%cowardman93> Disco Elysium is a better title
[0:35:57] <%JumboCrunchies> Ooh Mario Furry Game time

[0:36:12] <+gimmickypizza> No truce
[0:36:13] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> no mercy
[0:36:15] <%AEUG_Ace_Kamille> @PatStaresAt are you considering going back to to Disco Elysium with it getting voice acting?
[0:36:15] <%rawrmeowxd> That's the game I really want LUL
[0:36:16] <%saiyanblitz> @pyr0_fr0st he didn’t know he had a kid
[0:36:17] <%asgard147> That's a hell of a game title
[0:36:17] <%X2Eliah> It SHOULD have been called "No truce with the Furries"
[0:36:18] <+AlchemiBeast> We Do Not Negotiate With Furries
[0:36:19] <TheMoenia> Disco Elysium is a way better name anyway
[0:36:21] <SomersaultJustice> plague declared war criminal
[0:36:23] <xeros720> yeah, that seems counter intuitive
[0:36:23] <+OwlLightningMage> IS IT
[0:36:25] <yourliteraldog> Every Thing Changed when the furry nation attacked
[0:36:27] <+swamp_roo> no truce with the furries, only war
[0:36:28] <jeffishype> im playing that game in real life right now
[0:36:29] <+Pendlez> back in the furry wars
[0:36:31] <%MisterRockett> Fatal Furies had the EXACT SAME PROBLEM and is considered one of the reasons that game sold poorly.

[0:37:42] <%AEUG_Ace_Kamille> WE, THE PEOPLE OF REVACHOL, LOOK FORWARD TO THIS STREAM!
[0:37:43] <%ssjklyco> I can;t wait to get back to it as I played it for almost a whole night and enjoyed it
[0:37:44] <%brickwall35> apparently it has 4x the amount of dialogue compared to Hades
[0:37:46] <Manwad> mime stream
[0:37:48] <+gimmickypizza> No talkies
[0:37:48] <OldManDeckardCain> so a huge improvement?
[0:37:48] <Zebroneath> You can't win
[0:37:48] <%sumrand0> I hope the VA is terrible, I wanna hear some awkward racist dialogue where the NPC claims to not know tha "Pacifics"
[0:37:48] <+Vikbosss> Русские есть кто смотрит Пэта?

[0:37:52] <%X2Eliah> Sounds like a good game to stream and not so good to play
[0:37:52] <%asgard147> That's okay
[0:37:52] <%KineticZen> They're some sorta Communist collective over there at ZA/UM that's how the afforded it Kappa
[0:38:04] <%cowardman93> oh my god that poor VA's throat! I hope he's rolling in money bux
[0:38:07] <+twohitgood> the narrator isn't your ego?
[0:38:09] <%bevyrage> wait is it reptile brain?
[0:38:12] <gothicdoubling> they said the hours of dialogue the narrator has is longer than War and Peace
[0:38:13] <%RD_nx> so even the description of how the sparkle of broken glass reflects gently off of the sticky sickly liquor pooled on the floor will be voiced?
[0:38:14] <+twohitgood> oh yeah, that's your ego
[0:38:14] <%X2Eliah> Jesus Paige stom switching the lights on and off
[0:38:15] <$SGrim> Good fucking choice!
[0:38:20] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> Pat, you were talking about horror films on the podcast a few weeks ago. Have you seen Evil Within 2017? It's hella goofy but super interesting.

[0:38:49] <%sumrand0> I cant wait to hear the narration of all the dumb shit you can choose to do in the game
[0:38:50] <%rawrmeowxd> Jazz Musicians are the evilest
[0:38:51] <%GarbageNirvana> Aw
[0:38:51] <%asgard147> or payed even
[0:38:54] <@commanderclaw> New Cuno though
[0:38:55] <himbearbedtime> They must tie him to a chair and give him all the tea he needs to clear his throat
[0:38:56] <%KineticZen> It's also an indie production made by a collective that made, comparatively speaking, a shitload of money without middlemen
[0:38:58] <%TheHappyCynic> that dudes making MONEY
[0:38:59] <+Vikbosss> Где Элмо и Зангиеф?
[0:39:07] <%TheHappyCynic> FUCK YEAH JAZZ MUSICIAN

[0:39:21] <himbearbedtime> BIG
[0:39:24] <%AEUG_Ace_Kamille> New Cuno I don't mind because I didn't like his voice, but I understand why people would like to keep.
[0:39:27] <+donpatrondx> after killing hos throat like that
[0:39:28] <+snaggletusks> as someone who has never heard of disco elysium, this is great info
[0:39:28] <@commanderclaw> It's BIGGER than war & peace!
[0:39:31] <%TIME_PUNCHER> jazz musicians, the evilest of vocalists
[0:39:31] <+OwlLightningMage> I HOPE that he's getting paid
[0:39:33] <%RD_nx> how long is DE
[0:39:34] <%rawrmeowxd> Story Time the game
[0:39:34] <%valcheese> I'm doing DUNE on audio books; 21 hours per book :D
[0:39:38] <%sumrand0> War and Peace is great for hollowing out and making into a stash box
[0:39:41] <+OwlLightningMage> I hope they aren't getting screwed
[0:39:41] <yourliteraldog> I thought Blues Musicians were the evilest. Jazz Musicians are the most intoxicated
[0:39:42] <+ringabal> That's about 2 whole visual novels!
[0:39:42] <daniphofani> Pat are you playing the whole game or just Bowser's Fury or is this a one-off
[0:39:44] <+3amsoda> files size on that game is gonna be huge with all that voice acting
[0:39:44] <%asgard147> Has anyone ever ACTUALLY done that, by the way?
[0:39:46] <%X2Eliah> HELLL NO

[0:44:13] <%cowardman93> did you find a button that demands food cause I'm sure he'll press that one
[0:44:14] <%Alazull> No bork to bust

[0:44:14] <%cylish> unless its dinner time
[0:44:16] <yourliteraldog> Communicates through Jowel Noise
[0:44:17] <%psidefx> @QueequegTheater True shit
[0:44:21] <%the22cstomp> is it a rebellious phase
[0:44:21] <rosemon5001> has he been watching naruto training to become a ninja hound?
[0:44:22] <GustauveVIII> did he bark when he was first brought home?
[0:44:22] <+OwlLightningMage> FOOD FOOD FOOD FOOD FOOD
[0:44:25] <%Das_Bass> uh oh stinky
[0:44:26] <+b_aleph> you bark in his place then!
[0:44:26] <jamsbybetty> too fat to bark
[0:44:27] <%mousesorcerer> LUL
[0:44:31] <%JumboCrunchies> My dog howled once as a puppy and scared the shit out of himself. He's now near silent 80% of the time.
[0:44:31] <%BubbaRands> *presses buttons* Zangief! COONSOOM!
[0:44:32] <bob900000> except for monke
[0:44:35] <%Ranryu692> it sucks
[0:44:35] <%Das_Bass> psaDogchamp
[0:44:36] <%cowardman93> my bulldog like never barks
[0:44:37] <+CookieCutter007> monkaS
[0:44:37] <%JoshManVGH> But when he does surprisingly, it will be VERY telling.
[0:44:40] <%QueequegTheater> Yappy dogs are fucking AWFUL to deal with
[0:44:41] <%RD_nx> perfect streamer dog
[0:44:42] <iceballstwitch> extremely quiet? I've heard zangief yelp like a child when paige feeds him in the other room
[0:44:48] <%cowardman93> he was hungry
[0:44:50] <@commanderclaw> He wants food
[0:44:52] <%psidefx> My pup was the same
[0:44:52] <DianaTheAscian> sounds evil
[0:44:54] <%gitgouda> time for bowsers furry
[0:44:54] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Might just be a bulldog thing, mine barely ever bark
[0:44:55] <+sumrand0> Wish my dog could learn from Zangief. Love my rescue but holy shit tiny dogs LOVE barking nonstop
[0:44:55] <KingVantq> @PatStaresAt his brain has to process the bark command alot it seems LUL
[0:44:56] <powerprotoman> silence of the hams
[0:44:58] <TurtlesAndTentacles> My dog is 13 and doesnt bark...but is also half blind
[0:45:03] <%wibbwobbler> psaDogchamp
[0:45:10] <%RD_nx> it means that when he DOES bark, there will be something wrong
[0:45:12] <%JoshManVGH> Bark powerful and needs much energy and foods
[0:45:13] <+waltzqueen> seems like your dog has a Serious Nature, no stats boosts, here
[0:45:16] <%brickwall35> I'm not like most girls
[0:45:18] <%josstil> THAT TIME I GOT REINCARNATED AS A DOG
[0:45:18] <%cowardman93> oh my bulldog loves the car
[0:45:20] <%rawrmeowxd> He's quirky LUL
[0:45:21] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt They're very dumb but also very smart
[0:45:23] <%sumrand0> bizarre or ADORABLE
[0:45:26] <%KineticZen> Aww
[0:45:34] <%gitgouda> gief only going by the footage is one of the calmest puppies ive ever seen.
[0:45:34] <@commanderclaw> So a perfect fit for your weirdo menagerie you've got in that house
[0:45:41] <JanusII> I love bulldogs, family used to breed them.
[0:45:44] <%DukeBlack_> that's cap
[0:45:45] <%X2Eliah> yeah that is weird for a dog
[0:45:46] <Visorak6> Threat display
[0:45:49] <fat_burtreynolds> Bork he’s calculating in his brain if it’s worth it to Bork Bork
[0:45:50] <%sumrand0> yeah the eye contact thing is kinda weird actually haha
[0:45:52] <SilverFaustX> eye contact is domination
[0:45:54] <%psidefx> FALSE
[0:45:54] <Kiraklene> Mine loves eye contact, actually both
[0:45:54] <%QueequegTheater> Right into your soul
[0:45:55] <+MooseIsGoose> My dog loved that. I only had 2 that liked eye contact.
[0:45:59] <%Ganerumo> Dogs actually seek out eye contact to feel comfortable if they are used to you
[0:46:00] <+ApocalypticExpress> my cocker also stares
[0:46:01] <SilverFaustX> if u look away u are the bitch
[0:46:02] <%brickwall35> that's super not true. dogs love eye contact with trusted individuals
[0:46:03] <Kashi_Nin> Havanese do that as well
[0:46:03] <fat_burtreynolds> You sure that dog isn’t a Baby??
[0:46:05] <%MidnightBurst12> he is challenging the world
[0:46:06] <%furiousfurioso> is that why dogs hate me because I always look at their eyes
[0:46:11] <rytisone> bulldogs are yandere
[0:46:12] <JanusII> Other dogs are scared of bulldogs.
[0:46:13] <%rawrmeowxd> awwww
[0:46:17] <%cowardman93> @PatStaresAt dude my bulldog stares at me while jerking off
[0:46:17] <%Monkeyweed21> My dog demands eye contact
[0:46:19] <Derpicus> my pitbull does the same thing, just stares for 10-15 minutes but the ears are always all the way back
[0:46:20] <SilverFaustX> same with cats
[0:46:20] <%JumboCrunchies> My papillon does the eye contact thing.
[0:46:26] <+psidefx> Look my dog in the face then she wags her lil nub IMMEDIATELY
[0:46:26] <watery_salsa> thats so sad
[0:46:28] <himbearbedtime> -5 CHA
[0:46:30] <%gitgouda> thats very sad
[0:46:30] <%KineticZen> Misunderstood dogs
[0:46:30] <%UvBenServed> Too pure
[0:46:32] <%JoshManVGH> Aww
[0:46:33] <Kashi_Nin> Havanese do the eye contact thing I mean, for context
[0:46:34] <yourliteraldog> Accidentally aggressive dog
[0:46:34] <%sumrand0> Smaller the dog the more aggressive I should know based on experience
[0:46:37] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt u hear they made Kaine even more pissed at all times?
[0:46:37] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt My bulldog when I was a kid became attached to our mom and didn't even like other dogs coming near her
[0:46:39] <%brickwall35> @cowardman93 why is your dog jerking off
[0:46:41] <nopgnikatnight> How fat is Zangief
[0:46:43] <watery_salsa> OH GOOD
[0:46:44] <watery_salsa> thank god
[0:46:46] <%gitgouda> aw my heart is melting and it hurts
[0:46:47] <%GarbageNirvana> D'aww
[0:47:01] <%KeiganOfAstora> @PatStaresAt Where is the cat tree?!
[0:47:04] <%Monkeyweed21> @brickwall35 Dogs can in fact learn to masturbate
[0:47:08] <%cowardman93> @brickwall35 I don't know! He does it with his paw while staring at me and it's super uncomfortable
[0:47:09] <%sumrand0> Bulldogs break the typical rules of dog size
[0:47:18] <%gitgouda> cause hes human
[0:47:19] <Visorak6> because woolie?
[0:47:22] <@SoFarFetched> @KeiganOfAstora pats been busy so he hasn't gotten around to the cat tree
[0:47:22] <%Alazull> Dumb?
[0:47:24] <+nicoleymcquack> Yeah my dog considers bulldog snorts a threat

[0:47:31] <%MidnightBurst12> old age?
[0:47:32] <%QueequegTheater> His dreads contained the memories
[0:47:33] <%RetributionP> because it's blue and not purple
[0:47:33] <+OwlLightningMage> Woolie is bad a things
[0:47:34] <bob900000> LUL
[0:47:36] <fat_burtreynolds> Other then the Geifster, what’s your favorite kind of doggo Pat?

[0:47:46] <UnfilteredComic> was probably way more interesting news that week
[0:47:49] <+MostRefinedCalla> He forgot because he replaced it with guilty gear lore
[0:47:50] <DianaTheAscian> It takes 95% of his brain power
[0:47:52] <iceballstwitch> been relistening to the old podcasts again while playing game for the past few weeks. You guys forget that you talked about stuff A LOT
[0:47:56] <%sumrand0> Woolie was busy playing Pazaak in his head
[0:47:58] <+OwlLightningMage> Woolie loves his own terrible ideas
[0:47:58] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Because it wasnt a punchgirl

[0:48:13] <%QueequegTheater> Oh this guy was in the subreddit
[0:48:18] <%cvp5127> its a funny bit
[0:48:19] <%sumrand0> @ballerswagbro9k youre not wrong
[0:48:21] <$SGrim> @PatStaresAt Woolie forgot because long-term memory is stored in the left hemisphere of the brain, but he put that story on the right by mistake.

[0:49:44] <%X2Eliah> Woolie is the Joe Rogan of Fighting Games
[0:49:50] <%MisterRockett> I feel like we're just counting the days till Woolie vs FFXIV

[0:50:08] <+CookieCutter007> I love the delay
[0:50:10] <%AEUG_Ace_Kamille> Yeah, to be fair, I get that and I'm still into fighting games.

[0:50:37] <DianaTheAscian> Thats sad
[0:50:37] <+tigerfang86> but what about when GG STRIVE COMES OUT PAT
[0:50:38] <SilverFaustX> fighting games are dead
[0:50:40] <+OwlLightningMage> Pat is super right
[0:50:40] <%Agami23> fighting games will never improve. they will just say fans can make their own sollutions
[0:50:42] <$SGrim> @PatStaresAt just use it to play dark souls
[0:50:42] <%Monkeyweed21> KI has good netcode when it isnt dead
[0:50:43] <SupaDanBot> What about KoF 2002?
[0:50:46] <%sumrand0> Perfect netcode fighting game cool! but too bad its a fighiting game

[0:51:02] <%RD_nx> I hope strive is good, Ramlethals trailer bummed me out
[0:51:03] <%AEUG_Ace_Kamille> @commanderclaw Fighting games have given me some of the most hype in games but fuck online.
[0:51:05] <%MugenSandan> @patstaresat Well next time Woolie talks about fighting games just say "Mhmm yes yes hadouken. oh that's very YRC of them"
[0:51:08] <%X2Eliah> Where I'm from, "Arcades" were never even a thing. Woolie's fighting game talk is completely unrelatable
[0:51:08] <%holydeviant1> It's like that crustacean evolution thing. Sticks just gravitate behind chairs
[0:51:10] <+luftraumm1> pat, if you could, wich fighting game would you play?
[0:51:11] <+OwlLightningMage> I hope Strive works so I can actually play it

[1:01:31] <HeroToxiko> ye
[1:01:35] <VoraciousKain> I mean someone can just make an alt on the subreddit so it doesn't matter

[1:02:01] <himbearbedtime> and then he disappeared
[1:02:02] <%toastybites> The man just straight up dropped a multi million dollar contract and left comedy
[1:02:06] <JustYudha> "it's just a joke bro"
[1:02:07] <%QueequegTheater> @b_aleph Dave Chappelle
[1:02:07] <%kullumanati> Wholesome Mario stream
[1:02:08] <%sumrand0> In other words much like Chappelle & Dan Harmon making funny jokes is a talent that requires discretion that idiots quoting them dont have
[1:02:09] <%psidefx> He DOES have his show and name right back tho
[1:02:10] <+b_aleph> Who's Zangief????
[1:02:10] <Ethel9727> Chapelle is my favorite comedian that I will not and should not ever quote
[1:02:11] <%goatbait> Does he still do stand up?
[1:02:11] <+LionKagura> @b_aleph cmonBruh
[1:02:14] <%dd44dostivei> story of the 2000s honestly

[1:02:23] <%maenos2> also like, chapelle could get away with that MAYBE. but you, moptherfucker? you're not Chapelle
[1:02:24] <VoraciousKain> liar
[1:02:25] <disflipmat> Yeah, at the time I was mad at Chappelle for giving up on his show cause it was hilarious, but looking back I can def understand that he saw too many people were just completely missing the point of his jokes
[1:02:25] <%GarbageNirvana> Went to Africa for a while
[1:02:26] <northstarotaku11> thats why it aired in season three
[1:02:33] <%GiantRatThatMakesTheRulz> GiantRatThatMakesTheRulz subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 7 months! Hooray! Looks like I'll be getting a 2nd part time job! In addition to being a student assistant at the histology section of a lab, I'll also be a delivery driver for auto parts. Yay money!
[1:02:34] <@commanderclaw> Nintendo is glad to provide this stream full of good Mario content

[1:03:09] <bob900000> have you ever unbaned someone
[1:03:10] <%Alazull> By the by, the rules are very open.
[1:03:11] <%Agami23> the mods work really hard and are really good at being mods.
[1:03:13] <thetruthofyourbeing> cancer discord Lmao
[1:03:15] <%whyskeywolfe> You've mostly got nice mods though.
[1:03:15] <crazzmatazz2> its the right way to do it
[1:03:16] <@SoFarFetched> @vVAstrAVv its actually still pretty rare.
[1:03:17] <+b_aleph> You didn't say GTAB tho
[1:03:18] <%AkronymCLT> The Mods are good
[1:03:19] <%justcallmebobplease> Okay but like, you've mentioned how mercurial you are in that if you get paid big enough $$$ you'll do things... so then, wouldn't there be some dollar value where you go 'yeah okay, unbanned - GIB MONEY'?
[1:03:19] <yeetdabsenpai69> so no redemption possible? not even if it was a misunderstanding?
[1:03:19] <+CelioHogane> @thedankestmeeme You aren't missing much, i heard people on that discord are... well.

[1:03:38] <%Ranryu692> People need to learn that if they make an offensive joke and you take them seriously, they should say it was a joke instead of doubling down
[1:03:39] <+CookieCutter007> shoot that guy
[1:03:41] <$velgaduere> it's almost as if people who you grant power to should be able to function autonomously and not as personal extensions of yourself! wow!! /s

[1:03:45] <dragon17013> atpLaw atpCop
[1:03:46] <@SoFarFetched> and if you know that "but Im not breaking the rules" that means you're doing it on purpose.
[1:03:47] <%CapnClassix> Rule #1: Don't be a shit
[1:03:47] <%holydeviant1> Rule Zero: I AM GOD HERE
[1:03:47] <Meekest> Pat will ban you for not breaking the rules HARD ENOUGH
[1:03:48] <%KeiganOfAstora> This is just a sad and angry topic. Let's all move on
[1:03:48] <akibanoman> As long as you don't DSP it ur good imo
[1:03:48] <$SGrim> Well shit, I guess if it's a technicality you can technically go fuck yourself. LUL
[1:03:49] <%OctaivianRex> What happens if you ban your own account? Do you stop existing?
[1:03:50] <VoraciousKain> make an alt and get rebanned to cancel out the original ban
[1:03:50] <Visorak6> At the end of the day it's your show and if you want to blow someone up you can for whatever
[1:03:50] <%psidefx> "Well techincally get fuck out the chat"
[1:03:50] <+tigerfang86> its a FUCKING TWITCH CHAT

[1:03:56] <%BigCoffee> Hey how do I rejoin the discord chat anyway? I think my sub just dropped. Anyway, Pat what's the easiest DPS and healer and tank in ff14 ?
[1:03:58] <shaddydaddyo> but pat we love you
[1:03:58] <%MisterRockett> Chapelle specifically mentions going to Disney World and a white family approaching him and telling him their favorite skit was the N*** family. Which is A) Inappropriate and B) Not his best skit.
[1:03:59] <FoxInABeret> People forget they're not arguing before a judge. There's no rules that have to be followed as a matter of course.
[1:03:59] <Mattais88> Oh no, I can't shitpost!
[1:04:00] <%anticrust> Oh no I have to make a new account @PatStaresAt
[1:04:00] <%Alazull> In that case you'd be much better off accepting a ban and apologizing if you do feel bad
[1:04:00] <iceballstwitch> do you ban people for accidentally breaking rules if they immediately apologize?
[1:04:01] <+TheBitingIrish> BANNED for trying to game the system
[1:04:01] <thetruthofyourbeing> literally make a new accp
[1:04:01] <+senoue> People like feeling part of something
[1:04:04] <+paladinstarbuster> I'm glad
[1:04:05] <%RetributionP> this is the guy that wants to be the holder of government secrets
[1:04:06] <Ethel9727> What if I don't technically break the rule about not technically breaking the rules by technically breaking the rules?
[1:04:10] <%wibbwobbler> pls ban me
[1:04:11] <Darren716> What bs is that? Youre gonna ban them for rules not listed? Like at least ban them for a real reason. I mod a fairly large sub reddit, you gotta give them a reason for their ban
[1:04:12] <%KeiganOfAstora> Rule #1: Don't be a shit Rule #2: I get to define what being a shit is
[1:04:12] <dmtjinni> cant yell L U L
[1:04:12] <fairore> God my nose feel awful
[1:04:12] <%whyskeywolfe> Get a new credit card ya babies.
[1:04:13] <dragon17013> atpLaw atpRtsd
[1:04:13] <%luftraumm1> that's why in theory there is presumption of innocence IN COURT
[1:04:15] <%SirGO0SE> A FATE WORSE THAN DEATH
[1:04:15] <+TheBitingIrish> GO RIGHT, DOOFUS
[1:04:16] <%twistedj3ster> oh, you can still watch the streams? then who cares?
[1:04:16] <+tigerfang86> Actually @PatStaresAt you have to go right
[1:04:16] <%JoshManVGH> Damn now I need to watch this alone in my own room. What a change
[1:04:16] <%justcallmebobplease> Pat, think how rich you could be if you put a dollar value on 'get unbanned, you jackass'?
[1:04:17] <thetruthofyourbeing> OSFrog OSFrog OSFrog
[1:04:17] <lessthanhuman_tv> But Pat! I've given you so much money so you're my friend!
[1:04:17] <Sotetsu> But Pat, if you ban me your depriving your chat of my wit, which is why they are here.
[1:04:17] <pal8080> you mean right
[1:04:18] <%Mrbaconator> DIG UP STUPID
[1:04:19] <%sumrand0> yeah but ppl that are stress out by low stakes like they dont usually have to deal with adversity so its the end of their world
[1:04:19] <%MugenSandan> But Pat my PARASOCIAL ENGAGEMENT
[1:04:19] <+MegaCorpltd> This chat is my life force
[1:04:20] <Enyoyable> Can't yell Poggers T__T
[1:04:20] <+abrupt_abe> But you should have gone left though
[1:04:20] <%Agami23> hey pro tip for not getting banned for breaking the rules. dont break the rules
[1:04:22] <Harro8> Yeah people just don't like the unreasonable logic
[1:04:23] <@Fuggins4U> Welp, time to go back to the Yahoo Pool chatroom.
[1:04:23] <@SoFarFetched> @BigCoffee check your discord settings with twitch connections and manually enter the server by clicking on pats name
[1:04:23] <pmda2126> go right though
[1:04:24] <SilverFaustX> twitch can ban the channel for harassment
[1:04:27] <%cylish> just cuz the rules didn't cover your specific brand of shitty doesn't mean you're not being shitty
[1:04:27] <%chiazam> just make a new account
[1:04:27] <pmda2126> or up
[1:04:28] <%Monkeyweed21> I've been banned by pat for like a day for being wrong about Bayonetta and I'm still here get over it

[1:04:36] <+paladinstarbuster> I m glad Woolz has a better dispsition
[1:04:36] <bob900000> can't they just make a new account?
[1:04:37] <%king_wragles> He might actually like it, Cholula is great
[1:04:38] <%KeiganOfAstora> But what if the rules aren't defined until after you break them?
[1:04:38] <%jdhwash> why are people saying shit even closely pertaining to child support, wife beating, racism, or anything along those lines in a video game stream chat? this is like, the second time in as many weeks you've had to have this conversation
[1:04:39] <Meekest> Being unable to yell at you when you do dumb things is very difficult to deal with
[1:04:42] <%rawrmeowxd> big mad
[1:04:42] <%Dwarven_Gaming> oh yeah, i never got added to the server, is there a link?
[1:04:42] <%SirGO0SE> take that out of context

[1:17:32] <+b_aleph> Can we get a pit bull next?

[1:17:33] <Srthunda> what if they were a giant corgi

[1:20:45] <%JumboCrunchies> WAR for tank, SAM for DPS
[1:20:45] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> I think about the finger gun sence from Tales form the Broderlands
[1:20:46] <Manwad> just fel cleave lol

[1:20:54] <DianaTheAscian> WAR has 1 button
[1:20:54] <%SvenHolgersson> "fun"?
[1:20:56] <@commanderclaw> *Cries in MNK*
[1:20:56] <Profmcstevie> Warriors developing arthritis due to lack of finger movementr
[1:20:57] <xeros720> eh, i thought DRGs had a lot of buttons at high level
[1:20:58] <SomersaultJustice> but fell cleave tho
[1:21:00] <$apolitenoob> Wait, who's complaining? I'm not complaining, Fell Cleaves do huge damage
[1:21:00] <%senoue> Is there any way around having to pay monthly for FF14? It looks cool, but monthlys give me hesitance @PatStaresAt
[1:21:01] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Also we need tastier crayons
[1:21:02] <%LeiaSkynoober> Oh sick, I'm gonna level WAR
[1:21:02] <+donpatrondx> their loop is the same
[1:21:02] <+TheBitingIrish> SAM is kinda braindead
[1:21:04] <fairore> what
[1:21:07] <BoxNavy> thats why i play it
[1:21:09] <xeros720> oh, Dancer is pretty brainless
[1:21:09] <%JumboCrunchies> OH RIGHT DANCER
[1:21:10] <+TheBitingIrish> Oh yeah, Dancer
[1:21:11] <@SSaryn> PLD if you want a brain dead rotation once you know what you're doing
[1:21:12] <Byr0nX> Yep then MNK
[1:21:13] <%SilvaChariot0133> SAM too yeah
[1:21:14] <Wildpandaman> Their whole identity is fell cleave which is sad
[1:21:15] <voltage996> def SAM
[1:21:15] <%KineticZen> Dancer is for people who like to flip coins
[1:21:16] <%rusttyphoon> MCH is more braindead
[1:21:17] <%Figleafplays> is WAR a good place to start then if you dont know shit about tanking yet?
[1:21:17] <shaddydaddyo> commanderclaw LUL
[1:21:18] <Byr0nX> As a lvl 80 mnk
[1:21:18] <@SSaryn> DNC doesn't exist till 50 to be fair.
[1:21:18] <disflipmat> What about MCH?
[1:21:19] <maddragon249> WAR only needs fell cleave
[1:21:19] <Sotetsu> Oh good, it's not Dragoon anymore?
[1:21:20] <%QueequegTheater> @LeiaSkynoober ONE OF US ONE OF US
[1:21:22] <+ApocalypticExpress> Sam u Got Positionals
[1:21:23] <BoxNavy> its whack a mole with some weaving
[1:21:25] <%GarbageNirvana> You press a button and you're better
[1:21:27] <%KeiganOfAstora> !uptime
[1:21:28] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt you have so little to hit you even have space on the first cross hotbar
[1:21:28] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 21m.
[1:21:28] <%Monkeyweed21> SAM is for big babies that can't do positionals
[1:21:29] <Byr0nX> YEP
[1:21:30] <Profmcstevie> A-B-C-D, repeat
[1:21:31] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Isn't RDM similar
[1:21:33] <%Dwarven_Gaming> what about machinist?
[1:21:33] <RamenRiderZ> MCH if you have good internets
[1:21:34] <%CzeekyPlays> DRK is really braindead too
[1:21:34] <xeros720> dancer tells you how to play it
[1:21:34] <%caramelatte1> Redmage is too complex
[1:21:36] <+TheBitingIrish> @Byr0nX But positionals NotLikeThis
[1:21:38] <+CarpeDeezKnuts> Summoner is where it's at
[1:21:44] <+geistuser> monk is also like that?\
[1:21:46] <%cvp5127> wasnt it dragoon?
[1:21:47] <+TenguGemini> what do you think it needs to be done to fix Bard?
[1:21:48] <%sumrand0> @officioprefectuscorgi handsdown my favorite unexpected bit from that whole game (still an amazing game in other regards to be clear)
[1:21:49] <Loarfy> badass im gonna get dancer immediately
[1:21:50] <Byr0nX> MNK goes 123 3 different ways
[1:21:50] <%the22cstomp> dancer takes 0 effort
[1:21:50] <BoxNavy> dancer is fun too
[1:21:51] <%Alazull> Yeah Dancer is p. easy
[1:21:52] <%AEUG_Ace_Kamille> Yeah, Red Mage is DNC for caster.
[1:21:54] <%anticrust> Gornmage
[1:21:54] <%0rond> I never see dancers
[1:21:55] <%Monkeyweed21> Dancer's combos are two buttons
[1:21:56] <%JumboCrunchies> The difference is that RDM doesnt do Damage
[1:21:57] <Wildpandaman> Hey pat can i ask a 14 questions had a really bad experience in the Aether server with toxic people, and want to get more into raiding and meet more people would you recommend a server?
[1:22:00] <%Alazull> RDM at least needs to think about when to go in
[1:22:01] <+TheBitingIrish> Dancer gonna get some nerfs come 6.0
[1:22:01] <Byr0nX> @TheBitingIrish you get used to them like its nothing
[1:22:02] <%QueequegTheater> DRG isn't hard but it's far from braindead
[1:22:02] <%Nekros4442> machinist has alotnof buttons too
[1:22:03] <+CookieCutter007> FeelsBadMan Dragoon bois
[1:22:04] <+ApocalypticExpress> hope Sage is a brain-dead Healer
[1:22:07] <%BigCoffee> Dragoon has a lot of issues, weaving fucking shit constantly
[1:22:10] <BoxNavy> they dont need to give dancer new moves
[1:22:12] <ammobasket> And it starts at 60!
[1:22:14] <BoxNavy> titty
[1:22:17] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt that meter u get at 80 could use more to do with though
[1:22:18] <+ApocalypticExpress> you press one button and all the barriers
[1:22:19] <%wibbwobbler> nice
[1:22:19] <%mousesorcerer> ???
[1:22:20] <%sumrand0> Plus dancers get to play the song Maniac while they play
[1:22:21] <+EyeFarted> stroke
[1:22:22] <+b_aleph> titty?
[1:22:24] <+ApocalypticExpress> BARRIERS WHEN I ATTACK
[1:22:26] <+ladomania> please just fix monk
[1:22:26] <%Monkeyweed21> MNK looks at E9S and just fucking dies
[1:22:27] <xeros720> DRG has multiple combo routes, so you can make it more intensive
[1:22:29] <%CzeekyPlays> DNC is the ultimate "i'm pretty bad but still want to help my team"
[1:22:30] <%0rond> than how come I pretty much never see dancers
[1:22:37] <BoxNavy> monkaS
[1:22:38] <ammobasket> I started with Dragoon, it was a good ramp

[1:25:52] <Mattais88> The snow outside right now is taller than my dog
[1:25:53] <%Dingalow> Was that town in Britain, by any chance?
[1:25:53] <%caramelatte1> If not prepared 1 inch of snow is bloody dangerious
[1:25:55] <%KeiganOfAstora> @QueequegTheater Virginia is like that too.
[1:25:55] <%rawrmeowxd> @TheBitingIrish He would probably like that actually lol
[1:25:55] <%ospreyworks> Holy shit
[1:25:57] <%vexion_smh> You did it psaDab
[1:25:58] <+ladomania> I couldn't open my car door because of the ice
[1:25:58] <%MidnightBurst12> toilet training time
[1:25:59] <%Dr_DangerPhD> almost as if places that don't get snow aren't used to driving in it
[1:26:00] <Profmcstevie> Iced roads SUCK though
[1:26:08] <%YakumoYomi> That's Charlotte. A call for "winter weather" and everyone freaks out

[1:26:16] <%ospreyworks> It's not a joke when people don't know how to drive on ice or their cars aren't ready for it
[1:26:18] <%JoshManVGH> Hell, if there's no removal, there's also no pre-treatment
[1:26:20] <Mattais88> I rmemebr that
[1:26:22] <%KeiganOfAstora> They're inexperienced usually
[1:26:29] <BlueLunecy> I saw a big ol 100 man pile up in Texas the other day since people kept sliding on the ice they weren't used to
[1:26:30] <%MidnightBurst12> they don't have the infrastructure
[1:26:30] <%BigCoffee> We in Montreal are also a stupid kind of people, where we spend all of winter in our sneakers. People walk outside in sneakers and with ankle socks, all year long. You ever go out in 2 feet of snow in Converse shoes !?
[1:26:31] <%Dingalow> The army had come in???

[1:26:41] <+frenchyred0> Huh, I'm on Toronto. I don't recall that but maybe I'm just dumb and don't remember.

[2:07:22] <%0rond> Hey Pat, have you considered doing another intro to ffxiv like you did with shadowbringers? maybe just a sequel to that one with what changed? @PatStaresAt
[2:07:24] <%Valdorick> Blast those furry rocks
[2:07:26] <dan_g_v> this is just like Fatalis!
[2:07:30] <%darklordfodder> "Blast the Furry Blocks"
[2:07:33] <+ReallyBigRocks> he HATES it
[2:07:34] <dapperskeleton69> DAMAGE
[2:07:35] <%brickwall35> MY EYES
[2:07:35] <%YakumoYomi> Blast the Furry Rocks!
[2:07:39] <%cowardman93> oh man you can see a line in the water where it stops animating
[2:07:39] <%asgard147> What is with this metal in my Mario game?
[2:07:40] <%kyh9> How is the new world?
[2:07:40] <Srthunda> is that a life bar?
[2:07:41] <%linSP> use da laser
[2:07:41] <%coreyyotto> look at that fucking health bar
[2:07:41] <%holydeviant1> is that a tiny health bar
[2:07:44] <derekwst3> back to the woolie hole
[2:07:46] <%kyh9> Is this Bowser's Fury any good?
[2:07:46] <%0rond> bowser the shut in
[2:07:48] <%Movemeister> Furry rockets Kreygasm
[2:07:53] <%Punchasaur> uhhhhhh so i'm doing research on nylabones and am finding no evidence on them being toxic
[2:07:54] <+Aeogard> Aeogard subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 29 months, currently on a 4 month streak! mario games? in my pat streams? it's more likely than you think
[2:07:55] <scrublordsamurai> whats up gang?
[2:07:57] <+Veraverse> We did it. We saved the city
[2:07:57] <%BoxNavy> i did it :)
[2:07:58] <Ranger747> he just turned fLux off
[2:07:59] <dan_g_v> no, I did it
[2:08:01] <$SGrim> @PatStaresAt good job getting those furry rocks off.
[2:08:01] <+ReallyBigRocks> I helped
[2:08:01] <iceballstwitch> why does he have a musou elite fodder health bar
[2:08:02] <Broken_Sonex> Was that.......a life bar?
[2:08:05] <%cowardman93> 1 level
[2:08:15] <Blackarrow1212> he flushed himself?
[2:08:23] <shamefulbowsettefolder> I’m doing my part!
[2:08:23] <%kyh9> This almost feels like a Demo for Odyssey 2
[2:08:24] <fritz_dacat> Is the water frozen now?
[2:08:30] <+Veraverse> I guess he will...
[2:08:39] <%cowardman93> I could see them doing a different enemy for each stage
[2:08:39] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Very Simon's Quest
[2:08:41] <xeros720> he seems to be doing it every 10-15 minutes
[2:08:42] <%YakumoYomi> That was IGN's complaint: Bowser's appearances become annoying
[2:08:46] <%Undenizen> the Narrative in this game is EXTREMELY abstract
[2:08:49] <powerprotoman> its really not that annoying
[2:08:51] <dapperskeleton69> "mario, the bowser moon has risen again..."
[2:08:54] <ergulor> maybe a big differnt mechanic per world
[2:08:54] <Profmcstevie> Too bad, that's THE gimmick of the mode. Have a terrible curse bitch
[2:09:09] <+ShinBojangles> wtf is that fall speed LUL
[2:09:22] <rameiramaster> Is that Pepe?
[2:09:23] <%linSP> pretty sure there’s bowser blocks in every level
[2:09:23] <$SGrim> It's a cat purse
[2:09:24] <%kyh9> Is this just a tech-demo for Odyssey 2 built in the 3D World engine?
[2:09:26] <%JumboCrunchies> I think I'd prefer if you could toggle pissed off bowser intentionally
[2:09:28] <%RyderTokage> I think it might just be in any area that doesn't have a lighthouse active
[2:09:29] <%QueequegTheater> I love Bowser Jr. he's just a good boy
[2:09:34] <%THATGUY_789> a coin bitch
