[0:18:22] <$shurtal> cheer500 Hey Pat, had an experience at work today, should make for good tv for you. I was on the toilet, gettin shit done, when I looked down and saw a spider just to the right of the buttons. I promptly freaked out a little bit (on account of the mild to moderate arachnophobia) and proceeded to slap my chest, causing the spider to fly off my chest... and land in my pants. I quickly toed my shoe off and extricated the leg. I now know what "gettin the shit scared out of me" really feels like.

[0:30:19] <+captain_history> it is
[0:30:20] <haisho> and Pat is stuck already
[0:30:20] <%ElenaManetta> Reminds me of old Disney SNES animations
[0:30:22] <+Atomik456> downstairs?
[0:30:23] <Saltmeisterr> the animation in this game is stellar
[0:30:27] <%Goldenwolf98> This is one of the most stylish games released in a long time
[0:30:27] <%corepool> yea its really smooth
[0:30:29] <Tennochief> press pause now to get the tutorial out of the way
[0:30:29] <%Dr00_PhD> Absolutely beautiful
[0:30:29] <%starotter70> I remember seeing development tweets of this and thinking it looked nuts
[0:30:29] <%Fear_Ranjer> I thought Kyoko sounded familiar!
[0:30:31] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat Pixel-mation is under appreciated
[0:30:32] <+VektorTroika> chain get

[0:31:01] <+MisterRockett> Oh my god ZaDoorman you're making jokes, right?
[0:31:06] <SleepyMaribo> each enemy type has 5 grunts you can recruit, a leader you ca nrecruit and a special rare version that shows up on some screens
[0:31:07] <+MisterRockett> I hate all of you guys
[0:31:09] <%IMDRanged> "There you go. DIE"

[1:18:53] <%NeroInfinite> yes
[1:18:55] <%GabeSweetMan> Launcher?
[1:18:56] <nademonkey1100> this game looks pretty cool
[1:18:57] <hiroy_raind> Important tips that the game doesn't tell you: consuming foods & items for the first time gives you permanent stat upgrade. Balance between eating and getting new moves early on, otherwise it might be a bit painful early on
[1:18:59] <%Plankman> tien launcher
[1:19:00] <%Louie_Salmon> What a good voice actor and terrible most other things
[1:19:00] <%AncelDeLambert> that's... odd

[1:19:11] <+IronPickle> Confirmed it is Jimmy Lee. He said, "I miss my borther." This likely takes place after then end of Double Dragon 1 where Jimmy is the shadow boss. Billy must not have made it
[1:19:12] <%GabeSweetMan> LAUNCHER YEAH

[1:47:51] <ThirdPersonPhil> Blue money is a 100 around here
[1:48:11] <xeros720> frankensteiner is just a back grab move

[1:48:17] <cascadepersona> Ryu Ga Gotoku kick
[1:48:18] <%razielhex> aerial kombos
[1:48:23] <Wobuzhidao> frank is a useful back grab
[1:48:37] <Lord_of_all_Edges> It's a reward for the back grab
[1:48:37] <Tennochief> dragon feet is great for combos
[1:48:44] <%Dr00_PhD> It's pretty strong but go for the kick
[1:48:51] <%wolfofsound> go be chunners
[1:48:59] <xeros720> become the chun

[2:00:09] <Valdorick> At least this mall cop is paid.
[2:00:11] <$Tuskor13> @Zizou_DW i feel like the creator of the manga that has a character named Red Hot Chili Peppers would be the last person to care that much about copyright

[2:02:19] <qo_op> pat is weak to wakeups, which is why he's late to podcasts
[2:02:22] <hericknhx> There's alot of "getting used" in playing in this game @AngriestPat

[2:03:17] <Valdorick> Spend money before you die and lose money
[2:03:17] <%SummonerMagno> go back, and just stay there

[2:03:19] <%Jekado> so weird it doesn't use bar

[2:03:29] <hiroy_raind> It's good idea in general to stay away from downed enemies after 2-3 stomp to avoid getting attacked on wakeup

[2:04:55] <dynamitedoki> seeing pat play this really makes me happy. This game is getting buried underneath so many AAA games... It really deserves more attention
[2:04:59] <Macfine> that has to be the worst obituary.."Dabbed to death"
[2:05:05] <hericknhx> Mortal Dab
[2:05:07] <jorniev> DEATH DAB is pretty strong
[2:05:10] <%RubberFistFight> hot take: i think dabbing is dumb, and I don't understand the appeal.
[2:05:11] <xeros720> turns out dabbing is hazardous to the health of everyone around the dabber
[2:05:12] <haisho> cheerleaders are the worst. They have an SNK dodge and a dive kick
[2:05:12] <+BoomerTiro> That's what's missing from overwatch and Monster hunter right now, dab

[2:07:15] <%Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for over 2 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 8oz (240mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[2:07:16] <$Tuskor13> "Oh there's the statue" *proceeds to destroy statue by beating it with a goon*
[2:07:17] <Macfine> the music works way better than it feels like it should as a river city throwback

[2:08:15] <Macfine> blocking is cheating
[2:08:19] <%starotter70> apatDab

[2:46:12] <tacomaster740> seems like every beat em up on consoles doesn't have online co op besides like castle Crashers lol
[2:46:13] <Mendin> You blew up a statue of the mayor and you're surprised ten billion dead cops came to make sure the world is a fuck and you're born to die?
[2:46:17] <derekwst3> we all thought paige was in japan, but she was here the whole time
[2:46:17] <@lewdskeletor13> I can’t believe the Mayor owns the police

[3:12:42] <hiroy_raind> Doesn't look like much, but that pogo kick does way more damage than heavy grapple
[3:12:43] <Kefkaisnotamused> Yep, dabbing even hurts those who see it from a distance.
[3:12:43] <%Gogogolem> The dab deals cringe damage
[3:12:48] <%Ion_Laser> @ElenaManetta :D :D :D

[4:02:30] <+TheCrazyOutlaw> Abobo, why are you living in a sewer?
[4:02:31] <blaggablag> I like how his sprite face looks like an angery pug compared to his portrait
[4:02:31] <+VektorTroika> HIS HEAD DEFEATED TEH DAB
[4:02:36] <otakon17> Whup his ass!
[4:02:36] <circular7> head butt too strong
[4:02:37] <%Typhaeon> Oh no, he has anti-dab technology
[4:02:38] <ergheisu> HE TRIES TO DAB BUT DOES NOT UNDERSTAND
[4:02:43] <otakon17> If he blocks, he's gonna headbutt I bet
[4:02:52] <+Starlight_Gamer> is there a parry system?
[4:02:56] <otakon17> yes
[4:02:59] <+DonnyJaBronie> I love this for the simple fact that you are a sorta scrawny highschool girl dabbing on a giant muscle man
[4:03:00] <otakon17> it's tricky though
[4:03:01] <hericknhx> @Starlight_Gamer Ye
[4:03:03] <%DedlokPM> @Starlight_Gamer ye
[4:03:03] <+Memnarch7> WALL JUMPO
[4:03:05] <Onmi_Khaos> So explain to a complete idiot
[4:03:05] <otakon17> Kyoko takes a selife
[4:03:05] <Darkrenai> Dabobo
[4:03:08] <Onmi_Khaos> Whom is Abobo
[4:03:13] <otakon17> WHUP HIM PAT YOU KNOW HIS MOVES NOW!
[4:03:16] <+TheCrazyOutlaw> That headbutt barely does damage if blocked
[4:03:24] <Tupcat> Look at that, he easily understood to use heavy attacks instead of trying to combo lights. That makes him better than half of the Steam reviewers for this game.
[4:03:27] <AlexanderTheConquerer> stop dabbing on abobo LUL
[4:03:32] <otakon17> @Onmi_Khaos he's a boss from Double Dragon
[4:03:37] <+faithless_zealot> Is there no block in this game?
[4:03:41] <Darkrenai> There is
[4:03:42] <Onmi_Khaos> Got it
[4:03:42] <+DonnyJaBronie> he's a classic beat em up character
[4:03:48] <%TimetodiveLTX> dabs are unsafe on block, just like in real life
[4:03:49] <otakon17> Wrong timing for THAT move
[4:03:50] <+faithless_zealot> Oh ok, so Pat's just bad?
[4:03:51] <Megagumballs> the power dab
[4:03:51] <circular7> resistant to dabs

[4:07:24] <@lewdskeletor13> Damn this boss is a real bitch huh
[4:07:24] <otakon17> He blocks WAY too often for combos
[4:07:26] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> There is bullshit then there is bullshit. Only video games can give you the truest form of bullshit.
[4:07:27] <xeros720> it's possible, i think if he spams the cheerleader twist, he;ll be pretty safe
[4:07:29] <sasparillatango> in the words of gafgorian only a fool attacks head on
[4:07:30] <%AppleBasket> can't Pat just block the headbut?
[4:07:31] <otakon17> you gotta use the Heavy on him
[4:07:32] <+twin_triggers> better off with the dab
[4:07:35] <ergheisu> THE DAB IS NOT ENOUGH
[4:07:38] <%Anime_Flux> short controlled bursts
[4:07:40] <%BoboDaHobo> has pat been having any difficulty with twitches disconnects tonight?
[4:07:42] <%ElenaManetta> YEAH Use Z-spacing to your advantage
[4:07:46] <otakon17> The Dab is our BEST hope
[4:07:46] <+GalacticaPhanto> there is a sidequest in the slums he can do for 300 if I can remember
[4:07:48] <xeros720> it's kind of like god hand where they start blocking after you hit them 3 times
[4:07:51] <blaggablag> yeah you basically have to chip him out
[4:07:52] <+faithless_zealot> OMG HE'S LEARNING!
[4:07:53] <Valdorick> This aint his first Beat 'em Up, he just isn't going to let you get free combos.
[4:07:54] <SomersaultJustice> wait, there's a block in this game?
[4:07:55] <circular7> block or parry the headbutt
[4:07:56] <%BioApple> oh hey, pat's blocking
[4:07:56] <dynamitedoki> if u hold block after like 3 or 4 hits u can block his headbutt counter
[4:07:59] <+el_of_house_wood> I’m incredibly bad at this game I’ve been stuck on the first boss for over an hour and a half. @angriestpat
[4:08:04] <+Fynale> oh that's kick ass the whole sound tracks on spotify
[4:08:06] <otakon17> WAIT YOU CAN BLOCK?!
[4:08:09] <ergheisu> !real
[4:08:09] <artificiallynatural> is he.... blocking????
[4:08:11] <Sphincter_Spelunker> you can spam block???
[4:08:11] <+TheCrazyOutlaw> @AppleBasket Yeah, if you block then the headbutt doesnt even do damage
[4:08:11] <+BoomerTiro> So sad to see abobo reduced to this, beating up little girls and still losing after he and his bros together couldn't take Bimmy and Jammy
[4:08:12] <+faithless_zealot> Blocking, FING 5HEAD!
[4:08:21] <Onmi_Khaos> Don't worry El

[4:08:36] <%doc_ock_rokc> pat might blood stave it
[4:08:36] <Marpolo13> hit em with the frame advantage shit SwiftRage
[4:08:38] <otakon17> WE HAVE HIS PATTERN DOWN
[4:08:48] <otakon17> and he can be HIT out of the body slame
[4:08:52] <Nalesh> If only pat would learn how to block
[4:08:53] <%floralkami> i really hope you find out Bimmy is just chilling in the other side of town cause he wants to be his own man.
[4:08:54] <otakon17> You can do it Pat!
[4:08:57] <%ElenaManetta> Pat should just ask Paige to come downstairs for 2 seconds and do co-op for this one boss for extra power boost
[4:08:59] <+Rezca> no wake up
[4:09:05] <otakon17> Hey dude you did WAY better than last time
[4:09:07] <blaggablag> Can you block the slam?
[4:09:08] <Nalesh> Please learn how to block pat
[4:09:09] <+TheCrazyOutlaw> Learning to read Abobos moveset is vital, along with blocking. This fight is ridiculously hard
[4:09:09] <+faithless_zealot> @AngriestPat You're doing better, Pat!
[4:09:10] <Lord_of_all_Edges> You got better
[4:09:10] <xeros720> yeah, he's real

[4:10:02] <otakon17> Maybe you can't parry the headbutt?
[4:10:04] <Tennochief> one of the things I've learned, is to always keep your distance
[4:10:07] <+TheCrazyOutlaw> I can't even count how many times i died on this fight, this boss fight feels like such a spike up in difficulty
[4:10:08] <Kefkaisnotamused> Good job on the meaties though.
[4:10:09] <Nalesh> just block instead of trying to parry

[4:11:48] <hiroy_raind> Yeah, lariat's homing was too good
[4:11:50] <Sol_Install> nah it really no worth when you can get the hits on him tbh
[4:11:52] <%Ixiah> Ixiah subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 9 months, currently on a 9 month streak! Pat will your ever Stream Path of Exile ? A new Season just started and i bet the Chat could help you with Builds. Its even more in depth than Warframe. :)
[4:11:54] <%Antoids> put elmo in as player 2
[4:11:56] <circular7> pat is brute forcing it dark souls style
[4:11:59] <+twin_triggers> hit into dab does more damage
[4:12:00] <otakon17> THE CONFIDENCE GROWS
[4:12:03] <%Luesagna00> @AngriestPat u can't restart from a last save point or something to get the items back?
[4:12:03] <+GalacticaPhanto> there's a quick side quest in the slums you can do for 300$ @angriestpat
[4:12:14] <qo_op> pat used items? PogChamp
[4:12:15] <otakon17> YES TRADE WITH THE BIG BASTARD
[4:12:19] <arkv01> become a god by lighting yourself on fire
[4:12:21] <otakon17> FORCE HIS HEADBUTT
[4:12:23] <%DedlokPM> Ah yes. PUBERTY. Punching Until Bricks Explode Right Towards You
[4:12:25] <Tennochief> we've been skipping a lot of side quests
[4:12:26] <arkv01> the path of carnage
[4:12:27] <+TheCrazyOutlaw> I wouldnt waste money on items for this fight, it's best to wait until you have a good feel for the whole fight itself
[4:12:28] <Valdorick> Yeah but if Abobo blocks the Dab, he's going to eat shit during recovery.
[4:12:29] <cureneckbeard> yeyeyey
[4:12:30] <%Ixiah> where is Paige ? Pat needs a Bloodborne pro here Kappa
[4:12:31] <+DonnyJaBronie> Abobo getting his ass kicked by a dabbing highschooler
[4:12:42] <otakon17> He can't block RIGHT after the headbutt though
[4:12:48] <otakon17> so that's the best time to Dab on him
[4:12:53] <Marpolo13> @DonnyJaBronie how the mighty have fallen
[4:13:05] <Sol_Install> yea it just better for him to pick up
[4:13:12] <+TheCrazyOutlaw> Abobo blocks right after the headbutt, but then you can attack once he drops his block and it'll always hit
[4:13:13] <otakon17> just remember don't stand UNDER the rubble
[4:13:17] <circular7> pat skipping side quests and not using items? shocker...
[4:13:23] <%Antoids> he cant block while hes holding the big slab, either
[4:13:28] <arkv01> he's doin it
[4:13:32] <%Antoids> so another opportunity for BIG DAMAGE
[4:13:35] <otakon17> and he'll ALWAYS go for the rubble throw
[4:13:41] <+DonnyJaBronie> @circular7 I mean he used items, and now he's too poor to use items
[4:13:49] <otakon17> dammit too slow
[4:13:51] <+FoolsArcade> Did this game get a Physical release?
[4:13:52] <+VektorTroika> Despite all his rage, he's just Abobo fightin' Paige

[4:14:45] <circular7> @donnyjabronie pat brute forcing things after using up his items, an even bigger shocker
[4:14:50] <+TheCrazyOutlaw> Yeah, items can't help too much with this fight until you're more familiar with it.
[4:14:51] <+mik255> DAB on them fools
[4:14:51] <otakon17> just straight up KNIFES EDGE BRAWL
[4:15:00] <otakon17> NO ESCAPE JUST PUMMELING TILL IT"S OVER
[4:15:09] <xeros720> i think you might want to go for launchers though
[4:15:13] <%BioApple> you'd think patrick "so i've been grinding a little offscreen" boivin wouldn't be opposed to getting some first aid kits
[4:15:21] <otakon17> Launchers dont' work on Abobo he's TOO big
[4:15:22] <%MegboyManuel> Abobo got his son back, and is at full power now
[4:15:30] <Edible_Enthusiasm> is he... learning?
[4:15:34] <+nekodelic> stomp
[4:15:40] <AlexanderTheConquerer> he already got first aid kits, then he died on the last hit after using them
[4:15:43] <%joylent_blue> this girl can pick up a slab of concrete but cant launch a dude
[4:15:43] <a_mad_dragon> MACHO
[4:15:44] <xeros720> Miyako's moves seem to have more knockback than kyoko's moves, which surprised me
[4:15:52] <%DedlokPM> @BioApple You forget the mind goblins apatGoblin
[4:15:56] <otakon17> yeah that did NOT work
[4:15:57] <Valdorick> Abobo antiair
[4:16:01] <hericknhx> He ant air monkaS
[4:16:02] <Marpolo13> ?
[4:16:03] <%Futurecity10> @AngriestPat You see someone did the cruel angels thesis on the guitars on warframe? I tweeted it to you
[4:16:06] <%nocreditclear> no jumps after first form
[4:16:08] <Mendin> Abobo has fully gone through P.U.B.E.R.T.Y.
[4:16:12] <+VektorTroika> Abobo's polished skull reflects headbounces
[4:16:12] <RyuuAoi> Gotta play this mothafucka like Dark Souls. Don't get greedy!
[4:16:13] <otakon17> yeah jumping on him is no go
[4:16:14] <%Ixiah> Chun Li xD
[4:16:15] <%MegboyManuel> what an ass kicker
[4:16:19] <otakon17> and no money
[4:16:21] <Kefkaisnotamused> Gaaaaaaame over!
[4:16:21] <cureneckbeard> don't give up skeleton
[4:16:23] <lloyddboy> broke as hell
[4:16:24] <%ElenaManetta> You should take a break
[4:16:26] <Marpolo13> headbutt LUL
[4:16:27] <%WackyGear> how many more tries do you think this is going to take
[4:16:27] <%Antoids> did you get my moneye
[4:16:28] <%MegboyManuel> Does Abobo wearing clothing give him this much power?
[4:16:33] <%Forente> abobo don't mess
[4:16:33] <%nocreditclear> you can dumb spam jumps during first form
[4:16:35] <%Anime_Flux> broke af
[4:16:39] <Monkeyweed21> stop taking damage to the same attack and block the headbutt
[4:16:39] <DraconianNexus> that headbutt means buisness
[4:16:39] <otakon17> love that animated intro though
[4:16:45] <hiroy_raind> Man Misako has a much easier time against him, she only needs run+heavy all the time
[4:16:48] <+Estuko> Pat getting crazy close back then seemed to have drained him LUL
[4:16:57] <+VektorTroika> His frickin' Sans grin in the dialogue splash man
[4:17:01] <Kefkaisnotamused> He's wearing Kenshiros shirt. That's the source of his newfound power.
[4:17:02] <%Dr00_PhD> If youre gonna dab do it after 1 hit
[4:17:03] <RyuuAoi> Parry?
[4:17:04] <+HaunchPaunch> Yo, Do it!
[4:17:07] <Monkeyweed21> a way to not suck?
[4:17:08] <+nekodelic> tried grabbing him?
[4:17:13] <Twoiis> finish sentences?
[4:17:21] <ergheisu> `block isn't frame perfect, you have ot use it early
[4:17:21] <circular7> pat - "if only I could cheat..."
[4:17:22] <Dino_from_YoAssThiccPark> nasty DansGame
[4:17:25] <Tupcat> Neutral heavies. Not dabs.
[4:17:27] <+TheCrazyOutlaw> You can get him stuck in his animations if you attack, block, attack, wait, then attack again.
[4:17:40] <xeros720> you don't have a grab button in this game, they have to dizzy first
[4:17:41] <a_mad_dragon> MACHO
[4:17:41] <otakon17> He has on the Poleyns of Power!
[4:17:44] <+TheCrazyOutlaw> At least for the first fight
[4:17:47] <RyuuAoi> DO THAT. LAME IT OUT. DAB HIS ASS TO DEATH.
[4:17:53] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat Easy Mode is now selectable
[4:17:54] <Mendin> Pat is getting too horny for the dab
[4:17:55] <artificiallynatural> stop raw dabbing
[4:17:56] <otakon17> also this looks SO much better in 1080p 60FPS
[4:18:00] <otakon17> maybe I SHOULD get it for PC
[4:18:03] <poweruser> never stop dabbing
[4:18:03] <%TimetodiveLTX> abobo is just too strong
[4:18:06] <otakon17> my rig could DEFINITELY run this
[4:18:06] <circular7> headbutt superior to dab
[4:18:15] <runaraseri> remember pat... lame it out...
[4:18:19] <AlexanderTheConquerer> dabs can't possibly be better on damage/advantage than specials
[4:18:20] <otakon17> Lariat cannot be blocked
[4:18:20] <%Remery_> Face it Pat, you are Abobo's girlfriend now. :)
[4:18:28] <+TheCrazyOutlaw> I got it for PC, but i still really want it on the Switch. Th idea of being able to take this anywhere sounds like a joy~
[4:18:33] <%Dr00_PhD> Hit confirm the dab with a light
[4:18:33] <%AppleBasket> Pat and Abobo
[4:18:33] <RyuuAoi> Okay that's kinda bs....
[4:18:35] <otakon17> I think it's time to call it a night on this and grind a bit
[4:18:36] <%AppleBasket> sitting in a tree
[4:18:44] <Saltmeisterr> @otakon17 is the switch version compromised?
[4:18:51] <%brickwall35> Pat is doing worse each attempt
[4:18:55] <exileshadow03> Don't scrub it, only villains do that
[4:19:00] <otakon17> @Saltmeisterr most definitely
[4:19:03] <xeros720> alternatively, go get Godai's mission and do that for money
[4:19:07] <Saltmeisterr> oof
[4:19:11] <otakon17> No way the Switch is running ANYTHING at 60FPS
[4:19:12] <+Adriangabs> Dab on that hater
[4:19:13] <AlexanderTheConquerer> pat is stuck thinking the dab is, like, a strong move
[4:19:15] <+broaches> literally getting dabbed on LUL
[4:19:19] <RyuuAoi> Dab it out!
[4:19:22] <CalciteCandy> Lame it out like it's X Tekkan
[4:19:25] <otakon17> YOU CAN DO IT PAT!
[4:19:25] <+TheCrazyOutlaw> Nah, ya gotta scrub this fight. Pats doing the right tactics here

[4:19:34] <Saltmeisterr> yeah but this should have been fine
[4:19:35] <TheCrook92> dab StinkyCheese
[4:19:35] <xeros720> it is just side Heavy, it's not that great except for knockback
[4:19:43] <otakon17> THE POWER OF THE DAB COMPELS YOU
[4:19:46] <Onmi_Khaos> Pat this is Phase 1, you've never struggled with phase 1
[4:19:50] <+DonnyJaBronie> I cant believe how strong the dab is here

[4:32:49] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> You can get it up to the point you get it.
[4:32:52] <%rdark_ksu> I thought chicken pox as an adult was shingles?
[4:32:53] <%JJCheeker> Try telling that to anti vax

[4:33:10] <%MegboyManuel> my mom never vaccinated me
[4:33:11] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat Shingles is technically a variant on the same virus and it's more painful than itchy. But also itchy. And it lasts longer.
[4:33:13] <+Ell1ot> Shingles suck. i know someone that got it in their eye
[4:33:15] <%brickwall35> my brother got shingles in his early 20s
[4:33:15] <%AnthroMetal> SHINGLES SUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCKS
[4:33:16] <%ElenaManetta> Doctors don't tell me these things, they just say "here's the vaccine now go away"

[4:33:58] <$The_Lady_Alustriel> monkaS
[4:33:58] <+Ell1ot> only 40-50 years
[4:33:58] <%Ion_Laser> well shit
[4:34:00] <%ElenaManetta> I don't like this new educational Pat stream format
[4:34:01] <+RETROxRELOADED> I'm itching...
[4:34:04] <%ElenaManetta> Where he tells me things I dont wanna hear
[4:34:09] <%Anime_Flux> hahahaha
[4:34:09] <RyuuAoi> And most likely die...
[4:34:09] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Is there any way to re up that shit>?
[4:34:09] <%waltzqueen> ITCHY TASTY
[4:34:10] <%JJCheeker> Well at least you had 4050 good years
[4:34:10] <+HeyBoston> NOT ME THOUGH I GET TO GET THAT THING EVERY DECADE IN THE SERVICE
[4:34:10] <%AncelDeLambert> that's why BOOSTER SHOTS EXIST
[4:34:11] <%corepool> god im so itchy now
[4:34:13] <%worldbrand> Now tell them about accidental myiasis!
[4:34:13] <%RubberFistFight> @jou_star no, don't do that. That's reckless, irresponsible and cruel. Better options exist, like the VACCINE.
[4:34:16] <%zamzoph> @AngriestPat Did you get your Smallpox vaccine again?
[4:34:17] <otakon17> DRIVE AWAY
[4:34:17] <%cylish> Thats why its such a big issue when antivaxers showed up
[4:34:21] <%PlainSimpleTailor> BURN THEM
[4:34:25] <ShichiNoBushi> Anti-vaxers are stupid.
[4:34:25] <%DexteraXIII> Or catch cowpox
[4:34:27] <%JJCheeker> What about anthrax
[4:34:28] <$Dutchpotato> burn them at the stake
[4:34:29] <%cylish> they are putting tons of other people at risk
[4:34:31] <otakon17> yeah vaccines are STILL important evenif they don't last forever
[4:34:31] <%Dakuu75> tell all the anti-vaxers to go play at their house
[4:34:31] <%filialpails> SMALLPOX STOLE MY TREE
[4:34:31] <+Estuko> Do it like in the Crazies
[4:34:33] <%SGrim> @AngriestPat I prefer to follow Milan's example.
[4:34:34] <%Typhaeon> Well, guess I'll look forward to my inevitable death
[4:34:34] <Tennochief> Time for a good old fashion lynching
[4:34:35] <disflipmat> I thought smallpox was all but eliminated from the planet
[4:34:36] <+HeyBoston> smallpox is p bad yeah

[4:34:43] <%ElenaManetta> I literally treated it like Mr. Burns "I'm invincible"
[4:34:45] <+HeyBoston> "modern"
