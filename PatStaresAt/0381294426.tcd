[0:08:49] <Fujiwara_92> crackdown and anthem pat
[0:08:49] <CrimsonFox777> I wouldn't know, it's NOT ON STEAM
[0:08:49] <%InsaneJackLondon> No idea
[0:08:50] <%Mr_Strut> Which one?
[0:08:50] <Prevot> fuck the Epic Store tho
[0:08:50] <SubjectX07x> It's top tier
[0:08:50] <%Freelance7> Metro is great so far.
[0:08:50] <%anhero17> Metro looks great
[0:08:50] <Gameslayer2> Looks good
[0:08:51] <%SirG005E> maybe?
[0:08:51] <SomeAsianDood> It's pretty good, epic client is a bitch though
[0:08:51] <FirearmsInstructor> Metro is amazing. One of my favorite games.
[0:08:51] <+Dogfootjoe> you need a redbull
[0:08:52] <gustavozxd> first two metros are good at least
[0:08:52] <%sshen> Anthem, jump force, far cry, metro, crackdown 3
[0:08:52] <NariaNagisa> Your dick?
[0:08:53] <conflict1914> Metro needs you to install Epic Game Store so fuck it
[0:08:54] <+ThatGuyfromMars> metro looked badass
[0:08:54] <+DK_Rance> anthem came out lol ?
[0:08:55] <lloyddboy> @AngriestPat dunno if you've heard, but the infinite knife doesn't negate S+ runs
[0:08:55] <dekkitout> better than far cry at least
[0:08:56] <theInkShow> boo
[0:08:57] <+SimplyPandaz> Its epic exclusive so im obligated to say fuck metro
[0:08:58] <Gruhunchously> Wait, Anthem came out?
[0:08:58] <+thackattack00> doesnt matter if metro is good
[0:08:58] <Zebroneath> I forgot Anthem existed again.
[0:08:59] <Angry_Ev1L> Anthem is bad
[0:08:59] <+gogorobotz> yay!
[0:08:59] <%TheGreatBamBe> Metros good, but you should probably play all the redux gaems
[0:09:00] <+michingmallecho> metro is good anneNote
[0:09:00] <%SinisterWang> Isn't Metro on the epic store?
[0:09:00] <%FrankClassic> Far Cry New Vegas?
[0:09:01] <artoflec> Hi Pat elaWOW
[0:09:02] <+chaumiester> Its plays like a less clunky Fallout 4
[0:09:03] <zafooru> so bioware is dead now right
[0:09:03] <Gruhunchously> Shy is the best
[0:09:04] <%Raxus_Secundus> Poor Anthem, choosing to die this weekend
[0:09:04] <Sedrelic> fuck the publishers..but its ok
[0:09:06] <%Freelance7> Metro is great so far, man!
[0:09:06] <%Ahack13> I Anthem, out? I literally have no idea.
[0:09:06] <+ThatGuyfromMars> and they used massive attack for a trailer so that's even more badass
[0:09:07] <Gameslayer2> Anthem comes out 22 i guess
[0:09:10] <DirtyPopcornJ> Epic is fine.
[0:09:11] <+Mr_Pylon> metro better than the other 2
[0:09:12] <%Harawanagangsta> Pay EA money: The Official Game
[0:09:13] <Xiangchang> Huh! I don't remember Jump Force looking like this, talk about a dark-toned looking game.
[0:09:14] <theInkShow> Dont support Metro
[0:09:14] <+robert_edwards> I'd watch a Metro stream
[0:09:16] <%AirlineFood74> @AngriestPat no it doesn't you can play it on consoles
[0:09:18] <DrkJP520> Anthem came out??/
[0:09:19] <bit_guardian> love Shy.
[0:09:22] <stabbityrabbit> "Oh Anthem came out." Kinda sums it all up, doesn't it?
[0:09:22] <%AlopekisPup> Metro is an awesome franchise. I'd get it on PS4 if you aren't wanting to do the whole Epic thing though.
[0:09:23] <gimmickypizza> Metro hype
[0:09:24] <+gogorobotz> More like stupid game store
[0:09:26] <@PlagueOfGripes> Anthem isn't out, so much as it's in the stupid subscription-only pre-release
[0:09:27] <%SinisterWang> Anthem is out for origin access nerds only right meow
[0:09:30] <Skatedeandre> I think anthem is out if you have ea access or some shit
[0:09:32] <%SirG005E> epic game store = non starter sorry
[0:09:35] <%t2381> Didn't crackdown come out as well?
[0:09:35] <%Spydurman> Metro looks cool
[0:09:38] <TheBlankAce> Anthem barely exists
[0:09:38] <SomeAsianDood> @Xiangchang ha, there's even well acted cutscenes, no one saw that coming
[0:09:41] <Gruhunchously> So, does that mean we get to start the Bioware death clock?

[0:09:55] <LevelClear> It's super hard!
[0:09:59] <%Graywolf_the_45th> Did you see that they had to slap stickers with the EPIC logo on the back of the box of Metro because all the boxes already had steam on them?

[0:25:43] <%Rngiddion> everyone wants to look at boobs
[0:25:44] <+KillScottKill> is Paige the gay?
[0:25:45] <+CausticLich> EVO has gotten far from its roots
[0:25:45] <%galaxyswirl> only the EVO US stream got pulled, not the japanese stream
[0:25:46] <%TheDullaMAN> Boobs are the best thing to ever see ever.

[0:25:58] <gustavozxd> it's doa ffs
[0:25:58] <DirtyPopcornJ> Oh no! A Boob!
[0:25:58] <%Raxus_Secundus> I mean, boobs are pretty great
[0:25:59] <inz0mbiac> Boobs are fun, it's why you call them fun bags
[0:26:02] <+thatonestraightman> Shirtless Leon fighting shirtless mr x in the rain
[0:26:02] <doctor_be> Breasts are a human experience, we all were babies once
[0:26:03] <+Nomicro4u> It wasn't corporate it was about being progressive
[0:26:04] <Psykoknight65> @angriestpat he also deleted the tweet after it blew up
[0:26:04] <SchroedingersFerret> @KillScottKill Paige is the bi
[0:26:06] <OwlLightningMage> Yes it is Pat LUL
[0:26:06] <+JustToWatch> you can look at many boobs online
[0:26:08] <%lewdskeletor13> KappaPride
[0:26:11] <Kathariya> ***
[0:26:15] <%HentaiSenpai9K> Boobs and Vagene are my religion
[0:26:16] <%FrostMass22> Fuck corporate point of view: they're disillusioned from what the consumer wants
[0:26:20] <OwlLightningMage> He apologized for scaring away the sponsors LUL
[0:26:22] <ScreamingMeat> Boobs are great. Why does everyone have to hide the tiddies?
[0:26:24] <%PanicSwytch> Boobs are a mutually accepted gift
[0:26:25] <+TQuick101> so then it is a business standpoint?
[0:26:25] <+KillScottKill> @SchroedingersFerret I know, referring to one of my favorite Pat laughing fits ever
[0:26:28] <silvcrest> No it isn't hard, its just dumb
[0:26:31] <dsauce999> BUT IT WAS FOR DOA
[0:26:32] <gustavozxd> it's just dumb, not that deep Paige
[0:26:33] <%CerberusDriver> Paige isnt really getting it
[0:26:34] <%ElenaManetta> If no one complained, then who are they apologizing for?
[0:26:35] <Alseid> NEVER apologize
[0:26:36] <dekkitout> its tricky tricky tricky TRICKY!
[0:26:38] <SailingSaturn> I just think its tacky thats all cirTan
[0:26:38] <CptBritches> No, they weren't doing anything actually offensive
[0:26:43] <Necrobern> BabyRage
[0:26:44] <+CausticLich> tecmo probably pissed they lost cash on those tiddies
[0:26:44] <%lewdskeletor13> DOA is nothing but tits
[0:26:48] <CptBritches> They were having fun and enjoying themselves
[0:26:48] <DatAsuna> BTW if you want their names look up yukakura moti
[0:26:49] <Ion_LaserX> Evo wanted none of that corporate TNA
[0:26:49] <Bouldus> hey guys
[0:26:51] <%galaxyswirl> whats even better is DOA toned it down kinda
[0:26:52] <%SirG005E> its kind of a backwards situation ya
[0:26:52] <DatAsuna> or yoshidha saki
[0:26:54] <BanSenpai> But i came for the titties
[0:26:57] <+Nomicro4u> They didn't want to "offend anyone"
[0:27:02] <SchroedingersFerret> @KillScottKill Damn I remember that one now
[0:27:03] <aimlesshealer> Her ears perk up at "cleavage" LUL
[0:27:05] <fairore> that's what I came for
[0:27:06] <+Manjoume> Mr. Wizard's response is business based. Hyper violence > sexuality = FGC Current Year. This is why we lost Mike Ross.
[0:27:07] <timetraveller2000> So this dlc is pretty good so far. Kappa
[0:27:08] <%around_40_jobbers> who doesn't like anime tiddies?
[0:27:08] <%FrostMass22> DOA is gonna kill itself by toning it down
[0:27:08] <+boomstickery> its all the jiggle physics
[0:27:10] <didgereedoodah> not really
[0:27:10] <Ion_LaserX> Especially the volleyball

[0:27:15] <%GarbageNirvana> Bi disaster Paige over here
[0:27:18] <CaptainFrankincense> evo got jealous of more attractive women clearly
[0:27:19] <TheBlankAce> This is par for the course for Japanese advertising TGS does stuff like this all the time
[0:27:19] <ScreamingMeat> EVO should just terll Sony and whoever else to either let them show the boobs or fuck off
[0:27:20] <%GrimLaughter> I just played this it's hard as fuck
[0:27:21] <LastKingSteve> No Sex as women are against core value, only VIOLENCE is allowed here!!!!!!
[0:27:21] <doctor_be> Dead or Alive might as well be a Senran Kagura fighting game
[0:27:22] <%Remery_> oh yes the beloved softening gel
[0:27:25] <TikanZK> that volleyball creepy anime bullshit is the reason i own a ps4
[0:27:25] <%Skrypto> what if they cut away from Bepis?
[0:27:25] <+ssulcer> TITTIES will always make more money than NO TITTIES
[0:27:26] <stabbityrabbit> DoA is going to have fun with EVO. It's a good fighting game covered in creepy anime boobs.
[0:27:27] <%FrostMass22> Fuck Sony
[0:27:28] <$shurtal> her mind went "into" the cleavage
[0:27:29] <%TheDullaMAN> Creepy Anime Titties > Realistive Clawed Flesh and Intestines
[0:27:30] <Prevot> how many thousand dollars of DLC will this DoA have?

[0:27:50] <gustavozxd> @doctor_be there's senean kagura dlc for doa5 and doa dlc for senran kagura so LUL
[0:27:51] <+CausticLich> only reason DOA exists is to sell tiddie costumes
[0:27:52] <DirtyPopcornJ> "Hey Tecmo! What do you think your doing letting these women play around in your titty game photo mode!? You only let the titty's flow while they fight!"
[0:27:53] <+dudecool61> Cut the ad mid stream LUL
[0:27:56] <giggedy> I just saw the footage wtf that was nothing

[0:28:14] <%FracturedImage> the internet doesnt forget

[0:28:16] <Brainworm205> Wow Ghost Survivors looks G R E A T
[0:28:18] <+redanimator> MK 11 got refuse release in japan
[0:28:20] <%Heatonist> Damn, doubling back on their double back? What bitches.
[0:28:21] <+nooshy1> What's even funnier is that every time a Evo channel went on break last night, they would play this live action One Piece ad, that had a Nami with AMAZING...personality...
[0:28:23] <%GohanEgret> @AngriestPat check kotaku, it has it all there
[0:28:23] <TheBlankAce> Yeah Wiz did a big coward
[0:28:28] <DirtyPopcornJ> Of course.
[0:28:28] <doctor_be> Gore in japan is a big no no
[0:28:28] <ShichiNoBushi> That's Japanese values. They are more lenient with sexuality but don't appreciate gore and violence.
[0:28:31] <CptBritches> GORE GOOD BOOB BAD
[0:28:32] <%Raxus_Secundus> What are talking about Pat. DoA is the pinnacle of fighting game technology. How dare you insult its nuanced mechanics by saying its only selling point is its aesthetically pleasing women
[0:28:33] <+cvp5127> wimps
[0:28:36] <@PlagueOfGripes> We would like to apologize for any offensive erections we caused with our fucking awesome fun bag simulation. Sorry, America!

[0:59:29] <%Skeleton_Boner_Lord> How can Lickers hear anything in the rain?

[0:59:50] <%Ahack13> well that went better than last time
[1:00:01] <%MyDarkStorm> Oh BOI
[1:00:02] <%AlopekisPup> @Shin0bus_ Nope. Though I think there is a timer like with The 4th Survivor. You don't have to beat it in a specific time, but it'll tell you how long you took. There's also unlockable things that you probably get from beating in certain times.
[1:00:06] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Who's the other ghost survivor besides Kendo?
[1:00:07] <tri3dgE027> Ooooo
[1:00:11] <timetraveller2000> BTW I think these dlcs take 15 mins on average first time.
[1:00:11] <gustavozxd> oh my God Pat using the knife on downed zombies makes me so angry

[1:00:28] <tri3dgE027> That's where we 'all headed
[1:00:32] <%CubicPhantom> can you target the backpack on item zombies specifically? to avoid having to fully kill them
[1:00:34] <+jjgamez64> I also took Magnum rounds
[1:00:35] <Prevot> the white zombies are a better version of the revelations monsters

[1:00:57] <+LethargicRush> you escaped!
[1:01:02] <tri3dgE027> @CubicPhantom You can leg-shot them, it counts as a down and it will bring down the pack
[1:01:02] <KeystoneA1> bad strat
[1:01:02] <Valdorick> Ah yes, I remember the orphanage, it had everything - Evil nurses. Evil wardens. 3 square meals a day. That nice cook that disappeared. THE BULLET MACHINE.
[1:01:02] <hbkman24> You could get a grenade and toss that before they aggro
[1:01:06] <%RioGascar> @angriestpat trick is to run by the dogs and focus on zombie backpack man
[1:01:06] <mr_mister0> the trick is to dodge the zambodogs like RE4 Leon
[1:01:06] <%GohanEgret> @nademonkey1100 I see you are a person of taste
[1:01:07] <EVOriginal> WHO'S ROMPING?
[1:01:11] <+dustingunn> you can just run and shoot the backpack guy a few times, grab the key and go
[1:01:13] <Thalchampz> yeah i think grenade would be more useful
[1:01:15] <Synchroscheme> bad trade
[1:01:15] <MayShip> the trick is to avoid everything
[1:01:16] <%Laecerelius> I'd imagine the grenades would be really good

[1:01:17] <chza> LUL
[1:01:21] <Thalchampz> cheevo tho!

[1:01:24] <The_Sorrow_> chiev pop
[1:01:24] <starlitalpha> why
[1:01:25] <%Konquerer> you can knife the zombo in 3 hits before he gets up and snag the key
[1:01:26] <Gruhunchously> Surprise achievement
[1:01:27] <+MyJoJob> the trick is probably pop a magnum on backpack zombo, take the key, and book it
[1:01:28] <OwlLightningMage> These dogs seems shitty to fight
[1:01:32] <%GohanEgret> apatJpeg
[1:01:35] <Plague_bagel> imagine looking out side and seeing som lady fighting dogs with just a knife
[1:01:35] <gustavozxd> I'd rather take the hits instead of wasting ammo
[1:01:36] <%CommanderSqueaks> Can you run up the slide?
[1:01:38] <timetraveller2000> And there are mr raccoons.
[1:01:40] <%SirG005E> i like music they have for this
[1:01:44] <%Ahack13> Doig are the worst thing in the game to fight.
[1:01:45] <$Tuskor13> You ever stab a dog in the neck as it tries to chomp your face off? It's just like skeet shooting.
[1:01:46] <+spi1211> pat u dookie at dis
[1:01:47] <%AlopekisPup> @timetraveller2000 Yes. They're silver.
[1:01:48] <%GohanEgret> slide like in RE6 @AngriestPat
[1:01:49] <%Gogogolem> Why is pat playing a girl dressed like she's going to shoot a porn?

[1:02:54] <%nademonkey1100> @GohanEgret the only way this would be better is thigh highs
[1:02:55] <starlitalpha> flash
[1:02:55] <%AirlineFood74> FUEL
[1:02:56] <+ThatGuyfromMars> always mag rounds
[1:02:56] <DirtyPopcornJ> you try modeling that effectively
[1:02:57] <draggy2140> zamby cats give less of a fuck about humans than living ones
[1:02:57] <+CausticLich> get those
[1:02:57] <%AirlineFood74> GAMER GUEL
[1:02:58] <KeystoneA1> Fuel
[1:03:00] <%patriotrenegade> zombie cats would be too lazy
[1:03:00] <+countgaculatv> Get the Flash
[1:03:01] <Geno4344> zombie elmo that kicks you with nice feet (beep beep) when
[1:03:01] <OwlLightningMage> Big choices
[1:03:02] <MayShip> too fast small hurtboxes bad time
[1:03:02] <Gruhunchously> @Skrypto I'd just turn the game off
[1:03:03] <Huntercd> Zombie cats would not give a fuck
[1:03:03] <$Mendin> Flash Grenade to own all three lickers at once?
[1:03:06] <+DeaconBluesClues> @Mendin toxoplasmosis exists wtf are you talking about LUL
[1:03:06] <%Skrypto> LUL
[1:03:06] <Valdorick> Cats are already too evil for the T-virus to infect them. I mean shit - look at the cats on the zombie ship in Warframe.
[1:03:07] <timetraveller2000> Zombie cats for RE3 remake.
[1:03:07] <%mastertwin2> INB4 those machines are adaptive difficulty LUL
[1:03:08] <EVOriginal> Big bad
[1:03:09] <$soupjunkie> cats infected with the t-virus turn out to be exactly the same as normal cats
[1:03:10] <KeystoneA1> Should've grabbed the frag for this part though
[1:03:11] <%RioGascar> @angriestpat flash the bus and run by
[1:03:12] <Garry_Guyface> Kite them you dingus
[1:03:14] <ChineseNininga> @skrypto there was actually a scrapped idea for zombie cats the original RE2
[1:03:15] <%CommanderSqueaks> Did Pat just light himself on Fire?
[1:03:17] <Valdorick> Fuckers live just eating zombies and don't get infect.
[1:03:17] <fluqqer3d> hit your juul, payt
[1:03:18] <%AirlineFood74> @Mendin you can stomp the lickers with the flamethrower tho
[1:03:18] <gustavozxd> I take the flash to grab the "secret" key later
[1:03:20] <Kghaleon> flash grenade would help with lickers
[1:03:28] <Kalcom> would it?
[1:03:30] <%MyDarkStorm> Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm
[1:03:31] <%AlopekisPup> Don't really have to waste ammo on these guys.
[1:03:31] <%zephyr201> I can only imagine Outbreak File 1 and 2 in the RE Engine
[1:03:33] <Fluxraw> This is Hot Kappa
[1:03:34] <%GohanEgret> @nademonkey1100 too true
[1:03:35] <Gruhunchously> Ammo. Conserve it
[1:03:37] <gustavozxd> you can just avoid the lickers completely
[1:03:37] <%AirlineFood74> WASTED ammo
[1:03:41] <EVOriginal> Flash grenade would blind the blind things
[1:03:41] <tri3dgE027> RIP ammo...
[1:03:42] <%king_wragles> So I left for da bathroom... why is Pat playing a flamethrower wielding, nighty wearing co-ed?
[1:03:44] <arfsm95> who's that?
[1:03:46] <KeystoneA1> @AngriestPat Not to backseat game but that flamer works real well on a certain enemy.

[1:04:08] <T_Sasquatch> BLIND
[1:04:08] <Centurybomber> using a flamethrower when it's raining. lol
[1:04:08] <%AlopekisPup> That flamer is really powerful against living things.

[1:04:43] <$MajorCrasher> BACKPACK?!
[1:04:43] <%AlopekisPup> @CybertronPrime I don't believe so.
[1:04:44] <%GeneralSCPatton> I imagine that flamethrower is really powerful, especially against regenerating things.
[1:04:48] <SailingSaturn> @mccann_2018 the pale heads? no
[1:04:50] <%king_wragles> Where? Fucking WHERE did she just put that flamethrower?!!
[1:04:50] <%AlopekisPup> @blackbeaking Yup

[1:04:52] <%patriotrenegade> @AngriestPat Max could do this
[1:04:58] <DrMoose7> its been a long night
[1:04:58] <Garry_Guyface> Zambo is an actual racist term btw
[1:05:00] <%CommanderSqueaks> I wonder if using the flamethrower in the bus will be more effective than using it outside, in the rain?
[1:05:00] <+LethargicRush> dont worry about it
[1:05:01] <Prevot> I'd still hit it
[1:05:02] <%SaltyDongs> Heal mayhaps

[1:15:46] <%AlopekisPup> @Sphincter_Spelunker If you're grabbed from the side by a zombie, move in the opposite direction of where the zombie grabbed you (grabbed on the right, move left and vice versa) and he'll push them off. Only works if you're grabbed on the side though.

[1:18:58] <%WheatlyXT> walked right past ammo
[1:19:02] <mr_mister0> gernade launcher explosions don't hurt you
[1:19:03] <ScreamingMeat> Kendo makes unintentionally hilarious faces in the intro
[1:19:07] <DrkJP520> Back up toward the explody zombie to see the licker come in
[1:19:08] <%Tokanova> here we GO
[1:19:08] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> @AngriestPat If they remade RE3 would you want it to be standalone or RE2 DLC?
[1:19:09] <thehoboacrossts> wait so is ghost survivors canon??
[1:19:14] <%AirlineFood74> @Clik404 never noticed it in truth
[1:19:14] <%Tokanova> Jebaited
[1:19:15] <timetraveller2000> He got the racoon!
[1:19:15] <ScreamingMeat> No
[1:19:15] <GameXful2> NO
[1:19:17] <+DoctorDerp388> Rise of Fat Hero
[1:19:17] <%RioGascar> @angriestpat this shit dont fuck around. good news tho. Tested it and explosions do no damage. doesnt even drop from fine to “less fine”.
[1:19:17] <%fredan31> @TheApostles101 how do i gift you
[1:19:18] <+ThatGuyfromMars> no @thehoboacrossts
[1:19:21] <%AirlineFood74> @thehoboacrossts big no
[1:19:23] <mr_mister0> SourPls
[1:19:23] <%CommanderSqueaks> So, basically these modes turn the game into RE4?
[1:19:25] <+black_pariah> So pat is both deaf and blind
[1:19:27] <%AlopekisPup> @thehoboacrossts No. They're "what if" scenarios.
[1:19:28] <%LethargicRush> no if it WAS canon he'd have a crossbow
[1:19:28] <%SmoochSpider> SourPls
[1:19:29] <todcomod> I wonder if they'll actually make a randomizer?
[1:19:29] <%Graywolf_the_45th> Ghost survivors is a bunch of "what if" stories
[1:19:29] <%legendscar01> Sick beat
[1:19:30] <+DoctorDerp388> it's totally canon
[1:19:31] <+8framelag> yet
[1:19:31] <Madbearv> its free content
[1:19:34] <%RioGascar> @angriestpat but it does knock your ass down. So it has its balances
[1:19:36] <thehoboacrossts> :( aw i was hoping Kendo lived
[1:19:37] <%Swish19XX> Is it headshots that pop the purple haze or kills in general
[1:19:38] <DirtyPopcornJ> this is all "What if..."
[1:19:39] <dsauce999> SourPls
[1:19:39] <%galaxyswirl> watch them go its super canon now
[1:19:42] <%Skeleton_Boner_Lord> Mr. Raccoon hates Red Bull and that is why he must die
[1:19:42] <piggypig> the second 2 are totally not canon
[1:19:43] <Dakuu75> it's head-canon
[1:19:44] <%Graywolf_the_45th> Except Kendo, he totally made it out
[1:19:44] <Geno4344> what if jetpack zombies
[1:19:45] <%AirlineFood74> @Swish19XX kills I think
[1:19:45] <Synchroscheme> Tofu is the true canon
[1:19:46] <Gray_skies1993> the time has come and so have I
[1:19:48] <piggypig> the kendo one has a shot at being canon
[1:19:50] <+HoloToast> It's not canon because otherwise it would mean that Ben fucks
[1:19:50] <+ThatGuyfromMars> not really @CommanderSqueaks it's more like an arcade mode
[1:19:51] <mr_mister0> It's not RE4 if you can't roundhouse a Zamno
[1:19:52] <%AirlineFood74> you can shoot them in the head just fine
[1:19:53] <Naixoram> this theme is banging
[1:19:53] <devanmuse> Did he do any of the other Ghost Survivor missions yet? Or is this the first?
[1:19:54] <suikudo> Watch they make it canon
[1:19:54] <Valdorick> You mean the police chief wasn't knocked out and the Mayor's daughter didn't run away with headcrushed McGee?
[1:19:54] <%Corporate_Redeemer> I wish Kendo's was canon :(
[1:19:55] <+TheImmortal70> The mayor one couldn't possibly be canon because she literally changes plot
[1:19:56] <%MyDarkStorm> @AngriestPat I Missed you saying excuse me in Evil within
[1:19:57] <Madbearv> Pat are you gonna take the offer of free real estate in Raccoon City?
[1:19:58] <AlasterAngelo> they actually confirmed that this is the new canon
[1:20:00] <timetraveller2000> Wonder if they’ll do canon prequel dlc for Marvin?
[1:20:01] <%AirlineFood74> @devanmuse katherine's run
[1:20:02] <Bloodworks12> The soldier one could be canon
[1:20:02] <%AlopekisPup> Tofu, Flan ending is the canon one.
[1:20:03] <%Tokanova> TIME LIMIT
[1:20:04] <Heyestus> Tofu Squad > STARS
[1:20:04] <%hawk_rush> they should have a gamemode where you play as mr. x

[1:20:11] <starlitalpha> GOOD!

[1:20:48] <thehoboacrossts> Idk if it's just me but I feel like the Survivor games should be remaked in a sense because they seemed pretty underated. The controls were just kinda bad
[1:20:49] <%AlopekisPup> @Bloodworks12 That's definitely the most likely one. We do have to assume that there was another survivor that they just didn't know about.

[1:28:14] <%AlopekisPup> @RioGascar I feel like it would almost be a bad thing to add it to the main game since there's enough ammo around that you'll likely regret tossing it later. Just put it in the item box.

[1:31:58] <%AlopekisPup> @RioGascar Plus, if I'm right, you can ignore every weapon in the game except your starting one. So a knife only run without opening the item box shouldn't be that hard. You'll just be down one item slot or you could just decide to open it once at the beginning to put that gun away and then never again.

[1:53:57] <%RioGascar> @angriestpat he can still grab you and do damage. It just does from fine to less fine
[1:54:04] <DirtyPopcornJ> Go Chunk go!
[1:54:06] <KeystoneA1> @ShadowZiggy He can but not as much damage
[1:54:07] <%GeneralSCPatton> @firearmsinstructor He reminds me of that high-ranking military officer who repeatedly slammed himself into a wall hoping to phase through it, because atoms are mostly empty space.
[1:54:09] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @timetraveller2000 This is called Volume 1
[1:54:21] <+x24sonic> BIG smart
[1:54:24] <timetraveller2000> Sequel confirmed Kreygasm

[1:54:38] <+tigerfang86> NICE JOB
[1:54:38] <%AlopekisPup> @timetraveller2000 I think they said this was volume 1, so I'd say it's pretty much a guarantee that there will be more.
[1:54:39] <+8framelag> no knife

[1:56:06] <%Konquerer> too bad all that body armor doesn't do shit against human teeth
[1:56:07] <Dakuu75> he's conserving his ammo like there's gonna be a big boss at the end or something
[1:56:07] <%AlopekisPup> @timetraveller2000 Oh yeah. A Marvin DLC would be amazing. I really want a story one that kind of focuses on what he was doing before Leon and Claire show up. Though that's probably asking for too much. lol
[1:56:08] <Gruhunchously> Wow
[1:56:08] <DirtyPopcornJ> Don't get hit ez
[1:56:09] <+HoloToast> people shittalking PC for no reason in 3, 2, 1...
[1:56:09] <+x24sonic> holy shit, not dying is a really good idea you should try that
[1:56:09] <%Svanyr> People killed when they are die
[1:56:11] <starlitalpha> not dying is overrated
[1:56:14] <%RioGascar> @angriestpat do you find it odd theres no marvin ghost survivor DLC? They could do a cabin style thing with the RPD lobby with him
[1:56:16] <LuisKingKing> Let Elmo play
[1:56:16] <CrimsonFox777> Give it a shot then. I hear it's a decent strategy.
[1:56:25] <madhattergay> Pat have u tried asking nicely?
[1:56:25] <+AXL808> damn, i forgot about the stream until now. is this Pat's first character for ghost survivors?
[1:56:25] <Pookiedaexzile> Thats right get it in the fire
[1:56:25] <$The_CLaUD> @AngriestPat shotgun > Grenade launcher
[1:56:26] <%kewlmyc> Bodied

[1:56:39] <jobbedbone> BARA IS PURE
[1:56:42] <timetraveller2000> Although they did that already, it’s called RE Outbreak Kappa
[1:56:42] <KeystoneA1> There's one more after this
[1:56:43] <+ThatGuyfromMars> @AXL808 nah he did the mayor's daughter and kendo first
[1:56:49] <KaptainKappathe5th> its the most dangerous enemy in the game knifing it is so unintuitive it HAS to be intentional
[1:56:51] <+xxviios> If you hate it get a refund
[1:56:52] <%bread_assassin> Would this mode be better or worse if the items you can get from those dispensers were randomized?
[1:56:53] <+AXL808> damn
[1:56:55] <righteousjam> This EDM club is so hype...
[1:56:56] <+twohitgood> why not mup over flashbang?
[1:56:57] <timetraveller2000> But yeah, I agree
[1:56:58] <%AlopekisPup> @timetraveller2000 Oh yeah. I actually forgot that game existed. lol

[1:57:25] <KaptainKappathe5th> hawk
[1:57:26] <axelcezar> well, when you jump on and start shanking shit, usually is very effective

[1:57:42] <%AlopekisPup> @aiyobro lol
[1:57:44] <Gruhunchously> Shotgun 2: Fall of the Samurai
[1:57:47] <%RioGascar> @angriestpat i’d say dont bother with regular gunpowder if you dont grab handgun. the larges really do give you the OMPH boost
[1:57:49] <Worldbrand> It's time for the hellway
[1:57:52] <%MelBrooksKA> @aiyobro 3rd or 4th

[2:00:32] <%Corporate_Redeemer> Try to save the flash for the bridge
[2:00:32] <$The_CLaUD> @AngriestPat take the MUP this time
[2:00:33] <KeystoneA1> You can make 2 grenades by that point if you manage correctly
[2:00:34] <xeros720> any bets that is the last room?
[2:00:34] <+tigerfang86> Pat HATES getting shot
[2:00:35] <$Tuskor13> Bruh I don't think I can actually WATCH these deaths anymore, they're so damn brutal for the army dude
[2:00:35] <madhattergay> Chunk nooooooooo!
[2:00:36] <NicholasKane> shoot the gun
[2:00:37] <Reanimator83> It’s like Pat has never played this game before
[2:00:38] <Gruhunchously> You got fucked into the ground hitbox
[2:00:41] <SaltyBrim> Never shoot the gun. You need it for later
[2:00:42] <DirtyPopcornJ> But what if he needs that ammo later?
[2:00:43] <%AlopekisPup> @AXL808 Probably that prankster, Wayne Li.
[2:00:44] <%badchoice5> Using guns are just temporary buffs
[2:00:44] <+twohitgood> grab the spray instead of flashbang if you're just gonna use the flashbang to take a hit.
[2:00:46] <Worldbrand> the gunpowder on that zambambo probably makes clearing the bridge worth it
[2:00:52] <timetraveller2000> Feel like pats doing something wrong... like not making a grenade Kappa
[2:00:55] <+tigerfang86> NICE
[2:00:56] <%InsaneJackLondon> LUL
[2:00:57] <%Big_Dream> just use your runs i don't understand why you making it so hard on yourself @AngriestPat
[2:00:57] <%zerocruz> Chunk > All
[2:00:57] <FirearmsInstructor> xD love that nibble
[2:00:58] <CurrySauseBandit> That nibble LUL
[2:00:58] <%HentaiSenpai9K> Mommy why is the bald man so bad at games?
[2:00:58] <Teloss> take the magnum you can snipe like all the zombies there and you can make/get more ammo
[2:00:59] <$MajorCrasher> if you take the magnum and mup you can use all the gunpowder
[2:00:59] <Seedlesslad> bite through the face shield
[2:01:00] <TyrantSlime> just a little nibble
[2:01:01] <Wordless1412> Nibble
[2:01:01] <SeventyForce> Nommmm
[2:01:02] <aiyobro> chip damage
[2:01:02] <Shadicara> WOAH zombies drop loot??
[2:01:02] <Garry_Guyface> Remember, the game scores you on how many bullets you have and not if you survive to make it
[2:01:02] <+8framelag> just a nibble
[2:01:03] <KaptainKappathe5th> i love how that does no damage lol
[2:01:05] <$The_CLaUD> @xeros720 it's not, we still need to meet up with an old friend first
[2:01:07] <%RioGascar> @twohitgood If hes planning on using it on the plants...i’d say grab flash
[2:01:19] <gustavozxd> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[2:01:20] <%nictron90> Don't forget that those plants are an instant-death if you have no defense item though

[2:01:30] <KaptainKappathe5th> ASSERT DOMINANCE
[2:01:30] <+Piro_koeth> When that flash is gonna be needed for what's next
[2:01:31] <devanmuse> i still cant believe that works
[2:01:31] <pectusumbra> pat the hero
[2:01:31] <%AlopekisPup> Spray isn't going to protect you against Ivy.
[2:01:32] <%Konquerer> but plant dudes are an instant kill

[2:01:43] <%RioGascar> @angriestpat think carefully. If you use the bang to take the hit from the plant. Take the flash. BUT THAT SPRAY IS YOUR ONLY HEAL
[2:01:44] <joetomanek> I love pat
[2:01:44] <Shadicara> Knife is too powerful
[2:01:44] <Kalcom> If he's not gonna shoot them he should grab the spray
[2:01:46] <godzookylives> For all the body armor he's wearing he sure does take damage like a bitch
[2:01:47] <chambatron> Chew the gunpowder and spit it to the zombies
[2:01:50] <%MyDarkStorm> At Least Your not on a time limit

[2:03:26] <madhattergay> Chunk is just a babie
[2:03:26] <%KaironFortressKnight> Chunk is extra delicious to zombinos
[2:03:26] <DirtyPopcornJ> but you need it now
[2:03:26] <+ShikiHisashi> You'll be fine
[2:03:27] <Shadicara> Pat got chunk'd
[2:03:27] <mak0t0yukii> Make ammo
[2:03:28] <Centurybomber> lol
[2:03:28] <DracaenaLeaf> Maybe make some more later
[2:03:28] <+manwithboxonhead> Mortis indeed
[2:03:28] <Fluxraw> First: Get to later.
[2:03:29] <reonome> AT
[2:03:30] <%ScottishMadJacko> you couldve beaten this already if you'd actually kill
[2:03:30] <lloyddboy> JUST DON'T MISS
[2:03:31] <+ShikiHisashi> You'll have wnogh
[2:03:31] <suikudo> Come on show me ya S4!
[2:03:32] <CptBritches> What if you don't have enough life for later?
[2:03:32] <Gnuan> craft some grenades
[2:03:33] <EVOriginal> Won't be a later if you die now @AngriestPat
[2:03:33] <%badchoice5> Pat doesn't use temporary buffs like ammo or grenades
[2:03:33] <Dakuu75> face palms so hard it leaves a mark
[2:03:35] <tungstenviper> FIND OUT LATER
[2:03:36] <%GarbageNirvana> Later doesn't come if you're dead
[2:03:37] <+twohitgood> what was the item in the room he ignored?
[2:03:37] <AsinineWaffle> You need to get to "later" first.
[2:03:39] <privatesargent> having enough ammo for later doesn't matter if you can't get to later
[2:03:39] <pede2011> WHAT LATER, YOU SUCK NOW
[2:03:40] <+StromkoPenguin> What if having a health item in inventory bumped up the difficulty? That'd be so fked.
[2:03:40] <Kalcom> then you re do it later
[2:03:40] <+8framelag> survival horror hoarder
[2:03:41] <CurrySauseBandit> You literally get so much powder your throwing it away Pat LUL
[2:03:41] <SeventyForce> Yes, have no later and save for later!
[2:03:41] <$2Metronomes> But why does Pat go out of his way to die?
[2:03:41] <Gruhunchously> There won't be a later if you die
[2:03:41] <%Big_Dream> @AngriestPat you ocd is making thie much harder than it needs to be
[2:03:41] <$The_CLaUD> @AngriestPat you'll have more ammo if you take the MUP
[2:03:44] <%InsaneJackLondon> then that will be a valuable learning experience
[2:03:47] <Worldbrand> he loves the nibble
[2:03:48] <gamezerox> If you don't have ammo for later then you'll know you'll need more ammo
[2:03:49] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Would you just actually soot them where it might kill them fucking this leg shit
[2:03:49] <$MajorCrasher> why no take the MUP and Magnum
[2:03:50] <+HoloToast> that game mode is all about going through it using as little ammo as possible, it makes sense that you'd play like that while learning
[2:03:51] <%KaironFortressKnight> That fucking tiny bite is the funniest
[2:03:52] <$DesertPenguin09> You do realize game designers design around the idea of giving you more later when they think you'll have used everything so far?
[2:03:53] <mastermidget23> "Don't have to worry about later if I die right now!" -taps forehead.
[2:03:53] <SaltyBrim> Doesn’t matter if you die before that
[2:03:53] <axelcezar> he MUST conserve ammo! you guys just don't get it!....
[2:03:54] <%CubicPhantom> hey pat remember when you told Woolz this game was about math? Your math is bad, math better
[2:03:55] <%Jjrossman> USE an ETHER
[2:03:55] <starlitalpha> i dont wanna spend money in dead cells! I ll need it later!"
[2:03:56] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> What later? Get there first
[2:03:57] <Tucker0603> you always don't have enough room for the gunpowder smart one
[2:03:57] <%Konquerer> there won't be a later if you don't shoot the damn gun
[2:03:58] <Pookiedaexzile> Nah I think Pats right, Just run past it all
[2:03:58] <%RioGascar> @angriestpat consider this. flash bang can save your life from plants (if u use knife). BUT that first aid spray is your ONLY HEAL. so...choose wisely
[2:03:58] <$The_CLaUD> MUP
[2:04:02] <%zerocruz> Chunk > Hunk
[2:04:02] <%MyDarkStorm> Whens Later if your dead now
[2:04:05] <madhattergay> Nibble on chunk
[2:04:06] <jamesofn> @CurrySauseBandit the powder hes throwing away is only good for the handgun, so if he doesnt take the handgun its useless

[2:04:11] <+rcand9> zombies cant get enough of chunk
[2:04:12] <%AlopekisPup> @AngriestPat Save some ammo for the boss at the end.
[2:04:12] <%Tokanova> i'm glad there isn't a real time limit
[2:04:12] <Seedlesslad> Do lickers have assholes?
[2:04:13] <+Blargimazombie> Every item is a megalizer now, even bullets

[2:04:23] <%Laecerelius> Locker backdashes!
[2:04:25] <%Tomiko0> Ammo Conservation is the limiter put in place to stop Pat from beating this game in 4 seconds.
[2:04:25] <AlasterAngelo> do assholes have lickers
[2:04:25] <Ion_LaserX> PC Knife > Gun
[2:04:26] <AEnemyStandUser> man Hunk is so cool
[2:04:29] <suckasurprise> just got here, did pat beat the other 2 already
[2:04:30] <Gruhunchously> Chunk is a surprising appropriate name for this poor bastard
[2:04:31] <%zerocruz> apatBig SLASHO
[2:04:33] <%HentaiSenpai9K> PAT UN
[2:04:35] <%nictron90> I like how you worry about ammo so much that you leave gunpowder behind
[2:04:42] <%Konquerer> save everything for the 30 mr x and g3s at the end
[2:04:43] <$The_CLaUD> @suckasurprise yeah he did
[2:04:43] <jamesofn> that room seems to be RNG depending on what the zombies are doing when you walk in
[2:04:44] <KaptainKappathe5th> DAMMIT CHUNK
[2:04:46] <%RioGascar> @angriestpat if you wanna save bullets. With the licker dead you COULD knife the backpack man
[2:04:46] <SilentClyde> Pat, if you use all of your bullets early on, the zombies will underestimate you and stop double-teaming you. Then when you get weapons later you can kill them while they're off-guard.
[2:04:47] <axelcezar> when would you think that knifing a liker would actually be a thing
[2:04:51] <Pookiedaexzile> I didn't know This had voice controls Pat
[2:04:55] <%MelBrooksKA> @Seedlesslad They can have whatever you want spyCappa spyYum apatSmug
[2:04:56] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Sooooo New Vegas after or?
[2:04:58] <%badchoice5> Chunk's fat ass can't get up the ladder easily
[2:05:04] <madhattergay> Chunk is having the troubles
[2:05:10] <%Laecerelius> This exact bullshit is why Hunk was the real survivor and not you, Chunk!
[2:05:13] <%TheSpiritof2277> You're trying our patience Private Chunk
[2:05:14] <%Big_Dream> here we go again
[2:05:14] <Pookiedaexzile> No He's an Apex legends streamer now
[2:05:14] <%AlopekisPup> Pat. Stop getting hit.
[2:05:15] <%badchoice5> @Sphincter_Spelunker After what?
[2:05:18] <Gruhunchously> It's that time of the month for Chunk
[2:05:18] <Shadicara> Chunk gonna take a hunk out of those zambles
[2:05:20] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Raccoon
[2:05:21] <gustavozxd> damn very unluck
[2:05:23] <CrimsonFox777> Bad end
[2:05:29] <%Tomiko0> Nice Spot.
[2:05:30] <suckasurprise> I don't think Pat is going to be able to beat this one, if he does I'll eat my hat
[2:05:30] <NicholasKane> good eye!
[2:05:33] <+thackattack00> speaking of this game and voice controls, dude was on the front page this morning playing this with his feet and voice
[2:05:33] <+Zerodyne90> !uptime
[2:05:34] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 5m.
[2:05:38] <%RioGascar> @angriestpat so what i do is shotgun those 2 heads in the armor and run by
[2:05:40] <%Corporate_Redeemer> Save ammo for New Vegas later
[2:05:43] <RyanTheRecluse> Shotgun isn’t worth it without the extra damage from the extended barrel
[2:05:50] <%GeneralSCPatton> cheer500 These haters in the chat can't recognize a solid meta-strat when they see one. Clearly, Pat is trying to die with enough ammo to kill the grim reaper and become immortal.
[2:05:53] <%boxboten> @mods i subbed but havent recieved a discord inv
[2:05:54] <+Th3SmartAlec> YEAH JUST BEAT IT
[2:05:55] <CptBritches> Good eyes, now if you could just use those eyes to aim at the enemies and kill them
[2:06:01] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @badchoice5 After this? Only been an hour of game. After the Ruby Weapon hour of thanking people
[2:06:03] <fruit_pie_the_magician> like seriously, why the blatant charging directly into unstaggered zombies?
[2:06:04] <madhattergay> Chunk why cant ube more like your brother Hunk
[2:06:07] <OwlLightningMage> @GeneralSCPatton LUL
[2:06:11] <%SergeEXE> MAKE LOTTSA SPhAGETTI
[2:06:13] <%Laecerelius> Oooh
[2:06:15] <%KaironFortressKnight> Wait WHAT
[2:06:16] <%badchoice5> @Sphincter_Spelunker Bold of you to assume Pat will beat Chunk
[2:06:17] <Fujiwara_92> LUL
[2:06:17] <Ion_LaserX> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[2:06:18] <%Laecerelius> Handgrenade, huh?
[2:06:18] <CurrySauseBandit> It's fine
[2:06:18] <%Niney_Who> How does that
[2:06:19] <%Konquerer> yes it is
[2:06:19] <Lotharman> You can make grenades now?!
[2:06:20] <+HoloToast> hehehe
[2:06:21] <Gruhunchously> @GeneralSCPatton Isn't that how Dante's Inferno begins?
[2:06:22] <%nictron90> oh neat
[2:06:23] <+rcand9> Paige through a mistake made an awesome nickname for chunk
[2:06:24] <DrkJP520> G launcher is probably the best here
[2:06:25] <Shadicara> Nah chunk is really holding onto those bullets for later
[2:06:25] <gustavozxd> but that's what you should've done
[2:06:26] <%Laecerelius> That could be useful
[2:06:27] <Dakuu75> @RyanTheRecluse yeah, I agree. that's why in main game I'd try to save shotgun ammo UNTILL that upgrade. because it increases the value of shotgun
[2:06:28] <Pookiedaexzile> Does Pat get gangbanged Next room or no?
[2:06:28] <saberknight_> Adaptive difficulty?
[2:06:28] <CptBritches> But making a grenade was the best thing you could've done
[2:06:29] <+8framelag> well it will get past the plant
[2:06:31] <%AlopekisPup> @fruit_pie_the_magician Cause he's rushing like he's being timed instead of trying to finish it first and then try to improve his time.
[2:06:31] <FirearmsInstructor> nice jukes
[2:06:33] <Gray_skies1993> GOOD JUKS
[2:06:34] <CptBritches> HI MISTY :)
[2:06:34] <%Tomiko0> The Jukes!
[2:06:40] <$The_CLaUD> @RyanTheRecluse that's because shotgun isn't meant for range, you're SUPPOSED to let them get close and get a guaranteed head pop
[2:06:40] <Gray_skies1993> bad jukes
[2:06:41] <Gnuan> GRENDE
[2:06:43] <jamesofn> yes, definitely

[2:15:46] <Wordless1412> The Raccoon is so distracting
[2:15:48] <Enryuan> Is there a reason for the racoon ?
[2:15:49] <fluqqer3d> this is the run
[2:15:50] <neooneshin> Ok, so it's Hunk
[2:15:51] <%Corporate_Redeemer> CHUNK and Mini-CHUNK
[2:15:54] <madhattergay> Paige name ghost Chunk
[2:15:55] <neooneshin> Are these mods
[2:15:55] <dsauce999> CHONK
[2:15:56] <KaptainKappathe5th> THIS IS TOTALLY INTENTIONAl
[2:15:57] <DrkJP520> You avoided the nibbler. This is the one
[2:16:00] <dsauce999> !raffle
[2:16:00] <KeystoneA1> I mean they probably tested it so...
[2:16:00] <%AlopekisPup> @neooneshin Basically. It's one of his teammates.
[2:16:00] <+rcand9> is racooner piloting chunk?
[2:16:02] <KaptainKappathe5th> THERES NO WAY ITS NOT
[2:16:03] <ShichiNoBushi> @neooneshin "Chunk" is the nickname of this character Pat's currently playing.
[2:16:03] <+ThatGuyfromMars> can you do that in the main game tho
[2:16:03] <xeros720> if it was in the previous game, yes
[2:16:04] <Shadicara> Chunk and Chonk's leisurely stroll took a strange turn
[2:16:04] <DracaenaLeaf> DLCs
[2:16:06] <Sloavon> not a bug, a feature
[2:16:07] <+Ell1ot> how is there not a dark souls kick to knock over armless zombies?
[2:16:08] <+SimplyPandaz> chunk and chonk
[2:16:08] <%InsaneJackLondon> Its a "Feature"
[2:16:09] <Khorneflakes_> It must be, he's just there
[2:16:10] <%AlopekisPup> @Enryuan It's an unlock
[2:16:11] <+RC_S3kshun8> Does Pat not know knife damage is tied to frame rate? All the speedrunners use it to kill birkin
[2:16:11] <%ooblagis> You're doing a bunch more damage thanks to the FPS bug, so yes, it's unintentional
[2:16:11] <%MelBrooksKA> @Enryuan Just a costume
[2:16:14] <%TheSpiritof2277> it's totally meant to be in
[2:16:15] <+Th3SmartAlec> I don't know, the Lickers are bullshit enough that I believe it
[2:16:25] <neooneshin> So his real name is hunk?
[2:16:31] <CptBritches> No, they get stunlocked even at 60fps
[2:16:33] <%AlopekisPup> @neooneshin No. He's Ghost
[2:16:37] <+HoloToast> RC_S3kshun8 he's not talking about the damage, the knife staggers lickers by default
[2:16:38] <%nictron90> Regular also makes shotgun rounds (though I suppose you mostly want big for that)
[2:16:41] <TyrantSlime> His codename is Ghost
[2:16:42] <Gray_skies1993> Hunk is a codename for a different guy @neooneshin
[2:16:43] <neooneshin> Why does he have a raccoon on his head
[2:16:43] <Shadicara> Nah it's chunk and the racoon is chonk
[2:16:44] <%AlopekisPup> @neooneshin Hunk was his teammate.
[2:16:45] <+Ell1ot> This guy's real name is Honk
[2:16:47] <Guardiansaiyan> @neooneshin this guys name is CHUNK..Hunk is in 4th survivor
[2:16:47] <%MelBrooksKA> @neooneshin No, it's something stupid Paige siad

[2:17:04] <KaptainKappathe5th> holy fuck pat really
[2:17:06] <GameXful2> it's Ghost
[2:17:06] <%galaxyswirl> i believe thats a bug with the knife that makes it do infinite damage cause it does full headshot damage on every frame of the hit. so on PC it hits like tons of times or something stupid
[2:17:07] <nomad480> idiot

[2:25:34] <SpaceGuntank> 100 zombies with infinite ammo? that doesnt seem too hard...
[2:25:34] <Gray_skies1993> it's literally COD BLOPS
[2:25:35] <RomieDBG> yeah, why are the bodies exploding? lol

[2:25:37] <Fujiwara_92> KILL A 100 PogChamp
[2:25:37] <%SmoochSpider> At least infinte amo
[2:25:37] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> LUIS HELP
[2:25:38] <+Bowz1988> Too many handgun shots!!
[2:25:38] <ShichiNoBushi> That one zombie wearing Splinter Cell trinoculars?
[2:25:38] <%Typhaeon> Don't shoot, that's the guy from Doordash
[2:25:39] <%YaBoiShamoi> COD Zombies RE style
[2:25:42] <$The_CLaUD> @AngriestPat if you use less then 60 handgun bullets, you get a hat that gives you infinite ammo in all 4 modes
[2:25:45] <%RioGascar> @angriestpat hope you were taking notes says the game. CAUSE THIS ONES HARD
[2:25:45] <Gruhunchously> Why are they exploding after they die?
[2:25:48] <%ooblagis> How much you want to bet Mr. X shows up for like the last 10 kills LUL
[2:25:49] <+Qsmash_> This guy would have to be an S+ Tier Sherrif to pull this off. Hunk levels
[2:25:50] <$DesertPenguin09> destroy all humans!!
[2:25:52] <%MelBrooksKA> Wow, I can see the white flash from the TV on Pat Cam
[2:25:56] <Seedlesslad> I guess they explode so it won't stack and crash the game
[2:25:57] <%speaks2much> lotta JUICE
[2:26:00] <%AlopekisPup> Eliminate the enemy!
[2:26:00] <mak0t0yukii> Raccoon
[2:26:00] <%nictron90> Probably because having 100 corpses stacked up in one area would fuck the framerate
[2:26:01] <%KaironFortressKnight> Well shit If Leon didnt get this guy killed, he would've saved Racoon City.
[2:26:02] <+Bowz1988> No cat ears for pat.
[2:26:03] <sileo_patronus> Fuck this is amazing
[2:26:04] <%aishman> Racooon
[2:26:05] <+8framelag> what the juicy
[2:26:08] <$The_CLaUD> @AngriestPat if you use less than 60 HANDGUN bullets in this mode, you get a hat that gives you infinite ammo in all 4 modes
[2:26:09] <MonstarGrrrl> okay
[2:26:09] <lethallylactic> O K
[2:26:09] <$DesertPenguin09> yea the flash is picking up oon the pat cam
[2:26:09] <CptBritches> Mr. Raccoon hiding
[2:26:10] <+ThatGuyfromMars> @Gruhunchously probably to help reduce lag instead of having piles of bodies
[2:26:10] <%GeneralSCPatton> Pat's true potential is unlocked. He is unfettered from his hoarding and become as a god.
[2:26:11] <mr_mister0> JUICY ZAMBOS
[2:26:12] <%CubicPhantom> defend this gas station with your all
[2:26:13] <MonstarGrrrl> drop you shield
[2:26:13] <%RioGascar> @the_claud I have not for the fuck of me, figured out how you would do that
[2:26:15] <xeros720> kill them all patrick
[2:26:17] <+RC_S3kshun8> Oh it gets harder. >D
[2:26:19] <Shadicara> SPLAT
[2:26:19] <ShadowZiggy> @Gruhunchously I assume it's so the model doesn't stay in the scene for too long. Too many models will slow down the performance
[2:26:19] <%Konquerer> can't have 100 bodies littering the floor
[2:26:20] <madhattergay> Re2make mercenaries?
[2:26:20] <Fluxraw> This Scenario is Pat working in Retail
[2:26:21] <%SmoochSpider> Wave battle
[2:26:23] <KaptainKappathe5th> this is awesome
[2:26:24] <%aishman> Pat the reacooon
[2:26:24] <rufus2k2> there was a shiny!
[2:26:24] <mr_mister0> LUL
[2:26:25] <DirtyPopcornJ> I predict that at 20 this is gonna get fucked
[2:26:26] <Gruhunchously> @ThatGuyfromMars Fair Enough. It's still pretty funny though.
[2:26:27] <TyrantSlime> You ever played Raid Mode in Revelations?
[2:26:27] <LLZeroX> somebody's not dead
[2:26:28] <Seedlesslad> Save your bullets
[2:26:28] <rufus2k2> go check that room
[2:26:29] <forlorncarton> 9 down, 91 to go
[2:26:29] <%AlopekisPup> So this is what would happen if Leon didn't bother him.
[2:26:30] <neooneshin> I would not play this tbh
[2:26:30] <%CerberusDriver> look around
[2:26:30] <Gray_skies1993> I assume this is going to get BIG harder
[2:26:32] <count_bob> Should feel familiar Pat.
[2:26:33] <+RC_S3kshun8> Every new Enemy type ENGAGE
[2:26:33] <reonome> monkaS
[2:26:33] <caol2017> dude i'm a fairy let me in
[2:26:36] <+KillScottKill> is this technically a battle royale?
[2:26:36] <$D4C_Trice> We Cod zombies now
[2:26:38] <saberknight_> at 90/100 they better spawn a mr. x
[2:26:41] <KeystoneA1> @Gray_skies1993 Decidedly so.
[2:26:42] <+8framelag> uh barricade the door?
[2:26:42] <+Bowz1988> @The_CLaUD I think he's past that now lol.
[2:26:43] <$The_CLaUD> @AngriestPat pat pat pat if you use less than 60 HANDGUN bullets in this mode, you get a hat that gives you infinite ammo in all 4 modes

[2:26:57] <$The_CLaUD> @Bowz1988 yeah but he needs to know
[2:27:00] <takokasa> Just think, if Leon hadn't gotten this guy killed he could have solo'd the entire apocalypse on his own
[2:27:01] <+Bowz1988> @The_CLaUD I tried to tell him.
[2:27:04] <+DK_Rance> @AlopekisPup lol no

[2:44:59] <Gray_skies1993> @lewdskeletor13 umm, i know how to use the word? to me it is cringey
[2:44:59] <xeros720> Pat, 2018, "Slam her pregnant until she cries."
[2:44:59] <zwilliams07> Paige is preggiest.
[2:45:01] <+Th3SmartAlec> @Desaura sure is
[2:45:06] <$MajorCrasher> Paige, these are red flags
[2:45:06] <MachigattaLT> this game fucking SLAPS
[2:45:07] <Gruhunchously> Paige has been preggers for a year and a half now.
[2:45:09] <KRSG> @AngriestPat Explain that thought. Where did it come from? How did you formulate that?
[2:45:09] <TyrantSlime> It would be cool to get an RE4 Jacket Leon model
[2:45:12] <The_Sighter> remember kids be gay
[2:45:12] <zwilliams07> That's why she is off cam, to hide the belly.

[2:45:27] <Kaitepaints> not really
[2:45:27] <DrMoose7> its up there

[2:52:48] <$imextremelymanly> the original sound makes the music so much intense though
[2:52:49] <SilentClyde> I hope every gun you pick up with this skin gets polygonal as well and any visible textures get actively worse with time.

[2:53:19] <DrkJP520> What did u just discard?
[2:53:19] <%Prism_Wing> Is the knife infinite, or is the combat infinite?
[2:53:19] <%Laecerelius> hahaha
[2:53:19] <Kingdom_65> @natebud THEN WHY DID YOU ASK
[2:53:19] <FirearmsInstructor> LOL nice try
[2:53:19] <+linSP> BIG infinite
[2:53:20] <+Th3SmartAlec> ANTI CHEAT TECH
[2:53:22] <santystuffs> LUL
[2:53:22] <stabbityrabbit> Huh, polygon flesh must be like a gumball. Crunchy on outside, chewy on the inside.
[2:53:23] <MaxonMashville> WHAT
[2:53:23] <ShichiNoBushi> No sequence break for you.
[2:53:25] <Zulrez> wait, we can play as ps1 leon and claire too?
[2:53:25] <+fizzguy47> FAKE FAN CONFIRMED
[2:53:26] <Bloogoose> Whats the point of playing hardcore if you're just gonna use infinite weapons?
[2:53:26] <%GeneralSCPatton> But no infini-gun?
[2:53:28] <%kasarisenpai> You can still get S+ with the infinite knife.
[2:53:28] <$imextremelymanly> No infinite and only three saves man
[2:53:30] <%Laecerelius> You can infinite knife and get S+
[2:53:30] <%RaikenTB> what? you thought you could sequence break?
[2:53:31] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@sukiyakiwestern) (warning)
[2:53:35] <sileo_patronus> It's not cheating if the game doesn't penalise it
[2:53:35] <+Th3SmartAlec> @Bloogoose Let Pat win
[2:53:37] <+AXL808> this knife diesn't cut tape

[2:53:46] <natebud> @Kingdom_65 Because pat ask a stupid question...
[2:53:47] <+Andrizzleton> you can use infinite knife
[2:53:47] <AzirothTheGreat> Y Are there 4 Samurai edges in that box?
[2:53:49] <%ooblagis> Infinite Knife is fiiiiine
[2:53:50] <KaptainKappathe5th> im fine with him using the infinite knife tbh
[2:53:53] <lloyddboy> LOOK AT HIS ASS
[2:53:54] <FirearmsInstructor> Leon's ass is like a chicken's head... doesn't move with the rest of the body.
[2:53:54] <sdgundum990> That's awesome.
[2:53:55] <antthefool> How do you get the infinite knife?
[2:53:56] <MaxonMashville> knife cuts zombies but not tape
[2:54:00] <SpaceGuntank> speedrun!
[2:54:01] <%Laecerelius> This is Pat's first try at hardcore I think

[2:54:24] <KaptainKappathe5th> 3
[2:54:24] <+Zerodyne90> how many times has pat beaten it before
[2:54:27] <%Typhaeon> Don't worry, it'll lead to more suffering
[2:54:27] <KaptainKappathe5th> USE IT
[2:54:28] <+KillScottKill> 3
[2:54:28] <ShichiNoBushi> This computer's graphics are almost as old as mine.
[2:54:28] <dukenux> Not good
[2:54:28] <+psithen> when is the mod that makes everything poly so you can use the classic ui mod, original soundtrack, and poly models to get a completely retro feel
[2:54:29] <+fizzguy47> don't use the box, Pat
[2:54:29] <myvagabond> Infinite combat knife dosen't count against you
[2:54:29] <Valdorick> 3? 3!
[2:54:29] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @antthefool get all the raccoons and you get the infinite knife
[2:54:30] <$SleepyMaribo> you already took it into your inventory
[2:54:31] <conflict1914> Him dragging the guy is going to look great
[2:54:32] <%mastertwin2> Big gross manimal paws
[2:54:32] <%Jaxnos> you can tell how concerned Leon is by his expression
[2:54:32] <+khalcipher> 3
[2:54:33] <%korth367> 3333
[2:54:34] <godzookylives> NOT GOOD
[2:54:34] <Fujiwara_92> CHEAT PAT, IT'S IN YOUR BLOOD l
[2:54:36] <+Th3SmartAlec> 1 and 3, its fine
[2:54:36] <+chaumiester> The infinite knife is allowed on a S+ run to unlock the infinite Rocket Launcher
[2:54:39] <KaptainKappathe5th> 3
[2:54:39] <aiyobro> leon check the mirror, your face, somethings...
[2:54:40] <%RaikenTB> they don't give the models to ada and sherry though FailFish
[2:54:40] <%AlopekisPup> @Zerodyne90 Like 4 or 5
[2:54:43] <%hawk_rush> YEAH, THOSE PS1 GRAPHICS
[2:54:48] <myvagabond> Infinite combat knife dosen't count against you for s+
[2:54:48] <%TRILLTURBAN> Quick! Use your one big finger to type!
[2:54:50] <arfsm95> what is this
[2:54:52] <%Typhaeon> He's very serious
[2:54:54] <$imextremelymanly> definitely
[2:54:57] <+AXL808> god, i've seen this cutscene so many times from so many streamers and youtubers
[2:54:58] <+GamesWithGreg> Would've been cool if they brought back Paul Haddad to redo the lines for this model
[2:54:58] <Neo_Kaiser> oh boy
[2:54:59] <DeebzNutz100> Stone Faced Leon
[2:55:01] <%Konquerer> elliot could have bodied that zombie easy
[2:55:04] <+Zerodyne90> OK thx
[2:55:05] <natebud> This Leon looks more concerned that the new Leon actually. It's constant concern
[2:55:06] <Fujiwara_92> now?
[2:55:07] <DrkJP520> He's not doing an s+ run now
[2:55:09] <+Qsmash_> no box run ruined FeelsBadMan
[2:55:10] <%Agami23> they dont give claire a second outfit for her low poly model for when she takes the jacket off, do they?
[2:55:11] <%mayorrev> why no classic RE noises
[2:55:12] <%ooblagis> Only nerds don't want you to use the infinite knife, you aren't a NERD are you?
[2:55:12] <+Darastrix> Look at these graphics
[2:55:13] <%AlopekisPup> Pat, just take one out. That way you don't have to go back to the box every time.
[2:55:16] <+Th3SmartAlec> Honestly you get showered in Ink Ribbons
[2:55:19] <Valentinius_Anodyne> :) "Oh no this is super serious"
[2:55:28] <$imextremelymanly> but the infinite weapans though
[2:55:28] <%BakedPretzels> i love it when it hard cuts to leons face
[2:55:28] <%brentoland> Are you playing with the classic SFX?
[2:55:30] <santystuffs> Where is our Elliot Ghost Survivor ;_;
[2:55:34] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Do you have any hardcore S / S+ ranks / runs?
[2:55:35] <sdgundum990> @mayorrev right!!!?
[2:55:36] <Guardiansaiyan> CHEATER
[2:55:37] <Ignitus95> I have a cheat sheet too
[2:55:38] <Quadroxin> Leon, Ada, and Sherry already had retro models in 6.
[2:55:38] <+Th3SmartAlec> ...But you're not going for time
[2:55:39] <%lewdskeletor13> You’re going for S+ Kappa
[2:55:39] <+Freelance7> Of course he does
[2:55:39] <%ThatGuyfromMars> An S rank run is really difficult on hardcore, that 2 hours clear is nuts
[2:55:40] <%AlopekisPup> @Th3SmartAlec Yeah. I think I had like 14 or 15 by the end of the game.
[2:55:40] <Fujiwara_92> CHI CHI?
[2:55:41] <%Prism_Wing> chi chi?
[2:55:46] <LazyLuca> did he already clear all the ghost modes?
[2:55:47] <+psithen> @AngriestPat pat you just take one ink ribbon out so then you don't have to put them back if you reload
[2:55:48] <SilentClyde> OK the stream just glitched out really bad on my end and I could've sworn the game crashed.
[2:55:50] <Valdorick> Cheat... sheet... cheat... CHEAT!? USE THE INFI EVERYTHING
[2:55:51] <Gruhunchously> Leon is really the most terrifying thing in the game at this point.
[2:55:51] <DrMoose7> this is not an open notes test
[2:55:53] <+G_Thunders> You’ve beaten the game 5 times or whatever, S isn’t too bad
[2:56:00] <$imextremelymanly> you aint going for S rank but you cheatin. makes no sense man
[2:56:00] <%ooblagis> @LazyLuca All but the secret 4th one
[2:56:01] <%mayorrev> lego hands
[2:56:01] <%ThatGuyfromMars> yes @LazyLuca just didn't finish the last one
[2:56:04] <%AlopekisPup> @LazyLuca Yes, except the 4th one
[2:56:08] <+nathandiel> Death incoming
[2:56:09] <KeystoneA1> lol that flashlight
[2:56:09] <%Lion_kun> this looks so stupid
[2:56:10] <+Th3SmartAlec> Lighting on the model
[2:56:10] <Plague_bagel> 6 2 11
[2:56:17] <%AlopekisPup> @Lion_kun You look stupid
[2:56:17] <Gruhunchously> Look at his LEGO hands
[2:56:26] <$Tuskor13> so are the zombies also polygons
[2:56:28] <aiyobro> it's a decent character model to be honest, i couldn't do it
[2:56:30] <tungstenviper> @ThatGuyfromMars S rank is 03:30, S+ is 02:30
[2:56:31] <+Th3SmartAlec> RIP Pat on the upcoming hallwat
[2:56:37] <%FrustratedAF> hey chat don't forget to stay hydrated and DRINK WATER SwiftRage
[2:56:42] <dukenux> PS1 butt Kreygasm
[2:56:47] <coltdemont> wait this is the remake?
[2:56:47] <%rumtumtugnutz> I'll show YOU my butt.
[2:56:48] <Thalchampz> drinking my water rn my dude
[2:56:52] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @tungstenviper oooooohhhh
[2:57:01] <VritraReiRei> @AngriestPat im late, will you be going for an S or S+ or any other achievements?
[2:57:02] <dukenux> would be cool if Marvin was polygonal too
[2:57:02] <%AlopekisPup> Some random dude just whispered to me and asked if I play NBA2k
[2:57:03] <%rumtumtugnutz> Not really
[2:57:04] <+G_Thunders> I wish the zombies looked like PS1 too, but they’d have to redo the entire damage modeling
[2:57:05] <Grennold> I hope they have the original bandage over uniform
[2:57:05] <+Th3SmartAlec> OH BOY
[2:57:06] <LuisKingKing> Apparently there was a patch too did they get rid of the stairs glitch?
[2:57:06] <%FrustratedAF> you see elliot? he didn't drink water
[2:57:06] <suikudo> Can we replace Claire with the ghost survivor girl?
[2:57:10] <%mayorrev> turn on the classic sounds
[2:57:13] <$imextremelymanly> the goddamn door needs to be open
[2:57:14] <Seedlesslad> HE GOT NO FINGERS
[2:57:15] <$poisoncubed> cheer100
[2:57:16] <%CerberusDriver> 'hang in there'
[2:57:18] <%Konquerer> they should do all low poly models... and then tank controls... and then fixed camera angles
[2:57:18] <DrkJP520> She's biting it!!
[2:57:19] <AlasterAngelo> water sucks it doesn't even have a flavor
[2:57:19] <%ooblagis> What would be more horrifying, the zombie in front of you, or the polygon monster behind the door?
[2:57:21] <Shadicara> Should of made all human and Mr X models polygon
[2:57:22] <CybertronPrime> Now we need RE4 Leon and Code Veronica Claire.
[2:57:22] <santystuffs> Elliot: "HELP M- WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU"
[2:57:22] <%SirG005E> apatCanada
[2:57:28] <aiyobro> whoops
[2:57:28] <Gruhunchously> The last thing Elliot ever saw...
[2:57:29] <$Tuskor13> What do you think all the people around Leon think of him and his polygon body
[2:57:30] <Kaitepaints> just hold om!
[2:57:30] <%rumtumtugnutz> These costumes make my wiener sad
[2:57:30] <%korth367> HANG IN THERE
[2:57:30] <DrMoose7> mortified
[2:57:31] <+Darastrix> @angriestpat Something kinda cool I noticed was if you turn the lights on in the conference room the light will shine through the bullet holes in the door.
[2:57:32] <gustavozxd> @suikudo with a mod yes, I've seen it.
[2:57:33] <Plague_bagel> this is pretty surreal
[2:57:33] <%AlopekisPup> @suikudo Someone'll probably make a mod if you have it on PC. I'm playing as HUNK with Leon's campaign.
[2:57:34] <Kaitepaints> on!
[2:57:35] <+Th3SmartAlec> Mom's spaghetti
[2:57:36] <3_headed_thing> worst. oral. ever.
[2:57:38] <+AXL808> "See? You're fiiiiiine"
[2:57:40] <Hazard_Kujacker> As Coyote Smith once said... Yu'RE FUKT
[2:57:40] <Valdorick> Better stomp his face now.
[2:57:41] <dukenux> Jesus Christ :|
[2:57:41] <%Remery_> Juicy
[2:57:41] <aiyobro> we're going to get you to a hospital
[2:57:42] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat This is SUPER censored in the Japanese version. He pulls out the guy intact, legs and all. No guts.
[2:57:43] <disister1201> stand behind the desk
[2:57:46] <+Name_Meme> Always icky WutFace
[2:57:46] <%SirG005E> apatCanada "hang in there"
[2:57:47] <$poisoncubed> caress him with your polygons
[2:57:48] <%Gatzarlok> Why does he roll over to get his ding dong eaten off instead of his ass? Seems like the worse way to go.
[2:57:50] <Seedlesslad> Leon actually pulled him so hard his upper half tore
[2:57:52] <+Th3SmartAlec> @disister1201 He knows at least that
[2:57:53] <Kaitepaints> @3_headed_thing I want my money back
[2:57:54] <AFoolishPaper> what does blocky leon look like with 500% facial animation
[2:57:55] <%InsaneJackLondon> If only he could hold on with his polygon hands
[2:57:56] <weontheultralightbeam> the last thing he saw was polygon leon. what a way to go
[2:57:58] <%Remery_> Looks like ground beef :)
[2:58:00] <%michingmallecho> The ol’ claw hands
[2:58:05] <%BakedPretzels> JESUS CHRIST ._.
[2:58:11] <Kaitepaints> haha!
[2:58:13] <+Th3SmartAlec> RIP in 3...2...
[2:58:13] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @firearmsinstructor that's so nuts that the devs had to censor their game for their home country
[2:58:14] <MachigattaLT> immediately doubleteamed
[2:58:15] <+thewaifoo> i didnt know you could do that
[2:58:17] <DrkJP520> That guy got the roughest BJ ever
[2:58:17] <%FrustratedAF> oh god don't forget the boards WutFace
[2:58:18] <Grennold> The situation's gone to hell but there's not a hair out of place on that gorgeous fringe Kreygasm
[2:58:19] <$8BitDsx> If you stand to the right of the door, you can just run passed as he busts in.
[2:58:20] <tungstenviper> @ThatGuyfromMars S in hardcore is super do-able once you know how to save ammo for bosses and avoid normal enemies. S+ on the other hand is a true speedrun, you must do everything perfect since you ahve a 4 saves limit too
[2:58:22] <Lazyallaround> @Seedlesslad That's the power of Low-POLY man
[2:58:25] <DeebzNutz100> I knew him so well... I remember the first words he said to me "Allllaaghaghahgah"
[2:58:25] <%rumtumtugnutz> If the zombos eat his ding dong he doesn't have to pay for the vasectomy
[2:58:26] <aiyobro> oh shit new tech
[2:58:31] <SilentClyde> Oh my god, can you imagine if characters turned into low poly models when they died? That dude would get torn in half and then just melt into legos.
[2:58:34] <%AlopekisPup> I don't know if I'd be more horrified to see a polygonal person running around or a bunch of zombies.
[2:58:35] <Sloavon> PogChamp high level speedrun tech
[2:58:39] <+Th3SmartAlec> Oh shit!
[2:58:42] <%CerberusDriver> theyre a lot faster
[2:58:42] <KaptainKappathe5th> JUKES
[2:58:43] <+dustingunn> those 2 zombies have super low health
[2:58:44] <%Laecerelius> BIG DUMB ZOMBOS!
[2:58:46] <+Th3SmartAlec> NICE
[2:58:49] <%HyperCharge_Sam> Ammo Saving Tech PogChamp
[2:58:51] <%badchoice5> Jebaited
[2:58:52] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @tungstenviper I thought the 4 saves limit was for S runs too, I might have to give it another try without the infinite gun
[2:58:57] <Shadicara> Pat turning his galaxy brain on
[2:58:59] <Gruhunchously> Stupid zombies
[2:59:02] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@Th3SmartAlec) (warning)
[2:59:04] <natebud> Since every zombie takes you down to Danger in one hit now, wouldn't it be less costly to only use single herbs?
[2:59:06] <$imextremelymanly> ya
[2:59:07] <%Laecerelius> YEEEAH!
[2:59:08] <+psithen> you

[2:59:11] <Ion_LaserX> woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE
[2:59:11] <dalishprince> fahzBrain
[2:59:14] <%ooblagis> Did that just give him 23 extra ammo at once?
[2:59:15] <aiyobro> only if they bite you from the back
[2:59:18] <Seedlesslad> How did zombies take over
[2:59:20] <gustavozxd> oh boy
[2:59:22] <%CerberusDriver> eat polygon leg

[2:59:25] <%AlopekisPup> @natebud What do you mean?
[2:59:29] <Gruhunchously> Marvin!

[2:59:51] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 3 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 12oz (360mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[2:59:51] <gustavozxd> would be funny if the faces animated like kingdom hearts 1 and 2 LUL
[2:59:52] <DrMoose7> Polygon Kennedy
[2:59:53] <tungstenviper> @ThatGuyfromMars nah, S run has no save limit, you can even use infintie weapons
[2:59:53] <aimlesshealer> Why doesn't Leon have like mega PTSD after this? IS it his haircut?
[2:59:53] <OwlLightningMage> He looks so fucking stupid LUL
[2:59:57] <%JJCheeker> sad

[3:00:04] <JamJamX3> @AngriestPat What if the weapons and visual effects (fire, electricity, blood, etc.) were all polygonal? LUL
[3:00:04] <RomieDBG> @AngriestPat have u seen the 500% facial animations videos?
[3:00:08] <breakerdsx> Need Marvin and Marvin (Zombie) Polygonal

[3:00:10] <dragoon001914> Thanks hydration bot!
[3:00:11] <+Zerodyne90> I guess there isn't a model that looks like the rendered version
[3:00:12] <%TRILLTURBAN> Good
[3:00:12] <%ooblagis> Yup
[3:00:12] <%mastertwin2> This must be some advanced form of Isekai
[3:00:13] <JamJamX3> @andrewweihl Free DLC
[3:00:14] <%Laecerelius> Sound is good
[3:00:14] <Ion_LaserX> good
[3:00:16] <SilentClyde> is gud
[3:00:16] <arfsm95> i hate this, a lot
[3:00:17] <Thalchampz> still good
[3:00:17] <Fujiwara_92> fine
[3:00:18] <MaxonMashville> it's good
[3:00:18] <+Th3SmartAlec> Dat reload animation
[3:00:19] <The7thCrownLessKing> Is polygon Leon a diversity hire?
[3:00:19] <Gray_skies1993> yep sounds good
[3:00:20] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @tungstenviper you said S rank was 3:30? I got that and only got an A
[3:00:20] <%InsaneJackLondon> still good
[3:00:21] <DeebzNutz100> Leon is such a Square Kappa
[3:00:23] <$spardanwarrior> Sounds great
[3:00:24] <SpookyBeef7> That model is amazing!
[3:00:25] <Guardiansaiyan> @Jacobblast congrats
[3:00:26] <%SirG005E> the sound is great but somethings wrong with leon
[3:00:26] <Shadicara> Leon caught the P virus
[3:00:26] <Emelyns> theyre so good
[3:00:27] <%Laecerelius> 500% Leon is the fucking best
[3:00:28] <%AlopekisPup> Those things are scary
[3:00:29] <SpaceGuntank> you gotta be careful when touching someone made of low-poly, you might cut your hand on the sharp edges
[3:00:31] <aiyobro> he looks like zoolander in those
[3:00:31] <PopulousNix> good!
[3:00:31] <%ThatGuyfromMars> or 2:30
[3:00:31] <aimlesshealer> Most excellent LUL
[3:00:32] <%nademonkey1100> they should have made all of them the pixle versions
[3:00:36] <DrkJP520> I want everything BUT Leon and Claire to be low poly
[3:00:39] <$imextremelymanly> there is a lot of people
[3:00:40] <lloyddboy> POLICE SQUAD CO-OP
[3:00:43] <Lazyallaround> Ada's gonna be so attracted to this Leon
[3:00:47] <+Shastafield> PogChamp
[3:00:47] <%RaikenTB> I doubt that.
[3:00:48] <%ThatGuyfromMars> I just wanna play the game with a Marvin story
[3:00:48] <Kyonclone7> @ThatGuyfromMars just in time then thanks
[3:00:49] <$imextremelymanly> i just want to play as mr. X
[3:00:51] <%Typhaeon> I want Willem Dafoe to have 500% facial animations in real life
[3:00:54] <%mayorrev> BibleThump
[3:00:55] <Grennold> Director's Cut with the new enemies in the main game would be great
[3:00:56] <breakerdsx> Lmao
[3:00:58] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @Kyonclone7 <3
[3:00:58] <tungstenviper> @ThatGuyfromMars A side is 03:30, B side is 03:00
[3:00:58] <+AXL808> more survivors would be great
[3:01:00] <sketchiedetails> what if we get mercs again?
[3:01:00] <CybertronPrime> Isn't a Roguelike mode confirmed?
[3:01:01] <+Th3SmartAlec> @AngriestPat Could you imagine a "canon mode" where you switch off between Leon and CLiare
[3:01:01] <inz0mbiac> Berkin Mode!
[3:01:02] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat WTF did you forget you SIGNED THE NDA!? D:<
[3:01:02] <santystuffs> Yea leaving Marvin out of Ghost Survivors was downright criminal, i bet he getting his own DLC in the future
[3:01:03] <%Konquerer> i want ghost survivor mr x
[3:01:04] <Sloavon> shiny polygons
[3:01:05] <andrewweihl> thanks @JamJamX3
[3:01:06] <PopulousNix> looking so close at his hands is. awful
[3:01:07] <%envy1499> Style meter
[3:01:08] <%JJCheeker> I wish Marvin was a BLUE Will Smith apatSmug
[3:01:09] <gustavozxd> stop.
[3:01:09] <+psithen> LOOK AT THE DETAIL
[3:01:12] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @tungstenviper yeah I still only got an A on it
[3:01:13] <+chronopaladin> dude gave the most powerful weapon in the game
[3:01:13] <NYCrownlessKing> if he takes the knife, does it digitize to 16 hit? @AngriestPat
[3:01:16] <%ThatGuyfromMars> dunno what I did wrong
[3:01:16] <%maskedriderhero> What if they did a super mode where it randomized items and modes while you're playing
[3:01:17] <%RioGascar> @angriestpat do you find it odd they dont have a marvin ghost story? he seems like the most WHAT IF scenario.
[3:01:17] <%SirG005E> im already dying at ada hitting on this leon
[3:01:18] <natebud> @AlopekisPup it seems like you can't get killed unless you're in Danger in this game. So say you eat a first aid spray and take one hit, it's like you wasted that health. But if you just eat a green herb and get hit, you'll go down to Danger just the same and you only lose a single herb
[3:01:20] <VritraReiRei> These cutscenes LUL
[3:01:21] <+Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[3:01:21] <+jt427> polygon Kennedy looks like david bowie a bit
[3:01:26] <+Talbz> They say Ghost Survivors isn't canon, but the Soldier one seems like it would be fine in canon
[3:01:27] <%walternatorz> LUL
[3:01:27] <%InsaneJackLondon> no, he literally cant take it marvin, look at his hands
[3:01:27] <+enickma11> PFFFFFTTT
[3:01:27] <SpookyBeef7> That juxtaposition!
[3:01:29] <santystuffs> i can count the pixels in his eyes
[3:01:29] <studleydoorite> I want to knife to morph into low poly as soon as he hands it to Leon
[3:01:30] <%kewlmyc> BibleThump
[3:01:30] <%Laecerelius> Police station horde mode co-op! Your squad of cops try to stay alive as long as possible and you can like save randomly spawning civvies for extra points or supplies or something.
[3:01:30] <Lazyallaround> LMAO Looking at Marvin being so Serious to this Leon made me burst out laughing
[3:01:31] <breakerdsx> Such expression!
[3:01:33] <Gray_skies1993> @jt427 HE DOES!
[3:01:38] <%Jaxnos> this is the best
[3:01:38] <%BakedPretzels> god marvin is so cool
[3:01:39] <Aydarkzero> this is pretty cool
[3:01:41] <Gruhunchously> This game did Marvin's character so much justice
[3:01:44] <%bread_assassin> Can you sequence break if you had the infinite durability knife?
[3:01:48] <%ThatGuyfromMars> Leon looks too much like Leo Di Caprio I can't do it
[3:01:48] <lloyddboy> no
[3:01:51] <breakerdsx> No
[3:01:51] <aiyobro> make resident evil 3 the dlc lol
[3:01:51] <%Das_Bass> no
[3:01:52] <tungstenviper> @ThatGuyfromMars wait, you mean hardcore? Hardcore is 02:30 and 02:00
[3:01:53] <%Laecerelius> He tried
[3:01:54] <%mayorrev> WE DO IT
[3:01:57] <Plague_bagel> please dont close up on leon anymore, i nearly died of laughter
[3:01:58] <+Th3SmartAlec> "It's my first day!"
[3:02:02] <$imextremelymanly> its like wearing that comic suit in the spiderrman game its so weird
[3:02:15] <%mayorrev> WE DO IT!
[3:02:18] <+PharosOfLight> Man, if you HAD imagined your first day to be zombie apocalypse...
[3:02:19] <Gray_skies1993> ohboyitsmyfirstday

[3:02:40] <$imextremelymanly> the one that you know you will run into again getting key items
[3:02:42] <%Jaxnos> i love seeing the model joints separate from the torso it looks so weird and good
[3:02:43] <+BaronEgo> don't kill any of them its a waste of time
[3:02:43] <%InsaneJackLondon> kill the dead ones
[3:02:44] <$imextremelymanly> you can
[3:02:45] <natebud> You can
[3:02:46] <lloyddboy> you can

[3:02:49] <Gray_skies1993> you can

[3:02:50] <%Tearonex> you can
[3:02:51] <%rdark_ksu> yo thats a cross
[3:02:52] <aiyobro> board em all up dude
[3:02:52] <%AlopekisPup> @natebud Ah. I see what you're saying. There are other things though, like how you move slower on lower health. I might be mistaken too, but I think there are enemies that can do 2 statuses worth of damage.
[3:02:52] <Guardiansaiyan> You can board it up
[3:02:52] <santystuffs> @AngriestPat first one, will make your life MUCH easier when you get the club key
[3:02:55] <sketchiedetails> yeah
[3:02:56] <preplexed> kill all the bad zombies
[3:02:58] <breakerdsx> Lady zombie
[3:02:58] <Guardiansaiyan> @AngriestPat Board it up
[3:02:58] <FirearmsInstructor> Can't get there in time.
[3:02:59] <sketchiedetails> board the 3rd one
[3:02:59] <%ooblagis> If you haul ass
[3:03:00] <+Talbz> Go fast
[3:03:01] <andrewweihl> id run and get that one

[3:03:09] <%Konquerer> not if you don't walk
[3:03:09] <+Th3SmartAlec> NOWWW
[3:03:12] <sketchiedetails> you can make it
[3:03:14] <+Th3SmartAlec> MASH
[3:03:15] <DrkJP520> Board third 1st
[3:03:15] <$imextremelymanly> it will and if you leave it the zombie will be in the next time you come here
[3:03:16] <Fujiwara_92> BE SANIC
[3:03:18] <%Laecerelius> BIG FAST STRONG!
[3:03:18] <+Th3SmartAlec> NAILED IT

[3:03:22] <%HyperCharge_Sam> PogChamp
[3:03:27] <sketchiedetails> you can block off that whole hallway and a few other windows
[3:03:27] <+Th3SmartAlec> This hallway is a fuck
[3:03:28] <Gray_skies1993> @Th3SmartAlec I see what you did there Kappa
[3:03:29] <%Instagig> Y'all see Inside Gaming is revived
[3:03:31] <FirearmsInstructor> Wow I was super wrong. Never did that before.
[3:03:35] <%RioGascar> @angriestpat there is a reason to board the 1st and 2nd. The second you go through the door on the return trip THE WINDOWS ARE ALREADY BROKE and they are CRAWLING IN
[3:03:42] <nepwar> get shit on zombie
[3:03:45] <Gruhunchously> I remember Inside Gaming
[3:03:46] <%FrustratedAF> @Instagig hell yeahh... i mean YYYYYYYYEEESSS
[3:03:47] <+Th3SmartAlec> @Gray_skies1993 ...oh goddammit I didnt even realizr
[3:03:52] <Gruhunchously> God, that was a long time ago.
[3:03:53] <%ThatGuyfromMars> Yes @Instagig RT got most of Machinima's properties
[3:03:55] <Guardiansaiyan> ???

[3:04:03] <faegbeard> ???
[3:04:04] <%Swish19XX> I don't think they spawn until after licker
[3:04:04] <%TheFilth> LUL
[3:04:05] <santystuffs> First one is "mandatory" because once you get the club key it makes it much easier
[3:04:06] <natebud> @AlopekisPup And you actually move faster as Claire on caution, which might be helpful. And here might be an enemy that does two states but it's probably a boss.
[3:04:08] <%mayorrev> SPOOP
[3:04:11] <+Th3SmartAlec> LUL spoopy
[3:04:11] <DrkJP520> I pooped
[3:04:20] <DracaenaLeaf> Silent hill monsters are nearby
[3:04:24] <+philosopher721> Where kitty?
[3:04:29] <sketchiedetails> you can game it by boarding the windows before meeting claire again
[3:04:33] <Shadicara> Leon is the scariest thing in there...
[3:04:36] <%AlopekisPup> @natebud Yeah. Maybe it is just best to save the full heals for bosses now that you mention it. lol
[3:04:37] <+duskerzz> P O L Y G O N S
[3:04:38] <+Th3SmartAlec> amen to that
[3:04:38] <%loveischemicals> Pat, would you say your dick is more like a prickly pear cactus? Or a saguaro?
[3:04:40] <%ThatGuyfromMars> probably screaming at a wall @philosopher721
[3:04:43] <aiyobro> zombie wants chocolate bar
[3:04:46] <Fujiwara_92> yeah that's a good idea
[3:04:49] <%Ahack13> This is one you gotta clear
[3:04:51] <studleydoorite> that hallway takes infinite bullets to clear
[3:04:55] <breakerdsx> Crit plz
[3:04:56] <tungstenviper> @AngriestPat Use the knife!
[3:04:57] <+Th3SmartAlec> KNIVE
[3:05:04] <%Jaxnos> cut that booty

[3:05:05] <+psithen> hes dead
[3:05:07] <%nitsuji94> cut dat ass boi
[3:05:08] <+Th3SmartAlec> He's good!
[3:05:10] <Valdorick> Knife his ass! It is the zombie way!
[3:05:10] <%RioGascar> @sketchiedetails @angriestpat you can totally game it by boarding windows before meeting claire. theres a board over by the armory key you can take AND RUN BACK and board up
[3:05:23] <+Th3SmartAlec> He takes a minute
[3:05:27] <puhff> Srsly, why is he trying to get into the machine? lol
[3:05:28] <JamJamX3> LUL
[3:05:28] <+Th3SmartAlec> COUNTER

[3:05:34] <%nademonkey1100> cut all his limbs off
[3:05:36] <+Th3SmartAlec> SAFE
[3:05:40] <%a_confused_girlscout> Gross
[3:05:46] <+Darastrix> @angriestpat By the way the infinite knife does not affect your final score.
[3:05:48] <%Swish19XX> I wonder how a Dead Rising would be on RE engine
[3:05:50] <andrewweihl> Denied!
[3:05:50] <preplexed> why were you poking him
[3:05:51] <Shadicara> Polygon power
[3:05:53] <JamJamX3> So which window did he board up, chat?
[3:05:55] <troxcree> Boy I sure can't wait for DMC V at 500% animations.
[3:05:59] <+Heywudd> Cut off their faces and wear it over your face as a warning shroud.
[3:06:01] <%ThatGuyfromMars> don't tease me @Swish19XX
[3:06:02] <%AlopekisPup> @puhff He's a vegetarian zombie and doesn't WANT to eat people.

[3:11:32] <KaptainKappathe5th> its basic trial and error logic pat
[3:11:35] <natebud> It's just the Brute Force puzzle you always wanted @AngriestPat
[3:11:36] <Seedlesslad> You should just ask Mr X to open it for you
[3:11:37] <%Kuro_Koshka> speedrunners don't even get that stuff
[3:11:38] <tungstenviper> FUCK OFF
[3:11:38] <gremloid> oh this leon looks better

[3:11:42] <%korth367> they're not that bad you big baby
[3:11:42] <CrimsonFox777> They don't even make sense realistically. Anyone with enough patience can break into them.
[3:11:43] <The_Blumper> Pat hates puzzles?

[3:11:47] <ssks123> DEVIL CRY MAY
[3:11:48] <DSD24> The worst thing in the game is barely any Leon and Claire interactions
[3:11:49] <%GeneralSCPatton> You can get it in 15 moves if you just write that shit down.
[3:11:51] <McAngrimStein> You don't need them for a speedrun
[3:11:52] <%TheYellowcouch> pat they're not random

[3:11:58] <+Th3SmartAlec> No, Birkin 2 is the most infuriating thing in the entire game
[3:12:00] <%Kuro_Koshka> Speedrunners don't get the shotgun or magnum. The shotgun weirdly shows up in NEXT though
[3:12:02] <%TheDullaMAN> Does DCM stand for anything specific?
[3:12:02] <$Tuskor13> Isn't there a puzzle in like RE4 where if you mess it up you have to reload a save

[3:15:46] <LegendaryDorkKnight> well be family once you marry her!
[3:15:47] <Silly_Duckling> Pat's amazing weight-loss program. Lose 5 pounds out of your neck in SECONDS
[3:15:50] <%AlopekisPup> Has anyone ever done an only save run of this game?
[3:15:52] <aiyobro> i would have saved after all the item management
[3:15:55] <%AlopekisPup> Like, no progress, just saving
[3:15:57] <+Th3SmartAlec> there is the 3 save, S+ run
[3:15:58] <%nictron90> He does have to be somewhat conservative with saves, hardcore has limited ones
[3:16:03] <%FrustratedAF> count how many times Crazy Talk exposes pat's balls on stream
[3:16:04] <tungstenviper> Monitors display pre rendered cutscenes

[3:16:42] <%AlopekisPup> @minforter No no. I want ONLY save runs. Just someone repeatedly saving over and over.
[3:16:46] <%JJCheeker> Loen has a polygon pepis
[3:16:50] <%ThatGuyfromMars> just a jumpscare @Valdorick
[3:16:54] <$imextremelymanly> you could preemptively kill that hanging zombie if ya want

I'd blame the white castle, but i eat all kinds of shit. My brothers asked that since they must suffer the waiting time, you all must suffer the details. Unfortunately, my poops have yet to return to their foot+ size.

[3:20:01] <+Th3SmartAlec> @AngriestPat Less Hip piuches on Hardcore
[3:20:03] <sketchiedetails> hardcore mode removes freebie pouches

[3:20:04] <+benswanny> why dos lee on look cuby
[3:20:06] <Fujiwara_92> less hip pouches on hardcore pat
[3:20:07] <Guardiansaiyan> Ass Eater
[3:20:12] <DrkJP520> U get less inventory in HC
[3:20:15] <%mayorrev> ass eater is forever happy
[3:20:15] <forlorncarton> Now all hip pouches require puzzels
[3:20:16] <neooneshin> FEWER
[3:20:16] <+Th3SmartAlec> That's the real difficulty
[3:20:16] <$imextremelymanly> there are like three hip pouch you won't get on this run
[3:20:16] <sketchiedetails> only the ones you can unlock
[3:20:17] <minforter> only 3 hip pouch on hc @AngriestPat
[3:20:17] <%ThatGuyfromMars> it is a skin @benswanny
[3:20:19] <+Freelance7> Welcome to Hardcore
[3:20:20] <%Typhaeon> Shy Nerd Lion Girl
[3:20:24] <natebud> You get half the pouch upgrades you normally do
[3:20:25] <akibablue> Jesus, you're only just now getting to hardcore?
[3:20:26] <%RaikenTB> Then it wouldn't really be hard.
[3:20:26] <%Rshiners> WATER

[3:20:31] <LegendaryDorkKnight> wow a lot of people in this chat never played original re2 huh? Kappa

[3:20:39] <+benswanny> @ThatGuyfromMars lee on has skin
[3:20:40] <+benswanny> ?
[3:20:45] <%AlopekisPup> Yeah. The most annoying thing about it limiting your space is that you can't actually get the achievement for maxing your inventory space on Hardcore.
[3:20:49] <neooneshin> i never played any re, i love pat
[3:20:50] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Hardcore only has 3 hip pouches. 1F Safe, 203 Storage Locker, and Sleep Room in NEST

[3:20:52] <+Th3SmartAlec> LION MEDAL
[3:20:55] <Coystick> lo fi Leon polygons to study/chill to
[3:20:55] <%JJCheeker> I wonder what the developers were thinking when they put those ass eating zombie In the game
[3:20:58] <$imextremelymanly> exactly
[3:20:59] <minforter> lab, store, and one in the safe, only 3 @Th3SmartAlec
[3:21:00] <%AlopekisPup> Yeah
[3:21:01] <lloyddboy> HARDCORE PAT
[3:21:02] <natebud> You get an uneven inventory
[3:21:04] <%nitsuji94> thats wat makes it hardcore
[3:21:05] <$Plutt_bug> its Hardcore
[3:21:05] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @benswanny yeah, leon has a couple of costumes

[3:21:08] <%HyperCharge_Sam> oh wow that sucks
[3:21:09] <McAngrimStein> It's only 3. The one in the safe, the one in the weapon locker room, and the one in the nap room

[3:21:12] <%Keyd00d> Its made specifically to fuck with Pat
[3:21:13] <fabo_joyful> Yup, to piss you off!
[3:21:14] <OwlLightningMage> Just because it's uneven doesn't mean it can't happen LUL
[3:21:18] <+Freelance7> Yeah, the hardest part of Hardcore, for you, will be dealing with an uneven inventory.
[3:21:19] <zeroraider> suck it up pat you only get three
[3:21:22] <TheBlankAce> Yeah its a counter to your ocd
[3:21:27] <%RaikenTB> The game doesn't care about your OCD, Pat.
[3:21:27] <Kaitepaints> Where's the hot girl? did she go to bed?
[3:21:28] <kite1haseo> becky...lemme smash
[3:21:31] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat ocd is already kicking in just thinking about it
[3:21:32] <%ThatGuyfromMars> one day pat is gonna have all this shit memorized
[3:21:34] <$Plutt_bug> I think the puzzle solution are all the same, right?
[3:21:37] <ahbhajit> Yeah Hardcore is a troll mode sometimes
[3:21:37] <%nitsuji94> the uneveness adds to the horror
[3:21:38] <tungstenviper> @AngriestPat EXACTLY your OCD will increase and you will FAIL
[3:21:43] <McAngrimStein> Puzzle solutions are the same, yeah
[3:21:46] <%Konquerer> apatWrong
[3:21:46] <xeros720> pat, your balls are uneven
[3:21:49] <%AlopekisPup> @Plutt_bug Yup. Those only change based on the A or B run.
[3:21:51] <natebud> Watch pat skip the last pouch upgrade, so his inventory can stay even
[3:21:52] <+timtheinchanter> Just don't get the last pouch then
[3:21:55] <Fujiwara_92> nah, buddy your ocd will have to deal with it @angriestpat
[3:21:55] <minforter> i did hardcore with only one hip pouch when speed running, that is no trouble at all tbh @AngriestPat
[3:21:58] <Coystick> All must be Ordered, All must be even, the Body must be a Rock
[3:22:09] <neooneshin> your nipples are uneven
[3:22:13] <roosevelt770> Hes not playing the dlc
[3:22:13] <$imextremelymanly> did you get the ammo here in the lobby?

[3:22:29] <+fizzguy47> i can't believe you're not done yet
[3:22:29] <McAngrimStein> Yeah I went through with 1 as well, the locker room one takes too long and the NEST one is so late it barely matters
[3:22:32] <+Blargimazombie> They did it on purpose to trigger you
[3:22:33] <tungstenviper> 6211
[3:22:36] <%AlopekisPup> Good job

[3:30:42] <FirearmsInstructor> you *cannot* block the first window. The animation always happens.
[3:30:43] <$imextremelymanly> you have to load again
[3:30:43] <DrkJP520> Why you reset, coward?
[3:30:44] <+Th3SmartAlec> You have to load twice
[3:30:44] <tungstenviper> YES
[3:30:46] <breakerdsx> It does if you load while alive
[3:30:48] <%RaikenTB> yeah. it's pretty stupid.
[3:30:48] <%jamiroquais_hat> what the hell was that steak-um that the zombie pulled out of leon there?
[3:30:50] <+Th3SmartAlec> It fucking SUCKS
[3:30:51] <McAngrimStein> Loading after death doesn't reset playtime, however it does lower the adaptive difficulty
[3:30:54] <natebud> That's the penalty for dying now.
[3:30:55] <AlasterAngelo> @gustavozxd hey man it's okay. You'll find someone
[3:30:55] <$imextremelymanly> now it resets

[3:31:17] <gustavozxd> @alasterangelo carciYOWL
[3:31:18] <Taffer85> so that's why my playtimes are so long
[3:31:20] <McAngrimStein> I think it's intentional
[3:31:21] <+tigerfang86> TIME TO LAME IT OUT

[3:32:13] <PSI_Guy95> lmao low poly models
[3:32:16] <%Prism_Wing> @alopekispup gout
[3:32:16] <FirearmsInstructor> Continuing / Loading from the "YOU ARE DEAD" screen keeps the clock going. You need to manually load pre-death, or quit to menu / double load for the timer.
[3:32:20] <McAngrimStein> @ssjklyco If you load from the screen that says "YOU ARE DEAD" it doesn't reset the playtime, any other load does
[3:32:25] <AlasterAngelo> @AlopekisPup Mr. X was telling a lot of bad jokes
[3:32:28] <neverforget2018> Pat, you ignorant slut. I can't believe you forgot that ammo.
[3:32:31] <%AlopekisPup> Makes sense
[3:32:41] <%ssjklyco> @mcangrimstein it did for me.

[3:32:48] <LegendaryDorkKnight> Leon knife Kennedy
[3:32:53] <$DesertPenguin09> Id on't think Pat really cares about run time
[3:32:54] <Taffer85> LuL
[3:32:55] <+Th3SmartAlec> just accurate
[3:32:59] <+Shockrates20XX> You're getting a lot of mileage out of this kinda short game.
[3:33:05] <breakerdsx> Pat just wants to have a chill hardcore playthrough

[3:34:30] <$imextremelymanly> inl ribbon

[3:34:52] <McAngrimStein> The only thing that stops the timer is the Pause menu
[3:34:52] <%Keyd00d> damn
[3:34:54] <$imextremelymanly> a lot of stuff have been replace with ink ribbon like a hip pouch
[3:34:57] <%xemnahort> he'll "save" those for later ha
[3:35:00] <%AlopekisPup> @Keyd00d Yup. Only way to pause the time is to actually pause the game through the menu.
[3:35:00] <McAngrimStein> And cutscenes pause the timer too
[3:35:04] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @Keyd00d pausing stops the timer tho
[3:35:05] <%Big_Dream> there is 1500 ink ribbons on hardcore you can find

[3:37:58] <%ThatGuyfromMars> I am glad
[3:38:04] <Taffer85> is it just leon and claire?
[3:38:06] <%awsomesaucekirby> cheer500 so pat, I've been fighting the ancient leshen in mhw. Haha, fuck that guy. He's the new behemoth! I haven't done any archtempered shit since launch, but some of his moves just 1shot me! I've taken to becoming the "evasion tank" for hunting groups, as well as the wide range heal/buffer. Me and the leshen are both too smart to stay in each other's space for too long, but apparently he's got moves that just disregard the urugaan block bonus. Fuck that!
[3:38:09] <+Th3SmartAlec> oh boy
[3:38:11] <NumberTooBig> does Leon ever get The Coat as a bonus
[3:38:11] <%ThatGuyfromMars> yeah @Taffer85
[3:38:14] <DSD24> Is Ada going to be whack too
[3:38:14] <+x24sonic> LEROY AND CAROL LMAO
[3:38:19] <%AlopekisPup> His blockyness is preventing you from picking up items
[3:38:20] <%Keyd00d> They should've made all the characters blocky
[3:38:24] <$Plutt_bug> This is a weird skin for Claire
[3:38:24] <Kyonclone7> slurp slurp
[3:38:25] <%nademonkey1100> OH BOY

[3:40:10] <lloyddboy> MUGNUM
[3:40:13] <Coystick> Leeroy*
[3:40:13] <KishinGrek> Does anyone know if they patched the stairs glitch?
[3:40:23] <%nictron90> What was the stairs glitch?
[3:40:24] <+x24sonic> elevater
[3:40:25] <Deekman> I can't believe they released a minecraft steve skin for leon that's crazy
[3:40:30] <Fujiwara_92> Leroy*
[3:40:30] <+sham_> doubtful
[3:40:40] <tungstenviper> NO
[3:40:41] <%Ahack13> stairs glith?
[3:40:42] <%Keyd00d> did they patch the stanky leg
[3:40:42] <Deekman> Leroy lol
[3:40:43] <Zeonthescion> They didn't
[3:40:47] <%AlopekisPup> What's that?
[3:40:47] <%awsomesaucekirby> The one from mario?
[3:40:48] <%Graywolf_the_45th> It's not patched. I saw a video of Kendo doing it
[3:40:49] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> That will not be patched
[3:40:52] <+psithen> the what?
[3:40:55] <etoir> it's not a glitch, it's just an animation cancel
[3:40:55] <Metsfan1000> Did you mean to deposit the shotgun shells?
[3:40:58] <Coystick> Leroy mode is now selectable
[3:40:59] <ahbhajit> I don't know if Capcom cares about the stairs glitch
[3:41:01] <$The_CLaUD> @AngriestPat stair glitch still in
[3:41:05] <$Plutt_bug> That is a legit strategy
[3:41:05] <%nitsuji94> That shits hard as fuck to set up

[3:41:16] <+Th3SmartAlec> nailed it
[3:41:18] <+ChiefWilly> well they certainly changed zombie AI, its way smarter than it used to be
[3:41:19] <%AlopekisPup> Why though?
[3:41:22] <GnarlyJarlie> yeah just do a sick BLG past Mr. X
[3:41:23] <Deekman> i almost wish they'd release a low res texture pack for the rest of the game
[3:41:29] <+Th3SmartAlec> COME ON KILL ME
[3:41:29] <Another_Rhombus> Elaborate
[3:41:30] <GnarlyJarlie> *BLJ
[3:41:31] <KishinGrek> It skips the mr X spawn
[3:41:32] <tungstenviper> You can skip half RPD section by performing a glitch on the stairs letting you go out of bounds
[3:41:38] <Fujiwara_92> LUL

[3:41:59] <zeroraider> dam son
[3:41:59] <scrumbotime> If only Umbrella could develop a weapon that could not die to KNIVES
[3:41:59] <PsychedelicSnake> Just got here and was really confused for a minute about whythe Leon model was so boxy
[3:42:00] <natebud> You arent getting a critical for a while cuz of that shit
[3:42:00] <%Laecerelius> lol
[3:42:01] <breakerdsx> Hitstun!
[3:42:04] <%Akanesasusora> what
[3:42:05] <etoir> so that is how you shank a licker
[3:42:05] <blink289> does he have the unlimited knife?
[3:42:06] <+x24sonic> when leon says "you bastard" i just think of that shitty asset flip game art of stealth where the guy says "you motherfucker" in the same tone
[3:42:07] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat you are learning, Daniel San
[3:42:08] <conflict1914> amazing
[3:42:08] <aiyobro> da herb
[3:42:09] <+Jesus_X_Boredom> That's actually kinda baddass when you think about it.
[3:42:10] <disister1201> do you have a high framerates
[3:42:16] <KishinGrek> You can bypass to get the clover key by travelling under the world
[3:42:17] <McAngrimStein> Lickers are pretty weak to the knife
[3:42:20] <%AlopekisPup> He started by knife fighting Lickers
[3:42:23] <%xemnahort> now it all makes sense
[3:42:24] <+MrDeathYtube> fun fact the knife does more damage on pc because the damage is tied to framerates
[3:42:26] <TranquilTurnip> Leon studied the blade
[3:42:28] <Fujiwara_92> KILLING LICKERS WITH A KNIFE? YOU BET LUL l
[3:42:29] <Ion_LaserX> Gotta practice those knife skills somewhere...
[3:42:30] <conflict1914> enough talk, DIE COMRADE
[3:42:30] <kartanonperuna> Holy shit I'm actually watching this live
[3:42:31] <Kyonclone7> "so Licko, how are you going to dodge all these knives?"
[3:42:31] <%Laecerelius> Think of having a high framerate like having a riven on your knife!
[3:42:33] <%notjustagamer> well that's one way to make an enemy completely non-threatening
[3:42:37] <+Th3SmartAlec> Can we get 2 lickers dead by knife?
[3:42:38] <Taarin> It's a knife, it's really powerful, especially against living things
[3:42:48] <TheBigTaco> Hit stun has no weakness
[3:42:49] <zeroraider> so thats why Leon challenged a tyrant with a knife
[3:42:50] <Ion_LaserX> I've got THIS
[3:42:51] <Fujiwara_92> Dead by day knife
[3:42:51] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Run out door them back in
[3:42:52] <grayjammer> licc
[3:42:52] <+Th3SmartAlec> yeahhh
[3:42:54] <%Sephrim> While they were Licking, Leon studied the blade.
[3:42:54] <aiyobro> lol
[3:42:55] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> Block the gap
[3:42:56] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> nice

[3:42:58] <kartanonperuna> Whats the biggest flaw of this remake, Pat?
[3:42:59] <%Blankets_and_Tea> you call that a knife? THIS is a knife
[3:43:01] <LegendaryDorkKnight> Leon Knife Man Kennedy
[3:43:02] <natebud> Even so, Pat just got big lucky just now
[3:43:07] <Fujiwara_92> speedrun strats
[3:43:09] <+Th3SmartAlec> That's so dumb i love it
[3:43:09] <McAngrimStein> You can also just be in the library with the door closed and it'll work
[3:43:10] <Gray_skies1993> that's a great trick
[3:43:19] <+Th3SmartAlec> women shot snake
[3:43:19] <yourliteraldog> Low poly leo
[3:43:26] <+x24sonic> i fucking adore that the bookcase waits until you get out of the way to fall over if you block it
[3:43:29] <+x24sonic> it's so dumb
[3:43:31] <%awsomesaucekirby> Of course lickers are weak to knife. You cut off a tongue and you bleed like asploded pig
[3:43:37] <%AlopekisPup> Lady Arrow Snake.
[3:43:38] <Ryham_Assassin> Lady Arrowsnake is a pretty good name
[3:43:39] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> Wait get the zombie before solving it

[3:47:57] <+Th3SmartAlec> It's a polygon. It's really powerful. Especially against living things.
[3:48:03] <DSD24> @jackpotstampede Official
[3:48:10] <yourliteraldog> INK RIBBON
[3:48:12] <McAngrimStein> There's a mod that turns Claire into Regina from Dino Crisis, looks really good too
[3:48:16] <KishinGrek> This is on par wth the Max payne 1 costume on MP3

[3:48:23] <jackpotstampede> @DSD24 thanks!
[3:48:27] <aiyobro> just keep gunpowder as gunpowder lol or else that adaptive stuff ill kick in
[3:48:31] <natebud> You might as well just use green herbs when exploring the station since every enemy takes you down to danger. No point using full heals
[3:48:31] <DSD24> @jackpotstampede Glad I could help!
[3:48:34] <LegendaryDorkKnight> this is on par with snakes mgs1 costume in mgs4
[3:48:37] <Fujiwara_92> bye S+

[3:48:38] <%rad_rice> oh this character model is so goofy I love it
[3:48:51] <DSD24> Time to fight Frank West Birkin
[3:48:55] <tungstenviper> here’s a lockpick. It might come in handy if you, the master of unlocking, take it with you.
[3:48:58] <yourliteraldog> Low poly textures on everything and turn down the setting all the way
[3:49:00] <aiyobro> they only take you down to red when they bite from behind
[3:49:02] <+fizzguy47> how many saves for s+
[3:49:03] <NukeDaHippies> KH 3 was hilariously bad
[3:49:07] <$nitronLVIII> is it just me or does this look better than mgs1 snake?
[3:49:10] <yourliteraldog> 480P max
[3:49:11] <+Th3SmartAlec> So Splus saves will be normally one per Birkin fight
[3:49:11] <Guardiansaiyan> NOOOO
[3:49:13] <natebud> I originally thought that was Ada LUL
[3:49:14] <McAngrimStein> Biiiiiiiiiiig Bill Birkin crashes in!
[3:49:16] <KishinGrek> Please be polygon berkin
[3:49:17] <McAngrimStein> @fizzguy47 3
[3:49:18] <Fujiwara_92> 3 or less @fizzguy47
[3:49:21] <gustavozxd> seriously that song is too good for kh and I love those games
[3:49:24] <+Th3SmartAlec> yeyeye
[3:49:24] <LegendaryDorkKnight> nothing beats mgs1 snake

[3:49:36] <breakerdsx> Ye ye ye ye yeeeeeahhh
[3:49:36] <Seedlesslad> Is this Jump Force?
[3:49:37] <%awsomesaucekirby> Hot take: You say run is a mediocre track that's only popular because of the moment it goes with, it does not stand on it's own.
[3:49:39] <yourliteraldog> so boxy
[3:49:42] <%rad_rice> leon you don't look very worried about this man
[3:49:43] <aimlesshealer> Zero Punctuation's impression of Kingdom Hearts dialogue is great
[3:49:43] <+lnfinitestar> no not my beautiful blocky face
[3:49:43] <natebud> Leon is filled with determination
[3:49:45] <%notjustagamer> lol leons face looks so dumb
[3:49:46] <%Skrypto> RESPECT THE PIPE
[3:49:46] <madhattergay> Hey birkin
[3:49:55] <%xemnahort> @awsomesaucekirby I agree
[3:49:56] <Kyonclone7> 6/10 Birkin has too many polygons
[3:49:56] <gustavozxd> can you play with mgs1 snake in phantom pain?
[3:49:56] <Coystick> This is the story of innocent mutants being hunted by a horrific polygon Monster
[3:49:58] <Veriior> Leon looks terrified.
[3:49:59] <+Th3SmartAlec> Dammit Paige
[3:50:00] <+fizzguy47> holy shit, I've done 2 in the 1st part of the police station already, that's CUH-RAZY
[3:50:00] <LegendaryDorkKnight> yeah Leon let's try talking to it
[3:50:03] <DSD24> I covered the G Virus y'know?
[3:50:03] <Taffer85> Leon's chest would be crushed if his body was slammed hard enough to bend that steel
[3:50:05] <RomieDBG> 200X Fans: REMAKE RE2 -- 2019 Fans: PUT ALL POLYGON MODELS in RE2 Remake
[3:50:10] <KishinGrek> Cue the farting clowns
[3:50:12] <natebud> has leon tried talking to the zombies like Vice suggested though?
[3:50:15] <NumbusPlays> did words work on any of the previous things you fought, leon
[3:50:17] <+Jesus_X_Boredom> Birkin's Captain America juice did not have the intended side effect.
[3:50:20] <%Konquerer> birkin is just attacking because he's scared of the apatBig polygons
[3:50:24] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Blockman vs Blobman: Round One! FIGHT!!
[3:50:26] <hitorio> @awsomesaucekirby - I can sort of agree with you about the middle part of the song, but I quite adore the beginning of it - all the way up through when it first "drops"

[3:50:36] <Seedlesslad> Does it see through those eyes?
[3:50:37] <%rad_rice> blocky polygons are the true T virus

[3:50:43] <McAngrimStein> P-virus

[3:53:01] <%other_badger> CAMERA
[3:53:02] <limeyprick> this is the BirkEND
[3:53:02] <ahbhajit> all the squishy pixels
[3:53:02] <+Th3SmartAlec> @natebud Used it manually
[3:53:03] <%awsomesaucekirby> Hotter take: FF7 is overrated, and I'd wish for so much horrible mutually assured destruction to stop it from coming out again out of pure SPITE. Behelit included.
[3:53:03] <%rad_rice> he's fiiiine
[3:53:04] <RomieDBG> Press X to E U G H
[3:53:07] <Valdorick> Chunky 64 bit pixels.
[3:53:08] <TranquilTurnip> How many times can Leon EUGH per second
[3:53:09] <%Skrypto> those perlygerns
[3:53:09] <%Big_Dream> time for a costume change
[3:53:11] <%rdark_ksu> ok this death is a tad masturbatory
[3:53:13] <natebud> @Th3SmartAlec ah, missed that
[3:53:17] <BigDaddyofCincinnati> a lot less graphic with that model lol
[3:53:17] <LegendaryDorkKnight> R Kelly playing as I lay that pipe
[3:53:18] <Coystick> Is it ever explained why they grow so many BIG eyes?
[3:53:22] <Gray_skies1993> RIP Pol-leon
[3:53:23] <zeroraider> Guess Pat was small time
[3:53:24] <KaptainKappathe5th> mr.x could probably beat g1
[3:53:25] <%Prism_Wing> Damn, I missed it.
[3:53:26] <+sixcubit> wait, is this hardcore mode?
[3:53:29] <%ThatGuyfromMars> yes
[3:53:31] <Ion_LaserX> @awsomesaucekirby At this rate. Sony will announce the FF7 remake for the PS5
[3:53:31] <RomieDBG> @Coystick to keep an eye on the haters
[3:53:33] <NukeDaHippies> I'm probably wrong, but i thought shooting the eye does the actual damage
[3:53:35] <Kingdom_65> @awsomesaucekirby It is overrated, but the remake might just be what it needs to be considered a great game.
[3:53:35] <Fujiwara_92> Cmon Leroy u can do it
[3:53:40] <aiyobro> they have an deep dream AI mod that renders ff7 ff9 backgrounds in h.d.
[3:53:41] <+Shastafield> does knife strat work on hardcore?
[3:53:43] <%other_badger> @Coystick G-virus was made by innoculating the T-virus into a great old one
[3:53:44] <gustavozxd> people like the thing I don't like DansGame
[3:53:46] <+lnfinitestar> hardcore = bullet sponges
[3:53:55] <Deadxxdead> Would it be insanely easy to only use the infinite ammo gun in a hardcore run any scenario
[3:53:59] <Coystick> eye see
[3:54:00] <McAngrimStein> Knife strat works on Hardcore on 120fps
[3:54:00] <Valdorick> @Coystick Because its the ULTIMATE BOIWEAPON! And what do predators all have? That's right... EYES! So just add more of them, its DNA says!... I'm talk'n out my ass.
[3:54:06] <%InsaneJackLondon> Round 2: Blocks vs Squish
[3:54:11] <ahbhajit> knife strat is mainly a pc thing
[3:54:13] <Yusariz> Knife strat works really well in hardcore, Pat
[3:54:19] <RomieDBG> Guys lets take a shot of alcohol everytime leon EUGHs
[3:54:25] <+Jesus_X_Boredom> G-virus was supposed to be the Captain America serum but Birkin screwed it up.
[3:54:29] <Fujiwara_92> eye understand it now
[3:54:31] <+G_Thunders> Knife strat works on hardcore on PS4, you just need to bring 3 total
[3:54:36] <gustavozxd> use the term "overrated" unironically and your point dies LUL
[3:54:38] <+aspirationdeath> To get my s+ i mostly knifed this guy, then 4 shots to the eye with the shotgun then a grenade did it
[3:54:39] <LegendaryDorkKnight> who needs guns when you have knives
[3:54:41] <Manjove> what is the finish of "I Need ____" i missed it
[3:54:44] <Kingdom_65> Fun fact: Birkin is voiced by the same VA that did Frank West
[3:54:47] <%rad_rice> the term overrated is overrated
[3:54:48] <natebud> So Birkin automatically enters agro mode if you get too far away
[3:54:51] <McAngrimStein> TJ Rotolo
[3:54:51] <+timbob> Dont die and i sub
[3:54:56] <Nesagwa> can we get a version of the MCU where Steve Rogers is just a giant eyeball monster instead? Nothing else would be changed
[3:55:11] <spazzokid919> The character model looks out of place. retro costume?
[3:55:12] <Fujiwara_92> I'd hold those nade for when he grabs
[3:55:12] <yourliteraldog> @RomieDBG we would all die of alcohol poisning
[3:55:13] <%Skrypto> Chungus MAD
[3:55:15] <Brandon__Brando> Thats a cool skin
[3:55:17] <+BorinCorran> @Jesus_X_Boredom Oopsey Doopsey, my Super Soldier Serum gives me multiple easily shootable eyes and a constant craving for incest.
[3:55:17] <Kingdom_65> Pat shoot the fucking eye NotLikeThis
[3:55:21] <RomieDBG> @yourliteraldog LUL NotLikeThis
[3:55:22] <%awsomesaucekirby> @Ion_LaserX @Kingdom_65 I even don't want the switch release. Think I could convince people that nintendo is funding the port rather than a new F-0?
[3:55:27] <%rad_rice> @Nesagwa only if they can hire a real eyeball monster to play him
[3:55:36] <+Jesus_X_Boredom> Shuma-Gorath as the new Captain America. I've heard worse pitches.
[3:55:46] <aiyobro> shoot him in the john loevitz
[3:55:51] <natebud> The eye hitbox is very generous
[3:55:55] <Ion_LaserX> @awsomesaucekirby maybe
[3:55:59] <Pookiedaexzile> Thru the wall off the head
[3:56:01] <%rad_rice> well in fairness that eyeball is quite large
[3:56:07] <Pookiedaexzile> Thru the ceiling
[3:56:08] <%Skrypto> REKT
[3:56:09] <Fujiwara_92> EUGH
[3:56:11] <Pookiedaexzile> hes on fire
[3:56:14] <Valdorick> If orange goop goops out, its hitting the eye, so there's that.
[3:56:16] <LegendaryDorkKnight> that's a big thing you got there
[3:56:21] <RomieDBG> EUGH should be on his tombstone
[3:56:23] <Taarin> Yeah, this would be a pain in the ass with tank controls
[3:56:24] <McAngrimStein> When it's open the eyeball tracks Leon, you can especially see it during knife swipes
[3:56:26] <Kingdom_65> I just want Wind Waker HD on Switch FeelsBadMan
[3:56:30] <%ThePuddingDead> What up Nerds!
[3:56:32] <Taffer85> sneak attack

[3:56:50] <Hazard_Kujacker> shiiiieeeeeet
[3:56:52] <McAngrimStein> lmao
[3:56:52] <+BorinCorran> @Kingdom_65 At this point those HD remasters are the only reason to own a WiiU.
[3:56:53] <%Skrypto> BORKIN
[3:56:54] <Kingdom_65> @ThePuddingDead Yeah it's free DLC
[3:56:58] <Valdorick> Wot!?
[3:56:58] <LegendaryDorkKnight> oh so spooky
[3:57:01] <Ion_LaserX> @ThePuddingDead yep
[3:57:09] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @BorinCorran and wonderful 101
[3:57:14] <Pookiedaexzile> I only wanna Be Wraith....Not that one The real Wraith.....wit the AutoMail and the long hair
[3:57:16] <%ThePuddingDead> Wow, they literally didnt have to do that...like at all
[3:57:21] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @ThePuddingDead glad you could join us
[3:57:24] <%ThePuddingDead> its a nice touch
[3:57:26] <%awsomesaucekirby> The "start conflicts and laugh from the bleachers" bit, not the other stuff
[3:57:32] <Ion_LaserX> @ThePuddingDead and Claire too
[3:57:34] <%Skrypto> apatBig Stupid
[3:57:35] <Taarin> This is probably what happens if you masturbate like 1000 times in a single day.

[3:57:44] <%ThePuddingDead> Yep just got home
[3:57:48] <%Blitz_king01> apatBig Chungus
[3:57:48] <+BorinCorran> @ThatGuyfromMars True, true. But I wouldn't be surprised if it got ported at some point.
[3:57:57] <natebud> Do you think Birkin was always that tall?
[3:58:09] <%Skrypto> Can you imagine not being able to move while shooting in this fight?
[3:58:10] <McAngrimStein> Birkin was a manlet
[3:58:12] <yourliteraldog> Somebody with disposable income commission Shadman to do gender-bent Leon X birkin art now
[3:58:16] <Fujiwara_92> nice
[3:58:19] <RomieDBG> yay
[3:58:19] <+KillScottKill> good jorb
[3:58:20] <+aspirationdeath> I think you can get through 1 and a half knives at 120 fps on this guy before he starts swinging at the start
[3:58:20] <%timbob> gj

[3:58:44] <yourliteraldog> Is sherry low poly?
[3:58:48] <RomieDBG> Resident Evil 2 but every voice line is replaced with EUGH
[3:58:48] <bearwagon> Shooting Leshen with Guns as Geralt is great

[3:58:50] <%Bane_Kaikyo> check for knaifu
[3:58:50] <%Skrypto> AdaBait

[3:59:06] <yourliteraldog> aw
[3:59:08] <McAngrimStein> On Hardcore the adaptive difficulty can only go so low, AFAIK there's only 2 levels of it
[3:59:13] <%ThePuddingDead> so how did the Ghost Survivor thing go?
[3:59:16] <LegendaryDorkKnight> friendship with knife over
[3:59:23] <%Skrypto> Ada PolyWong
[3:59:26] <+BorinCorran> @DracaenaLeaf I can't wait for Ada to start making out with a polygon expressionless face.
[3:59:27] <PSI_Guy95> polygonal titties
[3:59:30] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @ThePuddingDead Pat did pretty well, pretty much beat all of them
[3:59:32] <%Nobrev> probably wont
[3:59:33] <Coystick> Will still get a boner
[3:59:37] <neooneshin> has ada appeared yet
[3:59:40] <Kingdom_65> I hope they release the Witcher crossover on PC soon.
[3:59:42] <%ThatGuyfromMars> not yet
[3:59:45] <Geno4344> would low poly Mr. X be scarier
[3:59:45] <%Keyd00d> DAmn that's short. Well it's free I guess
[3:59:47] <neooneshin> i was distracted by youtube

[3:59:50] <Fujiwara_92> A polygonal boxer,
[3:59:53] <%ThePuddingDead> So who were they? Mayor's Daughter, the fireman and the umbrella guy right?
[3:59:54] <DrkJP520> There's no poly sherry, so probably no Ada
[3:59:56] <tri3dgE027> mmm....the return of the low-poly butzsway
[4:00:00] <%ThePuddingDead> were they just flavor?
[4:00:07] <Fujiwara_92> A polygonal boner, but a boner nonetheless
[4:00:12] <%Skrypto> Tiny Bepis get apatBig BEPIS!
[4:00:14] <%Nobrev> they're short but they're also free and meant to be replayed a bunch
[4:00:17] <Kingdom_65> The only low poly models are Claire and Leon.

[4:00:34] <+giogiothethird> 2 was mayor Daughter
[4:00:35] <Geno4344> were they able to port the low poly models or did they have to remake them from scratch?
[4:00:37] <Quadroxin> If you want retro Ada go play 6.
[4:00:39] <+giogiothethird> 3 is ghost
[4:00:40] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat So how many levels of GoldenEye are you going to play before bed?

[4:10:13] <+ChiefWilly> whens hardcore pat?
[4:10:14] <%xemnahort> @McAngrimStein I'm not arguing about the stock only the three round burst
[4:10:14] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat the guy that dies from X looks like a brazillian actor called fernando caruso
[4:10:15] <Kingdom_65> Nobody tell him. Kappa

[4:10:20] <aiyobro> NOPE
[4:10:20] <KaptainKappathe5th> pat when is hardcore
[4:10:21] <Good_Snacks> LUL

[4:10:22] <%TheGreatBamBe> put him back in
[4:10:22] <+ChiefWilly> shh no
[4:10:23] <%rad_rice> if hardcore is so good where's hardcore 2
[4:10:23] <+x24sonic> pat but when's hardcore though
[4:10:23] <%nictron90> That's a new nope.gif
[4:10:23] <yourliteraldog> when hardcore
[4:10:24] <KishinGrek> Nope
[4:10:24] <lightsinx98> So in canon Leon didnt get hit once right? cause he would be infected if he was attacked and wouldnt make it to re 4 right?
[4:10:24] <%CerberusDriver> has anyone seen Reuben Langdon's commercial reel on Youtube, its amazing
[4:10:25] <Valentinius_Anodyne> An hour ago

[4:10:35] <%iwishthiswasicq> Put it back in! It's not done yet!
[4:10:35] <McAngrimStein> @xemnahort I'm pretty sure the stock is what allows the 3 round burst
[4:10:39] <BallinArbiter> Yeah but when
[4:10:40] <gamezerox> but Pat died and didn't restart, so no haredcore
[4:10:41] <tri3dgE027> I'm confused about the lore of Dr. Li in the Lab. So if the clean-up crew of Hunk assassinated him, how did he become a zambo?
[4:10:44] <majindusto> NOT HARDCORE ENOUGH
[4:10:45] <%cervidaequus> @lightsinx98 canon no protags ever get bit

[4:11:21] <PopulousNix> Love you guys, goodnight!
[4:11:22] <%xemnahort> @McAngrimStein ah I actually thought it was a later upgrade for some reason
[4:11:24] <fragdar> yo.. who da fuck is talking shit about my shit hole of a country?
[4:11:25] <LegendaryDorkKnight> Ari protagonist's are Peak human performance
[4:11:27] <%RioGascar> @angriestpat you can totally either skip that room or NOT FULLY OPEN THE MORGUE SLIDE and GRAB THE KEY through CHEEZ

[4:11:48] <aiyobro> lucky
[4:11:49] <Gruhunchously> Oh lawd
[4:11:51] <Fujiwara_92> CLOSER
[4:11:52] <DrMoose7> not anymore
[4:11:52] <Taarin> EUGH
[4:11:55] <Kyonclone7> 20/10 nice shot
[4:11:55] <Silly_Duckling> twin brother
[4:11:55] <Graxe_> That's why you shoot the legs, Pat. So they can't move through rooms.
[4:11:56] <+MrFlyingMongoose123> groody
[4:11:57] <$Plutt_bug> This is a No Damage run if you are just joining us
[4:11:58] <majindusto> Not Anymore
[4:11:58] <LegendaryDorkKnight> you gross zombie
[4:11:59] <%cervidaequus> eugh
[4:12:00] <Valdorick> Alright guys, we need Chris' worst nightmare, alright, get this - Leon on a couch, and behind him - Ada, Mr X, Ashley, El Salvador, and not Claire.
[4:12:01] <Gruhunchously> Down you go mister
[4:12:02] <%Skrypto> he just wanted to say Goodbye
[4:12:05] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat If you don't kill doggos in cages, you get 1 extra here that comes down the hall, an extra in the kennel, and an extra in the hallway.
[4:12:05] <%rdark_ksu> man thats gotta be gross, like inches away from a blown open zombie head
[4:12:07] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat do you actually use the things you hoard through the game?
[4:12:15] <thehoboacrossts> no damage? wow this is gonna be interesting
[4:12:25] <DrkJP520> How cone that guy has never left the morgue when i played?
[4:12:30] <$The_CLaUD> @AngriestPat you know you can repeat the stairs glitch in the sewers and just walk inside the cable car.
[4:12:35] <natebud> but now you can discard the key at least
[4:12:37] <Valdorick> Is it hoarding if you use them?
[4:12:37] <%MagickBurritoh> Why would he USE items?
[4:12:39] <pive123456> this is actually a new run called the "no skill" run you guys
[4:12:40] <ahbhajit> the hording in survival horror is the best part
[4:12:42] <DrMoose7> he might need them later
[4:12:42] <Kyonclone7> uh oh
[4:12:43] <%ThatGuyfromMars> not yet @natebud
[4:12:45] <LegendaryDorkKnight> who uses resources in a survival horror game?
[4:12:46] <%SuperSonichu> @AngriestPat is there more than 1 Mr. X running around? or is he canonically chasing leon?
[4:12:46] <+TomServal> @valdorick And "That Dog!" just watching in the corner.
[4:12:47] <%Yokuho> Pat, use the boost to push through
[4:12:48] <%nitsuji94> ruh roh
[4:12:56] <%Yokuho> Do a barrel roll
[4:12:57] <Taffer85> theres 6 MR. Xs
[4:12:58] <%RioGascar> @angriestpat if you dont plan on grabbing magnum you can skip morgue.
[4:12:59] <Fujiwara_92> no skill % speedrun
[4:13:00] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat end game with like, 20 mag shots
[4:13:10] <%cervidaequus> Use heals? No....... use bullet? NO! .. infinite knife? yeyeyeyeye
[4:13:11] <%Yokuho> You got an enemy on your tail, use the brakes
[4:13:14] <natebud> @ThatGuyfromMars yeah, but he wouldnt be able to if he missed that door
[4:13:22] <+miguelrod777> Mr.x has a gun in hardcore mode
[4:13:27] <pive123456> @angriestpat Is this one of your new "no skill" runs????
[4:13:29] <%QueequegTheater> DIamond is only good for magnum
[4:13:30] <%ThatGuyfromMars> oooohhh I gotcha @natebud
[4:13:30] <+x24sonic> yeah the diamond key is 100% optional
[4:13:34] <natebud> you also need the other key part from the linen room
[4:13:37] <%QueequegTheater> And mag isn't required for S+
[4:13:38] <KaptainKappathe5th> why would you skip the magnum in a normal playthrough
[4:13:39] <ahbhajit> yup, morgue is only for the diamond key, which is optional
[4:13:39] <sukiyakiwestern> youd miss out on the extra inventory
[4:13:41] <Kyonclone7> why would you skip the magnum tho?
[4:13:44] <TeamAMFer> speedrun dirtbags lol
[4:13:44] <%Blitz_king01> 98 Mr Xs, One Claire and one Leon drop onto a map...
[4:13:46] <Taarin> Why is this police station massive
[4:13:49] <%RioGascar> @angriestpat the morgue key only opens. The basement door and the door for the spare key
[4:13:50] <Huntercd> Is the Mac 11 needed for Claire or can I skip?
[4:13:51] <sketchiedetails> you need to do the morgue
[4:13:52] <FirearmsInstructor> skipping the morgue skips locker 203 / pouch
[4:13:56] <%RioGascar> Who cares about the magnum
[4:13:57] <%nitsuji94> i skipped the magnum on my s+ rank run
[4:13:58] <%RioGascar> it sucks
[4:13:58] <McAngrimStein> I dunno, I skipped the magnum for my S+, and the pouch too
[4:14:03] <+aspirationdeath> You dont need the diamond key for the magnum da fuck?
[4:14:03] <Zeonthescion> Yep you only need the shotgun for Loen and not much else
[4:14:03] <McAngrimStein> It's not a big deal
[4:14:06] <%QueequegTheater> @Blitz_king01 And she gets gbanged by MisterXs while Leon leaves to go find Ada
[4:14:06] <DrkJP520> Isn't club key for magnum?
[4:14:08] <%cervidaequus> @taarin its been converted from a museum
[4:14:17] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat is this your first hardcore playthrough?
[4:14:18] <$The_CLaUD> @AngriestPat did you know if you don't pick up the shotgun or the grenadelauncher, they'll appear in the Lab, so you can just skip them in a speed run
[4:14:21] <TeamAMFer> no magnum is in stars office @DrkJP520
[4:14:22] <+DeeFee> I skipped the magnum when I went for S+, as well as the diamond key
[4:14:24] <sukiyakiwestern> also the stars badge isnt related to the diamond key at all, its the clover key or whatever
[4:14:29] <ahbhajit> you kinda have to skip the pouch on a hardcore, S+ run
[4:14:31] <Taarin> @cervidaequus thanks, that makes more sense in context.
[4:14:33] <%Blitz_king01> I really didn't need that mental image @QueequegTheater
[4:14:37] <LegendaryDorkKnight> puzzle God
[4:14:39] <%nictron90> I still love the KoL tradition of calling people who super optimize for points/time over fun as 'dickstabbers'

[4:16:05] <+Jesus_X_Boredom> When puppers become the snuffers
[4:16:06] <Fujiwara_92> sometimes is okay to heal Pat
[4:16:07] <arfsm95> the blood is also polygonal
[4:16:07] <McAngrimStein> but for real who let the dogs out
[4:16:08] <IgnusSTV> RalpherZ
[4:16:08] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Pat didn't shoot those dogs in the cages....... for shamee
[4:16:09] <$cureneckbeard> That's what you get for killing the doggos
[4:16:14] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Knife works really well against pup jumps once you get the timing. You did it once on the Ghost Survivors.
[4:16:18] <LegendaryDorkKnight> the tables have turned human

[4:16:58] <KaptainKappathe5th> goodnight chat
[4:17:01] <+aspirationdeath> @queequegtheater No it isnt the dongle, its the second key
[4:17:01] <%jamiroquais_hat> was there any reason they didn't bring back crimson heads other than revilement?
[4:17:05] <%FrustratedAF> phillzRIP bye puppers
[4:17:07] <Taarin> But I only have 85 of them
[4:17:09] <+Jesus_X_Boredom> How did the dogs open the doors?
[4:17:10] <%nictron90> Gnight dood
[4:17:16] <aiyobro> crimson heads are only in re1
[4:17:17] <Fujiwara_92> LUL
[4:17:17] <DrkJP520> Bring both elec parts at the same time so you only go through garage once and just run past the doggos
[4:17:21] <captainthunderwolf> HERO, Leon S. Kennedy, SHOOTS THE DOGS while they are in the CAGE and CANNOT ESCAPE HIM.
[4:17:22] <Ion_LaserX> @Jesus_X_Boredom Big Paws
[4:17:22] <+ahegotrigger> like shootin dogs in a cage
[4:17:24] <ahbhajit> Leon is a cat person, it's canon
[4:17:25] <$Plutt_bug> These deaths are legit
[4:17:25] <Valdorick> @Fujiwara_92 But what if there's a boss after the credits? Then I won't have those items.
[4:17:27] <McAngrimStein> Crimson heads are only in REmake, not RE1
[4:17:28] <dragoon001914> Crimson Heads were the specific T-Virus strain at the mansion labs.
[4:17:30] <majindusto> INFINI-DAGGER!
[4:17:30] <$The_CLaUD> @AngriestPat the infinidagger is legit. you can still get S+ with it.\
[4:17:34] <+psithen> if only you had a knife you could have gotten instead of some shotgun shells
[4:17:44] <natebud> leave the red herb in the locker, take the one in the diamond key room
[4:17:47] <StrawberryLion> Something about this looks off. Kappa
[4:17:47] <aiyobro> there is one crimson head in re1
[4:17:49] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Slab 2 5, & 4
[4:17:55] <Pessimystic37> Does he have the infiniknife but hasnt beat the game on hardcore yet? someone looked up the raccoon locations...
[4:17:56] <arfsm95> i saw a guy named bricky play through this game, he used a mag to kill a dog once, i could feel pat physically getting hurt somewhere in the word
[4:17:57] <+BorinCorran> For real though, this game brought out all my worst hoarding tendencies. Because my first playthrough was such a nightmare.
[4:17:58] <Fujiwara_92> @valdorick never use those elixirs, not even on new game plus
[4:18:05] <dukenux> Weren't this kind of puzzle in one Silent Hill
[4:18:05] <%nictron90> I think that crimson heads were caused by a specific strain of the T-virus that was only at the spencer estate so it wouldn't have made sense lore-wise, maybe?
[4:18:08] <dukenux> like, the same kind
[4:18:15] <silverglove2012> I'm here after watching jojo
[4:18:18] <jijipose> Just shoot the dogs before the dogs shoot you
[4:18:31] <Taarin> Using that megaelixir might as well mean you game overed.
[4:18:31] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Flashbang @ 5
[4:18:32] <+JusTTheGuyYouNeed> the dogs despwan after X shows up on the prison
[4:18:34] <natebud> The dogs spawn when you turn on the power though, not when you take the part right?
[4:18:36] <madhattergay> Wait if those dogs are in kennels how and when did they get infected?
[4:18:40] <IminyourBase> when are you doing a no save no item box run?
[4:18:43] <aiyobro> jus run past the dogs and take damage it doesn't matter they only kill you outside of doors
[4:18:46] <ahbhajit> @madhattergay rats
[4:18:46] <captainthunderwolf> Lickers are matured Crimson Heads though, right? I figure the actual lore is, "There are none here, alright? Don't ask."
[4:18:52] <+StromkoPenguin> Plague rats went around and bit everybody apparently
[4:18:57] <Ion_LaserX> @madhattergay rats
[4:19:02] <McAngrimStein> How would you get the other power part without turning on the power? It's in the clock tower
[4:19:02] <$Plutt_bug> 14000 steps
[4:19:05] <+Jesus_X_Boredom> fleas
[4:19:05] <+VoidBastid> answer the question coward
[4:19:07] <majindusto> Man, I wish they added new enemy types/bosses like REmake 1 did
[4:19:07] <Valdorick> @Fujiwara_92 I have a list here of the chests full of Megaelixer, just so I know where it is if I happen to use one of my 99 I have on me, godforbid the day that happen.
[4:19:08] <TranquilTurnip> When are you going to do a no coin run
[4:19:09] <+psithen> pat couldn't handle that
[4:19:10] <badnewsmike> forgot to shoot guy near door this time?
[4:19:15] <natebud> pat forgot to kill the exit zombie
[4:19:16] <Kyonclone7> here we go
[4:19:19] <%cervidaequus> Shhhhhh
[4:19:22] <dukenux> LUL
[4:19:22] <$Plutt_bug> i got 14000 steps on accident
[4:19:23] <Fujiwara_92> this will be fun
[4:19:24] <%jamiroquais_hat> good try
[4:19:25] <%cervidaequus> Shut up everyone
[4:19:27] <natebud> they comin
[4:19:27] <LegendaryDorkKnight> geez Mister zombie calm down
[4:19:32] <%RioGascar> Pat legit doesnt have the mentality to do no item box run
[4:19:33] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat The one that has the key follows between rooms.
[4:19:33] <%RaikenTB> you just bad
[4:19:34] <Fujiwara_92> booooo
[4:19:37] <duppyman2000> 69
[4:19:38] <dankiff> I did no item and frigalist on assisted together in one run
[4:19:43] <%RioGascar> he hordes items and needs to kill everyone
[4:19:46] <madhattergay> U woul think rats would be a going concern
[4:19:47] <Taarin> Leon, fastest thing alive!
[4:19:53] <%RaikenTB> Assisted mode LUL
[4:19:56] <natebud> watch pat run out of this room and get double bit because the dogs show up
[4:19:59] <$Plutt_bug> Pat HAS to pick up every item. Look at his Souls runs.
[4:20:04] <ahbhajit> no item box run is against the spirit of compulsive hoarding that makes survival horror fun
[4:20:08] <+Jesus_X_Boredom> Can mosquitos carry the T-virus. because that's an end of the world scenario right there.
[4:20:19] <FirearmsInstructor> He's 5-srs
[4:20:20] <Valdorick> this bitch is, infact, for real.
[4:20:23] <%nitsuji94> bitch r u forreal
[4:20:25] <TheNewJapanGuy> No item box is fine, just select items for map and collect as need be.
[4:20:26] <%jamiroquais_hat> they probably just turn into bigger bugs
[4:20:30] <Taffer85> inb4 30 handgun ammo wasted
[4:20:32] <Fujiwara_92> Dude wants a piece of that polygon ass
[4:20:32] <DrkJP520> The 3 dogs in the garage disappear when you get the parking key card, so it's better to just run past them the once
[4:20:32] <majindusto> Seriously? No Mutated Rats?
[4:20:33] <$Plutt_bug> Bitch = 4real
[4:20:34] <jijipose> Big HP boy
[4:20:38] <McAngrimStein> Mosquitoes can only carry the M-virus, malaria
[4:20:39] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> my god
[4:20:50] <TranquilTurnip> ez
[4:20:50] <aiyobro> you don't think it be like that but it do
[4:20:52] <+psithen> the burst fire is NOT worth it on hardcore
[4:20:58] <IgnusSTV> Doggo time
[4:21:01] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> Too bad Leon hasn't learned the art of suplexing fools yet
[4:21:04] <dankiff> @raikentb It got the job done fuck it you know why try hard for just two trivial achievements but I got both in one run so why not lol
[4:21:05] <%GeneralSCPatton> cheer500 A no item box run would just kick Pat up to 200 Stress immediately because he has the Compulsive Hoarder trait.
[4:21:05] <$Plutt_bug> 11 pistol rounds or 1 shotty shell?
[4:21:06] <FirearmsInstructor> KILL HERE
[4:21:06] <Graxe_> And that's why I go for the legs.
[4:21:08] <McAngrimStein> Burst fire is easily controllable, as in to not use the burst and fire single shots
[4:21:13] <majindusto> MANY DOGGOS

[4:21:26] <+BorinCorran> @Jesus_X_Boredom tbh, that'd be more interesting than the T-Virus becoming airborne and turning the planet into a desert before they forgot all about it since they didn't want to rip off Mad Max anymore. Paul WS Anderson is a hack.

[4:23:49] <%Trabnaxes> Whoa! I don't even shout that much! (ZombieDogInCage) (Banned)
[4:23:49] <Graxe_> Just break their legs so they can't follow you.
[4:23:50] <FirearmsInstructor> (I think)
[4:23:51] <Fujiwara_92> yeah, i think it's both actually
[4:23:58] <+Elky3> they both follow you @angriestpat
[4:23:58] <natebud> Door guy followed you last time, it doesn't matter, kill them both
[4:24:01] <Graxe_> They both can, yeah.
[4:24:02] <%RioGascar> @angriestpat you can actually 100% not trigger anyone in morgue
[4:24:04] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Push slab BACK IN
[4:24:08] <+psithen> cause moobot says i'm typing too fast @Desaura
[4:24:11] <%RioGascar> NUDE THE KEY GUY OPEN
[4:24:11] <ahbhajit> both can, yeah
[4:24:13] <%RioGascar> slowly
[4:24:17] <%RioGascar> AND GRAB THE KEY
[4:24:17] <RomieDBG> tie door guy's shoelaces together
[4:24:18] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat much easiser to run by
[4:24:23] <natebud> Just shoot their legs out
[4:24:27] <DrkJP520> I've never had either follow me, so if you're fast enough, none?
[4:24:34] <Taarin> Pull down his pants so he's too embarassed to fight you
[4:24:43] <Kyonclone7> try to edge the key? to keep them from activating?
[4:24:48] <+purps26> god that skin is duuuumb looking
[4:25:02] <TeamAMFer> hey this is the defacto original pixel look
[4:25:03] <Graxe_> Crawling zombies are stuck in the room they're in.
[4:25:06] <Polengoldur> @AngriestPat have you ever played Azur Lane?
[4:25:06] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat That doesn't work. I've tried 100 times. he always falls off, nice try :)
[4:25:08] <Ion_LaserX> @purps26 Especially during cutscenes
[4:25:08] <LegendaryDorkKnight> put a shoe on his head
[4:25:11] <%GeneralSCPatton> You can knife the slab guy into just a torso, and he will hilariously flop off when you grab the key.
[4:25:14] <Doomac> shit moon2N
[4:25:14] <$The_CLaUD> @AngriestPat you need to run into the corner to do it
[4:25:14] <madhattergay> Tell him girls are watching
[4:25:17] <dukenux> This is how peak Leon looks like
[4:25:20] <aiyobro> they might forget if you run fast enough
[4:25:21] <%nictron90> You can do it Pat, you beat Chunk's section this should be cake
[4:25:22] <%RioGascar> @angriestpat edge the key. You can actually stop the zombies from activating entirely
[4:25:45] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Leave generator room, HARD left down hall, right @ morgue door, then *BEFORE* kennel, do a 180, and ICE the pupper. He won't nom your ass when you exit the kennel on the other side.
[4:25:48] <Fujiwara_92> You might not like it, but this is what peek Leroy looks like
[4:26:17] <$The_CLaUD> @AngriestPat there's a split second where it lets you grab the key, if you dont pull it out all the way and run at the key
[4:26:24] <RomieDBG> Zombie: Are you the one that keeps EUGH-ing upstairs?
[4:26:27] <Taarin> Stop, don't open that door!
[4:26:33] <DrkJP520> Did the patch that? Never had them follow
[4:26:37] <%RaikenTB> @mostundesired MJ is a cunt in that game.
[4:26:46] <Polengoldur> Spoiler: the dlc retcons it so that Leon gets his iconic jacket from Chris, in exchange for.... well, you know
[4:26:46] <%mostundesired> @RaikenTB We can be friends.
[4:26:49] <majindusto> DONE
[4:26:49] <LegendaryDorkKnight> well howdy Leon
[4:26:52] <Gray_skies1993> man that guy gave no fucks about stopping power at first
[4:26:56] <boatzndhoez> dude leon looks hot
[4:27:01] <%nictron90> Those stealth sections are godawful pace-murderers, as forced stealth sections almost always are
[4:27:06] <%Keyd00d> apatJpeg
[4:27:11] <%Ahack13> @mostundesired Yeah, they just recently started counting your total and consecutive.
[4:27:13] <%nitsuji94> zig zag
[4:27:14] <Zeonthescion> To stun more effectively, shoot the legs Pat
[4:27:20] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat A+ !
[4:27:21] <Kyonclone7> CorgiDerp
[4:27:27] <%mostundesired> I actually like stealth sections, but only when I have my FULL ARSENAL OF ABILITIES.
[4:27:32] <Ion_LaserX> OhMyDog OhMyDog
[4:27:33] <%RaikenTB> @nictron90 I would actually like Sherry's stealth section in this if it had any replay value.
[4:27:33] <Taarin> It's a well known fact dogs can't defeat bullets
[4:27:38] <madhattergay> Poochie
[4:27:45] <+BorinCorran> @nictron90 Can we shame Castlevania Lords of Shadow 2 in particular for terrible forced stealth?
[4:27:48] <majindusto> SHITFUCK
[4:27:51] <$The_CLaUD> @AngriestPat IT DOES
[4:27:53] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@highfivepotater) (warning)
[4:28:01] <$The_CLaUD> @AngriestPat you fucked it up
[4:28:02] <ahbhajit> I have yet to figure out how to cheese the dog AI, they wreck me
[4:28:03] <natebud> It seems like those dogs should be able to use the vents right
[4:28:03] <Polengoldur> @BorinCorran we can shame lords of shadow for a lot more than that
[4:28:05] <Valdorick> Serpentine Harder, fool.
[4:28:09] <+psithen> yes it does you just gotta do it unevenly, don't just do a big Z
[4:28:10] <%nictron90> I hated sherry's bit too, honestly It's genuinely tense and scary, but the gameplay is fucking awful also probably @BorinCorran but I've not actually played that
[4:28:25] <majindusto> ZIG ZAG you FOOL
[4:28:27] <natebud> two middle i think?
[4:28:29] <+RainFerret> middle two
[4:28:29] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat MIDDLE 2
[4:28:30] <Polengoldur> All of them
[4:28:32] <Zeonthescion> None
[4:28:32] <%RaikenTB> far ends
[4:28:33] <$The_CLaUD> themiddle two
[4:28:33] <Emelyns> all
[4:28:34] <%ryome> 2
[4:28:35] <%nitsuji94> the middle one
[4:28:36] <Fujiwara_92> all?
[4:28:39] <studleydoorite> I've seen hippos and elephants serpentine better than that
[4:28:39] <McAngrimStein> Board yourself up
[4:28:39] <ahbhajit> the one the zombie pounds on as you're running by
[4:28:39] <$Wafflum> I never remember this room
[4:28:41] <%RioGascar> None
[4:28:46] <%ssjklyco> middle two
[4:28:47] <Manjove> middle one closest to save
[4:28:47] <%RioGascar> You can easily run by
[4:28:48] <aiyobro> there's never enough lol
[4:28:50] <$The_CLaUD> there's more
[4:28:51] <$imextremelymanly> the third one first and then the second
[4:28:53] <natebud> guess just pick one
[4:28:54] <+Phyronex> r u gay
[4:28:58] <+RainFerret> one will break through now, the other will break through on the way back
[4:29:03] <Graxe_> One will attack a window soon.
[4:29:04] <Kyonclone7> board up Leon so he has box armor
[4:29:08] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat There's one at top of the stairs near the balcony
[4:29:17] <McAngrimStein> Hey look on the bright side, no more dogs
[4:29:18] <%ssjklyco> do the one next to save room first
[4:29:20] <Graxe_> So that one in a bit.
[4:29:22] <%jamiroquais_hat> ,that break room is depressing as shit
[4:29:23] <%RaikenTB> And there goes the save room music FailFish
[4:29:25] <LegendaryDorkKnight> just nail the planks to your neck
[4:29:29] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat you can use on the cop at the bottom near club door, but better to use in this hall
[4:29:32] <TeamAMFer> how many times has he beaten this already chat?
[4:29:32] <%RioGascar> @rainferret No it wont, i havent had a single break during the first run part. Returning after getting the electric parts yes
[4:29:39] <%nictron90> The first time I played t his game I had literally zero bullets for that whole dog segment, so that was fun
[4:29:42] <aiyobro> all that for a crank lol
[4:29:44] <natebud> just stay on caution, you'll go back down to danger in one hit anyway
[4:29:45] <jijipose> Shotgun upgrades are what you want spend you big D hardcore inventory on
[4:29:47] <$imextremelymanly> you know you'll have to deal with those doggo comin back
[4:29:53] <madhattergay> @phyronex Yes im gay grow up
[4:29:55] <silverglove2012> ibl
[4:30:06] <%JJCheeker> Being able to take off weapon parts is really nice
[4:30:06] <$imextremelymanly> so many gunpowder damn
[4:30:07] <FirearmsInstructor> 100%
[4:30:08] <McAngrimStein> btw, Leon's run speed is the same in Fine and Caution, but Claire is actually faster in Caution than Fine
[4:30:09] <$imextremelymanly> yes
[4:30:10] <+BorinCorran> @nictron90 For a game that was marketed as "Hey be badass Scottish Dracula" he sure spent a lot of time as a bundle of rats sneaking past a bunch of Warhammer 40K rejects. It's really bad. Though the game had other problems. I liked the first though.
[4:30:13] <%RaikenTB> nah do the far ends Kappa
[4:30:14] <jijipose> LUL
[4:30:15] <$The_CLaUD> don't bother boarding the window at the bottom of the stairs, you never need to return to the interrogation room
[4:30:15] <ahbhajit> just wait for the zombie to pound it
[4:30:16] <%ssjklyco> yea
[4:30:16] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat board THIRD from steps FIRST
[4:30:18] <majindusto> YE
[4:30:19] <%aishman> The middle two yes
[4:30:19] <laderojomelacojo> yes
[4:30:21] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat ZOMBIE there now
[4:30:23] <$The_CLaUD> yes
[4:30:26] <LeeOhX> first one and the 3rd one
[4:30:29] <Valdorick> That answers it
[4:30:30] <natebud> that narrows it for now
[4:30:30] <LegendaryDorkKnight> yeet
[4:30:31] <%bread_assassin> Is there any difference between the 4 different Samurai Edges?
[4:30:32] <%nictron90> Oof, that sounds like a mess
[4:30:33] <%nitsuji94> there we go
[4:30:35] <laderojomelacojo> the other window is when you return
[4:30:41] <Kyonclone7> Bark!
[4:30:50] <McAngrimStein> @bread_assassin There's some minor stat variations, the descriptions say what they do better
[4:31:06] <$The_CLaUD> there's 4 samurai edges?
[4:31:07] <natebud> You really notice the difference without the stock
[4:31:09] <%nictron90> Does letting your aim thing fully shrink like that up your crit rate, or just improve accuracy?
[4:31:09] <jijipose> Just use a grenade in the hallway Kappa
[4:31:10] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Leave the muncher. He never gets up.
[4:31:17] <McAngrimStein> @The_CLaUD DLC adds 3 samurai edges
[4:31:20] <%RaikenTB> OH NO
[4:31:23] <Valdorick> Aw man, poor what's his name - getting his ass eaten while his body can't eat his own ass...
[4:31:25] <%nitsuji94> OOOHHHHH NOOOO
[4:31:25] <$imextremelymanly> hey pat and chat did you get the gunslinger record for the dlc yet I'm having trouble with it
[4:31:29] <laderojomelacojo> TIL elliot's vest is bullet-proof
[4:31:34] <%ssjklyco> shoot the glat
[4:31:35] <ahbhajit> @nictron90 the bloom affects accuracy and damage
[4:31:37] <natebud> just use a green herb, it's one hit anyway
[4:31:38] <$Plutt_bug> There are 3 different color SE's and 1 infinite ammo SE
[4:31:40] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat you can walk and grab the knife off the wall behind him. Just don't forget about Elliot.
[4:31:43] <%nictron90> Neat, thanks
[4:31:53] <$The_CLaUD> @McAngrimStein I have the dlc, it only added 2... did I fuck up...???
[4:32:02] <Kyonclone7> Boost that wall knife
[4:32:03] <Graxe_> @bread_assassin Original model is infinite, Wesker's does more damage, Jill's has a very short aim time, Chris's I think has either reduced recoil or a smaller base reticle.
[4:32:05] <FunkyRot> baby pat plays baby games for babies
[4:32:06] <McAngrimStein> @The_CLaUD I dunno, they came free with the deluxe edition for me
[4:32:08] <%jamiroquais_hat> does spray effect grade at the end still?
[4:32:17] <%nitsuji94> ?
[4:32:17] <%DedlokPM> no
[4:32:22] <$imextremelymanly> no that was just the original
[4:32:24] <Ion_LaserX> @jamiroquais_hat no
[4:32:25] <McAngrimStein> @Graxe_ I believe Chris's reduces the reticle size faster
[4:32:31] <Valdorick> Aw man, is he about to start eating his own ass.
[4:32:33] <%RaikenTB> LUL
[4:32:33] <Guardiansaiyan> Elliot! LEARN to SHARE
[4:32:37] <Gray_skies1993> he's playing Splatoon with his blood

[4:33:14] <davejackman> Is Mr. X there yet?
[4:33:15] <ahbhajit> this is a shameful fucking performance for these guys
[4:33:18] <+BorinCorran> Has that even happened in a Zombie thing? Where a Bisected guy starts eating his own legs or some such? Because that'd be messed up.
[4:33:21] <$Plutt_bug> Was Elliott eating his own ass?
[4:33:24] <Valdorick> NSEA

[4:42:55] <madhattergay> I love u knfe-CHAN
[4:42:57] <LegendaryDorkKnight> oh come on re6 isn't that bad
[4:42:58] <laderojomelacojo> it's real easy pat
[4:42:58] <aiyobro> i never finished re6 it was too japanese for me
[4:43:04] <ScreamingMeat> Curses, it's only weakness! Wooden doors!
[4:43:05] <jijipose> Just use cheat engine Kappa
[4:43:06] <majindusto> Lickers are NO JOKE
[4:43:17] <Flyrant> is this Hardcore?
[4:43:18] <$Plutt_bug> Use the infinite SMG
[4:43:22] <ahbhajit> RE6 has a lot of good parts, but it's not worth the ton of bad parts
[4:43:33] <aiyobro> too much cheesy crap
[4:43:34] <natebud> Zombies are almost as dangerous as lickers in this mode. They can actually see
[4:43:34] <+polaroidjackson> their pathing sometimes makes it nigh on impossible to stealth them
[4:43:35] <LegendaryDorkKnight> watch the gaming Brit video on re6 and you will understand
[4:43:37] <Kyonclone7> Lickers used to be joke tho
[4:43:38] <redial_nick> feeling fancy enough to trigger double Mr. x tomorrow?
[4:43:40] <majindusto> They will FUCK you UP!
[4:43:44] <%Agami23> just ride a motor cycle into the licker then shoot the motorcycle like in the movie
[4:43:49] <$The_CLaUD> @Plutt_bug ah- aaah--! I see what you did there
[4:43:52] <arkv01> would you fuck the RPD
[4:43:56] <madhattergay> Thats NO GOOD
[4:43:59] <%Tokanova> just dab on the licker apatDab
[4:44:00] <FirearmsInstructor> Not consistently.
[4:44:00] <%Ahack13> Its barely a police station
[4:44:10] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat shoot glass
[4:44:11] <+polaroidjackson> i think claire fares way better against them with the flame GL rounds versus leon's shotgun
[4:44:12] <jijipose> If they do a RE3 remake they should add sliding and scooting around on the ground
[4:44:13] <arkv01> its pretty much a brothel
[4:44:24] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat take care of cop now and grab HGGP(Y) in locker
[4:44:25] <natebud> What happens if the zombies in the press room see you?
[4:44:25] <Flyrant> just knife lickers, it's easy peasy
[4:44:25] <%Tokanova> it's a "former museum"
[4:44:28] <$Plutt_bug> Irons did nothing wrong
[4:44:32] <McAngrimStein> Yeah, Claire handles Lickers a lot easier with the fire GL than Leon's shotgun
[4:44:34] <ahbhajit> flame rounds on the licker are a godsend
[4:44:37] <ScreamingMeat> It's NOT a police station. It's a museum that the cops decided to make a police station
[4:44:46] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat high grade gun powerder (yellow)
[4:44:47] <%nictron90> Was it RE2 (original) that had a mode where it spawned a zombie in a bomb vest, and if you shot him he'd blow up and cost you the game
[4:44:50] <+AAAAAAAQAAAAAAA> yellow gunpowder
[4:44:50] <Flyrant> knives are the best anti licker
[4:44:54] <$Plutt_bug> High Grade Gun Powder (Yellow)
[4:44:54] <+polaroidjackson> i wonder if they're going to fix the framerate fuckery with the knife on PC
[4:44:54] <ahbhajit> the gunpowder yellow
[4:44:55] <%nictron90> or did I hallucinate that
[4:44:56] <Kyonclone7> yellow powder
[4:45:01] <%Tokanova> why the fuck does a museum have to be so labyrinthium and full of puzzles...
[4:45:05] <Xshadowedomegax> How has he not triggered x yet?
[4:45:08] <$The_CLaUD> @AngriestPat High Grade Gun Powder (Yellow)
[4:45:12] <+psithen> High Grade Gun Powder Yellow
[4:45:12] <aiyobro> nah that's kenny in remake definitely
[4:45:13] <Guardiansaiyan> @Tokanova because UMBRELLA
[4:45:15] <CrypticMochi> Because Irons is a dick
[4:45:17] <LegendaryDorkKnight> we want X
[4:45:18] <Pat_Squared> @nictron90 Thats REmake
[4:45:23] <%nictron90> Ah right
[4:45:26] <%nictron90> Thanks :)
[4:45:26] <McAngrimStein> @Xshadowedomegax X triggers from the doused helicopter, you can avoid it for a while
[4:45:27] <Flyrant> lol

[4:58:15] <Ion_LaserX> @TIME_PUNCHER Jesus Christ Maire
[4:58:16] <%deepseal44> @FrostMass22 Before he throws all of his trash on their bodies.
[4:58:23] <%RaikenTB> MJ can jump off a building.
[4:58:27] <Arweynn> Pat, does your love of Rocks make Chris your nemesis?
[4:58:28] <%mitchteck> What about the cubes pat
[4:58:33] <%mostundesired> Gureat jurb
[4:58:37] <Fujiwara_92> shut up, MJ is great in that game
[4:58:43] <%mostundesired> @RaikenTB SHE DID NotATK
[4:58:45] <Valdorick> MJ can die and become a water clone.
[4:58:53] <majindusto> JUMP FORCE is nice for the pre battle interactions...THATS IT
[4:58:53] <%deepseal44> I didn't even know we had a Discord.
[4:58:57] <%deepseal44> Thanks Pat.
[4:58:57] <%TIME_PUNCHER> ??? Profit!
[4:58:58] <%FrostMass22> MJ should be a water clone
[4:59:06] <jarrad101> Dude
[4:59:08] <%Yokuho> @AngriestPat takes about an hour or so to synch up the accounts
[4:59:08] <Fujiwara_92> @valdorick I don't disagree with you, and yet...
[4:59:14] <%Corporate_Redeemer> I'm glad Insomniac realized that nobody liked MJ. If only they realized the same sooner with Speedball
