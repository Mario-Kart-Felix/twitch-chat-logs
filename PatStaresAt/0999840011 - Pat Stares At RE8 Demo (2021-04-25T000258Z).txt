[0:08:05] <%VoidBaronJules> it's crap
[0:08:05] <+Budabist> its dumb as fuck
[0:08:06] <%valriot> Ehhhh, it's fine. I don't even wanna play it cos I wanna go in blind.
[0:08:06] <%twistedj3ster> I MISS DEMO DISCS
[0:08:06] <%fat_burtreynolds> Dang it Bobby, I told you no more Mami Milkers
[0:08:10] <otakon17> it's artificial FOMO
[0:08:11] <Sunstalker> Capcom says dance, monkey, dance LUL
[0:08:12] <mike2hands> i've never seen you this pissed up
[0:08:13] <tuesti> you only have 8 hours to decide to buy it no don't think just buy

[0:08:14] <pikapie> hi pat
[0:08:15] <Goraka91> It's very stupid

[0:08:22] <%za7az> Pat does not want to be streaming right now lol
[0:08:23] <Profmcstevie> And yet here you are
[0:08:23] <+Megamason> huh
[0:08:25] <%linSP> Timed anything is bad
[0:08:26] <%KeiganOfAstora> It's CAPCOM's way of seeing who the real fans are
[0:08:26] <Profmcstevie> so why would they stop
[0:08:29] <%BallerSwagBro9k> INNOVATION PATRICK Kappa Kappa Kappa Kappa Kappa
[0:08:30] <%JoshManVGH> God forbid something to happen to twitch during an 8 hour window.
[0:08:31] <%Konquerer> it's pretty garbage
[0:08:32] <+Megamason> awkward silence
[0:08:33] <%dekkitout> Do you care for it as someone who is pro-skub?
[0:08:33] <%Illithid72> It's a fomo marketing of an already hype game. Just stop.
[0:08:35] <$Zalthia> Its really not good
[0:08:35] <marvel877> Get with the times, Old Man Pat.
[0:08:39] <tuesti> no think, ONLY buy
[0:08:41] <Danger_Beans> Danger_Beans subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 7 months! I usually watch the vods because I can't make the stream!  Big excite!
[0:08:42] <%bread_assassin> Some countries must get really fucked by the 8hr limit.
[0:08:46] <otakon17> and it's only 30 minutes allowed AND online only
[0:08:46] <%solracc25> People have work on weekends too
[0:08:50] <+Budabist> remember how great the re 7 demo was? I dont know what made them do this shit instead
[0:09:00] <$Zalthia> I miss the weird demo shit RE7 had
[0:09:09] <%Illithid72> Fomo marketing.
[0:09:10] <HailSeaser> SUPER Big brain marketing
[0:09:13] <+kewlmyc> You can't preload it?

[0:09:32] <$RealThiele> yea fomo garbage reeks from this move
[0:09:37] <%sniffy77> 2nd and 3rd shift people are kinda screwed
[0:09:38] <Goraka91> @Zalthia Now that was some good shit
[0:09:39] <%valriot> I dunno, Capcom are the only demos that seem to exist now, besides online betas
[0:09:44] <%twistedj3ster> This is straight-up just not gonna be as good a game as 7
[0:09:48] <%saadi90> As a Muslim guy during Ramadan... these demo timing feels pretty similar
[0:10:08] <rufus2k2> just gimme a crumb of vertical slice without the hoops please CAPCOMMMM
[0:10:09] <%JoshManVGH> What benefit is there to this kind of Demo model? IS there a benefit to Capcom even?
[0:10:11] <%sniffy77> thats okay Pat
[0:10:11] <%BestTeaMaker> what's wrong with nier?
[0:10:13] <Profmcstevie> Meanwhile, MH4 and Generations demo on 3DS are unlimited replay 3 monster hunts with online functionality~
[0:10:24] <%za7az> :(
[0:10:28] <%GalacticaPhanto> Just play Gungeon again
[0:10:29] <+kewlmyc> It comes out in like 3 weeks, you could just skip the demo
[0:10:29] <$RealThiele> gungeon if demo fails
[0:10:33] <RevolutionForDogs> Nier is buggy af rn
[0:10:34] <%MrMegaJackpots> what's after the demo?
[0:10:37] <Sunstalker> Never seen your face display as much scorn ever before D:

[0:11:07] <mike2hands> goin to sleep full playthrough
[0:11:09] <%Illithid72> I went to Trader Joes. Besides being neck deep in Grandmas, I got some good stuff so it's been a good Sat for me.
[0:11:10] <%THATGUY_789> its Paturday
[0:11:11] <$sniffy77> It reminds me of whenever I have a appointment I need to go to on a day off. I can't help but keep thinking about the appointment all day and it takes away from the relaxing weekend.
[0:11:19] <%harry_macdougall> skip it man we'll catch you on monday
[0:11:19] <Profmcstevie> Also....just do demo good if your shit keeps leaking

[0:11:32] <$RealThiele> no capcom sucks here too
[0:11:33] <%KeiganOfAstora> is it?
[0:11:41] <Remedy020> maybe they don't want people to find data leaks in the demo? hmm
[0:11:41] <%BallerSwagBro9k> you are big orb baby
[0:11:47] <%miguelrod777> could be both
[0:11:49] <KZXcellent> I came for demo bitching
[0:11:51] <%Illithid72> Nah man. I'm not even going to touch it because of the limited time. I'm in a horror based stream team and we all hate it.
[0:11:53] <$Zalthia> nah its annoying
[0:11:57] <%Danger_Beans> I lost interest in Nier when I learned that it’s not about hot androids.
[0:12:00] <$RealThiele> @BliVru no but someone suggested pat stream kenshi 2 and LUL to that
[0:12:04] <mike2hands> it's super annoying
[0:12:05] <SaphronBlackbourne> Nah, this is really unnecessary, just put out a damn demo normally
[0:12:06] <deviljhojho_> These demos are wack
[0:12:09] <$Damien_Kova> Damien_Kova subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 10 months! 
[0:12:10] <deviljhojho_> i'll still watch tho
[0:12:14] <%EynosStyles> then why bother
[0:12:22] <%Danger_Beans> psaDown psaDown psaDown
[0:12:22] <iosephe> Capcom cares not for the creation of content
[0:12:25] <mike2hands> yeah i was about to say that
[0:12:27] <%MrMegaJackpots> @danger_beans weeeeeell
[0:12:29] <%TheHandsomeKat> TheHandsomeKat subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 34 months, currently on a 34 month streak! Hey Paty McPat Pat. I hardly have time to catch your streams live, but I’m glad to have support you and the mrs’s these few years. May everyone in your household have a good one
[0:12:35] <otakon17> you could cheat in Rise by re-downloading it
[0:12:36] <%fat_burtreynolds> Just show me them Feets Lady D
[0:12:37] <Remedy020> just wait for the main game then LUL
[0:12:38] <%sniffy77> With the 30 minute timer you cant slow down to enjoy the scenery because you dont know how much demo there is left.
[0:12:40] <aiutare47> Has anyone made the "Why cant you be normal" meme about this wack-ass demo format yet
[0:12:40] <%crimsonharvest> Didn't the MH demo let you continue your character too
[0:12:44] <$Zalthia> I really miss the re7 demo. I miss the hyping and the theories and the scavenger hunting.
[0:12:46] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> the most important question is do these demos want you to buy the full game? because that's what demos are supposed to do if the demo is failing and is annoying you you're probably most likely not going to get the game.
[0:12:46] <+Neku054> monster hunter has always had that tho, the 30 tries thing
[0:12:47] <$RealThiele> time to make 5 psn accounts
[0:12:48] <ironhorse92> Exclusive!!!
[0:12:55] <%linSP> Remember the dude that analyzed every aspect of the re2 demo in like a 2 hour video
[0:12:56] <%valriot> I dunno, personally unlike other games, I don't even wanna play these, cos I wanna be surprised. Blind RE is special imo
[0:13:03] <ghoulperson> PatStaresAt more like PatScarestAt
[0:13:03] <cyb3r_demon> epic gamer tiem
[0:13:10] <%Danger_Beans> You could reset it by deleting your save data.
[0:13:12] <ExpressNode> I still haven't touched my demo yet
[0:13:14] <$RealThiele> 80 for full game jesus
[0:13:28] <%radda343> how 'bout them adaptive triggers
[0:13:30] <bakkatohri> @PatStaresAt They released Judgment on Stadia before they released it on Steam.
[0:13:31] <KZXcellent> Canada money ain't real
[0:13:31] <Remedy020> WutFace
[0:13:34] <aiutare47> rip CAD
[0:13:38] <$RealThiele> RIP maple money
[0:13:39] <cyb3r_demon> rip canadian economy
[0:13:43] <Profmcstevie> Moose don't fund themselves
[0:13:45] <Sunstalker> 70€
[0:13:45] <%crimsonharvest> i'd take it, to live in a country where weed comes in the mail
[0:13:46] <%sniffy77> What sucks is the game looks amazing, but why are they giving you these restictions? This is the first gameplay impression you're gonna get. Why hamper it?
[0:13:51] <Remedy020> I'm NA, didn't know the canadian dollar was worse WutFace
[0:13:51] <%dekkitout> I heard that as "Welcome to Canabit"
[0:13:53] <a_mad_dragon_> just pay in bitcoin 4Head
[0:13:54] <feralspidey> I love the great quality of games on screen... and then Fortnite.
[0:13:58] <Goraka91> Should've just made another PT clone like the 7 demo
[0:14:04] <%ClericOfSparda> Hey Pat
[0:14:05] <aiutare47> @sniffy77 Because fuck you
[0:14:18] <$Zalthia> We had excitement with the re7 demo!
[0:14:18] <SaphronBlackbourne> Can this one please have trailer that wasn't already in the showcase unlike the last one
[0:14:18] <%THATGUY_789> I love this despondent  energy that Capcom has manufactured
[0:14:20] <Profmcstevie> Paul marketing is draining hype
[0:14:21] <VidulaSaix> So just dont play it then?
[0:14:22] <illtima> Pat Complains At
[0:14:28] <Profmcstevie> Paul you fucked up, we're letting you go
[0:14:31] <+Jack8274> People only notice the negative stuff usually tho
[0:14:36] <Remedy020> LUL
[0:14:43] <+kewlmyc> But also makes sense
[0:14:48] <$RealThiele> how about dont goto work
[0:14:49] <%twistedj3ster> forget the demos, the game is coming out soon enough
[0:14:51] <%MrMegaJackpots> time to start illegally hauling games across the border
[0:14:56] <%crimsonharvest> Thanks for doing it, no way I'd bust my ass for it myself
[0:14:57] <%ForlornCarton> Yep
[0:14:59] <user_naim> ”BUT THINK ABOUT THE DIVERGING EXPERIENCES Pat!”
[0:15:01] <%sniffy77> Do they want people to talk about the demo all at once?
[0:15:05] <Remedy020> at least it comes out on the 7th so it's close
[0:15:06] <%radda343> I bet this demo is just the maiden areas with a gun
[0:15:08] <bob900000> the castle demo is more gameplay focused
[0:15:09] <%za7az> @illtima Play? Complain? Stare? Who cares! I'm having fun either way :)
[0:15:10] <cnry_m> Y

[0:15:25] <aiutare47> Also has any RE ever done werewolves? I know RE isnt always the most serious but werewolves just seem goofy.
[0:15:25] <Profmcstevie> Soon as those vacs reach full power in THE ORB the video game tunnel begins construction

[0:15:46] <%JoshManVGH> Was there a play limit on Maiden? I remember 60min, but was it ONLY one time?
[0:15:46] <Goraka91> Paul Marketing you did it again
[0:15:49] <$HyperionXV> I'm betting on bug ladies
[0:15:50] <ExpressNode> Do you have to download this or does it update it to the Castle demo?
[0:15:51] <%sniffy77> then the sewer demo
[0:15:52] <deviljhojho_> the villastle demostrationastle
[0:15:54] <%sniffy77> and then the lab demo

[0:24:33] <%psidefx> Some people love giantesses
[0:24:33] <%Raikouija> she's got HUGE Tracks of land
[0:24:33] <%Konquerer> well there you go
[0:24:34] <+LionKagura> GOBLIN
[0:24:34] <%ClericOfSparda> How do you not get it then?
[0:24:35] <smuggleruncle> no shit
[0:24:35] <TheFramedWarlock> Hell yeah
[0:24:35] <%crimsonharvest> Yah so your bias really interferes with your empathy here
[0:24:35] <Laecerelius> Mad because small
[0:24:36] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> no shit
[0:24:36] <%Ranryu692> I'm 6'3 and I don't get it either
[0:24:36] <%blutzwavedave> LUL
[0:24:37] <peachy996> quality joke
[0:24:38] <slix3431> It's about a woman being bigger than you for once
[0:24:38] <%BallerSwagBro9k> we know pat LUL
[0:24:41] <%Agami23> most people are normal height, so its a major difference to them
[0:24:42] <morningmoondude> femdom
[0:24:42] <$realm_forge> I want to see Lady D’s ass descend from the sky like the moon from majora’s mask
[0:24:44] <slix3431> You wouldn't understand
[0:24:44] <+pectusumbra> "I'd really like to see a giant woman" ect ect
[0:24:45] <+tempestzephyr> she big, so you beg
[0:24:46] <+Primarch_Victus94> humongous vampire tiddies
[0:24:46] <teflonbilly777> All these secret unbirthing fans
[0:24:47] <+Damie904> Pat her tits are as big as your head, what do you mean you dont get it?
[0:24:48] <$Zalthia> Its novel to a lot of people
[0:24:49] <%Maids4lyfe> because taller = more mommy energy
[0:24:49] <Cherokia666> That sounds like a Pat Problem
[0:24:49] <bob900000> paige is a giant
[0:24:50] <%Raikouija> she's eat us up
[0:24:50] <%ThirdWelles> It's the change that's fetish-ey
[0:24:53] <SaphronBlackbourne> I'm gay but it seems very obvious to me, dommy, big tittums
[0:24:54] <%dekkitout> Because when I meet someone taller than me- it's a special occasion
[0:24:56] <%psidefx> Pat you being short is WHY you don't see it
[0:24:56] <TheChapyGuy> you just explained it perfectly. It's not special for you
[0:24:56] <crazypsico55> Who was the tallest?
[0:24:58] <+thegreenbenis> It's because it lets us understand how you feel Pat.
[0:24:58] <user_naim> We all want what you have Pat
[0:24:59] <crazypsico55> or how tall
[0:24:59] <%twistedj3ster> I'd hope so Pat, we wouldn't want you dating 3rd graders
[0:24:59] <gitdweezzy> only guy in class to raise hand and admit i would date a taller girl
[0:25:00] <HotMafia81> Has Paige ever stepped on you?
[0:25:02] <Astrophizz> what if she had a smaller hat
[0:25:02] <%blutzwavedave> Paige is Dimitrescu height relative to you
[0:25:03] <+michingmallecho> The sound design creeps me out just walking around
[0:25:05] <MasterTonberry23> big lady is based on a japanese urban legend, the "hachishakusama" (8 foo tall lady)
[0:25:07] <+Euphbugg> LUL
[0:25:07] <+c4llmesnuggles> shed give the bestest of hugs pat
[0:25:08] <%valriot> Pat the truth is we are submissive and kinda sick of submissiveness being seen as weak or gay, cos of toxic masculinity. We want big woman, hold tight, crush head.
[0:25:08] <%BubbaRands> same height in your heels, Pat?
[0:25:08] <%solracc25> Can't never have too much pat

[0:27:23] <%spacerobotunicorn> Lady D back must hurt
[0:27:24] <silveretchedmoon> yeah
[0:27:26] <+michingmallecho> she has to basically bend over to get through the doorways
[0:27:26] <TheFramedWarlock> BIG Lady
[0:27:28] <+CLaY_____________> “Wine”
[0:27:30] <%Jaxnos> yeyeyeye, Lady D doesn't chase you down, she's just going about her errands and swats you if you run into her, i like it
[0:27:31] <thelonechris> That's a huge bitch
[0:27:31] <+purps26> lady d getting her drink on

[0:27:32] <+ryukosbuns> Scott Steiner FAT ASSES
[0:27:32] <+condemned_15> this is all just Bota Box and Paul Masson
[0:27:33] <+talon84> Seems like the opposite problem for pat
[0:27:33] <ToneBacas> maybe she got huge because of the mutation, after this house was built
[0:27:34] <turtlegryphon> She's so dummy big she has to duck down to get wine drunk in the cellar
[0:27:34] <Srthunda> shes a vampire, she will never have back problems tho
[0:27:35] <aiutare47> Yeah why would she get wine, shes a vampire]
[0:27:35] <Goraka91> That poor bioweapons spine
[0:27:36] <%Deft_Thought> Sure but you get to be HUGE
[0:27:38] <%A_Mighty_Walrus> i bet she feels real silly when she forgets the maroon eyeball key
[0:27:39] <%Ynkubus_> It's humbling
[0:27:40] <$RealThiele> waist duck means chest forward. thanks capcom
[0:27:40] <OswaldTheDog> @profmcstevie cause them tall doorframes are expensive af
[0:27:40] <%Raikouija> I can't wait until she turns into a freakizoid monster
[0:27:40] <%ThirdWelles> I imagine her ancestors who built the house weren't expecting a colossus
[0:27:42] <deviljhojho_> must be fucking expensive
[0:27:43] <teflonbilly777> The whole game is actually you rubbing her back
[0:27:43] <%KeiganOfAstora> Meaning she either wasn't always this tall or she moved into someone else's place
[0:27:44] <%VoidBaronJules> her back would ache like hell
[0:27:45] <Profmcstevie> She in a video game, crouch walk is easy and free
[0:27:46] <CappuccinoGuil> is this the pc demo?
[0:27:46] <+michingmallecho> She bends over showing off...dat ass. Capcom knew what why were doing

[0:28:16] <+itsgundamu> ah yes my sex dungeon
[0:28:17] <HotMafia81> Weird choice for bathroom decor, but I've never owned a castle, so what do i know?
[0:28:17] <Laecerelius> The radness is undeniable
[0:28:19] <%Dingus_Tickler> Do you think Shaq has to duck through his doors, too? atpCap
[0:28:20] <Devbob98> They won’t lol
[0:28:22] <%Deft_Thought> Ethan sure does pant a lot
[0:28:23] <%Raikouija> maiden is super dead

[0:28:41] <morningmoondude> Spoopy
[0:28:41] <MasterTonberry23> oh now theyve broken containment
[0:28:43] <%twistedj3ster> every time you say Maiden I think you're talking about the band
[0:28:44] <%IDTheftVictim> IDTheftVictim subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 28 months! Doing good sport keep it up
[0:28:44] <thelonechris> It looks like Pat's streaming room
[0:28:44] <thedrunkenmerchant> And also those panting sounds need to stop, jesus

[0:28:51] <Broken_Sonex> @Deft_Thought He's thinking about that Lady D dump truck
[0:28:51] <%Frost_Quill> Why can't the bioweapon just be cool for once?  It's always blood and death with them, they're one-note.
[0:28:51] <%troxvon_the_lesser> Who ever came up with tall vampire lady as new villain deserves a big raise
[0:28:51] <+condemned_15> Dungeon Custodians don't get paid enough
[0:28:52] <Mr_JustinJones> Ethens scared and horny give him a break
[0:28:59] <morningmoondude> this is so scary if only there was a big, big lady to make us feel better
[0:29:03] <+ryukosbuns> its pats room
[0:29:08] <%KeiganOfAstora> GUN PEOPLE!! What type of pistol is Ethan using?

[0:30:38] <rangriz> gonna die LUL
[0:30:39] <twoto858> You need to block for that
[0:30:39] <thedrunkenmerchant> Hit L1 after blocking

[0:30:39] <+bunchaghosts> medieval shit
[0:30:40] <%twistedj3ster> like a kick or suplex
[0:30:40] <+michingmallecho> like a suplex

[0:30:45] <HotMafia81> So, we all know zombie scary.  But what if sword zombie though?
[0:30:45] <LordOfThePoultry> you do its called shotgun
[0:30:45] <Goraka91> If only you could suplex them
[0:30:46] <%Broand> you fell for the trap
[0:30:48] <BlueBiscuitGT> U need to sword fight the zombies, Zangetsu them maybe
[0:30:50] <%Raikouija> blood on his gun nice touch
[0:30:50] <MasterTonberry23> pat dont get cornered!
[0:30:50] <$lumporr> your melee move is to shoot a gun very close
[0:30:51] <twoto858> Block and then do a counter melee nove
[0:30:53] <deviljhojho_> Ethan you crazy fuck
[0:30:53] <rufus2k2> oh wow blood splatter on the gun
[0:30:53] <Devbob98> Seems fun
[0:30:54] <gunstars20> like a Super kick
[0:30:54] <%IDTheftVictim> Oh there is blood on the gun that is good
[0:30:56] <otakon17> you still have block and the knife
[0:30:57] <cyb3r_demon> maybe you can get sword later in game
[0:30:58] <%Frost_Quill> So Ethan is still moldy right?
[0:30:59] <Shwepie> I like how games have gotten so good looking that breakable objects need to be clearly sign posted.
[0:30:59] <%JoshManVGH> Can you hip fire?

[0:31:08] <mr_saturday93> you can shoot an block at the same time!?
[0:31:09] <$realm_forge> Excellent strategy cornering yourself in a tiny cell
[0:31:12] <%troxvon_the_lesser> Ethan must learn the power of supers
[0:31:13] <%Ranryu692> Shia TheBeef!
[0:31:14] <RuffleDOG> You have a knife
[0:31:14] <Mr_JustinJones> Triple H skull?
[0:31:15] <%Jaxnos> did that vampire zombie just drop an indiana jones reference?
[0:31:15] <%Raikouija> ethan shouldve trained with leon
[0:31:17] <%sniffy77> Indiana jones is that you

[0:31:22] <%IDTheftVictim> Shoot em in the knees and suplex them
[0:31:23] <valriot> Man these are way better than the shitty Molded in RE7
[0:31:24] <causewaybob> Like a German suplex
[0:31:24] <+pectusumbra> they all seem to be blind
[0:31:25] <%crimsonharvest> can you disarm them?
[0:31:25] <%twistedj3ster> pick up that indiana jones movie
[0:31:27] <ThatLJGuy> yeah melee like a knife or something
[0:31:27] <teflonbilly777> SHOT HIM IN THE LEG AND THEN SUPLEX HIM!
[0:31:27] <%A_Mighty_Walrus> he's a bloodborne enemy
[0:31:28] <$apolitenoob> Doesn't Ethan have some kind of guard counter in this one?
[0:31:30] <%KeiganOfAstora> Go for the head
[0:31:33] <Remedy020> thrall maybe
[0:31:34] <%radda343> zompire
[0:31:34] <MasterTonberry23> this reminds me of that one level in house of the dead 2
[0:31:34] <Devbob98> Dead is what he is
[0:31:37] <Goraka91> Morir es vivir
[0:31:38] <$lumporr> AND THE KINGDOM OF?
[0:31:38] <+michingmallecho> Zombie progenitor

[0:31:44] <+vaderxyz1970> I dont like how bullet spongy they feel
[0:31:45] <morningmoondude> swap the knife for the sword
[0:31:45] <%JoshManVGH> That was a terrible movie
[0:31:46] <%KeiganOfAstora> Fuck Indiana Jones wanted that
[0:31:47] <%ThirdWelles> I really love that reload animation
[0:31:48] <$RealThiele> wonder if he heals when he bites you
[0:31:48] <CaptainCliffQuasar> Man hollows are more of a problem without a Zweihander on hand
[0:31:49] <aiutare47> how many shots do those things take to kill?
[0:31:50] <%troxvon_the_lesser> NO That movie is terrible fuck
[0:31:50] <peachy996> It's funny to look at this and spot all the assets that'll be going to the RE4 remake
[0:31:52] <%Jaxnos> HE HAS A SHOTAL
[0:31:52] <cyb3r_demon> shia lebouf lives here
[0:31:53] <BoneofMalkav> Chris Redfield and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
[0:31:58] <dinnydanny777> He looks like the short sword guys in Dark Souls 3
[0:31:59] <user_naim> How’s the gunplay feel Pat?
[0:31:59] <%valriot> YEAH COMBO
[0:32:00] <teflonbilly777> He loves it
[0:32:00] <Portal_Operater> Fuck that movie.
[0:32:01] <%Raikouija> I'll cut your shit!
[0:32:01] <%THATGUY_789> look like ghouls
[0:32:02] <%ThirdWelles> Putting away the spare mag is a nice touch
[0:32:04] <Remedy020> tanky
[0:32:05] <ToneBacas> yeah knife works nice
[0:32:06] <+michingmallecho> damn they take damage
[0:32:07] <+LastnameSilverLastname> LUL
[0:32:08] <rangriz> Knife kinda suck
[0:32:09] <%valriot> KNIFE RUNS CAN EXIST YEAAAA
[0:32:09] <+Mitchellsocks> Chivalry
[0:32:09] <NeonBleu> get Knife'D
[0:32:10] <%solracc25> Indiana Johnes?
[0:32:11] <PinoProxie> we skyrim
[0:32:14] <Idon__> Ethan's arms are the toughest thing in this game
[0:32:16] <bakkatohri> RE7 looked it had better damage models. I'm guessing this game has too many enemy types to do something like that, maybe.
[0:32:17] <cyb3r_demon> finally getting aliens from RE
[0:32:17] <gunstars20> knife BOIS
[0:32:18] <teflonbilly777> Just like back in RE1. KNIFE FIGHTS!
[0:32:18] <Devbob98> Knife kills them quicker
[0:32:18] <tanarath> 'I wish I had a m3lee move' You have knife, pat
[0:32:21] <%crimsonharvest> i hope you get a stake launcher like in Painkiller
[0:32:24] <%JoshManVGH> Seems like it took just as long as shooting it
[0:32:26] <%KeiganOfAstora> These games scare me but I like the concept. I think I'll get this and play on easy
[0:32:28] <$lumporr> i'm glad to see the concept of crystal skulls wasn't ruined by that movie
[0:32:29] <thedrunkenmerchant> Think I might start on Hard mode on release
[0:32:31] <%KeiganOfAstora> Will there be a PS4 version?
[0:32:34] <rufus2k2> viable knife? geddafuggoudaheah
[0:32:35] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> I wish those zombos had the feedback like the ones from remake 2
[0:32:35] <%JoshManVGH> Knife only run!
[0:32:37] <MasterTonberry23> maybe if theres only 1, using melee to save ammo is an option?
[0:32:38] <therealtacopancakes> they look pretty great upclose! And such better design than the dark cum monsters of 7
[0:32:40] <%blutzwavedave> Well I kinda like them more than the Molded so far
[0:32:42] <%Jaxnos> nice
[0:32:45] <%troxvon_the_lesser> Crystal Skull can only be improved via the power of big vampire mom
[0:32:46] <MasterTonberry23> Frag out
[0:32:47] <+katanasquirrel> You'reike 95% through the demo. I finished it in 14 minutes. Felt way more abrupt than the other demo
[0:32:48] <%valriot> Thats big damage
[0:32:48] <+michingmallecho> KomodoHype
[0:32:51] <aiutare47> that was a real wimpy pipe bomb
[0:32:53] <Devbob98> Get wrecked
[0:32:53] <%BestTeaMaker> CAPCOM FIGHTIN' JAM
[0:32:55] <bob900000> the maiden
[0:32:56] <+thegreenbenis> You are like a horrible mutant.
[0:32:56] <+condemned_15> you killed maiden
[0:32:57] <%Jaxnos> oop, you just merked Ingrid
[0:32:57] <%ThirdWelles> And that's a kill. Nice
[0:32:57] <teflonbilly777> The Molded were terrible
[0:32:59] <%Raikouija> Ingrid was maiden right?
[0:33:00] <%valriot> The best Street Fighter character
[0:33:01] <+michingmallecho> nice
[0:33:02] <+thegreenbenis> I mean Ethan is.
[0:33:04] <%KeiganOfAstora> Oh nooo, I work with an Ingrid!!
[0:33:04] <ShaneOcelot> much better than the molded
[0:33:05] <rangriz> @bakkatohri Yeah the gore system in Remake 2 is so good on zombies model
[0:33:06] <%crimsonharvest> so is that ingrid or did it eat ingrid
[0:33:09] <Qsmash_> game is pretty
[0:33:11] <%troxvon_the_lesser> You gotta craft them gun bullets
[0:33:12] <%solracc25> yeah grenades
[0:33:12] <cyb3r_demon> ur gonna make so much at antiques road show
[0:33:18] <scrumbotime> Ohhh, so the ones who don't end up Hot Bug Women end up Basement Ghouls
[0:33:18] <ExpressNode> You can't turn it off?
[0:33:18] <RuffleDOG> Who?
[0:33:21] <Mr_JustinJones> I think the thing that is most impressive about this situation is Ethans doing all this with an massive erection.
[0:33:21] <XeroSigmaPrime> I love the triggers <3
[0:33:23] <MasterTonberry23> wow you have a lot of ammo
[0:33:23] <$RealThiele> samokin in the light
[0:33:25] <%KeiganOfAstora> Dude this is Dark Souls WTF
[0:33:26] <Idon__> Has adaptive trigger actually been good in a game yet?
[0:33:26] <ToneBacas> L1 push away?
[0:33:27] <thedrunkenmerchant> PS4/5 aiming is impossible once you learn mouse/keyboard
[0:33:30] <teflonbilly777> Gunslinger Ethan
[0:33:30] <$lumporr> whats bad abt the triggers?
[0:33:33] <%crimsonharvest> Did you see the prompt for L1 to push
[0:33:33] <ShaneOcelot> wait did that say L1 to push them away?
[0:33:34] <Reanimator83> turn them off. I did
[0:33:36] <+thegreenbenis> How's the trigger feel?
[0:33:38] <rufus2k2> this game needs a dedicated kick button
[0:33:38] <%Broand> L1 is push away?
[0:33:39] <Goraka91> @crimsonharvest Well they all appear to be women so...
[0:33:39] <%ThirdWelles> Really? Do they have a click after some travel?
[0:33:39] <%KeiganOfAstora> DROP YOUR SHIELD
[0:33:40] <ToneBacas> when they're really close maybe?
[0:33:42] <rangriz> After block, press L1 to push
[0:33:43] <%Jaxnos> i assume after a block
[0:33:43] <twoto858> Press the button to block, then again to counter
[0:33:43] <scrumbotime> try aim and l1
[0:33:44] <%Agami23> you can only push away after you block a hit
[0:33:46] <+LionKagura> tthe kick pat
[0:33:48] <mr_saturday93> block and then push away pat....
[0:33:48] <HailSeaser> reload?
[0:33:48] <%Daxalog> Tap?
[0:33:50] <+michingmallecho> Is that parry
[0:33:51] <%IDTheftVictim> Reload
[0:33:51] <$SGrim> @PatStaresAt guarding with an enemy in front of you
[0:33:52] <circular7> goblins
[0:33:52] <+ThomasOfTroy> Oh I like how Ethan's hand is bleeding
[0:33:53] <+rbakervv> after you block you can counter
[0:33:54] <BoneSkore> i love the "oh no" hands
[0:33:55] <%Ranryu692> Pat reload
[0:33:57] <+pectusumbra> I imagine it's context sensitive
[0:33:57] <+LionKagura> reload
[0:33:59] <cyb3r_demon> knife time
[0:33:59] <brainflint> shits locked
[0:34:01] <BoneofMalkav> Reload!
[0:34:03] <%IDTheftVictim> psaGoblin reload
[0:34:03] <Tracazoid> I guess it has a mechanic like Chris in 7's DLC, time it right and you can counter after a block
[0:34:06] <Laecerelius> Only see cool room.  No enter!
[0:34:06] <%spacerobotunicorn> You can turn adaptive triggers off
[0:34:07] <+condemned_15> big sex dungeon energy
[0:34:08] <Profmcstevie> There's increased pressure at the end of the triggers for gun shoot
[0:34:09] <Devbob98> This way more than other demo
[0:34:09] <cyb3r_demon> BEES
[0:34:12] <%Jaxnos> she is bug

[0:34:17] <$realm_forge> The pistol looks like it fires a mild cough at them
[0:34:17] <%KeiganOfAstora> So they wanted the triggers to feel like double action. Not all pistols are double action though
[0:34:18] <%Raikouija> welp

[0:35:14] <yaboi_raidshadowlegends> at least the save room theme is cool
[0:35:16] <devanmuse> Okay, so all the Resident Evil games usually have some "scientific" explanation for all its magic nonsense... how are they possibly going to explain WOMEN TURNING INTO BEES?

[0:35:44] <%Jaxnos> this is the same trailer
[0:35:45] <ToneBacas> @Devbob98 you can intuit that just from two 30 minute demos?

[0:35:55] <teflonbilly777> Who is Rose? Shouldn't he be worried about Mia?
[0:35:56] <TheChapyGuy> the game still looks sick, but these demos suck
[0:35:56] <%ThirdWelles> Alright cool. Are we going to Gungeon or Fortnite, Pat?
[0:35:57] <%Danger_Beans> That’s a disappointment.
[0:35:57] <lemon_lover28> promise 30 minute demo and deliver less

[0:36:37] <mr_saturday93> it was the same length as the other demo the other one felt linger cuz it all had cutscenes
[0:36:38] <+Damie904> Ya doing alright, pat? Hanging in there?

[0:36:46] <+InquisitvePixel> But RE2 Pat!
[0:36:46] <teflonbilly777> @Jaxnos Thanks
[0:36:47] <%twistedj3ster> I want to buy product less now
[0:36:47] <aiutare47> I wonder if its time-gated so you rush, that way when the game comes out for real, you dont feel like youve already done this part. You cant scrape so theres replayablity for the full game. @PatStaresAt
[0:36:49] <%Dingus_Tickler> sbfpSetIn
[0:36:49] <Dunmarkh> resident evil demos are like cbt without the cock and balls

[0:36:53] <%walternatorz> You hit the time limit?
[0:36:55] <Remedy020> Just wait for the 7th Jesus no one is forcing you to play it LUL
[0:36:56] <Cherokia666> i can feel the contempt.  Capcom really making people want to be annoyed at them
[0:36:56] <rangriz> Fuck time limit
[0:36:57] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Just 2 weeks to go its fine
[0:36:57] <bakkatohri> This sucks as much as the fact that you PC guys will never be able to play Judgment on PC now that Google has exclusivity rights over Judgment, the Yakuze spinoff
[0:36:58] <%floniac> re4 has the greatest demo of all time
[0:36:58] <UnK247> there is absolutely no reason these demos exist at all imo
[0:36:58] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> Is that AngriestPat, not PatStaresAt?
[0:36:58] <circular7> make 30 accounts again pat
[0:37:00] <GarbageQueenEllie> Oh wooow that's laaaaame
[0:37:01] <user_naim> So how’s RE8 Pat?
[0:37:02] <+applemon198> you even tried getting back on it to see?
[0:37:04] <redmoon108> NotLikeThis
[0:37:04] <%The_Gaming_Karp> Remember the good old days of PC Gamer demodisks?
[0:37:05] <+ThomasOfTroy> Aren't they all being released together on the 1st?
[0:37:05] <Tracazoid> It's weird because REmake 2's demo had an ending...and a timer. It's so unnecessary
[0:37:06] <+ALazo> there is no "good" reason
[0:37:06] <peachy996> It's to TEASE you. Aren't you more excited to play the full thing
[0:37:07] <DirtyMiser> Are you going to play RE Village on PS5 or on PC?
[0:37:08] <+michingmallecho> it's such blue balls...Capcom knows what they're doing
[0:37:11] <+itspapster> that wasnt the time limit though
[0:37:13] <ToneBacas> it's to create the psychological pressure
[0:37:16] <%Dingus_Tickler> You had 13 minutes leftover atpRtsd
[0:37:18] <scrumbotime> BOOOOY
[0:37:19] <+kewlmyc> Wait it's over already?

[0:37:23] <%ElkRiverDog> !uptime
[0:37:23] <chambatron> I think it was because people would just play over and over RE5 demo on ps3 and they would not but the game
[0:37:23] <@Moobot> @ElkRiverDog I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 37m 42s.

[0:38:09] <aiutare47> Its so you rush through and theres stuff left to replay so you dont slog through an area you already did when the main game comes out I think

[0:39:56] <%MisterTylerrr> I love when Pat speaks frenchy
[0:39:57] <otakon17> but hey the good news is it runs really well on PS4 basic
[0:39:59] <Reanimator83> It feels like you only got him yesterday
[0:40:00] <scrumbotime> residual flavor

[0:40:16] <%dekkitout> Ethan is 1/8th blue cheese
[0:40:17] <bob900000> glad he has more of a personality
[0:40:17] <aiutare47> I wonder if its time-gated so you rush, that way when the game comes out for real, you don't feel like you've already done this part. You cant scrape so there's replayability for the full game.
[0:40:19] <%The_Gaming_Karp> You chill!
[0:40:19] <BlueLunecy> I like the idea of previous game fuckery interfering with current game fuckery
[0:40:22] <fritz_dacat> Gief for prime minister?
[0:40:22] <Aydarkzero> sure
[0:40:22] <GarbageQueenEllie> Nighty Night

[0:40:52] <Shardlab> Forced gaming scarcity!!!
[0:40:52] <$apolitenoob> Does it make you want to play the game any more or less, at least? Or was it too short for you to really care?
[0:40:52] <Chatterbox1991> can we see him on stream?

[0:42:11] <GarbageQueenEllie> when yo lights dont work like they used to befoooooore
[0:42:11] <Devbob98> Well at least that’s an easy fix
[0:42:12] <otakon17> it has a rotation to set intensity and a toggle for on off
[0:42:12] <%KeiganOfAstora> Did you try changing the bulbs?
[0:42:13] <Rotten112> maybe a blown fuse
[0:42:13] <%ThirdWelles> The bulb or the switch popped?
[0:42:14] <+captain_thickthighs> proply just broke the knob
[0:42:14] <$lumporr> sounds like a structural power failure, you're fucked

[0:42:39] <teflonbilly777> Sounds like you broke the plastic in the dimmer
[0:42:40] <otakon17> @rekinom there was barely any game to PRE
[0:42:41] <%KeiganOfAstora> Probably a fuse
[0:42:41] <ohm_wrecker127> @patstaresat As an also electrician I can say it probably broked
[0:42:49] <%THATGUY_789> fuse for sure
[0:42:49] <placeholder03> stream your dad fixing your lights
[0:42:50] <cimturry> I would fucking cry if i had to shit in the dark!
[0:42:51] <XeroSigmaPrime> THAT COULD BE VERY BAD

[0:42:54] <%solracc25> yup fuse
[0:42:54] <%captain_thickthighs> did you check fuses?
[0:42:54] <Valentinius_Anodyne> sounds like a fuse

[0:42:58] <%za7az> @rekinom You missed the whole stream bud LUL
[0:42:59] <peachy996> Free from the sight of God, you pee in the dark
[0:43:03] <%walternatorz> if it's the bathroom, is it possible there's a GFCI that needs to be reset?
[0:43:03] <otakon17> bc that sounds like it really could be the fuse
[0:43:05] <$realm_forge> Pat is your house on fire at this very moment?
[0:43:08] <rekinom> DAMN IT
[0:43:08] <%KeiganOfAstora> At least he knows to do that much. Good job Pat
[0:43:11] <otakon17> @rekinom stupidly short demo time
[0:43:11] <lebendunkel> Hey pat! how are you tonight!
[0:43:17] <%JoshManVGH> Fuse or breaker?
[0:43:18] <Mr_JustinJones> yes
[0:43:19] <%solracc25> the entire room should not have power
[0:43:23] <%KeiganOfAstora> Yea, the one that's not in line with the others is the bad one
[0:43:23] <%JoshManVGH> Breaker
[0:43:24] <MKII> you've solved RE puzzles you can fix a fuse
[0:43:25] <%The_Gaming_Karp> night all
[0:43:27] <%ThirdWelles> That's actually a Breaker, but yeah
[0:43:29] <MacMog> if you can turn them on and off, they’re circuit breakers, not fuses
[0:43:30] <wolfen091> red means tripped breaker, reset it
[0:43:32] <%ThirdWelles> Fuses are disposable
[0:43:35] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt it's a breaker not a fuse
[0:43:36] <Rotten112> red is for emergency shut off in case of blown fuse pre sure
[0:43:39] <%THATGUY_789> ahits buggered
[0:43:40] <%KeiganOfAstora> wolfen is right
[0:43:41] <ohm_wrecker127> @patstaresat its an arc fault trip. you have to completely reset the breaker
[0:43:42] <%KeiganOfAstora> Reset the breaker
[0:43:43] <%blutzwavedave> There should be some more at the police station
[0:43:47] <Devbob98> Can’t you just reset it?
[0:43:52] <%twistedj3ster> SHORT TO GROUND
[0:43:52] <%linSP> uh oh somethings borked
[0:43:53] <wolfen091> okay then you have a short
[0:43:54] <%ElkRiverDog> Chat trying to put Pat’s dad out of work coxBaeloy
[0:43:54] <%Dingus_Tickler> Red means its off
[0:43:55] <%solracc25> breaker reset
[0:43:55] <otakon17> red just means you need to reset it
[0:43:57] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Grounding issue maybe?
[0:43:59] <%JoshManVGH> Ooh ok so somethings zapped
[0:44:00] <%twistedj3ster> just like you Pat
[0:44:02] <%KeiganOfAstora> Chat will help you fix it right now
[0:44:04] <%Dingus_Tickler> Yeah
[0:44:04] <ohm_wrecker127> oh so then the switch is faulted
[0:44:05] <%dekkitout> So what you sayin is that switches be trippin?
[0:44:07] <%KeiganOfAstora> Call dad, tell him to stay home
[0:44:07] <%blutzwavedave> Swap it out with a rectangle dimmer, those are cooler
[0:44:10] <placeholder03> just move to a different house
[0:44:10] <aiutare47> If it an old-timey potentiameter it could be the mechanism inside broke and it doesn't complete a circuit anymore or maybe even shorted
[0:44:16] <otakon17> switch needs replacing
[0:44:17] <%solracc25> Then the breaker is working good
[0:44:18] <$SGrim> @PatStaresAt do you feel any heat from the switch itself?
[0:44:22] <%MrP33Ps> MrP33Ps subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 15 months! hey man you're pretty cool. thank you for being cool
[0:44:24] <$lumporr> is the stream still going
[0:44:24] <FourthQueen> Is that the fucking dog snoring in the background
[0:44:29] <Aydarkzero> sounds like it
[0:44:30] <Devbob98> Just show chat the switch
[0:44:32] <%Maids4lyfe> the switch exploded too then
[0:44:33] <%linSP> the switch is probably shorting
[0:44:34] <%THATGUY_789> switch is shorted
[0:44:36] <bob900000> love
[0:44:37] <otakon17> replace the dimmer switch and reset the fuse
[0:44:38] <%ThirdWelles> Most likely, yeah
[0:44:38] <Madovir> you're going to need to swap out the whole switch but that's like a 10 minute job
[0:44:38] <FourthQueen> he's SO LOUD
[0:44:39] <Mr_JustinJones> Perhaps the house is haunted
[0:44:44] <%Pookiedaexzile> He Vaccum
[0:44:47] <%KeiganOfAstora> So do that now. Chat helped lol
[0:44:47] <$BlackMage66652> Pat's audience has far more electricians in it that I expected. What the fuck

[0:44:57] <UnK247> YES
[0:44:58] <%JoshManVGH> No
[0:44:59] <otakon17> go buy yourself a new dimmer AND MAKE SURE YOU TURN OFF THE BREAKER BEFORE REPLACING IT
[0:44:59] <s1rcuit> means the current is going where it shouldn't
[0:45:00] <Aydarkzero> the wiring sucks
[0:45:02] <%ThirdWelles> A short is an electrical connection that isn't supposed to exist
[0:45:02] <%JoshManVGH> Breaker is off
[0:45:03] <%KeiganOfAstora> no
[0:45:06] <$lumporr> no it means ur short lol
[0:45:06] <%BubbaRands> kinda?

[0:45:15] <MacMog> you probably need to climb to the top floor, throw the can of fruit juice down the trash chute, and then go to the basement to retrieve the crank from the chute

[0:45:17] <aiutare47> the circut is complete but its not going where its supposed to
[0:45:17] <ToneBacas> good
[0:45:18] <%rumtumtugnutz> Probably popped the gfi
[0:45:19] <%ClericOfSparda> you need to replace that dimmer

[0:45:26] <%baka_sugoi> yes lol
[0:45:28] <%Maids4lyfe> smart
[0:45:31] <%Emperor_Machinus> You spilled your electricity and need to mop it up from within the wall
[0:45:32] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Maybe a bit overzealous, but good
[0:45:33] <+JustToWatch> make sure to lick the fork before you cram it in the socket
[0:45:35] <Aydarkzero> i've been electrocuted
[0:45:35] <ExpressNode> You need a volt tester even when turning it off

[0:45:42] <%baka_sugoi> osha
[0:45:44] <Profmcstevie> "wakes me up when I get the little shock"
[0:45:45] <%Forente> that would do it
[0:45:45] <%Pookiedaexzile> What cruel Irony
[0:45:45] <%walternatorz> you gotta keep the battery charged somehow
[0:45:47] <%KeiganOfAstora> yea.....
[0:45:48] <wolfen091> short just means electricity has a path to ground, tripped breaker will keep electricity from going to switch
[0:45:49] <nevan_44> cool with it?!
[0:45:50] <ohm_wrecker127> I bet if you turn the switch off you can use the circuit again aside from that light
[0:45:51] <%captain_thickthighs> we just don't know your gauge on practical stuff, some streamers run the gambit
[0:45:51] <%ThirdWelles> Shorted just means that the circuit  connected in a place that it wasn't supposed to.
[0:45:55] <%linSP> he better wear gloves
[0:45:56] <LordOfThePoultry> LUL
