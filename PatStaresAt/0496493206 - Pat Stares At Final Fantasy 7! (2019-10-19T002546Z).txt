[0:03:47] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat that looks like a bitrate/throughput issue, dude. Audio's coming through fine because it's the lowest bitrate portion of the signal, but the video is getting interrupted. If you open OBS stats pane, it'll tell you exactly where you're dropping - either cpu (encode), gpu (render) or network (self-explanatory)
