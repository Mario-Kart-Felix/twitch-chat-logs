[0:20:16] <sonofthedeepsouth> SONG OF THE ANCIENTS SwiftRage
[0:20:19] <RWLJr98> Is Nier lore as complicated as I hear Kingdom Hearts lore is?
[0:20:21] <katzroy56> it's a cone
[0:20:24] <$RealThiele> side pie
[0:20:27] <Kain5707> Pat just turn Grit off

[0:20:35] <T_Sasquatch> I'll be hnoest nier and automata music just mixes in , i can barely tell the difference
[0:20:37] <+evbites> @RWLJr98 no?
[0:20:39] <nevan_44> get rekt LUL
[0:20:45] <shieldecho> This is the most strangely relaxing stream I've watched in a while, and I'm fairly certain the music is a  huge part of that
[0:20:47] <%Blackleafx> tank tug of war
[0:20:49] <umbraawitch> tank not doing jobs POG
[0:20:54] <$RealThiele> no tanking for you
[0:20:58] <2Bs_USB_port> the duty finder experience
[0:20:59] <%toriauru> Dear Pat - think about you and Paige every day (I live in Quebec too) and worry about you. Hope Paige is doing ok after her first vacc. shot. Give Elmo and Zeif a boop on the nose from this cat lady. (((hugs)))
[0:21:03] <%the22cstomp> why is pat the most competent tank?????
[0:21:04] <penitentpendant> Oh Boy
[0:21:07] <sonofthedeepsouth> Pat you need to pull
[0:21:07] <KatabolicRage> gotta love other tanks forcing you to fight them for aggro while they don't do their job
[0:21:07] <AurusD> nier lore is ultimately kinda simple
[0:21:09] <%ClericOfSparda> Oh my god this is pissing me off and I'm not even playing
[0:21:12] <AurusD> there's just... a lot
[0:21:14] <gnarly_memes_bro> I'm just glad I've got the free time to watch pat stre.for once
[0:21:17] <sonofthedeepsouth> Be that punching bag
[0:21:17] <%BoxNavy> rip to that one ninja on B
[0:21:21] <gnarly_memes_bro> *stream
[0:21:25] <AurusD> and it's a never-ending wellspring of sadness
[0:21:26] <mr_saturday93> Thank God my knowledge of nier keeps me from being from being confused af
[0:21:26] <%Blackleafx> Nier lore is simple stuff said with complicated words
[0:21:35] <$RealThiele> pat loves family speration see
[0:21:35] <+Deosier> that provoke not working thing happened a few times doing my run
[0:21:38] <garbageheaphound> So I should probably play Nier original huh
[0:21:41] <gnarly_memes_bro> the fact that it's the last nier raid is a cherry in top
[0:21:47] <%Blackleafx> Pat your friends are goblins
[0:21:58] <garbageheaphound> GUESS IM BUYING REPLICANT
[0:21:59] <+evbites> @garbageheaphound the remake comes out next week
[0:22:04] <Kain5707> monkaS they can see us
[0:22:09] <gnarly_memes_bro> but we in the chat ARE goblins
[0:22:13] <+terry_quest> rip pat
[0:22:14] <penitentpendant> Nope
[0:22:16] <%DedlokPM> @RWLJr98 there are web stories, stage plays, , a mobile game, and it spawned from a completely different game series that may be simultaneously a prequel AND a sequel. So yes, but it is actually handled well
[0:22:17] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[0:22:21] <+trizetacannon44> I rescued the other healer to their both of our deaths during this
[0:22:22] <%Puhff> This is all cuz they're Alliance C Kappa

[0:22:31] <MKII> it means swap places then sweep
[0:22:33] <katzroy56> cuz of the swirls
[0:22:34] <OkamiDude15> @garbageheaphound well the remake is coming out within the next week or so
[0:22:36] <$RealThiele> ok they invert the ability too

[0:22:50] <%Monkeyweed21> THIS IS SO GOOD FOR A MINIBOSS
[0:22:53] <sonofthedeepsouth> WTF
[0:23:00] <+bugz_munny> THATS A LOT OF DAMAGE

[0:23:06] <%ÏΩîÏΩîÍæ∏Îùº> MILLIONS ARE DEAD
[0:23:07] <$KnightAsteran> this isn't a miniboss
[0:23:08] <+LittleBigQuebec> it's not a miniboss
[0:23:08] <T_Sasquatch> multiple times in this raid i was just screaming
[0:23:09] <$RealThiele> this is harder than the 1st boss?
[0:23:10] <penitentpendant> @Monkeyweed21 3 charges on LB, it's a proper boss
[0:23:11] <+evbites> This is everything thats scares me about mmos
[0:23:13] <+LittleBigQuebec> 3LB bars
[0:23:15] <Frostilk> Gotta admire the tech, while dying LUL

[0:23:33] <%ÏΩîÏΩîÍæ∏Îùº> Alliance B doing nice
[0:23:33] <$RealThiele> not defended
[0:23:34] <umbraawitch> guys i dont think this is a miniboss
[0:23:35] <gnarly_memes_bro> shield is 100% absorb im pretty sure
[0:23:42] <umbraawitch> did you guys know that
[0:23:45] <hakumaribo> yeah the tank busters in this raid are bullshit, they do insane damage with cooldowns up
[0:23:52] <+mojopork4u> @evbites It progressively gets easier over time, the nerves & damage scale is only bad on the same patch it releases
[0:23:52] <reonome> F
[0:23:56] <%the22cstomp> absolutely nuked
[0:23:56] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[0:24:09] <$KnightAsteran> @hakumaribo so they're a tankbuster?
[0:24:21] <$KnightAsteran> in other news, water is wet
[0:24:26] <%walternatorz> should just focus the nonshield one
[0:24:29] <jorniev> WHAT about that song called end of the world
[0:24:34] <+projectmanatees> Healer lb 3 will be used

[0:24:42] <hakumaribo> @KnightAsteran they do more damage then most tank busters in the game with cooldowns up.
[0:24:44] <+evbites> @mojopork4u no i mean i'm scared of the genre
[0:24:44] <danraven> discs go brrrrr
[0:24:49] <sirtommygunn> lmao the way this fight conditions you
[0:24:51] <gnarly_memes_bro> the shield is a full absorb, you can only hurt one at a time
[0:24:52] <$RealThiele> only 2 ate shit not bad

[1:02:22] <%Blackleafx> @PatStaresAt does this make everything FFXIV has ever crossed over with canon to the Drakengard universe, by shared multiverse theory?
[1:02:23] <mimi777> is he going to play mmsq on stream?
[1:02:23] <mr_saturday93> CANON
[1:02:24] <AoiRob> ENDING F

[1:02:55] <%skizzuto> OH SHIT the one 9S gets on with the machines?
[1:02:58] <Devbob98> Is that there memories now
[1:02:59] <%0rond> The arc is when the machines wanted to send their consciousness to space, they asked 9S if he wanted to join
[1:03:02] <AurusD> did the ROBOTS MAKE THE SEEDS
[1:03:04] <+fetrigon> wat
[1:03:07] <heartlesshealer> 8 )

[1:03:25] <%Xelhesia> WAIT THAT MEANS

[1:03:29] <Man_in_the_Red> Time is a Flat Circle
[1:03:31] <Blank9> they could probably make an emulation of a seed
[1:03:31] <mudapersona> Imagine Adam and Eve are on the moon waiting for us in Endwalker
[1:03:31] <aoiyume> THE RED EYES
[1:03:33] <+bugz_munny> JUST LET CLEMPS HELP

[1:03:50] <+BIumen> @superc37 those were just aliens :)
[1:03:50] <rosemon5001> what do you think are the chances the remake is actually another city from one of the other popola and devola models were tasked whit?
[1:03:50] <%President_Miyazaki> Red Girls didn't make the arc, other robots did. Cut off from the network.
[1:03:50] <Zebroneath> CLEMPS IS ON IT
[1:03:51] <Tracazoid> Clemps will explain it to us all in due time
[1:03:51] <+Rorkdork> clemps
[1:03:51] <%valriot> Is this reall,y ENDING F-F LUL LUL
[1:03:51] <EndCrawler> the story isn't over we still got a few weeks to get there
[1:03:52] <+TheNoidBag> @PatStaresAt It's more likely the Machines are mimicking the Watchers and their shit, given the whole thing about the Machines is they copy others.
[1:03:52] <heartlesshealer> ENJOY BRAIN
[1:03:52] <%Beough> GET CLEMPS IN HERE
[1:03:53] <AoiRob> is this Homestuck
[1:03:54] <sjcodan> CLEMPS RAN IT EARLIER TODAY, GET HIM ON THE PODCAST
[1:03:55] <AurusD> CLOSED TIME LOOP?!
[1:03:55] <@SSaryn> Not only is this modeled after a Seed of Resurrection/Destruction, it's a digital replication OF SAID THING.
[1:03:56] <+AutechreTwinAphex> yeah this kind of shit is what made Vaati rich
[1:03:57] <+GrandmasterBFunk> Is... the Tower a device to make a seed oof destruction?
[1:03:59] <+fetrigon> fuck it
[1:04:04] <%superc37> BUT THE MACHINES WERE MADE BY ALIENS WHO KNEW NOTHING ABOUT THIS
[1:04:04] <$RealThiele> Lali- shits fucked -ho!
[1:04:05] <+Shoosler> JUST IMAGINE BECAUSE I LITERALLY JUST CANT EVEN RIGHT NOW
[1:04:09] <Raz_Pataz> this is a bit confusing having never touched a Nier game ngl
[1:04:10] <%asgard147> Good job Pat limesOk
[1:04:12] <%Garthunox> thats probably best
[1:04:20] <gunstars20> LUL LUL
[1:04:20] <T_Sasquatch> honesly i found the quests after the raid to be horrendously boring
[1:04:21] <@SSaryn> It's not only a portal between worlds, which could meld things together WITHIN SAID WORLDS, but I CAN'T FUCKING PARSE IT
[1:04:22] <%Blackleafx> YOKO TARO HAPPENED
[1:04:22] <+Noir_Valdr> yeah that's about right
[1:04:24] <T_Sasquatch> i couldnt continue
[1:04:25] <%JoshManVGH> @thenoidbag oh that's a good read
[1:04:25] <mr_saturday93> LUL
[1:04:29] <Chimeraelite> LUL
[1:04:36] <%Foxsploder> *gestures broadly*
[1:04:36] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Yoko Taro, please come out and explain it to us
[1:04:39] <sjcodan> WoL IS SMARTER THAN (YOU)
[1:04:41] <GingerSen> Metaphysics is a thing in this land
[1:04:42] <%asgard147> THANKS YOKO
[1:04:43] <SaltyAzteca> YE
[1:04:43] <+Rorkdork> shit was fucked
[1:04:44] <%miguelrod777> the wol understood it all
[1:04:45] <Devbob98> Did you fuck a dragon?
[1:04:45] <+bugz_munny> we are the Dig Site cheif
[1:04:46] <$RealThiele> orb is trouble smart
[1:04:49] <AoiRob> they should have flashed "ENDING [F]inal [F]antasy" on screen
[1:04:57] <+GrandmasterBFunk> @superc37 The machines have a lot of data on humans and the human world, it's why they want to "become as gods", humans are a mythical god to them.
[1:05:01] <Paranoid_Jumbotron> pat did you do the MSQ for this patch yet?
[1:05:02] <%Blackleafx> also I really need to watch Clemps stream of this now to see what he says about it
[1:05:07] <Supervoli> man if you didn't play nier all of this means fucking nothing LUL LUL
[1:05:19] <AtisutoCurry> Anyone else have pats stream randomly repeating itself?
[1:05:26] <+evbites> @Supervoli YUP
[1:05:28] <+bugz_munny> But the humans are dead, ie god is dead its all very depressing
[1:05:29] <$RealThiele> that guys wife is dead
[1:05:50] <+bugz_munny> and thats just the nier side of things
[1:05:55] <Devbob98> But you‚Äôre alive and that‚Äôs all that matters
[1:05:55] <%ChestMimik> "I'm a coward" *ROCK MUSIC*
[1:05:56] <Raz_Pataz> very cool
[1:06:03] <Supervoli> @Supervoli SICK
[1:06:05] <Paranoid_Jumbotron> yeah this nier raid is WAY better than the first 2
[1:06:05] <SaltyAzteca> and rhythm games!
[1:06:07] <%caramelatte1> Instant kill buildings
[1:06:08] <$RealThiele> the building animation was hot
[1:06:09] <+ApocalypticExpress> Now do diamond weapon
[1:06:10] <+Noir_Valdr> IT DID THE RYTHYM
[1:06:12] <penitentpendant> That Kingdom Hearts 2 moment
[1:06:15] <+bugz_munny> The third boss is probably my favorite mechanically
[1:06:18] <+Noir_Valdr> AND ZERO
[1:06:23] <rosemon5001> very kingdom heartsy boss fight
[1:06:26] <%ssjklyco> FFXVI is going to be a sequel to the Raid, watch
[1:06:27] <+Kiaayo> it was 2p and the red girl combined but she was zero also
[1:06:27] <%Valdorick> Yeah, Zero got it rough
[1:06:32] <AurusD> that theme kinda broke me, too
[1:06:32] <+fetrigon> I CAN'T BELIEVE ZERO
[1:06:38] <+JustBlubs> It looked like 2B with the Red Girl's head glued to the top of her
[1:06:44] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt it had 2P and the Red Girl's heads
[1:06:45] <+fetrigon> ZERO I LOVE YOU COME BAAAAAACK
[1:06:53] <%Aeogard> the bells in the music NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[1:06:54] <%logoth_> a letter from ANON?
[1:06:57] <+GrandmasterBFunk> It actually looks a lot more like 2B up close, but all of the flowers and stuff indicate Zero was definitely involved in whatever they made.
[1:06:59] <+Rorkdork> I hope we get ports of drakengard 3
[1:06:59] <reonome> ISEKAI
[1:07:00] <%Valdorick> Remember the implication that Zero got tainted after the end of the world, and then got sent back in time to infect the world!?
[1:07:03] <Blank9> Zero becomes a grotesquery queen in drakengard 3's last end
[1:07:05] <%valriot> Thats also a Lunar Tear, aka the Kaine flower
[1:07:13] <$RealThiele> shes alive in tokyo
[1:07:13] <+BIumen> the faces were 2P and the Girl
[1:07:14] <+projectmanatees> Yeah was more 2b then zero
[1:07:17] <Solidus_113> God I hope Drakengard 3 gets released from the PS3
[1:07:22] <Yakobro> :)
[1:07:24] <EndCrawler> LUL
[1:07:25] <SaltyAzteca> YOU TEASE
[1:07:26] <%ChestMimik> How rude
[1:07:27] <%AzureGale> THE SUSPENSE

[1:07:31] <%miguelrod777> LUL
[1:07:31] <iosephe> letterblocked
[1:07:31] <+D00msDayDan> THERE'S NO TIME
[1:07:33] <penitentpendant> She's in the latest Nier game
[1:07:35] <Man_in_the_Red> @solidus_113 ... maybe for the best it doesnt Kappa
[1:07:37] <%0rond> @BIumen I mean without colors you can't really differentiate 2P and 2B
[1:07:40] <shieldecho> We'll find out what it says in the final week, don't worry
[1:07:43] <Finakala> Drakengard 3 needs a remaster
[1:07:43] <%AzureGale> And they will reveal what it said at a pivotal moment later
[1:07:46] <EndCrawler> they doing it on purpose these fuckers LUL
[1:07:47] <%Jaxnos> tbf everyone, it looking like 2B and Zero, while Kaine's theme plays, isn't a weird coinky-dink
[1:07:49] <%asgard147> YOKO WILL TOTALLY MAKE THIS A PLOT POINT IF HE MAKES ANOTHER NEIR GAME
[1:07:51] <+fetrigon> NO TIME
[1:07:52] <TioXyco> CAN WE GET A HIGH RESOLUTION LETTER AND READ IT PLEASE!
[1:07:53] <%Garthunox> She went to Smash Bros
[1:07:58] <%rottingpastry> sorry, you'll have to watch a limited series on fuji tv to hear the letter
[1:07:58] <%Valdorick> "Nier was invited to Smash. I'm going with them to be a stage asset. You may not understand this, but I know someone will"
[1:07:59] <gnarly_memes_bro> ahhh I love this song
[1:08:00] <Supervoli> NO LORE FOR YOU STINKY
[1:08:05] <+BIumen> @BIumen i mean yeah but the orb was spitting out lots of 2P's. idk i guess either really works.
[1:08:06] <%logoth_> There's no time
[1:08:11] <%JoshManVGH> Is Konogg about to punch a hole into space-time?
[1:08:23] <%Monkeyweed21> You only got the Ending A lore so far
[1:08:26] <+bugz_munny> I wouldnt mind a Drakengard with good gameplay
[1:08:28] <eiyuusyndrome> does soul calibur happen now
[1:08:31] <EndCrawler> imagine if anogg just shows up in replicant
[1:08:38] <$RealThiele> he gonna cause problems
[1:08:41] <reonome> read the goddamn letter konogg
[1:08:41] <%0rond> @PatStaresAt do you think it's possible the update to Nier automata will add a Anogg NPC?
[1:08:59] <%asgard147> oh limesFeels
[1:09:04] <%iam_acasual> just popping in right now. has he done the raid yet?
[1:09:05] <penitentpendant> She was added to Nier Reincarnation
[1:09:05] <%velemi> that's for the Drakengard remake
[1:09:06] <%KorieTheCoward> So is Sol cal a thing now?
[1:09:07] <Ciglossonjr> Watch anogg show up in Nier 1.22
[1:09:10] <+GrandmasterBFunk> Hey, this means that there is a Lalafell in the Nier Universe
[1:09:11] <+AutechreTwinAphex> does Patt have what it takes to suffer through Drakengard 1 onstream?
[1:09:16] <+TheotherKristian> I hope Yoko is straight up lying to us about Papa Nier
[1:09:32] <+Faultlined> I hear a Snoring baby
[1:09:33] <+BIumen> Papa Nier is WoL
[1:09:35] <%logoth_> running!
[1:09:35] <Supervoli> WHATS IN THE LETTER KONOGG
[1:09:36] <Parapattern> Portado
[1:09:37] <+bugz_munny> I mean Garuda shows up in FF15 - stranger things have happened
[1:09:37] <%ChestMimik> @GrandmasterBFunk They spread
[1:09:38] <%superc37> i have a feeling he isnt tbh.
[1:09:42] <%SShen> oooh diamond drogon right there
[1:09:45] <+Rorkdork> is that snoring
[1:09:45] <+mojopork4u> Nier has too much integrity than too lean too hard in "rememberberry SoulCalibur/FFXIV etc."
[1:09:47] <sjcodan> Is Replicant gonna be "Just" a remake?
[1:10:00] <%superc37> so... was that it?
[1:10:03] <+bugz_munny> they cleaned up the combat
[1:10:03] <%Grimlockfly> @sjcodan no
[1:10:04] <penitentpendant> @TheotherKristian Bonus points if The [Spoiler]Lord uses the papa Nier model
[1:10:05] <+Dragon4234> @AutechreTwinAphex The only way anybody could stream Drakengard 1 is to pump up the music so loud it drowns everything out
[1:10:08] <%Monkeyweed21> wtf is ending B of this gonna be?
[1:10:12] <mudapersona> Anogg: Fuck this Fantasy shit im, outter here
[1:10:13] <+Rorkdork> I bet they will add somethings to the replicant remake
[1:10:17] <%doc_ock_rokc> no i doubt it
[1:10:19] <$RealThiele> to the tokyo dimension
[1:10:23] <Man_in_the_Red> i mean, theres at least 23% more content in 1.22 Kappa
[1:10:27] <%Valdorick> 2b and 9s show up during Ending [F]Inal Fantasy
[1:10:27] <+mojopork4u> Nier 1.22 whatever is literally Nier: The Square Root of 1.5
[1:10:28] <%superc37> @penitentpendant what, you mean the shadowlord?
[1:10:31] <rosemon5001> i think replicant will be one of the other identical citys
[1:10:35] <Tracazoid> Of course it's not, if Yoko Taro doesn't add more to Nier's wild ride with Replicant I'll be damned surprised
[1:10:39] <%asgard147> Knowing Yoko, he'll make it a point to point out how weird a remake would be
[1:10:41] <penitentpendant> @superc37 Yup
[1:10:42] <blackbookalpha> the spoiler is in the game title lol
[1:10:45] <%Garthunox> i wonder if the tree place will be playable this time
[1:10:47] <%Grimlockfly> Pat gonna hop in a spaceship and shoot some credits now
[1:10:50] <+AutechreTwinAphex> @Dragon4234 Peeve tried it some time ago, he played it as a kid but he felt it aged like dogshit
[1:10:54] <reonome> booo
[1:10:56] <SaltyAzteca> YOUUUUUUUUUUU
[1:11:00] <%superc37> spoilers: its a video game
[1:11:00] <Supervoli> buuh
[1:11:01] <$RealThiele> pay me
[1:11:02] <+Noir_Valdr> THIS. CANNOT. CONTINUEEEE
[1:11:02] <+AutechreTwinAphex> which TBH is completely fair
[1:11:08] <%Jaxnos> imagine if yoko taro managed to convince them to change the final raid boss each week. that would be some wild ish.
[1:11:11] <+TheotherKristian> @penitentpendant "I have updated the final boss so that it is me, Yoko Taro" Yoko Taro
[1:11:18] <garbageheaphound> missed fun dialogue

[1:11:37] <Gebob> This isn't supposed 2b like this
[1:11:39] <penitentpendant> @TheotherKristian Don't be ridiculous! ...he'd be the optional superboss, obviously
[1:11:44] <+Rorkdork> you will change events in the weekly quests
[1:11:45] <AurusD> chief is accord
[1:11:46] <+AutechreTwinAphex> I will still defend Drakengard 1's soundtrack tho, it's awful on purpose and as mood building, it's actually kinda genius
[1:11:48] <Tracazoid> "Time to kill God"- The Dwarf, probably. *Cuts to you killing the FFXIV staff along with Yoko Taro*
[1:11:50] <%JoshManVGH> Patron, we gotta go back Parton... to the Future!
[1:11:52] <+fetrigon> GOTTA THE RAID 4 MORE TIMES

[1:11:53] <+BIumen> yeah it said the raid was complete but not the whole story arc

[1:12:56] <%ÏΩîÏΩîÍæ∏Îùº> "I can't relax until we hang SOMEONE to dry"
[1:13:02] <+Kiaayo> @GrandmasterBFunk the only thing this raid is missing is a mean, foul-mouthed woman
[1:13:05] <StarMechV> this dialogue is SO Taro
[1:13:06] <%BoxNavy> yes
[1:13:07] <%valriot> LUL
[1:13:09] <+BIumen> they are apparently just like this
[1:13:09] <%ChestMimik> It might be time to pull an Itachi
[1:13:11] <AurusD> wait is glagg a robot???
[1:13:11] <%velemi> they always have tbh
[1:13:11] <+LittleBigQuebec> oh these dwarves are twitter users got it
[1:13:13] <AtisutoCurry> what a bunch of assholes we just saved
[1:13:15] <+fetrigon> wtf
[1:13:17] <%AJ_Cherenkov> Very Taro tho
[1:13:18] <Ciglossonjr> There‚Äôs something wrong with these villagers, as in Ithink they‚Äôre fake
[1:13:18] <AurusD> am I a robot?
[1:13:18] <+senfood> Oh hey, Taro wrote this.
[1:13:18] <+bugz_munny> yeah this is very Taro
[1:13:18] <Saltmeisterr> wtf are with these drawfs
[1:13:18] <+gutlesscoward> yeah, I thought that was obvious
[1:13:19] <Visorak6> Thats the Taro writing I think
[1:13:19] <%WhereIsWill> truth
[1:13:20] <%Valdorick> The Watchers speak to them. Lalala, lalalalala
[1:13:23] <devanmuse> Almost like someone else wrote the dialogue?
[1:13:25] <+pectusumbra> infected? Genocide the dwaves?
[1:13:25] <%ssjklyco> Like Tokyo wasn't out of place?
[1:13:27] <sendart> Are these machines in disguise?
[1:13:28] <%Deft_Thought> Spoken like a true lynch mob.
[1:13:28] <%asgard147> They ARE Robots limesS
[1:13:29] <shieldecho> Did Taro write this part as well?
[1:13:29] <%Macguffn> turns out you're still in the raid
[1:13:29] <penitentpendant> Isolationist gotta isolationist
[1:13:30] <Kogashiwakai> this story in general tbh,
[1:13:30] <SaltyAzteca> just like they would in a NieR game, you think?
[1:13:33] <%velemi> there's a reason tomra has an aetheryte and they dont
[1:13:33] <%walternatorz> That's because Komra are the inferior dwarves
[1:13:33] <Raz_Pataz> to be fair the dwarves don't have a great track record
[1:13:37] <+fetrigon> da fuck is wrong with you
[1:13:38] <+D00msDayDan> someone should take the fall, but not me tho
[1:13:39] <+ApocalypticExpress> SUS

[1:13:59] <%HiroTSK5> Are these shades
[1:14:01] <+Noir_Valdr> there is something seriously weird about this
[1:14:02] <Kogashiwakai> doomsaying dwarf is always funny tho
[1:14:02] <Blank9> they're sounding like the junk heap brothers in nier
[1:14:11] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Jokes on you, I don't have any friends HAH
[1:14:11] <SaltyAzteca> These D type Dwarves
[1:14:12] <%ssjklyco> Are they going to have a fuck orgy?
[1:14:17] <reonome> no? this is a videogame
[1:14:17] <+silentblast93> also sup pat hows the children?
[1:14:18] <StarMechV> are WE real, Pat?
[1:14:21] <+Noir_Valdr> are they all constructs?
[1:14:24] <%velemi> yes komra is just full of assholes
[1:14:26] <GeltonZ> I think they're robots.
[1:14:26] <%0rond> I hope they are fake because they deserve to suffer
[1:14:27] <sjcodan> I'm real.
[1:14:27] <%amused_platypus> No wonder the dwarves are beast tribe in this expansion
[1:14:27] <%BioHunter> almost too real imo
[1:14:30] <+NYCrownlessKing> these dwarves have always been assholes
[1:14:31] <blitzmentalist> how can mirrors be real
[1:14:34] <Absurd_Lizard> Pat dosent know he's not real
[1:14:34] <+Dragon4234> @PatStaresAt Is any of 14 real?
[1:14:36] <+D00msDayDan> i don't know final fantasy, are dwarves a thing or were these guys introduced by yoko?
[1:14:41] <%ÏΩîÏΩîÍæ∏Îùº> What town? You've been talking to yourself all along...
[1:14:41] <Ciglossonjr> Holy shit
[1:14:41] <+fetrigon> LUL
[1:14:42] <dunkle321> So aggressive, you don't think it's the red eye shit right?
[1:14:43] <FinetiConfetti> That would have some weird implications with the beast tribe quests if true
[1:14:44] <+projectmanatees> I think this tribe is the one that loves war
[1:14:46] <ItsPastas> Nah, dwarves are asses usually
[1:14:46] <%Xelhesia> I DOUBT IT
[1:14:47] <%Nordguy> they're all impostors
[1:14:48] <%Garthunox> Was shadowbringers real?
[1:14:48] <gunstars20> LUL
[1:14:48] <Psyramics> people from this town were in the dwarf tribe quests, so yeah
[1:14:51] <Vyneci> ...this song is called Widespread Illness btw
[1:14:51] <+NYCrownlessKing> there lalafels @D00msDayDan
[1:14:52] <DianaTheAscian> the chief is nice at least
[1:14:53] <$TallYoda08> LUL
[1:14:53] <%ChestMimik> Swing and a miss
[1:14:54] <rosemon5001> wouldnt it be fucking weird if they were reincarnated watchers
[1:14:55] <%Valdorick> Dwarves are from FF9
[1:14:55] <+Noir_Valdr> what
[1:14:55] <sjcodan> THATS NOT HOW THIS WORKS
[1:14:56] <%logoth_> KILL GLAGG
[1:14:56] <%JoshManVGH> They taught you how to build a tank. and now you question their judgement?
[1:14:58] <%Valdorick> ...and FF1
[1:15:00] <reonome> LUL
[1:15:00] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Wouldn't even need a big window
[1:15:00] <penitentpendant> "There's a cliff... Right there... I can just yeet you in."
[1:15:01] <Tracazoid> They're all exhibiting 9S' quality of, "wait did you just say that?" whenever 9S got robo racist
[1:15:02] <GeltonZ> @D00msDayDan Dwarves show up occasionally but rarely.
[1:15:02] <SaltyAzteca> MUTINY
[1:15:04] <Zebroneath> kick them all like a football
[1:15:06] <+Noir_Valdr> oh fuck these guys
[1:15:07] <%President_Miyazaki> Pat just because you get kicked out of a window doesn't mean you should kick others out.
[1:15:08] <%ChestMimik> HOW?!
[1:15:08] <%velemi> LUL
[1:15:08] <blitzmentalist> @D00msDayDan yeah Dwarves are a thing in FF1 and FF4, these ones are Lalafell of the First
[1:15:09] <atsu333> They feel out of place in Eorzea, but I don't think they're that off for Norvrandt
[1:15:10] <%Deft_Thought> Wha
[1:15:14] <younger54> sounds legit
[1:15:17] <+GrandmasterBFunk> i fucking love "I was so sure of myself until i actually thought about it, fuck you!"
[1:15:27] <+fetrigon> huh?
[1:15:29] <Supervoli> MAN THESE GUYS STINK
[1:15:39] <sjcodan> NUKE THE FIRST
[1:15:39] <+fetrigon> wtf
[1:15:43] <%ChestMimik> His name is "Dig Site CHief"
[1:15:44] <JeysJumbleJams> solution: kill 'em all
[1:15:44] <%JoshManVGH> Why do they all gave GG in their names?
[1:15:46] <+fetrigon> LUL
[1:15:46] <%walternatorz> I thought you said "Dick side chief."
[1:15:48] <+Noir_Valdr> I am so confused
[1:15:54] <%Mr_Pylon> these dwarves are desperate for a witch hunt
[1:15:55] <SaltyAzteca> Accountability, the bitter pill
[1:15:57] <%toastybites> someone could have got lynched
[1:15:58] <+Noir_Valdr> which I guess is on brand for Nier
[1:15:59] <%asgard147> limesThink
[1:16:05] <zettig> The Dig Site Chief's name is Yoko Taro
[1:16:06] <blitzmentalist> @sjcodan bring back the Seed to wipe out Komra again. just Komra.
[1:16:08] <dunkle321> BIG YOKO TARO
[1:16:10] <dunkle321> I love it
[1:16:10] <%maskofmichael> Where are we going?
[1:16:11] <%walternatorz> Did you expect anything less?
[1:16:16] <sjcodan> Is Taro talking to THE PLAYER?
[1:16:19] <Tracazoid> Really strange and Yoko Taro go together like Ash Williams and Chainsaws
[1:16:20] <penitentpendant> Yeah, Anogg is a character in Nier Reincarnation. I just found the art again.
[1:16:21] <%DedlokPM> "First name Dig, Last Chief, middle Site."
[1:16:24] <tanithmagnus> to a program from the sound of it
[1:16:25] <+D00msDayDan> maybe there's a particular kind of mold that grows around here that drives them mad
[1:16:25] <%JoshManVGH> does not compute
[1:16:32] <%garatrose1> This is my first ever ff14 stream so i'm just as confused as you.
[1:16:33] <+mojopork4u> People are cruel, it kinda mirrors the state of society now. Can't just talk people down from public bloodthirst
[1:16:34] <%Xelhesia> i am scared to know how this ends
[1:16:38] <+silentblast93> ok as a black guy why are the elves have a fucking vanta black skintone
[1:16:45] <%ChestMimik> @DedlokPM You say the whole thing, like A Pimp Named Slickback
[1:16:55] <Supervoli> violent delights and all
[1:16:57] <%caramelatte1> acting like a tweeter person
[1:16:57] <%RetroCop87> @PatStaresAt it feels strange because yoko taro always ends his games before it gets to the survivors picking up the pieces
[1:17:01] <sjcodan> @silentblast93 They aren't, its a helmet
[1:17:03] <+Kiaayo> @silentblast93 black mage references, it's shadows
[1:17:14] <+bugz_munny> btw yall the next quest is gated until next week
[1:17:14] <+silentblast93> ah
[1:17:15] <+JustBlubs> @silentblast93 They aren't their faces are covered in shadow
[1:17:24] <+bugz_munny> This is gonna end with a bit of a cutoff
[1:17:26] <sjcodan> They're just lala's in helmets
[1:17:32] <Ciglossonjr> This feels like a trap
[1:17:37] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[1:17:43] <%Mr_Pylon> what is happening
[1:17:51] <aoiyume> three weeks until yoko deletes our stuff
[1:17:51] <+Noir_Valdr> uhhhhh
[1:17:53] <+evbites> we come back to a lynching
[1:17:53] <lessthanhuman_tv> Chad walk
[1:17:58] <pokefan9956> kill them all, pat
[1:18:05] <%ChestMimik> "Talk the village down from a lynching" QUEST COMPLETE
[1:18:05] <%ClericOfSparda> That music wasn't ominous at all!
[1:18:13] <Ciglossonjr> They‚Äôre all going to be dead aren‚Äôt they
[1:18:15] <tanithmagnus> someone need to put this whole town of suicide watch
[1:18:16] <T_Sasquatch> It was this point i gave up , its so boring LUL
[1:18:16] <%rottingpastry> lali ho
[1:18:16] <+fetrigon> ok
[1:18:26] <+D00msDayDan> worlds to save and packages to deliver, i love self-aware MMO writing
[1:18:31] <+bugz_munny> this whole town is gonna murder each other
[1:18:33] <%DedlokPM> @silentblast93 constantly in shadow. even when light is directly on them. Also there are others like that like Vivi
[1:18:37] <AurusD> everyone here is offputting
[1:18:53] <+D00msDayDan> doom, you say?
[1:18:55] <+evbites> "they killed the children first"
[1:18:56] <AurusD> They're all hiding SOMETHING
[1:19:13] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> no DON'T
[1:19:14] <shieldecho> oh GREAT
[1:19:16] <T_Sasquatch> Yea sure ....
[1:19:17] <+Noir_Valdr> oh
[1:19:18] <%asgard147> THAT'S A TERRIBLE IDEA
[1:19:18] <%rottingpastry> become as gods
[1:19:19] <JeysJumbleJams> uh oh
[1:19:19] <%ChestMimik> Don't know about that one chief
[1:19:20] <+Noir_Valdr> oh no
[1:19:20] <sjcodan> AWFUL IDEA, LETS DO IT
[1:19:21] <%ssjklyco> They are Nierly done
[1:19:21] <+BIumen> he said the word
[1:19:22] <DexteraXIII> That's a really bad idea
[1:19:23] <T_Sasquatch> thats not a bad idea at all
[1:19:24] <%Mr_Pylon> no downside
[1:19:25] <%californaya> NotLikeThis
[1:19:25] <RogueMinja> Sounds like a horrible idea.
[1:19:26] <%JoshManVGH> They are all dressed exactly the same
[1:19:26] <Man_in_the_Red> surely wont end badly
[1:19:27] <%Caped_Eggy> Well well welll
[1:19:28] <blitzmentalist> S I M O N E
[1:19:28] <Srthunda> they saw 2b and want one of their own

[1:19:35] <%ShogunNoonto> no
[1:19:38] <%Xelhesia> oh no
[1:19:39] <+bugz_munny> THIS WONT GO WRONG
[1:19:40] <Supervoli> Amazing idea Chief...
[1:19:41] <%Garthunox> automatoes!
[1:19:41] <Devbob98> No downside!
[1:19:42] <%asgard147> They're all gonna die
[1:19:45] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> what are you talking about, how could this possibly backfire
[1:19:45] <Zebylth> wind up minions are automata pat
[1:19:49] <+fetrigon> NO IT'S GOOD
[1:19:51] <DianaTheAscian> I wonder if Woolies gonna do like a lets watch or something
[1:19:53] <+mojopork4u> Could be bad, could be an excuse to add Pascal music to the FFXIV overworld
[1:19:53] <Namillus> This would be a great idea if the entire DrakeNieR series didn't exist
[1:20:01] <SaltyAzteca> what could possibly go wrong?!
[1:20:08] <AurusD> logic virus talos???
[1:20:10] <%ChestMimik> Or violece, chief
[1:20:11] <sjcodan> Its like nuclear energy, its an awful idea, lets do it

[1:20:15] <dunkle321> These fuckers are just all drunk aren't they
[1:20:22] <%solracc25> Skynet
[1:20:25] <%Puhff> arse LUL
[1:20:29] <korpocalypse> @PatStaresAt is this character from another ff game or is it unique to XIV?
[1:20:30] <%JoshManVGH> Can they rebuild some of those Amusement Park machines, those were fun!
[1:20:34] <JeysJumbleJams> they're angry drunks
[1:20:40] <Man_in_the_Red> @namillus i mean, if scifi didnt exist it would be a good idea
[1:20:41] <%ChestMimik> "Rebuild their home"
[1:20:41] <DianaTheAscian> it's a sort of beast tribe
[1:20:42] <thetunnelhomer> A final "Go to hell" from Taro.
[1:20:42] <%Rumbutt> It is to make housing ONLY FOR POTATOES
[1:20:43] <sjcodan> Unique
[1:20:44] <%miguelrod777> yoko taro wtf
[1:20:48] <%HiroTSK5> I listening to the boss track and throughout the song the bells from Drakengard's final boss theme plays
[1:20:48] <%Rumbutt> KOMRA RESTORATION
[1:20:49] <+Noir_Valdr> this is a very curious way to "end" the raid series...
[1:20:55] <thetunnelhomer> You want story resolution, WEEKLY QUESTS
[1:20:55] <+silentblast93> Pat : this is such a bad idea  *grabs red bull 6 pack and popcorn*
[1:20:55] <+BIumen> badumtsh
[1:21:04] <+evbites> @Namillus oh you mean the series about innocent ideas ending in mass murder
[1:21:13] <+Noir_Valdr> choose your raid redo
[1:21:17] <%Xelhesia> this may turn out like Pascal's villiage :(
[1:21:17] <%jinking79> aren't those parts filled with viruses
[1:21:24] <%CalderGaming> and then yoko taro said, "what if we make the player help fix up the village afterwards with a weekly re-clear grind"
[1:21:24] <@SSaryn> Man I got some fucking theories working in my head already after thinking about it some more.
[1:21:24] <penitentpendant> Note: This isn't the raid, just hit up the area
[1:21:37] <%californaya> aren't we all filled with viruses
[1:21:38] <Supervoli> @jinking79 its fiiiiiine
[1:21:40] <%valriot> LUL Run Copied Factory
[1:21:40] <Devbob98> Robot Village volume 2
[1:21:40] <%velemi> just go back to the area
[1:21:44] <%rottingpastry> is that a grinding joke right in the quest title?
[1:21:45] <sjcodan> Go explore again
[1:21:47] <+Noir_Valdr> oh not a raid redo
[1:21:49] <+Noir_Valdr> hmm
[1:21:50] <TioXyco> so Komra is basically the Doman Enclave, huh? we gotta rebuild it
[1:21:50] <Man_in_the_Red> so, you like your dwarves Fried or mashed
[1:21:51] <%walternatorz> both options take you to copied factory
[1:21:53] <sjcodan> THE TOWN WILL NOT BLOW UP WHILE YOURE GON
[1:21:56] <sjcodan> RIGHT?
[1:21:57] <@SSaryn> So if my theory is correct, IT'S FUCKING MASSIVE
[1:21:57] <2Bs_USB_port> when the dwarves are sus
[1:21:59] <+bugz_munny> btw pat you can see the tower from here if you fly up
[1:22:01] <@SSaryn> CAUSE THIS LINKS
[1:22:03] <@SSaryn> LEGIT
[1:22:05] <+bugz_munny> pretty neat
[1:22:05] <Pookiedaexzile> It was all a lie PAt
[1:22:11] <+Noir_Valdr> this feels so weird
[1:22:12] <sjcodan> WE COMING BACK TO A CORPSE PILE
[1:22:15] <Man_in_the_Red> Potato Famine incoming
[1:22:16] <ItsPastas> Ah yes, the Komradian Restoration Proyect
[1:22:18] <korpocalypse> there needs to be a massively multiplayer online party game
[1:22:20] <penitentpendant> This MUST continue
[1:22:20] <%JoshManVGH> That village is about to get a tower for sure
[1:22:22] <+evbites> who wants dwarf kekbabs
[1:22:23] <sjcodan> Teleporte
[1:22:29] <%asgard147> These guys are ALL gonna be dead by the end of this, arn't they? limesS
[1:22:29] <+Noir_Valdr> are we rebuilding 2B
[1:22:30] <+BIumen> hey what the FUCK was with that corpse pile by the way
[1:22:30] <@SSaryn> WE NEVER SEE THE ABOVE SHINJUKU
[1:22:33] <%californaya> why is that falling sound so funny
[1:22:34] <sjcodan> U takin the looooong walk
[1:22:34] <hakma> yo wtf the nier factory is in FF world?
[1:22:37] <@SSaryn> WE DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S A SEED UP THERE
[1:22:39] <%valriot> MAKE A FAT ASS FROG ROBOT
[1:22:41] <tanithmagnus> of course
[1:22:46] <AurusD> so in 7.0 we get Korma housing, right
[1:22:47] <+RoByte2> "Oh yeah, the corpse room. That's a thing."
[1:22:48] <%Monkeyweed21> Are you building these Dwarves sex slave robots?
[1:22:52] <%ChestMimik> Ssaryn at risk
[1:22:57] <%superc37> @hakma i take it you just got here
[1:23:06] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[1:23:12] <+evbites> @Monkeyweed21 .....
[1:23:13] <hakma> @superc37 yeah why's there a nier factory there
[1:23:19] <@SSaryn> IF IT'S CORRECT, IT'S MASSIVE
[1:23:20] <korpocalypse> this game is beautiful
[1:23:22] <+wizard_of_diamonds> monkaGiga
[1:23:29] <+D00msDayDan> large if factual
[1:23:34] <%ChestMimik> @evbites Elipses won't hide you from the oily truth
[1:23:38] <sjcodan> BIG THONK
[1:23:40] <+GingerStrawhat> It's really strange to walk through raid locations by yourself
[1:23:41] <+AutechreTwinAphex> graphics look better than the base game TBH
[1:23:42] <Pookiedaexzile> Its not just Cannon its essential
[1:23:45] <+mojopork4u> The city definitely didnt have the copied aesthetic
[1:23:46] <Zollington> dont you see them go into shinjuku in a cutscene
[1:23:48] <Saltmeisterr> gigantic if correct
[1:23:49] <%superc37> @hakma i suggest watching part 1 of the raid to find out.
[1:23:49] <+bugz_munny> I thought nier was the result of the queen's death or something in drakengard 1's ending?
[1:23:49] <%asgard147> A Madman?
[1:23:50] <+BIumen> @PatStaresAt What if the Arc from Automata just smashed into a Seed and it vomitted all this stuff on Kholusia
[1:23:54] <%valriot> Wait, as in this started Nier Replicant? LUL LUL
[1:23:58] <@SSaryn> I legit checked a good portion of any main area where we see Shinjuku, including the opening sequence and the Shadowlords castle.
[1:24:01] <2Bs_USB_port> don't forget the RADIO DRAMA
[1:24:01] <+Noir_Valdr> ...ohhhh..."copied" factory...literally a copy...
[1:24:03] <@SSaryn> We NEVER see above.
[1:24:04] <+evbites> @sjcodan Oily truth thats a new one
[1:24:05] <@CreepyPorpoise> Pretty cool raid
[1:24:10] <Pookiedaexzile> It was amaazing
[1:24:10] <+GrandmasterBFunk> Those are books now tho, just poorly translated books
[1:24:12] <blackbookalpha> lol A2's whole arc is a stage play
[1:24:18] <+BIumen> why are there all these 2B's tho
[1:24:21] <2Bs_USB_port> check that corpse room
[1:24:21] <Devbob98> Hey some of the plays are cool
[1:24:22] <%ssjklyco> FF 16 will be a sequel to this event
[1:24:27] <%weissguard> creepy49Porpkek creepy49Porpkek creepy49Porpkek
[1:24:28] <%ChestMimik> Stubbys!
[1:24:28] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> well that was easy
[1:24:29] <bear_breaker20> just stopped caring before even really atarting too, now all i do is worship 2B's ass and 9S's thighs
[1:24:30] <thetunnelhomer> Anogg shows up in Nier Reincarnation.
[1:24:31] <+mojopork4u> behind youe!
[1:24:37] <dunkle321> He said this was canon too right?
[1:24:38] <Psyramics> I thought this meant run the raid twice, so I haven't done it yet
[1:24:43] <Man_in_the_Red> at least the stage play that matters is in automata
[1:24:44] <+Noir_Valdr> that was suspiciously easy
[1:24:49] <%DedlokPM> @dunkle321 yes
[1:24:51] <xx_black_mage> Do You ever miss Matt?
[1:24:56] <%asgard147> What could go wro-everything, literally everything could go wrong
[1:24:56] <+projectmanatees> It‚Äôs for the ironfrogs possibly
[1:25:03] <+GrandmasterBFunk> Like the book of all of the short stories and the A2 stage play gets the names of things wrong that are different from the game.
[1:25:03] <2Bs_USB_port> somehow worse than running it twice
[1:25:04] <penitentpendant> @dunkle321 Yup, Anogg shows up in Nier Reincarnation
[1:25:06] <%valriot> @mojopork4u WAIT WHAT? LUL
[1:25:12] <AllenDeadman> hmmm too easy...
[1:25:12] <%BoxNavy> oh fuck yeah
[1:25:18] <%AJ_Cherenkov> @xx_black_mage bruh
[1:25:20] <+projectmanatees> Easy weekly
[1:25:21] <%JoshManVGH> But what if content?
[1:25:33] <+silentblast93> raid day
[1:25:34] <EndCrawler> watch the next two quests be the longest quests LUL
[1:25:34] <mr_saturday93> I wonder if Nier receincartion is a interquel or a prequel to nier
[1:25:35] <blackbookalpha> A2 and Anemone had a whole arc, but its all in the stage play
[1:25:40] <+Noir_Valdr> ...it might
[1:25:43] <2Bs_USB_port> Kappa
[1:25:43] <%ChestMimik> We're NOT sure
[1:25:44] <pokefan9956> @xx_black_mage don't do that
[1:25:44] <%JoshManVGH> Maybe...
[1:25:47] <+mojopork4u> @valriot My Twitch stream bugged and it skipped from his picking up the first machine life form into him using the teleport to zone 1. Would've been a long walk LUL
[1:25:49] <sjcodan> More like Noose to share
[1:25:49] <+evbites> Whats the darkets ff14 has gone?
[1:25:52] <Devbob98> The A2 play is a manga now
[1:25:53] <sjcodan> Cause lynching
[1:25:55] <+Noir_Valdr> uh?
[1:25:56] <dunkle321> Wait how does this fit into canon then? Do we just not know when this happens?
[1:26:03] <+mmack093> Has he already finished the raid?
[1:26:05] <rosemon5001> im finding the dwarfs more and more sus they better not be watcher followers
[1:26:05] <+Noir_Valdr> uh oh
[1:26:11] <Goldenwolf98> ooooo a whatsit

[1:26:29] <DianaTheAscian> So so u know how many weekly quest this will take to finish? @PatStaresAt
[1:26:33] <+D00msDayDan> @rosemon5001 turns out they wear all that to cover up their black scrawl and red eyes
[1:26:35] <%0rond> konogg is the brother that's still in this world, anogg is the sister tha left to another world
[1:26:36] <neptious> Just finished the raid
[1:26:41] <+gantz_zero> 3 apparently @DianaTheAscian
[1:26:59] <@SSaryn> Ok the only one time we see above Shinjuku is what we assume to be the prequel to it all, being Drakengard 3. We fight Zero, which has been theorized to be the Queen Beast AND MIGHT HAVE MADE the Seeds of Destruction.
[1:27:06] <reonome> fuck thats still cool
[1:27:08] <Man_in_the_Red> maybe the dwarves were salt all along
