[0:13:24] <CandideCamera> Remember Pat, the new Commander Keen boy is in fact Doomguy, therefore HE has to be in Smash to win the bet

[0:13:35] <%Frost_Quill> Is Pat playing Yakuza or A Hat in Time first?
[0:13:37] <%CJett92> I like that Death Stranding is coming out before Cyberpunk
[0:13:38] <%DonatelloJose> I will cancel my suicide if Sans gets released for Smash. /s

[1:02:12] <Warbot40> Banjo 1 is such a smooth playthrough.
[1:02:16] <+masked_hero_lucky> This is WAY closer to Mario 64
[1:02:17] <%Solidnick18> @Michael_Erazo i'm pissed
[1:02:20] <MrCalieb> does banjo is gay
[1:02:23] <%spiritofmojave> Pat played it while he was a babbu and hated it, okay
[1:02:23] <%doc_ock_rokc> This game is the same genre
[1:02:24] <%ArcanumMBD> Pat would hate Banjo simply because of the controls
[1:02:24] <+StrawberryPantsu> Movement in Banjo is bad
[1:02:24] <%rumtumtugnutz> just karate chop him in the baby cannon
[1:02:28] <%FrustratedAF> banjo may have aged like shit

[1:02:40] <SomersaultJustice> paige, wanna play banjo kazooie out of spite?
[1:02:41] <+Darren716> Reminder that Pat had no childhood
[1:02:41] <%doc_ock_rokc> Way to take balls to the face pat
[1:02:42] <%supersugoisenpai1> Donkey Kong 64 is terrible
[1:02:42] <@commanderclaw> Same as FF7, it no longer holds up without nostalgia
[1:02:43] <%mayorrev> tootie
[1:02:43] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I went back and played it, and fuckin enjoyed it
[1:02:44] <Kristoffers> says man playing effin hat in time

[1:02:50] <thehornypastrypuffer> WRONG
[1:02:50] <troxcree> The witch just wants to be hot.
[1:02:50] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Pat, you shut your whore mouth about Banjo
[1:02:51] <dukenux> i have no stake in this, but this might be true
[1:02:51] <takiyami> Or anything with tank controls, really
[1:02:51] <narusao> nailed it
[1:02:51] <+logus313> Banjo is still fun.
[1:02:52] <%HentaiSenpai9K> Donkey Kong 64 is better than BANJO

[1:03:05] <+XxBTExX> Guntilda + Tootie = hot
[1:03:07] <%GohanEgret> good thing RE2 was improved in Darkside Chronicles Kappa
[1:03:07] <Kristoffers> Just play Banjo, Pat
[1:03:09] <+StrawberryPantsu> The music is good
[1:03:11] <CandideCamera> Pat wants to fuck Kazooie and is hiding it

[1:56:57] <+Xalgar> Battleship Waifu in the back PogChamp
[1:57:00] <%tigerfang86> IS HE THOUGH
[1:57:06] <%FrostMass22> Why does this look so low budget? is there a single cut scene where people's faces move?
[1:57:08] <jaytitan96> "This boat will be the NEW Tojo Clan Headquarters
[1:57:10] <@lewdskeletor13> I feel like the majority of this story is a subtory. All the main cast from previous games get sidelined
[1:57:12] <smallmiightt> So the secret is a boat that doesn’t work. Huh. That’s pretty rad
[1:57:12] <hassanico> Chat, is Iwami's tatoo a Kirin or a Hakutaku?
[1:57:17] <%tigerfang86> you're a MASSIVE DICK
[1:57:19] <h0wiewong> But he's the lesser evil
[1:57:21] <%Tearonex> Guys the stupid secret ship IS RIGHT THERE, how is anyone just fine with that!?
[1:57:25] <theobble> Nice boat

[1:57:40] <hassanico> THE FIXER
[1:57:44] <%arcaderabbit48> @lewdskeletor13 Friendly reminder that Majima, the Vergil of the series, is still in jail!
[1:57:46] <omen_setter> everyone in this town must die. they all saw the mark 2
[1:57:47] <%AstroFalcon09> Murduring kiryu LUL
[1:57:51] <%AstroFalcon09> Murdering*
[1:57:56] <hassanico> The Japanese Govenrment want Kiryu dead, holy shit
[1:57:57] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @MelBrooksKA It's legit the Yamato Mk 2 that was built in secret by the Okinawa yakuza post WWII.
[1:57:57] <%bread_assassin> Oh like you're perfect, Pat.
[1:57:58] <b_ikki> n a n d a t o
[1:57:58] <Monkeyweed21> He's dead in like a week
[1:57:58] <%krispen_wa> Nandato
[1:57:59] <%SWFanatic> NANI
[1:58:03] <%Tearonex> And a Tattoeless PANSY
[1:58:03] <%tigerfang86> IT'S HIM
[1:58:03] <%PhantomMiG> Kiryu would laugh about someone trying to murder him
[1:58:04] <切捨御免> what a gremlin
[1:58:05] <h0wiewong> MORE BETRAYEL
[1:58:05] <hassanico> RED JACKET MAN
[1:58:05] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> "I'm sneaky."

[1:58:07] <lloyddboy> SNEAKY
[1:58:09] <EMP_Ike_Turner> NOT KOICHI
[1:58:09] <devanmuse> that guy's still alive?!
[1:58:11] <%dheng1> Secret black project
[1:58:11] <%Solidnick18> Sneaking
[1:58:11] <%korth367> wait does this dude actually think kiryu is in danger of anything
[1:58:11] <%tigerfang86> it's LAME MAJIMA
[1:58:12] <%SWFanatic> BAKANA
[1:58:17] <%SWFanatic> Masaka Mark II
[1:58:18] <%krispen_wa> Nah he can't
[1:58:18] <%Mikers29> yeaaaaaaaaa "murder" Kiryu
[1:58:19] <Elofhousewood> Sneaky
[1:58:20] <alexandrecau> @Tearonex It's a big ass boat, only people that care is a dying dude, the embarassed politicians and baby iwami
[1:58:22] <MoulesFritz> if I were a yakuzi I would just give up until kiryu dies fo old age
[1:58:24] <%tigerfang86> Murdering Kiryu
[1:58:26] <%tigerfang86> h a h
[1:58:26] <%dheng1> Bakana mark 2
[1:58:27] <Valentinius_Anodyne> If the Tojo clan is on the Yamato II on the high seas, then they aren't illegal because the ocean is lawless!
[1:58:28] <%supersugoisenpai1> I killed like a hundred dudes once
[1:58:35] <hassanico> You know what Somea, you're cool
[1:58:37] <InugamiTheHound> that red jacket reminds me of that guy from yakuza 0 who made maxima go crazy
[1:58:46] <h0wiewong> Time to save the Tojo Clan AGAIN
[1:58:52] <@lewdskeletor13> I sure do love the fact that this story has almost none of the characters I care about!
[1:58:55] <jaytitan96> Someya, You're a swell guy
[1:58:55] <alexandrecau> @MoulesFritz Likely how yakuza 7 happens
[1:58:56] <%tigerfang86> fuck
[1:58:56] <+Mrlasttruth> is kiryu the fourth hokage? @angriestpat
[1:58:59] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Kiryu never killed anyone. Especially not that innocent waiter he used as a bullet shield
[1:59:02] <%AstroFalcon09> Now they have to be protecced
[1:59:02] <切捨御免> here i go killing again
[1:59:02] <%tigerfang86> now they've GOT to die
[1:59:03] <Dr_Mooose> No it's personal
[1:59:08] <Dr_Mooose> *now
[1:59:10] <dalishprince> time to murder!!
[1:59:11] <+TamaskaLem> Yeah he seems like a floozi yakuzi
[1:59:15] <Mangoesarentcats> Man I wish more of the old cast was here
[1:59:23] <EMP_Ike_Turner> Yakuza. Honor. Pick one
[1:59:24] <%Tearonex> @alexandrecau There should be hoards of reporters and shit
[1:59:25] <dalishprince> repay him with ur fists
[1:59:27] <%PopulousNix> You are going to die
[1:59:27] <%korth367> but we settled it two times already
[1:59:28] <+BishopBain> What a nice snake. Kappa
[1:59:28] <Sulliman34> god theres so much left to this game
[1:59:30] <MoulesFritz> @Mangoesarentcats most of the old cast is dead, man
[1:59:31] <hassanico> @lewdskeletor13 the game's not worse for establishing new characters
[1:59:32] <%tigerfang86> probably like 5
[1:59:35] <h0wiewong> Gotta go for the Vergil 3 fight
[1:59:45] <+Pookiedaexzile> Wrestling Lingo
[1:59:45] <indig0bird> "How many times do I have to teach you this lesson, young man?"
[1:59:46] <hassanico> @lewdskeletor13 and the absence of Majima, Daigo, etc is refreshing
[1:59:49] <%Alazull> Have you fought him on top of Millenium Tower?
[1:59:50] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> How many times does this old man have to teach you a lesson?
[1:59:50] <maverickdrifter> Nah man these dudes were cool. Idk I really enjoyed my time with it and I hear the issues, it just didn’t hinder the vibe for me
[1:59:50] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 2 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 8oz (240mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[1:59:51] <%dheng1> You have to beat someya black now
[1:59:55] <$Valdorick> HE HAS A GUN - SHOOT 'EM ALL
[1:59:55] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@Valdorick) (warning)
[1:59:56] <%Solidnick18> yeah
[1:59:58] <%krispen_wa> Nah but he was holding back tho
[1:59:58] <Mangoesarentcats> @MoulesFritz well that's true LUL
[1:59:59] <+Pookiedaexzile> But that don't matter on the Streets
[2:00:01] <Sulliman34> GUN
[2:00:03] <beetbo2> Till he’s ‘NOT’ dead
[2:00:05] <Valentinius_Anodyne> If Kiryu was pragmatic, he'd just beat him up now
[2:00:06] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> unless you beat him in the Millenium Tower it doesnt count
[2:00:08] <King_Wolf_Rigger> An HONOURABRU win
[2:00:08] <+Pookiedaexzile> Aint no ref in da skreets
[2:00:12] <%Alazull> Because until you fight him on top of that tower, it doesn't count
[2:00:15] <切捨御免> SourPls
[2:00:16] <alexandrecau> @Tearonex there already was a news coverage and the shipbuilder is dead, they don't know who to harass now
[2:00:16] <ahegotrigger> he even fought you not clean and lost
[2:00:18] <%spiritofmojave> Kiryu could've dropped out of this elaborate dumb plot involving a relic ship and Secret Chinese like 3 different times lmao
[2:00:21] <%dheng1> Rubber floor
[2:00:24] <%tigerfang86> you NEED to get on the tower pat
[2:00:24] <%bread_assassin> "So many times" Twice.
[2:00:27] <%tigerfang86> it's the ONLY WAY
[2:00:30] <%krispen_wa> The guys are in trouble!
[2:00:35] <MosesUnspoken> You need to beat him shirtless on the tower
[2:00:35] <Jolnir> youre better than me at this game, really look like you know what youre doing, i barely fucking made it through yakuza 0
[2:00:36] <%Alazull> Doesn't matter
[2:00:37] <@lewdskeletor13> This game is supposed to be the “end” of Kiryus story, yet it feels super disconnected from the rest of the series, sidelining Haruka, Majima, etc for a dumb boat story
[2:00:40] <@commanderclaw> It has to be at the Yakuiza eqivalent of Wrestlemania
[2:00:42] <Dementedpenguin> Oh god, the three stooges again
[2:00:45] <MoulesFritz> kiryu is a regular suit is a sin
[2:00:47] <%shinzm1911> I mean, that's basically a super win.
[2:00:48] <xiidrifty> No Shirts, Fists Only, Millennium Tower
[2:00:52] <ahegotrigger> this shit gets nuts
[2:00:56] <ahegotrigger> like bananas
[2:01:03] <%Alazull> I mean you literally fight your way past a dude who Pearl Harbors you on a motorcycle with a pipe
[2:01:04] <%tigerfang86> WHACHOW
[2:01:08] <alexandrecau> the trick is to grind
[2:01:08] <ahegotrigger> and its not e ven sunday
[2:01:11] <hassanico> The government wants Kiryu dead
[2:01:12] <%dheng1> No hold bars millennium tower
[2:01:13] <%Alazull> AND THAT DIDN'T COUNT
[2:01:14] <+Xalgar> Kappa Sure
[2:01:15] <MoulesFritz> so if kiryu is wearing a normal suit, can he still rip it off like stripper pants?
[2:01:19] <Dr_Mooose> *cough* grinded off screen *cough*
[2:01:19] <%Edgy_Macaroon> it's really easy tho
[2:01:19] <%SWFanatic> apatDab
[2:01:24] <h0wiewong> Oh no jobbers
[2:01:25] <+Deano8817> lp tax is super real
[2:01:26] <jaytitan96> Kiryu runs in "We have to go to The Millennium Tower and remove our clothes NOW"
[2:01:31] <alexandrecau> Is that the same dude again?
[2:01:32] <RupanSen> Yakuza games are pretty easy tbf
[2:01:32] <Sulliman34> what is LP tax
[2:01:33] <%rumtumtugnutz> the trick is, Pat is a ham sandwich.
[2:01:36] <$Valdorick> Nagimo, don't go out there when they might have GUNS
[2:01:39] <majindusto> LP TAX IS FAKE THO
[2:01:39] <+Xalgar> Kappa Whatever you say Pat
[2:01:40] <Valentinius_Anodyne> All things considered, Pat is surprisingly competent sometimes :)
[2:01:44] <b_ikki> @Sulliman34 when you play a game while trying to entertain it's hard to focus
[2:01:44] <%Solidnick18> yappai strap match millennium tower
[2:01:46] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @Sulliman34 Stage fright, pretty much.
[2:01:51] <hassanico> Just you wait...
[2:01:54] <theobble> That was still the greatest pachinko gameplay I've ever seen.
[2:01:54] <ovan20> NOT the JOBERS! D:
[2:01:57] <EMP_Ike_Turner> Oh it’s the nWo B team
[2:01:59] <beetbo2> Oh no, more bodies for the pilr
[2:01:59] <bear_breaker20> tfw jobber atpFeelsBeardMan
[2:02:00] <%spiritofmojave> is it the same fucking gang again
[2:02:00] <%shinzm1911> LP Tax = Performing live and why a lot of musicians get fucking drunk.
[2:02:05] <Monkeyweed21> no you didn't Pat
[2:02:06] <+Darren716> Its from waaaay before then
[2:02:07] <%kiiiirsten> lore
[2:02:13] <hassanico> Don't mess with Kiryu's family
[2:02:16] <Sulliman34> oh ok, thanks for the explanation pat
[2:02:22] <MoulesFritz> @AngriestPat if i were an evil yakuzi with plans for kamurocho I would just give up until kiryu dies of old age
[2:02:23] <%NovaKnightmare> Just become a robot and play the game automatically IDIOT
[2:02:26] <Jolnir> i mute everything and play in silence
[2:02:26] <+Demon_Reject> this one is for the murderer
[2:02:27] <h0wiewong> BIG G U N
[2:02:27] <$nitronLVIII> lp tax has existed since lps existed

[2:02:57] <beetbo2> Here we go, innocent people dead now
[2:02:57] <%weissguard> Nah, that dude's aim was just shit.
[2:02:57] <%Dovahthing> the rocket jobbed
[2:02:59] <%krispen_wa> WE'll take them all down!
[2:02:59] <%Edgy_Macaroon> this isn't your final firm?
[2:02:59] <NeroInfinite> get used to seeing rocket men for a bit
[2:03:00] <Valentinius_Anodyne> It's the reason why speedrunners who can provide commentary are super cool
[2:03:00] <+Deano8817> HOLY SHIT LUL
[2:03:00] <%Solidnick18> YE
[2:03:01] <alexandrecau> the hostess is dead
[2:03:02] <DougintheTrench> Oh no! The rocket only made them MAD.

[2:03:07] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> oh, I guess you're done with that rocket launcher now
[2:03:08] <%yoshkosh20> first line wiped
[2:03:10] <%Solidnick18> SourPls
[2:03:10] <%NovaKnightmare> was that a rocket or a Firecracker???
[2:03:12] <InugamiTheHound> how did they get a rocket launcher in japan?
[2:03:13] <falconx9k> PLANT
[2:03:13] <theobble> IDIOT SQUAD ENGAGE
[2:03:14] <devanmuse> they bring a rocket launcher, but don't just unload with machine guns? The hell?
[2:03:15] <%dheng1> They’re fine guys
[2:03:16] <%Solidnick18> SourPls SourPls
[2:03:16] <%spiritofmojave> Where'd these backwater thugs afford fucking RPGs
[2:03:17] <RupanSen> It's the reason Woolie can't talk why playing fighting games basically
[2:03:18] <beetbo2> Now kiryu’s GOTTA kill them
[2:03:18] <PortableBoredom> Pretty sure rocket launchers are just one shot, guys
[2:03:19] <h0wiewong> Man that rocket guy really screwed up his one shot
[2:03:20] <%megabrogus> holy shit this game is sick as hell
[2:03:20] <%shinzm1911> SUPER DEAD
[2:03:21] <MoulesFritz> lets be real, the missile would have done like a third of kiryus HP
[2:03:28] <b_ikki> SourPls
[2:03:29] <ameraaaaaa> the hostess is dead
[2:03:33] <%korth367> dead
[2:03:34] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Tell that to hob he no hit five games in a row while streaming and meming
[2:03:34] <+Xeno351> SEAMLESS TRANSITION
[2:03:34] <ameraaaaaa> shit
[2:03:34] <%weissguard> @spiritofmojave >Yakuza
[2:03:35] <ovan20> LUL
[2:03:36] <%Solidnick18> YE
[2:03:39] <trashkink> They are just leaving a rpg in the street wtf?
[2:03:42] <%shinzm1911> All of these men are dead.
[2:03:42] <%dheng1> This is dynasty warriors at this point
[2:03:43] <+oOZtkOo> once again, it seems baffling they think they can take kiryu
[2:03:48] <%tigerfang86> SUPER NOT DEAD
[2:03:52] <b_ikki> the final event songs in yakuza are always so sick
[2:03:53] <h0wiewong> I love when the bikes go flying
[2:03:53] <%Solidnick18> lol
[2:03:55] <%Solidnick18> haha
[2:03:56] <$Big_Dream> cops dont exist btw
[2:03:58] <+StrawberryPantsu> This game looks rough combat wise compared to Judgement
[2:04:01] <MoulesFritz> who the fuck thinks they can take kiryu, at this point
[2:04:06] <EMP_Ike_Turner> Kiryu invented hitting a motherfucker with another motherfucker
[2:04:09] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I mean it took him six months
[2:04:10] <+Xeno351> theoretically kiryu should be human so it's not crazy to think a human could take him
[2:04:20] <primarch_lupercal> well it was their first time using a new engine @StrawberryPantsu
[2:04:21] <%AmaniIsYourBoss> Y'know, Yakuza really is just "Hoes Mad: The Game"
[2:04:21] <InugamiTheHound> where's pocket circuit fighter? he should fight with you guys
[2:04:22] <h0wiewong> Realistically speaking their would be like 20 bodies unconscious in the street right now
[2:04:25] <%krispen_wa> Theoretically Kiryu never killed anyone but we know thats a lie
[2:04:26] <%FrostMass22> @strawberrypantsu This game looks rough compared to Kiwami 2
[2:04:27] <%shinzm1911> Fuck. I want to play this myself but I can't stop watching shit
[2:04:28] <$Big_Dream> Kiryu has super powers
[2:04:28] <xiidrifty> Good job nagumo!!!
[2:04:31] <President_valentine> @strawberrypantsu Judgment is the 3rd game using the dragon engine is why
[2:04:33] <MoulesFritz> but there's like, 30 years of evidence that kiryu is an invincible demigod
[2:04:33] <%tigerfang86> YEYEYEYE
[2:04:35] <%Solidnick18> more jobbers
[2:04:36] <Dr_Mooose> is this entire city just criminals?
[2:04:40] <+BishopBain> Most of these guys don't look like yakuza. They look like someone's dad. Kappa
[2:04:41] <MoulesFritz> who is still trying to fight him
[2:04:43] <%StuffNFluff> goin plus ultra
[2:04:44] <%Dovahthing> MOP'ED TO THE HEAD
[2:04:46] <Nina96> i like card games on motorcycles
[2:04:48] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Pepperidge Farms remembers when Kiryu shot at and blew up a rocket fired from a helicopter.
[2:04:48] <%dheng1> Rubber motorcycle
[2:04:59] <+oOZtkOo> i feel like since money canonically falls out of people they should be able to see kiryus fight aura
[2:05:01] <TheNamelessGun> @Dr_Mooose Yeah, just like Washington.
[2:05:03] <st_jimmy456> seto kaiba?
[2:05:05] <hassanico> @King_Wolf_Rigger just you wait mr. farms
[2:05:08] <tj_timbs> health
[2:05:09] <h0wiewong> Oh trust me the peak of never killed comes up real soon
[2:05:12] <InugamiTheHound> low health
[2:05:16] <hassanico> HP getting low!

[2:07:09] <%Luna_Ashford> @AngriestPat Army hospital?
[2:07:09] <@lewdskeletor13> Man I sure wish we could see more of Haruka, the character I actually care about
[2:07:11] <ahegotrigger> idk somewhere hidden since a top government official is trying to kill Kiryu
[2:07:11] <+RaziWraith> Aren't the police corrupt?
[2:07:11] <Elofhousewood> A yakuza hospital
[2:07:11] <+SpiceMustSchlemp> ALL ON THE TAKE
[2:07:16] <joedatuous> MODERN DAY!!!!?
[2:07:17] <h0wiewong> But a dude once shot the police chief in a station and he just walked out
[2:07:17] <Omegasinnocence> A school, because yakuza are stupid
[2:07:18] <Sulliman34> there was the dude in 0
[2:07:19] <MoulesFritz> @AngriestPat Serena Bar is MUCH safer
[2:07:19] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Nishitani
[2:07:20] <ahegotrigger> the fixer

[2:07:25] <%krispen_wa> MAMORU HARUKA
[2:07:26] <+Xalgar> 2 is still a LOT LUL
[2:07:27] <%tigerfang86> NO
[2:07:29] <+Flambage> @AngriestPat How often has it turned out the cop worked for the Yakuza in this game
[2:07:30] <%tigerfang86> HE'D KILL THE BABY
[2:07:34] <%tigerfang86> CAUSE HE MURDERS
[2:07:35] <%NovaKnightmare> How many times were the cops huge corrupt MONSTERS instead of good guys?
[2:07:36] <alexandrecau> @AngriestPat know how many people get fucked by the punisher when they are in police officer
[2:07:40] <NeroInfinite> A lot of the cops would just let the Yakauza in or be killed by the yakuza @AngriestPat
[2:07:41] <Dementedpenguin> Denial NotLikeThis
[2:07:42] <%SWFanatic> I saw the baby and the baby saw me
[2:07:42] <%UW_Duncan> Yakuza 0 had that one scene in jail
[2:07:44] <bigbradish> Revisionist history
[2:07:44] <+Chronobot> TAKESHI DID NOTHING wrong
[2:07:46] <%HiroTSK5> @AngriestPat That's not what I want to hear Pat, I want to hear that no one has died in Police Custody
[2:07:46] <+KoyaMusa> no he was a big hero tho, despite killing hundreds
[2:07:48] <%decent_gaming> Is Majima still around? It's probably be safe with him
[2:07:51] <+Demon_Reject> helping you is what big murderer would want
[2:07:51] <%Kirijuo> It's kamurocho like 80% of the police force is corrupt
[2:07:52] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Pat, like all Yakuza, he was secretly a good guy.
[2:07:52] <alexandrecau> he is telling you no return

[2:08:10] <@lewdskeletor13> No Majima is jail cause reasons
[2:08:11] <hassanico> @AngriestPat IIRC around this time you'd get a message from Amon if he was available
[2:08:11] <ahegotrigger> do you have any idea how many cops are fans of the punisher

[2:08:42] <theobble> man the energy drinks from the pawn shop are always the good shit
[2:08:42] <EMP_Ike_Turner> It’s the oyster shack
[2:08:43] <Sulliman34> the worst upgrades in these games are the overworld stamina
[2:08:47] <smallmiightt> I think Amon calls once you reach Kamurocho
[2:08:48] <Valentinius_Anodyne> In Kamurocho, the only thing cops do is to pat you down to find your free tissue samples
[2:08:55] <Thalchampz> B I G
[2:08:56] <Sulliman34> @spiritofmojave he cant fight bears in jail though

[2:10:33] <%doc_ock_rokc> @krispen_wa We both know Kiryu can't rap...but he would join a rap battle and then punch the rapper in the face when he insults kiryu

[2:11:16] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Banjo is adorable
[2:11:18] <stuffstuffwhatever> This game actually only needs two substories to fight amon, they do take a bit to complete admittedly, but still way faster then all of them
[2:11:19] <King_Wolf_Rigger> smash is smelly
[2:11:22] <h0wiewong> Smash players killed my parents
[2:11:23] <InugamiTheHound> blame creepy furry porn. It was so good!
[2:11:24] <@commanderclaw> We can blame famines on smash players
[2:11:28] <hassanico> @smallmiightt what does he need??
[2:11:29] <Zereaux> is judgement eyes out yet
[2:11:30] <Sulliman34> amon is an awful fight though
[2:11:31] <ExpressNode> Just retweet a picture of a bathtub, that will set them straight
[2:11:32] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> @切捨御免 the only non pushover boss in any level is Amon, if youre on normal all bosses are pushovers
[2:11:32] <stuffstuffwhatever> two specific substories

[3:30:10] <SilverFaustX> pats crying on the inside
[3:30:12] <TheShockVox> See...it’s funny how we joke about Pat having no soul....or at least MATT did. But he’s the dude who cries. He’s cried more on the channel than anyone.
[3:30:12] <%GeneralSCPatton> Stage 1 Denial?
[3:30:12] <%yoshkosh20> in seven you play robo kiryu

[3:30:13] <InugamiTheHound> like in yakuza 5
[3:30:14] <MosesUnspoken> Just let it out, Pat. BibleThump
[3:30:14] <%krispen_wa> Yakuza ending [A]
[3:30:14] <%salty_syd913> but plot gun
[3:30:14] <%spiritofmojave> That's certainyl true
[3:30:15] <bigbradish> But hes old now
[3:30:16] <$Valdorick> But not Sad Crime Drama Shot
[3:30:16] <%nobunagaesq> HE DIDN'T EVEN SEE MAJIMa!!!
[3:30:16] <ShichiNoBushi> He's an old man, though.
[3:30:16] <%korth367> he old now tho
[3:30:17] <%MagickBurritoh> but cutscene bullets
[3:30:17] <BlacSoul> When he was young
[3:30:17] <%Wallabri> but he's OLD now, bullets hurt more
[3:30:17] <Vakojin> Cyber-Kiryu
[3:30:17] <%spinalwizard> Yeah, but never that well
[3:30:18] <+zanzibar_junker> Yyyeeaahhh
[3:30:19] <eldragon_1> Denial
[3:30:20] <mr_ESB> Remember Yak 5
[3:30:20] <%Hitman0257> when will yamato 2 get its revenge
[3:30:20] <%NWR_James> these were plot bullets
[3:30:20] <Louie_Salmon> Pat don't you dare Crazy Talk Kiryu to death
[3:30:20] <%BlueMoonBlues> yeah but those were plot bullets
[3:30:20] <Marpolo13> Kiryu has enough bullets in him to load a pistol magazine
[3:30:20] <takiyami> But has he ever been shot three times in a row?
[3:30:21] <Enryuan> Denial is real
[3:30:21] <%miguelrod777> pipe to head
[3:30:21] <TheNocturnalScotsman> every game has one
[3:30:22] <%Zamorouskiwhich> Goro Majima in the credits ruuWut
[3:30:22] <sponsoredviewer910> kiryu will return in avengers 5
[3:30:22] <%AncelDeLambert> that was a STRAIGHT liver shot, tho
[3:30:23] <abakkus> kiryu "for the drama" yakuzaman
[3:30:23] <%around_40_jobbers> I'll miss Kiryu FeelsBadMan
[3:30:23] <%DXLelouch24> its not deinal chat lol
[3:30:23] <ameraaaaaa> his dead
[3:30:23] <Zombrocom> He's fine
[3:30:24] <+Demon_Reject> majima and saejima were in the game?
[3:30:25] <%FrostMass22> Did I miss Kiryu dying?
[3:30:25] <Monkeyweed21> shot more in Yakuza 5
[3:30:25] <$Garthunox> you missed the 4 library cards
[3:30:25] <+future_ry> maybe it's the bullet that broke the camel's back
[3:30:26] <+Jordevio> Is that the most beat up he's been in the series?
[3:30:26] <TranquilTurnip> Don't ty and rationalize the sad away BibleThump
[3:30:26] <+Implosivestar> it's really rough to watch a character grow through so many games then see them die <3
[3:30:27] <%Edgy_Macaroon> not at near 50 tho
[3:30:27] <+Flambage> @AngriestPat But they were cutscene bullets!
[3:30:27] <dekkitout> And he was also BEATEN with a blunt instrument prior
[3:30:28] <+zyberion626> GIVE CRAZY TALK YOUR ENERGY \o/
[3:30:28] <%Gogogolem> Is Iwami dead though?
[3:30:28] <%Nope80808> NOT WITH PLOT BULLETS
[3:30:30] <%Gufferd> he was shot way more in the end of 5
[3:30:31] <%flagi64> fuck
[3:30:31] <%Leonnald> How could you use healing potions during the fight? What if you need them for the hidden Ultima Tojo boss?!
[3:30:31] <$cureneckbeard> Kiryu survived because the bullets were deflected by previous bullets lodged in his system
[3:30:31] <Smart_ZaK1> He's fine
[3:30:32] <+hypergenn2> Or the baby starts elbowdropping babies at preschool
[3:30:32] <%shinzm1911> @AncelDeLambert No, that was above
[3:30:33] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Him in the Shin RGG Announcement isjust him passing the torch
[3:30:34] <heybenice> He’s probably okay
[3:30:34] <Nanashi_Sakamoto> But he's old already
[3:30:34] <jaytitan96> Now Kiryu becomes Robocop
[3:30:35] <laserbeaming> I'd prefer if he was dead
[3:30:35] <切捨御免> he didn't build enough resistance to bullets BibleThump
[3:30:35] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @Deano8817 Unless I'm wrong, the trailer shows the new character looking right at Kiryu.
[3:30:36] <Jack_Nightshadow> But by plot bullets?
[3:30:36] <falconx9k> Non-rubber bullets
[3:30:36] <+BigBruthaThunda> bullets are super effective against the old
[3:30:37] <%Rain_Mage> Ken Yakuza Man
[3:30:38] <lemon_lore> next game wheel chair jojo?
[3:30:38] <troxcree> Pat status: UPSET
[3:30:38] <%PopulousNix> Old man finally decides to retire
[3:30:38] <%ginger__gaming__> that was a decade ago
[3:30:39] <%AstroFalcon09> But he's older man
[3:30:40] <%shinzm1911> At worst that was a lung skim
[3:30:41] <%krispen_wa> WE have to defeat the credits sequence to save Kiryu
[3:30:41] <+TamaskaLem> It's ok, Pat. He's happy now
[3:30:41] <VritraReiRei> Stop Talking Pat NotLikeThis Don't invoke Crazy Talk NotLikeThis
[3:30:41] <%Reizie_Etherealm> This time he's just too ready to die so he accepted it and let it happen
[3:30:42] <%Alazull> Didn't he get like stabbed in the chest once?
[3:30:42] <%ginger__gaming__> He's an old man now
[3:30:42] <%shadowace2400> plot bullets
[3:30:45] <ameraaaaaa> plot bullets
[3:30:45] <%segonian> he's immune now
[3:30:45] <efratzy> hes a super old man now though
[3:30:45] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> There are medical supplies on the Mark II
[3:30:46] <TheShockVox> @superc37 Ban this man.....
[3:30:46] <%yoshkosh20> didn't he nearly freeze to death in 5?
[3:30:46] <InugamiTheHound> Big Lo
[3:30:47] <%PopulousNix> "fuck this shit I'm out"
[3:30:47] <+stevenlambchops> Lao Gui shot him like 3 times in Yakuza 0
[3:30:47] <ExpressNode> So he's basically Japanese 50 Cent?
[3:30:48] <%MagickBurritoh> Got shot in both kidneys and the leg
[3:30:49] <%spiritofmojave> Age reduced his Wolverine vitality
[3:30:50] <%miguelrod777> ALSO PIPE TO HEAD
[3:30:52] <frogurtz> He's too old Pat!
[3:30:54] <+creamandsugar> somewhere, as from a great distance and filled with sorrow, came but a single shout: "KIRYU-CHAN~!"
[3:30:56] <Enryuan> He is old now
[3:30:58] <%rumtumtugnutz> kiryu isn't old. he just gets more stronk
[3:30:58] <%shadowace2400> her's also old pat
[3:30:59] <%FrostMass22> Remember when Kiryu and that Sayama girl fucking died and then didn't because the after credits said "Takeda made a dud bomb, I guess."
[3:31:00] <+NotHereToStream> kiryu had a hard life
[3:31:00] <Warbot40> Until we see his corpse get put in a coffin filled with wet cement...I don't believe it.
[3:31:04] <gunzerkingdunce> Now turn the cross into an X!
[3:31:04] <%depressed_skeleton> apatSleep
[3:31:07] <%superc37> ?
[3:31:07] <Jetsfantasy> I'll take wheelchair Kiryu for new protag reasons
[3:31:09] <dekkitout> This was Logan for Kiryu
[3:31:09] <%Foreverduke838> @Alazull dude hes been stabbed and shot multiple times
[3:31:09] <jaytitan96> @AngriestPat But now the cold isnt here to slow the blood loss
[3:31:10] <+Implosivestar> YO SHOUT OUT TO THE FIRST SHOTS MISSING and giving time for someone to actually run over instead of them just appearing there
[3:31:10] <%Alazull> Pipe to the head from a motorcycle
[3:31:10] <abakkus> kiryu doesnt gain years he gains levels
[3:31:10] <mr_ESB> Is Kiwami 2 soon?
[3:31:11] <%NWR_James> this is a weirdly satsfying ending though.
[3:31:13] <fearhurst> @angriestpat So you're playing 50 Cent Bulletproof next right
[3:31:14] <h0wiewong> Don't forget he got shanked at the end of 3
[3:31:16] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Not even a gravestone will make me believe
[3:31:16] <%yoshkosh20> that's not his age. it's his lvl rising
[3:31:17] <Sykotix> piano
[3:31:19] <%Gogogolem> wheelchair Kiryu would be hilarious
[3:31:19] <%MonsieurHedge> shoutout to the fact that all the major yakuza characters like Majima basically didn't appear and may never appear again
[3:31:20] <MosesUnspoken> I'm gonna miss Kiryu
[3:31:21] <%superc37> he's in the trailer for 7 tho how even
[3:31:21] <%AstroFalcon09> @mr_ESB it came out a while aho
[3:31:22] <Ultimatefool> Kiryu will wise from his gwave anyway
[3:31:24] <%Reizie_Etherealm> I need to see the funeral
[3:31:25] <VanLynx> dope song tho
[3:31:29] <%MightyMaxT> Harukoma the 3rd? What happened to Harukoma Mk 2?
[3:31:31] <Zombrocom> Majima's in seven
[3:31:34] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> @superc37 It was just a fancy way of passing the torch
[3:31:35] <Monkeyweed21> HE BLEW UP IN 2
[3:31:37] <hassanico> (Puyo Puyo)
[3:31:38] <+Flambage> @AngriestPat Ya but Kiryu had a contact for Yakuza 6 so he couldn't die at the end of 5
[3:31:38] <%krispen_wa> OKADAAAA
[3:31:41] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Yeah its not canon
[3:31:42] <%blastazoid26> puyo puyo?
[3:31:43] <ameraaaaaa> so how does it feel pat
[3:31:43] <smallmiightt> Kiryu almost dies at the end of every game
[3:31:45] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> its just a pssing the torch
[3:31:45] <Cobaltor_252> this really was a song of life
[3:31:47] <gunzerkingdunce> there's a trailer for 7?
[3:31:49] <Luesagna00> @angriestpat like the length it took to not have kiryu not cannonly kill sumone
[3:31:49] <Vakojin> He's the ghost of past yakuzis in Yakuza 7
[3:31:50] <%NWR_James> Sora: SORA
[3:31:50] <Marpolo13> Majima probably would go on a fucking rampage is he found out Kiryu died
[3:31:51] <OkamiDude15> @FrostMass22 remember how they had enought time for both of them to make it out but decided just do it right there before they "died"
[3:31:52] <%Gufferd> gufferWTF See You Space Cowboy
[3:31:53] <President_valentine> Ichiban
[3:31:54] <b_ikki> SourPls
[3:31:55] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat Kiryuu comes back as a cybord in cyberpunk 2077
[3:31:55] <mr_ESB> Oh i meant
[3:31:58] <h0wiewong> And then right after Kiryu turned into Kenshiro
[3:31:58] <%Alazull> Cut to Kiryu's funeral, but then like he's in the background and gives a little smile, turns and walks away
[3:31:58] <%AstroFalcon09> @gunzerkingdunce yeah it introduces the new protag
[3:31:59] <Monkeyweed21> KIRYU BLEW UP IN 2
[3:31:59] <SomeAsianDood> F BibleThump
[3:31:59] <+Deano8817> @gunzerkingdunce a teaser trailer but yeah
[3:32:00] <dekkitout> So Force Ghost Kityu
[3:32:00] <%Idziman> JOTARO
[3:32:00] <%miguelrod777> SORA
[3:32:00] <%spiritofmojave> O7
[3:32:01] <+Demon_Reject> ichiban means #1
[3:32:02] <TheNocturnalScotsman> is that canon?
[3:32:03] <Dr_Mooose> damn good song
[3:32:04] <%Josef_Stryker> JOTARO
[3:32:05] <jaguarkek318> Anri Okita? Kreygasm
[3:32:05] <$cureneckbeard> Jotaro
[3:32:06] <+Ell1ot> he got bonked with a pipe by a guy driving a motorcycle
[3:32:07] <%miguelrod777> this song is great
[3:32:07] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> He turns into KENSHIRO in that trailer
[3:32:10] <+HellCopter> Ichiban is going to find kiryu's coat and it'll power him up
[3:32:11] <VJdarkworld> ALPHA
[3:32:12] <TheNocturnalScotsman> the trailer thing
[3:32:13] <%VanaSkiller> It could have also happened before 7
[3:32:14] <takiyami> Did you know that Ichiban literally means Number 1?
[3:32:15] <+zanzibar_junker> Good song
[3:32:16] <@lewdskeletor13> That trailer is explicitly not canon
[3:32:16] <smallmiightt> Holy shit Jotaro
[3:32:18] <%spinalwizard> It's ok, he's a lumberjack now
[3:32:20] <b_ikki> Kiryu being kenshiro is canon
[3:32:26] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> NO LUL
[3:32:28] <%krispen_wa> DAIGO IS BIG BOSS
[3:32:28] <hassanico> Yes athe start
[3:32:28] <%trillmagical> no
[3:32:28] <Hairy_butts> in the beginning
[3:32:28] <切捨御免> briefly
[3:32:28] <gunzerkingdunce> I thought Judgement was meant to be the new Yakuza
[3:32:29] <Nina96> for 10 min
[3:32:29] <%around_40_jobbers> Daigo LUL
[3:32:30] <Zombrocom> I mean, he's not dead, so it doesn't matter
[3:32:31] <h0wiewong> Nope, just the intro
[3:32:31] <Omegasinnocence> At the VERY beginning
[3:32:33] <takiyami> As much as Majima.
[3:32:33] <mr_ESB> Sup daigo
[3:32:34] <%ginger__gaming__> the opening scene
[3:32:35] <%Reizie_Etherealm> At the beginning I think
[3:32:35] <alexandrecau> wait for it
[3:32:36] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Daigo sucks as a boss
[3:32:36] <Futurecity10> Daigo died in jail.
[3:32:36] <%weissguard> For the very beginning, yeah.
[3:32:36] <Hairy_butts> and he has a bit more
[3:32:37] <%AstroFalcon09> @gunzerkingdunce no judgement is a spinoff
[3:32:37] <%Gogogolem> one scene
[3:32:37] <+Rusty_Mountain> The very beginning
[3:32:37] <%megabrogus> how similar is judgment to traditional yakuza
[3:32:38] <%spiritofmojave> Like 6 mins simialr to Majima
[3:32:38] <President_valentine> @gunzerkingdunce Spin off
[3:32:39] <jaytitan96> It was during the weird memory thing at the beginning
[3:32:40] <Zombrocom> Judgement's just a spin off
[3:32:40] <alrobot2014> @AngriestPat he was in kiryu's halucination
[3:32:41] <%ginger__gaming__> with majima
[3:32:41] <tj_timbs> Daigo was in the dream sequence at the start lmao
[3:32:41] <%NWR_James> Daigo is in the game
[3:32:41] <%MonsieurHedge> yeah the lack of old characters in 6 is the absolute WORST
[3:32:41] <ahegotrigger> Daigo was Barely in the game
[3:32:41] <%galaxyswirl> im pretty sure the trailer for 7 takes place during yakuza 5 or 4
[3:32:46] <beetbo2> Not really right? @angriestpat
[3:32:47] <ahegotrigger> but GOOD
[3:32:47] <%Zamorouskiwhich> Iwami Jobberman apatDab
[3:32:48] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> BEAT TAKESHI

[3:32:49] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> THE HERO
[3:32:50] <%krispen_wa> Beat Takeshi!
[3:32:50] <+KoyaMusa> it was BEAT TAKESHI ALL ALONG
[3:32:51] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat He was in one scene pitying the fuckers that hit Haruka.
[3:32:53] <TheNocturnalScotsman> he was in a wheelchair
[3:32:53] <jaytitan96> Beat Takeshi
[3:32:53] <%NWR_James> Beat Takeshi was really good
[3:32:55] <InugamiTheHound> they could pull a MGS4 and give use a character stinger at the end like with big boss
[3:32:55] <smallmiightt> Daigo the best character, right Pat?
[3:32:56] <mleebee> Not dead not dead not dead
[3:32:59] <gunzerkingdunce> Noted, I'll have to look that trailer up, we get a release date?

[3:46:19] <%Rain_Mage> Daigo is his true son
[3:46:19] <lloyddboy> KIRYU DONATED
[3:46:19] <Monkeyweed21> HOW
[3:46:22] <%salty_syd913> but still
[3:46:23] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Didn't he adopt her?
[3:46:23] <+NotHereToStream> haruka sawamura remember
[3:46:24] <dekkitout> Kiryu wasn't her bio-dad, that's why
[3:46:25] <+Promessa_EX> yeah that was the whole thing earlier
[3:46:26] <Marpolo13> Daigo is his son though Kappa
[3:46:27] <@commanderclaw> He's a convict, he can't adopt
[3:46:28] <%sabertoothzombie> really!?
[3:46:28] <PE4X> kiryu doesnt know what paperwork is
[3:46:28] <Sulliman34> haruka is a resident of the orphanage
[3:46:28] <eyezehuhh> Daigo...my son LUL
[3:46:28] <%rdark_ksu> PPPPSSSHHH you think Kiryu knows what sex is?
[3:46:29] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> He adopted her illegally
[3:46:29] <takiyami> That's like half the reason the plot happened
[3:46:30] <reonome> kiryu's in the US fucking that chick
[3:46:31] <alrobot2014> because he could NEVER LEGALLY ADOPT HER
[3:46:31] <Zereaux> it's getting bigger....
[3:46:31] <VanLynx> he never officially adopted haruka so "no living relatives"
[3:46:31] <Hairy_butts> he never did the paperwork
[3:46:31] <R3c0n31> Daughter in Spirit
[3:46:32] <Thesomeone96> no one cares about haruka ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper
[3:46:32] <%AnIcedCoffee> He never signed the paperwork
[3:46:32] <%king_wragles> She's his LEGALLY stolen daughter!
[3:46:32] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Oh my fucking god, fuck me then lol
[3:46:33] <%sourceofall> like the entire first half of the game wouldn't have happene if she was
[3:46:33] <切捨御免> yeah he didn't even write her a letter
[3:46:34] <%MelBrooksKA> Why don't you just go down to Osaka to check?
[3:46:34] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @arcaderabbit48 He's the son of one of the previous chairmen. I think it was the plot of 2 where they needed Daigo to step into the shoes of his father and take over, as a bratty teenager or something.
[3:46:36] <%logoth_> rubber bullets
[3:46:36] <Archmortal> @alexandrecau I know. But the total actual time spent together is non-existent compared to Haruka to the point that it being his name ruins the moment completely
[3:46:36] <Elofhousewood> Illegal daughter

[3:46:39] <ooblag> I like to think Kiryu moved to the US to be with Yakuza 2 lady
[3:46:39] <MosesUnspoken> LUL
[3:46:39] <%GarbageNirvana> Doubt they'd let him sign the paperwork

[3:57:48] <%sabertoothzombie> why is 3 bad?
[3:57:48] <%Spydurman> should I skip Yakuza Kiwami and go straight to 2?

[3:57:49] <Monkeyweed21> REMEMBER THE TWINS

[3:59:44] <ahegotrigger> or maybe its Kiryu and Goromi that I was thinking of
[3:59:44] <%Alazull> To be fair

[4:03:37] <SilverFaustX> and pretty sure ppl died in this game..
[4:03:42] <%MelBrooksKA> Rubber cargo truck
[4:03:47] <%spiritofmojave> @bread_assassin may not address the weird Illuminati shit and MARK 2, but lot would be fixed for sure
[4:03:49] <Monkeyweed21> YOU CRIED FOR LIES
[4:03:57] <dalishprince> he destroyed that knife man's skull, it was neat
[4:03:58] <Blank9> man I loved that kiryu had a soft spot for daigo
[4:03:58] <%NWR_James> That comes on like NEXT MONTH
[4:03:59] <+oOZtkOo> GIVE MY EMOTIONS BACK
[4:04:01] <%MoraMiarty> flaccid hype
[4:04:04] <fearhurst> Kiryu got paid rubber money
[4:04:04] <@lewdskeletor13> Game started strong and man did it eat shit at the end
[4:04:08] <AThing_> @NWR_James Not even man, more like 10 days
[4:04:08] <Blank9> because he clearly did and it was just stupid otherwise
[4:04:15] <ahegotrigger> you cried for Haruka and then they shoved Daigo in your face
[4:04:18] <%NWR_James> GOD REALLY!?
[4:04:19] <Dr_Mooose> sploosh
[4:04:21] <smallmiightt> Kiwami 2 after Judgement??
[4:04:27] <OkamiDude15> cant wait for us to run into kiryu in judgement Kappa
[4:04:29] <indig0bird> "Disappointment...because I wanna meet Nakamura-san"
[4:04:34] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Pat is nothing if not mildly pragmatic
[4:04:36] <%shinzm1911> shinzm1911 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! So it's been more like years but subs fucked up. Wow that ending was bad! Thanks Pat.
[4:04:37] <AThing_> @NWR_James PS4 store says Jun 21
[4:04:47] <transporterthesequel> Also that writer is doing all of Shadowbringers
[4:04:47] <Monkeyweed21> SHE WRITE SHADOWBRINGERS
[4:04:50] <%Divryne> Azim Steppe.
[4:04:56] <King_Wolf_Rigger> You thought you were getting Haruka? You fools! It was me! DAIGO!
[4:04:56] <indig0bird> Which is the best of Stormblood
[4:04:58] <indig0bird> Lol
[4:04:58] <bearwagon> i think it was all worth it to see Pat cry for Daigo, Kiryu's son
[4:04:59] <@lewdskeletor13> Can’t wait for this ending to have no meaning when they reintroduce Kiryu!
[4:05:01] <Tucker0603> she's awesome
[4:05:07] <%spiritofmojave> that recent one, hell yeah it was good
[4:05:15] <%Alazull> Azim Steppe is absolutely best part of Stormblood
[4:05:16] <indig0bird> She probably didn't choose Lyse to become importatn
[4:05:20] <%PaladinDupre> PaladinDupre subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 16 months! If you want something completely seperate then play that Fist of the North Star game. Also are you ever going back to skyrim?
[4:05:24] <GeltonZ> I'm BIG EXCITED for BUNNY BOOTY!
[4:05:28] <%spiritofmojave> boy howdy
[4:05:29] <krymzen5> i hope it's an old man Kiryu at least. like 10 years older
[4:05:32] <%Alazull> Pure anime, ends in Doma Castle, it's the shit
[4:05:33] <%Mythicalbrit> ok I didnt know that BIG HYPE
[4:05:36] <Tucker0603> big dick hyoe
[4:05:37] <smallmiightt> FOTNS is good
[4:05:41] <GundamF91> Azim Steppe, aka the only part of Stormblood anybody really talks about LOL
[4:05:54] <Monkeyweed21> DAIGO IS YOUR REAL SON
[4:05:54] <%AstroFalcon09> LUL
[4:05:56] <+ExistantPerson> Othard in general was a highlight on the expansion
[4:06:01] <%Reizie_Etherealm> I really need for there to be a theme song for shadowbringers WITH LYRICS so we can all hype in chat with words
[4:06:08] <+ExistantPerson> they put all the good stuff there aside from Shinryu and Omega
[4:06:15] <theobble> the best arc of n stormblood is the build up to tsukiyomi
[4:06:20] <dekkitout> One simply doesn't play Skyrim
[4:06:24] <worldbrand> elmo that's your cue
[4:06:26] <Monkeyweed21> KISS US
