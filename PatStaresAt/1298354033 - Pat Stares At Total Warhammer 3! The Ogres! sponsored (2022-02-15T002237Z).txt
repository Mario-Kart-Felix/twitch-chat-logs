[0:16:04] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt you can get 120 fps streaming if you delete system32 Kappa
[0:16:10] <sfah_tham> smaller pat could be bigger
[0:16:11] <brachydios777> Hey
[0:16:13] <zerointelligence000> woah!
[0:16:14] <%MooseIsGoose> where da sound

[0:16:16] <%RayReborne> no game sound of theres supposed to be
[0:16:20] <ItsMisterJason> Does that mean you lose double durability?
[0:16:23] <Ape_Law> 60PPS, Pats Per Second
[0:16:23] <%marvel877> no sound in game
[0:16:24] <%Undenizen> I have no idea what this game is but can we be ratmen?
[0:16:26] <@MistyMntns> Even more FLAILING
[0:16:26] <%SpontaneousC> but pat the human eye can only see 5 fps
[0:16:26] <nyacoo> he's too powerful
[0:16:27] <ExpressNode> Now that I think about it, how many years has he not had 60fps?
[0:16:33] <%slipdog> I Was Here
[0:16:37] <%Tearonex> @sfah_tham yeah i know, tried shortening it to beazl instead of the whole thing
[0:16:38] <%MyNameIsRasus> traded audio for more frames
[0:16:43] <%SaiyanShoto> 60fps Pat scares me
[0:16:43] <%notsoy> skaven were in warhammer 2, they are not playable in warhammer 3 yet
[0:16:49] <%Monkeyweed21> sound go down

[0:17:03] <plaguedoctor_vi> you can only fight Skaven
[0:17:07] <+ReallyBigRocks> I prefer highly offensive audio
[0:17:12] <kazadaz> There's like 3 NPC skaven factions in the WH3 map
[0:17:17] <ItsMisterJason> Pat now loses double durability
[0:17:19] <%MelBrooksKA> Is anything playable in WH3 for the average person?
[0:17:22] <+superchronicc> Nurgle all the way lets go

[0:18:32] <%MyNameIsRasus> Even Pat is at 60 FPS and Bloodborne isn't. Sadge.
[0:18:35] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt wizard lord always better

[0:21:26] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Attack and consume god
[0:21:28] <ergulor> now is golden kamui time
[0:21:29] <brachydios777> Definitly rather fight Orkz
[0:21:33] <Ape_Law> The proper reaction to any god, kill it and eat it.
[0:21:34] <+jingokrieg> I wonder if the Khorne dude freaks out at the prospect of the blood drop
[0:21:37] <+RealThiele> Eat the cocaine bear
[0:21:41] <%Jeemukun> sounds like the reptilian brain from disco
[0:21:43] <+ALazo> I can't believe that they are sold on 'You can eat it!'
[0:21:45] <%tusk102> wowie
[0:21:46] <sfah_tham> mmm girth
[0:21:47] <%SpontaneousC> ogres have it rough honestly. the whole, made perpetually hungry by some spooky eldrich mouth pit god thing isn't great
[0:21:47] <AngryAsian5> MIGHTY GIRTH
[0:21:50] <Ape_Law> girth
[0:21:52] <dundore77> cultivate mass
[0:21:52] <%Sotetsu> I want to name my kid Girth
[0:21:54] <bourgeoisdaemon> Nah Khorne is chill with the blood, they want da skull

[0:22:14] <+jingokrieg> @bourgeoisdaemon Ok but legit or meming ?
[0:22:18] <Mohawk_Sandwich> orb to orb combat. there can only be one
[0:22:19] <sendart> fuckin dorfs
[0:22:39] <ExpressNode> Ogres vs Goblins
[0:22:39] <%slipdog> that dude is getting betrayed
[0:22:46] <%JGardner03> His name is Greasus
[0:22:50] <bourgeoisdaemon> @bourgeoisdaemon No legit, I watched Legendoftotalwar's Khorne stream and Skarbrand wants the skull to redeem himself to Khorne
[0:22:56] <sfah_tham> they're made out of meat?
[0:22:58] <+KingpinLarry> God meat aye?
[0:22:59] <brachydios777> So why would Slannesh want the God Bear?
[0:23:00] <zerointelligence000> I love how book dude knows how to get favor with every faction
[0:23:05] <Zebroneath> *Consume*
[0:23:10] <Finchit> ogres are quite fitting for pat tbh
[0:23:13] <+jingokrieg> @bourgeoisdaemon OH THATS SICK WTF
[0:23:13] <%notsoy> ogre camp = settlement that can be dropped anywhere
[0:23:18] <dundore77> camps are basically settlements you can place and remove on the map
[0:23:22] <jimjamstrawberryslamalam> nom nom time
[0:23:23] <%Monkeyweed21> Major settlements are put anywhere you want
[0:23:25] <%Sotetsu> meowriiiBread
[0:23:41] <bourgeoisdaemon> What did you change Pat to make it not chug?
[0:23:48] <%Sotetsu> You're a noblar
[0:23:50] <+RealThiele> new driver
[0:24:04] <kazadog> chaffiest of chaff
[0:24:06] <zerointelligence000> Arch ruined the word gnoblar for me
[0:24:09] <AmusingMantis> "THE Shockingly Obese" now thats a title to inspire fear
[0:24:10] <cgreene64> @bourgeoisdaemon new drivers
[0:24:11] <TrollKing96> How powerful is Ursun compared to the Chaos Gods?
[0:24:14] <+ryderbootz> gnoblars fucking suck, love those nasty little freaks
[0:24:14] <kazadaz> Brain Gnoblins
[0:24:16] <%tusk102> the reaAH
[0:24:26] <sfah_tham> well he's dying for one
[0:24:31] <%Valdorick> Stonehorn BIG CHONKERS
[0:24:31] <bourgeoisdaemon> STONEHORN STRONG
[0:24:32] <%VioletHeart> Stonehorns are hype.
[0:24:32] <%Felhad> Stonehorns fuckin rule
[0:24:35] <%Felhad> yup
[0:24:38] <+jingokrieg> @TrollKing96 Depends on how many people in Kislev pray to it I think
[0:24:47] <%Valdorick> Your ultimate monster
[0:24:50] <plaguedoctor_vi> expendable is just that if they died they don´t do damage to leadership to the rest of the army
[0:24:51] <%chance_h> are there waifu's in this game/
[0:24:51] <%Felhad> Theyre huge
[0:24:51] <%VioletHeart> BIG WEAPON
[0:24:55] <%notsoy> it's one big monster, not a squad
[0:24:56] <+lordericter> yeah monsters
[0:24:59] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt STONEHORNS FUCK
[0:25:00] <+ReallyBigRocks> big number
[0:25:01] <$SGrim> KILL
[0:25:02] <%Monkeyweed21> BIG BOI
[0:25:05] <mrtanaka111> @chance_h greasus
[0:25:06] <dundore77> ogres are big damage big charge guys.
[0:25:06] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt single target WS is always huge, that's not too big
[0:25:08] <IntellectualFunk> they're huge and their bones are made of rock
[0:25:10] <kazadaz> If you mouseover the little stick-figure under the HP bar, you can see the unit's mass
[0:25:24] <+Solutha> you usually start with 1 highest tier unit
[0:25:25] <%Felhad> Ironguts are mobile artillery
[0:25:32] <%Valdorick> Wait, unit mass is given to us now? 10/10
[0:25:33] <%Sotetsu> Hey girl, nice stats! You kiss your mother with those stats?
[0:25:42] <bourgeoisdaemon> The most important thing about Ogres is to be constantly charging
[0:25:44] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt the stonehorns do a lot of damage but it's one monster instead of a squad, can only target one enemy
[0:25:44] <+froduck42> bread and butter
[0:25:45] <Visorak6> anti-tarpit?
[0:25:45] <plaguedoctor_vi> Flank unit
[0:25:45] <%LeiaSkynoober> @chance_h A couple, there's the Tsarina of Kislev and the Storm Dragon lady of Grand Cathay. There's other female lords in Warhammer 2 too
[0:25:51] <%legendfather_of_giants> standard infantry
[0:25:56] <+Buttlo> jorbsArrive
[0:26:03] <bourgeoisdaemon> Compare mass to gnoblars!
[0:26:07] <sfah_tham> Kgs
[0:26:09] <+lordericter> mass is resistance to knockback
[0:26:09] <sfah_tham> or lbs
[0:26:12] <+RealThiele> Mass: Yes
[0:26:14] <dundore77> mass is how hard they push in/resist pushes to charges.
[0:26:16] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt mass is how easily they push other units aside
[0:26:18] <%notsoy> more mass = better charges, easier to push out of moshpits
[0:26:20] <+lordericter> and also how well it can push through
[0:26:20] <kazadaz> More mass= more charge damage (and charge resistance)
[0:26:29] <plaguedoctor_vi> Anti infary
[0:26:31] <%Monkeyweed21> dual weapons are anti infantry
[0:26:37] <+froduck42> anti infantry bonus
[0:26:40] <brachydios777> I think the chaos gods here are not the exact same entities as in 40k, right?
[0:26:41] <HR_Freud> I don't get it
[0:26:46] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt mass is how strong their charge distance and resistance to knockback is. so you want charge monsters to be heavy as hell
[0:26:50] <%Bluwizard21> why cant i play this now?
[0:26:53] <%tusk102> charge damage*
[0:26:55] <%Valdorick> @chance_h And of course, anything is a waifu, if you praise Slaanesh
[0:27:14] <brachydios777> *Alternate universe versions I mean
[0:27:16] <%fat_burtreynolds> Magic or some shire
[0:27:23] <%Valdorick> Building limit fo 4? Huh.
[0:27:37] <dundore77> ogres only have 4 space settlements camps are 10 place settlements you can place onto the map
[0:27:41] <%Monkeyweed21> Ogre capitals are their camps
[0:27:49] <klx5> oh like the skaven food
[0:27:53] <brachydios777> HUGE QUEST
[0:27:53] <+lordericter> careful with your meat
[0:27:54] <%tusk102> but limited by how much meat you habe
[0:28:13] <%VioletHeart> Ogres fight better on a full stomach.
[0:28:15] <+superchronicc> yes you do dont lie
[0:28:19] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt stonehorns are strong but they are single target big monsters
[0:28:21] <%Valdorick> Make them Meat, Meat postive
[0:28:31] <+jingokrieg> Are Rats confirmed for 3 ?
[0:28:32] <IntellectualFunk> fun ogre lore fact: their stomachs are magically blessed and can digest even demons and metal
[0:28:50] <%Valdorick> A staunch line of Gnob
[0:28:56] <%Felhad> the trappers throw bear traps
[0:28:56] <brachydios777> Would an Ork taste like meat or a mushroom?
[0:28:59] <derap41> that's longer than you can throwq
[0:29:02] <+froduck42> ambush skirmishers
[0:29:05] <bourgeoisdaemon> lmao gnoblars are such garbage
[0:29:06] <+lordericter> thrown weapons tend to cap out rangewise at like 80
[0:29:06] <+ryderbootz> yeah literally just eat them they aint shit
[0:29:10] <bourgeoisdaemon> Yep!
[0:29:10] <sfah_tham> meatshroom
[0:29:17] <%VioletHeart> They're ogres, you never have a lot. It's an army of single but beefy units.
[0:29:19] <AmusingMantis> GUTS OUT
[0:29:47] <plaguedoctor_vi> the Gnoblars with range can Stalk and they have vanguard, with stalk they are invisible and with vanguard you can put them near the enemy. they are more for ambush
[0:29:55] <%Monkeyweed21> turn on unit cards
[0:29:56] <kazadaz> This party's ogre
[0:30:04] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt ogre fact: they have magic stomach and can eat pretty much anything, even demons and metal. the ultimate vorbs
[0:30:07] <+jingokrieg> RAD
[0:30:08] <+bunchaghosts> cool
[0:30:11] <%Felhad> Stonehorns are the fuckin coolest
[0:30:12] <zerointelligence000> they're pretty rad
[0:30:14] <bourgeoisdaemon> The stonehorn could solo this battle lol
[0:30:15] <darkodargon> thank you pat
[0:30:17] <dundore77> The gnoblar trappers have a special ammo the first charge at them gives like 40% charge debuff they are meant to take a charge and then you charge your own ogres
[0:30:18] <%Felhad> yes
[0:30:19] <brachydios777> Now that is a battle beast
[0:30:21] <+lordericter> Pat you have managed to play both of the legendary lords in TWW3 with mobility scooters between this and Nurgle
[0:30:21] <%legendfather_of_giants> yep
[0:30:22] <%Valdorick> It is
[0:30:24] <AmusingMantis> Yes
[0:30:25] <plaguedoctor_vi> yes gut magic
[0:30:26] <%VioletHeart> That stone "plating" is actually its skull. Stonehorns are so angry that they headbutt everything and scrape the skin off their face.
[0:30:28] <%tusk102> yep
[0:30:32] <%Valdorick> Fire Guts can eat metal and spit slag
[0:30:34] <+yungkame> this looks so cool i wish i knew how to play RTS's lol
[0:30:38] <AmusingMantis> THEY HUNGY
[0:30:38] <%Monkeyweed21> they cast magic by eating stuff
[0:30:41] <deviljhojho_> its all muscle baby
[0:30:41] <zerointelligence000> big fat steps
[0:30:45] <derap41> Magic Cursed same thing really
[0:30:46] <%Monkeyweed21> BIG LEGS
[0:30:47] <plaguedoctor_vi> from the great maw in their lands
[0:30:48] <+BeatH7> @PatStaresAt  just use the stonehorn to kill all of them it's just 3 units
[0:30:49] <brachydios777> Oh lawd they coming
[0:30:51] <bourgeoisdaemon> Yep! You're fast and you have super high charge bonus, so constantly move and charge
[0:30:53] <%Bloomingzonda> Paige also has a magic stomach. It can digest infinite mcdonalds
[0:30:53] <%thbluewarden> gotta get that meat
[0:30:56] <%fat_burtreynolds> Aww this looks pretty good
[0:30:57] <hakumaribo> whoa,
[0:30:58] <%Valdorick> pat, you know they're fast, they outran your entire Nurgle Army last week LUL
[0:31:01] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt being tall=long legs
[0:31:01] <hakumaribo> spin the camera again
[0:31:05] <kazadog> @yungkame the tutorial in 3 is quite robust in 3 from all accounts maybe give it a shot if youre interested
[0:31:07] <%MooseIsGoose> send them in
[0:31:13] <hakumaribo> there was zero lag when you did that
[0:31:19] <%TheAdMerlin> Nurglites are all slow
[0:31:23] <Lagzlot> Mcdonalds is like the anti-food. Somehow eating it makes you hungrier.
[0:31:25] <derap41> Listen to them boys rpar
[0:31:56] <%tusk102> STONEHORNS ARE SICK
[0:31:58] <bourgeoisdaemon> STONEHORN OP
[0:32:00] <%Felhad> Ogres are the best
[0:32:00] <%VioletHeart> Stonehorns baybeeee
[0:32:02] <%Valdorick> Daw, look at that happy little Rock Dog
[0:32:02] <+lordericter> inflicts terror, amirigh
[0:32:06] <hakumaribo> wow that thing gave no fucks
[0:32:09] <bearablepuns> morale 100 to 0 lol
[0:32:16] <Manwad> they're havin' one
[0:32:18] <derap41> lot of meat being smacked
[0:32:21] <+p4ntless> THEIR GUTS ARE UNIMPRESSIVE, THEIR TITTIES MEDIOCRE
[0:32:34] <zerointelligence000> that's pretty decisive
[0:32:35] <Lagzlot> 'gief with horns.
[0:32:41] <%legendfather_of_giants> pyrrhic
[0:32:44] <+OG_M_Bison> Hey chat how's Pat doin so far?
[0:32:45] <kazadaz> 2/10 would not eat
[0:32:51] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt and you didnt even eat meat
[0:32:51] <%Valdorick> You only lost 13 gnoblars
[0:32:52] <MidnightPacif1c> MEDIOCRE
[0:32:53] <+ryderbootz> now's comes da fun part
[0:32:58] <darkodargon> 27 kills in like 6 seconds
[0:33:01] <%notsoy> we just did the first battle lol
[0:33:01] <%Bailey__Gaming> It's All Ogre now
[0:33:02] <derap41> That was all Gnobblars
[0:33:03] <%VioletHeart> Now time to eat those dead ogres. And your dead ogres. And the gnoblars. And the trees.
[0:33:03] <%TheAdMerlin> I think your loses were freindly fire too
[0:33:03] <dundore77> The gnoblar trappers have a special ammo the first charge at them gives like 40% charge debuff they are meant to take a charge and then you charge your own ogres
[0:33:04] <sfah_tham> This is the power of a solid economy
[0:33:04] <bourgeoisdaemon> I wish you could rename units, name that Stonehorn Zangief
[0:33:07] <brachydios777> They’re huge, that means they have huge guts!
[0:33:17] <%Valdorick> By the way Pat, if you don't auto resolve, send your cav/fast bois to chase down fleeing units after battle at x3 speed.
[0:33:24] <+OG_M_Bison> Oh he just started
[0:33:27] <+jingokrieg> Nom
[0:33:32] <%Felhad> eat dat meat
[0:33:32] <jimjamstrawberryslamalam> meat
[0:33:33] <%Monkeyweed21> VORB IT UP
[0:33:37] <%MidnightBurst12> food is good
[0:33:44] <+lordericter> do you think it hurts meat man to give us his meat?
[0:33:52] <zerointelligence000> yeyeye
[0:33:52] <AnnoyedApricot> LuL
[0:33:56] <%NitronStreams> Shocking
[0:33:57] <kazadog> yeah but what about in game?
[0:33:57] <%Valdorick> Its not that Shocking.
[0:33:58] <%Bailey__Gaming> GREASUS
[0:34:00] <Zudrag> LUL
[0:34:02] <Dr_Mooose> shocking
[0:34:11] <%Valdorick> He just... fucking CHUCKS spears
[0:34:15] <ergulor> a club
[0:34:16] <derap41> What is his trait?
[0:34:22] <%Felhad> @patstaresat When ogres duel the winner eats part of or all of the loser.
[0:34:22] <%fat_burtreynolds> Sounds good to me
[0:34:25] <%MyNameIsRasus> i read gutsy as gussy. i'm too far gone
[0:34:39] <+jingokrieg> Yeets sharpened trees
[0:34:54] <bourgeoisdaemon> increase mobility is the best skill, rank it whenever possible
[0:35:01] <%notsoy> yeah, anybody who gets a hero that boosts movement should put one in every army if possible
[0:35:02] <+OG_M_Bison> He gets a pimp cart PogChamp
[0:35:03] <mrtanaka111> wall mart buyer
[0:35:03] <BliVru> @patstaresat you can shut up the Advisor in options menu
[0:35:04] <kazadaz> Army mobility is life
[0:35:04] <derap41> That's pretty shocking
[0:35:07] <%VioletHeart> Top right.
[0:35:08] <Yomamma1337> under big names
[0:35:10] <dundore77> the big name tab
[0:35:11] <sfah_tham> sweet tricycle
[0:35:11] <Play_UN_Squadron> big names tab?
[0:35:12] <bearablepuns> What is that leg of meat from monkaS
[0:35:15] <%TheAdMerlin> Up there besides skills
[0:35:17] <%Bailey__Gaming> THE DUKE FROM VILLAGE?
[0:35:20] <+DrTribal> my favorite robot in fallout is Mr. Gussy
[0:35:25] <%tusk102> LMAO
[0:35:27] <KaiserMario> wow, it's like I'm seeing double
[0:35:33] <MidnightPacif1c> psaGiefstare_TK hmmmm
[0:35:35] <dundore77> 1 every 10 turns
[0:35:40] <kazadog> BIG FAT
[0:35:43] <%KineticZen> psaBig
[0:35:46] <zerointelligence000> be so obese it's shocking
[0:35:49] <derap41> Who needs leadership when you're winning
[0:35:51] <+OG_M_Bison> Shockingly obese is bad I feel like cause you'll get hit by more arrows right?
[0:35:53] <brachydios777> So are there Orgre females? Cause how do they repopulate?
[0:36:00] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt unit mass makes every unit that does charge damage stronger
[0:36:12] <%tusk102> and resistant to knockback
[0:36:17] <%Bailey__Gaming> Are we the Fat Evil?
[0:36:26] <%Felhad> @brachydios777 there are, they just dont usually fight in wars/raids
[0:36:29] <%notsoy> the aura size booster sucks, don't ever bother for any race
[0:36:32] <kazadog> @OG_M_Bison units mass has no effect on missile accuracy afaik just affects charge knockback and impact
[0:36:33] <kazadaz> His unique tree opens up at level 2???
[0:36:40] <+OG_M_Bison> Hans... are we the fatties?
[0:36:48] <brachydios777> @felhad Thanks
[0:36:51] <bourgeoisdaemon> Ogres in general are basically hybrid infantry/shock cavalry
[0:36:52] <derap41> @brachydios777 They've got a cute ritual where the male ogre feeds her. in ogre society it considered the biggest courtesy
[0:36:54] <dundore77> @Bailey__Gaming we are the fat neutral. Ogres just want food and will fight for anyone
[0:37:16] <+OG_M_Bison> @kazadaz It doesn't affect acuracy but if you're a bigger target you're way easier to hit. Like mammoths would get wrecked by a line of handgunners for example in 2
[0:37:31] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt ogres are mostly shock trooper/cavalry type units
[0:37:33] <brachydios777> @derap41 Surprisingly wholesome
[0:37:34] <derap41> You want more trach?
[0:37:37] <AmusingMantis> the answer is always more gnoblars
[0:37:37] <+jingokrieg> BIG
[0:37:41] <%tusk102> hence the mass and charge bonus things
[0:37:42] <kazadog> @OG_M_Bison it doesnt actually make his model bigger though
[0:37:42] <dundore77> gnoblar trappers would be better more ogres right now
[0:37:44] <%legendfather_of_giants> @OG_M_Bison that's model size, not mass
[0:37:45] <+jingokrieg> OGRES
[0:37:45] <%Monkeyweed21> bolth
[0:37:47] <%notsoy> MORE ORB
[0:37:54] <%Bailey__Gaming> @dundore77 I have no strong feelings one way or the other about this?
[0:37:59] <+OG_M_Bison> Oh I see
[0:38:03] <+OG_M_Bison> I was just confused I guess
[0:38:05] <%Chex868> gnoblar trappers are legit
[0:38:05] <kazadaz> It's ogre 9000!!
[0:38:08] <derap41> @brachydios777 Ogre willing to give food to someone else Now that's romance
[0:38:09] <%notsoy> btw you have unused movement range, move first before recruiting
[0:38:12] <ExpressNode> Orbgres
[0:38:19] <%Felhad> @patstaresat the Gnoblars are basically there to bog down enemies so your ogres and monsters can wreck them from the flank
[0:38:19] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[0:38:40] <%chance_h> you need to pay $5.99 for each additional fps sir
[0:38:40] <+total_overkill> 29? really? wtf
[0:38:51] <%strakillias> Did they lock the campaign map to 30 fps by accident?
[0:39:06] <brachydios777> I wonder how the Green Boiz feel about fighting these guys
[0:39:10] <Gelphaze> Time to eat some humes.
[0:39:21] <%tusk102> that feels very on purpose to avoid the game breaking
[0:39:25] <%Felhad> The Total Warhammers are notoriously hard on GPUs/CPUs
[0:39:31] <+jingokrieg> Gut Magic
[0:39:48] <$bootysteve> Surplus Meat is what they called me in high school
[0:39:52] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt Thats the stomach magic
[0:39:55] <%Bailey__Gaming> DAMAGED GO UP
[0:39:55] <+DrTribal> man imma have to play this game when it comes out. I really wanted to like the second one
[0:40:02] <%chance_h> 4X games tend to have god awful optimization even though they're basically spreadsheet simulators half the time
[0:40:09] <derap41> That turn timer is orgasmic
[0:40:24] <%watts121> Pat quit Nurgle and went Ogres?
[0:40:28] <+jingokrieg> I wish i could play this, 2 sets my rig alight
[0:40:41] <+jingokrieg> @watts121 Just showing them of
[0:40:48] <@Ranryu692> I don't think this game knows what a pyrrhic victory is
[0:40:50] <kazadaz> Nurgle is... not suitable for a new player
[0:40:58] <arkv01> meet n fuk
[0:40:59] <Gelphaze> Meat up good!
[0:41:00] <+lordericter> just speed and charge bonuses via mass seems like a waste
[0:41:04] <CatRidder> give meat to the gieff
[0:41:20] <sheeperson34> Greasus is the ugliest mother fucker
[0:41:20] <+jingokrieg> Meat up is like Bird up but with cold cuts
[0:41:22] <+lordericter> seems better to shove the meat into the maw pit
[0:41:24] <%legendfather_of_giants> I mean this game does a good approximation of a pyrrhic victory
[0:41:25] <AmusingMantis> :) haha get it meat
[0:41:29] <%SaiyanShoto> This is a meat moment
[0:41:30] <kazadaz> Man I'm really ogre this framerate!!
[0:41:32] <brachydios777> It would be so awesome for 40k dawn of war 4 to be like this
[0:41:36] <%Felhad> that is correct
[0:41:37] <dundore77> yes and some gnoblars
[0:41:37] <mrtanaka111> shock infantry
[0:41:40] <kazadog> @lordericter prob just nice bonuses once youre economy gets rolling and you have more meat than you know what to do with
[0:41:41] <%notsoy> all of the actual good things in this race are big guys yeah
[0:41:43] <%legendfather_of_giants> "montrous infantry" is the unit class @PatStaresAt
[0:41:48] <kazadaz> They've got cannoneers too
[0:41:49] <bourgeoisdaemon> Always Be Charging! Secret to Ogre success!
[0:41:51] <derap41> They're all shock cavalry
[0:41:53] <%OG_M_Bison> OG_M_Bison subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! This sub is for GORK WAAAAAAAGH! SMOrc
[0:41:58] <CloudCircus> Hi Pat!
[0:42:01] <%BinaryFireball> they big
[0:42:04] <%notsoy> you can basically consider them cavalry
[0:42:05] <%BinaryFireball> and monsterous
[0:42:05] <zenith0111> Prepare for long grueling battle
[0:42:14] <%legendfather_of_giants> stuff like 20 huge guys instead of 80 normal guys is monstrous infantry
[0:42:14] <%Monkeyweed21> big damage but easy to hit
[0:42:15] <%notsoy> harpoons!
[0:42:16] <%Felhad> Throws harpoons
[0:42:16] <dundore77> throws his spear
[0:42:18] <kazadog> he throw the spear
[0:42:22] <+rafaelba93> strong ranged unit
[0:42:24] <%thbluewarden> he got harpoon
[0:42:26] <Gelphaze> Cool!
[0:42:39] <+p4ntless> monstrous infantry are usually hammers instead of anvils
[0:42:42] <bourgeoisdaemon> Monstrous infantry are more vulnerable to ranged, but because they lose fewer entities they keep their melee dps longer than high number infantry like Gnobs
[0:42:46] <derap41> He's got a pointy stick that he throws
[0:42:52] <Zombrocom> Monstrous infantry is a bit of an odd archtype, but long story short you generally want to pair them up with your gnoblars for best use
[0:43:03] <dundore77> @PatStaresAt the trappers would be better at the front actually. they're range but they give charge debuffs first time they attack with the range
[0:43:06] <%legendfather_of_giants> (also monstrous infantry is historically bad because of WH2's range meta)
[0:43:13] <Ape_Law> i smell gabe
[0:43:27] <Zombrocom> They have a lot of mass, and can easily roadblock up enemies, but are vulnerable to getting surrounded
[0:43:28] <derap41> Yeah they throws traps
[0:43:33] <huskarl_zap> they throw nets
[0:43:34] <%notsoy> check the icons at the bottom of the unit card
[0:43:34] <ilasper1> are sieges less lame now
[0:43:34] <derap41> cause they're trappers
[0:43:37] <bourgeoisdaemon> See buffs at bottom of unit card
[0:43:37] <dundore77> its like 40%
[0:43:37] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt they make the enemy's inital impact hurt less
[0:43:39] <%Felhad> they set up bear traps @patstaresat
[0:43:40] <%notsoy> you can see any special abilities there
[0:43:43] <Gelphaze> Good to know.
[0:43:44] <kazadaz> Check out the abilities at the bottom maybe
[0:43:49] <%Monkeyweed21> look at abilites
[0:43:53] <dundore77> thats their point
[0:43:53] <%Felhad> yes
[0:43:53] <derap41> who cares
[0:43:54] <%legendfather_of_giants> move them back after they throw
[0:43:55] <%Pappajimbo> expendable
[0:43:56] <Finchit> they're expenable
[0:43:57] <%Chex868> who cares thats there job
[0:43:57] <%notsoy> yes, but that's what they exist for
[0:43:58] <%Felhad> they will get rekt
[0:43:59] <bourgeoisdaemon> The ogres are fast and will charge right over them
[0:44:00] <%thbluewarden> they're expendable
[0:44:01] <%hairtoday> yeah but gnoblars
[0:44:01] <kazadog> eh normal difficulty any unit is viable, its mostly the ai cheats on harder difficulties that make melee suck
[0:44:02] <Gray_LoFi> Yeah but they're gnoblars
[0:44:03] <Zombrocom> Yeah, they trap enemies that charge them. They are your roadblock, them you charge the ogres in
[0:44:06] <kazadaz> Sometimes men must die
[0:44:07] <CatRidder> they are expendable
[0:44:07] <%Monkeyweed21> who cares its gnoblars
[0:44:10] <%TheAdMerlin> Gnoblar's exist to be chewed up
[0:44:11] <%fat_burtreynolds> Meatshielding boys
[0:44:11] <plaguedoctor_vi> anything large has a more change to get hit by range
[0:44:14] <%Jeemukun> they're gnoblers, they're supposed to die
[0:44:15] <+Solutha> they shoot, then can retreat back
[0:44:15] <%Treuan> They will get wrecked and then you'll buy more, there's always more
[0:44:17] <%Felhad> Gnoblars are there to die
[0:44:17] <brachydios777> Shooting our own guys, we Skaven now?
[0:44:19] <bearablepuns> That's their lot seqY
[0:44:19] <Zombrocom> Trap em with the gobbos, then charge the ogres in
[0:44:26] <%TheAdMerlin> They're waht's called "tarpit" units
[0:44:28] <%Jeemukun> Tthey're literally expendable
[0:44:32] <bourgeoisdaemon> @brachydios777 Nah we eatin our own guys
[0:44:35] <%legendfather_of_giants> expendable units exist to hold stuff in place for your big guys to smash @PatStaresAt
[0:44:39] <ilasper1> born to die FeelsBadMan
[0:44:48] <derap41> Gnoblars trap em Ogres charge em
[0:44:55] <Gelphaze> Canon Fodder I guess.
[0:45:03] <%Pappajimbo> gnoblars are the creatures goblins bully they are that shit
[0:45:12] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt they're expendable, use them to stop the enemy so your ogres can beat the shit out of the enemy
[0:45:14] <Fist_Wizard_Jay> here come the fat
[0:45:24] <%notsoy> you can double-tap a group button to pan your camera over to the guy
[0:45:29] <derap41> They're anti large?
[0:45:36] <bourgeoisdaemon> Ogres have so much mass that antilarge infantry can't handle it
[0:45:36] <%Monkeyweed21> they arent anti large
[0:45:38] <kazadog> anti large only gets you so far
[0:45:39] <Zombrocom> I mean, they are only so anti large
[0:45:44] <%legendfather_of_giants> not all spears are anti-large Pat
[0:45:45] <%notsoy> i don't think gnoblars are anti large no
[0:45:58] <+Solutha> Cuz its a starter expendable unit versus the highest tier monster
[0:46:01] <kazadaz> They were gnoblar spears guys
[0:46:02] <BedHome> ogres feel very pat. giant egg men
[0:46:04] <sheeperson34> 'ere they go
[0:46:05] <%Felhad> Gnoblars arent anti anything
[0:46:07] <%Valdorick> That's fairly common. +10 to attack and damage sometimes doesn't over come 100% more hp and massive AoE attacks.
[0:46:07] <Fist_Wizard_Jay> anti large like a toddler with a toothpick
[0:46:09] <dundore77> theres different levels of anti-large they do extra to large monsters but its still small
[0:46:11] <huskarl_zap> gnoblar ain't gonna do shit to the stonehorn
[0:46:12] <+Glock3bb> You can hold alt to click and drag units in formation.
[0:46:13] <kazadog> hes prob just assuming bacuase they have the spears icon
[0:46:20] <Zombrocom> Good luck gnobbos
[0:46:21] <bourgeoisdaemon> @notsoy Yeah they are, everything is larger than them
[0:46:29] <Fist_Wizard_Jay> The Great Orb hungers!
[0:46:31] <derap41> @kazadaz Those spears are 2 foot long
[0:46:36] <+ReallyBigRocks> yeah gettem
[0:46:38] <Zombrocom> I guess he wanted to go sideways?
[0:46:40] <Yomamma1337> cant charge super well against spears
[0:46:40] <+ALazo> he needed a do over
[0:46:43] <BedHome> THERES ya drama
[0:46:59] <kazadaz> I think we've got an audio desync
[0:47:00] <+yungkame> oh my god hes just ragdolling them
[0:47:02] <%legendfather_of_giants> @Yomamma1337 gnoblars aren't anti-large
[0:47:02] <Gelphaze> YEAH BABY! maw am down!
[0:47:02] <%MyNameIsRasus> man fantasy wars are so cool
[0:47:24] <+ReefTheWizard> gotta get in there
[0:47:25] <Yomamma1337> @Yomamma1337 i never said they were, I said that they had spears
[0:47:33] <bourgeoisdaemon> Greasus has got this
[0:48:03] <derap41> Giant sweaty pit of fat
[0:48:10] <derap41> and muscle
[0:48:37] <bourgeoisdaemon> GLITCH!
[0:48:45] <%tusk102> woooooo
[0:48:48] <dundore77> theres probably an ogre stuck in that blob
[0:48:48] <%fat_burtreynolds> I’ll take the Greasus bucket meal please
[0:48:51] <kazadog> yay pathfinding bugs
[0:48:51] <+lordericter> the unit pathing says you are not in control
[0:48:54] <bourgeoisdaemon> Take a drink everypony
[0:48:55] <%fat_burtreynolds> Extra hooman
[0:49:17] <+RealThiele> auto resolve lookin more and more tempting with all the pathfinding bugs
[0:49:20] <derap41> @bourgeoisdaemon If we do that we're all gonna be dead by the end of the stream
[0:49:23] <dundore77> ogres will get stuck together cause they're big and cant seperate from the unit. your guys were ganging up on the one left behind most likely
[0:49:37] <%Valdorick> He's ranged
[0:49:38] <derap41> Cause je jas guard and is ranged
[0:49:42] <huskarl_zap> he throws at max range
[0:49:44] <%Monkeyweed21> hes ranged
[0:49:45] <Finchit> guard mode makes it so they dont chase after units
[0:49:50] <bourgeoisdaemon> unlock control groups to improve pathfinding in tight areas
[0:49:54] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt ogres are so big they sometimes get stuck together. also hes a ranged unit
[0:50:06] <derap41> Turn it off in the settings menu
[0:50:10] <huskarl_zap> left alt double right click to make ranged attack in close combat
[0:50:14] <derap41> Guard isn't good for melee heavy armies
[0:50:15] <+ReefTheWizard> @tusk102 they love eachother
[0:50:17] <BliVru> You took it off last stream
[0:50:21] <dundore77> hes range you have to Alt click to melee attack
[0:50:22] <+StromkoPenguin> The game assumes you want Guard on by default, even though with some armies you definitely don't.
[0:50:27] <bourgeoisdaemon> Unlock the control group, they're trying to hold a formation
[0:50:27] <+terrorengine> So, Ogre first impressions?
[0:50:29] <plaguedoctor_vi> the Shield means they are bracing for any charge
[0:50:35] <BliVru> They are IN CONTROL GROUP
[0:50:42] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt the control group are trying to hold formation
[0:50:43] <huskarl_zap> your iron guts are losing
[0:50:51] <darkodargon> oh no the towers
[0:50:58] <bourgeoisdaemon> WALL!
[0:51:05] <derap41> And they said this would be a phyric victory
[0:51:09] <%notsoy> in tight quarters like settlement fights, i wouldn't lock formations at all
[0:51:11] <%FutaSnek> @PatStaresAt What faction ya playing as currently?
[0:51:13] <+ReallyBigRocks> :)
[0:51:20] <Octopimp> oh boy, ogres
[0:51:30] <%legendfather_of_giants> formation bad
[0:51:35] <%Monkeyweed21> pat still ignoring towers huh
[0:51:36] <+lordericter> your lord seems to be eating shit
[0:51:38] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt you have to unlock your control group, they're stuck in formation and thats why they're acting weird
[0:51:57] <derap41> You lost it at the end but its ok
[0:51:57] <Finchit> move your lord out of the fight brah
[0:52:00] <+GemeSvev> As someone who knows nothing about Warhammer, I thought you were making things up when you said Gnoblars on twitter
[0:52:02] <%FutaSnek> Welcome to RTS LUL
[0:52:04] <+RealThiele> hi octo
[0:52:10] <Ogresalad> hey guys if i wanna start playing total warhammer what game should i start with
[0:52:11] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt you ignored the towers again and let them shoot up your army
[0:52:17] <%FutaSnek> I feel like I could have done better defines the genre
[0:52:18] <huskarl_zap> should play  in not fast forward
[0:52:22] <+scarman125> why is he still on fast forward LUL
[0:52:29] <Admiral_PopnFresh> octoLurk
[0:52:32] <bourgeoisdaemon> @Ogresalad 3, this one, it has the best tutorial
[0:52:34] <Gelphaze> Stick fight yea!
[0:52:36] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt towers do lots of damage
[0:52:39] <kazadaz> IMO you gotta do more move orders and less attack orders, positioning is importrant
[0:52:49] <%FutaSnek> ayyyy
[0:52:58] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt the towers beat the shit out of your units cuz you ignore them, and you never unlocked your control group so they were stuck in formation
[0:52:58] <CatRidder> you lost so mant units
[0:53:01] <+lordericter> a hollow victory in the end
[0:53:02] <%FutaSnek> @PatStaresAt Wat faction?
[0:53:03] <%OG_M_Bison> Pyrhic psaWhat
[0:53:03] <darkodargon> eat em
[0:53:07] <brachydios777> “Ate umi, ate chaos, ate orc. Luv me tyrant, luv me gut, luv maw, simple as”
[0:53:09] <bourgeoisdaemon> A win is a win
[0:53:15] <%legendfather_of_giants> @FutaSnek ogres
[0:53:19] <darkodargon> @FutaSnek ogres
[0:53:22] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt you cant ignore towers, especially with big bois
[0:53:23] <Dr_Mooose> its fiiiiine
[0:53:26] <%FutaSnek> thx
[0:53:33] <%legendfather_of_giants> can you even recruit another bull right now?
[0:53:38] <Gelphaze> Who's worried, not pat.
[0:53:44] <+ReefTheWizard> those were people's sons pat, husbands, fathers
[0:53:47] <kazadaz> Gief Needs Steven
[0:53:47] <%FutaSnek> LUL
[0:53:50] <viewtifulr> only half, its fiiine
[0:53:50] <darkodargon> i wanna play this so bad
[0:53:51] <%FutaSnek> BONK EM
[0:54:08] <+UltraViolet371> look at that 60fps pupper
[0:54:08] <%thbluewarden> Gief has awakened
[0:54:11] <%OG_M_Bison> Gief just wants to play FeelsBadMan
[0:54:11] <%FutaSnek> I usually occupy
[0:54:14] <%legendfather_of_giants> sack then occupy if you have enough movement @PatStaresAt
[0:54:17] <oda_flobunaga> Raze or nothing
[0:54:24] <+lordericter> not really worth to sack unless you are getting meat or like 4k plus money
[0:54:29] <%Valdorick> Home Province should always be Occupy. not home, turn it in a sack farm.
[0:54:32] <+lordericter> unless you are Khorne
[0:54:35] <+lordericter> then burn it all
[0:54:36] <%FutaSnek> Slannesh FTW
[0:54:45] <%notsoy> sacking is if you don't intend or can't afford to stick around
[0:54:53] <bourgeoisdaemon> Amblepeak first
[0:54:54] <+zircuits> sack and occupy is good if you're not worried about revolts or one's going to occur anyway
[0:54:57] <CatRidder> Success so clearly in view or is it merely a trick of the light
[0:55:00] <%QuasarKnightGaming> We Ogre-ing now?
[0:55:06] <%FutaSnek> PISS TIME
[0:55:07] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt towers are very bad for when you use large units bc they can single target
[0:55:08] <darkodargon> the enemy towers are nuts
[0:55:13] <%QuasarKnightGaming> I guess Nurgle scaling issue happened?
[0:55:16] <%notsoy> some races/lords get big modifiers to sacking money, you can potentially get 100k from sacking ulthuan
[0:55:17] <+p4ntless> occupy if you wanna keep it, raze if you want to hurt the other faction and don't want it, sack if you want to hurt the other faction and also farm them
[0:55:18] <%legendfather_of_giants> if your public order's fine sack+occupy is just free money
[0:55:23] <%DianaTheAscian> Piss is being fired
[0:55:30] <Gelphaze> Got to eat!
[0:55:34] <%RetroCop87> Pat shits and ponders at
[0:55:36] <%notsoy> no, you have to repair all the buildings regardless
[0:55:40] <+ReefTheWizard> washroom is the best place to strategize, we got us a commode commander
[0:55:45] <+zircuits> dark elves can sack easily that per settlement with their rites and bonuses too
[0:55:53] <+StromkoPenguin> You have to pay to fix the main settlement and other buildings if you sack and occupy, so not necessarily free money.
[0:55:58] <%FutaSnek> NGL I kinda miss the persona music as the intermission tunes\
[0:55:59] <+StromkoPenguin> Unless you don't repair it ever.
[0:56:01] <%notsoy> so loot+occupy is generally counterproductive
[0:56:14] <%KetsuoTaberu> KetsuoTaberu subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months! baby time
[0:56:18] <+legendfather_of_giants> i dont think i've ever had repair costs be larger than the sack money
[0:56:40] <+zircuits> It can be, buildings that are damaged also reduce public order even further
[0:56:43] <zettig> Is having a high-end computer necessary for this kind of game? This looks fun, but I only have laptop with a GeForce 1060.
[0:56:49] <+p4ntless> also gotta remember that sack/raze/etc values are different for different factions
[0:56:50] <%RetroCop87> @FutaSnek persona was intro music, intermission music was some genesis-sounding tune
[0:56:53] <oda_flobunaga> Raze, leave nothing to fix
[0:56:57] <%FutaSnek> HALLO!
[0:56:58] <+zircuits> so it's only if it's really high tier settlements that have usually already been sacked
[0:56:59] <%Monkeyweed21> @legendfather_of_giants the real penalty is control, I believe low control reduces income
[0:57:08] <kuningaz45> dnoFOOBAW dnoFOOBAW dnoFOOBAW dnoFOOBAW
[0:57:13] <bourgeoisdaemon> Ruined
[0:57:17] <darkodargon> thats def not skaven
[0:57:18] <kazadaz> (It might be rats)
[0:57:19] <%ArceusStarDestroyer> SKAVEN
[0:57:26] <bourgeoisdaemon> Send a new lord to colonise it solo
[0:57:26] <darkodargon> kappa
[0:57:27] <%RetroCop87> YOU MUST CONSTRUCT ADDITIONAL PYLONS
[0:57:28] <%ArceusStarDestroyer> LOTS OF SKAVEN
[0:57:30] <%Chex868> ahhh
[0:57:32] <+zircuits> also reduces growth but ogre settlements seem to only go up to tier 3 so
[0:57:33] <bourgeoisdaemon> Send the army to fight the war!
[0:57:33] <+scarman125> definitely not rats
[0:57:34] <%legendfather_of_giants> @Monkeyweed21 yeah, hence why you do it if your control's going to be fine, like if you're sticking around for a bit
[0:57:34] <%fat_burtreynolds> Pat gotta gonna watch some tiktoks on the toliet?
[0:57:37] <%VioletHeart> It won't be rats here. Rats aren't in TW3.
[0:57:42] <%Chex868> guys rat men dont exist
[0:57:44] <BigFingerRo> YOU REQUIRE MORE VESPINE GAS
[0:57:48] <bourgeoisdaemon> @VioletHeart They are
[0:57:55] <%Valdorick> I'm sure there's nothing there. I know this, because large Ratmen aren't real, and if you see someone saying they are, please them tell me about them so I can give them Sigmar's guidance.
[0:57:57] <%OG_M_Bison> This skill tree kinda lackin not gonna lie
[0:57:59] <kazadaz> There are at least 3 NPC rat factions
[0:57:59] <bourgeoisdaemon> Send a fresh lord to check out the ruins!
[0:58:01] <%legendfather_of_giants> @VioletHeart rats are there, just not playable
[0:58:02] <%ConLin_Arts_> what da baby doin
[0:58:04] <%OG_M_Bison> From what I can see anyway
[0:58:11] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt if you have a control group you have to unlock them later or else they just hold position ad it causes the weird movement you saw
[0:58:12] <%fat_burtreynolds> Didn’t think there’d be rats here
[0:58:19] <%ConLin_Arts_> Gief noo
[0:58:24] <%VioletHeart> Oh the Skaven are here? I figured they wouldn't around until Mortal Empires.
[0:58:29] <%FutaSnek> wat the dog doin
[0:58:29] <+ReefTheWizard> doggo
[0:58:31] <%fat_burtreynolds> The Autumn Wind is a Raider
[0:58:32] <darkodargon> omg that missile str
[0:58:44] <%legendfather_of_giants> then they'll die in a cool formation
[0:58:45] <%Valdorick> No, Macro at the start of battle, Micro later on
[0:58:46] <%notsoy> formations don't matter in tight spaces
[0:58:49] <+rafaelba93> hold alt and drag?
[0:58:50] <%tusk102> they're ogres not a proper military
[0:58:51] <BliVru> Abandon thy Formation goblins
[0:58:51] <+zircuits> ogre hunters are walking cannons
[0:58:51] <kazadaz> Cool formations are for field battles, you gotta micro sieges
[0:58:54] <darkodargon> @FutaSnek hes opressing the prolitareate
[0:58:56] <+zircuits> plus bonus 100 antilarge
[0:58:56] <Yomamma1337> then do it yourself
[0:58:59] <Zombrocom> That's fine you an open field battle, but not so great when your cool formation has to fit inside a chokepoint
[0:59:01] <huskarl_zap> immune
[0:59:02] <bourgeoisdaemon> IT IS
[0:59:11] <+ReefTheWizard> did you ever figure out what "meats" were?
[0:59:11] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt ogres are so big that specific formations can cause them to get stuxk on each other
[0:59:22] <%legendfather_of_giants> formations don't deal with chokepoints well
[0:59:40] <+ryderbootz> get em pat kill those guys
[0:59:50] <%tusk102> psaDogchamp
[0:59:59] <%cade_calrayn> HE MUST FIND THE FORBIDDEN THING

[1:00:30] <kazadaz> I'm yelling but Gief refuses to look at me
[1:00:31] <+JustToWatch> he is so wide I love him
[1:00:47] <%cade_calrayn> Gief may be british but that doesn't mean he's high-class in any way
[1:00:51] <BliVru> @patstaresat Did you watched any of Okoii's videos?
[1:00:59] <dundore77> you'll want to put this in a forward area you will be attacking from
[1:01:18] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt formations are bad for thin spaces, especially because ogres are so large that they will get stuck on one another. In open spaces its not as big an issue
[1:01:23] <dundore77> next to the maw button at the bottom center
[1:01:24] <brachydios777> Gief is basically an Ogre as a dog

[1:08:46] <kazadaz> The presence of rats means your boys are leaving leftovers lying around which isn't very ogrey
[1:08:47] <Pyrrhus90> ratmen? nonsense
[1:08:49] <Admiral_PopnFresh> celebrating yet another birthday bash
[1:08:55] <+zircuits> just a small pest problem, probably no big deal Kappa
[1:08:58] <%fat_burtreynolds> Do you like pineapples pat? psaBougie
[1:08:58] <%Nekros4442> @justtowatch yes, they'll be rolled in after a couple months
[1:09:02] <%OG_M_Bison> @JustToWatch The factions from the previous games are in for the AIs to play as but they won't be available to play for a few months
[1:09:12] <$lotharrio> @FutaSnek Nope, they worship a giant hole in the ground and are always, always hungry.
[1:09:20] <Pistofficer> im so happy you can preload on game pass. this game is chonky
[1:09:26] <%Felhad> @futasnek Neither are Nurgle or even Chaos related
[1:09:27] <kazadaz> You're at peace with the rats, IMO you should go north and finish off those ogres first
[1:09:32] <%ArceusStarDestroyer> You should be bable to encamp stance your army and replenish better
[1:09:34] <%notsoy> the landmark is in one of your cities, not the camp
[1:09:38] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt at the great hall
[1:09:40] <dundore77> landmarks are only in certain settlements looks like a gold obilisk on the overmap
[1:09:40] <%FutaSnek> Ahhh I see
[1:09:40] <BigYanno> It's like a seamark but on land
[1:09:42] <bourgeoisdaemon> At the first settlement there's gold and a landmark building
[1:09:51] <plaguedoctor_vi> it a speacial building that related to the place
[1:09:57] <%notsoy> you can save growth instead to level up the camp
[1:09:57] <%MelBrooksKA> It's a piece of land that you mark @PatStaresAt
[1:10:05] <+brandonsbetow> skavens early game can get super fucked with monstrous units
[1:10:06] <%FutaSnek> Thank U chat <#
[1:10:09] <%FutaSnek> <3
[1:10:15] <+brandonsbetow> the only ones more fucked are skellies
[1:10:18] <BigYanno> please make sure they wash before you nob blar's box
[1:10:36] <bourgeoisdaemon> Wrong settlment again
[1:10:36] <Yomamma1337> only in certain cities
[1:10:44] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt you want to demolish that money building
[1:10:44] <kazadaz> and after, blar is not known for hygiene
[1:10:47] <%Felhad> @futasnek Ogres have some really interesting lore, would recommend a wiki dive
[1:10:53] <dundore77> @PatStaresAt its in the great hall of greasus see the icons to the left of the build settlements the obilisk indicates landmark
[1:10:53] <%fat_burtreynolds> Bibbiddy bing bonged PogChamp
[1:11:01] <%tusk102> just dont suck
[1:11:11] <bourgeoisdaemon> At the Great Hall of Greasus there is a unique building, and a gold mine you haven't built
[1:11:29] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt you wasted a slot on that generic income building instead of the gold mine or landmark
[1:11:49] <Sheepeze> Should probably go into encamp stance if you are recruiting, as it lets you recruit globally and locally.
[1:11:52] <dundore77> scroll bar
[1:11:53] <%notsoy> did you try scrolling?
[1:11:53] <kazadaz> Gotta scroll
[1:11:54] <+BoyholeSnake> scroll?
[1:12:03] <+BoyholeSnake> Hello?
[1:12:05] <IronHorseDell> scroll LUL
[1:12:07] <%TheAdMerlin> It was there, and he exited
[1:12:11] <Zombrocom> Whats a scroll bar
[1:12:11] <%FutaSnek> @Felhad I mean so do all the warhammer factions, there's so many talented writers behind the scenes, I'll def check it out tho
[1:12:27] <%Felhad> lol, very true
[1:12:28] <%strakillias> Great hall of Greasus is a land mark location. Click on the city then go to the building browser to see what the landmark is. The bldg browser is the little house with two child houses. Sometimes only the main settlement chain is the landmark.
[1:12:36] <%notsoy> use force march stance to go farther in one turn, but it's risky when not in safe territory
[1:12:38] <plaguedoctor_vi> Usually you can´t get peace with the first faction you are in war with
[1:13:20] <%Felhad> I'm just partial to Ogres because that's what I played in tabletop
[1:13:24] <%IamGrapes> these the Orb Boys with the mind goblins?
[1:13:30] <dundore77> they have their own army too. you can recruit for your garrison
[1:13:43] <%Felhad> Orb boys with lesser goblins
[1:13:48] <+lordericter> sit in base forever
[1:13:54] <%Monkeyweed21> minor settlements
[1:13:54] <%notsoy> the building is probably in stationary cities, but not camps
[1:14:00] <bourgeoisdaemon> Heroes can often provide untainted, but some races are bad at getting rid of corruption
[1:14:03] <+lordericter> like literally sit in a major settlement for a random number of turns
[1:14:22] <+ryderbootz> gotta have that juicy shaq meat
[1:14:27] <%Jeemukun> good old meat, nothing beats that!
[1:14:42] <%SirGO0SE> hi pat and chat :) we having fun?
[1:14:48] <Zombrocom> Greasus be rollin out
[1:14:52] <greenoni> Great hall of Greasus has a land mark. Click on the city then go to the building browser to see what the landmark is. The building browser is the icon with the 3 houses
[1:14:52] <%fat_burtreynolds> BloodTrail
[1:14:53] <Admiral_PopnFresh> the ogres have learned to implement *gasp* edged weapons
[1:15:01] <bourgeoisdaemon> Save growth to tier up main building
[1:15:35] <%notsoy> stimulate growth is always nice
[1:16:00] <%OG_M_Bison> Growth = good
[1:16:04] <bourgeoisdaemon> That's ok
[1:16:08] <Chaos_Aether> We know
[1:16:13] <Zombrocom> Eh, its fine. Just eat people and vibe.
[1:16:14] <dundore77> ambush?
[1:16:15] <bourgeoisdaemon> Don't siege!
[1:16:16] <%Monkeyweed21> we know
[1:16:18] <+Jack8274> I've been used to that for almost 10 years now Pat
[1:16:23] <bourgeoisdaemon> Ambush from outside
[1:16:23] <%OG_M_Bison> Does anybody really know what they're doing?
[1:16:36] <%FutaSnek> @PatStaresAt Ogres were made by the old one, but since their influence got cut of early with the collapse of the polar gates they were left unfinished according to the wiki
[1:16:44] <%Nekros4442> as a general rule, you need money and to get ur people fucking for growth early in the game. You're doing fine
[1:16:45] <Zombrocom> They probably wont walk into an ambush
[1:16:45] <brachydios777> What are plans really?
[1:16:56] <bourgeoisdaemon> Yeah you need to be a little back from the settlement, then ambush may succeed, only way to clear out that army
[1:17:18] <bigboy3d> that dude is angry
[1:17:23] <bourgeoisdaemon> The fucken skaven!
[1:17:30] <Zombrocom> RAT
[1:17:36] <%Nekros4442> Those are some brave rats
[1:17:41] <Admiral_PopnFresh> RATS RATS

[1:18:01] <%Undenizen> rat boys best boys
[1:18:03] <%Nekros4442> the flood of rats
[1:18:03] <brachydios777> The Rats The Rats, They’re the Rats
[1:18:05] <%Monkeyweed21> should have killed the rats
[1:18:08] <Zombrocom> That is a lot of fucking rats
[1:18:11] <dundore77> camps count as raiding a region you pissed off the rats
[1:18:11] <%Faustgesicht> Faustgesicht subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 37 months! Yo pat, hope the ogre lads are fun! Of the factions in III you've played so far, which one you liking most?
[1:18:13] <+zircuits> there are at lesat 4 rats
[1:18:14] <%QuasarKnightGaming> So thats the end of this playthrough
[1:18:15] <%DianaTheAscian> Holy shit
[1:18:15] <bourgeoisdaemon> They don't like you settling their territory
[1:18:18] <%FutaSnek> OH GOD WE WANDERED INTO THE YIFF PILE
[1:18:19] <%SaiyanShoto> Do it
[1:18:23] <%Nekros4442> so many skavenslaves
[1:18:24] <BliVru> Skaven in chat Monkas
[1:18:27] <+zircuits> more than I'd want in my home
[1:18:27] <+Jack8274> LUL Still the same from Warhammer 2, don't believe their lies
[1:18:31] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> Always kill the rats, those fuckers grow at a super fast pace
[1:18:36] <bourgeoisdaemon> Hold one point only! Build towers there
[1:18:42] <+lordericter> try and make a chokepoint with your supply towers
[1:18:45] <%FutaSnek> LUL RAT BSH]
[1:18:50] <+lordericter> you can probably kill 1000 at least
[1:18:53] <Sheepeze> On the bright side rat units tend to be garbage
[1:18:53] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Skaven in chat? there's no such thing as Skaven
[1:18:54] <%MelBrooksKA> Somebodies gettin' FUUUUUCKED
[1:18:55] <brachydios777> Fight combat will go great good, yes yes!
[1:18:57] <signofzeta> deploy the rat poison
[1:18:57] <KaiserMario> Kill that tide of vermins
[1:18:58] <%Monkeyweed21> frame perfect rat bashing
[1:19:00] <bearablepuns> I mean. 1 rat equals like...100 ogres right? monkaS
[1:19:02] <%jamsbybetty> Are ya winnin', son?!
[1:19:05] <%strakillias> Reload the auto save and raise a lord and throw him in the camp to give yourself that tiny bit of extra strength.
[1:19:08] <bourgeoisdaemon> Any of them, just gotta get the towers shootin
[1:19:09] <Zourath> Just build a moat, right?
[1:19:12] <+sermittens> have to funnel
[1:19:15] <+sermittens> like 300
[1:19:19] <%FutaSnek> Jesus main and hide behind those 2 humps
[1:19:21] <+Jack8274> Do you need to build them?
[1:19:36] <KaiserMario> Just go to a pond or something, rats can't swim
[1:19:39] <bourgeoisdaemon> You gotta build towers connected to the point you're defending
[1:19:44] <Hanyusha> love you
[1:19:45] <%FutaSnek> Choke point them
[1:19:50] <darkodargon> you nee too hold on and generate suply
[1:19:59] <%SirGO0SE> rats rats we are the rats
[1:20:04] <%FutaSnek> Gotta pull the 300 sparten move
[1:20:05] <+Jack8274> Those are rats alright
[1:20:09] <Zombrocom> What happy rats
[1:20:09] <darkodargon> its just clan rats they die easy
[1:20:10] <%Valdorick> What's worse - they have stealthed units, *there's more rats there than you seeing*
[1:20:11] <%Faustgesicht> Those are indeed rats
[1:20:13] <%Chex868> slaves
[1:20:16] <Zombrocom> Because those are SLAVE rats
[1:20:17] <%Nekros4442> skavenslaves
[1:20:18] <bourgeoisdaemon> Yeah you don't, hence holding one point with maxxed towers
[1:20:20] <%Valdorick> Clan Rats vs Slaves
[1:20:21] <%Felhad> You do have an especially small force, but rats will always outnumber you
[1:20:22] <%FutaSnek> lesser rats monkaS
[1:20:22] <Admiral_PopnFresh> because they are fleshy and without hair
[1:20:22] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> rats brake super easily
[1:20:23] <CriticKitten> Oh man, that's a lot of rat
[1:20:24] <%Faustgesicht> Shame there's no water
[1:20:26] <signofzeta> very gross, very icky rats
[1:20:28] <+Ches_Neckbeard> Skaven always have super high numbers up super low morale. they retreat at the drop of a hat
[1:20:28] <+sermittens> I think the ai is stupid and will funnel itself
[1:20:28] <%SirGO0SE> (Michael) its your birthday today
[1:20:29] <+Jack8274> We are the Rats who make all of the rules
[1:20:35] <quaznil> rat murder
[1:20:38] <%FutaSnek> OH JOY
[1:20:48] <+VariantHuman> In old tabletop Skaven leaders used to lead from the back instead of front

[1:20:59] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> Summon the Ubersreik Five to kill all the rats.
[1:21:04] <%Undenizen> did he say "I'll smell ya!"?
[1:21:05] <%chance_h> has pat encountered the vampires yet? like Count Bofa?
[1:21:06] <brachydios777> Skaven are a bigger problem than Orkz
[1:21:08] <quaznil> This is gonna be good
[1:21:08] <+UltraViolet371> some moats would be real effective. cause water...
[1:21:10] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt dont hold formation, tight spaces hate that

[1:22:01] <%FutaSnek> Their little peanut jig
[1:22:06] <+Ches_Neckbeard> Skaven like single handedly wrecked the entire world in the old setting.
[1:22:10] <+ryderbootz> dis aint gunna go well
[1:22:11] <+sermittens> need to use the rats to flank to the back of units to deal more damage
[1:22:16] <bourgeoisdaemon> AOE
[1:22:22] <%Valdorick> There are many Rats, so either get something fast, or something with nice AoE
[1:22:35] <signofzeta> pray for the ogres
[1:22:36] <bourgeoisdaemon> Cannon tower
[1:22:39] <Zombrocom> I mean, lets be real. He's fucked.

[1:22:45] <CriticKitten> Many rats yes yes
[1:22:45] <Zombrocom> There is no winning this.
[1:22:47] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> @NigelSchnauzerpug That's all I wanted someone to say.
[1:22:47] <Mattais88> Is there a Warhammer Fantasy race equivalent to the Necrons?
[1:22:48] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt skaven break easy, focus on towers
[1:22:49] <+Jack8274> LUL
[1:22:52] <Admiral_PopnFresh> @FutaSnek btw very unsurprising that a someone named "FutaSnek" is a Slaanesh player

[1:22:53] <%notsoy> he's 100% fucked

[1:28:12] <%Valdorick> They hit you with 1 rat army and the town garrison.
[1:28:13] <tigerfang86> whers the giant rat that makes all of DA RULEZ
[1:28:14] <Zombrocom> RIP gorg
[1:28:14] <Ghufufin> those no good cheatin rats
[1:28:15] <CriticKitten> rofl
[1:28:19] <%notsoy> bye bye camp, oof
[1:28:23] <%FutaSnek> @Fuggins4U AYYYYYY
[1:28:28] <bourgeoisdaemon> Defence defence defence
[1:28:34] <Samsquonch> ey that's the voice actor of the old Abyss man in Dark Souls 2 isnt it
[1:28:36] <+p4ntless> on the upside your stonehorn could probably solo all of those rats
[1:28:40] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt got any units who do aoe damage?
[1:28:40] <bourgeoisdaemon> No economy, defence!
[1:28:43] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> A tip for fighting the rats is to take out the lord first, most of their units have shit leadership and break easily
[1:28:49] <CriticKitten> You lose to rats ONE TIME and your helper guy is like "yeah maybe consider diplomacy?" LUL
[1:28:52] <Hanyusha> so the game just called you a chicken?
[1:28:55] <CriticKitten> Rough teacher
[1:28:55] <bourgeoisdaemon> You can't ambush that close it'll fail!
[1:28:59] <dundore77> try to ambush in trees if this fails
[1:29:09] <+UltraViolet371> @Samsquonch Oh yeah Darkdiver Grendal or something, sounds like it could be
[1:29:13] <Hanyusha> "ugh I guess you can be diplomatic so weak and boring though"
[1:29:16] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt stonehorns are good for rats
[1:29:18] <Zourath> Should've built a moat. Rats cannot get around a good moat.
[1:29:19] <Zombrocom> Uh. Rats. Incoming.
[1:29:21] <signofzeta> we can appease the rats with cheese
[1:29:27] <@Fuggins4U> choese
[1:29:30] <%DianaTheAscian> yup
[1:29:31] <%notsoy> wow, they autosave the last 5 turns? neat
[1:29:34] <%Valdorick> Look on the bright side. A Skaven Warlock Engineer would have ended that fight before the tower was even built.
[1:29:34] <%Brassnarwhal> @zourath how could they
[1:29:35] <dundore77> pat is a total war gamer like me
[1:29:36] <%tusk102> big coward
[1:29:37] <Zourath> They can't swim, after all.
[1:29:39] <%OG_M_Bison> psaBlind
[1:29:41] <bourgeoisdaemon> This why defence buildings matter
[1:29:45] <Treasure_Vault> Savescumming is actually really courageous and heroic
[1:29:47] <%SveriSageAdvice> what if you texted Paige for cheese
[1:29:48] <%FutaSnek> To be fair the Rats have ended the warhammer universe on multiplie occasions
[1:29:49] <@Fuggins4U> a choese moat
[1:29:50] <%Brassnarwhal> basically just build a raft and you are immune to rats
[1:29:55] <@Fuggins4U> hot queso for defense
[1:29:57] <%OG_M_Bison> Save scumming is important to learn from your mistakes tbh
[1:29:59] <Zombrocom> You can set the autosave to whatever you want. Even every turn if ya want
[1:30:02] <%notsoy> kill the skaven this time
[1:30:03] <%Valdorick> They do, *they still amtter*
[1:30:08] <%Undenizen> I like how this wise old sage is like "Yeah, fuck smart people and diplomats!"
[1:30:12] <dundore77> maybe start a new army to the north?
[1:30:13] <Manwad> get they ass
[1:30:18] <%Brassnarwhal> @futasnek that's hard to believe, how did they deal with all the oceans
[1:30:19] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt they do take slots, but without them you'll get fucked
[1:30:24] <bourgeoisdaemon> Defence buildings take up a slot but they are basically free armies
[1:30:28] <%Valdorick> Would you rather have 3 slots, or 2 slots and the town still under your control?
[1:30:48] <%fat_burtreynolds> How much would someone have to pay to you eat a cookie with a paper clip hidden somewhere inside?
[1:30:50] <%KineticZen> D:
[1:30:50] <huskarl_zap> three armies there
[1:30:51] <%OG_M_Bison> NANI????
[1:30:54] <tubit> NotLikeThis
[1:30:57] <AmusingMantis> RATS
[1:30:57] <dundore77> @PatStaresAt You can still build that gold pit and landmark in the first city
[1:30:59] <%OG_M_Bison> D:
[1:31:00] <tntmen9> seems we got a rat problem
[1:31:01] <Admiral_PopnFresh> octoNa octoNi
[1:31:03] <CriticKitten> Whaaaaaat? D:
[1:31:04] <Valentinius_Anodyne> friends :)
[1:31:05] <+Leebrownie> I'm eating chips
[1:31:07] <Manwad> GET EM
[1:31:10] <Hanyusha> Allies? Nope, more rats
[1:31:10] <+upandadam> battle is nigh!!!
[1:31:10] <%templar010> WAR
[1:31:11] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt do you want 3 slots, or do you want 2 slots and a thing that keeps the town under your control
[1:31:15] <brachydios777> Always fucking rats
[1:31:18] <%Valdorick> Rats don't fuck around.
[1:31:18] <Zombrocom> That is like 5000 rats
[1:31:21] <%Monkeyweed21> MANY RATS
[1:31:23] <CriticKitten> ROFL the game has no faith in your ability to beat rats apparently
[1:31:24] <+JustToWatch> MEAT UP
[1:31:28] <%OG_M_Bison> Hmmm
[1:31:29] <%tusk102> 5000 rats
[1:31:30] <%Brassnarwhal> give em the itsy bitsy spider treatment pat
[1:31:30] <%Valdorick> Don't worry, I'm sure its just undervaluing your Stonehorn
[1:31:34] <$SGrim> Meat time
[1:31:36] <%tusk102> MEAT TIME
[1:31:37] <bourgeoisdaemon> Go back a little and ambush em, or encircle
[1:31:37] <viewtifulr> WAAARG gmartSour
[1:31:41] <+Romuken> mmmmm, rat soup
[1:31:42] <%OG_M_Bison> I mean they don't even have any ratling gunners or anything
[1:31:45] <+p4ntless> how 2 kill many rat: rush them down and kill their leaders
[1:31:46] <Zombrocom> Ok pat, REMEMBER THE TOWERS HURT this time
[1:31:48] <%OG_M_Bison> I think you'll be good
[1:31:53] <%Valdorick> Tip - Micro the stonehorn to fucking kill the shit out of slingers
[1:31:54] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt stonehorns can slam through rats
[1:31:54] <Hanyusha> I think he didn't press the meat button
[1:31:55] <AGuyNamedFrank> you thought it was allies BUT IT WAS ME, RATS, ALL ALONG!
[1:31:56] <+UltraViolet371> orb is fed
[1:31:57] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Get that meal before the Hunt
[1:32:01] <%AJ_Cherenkov> Yes
[1:32:02] <+JustToWatch> that's right Pat
[1:32:03] <%tusk102> HIT THE TOWERS
[1:32:04] <azure_dunes> precisely
[1:32:05] <bourgeoisdaemon> Towers die if the point is captured
[1:32:05] <dundore77> you have to use range weapons which he doesn't have
[1:32:07] <%ArceusStarDestroyer> If you capture points they dissapear
[1:32:07] <%fat_burtreynolds> Rateatoullie but with real rats!
[1:32:10] <%FutaSnek> I think skaven could build boats, they'
[1:32:11] <%notsoy> taking strategic points destroys fortifications connected to them
[1:32:13] <+p4ntless> there's only two or three units in that entire skaven force that can actually threaten you
[1:32:15] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> Ignore the towers. They can't hurt you if you don't pay attention to them.
[1:32:23] <GhostlySkunk> Wuddup gurls
[1:32:28] <%OG_M_Bison> Honestly the only reason I see you losing is cause of the towers
[1:32:31] <%FutaSnek> they'd be shit be skaven could build boats
[1:32:34] <%Undenizen> iunno why you're listening to anyone, pat. no one has this game yet.
[1:32:34] <+scarman125> oh man look at that shit fountain
[1:32:35] <%Monkeyweed21> cap points to kill towers and get momentum
[1:32:37] <%Valdorick> Don't Skaven have the most advanced Boat tech in Warhammer?
[1:32:39] <%GalacticaPhanto> GalacticaPhanto subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 35 months! Wow look at all those months! Leveling WAR because I need to feel UNGA after DRK makes me feel bad to use
[1:32:44] <HotSauceFiend> I have never played this game before but why jump into a battle that says Valiant defeat for you
[1:32:53] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> At least this is a shit place for the rats
[1:32:53] <Manwad> the PIT
[1:32:54] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt the towers will fuck you up as good as your towers will fuck them up if you buils town defences
[1:32:54] <%Valdorick> Yeyeye! The Underway!
[1:33:02] <penitentpendant> I thought you could click and drag where your reinforcements spawn? It would just add time to their timer.
[1:33:04] <Yomamma1337> @HotSauceFiend because the game is wrong most of the time
[1:33:06] <brachydios777> Skaven can make miniguns
[1:33:14] <%Valdorick> Grind it up and snort it!
[1:33:15] <%Brassnarwhal> @valdorick of course the guys who can't swim have great boats thats just being consistent with reality
[1:33:15] <darkodargon> ye time to smoke some warpstone
[1:33:15] <%AJ_Cherenkov> bcus you can do better than the autoresolve, if you know what you're doing
[1:33:17] <bourgeoisdaemon> @HotSauceFiend if you can't beat autoresolve it's time to lower difficulty
[1:33:18] <AmusingMantis> SNIFF-SNORT AS MUCH-MUCH WARPSTONE AS POSSIBLE
[1:33:18] <dundore77> @HotSauceFiend the autoresolve is heavily in favor of AI. he can win this
[1:33:27] <monster_craft23> Hey pat. Happy VD
[1:33:32] <%AJ_Cherenkov> @penitentpendant isn't that their reinforcement?
[1:33:45] <%OG_M_Bison> I think the autoresolve always favors big trash mob armies in these games
[1:33:48] <penitentpendant> @AJ_Cherenkov Ah! Fair!
[1:33:50] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt dont hold formation bc its thin spaces tho
[1:33:51] <%FutaSnek> @HotSauceFiend Its about the battle not the war, and with manual control he can take more of the CPU's units
[1:33:51] <Kevmo117> I am once again asking for your game code
[1:33:52] <doster504> Who is the large unit on the far left?
[1:33:56] <bourgeoisdaemon> Plan to get to their capture points
[1:34:11] <brachydios777> Use warpstone as money currency! Use it as food food. Grind it up and snort it!
[1:34:15] <%Dakuu75> WOAH~!!! Pat getting up at 60fps scared me

[1:34:53] <bourgeoisdaemon> Pat your mass means you can break through their weak infantry. Plan to get to the capture points and don't let their lousy infantry slow you down, charge and then keep moving thru em to the points.  Capping all points wins automatically.
[1:34:55] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt aim for capture points and towers, and dont hold position/formation/control cuz they'll get stuck going through small places (this map has a ton of small places)

[1:35:02] <%fat_burtreynolds> GAME OVER YEAH!!!!!!!!
[1:35:12] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt skaven are weak bitches so pick a path to the victory point and then rush it
[1:35:13] <Zombrocom> There is like 5000 rats in your way now
[1:35:19] <dundore77> only ranged units can attack towers
[1:35:22] <bourgeoisdaemon> PUNCH THROUGH
[1:35:24] <%fat_burtreynolds> psaElmostare psaGib psaWink psaPorgmo most precious child
[1:35:30] <darkodargon> wow that tower got shreaded
[1:35:30] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt skavens lose morale fast so target their leaders
[1:35:32] <Hanyusha> as a fella once said, ain't that a kick in the head?
[1:35:47] <+scarman125> only ranged and flying can hurt towers
[1:35:56] <%Valdorick> Have Gnoblers join that attack, so your guys don't get swarmed and killed
[1:35:58] <bourgeoisdaemon> Where's da capture point?
[1:35:59] <brachydios777> @brassnarwhal But can teeth teeth make create Death Wheel!?
[1:36:02] <+Infernal_Dalek> @tusk102 Target da big rats that make all the rules?
[1:36:07] <%AJ_Cherenkov> trappers taking the tower to pound town there
[1:36:19] <%tusk102> @tusk102 indeed
[1:36:25] <bourgeoisdaemon> Kill missiles with bigboy
[1:36:47] <+RemedyofRevenge> Is Pat in full back seat mode or is it shut the fuck up until asked for?
[1:36:47] <%Valdorick> Did Pat just charge his big guys into missile and tower range without support?
[1:36:53] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> Run through them and fuck their lord up
[1:36:54] <Zombrocom> Remember, if you take the points, they lost their towers and you get stat buffs
[1:37:24] <bourgeoisdaemon> Break through, don't get stuck fighting
[1:37:27] <kazadaz> Ahh, they haven't fixed the pit bullshit
[1:37:29] <VJdarkworld> WELCOME TO THE PIT
[1:37:46] <Zombrocom> Oh god there is so many rats

[1:38:41] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt thats good, punching through their lines is the tactic for anti skavens
[1:38:49] <%baka_sugoi> HUN GREEEY

[1:39:58] <%Monkeyweed21> rush the point
[1:40:11] <%AncelDeLambert> ZERG RUSH!
[1:40:16] <%AncelDeLambert> throw everything!
[1:40:18] <darkodargon> time to eat lads

[1:40:34] <brachydios777> Time for rat burgers
[1:40:46] <darkodargon> this is going pretty good
[1:40:58] <%Buzzard42> Buzzard42 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 23 months! 
[1:41:02] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt you really need to rush the points
[1:41:02] <kazadaz> Only shooters of flyers can hit towers
[1:41:14] <+scarman125> @PatStaresAt only range and flying units can hurts towers
[1:41:27] <%fat_burtreynolds> E RAT ICATED psaDabb
[1:41:29] <+sermittens> have your big monster run into the giant mass of enemies
[1:41:35] <darkodargon> pat you are epic
[1:41:37] <Zombrocom> Capture the points to destroy the towers
[1:41:38] <%Valdorick> 2 ranged units and your Hunter shouldn't be wasted on them.
[1:41:40] <kazadaz> Ignore chat, only trust ME
[1:41:40] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt your ranged units are good and smashed the tower near instantly is why
[1:41:41] <%Monkeyweed21> TAKE THE POINTS
[1:41:47] <%OG_M_Bison> I dunno who told him to attack the towers. That was a shitty strat LUL
[1:41:49] <%legendfather_of_giants> because they're like 50% of your casualties
[1:41:52] <%Valdorick> Have you found their general yet? Their general should fucking die-die
[1:41:56] <%OG_M_Bison> Without artillery you won't do anything to them
[1:42:14] <+scarman125> yeah I woulda just taken the capture point
[1:42:14] <%Monkeyweed21> you need to cap points fast when attacking or else you got shot up by towers
[1:42:15] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> he is by himself actually
[1:42:25] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> ripe for the taking
[1:42:25] <Zombrocom> If you don't capture the points, those towers are going to kill you
[1:42:32] <%Dakuu75> could he just ignore the towers and get outa their range?
[1:42:37] <darkodargon> the gheneral is see him
[1:42:42] <darkodargon> by your stone horn
[1:42:43] <%Valdorick> Note that even if you push through, Ogres are Monster units, so have MUCH weaker capture weight than rats
[1:43:02] <kazadaz> The rats are tarpitting you very effectively
[1:43:18] <%Valdorick> Army Losses can tip that scale very VERY fast
[1:43:39] <%Treuan> I run into the same problems early in campaign :(
[1:43:44] <brachydios777> If it weren’t for Tyranids already being there the Skaven would be a big problem if they ever showed up in 40k
[1:43:54] <%Valdorick> RAT LEADER! Right there!
[1:43:59] <%Dakuu75> I don't play RTS games so, I 100% don't know wtf is happening

[1:46:42] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> remember to either kill or run down the lord
[1:46:55] <%Valdorick> My god, that Master Assassin has taken 25% of the Stonehorn's health.
[1:46:57] <brachydios777> Skaven is a race of Starscreams
[1:46:58] <%tusk102> @JustTheGuyYouNeed hes doing that now
[1:47:08] <Zombrocom> Greasus should beat anything in a one on one
[1:47:28] <%Valdorick> You have 4 ogres near that Warlord too
[1:47:29] <%tusk102> greasus is strong
[1:47:34] <Zombrocom> Anything rat shaped at least
[1:47:54] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> @JustTheGuyYouNeed I'm talking about when the big rat breaks

[1:48:06] <CranialActivity> Greasus is exactly what I want for Valentines day
[1:48:13] <ChungusQuest> Hold the line!
[1:48:42] <Zombrocom> So... many... rats...
[1:48:49] <%tusk102> individual rats are weak
[1:48:50] <+afrodood> Don’t forget the army ability on the right.
[1:48:52] <kazadaz> One rear-charge will break that whole horseshoe
[1:49:09] <bearablepuns> 🐀 FLEE FLEE
[1:49:13] <+scarman125> I would get that Stonehorn involved in that mosh pit right quick

[1:49:14] <%tusk102> hes fast pat smh
[1:49:35] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt stonehorns are good for hitting hordes
[1:49:36] <%notsoy> KILL LORD
[1:49:40] <brachydios777> FALLBACK RETREAT!
[1:49:41] <darkodargon> got em
[1:49:41] <Zombrocom> You get stat buffs you taking points by the way
[1:49:45] <%Valdorick> I would not expose backside to a Master Assassin.
[1:49:54] <+scarman125> Greasus is gonna get assassinated ignoring the lord
[1:49:54] <%Teintstein> ladies and gentlemen, we got him
[1:50:35] <%XzileGaming> god lord
[1:50:36] <%Valdorick> Just win via Army Losses
[1:50:41] <Zombrocom> Just take the nearby supply points
[1:50:44] <%notsoy> just kill em all
[1:50:45] <brachydios777> So is the great maw actually real in this universe?
[1:50:46] <kazadaz> Pat vs Pit
[1:50:47] <Zombrocom> You get buffs and they lose towers
[1:50:52] <Zourath> Why do the ogres, being the larger units, not simply eat all the rats?
[1:50:58] <bearablepuns> Time to table them :)
[1:51:02] <Zombrocom> The Great Maw is very real
[1:51:06] <kazadaz> @brachydios777 Yeah, it's in southern China
[1:51:14] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt theres a lord right next to you
[1:51:15] <aeravon> greasus is gunna get murdered either by the assassin or the archers
[1:51:24] <%Valdorick> Ruh-roh, frontline is wavering
[1:51:57] <%tusk102> woooooo lord attacking
[1:52:11] <Zombrocom> Towers are slaughtering his units
[1:52:11] <darkodargon> ya know pat is doing all right considering hes a beginer
[1:52:20] <%tusk102> not great
[1:52:37] <+scarman125> Greasus seems like a fucking terrible lord
[1:52:49] <%Valdorick> But the Expendables are fleeing, Hope they rally
[1:52:50] <@Fuggins4U> the luck of the Patrish
[1:52:52] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> Lords are worth a lot of balance points
[1:52:54] <%notsoy> because your monster and lord are still in good shape
[1:52:59] <+RealThiele> yeah towers are winning for the rats
[1:53:06] <%Monkeyweed21> @scarman125 he annihilates big monsters
[1:53:10] <%Chex868> if u clear lord rats will break
[1:53:13] <%tusk102> @scarman125 he can slap the shit out of others in one on ones
[1:53:14] <kazadog> master assassin will fuck up that hunter 1v1
[1:53:16] <%Valdorick> Master Assassins should be respected
[1:53:22] <dds333a> Whoopsie
[1:53:23] <%Ne1son> psaCrazy psaCrazy
[1:53:25] <%strakillias> Skaven = Trash without their guns and artillery
[1:53:29] <kazadaz> You coulda done better, but this was always gonna be a grinding mess of a battle, you've managed the chaos decently
[1:53:37] <Zombrocom> The tower is shooting that hunter to death
[1:54:03] <kazadog> big morale hit for the skaven incoming
[1:54:05] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt if you focus lords you can smash skaven morale
[1:54:15] <aeravon> greasus about dead
[1:54:21] <slix3431> Use the fatness Pat
[1:54:21] <%notsoy> skull = permabroken, don't bother chasing
[1:54:25] <%Valdorick> That unit is shattered, ignore it
[1:54:27] <%tusk102> greasus is close to death
[1:54:27] <%strakillias> Don't spread out too thin
[1:54:35] <%legendfather_of_giants> army-wide ability is up
[1:54:41] <%hairtoday> GREASUS AT RISK
[1:54:48] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt stay grouped up or you'll get picked off
[1:54:55] <Zombrocom> Just kinda charge that stonehorn through rats until they give up
[1:54:58] <%Valdorick> God, those towers are doing work
[1:55:05] <huskarl_zap> take the box icon area
[1:55:16] <%tusk102> @Valdorick its why we told him to build defences on his own bases
[1:55:16] <dds333a> Towers going ham
[1:55:40] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> you got this
[1:55:41] <%Valdorick> Oh, I know why you build defenses, but good god, the new seiges are amazing.
[1:55:47] <%Valdorick> Defense has advantage, finally
[1:55:48] <kazadaz> IMO focus on killing rats; once you hit a certain %age, they'll all autobreak and you'll win
[1:55:49] <huskarl_zap> fast boys
[1:55:53] <Zombrocom> Just capture the nearby supply points and fight the rats there and they will break
[1:56:02] <%Valdorick> Instead of "ignore the walls and towers and hide on the point"
[1:56:40] <huskarl_zap> also taking their supply points gives your army moral buffs called momentum
[1:56:41] <%Valdorick> Oh god, EXISTING is wavering your guys
[1:56:51] <dds333a> LUL
[1:56:54] <%Brassnarwhal> this is starting to look like the liberation of perlia when they were fully fleeing and their numbers were dwindling
[1:56:58] <%Valdorick> Now hold it for 2 minutes.
[1:57:01] <dds333a> Morale continually at risk
[1:57:03] <+scarman125> it was by accident but he finally destroyed the towers coxPog
[1:57:04] <kazadaz> If you keep this up Greasus is gonna start losing weight
[1:57:06] <kazadog> theres only one some maps have more
[1:57:15] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt now hold the point for 2 minutes lol
[1:57:20] <slix3431> You need to be fatter
[1:57:31] <+scarman125> @kazadaz what do you mean? his Gnoblars are doing all the work LUL
[1:57:37] <%Brassnarwhal> meat
[1:57:41] <huskarl_zap> they're gonna break
[1:57:43] <slix3431> BECOME FAT
[1:57:47] <kazadaz> I don't think it does
[1:57:55] <%KineticZen> Yeesh
[1:57:59] <dds333a> He's just passing by LUL
[1:57:59] <%tusk102> welp
[1:58:03] <%legendfather_of_giants> thats what iot used to be, but not anymore
[1:58:04] <aeravon> see. the bar was filling green at the top while you held
[1:58:06] <+polothegreatest> LUL
[1:58:07] <%chance_h> Time is an illusion
[1:58:10] <kazadog> stonehorn mvp
[1:58:12] <aeravon> but you had it sped up
[1:58:14] <+scarman125> it just gives the enemy a leadership debuff
[1:58:19] <kazadaz> 391 kills on the stonehead
[1:58:19] <+lordericter> clapclapclap
[1:58:21] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt it used to be hold for 2 minutes, but they changed it
[1:58:22] <Zombrocom> That sure was a lot of rats
[1:58:25] <%strakillias> And then all the skaven died
[1:58:27] <huskarl_zap> Gnoblar>skaven
[1:58:27] <%tusk102> sorry i forgot they changed it
[1:58:28] <+thickshield> you ate it for sure, but you won. thats all that matters
[1:58:29] <dds333a> Pulled through LUL
[1:58:31] <AmusingMantis> THATS A LOTTA RATS
[1:58:33] <Zombrocom> 3800 rats
[1:58:35] <%Valdorick> RIP hero Ogres, killed 348 rats
[1:58:36] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> Hey, only one unit lost
[1:58:36] <%Brassnarwhal> not failing os passing pat
[1:58:37] <%notsoy> welcome to early-game sieges, it's hell
[1:58:38] <kazadaz> Look battles vs rats are always a giant mess, you managed the chaos pretty well
[1:58:41] <dds333a> JESUS
[1:58:48] <dds333a> Rats DECIMATED
[1:58:51] <Zombrocom> Only lost one unit! Not bad
[1:58:58] <%Valdorick> You did better than the Auto Resolve, and that's always a good thing!
[1:59:02] <%Superego1989> 7 meat 4000 rats
[1:59:03] <+lordericter> every 150 rats is worth about 1 ogre
[1:59:06] <%chance_h> Rats = Drowned
[1:59:08] <%MidnightBurst12> not enough rats
[1:59:08] <+RealThiele> thats a boatload of rats
[1:59:11] <Yomamma1337> you would have guns if you were playing skaven
[1:59:11] <%AncelDeLambert> yeah, and how many of your guys did you lose?
[1:59:12] <%Brassnarwhal> historically accurate siege
[1:59:13] <+lordericter> unless they are rattling guns
[1:59:13] <%rdark_ksu> I killed 4k rats and all I got was this crummy Tshirt
[1:59:15] <%Valdorick> You'd Micro your ranged units to kill monsters
[1:59:15] <Onamar> Lategame you can have every army followed around by an army of JUST slaves to clog shit up
[1:59:16] <+UltraViolet371> 4 billion dead rats
[1:59:17] <huskarl_zap> Now that's micromanagement
[1:59:19] <+polothegreatest> Thats a lot PogBones
[1:59:21] <%notsoy> early-game rats would not have good answers, no
[1:59:21] <+scarman125> Weapon Teams
[1:59:22] <leaplearning> rats rats we are the rats
[1:59:23] <%ArceusStarDestroyer> Towers lots and lots of towers
[1:59:24] <%strakillias> Ratling Guns
[1:59:25] <+StromkoPenguin> Bring spears.
[1:59:26] <%thbluewarden> spears and weapon teams
[1:59:26] <Yomamma1337> with guns and nukes
[1:59:27] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> GUN
[1:59:27] <huskarl_zap> better have their best units
[1:59:27] <RaidenRising> genocide yay
[1:59:28] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt use guns not infantry, rat infantry sux
[1:59:28] <Zombrocom> Guns. Lots and lots of GUNS.
[1:59:29] <+Macmo696> Gun
[1:59:29] <kulmoth> gun them down
[1:59:30] <kazadaz> GUNS GUNS GUNS
[1:59:31] <+SimplyRandy> You want guns & spells targeting big enemies
[1:59:31] <kazadog> @PatStaresAt superior firepower
[1:59:32] <Treasure_Vault> Energy weapons?
[1:59:33] <dds333a> 47 billion dead rats
[1:59:33] <AmusingMantis> WARPSTONE NUKES
[1:59:34] <+RealThiele> towers put in work
[1:59:34] <kulmoth> they won't even reach you
[1:59:35] <%notsoy> they have guns and monsters
[1:59:36] <%ArceusStarDestroyer> Tier 3 Skaven towers are lighting beams
[1:59:36] <%Evan2Echoes> Ratling Gunners, Warplock Jezzails, Flamers
[1:59:36] <+Solutha> tech unit
[1:59:37] <+rafaelba93> with GUNS
[1:59:37] <dds333a> I am rat man
[1:59:38] <+SimplyRandy> bigger the ogre, bigger the target
[1:59:39] <%whyskeywolfe> Skaven get a nuclear bomb. use that.
[1:59:39] <%AncelDeLambert> anyone able to do unit value calculations in their head? What's the relative unit cost for these armies?
[1:59:40] <Soginha> focus fire on them
[1:59:43] <+Dradugun> More Dakka
[1:59:43] <%TheAdMerlin> Ratling guns solve a lot of problems
[1:59:44] <%Monkeyweed21> tarpit the ogres with trash rats while ranged units shoot them up
[1:59:44] <+thickshield> with better rats... nightrunners are way more dangerous then they look
[1:59:45] <%SashaStarshine> also nukes
[1:59:45] <%Valdorick> Even without weapon teams, 1 damage from a skaven slinger is a lot.
[1:59:46] <%Evan2Echoes> and a nuke
[1:59:48] <JackalKing> Skaven have tons of weapons teams, artillery, and magic. Their infantry is literally just cannon fodder to hold the enemy in place
[1:59:49] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt ratling guns
[1:59:52] <%Valdorick> when you have 4000 of them
[1:59:54] <+Local16> Just drop a rat nuke on em
[1:59:55] <HeroToxiko> slap a coat of orange on and tell em your weapons are corrosive acid
[1:59:57] <%Brassnarwhal> artillery freaks, excellent
[1:59:58] <+lordericter> 3 rattling guns will pretty much kill any stack of large units in the game
[1:59:58] <%Chex868> also while u take that city with your 20 stack they have 3 more 20 tsacks attacking your other city
[2:00:00] <AmusingMantis> NUKE THEM
[2:00:01] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> Skavens won WH 2 for a reason, and that reason is GUN
[2:00:11] <%Brassnarwhal> that rat nussy
[2:00:19] <%Valdorick> Remember that only Ikit has nukes
[2:00:20] <%notsoy> because that's what the previous owners had
[2:00:21] <HeroToxiko> WAAAAARG
[2:00:25] <leaplearning> russy
[2:00:26] <%ArceusStarDestroyer> Rats had an army building there
[2:00:26] <kazadaz> The skaven built a barracks, and it converted into your barracks
[2:00:27] <%strakillias> The skaven probs had their equivalent
[2:00:30] <%Valdorick> You convert the owner's buildings is why.
[2:00:31] <%Brassnarwhal> madness
[2:00:32] <%ArceusStarDestroyer> So you inhearited it
[2:00:32] <dundore77> that was an ogre faction settlement thats what they built
[2:00:32] <Onamar> skaven benefit from stacking buildings
[2:00:34] <huskarl_zap> it's the basic military building it changes to yours on capture
[2:00:39] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt everyone goes for basic recruitment on their first settlement
[2:00:40] <%notsoy> the AI will almost always build a basic troop building first
[2:00:41] <Zombrocom> Because the AI had a unit recruitment building, and taking it converts it to yours
[2:00:42] <%Valdorick> Well they don't get to recruit YOUR barracks building
[2:00:44] <%Undenizen> @JustTheGuyYouNeed what itteration is WH on now?
[2:00:46] <%Valdorick> so of coruse they built their own
[2:00:51] <AmusingMantis> @Valdorick Thats why you only play Ikit
[2:00:53] <aeravon> building stacks are big for skaven
[2:00:55] <%legendfather_of_giants> everyne needs the military building
[2:01:01] <kazadog> dual wepaon bulls
[2:01:03] <%ArceusStarDestroyer> Start running North to complete the Ivory road
[2:01:05] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt build defences on your base. it takes up a slot, but do you want 3 slots or do you want 2 slots and defences to keep the village
[2:01:11] <%legendfather_of_giants> @Valdorick and throt
[2:01:15] <%Valdorick> @Valdorick God Damn right!
[2:01:16] <%strakillias> Anit-Infantry
[2:01:18] <kazadaz> Yeah you'll need 2-3 turns to recover
[2:01:24] <dundore77> duel weapon bulls will be best rats are low armor cept their late tier units
[2:01:34] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt build ranged units
[2:01:43] <%tusk102> cuz towers keep destroying you
[2:01:51] <%Felhad> Ironguts rule
[2:01:56] <kazadog> the dual weapon bulls that died in that battle were the ones with the most kills
[2:01:57] <%notsoy> ogres don't get missiles or artillery until way later though
[2:01:59] <%Felhad> wait no
[2:02:03] <%Felhad> Leadbelchers
[2:02:03] <%OG_M_Bison> Do Ogres have artillery?
[2:02:12] <%Valdorick> And the ultimate nuke - snikch's faction deleter.
[2:02:15] <kazadog> @OG_M_Bison some of the best
[2:02:17] <%legendfather_of_giants> his personal line is good
[2:02:21] <%MooseIsGoose> Do ogres have any magic
[2:02:22] <Zombrocom> Ogres have the best artillary
[2:02:23] <kazadaz> Ogres get godlike artillery, basically a Stug
[2:02:25] <%notsoy> don't spend points on the hero action things (assault/assassinate) unless they are dedicated field agents
[2:02:32] <%legendfather_of_giants> no, with independent mind
[2:02:36] <kazadog> @MooseIsGoose yes on butchers and slaughtermasters
[2:02:48] <%notsoy> independent mind, because it unlocks everything else
[2:02:48] <%OG_M_Bison> The artillery is probs a good thing to build just for the towers I'd imagine
[2:02:49] <%strakillias> Go up the fighting line for now\
[2:02:50] <dundore77> @PatStaresAt the first settlement. you can build the gold building chain instead of the normal income chain
[2:02:51] <Zombrocom> I would go for armour buffs personally
[2:02:51] <+poisin224> assassinate is incredibly useful
[2:02:56] <%Valdorick> Unlock his skill tree; independent mind
[2:03:06] <+Rygaklu> vanguard is pretty good
[2:03:10] <%Monkeyweed21> just buff him in battle
[2:03:17] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt you can build a gold mine at the greasus settlement
[2:03:26] <%strakillias> Second row for unique skills
[2:03:36] <%Monkeyweed21> always do unique skills
[2:03:43] <kazadog> go drakestealer and open up that unique line for greasus until you decide a unit comp
[2:03:44] <+RealThiele> beast riders are cool lookin
[2:03:48] <%Undenizen> I'm suddenly imagining a scenario where skaven have nukes, but rather than use them they stockpile them for a cold war and peruse a cultural victory
[2:03:52] <%KineticZen> LUL
[2:04:01] <%notsoy> they have no settlements so this is a desperation attack
[2:04:06] <%MooseIsGoose> Why they fight you
[2:04:06] <Zombrocom> That rat wants REVENGE pat
[2:04:08] <%KineticZen> Thanks for your offering to the Maw rat man
[2:04:08] <%strakillias> You took his last settlement so he went for the hopeless battle
[2:04:10] <aeravon> he's back for more
[2:04:10] <Yomamma1337> theyre just suiciding into you since you stole their shit
[2:04:11] <%tusk102> LMAO
[2:04:13] <%notsoy> the AI does this a lot when one of their armies gets away but you took their last settlement
[2:04:15] <%Undenizen> hey do you like rats, pat?
[2:04:23] <MrNoobMcSalt> and yet, here they are
[2:04:31] <%Monkeyweed21> oh sick its a dwarf settlement
[2:04:32] <darkodargon> just let noblars handel it
[2:04:36] <+p4ntless> dying factions will usually suicide into you
[2:04:43] <%OG_M_Bison> LUL

[2:04:45] <%OG_M_Bison> OH Paige
[2:04:50] <Zombrocom> With no settlements, their army takes massive attrition every turn, so they have to seize a city or die

[2:05:47] <+RealThiele> towers just hit from wherever friggin snipers
[2:05:48] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt towers are one less slot for significant enemy stopping power
[2:05:53] <darkodargon> maybe if we can try to get a wizard
[2:05:55] <%chance_h> @MooseIsGoose idk but they're about to go meet him
[2:05:57] <%Valdorick> Wipe his army and then run away from him. Let the towers kill their lord
[2:06:00] <kazadaz> Those are the bravest rats I've ever seen
[2:06:09] <cartakus> Hey I got to see a stream!

[2:06:59] <+RDMtheAaron> HOW MANY TIMES DO WE HAVE TO TECH YOU THIS LESSON OLD MAN
[2:07:00] <Zombrocom> That is a sad rat

[2:07:00] <kazadaz> It's fucking insane how tough that rat is
[2:07:01] <+RealThiele> yea let the towers do the work
[2:07:03] <RaidenRising> poor rats man
[2:07:06] <%BinaryFireball> heroes are always like this
[2:07:13] <%BinaryFireball> its hilarious
[2:07:15] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt assassin rats can dodge a bunch, also only so many units can hit at one time
[2:07:29] <bearablepuns> *shakes gut* YOU'RE SAD NOW
[2:07:30] <%Brassnarwhal> it's from all the ogre nuts in his face it's demoralizing him
[2:07:33] <%PMMeObama> PMMeObama subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! Handing you the Bezos dollars, thanks for talking into my ears for like 8 years

[2:07:57] <%tusk102> LMAO
[2:07:58] <%MooseIsGoose> lol
[2:08:05] <Yomamma1337> this is why you kill the lord instead of letting him run away

[2:08:16] <%tusk102> lmao even

[2:08:24] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[2:08:26] <Zombrocom> This seems mean
[2:08:27] <%notsoy> no biggie
[2:08:35] <%Monkeyweed21> rats are suprisingly high in protein
[2:08:38] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt I wanna play this, Pat hook me up with a early copy with all your shilling powers
[2:08:39] <Gelphaze> Your dinner is getting away Pat!
[2:08:39] <%Undenizen> it's like... one guy?
[2:08:42] <kazadaz> Scalpose is the most heroic rat who ever lived
[2:08:42] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt only so many units can hit at once so if y ou swarm he has chance to run away
[2:08:44] <+izanagi22> Are we the baddies?
[2:08:51] <%legendfather_of_giants> WELCOME TO SKAVEN
[2:08:58] <dundore77> lol he has stalk so you have to find him
[2:08:58] <%notsoy> (when an army in Force March gets attacked, their whole army completely if they lose)
[2:09:01] <Zombrocom> 1 rat versus the ogre kingdoms
[2:09:01] <%tusk102> left
[2:09:03] <%MooseIsGoose> Find em
[2:09:04] <+UltraViolet371> it'll be super embarrassing if you lose
[2:09:08] <zerointelligence000> he's the biggest rat who makes all of the rules
[2:09:09] <%Undenizen> it's one guy.
[2:09:10] <Zombrocom> 1 single ninja
[2:09:13] <$SGrim> Always a nice battle when you have to ask where the enemy is. LUL
[2:09:14] <%Brassnarwhal> @monkeyweed21 weird how meat which is made of protein is high in protein psaLiz
[2:09:21] <Yomamma1337> hit him with a couple big guys
[2:09:25] <%legendfather_of_giants> dont swarm him with everything, just like half
[2:09:27] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> send the lords
[2:09:27] <+RealThiele> auto resolve would stop him
[2:09:28] <%MooseIsGoose> Who wins 1000 big boys or 1 small rat
[2:09:28] <dundore77> if he runs hes still dead you attacked while hes in force march
[2:09:28] <Zombrocom> Just put your characters and like one ironguts on em
[2:09:29] <%strakillias> He was in forced march so he'll die no matter what
[2:09:30] <kazadaz> The mammoth can prolly solo him
[2:09:32] <kazadog> @PatStaresAt when the victory screen hits set speed to fastest and let your guys kill him while he runs
[2:09:33] <%chance_h> SWARM!
[2:09:37] <Manwad> rotate ogre charges maybe?
[2:09:58] <zerointelligence000> honestly this is probably the bravest a Skaven has ever been
[2:10:05] <$SGrim> Literal *BONK*
[2:10:09] <cartakus> Gonna be a chaos boy stream?
[2:10:21] <%Undenizen> i feel like i'm watching the protagonist of some other movie at the end of act 2
[2:10:21] <Zombrocom> He's in march so he can't retreat anyway, he's fucked
[2:10:24] <+KingpinLarry> "fight back!"
[2:10:26] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Rest In Pieces One Guy

[2:12:20] <%Undenizen> oh my god
[2:12:22] <%tusk102> everytime he gets up you knock him back down
[2:12:26] <kazadog> poor little rat boy
[2:12:31] <%spitelite> i like the concept of an entire army being deployed to kill one rat
[2:12:38] <kazadaz> Pissing the night away....
[2:12:40] <%baka_sugoi> BULLY HIM
[2:12:49] <%Undenizen> this is the closest thing you could do to kicking a puppy
