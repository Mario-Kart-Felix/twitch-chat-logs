[0:27:56] <+CookieCutter007> it's George Washington
[0:27:57] <LycheeMusings> Macdonald
[0:27:59] <%snow_bush> PIerre Frenchbread
[0:28:00] <%thbluewarden> macdonald
[0:28:00] <%hotcarl6872> does it matter?
[0:28:00] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> could be Lincoln

[0:28:06] <%ShinobiPhoenix> most Americans fail the US Citizenship test
[0:28:08] <%KishinGrek> it's my favorite subject

[0:28:09] <%asgard147> You? limesThink
[0:28:10] <RoboticRexkek> I just know Justin Trudeau and his blackface
[0:28:11] <ArkSeaside> coming over from Woolie's chat for a second to ask the important questions: what ethnicity is BBQ Sauce

[0:28:13] <Zebroneath> Anthem's officially canceled!
[0:28:13] <%Jeemukun> I think it's Wilfrid Laurier?
[0:28:13] <Tracazoid> As a fellow Canadian, I would too. Fuck if I know the order of our Prime Ministers, also it was Macdonald but beyond that I have no clue who came after.
[0:28:13] <Aristotlay> Probably lincoln
[0:28:15] <UncleOliver> if it's macdonald paige has it aced
[0:28:15] <%KishinGrek> that and Pathology
[0:28:16] <%samTUMZlettuce> It was Google

[0:31:26] <jamox1> The fact that there‚Äôs so little muso makes me not want to play
[0:31:26] <revoltingimp> That's Musou alright
[0:31:30] <RoboticRexkek> I've probably battle for less than hour and I'm 6-7 hrs in LUL
[0:31:31] <+Dova573> IS THE TRUTH
[0:31:33] <Blank9> musou = dynasty warriors
[0:31:36] <%Divryne> P5 Strikers is the character action game of the Persona franchise.
[0:31:38] <$RealThiele> musou is warriors series
[0:31:41] <%BoxNavy> yeah

[0:33:16] <%BoxNavy> moon2SH
[0:33:16] <ThirdWelles> @TheCallousKing It's a direct sequel that uses Musou combat instead of JRPG turn-based
[0:33:17] <Blank9> Legit, Yakuza Team could do a Raidou game. Yakuza Ishin is so close to one with the weapon fusion system and setting.

[0:57:16] <%SomersaultJustice> PARLEY
[0:57:17] <+king_of_beggars> It's a really really bad storyline. I have MANY problems with it, as a writer.

[0:57:54] <%Razputin217> Yakuza Theme of Sad plays
[0:57:55] <+king_of_beggars> The fact that they give Lyse a princess storyline even though her dad wasn't a king, he was just some asshole.
[0:57:57] <%BoxNavy> and then they became a viera
[0:57:57] <2DSuperiority> so good they had to do it twice
[0:57:58] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Akechi be all like "Waaah muh trauma" and Im all like "I don't care"
[0:57:59] <%LeiaSkynoober> TRUE
[0:58:03] <problemagic> war criminal IN my terrible childhood
[0:58:04] <%SomersaultJustice> azim steppe?
[0:58:04] <drawerinkshow> Pekora is my favorite war criminal
[0:58:05] <%jaggstar2020> fish people
[0:58:08] <+abrupt_abe> Azim Steppe?
[0:58:08] <%LeiaSkynoober> I LOVE THE WAR CRIMINAL LADY
[0:58:10] <+Catpurnicus> the worse your childhood, the cooler you are and the worse crimes you can have forgiven
[0:58:12] <2DSuperiority> Namazu
[0:58:13] <$RealThiele> turtle power
[0:58:13] <DevinMayCry> I mean, look at the Weapon storyline. "Help me get revenge on big pieces of shit and then you can kill me as you are justified to do"
[0:58:22] <problemagic> war crimes child abuse speedrun
[0:58:22] <Chaossheep> which one was it
[0:58:27] <Chaossheep> oh yeah
[0:58:30] <%BoxNavy> yeah
[0:58:30] <%KineticZen> Natsuko Ishikawa, AKA "unhack our writing please lady"
[0:58:32] <+projectmanatees> nazamu
[0:58:32] <Chaossheep> azim steppe is fuckin' pogg
[0:58:33] <heartlesshealer> Is it that writer lady?
[0:58:36] <%curiour> "little sun"
[0:58:40] <%BigCoffee> Gotta dunk on The Sun
[0:58:41] <$RealThiele> little sun LUL
[0:58:42] <%Quigsies> Yup
[0:58:45] <enkaisu> Azim Steppe is one of my favorite locations in the game because i associate with the good story stuff
[0:58:46] <%DappercatEsquire> Stormbringers feels at once rushed and dragged out
[0:58:47] <Burger_Bonanza> I barely remember any details from anything other than the Azim Steppe. Characters and broad strokes, but no details.
[0:58:49] <%cvp5127> pat when do i start paying attention to the msq dialogue
[0:58:51] <heartlesshealer> yay
[0:58:53] <DevinMayCry> I thought it was 2 people
[0:58:54] <%LeiaSkynoober> Oh yeah, Natsuko! I‚Äôve heard great things about he, she‚Äôs great
[0:58:54] <%BoxNavy> yeah but you have to tank to see it moon2W
[0:58:55] <%BigCoffee> Petit Soleil
[0:58:56] <problemagic> don't like batman games
[0:59:00] <+king_of_beggars> Warrior is better.
[0:59:06] <Daniel_Is_I> Azim Steppes is great for Magnai and Sadu alone.
[0:59:06] <%BestTeaMaker> i don't think they had you sympathize with her situation. Sure she had a rough childhood, but the game doesn't absolve her of all her crimes. She's still treated as a war criminal.
[0:59:07] <%samTUMZlettuce> Lil' Sun
[0:59:07] <%caramelatte1> No just lead write the expansion from now on
[0:59:08] <+king_of_beggars> It turns into a stupid romance anime storyline.
[0:59:09] <%Pukenasty> nice, i'm on that section of the msq
[0:59:14] <DevinMayCry> Warrior got a good story
[0:59:18] <%BoxNavy> YEAH THATS FINE
[0:59:21] <enkaisu> plus the Steppe has Namazu so
[0:59:23] <%BoxNavy> HES PERFECT FOR THAT SETTING
[0:59:31] <$RealThiele> at least Yoshi P recognized talent
[0:59:33] <LorcaNomad> great even
[0:59:37] <StarMechV> The guy behind Heavensward is writing 16!?!?!...ok I'm okay with thi
[0:59:37] <Daniel_Is_I> Just give the entire FF series to Creative Business Unit 3
[0:59:38] <%BoxNavy> :)
[0:59:40] <%LeiaSkynoober> Haven‚Äôt done all of Dark Knight yet, but the start is so so strong
[0:59:44] <%justcallmebobplease> Has pat said what he thinks about how 16 looks, combat-wise?
[0:59:47] <problemagic> can i have your old one?
[0:59:48] <KidKaiser23> Wow, jus as I‚Äôm listening to Pod talk about this game, glad to see it‚Äôs all good
[0:59:54] <Aydarkzero> monkaS

[1:00:04] <+Veraverse> Yo, Anthem officially died
[1:00:05] <problemagic> its a long drive from louisiana but i'll pick it up
[1:00:06] <%MugenSandan> damn what kind of insane story would we get if Ishikawa plus Mr. Heavensward tag teamed
[1:00:09] <%BigCoffee> You probably have a warranty anyway right?
[1:00:15] <%KineticZen> Screensavers like it's 1994 again
[1:00:18] <%BoxNavy> you can get wallpaper engine as well
[1:00:20] <LorcaNomad> anthem dead btw
[1:00:20] <$RealThiele> was anthem ever truly alive?
[1:00:25] <problemagic> F
[1:00:30] <NeonBleu> the thing made to save screens?
[1:00:32] <+Catpurnicus> I liked the aquarium screensaver
[1:00:33] <+king_of_beggars> The display units in stores have burn in because they cut power with a breaker at night, which keeps the OLEDs from doing compensation cycles that help with burn in.
[1:00:37] <%SomersaultJustice> it's nice that you got a free wife with your new TV
[1:00:41] <Brandon__Brando> I used to use the TV as a monitor but got sick of all the problems it made
[1:00:43] <DevinMayCry> Persona 5 Strikers is weirdly okay on Switch BTW. Like its shockingly running alright compared to say, Age of Calamity which I loved but rougher
[1:00:45] <+SparrowHW> shoutout to the candycane pipe screensaver on windows xp
[1:00:50] <%BoxNavy> :O
[1:00:51] <+Catpurnicus> but everyone else seemed to just use Pipes

[1:01:21] <Lunalios> reel guud
[1:01:24] <%Ipsenscastle> are you back in then?
[1:01:26] <Sotetsu> Persona 5 Scramble sounds like a delicious breakfast dish
[1:01:26] <problemagic> can it SAVE fighting game?
[1:01:29] <DevinMayCry> Games have to have fishing to be a good game. GG Strive has fishing
[1:01:29] <%ChubbyPencil> I finally tried Potemkin on the last day after spending the whole beta with Nagoriyuki and HOLY SHIT Potemkin has everything

[1:41:06] <%asgard147> neat
[1:41:08] <+SparrowHW> did they re record the persona names?
[1:41:16] <%cvp5127> is that a free cast
[1:41:16] <heartlesshealer> Action Game Raido? <3
[1:41:17] <Daniel_Is_I> Except for Haru. Haru's is XXY for element.
[1:41:19] <BlacSoul> but not that specifically
[1:41:26] <%gitgouda> stylin
[1:41:28] <Daniel_Is_I> Yes it's a free cast
[1:41:35] <%DappercatEsquire> they all got guns
[1:41:37] <heartlesshealer> Silkie is Dormina
[1:41:39] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> this game would really benefit from a combo list
[1:41:44] <+OhioNitsud> niiice
[1:41:45] <Daniel_Is_I> Also health consumed by health skills regenerates if you don't get hit.
[1:41:46] <revoltingimp> XXY, XXXY, XXXXXY
[1:41:47] <%wembleyttv> They don't spend SP doing the combo button
[1:41:48] <+AlphaRayAllen> Grey life tho
[1:41:50] <%wembleyttv> WHICH IS GREAT
[1:41:56] <Aydarkzero> nice
[1:41:56] <quietshun> It has a combo list in the config menu
[1:41:58] <%viewtifulr> wait status is a thing here, wild
[1:41:59] <Saltmeisterr> COOL
[1:42:01] <%nicoleymcquack> This gives me kh combo vibes
[1:42:02] <Mildly_Eccentric> love that
[1:42:06] <Blank9> joker's joker like in p5, but the other party members are better than they were in p5 here
[1:42:08] <heartlesshealer> cast from grey life...
[1:42:10] <Demon_chann> cum
[1:42:17] <+thechungiestofbois> Yusuke is super fun
[1:42:21] <blastazoid00> I could see the next persona being like this
[1:42:24] <$MinoMiushi> What are the odds Pat and I are using the exact same party lmao
[1:42:27] <Daniel_Is_I> Yusuke is a crit god
[1:42:28] <@SSaryn> @patstaresat I should mention, Jokers Showtime attack is going to be that Personas element but counts as Almighty damage. If the enemy is weak to said element, just does more damage, if the enemy isn't weak to it, just counts as Almighty.

[1:48:52] <+AlphaRayAllen> FREE RAKUNDA IS SICK
[1:49:00] <%DarkNerdShawny> @itsgundamu the same way it does in the og game for persona attacks
[1:49:04] <%Arancet> @problemagic not gonna lie, sitll a bit weak, similar to other musous
[1:49:04] <%Burdenslo> Clacker volley!
[1:49:07] <+icekept> whats her affinity?
[1:49:09] <%shootbang_exe> also her moves all have a question mark
[1:49:13] <blastazoid00> CUBE
[1:49:15] <pipboy344> What is Sophia‚Äôs phantom thief name?
[1:49:17] <+NickHatesSnow> what about futaba
[1:49:20] <blastazoid00> Her Cubesona
[1:49:29] <%Arancet> futaba doesnt fight
[1:49:30] <%DarkNerdShawny> @cafefunk no but there are times you have to defend her while she's hacking
[1:49:31] <Daniel_Is_I> Futaba is a support, can't play as her
[1:49:31] <+cafefunk> is Akechi not playable?
[1:49:37] <%Agami23> is her persona pandora?
[1:49:37] <+SunnyVarietyPack> Sophie is the phantom thief name
[1:49:37] <dohrge> Futaba‚Äôs still not playable lol
[1:49:39] <+itsgundamu> @DarkNerdShawny So are there Persona spells you can use mid battle? Like do you pause then use them?
[1:49:40] <Daniel_Is_I> @pipboy344 Sophie.
[1:49:40] <+jjolion> Also how would you compare this to Age of Calamity?
[1:49:41] <OneThousandTomatoes> futaba has something else
[1:49:42] <problemagic> @Arancet Thanks. Guess I'll stick around to actual gameplay and see.
[1:49:44] <%ringabal> Our Persona toaster is now a DoorDash app.
[1:49:45] <%viewtifulr> Kill Akechi again
[1:49:46] <Saltmeisterr> Akechi died bro
[1:49:48] <+AlphaRayAllen> Also Sophia is fucking CUTE
[1:50:00] <%cvp5127> luck?
[1:50:00] <BlacSoul> is this after OG or Royale?
[1:50:00] <+SunnyVarietyPack> Alec hi isn‚Äôt playable, this takes place months after persona 5
[1:50:03] <%viewtifulr> good
[1:50:06] <Coconosuga> ‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°
[1:50:07] <+cafefunk> oh so this is post p5
[1:50:07] <%DarkNerdShawny> @itsgundamu yes, its kinda like FF7R where battle pauses
[1:50:10] <dohrge> Akechi is ‚Äú‚Äù‚Äùdead‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù
[1:50:10] <itsANDYLUL> HACKERMANS
[1:50:11] <%GalacticaPhanto> @cafefunk I mean considering this takes place after P5 vanilla. I mean....
[1:50:16] <jcflyguy> Hacking Battles so good
[1:50:18] <pipboy344> @cafefunk He‚Äôs in rehab
[1:50:20] <%Agami23> @cafefunk its a sequel
[1:50:24] <DevinMayCry> This is a sequel to 5. Royals non canon
[1:50:30] <revoltingimp> """"""""""""""""dead"""""""""""""
[1:50:32] <pipboy344> @galacticaphanto No, Royal content is mentioned several times
[1:50:34] <%moogleboy1984> Is this the console version, or PC?
[1:50:35] <+cafefunk> ok I didnt know if this was after the post canon
[1:50:36] <%JohnAtDawn> @BlacSoul Do you see Sumire anywhere?
[1:50:39] <BlacSoul> coolio
[1:50:40] <+SunnyVarietyPack> Tbf this doesn‚Äôt contradict Royal at all
[1:50:40] <problemagic> oh shit that rules
[1:50:44] <pipboy344> @devinmaycry No they reference it
[1:50:48] <+rbakervv> @BlacSoul OG, it came out around same time as royal, so couldn't use any of its stuff
[1:50:48] <OneThousandTomatoes> I think it doesn't contradict royal
[1:50:51] <%BestTeaMaker> this is basically teetering on the border of character action and musou
[1:50:51] <%Ranryu692> @DevinMayCry Royal is canon, this was just made at the same time so it doesn't have Kasumi
[1:50:55] <+SunnyVarietyPack> Sumire isn‚Äôt a phantom thief
[1:50:55] <heartlesshealer> What's the name of Sophia's persona?
[1:50:57] <+AlphaRayAllen> This is the least musou musou game I've ever seen, its like a real game
[1:51:01] <Paciboyy> the Music is dope
[1:51:05] <%DarkNerdShawny> @moogleboy1984 PC
[1:51:06] <MrMagicConch> Congrats on the engagement pat!
[1:51:12] <Lunalios> wait really?
[1:51:16] <%sporeian94> Remember folks it's CANONICAL that Sae is an adult virgin
[1:51:17] <Xelgus> I had to rebind dodge to circle, I genuinely couldn't handle it being on RT
[1:51:18] <%wibbwobbler> I'm definitely not cannon
[1:51:21] <%BoxNavy> good
[1:51:24] <DevinMayCry> Kasumi has 0 reason not to be in evben with that explanation then
[1:51:26] <Lunalios> even after royal's real ending?
[1:51:29] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Purple's busy doing her gymnastics shit
[1:51:30] <thetruenicster> But you can tell it was made while/before Royal was in development
[1:51:31] <OneThousandTomatoes> its the best musou because its the least musou musou
[1:51:33] <%BestTeaMaker> can you still go out with kawakami
[1:51:38] <%moogleboy1984> @DarkNerdShawny Thanks, I wanted to check out how it ran on PC, so this'll inform my decision
[1:51:40] <Blank9> there's no time management, but the events and stuff are still basically there
[1:51:41] <%JohnAtDawn> YOU CAN CHOOSE?!
[1:51:51] <Daniel_Is_I> The worst part is you only learn moves for the character you're playing, so if you max Joker's moves, you don't want to play him because that's wasted move XP.
[1:51:51] <%rumtumtugnutz> can you bang ryuji
[1:51:52] <OneThousandTomatoes> sophies shop's menu is great
[1:51:52] <+projectmanatees> @devinmaycry no she does
[1:51:53] <+SunnyVarietyPack> Kasumi is not a phantom theif
[1:51:54] <+AlphaRayAllen> YEP
[1:51:56] <revoltingimp> Bondmaker MOST IMPORTANT
[1:51:57] <%JohnAtDawn> YEYEYEYEYEYEYE
[1:51:57] <+SunnyVarietyPack> She said so
[1:51:58] <%DarkNerdShawny> @bestteamaker shes at home chilling, its the summer time
[1:51:59] <%Ranryu692> @DevinMayCry She wasn't a completed character while they were making this game
[1:52:00] <@SoFarFetched> I thought that said Bitcoin
[1:52:00] <+cafefunk> so how long is this game? certainly not as long as og p5
[1:52:01] <problemagic> oh wow
[1:52:01] <%cvp5127> all of them?
[1:52:01] <%debugdrawray_> WAW
[1:52:03] <+Rofiarf> its way more limited but still cool
[1:52:03] <+szysi3k> the what?
[1:52:04] <+ThomasOfTroy> Okay, but does Becky let you smash?
[1:52:04] <%GalacticaPhanto> Oh Lovenza whaaaaa
[1:52:05] <%ringabal> THERE SHE IS LADS
[1:52:05] <clumsydemiurge> yes but is mara in
[1:52:10] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Yaaaay Lavenza
[1:52:11] <Coconosuga> Bond, Persona Bond.
[1:52:12] <+itsgundamu> I heard its streamlined for creating personas?
[1:52:12] <+Doombarr> time to fuse Lu Bu
[1:52:12] <%rumtumtugnutz> BANG RYUJI
[1:52:12] <revoltingimp> It is heavily stunted from the usual games
[1:52:16] <lbrownthedestroyer> Persona 5 II confirmed!
[1:52:16] <%KineticZen> I still hate the English voices, is there dual audio
[1:52:17] <drawerinkshow> Wow I was specting we oly get Arsene
[1:52:17] <heartlesshealer> The girls are Lovenza again yay
[1:52:18] <pricklypissant> Wait really?
[1:52:18] <ketchuo13> Koei makes great musou games that arent Dynasty or Samurai warriors
[1:52:19] <+megaman_sentinel> make Alice
[1:52:21] <BlacSoul> @JohnAtDawn Considering i know NOTHING about Scramble, i wont rule out characters being non accessible , dont be rude
[1:52:21] <heartlesshealer> no loli
[1:52:22] <+Deekman> are the skills random?
[1:52:22] <Huntercd> Satanael?
[1:52:23] <pipboy344> Royal IS canon. Kasumi is mentioned and Morgana directly references the true ending of Royal
[1:52:23] <Draco_Renegade> So does recruiting personas work like in Raidou or is it still negotiation?
[1:52:24] <BoSteed> Didn't expect her
[1:52:25] <revoltingimp> Mara is in as a late game persona
[1:52:25] <%sporeian94> MAKOTO IN THIS GAME IS DOUBLE CHEEKED UP
[1:52:26] <%asgard147> This really is a sequel limesPoggers
[1:52:26] <$debugdrawray_> so its BASICALLY P5 with a different combat system
[1:52:26] <%DarkNerdShawny> @moogleboy1984 im running on pc. runs great! looks amazing in 4k
[1:52:27] <%Agami23> i hope beelzebub is in the game.
[1:52:32] <%Agami23> love my bug boy
[1:52:32] <problemagic> oh WOW it REALLY is the Reverse Yakuza 7
[1:52:36] <xerioes> get them big mara combos
[1:52:38] <+Movemeister> Mara top tier
[1:52:40] <%Arancet> @Draco_Renegade theyre drops here
[1:52:42] <+king_of_beggars> This guy's LN is so bad.
[1:52:51] <LycheeMusings> Would you want KT to make Raidou 3
[1:52:52] <%BoxNavy> boy is it not
[1:52:52] <pipboy344> LAVENZA!
[1:52:54] <drawerinkshow> Nope
[1:52:55] <%JoshManVGH> Huuuuuh.
[1:52:55] <+AlphaRayAllen> Where are the bases and commanders?
[1:52:56] <%BestTeaMaker> this is just a persona map
[1:53:03] <+chaumiester> How does it play then?
[1:53:06] <+cafefunk> wait if this is post p5 then why is Joker here, he went home at the end of p5
[1:53:07] <+AlphaRayAllen> Where are my retreating allies?
[1:53:10] <drawerinkshow> They must have changed stuff mid development
[1:53:12] <TheWashoutXY> More persona 5 is always good
[1:53:13] <problemagic> go to square press attack for 3 minutes
[1:53:16] <+projectmanatees> Also it saves personas in the book if you don‚Äôt have enough space
[1:53:16] <%JoshManVGH> I really gotta finish P5R...
[1:53:18] <%charp35> Honestly thank god it's not capture the rooms like normal muso
[1:53:19] <revoltingimp> this is the most perfect blend of genres
[1:53:22] <%Arancet> @cafefunk visiting for the summer
[1:53:22] <Blank9> KT could absolutely make Raidou 3, they were a big part of making Fire Emblem Three Houses too
[1:53:23] <Xelgus> @cafefunk summer vacation
[1:53:25] <+SunnyVarietyPack> He came back for summer
[1:53:27] <%arcielardor> This is more like Raidou Kuzunoa
[1:53:29] <%Ranryu692> @cafefunk Why was Yu in P4A? They came back to visit
[1:53:30] <OneThousandTomatoes> @cafefunk they're got together to go on a road trip
[1:53:31] <%GarbageQueenEllie> This looks really neat.
[1:53:36] <pipboy344> @chaumiester It is LITERALLY Persona 5 with real time combat.
[1:53:41] <+cafefunk> ahhhhh ok
[1:53:44] <%Burdenslo> Do you have to have joker in your party?
[1:53:49] <%Deft_Thought> I've been stupidly waiting for a PC port of P5 for a while now. As much as I wanna scoop this game because it looks fun as hell, I can't justify getting it without having beaten P5
[1:53:52] <+SunnyVarietyPack> This whole game takes place place the following summer
[1:53:55] <%JohnAtDawn> Oh so Yakuza
[1:53:57] <%DarkNerdShawny> @burdenslo yes
[1:54:08] <+chaumiester> Wow.... this was not what I was expecting..... This looks... Good
[1:54:13] <%BestTeaMaker> THIS IS LITERALLY REVERSE YAKUZA
[1:54:13] <%Movemeister> This game is basically how the fights are in the anime
[1:54:13] <%Ranryu692> @Deft_Thought you're gonna be waiting a long time
[1:54:13] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Smooth
[1:54:14] <pipboy344> @ranryu692 and he came back previously for the canon Dancing game
[1:54:15] <%DarkNerdShawny> @deft_thought watch a YouTube playthrough lol
[1:54:15] <+Deekman> they did a reverse Yakuza
[1:54:16] <%JoshManVGH> HUUUUUUUUH....
[1:54:16] <%Burdenslo> @darknerdshawny damn I wanted to run the all girls squad
[1:54:17] <+cafefunk> didnt they destroy the metaverse at the end of p5?
[1:54:19] <problemagic> wow
[1:54:20] <+AlphaRayAllen> It'
[1:54:20] <SirCacaPee> Im into it
[1:54:23] <drawerinkshow> The early trailers lied SUPER HARD
[1:54:25] <+AlphaRayAllen> It's the good game instead
[1:54:27] <ChungusQuest> It's as much a musou game as Hades
[1:54:28] <%BestTeaMaker> YAKUZA PLAYS LIKE PERSONA, AND PERSONA PLAYS LIKE YAKUZA NOW
[1:54:29] <+ThomasOfTroy> Is there a time limit on holding summon or is it infinite?
[1:54:29] <+twohitgood> that's great to hear. i might actually get it.
[1:54:30] <%JoshManVGH> Holy shit.
[1:54:31] <heartlesshealer> neat
[1:54:31] <tattleworm> it's weird how all the best musou games are barely musou games
[1:54:32] <DevinMayCry> You guys know Omega Force adds in new characters to these games real quick right? Like it had to have been a choice for them not to include he. Whats baffling is its got horendous DLC and no additional content unlike a lot of other Musous got (but thats not entirely unlikely for series just for these series adaptations)
[1:54:32] <+OhioNitsud> can you continue combos from baton passes?
[1:54:33] <%cvp5127> good
[1:54:34] <+SunnyVarietyPack> Meta verse returns via new app
[1:54:36] <3Xgilly> ok now im on board
[1:54:39] <%Arancet> @cafefunk they thought, why its here is a mystery
[1:54:41] <%DarkNerdShawny> @burdenslo nope, just make Joker a pimp lol
[1:54:49] <%JoshManVGH> whaaaaaat!
[1:54:53] <%Deft_Thought> @DarkNerdShawny I know the whole story. I watched most of A German Spy's playthrough.
[1:54:54] <+AlphaRayAllen> Passing in battle fills up your big musou meter faster
[1:54:56] <clumsydemiurge> @PatStaresAt how do you feel now about this over P5 Arena?
[1:54:57] <+twohitgood> i don't like musou games so that's good to hear.
[1:55:00] <%Jeemukun> someone said it eariler but it also reminds me of a Raidou game but better
[1:55:01] <Daniel_Is_I> I don't use baton passing as much as I should
[1:55:02] <%valriot> Harus BOOBA boing
[1:55:03] <%JoshManVGH> I am so happy!
[1:55:05] <%Deft_Thought> Still wanna go through it myself, yah know?
[1:55:06] <%DarkNerdShawny> @thomasoftroy infinite
[1:55:08] <%JohnAtDawn> What meter?
[1:55:10] <%BoxNavy> you are covering it
[1:55:10] <Saltmeisterr> what meter?
[1:55:11] <revoltingimp> Baton Pass functions to give you more Show Time energy for your BIG FUCKOFF MUSOU ATTACKS
[1:55:12] <%Agami23> the meter you are covering up???
[1:55:18] <%rumtumtugnutz> do your potemkin buster
[1:55:21] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Cant see meter
[1:55:25] <%JohnAtDawn> LUL
[1:55:27] <%GarbageQueenEllie> This is really effin smooth
[1:55:27] <pipboy344> @clumsydemiurge Probably better since this is really Persona 5-2 than the fighting games

[1:56:22] <Lunalios> you think p6'll be more like this?
[1:56:23] <Xelgus> they traded genres for a bit
[1:56:23] <%BoxNavy> pat is in there
[1:56:26] <OneThousandTomatoes> amd the story is just more p5 goodness
[1:56:26] <drawerinkshow> Sadly is not availible for Win 7
[1:56:28] <%JoshManVGH> Well this just went to the top of my game priority list
[1:56:30] <%DarkNerdShawny> @deft_thought GIVE ME MONEY!
[1:56:34] <%Alazull> @PatStaresAt So instead of a dancing game as a direct sequel we got a musou for P5?
[1:56:36] <+AlphaRayAllen> What difficulty are you on?
[1:56:37] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Phantom thieves must get ORN
[1:56:40] <%GarbageQueenEllie> *ORB
[1:56:40] <+allups> u reacting to the state of play?
[1:56:41] <+KaijuUltimax> It apparently has a huge difficulty spike
[1:56:41] <Daniel_Is_I> The first boss is ACTUALLY hard
[1:56:41] <+SunnyVarietyPack> Nah this is a one time deal
[1:56:42] <rei0> pat you're not saving? that's surprising
[1:57:03] <%rumtumtugnutz> ....whaaaat the fuck is Sophia??
[1:57:13] <%Deft_Thought> @DarkNerdShawny Nah, I gotta spend it on P5 Scramble LUL
[1:57:16] <%viewtifulr> I still gotta finaish Yak7 but I just ended up grinding levels and burnt out
[1:57:20] <+AlphaRayAllen> She's a waifu
[1:57:22] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> the SP disappears very quickly in this game
[1:57:23] <%BoxNavy> no
[1:57:23] <rcand9> this menu is sick
[1:57:24] <+king_of_beggars> You should've made Curry, dude.
[1:57:26] <%BestTeaMaker> @PatStaresAt what's the canonicity of Persona 5 Dancing
[1:57:30] <quietshun> Jus leave and come back tho
[1:57:30] <problemagic> 50% bigger!
[1:57:32] <%DarkNerdShawny> @alazull the P5 dancing game was an in-between story
[1:57:37] <%Arancet> @rumtumtugnutz an AI that manifests as a robot in the metaverse. why? gonna have to find out
[1:57:39] <Saltmeisterr> HAHA GAMER
[1:57:41] <%ringabal> Boy, that fireaxe just keeps going places
[1:57:46] <heartlesshealer> does the weapon change appearance?
[1:57:52] <DevinMayCry> Im da Jokah baby

[1:58:24] <%rumtumtugnutz> Hey, it's Ewsuke!
[1:58:29] <+SparrowHW> almost all the dialogue is voiced, such a huge difference from the main game
[1:58:31] <problemagic> i was thinking about hotdogs
[1:58:33] <revoltingimp> the dog turned into a man on a horse!
[1:58:34] <%DarkNerdShawny> @bestteamaker p3d and p5d are dreams
[1:58:37] <heartlesshealer> that's a lot of high pixies
[1:58:42] <%asgard147> SourPls
[1:58:47] <thetruenicster> Yeah, Yusuke is very useful in this Dungeon

[1:59:32] <revoltingimp> did you get the music pack, Pat?
[1:59:40] <Blank9> There's some dungeon music on par with Wheel of Fate
[1:59:46] <Zerotoad5> @BoxNavy Its been okay load times are a bit long
[1:59:51] <%Alazull> Because copyrights
[1:59:52] <%Aeoneth> Damnit I want this game but no want spend money
[1:59:52] <%DappercatEsquire> @PatStaresAt you try those sparky blue fuckers and get your shit pushed in?
[1:59:53] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Persona characters when your lvl 99 character oneshots the boss: "We BARELY made it!"
[1:59:54] <acexclover> i see why pats havinv a rough time
[1:59:58] <Saltmeisterr> DOMADOMADOMA
[2:00:01] <DevinMayCry> Smash Bros Save Data gives you something on switch.
[2:00:05] <problemagic> Guess i'll have to actually FINISH P5 now
[2:00:07] <DonCrow> How much voiced lines the game has?
[2:00:08] <clumsydemiurge> @PatStaresAt Doma's weak to poison Kappa
[2:00:09] <%Arancet> oh this is a yakuza story too
[2:00:22] <revoltingimp> awww, busting it out to Mass Destruction and the P4 themes rocks
[2:00:24] <%viewtifulr> Domo kaschu?
[2:00:26] <problemagic> it literally makes the switch heavier
[2:00:29] <%goose_attack_almanac> Fearsome Four is a very Yakuza thing to say. Usually it's tied to a minigame htough
[2:00:30] <+king_of_beggars> This is more real game than any Musou has ever been.
[2:00:30] <3Xgilly> oh jesus
[2:00:31] <%BoxNavy> WE'LL KILL YOU
[2:00:37] <+OhioNitsud> okay, I'm getting this after yakuza 7
[2:00:37] <rcand9> nice

[2:00:39] <%Treuan> Road trippin
[2:00:40] <+AlphaRayAllen> Using their smartphones
[2:00:40] <Xelgus> PC version is kinda iffy if you ask me. ~6 hours in and it crashed to desktop
[2:00:47] <%Daxalog> uh oh
[2:00:53] <%Alazull> "You're trying to stop me doing weird shit in the cognitive world? I'LL KILL YOU!"
[2:00:55] <clumsydemiurge> hee
[2:00:56] <%BoxNavy> SourPls
[2:00:59] <+ThomasOfTroy> So it's set directly after the final cutscene of P5?
[2:01:00] <%maskofmichael> So for doing the same thing the heroes were doing before?
[2:01:02] <ChungusQuest> he is a pumpkin now
[2:01:04] <Daniel_Is_I> This game has god-tier music
[2:01:04] <%asgard147> SourPls
[2:01:12] <+AlphaRayAllen> Keeper of Lust is always a bop
[2:01:18] <%GarbageQueenEllie> You gotta pump 2 years' worth of asswhoopin' into Doma ove here
[2:01:23] <%BoxNavy> yes
[2:01:27] <%JohnAtDawn> Yeah musou stuff
[2:01:29] <DevinMayCry> The shields are like Pirate Warriors 4
[2:01:35] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[2:01:38] <drawerinkshow> LUL
[2:01:43] <Daniel_Is_I> At least the game doesn't end if Joker dies
[2:01:44] <moonmeh> at least it aint game over
[2:01:44] <+RowenCleric> jokers dead and its not a game over!?
[2:01:45] <+CookieCutter007> monkaS bayo difficulty
[2:01:45] <%valriot> Man if only BOSSES IN FUCKING P5 HAD THAT SYSTEM, rather than being boring gimmicks or just nothing
[2:01:49] <SirCacaPee> good ass song
[2:01:49] <%Aeoneth> Well at least Joker death doesn't immediately result in game over
[2:01:50] <%BoxNavy> i dont even like persona and im thinking about getting this
[2:01:50] <Zerotoad5> Remember to change persona and absorb attacks
[2:01:51] <LorcaNomad> oh this remaster tho SourPls
[2:01:52] <%Jeemukun> oh good, you don't lose when joker dies
[2:01:53] <+eldrinos> oh hey the AI bothers to heal you. *looks over at Donald Duck*
[2:01:53] <%Alazull> @PatStaresAt No lie dude watching this...I kinda hope they use it as a basis for future games?
[2:01:53] <%asgard147> monkaS
[2:01:54] <rcand9> If you are listening atlus PORT P3 FES to STEAM
[2:01:55] <%viewtifulr> Oh wow that did damage
[2:01:56] <problemagic> damn we USED TO LIVE in a society
[2:01:57] <Dr_Mooose> SourPls
[2:01:57] <+szysi3k> that's a huge contrast in battles difficulties
[2:01:58] <revoltingimp> lol, eat shit joker
[2:02:18] <%DappercatEsquire> I really wish this game let you pull the camera out a bit more
[2:02:19] <HarmlessCrow> I see the music still slaps
[2:02:19] <revoltingimp> This game would be fucking impossible if joker wasn't allowed to die
[2:02:24] <+AlphaRayAllen> Camera goes a little nutty sometimes though
[2:02:27] <%GarbageQueenEllie> I've got a feeling that P6 onwards is gonna start playing more like this
[2:02:29] <Blank9> Best song in this game's one called Singularity.
[2:02:33] <%JohnAtDawn> Is most of the battle dialogue recycled?
[2:02:34] <+king_of_beggars> Silkie has Ice
[2:02:45] <heartlesshealer> Silkie
[2:02:45] <Xelgus> the first jail was a nightmare to stay healed in. no items, no money, no sp, it sucked
[2:02:45] <+SunnyVarietyPack> I really don‚Äôt think it will
[2:02:49] <DevinMayCry> SP is super sparce earlyon
[2:02:50] <heartlesshealer> aww sp
[2:02:56] <drawerinkshow> omg this is so chaotic
[2:02:59] <+itsgundamu> god I can barely tell whats happening
[2:02:59] <Blank9> I'd be totally fine if SMTV went action-y.
[2:03:07] <heartlesshealer> rip sp
[2:03:08] <BackflipCharm> This seems REALLY busy. I hope it's easier to follow when you're in control
[2:03:24] <problemagic> you DO it!
[2:03:26] <%Arancet> which is had the 2s art end
[2:03:28] <%Arancet> wish*
[2:03:36] <clumsydemiurge> I'd rather they keep SMTV the same and just make more Raidou games
[2:03:40] <+chaumiester> How is this game suppose to run on the Switch? This game looks like it would burn the Switch out
[2:03:41] <+SunnyVarietyPack> It‚Äôs really good! But I think the series that kind of brought turn based back is going to stay turn based
[2:03:43] <moonmeh> man this runs smooth
[2:03:44] <%Treuan> The fearsome four\
[2:03:47] <+AlphaRayAllen> LUL She's right
[2:03:50] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> audio mixing seems a bit shaky
[2:03:55] <problemagic> threatening three more like
[2:03:56] <+KaijuUltimax> Blergh
[2:03:57] <Saltmeisterr> BLERFG
[2:04:00] <%AtlasMcCoy> Blergh!
[2:04:02] <HarmlessCrow> You fools, I'm the HUGEST LOSER OF THE SQUAD. THE DESIGNATED JOBBER
[2:04:04] <problemagic> a lifetime bitch
[2:04:07] <%emperordread> ORB
[2:04:08] <rcand9> they put work into this
[2:04:08] <nilla_24> orb
[2:04:14] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> For Real
[2:04:15] <+kerotuyu> Did they just kill a man?
[2:04:18] <DevinMayCry> We gotta find the third strongest mole
[2:04:18] <%wibbwobbler> I'm actually super weak lol!
[2:04:19] <%Alazull> @PatStaresAt Well you sold at least one copy of this game
[2:04:20] <%ringabal> Oh god, am I reading Rave Master again?
[2:04:27] <revoltingimp> Like most good action games, there are points where you really enter a flow state and just blast through combats, and it's the coolest shit.
[2:04:29] <%Daxalog> "Explore Jail"
[2:04:32] <%BoxNavy> O
[2:04:35] <%viewtifulr> the fearsome four gets revied by the big bad before the main fight like megman I bet Kappa
[2:04:39] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Hmm, looks like a TV
[2:04:40] <rcand9> this is so much better than another Q game
[2:04:41] <problemagic> damn pat you look kind of cool!
[2:04:41] <heartlesshealer> yeah, haru needs to sleep
[2:04:41] <%Treuan> I wish just hitting the checkpoints healed and refilled SP, instead of having to leave and come back
[2:04:41] <SirCacaPee> God I miss yusukes stupid dialogue
[2:04:42] <%BoxNavy> SourPls
[2:04:46] <clumsydemiurge> this is cool and all but when is joker in fortnite
[2:04:52] <+chaumiester> PC make sense as to why it runs so well. But honestly, how does this run on the Switch? With frame drops?
[2:04:54] <%kyh9> P5 Scramble is honestly more interesting than P5 Royal
[2:04:55] <+AlphaRayAllen> Japan probably
[2:04:55] <%asgard147> SourPls
[2:04:57] <%kyh9> It's lilke a beach town

[2:06:45] <%chiazam> What the Fuck
[2:06:49] <%kyh9> This is a better follow up to P5 than Royal, honestly
[2:06:50] <%Jeemukun> oh cool Sendai
[2:06:53] <problemagic> way heavier on the persona than the musou
[2:07:02] <+CookieCutter007> FeelsBadMan Yusuke still poor

[2:07:26] <+SunnyVarietyPack> Yes
[2:07:27] <DevinMayCry> @kyh9 I guess they do reference Royal but its small or negligble, that said its just a new adventure for the main game post 5
[2:07:28] <tattleworm> this looks a lot more fleshed out than aot2's out of battle stuff
[2:07:33] <+thechungiestofbois> @heartlesshealer the game takes place over summer, so time progression isn't like the original game
[2:07:36] <revoltingimp> it is literally a sequel, they tease it in the ads for the game
[2:07:38] <problemagic> not a spinoff at all!
[2:07:38] <DonCrow> Why do they still have powers?
[2:07:40] <%SWFanatic> You Suck eyyyyyy
[2:07:40] <+CookieCutter007> Persona 5-2
[2:07:43] <@SoFarFetched> gyutan is delicious
[2:07:46] <+Dragon4234> @PatStaresAt How do you feel about how each different persona changes Joker's strong attack enders
[2:07:51] <+chaumiester> WTF, this sequel is awesome compared to the dancing sequel of P4
[2:07:53] <Blank9> this is a way better sequel game than P3FES's The Answer, or P4 Arena's story
[2:07:56] <@SoFarFetched> beef tongue = gyutan
[2:07:56] <clumsydemiurge> metaverse haunted
[2:07:57] <%Arancet> i legit teared up a bit when i started this game and walked into leblanc with beneath the mask playing
[2:07:58] <%StrawberryPantsu> Arena and dancing are sequels
[2:08:02] <problemagic> okay i'm definitely getting this. thanks for showing it off pat
[2:08:06] <revoltingimp> buy all the fucking food you can, best way to save SP honestly
[2:08:07] <DevinMayCry> To be fair 5 got dancing sequel too
[2:08:07] <%kyh9> @rcand9 Yeah but I felt like the new stuff in P5 Royal should have been the premise of a new game rather than an add-on to P5.  Like the premise was REALLY different in Royal's third semester
[2:08:12] <@SoFarFetched> but the Beef Tongue is in thin slices for Gyutan
[2:08:12] <clumsydemiurge> persona Q is a sequel Kappa
[2:08:13] <Draco_Renegade> I wish we got a P4 member as a party member.
[2:08:16] <%ÏΩîÏΩîÍæ∏Îùº> @PatStaresAt Gyutan is beef tongue
[2:08:18] <rcand9> will we ever get a p4 scramble?
[2:08:20] <1matheuw> @clumsydemiurge metaverse is what?
[2:08:25] <devanmuse> I have to say, "Writer brainwashing people to buy their shitty books" doesn't seem like much of a villain compared to the P5 villains
[2:08:31] <DevinMayCry> Q is a midquel isnt it
[2:08:38] <KidKaiser23> Where is my wife Makoto?
[2:08:40] <+LordSDB> Okay now I am a bit curious, sequel to Base 5? Or does that include 5Royal as well?
[2:08:40] <%RyderTokage> So that's what you're getting
[2:08:41] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> how's money gain?
[2:08:42] <problemagic> Q isn't real
[2:08:44] <%GalacticaPhanto> Beef tongue does sound fucking good rn not gonna lie
[2:08:45] <rcand9> q sucks ass
[2:08:51] <%chiazam> COOK
[2:08:51] <heartlesshealer> @thechungiestofbois That sounds really good for letting people get used to fighting and not have the game rush through on a fixed pace when retreating
[2:08:53] <+snickers_md> is pat playing on pc or console?
[2:08:56] <+Dragon4234> @devanmuse That's kinda the point
[2:08:59] <%GarbageQueenEllie> That'll do it
[2:09:03] <problemagic> Ahhhh
[2:09:03] <+king_of_beggars> Pixie's Square>Square>Triangle combo has a like 50% chance of casting Dia on you. I spammed it once to refill Joker's HP before a miniboss fight in the first dungeon.
[2:09:04] <%Agami23> like me with fate!
[2:09:05] <drawerinkshow> Nintendo fans?
[2:09:06] <+thechungiestofbois> They become Kpop Stans
[2:09:08] <+chaumiester> Oh... So Berserk Fans
[2:09:09] <+CookieCutter007> The s word
[2:09:10] <%ringabal> TIER 4 SUBS
[2:09:11] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[2:09:15] <heartlesshealer> it turns them into Idol fans
[2:09:15] <+SparrowHW> just like the real world then, huh
[2:09:17] <+szysi3k> oh, twitter mob
[2:09:18] <drawerinkshow> LUL
[2:09:18] <%viewtifulr> Vtubers?
[2:09:19] <Daniel_Is_I> Lots of assault happening in this game
[2:09:19] <%BoxNavy> KPOP STANS monkaS
[2:09:19] <SirCacaPee> So most fanbases tbh
[2:09:19] <%isolex_> TIER 4 SUBS
[2:09:20] <Paciboyy> I think it's cool that it's a smaller scale villain
[2:09:21] <%brickwall35> LUL
[2:09:24] <%kyh9> @DevinMayCry Yeah but that's why I like Strikers more.  The premise uses more of P5 itself as the basis for the story.  It's a good follow up where P5 Royal just feels like a deviation
[2:09:24] <RaidenRising> tier 3 subs ?
[2:09:24] <KidKaiser23> @lordsdb confirmed Sequel to 5, apparently mentions Royale but doesn‚Äôt reference the events
[2:09:26] <+Dragon4234> They attack people who even look like the characters
[2:09:27] <LycheeMusings> Should have had a K-Pop Shadow for the real social commentary
[2:09:32] <%kyh9> STAN ALICE
[2:09:33] <Ks201> Also beating people to near death for not liking it
[2:09:33] <BluBox> Tier 4 monkaS
[2:09:33] <%SWFanatic> Explore Horny Jail
[2:09:33] <%DianaTheAscian> Shocked theres no gacha villain @PatStaresAt
[2:09:33] <+KaijuUltimax> Inventing new tiers of subs just for brainwashing power
[2:09:34] <problemagic> lots of the crazy going around
[2:09:34] <@SoFarFetched> Thanks Eminem for Stan
[2:09:36] <%Aeoneth> So then a Tier 5 Sub is a legit cult member?
[2:09:36] <%BoxNavy> so this game isnt a work of fiction?
[2:09:38] <rcand9> PogChamp idol dungeon
[2:09:38] <%chiazam> Oh so just like people in real life
[2:09:39] <Tonicky > Isn't that just In the Mouth of Madness lol
[2:09:39] <+kyh9> STOP PLAYING P5 STRIKERS AND STAN ALICE
[2:09:40] <%goose_attack_almanac> When's the evil Vtuber
[2:09:40] <Bustahhwulf> yea not as malicious as robbing highschoolers LUL
[2:09:41] <1matheuw> does everyone have movesets?
[2:09:42] <%Burdenslo> I was gonna say potter stans
[2:09:45] <quietshun> Alice cute
[2:09:47] <+LordSDB> @KidKaiser23 Gotcha ty
[2:09:47] <%Daxalog> I do like the idea that other people out there got the same ability and just did their own stuff with it.
[2:09:47] <clumsydemiurge> @PatStaresAt did you see the dialogue with the guys outside of iwai's shop that actually uses "the word"
[2:09:49] <%brickwall35> Maki Itoh best girl
[2:09:49] <revoltingimp> The villains are also still raging assholes
[2:09:49] <whiteherox> is this the new game? how is it
[2:09:49] <%Broken_Sonex> Now THATS society
[2:09:49] <%Treuan> SP
[2:09:51] <rcand9> curry all day
[2:09:54] <%XeroSigmaPrime> OK I NEED THIS GAME NOW
[2:09:57] <$KnightAsteran> Royal can totally be canon to strikers, same thing hapened with Arena and Golden for P4 IIRC
[2:09:59] <+Dragon4234> @KidKaiser23 I'm pretty sure they off hand mention Royal exactly once
[2:10:00] <%kyh9> Also, this game has Zenkichi
[2:10:02] <problemagic> rk rowling is the second dungeon?
[2:10:04] <Huntercd> They need to get the cat off the table
[2:10:07] <$MinoMiushi> You get a BOND UP for the first time you make a recipe
[2:10:08] <%Artemis_Scowl> Artemis_Scowl subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months! Hey Pat, enjoy the game! This is honestly a MUCH better game than I thought it would be going in. Its for lack of a better phrase, filled with love.
[2:10:08] <rcand9> so do i have to re slink my team?
[2:10:09] <%SWFanatic> What a Fat Tuba
[2:10:09] <+mudkipz_v2> is this game definitely worth it
[2:10:10] <LorcaNomad> this game is fucking nuts
[2:10:10] <StormFourStrings> @patstaresat I‚Äôm getting anti smoking ads on your stream. Thank you for your concern, but my goal is actually to die at 30, and your efforts have only lead to me doubling up.
[2:10:11] <%XeroSigmaPrime> THIS GAME IS TOTALLY DIFFERENT THAN IT SEEMS
[2:10:11] <DevinMayCry> @kyh9 I prefer it that way too I just got corrected by lots of people when I claimed its not off of Royal cause I guess theres a small one early on
[2:10:11] <mighty_fine_trousers> Where's Sae?
[2:10:13] <LycheeMusings> EXPLORE JAIL
[2:10:15] <Daniel_Is_I> It's also kinda weird how the first 2 dungeons mirror the first 2 dungeons of P5, down to how Ann and Yusuke are the ones getting involved.
[2:10:18] <%viewtifulr> Joker figured out a new recpie
[2:10:20] <Saltmeisterr> so who is zenkichi?
[2:10:21] <cgreene64> Chat, what is strikers?
[2:10:21] <%GarbageQueenEllie> I love their little RV. it's so cute
[2:10:28] <DevinMayCry> I like how "than it seems
[2:10:30] <%DappercatEsquire> @PatStaresAt are you a fan of Zenkichi's straight man act?
[2:10:32] <Visorak6> So how did they get their powers back?
[2:10:39] <DevinMayCry> I like how "than it seems" as in "Ew musou"
[2:10:40] <KidKaiser23> Oh they Road Trip road trippin
[2:10:41] <rcand9> are the main teams Slinks maxed out from p5?
[2:10:44] <$KnightAsteran> Zenkichi is the best
[2:10:46] <$KnightAsteran> i love him
[2:10:47] <%natjen8> I kinda want a game like this for the other personas now
[2:10:52] <%kyh9> @DevinMayCry True, true
[2:10:58] <+Dragon4234> @PatStaresAt You should focus on unlocking all the Master skills for each character since the AI uses them
[2:11:09] <Meekest> This just looks like P5 but in like, an everything way
[2:11:10] <%kyh9> @natjen8 I know, I'd like a mainline Persona 6 that's just using STrikers' gameplay
[2:11:24] <+thechungiestofbois> Zenkichi is the best "new character" to any persona game by leaps and bounds
[2:11:26] <KidKaiser23> @visorak6 The real power was in them all along
[2:11:29] <dohrge> Who tf does zenkichi remind me of?
[2:11:32] <%chiazam> Oh My God
[2:11:32] <%BoxNavy> yes
[2:11:34] <rcand9> yea
[2:11:34] <%kyh9> These guys do REAL damage
[2:11:38] <+KaijuUltimax> I call it "Playfighting"
[2:11:38] <%Arancet> yeah
[2:11:42] <%BoxNavy> :O
[2:11:42] <dohrge> Sounds like sojiro maybe
[2:11:49] <%Artemis_Scowl> yup. these guys are hitters tho
[2:11:49] <rcand9> good stuff
[2:11:49] <+eldrinos> i know it's fucking refreshing that they actually matter
[2:11:52] <revoltingimp> your party is so fucking instrumental to your success lol
[2:11:55] <%DappercatEsquire> first time I heard Zenkichi I thought it was Troy Baker
[2:12:01] <+king_of_beggars> HEALERS NEED TO DPS TOO
[2:12:02] <%kyh9> I'm surprised there's no split-screen multiplayer for this
[2:12:04] <+Rofiarf> naah i managed to defeat alice with only ann
[2:12:04] <+Dragon4234> @PatStaresAt Well maybe aside from Joker I've found
[2:12:08] <+CookieCutter007> Donald dying all the time
[2:12:12] <%wembleyttv> Depending
[2:12:16] <revoltingimp> having Sophie's AI spam Rakunda on bosses is soooooooo useful!
[2:12:20] <KidKaiser23> Makoto!!!
[2:12:23] <Woronov> False news boss moves are good telegraphed it will take a long time though
[2:12:24] <clumsydemiurge> you don't pay their subs
[2:12:24] <%PanicSwytch> Does the game explain if Mementos is different or changed?
[2:12:35] <KidKaiser23> Me and Goofy stepping over Donald‚Äôs deadass
[2:12:35] <1matheuw> what button is gun in this game?
[2:12:36] <%GarbageQueenEllie> God I love being able to see Johanna in action
[2:12:40] <%Treuan> Get the buffs!
[2:12:41] <rcand9> can makoto do donuts nonstop?
[2:12:42] <%wembleyttv> I just wish the was a restart button in certain fights
[2:12:44] <%Daxalog> yeah. those words.
[2:12:45] <%Agami23> heat riser must be nuts
[2:12:46] <%kyh9> It's cool Omega Force is actually trying way harder now.  Age of Calamity and P5 Strikers make me excited to see new Musou games
[2:12:47] <%Daxalog> They work
[2:12:48] <%wembleyttv> That's what annoys me
[2:12:48] <+SunnyVarietyPack> Mementos is gone
[2:12:50] <+Dragon4234> @PatStaresAt Even with all of Makoto's master unlocks I feel like she's the most underwhelming character to play as
[2:12:51] <clumsydemiurge> but marin fucking karin though
[2:12:51] <%chiazam> IS THIS MUSOU!?!?
[2:13:05] <+Partialrecall2> tacCBT
[2:13:06] <%Artemis_Scowl> and all the buffs are very good
[2:13:06] <%Movemeister> This game is straight stylin
[2:13:07] <DevinMayCry> @chiazam Yes
[2:13:10] <$KnightAsteran> just hit things
[2:13:11] <+SparrowHW> is Charge for one attack still?
[2:13:12] <Woronov> nah just use the char
[2:13:13] <%shootbang_exe> just use them
[2:13:15] <+Dragon4234> @PatStaresAt Nope just use 'em a lot
[2:13:16] <+thechungiestofbois> @PatStaresAt use the new combo move you learned
[2:13:16] <chaos2frozen> just using the character
[2:13:17] <%Arkfyre> just use the character
[2:13:18] <revoltingimp> Use the character
[2:13:19] <+Rofiarf> high combo and showtimes seem to work
[2:13:19] <jcflyguy> Just control the char
[2:13:20] <+mudkipz_v2> Should I play Royal or this game?
[2:13:23] <%Artemis_Scowl> nope, just use them
[2:13:26] <%wembleyttv> You got to do it like that
[2:13:27] <Blank9> Don't forget Koei Tecmo also did a ton of work for Fire Emblem Three Houses. They're really varying up.
[2:13:28] <%wembleyttv> Sorry
[2:13:34] <1matheuw> ONE YEAR ALL CRIMES
[2:13:38] <Woronov> i had them all in the middle of the third jail
[2:13:44] <$KnightAsteran> This game wont spoil Royal for you if you want to play it
[2:13:53] <DevinMayCry> @mudkipz_v2 You definitely want to play this after Persona 5. Either royal or vanilla. If you havent played either dont play this yet
[2:13:56] <+KaijuUltimax> @mudkipz_v2 Both if you can afford it
[2:13:56] <+Dragon4234> @mudkipz_v2 I mean it depends on what you own and if you've already played P5
[2:13:57] <%SWFanatic> Is this a Dark Souls?
[2:13:57] <%GarbageQueenEllie> As she SHOULD
[2:13:58] <+thechungiestofbois> Haru is so strong
[2:13:58] <whiteherox> so this is dynasty warriors persona??
[2:14:01] <clumsydemiurge> the psi tornado is so goddamn broken
[2:14:02] <%wembleyttv> You just need to play the base game of Persona 5
[2:14:03] <%SWFanatic> Is this Anor Londo?
[2:14:03] <%DappercatEsquire> Haru says ACAB
[2:14:04] <drawerinkshow> This is really cool I gotta play it for miself now
[2:14:04] <%cvp5127> as she should be
[2:14:06] <$KnightAsteran> Haru also has some of the best lines in the game
[2:14:08] <%goose_attack_almanac> I love Haru
[2:14:09] <%ringabal> She chops firewood to destress
[2:14:09] <+CookieCutter007> She's just built different
[2:14:10] <rcand9> haru looks sick with the grenade launcher in an action game
[2:14:13] <problemagic> had to go watch the baby take his first steps what did I miss is this some sort of megadungeon?
[2:14:17] <Blank9> haru's the raincoat killer
[2:14:17] <KidKaiser23> She blew up those cars?
[2:14:18] <+thechungiestofbois> Haru says ACAB
[2:14:18] <%chiazam> oh my god
[2:14:23] <%Movemeister> Yoooo
[2:14:31] <Daniel_Is_I> I'm surprised you didn't go for the lockpicking one immediately
[2:14:32] <KidKaiser23> @thechungiestofbois What a Queen
[2:14:36] <rcand9> do we finally get sufficient haru?
[2:14:52] <+Dragon4234> @PatStaresAt How awesome is it to just level up Personas in the Velvet Room?
[2:14:54] <%Daxalog> How does it raise?
[2:14:55] <huskarl_zap> rich girls are always daddy issues
[2:14:55] <$KnightAsteran> @rcand9 she gets some of the best lines in the game so yes
[2:14:58] <%SWFanatic> spin 2 win
[2:15:02] <+thechungiestofbois> @rcand9 Haru gets a whole story arc
[2:15:02] <Woronov> at around 80 the enemies keep respawning under 10% they dont
[2:15:02] <%Agami23> you get better rewards for higher security??
[2:15:03] <DirgeNovak> This is closer to Persona 5-II than Persona Warriors tbh
[2:15:07] <%shootbang_exe> have you run into a treasure/gem shadow yet?
[2:15:09] <rcand9> @KnightAsteran great
[2:15:09] <1matheuw> is the framerate of the game chigging
[2:15:12] <Daniel_Is_I> Haru "ACAB" Okumura.
[2:15:15] <FelixQuinnNoir> this the pc version? or ps4/ps5?
[2:15:16] <Zeif00> Is the story interesting? I've found other Persona "sequel" stories to be kinda weak and pointless.
[2:15:24] <1matheuw> chugging*
[2:15:26] <$KnightAsteran> "We just despise the police is all" haru says to a police officer, while smiling
[2:15:27] <rcand9> @thechungiestofbois oh sick
[2:15:34] <%Artemis_Scowl> @rcand9 yes, Haru gets screentime finally!
[2:15:37] <problemagic> blind
[2:15:38] <DevinMayCry> You mabufu
[2:15:44] <%KineticZen> M'bufu
[2:15:46] <clumsydemiurge> m'bufu
[2:15:49] <revoltingimp> YET
[2:15:49] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Joker be all liek "But Mabufu"
[2:15:55] <%MisterRockett> HAHAHA
[2:15:55] <%Arancet> costs no sp in combo either
[2:15:56] <problemagic> same
[2:15:57] <%Artemis_Scowl> YUP
[2:15:58] <%ringabal> New Game Plus Joker is CANON
[2:15:59] <KidKaiser23> I love that Haru, the Psychic User, got a fuckin grenade launcher and a skull crusher hammer
[2:16:01] <%SWFanatic> Mah Bufu *Tips Hat*
[2:16:02] <%kyh9> THIS GAME LOOKS SO GOOD
[2:16:15] <nilla_24> you can level up the personas in the compendium
[2:16:19] <%kyh9> CAN WE JUST GET PERSONA 6 WITH THIS GAMEPLAY PLEASE
[2:16:20] <+Deekman> that's a little overwhelming
[2:16:21] <revoltingimp> they are significantly weaker than hard casts tho
[2:16:30] <heartlesshealer> so combo king in this game for sp saving
[2:16:30] <%Daxalog> Does ammo still work the same?
[2:16:32] <%MisterRockett> @KidKaiser23 Dumb meatheads with psychic abilities are my favorite.
[2:16:36] <+Dragon4234> @PatStaresAt The spells used in a combo scale off the highest tier unlocked spell for all the characters, Joker's Personas are set no matter what for balance
[2:16:37] <clumsydemiurge> they're weak to gun, just like me
[2:16:45] <+SunnyVarietyPack> Recharges after every fight
[2:16:49] <$KnightAsteran> my main gripe with this game is there are some gaps in the persona elemental coverage at later levels
[2:16:51] <revoltingimp> same with buffs in combos, they last only a fraction of the length as hardcasts
[2:16:53] <%Arkfyre> you get your ammo back after each battle
[2:16:54] <Style_train_14> wait so scramble is an action game?
[2:16:55] <%Alazull> Music is banging
[2:16:57] <+Dragon4234> @Daxalog It works off Royal rules so a full reload per battle
[2:17:10] <rcand9> how dank?
[2:17:17] <%GarbageQueenEllie> What if P6 is just a genre hopping nightmare. Like one genre per palace
[2:17:17] <mighty_fine_trousers> Certainly looks  like a musou
[2:17:20] <+pkdragoon> @patstaresat whos ur favorite to use
[2:17:25] <DevinMayCry> @Style_train_14 Yeah its got a lot of the original dungeon crawling stuff but battles are action encounters and time will stop for some moves like spells
[2:17:25] <$KnightAsteran> yup
[2:17:26] <Woronov> yes
[2:17:32] <mighty_fine_trousers> Naotora Ii?
[2:17:32] <revoltingimp> yes
[2:17:46] <DevinMayCry> No SP use
[2:17:48] <+Dragon4234> @PatStaresAt Like when Anna unlocks Matarunda it replaces her Tarunda combo
[2:17:56] <Blank9> you'll just get strong later
[2:17:59] <+SparrowHW> will joker cast tier 2 and 3 spells in his combo chain?
[2:18:01] <%wibbwobbler> psaGib
[2:18:03] <%SWFanatic> Turn into a helicopter you snarky cat
[2:18:14] <Daniel_Is_I> I love Morgana's cartoon jump noise
[2:18:18] <+Dragon4234> @SparrowHW Depends on the persona itself
[2:18:18] <+king_of_beggars> Pixies weak to gun.
[2:18:19] <%KishinGrek> hey did everyone see the game concept of 'ILL'?
[2:18:22] <clumsydemiurge> you mean "high pixies" Kappa
[2:18:26] <Lionkevinson> Is there Japanese audio for this game?
[2:18:50] <%Puhff> maaan, I really wanna play p5 but it just feels so intimidating
[2:18:52] <revoltingimp> there's also very little reason to keep non ma- versions of abilities, since the ma- only costs 2 sp more lol
[2:18:56] <Daniel_Is_I> Makoto is really strong after you get her master arts
[2:18:57] <%GarbageQueenEllie> You should just run over everything with Johanna like a driveby
[2:19:01] <problemagic> nah this is hotsnow
[2:19:01] <DevinMayCry> The option says "Japanese Audio" and says YES and NO as selection for it lol
[2:19:05] <OmniSTylez> what is this persona deadly premonition game?
[2:19:07] <+ThomasOfTroy> What are the attack type icons under the move prompts?

[2:22:47] <acexclover> yea
[2:22:49] <+noajenkk> this legitimately looks better than persona 5 and idk how to feel about that
[2:22:49] <%Broken_Sonex> @clumsydemiurge Didn't he like....stop doing that in P5? I thought he got over it.
[2:22:49] <%shootbang_exe> you haven't unlocked it yey
[2:22:50] <s1rcuit> fuck I'm late
[2:22:50] <jcflyguy> Yes
[2:22:50] <%maenos2> so like persona 3 where the midfloor bosses were SO much harder than the full moon ones
[2:22:52] <Daniel_Is_I> @PatStaresAt The one in the first dungeon is harder than the SECOND dungeon boss
[2:22:52] <%shootbang_exe> yet
[2:22:54] <%wembleyttv> You CAN NOT beat them 1st time
[2:22:57] <soflicar> spoiler but yes

[2:23:13] <+projectmanatees> They have god hand
[2:23:18] <acexclover> i agreee with those shadows with electricity iflts horrible
[2:23:19] <%SWFanatic> lol
[2:23:20] <%wembleyttv> I got shafted by Bugs thinking it will be easy 1st time
[2:23:21] <ItsJustThatSimp_le> beyond recognition
[2:23:21] <%wembleyttv> NOPE
[2:23:23] <%valriot> Its endgame Persona, like getting errr, Alice and stuff i believe
[2:23:26] <+Dragon4234> Yeah Bugs is tough
[2:23:26] <%Puhff> bodied
[2:23:28] <revoltingimp> i am sure you can beat them from the beginning, but it would literally take an hour or something, with the amount of health they have
[2:23:29] <+projectmanatees> Yes
[2:23:30] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt sorry I'm late, how's the game so far?
[2:23:32] <%DappercatEsquire> those blue guys will step into your ass, spray paint it, and leave snickers wrappers on the ground
[2:23:34] <Louie_Salmon> When they kiss pat's ass gets greased, super beast, super beast
[2:23:34] <+Dragon4234> She said the thing
[2:23:36] <mighty_fine_trousers> so do not pursue lu bu?
[2:23:38] <clumsydemiurge> @Broken_Sonex maybe, but in this game there are literal sidequests dedicated to morgana doing fetchquests to make ann like him
[2:23:41] <%BoxNavy> nookalur
[2:23:47] <Daniel_Is_I> Yeah the dire shadows are meant to be endgame/postgame
[2:23:53] <Blank9> this truly was the Persona 5 Scramble
[2:23:57] <revoltingimp> newclear
[2:23:58] <+Dragon4234> @PatStaresAt How nice is it level up personas in the Velvet Room
[2:24:03] <problemagic> love a good beam
[2:24:08] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @clumsydemiurge Can you fail them on purpose? I wanna see Simpgana cry
[2:24:15] <LycheeMusings> Sophie is just a better Aegis
[2:24:16] <Daniel_Is_I> Arsene learns skills up to level 95
[2:24:27] <%Broken_Sonex> @clumsydemiurge That's weird that they wouldn't carry over any character development.
[2:24:27] <%SWFanatic> is it worth getting the deluxe version?
[2:24:27] <s1rcuit> The Velvet Persona room
[2:24:39] <zachpaladin> CONGRATS ON THE PROPOSAL!
[2:24:41] <revoltingimp> fuck levelling him up to that point tho. That shit get's stooopid expensive lol
[2:24:42] <AMask777> whats nice is that it lets you buy personas for transfusion without having to go back through 2 menus

[2:26:47] <%Treuan> Dog
[2:26:56] <s1rcuit> was it this or Persona 5 R that people couldn't stream?
[2:27:01] <%Ipsenscastle> Big Dog
[2:27:03] <%BoxNavy> i like her funny + eyes
[2:27:04] <Saltmeisterr> @PatStaresAt they are from the future
[2:27:04] <serkiimouse> I knew those robots were evil
[2:27:05] <%Forente> that dog is a cop
[2:27:09] <revoltingimp> FIST OF JUSTICE
[2:27:11] <%Movemeister> Both
[2:27:12] <%Daxalog> Boston Dynamic is the future of security
[2:27:13] <silverira> @PatStaresAt Are you going to stream the playstation state of play tomorow?
[2:27:23] <%maenos2> ok i really dig sophia's mask thing
[2:27:24] <s1rcuit> They ARE Boston Dynamics, that's why Nuclear is an attribute
[2:27:24] <%maenos2> its cute
[2:27:28] <OneThousandTomatoes> @s1rcuit atlus won't let you stream endgame of this
[2:27:39] <+MaitrePielle> can the UI be edited? It looks kinda busy
[2:27:46] <+Dragon4234> @PatStaresAt Even with all her unlocks I still think Makoto is the most whelming character to play as
[2:27:48] <asdief_> Is the story good so far?
[2:27:50] <+tigerfang86> o r b
[2:27:54] <%BoxNavy> you are a orb...
[2:27:55] <%Ipsenscastle> ooooorb
[2:27:56] <tattleworm> TAKE YOUR ORB
[2:27:59] <%TheWinged7> blorb
[2:28:03] <DirgeNovak> you can remove the control guide
[2:28:07] <problemagic> why does that app  shake her butt like that
[2:28:09] <clumsydemiurge> *furious woolie typign noises*
[2:28:15] <zachpaladin> How does the mask stay on?
[2:28:16] <+MaitrePielle> that's something lol
[2:28:16] <Daniel_Is_I> I think Ann feels the worst to play as
[2:28:22] <s1rcuit> @OneThousandTomatoes that makes sense, that was their stance with P5, but wasn't there a big stink a while back about not being able to stream P5R at all?
[2:28:24] <Saltmeisterr> also ryuji says FUCK in this game
[2:28:26] <problemagic> glue
[2:28:35] <jcflyguy> Don't sleep on the Item Recovery skill, it basically doubles effectiveness at lv 2
[2:28:35] <OneThousandTomatoes> joker would also be theif
[2:28:36] <HarmlessCrow> If you say "I don't like Makoto" into a mirror three times, Woolie will appear behind you
[2:28:40] <mighty_fine_trousers> dq 3 reference?
[2:28:44] <%crimsong0ddess> crimsong0ddess subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months! Hey pat, hope all is well

[2:29:09] <%Movemeister> Bodied
[2:29:23] <s1rcuit> @TheWinged7 was about to say
[2:29:26] <heartlesshealer> just, nudge the slime
[2:29:30] <clumsydemiurge> crazy talk saved makoto
[2:29:31] <DirgeNovak> "I don't like Makoto"   ...   "Pat and Woolie are no longer friends"
[2:29:32] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> that's way cooler
[2:29:36] <%Broken_Sonex> @HarmlessCrow I don't like Makoto, I don't like Makoto, I don't like Makoto.
[2:29:38] <kingmemelord97> i thought p5 was turn based ?
[2:29:40] <jesuchanplays> WHO THE FUCK IS THAT
[2:29:48] <%GarbageQueenEllie> "I don't like playing as Makoto-- oh hey look an upgrade"
[2:29:58] <+MaitrePielle> lucatiel
[2:29:59] <%Ipsenscastle> this really isn't very dynasty warriorsish at all huh
[2:30:00] <s1rcuit> I assume the girl in the hoodie is a Scrambles character that would make sense if I got here on time?
[2:30:01] <Blank9> makoto and mona can sit out
[2:30:08] <Blank9> everyone else is great though
[2:30:15] <%weissguard> ye
[2:30:17] <+thechungiestofbois> yes
[2:30:18] <%BoxNavy> no

[2:30:25] <%BigCoffee> yes
[2:30:26] <heartlesshealer> yes

[2:30:41] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Futable
[2:30:43] <heartlesshealer> Pat, you missed "Thank the RNG gods!" earlier
[2:30:47] <problemagic> how does this run on switch
[2:30:50] <+cafefunk> So is this game co op or are the party members cpu
[2:30:50] <OneThousandTomatoes> this is futaba and yusuke's palace
[2:30:52] <%goose_attack_almanac> If you missed it Pat, Ann and Futaba were assigning Dragon Quest roles to people
[2:30:53] <%akaAxi0m> She was talking about Potemkin psaJpeg
[2:30:54] <problemagic> is it BAD?
[2:30:56] <%MisterRockett> This is gonna be where Futaba yelling out video game mechanical references is ACTUALLY gonna get way more meta,
[2:31:02] <%TIME_PUNCHER> this game kinda reminds me of Catherine
[2:31:05] <clumsydemiurge> FOR REAL?
[2:31:08] <%aishman> Hows the game so far @PatStaresAt ? Also dude I woke up today and went "Oh lets play some more GG-oh wait I can't" I've never played a fighting game so much as I did during the beta weekend.
[2:31:08] <%BoxNavy> any gamers in here? cake is a lie am i right?
[2:31:09] <Daniel_Is_I> It sucks getting all of Joker's first and then you have to avoid playing as him for 12 hours
[2:31:18] <heartlesshealer> oh man if it's that often
[2:31:21] <%valriot> FOR REAL?!
[2:31:22] <heartlesshealer> hmm
[2:31:22] <%SWFanatic> is that the soundtrack or zangief snoring?
[2:31:23] <revoltingimp> that's what we were saying lol
[2:31:25] <asdief_> Did pat ever beat royal off screen
[2:31:30] <rcand9> when does ryuji say FUCK

[2:31:45] <problemagic> this is a new game
[2:31:59] <OneThousandTomatoes> its like 30-50 hours long
[2:31:59] <Daniel_Is_I> Sukukaja also gives crit in this game
[2:32:02] <%TIME_PUNCHER> i don't sake, YOU sake
[2:32:02] <clumsydemiurge> ryuji says FOR REAL more in the first few chapters of this game than the entirety of P5
[2:32:04] <heartlesshealer> mash Y to increase judgement cut
[2:32:07] <+ExtremeQuads> yes yusuke very good
[2:32:07] <%chiazam> Ah so Pat belongs to the Ren Amamiya gang as well huh, nice
[2:32:12] <+Leeyonidas> im confused, what is this moaning in the background
[2:32:16] <heartlesshealer> that seems silly
[2:32:17] <s1rcuit> @asdief_ I assume so, since he loves persona, do you know if P5R has enough new content to justify getting it?
[2:32:24] <+tigerfang86> thats just a vergil
[2:32:26] <%Broken_Sonex> Still a simp Morgana? Cool, no one cares.
[2:32:27] <%Mrbaconator> gief sounds like a dying old man LUL
[2:32:28] <xxshadowxx416> judgement cut

[2:33:01] <%Mrbaconator> MOTIVATION UP
[2:33:01] <%Movemeister> Well then
[2:33:07] <DirgeNovak> Now are you motivated
[2:33:08] <+Leeyonidas> really does sound like a dying old man
[2:33:14] <heartlesshealer> @Leeyonidas yeah, Zangief is snoring on the other side of the couch
[2:33:20] <jesuchanplays> is that a new character or from royal??
[2:33:24] <Daniel_Is_I> You put a crit up accessory on Yusuke, have him pop Sukukaja, and he shreds guard
[2:33:25] <+mudkipz_v2> sophie sounds like pichu
[2:33:27] <+Leeyonidas> bless his sleep
[2:33:30] <%GarbageQueenEllie> So what's the name of Toaster Strudel's Persona?
[2:33:37] <DirgeNovak> Sophia is new from this
[2:33:38] <Daniel_Is_I> Sophia is new in P5S
[2:33:39] <%ringabal> "JOKER, MY STARVATION CONTINUES TO MOTIVATE ME!"
[2:33:53] <DirgeNovak> The Royal characters are not in this
[2:33:53] <s1rcuit> I assume we haven't seen her face yet?
[2:34:02] <Lunalios> there's two new ones in scramble that basically take the element slots that kasumi and akechi have
[2:34:08] <Blank9> nah they have
[2:34:09] <%TIME_PUNCHER> this is like the Yakuza 7 of DMC
[2:34:12] <xxshadowxx416> I may play and finish this persona
[2:34:33] <heartlesshealer> yeah, AI elemental attacks in this fighting style should be nice
[2:34:35] <Blank9> she hides her face as her battle outfit, like everyone else with their masks
[2:34:37] <OldManDeckardCain> man, sumi would be so fun to play as in this game...
[2:34:39] <asdief_> @s1rcuit 25ish hours of new content, but it really depends on if you're willing to replay persona 5. New month is some of the best content in the persona games tho
[2:34:42] <s1rcuit> @Lunalios is P5R worth getting if you played P5 standard?
[2:34:47] <clumsydemiurge> bufu deez nutz
[2:34:52] <%Ipsenscastle> boofoo
[2:34:58] <justinjtime> This game looks fun actually!
[2:34:59] <revoltingimp> no one takes Curse element except Joker
[2:35:04] <Daniel_Is_I> @s1rcuit If you mean Sophia's face, her face is only covered in her thief outfit. You see her face when you first meet her.
[2:35:05] <%Ipsenscastle> do not pursue bufu
[2:35:13] <lonosi55> Pat likes this game?
[2:35:14] <s1rcuit> @asdief_ bummer, can't justify that financially
[2:35:18] <Calamity2007> @revoltingimp What does the new guy have then?
[2:35:26] <revoltingimp> Almighty
[2:35:27] <heartlesshealer> Lovely Empty Bottle
[2:35:27] <Draco_Renegade> I wonder if someone will mod a vergil outfit for Yusuke
[2:35:37] <s1rcuit> @Daniel_Is_I thanks, I got here late
[2:35:37] <OneThousandTomatoes> what he do
[2:35:41] <rcand9> zangief a sleepy boy

[2:35:48] <asdief_> @s1rcuit That's fair, I hope you'll find it on a sale some day
[2:35:52] <%QueequegTheater> Gief do a big snore
[2:35:55] <+Dragon4234> @PatStaresAt Do you think how since you can leave at anytime, battles can be way more difficult then resource drains?
[2:35:59] <+netrac> The other new character has like all the mechanics from the other characters + a new one
[2:36:01] <%chiazam> HUH
[2:36:03] <%ringabal> Pulling her best Rita Repulsa

[2:36:49] <Yummy_Nukes> STEP ON ME ANTE
[2:36:50] <Draco_Renegade> How bad is it?
[2:36:55] <+king_of_beggars> There's only 3 of the 4 Heavenly Kings
[2:37:00] <%chiazam> @PatStaresAt Any returning adult characters other than Sojiro?
[2:37:01] <heartlesshealer> might as well just call them the fucking four heavenly kings

[2:37:11] <clumsydemiurge> üêç
[2:37:12] <Lunalios> Royal is a 2nd draft of p5 it does a lot to make the game more entertaining with showtimes, new personas and an entire new month of content. I finished in in 165 hrs tho so keep that in mind if ur willing to commit.
[2:37:13] <%QueequegTheater> GIANT SNAKE WOMAN
[2:37:13] <%Movemeister> Pretty original novel here

[2:37:44] <%chiazam> This Remix slaps
[2:37:47] <Louie_Salmon> Big anime OP energy
[2:37:55] <OneThousandTomatoes> @daxalog because there is actually too many of these for it to stand out at all, and also brainwashing
[2:37:56] <%Movemeister> This is the vod mute version
[2:38:01] <RaidenRising> nice remix
[2:38:02] <LycheeMusings> NEVER SEE IT COOOOOOOMIIIIIIN
[2:38:03] <+thechungiestofbois> @ThomasOfTroy because they don't know if she is using a persona
[2:38:04] <clumsydemiurge> SourPls YOU'LL NEVER SEE IT COMING SourPls
[2:38:05] <%lemon_rinds> THIS IS SO GOOD OH MAN
[2:38:05] <revoltingimp> you can't have a fucking musou game without hard rock
[2:38:07] <%Arkfyre> @ThomasOfTroy they dont know what her persona is, so it's the skill with a ?
[2:38:10] <Calamity2007> @PirateMike_ I'm not, it literally takes place 3 months after Persona 5. The Phantom Thieves originally were going to get together for a summer vacation but apparently new cognitive shinnanigans are going on again all over the country
[2:38:14] <+tempestzephyr> oh man, mona better not heal the boss
[2:38:15] <rcand9> all persona music is god tier
[2:38:28] <%Ipsenscastle> this remix is sick af

[2:38:31] <%viewtifulr> Judgement cut lytMOTIVATED lytMOTIVATED lytMOTIVATED lytMOTIVATED
[2:38:34] <OneThousandTomatoes> did pat show off the music settings?

[2:38:36] <+cafefunk> God i love how stylish everyone is
[2:38:41] <Calamity2007> @Arkfyre Yeah, whether it is actually a persona or just an artificial copy
[2:38:47] <Lunalios> this is a rad remix.
[2:38:50] <clumsydemiurge> yusuke's gun is a reference to DmC Vergil's abortion rifle
[2:39:12] <%ringabal> ITS SHOWTIME BAYBEEE
[2:39:13] <problemagic> oh no
[2:39:19] <rcand9> really>?
[2:39:19] <LycheeMusings> @clumsydemiurge  lol
[2:39:20] <BurdRightsActivist> Futaba, shut the fuck up holy hell
[2:39:22] <heartlesshealer> nuclear is the other weakness, I think you have it with one of Joker's personas if you really need it
[2:39:22] <+Dragon4234> @PatStaresAt How do you feel about the dungeon length so far?
[2:39:25] <BurdRightsActivist> we get it you're a game
[2:39:30] <heartlesshealer> that looked great
[2:39:36] <+CookieCutter007> Looking good JOker
[2:39:48] <revoltingimp> all the personas getting their own tiny flourish in Joker's showtime, is such a cool detail
[2:39:52] <%PanicSwytch> Will this stream won't have a vod? Is Pat gonna delete it
[2:40:16] <+Dragon4234> @PatStaresAt Do you think that since you can leave and recover whenever you want, they make battles a lot more tough then just resource drains?
[2:40:23] <rcand9> PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[2:40:25] <problemagic> WOW
[2:40:28] <clumsydemiurge> SCHUM
[2:40:30] <%valriot> eeeyoooohh
[2:40:36] <$TallYoda08> PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[2:40:38] <rcand9> thats DOPE
[2:40:38] <Calamity2007> @revoltingimp Yeah even if in the end it is just, "nuke them with the persona's dominate element"
[2:40:39] <problemagic> WOW VERGIL
[2:40:42] <%goose_attack_almanac> SUBARASHI
[2:40:45] <%viewtifulr> It would of been cooler to see him dash around slashing
[2:40:47] <+eldrinos> damn that looked cool as shit.
[2:40:51] <%Agami23> very stylish
[2:40:55] <$Pineapplemack> Pineapplemack subscribed at Tier 1. 
[2:40:59] <s1rcuit> it looks crazy
[2:41:00] <+ahdurian> damn it looks like a lot of fun
[2:41:03] <%GarbageQueenEllie> It feels so tongue-in-cheek
[2:41:04] <%bhp_99> its an actual game
[2:41:05] <+TaurusOxford> so, does this game get the Pat approval?
[2:41:06] <$SGrim> I just got here. Why's that?
[2:41:07] <OblivionSword1> wow this looks very impressive
[2:41:08] <penitentpendant> Much effort for a Musou
[2:41:09] <%QueequegTheater> the party is literally just style switching
[2:41:10] <%MisterRockett> Why does she talk like a bad JRPG villain?
[2:41:12] <%XeroSigmaPrime> VERGIL?!
[2:41:13] <Calamity2007> There is a lot of things you need to keep track of
[2:41:15] <%XeroSigmaPrime> WHAT
[2:41:17] <%Jekado> god that katana style is such a musou game
[2:41:19] <T_Sasquatch> iim still amazed i didnt know this game was releasing or getting released if you guys didnt talk about it
[2:41:23] <%Daxalog> Thats rich coming from this series
[2:41:23] <+king_of_beggars> It's the best Musou game ever made, and all they had to do was make it not a Musou game.
[2:41:25] <%XeroSigmaPrime> IS YUSUKE JUST VERGIL NOW?!
[2:41:27] <+eldrinos> @MisterRockett bc she is, they're in a bad light novel
[2:41:30] <rcand9> i have to admit i wasnt expecting  much just a cash grab
[2:41:33] <+Mailboy> does joker still have the wild card? or just arsene?
[2:41:35] <+Dragon4234> @PatStaresAt Do you think that since you can leave and recover whenever you want, they make battles a lot more tough then just resource drains?
[2:41:38] <clumsydemiurge> @MisterRockett this level is based on a bad isekai
[2:41:38] <OneThousandTomatoes> yes
[2:41:42] <penitentpendant> I assume they're supposed to be 'game long' unlocks
[2:41:42] <B1ak3N1k05999> Yep
[2:41:42] <OneThousandTomatoes> hes vegul
[2:41:43] <TehMud> I thought it'd just be another Dynasty Warriors skin but nope
[2:41:46] <Blank9> there's only the 4
[2:41:50] <Daniel_Is_I> I've been grinding a fair bit and I've got about half of the characters maxed out
[2:41:51] <+thechungiestofbois> @PatStaresAt you'll have them all done by the 4th-5th palace
[2:41:56] <tattleworm> aot great, hyrule great, berserk...
[2:41:56] <%ringabal> @PatStaresAt Gonna need to stick to one character if you want to master them quickly
[2:41:56] <rcand9> yes
[2:41:57] <Calamity2007> @MisterRockett Because it is a joke that the writer who this Jail takes from is a bad writer that plagerizes
[2:41:57] <+rbakervv> @MisterRockett the owner of this dungeon wrote a horrible isekai light novel, it's theme dominates this level
[2:41:57] <%Ipsenscastle> Why is the girl with heart-pigtails wearing a giant condom?
[2:41:58] <%cvp5127> LUL
[2:42:01] <rcand9> this is a fact
[2:42:01] <%MisterRockett> @MisterRockett THAT'S AMAZING
[2:42:01] <%viewtifulr> Money
[2:42:04] <OldManDeckardCain> BECAUSE MONEY PAT
[2:42:04] <OblivionSword1> yeah
[2:42:07] <clumsydemiurge> Did Atlus help them with this though?
[2:42:07] <mighty_fine_trousers> weird right? wish this much effort went into their mainline series
[2:42:08] <Bladeexe> Because they are using someone elses money
[2:42:08] <Lunalios> LUL LUL LUL
[2:42:10] <+TaurusOxford> Truth
[2:42:12] <rcand9> shit it out hard
[2:42:12] <Sol_Install> OH 100%
[2:42:12] <%isolex_> M O N E Y
[2:42:14] <%kewlmyc> Fire Emblem Warriors was shitted out as well
[2:42:19] <heartlesshealer> Probably because they're worried about messing up other people's stuff
[2:42:19] <OblivionSword1> except for Berserk
[2:42:20] <+allups> the love the IP i guess i actually find that very funny
[2:42:22] <s1rcuit> maybe they're trying to network
[2:42:24] <coldfire0007> They are probably bored with their own projects
[2:42:25] <Calamity2007> Hey Dynasty Warriors 8 was fine
[2:42:26] <%ringabal> Look at this Manhua
[2:42:27] <heartlesshealer> I get like that with cleaning
[2:42:29] <rcand9> yeah
[2:42:29] <%thbluewarden> dw probably just keeps the lights on
[2:42:30] <revoltingimp> I would still have liked a fighting game, but I am still so fucking happy we got a persona musou
[2:42:33] <penitentpendant> It's that weird style of work ethic where you don't care about your own stuff but you'll crunch down on someone else's
[2:42:35] <OldManDeckardCain> berserk? Kappa
[2:42:36] <OneThousandTomatoes> wasnt hyrule warriors 1 also shit out?
[2:42:37] <+king_of_beggars> It's almost like Dynasty Warriors are tech demos to attract investors.
[2:42:38] <+abrupt_abe> Attack on Titan musuo is pretty good
[2:42:39] <TehMud> its ture
[2:42:39] <%isolex_> there was a FE warriors @kewlmyc ?
[2:42:40] <+Mailboy> @PatStaresAt you should actually try the one piece musou. it has weird fucked up launchers enviromental destructions and proper air combos
[2:42:40] <Bladeexe> Pat have you ran into any crashes with this game at all?
[2:42:42] <rcand9> they should just make persona spin offs
[2:42:43] <%MisterRockett> @Calamity2007 Not DW9 tho
[2:42:44] <WholesomeSandwhichPeddler> Omega Force hinges on being complete garbage or actual great spinoffs
[2:42:47] <Blank9> koei tecmo's some weird shit, they're doing that but also making nioh's at the same time
[2:42:47] <clumsydemiurge> #FE Musou when
[2:42:48] <Calamity2007> I'm still looking forward to Samurai Warriors 5
[2:42:48] <%GalacticaPhanto> @calamity2007 9 was terrible
[2:42:49] <Sol_Install> how the game tho?
[2:42:57] <%DappercatEsquire> OWWWOWWOWOWOWOWW
[2:42:57] <Calamity2007> @MisterRockett Nope
[2:42:58] <xxshadowxx416> can this be the next persona game play
[2:42:59] <OblivionSword1> how far have you gone in the story @PatStaresAt ?
[2:43:00] <%StrawberryPantsu> Romance of the 3 kingdom is an IP to be fair
[2:43:00] <%kyh9> A much cuter robot than Makoto
[2:43:01] <%Ipsenscastle> Sophia is wearing a condom for a suit
[2:43:02] <%Agami23> i want them to make a pikmin game
[2:43:03] <Daniel_Is_I> She also ordered a gold bar and gave Ryuji a heart attack.
[2:43:04] <heartlesshealer> Better FI
[2:43:04] <+king_of_beggars> SHE TRIED TO HAVE A PERSON KILLED AT THE START OF THE GAME
[2:43:05] <rcand9> beep beep boop
[2:43:05] <$SGrim> Ginger cutesy robot? SIGN ME THE FUCK UP!
[2:43:05] <Darkdrome7> you just like her cuz she's a redhead
[2:43:07] <LycheeMusings> does she also beep boop?
[2:43:07] <+allups> they should make an ultimate alliance
[2:43:13] <aaropoll> would recommend this if I haven't played the original
[2:43:14] <jcflyguy> She's not a poochie?
[2:43:14] <%Frodiddly> we get it she has red hair pat
[2:43:14] <%kyh9> Sophia is like "Uguu" and Makoto is like "Beep Boop"
[2:43:17] <s1rcuit> her voice is cute
[2:43:18] <%SveriSageAdvice> Miyamoto was the reason Hyrule Warriors was like all the other musou games, they originally were going to make it like a traditional Zelda til he stepped in and said no
[2:43:21] <DirgeNovak> Praise accepted ~<3
[2:43:21] <%Broken_Sonex> @PatStaresAt I'd be into Persona a lot more if they all played like this.
[2:43:22] <%ringabal> My DoorDash App Can't Possibly Be This Hip!!
[2:43:25] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Sophia does look like an adorable lil toaster companion
[2:43:25] <%Burdenslo> Why she so smol
[2:43:25] <%kewlmyc> @isolex_ Yes. Mostly the cast of Shadow Dragon, Awakening, and sadly Fates. Like Ike isn't even the game for fucks sake
[2:43:26] <%kyh9> Sophia > Makoto
[2:43:28] <WholesomeSandwhichPeddler> He makes my heart go WOWOWOWOW
[2:43:35] <Calamity2007> @king_of_beggars Oh boy I'm sure Woolie will have a lot of things to say about this game and Persona 5 in general
[2:43:39] <rcand9> @aaropoll hell no go play p5 or royal
[2:43:41] <%StrawberryPantsu> FINAL FANTASY MUSOU WHEN?!
[2:43:42] <Daniel_Is_I> You did get it, but it respawns when you leave and come back
[2:43:43] <%chiazam> Are there any other returning adult characters other than Sojiro?
[2:43:45] <APB_Harleqyn> This game looks fun - is it something I can get into as a standalone (I have never played a Persona game before)?
[2:43:48] <Blank9> fe warriors is a great game, just eh cast
[2:43:53] <%Broken_Sonex> I'd be into Persona a lot more if they all played like this.
[2:43:55] <@SoFarFetched> she sounds like toad when he crashes in Mario kart 64? geefThink
[2:43:55] <TehMud> Sophia's victory pose is the BEST
[2:44:01] <%kyh9> This game just feels like better P5 in its writing at times.  Not all of the time but the party dynamics are WAY better here
[2:44:04] <clumsydemiurge> how do you feel about her wanting to do big murder though
[2:44:07] <+tigerfang86> wait is she like a person
[2:44:08] <+tigerfang86> or a robot
[2:44:13] <%weissguard> LUL
[2:44:14] <s1rcuit> her weapon is yoyos?
[2:44:15] <Sol_Install> robo
[2:44:16] <DirgeNovak> Absolutely do not even consider playing this before P5
[2:44:16] <Daniel_Is_I> She is an AI
[2:44:18] <+thechungiestofbois> she's an AI
[2:44:19] <%kyh9> @tigerfang86 Yes
[2:44:19] <%SveriSageAdvice> ok that is flashy as hell, i love it
[2:44:20] <Calamity2007> @aaropoll This spoils a LOT of P5 so play that or Royal first
[2:44:20] <+SunnyVarietyPack> An AI
[2:44:21] <%viewtifulr> Oh i get it Funnels
[2:44:22] <BigManLugan> CUTE
[2:44:24] <+CookieCutter007> BOTH
[2:44:27] <+tigerfang86> nice smartphone waifu
[2:44:27] <+crowmium> Ciri isn't AI lol
[2:44:29] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Robot *IS* person.
[2:44:33] <Lunalios> like Aeigis?
[2:44:35] <%valriot> Her skills all having a ? at the end is great
[2:44:40] <TheWashoutXY> Whats the impression of the game so far?
[2:44:42] <Daniel_Is_I> She pops out of a box.
[2:44:44] <Blank9> she aigis but cooler
[2:44:45] <rcand9> siri but adorable
[2:44:46] <Zombrocom> Siri not Ciri
[2:44:48] <Blank9> and less horny
[2:44:50] <%kyh9> @GarbageQueenEllie Well Makoto isn't
[2:44:50] <Zombrocom> Like the phone app
[2:44:52] <%thedankestmeeme> why not like 2b
[2:44:53] <Visorak6> Who's the guy with the guns in the intro?
[2:44:54] <penitentpendant> Aegis had some daughter's offscreen apparently
[2:44:56] <+tigerfang86> some BRICKS
[2:44:56] <OBS_VinnieK> the game has made me scared to use Show Times due to the treasure phantoms
[2:44:59] <+ahdurian> Would you want future Personas to be more like this, or more like the turn-based ones?
[2:44:59] <%kewlmyc> Oh, so Aigis again?
[2:44:59] <danielm427> Sophia is Towa from trails of cold steel
[2:45:04] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @kyh9 lol
[2:45:05] <OneThousandTomatoes> sophias also like "why don't we just kill them?"
[2:45:05] <%kyh9> "Is THIS what this skill is?"
[2:45:05] <Lunalios> wtf??
[2:45:06] <DasFreekman> Is this more muso, or dmc like?
[2:45:07] <%Ipsenscastle> QR codes
[2:45:07] <OblivionSword1> Pithos huh
[2:45:08] <aaropoll> I don't care for turn based combat thats why I avoided the original
[2:45:09] <+tempestzephyr> Amnesia as always
[2:45:10] <$SGrim> 4 PC towers sounds like a modern Persona to me.
[2:45:12] <specialpipo> missingno's
[2:45:14] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @DirgeNovak I blame atlus for not releasing p5 on pc yet, so I'm playing it to spite them
[2:45:14] <%caramelatte1> So she is gonna be a mary?
[2:45:15] <%isolex_> I like her
[2:45:19] <+king_of_beggars> She doesn't have a Persona, she's just "copying what you did"
[2:45:19] <masterfire23> man Matt mercer is so cool
[2:45:21] <Calamity2007> @DasFreekman Musou with RPG elements
[2:45:22] <BigManLugan> Sophia is a Newtype
[2:45:23] <xxshadowxx416> can they do this with p4
[2:45:24] <revoltingimp> its all an imitation so she can fightt shadows
[2:45:26] <wantedsafe471> How does an AI get tired? Is her battery low?
[2:45:28] <rcand9> LUL
[2:45:33] <s1rcuit> makes sense since she's a robot, thus her personality is undevelped
[2:45:34] <%Ipsenscastle> @specialpipo they ARE missingnos!
[2:45:35] <%isolex_> murder tho
[2:45:35] <%weissguard> Akechi would love her LUL
[2:45:36] <%Arkfyre> Sophia says murder is cool
[2:45:41] <clumsydemiurge> also sophia in gnosticism is yaldabaoth's main opponent so I wonder if that'll go anywhere
[2:45:41] <Calamity2007> @DasFreekman Though I guess your part members are style switching in a way
[2:45:42] <%Broken_Sonex> KAMOSHIDA DISERVED DEATH
[2:45:43] <yourliteraldog> No you can't murder the serial child molster
[2:45:43] <%kyh9> Pat says "Wait, Why DONT we just murder them"
[2:45:44] <Ks201> Don‚Äôt even know if what she uses is a persona
[2:45:44] <TehMud> EXTERMINATE
[2:45:44] <%GarbageQueenEllie> She's got to learn the value of LIFE
[2:45:45] <Blank9> they don't like murder, but sometimes they do, as a treat
[2:45:48] <+thechungiestofbois> "Let's just murder this Jpop Idol" -Sophia
[2:45:49] <Daniel_Is_I> "It's not part of our CODE!" "But murder is so much more efficient!"
[2:45:51] <TG_Cid11> @PatStaresAt Is she the Fifth Element?
[2:45:54] <rcand9> dont murder them please sophia
[2:45:54] <%kyh9> That's why PAt loves her so much
[2:45:56] <$SGrim> Sofia is right in many cases
[2:45:57] <%caramelatte1> Sophie wants optimal results
[2:45:59] <HeroToxiko> oh she's the power f brutal murder LUL
[2:46:01] <+CookieCutter007> the first solution
[2:46:02] <%viewtifulr> I'll kill Akechi 100 time sover before I let this company fall
[2:46:03] <penitentpendant> Sophia Skynet
[2:46:04] <%shootbang_exe> Sophia says murder is efficient
[2:46:05] <Sol_Install> Akechi did that to futaba mom and haru dad so murder big no for my book
[2:46:05] <%cvp5127> akechi agrees
[2:46:06] <Lunalios> akechi would love her
[2:46:08] <heartlesshealer> she helps you guy weapons
[2:46:09] <TehMud> I like the cut of her jib
[2:46:10] <Calamity2007> Someone make that one meme
[2:46:12] <+king_of_beggars> Murder can create a greater amount of happiness for humanity than it can create unhappiness.
[2:46:12] <heartlesshealer> buy*
[2:46:14] <%chiazam> JOKER LETS EVERYONE HAVE ONE MURDER, AS A TREAT LMAO
[2:46:17] <$SGrim> @CookieCutter007 first and final solutions?
[2:46:18] <%kyh9> No DLC unfortunately
[2:46:18] <+crowmium> Technically it's homicide
[2:46:20] <B1ak3N1k05999> Murder good Sophia 2021
[2:46:21] <rcand9> BOOO
[2:46:25] <s1rcuit> murder is the most efficient way to stop your enemies from being a threat again
[2:46:27] <%kyh9> Yeah, even Age of Calamity is getting DLC
[2:46:33] <%caramelatte1> No futaba playable character T-T
[2:46:33] <Yummy_Nukes> "but why not murder?" because the law of this land prevents us!
[2:46:34] <%charp35> you think atlus would at least do costume dlc
[2:46:36] <rcand9> true
[2:46:40] <+Ancopro> yee thats zelda
[2:46:40] <clumsydemiurge> age of calamitous framerates
[2:46:44] <%Ranryu692> I just want the P4 cast a few years later in SOMETHIGN
[2:46:45] <Calamity2007> @kyh9 Though I am far less interested in it than Hyrule Warriors
[2:46:48] <rcand9> make a strikers 2 then
[2:46:53] <enerkaizer> didn't strikers under perform in Japan?
[2:46:57] <%BigCoffee> Is Sophia real?
[2:46:57] <s1rcuit> the fact that a prequel is getting dlc annoys me
[2:46:58] <%shootbang_exe> too bad I want more of this and not hyrule warriors lmao
[2:46:58] <rcand9> scramble sorry
[2:47:05] <%weissguard> Hyrule Warriors got the King's Ransom of content, and this game seems more like it's attempting to go for quality first. (Not digging at HW, but y'know.)
[2:47:10] <%valriot> I do think the cast and plot dont reeeeeally hold up. P5 and especially Royal kinda closed the deal on this crew, so its just like "yep, you are stupid Ryuji. Yes Ann, you LOVE clothes"
[2:47:13] <+kevlarkoala> I just tuned in, who is this Not Joker ass chick?
[2:47:17] <%kyh9> Yeah, it is a bit weird that we dont see Akechi at all but I guess dead guys don't get to show up
[2:47:28] <+king_of_beggars> Pat did you get that treasure chest at the very start of the dungeon?
[2:47:28] <%GarbageQueenEllie> I mean, sometimes capital punishment is justifiable. But if you kill every palace ruler, who's to say you shouldn't kill anybody?
[2:47:34] <+king_of_beggars> The one under the statue.
[2:47:39] <yourliteraldog> Could You render someone catatonic by messing up their Palace. Technically it's not murder.
[2:47:41] <Daniel_Is_I> Boy this guy loves writing about orbs
[2:47:42] <%Broken_Sonex> @valriot And Morgana is still a simp
[2:47:43] <%GarbageQueenEllie> *Everybody
[2:47:44] <$RealThiele> i feel like hyrule warriors 2 was crushed by asset quality if they just ported nintys assets
[2:47:50] <enerkaizer> remember guys: strikers was done before Royal, meaning it uses the canon of regular P5
[2:47:50] <Calamity2007> @weissguard Hyrule Warriors is like a bag of chips, you know what you are getting but it is enjoyable, this is more of a full course meal
[2:47:51] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt and yet you keep participating
[2:47:55] <coldfire0007> Red orb...
[2:47:58] <TehMud> I wrote it :)
[2:47:59] <penitentpendant> This is derivative work of cookie cutters
[2:48:00] <Calamity2007> Is it worse than Sword Art though?
[2:48:01] <Daniel_Is_I> Imagine having fractally-padded fetch quests in your light novel
[2:48:02] <@SoFarFetched> Sophia keeps making me think she just bursted out of Space Channel 5
[2:48:08] <Blank9> he's actually just writing Ready Player One
[2:48:19] <s1rcuit> @coldfire0007 2 to go
[2:48:23] <Calamity2007> @enerkaizer It does have some references to Royal though but it is vague enough that it doesn't confirm nor deny it
[2:48:26] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Still wish I could kick Morgana's ass tho
[2:48:30] <rcand9> @Blank9 Clap
[2:48:36] <%cvp5127> wtf
[2:48:41] <Visorak6> For the first time
[2:48:43] <Calamity2007> OH THANK GOD
[2:48:43] <rcand9> CUM
[2:48:44] <%barrakuta371> For a second I thought sophia's persona were floating QR codes
[2:48:46] <%Alazull> Bruh
[2:48:46] <%valriot> @Broken_Sonex Exactly, like aside from Ryuji saying the F word, theres.. oof, theyre kinda just spouting the same lines from the previous game and its a bit dry
[2:48:47] <%charp35> that should be in the main games
[2:48:49] <@SoFarFetched> no keep switching more
[2:48:54] <%chiazam> CAP
[2:48:55] <Saltmeisterr> SWORD TRICK
[2:48:57] <penitentpendant> It's a shame so much QoL goes into the next game instead of patching it in the present iteration
[2:48:57] <Lunalios> SWORD GUN TRICK SWORD
[2:48:57] <%Alazull> That's how it should work in the ACTUAL GAME
[2:48:59] <%Burdenslo> No party member deserves an ass kicking more than junpei
[2:48:59] <%Mrbaconator> GUNTRICKSWORDGUN
[2:48:59] <@SoFarFetched> so we suddenly hear JOHNATHANCHARLOTTEJOHNATHONCHARLOTTE
[2:49:02] <+abrupt_abe> Man I hope the next Persona game takes quality of life inspiration from this Dynasty Warriors game
[2:49:03] <OneThousandTomatoes> joker says CUM
[2:49:04] <yourliteraldog> Style Switch
[2:49:05] <%weissguard> swordtrickguntrickgunswordtrickgunswordROYAL GUARD
[2:49:06] <Daniel_Is_I> Oh yeah you gotta upgrade your personas. You got a ton of level 2-10 ones
[2:49:06] <clumsydemiurge> this isekai is like a novelization of a NES RPG
[2:49:07] <%StrawberryPantsu> TRICKSWORGUNTRIC
[2:49:08] <%chiazam> SWORD TRICK SWORD
[2:49:08] <+king_of_beggars> That better be in Persona 6 I fucking swear.
[2:49:09] <HeroToxiko> LIT
[2:49:12] <heartlesshealer> GUN ROYAL GUN TRICK SWORD ROYAL
[2:49:20] <%valriot> GUNTRICKSWORDROYGUNTRICKROYSWORDTRICKGUN
[2:49:21] <TehMud> I also like how on the UI for Joker it shows a drawing of each Persona when you switch
[2:49:22] <%ringabal> COMEONCOMEONCOMEON
[2:49:28] <%Broken_Sonex> @valriot Yeah, it REALLY feels like they're just walking on old ground.
[2:49:28] <Calamity2007> @clumsydemiurge Pretty much, reminds me of that one dungeon in 4
[2:49:34] <+thechungiestofbois> I just like how Joker saying Hau Po  sounds like Wa Po
[2:49:36] <DirgeNovak> Can't wait for persona 6... in 2028
[2:49:41] <yourliteraldog> Cat wagon
[2:49:43] <Blank9> my favorite is still MMX4 Zero's wall jump noise YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH
[2:49:44] <revoltingimp> when you spam through his personas it makes me think of the Pokemon Rap someone made using the P5 Personas
[2:49:47] <%Burdenslo> RERERERERRRRELOAD
[2:49:50] <zhenthrim213> this 2nd dungeon is grind dungeon
[2:49:59] <clumsydemiurge> BURN BURN BURN TO THE GROUND
[2:50:04] <rcand9> are you a mona man or a teddy boy pat?
[2:50:06] <sajuk_khar> Catobusso!
[2:50:25] <Calamity2007> @Broken_Sonex yeah it is kind of ironic that this arc of the game is making fun of a guy with no original ideas where the game itself retreads a lot of its old ideas
[2:50:29] <OblivionSword1> these fights goes by so fast
[2:50:29] <Toad_2> did the localization team really mess up Pyrojack's name? He's called "Jack O Lantern" in this.
[2:50:41] <+SparrowHW> has the game been crashing occasionally for anyone else?
[2:50:47] <%asgard147> limesBlep
[2:51:05] <+netrac> It crashed me 3 times total
[2:51:05] <clumsydemiurge> big drugs
[2:51:07] <%wembleyttv> Just keep saving
[2:51:10] <%MisterRockett> OH MY GOD THIS IS THE CUTEST MENU EVER
[2:51:10] <Calamity2007> I haven't had it crash on the switch at all
[2:51:11] <OneThousandTomatoes> i love this menu
[2:51:13] <TehMud> Yeah mine's crashed twice so far. Luckily I'm paranoid about Saving so I haven't lost too much
[2:51:13] <clumsydemiurge> big drugs on cryptocurrency black market
[2:51:18] <+tigerfang86> YEAH
[2:51:18] <wantedsafe471> lol
[2:51:18] <%Broken_Sonex> @Calamity2007 It's a shame. I'd be into Persona a lot more if they all played like this, boy howdy.
[2:51:20] <rcand9> yeaaa
[2:51:21] <Daniel_Is_I> My game crashed and I lost 4 hours of progress because I forgot the golden rule of Persona games: SAVE NOW
[2:51:21] <+tigerfang86> YEAH AMAZOOM
[2:51:22] <Coconosuga> i want her hair
[2:51:23] <BurdRightsActivist> @MisterRockett no.
[2:51:23] <enerkaizer> she really looks like Ulalas daughter o_o
[2:51:24] <huskarl_zap> If the question is "Did the translation team mess up blank" then the answer is always yes
[2:51:24] <TheWashoutXY> BUT IS THERE JAM BREAD?
[2:51:26] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Does it matter if i havent beat the regualr games?
[2:51:26] <TehMud> LUL
[2:51:27] <B1ak3N1k05999> This is adorable
[2:51:28] <yourliteraldog> Wacdonalds and Amazoom
[2:51:29] <revoltingimp> I think i've only had 1 or 2 crashes in my entire 60 or so hours of playtime.
[2:51:31] <%Agami23> "mental floss"
[2:51:36] <+netrac> Rice is the most exclusive ingredient in the early game
[2:51:36] <%DappercatEsquire> Haven't had a crash, had a weird glitch where it kept switching the controller between Xbox and Playstation configs while using an Xbox controller
[2:51:38] <Sol_Install> Atlus would never make all persona games like this
[2:51:40] <zhenthrim213> has anyone gotten like 60000 from a treasure demon?
[2:51:47] <+Dragon4234> @toad_2 it was like that in P5 where were you the past 4 years?
[2:51:48] <clumsydemiurge> a bondjob
[2:51:49] <%MisterRockett> @BurdRightsActivist What do you mean "no"?
[2:51:50] <Calamity2007> Every game needs a cooking and/or a fishing minigame these days
[2:51:52] <+king_of_beggars> There's SP drinks in that machine.
[2:51:53] <rcand9> shes not siri shes alexa?
[2:51:54] <TurtlesAndTentacles> regular
[2:51:54] <zecht89> do people really like these atlus spinoffs?
[2:51:57] <wantedsafe471> All Big companies have 2 o's as part of their names
[2:52:00] <+survivalone> is this game actually good, or is just musou with persona dressing
[2:52:09] <Sol_Install> the cost to make all persona games like this would be... fuck idk
[2:52:10] <%DedlokPM> You bought Rice @PatStaresAt
[2:52:10] <s1rcuit> so are they driving around Japan in that mini rv?
[2:52:12] <revoltingimp> get that rice! a stable of the japanese diet!
[2:52:15] <clumsydemiurge> @survivalone it's persona with musou dressing
[2:52:19] <Sol_Install> @survivalone REALLY GOOD
[2:52:28] <Daniel_Is_I> It's really good
[2:52:32] <+netrac> It is a Kingdome hearts lite with persona dressing
[2:52:32] <+Dragon4234> @zecht89 dude people love Persona tho
[2:52:37] <penitentpendant> This game is more competent than it sounds on paper
[2:52:39] <+tigerfang86> wow joker youre SO HOT
[2:52:42] <%ringabal> RYUJI NO
[2:52:43] <Saltmeisterr> w o a w
[2:52:44] <TheWinged7> and already clipped
[2:52:45] <penitentpendant> By a margin
[2:52:45] <zhenthrim213> it feels like Senran and musou dressing
[2:52:47] <%Broken_Sonex> I want Persona games to play like this from now on. Shame they won't though.
[2:52:51] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Makoto's too busy sucking Ann's dick to suck yours
[2:52:56] <OldManDeckardCain> RYUJI YES
[2:53:09] <Huntercd> The cat on the dining table can't be hygienic
[2:53:26] <clumsydemiurge> not a cat so its fine Kappa
[2:53:30] <rcand9> people thought hyrule warriors games were the good ones this shows the devs are bigger persona marks than zelda one
[2:53:31] <%blaggablag> I have to give it to them, if you're gonna spend half the game time in menus, having them be literal menu porn is fantastic
[2:53:32] <+king_of_beggars> Side note that has nothing to do with the actual game, I fucking LOVE their RV. It's so nice.
[2:53:32] <revoltingimp> He's not a cat tho!
[2:53:37] <%aishman> @PatStaresAt Does this game have a time limit like a Persona game or naw?
[2:53:40] <xxshadowxx416> @broken_sonex yes a shame
[2:53:41] <%BallerSwagBro9k> he cant believe you either LUL
[2:53:42] <Sol_Install> @Broken_Sonex your asking for a lot tbh. cause it still takes two companies tbh and that's a lot of money being split up.
[2:53:43] <zecht89> @Dragon4234 sure, me too, i got all my friends into it back with p3 but these spinoffs rub me the wrong way
[2:53:46] <penitentpendant> At least it's not revenge of Dognut... for now
[2:53:53] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @king_of_beggars Rv gang is Best gang
[2:53:57] <+Dragon4234> @patstaresat make sure to get the item recovery bond skill it works on so recovery too
[2:54:05] <mattdaddyd365> Are their side quests?
[2:54:11] <Huntercd> Morgana licks his nuts. he shouldn't be on the table
[2:54:16] <+Dragon4234> @patstaresat Sp recover
[2:54:17] <Zerotoad5> There are side quests
[2:54:29] <zhenthrim213> Slimes are rough
[2:54:31] <wantedsafe471> thats one tough pile of rancid meat
[2:54:36] <huskarl_zap> @huntercd lol nice
[2:54:38] <Calamity2007> @mattdaddyd365 I haven't seen any at the moment but you can chat with your party members to get items and raise bond
[2:54:52] <OneThousandTomatoes> @mattdaddyd365 I don't believe so, which is part of why its like a third p5's length
[2:54:55] <zhenthrim213> oh no BLAST PROCESSING
[2:54:59] <%Broken_Sonex> @Broken_Sonex I just hate turnbased. Guess I'll never play any of them i guess. I'd be into Persona a lot more if they all played like this.
[2:55:01] <huskarl_zap> Mona gets out his red rocket when Ann is around
[2:55:07] <+survivalone> so tanky
[2:55:07] <%GarbageQueenEllie> I think reusing old ideas is fine. As long as you try something new every now and then, like w/ this
[2:55:07] <huskarl_zap> while on the table
[2:55:08] <+survivalone> wtf
[2:55:21] <netrac> You unlock side quests latter
[2:55:32] <Calamity2007> @Broken_Sonex Fair enough, hopefully they do give this a shot again, try the crossover they originally planned
[2:55:39] <%valriot> MIRACLE PUNCH
[2:55:54] <DawnsRoyal> what difficulty is pat playing on?
[2:55:56] <+king_of_beggars> I love Mona's little feet.
[2:56:04] <%AzureGale> Target its weakness to [wind] wind!
[2:56:05] <TehMud> This game so fun
[2:56:06] <OblivionSword1> this reminds me a lot of the raidou kuzunoha games
[2:56:07] <@SoFarFetched> geefThink
[2:56:09] <Calamity2007> @GarbageQueenEllie Yeah, I just find it funny that this arc says plagerising and using old ideas is bad
[2:56:09] <+Dragon4234> @patstaresat Blast Processing let‚Äôs you do her timed attacks in the air
[2:56:09] <TehMud> Is good time
[2:56:16] <%Puhff> PogChamp
[2:56:31] <enerkaizer> I'm still wondering if Atlus is legit just thinking about a full on persona 5-2 at this point
[2:56:41] <%valriot> BLAST PROCESSING LUL
[2:56:43] <BoneofMalkav> Her upgrade is your face! LUL
[2:56:46] <i_need_sciss0rz> can someone enjoy this without playing P5?
[2:56:48] <+CookieCutter007> monkaS just frame attacks
[2:56:49] <+rbakervv> it just makes perfect timing more pwerfull
[2:56:53] <penitentpendant> Perfect timing increase damage?
[2:56:53] <+HotBloodedHero> MORE MAX ACT
[2:56:54] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @Calamity2007 Gotta make fun of yourself sometimes, yeah? Though idk if that's actually what they're doing
[2:56:54] <%AzureGale> Is there an upgrade that gives Sophia pants
[2:56:56] <wantedsafe471> lol, Blast Processing
[2:56:57] <@SoFarFetched> You'd be confused on the story if you dont play P5
[2:56:57] <Daniel_Is_I> I think it gives +1 upgrade tier
[2:57:00] <rcand9> theres so many games i am in big need of getting, ps5 and demons souls remake gets pushed back further
[2:57:01] <i_need_sciss0rz> only switch game that's persona ;(
[2:57:07] <@SoFarFetched> cause it takes place 3 months after the events of Persona 5
[2:57:08] <TehMud> Also totally on point about Omega doing its best work with other IPs. I always think it will just be a Dynasty Warriors skin but noooooo
[2:57:08] <%Agami23> oh i get it. you do the perfect timing and it gives a full on power up for abit.
[2:57:08] <Calamity2007> @i_need_sciss0rz Yes but you will be spoiled a LOT on P5
[2:57:21] <coldfire0007> You dont have to back out each time
[2:57:37] <DawnsRoyal> Haru sure about that?
[2:57:37] <i_need_sciss0rz> @calamity2007 ahh thanks
[2:57:42] <CursedNobleman> so this is Dynasty Warriors P5 by koeitec right?
[2:57:42] <%bread_assassin> Are their only four per character are are their more once you get the 4th?
[2:57:45] <bigdumbstreams> this is just the warrirors persona right
[2:57:46] <zhenthrim213> Yuske cast sukakaja in his air combos its rad
[2:58:03] <clumsydemiurge> can you imagine people who never played persona buying this game on the switch because of joker in smash
[2:58:05] <@SoFarFetched> its not quite warriors with how the map is and battling is
[2:58:06] <TehMud> Yeah Strikers will spoil the majority of P5 for you
[2:58:07] <+Dragon4234> @bread_assassin 4 is it
[2:58:11] <%Broken_Sonex> @SoFarFetched But what if you don't like how the Persona games play?
[2:58:12] <Calamity2007> @CursedNobleman Kinda but it isn't just a musou game with a p5 coat of paint
[2:58:21] <zhenthrim213> Ryujis is a must
[2:58:22] <Big_Dream> how is this game
[2:58:25] <Lunalios> cuz he's always with the party
[2:58:27] <@SoFarFetched> @Broken_Sonex then you just watch LPs or Wiki the info.
[2:58:30] <CursedNobleman> @Calamity2007 what makes it more than a musou?
[2:58:36] <Calamity2007> I heard Ryuji is broken in this game
[2:58:40] <Yummy_Nukes> pat like gun
[2:58:40] <%Broken_Sonex> @SoFarFetched I'll do that,
[2:58:43] <i_need_sciss0rz> @clumsydemiurge I just haven't played P5 cuz no PS4 ;(
[2:58:45] <TehMud> I hope there's more than 4 and they just unlock later. Not yet for me though but I'm just past this Jail
[2:58:53] <rcand9> @i_need_sciss0rz unless you hate playing persona games just go back play p5 and then you will enjoy this more
[2:58:54] <+ahdurian> are we still early in the game or was Pat just being Pat and grinding?
[2:59:00] <zhenthrim213> @Calamity2007 he should come in ever boss fight
[2:59:06] <DawnsRoyal> @CursedNobleman its a lot more story focused and has a lot of jrpg elements, aswell as contained encounters
[2:59:09] <zhenthrim213> because massive dmg
[2:59:11] <@SoFarFetched> like if you're for sure knowing you will never play persona 5 cause of how it plays but wanna play this. its either watching LPs or wiki'ing the info.
[2:59:27] <CursedNobleman> @DawnsRoyal i see, the encounter packs are interesting.
[2:59:28] <Calamity2007> @CursedNobleman It carries a ton of mechanics from P5. So much as I would say that the only thing musou is the beat em up style in fights instead of turn based
[2:59:33] <clumsydemiurge> its good for bosses
[2:59:34] <@SoFarFetched> so you're not lost on information of the story and people.
[2:59:37] <rcand9> ryuji is the best
[2:59:37] <penitentpendant> I mean, making enemy encounters instanced actually helps the usual frame destruction Musou usually do
[2:59:39] <wantedsafe471> Charging up that Homerun
[2:59:52] <%AzureGale> Haru 4 lyfe
[3:00:03] <Calamity2007> I need to level up Haru
[3:00:08] <TehMud> I like Ryuji's fight style in alot of games but here everything's dead before he finished charging LUL
[3:00:33] <netrac> @TehMud Play on hard and that wont be an issue
[3:00:41] <penitentpendant> Ah, degraded miniboss is go
[3:00:54] <Calamity2007> @zhenthrim213 Yeah I'll keep that in mind for this next boss fight
[3:01:02] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Just finished P5R, t'was pretty good
[3:01:12] <Calamity2007> @penitentpendant Yet another cliche I guess
[3:01:29] <%Broken_Sonex> @SoFarFetched Like, THIS i what i thought Persona was gonna be like. Shame it isn't.
[3:01:29] <netrac> Enrage+psy is the most broken stuff
[3:01:34] <TehMud> @netrac I should try switching over. On Normal it seemd alright difficulty at the start but now is babby mode
[3:01:34] <rcand9> grenade launchers are so rad
[3:01:58] <penitentpendant> @Calamity2007 You can't escape them, so you should make intelligent use of 'em
[3:01:58] <zhenthrim213> @Calamity2007 his last talent makes his charge atks charge twice as fast
[3:02:02] <+rbakervv> @PatStaresAt you have some new personas in velvet room
[3:02:05] <+tigerfang86> b l u e
[3:02:10] <OneThousandTomatoes> blue orb in blue door? what intelligence
[3:02:11] <penitentpendant> Opening that purple door
[3:02:11] <Saltmeisterr> disc room
[3:02:11] <Blank9> I love when that one boss in p5 asks for you to choose someone to snipe
[3:02:14] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Blu
[3:02:15] <Blank9> and you can choose Haru
[3:02:15] <%AzureGale> I like how Pat's mind went to Dusk and not, say, DOOM
[3:02:21] <%ringabal> Heat the Key
[3:02:24] <Blank9> to snipe with a grenade launcher, the most precise of all guns
[3:02:28] <netrac> @TehMud I feel like hard makes you use the statuses/buffs more
[3:02:31] <CursedNobleman> Pat: P5S is just like Dusk.
[3:02:36] <+ahdurian> how far are we in the game right now?
[3:02:40] <skyentombment> @PatStaresAt What's he mystery of the orb, orb?
[3:02:43] <%shruke> pat is yellow orb
[3:02:50] <%Monkeyweed21> is this the 1st or second dungeon?
[3:02:52] <%AzureGale> Are there red and green orbs that open red and green doors too
[3:02:57] <rcand9> best jailer
[3:03:01] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Yo I love the Angels. Archangel is bro
[3:03:02] <skyentombment> @shruke Yorb, if you will
[3:03:03] <CursedNobleman> is pat wearing his trademark stockings?
[3:03:09] <+Dragon4234> @PatStaresAt Remember the persona changes Joker's C2, C3, and C5
[3:03:13] <zhenthrim213> i just got principality
[3:03:15] <%bravebravesrobin> Cheer500. Hey Pat, don't know if my new Subscriber message went through, but I'm a long time viewer (Machinima), who decided to go ahead and sub as a salutations for you engaging the Mustard Queen in Holy Matrimony.  Anyway, It was either subscribe to an Onlyfans or you, and I couldn't resist that hot orb action.
[3:03:15] <zecht89> power is cooler thoooo
[3:03:19] <BurdRightsActivist> Man, wouldn't it be nice to see these DEMONS in like a 3d game or something? haha, can''t imagine that being a thing
[3:03:31] <@SoFarFetched> @bravebravesrobin remove the period the cheer didn't go through.
[3:03:51] <%radregice> @BurdRightsActivist is that not whats happening here
[3:03:52] <%GarbageQueenEllie> What's y'all's fav early-midgame Persona?
[3:03:59] <%AzureGale> Be orb anew
[3:04:00] <@SoFarFetched> since it shows an icon when you cheer
[3:04:03] <%Burdenslo> Fucking love the angel dual wielding guns
[3:04:04] <enerkaizer> so, is the compendium regular sized, or did they downsize for strikers?
[3:04:11] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> if someone tuned in right now they'd think you're playing regular persona and not a musou, it's GREAT
[3:04:13] <Saltmeisterr> whens smt 5 coming out again?
[3:04:13] <Lunalios> matador looks rad
[3:04:14] <rcand9> this is so in depth its just persona with bare minimum muso
[3:04:23] <penitentpendant> Dat's a sleepy dog
[3:04:27] <%bravebravesrobin> how do you edit a previous message?
[3:04:29] <%AzureGale> Infinite: I AM NOT WEAK
[3:04:31] <Daniel_Is_I> Arsene's level-ups get so damn expensive
[3:04:31] <@SoFarFetched> you cant
[3:04:34] <@SoFarFetched> you just gotta send it again
[3:04:37] <%Burdenslo> @saltmeisterr this year
[3:04:41] <@SoFarFetched> messages can only be deleted in here.
[3:04:44] <Calamity2007> @Daniel_Is_I Are they worth it?
[3:04:45] <@SoFarFetched> by mods/streamer
[3:04:52] <Lunalios> good
[3:04:52] <%Monkeyweed21> Give Arsene big PP
[3:04:54] <zhenthrim213> yup
[3:04:59] <Parapattern> PP PooPoo
[3:05:02] <Lunalios> keep that design useful
[3:05:03] <Daniel_Is_I> Apparently Arsene learns new skills all the way up to level 95
[3:05:04] <+ThomasOfTroy> @GarbageQueenEllie I really liked Leanan Sidhe
[3:05:05] <%GarbageQueenEllie> I'm glad Arsene gets more play here. He deserves it
[3:05:09] <WholesomeSandwhichPeddler> It takes like 20 for each move tho
[3:05:16] <OblivionSword1> Arsene's getting a lot more play huh
[3:05:24] <Calamity2007> At least they are making the main persona more useful
[3:05:27] <OneThousandTomatoes> @peachsaliva pat is putting pp in stuff
[3:05:27] <%AzureGale> I got Arsene in Dragalia Lost. He's pretty rad there
[3:05:28] <WholesomeSandwhichPeddler> 20 levels*
[3:05:29] <penitentpendant> Persona Games like making that starting persona Magikarp in power scale, which I'm okay with
[3:05:30] <Lunalios> Arsene is the best MC persona design
[3:05:31] <netrac> @Daniel_Is_I lvl 80 something I think
[3:05:34] <+CookieCutter007> top hat demon angel
[3:05:39] <Blank9> they know everyone likes the initial personas for characters
[3:05:41] <+SparrowHW> Raoul is cool too
[3:05:41] <%Wallabri> Main Character Main Persona need more love and screen time tbh, i'm happy for arsene
[3:05:44] <$KnightAsteran> wish we got Raoul in strikers
[3:05:59] <%AzureGale> KILL THE DOGGO
[3:06:11] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @KnightAsteran Duuuuude Raoul is pimp
[3:06:19] <%Burdenslo> Thantanos, izanagi, arsene all look fucking 10/10
[3:06:20] <enerkaizer> I wish they'd gone for second stage personas, esspecially if it's just a flatout sequel
[3:06:40] <%bravebravesrobin> Cheer500 Hey Pat, don't know if my new Subscriber message went through, but I'm a long time viewer (Machinima), who decided to go ahead and sub as a salutations for you engaging the Mustard Queen in Holy Matrimony.  Anyway, It was either subscribe to an Onlyfans or you, and I couldn't resist that hot orb action.
[3:06:47] <+Dragon4234> @PatStaresAt Don't forget that Joker's personas changes his C2 C3 and C5
[3:06:49] <rcand9> Hambush
[3:06:50] <%AzureGale> I love it when lines repeat!
[3:06:51] <Calamity2007> @KnightAsteran Raoul is DLC only in P5R right?
[3:06:54] <%Wallabri> Hambush
[3:06:58] <Lunalios> shit I forgot thanatos. he's also really good
[3:07:00] <$KnightAsteran> yeah
[3:07:13] <@SoFarFetched> There you go SeemsGood @bravebravesrobin
[3:07:19] <%Calenrow> so this is just Musou-na
[3:07:20] <%bravebravesrobin> Holy fuck, big boomer energy right here
[3:07:21] <Saltmeisterr> YEAH SLIM
[3:07:23] <%ringabal> Haru- HARU THEY'RE ALREADY DEAD
[3:07:24] <%DappercatEsquire> congratulations to slime
[3:07:25] <Calamity2007> Thanatos is probably my favorite main character Persona
[3:07:28] <%asgard147> limesYay
[3:07:29] <+SparrowHW> the thigh high boots really ruin Thanatos for me
[3:07:30] <Lunalios> unfortunately. Raoul's a perfect evolution
[3:07:32] <+Dragon4234> @PatStaresAt Don't forget that Joker's personas changes his C2 C3 and C5.
[3:07:40] <@SoFarFetched> twitch commands can be specific in here where one symbol/letter/number can ruin it.
[3:07:48] <$KnightAsteran> Raoul shouldnt have been DLC tho, hes just the MCs third awakening, he should be in the game properly
[3:07:53] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Haru's bloodlust is legit terrifying. I want to travel the world with her
[3:07:59] <rcand9> @bravebravesrobin pat reads stuff at the beginning and the end im sure he will see it just fyi
[3:08:00] <s1rcuit> @bravebravesrobin idk if he saw it or not, but I saw you just now, and I will thank you
[3:08:07] <+thechungiestofbois> the worst part of every persona game is when you have to fuse your cool starting persona for some garbo
[3:08:07] <SPidERMan8576> doodDerp
[3:08:12] <%bravebravesrobin> doesn't help I'm on the mobile app
[3:08:13] <+Dragon4234> @GarbageQueenEllie Wait until you see her behind the wheel
[3:08:20] <%arcielardor> So Who's the new whackadoo you've got to reform in this chapter?
[3:08:23] <Calamity2007> @Lunalios Yeah and I doubt they will bring their perfect evolutions in this game though hopefully they get their Personas's second forms
[3:08:31] <Lunalios> @knightasteran I agree
[3:08:39] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @Dragon4234 Women Drivers, ammirite boys?
[3:08:59] <penitentpendant> @arcielardor A person writing bad cookie cutter isekai
[3:09:06] <huskarl_zap> wait who crashed?
[3:09:06] <%arcielardor> freaky
[3:09:10] <%asgard147> Map, see? limesGiggle
[3:09:19] <%AzureGale> Mapsi gves you a map
[3:09:24] <jjeefberky> what the fuck is this how have i not heard about this
[3:09:32] <SPidERMan8576> Makoto‚Äôs the best girl
[3:09:35] <+Dragon4234> @PatStaresAt gonna check how each persona changes Joker?
[3:09:37] <%ringabal> Chill the Key
[3:09:38] <enerkaizer> P5 Arena is going to be wild, considering this would be the first time 2 wildcard users would meet. Plus a fight between Izanagi and Satanael would be world breaking propably
[3:09:38] <%DappercatEsquire> @PatStaresAt do you find ambushing those flying shadows out of cover super finnicky?
[3:09:43] <DirgeNovak> I wish Sojiro got a persona in this
[3:09:48] <KahnWick> So is this just a Musou but with an actual challenge
[3:09:49] <%arcielardor> so first was a succubus fashion model, next is a fanfic writer
[3:09:56] <@SoFarFetched> Id pay money for that
[3:09:58] <@SoFarFetched> and pet elmo
[3:09:58] <jjeefberky> zangief will be a tired boy
[3:10:00] <jjeefberky> after that
[3:10:00] <penitentpendant> @jjeefberky It's an Atlus game, so word of mouth is hard to travel when they nuke any media of it
[3:10:01] <rcand9> hes a GOOD BOY
[3:10:03] <+Minorou> and he will fart in everyone's faces
[3:10:04] <Saltmeisterr> what about Smellmo?
[3:10:04] <%AzureGale> Wouldn't that hurt after a while
[3:10:07] <%asgard147> limesAw psaDogchamp
[3:10:09] <Parapattern> Give him kisses!
[3:10:09] <%barrakuta371> I would so pay for that
[3:10:09] <%blaccbird914> Cant wait :)
[3:10:10] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Zangief would make a great Persona
[3:10:10] <mortificent> I'd pay for that
[3:10:14] <rcand9> <3 barf energy
[3:10:16] <%miguelrod777> then he'll tackle someone to the floor
[3:10:18] <%ringabal> @arcielardor And we all know which is the greater evil
[3:10:19] <%arcielardor> @patstaresat would you visit florida?
[3:10:20] <$NoctisxMog> i will go to a con just to see Geif
[3:10:21] <+thechungiestofbois> will he dog nut on one of us?
[3:10:23] <+Ancopro> for free dang
[3:10:24] <+mental_mashup> can you sign my xangief barf?
[3:10:26] <%MidnightBurst12> blessings
[3:10:27] <%Mrbaconator> pat some places you have to pay for that
[3:10:38] <DirgeNovak> I'll settle for seeing you at Place Dupuis and being too shy to say hi again
[3:10:39] <vonmaultke> He not best dog, my dog best dog
[3:10:40] <%Movemeister> When will the Pat be able to drive
[3:10:44] <gamingspacesloth> At no extra cost?
[3:10:49] <mortificent> so chat, who were your endgame party in P5? mine was Makoto, Yusuke, Ann
[3:10:53] <zhenthrim213> PRINCIPALITY is broken
[3:10:57] <+CookieCutter007> GUN
[3:11:02] <rcand9> YEAAAAA
[3:11:03] <Parapattern> Slithering Snake Woman? Paige?!
[3:11:07] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Oh fuck yeah
[3:11:07] <%PanicSwytch> If he does barf on me, I will never wash that shirt LUL
[3:11:12] <Serge_12> Can someone let me know how long this game is?
[3:11:18] <Saltmeisterr> oh hey its that boss from Automata
[3:11:20] <%AzureGale> "SHOW"S OVER" *the show continues*
[3:11:21] <zhenthrim213> principality cast Media in its frickin combo
[3:11:23] <%Burdenslo> @mortificent makoto, Morgana, ryuji
[3:11:23] <%TheWinged7> @mortificent Makoto, Ryuji, Yusuke
[3:11:24] <$Afterman_> @Serge_12 30-45 hours
[3:11:30] <DirgeNovak> 50ish hours
[3:11:35] <Snorlax321> the person he barfs on has to pay extra
[3:11:42] <%Ziegsy> is pat saving his exp points?
[3:11:45] <Serge_12> Oh snap Thanks!
[3:11:47] <%Movemeister> Ann, Ryuji, Yusuke
[3:12:01] <+thechungiestofbois> Ryuji, Yusuke, Makoto
[3:12:04] <SPidERMan8576> Whoever gets barfed on gets to take pat out for dinner
[3:12:05] <penitentpendant> Woolie'd it there
[3:12:06] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @patstaresat Would you say this gameplay style is better for Persona?
[3:12:11] <%GarbageQueenEllie> I can see how it might be annoying, but I personally love RPG's where the characters talk to each other constantly
[3:12:33] <%Ziegsy> I always have sophia in my team she has an AMAZING master skill
[3:12:36] <Lunalios> in JRPG I always give everyone equal attention but if I'd pick, P5: Makoto, Haru, Yusuke. P5R: Makoto, Akechi, Yusuke.
[3:12:37] <+Dragon4234> @PatStaresAt Make sure to grab the item recover + bond skill it works on SP recover too
[3:12:37] <+thechungiestofbois> Hakerman
[3:12:38] <penitentpendant> @GarbageQueenEllie It's mostly on how often lines are repeated
[3:12:43] <DirgeNovak> IT'S REYN TIME
[3:12:48] <rcand9> id pay to see a ryuji compilation of him just killing every boss with a regular bat swing
[3:12:52] <%Broken_Sonex> @GarbageQueenEllie It only works when it's new dialog.
[3:13:11] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @penitentpendant This is true. If you're gonna go big, go HUGE. Like terabites of lines.
[3:13:33] <%Broken_Sonex> @GarbageQueenEllie If it's not new dialog all the time then it gets fucking grating.
[3:13:41] <%Ziegsy> Pats music sounds different to mine. did he use the music change option?
[3:13:50] <%KineticZen> All according to keikaku, Joker
[3:13:57] <%Burdenslo> I‚Äôd love to see the persona games use the chrono trigger style of combo moves it‚Äôd be hype
[3:13:59] <+thechungiestofbois> SIMP CAT
[3:14:16] <%arcielardor> epilepsy warning
[3:14:29] <SPidERMan8576> Is futaba playable in this?
[3:14:45] <%Ziegsy> @spiderman8576 no ;;
[3:14:46] <%KineticZen> OK that's sick
[3:14:46] <DirgeNovak> no
[3:14:51] <rcand9> yeyeye
[3:14:56] <Lunalios> radical
[3:14:57] <%asgard147> limesPoggers
[3:15:03] <+SparrowHW> these are way better than those combo attacks in Royal
[3:15:06] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Man I think the only actual reason I can't stand Morgana is the simp thing. It's just cringey and uncomfortable. Otherwise, he'd be ok
[3:15:09] <%chiazam> Is Pat playing this on PC or PS5?
[3:15:16] <Parapattern> The biggest issue is that the bulk of their lines are for stuff that doesn't need their comment on.

[3:19:52] <thestoreemporium> so is this game good?
[3:19:58] <%GarbageQueenEllie> I love being able to hear Joker's voice more in this. He's the coolest.
[3:19:59] <leinadtonu> Damnit Pat, you're influencing me to buy this game.

[3:21:51] <mortificent> @allovera hey, Raidou lives on in Persona, since it's canon to that universe
[3:21:53] <%walternatorz> the zangief's vision is food based. if there is no promise of food, he is blind.
[3:21:53] <B1ak3N1k05999> Zangief spots he‚Äôs prey
[3:22:00] <Visorak6> super not true futaba
[3:22:06] <%AzureGale> I bet he got the award and then it was taken away
[3:22:10] <%GarbageQueenEllie> You guys think they'll start porting other Persona titles to Steam as well? I'd love to get P3P on there
[3:22:13] <wantedsafe471> I doubt that statement very much futaba
[3:22:14] <%ShutUpAceyP> is sophia new?
[3:22:16] <%DappercatEsquire> the end of this guy's Jail/storyline has kind of a fucked up message
[3:22:19] <%weissguard> Did Futaba really just say that? That's literally how Madarame got to be famous! LUL
[3:22:30] <%KineticZen> Dog not feel asleep
[3:22:33] <%maskofmichael> Go Dog Go
[3:22:35] <penitentpendant> I'm gonna guess he had good original work. But it wasn't selling so he went with trite derivative work because it's easier/better received.
[3:22:39] <TurtlesAndTentacles> but
[3:22:40] <SPidERMan8576> Doggo time
[3:22:41] <+loukemia83> "You can't win an award just by ripping people off" These kids haven't heard of videogames I guess

[3:22:42] <%asgard147> "I move for Food" psaDogchamp
[3:22:46] <AllenDeadman> I like how the general consensus for this game seems to be actual surprised that it's this good.
[3:22:54] <+alloVera> @mortificent wish they'd bring back the kuzunoha detective agency at least, since i thought that was always fun in the old personas
[3:23:01] <%wembleyttv> No it is
[3:23:02] <Mattais88> Doens't even cost you a day this time either
[3:23:04] <%AzureGale> @GarbageQueenEllie Man, I wish P3P got a full 3D makeover but a port would be acceptable
[3:23:11] <B1ak3N1k05999> Everybody talks about porting P3-5 to steam. But no wants to talk about 1-2.
[3:23:13] <%wembleyttv> Well like if you let it get to 100%
[3:23:31] <%Ranryu692> that's because Persona 1 and 2 need work
[3:23:34] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt would you rather have a Persona or a Stand?
[3:23:42] <penitentpendant> @AllenDeadman Musou games have a track record for not being the best. It's only been recent as a surge of quality
[3:23:45] <%DappercatEsquire> time to START BLASTIN
[3:23:46] <SPidERMan8576> I find it hard to replay persona 1 and 2 lol
[3:23:47] <AllenDeadman> @B1ak3N1k05999 gotta port the popular ones first to lower their guard, and then start the operation to revive at least 2
[3:23:49] <%AzureGale> Is this an Indiana Jones reference
[3:23:50] <wantedsafe471> Oh no, its the crystal caves all over again
[3:23:53] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @AzureGale That'd be awesome. Get it all on PC- Atlus gets to roll in moola, and we get Personers. Everybody wins!
[3:23:59] <%Ranryu692> I tried playing SMT: Persona last year, and that walk speed is FUUUCKED
[3:23:59] <DirgeNovak> That would be because Persona 1 and 2 are shit
[3:24:00] <mortificent> @allovera I'd love to see it taken over by Yu and Naoto, since those two are the city detective friends
[3:24:04] <%wibbwobbler> woo p3 let's go
[3:24:12] <B1ak3N1k05999> @allendeadman Oh ok
[3:24:20] <penitentpendant> Dog has returned to sleep
[3:24:41] <i_need_sciss0rz> hopefully this sets a precedent to get other persona games on switch?
[3:24:46] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Man that is load snore

[3:24:53] <mortificent> just read a wiki for P1, that game aged POORLY
[3:25:03] <%Ranryu692> @i_need_sciss0rz Persona Q 2 has been on the switch for like a year
[3:25:14] <%Puhff> OH NO I HIT ENTER TOO EARLY
[3:25:17] <DirgeNovak> wat
[3:25:19] <SPidERMan8576> musou games is so much better on ps5 now
[3:25:23] <SPidERMan8576> With no load times
[3:25:28] <%Ranryu692> @Puhff F
[3:25:32] <%ShutUpAceyP> wait. isn't this supposed to be a muso game?
[3:25:34] <i_need_sciss0rz> @ranryu692 oops lol
[3:25:38] <badzombie28> hows the game so far?
[3:25:56] <penitentpendant> @ShutUpAceyP It's both
[3:26:04] <SPidERMan8576> It is a musou
[3:26:14] <rcand9> do you think that atlus is waiting to announce p3 so they can stealth drop it on stream at a big event or something?
[3:26:16] <%AzureGale> When there's a problem, use car. And if that don't work, use more car.
[3:26:26] <s1rcuit> when the superhero uses the car you're still making payments on as a weapon NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[3:26:32] <%ShutUpAceyP> is this PC version or PS5?
[3:26:34] <DirgeNovak> Persona Q is not on Switch, whoever said that
[3:26:42] <thestoreemporium> i still cant tell if this games good or not
[3:26:45] <penitentpendant> When a "Used Car Lot" creates the response "Oh boy, more ammo!"
[3:26:50] <+loukemia83> Adachi should have had the power of CAR in Y7
[3:27:01] <s1rcuit> @ShutUpAceyP PC I think
[3:27:04] <i_need_sciss0rz> @dirgenovak my understanding was this is the first one
[3:27:14] <mortificent> god, living in a superhero universe sucks, all that supervillain insurance
[3:27:16] <%Ranryu692> @DirgeNovak shit, you're right. I forgot that was 3DS
[3:27:34] <rcand9> @thestoreemporium so far everything points to good
[3:27:34] <DirgeNovak> The only Persona on Switch is this
[3:27:43] <+SeventhVice> Wow no Makoto huh. Unfollow
[3:27:44] <%ringabal> Imagine if Kiryu stopped using bikes to bash people heads with a Toyota.
[3:27:46] <SPidERMan8576> lol
[3:28:02] <SPidERMan8576> what if theres a yakuza musou
[3:28:10] <thestoreemporium> only big the cat can use cars
[3:28:14] <%GarbageQueenEllie> What if. You wanted to max out the Empress. But Haru said: "nOtEvEnWoRtHmYtImE"
[3:28:15] <i_need_sciss0rz> @dirgenovak why I said I wonder if this will get other ones on switch since the gears are moving?
[3:28:18] <AllenDeadman> well, I don't want to spoil myself from thisbgame too much so I'll leave now
[3:28:21] <thestoreemporium> @rcand9 thanks! here's hoping
[3:28:22] <AllenDeadman> Have a good one y'all
[3:28:23] <%ShutUpAceyP> so does this game make P5R non canon?
[3:28:29] <mortificent> Imagine having to pay insurance in case Venom crashes through your window
[3:28:30] <s1rcuit> why so blast?
[3:28:56] <huskarl_zap> Praise rngesus
[3:28:58] <+loukemia83> Blast Processing "Does what Arsen don't"
[3:28:58] <rcand9> @ShutUpAceyP no and yes?
[3:28:59] <Go4theKnees> @ShutUpAceyP no? Kasumi isnt even in japan when this game takes place
[3:29:01] <B1ak3N1k05999> It‚Äôs Pat‚Äôs favorite enemy
[3:29:01] <heartlesshealer> She's running a master system
[3:29:07] <wantedsafe471> whenever I hear blast processing, all i hear is AVGN
[3:29:17] <%asgard147> Why's there so much rotting meat in this place? Bad Writing? limesThink
[3:29:18] <penitentpendant> @mortificent At least it's a brand name villain, imagine having to try to fill out a form for a villain you don't even recognize
[3:29:30] <rcand9> she loves murder
[3:29:30] <$SGrim> Oh no, she's perfect
[3:29:33] <$KnightAsteran> Sophie big cute

[3:29:55] <%ShutUpAceyP> @Go4theKnees lol maybe I should finish P5R before watching this game
[3:29:56] <mortificent> @penitentpendant lol, imagine having to pay because SHOCKER broke your car
[3:29:59] <NamelessRedWolf> @ShutUpAceyP I'm about 30 hours in and nothing has contradicted Royal so far.
[3:30:00] <$SGrim> Chat help, Im about to start simping
[3:30:10] <penitentpendant> @asgard147 Well it's supposed to be derivative of old 8-bit games. So 'lots of slime' fits
[3:30:14] <Go4theKnees> Yusuke is nutty, his counter is so good
[3:30:17] <%spacedroner1> How's the PC port for this game
[3:30:23] <SPidERMan8576> Meat couldnt stand the beating

[3:30:35] <+tempestzephyr> CHUNK
[3:30:36] <Saltmeisterr> yeow
[3:30:39] <kozboz96> thoughts on the game?
[3:30:42] <%twistedj3ster> The Switch is the worst version I'd say
[3:30:43] <huskarl_zap> But shes all amogus
[3:30:51] <rcand9> does he still fuck in scramble?
[3:30:55] <%asgard147> @penitentpendant, ah i see limesO
[3:31:01] <s1rcuit> what do they do?
[3:31:02] <+king_of_beggars> Hey I haven't noticed but is there input lag on pulling your gun? On PS5 pulling up your persona is instant, but there's a like half second delay in drawing your gun.
[3:31:02] <Cymen90> So what exactly IS this game? Is it a new game or a remix of P5?
[3:31:13] <coldfire0007> Does the PC version have a way of getting the Royal soundtrack?
[3:31:14] <$KnightAsteran> sequel
[3:31:16] <%GarbageQueenEllie> So like, what if a person is cool all the time, but happens to simp? Are you allowed to only be lame or simp, never both?
[3:31:17] <rcand9> new game
[3:31:17] <%AzureGale> I don't think rescue pills are used for fucking :x
[3:31:19] <+rbakervv> @Cymen90 it's a seque;
[3:31:21] <ClarkWasHere> huh
[3:31:24] <Cymen90> OH
[3:31:29] <%twistedj3ster> but I wouldn't call it a musuo
[3:31:31] <+allups> is there still exploration? like walking around japan and school and stuff
[3:31:32] <Daniel_Is_I> Did the first boss with 2 dead party members because I didn't have any revival items. Now I buy the pills at every opporrtunity.
[3:31:50] <$SGrim> @GarbageQueenEllie you can totally be a lame simp. It's easy.
[3:31:50] <penitentpendant> Wow, Downgraded Minibosses again
[3:31:54] <bear_breaker20> "pills are lit get them"
[3:31:55] <mortificent> OH YEAH, this has a remix of the OG Persona 1 Battle theme
[3:31:58] <%aishman> @PatStaresAt So have you decided it Zangief or Elmo will be the ring bearer during THE BIG DAY?
[3:32:13] <huskarl_zap> Whens AMOGUS Bersona?
[3:32:20] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @SGrim Yeah, but like, which is worse? Could you be lame, but still be better than someone who's cool, but a simp?
[3:32:30] <+lucaflowe> How are you enjoying this game?
[3:32:37] <+BigChiefBear> looks like one of those joke huds
[3:32:39] <Link232> The game is like five persona battles going on at once alongside the usual musou crowds
[3:32:44] <+lucaflowe> Also congrats on the proposal!
[3:33:17] <mortificent> KILL THAT DRONE
[3:33:26] <$SGrim> @GarbageQueenEllie simping is the most significant downgrade you can apply to yourself without delving into the violation of other people's bodily or emotional autonomy. Lame is way better.
[3:33:28] <rcand9> how would you compare this to say ff7R just for some context?
[3:33:45] <Cymen90> This looks chaotic but at least it is not the usual JRPG combat
[3:34:11] <AllenDeadman> that's insane
[3:34:14] <%cvp5127> so never kick her out
[3:34:16] <$SGrim> Oh, so she's a straight DPS main hitter.
[3:34:20] <Daniel_Is_I> Tarunda is -attack, not defense
[3:34:23] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @SGrim I thought so. It's better to be uncool or unpopular as long as you're respectful and have your dignity
[3:34:31] <Link232> Yeah some of Joker's autocombos get free versions with certain Personas as well
[3:34:43] <%twistedj3ster> Chat, did he try to take on the  Dire Shadow?
[3:34:44] <Daniel_Is_I> Rakunda is the defense reduction
[3:34:46] <SPidERMan8576> Is she a ninja?
[3:34:48] <Mattais88> She's my second favourite AI persona character, after Labrys
[3:34:52] <zecht89> who is this weird space channel 5 knock off
[3:34:54] <%ringabal> @PatStaresAt Has Ryuji used his F word pass yet?
[3:34:54] <rcand9> ryuji should be strong he had an insta kill
[3:34:55] <HeroToxiko> he's dumb so he had to be tough
[3:34:58] <$SGrim> @GarbageQueenEllie also, Lame can often turn into self-deprecation, which is the best form of humor.
[3:35:10] <huskarl_zap> FORSKIN CLIPPER?
[3:35:21] <%Monkeyweed21> rip your face off
[3:35:24] <tattleworm> with this, sometimes, you rip the skin
[3:35:25] <Cymen90> FEED THE GOBLINS
[3:35:25] <penitentpendant> Ah yes, the exponential power of investing in GREED as soon as possible in an RPG
[3:35:42] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @SGrim True.
[3:35:56] <%SveriSageAdvice> but what about your Nae Nae
[3:36:00] <%spacedroner1> Atlus really nails the UI design every time
[3:36:03] <wantedsafe471> So its a barbed whip? brutal
[3:36:10] <%DappercatEsquire> @PatStaresAt think you'll make it to the end of this jail? kinda curious on how you react to how it resolves

[3:46:56] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @Broken_Sonex I prefer the Ann who's emotionally intelligent and likes crepes way too much, and is occasionally silly as per typical for a teen girl.
[3:46:59] <rcand9> ryuji the big dtrong
[3:47:00] <SPidERMan8576> Joker went to smash
[3:47:01] <%cvp5127> isnt ann immune to fire

[3:47:56] <+yoshkosh20> does morgana still give ryuuji a ton of shit in this game?
[3:47:58] <%spacedroner1> So did the cast lose their evolved/max confidant personas between P5 and P5S?

[3:48:30] <rcand9> hes doing tons of damage
[3:48:31] <+paladinstarbuster> @Broken_Sonex probably because due to her aforementioned character arc she can handle it better. Her persona is literally Carmen

[3:55:33] <%arcielardor> the flop
[3:55:38] <s1rcuit> @deepether it's almost as if...the game was rigged from the start
[3:55:41] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @Broken_Sonex I still love Ann as a character though. She's super cool and powerful, while still managing to be fun and silly. Kind of like a Sailor Moon character.
[3:55:47] <syanplague> @BallerSwagBro9k he was hearing a his headphones on a Spy stream and went into the bathroom
[3:55:53] <+deepether> some sorta shuffle

[3:59:04] <rcand9> i was not expecting this at all

[4:03:18] <masterfire23> ains
[4:03:18] <%DappercatEsquire> @PatStaresAt a funny joke for later

[4:03:24] <zhenthrim213> @abrupt_abe you have not seen anything yet
[4:03:26] <%GarbageQueenEllie> He looks like he tried to cosplay CastleVania and failed
[4:03:26] <Daniel_Is_I> He was very subtly moving
[4:03:28] <%viewtifulr> John isekai
[4:03:30] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt because he's sooo poorly written
[4:03:35] <%AzureGale> Vroom...
[4:03:42] <%Monkeyweed21> T-posing for dominance
[4:03:47] <%goose_attack_almanac> He's as stiff and unmoving as his writing

[4:04:57] <Sol_Install> P5 > P5S > P5R
[4:05:15] <huskarl_zap> This is a boomer reunion

[4:15:21] <+cafefunk> Ren?
[4:15:23] <%aishman> So why is everyone sleeping in an RV??
[4:15:23] <%spacedroner1> Glad the Persona 5 style is intact
[4:15:29] <Daniel_Is_I> You pick the name at the start.
[4:15:37] <%Arancet> official name has always been Ren
[4:15:37] <%spacedroner1> It was Akira but the anime changed it or some shit
[4:15:40] <%GalacticaPhanto> @meekest he's had one but you name your character in this one like the previous games
[4:15:44] <%goose_attack_almanac> No I want to be thirsty
[4:15:45] <huskarl_zap> Date?
[4:15:45] <Daniel_Is_I> As per the anime, Joker's name is Ren Amamiya. The manga names aren't canon.'
[4:15:50] <%asgard147> Thanks Hyru-bot limesSip
[4:15:51] <%AzureGale> Epic ass-loot

[4:15:58] <%shurtal> i had a bran fart, and from that shot of joker outside the camper, i couldn't tell if this was Persona, or Final Fantasy 15
[4:16:00] <Blank9> you name yourself in this game
[4:16:01] <Kriss1827> @cafefunk according to the dancing games its ren
[4:16:03] <Blank9> like p5
[4:16:08] <KidKaiser23> I love Ren as a name
[4:16:08] <+krlos970> @cafefunk Akira in the anime Ren in the game
[4:16:14] <syanplague> cool thanks
[4:16:26] <%TheWinged7> i still think Akira Kurusu is a better name
[4:16:28] <%spacedroner1> Ren Mammamia
[4:16:37] <+yoshkosh20> ew
[4:16:39] <Zerotoad5> Its Ren in the Anime
[4:16:50] <Hyphixsys> sounds good Kappa
[4:16:53] <KidKaiser23> He never struck me as cool enough for Akira
[4:16:59] <KidKaiser23> From a design standpoint
[4:17:01] <%TheWinged7> dont you want your salty milkies @PatStaresAt  Kappa
[4:17:05] <aeonicvector> Its Joker Persona5 in the smush community Kappa
[4:17:07] <KidKaiser23> Still a fantastic name in general tho
[4:17:08] <huskarl_zap> Salt milk = coom
[4:17:28] <Zerotoad5> I like the Snow Thunder Rain theme for the MCs
[4:17:28] <tukds> @krlos970 it's Akira in the Manga and Ren in the anime and game, It's like Calling Yu Seta instead
[4:17:29] <KidKaiser23> @aeonicvector I thought it was John Persona Kappa
[4:17:36] <%spacedroner1> >tfw no hot blonde friend to feed me candy

[4:18:16] <huskarl_zap> What if walking erection appeared?
[4:18:25] <%Broken_Sonex> Did they make the girls thicker in this game? Cuz i don't remember Ann having those thighs.

[4:27:03] <Daniel_Is_I> I don't think she's any stronger now than she was the first fight

[4:27:29] <Kriss1827> this game on hard is a fucking challenge

[4:27:54] <zhenthrim213> @Kriss1827 you said it
[4:27:57] <@SoFarFetched> On Hard? More like Hard on.

[4:30:39] <WSintai> Pats playing on his couch Kappa
[4:30:42] <%Monkeyweed21> damn bitch you thirsty
[4:30:48] <godzookylives> this fight is incredibly horny
[4:31:04] <TurtlesAndTentacles> cant wait for Doujins of Alice
[4:31:05] <%Broken_Sonex> We gotta leak her OnlyFans, that's the only way to beat her
[4:31:19] <KidKaiser23> You gotta go all out on sum like that
[4:31:32] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Just wait until she gets old and saggy. Then she'll have no power
[4:31:36] <WSintai> Paige is NEVER ok
[4:31:49] <%goose_attack_almanac> She's a 15ft rabbit woman in skimpy clothes with a massive ass that has Eat Me tattooed on it. I'd be surprised if no one beat it to her.
[4:31:50] <%kewlmyc> I hear this game is grind heavy.
[4:31:57] <waffleandman> can you imagine age of calamity at 60 fps
[4:32:05] <WholesomeSandwhichPeddler> It really not
[4:32:09] <%ringabal> SPEEN THE CAR CAT
[4:32:10] <SSgansta> does this take place after p5
[4:32:12] <%DorianCreed> Giga Van Breaker
[4:32:27] <@SoFarFetched> @SSgansta yes 3 months after
[4:32:36] <%kewlmyc> Did it say "EAT ME" on her ass?
[4:32:41] <huskarl_zap> No lacoocaracha horn 0 outta 10
[4:32:47] <huskarl_zap> yes
[4:32:50] <%GarbageQueenEllie> That boss was so SUBTLE
[4:32:51] <LorcaNomad> it super did
[4:32:52] <%ShogunNoonto> i'm tired of being horny i just what to be happy
[4:32:52] <wantedsafe471> lol
[4:32:53] <+allups> i love that shit
[4:32:55] <DocSabo> man i really hope we get a persona 5 arena.
[4:32:56] <Sol_Install> Hmmm
[4:32:58] <Dr_Mooose> they knew
[4:33:10] <%Broken_Sonex> Do what the tattoo asks, it would be rude not to.
[4:33:12] <Daniel_Is_I> Phantom Dash attacks are the environmental attacks
[4:33:17] <TehMud> wenvironmental attacks
[4:33:20] <+eldrinos> when you do the attacks off the environment
[4:33:22] <%maskofmichael> a dash that a phantom does
[4:33:25] <TurtlesAndTentacles> I sure hope this didnt awaken something in me
[4:33:25] <%Ipsenscastle> @ShogunNoonto god that's fucking relatable
[4:33:27] <Daniel_Is_I> Like making cars explode or dropping chandeliers
[4:33:28] <+Dragon4234> @PatStaresAt Phantom Dashes are interactives
[4:33:31] <%Monkeyweed21> when you dash to shid
[4:33:53] <+Dragon4234> @PatStaresAt The Item Recover one is great since it affects SP recover from items too
[4:33:55] <%YakumoYomi> This is franchise with a giant penis demon. Seeing "eat me" on some rabbit's ass is pretty tame
[4:33:56] <KidKaiser23> When you do da Dash on these hoes in a Phantom
[4:33:58] <%NopeBadguy> So I don't typically like musous. How is this game?
[4:34:05] <%NopeBadguy> It looks a lot closer to a straight up action RPG
[4:34:08] <%NopeBadguy> Than a musou
[4:34:25] <Daniel_Is_I> 705 -> Castle
[4:34:30] <KidKaiser23> Jumping from light to light like that is fuckin sick
[4:34:32] <WholesomeSandwhichPeddler> You can turn in quests anywhere beside when you‚Äôre moving in a dungeon
[4:34:35] <%Arkfyre> that's the side path where the search lights were
[4:35:08] <SlashingIce> @nopebadguy I could hardly call this a musou
[4:35:12] <+DrHentaiPhD> Gawddamn those menus cum
[4:35:29] <%bread_assassin> Y'know a Null Phys Persona would probably be super broken in this game.
[4:35:39] <+chrispunchesboulder> I'm kinda of mad that Akechi isn't in the game. I bet he will be DLC
[4:35:42] <KidKaiser23> Platforming?!
[4:35:54] <%spacedroner1> Is this Persona 5: The Dark Carnival?
[4:36:01] <huskarl_zap> That bear is nutmare fuel
[4:36:04] <snipertheladiesman> @patstaresat how are u liking the game. I'm interested in it and like this gameplay more, and got bored of persona 5 before futaba dungeon after 40 hrs
[4:36:13] <KidKaiser23> @chrispunchesboulder Need him and Kasumi
[4:36:20] <+Dragon4234> @PatStaresAt Why not just use GUN to shot the aerial ones down
[4:36:21] <+allups> i love persona 5's style so much
[4:36:29] <%spacedroner1> @snipertheladiesman aww man her palace had one of the best songs in the game
[4:36:33] <%Ipsenscastle> @huskarl_zap was that a freudian slip or a creepy joke
[4:36:43] <%Monkeyweed21> Succubuses @PatStaresAt
[4:36:52] <%Monkeyweed21> the ones you just killed
[4:37:01] <%Arkfyre> you just need to hit their weakness 3 times
[4:37:03] <KidKaiser23> @huskarl_zap I like the cut of your jib
[4:37:12] <%Monkeyweed21> hit the weakness on the succubus
[4:37:15] <+Kraftium> the request isn't a set thing its just a "kill 5 of this enemy quest"
[4:37:34] <TheSphereHunter> 448 raiders from TheSphereHunter have joined!

[4:38:59] <%DappercatEsquire> ALREADY DID

[4:39:01] <Dr_Mooose> the tease
[4:39:07] <mortificent> Pat is out here influencing
[4:39:11] <%Agami23> yeah this game needed better advertising, they made it look like a muso for ages.
[4:39:15] <+TaurusOxford> SO this game is legit? Just wanting confirmation.
[4:39:23] <%AzureGale> LUL
[4:39:24] <%DappercatEsquire> because i'm wrong sometimes
[4:39:34] <%Ipsenscastle> called out on lack of ice cream knowledge
[4:39:42] <@SoFarFetched> what if you're wrong about the second boss being close? then double balls exposed.
[4:39:44] <%Monkeyweed21> you need to see how bad the message of the second jail is
[4:39:50] <%LetsBeBadAtVideoGames> 30 second review of the game?
[4:39:52] <%spacedroner1> Is Sophia just Amadeus 2.0
[4:39:58] <%NopeBadguy> Because you're finally learning how to use your Stand on others
[4:40:00] <@SoFarFetched> and then someone's gotta one up it with triple balls exposed
[4:40:03] <%NopeBadguy> Crazy Talk is getting stronger
[4:40:09] <%king_wragles> Wait hold on
[4:40:13] <%AzureGale> Are you double checking the are you double checking the
[4:40:14] <TheSphereHunter> ARE YOU DOUBE-ARE YOU DOUBLE-ARE YOU DOUBLE
[4:40:23] <%king_wragles> Did Pat just Crazy Talk Dapper from being wrong into being right?
[4:40:25] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Ann looks at the ice cream and just dumps it on the highway
[4:40:35] <Jokobeast> I feel like there's a mix in there somewhere. "Are you double-chec-are you double-ch-are you double..."
[4:40:44] <mortificent> Are you double checking your request, tho
[4:41:02] <Jokobeast> @mortificent Dunno m8, let's check again LUL
[4:41:03] <%NopeBadguy> Aboot?

[4:41:09] <%DappercatEsquire> @king_wragles what a fickle stand
[4:41:11] <$lotharrio> So is this like a continuation?

[4:41:40] <+allups> put em awy during the pod i love it during the streams tho
[4:41:43] <skyentombment> I feel like Persona is a game some people play to be cool by proxy, cuz the characters are so cool
[4:41:52] <$lotharrio> Neat
[4:42:06] <%spacedroner1> Shouldn't Futaba and whoever else is under 18 be in school
[4:42:08] <mortificent> Doggo
